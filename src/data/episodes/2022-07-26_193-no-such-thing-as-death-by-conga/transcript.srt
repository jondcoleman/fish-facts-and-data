00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:19,780
 And welcome to another episode of "No Such Thing as a Fish" a weekly podcast coming

2
00:00:19,780 --> 00:00:22,860
 to you from the QI offices in Covern, Darden.

3
00:00:22,860 --> 00:00:27,500
 My name is Dan Schreiber, I am sitting here with Anna Chazinski, James Harkin and Andrew

4
00:00:27,500 --> 00:00:31,940
 Hunter Murray and once again we have gathered around the microphones with our four favorite

5
00:00:31,940 --> 00:00:37,420
 facts from the last seven days and in no particular order here we go.

6
00:00:37,420 --> 00:00:39,300
 Starting with you, James Harkin.

7
00:00:39,300 --> 00:00:44,420
 Okay my fat this week is that it used to be thought that you couldn't testify in court

8
00:00:44,420 --> 00:00:47,700
 if you'd seen a crime through a window.

9
00:00:47,700 --> 00:00:49,700
 This is such an amazing fact.

10
00:00:49,700 --> 00:00:50,700
 This is incredible.

11
00:00:50,700 --> 00:00:53,020
 But it used to be thought but it wasn't the case.

12
00:00:53,020 --> 00:00:58,480
 Well it certainly wasn't the case in the late 19th, early 20th century when these news

13
00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:06,280
 reports which were sent to me by a guy on Twitter called Richard Tisdale at Ritchie T1892.

14
00:01:06,280 --> 00:01:09,460
 I think people often put the date they were born as their number don't they?

15
00:01:09,460 --> 00:01:11,300
 But I don't think he was born in 1892.

16
00:01:11,300 --> 00:01:14,620
 But this would explain why he knows about four cases from the late 20s.

17
00:01:14,620 --> 00:01:15,620
 That's true.

18
00:01:15,620 --> 00:01:18,180
 But he sent me a few different articles.

19
00:01:18,180 --> 00:01:24,100
 One for instance was an article entitled Extraordinary Belief in Shrewsbury and it was an

20
00:01:24,100 --> 00:01:30,300
 1928 report about this person in Shrewsbury who thought they'd seen a crime but they thought

21
00:01:30,300 --> 00:01:34,500
 they couldn't really be sure that they'd definitely seen it because it was through a window.

22
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:35,500
 And he sent me some others.

23
00:01:35,500 --> 00:01:40,140
 There was one in Wolverhampton, one in Lincolnshire, one in Ireland and the Irish one gives

24
00:01:40,140 --> 00:01:44,580
 a bit of extra material that it might be that this is because old glass used in windows

25
00:01:44,580 --> 00:01:48,460
 was often warped or blurred so maybe in the olden days you couldn't really see through

26
00:01:48,460 --> 00:01:49,740
 a window very well.

27
00:01:49,740 --> 00:01:54,060
 But then kind of folklore carried on and people actually thought if you saw a crime through

28
00:01:54,060 --> 00:01:56,660
 a window you couldn't be a reliable witness.

29
00:01:56,660 --> 00:02:01,980
 So always carry out your murders in a greenhouse or?

30
00:02:01,980 --> 00:02:05,260
 So these people are just people who saw crimes and didn't report them because they were

31
00:02:05,260 --> 00:02:07,420
 like well my testimony will be useless?

32
00:02:07,420 --> 00:02:12,620
 Or there were people who were in court and the judge said so did you see the crime and

33
00:02:12,620 --> 00:02:15,020
 they said well I kind of saw it.

34
00:02:15,020 --> 00:02:17,180
 It was through a window so it might not be true.

35
00:02:17,180 --> 00:02:20,660
 This completely invalidates the film rear window as a plot line.

36
00:02:20,660 --> 00:02:21,660
 Yeah.

37
00:02:21,660 --> 00:02:22,660
 You didn't see anything.

38
00:02:22,660 --> 00:02:23,660
 You didn't see shit.

39
00:02:23,660 --> 00:02:24,660
 What would have happened to me because I wear glasses.

40
00:02:24,660 --> 00:02:26,140
 I've got two windows on my face.

41
00:02:26,140 --> 00:02:27,140
 You can't see anything.

42
00:02:27,140 --> 00:02:28,140
 You think you can?

43
00:02:28,140 --> 00:02:29,140
 Yeah.

44
00:02:29,140 --> 00:02:30,140
 Wow.

45
00:02:30,140 --> 00:02:31,140
 It's all those crimes.

46
00:02:31,140 --> 00:02:35,380
 But it's not the windows were hard to see through because obviously in the very old

47
00:02:35,380 --> 00:02:39,980
 in days enough until probably about two to times then yeah as you say glass would warp

48
00:02:39,980 --> 00:02:44,460
 and you couldn't really see probably through a window and I think in ancient Rome when

49
00:02:44,460 --> 00:02:49,660
 they started making windows out of glass then it wasn't to illuminate a room and it wasn't

50
00:02:49,660 --> 00:02:50,820
 so that you could see through it.

51
00:02:50,820 --> 00:02:56,500
 It was just for decoration and insulation because the glass was so opaque basically.

52
00:02:56,500 --> 00:03:02,700
 Maybe it was because of stained glass so people were sort of reporting Jesus's crucifixion

53
00:03:02,700 --> 00:03:06,900
 and then realizing oh no hang on that's just that's part of the window I'm not going

54
00:03:06,900 --> 00:03:07,900
 to fall for that again.

55
00:03:07,900 --> 00:03:10,180
 I see an actual crime.

56
00:03:10,180 --> 00:03:11,180
 Yeah.

57
00:03:11,180 --> 00:03:12,180
 No.

58
00:03:12,180 --> 00:03:13,180
 Yeah.

59
00:03:13,180 --> 00:03:14,180
 I mean, yeah.

60
00:03:14,180 --> 00:03:15,180
 It's a theory isn't it?

61
00:03:15,180 --> 00:03:21,220
 We've mentioned before that the Inuit peoples used to use walrus penis membrane as a window.

62
00:03:21,220 --> 00:03:22,220
 They did.

63
00:03:22,220 --> 00:03:26,540
 And actually I would be quite annoyed if I was successfully prosecuted for crime I committed

64
00:03:26,540 --> 00:03:28,380
 through a walrus penis membrane.

65
00:03:28,380 --> 00:03:33,940
 Because we've seen pictures of these walrus penis membranes and they're not fully transparent

66
00:03:33,940 --> 00:03:37,940
 they're not I would say they're not even slightly transparent.

67
00:03:37,940 --> 00:03:43,060
 They also made windows out of oyster shells which again they're not transparent at all but

68
00:03:43,060 --> 00:03:47,300
 they kind of let a little bit of light through same with the membrane actually.

69
00:03:47,300 --> 00:03:53,660
 So I don't know when something stops being a wall and starts being a window isn't it?

70
00:03:53,660 --> 00:03:57,860
 For me oyster shells are just on the wrong side of the divide for each their own.

71
00:03:57,860 --> 00:04:02,340
 This is my beautiful new brick window.

72
00:04:02,340 --> 00:04:06,220
 Did you ever get told off by your parents with the phrase you make a better door than a

73
00:04:06,220 --> 00:04:07,220
 window?

74
00:04:07,220 --> 00:04:08,220
 No.

75
00:04:08,220 --> 00:04:09,220
 Oh.

76
00:04:09,220 --> 00:04:10,220
 As in you're standing in the way.

77
00:04:10,220 --> 00:04:13,260
 Basically when I was young and standing in front of the telly in between my parents and

78
00:04:13,260 --> 00:04:16,820
 the television they would say you make a better door than a window meaning you are opaque.

79
00:04:16,820 --> 00:04:21,780
 But apparently this doesn't now prohibit me from being a window if I choose to be.

80
00:04:21,780 --> 00:04:23,460
 Why were you standing in front of the TV?

81
00:04:23,460 --> 00:04:29,100
 Were you like look at me, look at me guys, I'm looking at the TV, I'm a performer, I'm playing

82
00:04:29,100 --> 00:04:30,100
 a door.

83
00:04:30,100 --> 00:04:37,700
 I think I was probably closest to the tree for my life to a bit.

84
00:04:37,700 --> 00:04:43,060
 Windows back in the day and I'm talking specifically the year 1590.

85
00:04:43,060 --> 00:04:48,380
 We're very very sort of treasured and they were just for that one year.

86
00:04:48,380 --> 00:04:52,260
 1590 was the big window year.

87
00:04:52,260 --> 00:04:56,580
 Basically if you had windows you treated them almost as a separate object to your entire

88
00:04:56,580 --> 00:04:57,580
 house.

89
00:04:57,580 --> 00:05:03,460
 For example there's accounts of people in their wills leaving the house to say the wife

90
00:05:03,460 --> 00:05:07,700
 but the windows to the sun, the family yeah.

91
00:05:07,700 --> 00:05:13,500
 And there's a castle called Annick Castle and again 1590 this is roughly the time this

92
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:18,180
 was reported when the residents of that castle went on holidays or were just going out for

93
00:05:18,180 --> 00:05:19,180
 a long time.

94
00:05:19,180 --> 00:05:22,900
 They would take the windows off and store them so that nothing would happen to them while

95
00:05:22,900 --> 00:05:23,900
 they were gone.

96
00:05:23,900 --> 00:05:24,900
 That's ridiculous.

97
00:05:24,900 --> 00:05:28,420
 So they can't get stolen but I think yeah exactly.

98
00:05:28,420 --> 00:05:31,900
 But then everything else in the building can get stolen because it's nothing in the windows

99
00:05:31,900 --> 00:05:34,940
 just got empty with their friends.

100
00:05:34,940 --> 00:05:35,940
 You might know this done.

101
00:05:35,940 --> 00:05:37,700
 Do you know why Annick Castle is famous?

102
00:05:37,700 --> 00:05:38,700
 No.

103
00:05:38,700 --> 00:05:40,700
 It's where they film the first series of Black Adder.

104
00:05:40,700 --> 00:05:43,460
 Oh they also film some of Harry Potter there.

105
00:05:43,460 --> 00:05:44,980
 Did they know?

106
00:05:44,980 --> 00:05:49,500
 But I think it had been famous for quite a few centuries before even Black Adder.

107
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:53,660
 That's probably why they chose to film there as opposed to no one have ever heard of

108
00:05:53,660 --> 00:05:54,660
 it.

109
00:05:54,660 --> 00:05:55,660
 Yeah.

110
00:05:55,660 --> 00:05:56,660
 How would they find out?

111
00:05:56,660 --> 00:06:00,260
 Do you think that would cause family tension if you inherited the windows and the other person

112
00:06:00,260 --> 00:06:01,260
 inherited the house?

113
00:06:01,260 --> 00:06:02,260
 Yes.

114
00:06:02,260 --> 00:06:03,260
 Yeah.

115
00:06:03,260 --> 00:06:04,260
 100%.

116
00:06:04,260 --> 00:06:05,260
 You'd be like, yeah.

117
00:06:05,260 --> 00:06:06,260
 Stop locking through my windows.

118
00:06:06,260 --> 00:06:07,260
 Yeah.

119
00:06:07,260 --> 00:06:08,260
 Stop living in my house.

120
00:06:08,260 --> 00:06:11,100
 What do you do with them if you don't have a house to attach to?

121
00:06:11,100 --> 00:06:14,220
 I think you just branched your mom that she's cold all the time and there's nothing she

122
00:06:14,220 --> 00:06:15,220
 can do about it.

123
00:06:15,220 --> 00:06:16,220
 Yeah.

124
00:06:16,220 --> 00:06:18,860
 I got some stuff on witnesses and oh yeah.

125
00:06:18,860 --> 00:06:26,520
 In Burma, or as it was, now my mom, in the old days you had to do an oath if you were in

126
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:27,520
 court.

127
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:28,520
 You probably still do.

128
00:06:28,520 --> 00:06:34,160
 But the old days it was 370 words long and it was like, I will speak the truth.

129
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:39,860
 If I speak not the truth, may it be that when I and my relations are on land, land animals,

130
00:06:39,860 --> 00:06:45,360
 such as tigers, elephants, buffaloes, poisonous serpents, scorpions, etc. shall seize, crush,

131
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:48,840
 and bite us so that we will certainly die.

132
00:06:48,840 --> 00:06:54,360
 Let the calamities occasioned by fire, water, rulers, thieves and enemies oppress and destroyers

133
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:57,280
 till we perish and come to utter destruction.

134
00:06:57,280 --> 00:07:02,760
 May we be seized with madness, dumbness, blindness, deafness, leprosy and rabies and may we be

135
00:07:02,760 --> 00:07:06,520
 struck with thunderbolts and lightning and come to a sudden death.

136
00:07:06,520 --> 00:07:07,520
 Wow.

137
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:10,560
 I mean, that's worse than swearing on a Bible.

138
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:11,560
 Yeah, really.

139
00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:18,040
 Well, they're more honest in the olden days because they really hit home how bad it was going

140
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:19,040
 to be if they weren't.

141
00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:20,040
 I think so.

142
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:21,040
 I mean, that's pretty bad.

143
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:24,120
 If you tell a lie and all that stuff happens to you and your family.

144
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:25,120
 Yeah.

145
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:26,440
 But then, I mean, it's very easy to refute.

146
00:07:26,440 --> 00:07:29,520
 As soon as one person hasn't had all of those things happen to them and you would have heard

147
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:33,800
 about it wherever you were if they did, then you go, well, this thing's obviously polyx.

148
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:38,200
 Yeah, but I guess what that means is that people always must have told the truth, right?

149
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:39,200
 Right.

150
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:40,200
 So in court, they always did.

151
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:41,200
 Yes.

152
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:45,960
 In the olden days where the Bible used to in Ireland, you'd have to kiss the Bible, but people

153
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:50,320
 would just slip their thumb in the way so they kiss their thumb instead of the Bible because

154
00:07:50,320 --> 00:07:53,680
 they were scared, obviously, if they kissed the Bible and told a lie that something bad would

155
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:54,680
 happen to them.

156
00:07:54,680 --> 00:07:56,960
 I still think something bad will happen to you.

157
00:07:56,960 --> 00:08:01,400
 I think something bad will happen if you believe in it and you also then get out of it

158
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:02,400
 by kissing your thumb.

159
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:03,400
 Do you think so?

160
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:04,400
 Yeah.

161
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:08,880
 But if you believe in something, you can make other rules up, right?

162
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:13,040
 Like if you have your fingers crossed behind your back, which is the pivotal scene in the

163
00:08:13,040 --> 00:08:14,440
 Truman show.

164
00:08:14,440 --> 00:08:19,440
 Like she didn't get married to Truman by crossing her fingers behind her back technically.

165
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:20,440
 That's what she believes.

166
00:08:20,440 --> 00:08:21,440
 Does that have legal basis?

167
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:25,560
 Well, he's a lawyer in that film, so he would know, and I think yes.

168
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:26,560
 Is he a lawyer?

169
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:27,560
 I think you're a lawyer.

170
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:28,560
 I think you're a lawyer.

171
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:29,560
 I think you're a lawyer.

172
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:30,560
 I do.

173
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:34,600
 Well, but in "Lia-Lia," he had his fingers crossed all the way through, so it shouldn't

174
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:35,600
 really be called "Lia-Lia."

175
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:36,600
 That's true.

176
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:46,800
 OK, it is time for fact number two, and that is my fact.

177
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:54,280
 My fact this week is that American pioneering explorers Lewis and Clark have been tracked via

178
00:08:54,280 --> 00:08:55,280
 their poo.

179
00:08:55,280 --> 00:08:56,280
 Mm.

180
00:08:56,280 --> 00:09:00,600
 I mean, we tracked them already via their extremely detailed journals.

181
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:07,800
 But what was that journal written in that?

182
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:09,400
 This is very interesting.

183
00:09:09,400 --> 00:09:14,760
 If by chance you don't happen to know who Lewis and Clark are, they were explorers who

184
00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:20,000
 in 1804 were trying to find a source from the Missouri River to the Pacific, so they went

185
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,000
 on this big track.

186
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:28,280
 It was a 28-month-long track, and along the way, it's a historic track in America, and they

187
00:09:28,280 --> 00:09:32,320
 know many of the spots that they went to, but they don't know exact locations, and they've

188
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:34,800
 always wanted to find out exact locations.

189
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:39,680
 Many people have gone out and seen where trees have been chopped down, where all bits of camp

190
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:40,680
 have been left.

191
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:44,360
 But many people have explored since then, and so there's no identifiable way of saying

192
00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:47,600
 for sure that that is Lewis and Clark, some 200 years ago.

193
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:51,960
 So what they have realized, though, is that Lewis and Clark, when they went on this expedition,

194
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:57,360
 their whole team was taking this special little pill called Kalamel, which was used to treat

195
00:09:57,360 --> 00:09:59,560
 syphilis, but also constipation.

196
00:09:59,560 --> 00:10:03,360
 Because while they were out on these missions, they were eating such raw, weird food.

197
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:08,120
 They needed to blitz their body of all this stuff in one foul swoop, and so they used

198
00:10:08,120 --> 00:10:09,120
 these.

199
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:13,160
 And they would take a day to sort of dig a latrine and the entire camp would go into there.

200
00:10:13,160 --> 00:10:14,160
 To dig a latrine?

201
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:15,160
 Yeah.

202
00:10:15,160 --> 00:10:16,160
 They wanted to come 28 months.

203
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:17,160
 They'd probably need to get toilet.

204
00:10:17,160 --> 00:10:19,680
 I like the way you said, I don't know if you actually said this, but it sounded like

205
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:21,160
 you said one foul swoop.

206
00:10:21,160 --> 00:10:22,160
 It did, yeah.

207
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:23,160
 Yeah.

208
00:10:23,160 --> 00:10:31,920
 That was the pun that I definitely was making, so yeah, thanks for picking that up.

209
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:38,080
 But I'm missing the main point of this fact, which is inside this pill was mercury.

210
00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:42,120
 And it was mercury that was flushing them out, and mercury doesn't degrade.

211
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:45,800
 So what they've been doing is going along the tracks and looking for high levels of mercury

212
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:50,200
 in the ground of these latrines, and they've been finding them, and now they know the exact

213
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:54,520
 locations of where they were pit-stopping along the way, some 200 years later.

214
00:10:54,520 --> 00:10:56,920
 Their poo mercury is still sitting there in the ground.

215
00:10:56,920 --> 00:10:57,920
 So cool.

216
00:10:57,920 --> 00:10:58,920
 Yeah.

217
00:10:58,920 --> 00:11:01,840
 Is that the trace you want to leave on earth, of yourself?

218
00:11:01,840 --> 00:11:03,480
 It's not the only trace they've left.

219
00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:07,440
 As you say, they'd have to credibly detail heroic textbooks and stories and things.

220
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:10,640
 But syphilis was a massive problem on that trip, wasn't it?

221
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:14,880
 Because in fact, STDs, generally, because it was Lewis and Clark, and then they had this

222
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:17,960
 big expedition of people with them, and there was loads of shagging.

223
00:11:17,960 --> 00:11:24,200
 So all the men except Lewis slept with lots of the Native Americans that they found,

224
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:25,720
 loads of the tribal women.

225
00:11:25,720 --> 00:11:32,040
 And so there was a lot of exchange of STDs, and syphilis came to Europeans from Native Americans,

226
00:11:32,040 --> 00:11:37,880
 and then I'm sure we, in return, gave Native Americans smallpox, smallpox, yeah, and hundreds

227
00:11:37,880 --> 00:11:38,880
 of other things.

228
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:41,600
 How do we know that Lewis didn't sleep with anyone?

229
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:45,280
 Because the other people who were on the expedition commented on the fact that he was really

230
00:11:45,280 --> 00:11:46,680
 like a bit.

231
00:11:46,680 --> 00:11:49,520
 He left extremely detailed reports of not having sex with him.

232
00:11:49,520 --> 00:11:50,520
 Yeah.

233
00:11:50,520 --> 00:11:51,520
 That's what I was going to say.

234
00:11:51,520 --> 00:11:53,280
 It sounds like he was in charge of the diary.

235
00:11:53,280 --> 00:11:54,280
 I think...

236
00:11:54,280 --> 00:11:55,280
 Do your wife.

237
00:11:55,280 --> 00:11:57,920
 Everyone but me.

238
00:11:57,920 --> 00:12:04,040
 Well, these pills were called thunder clappers, because they were so big and so violent in

239
00:12:04,040 --> 00:12:05,720
 the effects they produced on your stomach.

240
00:12:05,720 --> 00:12:06,720
 Yeah.

241
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:11,520
 Their official name was Dr. Russia's Billious Pills, but they were known as thunder clappers.

242
00:12:11,520 --> 00:12:12,520
 And they were big.

243
00:12:12,520 --> 00:12:15,840
 They were like four times bigger than a normal pill that you might take an aspirin or

244
00:12:15,840 --> 00:12:16,840
 anything like that.

245
00:12:16,840 --> 00:12:17,840
 Wow.

246
00:12:17,840 --> 00:12:22,760
 You guess you just break it in four and then you're okay, but even so, that would look frightening.

247
00:12:22,760 --> 00:12:23,760
 Yeah.

248
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:24,760
 Coming at you.

249
00:12:24,760 --> 00:12:28,880
 But it was weird, because they were sent off by Jefferson, weren't they?

250
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:29,880
 Yes.

251
00:12:29,880 --> 00:12:30,880
 He was behind it.

252
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:33,680
 And he thought they were going to find enormous woolly mammoths instead.

253
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:34,680
 Yeah, he did.

254
00:12:34,680 --> 00:12:35,680
 And giant sloths.

255
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:38,000
 Effectively, they were on a big-foot hunt.

256
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,240
 They were looking for cryptids.

257
00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:40,240
 They were looking for mythical...

258
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:42,080
 Well, they were looking for the Pacific.

259
00:12:42,080 --> 00:12:43,080
 Yeah.

260
00:12:43,080 --> 00:12:44,080
 Were they?

261
00:12:44,080 --> 00:12:45,960
 It sounds like they were looking for woolly mammoths.

262
00:12:45,960 --> 00:12:49,040
 He said you might find some woolly mammoths on your way to the Pacific.

263
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:50,800
 And if you do, please make nose.

264
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:53,840
 And he said there was another theory that Jefferson had.

265
00:12:53,840 --> 00:12:56,880
 They might meet a race of Welsh-speaking Native Americans.

266
00:12:56,880 --> 00:12:57,880
 Oh, yes.

267
00:12:57,880 --> 00:12:58,880
 They did not.

268
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:01,840
 But they did meet some Native Americans who could swear in English, because they'd met

269
00:13:01,840 --> 00:13:02,840
 traders.

270
00:13:02,840 --> 00:13:03,840
 Yeah.

271
00:13:03,840 --> 00:13:05,320
 One of them ran up and just said, "Son of a bitch."

272
00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:06,320
 Yeah.

273
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:07,320
 To be really.

274
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:08,320
 Yeah.

275
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:10,320
 That was how they knew they were close to the Pacific, in fact, wasn't it?

276
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:11,320
 Oh, really?

277
00:13:11,320 --> 00:13:14,800
 Really worried they were so lost, America was much bigger than they'd realised, and they

278
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:16,160
 weren't getting to the Pacific.

279
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:20,360
 And then suddenly, they started noticing that the tribe's people, who up until that point

280
00:13:20,360 --> 00:13:25,040
 had never seen a white person before, were suddenly wearing, kind of, British sailors' outfits

281
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:26,320
 and, like, sailing hats.

282
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:30,840
 And yeah, all the phrases they knew were, yeah, "Son of a bitch" and all me artis and

283
00:13:30,840 --> 00:13:34,160
 musket and downed rascal and stuff like that.

284
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:38,640
 And selling t-shirts that said, "My dad went to the Pacific, no, that's not a silly t-shirt."

285
00:13:38,640 --> 00:13:39,640
 Exactly.

286
00:13:39,640 --> 00:13:43,560
 Because that's obviously the only way that they could have come across any white people.

287
00:13:43,560 --> 00:13:44,560
 Yeah.

288
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:47,800
 Also, they were basically covered in mosquitos all the time.

289
00:13:47,800 --> 00:13:52,240
 The Mosquito clouds were so thick around them that all their meals, they had to eat over

290
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:54,920
 the smoke of a fire, because obviously mosquitos don't really like that.

291
00:13:54,920 --> 00:13:59,040
 And even then, as they were eating their meat, dozens of mosquitos got in the way, as they

292
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:00,040
 took huge bite.

293
00:14:00,040 --> 00:14:01,040
 Oh, my God.

294
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:02,600
 So they were constantly eating mosquitos.

295
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:07,800
 And Lewis spent a third of his budget on anti-mosquito devices and other things like

296
00:14:07,800 --> 00:14:08,800
 that.

297
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:09,800
 And they said, "Oh, look at that."

298
00:14:09,800 --> 00:14:10,800
 They said, "Oh, look at that."

299
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:11,800
 They said, "Oh, look at that."

300
00:14:11,800 --> 00:14:12,800
 They said, "Oh, look at that."

301
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:13,800
 They said, "Oh, look at that."

302
00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:14,800
 They said, "Oh, look at that."

303
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:15,800
 They said, "Oh, look at that."

304
00:14:15,800 --> 00:14:16,800
 And they said, "Oh, look at that."

305
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:17,800
 They said, "Oh, look at that."

306
00:14:17,800 --> 00:14:18,800
 They said, "Oh, look at that."

307
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:19,800
 They said, "Oh, look at that."

308
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:20,800
 They said, "Oh, look at that."

309
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:21,800
 They said, "Oh, look at that."

310
00:14:21,800 --> 00:14:22,800
 They said, "Oh, look at that."

311
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:23,800
 They said, "Oh, look at that."

312
00:14:23,800 --> 00:14:24,800
 They said, "Oh, look at that."

313
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:25,800
 They said, "Oh, look at that."

314
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:26,800
 They said, "Oh, look at that."

315
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:38,800
 They said, "Oh, look at that."

316
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:39,800
 They said, "Oh, look at that."

317
00:14:39,800 --> 00:14:40,800
 They said, "Oh, look at that."

318
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:41,800
 They said, "Oh, look at that."

319
00:14:41,800 --> 00:14:42,800
 They said, "Oh, look at that."

320
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:43,800
 They said, "Oh, look at that."

321
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:44,800
 They said, "Oh, look at that."

322
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:45,800
 They said, "Oh, look at that."

323
00:14:45,800 --> 00:14:46,800
 They said, "Oh, look at that."

324
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:47,800
 They said, "Oh, look at that."

325
00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:48,800
 They said, "Oh, look at that."

326
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:49,800
 They said, "Oh, look at that."

327
00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:50,800
 They said, "Oh, look at that."

328
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:51,800
 They said, "Oh, look at that."

329
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:52,800
 They said, "Oh, look at that."

330
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:53,800
 They said, "Oh, look at that."

331
00:14:53,800 --> 00:14:54,800
 They said, "Oh, look at that."

332
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:55,800
 They said, "Oh, look at that."

333
00:14:55,800 --> 00:14:56,800
 They said, "Oh, look at that."

334
00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:57,800
 They said, "Oh, look at that."

335
00:14:57,800 --> 00:14:58,800
 They said, "Oh, look at that."

336
00:14:58,800 --> 00:14:59,800
 They said, "Oh, look at that."

337
00:14:59,800 --> 00:15:00,800
 They said, "Oh, look at that."

338
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:01,800
 They said, "Oh, look at that."

339
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:02,800
 They said, "Oh, look at that."

340
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:03,800
 They said, "Oh, look at that."

341
00:15:03,800 --> 00:15:04,800
 They said, "Oh, look at that."

342
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:05,800
 They said, "Oh, look at that."

343
00:15:05,800 --> 00:15:06,800
 They said, "Oh, look at that."

344
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:07,800
 They said, "Oh, look at that."

345
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:08,800
 They said, "Oh, look at that."

346
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:09,800
 They said, "Oh, look at that."

347
00:15:09,800 --> 00:15:10,800
 They said, "Oh, look at that."

348
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:11,800
 They said, "Oh, look at that."

349
00:15:11,800 --> 00:15:12,800
 They said, "Oh, look at that."

350
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:13,800
 They said, "Oh, look at that."

351
00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:28,800
 They said, "Oh, look at that."

352
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:29,800
 They said, "Oh, look at that."

353
00:15:29,800 --> 00:15:30,800
 They said, "Oh, look at that."

354
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:31,800
 They said, "Oh, look at that."

355
00:15:31,800 --> 00:15:32,800
 They said, "Oh, look at that."

356
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:33,800
 They said, "Oh, look at that."

357
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:34,800
 They said, "Oh, look at that."

358
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:35,800
 They said, "Oh, look at that."

359
00:15:35,800 --> 00:15:36,800
 They said, "Oh, look at that."

360
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:37,800
 They said, "Oh, look at that."

361
00:15:37,800 --> 00:15:38,800
 They said, "Oh, look at that."

362
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:39,800
 They said, "Oh, look at that."

363
00:15:39,800 --> 00:15:40,800
 They said, "Oh, look at that."

364
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:41,800
 They said, "Oh, look at that."

365
00:15:41,800 --> 00:15:42,800
 They said, "Oh, look at that."

366
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:45,800
 Dear wife, we've definitely only even one dog.

367
00:15:45,800 --> 00:15:49,800
 Oh, just remember, they also dogs accept the one dog

368
00:15:49,800 --> 00:15:51,800
 that there was their Labrador companion along the way.

369
00:15:51,800 --> 00:15:53,800
 Okay, so they brought 200 and one dog.

370
00:15:53,800 --> 00:15:56,800
 It's a different story, isn't it?

371
00:15:56,800 --> 00:15:58,800
 201 Domations.

372
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:03,800
 Louis got a shot on the expedition by one of his own men,

373
00:16:03,800 --> 00:16:05,800
 and it was because they were our elk hunting,

374
00:16:05,800 --> 00:16:07,800
 and he was out hunting with his mate,

375
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:10,800
 who was blind in one eye and very short-sighted in the other,

376
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:12,800
 and mistook him for an elk.

377
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:15,800
 And so he fired a musket shot straight through his buttock,

378
00:16:15,800 --> 00:16:18,800
 and so he couldn't sit down with the rest of the trip.

379
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:20,800
 Apparently, he had to spend the rest of the expedition

380
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:21,800
 lying face down in the boat,

381
00:16:21,800 --> 00:16:23,800
 because he couldn't let his ass touch the ground.

382
00:16:23,800 --> 00:16:27,800
 You have to be very short-sighted to mistake a man for an elk.

383
00:16:27,800 --> 00:16:29,800
 You do, yeah, yeah.

384
00:16:29,800 --> 00:16:30,800
 It's true.

385
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:35,800
 But they wore sort of skins and stuff, animal skins.

386
00:16:35,800 --> 00:16:37,800
 So he was dressed as an elk?

387
00:16:37,800 --> 00:16:38,800
 He was dressed up as an elk.

388
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:40,800
 Maybe he saw an elk and shouted elk,

389
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:42,800
 and the guy who shot him thought he was an elk.

390
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:43,800
 Who knew his own name.

391
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:44,800
 Yeah.

392
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:47,800
 [laughter]

393
00:16:47,800 --> 00:16:49,800
 I have some stuff on laxatives.

394
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:50,800
 Oh, right.

395
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:51,800
 Cool.

396
00:16:51,800 --> 00:16:53,800
 Do you know in Bingo, they say,

397
00:16:53,800 --> 00:16:54,800
 "Doctor's Orders?"

398
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:55,800
 Number nine.

399
00:16:55,800 --> 00:16:56,800
 I do know that.

400
00:16:56,800 --> 00:16:57,800
 You know that, Adam.

401
00:16:57,800 --> 00:16:58,800
 Yeah.

402
00:16:58,800 --> 00:16:59,800
 She's a Bingo.

403
00:16:59,800 --> 00:17:00,800
 Huge Bingo fan.

404
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:02,800
 That's because during World War II,

405
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:05,800
 number nine was the name of a laxative handed out by medics.

406
00:17:05,800 --> 00:17:06,800
 Really?

407
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:07,800
 Which I didn't know.

408
00:17:07,800 --> 00:17:12,800
 And did you know ketchup was originally sold in pill form?

409
00:17:12,800 --> 00:17:14,800
 And they thought it would cure illnesses,

410
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:17,800
 such as diarrhea, jaundice, and indigestion.

411
00:17:17,800 --> 00:17:20,800
 But actually, they ended up fraudulently making them,

412
00:17:20,800 --> 00:17:22,800
 and instead of putting tomato in them,

413
00:17:22,800 --> 00:17:23,800
 tomato extract in them,

414
00:17:23,800 --> 00:17:26,800
 they just put laxatives in them.

415
00:17:26,800 --> 00:17:27,800
 So basically...

416
00:17:27,800 --> 00:17:29,800
 So it wasn't actually curing?

417
00:17:29,800 --> 00:17:32,800
 No, it was just making people shit themselves.

418
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:34,800
 And for people who are already suffering from diarrhea,

419
00:17:34,800 --> 00:17:35,800
 that must have been...

420
00:17:35,800 --> 00:17:36,800
 Oh, God.

421
00:17:36,800 --> 00:17:37,800
 Cool.

422
00:17:37,800 --> 00:17:39,800
 So this wasn't ketchup as a food supplement.

423
00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:40,800
 No.

424
00:17:40,800 --> 00:17:41,800
 You wouldn't have your chips,

425
00:17:41,800 --> 00:17:44,800
 and then you'd have the chips on the pill with ketchup.

426
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:46,800
 No, it was in the old days when they had these things

427
00:17:46,800 --> 00:17:47,800
 called patent medicines.

428
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:48,800
 Okay.

429
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:50,800
 You know, things like Seven Up used to be one of those

430
00:17:50,800 --> 00:17:51,800
 Coca-Cola kind of was one as well.

431
00:17:51,800 --> 00:17:52,800
 Right.

432
00:17:52,800 --> 00:17:53,800
 And Dr. Pepper, all these things were...

433
00:17:53,800 --> 00:17:55,800
 And ketchup pills were one of these things

434
00:17:55,800 --> 00:17:58,800
 that people used to take for just the general illnesses.

435
00:17:58,800 --> 00:17:59,800
 Wow.

436
00:17:59,800 --> 00:18:00,800
 Yeah.

437
00:18:00,800 --> 00:18:01,800
 That's so cool.

438
00:18:01,800 --> 00:18:02,800
 And according to Herodotus,

439
00:18:02,800 --> 00:18:07,800
 Egyptians used to spend three days in every month,

440
00:18:07,800 --> 00:18:10,800
 three successive days in every month taking laxatives.

441
00:18:10,800 --> 00:18:11,800
 No.

442
00:18:11,800 --> 00:18:13,800
 That's what Herodotus says.

443
00:18:13,800 --> 00:18:14,800
 Oh, Herodotus.

444
00:18:14,800 --> 00:18:16,800
 Wasn't either bloke who said there were ants,

445
00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:17,800
 the size of foxes.

446
00:18:17,800 --> 00:18:19,800
 Yeah, he couldn't have been right about everything.

447
00:18:19,800 --> 00:18:21,800
 Yeah, I reckon about this one.

448
00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:23,800
 But they kind of make sense,

449
00:18:23,800 --> 00:18:25,800
 because they'd feel like they're flushing you out,

450
00:18:25,800 --> 00:18:26,800
 which actually we've learned is not a good thing.

451
00:18:26,800 --> 00:18:28,800
 It just means it's just another way of saying it massively

452
00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:29,800
 dehydrates you.

453
00:18:29,800 --> 00:18:31,800
 But you can imagine in the olden days they would have thought

454
00:18:31,800 --> 00:18:33,800
 this looks like bad stuff that's coming out.

455
00:18:33,800 --> 00:18:34,800
 That's good.

456
00:18:34,800 --> 00:18:35,800
 Yeah, yeah, definitely.

457
00:18:35,800 --> 00:18:38,800
 They used to be reusable laxatives.

458
00:18:38,800 --> 00:18:42,800
 So one of the most popular laxatives was called antimony,

459
00:18:42,800 --> 00:18:44,800
 which is a chemical element.

460
00:18:44,800 --> 00:18:47,800
 And it worked, and it was used from the 1700s.

461
00:18:47,800 --> 00:18:49,800
 And it's been used for loads of stuff.

462
00:18:49,800 --> 00:18:51,800
 So I think the Egyptians used it as eyeliner.

463
00:18:51,800 --> 00:18:53,800
 But yeah, it became a really popular laxative.

464
00:18:53,800 --> 00:18:55,800
 Not after it's been used as a laxative.

465
00:18:55,800 --> 00:18:56,800
 Well, I don't know.

466
00:18:56,800 --> 00:18:57,800
 You know, they had...

467
00:18:57,800 --> 00:18:59,800
 You can wash it off, rinse it in the nail.

468
00:18:59,800 --> 00:19:00,800
 Yeah.

469
00:19:00,800 --> 00:19:04,800
 But the good thing about this is that it would stay completely

470
00:19:04,800 --> 00:19:05,800
 intact through your system.

471
00:19:05,800 --> 00:19:07,800
 So it totally flushes out your system,

472
00:19:07,800 --> 00:19:09,800
 then comes out on your poo, and then you pick it out

473
00:19:09,800 --> 00:19:10,800
 and reuse it later.

474
00:19:10,800 --> 00:19:11,800
 Wow.

475
00:19:11,800 --> 00:19:14,800
 And apparently, according to the source I was reading,

476
00:19:14,800 --> 00:19:16,800
 which was from a university somewhere,

477
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:20,800
 it said, "Some lucky families pass down antimony laxatives

478
00:19:20,800 --> 00:19:22,800
 from one generation to the next."

479
00:19:22,800 --> 00:19:24,800
 To my wife, I leave the house, to my son.

480
00:19:24,800 --> 00:19:27,800
 I leave the windows, and to my other son.

481
00:19:27,800 --> 00:19:31,800
 I leave my well-used laxative.

482
00:19:31,800 --> 00:19:41,800
 All right, it is time for fact number three.

483
00:19:41,800 --> 00:19:43,800
 And that is Annan.

484
00:19:43,800 --> 00:19:46,800
 My fact this week is that the author's Thomas Hardy,

485
00:19:46,800 --> 00:19:50,800
 Roger Kipling, and Joseph Conrad have all written books

486
00:19:50,800 --> 00:19:52,800
 the size of postage stamps.

487
00:19:52,800 --> 00:19:54,800
 This was for Queen Mary's Dolls House,

488
00:19:54,800 --> 00:19:57,800
 which is just so cool.

489
00:19:57,800 --> 00:19:58,800
 And if you haven't seen it, you should.

490
00:19:58,800 --> 00:19:59,800
 It's a Windsor Castle now.

491
00:19:59,800 --> 00:20:02,800
 But it was commissioned in the 1920s,

492
00:20:02,800 --> 00:20:04,800
 and it was finished in 1924.

493
00:20:04,800 --> 00:20:06,800
 And it was built for Queen Mary,

494
00:20:06,800 --> 00:20:09,800
 who was the wife of George V.

495
00:20:09,800 --> 00:20:12,800
 And the idea was her cousin's idea.

496
00:20:12,800 --> 00:20:14,800
 And her cousin, Princess Mary Louise,

497
00:20:14,800 --> 00:20:19,800
 contacted 171 authors to write miniature books for it.

498
00:20:19,800 --> 00:20:22,800
 So authors who did write books for it were J.M. Barry,

499
00:20:22,800 --> 00:20:25,800
 Chesterton, Conan Doyle, Robert Graves,

500
00:20:25,800 --> 00:20:28,800
 Huxley, A.A. Milne, E. Dithwater.

501
00:20:28,800 --> 00:20:30,800
 It was every big writer of the time,

502
00:20:30,800 --> 00:20:32,800
 wrote a small original novel for it.

503
00:20:32,800 --> 00:20:34,800
 And they were about the size of a stamp,

504
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:36,800
 about three centimeters by one centimeter.

505
00:20:36,800 --> 00:20:39,800
 And the only refusal was from George Bernard Shaw, I think.

506
00:20:39,800 --> 00:20:40,800
 I think there were a few refusals.

507
00:20:40,800 --> 00:20:42,800
 I think Virginia Woolf refused as well.

508
00:20:42,800 --> 00:20:44,800
 She wasn't asked, I don't think.

509
00:20:44,800 --> 00:20:47,800
 Oh, well, she's a counts differ.

510
00:20:47,800 --> 00:20:48,800
 Yeah.

511
00:20:48,800 --> 00:20:49,800
 Well, no, I don't believe it.

512
00:20:49,800 --> 00:20:50,800
 I thought she wasn't asked.

513
00:20:50,800 --> 00:20:54,800
 She was actually, so she, her girlfriend at the time,

514
00:20:54,800 --> 00:20:56,800
 or lover, was Vita Sackville West,

515
00:20:56,800 --> 00:20:58,800
 who was us and who did write something.

516
00:20:58,800 --> 00:21:01,800
 And the way I found out about this is that they're just publishing

517
00:21:01,800 --> 00:21:04,800
 the thing that she wrote for the first time in full size.

518
00:21:04,800 --> 00:21:08,800
 And they've realised that the novel that she wrote for this doll's house

519
00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:10,800
 is basically exactly the same as Orlando,

520
00:21:10,800 --> 00:21:14,800
 which was Virginia Woolf's most, well, one of her most famous novels.

521
00:21:14,800 --> 00:21:17,800
 And which Virginia Woolf said she was inspired to write Orlando

522
00:21:17,800 --> 00:21:20,800
 by Vita Sackville West, but we've only just realised,

523
00:21:20,800 --> 00:21:22,800
 she literally was inspired by this idea that Vita had.

524
00:21:22,800 --> 00:21:23,800
 Well, so hang on.

525
00:21:23,800 --> 00:21:26,800
 Did she, Virginia Woolf, plagiarise an existing novel,

526
00:21:26,800 --> 00:21:28,800
 but we just didn't know about it because it's too tiny?

527
00:21:28,800 --> 00:21:31,800
 It's the same general idea as this nymphlike person

528
00:21:31,800 --> 00:21:34,800
 who travels through lots of fairy tale landscapes, discovering stuff.

529
00:21:34,800 --> 00:21:37,800
 But it's most definitely, they were very, very in love.

530
00:21:37,800 --> 00:21:41,800
 And Orlando is like this whole love letter to Virginia Woolf's lover.

531
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:43,800
 And so she was open that she was inspired by her.

532
00:21:43,800 --> 00:21:44,800
 Why?

533
00:21:44,800 --> 00:21:45,800
 But yeah, it turns out this book is legit.

534
00:21:45,800 --> 00:21:47,800
 Imagine, have we read all the other books just to find out

535
00:21:47,800 --> 00:21:50,800
 if there are any other great books that we don't know about?

536
00:21:50,800 --> 00:21:52,800
 No, I mean, they do have to be quite short.

537
00:21:52,800 --> 00:21:53,800
 Yeah.

538
00:21:53,800 --> 00:21:54,800
 How long are they? They're about 30 words.

539
00:21:54,800 --> 00:21:56,800
 Because I could come up with, you know, nymphlike reach

540
00:21:56,800 --> 00:21:57,800
 travels through fantastical worlds.

541
00:21:57,800 --> 00:21:59,800
 That's half the words right there, isn't it?

542
00:21:59,800 --> 00:22:00,800
 Yeah.

543
00:22:00,800 --> 00:22:02,800
 But if someone wrote another book off the back of that,

544
00:22:02,800 --> 00:22:03,800
 I wouldn't feel too hard done by.

545
00:22:03,800 --> 00:22:05,800
 Because they've really put the hours in.

546
00:22:05,800 --> 00:22:06,800
 Yeah.

547
00:22:06,800 --> 00:22:08,800
 Weirdly, they got about 20 words on a page,

548
00:22:08,800 --> 00:22:09,800
 which I think is really impressive.

549
00:22:09,800 --> 00:22:12,800
 They had to write in very small re- and undy

550
00:22:12,800 --> 00:22:14,800
 are going to write some still on here.

551
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:17,800
 I'm trying to come up with a box that's three by one centimeter.

552
00:22:17,800 --> 00:22:18,800
 One centimeter.

553
00:22:18,800 --> 00:22:19,800
 A pardon.

554
00:22:19,800 --> 00:22:22,800
 I think hers was 3.9 by 1.5 centimeters, maybe.

555
00:22:22,800 --> 00:22:23,800
 Yeah, see James is going to be.

556
00:22:23,800 --> 00:22:24,800
 I've just written once upon a time.

557
00:22:24,800 --> 00:22:25,800
 I know it's a bit of a hack opening,

558
00:22:25,800 --> 00:22:27,800
 but I've just written it anyway.

559
00:22:27,800 --> 00:22:29,800
 Do you know, I've written exactly the same opening.

560
00:22:29,800 --> 00:22:31,800
 That is a major isn't it?

561
00:22:31,800 --> 00:22:34,800
 You can see how the Orlando situation happens.

562
00:22:34,800 --> 00:22:36,800
 I mean, we are wildly in love with each other.

563
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:37,800
 Yeah, that's very true.

564
00:22:37,800 --> 00:22:38,800
 Yeah.

565
00:22:38,800 --> 00:22:41,800
 I think I'd be surprised if I could get 20 on there.

566
00:22:41,800 --> 00:22:43,800
 But maybe about 12.

567
00:22:43,800 --> 00:22:45,800
 I've seen photos and they do cram on a lot more.

568
00:22:45,800 --> 00:22:47,800
 In fact, they even cram detailed drawings.

569
00:22:47,800 --> 00:22:50,800
 A few have been reproduced already.

570
00:22:50,800 --> 00:22:53,800
 Back in 2012, there was an author's book

571
00:22:53,800 --> 00:22:55,800
 who was made a lower print.

572
00:22:55,800 --> 00:22:56,800
 Andy, you've doubled space jobs.

573
00:22:56,800 --> 00:22:57,800
 That's a problem there.

574
00:22:57,800 --> 00:22:58,800
 Yeah, it's funny.

575
00:22:58,800 --> 00:23:00,800
 What did you go for?

576
00:23:00,800 --> 00:23:02,800
 What did you go after once upon a time?

577
00:23:02,800 --> 00:23:04,800
 There was a tiny pony with a nice haircut,

578
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:06,800
 but then I've run out of ideas.

579
00:23:06,800 --> 00:23:08,800
 What have you got, James?

580
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:10,800
 Well, mine didn't have quite as nice a haircut.

581
00:23:10,800 --> 00:23:13,800
 But it's really a love letter to you, sir.

582
00:23:13,800 --> 00:23:14,800
 That's right.

583
00:23:14,800 --> 00:23:17,800
 This is an amazing adult house.

584
00:23:17,800 --> 00:23:18,800
 It's incredible.

585
00:23:18,800 --> 00:23:20,800
 It's all the stories about the rest of the house.

586
00:23:20,800 --> 00:23:23,800
 It was built by Edwin Lutjins.

587
00:23:23,800 --> 00:23:25,800
 Yeah, like the biggest architects,

588
00:23:25,800 --> 00:23:27,800
 probably of the 20th century in Britain.

589
00:23:27,800 --> 00:23:29,800
 And he spent half his time during the construction of this house

590
00:23:29,800 --> 00:23:31,800
 building the city of New Delhi,

591
00:23:31,800 --> 00:23:32,800
 which was 80 square miles.

592
00:23:32,800 --> 00:23:34,800
 And he spent the other half working on a single doll's house

593
00:23:34,800 --> 00:23:35,800
 which was five feet high.

594
00:23:35,800 --> 00:23:36,800
 That's mad.

595
00:23:36,800 --> 00:23:37,800
 Yeah.

596
00:23:37,800 --> 00:23:38,800
 So cool.

597
00:23:38,800 --> 00:23:40,800
 But it was cool, wasn't it?

598
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:42,800
 The toilets had working plumbing.

599
00:23:42,800 --> 00:23:43,800
 It had electricity.

600
00:23:43,800 --> 00:23:44,800
 It had lifts.

601
00:23:44,800 --> 00:23:45,800
 That worked.

602
00:23:45,800 --> 00:23:46,800
 The functional lifts.

603
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:47,800
 Yeah.

604
00:23:47,800 --> 00:23:49,800
 It had a cellar with 200 bottles of shuttle,

605
00:23:49,800 --> 00:23:51,800
 a feet 1875.

606
00:23:51,800 --> 00:23:52,800
 No.

607
00:23:52,800 --> 00:23:54,800
 It's so incredible.

608
00:23:54,800 --> 00:23:56,800
 So Dunhill, the cigarette manufacturer at the time,

609
00:23:56,800 --> 00:24:01,800
 he donated tiny cigarettes and cigars to the house.

610
00:24:01,800 --> 00:24:02,800
 You know, all these people basically

611
00:24:02,800 --> 00:24:04,800
 it was a huge national project.

612
00:24:04,800 --> 00:24:05,800
 Because it was going to be the centerpiece

613
00:24:05,800 --> 00:24:07,800
 of the British Empire Exhibition of Arts and Manufacturing.

614
00:24:07,800 --> 00:24:09,800
 It's a bit like the Millennium Dome.

615
00:24:09,800 --> 00:24:10,800
 It is.

616
00:24:10,800 --> 00:24:11,800
 Isn't it?

617
00:24:11,800 --> 00:24:12,800
 It really is.

618
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:13,800
 Yeah.

619
00:24:13,800 --> 00:24:14,800
 But it is a bit smaller than that.

620
00:24:14,800 --> 00:24:16,800
 But aside from that, it is the same.

621
00:24:16,800 --> 00:24:17,800
 Yeah.

622
00:24:17,800 --> 00:24:19,800
 But do you know the one thing that wasn't in it?

623
00:24:19,800 --> 00:24:20,800
 Any dolls?

624
00:24:20,800 --> 00:24:21,800
 Really?

625
00:24:21,800 --> 00:24:22,800
 Yeah.

626
00:24:22,800 --> 00:24:23,800
 There were no dolls in this doll house

627
00:24:23,800 --> 00:24:24,800
 because if you put them in,

628
00:24:24,800 --> 00:24:27,800
 it would grotesquely dispel the enchantment.

629
00:24:27,800 --> 00:24:28,800
 Wow.

630
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:30,800
 So is it really a doll's house?

631
00:24:30,800 --> 00:24:31,800
 Good call.

632
00:24:31,800 --> 00:24:32,800
 Yeah.

633
00:24:32,800 --> 00:24:33,800
 Yeah, it's just an uninhabited one.

634
00:24:33,800 --> 00:24:34,800
 It's just still on the market.

635
00:24:34,800 --> 00:24:35,800
 You're right.

636
00:24:35,800 --> 00:24:37,800
 A house doesn't stop being a house as soon as I leave for the day.

637
00:24:37,800 --> 00:24:38,800
 Yeah.

638
00:24:38,800 --> 00:24:40,800
 Because they're very solipsistic

639
00:24:40,800 --> 00:24:42,800
 wherever you look at the world.

640
00:24:42,800 --> 00:24:44,800
 I like the fact that it also contains,

641
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:45,800
 as part of its library,

642
00:24:45,800 --> 00:24:47,800
 a stamp album.

643
00:24:47,800 --> 00:24:48,800
 Yeah.

644
00:24:48,800 --> 00:24:51,800
 So the stamps are 1/12 the size of actual stamps.

645
00:24:51,800 --> 00:24:52,800
 So.

646
00:24:52,800 --> 00:24:54,800
 Whereas the books are the size of stamps.

647
00:24:54,800 --> 00:24:55,800
 By the way,

648
00:24:55,800 --> 00:24:57,800
 if you want to like see all of this stuff

649
00:24:57,800 --> 00:24:58,800
 and there's so much more,

650
00:24:58,800 --> 00:25:01,800
 really do go to the Royal Collection Trust website

651
00:25:01,800 --> 00:25:03,800
 because it just has every single item

652
00:25:03,800 --> 00:25:05,800
 called ISOM on the in-minute shirt descriptions

653
00:25:05,800 --> 00:25:06,800
 of where it's come from.

654
00:25:06,800 --> 00:25:07,800
 It's so great.

655
00:25:07,800 --> 00:25:08,800
 Or go to Windsor Castle.

656
00:25:08,800 --> 00:25:09,800
 Is it on view to the public?

657
00:25:09,800 --> 00:25:12,800
 Well, when I went, I saw it years ago when I was a kid, yeah.

658
00:25:12,800 --> 00:25:15,800
 The weird thing about this place is it was for Queen Mary

659
00:25:15,800 --> 00:25:17,800
 and she was an adult at the time.

660
00:25:17,800 --> 00:25:19,800
 It wasn't created for a child.

661
00:25:19,800 --> 00:25:22,800
 And dolls houses weren't originally for children.

662
00:25:22,800 --> 00:25:23,800
 Really?

663
00:25:23,800 --> 00:25:25,800
 Oh, there were markers of status.

664
00:25:25,800 --> 00:25:28,800
 So the first one was made for the Duke of Bavaria in 1557,

665
00:25:28,800 --> 00:25:30,800
 who was not a child.

666
00:25:30,800 --> 00:25:33,800
 And then later on, about a century or two later,

667
00:25:33,800 --> 00:25:35,800
 there were things called Nuremberg Kitchens.

668
00:25:35,800 --> 00:25:36,800
 And these were dolls houses, right?

669
00:25:36,800 --> 00:25:37,800
 And they had all kinds of stuff of them.

670
00:25:37,800 --> 00:25:39,800
 They were full of all the household items.

671
00:25:39,800 --> 00:25:42,800
 But they were designed to show young women

672
00:25:42,800 --> 00:25:44,800
 how to become the lady of the house.

673
00:25:44,800 --> 00:25:47,800
 So it was like that you know there's little military maps

674
00:25:47,800 --> 00:25:49,800
 that you push little tanks around and the soldiers.

675
00:25:49,800 --> 00:25:50,800
 Yeah.

676
00:25:50,800 --> 00:25:51,800
 Which is like a domestic version of that.

677
00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:53,800
 You say, right, this is how you run the house.

678
00:25:53,800 --> 00:25:55,800
 This is how you instruct the servants to move around it.

679
00:25:55,800 --> 00:25:58,800
 This is how you need to run things on a day-by-day basis.

680
00:25:58,800 --> 00:25:59,800
 Clean here.

681
00:25:59,800 --> 00:26:01,800
 That was so cool.

682
00:26:01,800 --> 00:26:03,800
 The purpose of the dolls house in the 17th century.

683
00:26:03,800 --> 00:26:04,800
 Amazing.

684
00:26:04,800 --> 00:26:06,800
 It's amazing that they thought that no one

685
00:26:06,800 --> 00:26:07,800
 would be able to work out a hut,

686
00:26:07,800 --> 00:26:09,800
 so if you live in a house,

687
00:26:09,800 --> 00:26:11,800
 it doesn't have to tell them how to do it.

688
00:26:11,800 --> 00:26:12,800
 I know.

689
00:26:12,800 --> 00:26:14,800
 Come on, our houses were way more complex.

690
00:26:14,800 --> 00:26:16,800
 If you were living down an abbey or something,

691
00:26:16,800 --> 00:26:18,800
 you had to know which scholarly you'd find which

692
00:26:18,800 --> 00:26:20,800
 made to deal with which pan.

693
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:22,800
 It was very complex.

694
00:26:22,800 --> 00:26:24,800
 You know the game, The Sims.

695
00:26:24,800 --> 00:26:25,800
 One of the biggest games of all time.

696
00:26:25,800 --> 00:26:26,800
 Love it, right?

697
00:26:26,800 --> 00:26:27,800
 Yeah, awesome game.

698
00:26:27,800 --> 00:26:29,800
 That started as a dolls house.

699
00:26:29,800 --> 00:26:30,800
 Really?

700
00:26:30,800 --> 00:26:31,800
 A real, a physical dolls house.

701
00:26:31,800 --> 00:26:32,800
 A virtual dolls house.

702
00:26:32,800 --> 00:26:34,800
 It still is a virtual dolls house.

703
00:26:34,800 --> 00:26:35,800
 Yeah, but so...

704
00:26:35,800 --> 00:26:37,800
 It started as a men to go on.

705
00:26:37,800 --> 00:26:43,800
 No, but this very interesting will write the creator of The Sims.

706
00:26:43,800 --> 00:26:46,800
 He created a virtual dolls house of his house,

707
00:26:46,800 --> 00:26:50,800
 which he lost during a firestorm in 1991.

708
00:26:50,800 --> 00:26:53,800
 And he was so upset about losing the memories of his house

709
00:26:53,800 --> 00:26:58,800
 that he created a virtual miniature version of his house on a computer

710
00:26:58,800 --> 00:27:01,800
 where he just literally replicated all the rooms

711
00:27:01,800 --> 00:27:03,800
 so he could have a memory of what he once had.

712
00:27:03,800 --> 00:27:04,800
 Hey.

713
00:27:04,800 --> 00:27:06,800
 Yeah, and then he saw that and thought, actually, this...

714
00:27:06,800 --> 00:27:07,800
 This might be something big.

715
00:27:07,800 --> 00:27:10,800
 And he pitched it to the people who made Sims City

716
00:27:10,800 --> 00:27:12,800
 and that's how we got to it.

717
00:27:12,800 --> 00:27:14,800
 He called it his virtual dolls house.

718
00:27:14,800 --> 00:27:16,800
 And did people, whenever they asked him his name,

719
00:27:16,800 --> 00:27:17,800
 and he said, "Will write?"

720
00:27:17,800 --> 00:27:20,800
 Did they always say, "No, you can just tell us everything about it."

721
00:27:20,800 --> 00:27:23,800
 Some stuff on small books.

722
00:27:23,800 --> 00:27:24,800
 Yeah.

723
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:28,800
 And the smallest book, according to the Guinness Book of World Records,

724
00:27:28,800 --> 00:27:31,800
 is called Teeny Ted from Turnip Town.

725
00:27:31,800 --> 00:27:35,800
 And it was made in 2007 by Robert Chaplin.

726
00:27:35,800 --> 00:27:39,800
 And it's 0.07 millimeters by 0.1 millimeters.

727
00:27:39,800 --> 00:27:42,800
 And it tells a story of Teeny Ted's victory

728
00:27:42,800 --> 00:27:45,800
 in the Turnip contest at the annual County Fair.

729
00:27:45,800 --> 00:27:47,800
 Spoiler alert, sorry.

730
00:27:47,800 --> 00:27:50,800
 0.07 millimeters.

731
00:27:50,800 --> 00:27:52,800
 I mean, how is that even possible?

732
00:27:52,800 --> 00:27:53,800
 Well, it's just small.

733
00:27:53,800 --> 00:27:56,800
 It's carved into micro tablets

734
00:27:56,800 --> 00:28:00,800
 on a polished piece of single crystalline silicon

735
00:28:00,800 --> 00:28:03,800
 using a focused gallium iron beam.

736
00:28:03,800 --> 00:28:04,800
 And how...?

737
00:28:04,800 --> 00:28:06,800
 It kind of helps.

738
00:28:06,800 --> 00:28:09,800
 I don't know, science is involved.

739
00:28:09,800 --> 00:28:11,800
 How are we supposed to read it?

740
00:28:11,800 --> 00:28:13,800
 Well, I'll just tell you what happens.

741
00:28:13,800 --> 00:28:15,800
 Well, he did a Kickstarter project

742
00:28:15,800 --> 00:28:18,800
 or one of those crowdfunding projects.

743
00:28:18,800 --> 00:28:20,800
 And they've printed a large print edition.

744
00:28:20,800 --> 00:28:24,800
 But since then, a Russian guy called Vladimir Anitskin

745
00:28:24,800 --> 00:28:28,800
 has made a book which is 0.07 millimeters the same

746
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:31,800
 by 0.09 millimeters.

747
00:28:31,800 --> 00:28:34,800
 So it's 0.01 millimeters shorter.

748
00:28:34,800 --> 00:28:38,800
 And that is a story about a flea's shoes.

749
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:39,800
 Really?

750
00:28:39,800 --> 00:28:40,800
 Yeah.

751
00:28:40,800 --> 00:28:44,800
 And he plays the finished pages into half of a poppy seed.

752
00:28:44,800 --> 00:28:45,800
 Wow.

753
00:28:45,800 --> 00:28:47,800
 That's how small that is.

754
00:28:47,800 --> 00:28:50,800
 Because it would rattle around in a full poppy seed.

755
00:28:50,800 --> 00:28:53,800
 And the smallest book I think you can buy in Amazon.

756
00:28:53,800 --> 00:28:56,800
 Not the best book that you can buy in Amazon.

757
00:28:56,800 --> 00:28:58,800
 Are there other books available?

758
00:28:58,800 --> 00:29:02,800
 But the smallest book is called The Smallest Book in the World.

759
00:29:02,800 --> 00:29:05,800
 And it was from the first September 2001

760
00:29:05,800 --> 00:29:08,800
 and it measures 2.4 millimeters by 2.9 millimeters.

761
00:29:08,800 --> 00:29:13,800
 And there is one used copy for 700 pounds.

762
00:29:13,800 --> 00:29:15,800
 That's so good.

763
00:29:15,800 --> 00:29:18,800
 Is the picture of it just unbelievably tiny

764
00:29:18,800 --> 00:29:20,800
 when you see the cover arc?

765
00:29:20,800 --> 00:29:22,800
 There is a little kind of picture.

766
00:29:22,800 --> 00:29:24,800
 And there's a picture of a matchstick next to it.

767
00:29:24,800 --> 00:29:26,800
 And then it says it's the size of this matchstick hat

768
00:29:26,800 --> 00:29:27,800
 and there's a tie.

769
00:29:27,800 --> 00:29:30,800
 Oh, the author signings must be an absolute bastard.

770
00:29:30,800 --> 00:29:33,800
 I'm afraid I'll need a gallium iron cannon.

771
00:29:41,800 --> 00:29:43,800
 OK, it is time for our final thanks to the show.

772
00:29:43,800 --> 00:29:45,800
 That is Andy.

773
00:29:45,800 --> 00:29:49,800
 My fact is that army ant nests are made of other army ants.

774
00:29:49,800 --> 00:29:52,800
 So this is like a doll's house made of dolls.

775
00:29:52,800 --> 00:29:54,800
 If I can blind you all with science.

776
00:29:54,800 --> 00:29:55,800
 Of course, human house made of humans.

777
00:29:55,800 --> 00:29:56,800
 Terrifying, exactly.

778
00:29:56,800 --> 00:29:57,800
 Yeah.

779
00:29:57,800 --> 00:30:01,800
 So they have these weird faces of living in one place.

780
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:03,800
 They live in one place while they love it growing.

781
00:30:03,800 --> 00:30:05,800
 And then they go on the road for a bit.

782
00:30:05,800 --> 00:30:06,800
 Like a band.

783
00:30:06,800 --> 00:30:08,800
 They talk to a different place every night.

784
00:30:08,800 --> 00:30:12,800
 Well, like a band that marches through a jungle eating everything in its path.

785
00:30:12,800 --> 00:30:13,800
 Yeah, exactly, yeah.

786
00:30:13,800 --> 00:30:15,800
 So like Erasmith, for example.

787
00:30:15,800 --> 00:30:18,800
 So they have these three week long roaming faces.

788
00:30:18,800 --> 00:30:21,800
 And during the roaming phase, every night they form a living colony

789
00:30:21,800 --> 00:30:25,800
 and a load of the ants link together and create a ball around the queen.

790
00:30:25,800 --> 00:30:27,800
 And it's got tunnels and it's got chambers,

791
00:30:27,800 --> 00:30:31,800
 but all the columns and pillars and walls are made of army ants.

792
00:30:31,800 --> 00:30:32,800
 That's so cool.

793
00:30:32,800 --> 00:30:33,800
 It's really weird.

794
00:30:33,800 --> 00:30:34,800
 So they're all alive.

795
00:30:34,800 --> 00:30:35,800
 They're all alive, yeah.

796
00:30:35,800 --> 00:30:40,800
 And they have hooks on their feet, which allow them to create these bivouacs as they get called.

797
00:30:40,800 --> 00:30:44,800
 I wonder, do they have, because ants are very specialised in their rules, aren't they?

798
00:30:44,800 --> 00:30:50,800
 But I wonder if they get to be different parts of the house, like summer sofa ants, summer shower ants.

799
00:30:50,800 --> 00:30:53,800
 And they're about a half a million in the colony.

800
00:30:53,800 --> 00:30:57,800
 And they launch these raiding parties, about 200,000, which just fan out and then march.

801
00:30:57,800 --> 00:30:59,800
 As you say, eating everything in their path.

802
00:30:59,800 --> 00:31:00,800
 Yeah.

803
00:31:00,800 --> 00:31:01,800
 Those guys are absolutely incredible.

804
00:31:01,800 --> 00:31:06,800
 There's like stories of them eating drunk people who've passed out in the middle of a jungle.

805
00:31:06,800 --> 00:31:09,800
 But I never found any evidence and that's actually true.

806
00:31:09,800 --> 00:31:13,800
 But they will eat stuff if, you know, if an animal's injured, they'll just go over it and eat it.

807
00:31:13,800 --> 00:31:15,800
 And they'll just be bones by the end of it.

808
00:31:15,800 --> 00:31:16,800
 Yeah.

809
00:31:16,800 --> 00:31:22,800
 There are apparently 557 associates to an army ant march,

810
00:31:22,800 --> 00:31:27,800
 by which I mean animals that kind of feed off them or are helped by them.

811
00:31:27,800 --> 00:31:34,800
 So you've got mites who live on the ants, you've got birds who eat any insects that are running away from the army ants.

812
00:31:34,800 --> 00:31:38,800
 You've got butterflies who follow them eating their droppings.

813
00:31:38,800 --> 00:31:43,800
 Yeah, more than 500 different species are following these ants around, living off them.

814
00:31:43,800 --> 00:31:49,800
 But there's actually a new species that's been found, that is one of these 500 I guess,

815
00:31:49,800 --> 00:31:52,800
 which is a new species of beetle that's been found in Costa Rica.

816
00:31:52,800 --> 00:31:59,800
 And it bites onto an army ants bum and pretends to be a second bum and hitches a ride.

817
00:31:59,800 --> 00:32:01,800
 And that's how it travels.

818
00:32:01,800 --> 00:32:05,800
 And so you look at this army ant and scientists look at this army ant and we've got two arses,

819
00:32:05,800 --> 00:32:06,800
 what a weird species of ant.

820
00:32:06,800 --> 00:32:10,800
 And it's actually just this guy who's got his teeth embedded in his bottom.

821
00:32:10,800 --> 00:32:14,800
 But surely it's not convincing to pretend to be a second bum.

822
00:32:14,800 --> 00:32:15,800
 Why not?

823
00:32:15,800 --> 00:32:17,800
 Because I don't know anyone who's got two bum.

824
00:32:17,800 --> 00:32:19,800
 You're not, I don't know.

825
00:32:19,800 --> 00:32:20,800
 No, I guess not.

826
00:32:20,800 --> 00:32:25,800
 And also ants, I suppose they can't really turn around and look at that own bum.

827
00:32:25,800 --> 00:32:26,800
 No.

828
00:32:26,800 --> 00:32:29,800
 So they're just going to think they've put on a bit of weight down there.

829
00:32:29,800 --> 00:32:30,800
 That's true.

830
00:32:30,800 --> 00:32:31,800
 And they're also really polite.

831
00:32:31,800 --> 00:32:33,800
 So if they say, "Does my bum look okay in this?"

832
00:32:33,800 --> 00:32:35,800
 They all just tell each other, "Yeah, that was great."

833
00:32:35,800 --> 00:32:36,800
 Which one?

834
00:32:36,800 --> 00:32:42,800
 Here's another weird thing that they do.

835
00:32:42,800 --> 00:32:43,800
 This is army ants.

836
00:32:43,800 --> 00:32:45,800
 Have you guys heard of an ant mill?

837
00:32:45,800 --> 00:32:46,800
 I've never heard of this before.

838
00:32:46,800 --> 00:32:47,800
 No.

839
00:32:47,800 --> 00:32:51,800
 This is when army ants are in a big group of army ants are going out.

840
00:32:51,800 --> 00:32:55,800
 And what it said is when they're blind.

841
00:32:55,800 --> 00:32:56,800
 So I don't know how--

842
00:32:56,800 --> 00:32:57,800
 They're all blind.

843
00:32:57,800 --> 00:32:58,800
 Ah, okay, right.

844
00:32:58,800 --> 00:32:59,800
 So they're all blind.

845
00:32:59,800 --> 00:33:00,800
 Thank you.

846
00:33:00,800 --> 00:33:01,800
 That makes so much sense of this now.

847
00:33:01,800 --> 00:33:03,800
 It's what is, they lose the pheromone track of where they're on.

848
00:33:03,800 --> 00:33:05,800
 So one of them leads them astray.

849
00:33:05,800 --> 00:33:06,800
 And they all head off.

850
00:33:06,800 --> 00:33:08,800
 And then suddenly they're lost as a pack.

851
00:33:08,800 --> 00:33:11,800
 But then what they start to do is follow one another.

852
00:33:11,800 --> 00:33:13,800
 And it eventually turns into a circle.

853
00:33:13,800 --> 00:33:17,800
 And they're just walk in a circle till they die of starvation.

854
00:33:17,800 --> 00:33:20,800
 Basically, it's just a continuous circle where they think they're walking back.

855
00:33:20,800 --> 00:33:23,800
 It's like being in a conga, but the back of the conga joins the front of the conga.

856
00:33:23,800 --> 00:33:24,800
 Yeah.

857
00:33:24,800 --> 00:33:25,800
 And you just conga until you all die.

858
00:33:25,800 --> 00:33:26,800
 Exactly.

859
00:33:26,800 --> 00:33:27,800
 It's a very sad way to go.

860
00:33:27,800 --> 00:33:28,800
 Do it, do it.

861
00:33:28,800 --> 00:33:31,800
 I mean, it's not a sad way to go.

862
00:33:31,800 --> 00:33:32,800
 Is it happiest?

863
00:33:32,800 --> 00:33:33,800
 Is that happiest that way?

864
00:33:33,800 --> 00:33:34,800
 I think I wouldn't want to go to that wedding.

865
00:33:34,800 --> 00:33:37,800
 People always say what's the best way of dying.

866
00:33:37,800 --> 00:33:41,800
 You know, like some people say there are some ways of dying where you have like euphoria

867
00:33:41,800 --> 00:33:43,800
 just before you die, isn't there?

868
00:33:43,800 --> 00:33:47,800
 You think the conga is the happiest way?

869
00:33:47,800 --> 00:33:48,800
 Well, it's quite happy.

870
00:33:48,800 --> 00:33:50,800
 Is it how you would want to go?

871
00:33:50,800 --> 00:33:52,800
 Absolutely.

872
00:33:52,800 --> 00:33:57,800
 Or death by, you know that one where you sit down on the dance floor and pretend you're rowing about.

873
00:33:57,800 --> 00:33:58,800
 Oh, that's a great move.

874
00:33:58,800 --> 00:34:00,800
 Maybe it oops up side your head.

875
00:34:00,800 --> 00:34:01,800
 Oh yeah.

876
00:34:01,800 --> 00:34:02,800
 That's a good way to go.

877
00:34:02,800 --> 00:34:04,800
 Because you're doing the conga thing, but you're also sat down.

878
00:34:04,800 --> 00:34:06,800
 So you're a bit more comfortable.

879
00:34:06,800 --> 00:34:07,800
 Yeah.

880
00:34:07,800 --> 00:34:09,800
 The aunts don't do that one, though.

881
00:34:09,800 --> 00:34:11,800
 And they don't have the music for the conga line.

882
00:34:11,800 --> 00:34:13,800
 I do think it's quite a bad way to go.

883
00:34:13,800 --> 00:34:15,800
 That's a real tragedy, actually.

884
00:34:15,800 --> 00:34:16,800
 Tragedy.

885
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:18,800
 Now that dance would be a good one.

886
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:19,800
 Yes.

887
00:34:19,800 --> 00:34:22,800
 Now aunts do sometimes make noises, though.

888
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:26,800
 Not music and not 90s pop hits, but they do make noises.

889
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:31,200
 You listen closely they're going, "Hey, macaro, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no."

890
00:34:31,200 --> 00:34:37,800
 There's an ant nest beetle which can speak three different dialects of ants depending on which nest it goes into.

891
00:34:37,800 --> 00:34:46,800
 So they do it by stridulation which means you're kind of rubbing one body part on the other, but they know three different dialects and they'll go into a nest and pretend to be that ant.

892
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:51,800
 But if they get the that accent slightly wrong, the other ants kill them and eat them.

893
00:34:51,800 --> 00:35:00,800
 So that's like kind of going to a bar and new castle and speaking with a jordy accent and they realise it's not a jordy accent and then they kill you and eat you.

894
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:06,800
 So actually, I mean it's a different language, it's like going to a bar in France and speaking with the wrong French accent, it's terrifying.

895
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:10,800
 Yeah, weirdly so that was a beetle that speaks these different accents, right?

896
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:18,800
 Yeah. So there are other beetles who have evolved to look like army ants so they can sneak in to the army ant nests.

897
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:28,800
 So they have developed a gland which can squirt a chemical at the ants and blast them out of the way so it allows them to make their escape if they're ever rumbled by the ants.

898
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:32,800
 But these beetles spend their whole lives living in the colony.

899
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:35,800
 You spend your whole life surrounded by a hostile species.

900
00:35:35,800 --> 00:35:43,800
 And it looks ridiculous, right, because they're blind so they don't know but to us when you see pictures of it, it's just like that's obviously not one of you guys.

901
00:35:43,800 --> 00:35:50,800
 I didn't realise they were blind, I just thought the answer was stupid, I didn't know that. But actually that explains why they couldn't see that they had two bumps.

902
00:35:50,800 --> 00:35:59,800
 Yeah, so that one little detail is real so much about the fact that it does my bum lock good in this, I don't know why I'm blind.

903
00:35:59,800 --> 00:36:06,800
 They do have, when they find meat, they transport it to what they call a booty cash so that kind of fits the bump thing.

904
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:09,800
 They don't call it that, no, that's a good point, yeah.

905
00:36:09,800 --> 00:36:18,800
 So something they can do with their bodies, which is really clever, is that they plug any holes in the ground or any obstacles and this speeds up their progress anywhere.

906
00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:28,800
 But they're really smart about it, so as they're going along in these big troops of hundreds of thousands of ants, they'll come across a little hole or a tiny little bump that maybe we couldn't even see.

907
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:34,800
 And they measure up their bodies as they go past to see which of them is the right size for the whole.

908
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:42,800
 And the right size and will play out over that hole and spend hours while the other ants just go back and forth over him if they're collecting or anything.

909
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:49,800
 And scientists have literally, they've drilled slightly different size holes in a plank of wood and they watch the ants go and they measure themselves up against the hole.

910
00:36:49,800 --> 00:36:52,800
 They're like not too big for that one, Barry, you're on this.

911
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:55,800
 And the different size ants go and then spend hours spread out over these holes.

912
00:36:55,800 --> 00:36:59,800
 It's a bit like lemmings, the game, isn't it? Do you remember that game?

913
00:36:59,800 --> 00:37:05,800
 And you would have holes and they all did different things to get you past those holes, but then everyone would just keep marching over you and stuff.

914
00:37:05,800 --> 00:37:06,800
 Really?

915
00:37:06,800 --> 00:37:07,800
 Just like that.

916
00:37:07,800 --> 00:37:08,800
 Yeah, maybe they'd based on that.

917
00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:10,800
 But do you think they like it?

918
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:13,800
 Or do you think they get to a hole and they go, "Oh, that's the same size as me."

919
00:37:13,800 --> 00:37:17,800
 Yeah, I think it's that. They try to, they sound tipters and go, "No, I'm definitely too tall for this one."

920
00:37:17,800 --> 00:37:18,800
 No.

921
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:22,800
 But they do, they do get, they're all blind.

922
00:37:24,800 --> 00:37:30,800
 But you can feel it. You can feel the size of a hole. So can I just say, not all army ants are blind.

923
00:37:30,800 --> 00:37:31,800
 Oh, not?

924
00:37:31,800 --> 00:37:35,800
 There are lots of different species of them and the ones that have the ant mills are blind.

925
00:37:35,800 --> 00:37:37,800
 But not all species are.

926
00:37:37,800 --> 00:37:41,800
 Is there sometimes a big hole that the beetle has to get into?

927
00:37:41,800 --> 00:37:43,800
 That's when he's gone blind.

928
00:37:43,800 --> 00:37:51,800
 It's very cool though, because if you're sitting in the hole,

929
00:37:51,800 --> 00:37:55,800
 you don't get to get any of the food that the ants find you, you don't get any prey.

930
00:37:55,800 --> 00:37:57,800
 But they save you some when you get home.

931
00:37:57,800 --> 00:37:58,800
 Come on.

932
00:37:58,800 --> 00:38:01,800
 They get a meal when they get back because for the work they've done for the colony.

933
00:38:01,800 --> 00:38:04,800
 That is the least they can do, I think.

934
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:09,800
 So some ant nests, these are not army ants now, but these are, this is a different species of ant.

935
00:38:09,800 --> 00:38:12,800
 It's actually called the hairy northern wood ant.

936
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:18,800
 Some of their ant nests have essentially listed building status in the UK.

937
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:22,800
 The British Forestry Commission have mapped and said these must be preserved.

938
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:26,800
 And it's a little skyscraper city of ant nests, up to two meters high,

939
00:38:26,800 --> 00:38:32,800
 made by ants, which is bigger relative to an ant than the Empire State Building is to a human.

940
00:38:32,800 --> 00:38:37,800
 Yeah, and they're all made of pine needles and there are 69 of them which have been found and plotted.

941
00:38:37,800 --> 00:38:42,800
 And they are basically preserved because the British Forestry Commission have said

942
00:38:42,800 --> 00:38:44,800
 you have to look after these.

943
00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:46,800
 So you can't build a conservatory on anything?

944
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:47,800
 No, you can't.

945
00:38:47,800 --> 00:38:48,800
 No.

946
00:38:48,800 --> 00:38:50,800
 But who's going to stop an ant if it was to make a conservatory?

947
00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:51,800
 That's true.

948
00:38:51,800 --> 00:38:53,800
 They're not going to get flat information.

949
00:38:53,800 --> 00:38:57,800
 But actually, conservatory would be really good for them because they need, no, it would.

950
00:38:57,800 --> 00:38:59,800
 Because they need heat, right?

951
00:38:59,800 --> 00:39:03,800
 And the way that the ants get heat is some of the work rats will go outside,

952
00:39:03,800 --> 00:39:08,800
 some days for a bit, soak up heat, and then quickly go back in and release the heat into the nest.

953
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:10,800
 And that's their method of warming up their nest.

954
00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:12,800
 So conservatory would be much better for them.

955
00:39:12,800 --> 00:39:13,800
 Yeah.

956
00:39:13,800 --> 00:39:18,800
 Well, and they're farmers, aren't they? A lot of ants are farmers, so conservatory would be great for growing their food.

957
00:39:18,800 --> 00:39:22,800
 There are a lot of ants that can't bite into seeds because their teeth aren't strong enough.

958
00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:23,800
 Their mandal's aren't strong enough.

959
00:39:23,800 --> 00:39:26,800
 And so instead, what they do is, which is a really long-witted way of getting a meal,

960
00:39:26,800 --> 00:39:29,800
 is that they plant the seeds, they fertilize them with their own feces,

961
00:39:29,800 --> 00:39:32,800
 they wait for them to grow germinate and split for the huster split,

962
00:39:32,800 --> 00:39:34,800
 and then they can eat the stuff inside.

963
00:39:34,800 --> 00:39:35,800
 Wow.

964
00:39:35,800 --> 00:39:37,800
 Which is quite a long time to wait if you're really hungry.

965
00:39:37,800 --> 00:39:38,800
 Others, yeah.

966
00:39:38,800 --> 00:39:40,800
 You've got to plan your dinner parties well in order.

967
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:45,800
 And did you guys know that ants' mandal bills used to be used, and still are used,

968
00:39:45,800 --> 00:39:48,800
 I think, in bits of East Africa, to stitch up wounds.

969
00:39:48,800 --> 00:39:53,800
 They get an ant, and the mandal bills are just the right size of certain ants to heal up a wound,

970
00:39:53,800 --> 00:39:59,800
 and then they make an ant bite into the sides of a wound, of a cut,

971
00:39:59,800 --> 00:40:02,800
 and then the sort of little teeth will pull the skin together,

972
00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:07,800
 and then they cut the ants body away, and the teeth just sit there healing up the wound.

973
00:40:07,800 --> 00:40:10,800
 So they decapitate the ant once it's acted as a stitch.

974
00:40:10,800 --> 00:40:13,800
 It's actually more like deboditating than I think.

975
00:40:13,800 --> 00:40:15,800
 Because you're traveling the body off of it.

976
00:40:15,800 --> 00:40:17,800
 The effect is much the same.

977
00:40:17,800 --> 00:40:18,800
 Yeah.

978
00:40:18,800 --> 00:40:19,800
 That's just semantics.

979
00:40:19,800 --> 00:40:21,800
 Great news, don't worry.

980
00:40:21,800 --> 00:40:27,800
 We've managed to get your sentence commuted from decapitation to deboditation.

981
00:40:27,800 --> 00:40:33,800
 Andy, do you have a relative in North Carolina called Joan?

982
00:40:33,800 --> 00:40:34,800
 Not that I know.

983
00:40:34,800 --> 00:40:38,800
 Okay. I was reading the story, a lady called Joan Murray, in America.

984
00:40:38,800 --> 00:40:43,800
 She went parachuting, skydiving, and this is extraordinary.

985
00:40:43,800 --> 00:40:47,800
 Her parachute didn't open, so she plummeted to the earth.

986
00:40:47,800 --> 00:40:51,800
 She approached the ground at 80 miles an hour, and as she landed,

987
00:40:51,800 --> 00:40:54,800
 she landed on a mound of fire ants.

988
00:40:54,800 --> 00:40:57,800
 And doctors reckon, I got this off Wikipedia,

989
00:40:57,800 --> 00:41:02,800
 doctors reckon that the shock of having been stung over 200 times by the ants,

990
00:41:02,800 --> 00:41:05,800
 as she landed on them, released a surge of adrenaline into her

991
00:41:05,800 --> 00:41:09,800
 that kept her heart beating so that when the emergency services got there,

992
00:41:09,800 --> 00:41:11,800
 and she's still alive to this day.

993
00:41:11,800 --> 00:41:12,800
 Wow.

994
00:41:12,800 --> 00:41:13,800
 Wow.

995
00:41:13,800 --> 00:41:16,800
 I wouldn't have thought, hitting into the ground after your parachute not opening.

996
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:19,800
 I wouldn't have thought that the thing that killed you would be a heart attack.

997
00:41:19,800 --> 00:41:20,800
 Yeah.

998
00:41:20,800 --> 00:41:24,800
 I would have thought it would be the crunching up of all of your bodily bones in organs.

999
00:41:24,800 --> 00:41:27,800
 But if you landed on a mound.

1000
00:41:27,800 --> 00:41:28,800
 Yeah.

1001
00:41:28,800 --> 00:41:30,800
 And then they repaired all your wounds with their mandibles.

1002
00:41:30,800 --> 00:41:31,800
 Yes.

1003
00:41:31,800 --> 00:41:33,800
 They stitched you as you land.

1004
00:41:33,800 --> 00:41:35,800
 Do you think they all basically caught her, maybe?

1005
00:41:35,800 --> 00:41:36,800
 Yeah, effectively.

1006
00:41:36,800 --> 00:41:39,800
 I guess you do have accounts of people falling on, I don't know,

1007
00:41:39,800 --> 00:41:42,800
 trees and hay bales and stuff like that and managing to survive.

1008
00:41:42,800 --> 00:41:47,800
 So supposedly she did her heart stopped, and then she got bit so many times.

1009
00:41:47,800 --> 00:41:54,800
 I think it's stories like this that the phrase citation needed was invented.

1010
00:41:54,800 --> 00:41:55,800
 No, I do believe that.

1011
00:41:55,800 --> 00:41:56,800
 They do actually say they don't.

1012
00:41:56,800 --> 00:42:01,800
 They don't often, if you're falling out of a building or something, that what.

1013
00:42:01,800 --> 00:42:04,800
 I'm going to aim for that.

1014
00:42:04,800 --> 00:42:10,800
 And so so strong relative to their body size.

1015
00:42:10,800 --> 00:42:13,800
 From this height, all those people look like us.

1016
00:42:13,800 --> 00:42:19,800
 I know, I'm one foot away from the floor.

1017
00:42:19,800 --> 00:42:21,800
 They don't say any of that.

1018
00:42:21,800 --> 00:42:25,800
 They just say that you have a heart attack on the way down off and that kills you.

1019
00:42:25,800 --> 00:42:26,800
 Do they?

1020
00:42:26,800 --> 00:42:27,800
 Yeah, yeah, I think they do.

1021
00:42:27,800 --> 00:42:28,800
 So it is plausible.

1022
00:42:28,800 --> 00:42:29,800
 Wow.

1023
00:42:29,800 --> 00:42:30,800
 Not sort of stupid facts.

1024
00:42:30,800 --> 00:42:33,800
 Do you guys want so busy mocking what I've said before?

1025
00:42:33,800 --> 00:42:40,800
 I might have stepped in to save you earlier.

1026
00:42:40,800 --> 00:42:42,800
 Okay, that's it.

1027
