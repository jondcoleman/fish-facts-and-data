00:00:00,00:00:02,(upbeat music)
00:00:02,00:00:17,- Hello and welcome to another episode
00:00:17,00:00:20,"of No Such Thing as a Fish, a weekly podcast coming to you"
00:00:20,00:00:24,for the first time from the new QI offices in Hoburn.
00:00:24,00:00:25,My name is Dan Schreiber.
00:00:25,00:00:27,"I am sitting here with Andrew Hunter Murray,"
00:00:27,00:00:30,James Harkin and here to cut the red ribbon
00:00:30,00:00:33,and officially open the new Fish podcasting headquarters
00:00:33,00:00:36,"is the founder of QI himself, John Lloyd."
00:00:36,00:00:38,"And once again, we have gathered around the microphones"
00:00:38,00:00:41,with our four favorite facts from the last seven days.
00:00:41,00:00:44,"And in no particular order, here we go."
00:00:44,00:00:48,"Starting with fact number one, that is Andy."
00:00:48,00:00:50,My fact is that there was a job in medieval times
00:00:50,00:00:52,called the municipal swine herd
00:00:52,00:00:56,who was effectively a professional pig walker for city dwellers
00:00:56,00:00:58,who didn't want to walk their own pigs.
00:00:58,00:00:59,- Right.
00:00:59,00:01:01,(laughing)
00:01:01,00:01:03,- It's just a job that you used to be able to get.
00:01:03,00:01:05,"Before we go any further, actually,"
00:01:05,00:01:06,I should say this fact was sent in to us
00:01:06,00:01:11,at podcast@qi.com by a listener sent in by Andrew Salamone.
00:01:11,00:01:13,"So thank you very much indeed for it, Andrew."
00:01:13,00:01:14,- Were they on leashes?
00:01:14,00:01:16,"- No, I don't think they were."
00:01:16,00:01:19,- That's a more difficult job than I reckon
00:01:19,00:01:22,'cause you're corraling the pigs as well as walking them.
00:01:22,00:01:23,"- It's difficult in that way,"
00:01:23,00:01:24,but it's also very hard.
00:01:24,00:01:25,I imagine to keep a pig on a leash
00:01:25,00:01:26,if it doesn't want to be.
00:01:26,00:01:27,- Is it?
00:01:27,00:01:28,- Really?
00:01:28,00:01:29,The pigs are very strong.
00:01:29,00:01:31,- But they're also very intelligent and can be trained.
00:01:31,00:01:33,You can teach a pig to dance.
00:01:33,00:01:34,"- No, you're right."
00:01:34,00:01:36,"Well, yeah, I don't think they were."
00:01:36,00:01:38,This was in the middle ages.
00:01:38,00:01:39,"- Sorry, John, can I just pick you up on,"
00:01:39,00:01:41,you can teach a pig to dance?
00:01:41,00:01:42,"- Yeah, well, they're very intelligent."
00:01:42,00:01:43,(laughing)
00:01:43,00:01:46,"They're right at the top of the animal league,"
00:01:46,00:01:48,"smarter than dogs, sheep, and horses."
00:01:48,00:01:50,"They can be house trained, taught to fetch, come to heal."
00:01:50,00:01:53,"They can pull carts, they can sniff out landmines."
00:01:53,00:01:55,- But can I bring you back to the dancing point?
00:01:55,00:01:56,Pigs can dance.
00:01:56,00:01:58,"- Apparently they can, yes."
00:01:58,00:02:00,- Were they sort of like vaudeville acts or?
00:02:00,00:02:01,- It's mainly flamenco dancing.
00:02:01,00:02:03,(laughing)
00:02:03,00:02:06,They'd click their little heels together like castanets.
00:02:06,00:02:07,- Brilliant.
00:02:07,00:02:09,- They like watching television.
00:02:09,00:02:11,"They have their own favorite programs, pet pigs."
00:02:11,00:02:12,- Peppa Pig?
00:02:12,00:02:14,- I don't know if Peppa Pig can watch television.
00:02:14,00:02:15,"- No, I was wondering if Peppa Pig"
00:02:15,00:02:17,was one of their favorite TV shows.
00:02:17,00:02:18,"- I'm sorry to be late to this,"
00:02:18,00:02:20,but the Fox Trotter would be an example
00:02:20,00:02:21,of a dancer pig could do.
00:02:21,00:02:24,- And Southpawk would be a TV show they might like.
00:02:24,00:02:25,- There we go.
00:02:25,00:02:26,- Southpawk.
00:02:26,00:02:27,(laughing)
00:02:27,00:02:29,- Should we stragg us away from this one?
00:02:29,00:02:30,"- Oh yeah, sorry, yeah, yeah."
00:02:30,00:02:32,"Back into the middle late as we go, hooray."
00:02:32,00:02:36,"So these are the first professional pig husbands,"
00:02:36,00:02:37,I guess you would call them in Europe.
00:02:37,00:02:39,"They were these village swine herds,"
00:02:39,00:02:42,and it was in a time when everyone had their own pig.
00:02:42,00:02:44,A pig was an amazingly useful thing to have.
00:02:44,00:02:46,"It was a waste disposal unit,"
00:02:46,00:02:49,but it was a waste disposal unit made of pork.
00:02:49,00:02:50,What a delicious--
00:02:50,00:02:51,- Go into that a bit more?
00:02:51,00:02:54,"- You feed it leftovers and scraps from the household,"
00:02:54,00:02:55,"and then when winter comes, you eat the pig."
00:02:55,00:02:57,- It's like if you can eat your wheely bin.
00:02:57,00:02:59,"- Yeah, 'cause no, in the Flintstones,"
00:02:59,00:03:02,"that's what they, the trash is a dinosaur"
00:03:02,00:03:04,that eats the trash sitting in a drawer.
00:03:04,00:03:05,So it's kind of like that.
00:03:05,00:03:07,- It's probably based on these academic studies
00:03:07,00:03:09,"of medieval municipal swine herds, yeah."
00:03:09,00:03:12,"And there was a pig daycare thing, though,"
00:03:12,00:03:14,"because you didn't want to look after your own pig all day,"
00:03:14,00:03:18,"being a busy middle-class peasant in the middle ages,"
00:03:18,00:03:20,and you would have a village swine herd
00:03:20,00:03:24,who was rewarded with a sucking pig each year
00:03:24,00:03:27,and the entrails of any animal which had been slaughtered.
00:03:27,00:03:28,So--
00:03:28,00:03:29,"- What did the sucking pig actually do,"
00:03:29,00:03:31,or is that a vulgar question?
00:03:31,00:03:32,(laughing)
00:03:32,00:03:34,"- You said they could be trained to do anything, John,"
00:03:34,00:03:35,is that it?
00:03:35,00:03:37,(laughing)
00:03:37,00:03:39,- But they are party animals pigs.
00:03:39,00:03:44,Some pig farmers keep lights on in the sky at night.
00:03:44,00:03:46,"When the farmers go home at the end of the day,"
00:03:46,00:03:47,"the pigs don't settle down,"
00:03:47,00:03:50,"they start eating, drinking, and having fun for small hours."
00:03:50,00:03:52,That's actually their favorite show this day at night.
00:03:52,00:03:55,(laughing)
00:03:55,00:03:58,"Actually, I read one cool thing about lights in pigsties,"
00:03:58,00:04:02,"and that is to get rid of the smell in pigsties,"
00:04:02,00:04:05,you can paint it with titanium oxide paint
00:04:05,00:04:07,"and then fire UV light at the paint,"
00:04:07,00:04:10,"and that will somehow break down the chemicals,"
00:04:10,00:04:11,which will stop it from smelling.
00:04:11,00:04:14,And it's even better if you put a disco ball
00:04:14,00:04:15,"in the middle of the pigstie,"
00:04:15,00:04:18,it will fire the UV light out in all different directions
00:04:18,00:04:21,and it will make it smell better more quickly.
00:04:21,00:04:23,- And you know why the disco ball's there
00:04:23,00:04:23,because of the dance?
00:04:23,00:04:25,"- Yes, exactly."
00:04:25,00:04:28,(laughing)
00:04:28,00:04:31,"- Medieval pigs don't look like our modern day pig,"
00:04:31,00:04:35,and this is something that has led to a lot of annoyance
00:04:35,00:04:36,"in the world of academia,"
00:04:36,00:04:38,because a lot of medieval scholars
00:04:38,00:04:39,"are constantly finding themselves,"
00:04:39,00:04:42,"I say constantly, it's one guy as far as I can find,"
00:04:42,00:04:43,being pissed off by their representation
00:04:43,00:04:46,within video games these days.
00:04:46,00:04:48,"So there's a lot of video games like Assassin's Creed,"
00:04:48,00:04:51,"Valhalla, there's Medieval Dynasty Foundation,"
00:04:51,00:04:54,"where they represent pigs as a modern day pig,"
00:04:54,00:04:55,"it's pink and it's hairless,"
00:04:55,00:04:57,it looks nothing like the pig is today.
00:04:57,00:04:58,- Minecraft?
00:04:58,00:04:59,- Maybe in Minecraft.
00:04:59,00:04:59,- There are pigs in Minecraft?
00:04:59,00:05:01,"- Minecraft, yeah."
00:05:01,00:05:03,(laughing)
00:05:03,00:05:05,"And so actually of the time,"
00:05:05,00:05:08,"if we wanna picture an old pig,"
00:05:08,00:05:11,"it's a long legged, they're quite small, long snouts,"
00:05:11,00:05:14,"very lean figure, they had arch-crested backs,"
00:05:14,00:05:17,"and they had long curved tusks as well,"
00:05:17,00:05:18,according to the academic.
00:05:18,00:05:20,- I suppose if you made them look like that
00:05:20,00:05:23,"in the video game, people might not realise they were pigs."
00:05:23,00:05:25,"- Yeah, and what you've described as a stalk, basically,"
00:05:25,00:05:26,as far as I can tell.
00:05:26,00:05:29,(laughing)
00:05:29,00:05:29,"- Wow, okay."
00:05:29,00:05:31,"- But you mentioned Leeds,"
00:05:31,00:05:34,"did you know the thing about GÃ©rard de Neval,"
00:05:34,00:05:36,"the 19th century French poet,"
00:05:36,00:05:38,"who had a pet lobster called Thibault,"
00:05:38,00:05:41,"which used to walk around Paris on a blue silk ribbon,"
00:05:41,00:05:43,so he did have a lead for the lobster.
00:05:43,00:05:44,- He could walk on a lead.
00:05:44,00:05:46,"- He was asked why he had a lobster as a pet,"
00:05:46,00:05:48,"and he said, ""They are peaceful, serious creatures."
00:05:48,00:05:51,"""They know the secrets of the sea, and they don't bark."""
00:05:51,00:05:52,And it was a very--
00:05:52,00:05:54,- He know the secrets of the sea.
00:05:54,00:05:57,"- It was a very sedate job, 'cause I checked this out."
00:05:57,00:06:00,"In lab tests, the maximum recorded walking speed"
00:06:00,00:06:03,"of a lobster is 2.5 metres per minute,"
00:06:03,00:06:05,or 144 metres an hour.
00:06:05,00:06:08,"- That's a good easy job, a professional lobster walker."
00:06:08,00:06:10,"- It feels like at some stage,"
00:06:10,00:06:12,"you would end up dragging a lobster more than walking it,"
00:06:12,00:06:13,doesn't it?
00:06:13,00:06:16,- Maybe you got to get back for lobster dragging.
00:06:16,00:06:20,"- I did the other day in a big railway station,"
00:06:20,00:06:22,I saw someone who had a ferret on a lead.
00:06:22,00:06:23,That was nice. - Did you?
00:06:23,00:06:25,"- Yeah, which you do see occasionally."
00:06:25,00:06:26,"- Yeah. - You know,"
00:06:26,00:06:26,'cause they don't need to be--
00:06:26,00:06:27,- So you pull it out of your trousers.
00:06:27,00:06:30,(all laughing)
00:06:30,00:06:32,- I got sent a picture from my friend Emi in Hong Kong
00:06:32,00:06:34,of someone walking a lizard on a lead.
00:06:34,00:06:35,"- Really? - Like one of those big,"
00:06:35,00:06:36,big lizards.
00:06:36,00:06:37,"- What, like a commuter dragon?"
00:06:37,00:06:38,"- Yeah, exactly. - No."
00:06:38,00:06:39,- But not a commuter dragon.
00:06:39,00:06:41,"No, no, no, but like sizeable."
00:06:41,00:06:43,- Did a real lizard or a shape-shifting lizard?
00:06:43,00:06:44,"- It was, yeah, it was one of the members"
00:06:44,00:06:46,of the Royal Family in Hong Kong.
00:06:46,00:06:48,"- Monitor, I guess."
00:06:48,00:06:48,"- Yeah, it could be."
00:06:48,00:06:50,Yeah.
00:06:50,00:06:51,"- I went into my local,"
00:06:51,00:06:55,"sorry, no, just bragging about animals we've seen lately,"
00:06:55,00:06:58,but I went into an aquarium shop the other day.
00:06:58,00:06:59,"- Ah, yeah."
00:06:59,00:07:00,- I was trying to buy some--
00:07:00,00:07:01,- Fish.
00:07:01,00:07:03,"- Sprintails, actually."
00:07:03,00:07:04,"You know, sprintails, there's tiny insects."
00:07:04,00:07:06,- Yes. - Why do you buy those?
00:07:06,00:07:08,- I needed to fertilize some soil.
00:07:08,00:07:10,(all laughing)
00:07:10,00:07:14,I did a terrarium workshop and I made a terrarium.
00:07:14,00:07:15,"Anyway, I went in there to get my sprintails,"
00:07:15,00:07:17,"which was very cheap,"
00:07:17,00:07:19,three quid for a big box of sprintails.
00:07:19,00:07:21,"Anyway, they had an axolotl in there."
00:07:21,00:07:22,"- Oh, yeah. - I was staggered."
00:07:22,00:07:24,"'Cause I thought, you know, they're very rare."
00:07:24,00:07:25,- Did you not buy it?
00:07:25,00:07:26,- No. - No.
00:07:26,00:07:27,- Really interesting. - I didn't know
00:07:27,00:07:28,where to put it.
00:07:28,00:07:29,And the guy who ran the aquarium shop was quite annoyed
00:07:29,00:07:31,"'cause he said when he doesn't have an axolotl in,"
00:07:31,00:07:32,"people only ever say,"
00:07:32,00:07:34,"""Well, do you not have any axolotls?"""
00:07:34,00:07:36,"And then, when he does,"
00:07:36,00:07:37,they just come in and look at the axolotl
00:07:37,00:07:38,"and then don't buy it, you know."
00:07:38,00:07:40,They treat it like a zoo.
00:07:40,00:07:42,- That does feel like one person is going in there
00:07:42,00:07:44,every week as a joke and asking for axolotls.
00:07:44,00:07:45,(all laughing)
00:07:45,00:07:47,- Is an axolotl an amphibian?
00:07:47,00:07:48,- Yeah. - I think it is.
00:07:48,00:07:51,"- Yeah, 'cause they're extinct in the wild, apparently."
00:07:51,00:07:54,"Yes, they're only in two canals in Mexico City now."
00:07:54,00:07:57,"Yeah, apart from zoos."
00:07:57,00:07:59,"And the, because I ask amphibians"
00:07:59,00:08:04,because another great medieval job was a frog stoner.
00:08:04,00:08:07,"They used to hire people to throw pebbles into ponds,"
00:08:07,00:08:08,shut the frogs up at night.
00:08:08,00:08:10,(all laughing)
00:08:10,00:08:11,- Partying as well.
00:08:11,00:08:13,"- Yeah, the animal king was all parties."
00:08:13,00:08:17,But I did think it's a pretty boring job
00:08:17,00:08:19,"for a pig walker in the middle ages,"
00:08:19,00:08:21,a municipal swine herd.
00:08:21,00:08:24,And I thought we should come up with a better name.
00:08:24,00:08:27,So there's some great walking words.
00:08:27,00:08:30,"Plutch, to flap the feet while walking like a seabird"
00:08:30,00:08:32,from Shetland.
00:08:32,00:08:35,"Prol, a short enjoyable walk that's from Kent."
00:08:35,00:08:37,"Proper stroll, I should think it stands for."
00:08:37,00:08:41,"Shove, to saunter with extreme laziness from East Anglia."
00:08:41,00:08:44,"To spandle, to leave wet footprints on the floor."
00:08:44,00:08:45,Another Kentish stoner.
00:08:45,00:08:47,- So do you think swine spandler?
00:08:47,00:08:49,- I think it's exactly a hog-plutcher.
00:08:49,00:08:51,- Hog-plutcher. (all laughing)
00:08:51,00:08:52,"- Now, what's this thing?"
00:08:52,00:08:54,"Like, so later on after the medieval pig thing,"
00:08:54,00:08:57,urban pigs were a big deal.
00:08:57,00:08:59,"Basically, in Manchester, everyone had their own pig."
00:08:59,00:09:02,"And we know this partly 'cause of Friedrich Engels,"
00:09:02,00:09:04,who was writing about the conditions
00:09:04,00:09:08,"of the working class in England in the 1840s, 1845."
00:09:08,00:09:10,And he wrote that that was the case.
00:09:10,00:09:12,And another writer was describing North Kensington.
00:09:12,00:09:15,"And in the mid-19th century, in North Kensington,"
00:09:15,00:09:17,pigs outnumbered people three to one.
00:09:17,00:09:18,- Really?
00:09:18,00:09:20,- Quite a lot.
00:09:20,00:09:22,- There's more pigs in Spain now than humans.
00:09:22,00:09:23,- Really? - Yeah.
00:09:23,00:09:26,- Pigs in Spain.
00:09:26,00:09:30,"In the 1820s, there were more pigs in Manhattan"
00:09:30,00:09:33,than there are cars in New York today.
00:09:33,00:09:34,- Wow.
00:09:34,00:09:37,"- Well, you know the movie, ""The Wolf of Wall Street""?"
00:09:37,00:09:39,"- No, it was previously gonna be called"
00:09:39,00:09:40,"""The Three Little Pigs of Wall Street."""
00:09:40,00:09:43,- It should have been called that as a prequel.
00:09:43,00:09:46,"The prequel would have been that, exactly that,"
00:09:46,00:09:49,"because the wall of Wall Street initially was a wall, right?"
00:09:49,00:09:50,This is when the Dutch were there.
00:09:50,00:09:51,"- Oh, I see."
00:09:51,00:09:52,"- And they built, yeah, they built this wall."
00:09:52,00:09:56,"And this was during the 1600s, so 1653 to 1699."
00:09:56,00:09:58,"As they were building the wall,"
00:09:58,00:10:01,there was a picket fence that was there before.
00:10:01,00:10:02,- A picket fence.
00:10:02,00:10:03,"- A picket fence, yeah."
00:10:03,00:10:04,And it kept getting knocked down by pigs.
00:10:04,00:10:06,So it was a huge problem.
00:10:06,00:10:08,And they brought in municipal swine herds
00:10:08,00:10:09,to try and curb it.
00:10:09,00:10:10,And that didn't happen.
00:10:10,00:10:14,So then they had to decree that you had to keep your pigs
00:10:14,00:10:18,at home until the construction of Wall Street was built.
00:10:18,00:10:20,"- So the Dutch thing, New Amsterdam,"
00:10:20,00:10:23,"I happen to know that there's a Dutch word, Udvijn,"
00:10:23,00:10:26,which means to take a bracing walk in the wind.
00:10:26,00:10:27,Isn't that a lovely thing to have a word for?
00:10:27,00:10:28,"- Oh, that's good, yeah."
00:10:28,00:10:31,- And then the Dutch for pig is big.
00:10:31,00:10:32,- Is it really big?
00:10:32,00:10:33,"- It's big, yeah."
00:10:33,00:10:33,- That's correct.
00:10:33,00:10:35,You're learning Dutch at the moment.
00:10:35,00:10:36,"- I am, yes."
00:10:36,00:10:40,- What was the phrase you gave us just before the show started?
00:10:40,00:10:44,- (speaks in foreign language)
00:10:44,00:10:46,- Which translates as...
00:10:46,00:10:49,- How do we know if the animals in the zoo are happy?
00:10:49,00:10:51,- Great.
00:10:51,00:10:53,- They're philosophical people.
00:10:53,00:10:54,- Do you know truffle pigs?
00:10:54,00:10:55,"You've heard of truffle pigs, right?"
00:10:55,00:10:56,"- Yeah, yeah."
00:10:56,00:10:57,- That hunt for truffles.
00:10:57,00:10:59,"And in the Middle Ages,"
00:10:59,00:11:01,"they didn't, they did hunt for truffles,"
00:11:01,00:11:03,but they ate them because nobody in the Middle Ages
00:11:03,00:11:04,ate truffles.
00:11:04,00:11:05,They thought that was weird.
00:11:05,00:11:06,- I agree.
00:11:06,00:11:11,"- Foxes, badges, wolves, wild boar, pigs and rats ate truffles."
00:11:11,00:11:14,And they only came back into favor in the Renaissance.
00:11:14,00:11:15,So I got interested in truffles.
00:11:15,00:11:17,"And Rossini, the composer,"
00:11:17,00:11:19,"called the truffle the Mozart of fungi,"
00:11:19,00:11:21,"which is rather nice, isn't it?"
00:11:21,00:11:22,- Oh.
00:11:22,00:11:24,- And he claimed to have only cried three times
00:11:24,00:11:26,"in his life, Rossini."
00:11:26,00:11:29,"Once when his first opera was booed,"
00:11:29,00:11:31,"once when he had Paganini play the violin,"
00:11:31,00:11:33,and once when he was picnic on a boat
00:11:33,00:11:35,and the truffle turkey fell overboard.
00:11:35,00:11:37,(laughing)
00:11:37,00:11:39,(upbeat music)
00:11:39,00:11:43,"- Okay, it is time for fact number two."
00:11:43,00:11:45,And that is my fact.
00:11:45,00:11:47,My fact this week is that the comedian Bob Hope
00:11:47,00:11:51,"was so reliant on his writers to come up with jokes for him,"
00:11:51,00:11:53,he even had them provide bespoke one-liners
00:11:53,00:11:55,for his social life.
00:11:55,00:11:57,So we all know Bob Hope.
00:11:57,00:11:59,- A lot of people don't these days.
00:11:59,00:12:00,(laughing)
00:12:00,00:12:01,"- Just in case, just in case."
00:12:01,00:12:03,- It fell on Stony Grandin.
00:12:03,00:12:04,Let's move on to the third fact.
00:12:04,00:12:07,(laughing)
00:12:07,00:12:08,- So Bob Hope.
00:12:08,00:12:09,- So you said comedian.
00:12:09,00:12:10,- Yeah.
00:12:10,00:12:12,- Bob Hope was possibly the biggest comedian in the world.
00:12:12,00:12:13,- He was huge.
00:12:13,00:12:14,- He was huge.
00:12:14,00:12:15,He lived to 100 years old.
00:12:15,00:12:17,He hosted the Oscars 19 times.
00:12:17,00:12:20,He was a box office hit during the '40s.
00:12:20,00:12:22,Number one movie at one point in the '40s
00:12:22,00:12:24,was a Bob Hope movie.
00:12:24,00:12:28,"He received its estimated 38,000 fan letters per week"
00:12:28,00:12:30,during the 1940s.
00:12:30,00:12:31,This is how loved he was.
00:12:31,00:12:35,But he's the person who effectively created the idea
00:12:35,00:12:37,of the modern standup monologue
00:12:37,00:12:39,"where he incorporated himself, the audience,"
00:12:39,00:12:43,"the situation around him, the topical news of the day."
00:12:43,00:12:45,And he used to hire so many writers.
00:12:45,00:12:47,He was the first person to acknowledge
00:12:47,00:12:49,"he had writers as well, properly."
00:12:49,00:12:52,"He would mention, hold the cue cards up higher"
00:12:52,00:12:53,"during his act, be quicker on that."
00:12:53,00:12:55,You wouldn't say that if my writers were here.
00:12:55,00:12:56,Those kind of lines.
00:12:56,00:13:00,"And yeah, and so, so much was he reliant on it that,"
00:13:00,00:13:03,"as I say, even if he was going on like a golf game"
00:13:03,00:13:05,and he knew that he had some powerful CEOs there
00:13:05,00:13:06,"that he wanted to impress,"
00:13:06,00:13:08,they would write these jokes for him
00:13:08,00:13:09,and he would memorize them and bust them out
00:13:09,00:13:10,as if they were ad libs.
00:13:10,00:13:11,- Great idea.
00:13:11,00:13:12,- Yeah.
00:13:12,00:13:13,- I'd love that.
00:13:13,00:13:15,- He'd gotten a lot of stick from other comedians.
00:13:15,00:13:18,The Lenny Bruce's and the growing world of comedians
00:13:18,00:13:21,who were auteur and wrote their own material
00:13:21,00:13:24,'cause they saw him as an actor as opposed to a comedian.
00:13:24,00:13:27,But I'm a big fan of the way that he led his life.
00:13:27,00:13:29,"I think, and his comedy life particularly,"
00:13:29,00:13:31,I think that he innovated so many things.
00:13:31,00:13:33,"So if he was gonna play in a town,"
00:13:33,00:13:36,"he would send his writers ahead, days ahead,"
00:13:36,00:13:37,and they would scope around the whole town.
00:13:37,00:13:39,They would look at the local shops.
00:13:39,00:13:40,They would meet the local people
00:13:40,00:13:42,and they would base the material they wrote for him on that.
00:13:42,00:13:43,"- It would have been weird though,"
00:13:43,00:13:46,if he's doing a joke about the local hardware shop.
00:13:46,00:13:47,"- No, I think that's..."
00:13:47,00:13:49,"- Well, do you remember like when we went on tour,"
00:13:49,00:13:51,we would do facts about the local town?
00:13:51,00:13:52,"- Oh yeah, but that was good."
00:13:52,00:13:53,That was great.
00:13:53,00:13:56,"That was, you know, that was a very different..."
00:13:56,00:13:58,"- John, did you ever meet Bob Hope?"
00:13:58,00:13:59,"- No, but I spoke to him."
00:13:59,00:14:00,- Really? - Yeah.
00:14:00,00:14:01,"One Christmas Eve,"
00:14:01,00:14:04,I used to produce a live radio two-show
00:14:04,00:14:06,"called Late Night Extra when I was very, very young,"
00:14:06,00:14:10,"sort of 24 or something like that, 23 even."
00:14:10,00:14:13,And I was producing one on Christmas Eve
00:14:13,00:14:16,and I had the best address book in the world probably.
00:14:16,00:14:17,It was amazing.
00:14:17,00:14:18,Everybody's singing.
00:14:18,00:14:19,"For some reason, I had Bob Hope's phone number,"
00:14:19,00:14:23,so I phoned him up in California on Christmas Eve
00:14:23,00:14:25,"and said, ""Hey, Bob, how's it going?"""
00:14:25,00:14:26,"He goes, ""Who is this? Who is this?"""
00:14:26,00:14:28,"I said, ""It's the BBC in London, Mr. Hope."""
00:14:28,00:14:32,"He goes, ""Oh, hi there. Hi, guy, how are you?"""
00:14:32,00:14:34,He was great.
00:14:34,00:14:35,- Have you still got the number?
00:14:35,00:14:35,Let's call it now.
00:14:35,00:14:37,(laughing)
00:14:37,00:14:38,- He picks up.
00:14:38,00:14:41,"- But he was interesting that his attitude to write,"
00:14:41,00:14:42,he paid them very well.
00:14:42,00:14:44,"He didn't acknowledge them,"
00:14:44,00:14:46,but he didn't think the writing was the big deal.
00:14:46,00:14:49,He said creating the character was the thing
00:14:49,00:14:51,and the lines were just something that the character said.
00:14:51,00:14:54,"- Yeah, weirdly, a lot of people in recent biographies"
00:14:54,00:14:56,say that he was terrible at paying his writers.
00:14:56,00:14:59,That was sort of an idea that he was really good.
00:14:59,00:15:02,Jack Benny would pay two writers the same amount.
00:15:02,00:15:04,"Jack Benny being another giant comedian of the day,"
00:15:04,00:15:07,the same amount that Bob would pay 20 writers.
00:15:07,00:15:08,What he'd do is he'd find the young writers.
00:15:08,00:15:10,- Didn't you say that Jack Benny hated him
00:15:10,00:15:11,'cause he had writers?
00:15:11,00:15:12,"- Not Jack Benny, no."
00:15:12,00:15:14,"- Oh, I thought you said people like Jack Benny."
00:15:14,00:15:15,- Lenny Bruce.
00:15:15,00:15:16,- Lenny Bruce.
00:15:16,00:15:20,Jack Benny and Lenny Bruce are both double first-namers.
00:15:20,00:15:22,"Yeah, like Craig David or David Cameron."
00:15:22,00:15:23,Anyway.
00:15:23,00:15:25,- Do you know who Bob Hope's most famous writer
00:15:25,00:15:26,was the least the one I'd heard of?
00:15:26,00:15:27,- No.
00:15:27,00:15:29,- Larry Gelbart.
00:15:29,00:15:29,"- Oh yeah, who's that?"
00:15:29,00:15:30,- When he was very young.
00:15:30,00:15:32,"He was the guy who wrote ""Mash."""
00:15:32,00:15:33,"- Oh wow, okay."
00:15:33,00:15:35,"- And Bob Hope, one of the things he used to do was tour."
00:15:35,00:15:38,"He was basically, not only as you say it, Dan,"
00:15:38,00:15:39,"but he sort of invent stand-up comedy,"
00:15:39,00:15:43,but the touring American forces in the '40s and '50s
00:15:43,00:15:44,"was also a thing that was really,"
00:15:44,00:15:47,nobody had ever thought of doing that before.
00:15:47,00:15:50,And he did a lot and Larry Gelbart worked for him
00:15:50,00:15:53,as a very young man and he was inspired by a tour
00:15:53,00:15:56,"of the Far East to write ""Mash."""
00:15:56,00:15:58,"- Yeah, Bob Hope famously used to do a Christmas show"
00:15:58,00:16:00,that he would do from the front lines
00:16:00,00:16:03,of wherever a war might be going and after a war
00:16:03,00:16:05,while people were still stationed out there.
00:16:05,00:16:07,So most comedians and acts would go out
00:16:07,00:16:10,while it was wartime and he kind of continued on.
00:16:10,00:16:11,So he died age 100.
00:16:11,00:16:14,He did 48 Christmases out on the road.
00:16:14,00:16:16,So 48 of his Christmases were spent
00:16:16,00:16:17,in a different country performing to troops.
00:16:17,00:16:19,- And one of them speaking to John Lloyd.
00:16:19,00:16:20,- And one of them speaking to Lloyd.
00:16:20,00:16:23,"- Yeah, in a way, like being in a war zone, you know."
00:16:23,00:16:26,"- But you're, sorry."
00:16:26,00:16:28,"- ""Hope You Christmas"" should have been the name of the show."
00:16:28,00:16:30,"- ""Hope You Christmas"" doesn't get ever was."
00:16:30,00:16:32,"- God, he had 48 goes to get that and you didn't."
00:16:32,00:16:32,- Never got that.
00:16:32,00:16:34,"- Never got that, exactly."
00:16:34,00:16:36,"- Hope is a first name, by the way."
00:16:36,00:16:36,- Is it?
00:16:36,00:16:38,"- Yeah, it's a woman's name."
00:16:38,00:16:40,- Bob Hope joins the ranks of...
00:16:40,00:16:42,(laughing)
00:16:42,00:16:45,- But I was reading that about the wartime thing.
00:16:45,00:16:45,"- Sorry, sorry, sorry."
00:16:45,00:16:48,"- Jerry Lewis, two first names."
00:16:48,00:16:48,"- Jerry Lewis, yeah."
00:16:48,00:16:50,"- Dean Marden, two first names."
00:16:50,00:16:51,- Yeah.
00:16:51,00:16:52,- Did they all have first names?
00:16:52,00:16:53,- That's extraordinary.
00:16:53,00:16:55,"- Frank Sinatra, no."
00:16:55,00:16:56,- But he's not a comedian.
00:16:56,00:16:57,"- Great point, all right, on we go."
00:16:57,00:16:59,- The thing about his war shows.
00:16:59,00:17:00,- Andy Murray.
00:17:00,00:17:00,"- Oh, that's good."
00:17:00,00:17:01,"- Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:17:01,00:17:02,- So it's not always comedians.
00:17:02,00:17:03,- John Lloyd.
00:17:03,00:17:04,(laughing)
00:17:04,00:17:06,"- Yeah, fair enough, John Lloyd, yeah."
00:17:06,00:17:08,- I think John Lloyd and Andy Murray
00:17:08,00:17:10,are in those weird category of like Lloyd and Murray
00:17:10,00:17:12,are kind of first names and kind of surname.
00:17:12,00:17:13,"You know, they can be both."
00:17:13,00:17:13,- Yeah.
00:17:13,00:17:16,"- It's not the pure simplicity of it, Greg David."
00:17:16,00:17:17,- Agreed.
00:17:17,00:17:17,- Okay.
00:17:17,00:17:20,Did you have something come on?
00:17:20,00:17:21,"- I did, I did."
00:17:21,00:17:21,"- Well, no, I was just gonna say"
00:17:21,00:17:24,what was particularly touching about the war shows
00:17:24,00:17:28,"is that for a lot of parents, brothers and sisters,"
00:17:28,00:17:29,"whatever, friends at home,"
00:17:29,00:17:32,this was the only time that they were able to see
00:17:32,00:17:34,possibly one of their family members
00:17:34,00:17:37,who was off at war on camera during Christmas time.
00:17:37,00:17:40,"So a lot of the 38,000 letters that came to Bob Hope"
00:17:40,00:17:43,was from people saying I got to see my boy
00:17:43,00:17:45,sitting there in the crowd laughing at your jokes
00:17:45,00:17:47,and he didn't make it.
00:17:47,00:17:48,He lost his life to the war.
00:17:48,00:17:50,Thank you for giving me that moment
00:17:50,00:17:51,where I could connect with him.
00:17:51,00:17:53,So they were really important shows
00:17:53,00:17:55,to America at the time.
00:17:55,00:17:57,- His last military gig was in 1990
00:17:57,00:18:00,when he went to the Gulf at the age of--
00:18:00,00:18:00,- '87.
00:18:00,00:18:01,"- '87, yeah."
00:18:01,00:18:05,"And lots of the troops in the crowd for his final gig,"
00:18:05,00:18:07,they had fathers who had seen him in Vietnam
00:18:07,00:18:10,and some of them had grandfathers who had seen Bob Hope
00:18:10,00:18:12,in the second world war performing.
00:18:12,00:18:13,"It's mad, the idea that you go to a gig"
00:18:13,00:18:15,and your grandfather saw the same comedian.
00:18:15,00:18:18,"- Yeah, I mean, lucky that you managed to get two generations"
00:18:18,00:18:19,that they didn't die in the past.
00:18:19,00:18:22,"- Yeah, that's true, yeah, that's true, yeah."
00:18:22,00:18:23,"While reading about this,"
00:18:23,00:18:26,I found my favorite new human.
00:18:26,00:18:29,"Yeah, just like, it's an exciting character."
00:18:29,00:18:31,So this is to do with the writers and so on.
00:18:31,00:18:34,It's a guy called Barney McNulty.
00:18:34,00:18:36,Bob Hope used to bring him everywhere with him.
00:18:36,00:18:37,What do you think he did?
00:18:37,00:18:39,He was part of that team.
00:18:39,00:18:40,- So not a writer?
00:18:40,00:18:40,- Was he a boxer?
00:18:40,00:18:43,'Cause Bob Hope was a boxer before he was a comedian.
00:18:43,00:18:44,"- He was, but no, he wasn't a boxer."
00:18:44,00:18:47,- Did he point out whenever he met anyone
00:18:47,00:18:48,who had two first names?
00:18:48,00:18:49,(laughing)
00:18:49,00:18:50,"- No, this is--"
00:18:50,00:18:51,"- I could do with one of those guys, James."
00:18:51,00:18:52,- Yeah.
00:18:52,00:18:53,"- I'd love that, yeah, yeah."
00:18:53,00:18:54,"- I feel like you could be one of those guys, Andy."
00:18:54,00:18:56,"- Oh, I dream, you know."
00:18:56,00:18:58,(laughing)
00:18:58,00:19:01,"- What's, somewhat like a, just a personal, you know,"
00:19:01,00:19:03,"assistant, like a backburn or a--"
00:19:03,00:19:06,"- So what Barney McNulty was, was the Q-Card guy."
00:19:06,00:19:08,And everything was written on Q-Cards.
00:19:08,00:19:11,And Barney McNulty is acknowledged
00:19:11,00:19:13,"with having invented Q-Cards, basically."
00:19:13,00:19:17,No one ever delivered monologues on TV before with Q-Cards.
00:19:17,00:19:19,And Barney McNulty was the guy to do this.
00:19:19,00:19:21,"He said doing it was like, it was like a,"
00:19:21,00:19:23,like handling snakes.
00:19:23,00:19:25,You had to work with the rhythm of the comedian.
00:19:25,00:19:27,You had to have the font big enough
00:19:27,00:19:27,and you're writing and so on.
00:19:27,00:19:28,- Like a snake.
00:19:28,00:19:29,- Yeah.
00:19:29,00:19:30,(laughing)
00:19:30,00:19:32,'Cause he said the comedians are wriggling around.
00:19:32,00:19:34,"They're, they're improvising, they're changing."
00:19:34,00:19:35,You don't know where they're gonna go.
00:19:35,00:19:36,It's kind of--
00:19:36,00:19:36,- Like an auto-Q person.
00:19:36,00:19:38,"- Yeah, like a modern day auto-Q person."
00:19:38,00:19:40,- So sometimes the auto-Q can be done too fast
00:19:40,00:19:42,or too slow and the presenter gets in a tangle
00:19:42,00:19:43,and then--
00:19:43,00:19:44,"- Yeah, yeah."
00:19:44,00:19:44,"- Yeah, auto-Qs are boring then."
00:19:44,00:19:45,"It should be called a McNulty, shouldn't it?"
00:19:45,00:19:46,- Yes.
00:19:46,00:19:47,"- The McNulty, yeah."
00:19:47,00:19:49,So McNulty was so important to him.
00:19:49,00:19:50,"Steve Allen, who's another comedian of the time,"
00:19:50,00:19:52,said that he was once at a barbecue.
00:19:52,00:19:53,- Steve Allen.
00:19:53,00:19:54,"- Yep, Steve Allen."
00:19:54,00:19:55,"- Oh, yeah!"
00:19:55,00:19:56,(laughing)
00:19:56,00:19:57,"- Oh, this is, you've uncovered a scene."
00:19:57,00:20:00,(laughing)
00:20:00,00:20:02,"Once, the problem is once you start seeing them,"
00:20:02,00:20:03,you can't stop.
00:20:03,00:20:04,- Yeah.
00:20:04,00:20:04,- Yeah.
00:20:04,00:20:05,I've been this way for years.
00:20:05,00:20:06,(laughing)
00:20:06,00:20:09,So he was at a party at Barbecue with Bob Hope
00:20:09,00:20:12,and Bob came out and suddenly just did an improvised speech
00:20:12,00:20:14,"to all the people, it's nighttime."
00:20:14,00:20:15,"He's, ""Yeah, thank you for coming."""
00:20:15,00:20:17,And he's doing all these jokes.
00:20:17,00:20:18,"And Steve said, he's hearing these jokes"
00:20:18,00:20:20,"and he's thinking, ""This is a pretty worked out monologue,"
00:20:20,00:20:22,"but it's pretty topical."""
00:20:22,00:20:24,"Turns around, he says, ""He notices sitting in the bushes"
00:20:24,00:20:26,"with a flashlight and some cue cards,"
00:20:26,00:20:31,"is McNulty hiding away, giving him the cue cards to do it."""
00:20:31,00:20:33,- So I haven't really said very much in this part
00:20:33,00:20:36,"because I don't really know anything about comedy,"
00:20:36,00:20:38,but I do know a lot about golf.
00:20:38,00:20:39,(laughing)
00:20:39,00:20:41,And Bob Hope used to love golf.
00:20:41,00:20:44,And that's really kind of all I knew about him
00:20:44,00:20:45,is that he was a golfer.
00:20:45,00:20:49,"I read that, you know, Alan Shepard, the astronaut,"
00:20:49,00:20:52,"yeah, he hit a golf ball on the moon."
00:20:52,00:20:54,"And according to Bob Hope, it was his idea."
00:20:54,00:20:55,- No.
00:20:55,00:20:59,"- Yeah, he said that he was once speaking to Alan Shepard"
00:20:59,00:21:01,"and he used to kind of always carry his golf clubs around him,"
00:21:01,00:21:02,kind of just to--
00:21:02,00:21:03,"- That was his thing, he would--"
00:21:03,00:21:06,"- Yeah, and he reckoned that Alan Shepard"
00:21:06,00:21:08,got the inspiration by watching him
00:21:08,00:21:10,swing in his golf club.
00:21:10,00:21:12,He was on the Mike Douglas show
00:21:12,00:21:15,when Tiger Woods first appeared on television
00:21:15,00:21:17,when he was two years old.
00:21:17,00:21:19,So Tiger Woods was a little dot
00:21:19,00:21:20,and he was kind of hitting golf balls
00:21:20,00:21:22,"and everyone was like, look how amazing"
00:21:22,00:21:24,this little kid is at playing golf.
00:21:24,00:21:27,And Bob Hope was on the show when that happened.
00:21:27,00:21:29,So he's there for the start of Tiger Woods.
00:21:29,00:21:33,"And apparently on his first date, he was so nervous,"
00:21:33,00:21:37,he would just sit and draw golf holes on the tablecloth.
00:21:37,00:21:40,And he did it so much that they made him pay for the tablecloth
00:21:40,00:21:42,because he'd draw all these golf holes on it.
00:21:42,00:21:43,"- Oh, that's so great."
00:21:43,00:21:46,- I certainly claim they were golf holes later on.
00:21:46,00:21:47,(all laughing)
00:21:47,00:21:49,"- These, oh, they're--"
00:21:49,00:21:50,"- And Alan Shepard with, of course,"
00:21:50,00:21:52,a job in the Middle Ages.
00:21:52,00:21:56,(all laughing)
00:21:56,00:21:58,"- I thought that was your job on QI, John."
00:21:58,00:21:59,(all laughing)
00:21:59,00:22:01,(upbeat music)
00:22:02,00:22:04,(upbeat music)
00:22:04,00:22:07,"- Okay, it is time for fact number three,"
00:22:07,00:22:08,and that is James.
00:22:08,00:22:13,"- Okay, my fact this week is that the unarmed stick insect"
00:22:13,00:22:15,has an infinite number of arms.
00:22:15,00:22:19,(all laughing)
00:22:19,00:22:21,"- Um, okay."
00:22:21,00:22:22,- So what?
00:22:22,00:22:24,"- I'm not saying anything else, that's it."
00:22:24,00:22:25,"- Why is it, that's it?"
00:22:25,00:22:26,Does it play golf?
00:22:26,00:22:28,(all laughing)
00:22:28,00:22:29,Infinite is a big word.
00:22:29,00:22:29,"- Yeah, that's a big word, I was gonna say that."
00:22:29,00:22:31,"- It's a long word, yeah."
00:22:31,00:22:32,- It's a full eight letters.
00:22:32,00:22:33,- Don't you mean that?
00:22:33,00:22:34,(all laughing)
00:22:34,00:22:37,"- It's, no, the thing is, I would say,"
00:22:37,00:22:39,sticking sets can regrow their limbs.
00:22:39,00:22:40,"- Yeah, right? - Theoretically."
00:22:40,00:22:41,- Theoretically.
00:22:41,00:22:44,"- Theoretically, possibly forever."
00:22:44,00:22:46,"You know, if you keep chopping them off,"
00:22:46,00:22:47,they'll keep growing them.
00:22:47,00:22:49,"- Yeah, the main body doesn't live forever,"
00:22:49,00:22:50,"does it, or does it?"
00:22:50,00:22:51,"- No, no, no."
00:22:51,00:22:53,I think probably we would reach a time limit.
00:22:53,00:22:54,The other thing--
00:22:54,00:22:55,- Like about a week?
00:22:55,00:22:56,"- Well, 'cause they would die,"
00:22:56,00:22:58,but the other problem is they can only do it
00:22:58,00:22:59,when they're young.
00:22:59,00:23:00,- Okay.
00:23:00,00:23:02,- But they could keep doing it and doing it and doing it
00:23:02,00:23:04,if you kept chopping off all the limbs.
00:23:04,00:23:06,"- Yeah, hell of a shock to your juvenile stick insect."
00:23:06,00:23:08,The first time it chops an arm off
00:23:08,00:23:11,"and it doesn't grow back, it thinks, oh no,"
00:23:11,00:23:13,now I'm officially no longer a juvenile.
00:23:13,00:23:14,"- Yeah, it must be."
00:23:14,00:23:15,- 'Cause you must get used to operating
00:23:15,00:23:16,with complete impunity.
00:23:16,00:23:18,"- It's a real coming of age moment, isn't it?"
00:23:18,00:23:19,"- Yes, yeah."
00:23:19,00:23:22,- So they can keep regrowing their arms.
00:23:22,00:23:25,"Another question is, do they have arms or are they legs?"
00:23:25,00:23:26,(all laughing)
00:23:26,00:23:27,- It's called unarmed.
00:23:27,00:23:29,Is there a reason why it's called unarmed?
00:23:29,00:23:31,"- Yeah, because it doesn't have defenses."
00:23:31,00:23:33,"- Yes, it's armed as in weapons."
00:23:33,00:23:35,"- Yeah, to be honest, it's just a silly thing"
00:23:35,00:23:37,'cause I noticed it was called unarmed
00:23:37,00:23:40,and I remembered they could keep regrowing their arms.
00:23:40,00:23:40,"- Yeah, that's so great."
00:23:40,00:23:42,- But I just thought let's talk about stick insects
00:23:42,00:23:44,'cause stick insects are awesome.
00:23:44,00:23:47,"These ones, these unarmed stick insects"
00:23:47,00:23:50,are the most common stick insects found in Britain.
00:23:50,00:23:51,- Are they?
00:23:51,00:23:52,"- Oh, yes they are."
00:23:52,00:23:56,"Because we have no native stick insects in this country,"
00:23:56,00:23:59,but one of them accidentally got brought in some timber
00:23:59,00:24:02,from New Zealand in the 20s.
00:24:02,00:24:02,- Right.
00:24:02,00:24:05,- And they reproduce pathogenically
00:24:05,00:24:07,so they don't need more than one of them
00:24:07,00:24:09,to create more and more and more of them.
00:24:09,00:24:12,- It's really pleasing that it came over in some timber
00:24:12,00:24:15,disguised as a smaller stick in a load of larger sticks.
00:24:15,00:24:16,That's brilliant.
00:24:16,00:24:18,- There was probably a guy at the park
00:24:18,00:24:19,just counting all of these sticks
00:24:19,00:24:21,"and go, we've got one too many."
00:24:21,00:24:23,(all laughing)
00:24:23,00:24:26,So these were discovered in New Zealand in 1955
00:24:26,00:24:30,"by a man who also, like this misnamed animal,"
00:24:30,00:24:32,"is called John Salmon, not a fish."
00:24:32,00:24:33,- That's amazing.
00:24:33,00:24:36,"- But he is responsible for discovering,"
00:24:36,00:24:39,so there's a Wikipedia list of stick insects of New Zealand
00:24:39,00:24:41,of which there are 23.
00:24:41,00:24:44,John Salmon discovered nine of the stick insects of New Zealand.
00:24:44,00:24:45,- Oh yeah.
00:24:45,00:24:48,- You do find the same people come up again and again
00:24:48,00:24:49,when you look at all the different species
00:24:49,00:24:51,"of stick insects, tends to be the same."
00:24:51,00:24:55,"- It's almost if no one else is looking for stick insects,"
00:24:55,00:24:56,right?
00:24:56,00:24:56,Or maybe they're specialized
00:24:56,00:24:57,'cause they're quite hard to see.
00:24:57,00:24:58,- They're so hard.
00:24:58,00:25:01,"So I was reading about leaf insects,"
00:25:01,00:25:03,"which are similar, you know, they look,"
00:25:03,00:25:05,and they are unbelievably realistic leaf insects.
00:25:05,00:25:07,As in they attach to a tree where they look exactly
00:25:07,00:25:10,"like that leaf, and they have little bit and out edges."
00:25:10,00:25:11,So it looks like an insect.
00:25:11,00:25:12,- So amazing.
00:25:12,00:25:16,- But lots of experts on leaf and stick insects
00:25:16,00:25:19,have never seen them in the wild.
00:25:19,00:25:20,It's quite tragic really.
00:25:20,00:25:21,"So there's a guy called Royce Cumming,"
00:25:21,00:25:23,who's a world expert on leaf insects.
00:25:23,00:25:25,He's never seen one in the wild.
00:25:25,00:25:27,- That's amazing.
00:25:27,00:25:28,"- Because what, you know, it's really hard for me."
00:25:28,00:25:30,- 'Cause you can't just check every leaf.
00:25:30,00:25:32,"- Exactly, that's the problem."
00:25:32,00:25:33,That's exactly it.
00:25:33,00:25:35,"- Yeah, it's a nightmare."
00:25:35,00:25:35,If you wanna get a new cell.
00:25:35,00:25:37,"- Stupid, they should have gone for like."
00:25:37,00:25:38,"- Yeah, elephants."
00:25:38,00:25:39,"- Elephants, absolutely."
00:25:39,00:25:42,- Stick insects feature in Maori myth.
00:25:42,00:25:44,"- Yes, right."
00:25:44,00:25:44,- Quite a few times.
00:25:44,00:25:47,And just something I just happened to know
00:25:47,00:25:49,"about Maori, the language,"
00:25:49,00:25:53,"which is the Maori for nuclear warfare,"
00:25:53,00:25:54,is umu pongi pongi.
00:25:54,00:25:56,- Right.
00:25:56,00:25:57,"- You didn't think they would have a word for it,"
00:25:57,00:25:58,but they do.
00:25:58,00:26:00,- Your duolingo is very bold.
00:26:00,00:26:01,You're like a far ranger.
00:26:01,00:26:03,- This is a dictionary.
00:26:03,00:26:05,This is not duolingo.
00:26:05,00:26:06,- Other language apps are available.
00:26:06,00:26:08,"Memorise, et cetera."
00:26:08,00:26:11,- When stick insects feel under threat.
00:26:11,00:26:12,- Oh yeah.
00:26:12,00:26:14,- They will play dead.
00:26:14,00:26:18,"Or be more like a stick than usual, basically."
00:26:18,00:26:21,And I found an insect owning website
00:26:21,00:26:23,which had a problem page.
00:26:23,00:26:24,"And the problem was,"
00:26:24,00:26:27,is my stick insect playing dead or has it died?
00:26:27,00:26:31,- Or is it in fact a twig?
00:26:31,00:26:34,- We used to have stick insects when I was a kid.
00:26:34,00:26:35,Pet and stick insects.
00:26:35,00:26:36,"Yeah, yeah."
00:26:36,00:26:38,"And it is, I mean, they did die,"
00:26:38,00:26:41,"I'm sorry to say, quite regularly."
00:26:41,00:26:42,They didn't live very long.
00:26:42,00:26:44,"I hope that wasn't due to our bad husbandry, but."
00:26:44,00:26:46,- Or did they die very frequently?
00:26:46,00:26:48,- Maybe they were just trying to get themselves thrown out.
00:26:48,00:26:51,"- We usually check, I don't know what your FAQs will say,"
00:26:51,00:26:53,but for us it was usually when there weren't many poos
00:26:53,00:26:55,"for a few days, that was a problem."
00:26:55,00:26:57,- What's a poo look like from a stick insect?
00:26:57,00:26:58,- It's just like a black dot.
00:26:58,00:26:59,"- Right, nice."
00:26:59,00:27:00,- Yeah.
00:27:00,00:27:03,"- Well, this is basically, if they're threatened,"
00:27:03,00:27:05,they fold their legs up and they paralyze themselves
00:27:05,00:27:07,and they often fall off the branch to the foliage.
00:27:07,00:27:09,"But that happens if they get surprised,"
00:27:09,00:27:11,if they face any surprise until they're played dead.
00:27:11,00:27:14,"So you either wait to see if the color has changed,"
00:27:14,00:27:17,'cause that is a sign that they can't do that by themselves.
00:27:17,00:27:20,- Can the leaf insects change color in the autumn?
00:27:20,00:27:21,- I don't think so.
00:27:21,00:27:23,- Okay.
00:27:23,00:27:24,"- And the other thing you can do,"
00:27:24,00:27:25,"there's just a bit of advice,"
00:27:25,00:27:28,"is to stimulate the insect's mouth palps,"
00:27:28,00:27:30,"which are these small organs near the mouth,"
00:27:30,00:27:32,which are incredibly sensitive.
00:27:32,00:27:33,"And if you stimulate those,"
00:27:33,00:27:36,"it will make a sudden movement, 'cause it hates that."
00:27:36,00:27:38,"And if not, it has died."
00:27:38,00:27:42,I'm slightly moved by all these pets and things dying
00:27:42,00:27:46,"because my dad was in the Navy, we never had pets."
00:27:46,00:27:47,"So when the kids were small,"
00:27:47,00:27:50,"we won a goldfish at a fair in Chipping Norton,"
00:27:50,00:27:52,"who was called Chippy, the fish."
00:27:52,00:27:54,I love this little fish
00:27:54,00:27:57,"and it got something wrong with it, swim bladder."
00:27:57,00:27:58,And I was really heartbroken.
00:27:58,00:28:01,"I was very sort of, you know, anxious about it."
00:28:01,00:28:05,And so I used to take it to the local vet
00:28:05,00:28:07,in a bucket in Hammersmith.
00:28:07,00:28:10,"And so I was sitting there in a bucket,"
00:28:10,00:28:14,"this little goldfish in a tiny little thing, fair goldfish."
00:28:14,00:28:15,- Was it on a lead?
00:28:15,00:28:15,No.
00:28:15,00:28:17,(all laughing)
00:28:17,00:28:19,- And all these people would be there with salukis
00:28:19,00:28:23,and parakeets and horses and things like that.
00:28:23,00:28:25,"And the vet's assistant would come out and say,"
00:28:25,00:28:30,"""Mrs. Campbell Rouse and Montmorency, the third?"""
00:28:30,00:28:31,(all laughing)
00:28:31,00:28:33,And so he would get up with an antelope or something.
00:28:33,00:28:34,(all laughing)
00:28:34,00:28:38,"They came to me and she'd go, ""Mr. Lloyd and fish?"""
00:28:38,00:28:39,(all laughing)
00:28:39,00:28:41,"And after about four visits,"
00:28:41,00:28:44,and what he used to do the vet was inject this goldfish
00:28:44,00:28:45,"with something wrong with the swim bladder,"
00:28:45,00:28:47,with the tiniest little hypotermics
00:28:47,00:28:50,"that you've ever seen, about two inches long."
00:28:50,00:28:51,"And after the fourth time he said,"
00:28:51,00:28:55,"""Mr. Lloyd, I'm afraid there's nothing more I can do for fish."
00:28:55,00:28:56,"He's going to take his chances."""
00:28:56,00:28:59,"- Oh, 'cause that is a problem with goldfish, isn't it?"
00:28:59,00:29:02,They get these swim bladder problems
00:29:02,00:29:03,and they'll kind of float to the surface
00:29:03,00:29:05,and sometimes they go upside down.
00:29:05,00:29:07,"And people think that they're dead,"
00:29:07,00:29:08,but actually they're not dead.
00:29:08,00:29:11,"They can be, they can have their swim bladder pricked"
00:29:11,00:29:12,"and they'll come back. - Oh, you're joking."
00:29:12,00:29:15,"- And so people flush the fish down the toilet,"
00:29:15,00:29:16,but they're not actually dead.
00:29:16,00:29:17,They probably don't flush very well either
00:29:17,00:29:20,'cause they are quite buoyant that stage.
00:29:20,00:29:21,"- Oh, no. - Yeah."
00:29:21,00:29:23,- That's terrible. - It's public service.
00:29:23,00:29:24,- Yeah.
00:29:24,00:29:25,- I was just thinking Mr. Lloyd and fish
00:29:25,00:29:26,"is basically this episode, isn't it?"
00:29:26,00:29:29,(all laughing)
00:29:29,00:29:32,- Very good.
00:29:32,00:29:33,"Did you know that some children,"
00:29:33,00:29:35,human children can regenerate fingertips.
00:29:35,00:29:37,"Did you, I was astounded when I first--"
00:29:37,00:29:38,"- Yeah, yeah, yeah, I had heard that."
00:29:38,00:29:40,- And many doctors don't know that
00:29:40,00:29:42,so that they just grow back their fingertips
00:29:42,00:29:43,if you cut them off. - Yeah.
00:29:43,00:29:45,"Up to a certain, it's kind of much like the stick insect."
00:29:45,00:29:47,"You don't wanna, there's a cut off part, isn't it?"
00:29:47,00:29:50,"- And it's under a certain amount of the finger, I think."
00:29:50,00:29:53,"It's not at the base, but it's the top joint."
00:29:53,00:29:54,- Yeah. - Or the fingernail.
00:29:54,00:29:56,"If there's only a tiny bit of the fingernail left,"
00:29:56,00:29:57,the whole rest of it can grow back.
00:29:57,00:30:00,"- Well, so human children have infinite fingers."
00:30:00,00:30:01,- Yes.
00:30:01,00:30:03,"- And it's another, don't try this at home, isn't it?"
00:30:03,00:30:05,(all laughing)
00:30:05,00:30:06,"- Speaking of children,"
00:30:06,00:30:08,have you guys heard of John George Children?
00:30:08,00:30:10,(all laughing)
00:30:10,00:30:10,- No.
00:30:10,00:30:14,- He was a famous entomologist of the early 19th century.
00:30:14,00:30:17,"And there's a stick insect called children's stick insect,"
00:30:17,00:30:19,which is named after him.
00:30:19,00:30:21,- No. - Yeah.
00:30:21,00:30:22,"He was a, as well as an entomologist,"
00:30:22,00:30:24,he was a biologist.
00:30:24,00:30:26,"And one amazing thing he did, in 1815,"
00:30:26,00:30:29,he traveled to the battlefield of Waterloo
00:30:29,00:30:31,just after the battle.
00:30:31,00:30:33,And he purchased a tree
00:30:33,00:30:36,under which the Duke of Wellington had made his headquarters.
00:30:36,00:30:39,"And so he, basically what had happened was,"
00:30:39,00:30:41,the battle had happened and everyone had gone away
00:30:41,00:30:43,and loads of souvenir hunters were going in
00:30:43,00:30:45,and sort of chopping bits off this tree.
00:30:45,00:30:47,But he actually went and bought the entire tree
00:30:47,00:30:51,"and had it made into furniture by Chippendale,"
00:30:51,00:30:52,Thomas Chippendale.
00:30:52,00:30:53,- Wow. - Wow.
00:30:53,00:30:54,- Isn't that amazing?
00:30:54,00:30:55,- Was it called a Waterloo tree?
00:30:55,00:30:56,"Was that, what is that thing?"
00:30:56,00:30:58,"- It was called the Elm, Waterloo Elm."
00:30:58,00:30:59,- Waterloo Elm. - Yeah.
00:30:59,00:31:00,"- That is, wow."
00:31:00,00:31:02,- And I thought I'd see if John George Children
00:31:02,00:31:06,had any children and he did.
00:31:06,00:31:08,He had a daughter called Anna Atkins.
00:31:08,00:31:12,"And she was the first person, we think, possibly,"
00:31:12,00:31:15,to publish a book illustrated with photographic images.
00:31:15,00:31:19,"She was a friend of Fox Talbot,"
00:31:19,00:31:22,who made one of the first cameras.
00:31:22,00:31:26,"And she made a book in 1843, which had photos in it."
00:31:26,00:31:28,Can you guess what the book was about?
00:31:28,00:31:31,First ever book with photos in it.
00:31:31,00:31:32,"- Insects, the Battle of Waterloo."
00:31:32,00:31:34,- It's gonna be third of something.
00:31:34,00:31:37,"- Something slow-moving, tortoises, twigs."
00:31:37,00:31:38,- Twigs.
00:31:38,00:31:39,"- Children, children."
00:31:39,00:31:41,"- Children, no, it was something very slow-moving."
00:31:41,00:31:44,"- Oh, tortoises, tortoises."
00:31:44,00:31:45,- Rivers.
00:31:45,00:31:47,- It was very leisurely rivers.
00:31:47,00:31:49,- Meandering river.
00:31:49,00:31:51,"- Yeah, something slow-moving, slugs."
00:31:51,00:31:52,- Smaller.
00:31:52,00:31:54,- The big book of slug photos.
00:31:54,00:31:55,"Smaller than the slugs, lobsters."
00:31:55,00:31:56,"No, no, that's not small."
00:31:56,00:31:57,"- No, they're bigger than the slugs."
00:31:57,00:31:58,- Smaller than the slugs.
00:31:58,00:31:59,"- Yeah, the rapids."
00:31:59,00:32:01,"- The snail, is that smaller?"
00:32:01,00:32:02,- That's about the same size.
00:32:02,00:32:03,"- Oh, come on."
00:32:03,00:32:05,"- I mean, much smaller than a slug."
00:32:05,00:32:06,"- Oh, worms, tiny worms."
00:32:06,00:32:07,- Smaller.
00:32:07,00:32:09,- Smaller than the worms.
00:32:09,00:32:11,"Parasitic wasps, they're tiny, tiny, tiny."
00:32:11,00:32:13,- I think a bit bigger than that.
00:32:13,00:32:14,I'll tell you.
00:32:14,00:32:15,"- Well, there's water bears."
00:32:15,00:32:16,- Tartigrades.
00:32:16,00:32:16,- Tartigrades.
00:32:16,00:32:17,- Tartigrades.
00:32:17,00:32:18,- The big book of Tartigrade photos.
00:32:18,00:32:20,That was the first ever.
00:32:20,00:32:21,"- Yeah, was of a Tartigrade."
00:32:21,00:32:23,"No, it was of algae."
00:32:23,00:32:28,"Her book was called Photographs of British Algae,"
00:32:28,00:32:30,Cyanotype Impressions.
00:32:30,00:32:32,"And it came out in October, 1843."
00:32:32,00:32:33,And that was the first ever book
00:32:33,00:32:35,illustrated with photographic images.
00:32:35,00:32:36,- It's very nice.
00:32:36,00:32:37,- I'm still recovering.
00:32:37,00:32:38,"- Me too, I was about to say--"
00:32:38,00:32:39,- It's still recovering from that thrilling--
00:32:39,00:32:40,"- I was about to say, you look great."
00:32:40,00:32:42,- How these quizzes really get you
00:32:42,00:32:43,feeling like you're doing exercise.
00:32:43,00:32:45,- They pump me up.
00:32:45,00:32:47,"These things are always so,"
00:32:47,00:32:49,"when you do these dives into things,"
00:32:49,00:32:51,"like regeneration, for example,"
00:32:51,00:32:52,"it's so miraculous, isn't it?"
00:32:52,00:32:54,And all the creatures that can
00:32:54,00:32:57,axolotls and salamanders and sharks
00:32:57,00:33:00,regenerate teeth all the time.
00:33:00,00:33:04,And cockroaches can grow new legs.
00:33:04,00:33:04,Did you know that?
00:33:04,00:33:06,- No.
00:33:06,00:33:09,- And cockroaches have got a bigger genome than people.
00:33:09,00:33:10,- Okay.
00:33:10,00:33:13,"- And they taste inside,"
00:33:13,00:33:15,the innards of a cockroach.
00:33:15,00:33:17,Tastes like blue cheese.
00:33:17,00:33:17,- Really?
00:33:17,00:33:18,"- Amazing, yeah."
00:33:18,00:33:21,"And axolotls, they've got 30 billion base pairs"
00:33:21,00:33:22,in their genome.
00:33:22,00:33:24,That's 10 times as much as we have.
00:33:24,00:33:25,- Wow.
00:33:25,00:33:27,- Do you think that guy who was selling axolotls
00:33:27,00:33:28,in your shop only had one of them?
00:33:28,00:33:30,"And he kept selling it, but keeping a leg,"
00:33:30,00:33:33,so that it would regenerate to a new one.
00:33:33,00:33:36,- What a brilliant business model.
00:33:36,00:33:38,- That's how I'm thinking.
00:33:38,00:33:40,"- They're also, the axolotl gets its name"
00:33:40,00:33:43,from the name of Quetzalcoatl's dog.
00:33:43,00:33:44,- Does it?
00:33:44,00:33:45,"- Yeah, Quetzalcoatl had a dog called axolotl."
00:33:45,00:33:47,"- Did he think when he went to the vet,"
00:33:47,00:33:49,it was Quetzalcoatl and axolotl?
00:33:49,00:33:52,"- Unarmed stick insects,"
00:33:52,00:33:54,obviously a badly named insect.
00:33:54,00:33:55,"- Oh, yeah."
00:33:55,00:33:57,"- And I just want to mention one I found the other day,"
00:33:57,00:33:59,which is the so-called whispering bat.
00:33:59,00:34:02,The so-called whispering bat's call
00:34:02,00:34:05,is as loud as a chainsaw or a leaf blower.
00:34:05,00:34:06,- Wow.
00:34:06,00:34:08,(all laughing)
00:34:08,00:34:10,- But the reason it's called the whispering bat
00:34:10,00:34:12,is because it's too high-pitched for us to hear.
00:34:12,00:34:13,"Oh, thank God."
00:34:13,00:34:15,Other bats find it deafening.
00:34:15,00:34:16,"- Yeah, right."
00:34:16,00:34:17,- That's funny.
00:34:17,00:34:18,- There's so many classic animals
00:34:18,00:34:20,that are completely misnamed.
00:34:20,00:34:23,"So, a few that I found electric eel."
00:34:23,00:34:24,- Yes.
00:34:24,00:34:25,- Not an eel.
00:34:25,00:34:26,- No.
00:34:26,00:34:27,- It's a knife fish.
00:34:27,00:34:29,The horny toad.
00:34:29,00:34:30,"- Yep, lizard."
00:34:30,00:34:31,- It's a lizard.
00:34:31,00:34:32,- Doesn't have much sex.
00:34:32,00:34:33,- Doesn't have much sex.
00:34:33,00:34:34,- Very sad.
00:34:34,00:34:35,- King Cobra's.
00:34:35,00:34:35,- Not.
00:34:35,00:34:36,- Not Royals.
00:34:36,00:34:38,(all laughing)
00:34:38,00:34:39,- Not Cobra's.
00:34:39,00:34:40,"- No, really?"
00:34:40,00:34:41,"- Oh, Cobra's."
00:34:41,00:34:42,"- Wow, skipjack tuner, not a tuner."
00:34:42,00:34:43,- Really?
00:34:43,00:34:44,- Is it really?
00:34:44,00:34:45,"- That's the one that's always on all the tins, isn't it?"
00:34:45,00:34:46,It's not tuner.
00:34:46,00:34:47,It's a completely different genus.
00:34:47,00:34:48,- Really?
00:34:48,00:34:49,Huh.
00:34:49,00:34:50,- Mountain goat?
00:34:50,00:34:51,Not a mountain.
00:34:51,00:34:53,"No, not a goat."
00:34:53,00:34:53,- Really?
00:34:53,00:34:54,- What?
00:34:54,00:34:55,- No.
00:34:55,00:34:56,- The list goes on.
00:34:56,00:34:57,"- Yeah, it does, actually."
00:34:57,00:34:59,"Mantis shrimp, neither a shrimp nor a mantis."
00:34:59,00:35:01,American buffalo's not a buffalo but a bison.
00:35:01,00:35:04,Do you know the difference between a buffalo and a bison?
00:35:04,00:35:05,"- No, I don't, Mr. Hope."
00:35:05,00:35:07,(all laughing)
00:35:07,00:35:08,- You can't wash your hands on a buffalo.
00:35:08,00:35:11,(all laughing)
00:35:11,00:35:17,"- Okay, it is time for our final fact of the show,"
00:35:17,00:35:19,and that is loedy.
00:35:20,00:35:23,"So, I still have to decide which fact to give to you,"
00:35:23,00:35:25,and I just want to give you some
00:35:25,00:35:27,that I didn't choose in the end.
00:35:27,00:35:28,(all laughing)
00:35:28,00:35:29,- That was a first.
00:35:29,00:35:30,- 'Cause I don't want to waste them.
00:35:30,00:35:33,"To keep warm in the 16th and 17th centuries,"
00:35:33,00:35:37,boys at British public schools burned the furniture.
00:35:37,00:35:39,"Horrible, a bit like my school."
00:35:39,00:35:40,"John Denver's wife, Annie,"
00:35:40,00:35:42,claimed to have fallen in love with him
00:35:42,00:35:45,"despite his songs, not because of them."
00:35:45,00:35:46,That's very sad.
00:35:46,00:35:49,"And Toad Suck, Arkansas, recently won a survey"
00:35:49,00:35:51,"to find America's most unfortunate place name,"
00:35:51,00:35:53,"beating Belchartown, Massachusetts,"
00:35:53,00:35:56,"Climax, Georgia, Hooker, Oklahoma,"
00:35:56,00:35:58,"and Rochetown, Illinois."
00:35:58,00:36:00,"- Well, I'm glad that you didn't do that low-brow one, John."
00:36:00,00:36:02,(all laughing)
00:36:02,00:36:04,What is your actual fact this week?
00:36:04,00:36:08,"- My fact is, 45% of Britons do not know"
00:36:08,00:36:10,where their rectum is.
00:36:10,00:36:13,(all laughing)
00:36:13,00:36:15,"Now, this was according to a poll"
00:36:15,00:36:18,"of 2,000 British adults."
00:36:19,00:36:22,Commissioned by Powell Mell Medical Private Health Care
00:36:22,00:36:24,"in January, 2023."
00:36:24,00:36:27,Only 55% of men and women in Britain
00:36:27,00:36:30,can confidently state where their rectum is.
00:36:30,00:36:34,And only 50% know where their reproductive organs are.
00:36:34,00:36:36,- No. - That is impossible.
00:36:36,00:36:38,"Now, I can sort of understand why this might be"
00:36:38,00:36:40,"because they don't know what the words mean,"
00:36:40,00:36:42,rectum and reproductive organs.
00:36:42,00:36:44,"But according to the survey also,"
00:36:44,00:36:46,an astonishing 37% of Brits
00:36:46,00:36:50,cannot say where either their heart or their brain is.
00:36:50,00:36:52,(all laughing)
00:36:52,00:36:54,"- Well, my brain isn't my reproductive system."
00:36:54,00:36:57,(all laughing)
00:36:57,00:36:58,"- 'Cause there's that saying, isn't there?"
00:36:58,00:37:01,"He couldn't find his ass with both hands, yes."
00:37:01,00:37:04,And what we're saying is that 45% of British people
00:37:04,00:37:05,fall into that. - I don't think we're saying that
00:37:05,00:37:08,because to find your rectum with your hands
00:37:08,00:37:09,is quite an invasive thing.
00:37:09,00:37:11,(all laughing)
00:37:11,00:37:13,"- Well, I did look it up because I thought,"
00:37:13,00:37:15,"okay, well, that's how ridiculous that is."
00:37:15,00:37:18,But I didn't know until yesterday
00:37:18,00:37:19,"which part of the rectum is,"
00:37:19,00:37:21,"but you know, you've all looked that up."
00:37:21,00:37:23,So it's not actually what you think.
00:37:23,00:37:25,It's not the anus. - Not the heart.
00:37:25,00:37:29,"- It's in, there's the anal canal with the anus on one end"
00:37:29,00:37:30,"and then the other end is the rectum,"
00:37:30,00:37:31,which is basically the poo park
00:37:31,00:37:34,where the stuff that comes down the colon
00:37:34,00:37:35,is being digested all the way
00:37:35,00:37:36,"and then it goes into the rectum,"
00:37:36,00:37:38,"which is exactly, it's the storage thing."
00:37:38,00:37:39,- Right. - Until--
00:37:39,00:37:41,"- Is that a medical term, the poo park?"
00:37:41,00:37:43,(all laughing)
00:37:43,00:37:46,"- Yeah, same with vagina, I think, as well."
00:37:46,00:37:48,"Like people think it's the opening,"
00:37:48,00:37:50,but it's the tube. - Yes.
00:37:50,00:37:51,- So that's interesting.
00:37:51,00:37:53,I thought the rectum was connected
00:37:53,00:37:55,from sort of the bottom of the intestine
00:37:55,00:37:57,right to the opening. - No.
00:37:57,00:37:58,- I thought that whole thing--
00:37:58,00:38:00,"- Okay, we've got this, we've covered them."
00:38:00,00:38:03,- Count me as one of the 55.
00:38:03,00:38:04,- The interesting thing about this survey was
00:38:04,00:38:06,"it wasn't testing, can you find this?"
00:38:06,00:38:07,"It was saying, are you confident"
00:38:07,00:38:10,that you could locate where organ X is?
00:38:10,00:38:11,- That's interesting.
00:38:11,00:38:13,So an 8% of people said they could confidently
00:38:13,00:38:14,identify none of them.
00:38:14,00:38:15,- None of them?
00:38:15,00:38:17,"- They just said no, I couldn't identify any."
00:38:17,00:38:19,"- But surely the brain, everybody must know."
00:38:19,00:38:20,"- You would think so, yeah."
00:38:20,00:38:22,- That's just people with no confidence.
00:38:22,00:38:24,"- Exactly. - Yeah, it's a confidence thing."
00:38:24,00:38:25,- Although we have said before
00:38:25,00:38:27,"that there is this thing in,"
00:38:27,00:38:30,"is it called Lizardman's Constant or something like that,"
00:38:30,00:38:33,"where in any survey, you will get a percent"
00:38:33,00:38:35,who will just give a ridiculous answer.
00:38:35,00:38:37,"- I did wonder whether people,"
00:38:37,00:38:39,"because it was an online survey,"
00:38:39,00:38:41,it wasn't a person asking my eye to eye.
00:38:41,00:38:43,"So you wonder, people had a bit too much to drink,"
00:38:43,00:38:44,"they think, oh, I'll just put."
00:38:44,00:38:45,- Yeah.
00:38:45,00:38:46,- But there was another thing at the other end
00:38:46,00:38:48,"of the spectrum on this survey,"
00:38:48,00:38:50,"'cause you know, people not identifying"
00:38:50,00:38:52,where their brain is sounds mad.
00:38:52,00:38:54,I also would like to call a slight doubt
00:38:54,00:38:57,"over the 24% of people, quite high,"
00:38:57,00:38:59,who claimed they could confidently identify
00:38:59,00:39:01,where their pancreas was.
00:39:01,00:39:04,"- Oh no. - And I think, come on."
00:39:04,00:39:06,"- Like, I know it's in the middle section, but."
00:39:06,00:39:08,"- Yeah, yeah, but where?"
00:39:08,00:39:10,"- Well, like the spleen, that was the one,"
00:39:10,00:39:12,20% claimed to know where their spleen was.
00:39:12,00:39:15,"I wouldn't have any idea, would give me a break."
00:39:15,00:39:17,"- Yeah, 20% are not spleen doctors."
00:39:17,00:39:19,"What's the term, I don't know."
00:39:19,00:39:20,- Splenologists?
00:39:20,00:39:22,- What's a speleologist?
00:39:22,00:39:23,- That's a screwdriver.
00:39:23,00:39:25,"- Oh no, that's been a terrible mistake."
00:39:25,00:39:28,"- Don't worry, he's gonna carry out the operation anyway."
00:39:28,00:39:30,"He says it'll be just like a cave, probably."
00:39:30,00:39:32,- He's never been in an anal canal before.
00:39:32,00:39:34,- I tend to do a lot of these things now
00:39:34,00:39:37,when I'm trying to get access to a news article online.
00:39:37,00:39:40,"- They often, a lot of websites will have like,"
00:39:40,00:39:42,just fill this quick survey in quickly and.
00:39:42,00:39:44,- See the way your rectum is.
00:39:44,00:39:45,- Yeah.
00:39:45,00:39:47,- What kind of websites are you trying to get onto then?
00:39:47,00:39:49,- Please turn on your webcam.
00:39:49,00:39:53,Show us your rectum.
00:39:53,00:39:55,- I find it interesting that don't knows
00:39:55,00:39:56,in surveys as well.
00:39:56,00:39:59,And so YouGov always include their don't knows.
00:39:59,00:40:00,And there was an article about this in Wired
00:40:00,00:40:03,a few years ago by a writer called Amit Katwala.
00:40:03,00:40:04,And it's a great point 'cause YouGov
00:40:04,00:40:06,"did a survey about surfing, right?"
00:40:06,00:40:09,Have you ever been surfing or not?
00:40:09,00:40:12,"In which 3% of people said, ""I don't know."""
00:40:12,00:40:16,And it's a big thing to not know if you've tried surfing.
00:40:16,00:40:19,2% don't know if they've lived in London.
00:40:19,00:40:20,(laughing)
00:40:20,00:40:22,- They could be on the outskirts.
00:40:22,00:40:24,"- Possible, yeah, I guess, yeah."
00:40:24,00:40:25,- All born in London but left straight away.
00:40:25,00:40:27,"Oh, I don't know if we've lived there for a couple of months."
00:40:27,00:40:29,"- Okay, here's one from 2023."
00:40:29,00:40:31,Do you and your romantic partner each have your own side
00:40:31,00:40:33,"of the bed that you sleep on, okay?"
00:40:33,00:40:35,"And if you don't currently have a partner,"
00:40:35,00:40:36,please think about the last partner you have.
00:40:36,00:40:38,77% we each have our own side.
00:40:38,00:40:42,"4% chaotic, we sleep on whichever side, absolutely insane."
00:40:42,00:40:44,But 6% don't know.
00:40:44,00:40:45,- Yeah.
00:40:45,00:40:46,- How do you not know?
00:40:46,00:40:47,- I would say it would be different depending
00:40:47,00:40:49,on which bed you're sleeping in.
00:40:49,00:40:51,"Like in our home bed, we sleep on the same size."
00:40:51,00:40:53,But if you go to a hotel.
00:40:53,00:40:54,- Then it's anything goes.
00:40:54,00:40:55,Completely. - Exactly.
00:40:55,00:40:57,"Well, it's not, it's whatever my wife wants to do."
00:40:57,00:40:59,(laughing)
00:40:59,00:41:02,"- In 2017, a survey found that half of British gardeners"
00:41:02,00:41:05,cannot name a single shrub.
00:41:05,00:41:08,"And the next year in 2018, a poll found that 80% of Britons"
00:41:08,00:41:11,couldn't pick out their own neighbors in a police lineup.
00:41:11,00:41:13,I thought that was quite strong.
00:41:13,00:41:14,- That's interesting.
00:41:14,00:41:15,- And how did they test that?
00:41:15,00:41:17,Did they do some lineups?
00:41:17,00:41:18,"I'd like to know that, yes."
00:41:18,00:41:19,- That'd be great.
00:41:19,00:41:21,"- It wasn't a Daily Mail, though, so maybe it's..."
00:41:21,00:41:22,- Can you name a shrub?
00:41:22,00:41:24,"'Cause I think shrub,"
00:41:24,00:41:27,is that like a specific type of plant is a shrub?
00:41:27,00:41:30,"- I agree, I mean, I garden, and you know."
00:41:30,00:41:31,"- I have something that looks like a shrub,"
00:41:31,00:41:34,"which is Nazalia, is that a shrub?"
00:41:34,00:41:35,- I don't know.
00:41:35,00:41:38,"- Is it a little Leylandi bush, a shrub?"
00:41:38,00:41:39,"- A bush is a part of the body, isn't it?"
00:41:39,00:41:40,I think that...
00:41:40,00:41:41,(laughing)
00:41:41,00:41:43,- Most people don't know why that is.
00:41:43,00:41:44,- I don't know where their bush is.
00:41:44,00:41:46,(laughing)
00:41:46,00:41:48,"- Well, let's think of a shrub, it must be a shrub."
00:41:48,00:41:50,"Is it a laurel, is that a tree?"
00:41:50,00:41:51,"- I think that's a shrub, is it?"
00:41:51,00:41:52,"- I think it's a size thing, isn't it?"
00:41:52,00:41:54,"Over a certain size, a shrub becomes a tree."
00:41:54,00:41:56,- I think we've shown that this is a very difficult thing
00:41:56,00:41:57,to know.
00:41:57,00:41:58,(laughing)
00:41:58,00:41:59,"- We always jump when you're on the show,"
00:41:59,00:42:01,we get into the deep questions.
00:42:01,00:42:02,(laughing)
00:42:02,00:42:04,- Can I do one more survey?
00:42:04,00:42:05,"- Just this is a silly survey,"
00:42:05,00:42:07,"it's not really that much on topic,"
00:42:07,00:42:09,but there was a poll quite recently
00:42:09,00:42:13,"about what Britons aged 18 to 29,"
00:42:13,00:42:15,so this is young people according to the survey.
00:42:15,00:42:19,What is the least cool hand gesture a person can make?
00:42:19,00:42:21,"- Oh, that's great! - Just that it's a good quiz."
00:42:21,00:42:22,"- Yeah, okay, cool."
00:42:22,00:42:23,"- Okay, can I have a punt?"
00:42:23,00:42:24,"- Yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:42:24,00:42:27,- I think the peace sign is not cool.
00:42:27,00:42:29,"- Oh, do you know, I do that all the time."
00:42:29,00:42:30,"- I do it all the time, but I just don't,"
00:42:30,00:42:31,I don't think it's cool.
00:42:31,00:42:32,"- Oh, okay."
00:42:32,00:42:34,"- Possibly the horns, the rock horns."
00:42:34,00:42:38,"- Oh, that's like a cuckold in Southern Europe."
00:42:38,00:42:38,"- Oh, yeah."
00:42:38,00:42:39,(laughing)
00:42:39,00:42:40,"- No, it's not that."
00:42:40,00:42:42,"- Careful at Southern European Metallica gigs,"
00:42:42,00:42:43,"which I know you love to go to, Dan."
00:42:43,00:42:45,(laughing)
00:42:45,00:42:46,- The thumbs up.
00:42:46,00:42:47,- The thumbs up.
00:42:47,00:42:49,"- Thumbs up, that was in the poll."
00:42:49,00:42:50,"It wasn't the worst,"
00:42:50,00:42:52,but a lot of people thought it was quite cringe.
00:42:52,00:42:53,- A-okay.
00:42:53,00:42:54,"- That was cringe, but not the worst."
00:42:54,00:42:55,"- The phone, call me."
00:42:55,00:42:57,"- In fact, the double A-okay"
00:42:57,00:42:59,is one of the most cringe-worthy signs.
00:42:59,00:43:00,"- Oh, air quotes!"
00:43:00,00:43:01,Are they the--
00:43:01,00:43:02,"- Yeah, that's pretty good."
00:43:02,00:43:03,- The most now.
00:43:03,00:43:04,"- I actually think if anyone had thought of that,"
00:43:04,00:43:06,they would have gone for it.
00:43:06,00:43:07,"Hey, John, do you want to have a guess or?"
00:43:07,00:43:08,- Wankings.
00:43:08,00:43:10,"- Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:43:10,00:43:12,"- Sorry, Philippa Perry."
00:43:12,00:43:14,"She basically answered the word ""wank"""
00:43:14,00:43:16,for every question we asked her as she came on the show.
00:43:16,00:43:19,(laughing)
00:43:19,00:43:22,"It is, and this is 38% of people said this."
00:43:22,00:43:25,It's playing an air guitar.
00:43:25,00:43:26,- Oh!
00:43:26,00:43:28,- Like a Wild Stallions' Bill and Ted thing.
00:43:28,00:43:29,- That is pretty embarrassing.
00:43:29,00:43:30,"- Oh, come on, it's cool."
00:43:30,00:43:31,(laughing)
00:43:31,00:43:32,- Okay.
00:43:32,00:43:33,"- How old are you, Dad?"
00:43:33,00:43:34,(laughing)
00:43:34,00:43:37,"- The right age, to know that's cool."
00:43:37,00:43:39,Rectum?
00:43:39,00:43:41,"- Okay, let's talk rectums."
00:43:41,00:43:44,The US Consumer Product Safety Commission every year
00:43:44,00:43:46,do a list of things that have been found
00:43:46,00:43:48,in people's orifices.
00:43:48,00:43:49,- Really?
00:43:49,00:43:53,"- Yeah, the 2022 list include a monopoly piece,"
00:43:53,00:43:57,"a reusable ice pack, a fishing pole."
00:43:57,00:43:57,- No.
00:43:57,00:43:58,(laughing)
00:43:58,00:44:00,- It can't have been the entire pole.
00:44:00,00:44:01,"- Well, they're collapsible, aren't they?"
00:44:01,00:44:02,"- They collapse, yeah."
00:44:02,00:44:02,"- Oh, do they?"
