00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580
 (upbeat music)

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:17.260
 - Hello and welcome to another episode

00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:20.500
 of No Such Thing as a Fish, a weekly podcast coming to you

00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:24.260
 for the first time from the new QI offices in Hoburn.

00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:25.420
 My name is Dan Schreiber.

00:00:25.420 --> 00:00:27.620
 I am sitting here with Andrew Hunter Murray,

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:30.680
 James Harkin and here to cut the red ribbon

00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:33.820
 and officially open the new Fish podcasting headquarters

00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:36.440
 is the founder of QI himself, John Lloyd.

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:38.960
 And once again, we have gathered around the microphones

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:41.560
 with our four favorite facts from the last seven days.

00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:44.600
 And in no particular order, here we go.

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:48.040
 Starting with fact number one, that is Andy.

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:50.840
 My fact is that there was a job in medieval times

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:52.740
 called the municipal swine herd

00:00:52.740 --> 00:00:56.120
 who was effectively a professional pig walker for city dwellers

00:00:56.120 --> 00:00:58.440
 who didn't want to walk their own pigs.

00:00:58.440 --> 00:00:59.280
 - Right.

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:01.780
 (laughing)

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:03.880
 - It's just a job that you used to be able to get.

00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:05.000
 Before we go any further, actually,

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:06.880
 I should say this fact was sent in to us

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:11.120
 at podcast@qi.com by a listener sent in by Andrew Salamone.

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:13.200
 So thank you very much indeed for it, Andrew.

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:14.800
 - Were they on leashes?

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:16.920
 - No, I don't think they were.

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:19.280
 - That's a more difficult job than I reckon

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:22.320
 'cause you're corraling the pigs as well as walking them.

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:23.400
 - It's difficult in that way,

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:24.320
 but it's also very hard.

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:25.680
 I imagine to keep a pig on a leash

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:26.640
 if it doesn't want to be.

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:27.480
 - Is it?

00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:28.320
 - Really?

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:29.160
 The pigs are very strong.

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:31.640
 - But they're also very intelligent and can be trained.

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:33.200
 You can teach a pig to dance.

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:34.160
 - No, you're right.

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:36.400
 Well, yeah, I don't think they were.

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:38.120
 This was in the middle ages.

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:39.400
 - Sorry, John, can I just pick you up on,

00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:41.560
 you can teach a pig to dance?

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:42.800
 - Yeah, well, they're very intelligent.

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:43.720
 (laughing)

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:46.100
 They're right at the top of the animal league,

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:48.240
 smarter than dogs, sheep, and horses.

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:50.800
 They can be house trained, taught to fetch, come to heal.

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:53.440
 They can pull carts, they can sniff out landmines.

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:55.600
 - But can I bring you back to the dancing point?

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:56.680
 Pigs can dance.

00:01:56.680 --> 00:01:58.240
 - Apparently they can, yes.

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:00.600
 - Were they sort of like vaudeville acts or?

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:01.920
 - It's mainly flamenco dancing.

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:03.920
 (laughing)

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:06.720
 They'd click their little heels together like castanets.

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:07.560
 - Brilliant.

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:09.200
 - They like watching television.

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:11.600
 They have their own favorite programs, pet pigs.

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:12.520
 - Peppa Pig?

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:14.240
 - I don't know if Peppa Pig can watch television.

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:15.640
 - No, I was wondering if Peppa Pig

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:17.440
 was one of their favorite TV shows.

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:18.440
 - I'm sorry to be late to this,

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:20.920
 but the Fox Trotter would be an example

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:21.760
 of a dancer pig could do.

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:24.880
 - And Southpawk would be a TV show they might like.

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:25.720
 - There we go.

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:26.560
 - Southpawk.

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:27.600
 (laughing)

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:29.400
 - Should we stragg us away from this one?

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:30.240
 - Oh yeah, sorry, yeah, yeah.

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:32.800
 Back into the middle late as we go, hooray.

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:36.040
 So these are the first professional pig husbands,

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:37.720
 I guess you would call them in Europe.

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:39.000
 They were these village swine herds,

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:42.000
 and it was in a time when everyone had their own pig.

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.280
 A pig was an amazingly useful thing to have.

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:46.840
 It was a waste disposal unit,

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:49.280
 but it was a waste disposal unit made of pork.

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:50.640
 What a delicious--

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:51.840
 - Go into that a bit more?

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:54.160
 - You feed it leftovers and scraps from the household,

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:55.960
 and then when winter comes, you eat the pig.

00:02:55.960 --> 00:02:57.760
 - It's like if you can eat your wheely bin.

00:02:57.760 --> 00:02:59.360
 - Yeah, 'cause no, in the Flintstones,

00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:02.240
 that's what they, the trash is a dinosaur

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:04.400
 that eats the trash sitting in a drawer.

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:05.240
 So it's kind of like that.

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:07.000
 - It's probably based on these academic studies

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:09.920
 of medieval municipal swine herds, yeah.

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:12.040
 And there was a pig daycare thing, though,

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:14.760
 because you didn't want to look after your own pig all day,

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:18.000
 being a busy middle-class peasant in the middle ages,

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:20.360
 and you would have a village swine herd

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:24.360
 who was rewarded with a sucking pig each year

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:27.480
 and the entrails of any animal which had been slaughtered.

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:28.320
 So--

00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:29.680
 - What did the sucking pig actually do,

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:31.200
 or is that a vulgar question?

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:32.560
 (laughing)

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:34.560
 - You said they could be trained to do anything, John,

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:35.400
 is that it?

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:37.640
 (laughing)

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:39.640
 - But they are party animals pigs.

00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:44.400
 Some pig farmers keep lights on in the sky at night.

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:46.040
 When the farmers go home at the end of the day,

00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:47.160
 the pigs don't settle down,

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:50.040
 they start eating, drinking, and having fun for small hours.

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:52.400
 That's actually their favorite show this day at night.

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:55.280
 (laughing)

00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:58.720
 Actually, I read one cool thing about lights in pigsties,

00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:02.120
 and that is to get rid of the smell in pigsties,

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:05.200
 you can paint it with titanium oxide paint

00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:07.840
 and then fire UV light at the paint,

00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:10.320
 and that will somehow break down the chemicals,

00:04:10.320 --> 00:04:11.880
 which will stop it from smelling.

00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:14.040
 And it's even better if you put a disco ball

00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:15.320
 in the middle of the pigstie,

00:04:15.320 --> 00:04:18.520
 it will fire the UV light out in all different directions

00:04:18.520 --> 00:04:21.480
 and it will make it smell better more quickly.

00:04:21.480 --> 00:04:23.080
 - And you know why the disco ball's there

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:23.920
 because of the dance?

00:04:23.920 --> 00:04:25.080
 - Yes, exactly.

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:28.000
 (laughing)

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:31.880
 - Medieval pigs don't look like our modern day pig,

00:04:31.880 --> 00:04:35.040
 and this is something that has led to a lot of annoyance

00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:36.160
 in the world of academia,

00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:38.080
 because a lot of medieval scholars

00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:39.520
 are constantly finding themselves,

00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:42.080
 I say constantly, it's one guy as far as I can find,

00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:43.960
 being pissed off by their representation

00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:46.120
 within video games these days.

00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:48.880
 So there's a lot of video games like Assassin's Creed,

00:04:48.880 --> 00:04:51.800
 Valhalla, there's Medieval Dynasty Foundation,

00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:54.240
 where they represent pigs as a modern day pig,

00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:55.480
 it's pink and it's hairless,

00:04:55.480 --> 00:04:57.080
 it looks nothing like the pig is today.

00:04:57.080 --> 00:04:58.240
 - Minecraft?

00:04:58.240 --> 00:04:59.080
 - Maybe in Minecraft.

00:04:59.080 --> 00:04:59.920
 - There are pigs in Minecraft?

00:04:59.920 --> 00:05:01.000
 - Minecraft, yeah.

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:03.520
 (laughing)

00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:05.520
 And so actually of the time,

00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:08.240
 if we wanna picture an old pig,

00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:11.240
 it's a long legged, they're quite small, long snouts,

00:05:11.240 --> 00:05:14.840
 very lean figure, they had arch-crested backs,

00:05:14.840 --> 00:05:17.640
 and they had long curved tusks as well,

00:05:17.640 --> 00:05:18.880
 according to the academic.

00:05:18.880 --> 00:05:20.680
 - I suppose if you made them look like that

00:05:20.680 --> 00:05:23.040
 in the video game, people might not realise they were pigs.

00:05:23.040 --> 00:05:25.680
 - Yeah, and what you've described as a stalk, basically,

00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:26.720
 as far as I can tell.

00:05:26.720 --> 00:05:29.000
 (laughing)

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:29.840
 - Wow, okay.

00:05:29.840 --> 00:05:31.720
 - But you mentioned Leeds,

00:05:31.720 --> 00:05:34.680
 did you know the thing about Gérard de Neval,

00:05:34.680 --> 00:05:36.480
 the 19th century French poet,

00:05:36.480 --> 00:05:38.960
 who had a pet lobster called Thibault,

00:05:38.960 --> 00:05:41.720
 which used to walk around Paris on a blue silk ribbon,

00:05:41.720 --> 00:05:43.040
 so he did have a lead for the lobster.

00:05:43.040 --> 00:05:44.360
 - He could walk on a lead.

00:05:44.360 --> 00:05:46.080
 - He was asked why he had a lobster as a pet,

00:05:46.080 --> 00:05:48.840
 and he said, "They are peaceful, serious creatures.

00:05:48.840 --> 00:05:51.560
 "They know the secrets of the sea, and they don't bark."

00:05:51.560 --> 00:05:52.920
 And it was a very--

00:05:52.920 --> 00:05:54.920
 - He know the secrets of the sea.

00:05:54.920 --> 00:05:57.280
 - It was a very sedate job, 'cause I checked this out.

00:05:57.280 --> 00:06:00.600
 In lab tests, the maximum recorded walking speed

00:06:00.600 --> 00:06:03.400
 of a lobster is 2.5 metres per minute,

00:06:03.400 --> 00:06:05.680
 or 144 metres an hour.

00:06:05.680 --> 00:06:08.600
 - That's a good easy job, a professional lobster walker.

00:06:08.600 --> 00:06:10.160
 - It feels like at some stage,

00:06:10.160 --> 00:06:12.800
 you would end up dragging a lobster more than walking it,

00:06:12.800 --> 00:06:13.640
 doesn't it?

00:06:13.640 --> 00:06:16.800
 - Maybe you got to get back for lobster dragging.

00:06:16.800 --> 00:06:20.360
 - I did the other day in a big railway station,

00:06:20.360 --> 00:06:22.280
 I saw someone who had a ferret on a lead.

00:06:22.280 --> 00:06:23.120
 That was nice. - Did you?

00:06:23.120 --> 00:06:25.160
 - Yeah, which you do see occasionally.

00:06:25.160 --> 00:06:26.000
 - Yeah. - You know,

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:26.840
 'cause they don't need to be--

00:06:26.840 --> 00:06:27.680
 - So you pull it out of your trousers.

00:06:27.680 --> 00:06:30.480
 (all laughing)

00:06:30.480 --> 00:06:32.760
 - I got sent a picture from my friend Emi in Hong Kong

00:06:32.760 --> 00:06:34.600
 of someone walking a lizard on a lead.

00:06:34.600 --> 00:06:35.760
 - Really? - Like one of those big,

00:06:35.760 --> 00:06:36.600
 big lizards.

00:06:36.600 --> 00:06:37.440
 - What, like a commuter dragon?

00:06:37.440 --> 00:06:38.260
 - Yeah, exactly. - No.

00:06:38.260 --> 00:06:39.100
 - But not a commuter dragon.

00:06:39.100 --> 00:06:41.160
 No, no, no, but like sizeable.

00:06:41.160 --> 00:06:43.440
 - Did a real lizard or a shape-shifting lizard?

00:06:43.440 --> 00:06:44.760
 - It was, yeah, it was one of the members

00:06:44.760 --> 00:06:46.880
 of the Royal Family in Hong Kong.

00:06:46.880 --> 00:06:48.000
 - Monitor, I guess.

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:48.960
 - Yeah, it could be.

00:06:48.960 --> 00:06:50.440
 Yeah.

00:06:50.440 --> 00:06:51.480
 - I went into my local,

00:06:51.480 --> 00:06:55.260
 sorry, no, just bragging about animals we've seen lately,

00:06:55.260 --> 00:06:58.840
 but I went into an aquarium shop the other day.

00:06:58.840 --> 00:06:59.680
 - Ah, yeah.

00:06:59.680 --> 00:07:00.720
 - I was trying to buy some--

00:07:00.720 --> 00:07:01.680
 - Fish.

00:07:01.680 --> 00:07:03.240
 - Sprintails, actually.

00:07:03.240 --> 00:07:04.760
 You know, sprintails, there's tiny insects.

00:07:04.760 --> 00:07:06.240
 - Yes. - Why do you buy those?

00:07:06.240 --> 00:07:08.000
 - I needed to fertilize some soil.

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:10.400
 (all laughing)

00:07:10.400 --> 00:07:14.240
 I did a terrarium workshop and I made a terrarium.

00:07:14.240 --> 00:07:15.960
 Anyway, I went in there to get my sprintails,

00:07:15.960 --> 00:07:17.480
 which was very cheap,

00:07:17.480 --> 00:07:19.260
 three quid for a big box of sprintails.

00:07:19.260 --> 00:07:21.160
 Anyway, they had an axolotl in there.

00:07:21.160 --> 00:07:22.840
 - Oh, yeah. - I was staggered.

00:07:22.840 --> 00:07:24.840
 'Cause I thought, you know, they're very rare.

00:07:24.840 --> 00:07:25.680
 - Did you not buy it?

00:07:25.680 --> 00:07:26.520
 - No. - No.

00:07:26.520 --> 00:07:27.360
 - Really interesting. - I didn't know

00:07:27.360 --> 00:07:28.200
 where to put it.

00:07:28.200 --> 00:07:29.840
 And the guy who ran the aquarium shop was quite annoyed

00:07:29.840 --> 00:07:31.760
 'cause he said when he doesn't have an axolotl in,

00:07:31.760 --> 00:07:32.920
 people only ever say,

00:07:32.920 --> 00:07:34.680
 "Well, do you not have any axolotls?"

00:07:34.680 --> 00:07:36.040
 And then, when he does,

00:07:36.040 --> 00:07:37.360
 they just come in and look at the axolotl

00:07:37.360 --> 00:07:38.800
 and then don't buy it, you know.

00:07:38.800 --> 00:07:40.160
 They treat it like a zoo.

00:07:40.160 --> 00:07:42.120
 - That does feel like one person is going in there

00:07:42.120 --> 00:07:44.520
 every week as a joke and asking for axolotls.

00:07:44.520 --> 00:07:45.480
 (all laughing)

00:07:45.480 --> 00:07:47.400
 - Is an axolotl an amphibian?

00:07:47.400 --> 00:07:48.240
 - Yeah. - I think it is.

00:07:48.240 --> 00:07:51.480
 - Yeah, 'cause they're extinct in the wild, apparently.

00:07:51.480 --> 00:07:54.720
 Yes, they're only in two canals in Mexico City now.

00:07:54.720 --> 00:07:57.160
 Yeah, apart from zoos.

00:07:57.160 --> 00:07:59.920
 And the, because I ask amphibians

00:07:59.920 --> 00:08:04.440
 because another great medieval job was a frog stoner.

00:08:04.440 --> 00:08:07.400
 They used to hire people to throw pebbles into ponds,

00:08:07.400 --> 00:08:08.760
 shut the frogs up at night.

00:08:08.760 --> 00:08:10.160
 (all laughing)

00:08:10.160 --> 00:08:11.000
 - Partying as well.

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:13.880
 - Yeah, the animal king was all parties.

00:08:13.880 --> 00:08:17.120
 But I did think it's a pretty boring job

00:08:17.120 --> 00:08:19.480
 for a pig walker in the middle ages,

00:08:19.480 --> 00:08:21.800
 a municipal swine herd.

00:08:21.800 --> 00:08:24.160
 And I thought we should come up with a better name.

00:08:24.160 --> 00:08:27.480
 So there's some great walking words.

00:08:27.480 --> 00:08:30.760
 Plutch, to flap the feet while walking like a seabird

00:08:30.760 --> 00:08:32.200
 from Shetland.

00:08:32.200 --> 00:08:35.320
 Prol, a short enjoyable walk that's from Kent.

00:08:35.320 --> 00:08:37.560
 Proper stroll, I should think it stands for.

00:08:37.560 --> 00:08:41.720
 Shove, to saunter with extreme laziness from East Anglia.

00:08:41.720 --> 00:08:44.480
 To spandle, to leave wet footprints on the floor.

00:08:44.480 --> 00:08:45.320
 Another Kentish stoner.

00:08:45.320 --> 00:08:47.120
 - So do you think swine spandler?

00:08:47.120 --> 00:08:49.120
 - I think it's exactly a hog-plutcher.

00:08:49.120 --> 00:08:51.360
 - Hog-plutcher. (all laughing)

00:08:51.360 --> 00:08:52.200
 - Now, what's this thing?

00:08:52.200 --> 00:08:54.880
 Like, so later on after the medieval pig thing,

00:08:54.880 --> 00:08:57.640
 urban pigs were a big deal.

00:08:57.640 --> 00:08:59.840
 Basically, in Manchester, everyone had their own pig.

00:08:59.840 --> 00:09:02.000
 And we know this partly 'cause of Friedrich Engels,

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:04.120
 who was writing about the conditions

00:09:04.120 --> 00:09:08.680
 of the working class in England in the 1840s, 1845.

00:09:08.680 --> 00:09:10.560
 And he wrote that that was the case.

00:09:10.560 --> 00:09:12.960
 And another writer was describing North Kensington.

00:09:12.960 --> 00:09:15.280
 And in the mid-19th century, in North Kensington,

00:09:15.280 --> 00:09:17.920
 pigs outnumbered people three to one.

00:09:17.920 --> 00:09:18.760
 - Really?

00:09:18.760 --> 00:09:20.080
 - Quite a lot.

00:09:20.080 --> 00:09:22.600
 - There's more pigs in Spain now than humans.

00:09:22.600 --> 00:09:23.760
 - Really? - Yeah.

00:09:23.760 --> 00:09:26.600
 - Pigs in Spain.

00:09:26.600 --> 00:09:30.760
 In the 1820s, there were more pigs in Manhattan

00:09:30.760 --> 00:09:33.440
 than there are cars in New York today.

00:09:33.440 --> 00:09:34.880
 - Wow.

00:09:34.880 --> 00:09:37.680
 - Well, you know the movie, "The Wolf of Wall Street"?

00:09:37.680 --> 00:09:39.000
 - No, it was previously gonna be called

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:40.520
 "The Three Little Pigs of Wall Street."

00:09:40.520 --> 00:09:43.960
 - It should have been called that as a prequel.

00:09:43.960 --> 00:09:46.240
 The prequel would have been that, exactly that,

00:09:46.240 --> 00:09:49.560
 because the wall of Wall Street initially was a wall, right?

00:09:49.560 --> 00:09:50.720
 This is when the Dutch were there.

00:09:50.720 --> 00:09:51.560
 - Oh, I see.

00:09:51.560 --> 00:09:52.880
 - And they built, yeah, they built this wall.

00:09:52.880 --> 00:09:56.600
 And this was during the 1600s, so 1653 to 1699.

00:09:56.600 --> 00:09:58.680
 As they were building the wall,

00:09:58.680 --> 00:10:01.200
 there was a picket fence that was there before.

00:10:01.200 --> 00:10:02.040
 - A picket fence.

00:10:02.040 --> 00:10:03.080
 - A picket fence, yeah.

00:10:03.080 --> 00:10:04.800
 And it kept getting knocked down by pigs.

00:10:04.800 --> 00:10:06.120
 So it was a huge problem.

00:10:06.120 --> 00:10:08.240
 And they brought in municipal swine herds

00:10:08.240 --> 00:10:09.640
 to try and curb it.

00:10:09.640 --> 00:10:10.960
 And that didn't happen.

00:10:10.960 --> 00:10:14.080
 So then they had to decree that you had to keep your pigs

00:10:14.080 --> 00:10:18.400
 at home until the construction of Wall Street was built.

00:10:18.400 --> 00:10:20.040
 - So the Dutch thing, New Amsterdam,

00:10:20.040 --> 00:10:23.040
 I happen to know that there's a Dutch word, Udvijn,

00:10:23.040 --> 00:10:26.000
 which means to take a bracing walk in the wind.

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:27.360
 Isn't that a lovely thing to have a word for?

00:10:27.360 --> 00:10:28.640
 - Oh, that's good, yeah.

00:10:28.640 --> 00:10:31.360
 - And then the Dutch for pig is big.

00:10:31.360 --> 00:10:32.200
 - Is it really big?

00:10:32.200 --> 00:10:33.040
 - It's big, yeah.

00:10:33.040 --> 00:10:33.920
 - That's correct.

00:10:33.920 --> 00:10:35.000
 You're learning Dutch at the moment.

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:36.160
 - I am, yes.

00:10:36.160 --> 00:10:40.520
 - What was the phrase you gave us just before the show started?

00:10:40.520 --> 00:10:44.760
 - (speaks in foreign language)

00:10:44.760 --> 00:10:46.120
 - Which translates as...

00:10:46.120 --> 00:10:49.000
 - How do we know if the animals in the zoo are happy?

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:51.920
 - Great.

00:10:51.920 --> 00:10:53.280
 - They're philosophical people.

00:10:53.280 --> 00:10:54.440
 - Do you know truffle pigs?

00:10:54.440 --> 00:10:55.640
 You've heard of truffle pigs, right?

00:10:55.640 --> 00:10:56.480
 - Yeah, yeah.

00:10:56.480 --> 00:10:57.480
 - That hunt for truffles.

00:10:57.480 --> 00:10:59.040
 And in the Middle Ages,

00:10:59.040 --> 00:11:01.040
 they didn't, they did hunt for truffles,

00:11:01.040 --> 00:11:03.720
 but they ate them because nobody in the Middle Ages

00:11:03.720 --> 00:11:04.560
 ate truffles.

00:11:04.560 --> 00:11:05.380
 They thought that was weird.

00:11:05.380 --> 00:11:06.720
 - I agree.

00:11:06.720 --> 00:11:11.720
 - Foxes, badges, wolves, wild boar, pigs and rats ate truffles.

00:11:11.720 --> 00:11:14.720
 And they only came back into favor in the Renaissance.

00:11:14.720 --> 00:11:15.960
 So I got interested in truffles.

00:11:15.960 --> 00:11:17.720
 And Rossini, the composer,

00:11:17.720 --> 00:11:19.960
 called the truffle the Mozart of fungi,

00:11:19.960 --> 00:11:21.240
 which is rather nice, isn't it?

00:11:21.240 --> 00:11:22.080
 - Oh.

00:11:22.080 --> 00:11:24.640
 - And he claimed to have only cried three times

00:11:24.640 --> 00:11:26.760
 in his life, Rossini.

00:11:26.760 --> 00:11:29.120
 Once when his first opera was booed,

00:11:29.120 --> 00:11:31.320
 once when he had Paganini play the violin,

00:11:31.320 --> 00:11:33.200
 and once when he was picnic on a boat

00:11:33.200 --> 00:11:35.080
 and the truffle turkey fell overboard.

00:11:35.080 --> 00:11:37.320
 (laughing)

00:11:37.320 --> 00:11:39.900
 (upbeat music)

00:11:39.900 --> 00:11:43.720
 - Okay, it is time for fact number two.

00:11:43.720 --> 00:11:45.080
 And that is my fact.

00:11:45.080 --> 00:11:47.760
 My fact this week is that the comedian Bob Hope

00:11:47.760 --> 00:11:51.040
 was so reliant on his writers to come up with jokes for him,

00:11:51.040 --> 00:11:53.800
 he even had them provide bespoke one-liners

00:11:53.800 --> 00:11:55.280
 for his social life.

00:11:55.280 --> 00:11:57.720
 So we all know Bob Hope.

00:11:57.720 --> 00:11:59.200
 - A lot of people don't these days.

00:11:59.200 --> 00:12:00.040
 (laughing)

00:12:00.040 --> 00:12:01.480
 - Just in case, just in case.

00:12:01.480 --> 00:12:03.080
 - It fell on Stony Grandin.

00:12:03.080 --> 00:12:04.640
 Let's move on to the third fact.

00:12:04.640 --> 00:12:07.400
 (laughing)

00:12:07.400 --> 00:12:08.240
 - So Bob Hope.

00:12:08.240 --> 00:12:09.560
 - So you said comedian.

00:12:09.560 --> 00:12:10.400
 - Yeah.

00:12:10.400 --> 00:12:12.880
 - Bob Hope was possibly the biggest comedian in the world.

00:12:12.880 --> 00:12:13.720
 - He was huge.

00:12:13.720 --> 00:12:14.540
 - He was huge.

00:12:14.540 --> 00:12:15.360
 He lived to 100 years old.

00:12:15.360 --> 00:12:17.360
 He hosted the Oscars 19 times.

00:12:17.360 --> 00:12:20.240
 He was a box office hit during the '40s.

00:12:20.240 --> 00:12:22.640
 Number one movie at one point in the '40s

00:12:22.640 --> 00:12:24.480
 was a Bob Hope movie.

00:12:24.480 --> 00:12:28.800
 He received its estimated 38,000 fan letters per week

00:12:28.800 --> 00:12:30.080
 during the 1940s.

00:12:30.080 --> 00:12:31.920
 This is how loved he was.

00:12:31.920 --> 00:12:35.400
 But he's the person who effectively created the idea

00:12:35.400 --> 00:12:37.500
 of the modern standup monologue

00:12:37.500 --> 00:12:39.920
 where he incorporated himself, the audience,

00:12:39.920 --> 00:12:43.160
 the situation around him, the topical news of the day.

00:12:43.160 --> 00:12:45.920
 And he used to hire so many writers.

00:12:45.920 --> 00:12:47.520
 He was the first person to acknowledge

00:12:47.520 --> 00:12:49.200
 he had writers as well, properly.

00:12:49.200 --> 00:12:52.200
 He would mention, hold the cue cards up higher

00:12:52.200 --> 00:12:53.920
 during his act, be quicker on that.

00:12:53.920 --> 00:12:55.560
 You wouldn't say that if my writers were here.

00:12:55.560 --> 00:12:56.940
 Those kind of lines.

00:12:56.940 --> 00:13:00.760
 And yeah, and so, so much was he reliant on it that,

00:13:00.760 --> 00:13:03.440
 as I say, even if he was going on like a golf game

00:13:03.440 --> 00:13:05.640
 and he knew that he had some powerful CEOs there

00:13:05.640 --> 00:13:06.920
 that he wanted to impress,

00:13:06.920 --> 00:13:08.280
 they would write these jokes for him

00:13:08.280 --> 00:13:09.960
 and he would memorize them and bust them out

00:13:09.960 --> 00:13:10.960
 as if they were ad libs.

00:13:10.960 --> 00:13:11.800
 - Great idea.

00:13:11.800 --> 00:13:12.640
 - Yeah.

00:13:12.640 --> 00:13:13.480
 - I'd love that.

00:13:13.480 --> 00:13:15.280
 - He'd gotten a lot of stick from other comedians.

00:13:15.280 --> 00:13:18.720
 The Lenny Bruce's and the growing world of comedians

00:13:18.720 --> 00:13:21.240
 who were auteur and wrote their own material

00:13:21.240 --> 00:13:24.200
 'cause they saw him as an actor as opposed to a comedian.

00:13:24.200 --> 00:13:27.360
 But I'm a big fan of the way that he led his life.

00:13:27.360 --> 00:13:29.280
 I think, and his comedy life particularly,

00:13:29.280 --> 00:13:31.840
 I think that he innovated so many things.

00:13:31.840 --> 00:13:33.480
 So if he was gonna play in a town,

00:13:33.480 --> 00:13:36.200
 he would send his writers ahead, days ahead,

00:13:36.200 --> 00:13:37.960
 and they would scope around the whole town.

00:13:37.960 --> 00:13:39.240
 They would look at the local shops.

00:13:39.240 --> 00:13:40.320
 They would meet the local people

00:13:40.320 --> 00:13:42.880
 and they would base the material they wrote for him on that.

00:13:42.880 --> 00:13:43.920
 - It would have been weird though,

00:13:43.920 --> 00:13:46.680
 if he's doing a joke about the local hardware shop.

00:13:46.680 --> 00:13:47.840
 - No, I think that's...

00:13:47.840 --> 00:13:49.760
 - Well, do you remember like when we went on tour,

00:13:49.760 --> 00:13:51.560
 we would do facts about the local town?

00:13:51.560 --> 00:13:52.920
 - Oh yeah, but that was good.

00:13:52.920 --> 00:13:53.760
 That was great.

00:13:53.760 --> 00:13:56.960
 That was, you know, that was a very different...

00:13:56.960 --> 00:13:58.440
 - John, did you ever meet Bob Hope?

00:13:58.440 --> 00:13:59.800
 - No, but I spoke to him.

00:13:59.800 --> 00:14:00.840
 - Really? - Yeah.

00:14:00.840 --> 00:14:01.680
 One Christmas Eve,

00:14:01.680 --> 00:14:04.440
 I used to produce a live radio two-show

00:14:04.440 --> 00:14:06.320
 called Late Night Extra when I was very, very young,

00:14:06.320 --> 00:14:10.000
 sort of 24 or something like that, 23 even.

00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:13.920
 And I was producing one on Christmas Eve

00:14:13.920 --> 00:14:16.280
 and I had the best address book in the world probably.

00:14:16.280 --> 00:14:17.600
 It was amazing.

00:14:17.600 --> 00:14:18.440
 Everybody's singing.

00:14:18.440 --> 00:14:19.960
 For some reason, I had Bob Hope's phone number,

00:14:19.960 --> 00:14:23.000
 so I phoned him up in California on Christmas Eve

00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:25.040
 and said, "Hey, Bob, how's it going?"

00:14:25.040 --> 00:14:26.920
 He goes, "Who is this? Who is this?"

00:14:26.920 --> 00:14:28.600
 I said, "It's the BBC in London, Mr. Hope."

00:14:28.600 --> 00:14:32.000
 He goes, "Oh, hi there. Hi, guy, how are you?"

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:34.280
 He was great.

00:14:34.280 --> 00:14:35.120
 - Have you still got the number?

00:14:35.120 --> 00:14:35.960
 Let's call it now.

00:14:35.960 --> 00:14:37.800
 (laughing)

00:14:37.800 --> 00:14:38.920
 - He picks up.

00:14:38.920 --> 00:14:41.320
 - But he was interesting that his attitude to write,

00:14:41.320 --> 00:14:42.720
 he paid them very well.

00:14:42.720 --> 00:14:44.160
 He didn't acknowledge them,

00:14:44.160 --> 00:14:46.600
 but he didn't think the writing was the big deal.

00:14:46.600 --> 00:14:49.200
 He said creating the character was the thing

00:14:49.200 --> 00:14:51.720
 and the lines were just something that the character said.

00:14:51.720 --> 00:14:54.560
 - Yeah, weirdly, a lot of people in recent biographies

00:14:54.560 --> 00:14:56.720
 say that he was terrible at paying his writers.

00:14:56.720 --> 00:14:59.920
 That was sort of an idea that he was really good.

00:14:59.920 --> 00:15:02.160
 Jack Benny would pay two writers the same amount.

00:15:02.160 --> 00:15:04.680
 Jack Benny being another giant comedian of the day,

00:15:04.680 --> 00:15:07.440
 the same amount that Bob would pay 20 writers.

00:15:07.440 --> 00:15:08.720
 What he'd do is he'd find the young writers.

00:15:08.720 --> 00:15:10.680
 - Didn't you say that Jack Benny hated him

00:15:10.680 --> 00:15:11.840
 'cause he had writers?

00:15:11.840 --> 00:15:12.840
 - Not Jack Benny, no.

00:15:12.840 --> 00:15:14.840
 - Oh, I thought you said people like Jack Benny.

00:15:14.840 --> 00:15:15.680
 - Lenny Bruce.

00:15:15.680 --> 00:15:16.800
 - Lenny Bruce.

00:15:16.800 --> 00:15:20.160
 Jack Benny and Lenny Bruce are both double first-namers.

00:15:20.160 --> 00:15:22.720
 Yeah, like Craig David or David Cameron.

00:15:22.720 --> 00:15:23.560
 Anyway.

00:15:23.560 --> 00:15:25.520
 - Do you know who Bob Hope's most famous writer

00:15:25.520 --> 00:15:26.920
 was the least the one I'd heard of?

00:15:26.920 --> 00:15:27.840
 - No.

00:15:27.840 --> 00:15:29.040
 - Larry Gelbart.

00:15:29.040 --> 00:15:29.880
 - Oh yeah, who's that?

00:15:29.880 --> 00:15:30.760
 - When he was very young.

00:15:30.760 --> 00:15:32.160
 He was the guy who wrote "Mash."

00:15:32.160 --> 00:15:33.080
 - Oh wow, okay.

00:15:33.080 --> 00:15:35.920
 - And Bob Hope, one of the things he used to do was tour.

00:15:35.920 --> 00:15:38.040
 He was basically, not only as you say it, Dan,

00:15:38.040 --> 00:15:39.800
 but he sort of invent stand-up comedy,

00:15:39.800 --> 00:15:43.560
 but the touring American forces in the '40s and '50s

00:15:43.560 --> 00:15:44.840
 was also a thing that was really,

00:15:44.840 --> 00:15:47.000
 nobody had ever thought of doing that before.

00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:50.480
 And he did a lot and Larry Gelbart worked for him

00:15:50.480 --> 00:15:53.640
 as a very young man and he was inspired by a tour

00:15:53.640 --> 00:15:56.480
 of the Far East to write "Mash."

00:15:56.480 --> 00:15:58.880
 - Yeah, Bob Hope famously used to do a Christmas show

00:15:58.880 --> 00:16:00.720
 that he would do from the front lines

00:16:00.720 --> 00:16:03.080
 of wherever a war might be going and after a war

00:16:03.080 --> 00:16:05.240
 while people were still stationed out there.

00:16:05.240 --> 00:16:07.680
 So most comedians and acts would go out

00:16:07.680 --> 00:16:10.080
 while it was wartime and he kind of continued on.

00:16:10.080 --> 00:16:11.240
 So he died age 100.

00:16:11.240 --> 00:16:14.600
 He did 48 Christmases out on the road.

00:16:14.600 --> 00:16:16.360
 So 48 of his Christmases were spent

00:16:16.360 --> 00:16:17.960
 in a different country performing to troops.

00:16:17.960 --> 00:16:19.520
 - And one of them speaking to John Lloyd.

00:16:19.520 --> 00:16:20.720
 - And one of them speaking to Lloyd.

00:16:20.720 --> 00:16:23.960
 - Yeah, in a way, like being in a war zone, you know.

00:16:23.960 --> 00:16:26.320
 - But you're, sorry.

00:16:26.320 --> 00:16:28.440
 - "Hope You Christmas" should have been the name of the show.

00:16:28.440 --> 00:16:30.080
 - "Hope You Christmas" doesn't get ever was.

00:16:30.080 --> 00:16:32.000
 - God, he had 48 goes to get that and you didn't.

00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:32.840
 - Never got that.

00:16:32.840 --> 00:16:34.160
 - Never got that, exactly.

00:16:34.160 --> 00:16:36.040
 - Hope is a first name, by the way.

00:16:36.040 --> 00:16:36.880
 - Is it?

00:16:36.880 --> 00:16:38.080
 - Yeah, it's a woman's name.

00:16:38.080 --> 00:16:40.040
 - Bob Hope joins the ranks of...

00:16:40.040 --> 00:16:42.400
 (laughing)

00:16:42.400 --> 00:16:45.080
 - But I was reading that about the wartime thing.

00:16:45.080 --> 00:16:45.920
 - Sorry, sorry, sorry.

00:16:45.920 --> 00:16:48.080
 - Jerry Lewis, two first names.

00:16:48.080 --> 00:16:48.920
 - Jerry Lewis, yeah.

00:16:48.920 --> 00:16:50.320
 - Dean Marden, two first names.

00:16:50.320 --> 00:16:51.320
 - Yeah.

00:16:51.320 --> 00:16:52.640
 - Did they all have first names?

00:16:52.640 --> 00:16:53.840
 - That's extraordinary.

00:16:53.840 --> 00:16:55.360
 - Frank Sinatra, no.

00:16:55.360 --> 00:16:56.200
 - But he's not a comedian.

00:16:56.200 --> 00:16:57.920
 - Great point, all right, on we go.

00:16:57.920 --> 00:16:59.160
 - The thing about his war shows.

00:16:59.160 --> 00:17:00.000
 - Andy Murray.

00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:00.840
 - Oh, that's good.

00:17:00.840 --> 00:17:01.680
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:17:01.680 --> 00:17:02.520
 - So it's not always comedians.

00:17:02.520 --> 00:17:03.360
 - John Lloyd.

00:17:03.360 --> 00:17:04.200
 (laughing)

00:17:04.200 --> 00:17:06.360
 - Yeah, fair enough, John Lloyd, yeah.

00:17:06.360 --> 00:17:08.120
 - I think John Lloyd and Andy Murray

00:17:08.120 --> 00:17:10.080
 are in those weird category of like Lloyd and Murray

00:17:10.080 --> 00:17:12.160
 are kind of first names and kind of surname.

00:17:12.160 --> 00:17:13.000
 You know, they can be both.

00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:13.840
 - Yeah.

00:17:13.840 --> 00:17:16.200
 - It's not the pure simplicity of it, Greg David.

00:17:16.200 --> 00:17:17.040
 - Agreed.

00:17:17.040 --> 00:17:17.880
 - Okay.

00:17:17.880 --> 00:17:20.160
 Did you have something come on?

00:17:20.160 --> 00:17:21.000
 - I did, I did.

00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:21.840
 - Well, no, I was just gonna say

00:17:21.840 --> 00:17:24.560
 what was particularly touching about the war shows

00:17:24.560 --> 00:17:28.360
 is that for a lot of parents, brothers and sisters,

00:17:28.360 --> 00:17:29.640
 whatever, friends at home,

00:17:29.640 --> 00:17:32.640
 this was the only time that they were able to see

00:17:32.640 --> 00:17:34.880
 possibly one of their family members

00:17:34.880 --> 00:17:37.800
 who was off at war on camera during Christmas time.

00:17:37.800 --> 00:17:40.600
 So a lot of the 38,000 letters that came to Bob Hope

00:17:40.600 --> 00:17:43.480
 was from people saying I got to see my boy

00:17:43.480 --> 00:17:45.920
 sitting there in the crowd laughing at your jokes

00:17:45.920 --> 00:17:47.040
 and he didn't make it.

00:17:47.040 --> 00:17:48.720
 He lost his life to the war.

00:17:48.720 --> 00:17:50.600
 Thank you for giving me that moment

00:17:50.600 --> 00:17:51.680
 where I could connect with him.

00:17:51.680 --> 00:17:53.680
 So they were really important shows

00:17:53.680 --> 00:17:55.520
 to America at the time.

00:17:55.520 --> 00:17:57.600
 - His last military gig was in 1990

00:17:57.600 --> 00:18:00.040
 when he went to the Gulf at the age of--

00:18:00.040 --> 00:18:00.880
 - '87.

00:18:00.880 --> 00:18:01.800
 - '87, yeah.

00:18:01.800 --> 00:18:05.040
 And lots of the troops in the crowd for his final gig,

00:18:05.040 --> 00:18:07.080
 they had fathers who had seen him in Vietnam

00:18:07.080 --> 00:18:10.520
 and some of them had grandfathers who had seen Bob Hope

00:18:10.520 --> 00:18:12.480
 in the second world war performing.

00:18:12.480 --> 00:18:13.960
 It's mad, the idea that you go to a gig

00:18:13.960 --> 00:18:15.600
 and your grandfather saw the same comedian.

00:18:15.600 --> 00:18:18.160
 - Yeah, I mean, lucky that you managed to get two generations

00:18:18.160 --> 00:18:19.640
 that they didn't die in the past.

00:18:19.640 --> 00:18:22.360
 - Yeah, that's true, yeah, that's true, yeah.

00:18:22.360 --> 00:18:23.240
 While reading about this,

00:18:23.240 --> 00:18:26.920
 I found my favorite new human.

00:18:26.920 --> 00:18:29.000
 Yeah, just like, it's an exciting character.

00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:31.640
 So this is to do with the writers and so on.

00:18:31.640 --> 00:18:34.000
 It's a guy called Barney McNulty.

00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:36.240
 Bob Hope used to bring him everywhere with him.

00:18:36.240 --> 00:18:37.400
 What do you think he did?

00:18:37.400 --> 00:18:39.280
 He was part of that team.

00:18:39.280 --> 00:18:40.120
 - So not a writer?

00:18:40.120 --> 00:18:40.960
 - Was he a boxer?

00:18:40.960 --> 00:18:43.160
 'Cause Bob Hope was a boxer before he was a comedian.

00:18:43.160 --> 00:18:44.400
 - He was, but no, he wasn't a boxer.

00:18:44.400 --> 00:18:47.000
 - Did he point out whenever he met anyone

00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:48.520
 who had two first names?

00:18:48.520 --> 00:18:49.720
 (laughing)

00:18:49.720 --> 00:18:50.560
 - No, this is--

00:18:50.560 --> 00:18:51.600
 - I could do with one of those guys, James.

00:18:51.600 --> 00:18:52.440
 - Yeah.

00:18:52.440 --> 00:18:53.280
 - I'd love that, yeah, yeah.

00:18:53.280 --> 00:18:54.680
 - I feel like you could be one of those guys, Andy.

00:18:54.680 --> 00:18:56.000
 - Oh, I dream, you know.

00:18:56.000 --> 00:18:58.000
 (laughing)

00:18:58.000 --> 00:19:01.200
 - What's, somewhat like a, just a personal, you know,

00:19:01.200 --> 00:19:03.240
 assistant, like a backburn or a--

00:19:03.240 --> 00:19:06.920
 - So what Barney McNulty was, was the Q-Card guy.

00:19:06.920 --> 00:19:08.760
 And everything was written on Q-Cards.

00:19:08.760 --> 00:19:11.240
 And Barney McNulty is acknowledged

00:19:11.240 --> 00:19:13.640
 with having invented Q-Cards, basically.

00:19:13.640 --> 00:19:17.640
 No one ever delivered monologues on TV before with Q-Cards.

00:19:17.640 --> 00:19:19.520
 And Barney McNulty was the guy to do this.

00:19:19.520 --> 00:19:21.800
 He said doing it was like, it was like a,

00:19:21.800 --> 00:19:23.400
 like handling snakes.

00:19:23.400 --> 00:19:25.440
 You had to work with the rhythm of the comedian.

00:19:25.440 --> 00:19:27.120
 You had to have the font big enough

00:19:27.120 --> 00:19:27.960
 and you're writing and so on.

00:19:27.960 --> 00:19:28.800
 - Like a snake.

00:19:28.800 --> 00:19:29.640
 - Yeah.

00:19:29.640 --> 00:19:30.480
 (laughing)

00:19:30.480 --> 00:19:32.320
 'Cause he said the comedians are wriggling around.

00:19:32.320 --> 00:19:34.120
 They're, they're improvising, they're changing.

00:19:34.120 --> 00:19:35.240
 You don't know where they're gonna go.

00:19:35.240 --> 00:19:36.080
 It's kind of--

00:19:36.080 --> 00:19:36.920
 - Like an auto-Q person.

00:19:36.920 --> 00:19:38.320
 - Yeah, like a modern day auto-Q person.

00:19:38.320 --> 00:19:40.320
 - So sometimes the auto-Q can be done too fast

00:19:40.320 --> 00:19:42.360
 or too slow and the presenter gets in a tangle

00:19:42.360 --> 00:19:43.200
 and then--

00:19:43.200 --> 00:19:44.040
 - Yeah, yeah.

00:19:44.040 --> 00:19:44.860
 - Yeah, auto-Qs are boring then.

00:19:44.860 --> 00:19:45.700
 It should be called a McNulty, shouldn't it?

00:19:45.700 --> 00:19:46.540
 - Yes.

00:19:46.540 --> 00:19:47.380
 - The McNulty, yeah.

00:19:47.380 --> 00:19:49.000
 So McNulty was so important to him.

00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:50.920
 Steve Allen, who's another comedian of the time,

00:19:50.920 --> 00:19:52.360
 said that he was once at a barbecue.

00:19:52.360 --> 00:19:53.200
 - Steve Allen.

00:19:53.200 --> 00:19:54.440
 - Yep, Steve Allen.

00:19:54.440 --> 00:19:55.280
 - Oh, yeah!

00:19:55.280 --> 00:19:56.120
 (laughing)

00:19:56.120 --> 00:19:57.720
 - Oh, this is, you've uncovered a scene.

00:19:57.720 --> 00:20:00.480
 (laughing)

00:20:00.480 --> 00:20:02.360
 Once, the problem is once you start seeing them,

00:20:02.360 --> 00:20:03.200
 you can't stop.

00:20:03.200 --> 00:20:04.040
 - Yeah.

00:20:04.040 --> 00:20:04.880
 - Yeah.

00:20:04.880 --> 00:20:05.720
 I've been this way for years.

00:20:05.720 --> 00:20:06.560
 (laughing)

00:20:06.560 --> 00:20:09.600
 So he was at a party at Barbecue with Bob Hope

00:20:09.600 --> 00:20:12.640
 and Bob came out and suddenly just did an improvised speech

00:20:12.640 --> 00:20:14.720
 to all the people, it's nighttime.

00:20:14.720 --> 00:20:15.760
 He's, "Yeah, thank you for coming."

00:20:15.760 --> 00:20:17.160
 And he's doing all these jokes.

00:20:17.160 --> 00:20:18.960
 And Steve said, he's hearing these jokes

00:20:18.960 --> 00:20:20.840
 and he's thinking, "This is a pretty worked out monologue,

00:20:20.840 --> 00:20:22.440
 but it's pretty topical."

00:20:22.440 --> 00:20:24.640
 Turns around, he says, "He notices sitting in the bushes

00:20:24.640 --> 00:20:26.280
 with a flashlight and some cue cards,

00:20:26.280 --> 00:20:31.240
 is McNulty hiding away, giving him the cue cards to do it."

00:20:31.240 --> 00:20:33.880
 - So I haven't really said very much in this part

00:20:33.880 --> 00:20:36.320
 because I don't really know anything about comedy,

00:20:36.320 --> 00:20:38.040
 but I do know a lot about golf.

00:20:38.040 --> 00:20:39.960
 (laughing)

00:20:39.960 --> 00:20:41.800
 And Bob Hope used to love golf.

00:20:41.800 --> 00:20:44.000
 And that's really kind of all I knew about him

00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:45.480
 is that he was a golfer.

00:20:45.480 --> 00:20:49.760
 I read that, you know, Alan Shepard, the astronaut,

00:20:49.760 --> 00:20:52.200
 yeah, he hit a golf ball on the moon.

00:20:52.200 --> 00:20:54.440
 And according to Bob Hope, it was his idea.

00:20:54.440 --> 00:20:55.280
 - No.

00:20:55.280 --> 00:20:59.160
 - Yeah, he said that he was once speaking to Alan Shepard

00:20:59.160 --> 00:21:01.800
 and he used to kind of always carry his golf clubs around him,

00:21:01.800 --> 00:21:02.840
 kind of just to--

00:21:02.840 --> 00:21:03.800
 - That was his thing, he would--

00:21:03.800 --> 00:21:06.200
 - Yeah, and he reckoned that Alan Shepard

00:21:06.200 --> 00:21:08.520
 got the inspiration by watching him

00:21:08.520 --> 00:21:10.200
 swing in his golf club.

00:21:10.200 --> 00:21:12.840
 He was on the Mike Douglas show

00:21:12.840 --> 00:21:15.640
 when Tiger Woods first appeared on television

00:21:15.640 --> 00:21:17.280
 when he was two years old.

00:21:17.280 --> 00:21:19.320
 So Tiger Woods was a little dot

00:21:19.320 --> 00:21:20.800
 and he was kind of hitting golf balls

00:21:20.800 --> 00:21:22.080
 and everyone was like, look how amazing

00:21:22.080 --> 00:21:24.280
 this little kid is at playing golf.

00:21:24.280 --> 00:21:27.520
 And Bob Hope was on the show when that happened.

00:21:27.520 --> 00:21:29.680
 So he's there for the start of Tiger Woods.

00:21:29.680 --> 00:21:33.200
 And apparently on his first date, he was so nervous,

00:21:33.200 --> 00:21:37.080
 he would just sit and draw golf holes on the tablecloth.

00:21:37.080 --> 00:21:40.880
 And he did it so much that they made him pay for the tablecloth

00:21:40.880 --> 00:21:42.920
 because he'd draw all these golf holes on it.

00:21:42.920 --> 00:21:43.960
 - Oh, that's so great.

00:21:43.960 --> 00:21:46.000
 - I certainly claim they were golf holes later on.

00:21:46.000 --> 00:21:47.720
 (all laughing)

00:21:47.720 --> 00:21:49.600
 - These, oh, they're--

00:21:49.600 --> 00:21:50.800
 - And Alan Shepard with, of course,

00:21:50.800 --> 00:21:52.600
 a job in the Middle Ages.

00:21:52.600 --> 00:21:56.280
 (all laughing)

00:21:56.280 --> 00:21:58.360
 - I thought that was your job on QI, John.

00:21:58.360 --> 00:21:59.360
 (all laughing)

00:21:59.360 --> 00:22:01.940
 (upbeat music)

00:22:02.380 --> 00:22:04.660
 (upbeat music)

00:22:04.660 --> 00:22:07.060
 - Okay, it is time for fact number three,

00:22:07.060 --> 00:22:08.860
 and that is James.

00:22:08.860 --> 00:22:13.420
 - Okay, my fact this week is that the unarmed stick insect

00:22:13.420 --> 00:22:15.660
 has an infinite number of arms.

00:22:15.660 --> 00:22:19.740
 (all laughing)

00:22:19.740 --> 00:22:21.980
 - Um, okay.

00:22:21.980 --> 00:22:22.820
 - So what?

00:22:22.820 --> 00:22:24.420
 - I'm not saying anything else, that's it.

00:22:24.420 --> 00:22:25.260
 - Why is it, that's it?

00:22:25.260 --> 00:22:26.260
 Does it play golf?

00:22:26.260 --> 00:22:28.060
 (all laughing)

00:22:28.060 --> 00:22:29.140
 Infinite is a big word.

00:22:29.140 --> 00:22:29.980
 - Yeah, that's a big word, I was gonna say that.

00:22:29.980 --> 00:22:31.300
 - It's a long word, yeah.

00:22:31.300 --> 00:22:32.820
 - It's a full eight letters.

00:22:32.820 --> 00:22:33.660
 - Don't you mean that?

00:22:33.660 --> 00:22:34.940
 (all laughing)

00:22:34.940 --> 00:22:37.780
 - It's, no, the thing is, I would say,

00:22:37.780 --> 00:22:39.700
 sticking sets can regrow their limbs.

00:22:39.700 --> 00:22:40.700
 - Yeah, right? - Theoretically.

00:22:40.700 --> 00:22:41.540
 - Theoretically.

00:22:41.540 --> 00:22:44.740
 - Theoretically, possibly forever.

00:22:44.740 --> 00:22:46.540
 You know, if you keep chopping them off,

00:22:46.540 --> 00:22:47.380
 they'll keep growing them.

00:22:47.380 --> 00:22:49.340
 - Yeah, the main body doesn't live forever,

00:22:49.340 --> 00:22:50.180
 does it, or does it?

00:22:50.180 --> 00:22:51.220
 - No, no, no.

00:22:51.220 --> 00:22:53.980
 I think probably we would reach a time limit.

00:22:53.980 --> 00:22:54.820
 The other thing--

00:22:54.820 --> 00:22:55.660
 - Like about a week?

00:22:55.660 --> 00:22:56.820
 - Well, 'cause they would die,

00:22:56.820 --> 00:22:58.460
 but the other problem is they can only do it

00:22:58.460 --> 00:22:59.300
 when they're young.

00:22:59.300 --> 00:23:00.140
 - Okay.

00:23:00.140 --> 00:23:02.740
 - But they could keep doing it and doing it and doing it

00:23:02.740 --> 00:23:04.500
 if you kept chopping off all the limbs.

00:23:04.500 --> 00:23:06.900
 - Yeah, hell of a shock to your juvenile stick insect.

00:23:06.900 --> 00:23:08.940
 The first time it chops an arm off

00:23:08.940 --> 00:23:11.580
 and it doesn't grow back, it thinks, oh no,

00:23:11.580 --> 00:23:13.540
 now I'm officially no longer a juvenile.

00:23:13.540 --> 00:23:14.380
 - Yeah, it must be.

00:23:14.380 --> 00:23:15.340
 - 'Cause you must get used to operating

00:23:15.340 --> 00:23:16.180
 with complete impunity.

00:23:16.180 --> 00:23:18.220
 - It's a real coming of age moment, isn't it?

00:23:18.220 --> 00:23:19.940
 - Yes, yeah.

00:23:19.940 --> 00:23:22.780
 - So they can keep regrowing their arms.

00:23:22.780 --> 00:23:25.500
 Another question is, do they have arms or are they legs?

00:23:25.500 --> 00:23:26.840
 (all laughing)

00:23:26.840 --> 00:23:27.680
 - It's called unarmed.

00:23:27.680 --> 00:23:29.300
 Is there a reason why it's called unarmed?

00:23:29.300 --> 00:23:31.460
 - Yeah, because it doesn't have defenses.

00:23:31.460 --> 00:23:33.580
 - Yes, it's armed as in weapons.

00:23:33.580 --> 00:23:35.940
 - Yeah, to be honest, it's just a silly thing

00:23:35.940 --> 00:23:37.560
 'cause I noticed it was called unarmed

00:23:37.560 --> 00:23:40.140
 and I remembered they could keep regrowing their arms.

00:23:40.140 --> 00:23:40.980
 - Yeah, that's so great.

00:23:40.980 --> 00:23:42.860
 - But I just thought let's talk about stick insects

00:23:42.860 --> 00:23:44.540
 'cause stick insects are awesome.

00:23:44.540 --> 00:23:47.060
 These ones, these unarmed stick insects

00:23:47.060 --> 00:23:50.500
 are the most common stick insects found in Britain.

00:23:50.500 --> 00:23:51.340
 - Are they?

00:23:51.340 --> 00:23:52.540
 - Oh, yes they are.

00:23:52.540 --> 00:23:56.780
 Because we have no native stick insects in this country,

00:23:56.780 --> 00:23:59.980
 but one of them accidentally got brought in some timber

00:23:59.980 --> 00:24:02.020
 from New Zealand in the 20s.

00:24:02.020 --> 00:24:02.860
 - Right.

00:24:02.860 --> 00:24:05.100
 - And they reproduce pathogenically

00:24:05.100 --> 00:24:07.780
 so they don't need more than one of them

00:24:07.780 --> 00:24:09.740
 to create more and more and more of them.

00:24:09.740 --> 00:24:12.460
 - It's really pleasing that it came over in some timber

00:24:12.460 --> 00:24:15.820
 disguised as a smaller stick in a load of larger sticks.

00:24:15.820 --> 00:24:16.660
 That's brilliant.

00:24:16.660 --> 00:24:18.220
 - There was probably a guy at the park

00:24:18.220 --> 00:24:19.860
 just counting all of these sticks

00:24:19.860 --> 00:24:21.940
 and go, we've got one too many.

00:24:21.940 --> 00:24:23.820
 (all laughing)

00:24:23.820 --> 00:24:26.980
 So these were discovered in New Zealand in 1955

00:24:26.980 --> 00:24:30.140
 by a man who also, like this misnamed animal,

00:24:30.140 --> 00:24:32.620
 is called John Salmon, not a fish.

00:24:32.620 --> 00:24:33.460
 - That's amazing.

00:24:33.460 --> 00:24:36.260
 - But he is responsible for discovering,

00:24:36.260 --> 00:24:39.700
 so there's a Wikipedia list of stick insects of New Zealand

00:24:39.700 --> 00:24:41.260
 of which there are 23.

00:24:41.260 --> 00:24:44.900
 John Salmon discovered nine of the stick insects of New Zealand.

00:24:44.900 --> 00:24:45.740
 - Oh yeah.

00:24:45.740 --> 00:24:48.220
 - You do find the same people come up again and again

00:24:48.220 --> 00:24:49.740
 when you look at all the different species

00:24:49.740 --> 00:24:51.980
 of stick insects, tends to be the same.

00:24:51.980 --> 00:24:55.220
 - It's almost if no one else is looking for stick insects,

00:24:55.220 --> 00:24:56.060
 right?

00:24:56.060 --> 00:24:56.900
 Or maybe they're specialized

00:24:56.900 --> 00:24:57.900
 'cause they're quite hard to see.

00:24:57.900 --> 00:24:58.820
 - They're so hard.

00:24:58.820 --> 00:25:01.300
 So I was reading about leaf insects,

00:25:01.300 --> 00:25:03.100
 which are similar, you know, they look,

00:25:03.100 --> 00:25:05.580
 and they are unbelievably realistic leaf insects.

00:25:05.580 --> 00:25:07.740
 As in they attach to a tree where they look exactly

00:25:07.740 --> 00:25:10.260
 like that leaf, and they have little bit and out edges.

00:25:10.260 --> 00:25:11.660
 So it looks like an insect.

00:25:11.660 --> 00:25:12.980
 - So amazing.

00:25:12.980 --> 00:25:16.860
 - But lots of experts on leaf and stick insects

00:25:16.860 --> 00:25:19.420
 have never seen them in the wild.

00:25:19.420 --> 00:25:20.380
 It's quite tragic really.

00:25:20.380 --> 00:25:21.820
 So there's a guy called Royce Cumming,

00:25:21.820 --> 00:25:23.620
 who's a world expert on leaf insects.

00:25:23.620 --> 00:25:25.300
 He's never seen one in the wild.

00:25:25.300 --> 00:25:27.140
 - That's amazing.

00:25:27.140 --> 00:25:28.700
 - Because what, you know, it's really hard for me.

00:25:28.700 --> 00:25:30.740
 - 'Cause you can't just check every leaf.

00:25:30.740 --> 00:25:32.900
 - Exactly, that's the problem.

00:25:32.900 --> 00:25:33.820
 That's exactly it.

00:25:33.820 --> 00:25:35.060
 - Yeah, it's a nightmare.

00:25:35.060 --> 00:25:35.900
 If you wanna get a new cell.

00:25:35.900 --> 00:25:37.620
 - Stupid, they should have gone for like.

00:25:37.620 --> 00:25:38.460
 - Yeah, elephants.

00:25:38.460 --> 00:25:39.940
 - Elephants, absolutely.

00:25:39.940 --> 00:25:42.460
 - Stick insects feature in Maori myth.

00:25:42.460 --> 00:25:44.140
 - Yes, right.

00:25:44.140 --> 00:25:44.980
 - Quite a few times.

00:25:44.980 --> 00:25:47.380
 And just something I just happened to know

00:25:47.380 --> 00:25:49.820
 about Maori, the language,

00:25:49.820 --> 00:25:53.020
 which is the Maori for nuclear warfare,

00:25:53.020 --> 00:25:54.660
 is umu pongi pongi.

00:25:54.660 --> 00:25:56.340
 - Right.

00:25:56.340 --> 00:25:57.660
 - You didn't think they would have a word for it,

00:25:57.660 --> 00:25:58.500
 but they do.

00:25:58.500 --> 00:26:00.660
 - Your duolingo is very bold.

00:26:00.660 --> 00:26:01.820
 You're like a far ranger.

00:26:01.820 --> 00:26:03.060
 - This is a dictionary.

00:26:03.060 --> 00:26:05.180
 This is not duolingo.

00:26:05.180 --> 00:26:06.820
 - Other language apps are available.

00:26:06.820 --> 00:26:08.260
 Memorise, et cetera.

00:26:08.260 --> 00:26:11.940
 - When stick insects feel under threat.

00:26:11.940 --> 00:26:12.780
 - Oh yeah.

00:26:12.780 --> 00:26:14.100
 - They will play dead.

00:26:14.100 --> 00:26:18.420
 Or be more like a stick than usual, basically.

00:26:18.420 --> 00:26:21.620
 And I found an insect owning website

00:26:21.620 --> 00:26:23.020
 which had a problem page.

00:26:23.020 --> 00:26:24.420
 And the problem was,

00:26:24.420 --> 00:26:27.540
 is my stick insect playing dead or has it died?

00:26:27.540 --> 00:26:31.140
 - Or is it in fact a twig?

00:26:31.140 --> 00:26:34.500
 - We used to have stick insects when I was a kid.

00:26:34.500 --> 00:26:35.620
 Pet and stick insects.

00:26:35.620 --> 00:26:36.460
 Yeah, yeah.

00:26:36.460 --> 00:26:38.800
 And it is, I mean, they did die,

00:26:38.800 --> 00:26:41.020
 I'm sorry to say, quite regularly.

00:26:41.020 --> 00:26:42.300
 They didn't live very long.

00:26:42.300 --> 00:26:44.900
 I hope that wasn't due to our bad husbandry, but.

00:26:44.900 --> 00:26:46.740
 - Or did they die very frequently?

00:26:46.740 --> 00:26:48.620
 - Maybe they were just trying to get themselves thrown out.

00:26:48.620 --> 00:26:51.020
 - We usually check, I don't know what your FAQs will say,

00:26:51.020 --> 00:26:53.500
 but for us it was usually when there weren't many poos

00:26:53.500 --> 00:26:55.500
 for a few days, that was a problem.

00:26:55.500 --> 00:26:57.300
 - What's a poo look like from a stick insect?

00:26:57.300 --> 00:26:58.860
 - It's just like a black dot.

00:26:58.860 --> 00:26:59.700
 - Right, nice.

00:26:59.700 --> 00:27:00.700
 - Yeah.

00:27:00.700 --> 00:27:03.100
 - Well, this is basically, if they're threatened,

00:27:03.100 --> 00:27:05.180
 they fold their legs up and they paralyze themselves

00:27:05.180 --> 00:27:07.780
 and they often fall off the branch to the foliage.

00:27:07.780 --> 00:27:09.940
 But that happens if they get surprised,

00:27:09.940 --> 00:27:11.660
 if they face any surprise until they're played dead.

00:27:11.660 --> 00:27:14.740
 So you either wait to see if the color has changed,

00:27:14.740 --> 00:27:17.100
 'cause that is a sign that they can't do that by themselves.

00:27:17.100 --> 00:27:20.340
 - Can the leaf insects change color in the autumn?

00:27:20.340 --> 00:27:21.780
 - I don't think so.

00:27:21.780 --> 00:27:23.300
 - Okay.

00:27:23.300 --> 00:27:24.380
 - And the other thing you can do,

00:27:24.380 --> 00:27:25.380
 there's just a bit of advice,

00:27:25.380 --> 00:27:28.460
 is to stimulate the insect's mouth palps,

00:27:28.460 --> 00:27:30.300
 which are these small organs near the mouth,

00:27:30.300 --> 00:27:32.300
 which are incredibly sensitive.

00:27:32.300 --> 00:27:33.320
 And if you stimulate those,

00:27:33.320 --> 00:27:36.620
 it will make a sudden movement, 'cause it hates that.

00:27:36.620 --> 00:27:38.140
 And if not, it has died.

00:27:38.140 --> 00:27:42.420
 I'm slightly moved by all these pets and things dying

00:27:42.420 --> 00:27:46.140
 because my dad was in the Navy, we never had pets.

00:27:46.140 --> 00:27:47.460
 So when the kids were small,

00:27:47.460 --> 00:27:50.700
 we won a goldfish at a fair in Chipping Norton,

00:27:50.700 --> 00:27:52.780
 who was called Chippy, the fish.

00:27:52.780 --> 00:27:54.100
 I love this little fish

00:27:54.100 --> 00:27:57.380
 and it got something wrong with it, swim bladder.

00:27:57.380 --> 00:27:58.820
 And I was really heartbroken.

00:27:58.820 --> 00:28:01.180
 I was very sort of, you know, anxious about it.

00:28:01.180 --> 00:28:05.020
 And so I used to take it to the local vet

00:28:05.020 --> 00:28:07.460
 in a bucket in Hammersmith.

00:28:07.460 --> 00:28:10.940
 And so I was sitting there in a bucket,

00:28:10.940 --> 00:28:14.260
 this little goldfish in a tiny little thing, fair goldfish.

00:28:14.260 --> 00:28:15.100
 - Was it on a lead?

00:28:15.100 --> 00:28:15.940
 No.

00:28:15.940 --> 00:28:17.540
 (all laughing)

00:28:17.540 --> 00:28:19.860
 - And all these people would be there with salukis

00:28:19.860 --> 00:28:23.180
 and parakeets and horses and things like that.

00:28:23.180 --> 00:28:25.780
 And the vet's assistant would come out and say,

00:28:25.780 --> 00:28:30.220
 "Mrs. Campbell Rouse and Montmorency, the third?"

00:28:30.220 --> 00:28:31.220
 (all laughing)

00:28:31.220 --> 00:28:33.940
 And so he would get up with an antelope or something.

00:28:33.940 --> 00:28:34.940
 (all laughing)

00:28:34.940 --> 00:28:38.060
 They came to me and she'd go, "Mr. Lloyd and fish?"

00:28:38.060 --> 00:28:39.980
 (all laughing)

00:28:39.980 --> 00:28:41.420
 And after about four visits,

00:28:41.420 --> 00:28:44.220
 and what he used to do the vet was inject this goldfish

00:28:44.220 --> 00:28:45.420
 with something wrong with the swim bladder,

00:28:45.420 --> 00:28:47.220
 with the tiniest little hypotermics

00:28:47.220 --> 00:28:50.340
 that you've ever seen, about two inches long.

00:28:50.340 --> 00:28:51.980
 And after the fourth time he said,

00:28:51.980 --> 00:28:55.140
 "Mr. Lloyd, I'm afraid there's nothing more I can do for fish.

00:28:55.140 --> 00:28:56.540
 He's going to take his chances."

00:28:56.540 --> 00:28:59.620
 - Oh, 'cause that is a problem with goldfish, isn't it?

00:28:59.620 --> 00:29:02.020
 They get these swim bladder problems

00:29:02.020 --> 00:29:03.660
 and they'll kind of float to the surface

00:29:03.660 --> 00:29:05.460
 and sometimes they go upside down.

00:29:05.460 --> 00:29:07.180
 And people think that they're dead,

00:29:07.180 --> 00:29:08.380
 but actually they're not dead.

00:29:08.380 --> 00:29:11.380
 They can be, they can have their swim bladder pricked

00:29:11.380 --> 00:29:12.460
 and they'll come back. - Oh, you're joking.

00:29:12.460 --> 00:29:15.140
 - And so people flush the fish down the toilet,

00:29:15.140 --> 00:29:16.180
 but they're not actually dead.

00:29:16.180 --> 00:29:17.740
 They probably don't flush very well either

00:29:17.740 --> 00:29:20.180
 'cause they are quite buoyant that stage.

00:29:20.180 --> 00:29:21.900
 - Oh, no. - Yeah.

00:29:21.900 --> 00:29:23.380
 - That's terrible. - It's public service.

00:29:23.380 --> 00:29:24.220
 - Yeah.

00:29:24.220 --> 00:29:25.220
 - I was just thinking Mr. Lloyd and fish

00:29:25.220 --> 00:29:26.900
 is basically this episode, isn't it?

00:29:26.900 --> 00:29:29.480
 (all laughing)

00:29:29.480 --> 00:29:32.220
 - Very good.

00:29:32.220 --> 00:29:33.500
 Did you know that some children,

00:29:33.500 --> 00:29:35.740
 human children can regenerate fingertips.

00:29:35.740 --> 00:29:37.300
 Did you, I was astounded when I first--

00:29:37.300 --> 00:29:38.780
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah, I had heard that.

00:29:38.780 --> 00:29:40.220
 - And many doctors don't know that

00:29:40.220 --> 00:29:42.060
 so that they just grow back their fingertips

00:29:42.060 --> 00:29:43.700
 if you cut them off. - Yeah.

00:29:43.700 --> 00:29:45.660
 Up to a certain, it's kind of much like the stick insect.

00:29:45.660 --> 00:29:47.700
 You don't wanna, there's a cut off part, isn't it?

00:29:47.700 --> 00:29:50.020
 - And it's under a certain amount of the finger, I think.

00:29:50.020 --> 00:29:53.380
 It's not at the base, but it's the top joint.

00:29:53.380 --> 00:29:54.540
 - Yeah. - Or the fingernail.

00:29:54.540 --> 00:29:56.140
 If there's only a tiny bit of the fingernail left,

00:29:56.140 --> 00:29:57.740
 the whole rest of it can grow back.

00:29:57.740 --> 00:30:00.740
 - Well, so human children have infinite fingers.

00:30:00.740 --> 00:30:01.580
 - Yes.

00:30:01.580 --> 00:30:03.740
 - And it's another, don't try this at home, isn't it?

00:30:03.740 --> 00:30:05.380
 (all laughing)

00:30:05.380 --> 00:30:06.300
 - Speaking of children,

00:30:06.300 --> 00:30:08.700
 have you guys heard of John George Children?

00:30:08.700 --> 00:30:10.060
 (all laughing)

00:30:10.060 --> 00:30:10.900
 - No.

00:30:10.900 --> 00:30:14.260
 - He was a famous entomologist of the early 19th century.

00:30:14.260 --> 00:30:17.980
 And there's a stick insect called children's stick insect,

00:30:17.980 --> 00:30:19.260
 which is named after him.

00:30:19.260 --> 00:30:21.220
 - No. - Yeah.

00:30:21.220 --> 00:30:22.780
 He was a, as well as an entomologist,

00:30:22.780 --> 00:30:24.020
 he was a biologist.

00:30:24.020 --> 00:30:26.980
 And one amazing thing he did, in 1815,

00:30:26.980 --> 00:30:29.740
 he traveled to the battlefield of Waterloo

00:30:29.740 --> 00:30:31.300
 just after the battle.

00:30:31.300 --> 00:30:33.380
 And he purchased a tree

00:30:33.380 --> 00:30:36.860
 under which the Duke of Wellington had made his headquarters.

00:30:36.860 --> 00:30:39.140
 And so he, basically what had happened was,

00:30:39.140 --> 00:30:41.100
 the battle had happened and everyone had gone away

00:30:41.100 --> 00:30:43.100
 and loads of souvenir hunters were going in

00:30:43.100 --> 00:30:45.380
 and sort of chopping bits off this tree.

00:30:45.380 --> 00:30:47.780
 But he actually went and bought the entire tree

00:30:47.780 --> 00:30:51.540
 and had it made into furniture by Chippendale,

00:30:51.540 --> 00:30:52.380
 Thomas Chippendale.

00:30:52.380 --> 00:30:53.420
 - Wow. - Wow.

00:30:53.420 --> 00:30:54.260
 - Isn't that amazing?

00:30:54.260 --> 00:30:55.460
 - Was it called a Waterloo tree?

00:30:55.460 --> 00:30:56.420
 Was that, what is that thing?

00:30:56.420 --> 00:30:58.420
 - It was called the Elm, Waterloo Elm.

00:30:58.420 --> 00:30:59.780
 - Waterloo Elm. - Yeah.

00:30:59.780 --> 00:31:00.620
 - That is, wow.

00:31:00.620 --> 00:31:02.700
 - And I thought I'd see if John George Children

00:31:02.700 --> 00:31:06.100
 had any children and he did.

00:31:06.100 --> 00:31:08.740
 He had a daughter called Anna Atkins.

00:31:08.740 --> 00:31:12.020
 And she was the first person, we think, possibly,

00:31:12.020 --> 00:31:15.660
 to publish a book illustrated with photographic images.

00:31:15.660 --> 00:31:19.700
 She was a friend of Fox Talbot,

00:31:19.700 --> 00:31:22.100
 who made one of the first cameras.

00:31:22.100 --> 00:31:26.180
 And she made a book in 1843, which had photos in it.

00:31:26.180 --> 00:31:28.140
 Can you guess what the book was about?

00:31:28.140 --> 00:31:31.420
 First ever book with photos in it.

00:31:31.420 --> 00:31:32.820
 - Insects, the Battle of Waterloo.

00:31:32.820 --> 00:31:34.540
 - It's gonna be third of something.

00:31:34.540 --> 00:31:37.020
 - Something slow-moving, tortoises, twigs.

00:31:37.020 --> 00:31:38.020
 - Twigs.

00:31:38.020 --> 00:31:39.220
 - Children, children.

00:31:39.220 --> 00:31:41.980
 - Children, no, it was something very slow-moving.

00:31:41.980 --> 00:31:44.580
 - Oh, tortoises, tortoises.

00:31:44.580 --> 00:31:45.900
 - Rivers.

00:31:45.900 --> 00:31:47.540
 - It was very leisurely rivers.

00:31:47.540 --> 00:31:49.500
 - Meandering river.

00:31:49.500 --> 00:31:51.780
 - Yeah, something slow-moving, slugs.

00:31:51.780 --> 00:31:52.620
 - Smaller.

00:31:52.620 --> 00:31:54.140
 - The big book of slug photos.

00:31:54.140 --> 00:31:55.700
 Smaller than the slugs, lobsters.

00:31:55.700 --> 00:31:56.540
 No, no, that's not small.

00:31:56.540 --> 00:31:57.860
 - No, they're bigger than the slugs.

00:31:57.860 --> 00:31:58.980
 - Smaller than the slugs.

00:31:58.980 --> 00:31:59.820
 - Yeah, the rapids.

00:31:59.820 --> 00:32:01.220
 - The snail, is that smaller?

00:32:01.220 --> 00:32:02.540
 - That's about the same size.

00:32:02.540 --> 00:32:03.380
 - Oh, come on.

00:32:03.380 --> 00:32:05.140
 - I mean, much smaller than a slug.

00:32:05.140 --> 00:32:06.780
 - Oh, worms, tiny worms.

00:32:06.780 --> 00:32:07.620
 - Smaller.

00:32:07.620 --> 00:32:09.460
 - Smaller than the worms.

00:32:09.460 --> 00:32:11.980
 Parasitic wasps, they're tiny, tiny, tiny.

00:32:11.980 --> 00:32:13.580
 - I think a bit bigger than that.

00:32:13.580 --> 00:32:14.420
 I'll tell you.

00:32:14.420 --> 00:32:15.260
 - Well, there's water bears.

00:32:15.260 --> 00:32:16.100
 - Tartigrades.

00:32:16.100 --> 00:32:16.940
 - Tartigrades.

00:32:16.940 --> 00:32:17.780
 - Tartigrades.

00:32:17.780 --> 00:32:18.780
 - The big book of Tartigrade photos.

00:32:18.780 --> 00:32:20.100
 That was the first ever.

00:32:20.100 --> 00:32:21.900
 - Yeah, was of a Tartigrade.

00:32:21.900 --> 00:32:23.140
 No, it was of algae.

00:32:23.140 --> 00:32:28.100
 Her book was called Photographs of British Algae,

00:32:28.100 --> 00:32:30.260
 Cyanotype Impressions.

00:32:30.260 --> 00:32:32.060
 And it came out in October, 1843.

00:32:32.060 --> 00:32:33.380
 And that was the first ever book

00:32:33.380 --> 00:32:35.700
 illustrated with photographic images.

00:32:35.700 --> 00:32:36.540
 - It's very nice.

00:32:36.540 --> 00:32:37.580
 - I'm still recovering.

00:32:37.580 --> 00:32:38.420
 - Me too, I was about to say--

00:32:38.420 --> 00:32:39.260
 - It's still recovering from that thrilling--

00:32:39.260 --> 00:32:40.540
 - I was about to say, you look great.

00:32:40.540 --> 00:32:42.100
 - How these quizzes really get you

00:32:42.100 --> 00:32:43.740
 feeling like you're doing exercise.

00:32:43.740 --> 00:32:45.460
 - They pump me up.

00:32:45.460 --> 00:32:47.460
 These things are always so,

00:32:47.460 --> 00:32:49.700
 when you do these dives into things,

00:32:49.700 --> 00:32:51.300
 like regeneration, for example,

00:32:51.300 --> 00:32:52.500
 it's so miraculous, isn't it?

00:32:52.500 --> 00:32:54.820
 And all the creatures that can

00:32:54.820 --> 00:32:57.940
 axolotls and salamanders and sharks

00:32:57.940 --> 00:33:00.180
 regenerate teeth all the time.

00:33:00.180 --> 00:33:04.100
 And cockroaches can grow new legs.

00:33:04.100 --> 00:33:04.940
 Did you know that?

00:33:04.940 --> 00:33:06.020
 - No.

00:33:06.020 --> 00:33:09.780
 - And cockroaches have got a bigger genome than people.

00:33:09.780 --> 00:33:10.620
 - Okay.

00:33:10.620 --> 00:33:13.940
 - And they taste inside,

00:33:13.940 --> 00:33:15.260
 the innards of a cockroach.

00:33:15.260 --> 00:33:17.140
 Tastes like blue cheese.

00:33:17.140 --> 00:33:17.980
 - Really?

00:33:17.980 --> 00:33:18.820
 - Amazing, yeah.

00:33:18.820 --> 00:33:21.780
 And axolotls, they've got 30 billion base pairs

00:33:21.780 --> 00:33:22.620
 in their genome.

00:33:22.620 --> 00:33:24.420
 That's 10 times as much as we have.

00:33:24.420 --> 00:33:25.260
 - Wow.

00:33:25.260 --> 00:33:27.020
 - Do you think that guy who was selling axolotls

00:33:27.020 --> 00:33:28.620
 in your shop only had one of them?

00:33:28.620 --> 00:33:30.540
 And he kept selling it, but keeping a leg,

00:33:30.540 --> 00:33:33.540
 so that it would regenerate to a new one.

00:33:33.540 --> 00:33:36.860
 - What a brilliant business model.

00:33:36.860 --> 00:33:38.420
 - That's how I'm thinking.

00:33:38.420 --> 00:33:40.500
 - They're also, the axolotl gets its name

00:33:40.500 --> 00:33:43.180
 from the name of Quetzalcoatl's dog.

00:33:43.180 --> 00:33:44.020
 - Does it?

00:33:44.020 --> 00:33:45.940
 - Yeah, Quetzalcoatl had a dog called axolotl.

00:33:45.940 --> 00:33:47.540
 - Did he think when he went to the vet,

00:33:47.540 --> 00:33:49.620
 it was Quetzalcoatl and axolotl?

00:33:49.620 --> 00:33:52.380
 - Unarmed stick insects,

00:33:52.380 --> 00:33:54.260
 obviously a badly named insect.

00:33:54.260 --> 00:33:55.100
 - Oh, yeah.

00:33:55.100 --> 00:33:57.140
 - And I just want to mention one I found the other day,

00:33:57.140 --> 00:33:59.260
 which is the so-called whispering bat.

00:33:59.260 --> 00:34:02.940
 The so-called whispering bat's call

00:34:02.940 --> 00:34:05.840
 is as loud as a chainsaw or a leaf blower.

00:34:05.840 --> 00:34:06.680
 - Wow.

00:34:06.680 --> 00:34:08.260
 (all laughing)

00:34:08.260 --> 00:34:10.500
 - But the reason it's called the whispering bat

00:34:10.500 --> 00:34:12.460
 is because it's too high-pitched for us to hear.

00:34:12.460 --> 00:34:13.300
 Oh, thank God.

00:34:13.300 --> 00:34:15.700
 Other bats find it deafening.

00:34:15.700 --> 00:34:16.540
 - Yeah, right.

00:34:16.540 --> 00:34:17.380
 - That's funny.

00:34:17.380 --> 00:34:18.860
 - There's so many classic animals

00:34:18.860 --> 00:34:20.780
 that are completely misnamed.

00:34:20.780 --> 00:34:23.820
 So, a few that I found electric eel.

00:34:23.820 --> 00:34:24.660
 - Yes.

00:34:24.660 --> 00:34:25.480
 - Not an eel.

00:34:25.480 --> 00:34:26.320
 - No.

00:34:26.320 --> 00:34:27.860
 - It's a knife fish.

00:34:27.860 --> 00:34:29.020
 The horny toad.

00:34:29.020 --> 00:34:30.340
 - Yep, lizard.

00:34:30.340 --> 00:34:31.180
 - It's a lizard.

00:34:31.180 --> 00:34:32.020
 - Doesn't have much sex.

00:34:32.020 --> 00:34:33.340
 - Doesn't have much sex.

00:34:33.340 --> 00:34:34.180
 - Very sad.

00:34:34.180 --> 00:34:35.140
 - King Cobra's.

00:34:35.140 --> 00:34:35.980
 - Not.

00:34:35.980 --> 00:34:36.820
 - Not Royals.

00:34:36.820 --> 00:34:38.300
 (all laughing)

00:34:38.300 --> 00:34:39.340
 - Not Cobra's.

00:34:39.340 --> 00:34:40.180
 - No, really?

00:34:40.180 --> 00:34:41.020
 - Oh, Cobra's.

00:34:41.020 --> 00:34:42.780
 - Wow, skipjack tuner, not a tuner.

00:34:42.780 --> 00:34:43.620
 - Really?

00:34:43.620 --> 00:34:44.460
 - Is it really?

00:34:44.460 --> 00:34:45.420
 - That's the one that's always on all the tins, isn't it?

00:34:45.420 --> 00:34:46.260
 It's not tuner.

00:34:46.260 --> 00:34:47.260
 It's a completely different genus.

00:34:47.260 --> 00:34:48.620
 - Really?

00:34:48.620 --> 00:34:49.900
 Huh.

00:34:49.900 --> 00:34:50.780
 - Mountain goat?

00:34:50.780 --> 00:34:51.620
 Not a mountain.

00:34:51.620 --> 00:34:53.100
 No, not a goat.

00:34:53.100 --> 00:34:53.940
 - Really?

00:34:53.940 --> 00:34:54.760
 - What?

00:34:54.760 --> 00:34:55.600
 - No.

00:34:55.600 --> 00:34:56.440
 - The list goes on.

00:34:56.440 --> 00:34:57.280
 - Yeah, it does, actually.

00:34:57.280 --> 00:34:59.380
 Mantis shrimp, neither a shrimp nor a mantis.

00:34:59.380 --> 00:35:01.820
 American buffalo's not a buffalo but a bison.

00:35:01.820 --> 00:35:04.660
 Do you know the difference between a buffalo and a bison?

00:35:04.660 --> 00:35:05.820
 - No, I don't, Mr. Hope.

00:35:05.820 --> 00:35:07.160
 (all laughing)

00:35:07.160 --> 00:35:08.900
 - You can't wash your hands on a buffalo.

00:35:08.900 --> 00:35:11.480
 (all laughing)

00:35:11.480 --> 00:35:17.820
 - Okay, it is time for our final fact of the show,

00:35:17.820 --> 00:35:19.760
 and that is loedy.

00:35:20.700 --> 00:35:23.940
 So, I still have to decide which fact to give to you,

00:35:23.940 --> 00:35:25.220
 and I just want to give you some

00:35:25.220 --> 00:35:27.260
 that I didn't choose in the end.

00:35:27.260 --> 00:35:28.860
 (all laughing)

00:35:28.860 --> 00:35:29.700
 - That was a first.

00:35:29.700 --> 00:35:30.900
 - 'Cause I don't want to waste them.

00:35:30.900 --> 00:35:33.500
 To keep warm in the 16th and 17th centuries,

00:35:33.500 --> 00:35:37.020
 boys at British public schools burned the furniture.

00:35:37.020 --> 00:35:39.340
 Horrible, a bit like my school.

00:35:39.340 --> 00:35:40.980
 John Denver's wife, Annie,

00:35:40.980 --> 00:35:42.580
 claimed to have fallen in love with him

00:35:42.580 --> 00:35:45.620
 despite his songs, not because of them.

00:35:45.620 --> 00:35:46.460
 That's very sad.

00:35:46.460 --> 00:35:49.300
 And Toad Suck, Arkansas, recently won a survey

00:35:49.300 --> 00:35:51.740
 to find America's most unfortunate place name,

00:35:51.740 --> 00:35:53.620
 beating Belchartown, Massachusetts,

00:35:53.620 --> 00:35:56.300
 Climax, Georgia, Hooker, Oklahoma,

00:35:56.300 --> 00:35:58.460
 and Rochetown, Illinois.

00:35:58.460 --> 00:36:00.920
 - Well, I'm glad that you didn't do that low-brow one, John.

00:36:00.920 --> 00:36:02.260
 (all laughing)

00:36:02.260 --> 00:36:04.140
 What is your actual fact this week?

00:36:04.140 --> 00:36:08.580
 - My fact is, 45% of Britons do not know

00:36:08.580 --> 00:36:10.020
 where their rectum is.

00:36:10.020 --> 00:36:13.180
 (all laughing)

00:36:13.180 --> 00:36:15.460
 Now, this was according to a poll

00:36:15.460 --> 00:36:18.180
 of 2,000 British adults.

00:36:19.100 --> 00:36:22.060
 Commissioned by Powell Mell Medical Private Health Care

00:36:22.060 --> 00:36:24.780
 in January, 2023.

00:36:24.780 --> 00:36:27.540
 Only 55% of men and women in Britain

00:36:27.540 --> 00:36:30.980
 can confidently state where their rectum is.

00:36:30.980 --> 00:36:34.100
 And only 50% know where their reproductive organs are.

00:36:34.100 --> 00:36:36.340
 - No. - That is impossible.

00:36:36.340 --> 00:36:38.260
 Now, I can sort of understand why this might be

00:36:38.260 --> 00:36:40.020
 because they don't know what the words mean,

00:36:40.020 --> 00:36:42.020
 rectum and reproductive organs.

00:36:42.020 --> 00:36:44.060
 But according to the survey also,

00:36:44.060 --> 00:36:46.980
 an astonishing 37% of Brits

00:36:46.980 --> 00:36:50.420
 cannot say where either their heart or their brain is.

00:36:50.420 --> 00:36:52.020
 (all laughing)

00:36:52.020 --> 00:36:54.260
 - Well, my brain isn't my reproductive system.

00:36:54.260 --> 00:36:57.460
 (all laughing)

00:36:57.460 --> 00:36:58.860
 - 'Cause there's that saying, isn't there?

00:36:58.860 --> 00:37:01.820
 He couldn't find his ass with both hands, yes.

00:37:01.820 --> 00:37:04.820
 And what we're saying is that 45% of British people

00:37:04.820 --> 00:37:05.940
 fall into that. - I don't think we're saying that

00:37:05.940 --> 00:37:08.220
 because to find your rectum with your hands

00:37:08.220 --> 00:37:09.940
 is quite an invasive thing.

00:37:09.940 --> 00:37:11.580
 (all laughing)

00:37:11.580 --> 00:37:13.100
 - Well, I did look it up because I thought,

00:37:13.100 --> 00:37:15.140
 okay, well, that's how ridiculous that is.

00:37:15.140 --> 00:37:18.700
 But I didn't know until yesterday

00:37:18.700 --> 00:37:19.980
 which part of the rectum is,

00:37:19.980 --> 00:37:21.340
 but you know, you've all looked that up.

00:37:21.340 --> 00:37:23.060
 So it's not actually what you think.

00:37:23.060 --> 00:37:25.300
 It's not the anus. - Not the heart.

00:37:25.300 --> 00:37:29.100
 - It's in, there's the anal canal with the anus on one end

00:37:29.100 --> 00:37:30.180
 and then the other end is the rectum,

00:37:30.180 --> 00:37:31.620
 which is basically the poo park

00:37:31.620 --> 00:37:34.380
 where the stuff that comes down the colon

00:37:34.380 --> 00:37:35.740
 is being digested all the way

00:37:35.740 --> 00:37:36.980
 and then it goes into the rectum,

00:37:36.980 --> 00:37:38.820
 which is exactly, it's the storage thing.

00:37:38.820 --> 00:37:39.660
 - Right. - Until--

00:37:39.660 --> 00:37:41.260
 - Is that a medical term, the poo park?

00:37:41.260 --> 00:37:43.460
 (all laughing)

00:37:43.460 --> 00:37:46.820
 - Yeah, same with vagina, I think, as well.

00:37:46.820 --> 00:37:48.780
 Like people think it's the opening,

00:37:48.780 --> 00:37:50.420
 but it's the tube. - Yes.

00:37:50.420 --> 00:37:51.260
 - So that's interesting.

00:37:51.260 --> 00:37:53.340
 I thought the rectum was connected

00:37:53.340 --> 00:37:55.300
 from sort of the bottom of the intestine

00:37:55.300 --> 00:37:57.020
 right to the opening. - No.

00:37:57.020 --> 00:37:58.220
 - I thought that whole thing--

00:37:58.220 --> 00:38:00.220
 - Okay, we've got this, we've covered them.

00:38:00.220 --> 00:38:03.060
 - Count me as one of the 55.

00:38:03.060 --> 00:38:04.860
 - The interesting thing about this survey was

00:38:04.860 --> 00:38:06.060
 it wasn't testing, can you find this?

00:38:06.060 --> 00:38:07.500
 It was saying, are you confident

00:38:07.500 --> 00:38:10.280
 that you could locate where organ X is?

00:38:10.280 --> 00:38:11.120
 - That's interesting.

00:38:11.120 --> 00:38:13.820
 So an 8% of people said they could confidently

00:38:13.820 --> 00:38:14.660
 identify none of them.

00:38:14.660 --> 00:38:15.500
 - None of them?

00:38:15.500 --> 00:38:17.500
 - They just said no, I couldn't identify any.

00:38:17.500 --> 00:38:19.700
 - But surely the brain, everybody must know.

00:38:19.700 --> 00:38:20.820
 - You would think so, yeah.

00:38:20.820 --> 00:38:22.820
 - That's just people with no confidence.

00:38:22.820 --> 00:38:24.140
 - Exactly. - Yeah, it's a confidence thing.

00:38:24.140 --> 00:38:25.620
 - Although we have said before

00:38:25.620 --> 00:38:27.900
 that there is this thing in,

00:38:27.900 --> 00:38:30.380
 is it called Lizardman's Constant or something like that,

00:38:30.380 --> 00:38:33.100
 where in any survey, you will get a percent

00:38:33.100 --> 00:38:35.180
 who will just give a ridiculous answer.

00:38:35.180 --> 00:38:37.900
 - I did wonder whether people,

00:38:37.900 --> 00:38:39.820
 because it was an online survey,

00:38:39.820 --> 00:38:41.520
 it wasn't a person asking my eye to eye.

00:38:41.520 --> 00:38:43.920
 So you wonder, people had a bit too much to drink,

00:38:43.920 --> 00:38:44.880
 they think, oh, I'll just put.

00:38:44.880 --> 00:38:45.720
 - Yeah.

00:38:45.720 --> 00:38:46.880
 - But there was another thing at the other end

00:38:46.880 --> 00:38:48.800
 of the spectrum on this survey,

00:38:48.800 --> 00:38:50.760
 'cause you know, people not identifying

00:38:50.760 --> 00:38:52.280
 where their brain is sounds mad.

00:38:52.280 --> 00:38:54.920
 I also would like to call a slight doubt

00:38:54.920 --> 00:38:57.720
 over the 24% of people, quite high,

00:38:57.720 --> 00:38:59.560
 who claimed they could confidently identify

00:38:59.560 --> 00:39:01.360
 where their pancreas was.

00:39:01.360 --> 00:39:04.120
 - Oh no. - And I think, come on.

00:39:04.120 --> 00:39:06.680
 - Like, I know it's in the middle section, but.

00:39:06.680 --> 00:39:08.160
 - Yeah, yeah, but where?

00:39:08.160 --> 00:39:10.620
 - Well, like the spleen, that was the one,

00:39:10.620 --> 00:39:12.860
 20% claimed to know where their spleen was.

00:39:12.860 --> 00:39:15.020
 I wouldn't have any idea, would give me a break.

00:39:15.020 --> 00:39:17.780
 - Yeah, 20% are not spleen doctors.

00:39:17.780 --> 00:39:19.220
 What's the term, I don't know.

00:39:19.220 --> 00:39:20.580
 - Splenologists?

00:39:20.580 --> 00:39:22.060
 - What's a speleologist?

00:39:22.060 --> 00:39:23.060
 - That's a screwdriver.

00:39:23.060 --> 00:39:25.020
 - Oh no, that's been a terrible mistake.

00:39:25.020 --> 00:39:28.300
 - Don't worry, he's gonna carry out the operation anyway.

00:39:28.300 --> 00:39:30.300
 He says it'll be just like a cave, probably.

00:39:30.300 --> 00:39:32.820
 - He's never been in an anal canal before.

00:39:32.820 --> 00:39:34.580
 - I tend to do a lot of these things now

00:39:34.580 --> 00:39:37.300
 when I'm trying to get access to a news article online.

00:39:37.300 --> 00:39:40.400
 - They often, a lot of websites will have like,

00:39:40.400 --> 00:39:42.740
 just fill this quick survey in quickly and.

00:39:42.740 --> 00:39:44.100
 - See the way your rectum is.

00:39:44.100 --> 00:39:45.440
 - Yeah.

00:39:45.440 --> 00:39:47.920
 - What kind of websites are you trying to get onto then?

00:39:47.920 --> 00:39:49.560
 - Please turn on your webcam.

00:39:49.560 --> 00:39:53.520
 Show us your rectum.

00:39:53.520 --> 00:39:55.160
 - I find it interesting that don't knows

00:39:55.160 --> 00:39:56.280
 in surveys as well.

00:39:56.280 --> 00:39:59.040
 And so YouGov always include their don't knows.

00:39:59.040 --> 00:40:00.720
 And there was an article about this in Wired

00:40:00.720 --> 00:40:03.080
 a few years ago by a writer called Amit Katwala.

00:40:03.080 --> 00:40:04.800
 And it's a great point 'cause YouGov

00:40:04.800 --> 00:40:06.640
 did a survey about surfing, right?

00:40:06.640 --> 00:40:09.140
 Have you ever been surfing or not?

00:40:09.140 --> 00:40:12.380
 In which 3% of people said, "I don't know."

00:40:12.380 --> 00:40:16.900
 And it's a big thing to not know if you've tried surfing.

00:40:16.900 --> 00:40:19.180
 2% don't know if they've lived in London.

00:40:19.180 --> 00:40:20.700
 (laughing)

00:40:20.700 --> 00:40:22.100
 - They could be on the outskirts.

00:40:22.100 --> 00:40:24.220
 - Possible, yeah, I guess, yeah.

00:40:24.220 --> 00:40:25.980
 - All born in London but left straight away.

00:40:25.980 --> 00:40:27.820
 Oh, I don't know if we've lived there for a couple of months.

00:40:27.820 --> 00:40:29.420
 - Okay, here's one from 2023.

00:40:29.420 --> 00:40:31.660
 Do you and your romantic partner each have your own side

00:40:31.660 --> 00:40:33.940
 of the bed that you sleep on, okay?

00:40:33.940 --> 00:40:35.260
 And if you don't currently have a partner,

00:40:35.260 --> 00:40:36.600
 please think about the last partner you have.

00:40:36.600 --> 00:40:38.720
 77% we each have our own side.

00:40:38.720 --> 00:40:42.680
 4% chaotic, we sleep on whichever side, absolutely insane.

00:40:42.680 --> 00:40:44.220
 But 6% don't know.

00:40:44.220 --> 00:40:45.160
 - Yeah.

00:40:45.160 --> 00:40:46.160
 - How do you not know?

00:40:46.160 --> 00:40:47.800
 - I would say it would be different depending

00:40:47.800 --> 00:40:49.360
 on which bed you're sleeping in.

00:40:49.360 --> 00:40:51.920
 Like in our home bed, we sleep on the same size.

00:40:51.920 --> 00:40:53.400
 But if you go to a hotel.

00:40:53.400 --> 00:40:54.240
 - Then it's anything goes.

00:40:54.240 --> 00:40:55.240
 Completely. - Exactly.

00:40:55.240 --> 00:40:57.280
 Well, it's not, it's whatever my wife wants to do.

00:40:57.280 --> 00:40:59.040
 (laughing)

00:40:59.040 --> 00:41:02.320
 - In 2017, a survey found that half of British gardeners

00:41:02.320 --> 00:41:05.040
 cannot name a single shrub.

00:41:05.040 --> 00:41:08.900
 And the next year in 2018, a poll found that 80% of Britons

00:41:08.900 --> 00:41:11.940
 couldn't pick out their own neighbors in a police lineup.

00:41:11.940 --> 00:41:13.100
 I thought that was quite strong.

00:41:13.100 --> 00:41:14.420
 - That's interesting.

00:41:14.420 --> 00:41:15.340
 - And how did they test that?

00:41:15.340 --> 00:41:17.220
 Did they do some lineups?

00:41:17.220 --> 00:41:18.620
 I'd like to know that, yes.

00:41:18.620 --> 00:41:19.460
 - That'd be great.

00:41:19.460 --> 00:41:21.780
 - It wasn't a Daily Mail, though, so maybe it's...

00:41:21.780 --> 00:41:22.780
 - Can you name a shrub?

00:41:22.780 --> 00:41:24.780
 'Cause I think shrub,

00:41:24.780 --> 00:41:27.340
 is that like a specific type of plant is a shrub?

00:41:27.340 --> 00:41:30.220
 - I agree, I mean, I garden, and you know.

00:41:30.220 --> 00:41:31.740
 - I have something that looks like a shrub,

00:41:31.740 --> 00:41:34.380
 which is Nazalia, is that a shrub?

00:41:34.380 --> 00:41:35.220
 - I don't know.

00:41:35.220 --> 00:41:38.040
 - Is it a little Leylandi bush, a shrub?

00:41:38.040 --> 00:41:39.560
 - A bush is a part of the body, isn't it?

00:41:39.560 --> 00:41:40.400
 I think that...

00:41:40.400 --> 00:41:41.560
 (laughing)

00:41:41.560 --> 00:41:43.160
 - Most people don't know why that is.

00:41:43.160 --> 00:41:44.600
 - I don't know where their bush is.

00:41:44.600 --> 00:41:46.200
 (laughing)

00:41:46.200 --> 00:41:48.000
 - Well, let's think of a shrub, it must be a shrub.

00:41:48.000 --> 00:41:50.200
 Is it a laurel, is that a tree?

00:41:50.200 --> 00:41:51.320
 - I think that's a shrub, is it?

00:41:51.320 --> 00:41:52.840
 - I think it's a size thing, isn't it?

00:41:52.840 --> 00:41:54.440
 Over a certain size, a shrub becomes a tree.

00:41:54.440 --> 00:41:56.680
 - I think we've shown that this is a very difficult thing

00:41:56.680 --> 00:41:57.520
 to know.

00:41:57.520 --> 00:41:58.360
 (laughing)

00:41:58.360 --> 00:41:59.400
 - We always jump when you're on the show,

00:41:59.400 --> 00:42:01.000
 we get into the deep questions.

00:42:01.000 --> 00:42:02.680
 (laughing)

00:42:02.680 --> 00:42:04.320
 - Can I do one more survey?

00:42:04.320 --> 00:42:05.620
 - Just this is a silly survey,

00:42:05.620 --> 00:42:07.020
 it's not really that much on topic,

00:42:07.020 --> 00:42:09.260
 but there was a poll quite recently

00:42:09.260 --> 00:42:13.100
 about what Britons aged 18 to 29,

00:42:13.100 --> 00:42:15.700
 so this is young people according to the survey.

00:42:15.700 --> 00:42:19.820
 What is the least cool hand gesture a person can make?

00:42:19.820 --> 00:42:21.100
 - Oh, that's great! - Just that it's a good quiz.

00:42:21.100 --> 00:42:22.180
 - Yeah, okay, cool.

00:42:22.180 --> 00:42:23.420
 - Okay, can I have a punt?

00:42:23.420 --> 00:42:24.260
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:42:24.260 --> 00:42:27.780
 - I think the peace sign is not cool.

00:42:27.780 --> 00:42:29.100
 - Oh, do you know, I do that all the time.

00:42:29.100 --> 00:42:30.580
 - I do it all the time, but I just don't,

00:42:30.580 --> 00:42:31.500
 I don't think it's cool.

00:42:31.500 --> 00:42:32.340
 - Oh, okay.

00:42:32.340 --> 00:42:34.700
 - Possibly the horns, the rock horns.

00:42:34.700 --> 00:42:38.100
 - Oh, that's like a cuckold in Southern Europe.

00:42:38.100 --> 00:42:38.940
 - Oh, yeah.

00:42:38.940 --> 00:42:39.780
 (laughing)

00:42:39.780 --> 00:42:40.620
 - No, it's not that.

00:42:40.620 --> 00:42:42.100
 - Careful at Southern European Metallica gigs,

00:42:42.100 --> 00:42:43.600
 which I know you love to go to, Dan.

00:42:43.600 --> 00:42:45.820
 (laughing)

00:42:45.820 --> 00:42:46.660
 - The thumbs up.

00:42:46.660 --> 00:42:47.500
 - The thumbs up.

00:42:47.500 --> 00:42:49.720
 - Thumbs up, that was in the poll.

00:42:49.720 --> 00:42:50.620
 It wasn't the worst,

00:42:50.620 --> 00:42:52.500
 but a lot of people thought it was quite cringe.

00:42:52.500 --> 00:42:53.420
 - A-okay.

00:42:53.420 --> 00:42:54.980
 - That was cringe, but not the worst.

00:42:54.980 --> 00:42:55.820
 - The phone, call me.

00:42:55.820 --> 00:42:57.300
 - In fact, the double A-okay

00:42:57.300 --> 00:42:59.540
 is one of the most cringe-worthy signs.

00:42:59.540 --> 00:43:00.740
 - Oh, air quotes!

00:43:00.740 --> 00:43:01.580
 Are they the--

00:43:01.580 --> 00:43:02.420
 - Yeah, that's pretty good.

00:43:02.420 --> 00:43:03.260
 - The most now.

00:43:03.260 --> 00:43:04.980
 - I actually think if anyone had thought of that,

00:43:04.980 --> 00:43:06.380
 they would have gone for it.

00:43:06.380 --> 00:43:07.700
 Hey, John, do you want to have a guess or?

00:43:07.700 --> 00:43:08.700
 - Wankings.

00:43:08.700 --> 00:43:10.740
 - Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:43:10.740 --> 00:43:12.740
 - Sorry, Philippa Perry.

00:43:12.740 --> 00:43:14.660
 She basically answered the word "wank"

00:43:14.660 --> 00:43:16.980
 for every question we asked her as she came on the show.

00:43:16.980 --> 00:43:19.100
 (laughing)

00:43:19.100 --> 00:43:22.940
 It is, and this is 38% of people said this.

00:43:22.940 --> 00:43:25.220
 It's playing an air guitar.

00:43:25.220 --> 00:43:26.180
 - Oh!

00:43:26.180 --> 00:43:28.980
 - Like a Wild Stallions' Bill and Ted thing.

00:43:28.980 --> 00:43:29.980
 - That is pretty embarrassing.

00:43:29.980 --> 00:43:30.980
 - Oh, come on, it's cool.

00:43:30.980 --> 00:43:31.820
 (laughing)

00:43:31.820 --> 00:43:32.660
 - Okay.

00:43:32.660 --> 00:43:33.660
 - How old are you, Dad?

00:43:33.660 --> 00:43:34.980
 (laughing)

00:43:34.980 --> 00:43:37.460
 - The right age, to know that's cool.

00:43:37.460 --> 00:43:39.660
 Rectum?

00:43:39.660 --> 00:43:41.660
 - Okay, let's talk rectums.

00:43:41.660 --> 00:43:44.700
 The US Consumer Product Safety Commission every year

00:43:44.700 --> 00:43:46.340
 do a list of things that have been found

00:43:46.340 --> 00:43:48.180
 in people's orifices.

00:43:48.180 --> 00:43:49.020
 - Really?

00:43:49.020 --> 00:43:53.060
 - Yeah, the 2022 list include a monopoly piece,

00:43:53.060 --> 00:43:57.020
 a reusable ice pack, a fishing pole.

00:43:57.020 --> 00:43:57.860
 - No.

00:43:57.860 --> 00:43:58.700
 (laughing)

00:43:58.700 --> 00:44:00.180
 - It can't have been the entire pole.

00:44:00.180 --> 00:44:01.300
 - Well, they're collapsible, aren't they?

00:44:01.300 --> 00:44:02.140
 - They collapse, yeah.

00:44:02.140 --> 00:44:02.960
 - Oh, do they?

00:44:02.960 --> 00:44:03.800
 - Yeah.

00:44:03.800 --> 00:44:05.180
 - Yeah, okay, well, it could have been that.

00:44:05.180 --> 00:44:08.860
 And in other orifices, a golf ball in the vagina,

00:44:08.860 --> 00:44:11.060
 an expensive coin from a coin collection

00:44:11.060 --> 00:44:14.660
 in someone's throat and a USB card in someone's penis.

00:44:14.660 --> 00:44:16.540
 - Oh, a USB?

00:44:16.540 --> 00:44:17.380
 - Yeah.

00:44:17.380 --> 00:44:18.220
 (laughing)

00:44:18.220 --> 00:44:19.060
 - It's brilliant.

00:44:19.060 --> 00:44:19.900
 - You've got to make sure you put it in the right way round.

00:44:19.900 --> 00:44:21.540
 - Yeah, exactly.

00:44:21.540 --> 00:44:23.180
 Wow, that's brilliant.

00:44:23.180 --> 00:44:25.860
 Yeah, there was a guy also a 68-year-old man

00:44:25.860 --> 00:44:28.700
 with hemorrhoids in Hubei province in China

00:44:28.700 --> 00:44:32.700
 who had to have a 10-inch chopstick pulled out of his anus,

00:44:32.700 --> 00:44:33.540
 which he put up there.

00:44:33.540 --> 00:44:35.240
 He said, "Out of curiosity."

00:44:35.240 --> 00:44:37.660
 (laughing)

00:44:37.660 --> 00:44:38.500
 - Fair play, yeah.

00:44:38.500 --> 00:44:41.060
 - I haven't listened to the Museum of Curiosity this series.

00:44:41.060 --> 00:44:42.140
 John, is there?

00:44:42.140 --> 00:44:42.980
 (laughing)

00:44:42.980 --> 00:44:44.460
 - I'd like to donate this chopstick.

00:44:44.460 --> 00:44:46.180
 (laughing)

00:44:46.180 --> 00:44:49.180
 - And just while I was talking about emergency visits

00:44:49.180 --> 00:44:54.140
 in 2022, I found a list of quite a few here or some.

00:44:54.140 --> 00:44:55.460
 This is in the U.S.

00:44:55.460 --> 00:44:58.580
 "Pain after rubbing penis too hard with a loofah."

00:44:58.580 --> 00:45:01.820
 "Playing with pocket knife, accidentally stabbed penis.

00:45:01.820 --> 00:45:03.620
 "Closed penis in fridge door."

00:45:03.620 --> 00:45:05.300
 (laughing)

00:45:05.300 --> 00:45:09.060
 "And watched football, got excited when team scored

00:45:09.060 --> 00:45:11.920
 "and accidentally punched self in penis."

00:45:11.920 --> 00:45:12.760
 - Oh.

00:45:12.760 --> 00:45:13.600
 (laughing)

00:45:13.600 --> 00:45:16.260
 - Here are all ER visits in the U.S. last year.

00:45:16.260 --> 00:45:17.260
 - That's amazing.

00:45:17.260 --> 00:45:19.840
 (upbeat music)

00:45:19.840 --> 00:45:23.140
 - Okay, that's it.

00:45:23.140 --> 00:45:24.180
 That is all of our facts.

00:45:24.180 --> 00:45:25.540
 Thank you so much for listening.

00:45:25.540 --> 00:45:27.540
 If you'd like to get in contact with any of us

00:45:27.540 --> 00:45:29.260

00:45:29.260 --> 00:45:31.820
 of this podcast, we can be found on our Twitter accounts.

00:45:31.820 --> 00:45:33.820

00:45:41.940 --> 00:45:43.660
 - Oh, yeah, of course.

00:45:43.660 --> 00:45:45.020
 - I don't know, I didn't have a special account.

00:45:45.020 --> 00:45:46.940
 - Yeah, yeah, or @Quickipedia, I guess,

00:45:46.940 --> 00:45:48.700
 for like the total hub.

00:45:48.700 --> 00:45:50.380
 But yeah, find @Loydie on Instagram.

00:45:50.380 --> 00:45:51.620
 - But we do Instagrams.

00:45:51.620 --> 00:45:52.460
 - Yeah.

00:45:52.460 --> 00:45:53.300
 - Yeah, we've done that before.

00:45:53.300 --> 00:45:54.140
 - That's a good point.

00:45:54.140 --> 00:45:54.980
 Well, I'm on @Sriberland.

00:45:54.980 --> 00:45:57.020
 - I'm on no such thing as James Harkin.

00:45:57.020 --> 00:45:58.620
 - Mine is private, you'll never find it.

00:45:58.620 --> 00:46:00.060
 (laughing)

00:46:00.060 --> 00:46:02.820
 - And mine is @JohnLloydQI.

00:46:02.820 --> 00:46:05.740
 - All right, and we don't have a fish Instagram,

00:46:05.740 --> 00:46:07.620
 but we do have a fish Twitter account,

00:46:07.620 --> 00:46:08.860
 which is @NoSuchThing.

00:46:08.860 --> 00:46:09.940
 Or you can go to our website,

00:46:09.940 --> 00:46:11.820
 which is NoSuchThingasafish.com.

00:46:11.820 --> 00:46:14.620
 Do check it out, all the previous episodes are up there.

00:46:14.620 --> 00:46:15.740
 And that's it for now.

00:46:15.740 --> 00:46:17.860
 We'll be back again next week with another episode.

00:46:17.860 --> 00:46:19.900
 Thank you, John, for officially opening

00:46:19.900 --> 00:46:22.700
 the new QI offices and podcasting headquarters.

00:46:22.700 --> 00:46:23.820
 - That's an honor, Daniel.

00:46:23.820 --> 00:46:25.580
 - And yeah, we'll be back again next week

00:46:25.580 --> 00:46:26.580
 with another episode.

00:46:26.580 --> 00:46:28.540
 We'll see you then, goodbye.

00:46:28.540 --> 00:46:31.120
 (upbeat music)

00:46:31.120 --> 00:46:33.700
 (upbeat music)

00:46:34.540 --> 00:46:37.120
 (upbeat music)

00:46:37.120 --> 00:46:39.700
 (upbeat music)
