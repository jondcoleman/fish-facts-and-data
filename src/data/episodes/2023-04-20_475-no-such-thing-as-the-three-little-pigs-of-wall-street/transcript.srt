1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,580
 (upbeat music)

2
00:00:02,580 --> 00:00:17,260
 - Hello and welcome to another episode

3
00:00:17,260 --> 00:00:20,500
 of No Such Thing as a Fish, a weekly podcast coming to you

4
00:00:20,500 --> 00:00:24,260
 for the first time from the new QI offices in Hoburn.

5
00:00:24,260 --> 00:00:25,420
 My name is Dan Schreiber.

6
00:00:25,420 --> 00:00:27,620
 I am sitting here with Andrew Hunter Murray,

7
00:00:27,620 --> 00:00:30,680
 James Harkin and here to cut the red ribbon

8
00:00:30,680 --> 00:00:33,820
 and officially open the new Fish podcasting headquarters

9
00:00:33,820 --> 00:00:36,440
 is the founder of QI himself, John Lloyd.

10
00:00:36,440 --> 00:00:38,960
 And once again, we have gathered around the microphones

11
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:41,560
 with our four favorite facts from the last seven days.

12
00:00:41,560 --> 00:00:44,600
 And in no particular order, here we go.

13
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:48,040
 Starting with fact number one, that is Andy.

14
00:00:48,040 --> 00:00:50,840
 My fact is that there was a job in medieval times

15
00:00:50,840 --> 00:00:52,740
 called the municipal swine herd

16
00:00:52,740 --> 00:00:56,120
 who was effectively a professional pig walker for city dwellers

17
00:00:56,120 --> 00:00:58,440
 who didn't want to walk their own pigs.

18
00:00:58,440 --> 00:00:59,280
 - Right.

19
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:01,780
 (laughing)

20
00:01:01,780 --> 00:01:03,880
 - It's just a job that you used to be able to get.

21
00:01:03,880 --> 00:01:05,000
 Before we go any further, actually,

22
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,880
 I should say this fact was sent in to us

23
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:11,120
 at podcast@qi.com by a listener sent in by Andrew Salamone.

24
00:01:11,120 --> 00:01:13,200
 So thank you very much indeed for it, Andrew.

25
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:14,800
 - Were they on leashes?

26
00:01:14,800 --> 00:01:16,920
 - No, I don't think they were.

27
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:19,280
 - That's a more difficult job than I reckon

28
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:22,320
 'cause you're corraling the pigs as well as walking them.

29
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:23,400
 - It's difficult in that way,

30
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:24,320
 but it's also very hard.

31
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:25,680
 I imagine to keep a pig on a leash

32
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:26,640
 if it doesn't want to be.

33
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:27,480
 - Is it?

34
00:01:27,480 --> 00:01:28,320
 - Really?

35
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:29,160
 The pigs are very strong.

36
00:01:29,160 --> 00:01:31,640
 - But they're also very intelligent and can be trained.

37
00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:33,200
 You can teach a pig to dance.

38
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:34,160
 - No, you're right.

39
00:01:34,160 --> 00:01:36,400
 Well, yeah, I don't think they were.

40
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:38,120
 This was in the middle ages.

41
00:01:38,120 --> 00:01:39,400
 - Sorry, John, can I just pick you up on,

42
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:41,560
 you can teach a pig to dance?

43
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:42,800
 - Yeah, well, they're very intelligent.

44
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:43,720
 (laughing)

45
00:01:43,720 --> 00:01:46,100
 They're right at the top of the animal league,

46
00:01:46,100 --> 00:01:48,240
 smarter than dogs, sheep, and horses.

47
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:50,800
 They can be house trained, taught to fetch, come to heal.

48
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:53,440
 They can pull carts, they can sniff out landmines.

49
00:01:53,440 --> 00:01:55,600
 - But can I bring you back to the dancing point?

50
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:56,680
 Pigs can dance.

51
00:01:56,680 --> 00:01:58,240
 - Apparently they can, yes.

52
00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:00,600
 - Were they sort of like vaudeville acts or?

53
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:01,920
 - It's mainly flamenco dancing.

54
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:03,920
 (laughing)

55
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:06,720
 They'd click their little heels together like castanets.

56
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:07,560
 - Brilliant.

57
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:09,200
 - They like watching television.

58
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:11,600
 They have their own favorite programs, pet pigs.

59
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:12,520
 - Peppa Pig?

60
00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:14,240
 - I don't know if Peppa Pig can watch television.

61
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:15,640
 - No, I was wondering if Peppa Pig

62
00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:17,440
 was one of their favorite TV shows.

63
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:18,440
 - I'm sorry to be late to this,

64
00:02:18,440 --> 00:02:20,920
 but the Fox Trotter would be an example

65
00:02:20,920 --> 00:02:21,760
 of a dancer pig could do.

66
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:24,880
 - And Southpawk would be a TV show they might like.

67
00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:25,720
 - There we go.

68
00:02:25,720 --> 00:02:26,560
 - Southpawk.

69
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:27,600
 (laughing)

70
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:29,400
 - Should we stragg us away from this one?

71
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:30,240
 - Oh yeah, sorry, yeah, yeah.

72
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:32,800
 Back into the middle late as we go, hooray.

73
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:36,040
 So these are the first professional pig husbands,

74
00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:37,720
 I guess you would call them in Europe.

75
00:02:37,720 --> 00:02:39,000
 They were these village swine herds,

76
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:42,000
 and it was in a time when everyone had their own pig.

77
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,280
 A pig was an amazingly useful thing to have.

78
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:46,840
 It was a waste disposal unit,

79
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:49,280
 but it was a waste disposal unit made of pork.

80
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:50,640
 What a delicious--

81
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:51,840
 - Go into that a bit more?

82
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:54,160
 - You feed it leftovers and scraps from the household,

83
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:55,960
 and then when winter comes, you eat the pig.

84
00:02:55,960 --> 00:02:57,760
 - It's like if you can eat your wheely bin.

85
00:02:57,760 --> 00:02:59,360
 - Yeah, 'cause no, in the Flintstones,

86
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:02,240
 that's what they, the trash is a dinosaur

87
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:04,400
 that eats the trash sitting in a drawer.

88
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:05,240
 So it's kind of like that.

89
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:07,000
 - It's probably based on these academic studies

90
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,920
 of medieval municipal swine herds, yeah.

91
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:12,040
 And there was a pig daycare thing, though,

92
00:03:12,040 --> 00:03:14,760
 because you didn't want to look after your own pig all day,

93
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:18,000
 being a busy middle-class peasant in the middle ages,

94
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,360
 and you would have a village swine herd

95
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:24,360
 who was rewarded with a sucking pig each year

96
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:27,480
 and the entrails of any animal which had been slaughtered.

97
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:28,320
 So--

98
00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:29,680
 - What did the sucking pig actually do,

99
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:31,200
 or is that a vulgar question?

100
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:32,560
 (laughing)

101
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:34,560
 - You said they could be trained to do anything, John,

102
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:35,400
 is that it?

103
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:37,640
 (laughing)

104
00:03:37,640 --> 00:03:39,640
 - But they are party animals pigs.

105
00:03:39,640 --> 00:03:44,400
 Some pig farmers keep lights on in the sky at night.

106
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:46,040
 When the farmers go home at the end of the day,

107
00:03:46,040 --> 00:03:47,160
 the pigs don't settle down,

108
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:50,040
 they start eating, drinking, and having fun for small hours.

109
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:52,400
 That's actually their favorite show this day at night.

110
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:55,280
 (laughing)

111
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:58,720
 Actually, I read one cool thing about lights in pigsties,

112
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:02,120
 and that is to get rid of the smell in pigsties,

113
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:05,200
 you can paint it with titanium oxide paint

114
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:07,840
 and then fire UV light at the paint,

115
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:10,320
 and that will somehow break down the chemicals,

116
00:04:10,320 --> 00:04:11,880
 which will stop it from smelling.

117
00:04:11,880 --> 00:04:14,040
 And it's even better if you put a disco ball

118
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:15,320
 in the middle of the pigstie,

119
00:04:15,320 --> 00:04:18,520
 it will fire the UV light out in all different directions

120
00:04:18,520 --> 00:04:21,480
 and it will make it smell better more quickly.

121
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:23,080
 - And you know why the disco ball's there

122
00:04:23,080 --> 00:04:23,920
 because of the dance?

123
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:25,080
 - Yes, exactly.

124
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:28,000
 (laughing)

125
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:31,880
 - Medieval pigs don't look like our modern day pig,

126
00:04:31,880 --> 00:04:35,040
 and this is something that has led to a lot of annoyance

127
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:36,160
 in the world of academia,

128
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:38,080
 because a lot of medieval scholars

129
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:39,520
 are constantly finding themselves,

130
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:42,080
 I say constantly, it's one guy as far as I can find,

131
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:43,960
 being pissed off by their representation

132
00:04:43,960 --> 00:04:46,120
 within video games these days.

133
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:48,880
 So there's a lot of video games like Assassin's Creed,

134
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:51,800
 Valhalla, there's Medieval Dynasty Foundation,

135
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:54,240
 where they represent pigs as a modern day pig,

136
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:55,480
 it's pink and it's hairless,

137
00:04:55,480 --> 00:04:57,080
 it looks nothing like the pig is today.

138
00:04:57,080 --> 00:04:58,240
 - Minecraft?

139
00:04:58,240 --> 00:04:59,080
 - Maybe in Minecraft.

140
00:04:59,080 --> 00:04:59,920
 - There are pigs in Minecraft?

141
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:01,000
 - Minecraft, yeah.

142
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,520
 (laughing)

143
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:05,520
 And so actually of the time,

144
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:08,240
 if we wanna picture an old pig,

145
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:11,240
 it's a long legged, they're quite small, long snouts,

146
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:14,840
 very lean figure, they had arch-crested backs,

147
00:05:14,840 --> 00:05:17,640
 and they had long curved tusks as well,

148
00:05:17,640 --> 00:05:18,880
 according to the academic.

149
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:20,680
 - I suppose if you made them look like that

150
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:23,040
 in the video game, people might not realise they were pigs.

151
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:25,680
 - Yeah, and what you've described as a stalk, basically,

152
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:26,720
 as far as I can tell.

153
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:29,000
 (laughing)

154
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:29,840
 - Wow, okay.

155
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:31,720
 - But you mentioned Leeds,

156
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:34,680
 did you know the thing about Gérard de Neval,

157
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:36,480
 the 19th century French poet,

158
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:38,960
 who had a pet lobster called Thibault,

159
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:41,720
 which used to walk around Paris on a blue silk ribbon,

160
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:43,040
 so he did have a lead for the lobster.

161
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:44,360
 - He could walk on a lead.

162
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:46,080
 - He was asked why he had a lobster as a pet,

163
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:48,840
 and he said, "They are peaceful, serious creatures.

164
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:51,560
 "They know the secrets of the sea, and they don't bark."

165
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:52,920
 And it was a very--

166
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:54,920
 - He know the secrets of the sea.

167
00:05:54,920 --> 00:05:57,280
 - It was a very sedate job, 'cause I checked this out.

168
00:05:57,280 --> 00:06:00,600
 In lab tests, the maximum recorded walking speed

169
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:03,400
 of a lobster is 2.5 metres per minute,

170
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:05,680
 or 144 metres an hour.

171
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:08,600
 - That's a good easy job, a professional lobster walker.

172
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:10,160
 - It feels like at some stage,

173
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:12,800
 you would end up dragging a lobster more than walking it,

174
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:13,640
 doesn't it?

175
00:06:13,640 --> 00:06:16,800
 - Maybe you got to get back for lobster dragging.

176
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:20,360
 - I did the other day in a big railway station,

177
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:22,280
 I saw someone who had a ferret on a lead.

178
00:06:22,280 --> 00:06:23,120
 That was nice. - Did you?

179
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:25,160
 - Yeah, which you do see occasionally.

180
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:26,000
 - Yeah. - You know,

181
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:26,840
 'cause they don't need to be--

182
00:06:26,840 --> 00:06:27,680
 - So you pull it out of your trousers.

183
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:30,480
 (all laughing)

184
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:32,760
 - I got sent a picture from my friend Emi in Hong Kong

185
00:06:32,760 --> 00:06:34,600
 of someone walking a lizard on a lead.

186
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:35,760
 - Really? - Like one of those big,

187
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:36,600
 big lizards.

188
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:37,440
 - What, like a commuter dragon?

189
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:38,260
 - Yeah, exactly. - No.

190
00:06:38,260 --> 00:06:39,100
 - But not a commuter dragon.

191
00:06:39,100 --> 00:06:41,160
 No, no, no, but like sizeable.

192
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:43,440
 - Did a real lizard or a shape-shifting lizard?

193
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:44,760
 - It was, yeah, it was one of the members

194
00:06:44,760 --> 00:06:46,880
 of the Royal Family in Hong Kong.

195
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:48,000
 - Monitor, I guess.

196
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:48,960
 - Yeah, it could be.

197
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:50,440
 Yeah.

198
00:06:50,440 --> 00:06:51,480
 - I went into my local,

199
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:55,260
 sorry, no, just bragging about animals we've seen lately,

200
00:06:55,260 --> 00:06:58,840
 but I went into an aquarium shop the other day.

201
00:06:58,840 --> 00:06:59,680
 - Ah, yeah.

202
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:00,720
 - I was trying to buy some--

203
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:01,680
 - Fish.

204
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:03,240
 - Sprintails, actually.

205
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:04,760
 You know, sprintails, there's tiny insects.

206
00:07:04,760 --> 00:07:06,240
 - Yes. - Why do you buy those?

207
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:08,000
 - I needed to fertilize some soil.

208
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,400
 (all laughing)

209
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:14,240
 I did a terrarium workshop and I made a terrarium.

210
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:15,960
 Anyway, I went in there to get my sprintails,

211
00:07:15,960 --> 00:07:17,480
 which was very cheap,

212
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:19,260
 three quid for a big box of sprintails.

213
00:07:19,260 --> 00:07:21,160
 Anyway, they had an axolotl in there.

214
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:22,840
 - Oh, yeah. - I was staggered.

215
00:07:22,840 --> 00:07:24,840
 'Cause I thought, you know, they're very rare.

216
00:07:24,840 --> 00:07:25,680
 - Did you not buy it?

217
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:26,520
 - No. - No.

218
00:07:26,520 --> 00:07:27,360
 - Really interesting. - I didn't know

219
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:28,200
 where to put it.

220
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:29,840
 And the guy who ran the aquarium shop was quite annoyed

221
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:31,760
 'cause he said when he doesn't have an axolotl in,

222
00:07:31,760 --> 00:07:32,920
 people only ever say,

223
00:07:32,920 --> 00:07:34,680
 "Well, do you not have any axolotls?"

224
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:36,040
 And then, when he does,

225
00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:37,360
 they just come in and look at the axolotl

226
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:38,800
 and then don't buy it, you know.

227
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:40,160
 They treat it like a zoo.

228
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:42,120
 - That does feel like one person is going in there

229
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:44,520
 every week as a joke and asking for axolotls.

230
00:07:44,520 --> 00:07:45,480
 (all laughing)

231
00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:47,400
 - Is an axolotl an amphibian?

232
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:48,240
 - Yeah. - I think it is.

233
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:51,480
 - Yeah, 'cause they're extinct in the wild, apparently.

234
00:07:51,480 --> 00:07:54,720
 Yes, they're only in two canals in Mexico City now.

235
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:57,160
 Yeah, apart from zoos.

236
00:07:57,160 --> 00:07:59,920
 And the, because I ask amphibians

237
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:04,440
 because another great medieval job was a frog stoner.

238
00:08:04,440 --> 00:08:07,400
 They used to hire people to throw pebbles into ponds,

239
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:08,760
 shut the frogs up at night.

240
00:08:08,760 --> 00:08:10,160
 (all laughing)

241
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:11,000
 - Partying as well.

242
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,880
 - Yeah, the animal king was all parties.

243
00:08:13,880 --> 00:08:17,120
 But I did think it's a pretty boring job

244
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:19,480
 for a pig walker in the middle ages,

245
00:08:19,480 --> 00:08:21,800
 a municipal swine herd.

246
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:24,160
 And I thought we should come up with a better name.

247
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:27,480
 So there's some great walking words.

248
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:30,760
 Plutch, to flap the feet while walking like a seabird

249
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:32,200
 from Shetland.

250
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:35,320
 Prol, a short enjoyable walk that's from Kent.

251
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:37,560
 Proper stroll, I should think it stands for.

252
00:08:37,560 --> 00:08:41,720
 Shove, to saunter with extreme laziness from East Anglia.

253
00:08:41,720 --> 00:08:44,480
 To spandle, to leave wet footprints on the floor.

254
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:45,320
 Another Kentish stoner.

255
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:47,120
 - So do you think swine spandler?

256
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:49,120
 - I think it's exactly a hog-plutcher.

257
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:51,360
 - Hog-plutcher. (all laughing)

258
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:52,200
 - Now, what's this thing?

259
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:54,880
 Like, so later on after the medieval pig thing,

260
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:57,640
 urban pigs were a big deal.

261
00:08:57,640 --> 00:08:59,840
 Basically, in Manchester, everyone had their own pig.

262
00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:02,000
 And we know this partly 'cause of Friedrich Engels,

263
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,120
 who was writing about the conditions

264
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:08,680
 of the working class in England in the 1840s, 1845.

265
00:09:08,680 --> 00:09:10,560
 And he wrote that that was the case.

266
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:12,960
 And another writer was describing North Kensington.

267
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:15,280
 And in the mid-19th century, in North Kensington,

268
00:09:15,280 --> 00:09:17,920
 pigs outnumbered people three to one.

269
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:18,760
 - Really?

270
00:09:18,760 --> 00:09:20,080
 - Quite a lot.

271
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:22,600
 - There's more pigs in Spain now than humans.

272
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:23,760
 - Really? - Yeah.

273
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:26,600
 - Pigs in Spain.

274
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:30,760
 In the 1820s, there were more pigs in Manhattan

275
00:09:30,760 --> 00:09:33,440
 than there are cars in New York today.

276
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:34,880
 - Wow.

277
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:37,680
 - Well, you know the movie, "The Wolf of Wall Street"?

278
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:39,000
 - No, it was previously gonna be called

279
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,520
 "The Three Little Pigs of Wall Street."

280
00:09:40,520 --> 00:09:43,960
 - It should have been called that as a prequel.

281
00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:46,240
 The prequel would have been that, exactly that,

282
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:49,560
 because the wall of Wall Street initially was a wall, right?

283
00:09:49,560 --> 00:09:50,720
 This is when the Dutch were there.

284
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:51,560
 - Oh, I see.

285
00:09:51,560 --> 00:09:52,880
 - And they built, yeah, they built this wall.

286
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:56,600
 And this was during the 1600s, so 1653 to 1699.

287
00:09:56,600 --> 00:09:58,680
 As they were building the wall,

288
00:09:58,680 --> 00:10:01,200
 there was a picket fence that was there before.

289
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:02,040
 - A picket fence.

290
00:10:02,040 --> 00:10:03,080
 - A picket fence, yeah.

291
00:10:03,080 --> 00:10:04,800
 And it kept getting knocked down by pigs.

292
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:06,120
 So it was a huge problem.

293
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:08,240
 And they brought in municipal swine herds

294
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:09,640
 to try and curb it.

295
00:10:09,640 --> 00:10:10,960
 And that didn't happen.

296
00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:14,080
 So then they had to decree that you had to keep your pigs

297
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:18,400
 at home until the construction of Wall Street was built.

298
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:20,040
 - So the Dutch thing, New Amsterdam,

299
00:10:20,040 --> 00:10:23,040
 I happen to know that there's a Dutch word, Udvijn,

300
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:26,000
 which means to take a bracing walk in the wind.

301
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,360
 Isn't that a lovely thing to have a word for?

302
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:28,640
 - Oh, that's good, yeah.

303
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:31,360
 - And then the Dutch for pig is big.

304
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:32,200
 - Is it really big?

305
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:33,040
 - It's big, yeah.

306
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:33,920
 - That's correct.

307
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:35,000
 You're learning Dutch at the moment.

308
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,160
 - I am, yes.

309
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:40,520
 - What was the phrase you gave us just before the show started?

310
00:10:40,520 --> 00:10:44,760
 - (speaks in foreign language)

311
00:10:44,760 --> 00:10:46,120
 - Which translates as...

312
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:49,000
 - How do we know if the animals in the zoo are happy?

313
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,920
 - Great.

314
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:53,280
 - They're philosophical people.

315
00:10:53,280 --> 00:10:54,440
 - Do you know truffle pigs?

316
00:10:54,440 --> 00:10:55,640
 You've heard of truffle pigs, right?

317
00:10:55,640 --> 00:10:56,480
 - Yeah, yeah.

318
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:57,480
 - That hunt for truffles.

319
00:10:57,480 --> 00:10:59,040
 And in the Middle Ages,

320
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:01,040
 they didn't, they did hunt for truffles,

321
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:03,720
 but they ate them because nobody in the Middle Ages

322
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:04,560
 ate truffles.

323
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:05,380
 They thought that was weird.

324
00:11:05,380 --> 00:11:06,720
 - I agree.

325
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:11,720
 - Foxes, badges, wolves, wild boar, pigs and rats ate truffles.

326
00:11:11,720 --> 00:11:14,720
 And they only came back into favor in the Renaissance.

327
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:15,960
 So I got interested in truffles.

328
00:11:15,960 --> 00:11:17,720
 And Rossini, the composer,

329
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:19,960
 called the truffle the Mozart of fungi,

330
00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:21,240
 which is rather nice, isn't it?

331
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:22,080
 - Oh.

332
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:24,640
 - And he claimed to have only cried three times

333
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:26,760
 in his life, Rossini.

334
00:11:26,760 --> 00:11:29,120
 Once when his first opera was booed,

335
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:31,320
 once when he had Paganini play the violin,

336
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:33,200
 and once when he was picnic on a boat

337
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:35,080
 and the truffle turkey fell overboard.

338
00:11:35,080 --> 00:11:37,320
 (laughing)

339
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:39,900
 (upbeat music)

340
00:11:39,900 --> 00:11:43,720
 - Okay, it is time for fact number two.

341
00:11:43,720 --> 00:11:45,080
 And that is my fact.

342
00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:47,760
 My fact this week is that the comedian Bob Hope

343
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:51,040
 was so reliant on his writers to come up with jokes for him,

344
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:53,800
 he even had them provide bespoke one-liners

345
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:55,280
 for his social life.

346
00:11:55,280 --> 00:11:57,720
 So we all know Bob Hope.

347
00:11:57,720 --> 00:11:59,200
 - A lot of people don't these days.

348
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:00,040
 (laughing)

349
00:12:00,040 --> 00:12:01,480
 - Just in case, just in case.

350
00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:03,080
 - It fell on Stony Grandin.

351
00:12:03,080 --> 00:12:04,640
 Let's move on to the third fact.

352
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:07,400
 (laughing)

353
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:08,240
 - So Bob Hope.

354
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:09,560
 - So you said comedian.

355
00:12:09,560 --> 00:12:10,400
 - Yeah.

356
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:12,880
 - Bob Hope was possibly the biggest comedian in the world.

357
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:13,720
 - He was huge.

358
00:12:13,720 --> 00:12:14,540
 - He was huge.

359
00:12:14,540 --> 00:12:15,360
 He lived to 100 years old.

360
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:17,360
 He hosted the Oscars 19 times.

361
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:20,240
 He was a box office hit during the '40s.

362
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:22,640
 Number one movie at one point in the '40s

363
00:12:22,640 --> 00:12:24,480
 was a Bob Hope movie.

364
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:28,800
 He received its estimated 38,000 fan letters per week

365
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:30,080
 during the 1940s.

366
00:12:30,080 --> 00:12:31,920
 This is how loved he was.

367
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:35,400
 But he's the person who effectively created the idea

368
00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:37,500
 of the modern standup monologue

369
00:12:37,500 --> 00:12:39,920
 where he incorporated himself, the audience,

370
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:43,160
 the situation around him, the topical news of the day.

371
00:12:43,160 --> 00:12:45,920
 And he used to hire so many writers.

372
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:47,520
 He was the first person to acknowledge

373
00:12:47,520 --> 00:12:49,200
 he had writers as well, properly.

374
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:52,200
 He would mention, hold the cue cards up higher

375
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:53,920
 during his act, be quicker on that.

376
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:55,560
 You wouldn't say that if my writers were here.

377
00:12:55,560 --> 00:12:56,940
 Those kind of lines.

378
00:12:56,940 --> 00:13:00,760
 And yeah, and so, so much was he reliant on it that,

379
00:13:00,760 --> 00:13:03,440
 as I say, even if he was going on like a golf game

380
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:05,640
 and he knew that he had some powerful CEOs there

381
00:13:05,640 --> 00:13:06,920
 that he wanted to impress,

382
00:13:06,920 --> 00:13:08,280
 they would write these jokes for him

383
00:13:08,280 --> 00:13:09,960
 and he would memorize them and bust them out

384
00:13:09,960 --> 00:13:10,960
 as if they were ad libs.

385
00:13:10,960 --> 00:13:11,800
 - Great idea.

386
00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:12,640
 - Yeah.

387
00:13:12,640 --> 00:13:13,480
 - I'd love that.

388
00:13:13,480 --> 00:13:15,280
 - He'd gotten a lot of stick from other comedians.

389
00:13:15,280 --> 00:13:18,720
 The Lenny Bruce's and the growing world of comedians

390
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:21,240
 who were auteur and wrote their own material

391
00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:24,200
 'cause they saw him as an actor as opposed to a comedian.

392
00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:27,360
 But I'm a big fan of the way that he led his life.

393
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:29,280
 I think, and his comedy life particularly,

394
00:13:29,280 --> 00:13:31,840
 I think that he innovated so many things.

395
00:13:31,840 --> 00:13:33,480
 So if he was gonna play in a town,

396
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:36,200
 he would send his writers ahead, days ahead,

397
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:37,960
 and they would scope around the whole town.

398
00:13:37,960 --> 00:13:39,240
 They would look at the local shops.

399
00:13:39,240 --> 00:13:40,320
 They would meet the local people

400
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:42,880
 and they would base the material they wrote for him on that.

401
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:43,920
 - It would have been weird though,

402
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:46,680
 if he's doing a joke about the local hardware shop.

403
00:13:46,680 --> 00:13:47,840
 - No, I think that's...

404
00:13:47,840 --> 00:13:49,760
 - Well, do you remember like when we went on tour,

405
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:51,560
 we would do facts about the local town?

406
00:13:51,560 --> 00:13:52,920
 - Oh yeah, but that was good.

407
00:13:52,920 --> 00:13:53,760
 That was great.

408
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:56,960
 That was, you know, that was a very different...

409
00:13:56,960 --> 00:13:58,440
 - John, did you ever meet Bob Hope?

410
00:13:58,440 --> 00:13:59,800
 - No, but I spoke to him.

411
00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:00,840
 - Really? - Yeah.

412
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:01,680
 One Christmas Eve,

413
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:04,440
 I used to produce a live radio two-show

414
00:14:04,440 --> 00:14:06,320
 called Late Night Extra when I was very, very young,

415
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:10,000
 sort of 24 or something like that, 23 even.

416
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:13,920
 And I was producing one on Christmas Eve

417
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:16,280
 and I had the best address book in the world probably.

418
00:14:16,280 --> 00:14:17,600
 It was amazing.

419
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:18,440
 Everybody's singing.

420
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:19,960
 For some reason, I had Bob Hope's phone number,

421
00:14:19,960 --> 00:14:23,000
 so I phoned him up in California on Christmas Eve

422
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,040
 and said, "Hey, Bob, how's it going?"

423
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:26,920
 He goes, "Who is this? Who is this?"

424
00:14:26,920 --> 00:14:28,600
 I said, "It's the BBC in London, Mr. Hope."

425
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:32,000
 He goes, "Oh, hi there. Hi, guy, how are you?"

426
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,280
 He was great.

427
00:14:34,280 --> 00:14:35,120
 - Have you still got the number?

428
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:35,960
 Let's call it now.

429
00:14:35,960 --> 00:14:37,800
 (laughing)

430
00:14:37,800 --> 00:14:38,920
 - He picks up.

431
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:41,320
 - But he was interesting that his attitude to write,

432
00:14:41,320 --> 00:14:42,720
 he paid them very well.

433
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:44,160
 He didn't acknowledge them,

434
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:46,600
 but he didn't think the writing was the big deal.

435
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:49,200
 He said creating the character was the thing

436
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:51,720
 and the lines were just something that the character said.

437
00:14:51,720 --> 00:14:54,560
 - Yeah, weirdly, a lot of people in recent biographies

438
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:56,720
 say that he was terrible at paying his writers.

439
00:14:56,720 --> 00:14:59,920
 That was sort of an idea that he was really good.

440
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:02,160
 Jack Benny would pay two writers the same amount.

441
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:04,680
 Jack Benny being another giant comedian of the day,

442
00:15:04,680 --> 00:15:07,440
 the same amount that Bob would pay 20 writers.

443
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:08,720
 What he'd do is he'd find the young writers.

444
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:10,680
 - Didn't you say that Jack Benny hated him

445
00:15:10,680 --> 00:15:11,840
 'cause he had writers?

446
00:15:11,840 --> 00:15:12,840
 - Not Jack Benny, no.

447
00:15:12,840 --> 00:15:14,840
 - Oh, I thought you said people like Jack Benny.

448
00:15:14,840 --> 00:15:15,680
 - Lenny Bruce.

449
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:16,800
 - Lenny Bruce.

450
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:20,160
 Jack Benny and Lenny Bruce are both double first-namers.

451
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:22,720
 Yeah, like Craig David or David Cameron.

452
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:23,560
 Anyway.

453
00:15:23,560 --> 00:15:25,520
 - Do you know who Bob Hope's most famous writer

454
00:15:25,520 --> 00:15:26,920
 was the least the one I'd heard of?

455
00:15:26,920 --> 00:15:27,840
 - No.

456
00:15:27,840 --> 00:15:29,040
 - Larry Gelbart.

457
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:29,880
 - Oh yeah, who's that?

458
00:15:29,880 --> 00:15:30,760
 - When he was very young.

459
00:15:30,760 --> 00:15:32,160
 He was the guy who wrote "Mash."

460
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:33,080
 - Oh wow, okay.

461
00:15:33,080 --> 00:15:35,920
 - And Bob Hope, one of the things he used to do was tour.

462
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:38,040
 He was basically, not only as you say it, Dan,

463
00:15:38,040 --> 00:15:39,800
 but he sort of invent stand-up comedy,

464
00:15:39,800 --> 00:15:43,560
 but the touring American forces in the '40s and '50s

465
00:15:43,560 --> 00:15:44,840
 was also a thing that was really,

466
00:15:44,840 --> 00:15:47,000
 nobody had ever thought of doing that before.

467
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:50,480
 And he did a lot and Larry Gelbart worked for him

468
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:53,640
 as a very young man and he was inspired by a tour

469
00:15:53,640 --> 00:15:56,480
 of the Far East to write "Mash."

470
00:15:56,480 --> 00:15:58,880
 - Yeah, Bob Hope famously used to do a Christmas show

471
00:15:58,880 --> 00:16:00,720
 that he would do from the front lines

472
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:03,080
 of wherever a war might be going and after a war

473
00:16:03,080 --> 00:16:05,240
 while people were still stationed out there.

474
00:16:05,240 --> 00:16:07,680
 So most comedians and acts would go out

475
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:10,080
 while it was wartime and he kind of continued on.

476
00:16:10,080 --> 00:16:11,240
 So he died age 100.

477
00:16:11,240 --> 00:16:14,600
 He did 48 Christmases out on the road.

478
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:16,360
 So 48 of his Christmases were spent

479
00:16:16,360 --> 00:16:17,960
 in a different country performing to troops.

480
00:16:17,960 --> 00:16:19,520
 - And one of them speaking to John Lloyd.

481
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:20,720
 - And one of them speaking to Lloyd.

482
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:23,960
 - Yeah, in a way, like being in a war zone, you know.

483
00:16:23,960 --> 00:16:26,320
 - But you're, sorry.

484
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:28,440
 - "Hope You Christmas" should have been the name of the show.

485
00:16:28,440 --> 00:16:30,080
 - "Hope You Christmas" doesn't get ever was.

486
00:16:30,080 --> 00:16:32,000
 - God, he had 48 goes to get that and you didn't.

487
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:32,840
 - Never got that.

488
00:16:32,840 --> 00:16:34,160
 - Never got that, exactly.

489
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:36,040
 - Hope is a first name, by the way.

490
00:16:36,040 --> 00:16:36,880
 - Is it?

491
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:38,080
 - Yeah, it's a woman's name.

492
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:40,040
 - Bob Hope joins the ranks of...

493
00:16:40,040 --> 00:16:42,400
 (laughing)

494
00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:45,080
 - But I was reading that about the wartime thing.

495
00:16:45,080 --> 00:16:45,920
 - Sorry, sorry, sorry.

496
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:48,080
 - Jerry Lewis, two first names.

497
00:16:48,080 --> 00:16:48,920
 - Jerry Lewis, yeah.

498
00:16:48,920 --> 00:16:50,320
 - Dean Marden, two first names.

499
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:51,320
 - Yeah.

500
00:16:51,320 --> 00:16:52,640
 - Did they all have first names?

501
00:16:52,640 --> 00:16:53,840
 - That's extraordinary.

502
00:16:53,840 --> 00:16:55,360
 - Frank Sinatra, no.

503
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:56,200
 - But he's not a comedian.

504
00:16:56,200 --> 00:16:57,920
 - Great point, all right, on we go.

505
00:16:57,920 --> 00:16:59,160
 - The thing about his war shows.

506
00:16:59,160 --> 00:17:00,000
 - Andy Murray.

507
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:00,840
 - Oh, that's good.

508
00:17:00,840 --> 00:17:01,680
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

509
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:02,520
 - So it's not always comedians.

510
00:17:02,520 --> 00:17:03,360
 - John Lloyd.

511
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:04,200
 (laughing)

512
00:17:04,200 --> 00:17:06,360
 - Yeah, fair enough, John Lloyd, yeah.

513
00:17:06,360 --> 00:17:08,120
 - I think John Lloyd and Andy Murray

514
00:17:08,120 --> 00:17:10,080
 are in those weird category of like Lloyd and Murray

515
00:17:10,080 --> 00:17:12,160
 are kind of first names and kind of surname.

516
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:13,000
 You know, they can be both.

517
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:13,840
 - Yeah.

518
00:17:13,840 --> 00:17:16,200
 - It's not the pure simplicity of it, Greg David.

519
00:17:16,200 --> 00:17:17,040
 - Agreed.

520
00:17:17,040 --> 00:17:17,880
 - Okay.

521
00:17:17,880 --> 00:17:20,160
 Did you have something come on?

522
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:21,000
 - I did, I did.

523
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:21,840
 - Well, no, I was just gonna say

524
00:17:21,840 --> 00:17:24,560
 what was particularly touching about the war shows

525
00:17:24,560 --> 00:17:28,360
 is that for a lot of parents, brothers and sisters,

526
00:17:28,360 --> 00:17:29,640
 whatever, friends at home,

527
00:17:29,640 --> 00:17:32,640
 this was the only time that they were able to see

528
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:34,880
 possibly one of their family members

529
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:37,800
 who was off at war on camera during Christmas time.

530
00:17:37,800 --> 00:17:40,600
 So a lot of the 38,000 letters that came to Bob Hope

531
00:17:40,600 --> 00:17:43,480
 was from people saying I got to see my boy

532
00:17:43,480 --> 00:17:45,920
 sitting there in the crowd laughing at your jokes

533
00:17:45,920 --> 00:17:47,040
 and he didn't make it.

534
00:17:47,040 --> 00:17:48,720
 He lost his life to the war.

535
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:50,600
 Thank you for giving me that moment

536
00:17:50,600 --> 00:17:51,680
 where I could connect with him.

537
00:17:51,680 --> 00:17:53,680
 So they were really important shows

538
00:17:53,680 --> 00:17:55,520
 to America at the time.

539
00:17:55,520 --> 00:17:57,600
 - His last military gig was in 1990

540
00:17:57,600 --> 00:18:00,040
 when he went to the Gulf at the age of--

541
00:18:00,040 --> 00:18:00,880
 - '87.

542
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:01,800
 - '87, yeah.

543
00:18:01,800 --> 00:18:05,040
 And lots of the troops in the crowd for his final gig,

544
00:18:05,040 --> 00:18:07,080
 they had fathers who had seen him in Vietnam

545
00:18:07,080 --> 00:18:10,520
 and some of them had grandfathers who had seen Bob Hope

546
00:18:10,520 --> 00:18:12,480
 in the second world war performing.

547
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:13,960
 It's mad, the idea that you go to a gig

548
00:18:13,960 --> 00:18:15,600
 and your grandfather saw the same comedian.

549
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:18,160
 - Yeah, I mean, lucky that you managed to get two generations

550
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:19,640
 that they didn't die in the past.

551
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:22,360
 - Yeah, that's true, yeah, that's true, yeah.

552
00:18:22,360 --> 00:18:23,240
 While reading about this,

553
00:18:23,240 --> 00:18:26,920
 I found my favorite new human.

554
00:18:26,920 --> 00:18:29,000
 Yeah, just like, it's an exciting character.

555
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,640
 So this is to do with the writers and so on.

556
00:18:31,640 --> 00:18:34,000
 It's a guy called Barney McNulty.

557
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,240
 Bob Hope used to bring him everywhere with him.

558
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:37,400
 What do you think he did?

559
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:39,280
 He was part of that team.

560
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:40,120
 - So not a writer?

561
00:18:40,120 --> 00:18:40,960
 - Was he a boxer?

562
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:43,160
 'Cause Bob Hope was a boxer before he was a comedian.

563
00:18:43,160 --> 00:18:44,400
 - He was, but no, he wasn't a boxer.

564
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:47,000
 - Did he point out whenever he met anyone

565
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:48,520
 who had two first names?

566
00:18:48,520 --> 00:18:49,720
 (laughing)

567
00:18:49,720 --> 00:18:50,560
 - No, this is--

568
00:18:50,560 --> 00:18:51,600
 - I could do with one of those guys, James.

569
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:52,440
 - Yeah.

570
00:18:52,440 --> 00:18:53,280
 - I'd love that, yeah, yeah.

571
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:54,680
 - I feel like you could be one of those guys, Andy.

572
00:18:54,680 --> 00:18:56,000
 - Oh, I dream, you know.

573
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,000
 (laughing)

574
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:01,200
 - What's, somewhat like a, just a personal, you know,

575
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:03,240
 assistant, like a backburn or a--

576
00:19:03,240 --> 00:19:06,920
 - So what Barney McNulty was, was the Q-Card guy.

577
00:19:06,920 --> 00:19:08,760
 And everything was written on Q-Cards.

578
00:19:08,760 --> 00:19:11,240
 And Barney McNulty is acknowledged

579
00:19:11,240 --> 00:19:13,640
 with having invented Q-Cards, basically.

580
00:19:13,640 --> 00:19:17,640
 No one ever delivered monologues on TV before with Q-Cards.

581
00:19:17,640 --> 00:19:19,520
 And Barney McNulty was the guy to do this.

582
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:21,800
 He said doing it was like, it was like a,

583
00:19:21,800 --> 00:19:23,400
 like handling snakes.

584
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:25,440
 You had to work with the rhythm of the comedian.

585
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:27,120
 You had to have the font big enough

586
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:27,960
 and you're writing and so on.

587
00:19:27,960 --> 00:19:28,800
 - Like a snake.

588
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:29,640
 - Yeah.

589
00:19:29,640 --> 00:19:30,480
 (laughing)

590
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:32,320
 'Cause he said the comedians are wriggling around.

591
00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:34,120
 They're, they're improvising, they're changing.

592
00:19:34,120 --> 00:19:35,240
 You don't know where they're gonna go.

593
00:19:35,240 --> 00:19:36,080
 It's kind of--

594
00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:36,920
 - Like an auto-Q person.

595
00:19:36,920 --> 00:19:38,320
 - Yeah, like a modern day auto-Q person.

596
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:40,320
 - So sometimes the auto-Q can be done too fast

597
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:42,360
 or too slow and the presenter gets in a tangle

598
00:19:42,360 --> 00:19:43,200
 and then--

599
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:44,040
 - Yeah, yeah.

600
00:19:44,040 --> 00:19:44,860
 - Yeah, auto-Qs are boring then.

601
00:19:44,860 --> 00:19:45,700
 It should be called a McNulty, shouldn't it?

602
00:19:45,700 --> 00:19:46,540
 - Yes.

603
00:19:46,540 --> 00:19:47,380
 - The McNulty, yeah.

604
00:19:47,380 --> 00:19:49,000
 So McNulty was so important to him.

605
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:50,920
 Steve Allen, who's another comedian of the time,

606
00:19:50,920 --> 00:19:52,360
 said that he was once at a barbecue.

607
00:19:52,360 --> 00:19:53,200
 - Steve Allen.

608
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:54,440
 - Yep, Steve Allen.

609
00:19:54,440 --> 00:19:55,280
 - Oh, yeah!

610
00:19:55,280 --> 00:19:56,120
 (laughing)

611
00:19:56,120 --> 00:19:57,720
 - Oh, this is, you've uncovered a scene.

612
00:19:57,720 --> 00:20:00,480
 (laughing)

613
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:02,360
 Once, the problem is once you start seeing them,

614
00:20:02,360 --> 00:20:03,200
 you can't stop.

615
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:04,040
 - Yeah.

616
00:20:04,040 --> 00:20:04,880
 - Yeah.

617
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:05,720
 I've been this way for years.

618
00:20:05,720 --> 00:20:06,560
 (laughing)

619
00:20:06,560 --> 00:20:09,600
 So he was at a party at Barbecue with Bob Hope

620
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:12,640
 and Bob came out and suddenly just did an improvised speech

621
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:14,720
 to all the people, it's nighttime.

622
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:15,760
 He's, "Yeah, thank you for coming."

623
00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:17,160
 And he's doing all these jokes.

624
00:20:17,160 --> 00:20:18,960
 And Steve said, he's hearing these jokes

625
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:20,840
 and he's thinking, "This is a pretty worked out monologue,

626
00:20:20,840 --> 00:20:22,440
 but it's pretty topical."

627
00:20:22,440 --> 00:20:24,640
 Turns around, he says, "He notices sitting in the bushes

628
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:26,280
 with a flashlight and some cue cards,

629
00:20:26,280 --> 00:20:31,240
 is McNulty hiding away, giving him the cue cards to do it."

630
00:20:31,240 --> 00:20:33,880
 - So I haven't really said very much in this part

631
00:20:33,880 --> 00:20:36,320
 because I don't really know anything about comedy,

632
00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:38,040
 but I do know a lot about golf.

633
00:20:38,040 --> 00:20:39,960
 (laughing)

634
00:20:39,960 --> 00:20:41,800
 And Bob Hope used to love golf.

635
00:20:41,800 --> 00:20:44,000
 And that's really kind of all I knew about him

636
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:45,480
 is that he was a golfer.

637
00:20:45,480 --> 00:20:49,760
 I read that, you know, Alan Shepard, the astronaut,

638
00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:52,200
 yeah, he hit a golf ball on the moon.

639
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:54,440
 And according to Bob Hope, it was his idea.

640
00:20:54,440 --> 00:20:55,280
 - No.

641
00:20:55,280 --> 00:20:59,160
 - Yeah, he said that he was once speaking to Alan Shepard

642
00:20:59,160 --> 00:21:01,800
 and he used to kind of always carry his golf clubs around him,

643
00:21:01,800 --> 00:21:02,840
 kind of just to--

644
00:21:02,840 --> 00:21:03,800
 - That was his thing, he would--

645
00:21:03,800 --> 00:21:06,200
 - Yeah, and he reckoned that Alan Shepard

646
00:21:06,200 --> 00:21:08,520
 got the inspiration by watching him

647
00:21:08,520 --> 00:21:10,200
 swing in his golf club.

648
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:12,840
 He was on the Mike Douglas show

649
00:21:12,840 --> 00:21:15,640
 when Tiger Woods first appeared on television

650
00:21:15,640 --> 00:21:17,280
 when he was two years old.

651
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:19,320
 So Tiger Woods was a little dot

652
00:21:19,320 --> 00:21:20,800
 and he was kind of hitting golf balls

653
00:21:20,800 --> 00:21:22,080
 and everyone was like, look how amazing

654
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:24,280
 this little kid is at playing golf.

655
00:21:24,280 --> 00:21:27,520
 And Bob Hope was on the show when that happened.

656
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:29,680
 So he's there for the start of Tiger Woods.

657
00:21:29,680 --> 00:21:33,200
 And apparently on his first date, he was so nervous,

658
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:37,080
 he would just sit and draw golf holes on the tablecloth.

659
00:21:37,080 --> 00:21:40,880
 And he did it so much that they made him pay for the tablecloth

660
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:42,920
 because he'd draw all these golf holes on it.

661
00:21:42,920 --> 00:21:43,960
 - Oh, that's so great.

662
00:21:43,960 --> 00:21:46,000
 - I certainly claim they were golf holes later on.

663
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:47,720
 (all laughing)

664
00:21:47,720 --> 00:21:49,600
 - These, oh, they're--

665
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:50,800
 - And Alan Shepard with, of course,

666
00:21:50,800 --> 00:21:52,600
 a job in the Middle Ages.

667
00:21:52,600 --> 00:21:56,280
 (all laughing)

668
00:21:56,280 --> 00:21:58,360
 - I thought that was your job on QI, John.

669
00:21:58,360 --> 00:21:59,360
 (all laughing)

670
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:01,940
 (upbeat music)

671
00:22:02,380 --> 00:22:04,660
 (upbeat music)

672
00:22:04,660 --> 00:22:07,060
 - Okay, it is time for fact number three,

673
00:22:07,060 --> 00:22:08,860
 and that is James.

674
00:22:08,860 --> 00:22:13,420
 - Okay, my fact this week is that the unarmed stick insect

675
00:22:13,420 --> 00:22:15,660
 has an infinite number of arms.

676
00:22:15,660 --> 00:22:19,740
 (all laughing)

677
00:22:19,740 --> 00:22:21,980
 - Um, okay.

678
00:22:21,980 --> 00:22:22,820
 - So what?

679
00:22:22,820 --> 00:22:24,420
 - I'm not saying anything else, that's it.

680
00:22:24,420 --> 00:22:25,260
 - Why is it, that's it?

681
00:22:25,260 --> 00:22:26,260
 Does it play golf?

682
00:22:26,260 --> 00:22:28,060
 (all laughing)

683
00:22:28,060 --> 00:22:29,140
 Infinite is a big word.

684
00:22:29,140 --> 00:22:29,980
 - Yeah, that's a big word, I was gonna say that.

685
00:22:29,980 --> 00:22:31,300
 - It's a long word, yeah.

686
00:22:31,300 --> 00:22:32,820
 - It's a full eight letters.

687
00:22:32,820 --> 00:22:33,660
 - Don't you mean that?

688
00:22:33,660 --> 00:22:34,940
 (all laughing)

689
00:22:34,940 --> 00:22:37,780
 - It's, no, the thing is, I would say,

690
00:22:37,780 --> 00:22:39,700
 sticking sets can regrow their limbs.

691
00:22:39,700 --> 00:22:40,700
 - Yeah, right? - Theoretically.

692
00:22:40,700 --> 00:22:41,540
 - Theoretically.

693
00:22:41,540 --> 00:22:44,740
 - Theoretically, possibly forever.

694
00:22:44,740 --> 00:22:46,540
 You know, if you keep chopping them off,

695
00:22:46,540 --> 00:22:47,380
 they'll keep growing them.

696
00:22:47,380 --> 00:22:49,340
 - Yeah, the main body doesn't live forever,

697
00:22:49,340 --> 00:22:50,180
 does it, or does it?

698
00:22:50,180 --> 00:22:51,220
 - No, no, no.

699
00:22:51,220 --> 00:22:53,980
 I think probably we would reach a time limit.

700
00:22:53,980 --> 00:22:54,820
 The other thing--

701
00:22:54,820 --> 00:22:55,660
 - Like about a week?

702
00:22:55,660 --> 00:22:56,820
 - Well, 'cause they would die,

703
00:22:56,820 --> 00:22:58,460
 but the other problem is they can only do it

704
00:22:58,460 --> 00:22:59,300
 when they're young.

705
00:22:59,300 --> 00:23:00,140
 - Okay.

706
00:23:00,140 --> 00:23:02,740
 - But they could keep doing it and doing it and doing it

707
00:23:02,740 --> 00:23:04,500
 if you kept chopping off all the limbs.

708
00:23:04,500 --> 00:23:06,900
 - Yeah, hell of a shock to your juvenile stick insect.

709
00:23:06,900 --> 00:23:08,940
 The first time it chops an arm off

710
00:23:08,940 --> 00:23:11,580
 and it doesn't grow back, it thinks, oh no,

711
00:23:11,580 --> 00:23:13,540
 now I'm officially no longer a juvenile.

712
00:23:13,540 --> 00:23:14,380
 - Yeah, it must be.

713
00:23:14,380 --> 00:23:15,340
 - 'Cause you must get used to operating

714
00:23:15,340 --> 00:23:16,180
 with complete impunity.

715
00:23:16,180 --> 00:23:18,220
 - It's a real coming of age moment, isn't it?

716
00:23:18,220 --> 00:23:19,940
 - Yes, yeah.

717
00:23:19,940 --> 00:23:22,780
 - So they can keep regrowing their arms.

718
00:23:22,780 --> 00:23:25,500
 Another question is, do they have arms or are they legs?

719
00:23:25,500 --> 00:23:26,840
 (all laughing)

720
00:23:26,840 --> 00:23:27,680
 - It's called unarmed.

721
00:23:27,680 --> 00:23:29,300
 Is there a reason why it's called unarmed?

722
00:23:29,300 --> 00:23:31,460
 - Yeah, because it doesn't have defenses.

723
00:23:31,460 --> 00:23:33,580
 - Yes, it's armed as in weapons.

724
00:23:33,580 --> 00:23:35,940
 - Yeah, to be honest, it's just a silly thing

725
00:23:35,940 --> 00:23:37,560
 'cause I noticed it was called unarmed

726
00:23:37,560 --> 00:23:40,140
 and I remembered they could keep regrowing their arms.

727
00:23:40,140 --> 00:23:40,980
 - Yeah, that's so great.

728
00:23:40,980 --> 00:23:42,860
 - But I just thought let's talk about stick insects

729
00:23:42,860 --> 00:23:44,540
 'cause stick insects are awesome.

730
00:23:44,540 --> 00:23:47,060
 These ones, these unarmed stick insects

731
00:23:47,060 --> 00:23:50,500
 are the most common stick insects found in Britain.

732
00:23:50,500 --> 00:23:51,340
 - Are they?

733
00:23:51,340 --> 00:23:52,540
 - Oh, yes they are.

734
00:23:52,540 --> 00:23:56,780
 Because we have no native stick insects in this country,

735
00:23:56,780 --> 00:23:59,980
 but one of them accidentally got brought in some timber

736
00:23:59,980 --> 00:24:02,020
 from New Zealand in the 20s.

737
00:24:02,020 --> 00:24:02,860
 - Right.

738
00:24:02,860 --> 00:24:05,100
 - And they reproduce pathogenically

739
00:24:05,100 --> 00:24:07,780
 so they don't need more than one of them

740
00:24:07,780 --> 00:24:09,740
 to create more and more and more of them.

741
00:24:09,740 --> 00:24:12,460
 - It's really pleasing that it came over in some timber

742
00:24:12,460 --> 00:24:15,820
 disguised as a smaller stick in a load of larger sticks.

743
00:24:15,820 --> 00:24:16,660
 That's brilliant.

744
00:24:16,660 --> 00:24:18,220
 - There was probably a guy at the park

745
00:24:18,220 --> 00:24:19,860
 just counting all of these sticks

746
00:24:19,860 --> 00:24:21,940
 and go, we've got one too many.

747
00:24:21,940 --> 00:24:23,820
 (all laughing)

748
00:24:23,820 --> 00:24:26,980
 So these were discovered in New Zealand in 1955

749
00:24:26,980 --> 00:24:30,140
 by a man who also, like this misnamed animal,

750
00:24:30,140 --> 00:24:32,620
 is called John Salmon, not a fish.

751
00:24:32,620 --> 00:24:33,460
 - That's amazing.

752
00:24:33,460 --> 00:24:36,260
 - But he is responsible for discovering,

753
00:24:36,260 --> 00:24:39,700
 so there's a Wikipedia list of stick insects of New Zealand

754
00:24:39,700 --> 00:24:41,260
 of which there are 23.

755
00:24:41,260 --> 00:24:44,900
 John Salmon discovered nine of the stick insects of New Zealand.

756
00:24:44,900 --> 00:24:45,740
 - Oh yeah.

757
00:24:45,740 --> 00:24:48,220
 - You do find the same people come up again and again

758
00:24:48,220 --> 00:24:49,740
 when you look at all the different species

759
00:24:49,740 --> 00:24:51,980
 of stick insects, tends to be the same.

760
00:24:51,980 --> 00:24:55,220
 - It's almost if no one else is looking for stick insects,

761
00:24:55,220 --> 00:24:56,060
 right?

762
00:24:56,060 --> 00:24:56,900
 Or maybe they're specialized

763
00:24:56,900 --> 00:24:57,900
 'cause they're quite hard to see.

764
00:24:57,900 --> 00:24:58,820
 - They're so hard.

765
00:24:58,820 --> 00:25:01,300
 So I was reading about leaf insects,

766
00:25:01,300 --> 00:25:03,100
 which are similar, you know, they look,

767
00:25:03,100 --> 00:25:05,580
 and they are unbelievably realistic leaf insects.

768
00:25:05,580 --> 00:25:07,740
 As in they attach to a tree where they look exactly

769
00:25:07,740 --> 00:25:10,260
 like that leaf, and they have little bit and out edges.

770
00:25:10,260 --> 00:25:11,660
 So it looks like an insect.

771
00:25:11,660 --> 00:25:12,980
 - So amazing.

772
00:25:12,980 --> 00:25:16,860
 - But lots of experts on leaf and stick insects

773
00:25:16,860 --> 00:25:19,420
 have never seen them in the wild.

774
00:25:19,420 --> 00:25:20,380
 It's quite tragic really.

775
00:25:20,380 --> 00:25:21,820
 So there's a guy called Royce Cumming,

776
00:25:21,820 --> 00:25:23,620
 who's a world expert on leaf insects.

777
00:25:23,620 --> 00:25:25,300
 He's never seen one in the wild.

778
00:25:25,300 --> 00:25:27,140
 - That's amazing.

779
00:25:27,140 --> 00:25:28,700
 - Because what, you know, it's really hard for me.

780
00:25:28,700 --> 00:25:30,740
 - 'Cause you can't just check every leaf.

781
00:25:30,740 --> 00:25:32,900
 - Exactly, that's the problem.

782
00:25:32,900 --> 00:25:33,820
 That's exactly it.

783
00:25:33,820 --> 00:25:35,060
 - Yeah, it's a nightmare.

784
00:25:35,060 --> 00:25:35,900
 If you wanna get a new cell.

785
00:25:35,900 --> 00:25:37,620
 - Stupid, they should have gone for like.

786
00:25:37,620 --> 00:25:38,460
 - Yeah, elephants.

787
00:25:38,460 --> 00:25:39,940
 - Elephants, absolutely.

788
00:25:39,940 --> 00:25:42,460
 - Stick insects feature in Maori myth.

789
00:25:42,460 --> 00:25:44,140
 - Yes, right.

790
00:25:44,140 --> 00:25:44,980
 - Quite a few times.

791
00:25:44,980 --> 00:25:47,380
 And just something I just happened to know

792
00:25:47,380 --> 00:25:49,820
 about Maori, the language,

793
00:25:49,820 --> 00:25:53,020
 which is the Maori for nuclear warfare,

794
00:25:53,020 --> 00:25:54,660
 is umu pongi pongi.

795
00:25:54,660 --> 00:25:56,340
 - Right.

796
00:25:56,340 --> 00:25:57,660
 - You didn't think they would have a word for it,

797
00:25:57,660 --> 00:25:58,500
 but they do.

798
00:25:58,500 --> 00:26:00,660
 - Your duolingo is very bold.

799
00:26:00,660 --> 00:26:01,820
 You're like a far ranger.

800
00:26:01,820 --> 00:26:03,060
 - This is a dictionary.

801
00:26:03,060 --> 00:26:05,180
 This is not duolingo.

802
00:26:05,180 --> 00:26:06,820
 - Other language apps are available.

803
00:26:06,820 --> 00:26:08,260
 Memorise, et cetera.

804
00:26:08,260 --> 00:26:11,940
 - When stick insects feel under threat.

805
00:26:11,940 --> 00:26:12,780
 - Oh yeah.

806
00:26:12,780 --> 00:26:14,100
 - They will play dead.

807
00:26:14,100 --> 00:26:18,420
 Or be more like a stick than usual, basically.

808
00:26:18,420 --> 00:26:21,620
 And I found an insect owning website

809
00:26:21,620 --> 00:26:23,020
 which had a problem page.

810
00:26:23,020 --> 00:26:24,420
 And the problem was,

811
00:26:24,420 --> 00:26:27,540
 is my stick insect playing dead or has it died?

812
00:26:27,540 --> 00:26:31,140
 - Or is it in fact a twig?

813
00:26:31,140 --> 00:26:34,500
 - We used to have stick insects when I was a kid.

814
00:26:34,500 --> 00:26:35,620
 Pet and stick insects.

815
00:26:35,620 --> 00:26:36,460
 Yeah, yeah.

816
00:26:36,460 --> 00:26:38,800
 And it is, I mean, they did die,

817
00:26:38,800 --> 00:26:41,020
 I'm sorry to say, quite regularly.

818
00:26:41,020 --> 00:26:42,300
 They didn't live very long.

819
00:26:42,300 --> 00:26:44,900
 I hope that wasn't due to our bad husbandry, but.

820
00:26:44,900 --> 00:26:46,740
 - Or did they die very frequently?

821
00:26:46,740 --> 00:26:48,620
 - Maybe they were just trying to get themselves thrown out.

822
00:26:48,620 --> 00:26:51,020
 - We usually check, I don't know what your FAQs will say,

823
00:26:51,020 --> 00:26:53,500
 but for us it was usually when there weren't many poos

824
00:26:53,500 --> 00:26:55,500
 for a few days, that was a problem.

825
00:26:55,500 --> 00:26:57,300
 - What's a poo look like from a stick insect?

826
00:26:57,300 --> 00:26:58,860
 - It's just like a black dot.

827
00:26:58,860 --> 00:26:59,700
 - Right, nice.

828
00:26:59,700 --> 00:27:00,700
 - Yeah.

829
00:27:00,700 --> 00:27:03,100
 - Well, this is basically, if they're threatened,

830
00:27:03,100 --> 00:27:05,180
 they fold their legs up and they paralyze themselves

831
00:27:05,180 --> 00:27:07,780
 and they often fall off the branch to the foliage.

832
00:27:07,780 --> 00:27:09,940
 But that happens if they get surprised,

833
00:27:09,940 --> 00:27:11,660
 if they face any surprise until they're played dead.

834
00:27:11,660 --> 00:27:14,740
 So you either wait to see if the color has changed,

835
00:27:14,740 --> 00:27:17,100
 'cause that is a sign that they can't do that by themselves.

836
00:27:17,100 --> 00:27:20,340
 - Can the leaf insects change color in the autumn?

837
00:27:20,340 --> 00:27:21,780
 - I don't think so.

838
00:27:21,780 --> 00:27:23,300
 - Okay.

839
00:27:23,300 --> 00:27:24,380
 - And the other thing you can do,

840
00:27:24,380 --> 00:27:25,380
 there's just a bit of advice,

841
00:27:25,380 --> 00:27:28,460
 is to stimulate the insect's mouth palps,

842
00:27:28,460 --> 00:27:30,300
 which are these small organs near the mouth,

843
00:27:30,300 --> 00:27:32,300
 which are incredibly sensitive.

844
00:27:32,300 --> 00:27:33,320
 And if you stimulate those,

845
00:27:33,320 --> 00:27:36,620
 it will make a sudden movement, 'cause it hates that.

846
00:27:36,620 --> 00:27:38,140
 And if not, it has died.

847
00:27:38,140 --> 00:27:42,420
 I'm slightly moved by all these pets and things dying

848
00:27:42,420 --> 00:27:46,140
 because my dad was in the Navy, we never had pets.

849
00:27:46,140 --> 00:27:47,460
 So when the kids were small,

850
00:27:47,460 --> 00:27:50,700
 we won a goldfish at a fair in Chipping Norton,

851
00:27:50,700 --> 00:27:52,780
 who was called Chippy, the fish.

852
00:27:52,780 --> 00:27:54,100
 I love this little fish

853
00:27:54,100 --> 00:27:57,380
 and it got something wrong with it, swim bladder.

854
00:27:57,380 --> 00:27:58,820
 And I was really heartbroken.

855
00:27:58,820 --> 00:28:01,180
 I was very sort of, you know, anxious about it.

856
00:28:01,180 --> 00:28:05,020
 And so I used to take it to the local vet

857
00:28:05,020 --> 00:28:07,460
 in a bucket in Hammersmith.

858
00:28:07,460 --> 00:28:10,940
 And so I was sitting there in a bucket,

859
00:28:10,940 --> 00:28:14,260
 this little goldfish in a tiny little thing, fair goldfish.

860
00:28:14,260 --> 00:28:15,100
 - Was it on a lead?

861
00:28:15,100 --> 00:28:15,940
 No.

862
00:28:15,940 --> 00:28:17,540
 (all laughing)

863
00:28:17,540 --> 00:28:19,860
 - And all these people would be there with salukis

864
00:28:19,860 --> 00:28:23,180
 and parakeets and horses and things like that.

865
00:28:23,180 --> 00:28:25,780
 And the vet's assistant would come out and say,

866
00:28:25,780 --> 00:28:30,220
 "Mrs. Campbell Rouse and Montmorency, the third?"

867
00:28:30,220 --> 00:28:31,220
 (all laughing)

868
00:28:31,220 --> 00:28:33,940
 And so he would get up with an antelope or something.

869
00:28:33,940 --> 00:28:34,940
 (all laughing)

870
00:28:34,940 --> 00:28:38,060
 They came to me and she'd go, "Mr. Lloyd and fish?"

871
00:28:38,060 --> 00:28:39,980
 (all laughing)

872
00:28:39,980 --> 00:28:41,420
 And after about four visits,

873
00:28:41,420 --> 00:28:44,220
 and what he used to do the vet was inject this goldfish

874
00:28:44,220 --> 00:28:45,420
 with something wrong with the swim bladder,

875
00:28:45,420 --> 00:28:47,220
 with the tiniest little hypotermics

876
00:28:47,220 --> 00:28:50,340
 that you've ever seen, about two inches long.

877
00:28:50,340 --> 00:28:51,980
 And after the fourth time he said,

878
00:28:51,980 --> 00:28:55,140
 "Mr. Lloyd, I'm afraid there's nothing more I can do for fish.

879
00:28:55,140 --> 00:28:56,540
 He's going to take his chances."

880
00:28:56,540 --> 00:28:59,620
 - Oh, 'cause that is a problem with goldfish, isn't it?

881
00:28:59,620 --> 00:29:02,020
 They get these swim bladder problems

882
00:29:02,020 --> 00:29:03,660
 and they'll kind of float to the surface

883
00:29:03,660 --> 00:29:05,460
 and sometimes they go upside down.

884
00:29:05,460 --> 00:29:07,180
 And people think that they're dead,

885
00:29:07,180 --> 00:29:08,380
 but actually they're not dead.

886
00:29:08,380 --> 00:29:11,380
 They can be, they can have their swim bladder pricked

887
00:29:11,380 --> 00:29:12,460
 and they'll come back. - Oh, you're joking.

888
00:29:12,460 --> 00:29:15,140
 - And so people flush the fish down the toilet,

889
00:29:15,140 --> 00:29:16,180
 but they're not actually dead.

890
00:29:16,180 --> 00:29:17,740
 They probably don't flush very well either

891
00:29:17,740 --> 00:29:20,180
 'cause they are quite buoyant that stage.

892
00:29:20,180 --> 00:29:21,900
 - Oh, no. - Yeah.

893
00:29:21,900 --> 00:29:23,380
 - That's terrible. - It's public service.

894
00:29:23,380 --> 00:29:24,220
 - Yeah.

895
00:29:24,220 --> 00:29:25,220
 - I was just thinking Mr. Lloyd and fish

896
00:29:25,220 --> 00:29:26,900
 is basically this episode, isn't it?

897
00:29:26,900 --> 00:29:29,480
 (all laughing)

898
00:29:29,480 --> 00:29:32,220
 - Very good.

899
00:29:32,220 --> 00:29:33,500
 Did you know that some children,

900
00:29:33,500 --> 00:29:35,740
 human children can regenerate fingertips.

901
00:29:35,740 --> 00:29:37,300
 Did you, I was astounded when I first--

902
00:29:37,300 --> 00:29:38,780
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah, I had heard that.

903
00:29:38,780 --> 00:29:40,220
 - And many doctors don't know that

904
00:29:40,220 --> 00:29:42,060
 so that they just grow back their fingertips

905
00:29:42,060 --> 00:29:43,700
 if you cut them off. - Yeah.

906
00:29:43,700 --> 00:29:45,660
 Up to a certain, it's kind of much like the stick insect.

907
00:29:45,660 --> 00:29:47,700
 You don't wanna, there's a cut off part, isn't it?

908
00:29:47,700 --> 00:29:50,020
 - And it's under a certain amount of the finger, I think.

909
00:29:50,020 --> 00:29:53,380
 It's not at the base, but it's the top joint.

910
00:29:53,380 --> 00:29:54,540
 - Yeah. - Or the fingernail.

911
00:29:54,540 --> 00:29:56,140
 If there's only a tiny bit of the fingernail left,

912
00:29:56,140 --> 00:29:57,740
 the whole rest of it can grow back.

913
00:29:57,740 --> 00:30:00,740
 - Well, so human children have infinite fingers.

914
00:30:00,740 --> 00:30:01,580
 - Yes.

915
00:30:01,580 --> 00:30:03,740
 - And it's another, don't try this at home, isn't it?

916
00:30:03,740 --> 00:30:05,380
 (all laughing)

917
00:30:05,380 --> 00:30:06,300
 - Speaking of children,

918
00:30:06,300 --> 00:30:08,700
 have you guys heard of John George Children?

919
00:30:08,700 --> 00:30:10,060
 (all laughing)

920
00:30:10,060 --> 00:30:10,900
 - No.

921
00:30:10,900 --> 00:30:14,260
 - He was a famous entomologist of the early 19th century.

922
00:30:14,260 --> 00:30:17,980
 And there's a stick insect called children's stick insect,

923
00:30:17,980 --> 00:30:19,260
 which is named after him.

924
00:30:19,260 --> 00:30:21,220
 - No. - Yeah.

925
00:30:21,220 --> 00:30:22,780
 He was a, as well as an entomologist,

926
00:30:22,780 --> 00:30:24,020
 he was a biologist.

927
00:30:24,020 --> 00:30:26,980
 And one amazing thing he did, in 1815,

928
00:30:26,980 --> 00:30:29,740
 he traveled to the battlefield of Waterloo

929
00:30:29,740 --> 00:30:31,300
 just after the battle.

930
00:30:31,300 --> 00:30:33,380
 And he purchased a tree

931
00:30:33,380 --> 00:30:36,860
 under which the Duke of Wellington had made his headquarters.

932
00:30:36,860 --> 00:30:39,140
 And so he, basically what had happened was,

933
00:30:39,140 --> 00:30:41,100
 the battle had happened and everyone had gone away

934
00:30:41,100 --> 00:30:43,100
 and loads of souvenir hunters were going in

935
00:30:43,100 --> 00:30:45,380
 and sort of chopping bits off this tree.

936
00:30:45,380 --> 00:30:47,780
 But he actually went and bought the entire tree

937
00:30:47,780 --> 00:30:51,540
 and had it made into furniture by Chippendale,

938
00:30:51,540 --> 00:30:52,380
 Thomas Chippendale.

939
00:30:52,380 --> 00:30:53,420
 - Wow. - Wow.

940
00:30:53,420 --> 00:30:54,260
 - Isn't that amazing?

941
00:30:54,260 --> 00:30:55,460
 - Was it called a Waterloo tree?

942
00:30:55,460 --> 00:30:56,420
 Was that, what is that thing?

943
00:30:56,420 --> 00:30:58,420
 - It was called the Elm, Waterloo Elm.

944
00:30:58,420 --> 00:30:59,780
 - Waterloo Elm. - Yeah.

945
00:30:59,780 --> 00:31:00,620
 - That is, wow.

946
00:31:00,620 --> 00:31:02,700
 - And I thought I'd see if John George Children

947
00:31:02,700 --> 00:31:06,100
 had any children and he did.

948
00:31:06,100 --> 00:31:08,740
 He had a daughter called Anna Atkins.

949
00:31:08,740 --> 00:31:12,020
 And she was the first person, we think, possibly,

950
00:31:12,020 --> 00:31:15,660
 to publish a book illustrated with photographic images.

951
00:31:15,660 --> 00:31:19,700
 She was a friend of Fox Talbot,

952
00:31:19,700 --> 00:31:22,100
 who made one of the first cameras.

953
00:31:22,100 --> 00:31:26,180
 And she made a book in 1843, which had photos in it.

954
00:31:26,180 --> 00:31:28,140
 Can you guess what the book was about?

955
00:31:28,140 --> 00:31:31,420
 First ever book with photos in it.

956
00:31:31,420 --> 00:31:32,820
 - Insects, the Battle of Waterloo.

957
00:31:32,820 --> 00:31:34,540
 - It's gonna be third of something.

958
00:31:34,540 --> 00:31:37,020
 - Something slow-moving, tortoises, twigs.

959
00:31:37,020 --> 00:31:38,020
 - Twigs.

960
00:31:38,020 --> 00:31:39,220
 - Children, children.

961
00:31:39,220 --> 00:31:41,980
 - Children, no, it was something very slow-moving.

962
00:31:41,980 --> 00:31:44,580
 - Oh, tortoises, tortoises.

963
00:31:44,580 --> 00:31:45,900
 - Rivers.

964
00:31:45,900 --> 00:31:47,540
 - It was very leisurely rivers.

965
00:31:47,540 --> 00:31:49,500
 - Meandering river.

966
00:31:49,500 --> 00:31:51,780
 - Yeah, something slow-moving, slugs.

967
00:31:51,780 --> 00:31:52,620
 - Smaller.

968
00:31:52,620 --> 00:31:54,140
 - The big book of slug photos.

969
00:31:54,140 --> 00:31:55,700
 Smaller than the slugs, lobsters.

970
00:31:55,700 --> 00:31:56,540
 No, no, that's not small.

971
00:31:56,540 --> 00:31:57,860
 - No, they're bigger than the slugs.

972
00:31:57,860 --> 00:31:58,980
 - Smaller than the slugs.

973
00:31:58,980 --> 00:31:59,820
 - Yeah, the rapids.

974
00:31:59,820 --> 00:32:01,220
 - The snail, is that smaller?

975
00:32:01,220 --> 00:32:02,540
 - That's about the same size.

976
00:32:02,540 --> 00:32:03,380
 - Oh, come on.

977
00:32:03,380 --> 00:32:05,140
 - I mean, much smaller than a slug.

978
00:32:05,140 --> 00:32:06,780
 - Oh, worms, tiny worms.

979
00:32:06,780 --> 00:32:07,620
 - Smaller.

980
00:32:07,620 --> 00:32:09,460
 - Smaller than the worms.

981
00:32:09,460 --> 00:32:11,980
 Parasitic wasps, they're tiny, tiny, tiny.

982
00:32:11,980 --> 00:32:13,580
 - I think a bit bigger than that.

983
00:32:13,580 --> 00:32:14,420
 I'll tell you.

984
00:32:14,420 --> 00:32:15,260
 - Well, there's water bears.

985
00:32:15,260 --> 00:32:16,100
 - Tartigrades.

986
00:32:16,100 --> 00:32:16,940
 - Tartigrades.

987
00:32:16,940 --> 00:32:17,780
 - Tartigrades.

988
00:32:17,780 --> 00:32:18,780
 - The big book of Tartigrade photos.

989
00:32:18,780 --> 00:32:20,100
 That was the first ever.

990
00:32:20,100 --> 00:32:21,900
 - Yeah, was of a Tartigrade.

991
00:32:21,900 --> 00:32:23,140
 No, it was of algae.

992
00:32:23,140 --> 00:32:28,100
 Her book was called Photographs of British Algae,

993
00:32:28,100 --> 00:32:30,260
 Cyanotype Impressions.

994
00:32:30,260 --> 00:32:32,060
 And it came out in October, 1843.

995
00:32:32,060 --> 00:32:33,380
 And that was the first ever book

996
00:32:33,380 --> 00:32:35,700
 illustrated with photographic images.

997
00:32:35,700 --> 00:32:36,540
 - It's very nice.

998
00:32:36,540 --> 00:32:37,580
 - I'm still recovering.

999
00:32:37,580 --> 00:32:38,420
 - Me too, I was about to say--

1000
00:32:38,420 --> 00:32:39,260
 - It's still recovering from that thrilling--

1001
00:32:39,260 --> 00:32:40,540
 - I was about to say, you look great.

1002
00:32:40,540 --> 00:32:42,100
 - How these quizzes really get you

1003
00:32:42,100 --> 00:32:43,740
 feeling like you're doing exercise.

1004
00:32:43,740 --> 00:32:45,460
 - They pump me up.

1005
00:32:45,460 --> 00:32:47,460
 These things are always so,

1006
00:32:47,460 --> 00:32:49,700
 when you do these dives into things,

1007
00:32:49,700 --> 00:32:51,300
 like regeneration, for example,

1008
00:32:51,300 --> 00:32:52,500
 it's so miraculous, isn't it?

1009
00:32:52,500 --> 00:32:54,820
 And all the creatures that can

1010
00:32:54,820 --> 00:32:57,940
 axolotls and salamanders and sharks

1011
00:32:57,940 --> 00:33:00,180
 regenerate teeth all the time.

1012
00:33:00,180 --> 00:33:04,100
 And cockroaches can grow new legs.

1013
00:33:04,100 --> 00:33:04,940
 Did you know that?

1014
00:33:04,940 --> 00:33:06,020
 - No.

1015
00:33:06,020 --> 00:33:09,780
 - And cockroaches have got a bigger genome than people.

1016
00:33:09,780 --> 00:33:10,620
 - Okay.

1017
00:33:10,620 --> 00:33:13,940
 - And they taste inside,

1018
00:33:13,940 --> 00:33:15,260
 the innards of a cockroach.

1019
00:33:15,260 --> 00:33:17,140
 Tastes like blue cheese.

1020
00:33:17,140 --> 00:33:17,980
 - Really?

1021
00:33:17,980 --> 00:33:18,820
 - Amazing, yeah.

1022
00:33:18,820 --> 00:33:21,780
 And axolotls, they've got 30 billion base pairs

1023
00:33:21,780 --> 00:33:22,620
 in their genome.

1024
00:33:22,620 --> 00:33:24,420
 That's 10 times as much as we have.

1025
00:33:24,420 --> 00:33:25,260
 - Wow.

1026
00:33:25,260 --> 00:33:27,020
 - Do you think that guy who was selling axolotls

1027
00:33:27,020 --> 00:33:28,620
 in your shop only had one of them?

1028
00:33:28,620 --> 00:33:30,540
 And he kept selling it, but keeping a leg,

1029
00:33:30,540 --> 00:33:33,540
 so that it would regenerate to a new one.

1030
00:33:33,540 --> 00:33:36,860
 - What a brilliant business model.

1031
00:33:36,860 --> 00:33:38,420
 - That's how I'm thinking.

1032
00:33:38,420 --> 00:33:40,500
 - They're also, the axolotl gets its name

1033
00:33:40,500 --> 00:33:43,180
 from the name of Quetzalcoatl's dog.

1034
00:33:43,180 --> 00:33:44,020
 - Does it?

1035
00:33:44,020 --> 00:33:45,940
 - Yeah, Quetzalcoatl had a dog called axolotl.

1036
00:33:45,940 --> 00:33:47,540
 - Did he think when he went to the vet,

1037
00:33:47,540 --> 00:33:49,620
 it was Quetzalcoatl and axolotl?

1038
00:33:49,620 --> 00:33:52,380
 - Unarmed stick insects,

1039
00:33:52,380 --> 00:33:54,260
 obviously a badly named insect.

1040
00:33:54,260 --> 00:33:55,100
 - Oh, yeah.

1041
00:33:55,100 --> 00:33:57,140
 - And I just want to mention one I found the other day,

1042
00:33:57,140 --> 00:33:59,260
 which is the so-called whispering bat.

1043
00:33:59,260 --> 00:34:02,940
 The so-called whispering bat's call

1044
00:34:02,940 --> 00:34:05,840
 is as loud as a chainsaw or a leaf blower.

1045
00:34:05,840 --> 00:34:06,680
 - Wow.

1046
00:34:06,680 --> 00:34:08,260
 (all laughing)

1047
00:34:08,260 --> 00:34:10,500
 - But the reason it's called the whispering bat

1048
00:34:10,500 --> 00:34:12,460
 is because it's too high-pitched for us to hear.

1049
00:34:12,460 --> 00:34:13,300
 Oh, thank God.

1050
00:34:13,300 --> 00:34:15,700
 Other bats find it deafening.

1051
00:34:15,700 --> 00:34:16,540
 - Yeah, right.

1052
00:34:16,540 --> 00:34:17,380
 - That's funny.

1053
00:34:17,380 --> 00:34:18,860
 - There's so many classic animals

1054
00:34:18,860 --> 00:34:20,780
 that are completely misnamed.

1055
00:34:20,780 --> 00:34:23,820
 So, a few that I found electric eel.

1056
00:34:23,820 --> 00:34:24,660
 - Yes.

1057
00:34:24,660 --> 00:34:25,480
 - Not an eel.

1058
00:34:25,480 --> 00:34:26,320
 - No.

1059
00:34:26,320 --> 00:34:27,860
 - It's a knife fish.

1060
00:34:27,860 --> 00:34:29,020
 The horny toad.

1061
00:34:29,020 --> 00:34:30,340
 - Yep, lizard.

1062
00:34:30,340 --> 00:34:31,180
 - It's a lizard.

1063
00:34:31,180 --> 00:34:32,020
 - Doesn't have much sex.

1064
00:34:32,020 --> 00:34:33,340
 - Doesn't have much sex.

1065
00:34:33,340 --> 00:34:34,180
 - Very sad.

1066
00:34:34,180 --> 00:34:35,140
 - King Cobra's.

1067
00:34:35,140 --> 00:34:35,980
 - Not.

1068
00:34:35,980 --> 00:34:36,820
 - Not Royals.

1069
00:34:36,820 --> 00:34:38,300
 (all laughing)

1070
00:34:38,300 --> 00:34:39,340
 - Not Cobra's.

1071
00:34:39,340 --> 00:34:40,180
 - No, really?

1072
00:34:40,180 --> 00:34:41,020
 - Oh, Cobra's.

1073
00:34:41,020 --> 00:34:42,780
 - Wow, skipjack tuner, not a tuner.

1074
00:34:42,780 --> 00:34:43,620
 - Really?

1075
00:34:43,620 --> 00:34:44,460
 - Is it really?

1076
00:34:44,460 --> 00:34:45,420
 - That's the one that's always on all the tins, isn't it?

1077
00:34:45,420 --> 00:34:46,260
 It's not tuner.

1078
00:34:46,260 --> 00:34:47,260
 It's a completely different genus.

1079
00:34:47,260 --> 00:34:48,620
 - Really?

1080
00:34:48,620 --> 00:34:49,900
 Huh.

1081
00:34:49,900 --> 00:34:50,780
 - Mountain goat?

1082
00:34:50,780 --> 00:34:51,620
 Not a mountain.

1083
00:34:51,620 --> 00:34:53,100
 No, not a goat.

1084
00:34:53,100 --> 00:34:53,940
 - Really?

1085
00:34:53,940 --> 00:34:54,760
 - What?

1086
00:34:54,760 --> 00:34:55,600
 - No.

1087
00:34:55,600 --> 00:34:56,440
 - The list goes on.

1088
00:34:56,440 --> 00:34:57,280
 - Yeah, it does, actually.

1089
00:34:57,280 --> 00:34:59,380
 Mantis shrimp, neither a shrimp nor a mantis.

1090
00:34:59,380 --> 00:35:01,820
 American buffalo's not a buffalo but a bison.

1091
00:35:01,820 --> 00:35:04,660
 Do you know the difference between a buffalo and a bison?

1092
00:35:04,660 --> 00:35:05,820
 - No, I don't, Mr. Hope.

1093
00:35:05,820 --> 00:35:07,160
 (all laughing)

1094
00:35:07,160 --> 00:35:08,900
 - You can't wash your hands on a buffalo.

1095
00:35:08,900 --> 00:35:11,480
 (all laughing)

1096
00:35:11,480 --> 00:35:17,820
 - Okay, it is time for our final fact of the show,

1097
00:35:17,820 --> 00:35:19,760
 and that is loedy.

1098
00:35:20,700 --> 00:35:23,940
 So, I still have to decide which fact to give to you,

1099
00:35:23,940 --> 00:35:25,220
 and I just want to give you some

1100
00:35:25,220 --> 00:35:27,260
 that I didn't choose in the end.

1101
00:35:27,260 --> 00:35:28,860
 (all laughing)

1102
00:35:28,860 --> 00:35:29,700
 - That was a first.

1103
00:35:29,700 --> 00:35:30,900
 - 'Cause I don't want to waste them.

1104
00:35:30,900 --> 00:35:33,500
 To keep warm in the 16th and 17th centuries,

1105
00:35:33,500 --> 00:35:37,020
 boys at British public schools burned the furniture.

1106
00:35:37,020 --> 00:35:39,340
 Horrible, a bit like my school.

1107
00:35:39,340 --> 00:35:40,980
 John Denver's wife, Annie,

1108
00:35:40,980 --> 00:35:42,580
 claimed to have fallen in love with him

1109
00:35:42,580 --> 00:35:45,620
 despite his songs, not because of them.

1110
00:35:45,620 --> 00:35:46,460
 That's very sad.

1111
00:35:46,460 --> 00:35:49,300
 And Toad Suck, Arkansas, recently won a survey

1112
00:35:49,300 --> 00:35:51,740
 to find America's most unfortunate place name,

1113
00:35:51,740 --> 00:35:53,620
 beating Belchartown, Massachusetts,

1114
00:35:53,620 --> 00:35:56,300
 Climax, Georgia, Hooker, Oklahoma,

1115
00:35:56,300 --> 00:35:58,460
 and Rochetown, Illinois.

1116
00:35:58,460 --> 00:36:00,920
 - Well, I'm glad that you didn't do that low-brow one, John.

1117
00:36:00,920 --> 00:36:02,260
 (all laughing)

1118
00:36:02,260 --> 00:36:04,140
 What is your actual fact this week?

1119
00:36:04,140 --> 00:36:08,580
 - My fact is, 45% of Britons do not know

1120
00:36:08,580 --> 00:36:10,020
 where their rectum is.

1121
00:36:10,020 --> 00:36:13,180
 (all laughing)

1122
00:36:13,180 --> 00:36:15,460
 Now, this was according to a poll

1123
00:36:15,460 --> 00:36:18,180
 of 2,000 British adults.

1124
00:36:19,100 --> 00:36:22,060
 Commissioned by Powell Mell Medical Private Health Care

1125
00:36:22,060 --> 00:36:24,780
 in January, 2023.

1126
00:36:24,780 --> 00:36:27,540
 Only 55% of men and women in Britain

1127
00:36:27,540 --> 00:36:30,980
 can confidently state where their rectum is.

1128
00:36:30,980 --> 00:36:34,100
 And only 50% know where their reproductive organs are.

1129
00:36:34,100 --> 00:36:36,340
 - No. - That is impossible.

1130
00:36:36,340 --> 00:36:38,260
 Now, I can sort of understand why this might be

1131
00:36:38,260 --> 00:36:40,020
 because they don't know what the words mean,

1132
00:36:40,020 --> 00:36:42,020
 rectum and reproductive organs.

1133
00:36:42,020 --> 00:36:44,060
 But according to the survey also,

1134
00:36:44,060 --> 00:36:46,980
 an astonishing 37% of Brits

1135
00:36:46,980 --> 00:36:50,420
 cannot say where either their heart or their brain is.

1136
00:36:50,420 --> 00:36:52,020
 (all laughing)

1137
00:36:52,020 --> 00:36:54,260
 - Well, my brain isn't my reproductive system.

1138
00:36:54,260 --> 00:36:57,460
 (all laughing)

1139
00:36:57,460 --> 00:36:58,860
 - 'Cause there's that saying, isn't there?

1140
00:36:58,860 --> 00:37:01,820
 He couldn't find his ass with both hands, yes.

1141
00:37:01,820 --> 00:37:04,820
 And what we're saying is that 45% of British people

1142
00:37:04,820 --> 00:37:05,940
 fall into that. - I don't think we're saying that

1143
00:37:05,940 --> 00:37:08,220
 because to find your rectum with your hands

1144
00:37:08,220 --> 00:37:09,940
 is quite an invasive thing.

1145
00:37:09,940 --> 00:37:11,580
 (all laughing)

1146
00:37:11,580 --> 00:37:13,100
 - Well, I did look it up because I thought,

1147
00:37:13,100 --> 00:37:15,140
 okay, well, that's how ridiculous that is.

1148
00:37:15,140 --> 00:37:18,700
 But I didn't know until yesterday

1149
00:37:18,700 --> 00:37:19,980
 which part of the rectum is,

1150
00:37:19,980 --> 00:37:21,340
 but you know, you've all looked that up.

1151
00:37:21,340 --> 00:37:23,060
 So it's not actually what you think.

1152
00:37:23,060 --> 00:37:25,300
 It's not the anus. - Not the heart.

1153
00:37:25,300 --> 00:37:29,100
 - It's in, there's the anal canal with the anus on one end

1154
00:37:29,100 --> 00:37:30,180
 and then the other end is the rectum,

1155
00:37:30,180 --> 00:37:31,620
 which is basically the poo park

1156
00:37:31,620 --> 00:37:34,380
 where the stuff that comes down the colon

1157
00:37:34,380 --> 00:37:35,740
 is being digested all the way

1158
00:37:35,740 --> 00:37:36,980
 and then it goes into the rectum,

1159
00:37:36,980 --> 00:37:38,820
 which is exactly, it's the storage thing.

1160
00:37:38,820 --> 00:37:39,660
 - Right. - Until--

1161
00:37:39,660 --> 00:37:41,260
 - Is that a medical term, the poo park?

1162
00:37:41,260 --> 00:37:43,460
 (all laughing)

1163
00:37:43,460 --> 00:37:46,820
 - Yeah, same with vagina, I think, as well.

1164
00:37:46,820 --> 00:37:48,780
 Like people think it's the opening,

1165
00:37:48,780 --> 00:37:50,420
 but it's the tube. - Yes.

1166
00:37:50,420 --> 00:37:51,260
 - So that's interesting.

1167
00:37:51,260 --> 00:37:53,340
 I thought the rectum was connected

1168
00:37:53,340 --> 00:37:55,300
 from sort of the bottom of the intestine

1169
00:37:55,300 --> 00:37:57,020
 right to the opening. - No.

1170
00:37:57,020 --> 00:37:58,220
 - I thought that whole thing--

1171
00:37:58,220 --> 00:38:00,220
 - Okay, we've got this, we've covered them.

1172
00:38:00,220 --> 00:38:03,060
 - Count me as one of the 55.

1173
00:38:03,060 --> 00:38:04,860
 - The interesting thing about this survey was

1174
00:38:04,860 --> 00:38:06,060
 it wasn't testing, can you find this?

1175
00:38:06,060 --> 00:38:07,500
 It was saying, are you confident

1176
00:38:07,500 --> 00:38:10,280
 that you could locate where organ X is?

1177
00:38:10,280 --> 00:38:11,120
 - That's interesting.

1178
00:38:11,120 --> 00:38:13,820
 So an 8% of people said they could confidently

1179
00:38:13,820 --> 00:38:14,660
 identify none of them.

1180
00:38:14,660 --> 00:38:15,500
 - None of them?

1181
00:38:15,500 --> 00:38:17,500
 - They just said no, I couldn't identify any.

1182
00:38:17,500 --> 00:38:19,700
 - But surely the brain, everybody must know.

1183
00:38:19,700 --> 00:38:20,820
 - You would think so, yeah.

1184
00:38:20,820 --> 00:38:22,820
 - That's just people with no confidence.

1185
00:38:22,820 --> 00:38:24,140
 - Exactly. - Yeah, it's a confidence thing.

1186
00:38:24,140 --> 00:38:25,620
 - Although we have said before

1187
00:38:25,620 --> 00:38:27,900
 that there is this thing in,

1188
00:38:27,900 --> 00:38:30,380
 is it called Lizardman's Constant or something like that,

1189
00:38:30,380 --> 00:38:33,100
 where in any survey, you will get a percent

1190
00:38:33,100 --> 00:38:35,180
 who will just give a ridiculous answer.

1191
00:38:35,180 --> 00:38:37,900
 - I did wonder whether people,

1192
00:38:37,900 --> 00:38:39,820
 because it was an online survey,

1193
00:38:39,820 --> 00:38:41,520
 it wasn't a person asking my eye to eye.

1194
00:38:41,520 --> 00:38:43,920
 So you wonder, people had a bit too much to drink,

1195
00:38:43,920 --> 00:38:44,880
 they think, oh, I'll just put.

1196
00:38:44,880 --> 00:38:45,720
 - Yeah.

1197
00:38:45,720 --> 00:38:46,880
 - But there was another thing at the other end

1198
00:38:46,880 --> 00:38:48,800
 of the spectrum on this survey,

1199
00:38:48,800 --> 00:38:50,760
 'cause you know, people not identifying

1200
00:38:50,760 --> 00:38:52,280
 where their brain is sounds mad.

1201
00:38:52,280 --> 00:38:54,920
 I also would like to call a slight doubt

1202
00:38:54,920 --> 00:38:57,720
 over the 24% of people, quite high,

1203
00:38:57,720 --> 00:38:59,560
 who claimed they could confidently identify

1204
00:38:59,560 --> 00:39:01,360
 where their pancreas was.

1205
00:39:01,360 --> 00:39:04,120
 - Oh no. - And I think, come on.

1206
00:39:04,120 --> 00:39:06,680
 - Like, I know it's in the middle section, but.

1207
00:39:06,680 --> 00:39:08,160
 - Yeah, yeah, but where?

1208
00:39:08,160 --> 00:39:10,620
 - Well, like the spleen, that was the one,

1209
00:39:10,620 --> 00:39:12,860
 20% claimed to know where their spleen was.

1210
00:39:12,860 --> 00:39:15,020
 I wouldn't have any idea, would give me a break.

1211
00:39:15,020 --> 00:39:17,780
 - Yeah, 20% are not spleen doctors.

1212
00:39:17,780 --> 00:39:19,220
 What's the term, I don't know.

1213
00:39:19,220 --> 00:39:20,580
 - Splenologists?

1214
00:39:20,580 --> 00:39:22,060
 - What's a speleologist?

1215
00:39:22,060 --> 00:39:23,060
 - That's a screwdriver.

1216
00:39:23,060 --> 00:39:25,020
 - Oh no, that's been a terrible mistake.

1217
00:39:25,020 --> 00:39:28,300
 - Don't worry, he's gonna carry out the operation anyway.

1218
00:39:28,300 --> 00:39:30,300
 He says it'll be just like a cave, probably.

1219
00:39:30,300 --> 00:39:32,820
 - He's never been in an anal canal before.

1220
00:39:32,820 --> 00:39:34,580
 - I tend to do a lot of these things now

1221
00:39:34,580 --> 00:39:37,300
 when I'm trying to get access to a news article online.

1222
00:39:37,300 --> 00:39:40,400
 - They often, a lot of websites will have like,

1223
00:39:40,400 --> 00:39:42,740
 just fill this quick survey in quickly and.

1224
00:39:42,740 --> 00:39:44,100
 - See the way your rectum is.

1225
00:39:44,100 --> 00:39:45,440
 - Yeah.

1226
00:39:45,440 --> 00:39:47,920
 - What kind of websites are you trying to get onto then?

1227
00:39:47,920 --> 00:39:49,560
 - Please turn on your webcam.

1228
00:39:49,560 --> 00:39:53,520
 Show us your rectum.

1229
00:39:53,520 --> 00:39:55,160
 - I find it interesting that don't knows

1230
00:39:55,160 --> 00:39:56,280
 in surveys as well.

1231
00:39:56,280 --> 00:39:59,040
 And so YouGov always include their don't knows.

1232
00:39:59,040 --> 00:40:00,720
 And there was an article about this in Wired

1233
00:40:00,720 --> 00:40:03,080
 a few years ago by a writer called Amit Katwala.

1234
00:40:03,080 --> 00:40:04,800
 And it's a great point 'cause YouGov

1235
00:40:04,800 --> 00:40:06,640
 did a survey about surfing, right?

1236
00:40:06,640 --> 00:40:09,140
 Have you ever been surfing or not?

1237
00:40:09,140 --> 00:40:12,380
 In which 3% of people said, "I don't know."

1238
00:40:12,380 --> 00:40:16,900
 And it's a big thing to not know if you've tried surfing.

1239
00:40:16,900 --> 00:40:19,180
 2% don't know if they've lived in London.

1240
00:40:19,180 --> 00:40:20,700
 (laughing)

1241
00:40:20,700 --> 00:40:22,100
 - They could be on the outskirts.

1242
00:40:22,100 --> 00:40:24,220
 - Possible, yeah, I guess, yeah.

1243
00:40:24,220 --> 00:40:25,980
 - All born in London but left straight away.

1244
00:40:25,980 --> 00:40:27,820
 Oh, I don't know if we've lived there for a couple of months.

1245
00:40:27,820 --> 00:40:29,420
 - Okay, here's one from 2023.

1246
00:40:29,420 --> 00:40:31,660
 Do you and your romantic partner each have your own side

1247
00:40:31,660 --> 00:40:33,940
 of the bed that you sleep on, okay?

1248
00:40:33,940 --> 00:40:35,260
 And if you don't currently have a partner,

1249
00:40:35,260 --> 00:40:36,600
 please think about the last partner you have.

1250
00:40:36,600 --> 00:40:38,720
 77% we each have our own side.

1251
00:40:38,720 --> 00:40:42,680
 4% chaotic, we sleep on whichever side, absolutely insane.

1252
00:40:42,680 --> 00:40:44,220
 But 6% don't know.

1253
00:40:44,220 --> 00:40:45,160
 - Yeah.

1254
00:40:45,160 --> 00:40:46,160
 - How do you not know?

1255
00:40:46,160 --> 00:40:47,800
 - I would say it would be different depending

1256
00:40:47,800 --> 00:40:49,360
 on which bed you're sleeping in.

1257
00:40:49,360 --> 00:40:51,920
 Like in our home bed, we sleep on the same size.

1258
00:40:51,920 --> 00:40:53,400
 But if you go to a hotel.

1259
00:40:53,400 --> 00:40:54,240
 - Then it's anything goes.

1260
00:40:54,240 --> 00:40:55,240
 Completely. - Exactly.

1261
00:40:55,240 --> 00:40:57,280
 Well, it's not, it's whatever my wife wants to do.

1262
00:40:57,280 --> 00:40:59,040
 (laughing)

1263
00:40:59,040 --> 00:41:02,320
 - In 2017, a survey found that half of British gardeners

1264
00:41:02,320 --> 00:41:05,040
 cannot name a single shrub.

1265
00:41:05,040 --> 00:41:08,900
 And the next year in 2018, a poll found that 80% of Britons

1266
00:41:08,900 --> 00:41:11,940
 couldn't pick out their own neighbors in a police lineup.

1267
00:41:11,940 --> 00:41:13,100
 I thought that was quite strong.

1268
00:41:13,100 --> 00:41:14,420
 - That's interesting.

1269
00:41:14,420 --> 00:41:15,340
 - And how did they test that?

1270
00:41:15,340 --> 00:41:17,220
 Did they do some lineups?

1271
00:41:17,220 --> 00:41:18,620
 I'd like to know that, yes.

1272
00:41:18,620 --> 00:41:19,460
 - That'd be great.

1273
00:41:19,460 --> 00:41:21,780
 - It wasn't a Daily Mail, though, so maybe it's...

1274
00:41:21,780 --> 00:41:22,780
 - Can you name a shrub?

1275
00:41:22,780 --> 00:41:24,780
 'Cause I think shrub,

1276
00:41:24,780 --> 00:41:27,340
 is that like a specific type of plant is a shrub?

1277
00:41:27,340 --> 00:41:30,220
 - I agree, I mean, I garden, and you know.

1278
00:41:30,220 --> 00:41:31,740
 - I have something that looks like a shrub,

1279
00:41:31,740 --> 00:41:34,380
 which is Nazalia, is that a shrub?

1280
00:41:34,380 --> 00:41:35,220
 - I don't know.

1281
00:41:35,220 --> 00:41:38,040
 - Is it a little Leylandi bush, a shrub?

1282
00:41:38,040 --> 00:41:39,560
 - A bush is a part of the body, isn't it?

1283
00:41:39,560 --> 00:41:40,400
 I think that...

1284
00:41:40,400 --> 00:41:41,560
 (laughing)

1285
00:41:41,560 --> 00:41:43,160
 - Most people don't know why that is.

1286
00:41:43,160 --> 00:41:44,600
 - I don't know where their bush is.

1287
00:41:44,600 --> 00:41:46,200
 (laughing)

1288
00:41:46,200 --> 00:41:48,000
 - Well, let's think of a shrub, it must be a shrub.

1289
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:50,200
 Is it a laurel, is that a tree?

1290
00:41:50,200 --> 00:41:51,320
 - I think that's a shrub, is it?

1291
00:41:51,320 --> 00:41:52,840
 - I think it's a size thing, isn't it?

1292
00:41:52,840 --> 00:41:54,440
 Over a certain size, a shrub becomes a tree.

1293
00:41:54,440 --> 00:41:56,680
 - I think we've shown that this is a very difficult thing

1294
00:41:56,680 --> 00:41:57,520
 to know.

1295
00:41:57,520 --> 00:41:58,360
 (laughing)

1296
00:41:58,360 --> 00:41:59,400
 - We always jump when you're on the show,

1297
00:41:59,400 --> 00:42:01,000
 we get into the deep questions.

1298
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:02,680
 (laughing)

1299
00:42:02,680 --> 00:42:04,320
 - Can I do one more survey?

1300
00:42:04,320 --> 00:42:05,620
 - Just this is a silly survey,

1301
00:42:05,620 --> 00:42:07,020
 it's not really that much on topic,

1302
00:42:07,020 --> 00:42:09,260
 but there was a poll quite recently

1303
00:42:09,260 --> 00:42:13,100
 about what Britons aged 18 to 29,

1304
00:42:13,100 --> 00:42:15,700
 so this is young people according to the survey.

1305
00:42:15,700 --> 00:42:19,820
 What is the least cool hand gesture a person can make?

1306
00:42:19,820 --> 00:42:21,100
 - Oh, that's great! - Just that it's a good quiz.

1307
00:42:21,100 --> 00:42:22,180
 - Yeah, okay, cool.

1308
00:42:22,180 --> 00:42:23,420
 - Okay, can I have a punt?

1309
00:42:23,420 --> 00:42:24,260
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1310
00:42:24,260 --> 00:42:27,780
 - I think the peace sign is not cool.

1311
00:42:27,780 --> 00:42:29,100
 - Oh, do you know, I do that all the time.

1312
00:42:29,100 --> 00:42:30,580
 - I do it all the time, but I just don't,

1313
00:42:30,580 --> 00:42:31,500
 I don't think it's cool.

1314
00:42:31,500 --> 00:42:32,340
 - Oh, okay.

1315
00:42:32,340 --> 00:42:34,700
 - Possibly the horns, the rock horns.

1316
00:42:34,700 --> 00:42:38,100
 - Oh, that's like a cuckold in Southern Europe.

1317
00:42:38,100 --> 00:42:38,940
 - Oh, yeah.

1318
00:42:38,940 --> 00:42:39,780
 (laughing)

1319
00:42:39,780 --> 00:42:40,620
 - No, it's not that.

1320
00:42:40,620 --> 00:42:42,100
 - Careful at Southern European Metallica gigs,

1321
00:42:42,100 --> 00:42:43,600
 which I know you love to go to, Dan.

1322
00:42:43,600 --> 00:42:45,820
 (laughing)

1323
00:42:45,820 --> 00:42:46,660
 - The thumbs up.

1324
00:42:46,660 --> 00:42:47,500
 - The thumbs up.

1325
00:42:47,500 --> 00:42:49,720
 - Thumbs up, that was in the poll.

1326
00:42:49,720 --> 00:42:50,620
 It wasn't the worst,

1327
00:42:50,620 --> 00:42:52,500
 but a lot of people thought it was quite cringe.

1328
00:42:52,500 --> 00:42:53,420
 - A-okay.

1329
00:42:53,420 --> 00:42:54,980
 - That was cringe, but not the worst.

1330
00:42:54,980 --> 00:42:55,820
 - The phone, call me.

1331
00:42:55,820 --> 00:42:57,300
 - In fact, the double A-okay

1332
00:42:57,300 --> 00:42:59,540
 is one of the most cringe-worthy signs.

1333
00:42:59,540 --> 00:43:00,740
 - Oh, air quotes!

1334
00:43:00,740 --> 00:43:01,580
 Are they the--

1335
00:43:01,580 --> 00:43:02,420
 - Yeah, that's pretty good.

1336
00:43:02,420 --> 00:43:03,260
 - The most now.

1337
00:43:03,260 --> 00:43:04,980
 - I actually think if anyone had thought of that,

1338
00:43:04,980 --> 00:43:06,380
 they would have gone for it.

1339
00:43:06,380 --> 00:43:07,700
 Hey, John, do you want to have a guess or?

1340
00:43:07,700 --> 00:43:08,700
 - Wankings.

1341
00:43:08,700 --> 00:43:10,740
 - Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1342
00:43:10,740 --> 00:43:12,740
 - Sorry, Philippa Perry.

1343
00:43:12,740 --> 00:43:14,660
 She basically answered the word "wank"

1344
00:43:14,660 --> 00:43:16,980
 for every question we asked her as she came on the show.

1345
00:43:16,980 --> 00:43:19,100
 (laughing)

1346
00:43:19,100 --> 00:43:22,940
 It is, and this is 38% of people said this.

1347
00:43:22,940 --> 00:43:25,220
 It's playing an air guitar.

1348
00:43:25,220 --> 00:43:26,180
 - Oh!

1349
00:43:26,180 --> 00:43:28,980
 - Like a Wild Stallions' Bill and Ted thing.

1350
00:43:28,980 --> 00:43:29,980
 - That is pretty embarrassing.

1351
00:43:29,980 --> 00:43:30,980
 - Oh, come on, it's cool.

1352
00:43:30,980 --> 00:43:31,820
 (laughing)

1353
00:43:31,820 --> 00:43:32,660
 - Okay.

1354
00:43:32,660 --> 00:43:33,660
 - How old are you, Dad?

1355
00:43:33,660 --> 00:43:34,980
 (laughing)

1356
00:43:34,980 --> 00:43:37,460
 - The right age, to know that's cool.

1357
00:43:37,460 --> 00:43:39,660
 Rectum?

1358
00:43:39,660 --> 00:43:41,660
 - Okay, let's talk rectums.

1359
00:43:41,660 --> 00:43:44,700
 The US Consumer Product Safety Commission every year

1360
00:43:44,700 --> 00:43:46,340
 do a list of things that have been found

1361
00:43:46,340 --> 00:43:48,180
 in people's orifices.

1362
00:43:48,180 --> 00:43:49,020
 - Really?

1363
00:43:49,020 --> 00:43:53,060
 - Yeah, the 2022 list include a monopoly piece,

1364
00:43:53,060 --> 00:43:57,020
 a reusable ice pack, a fishing pole.

1365
00:43:57,020 --> 00:43:57,860
 - No.

1366
00:43:57,860 --> 00:43:58,700
 (laughing)

1367
00:43:58,700 --> 00:44:00,180
 - It can't have been the entire pole.

1368
00:44:00,180 --> 00:44:01,300
 - Well, they're collapsible, aren't they?

1369
00:44:01,300 --> 00:44:02,140
 - They collapse, yeah.

1370
00:44:02,140 --> 00:44:02,960
 - Oh, do they?

1371
00:44:02,960 --> 00:44:03,800
 - Yeah.

1372
00:44:03,800 --> 00:44:05,180
 - Yeah, okay, well, it could have been that.

1373
00:44:05,180 --> 00:44:08,860
 And in other orifices, a golf ball in the vagina,

1374
00:44:08,860 --> 00:44:11,060
 an expensive coin from a coin collection

1375
00:44:11,060 --> 00:44:14,660
 in someone's throat and a USB card in someone's penis.

1376
00:44:14,660 --> 00:44:16,540
 - Oh, a USB?

1377
00:44:16,540 --> 00:44:17,380
 - Yeah.

1378
00:44:17,380 --> 00:44:18,220
 (laughing)

1379
00:44:18,220 --> 00:44:19,060
 - It's brilliant.

1380
00:44:19,060 --> 00:44:19,900
 - You've got to make sure you put it in the right way round.

1381
00:44:19,900 --> 00:44:21,540
 - Yeah, exactly.

1382
00:44:21,540 --> 00:44:23,180
 Wow, that's brilliant.

1383
00:44:23,180 --> 00:44:25,860
 Yeah, there was a guy also a 68-year-old man

1384
00:44:25,860 --> 00:44:28,700
 with hemorrhoids in Hubei province in China

1385
00:44:28,700 --> 00:44:32,700
 who had to have a 10-inch chopstick pulled out of his anus,

1386
00:44:32,700 --> 00:44:33,540
 which he put up there.

1387
00:44:33,540 --> 00:44:35,240
 He said, "Out of curiosity."

1388
00:44:35,240 --> 00:44:37,660
 (laughing)

1389
00:44:37,660 --> 00:44:38,500
 - Fair play, yeah.

1390
00:44:38,500 --> 00:44:41,060
 - I haven't listened to the Museum of Curiosity this series.

1391
00:44:41,060 --> 00:44:42,140
 John, is there?

1392
00:44:42,140 --> 00:44:42,980
 (laughing)

1393
00:44:42,980 --> 00:44:44,460
 - I'd like to donate this chopstick.

1394
00:44:44,460 --> 00:44:46,180
 (laughing)

1395
00:44:46,180 --> 00:44:49,180
 - And just while I was talking about emergency visits

1396
00:44:49,180 --> 00:44:54,140
 in 2022, I found a list of quite a few here or some.

1397
00:44:54,140 --> 00:44:55,460
 This is in the U.S.

1398
00:44:55,460 --> 00:44:58,580
 "Pain after rubbing penis too hard with a loofah."

1399
00:44:58,580 --> 00:45:01,820
 "Playing with pocket knife, accidentally stabbed penis.

1400
00:45:01,820 --> 00:45:03,620
 "Closed penis in fridge door."

1401
00:45:03,620 --> 00:45:05,300
 (laughing)

1402
00:45:05,300 --> 00:45:09,060
 "And watched football, got excited when team scored

1403
00:45:09,060 --> 00:45:11,920
 "and accidentally punched self in penis."

1404
00:45:11,920 --> 00:45:12,760
 - Oh.

1405
00:45:12,760 --> 00:45:13,600
 (laughing)

1406
00:45:13,600 --> 00:45:16,260
 - Here are all ER visits in the U.S. last year.

1407
00:45:16,260 --> 00:45:17,260
 - That's amazing.

1408
00:45:17,260 --> 00:45:19,840
 (upbeat music)

1409
00:45:19,840 --> 00:45:23,140
 - Okay, that's it.

1410
00:45:23,140 --> 00:45:24,180
 That is all of our facts.

1411
00:45:24,180 --> 00:45:25,540
 Thank you so much for listening.

1412
00:45:25,540 --> 00:45:27,540
 If you'd like to get in contact with any of us

1413
00:45:27,540 --> 00:45:29,260
 about the things that we've said over the course

1414
00:45:29,260 --> 00:45:31,820
 of this podcast, we can be found on our Twitter accounts.

1415
00:45:31,820 --> 00:45:33,820
 I'm on @Sriberland, James.

1416
00:45:33,820 --> 00:45:34,780

 - Oh, yeah, of course.

1422
00:45:43,660 --> 00:45:45,020
 - I don't know, I didn't have a special account.

1423
00:45:45,020 --> 00:45:46,940
 - Yeah, yeah, or @Quickipedia, I guess,

1424
00:45:46,940 --> 00:45:48,700
 for like the total hub.

1425
00:45:48,700 --> 00:45:50,380
 But yeah, find @Loydie on Instagram.

1426
00:45:50,380 --> 00:45:51,620
 - But we do Instagrams.

1427
00:45:51,620 --> 00:45:52,460
 - Yeah.

1428
00:45:52,460 --> 00:45:53,300
 - Yeah, we've done that before.

1429
00:45:53,300 --> 00:45:54,140
 - That's a good point.

1430
00:45:54,140 --> 00:45:54,980
 Well, I'm on @Sriberland.

1431
00:45:54,980 --> 00:45:57,020
 - I'm on no such thing as James Harkin.

1432
00:45:57,020 --> 00:45:58,620
 - Mine is private, you'll never find it.

1433
00:45:58,620 --> 00:46:00,060
 (laughing)

1434
00:46:00,060 --> 00:46:02,820
 - And mine is @JohnLloydQI.

1435
00:46:02,820 --> 00:46:05,740
 - All right, and we don't have a fish Instagram,

1436
00:46:05,740 --> 00:46:07,620
 but we do have a fish Twitter account,

1437
00:46:07,620 --> 00:46:08,860

00:46:08,860 --> 00:46:09,940
 Or you can go to our website,

 And that's it for now.

 We'll be back again next week with another episode.

1443
00:46:17,860 --> 00:46:19,900
 Thank you, John, for officially opening

1444
00:46:19,900 --> 00:46:22,700
