00:00:01,640 --> 00:00:07,840
 Hi everyone, welcome to this week's episode of No Such Thing as a Fish. Ho, ho, ho, it's nearly Christmas.

3
00:00:07,840 --> 00:00:12,640
 The presents are already wrapped. You've already bought your copy of everything to play for.

4
00:00:12,640 --> 00:00:15,600
 The QI Book of Sport by James Harkin and Anna Tyshinski.

5
00:00:15,600 --> 00:00:19,120
 You've already bought your copy of The Theory of Everything Else by Dan Schreiber.

6
00:00:19,120 --> 00:00:24,960
 And you've already bought two copies of The Sanctuary and The Last Day by Andrew Hunter Murray.

7
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:29,760
 The Sprouts are simmering. The quality streets are already been mostly eaten

8
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:35,280
 apart from the horrible ones. And what else is there to do apart from listening to some podcasts?

9
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:39,680
 Well, what do we have for you? It's basically the start of our Christmas season.

10
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:45,280
 We're already in the Christmas mood. So the next three episodes are all special episodes.

11
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:51,680
 The first one you're going to hear right now is a look back at 2023. All of our favorite facts from

12
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:57,600
 the news of this year. Recorded live at the Soho Theatre in London. Then next week you're going

13
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:02,640
 to get our Christmas special where again at the Soho Theatre we talked about all of our favorite

14
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:08,080
 facts about Christmas, food and drink. And then in the silly season between Christmas and New Year

15
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:14,080
 you'll get a very special show where Andy opens up the mailbox and finds all the facts that you

16
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:18,320
 sent us over the last couple of years. And we discuss those, find out which ones are true,

17
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:23,040
 which ones are not true, which ones are interesting and which ones, frankly, you probably shouldn't

18
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:29,280
 have sent in that drunken stupid at 2am. Anyway, really hope you enjoyed these three episodes.

19
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:33,920
 I'm away from my desk for the next couple of weeks so I'll be enjoying them with you too and

20
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:39,680
 we will see you in the New Year. Okay, there's not much more to say apart from to remind you to

21
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:44,240
 buy all of those books. Go to know such things as a fish dot com forward slash books to find

22
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:50,080
 information about those. But sit back, relax, put your feet up and listen to this week's episode

23
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:53,520
 of Know Such Things as a Fish. Okay, on with the podcast.

24
00:01:53,520 --> 00:02:12,880
 Hello and welcome to another episode of Know Such Things as a Fish, a weekly podcast this week

25
00:02:12,880 --> 00:02:23,200
 coming to you live from the Soho Theatre in London. My name is Dan Schreiber. I am sitting here

26
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:29,920
 with Anna Tyshinski, Andrew Hunter Murray and James Harkin. And once again, we have gathered

27
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:34,480
 around the microphone with our four favorite facts, but this time with our four favorite facts from

28
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:40,880
 the News of the Year 2023. And in no particular order here we go. Starting with fact number one,

29
00:02:40,880 --> 00:02:48,560
 and that is Andy. My fact is that after a journey of 60 million miles this year, NASA finally brought

30
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:54,080
 a fragment of an asteroid back to Earth in a special capsule. Unfortunately, they can't get

31
00:02:54,080 --> 00:03:01,680
 into it because they don't have the right screwdriver. Pretty amazing. It's one of Philip's heads,

32
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:07,920
 isn't it? Yeah, it's a crosshead problem. No, so this is true. So NASA launched a mission to an

33
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:18,160
 asteroid called Bennu, which is big and it's about... Slow down, Professor. Sorry. It's not that big

34
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:23,600
 actually, but it's like it's chunky enough to do some damage if it hit the Earth, which it might

35
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:28,880
 at some point in the next 300 years. Not imminent, but we need to keep an eye on it. Wouldn't it be

36
00:03:28,880 --> 00:03:35,280
 ironic if it came down, hit the Earth, and then the box just sort of sprang open? So it's not why

37
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:38,720
 we're getting bit. Are they going back and forth, back and forth, gradually making it smaller and

38
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:45,120
 smaller in the next 300 years? That's it. What a great idea. It's not... Yeah! It's not exactly what...

39
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:49,760
 I think they're doing it because it was nearer than a lot of other asteroids and it's worth studying,

40
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:54,800
 basically. So it's 500 meters across, which is not tiny. It's called the most dangerous rock in the

41
00:03:54,800 --> 00:04:00,640
 solar system. That sounds pretty bad. Yeah, but isn't that truly the most dangerous rock, Earth?

42
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:10,160
 That's a good thought. Anyway, because it's home to man... No, we got it. Sorry, okay. We understand.

43
00:04:10,160 --> 00:04:14,640
 So what's the deal? They've built a box that they can't open. Yeah, we are. Because particularly,

44
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:19,120
 it didn't come in the box. The asteroid didn't arrive in the box. That would be more worthy of

45
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:23,280
 study, if anything. But no, it's very, very old as well. It hasn't changed its composition for four

46
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:27,520
 billion years, which is why it's worth studying as well. It predates the solar system. That's

47
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:32,160
 pretty interesting. So NASA launched this amazing mission. They launched it seven years ago. It

48
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:38,160
 took four years to get to Bennu. It landed. Oh, in fact, it didn't even land. So it just sort of

49
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:43,040
 nicked the edge of it. It scraped it for six seconds. It just touched the edge of it, grabbed

50
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:48,000
 some fragments from it, got those into a specially made capsule, an incredibly good capsule.

51
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:53,920
 And then it finally landed back on Earth this year. Sounds like it pickpocketed the asteroid,

52
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:58,240
 doesn't it? It did. The thing I read said it touched its bottom for six seconds, which is...

53
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:04,480
 But isn't that amazing? Amber behaviour, yeah. I often get blown away by the precision of science

54
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:10,000
 in space, where that's your window. If you miss that, it's probably a big deal to have to turn

55
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:16,720
 around, go back. It probably would be. So they're like, but six seconds. That's what we have. Six

56
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:21,040
 seconds. It's incredible. It's wonderful. And the problem is now it's in a glove box, right? Yes.

57
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:24,560
 And they can't get it out of the glove box. They call it a glove box, don't they? Yeah, and it's

58
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:28,880
 especially, it's a really good box. It's a really good box, but you have to wear gloves to get into

59
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:33,360
 it. Yeah. You know those things like, I don't know how to describe them, but it's like a Perspex box,

60
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:37,200
 and the kind of rubber gloves are attached to the box. Oh, yeah. And you have to put them in, which

61
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:42,320
 is weird. Like when they're dismantling a bomb or they're... Did they do that? Like Homer. Homer is

62
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:46,000
 the beginning of the Simpsons. That is the bomb. That's just like a new... No, no, no. I was thinking

63
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:51,840
 of the movie Speed and then I went to the Simpsons very quickly. I want to know who's put a bomb

64
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:56,880
 inside this Perspex box. Yeah. It's such a weird place to put a bomb, isn't it? Thank God they put

65
00:05:56,880 --> 00:06:01,440
 it there though. You can get to it safely. So what is true here? You have to wear special gloves to open

66
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:05,200
 this box because they've forgotten the gloves. Inside the glove box, you're not allowed to put

67
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:10,080
 just anything in there because it's such a sealed environment. They've got some tools in there already,

68
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:15,360
 but none of them is the right tool. They've undone all bars, two of the screws. There were loads of

69
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:19,120
 screws originally. It wasn't just two, but the last two are proving really fiddly and they can't just

70
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:24,560
 use a Phillips screwdriver because everything has to be... It's a clean room and they can't

71
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:28,880
 get any... I think it's filled with nitrogen because it'll react with oxygen and that'll

72
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:33,920
 be a disaster. So they're having to be so careful. The amount they've got inside the box is about

73
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:41,040
 the weight of a hamster, roughly. We don't know it's not a hamster. No. There's no way of knowing.

74
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:47,760
 Well, it is see-through, so we can see it's not a hamster. Also, it came with a load of bonus

75
00:06:47,760 --> 00:06:51,760
 stuff, like when it's gooped into the.... Oh, this stuff! Sorry. When they scooped...

76
00:06:51,760 --> 00:06:57,360
 What else? A T-shirt saying my dad went to this asteroid and all I got was this shitty shirt.

77
00:06:57,360 --> 00:07:00,800
 When they did the scraping, most of it ended up in the capsule, but there's loads of other stuff

78
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:05,120
 around the edge of the capsule, another 70 grams or so. So they have started studying that already.

79
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:09,520
 Okay. It's very exciting. Have you seen the screws that they can't get into? Yes. This is a piece of

80
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:13,600
 them. It basically looks like an allen key, doesn't it? It does. But it's like, you know,

81
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:17,200
 you can never quite get the right size of allen key. Yeah. That's what it looks like. I think that's

82
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:20,960
 what it is, isn't it? I think so. So when can we get in, do you think? Well, they're sort of

83
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:25,760
 designing special tools to get into it. It's not going to be forever. But I mean, task rabbit is

84
00:07:25,760 --> 00:07:30,640
 very good for this sort of thing like that. But they do they do know a couple of things already

85
00:07:30,640 --> 00:07:35,680
 from it, which is really exciting. And so Britain has a little bit of it, very thrilling. Sorry. I

86
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:41,680
 said Britain has a bit of the sample, very thrilling. Wait a minute, how can that be?

87
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:47,040
 Yeah, well, it's all in a box. No, no, no. Because there was 70 grams of bonus material outside the

88
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:52,160
 box. So that has been parceled up and sent around the place a bit. Britain has 100 milligrams total.

89
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:56,560
 Brilliant. Yeah. It's unfortunately it's now been sent to Rwanda.

90
00:07:56,560 --> 00:08:06,400
 Well, it will be. Yeah. But this I read a thing about the scientists who are looking at it and

91
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:11,520
 they're analyzing it grain by grain. They have such detailed studies that they can do that some

92
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:14,720
 of them said, yeah, we might be looking at this for the rest of our careers. And it's literally

93
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:19,680
 100 milligrams of dirt. And what are they trying to what do you think they're trying to work out

94
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:24,960
 from what they're studying? The origin of like clues to the origin of the solar system. Yeah.

95
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:29,520
 Okay, right. Apparently it contains nanoglobuls of organic material, which sounds faintly.

96
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:35,600
 Ah, so that could show that maybe a life can be ceded around the universe as well by asteroids.

97
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:39,680
 That's always what they're hoping for, isn't it? No, but it's just a little bit of dust, lifeless

98
00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:43,440
 dust. Another bit of lifeless dust. But there are things in that there are things called pre-solar

99
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:47,520
 grains, which this is so cool, right? These are grains of particles. They're less than one micron

100
00:08:47,520 --> 00:08:53,200
 across, which really is very small. And they belong to the previous dead stars and ancient kind of

101
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:59,120
 cosmic dust that our solar system formed from. So they're like the ingredients of our sun, but

102
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:04,160
 before our sun formed are on this thing. Wow. That's cool. There's also, as we're recording in

103
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:11,600
 the last day or so, been a very exciting discovery made by NASA as well. They found a tomato that's

104
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:18,800
 been missing on the International Space Station for eight months. That's not still going to be good.

105
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:24,720
 It's not going to be good. You'd eat it. But there was... I'd eat it. Yeah, I'll have it if it's still

106
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:29,680
 going. There was a guy called Frank Rubio, and he was basically doing a harvest up on the International

107
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:33,360
 Space Station. He had a bunch of little tomatoes and other things, and one of them just went missing.

108
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:36,160
 And he got accused of eating, and he was like, "I didn't eat it." And they're like, "Well, we can't

109
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:40,400
 find it anywhere." He left the International Space Station. It's been eight months. And just

110
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:43,920
 yesterday, someone was like, "Is that the tomato that has been..." That's incredible.

111
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:49,120
 And it's all shriveled and all disintegrated. Wow. Yeah, so... And he's back on Earth going,

112
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:53,040
 "I told you so." He literally is, because every press conference, they were like, "Yeah, yeah,

113
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:58,400
 yeah, yeah, great stuff about space. The tomato, did you definitely not eat it? Because it feels

114
00:09:58,400 --> 00:10:04,240
 like you did." And it's... You know, the International Space Station is about six bedrooms worth of

115
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:08,560
 room if you were walking through it. It'd be a house with six bedrooms. It's quite big.

116
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:13,520
 But you would think you'd be able to find a tomato. Oh, I don't know. Cherry tomato or normal

117
00:10:13,520 --> 00:10:19,440
 tomato? So it's a... Yeah, it's like more like a cherry tomato. I think we have a format here,

118
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:25,360
 actually. Yeah. OK, so it's the four of us. Yeah. We go to a celebrity's house. Sure.

119
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:32,960
 Yeah, it's like through the keyhole. Yeah. We hide the tomatoes somewhere in the

120
00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:38,480
 celebrity's house. And they have to find it. But what's the through the keyhole bit? Well,

121
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:43,360
 the interesting part is not finding the tomato. That's deadly boring. You actually get to see

122
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:46,560
 the celebrity's house. Oh, because you're going through their underwear drawer, because they're a

123
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:51,760
 tomato. Yeah, yeah, yeah. OK. But then the problem is you go around Alan Titchmark's house, because

124
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:56,960
 it's fucking tomatoes everywhere. That's the last page of where's Wally? I remember. There's just

125
00:10:56,960 --> 00:11:04,800
 loads of Wally's. Yeah, that's right. Alan Titchmark included. Yeah. OK. So, you know,

126
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:07,920
 these people, you're talking about Andy, who travelled millions and millions of miles to get

127
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:13,360
 this cosmic bit of asteroid. Well, they didn't. I mean, it was an uncrewed mission. You're right.

128
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:19,120
 They sent out their little drone. They didn't need to do it, because there's loads of it on

129
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:23,520
 earth, isn't there? As I think we've discussed before, lots of bits of asteroid raining down on

130
00:11:23,520 --> 00:11:29,520
 earth all the time. And this was in the news this year, because scientists have identified 13

131
00:11:29,520 --> 00:11:35,920
 cathedrals that they're going to start vacuuming for bits of asteroid. Wow. Really? The Guttus?

132
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:43,440
 And the... Or inside the... The roofs. Yeah. Yeah, up top. So, it's the Penny Vosniakiewicz

133
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:50,560
 and the Matthias van Ginneken. And they basically want to understand how bits of debris from space

134
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:53,440
 come to earth. These sound like two Russian guys, and they're going to come looking at

135
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:59,520
 our cathedrals, aren't they? They've done souls, Bree, and they like what they saw.

136
00:11:59,520 --> 00:12:06,880
 No, it's a man and a woman who I don't think are related to Putin's regime in any way.

137
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:12,000
 But, yeah, they've said here are 13 cathedrals, like Kent Cathedral, Canterbury Cathedral,

138
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:18,480
 all the big guns. And they go up onto the roofs of the cathedrals with these big hoovers on their backs,

139
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:22,000
 like ghostbusters. Yeah, amazing. They climb up the walls, they climb onto the roofs,

140
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:26,560
 and then they just hoover up all this dust. And the idea is that remnants of asteroids and

141
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:33,280
 comets can be found amongst, obviously, just lots of shit. Did you say why it's cathedrals in particular,

142
00:12:33,280 --> 00:12:37,520
 as opposed to residential houses? It's cathedrals because they're touched far less often, so it'll

143
00:12:37,520 --> 00:12:42,080
 be undisturbed because not many people hang out on top of cathedrals. Super old. Super old. Right.

144
00:12:42,080 --> 00:12:48,240
 Yes, very old, but also very well recorded when they've been redone, when they've been revamped.

145
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:51,920
 You always have good records for it, so if they find a bit of space dust, then they'll know,

146
00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:56,720
 well, this bit of roof was redone in the 1960s, so that's how long this has been there. Yeah, yeah,

147
00:12:56,720 --> 00:13:03,120
 yeah. They found another asteroid that possibly could hit the earth on Valentine's Day in 2046.

148
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:08,160
 So that's something to bear in mind when you're buying your gifts that year.

149
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:15,840
 What, don't bother. No, bother, yeah. You've got a 600 to one chance of this asteroid hitting

150
00:13:15,840 --> 00:13:21,840
 earth on that day, which is the same as an average flight being cancelled or delayed by three hours.

151
00:13:21,840 --> 00:13:25,200
 Wow. Because that has happened to me. It does seem to happen quite a lot, doesn't it?

152
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:29,200
 One in 600, I thought. You're fine, yeah. Yeah. But is it okay if it hits it?

153
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:34,160
 Is it definitely not okay? It's a big one. There's a 600 to one chance that we're...

154
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:39,440
 That's really close. It's not... In trouble. Look, it's 20, when did I say it?

155
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:42,560
 It's only 20 years. 2040s. Well, I'll be gone, so.

156
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:48,480
 But it's not going to, it wouldn't wipe out the entire, it's one of those which is big enough

157
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:51,360
 that if it lands in the middle of Manhattan, it's going to cause a problem. Okay.

158
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:55,360
 If chances are it'll land in the ocean. If you were in the air in an airplane,

159
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:58,000
 do you think you'd be okay? If it hit your airplane, no.

160
00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:05,680
 Yeah. But I'm also thinking of your chances being in the air, the same of the three-hour delay

161
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:08,400
 that you would... Oh, yeah, you're probably going to be at the gate still.

162
00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:11,440
 Yeah. Thinking we'd like to be on board. We should be missing this.

163
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:17,040
 So there's this kind of thing where scientists are looking at all the different asteroids

164
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:23,760
 and there's 1,448 of them on their spreadsheet and there's something called the Torino scale

165
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:28,480
 which tells you how likely they are to hit the earth and this is the one that's most likely to

166
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:35,280
 hit the earth. It still, according to NASA, poses no unusual level of danger and the chance of

167
00:14:35,280 --> 00:14:41,920
 collision is extremely unlikely, that's what they say. Okay. But on this scale it is one on the scale

168
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:49,280
 and all the other 1,447 have a ranking of zero. Oh, okay. So everything is a zero apart from this

169
00:14:49,280 --> 00:14:54,400
 one which is a one. What does it go up to? If it goes up to two... It goes up to ten. Oh, it goes up to

170
00:14:54,400 --> 00:15:00,000
 ten. Fine, fine, fine, fine, fine, fine, fine, fine, fine. I feel fine. I'm still trying to work up

171
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:06,960
 titles for that tomato show. I've got like... On your own time, Andy, please. What, no, tomato...

172
00:15:06,960 --> 00:15:16,960
 It's not wet, is it? Yeah, yeah, yeah. Because we already know who's house it is. Yeah. Yeah, yeah.

173
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:25,840
 I'm so glad you interrupted with that. Here's a bit of exciting news.

174
00:15:25,840 --> 00:15:31,200
 Oh, shit, I can't stop thinking what the title will be now.

175
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:35,760
 It gets you, doesn't it? All right, let's try and move on. Can I tell you about a new invention this

176
00:15:35,760 --> 00:15:39,760
 year? Sure. Right after I say the thing I was about to say. Yeah. Oh, yeah, sorry about that.

177
00:15:39,760 --> 00:15:43,840
 Does the Trinidad indulge you, then, thinking you believe what you said was worthwhile? He actually

178
00:15:43,840 --> 00:15:49,920
 has something to report. Dan, you were safe. Well, just really quickly, another space

179
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:55,600
 science thing that we've discovered this year is what the speed would need to be miles per hour

180
00:15:55,600 --> 00:16:01,760
 for Elliot from the movie E.T. and his brother and his buddies to get the bicycles up to the

181
00:16:01,760 --> 00:16:08,720
 height that they need to get to go past the moon. The reason we know this is because it turns out

182
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:15,440
 that the composer, John Williams, has spent the last 40 years wanting to know that answer. No. Yeah.

183
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:20,080
 He said while he was conducting it, he saw the footage and he went, "How the fuck would they do

184
00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:24,960
 that?" And over the last 40 years, he's just constantly like in the shower just going, "Well,

185
00:16:24,960 --> 00:16:30,400
 how the fuck would they actually do that?" And finally, this year, he got given an honour by

186
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:33,600
 NASA. And while he was there, he said to an astronaut, "Listen, I've been thinking about

187
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:38,320
 this for 40 years. When you go up, like, what's the escape velocity that you need to break gravity?"

188
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:47,280
 And they said, "Basically, you need to go 17,500 miles an hour." And he went, "Ugh." And so it's

189
00:16:47,280 --> 00:16:52,400
 all sorted out from there. It doesn't seem like that. They must have slowed it down. Yeah. Because

190
00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:57,200
 what John Williams is missing is a bit of a big plot point, which is they had a magic alien in the

191
00:16:57,200 --> 00:17:03,200
 basket. Here's the weird thing. I suddenly realised that John Williams, when he's conducting to E.T.,

192
00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:07,440
 he does with the footage in there and he's conducting the orchestra to it with his baton,

193
00:17:07,440 --> 00:17:12,320
 right? But he also conducted the theme tune for Harry Potter. And that must have been so weird

194
00:17:12,320 --> 00:17:20,320
 when he's holding his magic wand stick going, "Bassoon!" And, you know, the really good conductors

195
00:17:20,320 --> 00:17:31,840
 don't shout the ins and outs. "Chalo!" It's a lifetime's training to stop yourself.

196
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:39,280
 If you listen very closely to the soundtracks, you hear John Williams. Trumbo!

197
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:45,680
 Can I give you a fruit and vegetable-related fact, scientific one from this year?

198
00:17:45,680 --> 00:17:52,320
 Yeah. Not tomato one. Have you heard of a new vegetable that has been invented this year called

199
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:58,960
 the garlic? Is that part garlic, part leek? Oh, I was hoping we'd have a bit more of a fun guess.

200
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:05,840
 No, just two members of the alien family.

201
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:17,440
 They spent ten years working on this. Not on the name. Not on the name. I rather think they might

202
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:26,160
 have come up with the name first. But it sounds great. It sounds quite good. Because I had a meal

203
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:31,120
 before we came out here and I made it with leek and garlic. Right. Imagine if I had a garlic.

204
00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:37,920
 Exactly. Imagine all the time I would say. Yeah. Actually, that would be nice to chop up bloody

205
00:18:37,920 --> 00:18:43,200
 garlic every time you eat. Right. They could merge all the ingredients that we had. They could do a

206
00:18:43,200 --> 00:19:02,160
 leek, come garlic, come onion, come carrot. Why do you want someone to come in there?

207
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:21,680
 How I like my dinner. Okay. It is time for fact number two and that is Anna. My fact this week is

208
00:19:21,680 --> 00:19:27,840
 that the heirs who inherited Silvio Berlusconi's properties had to deal with the 20 bunga bunga

209
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:36,880
 showgirls still living in them. That is amazing. This is just an odd conundrum to be faced with

210
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:43,920
 when your dad dies. Not a lot of people have to go through but he died in June and he has

211
00:19:43,920 --> 00:19:49,760
 got lots of houses and he lent 20 of them to various women along with sometimes a little monthly

212
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:54,640
 allowance and it was a little bit controversial as to why he lent these houses to them. He promised

213
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:59,360
 them that they would be able to take over ownership of them so apparently he said to one of these

214
00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:06,240
 women, Barbara Guerra, I promise you on my five children that I will let you own this house but

215
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:10,560
 he said I can't give you the right to ownership until all my trials are over so he's been having

216
00:20:10,560 --> 00:20:16,640
 lots of trials like many world leaders past and present because then I'll be accused kind of

217
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:22,080
 a bribery because the accusation was that these women were women who attended the bunga bunga

218
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:25,280
 parties. Does everyone remember the bunga bungas? I think we should say for young listeners what

219
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:33,760
 bunga bunga is. I mean not for the not young listeners. No not young younger. Andy's kids

220
00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:43,920
 podcast. The CBB bedtime story with Andy Murray. So these were parties that he quite famously had

221
00:20:43,920 --> 00:20:53,680
 about 10 years ago and they were basically mass orgies if you believe one account and they were

222
00:20:53,680 --> 00:20:59,200
 sophisticated gatherings if you believe another account but lots of world leaders sort of or lots

223
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:04,000
 of politicians and dignitaries from around the world attended them. They happened in his big

224
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:10,240
 mansion and there were lots of women there who were kind of showgirls who perhaps performed services

225
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:18,960
 for people who were paying for them. One tomato. That was always his excuse. I was trying to find

226
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:27,120
 the tomato. Yeah and the idea was bunga bunga might have been possibly the punch line of his

227
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:31,280
 favourite joke. Yes. I don't know if you know it. I don't know. Well I'm not going to say it now

228
00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:38,320
 because it's a bit racist. Oh okay. You can do a non-racist version I think. Go for it. I'll have

229
00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:43,200
 a go. So you've been you're with your mates you're with two of your mates and you've been kidnapped

230
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:48,080
 by an enemy and the enemy says it's from your country. Well it's every country you're from.

231
00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:51,120
 Whatever country you're from doesn't matter. You've been kidnapped by an enemy from another

232
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:56,160
 country. I think we've seen where the racist bait has been seamlessly excised. Good.

233
00:21:56,160 --> 00:22:02,640
 And the leader of the other country says okay I'm going to give you two choices. You can either

234
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:07,920
 have bunga bunga or you can have death and the first one says okay oh I don't want to die so I'm

235
00:22:07,920 --> 00:22:12,880
 going to choose bunga bunga and then the second one also chooses bunga bunga and turns out this

236
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:18,880
 means that they are tortured in a sexual manner and then killed anyway. So the third one thinks

237
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:23,600
 well I don't really fancy this bunga bunga so he just says I'm going to have death and so the

238
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:31,280
 leader of the country says well death you shall have but first a little bunga bunga. It's not a

239
00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:39,200
 terrible joke. Apparently you heard it from Gaddafi which is always the best. To be honest he did

240
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:46,640
 tell it much better than you did. I love the idea of you just taking a lot of racist comedian sets

241
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:52,720
 and reinterpreting that because I'm really upset that I can't enjoy a Jim Davidson set or a Bernard

242
00:22:52,720 --> 00:23:02,880
 Manning but Anna Tyshinski reimagines Bernard Manning. That's a good format. So anyway there are

243
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:07,840
 these women living in these houses and they are still there at the moment. I think they're in

244
00:23:07,840 --> 00:23:12,480
 the process of trying to evict them now and they don't want to go understandably because

245
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:18,400
 Berlusconi said to them these houses are yours but they also want Marta Faschina who was his last

246
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:24,080
 companion who was with him for the years before he died to leave the mansion where she used

247
00:23:24,080 --> 00:23:28,480
 been housed like his mansion where she's called Faschina. Yeah yeah she sounds like a female

248
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:32,480
 fascist doesn't she's got a lot of letters of the word fascist in her name and she is an MP

249
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:41,040
 for Forza Italia. Wow really. Which was his party. Which is the very right wing Italian party

250
00:23:41,040 --> 00:23:46,000
 so normative determinism. I only know one thing about sorry do you have more about her?

251
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:51,280
 Just that she was left a hundred million euros in his will Berlusconi was loaded. Yeah we know

252
00:23:51,280 --> 00:23:57,520
 this. Yeah we did know. Oh well. It was very corrupt. I think it was all got through oh no we can

253
00:23:57,520 --> 00:24:01,920
 say it now it's all right he's dead. Yeah although he was acquitted of everything in the end except

254
00:24:01,920 --> 00:24:06,320
 fraud so he was completely acquitted of paying underage people for sex and other such things.

255
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:11,200
 He did quite a lot of influence in the courts though and the judicial. I'm not saying I'm not

256
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:17,200
 saying money to you know. I'm just clearing it for the lawyers. Okay there are no lawyers.

257
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:23,840
 The only thing I know about him is that the water that he left in his be quiet he left an

258
00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:29,280
 amazing art collection he had 25,000 paintings which is and it turns out that almost all of them

259
00:24:29,280 --> 00:24:35,200
 were rubbish as in. Oh really. An actual Italian art critic had looked through the collection of 25,000

260
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:39,520
 pictures and said maybe six of these are worth anything and the rest and a lot of them he just

261
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:45,120
 bought on like you know those late night TV shows where it's yeah. Did he really? Yeah. Wow. He would

262
00:24:45,120 --> 00:24:50,240
 just watch and order those things. Wow. That's for a salad man. He kind of comes with a free

263
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:56,240
 salad mixer it was that kind of level of art. He's become art himself Bellisconi. Is he? Yeah so

264
00:24:56,240 --> 00:25:04,480
 there was an artist called Gianni Motti who supposedly this is alleged went to a lipo suction

265
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:11,040
 center he had fat taken out of him and this artist bought the fat from this center. No. He then

266
00:25:11,040 --> 00:25:17,520
 turned it into a bar of soap and so you could go to a museum and you could see a bar of Bellisconi

267
00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:23,360
 fat soap that was just sitting there and then the lipo suction center denied that they sold it to

268
00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:28,560
 this artist obviously because it became big news. Yeah yeah and the family denied it as well didn't

269
00:25:28,560 --> 00:25:34,160
 they but then the artist said okay I'll do a DNA test and they went we're gonna shut up now.

270
00:25:35,120 --> 00:25:39,040
 And they just kind of let it drop after that because I think they know it was him really. Yeah.

271
00:25:39,040 --> 00:25:44,240
 Guys knowing what we know about Bellisconi and his bunga bunga parties would you feel clean

272
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:51,200
 if you'd wash yourself with the Bellisconi fat soap? That's so interesting. I think you're dirtier

273
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:59,360
 if anything when you've done that. You can't wash away the stains of corruption. Very profound.

274
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:05,040
 I don't know if anyone could tell we're moving from interesting facts and comedy into profundities.

275
00:26:05,040 --> 00:26:12,320
 I've got a few things about other people who've died this year so Bellisconi died this year. One

276
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:19,280
 great Brit that we lost this year was of course Mystic Meg. Oh yeah. She was awesome I love Mystic

277
00:26:19,280 --> 00:26:23,760
 Meg. She was super famous back in the 90s where I wasn't living here but where she would go onto

278
00:26:23,760 --> 00:26:28,720
 the national lottery and she would predict that someone's won the lotto and the balls would be

279
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:33,680
 these. She'd never say the numbers though would she? No exactly. She would say the next one will

280
00:26:33,680 --> 00:26:37,920
 be 14. She'd say make sure to check your numbers if you haven't from the previous week and someone

281
00:26:37,920 --> 00:26:41,600
 did that and they found out that they won. So there were like these few occasions. But the thing

282
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:45,600
 about Mystic Meg was she was she used to be a journalist and she kind of fell into astrology

283
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:51,120
 and clairvoyance as part of a gig of being a newspaper editor and when she set up a hotline

284
00:26:51,120 --> 00:26:58,000
 for you to call up and get your predictions it was the number one hotline in the UK. Some places

285
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:02,560
 say globally it was so big that people just wanted to get these predictions. She was massive and

286
00:27:02,560 --> 00:27:07,120
 despite being as massive as she was there's virtually nothing that we really know about her

287
00:27:07,120 --> 00:27:11,520
 personal life that might change in the next few years but the two things I could find is one

288
00:27:11,520 --> 00:27:17,680
 someone who went to her house said that in every single room she had a naked photo of herself framed

289
00:27:17,680 --> 00:27:22,720
 and then the second one comes from her. It's one memory that she has from the time that she was

290
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:27,520
 doing the national lottery and this is a direct quote from her. She said my most vivid memory of

291
00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:32,000
 the lottery is when I was doing my prediction to camera and out of the corner of my eye I saw a

292
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:37,680
 naked man running towards me. The security guard caught him inches before he got in front of the

293
00:27:37,680 --> 00:27:47,200
 camera painted on his backs with the words pick my balls. The world's oldest dog died this year.

294
00:27:48,160 --> 00:27:58,000
 Bobby he was 31 years and 165 days which is 220 in human years. Yeah and there was someone at the

295
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:03,120
 Royal College of Veterinary Surgeons who said not a single one of my veterinary colleagues believes

296
00:28:03,120 --> 00:28:10,400
 Bobby was actually 31 years old but he was in the Guinness World Records but I think generally

297
00:28:10,400 --> 00:28:14,400
 speaking people don't think it was him. I mean quite a lot of the pictures of him have different

298
00:28:14,400 --> 00:28:22,640
 coloured paws. That's so funny. Hollywood actor Raquel Welsh died this year as well. She I can't

299
00:28:22,640 --> 00:28:26,160
 actually remember too much. She was in Bedazzled with Peter Cook and Dudley Moore. There was a

300
00:28:26,160 --> 00:28:31,680
 famous one like A Million Years BC or something yeah. I think she was the woman who had the

301
00:28:31,680 --> 00:28:37,600
 world record for kicking male co-stars in the genitals the most out of any actor.

302
00:28:37,600 --> 00:28:44,880
 Really within movies are on set. Just in life yeah no it was in movies I think from memory I

303
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:51,360
 think it was 21 times. Do you think she read scripts and decided based on that just rifling

304
00:28:51,360 --> 00:28:55,200
 through looking for the stage direction? Yeah it was probably in the claws of a contract.

305
00:28:55,200 --> 00:29:02,400
 Must knee balls at some point. Kind of my thing. Cos someone who I reckon did probably kick a few

306
00:29:02,400 --> 00:29:09,200
 co-actors in the balls was Glenda Jackson who also died this year. Did Glenda Jackson die?

307
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:15,520
 Yeah so sorry that you're discovering this now. And also sorry if anyone's just discovering about

308
00:29:15,520 --> 00:29:25,760
 Berlusconi as well. Mystic Meg you should have seen that coming. Glenda Jackson did die yes I'm sorry

309
00:29:25,760 --> 00:29:29,760
 to say but she was 86 but she was so great. I didn't know that much about Glenda Jackson. I

310
00:29:29,760 --> 00:29:34,880
 feel like she was from slightly before our time but she was so successful as an actress she got

311
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:41,840
 two Oscars three Emmys and a Tony Award so like the holy trinity of acting things. Then of course

312
00:29:41,840 --> 00:29:47,520
 she quitted all to join the Labour Party and become an MP. She had these two careers one after the other

313
00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:52,720
 both you know very effective very successful and mostly what people say is that she was absolutely

314
00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:58,320
 terrifying. Really? I read yeah yeah she was so this is why I feel like you know she wasn't kicking

315
00:29:58,320 --> 00:30:02,080
 people literally in the balls but some testicles were shriveling on set with her I think. There was

316
00:30:02,080 --> 00:30:07,280
 an interview with her in Vogue a few years ago where the interviewer said she was the most terrifying

317
00:30:07,280 --> 00:30:12,480
 person he'd ever interviewed greeting me with the level of warmth a non-animal lover reserves for

318
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:21,200
 next door's cat. Wow. And even Chris Bryant who's you know Chris Bryant the Labour MP he wrote her

319
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:26,640
 biography and she agreed to two interviews with him two four-hour long interviews and insisted

320
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:32,640
 during those interviews on sitting with her back to him the entire time. Wow. Maybe it's

321
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:37,360
 like you're telling you're sort of telling your story rather than telling Chris Bryant your story

322
00:30:37,360 --> 00:30:41,280
 you're sort of telling it almost to yourself. Yeah yeah yeah helps you be a bit more reflective.

323
00:30:41,280 --> 00:30:48,960
 Food for thought. No that one didn't fly. All right how about Dick Fosbury? No. The flopper.

324
00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:55,040
 Really he did? Inventor of the Fosbury flop he died this year. For the last time. Oh gosh. He invented

325
00:30:55,040 --> 00:31:03,280
 doing the high jump. Doing the high jump backwards and when he invented it the US Olympic track coach

326
00:31:03,280 --> 00:31:08,640
 said he will wipe out an entire generation of high jumpers because they will all have broken necks

327
00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:13,200
 so it was controversial at the time. There is a crash mat of course which does help you not break

328
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:17,200
 your neck. Yeah yeah yeah. The interesting thing was that had just been developed like a few years

329
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:21,840
 before he came along and that's why it was of its time because there was a woman called Debbie

330
00:31:21,840 --> 00:31:27,600
 Brill who did it around the same time but wasn't quite so successful and she did it in Canada and

331
00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:32,720
 it was known as the Brill Bend. Which I think is better though. Oh that's cool. But because Fosbury

332
00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:37,680
 won the Olympic gold medal that's why it was named after him. 40 years after he won the gold medal

333
00:31:37,680 --> 00:31:43,760
 in the Olympics there was a dinner in His Honour in London and Dorothy Tyler who was an 88-year-old

334
00:31:43,760 --> 00:31:49,440
 high jumper around the same time as him. As he was getting his speech she ran on to the stage

335
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:54,240
 well ran as much as an 88-year-old can. Went on to the stage grabbed the mic on him and said

336
00:31:54,240 --> 00:32:01,040
 you can't go over that bar head first. It's cheating. You're all cheats. Oh wow. It lasted 40 years after

337
00:32:01,040 --> 00:32:06,000
 he'd done it. That's what happened. That's incredible. She was the first British female athlete to win an

338
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:13,280
 individual Olympic medal in athletics and it was at the 1936 Olympics in Germany and she met

339
00:32:13,280 --> 00:32:19,680
 Adolf Hitler on that day and she later said he was an odious little man in a big uniform who I

340
00:32:19,680 --> 00:32:28,560
 probably should have slapped. That's beautiful. Cheering that good honour. Finally someone brings

341
00:32:28,560 --> 00:32:42,320
 that guy down a peg or two. Okay it is time for fact number three and that is James. Okay my fact

342
00:32:42,320 --> 00:32:48,640
 this week is that England footballer Ivan Tony who was suspended for gambling in May has the

343
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:58,400
 middle names Benjamin Elijah meaning his initials spell out I bet. So good. It's amazing. He bet on

344
00:32:58,400 --> 00:33:06,320
 126 games in competitions he was playing in and he bet 13 times on his own team to lose but he

345
00:33:06,320 --> 00:33:11,600
 wasn't playing in those games but they banned him for quite a few months and I think when this goes

346
00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:16,160
 out he will be just about to come back. So you're not I genuinely don't know anything about the

347
00:33:16,160 --> 00:33:19,520
 rules are you not allowed to bet on your team to lose even if you're not playing? You're actually

348
00:33:19,520 --> 00:33:24,000
 not allowed to bet on your sport at all. In your sport that's true in most spots. Yeah. Well because

349
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:27,680
 you've got so much inside info haven't you? Yeah I bet on podcasts all the time.

350
00:33:27,680 --> 00:33:35,840
 Am I going to get suspended? What's the bet? I bet this is going to give me a good episode.

351
00:33:38,080 --> 00:33:41,680
 Even by the loosest definition podcasting isn't a sport so I think you're all right.

352
00:33:41,680 --> 00:33:47,200
 I seem to remember that when I was living in Australia in in corner shops where they sold

353
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:52,000
 lottery tickets and if you worked at the corner shop you weren't allowed to do the lottery tickets

354
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:55,920
 and friends and family weren't allowed as well like the scratch cards and stuff. Really? Yeah but

355
00:33:55,920 --> 00:34:01,520
 of course the problem is with football it's entirely sponsored by gambling companies and so we're

356
00:34:01,520 --> 00:34:07,040
 expecting these young men to not gamble and at the same time they're wearing names of gambling

357
00:34:07,040 --> 00:34:11,520
 companies on their shirts and there being advertised them and stuff like that so it is a big problem

358
00:34:11,520 --> 00:34:17,600
 in football right now. It is and he was I don't I wouldn't say that we think of him as a villain

359
00:34:17,600 --> 00:34:21,120
 it's like he's a gambling addict right and he and I think it is an important distinction when

360
00:34:21,120 --> 00:34:26,320
 you hear he bet on games where his team lost is he Brentford? A time of recording yes but we expect

361
00:34:26,320 --> 00:34:30,720
 him to move in there. Okay but yeah he didn't throw the games or anything so it is just he was so

362
00:34:30,720 --> 00:34:36,000
 addicted to gambling that you know he couldn't help himself from doing it and it is made way too easy

363
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:40,960
 isn't it? I got this quick football thing which is slightly interesting. The World Cup, Qatar,

364
00:34:40,960 --> 00:34:47,200
 it was the first time in World Cup history that no British person as a fan was arrested.

365
00:34:47,200 --> 00:34:54,880
 Get away. This is according to Mark Roberts of Cheshire Police. What's happened to us as a country?

366
00:34:54,880 --> 00:35:02,240
 There's nothing sacred, so shameful. They don't know for sure they think because it's a dry country

367
00:35:02,240 --> 00:35:11,040
 that might have contributed to the situation. No arrests of Brits at the World Cup. Another

368
00:35:11,040 --> 00:35:18,000
 bit of World Cup history was actually made this year and that was by Bethany England. She became

369
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:24,080
 the first player to play for a country that shares her own name. That's good. That's the first time

370
00:35:24,080 --> 00:35:29,120
 ever? Yeah so there are people like Alan Brazil. I think there are people with the surnames of

371
00:35:29,120 --> 00:35:34,160
 countries that they don't play for. They exist but this is the first one. Sorry, Alan Brazil.

372
00:35:34,160 --> 00:35:43,840
 What? Is Alan Brazil really mega famous? Quite famous. Sorry, that's a funny name.

373
00:35:43,840 --> 00:35:48,320
 That's the least Brazilian name I've ever heard. Gavin Hong Kong.

374
00:35:48,320 --> 00:35:56,800
 What does he play football? He used to play football. They had a very, very, very long

375
00:35:56,800 --> 00:35:59,680
 football match played this year. I think the longest football match ever played.

376
00:35:59,680 --> 00:36:05,120
 It's weak as often the time of a football match is. Very specific, isn't it? Yeah.

377
00:36:05,120 --> 00:36:12,400
 Well this one lasted for 102 hours. Oh wow. That's too long. Did the ref forgot to blow the whistle?

378
00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:19,520
 No, it was a charity thing. It was in Southampton and it was 36 players but there had to be like 11

379
00:36:19,520 --> 00:36:25,040
 aside, standard match and they subbed in and out and you know they were exhausted but they kept

380
00:36:25,040 --> 00:36:29,200
 going. It doesn't count if you sub in and out. Well 102 hours is very, very long. Yeah with only

381
00:36:29,200 --> 00:36:35,200
 30 players, you can't sub out that much. No, you can't exactly. The final score was 910 to 725.

382
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:42,640
 At what stage? You know like if you're playing actual football. We can catch him, we can catch him.

383
00:36:42,640 --> 00:36:50,000
 But captain, he's discovered another 250 goals and there's only three hours left.

384
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:56,160
 That's like Roy of the Rovers shit. Oh my god. I got another football fact from the year but this

385
00:36:56,160 --> 00:37:08,080
 is American football, NFL. Soccer. As part of, no, no. Sorry? Hence the specific NFL reference.

386
00:37:08,080 --> 00:37:17,040
 American football, I'm with you. Yeah. So there's a Seattle venue, sorry, Seattle stadium called

387
00:37:17,040 --> 00:37:24,160
 Lumenfield and this year Taylor Swift as part of her Eras tour, she played it. What record did she

388
00:37:24,160 --> 00:37:31,040
 break at this tour? Okay, well she's dating an NFL player, Travis Kelsey right now. Yeah. So is it

389
00:37:31,040 --> 00:37:36,960
 something she, no, that would be disgusting. I don't know where you're going with that. So I don't

390
00:37:36,960 --> 00:37:46,160
 even, I don't even know where. Travis Kelsey is a tight end if that helps. Oh right. No, okay so the

391
00:37:46,160 --> 00:37:52,400
 previous record was set in 2011 with the Seahawks. What did she break this year? Seahawks. Biggest

392
00:37:52,400 --> 00:37:57,120
 attendance at an American football stadium. No. All right. I don't know anything about Taylor Swift.

393
00:37:57,120 --> 00:38:05,360
 Most lairy fan, drunkest fan. I thought, no, there was a thing where she did a gig that started a

394
00:38:05,360 --> 00:38:11,040
 sort of earth tremor. There we go. She has set the record for the largest magnitude earthquake

395
00:38:11,040 --> 00:38:20,560
 caused by fans at a gig or a match in this venue. So in 2011, the Seahawks fans registered 2.0

396
00:38:20,560 --> 00:38:26,240
 on the Richter scale and Taylor Swift fans from Jumping and Yelling and the music combined went

397
00:38:26,240 --> 00:38:33,840
 to 2.3. So she has the seismic activity record at Lumenfield in Seattle. That's great. It's very

398
00:38:33,840 --> 00:38:39,200
 impressive. Pretty cool. We talked about athletics earlier on. There was a race at the World University

399
00:38:39,200 --> 00:38:46,880
 Games where one of the Somali competitors finished more than 10 seconds behind the person who came

400
00:38:46,880 --> 00:38:53,360
 second last. And when you watch the video, everyone runs and they just sort of like, pretty much how

401
00:38:53,360 --> 00:38:58,000
 I would run. Like just sort of waddle their way down the track. And it's very clear that they

402
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:03,440
 shouldn't have been there. And as a result, a Somali sports official was suspended for abuse

403
00:39:03,440 --> 00:39:09,520
 of power, nepotism and defaming the name of the nation. But the amazing thing about this was

404
00:39:09,520 --> 00:39:15,760
 it was like such a good example of that escalated quickly because so they had this race and then

405
00:39:15,760 --> 00:39:21,840
 the Somali Minister of Youth said this person was clearly not a sports person nor a runner.

406
00:39:21,840 --> 00:39:29,280
 And then the Association of Somali Universities said, actually, we didn't send anyone to that event.

407
00:39:31,200 --> 00:39:36,480
 Plot twist. And then the Ministry of Youth and Sports said, as far as we know, there's no such

408
00:39:36,480 --> 00:39:47,200
 thing as the Somali University Sports Association. Oh, wow. How far does this go? Somalia doesn't

409
00:39:47,200 --> 00:39:54,080
 exist. Somalia doesn't exist. All right. I found out about a sport that happened this year, but that

410
00:39:54,080 --> 00:39:57,840
 I had never heard of before. It's just like had it standard annual thing this year. Have you guys

411
00:39:57,840 --> 00:40:06,000
 heard of competitive life saving? No. This is amazing. Wow. It's a real sport. Wait, wait,

412
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:12,880
 wait, wait. So the people who don't win, the people die? That's why it's not big. They just can't

413
00:40:12,880 --> 00:40:20,800
 get the volunteers. No, the Royal Life Saving Society holder happens every year or two, I think,

414
00:40:20,800 --> 00:40:25,680
 and it definitely happened this year. And they sort of stage incidents. So your team, you're in a

415
00:40:25,680 --> 00:40:30,800
 team that you go into a room which is either a dry room or it's a pool or a wet room or something.

416
00:40:30,800 --> 00:40:36,640
 Yeah, the dry room sounds easier for a start. And you have to react to whatever situation is

417
00:40:36,640 --> 00:40:41,360
 happening in there, work out what happened. And, you know, an incident has occurred. There is one,

418
00:40:41,360 --> 00:40:46,080
 there's the four man relay where your team have to drag each other through the water in a relay,

419
00:40:46,080 --> 00:40:50,560
 which sounds really fun. Wait, so you're dragging someone and then they hand me the

420
00:40:50,560 --> 00:40:54,560
 dragger over to you and I'm not dragged. They come to life and then you collapse and then they

421
00:40:54,560 --> 00:40:59,840
 have to... Yeah, I think that's it. Oh, you become the baton. This is really nice. Yes. That's the

422
00:40:59,840 --> 00:41:08,560
 most Zen relay team ever, is there? Just become the baton. Sorry, Andy, go on. No, no, no. I was just

423
00:41:08,560 --> 00:41:12,880
 looking up where the England team are from around the country and quite a lot of them are from Crawley.

424
00:41:12,880 --> 00:41:18,560
 Oh, nice. And of course the front crawl is the swimming stroke. Yes, it is, yes. Any from Breastley?

425
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:23,680
 No. Not that I saw. Not a place, I suppose.

426
00:41:23,680 --> 00:41:33,440
 Yeah. Can I just alert people who don't know to something amazing that happened in cricket this

427
00:41:33,440 --> 00:41:38,720
 year that I don't feel like got enough attention for its amazingness, which is, and I'm sure cricket

428
00:41:38,720 --> 00:41:43,360
 fans are probably aware that this had happened, but maybe not how rare it was. So there are 11 ways

429
00:41:43,360 --> 00:41:49,360
 of getting out an international cricket. And international cricket has been played since 1844,

430
00:41:49,360 --> 00:41:55,200
 which I actually didn't know. It was between the US and Canada in 1844. So a long time this year,

431
00:41:55,200 --> 00:42:02,480
 for the first time in all of that time, and in 240,000 innings, someone got out by the 11th way.

432
00:42:02,480 --> 00:42:09,120
 Wow. They've been saving it up for that long. Isn't that cool? Andy, what do you reckon it could be?

433
00:42:13,760 --> 00:42:19,680
 So you caught bold stumped. Yeah, that's it. Leg forewicket. Run out. Run out. Yeah, yeah. That's

434
00:42:19,680 --> 00:42:27,680
 fine. Unseen tomato on the ground. You slip on. Is it like a procedural that you rude to the umpire?

435
00:42:27,680 --> 00:42:31,840
 It's very similar. It's sort of about rudeness, yes. Okay. What's the one way of being rude that

436
00:42:31,840 --> 00:42:43,680
 you really hate? Letting your dog poo on the green. Is that it? Andy's cricket matches.

437
00:42:43,760 --> 00:42:51,200
 Bags of dog shit on the stumps. It's the other thing you hate. You do hate it when we have our

438
00:42:51,200 --> 00:42:56,240
 dog's shit before the podcast. But the other thing you hate. Oh, I mean, late. Lateness.

439
00:42:56,240 --> 00:43:02,080
 Exactly. Time out, yes. So people, basically there's an amount of time. It's two minutes,

440
00:43:02,080 --> 00:43:08,480
 isn't it? That you have to step up if you're going into bat. And there was Angelo Matthews,

441
00:43:08,480 --> 00:43:14,240
 who plays for Sri Lanka. And Sri Lanka were playing Bangladesh this year. And his chin strap was

442
00:43:14,240 --> 00:43:18,000
 broken. So it wasn't even really his fault, I don't think. I didn't see it like, but his chin strap

443
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:23,840
 was broken. So he was waiting for it to be fixed off for a new one to be delivered. And the bowler

444
00:43:23,840 --> 00:43:28,320
 appealed to the umpire to say, all right, two minutes is up. Usually you would just ignore it,

445
00:43:28,320 --> 00:43:34,160
 right? And like some people have taken longer than two minutes before and you would not appeal

446
00:43:34,160 --> 00:43:38,960
 because it's kind of a mean thing to do. And the umpire even said twice, are you sure you want

447
00:43:38,960 --> 00:43:43,200
 to, right, you want to get your opponent out this way like this? And the bowler was like, yeah,

448
00:43:43,200 --> 00:43:47,760
 don't care how I win as long as we win. And so the umpire had no choice. Had to say, yeah, you're

449
00:43:47,760 --> 00:43:53,680
 out. Wow, that's the 11th. That's never happened. Never happened in 240,000 innings. That's the first

450
00:43:53,680 --> 00:43:57,520
 time. Do you think that was in his head as he was walking off going, I can't believe that's what

451
00:43:57,520 --> 00:44:02,560
 I'm going to be remembered for. Yeah, entire career now. Yeah. Um, guys, just because we're

452
00:44:02,560 --> 00:44:06,480
 running late, I am going to have to move us on. Can I just do an initials fact really quickly,

453
00:44:06,480 --> 00:44:11,200
 because this was a fact by initials. One of my favorite stories of the year was the man who had

454
00:44:11,200 --> 00:44:16,480
 to apologize for carving his girlfriend's initials into the colosseum, saying that he'd had no idea

455
00:44:16,480 --> 00:44:24,480
 at the time that the building was particularly old. Fortunately, her name was IVX.

456
00:44:24,720 --> 00:44:38,640
 Um, okay, we need to move on to our final fact of the show. And that is my fact. My fact this week

457
00:44:38,640 --> 00:44:43,600
 is that this year we discovered that crocodiles are horny for helicopters.

458
00:44:43,600 --> 00:44:51,280
 So this is what happens, right? This isn't this was discovered in Korana crocodile farm in Queensland.

459
00:44:51,280 --> 00:44:56,000
 There's a path that goes over this field where Chinook helicopters Chinook helicopters are those

460
00:44:56,000 --> 00:45:01,200
 ones that have double rotors that really it's like a long sausage dog of a helicopter, which has

461
00:45:01,200 --> 00:45:06,480
 two sets of the rotors spinning around like that, right? So when that flies over, I don't think the

462
00:45:06,480 --> 00:45:14,320
 Royal Air Force would appreciate that characterization. Ferocious war machines. Is that the early old

463
00:45:14,320 --> 00:45:21,840
 sausage dog of the army? So these Chinook helicopters would fly over and in a few cases because

464
00:45:21,840 --> 00:45:25,920
 they're flying over an area where there's a lot of crocodiles. If they've got people on board that

465
00:45:25,920 --> 00:45:30,800
 they want to sort of show off the area to they might dip a bit low and fly closer and say look

466
00:45:30,800 --> 00:45:36,880
 at the crocs. And the the guy who owns this farm realized that when this happened, all of his

467
00:45:36,880 --> 00:45:42,480
 crocodiles got extremely horny and started mating and they out of season out of the time when they

468
00:45:42,480 --> 00:45:47,200
 usually would. And it's been a bit of a mystery as to why they're doing it. And so at the moment,

469
00:45:47,200 --> 00:45:54,880
 as it stands in 2023, we are on a theory level with it. There's a few ideas. They think it's

470
00:45:54,880 --> 00:46:00,000
 emulating either in its tone or changing the temperature of the water when the rotors are

471
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:05,520
 pushing down onto the water. They're emulating something that signifies an incoming storm.

472
00:46:05,520 --> 00:46:11,440
 And basically storms are like aphrodisiacs to crocodiles in Queensland because the areas will

473
00:46:11,440 --> 00:46:16,720
 flood and then the flooding would die down. And then six weeks later after you mated, the eggs

474
00:46:16,720 --> 00:46:21,520
 would be born in a much drier area. Always would take six weeks to go from mating to laying the

475
00:46:21,520 --> 00:46:25,600
 eggs. Yes, to laying the eggs. So when they when they feel a storm is coming, maybe when they hear

476
00:46:25,600 --> 00:46:31,600
 the noise of a storm coming, they're suddenly like it's it's sexy time. And they and they have sex

477
00:46:31,600 --> 00:46:36,880
 so that they can match it to the best circumstances for the eggs to survive is the theory. I read the

478
00:46:36,880 --> 00:46:40,560
 paper because there was a scientific paper about it wasn't there. And they said that that is the

479
00:46:40,560 --> 00:46:45,760
 most likely. The other option is it could be they think it's like the mating roar of rival males.

480
00:46:45,760 --> 00:46:51,600
 That was a clean you're female now. I think what Dan said is most likely they said that whatever it is

481
00:46:51,600 --> 00:46:54,960
 what makes them horny is the sonorous thump of the choppers.

482
00:46:54,960 --> 00:46:59,520
 We can all empathize with that. So there's no...

483
00:46:59,520 --> 00:47:05,200
 Isn't your wife a helicopter pilot?

484
00:47:05,760 --> 00:47:11,680
 That is the true fact.

485
00:47:11,680 --> 00:47:17,920
 There's no suggestion in the paper that they confuse it with a sausage dog and that's what makes them

486
00:47:17,920 --> 00:47:27,040
 horny. I just had another story about an animal, a funny animal story. And this was also about a

487
00:47:27,040 --> 00:47:32,880
 chap called Felix Popescu, who is a Romanian surgeon. And he's a Romanian surgeon who has a

488
00:47:32,880 --> 00:47:37,440
 holiday villa in the mountains and he was in the city and he got a call from the caretaker

489
00:47:37,440 --> 00:47:44,720
 of his holiday villa saying it had been raided by a bear and it cost 10,000 euros worth of damages.

490
00:47:44,720 --> 00:47:50,160
 But what Popescu was most furious about was that he drank all of his alcohol.

491
00:47:50,160 --> 00:47:53,840
 He was quoted as saying... And stole all of his Piccadik baskets.

492
00:47:53,840 --> 00:48:02,640
 Exactly. So he had a load of vodka there and they just drank all of it.

493
00:48:02,640 --> 00:48:08,720
 Vodka, whiskey, champagne. The man said the bear left him without any of them. He had a very good

494
00:48:08,720 --> 00:48:14,000
 time in my house. It sounds like he did. That's amazing. I think there's a kid's book in that,

495
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:18,080
 like the tiger who came to tea. Who came to get pissed.

496
00:48:18,080 --> 00:48:24,720
 I think you've lost a lot of the under 10s audience quite quickly. I've got another alcohol

497
00:48:24,720 --> 00:48:30,560
 fight actually. There's been a new beetle that's been discovered in South America and it has been

498
00:48:30,560 --> 00:48:38,400
 named after Kalsberg. It's the Longcovilius Kalsbergii beetle and the reason it's been called that is

499
00:48:38,400 --> 00:48:46,960
 because its penis looks like a bottle opener. Wow. Oh wow. Could in theory use it? Well,

500
00:48:46,960 --> 00:48:54,720
 the entire animal is only one centimetre long so it would have to be a very, very small bottle of

501
00:48:54,720 --> 00:49:00,720
 beer. Of beer, yeah. But yeah, I was reading the report about it and they said that genitalia are

502
00:49:00,720 --> 00:49:06,080
 the organs in insects that evolve to be different in every species. As such, they are often the

503
00:49:06,080 --> 00:49:12,640
 best way to identify a species. That's why entomologists like us are always quick to examine

504
00:49:12,640 --> 00:49:20,960
 insect genitalia. He protested too much. I'm going to have to wrap us up really

505
00:49:20,960 --> 00:49:26,000
 soon. I've got a little quiz question for you. Oh, good. Yeah. Vienna Zoo has stopped giving its

506
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:34,400
 animals what this year? Schnetzl. Very good. Schnetzl. Mozart. Yeah. Handjobs.

507
00:49:34,400 --> 00:49:43,280
 James said two scrupulously Viennese things. Schnetzl and Mozart. I obviously went to a different

508
00:49:43,280 --> 00:49:54,560
 bit of the city. It was a fun place. Is there anything related to Vienna? I bet Anna's closest.

509
00:49:54,560 --> 00:50:01,120
 No, it's one note. Is it type of food? It's no. It's something core to your sense of self.

510
00:50:01,120 --> 00:50:06,720
 Oh, names. Is this another mojave of fantasy? It's names. It's nominative non-determinism. It's the

511
00:50:06,720 --> 00:50:10,720
 oldest zoo in the world. It's called Schoenblum and they used to have loads of animals. You know,

512
00:50:10,720 --> 00:50:16,080
 they had Ricky the bear or Susie, the tiger, whatever. She came to tea, didn't she?

513
00:50:16,080 --> 00:50:21,840
 They've said it's too personalising. They said we should be representing whole species.

514
00:50:21,840 --> 00:50:27,200
 It's actually a bit of a false friend to say, oh, this is Anton the Ardvark. You're thinking

515
00:50:27,200 --> 00:50:32,640
 about Anton. You should be thinking about Ardvarks. You know what I mean? What kind of weird communist

516
00:50:32,640 --> 00:50:39,040
 zoo is this? I don't respect that. I think that makes sense. But then you miss out on things. I

517
00:50:39,040 --> 00:50:44,000
 read about a pig that ran away in New Jersey who was called Albert Einstein.

518
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:53,120
 And then you don't give him that name. Like, what's the new... Like, you know, the police officers

519
00:50:53,120 --> 00:50:59,440
 were able to say he was hard to catch because he's very clever, you know? I was reading another

520
00:50:59,440 --> 00:51:04,880
 kind of animal mating story. Oh, yeah. And this is another study that's been done this year. And

521
00:51:04,880 --> 00:51:09,040
 it's about elephant seals. You know, those things, they're absolutely huge. Huge creatures.

522
00:51:09,040 --> 00:51:13,040
 Well, actually, they're very differently sized between the sexes. So I think the males are

523
00:51:13,040 --> 00:51:17,120
 five times bigger than the females. So the males are massive. I know, it's a massive difference.

524
00:51:17,120 --> 00:51:19,280
 They're not very attractive, are they, elephant seals?

525
00:51:19,280 --> 00:51:27,840
 To us. Conventionally. Like, yeah. Like... They're quite hideous looking creatures. Go on, but let's all

526
00:51:27,840 --> 00:51:32,880
 picture them having sex, why don't we? Well, it's basically they indulge in a thing called

527
00:51:32,880 --> 00:51:39,120
 extreme polygyny, right? Now, this is where small numbers of large males, which are known as beach

528
00:51:39,120 --> 00:51:50,320
 masters... Is that self-designated? I think so. But once they can have harems of up to 100 females,

529
00:51:50,320 --> 00:51:53,440
 one male. And that means a lot of other males get cut out of the equation.

530
00:51:53,440 --> 00:51:58,720
 Although when a male gets to having a harem of 100 females, they might take on a younger

531
00:51:58,720 --> 00:52:04,720
 male as an apprentice beach master. That genuinely happens. And so only about 4% of males become

532
00:52:04,720 --> 00:52:10,800
 beach masters. That's when they can have sex? Yes. And they might have a smaller harem, you know,

533
00:52:10,800 --> 00:52:14,080
 but the beach masters are the very successful ones. So they're not beach master baiting until

534
00:52:14,080 --> 00:52:18,640
 they're allowed to get to the beach? Sometimes the steel jaws close and you realize you're in

535
00:52:18,640 --> 00:52:23,600
 a trap and you have no idea. Amazing. No, but so this is the thing, because being big is a sign

536
00:52:23,600 --> 00:52:28,240
 of success for them and it's sort of like a positive signal for them for mating, they compete

537
00:52:28,240 --> 00:52:33,040
 very fiercely to gain weight with other male elephant seals and they forage at sea in areas

538
00:52:33,040 --> 00:52:37,440
 which are really dangerous because those are the bits which have a bit more food in, but they also

539
00:52:37,440 --> 00:52:42,960
 might contain sharks or killer whales, both of which love to eat elephant seals. And it seems

540
00:52:42,960 --> 00:52:47,600
 like the male survival rates drop rapidly after they're about eight years of age,

541
00:52:47,600 --> 00:52:52,080
 which is when they're sort of looking for mating. So in a very, very rare example of something in

542
00:52:52,080 --> 00:52:57,200
 the animal kingdom not doing well, not because of human interaction or interference, it's basically

543
00:52:57,200 --> 00:53:00,720
 they're dying solely because they think it'll increase their odds of mating. Because they think

544
00:53:00,720 --> 00:53:05,360
 the bigger the better. So they just do absolutely anything they can, they go anywhere for the most

545
00:53:05,360 --> 00:53:10,080
 dangerous place in the world for them to get some more food. Stuff their faces. Yeah. I don't know

546
00:53:10,080 --> 00:53:14,560
 if bigger is sexier in elephant seal communities, I know we've established I don't find them attractive,

547
00:53:14,560 --> 00:53:20,080
 but if a male is five times bigger than you, I probably wouldn't fancy someone who was 25 foot

548
00:53:20,080 --> 00:53:26,160
 tall. I think there is that in humans, like just what is it called? It's called soup, I forgot

549
00:53:26,160 --> 00:53:30,800
 what it's called now. But it's the fact that animals sometimes the one thing they find attractive,

550
00:53:30,800 --> 00:53:35,120
 if you make it a million times more, then they do find it way more attractive. Supernatural

551
00:53:35,120 --> 00:53:40,400
 selection. Something like that. Yeah. It's the it's the like a goose likes an egg, but if you give

552
00:53:40,400 --> 00:53:48,000
 it a volleyball, it loves it. Yeah. And the idea being like sometimes if you see like a a model

553
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:53,360
 with enormous fake breasts, then humans think that that's attractive, even though it's unnatural.

554
00:53:53,360 --> 00:53:58,320
 Right. Okay. So yeah. Supernatural selection sounds like falling in love with a ghost.

555
00:53:58,320 --> 00:54:04,720
 Yeah. Yes. And that's why natural selection is not going to be kind to you in the long time.

556
00:54:04,720 --> 00:54:16,400
 We do need to wrap up very, very soon. Yeah. Anna, you feel like you want to say one more thing?

557
00:54:16,400 --> 00:54:20,640
 I felt like you looked at your paper. Oh, I glanced down. I was just going to rant actually about

558
00:54:20,640 --> 00:54:25,600
 another animal naming thing which is that they're renaming all of American birds next year. Sorry,

559
00:54:25,600 --> 00:54:30,960
 all of American birds that are named after people. So the American ornithological society has decided

560
00:54:30,960 --> 00:54:36,960
 to change the name of all bird species named after people as of next year, because a lot of the ones

561
00:54:36,960 --> 00:54:40,960
 named after people, they're quite controversial people. Were they racist? Were they not? It's

562
00:54:40,960 --> 00:54:45,840
 quite a lot of effort finding out whether all of them were or not. So why not just rename everything?

563
00:54:45,840 --> 00:54:50,400
 And I was all pro this. I thought it sounded like a really good idea until I realized, of course,

564
00:54:50,400 --> 00:54:55,360
 the Anna's hummingbird. Oh. Yeah, but you did tell that Bunker Bunker joke earlier.

565
00:54:55,360 --> 00:55:14,480
 Okay, that is it. That is all of our facts. Thank you so much for listening. If you would like to
