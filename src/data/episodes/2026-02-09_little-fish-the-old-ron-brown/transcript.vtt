00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:14.000
 [music]

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:15.000
 Hey everyone!

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.600
 Welcome to another episode of Little Fish.

00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:22.040
 This is the show where we put down our favorite facts from the last seven days and we go

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:25.640
 through the podcast@QI.com inbox.

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:29.480
 We pick out the best facts that you have all found and we're going to read them out now.

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:32.100
 I'm sitting here with James Harkin and Drew Hunter Murray.

00:00:32.100 --> 00:00:34.100
 Guys, let's do it, who's got a fact?

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:35.100
 I've got one.

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:36.100
 This is a great one.

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:38.580
 It's from James Patterson and it's that.

00:00:38.580 --> 00:00:39.580
 The author?

00:00:39.580 --> 00:00:40.580
 No.

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:41.580
 Up to you now.

00:00:41.580 --> 00:00:42.580
 It spells slightly differently.

00:00:42.580 --> 00:00:43.580
 Oh.

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:47.580
 I've got another for everything.

00:00:47.580 --> 00:00:52.920
 James Patterson, all James Patterson using an incredibly unimaginative non-duplube.

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:58.640
 The fact is that during the Cold War, a KGB agent had several meetings with Edinburgh

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:03.080
 for a Leith MP and communist sympathiser, Ron Brown.

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:08.120
 However, they were unsure if he was spying for them or not because they couldn't understand

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:12.280
 his thick Scottish accent and had no idea what he was telling them.

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:13.280
 [laughter]

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:14.280
 That's incredible.

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:15.280
 It's true.

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:17.720
 This is you do some reading on that, is that true?

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:18.720
 A little bit.

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:25.120
 It's from the Ben McIntyre book about Oleg Gordievsky, who was, I think, a double agent on various

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:26.620
 sides.

00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:30.700
 The quote was, "Brown may have been leaking top grade secrets, but equally, you might have

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:31.700
 been talking about football."

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:32.700
 They just couldn't tell.

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:33.700
 They just couldn't tell.

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:34.700
 Amazing.

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:37.900
 Can I just say, my wife is Russian, as has been mentioned a few times on the show, and she

00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:40.420
 actually found the Scottish accent the easiest to understand.

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:41.420
 That's so interesting.

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:42.580
 I don't know why.

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:45.660
 When you learn another language, it's kind of, you can understand it usually, but when people

00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:47.420
 talk over each other, that's when it's tricky.

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:48.420
 That's what she can do.

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:49.420
 It's the cadence.

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:54.320
 I mean, because there are Scottish accents and Scottish accents, you can get some really,

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:55.320
 really hot.

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:57.640
 Obviously, Edinburgh is a relatively soft accent.

00:01:57.640 --> 00:01:58.640
 Yeah.

00:01:58.640 --> 00:01:59.640
 It is absolutely.

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:02.160
 Let's go as often said to be the harder of the two to forget.

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:03.160
 Yeah.

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:04.400
 I don't know where Ron Brown was from.

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:08.360
 I mean, he was the MP for that, but he was apparently a colourful character.

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:12.680
 He was a labour MP who damaged the parliamentary mace in a row over the poltax and ended up in

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:15.600
 court for stealing his mistresses' underwear.

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:16.600
 Wow.

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:17.600
 Yeah.

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:18.840
 That's very cool.

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:21.480
 I have another political one.

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:23.040
 Should we jump to that very quickly?

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:28.120
 So this is sent into us by Brady Steeper, and it's to do with Canada's longest-serving

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:31.080
 Prime Minister, who is called William King.

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:34.520
 So he says it's important to know, before hearing this fact, that he guided the country through

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:38.840
 the Great Depression, the Second World War, established Canadian citizenship, and successfully

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:43.120
 challenged the power of the crown, and the guy who he was challenging it against was called

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:49.640
 Lord Bing in a delightfully-named constitutional crisis called the King Bing Affair, or the King

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:50.640
 Bing Wingding.

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:51.640
 Yes.

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:54.880
 I presume they were just wasting, but at some point had to have a wingding.

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:55.880
 Yeah.

00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:59.880
 I've never heard the phrase "wingding" used outside of fonts.

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:00.880
 Oh, yeah.

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:02.280
 I didn't know it was a thing.

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:03.280
 A wingding was a thing.

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:04.280
 Love it.

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:06.120
 No, I don't think I did either.

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:07.120
 No.

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:08.120
 I think you say, "Oh, we had a wingding."

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:09.120
 I've heard that.

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:10.920
 No, I've heard we had a ding dong.

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:21.520
 That was the Prime Minister of China, Mr. Ding, and the Vietnamese currency, the dog.

00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:24.240
 Don't dig, don't dig, don't.

00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:31.760
 Anyway, the fact that Brady wanted to send to us is that on his death, King donated his

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:36.480
 estate to the Canadian government, and that included all of his diaries, 172 volumes.

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:37.480
 Wow.

00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:44.000
 And when they were read, they revealed that he made huge use of sails during his term as

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:45.280
 Prime Minister.

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:48.880
 So while he was Prime Minister, he was consulting with his dead mother.

00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:54.080
 He was consulting with a former dead prime minister, so Wilfred Lawrear, and his dog,

00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:55.080
 Pat.

00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:56.560
 He would talk to his dog, Pat.

00:03:56.560 --> 00:03:58.680
 I think he stands up in Parliament.

00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:04.680
 I think we need more biscuits.

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:20.040
 And one of the things to say, "Woo!"

00:04:20.040 --> 00:04:28.560
 Yeah, but I mean, apparently he spoke to Pat about the importance of the involvement that Canada had in the Second World War, conscription into the army.

00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:34.920
 And he would use either his dead mother or a former Prime Minister as a sort of soundboard.

00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:37.120
 Can you choose who you get to win a sails?

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:38.120
 I don't really know much about that.

00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:39.120
 You can try and request.

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:44.080
 I think that's largely people go, and they hope that someone that's on their mind will show up.

00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:48.600
 No, but if you've got a particular previous Prime Minister, can you say, I'd rather have someone from the other party, actually.

00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:50.600
 Or can you say, like, is Genghis Khan available?

00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:52.120
 We're in the middle of a total war.

00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:53.600
 I'm sure you could.

00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:54.600
 Yeah, I'm sure you could.

00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:56.360
 It depends on how pliable your medium is, I guess.

00:04:56.360 --> 00:04:57.360
 Yeah, exactly.

00:04:57.360 --> 00:04:58.360
 Yeah.

00:04:58.360 --> 00:05:02.320
 And the news about the Canadian Prime Minister, was he in Davos?

00:05:02.320 --> 00:05:03.320
 Can't he?

00:05:03.320 --> 00:05:05.320
 Yeah, he stole some sandwiches.

00:05:05.320 --> 00:05:07.560
 It was the Mark Carnie, Sally Barney.

00:05:07.560 --> 00:05:08.560
 Oh, my God.

00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:11.560
 I was wondering why you hadn't said anything for the last minute.

00:05:11.560 --> 00:05:14.560
 [laughter]

00:05:14.560 --> 00:05:17.200
 I can't believe you let me go through a whole sails chat.

00:05:17.200 --> 00:05:19.200
 I'm sorry, I wasn't listening to any of that.

00:05:19.200 --> 00:05:24.240
 You're going to be shocked when you hear what happened while you were gone into your pun temple.

00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:32.440
 OK, here is a fact from Sasha M and Sasha says, well, Sasha sends us what they call an almost

00:05:32.440 --> 00:05:35.960
 perfect sentence with no further context.

00:05:35.960 --> 00:05:38.240
 This is from Harper's magazine.

00:05:38.240 --> 00:05:44.960
 And the sentence goes, South African tafonomists found that pigs decompose more slowly when they

00:05:44.960 --> 00:05:51.040
 are wearing winter garments, and more quickly when they are eaten by the Cape Grey Mungoos.

00:05:51.040 --> 00:05:53.920
 Yes, I sort of would have expected that last bit.

00:05:53.920 --> 00:05:55.120
 I guess.

00:05:55.120 --> 00:05:58.120
 [laughter]

00:05:58.120 --> 00:05:59.120
 It's a brilliant sentence.

00:05:59.120 --> 00:06:00.120
 I love it.

00:06:00.120 --> 00:06:01.120
 Yeah.

00:06:01.120 --> 00:06:02.120
 Absolutely fantastic.

00:06:02.120 --> 00:06:03.120
 What garments as well?

00:06:03.120 --> 00:06:09.640
 Yeah, well, what they do is they use pigs decomposing to analogize to humans like you.

00:06:09.640 --> 00:06:12.560
 If you want to do an experiment, see how humans are going to decompose.

00:06:12.560 --> 00:06:14.440
 You can't get a human and do it, right?

00:06:14.440 --> 00:06:15.440
 Right, right.

00:06:15.440 --> 00:06:16.440
 But you can't get a pig.

00:06:16.440 --> 00:06:18.640
 There might be one left over from an abattoir or something.

00:06:18.640 --> 00:06:19.640
 Yeah.

00:06:19.640 --> 00:06:20.640
 And so that's why they do it.

00:06:20.640 --> 00:06:26.160
 Or they put them in garments to see how the pig decomposes, in case someone has been,

00:06:26.160 --> 00:06:29.640
 like let's say you find a body in the top of the mountain.

00:06:29.640 --> 00:06:31.800
 And it's at a certain level of decomposition.

00:06:31.800 --> 00:06:33.120
 You compare it with the pig.

00:06:33.120 --> 00:06:36.800
 No, but I'm just imagining the process is getting the winter garments, like having to drag

00:06:36.800 --> 00:06:38.720
 a dead pig into a branch of North Face.

00:06:38.720 --> 00:06:39.720
 Yeah.

00:06:39.720 --> 00:06:40.720
 Yeah.

00:06:40.720 --> 00:06:43.880
 We need something a little bit bigger in the waste of afraid the only.

00:06:43.880 --> 00:06:44.880
 [laughter]

00:06:44.880 --> 00:06:45.880
 Wow.

00:06:45.880 --> 00:06:46.880
 Wow.

00:06:46.880 --> 00:06:47.880
 That's a great sentence.

00:06:47.880 --> 00:06:48.880
 Yeah, lovely.

00:06:48.880 --> 00:06:54.880
 And a brilliant study, this was from quite a few years ago now, about 20 or 30 years ago,

00:06:54.880 --> 00:07:00.880
 but they put three tons of dead pigs in the middle of a forest in America.

00:07:00.880 --> 00:07:04.520
 And again, they wanted to see how, what would happen when it decomposed.

00:07:04.520 --> 00:07:05.800
 And this one was slightly different.

00:07:05.800 --> 00:07:09.600
 They wanted to see if there was a big die off of any animal.

00:07:09.600 --> 00:07:11.160
 How it would affect the ecosystem.

00:07:11.160 --> 00:07:12.160
 Interesting.

00:07:12.160 --> 00:07:15.520
 So they put these dead pigs in the middle of the forest.

00:07:15.520 --> 00:07:20.080
 They looked at first the vultures came and then the maggots and then the flies and all that

00:07:20.080 --> 00:07:21.360
 kind of stuff.

00:07:21.360 --> 00:07:27.840
 And basically, what they found is it gets really nasty, really quite quickly.

00:07:27.840 --> 00:07:32.920
 And not only did it get really nasty and there was dead pig everywhere, it was all rotten,

00:07:32.920 --> 00:07:37.760
 actually the area never really recovered, and it still hasn't really recovered.

00:07:37.760 --> 00:07:42.600
 And they're still studying it today because it's not back to how it was when they did the

00:07:42.600 --> 00:07:43.600
 study.

00:07:43.600 --> 00:07:44.600
 Gosh.

00:07:44.600 --> 00:07:45.600
 So yeah, that's wild.

00:07:45.600 --> 00:07:46.600
 That is wild.

00:07:46.600 --> 00:07:50.200
 Again, it's just scientists, you know, you need to know this stuff.

00:07:50.200 --> 00:07:51.200
 Absolutely.

00:07:51.200 --> 00:07:52.200
 You don't know when it's going to be useful in the future.

00:07:52.200 --> 00:07:53.200
 Absolutely.

00:07:53.200 --> 00:07:54.200
 Yeah.

00:07:54.200 --> 00:07:55.200
 Andy, you.

00:07:55.200 --> 00:07:56.200
 Let's get a fact.

00:07:56.200 --> 00:07:57.200
 This is you.

00:07:57.200 --> 00:08:02.000
 This is a fact from Nicholas Wilkinson, who begins unpromising.

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:07.440
 It's maybe not exactly a fact, but you know the pangolin, yeah, okay.

00:08:07.440 --> 00:08:09.280
 It's a strange, scaly creature, isn't it?

00:08:09.280 --> 00:08:10.280
 It's quite hardsheld.

00:08:10.280 --> 00:08:11.280
 Hardsheld.

00:08:11.280 --> 00:08:12.280
 Yeah.

00:08:12.280 --> 00:08:19.120
 It looks a bit like an armadillo, lovely long claws, traditional Chinese medicine, get

00:08:19.120 --> 00:08:20.280
 through a fair few.

00:08:20.280 --> 00:08:22.080
 I think they've just been removed from the official.

00:08:22.080 --> 00:08:24.880
 I think they're the most trafficked animal in the world.

00:08:24.880 --> 00:08:26.480
 Well, I'm glad you say that.

00:08:26.480 --> 00:08:27.480
 I'm not glad you say that.

00:08:27.480 --> 00:08:30.680
 I'm incredibly sad to say that because they're lovely.

00:08:30.680 --> 00:08:31.680
 Sorry.

00:08:31.680 --> 00:08:33.880
 I've got.

00:08:33.880 --> 00:08:38.200
 So you know the thing of more sharks, many, many more sharks are killed by people than

00:08:38.200 --> 00:08:39.680
 people are killed by sharks.

00:08:39.680 --> 00:08:40.680
 Yeah.

00:08:40.680 --> 00:08:44.880
 So Nicholas writes, this is similar because of the trade in pangolin products.

00:08:44.880 --> 00:08:50.440
 About a million pangolins are very sadly killed by humans each year, obviously horrendous.

00:08:50.440 --> 00:08:57.280
 The total of humans killed by pangolins is one, okay.

00:08:57.280 --> 00:08:58.600
 So they have no teeth.

00:08:58.600 --> 00:08:59.600
 They're slow moving.

00:08:59.600 --> 00:09:02.240
 They have poor eyesight and they're about the size of a cat, okay.

00:09:02.240 --> 00:09:07.440
 So it's an amazing story is from the book Mammals of Thailand, right?

00:09:07.440 --> 00:09:12.080
 In Threaten, the pangolin will wrap its tail completely around itself, turning itself

00:09:12.080 --> 00:09:13.680
 into a ball, basically.

00:09:13.680 --> 00:09:18.120
 So it's almost impossible to unfold, like an armadillo or a hedgehog, whatever.

00:09:18.120 --> 00:09:22.800
 But this is related by a naturalist called WWA Phillips, a villager, clubbed a pangolin

00:09:22.800 --> 00:09:25.480
 one day in the jungle and started back for his village.

00:09:25.480 --> 00:09:29.240
 The pangolin slung over his neck, the tail hanging down on one side, the head on the

00:09:29.240 --> 00:09:30.240
 other.

00:09:30.240 --> 00:09:33.720
 But the pangolin was merely stunned.

00:09:33.720 --> 00:09:37.360
 When found later, the man was dead on the trail, strangled, because the pangolin

00:09:37.360 --> 00:09:41.160
 had suddenly come too and then thought, "Coyle up, defensive."

00:09:41.160 --> 00:09:42.160
 Pangolin's strangling.

00:09:42.160 --> 00:09:43.160
 Oh my God.

00:09:43.160 --> 00:09:46.760
 If only there was a head of state that arrived with that.

00:09:46.760 --> 00:09:51.200
 If you could think of a head of state, if you rise with pangolin or strangling, podcast

00:09:51.200 --> 00:09:52.200
 at gui.com.

00:09:52.200 --> 00:09:53.200
 Yeah.

00:09:53.200 --> 00:09:57.520
 And it was still curled around his neck when the guy was found proving he'd been the victim

00:09:57.520 --> 00:09:59.800
 of a scaly mugging, you go?

00:09:59.800 --> 00:10:00.800
 Yeah.

00:10:00.800 --> 00:10:01.800
 Really good.

00:10:01.800 --> 00:10:02.800
 Amazing.

00:10:02.800 --> 00:10:03.800
 Very interesting.

00:10:03.800 --> 00:10:04.800
 What story?

00:10:04.800 --> 00:10:12.040
 In the world of animals, jelke, ludalfilge, apologies for the pronunciation there.

00:10:12.040 --> 00:10:15.280
 No, no, it's ludalfilge.

00:10:15.280 --> 00:10:23.080
 It's very rare to hear you nail at the first time, but jelke, J-E-L-K-E.

00:10:23.080 --> 00:10:24.080
 Jelke, probably.

00:10:24.080 --> 00:10:29.480
 But that was exactly how you speak when you're doing the impression of the Nobel committee.

00:10:29.480 --> 00:10:30.480
 Sorry.

00:10:30.480 --> 00:10:33.520
 Jelke or Jelke.

00:10:33.520 --> 00:10:38.640
 But it's a great fact, you've sent in, which is when biologists catch lizards during fieldwork,

00:10:38.640 --> 00:10:43.560
 they use a loop of dental floss with which they lasso the lizard.

00:10:43.560 --> 00:10:49.000
 This makes sure that the lizard remains unharmed and can be later released again without injury.

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:53.680
 The lasso is, of course, known as a lizzu.

00:10:53.680 --> 00:10:55.800
 So a little dental floss lasso for lizards.

00:10:55.800 --> 00:10:57.360
 That's really quite sweet.

00:10:57.360 --> 00:10:58.360
 It is quite sweet.

00:10:58.360 --> 00:10:59.360
 Yeah.

00:10:59.360 --> 00:11:00.360
 I love it.

00:11:00.360 --> 00:11:06.400
 This is a fact from Sam Walker, which Sam describes as a little fun fact, but let's see what you

00:11:06.400 --> 00:11:07.400
 think.

00:11:07.400 --> 00:11:15.920
 Sam says that the average ejaculate contains approximately 220,000 terabytes of data.

00:11:15.920 --> 00:11:16.920
 Terabytes?

00:11:16.920 --> 00:11:17.920
 Yes.

00:11:17.920 --> 00:11:18.920
 Terabytes.

00:11:18.920 --> 00:11:19.920
 That's massive, isn't it?

00:11:19.920 --> 00:11:20.920
 Like, one terabyte is very big.

00:11:20.920 --> 00:11:22.920
 It's more than I've got on my computer.

00:11:22.920 --> 00:11:23.920
 Oh, dear.

00:11:23.920 --> 00:11:25.920
 You can't get clot.

00:11:25.920 --> 00:11:26.920
 You can get special clots.

00:11:26.920 --> 00:11:31.240
 Why one of the lights, and that'll show you where you need to devote most intensive attention

00:11:31.240 --> 00:11:32.240
 to.

00:11:32.240 --> 00:11:33.240
 Oh, dear.

00:11:33.240 --> 00:11:40.680
 You know when you walk straight into your own trap.

00:11:40.680 --> 00:11:44.560
 You could almost physically hear the funk as your head hit.

00:11:44.560 --> 00:11:45.560
 Oh.

00:11:45.560 --> 00:11:50.560
 A prophesied showbub and the rex, wasn't it?

00:11:50.560 --> 00:11:51.560
 Wow.

00:11:51.560 --> 00:11:59.960
 But yeah, this is because each sperm contains around 37.5 megabytes of DNA data, which is basically

00:11:59.960 --> 00:12:03.080
 your genome is in every, okay.

00:12:03.080 --> 00:12:07.120
 And there's a lot of sperms in an ejaculate.

00:12:07.120 --> 00:12:12.920
 But I think if you were to put it in a zip file, if you were to compress it, because actually

00:12:12.920 --> 00:12:15.400
 all the data is kind of very similar.

00:12:15.400 --> 00:12:20.120
 If it's gone into a zip, something's gone wrong.

00:12:20.120 --> 00:12:26.520
 What I'm saying, like there's a fact that says that the amount of data is the same as the

00:12:26.520 --> 00:12:33.160
 entirety of English Wikipedia, approximately 40,000 times that amount of data.

00:12:33.160 --> 00:12:35.840
 But the truth is that all that data is almost the same.

00:12:35.840 --> 00:12:39.080
 So if you were to put it into your computer, you can compress it.

00:12:39.080 --> 00:12:41.520
 And actually, I think it would be much, much smaller than that.

00:12:41.520 --> 00:12:42.520
 Okay.

00:12:42.520 --> 00:12:47.720
 Because it's like, the thing is about data is you can have like Mary has a little lamb

00:12:47.720 --> 00:12:48.720
 written down.

00:12:48.720 --> 00:12:51.760
 But you could do the same thing 200 million times.

00:12:51.760 --> 00:12:53.680
 But is there really any more data there?

00:12:53.680 --> 00:12:55.920
 Or is it the same amount of data just replicated?

00:12:55.920 --> 00:13:00.280
 So there's a lot of, hmm, just a receptionist at the sperm, please go.

00:13:00.280 --> 00:13:01.280
 Thank you, Mr. Harkin.

00:13:01.280 --> 00:13:03.160
 But actually, we just need you to put the sample.

00:13:03.160 --> 00:13:04.160
 Thank you.

00:13:04.160 --> 00:13:09.960
 But I will pass that on to, I'm writing it down zip file, I've got to hear.

00:13:09.960 --> 00:13:12.320
 And you're going to need to give that a wife.

00:13:12.320 --> 00:13:23.800
 This is a very breast one from Kenneth Bowman or Bowman.

00:13:23.800 --> 00:13:25.600
 Hopefully this is suitable for little fish.

00:13:25.600 --> 00:13:29.120
 I work for a competitor of Chevrolet, so this one stings a bit.

00:13:29.120 --> 00:13:34.360
 The Chevrolet Suburban is the longest-produced automobile model or name plate still in production

00:13:34.360 --> 00:13:35.360
 today.

00:13:35.360 --> 00:13:37.440
 It was introduced in 1934.

00:13:37.440 --> 00:13:38.440
 Wow.

00:13:38.440 --> 00:13:41.880
 They've been making Chevrolet Suburban since 1934.

00:13:41.880 --> 00:13:42.880
 Weird.

00:13:42.880 --> 00:13:48.080
 I can't picture anything, but I can't imagine what a Chevy is.

00:13:48.080 --> 00:13:50.720
 It's a, it's a, it's a, it's a really quite big American car.

00:13:50.720 --> 00:13:51.720
 Is it?

00:13:51.720 --> 00:13:54.080
 I know I'm sure they get much bigger, but it is on its 12th generation.

00:13:54.080 --> 00:13:57.120
 Like, if you look at the first generation model, it does look different to the modern.

00:13:57.120 --> 00:13:58.120
 Really?

00:13:58.120 --> 00:13:59.120
 Yeah.

00:13:59.120 --> 00:14:00.120
 Of course.

00:14:00.120 --> 00:14:01.120
 Yeah.

00:14:01.120 --> 00:14:02.360
 Like Dr. Who is just exactly, exactly.

00:14:02.360 --> 00:14:03.360
 Yeah.

00:14:03.360 --> 00:14:04.520
 Also on roughly the 12th generation model.

00:14:04.520 --> 00:14:06.520
 That's what it, when, yeah, I can't remember, actually.

00:14:06.520 --> 00:14:07.520
 Yeah.

00:14:07.520 --> 00:14:09.520
 A wretching in the armor for you, then.

00:14:09.520 --> 00:14:15.240
 Are we counting the audio books?

00:14:15.240 --> 00:14:16.240
 That's amazing.

00:14:16.240 --> 00:14:17.240
 Yeah, it's good, isn't it?

00:14:17.240 --> 00:14:19.840
 Is there any other ones that are kind of similar?

00:14:19.840 --> 00:14:20.840
 I can't imagine.

00:14:20.840 --> 00:14:21.840
 I think the Ford Fiesta.

00:14:21.840 --> 00:14:25.720
 I think Ford Fiesta, that's the one that was in my, that's interesting, isn't it?

00:14:25.720 --> 00:14:27.720
 It's like when you say "Think of a Car", means like "Asus Bates".

00:14:27.720 --> 00:14:30.240
 If you ask a British person to name a car, they'll probably say "Fold Fiesta".

00:14:30.240 --> 00:14:31.240
 I think so.

00:14:31.240 --> 00:14:35.400
 But wasn't like some of the early Volkswagen's, didn't they date back to World War II?

00:14:35.400 --> 00:14:36.400
 I don't know.

00:14:36.400 --> 00:14:39.440
 Yes, they probably had a bit of a clear out of the Volkswagen's, didn't they?

00:14:39.440 --> 00:14:40.680
 After the mid-40s?

00:14:40.680 --> 00:14:41.680
 I think they--

00:14:41.680 --> 00:14:42.680
 By association?

00:14:42.680 --> 00:14:43.680
 I don't know.

00:14:43.680 --> 00:14:45.160
 This is a problem that's doing this show with no Google.

00:14:45.160 --> 00:14:46.160
 Absolutely.

00:14:46.160 --> 00:14:47.160
 Yeah.

00:14:47.160 --> 00:14:50.000
 I'll do one more here, which was sent in by Chloe Martin.

00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:52.880
 She says, "A good Hong Kong fact for you."

00:14:52.880 --> 00:14:57.640
 Redneck seller Terrace in the Hong Kong mid-levels is so named because the original signwriter

00:14:57.640 --> 00:15:02.240
 wrote Alexander Terrace right to left, as in the Chinese way.

00:15:02.240 --> 00:15:03.240
 Redneck seller.

00:15:03.240 --> 00:15:05.240
 Alexander backwards.

00:15:05.240 --> 00:15:06.240
 It's Alexander backwards.

00:15:06.240 --> 00:15:07.520
 Now we've mentioned this on the show.

00:15:07.520 --> 00:15:08.520
 We have.

00:15:08.520 --> 00:15:11.640
 I've mentioned it because my mum and dad lived on that road.

00:15:11.640 --> 00:15:12.640
 Yes.

00:15:12.640 --> 00:15:14.800
 It's a friend of the podcast, Redneck's Hello.

00:15:14.800 --> 00:15:15.800
 Last one?

00:15:15.800 --> 00:15:16.800
 Yeah.

00:15:16.800 --> 00:15:18.400
 Okay, this is from Graeme Wallace.

00:15:18.400 --> 00:15:23.000
 And Graeme says, "You've covered animal regeneration previously, but this seems to be an extreme

00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:24.000
 example.

00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:31.720
 There are two sea slugs from the species sacco-glossin that can amputate their entire body and then

00:15:31.720 --> 00:15:32.720
 come back to life."

00:15:32.720 --> 00:15:36.520
 Wait, what's left if you've amputated your entire body?

00:15:36.520 --> 00:15:37.520
 Your head.

00:15:37.520 --> 00:15:38.520
 Head and body.

00:15:38.520 --> 00:15:39.520
 Separate.

00:15:39.520 --> 00:15:40.520
 Yes.

00:15:40.520 --> 00:15:41.960
 Separate your head from your body.

00:15:41.960 --> 00:15:43.640
 No more shoulders, knees and toes, though.

00:15:43.640 --> 00:15:45.000
 It's a quick game.

00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:46.000
 Head.

00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:47.000
 Head.

00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:52.040
 You've got your eyes and your ears and your mouth and your nose too.

00:15:52.040 --> 00:15:53.040
 You've got your eyes and your mouth.

00:15:53.040 --> 00:15:54.040
 Actually, yeah.

00:15:54.040 --> 00:15:55.040
 Yeah, yeah.

00:15:55.040 --> 00:15:57.600
 So here's the thing.

00:15:57.600 --> 00:16:01.320
 How do you get the energy to regrow your body if you're only ahead and you don't have

00:16:01.320 --> 00:16:02.320
 a digestive system?

00:16:02.320 --> 00:16:06.000
 I guess you can't travel around to eat because you were using your body for that.

00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:11.720
 Even if you could eat, food can't digest your digestive system.

00:16:11.720 --> 00:16:16.480
 I would say small micro-digestive system just in your mouth.

00:16:16.480 --> 00:16:19.920
 It's kind of, but there's something more.

00:16:19.920 --> 00:16:26.360
 Do you park the bottom of the hole in your neck on the anus of another slug and take in

00:16:26.360 --> 00:16:28.600
 the nutrients of what's passed through their body?

00:16:28.600 --> 00:16:29.600
 Wow, Dan.

00:16:29.600 --> 00:16:32.520
 I mean, I could imagine that working.

00:16:32.520 --> 00:16:33.520
 Nature.

00:16:33.520 --> 00:16:34.520
 Wild.

00:16:34.520 --> 00:16:35.520
 Yeah.

00:16:35.520 --> 00:16:38.640
 But a sea slugs, especially, they are wacky.

00:16:38.640 --> 00:16:45.400
 What seems to happen is that they eat some algae and they algae photo-synthesizes creates

00:16:45.400 --> 00:16:49.000
 energy and that gives them the energy to then create their body.

00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:50.000
 Wow.

00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:51.000
 That's insane.

00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:52.000
 I know.

00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:53.000
 That is nature.

00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:54.000
 That is, yeah.

00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:55.000
 That's as weird as you said, Dan.

00:16:55.000 --> 00:16:56.000
 Is it?

00:16:56.000 --> 00:16:59.320
 Yeah, I was going to say is it any weirder than attaching your head onto some wasadas to

00:16:59.320 --> 00:17:00.320
 get the nutrient?

00:17:00.320 --> 00:17:06.960
 It's weirdly like Mary Shelley's Frankenstein monster where it's like electricity was turning,

00:17:06.960 --> 00:17:11.720
 like it's creating this kind of zap sense of question over here.

00:17:11.720 --> 00:17:16.560
 Actually, I don't think she ever says the galvanising forces electricity in the book.

00:17:16.560 --> 00:17:19.960
 No, but in the preface, she does talk about Galvanis experiments.

00:17:19.960 --> 00:17:23.960
 Yes, but that's just an example and actually it's very unclear what chemical mechanism is

00:17:23.960 --> 00:17:25.960
 used to bring the creature to life.

00:17:25.960 --> 00:17:26.960
 Yeah, but I would...

00:17:26.960 --> 00:17:27.960
 So I'm just forced to...

00:17:27.960 --> 00:17:28.960
 I'm just forced to all of you.

00:17:28.960 --> 00:17:34.200
 Well, I would have said Frankenstein in that case, but I said Mary Shelley's Frankenstein,

00:17:34.200 --> 00:17:38.800
 which is the name of the kind of Branagh film.

00:17:38.800 --> 00:17:39.800
 In which...

00:17:39.800 --> 00:17:40.800
 I...

00:17:40.800 --> 00:17:41.800
 Electrocity is used.

00:17:41.800 --> 00:17:43.000
 I'm going to cut off my top not right now.

00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:44.000
 Very nice.

00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:45.000
 Very nice.

00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:46.000
 Okay.

00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:47.000
 Well, this is brilliant.

00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:48.000
 We love these facts coming in.

00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:49.000
 Thank you so much, everyone.

00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:52.760
 And before we wrap up with this episode, we've got one more important thing to do, which

00:17:52.760 --> 00:17:58.560
 is hand out some past headline facts to members of the highest tier friend of the podcast

00:17:58.560 --> 00:18:00.120
 of Club Fish.

00:18:00.120 --> 00:18:01.800
 So who wants to go first?

00:18:01.800 --> 00:18:06.360
 I will.

00:18:06.360 --> 00:18:08.520
 This one goes out to Radu Flueras.

00:18:08.520 --> 00:18:11.480
 A fantastic name, Radu.

00:18:11.480 --> 00:18:17.680
 This is the fact that in medical jargon, lull used to mean little old lady.

00:18:17.680 --> 00:18:22.680
 And that meant that other doctor's acronyms included lolinad, little old lady in no apparent

00:18:22.680 --> 00:18:27.760
 distress, or lalfa de guber, little old lady fall down go boom.

00:18:27.760 --> 00:18:34.640
 This is great, this is episode 27, and we had as guest on the show Helen Zoltzman.

00:18:34.640 --> 00:18:39.400
 It's such a weird one, this kind of medical jargon stuff, because the idea is that doctors

00:18:39.400 --> 00:18:41.520
 write it on your notes.

00:18:41.520 --> 00:18:47.680
 And then I saw a really, really believable debunk saying, "You're allowed to get your notes

00:18:47.680 --> 00:18:48.680
 now.

00:18:48.680 --> 00:18:50.760
 There is absolutely no way that any doctor would do this."

00:18:50.760 --> 00:18:53.880
 And a load of doctors saying, "Yeah, it was a thing that happened in the past, but we

00:18:53.880 --> 00:18:54.880
 don't do it anymore."

00:18:54.880 --> 00:18:58.240
 But then I've heard actual doctors say, "Yeah, we do do that."

00:18:58.240 --> 00:18:59.720
 We do this all the time.

00:18:59.720 --> 00:19:01.360
 So I don't know what to believe.

00:19:01.360 --> 00:19:05.560
 In between carving our initials on your liver during sensitive operations.

00:19:05.560 --> 00:19:10.400
 Yeah, I think probably, oh, definitely used to happen a fair bit before you could get

00:19:10.400 --> 00:19:12.120
 your notes quite so easily.

00:19:12.120 --> 00:19:15.000
 Yeah, and Helen is, of course, a complete podcasting Don.

00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:16.000
 Yes.

00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:17.000
 She's of answer me this.

00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:18.920
 And the illusionist and all sorts of other shows.

00:19:18.920 --> 00:19:23.400
 And I don't think it's too much to say that we were partly inspired to make this show

00:19:23.400 --> 00:19:24.400
 from Helen.

00:19:24.400 --> 00:19:25.400
 I'm not 100%.

00:19:25.400 --> 00:19:28.880
 They showed kind of the potential of what a podcast could be to everyone who was making it

00:19:28.880 --> 00:19:29.880
 at the time.

00:19:29.880 --> 00:19:30.880
 So that was very cool.

00:19:30.880 --> 00:19:31.880
 We love Helen.

00:19:31.880 --> 00:19:32.880
 Okay.

00:19:32.880 --> 00:19:36.400
 Here is one for Alice Jackson and Alice, your fact.

00:19:36.400 --> 00:19:39.000
 I'm sorry, it's another down tribe or one.

00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:40.000
 Only joking.

00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:41.000
 No, it's great fact.

00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:46.040
 It is that according to researchers at Glasgow, Caledonian University, listening to Billy

00:19:46.040 --> 00:19:52.080
 Connelly can substantially increase your tolerance to pain.

00:19:52.080 --> 00:19:54.280
 And this is the way that they do this.

00:19:54.280 --> 00:19:58.400
 You put your hand in ice for as long as possible.

00:19:58.400 --> 00:20:01.080
 And you take it out when you can't manage it any longer.

00:20:01.080 --> 00:20:02.640
 And they've done a few experiments like this.

00:20:02.640 --> 00:20:09.360
 The famous one is the one about swearing, which is you could keep your hand in the ice for

00:20:09.360 --> 00:20:16.080
 longer if you're just going, if you're just going, yeah, if you're just doing a thick

00:20:16.080 --> 00:20:23.000
 Scottish accent, I can understand what you were saying, the old Ron Brown.

00:20:23.000 --> 00:20:24.800
 Well congrats to you, Alice.

00:20:24.800 --> 00:20:26.120
 That's your fact.

00:20:26.120 --> 00:20:27.680
 And now Kate Haymes.

00:20:27.680 --> 00:20:28.680
 We have one for you.

00:20:28.680 --> 00:20:29.680
 Is it not Haymes?

00:20:29.680 --> 00:20:34.240
 No, it's just laughing because do you remember, you called me Haymes for quite a long time?

00:20:34.240 --> 00:20:35.240
 Hummus.

00:20:35.240 --> 00:20:36.240
 Hummus.

00:20:36.240 --> 00:20:39.240
 But I think one reason was, did I not get mentioned in someone's book?

00:20:39.240 --> 00:20:40.240
 Yeah.

00:20:40.240 --> 00:20:46.200
 You received an acknowledgement in Steve Colgan's book, which was Haymes Harkin, and you became

00:20:46.200 --> 00:20:47.840
 Haymes for a very long time.

00:20:47.840 --> 00:20:48.840
 Yeah.

00:20:48.840 --> 00:20:51.120
 So Kate Haymes, this is your fact.

00:20:51.120 --> 00:20:55.960
 The first woman to cycle the world, learn to ride a bike the day before she set off.

00:20:55.960 --> 00:20:58.960
 Is this friend of the podcast, Annie London Derry?

00:20:58.960 --> 00:20:59.960
 Annie London Derry.

00:20:59.960 --> 00:21:00.960
 Yes.

00:21:00.960 --> 00:21:08.080
 Who was an amazing world traveling cycling lady, and she was, I think she was about 23 when

00:21:08.080 --> 00:21:09.080
 she did it.

00:21:09.080 --> 00:21:10.080
 She was so young.

00:21:10.080 --> 00:21:13.160
 I think she might even have had a husband and children who she might have written out of

00:21:13.160 --> 00:21:14.160
 the story.

00:21:14.160 --> 00:21:15.160
 She did.

00:21:15.160 --> 00:21:17.960
 Which she was selling to the press because she wanted to be like young single cool lady.

00:21:17.960 --> 00:21:18.960
 Right.

00:21:18.960 --> 00:21:19.960
 Get's press attention.

00:21:19.960 --> 00:21:22.840
 That's a lot of the story, but there's so much more to it.

00:21:22.840 --> 00:21:26.720
 And you can read all about it in the excellent book, Everything to Play for.

00:21:26.720 --> 00:21:30.280
 The QI Book of Sport by James Harkin and Anna Toshinsky.

00:21:30.280 --> 00:21:31.880
 She has a whole chapter about her.

00:21:31.880 --> 00:21:32.880
 Yeah.

00:21:32.880 --> 00:21:33.880
 Oh, you can just go on Wikipedia.

00:21:33.880 --> 00:21:34.880
 I mean, it's all out.

00:21:34.880 --> 00:21:38.520
 Well, you can listen back to episode 27 as well.

00:21:38.520 --> 00:21:42.280
 I think we found some stuff that isn't Wikipedia for that.

00:21:42.280 --> 00:21:47.160
 We went to the old newspaper archives because she was in the newspapers quite a lot, and

00:21:47.160 --> 00:21:52.520
 they gave lots of really amazing stories of when she fell off her bike and all this kind

00:21:52.520 --> 00:21:53.520
 of stuff.

00:21:53.520 --> 00:21:54.520
 Nice.

00:21:54.520 --> 00:21:55.680
 And do you think, did she cheat for any bits?

00:21:55.680 --> 00:21:57.400
 Obviously, she went on boats over the ocean bits.

00:21:57.400 --> 00:21:58.400
 Yeah.

00:21:58.400 --> 00:22:02.800
 We think that a lot of her stories should be taken with a bit of a pinch of salt.

00:22:02.800 --> 00:22:03.800
 Yeah.

00:22:03.800 --> 00:22:04.800
 But she was very cool.

00:22:04.800 --> 00:22:05.800
 Yeah.

00:22:05.800 --> 00:22:06.800
 Super cool.

00:22:06.800 --> 00:22:07.800
 Very early friend of the podcast.

00:22:07.800 --> 00:22:08.800
 One of the first ever friends of the podcast, actually.

00:22:08.800 --> 00:22:09.800
 Yeah.

00:22:09.800 --> 00:22:10.800
 But she did make it, too.

00:22:10.800 --> 00:22:11.800
 We did recently.

00:22:11.800 --> 00:22:15.000
 If you're part of the top tier of Club Fish, there is the friend of the podcast

00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:16.000
 here.

00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:20.320
 For three months, you get sent a T-shirt, and we have made a friends of the podcast T-shirt,

00:22:20.320 --> 00:22:22.880
 which lists all of the greatest friends of the podcast.

00:22:22.880 --> 00:22:24.280
 And she makes it on there.

00:22:24.280 --> 00:22:25.520
 And the London Dairy appears.

00:22:25.520 --> 00:22:27.640
 Andy, let's go to you.

00:22:27.640 --> 00:22:29.960
 This is a fact that goes to Mark Norman.

00:22:29.960 --> 00:22:34.840
 Mark, your fact is that when Californian ground squirrels are attacked by snakes, they increase

00:22:34.840 --> 00:22:39.920
 their blood pressure, so their tail gives off more infrared radiation, making them look

00:22:39.920 --> 00:22:40.920
 bigger.

00:22:40.920 --> 00:22:44.040
 You might be thinking, well, my blood pressure would increase if I was being shredded

00:22:44.040 --> 00:22:48.800
 by a rattlesnake, but the really cool thing is they do this with rattlesnakes, which they

00:22:48.800 --> 00:22:55.280
 know can see an infrared, even though the squirrel itself can't see an infrared, it knows

00:22:55.280 --> 00:22:56.800
 that the snake can.

00:22:56.800 --> 00:22:57.800
 It's fascinating.

00:22:57.800 --> 00:22:58.960
 And it doesn't do it with other snakes.

00:22:58.960 --> 00:23:05.920
 So we know it's a deliberate thing because it knows it works, maybe it doesn't know about

00:23:05.920 --> 00:23:06.920
 the infrared spectrum.

00:23:06.920 --> 00:23:07.920
 Yeah.

00:23:07.920 --> 00:23:11.840
 It just does something, and this works against that snake, and they're like, guys, we should

00:23:11.840 --> 00:23:12.840
 do that again.

00:23:12.840 --> 00:23:13.840
 Exactly.

00:23:13.840 --> 00:23:15.360
 So that is a fact.

00:23:15.360 --> 00:23:23.000
 This one goes to JDG, JDG, I don't know what they stand for, but I think the J might be

00:23:23.000 --> 00:23:25.040
 Joshua looking at your email address.

00:23:25.040 --> 00:23:31.200
 But anyway, JDG, this is your fact now, and that is that every day over 100 people used

00:23:31.200 --> 00:23:35.680
 to watch King Louis the 14th get up and get dressed.

00:23:35.680 --> 00:23:36.680
 Magnificent.

00:23:36.680 --> 00:23:37.680
 Yeah.

00:23:37.680 --> 00:23:43.200
 Yeah, that was one of your facts, Andy, and it was a brilliant fact about, yeah, about

00:23:43.200 --> 00:23:45.600
 how his life was just on display.

00:23:45.600 --> 00:23:46.600
 Yeah.

00:23:46.600 --> 00:23:47.960
 It was called the Revive, wasn't it?

00:23:47.960 --> 00:23:52.720
 And people just woke up and, well, they woke up early and then went to watch him wake up, and

00:23:52.720 --> 00:23:56.080
 then they watched him have his first "we" of the day, and then they watched him get dressed,

00:23:56.080 --> 00:23:57.920
 and then they watched him have his breakfast.

00:23:57.920 --> 00:23:58.920
 Yes.

00:23:58.920 --> 00:24:02.800
 We're actually thinking of launching a higher tier where you can get this kind of access

00:24:02.800 --> 00:24:05.880
 to, if anyone registers their interest.

00:24:05.880 --> 00:24:06.880
 Yeah.

00:24:06.880 --> 00:24:07.880
 Very cool.

00:24:07.880 --> 00:24:08.880
 I'm going to read out the next one here.

00:24:08.880 --> 00:24:14.680
 By the way, that last fact was from episode 28, so here's the second one from that episode,

00:24:14.680 --> 00:24:19.560
 which is now under the custodianship of Gemma Donald, and it is that there is an original

00:24:19.560 --> 00:24:23.640
 Picasso that we will never see because it was eaten by the dog.

00:24:23.640 --> 00:24:24.640
 Really nice.

00:24:24.640 --> 00:24:27.440
 I know he was very prolific, Picasso, wasn't he?

00:24:27.440 --> 00:24:28.440
 Yeah.

00:24:28.440 --> 00:24:35.040
 And he was the one who also did a supposedly did the drawing on a napkin to pay for his

00:24:35.040 --> 00:24:36.040
 classes.

00:24:36.040 --> 00:24:37.040
 That's right.

00:24:37.040 --> 00:24:40.960
 So Mr. Picasso, can you sign it, please, and he said, "No, I want to pay for my coffee,

00:24:40.960 --> 00:24:41.960
 not the entire cafe."

00:24:41.960 --> 00:24:42.960
 Yes.

00:24:42.960 --> 00:24:45.800
 It was a way to indeed yourself to the staff, isn't it?

00:24:45.800 --> 00:24:47.360
 Do you guys ever do this in cafes or restaurants?

00:24:47.360 --> 00:24:48.360
 I do it all the time.

00:24:48.360 --> 00:24:49.360
 Yeah.

00:24:49.360 --> 00:24:53.560
 Half of them are sort of a bit of tedious humour, and you know, yeah, get a 10% off.

00:24:53.560 --> 00:24:55.560
 So get a 10% off?

00:24:55.560 --> 00:24:56.560
 Five?

00:24:56.560 --> 00:24:57.560
 Yeah.

00:24:57.560 --> 00:24:58.800
 Okay, we'll just take a service, Trump.

00:24:58.800 --> 00:24:59.800
 Yeah.

00:24:59.800 --> 00:25:00.800
 Thank you very much.

00:25:00.800 --> 00:25:04.520
 They've actually added 10% to the bill.

00:25:04.520 --> 00:25:05.520
 Time wasting.

00:25:05.520 --> 00:25:07.600
 Oh, here's another one.

00:25:07.600 --> 00:25:08.600
 Yep.

00:25:08.600 --> 00:25:11.160
 It goes out to J.F.

00:25:11.160 --> 00:25:15.660
 This is the fact is that during the Second World War, the U.S. Navy diving manual contained

00:25:15.660 --> 00:25:19.640
 detailed instructions over what to do if eaten by a giant clam.

00:25:19.640 --> 00:25:20.640
 Wow.

00:25:20.640 --> 00:25:21.640
 Yes.

00:25:21.640 --> 00:25:22.640
 Yes.

00:25:22.640 --> 00:25:23.640
 Nice.

00:25:23.640 --> 00:25:24.640
 That was one of mine.

00:25:24.640 --> 00:25:27.400
 I can't remember the details about it now, but it was just in this, I remember seeing

00:25:27.400 --> 00:25:28.400
 the images.

00:25:28.400 --> 00:25:29.400
 Yeah.

00:25:29.400 --> 00:25:30.400
 I remember.

00:25:30.400 --> 00:25:34.640
 And then we looked into it and actually a giant clam isn't strong enough to take an hour

00:25:34.640 --> 00:25:35.640
 to close.

00:25:35.640 --> 00:25:36.640
 Yeah.

00:25:36.640 --> 00:25:39.960
 And even if it did close, it has little gaps in it and you'd be able to get your foot out

00:25:39.960 --> 00:25:40.960
 anyway.

00:25:40.960 --> 00:25:41.960
 Yeah.

00:25:41.960 --> 00:25:42.960
 Just a clam.

00:25:42.960 --> 00:25:43.960
 Grow up.

00:25:43.960 --> 00:25:48.640
 I don't want to be responsible as a podcast for anyone being eaten by a giant clam.

00:25:48.640 --> 00:25:52.320
 And I'm saying, oh, I'm just going to keep my foot in here for an hour because those things

00:25:52.320 --> 00:25:53.320
 are fish set.

00:25:53.320 --> 00:25:54.320
 That's the answer easily.

00:25:54.320 --> 00:25:55.320
 Wiggle it out.

00:25:55.320 --> 00:25:56.320
 I call myself things are fish.

00:25:56.320 --> 00:25:58.320
 They know what they're talking about in the underwater realm.

00:25:58.320 --> 00:25:59.320
 I find.

00:25:59.320 --> 00:26:03.560
 I sort of think it would be cool if we were responsible for that.

00:26:03.560 --> 00:26:06.080
 Well, we're trying to get publicity this year, aren't we?

00:26:06.080 --> 00:26:08.200
 It's the year of putting ourselves out there.

00:26:08.200 --> 00:26:09.200
 They're right.

00:26:09.200 --> 00:26:13.760
 So I think it's a guessing listeners eating my giant clams is one way of doing it.

00:26:13.760 --> 00:26:14.760
 Yeah.

00:26:14.760 --> 00:26:15.760
 Is that all the one show?

00:26:15.760 --> 00:26:20.720
 I think the problem with that is if we try and get our listenership up by doing away

00:26:20.720 --> 00:26:25.760
 with our listeners, you know, we have to get two new listeners for the one that we've

00:26:25.760 --> 00:26:26.760
 lost.

00:26:26.760 --> 00:26:27.760
 Do you know what?

00:26:27.760 --> 00:26:28.760
 That's a really good point.

00:26:28.760 --> 00:26:29.760
 That's a really good point.

00:26:29.760 --> 00:26:30.760
 Okay.

00:26:30.760 --> 00:26:39.160
 There we go, our latest custodians, congratulations to JF, to Gemma, to JDG, to Mark, Kate, Alice, and

00:26:39.160 --> 00:26:40.480
 Radu.

00:26:40.480 --> 00:26:42.200
 You are now the custodians of all these facts.

00:26:42.200 --> 00:26:46.760
 If you yourself would like to get ownership of one of our facts, all you need to do is join

00:26:46.760 --> 00:26:53.520
 the top tier of Clubfish, go to patreon.com/nosuchthing as a fish and not only will you be given

00:26:53.520 --> 00:27:00.080
 a shout out on the show, but we will also send you a digital certificate and do with that.

00:27:00.080 --> 00:27:01.080
 What you like.

00:27:01.080 --> 00:27:03.640
 Anyway, we're going to be back again next week.

00:27:03.640 --> 00:27:05.200
 Do keep sending us your facts.

00:27:05.200 --> 00:27:08.160
 We absolutely love reading them out here on Little Fish.

00:27:08.160 --> 00:27:12.000
 Otherwise, come join us again on Friday for another regular episode of No Such Thing

00:27:12.000 --> 00:27:13.000
 as a Fish.

00:27:13.000 --> 00:27:14.000
 We will see you then.

00:27:14.000 --> 00:27:15.000
 Goodbye.
