2
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:15,000
 Hey everyone!

3
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,600
 Welcome to another episode of Little Fish.

4
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:22,040
 This is the show where we put down our favorite facts from the last seven days and we go

5
00:00:22,040 --> 00:00:25,640
 through the podcast@QI.com inbox.

6
00:00:25,640 --> 00:00:29,480
 We pick out the best facts that you have all found and we're going to read them out now.

7
00:00:29,480 --> 00:00:32,100
 I'm sitting here with James Harkin and Drew Hunter Murray.

8
00:00:32,100 --> 00:00:34,100
 Guys, let's do it, who's got a fact?

9
00:00:34,100 --> 00:00:35,100
 I've got one.

10
00:00:35,100 --> 00:00:36,100
 This is a great one.

11
00:00:36,100 --> 00:00:38,580
 It's from James Patterson and it's that.

12
00:00:38,580 --> 00:00:39,580
 The author?

13
00:00:39,580 --> 00:00:40,580
 No.

14
00:00:40,580 --> 00:00:41,580
 Up to you now.

15
00:00:41,580 --> 00:00:42,580
 It spells slightly differently.

16
00:00:42,580 --> 00:00:43,580
 Oh.

17
00:00:43,580 --> 00:00:47,580
 I've got another for everything.

18
00:00:47,580 --> 00:00:52,920
 James Patterson, all James Patterson using an incredibly unimaginative non-duplube.

19
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:58,640
 The fact is that during the Cold War, a KGB agent had several meetings with Edinburgh

20
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:03,080
 for a Leith MP and communist sympathiser, Ron Brown.

21
00:01:03,080 --> 00:01:08,120
 However, they were unsure if he was spying for them or not because they couldn't understand

22
00:01:08,120 --> 00:01:12,280
 his thick Scottish accent and had no idea what he was telling them.

23
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:13,280
 [laughter]

24
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:14,280
 That's incredible.

25
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:15,280
 It's true.

26
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:17,720
 This is you do some reading on that, is that true?

27
00:01:17,720 --> 00:01:18,720
 A little bit.

28
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:25,120
 It's from the Ben McIntyre book about Oleg Gordievsky, who was, I think, a double agent on various

29
00:01:25,120 --> 00:01:26,620
 sides.

30
00:01:26,620 --> 00:01:30,700
 The quote was, "Brown may have been leaking top grade secrets, but equally, you might have

31
00:01:30,700 --> 00:01:31,700
 been talking about football."

32
00:01:31,700 --> 00:01:32,700
 They just couldn't tell.

33
00:01:32,700 --> 00:01:33,700
 They just couldn't tell.

34
00:01:33,700 --> 00:01:34,700
 Amazing.

35
00:01:34,700 --> 00:01:37,900
 Can I just say, my wife is Russian, as has been mentioned a few times on the show, and she

36
00:01:37,900 --> 00:01:40,420
 actually found the Scottish accent the easiest to understand.

37
00:01:40,420 --> 00:01:41,420
 That's so interesting.

38
00:01:41,420 --> 00:01:42,580
 I don't know why.

39
00:01:42,580 --> 00:01:45,660
 When you learn another language, it's kind of, you can understand it usually, but when people

40
00:01:45,660 --> 00:01:47,420
 talk over each other, that's when it's tricky.

41
00:01:47,420 --> 00:01:48,420
 That's what she can do.

42
00:01:48,420 --> 00:01:49,420
 It's the cadence.

43
00:01:49,420 --> 00:01:54,320
 I mean, because there are Scottish accents and Scottish accents, you can get some really,

44
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:55,320
 really hot.

45
00:01:55,320 --> 00:01:57,640
 Obviously, Edinburgh is a relatively soft accent.

46
00:01:57,640 --> 00:01:58,640
 Yeah.

47
00:01:58,640 --> 00:01:59,640
 It is absolutely.

48
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:02,160
 Let's go as often said to be the harder of the two to forget.

49
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:03,160
 Yeah.

50
00:02:03,160 --> 00:02:04,400
 I don't know where Ron Brown was from.

51
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:08,360
 I mean, he was the MP for that, but he was apparently a colourful character.

52
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:12,680
 He was a labour MP who damaged the parliamentary mace in a row over the poltax and ended up in

53
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:15,600
 court for stealing his mistresses' underwear.

54
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:16,600
 Wow.

55
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:17,600
 Yeah.

56
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:18,840
 That's very cool.

57
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:21,480
 I have another political one.

58
00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:23,040
 Should we jump to that very quickly?

59
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:28,120
 So this is sent into us by Brady Steeper, and it's to do with Canada's longest-serving

60
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:31,080
 Prime Minister, who is called William King.

61
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:34,520
 So he says it's important to know, before hearing this fact, that he guided the country through

62
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:38,840
 the Great Depression, the Second World War, established Canadian citizenship, and successfully

63
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:43,120
 challenged the power of the crown, and the guy who he was challenging it against was called

64
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:49,640
 Lord Bing in a delightfully-named constitutional crisis called the King Bing Affair, or the King

65
00:02:49,640 --> 00:02:50,640
 Bing Wingding.

66
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:51,640
 Yes.

67
00:02:51,640 --> 00:02:54,880
 I presume they were just wasting, but at some point had to have a wingding.

68
00:02:54,880 --> 00:02:55,880
 Yeah.

69
00:02:55,880 --> 00:02:59,880
 I've never heard the phrase "wingding" used outside of fonts.

70
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:00,880
 Oh, yeah.

71
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:02,280
 I didn't know it was a thing.

72
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:03,280
 A wingding was a thing.

73
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:04,280
 Love it.

74
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:06,120
 No, I don't think I did either.

75
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:07,120
 No.

76
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:08,120
 I think you say, "Oh, we had a wingding."

77
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:09,120
 I've heard that.

78
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:10,920
 No, I've heard we had a ding dong.

79
00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:21,520
 That was the Prime Minister of China, Mr. Ding, and the Vietnamese currency, the dog.

80
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:24,240
 Don't dig, don't dig, don't.

81
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:31,760
 Anyway, the fact that Brady wanted to send to us is that on his death, King donated his

82
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:36,480
 estate to the Canadian government, and that included all of his diaries, 172 volumes.

83
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:37,480
 Wow.

84
00:03:37,480 --> 00:03:44,000
 And when they were read, they revealed that he made huge use of sails during his term as

85
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,280
 Prime Minister.

86
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:48,880
 So while he was Prime Minister, he was consulting with his dead mother.

87
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:54,080
 He was consulting with a former dead prime minister, so Wilfred Lawrear, and his dog,

88
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:55,080
 Pat.

89
00:03:55,080 --> 00:03:56,560
 He would talk to his dog, Pat.

90
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:58,680
 I think he stands up in Parliament.

91
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:04,680
 I think we need more biscuits.

92
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:20,040
 And one of the things to say, "Woo!"

93
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:28,560
 Yeah, but I mean, apparently he spoke to Pat about the importance of the involvement that Canada had in the Second World War, conscription into the army.

94
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:34,920
 And he would use either his dead mother or a former Prime Minister as a sort of soundboard.

95
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:37,120
 Can you choose who you get to win a sails?

96
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:38,120
 I don't really know much about that.

97
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:39,120
 You can try and request.

98
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:44,080
 I think that's largely people go, and they hope that someone that's on their mind will show up.

99
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:48,600
 No, but if you've got a particular previous Prime Minister, can you say, I'd rather have someone from the other party, actually.

100
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:50,600
 Or can you say, like, is Genghis Khan available?

101
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:52,120
 We're in the middle of a total war.

102
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:53,600
 I'm sure you could.

103
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:54,600
 Yeah, I'm sure you could.

104
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:56,360
 It depends on how pliable your medium is, I guess.

105
00:04:56,360 --> 00:04:57,360
 Yeah, exactly.

106
00:04:57,360 --> 00:04:58,360
 Yeah.

107
00:04:58,360 --> 00:05:02,320
 And the news about the Canadian Prime Minister, was he in Davos?

108
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:03,320
 Can't he?

109
00:05:03,320 --> 00:05:05,320
 Yeah, he stole some sandwiches.

110
00:05:05,320 --> 00:05:07,560
 It was the Mark Carnie, Sally Barney.

111
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:08,560
 Oh, my God.

112
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:11,560
 I was wondering why you hadn't said anything for the last minute.

113
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:14,560
 [laughter]

114
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:17,200
 I can't believe you let me go through a whole sails chat.

115
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:19,200
 I'm sorry, I wasn't listening to any of that.

116
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:24,240
 You're going to be shocked when you hear what happened while you were gone into your pun temple.

117
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:32,440
 OK, here is a fact from Sasha M and Sasha says, well, Sasha sends us what they call an almost

118
00:05:32,440 --> 00:05:35,960
 perfect sentence with no further context.

119
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:38,240
 This is from Harper's magazine.

120
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:44,960
 And the sentence goes, South African tafonomists found that pigs decompose more slowly when they

121
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:51,040
 are wearing winter garments, and more quickly when they are eaten by the Cape Grey Mungoos.

122
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:53,920
 Yes, I sort of would have expected that last bit.

123
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:55,120
 I guess.

124
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:58,120
 [laughter]

125
00:05:58,120 --> 00:05:59,120
 It's a brilliant sentence.

126
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:00,120
 I love it.

127
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:01,120
 Yeah.

128
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:02,120
 Absolutely fantastic.

129
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:03,120
 What garments as well?

130
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:09,640
 Yeah, well, what they do is they use pigs decomposing to analogize to humans like you.

131
00:06:09,640 --> 00:06:12,560
 If you want to do an experiment, see how humans are going to decompose.

132
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:14,440
 You can't get a human and do it, right?

133
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:15,440
 Right, right.

134
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:16,440
 But you can't get a pig.

135
00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:18,640
 There might be one left over from an abattoir or something.

136
00:06:18,640 --> 00:06:19,640
 Yeah.

137
00:06:19,640 --> 00:06:20,640
 And so that's why they do it.

138
00:06:20,640 --> 00:06:26,160
 Or they put them in garments to see how the pig decomposes, in case someone has been,

139
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:29,640
 like let's say you find a body in the top of the mountain.

140
00:06:29,640 --> 00:06:31,800
 And it's at a certain level of decomposition.

141
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:33,120
 You compare it with the pig.

142
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:36,800
 No, but I'm just imagining the process is getting the winter garments, like having to drag

143
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:38,720
 a dead pig into a branch of North Face.

144
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:39,720
 Yeah.

145
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:40,720
 Yeah.

146
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:43,880
 We need something a little bit bigger in the waste of afraid the only.

147
00:06:43,880 --> 00:06:44,880
 [laughter]

148
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:45,880
 Wow.

149
00:06:45,880 --> 00:06:46,880
 Wow.

150
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:47,880
 That's a great sentence.

151
00:06:47,880 --> 00:06:48,880
 Yeah, lovely.

152
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:54,880
 And a brilliant study, this was from quite a few years ago now, about 20 or 30 years ago,

153
00:06:54,880 --> 00:07:00,880
 but they put three tons of dead pigs in the middle of a forest in America.

154
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:04,520
 And again, they wanted to see how, what would happen when it decomposed.

155
00:07:04,520 --> 00:07:05,800
 And this one was slightly different.

156
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:09,600
 They wanted to see if there was a big die off of any animal.

157
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:11,160
 How it would affect the ecosystem.

158
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:12,160
 Interesting.

159
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:15,520
 So they put these dead pigs in the middle of the forest.

160
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:20,080
 They looked at first the vultures came and then the maggots and then the flies and all that

161
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:21,360
 kind of stuff.

162
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:27,840
 And basically, what they found is it gets really nasty, really quite quickly.

163
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:32,920
 And not only did it get really nasty and there was dead pig everywhere, it was all rotten,

164
00:07:32,920 --> 00:07:37,760
 actually the area never really recovered, and it still hasn't really recovered.

165
00:07:37,760 --> 00:07:42,600
 And they're still studying it today because it's not back to how it was when they did the

166
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:43,600
 study.

167
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:44,600
 Gosh.

168
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:45,600
 So yeah, that's wild.

169
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:46,600
 That is wild.

170
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:50,200
 Again, it's just scientists, you know, you need to know this stuff.

171
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:51,200
 Absolutely.

172
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:52,200
 You don't know when it's going to be useful in the future.

173
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:53,200
 Absolutely.

174
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:54,200
 Yeah.

175
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:55,200
 Andy, you.

176
00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:56,200
 Let's get a fact.

177
00:07:56,200 --> 00:07:57,200
 This is you.

178
00:07:57,200 --> 00:08:02,000
 This is a fact from Nicholas Wilkinson, who begins unpromising.

179
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:07,440
 It's maybe not exactly a fact, but you know the pangolin, yeah, okay.

180
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:09,280
 It's a strange, scaly creature, isn't it?

181
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:10,280
 It's quite hardsheld.

182
00:08:10,280 --> 00:08:11,280
 Hardsheld.

183
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:12,280
 Yeah.

184
00:08:12,280 --> 00:08:19,120
 It looks a bit like an armadillo, lovely long claws, traditional Chinese medicine, get

185
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:20,280
 through a fair few.

186
00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:22,080
 I think they've just been removed from the official.

187
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:24,880
 I think they're the most trafficked animal in the world.

188
00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:26,480
 Well, I'm glad you say that.

189
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:27,480
 I'm not glad you say that.

190
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:30,680
 I'm incredibly sad to say that because they're lovely.

191
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:31,680
 Sorry.

192
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:33,880
 I've got.

193
00:08:33,880 --> 00:08:38,200
 So you know the thing of more sharks, many, many more sharks are killed by people than

194
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:39,680
 people are killed by sharks.

195
00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:40,680
 Yeah.

196
00:08:40,680 --> 00:08:44,880
 So Nicholas writes, this is similar because of the trade in pangolin products.

197
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:50,440
 About a million pangolins are very sadly killed by humans each year, obviously horrendous.

198
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:57,280
 The total of humans killed by pangolins is one, okay.

199
00:08:57,280 --> 00:08:58,600
 So they have no teeth.

200
00:08:58,600 --> 00:08:59,600
 They're slow moving.

201
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:02,240
 They have poor eyesight and they're about the size of a cat, okay.

202
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:07,440
 So it's an amazing story is from the book Mammals of Thailand, right?

203
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:12,080
 In Threaten, the pangolin will wrap its tail completely around itself, turning itself

204
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:13,680
 into a ball, basically.

205
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:18,120
 So it's almost impossible to unfold, like an armadillo or a hedgehog, whatever.

206
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:22,800
 But this is related by a naturalist called WWA Phillips, a villager, clubbed a pangolin

207
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:25,480
 one day in the jungle and started back for his village.

208
00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:29,240
 The pangolin slung over his neck, the tail hanging down on one side, the head on the

209
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:30,240
 other.

210
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:33,720
 But the pangolin was merely stunned.

211
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:37,360
 When found later, the man was dead on the trail, strangled, because the pangolin

212
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:41,160
 had suddenly come too and then thought, "Coyle up, defensive."

213
00:09:41,160 --> 00:09:42,160
 Pangolin's strangling.

214
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:43,160
 Oh my God.

215
00:09:43,160 --> 00:09:46,760
 If only there was a head of state that arrived with that.

216
00:09:46,760 --> 00:09:51,200
 If you could think of a head of state, if you rise with pangolin or strangling, podcast

217
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:52,200
 at gui.com.

218
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:53,200
 Yeah.

219
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:57,520
 And it was still curled around his neck when the guy was found proving he'd been the victim

220
00:09:57,520 --> 00:09:59,800
 of a scaly mugging, you go?

221
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:00,800
 Yeah.

222
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:01,800
 Really good.

223
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:02,800
 Amazing.

224
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:03,800
 Very interesting.

225
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:04,800
 What story?

226
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:12,040
 In the world of animals, jelke, ludalfilge, apologies for the pronunciation there.

227
00:10:12,040 --> 00:10:15,280
 No, no, it's ludalfilge.

228
00:10:15,280 --> 00:10:23,080
 It's very rare to hear you nail at the first time, but jelke, J-E-L-K-E.

229
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:24,080
 Jelke, probably.

230
00:10:24,080 --> 00:10:29,480
 But that was exactly how you speak when you're doing the impression of the Nobel committee.

231
00:10:29,480 --> 00:10:30,480
 Sorry.

232
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:33,520
 Jelke or Jelke.

233
00:10:33,520 --> 00:10:38,640
 But it's a great fact, you've sent in, which is when biologists catch lizards during fieldwork,

234
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:43,560
 they use a loop of dental floss with which they lasso the lizard.

235
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:49,000
 This makes sure that the lizard remains unharmed and can be later released again without injury.

236
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:53,680
 The lasso is, of course, known as a lizzu.

237
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:55,800
 So a little dental floss lasso for lizards.

238
00:10:55,800 --> 00:10:57,360
 That's really quite sweet.

239
00:10:57,360 --> 00:10:58,360
 It is quite sweet.

240
00:10:58,360 --> 00:10:59,360
 Yeah.

241
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:00,360
 I love it.

242
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:06,400
 This is a fact from Sam Walker, which Sam describes as a little fun fact, but let's see what you

243
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:07,400
 think.

244
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:15,920
 Sam says that the average ejaculate contains approximately 220,000 terabytes of data.

245
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:16,920
 Terabytes?

246
00:11:16,920 --> 00:11:17,920
 Yes.

247
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:18,920
 Terabytes.

248
00:11:18,920 --> 00:11:19,920
 That's massive, isn't it?

249
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:20,920
 Like, one terabyte is very big.

250
00:11:20,920 --> 00:11:22,920
 It's more than I've got on my computer.

251
00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:23,920
 Oh, dear.

252
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:25,920
 You can't get clot.

253
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:26,920
 You can get special clots.

254
00:11:26,920 --> 00:11:31,240
 Why one of the lights, and that'll show you where you need to devote most intensive attention

255
00:11:31,240 --> 00:11:32,240
 to.

256
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:33,240
 Oh, dear.

257
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:40,680
 You know when you walk straight into your own trap.

258
00:11:40,680 --> 00:11:44,560
 You could almost physically hear the funk as your head hit.

259
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:45,560
 Oh.

260
00:11:45,560 --> 00:11:50,560
 A prophesied showbub and the rex, wasn't it?

261
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:51,560
 Wow.

262
00:11:51,560 --> 00:11:59,960
 But yeah, this is because each sperm contains around 37.5 megabytes of DNA data, which is basically

263
00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:03,080
 your genome is in every, okay.

264
00:12:03,080 --> 00:12:07,120
 And there's a lot of sperms in an ejaculate.

265
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:12,920
 But I think if you were to put it in a zip file, if you were to compress it, because actually

266
00:12:12,920 --> 00:12:15,400
 all the data is kind of very similar.

267
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:20,120
 If it's gone into a zip, something's gone wrong.

268
00:12:20,120 --> 00:12:26,520
 What I'm saying, like there's a fact that says that the amount of data is the same as the

269
00:12:26,520 --> 00:12:33,160
 entirety of English Wikipedia, approximately 40,000 times that amount of data.

270
00:12:33,160 --> 00:12:35,840
 But the truth is that all that data is almost the same.

271
00:12:35,840 --> 00:12:39,080
 So if you were to put it into your computer, you can compress it.

272
00:12:39,080 --> 00:12:41,520
 And actually, I think it would be much, much smaller than that.

273
00:12:41,520 --> 00:12:42,520
 Okay.

274
00:12:42,520 --> 00:12:47,720
 Because it's like, the thing is about data is you can have like Mary has a little lamb

275
00:12:47,720 --> 00:12:48,720
 written down.

276
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:51,760
 But you could do the same thing 200 million times.

277
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:53,680
 But is there really any more data there?

278
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:55,920
 Or is it the same amount of data just replicated?

279
00:12:55,920 --> 00:13:00,280
 So there's a lot of, hmm, just a receptionist at the sperm, please go.

280
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:01,280
 Thank you, Mr. Harkin.

281
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:03,160
 But actually, we just need you to put the sample.

282
00:13:03,160 --> 00:13:04,160
 Thank you.

283
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:09,960
 But I will pass that on to, I'm writing it down zip file, I've got to hear.

284
00:13:09,960 --> 00:13:12,320
 And you're going to need to give that a wife.

285
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:23,800
 This is a very breast one from Kenneth Bowman or Bowman.

286
00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:25,600
 Hopefully this is suitable for little fish.

287
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:29,120
 I work for a competitor of Chevrolet, so this one stings a bit.

288
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:34,360
 The Chevrolet Suburban is the longest-produced automobile model or name plate still in production

289
00:13:34,360 --> 00:13:35,360
 today.

290
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:37,440
 It was introduced in 1934.

291
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:38,440
 Wow.

292
00:13:38,440 --> 00:13:41,880
 They've been making Chevrolet Suburban since 1934.

293
00:13:41,880 --> 00:13:42,880
 Weird.

294
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:48,080
 I can't picture anything, but I can't imagine what a Chevy is.

295
00:13:48,080 --> 00:13:50,720
 It's a, it's a, it's a, it's a really quite big American car.

296
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:51,720
 Is it?

297
00:13:51,720 --> 00:13:54,080
 I know I'm sure they get much bigger, but it is on its 12th generation.

298
00:13:54,080 --> 00:13:57,120
 Like, if you look at the first generation model, it does look different to the modern.

299
00:13:57,120 --> 00:13:58,120
 Really?

300
00:13:58,120 --> 00:13:59,120
 Yeah.

301
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:00,120
 Of course.

302
00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:01,120
 Yeah.

303
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:02,360
 Like Dr. Who is just exactly, exactly.

304
00:14:02,360 --> 00:14:03,360
 Yeah.

305
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:04,520
 Also on roughly the 12th generation model.

306
00:14:04,520 --> 00:14:06,520
 That's what it, when, yeah, I can't remember, actually.

307
00:14:06,520 --> 00:14:07,520
 Yeah.

308
00:14:07,520 --> 00:14:09,520
 A wretching in the armor for you, then.

309
00:14:09,520 --> 00:14:15,240
 Are we counting the audio books?

310
00:14:15,240 --> 00:14:16,240
 That's amazing.

311
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:17,240
 Yeah, it's good, isn't it?

312
00:14:17,240 --> 00:14:19,840
 Is there any other ones that are kind of similar?

313
00:14:19,840 --> 00:14:20,840
 I can't imagine.

314
00:14:20,840 --> 00:14:21,840
 I think the Ford Fiesta.

315
00:14:21,840 --> 00:14:25,720
 I think Ford Fiesta, that's the one that was in my, that's interesting, isn't it?

316
00:14:25,720 --> 00:14:27,720
 It's like when you say "Think of a Car", means like "Asus Bates".

317
00:14:27,720 --> 00:14:30,240
 If you ask a British person to name a car, they'll probably say "Fold Fiesta".

318
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:31,240
 I think so.

319
00:14:31,240 --> 00:14:35,400
 But wasn't like some of the early Volkswagen's, didn't they date back to World War II?

320
00:14:35,400 --> 00:14:36,400
 I don't know.

321
00:14:36,400 --> 00:14:39,440
 Yes, they probably had a bit of a clear out of the Volkswagen's, didn't they?

322
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:40,680
 After the mid-40s?

323
00:14:40,680 --> 00:14:41,680
 I think they--

324
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:42,680
 By association?

325
00:14:42,680 --> 00:14:43,680
 I don't know.

326
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:45,160
 This is a problem that's doing this show with no Google.

327
00:14:45,160 --> 00:14:46,160
 Absolutely.

328
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:47,160
 Yeah.

329
00:14:47,160 --> 00:14:50,000
 I'll do one more here, which was sent in by Chloe Martin.

330
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,880
 She says, "A good Hong Kong fact for you."

331
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:57,640
 Redneck seller Terrace in the Hong Kong mid-levels is so named because the original signwriter

332
00:14:57,640 --> 00:15:02,240
 wrote Alexander Terrace right to left, as in the Chinese way.

333
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:03,240
 Redneck seller.

334
00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:05,240
 Alexander backwards.

335
00:15:05,240 --> 00:15:06,240
 It's Alexander backwards.

336
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:07,520
 Now we've mentioned this on the show.

337
00:15:07,520 --> 00:15:08,520
 We have.

338
00:15:08,520 --> 00:15:11,640
 I've mentioned it because my mum and dad lived on that road.

339
00:15:11,640 --> 00:15:12,640
 Yes.

340
00:15:12,640 --> 00:15:14,800
 It's a friend of the podcast, Redneck's Hello.

341
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:15,800
 Last one?

342
00:15:15,800 --> 00:15:16,800
 Yeah.

343
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:18,400
 Okay, this is from Graeme Wallace.

344
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:23,000
 And Graeme says, "You've covered animal regeneration previously, but this seems to be an extreme

345
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,000
 example.

346
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:31,720
 There are two sea slugs from the species sacco-glossin that can amputate their entire body and then

347
00:15:31,720 --> 00:15:32,720
 come back to life."

348
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:36,520
 Wait, what's left if you've amputated your entire body?

349
00:15:36,520 --> 00:15:37,520
 Your head.

350
00:15:37,520 --> 00:15:38,520
 Head and body.

351
00:15:38,520 --> 00:15:39,520
 Separate.

352
00:15:39,520 --> 00:15:40,520
 Yes.

353
00:15:40,520 --> 00:15:41,960
 Separate your head from your body.

354
00:15:41,960 --> 00:15:43,640
 No more shoulders, knees and toes, though.

355
00:15:43,640 --> 00:15:45,000
 It's a quick game.

356
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,000
 Head.

357
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,000
 Head.

358
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:52,040
 You've got your eyes and your ears and your mouth and your nose too.

359
00:15:52,040 --> 00:15:53,040
 You've got your eyes and your mouth.

360
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:54,040
 Actually, yeah.

361
00:15:54,040 --> 00:15:55,040
 Yeah, yeah.

362
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:57,600
 So here's the thing.

363
00:15:57,600 --> 00:16:01,320
 How do you get the energy to regrow your body if you're only ahead and you don't have

364
00:16:01,320 --> 00:16:02,320
 a digestive system?

365
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:06,000
 I guess you can't travel around to eat because you were using your body for that.

366
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:11,720
 Even if you could eat, food can't digest your digestive system.

367
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:16,480
 I would say small micro-digestive system just in your mouth.

368
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:19,920
 It's kind of, but there's something more.

369
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:26,360
 Do you park the bottom of the hole in your neck on the anus of another slug and take in

370
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:28,600
 the nutrients of what's passed through their body?

371
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:29,600
 Wow, Dan.

372
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:32,520
 I mean, I could imagine that working.

373
00:16:32,520 --> 00:16:33,520
 Nature.

374
00:16:33,520 --> 00:16:34,520
 Wild.

375
00:16:34,520 --> 00:16:35,520
 Yeah.

376
00:16:35,520 --> 00:16:38,640
 But a sea slugs, especially, they are wacky.

377
00:16:38,640 --> 00:16:45,400
 What seems to happen is that they eat some algae and they algae photo-synthesizes creates

378
00:16:45,400 --> 00:16:49,000
 energy and that gives them the energy to then create their body.

379
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,000
 Wow.

380
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,000
 That's insane.

381
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:52,000
 I know.

382
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,000
 That is nature.

383
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,000
 That is, yeah.

384
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,000
 That's as weird as you said, Dan.

385
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:56,000
 Is it?

386
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:59,320
 Yeah, I was going to say is it any weirder than attaching your head onto some wasadas to

387
00:16:59,320 --> 00:17:00,320
 get the nutrient?

388
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:06,960
 It's weirdly like Mary Shelley's Frankenstein monster where it's like electricity was turning,

389
00:17:06,960 --> 00:17:11,720
 like it's creating this kind of zap sense of question over here.

390
00:17:11,720 --> 00:17:16,560
 Actually, I don't think she ever says the galvanising forces electricity in the book.

391
00:17:16,560 --> 00:17:19,960
 No, but in the preface, she does talk about Galvanis experiments.

392
00:17:19,960 --> 00:17:23,960
 Yes, but that's just an example and actually it's very unclear what chemical mechanism is

393
00:17:23,960 --> 00:17:25,960
 used to bring the creature to life.

394
00:17:25,960 --> 00:17:26,960
 Yeah, but I would...

395
00:17:26,960 --> 00:17:27,960
 So I'm just forced to...

396
00:17:27,960 --> 00:17:28,960
 I'm just forced to all of you.

397
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:34,200
 Well, I would have said Frankenstein in that case, but I said Mary Shelley's Frankenstein,

398
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:38,800
 which is the name of the kind of Branagh film.

399
00:17:38,800 --> 00:17:39,800
 In which...

400
00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:40,800
 I...

401
00:17:40,800 --> 00:17:41,800
 Electrocity is used.

402
00:17:41,800 --> 00:17:43,000
 I'm going to cut off my top not right now.

403
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,000
 Very nice.

404
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,000
 Very nice.

405
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:46,000
 Okay.

406
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,000
 Well, this is brilliant.

407
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:48,000
 We love these facts coming in.

408
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,000
 Thank you so much, everyone.

409
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:52,760
 And before we wrap up with this episode, we've got one more important thing to do, which

410
00:17:52,760 --> 00:17:58,560
 is hand out some past headline facts to members of the highest tier friend of the podcast

411
00:17:58,560 --> 00:18:00,120
 of Club Fish.

412
00:18:00,120 --> 00:18:01,800
 So who wants to go first?

413
00:18:01,800 --> 00:18:06,360
 I will.

414
00:18:06,360 --> 00:18:08,520
 This one goes out to Radu Flueras.

415
00:18:08,520 --> 00:18:11,480
 A fantastic name, Radu.

416
00:18:11,480 --> 00:18:17,680
 This is the fact that in medical jargon, lull used to mean little old lady.

417
00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:22,680
 And that meant that other doctor's acronyms included lolinad, little old lady in no apparent

418
00:18:22,680 --> 00:18:27,760
 distress, or lalfa de guber, little old lady fall down go boom.

419
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:34,640
 This is great, this is episode 27, and we had as guest on the show Helen Zoltzman.

420
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:39,400
 It's such a weird one, this kind of medical jargon stuff, because the idea is that doctors

421
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:41,520
 write it on your notes.

422
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:47,680
 And then I saw a really, really believable debunk saying, "You're allowed to get your notes

423
00:18:47,680 --> 00:18:48,680
 now.

424
00:18:48,680 --> 00:18:50,760
 There is absolutely no way that any doctor would do this."

425
00:18:50,760 --> 00:18:53,880
 And a load of doctors saying, "Yeah, it was a thing that happened in the past, but we

426
00:18:53,880 --> 00:18:54,880
 don't do it anymore."

427
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:58,240
 But then I've heard actual doctors say, "Yeah, we do do that."

428
00:18:58,240 --> 00:18:59,720
 We do this all the time.

429
00:18:59,720 --> 00:19:01,360
 So I don't know what to believe.

430
00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:05,560
 In between carving our initials on your liver during sensitive operations.

431
00:19:05,560 --> 00:19:10,400
 Yeah, I think probably, oh, definitely used to happen a fair bit before you could get

432
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:12,120
 your notes quite so easily.

433
00:19:12,120 --> 00:19:15,000
 Yeah, and Helen is, of course, a complete podcasting Don.

434
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:16,000
 Yes.

435
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:17,000
 She's of answer me this.

436
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:18,920
 And the illusionist and all sorts of other shows.

437
00:19:18,920 --> 00:19:23,400
 And I don't think it's too much to say that we were partly inspired to make this show

438
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:24,400
 from Helen.

439
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:25,400
 I'm not 100%.

440
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:28,880
 They showed kind of the potential of what a podcast could be to everyone who was making it

441
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:29,880
 at the time.

442
00:19:29,880 --> 00:19:30,880
 So that was very cool.

443
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:31,880
 We love Helen.

444
00:19:31,880 --> 00:19:32,880
 Okay.

445
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:36,400
 Here is one for Alice Jackson and Alice, your fact.

446
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:39,000
 I'm sorry, it's another down tribe or one.

447
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:40,000
 Only joking.

448
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:41,000
 No, it's great fact.

449
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:46,040
 It is that according to researchers at Glasgow, Caledonian University, listening to Billy

450
00:19:46,040 --> 00:19:52,080
 Connelly can substantially increase your tolerance to pain.

451
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:54,280
 And this is the way that they do this.

452
00:19:54,280 --> 00:19:58,400
 You put your hand in ice for as long as possible.

453
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:01,080
 And you take it out when you can't manage it any longer.

454
00:20:01,080 --> 00:20:02,640
 And they've done a few experiments like this.

455
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:09,360
 The famous one is the one about swearing, which is you could keep your hand in the ice for

456
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:16,080
 longer if you're just going, if you're just going, yeah, if you're just doing a thick

457
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:23,000
 Scottish accent, I can understand what you were saying, the old Ron Brown.

458
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:24,800
 Well congrats to you, Alice.

459
00:20:24,800 --> 00:20:26,120
 That's your fact.

460
00:20:26,120 --> 00:20:27,680
 And now Kate Haymes.

461
00:20:27,680 --> 00:20:28,680
 We have one for you.

462
00:20:28,680 --> 00:20:29,680
 Is it not Haymes?

463
00:20:29,680 --> 00:20:34,240
 No, it's just laughing because do you remember, you called me Haymes for quite a long time?

464
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:35,240
 Hummus.

465
00:20:35,240 --> 00:20:36,240
 Hummus.

466
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:39,240
 But I think one reason was, did I not get mentioned in someone's book?

467
00:20:39,240 --> 00:20:40,240
 Yeah.

468
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:46,200
 You received an acknowledgement in Steve Colgan's book, which was Haymes Harkin, and you became

469
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:47,840
 Haymes for a very long time.

470
00:20:47,840 --> 00:20:48,840
 Yeah.

471
00:20:48,840 --> 00:20:51,120
 So Kate Haymes, this is your fact.

472
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:55,960
 The first woman to cycle the world, learn to ride a bike the day before she set off.

473
00:20:55,960 --> 00:20:58,960
 Is this friend of the podcast, Annie London Derry?

474
00:20:58,960 --> 00:20:59,960
 Annie London Derry.

475
00:20:59,960 --> 00:21:00,960
 Yes.

476
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:08,080
 Who was an amazing world traveling cycling lady, and she was, I think she was about 23 when

477
00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:09,080
 she did it.

478
00:21:09,080 --> 00:21:10,080
 She was so young.

479
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:13,160
 I think she might even have had a husband and children who she might have written out of

480
00:21:13,160 --> 00:21:14,160
 the story.

481
00:21:14,160 --> 00:21:15,160
 She did.

482
00:21:15,160 --> 00:21:17,960
 Which she was selling to the press because she wanted to be like young single cool lady.

483
00:21:17,960 --> 00:21:18,960
 Right.

484
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:19,960
 Get's press attention.

485
00:21:19,960 --> 00:21:22,840
 That's a lot of the story, but there's so much more to it.

486
00:21:22,840 --> 00:21:26,720
 And you can read all about it in the excellent book, Everything to Play for.

487
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:30,280
 The QI Book of Sport by James Harkin and Anna Toshinsky.

488
00:21:30,280 --> 00:21:31,880
 She has a whole chapter about her.

489
00:21:31,880 --> 00:21:32,880
 Yeah.

490
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:33,880
 Oh, you can just go on Wikipedia.

491
00:21:33,880 --> 00:21:34,880
 I mean, it's all out.

492
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:38,520
 Well, you can listen back to episode 27 as well.

493
00:21:38,520 --> 00:21:42,280
 I think we found some stuff that isn't Wikipedia for that.

494
00:21:42,280 --> 00:21:47,160
 We went to the old newspaper archives because she was in the newspapers quite a lot, and

495
00:21:47,160 --> 00:21:52,520
 they gave lots of really amazing stories of when she fell off her bike and all this kind

496
00:21:52,520 --> 00:21:53,520
 of stuff.

497
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:54,520
 Nice.

498
00:21:54,520 --> 00:21:55,680
 And do you think, did she cheat for any bits?

499
00:21:55,680 --> 00:21:57,400
 Obviously, she went on boats over the ocean bits.

500
00:21:57,400 --> 00:21:58,400
 Yeah.

501
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:02,800
 We think that a lot of her stories should be taken with a bit of a pinch of salt.

502
00:22:02,800 --> 00:22:03,800
 Yeah.

503
00:22:03,800 --> 00:22:04,800
 But she was very cool.

504
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:05,800
 Yeah.

505
00:22:05,800 --> 00:22:06,800
 Super cool.

506
00:22:06,800 --> 00:22:07,800
 Very early friend of the podcast.

507
00:22:07,800 --> 00:22:08,800
 One of the first ever friends of the podcast, actually.

508
00:22:08,800 --> 00:22:09,800
 Yeah.

509
00:22:09,800 --> 00:22:10,800
 But she did make it, too.

510
00:22:10,800 --> 00:22:11,800
 We did recently.

511
00:22:11,800 --> 00:22:15,000
 If you're part of the top tier of Club Fish, there is the friend of the podcast

512
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:16,000
 here.

513
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:20,320
 For three months, you get sent a T-shirt, and we have made a friends of the podcast T-shirt,

514
00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:22,880
 which lists all of the greatest friends of the podcast.

515
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:24,280
 And she makes it on there.

516
00:22:24,280 --> 00:22:25,520
 And the London Dairy appears.

517
00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:27,640
 Andy, let's go to you.

518
00:22:27,640 --> 00:22:29,960
 This is a fact that goes to Mark Norman.

519
00:22:29,960 --> 00:22:34,840
 Mark, your fact is that when Californian ground squirrels are attacked by snakes, they increase

520
00:22:34,840 --> 00:22:39,920
 their blood pressure, so their tail gives off more infrared radiation, making them look

521
00:22:39,920 --> 00:22:40,920
 bigger.

522
00:22:40,920 --> 00:22:44,040
 You might be thinking, well, my blood pressure would increase if I was being shredded

523
00:22:44,040 --> 00:22:48,800
 by a rattlesnake, but the really cool thing is they do this with rattlesnakes, which they

524
00:22:48,800 --> 00:22:55,280
 know can see an infrared, even though the squirrel itself can't see an infrared, it knows

525
00:22:55,280 --> 00:22:56,800
 that the snake can.

526
00:22:56,800 --> 00:22:57,800
 It's fascinating.

527
00:22:57,800 --> 00:22:58,960
 And it doesn't do it with other snakes.

528
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:05,920
 So we know it's a deliberate thing because it knows it works, maybe it doesn't know about

529
00:23:05,920 --> 00:23:06,920
 the infrared spectrum.

530
00:23:06,920 --> 00:23:07,920
 Yeah.

531
00:23:07,920 --> 00:23:11,840
 It just does something, and this works against that snake, and they're like, guys, we should

532
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:12,840
 do that again.

533
00:23:12,840 --> 00:23:13,840
 Exactly.

534
00:23:13,840 --> 00:23:15,360
 So that is a fact.

535
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:23,000
 This one goes to JDG, JDG, I don't know what they stand for, but I think the J might be

536
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:25,040
 Joshua looking at your email address.

537
00:23:25,040 --> 00:23:31,200
 But anyway, JDG, this is your fact now, and that is that every day over 100 people used

538
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:35,680
 to watch King Louis the 14th get up and get dressed.

539
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:36,680
 Magnificent.

540
00:23:36,680 --> 00:23:37,680
 Yeah.

541
00:23:37,680 --> 00:23:43,200
 Yeah, that was one of your facts, Andy, and it was a brilliant fact about, yeah, about

542
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:45,600
 how his life was just on display.

543
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:46,600
 Yeah.

544
00:23:46,600 --> 00:23:47,960
 It was called the Revive, wasn't it?

545
00:23:47,960 --> 00:23:52,720
 And people just woke up and, well, they woke up early and then went to watch him wake up, and

546
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:56,080
 then they watched him have his first "we" of the day, and then they watched him get dressed,

547
00:23:56,080 --> 00:23:57,920
 and then they watched him have his breakfast.

548
00:23:57,920 --> 00:23:58,920
 Yes.

549
00:23:58,920 --> 00:24:02,800
 We're actually thinking of launching a higher tier where you can get this kind of access

550
00:24:02,800 --> 00:24:05,880
 to, if anyone registers their interest.

551
00:24:05,880 --> 00:24:06,880
 Yeah.

552
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:07,880
 Very cool.

553
00:24:07,880 --> 00:24:08,880
 I'm going to read out the next one here.

554
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:14,680
 By the way, that last fact was from episode 28, so here's the second one from that episode,

555
00:24:14,680 --> 00:24:19,560
 which is now under the custodianship of Gemma Donald, and it is that there is an original

556
00:24:19,560 --> 00:24:23,640
 Picasso that we will never see because it was eaten by the dog.

557
00:24:23,640 --> 00:24:24,640
 Really nice.

558
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:27,440
 I know he was very prolific, Picasso, wasn't he?

559
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:28,440
 Yeah.

560
00:24:28,440 --> 00:24:35,040
 And he was the one who also did a supposedly did the drawing on a napkin to pay for his

561
00:24:35,040 --> 00:24:36,040
 classes.

562
00:24:36,040 --> 00:24:37,040
 That's right.

563
00:24:37,040 --> 00:24:40,960
 So Mr. Picasso, can you sign it, please, and he said, "No, I want to pay for my coffee,

564
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:41,960
 not the entire cafe."

565
00:24:41,960 --> 00:24:42,960
 Yes.

566
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:45,800
 It was a way to indeed yourself to the staff, isn't it?

567
00:24:45,800 --> 00:24:47,360
 Do you guys ever do this in cafes or restaurants?

568
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:48,360
 I do it all the time.

569
00:24:48,360 --> 00:24:49,360
 Yeah.

570
00:24:49,360 --> 00:24:53,560
 Half of them are sort of a bit of tedious humour, and you know, yeah, get a 10% off.

571
00:24:53,560 --> 00:24:55,560
 So get a 10% off?

572
00:24:55,560 --> 00:24:56,560
 Five?

573
00:24:56,560 --> 00:24:57,560
 Yeah.

574
00:24:57,560 --> 00:24:58,800
 Okay, we'll just take a service, Trump.

575
00:24:58,800 --> 00:24:59,800
 Yeah.

576
00:24:59,800 --> 00:25:00,800
 Thank you very much.

577
00:25:00,800 --> 00:25:04,520
 They've actually added 10% to the bill.

578
00:25:04,520 --> 00:25:05,520
 Time wasting.

579
00:25:05,520 --> 00:25:07,600
 Oh, here's another one.

580
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:08,600
 Yep.

581
00:25:08,600 --> 00:25:11,160
 It goes out to J.F.

582
00:25:11,160 --> 00:25:15,660
 This is the fact is that during the Second World War, the U.S. Navy diving manual contained

583
00:25:15,660 --> 00:25:19,640
 detailed instructions over what to do if eaten by a giant clam.

584
00:25:19,640 --> 00:25:20,640
 Wow.

585
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:21,640
 Yes.

586
00:25:21,640 --> 00:25:22,640
 Yes.

587
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:23,640
 Nice.

588
00:25:23,640 --> 00:25:24,640
 That was one of mine.

589
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:27,400
 I can't remember the details about it now, but it was just in this, I remember seeing

590
00:25:27,400 --> 00:25:28,400
 the images.

591
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:29,400
 Yeah.

592
00:25:29,400 --> 00:25:30,400
 I remember.

593
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:34,640
 And then we looked into it and actually a giant clam isn't strong enough to take an hour

594
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:35,640
 to close.

595
00:25:35,640 --> 00:25:36,640
 Yeah.

596
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:39,960
 And even if it did close, it has little gaps in it and you'd be able to get your foot out

597
00:25:39,960 --> 00:25:40,960
 anyway.

598
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:41,960
 Yeah.

599
00:25:41,960 --> 00:25:42,960
 Just a clam.

600
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:43,960
 Grow up.

601
00:25:43,960 --> 00:25:48,640
 I don't want to be responsible as a podcast for anyone being eaten by a giant clam.

602
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:52,320
 And I'm saying, oh, I'm just going to keep my foot in here for an hour because those things

603
00:25:52,320 --> 00:25:53,320
 are fish set.

604
00:25:53,320 --> 00:25:54,320
 That's the answer easily.

605
00:25:54,320 --> 00:25:55,320
 Wiggle it out.

606
00:25:55,320 --> 00:25:56,320
 I call myself things are fish.

607
00:25:56,320 --> 00:25:58,320
 They know what they're talking about in the underwater realm.

608
00:25:58,320 --> 00:25:59,320
 I find.

609
00:25:59,320 --> 00:26:03,560
 I sort of think it would be cool if we were responsible for that.

610
00:26:03,560 --> 00:26:06,080
 Well, we're trying to get publicity this year, aren't we?

611
00:26:06,080 --> 00:26:08,200
 It's the year of putting ourselves out there.

612
00:26:08,200 --> 00:26:09,200
 They're right.

613
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:13,760
 So I think it's a guessing listeners eating my giant clams is one way of doing it.

614
00:26:13,760 --> 00:26:14,760
 Yeah.

615
00:26:14,760 --> 00:26:15,760
 Is that all the one show?

616
00:26:15,760 --> 00:26:20,720
 I think the problem with that is if we try and get our listenership up by doing away

617
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:25,760
 with our listeners, you know, we have to get two new listeners for the one that we've

618
00:26:25,760 --> 00:26:26,760
 lost.

619
00:26:26,760 --> 00:26:27,760
 Do you know what?

620
00:26:27,760 --> 00:26:28,760
 That's a really good point.

621
00:26:28,760 --> 00:26:29,760
 That's a really good point.

622
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:30,760
 Okay.

623
00:26:30,760 --> 00:26:39,160
 There we go, our latest custodians, congratulations to JF, to Gemma, to JDG, to Mark, Kate, Alice, and

624
00:26:39,160 --> 00:26:40,480
 Radu.

625
00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:42,200
 You are now the custodians of all these facts.

626
00:26:42,200 --> 00:26:46,760
 If you yourself would like to get ownership of one of our facts, all you need to do is join

627
00:26:46,760 --> 00:26:53,520
 the top tier of Clubfish, go to patreon.com/nosuchthing as a fish and not only will you be given

628
00:26:53,520 --> 00:27:00,080
 a shout out on the show, but we will also send you a digital certificate and do with that.

629
00:27:00,080 --> 00:27:01,080
 What you like.

630
00:27:01,080 --> 00:27:03,640
 Anyway, we're going to be back again next week.

631
00:27:03,640 --> 00:27:05,200
 Do keep sending us your facts.

632
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:08,160
 We absolutely love reading them out here on Little Fish.

633
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:12,000
 Otherwise, come join us again on Friday for another regular episode of No Such Thing

634
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:13,000
 as a Fish.

635
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:14,000
 We will see you then.

636
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:15,000
 Goodbye.
