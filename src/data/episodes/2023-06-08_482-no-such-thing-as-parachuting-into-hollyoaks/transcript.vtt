00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.760
 Hi everyone, welcome to this week's episode of No Such Thing as a Fish, where we are joined by one of our favourite, favourite people in the world, Rosie Jones.

00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:17.860
 Now, those of you in the UK will not need to hear an introduction for Rosie, because she is one of the great comedians of our time.

00:00:17.860 --> 00:00:29.040
 Any of you who've watched QI, which I know is a lot of you will recognise her, she's been on all sorts of stuff, so she kind of came into the limelight on the last leg and worked on the Paralympics.

00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:44.760
 You'll hear a lot about that in this show. She's a writer as well, she wrote for the Netflix show Sex Education, she's written a brilliant children's book called The Amazing E.D. Eckhart, which is about an 11 year old with cerebral palsy.

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:53.440
 She's just an all-round, very, very funny person, and I really, really hope you'll enjoy this week's show. I'm absolutely certain you will. It's one of my favourites that we've ever done, I think.

00:00:53.440 --> 00:01:07.760
 If you want to see Rosie in real life, then I think her tour has, I think it's literally just started maybe this week, and if you want to go and see that, you can go to rosyjonescomedy.com and all the dates are up there. Rosie is R-O-S-I-E.

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:13.080
 And that's all to say, really. I really hope you enjoy this show with Rosie, and on with the podcast.

00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:27.480
 [Music]

00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:35.880
 Hello, and welcome to another episode of No Such Thing as a Fish, a weekly podcast coming to you from the QI officers in Hoburn.

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:41.800
 My name is Dan Schreiber, I am sitting here with James Harkin, Andrew Hunter Murray, and Rosie Jones.

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:50.400
 And once again, we have gathered round the microphones with our four favourite facts from the last seven days, and in no particular order, here we go.

00:01:50.400 --> 00:02:04.800
 Starting with fact number one, that is my fact. My fact this week is that the world's greatest Paralympic equestrian, with 14 gold medals under his belt, is also allergic to horses.

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:11.000
 That's not his Paralympic qualification, that's not the disability that means, okay, okay.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:25.800
 Absolutely, no, it's not. So yeah, this is an extraordinary guy called Lee Pearson, who has over the years won 14 gold medals, a bunch of bronze and silver along the way as well, and he's just an amazing character, generally.

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:32.000
 I mean, I want to, I'll mention a couple of things, I'm really excited to ask whether or not you've met him, because I know you've been to the Paralympics, right?

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:46.200
 But so he's the kind of guy who says like my training is curry, Malibu and Coke, and, you know, and he loves to party, and he's got a life story, which is, you know, he was born and put into a broom cupboard as soon as he was born.

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:50.200
 We've got to say, okay, we've got to, yeah, can I unpick this?

00:02:50.200 --> 00:03:03.000
 So he was born with a condition which I'd never heard of before, it's called a thyrogryposis multiplex congenitor. I think I've said that right. I think that was known when he was born, and he wasn't looked after especially well by the hospital he was in.

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:15.000
 So he was put into a cupboard for a few days in a sort of crib thing, and his mum was heavily sedated so that they didn't know she was trying to find out where he was when she eventually, you know, came around.

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:26.800
 And as a result, he has no muscles in his arms. So he does, he does the dressage with his shoulders. That's what he pulls with to control. And he got into horse riding because he couldn't ride a bike. So that's the, that's the basics.

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:28.800
 Is he, sorry, is he British or is he?

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:38.800
 He is, yeah, he's also gay. And as a result, the headline on the story that I read was out of two closets and into Paralympic history.

00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:54.600
 That's amazing. But so just to end the broom cupboard story is that he he's left there for three days. Finally, the dad comes to visit the mum is where's my baby and they go find the baby and they half kind of think they're going to find a dying baby, but he's doing okay.

00:03:54.600 --> 00:04:02.600
 And the mum has to play it cool because for some reason she just wanted to not make a big deal out of it, worrying that they might then take him away because of her emotion.

00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:16.600
 And so, yeah. And so he should have died according to the nurses. So his life story from the get go is just a phenomenal moment. And he was kind of a young kid who experienced a lot of interesting moments along the way.

00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:29.600
 Like there's a story that Margaret Thatcher carried up the staircase at 10 Downing Street when he was being presented an award when he was six years old for children of courage. So he's always been sort of in the limelight and he's a huge advocate of gay.

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:42.600
 Thatcher is needs. Yeah. But yeah, he's, you know, when when the Paralympics were going to be happening in Russia, he wanted to go and explicitly talk about gay rights.

00:04:42.600 --> 00:05:05.600
 It's a really cool guy, he seems. He is amazing. And yeah, I've met him because I've been to two Paralympics now because before I was a comedian, I was a researcher in telly.

00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:27.600
 So in 2016, I went to Rio to work on the last leg. And then in 2021, I went to Tokyo again with the last leg.

00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:47.600
 But this time, I was on telly. So I was the correspondent out there and they tell me to shut up because it's not a fact.

00:05:47.600 --> 00:06:10.600
 And but I just wanted to say how both the time to get into the Paralympics, I've had incredible emotional journeys because I've been disabled all my life.

00:06:10.600 --> 00:06:35.600
 I don't mind it. I love the life and the world I created, but it can be exhausting going into rooms all day every day when you're normally the only disabled person.

00:06:35.600 --> 00:06:50.600
 So you get this disabled paradise where actually, if you're able-bodied, you look weird.

00:06:50.600 --> 00:07:03.600
 It's such an emotional feeling to know that we're not alone and we're in this all together.

00:07:03.600 --> 00:07:18.600
 But what I wanted to say was, I met Lee at both games and he is brilliant.

00:07:18.600 --> 00:07:39.600
 We once interviewed him and he was naked in bed. Like, he did not care. It just sounds so cool. I love that he learned to ride on horses, not on the horse, but on a donkey.

00:07:39.600 --> 00:07:43.600
 That was his first experience. A donkey called Sally.

00:07:43.600 --> 00:07:51.600
 In ancient China, no, not ancient China, but early modern China, the women polo players would play on donkeys.

00:07:51.600 --> 00:07:55.600
 So the male polo players would play on horses and the women would play on donkeys.

00:07:55.600 --> 00:08:04.600
 And it was because it's quite a high status thing. It was like very posh people who would play and they just thought it was safer really because you're closer to the ground.

00:08:04.600 --> 00:08:11.600
 And I guess that's why you practice to do your equestrian on donkeys as well because they're slower and closer to the ground.

00:08:11.600 --> 00:08:18.600
 Yeah, there is a lot of horse allergy in Paralympic athletes, horse riding athletes.

00:08:18.600 --> 00:08:23.600
 Yeah, there's Sophie Wells. She won silver in 2012. She's allergic to horses.

00:08:23.600 --> 00:08:30.600
 But I read that and I read an article with her that said because she was allergic to horses, her mother had to brush down the pony when she was a child.

00:08:30.600 --> 00:08:36.600
 It does sound to me like she's like, "Oh, no, I can't muck her out. I can't brush her down. I'm allergic."

00:08:36.600 --> 00:08:41.600
 I'm also allergic to dutch.

00:08:41.600 --> 00:08:43.600
 Making birds, I can't.

00:08:43.600 --> 00:08:49.600
 The other thing about her, Sophie Wells, is she went to school at somewhere called the Robert Pattinson Academy.

00:08:49.600 --> 00:08:51.600
 Really?

00:08:51.600 --> 00:08:52.600
 No.

00:08:52.600 --> 00:08:53.600
 Isn't that amazing?

00:08:53.600 --> 00:08:55.600
 Only open at Twilight.

00:08:55.600 --> 00:09:01.600
 And it's named after Sir Robert Pattinson, who was an MP for Grantham in the 1920s.

00:09:01.600 --> 00:09:03.600
 Margaret Thatcher's old constituency.

00:09:03.600 --> 00:09:08.600
 The wrong link between Paralympic dressage and Margaret Thatcher.

00:09:08.600 --> 00:09:11.600
 Sophie Wells, the rival of Sophie Wells. So Sophie Wells won silver in 2012.

00:09:11.600 --> 00:09:14.600
 Her rival who took gold was called Michael George.

00:09:14.600 --> 00:09:16.600
 Now, if my surname was Michael...

00:09:16.600 --> 00:09:21.600
 No, if my surname was George and I had a son, I'm not sure I'd call him Michael.

00:09:21.600 --> 00:09:22.600
 Why?

00:09:22.600 --> 00:09:24.600
 Because it's George Michael's.

00:09:24.600 --> 00:09:27.600
 I was two fast names, but I'm thinking it's like a George Michael reference.

00:09:27.600 --> 00:09:30.600
 If they stood next to each other, they'd be a palindrome.

00:09:30.600 --> 00:09:33.600
 You didn't pick up on someone called Michael George having a name like George Michael?

00:09:33.600 --> 00:09:34.600
 No.

00:09:34.600 --> 00:09:35.600
 I didn't.

00:09:35.600 --> 00:09:36.600
 No.

00:09:36.600 --> 00:09:37.600
 Am I the only one here?

00:09:37.600 --> 00:09:38.600
 No, I didn't.

00:09:38.600 --> 00:09:39.600
 Oh, thank you.

00:09:39.600 --> 00:09:40.600
 It was the first thing I saw.

00:09:40.600 --> 00:09:48.600
 I first thought was what Tory MP is.

00:09:48.600 --> 00:09:51.600
 It was Ian Thatcher's cabinet.

00:09:51.600 --> 00:09:54.600
 I went to the Sydney Paralympics.

00:09:54.600 --> 00:09:55.600
 Did you?

00:09:55.600 --> 00:09:56.600
 Yeah, it was awesome.

00:09:56.600 --> 00:09:57.600
 I don't actually have much memory.

00:09:57.600 --> 00:10:01.600
 We sat in Homebush, which is the big stadium that was built for it.

00:10:01.600 --> 00:10:05.600
 The Paralympics wasn't a big deal in the country.

00:10:05.600 --> 00:10:07.600
 The Olympics was such a big deal.

00:10:07.600 --> 00:10:08.600
 It was the year 2000.

00:10:08.600 --> 00:10:13.600
 And I remember on the day, my impressions of it were the stadium was virtually empty.

00:10:13.600 --> 00:10:16.600
 It was a lot of school excursions, which is what we were on.

00:10:16.600 --> 00:10:18.600
 And the music that they were playing over the sound system.

00:10:18.600 --> 00:10:23.600
 And these are all people are doing their big Olympic events were kids' songs like "Row, Row, Row Your Boat" and stuff.

00:10:23.600 --> 00:10:28.600
 And I just remember thinking, is that during the rowing event?

00:10:28.600 --> 00:10:29.600
 Good motivation.

00:10:29.600 --> 00:10:33.600
 But I just remember sitting there thinking, these are professional athletes who've spent

00:10:33.600 --> 00:10:35.600
 four years getting to this point.

00:10:35.600 --> 00:10:36.600
 And they've got nursery rhymes play.

00:10:36.600 --> 00:10:37.600
 It was really odd.

00:10:37.600 --> 00:10:42.600
 And now it's kind of like the opening closing ceremonies will have cold play and they'll

00:10:42.600 --> 00:10:43.600
 have Michael George.

00:10:43.600 --> 00:10:44.600
 Michael George?

00:10:44.600 --> 00:10:51.600
 Doing Whisper Curlis.

00:10:51.600 --> 00:11:01.600
 The first Paralympic Games were in Rome in 1960.

00:11:01.600 --> 00:11:11.600
 And they had a few games that unfortunately no longer happened.

00:11:11.600 --> 00:11:26.600
 My favorite was a sport called "Darchery" which is exactly what it sounds like.

00:11:26.600 --> 00:11:29.600
 It was archery.

00:11:29.600 --> 00:11:31.600
 In a pub.

00:11:31.600 --> 00:11:48.600
 That's a great idea.

00:11:48.600 --> 00:11:56.600
 But what's crazy is archery has a very big, effectively a large dartboard, doesn't it?

00:11:56.600 --> 00:11:59.600
 So that's making archery 10 times harder.

00:11:59.600 --> 00:12:03.600
 And suddenly your place of aim is a dartboard.

00:12:03.600 --> 00:12:05.600
 That's, oh yeah.

00:12:05.600 --> 00:12:07.600
 You've got less surface area for...

00:12:07.600 --> 00:12:09.600
 Was it the size of a dartboard?

00:12:09.600 --> 00:12:10.600
 I think so.

00:12:10.600 --> 00:12:12.600
 I thought it was literally a dartboard.

00:12:12.600 --> 00:12:16.600
 If your normal arrow for an archery, if you find that it's something the size of a dartboard,

00:12:16.600 --> 00:12:19.600
 it's going to go in numerous different numbers at the same time.

00:12:19.600 --> 00:12:20.600
 That's what I was confused about.

00:12:20.600 --> 00:12:22.600
 But you've raised a really good point.

00:12:22.600 --> 00:12:23.600
 What if it was bigger?

00:12:23.600 --> 00:12:28.600
 I was reading about visually impaired skiing, which I think is amazing.

00:12:28.600 --> 00:12:32.600
 Because you're skiing down, and then there's someone else who's skiing in front of you,

00:12:32.600 --> 00:12:35.600
 and they're attached by Bluetooth.

00:12:35.600 --> 00:12:38.600
 So they're telling you what's coming all the way down.

00:12:38.600 --> 00:12:40.600
 And then you have to ski behind them.

00:12:40.600 --> 00:12:42.600
 Wait, so they're not attached physically?

00:12:42.600 --> 00:12:43.600
 They're not physically attached.

00:12:43.600 --> 00:12:45.600
 They're a guide, and they have like headphones.

00:12:45.600 --> 00:12:51.600
 But like, how hard is it to attach your headphones to your phone by a Bluetooth?

00:12:51.600 --> 00:12:56.600
 That must be terrifying to just like your Bluetooth is now disconnected.

00:12:56.600 --> 00:12:57.600
 Oh fuck!

00:12:57.600 --> 00:12:59.600
 What if you then connect to someone else?

00:12:59.600 --> 00:13:01.600
 Getting the wrong info.

00:13:01.600 --> 00:13:06.600
 I just think that must be absolutely terrifying.

00:13:06.600 --> 00:13:12.600
 Visual impairment is such an interesting territory about how there's assists just for that tiny bit of guidance.

00:13:12.600 --> 00:13:16.600
 So for swimming, there's a thing called the tapper, where when you're coming,

00:13:16.600 --> 00:13:20.600
 they'll tap a swimmer on the head to let them know that the end is coming up.

00:13:20.600 --> 00:13:27.600
 And it's so basically as the swimmer, who is visually impaired, you can just swim at full pelt,

00:13:27.600 --> 00:13:31.600
 and you'll know that the end's coming up, so you don't have this uncertainty ahead of you.

00:13:31.600 --> 00:13:33.600
 But I think that has a big responsibility on the tapper.

00:13:33.600 --> 00:13:34.600
 Absolutely.

00:13:34.600 --> 00:13:36.600
 You've got to get that in one.

00:13:36.600 --> 00:13:37.600
 You've got to get that bag on it.

00:13:37.600 --> 00:13:40.600
 And you have to agree what the thing is before you start the race.

00:13:40.600 --> 00:13:41.600
 What the distance is.

00:13:41.600 --> 00:13:42.600
 I'm sure they do, Andy.

00:13:42.600 --> 00:13:44.600
 I'm starting to not just wing it.

00:13:44.600 --> 00:13:49.600
 So I'm going to try and tap you one centimetre before the edge of the...

00:13:49.600 --> 00:13:50.600
 ...the edge of the ear.

00:13:50.600 --> 00:13:59.600
 But you laugh, but there was an incredible swim in Rio,

00:13:59.600 --> 00:14:02.600
 and it had no arms.

00:14:02.600 --> 00:14:03.600
 Oh, yes.

00:14:03.600 --> 00:14:05.600
 And no legs.

00:14:05.600 --> 00:14:17.600
 And his way of stopping in the pool was literally to hit the head.

00:14:17.600 --> 00:14:20.600
 So good.

00:14:20.600 --> 00:14:27.600
 By the end of it, it must have a brain damage as well.

00:14:27.600 --> 00:14:29.600
 Was he wearing like a helmet or something?

00:14:29.600 --> 00:14:30.600
 No.

00:14:30.600 --> 00:14:31.600
 Oh my God.

00:14:31.600 --> 00:14:32.600
 No.

00:14:32.600 --> 00:14:33.600
 That's amazing.

00:14:33.600 --> 00:14:43.600
 Also, what I love about the Paralympics is all the different groups.

00:14:43.600 --> 00:14:44.600
 Yes.

00:14:44.600 --> 00:14:52.600
 There's a million groups and a group on ability,

00:14:52.600 --> 00:15:00.600
 and I think that's why I love it more than the Olympics,

00:15:00.600 --> 00:15:10.600
 because you know that everyone in that race is the same sort of ability.

00:15:10.600 --> 00:15:11.600
 Oh, yeah.

00:15:11.600 --> 00:15:13.600
 I didn't know about the classification thing.

00:15:13.600 --> 00:15:16.600
 And it's why there are so many events, as it were,

00:15:16.600 --> 00:15:21.600
 because you've got ten classes of disability from the least to the most impaired.

00:15:21.600 --> 00:15:31.600
 Well, yeah, but you get different classes of swimming, different classes of running.

00:15:31.600 --> 00:15:45.600
 You just need it because you cannot have a visually impaired person next to an amputee.

00:15:45.600 --> 00:15:49.600
 You can't have someone with no arms and legs against someone who's allergic to horses.

00:15:49.600 --> 00:15:53.600
 But I think it's right that so within class seven or whatever it is,

00:15:53.600 --> 00:15:55.600
 there will be different kinds of impairment.

00:15:55.600 --> 00:15:58.600
 So you might have someone who's got a limb which is shorter

00:15:58.600 --> 00:16:00.600
 or someone who's got impaired muscle power,

00:16:00.600 --> 00:16:02.600
 or someone who's shorter,

00:16:02.600 --> 00:16:06.600
 but they have been assessed as being the same level of impairment.

00:16:06.600 --> 00:16:09.600
 And what it means to the winner is whoever's the best on the day.

00:16:09.600 --> 00:16:10.600
 Yeah.

00:16:10.600 --> 00:16:16.600
 I like to set up rivalry with rivalry.

00:16:16.600 --> 00:16:27.600
 So obviously the Paralympics countries compete in against each other.

00:16:27.600 --> 00:16:35.600
 But when I went to Tokyo, I set up Team CP.

00:16:35.600 --> 00:16:44.600
 So I only supported people with cerebral palsy.

00:16:44.600 --> 00:16:56.600
 And if there was anyone with, like, ME, I'd be like, "Get away! You're not, I grew!"

00:16:56.600 --> 00:16:59.600
 I think it's the spirit of the Paralympics really right there.

00:16:59.600 --> 00:17:06.600
 What visually impaired person?

00:17:06.600 --> 00:17:17.600
 Okay, it is time for fact number two, and that is Rosie.

00:17:17.600 --> 00:17:38.600
 A man from Yorkshire once changed his name by default to Yorkshire Bank PLC, a fascist bastard.

00:17:38.600 --> 00:17:41.600
 Lovely!

00:17:41.600 --> 00:17:46.600
 Now, for avoidance of that, we're not saying that Yorkshire Bank PLC are fascist bastards.

00:17:46.600 --> 00:17:51.600
 No, they don't know one man saying that.

00:17:51.600 --> 00:18:00.600
 And his name is Yorkshire Bank fascist bastard.

00:18:00.600 --> 00:18:03.600
 So are we going to call him Mr Bastards?

00:18:03.600 --> 00:18:13.600
 Well actually, a brother to his friends is known as Yorkshire.

00:18:13.600 --> 00:18:21.600
 Has he stuck with it?

00:18:21.600 --> 00:18:37.600
 I tried to look and I can't find it, but I like to think that Yorkshire's out there enjoying Yorkshire and hating Yorkshire Bank.

00:18:37.600 --> 00:18:45.600
 I reckon he's probably now called, like, United Utilities of Fascist Bastards, or, you know, the Royal Mail of Fascist Bastards.

00:18:45.600 --> 00:18:47.600
 He probably just keeps doing it.

00:18:47.600 --> 00:18:50.600
 Because actually, he's changed his name to, what, that six words.

00:18:50.600 --> 00:18:54.600
 So four of those are middle names, so he will look like he's just called Yorkshire Bastards.

00:18:54.600 --> 00:18:56.600
 Well, we don't know if Fascist Bastards is a double bound.

00:18:56.600 --> 00:18:58.600
 Oh yeah, it could be.

00:18:58.600 --> 00:19:02.600
 I always picture this going to a depot, because I need to change my name to something...

00:19:02.600 --> 00:19:05.600
 Let's say a lot of actors do it right, where a name's taken, so they pick something quite normal,

00:19:05.600 --> 00:19:08.600
 and you're standing in the queue, and the person in front of you is like, oh, what are you changing it to?

00:19:08.600 --> 00:19:11.600
 And you're like, oh, Yorkshire Bank of Fascist Bastards?

00:19:11.600 --> 00:19:14.600
 Oh, that's pretty cool. Guy behind you. What are you changing it to?

00:19:14.600 --> 00:19:17.600
 Oh, you know, Rainbow Sunshine, Lollipops. Oh, god damn it.

00:19:17.600 --> 00:19:19.600
 And I imagine I would just keep coming out with a different name.

00:19:19.600 --> 00:19:22.600
 I'd buckle under, like, the influence.

00:19:22.600 --> 00:19:24.600
 Because you came in just to call yourself Don Shriver.

00:19:24.600 --> 00:19:26.600
 Yeah, exactly. I'm not a Don Shriver.

00:19:26.600 --> 00:19:30.600
 I'm leading as Indiana Jones, Platypus, Orange Man, whatever.

00:19:30.600 --> 00:19:43.600
 I've got an idea. I think after this, we should all go and change our names to a job.

00:19:43.600 --> 00:19:44.600
 Oh, that's a great idea.

00:19:44.600 --> 00:19:47.600
 I don't mind being Rosie Jones. A lot more work.

00:19:47.600 --> 00:19:51.600
 His real name was Michael Howard.

00:19:51.600 --> 00:19:52.600
 Yeah.

00:19:52.600 --> 00:19:54.600
 The ex-conservative leader.

00:19:54.600 --> 00:19:56.600
 Was Howard big in the 90s?

00:19:56.600 --> 00:19:58.600
 Huge. Yeah, I don't know.

00:19:58.600 --> 00:20:02.600
 That was when he was a minister, because the conservatives were in government at the time.

00:20:02.600 --> 00:20:03.600
 So, yeah, he was a big deal at the time.

00:20:03.600 --> 00:20:07.600
 So extra incentive to change from Michael Howard if you didn't want to be.

00:20:07.600 --> 00:20:12.600
 But the report from the time is so good, because he asked for his balance at the bank,

00:20:12.600 --> 00:20:16.600
 69 pence, to be returned to him by check.

00:20:16.600 --> 00:20:18.600
 And a spokeswoman for the bank had to say,

00:20:18.600 --> 00:20:23.600
 "The relationship with Mr. Howard has irretrievably broken down, and we very much regret that."

00:20:23.600 --> 00:20:26.600
 And he said, "Sorry, who do you talk to? Mr. Howard, who's he?"

00:20:26.600 --> 00:20:28.600
 Conservatively, no.

00:20:28.600 --> 00:20:32.600
 I love Rosie. The link you sent over was from a Guardian article, which was called

00:20:32.600 --> 00:20:36.600
 "It's a Funny Old World, 1999," and this was published in November.

00:20:36.600 --> 00:20:39.600
 And just the other examples are there, just to read one or two of them.

00:20:39.600 --> 00:20:41.600
 There was this great one in Sydney.

00:20:41.600 --> 00:20:47.600
 120 men named Henry attacked each other during a "My name is Henry" convention.

00:20:47.600 --> 00:20:52.600
 Henry Panty of Canberra accused Henry Pap of Sydney of not being a Henry at all.

00:20:52.600 --> 00:20:54.600
 But in fact, an Angus.

00:20:54.600 --> 00:20:57.600
 "It was a lie," explained Mr. Pap. "I'm a Henry, and always will be."

00:20:57.600 --> 00:21:03.600
 Whereupon Henry Pap attacked Henry Panty, whilst two other Henrys, Jones and Dyer, attempted to pull them apart.

00:21:03.600 --> 00:21:06.600
 Several more Henrys, Smith, Calderwood and Andrews, became involved,

00:21:06.600 --> 00:21:10.600
 and soon the entire convention descended into a giant fist fight.

00:21:10.600 --> 00:21:12.600
 I want to have a hoovered up after that.

00:21:12.600 --> 00:21:19.600
 The final line, the brawl was eventually broken up by riot police, led by a man named...

00:21:19.600 --> 00:21:22.600
 - Henry! - Shane.

00:21:22.600 --> 00:21:24.600
 Well, he was Australian.

00:21:24.600 --> 00:21:26.600
 Rosie, you're from Yorkshire, aren't you?

00:21:26.600 --> 00:21:32.600
 Yes. I'm proud of Yorkshire Lady,

00:21:32.600 --> 00:21:41.600
 and I think we get a reputation of being tight bats.

00:21:41.600 --> 00:21:47.600
 But I wanted to call me and say,

00:21:47.600 --> 00:21:54.600
 actually, that reputation isn't even true,

00:21:54.600 --> 00:22:06.600
 because I was a survey done that said more than 60% of Yorkshire folks

00:22:06.600 --> 00:22:23.600
 never use a rubber draft, and 3/4 of people from Yorkshire put up to £200 a month aside.

00:22:23.600 --> 00:22:30.600
 So we forgot the money going on.

00:22:30.600 --> 00:22:33.600
 Wait, are you Yorkshire ambassador? Are you trying to change...

00:22:33.600 --> 00:22:35.600
 - Yes. - Is that where you're here?

00:22:35.600 --> 00:22:40.600
 - On the agenda. - Yeah, come table or dinner.

00:22:40.600 --> 00:22:42.600
 All that says to me, Rosie,

00:22:42.600 --> 00:22:44.600
 if they're not going into their overdraft and they're saving money,

00:22:44.600 --> 00:22:47.600
 is that they're not spending any money on it.

00:22:47.600 --> 00:22:51.600
 There's a weird fact I found which kind of combines the name-changers and the money thing.

00:22:51.600 --> 00:22:54.600
 So is it pronounced Connysborough in Yorkshire?

00:22:54.600 --> 00:22:55.600
 - Yeah. - Connysborough, okay.

00:22:55.600 --> 00:22:58.600
 So there's a place in Yorkshire called Connysborough,

00:22:58.600 --> 00:23:01.600
 which has a road in it, which is called Butthole Road.

00:23:01.600 --> 00:23:06.600
 - Okay. - Lovely.

00:23:06.600 --> 00:23:08.600
 They didn't love it.

00:23:08.600 --> 00:23:11.600
 It was probably named after a water butt that used to be in the road.

00:23:11.600 --> 00:23:16.600
 I mean, perfectly innocent, normal, not funny, you know, but three words, Butthole Road.

00:23:16.600 --> 00:23:18.600
 - I don't know if that wasn't funny. - I know, I know.

00:23:18.600 --> 00:23:21.600
 Well, the thing is, they were getting a lot of prank calls.

00:23:21.600 --> 00:23:25.600
 They were getting tourists turning up with their arses out and that kind of stuff.

00:23:25.600 --> 00:23:28.600
 Taxi drivers point blank refused to believe it was a rickshaw.

00:23:28.600 --> 00:23:31.600
 They wouldn't take you there. There were tour buses turning.

00:23:31.600 --> 00:23:36.600
 I mean, it was quite quiet tours, I guess, but...

00:23:36.600 --> 00:23:42.600
 One family actually sold up and moved in 2003 because they were so annoyed about the jokes.

00:23:42.600 --> 00:23:45.600
 The new owner of the house, Peter Sutton, said he knows what to expect

00:23:45.600 --> 00:23:47.600
 and he's looking forward to moving in.

00:23:47.600 --> 00:23:49.600
 (LAUGHTER)

00:23:49.600 --> 00:23:51.600
 - Yeah, dude. - I know.

00:23:51.600 --> 00:23:57.600
 It's very sadly for our purposes, they changed the name of the street.

00:23:57.600 --> 00:24:00.600
 - 2009 to Archer's Way. - That's what.

00:24:00.600 --> 00:24:01.600
 (LAUGHTER)

00:24:01.600 --> 00:24:04.600
 But the council refused to replace the street sign for free,

00:24:04.600 --> 00:24:07.600
 which I don't know if that plays into the other Yorkshire stereotype.

00:24:07.600 --> 00:24:09.600
 (LAUGHTER)

00:24:09.600 --> 00:24:14.600
 Also, there's a village that I've never been to,

00:24:14.600 --> 00:24:21.600
 but I see signs for it called the Land of Nod.

00:24:21.600 --> 00:24:24.600
 - Really? The Land of Nod? - Yeah.

00:24:24.600 --> 00:24:27.600
 - That's quite nice. - It's in the Bible, isn't the Land of Nod?

00:24:27.600 --> 00:24:30.600
 It's the place east of Eden where they get sent off to, I think...

00:24:30.600 --> 00:24:32.600
 - Really? - There's lots of houses around the Bible.

00:24:32.600 --> 00:24:35.600
 - Is that where they call it God's Own Country? - Yorkshire?

00:24:35.600 --> 00:24:37.600
 - Yeah. - No, it's because they're deluded.

00:24:37.600 --> 00:24:39.600
 - Oh, sorry. - OK.

00:24:39.600 --> 00:24:43.600
 - Oh, I'm starting jumping now. - I'm from Lancashire, sorry.

00:24:43.600 --> 00:24:45.600
 - Yeah, do you have rivalries? - Oh, yeah.

00:24:45.600 --> 00:24:47.600
 - Oh, yeah. - Oh, yeah.

00:24:47.600 --> 00:24:50.600
 - Have you heard of a little thing called the Wars of the Roses?

00:24:50.600 --> 00:24:53.600
 - Because... - OK.

00:24:53.600 --> 00:24:56.600
 - It's still ongoing. - Yeah.

00:24:56.600 --> 00:25:02.600
 Actually, my mum and dad are from Lancashire.

00:25:02.600 --> 00:25:04.600
 - Are they? Oh, you're not... - No.

00:25:04.600 --> 00:25:07.600
 - Peace offering has occurred so quickly. - Yeah.

00:25:07.600 --> 00:25:10.600
 - Sorry, Rosie, so you're from Bridlington, right? - Yeah.

00:25:10.600 --> 00:25:13.600
 They have 21 fish and chip takeaways

00:25:13.600 --> 00:25:17.600
 within a five-minute walk of the centre of Bridlington, right?

00:25:17.600 --> 00:25:22.600
 And I call that a challenge.

00:25:22.600 --> 00:25:24.600
 The problem is you have so much fish and chips

00:25:24.600 --> 00:25:27.600
 that also means you have a lot of seagulls, right?

00:25:27.600 --> 00:25:30.600
 I was reading the Bridlington Echo,

00:25:30.600 --> 00:25:34.600
 and it's a recurring story about the problems with seagulls.

00:25:34.600 --> 00:25:37.600
 The Royal Mail had to warn residents

00:25:37.600 --> 00:25:39.600
 that they wouldn't be getting their postal deliveries

00:25:39.600 --> 00:25:42.600
 because seagulls kept attacking postal workers.

00:25:42.600 --> 00:25:44.600
 - Oh, wow. - And there was a bank that was closed

00:25:44.600 --> 00:25:48.600
 because nesting seagulls had caused a leak in the roof.

00:25:48.600 --> 00:25:52.600
 And the Bridlington Fire Station had to rescue a stranded seagull

00:25:52.600 --> 00:25:56.600
 after it sat on top of a metal lamp post for too long in the winter.

00:25:56.600 --> 00:25:58.600
 - So it's, you know... - Wait, did it get...

00:25:58.600 --> 00:26:01.600
 Sorry, just to burrow down into that one a bit.

00:26:01.600 --> 00:26:03.600
 - Was it frozen onto the... - I'm afraid...

00:26:03.600 --> 00:26:05.600
 You know, like when you put your tongue on a metal...

00:26:05.600 --> 00:26:08.600
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. - Well, apparently, if you're a seagull,

00:26:08.600 --> 00:26:10.600
 - it works with your feet as well. - Oh, no.

00:26:10.600 --> 00:26:13.600
 - How do they rescue it? - Well, with the tongue,

00:26:13.600 --> 00:26:15.600
 you usually pour, like, lukewarm water.

00:26:15.600 --> 00:26:18.600
 - Yeah, yeah. - Imagine they did something similar.

00:26:18.600 --> 00:26:22.600
 - Yeah, definitely, yeah. - I think they're so great,

00:26:22.600 --> 00:26:27.600
 but I think what that shows some more than anything

00:26:27.600 --> 00:26:33.600
 is shit all happens in Bridlington.

00:26:33.600 --> 00:26:35.600
 - Yeah. - Well, there was a big story recently.

00:26:35.600 --> 00:26:38.600
 A woman called Susan Radford, she was a grandma,

00:26:38.600 --> 00:26:41.600
 and she spoke out against sexually explicit sweets

00:26:41.600 --> 00:26:44.600
 that were on sale on the seafront.

00:26:44.600 --> 00:26:46.600
 - Do we have any examples? - Yeah, come on.

00:26:46.600 --> 00:26:49.600
 - Well, you know, like rock, like solid sugar? - Yeah, stick a rock.

00:26:49.600 --> 00:26:52.600
 - Oh, you mean, like, the shape of it? - In the shape of...

00:26:52.600 --> 00:26:56.600
 - Oh, what? - Of penises, Rosie.

00:26:56.600 --> 00:27:00.600
 - Oh, yeah, yeah. What do you think?

00:27:00.600 --> 00:27:04.600
 - I knew! I knew!

00:27:04.600 --> 00:27:07.600
 - And she was so upset that she's...

00:27:07.600 --> 00:27:10.600
 She got in touch with the local Anglican church

00:27:10.600 --> 00:27:12.600
 to help her complaint,

00:27:12.600 --> 00:27:15.600
 and she said she's not going to visit Bridlington again

00:27:15.600 --> 00:27:18.600
 until they get rid of the rocks. - She's not from Bridlington.

00:27:18.600 --> 00:27:21.600
 - No? She just went on a holiday one day, saw them,

00:27:21.600 --> 00:27:23.600
 and went, "I'm not coming back here again."

00:27:23.600 --> 00:27:24.600
 - Wow. - Good!

00:27:24.600 --> 00:27:27.600
 We don't need her!

00:27:27.600 --> 00:27:31.600
 - I saw a couple of articles where it said Bridlington

00:27:31.600 --> 00:27:34.600
 voted one of the worst towns in the UK and stuff,

00:27:34.600 --> 00:27:37.600
 but everyone who then went to ride up on it came out going,

00:27:37.600 --> 00:27:39.600
 "It's awesome here. What are you talking about?"

00:27:39.600 --> 00:27:42.600
 Who said that this was bad? I haven't been myself, so I don't know.

00:27:42.600 --> 00:27:44.600
 But the pictures, it looks kind of pretty.

00:27:44.600 --> 00:27:54.600
 - I mean, I think Bridlington is very good if you're under five

00:27:54.600 --> 00:27:58.600
 and you're over 85. - Right, okay.

00:27:58.600 --> 00:28:02.600
 - In between, there's not a lot to do.

00:28:02.600 --> 00:28:06.600
 - It's a pretty rough message to hear on your sixth birthday in Bridlington.

00:28:06.600 --> 00:28:12.600
 - Get out now, Friday, get out!

00:28:12.600 --> 00:28:15.600
 - Can I quickly tell you a couple of Yorkshire world records?

00:28:15.600 --> 00:28:18.600
 - Yes. - Very proud Yorkshire world records.

00:28:18.600 --> 00:28:22.600
 Fastest time to make a litre of ice cream, which was 10 seconds.

00:28:22.600 --> 00:28:24.600
 - Wow. - Andrew Ross.

00:28:24.600 --> 00:28:27.600
 But the ingredients did include liquid nitrogen, so I feel like there was some...

00:28:27.600 --> 00:28:29.600
 - Yeah. - Cheat.

00:28:29.600 --> 00:28:33.600
 - Yeah. World's loudest clap.

00:28:33.600 --> 00:28:38.600
 - Okay. - Are we talking about the action?

00:28:38.600 --> 00:28:43.600
 - We're not talking about the disease.

00:28:43.600 --> 00:28:46.600
 So painful you could hear him screaming for miles.

00:28:46.600 --> 00:28:48.600
 "I've got the clap!"

00:28:48.600 --> 00:28:54.600
 - No, I once read, I don't know if this is true, that the name "the clap" came...

00:28:54.600 --> 00:29:00.600
 This is awful, that they used to put your penis between two pieces of wood

00:29:00.600 --> 00:29:05.600
 and then whack them together and it would get the discharge out of the...

00:29:05.600 --> 00:29:10.600
 - Right, we're talking about a seven-year-old girl here, so I hope you're all very proud of yourselves.

00:29:10.600 --> 00:29:12.600
 - I think that might be true, but I'm not sure.

00:29:12.600 --> 00:29:14.600
 - I think that's to cure a different thing.

00:29:14.600 --> 00:29:17.600
 I think there's a thing called peoria where the penis starts to bend,

00:29:17.600 --> 00:29:20.600
 and it happens increasingly as you get older and it's incredibly painful,

00:29:20.600 --> 00:29:22.600
 and there are now ways of dealing with it, but...

00:29:22.600 --> 00:29:27.600
 - Also, if your penis isn't flat enough, that'll be fine.

00:29:27.600 --> 00:29:30.600
 - Can we get back to this? Poor kid.

00:29:30.600 --> 00:29:33.600
 - Sorry, what was this? A young girl, seven years old.

00:29:33.600 --> 00:29:35.600
 - Martha Gibson, she was clapping.

00:29:35.600 --> 00:29:37.600
 - Her family noticed, she's got an incredibly loud clap.

00:29:37.600 --> 00:29:42.600
 You know, some people, they really have these hollow space in their hands,

00:29:42.600 --> 00:29:47.600
 and it's apparently the equivalent of a heavy goods vehicle passing by, 73 decibels,

00:29:47.600 --> 00:29:49.600
 and they got someone from Guinness to measure it.

00:29:49.600 --> 00:29:50.600
 - So a seven-year-old?

00:29:50.600 --> 00:29:54.600
 - Yeah, and maybe there's someone louder who hasn't been officially Guinness-approved measured.

00:29:54.600 --> 00:29:57.600
 Anyway, she was born in 1998, which means she's out there somewhere.

00:29:57.600 --> 00:29:58.600
 - Yeah.

00:29:58.600 --> 00:29:59.600
 - You know, she's in her 20s now.

00:29:59.600 --> 00:30:00.600
 I don't know if she's still...

00:30:00.600 --> 00:30:02.600
 - She has a bit 20 of heartaches, I can say that.

00:30:02.600 --> 00:30:04.600
 [laughter]

00:30:04.600 --> 00:30:07.600
 - Can I say one last thing from these? It's a funny old world.

00:30:07.600 --> 00:30:08.600
 - Yeah, yeah.

00:30:08.600 --> 00:30:10.600
 - So, they're just such great stories.

00:30:10.600 --> 00:30:15.600
 A sexline caller complained to trading standards after dialing an 0891 number

00:30:15.600 --> 00:30:19.600
 for an advertisement saying, "Hear me moan only to be played a tape of a woman

00:30:19.600 --> 00:30:21.600
 nagging her husband for failing to do jobs around the house."

00:30:21.600 --> 00:30:24.600
 [laughter]

00:30:24.600 --> 00:30:27.600
 And then a sign seen in a police canteen in Christchurch, New Zealand,

00:30:27.600 --> 00:30:31.600
 "Will the person who took a slice of cake from the commissioner's office return it immediately.

00:30:31.600 --> 00:30:33.600
 It is needed as evidence in a poisoning case."

00:30:33.600 --> 00:30:35.600
 [laughter]

00:30:35.600 --> 00:30:41.600
 [music]

00:30:41.600 --> 00:30:45.600
 Okay, it's time for fact number three, and that is Andy.

00:30:45.600 --> 00:30:48.600
 My fact is that despite them being one of the largest fish on the planet,

00:30:48.600 --> 00:30:52.600
 nobody knows where female whale sharks live.

00:30:52.600 --> 00:30:53.600
 - So, not the ocean.

00:30:53.600 --> 00:30:54.600
 - Yes, the ocean.

00:30:54.600 --> 00:30:55.600
 - Oh.

00:30:55.600 --> 00:30:56.600
 - Yeah, so...

00:30:56.600 --> 00:30:57.600
 [laughter]

00:30:57.600 --> 00:30:58.600
 - Okay, next fact.

00:30:58.600 --> 00:30:59.600
 [laughter]

00:30:59.600 --> 00:31:01.600
 - Solve that quickly.

00:31:01.600 --> 00:31:02.600
 - Oh, wow.

00:31:02.600 --> 00:31:03.600
 - Tell us the creek.

00:31:03.600 --> 00:31:04.600
 - Detective Dan investigates.

00:31:04.600 --> 00:31:06.600
 - You are welcome.

00:31:06.600 --> 00:31:07.600
 - They live in the ocean.

00:31:07.600 --> 00:31:08.600
 - It's a big place.

00:31:08.600 --> 00:31:09.600
 - It's a big place.

00:31:09.600 --> 00:31:12.600
 Just a shout out to Rich Horner, who sent this fact in,

00:31:12.600 --> 00:31:14.600
 not knowing that, you know, Dan...

00:31:14.600 --> 00:31:15.600
 - Would solve it so quickly.

00:31:15.600 --> 00:31:16.600
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:31:16.600 --> 00:31:19.600
 This is about whale sharks, which are absolutely massive,

00:31:19.600 --> 00:31:21.600
 and I don't know very much about them.

00:31:21.600 --> 00:31:22.600
 They're the largest shark.

00:31:22.600 --> 00:31:23.600
 - Yeah.

00:31:23.600 --> 00:31:24.600
 - So they're not a whale, they're a shark.

00:31:24.600 --> 00:31:25.600
 - Yeah.

00:31:25.600 --> 00:31:26.600
 - And they're only called a whale shark,

00:31:26.600 --> 00:31:27.600
 because they're just so huge.

00:31:27.600 --> 00:31:29.600
 - Largest fish, I reckon.

00:31:29.600 --> 00:31:30.600
 He said one of the largest fish,

00:31:30.600 --> 00:31:31.600
 but there can't be many bigger.

00:31:31.600 --> 00:31:33.600
 - They're a sunfish, aren't they, which are massive.

00:31:33.600 --> 00:31:34.600
 - Oh, they are.

00:31:34.600 --> 00:31:35.600
 - I don't know.

00:31:35.600 --> 00:31:36.600
 There are different dimensions, aren't they?

00:31:36.600 --> 00:31:37.600
 There's mass, and then there's length,

00:31:37.600 --> 00:31:38.600
 and there's all of this.

00:31:38.600 --> 00:31:39.600
 But they are absolutely huge.

00:31:39.600 --> 00:31:46.600
 - I haven't, like, a year too much at three elephants.

00:31:46.600 --> 00:31:47.600
 - Wow.

00:31:47.600 --> 00:31:48.600
 - Yeah.

00:31:48.600 --> 00:31:49.600
 - And yet we don't know where the females live.

00:31:49.600 --> 00:31:50.600
 It's mad.

00:31:50.600 --> 00:31:52.600
 So scientists, they know where young males are,

00:31:52.600 --> 00:31:54.600
 because they tend to frequent waters

00:31:54.600 --> 00:31:56.600
 that are more coastal, and...

00:31:56.600 --> 00:31:58.600
 Oh, they're very harmless, by the way, should say.

00:31:58.600 --> 00:32:01.600
 They're omnivores, but they eat plankton, and...

00:32:01.600 --> 00:32:02.600
 - Not if you're a plankton.

00:32:02.600 --> 00:32:04.600
 - Well, that's a good point, yeah.

00:32:04.600 --> 00:32:06.600
 And there's one place where scientists know

00:32:06.600 --> 00:32:08.600
 they're likely to find female whale sharks,

00:32:08.600 --> 00:32:10.600
 which is just off Darwin,

00:32:10.600 --> 00:32:12.600
 which is the northernmost Galapagos island.

00:32:12.600 --> 00:32:15.600
 But that's the only place that they know they hang out.

00:32:15.600 --> 00:32:16.600
 - Okay.

00:32:16.600 --> 00:32:17.600
 - I mean, they live, you know,

00:32:17.600 --> 00:32:18.600
 across thousands of miles of ocean.

00:32:18.600 --> 00:32:19.600
 They're just missing.

00:32:19.600 --> 00:32:20.600
 - Just evade us.

00:32:20.600 --> 00:32:21.600
 - Yeah.

00:32:21.600 --> 00:32:25.600
 - I read that they actually found

00:32:25.600 --> 00:32:31.600
 water-confirmed pregnant whale sharks,

00:32:31.600 --> 00:32:36.600
 and it was 10.6 metres.

00:32:36.600 --> 00:32:37.600
 - Okay.

00:32:37.600 --> 00:32:42.600
 - And she contained 300...

00:32:42.600 --> 00:32:43.600
 - What?

00:32:43.600 --> 00:32:44.600
 - What?

00:32:44.600 --> 00:32:45.600
 - ...300?

00:32:45.600 --> 00:32:46.600
 - Yeah.

00:32:46.600 --> 00:32:47.600
 - Holy moly.

00:32:47.600 --> 00:32:50.600
 - But they don't all shark bite.

00:32:50.600 --> 00:32:51.600
 - Well, thank...

00:32:51.600 --> 00:32:52.600
 I mean, thank goodness.

00:32:52.600 --> 00:32:53.600
 In a sense.

00:32:53.600 --> 00:32:54.600
 We know exactly where they all work,

00:32:54.600 --> 00:32:55.600
 because it would be knee-deep.

00:32:55.600 --> 00:32:57.600
 It would be like Bridlington and...

00:32:57.600 --> 00:32:58.600
 - Oh, god.

00:32:58.600 --> 00:32:59.600
 - Fish and shape shops.

00:32:59.600 --> 00:33:00.600
 - Yeah.

00:33:00.600 --> 00:33:01.600
 - Wow.

00:33:01.600 --> 00:33:04.600
 - Yeah, and they give birth...

00:33:04.600 --> 00:33:06.600
 They're called Aplacentally Viviparis.

00:33:06.600 --> 00:33:09.600
 So, other parruses where you lay an egg,

00:33:09.600 --> 00:33:11.600
 Viviparis is live young,

00:33:11.600 --> 00:33:16.600
 but Aplacental Viviparis is where you lay an egg inside yourself.

00:33:16.600 --> 00:33:18.600
 It then hatches also inside you,

00:33:18.600 --> 00:33:20.600
 and then you eventually give birth to the live young,

00:33:20.600 --> 00:33:21.600
 which is actually...

00:33:21.600 --> 00:33:24.600
 So, 300 eggs will have hatched inside that mother.

00:33:24.600 --> 00:33:26.600
 - Those eggs are the biggest eggs on Earth as well.

00:33:26.600 --> 00:33:27.600
 - Are they?

00:33:27.600 --> 00:33:28.600
 - Yeah.

00:33:28.600 --> 00:33:30.600
 - I didn't realise that...

00:33:30.600 --> 00:33:32.600
 This might be common knowledge,

00:33:32.600 --> 00:33:33.600
 but what makes...

00:33:33.600 --> 00:33:35.600
 This is a whale shark.

00:33:35.600 --> 00:33:36.600
 What makes it more shark than whale?

00:33:36.600 --> 00:33:38.600
 What's the difference between a whale and a shark?

00:33:38.600 --> 00:33:40.600
 - One's a mammal and one's a fish.

00:33:40.600 --> 00:33:41.600
 - Yeah, but one other difference,

00:33:41.600 --> 00:33:42.600
 which I didn't know,

00:33:42.600 --> 00:33:44.600
 is that sharks are all cartilage,

00:33:44.600 --> 00:33:45.600
 and whales are bone.

00:33:45.600 --> 00:33:46.600
 - Oh, right, yeah.

00:33:46.600 --> 00:33:47.600
 - That's what makes it the shark.

00:33:47.600 --> 00:33:48.600
 - That's true.

00:33:48.600 --> 00:33:49.600
 - Is that crazy?

00:33:49.600 --> 00:33:50.600
 No bones?

00:33:50.600 --> 00:33:53.600
 - One interesting thing because of that is that,

00:33:53.600 --> 00:33:56.600
 you know how or I know this because I'm old?

00:33:56.600 --> 00:33:57.600
 As you get older as a human,

00:33:57.600 --> 00:33:58.600
 you kind of get stiffer.

00:33:58.600 --> 00:33:59.600
 - Yeah.

00:33:59.600 --> 00:34:00.600
 - A lot.

00:34:00.600 --> 00:34:02.600
 Well, sharks are the opposite.

00:34:02.600 --> 00:34:04.600
 Sharks start off being quite stiff,

00:34:04.600 --> 00:34:05.600
 and then as they get older,

00:34:05.600 --> 00:34:07.600
 they get fluffier and fluffier.

00:34:07.600 --> 00:34:08.600
 - Yeah, that's funny.

00:34:08.600 --> 00:34:09.600
 - Maybe.

00:34:09.600 --> 00:34:14.600
 Maybe I haven't got cerebral palsy.

00:34:14.600 --> 00:34:17.600
 Maybe I'm a shark.

00:34:17.600 --> 00:34:20.600
 - If you've got more than 300 teeth,

00:34:20.600 --> 00:34:21.600
 that is another sign.

00:34:21.600 --> 00:34:22.600
 - Oh, no.

00:34:22.600 --> 00:34:25.600
 I've only got 200.

00:34:29.600 --> 00:34:37.600
 - Speaking of teeth, whales have teeth on their eyes.

00:34:37.600 --> 00:34:38.600
 - Oh, yeah?

00:34:38.600 --> 00:34:39.600
 - Yeah.

00:34:39.600 --> 00:34:40.600
 - What are they called?

00:34:40.600 --> 00:34:41.600
 Denticles or something like this?

00:34:41.600 --> 00:34:42.600
 - Yeah.

00:34:42.600 --> 00:34:45.600
 - Because sharks don't have eyelids.

00:34:45.600 --> 00:34:50.600
 So in order to protect them,

00:34:50.600 --> 00:34:54.600
 they have what looks like little teeth.

00:34:54.600 --> 00:34:55.600
 - Yeah.

00:34:55.600 --> 00:34:56.600
 - That's amazing.

00:34:56.600 --> 00:34:58.600
 - And their eyes stick out a tiny bit from their head,

00:34:58.600 --> 00:35:00.600
 which is also a problem, obviously,

00:35:00.600 --> 00:35:01.600
 in terms of protecting them.

00:35:01.600 --> 00:35:02.600
 - Yeah.

00:35:02.600 --> 00:35:03.600
 - So they have another trick,

00:35:03.600 --> 00:35:04.600
 which is that they can retract their eyes.

00:35:04.600 --> 00:35:05.600
 - Oh, really?

00:35:05.600 --> 00:35:06.600
 - They just go, boop.

00:35:06.600 --> 00:35:08.600
 - When what?

00:35:08.600 --> 00:35:09.600
 - I guess when danger threatens.

00:35:09.600 --> 00:35:10.600
 It's quite a long way.

00:35:10.600 --> 00:35:12.600
 It's about half the diameter of the eyeball.

00:35:12.600 --> 00:35:13.600
 They can just--

00:35:13.600 --> 00:35:14.600
 - Wow.

00:35:14.600 --> 00:35:17.600
 I love the ugly noises for whenever animals do anything at all.

00:35:17.600 --> 00:35:20.600
 - I remember when hippos retracted their testicles

00:35:20.600 --> 00:35:21.600
 by going, boop.

00:35:21.600 --> 00:35:22.600
 - Exactly.

00:35:22.600 --> 00:35:23.600
 The teeth as well.

00:35:23.600 --> 00:35:25.600
 So these teeth that are all over their eyes

00:35:25.600 --> 00:35:26.600
 are all over their body as well.

00:35:26.600 --> 00:35:28.600
 They've got these denticles all over their body.

00:35:28.600 --> 00:35:30.600
 And I've read this description saying that

00:35:30.600 --> 00:35:31.600
 it's a protection thing.

00:35:31.600 --> 00:35:33.600
 So if another shark bites them back,

00:35:33.600 --> 00:35:35.600
 without them really doing anything,

00:35:35.600 --> 00:35:37.600
 they're sort of biting the shark back itself,

00:35:37.600 --> 00:35:40.600
 because the teeth might hurt a bit, I guess,

00:35:40.600 --> 00:35:41.600
 if you're biting into it.

00:35:41.600 --> 00:35:42.600
 - Oh, right.

00:35:42.600 --> 00:35:43.600
 - That's just mad.

00:35:43.600 --> 00:35:44.600
 - Yeah, crazy.

00:35:44.600 --> 00:35:47.600
 - They're biting something from your torso.

00:35:47.600 --> 00:35:49.600
 - It's nuts.

00:35:49.600 --> 00:35:51.600
 They grow really quickly.

00:35:51.600 --> 00:35:52.600
 So they're born quite big,

00:35:52.600 --> 00:35:54.600
 but then they get really big.

00:35:54.600 --> 00:35:56.600
 So there was one in an aquarium

00:35:56.600 --> 00:35:59.600
 that went from weighing 1.7 pounds

00:35:59.600 --> 00:36:04.600
 to 333.4 pounds in three years,

00:36:04.600 --> 00:36:05.600
 just over three years.

00:36:05.600 --> 00:36:07.600
 And I worked out in human terms,

00:36:07.600 --> 00:36:10.600
 that would be equivalent of a three-year-old baby

00:36:10.600 --> 00:36:13.600
 growing to the size of the world's largest unicycle.

00:36:13.600 --> 00:36:17.600
 - You always go too far with these things.

00:36:17.600 --> 00:36:18.600
 You always think,

00:36:18.600 --> 00:36:20.600
 "I can cram in one more fact here."

00:36:20.600 --> 00:36:22.600
 - You can imagine that with the world figures.

00:36:22.600 --> 00:36:23.600
 - Well, I can imagine a range of things

00:36:23.600 --> 00:36:24.600
 with the world's biggest unicycle,

00:36:24.600 --> 00:36:26.600
 because right now I'm imagining the Empire State Building

00:36:26.600 --> 00:36:28.600
 with a unicycle leaning up against the entire night of it.

00:36:28.600 --> 00:36:29.600
 - Oh, no, it's smaller than that.

00:36:29.600 --> 00:36:30.600
 - How big is the world's biggest unicycle?

00:36:30.600 --> 00:36:31.600
 - It's 31 feet.

00:36:31.600 --> 00:36:32.600
 - Oh, that's big.

00:36:32.600 --> 00:36:34.600
 - I thought everyone knew that, actually.

00:36:34.600 --> 00:36:35.600
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:36:35.600 --> 00:36:36.600
 - 31 feet.

00:36:36.600 --> 00:36:37.600
 - As in 31 feet,

00:36:37.600 --> 00:36:41.600
 but in the same proportions as a normal human.

00:36:41.600 --> 00:36:45.600
 - So the child wouldn't look like a unicycle,

00:36:45.600 --> 00:36:46.600
 is what you're saying?

00:36:46.600 --> 00:36:49.600
 - No, it would look like a normal proportioned human,

00:36:49.600 --> 00:36:50.600
 but 31 feet tall.

00:36:50.600 --> 00:36:51.600
 - Yeah.

00:36:51.600 --> 00:36:52.600
 - Oh, my God.

00:36:52.600 --> 00:36:54.600
 - I think the unicycle thing is really thrown.

00:36:54.600 --> 00:36:57.600
 (all laughing)

00:36:57.600 --> 00:36:58.600
 - I've got more questions about the unicycle now.

00:36:58.600 --> 00:36:59.600
 Is it rideable, this unicycle?

00:36:59.600 --> 00:37:00.600
 - Yeah, it has to be rideable,

00:37:00.600 --> 00:37:02.600
 otherwise it doesn't get the world record.

00:37:02.600 --> 00:37:03.600
 - Yeah.

00:37:03.600 --> 00:37:05.600
 - God, that must be a terrifying unicycle ride.

00:37:05.600 --> 00:37:06.600
 - Yeah.

00:37:06.600 --> 00:37:07.600
 - How long must your legs be to ride that?

00:37:07.600 --> 00:37:08.600
 - Yeah.

00:37:08.600 --> 00:37:10.600
 - I think what they do is they keep the pedals

00:37:10.600 --> 00:37:12.600
 quite close to where your bum is,

00:37:12.600 --> 00:37:14.600
 like the same distance as your leg.

00:37:14.600 --> 00:37:16.600
 - I wouldn't have done it that way,

00:37:16.600 --> 00:37:18.600
 but I think they've done it better, actually.

00:37:18.600 --> 00:37:21.600
 (all laughing)

00:37:21.600 --> 00:37:23.600
 - That was a big wheel.

00:37:23.600 --> 00:37:27.600
 - No, it's mostly like a long stalk.

00:37:27.600 --> 00:37:28.600
 - It's mostly the pole, yeah.

00:37:28.600 --> 00:37:30.600
 - It's really, it's a normal unicycle,

00:37:30.600 --> 00:37:32.600
 but they've just extended the distance

00:37:32.600 --> 00:37:34.600
 between the wheel and the pedals.

00:37:34.600 --> 00:37:36.600
 - I've seen people do it on these record size.

00:37:36.600 --> 00:37:37.600
 It's petrified.

00:37:37.600 --> 00:37:39.600
 - Well, you would be able to know exactly

00:37:39.600 --> 00:37:41.600
 how big one of these babies that don't exist would be,

00:37:41.600 --> 00:37:43.600
 because you've seen it yourself.

00:37:43.600 --> 00:37:44.600
 - Yes, exactly.

00:37:44.600 --> 00:37:45.600
 So I was on board.

00:37:45.600 --> 00:37:48.600
 - I thought it was a fantastic analogy.

00:37:48.600 --> 00:37:50.600
 You need to watch more YouTube clips, you too.

00:37:50.600 --> 00:37:53.600
 (all laughing)

00:37:53.600 --> 00:37:55.600
 - These pups, we were talking about a bit earlier.

00:37:55.600 --> 00:37:56.600
 - Yeah.

00:37:56.600 --> 00:37:59.600
 - So those 300 pups, this is a really cool thing.

00:37:59.600 --> 00:38:01.600
 They're often, inside the mother,

00:38:01.600 --> 00:38:03.600
 there are different stages of development,

00:38:03.600 --> 00:38:06.600
 but they're all from the same father, Whale Shark.

00:38:06.600 --> 00:38:09.600
 The mother can basically stall sperm for ages

00:38:09.600 --> 00:38:13.600
 and gradually fertilize a little bit at a time.

00:38:13.600 --> 00:38:14.600
 - Oh, yeah.

00:38:14.600 --> 00:38:15.600
 - Yeah, you know.

00:38:15.600 --> 00:38:17.600
 - Yeah, so I think other sharks do it,

00:38:17.600 --> 00:38:18.600
 and maybe even kangaroos,

00:38:18.600 --> 00:38:21.600
 where they sort of like pocket away the sperm.

00:38:21.600 --> 00:38:23.600
 - That's not what's in that pocket, is it?

00:38:23.600 --> 00:38:25.600
 (all laughing)

00:38:25.600 --> 00:38:26.600
 It's full of sperm.

00:38:26.600 --> 00:38:28.600
 (all laughing)

00:38:28.600 --> 00:38:29.600
 - Wow, really, is that right?

00:38:29.600 --> 00:38:31.600
 - So it's one, just to get this right,

00:38:31.600 --> 00:38:35.600
 it's one male Whale Shark, has sex,

00:38:35.600 --> 00:38:37.600
 the female keeps all the sperm,

00:38:37.600 --> 00:38:40.600
 and then slowly has more and more children.

00:38:40.600 --> 00:38:41.600
 - Exactly, exactly.

00:38:41.600 --> 00:38:43.600
 I think it's one mating session.

00:38:43.600 --> 00:38:44.600
 - And then...

00:38:44.600 --> 00:38:49.600
 - Imagine if humans could do that.

00:38:49.600 --> 00:38:54.600
 Show me you had sex for 20 years already.

00:38:54.600 --> 00:38:55.600
 - Yeah.

00:38:55.600 --> 00:38:59.600
 - Coming round with a baby.

00:38:59.600 --> 00:39:01.600
 - Yeah, when you finally get the call

00:39:01.600 --> 00:39:02.600
 that you've got an illegitimate child,

00:39:02.600 --> 00:39:05.600
 it's like, you've got 20 illegitimate kids.

00:39:05.600 --> 00:39:06.600
 - Yeah.

00:39:06.600 --> 00:39:08.600
 - And they're the size of the world's largest uter cycle.

00:39:08.600 --> 00:39:09.600
 - Yeah.

00:39:09.600 --> 00:39:10.600
 - And that drunken night in Biddlington,

00:39:10.600 --> 00:39:11.600
 well, you're a...

00:39:11.600 --> 00:39:18.600
 - 118, 112, 108.

00:39:18.600 --> 00:39:19.600
 - Yeah.

00:39:19.600 --> 00:39:21.600
 - They have this really interesting habit,

00:39:21.600 --> 00:39:22.600
 Whale Sharks, which is,

00:39:22.600 --> 00:39:24.600
 they dive down about 2,000 meters.

00:39:24.600 --> 00:39:25.600
 - Yeah.

00:39:25.600 --> 00:39:27.600
 - Huge, it's the largest vertical range,

00:39:27.600 --> 00:39:29.600
 almost, of any sea creature.

00:39:29.600 --> 00:39:33.600
 - Oh, that's like 200 times the size of the world's largest uter cycle.

00:39:33.600 --> 00:39:34.600
 - Oh my gosh.

00:39:34.600 --> 00:39:35.600
 (all laughing)

00:39:35.600 --> 00:39:38.600
 - Yeah, well, that really makes you think, doesn't it?

00:39:38.600 --> 00:39:39.600
 Imagine that.

00:39:39.600 --> 00:39:42.600
 - How long would your legs have to be taking that?

00:39:42.600 --> 00:39:43.600
 - Okay, so...

00:39:43.600 --> 00:39:45.600
 - And the thing is, we don't know why.

00:39:45.600 --> 00:39:47.600
 And also, when they sink,

00:39:47.600 --> 00:39:50.600
 so scientists often tag the few that they can find to research,

00:39:50.600 --> 00:39:52.600
 because that's a really useful thing for them,

00:39:52.600 --> 00:39:55.600
 but it shakes, basically, the tags don't work 2,000 meters down.

00:39:55.600 --> 00:39:56.600
 - Oh, really?

00:39:56.600 --> 00:39:58.600
 - So they can see in the dark as a result.

00:39:58.600 --> 00:39:59.600
 They've got special genetic mutation,

00:39:59.600 --> 00:40:00.600
 which allows them to see in the dark,

00:40:00.600 --> 00:40:01.600
 because they are so deep down.

00:40:01.600 --> 00:40:02.600
 - Wow.

00:40:02.600 --> 00:40:03.600
 - But there is a...

00:40:03.600 --> 00:40:04.600
 And we don't know why they do it,

00:40:04.600 --> 00:40:06.600
 because down there, there's less oxygen,

00:40:06.600 --> 00:40:08.600
 there's less food, it's very cold,

00:40:08.600 --> 00:40:11.600
 so they have to warm themselves up a bit afterwards.

00:40:11.600 --> 00:40:13.600
 There is one theory.

00:40:13.600 --> 00:40:14.600
 Well, there are a couple of theories, I think,

00:40:14.600 --> 00:40:18.600
 but this is from a whale shark scientist called Simon Pierce,

00:40:18.600 --> 00:40:21.600
 which is that it might be so they can navigate better,

00:40:21.600 --> 00:40:24.600
 because they can get a better reading of the Earth's magnetic field

00:40:24.600 --> 00:40:26.600
 closer to the crust.

00:40:26.600 --> 00:40:27.600
 - Oh, wow.

00:40:27.600 --> 00:40:30.600
 - Which is effectively that they're going to get a better signal.

00:40:30.600 --> 00:40:33.600
 - That's amazing, which I love as a theory.

00:40:33.600 --> 00:40:36.600
 - It's like holding your phone up in the Earth to get a better signal.

00:40:36.600 --> 00:40:37.600
 - Yeah, it's exactly like that.

00:40:37.600 --> 00:40:39.600
 - Wow, that's super.

00:40:39.600 --> 00:40:40.600
 - Yeah.

00:40:40.600 --> 00:40:41.600
 - It's incredible.

00:40:41.600 --> 00:40:45.600
 We don't know if they make noises as in vocalizations.

00:40:45.600 --> 00:40:46.600
 - Oh, really?

00:40:46.600 --> 00:40:48.600
 - Well, we kind of know that they don't,

00:40:48.600 --> 00:40:51.600
 but there's a few scientists that think that they do.

00:40:51.600 --> 00:40:52.600
 - Okay.

00:40:52.600 --> 00:40:53.600
 - And it's very confusing,

00:40:53.600 --> 00:40:55.600
 because they don't, as far as we can tell,

00:40:55.600 --> 00:40:57.600
 have anything that would make a sound.

00:40:57.600 --> 00:40:59.600
 No vocal cords whatsoever.

00:40:59.600 --> 00:41:00.600
 The way that their teeth are set up

00:41:00.600 --> 00:41:02.600
 is they can't do a grinding sound

00:41:02.600 --> 00:41:04.600
 to create a noise that comes out as grinding.

00:41:04.600 --> 00:41:06.600
 So they don't have a swim bladder,

00:41:06.600 --> 00:41:10.600
 which a lot of fish will use to control buoyancy,

00:41:10.600 --> 00:41:12.600
 but also noise will come out of that that you'll hear.

00:41:12.600 --> 00:41:16.600
 So you don't have anywhere really that sound can come from.

00:41:16.600 --> 00:41:18.600
 Yet there is a scientist called Heather Barrett

00:41:18.600 --> 00:41:20.600
 who has been recording them,

00:41:20.600 --> 00:41:22.600
 and a couple of times has got sound out of them.

00:41:22.600 --> 00:41:24.600
 So it's a sort of mysterious thing.

00:41:24.600 --> 00:41:26.600
 She's been following this one male called Shredder.

00:41:26.600 --> 00:41:28.600
 She said she thought it sounded like two strokes

00:41:28.600 --> 00:41:31.600
 over the ridged back of those wooden frog noisemakers,

00:41:31.600 --> 00:41:33.600
 salted tourists in every Mexican market.

00:41:33.600 --> 00:41:37.600
 Another relatable example.

00:41:37.600 --> 00:41:38.600
 - Oh my God.

00:41:38.600 --> 00:41:41.600
 - But yeah, so big mystery to be solved.

00:41:41.600 --> 00:41:42.600
 - Wow.

00:41:42.600 --> 00:41:43.600
 - Do the whale sharks make noises.

00:41:43.600 --> 00:41:44.600
 - Very cool.

00:41:44.600 --> 00:41:45.600
 - Yeah.

00:41:45.600 --> 00:41:47.600
 - I was looking at some odd females in the animal kingdom.

00:41:47.600 --> 00:41:48.600
 - Oh yeah.

00:41:48.600 --> 00:41:51.600
 - Because I found that there's a thing called a pouched rat,

00:41:51.600 --> 00:41:55.600
 and some female pouched rats can create a chemical

00:41:55.600 --> 00:41:58.600
 that makes all the other females vaginas seal up.

00:41:58.600 --> 00:42:01.600
 (all laughing)

00:42:01.600 --> 00:42:02.600
 - Wow.

00:42:02.600 --> 00:42:04.600
 - Isn't that amazing?

00:42:04.600 --> 00:42:05.600
 - Wow.

00:42:05.600 --> 00:42:08.600
 So is it a status?

00:42:08.600 --> 00:42:09.600
 - Yeah.

00:42:09.600 --> 00:42:11.600
 - Do you have to be the sort of lead?

00:42:11.600 --> 00:42:12.600
 - You're a spot on.

00:42:12.600 --> 00:42:15.600
 So like the most dominant female in a pack of pouched rats,

00:42:15.600 --> 00:42:17.600
 she'll be the one who's mating,

00:42:17.600 --> 00:42:19.600
 and to stop any of the other females mating,

00:42:19.600 --> 00:42:21.600
 she sends out this chemical,

00:42:21.600 --> 00:42:23.600
 and all the vaginas go, "Rick!"

00:42:23.600 --> 00:42:24.600
 (all laughing)

00:42:24.600 --> 00:42:25.600
 - And close up.

00:42:25.600 --> 00:42:27.600
 - You put it in terms I can understand now.

00:42:27.600 --> 00:42:28.600
 (all laughing)

00:42:28.600 --> 00:42:30.600
 - Isn't that amazing?

00:42:30.600 --> 00:42:31.600
 I find that astonishing.

00:42:31.600 --> 00:42:33.600
 - What a power move.

00:42:33.600 --> 00:42:36.600
 (all laughing)

00:42:36.600 --> 00:42:37.600
 - That's the craziest thing.

00:42:37.600 --> 00:42:39.600
 That's one of all the years.

00:42:39.600 --> 00:42:42.600
 That's one of the weirdest facts I think I've ever had on this show.

00:42:42.600 --> 00:42:44.600
 - You should write Funny Old World for the Guardian.

00:42:44.600 --> 00:42:46.600
 (all laughing)

00:42:46.600 --> 00:42:51.600
 (upbeat music)

00:42:51.600 --> 00:42:54.600
 - Okay, it is time for our final fact of the show,

00:42:54.600 --> 00:42:55.600
 and that is James.

00:42:55.600 --> 00:43:00.600
 - Okay, my fact this week is that the place where Judas plotted to betray Jesus

00:43:00.600 --> 00:43:03.600
 is about to become a ziplining site.

00:43:03.600 --> 00:43:04.600
 (all laughing)

00:43:04.600 --> 00:43:05.600
 - So cool.

00:43:05.600 --> 00:43:08.600
 Will they mark on the ground the point where Judas did the exact plotting

00:43:08.600 --> 00:43:11.600
 so that as you zipline over it, you can contemplate that?

00:43:11.600 --> 00:43:12.600
 - That would be good.

00:43:12.600 --> 00:43:16.600
 Or maybe you have to pay 30 pieces of silver or anything else to do it.

00:43:16.600 --> 00:43:17.600
 I don't know.

00:43:17.600 --> 00:43:19.600
 This is in Jerusalem,

00:43:19.600 --> 00:43:24.600
 and it's an area sometimes known as the Hill of Evil Council.

00:43:24.600 --> 00:43:28.600
 And according to tradition, this is where Judas plotted to betray Jesus.

00:43:28.600 --> 00:43:34.600
 And it's part of a more general sort of attempt in Jerusalem

00:43:34.600 --> 00:43:38.600
 to bring more tourists in and make it more tourist friendly.

00:43:38.600 --> 00:43:43.600
 Although some people say it as part of a bigger political strategy

00:43:43.600 --> 00:43:47.600
 to make East and West Jerusalem less solid things

00:43:47.600 --> 00:43:51.600
 and maybe make Jerusalem a more Israeli area.

00:43:51.600 --> 00:43:54.600
 - What does ziplines do? They cross borders.

00:43:54.600 --> 00:43:57.600
 Normally a good thing, but sometimes it can be controversial.

00:43:57.600 --> 00:43:58.600
 - It can be controversial.

00:43:58.600 --> 00:44:00.600
 And according to some people, in this case it is.

00:44:00.600 --> 00:44:01.600
 - Can I check?

00:44:01.600 --> 00:44:02.600
 Sorry, James.

00:44:02.600 --> 00:44:04.600
 What you said, the place where Judas plotted to betray Jesus,

00:44:04.600 --> 00:44:08.600
 I thought, well, maybe this is the place where Judas actually betrayed Jesus.

00:44:08.600 --> 00:44:09.600
 - The Garden of Gethsemane.

00:44:09.600 --> 00:44:10.600
 - Garden of Gethsemane.

00:44:10.600 --> 00:44:11.600
 - Yeah, that's where he did the actual betrayal.

00:44:11.600 --> 00:44:13.600
 - So this is just like the pre-betrayal--

00:44:13.600 --> 00:44:15.600
 - This is where he thought about it.

00:44:15.600 --> 00:44:19.600
 He was like, you know, you can't just turn up at the Garden of Gethsemane with no plan.

00:44:19.600 --> 00:44:21.600
 You need to think about it first.

00:44:21.600 --> 00:44:25.600
 - If you fail to prepare to betray Jesus, you prepare to fail.

00:44:25.600 --> 00:44:27.600
 - Yeah, and this was in the Hill of Evil Council.

00:44:27.600 --> 00:44:31.600
 So it was where, I think it was where the Romans sort of came up to him

00:44:31.600 --> 00:44:34.600
 and said, hey, want to do a bit of betraying?

00:44:34.600 --> 00:44:35.600
 - Wow.

00:44:35.600 --> 00:44:38.600
 - And yeah, that was where that supposedly happened.

00:44:38.600 --> 00:44:41.600
 - At the end of that meeting, Judas went, God, I wonder one day in the future,

00:44:41.600 --> 00:44:43.600
 how they're going to commemorate this spot.

00:44:43.600 --> 00:44:46.600
 A statue of me, what's it going to be?

00:44:46.600 --> 00:44:49.600
 - And then, yeah, you can get on your zipline

00:44:49.600 --> 00:44:52.600
 and it'll take you down to a place called the Peace Forest.

00:44:52.600 --> 00:44:54.600
 - Oh, lovely.

00:44:54.600 --> 00:44:58.600
 - It doesn't have any biblical story attached to it.

00:44:58.600 --> 00:45:01.600
 But then the developers are saying, well, it's nothing to do with this political thing.

00:45:01.600 --> 00:45:04.600
 It's actually because they're quite neglected areas.

00:45:04.600 --> 00:45:07.600
 A lot of drug dealers around there.

00:45:07.600 --> 00:45:11.600
 - So how do you fight drug dealing with ziplines?

00:45:11.600 --> 00:45:12.600
 Yeah, yeah.

00:45:12.600 --> 00:45:14.600
 Make it easier to escape, yeah.

00:45:14.600 --> 00:45:18.600
 - Yeah, you can do the job.

00:45:18.600 --> 00:45:21.600
 - Put a ziplock on a zipline.

00:45:21.600 --> 00:45:25.600
 - It's very hard to drop a single E into someone's mouth from a zipline, though.

00:45:25.600 --> 00:45:26.600
 That is a...

00:45:26.600 --> 00:45:30.600
 - I smell a challenge.

00:45:30.600 --> 00:45:32.600
 - I've never been on a zipline.

00:45:32.600 --> 00:45:33.600
 - I have.

00:45:33.600 --> 00:45:34.600
 - Have you?

00:45:34.600 --> 00:45:40.600
 - Oh, yes, I went to the channel for travel show.

00:45:40.600 --> 00:45:50.600
 But in hindsight, I think the producers were trying to kill me.

00:45:50.600 --> 00:45:58.600
 Because every day I go in the office and be like,

00:45:58.600 --> 00:46:00.600
 "Okay, turn that off.

00:46:00.600 --> 00:46:04.600
 You're going to skydive."

00:46:04.600 --> 00:46:08.600
 - Whoa, were the producers related to anyone you'd slagged off at the Paralympics?

00:46:08.600 --> 00:46:09.600
 The previous, yeah.

00:46:09.600 --> 00:46:10.600
 Was that okay?

00:46:10.600 --> 00:46:12.600
 - They all had an E, didn't they?

00:46:12.600 --> 00:46:13.600
 And they were...

00:46:13.600 --> 00:46:20.600
 - Look, so we did one episode in Wales,

00:46:20.600 --> 00:46:28.600
 which is home to the longest and fastest zipline,

00:46:28.600 --> 00:46:33.600
 and it was incredible.

00:46:33.600 --> 00:46:35.600
 - That one looks amazing.

00:46:35.600 --> 00:46:36.600
 I've seen clips of that.

00:46:36.600 --> 00:46:37.600
 It doesn't look very cool.

00:46:37.600 --> 00:46:38.600
 - Jenny Eclair, was it?

00:46:38.600 --> 00:46:39.600
 - Yeah.

00:46:39.600 --> 00:46:40.600
 - Yeah.

00:46:40.600 --> 00:46:41.600
 - How do you know?

00:46:41.600 --> 00:46:42.600
 - It was on television.

00:46:42.600 --> 00:46:50.600
 - I thought I just did it for fun.

00:46:50.600 --> 00:46:58.600
 But Jenny was hilarious because obviously,

00:46:58.600 --> 00:47:09.600
 I was screaming and yelling and having the time of my life.

00:47:09.600 --> 00:47:14.600
 When I looked back at Jenny's video,

00:47:14.600 --> 00:47:19.600
 and we were like, "Is she asleep?"

00:47:19.600 --> 00:47:23.600
 Like, she was so zen.

00:47:23.600 --> 00:47:24.600
 - Oh, really?

00:47:24.600 --> 00:47:27.600
 - Like, she said she enjoyed it.

00:47:27.600 --> 00:47:28.600
 - Oh, you did?

00:47:28.600 --> 00:47:30.600
 - I've been on a zipline only once,

00:47:30.600 --> 00:47:31.600
 and it was a tiny one.

00:47:31.600 --> 00:47:34.600
 It was one of those adventure places that you go to.

00:47:34.600 --> 00:47:37.600
 And I don't know what went wrong.

00:47:37.600 --> 00:47:40.600
 I don't know how I'd done my harness up incorrectly.

00:47:40.600 --> 00:47:45.600
 It sort of trapped my testicles in a really painful way.

00:47:45.600 --> 00:47:48.600
 So I go down the zipline screaming,

00:47:48.600 --> 00:47:50.600
 and I don't make it right to the end,

00:47:50.600 --> 00:47:52.600
 so I can't get my legs onto the thing.

00:47:52.600 --> 00:47:54.600
 And I am screaming like it's really hurting.

00:47:54.600 --> 00:47:56.600
 But unfortunately, the person I did it with

00:47:56.600 --> 00:47:58.600
 was my friend who's a comedian, Tom Davis,

00:47:58.600 --> 00:48:01.600
 who's a very sinister sense of humour,

00:48:01.600 --> 00:48:03.600
 and got everyone to step back

00:48:03.600 --> 00:48:06.600
 and let me just hang there while I was screaming.

00:48:06.600 --> 00:48:08.600
 There's a lot of photos that Tom has online

00:48:08.600 --> 00:48:12.600
 of me screaming with my testicles trapped in a...

00:48:12.600 --> 00:48:14.600
 Yeah, that's my only experience.

00:48:14.600 --> 00:48:15.600
 - Awful.

00:48:15.600 --> 00:48:16.600
 And you were sort of...

00:48:16.600 --> 00:48:20.600
 You were hanging there, ironically, like a testicle.

00:48:20.600 --> 00:48:22.600
 Like a huge testicle.

00:48:22.600 --> 00:48:25.600
 But your own testicles weren't free.

00:48:25.600 --> 00:48:26.600
 - That was the problem.

00:48:26.600 --> 00:48:27.600
 Makes you think, doesn't it?

00:48:27.600 --> 00:48:28.600
 - Let's make you think.

00:48:28.600 --> 00:48:29.600
 - James, have you been on a zipline?

00:48:29.600 --> 00:48:30.600
 - I have.

00:48:30.600 --> 00:48:31.600
 I was just thinking...

00:48:31.600 --> 00:48:33.600
 I've always liked Tom Davis.

00:48:33.600 --> 00:48:35.600
 I like him even more.

00:48:35.600 --> 00:48:38.600
 Yeah, now I have a few occasions.

00:48:38.600 --> 00:48:40.600
 - Well, the only ones that have been on a zipline.

00:48:40.600 --> 00:48:41.600
 - Around this table.

00:48:41.600 --> 00:48:45.600
 - Right, come on, we'll all go to work.

00:48:45.600 --> 00:48:51.600
 We'll all go change your name by the code.

00:48:51.600 --> 00:48:54.600
 We'll go zipline.

00:48:54.600 --> 00:48:58.600
 - I've been somewhere that has recently got permission for a zipline.

00:48:58.600 --> 00:48:59.600
 - Have you?

00:48:59.600 --> 00:49:03.600
 - But when I went there, they hadn't got the planning permission yet.

00:49:03.600 --> 00:49:05.600
 Honest to Slate Mine and the Lake District.

00:49:05.600 --> 00:49:07.600
 Just wanted to give a shout out to them.

00:49:07.600 --> 00:49:09.600
 They spent 10 years trying to get permission for a zipline.

00:49:09.600 --> 00:49:10.600
 10 years.

00:49:10.600 --> 00:49:11.600
 - Really?

00:49:11.600 --> 00:49:14.600
 - The council said, "No, this is beautiful here.

00:49:14.600 --> 00:49:15.600
 This old Slate Mine."

00:49:15.600 --> 00:49:19.600
 And I've got to tell you, it's not the place that would suffer irretrievable.

00:49:19.600 --> 00:49:20.600
 - Watch out, he's slating it.

00:49:20.600 --> 00:49:22.600
 - Oh, I enjoyed it.

00:49:22.600 --> 00:49:23.600
 I bought some souvenir Slate there.

00:49:23.600 --> 00:49:24.600
 I had a really good time.

00:49:24.600 --> 00:49:26.600
 It's a fun place to get.

00:49:26.600 --> 00:49:29.600
 I was there by myself and I had a really nice time to Slate Mine Walk.

00:49:29.600 --> 00:49:30.600
 It was brill.

00:49:30.600 --> 00:49:31.600
 - Lovely.

00:49:31.600 --> 00:49:35.600
 - But you do think the addition of one wire in the occasional person screaming as they pass.

00:49:35.600 --> 00:49:36.600
 - Yeah.

00:49:36.600 --> 00:49:37.600
 - Do you think?

00:49:37.600 --> 00:49:40.600
 - Well, you could think of the amount of Slate you could see in a short amount of time if

00:49:40.600 --> 00:49:41.600
 you had that zipline.

00:49:41.600 --> 00:49:42.600
 - Stop it.

00:49:42.600 --> 00:49:43.600
 Stop it.

00:49:43.600 --> 00:49:45.600
 You're trying to get me excited.

00:49:45.600 --> 00:49:46.600
 And it's working.

00:49:46.600 --> 00:49:49.600
 But it will be used to transport Slate in quiet periods.

00:49:49.600 --> 00:49:50.600
 - Is that right?

00:49:50.600 --> 00:49:51.600
 - Yeah, yeah.

00:49:51.600 --> 00:49:54.600
 I believe that's the arrangement they've come to.

00:49:54.600 --> 00:49:55.600
 - So it is going to happen?

00:49:55.600 --> 00:49:56.600
 - Yeah.

00:49:56.600 --> 00:49:57.600
 - Are you on a waiting list?

00:49:57.600 --> 00:49:58.600
 - Of course.

00:49:58.600 --> 00:49:59.600
 - Yeah.

00:49:59.600 --> 00:50:00.600
 - On a slating list.

00:50:00.600 --> 00:50:01.600
 - Oh, God.

00:50:01.600 --> 00:50:05.600
 - Anyway, just wanted to add my own personal anecdote.

00:50:05.600 --> 00:50:06.600
 - That's it.

00:50:06.600 --> 00:50:10.600
 - A very such good story that I wanted to talk to all of us.

00:50:10.600 --> 00:50:13.600
 - We know one of the dangers of going on a zipline.

00:50:13.600 --> 00:50:15.600
 I'm very glad you didn't get this.

00:50:15.600 --> 00:50:16.600
 - Tash!

00:50:16.600 --> 00:50:17.600
 They grow.

00:50:17.600 --> 00:50:18.600
 - Yes.

00:50:18.600 --> 00:50:19.600
 That's one of them.

00:50:19.600 --> 00:50:23.600
 - The other one is slamming into sloths.

00:50:23.600 --> 00:50:28.600
 So I've watched a video of a young boy in Costa Rica going down a zipline.

00:50:28.600 --> 00:50:31.600
 And behind him is either an instructor or a parent.

00:50:31.600 --> 00:50:32.600
 I don't quite know who.

00:50:32.600 --> 00:50:37.600
 And you see the video is just going super fast, super strong through this canopy.

00:50:37.600 --> 00:50:42.600
 And then suddenly you just see this ball of fur and he slams into it.

00:50:42.600 --> 00:50:46.600
 And fortunately the sloth doesn't lose grip, but they both stop.

00:50:46.600 --> 00:50:51.600
 And this sloth is just so confused and turns around.

00:50:51.600 --> 00:50:52.600
 - Was it all right?

00:50:52.600 --> 00:50:53.600
 - Yeah.

00:50:53.600 --> 00:50:54.600
 Well, it seemed to be okay.

00:50:54.600 --> 00:50:55.600
 It didn't drop.

00:50:55.600 --> 00:50:56.600
 Fortunately it was the boy.

00:50:56.600 --> 00:50:57.600
 - It was fine.

00:50:57.600 --> 00:50:58.600
 I saw that video as well.

00:50:58.600 --> 00:51:04.600
 And the person who was in charge, who was called Flavio Layton Ramos, he said the sloth or child

00:51:04.600 --> 00:51:05.600
 weren't hurt.

00:51:05.600 --> 00:51:10.600
 They just had to wait for the sloth to get out of the way for around 15 minutes.

00:51:10.600 --> 00:51:15.100
 - And you watch the sloth climbing away in this moment where its hands not on the wire

00:51:15.100 --> 00:51:16.100
 and it's taking so long.

00:51:16.100 --> 00:51:17.100
 - Oh, it's on the wire?

00:51:17.100 --> 00:51:18.100
 - Yeah, it's on the wire.

00:51:18.100 --> 00:51:20.100
 It's in the middle of the zip.

00:51:20.100 --> 00:51:21.100
 - Yeah.

00:51:21.100 --> 00:51:22.600
 So the zipline is going past a load of trees.

00:51:22.600 --> 00:51:26.600
 And so it's obviously been on one of the tree hanging branches and sort of thought this

00:51:26.600 --> 00:51:27.600
 was a branch.

00:51:27.600 --> 00:51:28.600
 - Yeah.

00:51:28.600 --> 00:51:29.600
 - Oh gosh.

00:51:29.600 --> 00:51:32.880
 - But it's literally, yeah, there's no tree near it for I guess 15 minutes because there's

00:51:32.880 --> 00:51:33.880
 no way for it.

00:51:33.880 --> 00:51:35.600
 It's got to just, it's like cliffhanger.

00:51:35.600 --> 00:51:36.600
 It was amazing.

00:51:36.600 --> 00:51:38.600
 The intro a cliffhanger.

00:51:38.600 --> 00:51:41.400
 - Isn't that where the zipline comes from, Costa Rica?

00:51:41.400 --> 00:51:44.880
 The modern zipline was invented there by a bloke called Donald Perry.

00:51:44.880 --> 00:51:45.880
 - That's right.

00:51:45.880 --> 00:51:50.980
 - He kind of studied the canopy and there was no good way of going from tree to tree.

00:51:50.980 --> 00:51:55.260
 So he turned up in 1979 with a crossbow, which is so cool.

00:51:55.260 --> 00:51:56.260
 - That is cool.

00:51:56.260 --> 00:51:59.260
 - He just started firing it around with a wire attached and bringing it up.

00:51:59.260 --> 00:52:00.260
 What a guy.

00:52:00.260 --> 00:52:05.380
 - They called him Hombrele Mono, which means Monkey Man in Costa Rica because he was using,

00:52:05.380 --> 00:52:07.820
 you know, just using all these wires to get around.

00:52:07.820 --> 00:52:08.820
 - So cool.

00:52:08.820 --> 00:52:09.820
 - Really cool.

00:52:09.820 --> 00:52:11.860
 - And he didn't patent it, I don't think.

00:52:11.860 --> 00:52:15.620
 So someone else came along, well, but someone else came along and did do that.

00:52:15.620 --> 00:52:20.880
 He was a sort of a businessman who wanted to make money off it and he was called Darren

00:52:20.880 --> 00:52:24.880
 Hrenyuk and he's a Canadian guy.

00:52:24.880 --> 00:52:31.280
 And when other people then started using ziplines, he used to go around and cut the ziplines

00:52:31.280 --> 00:52:32.280
 down.

00:52:32.280 --> 00:52:33.280
 - What?

00:52:33.280 --> 00:52:34.280
 - But he would do it claiming it in a legal way.

00:52:34.280 --> 00:52:39.000
 So in some cases he would bring, you know, a representative from a sort of official body

00:52:39.000 --> 00:52:41.000
 to sort of say, yes, this is a legal thing.

00:52:41.000 --> 00:52:45.280
 And so he'd go cutting these things down, even though he didn't have a claim to the invention

00:52:45.280 --> 00:52:48.700
 of it because it was very clearly from this Perry guy.

00:52:48.700 --> 00:52:49.700
 - Yeah.

00:52:49.700 --> 00:52:50.700
 - Wow.

00:52:50.700 --> 00:52:53.460
 - Can I tell you about a bloke called Jack Reynolds?

00:52:53.460 --> 00:52:54.460
 - Yes, please.

00:52:54.460 --> 00:52:59.500
 - Jack is the oldest man ever to use a zipline that we know of.

00:52:59.500 --> 00:53:00.500
 It was 2018.

00:53:00.500 --> 00:53:01.500
 He was 106 years old.

00:53:01.500 --> 00:53:02.500
 - Very cool.

00:53:02.500 --> 00:53:03.500
 - I know.

00:53:03.500 --> 00:53:05.100
 I've got to say, just a shout out to Jack Reynolds.

00:53:05.100 --> 00:53:10.540
 He's very sadly passed away, died in 2020, aged 108 in a bungee jump accident.

00:53:10.540 --> 00:53:11.540
 - Yeah.

00:53:11.540 --> 00:53:12.540
 - James, you joke.

00:53:12.540 --> 00:53:13.540
 - Oh, no.

00:53:13.540 --> 00:53:20.780
 - Yeah, but the year before the zipline, when he turned 105, he won oldest person to ride

00:53:20.780 --> 00:53:24.300
 a non-inversion roller coaster, which I love.

00:53:24.300 --> 00:53:25.300
 - Oh, yeah.

00:53:25.300 --> 00:53:27.760
 - That was Twisted Sorus at Flamingo Land in Malton.

00:53:27.760 --> 00:53:31.260
 On his 104th birthday, he got oldest person to receive their first tattoo.

00:53:31.260 --> 00:53:32.260
 - Oh.

00:53:32.260 --> 00:53:33.500
 - I remember this guy.

00:53:33.500 --> 00:53:34.500
 - 1912.

00:53:34.500 --> 00:53:35.500
 - Yeah.

00:53:35.500 --> 00:53:36.500
 - He was born.

00:53:36.500 --> 00:53:37.500
 It said Jack.

00:53:37.500 --> 00:53:38.840
 - Did he go skydiving as well?

00:53:38.840 --> 00:53:39.840
 - He went skydiving.

00:53:39.840 --> 00:53:40.840
 That was another thing he did.

00:53:40.840 --> 00:53:41.840
 - That's a good excuse.

00:53:41.840 --> 00:53:43.940
 Like if people say, "Why have you never had a tattoo?"

00:53:43.940 --> 00:53:44.940
 - Yeah.

00:53:44.940 --> 00:53:47.980
 - You'd say, "Well, I'm holding out to become the world's oldest man to have his tattoo."

00:53:47.980 --> 00:53:48.980
 - Yes.

00:53:48.980 --> 00:53:49.980
 - Yeah.

00:53:49.980 --> 00:53:50.980
 - Yeah.

00:53:50.980 --> 00:53:54.140
 - And at the age of 108, sorry, at the age of 107, so the year before he died, he became

00:53:54.140 --> 00:53:57.740
 the oldest person to, I think it was, have a cameo in a soap opera.

00:53:57.740 --> 00:53:58.980
 He had been in Hollyoaks.

00:53:58.980 --> 00:53:59.980
 - Oh.

00:53:59.980 --> 00:54:00.980
 - No.

00:54:00.980 --> 00:54:01.980
 - Yeah.

00:54:01.980 --> 00:54:02.980
 - It was.

00:54:02.980 --> 00:54:03.980
 - Does he work?

00:54:03.980 --> 00:54:04.980
 - He had one line.

00:54:04.980 --> 00:54:05.980
 He just said, "Don't worry.

00:54:05.980 --> 00:54:08.820
 I'm very old, and I've had a great life, and you'll be all right," and all of that.

00:54:08.820 --> 00:54:11.520
 - It was his first acting role in 100 years.

00:54:11.520 --> 00:54:14.840
 - So he'd had a previous one when he was seven.

00:54:14.840 --> 00:54:15.840
 - Yeah.

00:54:15.840 --> 00:54:16.840
 - No.

00:54:16.840 --> 00:54:17.840
 - What was it on?

00:54:17.840 --> 00:54:18.840
 - I don't know.

00:54:18.840 --> 00:54:21.840
 - He was on a train approaching the Garden Hall, wasn't he?

00:54:21.840 --> 00:54:22.840
 That's amazing.

00:54:22.840 --> 00:54:23.840
 The Hollyoaks.

00:54:23.840 --> 00:54:24.840
 - I know.

00:54:24.840 --> 00:54:26.340
 Hollyoaks as well, which is such a young show.

00:54:26.340 --> 00:54:27.340
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:54:27.340 --> 00:54:35.480
 - That IMDB, though, just with a 100-year difference, two credits.

00:54:35.480 --> 00:54:37.760
 - When was he on Hollyoaks?

00:54:37.760 --> 00:54:40.580
 - That was the year before he died, so it would have been 2019.

00:54:40.580 --> 00:54:41.580
 - Okay.

00:54:41.580 --> 00:54:42.580
 Cool.

00:54:42.580 --> 00:54:43.580
 - Yeah, yeah.

00:54:43.580 --> 00:54:44.580
 Watch.

00:54:44.580 --> 00:54:45.580
 How are they?

00:54:45.580 --> 00:54:48.060
 - I have a friend who actually died over Christmas in Hollyoaks.

00:54:48.060 --> 00:54:49.060
 - Oh.

00:54:49.060 --> 00:54:50.060
 - In Hollyoaks.

00:54:50.060 --> 00:54:51.060
 - In Hollyoaks.

00:54:51.060 --> 00:54:52.060
 - Yeah.

00:54:52.060 --> 00:54:53.060
 - Okay.

00:54:53.060 --> 00:54:54.060
 - Yeah.

00:54:54.060 --> 00:54:56.360
 And she got crushed by a bookcase.

00:54:56.360 --> 00:55:04.580
 - By a 108-year-old man who's parachute didn't open.

00:55:04.580 --> 00:55:11.800
 - Okay, that's it.

00:55:11.800 --> 00:55:12.800
 That is all of our facts.

00:55:12.800 --> 00:55:14.040
