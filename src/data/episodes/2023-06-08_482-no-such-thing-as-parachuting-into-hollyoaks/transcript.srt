00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,760
 Hi everyone, welcome to this week's episode of No Such Thing as a Fish, where we are joined by one of our favourite, favourite people in the world, Rosie Jones.

2
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:17,860
 Now, those of you in the UK will not need to hear an introduction for Rosie, because she is one of the great comedians of our time.

3
00:00:17,860 --> 00:00:29,040
 Any of you who've watched QI, which I know is a lot of you will recognise her, she's been on all sorts of stuff, so she kind of came into the limelight on the last leg and worked on the Paralympics.

4
00:00:29,040 --> 00:00:44,760
 You'll hear a lot about that in this show. She's a writer as well, she wrote for the Netflix show Sex Education, she's written a brilliant children's book called The Amazing E.D. Eckhart, which is about an 11 year old with cerebral palsy.

5
00:00:44,760 --> 00:00:53,440
 She's just an all-round, very, very funny person, and I really, really hope you'll enjoy this week's show. I'm absolutely certain you will. It's one of my favourites that we've ever done, I think.

6
00:00:53,440 --> 00:01:07,760
 If you want to see Rosie in real life, then I think her tour has, I think it's literally just started maybe this week, and if you want to go and see that, you can go to rosyjonescomedy.com and all the dates are up there. Rosie is R-O-S-I-E.

7
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:13,080
 And that's all to say, really. I really hope you enjoy this show with Rosie, and on with the podcast.

8
00:01:13,480 --> 00:01:27,480
 [Music]

9
00:01:27,480 --> 00:01:35,880
 Hello, and welcome to another episode of No Such Thing as a Fish, a weekly podcast coming to you from the QI officers in Hoburn.

10
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:41,800
 My name is Dan Schreiber, I am sitting here with James Harkin, Andrew Hunter Murray, and Rosie Jones.

11
00:01:41,800 --> 00:01:50,400
 And once again, we have gathered round the microphones with our four favourite facts from the last seven days, and in no particular order, here we go.

12
00:01:50,400 --> 00:02:04,800
 Starting with fact number one, that is my fact. My fact this week is that the world's greatest Paralympic equestrian, with 14 gold medals under his belt, is also allergic to horses.

13
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:11,000
 That's not his Paralympic qualification, that's not the disability that means, okay, okay.

14
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:25,800
 Absolutely, no, it's not. So yeah, this is an extraordinary guy called Lee Pearson, who has over the years won 14 gold medals, a bunch of bronze and silver along the way as well, and he's just an amazing character, generally.

15
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:32,000
 I mean, I want to, I'll mention a couple of things, I'm really excited to ask whether or not you've met him, because I know you've been to the Paralympics, right?

16
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:46,200
 But so he's the kind of guy who says like my training is curry, Malibu and Coke, and, you know, and he loves to party, and he's got a life story, which is, you know, he was born and put into a broom cupboard as soon as he was born.

17
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:50,200
 We've got to say, okay, we've got to, yeah, can I unpick this?

18
00:02:50,200 --> 00:03:03,000
 So he was born with a condition which I'd never heard of before, it's called a thyrogryposis multiplex congenitor. I think I've said that right. I think that was known when he was born, and he wasn't looked after especially well by the hospital he was in.

19
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:15,000
 So he was put into a cupboard for a few days in a sort of crib thing, and his mum was heavily sedated so that they didn't know she was trying to find out where he was when she eventually, you know, came around.

20
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:26,800
 And as a result, he has no muscles in his arms. So he does, he does the dressage with his shoulders. That's what he pulls with to control. And he got into horse riding because he couldn't ride a bike. So that's the, that's the basics.

21
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:28,800
 Is he, sorry, is he British or is he?

22
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:38,800
 He is, yeah, he's also gay. And as a result, the headline on the story that I read was out of two closets and into Paralympic history.

23
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:54,600
 That's amazing. But so just to end the broom cupboard story is that he he's left there for three days. Finally, the dad comes to visit the mum is where's my baby and they go find the baby and they half kind of think they're going to find a dying baby, but he's doing okay.

24
00:03:54,600 --> 00:04:02,600
 And the mum has to play it cool because for some reason she just wanted to not make a big deal out of it, worrying that they might then take him away because of her emotion.

25
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:16,600
 And so, yeah. And so he should have died according to the nurses. So his life story from the get go is just a phenomenal moment. And he was kind of a young kid who experienced a lot of interesting moments along the way.

26
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:29,600
 Like there's a story that Margaret Thatcher carried up the staircase at 10 Downing Street when he was being presented an award when he was six years old for children of courage. So he's always been sort of in the limelight and he's a huge advocate of gay.

27
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:42,600
 Thatcher is needs. Yeah. But yeah, he's, you know, when when the Paralympics were going to be happening in Russia, he wanted to go and explicitly talk about gay rights.

28
00:04:42,600 --> 00:05:05,600
 It's a really cool guy, he seems. He is amazing. And yeah, I've met him because I've been to two Paralympics now because before I was a comedian, I was a researcher in telly.

29
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:27,600
 So in 2016, I went to Rio to work on the last leg. And then in 2021, I went to Tokyo again with the last leg.

30
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:47,600
 But this time, I was on telly. So I was the correspondent out there and they tell me to shut up because it's not a fact.

31
00:05:47,600 --> 00:06:10,600
 And but I just wanted to say how both the time to get into the Paralympics, I've had incredible emotional journeys because I've been disabled all my life.

32
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:35,600
 I don't mind it. I love the life and the world I created, but it can be exhausting going into rooms all day every day when you're normally the only disabled person.

33
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:50,600
 So you get this disabled paradise where actually, if you're able-bodied, you look weird.

34
00:06:50,600 --> 00:07:03,600
 It's such an emotional feeling to know that we're not alone and we're in this all together.

35
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:18,600
 But what I wanted to say was, I met Lee at both games and he is brilliant.

36
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:39,600
 We once interviewed him and he was naked in bed. Like, he did not care. It just sounds so cool. I love that he learned to ride on horses, not on the horse, but on a donkey.

37
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:43,600
 That was his first experience. A donkey called Sally.

38
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:51,600
 In ancient China, no, not ancient China, but early modern China, the women polo players would play on donkeys.

39
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:55,600
 So the male polo players would play on horses and the women would play on donkeys.

40
00:07:55,600 --> 00:08:04,600
 And it was because it's quite a high status thing. It was like very posh people who would play and they just thought it was safer really because you're closer to the ground.

41
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:11,600
 And I guess that's why you practice to do your equestrian on donkeys as well because they're slower and closer to the ground.

42
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:18,600
 Yeah, there is a lot of horse allergy in Paralympic athletes, horse riding athletes.

43
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:23,600
 Yeah, there's Sophie Wells. She won silver in 2012. She's allergic to horses.

44
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:30,600
 But I read that and I read an article with her that said because she was allergic to horses, her mother had to brush down the pony when she was a child.

45
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:36,600
 It does sound to me like she's like, "Oh, no, I can't muck her out. I can't brush her down. I'm allergic."

46
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:41,600
 I'm also allergic to dutch.

47
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:43,600
 Making birds, I can't.

48
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:49,600
 The other thing about her, Sophie Wells, is she went to school at somewhere called the Robert Pattinson Academy.

49
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:51,600
 Really?

50
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:52,600
 No.

51
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:53,600
 Isn't that amazing?

52
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:55,600
 Only open at Twilight.

53
00:08:55,600 --> 00:09:01,600
 And it's named after Sir Robert Pattinson, who was an MP for Grantham in the 1920s.

54
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:03,600
 Margaret Thatcher's old constituency.

55
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:08,600
 The wrong link between Paralympic dressage and Margaret Thatcher.

56
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:11,600
 Sophie Wells, the rival of Sophie Wells. So Sophie Wells won silver in 2012.

57
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:14,600
 Her rival who took gold was called Michael George.

58
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:16,600
 Now, if my surname was Michael...

59
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:21,600
 No, if my surname was George and I had a son, I'm not sure I'd call him Michael.

60
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:22,600
 Why?

61
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:24,600
 Because it's George Michael's.

62
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:27,600
 I was two fast names, but I'm thinking it's like a George Michael reference.

63
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:30,600
 If they stood next to each other, they'd be a palindrome.

64
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:33,600
 You didn't pick up on someone called Michael George having a name like George Michael?

65
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:34,600
 No.

66
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:35,600
 I didn't.

67
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:36,600
 No.

68
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:37,600
 Am I the only one here?

69
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:38,600
 No, I didn't.

70
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:39,600
 Oh, thank you.

71
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:40,600
 It was the first thing I saw.

72
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:48,600
 I first thought was what Tory MP is.

73
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:51,600
 It was Ian Thatcher's cabinet.

74
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:54,600
 I went to the Sydney Paralympics.

75
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:55,600
 Did you?

76
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:56,600
 Yeah, it was awesome.

77
00:09:56,600 --> 00:09:57,600
 I don't actually have much memory.

78
00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:01,600
 We sat in Homebush, which is the big stadium that was built for it.

79
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:05,600
 The Paralympics wasn't a big deal in the country.

80
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:07,600
 The Olympics was such a big deal.

81
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:08,600
 It was the year 2000.

82
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:13,600
 And I remember on the day, my impressions of it were the stadium was virtually empty.

83
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:16,600
 It was a lot of school excursions, which is what we were on.

84
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:18,600
 And the music that they were playing over the sound system.

85
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:23,600
 And these are all people are doing their big Olympic events were kids' songs like "Row, Row, Row Your Boat" and stuff.

86
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:28,600
 And I just remember thinking, is that during the rowing event?

87
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:29,600
 Good motivation.

88
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:33,600
 But I just remember sitting there thinking, these are professional athletes who've spent

89
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:35,600
 four years getting to this point.

90
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:36,600
 And they've got nursery rhymes play.

91
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:37,600
 It was really odd.

92
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:42,600
 And now it's kind of like the opening closing ceremonies will have cold play and they'll

93
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:43,600
 have Michael George.

94
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:44,600
 Michael George?

95
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:51,600
 Doing Whisper Curlis.

96
00:10:51,600 --> 00:11:01,600
 The first Paralympic Games were in Rome in 1960.

97
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:11,600
 And they had a few games that unfortunately no longer happened.

98
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:26,600
 My favorite was a sport called "Darchery" which is exactly what it sounds like.

99
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:29,600
 It was archery.

100
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:31,600
 In a pub.

101
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:48,600
 That's a great idea.

102
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:56,600
 But what's crazy is archery has a very big, effectively a large dartboard, doesn't it?

103
00:11:56,600 --> 00:11:59,600
 So that's making archery 10 times harder.

104
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:03,600
 And suddenly your place of aim is a dartboard.

105
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:05,600
 That's, oh yeah.

106
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:07,600
 You've got less surface area for...

107
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:09,600
 Was it the size of a dartboard?

108
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:10,600
 I think so.

109
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:12,600
 I thought it was literally a dartboard.

110
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:16,600
 If your normal arrow for an archery, if you find that it's something the size of a dartboard,

111
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:19,600
 it's going to go in numerous different numbers at the same time.

112
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:20,600
 That's what I was confused about.

113
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:22,600
 But you've raised a really good point.

114
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:23,600
 What if it was bigger?

115
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:28,600
 I was reading about visually impaired skiing, which I think is amazing.

116
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:32,600
 Because you're skiing down, and then there's someone else who's skiing in front of you,

117
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:35,600
 and they're attached by Bluetooth.

118
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:38,600
 So they're telling you what's coming all the way down.

119
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:40,600
 And then you have to ski behind them.

120
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:42,600
 Wait, so they're not attached physically?

121
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:43,600
 They're not physically attached.

122
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:45,600
 They're a guide, and they have like headphones.

123
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:51,600
 But like, how hard is it to attach your headphones to your phone by a Bluetooth?

124
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:56,600
 That must be terrifying to just like your Bluetooth is now disconnected.

125
00:12:56,600 --> 00:12:57,600
 Oh fuck!

126
00:12:57,600 --> 00:12:59,600
 What if you then connect to someone else?

127
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:01,600
 Getting the wrong info.

128
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:06,600
 I just think that must be absolutely terrifying.

129
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:12,600
 Visual impairment is such an interesting territory about how there's assists just for that tiny bit of guidance.

130
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:16,600
 So for swimming, there's a thing called the tapper, where when you're coming,

131
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:20,600
 they'll tap a swimmer on the head to let them know that the end is coming up.

132
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:27,600
 And it's so basically as the swimmer, who is visually impaired, you can just swim at full pelt,

133
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:31,600
 and you'll know that the end's coming up, so you don't have this uncertainty ahead of you.

134
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:33,600
 But I think that has a big responsibility on the tapper.

135
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:34,600
 Absolutely.

136
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:36,600
 You've got to get that in one.

137
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:37,600
 You've got to get that bag on it.

138
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:40,600
 And you have to agree what the thing is before you start the race.

139
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:41,600
 What the distance is.

140
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:42,600
 I'm sure they do, Andy.

141
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:44,600
 I'm starting to not just wing it.

142
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:49,600
 So I'm going to try and tap you one centimetre before the edge of the...

143
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:50,600
 ...the edge of the ear.

144
00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:59,600
 But you laugh, but there was an incredible swim in Rio,

145
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:02,600
 and it had no arms.

146
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:03,600
 Oh, yes.

147
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:05,600
 And no legs.

148
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:17,600
 And his way of stopping in the pool was literally to hit the head.

149
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:20,600
 So good.

150
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:27,600
 By the end of it, it must have a brain damage as well.

151
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:29,600
 Was he wearing like a helmet or something?

152
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:30,600
 No.

153
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:31,600
 Oh my God.

154
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:32,600
 No.

155
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:33,600
 That's amazing.

156
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:43,600
 Also, what I love about the Paralympics is all the different groups.

157
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:44,600
 Yes.

158
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:52,600
 There's a million groups and a group on ability,

159
00:14:52,600 --> 00:15:00,600
 and I think that's why I love it more than the Olympics,

160
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:10,600
 because you know that everyone in that race is the same sort of ability.

161
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:11,600
 Oh, yeah.

162
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:13,600
 I didn't know about the classification thing.

163
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:16,600
 And it's why there are so many events, as it were,

164
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:21,600
 because you've got ten classes of disability from the least to the most impaired.

165
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:31,600
 Well, yeah, but you get different classes of swimming, different classes of running.

166
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:45,600
 You just need it because you cannot have a visually impaired person next to an amputee.

167
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:49,600
 You can't have someone with no arms and legs against someone who's allergic to horses.

168
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:53,600
 But I think it's right that so within class seven or whatever it is,

169
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:55,600
 there will be different kinds of impairment.

170
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:58,600
 So you might have someone who's got a limb which is shorter

171
00:15:58,600 --> 00:16:00,600
 or someone who's got impaired muscle power,

172
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:02,600
 or someone who's shorter,

173
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:06,600
 but they have been assessed as being the same level of impairment.

174
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:09,600
 And what it means to the winner is whoever's the best on the day.

175
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:10,600
 Yeah.

176
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:16,600
 I like to set up rivalry with rivalry.

177
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:27,600
 So obviously the Paralympics countries compete in against each other.

178
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:35,600
 But when I went to Tokyo, I set up Team CP.

179
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:44,600
 So I only supported people with cerebral palsy.

180
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:56,600
 And if there was anyone with, like, ME, I'd be like, "Get away! You're not, I grew!"

181
00:16:56,600 --> 00:16:59,600
 I think it's the spirit of the Paralympics really right there.

182
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:06,600
 What visually impaired person?

183
00:17:06,600 --> 00:17:17,600
 Okay, it is time for fact number two, and that is Rosie.

184
00:17:17,600 --> 00:17:38,600
 A man from Yorkshire once changed his name by default to Yorkshire Bank PLC, a fascist bastard.

185
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:41,600
 Lovely!

186
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:46,600
 Now, for avoidance of that, we're not saying that Yorkshire Bank PLC are fascist bastards.

187
00:17:46,600 --> 00:17:51,600
 No, they don't know one man saying that.

188
00:17:51,600 --> 00:18:00,600
 And his name is Yorkshire Bank fascist bastard.

189
00:18:00,600 --> 00:18:03,600
 So are we going to call him Mr Bastards?

190
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:13,600
 Well actually, a brother to his friends is known as Yorkshire.

191
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:21,600
 Has he stuck with it?

192
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:37,600
 I tried to look and I can't find it, but I like to think that Yorkshire's out there enjoying Yorkshire and hating Yorkshire Bank.

193
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:45,600
 I reckon he's probably now called, like, United Utilities of Fascist Bastards, or, you know, the Royal Mail of Fascist Bastards.

194
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:47,600
 He probably just keeps doing it.

195
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:50,600
 Because actually, he's changed his name to, what, that six words.

196
00:18:50,600 --> 00:18:54,600
 So four of those are middle names, so he will look like he's just called Yorkshire Bastards.

197
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:56,600
 Well, we don't know if Fascist Bastards is a double bound.

198
00:18:56,600 --> 00:18:58,600
 Oh yeah, it could be.

199
00:18:58,600 --> 00:19:02,600
 I always picture this going to a depot, because I need to change my name to something...

200
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:05,600
 Let's say a lot of actors do it right, where a name's taken, so they pick something quite normal,

201
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:08,600
 and you're standing in the queue, and the person in front of you is like, oh, what are you changing it to?

202
00:19:08,600 --> 00:19:11,600
 And you're like, oh, Yorkshire Bank of Fascist Bastards?

203
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:14,600
 Oh, that's pretty cool. Guy behind you. What are you changing it to?

204
00:19:14,600 --> 00:19:17,600
 Oh, you know, Rainbow Sunshine, Lollipops. Oh, god damn it.

205
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:19,600
 And I imagine I would just keep coming out with a different name.

206
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:22,600
 I'd buckle under, like, the influence.

207
00:19:22,600 --> 00:19:24,600
 Because you came in just to call yourself Don Shriver.

208
00:19:24,600 --> 00:19:26,600
 Yeah, exactly. I'm not a Don Shriver.

209
00:19:26,600 --> 00:19:30,600
 I'm leading as Indiana Jones, Platypus, Orange Man, whatever.

210
00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:43,600
 I've got an idea. I think after this, we should all go and change our names to a job.

211
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:44,600
 Oh, that's a great idea.

212
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:47,600
 I don't mind being Rosie Jones. A lot more work.

213
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:51,600
 His real name was Michael Howard.

214
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:52,600
 Yeah.

215
00:19:52,600 --> 00:19:54,600
 The ex-conservative leader.

216
00:19:54,600 --> 00:19:56,600
 Was Howard big in the 90s?

217
00:19:56,600 --> 00:19:58,600
 Huge. Yeah, I don't know.

218
00:19:58,600 --> 00:20:02,600
 That was when he was a minister, because the conservatives were in government at the time.

219
00:20:02,600 --> 00:20:03,600
 So, yeah, he was a big deal at the time.

220
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:07,600
 So extra incentive to change from Michael Howard if you didn't want to be.

221
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:12,600
 But the report from the time is so good, because he asked for his balance at the bank,

222
00:20:12,600 --> 00:20:16,600
 69 pence, to be returned to him by check.

223
00:20:16,600 --> 00:20:18,600
 And a spokeswoman for the bank had to say,

224
00:20:18,600 --> 00:20:23,600
 "The relationship with Mr. Howard has irretrievably broken down, and we very much regret that."

225
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:26,600
 And he said, "Sorry, who do you talk to? Mr. Howard, who's he?"

226
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:28,600
 Conservatively, no.

227
00:20:28,600 --> 00:20:32,600
 I love Rosie. The link you sent over was from a Guardian article, which was called

228
00:20:32,600 --> 00:20:36,600
 "It's a Funny Old World, 1999," and this was published in November.

229
00:20:36,600 --> 00:20:39,600
 And just the other examples are there, just to read one or two of them.

230
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:41,600
 There was this great one in Sydney.

231
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:47,600
 120 men named Henry attacked each other during a "My name is Henry" convention.

232
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:52,600
 Henry Panty of Canberra accused Henry Pap of Sydney of not being a Henry at all.

233
00:20:52,600 --> 00:20:54,600
 But in fact, an Angus.

234
00:20:54,600 --> 00:20:57,600
 "It was a lie," explained Mr. Pap. "I'm a Henry, and always will be."

235
00:20:57,600 --> 00:21:03,600
 Whereupon Henry Pap attacked Henry Panty, whilst two other Henrys, Jones and Dyer, attempted to pull them apart.

236
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:06,600
 Several more Henrys, Smith, Calderwood and Andrews, became involved,

237
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:10,600
 and soon the entire convention descended into a giant fist fight.

238
00:21:10,600 --> 00:21:12,600
 I want to have a hoovered up after that.

239
00:21:12,600 --> 00:21:19,600
 The final line, the brawl was eventually broken up by riot police, led by a man named...

240
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:22,600
 - Henry! - Shane.

241
00:21:22,600 --> 00:21:24,600
 Well, he was Australian.

242
00:21:24,600 --> 00:21:26,600
 Rosie, you're from Yorkshire, aren't you?

243
00:21:26,600 --> 00:21:32,600
 Yes. I'm proud of Yorkshire Lady,

244
00:21:32,600 --> 00:21:41,600
 and I think we get a reputation of being tight bats.

245
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:47,600
 But I wanted to call me and say,

246
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:54,600
 actually, that reputation isn't even true,

247
00:21:54,600 --> 00:22:06,600
 because I was a survey done that said more than 60% of Yorkshire folks

248
00:22:06,600 --> 00:22:23,600
 never use a rubber draft, and 3/4 of people from Yorkshire put up to £200 a month aside.

249
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:30,600
 So we forgot the money going on.

250
00:22:30,600 --> 00:22:33,600
 Wait, are you Yorkshire ambassador? Are you trying to change...

251
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:35,600
 - Yes. - Is that where you're here?

252
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:40,600
 - On the agenda. - Yeah, come table or dinner.

253
00:22:40,600 --> 00:22:42,600
 All that says to me, Rosie,

254
00:22:42,600 --> 00:22:44,600
 if they're not going into their overdraft and they're saving money,

255
00:22:44,600 --> 00:22:47,600
 is that they're not spending any money on it.

256
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:51,600
 There's a weird fact I found which kind of combines the name-changers and the money thing.

257
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:54,600
 So is it pronounced Connysborough in Yorkshire?

258
00:22:54,600 --> 00:22:55,600
 - Yeah. - Connysborough, okay.

259
00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:58,600
 So there's a place in Yorkshire called Connysborough,

260
00:22:58,600 --> 00:23:01,600
 which has a road in it, which is called Butthole Road.

261
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:06,600
 - Okay. - Lovely.

262
00:23:06,600 --> 00:23:08,600
 They didn't love it.

263
00:23:08,600 --> 00:23:11,600
 It was probably named after a water butt that used to be in the road.

264
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:16,600
 I mean, perfectly innocent, normal, not funny, you know, but three words, Butthole Road.

265
00:23:16,600 --> 00:23:18,600
 - I don't know if that wasn't funny. - I know, I know.

266
00:23:18,600 --> 00:23:21,600
 Well, the thing is, they were getting a lot of prank calls.

267
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:25,600
 They were getting tourists turning up with their arses out and that kind of stuff.

268
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:28,600
 Taxi drivers point blank refused to believe it was a rickshaw.

269
00:23:28,600 --> 00:23:31,600
 They wouldn't take you there. There were tour buses turning.

270
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:36,600
 I mean, it was quite quiet tours, I guess, but...

271
00:23:36,600 --> 00:23:42,600
 One family actually sold up and moved in 2003 because they were so annoyed about the jokes.

272
00:23:42,600 --> 00:23:45,600
 The new owner of the house, Peter Sutton, said he knows what to expect

273
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:47,600
 and he's looking forward to moving in.

274
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:49,600
 (LAUGHTER)

275
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:51,600
 - Yeah, dude. - I know.

276
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:57,600
 It's very sadly for our purposes, they changed the name of the street.

277
00:23:57,600 --> 00:24:00,600
 - 2009 to Archer's Way. - That's what.

278
00:24:00,600 --> 00:24:01,600
 (LAUGHTER)

279
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:04,600
 But the council refused to replace the street sign for free,

280
00:24:04,600 --> 00:24:07,600
 which I don't know if that plays into the other Yorkshire stereotype.

281
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:09,600
 (LAUGHTER)

282
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:14,600
 Also, there's a village that I've never been to,

283
00:24:14,600 --> 00:24:21,600
 but I see signs for it called the Land of Nod.

284
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:24,600
 - Really? The Land of Nod? - Yeah.

285
00:24:24,600 --> 00:24:27,600
 - That's quite nice. - It's in the Bible, isn't the Land of Nod?

286
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:30,600
 It's the place east of Eden where they get sent off to, I think...

287
00:24:30,600 --> 00:24:32,600
 - Really? - There's lots of houses around the Bible.

288
00:24:32,600 --> 00:24:35,600
 - Is that where they call it God's Own Country? - Yorkshire?

289
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:37,600
 - Yeah. - No, it's because they're deluded.

290
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:39,600
 - Oh, sorry. - OK.

291
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:43,600
 - Oh, I'm starting jumping now. - I'm from Lancashire, sorry.

292
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:45,600
 - Yeah, do you have rivalries? - Oh, yeah.

293
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:47,600
 - Oh, yeah. - Oh, yeah.

294
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:50,600
 - Have you heard of a little thing called the Wars of the Roses?

295
00:24:50,600 --> 00:24:53,600
 - Because... - OK.

296
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:56,600
 - It's still ongoing. - Yeah.

297
00:24:56,600 --> 00:25:02,600
 Actually, my mum and dad are from Lancashire.

298
00:25:02,600 --> 00:25:04,600
 - Are they? Oh, you're not... - No.

299
00:25:04,600 --> 00:25:07,600
 - Peace offering has occurred so quickly. - Yeah.

300
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:10,600
 - Sorry, Rosie, so you're from Bridlington, right? - Yeah.

301
00:25:10,600 --> 00:25:13,600
 They have 21 fish and chip takeaways

302
00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:17,600
 within a five-minute walk of the centre of Bridlington, right?

303
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:22,600
 And I call that a challenge.

304
00:25:22,600 --> 00:25:24,600
 The problem is you have so much fish and chips

305
00:25:24,600 --> 00:25:27,600
 that also means you have a lot of seagulls, right?

306
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:30,600
 I was reading the Bridlington Echo,

307
00:25:30,600 --> 00:25:34,600
 and it's a recurring story about the problems with seagulls.

308
00:25:34,600 --> 00:25:37,600
 The Royal Mail had to warn residents

309
00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:39,600
 that they wouldn't be getting their postal deliveries

310
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:42,600
 because seagulls kept attacking postal workers.

311
00:25:42,600 --> 00:25:44,600
 - Oh, wow. - And there was a bank that was closed

312
00:25:44,600 --> 00:25:48,600
 because nesting seagulls had caused a leak in the roof.

313
00:25:48,600 --> 00:25:52,600
 And the Bridlington Fire Station had to rescue a stranded seagull

314
00:25:52,600 --> 00:25:56,600
 after it sat on top of a metal lamp post for too long in the winter.

315
00:25:56,600 --> 00:25:58,600
 - So it's, you know... - Wait, did it get...

316
00:25:58,600 --> 00:26:01,600
 Sorry, just to burrow down into that one a bit.

317
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:03,600
 - Was it frozen onto the... - I'm afraid...

318
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:05,600
 You know, like when you put your tongue on a metal...

319
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:08,600
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. - Well, apparently, if you're a seagull,

320
00:26:08,600 --> 00:26:10,600
 - it works with your feet as well. - Oh, no.

321
00:26:10,600 --> 00:26:13,600
 - How do they rescue it? - Well, with the tongue,

322
00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:15,600
 you usually pour, like, lukewarm water.

323
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:18,600
 - Yeah, yeah. - Imagine they did something similar.

324
00:26:18,600 --> 00:26:22,600
 - Yeah, definitely, yeah. - I think they're so great,

325
00:26:22,600 --> 00:26:27,600
 but I think what that shows some more than anything

326
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:33,600
 is shit all happens in Bridlington.

327
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:35,600
 - Yeah. - Well, there was a big story recently.

328
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:38,600
 A woman called Susan Radford, she was a grandma,

329
00:26:38,600 --> 00:26:41,600
 and she spoke out against sexually explicit sweets

330
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:44,600
 that were on sale on the seafront.

331
00:26:44,600 --> 00:26:46,600
 - Do we have any examples? - Yeah, come on.

332
00:26:46,600 --> 00:26:49,600
 - Well, you know, like rock, like solid sugar? - Yeah, stick a rock.

333
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:52,600
 - Oh, you mean, like, the shape of it? - In the shape of...

334
00:26:52,600 --> 00:26:56,600
 - Oh, what? - Of penises, Rosie.

335
00:26:56,600 --> 00:27:00,600
 - Oh, yeah, yeah. What do you think?

336
00:27:00,600 --> 00:27:04,600
 - I knew! I knew!

337
00:27:04,600 --> 00:27:07,600
 - And she was so upset that she's...

338
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:10,600
 She got in touch with the local Anglican church

339
00:27:10,600 --> 00:27:12,600
 to help her complaint,

340
00:27:12,600 --> 00:27:15,600
 and she said she's not going to visit Bridlington again

341
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:18,600
 until they get rid of the rocks. - She's not from Bridlington.

342
00:27:18,600 --> 00:27:21,600
 - No? She just went on a holiday one day, saw them,

343
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:23,600
 and went, "I'm not coming back here again."

344
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:24,600
 - Wow. - Good!

345
00:27:24,600 --> 00:27:27,600
 We don't need her!

346
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:31,600
 - I saw a couple of articles where it said Bridlington

347
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:34,600
 voted one of the worst towns in the UK and stuff,

348
00:27:34,600 --> 00:27:37,600
 but everyone who then went to ride up on it came out going,

349
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:39,600
 "It's awesome here. What are you talking about?"

350
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:42,600
 Who said that this was bad? I haven't been myself, so I don't know.

351
00:27:42,600 --> 00:27:44,600
 But the pictures, it looks kind of pretty.

352
00:27:44,600 --> 00:27:54,600
 - I mean, I think Bridlington is very good if you're under five

353
00:27:54,600 --> 00:27:58,600
 and you're over 85. - Right, okay.

354
00:27:58,600 --> 00:28:02,600
 - In between, there's not a lot to do.

355
00:28:02,600 --> 00:28:06,600
 - It's a pretty rough message to hear on your sixth birthday in Bridlington.

356
00:28:06,600 --> 00:28:12,600
 - Get out now, Friday, get out!

357
00:28:12,600 --> 00:28:15,600
 - Can I quickly tell you a couple of Yorkshire world records?

358
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:18,600
 - Yes. - Very proud Yorkshire world records.

359
00:28:18,600 --> 00:28:22,600
 Fastest time to make a litre of ice cream, which was 10 seconds.

360
00:28:22,600 --> 00:28:24,600
 - Wow. - Andrew Ross.

361
00:28:24,600 --> 00:28:27,600
 But the ingredients did include liquid nitrogen, so I feel like there was some...

362
00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:29,600
 - Yeah. - Cheat.

363
00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:33,600
 - Yeah. World's loudest clap.

364
00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:38,600
 - Okay. - Are we talking about the action?

365
00:28:38,600 --> 00:28:43,600
 - We're not talking about the disease.

366
00:28:43,600 --> 00:28:46,600
 So painful you could hear him screaming for miles.

367
00:28:46,600 --> 00:28:48,600
 "I've got the clap!"

368
00:28:48,600 --> 00:28:54,600
 - No, I once read, I don't know if this is true, that the name "the clap" came...

369
00:28:54,600 --> 00:29:00,600
 This is awful, that they used to put your penis between two pieces of wood

370
00:29:00,600 --> 00:29:05,600
 and then whack them together and it would get the discharge out of the...

371
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:10,600
 - Right, we're talking about a seven-year-old girl here, so I hope you're all very proud of yourselves.

372
00:29:10,600 --> 00:29:12,600
 - I think that might be true, but I'm not sure.

373
00:29:12,600 --> 00:29:14,600
 - I think that's to cure a different thing.

374
00:29:14,600 --> 00:29:17,600
 I think there's a thing called peoria where the penis starts to bend,

375
00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:20,600
 and it happens increasingly as you get older and it's incredibly painful,

376
00:29:20,600 --> 00:29:22,600
 and there are now ways of dealing with it, but...

377
00:29:22,600 --> 00:29:27,600
 - Also, if your penis isn't flat enough, that'll be fine.

378
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:30,600
 - Can we get back to this? Poor kid.

379
00:29:30,600 --> 00:29:33,600
 - Sorry, what was this? A young girl, seven years old.

380
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:35,600
 - Martha Gibson, she was clapping.

381
00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:37,600
 - Her family noticed, she's got an incredibly loud clap.

382
00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:42,600
 You know, some people, they really have these hollow space in their hands,

383
00:29:42,600 --> 00:29:47,600
 and it's apparently the equivalent of a heavy goods vehicle passing by, 73 decibels,

384
00:29:47,600 --> 00:29:49,600
 and they got someone from Guinness to measure it.

385
00:29:49,600 --> 00:29:50,600
 - So a seven-year-old?

386
00:29:50,600 --> 00:29:54,600
 - Yeah, and maybe there's someone louder who hasn't been officially Guinness-approved measured.

387
00:29:54,600 --> 00:29:57,600
 Anyway, she was born in 1998, which means she's out there somewhere.

388
00:29:57,600 --> 00:29:58,600
 - Yeah.

389
00:29:58,600 --> 00:29:59,600
 - You know, she's in her 20s now.

390
00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:00,600
 I don't know if she's still...

391
00:30:00,600 --> 00:30:02,600
 - She has a bit 20 of heartaches, I can say that.

392
00:30:02,600 --> 00:30:04,600
 [laughter]

393
00:30:04,600 --> 00:30:07,600
 - Can I say one last thing from these? It's a funny old world.

394
00:30:07,600 --> 00:30:08,600
 - Yeah, yeah.

395
00:30:08,600 --> 00:30:10,600
 - So, they're just such great stories.

396
00:30:10,600 --> 00:30:15,600
 A sexline caller complained to trading standards after dialing an 0891 number

397
00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:19,600
 for an advertisement saying, "Hear me moan only to be played a tape of a woman

398
00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:21,600
 nagging her husband for failing to do jobs around the house."

399
00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:24,600
 [laughter]

400
00:30:24,600 --> 00:30:27,600
 And then a sign seen in a police canteen in Christchurch, New Zealand,

401
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:31,600
 "Will the person who took a slice of cake from the commissioner's office return it immediately.

402
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:33,600
 It is needed as evidence in a poisoning case."

403
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:35,600
 [laughter]

404
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:41,600
 [music]

405
00:30:41,600 --> 00:30:45,600
 Okay, it's time for fact number three, and that is Andy.

406
00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:48,600
 My fact is that despite them being one of the largest fish on the planet,

407
00:30:48,600 --> 00:30:52,600
 nobody knows where female whale sharks live.

408
00:30:52,600 --> 00:30:53,600
 - So, not the ocean.

409
00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:54,600
 - Yes, the ocean.

410
00:30:54,600 --> 00:30:55,600
 - Oh.

411
00:30:55,600 --> 00:30:56,600
 - Yeah, so...

412
00:30:56,600 --> 00:30:57,600
 [laughter]

413
00:30:57,600 --> 00:30:58,600
 - Okay, next fact.

414
00:30:58,600 --> 00:30:59,600
 [laughter]

415
00:30:59,600 --> 00:31:01,600
 - Solve that quickly.

416
00:31:01,600 --> 00:31:02,600
 - Oh, wow.

417
00:31:02,600 --> 00:31:03,600
 - Tell us the creek.

418
00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:04,600
 - Detective Dan investigates.

419
00:31:04,600 --> 00:31:06,600
 - You are welcome.

420
00:31:06,600 --> 00:31:07,600
 - They live in the ocean.

421
00:31:07,600 --> 00:31:08,600
 - It's a big place.

422
00:31:08,600 --> 00:31:09,600
 - It's a big place.

423
00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:12,600
 Just a shout out to Rich Horner, who sent this fact in,

424
00:31:12,600 --> 00:31:14,600
 not knowing that, you know, Dan...

425
00:31:14,600 --> 00:31:15,600
 - Would solve it so quickly.

426
00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:16,600
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

427
00:31:16,600 --> 00:31:19,600
 This is about whale sharks, which are absolutely massive,

428
00:31:19,600 --> 00:31:21,600
 and I don't know very much about them.

429
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:22,600
 They're the largest shark.

430
00:31:22,600 --> 00:31:23,600
 - Yeah.

431
00:31:23,600 --> 00:31:24,600
 - So they're not a whale, they're a shark.

432
00:31:24,600 --> 00:31:25,600
 - Yeah.

433
00:31:25,600 --> 00:31:26,600
 - And they're only called a whale shark,

434
00:31:26,600 --> 00:31:27,600
 because they're just so huge.

435
00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:29,600
 - Largest fish, I reckon.

436
00:31:29,600 --> 00:31:30,600
 He said one of the largest fish,

437
00:31:30,600 --> 00:31:31,600
 but there can't be many bigger.

438
00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:33,600
 - They're a sunfish, aren't they, which are massive.

439
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:34,600
 - Oh, they are.

440
00:31:34,600 --> 00:31:35,600
 - I don't know.

441
00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:36,600
 There are different dimensions, aren't they?

442
00:31:36,600 --> 00:31:37,600
 There's mass, and then there's length,

443
00:31:37,600 --> 00:31:38,600
 and there's all of this.

444
00:31:38,600 --> 00:31:39,600
 But they are absolutely huge.

445
00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:46,600
 - I haven't, like, a year too much at three elephants.

446
00:31:46,600 --> 00:31:47,600
 - Wow.

447
00:31:47,600 --> 00:31:48,600
 - Yeah.

448
00:31:48,600 --> 00:31:49,600
 - And yet we don't know where the females live.

449
00:31:49,600 --> 00:31:50,600
 It's mad.

450
00:31:50,600 --> 00:31:52,600
 So scientists, they know where young males are,

451
00:31:52,600 --> 00:31:54,600
 because they tend to frequent waters

452
00:31:54,600 --> 00:31:56,600
 that are more coastal, and...

453
00:31:56,600 --> 00:31:58,600
 Oh, they're very harmless, by the way, should say.

454
00:31:58,600 --> 00:32:01,600
 They're omnivores, but they eat plankton, and...

455
00:32:01,600 --> 00:32:02,600
 - Not if you're a plankton.

456
00:32:02,600 --> 00:32:04,600
 - Well, that's a good point, yeah.

457
00:32:04,600 --> 00:32:06,600
 And there's one place where scientists know

458
00:32:06,600 --> 00:32:08,600
 they're likely to find female whale sharks,

459
00:32:08,600 --> 00:32:10,600
 which is just off Darwin,

460
00:32:10,600 --> 00:32:12,600
 which is the northernmost Galapagos island.

461
00:32:12,600 --> 00:32:15,600
 But that's the only place that they know they hang out.

462
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:16,600
 - Okay.

463
00:32:16,600 --> 00:32:17,600
 - I mean, they live, you know,

464
00:32:17,600 --> 00:32:18,600
 across thousands of miles of ocean.

465
00:32:18,600 --> 00:32:19,600
 They're just missing.

466
00:32:19,600 --> 00:32:20,600
 - Just evade us.

467
00:32:20,600 --> 00:32:21,600
 - Yeah.

468
00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:25,600
 - I read that they actually found

469
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:31,600
 water-confirmed pregnant whale sharks,

470
00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:36,600
 and it was 10.6 metres.

471
00:32:36,600 --> 00:32:37,600
 - Okay.

472
00:32:37,600 --> 00:32:42,600
 - And she contained 300...

473
00:32:42,600 --> 00:32:43,600
 - What?

474
00:32:43,600 --> 00:32:44,600
 - What?

475
00:32:44,600 --> 00:32:45,600
 - ...300?

476
00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:46,600
 - Yeah.

477
00:32:46,600 --> 00:32:47,600
 - Holy moly.

478
00:32:47,600 --> 00:32:50,600
 - But they don't all shark bite.

479
00:32:50,600 --> 00:32:51,600
 - Well, thank...

480
00:32:51,600 --> 00:32:52,600
 I mean, thank goodness.

481
00:32:52,600 --> 00:32:53,600
 In a sense.

482
00:32:53,600 --> 00:32:54,600
 We know exactly where they all work,

483
00:32:54,600 --> 00:32:55,600
 because it would be knee-deep.

484
00:32:55,600 --> 00:32:57,600
 It would be like Bridlington and...

485
00:32:57,600 --> 00:32:58,600
 - Oh, god.

486
00:32:58,600 --> 00:32:59,600
 - Fish and shape shops.

487
00:32:59,600 --> 00:33:00,600
 - Yeah.

488
00:33:00,600 --> 00:33:01,600
 - Wow.

489
00:33:01,600 --> 00:33:04,600
 - Yeah, and they give birth...

490
00:33:04,600 --> 00:33:06,600
 They're called Aplacentally Viviparis.

491
00:33:06,600 --> 00:33:09,600
 So, other parruses where you lay an egg,

492
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:11,600
 Viviparis is live young,

493
00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:16,600
 but Aplacental Viviparis is where you lay an egg inside yourself.

494
00:33:16,600 --> 00:33:18,600
 It then hatches also inside you,

495
00:33:18,600 --> 00:33:20,600
 and then you eventually give birth to the live young,

496
00:33:20,600 --> 00:33:21,600
 which is actually...

497
00:33:21,600 --> 00:33:24,600
 So, 300 eggs will have hatched inside that mother.

498
00:33:24,600 --> 00:33:26,600
 - Those eggs are the biggest eggs on Earth as well.

499
00:33:26,600 --> 00:33:27,600
 - Are they?

500
00:33:27,600 --> 00:33:28,600
 - Yeah.

501
00:33:28,600 --> 00:33:30,600
 - I didn't realise that...

502
00:33:30,600 --> 00:33:32,600
 This might be common knowledge,

503
00:33:32,600 --> 00:33:33,600
 but what makes...

504
00:33:33,600 --> 00:33:35,600
 This is a whale shark.

505
00:33:35,600 --> 00:33:36,600
 What makes it more shark than whale?

506
00:33:36,600 --> 00:33:38,600
 What's the difference between a whale and a shark?

507
00:33:38,600 --> 00:33:40,600
 - One's a mammal and one's a fish.

508
00:33:40,600 --> 00:33:41,600
 - Yeah, but one other difference,

509
00:33:41,600 --> 00:33:42,600
 which I didn't know,

510
00:33:42,600 --> 00:33:44,600
 is that sharks are all cartilage,

511
00:33:44,600 --> 00:33:45,600
 and whales are bone.

512
00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:46,600
 - Oh, right, yeah.

513
00:33:46,600 --> 00:33:47,600
 - That's what makes it the shark.

514
00:33:47,600 --> 00:33:48,600
 - That's true.

515
00:33:48,600 --> 00:33:49,600
 - Is that crazy?

516
00:33:49,600 --> 00:33:50,600
 No bones?

517
00:33:50,600 --> 00:33:53,600
 - One interesting thing because of that is that,

518
00:33:53,600 --> 00:33:56,600
 you know how or I know this because I'm old?

519
00:33:56,600 --> 00:33:57,600
 As you get older as a human,

520
00:33:57,600 --> 00:33:58,600
 you kind of get stiffer.

521
00:33:58,600 --> 00:33:59,600
 - Yeah.

522
00:33:59,600 --> 00:34:00,600
 - A lot.

523
00:34:00,600 --> 00:34:02,600
 Well, sharks are the opposite.

524
00:34:02,600 --> 00:34:04,600
 Sharks start off being quite stiff,

525
00:34:04,600 --> 00:34:05,600
 and then as they get older,

526
00:34:05,600 --> 00:34:07,600
 they get fluffier and fluffier.

527
00:34:07,600 --> 00:34:08,600
 - Yeah, that's funny.

528
00:34:08,600 --> 00:34:09,600
 - Maybe.

529
00:34:09,600 --> 00:34:14,600
 Maybe I haven't got cerebral palsy.

530
00:34:14,600 --> 00:34:17,600
 Maybe I'm a shark.

531
00:34:17,600 --> 00:34:20,600
 - If you've got more than 300 teeth,

532
00:34:20,600 --> 00:34:21,600
 that is another sign.

533
00:34:21,600 --> 00:34:22,600
 - Oh, no.

534
00:34:22,600 --> 00:34:25,600
 I've only got 200.

535
00:34:29,600 --> 00:34:37,600
 - Speaking of teeth, whales have teeth on their eyes.

536
00:34:37,600 --> 00:34:38,600
 - Oh, yeah?

537
00:34:38,600 --> 00:34:39,600
 - Yeah.

538
00:34:39,600 --> 00:34:40,600
 - What are they called?

539
00:34:40,600 --> 00:34:41,600
 Denticles or something like this?

540
00:34:41,600 --> 00:34:42,600
 - Yeah.

541
00:34:42,600 --> 00:34:45,600
 - Because sharks don't have eyelids.

542
00:34:45,600 --> 00:34:50,600
 So in order to protect them,

543
00:34:50,600 --> 00:34:54,600
 they have what looks like little teeth.

544
00:34:54,600 --> 00:34:55,600
 - Yeah.

545
00:34:55,600 --> 00:34:56,600
 - That's amazing.

546
00:34:56,600 --> 00:34:58,600
 - And their eyes stick out a tiny bit from their head,

547
00:34:58,600 --> 00:35:00,600
 which is also a problem, obviously,

548
00:35:00,600 --> 00:35:01,600
 in terms of protecting them.

549
00:35:01,600 --> 00:35:02,600
 - Yeah.

550
00:35:02,600 --> 00:35:03,600
 - So they have another trick,

551
00:35:03,600 --> 00:35:04,600
 which is that they can retract their eyes.

552
00:35:04,600 --> 00:35:05,600
 - Oh, really?

553
00:35:05,600 --> 00:35:06,600
 - They just go, boop.

554
00:35:06,600 --> 00:35:08,600
 - When what?

555
00:35:08,600 --> 00:35:09,600
 - I guess when danger threatens.

556
00:35:09,600 --> 00:35:10,600
 It's quite a long way.

557
00:35:10,600 --> 00:35:12,600
 It's about half the diameter of the eyeball.

558
00:35:12,600 --> 00:35:13,600
 They can just--

559
00:35:13,600 --> 00:35:14,600
 - Wow.

560
00:35:14,600 --> 00:35:17,600
 I love the ugly noises for whenever animals do anything at all.

561
00:35:17,600 --> 00:35:20,600
 - I remember when hippos retracted their testicles

562
00:35:20,600 --> 00:35:21,600
 by going, boop.

563
00:35:21,600 --> 00:35:22,600
 - Exactly.

564
00:35:22,600 --> 00:35:23,600
 The teeth as well.

565
00:35:23,600 --> 00:35:25,600
 So these teeth that are all over their eyes

566
00:35:25,600 --> 00:35:26,600
 are all over their body as well.

567
00:35:26,600 --> 00:35:28,600
 They've got these denticles all over their body.

568
00:35:28,600 --> 00:35:30,600
 And I've read this description saying that

569
00:35:30,600 --> 00:35:31,600
 it's a protection thing.

570
00:35:31,600 --> 00:35:33,600
 So if another shark bites them back,

571
00:35:33,600 --> 00:35:35,600
 without them really doing anything,

572
00:35:35,600 --> 00:35:37,600
 they're sort of biting the shark back itself,

573
00:35:37,600 --> 00:35:40,600
 because the teeth might hurt a bit, I guess,

574
00:35:40,600 --> 00:35:41,600
 if you're biting into it.

575
00:35:41,600 --> 00:35:42,600
 - Oh, right.

576
00:35:42,600 --> 00:35:43,600
 - That's just mad.

577
00:35:43,600 --> 00:35:44,600
 - Yeah, crazy.

578
00:35:44,600 --> 00:35:47,600
 - They're biting something from your torso.

579
00:35:47,600 --> 00:35:49,600
 - It's nuts.

580
00:35:49,600 --> 00:35:51,600
 They grow really quickly.

581
00:35:51,600 --> 00:35:52,600
 So they're born quite big,

582
00:35:52,600 --> 00:35:54,600
 but then they get really big.

583
00:35:54,600 --> 00:35:56,600
 So there was one in an aquarium

584
00:35:56,600 --> 00:35:59,600
 that went from weighing 1.7 pounds

585
00:35:59,600 --> 00:36:04,600
 to 333.4 pounds in three years,

586
00:36:04,600 --> 00:36:05,600
 just over three years.

587
00:36:05,600 --> 00:36:07,600
 And I worked out in human terms,

588
00:36:07,600 --> 00:36:10,600
 that would be equivalent of a three-year-old baby

589
00:36:10,600 --> 00:36:13,600
 growing to the size of the world's largest unicycle.

590
00:36:13,600 --> 00:36:17,600
 - You always go too far with these things.

591
00:36:17,600 --> 00:36:18,600
 You always think,

592
00:36:18,600 --> 00:36:20,600
 "I can cram in one more fact here."

593
00:36:20,600 --> 00:36:22,600
 - You can imagine that with the world figures.

594
00:36:22,600 --> 00:36:23,600
 - Well, I can imagine a range of things

595
00:36:23,600 --> 00:36:24,600
 with the world's biggest unicycle,

596
00:36:24,600 --> 00:36:26,600
 because right now I'm imagining the Empire State Building

597
00:36:26,600 --> 00:36:28,600
 with a unicycle leaning up against the entire night of it.

598
00:36:28,600 --> 00:36:29,600
 - Oh, no, it's smaller than that.

599
00:36:29,600 --> 00:36:30,600
 - How big is the world's biggest unicycle?

600
00:36:30,600 --> 00:36:31,600
 - It's 31 feet.

601
00:36:31,600 --> 00:36:32,600
 - Oh, that's big.

602
00:36:32,600 --> 00:36:34,600
 - I thought everyone knew that, actually.

603
00:36:34,600 --> 00:36:35,600
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

604
00:36:35,600 --> 00:36:36,600
 - 31 feet.

605
00:36:36,600 --> 00:36:37,600
 - As in 31 feet,

606
00:36:37,600 --> 00:36:41,600
 but in the same proportions as a normal human.

607
00:36:41,600 --> 00:36:45,600
 - So the child wouldn't look like a unicycle,

608
00:36:45,600 --> 00:36:46,600
 is what you're saying?

609
00:36:46,600 --> 00:36:49,600
 - No, it would look like a normal proportioned human,

610
00:36:49,600 --> 00:36:50,600
 but 31 feet tall.

611
00:36:50,600 --> 00:36:51,600
 - Yeah.

612
00:36:51,600 --> 00:36:52,600
 - Oh, my God.

613
00:36:52,600 --> 00:36:54,600
 - I think the unicycle thing is really thrown.

614
00:36:54,600 --> 00:36:57,600
 (all laughing)

615
00:36:57,600 --> 00:36:58,600
 - I've got more questions about the unicycle now.

616
00:36:58,600 --> 00:36:59,600
 Is it rideable, this unicycle?

617
00:36:59,600 --> 00:37:00,600
 - Yeah, it has to be rideable,

618
00:37:00,600 --> 00:37:02,600
 otherwise it doesn't get the world record.

619
00:37:02,600 --> 00:37:03,600
 - Yeah.

620
00:37:03,600 --> 00:37:05,600
 - God, that must be a terrifying unicycle ride.

621
00:37:05,600 --> 00:37:06,600
 - Yeah.

622
00:37:06,600 --> 00:37:07,600
 - How long must your legs be to ride that?

623
00:37:07,600 --> 00:37:08,600
 - Yeah.

624
00:37:08,600 --> 00:37:10,600
 - I think what they do is they keep the pedals

625
00:37:10,600 --> 00:37:12,600
 quite close to where your bum is,

626
00:37:12,600 --> 00:37:14,600
 like the same distance as your leg.

627
00:37:14,600 --> 00:37:16,600
 - I wouldn't have done it that way,

628
00:37:16,600 --> 00:37:18,600
 but I think they've done it better, actually.

629
00:37:18,600 --> 00:37:21,600
 (all laughing)

630
00:37:21,600 --> 00:37:23,600
 - That was a big wheel.

631
00:37:23,600 --> 00:37:27,600
 - No, it's mostly like a long stalk.

632
00:37:27,600 --> 00:37:28,600
 - It's mostly the pole, yeah.

633
00:37:28,600 --> 00:37:30,600
 - It's really, it's a normal unicycle,

634
00:37:30,600 --> 00:37:32,600
 but they've just extended the distance

635
00:37:32,600 --> 00:37:34,600
 between the wheel and the pedals.

636
00:37:34,600 --> 00:37:36,600
 - I've seen people do it on these record size.

637
00:37:36,600 --> 00:37:37,600
 It's petrified.

638
00:37:37,600 --> 00:37:39,600
 - Well, you would be able to know exactly

639
00:37:39,600 --> 00:37:41,600
 how big one of these babies that don't exist would be,

640
00:37:41,600 --> 00:37:43,600
 because you've seen it yourself.

641
00:37:43,600 --> 00:37:44,600
 - Yes, exactly.

642
00:37:44,600 --> 00:37:45,600
 So I was on board.

643
00:37:45,600 --> 00:37:48,600
 - I thought it was a fantastic analogy.

644
00:37:48,600 --> 00:37:50,600
 You need to watch more YouTube clips, you too.

645
00:37:50,600 --> 00:37:53,600
 (all laughing)

646
00:37:53,600 --> 00:37:55,600
 - These pups, we were talking about a bit earlier.

647
00:37:55,600 --> 00:37:56,600
 - Yeah.

648
00:37:56,600 --> 00:37:59,600
 - So those 300 pups, this is a really cool thing.

649
00:37:59,600 --> 00:38:01,600
 They're often, inside the mother,

650
00:38:01,600 --> 00:38:03,600
 there are different stages of development,

651
00:38:03,600 --> 00:38:06,600
 but they're all from the same father, Whale Shark.

652
00:38:06,600 --> 00:38:09,600
 The mother can basically stall sperm for ages

653
00:38:09,600 --> 00:38:13,600
 and gradually fertilize a little bit at a time.

654
00:38:13,600 --> 00:38:14,600
 - Oh, yeah.

655
00:38:14,600 --> 00:38:15,600
 - Yeah, you know.

656
00:38:15,600 --> 00:38:17,600
 - Yeah, so I think other sharks do it,

657
00:38:17,600 --> 00:38:18,600
 and maybe even kangaroos,

658
00:38:18,600 --> 00:38:21,600
 where they sort of like pocket away the sperm.

659
00:38:21,600 --> 00:38:23,600
 - That's not what's in that pocket, is it?

660
00:38:23,600 --> 00:38:25,600
 (all laughing)

661
00:38:25,600 --> 00:38:26,600
 It's full of sperm.

662
00:38:26,600 --> 00:38:28,600
 (all laughing)

663
00:38:28,600 --> 00:38:29,600
 - Wow, really, is that right?

664
00:38:29,600 --> 00:38:31,600
 - So it's one, just to get this right,

665
00:38:31,600 --> 00:38:35,600
 it's one male Whale Shark, has sex,

666
00:38:35,600 --> 00:38:37,600
 the female keeps all the sperm,

667
00:38:37,600 --> 00:38:40,600
 and then slowly has more and more children.

668
00:38:40,600 --> 00:38:41,600
 - Exactly, exactly.

669
00:38:41,600 --> 00:38:43,600
 I think it's one mating session.

670
00:38:43,600 --> 00:38:44,600
 - And then...

671
00:38:44,600 --> 00:38:49,600
 - Imagine if humans could do that.

672
00:38:49,600 --> 00:38:54,600
 Show me you had sex for 20 years already.

673
00:38:54,600 --> 00:38:55,600
 - Yeah.

674
00:38:55,600 --> 00:38:59,600
 - Coming round with a baby.

675
00:38:59,600 --> 00:39:01,600
 - Yeah, when you finally get the call

676
00:39:01,600 --> 00:39:02,600
 that you've got an illegitimate child,

677
00:39:02,600 --> 00:39:05,600
 it's like, you've got 20 illegitimate kids.

678
00:39:05,600 --> 00:39:06,600
 - Yeah.

679
00:39:06,600 --> 00:39:08,600
 - And they're the size of the world's largest uter cycle.

680
00:39:08,600 --> 00:39:09,600
 - Yeah.

681
00:39:09,600 --> 00:39:10,600
 - And that drunken night in Biddlington,

682
00:39:10,600 --> 00:39:11,600
 well, you're a...

683
00:39:11,600 --> 00:39:18,600
 - 118, 112, 108.

684
00:39:18,600 --> 00:39:19,600
 - Yeah.

685
00:39:19,600 --> 00:39:21,600
 - They have this really interesting habit,

686
00:39:21,600 --> 00:39:22,600
 Whale Sharks, which is,

687
00:39:22,600 --> 00:39:24,600
 they dive down about 2,000 meters.

688
00:39:24,600 --> 00:39:25,600
 - Yeah.

689
00:39:25,600 --> 00:39:27,600
 - Huge, it's the largest vertical range,

690
00:39:27,600 --> 00:39:29,600
 almost, of any sea creature.

691
00:39:29,600 --> 00:39:33,600
 - Oh, that's like 200 times the size of the world's largest uter cycle.

692
00:39:33,600 --> 00:39:34,600
 - Oh my gosh.

693
00:39:34,600 --> 00:39:35,600
 (all laughing)

694
00:39:35,600 --> 00:39:38,600
 - Yeah, well, that really makes you think, doesn't it?

695
00:39:38,600 --> 00:39:39,600
 Imagine that.

696
00:39:39,600 --> 00:39:42,600
 - How long would your legs have to be taking that?

697
00:39:42,600 --> 00:39:43,600
 - Okay, so...

698
00:39:43,600 --> 00:39:45,600
 - And the thing is, we don't know why.

699
00:39:45,600 --> 00:39:47,600
 And also, when they sink,

700
00:39:47,600 --> 00:39:50,600
 so scientists often tag the few that they can find to research,

701
00:39:50,600 --> 00:39:52,600
 because that's a really useful thing for them,

702
00:39:52,600 --> 00:39:55,600
 but it shakes, basically, the tags don't work 2,000 meters down.

703
00:39:55,600 --> 00:39:56,600
 - Oh, really?

704
00:39:56,600 --> 00:39:58,600
 - So they can see in the dark as a result.

705
00:39:58,600 --> 00:39:59,600
 They've got special genetic mutation,

706
00:39:59,600 --> 00:40:00,600
 which allows them to see in the dark,

707
00:40:00,600 --> 00:40:01,600
 because they are so deep down.

708
00:40:01,600 --> 00:40:02,600
 - Wow.

709
00:40:02,600 --> 00:40:03,600
 - But there is a...

710
00:40:03,600 --> 00:40:04,600
 And we don't know why they do it,

711
00:40:04,600 --> 00:40:06,600
 because down there, there's less oxygen,

712
00:40:06,600 --> 00:40:08,600
 there's less food, it's very cold,

713
00:40:08,600 --> 00:40:11,600
 so they have to warm themselves up a bit afterwards.

714
00:40:11,600 --> 00:40:13,600
 There is one theory.

715
00:40:13,600 --> 00:40:14,600
 Well, there are a couple of theories, I think,

716
00:40:14,600 --> 00:40:18,600
 but this is from a whale shark scientist called Simon Pierce,

717
00:40:18,600 --> 00:40:21,600
 which is that it might be so they can navigate better,

718
00:40:21,600 --> 00:40:24,600
 because they can get a better reading of the Earth's magnetic field

719
00:40:24,600 --> 00:40:26,600
 closer to the crust.

720
00:40:26,600 --> 00:40:27,600
 - Oh, wow.

721
00:40:27,600 --> 00:40:30,600
 - Which is effectively that they're going to get a better signal.

722
00:40:30,600 --> 00:40:33,600
 - That's amazing, which I love as a theory.

723
00:40:33,600 --> 00:40:36,600
 - It's like holding your phone up in the Earth to get a better signal.

724
00:40:36,600 --> 00:40:37,600
 - Yeah, it's exactly like that.

725
00:40:37,600 --> 00:40:39,600
 - Wow, that's super.

726
00:40:39,600 --> 00:40:40,600
 - Yeah.

727
00:40:40,600 --> 00:40:41,600
 - It's incredible.

728
00:40:41,600 --> 00:40:45,600
 We don't know if they make noises as in vocalizations.

729
00:40:45,600 --> 00:40:46,600
 - Oh, really?

730
00:40:46,600 --> 00:40:48,600
 - Well, we kind of know that they don't,

731
00:40:48,600 --> 00:40:51,600
 but there's a few scientists that think that they do.

732
00:40:51,600 --> 00:40:52,600
 - Okay.

733
00:40:52,600 --> 00:40:53,600
 - And it's very confusing,

734
00:40:53,600 --> 00:40:55,600
 because they don't, as far as we can tell,

735
00:40:55,600 --> 00:40:57,600
 have anything that would make a sound.

736
00:40:57,600 --> 00:40:59,600
 No vocal cords whatsoever.

737
00:40:59,600 --> 00:41:00,600
 The way that their teeth are set up

738
00:41:00,600 --> 00:41:02,600
 is they can't do a grinding sound

739
00:41:02,600 --> 00:41:04,600
 to create a noise that comes out as grinding.

740
00:41:04,600 --> 00:41:06,600
 So they don't have a swim bladder,

741
00:41:06,600 --> 00:41:10,600
 which a lot of fish will use to control buoyancy,

742
00:41:10,600 --> 00:41:12,600
 but also noise will come out of that that you'll hear.

743
00:41:12,600 --> 00:41:16,600
 So you don't have anywhere really that sound can come from.

744
00:41:16,600 --> 00:41:18,600
 Yet there is a scientist called Heather Barrett

745
00:41:18,600 --> 00:41:20,600
 who has been recording them,

746
00:41:20,600 --> 00:41:22,600
 and a couple of times has got sound out of them.

747
00:41:22,600 --> 00:41:24,600
 So it's a sort of mysterious thing.

748
00:41:24,600 --> 00:41:26,600
 She's been following this one male called Shredder.

749
00:41:26,600 --> 00:41:28,600
 She said she thought it sounded like two strokes

750
00:41:28,600 --> 00:41:31,600
 over the ridged back of those wooden frog noisemakers,

751
00:41:31,600 --> 00:41:33,600
 salted tourists in every Mexican market.

752
00:41:33,600 --> 00:41:37,600
 Another relatable example.

753
00:41:37,600 --> 00:41:38,600
 - Oh my God.

754
00:41:38,600 --> 00:41:41,600
 - But yeah, so big mystery to be solved.

755
00:41:41,600 --> 00:41:42,600
 - Wow.

756
00:41:42,600 --> 00:41:43,600
 - Do the whale sharks make noises.

757
00:41:43,600 --> 00:41:44,600
 - Very cool.

758
00:41:44,600 --> 00:41:45,600
 - Yeah.

759
00:41:45,600 --> 00:41:47,600
 - I was looking at some odd females in the animal kingdom.

760
00:41:47,600 --> 00:41:48,600
 - Oh yeah.

761
00:41:48,600 --> 00:41:51,600
 - Because I found that there's a thing called a pouched rat,

762
00:41:51,600 --> 00:41:55,600
 and some female pouched rats can create a chemical

763
00:41:55,600 --> 00:41:58,600
 that makes all the other females vaginas seal up.

764
00:41:58,600 --> 00:42:01,600
 (all laughing)

765
00:42:01,600 --> 00:42:02,600
 - Wow.

766
00:42:02,600 --> 00:42:04,600
 - Isn't that amazing?

767
00:42:04,600 --> 00:42:05,600
 - Wow.

768
00:42:05,600 --> 00:42:08,600
 So is it a status?

769
00:42:08,600 --> 00:42:09,600
 - Yeah.

770
00:42:09,600 --> 00:42:11,600
 - Do you have to be the sort of lead?

771
00:42:11,600 --> 00:42:12,600
 - You're a spot on.

772
00:42:12,600 --> 00:42:15,600
 So like the most dominant female in a pack of pouched rats,

773
00:42:15,600 --> 00:42:17,600
 she'll be the one who's mating,

774
00:42:17,600 --> 00:42:19,600
 and to stop any of the other females mating,

775
00:42:19,600 --> 00:42:21,600
 she sends out this chemical,

776
00:42:21,600 --> 00:42:23,600
 and all the vaginas go, "Rick!"

777
00:42:23,600 --> 00:42:24,600
 (all laughing)

778
00:42:24,600 --> 00:42:25,600
 - And close up.

779
00:42:25,600 --> 00:42:27,600
 - You put it in terms I can understand now.

780
00:42:27,600 --> 00:42:28,600
 (all laughing)

781
00:42:28,600 --> 00:42:30,600
 - Isn't that amazing?

782
00:42:30,600 --> 00:42:31,600
 I find that astonishing.

783
00:42:31,600 --> 00:42:33,600
 - What a power move.

784
00:42:33,600 --> 00:42:36,600
 (all laughing)

785
00:42:36,600 --> 00:42:37,600
 - That's the craziest thing.

786
00:42:37,600 --> 00:42:39,600
 That's one of all the years.

787
00:42:39,600 --> 00:42:42,600
 That's one of the weirdest facts I think I've ever had on this show.

788
00:42:42,600 --> 00:42:44,600
 - You should write Funny Old World for the Guardian.

789
00:42:44,600 --> 00:42:46,600
 (all laughing)

790
00:42:46,600 --> 00:42:51,600
 (upbeat music)

791
00:42:51,600 --> 00:42:54,600
 - Okay, it is time for our final fact of the show,

792
00:42:54,600 --> 00:42:55,600
 and that is James.

793
00:42:55,600 --> 00:43:00,600
 - Okay, my fact this week is that the place where Judas plotted to betray Jesus

794
00:43:00,600 --> 00:43:03,600
 is about to become a ziplining site.

795
00:43:03,600 --> 00:43:04,600
 (all laughing)

796
00:43:04,600 --> 00:43:05,600
 - So cool.

797
00:43:05,600 --> 00:43:08,600
 Will they mark on the ground the point where Judas did the exact plotting

798
00:43:08,600 --> 00:43:11,600
 so that as you zipline over it, you can contemplate that?

799
00:43:11,600 --> 00:43:12,600
 - That would be good.

800
00:43:12,600 --> 00:43:16,600
 Or maybe you have to pay 30 pieces of silver or anything else to do it.

801
00:43:16,600 --> 00:43:17,600
 I don't know.

802
00:43:17,600 --> 00:43:19,600
 This is in Jerusalem,

803
00:43:19,600 --> 00:43:24,600
 and it's an area sometimes known as the Hill of Evil Council.

804
00:43:24,600 --> 00:43:28,600
 And according to tradition, this is where Judas plotted to betray Jesus.

805
00:43:28,600 --> 00:43:34,600
 And it's part of a more general sort of attempt in Jerusalem

806
00:43:34,600 --> 00:43:38,600
 to bring more tourists in and make it more tourist friendly.

807
00:43:38,600 --> 00:43:43,600
 Although some people say it as part of a bigger political strategy

808
00:43:43,600 --> 00:43:47,600
 to make East and West Jerusalem less solid things

809
00:43:47,600 --> 00:43:51,600
 and maybe make Jerusalem a more Israeli area.

810
00:43:51,600 --> 00:43:54,600
 - What does ziplines do? They cross borders.

811
00:43:54,600 --> 00:43:57,600
 Normally a good thing, but sometimes it can be controversial.

812
00:43:57,600 --> 00:43:58,600
 - It can be controversial.

813
00:43:58,600 --> 00:44:00,600
 And according to some people, in this case it is.

814
00:44:00,600 --> 00:44:01,600
 - Can I check?

815
00:44:01,600 --> 00:44:02,600
 Sorry, James.

816
00:44:02,600 --> 00:44:04,600
 What you said, the place where Judas plotted to betray Jesus,

817
00:44:04,600 --> 00:44:08,600
 I thought, well, maybe this is the place where Judas actually betrayed Jesus.

818
00:44:08,600 --> 00:44:09,600
 - The Garden of Gethsemane.

819
00:44:09,600 --> 00:44:10,600
 - Garden of Gethsemane.

820
00:44:10,600 --> 00:44:11,600
 - Yeah, that's where he did the actual betrayal.

821
00:44:11,600 --> 00:44:13,600
 - So this is just like the pre-betrayal--

822
00:44:13,600 --> 00:44:15,600
 - This is where he thought about it.

823
00:44:15,600 --> 00:44:19,600
 He was like, you know, you can't just turn up at the Garden of Gethsemane with no plan.

824
00:44:19,600 --> 00:44:21,600
 You need to think about it first.

825
00:44:21,600 --> 00:44:25,600
 - If you fail to prepare to betray Jesus, you prepare to fail.

826
00:44:25,600 --> 00:44:27,600
 - Yeah, and this was in the Hill of Evil Council.

827
00:44:27,600 --> 00:44:31,600
 So it was where, I think it was where the Romans sort of came up to him

828
00:44:31,600 --> 00:44:34,600
 and said, hey, want to do a bit of betraying?

829
00:44:34,600 --> 00:44:35,600
 - Wow.

830
00:44:35,600 --> 00:44:38,600
 - And yeah, that was where that supposedly happened.

831
00:44:38,600 --> 00:44:41,600
 - At the end of that meeting, Judas went, God, I wonder one day in the future,

832
00:44:41,600 --> 00:44:43,600
 how they're going to commemorate this spot.

833
00:44:43,600 --> 00:44:46,600
 A statue of me, what's it going to be?

834
00:44:46,600 --> 00:44:49,600
 - And then, yeah, you can get on your zipline

835
00:44:49,600 --> 00:44:52,600
 and it'll take you down to a place called the Peace Forest.

836
00:44:52,600 --> 00:44:54,600
 - Oh, lovely.

837
00:44:54,600 --> 00:44:58,600
 - It doesn't have any biblical story attached to it.

838
00:44:58,600 --> 00:45:01,600
 But then the developers are saying, well, it's nothing to do with this political thing.

839
00:45:01,600 --> 00:45:04,600
 It's actually because they're quite neglected areas.

840
00:45:04,600 --> 00:45:07,600
 A lot of drug dealers around there.

841
00:45:07,600 --> 00:45:11,600
 - So how do you fight drug dealing with ziplines?

842
00:45:11,600 --> 00:45:12,600
 Yeah, yeah.

843
00:45:12,600 --> 00:45:14,600
 Make it easier to escape, yeah.

844
00:45:14,600 --> 00:45:18,600
 - Yeah, you can do the job.

845
00:45:18,600 --> 00:45:21,600
 - Put a ziplock on a zipline.

846
00:45:21,600 --> 00:45:25,600
 - It's very hard to drop a single E into someone's mouth from a zipline, though.

847
00:45:25,600 --> 00:45:26,600
 That is a...

848
00:45:26,600 --> 00:45:30,600
 - I smell a challenge.

849
00:45:30,600 --> 00:45:32,600
 - I've never been on a zipline.

850
00:45:32,600 --> 00:45:33,600
 - I have.

851
00:45:33,600 --> 00:45:34,600
 - Have you?

852
00:45:34,600 --> 00:45:40,600
 - Oh, yes, I went to the channel for travel show.

853
00:45:40,600 --> 00:45:50,600
 But in hindsight, I think the producers were trying to kill me.

854
00:45:50,600 --> 00:45:58,600
 Because every day I go in the office and be like,

855
00:45:58,600 --> 00:46:00,600
 "Okay, turn that off.

856
00:46:00,600 --> 00:46:04,600
 You're going to skydive."

857
00:46:04,600 --> 00:46:08,600
 - Whoa, were the producers related to anyone you'd slagged off at the Paralympics?

858
00:46:08,600 --> 00:46:09,600
 The previous, yeah.

859
00:46:09,600 --> 00:46:10,600
 Was that okay?

860
00:46:10,600 --> 00:46:12,600
 - They all had an E, didn't they?

861
00:46:12,600 --> 00:46:13,600
 And they were...

862
00:46:13,600 --> 00:46:20,600
 - Look, so we did one episode in Wales,

863
00:46:20,600 --> 00:46:28,600
 which is home to the longest and fastest zipline,

864
00:46:28,600 --> 00:46:33,600
 and it was incredible.

865
00:46:33,600 --> 00:46:35,600
 - That one looks amazing.

866
00:46:35,600 --> 00:46:36,600
 I've seen clips of that.

867
00:46:36,600 --> 00:46:37,600
 It doesn't look very cool.

868
00:46:37,600 --> 00:46:38,600
 - Jenny Eclair, was it?

869
00:46:38,600 --> 00:46:39,600
 - Yeah.

870
00:46:39,600 --> 00:46:40,600
 - Yeah.

871
00:46:40,600 --> 00:46:41,600
 - How do you know?

872
00:46:41,600 --> 00:46:42,600
 - It was on television.

873
00:46:42,600 --> 00:46:50,600
 - I thought I just did it for fun.

874
00:46:50,600 --> 00:46:58,600
 But Jenny was hilarious because obviously,

875
00:46:58,600 --> 00:47:09,600
 I was screaming and yelling and having the time of my life.

876
00:47:09,600 --> 00:47:14,600
 When I looked back at Jenny's video,

877
00:47:14,600 --> 00:47:19,600
 and we were like, "Is she asleep?"

878
00:47:19,600 --> 00:47:23,600
 Like, she was so zen.

879
00:47:23,600 --> 00:47:24,600
 - Oh, really?

880
00:47:24,600 --> 00:47:27,600
 - Like, she said she enjoyed it.

881
00:47:27,600 --> 00:47:28,600
 - Oh, you did?

882
00:47:28,600 --> 00:47:30,600
 - I've been on a zipline only once,

883
00:47:30,600 --> 00:47:31,600
 and it was a tiny one.

884
00:47:31,600 --> 00:47:34,600
 It was one of those adventure places that you go to.

885
00:47:34,600 --> 00:47:37,600
 And I don't know what went wrong.

886
00:47:37,600 --> 00:47:40,600
 I don't know how I'd done my harness up incorrectly.

887
00:47:40,600 --> 00:47:45,600
 It sort of trapped my testicles in a really painful way.

888
00:47:45,600 --> 00:47:48,600
 So I go down the zipline screaming,

889
00:47:48,600 --> 00:47:50,600
 and I don't make it right to the end,

890
00:47:50,600 --> 00:47:52,600
 so I can't get my legs onto the thing.

891
00:47:52,600 --> 00:47:54,600
 And I am screaming like it's really hurting.

892
00:47:54,600 --> 00:47:56,600
 But unfortunately, the person I did it with

893
00:47:56,600 --> 00:47:58,600
 was my friend who's a comedian, Tom Davis,

894
00:47:58,600 --> 00:48:01,600
 who's a very sinister sense of humour,

895
00:48:01,600 --> 00:48:03,600
 and got everyone to step back

896
00:48:03,600 --> 00:48:06,600
 and let me just hang there while I was screaming.

897
00:48:06,600 --> 00:48:08,600
 There's a lot of photos that Tom has online

898
00:48:08,600 --> 00:48:12,600
 of me screaming with my testicles trapped in a...

899
00:48:12,600 --> 00:48:14,600
 Yeah, that's my only experience.

900
00:48:14,600 --> 00:48:15,600
 - Awful.

901
00:48:15,600 --> 00:48:16,600
 And you were sort of...

902
00:48:16,600 --> 00:48:20,600
 You were hanging there, ironically, like a testicle.

903
00:48:20,600 --> 00:48:22,600
 Like a huge testicle.

904
00:48:22,600 --> 00:48:25,600
 But your own testicles weren't free.

905
00:48:25,600 --> 00:48:26,600
 - That was the problem.

906
00:48:26,600 --> 00:48:27,600
 Makes you think, doesn't it?

907
00:48:27,600 --> 00:48:28,600
 - Let's make you think.

908
00:48:28,600 --> 00:48:29,600
 - James, have you been on a zipline?

909
00:48:29,600 --> 00:48:30,600
 - I have.

910
00:48:30,600 --> 00:48:31,600
 I was just thinking...

911
00:48:31,600 --> 00:48:33,600
 I've always liked Tom Davis.

912
00:48:33,600 --> 00:48:35,600
 I like him even more.

913
00:48:35,600 --> 00:48:38,600
 Yeah, now I have a few occasions.

914
00:48:38,600 --> 00:48:40,600
 - Well, the only ones that have been on a zipline.

915
00:48:40,600 --> 00:48:41,600
 - Around this table.

916
00:48:41,600 --> 00:48:45,600
 - Right, come on, we'll all go to work.

917
00:48:45,600 --> 00:48:51,600
 We'll all go change your name by the code.

918
00:48:51,600 --> 00:48:54,600
 We'll go zipline.

919
00:48:54,600 --> 00:48:58,600
 - I've been somewhere that has recently got permission for a zipline.

920
00:48:58,600 --> 00:48:59,600
 - Have you?

921
00:48:59,600 --> 00:49:03,600
 - But when I went there, they hadn't got the planning permission yet.

922
00:49:03,600 --> 00:49:05,600
 Honest to Slate Mine and the Lake District.

923
00:49:05,600 --> 00:49:07,600
 Just wanted to give a shout out to them.

924
00:49:07,600 --> 00:49:09,600
 They spent 10 years trying to get permission for a zipline.

925
00:49:09,600 --> 00:49:10,600
 10 years.

926
00:49:10,600 --> 00:49:11,600
 - Really?

927
00:49:11,600 --> 00:49:14,600
 - The council said, "No, this is beautiful here.

928
00:49:14,600 --> 00:49:15,600
 This old Slate Mine."

929
00:49:15,600 --> 00:49:19,600
 And I've got to tell you, it's not the place that would suffer irretrievable.

930
00:49:19,600 --> 00:49:20,600
 - Watch out, he's slating it.

931
00:49:20,600 --> 00:49:22,600
 - Oh, I enjoyed it.

932
00:49:22,600 --> 00:49:23,600
 I bought some souvenir Slate there.

933
00:49:23,600 --> 00:49:24,600
 I had a really good time.

934
00:49:24,600 --> 00:49:26,600
 It's a fun place to get.

935
00:49:26,600 --> 00:49:29,600
 I was there by myself and I had a really nice time to Slate Mine Walk.

936
00:49:29,600 --> 00:49:30,600
 It was brill.

937
00:49:30,600 --> 00:49:31,600
 - Lovely.

938
00:49:31,600 --> 00:49:35,600
 - But you do think the addition of one wire in the occasional person screaming as they pass.

939
00:49:35,600 --> 00:49:36,600
 - Yeah.

940
00:49:36,600 --> 00:49:37,600
 - Do you think?

941
00:49:37,600 --> 00:49:40,600
 - Well, you could think of the amount of Slate you could see in a short amount of time if

942
00:49:40,600 --> 00:49:41,600
 you had that zipline.

943
00:49:41,600 --> 00:49:42,600
 - Stop it.

944
00:49:42,600 --> 00:49:43,600
 Stop it.

945
00:49:43,600 --> 00:49:45,600
 You're trying to get me excited.

946
00:49:45,600 --> 00:49:46,600
 And it's working.

947
00:49:46,600 --> 00:49:49,600
 But it will be used to transport Slate in quiet periods.

948
00:49:49,600 --> 00:49:50,600
 - Is that right?

949
00:49:50,600 --> 00:49:51,600
 - Yeah, yeah.

950
00:49:51,600 --> 00:49:54,600
 I believe that's the arrangement they've come to.

951
00:49:54,600 --> 00:49:55,600
 - So it is going to happen?

952
00:49:55,600 --> 00:49:56,600
 - Yeah.

953
00:49:56,600 --> 00:49:57,600
 - Are you on a waiting list?

954
00:49:57,600 --> 00:49:58,600
 - Of course.

955
00:49:58,600 --> 00:49:59,600
 - Yeah.

956
00:49:59,600 --> 00:50:00,600
 - On a slating list.

957
00:50:00,600 --> 00:50:01,600
 - Oh, God.

958
00:50:01,600 --> 00:50:05,600
 - Anyway, just wanted to add my own personal anecdote.

959
00:50:05,600 --> 00:50:06,600
 - That's it.

960
00:50:06,600 --> 00:50:10,600
 - A very such good story that I wanted to talk to all of us.

961
00:50:10,600 --> 00:50:13,600
 - We know one of the dangers of going on a zipline.

962
00:50:13,600 --> 00:50:15,600
 I'm very glad you didn't get this.

963
00:50:15,600 --> 00:50:16,600
 - Tash!

964
00:50:16,600 --> 00:50:17,600
 They grow.

965
00:50:17,600 --> 00:50:18,600
 - Yes.

966
00:50:18,600 --> 00:50:19,600
 That's one of them.

967
00:50:19,600 --> 00:50:23,600
 - The other one is slamming into sloths.

968
00:50:23,600 --> 00:50:28,600
 So I've watched a video of a young boy in Costa Rica going down a zipline.

969
00:50:28,600 --> 00:50:31,600
 And behind him is either an instructor or a parent.

970
00:50:31,600 --> 00:50:32,600
 I don't quite know who.

971
00:50:32,600 --> 00:50:37,600
 And you see the video is just going super fast, super strong through this canopy.

972
00:50:37,600 --> 00:50:42,600
 And then suddenly you just see this ball of fur and he slams into it.

973
00:50:42,600 --> 00:50:46,600
 And fortunately the sloth doesn't lose grip, but they both stop.

974
00:50:46,600 --> 00:50:51,600
 And this sloth is just so confused and turns around.

975
00:50:51,600 --> 00:50:52,600
 - Was it all right?

976
00:50:52,600 --> 00:50:53,600
 - Yeah.

977
00:50:53,600 --> 00:50:54,600
 Well, it seemed to be okay.

978
00:50:54,600 --> 00:50:55,600
 It didn't drop.

979
00:50:55,600 --> 00:50:56,600
 Fortunately it was the boy.

980
00:50:56,600 --> 00:50:57,600
 - It was fine.

981
00:50:57,600 --> 00:50:58,600
 I saw that video as well.

982
00:50:58,600 --> 00:51:04,600
 And the person who was in charge, who was called Flavio Layton Ramos, he said the sloth or child

983
00:51:04,600 --> 00:51:05,600
 weren't hurt.

984
00:51:05,600 --> 00:51:10,600
 They just had to wait for the sloth to get out of the way for around 15 minutes.

985
00:51:10,600 --> 00:51:15,100
 - And you watch the sloth climbing away in this moment where its hands not on the wire

986
00:51:15,100 --> 00:51:16,100
 and it's taking so long.

987
00:51:16,100 --> 00:51:17,100
 - Oh, it's on the wire?

988
00:51:17,100 --> 00:51:18,100
 - Yeah, it's on the wire.

989
00:51:18,100 --> 00:51:20,100
 It's in the middle of the zip.

990
00:51:20,100 --> 00:51:21,100
 - Yeah.

991
00:51:21,100 --> 00:51:22,600
 So the zipline is going past a load of trees.

992
00:51:22,600 --> 00:51:26,600
 And so it's obviously been on one of the tree hanging branches and sort of thought this

993
00:51:26,600 --> 00:51:27,600
 was a branch.

994
00:51:27,600 --> 00:51:28,600
 - Yeah.

995
00:51:28,600 --> 00:51:29,600
 - Oh gosh.

996
00:51:29,600 --> 00:51:32,880
 - But it's literally, yeah, there's no tree near it for I guess 15 minutes because there's

997
00:51:32,880 --> 00:51:33,880
 no way for it.

998
00:51:33,880 --> 00:51:35,600
 It's got to just, it's like cliffhanger.

999
00:51:35,600 --> 00:51:36,600
 It was amazing.

1000
00:51:36,600 --> 00:51:38,600
 The intro a cliffhanger.

1001
00:51:38,600 --> 00:51:41,400
 - Isn't that where the zipline comes from, Costa Rica?

1002
00:51:41,400 --> 00:51:44,880
 The modern zipline was invented there by a bloke called Donald Perry.

1003
00:51:44,880 --> 00:51:45,880
 - That's right.

1004
00:51:45,880 --> 00:51:50,980
 - He kind of studied the canopy and there was no good way of going from tree to tree.

1005
00:51:50,980 --> 00:51:55,260
 So he turned up in 1979 with a crossbow, which is so cool.

1006
00:51:55,260 --> 00:51:56,260
 - That is cool.

1007
00:51:56,260 --> 00:51:59,260
 - He just started firing it around with a wire attached and bringing it up.

1008
00:51:59,260 --> 00:52:00,260
 What a guy.

1009
00:52:00,260 --> 00:52:05,380
 - They called him Hombrele Mono, which means Monkey Man in Costa Rica because he was using,

1010
00:52:05,380 --> 00:52:07,820
 you know, just using all these wires to get around.

1011
00:52:07,820 --> 00:52:08,820
 - So cool.

1012
00:52:08,820 --> 00:52:09,820
 - Really cool.

1013
00:52:09,820 --> 00:52:11,860
 - And he didn't patent it, I don't think.

1014
00:52:11,860 --> 00:52:15,620
 So someone else came along, well, but someone else came along and did do that.

1015
00:52:15,620 --> 00:52:20,880
 He was a sort of a businessman who wanted to make money off it and he was called Darren

1016
00:52:20,880 --> 00:52:24,880
 Hrenyuk and he's a Canadian guy.

1017
00:52:24,880 --> 00:52:31,280
 And when other people then started using ziplines, he used to go around and cut the ziplines

1018
00:52:31,280 --> 00:52:32,280
 down.

1019
00:52:32,280 --> 00:52:33,280
 - What?

1020
00:52:33,280 --> 00:52:34,280
 - But he would do it claiming it in a legal way.

1021
00:52:34,280 --> 00:52:39,000
 So in some cases he would bring, you know, a representative from a sort of official body

1022
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:41,000
 to sort of say, yes, this is a legal thing.

1023
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:45,280
 And so he'd go cutting these things down, even though he didn't have a claim to the invention

1024
00:52:45,280 --> 00:52:48,700
 of it because it was very clearly from this Perry guy.

1025
00:52:48,700 --> 00:52:49,700
 - Yeah.

1026
00:52:49,700 --> 00:52:50,700
 - Wow.

1027
00:52:50,700 --> 00:52:53,460
 - Can I tell you about a bloke called Jack Reynolds?

1028
00:52:53,460 --> 00:52:54,460
 - Yes, please.

1029
00:52:54,460 --> 00:52:59,500
 - Jack is the oldest man ever to use a zipline that we know of.

1030
00:52:59,500 --> 00:53:00,500
 It was 2018.

1031
00:53:00,500 --> 00:53:01,500
 He was 106 years old.

1032
00:53:01,500 --> 00:53:02,500
 - Very cool.

1033
00:53:02,500 --> 00:53:03,500
 - I know.

1034
00:53:03,500 --> 00:53:05,100
 I've got to say, just a shout out to Jack Reynolds.

1035
00:53:05,100 --> 00:53:10,540
 He's very sadly passed away, died in 2020, aged 108 in a bungee jump accident.

1036
00:53:10,540 --> 00:53:11,540
 - Yeah.

1037
00:53:11,540 --> 00:53:12,540
 - James, you joke.

1038
00:53:12,540 --> 00:53:13,540
 - Oh, no.

1039
00:53:13,540 --> 00:53:20,780
 - Yeah, but the year before the zipline, when he turned 105, he won oldest person to ride

1040
00:53:20,780 --> 00:53:24,300
 a non-inversion roller coaster, which I love.

1041
00:53:24,300 --> 00:53:25,300
 - Oh, yeah.

1042
00:53:25,300 --> 00:53:27,760
 - That was Twisted Sorus at Flamingo Land in Malton.

1043
00:53:27,760 --> 00:53:31,260
 On his 104th birthday, he got oldest person to receive their first tattoo.

1044
00:53:31,260 --> 00:53:32,260
 - Oh.

1045
00:53:32,260 --> 00:53:33,500
 - I remember this guy.

1046
00:53:33,500 --> 00:53:34,500
 - 1912.

1047
00:53:34,500 --> 00:53:35,500
 - Yeah.

1048
00:53:35,500 --> 00:53:36,500
 - He was born.

1049
00:53:36,500 --> 00:53:37,500
 It said Jack.

1050
00:53:37,500 --> 00:53:38,840
 - Did he go skydiving as well?

1051
00:53:38,840 --> 00:53:39,840
 - He went skydiving.

1052
00:53:39,840 --> 00:53:40,840
 That was another thing he did.

1053
00:53:40,840 --> 00:53:41,840
 - That's a good excuse.

1054
00:53:41,840 --> 00:53:43,940
 Like if people say, "Why have you never had a tattoo?"

1055
00:53:43,940 --> 00:53:44,940
 - Yeah.

1056
00:53:44,940 --> 00:53:47,980
 - You'd say, "Well, I'm holding out to become the world's oldest man to have his tattoo."

1057
00:53:47,980 --> 00:53:48,980
 - Yes.

1058
00:53:48,980 --> 00:53:49,980
 - Yeah.

1059
00:53:49,980 --> 00:53:50,980
 - Yeah.

1060
00:53:50,980 --> 00:53:54,140
 - And at the age of 108, sorry, at the age of 107, so the year before he died, he became

1061
00:53:54,140 --> 00:53:57,740
 the oldest person to, I think it was, have a cameo in a soap opera.

1062
00:53:57,740 --> 00:53:58,980
 He had been in Hollyoaks.

1063
00:53:58,980 --> 00:53:59,980
 - Oh.

1064
00:53:59,980 --> 00:54:00,980
 - No.

1065
00:54:00,980 --> 00:54:01,980
 - Yeah.

1066
00:54:01,980 --> 00:54:02,980
 - It was.

1067
00:54:02,980 --> 00:54:03,980
 - Does he work?

1068
00:54:03,980 --> 00:54:04,980
 - He had one line.

1069
00:54:04,980 --> 00:54:05,980
 He just said, "Don't worry.

1070
00:54:05,980 --> 00:54:08,820
 I'm very old, and I've had a great life, and you'll be all right," and all of that.

1071
00:54:08,820 --> 00:54:11,520
 - It was his first acting role in 100 years.

1072
00:54:11,520 --> 00:54:14,840
 - So he'd had a previous one when he was seven.

1073
00:54:14,840 --> 00:54:15,840
 - Yeah.

1074
00:54:15,840 --> 00:54:16,840
 - No.

1075
00:54:16,840 --> 00:54:17,840
 - What was it on?

1076
00:54:17,840 --> 00:54:18,840
 - I don't know.

1077
00:54:18,840 --> 00:54:21,840
 - He was on a train approaching the Garden Hall, wasn't he?

1078
00:54:21,840 --> 00:54:22,840
 That's amazing.

1079
00:54:22,840 --> 00:54:23,840
 The Hollyoaks.

1080
00:54:23,840 --> 00:54:24,840
 - I know.

1081
00:54:24,840 --> 00:54:26,340
 Hollyoaks as well, which is such a young show.

1082
00:54:26,340 --> 00:54:27,340
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1083
00:54:27,340 --> 00:54:35,480
 - That IMDB, though, just with a 100-year difference, two credits.

1084
00:54:35,480 --> 00:54:37,760
 - When was he on Hollyoaks?

1085
00:54:37,760 --> 00:54:40,580
 - That was the year before he died, so it would have been 2019.

1086
00:54:40,580 --> 00:54:41,580
 - Okay.

1087
00:54:41,580 --> 00:54:42,580
 Cool.

1088
00:54:42,580 --> 00:54:43,580
 - Yeah, yeah.

1089
00:54:43,580 --> 00:54:44,580
 Watch.

1090
00:54:44,580 --> 00:54:45,580
 How are they?

1091
00:54:45,580 --> 00:54:48,060
 - I have a friend who actually died over Christmas in Hollyoaks.

1092
00:54:48,060 --> 00:54:49,060
 - Oh.

1093
00:54:49,060 --> 00:54:50,060
 - In Hollyoaks.

1094
00:54:50,060 --> 00:54:51,060
 - In Hollyoaks.

1095
00:54:51,060 --> 00:54:52,060
 - Yeah.

1096
00:54:52,060 --> 00:54:53,060
 - Okay.

1097
00:54:53,060 --> 00:54:54,060
 - Yeah.

1098
00:54:54,060 --> 00:54:56,360
 And she got crushed by a bookcase.

1099
00:54:56,360 --> 00:55:04,580
 - By a 108-year-old man who's parachute didn't open.

1100
00:55:04,580 --> 00:55:11,800
 - Okay, that's it.

1101
00:55:11,800 --> 00:55:12,800
