00:00:03,00:00:04,"- Hi everyone, welcome to this week's episode"
00:00:04,00:00:06,"of ""No such thing as a fish,"""
00:00:06,00:00:09,which we recorded at the Underbelly Theatre
00:00:09,00:00:11,in London's Soho.
00:00:11,00:00:16,"It was the first try at our brand new touring show,"
00:00:16,00:00:19,but we did a full podcast in the middle of that show.
00:00:19,00:00:21,If you would like to see all of the other bits and bobs
00:00:21,00:00:23,"that we will do on tour,"
00:00:23,00:00:25,"then you'll have to go and get tickets,"
00:00:25,00:00:29,and you can get those at nosagethingsafish.com/live.
00:00:29,00:00:31,"At this place, you can also learn"
00:00:31,00:00:34,about our upcoming trip to Gothenburg.
00:00:34,00:00:37,We will be playing the Gothenburg Book Festival
00:00:37,00:00:39,on the 27th of September.
00:00:39,00:00:42,"That will be a simple podcast recording,"
00:00:42,00:00:44,"but if you want to see all the other bells and whistles,"
00:00:44,00:00:48,"including quizzes and special guests,"
00:00:48,00:00:50,and Andy probably talking nonsense
00:00:50,00:00:52,"about a very obscure subject,"
00:00:52,00:00:54,then you will have to come to one of our other shows
00:00:54,00:00:57,"in Bristol, Dublin, Glasgow, Newcastle, Cardiff, London,"
00:00:57,00:00:59,or Manchester.
00:00:59,00:01:01,"Again, details for all of these shows"
00:01:01,00:01:04,are at nosagethingsafish.com/live.
00:01:04,00:01:07,"We'll also do some shows in Australia and New Zealand,"
00:01:07,00:01:10,"but they are, frankly, almost all sold out."
00:01:10,00:01:12,"If you beg, borrow, and steal,"
00:01:12,00:01:14,you might be able to find one or two tickets
00:01:14,00:01:16,in Perth and Christchurch.
00:01:16,00:01:17,I think there might be one or two
00:01:17,00:01:21,"in our second additional show in Sydney,"
00:01:21,00:01:22,"but if you are living down under,"
00:01:22,00:01:24,then really you should try and get those tickets
00:01:24,00:01:25,"as soon as possible,"
00:01:25,00:01:28,because they are virtually sold out.
00:01:28,00:01:31,"While I'm here, it would be remiss of me not to remind you"
00:01:31,00:01:33,that we've all written lots of books.
00:01:33,00:01:36,Anna and I have written a book called A Load of Old Balls.
00:01:36,00:01:39,"Dan has got a book called The Theory of Everything Else,"
00:01:39,00:01:42,"as well as a kids book called Impossible Things,"
00:01:42,00:01:46,"and he has written novels, The Last Day, The Century,"
00:01:46,00:01:47,A Beginner's Guide to Breaking and Entering
00:01:47,00:01:49,is his latest one.
00:01:49,00:01:50,If you're looking for something to read
00:01:50,00:01:52,"over the remaining part of summer,"
00:01:52,00:01:55,"or indeed as the nights begin to draw in,"
00:01:55,00:01:57,"then please do consider getting our books,"
00:01:57,00:01:59,"because it makes us, and indeed our publishers,"
00:01:59,00:02:01,very happy when you do so.
00:02:01,00:02:03,"Anyway, enough of trying to sell you stuff."
00:02:03,00:02:06,"The podcast is free, and of course, we'll always be free."
00:02:06,00:02:09,"And so please do enjoy this free podcast,"
00:02:09,00:02:13,recorded live at the Underbelly Theatre in Soho.
00:02:13,00:02:15,"Okay, on with the podcast."
00:02:15,00:02:24,- There we go.
00:02:24,00:02:27,(upbeat music)
00:02:27,00:02:34,"- Hello, and welcome to another episode"
00:02:34,00:02:37,"of No Such Thing as a Fish, a weekly podcast,"
00:02:37,00:02:39,this week coming to you live
00:02:39,00:02:41,from the Underbelly Boulevard in Soho.
00:02:41,00:02:44,(audience cheering)
00:02:44,00:02:48,- My name is Dan Schreiber.
00:02:48,00:02:50,"I am sitting here with Anna Tyshinski,"
00:02:50,00:02:52,"Andrew Hunter Murray, and James Harkin."
00:02:52,00:02:54,"And once again, we have gathered around the microphones"
00:02:54,00:02:57,"with our four favorite facts from the last seven days,"
00:02:57,00:03:00,"and in no particular order, here we go,"
00:03:00,00:03:03,"starting with fact number one, and that is Anna."
00:03:03,00:03:05,- My fact this week is that Chinese students
00:03:05,00:03:09,in the 1700s could rent underwear with test answers on it
00:03:09,00:03:12,to smuggle into exam halls.
00:03:12,00:03:13,- Wow.
00:03:13,00:03:14,Do you say rent?
00:03:14,00:03:16,(audience laughing)
00:03:16,00:03:18,"- If there are rental shops that are doing this,"
00:03:18,00:03:19,surely the schools would be aware
00:03:19,00:03:21,"that that was a thing, right?"
00:03:21,00:03:23,"- I think people were aware,"
00:03:23,00:03:26,but the cheaters kept on getting smarter and smarter.
00:03:26,00:03:27,That's the thing about cheaters.
00:03:27,00:03:30,They can always outwit the boring law abiders.
00:03:30,00:03:34,"This is in the civil service exams,"
00:03:34,00:03:36,"very famous Chinese civil service exams,"
00:03:36,00:03:40,"by far the oldest meritocratic system in the world,"
00:03:40,00:03:43,going since the seventh century.
00:03:43,00:03:45,"This exam is extremely hard to pass,"
00:03:45,00:03:46,"but if you did pass it,"
00:03:46,00:03:48,you could be in the Chinese civil service.
00:03:48,00:03:49,It was very prestigious.
00:03:49,00:03:53,"The exam's basically unchanged for 1500 years,"
00:03:53,00:03:56,and throughout the period that existed
00:03:56,00:04:00,"from the seventh century to the start of the 20th century,"
00:04:00,00:04:02,there are these amazing stories of how people cheated.
00:04:02,00:04:03,"- I'm sorry, I'm sorry."
00:04:03,00:04:06,"If it's unchanged for 1500 years, I think I could pass."
00:04:06,00:04:07,(audience laughing)
00:04:07,00:04:08,"- Oh yeah, Randy."
00:04:08,00:04:11,We're looking at a picture of a shirt.
00:04:11,00:04:12,(audience laughing)
00:04:12,00:04:14,"I would like to see you memorize that,"
00:04:14,00:04:15,even if it was in English.
00:04:15,00:04:19,"It's unbelievably tiny characters on this vest, isn't it?"
00:04:19,00:04:20,- Yeah.
00:04:20,00:04:22,"- It is, and this is one of the cheating garments."
00:04:22,00:04:24,So these things were called cribbing garments.
00:04:24,00:04:27,"And yeah, so there's evidence in the 1700s"
00:04:27,00:04:31,of underwear made of paper with essays written on it.
00:04:31,00:04:33,"Or, it's--"
00:04:33,00:04:34,"- Well, that says to me that what you can do"
00:04:34,00:04:38,is just sort of remove one sheet at a time and hand it in.
00:04:38,00:04:39,(audience laughing)
00:04:39,00:04:41,- Surely you'd have to be rummaging around
00:04:41,00:04:43,"in your undergarments to get the answers that you need,"
00:04:43,00:04:45,'cause what you'd need is to learn a lot of Confucius.
00:04:45,00:04:47,"That's basically what the exam is, isn't it?"
00:04:47,00:04:49,"You have to memorize 400,000 characters."
00:04:49,00:04:50,- Lots of learning by rote.
00:04:50,00:04:51,Michael Gove would have loved it.
00:04:51,00:04:52,- Yeah.
00:04:52,00:04:53,(audience laughing)
00:04:53,00:04:54,- It's just bizarre for all in the system.
00:04:54,00:04:56,They were so rigorous about catching cheaters.
00:04:56,00:04:58,"They stripped, actually, they did everything,"
00:04:58,00:05:01,but they then put you in an enclosed cubicle
00:05:01,00:05:03,for a few days to do the exam.
00:05:03,00:05:04,"And in that enclosed cubicle,"
00:05:04,00:05:06,"you suddenly were about your underwear,"
00:05:06,00:05:08,or the things you could actually rent
00:05:08,00:05:10,were little scripts that you were meant to sew
00:05:10,00:05:12,into your underwear or into your underclothes
00:05:12,00:05:13,"with the test answers on them,"
00:05:13,00:05:16,"but it was absolutely tiny, the writing."
00:05:16,00:05:18,I think there was one which contained
00:05:18,00:05:20,"722 finished compositions,"
00:05:20,00:05:23,"which was 520,000 characters,"
00:05:23,00:05:25,and it was just in the underlining of the shirt.
00:05:25,00:05:27,- It's because basically it was a question.
00:05:27,00:05:29,"You knew what the question was gonna be,"
00:05:29,00:05:31,"and you knew what the answer was,"
00:05:31,00:05:33,"but the test was, can you remember the answer?"
00:05:33,00:05:33,- Right.
00:05:33,00:05:34,- And it's really long.
00:05:34,00:05:35,"- Oh, it's a pure repetition."
00:05:35,00:05:36,"- Pretty much, yeah."
00:05:36,00:05:37,- It's not right.
00:05:37,00:05:39,"- And those, and that tiny, tiny writing"
00:05:39,00:05:40,is what they use today to make the labels
00:05:40,00:05:43,with the washing instructions that go into your--
00:05:43,00:05:44,- It's not so.
00:05:44,00:05:44,- That's true.
00:05:44,00:05:45,- Is it?
00:05:45,00:05:48,- So they locked you away for three days?
00:05:48,00:05:49,"- They did, yeah, yeah."
00:05:49,00:05:50,- Did you do the exam?
00:05:50,00:05:52,"- Yeah, and you were very much locked."
00:05:52,00:05:53,- Could you take food and drink it?
00:05:53,00:05:55,"- Yes, you bought your own little packed lunch, is?"
00:05:55,00:05:58,"- Well, I would write on a sausage my answers."
00:05:58,00:05:59,You know?
00:05:59,00:06:01,"- Yeah, if the evidence after, right?"
00:06:01,00:06:03,They can find it.
00:06:03,00:06:05,- Why are you bringing such an enormously long sausage
00:06:05,00:06:07,"into the exam, Andy?"
00:06:07,00:06:10,"Well, thanks for asking."
00:06:10,00:06:14,"And the room where you were, at least one of them,"
00:06:14,00:06:17,"this is the examination hall in Jiangnan,"
00:06:17,00:06:18,"you had your little room,"
00:06:18,00:06:19,"and there was lots of different rooms,"
00:06:19,00:06:21,"and then there was sort of an outer corridor,"
00:06:21,00:06:25,and then it was surrounded by walls full of thorns
00:06:25,00:06:27,so that no one could come in and give you the answers.
00:06:27,00:06:28,- Wow.
00:06:28,00:06:29,- That is clever.
00:06:29,00:06:31,"- And yeah, people kept outwitting it."
00:06:31,00:06:32,- Yeah?
00:06:32,00:06:34,"- No one's ever gone to such great lengths to stop cheats,"
00:06:34,00:06:36,and it just made the cheats better and better.
00:06:36,00:06:38,"They used the dig tunnels underneath,"
00:06:38,00:06:40,and then deliver notes to the students.
00:06:40,00:06:41,- Really?
00:06:41,00:06:42,- You must have had to be so precise
00:06:42,00:06:44,to get the exact cubicle that the student was in.
00:06:44,00:06:46,There's tens of thousands of people.
00:06:46,00:06:48,You just pop up in a stranger's cubicle.
00:06:48,00:06:51,- He's taking a shit while you're throwing up.
00:06:51,00:06:53,- I've actually written the answers on this shit.
00:06:53,00:06:56,(laughter)
00:06:56,00:06:57,"- Well, it sounds like it hasn't changed, though, right?"
00:06:57,00:07:00,"Because modern China, I think it's still the case"
00:07:00,00:07:02,that every year around 9.1 million high school students
00:07:02,00:07:05,"are doing exams to go into university,"
00:07:05,00:07:08,and it's a nightmare getting them to the exams.
00:07:08,00:07:09,"Like, that's one of the biggest things"
00:07:09,00:07:11,because everyone's really on edge.
00:07:11,00:07:12,You've got to get them from home there.
00:07:12,00:07:14,"So, like, on days where the exams are happening,"
00:07:14,00:07:16,there'll be very specific traffic lanes
00:07:16,00:07:19,that are purely for students taking exams.
00:07:19,00:07:21,"Yeah, the families can drive them in."
00:07:21,00:07:23,"So, it's like, yeah, exam day, this is the lane."
00:07:23,00:07:25,"Express lane, purely for students."
00:07:25,00:07:26,- That's cool.
00:07:26,00:07:27,- Yeah.
00:07:27,00:07:30,"- So, Dan, you grew up in Hong Kong, partly."
00:07:30,00:07:32,I know you weren't probably there with the edge
00:07:32,00:07:33,"that you would have been taking these exams,"
00:07:33,00:07:36,and you weren't trying to get into the Chinese civil service.
00:07:36,00:07:37,- You didn't know that?
00:07:37,00:07:38,"- I mean, you're here now,"
00:07:38,00:07:40,so things weren't pretty badly wrong.
00:07:40,00:07:42,(laughing)
00:07:42,00:07:43,- At last.
00:07:43,00:07:44,- Yeah.
00:07:44,00:07:47,(laughing)
00:07:47,00:07:48,- That is deep cover.
00:07:48,00:07:51,(laughing)
00:07:51,00:07:54,- Did you ever get the advice from your parents
00:07:54,00:07:55,"of if you do badly, your mother will die"
00:07:55,00:07:57,in a pauper's grave?
00:07:57,00:07:58,Did they ever say that to you?
00:07:58,00:07:59,"- Well, my mum and dad are here."
00:07:59,00:08:01,Did you ever say that to me?
00:08:01,00:08:04,"- No, apparently not, yeah."
00:08:04,00:08:06,"- And where has that come from, that advice?"
00:08:06,00:08:07,"- Apparently, as they're saying,"
00:08:07,00:08:09,sometimes that Chinese high schoolers
00:08:09,00:08:11,with especially straight parents get told.
00:08:11,00:08:11,- Wow.
00:08:11,00:08:13,Do you wanna hear some of the questions
00:08:13,00:08:15,from modern day Chinese civil service exams?
00:08:15,00:08:16,- Yeah. - Wow.
00:08:16,00:08:18,"- Actually, these are to get into"
00:08:18,00:08:20,the next level of schooling.
00:08:20,00:08:21,- Okay.
00:08:21,00:08:22,- I like university kind of thing.
00:08:22,00:08:25,The containers for milk are always square boxes.
00:08:25,00:08:28,Containers for mineral water are always round bottles.
00:08:28,00:08:31,Round wine bottles are usually placed in square boxes.
00:08:31,00:08:34,Write a composition on the subtle philosophy
00:08:34,00:08:35,of round and square.
00:08:35,00:08:38,(laughing)
00:08:38,00:08:40,"- Um, no, I do know this one."
00:08:40,00:08:43,(laughing)
00:08:43,00:08:44,"Is that a modern, that's the one one?"
00:08:44,00:08:45,"- Yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:08:45,00:08:45,"- Yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:08:45,00:08:46,"- Oh, I did that one."
00:08:46,00:08:47,- Yeah.
00:08:47,00:08:48,(laughing)
00:08:48,00:08:49,- Here's one.
00:08:49,00:08:52,It flies upward and a voice asks if it is tired.
00:08:52,00:08:54,It says no.
00:08:54,00:08:55,That's it.
00:08:55,00:08:56,- I'd say it.
00:08:56,00:08:58,"Oh, I'd say it's, I'd say it's, I'd say it's."
00:08:58,00:08:59,- A toddler in a helicopter.
00:08:59,00:09:02,(laughing)
00:09:02,00:09:03,- You must be tired.
00:09:03,00:09:04,We've been out all day.
00:09:04,00:09:06,"I'm not tired, I'm not tired."
00:09:06,00:09:07,- Do you know the answer?
00:09:07,00:09:08,- No.
00:09:08,00:09:09,- Why not?
00:09:09,00:09:11,- It's not a question.
00:09:11,00:09:13,"- No, it's a prompt rather than a question, let's say."
00:09:13,00:09:14,"- Oh, okay."
00:09:14,00:09:18,"- Another one, comment on the civilized behavior in Beijing."
00:09:18,00:09:20,(laughing)
00:09:20,00:09:22,"- Don't, Andy, don't."
00:09:22,00:09:23,(laughing)
00:09:23,00:09:25,"- No, okay."
00:09:25,00:09:28,- For what object you have a passion deep in the soul?
00:09:28,00:09:32,"You could choose a plant, an animal, or a utensil."
00:09:32,00:09:35,"- Oh, it's a great question."
00:09:35,00:09:37,"- I see, I think I see what's happened here."
00:09:37,00:09:38,- And it's problematic.
00:09:38,00:09:39,"Basically, the one big criticism"
00:09:39,00:09:41,of the civil service exams historically
00:09:41,00:09:43,was that they were too pro-former
00:09:43,00:09:44,"and they were all about learning by rote,"
00:09:44,00:09:46,didn't encourage creative thinking.
00:09:46,00:09:47,And I think what they've done is they've swung
00:09:47,00:09:49,way too far the other way.
00:09:49,00:09:51,(laughing)
00:09:51,00:09:54,"- Ah, there was a good cheating scandal."
00:09:54,00:09:55,"Well, there were a few great ones recently actually."
00:09:55,00:09:57,This was a niche one that I didn't know about.
00:09:57,00:09:59,This was in Montana in 2014.
00:09:59,00:10:03,And it was about 90 young officers in the military.
00:10:03,00:10:05,They were caught in a cheating scandal
00:10:05,00:10:06,where they'd been texting each other all the answers
00:10:06,00:10:08,for their questions.
00:10:08,00:10:09,They had to do a monthly test.
00:10:09,00:10:11,"Unfortunately, they were the officers"
00:10:11,00:10:13,in charge of nuclear missile launch
00:10:13,00:10:15,at the Malmström Air Force Base
00:10:15,00:10:17,and they had just been cheating all the way through.
00:10:17,00:10:19,"And 'cause they'd been really worried,"
00:10:19,00:10:20,they thought they had to get 100%
00:10:20,00:10:22,when actually it's only a 90% pass mark.
00:10:22,00:10:24,"So, yeah."
00:10:24,00:10:26,"- Wait, and they ended up in charge of--"
00:10:26,00:10:27,- Nuclear launch.
00:10:27,00:10:27,- Right.
00:10:27,00:10:29,"At that point, did they think"
00:10:29,00:10:31,we may have prioritized the wrong thing here?
00:10:31,00:10:33,- They were all taken off their work.
00:10:33,00:10:35,And that's why no nukes were launched in 2014.
00:10:35,00:10:37,"- Well, thank God."
00:10:37,00:10:39,"- Thank God, yeah."
00:10:39,00:10:40,- Did you guys ever cheat?
00:10:40,00:10:40,Were you cheaters?
00:10:40,00:10:41,- No. - No.
00:10:41,00:10:43,- Goodness no.
00:10:43,00:10:47,"- Come on, you're just more dishonest cheaters than I am."
00:10:47,00:10:49,"- No, I would have shopped a cheater if I'd seen one,"
00:10:49,00:10:51,but I was too busy focusing on my own work.
00:10:51,00:10:53,(audience laughs)
00:10:53,00:10:54,- I actually cheated for this episode.
00:10:54,00:10:55,- Did you?
00:10:55,00:10:56,"- I sure did, yeah."
00:10:56,00:10:59,I asked ChatGPT for an interesting fact about cheating.
00:10:59,00:11:00,- Did you?
00:11:00,00:11:01,- Did you?
00:11:01,00:11:02,"- Yeah, sure did."
00:11:02,00:11:04,"I said, ""Please make it surprising, unusual and quirky."""
00:11:04,00:11:07,"They said the headline, ""Pigeons as Messengers."""
00:11:07,00:11:10,"In the early 2000s, some students in China"
00:11:10,00:11:11,trained pigeons to carry crib sheets.
00:11:11,00:11:13,The pigeons were released from home
00:11:13,00:11:14,with the arms as tight as their legs
00:11:14,00:11:16,and flew to the students during exams.
00:11:16,00:11:18,It was hard to detect until the authorities
00:11:18,00:11:19,caught onto the flocks of pigeons
00:11:19,00:11:21,loitering around the exam halls.
00:11:21,00:11:23,(audience laughs)
00:11:23,00:11:25,"Now, I have to say, I have tried to fact check this"
00:11:25,00:11:27,and I can't find the evidence.
00:11:27,00:11:29,(audience laughs)
00:11:29,00:11:32,But I trust the robots as I think we all should.
00:11:32,00:11:33,(audience laughs)
00:11:33,00:11:35,"- So why, when you can't find a source for my facts,"
00:11:35,00:11:36,do you not trust it?
00:11:36,00:11:38,(audience laughs)
00:11:38,00:11:40,"- The future is not in your hands, Dan."
00:11:40,00:11:41,"Thank God, so."
00:11:41,00:11:44,- Have you guys seen the cheating hats that you can get?
00:11:44,00:11:46,"So it's not, you can't actually buy them in retail shops,"
00:11:46,00:11:48,but they happen in school classes
00:11:48,00:11:49,where teachers are a bit concerned
00:11:49,00:11:51,and they make peripheral blockers.
00:11:51,00:11:55,So you wear big elephant ears on the side of this hat.
00:11:55,00:11:57,"So that if you try and look that way,"
00:11:57,00:11:58,"they're sort of sitting there, blocking you in."
00:11:58,00:12:01,- I would write the answers on the wings.
00:12:01,00:12:02,"- Oh, yes."
00:12:02,00:12:03,"Very nice, yeah."
00:12:03,00:12:05,- But I read an article about that
00:12:05,00:12:08,and it said that actually students quite like it.
00:12:08,00:12:10,They kind of feel like they're less stressed
00:12:10,00:12:12,"because like normally they're thinking,"
00:12:12,00:12:14,"""Oh, people are thinking I'm going to be cheating,"""
00:12:14,00:12:16,but it kind of takes it completely out of the equation.
00:12:16,00:12:19,"- How the horse loves his blinkers, in a way."
00:12:19,00:12:20,"- Oh, to see?"
00:12:20,00:12:21,"- I don't know, actually."
00:12:21,00:12:23,"I mean, I don't know if horses like blinkers."
00:12:23,00:12:26,- There's another really good way of stopping people.
00:12:26,00:12:28,"This is five and six year olds,"
00:12:28,00:12:30,"but it stops them from cheating, right?"
00:12:30,00:12:31,You get them all in a room doing their exam.
00:12:31,00:12:35,They're in lines and you walk in with a magic wand
00:12:35,00:12:37,"and you say, ""I'm magicing a barrier between you"
00:12:37,00:12:40,"""so you can't read each other's answers,"""
00:12:40,00:12:42,and that is enough to stop them from even trying.
00:12:42,00:12:44,- Really?
00:12:44,00:12:45,- They're faking it.
00:12:45,00:12:47,"- You're right, that's great."
00:12:47,00:12:49,Now there's been a recent study in they found
00:12:49,00:12:50,that cheating went down by 20%
00:12:50,00:12:53,by people who did the magic wand tactic.
00:12:53,00:12:54,- Oh my.
00:12:54,00:12:55,- The Slytherin.
00:12:55,00:12:55,You could sort them right there in there.
00:12:55,00:12:58,(laughing)
00:12:58,00:13:00,"- So in the 15th century, there was an exam"
00:13:00,00:13:02,"with one question that was so hard,"
00:13:02,00:13:05,only two men in the entire country got it right.
00:13:05,00:13:06,- Oh wow.
00:13:06,00:13:09,"- It was Tang Yin and his friend, Zhu Jing."
00:13:09,00:13:11,- They were both friends and they got it right.
00:13:11,00:13:12,- They were both friends and they got it right.
00:13:12,00:13:14,"And so obviously everyone thought,"
00:13:14,00:13:16,"just as Andy thought, ""How interesting."""
00:13:16,00:13:19,"And so they were arrested,"
00:13:19,00:13:22,"accused of bribing officials,"
00:13:22,00:13:25,"and they all the way said that they didn't do it,"
00:13:25,00:13:27,but Zhu spent his entire rest of his life
00:13:27,00:13:29,waiting for a pardon which never came.
00:13:29,00:13:31,He didn't get his job.
00:13:31,00:13:33,And it was so bad that all of his descendants
00:13:33,00:13:35,also refused to take the exam.
00:13:35,00:13:37,"- Wait, they refused to take it?"
00:13:37,00:13:38,Or they were refused?
00:13:38,00:13:39,- They refused to take it.
00:13:39,00:13:41,"They were like, ""No, we don't believe in this anymore."""
00:13:41,00:13:45,And his great-great-grandson who's called Zhu Ziaky.
00:13:45,00:13:47,"So that's, think about how long that is later."
00:13:47,00:13:49,He decided he wasn't gonna take this exam
00:13:49,00:13:51,because his great-great-grandfather
00:13:51,00:13:53,had been accused of cheating.
00:13:53,00:13:56,And he became China's most influential travel writer
00:13:56,00:13:59,of whatever century was the 18th century.
00:13:59,00:14:01,"Because he would have gone, he was a genius."
00:14:01,00:14:03,He would have gone into the civil service
00:14:03,00:14:05,because he didn't wanna take the exam.
00:14:05,00:14:06,He did this instead.
00:14:06,00:14:07,- That's exactly why I didn't take it
00:14:07,00:14:09,when I was given the chance.
00:14:09,00:14:10,I had more to give.
00:14:10,00:14:14,(all laughing)
00:14:14,00:14:15,- When are you gonna start giving it down?
00:14:15,00:14:17,(all laughing)
00:14:17,00:14:20,(upbeat music)
00:14:20,00:14:26,"- It is time for fact number two, and that is Andy."
00:14:26,00:14:29,"My fact is that in 2004, musician Jack White"
00:14:29,00:14:32,released a single through the medium of a couch.
00:14:32,00:14:33,- Ooh.
00:14:33,00:14:37,"- So Jack White, he was an upholsterer as a young man."
00:14:37,00:14:40,And one of his first bands actually was with another guy
00:14:40,00:14:41,who was an upholsterer.
00:14:41,00:14:43,They were a two piece band.
00:14:43,00:14:43,"- Oh, that's cool."
00:14:43,00:14:45,- And they were upholstering by day and playing by night
00:14:45,00:14:48,"and they had a great, then the band name was, any guesses?"
00:14:48,00:14:52,"- I was like, ""Swayed is much better."""
00:14:52,00:14:54,- They were called the upholsterers.
00:14:54,00:14:56,(all laughing)
00:14:56,00:14:57,- Okay.
00:14:57,00:14:59,"- It's so clever, it's so simple, it's clever."
00:14:59,00:15:01,"- Yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:15:01,00:15:03,- But he is better known as being in the White Stripes.
00:15:03,00:15:05,"- Sorry, yes, White Stripes, and numerous other--"
00:15:05,00:15:06,- Not to Andy.
00:15:06,00:15:09,(all laughing)
00:15:09,00:15:10,- The Who?
00:15:10,00:15:11,"- No, I lost it."
00:15:11,00:15:12,"- No, no, no, no, fuck."
00:15:12,00:15:15,(all laughing)
00:15:15,00:15:19,"- So, they were in Detroit in 2004."
00:15:19,00:15:21,"I think he just set up the White Stripes with Meg White,"
00:15:21,00:15:23,but they had this little band and they were working
00:15:23,00:15:27,in an upholstery shop and they smuggled 100 singles
00:15:27,00:15:31,on vinyl into sofas in the shop that they were working in
00:15:31,00:15:34,and armchairs and only two have ever been found so far.
00:15:34,00:15:35,- Yeah.
00:15:35,00:15:36,"- So, how's that?"
00:15:36,00:15:37,"- So, is it worth us ripping up our sofas?"
00:15:37,00:15:38,"- Yes, it is."
00:15:38,00:15:40,Go home tonight.
00:15:40,00:15:41,"- 'Cause you don't know, yeah."
00:15:41,00:15:42,- And get busy.
00:15:42,00:15:46,"And you won't be, even if you've got an x-ray machine,"
00:15:46,00:15:47,you won't be able to x-ray it 'cause they did it
00:15:47,00:15:50,on transparent clear vinyl with transparency covers.
00:15:50,00:15:51,"So, you cannot see it."
00:15:51,00:15:53,You can only know by destroying the sofa.
00:15:53,00:15:54,"- They did this as a secret,"
00:15:54,00:15:56,but we released a vinyl didn't we?
00:15:56,00:16:00,"Years ago with Altenpop, this amazing record label."
00:16:00,00:16:01,And we also sold two copies.
00:16:01,00:16:03,(all laughing)
00:16:03,00:16:06,But they had this amazing idea for one of their bands
00:16:06,00:16:08,"where they released the album,"
00:16:08,00:16:10,but the only way you could buy the album
00:16:10,00:16:12,was to get it on the USB stick that they provided.
00:16:12,00:16:15,But the USB stick only came connected
00:16:15,00:16:17,to a very expensive bicycle.
00:16:17,00:16:19,"So, you had to buy the bicycle in order to do it."
00:16:19,00:16:21,"So, to buy the bicycle, that equates it"
00:16:21,00:16:23,"to something like 1,000 record sales"
00:16:23,00:16:24,because it was a really good bike.
00:16:24,00:16:27,"And so, the band technically sold,"
00:16:27,00:16:29,"in terms of building back their royalties, 1,000 copies."
00:16:29,00:16:32,"So, that is ways that bands do that now."
00:16:32,00:16:34,"- Wait, so did they just sell one?"
00:16:34,00:16:35,- Just one.
00:16:35,00:16:36,- One sucker bought the bike.
00:16:36,00:16:37,- Yeah.
00:16:37,00:16:37,- Okay.
00:16:37,00:16:38,(laughing)
00:16:38,00:16:40,- Things in sofas?
00:16:40,00:16:41,- Sure.
00:16:41,00:16:42,- Things in sofas.
00:16:42,00:16:44,"- If anyone is a phobic of snakes,"
00:16:44,00:16:46,might want to pop out for a bit.
00:16:46,00:16:47,(audience laughing)
00:16:47,00:16:49,This was something that happened quite recently.
00:16:49,00:16:51,"North Ayrshire, in Scotland,"
00:16:51,00:16:53,staff were cleaning a sofa at a second-hand shop
00:16:53,00:16:55,and a python fell out of it.
00:16:55,00:16:56,- Oh.
00:16:56,00:16:57,- Dead?
00:16:57,00:16:57,- Dead.
00:16:57,00:16:58,- Okay.
00:16:58,00:16:59,"- So, that's fine."
00:16:59,00:17:00,"So, it was a second-hand shop and they were cleaning it."
00:17:00,00:17:01,- Not fine for the python.
00:17:01,00:17:02,- Not fine for the python.
00:17:02,00:17:05,"But, get this, the people who donated the sofa"
00:17:05,00:17:07,confirmed that they had never had a pet snake
00:17:07,00:17:10,and that they had got it second-hand themselves.
00:17:10,00:17:12,"So, it had been the whole time they had owned it."
00:17:12,00:17:14,It had probably been in there.
00:17:14,00:17:15,- Right.
00:17:15,00:17:16,- Did they not decompose pythons?
00:17:16,00:17:17,- No.
00:17:17,00:17:19,- Is there something special about that?
00:17:19,00:17:19,(audience laughing)
00:17:19,00:17:20,"And that's why when you walk the streets of London,"
00:17:20,00:17:22,you'd ankle deep in dead pythons.
00:17:22,00:17:23,- Yeah.
00:17:23,00:17:24,"- They'd just stick around, yeah."
00:17:24,00:17:25,- Amazing.
00:17:25,00:17:26,- I know.
00:17:26,00:17:28,"And the spokesman for the second-hand place said,"
00:17:28,00:17:30,"""Don't let this discourage you from buying re-use"
00:17:30,00:17:31,from others.
00:17:31,00:17:32,"This is a very, very rare downside."""
00:17:32,00:17:34,(audience laughing)
00:17:34,00:17:37,"- There was a study in, well, there were two studies in 2016"
00:17:37,00:17:39,and one of them found that the typical Brit
00:17:39,00:17:43,"finds £3.27 a year in their sofa,"
00:17:43,00:17:44,which is exciting.
00:17:44,00:17:46,That was in March.
00:17:46,00:17:48,"And then, in October, there was another study"
00:17:48,00:17:52,showing that the average Brit finds £5.77 in their sofa.
00:17:52,00:17:53,What's happened between--
00:17:53,00:17:55,"- Well, obviously, the first study"
00:17:55,00:17:57,has brought it to everyone's attention
00:17:57,00:17:58,"and everyone's gone, ""Oh, I'm going to look at myself"
00:17:58,00:17:59,"in that one."" - Oh, yeah."
00:17:59,00:18:00,- The average has gone way up.
00:18:00,00:18:01,- What year was this?
00:18:01,00:18:02,Was this recently?
00:18:02,00:18:03,- 2016.
00:18:03,00:18:04,- 2016.
00:18:04,00:18:04,- I feel like it's going down.
00:18:04,00:18:05,- It must have changed since then.
00:18:05,00:18:06,"- Yeah, yeah."
00:18:06,00:18:08,"- These days, you'll find half a Bitcoin down there."
00:18:08,00:18:09,(audience laughing)
00:18:09,00:18:13,- I read the study from 2017 that said 52% of people
00:18:13,00:18:16,had lost money down the side of their sofa
00:18:16,00:18:21,and only 46% said they found any money down their sofa.
00:18:21,00:18:22,- So there's money to be found?
00:18:22,00:18:25,"- No, unfortunately, 6% of people said"
00:18:25,00:18:27,they found money down someone else's sofa.
00:18:27,00:18:30,(audience laughing)
00:18:30,00:18:34,"- Hey, I read a crazy thing about sofas."
00:18:34,00:18:35,This blew my mind today.
00:18:35,00:18:37,If you go and you off to buy a sofa
00:18:37,00:18:39,and you want to get a leather sofa
00:18:39,00:18:42,"and you see in the shop, it says genuine leather,"
00:18:42,00:18:45,"you go, ""Ah, that's going to be a great sofa,"" right?"
00:18:45,00:18:46,- Right.
00:18:46,00:18:47,- It's a cheat.
00:18:47,00:18:48,It's a cheat.
00:18:48,00:18:48,- What?
00:18:48,00:18:49,- It's okay.
00:18:49,00:18:51,There are five kinds of leather sofas
00:18:51,00:18:54,that you can get in terms of quality
00:18:54,00:18:57,and the fourth worst is genuine leather
00:18:57,00:18:59,because they just call it genuine leather.
00:18:59,00:19:00,That's its name.
00:19:00,00:19:01,- Is it not leather?
00:19:01,00:19:03,"- No, it can be up to the discretion of the maker."
00:19:03,00:19:06,It could be anything between one and 100% leather.
00:19:06,00:19:08,They could put 2% leather in there
00:19:08,00:19:10,and they market it as genuine leather
00:19:10,00:19:12,'cause that's what you call that style.
00:19:12,00:19:13,- Oh my God.
00:19:13,00:19:14,- Who do we write to?
00:19:14,00:19:16,- We are about to get sued by DFS.
00:19:16,00:19:18,- Really?
00:19:18,00:19:19,What are the other things called?
00:19:19,00:19:21,What's the genuine leather?
00:19:21,00:19:23,"Okay, full grain leather is number one."
00:19:23,00:19:25,"Top grain leather is number two,"
00:19:25,00:19:26,"which again, a bit confusing."
00:19:26,00:19:29,"Split grain leather, number three."
00:19:29,00:19:31,Genuine leather comes in at number four
00:19:31,00:19:32,"and then bonded leather,"
00:19:32,00:19:34,which is basically just whatever the fuck
00:19:34,00:19:36,they want to put together.
00:19:36,00:19:38,- What's the 1% leather?
00:19:38,00:19:39,"That's not good, yeah."
00:19:39,00:19:41,"- Yeah, so just next time you're in a shop"
00:19:41,00:19:42,"and you see genuine leather, it's not."
00:19:42,00:19:43,- Good Lord.
00:19:43,00:19:44,- That's really good.
00:19:44,00:19:46,You should do consumer programs.
00:19:46,00:19:47,- Oh yeah.
00:19:47,00:19:49,- I see that in your stars.
00:19:49,00:19:52,"Last year, police found something"
00:19:52,00:19:55,down the back of a sofa in Florida
00:19:55,00:19:57,and it was a suspected drug dealer named Stacy.
00:19:57,00:20:02,And she was caught between the folds of a sofa.
00:20:02,00:20:03,- Oh my God.
00:20:03,00:20:06,"- She was in there, the arrest photo is phenomenally good."
00:20:06,00:20:07,It's so good.
00:20:07,00:20:08,She's just emerging.
00:20:08,00:20:09,"- But that is the most,"
00:20:09,00:20:12,it's one of the most insanely awesome disguises
00:20:12,00:20:12,you'll ever see.
00:20:12,00:20:14,"I know we've mentioned this a bunch of times before,"
00:20:14,00:20:17,but like people who were trying to get across
00:20:17,00:20:18,from one side of Germany to the other
00:20:18,00:20:20,"during the Berlin Wall, they would go in cars"
00:20:20,00:20:22,and they would be the passenger seat.
00:20:22,00:20:25,"So they would be inside, sitting within the leather."
00:20:25,00:20:27,Back in the day when they were taking Victorian photos
00:20:27,00:20:29,"and kids because of the exposure time,"
00:20:29,00:20:31,"you'd have to take a photo, take one and a half minutes."
00:20:31,00:20:33,Parents would dress up as the sofa
00:20:33,00:20:35,and hold the kids on their legs
00:20:35,00:20:38,so that the kid would stay there for the minute and a half.
00:20:38,00:20:39,It took to do it.
00:20:39,00:20:41,Like we've got a whole history of dressing up
00:20:41,00:20:46,"as sofas to do it, advance our species."
00:20:46,00:20:47,- Do you say advance?
00:20:47,00:20:47,- Yeah.
00:20:47,00:20:48,- Advance our species.
00:20:48,00:20:49,"- Oh, advance, yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:20:49,00:20:52,"- I actually wanna, I've got to be in my bonnet about that"
00:20:52,00:20:54,"since you've raised it, which you have."
00:20:54,00:20:55,- J.D. Vance.
00:20:55,00:20:57,- J.D. Vance.
00:20:57,00:20:58,"I was told, 'cause I'm not on social media"
00:20:58,00:21:01,and so I don't pick up on sort of the news.
00:21:01,00:21:03,"When I pick up on the real news, it's not on social media"
00:21:03,00:21:06,but not the crap news that the rest of you read.
00:21:06,00:21:10,And you guys told me he had sex with a sofa.
00:21:11,00:21:15,"- J.D. Vance, for future lists of the podcast is..."
00:21:15,00:21:17,- What's the president?
00:21:17,00:21:20,(audience laughing)
00:21:20,00:21:22,"- But who'd have thought that first lady,"
00:21:22,00:21:25,the enormous sofa that came to the White House with a...
00:21:25,00:21:28,(audience laughing)
00:21:28,00:21:30,"- Yeah, Travis surrounding me."
00:21:30,00:21:31,"Someone just made it up on Twitter,"
00:21:31,00:21:34,the idea that he'd had sex with a sofa.
00:21:34,00:21:35,- I see it's fake.
00:21:35,00:21:35,- It's completely fake.
00:21:35,00:21:36,"- It's pure fake, it's pure fake."
00:21:36,00:21:38,It could have been one of your facts then.
00:21:38,00:21:40,There's not a grain of truth in it.
00:21:40,00:21:41,"No, it is, it's not fake."
00:21:41,00:21:44,"It's really not, yeah, it's genuinely nonsense."
00:21:44,00:21:47,- And now people feel they need to be referencing it.
00:21:47,00:21:48,What's happened to American debate?
00:21:48,00:21:51,"Walt said, running mate of..."
00:21:51,00:21:53,"- Oh, he used to be the leader of the resistance, yes."
00:21:53,00:21:54,(audience laughing)
00:21:54,00:21:56,- I can't wait to debate this guy.
00:21:56,00:21:59,"That is, if he's willing to get off the couch and show up."
00:21:59,00:21:59,I mean...
00:21:59,00:22:01,"- Yeah, it was a bit weird."
00:22:01,00:22:03,"- It's all gone a bit weird, hasn't it?"
00:22:03,00:22:06,"- Here's the thing, to get a bit political,"
00:22:06,00:22:08,which is the most English way of saying
00:22:08,00:22:12,"that item of furniture, sofa, couch, or seti?"
00:22:12,00:22:13,- What's the most English way of saying it?
00:22:13,00:22:14,- Yeah.
00:22:14,00:22:17,"- Okay, so couch is, I think, from French Couché."
00:22:17,00:22:18,"So that's not a... - Good, very good."
00:22:18,00:22:20,"- Okay, so what's left, couch and seti?"
00:22:20,00:22:22,"- Sofa, seti. - Sorry, sofa and seti."
00:22:22,00:22:26,"- Sofa, did I read that one from Arabic?"
00:22:26,00:22:27,- Very good.
00:22:27,00:22:28,- I shouldn't ask these questions to people
00:22:28,00:22:30,"who've just spent a day researching sofas,"
00:22:30,00:22:31,should I really?
00:22:31,00:22:35,"- I think, yes, I think it's on the sofa in Arabic."
00:22:35,00:22:37,"- Yeah, but I actually don't know what seti is from, so..."
00:22:37,00:22:39,"- It's from the old English setam,"
00:22:39,00:22:42,"meaning to sit down, like, to set something down."
00:22:42,00:22:43,- So that's properly old English?
00:22:43,00:22:45,"- So if you want to speak proper old English,"
00:22:45,00:22:46,"I think there are different, like,"
00:22:46,00:22:50,sofas have different arms and stuff like that these days.
00:22:50,00:22:51,"Do you know what, in France,"
00:22:51,00:22:52,they call one of those sofas
00:22:52,00:22:54,"that has just one arm at the back of it,"
00:22:54,00:22:56,and you kind of lie on it.
00:22:56,00:22:57,- I think that is a chaise longue.
00:22:57,00:23:01,"- No, they call it a meridienne in France, a chaise longue."
00:23:01,00:23:03,"If they're talking about a chaise longue,"
00:23:03,00:23:06,they're referring to a deque chair.
00:23:06,00:23:07,- Isn't that interesting? - Isn't it really?
00:23:07,00:23:08,- Yeah.
00:23:08,00:23:10,- French for deque chair is chaise longue.
00:23:10,00:23:12,- A genuine murmur of shock and dismay went through the roof of that.
00:23:12,00:23:14,That's really interesting.
00:23:14,00:23:17,"- What is a deque chair, if not a chaise longue"
00:23:17,00:23:19,"with all the cushions ripped off and put outside, I suppose?"
00:23:19,00:23:20,- Exactly.
00:23:20,00:23:21,"- Yeah, you just see where they're coming from."
00:23:21,00:23:24,"- I'm very one of those Chinese civil service exams,"
00:23:24,00:23:25,with musings like that.
00:23:25,00:23:27,Do you want to hear some sofa slang?
00:23:27,00:23:28,- Yeah.
00:23:28,00:23:30,- What is a sofa pounder?
00:23:30,00:23:31,"- We're not back on chaisee pants, you know."
00:23:31,00:23:34,"- No, come on."
00:23:34,00:23:36,Grow up.
00:23:36,00:23:40,"- Is it a burger, but the buns look like sofas?"
00:23:40,00:23:41,- That's really good.
00:23:41,00:23:43,"- Oh, is it when you do, is it that cushion process"
00:23:43,00:23:47,where you do the judo chop to make the sofa plump up?
00:23:47,00:23:48,Do you know what I mean?
00:23:48,00:23:49,- Yeah.
00:23:49,00:23:50,- That's a sofa pounder.
00:23:50,00:23:52,"No, it's just an observer or a non-participant."
00:23:52,00:23:53,You're just sitting on the sofa.
00:23:53,00:23:57,What is to couch a porker?
00:23:57,00:24:00,"- Again, guys."
00:24:00,00:24:01,"- Did you have all this before, Anna told you"
00:24:01,00:24:04,that JD Vance didn't do this.
00:24:04,00:24:06,"- It's wasted research, so I'm just reading it out."
00:24:06,00:24:09,"- So couch a porker, something to do with pig farming?"
00:24:09,00:24:10,- No.
00:24:10,00:24:11,- Is there something to do with lyes?
00:24:11,00:24:13,- It's to just lie down and have a nap.
00:24:13,00:24:15,"- Well, a different kind of lie, actually, but okay."
00:24:15,00:24:18,- And what is couch hockey for one?
00:24:18,00:24:21,(audience laughing)
00:24:21,00:24:22,- That one is rude.
00:24:22,00:24:25,"- Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, that one is rude."
00:24:25,00:24:27,(upbeat music)
00:24:29,00:24:33,"- It is time for fact number three, and that is my fact."
00:24:33,00:24:35,My fact this week is that the mathematician
00:24:35,00:24:39,who developed GPS didn't make it to the job interview
00:24:39,00:24:41,where she'd later developed GPS
00:24:41,00:24:45,because she couldn't work out the directions to get there.
00:24:45,00:24:47,"- Ah, 'cause you haven't invented GPS yet."
00:24:47,00:24:49,"- Yeah, exactly, yeah."
00:24:49,00:24:53,"This is an amazing woman, so Gladys West."
00:24:53,00:24:54,- Gladys?
00:24:54,00:24:57,"- I think it's just, it's spelled with a Y,"
00:24:57,00:24:58,but I think it's just Gladys.
00:24:58,00:25:00,"So Gladys West, yeah."
00:25:00,00:25:02,- Are you saying the woman who invented GPS
00:25:02,00:25:03,has West in her name?
00:25:03,00:25:04,- Isn't that amazing?
00:25:04,00:25:04,- That's crackers.
00:25:04,00:25:06,"- Yeah, yeah, so she's a co-developer"
00:25:06,00:25:08,and she is an incredible woman.
00:25:08,00:25:11,"She's still alive, she's in her 90s"
00:25:11,00:25:14,and she believed for numbers of reasons
00:25:14,00:25:16,"that she shouldn't go to this job interview,"
00:25:16,00:25:18,"which was offered to her, which was with the Navy"
00:25:18,00:25:20,in America and she was an African-American.
00:25:20,00:25:21,She thought they're not gonna give me a job.
00:25:21,00:25:24,No women like me are given any kind of job.
00:25:24,00:25:26,There's only four people of color within the company as is.
00:25:26,00:25:28,Why would they give it to me?
00:25:28,00:25:30,"I can't actually find it on a map,"
00:25:30,00:25:33,so I don't know where I'm going even to get there.
00:25:33,00:25:37,And I just don't do job interviews 'cause I'm that good.
00:25:37,00:25:39,"So she didn't go for the job interview,"
00:25:39,00:25:42,but then they did end up chasing after her
00:25:42,00:25:43,and giving her the job.
00:25:43,00:25:45,"And then many years later, through lots of developments,"
00:25:45,00:25:47,she created what was the framework
00:25:47,00:25:50,of what then became GPS.
00:25:50,00:25:52,"And so even then, after she invented this"
00:25:52,00:25:55,"or helped to invent this life-changing thing,"
00:25:55,00:25:56,she still never used it
00:25:56,00:25:57,'cause she just preferred road maps.
00:25:57,00:25:58,(laughing)
00:25:58,00:25:59,"And I think, is this right?"
00:25:59,00:26:01,'Cause this is just from what I read.
00:26:01,00:26:03,"But if GPS is like satellites,"
00:26:03,00:26:06,"it tells you where you are by things about snow satellites,"
00:26:06,00:26:09,but they need to know the shape of the Earth.
00:26:09,00:26:10,And the Earth is not just--
00:26:10,00:26:11,- Round.
00:26:11,00:26:12,"- There you go, Gladys."
00:26:12,00:26:14,"- Oh, well, well, well, well."
00:26:14,00:26:16,- It is a rocky era.
00:26:16,00:26:18,"It's not round, that's the whole point."
00:26:18,00:26:19,"I mean, we know that it's a spheroid,"
00:26:19,00:26:21,"it's thicker at the equator,"
00:26:21,00:26:24,but also there's lumps and bumps and tidal poles
00:26:24,00:26:26,and all that kind of stuff.
00:26:26,00:26:28,And she worked out the algorithms that account
00:26:28,00:26:30,for all of these little bumps on the Earth.
00:26:30,00:26:31,- Yeah. - Yeah.
00:26:31,00:26:32,- And she did amazing things.
00:26:32,00:26:34,Like she was one of the people to determine
00:26:34,00:26:37,the movement of Pluto in relation to Neptune.
00:26:37,00:26:38,Amazing person.
00:26:38,00:26:41,"By the way, Neptune was discovered by a couch."
00:26:41,00:26:43,"- Well, yeah. - Go on."
00:26:43,00:26:46,"- I said, John Couch Adams."
00:26:46,00:26:48,He was a British mathematician and astronomer.
00:26:48,00:26:49,"Yeah, and he--"
00:26:49,00:26:52,- I only referred him as John Sofa Adams.
00:26:52,00:26:55,"- That's from the Arabic, he's John Sati Adams, actually."
00:26:55,00:26:59,- I sort of vaguely knew that GPS was a military thing.
00:26:59,00:27:02,Or like an American Department of Defense
00:27:02,00:27:02,sort of something thing.
00:27:02,00:27:03,But I had no idea.
00:27:03,00:27:07,"It was really like, it's properly, it's still run by,"
00:27:07,00:27:08,do you know who runs it these days?
00:27:08,00:27:10,- Space Force.
00:27:10,00:27:11,- Oh. - Space Force.
00:27:11,00:27:12,It's been handed over to them.
00:27:12,00:27:15,They're very new and they've got control of GPS now.
00:27:15,00:27:17,- Are they under the auspices of the US still
00:27:17,00:27:18,or has it been globalized?
00:27:18,00:27:19,- Space Force has not been spun out.
00:27:19,00:27:20,"It's still, yeah, yeah."
00:27:20,00:27:21,- It's still America. - It's America.
00:27:21,00:27:23,"- America. - Oh, the US government."
00:27:23,00:27:24,"- Yeah, it's US government."
00:27:24,00:27:27,- The master control station is in Colorado.
00:27:27,00:27:29,And they're really young as well.
00:27:29,00:27:31,"The average age of the, I don't know if they're called conductors."
00:27:31,00:27:33,They can't be called conductors.
00:27:33,00:27:34,"Like, ding, ding, ding."
00:27:34,00:27:37,Everyone aboard the Space Force.
00:27:37,00:27:37,All aboard.
00:27:37,00:27:40,That's good.
00:27:40,00:27:43,"No, but their average age is 23."
00:27:43,00:27:44,It's very heavy response.
00:27:44,00:27:45,"- Wow. - That's, I know."
00:27:45,00:27:46,"- Oh my God. - No, I can't trust that."
00:27:46,00:27:47,- I know.
00:27:47,00:27:48,- But it's-- - But it was--
00:27:48,00:27:50,"- Hang on, like NASA, the Apollo missions,"
00:27:50,00:27:53,everyone in mission control were youngins.
00:27:53,00:27:55,They were all late teens. - Were they 23?
00:27:55,00:27:56,"- That's true. - Yeah, yeah, they were all,"
00:27:56,00:27:58,they were all late teens.
00:27:58,00:28:01,- Give us a cheer if you're older than 23 in the audience.
00:28:01,00:28:02,(audience cheering)
00:28:02,00:28:03,- Nice.
00:28:03,00:28:06,Do we dare ask the following question?
00:28:06,00:28:08,Give us a cheer if you're under 23?
00:28:08,00:28:11,"- Yeah. - Well, don't be ashamed."
00:28:11,00:28:14,- We've got an audience of people
00:28:14,00:28:17,who are too old to be in NASA.
00:28:17,00:28:19,I think that's what we've discovered.
00:28:19,00:28:20,"- But the aim of it, according to Brad Parkinson,"
00:28:20,00:28:22,it was also one of the guys named
00:28:22,00:28:23,the father of GPS.
00:28:23,00:28:25,"I mean, all sorts of people are given titles about it,"
00:28:25,00:28:26,but he was very important.
00:28:26,00:28:30,The mission was to drop five bombs in the same hole.
00:28:30,00:28:32,"- Wow. - Wow, that is--"
00:28:32,00:28:34,- Why do you want to drop five bombs in the same hole?
00:28:34,00:28:38,"- In case, I think he was in a high-falutin' way"
00:28:38,00:28:39,trying to say we need accuracy
00:28:39,00:28:41,in terms of where we're dropping our lethal bombs.
00:28:41,00:28:42,"- Oh, I see."
00:28:42,00:28:45,- I don't think there was a particularly dangerous hole
00:28:45,00:28:47,that they needed to subdue.
00:28:47,00:28:49,- We've got to destroy that hole every time we hit it.
00:28:49,00:28:50,It just gets bigger.
00:28:50,00:28:52,(laughing)
00:28:52,00:28:57,"- There was a worry, wasn't there,"
00:28:57,00:29:00,that UK Trident Missiles used GPS
00:29:00,00:29:02,because GPS is an American military thing.
00:29:02,00:29:04,"And if we were to go to war with America,"
00:29:04,00:29:06,all they'd have to do is turn off the GPS
00:29:06,00:29:08,and our missiles wouldn't be able to hit anywhere.
00:29:08,00:29:09,- Right.
00:29:09,00:29:10,- But I believe that isn't true
00:29:10,00:29:13,because I was reading about how Trident Missiles
00:29:13,00:29:14,find their way to places.
00:29:14,00:29:15,And this is amazing.
00:29:15,00:29:17,They use stellar sighting.
00:29:17,00:29:18,- What's that mean?
00:29:18,00:29:19,- They look at the stars.
00:29:19,00:29:20,- What?
00:29:20,00:29:21,- Isn't that amazing? - That's incredible.
00:29:21,00:29:26,"- Even at daytime, they can lock onto 11 stars."
00:29:26,00:29:27,- I guess it is. - Isn't that insane?
00:29:27,00:29:28,- I've got an app. - That's amazing.
00:29:28,00:29:29,- I've got an app where you can see
00:29:29,00:29:32,where the stars are even in daytime and that.
00:29:32,00:29:34,"So, yeah, it's actually less impressive"
00:29:34,00:29:35,when you know that they actually know
00:29:35,00:29:37,where they are and it's not through vision.
00:29:37,00:29:38,"- Yeah, but you're a person."
00:29:38,00:29:39,This is a piece of rock.
00:29:39,00:29:40,"It's a bit of rock, though."
00:29:40,00:29:43,(laughing)
00:29:43,00:29:44,"Look, it's Trident, all right?"
00:29:44,00:29:45,It's probably gonna be a bit old.
00:29:45,00:29:48,But that's unbelievable.
00:29:48,00:29:51,"'Cause you don't want, if you've got your missiles,"
00:29:51,00:29:53,"you don't want them to rely on this technology,"
00:29:53,00:29:56,which could be knocked out by someone else's Space Force.
00:29:56,00:29:58,- Yeah. - Wow.
00:29:58,00:30:01,"- Mind you, using 11, why do you need to use so many?"
00:30:01,00:30:04,"'Cause GPS, we use four."
00:30:04,00:30:06,"- Four what? - Four satellites, sorry."
00:30:06,00:30:08,"So when we're navigating by GPS,"
00:30:08,00:30:10,"it means that the receiver in your car,"
00:30:10,00:30:13,that's receiving signals from four satellites.
00:30:13,00:30:15,"But I spent, I must have wasted four hours"
00:30:15,00:30:17,working out why the fourth one exists.
00:30:17,00:30:20,"So three of them are to, basically,"
00:30:20,00:30:22,you work out how far you are from one satellite.
00:30:22,00:30:24,Then there's like a radius drawn around that
00:30:24,00:30:25,and you could be anywhere on that line.
00:30:25,00:30:27,And then you work out how far you are from a second
00:30:27,00:30:30,and that gives you two possible positions you could be in.
00:30:30,00:30:32,And then you work out how far you are from a third
00:30:32,00:30:33,and that tells you where you are.
00:30:33,00:30:34,- 'Cause that pinpoints you.
00:30:34,00:30:36,"- Exactly, that pinpoints you."
00:30:36,00:30:37,And then there's a fourth one.
00:30:37,00:30:39,- Time. - And it's time.
00:30:39,00:30:40,"Exactly, it's time."
00:30:40,00:30:41,- The fourth dimension.
00:30:41,00:30:43,We know where the suspect is.
00:30:43,00:30:45,(laughing)
00:30:45,00:30:47,- What about if we got there before it was a hole?
00:30:47,00:30:50,(laughing)
00:30:50,00:30:54,- And that's why GPS so often makes you late.
00:30:54,00:30:54,"- So what is it, Anna?"
00:30:54,00:30:55,What is it?
00:30:55,00:30:56,- It is time.
00:30:56,00:31:01,"Basically, it's the fact that the clock in your Garmin"
00:31:01,00:31:03,"is shit, whereas the clock in all satellites"
00:31:03,00:31:04,is an atomic clock.
00:31:04,00:31:06,They've in fact got four in case the first three cock up.
00:31:06,00:31:08,And so the fourth satellite is sort of acting
00:31:08,00:31:09,like a substitute clock.
00:31:09,00:31:11,- So I'm sure you're right.
00:31:11,00:31:13,"I thought I had found out something different,"
00:31:13,00:31:14,which is that it's your elevation.
00:31:14,00:31:17,"It also is that, that's a complicated thing."
00:31:17,00:31:18,- Okay.
00:31:18,00:31:20,"- Because the Earth, it's all spheres."
00:31:20,00:31:23,"So actually, I think the other thing is that..."
00:31:23,00:31:24,- It's all spheres.
00:31:24,00:31:25,Discuss.
00:31:25,00:31:28,Welcome to the Chinese civil service exams.
00:31:28,00:31:29,(laughing)
00:31:29,00:31:31,- Let me just check my pants.
00:31:31,00:31:33,(laughing)
00:31:33,00:31:35,"- I know this, it's on my gusset, I'm sure of it."
00:31:35,00:31:38,"- No, no, guys, please."
00:31:38,00:31:39,- That's so confused.
00:31:39,00:31:40,- Yeah.
00:31:40,00:31:43,- Why does GPS get it wrong sometimes then?
00:31:43,00:31:44,"There's a whole Wikipedia article,"
00:31:44,00:31:46,"I saw called ""Death by GPS."""
00:31:46,00:31:47,"- Okay, that is human error."
00:31:47,00:31:49,"That is people following GPS when they shouldn't be,"
00:31:49,00:31:51,when they can see there's a road in front of them
00:31:51,00:31:53,and the GPS has made an error about the terrain.
00:31:53,00:31:55,"But that's more like a mapping error,"
00:31:55,00:31:56,as far as I understand it.
00:31:56,00:31:57,- Okay.
00:31:57,00:31:58,"- But there is a thing where in the early days of GPS,"
00:31:58,00:31:59,"you could either have good GPS,"
00:31:59,00:32:01,"which the American government had,"
00:32:01,00:32:02,"or you could have crap GPS,"
00:32:02,00:32:04,"which the rest of the world had,"
00:32:04,00:32:05,apart from a few select allies.
00:32:05,00:32:07,"And there was, it was called either,"
00:32:07,00:32:08,what was it called?
00:32:08,00:32:10,"Standard positioning service, crap GPS,"
00:32:10,00:32:12,or GPS premium.
00:32:12,00:32:13,(laughing)
00:32:13,00:32:15,- Where you have to be an ally of a map.
00:32:15,00:32:19,"- Club GPS, but just $3.99 a month,"
00:32:19,00:32:20,(laughing)
00:32:20,00:32:22,"will give you loads of extra content,"
00:32:22,00:32:24,will give you more suspects to target.
00:32:24,00:32:25,(laughing)
00:32:25,00:32:29,"Yeah, but it was because they didn't want hostile nations,"
00:32:29,00:32:31,having access to the kind of pinpoint accuracy
00:32:31,00:32:32,that the US government had.
00:32:32,00:32:35,- I'm suddenly picturing me and my wife in a car
00:32:35,00:32:36,"taking the wrong turn,"
00:32:36,00:32:38,"pummeling straight off the edge of a cliff,"
00:32:38,00:32:41,"and our last words being, should've gone premium."
00:32:41,00:32:43,(laughing)
00:32:43,00:32:47,Can I tell you about a GPS service from 1916?
00:32:47,00:32:48,"- Oh yeah, wow."
00:32:48,00:32:50,"- It was a Manhattan chauffeur called George Boyden,"
00:32:50,00:32:53,and he painted this new technique.
00:32:53,00:32:56,"And what it was, there would be a phonograph in your car,"
00:32:56,00:33:00,"and it would play recordings, say turn left now,"
00:33:00,00:33:02,"or turn right, or go straight on."
00:33:02,00:33:05,And it would be attached to your wheels.
00:33:05,00:33:08,"And after you've got a certain distance,"
00:33:08,00:33:11,it would know to play turn left now.
00:33:11,00:33:11,Isn't that clever?
00:33:11,00:33:13,- That's incredible.
00:33:13,00:33:15,"- Well, obviously the problem is, if you miss one turning."
00:33:15,00:33:18,(laughing)
00:33:18,00:33:20,(upbeat music)
00:33:20,00:33:26,"- We need to move on to our final fact of the show,"
00:33:26,00:33:27,and that is James.
00:33:27,00:33:28,"- Okay, my fact this week,"
00:33:28,00:33:31,is that playing ice hockey can make you talk
00:33:31,00:33:32,in a Canadian accent.
00:33:32,00:33:35,(laughing)
00:33:35,00:33:37,"- So, okay, so this is,"
00:33:37,00:33:39,"you don't even need to be around Canadians,"
00:33:39,00:33:41,"you just are, you've picked up your--"
00:33:41,00:33:43,- You don't need to be a boot them.
00:33:43,00:33:44,(laughing)
00:33:44,00:33:46,"- God, that was a crowbar again."
00:33:46,00:33:47,"- That's literally the only word,"
00:33:47,00:33:49,"like we've said this before, we came on stage early,"
00:33:49,00:33:52,I can't say any Canadian sounding words.
00:33:52,00:33:54,"- I think a boot is the only one anyone can,"
00:33:54,00:33:55,"and you've hogged it now, so."
00:33:55,00:33:58,"- All right, so this is a linguist"
00:33:58,00:34:01,"at the University of Rochester called Andrew Bray,"
00:34:01,00:34:03,and he started out by studying the evolution
00:34:03,00:34:07,"of hockey jargon, and then whenever he told anyone"
00:34:07,00:34:09,"about the project, they kept saying to him,"
00:34:09,00:34:11,"""Well, why don't you actually look at why American"
00:34:11,00:34:14,"""hockey players start sounding like fake Canadians?"""
00:34:14,00:34:17,"And he decided, ""Yeah, why not, let's do that."
00:34:17,00:34:19,"""Everyone's asking it, I might as well."""
00:34:19,00:34:22,"And so he's interviewed a lot of people,"
00:34:22,00:34:24,"interviewed a lot of Americans, a lot of Canadians,"
00:34:24,00:34:29,"and he found that up until about the age of 14,"
00:34:29,00:34:31,"if you're American, you don't really sound that Canadian,"
00:34:31,00:34:33,"but from then on, you really do start sounding"
00:34:33,00:34:36,"more and more Canadian, and what he reckons is,"
00:34:36,00:34:40,"you pick up hockey terms, like ice hockey slang,"
00:34:40,00:34:41,"and you say that in a Canadian way,"
00:34:41,00:34:43,"because that's what all your peers are saying,"
00:34:43,00:34:47,and it kind of seeps into the rest of your vocabulary.
00:34:47,00:34:50,"- What a Canadian, I'm thinking, Zamboni."
00:34:50,00:34:52,"- Oh, that's interesting, I think that was American,"
00:34:52,00:34:56,"actually, but there was, let's say, for instance,"
00:34:56,00:34:58,"a hockey arena is known as a barn,"
00:34:58,00:35:02,and a puck is known as a biscuit in Canadian terms.
00:35:02,00:35:04,"- Okay, and then the accent sort of follows along"
00:35:04,00:35:05,after the words.
00:35:05,00:35:06,"- Yeah, you pick up the odd word,"
00:35:06,00:35:08,"and you say the odd word in that accent,"
00:35:08,00:35:09,and then slowly you just start saying
00:35:09,00:35:10,more and more in that accent.
00:35:10,00:35:12,"- God, we're so impressionable,"
00:35:12,00:35:14,"it's embarrassing, isn't it?"
00:35:14,00:35:15,- That's not about roles.
00:35:15,00:35:19,"You know, Gary Oldman, one of the most famous actors"
00:35:19,00:35:21,"from Britain, he went over to America,"
00:35:21,00:35:23,and he does a lot of movies where he speaks
00:35:23,00:35:25,"in an English, sorry, in an American accent."
00:35:25,00:35:29,"When he moved back here, he had to have a language coach,"
00:35:29,00:35:31,"and an accent coach, basically--"
00:35:31,00:35:32,- Language coach?
00:35:32,00:35:33,What actor is that?
00:35:33,00:35:35,- That's Canadian.
00:35:35,00:35:38,Authentic.
00:35:38,00:35:39,Wobbeck.
00:35:39,00:35:45,"So, yeah, he had to have someone to re-teach him."
00:35:45,00:35:46,- Re-teach him his accent.
00:35:46,00:35:50,"- In Canadian English, there are interesting vowel shifts"
00:35:50,00:35:51,"that they do, and I had never heard of any of this,"
00:35:51,00:35:56,"but there's a boot, which they don't actually say a boot."
00:35:56,00:35:58,"If you listen to them closely, they say the,"
00:35:58,00:36:00,"okay, I'm gonna try and explain this."
00:36:00,00:36:05,"When you say the about, ow, is too sound, right?"
00:36:05,00:36:07,"It's ah, and then ooh."
00:36:07,00:36:07,- Ow.
00:36:07,00:36:09,- About.
00:36:09,00:36:10,"That's it, slow down."
00:36:10,00:36:12,- Right.
00:36:12,00:36:16,"- What's that all about, and then ooh, right?"
00:36:16,00:36:16,- Yeah.
00:36:16,00:36:19,"- All right, Professor Higgins, move us on."
00:36:19,00:36:22,"- But in Canada, the diphthong, which is that bit of it,"
00:36:22,00:36:25,it starts with an exclusively Canadian sound
00:36:25,00:36:27,"that not only can most people not say,"
00:36:27,00:36:29,you can't even write it down in the--
00:36:29,00:36:30,- Can you say it?
00:36:30,00:36:31,- Well--
00:36:31,00:36:32,- Can you try?
00:36:32,00:36:34,"- Starts with something like air,"
00:36:34,00:36:35,"and it moves to something like ooh,"
00:36:35,00:36:37,but it's not a boat or a boot.
00:36:37,00:36:38,- It's ow.
00:36:38,00:36:40,"- Well, exactly."
00:36:40,00:36:41,- Do you know that King Charles
00:36:41,00:36:42,is gonna start talking like Mr. T?
00:36:42,00:36:45,- Mr. T?
00:36:45,00:36:46,- What?
00:36:46,00:36:47,- When?
00:36:47,00:36:50,"- Sometime in the future, this was a paper I was reading"
00:36:50,00:36:53,"about something called the intrusive L,"
00:36:53,00:36:56,"and it's the fact that people often drop their Ls,"
00:36:56,00:36:59,"so Mr. T might say, I pity the fool."
00:36:59,00:37:00,- Yeah.
00:37:00,00:37:02,"- They kind of hear the L, but he doesn't actually say it."
00:37:02,00:37:03,- I pity the fool.
00:37:03,00:37:04,"- There's a few of things like people might say,"
00:37:04,00:37:05,"cool, cool, cool, cool."
00:37:05,00:37:07,"But they don't actually say the L,"
00:37:07,00:37:08,"they're just saying, ooh, really."
00:37:08,00:37:09,"- Oh, right."
00:37:09,00:37:10,- If you say--
00:37:10,00:37:11,"- Like, fool fighters, right?"
00:37:11,00:37:14,"That's, we call them, we call them."
00:37:14,00:37:15,(laughing)
00:37:15,00:37:18,"- Yeah, or I'm just, I'm going to the zoo today."
00:37:18,00:37:19,- Yeah.
00:37:19,00:37:20,(laughing)
00:37:20,00:37:22,"- You know what, it's really interesting about that."
00:37:22,00:37:24,"So apparently, according to the paper that I said,"
00:37:24,00:37:26,"it's basically an unstoppable trend,"
00:37:26,00:37:28,and even the British royal family
00:37:28,00:37:30,is eventually going to speak like that.
00:37:30,00:37:33,"But the really interesting thing is in Bristol,"
00:37:33,00:37:36,"they add an L, and they kind of overcompensate,"
00:37:36,00:37:37,they over-correct.
00:37:37,00:37:39,"They know that people often drop their Ls,"
00:37:39,00:37:42,and so they'll add Ls where they shouldn't really be one.
00:37:42,00:37:45,"And so there are some people in Bristol,"
00:37:45,00:37:47,"mostly older people, who might, instead of saying idea,"
00:37:47,00:37:51,"they'll say ideal, or they might say, instead of piano,"
00:37:51,00:37:52,they say piano.
00:37:52,00:37:52,- Piano.
00:37:52,00:37:54,"- It's not exactly a full L,"
00:37:54,00:37:55,but it's kind of a slight L on it.
00:37:55,00:37:58,"- And your logic is that they're trying to,"
00:37:58,00:38:00,"like there are lots of homeless Ls now,"
00:38:00,00:38:01,"that have been dropped of other people's speech,"
00:38:01,00:38:04,and the good people of Bristol are trying to re-home them.
00:38:04,00:38:06,- Are they going to be the last people
00:38:06,00:38:07,to stand against the disappearing L?
00:38:07,00:38:09,"- Well, presumably there'll be some other people"
00:38:09,00:38:11,who kind of overcompensate as well.
00:38:11,00:38:13,"But this is true, and it's so true in Bristol,"
00:38:13,00:38:17,"that the city of Bristol was originally called Brixto,"
00:38:17,00:38:21,"and the people of Bristol started saying Brixto,"
00:38:21,00:38:22,"and they added the L to Brixto,"
00:38:22,00:38:24,and that's how they got the name.
00:38:24,00:38:27,So the name of the entire city comes from this overcompensator
00:38:27,00:38:29,and adding Ls at the end of words.
00:38:29,00:38:30,- Oh my God.
00:38:30,00:38:31,- Isn't that cool?
00:38:31,00:38:33,"- Overcompensating for what, though?"
00:38:33,00:38:35,"- Yeah, all right, it's lovely, Bristol."
00:38:35,00:38:36,"- You literally just explained it,"
00:38:36,00:38:38,but it's still worth saying.
00:38:38,00:38:40,"- It's the thing that I do of adding Rs,"
00:38:40,00:38:41,where they don't belong.
00:38:41,00:38:42,"- Oh, no, no."
00:38:42,00:38:43,- Americans do.
00:38:43,00:38:46,"- But no American says Chicago, which is what I say."
00:38:46,00:38:47,"- No, no, no one does."
00:38:47,00:38:50,- But you have an international accent that's sort of--
00:38:50,00:38:53,- I would say some Bristolians might say that.
00:38:53,00:38:53,- Chicago?
00:38:53,00:38:57,"- But again, not like that."
00:38:57,00:38:58,Never like that.
00:38:58,00:39:01,- It's a very different musical.
00:39:01,00:39:07,"- Yeah, she was right to shoot him, yeah."
00:39:07,00:39:10,- Name me a vowel.
00:39:10,00:39:11,Just name a vowel.
00:39:11,00:39:12,"- Oh, I can't think of any now."
00:39:12,00:39:13,- Hi.
00:39:13,00:39:14,"- Hi, brilliant, one."
00:39:14,00:39:15,- Yur.
00:39:15,00:39:18,"- You, you, I, you, okay."
00:39:18,00:39:18,- E.
00:39:18,00:39:19,- E.
00:39:19,00:39:21,"- I mean, we know the five."
00:39:21,00:39:22,- O.
00:39:22,00:39:23,- And A.
00:39:23,00:39:24,"- A, brilliant."
00:39:24,00:39:26,- Where's the sixth?
00:39:26,00:39:27,- There's a sixth one.
00:39:27,00:39:28,- Y?
00:39:28,00:39:29,"- Nope, it's not Y."
00:39:29,00:39:30,- Oh.
00:39:30,00:39:31,- Is it R?
00:39:31,00:39:32,- R.
00:39:32,00:39:37,"- Get this, R, technically, is a vowel."
00:39:37,00:39:38,It's the secret sixth vowel.
00:39:38,00:39:39,"What's a consonant, right?"
00:39:39,00:39:41,You are closing something off in your mouth.
00:39:41,00:39:43,"You're using your lips or your teeth or your tongue,"
00:39:43,00:39:45,and you are closing something off.
00:39:45,00:39:48,"F, or, someone just said, I agree, out of nowhere."
00:39:48,00:39:52,"Right, that's what a consonant is,"
00:39:52,00:39:54,"but a vowel, you're an open tube."
00:39:54,00:39:55,Your mouth is an open tube.
00:39:55,00:39:56,- Okay.
00:39:56,00:39:59,"- And you are, you're changing the shape of the tube,"
00:39:59,00:40:03,"but it's like, A, E, I, O, U."
00:40:03,00:40:05,"They're all, the tube is open,"
00:40:05,00:40:08,and R is the same.
00:40:08,00:40:08,- Right.
00:40:08,00:40:10,"What's the really cool Spanish one where they say,"
00:40:10,00:40:12,(speaking foreign language)
00:40:12,00:40:13,- That thing.
00:40:13,00:40:16,- We are wandering dangerously close.
00:40:16,00:40:18,"- Well, no, I can't do it,"
00:40:18,00:40:19,and it's so exciting every time I hit it.
00:40:19,00:40:21,"- What is, what is it?"
00:40:21,00:40:23,- You mean where they kind of lisp the lips?
00:40:23,00:40:25,"- Yeah, like, mythically."
00:40:25,00:40:26,"- There was a theory that that was,"
00:40:26,00:40:29,"that people were trying to copy a king, wasn't it?"
00:40:29,00:40:30,- Really?
00:40:30,00:40:31,- One of the kings supposedly had a lisp.
00:40:31,00:40:33,"- Every time I hear it, I just think that's such talent."
00:40:33,00:40:35,"- I think, I feel like that was a while ago,"
00:40:35,00:40:38,"but speaking of people talking in an offensive manner,"
00:40:38,00:40:42,(audience laughing)
00:40:42,00:40:43,"and speaking of fake accents,"
00:40:43,00:40:47,"in the 1800s, late 1800s, early 1900s,"
00:40:47,00:40:50,wealthier people used to throw poverty parties
00:40:50,00:40:52,and call them poverty parties.
00:40:52,00:40:54,"And the invitations would say,"
00:40:54,00:40:57,you are only allowed to wear rags and sacks
00:40:57,00:41:00,"and your worst cloth and will only be served,"
00:41:00,00:41:01,I think it was just an excuse not to serve
00:41:01,00:41:03,"expensive canapes, it was like,"
00:41:03,00:41:06,we will only serve stale bread and water.
00:41:06,00:41:10,And people would come and put on working class accents.
00:41:10,00:41:12,"So this was a fashionable thing,"
00:41:12,00:41:13,and there were lots of invitations.
00:41:13,00:41:15,"And Irish especially, it was in America."
00:41:15,00:41:19,"And so an Irish accent was seen to be quite working class,"
00:41:19,00:41:21,"full of Irish immigrants at the time,"
00:41:21,00:41:23,and posh people turned up to parties
00:41:23,00:41:26,and had to speak the whole night in an Irish accent.
00:41:26,00:41:27,- Wow.
00:41:27,00:41:29,- That's a full party of canceled people.
00:41:29,00:41:29,"- Yeah, that's amazing."
00:41:29,00:41:30,- Right there.
00:41:30,00:41:31,- That is weird.
00:41:31,00:41:32,- Yeah.
00:41:32,00:41:33,"- Garcia, Garcia."
00:41:33,00:41:34,- You've been letting him.
00:41:34,00:41:36,(audience laughing)
00:41:36,00:41:39,"- Your invoice in the post, Dan, you're already in."
00:41:39,00:41:40,- Do you know somewhere where you can be killed
00:41:40,00:41:42,for doing the wrong accent?
00:41:42,00:41:43,- The dance chair.
00:41:43,00:41:46,(audience laughing)
00:41:46,00:41:49,- This is the ant nest beetle.
00:41:49,00:41:52,And it is a beetle that goes into ants nests
00:41:52,00:41:56,and is able to mimic the ants chemical signatures.
00:41:56,00:41:59,But it's able to do lots of different ones.
00:41:59,00:42:01,And so if you're an ant that lives over here
00:42:01,00:42:02,"or one that lives over here,"
00:42:02,00:42:03,"or maybe another species of ant,"
00:42:03,00:42:05,"it can change it very, very slightly."
00:42:05,00:42:08,So it gets all the different dialects of ant.
00:42:08,00:42:10,"And if it gets it even slightly wrong,"
00:42:10,00:42:12,the ants will kill them and eat them.
00:42:12,00:42:13,- Really?
00:42:13,00:42:14,"- Oh, that's incredible."
00:42:14,00:42:16,- Even it's just like saying tomato
00:42:16,00:42:17,instead of tomato.
00:42:17,00:42:18,- Tomato.
00:42:18,00:42:20,- So they can't get drunk at all.
00:42:20,00:42:21,- No.
00:42:21,00:42:24,- Accidentally drop a tea and that's it.
00:42:24,00:42:24,"Well, that's pretty interesting"
00:42:24,00:42:26,because there's a lot of talk
00:42:26,00:42:28,about whether animals have accents or not.
00:42:28,00:42:30,"- It's always claimed, right?"
00:42:30,00:42:32,- What the definition of an accent is.
00:42:32,00:42:35,And there was a big story that went around about cows
00:42:35,00:42:38,having regional accents a few years ago.
00:42:38,00:42:41,- Ducks as well having regional accents.
00:42:41,00:42:45,"- Well, I think that had more truth to it in 2006."
00:42:45,00:42:46,And I think we might have said this
00:42:46,00:42:47,'cause it was reported everywhere.
00:42:47,00:42:50,It was reported that cows moo in regional accents.
00:42:50,00:42:53,And it turns out that was just a big PR thing
00:42:53,00:42:56,from West Country Farmhouse Cheese Makers
00:42:56,00:42:58,- Really?
00:42:58,00:42:59,- To try and sell more cheese.
00:42:59,00:43:03,"So, and they quoted this professor, John Wells,"
00:43:03,00:43:05,"who was a professor of phonetics at UCL,"
00:43:05,00:43:08,"who kept on saying, ""I never said this."""
00:43:08,00:43:10,"These cheese guys called me and they said,"
00:43:10,00:43:12,"""Do you think cows moo in regional accents?"""
00:43:12,00:43:15,"And he said, ""I think it's incredibly unlikely."""
00:43:15,00:43:18,"And they kept on saying, ""But is it possible?"""
00:43:18,00:43:22,"And he said, ""Well, birds do exhibit regional variants."""
00:43:22,00:43:23,"Yep, we'll take that as a yes."
00:43:23,00:43:27,"- Oh my God, his career has presumably been ruined."
00:43:27,00:43:29,No one's talking to him.
00:43:29,00:43:30,None of the cows are talking to him
00:43:30,00:43:31,at any of the conferences.
00:43:31,00:43:36,Do you know what the most attractive accent is?
00:43:36,00:43:37,And this is a physiological thing.
00:43:37,00:43:38,"- Oh, okay."
00:43:38,00:43:41,- What makes your heart go pitter-patter?
00:43:41,00:43:42,"- Well, we've all got opinions."
00:43:42,00:43:43,- Wow.
00:43:43,00:43:44,- A Barcelona.
00:43:44,00:43:47,(audience laughing)
00:43:47,00:43:54,"- Yeah, that's, oh."
00:43:54,00:43:56,"- I'm feeling warm, yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:43:56,00:43:59,- Used to be an attractive accent.
00:43:59,00:44:02,"- I think this was a study of European accents,"
00:44:02,00:44:03,"in particular, done by--"
00:44:03,00:44:05,"- Most people would say French, right?"
00:44:05,00:44:05,- Most people would say French.
00:44:05,00:44:08,And this was an online language tutor called Preply.
00:44:08,00:44:10,"They attached heart rate monitors to 1,000 adults"
00:44:10,00:44:13,and they played them pre-recorded chat-up lines.
00:44:13,00:44:14,I presume the same in every language.
00:44:14,00:44:15,"- Yeah, right."
00:44:15,00:44:17,- And it found that being chatted up
00:44:17,00:44:21,in an Italian accent makes men and women's heart rates
00:44:21,00:44:22,rise by 23%.
00:44:22,00:44:23,- Really?
00:44:23,00:44:24,- 15 beats a minute higher
00:44:24,00:44:27,"if you're getting that sweet, sweet Italian telling up."
00:44:27,00:44:29,"- That's a lot of beats, actually."
00:44:29,00:44:30,- Come and stay with my mother.
00:44:30,00:44:31,- No.
00:44:31,00:44:34,(audience laughing)
00:44:34,00:44:35,- That's nice.
00:44:35,00:44:38,- So you actually ruined an entire nation for me.
00:44:38,00:44:39,(audience laughing)
00:44:39,00:44:40,- I am.
00:44:40,00:44:41,- I'm gonna need to move a song.
00:44:41,00:44:41,- What?
00:44:41,00:44:42,"- Yeah, I'm afraid."
00:44:42,00:44:43,- You're done.
00:44:43,00:44:44,"- English is the least sexy, sorry."
00:44:44,00:44:45,- Okay.
00:44:45,00:44:46,(audience laughing)
00:44:46,00:44:47,"- Well, come and see my mother."
00:44:47,00:44:49,(audience laughing)
00:44:49,00:44:52,(audience clapping)
00:44:52,00:44:57,(upbeat music)
00:44:57,00:45:01,"- All right, listen, we need to wrap up our show."
00:45:01,00:45:03,"Okay, that is it."
00:45:03,00:45:04,That is all of our facts.
