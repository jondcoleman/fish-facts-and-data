1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,080
 (upbeat music)

2
00:00:03,080 --> 00:00:04,680
 - Hi everyone, welcome to this week's episode

3
00:00:04,680 --> 00:00:06,240
 of "No such thing as a fish,"

4
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:09,160
 which we recorded at the Underbelly Theatre

5
00:00:09,160 --> 00:00:11,400
 in London's Soho.

6
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:16,400
 It was the first try at our brand new touring show,

7
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:19,400
 but we did a full podcast in the middle of that show.

8
00:00:19,400 --> 00:00:21,720
 If you would like to see all of the other bits and bobs

9
00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:23,000
 that we will do on tour,

10
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,080
 then you'll have to go and get tickets,

11
00:00:25,080 --> 00:00:29,480
 and you can get those at nosagethingsafish.com/live.

12
00:00:29,480 --> 00:00:31,640
 At this place, you can also learn

13
00:00:31,640 --> 00:00:34,520
 about our upcoming trip to Gothenburg.

14
00:00:34,520 --> 00:00:37,200
 We will be playing the Gothenburg Book Festival

15
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:39,760
 on the 27th of September.

16
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:42,280
 That will be a simple podcast recording,

17
00:00:42,280 --> 00:00:44,840
 but if you want to see all the other bells and whistles,

18
00:00:44,840 --> 00:00:48,360
 including quizzes and special guests,

19
00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:50,440
 and Andy probably talking nonsense

20
00:00:50,440 --> 00:00:52,400
 about a very obscure subject,

21
00:00:52,400 --> 00:00:54,640
 then you will have to come to one of our other shows

22
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:57,720
 in Bristol, Dublin, Glasgow, Newcastle, Cardiff, London,

23
00:00:57,720 --> 00:00:59,280
 or Manchester.

24
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:01,280
 Again, details for all of these shows

25
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:04,480
 are at nosagethingsafish.com/live.

26
00:01:04,480 --> 00:01:07,160
 We'll also do some shows in Australia and New Zealand,

27
00:01:07,160 --> 00:01:10,120
 but they are, frankly, almost all sold out.

28
00:01:10,120 --> 00:01:12,080
 If you beg, borrow, and steal,

29
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:14,120
 you might be able to find one or two tickets

30
00:01:14,120 --> 00:01:16,280
 in Perth and Christchurch.

31
00:01:16,280 --> 00:01:17,960
 I think there might be one or two

32
00:01:17,960 --> 00:01:21,520
 in our second additional show in Sydney,

33
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:22,840
 but if you are living down under,

34
00:01:22,840 --> 00:01:24,960
 then really you should try and get those tickets

35
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:25,800
 as soon as possible,

36
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:28,920
 because they are virtually sold out.

37
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:31,680
 While I'm here, it would be remiss of me not to remind you

38
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:33,600
 that we've all written lots of books.

39
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:36,680
 Anna and I have written a book called A Load of Old Balls.

40
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:39,640
 Dan has got a book called The Theory of Everything Else,

41
00:01:39,640 --> 00:01:42,840
 as well as a kids book called Impossible Things,

42
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:46,000
 and he has written novels, The Last Day, The Century,

43
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,800
 A Beginner's Guide to Breaking and Entering

44
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:49,120
 is his latest one.

45
00:01:49,120 --> 00:01:50,520
 If you're looking for something to read

46
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:52,280
 over the remaining part of summer,

47
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:55,280
 or indeed as the nights begin to draw in,

48
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:57,120
 then please do consider getting our books,

49
00:01:57,120 --> 00:01:59,760
 because it makes us, and indeed our publishers,

50
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:01,720
 very happy when you do so.

51
00:02:01,720 --> 00:02:03,880
 Anyway, enough of trying to sell you stuff.

52
00:02:03,880 --> 00:02:06,840
 The podcast is free, and of course, we'll always be free.

53
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:09,840
 And so please do enjoy this free podcast,

54
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:13,880
 recorded live at the Underbelly Theatre in Soho.

55
00:02:13,880 --> 00:02:15,720
 Okay, on with the podcast.

56
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:24,560
 - There we go.

57
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:27,160
 (upbeat music)

58
00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:34,760
 - Hello, and welcome to another episode

59
00:02:34,760 --> 00:02:37,680
 of No Such Thing as a Fish, a weekly podcast,

60
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:39,040
 this week coming to you live

61
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:41,400
 from the Underbelly Boulevard in Soho.

62
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:44,400
 (audience cheering)

63
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:48,760
 - My name is Dan Schreiber.

64
00:02:48,760 --> 00:02:50,600
 I am sitting here with Anna Tyshinski,

65
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:52,760
 Andrew Hunter Murray, and James Harkin.

66
00:02:52,760 --> 00:02:54,880
 And once again, we have gathered around the microphones

67
00:02:54,880 --> 00:02:57,560
 with our four favorite facts from the last seven days,

68
00:02:57,560 --> 00:03:00,240
 and in no particular order, here we go,

69
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:03,440
 starting with fact number one, and that is Anna.

70
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:05,960
 - My fact this week is that Chinese students

71
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:09,720
 in the 1700s could rent underwear with test answers on it

72
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:12,320
 to smuggle into exam halls.

73
00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:13,280
 - Wow.

74
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:14,720
 Do you say rent?

75
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:16,240
 (audience laughing)

76
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:18,120
 - If there are rental shops that are doing this,

77
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:19,960
 surely the schools would be aware

78
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:21,920
 that that was a thing, right?

79
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:23,600
 - I think people were aware,

80
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:26,440
 but the cheaters kept on getting smarter and smarter.

81
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:27,440
 That's the thing about cheaters.

82
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:30,440
 They can always outwit the boring law abiders.

83
00:03:30,440 --> 00:03:34,080
 This is in the civil service exams,

84
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:36,760
 very famous Chinese civil service exams,

85
00:03:36,760 --> 00:03:40,520
 by far the oldest meritocratic system in the world,

86
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:43,680
 going since the seventh century.

87
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:45,700
 This exam is extremely hard to pass,

88
00:03:45,700 --> 00:03:46,760
 but if you did pass it,

89
00:03:46,760 --> 00:03:48,400
 you could be in the Chinese civil service.

90
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:49,820
 It was very prestigious.

91
00:03:49,820 --> 00:03:53,800
 The exam's basically unchanged for 1500 years,

92
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:56,680
 and throughout the period that existed

93
00:03:56,680 --> 00:04:00,200
 from the seventh century to the start of the 20th century,

94
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:02,360
 there are these amazing stories of how people cheated.

95
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:03,200
 - I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

96
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:06,120
 If it's unchanged for 1500 years, I think I could pass.

97
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:07,800
 (audience laughing)

98
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:08,640
 - Oh yeah, Randy.

99
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:11,040
 We're looking at a picture of a shirt.

100
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:12,160
 (audience laughing)

101
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:14,040
 I would like to see you memorize that,

102
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:15,680
 even if it was in English.

103
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:19,400
 It's unbelievably tiny characters on this vest, isn't it?

104
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:20,300
 - Yeah.

105
00:04:20,300 --> 00:04:22,460
 - It is, and this is one of the cheating garments.

106
00:04:22,460 --> 00:04:24,700
 So these things were called cribbing garments.

107
00:04:24,700 --> 00:04:27,740
 And yeah, so there's evidence in the 1700s

108
00:04:27,740 --> 00:04:31,340
 of underwear made of paper with essays written on it.

109
00:04:31,340 --> 00:04:33,220
 Or, it's--

110
00:04:33,220 --> 00:04:34,980
 - Well, that says to me that what you can do

111
00:04:34,980 --> 00:04:38,180
 is just sort of remove one sheet at a time and hand it in.

112
00:04:38,180 --> 00:04:39,740
 (audience laughing)

113
00:04:39,740 --> 00:04:41,260
 - Surely you'd have to be rummaging around

114
00:04:41,260 --> 00:04:43,700
 in your undergarments to get the answers that you need,

115
00:04:43,700 --> 00:04:45,700
 'cause what you'd need is to learn a lot of Confucius.

116
00:04:45,700 --> 00:04:47,020
 That's basically what the exam is, isn't it?

117
00:04:47,020 --> 00:04:49,340
 You have to memorize 400,000 characters.

118
00:04:49,340 --> 00:04:50,220
 - Lots of learning by rote.

119
00:04:50,220 --> 00:04:51,240
 Michael Gove would have loved it.

120
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:52,080
 - Yeah.

121
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:53,480
 (audience laughing)

122
00:04:53,480 --> 00:04:54,760
 - It's just bizarre for all in the system.

123
00:04:54,760 --> 00:04:56,500
 They were so rigorous about catching cheaters.

124
00:04:56,500 --> 00:04:58,640
 They stripped, actually, they did everything,

125
00:04:58,640 --> 00:05:01,420
 but they then put you in an enclosed cubicle

126
00:05:01,420 --> 00:05:03,600
 for a few days to do the exam.

127
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:04,640
 And in that enclosed cubicle,

128
00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:06,160
 you suddenly were about your underwear,

129
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:08,160
 or the things you could actually rent

130
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:10,040
 were little scripts that you were meant to sew

131
00:05:10,040 --> 00:05:12,440
 into your underwear or into your underclothes

132
00:05:12,440 --> 00:05:13,640
 with the test answers on them,

133
00:05:13,640 --> 00:05:16,120
 but it was absolutely tiny, the writing.

134
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:18,340
 I think there was one which contained

135
00:05:18,340 --> 00:05:20,660
 722 finished compositions,

136
00:05:20,660 --> 00:05:23,340
 which was 520,000 characters,

137
00:05:23,340 --> 00:05:25,720
 and it was just in the underlining of the shirt.

138
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:27,660
 - It's because basically it was a question.

139
00:05:27,660 --> 00:05:29,420
 You knew what the question was gonna be,

140
00:05:29,420 --> 00:05:31,060
 and you knew what the answer was,

141
00:05:31,060 --> 00:05:33,020
 but the test was, can you remember the answer?

142
00:05:33,020 --> 00:05:33,860
 - Right.

143
00:05:33,860 --> 00:05:34,700
 - And it's really long.

144
00:05:34,700 --> 00:05:35,680
 - Oh, it's a pure repetition.

145
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:36,660
 - Pretty much, yeah.

146
00:05:36,660 --> 00:05:37,500
 - It's not right.

147
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:39,180
 - And those, and that tiny, tiny writing

148
00:05:39,180 --> 00:05:40,860
 is what they use today to make the labels

149
00:05:40,860 --> 00:05:43,260
 with the washing instructions that go into your--

150
00:05:43,260 --> 00:05:44,100
 - It's not so.

151
00:05:44,100 --> 00:05:44,940
 - That's true.

152
00:05:44,940 --> 00:05:45,780
 - Is it?

153
00:05:45,780 --> 00:05:48,400
 - So they locked you away for three days?

154
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:49,240
 - They did, yeah, yeah.

155
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:50,100
 - Did you do the exam?

156
00:05:50,100 --> 00:05:52,020
 - Yeah, and you were very much locked.

157
00:05:52,020 --> 00:05:53,360
 - Could you take food and drink it?

158
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:55,680
 - Yes, you bought your own little packed lunch, is?

159
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:58,340
 - Well, I would write on a sausage my answers.

160
00:05:58,340 --> 00:05:59,180
 You know?

161
00:05:59,180 --> 00:06:01,420
 - Yeah, if the evidence after, right?

162
00:06:01,420 --> 00:06:03,100
 They can find it.

163
00:06:03,100 --> 00:06:05,580
 - Why are you bringing such an enormously long sausage

164
00:06:05,580 --> 00:06:07,540
 into the exam, Andy?

165
00:06:07,540 --> 00:06:10,080
 Well, thanks for asking.

166
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:14,520
 And the room where you were, at least one of them,

167
00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:17,420
 this is the examination hall in Jiangnan,

168
00:06:17,420 --> 00:06:18,580
 you had your little room,

169
00:06:18,580 --> 00:06:19,840
 and there was lots of different rooms,

170
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:21,820
 and then there was sort of an outer corridor,

171
00:06:21,820 --> 00:06:25,180
 and then it was surrounded by walls full of thorns

172
00:06:25,180 --> 00:06:27,580
 so that no one could come in and give you the answers.

173
00:06:27,580 --> 00:06:28,900
 - Wow.

174
00:06:28,900 --> 00:06:29,740
 - That is clever.

175
00:06:29,740 --> 00:06:31,660
 - And yeah, people kept outwitting it.

176
00:06:31,660 --> 00:06:32,500
 - Yeah?

177
00:06:32,500 --> 00:06:34,380
 - No one's ever gone to such great lengths to stop cheats,

178
00:06:34,380 --> 00:06:36,220
 and it just made the cheats better and better.

179
00:06:36,220 --> 00:06:38,140
 They used the dig tunnels underneath,

180
00:06:38,140 --> 00:06:40,540
 and then deliver notes to the students.

181
00:06:40,540 --> 00:06:41,380
 - Really?

182
00:06:41,380 --> 00:06:42,500
 - You must have had to be so precise

183
00:06:42,500 --> 00:06:44,500
 to get the exact cubicle that the student was in.

184
00:06:44,500 --> 00:06:46,440
 There's tens of thousands of people.

185
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:48,440
 You just pop up in a stranger's cubicle.

186
00:06:48,440 --> 00:06:51,080
 - He's taking a shit while you're throwing up.

187
00:06:51,080 --> 00:06:53,340
 - I've actually written the answers on this shit.

188
00:06:53,340 --> 00:06:56,120
 (laughter)

189
00:06:56,120 --> 00:06:57,760
 - Well, it sounds like it hasn't changed, though, right?

190
00:06:57,760 --> 00:07:00,080
 Because modern China, I think it's still the case

191
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:02,880
 that every year around 9.1 million high school students

192
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:05,600
 are doing exams to go into university,

193
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:08,040
 and it's a nightmare getting them to the exams.

194
00:07:08,040 --> 00:07:09,320
 Like, that's one of the biggest things

195
00:07:09,320 --> 00:07:11,200
 because everyone's really on edge.

196
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:12,280
 You've got to get them from home there.

197
00:07:12,280 --> 00:07:14,740
 So, like, on days where the exams are happening,

198
00:07:14,740 --> 00:07:16,940
 there'll be very specific traffic lanes

199
00:07:16,940 --> 00:07:19,180
 that are purely for students taking exams.

200
00:07:19,180 --> 00:07:21,140
 Yeah, the families can drive them in.

201
00:07:21,140 --> 00:07:23,620
 So, it's like, yeah, exam day, this is the lane.

202
00:07:23,620 --> 00:07:25,540
 Express lane, purely for students.

203
00:07:25,540 --> 00:07:26,380
 - That's cool.

204
00:07:26,380 --> 00:07:27,220
 - Yeah.

205
00:07:27,220 --> 00:07:30,820
 - So, Dan, you grew up in Hong Kong, partly.

206
00:07:30,820 --> 00:07:32,460
 I know you weren't probably there with the edge

207
00:07:32,460 --> 00:07:33,660
 that you would have been taking these exams,

208
00:07:33,660 --> 00:07:36,580
 and you weren't trying to get into the Chinese civil service.

209
00:07:36,580 --> 00:07:37,660
 - You didn't know that?

210
00:07:37,660 --> 00:07:38,580
 - I mean, you're here now,

211
00:07:38,580 --> 00:07:40,940
 so things weren't pretty badly wrong.

212
00:07:40,940 --> 00:07:42,200
 (laughing)

213
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:43,520
 - At last.

214
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:44,340
 - Yeah.

215
00:07:44,340 --> 00:07:47,280
 (laughing)

216
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:48,720
 - That is deep cover.

217
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:51,280
 (laughing)

218
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:54,160
 - Did you ever get the advice from your parents

219
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:55,940
 of if you do badly, your mother will die

220
00:07:55,940 --> 00:07:57,280
 in a pauper's grave?

221
00:07:57,280 --> 00:07:58,680
 Did they ever say that to you?

222
00:07:58,680 --> 00:07:59,680
 - Well, my mum and dad are here.

223
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:01,920
 Did you ever say that to me?

224
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:04,080
 - No, apparently not, yeah.

225
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:06,400
 - And where has that come from, that advice?

226
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:07,240
 - Apparently, as they're saying,

227
00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:09,280
 sometimes that Chinese high schoolers

228
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:11,100
 with especially straight parents get told.

229
00:08:11,100 --> 00:08:11,940
 - Wow.

230
00:08:11,940 --> 00:08:13,100
 Do you wanna hear some of the questions

231
00:08:13,100 --> 00:08:15,700
 from modern day Chinese civil service exams?

232
00:08:15,700 --> 00:08:16,540
 - Yeah. - Wow.

233
00:08:16,540 --> 00:08:18,860
 - Actually, these are to get into

234
00:08:18,860 --> 00:08:20,300
 the next level of schooling.

235
00:08:20,300 --> 00:08:21,140
 - Okay.

236
00:08:21,140 --> 00:08:22,580
 - I like university kind of thing.

237
00:08:22,580 --> 00:08:25,020
 The containers for milk are always square boxes.

238
00:08:25,020 --> 00:08:28,180
 Containers for mineral water are always round bottles.

239
00:08:28,180 --> 00:08:31,660
 Round wine bottles are usually placed in square boxes.

240
00:08:31,660 --> 00:08:34,180
 Write a composition on the subtle philosophy

241
00:08:34,180 --> 00:08:35,800
 of round and square.

242
00:08:35,800 --> 00:08:38,060
 (laughing)

243
00:08:38,160 --> 00:08:40,640
 - Um, no, I do know this one.

244
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:43,040
 (laughing)

245
00:08:43,040 --> 00:08:44,240
 Is that a modern, that's the one one?

246
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:45,080
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

247
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:45,920
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

248
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:46,760
 - Oh, I did that one.

249
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:47,600
 - Yeah.

250
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:48,440
 (laughing)

251
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:49,600
 - Here's one.

252
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:52,820
 It flies upward and a voice asks if it is tired.

253
00:08:52,820 --> 00:08:54,560
 It says no.

254
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:55,400
 That's it.

255
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:56,240
 - I'd say it.

256
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:58,120
 Oh, I'd say it's, I'd say it's, I'd say it's.

257
00:08:58,120 --> 00:08:59,500
 - A toddler in a helicopter.

258
00:08:59,500 --> 00:09:02,000
 (laughing)

259
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,200
 - You must be tired.

260
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:04,160
 We've been out all day.

261
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:06,280
 I'm not tired, I'm not tired.

262
00:09:06,280 --> 00:09:07,560
 - Do you know the answer?

263
00:09:07,560 --> 00:09:08,400
 - No.

264
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:09,380
 - Why not?

265
00:09:09,380 --> 00:09:11,260
 - It's not a question.

266
00:09:11,260 --> 00:09:13,860
 - No, it's a prompt rather than a question, let's say.

267
00:09:13,860 --> 00:09:14,700
 - Oh, okay.

268
00:09:14,700 --> 00:09:18,220
 - Another one, comment on the civilized behavior in Beijing.

269
00:09:18,220 --> 00:09:20,780
 (laughing)

270
00:09:20,780 --> 00:09:22,320
 - Don't, Andy, don't.

271
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:23,980
 (laughing)

272
00:09:23,980 --> 00:09:25,060
 - No, okay.

273
00:09:25,060 --> 00:09:28,660
 - For what object you have a passion deep in the soul?

274
00:09:28,660 --> 00:09:32,420
 You could choose a plant, an animal, or a utensil.

275
00:09:32,420 --> 00:09:35,100
 - Oh, it's a great question.

276
00:09:35,100 --> 00:09:37,100
 - I see, I think I see what's happened here.

277
00:09:37,100 --> 00:09:38,280
 - And it's problematic.

278
00:09:38,280 --> 00:09:39,680
 Basically, the one big criticism

279
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:41,280
 of the civil service exams historically

280
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:43,000
 was that they were too pro-former

281
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,480
 and they were all about learning by rote,

282
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:46,000
 didn't encourage creative thinking.

283
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,680
 And I think what they've done is they've swung

284
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:49,600
 way too far the other way.

285
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:51,480
 (laughing)

286
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:54,000
 - Ah, there was a good cheating scandal.

287
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,440
 Well, there were a few great ones recently actually.

288
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:57,720
 This was a niche one that I didn't know about.

289
00:09:57,720 --> 00:09:59,640
 This was in Montana in 2014.

290
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:03,240
 And it was about 90 young officers in the military.

291
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:05,040
 They were caught in a cheating scandal

292
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:06,720
 where they'd been texting each other all the answers

293
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:08,140
 for their questions.

294
00:10:08,140 --> 00:10:09,740
 They had to do a monthly test.

295
00:10:09,740 --> 00:10:11,260
 Unfortunately, they were the officers

296
00:10:11,260 --> 00:10:13,560
 in charge of nuclear missile launch

297
00:10:13,560 --> 00:10:15,100
 at the Malmström Air Force Base

298
00:10:15,100 --> 00:10:17,980
 and they had just been cheating all the way through.

299
00:10:17,980 --> 00:10:19,060
 And 'cause they'd been really worried,

300
00:10:19,060 --> 00:10:20,500
 they thought they had to get 100%

301
00:10:20,500 --> 00:10:22,740
 when actually it's only a 90% pass mark.

302
00:10:22,740 --> 00:10:24,140
 So, yeah.

303
00:10:24,140 --> 00:10:26,220
 - Wait, and they ended up in charge of--

304
00:10:26,220 --> 00:10:27,060
 - Nuclear launch.

305
00:10:27,060 --> 00:10:27,900
 - Right.

306
00:10:27,900 --> 00:10:29,180
 At that point, did they think

307
00:10:29,180 --> 00:10:31,780
 we may have prioritized the wrong thing here?

308
00:10:31,780 --> 00:10:33,700
 - They were all taken off their work.

309
00:10:33,700 --> 00:10:35,860
 And that's why no nukes were launched in 2014.

310
00:10:35,860 --> 00:10:37,660
 - Well, thank God.

311
00:10:37,660 --> 00:10:39,220
 - Thank God, yeah.

312
00:10:39,220 --> 00:10:40,060
 - Did you guys ever cheat?

313
00:10:40,060 --> 00:10:40,900
 Were you cheaters?

314
00:10:40,900 --> 00:10:41,740
 - No. - No.

315
00:10:41,740 --> 00:10:43,060
 - Goodness no.

316
00:10:43,060 --> 00:10:47,020
 - Come on, you're just more dishonest cheaters than I am.

317
00:10:47,020 --> 00:10:49,580
 - No, I would have shopped a cheater if I'd seen one,

318
00:10:49,580 --> 00:10:51,580
 but I was too busy focusing on my own work.

319
00:10:51,580 --> 00:10:53,260
 (audience laughs)

320
00:10:53,260 --> 00:10:54,920
 - I actually cheated for this episode.

321
00:10:54,920 --> 00:10:55,760
 - Did you?

322
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:56,600
 - I sure did, yeah.

323
00:10:56,600 --> 00:10:59,660
 I asked ChatGPT for an interesting fact about cheating.

324
00:10:59,660 --> 00:11:00,480
 - Did you?

325
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:01,320
 - Did you?

326
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:02,160
 - Yeah, sure did.

327
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:04,120
 I said, "Please make it surprising, unusual and quirky."

328
00:11:04,120 --> 00:11:07,780
 They said the headline, "Pigeons as Messengers."

329
00:11:07,780 --> 00:11:10,120
 In the early 2000s, some students in China

330
00:11:10,120 --> 00:11:11,820
 trained pigeons to carry crib sheets.

331
00:11:11,820 --> 00:11:13,220
 The pigeons were released from home

332
00:11:13,220 --> 00:11:14,620
 with the arms as tight as their legs

333
00:11:14,620 --> 00:11:16,740
 and flew to the students during exams.

334
00:11:16,740 --> 00:11:18,260
 It was hard to detect until the authorities

335
00:11:18,260 --> 00:11:19,580
 caught onto the flocks of pigeons

336
00:11:19,580 --> 00:11:21,260
 loitering around the exam halls.

337
00:11:21,260 --> 00:11:23,300
 (audience laughs)

338
00:11:23,300 --> 00:11:25,340
 Now, I have to say, I have tried to fact check this

339
00:11:25,340 --> 00:11:27,220
 and I can't find the evidence.

340
00:11:27,220 --> 00:11:29,580
 (audience laughs)

341
00:11:29,580 --> 00:11:32,420
 But I trust the robots as I think we all should.

342
00:11:32,420 --> 00:11:33,540
 (audience laughs)

343
00:11:33,540 --> 00:11:35,560
 - So why, when you can't find a source for my facts,

344
00:11:35,560 --> 00:11:36,540
 do you not trust it?

345
00:11:36,540 --> 00:11:38,600
 (audience laughs)

346
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:40,260
 - The future is not in your hands, Dan.

347
00:11:40,260 --> 00:11:41,820
 Thank God, so.

348
00:11:41,820 --> 00:11:44,080
 - Have you guys seen the cheating hats that you can get?

349
00:11:44,080 --> 00:11:46,380
 So it's not, you can't actually buy them in retail shops,

350
00:11:46,380 --> 00:11:48,040
 but they happen in school classes

351
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:49,680
 where teachers are a bit concerned

352
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:51,760
 and they make peripheral blockers.

353
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:55,560
 So you wear big elephant ears on the side of this hat.

354
00:11:55,560 --> 00:11:57,160
 So that if you try and look that way,

355
00:11:57,160 --> 00:11:58,960
 they're sort of sitting there, blocking you in.

356
00:11:58,960 --> 00:12:01,080
 - I would write the answers on the wings.

357
00:12:01,080 --> 00:12:02,420
 - Oh, yes.

358
00:12:02,420 --> 00:12:03,960
 Very nice, yeah.

359
00:12:03,960 --> 00:12:05,400
 - But I read an article about that

360
00:12:05,400 --> 00:12:08,120
 and it said that actually students quite like it.

361
00:12:08,120 --> 00:12:10,520
 They kind of feel like they're less stressed

362
00:12:10,520 --> 00:12:12,560
 because like normally they're thinking,

363
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:14,400
 "Oh, people are thinking I'm going to be cheating,"

364
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:16,880
 but it kind of takes it completely out of the equation.

365
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:19,600
 - How the horse loves his blinkers, in a way.

366
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:20,760
 - Oh, to see?

367
00:12:20,760 --> 00:12:21,600
 - I don't know, actually.

368
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:23,520
 I mean, I don't know if horses like blinkers.

369
00:12:23,520 --> 00:12:26,440
 - There's another really good way of stopping people.

370
00:12:26,440 --> 00:12:28,480
 This is five and six year olds,

371
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:30,040
 but it stops them from cheating, right?

372
00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:31,920
 You get them all in a room doing their exam.

373
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:35,300
 They're in lines and you walk in with a magic wand

374
00:12:35,300 --> 00:12:37,700
 and you say, "I'm magicing a barrier between you

375
00:12:37,700 --> 00:12:40,060
 "so you can't read each other's answers,"

376
00:12:40,060 --> 00:12:42,580
 and that is enough to stop them from even trying.

377
00:12:42,580 --> 00:12:44,180
 - Really?

378
00:12:44,180 --> 00:12:45,540
 - They're faking it.

379
00:12:45,540 --> 00:12:47,220
 - You're right, that's great.

380
00:12:47,220 --> 00:12:49,060
 Now there's been a recent study in they found

381
00:12:49,060 --> 00:12:50,860
 that cheating went down by 20%

382
00:12:50,860 --> 00:12:53,340
 by people who did the magic wand tactic.

383
00:12:53,340 --> 00:12:54,180
 - Oh my.

384
00:12:54,180 --> 00:12:55,020
 - The Slytherin.

385
00:12:55,020 --> 00:12:55,860
 You could sort them right there in there.

386
00:12:55,860 --> 00:12:58,340
 (laughing)

387
00:12:58,340 --> 00:13:00,700
 - So in the 15th century, there was an exam

388
00:13:00,700 --> 00:13:02,660
 with one question that was so hard,

389
00:13:02,660 --> 00:13:05,300
 only two men in the entire country got it right.

390
00:13:05,300 --> 00:13:06,620
 - Oh wow.

391
00:13:06,620 --> 00:13:09,940
 - It was Tang Yin and his friend, Zhu Jing.

392
00:13:09,940 --> 00:13:11,020
 - They were both friends and they got it right.

393
00:13:11,020 --> 00:13:12,800
 - They were both friends and they got it right.

394
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:14,460
 And so obviously everyone thought,

395
00:13:14,460 --> 00:13:16,980
 just as Andy thought, "How interesting."

396
00:13:16,980 --> 00:13:19,780
 And so they were arrested,

397
00:13:19,780 --> 00:13:22,260
 accused of bribing officials,

398
00:13:22,260 --> 00:13:25,180
 and they all the way said that they didn't do it,

399
00:13:25,180 --> 00:13:27,540
 but Zhu spent his entire rest of his life

400
00:13:27,540 --> 00:13:29,560
 waiting for a pardon which never came.

401
00:13:29,560 --> 00:13:31,060
 He didn't get his job.

402
00:13:31,060 --> 00:13:33,480
 And it was so bad that all of his descendants

403
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:35,560
 also refused to take the exam.

404
00:13:35,560 --> 00:13:37,500
 - Wait, they refused to take it?

405
00:13:37,500 --> 00:13:38,340
 Or they were refused?

406
00:13:38,340 --> 00:13:39,180
 - They refused to take it.

407
00:13:39,180 --> 00:13:41,220
 They were like, "No, we don't believe in this anymore."

408
00:13:41,220 --> 00:13:45,260
 And his great-great-grandson who's called Zhu Ziaky.

409
00:13:45,260 --> 00:13:47,800
 So that's, think about how long that is later.

410
00:13:47,800 --> 00:13:49,700
 He decided he wasn't gonna take this exam

411
00:13:49,700 --> 00:13:51,500
 because his great-great-grandfather

412
00:13:51,500 --> 00:13:53,420
 had been accused of cheating.

413
00:13:53,420 --> 00:13:56,820
 And he became China's most influential travel writer

414
00:13:56,820 --> 00:13:59,800
 of whatever century was the 18th century.

415
00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:01,920
 Because he would have gone, he was a genius.

416
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:03,400
 He would have gone into the civil service

417
00:14:03,400 --> 00:14:05,440
 because he didn't wanna take the exam.

418
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:06,280
 He did this instead.

419
00:14:06,280 --> 00:14:07,720
 - That's exactly why I didn't take it

420
00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:09,840
 when I was given the chance.

421
00:14:09,840 --> 00:14:10,920
 I had more to give.

422
00:14:10,920 --> 00:14:14,040
 (all laughing)

423
00:14:14,040 --> 00:14:15,640
 - When are you gonna start giving it down?

424
00:14:15,640 --> 00:14:17,800
 (all laughing)

425
00:14:17,800 --> 00:14:20,380
 (upbeat music)

426
00:14:20,380 --> 00:14:26,600
 - It is time for fact number two, and that is Andy.

427
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:29,560
 My fact is that in 2004, musician Jack White

428
00:14:29,560 --> 00:14:32,560
 released a single through the medium of a couch.

429
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:33,400
 - Ooh.

430
00:14:33,400 --> 00:14:37,780
 - So Jack White, he was an upholsterer as a young man.

431
00:14:37,780 --> 00:14:40,380
 And one of his first bands actually was with another guy

432
00:14:40,380 --> 00:14:41,900
 who was an upholsterer.

433
00:14:41,900 --> 00:14:43,020
 They were a two piece band.

434
00:14:43,020 --> 00:14:43,860
 - Oh, that's cool.

435
00:14:43,860 --> 00:14:45,820
 - And they were upholstering by day and playing by night

436
00:14:45,820 --> 00:14:48,840
 and they had a great, then the band name was, any guesses?

437
00:14:48,840 --> 00:14:52,340
 - I was like, "Swayed is much better."

438
00:14:52,340 --> 00:14:54,820
 - They were called the upholsterers.

439
00:14:54,820 --> 00:14:56,420
 (all laughing)

440
00:14:56,420 --> 00:14:57,240
 - Okay.

441
00:14:57,240 --> 00:14:59,720
 - It's so clever, it's so simple, it's clever.

442
00:14:59,720 --> 00:15:01,060
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

443
00:15:01,060 --> 00:15:03,200
 - But he is better known as being in the White Stripes.

444
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:05,760
 - Sorry, yes, White Stripes, and numerous other--

445
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:06,580
 - Not to Andy.

446
00:15:06,580 --> 00:15:09,640
 (all laughing)

447
00:15:09,640 --> 00:15:10,960
 - The Who?

448
00:15:10,960 --> 00:15:11,880
 - No, I lost it.

449
00:15:11,880 --> 00:15:12,960
 - No, no, no, no, fuck.

450
00:15:12,960 --> 00:15:15,200
 (all laughing)

451
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:19,120
 - So, they were in Detroit in 2004.

452
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:21,360
 I think he just set up the White Stripes with Meg White,

453
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:23,400
 but they had this little band and they were working

454
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:27,260
 in an upholstery shop and they smuggled 100 singles

455
00:15:27,260 --> 00:15:31,020
 on vinyl into sofas in the shop that they were working in

456
00:15:31,020 --> 00:15:34,820
 and armchairs and only two have ever been found so far.

457
00:15:34,820 --> 00:15:35,660
 - Yeah.

458
00:15:35,660 --> 00:15:36,500
 - So, how's that?

459
00:15:36,500 --> 00:15:37,740
 - So, is it worth us ripping up our sofas?

460
00:15:37,740 --> 00:15:38,820
 - Yes, it is.

461
00:15:38,820 --> 00:15:40,380
 Go home tonight.

462
00:15:40,380 --> 00:15:41,700
 - 'Cause you don't know, yeah.

463
00:15:41,700 --> 00:15:42,780
 - And get busy.

464
00:15:42,780 --> 00:15:46,100
 And you won't be, even if you've got an x-ray machine,

465
00:15:46,100 --> 00:15:47,420
 you won't be able to x-ray it 'cause they did it

466
00:15:47,420 --> 00:15:50,900
 on transparent clear vinyl with transparency covers.

467
00:15:50,900 --> 00:15:51,940
 So, you cannot see it.

468
00:15:51,940 --> 00:15:53,840
 You can only know by destroying the sofa.

469
00:15:53,840 --> 00:15:54,960
 - They did this as a secret,

470
00:15:54,960 --> 00:15:56,920
 but we released a vinyl didn't we?

471
00:15:56,920 --> 00:16:00,500
 Years ago with Altenpop, this amazing record label.

472
00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:01,940
 And we also sold two copies.

473
00:16:01,940 --> 00:16:03,580
 (all laughing)

474
00:16:03,580 --> 00:16:06,480
 But they had this amazing idea for one of their bands

475
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:08,600
 where they released the album,

476
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:10,360
 but the only way you could buy the album

477
00:16:10,360 --> 00:16:12,560
 was to get it on the USB stick that they provided.

478
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:15,040
 But the USB stick only came connected

479
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:17,040
 to a very expensive bicycle.

480
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:19,360
 So, you had to buy the bicycle in order to do it.

481
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:21,200
 So, to buy the bicycle, that equates it

482
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:23,500
 to something like 1,000 record sales

483
00:16:23,500 --> 00:16:24,860
 because it was a really good bike.

484
00:16:24,860 --> 00:16:27,140
 And so, the band technically sold,

485
00:16:27,140 --> 00:16:29,860
 in terms of building back their royalties, 1,000 copies.

486
00:16:29,860 --> 00:16:32,740
 So, that is ways that bands do that now.

487
00:16:32,740 --> 00:16:34,340
 - Wait, so did they just sell one?

488
00:16:34,340 --> 00:16:35,180
 - Just one.

489
00:16:35,180 --> 00:16:36,300
 - One sucker bought the bike.

490
00:16:36,300 --> 00:16:37,140
 - Yeah.

491
00:16:37,140 --> 00:16:37,980
 - Okay.

492
00:16:37,980 --> 00:16:38,820
 (laughing)

493
00:16:38,820 --> 00:16:40,380
 - Things in sofas?

494
00:16:40,380 --> 00:16:41,220
 - Sure.

495
00:16:41,220 --> 00:16:42,220
 - Things in sofas.

496
00:16:42,220 --> 00:16:44,980
 - If anyone is a phobic of snakes,

497
00:16:44,980 --> 00:16:46,300
 might want to pop out for a bit.

498
00:16:46,300 --> 00:16:47,460
 (audience laughing)

499
00:16:47,460 --> 00:16:49,340
 This was something that happened quite recently.

500
00:16:49,340 --> 00:16:51,160
 North Ayrshire, in Scotland,

501
00:16:51,160 --> 00:16:53,160
 staff were cleaning a sofa at a second-hand shop

502
00:16:53,160 --> 00:16:55,280
 and a python fell out of it.

503
00:16:55,280 --> 00:16:56,240
 - Oh.

504
00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:57,080
 - Dead?

505
00:16:57,080 --> 00:16:57,920
 - Dead.

506
00:16:57,920 --> 00:16:58,740
 - Okay.

507
00:16:58,740 --> 00:16:59,560
 - So, that's fine.

508
00:16:59,560 --> 00:17:00,400
 So, it was a second-hand shop and they were cleaning it.

509
00:17:00,400 --> 00:17:01,240
 - Not fine for the python.

510
00:17:01,240 --> 00:17:02,080
 - Not fine for the python.

511
00:17:02,080 --> 00:17:05,160
 But, get this, the people who donated the sofa

512
00:17:05,160 --> 00:17:07,560
 confirmed that they had never had a pet snake

513
00:17:07,560 --> 00:17:10,480
 and that they had got it second-hand themselves.

514
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:12,760
 So, it had been the whole time they had owned it.

515
00:17:12,760 --> 00:17:14,600
 It had probably been in there.

516
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:15,440
 - Right.

517
00:17:15,440 --> 00:17:16,920
 - Did they not decompose pythons?

518
00:17:16,920 --> 00:17:17,760
 - No.

519
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:19,100
 - Is there something special about that?

520
00:17:19,100 --> 00:17:19,940
 (audience laughing)

521
00:17:19,940 --> 00:17:20,920
 And that's why when you walk the streets of London,

522
00:17:20,920 --> 00:17:22,760
 you'd ankle deep in dead pythons.

523
00:17:22,760 --> 00:17:23,600
 - Yeah.

524
00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:24,440
 - They'd just stick around, yeah.

525
00:17:24,440 --> 00:17:25,280
 - Amazing.

526
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:26,120
 - I know.

527
00:17:26,120 --> 00:17:28,540
 And the spokesman for the second-hand place said,

528
00:17:28,540 --> 00:17:30,440
 "Don't let this discourage you from buying re-use

529
00:17:30,440 --> 00:17:31,280
 from others.

530
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:32,880
 This is a very, very rare downside."

531
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:34,800
 (audience laughing)

532
00:17:34,800 --> 00:17:37,520
 - There was a study in, well, there were two studies in 2016

533
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:39,920
 and one of them found that the typical Brit

534
00:17:39,920 --> 00:17:43,480
 finds £3.27 a year in their sofa,

535
00:17:43,480 --> 00:17:44,880
 which is exciting.

536
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:46,040
 That was in March.

537
00:17:46,040 --> 00:17:48,640
 And then, in October, there was another study

538
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:52,620
 showing that the average Brit finds £5.77 in their sofa.

539
00:17:52,620 --> 00:17:53,460
 What's happened between--

540
00:17:53,460 --> 00:17:55,580
 - Well, obviously, the first study

541
00:17:55,580 --> 00:17:57,140
 has brought it to everyone's attention

542
00:17:57,140 --> 00:17:58,620
 and everyone's gone, "Oh, I'm going to look at myself

543
00:17:58,620 --> 00:17:59,460
 in that one." - Oh, yeah.

544
00:17:59,460 --> 00:18:00,540
 - The average has gone way up.

545
00:18:00,540 --> 00:18:01,620
 - What year was this?

546
00:18:01,620 --> 00:18:02,460
 Was this recently?

547
00:18:02,460 --> 00:18:03,300
 - 2016.

548
00:18:03,300 --> 00:18:04,120
 - 2016.

549
00:18:04,120 --> 00:18:04,960
 - I feel like it's going down.

550
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:05,780
 - It must have changed since then.

551
00:18:05,780 --> 00:18:06,620
 - Yeah, yeah.

552
00:18:06,620 --> 00:18:08,060
 - These days, you'll find half a Bitcoin down there.

553
00:18:08,060 --> 00:18:09,380
 (audience laughing)

554
00:18:09,380 --> 00:18:13,700
 - I read the study from 2017 that said 52% of people

555
00:18:13,700 --> 00:18:16,380
 had lost money down the side of their sofa

556
00:18:16,380 --> 00:18:21,380
 and only 46% said they found any money down their sofa.

557
00:18:21,380 --> 00:18:22,920
 - So there's money to be found?

558
00:18:22,920 --> 00:18:25,160
 - No, unfortunately, 6% of people said

559
00:18:25,160 --> 00:18:27,240
 they found money down someone else's sofa.

560
00:18:27,240 --> 00:18:30,240
 (audience laughing)

561
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:34,240
 - Hey, I read a crazy thing about sofas.

562
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:35,880
 This blew my mind today.

563
00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:37,720
 If you go and you off to buy a sofa

564
00:18:37,720 --> 00:18:39,040
 and you want to get a leather sofa

565
00:18:39,040 --> 00:18:42,120
 and you see in the shop, it says genuine leather,

566
00:18:42,120 --> 00:18:45,600
 you go, "Ah, that's going to be a great sofa," right?

567
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:46,440
 - Right.

568
00:18:46,440 --> 00:18:47,280
 - It's a cheat.

569
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:48,120
 It's a cheat.

570
00:18:48,120 --> 00:18:48,960
 - What?

571
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:49,800
 - It's okay.

572
00:18:49,800 --> 00:18:51,960
 There are five kinds of leather sofas

573
00:18:51,960 --> 00:18:54,260
 that you can get in terms of quality

574
00:18:54,260 --> 00:18:57,500
 and the fourth worst is genuine leather

575
00:18:57,500 --> 00:18:59,980
 because they just call it genuine leather.

576
00:18:59,980 --> 00:19:00,820
 That's its name.

577
00:19:00,820 --> 00:19:01,660
 - Is it not leather?

578
00:19:01,660 --> 00:19:03,760
 - No, it can be up to the discretion of the maker.

579
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:06,520
 It could be anything between one and 100% leather.

580
00:19:06,520 --> 00:19:08,660
 They could put 2% leather in there

581
00:19:08,660 --> 00:19:10,540
 and they market it as genuine leather

582
00:19:10,540 --> 00:19:12,400
 'cause that's what you call that style.

583
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:13,700
 - Oh my God.

584
00:19:13,700 --> 00:19:14,580
 - Who do we write to?

585
00:19:14,580 --> 00:19:16,660
 - We are about to get sued by DFS.

586
00:19:16,660 --> 00:19:18,500
 - Really?

587
00:19:18,500 --> 00:19:19,920
 What are the other things called?

588
00:19:19,920 --> 00:19:21,480
 What's the genuine leather?

589
00:19:21,480 --> 00:19:23,660
 Okay, full grain leather is number one.

590
00:19:23,660 --> 00:19:25,260
 Top grain leather is number two,

591
00:19:25,260 --> 00:19:26,860
 which again, a bit confusing.

592
00:19:26,860 --> 00:19:29,060
 Split grain leather, number three.

593
00:19:29,060 --> 00:19:31,060
 Genuine leather comes in at number four

594
00:19:31,060 --> 00:19:32,340
 and then bonded leather,

595
00:19:32,340 --> 00:19:34,340
 which is basically just whatever the fuck

596
00:19:34,340 --> 00:19:36,460
 they want to put together.

597
00:19:36,460 --> 00:19:38,220
 - What's the 1% leather?

598
00:19:38,220 --> 00:19:39,460
 That's not good, yeah.

599
00:19:39,460 --> 00:19:41,100
 - Yeah, so just next time you're in a shop

600
00:19:41,100 --> 00:19:42,940
 and you see genuine leather, it's not.

601
00:19:42,940 --> 00:19:43,780
 - Good Lord.

602
00:19:43,780 --> 00:19:44,780
 - That's really good.

603
00:19:44,780 --> 00:19:46,660
 You should do consumer programs.

604
00:19:46,660 --> 00:19:47,980
 - Oh yeah.

605
00:19:47,980 --> 00:19:49,820
 - I see that in your stars.

606
00:19:49,820 --> 00:19:52,580
 Last year, police found something

607
00:19:52,580 --> 00:19:55,100
 down the back of a sofa in Florida

608
00:19:55,100 --> 00:19:57,780
 and it was a suspected drug dealer named Stacy.

609
00:19:57,780 --> 00:20:02,780
 And she was caught between the folds of a sofa.

610
00:20:02,780 --> 00:20:03,620
 - Oh my God.

611
00:20:03,620 --> 00:20:06,620
 - She was in there, the arrest photo is phenomenally good.

612
00:20:06,620 --> 00:20:07,460
 It's so good.

613
00:20:07,460 --> 00:20:08,940
 She's just emerging.

614
00:20:08,940 --> 00:20:09,780
 - But that is the most,

615
00:20:09,780 --> 00:20:12,140
 it's one of the most insanely awesome disguises

616
00:20:12,140 --> 00:20:12,980
 you'll ever see.

617
00:20:12,980 --> 00:20:14,540
 I know we've mentioned this a bunch of times before,

618
00:20:14,540 --> 00:20:17,020
 but like people who were trying to get across

619
00:20:17,020 --> 00:20:18,420
 from one side of Germany to the other

620
00:20:18,420 --> 00:20:20,620
 during the Berlin Wall, they would go in cars

621
00:20:20,620 --> 00:20:22,300
 and they would be the passenger seat.

622
00:20:22,300 --> 00:20:25,460
 So they would be inside, sitting within the leather.

623
00:20:25,460 --> 00:20:27,500
 Back in the day when they were taking Victorian photos

624
00:20:27,500 --> 00:20:29,380
 and kids because of the exposure time,

625
00:20:29,380 --> 00:20:31,580
 you'd have to take a photo, take one and a half minutes.

626
00:20:31,580 --> 00:20:33,620
 Parents would dress up as the sofa

627
00:20:33,620 --> 00:20:35,940
 and hold the kids on their legs

628
00:20:35,940 --> 00:20:38,220
 so that the kid would stay there for the minute and a half.

629
00:20:38,220 --> 00:20:39,060
 It took to do it.

630
00:20:39,060 --> 00:20:41,140
 Like we've got a whole history of dressing up

631
00:20:41,140 --> 00:20:46,140
 as sofas to do it, advance our species.

632
00:20:46,140 --> 00:20:47,060
 - Do you say advance?

633
00:20:47,060 --> 00:20:47,900
 - Yeah.

634
00:20:47,900 --> 00:20:48,740
 - Advance our species.

635
00:20:48,740 --> 00:20:49,860
 - Oh, advance, yeah, yeah, yeah.

636
00:20:49,860 --> 00:20:52,860
 - I actually wanna, I've got to be in my bonnet about that

637
00:20:52,860 --> 00:20:54,420
 since you've raised it, which you have.

638
00:20:54,420 --> 00:20:55,460
 - J.D. Vance.

639
00:20:55,460 --> 00:20:57,100
 - J.D. Vance.

640
00:20:57,100 --> 00:20:58,580
 I was told, 'cause I'm not on social media

641
00:20:58,580 --> 00:21:01,740
 and so I don't pick up on sort of the news.

642
00:21:01,740 --> 00:21:03,660
 When I pick up on the real news, it's not on social media

643
00:21:03,660 --> 00:21:06,420
 but not the crap news that the rest of you read.

644
00:21:06,420 --> 00:21:10,940
 And you guys told me he had sex with a sofa.

645
00:21:11,940 --> 00:21:15,820
 - J.D. Vance, for future lists of the podcast is...

646
00:21:15,820 --> 00:21:17,140
 - What's the president?

647
00:21:17,140 --> 00:21:20,420
 (audience laughing)

648
00:21:20,420 --> 00:21:22,100
 - But who'd have thought that first lady,

649
00:21:22,100 --> 00:21:25,540
 the enormous sofa that came to the White House with a...

650
00:21:25,540 --> 00:21:28,780
 (audience laughing)

651
00:21:28,780 --> 00:21:30,380
 - Yeah, Travis surrounding me.

652
00:21:30,380 --> 00:21:31,740
 Someone just made it up on Twitter,

653
00:21:31,740 --> 00:21:34,020
 the idea that he'd had sex with a sofa.

654
00:21:34,020 --> 00:21:35,060
 - I see it's fake.

655
00:21:35,060 --> 00:21:35,900
 - It's completely fake.

656
00:21:35,900 --> 00:21:36,820
 - It's pure fake, it's pure fake.

657
00:21:36,820 --> 00:21:38,300
 It could have been one of your facts then.

658
00:21:38,300 --> 00:21:40,980
 There's not a grain of truth in it.

659
00:21:40,980 --> 00:21:41,980
 No, it is, it's not fake.

660
00:21:41,980 --> 00:21:44,500
 It's really not, yeah, it's genuinely nonsense.

661
00:21:44,500 --> 00:21:47,140
 - And now people feel they need to be referencing it.

662
00:21:47,140 --> 00:21:48,380
 What's happened to American debate?

663
00:21:48,380 --> 00:21:51,060
 Walt said, running mate of...

664
00:21:51,060 --> 00:21:53,060
 - Oh, he used to be the leader of the resistance, yes.

665
00:21:53,060 --> 00:21:54,860
 (audience laughing)

666
00:21:54,860 --> 00:21:56,300
 - I can't wait to debate this guy.

667
00:21:56,300 --> 00:21:59,020
 That is, if he's willing to get off the couch and show up.

668
00:21:59,020 --> 00:21:59,860
 I mean...

669
00:21:59,860 --> 00:22:01,020
 - Yeah, it was a bit weird.

670
00:22:01,020 --> 00:22:03,460
 - It's all gone a bit weird, hasn't it?

671
00:22:03,460 --> 00:22:06,020
 - Here's the thing, to get a bit political,

672
00:22:06,020 --> 00:22:08,660
 which is the most English way of saying

673
00:22:08,660 --> 00:22:12,260
 that item of furniture, sofa, couch, or seti?

674
00:22:12,260 --> 00:22:13,820
 - What's the most English way of saying it?

675
00:22:13,820 --> 00:22:14,660
 - Yeah.

676
00:22:14,660 --> 00:22:17,020
 - Okay, so couch is, I think, from French Couché.

677
00:22:17,020 --> 00:22:18,700
 So that's not a... - Good, very good.

678
00:22:18,700 --> 00:22:20,060
 - Okay, so what's left, couch and seti?

679
00:22:20,060 --> 00:22:22,860
 - Sofa, seti. - Sorry, sofa and seti.

680
00:22:22,860 --> 00:22:26,260
 - Sofa, did I read that one from Arabic?

681
00:22:26,260 --> 00:22:27,380
 - Very good.

682
00:22:27,380 --> 00:22:28,700
 - I shouldn't ask these questions to people

683
00:22:28,700 --> 00:22:30,740
 who've just spent a day researching sofas,

684
00:22:30,740 --> 00:22:31,580
 should I really?

685
00:22:31,580 --> 00:22:35,100
 - I think, yes, I think it's on the sofa in Arabic.

686
00:22:35,100 --> 00:22:37,780
 - Yeah, but I actually don't know what seti is from, so...

687
00:22:37,780 --> 00:22:39,580
 - It's from the old English setam,

688
00:22:39,580 --> 00:22:42,300
 meaning to sit down, like, to set something down.

689
00:22:42,300 --> 00:22:43,340
 - So that's properly old English?

690
00:22:43,340 --> 00:22:45,180
 - So if you want to speak proper old English,

691
00:22:45,180 --> 00:22:46,740
 I think there are different, like,

692
00:22:46,740 --> 00:22:50,060
 sofas have different arms and stuff like that these days.

693
00:22:50,060 --> 00:22:51,140
 Do you know what, in France,

694
00:22:51,140 --> 00:22:52,900
 they call one of those sofas

695
00:22:52,900 --> 00:22:54,980
 that has just one arm at the back of it,

696
00:22:54,980 --> 00:22:56,140
 and you kind of lie on it.

697
00:22:56,140 --> 00:22:57,300
 - I think that is a chaise longue.

698
00:22:57,300 --> 00:23:01,900
 - No, they call it a meridienne in France, a chaise longue.

699
00:23:01,900 --> 00:23:03,380
 If they're talking about a chaise longue,

700
00:23:03,380 --> 00:23:06,100
 they're referring to a deque chair.

701
00:23:06,100 --> 00:23:07,460
 - Isn't that interesting? - Isn't it really?

702
00:23:07,460 --> 00:23:08,620
 - Yeah.

703
00:23:08,620 --> 00:23:10,100
 - French for deque chair is chaise longue.

704
00:23:10,100 --> 00:23:12,860
 - A genuine murmur of shock and dismay went through the roof of that.

705
00:23:12,860 --> 00:23:14,460
 That's really interesting.

706
00:23:14,460 --> 00:23:17,140
 - What is a deque chair, if not a chaise longue

707
00:23:17,140 --> 00:23:19,500
 with all the cushions ripped off and put outside, I suppose?

708
00:23:19,500 --> 00:23:20,340
 - Exactly.

709
00:23:20,340 --> 00:23:21,820
 - Yeah, you just see where they're coming from.

710
00:23:21,820 --> 00:23:24,780
 - I'm very one of those Chinese civil service exams,

711
00:23:24,780 --> 00:23:25,940
 with musings like that.

712
00:23:25,940 --> 00:23:27,620
 Do you want to hear some sofa slang?

713
00:23:27,620 --> 00:23:28,460
 - Yeah.

714
00:23:28,460 --> 00:23:30,620
 - What is a sofa pounder?

715
00:23:30,620 --> 00:23:31,980
 - We're not back on chaisee pants, you know.

716
00:23:31,980 --> 00:23:34,180
 - No, come on.

717
00:23:34,180 --> 00:23:36,020
 Grow up.

718
00:23:36,020 --> 00:23:40,060
 - Is it a burger, but the buns look like sofas?

719
00:23:40,060 --> 00:23:41,380
 - That's really good.

720
00:23:41,380 --> 00:23:43,620
 - Oh, is it when you do, is it that cushion process

721
00:23:43,620 --> 00:23:47,740
 where you do the judo chop to make the sofa plump up?

722
00:23:47,740 --> 00:23:48,580
 Do you know what I mean?

723
00:23:48,580 --> 00:23:49,420
 - Yeah.

724
00:23:49,420 --> 00:23:50,260
 - That's a sofa pounder.

725
00:23:50,260 --> 00:23:52,460
 No, it's just an observer or a non-participant.

726
00:23:52,460 --> 00:23:53,860
 You're just sitting on the sofa.

727
00:23:53,860 --> 00:23:57,420
 What is to couch a porker?

728
00:23:57,420 --> 00:24:00,260
 - Again, guys.

729
00:24:00,260 --> 00:24:01,860
 - Did you have all this before, Anna told you

730
00:24:01,860 --> 00:24:04,140
 that JD Vance didn't do this.

731
00:24:04,140 --> 00:24:06,860
 - It's wasted research, so I'm just reading it out.

732
00:24:06,860 --> 00:24:09,500
 - So couch a porker, something to do with pig farming?

733
00:24:09,500 --> 00:24:10,340
 - No.

734
00:24:10,340 --> 00:24:11,780
 - Is there something to do with lyes?

735
00:24:11,780 --> 00:24:13,700
 - It's to just lie down and have a nap.

736
00:24:13,700 --> 00:24:15,540
 - Well, a different kind of lie, actually, but okay.

737
00:24:15,540 --> 00:24:18,060
 - And what is couch hockey for one?

738
00:24:18,060 --> 00:24:21,300
 (audience laughing)

739
00:24:21,300 --> 00:24:22,660
 - That one is rude.

740
00:24:22,660 --> 00:24:25,020
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, that one is rude.

741
00:24:25,020 --> 00:24:27,600
 (upbeat music)

742
00:24:29,900 --> 00:24:33,300
 - It is time for fact number three, and that is my fact.

743
00:24:33,300 --> 00:24:35,780
 My fact this week is that the mathematician

744
00:24:35,780 --> 00:24:39,540
 who developed GPS didn't make it to the job interview

745
00:24:39,540 --> 00:24:41,940
 where she'd later developed GPS

746
00:24:41,940 --> 00:24:45,540
 because she couldn't work out the directions to get there.

747
00:24:45,540 --> 00:24:47,460
 - Ah, 'cause you haven't invented GPS yet.

748
00:24:47,460 --> 00:24:49,100
 - Yeah, exactly, yeah.

749
00:24:49,100 --> 00:24:53,380
 This is an amazing woman, so Gladys West.

750
00:24:53,380 --> 00:24:54,220
 - Gladys?

751
00:24:54,220 --> 00:24:57,700
 - I think it's just, it's spelled with a Y,

752
00:24:57,700 --> 00:24:58,780
 but I think it's just Gladys.

753
00:24:58,780 --> 00:25:00,700
 So Gladys West, yeah.

754
00:25:00,700 --> 00:25:02,100
 - Are you saying the woman who invented GPS

755
00:25:02,100 --> 00:25:03,260
 has West in her name?

756
00:25:03,260 --> 00:25:04,100
 - Isn't that amazing?

757
00:25:04,100 --> 00:25:04,940
 - That's crackers.

758
00:25:04,940 --> 00:25:06,660
 - Yeah, yeah, so she's a co-developer

759
00:25:06,660 --> 00:25:08,620
 and she is an incredible woman.

760
00:25:08,620 --> 00:25:11,020
 She's still alive, she's in her 90s

761
00:25:11,020 --> 00:25:14,500
 and she believed for numbers of reasons

762
00:25:14,500 --> 00:25:16,100
 that she shouldn't go to this job interview,

763
00:25:16,100 --> 00:25:18,420
 which was offered to her, which was with the Navy

764
00:25:18,420 --> 00:25:20,100
 in America and she was an African-American.

765
00:25:20,100 --> 00:25:21,300
 She thought they're not gonna give me a job.

766
00:25:21,300 --> 00:25:24,360
 No women like me are given any kind of job.

767
00:25:24,360 --> 00:25:26,780
 There's only four people of color within the company as is.

768
00:25:26,780 --> 00:25:28,180
 Why would they give it to me?

769
00:25:28,180 --> 00:25:30,100
 I can't actually find it on a map,

770
00:25:30,100 --> 00:25:33,580
 so I don't know where I'm going even to get there.

771
00:25:33,580 --> 00:25:37,100
 And I just don't do job interviews 'cause I'm that good.

772
00:25:37,100 --> 00:25:39,940
 So she didn't go for the job interview,

773
00:25:39,940 --> 00:25:42,020
 but then they did end up chasing after her

774
00:25:42,020 --> 00:25:43,020
 and giving her the job.

775
00:25:43,020 --> 00:25:45,940
 And then many years later, through lots of developments,

776
00:25:45,940 --> 00:25:47,820
 she created what was the framework

777
00:25:47,820 --> 00:25:50,020
 of what then became GPS.

778
00:25:50,020 --> 00:25:52,980
 And so even then, after she invented this

779
00:25:52,980 --> 00:25:55,040
 or helped to invent this life-changing thing,

780
00:25:55,040 --> 00:25:56,060
 she still never used it

781
00:25:56,060 --> 00:25:57,660
 'cause she just preferred road maps.

782
00:25:57,660 --> 00:25:58,740
 (laughing)

783
00:25:58,740 --> 00:25:59,900
 And I think, is this right?

784
00:25:59,900 --> 00:26:01,500
 'Cause this is just from what I read.

785
00:26:01,500 --> 00:26:03,820
 But if GPS is like satellites,

786
00:26:03,820 --> 00:26:06,900
 it tells you where you are by things about snow satellites,

787
00:26:06,900 --> 00:26:09,380
 but they need to know the shape of the Earth.

788
00:26:09,380 --> 00:26:10,380
 And the Earth is not just--

789
00:26:10,380 --> 00:26:11,220
 - Round.

790
00:26:11,220 --> 00:26:12,620
 - There you go, Gladys.

791
00:26:12,620 --> 00:26:14,780
 - Oh, well, well, well, well.

792
00:26:14,780 --> 00:26:16,380
 - It is a rocky era.

793
00:26:16,380 --> 00:26:18,340
 It's not round, that's the whole point.

794
00:26:18,340 --> 00:26:19,900
 I mean, we know that it's a spheroid,

795
00:26:19,900 --> 00:26:21,700
 it's thicker at the equator,

796
00:26:21,700 --> 00:26:24,840
 but also there's lumps and bumps and tidal poles

797
00:26:24,840 --> 00:26:26,260
 and all that kind of stuff.

798
00:26:26,260 --> 00:26:28,180
 And she worked out the algorithms that account

799
00:26:28,180 --> 00:26:30,420
 for all of these little bumps on the Earth.

800
00:26:30,420 --> 00:26:31,380
 - Yeah. - Yeah.

801
00:26:31,380 --> 00:26:32,820
 - And she did amazing things.

802
00:26:32,820 --> 00:26:34,500
 Like she was one of the people to determine

803
00:26:34,500 --> 00:26:37,500
 the movement of Pluto in relation to Neptune.

804
00:26:37,500 --> 00:26:38,340
 Amazing person.

805
00:26:38,340 --> 00:26:41,780
 By the way, Neptune was discovered by a couch.

806
00:26:41,780 --> 00:26:43,900
 - Well, yeah. - Go on.

807
00:26:43,900 --> 00:26:46,380
 - I said, John Couch Adams.

808
00:26:46,380 --> 00:26:48,740
 He was a British mathematician and astronomer.

809
00:26:48,740 --> 00:26:49,580
 Yeah, and he--

810
00:26:49,580 --> 00:26:52,980
 - I only referred him as John Sofa Adams.

811
00:26:52,980 --> 00:26:55,660
 - That's from the Arabic, he's John Sati Adams, actually.

812
00:26:55,660 --> 00:26:59,700
 - I sort of vaguely knew that GPS was a military thing.

813
00:26:59,700 --> 00:27:02,060
 Or like an American Department of Defense

814
00:27:02,060 --> 00:27:02,900
 sort of something thing.

815
00:27:02,900 --> 00:27:03,740
 But I had no idea.

816
00:27:03,740 --> 00:27:07,260
 It was really like, it's properly, it's still run by,

817
00:27:07,260 --> 00:27:08,580
 do you know who runs it these days?

818
00:27:08,580 --> 00:27:10,140
 - Space Force.

819
00:27:10,140 --> 00:27:11,940
 - Oh. - Space Force.

820
00:27:11,940 --> 00:27:12,780
 It's been handed over to them.

821
00:27:12,780 --> 00:27:15,340
 They're very new and they've got control of GPS now.

822
00:27:15,340 --> 00:27:17,620
 - Are they under the auspices of the US still

823
00:27:17,620 --> 00:27:18,500
 or has it been globalized?

824
00:27:18,500 --> 00:27:19,780
 - Space Force has not been spun out.

825
00:27:19,780 --> 00:27:20,620
 It's still, yeah, yeah.

826
00:27:20,620 --> 00:27:21,700
 - It's still America. - It's America.

827
00:27:21,700 --> 00:27:23,540
 - America. - Oh, the US government.

828
00:27:23,540 --> 00:27:24,380
 - Yeah, it's US government.

829
00:27:24,380 --> 00:27:27,700
 - The master control station is in Colorado.

830
00:27:27,700 --> 00:27:29,700
 And they're really young as well.

831
00:27:29,700 --> 00:27:31,980
 The average age of the, I don't know if they're called conductors.

832
00:27:31,980 --> 00:27:33,220
 They can't be called conductors.

833
00:27:33,220 --> 00:27:34,740
 Like, ding, ding, ding.

834
00:27:34,740 --> 00:27:37,020
 Everyone aboard the Space Force.

835
00:27:37,020 --> 00:27:37,860
 All aboard.

836
00:27:37,860 --> 00:27:40,260
 That's good.

837
00:27:40,260 --> 00:27:43,260
 No, but their average age is 23.

838
00:27:43,260 --> 00:27:44,100
 It's very heavy response.

839
00:27:44,100 --> 00:27:45,380
 - Wow. - That's, I know.

840
00:27:45,380 --> 00:27:46,860
 - Oh my God. - No, I can't trust that.

841
00:27:46,860 --> 00:27:47,700
 - I know.

842
00:27:47,700 --> 00:27:48,540
 - But it's-- - But it was--

843
00:27:48,540 --> 00:27:50,860
 - Hang on, like NASA, the Apollo missions,

844
00:27:50,860 --> 00:27:53,220
 everyone in mission control were youngins.

845
00:27:53,220 --> 00:27:55,660
 They were all late teens. - Were they 23?

846
00:27:55,660 --> 00:27:56,820
 - That's true. - Yeah, yeah, they were all,

847
00:27:56,820 --> 00:27:58,020
 they were all late teens.

848
00:27:58,020 --> 00:28:01,460
 - Give us a cheer if you're older than 23 in the audience.

849
00:28:01,460 --> 00:28:02,980
 (audience cheering)

850
00:28:02,980 --> 00:28:03,940
 - Nice.

851
00:28:03,940 --> 00:28:06,620
 Do we dare ask the following question?

852
00:28:06,620 --> 00:28:08,540
 Give us a cheer if you're under 23?

853
00:28:08,540 --> 00:28:11,420
 - Yeah. - Well, don't be ashamed.

854
00:28:11,420 --> 00:28:14,900
 - We've got an audience of people

855
00:28:14,900 --> 00:28:17,380
 who are too old to be in NASA.

856
00:28:17,380 --> 00:28:19,100
 I think that's what we've discovered.

857
00:28:19,100 --> 00:28:20,780
 - But the aim of it, according to Brad Parkinson,

858
00:28:20,780 --> 00:28:22,700
 it was also one of the guys named

859
00:28:22,700 --> 00:28:23,700
 the father of GPS.

860
00:28:23,700 --> 00:28:25,300
 I mean, all sorts of people are given titles about it,

861
00:28:25,300 --> 00:28:26,340
 but he was very important.

862
00:28:26,340 --> 00:28:30,220
 The mission was to drop five bombs in the same hole.

863
00:28:30,220 --> 00:28:32,020
 - Wow. - Wow, that is--

864
00:28:32,020 --> 00:28:34,300
 - Why do you want to drop five bombs in the same hole?

865
00:28:34,300 --> 00:28:38,140
 - In case, I think he was in a high-falutin' way

866
00:28:38,140 --> 00:28:39,700
 trying to say we need accuracy

867
00:28:39,700 --> 00:28:41,780
 in terms of where we're dropping our lethal bombs.

868
00:28:41,780 --> 00:28:42,940
 - Oh, I see.

869
00:28:42,940 --> 00:28:45,100
 - I don't think there was a particularly dangerous hole

870
00:28:45,100 --> 00:28:47,060
 that they needed to subdue.

871
00:28:47,060 --> 00:28:49,100
 - We've got to destroy that hole every time we hit it.

872
00:28:49,100 --> 00:28:50,100
 It just gets bigger.

873
00:28:50,100 --> 00:28:52,340
 (laughing)

874
00:28:52,340 --> 00:28:57,100
 - There was a worry, wasn't there,

875
00:28:57,100 --> 00:29:00,020
 that UK Trident Missiles used GPS

876
00:29:00,020 --> 00:29:02,820
 because GPS is an American military thing.

877
00:29:02,820 --> 00:29:04,620
 And if we were to go to war with America,

878
00:29:04,620 --> 00:29:06,580
 all they'd have to do is turn off the GPS

879
00:29:06,580 --> 00:29:08,460
 and our missiles wouldn't be able to hit anywhere.

880
00:29:08,460 --> 00:29:09,300
 - Right.

881
00:29:09,300 --> 00:29:10,980
 - But I believe that isn't true

882
00:29:10,980 --> 00:29:13,220
 because I was reading about how Trident Missiles

883
00:29:13,220 --> 00:29:14,380
 find their way to places.

884
00:29:14,380 --> 00:29:15,380
 And this is amazing.

885
00:29:15,380 --> 00:29:17,660
 They use stellar sighting.

886
00:29:17,660 --> 00:29:18,500
 - What's that mean?

887
00:29:18,500 --> 00:29:19,860
 - They look at the stars.

888
00:29:19,860 --> 00:29:20,700
 - What?

889
00:29:20,700 --> 00:29:21,980
 - Isn't that amazing? - That's incredible.

890
00:29:21,980 --> 00:29:26,540
 - Even at daytime, they can lock onto 11 stars.

891
00:29:26,540 --> 00:29:27,820
 - I guess it is. - Isn't that insane?

892
00:29:27,820 --> 00:29:28,860
 - I've got an app. - That's amazing.

893
00:29:28,860 --> 00:29:29,980
 - I've got an app where you can see

894
00:29:29,980 --> 00:29:32,180
 where the stars are even in daytime and that.

895
00:29:32,180 --> 00:29:34,260
 So, yeah, it's actually less impressive

896
00:29:34,260 --> 00:29:35,780
 when you know that they actually know

897
00:29:35,780 --> 00:29:37,700
 where they are and it's not through vision.

898
00:29:37,700 --> 00:29:38,540
 - Yeah, but you're a person.

899
00:29:38,540 --> 00:29:39,540
 This is a piece of rock.

900
00:29:39,540 --> 00:29:40,780
 It's a bit of rock, though.

901
00:29:40,780 --> 00:29:43,260
 (laughing)

902
00:29:43,260 --> 00:29:44,300
 Look, it's Trident, all right?

903
00:29:44,300 --> 00:29:45,940
 It's probably gonna be a bit old.

904
00:29:45,940 --> 00:29:48,300
 But that's unbelievable.

905
00:29:48,300 --> 00:29:51,260
 'Cause you don't want, if you've got your missiles,

906
00:29:51,260 --> 00:29:53,700
 you don't want them to rely on this technology,

907
00:29:53,700 --> 00:29:56,420
 which could be knocked out by someone else's Space Force.

908
00:29:56,420 --> 00:29:58,420
 - Yeah. - Wow.

909
00:29:58,420 --> 00:30:01,700
 - Mind you, using 11, why do you need to use so many?

910
00:30:01,700 --> 00:30:04,420
 'Cause GPS, we use four.

911
00:30:04,420 --> 00:30:06,540
 - Four what? - Four satellites, sorry.

912
00:30:06,540 --> 00:30:08,460
 So when we're navigating by GPS,

913
00:30:08,460 --> 00:30:10,620
 it means that the receiver in your car,

914
00:30:10,620 --> 00:30:13,460
 that's receiving signals from four satellites.

915
00:30:13,460 --> 00:30:15,780
 But I spent, I must have wasted four hours

916
00:30:15,780 --> 00:30:17,420
 working out why the fourth one exists.

917
00:30:17,420 --> 00:30:20,300
 So three of them are to, basically,

918
00:30:20,300 --> 00:30:22,260
 you work out how far you are from one satellite.

919
00:30:22,260 --> 00:30:24,260
 Then there's like a radius drawn around that

920
00:30:24,260 --> 00:30:25,460
 and you could be anywhere on that line.

921
00:30:25,460 --> 00:30:27,860
 And then you work out how far you are from a second

922
00:30:27,860 --> 00:30:30,220
 and that gives you two possible positions you could be in.

923
00:30:30,220 --> 00:30:32,140
 And then you work out how far you are from a third

924
00:30:32,140 --> 00:30:33,540
 and that tells you where you are.

925
00:30:33,540 --> 00:30:34,660
 - 'Cause that pinpoints you.

926
00:30:34,660 --> 00:30:36,100
 - Exactly, that pinpoints you.

927
00:30:36,100 --> 00:30:37,380
 And then there's a fourth one.

928
00:30:37,380 --> 00:30:39,020
 - Time. - And it's time.

929
00:30:39,020 --> 00:30:40,500
 Exactly, it's time.

930
00:30:40,500 --> 00:30:41,460
 - The fourth dimension.

931
00:30:41,460 --> 00:30:43,260
 We know where the suspect is.

932
00:30:43,260 --> 00:30:45,140
 (laughing)

933
00:30:45,140 --> 00:30:47,820
 - What about if we got there before it was a hole?

934
00:30:47,820 --> 00:30:50,580
 (laughing)

935
00:30:50,580 --> 00:30:54,100
 - And that's why GPS so often makes you late.

936
00:30:54,100 --> 00:30:54,980
 - So what is it, Anna?

937
00:30:54,980 --> 00:30:55,820
 What is it?

938
00:30:55,820 --> 00:30:56,660
 - It is time.

939
00:30:56,660 --> 00:31:01,220
 Basically, it's the fact that the clock in your Garmin

940
00:31:01,220 --> 00:31:03,220
 is shit, whereas the clock in all satellites

941
00:31:03,220 --> 00:31:04,060
 is an atomic clock.

942
00:31:04,060 --> 00:31:06,340
 They've in fact got four in case the first three cock up.

943
00:31:06,340 --> 00:31:08,220
 And so the fourth satellite is sort of acting

944
00:31:08,220 --> 00:31:09,780
 like a substitute clock.

945
00:31:09,780 --> 00:31:11,140
 - So I'm sure you're right.

946
00:31:11,140 --> 00:31:13,060
 I thought I had found out something different,

947
00:31:13,060 --> 00:31:14,580
 which is that it's your elevation.

948
00:31:14,580 --> 00:31:17,380
 It also is that, that's a complicated thing.

949
00:31:17,380 --> 00:31:18,220
 - Okay.

950
00:31:18,220 --> 00:31:20,340
 - Because the Earth, it's all spheres.

951
00:31:20,340 --> 00:31:23,300
 So actually, I think the other thing is that...

952
00:31:23,300 --> 00:31:24,300
 - It's all spheres.

953
00:31:24,300 --> 00:31:25,660
 Discuss.

954
00:31:25,660 --> 00:31:28,100
 Welcome to the Chinese civil service exams.

955
00:31:28,100 --> 00:31:29,780
 (laughing)

956
00:31:29,780 --> 00:31:31,300
 - Let me just check my pants.

957
00:31:31,300 --> 00:31:33,500
 (laughing)

958
00:31:33,500 --> 00:31:35,900
 - I know this, it's on my gusset, I'm sure of it.

959
00:31:35,900 --> 00:31:38,180
 - No, no, guys, please.

960
00:31:38,180 --> 00:31:39,340
 - That's so confused.

961
00:31:39,340 --> 00:31:40,180
 - Yeah.

962
00:31:40,180 --> 00:31:43,340
 - Why does GPS get it wrong sometimes then?

963
00:31:43,340 --> 00:31:44,620
 There's a whole Wikipedia article,

964
00:31:44,620 --> 00:31:46,180
 I saw called "Death by GPS."

965
00:31:46,180 --> 00:31:47,620
 - Okay, that is human error.

966
00:31:47,620 --> 00:31:49,980
 That is people following GPS when they shouldn't be,

967
00:31:49,980 --> 00:31:51,220
 when they can see there's a road in front of them

968
00:31:51,220 --> 00:31:53,940
 and the GPS has made an error about the terrain.

969
00:31:53,940 --> 00:31:55,220
 But that's more like a mapping error,

970
00:31:55,220 --> 00:31:56,220
 as far as I understand it.

971
00:31:56,220 --> 00:31:57,060
 - Okay.

972
00:31:57,060 --> 00:31:58,620
 - But there is a thing where in the early days of GPS,

973
00:31:58,620 --> 00:31:59,900
 you could either have good GPS,

974
00:31:59,900 --> 00:32:01,420
 which the American government had,

975
00:32:01,420 --> 00:32:02,620
 or you could have crap GPS,

976
00:32:02,620 --> 00:32:04,180
 which the rest of the world had,

977
00:32:04,180 --> 00:32:05,660
 apart from a few select allies.

978
00:32:05,660 --> 00:32:07,740
 And there was, it was called either,

979
00:32:07,740 --> 00:32:08,560
 what was it called?

980
00:32:08,560 --> 00:32:10,780
 Standard positioning service, crap GPS,

981
00:32:10,780 --> 00:32:12,620
 or GPS premium.

982
00:32:12,620 --> 00:32:13,660
 (laughing)

983
00:32:13,660 --> 00:32:15,620
 - Where you have to be an ally of a map.

984
00:32:15,620 --> 00:32:19,260
 - Club GPS, but just $3.99 a month,

985
00:32:19,260 --> 00:32:20,260
 (laughing)

986
00:32:20,260 --> 00:32:22,340
 will give you loads of extra content,

987
00:32:22,340 --> 00:32:24,260
 will give you more suspects to target.

988
00:32:24,260 --> 00:32:25,580
 (laughing)

989
00:32:25,580 --> 00:32:29,500
 Yeah, but it was because they didn't want hostile nations,

990
00:32:29,500 --> 00:32:31,400
 having access to the kind of pinpoint accuracy

991
00:32:31,400 --> 00:32:32,700
 that the US government had.

992
00:32:32,700 --> 00:32:35,140
 - I'm suddenly picturing me and my wife in a car

993
00:32:35,140 --> 00:32:36,380
 taking the wrong turn,

994
00:32:36,380 --> 00:32:38,860
 pummeling straight off the edge of a cliff,

995
00:32:38,860 --> 00:32:41,700
 and our last words being, should've gone premium.

996
00:32:41,700 --> 00:32:43,540
 (laughing)

997
00:32:43,540 --> 00:32:47,340
 Can I tell you about a GPS service from 1916?

998
00:32:47,340 --> 00:32:48,180
 - Oh yeah, wow.

999
00:32:48,180 --> 00:32:50,740
 - It was a Manhattan chauffeur called George Boyden,

1000
00:32:50,740 --> 00:32:53,300
 and he painted this new technique.

1001
00:32:53,300 --> 00:32:56,660
 And what it was, there would be a phonograph in your car,

1002
00:32:56,660 --> 00:33:00,060
 and it would play recordings, say turn left now,

1003
00:33:00,060 --> 00:33:02,740
 or turn right, or go straight on.

1004
00:33:02,740 --> 00:33:05,940
 And it would be attached to your wheels.

1005
00:33:05,940 --> 00:33:08,380
 And after you've got a certain distance,

1006
00:33:08,380 --> 00:33:11,140
 it would know to play turn left now.

1007
00:33:11,140 --> 00:33:11,980
 Isn't that clever?

1008
00:33:11,980 --> 00:33:13,060
 - That's incredible.

1009
00:33:13,060 --> 00:33:15,800
 - Well, obviously the problem is, if you miss one turning.

1010
00:33:15,800 --> 00:33:18,060
 (laughing)

1011
00:33:18,060 --> 00:33:20,640
 (upbeat music)

1012
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:26,060
 - We need to move on to our final fact of the show,

1013
00:33:26,060 --> 00:33:27,660
 and that is James.

1014
00:33:27,660 --> 00:33:28,740
 - Okay, my fact this week,

1015
00:33:28,740 --> 00:33:31,140
 is that playing ice hockey can make you talk

1016
00:33:31,140 --> 00:33:32,680
 in a Canadian accent.

1017
00:33:32,680 --> 00:33:35,580
 (laughing)

1018
00:33:35,580 --> 00:33:37,860
 - So, okay, so this is,

1019
00:33:37,860 --> 00:33:39,780
 you don't even need to be around Canadians,

1020
00:33:39,780 --> 00:33:41,540
 you just are, you've picked up your--

1021
00:33:41,540 --> 00:33:43,180
 - You don't need to be a boot them.

1022
00:33:43,180 --> 00:33:44,700
 (laughing)

1023
00:33:44,700 --> 00:33:46,540
 - God, that was a crowbar again.

1024
00:33:46,540 --> 00:33:47,660
 - That's literally the only word,

1025
00:33:47,660 --> 00:33:49,740
 like we've said this before, we came on stage early,

1026
00:33:49,740 --> 00:33:52,420
 I can't say any Canadian sounding words.

1027
00:33:52,420 --> 00:33:54,220
 - I think a boot is the only one anyone can,

1028
00:33:54,220 --> 00:33:55,420
 and you've hogged it now, so.

1029
00:33:55,420 --> 00:33:58,220
 - All right, so this is a linguist

1030
00:33:58,220 --> 00:34:01,060
 at the University of Rochester called Andrew Bray,

1031
00:34:01,060 --> 00:34:03,260
 and he started out by studying the evolution

1032
00:34:03,260 --> 00:34:07,220
 of hockey jargon, and then whenever he told anyone

1033
00:34:07,220 --> 00:34:09,220
 about the project, they kept saying to him,

1034
00:34:09,220 --> 00:34:11,220
 "Well, why don't you actually look at why American

1035
00:34:11,220 --> 00:34:14,140
 "hockey players start sounding like fake Canadians?"

1036
00:34:14,140 --> 00:34:17,300
 And he decided, "Yeah, why not, let's do that.

1037
00:34:17,300 --> 00:34:19,220
 "Everyone's asking it, I might as well."

1038
00:34:19,220 --> 00:34:22,380
 And so he's interviewed a lot of people,

1039
00:34:22,380 --> 00:34:24,860
 interviewed a lot of Americans, a lot of Canadians,

1040
00:34:24,860 --> 00:34:29,140
 and he found that up until about the age of 14,

1041
00:34:29,140 --> 00:34:31,700
 if you're American, you don't really sound that Canadian,

1042
00:34:31,700 --> 00:34:33,660
 but from then on, you really do start sounding

1043
00:34:33,660 --> 00:34:36,540
 more and more Canadian, and what he reckons is,

1044
00:34:36,540 --> 00:34:40,140
 you pick up hockey terms, like ice hockey slang,

1045
00:34:40,140 --> 00:34:41,900
 and you say that in a Canadian way,

1046
00:34:41,900 --> 00:34:43,980
 because that's what all your peers are saying,

1047
00:34:43,980 --> 00:34:47,260
 and it kind of seeps into the rest of your vocabulary.

1048
00:34:47,260 --> 00:34:50,580
 - What a Canadian, I'm thinking, Zamboni.

1049
00:34:50,580 --> 00:34:52,660
 - Oh, that's interesting, I think that was American,

1050
00:34:52,660 --> 00:34:56,220
 actually, but there was, let's say, for instance,

1051
00:34:56,220 --> 00:34:58,460
 a hockey arena is known as a barn,

1052
00:34:58,460 --> 00:35:02,380
 and a puck is known as a biscuit in Canadian terms.

1053
00:35:02,380 --> 00:35:04,580
 - Okay, and then the accent sort of follows along

1054
00:35:04,580 --> 00:35:05,420
 after the words.

1055
00:35:05,420 --> 00:35:06,660
 - Yeah, you pick up the odd word,

1056
00:35:06,660 --> 00:35:08,220
 and you say the odd word in that accent,

1057
00:35:08,220 --> 00:35:09,660
 and then slowly you just start saying

1058
00:35:09,660 --> 00:35:10,980
 more and more in that accent.

1059
00:35:10,980 --> 00:35:12,620
 - God, we're so impressionable,

1060
00:35:12,620 --> 00:35:14,300
 it's embarrassing, isn't it?

1061
00:35:14,300 --> 00:35:15,300
 - That's not about roles.

1062
00:35:15,300 --> 00:35:19,260
 You know, Gary Oldman, one of the most famous actors

1063
00:35:19,260 --> 00:35:21,140
 from Britain, he went over to America,

1064
00:35:21,140 --> 00:35:23,060
 and he does a lot of movies where he speaks

1065
00:35:23,060 --> 00:35:25,660
 in an English, sorry, in an American accent.

1066
00:35:25,660 --> 00:35:29,500
 When he moved back here, he had to have a language coach,

1067
00:35:29,500 --> 00:35:31,140
 and an accent coach, basically--

1068
00:35:31,140 --> 00:35:32,300
 - Language coach?

1069
00:35:32,300 --> 00:35:33,980
 What actor is that?

1070
00:35:33,980 --> 00:35:35,180
 - That's Canadian.

1071
00:35:35,180 --> 00:35:38,860
 Authentic.

1072
00:35:38,860 --> 00:35:39,700
 Wobbeck.

1073
00:35:39,700 --> 00:35:45,060
 So, yeah, he had to have someone to re-teach him.

1074
00:35:45,060 --> 00:35:46,740
 - Re-teach him his accent.

1075
00:35:46,740 --> 00:35:50,180
 - In Canadian English, there are interesting vowel shifts

1076
00:35:50,180 --> 00:35:51,900
 that they do, and I had never heard of any of this,

1077
00:35:51,900 --> 00:35:56,900
 but there's a boot, which they don't actually say a boot.

1078
00:35:56,900 --> 00:35:58,620
 If you listen to them closely, they say the,

1079
00:35:58,620 --> 00:36:00,860
 okay, I'm gonna try and explain this.

1080
00:36:00,860 --> 00:36:05,060
 When you say the about, ow, is too sound, right?

1081
00:36:05,060 --> 00:36:07,100
 It's ah, and then ooh.

1082
00:36:07,100 --> 00:36:07,940
 - Ow.

1083
00:36:07,940 --> 00:36:09,900
 - About.

1084
00:36:09,900 --> 00:36:10,860
 That's it, slow down.

1085
00:36:10,860 --> 00:36:12,700
 - Right.

1086
00:36:12,700 --> 00:36:16,020
 - What's that all about, and then ooh, right?

1087
00:36:16,020 --> 00:36:16,860
 - Yeah.

1088
00:36:16,860 --> 00:36:19,620
 - All right, Professor Higgins, move us on.

1089
00:36:19,620 --> 00:36:22,420
 - But in Canada, the diphthong, which is that bit of it,

1090
00:36:22,420 --> 00:36:25,100
 it starts with an exclusively Canadian sound

1091
00:36:25,100 --> 00:36:27,100
 that not only can most people not say,

1092
00:36:27,100 --> 00:36:29,340
 you can't even write it down in the--

1093
00:36:29,340 --> 00:36:30,300
 - Can you say it?

1094
00:36:30,300 --> 00:36:31,140
 - Well--

1095
00:36:31,140 --> 00:36:32,340
 - Can you try?

1096
00:36:32,340 --> 00:36:34,060
 - Starts with something like air,

1097
00:36:34,060 --> 00:36:35,540
 and it moves to something like ooh,

1098
00:36:35,540 --> 00:36:37,540
 but it's not a boat or a boot.

1099
00:36:37,540 --> 00:36:38,860
 - It's ow.

1100
00:36:38,860 --> 00:36:40,180
 - Well, exactly.

1101
00:36:40,180 --> 00:36:41,220
 - Do you know that King Charles

1102
00:36:41,220 --> 00:36:42,980
 is gonna start talking like Mr. T?

1103
00:36:42,980 --> 00:36:45,420
 - Mr. T?

1104
00:36:45,420 --> 00:36:46,260
 - What?

1105
00:36:46,260 --> 00:36:47,580
 - When?

1106
00:36:47,580 --> 00:36:50,780
 - Sometime in the future, this was a paper I was reading

1107
00:36:50,780 --> 00:36:53,540
 about something called the intrusive L,

1108
00:36:53,540 --> 00:36:56,380
 and it's the fact that people often drop their Ls,

1109
00:36:56,380 --> 00:36:59,180
 so Mr. T might say, I pity the fool.

1110
00:36:59,180 --> 00:37:00,020
 - Yeah.

1111
00:37:00,020 --> 00:37:02,820
 - They kind of hear the L, but he doesn't actually say it.

1112
00:37:02,820 --> 00:37:03,660
 - I pity the fool.

1113
00:37:03,660 --> 00:37:04,900
 - There's a few of things like people might say,

1114
00:37:04,900 --> 00:37:05,940
 cool, cool, cool, cool.

1115
00:37:05,940 --> 00:37:07,260
 But they don't actually say the L,

1116
00:37:07,260 --> 00:37:08,500
 they're just saying, ooh, really.

1117
00:37:08,500 --> 00:37:09,540
 - Oh, right.

1118
00:37:09,540 --> 00:37:10,380
 - If you say--

1119
00:37:10,380 --> 00:37:11,580
 - Like, fool fighters, right?

1120
00:37:11,580 --> 00:37:14,020
 That's, we call them, we call them.

1121
00:37:14,020 --> 00:37:15,900
 (laughing)

1122
00:37:15,900 --> 00:37:18,580
 - Yeah, or I'm just, I'm going to the zoo today.

1123
00:37:18,580 --> 00:37:19,420
 - Yeah.

1124
00:37:19,420 --> 00:37:20,340
 (laughing)

1125
00:37:20,340 --> 00:37:22,300
 - You know what, it's really interesting about that.

1126
00:37:22,300 --> 00:37:24,980
 So apparently, according to the paper that I said,

1127
00:37:24,980 --> 00:37:26,740
 it's basically an unstoppable trend,

1128
00:37:26,740 --> 00:37:28,180
 and even the British royal family

1129
00:37:28,180 --> 00:37:30,500
 is eventually going to speak like that.

1130
00:37:30,500 --> 00:37:33,020
 But the really interesting thing is in Bristol,

1131
00:37:33,020 --> 00:37:36,260
 they add an L, and they kind of overcompensate,

1132
00:37:36,260 --> 00:37:37,660
 they over-correct.

1133
00:37:37,660 --> 00:37:39,980
 They know that people often drop their Ls,

1134
00:37:39,980 --> 00:37:42,860
 and so they'll add Ls where they shouldn't really be one.

1135
00:37:42,860 --> 00:37:45,140
 And so there are some people in Bristol,

1136
00:37:45,140 --> 00:37:47,820
 mostly older people, who might, instead of saying idea,

1137
00:37:47,820 --> 00:37:51,140
 they'll say ideal, or they might say, instead of piano,

1138
00:37:51,140 --> 00:37:52,140
 they say piano.

1139
00:37:52,140 --> 00:37:52,980
 - Piano.

1140
00:37:52,980 --> 00:37:54,140
 - It's not exactly a full L,

1141
00:37:54,140 --> 00:37:55,780
 but it's kind of a slight L on it.

1142
00:37:55,780 --> 00:37:58,220
 - And your logic is that they're trying to,

1143
00:37:58,220 --> 00:38:00,020
 like there are lots of homeless Ls now,

1144
00:38:00,020 --> 00:38:01,900
 that have been dropped of other people's speech,

1145
00:38:01,900 --> 00:38:04,820
 and the good people of Bristol are trying to re-home them.

1146
00:38:04,820 --> 00:38:06,260
 - Are they going to be the last people

1147
00:38:06,260 --> 00:38:07,980
 to stand against the disappearing L?

1148
00:38:07,980 --> 00:38:09,580
 - Well, presumably there'll be some other people

1149
00:38:09,580 --> 00:38:11,260
 who kind of overcompensate as well.

1150
00:38:11,260 --> 00:38:13,820
 But this is true, and it's so true in Bristol,

1151
00:38:13,820 --> 00:38:17,460
 that the city of Bristol was originally called Brixto,

1152
00:38:17,460 --> 00:38:21,020
 and the people of Bristol started saying Brixto,

1153
00:38:21,020 --> 00:38:22,980
 and they added the L to Brixto,

1154
00:38:22,980 --> 00:38:24,180
 and that's how they got the name.

1155
00:38:24,180 --> 00:38:27,420
 So the name of the entire city comes from this overcompensator

1156
00:38:27,420 --> 00:38:29,340
 and adding Ls at the end of words.

1157
00:38:29,340 --> 00:38:30,820
 - Oh my God.

1158
00:38:30,820 --> 00:38:31,660
 - Isn't that cool?

1159
00:38:31,660 --> 00:38:33,580
 - Overcompensating for what, though?

1160
00:38:33,580 --> 00:38:35,540
 - Yeah, all right, it's lovely, Bristol.

1161
00:38:35,540 --> 00:38:36,740
 - You literally just explained it,

1162
00:38:36,740 --> 00:38:38,660
 but it's still worth saying.

1163
00:38:38,660 --> 00:38:40,740
 - It's the thing that I do of adding Rs,

1164
00:38:40,740 --> 00:38:41,580
 where they don't belong.

1165
00:38:41,580 --> 00:38:42,420
 - Oh, no, no.

1166
00:38:42,420 --> 00:38:43,620
 - Americans do.

1167
00:38:43,620 --> 00:38:46,340
 - But no American says Chicago, which is what I say.

1168
00:38:46,340 --> 00:38:47,180
 - No, no, no one does.

1169
00:38:47,180 --> 00:38:50,660
 - But you have an international accent that's sort of--

1170
00:38:50,660 --> 00:38:53,020
 - I would say some Bristolians might say that.

1171
00:38:53,020 --> 00:38:53,860
 - Chicago?

1172
00:38:53,860 --> 00:38:57,300
 - But again, not like that.

1173
00:38:57,300 --> 00:38:58,380
 Never like that.

1174
00:38:58,380 --> 00:39:01,380
 - It's a very different musical.

1175
00:39:01,380 --> 00:39:07,620
 - Yeah, she was right to shoot him, yeah.

1176
00:39:07,620 --> 00:39:10,340
 - Name me a vowel.

1177
00:39:10,340 --> 00:39:11,180
 Just name a vowel.

1178
00:39:11,180 --> 00:39:12,460
 - Oh, I can't think of any now.

1179
00:39:12,460 --> 00:39:13,300
 - Hi.

1180
00:39:13,300 --> 00:39:14,260
 - Hi, brilliant, one.

1181
00:39:14,260 --> 00:39:15,100
 - Yur.

1182
00:39:15,100 --> 00:39:18,020
 - You, you, I, you, okay.

1183
00:39:18,020 --> 00:39:18,860
 - E.

1184
00:39:18,860 --> 00:39:19,700
 - E.

1185
00:39:19,700 --> 00:39:21,700
 - I mean, we know the five.

1186
00:39:21,700 --> 00:39:22,540
 - O.

1187
00:39:22,540 --> 00:39:23,380
 - And A.

1188
00:39:23,380 --> 00:39:24,460
 - A, brilliant.

1189
00:39:24,460 --> 00:39:26,300
 - Where's the sixth?

1190
00:39:26,300 --> 00:39:27,140
 - There's a sixth one.

1191
00:39:27,140 --> 00:39:28,100
 - Y?

1192
00:39:28,100 --> 00:39:29,900
 - Nope, it's not Y.

1193
00:39:29,900 --> 00:39:30,740
 - Oh.

1194
00:39:30,740 --> 00:39:31,580
 - Is it R?

1195
00:39:31,580 --> 00:39:32,420
 - R.

1196
00:39:32,420 --> 00:39:37,220
 - Get this, R, technically, is a vowel.

1197
00:39:37,220 --> 00:39:38,780
 It's the secret sixth vowel.

1198
00:39:38,780 --> 00:39:39,860
 What's a consonant, right?

1199
00:39:39,860 --> 00:39:41,540
 You are closing something off in your mouth.

1200
00:39:41,540 --> 00:39:43,860
 You're using your lips or your teeth or your tongue,

1201
00:39:43,860 --> 00:39:45,740
 and you are closing something off.

1202
00:39:45,740 --> 00:39:48,940
 F, or, someone just said, I agree, out of nowhere.

1203
00:39:48,940 --> 00:39:52,340
 Right, that's what a consonant is,

1204
00:39:52,340 --> 00:39:54,660
 but a vowel, you're an open tube.

1205
00:39:54,660 --> 00:39:55,780
 Your mouth is an open tube.

1206
00:39:55,780 --> 00:39:56,620
 - Okay.

1207
00:39:56,620 --> 00:39:59,300
 - And you are, you're changing the shape of the tube,

1208
00:39:59,300 --> 00:40:03,700
 but it's like, A, E, I, O, U.

1209
00:40:03,700 --> 00:40:05,420
 They're all, the tube is open,

1210
00:40:05,420 --> 00:40:08,060
 and R is the same.

1211
00:40:08,060 --> 00:40:08,900
 - Right.

1212
00:40:08,900 --> 00:40:10,860
 What's the really cool Spanish one where they say,

1213
00:40:10,860 --> 00:40:12,180
 (speaking foreign language)

1214
00:40:12,180 --> 00:40:13,020
 - That thing.

1215
00:40:13,020 --> 00:40:16,980
 - We are wandering dangerously close.

1216
00:40:16,980 --> 00:40:18,060
 - Well, no, I can't do it,

1217
00:40:18,060 --> 00:40:19,900
 and it's so exciting every time I hit it.

1218
00:40:19,900 --> 00:40:21,740
 - What is, what is it?

1219
00:40:21,740 --> 00:40:23,660
 - You mean where they kind of lisp the lips?

1220
00:40:23,660 --> 00:40:25,020
 - Yeah, like, mythically.

1221
00:40:25,020 --> 00:40:26,940
 - There was a theory that that was,

1222
00:40:26,940 --> 00:40:29,300
 that people were trying to copy a king, wasn't it?

1223
00:40:29,300 --> 00:40:30,140
 - Really?

1224
00:40:30,140 --> 00:40:31,900
 - One of the kings supposedly had a lisp.

1225
00:40:31,900 --> 00:40:33,900
 - Every time I hear it, I just think that's such talent.

1226
00:40:33,900 --> 00:40:35,860
 - I think, I feel like that was a while ago,

1227
00:40:35,860 --> 00:40:38,820
 but speaking of people talking in an offensive manner,

1228
00:40:38,820 --> 00:40:42,100
 (audience laughing)

1229
00:40:42,100 --> 00:40:43,900
 and speaking of fake accents,

1230
00:40:43,900 --> 00:40:47,140
 in the 1800s, late 1800s, early 1900s,

1231
00:40:47,140 --> 00:40:50,260
 wealthier people used to throw poverty parties

1232
00:40:50,260 --> 00:40:52,220
 and call them poverty parties.

1233
00:40:52,220 --> 00:40:54,220
 And the invitations would say,

1234
00:40:54,220 --> 00:40:57,220
 you are only allowed to wear rags and sacks

1235
00:40:57,220 --> 00:41:00,420
 and your worst cloth and will only be served,

1236
00:41:00,420 --> 00:41:01,940
 I think it was just an excuse not to serve

1237
00:41:01,940 --> 00:41:03,780
 expensive canapes, it was like,

1238
00:41:03,780 --> 00:41:06,740
 we will only serve stale bread and water.

1239
00:41:06,740 --> 00:41:10,820
 And people would come and put on working class accents.

1240
00:41:10,820 --> 00:41:12,380
 So this was a fashionable thing,

1241
00:41:12,380 --> 00:41:13,620
 and there were lots of invitations.

1242
00:41:13,620 --> 00:41:15,940
 And Irish especially, it was in America.

1243
00:41:15,940 --> 00:41:19,260
 And so an Irish accent was seen to be quite working class,

1244
00:41:19,260 --> 00:41:21,220
 full of Irish immigrants at the time,

1245
00:41:21,220 --> 00:41:23,380
 and posh people turned up to parties

1246
00:41:23,380 --> 00:41:26,500
 and had to speak the whole night in an Irish accent.

1247
00:41:26,500 --> 00:41:27,340
 - Wow.

1248
00:41:27,340 --> 00:41:29,020
 - That's a full party of canceled people.

1249
00:41:29,020 --> 00:41:29,860
 - Yeah, that's amazing.

1250
00:41:29,860 --> 00:41:30,700
 - Right there.

1251
00:41:30,700 --> 00:41:31,540
 - That is weird.

1252
00:41:31,540 --> 00:41:32,380
 - Yeah.

1253
00:41:32,380 --> 00:41:33,820
 - Garcia, Garcia.

1254
00:41:33,820 --> 00:41:34,820
 - You've been letting him.

1255
00:41:34,820 --> 00:41:36,180
 (audience laughing)

1256
00:41:36,180 --> 00:41:39,100
 - Your invoice in the post, Dan, you're already in.

1257
00:41:39,100 --> 00:41:40,820
 - Do you know somewhere where you can be killed

1258
00:41:40,820 --> 00:41:42,580
 for doing the wrong accent?

1259
00:41:42,580 --> 00:41:43,420
 - The dance chair.

1260
00:41:43,420 --> 00:41:46,940
 (audience laughing)

1261
00:41:46,940 --> 00:41:49,980
 - This is the ant nest beetle.

1262
00:41:49,980 --> 00:41:52,700
 And it is a beetle that goes into ants nests

1263
00:41:52,700 --> 00:41:56,780
 and is able to mimic the ants chemical signatures.

1264
00:41:56,780 --> 00:41:59,220
 But it's able to do lots of different ones.

1265
00:41:59,220 --> 00:42:01,300
 And so if you're an ant that lives over here

1266
00:42:01,300 --> 00:42:02,380
 or one that lives over here,

1267
00:42:02,380 --> 00:42:03,620
 or maybe another species of ant,

1268
00:42:03,620 --> 00:42:05,700
 it can change it very, very slightly.

1269
00:42:05,700 --> 00:42:08,620
 So it gets all the different dialects of ant.

1270
00:42:08,620 --> 00:42:10,860
 And if it gets it even slightly wrong,

1271
00:42:10,860 --> 00:42:12,540
 the ants will kill them and eat them.

1272
00:42:12,540 --> 00:42:13,380
 - Really?

1273
00:42:13,380 --> 00:42:14,620
 - Oh, that's incredible.

1274
00:42:14,620 --> 00:42:16,380
 - Even it's just like saying tomato

1275
00:42:16,380 --> 00:42:17,460
 instead of tomato.

1276
00:42:17,460 --> 00:42:18,800
 - Tomato.

1277
00:42:18,800 --> 00:42:20,900
 - So they can't get drunk at all.

1278
00:42:20,900 --> 00:42:21,740
 - No.

1279
00:42:21,740 --> 00:42:24,020
 - Accidentally drop a tea and that's it.

1280
00:42:24,020 --> 00:42:24,860
 Well, that's pretty interesting

1281
00:42:24,860 --> 00:42:26,580
 because there's a lot of talk

1282
00:42:26,580 --> 00:42:28,940
 about whether animals have accents or not.

1283
00:42:28,940 --> 00:42:30,180
 - It's always claimed, right?

1284
00:42:30,180 --> 00:42:32,380
 - What the definition of an accent is.

1285
00:42:32,380 --> 00:42:35,460
 And there was a big story that went around about cows

1286
00:42:35,460 --> 00:42:38,940
 having regional accents a few years ago.

1287
00:42:38,940 --> 00:42:41,860
 - Ducks as well having regional accents.

1288
00:42:41,860 --> 00:42:45,180
 - Well, I think that had more truth to it in 2006.

1289
00:42:45,180 --> 00:42:46,620
 And I think we might have said this

1290
00:42:46,620 --> 00:42:47,740
 'cause it was reported everywhere.

1291
00:42:47,740 --> 00:42:50,540
 It was reported that cows moo in regional accents.

1292
00:42:50,540 --> 00:42:53,740
 And it turns out that was just a big PR thing

1293
00:42:53,740 --> 00:42:56,260
 from West Country Farmhouse Cheese Makers

1294
00:42:56,260 --> 00:42:58,100
 - Really?

1295
00:42:58,100 --> 00:42:59,740
 - To try and sell more cheese.

1296
00:42:59,740 --> 00:43:03,020
 So, and they quoted this professor, John Wells,

1297
00:43:03,020 --> 00:43:05,060
 who was a professor of phonetics at UCL,

1298
00:43:05,060 --> 00:43:08,780
 who kept on saying, "I never said this."

1299
00:43:08,780 --> 00:43:10,780
 These cheese guys called me and they said,

1300
00:43:10,780 --> 00:43:12,780
 "Do you think cows moo in regional accents?"

1301
00:43:12,780 --> 00:43:15,580
 And he said, "I think it's incredibly unlikely."

1302
00:43:15,580 --> 00:43:18,060
 And they kept on saying, "But is it possible?"

1303
00:43:18,060 --> 00:43:22,420
 And he said, "Well, birds do exhibit regional variants."

1304
00:43:22,420 --> 00:43:23,940
 Yep, we'll take that as a yes.

1305
00:43:23,940 --> 00:43:27,500
 - Oh my God, his career has presumably been ruined.

1306
00:43:27,500 --> 00:43:29,100
 No one's talking to him.

1307
00:43:29,100 --> 00:43:30,220
 None of the cows are talking to him

1308
00:43:30,220 --> 00:43:31,540
 at any of the conferences.

1309
00:43:31,540 --> 00:43:36,100
 Do you know what the most attractive accent is?

1310
00:43:36,100 --> 00:43:37,940
 And this is a physiological thing.

1311
00:43:37,940 --> 00:43:38,780
 - Oh, okay.

1312
00:43:38,780 --> 00:43:41,060
 - What makes your heart go pitter-patter?

1313
00:43:41,060 --> 00:43:42,660
 - Well, we've all got opinions.

1314
00:43:42,660 --> 00:43:43,500
 - Wow.

1315
00:43:43,500 --> 00:43:44,580
 - A Barcelona.

1316
00:43:44,580 --> 00:43:47,580
 (audience laughing)

1317
00:43:47,580 --> 00:43:54,260
 - Yeah, that's, oh.

1318
00:43:54,260 --> 00:43:56,820
 - I'm feeling warm, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1319
00:43:56,820 --> 00:43:59,300
 - Used to be an attractive accent.

1320
00:43:59,300 --> 00:44:02,100
 - I think this was a study of European accents,

1321
00:44:02,100 --> 00:44:03,140
 in particular, done by--

1322
00:44:03,140 --> 00:44:05,140
 - Most people would say French, right?

1323
00:44:05,140 --> 00:44:05,980
 - Most people would say French.

1324
00:44:05,980 --> 00:44:08,140
 And this was an online language tutor called Preply.

1325
00:44:08,140 --> 00:44:10,420
 They attached heart rate monitors to 1,000 adults

1326
00:44:10,420 --> 00:44:13,060
 and they played them pre-recorded chat-up lines.

1327
00:44:13,060 --> 00:44:14,900
 I presume the same in every language.

1328
00:44:14,900 --> 00:44:15,820
 - Yeah, right.

1329
00:44:15,820 --> 00:44:17,540
 - And it found that being chatted up

1330
00:44:17,540 --> 00:44:21,060
 in an Italian accent makes men and women's heart rates

1331
00:44:21,060 --> 00:44:22,660
 rise by 23%.

1332
00:44:22,660 --> 00:44:23,500
 - Really?

1333
00:44:23,500 --> 00:44:24,340
 - 15 beats a minute higher

1334
00:44:24,340 --> 00:44:27,700
 if you're getting that sweet, sweet Italian telling up.

1335
00:44:27,700 --> 00:44:29,180
 - That's a lot of beats, actually.

1336
00:44:29,180 --> 00:44:30,700
 - Come and stay with my mother.

1337
00:44:30,700 --> 00:44:31,540
 - No.

1338
00:44:31,540 --> 00:44:34,460
 (audience laughing)

1339
00:44:34,460 --> 00:44:35,780
 - That's nice.

1340
00:44:35,780 --> 00:44:38,020
 - So you actually ruined an entire nation for me.

1341
00:44:38,020 --> 00:44:39,180
 (audience laughing)

1342
00:44:39,180 --> 00:44:40,020
 - I am.

1343
00:44:40,020 --> 00:44:41,140
 - I'm gonna need to move a song.

1344
00:44:41,140 --> 00:44:41,980
 - What?

1345
00:44:41,980 --> 00:44:42,820
 - Yeah, I'm afraid.

1346
00:44:42,820 --> 00:44:43,660
 - You're done.

1347
00:44:43,660 --> 00:44:44,660
 - English is the least sexy, sorry.

1348
00:44:44,660 --> 00:44:45,500
 - Okay.

1349
00:44:45,500 --> 00:44:46,340
 (audience laughing)

1350
00:44:46,340 --> 00:44:47,180
 - Well, come and see my mother.

1351
00:44:47,180 --> 00:44:49,300
 (audience laughing)

1352
00:44:49,300 --> 00:44:52,300
 (audience clapping)

1353
00:44:52,300 --> 00:44:57,680
 (upbeat music)

1354
00:44:57,680 --> 00:45:01,860
 - All right, listen, we need to wrap up our show.

1355
00:45:01,860 --> 00:45:03,020
 Okay, that is it.

1356
00:45:03,020 --> 00:45:04,020
 That is all of our facts.

1357
00:45:04,020 --> 00:45:05,460

 There's also links to the secret club, Clubfish.

1375

 No one has checked that out yet, do check that out.

1376
00:45:39,460 --> 00:45:40,700
 And of course, we're gonna be on tour.

1377
00:45:40,700 --> 00:45:43,900
 We're going around a lot of bits of the earth

1378
00:45:43,900 --> 00:45:45,940
 and we are gonna have fun dorking out

1379
00:45:45,940 --> 00:45:47,940
 for our 10th year with Thunder Nerds.

1380
00:45:47,940 --> 00:45:50,340
 Thank you so much, everyone, for coming here tonight.

1381

00:45:52,940 --> 00:45:54,060
 We'll see you again.

1384
00:45:54,060 --> 00:45:54,900
 Goodbye!
