00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.080
 (upbeat music)

00:00:03.080 --> 00:00:04.680
 - Hi everyone, welcome to this week's episode

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:06.240
 of "No such thing as a fish,"

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:09.160
 which we recorded at the Underbelly Theatre

00:00:09.160 --> 00:00:11.400
 in London's Soho.

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:16.400
 It was the first try at our brand new touring show,

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:19.400
 but we did a full podcast in the middle of that show.

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:21.720
 If you would like to see all of the other bits and bobs

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:23.000
 that we will do on tour,

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.080
 then you'll have to go and get tickets,

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:29.480
 and you can get those at nosagethingsafish.com/live.

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:31.640
 At this place, you can also learn

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:34.520
 about our upcoming trip to Gothenburg.

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:37.200
 We will be playing the Gothenburg Book Festival

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:39.760
 on the 27th of September.

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:42.280
 That will be a simple podcast recording,

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:44.840
 but if you want to see all the other bells and whistles,

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:48.360
 including quizzes and special guests,

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:50.440
 and Andy probably talking nonsense

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:52.400
 about a very obscure subject,

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:54.640
 then you will have to come to one of our other shows

00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:57.720
 in Bristol, Dublin, Glasgow, Newcastle, Cardiff, London,

00:00:57.720 --> 00:00:59.280
 or Manchester.

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:01.280
 Again, details for all of these shows

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:04.480
 are at nosagethingsafish.com/live.

00:01:04.480 --> 00:01:07.160
 We'll also do some shows in Australia and New Zealand,

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:10.120
 but they are, frankly, almost all sold out.

00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:12.080
 If you beg, borrow, and steal,

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:14.120
 you might be able to find one or two tickets

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:16.280
 in Perth and Christchurch.

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:17.960
 I think there might be one or two

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:21.520
 in our second additional show in Sydney,

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:22.840
 but if you are living down under,

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:24.960
 then really you should try and get those tickets

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:25.800
 as soon as possible,

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:28.920
 because they are virtually sold out.

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:31.680
 While I'm here, it would be remiss of me not to remind you

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:33.600
 that we've all written lots of books.

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:36.680
 Anna and I have written a book called A Load of Old Balls.

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:39.640
 Dan has got a book called The Theory of Everything Else,

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:42.840
 as well as a kids book called Impossible Things,

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:46.000
 and he has written novels, The Last Day, The Century,

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:47.800
 A Beginner's Guide to Breaking and Entering

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:49.120
 is his latest one.

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:50.520
 If you're looking for something to read

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:52.280
 over the remaining part of summer,

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:55.280
 or indeed as the nights begin to draw in,

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:57.120
 then please do consider getting our books,

00:01:57.120 --> 00:01:59.760
 because it makes us, and indeed our publishers,

00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:01.720
 very happy when you do so.

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:03.880
 Anyway, enough of trying to sell you stuff.

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:06.840
 The podcast is free, and of course, we'll always be free.

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:09.840
 And so please do enjoy this free podcast,

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:13.880
 recorded live at the Underbelly Theatre in Soho.

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:15.720
 Okay, on with the podcast.

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:24.560
 - There we go.

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:27.160
 (upbeat music)

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:34.760
 - Hello, and welcome to another episode

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:37.680
 of No Such Thing as a Fish, a weekly podcast,

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:39.040
 this week coming to you live

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:41.400
 from the Underbelly Boulevard in Soho.

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:44.400
 (audience cheering)

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:48.760
 - My name is Dan Schreiber.

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:50.600
 I am sitting here with Anna Tyshinski,

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:52.760
 Andrew Hunter Murray, and James Harkin.

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:54.880
 And once again, we have gathered around the microphones

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:57.560
 with our four favorite facts from the last seven days,

00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:00.240
 and in no particular order, here we go,

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:03.440
 starting with fact number one, and that is Anna.

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:05.960
 - My fact this week is that Chinese students

00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:09.720
 in the 1700s could rent underwear with test answers on it

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:12.320
 to smuggle into exam halls.

00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:13.280
 - Wow.

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:14.720
 Do you say rent?

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:16.240
 (audience laughing)

00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:18.120
 - If there are rental shops that are doing this,

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:19.960
 surely the schools would be aware

00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:21.920
 that that was a thing, right?

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:23.600
 - I think people were aware,

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:26.440
 but the cheaters kept on getting smarter and smarter.

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:27.440
 That's the thing about cheaters.

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:30.440
 They can always outwit the boring law abiders.

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:34.080
 This is in the civil service exams,

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:36.760
 very famous Chinese civil service exams,

00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:40.520
 by far the oldest meritocratic system in the world,

00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:43.680
 going since the seventh century.

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:45.700
 This exam is extremely hard to pass,

00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:46.760
 but if you did pass it,

00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:48.400
 you could be in the Chinese civil service.

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:49.820
 It was very prestigious.

00:03:49.820 --> 00:03:53.800
 The exam's basically unchanged for 1500 years,

00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:56.680
 and throughout the period that existed

00:03:56.680 --> 00:04:00.200
 from the seventh century to the start of the 20th century,

00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:02.360
 there are these amazing stories of how people cheated.

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:03.200
 - I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:06.120
 If it's unchanged for 1500 years, I think I could pass.

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:07.800
 (audience laughing)

00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:08.640
 - Oh yeah, Randy.

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:11.040
 We're looking at a picture of a shirt.

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:12.160
 (audience laughing)

00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:14.040
 I would like to see you memorize that,

00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:15.680
 even if it was in English.

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:19.400
 It's unbelievably tiny characters on this vest, isn't it?

00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:20.300
 - Yeah.

00:04:20.300 --> 00:04:22.460
 - It is, and this is one of the cheating garments.

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:24.700
 So these things were called cribbing garments.

00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:27.740
 And yeah, so there's evidence in the 1700s

00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:31.340
 of underwear made of paper with essays written on it.

00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:33.220
 Or, it's--

00:04:33.220 --> 00:04:34.980
 - Well, that says to me that what you can do

00:04:34.980 --> 00:04:38.180
 is just sort of remove one sheet at a time and hand it in.

00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:39.740
 (audience laughing)

00:04:39.740 --> 00:04:41.260
 - Surely you'd have to be rummaging around

00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:43.700
 in your undergarments to get the answers that you need,

00:04:43.700 --> 00:04:45.700
 'cause what you'd need is to learn a lot of Confucius.

00:04:45.700 --> 00:04:47.020
 That's basically what the exam is, isn't it?

00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:49.340
 You have to memorize 400,000 characters.

00:04:49.340 --> 00:04:50.220
 - Lots of learning by rote.

00:04:50.220 --> 00:04:51.240
 Michael Gove would have loved it.

00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:52.080
 - Yeah.

00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:53.480
 (audience laughing)

00:04:53.480 --> 00:04:54.760
 - It's just bizarre for all in the system.

00:04:54.760 --> 00:04:56.500
 They were so rigorous about catching cheaters.

00:04:56.500 --> 00:04:58.640
 They stripped, actually, they did everything,

00:04:58.640 --> 00:05:01.420
 but they then put you in an enclosed cubicle

00:05:01.420 --> 00:05:03.600
 for a few days to do the exam.

00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:04.640
 And in that enclosed cubicle,

00:05:04.640 --> 00:05:06.160
 you suddenly were about your underwear,

00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:08.160
 or the things you could actually rent

00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:10.040
 were little scripts that you were meant to sew

00:05:10.040 --> 00:05:12.440
 into your underwear or into your underclothes

00:05:12.440 --> 00:05:13.640
 with the test answers on them,

00:05:13.640 --> 00:05:16.120
 but it was absolutely tiny, the writing.

00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:18.340
 I think there was one which contained

00:05:18.340 --> 00:05:20.660
 722 finished compositions,

00:05:20.660 --> 00:05:23.340
 which was 520,000 characters,

00:05:23.340 --> 00:05:25.720
 and it was just in the underlining of the shirt.

00:05:25.720 --> 00:05:27.660
 - It's because basically it was a question.

00:05:27.660 --> 00:05:29.420
 You knew what the question was gonna be,

00:05:29.420 --> 00:05:31.060
 and you knew what the answer was,

00:05:31.060 --> 00:05:33.020
 but the test was, can you remember the answer?

00:05:33.020 --> 00:05:33.860
 - Right.

00:05:33.860 --> 00:05:34.700
 - And it's really long.

00:05:34.700 --> 00:05:35.680
 - Oh, it's a pure repetition.

00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:36.660
 - Pretty much, yeah.

00:05:36.660 --> 00:05:37.500
 - It's not right.

00:05:37.500 --> 00:05:39.180
 - And those, and that tiny, tiny writing

00:05:39.180 --> 00:05:40.860
 is what they use today to make the labels

00:05:40.860 --> 00:05:43.260
 with the washing instructions that go into your--

00:05:43.260 --> 00:05:44.100
 - It's not so.

00:05:44.100 --> 00:05:44.940
 - That's true.

00:05:44.940 --> 00:05:45.780
 - Is it?

00:05:45.780 --> 00:05:48.400
 - So they locked you away for three days?

00:05:48.400 --> 00:05:49.240
 - They did, yeah, yeah.

00:05:49.240 --> 00:05:50.100
 - Did you do the exam?

00:05:50.100 --> 00:05:52.020
 - Yeah, and you were very much locked.

00:05:52.020 --> 00:05:53.360
 - Could you take food and drink it?

00:05:53.360 --> 00:05:55.680
 - Yes, you bought your own little packed lunch, is?

00:05:55.680 --> 00:05:58.340
 - Well, I would write on a sausage my answers.

00:05:58.340 --> 00:05:59.180
 You know?

00:05:59.180 --> 00:06:01.420
 - Yeah, if the evidence after, right?

00:06:01.420 --> 00:06:03.100
 They can find it.

00:06:03.100 --> 00:06:05.580
 - Why are you bringing such an enormously long sausage

00:06:05.580 --> 00:06:07.540
 into the exam, Andy?

00:06:07.540 --> 00:06:10.080
 Well, thanks for asking.

00:06:10.080 --> 00:06:14.520
 And the room where you were, at least one of them,

00:06:14.520 --> 00:06:17.420
 this is the examination hall in Jiangnan,

00:06:17.420 --> 00:06:18.580
 you had your little room,

00:06:18.580 --> 00:06:19.840
 and there was lots of different rooms,

00:06:19.840 --> 00:06:21.820
 and then there was sort of an outer corridor,

00:06:21.820 --> 00:06:25.180
 and then it was surrounded by walls full of thorns

00:06:25.180 --> 00:06:27.580
 so that no one could come in and give you the answers.

00:06:27.580 --> 00:06:28.900
 - Wow.

00:06:28.900 --> 00:06:29.740
 - That is clever.

00:06:29.740 --> 00:06:31.660
 - And yeah, people kept outwitting it.

00:06:31.660 --> 00:06:32.500
 - Yeah?

00:06:32.500 --> 00:06:34.380
 - No one's ever gone to such great lengths to stop cheats,

00:06:34.380 --> 00:06:36.220
 and it just made the cheats better and better.

00:06:36.220 --> 00:06:38.140
 They used the dig tunnels underneath,

00:06:38.140 --> 00:06:40.540
 and then deliver notes to the students.

00:06:40.540 --> 00:06:41.380
 - Really?

00:06:41.380 --> 00:06:42.500
 - You must have had to be so precise

00:06:42.500 --> 00:06:44.500
 to get the exact cubicle that the student was in.

00:06:44.500 --> 00:06:46.440
 There's tens of thousands of people.

00:06:46.440 --> 00:06:48.440
 You just pop up in a stranger's cubicle.

00:06:48.440 --> 00:06:51.080
 - He's taking a shit while you're throwing up.

00:06:51.080 --> 00:06:53.340
 - I've actually written the answers on this shit.

00:06:53.340 --> 00:06:56.120
 (laughter)

00:06:56.120 --> 00:06:57.760
 - Well, it sounds like it hasn't changed, though, right?

00:06:57.760 --> 00:07:00.080
 Because modern China, I think it's still the case

00:07:00.080 --> 00:07:02.880
 that every year around 9.1 million high school students

00:07:02.880 --> 00:07:05.600
 are doing exams to go into university,

00:07:05.600 --> 00:07:08.040
 and it's a nightmare getting them to the exams.

00:07:08.040 --> 00:07:09.320
 Like, that's one of the biggest things

00:07:09.320 --> 00:07:11.200
 because everyone's really on edge.

00:07:11.200 --> 00:07:12.280
 You've got to get them from home there.

00:07:12.280 --> 00:07:14.740
 So, like, on days where the exams are happening,

00:07:14.740 --> 00:07:16.940
 there'll be very specific traffic lanes

00:07:16.940 --> 00:07:19.180
 that are purely for students taking exams.

00:07:19.180 --> 00:07:21.140
 Yeah, the families can drive them in.

00:07:21.140 --> 00:07:23.620
 So, it's like, yeah, exam day, this is the lane.

00:07:23.620 --> 00:07:25.540
 Express lane, purely for students.

00:07:25.540 --> 00:07:26.380
 - That's cool.

00:07:26.380 --> 00:07:27.220
 - Yeah.

00:07:27.220 --> 00:07:30.820
 - So, Dan, you grew up in Hong Kong, partly.

00:07:30.820 --> 00:07:32.460
 I know you weren't probably there with the edge

00:07:32.460 --> 00:07:33.660
 that you would have been taking these exams,

00:07:33.660 --> 00:07:36.580
 and you weren't trying to get into the Chinese civil service.

00:07:36.580 --> 00:07:37.660
 - You didn't know that?

00:07:37.660 --> 00:07:38.580
 - I mean, you're here now,

00:07:38.580 --> 00:07:40.940
 so things weren't pretty badly wrong.

00:07:40.940 --> 00:07:42.200
 (laughing)

00:07:42.200 --> 00:07:43.520
 - At last.

00:07:43.520 --> 00:07:44.340
 - Yeah.

00:07:44.340 --> 00:07:47.280
 (laughing)

00:07:47.280 --> 00:07:48.720
 - That is deep cover.

00:07:48.720 --> 00:07:51.280
 (laughing)

00:07:51.280 --> 00:07:54.160
 - Did you ever get the advice from your parents

00:07:54.160 --> 00:07:55.940
 of if you do badly, your mother will die

00:07:55.940 --> 00:07:57.280
 in a pauper's grave?

00:07:57.280 --> 00:07:58.680
 Did they ever say that to you?

00:07:58.680 --> 00:07:59.680
 - Well, my mum and dad are here.

00:07:59.680 --> 00:08:01.920
 Did you ever say that to me?

00:08:01.920 --> 00:08:04.080
 - No, apparently not, yeah.

00:08:04.080 --> 00:08:06.400
 - And where has that come from, that advice?

00:08:06.400 --> 00:08:07.240
 - Apparently, as they're saying,

00:08:07.240 --> 00:08:09.280
 sometimes that Chinese high schoolers

00:08:09.280 --> 00:08:11.100
 with especially straight parents get told.

00:08:11.100 --> 00:08:11.940
 - Wow.

00:08:11.940 --> 00:08:13.100
 Do you wanna hear some of the questions

00:08:13.100 --> 00:08:15.700
 from modern day Chinese civil service exams?

00:08:15.700 --> 00:08:16.540
 - Yeah. - Wow.

00:08:16.540 --> 00:08:18.860
 - Actually, these are to get into

00:08:18.860 --> 00:08:20.300
 the next level of schooling.

00:08:20.300 --> 00:08:21.140
 - Okay.

00:08:21.140 --> 00:08:22.580
 - I like university kind of thing.

00:08:22.580 --> 00:08:25.020
 The containers for milk are always square boxes.

00:08:25.020 --> 00:08:28.180
 Containers for mineral water are always round bottles.

00:08:28.180 --> 00:08:31.660
 Round wine bottles are usually placed in square boxes.

00:08:31.660 --> 00:08:34.180
 Write a composition on the subtle philosophy

00:08:34.180 --> 00:08:35.800
 of round and square.

00:08:35.800 --> 00:08:38.060
 (laughing)

00:08:38.160 --> 00:08:40.640
 - Um, no, I do know this one.

00:08:40.640 --> 00:08:43.040
 (laughing)

00:08:43.040 --> 00:08:44.240
 Is that a modern, that's the one one?

00:08:44.240 --> 00:08:45.080
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:08:45.080 --> 00:08:45.920
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:08:45.920 --> 00:08:46.760
 - Oh, I did that one.

00:08:46.760 --> 00:08:47.600
 - Yeah.

00:08:47.600 --> 00:08:48.440
 (laughing)

00:08:48.440 --> 00:08:49.600
 - Here's one.

00:08:49.600 --> 00:08:52.820
 It flies upward and a voice asks if it is tired.

00:08:52.820 --> 00:08:54.560
 It says no.

00:08:54.560 --> 00:08:55.400
 That's it.

00:08:55.400 --> 00:08:56.240
 - I'd say it.

00:08:56.240 --> 00:08:58.120
 Oh, I'd say it's, I'd say it's, I'd say it's.

00:08:58.120 --> 00:08:59.500
 - A toddler in a helicopter.

00:08:59.500 --> 00:09:02.000
 (laughing)

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:03.200
 - You must be tired.

00:09:03.200 --> 00:09:04.160
 We've been out all day.

00:09:04.160 --> 00:09:06.280
 I'm not tired, I'm not tired.

00:09:06.280 --> 00:09:07.560
 - Do you know the answer?

00:09:07.560 --> 00:09:08.400
 - No.

00:09:08.400 --> 00:09:09.380
 - Why not?

00:09:09.380 --> 00:09:11.260
 - It's not a question.

00:09:11.260 --> 00:09:13.860
 - No, it's a prompt rather than a question, let's say.

00:09:13.860 --> 00:09:14.700
 - Oh, okay.

00:09:14.700 --> 00:09:18.220
 - Another one, comment on the civilized behavior in Beijing.

00:09:18.220 --> 00:09:20.780
 (laughing)

00:09:20.780 --> 00:09:22.320
 - Don't, Andy, don't.

00:09:22.320 --> 00:09:23.980
 (laughing)

00:09:23.980 --> 00:09:25.060
 - No, okay.

00:09:25.060 --> 00:09:28.660
 - For what object you have a passion deep in the soul?

00:09:28.660 --> 00:09:32.420
 You could choose a plant, an animal, or a utensil.

00:09:32.420 --> 00:09:35.100
 - Oh, it's a great question.

00:09:35.100 --> 00:09:37.100
 - I see, I think I see what's happened here.

00:09:37.100 --> 00:09:38.280
 - And it's problematic.

00:09:38.280 --> 00:09:39.680
 Basically, the one big criticism

00:09:39.680 --> 00:09:41.280
 of the civil service exams historically

00:09:41.280 --> 00:09:43.000
 was that they were too pro-former

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:44.480
 and they were all about learning by rote,

00:09:44.480 --> 00:09:46.000
 didn't encourage creative thinking.

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:47.680
 And I think what they've done is they've swung

00:09:47.680 --> 00:09:49.600
 way too far the other way.

00:09:49.600 --> 00:09:51.480
 (laughing)

00:09:51.480 --> 00:09:54.000
 - Ah, there was a good cheating scandal.

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:55.440
 Well, there were a few great ones recently actually.

00:09:55.440 --> 00:09:57.720
 This was a niche one that I didn't know about.

00:09:57.720 --> 00:09:59.640
 This was in Montana in 2014.

00:09:59.640 --> 00:10:03.240
 And it was about 90 young officers in the military.

00:10:03.240 --> 00:10:05.040
 They were caught in a cheating scandal

00:10:05.040 --> 00:10:06.720
 where they'd been texting each other all the answers

00:10:06.720 --> 00:10:08.140
 for their questions.

00:10:08.140 --> 00:10:09.740
 They had to do a monthly test.

00:10:09.740 --> 00:10:11.260
 Unfortunately, they were the officers

00:10:11.260 --> 00:10:13.560
 in charge of nuclear missile launch

00:10:13.560 --> 00:10:15.100
 at the Malmström Air Force Base

00:10:15.100 --> 00:10:17.980
 and they had just been cheating all the way through.

00:10:17.980 --> 00:10:19.060
 And 'cause they'd been really worried,

00:10:19.060 --> 00:10:20.500
 they thought they had to get 100%

00:10:20.500 --> 00:10:22.740
 when actually it's only a 90% pass mark.

00:10:22.740 --> 00:10:24.140
 So, yeah.

00:10:24.140 --> 00:10:26.220
 - Wait, and they ended up in charge of--

00:10:26.220 --> 00:10:27.060
 - Nuclear launch.

00:10:27.060 --> 00:10:27.900
 - Right.

00:10:27.900 --> 00:10:29.180
 At that point, did they think

00:10:29.180 --> 00:10:31.780
 we may have prioritized the wrong thing here?

00:10:31.780 --> 00:10:33.700
 - They were all taken off their work.

00:10:33.700 --> 00:10:35.860
 And that's why no nukes were launched in 2014.

00:10:35.860 --> 00:10:37.660
 - Well, thank God.

00:10:37.660 --> 00:10:39.220
 - Thank God, yeah.

00:10:39.220 --> 00:10:40.060
 - Did you guys ever cheat?

00:10:40.060 --> 00:10:40.900
 Were you cheaters?

00:10:40.900 --> 00:10:41.740
 - No. - No.

00:10:41.740 --> 00:10:43.060
 - Goodness no.

00:10:43.060 --> 00:10:47.020
 - Come on, you're just more dishonest cheaters than I am.

00:10:47.020 --> 00:10:49.580
 - No, I would have shopped a cheater if I'd seen one,

00:10:49.580 --> 00:10:51.580
 but I was too busy focusing on my own work.

00:10:51.580 --> 00:10:53.260
 (audience laughs)

00:10:53.260 --> 00:10:54.920
 - I actually cheated for this episode.

00:10:54.920 --> 00:10:55.760
 - Did you?

00:10:55.760 --> 00:10:56.600
 - I sure did, yeah.

00:10:56.600 --> 00:10:59.660
 I asked ChatGPT for an interesting fact about cheating.

00:10:59.660 --> 00:11:00.480
 - Did you?

00:11:00.480 --> 00:11:01.320
 - Did you?

00:11:01.320 --> 00:11:02.160
 - Yeah, sure did.

00:11:02.160 --> 00:11:04.120
 I said, "Please make it surprising, unusual and quirky."

00:11:04.120 --> 00:11:07.780
 They said the headline, "Pigeons as Messengers."

00:11:07.780 --> 00:11:10.120
 In the early 2000s, some students in China

00:11:10.120 --> 00:11:11.820
 trained pigeons to carry crib sheets.

00:11:11.820 --> 00:11:13.220
 The pigeons were released from home

00:11:13.220 --> 00:11:14.620
 with the arms as tight as their legs

00:11:14.620 --> 00:11:16.740
 and flew to the students during exams.

00:11:16.740 --> 00:11:18.260
 It was hard to detect until the authorities

00:11:18.260 --> 00:11:19.580
 caught onto the flocks of pigeons

00:11:19.580 --> 00:11:21.260
 loitering around the exam halls.

00:11:21.260 --> 00:11:23.300
 (audience laughs)

00:11:23.300 --> 00:11:25.340
 Now, I have to say, I have tried to fact check this

00:11:25.340 --> 00:11:27.220
 and I can't find the evidence.

00:11:27.220 --> 00:11:29.580
 (audience laughs)

00:11:29.580 --> 00:11:32.420
 But I trust the robots as I think we all should.

00:11:32.420 --> 00:11:33.540
 (audience laughs)

00:11:33.540 --> 00:11:35.560
 - So why, when you can't find a source for my facts,

00:11:35.560 --> 00:11:36.540
 do you not trust it?

00:11:36.540 --> 00:11:38.600
 (audience laughs)

00:11:38.600 --> 00:11:40.260
 - The future is not in your hands, Dan.

00:11:40.260 --> 00:11:41.820
 Thank God, so.

00:11:41.820 --> 00:11:44.080
 - Have you guys seen the cheating hats that you can get?

00:11:44.080 --> 00:11:46.380
 So it's not, you can't actually buy them in retail shops,

00:11:46.380 --> 00:11:48.040
 but they happen in school classes

00:11:48.040 --> 00:11:49.680
 where teachers are a bit concerned

00:11:49.680 --> 00:11:51.760
 and they make peripheral blockers.

00:11:51.760 --> 00:11:55.560
 So you wear big elephant ears on the side of this hat.

00:11:55.560 --> 00:11:57.160
 So that if you try and look that way,

00:11:57.160 --> 00:11:58.960
 they're sort of sitting there, blocking you in.

00:11:58.960 --> 00:12:01.080
 - I would write the answers on the wings.

00:12:01.080 --> 00:12:02.420
 - Oh, yes.

00:12:02.420 --> 00:12:03.960
 Very nice, yeah.

00:12:03.960 --> 00:12:05.400
 - But I read an article about that

00:12:05.400 --> 00:12:08.120
 and it said that actually students quite like it.

00:12:08.120 --> 00:12:10.520
 They kind of feel like they're less stressed

00:12:10.520 --> 00:12:12.560
 because like normally they're thinking,

00:12:12.560 --> 00:12:14.400
 "Oh, people are thinking I'm going to be cheating,"

00:12:14.400 --> 00:12:16.880
 but it kind of takes it completely out of the equation.

00:12:16.880 --> 00:12:19.600
 - How the horse loves his blinkers, in a way.

00:12:19.600 --> 00:12:20.760
 - Oh, to see?

00:12:20.760 --> 00:12:21.600
 - I don't know, actually.

00:12:21.600 --> 00:12:23.520
 I mean, I don't know if horses like blinkers.

00:12:23.520 --> 00:12:26.440
 - There's another really good way of stopping people.

00:12:26.440 --> 00:12:28.480
 This is five and six year olds,

00:12:28.480 --> 00:12:30.040
 but it stops them from cheating, right?

00:12:30.040 --> 00:12:31.920
 You get them all in a room doing their exam.

00:12:31.920 --> 00:12:35.300
 They're in lines and you walk in with a magic wand

00:12:35.300 --> 00:12:37.700
 and you say, "I'm magicing a barrier between you

00:12:37.700 --> 00:12:40.060
 "so you can't read each other's answers,"

00:12:40.060 --> 00:12:42.580
 and that is enough to stop them from even trying.

00:12:42.580 --> 00:12:44.180
 - Really?

00:12:44.180 --> 00:12:45.540
 - They're faking it.

00:12:45.540 --> 00:12:47.220
 - You're right, that's great.

00:12:47.220 --> 00:12:49.060
 Now there's been a recent study in they found

00:12:49.060 --> 00:12:50.860
 that cheating went down by 20%

00:12:50.860 --> 00:12:53.340
 by people who did the magic wand tactic.

00:12:53.340 --> 00:12:54.180
 - Oh my.

00:12:54.180 --> 00:12:55.020
 - The Slytherin.

00:12:55.020 --> 00:12:55.860
 You could sort them right there in there.

00:12:55.860 --> 00:12:58.340
 (laughing)

00:12:58.340 --> 00:13:00.700
 - So in the 15th century, there was an exam

00:13:00.700 --> 00:13:02.660
 with one question that was so hard,

00:13:02.660 --> 00:13:05.300
 only two men in the entire country got it right.

00:13:05.300 --> 00:13:06.620
 - Oh wow.

00:13:06.620 --> 00:13:09.940
 - It was Tang Yin and his friend, Zhu Jing.

00:13:09.940 --> 00:13:11.020
 - They were both friends and they got it right.

00:13:11.020 --> 00:13:12.800
 - They were both friends and they got it right.

00:13:12.800 --> 00:13:14.460
 And so obviously everyone thought,

00:13:14.460 --> 00:13:16.980
 just as Andy thought, "How interesting."

00:13:16.980 --> 00:13:19.780
 And so they were arrested,

00:13:19.780 --> 00:13:22.260
 accused of bribing officials,

00:13:22.260 --> 00:13:25.180
 and they all the way said that they didn't do it,

00:13:25.180 --> 00:13:27.540
 but Zhu spent his entire rest of his life

00:13:27.540 --> 00:13:29.560
 waiting for a pardon which never came.

00:13:29.560 --> 00:13:31.060
 He didn't get his job.

00:13:31.060 --> 00:13:33.480
 And it was so bad that all of his descendants

00:13:33.480 --> 00:13:35.560
 also refused to take the exam.

00:13:35.560 --> 00:13:37.500
 - Wait, they refused to take it?

00:13:37.500 --> 00:13:38.340
 Or they were refused?

00:13:38.340 --> 00:13:39.180
 - They refused to take it.

00:13:39.180 --> 00:13:41.220
 They were like, "No, we don't believe in this anymore."

00:13:41.220 --> 00:13:45.260
 And his great-great-grandson who's called Zhu Ziaky.

00:13:45.260 --> 00:13:47.800
 So that's, think about how long that is later.

00:13:47.800 --> 00:13:49.700
 He decided he wasn't gonna take this exam

00:13:49.700 --> 00:13:51.500
 because his great-great-grandfather

00:13:51.500 --> 00:13:53.420
 had been accused of cheating.

00:13:53.420 --> 00:13:56.820
 And he became China's most influential travel writer

00:13:56.820 --> 00:13:59.800
 of whatever century was the 18th century.

00:13:59.800 --> 00:14:01.920
 Because he would have gone, he was a genius.

00:14:01.920 --> 00:14:03.400
 He would have gone into the civil service

00:14:03.400 --> 00:14:05.440
 because he didn't wanna take the exam.

00:14:05.440 --> 00:14:06.280
 He did this instead.

00:14:06.280 --> 00:14:07.720
 - That's exactly why I didn't take it

00:14:07.720 --> 00:14:09.840
 when I was given the chance.

00:14:09.840 --> 00:14:10.920
 I had more to give.

00:14:10.920 --> 00:14:14.040
 (all laughing)

00:14:14.040 --> 00:14:15.640
 - When are you gonna start giving it down?

00:14:15.640 --> 00:14:17.800
 (all laughing)

00:14:17.800 --> 00:14:20.380
 (upbeat music)

00:14:20.380 --> 00:14:26.600
 - It is time for fact number two, and that is Andy.

00:14:26.600 --> 00:14:29.560
 My fact is that in 2004, musician Jack White

00:14:29.560 --> 00:14:32.560
 released a single through the medium of a couch.

00:14:32.560 --> 00:14:33.400
 - Ooh.

00:14:33.400 --> 00:14:37.780
 - So Jack White, he was an upholsterer as a young man.

00:14:37.780 --> 00:14:40.380
 And one of his first bands actually was with another guy

00:14:40.380 --> 00:14:41.900
 who was an upholsterer.

00:14:41.900 --> 00:14:43.020
 They were a two piece band.

00:14:43.020 --> 00:14:43.860
 - Oh, that's cool.

00:14:43.860 --> 00:14:45.820
 - And they were upholstering by day and playing by night

00:14:45.820 --> 00:14:48.840
 and they had a great, then the band name was, any guesses?

00:14:48.840 --> 00:14:52.340
 - I was like, "Swayed is much better."

00:14:52.340 --> 00:14:54.820
 - They were called the upholsterers.

00:14:54.820 --> 00:14:56.420
 (all laughing)

00:14:56.420 --> 00:14:57.240
 - Okay.

00:14:57.240 --> 00:14:59.720
 - It's so clever, it's so simple, it's clever.

00:14:59.720 --> 00:15:01.060
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:15:01.060 --> 00:15:03.200
 - But he is better known as being in the White Stripes.

00:15:03.200 --> 00:15:05.760
 - Sorry, yes, White Stripes, and numerous other--

00:15:05.760 --> 00:15:06.580
 - Not to Andy.

00:15:06.580 --> 00:15:09.640
 (all laughing)

00:15:09.640 --> 00:15:10.960
 - The Who?

00:15:10.960 --> 00:15:11.880
 - No, I lost it.

00:15:11.880 --> 00:15:12.960
 - No, no, no, no, fuck.

00:15:12.960 --> 00:15:15.200
 (all laughing)

00:15:15.200 --> 00:15:19.120
 - So, they were in Detroit in 2004.

00:15:19.120 --> 00:15:21.360
 I think he just set up the White Stripes with Meg White,

00:15:21.360 --> 00:15:23.400
 but they had this little band and they were working

00:15:23.400 --> 00:15:27.260
 in an upholstery shop and they smuggled 100 singles

00:15:27.260 --> 00:15:31.020
 on vinyl into sofas in the shop that they were working in

00:15:31.020 --> 00:15:34.820
 and armchairs and only two have ever been found so far.

00:15:34.820 --> 00:15:35.660
 - Yeah.

00:15:35.660 --> 00:15:36.500
 - So, how's that?

00:15:36.500 --> 00:15:37.740
 - So, is it worth us ripping up our sofas?

00:15:37.740 --> 00:15:38.820
 - Yes, it is.

00:15:38.820 --> 00:15:40.380
 Go home tonight.

00:15:40.380 --> 00:15:41.700
 - 'Cause you don't know, yeah.

00:15:41.700 --> 00:15:42.780
 - And get busy.

00:15:42.780 --> 00:15:46.100
 And you won't be, even if you've got an x-ray machine,

00:15:46.100 --> 00:15:47.420
 you won't be able to x-ray it 'cause they did it

00:15:47.420 --> 00:15:50.900
 on transparent clear vinyl with transparency covers.

00:15:50.900 --> 00:15:51.940
 So, you cannot see it.

00:15:51.940 --> 00:15:53.840
 You can only know by destroying the sofa.

00:15:53.840 --> 00:15:54.960
 - They did this as a secret,

00:15:54.960 --> 00:15:56.920
 but we released a vinyl didn't we?

00:15:56.920 --> 00:16:00.500
 Years ago with Altenpop, this amazing record label.

00:16:00.500 --> 00:16:01.940
 And we also sold two copies.

00:16:01.940 --> 00:16:03.580
 (all laughing)

00:16:03.580 --> 00:16:06.480
 But they had this amazing idea for one of their bands

00:16:06.480 --> 00:16:08.600
 where they released the album,

00:16:08.600 --> 00:16:10.360
 but the only way you could buy the album

00:16:10.360 --> 00:16:12.560
 was to get it on the USB stick that they provided.

00:16:12.560 --> 00:16:15.040
 But the USB stick only came connected

00:16:15.040 --> 00:16:17.040
 to a very expensive bicycle.

00:16:17.040 --> 00:16:19.360
 So, you had to buy the bicycle in order to do it.

00:16:19.360 --> 00:16:21.200
 So, to buy the bicycle, that equates it

00:16:21.200 --> 00:16:23.500
 to something like 1,000 record sales

00:16:23.500 --> 00:16:24.860
 because it was a really good bike.

00:16:24.860 --> 00:16:27.140
 And so, the band technically sold,

00:16:27.140 --> 00:16:29.860
 in terms of building back their royalties, 1,000 copies.

00:16:29.860 --> 00:16:32.740
 So, that is ways that bands do that now.

00:16:32.740 --> 00:16:34.340
 - Wait, so did they just sell one?

00:16:34.340 --> 00:16:35.180
 - Just one.

00:16:35.180 --> 00:16:36.300
 - One sucker bought the bike.

00:16:36.300 --> 00:16:37.140
 - Yeah.

00:16:37.140 --> 00:16:37.980
 - Okay.

00:16:37.980 --> 00:16:38.820
 (laughing)

00:16:38.820 --> 00:16:40.380
 - Things in sofas?

00:16:40.380 --> 00:16:41.220
 - Sure.

00:16:41.220 --> 00:16:42.220
 - Things in sofas.

00:16:42.220 --> 00:16:44.980
 - If anyone is a phobic of snakes,

00:16:44.980 --> 00:16:46.300
 might want to pop out for a bit.

00:16:46.300 --> 00:16:47.460
 (audience laughing)

00:16:47.460 --> 00:16:49.340
 This was something that happened quite recently.

00:16:49.340 --> 00:16:51.160
 North Ayrshire, in Scotland,

00:16:51.160 --> 00:16:53.160
 staff were cleaning a sofa at a second-hand shop

00:16:53.160 --> 00:16:55.280
 and a python fell out of it.

00:16:55.280 --> 00:16:56.240
 - Oh.

00:16:56.240 --> 00:16:57.080
 - Dead?

00:16:57.080 --> 00:16:57.920
 - Dead.

00:16:57.920 --> 00:16:58.740
 - Okay.

00:16:58.740 --> 00:16:59.560
 - So, that's fine.

00:16:59.560 --> 00:17:00.400
 So, it was a second-hand shop and they were cleaning it.

00:17:00.400 --> 00:17:01.240
 - Not fine for the python.

00:17:01.240 --> 00:17:02.080
 - Not fine for the python.

00:17:02.080 --> 00:17:05.160
 But, get this, the people who donated the sofa

00:17:05.160 --> 00:17:07.560
 confirmed that they had never had a pet snake

00:17:07.560 --> 00:17:10.480
 and that they had got it second-hand themselves.

00:17:10.480 --> 00:17:12.760
 So, it had been the whole time they had owned it.

00:17:12.760 --> 00:17:14.600
 It had probably been in there.

00:17:14.600 --> 00:17:15.440
 - Right.

00:17:15.440 --> 00:17:16.920
 - Did they not decompose pythons?

00:17:16.920 --> 00:17:17.760
 - No.

00:17:17.760 --> 00:17:19.100
 - Is there something special about that?

00:17:19.100 --> 00:17:19.940
 (audience laughing)

00:17:19.940 --> 00:17:20.920
 And that's why when you walk the streets of London,

00:17:20.920 --> 00:17:22.760
 you'd ankle deep in dead pythons.

00:17:22.760 --> 00:17:23.600
 - Yeah.

00:17:23.600 --> 00:17:24.440
 - They'd just stick around, yeah.

00:17:24.440 --> 00:17:25.280
 - Amazing.

00:17:25.280 --> 00:17:26.120
 - I know.

00:17:26.120 --> 00:17:28.540
 And the spokesman for the second-hand place said,

00:17:28.540 --> 00:17:30.440
 "Don't let this discourage you from buying re-use

00:17:30.440 --> 00:17:31.280
 from others.

00:17:31.280 --> 00:17:32.880
 This is a very, very rare downside."

00:17:32.880 --> 00:17:34.800
 (audience laughing)

00:17:34.800 --> 00:17:37.520
 - There was a study in, well, there were two studies in 2016

00:17:37.520 --> 00:17:39.920
 and one of them found that the typical Brit

00:17:39.920 --> 00:17:43.480
 finds £3.27 a year in their sofa,

00:17:43.480 --> 00:17:44.880
 which is exciting.

00:17:44.880 --> 00:17:46.040
 That was in March.

00:17:46.040 --> 00:17:48.640
 And then, in October, there was another study

00:17:48.640 --> 00:17:52.620
 showing that the average Brit finds £5.77 in their sofa.

00:17:52.620 --> 00:17:53.460
 What's happened between--

00:17:53.460 --> 00:17:55.580
 - Well, obviously, the first study

00:17:55.580 --> 00:17:57.140
 has brought it to everyone's attention

00:17:57.140 --> 00:17:58.620
 and everyone's gone, "Oh, I'm going to look at myself

00:17:58.620 --> 00:17:59.460
 in that one." - Oh, yeah.

00:17:59.460 --> 00:18:00.540
 - The average has gone way up.

00:18:00.540 --> 00:18:01.620
 - What year was this?

00:18:01.620 --> 00:18:02.460
 Was this recently?

00:18:02.460 --> 00:18:03.300
 - 2016.

00:18:03.300 --> 00:18:04.120
 - 2016.

00:18:04.120 --> 00:18:04.960
 - I feel like it's going down.

00:18:04.960 --> 00:18:05.780
 - It must have changed since then.

00:18:05.780 --> 00:18:06.620
 - Yeah, yeah.

00:18:06.620 --> 00:18:08.060
 - These days, you'll find half a Bitcoin down there.

00:18:08.060 --> 00:18:09.380
 (audience laughing)

00:18:09.380 --> 00:18:13.700
 - I read the study from 2017 that said 52% of people

00:18:13.700 --> 00:18:16.380
 had lost money down the side of their sofa

00:18:16.380 --> 00:18:21.380
 and only 46% said they found any money down their sofa.

00:18:21.380 --> 00:18:22.920
 - So there's money to be found?

00:18:22.920 --> 00:18:25.160
 - No, unfortunately, 6% of people said

00:18:25.160 --> 00:18:27.240
 they found money down someone else's sofa.

00:18:27.240 --> 00:18:30.240
 (audience laughing)

00:18:30.240 --> 00:18:34.240
 - Hey, I read a crazy thing about sofas.

00:18:34.240 --> 00:18:35.880
 This blew my mind today.

00:18:35.880 --> 00:18:37.720
 If you go and you off to buy a sofa

00:18:37.720 --> 00:18:39.040
 and you want to get a leather sofa

00:18:39.040 --> 00:18:42.120
 and you see in the shop, it says genuine leather,

00:18:42.120 --> 00:18:45.600
 you go, "Ah, that's going to be a great sofa," right?

00:18:45.600 --> 00:18:46.440
 - Right.

00:18:46.440 --> 00:18:47.280
 - It's a cheat.

00:18:47.280 --> 00:18:48.120
 It's a cheat.

00:18:48.120 --> 00:18:48.960
 - What?

00:18:48.960 --> 00:18:49.800
 - It's okay.

00:18:49.800 --> 00:18:51.960
 There are five kinds of leather sofas

00:18:51.960 --> 00:18:54.260
 that you can get in terms of quality

00:18:54.260 --> 00:18:57.500
 and the fourth worst is genuine leather

00:18:57.500 --> 00:18:59.980
 because they just call it genuine leather.

00:18:59.980 --> 00:19:00.820
 That's its name.

00:19:00.820 --> 00:19:01.660
 - Is it not leather?

00:19:01.660 --> 00:19:03.760
 - No, it can be up to the discretion of the maker.

00:19:03.760 --> 00:19:06.520
 It could be anything between one and 100% leather.

00:19:06.520 --> 00:19:08.660
 They could put 2% leather in there

00:19:08.660 --> 00:19:10.540
 and they market it as genuine leather

00:19:10.540 --> 00:19:12.400
 'cause that's what you call that style.

00:19:12.400 --> 00:19:13.700
 - Oh my God.

00:19:13.700 --> 00:19:14.580
 - Who do we write to?

00:19:14.580 --> 00:19:16.660
 - We are about to get sued by DFS.

00:19:16.660 --> 00:19:18.500
 - Really?

00:19:18.500 --> 00:19:19.920
 What are the other things called?

00:19:19.920 --> 00:19:21.480
 What's the genuine leather?

00:19:21.480 --> 00:19:23.660
 Okay, full grain leather is number one.

00:19:23.660 --> 00:19:25.260
 Top grain leather is number two,

00:19:25.260 --> 00:19:26.860
 which again, a bit confusing.

00:19:26.860 --> 00:19:29.060
 Split grain leather, number three.

00:19:29.060 --> 00:19:31.060
 Genuine leather comes in at number four

00:19:31.060 --> 00:19:32.340
 and then bonded leather,

00:19:32.340 --> 00:19:34.340
 which is basically just whatever the fuck

00:19:34.340 --> 00:19:36.460
 they want to put together.

00:19:36.460 --> 00:19:38.220
 - What's the 1% leather?

00:19:38.220 --> 00:19:39.460
 That's not good, yeah.

00:19:39.460 --> 00:19:41.100
 - Yeah, so just next time you're in a shop

00:19:41.100 --> 00:19:42.940
 and you see genuine leather, it's not.

00:19:42.940 --> 00:19:43.780
 - Good Lord.

00:19:43.780 --> 00:19:44.780
 - That's really good.

00:19:44.780 --> 00:19:46.660
 You should do consumer programs.

00:19:46.660 --> 00:19:47.980
 - Oh yeah.

00:19:47.980 --> 00:19:49.820
 - I see that in your stars.

00:19:49.820 --> 00:19:52.580
 Last year, police found something

00:19:52.580 --> 00:19:55.100
 down the back of a sofa in Florida

00:19:55.100 --> 00:19:57.780
 and it was a suspected drug dealer named Stacy.

00:19:57.780 --> 00:20:02.780
 And she was caught between the folds of a sofa.

00:20:02.780 --> 00:20:03.620
 - Oh my God.

00:20:03.620 --> 00:20:06.620
 - She was in there, the arrest photo is phenomenally good.

00:20:06.620 --> 00:20:07.460
 It's so good.

00:20:07.460 --> 00:20:08.940
 She's just emerging.

00:20:08.940 --> 00:20:09.780
 - But that is the most,

00:20:09.780 --> 00:20:12.140
 it's one of the most insanely awesome disguises

00:20:12.140 --> 00:20:12.980
 you'll ever see.

00:20:12.980 --> 00:20:14.540
 I know we've mentioned this a bunch of times before,

00:20:14.540 --> 00:20:17.020
 but like people who were trying to get across

00:20:17.020 --> 00:20:18.420
 from one side of Germany to the other

00:20:18.420 --> 00:20:20.620
 during the Berlin Wall, they would go in cars

00:20:20.620 --> 00:20:22.300
 and they would be the passenger seat.

00:20:22.300 --> 00:20:25.460
 So they would be inside, sitting within the leather.

00:20:25.460 --> 00:20:27.500
 Back in the day when they were taking Victorian photos

00:20:27.500 --> 00:20:29.380
 and kids because of the exposure time,

00:20:29.380 --> 00:20:31.580
 you'd have to take a photo, take one and a half minutes.

00:20:31.580 --> 00:20:33.620
 Parents would dress up as the sofa

00:20:33.620 --> 00:20:35.940
 and hold the kids on their legs

00:20:35.940 --> 00:20:38.220
 so that the kid would stay there for the minute and a half.

00:20:38.220 --> 00:20:39.060
 It took to do it.

00:20:39.060 --> 00:20:41.140
 Like we've got a whole history of dressing up

00:20:41.140 --> 00:20:46.140
 as sofas to do it, advance our species.

00:20:46.140 --> 00:20:47.060
 - Do you say advance?

00:20:47.060 --> 00:20:47.900
 - Yeah.

00:20:47.900 --> 00:20:48.740
 - Advance our species.

00:20:48.740 --> 00:20:49.860
 - Oh, advance, yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:20:49.860 --> 00:20:52.860
 - I actually wanna, I've got to be in my bonnet about that

00:20:52.860 --> 00:20:54.420
 since you've raised it, which you have.

00:20:54.420 --> 00:20:55.460
 - J.D. Vance.

00:20:55.460 --> 00:20:57.100
 - J.D. Vance.

00:20:57.100 --> 00:20:58.580
 I was told, 'cause I'm not on social media

00:20:58.580 --> 00:21:01.740
 and so I don't pick up on sort of the news.

00:21:01.740 --> 00:21:03.660
 When I pick up on the real news, it's not on social media

00:21:03.660 --> 00:21:06.420
 but not the crap news that the rest of you read.

00:21:06.420 --> 00:21:10.940
 And you guys told me he had sex with a sofa.

00:21:11.940 --> 00:21:15.820
 - J.D. Vance, for future lists of the podcast is...

00:21:15.820 --> 00:21:17.140
 - What's the president?

00:21:17.140 --> 00:21:20.420
 (audience laughing)

00:21:20.420 --> 00:21:22.100
 - But who'd have thought that first lady,

00:21:22.100 --> 00:21:25.540
 the enormous sofa that came to the White House with a...

00:21:25.540 --> 00:21:28.780
 (audience laughing)

00:21:28.780 --> 00:21:30.380
 - Yeah, Travis surrounding me.

00:21:30.380 --> 00:21:31.740
 Someone just made it up on Twitter,

00:21:31.740 --> 00:21:34.020
 the idea that he'd had sex with a sofa.

00:21:34.020 --> 00:21:35.060
 - I see it's fake.

00:21:35.060 --> 00:21:35.900
 - It's completely fake.

00:21:35.900 --> 00:21:36.820
 - It's pure fake, it's pure fake.

00:21:36.820 --> 00:21:38.300
 It could have been one of your facts then.

00:21:38.300 --> 00:21:40.980
 There's not a grain of truth in it.

00:21:40.980 --> 00:21:41.980
 No, it is, it's not fake.

00:21:41.980 --> 00:21:44.500
 It's really not, yeah, it's genuinely nonsense.

00:21:44.500 --> 00:21:47.140
 - And now people feel they need to be referencing it.

00:21:47.140 --> 00:21:48.380
 What's happened to American debate?

00:21:48.380 --> 00:21:51.060
 Walt said, running mate of...

00:21:51.060 --> 00:21:53.060
 - Oh, he used to be the leader of the resistance, yes.

00:21:53.060 --> 00:21:54.860
 (audience laughing)

00:21:54.860 --> 00:21:56.300
 - I can't wait to debate this guy.

00:21:56.300 --> 00:21:59.020
 That is, if he's willing to get off the couch and show up.

00:21:59.020 --> 00:21:59.860
 I mean...

00:21:59.860 --> 00:22:01.020
 - Yeah, it was a bit weird.

00:22:01.020 --> 00:22:03.460
 - It's all gone a bit weird, hasn't it?

00:22:03.460 --> 00:22:06.020
 - Here's the thing, to get a bit political,

00:22:06.020 --> 00:22:08.660
 which is the most English way of saying

00:22:08.660 --> 00:22:12.260
 that item of furniture, sofa, couch, or seti?

00:22:12.260 --> 00:22:13.820
 - What's the most English way of saying it?

00:22:13.820 --> 00:22:14.660
 - Yeah.

00:22:14.660 --> 00:22:17.020
 - Okay, so couch is, I think, from French Couché.

00:22:17.020 --> 00:22:18.700
 So that's not a... - Good, very good.

00:22:18.700 --> 00:22:20.060
 - Okay, so what's left, couch and seti?

00:22:20.060 --> 00:22:22.860
 - Sofa, seti. - Sorry, sofa and seti.

00:22:22.860 --> 00:22:26.260
 - Sofa, did I read that one from Arabic?

00:22:26.260 --> 00:22:27.380
 - Very good.

00:22:27.380 --> 00:22:28.700
 - I shouldn't ask these questions to people

00:22:28.700 --> 00:22:30.740
 who've just spent a day researching sofas,

00:22:30.740 --> 00:22:31.580
 should I really?

00:22:31.580 --> 00:22:35.100
 - I think, yes, I think it's on the sofa in Arabic.

00:22:35.100 --> 00:22:37.780
 - Yeah, but I actually don't know what seti is from, so...

00:22:37.780 --> 00:22:39.580
 - It's from the old English setam,

00:22:39.580 --> 00:22:42.300
 meaning to sit down, like, to set something down.

00:22:42.300 --> 00:22:43.340
 - So that's properly old English?

00:22:43.340 --> 00:22:45.180
 - So if you want to speak proper old English,

00:22:45.180 --> 00:22:46.740
 I think there are different, like,

00:22:46.740 --> 00:22:50.060
 sofas have different arms and stuff like that these days.

00:22:50.060 --> 00:22:51.140
 Do you know what, in France,

00:22:51.140 --> 00:22:52.900
 they call one of those sofas

00:22:52.900 --> 00:22:54.980
 that has just one arm at the back of it,

00:22:54.980 --> 00:22:56.140
 and you kind of lie on it.

00:22:56.140 --> 00:22:57.300
 - I think that is a chaise longue.

00:22:57.300 --> 00:23:01.900
 - No, they call it a meridienne in France, a chaise longue.

00:23:01.900 --> 00:23:03.380
 If they're talking about a chaise longue,

00:23:03.380 --> 00:23:06.100
 they're referring to a deque chair.

00:23:06.100 --> 00:23:07.460
 - Isn't that interesting? - Isn't it really?

00:23:07.460 --> 00:23:08.620
 - Yeah.

00:23:08.620 --> 00:23:10.100
 - French for deque chair is chaise longue.

00:23:10.100 --> 00:23:12.860
 - A genuine murmur of shock and dismay went through the roof of that.

00:23:12.860 --> 00:23:14.460
 That's really interesting.

00:23:14.460 --> 00:23:17.140
 - What is a deque chair, if not a chaise longue

00:23:17.140 --> 00:23:19.500
 with all the cushions ripped off and put outside, I suppose?

00:23:19.500 --> 00:23:20.340
 - Exactly.

00:23:20.340 --> 00:23:21.820
 - Yeah, you just see where they're coming from.

00:23:21.820 --> 00:23:24.780
 - I'm very one of those Chinese civil service exams,

00:23:24.780 --> 00:23:25.940
 with musings like that.

00:23:25.940 --> 00:23:27.620
 Do you want to hear some sofa slang?

00:23:27.620 --> 00:23:28.460
 - Yeah.

00:23:28.460 --> 00:23:30.620
 - What is a sofa pounder?

00:23:30.620 --> 00:23:31.980
 - We're not back on chaisee pants, you know.

00:23:31.980 --> 00:23:34.180
 - No, come on.

00:23:34.180 --> 00:23:36.020
 Grow up.

00:23:36.020 --> 00:23:40.060
 - Is it a burger, but the buns look like sofas?

00:23:40.060 --> 00:23:41.380
 - That's really good.

00:23:41.380 --> 00:23:43.620
 - Oh, is it when you do, is it that cushion process

00:23:43.620 --> 00:23:47.740
 where you do the judo chop to make the sofa plump up?

00:23:47.740 --> 00:23:48.580
 Do you know what I mean?

00:23:48.580 --> 00:23:49.420
 - Yeah.

00:23:49.420 --> 00:23:50.260
 - That's a sofa pounder.

00:23:50.260 --> 00:23:52.460
 No, it's just an observer or a non-participant.

00:23:52.460 --> 00:23:53.860
 You're just sitting on the sofa.

00:23:53.860 --> 00:23:57.420
 What is to couch a porker?

00:23:57.420 --> 00:24:00.260
 - Again, guys.

00:24:00.260 --> 00:24:01.860
 - Did you have all this before, Anna told you

00:24:01.860 --> 00:24:04.140
 that JD Vance didn't do this.

00:24:04.140 --> 00:24:06.860
 - It's wasted research, so I'm just reading it out.

00:24:06.860 --> 00:24:09.500
 - So couch a porker, something to do with pig farming?

00:24:09.500 --> 00:24:10.340
 - No.

00:24:10.340 --> 00:24:11.780
 - Is there something to do with lyes?

00:24:11.780 --> 00:24:13.700
 - It's to just lie down and have a nap.

00:24:13.700 --> 00:24:15.540
 - Well, a different kind of lie, actually, but okay.

00:24:15.540 --> 00:24:18.060
 - And what is couch hockey for one?

00:24:18.060 --> 00:24:21.300
 (audience laughing)

00:24:21.300 --> 00:24:22.660
 - That one is rude.

00:24:22.660 --> 00:24:25.020
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, that one is rude.

00:24:25.020 --> 00:24:27.600
 (upbeat music)

00:24:29.900 --> 00:24:33.300
 - It is time for fact number three, and that is my fact.

00:24:33.300 --> 00:24:35.780
 My fact this week is that the mathematician

00:24:35.780 --> 00:24:39.540
 who developed GPS didn't make it to the job interview

00:24:39.540 --> 00:24:41.940
 where she'd later developed GPS

00:24:41.940 --> 00:24:45.540
 because she couldn't work out the directions to get there.

00:24:45.540 --> 00:24:47.460
 - Ah, 'cause you haven't invented GPS yet.

00:24:47.460 --> 00:24:49.100
 - Yeah, exactly, yeah.

00:24:49.100 --> 00:24:53.380
 This is an amazing woman, so Gladys West.

00:24:53.380 --> 00:24:54.220
 - Gladys?

00:24:54.220 --> 00:24:57.700
 - I think it's just, it's spelled with a Y,

00:24:57.700 --> 00:24:58.780
 but I think it's just Gladys.

00:24:58.780 --> 00:25:00.700
 So Gladys West, yeah.

00:25:00.700 --> 00:25:02.100
 - Are you saying the woman who invented GPS

00:25:02.100 --> 00:25:03.260
 has West in her name?

00:25:03.260 --> 00:25:04.100
 - Isn't that amazing?

00:25:04.100 --> 00:25:04.940
 - That's crackers.

00:25:04.940 --> 00:25:06.660
 - Yeah, yeah, so she's a co-developer

00:25:06.660 --> 00:25:08.620
 and she is an incredible woman.

00:25:08.620 --> 00:25:11.020
 She's still alive, she's in her 90s

00:25:11.020 --> 00:25:14.500
 and she believed for numbers of reasons

00:25:14.500 --> 00:25:16.100
 that she shouldn't go to this job interview,

00:25:16.100 --> 00:25:18.420
 which was offered to her, which was with the Navy

00:25:18.420 --> 00:25:20.100
 in America and she was an African-American.

00:25:20.100 --> 00:25:21.300
 She thought they're not gonna give me a job.

00:25:21.300 --> 00:25:24.360
 No women like me are given any kind of job.

00:25:24.360 --> 00:25:26.780
 There's only four people of color within the company as is.

00:25:26.780 --> 00:25:28.180
 Why would they give it to me?

00:25:28.180 --> 00:25:30.100
 I can't actually find it on a map,

00:25:30.100 --> 00:25:33.580
 so I don't know where I'm going even to get there.

00:25:33.580 --> 00:25:37.100
 And I just don't do job interviews 'cause I'm that good.

00:25:37.100 --> 00:25:39.940
 So she didn't go for the job interview,

00:25:39.940 --> 00:25:42.020
 but then they did end up chasing after her

00:25:42.020 --> 00:25:43.020
 and giving her the job.

00:25:43.020 --> 00:25:45.940
 And then many years later, through lots of developments,

00:25:45.940 --> 00:25:47.820
 she created what was the framework

00:25:47.820 --> 00:25:50.020
 of what then became GPS.

00:25:50.020 --> 00:25:52.980
 And so even then, after she invented this

00:25:52.980 --> 00:25:55.040
 or helped to invent this life-changing thing,

00:25:55.040 --> 00:25:56.060
 she still never used it

00:25:56.060 --> 00:25:57.660
 'cause she just preferred road maps.

00:25:57.660 --> 00:25:58.740
 (laughing)

00:25:58.740 --> 00:25:59.900
 And I think, is this right?

00:25:59.900 --> 00:26:01.500
 'Cause this is just from what I read.

00:26:01.500 --> 00:26:03.820
 But if GPS is like satellites,

00:26:03.820 --> 00:26:06.900
 it tells you where you are by things about snow satellites,

00:26:06.900 --> 00:26:09.380
 but they need to know the shape of the Earth.

00:26:09.380 --> 00:26:10.380
 And the Earth is not just--

00:26:10.380 --> 00:26:11.220
 - Round.

00:26:11.220 --> 00:26:12.620
 - There you go, Gladys.

00:26:12.620 --> 00:26:14.780
 - Oh, well, well, well, well.

00:26:14.780 --> 00:26:16.380
 - It is a rocky era.

00:26:16.380 --> 00:26:18.340
 It's not round, that's the whole point.

00:26:18.340 --> 00:26:19.900
 I mean, we know that it's a spheroid,

00:26:19.900 --> 00:26:21.700
 it's thicker at the equator,

00:26:21.700 --> 00:26:24.840
 but also there's lumps and bumps and tidal poles

00:26:24.840 --> 00:26:26.260
 and all that kind of stuff.

00:26:26.260 --> 00:26:28.180
 And she worked out the algorithms that account

00:26:28.180 --> 00:26:30.420
 for all of these little bumps on the Earth.

00:26:30.420 --> 00:26:31.380
 - Yeah. - Yeah.

00:26:31.380 --> 00:26:32.820
 - And she did amazing things.

00:26:32.820 --> 00:26:34.500
 Like she was one of the people to determine

00:26:34.500 --> 00:26:37.500
 the movement of Pluto in relation to Neptune.

00:26:37.500 --> 00:26:38.340
 Amazing person.

00:26:38.340 --> 00:26:41.780
 By the way, Neptune was discovered by a couch.

00:26:41.780 --> 00:26:43.900
 - Well, yeah. - Go on.

00:26:43.900 --> 00:26:46.380
 - I said, John Couch Adams.

00:26:46.380 --> 00:26:48.740
 He was a British mathematician and astronomer.

00:26:48.740 --> 00:26:49.580
 Yeah, and he--

00:26:49.580 --> 00:26:52.980
 - I only referred him as John Sofa Adams.

00:26:52.980 --> 00:26:55.660
 - That's from the Arabic, he's John Sati Adams, actually.

00:26:55.660 --> 00:26:59.700
 - I sort of vaguely knew that GPS was a military thing.

00:26:59.700 --> 00:27:02.060
 Or like an American Department of Defense

00:27:02.060 --> 00:27:02.900
 sort of something thing.

00:27:02.900 --> 00:27:03.740
 But I had no idea.

00:27:03.740 --> 00:27:07.260
 It was really like, it's properly, it's still run by,

00:27:07.260 --> 00:27:08.580
 do you know who runs it these days?

00:27:08.580 --> 00:27:10.140
 - Space Force.

00:27:10.140 --> 00:27:11.940
 - Oh. - Space Force.

00:27:11.940 --> 00:27:12.780
 It's been handed over to them.

00:27:12.780 --> 00:27:15.340
 They're very new and they've got control of GPS now.

00:27:15.340 --> 00:27:17.620
 - Are they under the auspices of the US still

00:27:17.620 --> 00:27:18.500
 or has it been globalized?

00:27:18.500 --> 00:27:19.780
 - Space Force has not been spun out.

00:27:19.780 --> 00:27:20.620
 It's still, yeah, yeah.

00:27:20.620 --> 00:27:21.700
 - It's still America. - It's America.

00:27:21.700 --> 00:27:23.540
 - America. - Oh, the US government.

00:27:23.540 --> 00:27:24.380
 - Yeah, it's US government.

00:27:24.380 --> 00:27:27.700
 - The master control station is in Colorado.

00:27:27.700 --> 00:27:29.700
 And they're really young as well.

00:27:29.700 --> 00:27:31.980
 The average age of the, I don't know if they're called conductors.

00:27:31.980 --> 00:27:33.220
 They can't be called conductors.

00:27:33.220 --> 00:27:34.740
 Like, ding, ding, ding.

00:27:34.740 --> 00:27:37.020
 Everyone aboard the Space Force.

00:27:37.020 --> 00:27:37.860
 All aboard.

00:27:37.860 --> 00:27:40.260
 That's good.

00:27:40.260 --> 00:27:43.260
 No, but their average age is 23.

00:27:43.260 --> 00:27:44.100
 It's very heavy response.

00:27:44.100 --> 00:27:45.380
 - Wow. - That's, I know.

00:27:45.380 --> 00:27:46.860
 - Oh my God. - No, I can't trust that.

00:27:46.860 --> 00:27:47.700
 - I know.

00:27:47.700 --> 00:27:48.540
 - But it's-- - But it was--

00:27:48.540 --> 00:27:50.860
 - Hang on, like NASA, the Apollo missions,

00:27:50.860 --> 00:27:53.220
 everyone in mission control were youngins.

00:27:53.220 --> 00:27:55.660
 They were all late teens. - Were they 23?

00:27:55.660 --> 00:27:56.820
 - That's true. - Yeah, yeah, they were all,

00:27:56.820 --> 00:27:58.020
 they were all late teens.

00:27:58.020 --> 00:28:01.460
 - Give us a cheer if you're older than 23 in the audience.

00:28:01.460 --> 00:28:02.980
 (audience cheering)

00:28:02.980 --> 00:28:03.940
 - Nice.

00:28:03.940 --> 00:28:06.620
 Do we dare ask the following question?

00:28:06.620 --> 00:28:08.540
 Give us a cheer if you're under 23?

00:28:08.540 --> 00:28:11.420
 - Yeah. - Well, don't be ashamed.

00:28:11.420 --> 00:28:14.900
 - We've got an audience of people

00:28:14.900 --> 00:28:17.380
 who are too old to be in NASA.

00:28:17.380 --> 00:28:19.100
 I think that's what we've discovered.

00:28:19.100 --> 00:28:20.780
 - But the aim of it, according to Brad Parkinson,

00:28:20.780 --> 00:28:22.700
 it was also one of the guys named

00:28:22.700 --> 00:28:23.700
 the father of GPS.

00:28:23.700 --> 00:28:25.300
 I mean, all sorts of people are given titles about it,

00:28:25.300 --> 00:28:26.340
 but he was very important.

00:28:26.340 --> 00:28:30.220
 The mission was to drop five bombs in the same hole.

00:28:30.220 --> 00:28:32.020
 - Wow. - Wow, that is--

00:28:32.020 --> 00:28:34.300
 - Why do you want to drop five bombs in the same hole?

00:28:34.300 --> 00:28:38.140
 - In case, I think he was in a high-falutin' way

00:28:38.140 --> 00:28:39.700
 trying to say we need accuracy

00:28:39.700 --> 00:28:41.780
 in terms of where we're dropping our lethal bombs.

00:28:41.780 --> 00:28:42.940
 - Oh, I see.

00:28:42.940 --> 00:28:45.100
 - I don't think there was a particularly dangerous hole

00:28:45.100 --> 00:28:47.060
 that they needed to subdue.

00:28:47.060 --> 00:28:49.100
 - We've got to destroy that hole every time we hit it.

00:28:49.100 --> 00:28:50.100
 It just gets bigger.

00:28:50.100 --> 00:28:52.340
 (laughing)

00:28:52.340 --> 00:28:57.100
 - There was a worry, wasn't there,

00:28:57.100 --> 00:29:00.020
 that UK Trident Missiles used GPS

00:29:00.020 --> 00:29:02.820
 because GPS is an American military thing.

00:29:02.820 --> 00:29:04.620
 And if we were to go to war with America,

00:29:04.620 --> 00:29:06.580
 all they'd have to do is turn off the GPS

00:29:06.580 --> 00:29:08.460
 and our missiles wouldn't be able to hit anywhere.

00:29:08.460 --> 00:29:09.300
 - Right.

00:29:09.300 --> 00:29:10.980
 - But I believe that isn't true

00:29:10.980 --> 00:29:13.220
 because I was reading about how Trident Missiles

00:29:13.220 --> 00:29:14.380
 find their way to places.

00:29:14.380 --> 00:29:15.380
 And this is amazing.

00:29:15.380 --> 00:29:17.660
 They use stellar sighting.

00:29:17.660 --> 00:29:18.500
 - What's that mean?

00:29:18.500 --> 00:29:19.860
 - They look at the stars.

00:29:19.860 --> 00:29:20.700
 - What?

00:29:20.700 --> 00:29:21.980
 - Isn't that amazing? - That's incredible.

00:29:21.980 --> 00:29:26.540
 - Even at daytime, they can lock onto 11 stars.

00:29:26.540 --> 00:29:27.820
 - I guess it is. - Isn't that insane?

00:29:27.820 --> 00:29:28.860
 - I've got an app. - That's amazing.

00:29:28.860 --> 00:29:29.980
 - I've got an app where you can see

00:29:29.980 --> 00:29:32.180
 where the stars are even in daytime and that.

00:29:32.180 --> 00:29:34.260
 So, yeah, it's actually less impressive

00:29:34.260 --> 00:29:35.780
 when you know that they actually know

00:29:35.780 --> 00:29:37.700
 where they are and it's not through vision.

00:29:37.700 --> 00:29:38.540
 - Yeah, but you're a person.

00:29:38.540 --> 00:29:39.540
 This is a piece of rock.

00:29:39.540 --> 00:29:40.780
 It's a bit of rock, though.

00:29:40.780 --> 00:29:43.260
 (laughing)

00:29:43.260 --> 00:29:44.300
 Look, it's Trident, all right?

00:29:44.300 --> 00:29:45.940
 It's probably gonna be a bit old.

00:29:45.940 --> 00:29:48.300
 But that's unbelievable.

00:29:48.300 --> 00:29:51.260
 'Cause you don't want, if you've got your missiles,

00:29:51.260 --> 00:29:53.700
 you don't want them to rely on this technology,

00:29:53.700 --> 00:29:56.420
 which could be knocked out by someone else's Space Force.

00:29:56.420 --> 00:29:58.420
 - Yeah. - Wow.

00:29:58.420 --> 00:30:01.700
 - Mind you, using 11, why do you need to use so many?

00:30:01.700 --> 00:30:04.420
 'Cause GPS, we use four.

00:30:04.420 --> 00:30:06.540
 - Four what? - Four satellites, sorry.

00:30:06.540 --> 00:30:08.460
 So when we're navigating by GPS,

00:30:08.460 --> 00:30:10.620
 it means that the receiver in your car,

00:30:10.620 --> 00:30:13.460
 that's receiving signals from four satellites.

00:30:13.460 --> 00:30:15.780
 But I spent, I must have wasted four hours

00:30:15.780 --> 00:30:17.420
 working out why the fourth one exists.

00:30:17.420 --> 00:30:20.300
 So three of them are to, basically,

00:30:20.300 --> 00:30:22.260
 you work out how far you are from one satellite.

00:30:22.260 --> 00:30:24.260
 Then there's like a radius drawn around that

00:30:24.260 --> 00:30:25.460
 and you could be anywhere on that line.

00:30:25.460 --> 00:30:27.860
 And then you work out how far you are from a second

00:30:27.860 --> 00:30:30.220
 and that gives you two possible positions you could be in.

00:30:30.220 --> 00:30:32.140
 And then you work out how far you are from a third

00:30:32.140 --> 00:30:33.540
 and that tells you where you are.

00:30:33.540 --> 00:30:34.660
 - 'Cause that pinpoints you.

00:30:34.660 --> 00:30:36.100
 - Exactly, that pinpoints you.

00:30:36.100 --> 00:30:37.380
 And then there's a fourth one.

00:30:37.380 --> 00:30:39.020
 - Time. - And it's time.

00:30:39.020 --> 00:30:40.500
 Exactly, it's time.

00:30:40.500 --> 00:30:41.460
 - The fourth dimension.

00:30:41.460 --> 00:30:43.260
 We know where the suspect is.

00:30:43.260 --> 00:30:45.140
 (laughing)

00:30:45.140 --> 00:30:47.820
 - What about if we got there before it was a hole?

00:30:47.820 --> 00:30:50.580
 (laughing)

00:30:50.580 --> 00:30:54.100
 - And that's why GPS so often makes you late.

00:30:54.100 --> 00:30:54.980
 - So what is it, Anna?

00:30:54.980 --> 00:30:55.820
 What is it?

00:30:55.820 --> 00:30:56.660
 - It is time.

00:30:56.660 --> 00:31:01.220
 Basically, it's the fact that the clock in your Garmin

00:31:01.220 --> 00:31:03.220
 is shit, whereas the clock in all satellites

00:31:03.220 --> 00:31:04.060
 is an atomic clock.

00:31:04.060 --> 00:31:06.340
 They've in fact got four in case the first three cock up.

00:31:06.340 --> 00:31:08.220
 And so the fourth satellite is sort of acting

00:31:08.220 --> 00:31:09.780
 like a substitute clock.

00:31:09.780 --> 00:31:11.140
 - So I'm sure you're right.

00:31:11.140 --> 00:31:13.060
 I thought I had found out something different,

00:31:13.060 --> 00:31:14.580
 which is that it's your elevation.

00:31:14.580 --> 00:31:17.380
 It also is that, that's a complicated thing.

00:31:17.380 --> 00:31:18.220
 - Okay.

00:31:18.220 --> 00:31:20.340
 - Because the Earth, it's all spheres.

00:31:20.340 --> 00:31:23.300
 So actually, I think the other thing is that...

00:31:23.300 --> 00:31:24.300
 - It's all spheres.

00:31:24.300 --> 00:31:25.660
 Discuss.

00:31:25.660 --> 00:31:28.100
 Welcome to the Chinese civil service exams.

00:31:28.100 --> 00:31:29.780
 (laughing)

00:31:29.780 --> 00:31:31.300
 - Let me just check my pants.

00:31:31.300 --> 00:31:33.500
 (laughing)

00:31:33.500 --> 00:31:35.900
 - I know this, it's on my gusset, I'm sure of it.

00:31:35.900 --> 00:31:38.180
 - No, no, guys, please.

00:31:38.180 --> 00:31:39.340
 - That's so confused.

00:31:39.340 --> 00:31:40.180
 - Yeah.

00:31:40.180 --> 00:31:43.340
 - Why does GPS get it wrong sometimes then?

00:31:43.340 --> 00:31:44.620
 There's a whole Wikipedia article,

00:31:44.620 --> 00:31:46.180
 I saw called "Death by GPS."

00:31:46.180 --> 00:31:47.620
 - Okay, that is human error.

00:31:47.620 --> 00:31:49.980
 That is people following GPS when they shouldn't be,

00:31:49.980 --> 00:31:51.220
 when they can see there's a road in front of them

00:31:51.220 --> 00:31:53.940
 and the GPS has made an error about the terrain.

00:31:53.940 --> 00:31:55.220
 But that's more like a mapping error,

00:31:55.220 --> 00:31:56.220
 as far as I understand it.

00:31:56.220 --> 00:31:57.060
 - Okay.

00:31:57.060 --> 00:31:58.620
 - But there is a thing where in the early days of GPS,

00:31:58.620 --> 00:31:59.900
 you could either have good GPS,

00:31:59.900 --> 00:32:01.420
 which the American government had,

00:32:01.420 --> 00:32:02.620
 or you could have crap GPS,

00:32:02.620 --> 00:32:04.180
 which the rest of the world had,

00:32:04.180 --> 00:32:05.660
 apart from a few select allies.

00:32:05.660 --> 00:32:07.740
 And there was, it was called either,

00:32:07.740 --> 00:32:08.560
 what was it called?

00:32:08.560 --> 00:32:10.780
 Standard positioning service, crap GPS,

00:32:10.780 --> 00:32:12.620
 or GPS premium.

00:32:12.620 --> 00:32:13.660
 (laughing)

00:32:13.660 --> 00:32:15.620
 - Where you have to be an ally of a map.

00:32:15.620 --> 00:32:19.260
 - Club GPS, but just $3.99 a month,

00:32:19.260 --> 00:32:20.260
 (laughing)

00:32:20.260 --> 00:32:22.340
 will give you loads of extra content,

00:32:22.340 --> 00:32:24.260
 will give you more suspects to target.

00:32:24.260 --> 00:32:25.580
 (laughing)

00:32:25.580 --> 00:32:29.500
 Yeah, but it was because they didn't want hostile nations,

00:32:29.500 --> 00:32:31.400
 having access to the kind of pinpoint accuracy

00:32:31.400 --> 00:32:32.700
 that the US government had.

00:32:32.700 --> 00:32:35.140
 - I'm suddenly picturing me and my wife in a car

00:32:35.140 --> 00:32:36.380
 taking the wrong turn,

00:32:36.380 --> 00:32:38.860
 pummeling straight off the edge of a cliff,

00:32:38.860 --> 00:32:41.700
 and our last words being, should've gone premium.

00:32:41.700 --> 00:32:43.540
 (laughing)

00:32:43.540 --> 00:32:47.340
 Can I tell you about a GPS service from 1916?

00:32:47.340 --> 00:32:48.180
 - Oh yeah, wow.

00:32:48.180 --> 00:32:50.740
 - It was a Manhattan chauffeur called George Boyden,

00:32:50.740 --> 00:32:53.300
 and he painted this new technique.

00:32:53.300 --> 00:32:56.660
 And what it was, there would be a phonograph in your car,

00:32:56.660 --> 00:33:00.060
 and it would play recordings, say turn left now,

00:33:00.060 --> 00:33:02.740
 or turn right, or go straight on.

00:33:02.740 --> 00:33:05.940
 And it would be attached to your wheels.

00:33:05.940 --> 00:33:08.380
 And after you've got a certain distance,

00:33:08.380 --> 00:33:11.140
 it would know to play turn left now.

00:33:11.140 --> 00:33:11.980
 Isn't that clever?

00:33:11.980 --> 00:33:13.060
 - That's incredible.

00:33:13.060 --> 00:33:15.800
 - Well, obviously the problem is, if you miss one turning.

00:33:15.800 --> 00:33:18.060
 (laughing)

00:33:18.060 --> 00:33:20.640
 (upbeat music)

00:33:20.640 --> 00:33:26.060
 - We need to move on to our final fact of the show,

00:33:26.060 --> 00:33:27.660
 and that is James.

00:33:27.660 --> 00:33:28.740
 - Okay, my fact this week,

00:33:28.740 --> 00:33:31.140
 is that playing ice hockey can make you talk

00:33:31.140 --> 00:33:32.680
 in a Canadian accent.

00:33:32.680 --> 00:33:35.580
 (laughing)

00:33:35.580 --> 00:33:37.860
 - So, okay, so this is,

00:33:37.860 --> 00:33:39.780
 you don't even need to be around Canadians,

00:33:39.780 --> 00:33:41.540
 you just are, you've picked up your--

00:33:41.540 --> 00:33:43.180
 - You don't need to be a boot them.

00:33:43.180 --> 00:33:44.700
 (laughing)

00:33:44.700 --> 00:33:46.540
 - God, that was a crowbar again.

00:33:46.540 --> 00:33:47.660
 - That's literally the only word,

00:33:47.660 --> 00:33:49.740
 like we've said this before, we came on stage early,

00:33:49.740 --> 00:33:52.420
 I can't say any Canadian sounding words.

00:33:52.420 --> 00:33:54.220
 - I think a boot is the only one anyone can,

00:33:54.220 --> 00:33:55.420
 and you've hogged it now, so.

00:33:55.420 --> 00:33:58.220
 - All right, so this is a linguist

00:33:58.220 --> 00:34:01.060
 at the University of Rochester called Andrew Bray,

00:34:01.060 --> 00:34:03.260
 and he started out by studying the evolution

00:34:03.260 --> 00:34:07.220
 of hockey jargon, and then whenever he told anyone

00:34:07.220 --> 00:34:09.220
 about the project, they kept saying to him,

00:34:09.220 --> 00:34:11.220
 "Well, why don't you actually look at why American

00:34:11.220 --> 00:34:14.140
 "hockey players start sounding like fake Canadians?"

00:34:14.140 --> 00:34:17.300
 And he decided, "Yeah, why not, let's do that.

00:34:17.300 --> 00:34:19.220
 "Everyone's asking it, I might as well."

00:34:19.220 --> 00:34:22.380
 And so he's interviewed a lot of people,

00:34:22.380 --> 00:34:24.860
 interviewed a lot of Americans, a lot of Canadians,

00:34:24.860 --> 00:34:29.140
 and he found that up until about the age of 14,

00:34:29.140 --> 00:34:31.700
 if you're American, you don't really sound that Canadian,

00:34:31.700 --> 00:34:33.660
 but from then on, you really do start sounding

00:34:33.660 --> 00:34:36.540
 more and more Canadian, and what he reckons is,

00:34:36.540 --> 00:34:40.140
 you pick up hockey terms, like ice hockey slang,

00:34:40.140 --> 00:34:41.900
 and you say that in a Canadian way,

00:34:41.900 --> 00:34:43.980
 because that's what all your peers are saying,

00:34:43.980 --> 00:34:47.260
 and it kind of seeps into the rest of your vocabulary.

00:34:47.260 --> 00:34:50.580
 - What a Canadian, I'm thinking, Zamboni.

00:34:50.580 --> 00:34:52.660
 - Oh, that's interesting, I think that was American,

00:34:52.660 --> 00:34:56.220
 actually, but there was, let's say, for instance,

00:34:56.220 --> 00:34:58.460
 a hockey arena is known as a barn,

00:34:58.460 --> 00:35:02.380
 and a puck is known as a biscuit in Canadian terms.

00:35:02.380 --> 00:35:04.580
 - Okay, and then the accent sort of follows along

00:35:04.580 --> 00:35:05.420
 after the words.

00:35:05.420 --> 00:35:06.660
 - Yeah, you pick up the odd word,

00:35:06.660 --> 00:35:08.220
 and you say the odd word in that accent,

00:35:08.220 --> 00:35:09.660
 and then slowly you just start saying

00:35:09.660 --> 00:35:10.980
 more and more in that accent.

00:35:10.980 --> 00:35:12.620
 - God, we're so impressionable,

00:35:12.620 --> 00:35:14.300
 it's embarrassing, isn't it?

00:35:14.300 --> 00:35:15.300
 - That's not about roles.

00:35:15.300 --> 00:35:19.260
 You know, Gary Oldman, one of the most famous actors

00:35:19.260 --> 00:35:21.140
 from Britain, he went over to America,

00:35:21.140 --> 00:35:23.060
 and he does a lot of movies where he speaks

00:35:23.060 --> 00:35:25.660
 in an English, sorry, in an American accent.

00:35:25.660 --> 00:35:29.500
 When he moved back here, he had to have a language coach,

00:35:29.500 --> 00:35:31.140
 and an accent coach, basically--

00:35:31.140 --> 00:35:32.300
 - Language coach?

00:35:32.300 --> 00:35:33.980
 What actor is that?

00:35:33.980 --> 00:35:35.180
 - That's Canadian.

00:35:35.180 --> 00:35:38.860
 Authentic.

00:35:38.860 --> 00:35:39.700
 Wobbeck.

00:35:39.700 --> 00:35:45.060
 So, yeah, he had to have someone to re-teach him.

00:35:45.060 --> 00:35:46.740
 - Re-teach him his accent.

00:35:46.740 --> 00:35:50.180
 - In Canadian English, there are interesting vowel shifts

00:35:50.180 --> 00:35:51.900
 that they do, and I had never heard of any of this,

00:35:51.900 --> 00:35:56.900
 but there's a boot, which they don't actually say a boot.

00:35:56.900 --> 00:35:58.620
 If you listen to them closely, they say the,

00:35:58.620 --> 00:36:00.860
 okay, I'm gonna try and explain this.

00:36:00.860 --> 00:36:05.060
 When you say the about, ow, is too sound, right?

00:36:05.060 --> 00:36:07.100
 It's ah, and then ooh.

00:36:07.100 --> 00:36:07.940
 - Ow.

00:36:07.940 --> 00:36:09.900
 - About.

00:36:09.900 --> 00:36:10.860
 That's it, slow down.

00:36:10.860 --> 00:36:12.700
 - Right.

00:36:12.700 --> 00:36:16.020
 - What's that all about, and then ooh, right?

00:36:16.020 --> 00:36:16.860
 - Yeah.

00:36:16.860 --> 00:36:19.620
 - All right, Professor Higgins, move us on.

00:36:19.620 --> 00:36:22.420
 - But in Canada, the diphthong, which is that bit of it,

00:36:22.420 --> 00:36:25.100
 it starts with an exclusively Canadian sound

00:36:25.100 --> 00:36:27.100
 that not only can most people not say,

00:36:27.100 --> 00:36:29.340
 you can't even write it down in the--

00:36:29.340 --> 00:36:30.300
 - Can you say it?

00:36:30.300 --> 00:36:31.140
 - Well--

00:36:31.140 --> 00:36:32.340
 - Can you try?

00:36:32.340 --> 00:36:34.060
 - Starts with something like air,

00:36:34.060 --> 00:36:35.540
 and it moves to something like ooh,

00:36:35.540 --> 00:36:37.540
 but it's not a boat or a boot.

00:36:37.540 --> 00:36:38.860
 - It's ow.

00:36:38.860 --> 00:36:40.180
 - Well, exactly.

00:36:40.180 --> 00:36:41.220
 - Do you know that King Charles

00:36:41.220 --> 00:36:42.980
 is gonna start talking like Mr. T?

00:36:42.980 --> 00:36:45.420
 - Mr. T?

00:36:45.420 --> 00:36:46.260
 - What?

00:36:46.260 --> 00:36:47.580
 - When?

00:36:47.580 --> 00:36:50.780
 - Sometime in the future, this was a paper I was reading

00:36:50.780 --> 00:36:53.540
 about something called the intrusive L,

00:36:53.540 --> 00:36:56.380
 and it's the fact that people often drop their Ls,

00:36:56.380 --> 00:36:59.180
 so Mr. T might say, I pity the fool.

00:36:59.180 --> 00:37:00.020
 - Yeah.

00:37:00.020 --> 00:37:02.820
 - They kind of hear the L, but he doesn't actually say it.

00:37:02.820 --> 00:37:03.660
 - I pity the fool.

00:37:03.660 --> 00:37:04.900
 - There's a few of things like people might say,

00:37:04.900 --> 00:37:05.940
 cool, cool, cool, cool.

00:37:05.940 --> 00:37:07.260
 But they don't actually say the L,

00:37:07.260 --> 00:37:08.500
 they're just saying, ooh, really.

00:37:08.500 --> 00:37:09.540
 - Oh, right.

00:37:09.540 --> 00:37:10.380
 - If you say--

00:37:10.380 --> 00:37:11.580
 - Like, fool fighters, right?

00:37:11.580 --> 00:37:14.020
 That's, we call them, we call them.

00:37:14.020 --> 00:37:15.900
 (laughing)

00:37:15.900 --> 00:37:18.580
 - Yeah, or I'm just, I'm going to the zoo today.

00:37:18.580 --> 00:37:19.420
 - Yeah.

00:37:19.420 --> 00:37:20.340
 (laughing)

00:37:20.340 --> 00:37:22.300
 - You know what, it's really interesting about that.

00:37:22.300 --> 00:37:24.980
 So apparently, according to the paper that I said,

00:37:24.980 --> 00:37:26.740
 it's basically an unstoppable trend,

00:37:26.740 --> 00:37:28.180
 and even the British royal family

00:37:28.180 --> 00:37:30.500
 is eventually going to speak like that.

00:37:30.500 --> 00:37:33.020
 But the really interesting thing is in Bristol,

00:37:33.020 --> 00:37:36.260
 they add an L, and they kind of overcompensate,

00:37:36.260 --> 00:37:37.660
 they over-correct.

00:37:37.660 --> 00:37:39.980
 They know that people often drop their Ls,

00:37:39.980 --> 00:37:42.860
 and so they'll add Ls where they shouldn't really be one.

00:37:42.860 --> 00:37:45.140
 And so there are some people in Bristol,

00:37:45.140 --> 00:37:47.820
 mostly older people, who might, instead of saying idea,

00:37:47.820 --> 00:37:51.140
 they'll say ideal, or they might say, instead of piano,

00:37:51.140 --> 00:37:52.140
 they say piano.

00:37:52.140 --> 00:37:52.980
 - Piano.

00:37:52.980 --> 00:37:54.140
 - It's not exactly a full L,

00:37:54.140 --> 00:37:55.780
 but it's kind of a slight L on it.

00:37:55.780 --> 00:37:58.220
 - And your logic is that they're trying to,

00:37:58.220 --> 00:38:00.020
 like there are lots of homeless Ls now,

00:38:00.020 --> 00:38:01.900
 that have been dropped of other people's speech,

00:38:01.900 --> 00:38:04.820
 and the good people of Bristol are trying to re-home them.

00:38:04.820 --> 00:38:06.260
 - Are they going to be the last people

00:38:06.260 --> 00:38:07.980
 to stand against the disappearing L?

00:38:07.980 --> 00:38:09.580
 - Well, presumably there'll be some other people

00:38:09.580 --> 00:38:11.260
 who kind of overcompensate as well.

00:38:11.260 --> 00:38:13.820
 But this is true, and it's so true in Bristol,

00:38:13.820 --> 00:38:17.460
 that the city of Bristol was originally called Brixto,

00:38:17.460 --> 00:38:21.020
 and the people of Bristol started saying Brixto,

00:38:21.020 --> 00:38:22.980
 and they added the L to Brixto,

00:38:22.980 --> 00:38:24.180
 and that's how they got the name.

00:38:24.180 --> 00:38:27.420
 So the name of the entire city comes from this overcompensator

00:38:27.420 --> 00:38:29.340
 and adding Ls at the end of words.

00:38:29.340 --> 00:38:30.820
 - Oh my God.

00:38:30.820 --> 00:38:31.660
 - Isn't that cool?

00:38:31.660 --> 00:38:33.580
 - Overcompensating for what, though?

00:38:33.580 --> 00:38:35.540
 - Yeah, all right, it's lovely, Bristol.

00:38:35.540 --> 00:38:36.740
 - You literally just explained it,

00:38:36.740 --> 00:38:38.660
 but it's still worth saying.

00:38:38.660 --> 00:38:40.740
 - It's the thing that I do of adding Rs,

00:38:40.740 --> 00:38:41.580
 where they don't belong.

00:38:41.580 --> 00:38:42.420
 - Oh, no, no.

00:38:42.420 --> 00:38:43.620
 - Americans do.

00:38:43.620 --> 00:38:46.340
 - But no American says Chicago, which is what I say.

00:38:46.340 --> 00:38:47.180
 - No, no, no one does.

00:38:47.180 --> 00:38:50.660
 - But you have an international accent that's sort of--

00:38:50.660 --> 00:38:53.020
 - I would say some Bristolians might say that.

00:38:53.020 --> 00:38:53.860
 - Chicago?

00:38:53.860 --> 00:38:57.300
 - But again, not like that.

00:38:57.300 --> 00:38:58.380
 Never like that.

00:38:58.380 --> 00:39:01.380
 - It's a very different musical.

00:39:01.380 --> 00:39:07.620
 - Yeah, she was right to shoot him, yeah.

00:39:07.620 --> 00:39:10.340
 - Name me a vowel.

00:39:10.340 --> 00:39:11.180
 Just name a vowel.

00:39:11.180 --> 00:39:12.460
 - Oh, I can't think of any now.

00:39:12.460 --> 00:39:13.300
 - Hi.

00:39:13.300 --> 00:39:14.260
 - Hi, brilliant, one.

00:39:14.260 --> 00:39:15.100
 - Yur.

00:39:15.100 --> 00:39:18.020
 - You, you, I, you, okay.

00:39:18.020 --> 00:39:18.860
 - E.

00:39:18.860 --> 00:39:19.700
 - E.

00:39:19.700 --> 00:39:21.700
 - I mean, we know the five.

00:39:21.700 --> 00:39:22.540
 - O.

00:39:22.540 --> 00:39:23.380
 - And A.

00:39:23.380 --> 00:39:24.460
 - A, brilliant.

00:39:24.460 --> 00:39:26.300
 - Where's the sixth?

00:39:26.300 --> 00:39:27.140
 - There's a sixth one.

00:39:27.140 --> 00:39:28.100
 - Y?

00:39:28.100 --> 00:39:29.900
 - Nope, it's not Y.

00:39:29.900 --> 00:39:30.740
 - Oh.

00:39:30.740 --> 00:39:31.580
 - Is it R?

00:39:31.580 --> 00:39:32.420
 - R.

00:39:32.420 --> 00:39:37.220
 - Get this, R, technically, is a vowel.

00:39:37.220 --> 00:39:38.780
 It's the secret sixth vowel.

00:39:38.780 --> 00:39:39.860
 What's a consonant, right?

00:39:39.860 --> 00:39:41.540
 You are closing something off in your mouth.

00:39:41.540 --> 00:39:43.860
 You're using your lips or your teeth or your tongue,

00:39:43.860 --> 00:39:45.740
 and you are closing something off.

00:39:45.740 --> 00:39:48.940
 F, or, someone just said, I agree, out of nowhere.

00:39:48.940 --> 00:39:52.340
 Right, that's what a consonant is,

00:39:52.340 --> 00:39:54.660
 but a vowel, you're an open tube.

00:39:54.660 --> 00:39:55.780
 Your mouth is an open tube.

00:39:55.780 --> 00:39:56.620
 - Okay.

00:39:56.620 --> 00:39:59.300
 - And you are, you're changing the shape of the tube,

00:39:59.300 --> 00:40:03.700
 but it's like, A, E, I, O, U.

00:40:03.700 --> 00:40:05.420
 They're all, the tube is open,

00:40:05.420 --> 00:40:08.060
 and R is the same.

00:40:08.060 --> 00:40:08.900
 - Right.

00:40:08.900 --> 00:40:10.860
 What's the really cool Spanish one where they say,

00:40:10.860 --> 00:40:12.180
 (speaking foreign language)

00:40:12.180 --> 00:40:13.020
 - That thing.

00:40:13.020 --> 00:40:16.980
 - We are wandering dangerously close.

00:40:16.980 --> 00:40:18.060
 - Well, no, I can't do it,

00:40:18.060 --> 00:40:19.900
 and it's so exciting every time I hit it.

00:40:19.900 --> 00:40:21.740
 - What is, what is it?

00:40:21.740 --> 00:40:23.660
 - You mean where they kind of lisp the lips?

00:40:23.660 --> 00:40:25.020
 - Yeah, like, mythically.

00:40:25.020 --> 00:40:26.940
 - There was a theory that that was,

00:40:26.940 --> 00:40:29.300
 that people were trying to copy a king, wasn't it?

00:40:29.300 --> 00:40:30.140
 - Really?

00:40:30.140 --> 00:40:31.900
 - One of the kings supposedly had a lisp.

00:40:31.900 --> 00:40:33.900
 - Every time I hear it, I just think that's such talent.

00:40:33.900 --> 00:40:35.860
 - I think, I feel like that was a while ago,

00:40:35.860 --> 00:40:38.820
 but speaking of people talking in an offensive manner,

00:40:38.820 --> 00:40:42.100
 (audience laughing)

00:40:42.100 --> 00:40:43.900
 and speaking of fake accents,

00:40:43.900 --> 00:40:47.140
 in the 1800s, late 1800s, early 1900s,

00:40:47.140 --> 00:40:50.260
 wealthier people used to throw poverty parties

00:40:50.260 --> 00:40:52.220
 and call them poverty parties.

00:40:52.220 --> 00:40:54.220
 And the invitations would say,

00:40:54.220 --> 00:40:57.220
 you are only allowed to wear rags and sacks

00:40:57.220 --> 00:41:00.420
 and your worst cloth and will only be served,

00:41:00.420 --> 00:41:01.940
 I think it was just an excuse not to serve

00:41:01.940 --> 00:41:03.780
 expensive canapes, it was like,

00:41:03.780 --> 00:41:06.740
 we will only serve stale bread and water.

00:41:06.740 --> 00:41:10.820
 And people would come and put on working class accents.

00:41:10.820 --> 00:41:12.380
 So this was a fashionable thing,

00:41:12.380 --> 00:41:13.620
 and there were lots of invitations.

00:41:13.620 --> 00:41:15.940
 And Irish especially, it was in America.

00:41:15.940 --> 00:41:19.260
 And so an Irish accent was seen to be quite working class,

00:41:19.260 --> 00:41:21.220
 full of Irish immigrants at the time,

00:41:21.220 --> 00:41:23.380
 and posh people turned up to parties

00:41:23.380 --> 00:41:26.500
 and had to speak the whole night in an Irish accent.

00:41:26.500 --> 00:41:27.340
 - Wow.

00:41:27.340 --> 00:41:29.020
 - That's a full party of canceled people.

00:41:29.020 --> 00:41:29.860
 - Yeah, that's amazing.

00:41:29.860 --> 00:41:30.700
 - Right there.

00:41:30.700 --> 00:41:31.540
 - That is weird.

00:41:31.540 --> 00:41:32.380
 - Yeah.

00:41:32.380 --> 00:41:33.820
 - Garcia, Garcia.

00:41:33.820 --> 00:41:34.820
 - You've been letting him.

00:41:34.820 --> 00:41:36.180
 (audience laughing)

00:41:36.180 --> 00:41:39.100
 - Your invoice in the post, Dan, you're already in.

00:41:39.100 --> 00:41:40.820
 - Do you know somewhere where you can be killed

00:41:40.820 --> 00:41:42.580
 for doing the wrong accent?

00:41:42.580 --> 00:41:43.420
 - The dance chair.

00:41:43.420 --> 00:41:46.940
 (audience laughing)

00:41:46.940 --> 00:41:49.980
 - This is the ant nest beetle.

00:41:49.980 --> 00:41:52.700
 And it is a beetle that goes into ants nests

00:41:52.700 --> 00:41:56.780
 and is able to mimic the ants chemical signatures.

00:41:56.780 --> 00:41:59.220
 But it's able to do lots of different ones.

00:41:59.220 --> 00:42:01.300
 And so if you're an ant that lives over here

00:42:01.300 --> 00:42:02.380
 or one that lives over here,

00:42:02.380 --> 00:42:03.620
 or maybe another species of ant,

00:42:03.620 --> 00:42:05.700
 it can change it very, very slightly.

00:42:05.700 --> 00:42:08.620
 So it gets all the different dialects of ant.

00:42:08.620 --> 00:42:10.860
 And if it gets it even slightly wrong,

00:42:10.860 --> 00:42:12.540
 the ants will kill them and eat them.

00:42:12.540 --> 00:42:13.380
 - Really?

00:42:13.380 --> 00:42:14.620
 - Oh, that's incredible.

00:42:14.620 --> 00:42:16.380
 - Even it's just like saying tomato

00:42:16.380 --> 00:42:17.460
 instead of tomato.

00:42:17.460 --> 00:42:18.800
 - Tomato.

00:42:18.800 --> 00:42:20.900
 - So they can't get drunk at all.

00:42:20.900 --> 00:42:21.740
 - No.

00:42:21.740 --> 00:42:24.020
 - Accidentally drop a tea and that's it.

00:42:24.020 --> 00:42:24.860
 Well, that's pretty interesting

00:42:24.860 --> 00:42:26.580
 because there's a lot of talk

00:42:26.580 --> 00:42:28.940
 about whether animals have accents or not.

00:42:28.940 --> 00:42:30.180
 - It's always claimed, right?

00:42:30.180 --> 00:42:32.380
 - What the definition of an accent is.

00:42:32.380 --> 00:42:35.460
 And there was a big story that went around about cows

00:42:35.460 --> 00:42:38.940
 having regional accents a few years ago.

00:42:38.940 --> 00:42:41.860
 - Ducks as well having regional accents.

00:42:41.860 --> 00:42:45.180
 - Well, I think that had more truth to it in 2006.

00:42:45.180 --> 00:42:46.620
 And I think we might have said this

00:42:46.620 --> 00:42:47.740
 'cause it was reported everywhere.

00:42:47.740 --> 00:42:50.540
 It was reported that cows moo in regional accents.

00:42:50.540 --> 00:42:53.740
 And it turns out that was just a big PR thing

00:42:53.740 --> 00:42:56.260
 from West Country Farmhouse Cheese Makers

00:42:56.260 --> 00:42:58.100
 - Really?

00:42:58.100 --> 00:42:59.740
 - To try and sell more cheese.

00:42:59.740 --> 00:43:03.020
 So, and they quoted this professor, John Wells,

00:43:03.020 --> 00:43:05.060
 who was a professor of phonetics at UCL,

00:43:05.060 --> 00:43:08.780
 who kept on saying, "I never said this."

00:43:08.780 --> 00:43:10.780
 These cheese guys called me and they said,

00:43:10.780 --> 00:43:12.780
 "Do you think cows moo in regional accents?"

00:43:12.780 --> 00:43:15.580
 And he said, "I think it's incredibly unlikely."

00:43:15.580 --> 00:43:18.060
 And they kept on saying, "But is it possible?"

00:43:18.060 --> 00:43:22.420
 And he said, "Well, birds do exhibit regional variants."

00:43:22.420 --> 00:43:23.940
 Yep, we'll take that as a yes.

00:43:23.940 --> 00:43:27.500
 - Oh my God, his career has presumably been ruined.

00:43:27.500 --> 00:43:29.100
 No one's talking to him.

00:43:29.100 --> 00:43:30.220
 None of the cows are talking to him

00:43:30.220 --> 00:43:31.540
 at any of the conferences.

00:43:31.540 --> 00:43:36.100
 Do you know what the most attractive accent is?

00:43:36.100 --> 00:43:37.940
 And this is a physiological thing.

00:43:37.940 --> 00:43:38.780
 - Oh, okay.

00:43:38.780 --> 00:43:41.060
 - What makes your heart go pitter-patter?

00:43:41.060 --> 00:43:42.660
 - Well, we've all got opinions.

00:43:42.660 --> 00:43:43.500
 - Wow.

00:43:43.500 --> 00:43:44.580
 - A Barcelona.

00:43:44.580 --> 00:43:47.580
 (audience laughing)

00:43:47.580 --> 00:43:54.260
 - Yeah, that's, oh.

00:43:54.260 --> 00:43:56.820
 - I'm feeling warm, yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:43:56.820 --> 00:43:59.300
 - Used to be an attractive accent.

00:43:59.300 --> 00:44:02.100
 - I think this was a study of European accents,

00:44:02.100 --> 00:44:03.140
 in particular, done by--

00:44:03.140 --> 00:44:05.140
 - Most people would say French, right?

00:44:05.140 --> 00:44:05.980
 - Most people would say French.

00:44:05.980 --> 00:44:08.140
 And this was an online language tutor called Preply.

00:44:08.140 --> 00:44:10.420
 They attached heart rate monitors to 1,000 adults

00:44:10.420 --> 00:44:13.060
 and they played them pre-recorded chat-up lines.

00:44:13.060 --> 00:44:14.900
 I presume the same in every language.

00:44:14.900 --> 00:44:15.820
 - Yeah, right.

00:44:15.820 --> 00:44:17.540
 - And it found that being chatted up

00:44:17.540 --> 00:44:21.060
 in an Italian accent makes men and women's heart rates

00:44:21.060 --> 00:44:22.660
 rise by 23%.

00:44:22.660 --> 00:44:23.500
 - Really?

00:44:23.500 --> 00:44:24.340
 - 15 beats a minute higher

00:44:24.340 --> 00:44:27.700
 if you're getting that sweet, sweet Italian telling up.

00:44:27.700 --> 00:44:29.180
 - That's a lot of beats, actually.

00:44:29.180 --> 00:44:30.700
 - Come and stay with my mother.

00:44:30.700 --> 00:44:31.540
 - No.

00:44:31.540 --> 00:44:34.460
 (audience laughing)

00:44:34.460 --> 00:44:35.780
 - That's nice.

00:44:35.780 --> 00:44:38.020
 - So you actually ruined an entire nation for me.

00:44:38.020 --> 00:44:39.180
 (audience laughing)

00:44:39.180 --> 00:44:40.020
 - I am.

00:44:40.020 --> 00:44:41.140
 - I'm gonna need to move a song.

00:44:41.140 --> 00:44:41.980
 - What?

00:44:41.980 --> 00:44:42.820
 - Yeah, I'm afraid.

00:44:42.820 --> 00:44:43.660
 - You're done.

00:44:43.660 --> 00:44:44.660
 - English is the least sexy, sorry.

00:44:44.660 --> 00:44:45.500
 - Okay.

00:44:45.500 --> 00:44:46.340
 (audience laughing)

00:44:46.340 --> 00:44:47.180
 - Well, come and see my mother.

00:44:47.180 --> 00:44:49.300
 (audience laughing)

00:44:49.300 --> 00:44:52.300
 (audience clapping)

00:44:52.300 --> 00:44:57.680
 (upbeat music)

00:44:57.680 --> 00:45:01.860
 - All right, listen, we need to wrap up our show.

00:45:01.860 --> 00:45:03.020
 Okay, that is it.

00:45:03.020 --> 00:45:04.020
 That is all of our facts.

00:45:04.020 --> 00:45:05.460
 Thank you so much for listening.

00:45:05.460 --> 00:45:07.420

 All of our previous episodes are up there.

00:45:34.260 --> 00:45:37.140
 There's also links to the secret club, Clubfish.

00:45:37.140 --> 00:45:39.460
 No one has checked that out yet, do check that out.

00:45:39.460 --> 00:45:40.700
 And of course, we're gonna be on tour.

00:45:40.700 --> 00:45:43.900
 We're going around a lot of bits of the earth

00:45:43.900 --> 00:45:45.940
 and we are gonna have fun dorking out

00:45:45.940 --> 00:45:47.940
 for our 10th year with Thunder Nerds.

00:45:47.940 --> 00:45:50.340
 Thank you so much, everyone, for coming here tonight.

00:45:50.340 --> 00:45:51.860
 We really appreciate it.

00:45:51.860 --> 00:45:52.940
 That was fun as hell.

00:45:52.940 --> 00:45:54.060
 We'll see you again.

00:45:54.060 --> 00:45:54.900
 Goodbye!

00:45:55.020 --> 00:45:57.600
