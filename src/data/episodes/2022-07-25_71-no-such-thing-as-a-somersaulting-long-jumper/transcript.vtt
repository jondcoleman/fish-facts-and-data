00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:25.040
 And welcome to another episode, a no such thing as a fish, this week coming to you from

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:30.480
 the literary arena in the Latitude Festival. My name is Dan Schreiber. I'm sitting here

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:35.680
 with three other QILs. It's Aniches Insky, Andy Murray, and James Harkin. And once again,

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:38.960
 we've gathered around the microphones with our four favorite facts from the last seven

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:44.320
 days. And in a particular order, here we go. And we're going to start with my fact this week.

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:50.960
 My fact this week is that the world record for horse long jump is shorter than the world record

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:57.680
 for human long jump. That just can't even be true. That just is so obviously not true at some

00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:02.880
 believer. No, it's absolutely true. But here's the weird thing. Horse long jump. Did anyone know

00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:08.480
 that existed? It was an Olympic sport for one year. I have a question about the horse long jump.

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:12.720
 Did they have to do it with a human on their back? Yes. Well then of course they're going to

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:18.160
 let if you put a if you put a horse on a human's back. That's not a fair comparison though. You

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:23.840
 need to put so it'd be like strapping a child to your back maybe. Okay. Which wouldn't be allowed,

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:28.480
 I guess. No. But listen horses. Okay, how many how many people here just by show a hand, a surprise

00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:33.840
 that humans can jump further than horses? Yeah, pretty much everyone. Yeah. And when you say

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:40.000
 surprised, none of them believe you. Okay, so this is absolutely true. You can go online to Wikipedia.

00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:50.640
 So this was in the 1900s. Your niche sources for these. So 1900 at the Olympics, they did the horse

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:58.000
 drum. The guy riding the horse was called constant van Langhendonk and his horse was called

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:05.440
 extra dry and he jumped as far as he jumped about six meters and that's not actually the horse record.

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:09.520
 So that was just their first ever attempt at the Olympics. Everyone said let's not do that again.

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:14.560
 Let's move on. Let's never speak about this. So the world record as it stands was set in 1975 by

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:20.960
 horse. The horse was called something. What was it called? Something. The horse was actually called

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:27.040
 something. That was the actual name of the horse by Mr Andre Ferreira and they jumped 8.4 meters.

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:34.320
 So that's the horse record. The human record is 8.95 meters. Yeah. And that was set in 1991 by

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:39.200
 guy called Mike Powell. It's still holding to this day as the longest human jump. What about height?

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:43.840
 Can they jump? Can we jump higher than horses or can they jump higher than us? I think the horses

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:50.320
 can go higher. Can they? Yeah. Well, I've looked it up. Oh, really? And there is an official high jump

00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:57.040
 record for horses and it's two meters 47 and the official high jump record for humans is two meters

00:02:57.040 --> 00:03:04.560
 45. So they can beat us by two centimeters. Wow. But do they know that we're asking them to jump

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:09.120
 really high? There's the problem. There's a big fence in the way that gives a bit of a clue.

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:16.000
 Yeah. They just don't have the like competitive urge, you know, they don't know that they need to win.

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:19.920
 That's true. That's the thing that we do. But the thing is with human high jump is there was a

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:23.920
 massive difference was that when Dick Fosbury came in and did his Fosbury flop, which is going over

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:29.760
 backwards. And until then the record was a certain amount and then it went massively up in a really

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:35.040
 short amount of time. And what's interesting with him is he was the in the America, he went gold in

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:42.000
 the Olympics in 1968. But by 1970 he wasn't even in the Olympic team anymore because everyone else

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:45.840
 had seen his tactic and gone, that's amazing. And he wasn't even that good at high jumper.

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:49.680
 Really? It's just the technique. Yeah, just the technique. That's the only thing that did it. He

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:55.040
 wasn't even that good. So long jump was almost the opposite right because the long jump record until

00:03:55.040 --> 00:04:00.560
 it was broken by Mike Powell in 1991 was held for I think a record length of time in the Olympics. So

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:07.360
 it was broken in 1968 by Robert Beaumont. And he just did this incredible long jump. So the record

00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:14.480
 up until then had been 21 feet and three quarters of an inch. And then in 1968 he jumped 29 feet

00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:19.280
 and 2.5 inches. And he jumped so far that they couldn't record it properly because they didn't have

00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:22.720
 the equipment to stretch that far. They didn't have the equipment to stretch them. Yeah. How I

00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:26.640
 didn't know how advanced the equipment has to be. In order for you to buy another one meter ruler

00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:32.480
 to measure the amount of people. So I think he jumped 29 feet. I think this with long jumps is

00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:36.080
 they record. Some people record. I don't know if it's true. Some people record you could go further

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:40.240
 if you do a sum of salt while you're jumping. That makes sense. But there's a rule that says you're

00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:45.520
 not allowed. The rule is very clear. It says the jumper's head has to stay in a superior position

00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:50.240
 during the jump. So your head has to be always the highest point. But why has someone done it and

00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:55.120
 they've gone further? Well they said that it was maybe due to it being dangerous. But the actual

00:04:55.120 --> 00:05:00.160
 reason that they said they jumped band it when they did is that nobody would jump a puddle in this way.

00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:05.440
 So apparently that's what we're doing with a long jump. It's just a way of jumping a puddle.

00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:10.800
 Good Olympic reasoning. Do you want to hear something else that happened at the 1900 Olympics?

00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:17.520
 Yes, please. Men's underwater swimming. So start underwater and you just keep going

00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:20.960
 until you have to come up and you get a point for every second you're underwater and you get a point

00:05:20.960 --> 00:05:25.520
 for every meter you swim underwater. It was never held again because of, and I quote,

00:05:25.520 --> 00:05:32.720
 a lack of spectator appeal. Actually they're kind of bringing that back you know because they found

00:05:32.720 --> 00:05:37.280
 that swimming underwater is quicker than swimming freestyle. Yeah, it's called the fish kick.

00:05:37.280 --> 00:05:42.080
 Yeah, yeah, yeah. And it's the first time they found a new swimming stroke which is faster than

00:05:42.080 --> 00:05:47.600
 freestyle. The first time it's happened in hundreds of years. Yeah, it's really cool. It's literally

00:05:47.600 --> 00:05:51.120
 moving your hips really, really far and you know moving your arms around. You look like a fish when

00:05:51.120 --> 00:05:58.960
 you're doing it. Yeah, yeah. There's another so horse long jump has been abandoned as an Olympic sport.

00:05:58.960 --> 00:06:04.160
 There's a list of other Olympic sports that we no longer do. This is my favourite one. Solo

00:06:04.160 --> 00:06:11.760
 synchronized swimming. And that was for three Olympics. Just one person in a pool with music,

00:06:11.760 --> 00:06:18.720
 love it. And eventually they thought it's just not working for us. That's amazing. That's so cool.

00:06:18.720 --> 00:06:24.080
 Another thing they had at the 1900 Olympics was so they were really into horse events at that

00:06:24.080 --> 00:06:30.000
 Olympics I think and they had the male coach event which was basically who can deliver post

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:36.480
 the fastest and was so there's the four in hand male coach event and it was four horses on a male

00:06:36.480 --> 00:06:42.080
 coach and you know you've got your letters and it was a race and the guy who won it actually was

00:06:42.080 --> 00:06:47.040
 the guy who then went on to found the Orion Express company weirdly so he was the guy behind

00:06:47.040 --> 00:06:52.000
 Orion Express train. You'll have seen some of my work in the Olympics. That's very cool. Have you

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:56.960
 heard of Margaret Abbott? No. She was an art student from America, right? She won in the 1900

00:06:56.960 --> 00:07:01.840
 Olympics. She won a nine-hole golf tournament but she didn't know it was an Olympic event.

00:07:01.840 --> 00:07:09.920
 She died 55 years later still not knowing that she was America's first female Olympic champion.

00:07:09.920 --> 00:07:16.000
 I know. No one told her at any point. How did she get into the Olympics then? I don't know.

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:19.680
 They're all these sort of weird half Olympic events. So the male coach I think they've decided

00:07:19.680 --> 00:07:24.160
 now it wasn't a technically Olympic event and all of this stuff. There's all this sort of shadow

00:07:24.160 --> 00:07:27.840
 Olympics. And the whole time I jump I think that same event was decided it didn't count as an

00:07:27.840 --> 00:07:32.320
 Olympic event but the horse long jump did. Because horses jumped, I think they jumped just over six

00:07:32.320 --> 00:07:37.600
 foot at that. Oh, it's a thing. Which yeah. So the modern Olympics, you know it disappeared for

00:07:37.600 --> 00:07:40.960
 a long time. Obviously someone brought it back and the person who brought it back, one of the main

00:07:40.960 --> 00:07:47.680
 people was a guy called Baron D. Kubaton. So Baron D. Kubaton decided when he set it up that he

00:07:47.680 --> 00:07:53.680
 was going to award an Olympic gold. So someone won this in the Olympics for literature, right?

00:07:53.680 --> 00:07:58.560
 So there was a whole arts category that happened with the Olympics, which they've since dropped.

00:07:58.560 --> 00:08:04.160
 But so they did it in all different things. They did it in sculpture, architecture, in poetry.

00:08:04.160 --> 00:08:09.120
 But do you know who won the poetry award? No. He did. Did he? Did he?

00:08:09.120 --> 00:08:15.280
 He was no good at sports but he set up the Olympics and he's like, well, how am I going to win a gold

00:08:15.280 --> 00:08:20.320
 medal then? And so he sets up poetry and then he did a poem himself and he won. He won a gold medal.

00:08:20.320 --> 00:08:24.240
 Guys, I really, really think we should have a poetry competition in the Olympics. I know it's

00:08:24.240 --> 00:08:30.000
 kind of sporty but, you know, it was meant to be the whole thing. 1948 was the last London Olympics

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:36.800
 before 2012. That was the last time they had architecture and was it sculpting? Town planning.

00:08:36.800 --> 00:08:43.200
 Town planning. I've got the town planning. There was a little Olympic medal for town planning.

00:08:43.200 --> 00:08:45.280
 Yeah, but it was solo town planning. That was very important.

00:08:47.040 --> 00:08:54.640
 So they also had it for painting and graphic art. So I've got the gold silver and bronze winners

00:08:54.640 --> 00:09:02.640
 of the 1948 painting and graphic art competition. So in it bronze was a guy called Alex Diglman

00:09:02.640 --> 00:09:08.800
 from Switzerland who won it for his graphic art world championship for ice hockey poster.

00:09:08.800 --> 00:09:16.800
 Silver was Alex Diglman from Switzerland for world championship for cycling poster. Gold medal

00:09:17.520 --> 00:09:28.400
 to no one. That is brutal. Can you imagine losing to nobody?

00:09:28.400 --> 00:09:34.000
 So the Olympic art had to be art that was about Olympic sports presumably.

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:37.760
 Everything had to be about the Olympics. Imagine having to tell him that he won silver

00:09:37.760 --> 00:09:41.200
 and he'd be really excited and he'd say oh that's great. I'm so made up to one silver.

00:09:41.200 --> 00:09:48.560
 Who got gold? Yeah, little thing Alex. There is an interesting thing. They did a study of faces

00:09:48.560 --> 00:09:54.320
 of people who are doing races who do running races in the Olympics and they could tell how happy

00:09:54.320 --> 00:10:00.640
 people were by how smiley they were on the podium and anyone who came second was much more miserable

00:10:00.640 --> 00:10:04.560
 than whoever came third. They found that out because the people who came second presumably are

00:10:04.560 --> 00:10:08.960
 really upset because they just just missed out on gold and the people who came thirded well

00:10:08.960 --> 00:10:14.240
 I got something at least. James told us this great thing the other day

00:10:14.240 --> 00:10:19.200
 about you saying bolts. What was that quiz question that you said about him breaking the 100 meters?

00:10:19.200 --> 00:10:25.280
 Oh yeah. Well his fastest ever 100 meters is a lot faster than World Record and that's because

00:10:25.280 --> 00:10:30.640
 the second half of his 200 meters he'd already had a running start and so I think he beat

00:10:30.640 --> 00:10:35.360
 9 seconds for 100 meters. But he was already running. He was already starting. He had a really

00:10:35.360 --> 00:10:40.320
 start. Yeah. But when he broke their 100 meters World Record he had one of his shoes untied.

00:10:40.320 --> 00:10:44.720
 One of his shoelaces untied. No way. That's how good he is. Yeah. That would be so distracting.

00:10:44.720 --> 00:10:48.800
 How did he not stop? I'm sure he wasn't looking at it the whole time.

00:10:48.800 --> 00:10:54.160
 Should I deal with this? Did he stop and tie it up? Yeah he still broke the record in spite of

00:10:54.160 --> 00:10:57.200
 stopping to tie it up halfway through. That would not be double knot or. Yeah.

00:10:57.200 --> 00:11:02.720
 When he does 100 meters his feet are touching the ground for I think two seconds

00:11:03.360 --> 00:11:11.440
 and in the whole race. Wow. Wow. Do you want to know something else about the long jump in ancient

00:11:11.440 --> 00:11:15.600
 Greece? It was so hard that you were allowed to have weights so you held these weights and you sort

00:11:15.600 --> 00:11:20.640
 of threw them behind yourself as you jump forward. Also the ancient Greek long jump was so tricky

00:11:20.640 --> 00:11:25.200
 that you were allowed to have a flute playing so you could keep time with it as you did your jump.

00:11:25.200 --> 00:11:29.120
 That was that concession. We know this is really hard so we'll give you a flute player

00:11:29.120 --> 00:11:34.240
 to make it a bit easier. What's so the flute played a rhythm? Yeah yeah the flute would play

00:11:34.240 --> 00:11:38.640
 in time so that you could make your jump. I do feel like between flute playing and steroids

00:11:38.640 --> 00:11:43.040
 you'd probably go over the last of it. We understand this is hard. You can have an orchestra

00:11:43.040 --> 00:11:48.160
 accompanying you. Awesome performance. You're going to be tested for flutes obviously for liars

00:11:48.160 --> 00:11:52.480
 all kinds of stuff. We're going to have to move on to our second fact. Does anyone have anything

00:11:52.480 --> 00:11:59.040
 else before we do? No. Okay. Time for our second fact and that is Chisinski. Yeah my

00:11:59.040 --> 00:12:04.400
 fact is that every time Alfred Hitchcock had a cup of tea he always smashed the tea cup.

00:12:04.400 --> 00:12:10.480
 That was what he did. Always. Well apparently every morning he'd have his cup of tea before he

00:12:10.480 --> 00:12:16.160
 went off to work and he'd drink the tea, smash the tea cup, go to work, he'd drink tea in the studio

00:12:16.160 --> 00:12:22.800
 through tea cups at the wall and it was just his tea drinking habit. He sounds very difficult

00:12:22.800 --> 00:12:28.320
 doesn't he? He's a madman. He was a madman. Someone wrote a biography recently about him saying he was

00:12:28.320 --> 00:12:32.880
 doing it to remind himself of the frailty of human life. So he throws a tea cup against the wall

00:12:32.880 --> 00:12:39.760
 and thinks that's like me dying. But he just did it. He used the punch light bulbs out quite a long

00:12:39.760 --> 00:12:45.440
 set as well. That's how we turned off lights. He turned the light on and then he just punch it

00:12:45.440 --> 00:12:51.680
 until it stopped giving out light. And actually speaking of horses he was really good friends with

00:12:51.680 --> 00:12:59.840
 Gerald DeMaurier who was definitely DeMaurier's dad and Gerald DeMaurier was an actor and at one point

00:12:59.840 --> 00:13:04.880
 Alfred Hitchcock while Gerald DeMaurier was out on stage performing a play Alfred Hitchcock somehow

00:13:04.880 --> 00:13:11.200
 nobody knows how had a horse delivered to his dressing room so Gerald came back at the interval

00:13:11.200 --> 00:13:16.000
 or whatever while he was performing went into his dressing room and there was a huge horse there

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:20.160
 and he didn't know what to do with it and no one knows how I got there and I don't know how he

00:13:20.160 --> 00:13:26.240
 removed it. He was a bit of a prankster wasn't he? He loved practical jokes. One of the things he used

00:13:26.240 --> 00:13:31.840
 to do was he would get into a lift with a friend of his who told amazing stories and then he would

00:13:31.840 --> 00:13:37.040
 start to tell this incredible, incredible story and then as soon as the doors opened he would get

00:13:37.040 --> 00:13:42.000
 just about to the punch line and then walk out so everyone else in the lift is like oh what happens?

00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:47.040
 But he also stopped the lift just by jamming his arm into the doors and levering them open and

00:13:47.040 --> 00:13:55.440
 getting out even if it was between floors classic hit pranks. So I think the most impressive prank.

00:13:55.440 --> 00:14:01.280
 I don't know if this is impressive if it makes him a bad person but I know what I think already.

00:14:01.280 --> 00:14:09.760
 Yeah you're a bit of a prude. So he was one of his employees on set one night he said I bet you

00:14:09.760 --> 00:14:15.280
 a certain amount of money. I think it was just I bet you a pound that you won't agree to be handcuffed

00:14:15.280 --> 00:14:19.520
 to a part of this set overnight you don't have the balls I'm going to turn all the lights off.

00:14:19.520 --> 00:14:24.080
 And so the stage I was like oh a pound yeah maybe it was more than a pound it was still only the

00:14:24.080 --> 00:14:30.880
 60s. Yeah yeah I can do that sure. So Alfred was like yeah great fine have a drink to celebrate.

00:14:30.880 --> 00:14:36.560
 Gave him a brandy, spiked his brandy with a lot of laxatives, handcuffed him to the set,

00:14:36.560 --> 00:14:41.040
 they all went home, they came back the next day, there was a man there in tears,

00:14:41.040 --> 00:14:46.960
 covered in shit having soiled himself all over the set. Now do you think that makes him fun?

00:14:46.960 --> 00:14:54.080
 Well do you think it maybe makes him a bad person? Call me Captain Prude.

00:14:54.080 --> 00:15:03.360
 I'm on the fence. He did then give him a bonus. Oh great. Yeah but this this is a good sort of bar

00:15:03.360 --> 00:15:08.400
 of what his comedy was like. The BBC uncovered some archive interviews that they did with him

00:15:08.400 --> 00:15:15.200
 recently from a while ago when he was alive and he read all the interviews after he died us.

00:15:15.200 --> 00:15:23.440
 So it turns out that psycho the the great horror when he made it he thought he was making a really

00:15:23.440 --> 00:15:28.240
 good comedy. Absolutely true he thought he was making a comedy and he thought people he was

00:15:28.240 --> 00:15:34.160
 parodying the genre but he did it so well and he took it so into such an obscene territory that

00:15:34.160 --> 00:15:38.880
 he got taken as a property. He did it so well that it wasn't funny is that what a stand-up

00:15:38.880 --> 00:15:45.520
 comedian could say. Yeah so good no. No, according to Hitchcock that's what he said. Psycho was intended

00:15:45.520 --> 00:15:50.480
 to be a comedy. You know when he released when he first released Psycho he bought up or he got his

00:15:50.480 --> 00:15:55.440
 PA to buy up all the copies of the novel Psycho that he could find in America because he didn't

00:15:55.440 --> 00:15:59.200
 want anyone to give away the ending. Yeah he would do that with all of his films. He bought up the

00:15:59.200 --> 00:16:03.360
 right so you couldn't see them in the cinema after the cinema run had ended because he only wanted

00:16:03.360 --> 00:16:08.400
 people to see them in the cinema so he would stop them from being broadcast after that so for about

00:16:08.400 --> 00:16:13.840
 30 years nobody saw Psycho in the cinema after you know until after he died. Really? Psycho is the

00:16:13.840 --> 00:16:21.520
 first film to feature a actual shot of a toilet flushing. Oh yeah. 1960 was when it was made and

00:16:21.520 --> 00:16:25.840
 still before then so taboo and it got all these terrible reviews which were partly based on all

00:16:25.840 --> 00:16:29.840
 the murders and partly based on I can't believe they showed a toilet flushing this is outrageous.

00:16:30.400 --> 00:16:35.440
 They had never it had never been seen on screen before. I like the way you say so taboo it never happened

00:16:35.440 --> 00:16:40.240
 before as though obviously if they had been able so it had been socially appropriate to do a toilet flushing

00:16:40.240 --> 00:16:44.400
 they would have included it in all the films. There just aren't that many scenes in films with

00:16:44.400 --> 00:16:50.000
 that's an appropriate thing to show. Yeah you're right. You're right. He was something else fun. He

00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:54.400
 did if you went on holiday and you were friends with Alfred he would... He would murder you.

00:16:54.400 --> 00:17:03.440
 But there he is. And then you were bonus. If you went on holiday he was actually completely harmless.

00:17:03.440 --> 00:17:07.680
 He would just leave some extra large furniture in your house for when you returned. He sounds

00:17:07.680 --> 00:17:16.320
 so awful. I'm speaking of things that were only used once. Justin Bieber never wears underpants twice.

00:17:16.320 --> 00:17:21.360
 Does he know? I googled sort of famous people who may not use things twice and

00:17:22.240 --> 00:17:30.160
 Oh well you googled Justin Bieber no one the way. I discovered that the queen is not allowed to appear

00:17:30.160 --> 00:17:38.240
 in a public... I guess if she's going to open a library or like you know launch a new Starbucks latte

00:17:38.240 --> 00:17:44.160
 she can't appear anywhere. But she can't be seen in the same costume that she's worn previously.

00:17:44.160 --> 00:17:48.880
 Otherwise what happens? Well I think it's just they don't want it to happen and she has a

00:17:48.880 --> 00:17:54.720
 stylist who has a spreadsheet of every single bit of clothing that she's worn to an appearance and

00:17:54.720 --> 00:17:58.960
 she make they make sure that nothing matches up and they've given every bit of clothing a

00:17:58.960 --> 00:18:06.000
 quote name like buttercup for a yellow dress. But she's been going a long time like the queen so

00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:10.800
 there must be not many clothes left. She's going to be just turning up in a romper suit.

00:18:10.800 --> 00:18:17.520
 So the headline is always if Kate Middleton wears an outfit twice they say she's recycling her outfits.

00:18:17.520 --> 00:18:21.360
 Exactly. So you never see that with a queen because of the great spreadsheet that they've made.

00:18:21.360 --> 00:18:26.480
 And so this guy Stuart Parvin he's the guy who for 11 years was the queen's personal

00:18:26.480 --> 00:18:32.400
 he dressed her he picked all the clothing. He said in this interview that she has someone employed

00:18:32.400 --> 00:18:38.080
 specifically to wear her shoes before she wears them. No way. So someone just wears the queen's shoes

00:18:38.080 --> 00:18:42.160
 and breaks them in. Yeah so they're comfy. Yeah so they're comfy for when she has to wear them for

00:18:42.160 --> 00:18:45.840
 the first time that she goes to a... So the only person who can have that job is someone who has

00:18:45.840 --> 00:18:50.880
 exactly the same size and shape feet as the queen I guess. Yeah I read the other day I don't even know

00:18:50.880 --> 00:18:57.600
 if it's true. I read that Prince Charles has his shoe laces ironed every day. No no no no no no it

00:18:57.600 --> 00:19:01.680
 might not be true but I did read it. Only if you buy his curly shoe laces like fun ones where you

00:19:01.680 --> 00:19:08.160
 can get as a kid. I'm sure he does. That's slightly more expensive. Curly fries. So smashing things.

00:19:08.160 --> 00:19:12.240
 Should we go on to that? Smashing crockery. The Greeks do that don't they? Yeah. Well actually they

00:19:12.240 --> 00:19:17.200
 don't really do it. It's been this kind of discouraged increase these days. They prefer people not to do

00:19:17.200 --> 00:19:23.440
 it so much. Not just for the austerity reasons. No they don't really think it's a good idea. But when

00:19:23.440 --> 00:19:29.840
 they do do it the what they do often is I believe this is true. They'll buy lots of kind of semi-broken

00:19:29.840 --> 00:19:33.840
 plates like they've already got little cracks in them and they'll have like 19 of those and they're

00:19:33.840 --> 00:19:39.120
 one real plate and they'll kind of run the real plates along. They've slightly broken ones to make

00:19:39.120 --> 00:19:43.520
 it look this is real this is real and then they'll smash them all on the floor so often one of them won't

00:19:43.520 --> 00:19:47.200
 properly smash because that's the real plate and the other ones aren't really real. Hang on,

00:19:47.200 --> 00:19:52.880
 sorry. What cauliflower's a plate as real? As in it's got like cracks it's like like a stunts plate.

00:19:52.880 --> 00:20:01.360
 You can't still put food on it because you can't put food on it. It's stunt food. But apparently before

00:20:01.360 --> 00:20:05.840
 they smash plates they used to throw knives at the feet of dancers. I'm going to have to move us

00:20:05.840 --> 00:20:11.120
 on to the next fact. But if you have anything more go for it. Just one thing like it's quite famous

00:20:11.120 --> 00:20:18.000
 that Churring used to chain his teacup to a radiator. Alan Churring. Alan Churring, yeah so the great

00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:25.040
 the great computer scientist during in Blechley Park he used to chain his cop to a radiator so that

00:20:25.040 --> 00:20:29.440
 no one would steal it. Well not like not like to mess with his teacup or anything like Alfred Hitchcock

00:20:29.440 --> 00:20:35.040
 torturing his teacups. Okay cool. But everyone like thinks of this as a kind of a weird sort of way

00:20:35.040 --> 00:20:39.600
 that he's quite eccentric but a few years ago they went round to Blechley Park and they were

00:20:39.600 --> 00:20:46.080
 draining the lake to try and find some enigma machines and when they drained the lake they found

00:20:46.080 --> 00:20:52.240
 the load of cups in there and apparently Churring's assistant used to just go around with his cop

00:20:52.240 --> 00:20:56.720
 and they just wander around and throw it in the water. So actually he was quite right to chain it

00:20:56.720 --> 00:21:02.160
 too because people just used to steal it all the time. Yeah maybe that's why Hitchcock did it to prevent

00:21:02.160 --> 00:21:11.520
 theft. Okay time for fact number three and that is Andy. My fact is the Romanian equivalent of

00:21:11.520 --> 00:21:16.080
 comparing apples and oranges is you're comparing grandmothers and machine guns

00:21:16.080 --> 00:21:24.160
 because those are much more different than apples and oranges are. Yeah apples and oranges are

00:21:24.160 --> 00:21:29.360
 really similar and there have been studies done on apples and oranges. What did see how similar

00:21:29.360 --> 00:21:33.440
 they are? It turns out they're different. There was one study in the British Medical Journal in 2000

00:21:33.440 --> 00:21:37.360
 and it's kind of a joke study but still and he did this whole table of similarities and differences

00:21:37.360 --> 00:21:43.760
 between apples and oranges. So both round? Both round yes. Both fruit? Yeah I can keep going. No

00:21:43.760 --> 00:21:55.680
 no. So in the colour table it says oranges, orange, apples depends on variety. Can be juiced oranges?

00:21:55.680 --> 00:22:01.760
 Yes. Apples? Yes. He goes through this whole list of similarities between them. Yeah. And

00:22:01.760 --> 00:22:06.800
 they are already similar. It turns out. And so why is it grandmothers and grandmothers? I don't know.

00:22:06.800 --> 00:22:10.560
 It just I think they've picked two very very different things. Oh okay. Yeah. They've just done

00:22:10.560 --> 00:22:16.080
 better than we did. It's slightly more imaginative than we are. Another thing they say in Romania is

00:22:16.080 --> 00:22:22.640
 it's like comparing cows and long johns. My favourite one when I was trying to find sort of

00:22:22.640 --> 00:22:28.320
 interesting things. There's a Spanish proverb and this is the Spanish proverb. There are no ugly 15

00:22:28.320 --> 00:22:35.120
 year olds. I don't know what context you would ever say. Well in prison? I think. They say.

00:22:35.120 --> 00:22:41.600
 Well you're honor. I think the court and the jury will agree.

00:22:41.600 --> 00:22:47.360
 Wow. All children are attractive. Do you want to hear some more Romanian phrases and guess what

00:22:47.360 --> 00:22:55.200
 they mean? Oh yeah, sure. Please. You take me out of the watermelons. Is it like something you say

00:22:55.200 --> 00:22:59.760
 to a lady who really kind of blows your mind? Yeah. You give me butterflies. No, it's the opposite.

00:22:59.760 --> 00:23:05.280
 It's you're making me really angry. Because obviously where do we all want to be among the watermelons?

00:23:05.280 --> 00:23:10.480
 Yeah. You take me out of the watermelons. Stop this. That explains the problems I had in that

00:23:10.480 --> 00:23:21.200
 Romanian nightclub. My face has fallen off. Is it literal that one? No. No. I'm surprised. I'm surprised.

00:23:21.200 --> 00:23:28.240
 And you've put not in the beans. Is that something you might say to well for a pitchcock?

00:23:28.240 --> 00:23:32.560
 It just means you've made a mistake. It's just a fun way of saying you've made a mistake.

00:23:32.560 --> 00:23:36.400
 You put not in the beans. I have made a whip out of shit.

00:23:39.600 --> 00:23:43.600
 It means I've done a lot with a little. I've made a really good effort considering I've got limited

00:23:43.600 --> 00:23:48.640
 resources. I'm making a purse from a Salzea, I think. Yeah, I've made a purse from a Salzea and a

00:23:48.640 --> 00:23:55.120
 whip out of shit. A whip isn't a spaceship. I mean it's not the most complicated thing you can

00:23:55.120 --> 00:24:01.280
 manufacture. Okay, you try making a whip out of shit. I have a friend who lived in South America

00:24:01.280 --> 00:24:07.200
 who powered electrically his entire home out of a huge pile of manure in his back garden.

00:24:07.200 --> 00:24:14.080
 And you're saying making a whip squidging poo into something that could hit someone is like turning

00:24:14.080 --> 00:24:18.720
 something tiny into something fantastic. I just I would question the logic of that one.

00:24:18.720 --> 00:24:24.720
 All right. They aren't quite logical. In Germany they say you have tomatoes on your eyes

00:24:24.720 --> 00:24:31.280
 to mean you're not saying what everyone else can see but why tomatoes? It's always fruit and apples

00:24:31.280 --> 00:24:35.600
 especially. So in Spanish, I think they say when you say you're going to walk around the block

00:24:35.600 --> 00:24:41.760
 in Spain you'd say let's walk around the apple. Take a walk around the apple. Don't know why.

00:24:41.760 --> 00:24:47.680
 That's great. It's weird. In Colombia to confuse two things. It's a bit like what are you saying

00:24:47.680 --> 00:24:55.360
 before but you would say he confused shit with face cream. Oh, that is a mistake. It is a mistake,

00:24:55.360 --> 00:25:04.400
 yeah. Or one of Alfred Hitchcock's hilarious praise. And if you in Sweden, if you

00:25:04.400 --> 00:25:09.680
 if you're talking about someone who hasn't really had to put in much effort to achieve what they've

00:25:09.680 --> 00:25:16.560
 achieved, do you say he's slid in on a shrimp sandwich. And that means he got here really easily.

00:25:16.560 --> 00:25:20.880
 Which actually not that easy to slide on a shrimp sandwich. You have such what priorities about

00:25:20.880 --> 00:25:26.240
 what's easy and what's hard. It's easy to slip on a shrimp sandwich. It's very hard to compress

00:25:26.240 --> 00:25:30.880
 turds together to make him a working whip. Indiana Jones's whip wasn't made of poo.

00:25:32.960 --> 00:25:36.800
 We don't know that. I think we think we have very different skill sets. What is slipping

00:25:36.800 --> 00:25:41.200
 is very different to sliding. So you can slip on it but sliding in that implies that you're

00:25:41.200 --> 00:25:45.920
 skiing into the into the piece. And we'll can see the skiing on a shrimp sandwich will be hard.

00:25:45.920 --> 00:25:51.520
 They don't want to be quite difficult. Are any of these are any of these actually said in these

00:25:51.520 --> 00:25:56.560
 countries? It's a weird one that because we occasionally do this kind of thing on QI and when we

00:25:56.560 --> 00:26:03.920
 ever say it we'll say okay in Thailand they say the hens is a snake's feet and the snake sees the

00:26:03.920 --> 00:26:08.960
 hens boobs and that means two people who know each other's secret. We'll say something like that on QI

00:26:08.960 --> 00:26:14.240
 and then everyone in Thailand will email us and say no we don't say that at all. I think it will be

00:26:14.240 --> 00:26:18.480
 said and I think it's just people like I haven't heard every phrase that gets used in Britain.

00:26:18.480 --> 00:26:24.640
 I think that's right. If there are people from Sweden or Spain or Germany who know that we're

00:26:24.640 --> 00:26:29.920
 wrong please do heckle. So just like we were talking about grandmothers and machine guns right at the

00:26:29.920 --> 00:26:36.160
 start so maybe a few things about guns. Yeah. Yeah. You know how old you have to be to get a firearms

00:26:36.160 --> 00:26:43.120
 license in the UK? Is it 12? It's 14. Okay. Do you know how old you have to be to get a shotgun

00:26:43.120 --> 00:26:50.400
 license? No. You have to be two. No way. And the reason you have to be two is because an adult needs

00:26:50.400 --> 00:26:59.760
 to sign for you saying they've known you for at least two years. And I can confirm here's a fit

00:26:59.760 --> 00:27:07.680
 and proper person. There's loads of people like under 10 in the UK who have shotgun licenses but you

00:27:07.680 --> 00:27:12.080
 can't buy a shotgun until you're certain age although an adult could buy you a shotgun. Does anyone

00:27:12.080 --> 00:27:19.520
 have a shotgun license? Well just that child on the front ground. How old are you? 19. So you've had it

00:27:19.520 --> 00:27:25.520
 for 17 years. You must be very good. The person who invented the first portable automatic machine

00:27:25.520 --> 00:27:31.840
 gun was guy called Hiram Maxim. He's kind of a bit famous and he was arrested an old age. He also

00:27:31.840 --> 00:27:38.400
 invented the traditional mouse trap that people use. He was arrested an old age in 1913 for harassing

00:27:38.400 --> 00:27:46.160
 salvation army workers with a pea shooter. But better that than the machine gun. I read a story

00:27:46.160 --> 00:27:51.120
 about him which was that when he invented the machine gun but was testing it out in his neighborhood.

00:27:51.120 --> 00:27:56.720
 He went to all his neighbors saying sorry to bother at 3 p.m. today or whatever time he said

00:27:56.720 --> 00:28:02.240
 I'm going to be testing out my new machine gun. If you could open your windows the noise is so great

00:28:02.240 --> 00:28:06.400
 in this vicinity all smash all the glass in your house if the windows are shut could you really

00:28:06.400 --> 00:28:10.080
 consider it? Yeah he sounds like a nice guy. I think he showed off the gun there was an early

00:28:10.080 --> 00:28:14.480
 demonstration of the machine gun and he was because it was Queen Victoria who was the queen at the time

00:28:14.480 --> 00:28:18.240
 and one of the things he did to demonstrate how cool it was was he blasted with the machine gun the

00:28:18.240 --> 00:28:26.880
 letters V R for Victoria Regina into a brick wall. Yeah that was the thing. When you would you trust

00:28:26.880 --> 00:28:31.680
 a man who said I'm going to be practicing with my machine gun this morning can I ask that you open

00:28:31.680 --> 00:28:41.040
 your windows for me. I mean it doesn't really make any difference whether you do or not. We're

00:28:41.040 --> 00:28:46.880
 going to have to move on. So time for our final fact and that is James Harkin. Okay my fact this

00:28:46.880 --> 00:28:56.560
 week is that replacement eyelets can be made from foreskins. I told you I told you they would

00:28:56.560 --> 00:29:02.240
 have grown. Has this actually been done? It's been done yeah it has been done. You might lose your

00:29:02.240 --> 00:29:06.640
 eyelid for you might get a disease or you might it might be burned. Someone might be practicing

00:29:06.640 --> 00:29:12.480
 with a machine gun next door. Exactly and then the problem is your eyelid is kind of really thin

00:29:12.480 --> 00:29:16.720
 kind of skin and so it's really hard to find replacement skin from around the body and there are

00:29:16.720 --> 00:29:21.680
 a few different places to get it but the foreskin works particularly well and people have had

00:29:21.680 --> 00:29:30.560
 their eyelets replaced with foreskins. Do they what what do they get to replace their foreskin

00:29:30.560 --> 00:29:36.240
 so they get another foreskin from somewhere else? No, it's like a pyramid scheme of foreskins.

00:29:36.240 --> 00:29:43.040
 They do that. If your foreskin is on your eyelid are you circumcised or is that does a

00:29:43.040 --> 00:29:47.200
 foreskin have to be fully removed or does it just have to remove them it's original position?

00:29:47.200 --> 00:29:53.840
 That's a very good question. James I feel like I'm going to let you down. I don't know the correct

00:29:53.840 --> 00:29:58.480
 answer. You should really read the Torah because it must be in there somewhere. Just quickly before

00:29:58.480 --> 00:30:03.440
 we get into foreskin valley. If you don't have a this is really really cool. If you don't have

00:30:03.440 --> 00:30:08.880
 if your eyelids don't work so the eyelid is there and it's intact but it need it doesn't operate

00:30:08.880 --> 00:30:14.480
 the muscles don't work to move it. One way that doctors can fix it is they take gold thread

00:30:14.480 --> 00:30:18.400
 and because they use gold in the body because it doesn't react with anything it's inert chemically

00:30:18.400 --> 00:30:23.760
 and it's the thread they use is a hundred times thinner than a human hair and they thread it

00:30:23.760 --> 00:30:27.680
 through the eyelid which gives it a bit of stability and it stiffens it and what that means is

00:30:27.680 --> 00:30:32.000
 it's stiff enough to open and close the eye but you have to do it by hand so you just do this.

00:30:32.000 --> 00:30:36.880
 You just really have nothing to go. Yeah I'm awake or whatever it is that you do. Isn't that

00:30:36.880 --> 00:30:46.000
 incredible? Yeah so you can wink at someone by just going. I read this thing this isn't really

00:30:46.000 --> 00:30:51.920
 related but one of the early butter augmentation surgeries the guy who invented butter called

00:30:51.920 --> 00:30:58.160
 mentation basically took a breast kind of silicon thing from a breast and just put it in someone's

00:30:58.160 --> 00:31:03.280
 but that's basically the way he did it but the problem was it didn't really look like a

00:31:03.280 --> 00:31:10.160
 bottom so it didn't really work. Is that what it did? And so what they did instead is they managed to get

00:31:10.160 --> 00:31:14.960
 like something that was better sculpted and put it in between the gluteus maximus and I think the

00:31:14.960 --> 00:31:20.080
 gluteus minimus and so it actually looked a bit like a butterk and this was the first proper real

00:31:20.080 --> 00:31:27.040
 butter called mentation surgery but the problem was that it kept slipping and so what you could do is

00:31:27.040 --> 00:31:31.360
 someone would go oh your butterk slipped and then you could actually lift it up and put it back

00:31:31.360 --> 00:31:35.840
 in place. How far down did it slip? Could go as far as out of your trousers or something.

00:31:35.840 --> 00:31:41.440
 Oh sorry. It could go quite far down the thigh I think. Oh my god.

00:31:41.440 --> 00:31:46.000
 Interesting that isn't it? Yeah that's amazing. I wonder if you still say someone had a nice

00:31:46.000 --> 00:31:52.240
 arse if it was just halfway down the cob. I read about the first penis transplant the other day

00:31:52.240 --> 00:31:57.040
 which they've successfully done. Yeah and they knew they could do it for a long time and this guy

00:31:57.040 --> 00:32:01.920
 wanted to have it done and the only issue was is that for four to five years it was I guess to the

00:32:01.920 --> 00:32:12.960
 tail end of four years they couldn't find a donor. That's very reasonable. I heard that they used

00:32:12.960 --> 00:32:18.240
 a middle finger once for a penis transplant. No I've read this and they're all looking and I've got no

00:32:18.240 --> 00:32:22.480
 evidence either. I've forgotten all the sources and I read it five or six years ago anyway. It's

00:32:22.480 --> 00:32:28.000
 already quite bad when someone gives you the finger in the street. It was also attached to the groin

00:32:28.000 --> 00:32:35.840
 it would be ten times worse. Let's say some stuff on eyelids specifically. Pioneering French surgeon

00:32:35.840 --> 00:32:43.200
 Ambrose Paray. If you had etching eyelids he suggested washing your eyelids in urine

00:32:43.200 --> 00:32:51.600
 but only if the urine had been kept all night in a barber's basin. Okay it's very specific isn't it?

00:32:51.600 --> 00:32:56.320
 What does do you have to have the consent of the barber presumably? You can't just wean a barber's

00:32:56.320 --> 00:32:59.840
 basin. Yeah they go in the next day. Oh yeah sir I've been using basin four. I hope you don't mind

00:32:59.840 --> 00:33:04.080
 my eyelids are itchy. Do you want to hear another really interesting body part replacement thing?

00:33:04.080 --> 00:33:08.560
 Yes please. This guy is great. Okay there's a Finnish computer programmer. His name is Jerry

00:33:08.560 --> 00:33:15.920
 Gelava and in 2008 he lost a finger. He lost his third finger in a motorbike accident so he replaced

00:33:15.920 --> 00:33:25.200
 it with his penis. Yeah his typing has not improved. Everyone was saying oh it's so annoying for you

00:33:25.200 --> 00:33:28.640
 because you type for a living don't you because you're a computer programmer you're going to be really

00:33:28.640 --> 00:33:32.080
 it's going to be really annoying for you and he said yes yes it is going to be really annoying and

00:33:32.080 --> 00:33:37.200
 eventually he decided to do something about it and he built himself a prosthetic finger not only that

00:33:37.200 --> 00:33:44.000
 it doubles up as a USB drive. So all he has to do he just peels back his prosthetic fingernail and

00:33:44.000 --> 00:33:48.720
 there's a there's a he can just plug into a computer. No no no no one can ever just plug in a USB

00:33:48.720 --> 00:33:55.040
 into a computer. I'm sorry upside down and then yeah yeah and so he he can store two gigabytes of

00:33:55.040 --> 00:33:59.120
 data in his finger and he can even remove the whole finger and give it to someone else if they

00:33:59.120 --> 00:34:03.760
 need to store a file or something. How cool is that? Amazing yeah what a great guy. I don't know if

00:34:03.760 --> 00:34:11.760
 I'd accept that. If you ask someone they have a spare USB. Oh yeah. It's a great idea. Another

00:34:11.760 --> 00:34:17.840
 on eyes and yeah like replacement surgery you know if so in 2009 I think was the first instance of

00:34:17.840 --> 00:34:25.680
 this woman who'd been blind for nine years had her eye replaced with her tooth and she could see again

00:34:25.680 --> 00:34:30.800
 and so this sometimes people are having surgery to get their cornea replaced with their tooth

00:34:30.800 --> 00:34:36.480
 and they make so they drill a hole in the tooth and they make a little lens in it and then they

00:34:36.480 --> 00:34:40.800
 have to implant it in a different part of your body because the lens needs to properly fuse I think

00:34:40.800 --> 00:34:46.640
 with the tooth first of all so they implanted it in her shoulder for a while. This is her tooth

00:34:46.640 --> 00:34:51.840
 and then they can put it in the eye if you google images very weird but there are people who've had

00:34:51.840 --> 00:34:56.080
 their teeth in their eyes and they can see properly and they just line it up with the retina

00:34:56.080 --> 00:35:00.240
 and it's people who've got corneal problems where it's gone blurry so. That's amazing. It's great.

00:35:00.240 --> 00:35:04.080
 You can pat someone on the shoulder and on the eye and on the tooth at the same time.

00:35:04.080 --> 00:35:09.600
 That is so incredible. That's the main benefit that's what they say they're all pleased about.

00:35:09.600 --> 00:35:12.640
 We're going to have to wrap up soon so should we? James?

00:35:12.640 --> 00:35:19.840
 Okay well just on what you were saying you can get stem cells these days can do all sorts of things

00:35:19.840 --> 00:35:24.880
 and people there was a lady who kind of ingested some stem cells into her wrinkles around her eyes

00:35:24.880 --> 00:35:28.240
 because she wanted to get rid of the wrinkles and it was hope that it would grow back

00:35:28.240 --> 00:35:32.400
 and then suddenly whenever she kind of winked her eyes she heard this bony clicking

00:35:33.360 --> 00:35:44.960
 and it turned out that a bone had grown in her eyelid. I know. I've got some light

00:35:44.960 --> 00:35:50.880
 entertains up about four skin depending on what's it? Oh hang on, all night is that eyelid

00:35:50.880 --> 00:35:53.440
 quickly because I've always wanted to know this. You know is that thing when you're eyelid in

00:35:53.440 --> 00:36:00.720
 voluntarily twitches? Like you have a twitching eyelid so that's called blepharous plasm or blepharous

00:36:00.720 --> 00:36:06.000
 plasm and so it's usually it's usually fine and harmless some people have it so badly that

00:36:06.000 --> 00:36:12.480
 eyelids get locked shut and a cure that was proposed for that in the late 1700s was by a doctor

00:36:12.480 --> 00:36:17.920
 Gerald and he suggested that. He doesn't sound like a real doctor. If any doctor only gives you

00:36:17.920 --> 00:36:24.720
 their first name that's a real danger sign like Dr Nick in The Simpsons. So Dr. Jess advised that

00:36:24.720 --> 00:36:28.160
 people who had this problem with their eyes were clamped shut because their blepharous plasm was

00:36:28.160 --> 00:36:34.320
 so bad. Don't try and cure the spasm drill a hole in their eyelid so that they can see through it.

00:36:34.320 --> 00:36:40.400
 I actually don't know if anyone had that done but it's lateral thinking.

00:36:40.400 --> 00:36:45.600
 Oh hope not. Also blepharous plasm are playing on the obelisk stage at 9pm tonight.

00:36:45.600 --> 00:36:50.400
 Secret gigs are checking them out. They're very good. Four skins, humorous four skins? Oh no.

00:36:50.400 --> 00:36:58.800
 All right there's a bit bit PG-13 but some cosmetics are tested on four skins but ones that have

00:36:58.800 --> 00:37:02.640
 been removed. If someone is circumcised when they're born the hospital normally sells the four

00:37:02.640 --> 00:37:08.160
 skin. There is a man out there who's been circumcised and his cells have been used and grown and grown

00:37:08.160 --> 00:37:13.520
 and grown and grown and grown to make an entire face cream company. But here's the thing it um there

00:37:13.520 --> 00:37:17.920
 was a whole anti because when people found out that four skins were being used for cosmetics

00:37:17.920 --> 00:37:23.920
 there was a huge um anti-four skin movement that tried to stop it and it turns out Oprah Winfrey has

00:37:23.920 --> 00:37:30.400
 released four skin products um not for your four skin for like four skin face products and they said

00:37:30.400 --> 00:37:38.000
 product name four skin. That's brilliant. Yes. So obvious. Yeah but so that's the amazing thing about

00:37:38.000 --> 00:37:43.440
 it. It's not as if they're carting off lots of four skins to turn into face cream. It's one

00:37:43.440 --> 00:37:47.920
 singular four skin that they've been using for 20 years. Well they come that there are lots of four

00:37:47.920 --> 00:37:52.480
 skins but yeah you can use them for up to yeah I think 40 years. Because it's just the cells in

00:37:52.480 --> 00:37:56.400
 that are very unusual and there's uh did you say that they're like stem cells and they can be grown

00:37:56.400 --> 00:38:00.880
 and used in lots of different ways and they're yeah they're incredible medically yeah that's insane.

00:38:00.880 --> 00:38:05.040
 Um we're gonna have to wrap up in a sec so if anyone's got anything a final fact they want to

00:38:05.040 --> 00:38:10.560
 throw in? No. No we're good. Uh okay all right that's it that's all of our facts thanks so much for
