00:00:00,00:00:25,"And welcome to another episode, a no such thing as a fish, this week coming to you from"
00:00:25,00:00:30,the literary arena in the Latitude Festival. My name is Dan Schreiber. I'm sitting here
00:00:30,00:00:35,"with three other QILs. It's Aniches Insky, Andy Murray, and James Harkin. And once again,"
00:00:35,00:00:38,we've gathered around the microphones with our four favorite facts from the last seven
00:00:38,00:00:44,"days. And in a particular order, here we go. And we're going to start with my fact this week."
00:00:44,00:00:50,My fact this week is that the world record for horse long jump is shorter than the world record
00:00:50,00:00:57,for human long jump. That just can't even be true. That just is so obviously not true at some
00:00:57,00:01:02,"believer. No, it's absolutely true. But here's the weird thing. Horse long jump. Did anyone know"
00:01:02,00:01:08,that existed? It was an Olympic sport for one year. I have a question about the horse long jump.
00:01:08,00:01:12,Did they have to do it with a human on their back? Yes. Well then of course they're going to
00:01:12,00:01:18,let if you put a if you put a horse on a human's back. That's not a fair comparison though. You
00:01:18,00:01:23,"need to put so it'd be like strapping a child to your back maybe. Okay. Which wouldn't be allowed,"
00:01:23,00:01:28,"I guess. No. But listen horses. Okay, how many how many people here just by show a hand, a surprise"
00:01:28,00:01:33,"that humans can jump further than horses? Yeah, pretty much everyone. Yeah. And when you say"
00:01:33,00:01:40,"surprised, none of them believe you. Okay, so this is absolutely true. You can go online to Wikipedia."
00:01:43,00:01:50,"So this was in the 1900s. Your niche sources for these. So 1900 at the Olympics, they did the horse"
00:01:50,00:01:58,drum. The guy riding the horse was called constant van Langhendonk and his horse was called
00:01:58,00:02:05,extra dry and he jumped as far as he jumped about six meters and that's not actually the horse record.
00:02:05,00:02:09,So that was just their first ever attempt at the Olympics. Everyone said let's not do that again.
00:02:09,00:02:14,Let's move on. Let's never speak about this. So the world record as it stands was set in 1975 by
00:02:14,00:02:20,horse. The horse was called something. What was it called? Something. The horse was actually called
00:02:20,00:02:27,something. That was the actual name of the horse by Mr Andre Ferreira and they jumped 8.4 meters.
00:02:27,00:02:34,So that's the horse record. The human record is 8.95 meters. Yeah. And that was set in 1991 by
00:02:34,00:02:39,guy called Mike Powell. It's still holding to this day as the longest human jump. What about height?
00:02:39,00:02:43,Can they jump? Can we jump higher than horses or can they jump higher than us? I think the horses
00:02:43,00:02:50,"can go higher. Can they? Yeah. Well, I've looked it up. Oh, really? And there is an official high jump"
00:02:50,00:02:57,record for horses and it's two meters 47 and the official high jump record for humans is two meters
00:02:57,00:03:04,45. So they can beat us by two centimeters. Wow. But do they know that we're asking them to jump
00:03:04,00:03:09,really high? There's the problem. There's a big fence in the way that gives a bit of a clue.
00:03:09,00:03:16,"Yeah. They just don't have the like competitive urge, you know, they don't know that they need to win."
00:03:16,00:03:19,That's true. That's the thing that we do. But the thing is with human high jump is there was a
00:03:19,00:03:23,"massive difference was that when Dick Fosbury came in and did his Fosbury flop, which is going over"
00:03:23,00:03:29,backwards. And until then the record was a certain amount and then it went massively up in a really
00:03:29,00:03:35,"short amount of time. And what's interesting with him is he was the in the America, he went gold in"
00:03:35,00:03:42,the Olympics in 1968. But by 1970 he wasn't even in the Olympic team anymore because everyone else
00:03:42,00:03:45,"had seen his tactic and gone, that's amazing. And he wasn't even that good at high jumper."
00:03:45,00:03:49,"Really? It's just the technique. Yeah, just the technique. That's the only thing that did it. He"
00:03:49,00:03:55,wasn't even that good. So long jump was almost the opposite right because the long jump record until
00:03:55,00:04:00,it was broken by Mike Powell in 1991 was held for I think a record length of time in the Olympics. So
00:04:00,00:04:07,it was broken in 1968 by Robert Beaumont. And he just did this incredible long jump. So the record
00:04:07,00:04:14,up until then had been 21 feet and three quarters of an inch. And then in 1968 he jumped 29 feet
00:04:14,00:04:19,and 2.5 inches. And he jumped so far that they couldn't record it properly because they didn't have
00:04:19,00:04:22,the equipment to stretch that far. They didn't have the equipment to stretch them. Yeah. How I
00:04:22,00:04:26,didn't know how advanced the equipment has to be. In order for you to buy another one meter ruler
00:04:26,00:04:32,to measure the amount of people. So I think he jumped 29 feet. I think this with long jumps is
00:04:32,00:04:36,they record. Some people record. I don't know if it's true. Some people record you could go further
00:04:36,00:04:40,if you do a sum of salt while you're jumping. That makes sense. But there's a rule that says you're
00:04:40,00:04:45,not allowed. The rule is very clear. It says the jumper's head has to stay in a superior position
00:04:45,00:04:50,during the jump. So your head has to be always the highest point. But why has someone done it and
00:04:50,00:04:55,they've gone further? Well they said that it was maybe due to it being dangerous. But the actual
00:04:55,00:05:00,reason that they said they jumped band it when they did is that nobody would jump a puddle in this way.
00:05:00,00:05:05,So apparently that's what we're doing with a long jump. It's just a way of jumping a puddle.
00:05:05,00:05:10,Good Olympic reasoning. Do you want to hear something else that happened at the 1900 Olympics?
00:05:10,00:05:17,"Yes, please. Men's underwater swimming. So start underwater and you just keep going"
00:05:17,00:05:20,until you have to come up and you get a point for every second you're underwater and you get a point
00:05:20,00:05:25,"for every meter you swim underwater. It was never held again because of, and I quote,"
00:05:25,00:05:32,a lack of spectator appeal. Actually they're kind of bringing that back you know because they found
00:05:32,00:05:37,"that swimming underwater is quicker than swimming freestyle. Yeah, it's called the fish kick."
00:05:37,00:05:42,"Yeah, yeah, yeah. And it's the first time they found a new swimming stroke which is faster than"
00:05:42,00:05:47,"freestyle. The first time it's happened in hundreds of years. Yeah, it's really cool. It's literally"
00:05:47,00:05:51,"moving your hips really, really far and you know moving your arms around. You look like a fish when"
00:05:51,00:05:58,"you're doing it. Yeah, yeah. There's another so horse long jump has been abandoned as an Olympic sport."
00:05:58,00:06:04,There's a list of other Olympic sports that we no longer do. This is my favourite one. Solo
00:06:04,00:06:11,"synchronized swimming. And that was for three Olympics. Just one person in a pool with music,"
00:06:11,00:06:18,love it. And eventually they thought it's just not working for us. That's amazing. That's so cool.
00:06:18,00:06:24,Another thing they had at the 1900 Olympics was so they were really into horse events at that
00:06:24,00:06:30,Olympics I think and they had the male coach event which was basically who can deliver post
00:06:30,00:06:36,the fastest and was so there's the four in hand male coach event and it was four horses on a male
00:06:36,00:06:42,coach and you know you've got your letters and it was a race and the guy who won it actually was
00:06:42,00:06:47,the guy who then went on to found the Orion Express company weirdly so he was the guy behind
00:06:47,00:06:52,Orion Express train. You'll have seen some of my work in the Olympics. That's very cool. Have you
00:06:52,00:06:56,"heard of Margaret Abbott? No. She was an art student from America, right? She won in the 1900"
00:06:56,00:07:01,Olympics. She won a nine-hole golf tournament but she didn't know it was an Olympic event.
00:07:01,00:07:09,She died 55 years later still not knowing that she was America's first female Olympic champion.
00:07:09,00:07:16,I know. No one told her at any point. How did she get into the Olympics then? I don't know.
00:07:16,00:07:19,They're all these sort of weird half Olympic events. So the male coach I think they've decided
00:07:19,00:07:24,now it wasn't a technically Olympic event and all of this stuff. There's all this sort of shadow
00:07:24,00:07:27,Olympics. And the whole time I jump I think that same event was decided it didn't count as an
00:07:27,00:07:32,"Olympic event but the horse long jump did. Because horses jumped, I think they jumped just over six"
00:07:32,00:07:37,"foot at that. Oh, it's a thing. Which yeah. So the modern Olympics, you know it disappeared for"
00:07:37,00:07:40,"a long time. Obviously someone brought it back and the person who brought it back, one of the main"
00:07:40,00:07:47,people was a guy called Baron D. Kubaton. So Baron D. Kubaton decided when he set it up that he
00:07:47,00:07:53,"was going to award an Olympic gold. So someone won this in the Olympics for literature, right?"
00:07:53,00:07:58,"So there was a whole arts category that happened with the Olympics, which they've since dropped."
00:07:58,00:08:04,"But so they did it in all different things. They did it in sculpture, architecture, in poetry."
00:08:04,00:08:09,But do you know who won the poetry award? No. He did. Did he? Did he?
00:08:09,00:08:15,"He was no good at sports but he set up the Olympics and he's like, well, how am I going to win a gold"
00:08:15,00:08:20,medal then? And so he sets up poetry and then he did a poem himself and he won. He won a gold medal.
00:08:20,00:08:24,"Guys, I really, really think we should have a poetry competition in the Olympics. I know it's"
00:08:24,00:08:30,"kind of sporty but, you know, it was meant to be the whole thing. 1948 was the last London Olympics"
00:08:30,00:08:36,before 2012. That was the last time they had architecture and was it sculpting? Town planning.
00:08:36,00:08:43,Town planning. I've got the town planning. There was a little Olympic medal for town planning.
00:08:43,00:08:45,"Yeah, but it was solo town planning. That was very important."
00:08:47,00:08:54,So they also had it for painting and graphic art. So I've got the gold silver and bronze winners
00:08:54,00:09:02,of the 1948 painting and graphic art competition. So in it bronze was a guy called Alex Diglman
00:09:02,00:09:08,from Switzerland who won it for his graphic art world championship for ice hockey poster.
00:09:08,00:09:16,Silver was Alex Diglman from Switzerland for world championship for cycling poster. Gold medal
00:09:17,00:09:28,to no one. That is brutal. Can you imagine losing to nobody?
00:09:28,00:09:34,So the Olympic art had to be art that was about Olympic sports presumably.
00:09:34,00:09:37,Everything had to be about the Olympics. Imagine having to tell him that he won silver
00:09:37,00:09:41,and he'd be really excited and he'd say oh that's great. I'm so made up to one silver.
00:09:41,00:09:48,"Who got gold? Yeah, little thing Alex. There is an interesting thing. They did a study of faces"
00:09:48,00:09:54,of people who are doing races who do running races in the Olympics and they could tell how happy
00:09:54,00:10:00,people were by how smiley they were on the podium and anyone who came second was much more miserable
00:10:00,00:10:04,than whoever came third. They found that out because the people who came second presumably are
00:10:04,00:10:08,really upset because they just just missed out on gold and the people who came thirded well
00:10:08,00:10:14,I got something at least. James told us this great thing the other day
00:10:14,00:10:19,about you saying bolts. What was that quiz question that you said about him breaking the 100 meters?
00:10:19,00:10:25,Oh yeah. Well his fastest ever 100 meters is a lot faster than World Record and that's because
00:10:25,00:10:30,the second half of his 200 meters he'd already had a running start and so I think he beat
00:10:30,00:10:35,9 seconds for 100 meters. But he was already running. He was already starting. He had a really
00:10:35,00:10:40,start. Yeah. But when he broke their 100 meters World Record he had one of his shoes untied.
00:10:40,00:10:44,One of his shoelaces untied. No way. That's how good he is. Yeah. That would be so distracting.
00:10:44,00:10:48,How did he not stop? I'm sure he wasn't looking at it the whole time.
00:10:48,00:10:54,Should I deal with this? Did he stop and tie it up? Yeah he still broke the record in spite of
00:10:54,00:10:57,stopping to tie it up halfway through. That would not be double knot or. Yeah.
00:10:57,00:11:02,When he does 100 meters his feet are touching the ground for I think two seconds
00:11:03,00:11:11,and in the whole race. Wow. Wow. Do you want to know something else about the long jump in ancient
00:11:11,00:11:15,Greece? It was so hard that you were allowed to have weights so you held these weights and you sort
00:11:15,00:11:20,of threw them behind yourself as you jump forward. Also the ancient Greek long jump was so tricky
00:11:20,00:11:25,that you were allowed to have a flute playing so you could keep time with it as you did your jump.
00:11:25,00:11:29,That was that concession. We know this is really hard so we'll give you a flute player
00:11:29,00:11:34,to make it a bit easier. What's so the flute played a rhythm? Yeah yeah the flute would play
00:11:34,00:11:38,in time so that you could make your jump. I do feel like between flute playing and steroids
00:11:38,00:11:43,you'd probably go over the last of it. We understand this is hard. You can have an orchestra
00:11:43,00:11:48,accompanying you. Awesome performance. You're going to be tested for flutes obviously for liars
00:11:48,00:11:52,all kinds of stuff. We're going to have to move on to our second fact. Does anyone have anything
00:11:52,00:11:59,else before we do? No. Okay. Time for our second fact and that is Chisinski. Yeah my
00:11:59,00:12:04,fact is that every time Alfred Hitchcock had a cup of tea he always smashed the tea cup.
00:12:04,00:12:10,That was what he did. Always. Well apparently every morning he'd have his cup of tea before he
00:12:10,00:12:16,"went off to work and he'd drink the tea, smash the tea cup, go to work, he'd drink tea in the studio"
00:12:16,00:12:22,through tea cups at the wall and it was just his tea drinking habit. He sounds very difficult
00:12:22,00:12:28,doesn't he? He's a madman. He was a madman. Someone wrote a biography recently about him saying he was
00:12:28,00:12:32,doing it to remind himself of the frailty of human life. So he throws a tea cup against the wall
00:12:32,00:12:39,and thinks that's like me dying. But he just did it. He used the punch light bulbs out quite a long
00:12:39,00:12:45,set as well. That's how we turned off lights. He turned the light on and then he just punch it
00:12:45,00:12:51,until it stopped giving out light. And actually speaking of horses he was really good friends with
00:12:51,00:12:59,Gerald DeMaurier who was definitely DeMaurier's dad and Gerald DeMaurier was an actor and at one point
00:12:59,00:13:04,Alfred Hitchcock while Gerald DeMaurier was out on stage performing a play Alfred Hitchcock somehow
00:13:04,00:13:11,nobody knows how had a horse delivered to his dressing room so Gerald came back at the interval
00:13:11,00:13:16,or whatever while he was performing went into his dressing room and there was a huge horse there
00:13:16,00:13:20,and he didn't know what to do with it and no one knows how I got there and I don't know how he
00:13:20,00:13:26,removed it. He was a bit of a prankster wasn't he? He loved practical jokes. One of the things he used
00:13:26,00:13:31,to do was he would get into a lift with a friend of his who told amazing stories and then he would
00:13:31,00:13:37,"start to tell this incredible, incredible story and then as soon as the doors opened he would get"
00:13:37,00:13:42,just about to the punch line and then walk out so everyone else in the lift is like oh what happens?
00:13:42,00:13:47,But he also stopped the lift just by jamming his arm into the doors and levering them open and
00:13:47,00:13:55,getting out even if it was between floors classic hit pranks. So I think the most impressive prank.
00:13:55,00:14:01,I don't know if this is impressive if it makes him a bad person but I know what I think already.
00:14:01,00:14:09,Yeah you're a bit of a prude. So he was one of his employees on set one night he said I bet you
00:14:09,00:14:15,a certain amount of money. I think it was just I bet you a pound that you won't agree to be handcuffed
00:14:15,00:14:19,to a part of this set overnight you don't have the balls I'm going to turn all the lights off.
00:14:19,00:14:24,And so the stage I was like oh a pound yeah maybe it was more than a pound it was still only the
00:14:24,00:14:30,60s. Yeah yeah I can do that sure. So Alfred was like yeah great fine have a drink to celebrate.
00:14:30,00:14:36,"Gave him a brandy, spiked his brandy with a lot of laxatives, handcuffed him to the set,"
00:14:36,00:14:41,"they all went home, they came back the next day, there was a man there in tears,"
00:14:41,00:14:46,covered in shit having soiled himself all over the set. Now do you think that makes him fun?
00:14:46,00:14:54,Well do you think it maybe makes him a bad person? Call me Captain Prude.
00:14:54,00:15:03,I'm on the fence. He did then give him a bonus. Oh great. Yeah but this this is a good sort of bar
00:15:03,00:15:08,of what his comedy was like. The BBC uncovered some archive interviews that they did with him
00:15:08,00:15:15,recently from a while ago when he was alive and he read all the interviews after he died us.
00:15:15,00:15:23,So it turns out that psycho the the great horror when he made it he thought he was making a really
00:15:23,00:15:28,good comedy. Absolutely true he thought he was making a comedy and he thought people he was
00:15:28,00:15:34,parodying the genre but he did it so well and he took it so into such an obscene territory that
00:15:34,00:15:38,he got taken as a property. He did it so well that it wasn't funny is that what a stand-up
00:15:38,00:15:45,"comedian could say. Yeah so good no. No, according to Hitchcock that's what he said. Psycho was intended"
00:15:45,00:15:50,to be a comedy. You know when he released when he first released Psycho he bought up or he got his
00:15:50,00:15:55,PA to buy up all the copies of the novel Psycho that he could find in America because he didn't
00:15:55,00:15:59,want anyone to give away the ending. Yeah he would do that with all of his films. He bought up the
00:15:59,00:16:03,right so you couldn't see them in the cinema after the cinema run had ended because he only wanted
00:16:03,00:16:08,people to see them in the cinema so he would stop them from being broadcast after that so for about
00:16:08,00:16:13,30 years nobody saw Psycho in the cinema after you know until after he died. Really? Psycho is the
00:16:13,00:16:21,first film to feature a actual shot of a toilet flushing. Oh yeah. 1960 was when it was made and
00:16:21,00:16:25,still before then so taboo and it got all these terrible reviews which were partly based on all
00:16:25,00:16:29,the murders and partly based on I can't believe they showed a toilet flushing this is outrageous.
00:16:30,00:16:35,They had never it had never been seen on screen before. I like the way you say so taboo it never happened
00:16:35,00:16:40,before as though obviously if they had been able so it had been socially appropriate to do a toilet flushing
00:16:40,00:16:44,they would have included it in all the films. There just aren't that many scenes in films with
00:16:44,00:16:50,that's an appropriate thing to show. Yeah you're right. You're right. He was something else fun. He
00:16:50,00:16:54,did if you went on holiday and you were friends with Alfred he would... He would murder you.
00:16:54,00:17:03,But there he is. And then you were bonus. If you went on holiday he was actually completely harmless.
00:17:03,00:17:07,He would just leave some extra large furniture in your house for when you returned. He sounds
00:17:07,00:17:16,so awful. I'm speaking of things that were only used once. Justin Bieber never wears underpants twice.
00:17:16,00:17:21,Does he know? I googled sort of famous people who may not use things twice and
00:17:22,00:17:30,Oh well you googled Justin Bieber no one the way. I discovered that the queen is not allowed to appear
00:17:30,00:17:38,in a public... I guess if she's going to open a library or like you know launch a new Starbucks latte
00:17:38,00:17:44,she can't appear anywhere. But she can't be seen in the same costume that she's worn previously.
00:17:44,00:17:48,Otherwise what happens? Well I think it's just they don't want it to happen and she has a
00:17:48,00:17:54,stylist who has a spreadsheet of every single bit of clothing that she's worn to an appearance and
00:17:54,00:17:58,she make they make sure that nothing matches up and they've given every bit of clothing a
00:17:58,00:18:06,quote name like buttercup for a yellow dress. But she's been going a long time like the queen so
00:18:06,00:18:10,there must be not many clothes left. She's going to be just turning up in a romper suit.
00:18:10,00:18:17,So the headline is always if Kate Middleton wears an outfit twice they say she's recycling her outfits.
00:18:17,00:18:21,Exactly. So you never see that with a queen because of the great spreadsheet that they've made.
00:18:21,00:18:26,And so this guy Stuart Parvin he's the guy who for 11 years was the queen's personal
00:18:26,00:18:32,he dressed her he picked all the clothing. He said in this interview that she has someone employed
00:18:32,00:18:38,specifically to wear her shoes before she wears them. No way. So someone just wears the queen's shoes
00:18:38,00:18:42,and breaks them in. Yeah so they're comfy. Yeah so they're comfy for when she has to wear them for
00:18:42,00:18:45,the first time that she goes to a... So the only person who can have that job is someone who has
00:18:45,00:18:50,exactly the same size and shape feet as the queen I guess. Yeah I read the other day I don't even know
00:18:50,00:18:57,if it's true. I read that Prince Charles has his shoe laces ironed every day. No no no no no no it
00:18:57,00:19:01,might not be true but I did read it. Only if you buy his curly shoe laces like fun ones where you
00:19:01,00:19:08,can get as a kid. I'm sure he does. That's slightly more expensive. Curly fries. So smashing things.
00:19:08,00:19:12,Should we go on to that? Smashing crockery. The Greeks do that don't they? Yeah. Well actually they
00:19:12,00:19:17,don't really do it. It's been this kind of discouraged increase these days. They prefer people not to do
00:19:17,00:19:23,it so much. Not just for the austerity reasons. No they don't really think it's a good idea. But when
00:19:23,00:19:29,they do do it the what they do often is I believe this is true. They'll buy lots of kind of semi-broken
00:19:29,00:19:33,plates like they've already got little cracks in them and they'll have like 19 of those and they're
00:19:33,00:19:39,one real plate and they'll kind of run the real plates along. They've slightly broken ones to make
00:19:39,00:19:43,it look this is real this is real and then they'll smash them all on the floor so often one of them won't
00:19:43,00:19:47,"properly smash because that's the real plate and the other ones aren't really real. Hang on,"
00:19:47,00:19:52,sorry. What cauliflower's a plate as real? As in it's got like cracks it's like like a stunts plate.
00:19:52,00:20:01,You can't still put food on it because you can't put food on it. It's stunt food. But apparently before
00:20:01,00:20:05,they smash plates they used to throw knives at the feet of dancers. I'm going to have to move us
00:20:05,00:20:11,on to the next fact. But if you have anything more go for it. Just one thing like it's quite famous
00:20:11,00:20:18,"that Churring used to chain his teacup to a radiator. Alan Churring. Alan Churring, yeah so the great"
00:20:18,00:20:25,the great computer scientist during in Blechley Park he used to chain his cop to a radiator so that
00:20:25,00:20:29,no one would steal it. Well not like not like to mess with his teacup or anything like Alfred Hitchcock
00:20:29,00:20:35,torturing his teacups. Okay cool. But everyone like thinks of this as a kind of a weird sort of way
00:20:35,00:20:39,that he's quite eccentric but a few years ago they went round to Blechley Park and they were
00:20:39,00:20:46,draining the lake to try and find some enigma machines and when they drained the lake they found
00:20:46,00:20:52,the load of cups in there and apparently Churring's assistant used to just go around with his cop
00:20:52,00:20:56,and they just wander around and throw it in the water. So actually he was quite right to chain it
00:20:56,00:21:02,too because people just used to steal it all the time. Yeah maybe that's why Hitchcock did it to prevent
00:21:02,00:21:11,theft. Okay time for fact number three and that is Andy. My fact is the Romanian equivalent of
00:21:11,00:21:16,comparing apples and oranges is you're comparing grandmothers and machine guns
00:21:16,00:21:24,because those are much more different than apples and oranges are. Yeah apples and oranges are
00:21:24,00:21:29,really similar and there have been studies done on apples and oranges. What did see how similar
00:21:29,00:21:33,they are? It turns out they're different. There was one study in the British Medical Journal in 2000
00:21:33,00:21:37,and it's kind of a joke study but still and he did this whole table of similarities and differences
00:21:37,00:21:43,between apples and oranges. So both round? Both round yes. Both fruit? Yeah I can keep going. No
00:21:43,00:21:55,"no. So in the colour table it says oranges, orange, apples depends on variety. Can be juiced oranges?"
00:21:55,00:22:01,Yes. Apples? Yes. He goes through this whole list of similarities between them. Yeah. And
00:22:01,00:22:06,they are already similar. It turns out. And so why is it grandmothers and grandmothers? I don't know.
00:22:06,00:22:10,It just I think they've picked two very very different things. Oh okay. Yeah. They've just done
00:22:10,00:22:16,better than we did. It's slightly more imaginative than we are. Another thing they say in Romania is
00:22:16,00:22:22,it's like comparing cows and long johns. My favourite one when I was trying to find sort of
00:22:22,00:22:28,interesting things. There's a Spanish proverb and this is the Spanish proverb. There are no ugly 15
00:22:28,00:22:35,year olds. I don't know what context you would ever say. Well in prison? I think. They say.
00:22:35,00:22:41,Well you're honor. I think the court and the jury will agree.
00:22:41,00:22:47,Wow. All children are attractive. Do you want to hear some more Romanian phrases and guess what
00:22:47,00:22:55,"they mean? Oh yeah, sure. Please. You take me out of the watermelons. Is it like something you say"
00:22:55,00:22:59,"to a lady who really kind of blows your mind? Yeah. You give me butterflies. No, it's the opposite."
00:22:59,00:23:05,It's you're making me really angry. Because obviously where do we all want to be among the watermelons?
00:23:05,00:23:10,Yeah. You take me out of the watermelons. Stop this. That explains the problems I had in that
00:23:10,00:23:21,Romanian nightclub. My face has fallen off. Is it literal that one? No. No. I'm surprised. I'm surprised.
00:23:21,00:23:28,And you've put not in the beans. Is that something you might say to well for a pitchcock?
00:23:28,00:23:32,It just means you've made a mistake. It's just a fun way of saying you've made a mistake.
00:23:32,00:23:36,You put not in the beans. I have made a whip out of shit.
00:23:39,00:23:43,It means I've done a lot with a little. I've made a really good effort considering I've got limited
00:23:43,00:23:48,"resources. I'm making a purse from a Salzea, I think. Yeah, I've made a purse from a Salzea and a"
00:23:48,00:23:55,whip out of shit. A whip isn't a spaceship. I mean it's not the most complicated thing you can
00:23:55,00:24:01,"manufacture. Okay, you try making a whip out of shit. I have a friend who lived in South America"
00:24:01,00:24:07,who powered electrically his entire home out of a huge pile of manure in his back garden.
00:24:07,00:24:14,And you're saying making a whip squidging poo into something that could hit someone is like turning
00:24:14,00:24:18,something tiny into something fantastic. I just I would question the logic of that one.
00:24:18,00:24:24,All right. They aren't quite logical. In Germany they say you have tomatoes on your eyes
00:24:24,00:24:31,to mean you're not saying what everyone else can see but why tomatoes? It's always fruit and apples
00:24:31,00:24:35,"especially. So in Spanish, I think they say when you say you're going to walk around the block"
00:24:35,00:24:41,in Spain you'd say let's walk around the apple. Take a walk around the apple. Don't know why.
00:24:41,00:24:47,That's great. It's weird. In Colombia to confuse two things. It's a bit like what are you saying
00:24:47,00:24:55,"before but you would say he confused shit with face cream. Oh, that is a mistake. It is a mistake,"
00:24:55,00:25:04,"yeah. Or one of Alfred Hitchcock's hilarious praise. And if you in Sweden, if you"
00:25:04,00:25:09,if you're talking about someone who hasn't really had to put in much effort to achieve what they've
00:25:09,00:25:16,"achieved, do you say he's slid in on a shrimp sandwich. And that means he got here really easily."
00:25:16,00:25:20,Which actually not that easy to slide on a shrimp sandwich. You have such what priorities about
00:25:20,00:25:26,what's easy and what's hard. It's easy to slip on a shrimp sandwich. It's very hard to compress
00:25:26,00:25:30,turds together to make him a working whip. Indiana Jones's whip wasn't made of poo.
00:25:32,00:25:36,We don't know that. I think we think we have very different skill sets. What is slipping
00:25:36,00:25:41,is very different to sliding. So you can slip on it but sliding in that implies that you're
00:25:41,00:25:45,skiing into the into the piece. And we'll can see the skiing on a shrimp sandwich will be hard.
00:25:45,00:25:51,They don't want to be quite difficult. Are any of these are any of these actually said in these
00:25:51,00:25:56,countries? It's a weird one that because we occasionally do this kind of thing on QI and when we
00:25:56,00:26:03,ever say it we'll say okay in Thailand they say the hens is a snake's feet and the snake sees the
00:26:03,00:26:08,hens boobs and that means two people who know each other's secret. We'll say something like that on QI
00:26:08,00:26:14,and then everyone in Thailand will email us and say no we don't say that at all. I think it will be
00:26:14,00:26:18,said and I think it's just people like I haven't heard every phrase that gets used in Britain.
00:26:18,00:26:24,I think that's right. If there are people from Sweden or Spain or Germany who know that we're
00:26:24,00:26:29,wrong please do heckle. So just like we were talking about grandmothers and machine guns right at the
00:26:29,00:26:36,start so maybe a few things about guns. Yeah. Yeah. You know how old you have to be to get a firearms
00:26:36,00:26:43,license in the UK? Is it 12? It's 14. Okay. Do you know how old you have to be to get a shotgun
00:26:43,00:26:50,license? No. You have to be two. No way. And the reason you have to be two is because an adult needs
00:26:50,00:26:59,to sign for you saying they've known you for at least two years. And I can confirm here's a fit
00:26:59,00:27:07,and proper person. There's loads of people like under 10 in the UK who have shotgun licenses but you
00:27:07,00:27:12,can't buy a shotgun until you're certain age although an adult could buy you a shotgun. Does anyone
00:27:12,00:27:19,have a shotgun license? Well just that child on the front ground. How old are you? 19. So you've had it
00:27:19,00:27:25,for 17 years. You must be very good. The person who invented the first portable automatic machine
00:27:25,00:27:31,gun was guy called Hiram Maxim. He's kind of a bit famous and he was arrested an old age. He also
00:27:31,00:27:38,invented the traditional mouse trap that people use. He was arrested an old age in 1913 for harassing
00:27:38,00:27:46,salvation army workers with a pea shooter. But better that than the machine gun. I read a story
00:27:46,00:27:51,about him which was that when he invented the machine gun but was testing it out in his neighborhood.
00:27:51,00:27:56,He went to all his neighbors saying sorry to bother at 3 p.m. today or whatever time he said
00:27:56,00:28:02,I'm going to be testing out my new machine gun. If you could open your windows the noise is so great
00:28:02,00:28:06,in this vicinity all smash all the glass in your house if the windows are shut could you really
00:28:06,00:28:10,consider it? Yeah he sounds like a nice guy. I think he showed off the gun there was an early
00:28:10,00:28:14,demonstration of the machine gun and he was because it was Queen Victoria who was the queen at the time
00:28:14,00:28:18,and one of the things he did to demonstrate how cool it was was he blasted with the machine gun the
00:28:18,00:28:26,letters V R for Victoria Regina into a brick wall. Yeah that was the thing. When you would you trust
00:28:26,00:28:31,a man who said I'm going to be practicing with my machine gun this morning can I ask that you open
00:28:31,00:28:41,your windows for me. I mean it doesn't really make any difference whether you do or not. We're
00:28:41,00:28:46,going to have to move on. So time for our final fact and that is James Harkin. Okay my fact this
00:28:46,00:28:56,week is that replacement eyelets can be made from foreskins. I told you I told you they would
00:28:56,00:29:02,have grown. Has this actually been done? It's been done yeah it has been done. You might lose your
00:29:02,00:29:06,eyelid for you might get a disease or you might it might be burned. Someone might be practicing
00:29:06,00:29:12,with a machine gun next door. Exactly and then the problem is your eyelid is kind of really thin
00:29:12,00:29:16,kind of skin and so it's really hard to find replacement skin from around the body and there are
00:29:16,00:29:21,a few different places to get it but the foreskin works particularly well and people have had
00:29:21,00:29:30,their eyelets replaced with foreskins. Do they what what do they get to replace their foreskin
00:29:30,00:29:36,"so they get another foreskin from somewhere else? No, it's like a pyramid scheme of foreskins."
00:29:36,00:29:43,They do that. If your foreskin is on your eyelid are you circumcised or is that does a
00:29:43,00:29:47,foreskin have to be fully removed or does it just have to remove them it's original position?
00:29:47,00:29:53,That's a very good question. James I feel like I'm going to let you down. I don't know the correct
00:29:53,00:29:58,answer. You should really read the Torah because it must be in there somewhere. Just quickly before
00:29:58,00:30:03,we get into foreskin valley. If you don't have a this is really really cool. If you don't have
00:30:03,00:30:08,if your eyelids don't work so the eyelid is there and it's intact but it need it doesn't operate
00:30:08,00:30:14,the muscles don't work to move it. One way that doctors can fix it is they take gold thread
00:30:14,00:30:18,and because they use gold in the body because it doesn't react with anything it's inert chemically
00:30:18,00:30:23,and it's the thread they use is a hundred times thinner than a human hair and they thread it
00:30:23,00:30:27,through the eyelid which gives it a bit of stability and it stiffens it and what that means is
00:30:27,00:30:32,it's stiff enough to open and close the eye but you have to do it by hand so you just do this.
00:30:32,00:30:36,You just really have nothing to go. Yeah I'm awake or whatever it is that you do. Isn't that
00:30:36,00:30:46,incredible? Yeah so you can wink at someone by just going. I read this thing this isn't really
00:30:46,00:30:51,related but one of the early butter augmentation surgeries the guy who invented butter called
00:30:51,00:30:58,mentation basically took a breast kind of silicon thing from a breast and just put it in someone's
00:30:58,00:31:03,but that's basically the way he did it but the problem was it didn't really look like a
00:31:03,00:31:10,bottom so it didn't really work. Is that what it did? And so what they did instead is they managed to get
00:31:10,00:31:14,like something that was better sculpted and put it in between the gluteus maximus and I think the
00:31:14,00:31:20,gluteus minimus and so it actually looked a bit like a butterk and this was the first proper real
00:31:20,00:31:27,butter called mentation surgery but the problem was that it kept slipping and so what you could do is
00:31:27,00:31:31,someone would go oh your butterk slipped and then you could actually lift it up and put it back
00:31:31,00:31:35,in place. How far down did it slip? Could go as far as out of your trousers or something.
00:31:35,00:31:41,Oh sorry. It could go quite far down the thigh I think. Oh my god.
00:31:41,00:31:46,Interesting that isn't it? Yeah that's amazing. I wonder if you still say someone had a nice
00:31:46,00:31:52,arse if it was just halfway down the cob. I read about the first penis transplant the other day
00:31:52,00:31:57,which they've successfully done. Yeah and they knew they could do it for a long time and this guy
00:31:57,00:32:01,wanted to have it done and the only issue was is that for four to five years it was I guess to the
00:32:01,00:32:12,tail end of four years they couldn't find a donor. That's very reasonable. I heard that they used
00:32:12,00:32:18,a middle finger once for a penis transplant. No I've read this and they're all looking and I've got no
00:32:18,00:32:22,evidence either. I've forgotten all the sources and I read it five or six years ago anyway. It's
00:32:22,00:32:28,already quite bad when someone gives you the finger in the street. It was also attached to the groin
00:32:28,00:32:35,it would be ten times worse. Let's say some stuff on eyelids specifically. Pioneering French surgeon
00:32:35,00:32:43,Ambrose Paray. If you had etching eyelids he suggested washing your eyelids in urine
00:32:43,00:32:51,but only if the urine had been kept all night in a barber's basin. Okay it's very specific isn't it?
00:32:51,00:32:56,What does do you have to have the consent of the barber presumably? You can't just wean a barber's
00:32:56,00:32:59,basin. Yeah they go in the next day. Oh yeah sir I've been using basin four. I hope you don't mind
00:32:59,00:33:04,my eyelids are itchy. Do you want to hear another really interesting body part replacement thing?
00:33:04,00:33:08,Yes please. This guy is great. Okay there's a Finnish computer programmer. His name is Jerry
00:33:08,00:33:15,Gelava and in 2008 he lost a finger. He lost his third finger in a motorbike accident so he replaced
00:33:15,00:33:25,it with his penis. Yeah his typing has not improved. Everyone was saying oh it's so annoying for you
00:33:25,00:33:28,because you type for a living don't you because you're a computer programmer you're going to be really
00:33:28,00:33:32,it's going to be really annoying for you and he said yes yes it is going to be really annoying and
00:33:32,00:33:37,eventually he decided to do something about it and he built himself a prosthetic finger not only that
00:33:37,00:33:44,it doubles up as a USB drive. So all he has to do he just peels back his prosthetic fingernail and
00:33:44,00:33:48,there's a there's a he can just plug into a computer. No no no no one can ever just plug in a USB
00:33:48,00:33:55,into a computer. I'm sorry upside down and then yeah yeah and so he he can store two gigabytes of
00:33:55,00:33:59,data in his finger and he can even remove the whole finger and give it to someone else if they
00:33:59,00:34:03,need to store a file or something. How cool is that? Amazing yeah what a great guy. I don't know if
00:34:03,00:34:11,I'd accept that. If you ask someone they have a spare USB. Oh yeah. It's a great idea. Another
00:34:11,00:34:17,on eyes and yeah like replacement surgery you know if so in 2009 I think was the first instance of
00:34:17,00:34:25,this woman who'd been blind for nine years had her eye replaced with her tooth and she could see again
00:34:25,00:34:30,and so this sometimes people are having surgery to get their cornea replaced with their tooth
00:34:30,00:34:36,and they make so they drill a hole in the tooth and they make a little lens in it and then they
00:34:36,00:34:40,have to implant it in a different part of your body because the lens needs to properly fuse I think
00:34:40,00:34:46,with the tooth first of all so they implanted it in her shoulder for a while. This is her tooth
00:34:46,00:34:51,and then they can put it in the eye if you google images very weird but there are people who've had
00:34:51,00:34:56,their teeth in their eyes and they can see properly and they just line it up with the retina
00:34:56,00:35:00,and it's people who've got corneal problems where it's gone blurry so. That's amazing. It's great.
00:35:00,00:35:04,You can pat someone on the shoulder and on the eye and on the tooth at the same time.
00:35:04,00:35:09,That is so incredible. That's the main benefit that's what they say they're all pleased about.
00:35:09,00:35:12,We're going to have to wrap up soon so should we? James?
00:35:12,00:35:19,Okay well just on what you were saying you can get stem cells these days can do all sorts of things
00:35:19,00:35:24,and people there was a lady who kind of ingested some stem cells into her wrinkles around her eyes
00:35:24,00:35:28,because she wanted to get rid of the wrinkles and it was hope that it would grow back
00:35:28,00:35:32,and then suddenly whenever she kind of winked her eyes she heard this bony clicking
00:35:33,00:35:44,and it turned out that a bone had grown in her eyelid. I know. I've got some light
00:35:44,00:35:50,"entertains up about four skin depending on what's it? Oh hang on, all night is that eyelid"
00:35:50,00:35:53,quickly because I've always wanted to know this. You know is that thing when you're eyelid in
00:35:53,00:36:00,voluntarily twitches? Like you have a twitching eyelid so that's called blepharous plasm or blepharous
00:36:00,00:36:06,plasm and so it's usually it's usually fine and harmless some people have it so badly that
00:36:06,00:36:12,eyelids get locked shut and a cure that was proposed for that in the late 1700s was by a doctor
00:36:12,00:36:17,Gerald and he suggested that. He doesn't sound like a real doctor. If any doctor only gives you
00:36:17,00:36:24,their first name that's a real danger sign like Dr Nick in The Simpsons. So Dr. Jess advised that
00:36:24,00:36:28,people who had this problem with their eyes were clamped shut because their blepharous plasm was
00:36:28,00:36:34,so bad. Don't try and cure the spasm drill a hole in their eyelid so that they can see through it.
00:36:34,00:36:40,I actually don't know if anyone had that done but it's lateral thinking.
00:36:40,00:36:45,Oh hope not. Also blepharous plasm are playing on the obelisk stage at 9pm tonight.
00:36:45,00:36:50,"Secret gigs are checking them out. They're very good. Four skins, humorous four skins? Oh no."
00:36:50,00:36:58,All right there's a bit bit PG-13 but some cosmetics are tested on four skins but ones that have
00:36:58,00:37:02,been removed. If someone is circumcised when they're born the hospital normally sells the four
00:37:02,00:37:08,skin. There is a man out there who's been circumcised and his cells have been used and grown and grown
00:37:08,00:37:13,and grown and grown and grown to make an entire face cream company. But here's the thing it um there
00:37:13,00:37:17,was a whole anti because when people found out that four skins were being used for cosmetics
00:37:17,00:37:23,there was a huge um anti-four skin movement that tried to stop it and it turns out Oprah Winfrey has
00:37:23,00:37:30,released four skin products um not for your four skin for like four skin face products and they said
00:37:30,00:37:38,product name four skin. That's brilliant. Yes. So obvious. Yeah but so that's the amazing thing about
00:37:38,00:37:43,it. It's not as if they're carting off lots of four skins to turn into face cream. It's one
00:37:43,00:37:47,singular four skin that they've been using for 20 years. Well they come that there are lots of four
00:37:47,00:37:52,skins but yeah you can use them for up to yeah I think 40 years. Because it's just the cells in
00:37:52,00:37:56,that are very unusual and there's uh did you say that they're like stem cells and they can be grown
00:37:56,00:38:00,and used in lots of different ways and they're yeah they're incredible medically yeah that's insane.
00:38:00,00:38:05,Um we're gonna have to wrap up in a sec so if anyone's got anything a final fact they want to
00:38:05,00:38:10,throw in? No. No we're good. Uh okay all right that's it that's all of our facts thanks so much for
