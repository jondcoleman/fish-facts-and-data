 [Music]

00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:21.120
 Hello everybody! Hi there! Welcome to your latest installment of Meet the Elf.

00:00:21.120 --> 00:00:25.280
 Or Meet the Elves. That's what James called it but I call it Meet the Elf because there's one

00:00:25.280 --> 00:00:32.960
 elf to meet and this week it is James Rawson. Hi James! Hi Anna, hi Andy, hi Dan, hey!

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:40.000
 We're here as well. We are here! Yes and I'm also joined by Andy and Dan as usual

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:47.440
 and I'm Anna. And James is probably the longest serving elf as I from us I reckon now.

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:53.440
 Alex Bell might not like you saying that but I'll go along with it. I'd never count him.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:01:00.480
 Yeah. You are the creative head of development, is that correct?

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:02.880
 No, no, no. Again so many people won't like what you're saying.

00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:07.760
 This is so exciting! I'm actually the managing director.

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:11.120
 What was it like when you founded and thought of the idea for QI all those years ago?

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:14.720
 Are you the Blackadder producer as well? Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:19.600
 Why don't we, as part of the show, why don't we ask the elf to tell us

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:22.640
 some things about themselves rather than assuming all the incorrect information?

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:28.960
 And you have bright blonde hair, don't you? And actually you've got five testicles.

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:32.320
 My underpants feel like a glove.

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:37.440
 Yes, James, sorry, tell us what you do at QI.

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:43.200
 Okay, so I'm head of digital which is all social channels. I'm also a development producer which

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:49.600
 means trying to come up with new TV shows. Occasionally I'll edit a book, I'll do a radio,

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:53.520
 two-spot, you know, we all wear many hats and those are some of mine.

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:58.320
 And I knew that, James. I knew all of that as well. I don't know why we allowed Anna the Reigns here.

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:03.760
 I don't really know all the terminology and development producer to me is the same as head

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:10.400
 of, you produce the development, but I understand that that might ruffle some feathers, so let's

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:14.960
 move on. You have brought with you today a fact, is that correct?

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:23.200
 I brought a question, Anna. Do you feel like any moment you're going to wake up and this will

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:28.800
 all have been a horrible dream? It may seem like a dream because you are naked right now,

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:36.080
 but I assume that's the choice you made. I thought we all agreed that. I think I'm getting it right

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:41.360
 and you guys are getting it wrong, so I am just going to keep plowing on. You've brought a question

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:49.440
 to which the answer is going to be a fact. Correct. Okay, fine. I'll take it. So without further ado,

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:52.480
 I would say we should get on with you asking us this question,

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:57.200
 us grappling our way to the answer for it. Yeah, everyone agree? Oh yeah, agreed.

00:02:57.200 --> 00:03:03.920
 Great. What's your question, James? Tornus nuclear power plant in Scotland was attacked in 2011

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:10.560
 and forced to temporarily shut down. Similar attacks have taken place on power plants in Israel,

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:17.760
 Japan, the United States, the Philippines, South Korea, India and Sweden. Going back as far as

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:27.600
 1937. What is the story behind these attacks? Oh, I was so hoping for a pop culture question this

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:34.080
 time. No, I've gone for counter programming. Rolson for people who've not yet met him is probably

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:41.760
 got more knowledge about the world of pop music, particularly, I would say late 90s, early 2000s

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:48.880
 girl bands. That seems to be in your pocket. So that's what I was really hoping for. Well, Dan,

00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:54.240
 we haven't ruled that out yet. It might be that. It could be the Saturdays. Oh, yes. Yes.

00:03:54.240 --> 00:04:01.760
 Oh, where all these power plants be witched? The first CD single I ever bought was by be witch.

00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:05.760
 Really? Was it Sailor V or one of their more difficult follow up singles?

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:14.880
 It was Sailor V. Rather than the minimalist Zen funk, they started pumping out my school guitar

00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:20.320
 teacher who taught me my first lessons wrote one of the B-sides for the for a bewitched album.

00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:26.080
 Wow. Yeah, well, not the album, the B-side. Yeah. So that's huge. Thanks for bringing bewitched to

00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:30.320
 the table here, James. No, absolutely. They're back, right? They're back. Are they?

00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:34.320
 Yeah, no, they had an IP out. Sorry, you might hear my two hour barking in the background.

00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:40.240
 She's also a guest on today's show. So yeah, be witched do have an EP out this year.

00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:44.480
 That's what I can confirm. That is not my fact. Because your fact was about power plants being

00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:48.560
 attacked. And you said nuclear plants, didn't you? The first one was a Scottish nuclear plant.

00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:55.280
 Okay, so it has happened to a variety of power plants, including coal plants. But recently,

00:04:55.280 --> 00:04:59.280
 it's been happening more with nuclear power plants, but could happen to any power plant.

00:04:59.280 --> 00:05:04.480
 The first nuclear plant didn't open in the UK until I think about the mid 50s or 1960.

00:05:04.480 --> 00:05:06.640
 But the very exciting thing was that was opened by the Queen.

00:05:06.640 --> 00:05:15.040
 So the 1937 attack was on a coal plant in Australia, if that helps?

00:05:15.040 --> 00:05:20.480
 I found out the other day, and I actually then found out that we'd run it on QI, but I was

00:05:20.480 --> 00:05:25.120
 unaware of that. But you know, Colesden Newcastle, they're saying, you know, it's like bringing

00:05:25.120 --> 00:05:31.200
 Colesden Newcastle. Yeah, that still can be said. You say, you know, the idea is obviously

00:05:31.200 --> 00:05:34.960
 that Newcastle is such a huge coal producer, it'd be stupid to bring Coles there.

00:05:34.960 --> 00:05:38.000
 What do you know that Newcastle is still the biggest coal producer in the world?

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:44.960
 Is that Cheryl Cole? Hey, nice. Not the audience for my Cheryl Cole gags, is it?

00:05:44.960 --> 00:05:47.440
 What do you mean Newcastle the biggest coal producer? No, it's not.

00:05:47.440 --> 00:05:52.800
 It is Andy. It is. What, what can I mean? Sorry. Newcastle, Newcastle, Australia?

00:05:52.800 --> 00:05:57.040
 Yeah, I think that's so cool. Oh, nice. That is cool, yeah.

00:05:57.040 --> 00:06:01.840
 Anyway, sorry, going back to this cryptic question. No, can I distract, can I distract

00:06:01.840 --> 00:06:05.760
 with one more thing? You know, isn't Gateshead just next to Newcastle?

00:06:05.760 --> 00:06:10.480
 In the UK it is, yeah. In the UK it is, yeah. And that is one of my favourite facts, is that

00:06:10.480 --> 00:06:14.480
 there's a slang term called getting off at Gateshead, which is the rude one.

00:06:14.480 --> 00:06:18.800
 I know that. I know the Liverpool version, which is getting off at more fields, I think,

00:06:18.800 --> 00:06:23.680
 before Lime Street. It's to disembark from your mode of transport before it reaches

00:06:23.680 --> 00:06:27.920
 the terminal point, and it means having coitus, interruptus, sex.

00:06:27.920 --> 00:06:34.400
 I think we would have got it without you even having to explain what it meant after you said

00:06:34.400 --> 00:06:39.200
 the metaphorical thing. Cool. That's good. So are we doing facts now that have to make

00:06:39.200 --> 00:06:43.200
 their word geographically around the UK from Newcastle to Pasta?

00:06:43.200 --> 00:06:47.280
 Well, I've got another, Liz Truss's nickname is Dagonant because she's three stops beyond

00:06:47.280 --> 00:06:49.360
 barking, which is... Nice.

00:06:49.360 --> 00:06:53.040
 Sorry, I found that out yesterday. That's very good.

00:06:53.040 --> 00:06:55.360
 Right, power plants. Power plants.

00:06:55.360 --> 00:07:00.880
 Is it, can I just say, I think it's very brave of you to do a fact which has the threat of

00:07:00.880 --> 00:07:05.600
 nuclear disaster lingering in the background in a week where Iran, a nuclear power, has

00:07:05.600 --> 00:07:11.440
 just decided to evolve itself in a war zone. Well done, brave.

00:07:11.440 --> 00:07:12.560
 Thank you for keeping it light, Anna.

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:17.360
 I think it's important sometimes to... I think if you're listening to this in the aftertimes

00:07:17.360 --> 00:07:22.160
 and you send in the correct answer now, you get an extra ration of millet.

00:07:22.160 --> 00:07:28.240
 Fine, let's get back to some pop groups, shall we?

00:07:28.240 --> 00:07:30.960
 Is it birds?

00:07:30.960 --> 00:07:33.040
 It's not birds. Oh, that's birds.

00:07:33.040 --> 00:07:36.080
 Okay, because they sometimes attack power lines, don't they, and bring things down.

00:07:36.080 --> 00:07:36.640
 It's a good guess.

00:07:36.640 --> 00:07:40.400
 Sorry, are we talking, sorry, was it power lines, not power stations?

00:07:40.400 --> 00:07:43.600
 It's power plants specifically. It's the stations.

00:07:43.600 --> 00:07:45.760
 So what can bring down a station?

00:07:45.760 --> 00:07:47.360
 And they're all over the world as well.

00:07:47.360 --> 00:07:50.560
 So it feels like it's a natural phenomenon rather than...

00:07:50.560 --> 00:07:53.120
 Humans are all over the world too famously.

00:07:53.120 --> 00:07:56.720
 How did, well, how did the power plant get there without said humans?

00:07:56.720 --> 00:08:04.320
 Is it they've all suffered a malfunction and by incredible coincidence,

00:08:04.320 --> 00:08:06.800
 the human behind it has always been named Homer?

00:08:06.800 --> 00:08:07.520
 No, it's good.

00:08:07.520 --> 00:08:08.880
 No, good guess, but no.

00:08:08.880 --> 00:08:09.360
 It is good.

00:08:10.080 --> 00:08:17.760
 So of all the guesses so far, Anna's is probably the closest with birds, although not birds.

00:08:17.760 --> 00:08:18.080
 Bees.

00:08:18.080 --> 00:08:20.960
 Not bees either.

00:08:20.960 --> 00:08:22.560
 It's something natural though, isn't it?

00:08:22.560 --> 00:08:23.040
 Yeah.

00:08:23.040 --> 00:08:26.960
 It's quite good, the idea of a sinister organization devoted to, you know,

00:08:26.960 --> 00:08:31.520
 cancelling people's electricity, which has been operating since the 1930s.

00:08:31.520 --> 00:08:35.200
 Like that's a cool premise for a Bond film or something, but the baddies are...

00:08:35.200 --> 00:08:36.480
 Or a dystopian novel.

00:08:36.480 --> 00:08:38.720
 It's got to be something simpler.

00:08:38.720 --> 00:08:41.760
 Like, you know those, I don't know what those flowers are called,

00:08:41.760 --> 00:08:45.680
 but you pick up that have all the white bits sticking out that you blow and they fly away.

00:08:45.680 --> 00:08:47.840
 Dandelions.

00:08:47.840 --> 00:08:49.040
 Dandelions.

00:08:49.040 --> 00:08:50.080
 They're very obscure.

00:08:50.080 --> 00:08:52.480
 Dan, that is a, that's a root one flower.

00:08:52.480 --> 00:08:53.280
 I know them.

00:08:53.280 --> 00:08:54.560
 I just couldn't remember the name.

00:08:54.560 --> 00:08:55.840
 It's got my name in it as well.

00:08:55.840 --> 00:08:59.120
 That should be a very close one to me.

00:08:59.920 --> 00:09:07.920
 Is it dandelion carried in the breeze that is sort of clogging some sort of a bit of the system?

00:09:07.920 --> 00:09:10.880
 So the word that you've got there is clogging.

00:09:10.880 --> 00:09:11.680
 Yeah.

00:09:11.680 --> 00:09:14.080
 Stick with clogging.

00:09:14.080 --> 00:09:15.520
 Something natural that clogs.

00:09:15.520 --> 00:09:19.520
 Some mud or dust, silt.

00:09:19.520 --> 00:09:21.040
 Is it related to water?

00:09:21.040 --> 00:09:22.560
 It is related to water.

00:09:22.560 --> 00:09:27.200
 Is it something to do with like a big shoal of some kind of fish

00:09:27.200 --> 00:09:31.680
 that sometimes gets in the way of, because of the power?

00:09:31.680 --> 00:09:34.160
 Power stations all have water inlets.

00:09:34.160 --> 00:09:35.360
 They're basically big kettles.

00:09:35.360 --> 00:09:38.000
 No matter what the power they're using, whether it's nuclear or coal or whatever,

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:40.480
 they basically heat water into steam, turns into a termite.

00:09:40.480 --> 00:09:41.680
 So they need to be near rivers.

00:09:41.680 --> 00:09:42.320
 Obviously.

00:09:42.320 --> 00:09:43.440
 Yeah, okay.

00:09:43.440 --> 00:09:46.240
 I do have a cool power fact for you just to digress.

00:09:46.240 --> 00:09:48.160
 And it was on the show I wanted to mention at 80s ago,

00:09:48.160 --> 00:09:51.840
 because I read that book Power Up about renewable energy and all of that.

00:09:51.840 --> 00:09:54.080
 And it was about, you know, liquid natural gas.

00:09:54.080 --> 00:09:56.400
 So if you cool it down to minus 200 degrees,

00:09:56.400 --> 00:09:59.600
 it turns into a liquid and you can then put it under high pressure

00:09:59.600 --> 00:10:01.840
 into ships and transport it around the world, right?

00:10:01.840 --> 00:10:04.480
 Okay, I didn't know that, but yes.

00:10:04.480 --> 00:10:08.000
 Okay, so like when Russia invaded Ukraine and all the gas was turned off coming from there,

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:11.520
 we had to turn to American gas, which has to be put on liquid natural gas ships.

00:10:11.520 --> 00:10:14.960
 They've got these huge domes on to transport the gas at minus,

00:10:14.960 --> 00:10:16.880
 you know, incredibly low temperatures.

00:10:16.880 --> 00:10:18.320
 So it stays liquid, right?

00:10:18.320 --> 00:10:19.280
 That's amazing.

00:10:19.280 --> 00:10:21.760
 You turn the gas into a liquid to transport it and then...

00:10:21.760 --> 00:10:22.640
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:10:22.640 --> 00:10:23.680
 It's very, very cool.

00:10:24.960 --> 00:10:27.280
 Well, I think it might still be liquid at the point of burning, actually.

00:10:27.280 --> 00:10:32.560
 Anyway, but the first ship ever built to transport that stuff

00:10:32.560 --> 00:10:36.000
 was, I think, in the late 40s, and it was called the Methane Princess.

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:37.360
 Ooh, lovely.

00:10:37.360 --> 00:10:38.560
 What a great name for a ship.

00:10:38.560 --> 00:10:41.680
 That actually used to be Queen Elizabeth's nickname.

00:10:41.680 --> 00:10:44.960
 Yeah, that's brilliant.

00:10:44.960 --> 00:10:45.840
 So is that it, Rawson?

00:10:45.840 --> 00:10:48.560
 Is water somehow getting gummed up?

00:10:48.560 --> 00:10:52.240
 Well, Anna said some type of fish.

00:10:52.240 --> 00:10:56.240
 And actually, interestingly, you could debate whether or not this is a type of fish.

00:10:56.240 --> 00:10:56.960
 Jelly?

00:10:56.960 --> 00:10:58.000
 With the cabbage?

00:10:58.000 --> 00:10:59.040
 Jellyfish, indeed.

00:10:59.040 --> 00:11:00.800
 Oh, wow.

00:11:00.800 --> 00:11:03.120
 Because they're so gummy.

00:11:03.120 --> 00:11:04.560
 Yeah, so they're so gummy.

00:11:04.560 --> 00:11:06.240
 So there's quite a few factors at play here.

00:11:06.240 --> 00:11:11.760
 Obviously, as discussed, power plants have to be by large bodies of water,

00:11:11.760 --> 00:11:17.200
 which all gets filtered through to cool down the power plants to get very hot.

00:11:18.800 --> 00:11:22.480
 But they all have systems in place to filter out aquatic life,

00:11:22.480 --> 00:11:27.920
 but the sheer volume of a jellyfish bloom just completely overwhelms the system,

00:11:27.920 --> 00:11:32.320
 and they can have to shut down for sort of a day, two days, which costs millions of pounds.

00:11:32.320 --> 00:11:36.240
 But it's getting worse, and they're happening more frequently,

00:11:36.240 --> 00:11:40.560
 because as the waters heat up, jellyfish love that.

00:11:40.560 --> 00:11:43.920
 And as the waters get more acidic, jellyfish like that, too.

00:11:43.920 --> 00:11:47.120
 So we're getting bigger and bigger and bigger jellyfish blooms,

00:11:47.120 --> 00:11:49.920
 which are creating more and more problems for nuclear power plants.

00:11:49.920 --> 00:11:53.200
 So it's happening more and more often.

00:11:53.200 --> 00:11:53.600
 Amazing.

00:11:53.600 --> 00:11:54.000
 Oh, wow.

00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:56.160
 Very interesting.

00:11:56.160 --> 00:12:01.600
 Is that ironic that nuclear power plants are possible weapon in the fight against climate change?

00:12:01.600 --> 00:12:01.600
 Yeah.

00:12:01.600 --> 00:12:03.840
 Are being stymied?

00:12:03.840 --> 00:12:06.880
 Well, the jellyfish like climate change,

00:12:06.880 --> 00:12:11.680
 so they've obviously got a vested interest in sabotaging renewable power sources.

00:12:11.680 --> 00:12:13.120
 Of course.

00:12:13.120 --> 00:12:15.920
 Wow, so when we do completely destroy the planet,

00:12:15.920 --> 00:12:18.720
 because the oceans are pure acid and boiling hot,

00:12:18.720 --> 00:12:21.280
 the jellyfish are going to be over the world because they love it.

00:12:21.280 --> 00:12:22.880
 Yeah, they've been playing the long game.

00:12:22.880 --> 00:12:23.680
 That's very cool.

00:12:23.680 --> 00:12:25.920
 Do we know how we remedy the situation?

00:12:25.920 --> 00:12:28.400
 Does someone have to go down and clear the jellyfish out?

00:12:28.400 --> 00:12:31.520
 So there was one in India where they counted four million jellyfish

00:12:31.520 --> 00:12:33.680
 that they had to remove from the systems.

00:12:33.680 --> 00:12:38.320
 They're looking into drones to sort of monitor jellyfish blooms,

00:12:38.320 --> 00:12:40.400
 so they can get a bit of a head's up.

00:12:40.400 --> 00:12:44.160
 And also acoustic systems whereby they can listen out,

00:12:44.160 --> 00:12:45.520
 not sure what noise the jellyfish makes,

00:12:45.520 --> 00:12:48.560
 listen out for large groups of jellyfish.

00:12:48.560 --> 00:12:52.720
 But obviously it's a real problem if you should down a power plant for 24 hours.

00:12:52.720 --> 00:12:53.360
 That's...

00:12:53.360 --> 00:12:53.760
 Yeah.

00:12:53.760 --> 00:12:56.400
 The Suffolk nuclear plants, what are they called?

00:12:56.400 --> 00:13:01.520
 Sizewell, they, I think, have fish detectors,

00:13:01.520 --> 00:13:03.760
 or they, because they're building a new one at the moment,

00:13:03.760 --> 00:13:06.240
 I think it's going to include a kind of fish water slide system

00:13:06.240 --> 00:13:09.280
 where if any fish goes in, it gets filtered out,

00:13:09.280 --> 00:13:13.440
 and then goes on a magical journey and then goes pop back out into the sea.

00:13:13.440 --> 00:13:15.200
 And none of its friends will ever believe it.

00:13:15.200 --> 00:13:17.360
 I think that's the idea behind what's happening there.

00:13:17.360 --> 00:13:17.920
 That's very...

00:13:17.920 --> 00:13:20.960
 So we'll just see fish queuing, flocking and queuing up

00:13:20.960 --> 00:13:22.320
 to take the sizewell right.

00:13:22.320 --> 00:13:24.080
 Sorry, you have to be six inches long to go.

00:13:24.080 --> 00:13:30.240
 I don't know how a jellyfish bloom happens.

00:13:30.240 --> 00:13:34.160
 Is that jellyfish reproducing, or is that them all coming together?

00:13:34.160 --> 00:13:36.160
 I don't know, it's like a convention, isn't it?

00:13:36.160 --> 00:13:37.760
 Is it like a comic book thing?

00:13:37.760 --> 00:13:38.560
 Yeah, I think so.

00:13:38.560 --> 00:13:38.960
 Okay.

00:13:41.760 --> 00:13:42.880
 That was such nerds.

00:13:42.880 --> 00:13:44.000
 Cool.

00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:47.200
 That's very good.

00:13:47.200 --> 00:13:49.280
 Well, you have actually brought with you, James,

00:13:49.280 --> 00:13:51.920
 some secret follow-up facts, right?

00:13:51.920 --> 00:13:53.200
 Well, always come prepared.

00:13:53.200 --> 00:13:55.360
 So I've got a couple of backups.

00:13:55.360 --> 00:13:57.840
 These are more pop culture geared.

00:13:57.840 --> 00:13:58.800
 Yes, here we go.

00:13:58.800 --> 00:14:00.000
 We'll be glad to know.

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:00.880
 Now, here's the thing.

00:14:00.880 --> 00:14:04.080
 We should just say as well as all the hats that Rawson wears

00:14:04.080 --> 00:14:05.520
 as part of his QI world.

00:14:05.520 --> 00:14:07.120
 When we say he's in development,

00:14:07.120 --> 00:14:08.720
 he not only is in development,

00:14:08.720 --> 00:14:11.600
 but he has done almost what's virtually an impossible thing

00:14:11.600 --> 00:14:12.320
 in the world of TV.

00:14:12.320 --> 00:14:15.680
 He's taken an idea and taken it from the page

00:14:15.680 --> 00:14:16.800
 all the way to the TV.

00:14:16.800 --> 00:14:19.760
 Because he created the tournament TV show,

00:14:19.760 --> 00:14:22.480
 which ran for a few series with Alex Scott,

00:14:22.480 --> 00:14:25.200
 who was the former English footballer.

00:14:25.200 --> 00:14:26.080
 She was the host.

00:14:26.080 --> 00:14:30.480
 It's in your bones, isn't it?

00:14:30.480 --> 00:14:31.680
 Even before QI,

00:14:31.680 --> 00:14:34.560
 you were a dude who was on TV shows as a quiz-er.

00:14:34.560 --> 00:14:36.960
 This is your big love, isn't it?

00:14:36.960 --> 00:14:39.120
 Yes, so I've done Countdown.

00:14:39.120 --> 00:14:41.440
 That was the main show that I did.

00:14:41.440 --> 00:14:44.960
 I just like formats and pulling them apart

00:14:44.960 --> 00:14:46.800
 and destroying them and putting them back together,

00:14:46.800 --> 00:14:49.920
 which is entirely what I plan to do on your format today.

00:14:49.920 --> 00:14:52.480
 And yeah, we had the tournament.

00:14:52.480 --> 00:14:54.320
 We had two series of that on BBC One.

00:14:54.320 --> 00:14:56.240
 I don't think it's available to stream on iPlayer,

00:14:56.240 --> 00:14:57.200
 but you know, never mind.

00:14:57.200 --> 00:15:00.800
 Find it, find it out there somewhere.

00:15:00.800 --> 00:15:02.720
 It really was quite a single-handed, wasn't it?

00:15:02.720 --> 00:15:06.000
 You had this idea, and then it actually happened.

00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:08.480
 Yeah, I mean, Dan was in the chat as well,

00:15:08.480 --> 00:15:09.920
 Anna, Simon or exec.

00:15:10.880 --> 00:15:12.960
 Sure, so they held it back for a while,

00:15:12.960 --> 00:15:16.480
 but eventually you managed to fight them down.

00:15:16.480 --> 00:15:19.760
 Yeah, I mean, it actually came from playing Fortnite during lockdown,

00:15:19.760 --> 00:15:21.920
 which is a battle royale game

00:15:21.920 --> 00:15:24.560
 where a bunch of people get dropped on a computer game island

00:15:24.560 --> 00:15:26.640
 and get given various weapons,

00:15:26.640 --> 00:15:28.640
 and the last one surviving wins.

00:15:28.640 --> 00:15:29.600
 And I just thought,

00:15:29.600 --> 00:15:32.480
 we haven't really had a battle royale quiz for quite a while.

00:15:32.480 --> 00:15:33.600
 So that was the kernel of it.

00:15:33.600 --> 00:15:34.720
 I do not know that as a genesis.

00:15:34.720 --> 00:15:36.000
 Yeah, that was the backstory.

00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:37.440
 I've played loads and loads of Fortnite,

00:15:37.440 --> 00:15:39.040
 and I've never thought of a TV format, basically.

00:15:39.040 --> 00:15:41.120
 Never thought of a BBC one format, no.

00:15:41.120 --> 00:15:45.120
 I mean, it's quite a long way removed from Fortnite,

00:15:45.120 --> 00:15:47.760
 in that there's hardly any machine guns on the show.

00:15:47.760 --> 00:15:49.680
 But that was, you know,

00:15:49.680 --> 00:15:52.000
 get a big gang of people and one of them's less standing.

00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:54.320
 That was the idea.

00:15:54.320 --> 00:15:56.880
 All right, well, let's get a pop-cultury question.

00:15:56.880 --> 00:16:00.560
 Okay, this one should be in your wheelhouse,

00:16:00.560 --> 00:16:03.840
 which no such thing as a fish guest

00:16:03.840 --> 00:16:06.960
 was employed as Keanu Reeves' stand-in

00:16:06.960 --> 00:16:10.400
 for the 1992 film, Bram Stoker's Dracula.

00:16:10.400 --> 00:16:14.720
 That is brilliant.

00:16:14.720 --> 00:16:15.920
 Who could that be?

00:16:15.920 --> 00:16:17.360
 Goodness, I didn't know this film existed.

00:16:17.360 --> 00:16:18.560
 I didn't know it started Keanu Reeves.

00:16:18.560 --> 00:16:20.960
 I didn't know anything about it.

00:16:20.960 --> 00:16:22.320
 It's a bonkers film.

00:16:22.320 --> 00:16:23.200
 I think you'd enjoy it.

00:16:23.200 --> 00:16:23.840
 It's pretty crackish.

00:16:23.840 --> 00:16:24.640
 It's amazing.

00:16:24.640 --> 00:16:26.400
 A bonus thing about the film is that

00:16:26.400 --> 00:16:30.160
 in the wedding scene between Keanu and Winona Ryder,

00:16:30.160 --> 00:16:32.800
 there's an idea that they're actually married,

00:16:32.800 --> 00:16:36.640
 because of all of the terminology that was said,

00:16:36.640 --> 00:16:37.920
 and the ceremony was proper,

00:16:37.920 --> 00:16:40.880
 they reckon they might have arguably been legally married

00:16:40.880 --> 00:16:42.480
 after the filming of that scene.

00:16:42.480 --> 00:16:44.400
 They both seem to, in interviews,

00:16:44.400 --> 00:16:46.400
 think that that's probably the case,

00:16:46.400 --> 00:16:48.480
 that they are legally married without.

00:16:48.480 --> 00:16:49.360
 Wed.

00:16:49.360 --> 00:16:49.600
 Yeah.

00:16:49.600 --> 00:16:53.360
 So, because I'm a big fan of the movie,

00:16:53.360 --> 00:16:54.880
 I happen to do know the answer to this.

00:16:54.880 --> 00:16:56.720
 Sally Phillips.

00:16:56.720 --> 00:16:58.480
 Sally Phillips was the...

00:16:58.480 --> 00:17:01.760
 Oh, I thought you were going to let us grapple our way to it.

00:17:01.760 --> 00:17:03.600
 Michael Palin was going to be my first guest.

00:17:03.600 --> 00:17:06.320
 I can't believe you've bought it as the correct answer.

00:17:06.320 --> 00:17:09.760
 So quickly, it's obviously not Sally Phillips.

00:17:09.760 --> 00:17:11.440
 Ross, that's a very good point, though,

00:17:11.440 --> 00:17:14.640
 because Anna said Michael Palin.

00:17:14.640 --> 00:17:20.960
 Michael Palin appeared on the 24-hour comic relief thing that we did.

00:17:20.960 --> 00:17:24.960
 Are you sticking purely to the canon of...

00:17:24.960 --> 00:17:27.920
 I'm talking canon, accredited as a guest.

00:17:27.920 --> 00:17:29.040
 Okay, okay.

00:17:29.040 --> 00:17:30.560
 Then we can't go into the sort of thing

00:17:30.560 --> 00:17:33.120
 where we talk about there being a fish canon.

00:17:33.120 --> 00:17:34.160
 It's too...

00:17:34.160 --> 00:17:35.280
 I'm narrowing it down.

00:17:35.280 --> 00:17:36.480
 Okay, I've got...

00:17:36.480 --> 00:17:38.720
 Luckily, I've got our little tour booklet in front of us,

00:17:38.720 --> 00:17:40.240
 and I've got all the names here.

00:17:40.240 --> 00:17:42.720
 You're just going to read them through very quickly.

00:17:42.720 --> 00:17:45.280
 Yeah, you're only allowed three guesses,

00:17:45.280 --> 00:17:47.440
 and I really just want to retract the fact

00:17:47.440 --> 00:17:49.200
 that I ever believed that Sally Phillips

00:17:49.200 --> 00:17:50.880
 was going to be a stand-in for Keanu Reeves.

00:17:50.880 --> 00:17:52.480
 She's got the range.

00:17:52.480 --> 00:17:53.600
 I've got her in the heat of the moment,

00:17:53.600 --> 00:17:55.440
 but I do think she's a great actress.

00:17:55.440 --> 00:17:56.640
 When you say stand-in,

00:17:56.640 --> 00:17:58.000
 it might mean anything that...

00:17:58.000 --> 00:17:59.760
 You know, stand-in might be,

00:17:59.760 --> 00:18:01.760
 "Oh, we just need you to block this shot while we're filming it."

00:18:01.760 --> 00:18:04.400
 That's pretty much what it was, kind of like lighting.

00:18:04.400 --> 00:18:05.440
 There's an age thing here,

00:18:05.440 --> 00:18:06.720
 because obviously, you know,

00:18:06.720 --> 00:18:08.960
 Sarah Pascoe would have been five years old,

00:18:08.960 --> 00:18:10.160
 so it's probably not her.

00:18:10.160 --> 00:18:13.120
 So anyone who was knocking around in 1992...

00:18:13.120 --> 00:18:16.480
 I'm going to lock in my three without you

00:18:16.480 --> 00:18:18.480
 saying whether or not it's right, okay?

00:18:18.480 --> 00:18:19.680
 I've read you Sally Phillips.

00:18:19.680 --> 00:18:24.960
 So then I'm going to say Johnny Knoxville,

00:18:24.960 --> 00:18:27.760
 and then I'm going to say Tim Peake, the astronaut.

00:18:27.760 --> 00:18:29.600
 What are the older guests that we had?

00:18:29.600 --> 00:18:30.480
 We're quite a youth centre.

00:18:30.480 --> 00:18:32.400
 I think you've got a slightly American, don't you?

00:18:32.400 --> 00:18:33.120
 So we've had...

00:18:33.120 --> 00:18:34.080
 Go on, Andy.

00:18:34.080 --> 00:18:36.400
 Someone who travels, right?

00:18:36.400 --> 00:18:40.080
 Someone who is in the only lost episode

00:18:40.080 --> 00:18:41.360
 of No Such Things as a Fish,

00:18:41.360 --> 00:18:46.480
 Victorian explorer, Colonel John Blashford Snell,

00:18:46.480 --> 00:18:47.920
 who discovered a new kind of elephant.

00:18:47.920 --> 00:18:53.440
 I bet he was in LA hunting for some kind of rare orchid

00:18:53.440 --> 00:18:56.160
 at the time, and he just stumbled onto the set.

00:18:56.160 --> 00:18:56.960
 That's my bet.

00:18:56.960 --> 00:18:58.240
 That's a good bet.

00:18:58.240 --> 00:18:59.040
 Could it be...

00:18:59.040 --> 00:19:01.360
 Okay, we're looking at people who were...

00:19:03.200 --> 00:19:06.320
 If they're stunt-doubling, you've got to be sort of the height

00:19:06.320 --> 00:19:08.400
 of the person as well, right?

00:19:08.400 --> 00:19:09.360
 He's 4'9".

00:19:09.360 --> 00:19:10.640
 He's 4'9", Sandy Toxic.

00:19:10.640 --> 00:19:13.760
 Well, I was going to say Stephen,

00:19:13.760 --> 00:19:16.080
 because Stephen obviously has a career in America.

00:19:16.080 --> 00:19:18.640
 However, the height difference would be quite insane.

00:19:18.640 --> 00:19:20.480
 I think you've smashed your quota here, Dan.

00:19:20.480 --> 00:19:24.960
 I think you might have to rein us in and narrow it down a bit.

00:19:24.960 --> 00:19:28.080
 It was actually the first legit guest which was made,

00:19:28.080 --> 00:19:29.120
 which was Johnny Knoxville.

00:19:29.120 --> 00:19:31.760
 Three Jackass Johnny Knoxville.

00:19:31.760 --> 00:19:32.560
 Nice.

00:19:32.560 --> 00:19:34.720
 I assumed it had to be because of the nature

00:19:34.720 --> 00:19:36.080
 of what he does as a job.

00:19:36.080 --> 00:19:38.000
 It makes sense, I feel.

00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:40.160
 But I would recommend the film.

00:19:40.160 --> 00:19:41.840
 It is truly crackers.

00:19:41.840 --> 00:19:45.040
 What's amazing is for Andy particularly,

00:19:45.040 --> 00:19:49.520
 Andy has mowed through the majority of Tom Cruise movies.

00:19:49.520 --> 00:19:51.520
 Sure, mostly just Mission Impossible,

00:19:51.520 --> 00:19:54.160
 but he's in the movie, Andy, as a leader.

00:19:54.160 --> 00:19:55.680
 Oh, I've seen the poster for this.

00:19:55.680 --> 00:19:56.720
 I'd watch it.

00:19:56.720 --> 00:20:01.920
 I'm not so strong on 80s and early 90s Tom Cruise,

00:20:01.920 --> 00:20:03.360
 but I hope it's been gone.

00:20:03.360 --> 00:20:05.680
 Are you thinking of interview with the vampire, Dan?

00:20:05.680 --> 00:20:06.640
 Oh, wait, what did you say?

00:20:06.640 --> 00:20:09.120
 No, Bram Stoker's Dracula.

00:20:09.120 --> 00:20:10.400
 Oh, Bram Stoker.

00:20:10.400 --> 00:20:13.440
 Oh, I was thinking of the wrong movie altogether.

00:20:13.440 --> 00:20:16.800
 Bram Stoker's Dracula is a very different film.

00:20:16.800 --> 00:20:19.280
 It's fantastic.

00:20:19.280 --> 00:20:19.760
 I love it.

00:20:19.760 --> 00:20:21.040
 I wish we could have asked Johnny about it

00:20:21.040 --> 00:20:22.160
 when he'd come on.

00:20:22.160 --> 00:20:24.480
 Can we get James' third fact, then?

00:20:24.480 --> 00:20:27.120
 Okay, so this is my most ridiculous fact.

00:20:27.120 --> 00:20:29.040
 Okay, very ridiculous.

00:20:29.760 --> 00:20:33.120
 But I think that Anna and Andy will really enjoy it.

00:20:33.120 --> 00:20:34.560
 Dan, we'll find out.

00:20:34.560 --> 00:20:41.600
 Okay, up until 2018, who was the literary agent

00:20:41.600 --> 00:20:44.480
 of Fight Club author Chuck Palanoik?

00:20:44.480 --> 00:20:48.000
 Okay, okay.

00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:49.840
 So we've basically got to do 20 questions here.

00:20:49.840 --> 00:20:52.880
 This person has never been on no such thing as a fish,

00:20:52.880 --> 00:20:55.440
 but I think they'd probably make a sensational guest.

00:20:55.440 --> 00:20:57.760
 I have an early guess.

00:20:57.760 --> 00:21:00.800
 Okay, if you're right, this is going to be incredible.

00:21:00.800 --> 00:21:02.000
 How's his sign name pronounced?

00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:05.360
 So Chuck Palanoik, who wrote Fight Club,

00:21:05.360 --> 00:21:07.840
 I don't know if that's how it's pronounced.

00:21:07.840 --> 00:21:09.200
 That's how it's spelled.

00:21:09.200 --> 00:21:12.400
 I reckon he was his own literary agent under a pseudonym.

00:21:12.400 --> 00:21:16.800
 Because Fight Club is all about these mistaken identities

00:21:16.800 --> 00:21:18.560
 and people assume personas.

00:21:18.560 --> 00:21:20.480
 Because that would be great.

00:21:20.480 --> 00:21:21.680
 I'll just go and get him.

00:21:21.680 --> 00:21:24.000
 He says he won't get out of bed for less than a hundred grand.

00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:24.560
 That kind of stuff.

00:21:24.560 --> 00:21:26.560
 But he'd do a different voice for the second one.

00:21:27.520 --> 00:21:29.680
 Here's the thing, though.

00:21:29.680 --> 00:21:31.200
 It's okay.

00:21:31.200 --> 00:21:35.360
 So it is someone who is of interest in theory, not to me.

00:21:35.360 --> 00:21:38.240
 Well, you're an unknown quantity.

00:21:38.240 --> 00:21:40.000
 I'm an unknown quantity, okay.

00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:42.160
 So Hodgman, as you say, it's not a guess,

00:21:42.160 --> 00:21:45.040
 but Hodgman did the pivot from being literary agent,

00:21:45.040 --> 00:21:48.480
 going over to being a writer himself.

00:21:48.480 --> 00:21:51.040
 So it's quite possible that that's the same thing here.

00:21:51.040 --> 00:21:53.520
 We've got a big name in the world of writing

00:21:53.520 --> 00:21:56.160
 who's pivoted away from that world.

00:21:56.160 --> 00:21:57.920
 So is it an author?

00:21:57.920 --> 00:22:00.160
 We can toss in a bit of 20 questions here, right?

00:22:00.160 --> 00:22:01.840
 Is it someone who's an author now?

00:22:01.840 --> 00:22:02.800
 It's not someone who's an author,

00:22:02.800 --> 00:22:06.720
 but it is someone who has two, I would say, unexpected jobs.

00:22:06.720 --> 00:22:09.360
 So they're a literary agent on one hand,

00:22:09.360 --> 00:22:12.640
 and then they do something, I think, entirely different.

00:22:12.640 --> 00:22:12.960
 Okay.

00:22:12.960 --> 00:22:13.840
 That's interesting.

00:22:13.840 --> 00:22:16.160
 Because I've read a thing recently about the basis

00:22:16.160 --> 00:22:17.680
 from the Dandy Warhols.

00:22:17.680 --> 00:22:20.160
 She's now an estate agent in Portland, Oregon.

00:22:20.160 --> 00:22:22.080
 It's that kind of vibe.

00:22:24.320 --> 00:22:25.440
 I thought she's more proud of.

00:22:25.440 --> 00:22:31.440
 What's so different to a literary agent, a tree surgeon?

00:22:31.440 --> 00:22:33.360
 No, but it's something that you can be famous for.

00:22:33.360 --> 00:22:34.080
 Yeah, no, no.

00:22:34.080 --> 00:22:38.000
 It is a celeb for a given value of celeb.

00:22:38.000 --> 00:22:40.160
 Is it an American or a British person?

00:22:40.160 --> 00:22:41.120
 British person.

00:22:41.120 --> 00:22:41.680
 Okay.

00:22:41.680 --> 00:22:42.640
 Working in America.

00:22:42.640 --> 00:22:44.480
 Working in America.

00:22:44.480 --> 00:22:44.720
 Okay.

00:22:44.720 --> 00:22:45.520
 James Corden.

00:22:45.520 --> 00:22:46.560
 No.

00:22:46.560 --> 00:22:48.320
 Elon Musk?

00:22:48.320 --> 00:22:49.280
 South African.

00:22:49.280 --> 00:22:50.000
 But no.

00:22:50.000 --> 00:22:50.720
 Oh, yeah.

00:22:50.720 --> 00:22:51.600
 Yeah.

00:22:51.600 --> 00:22:52.480
 Is it a TV presenter?

00:22:52.480 --> 00:22:52.960
 What's called a thing?

00:22:53.520 --> 00:23:00.400
 It's a TV something that I enjoy, Anna enjoys, and Andy enjoys.

00:23:00.400 --> 00:23:02.320
 And there's probably not that many TV shows

00:23:02.320 --> 00:23:05.120
 that we all enjoy as a trio.

00:23:05.120 --> 00:23:08.960
 Oh, is it Victoria Coron Mitchell of Only Connect?

00:23:08.960 --> 00:23:09.840
 It's not.

00:23:09.840 --> 00:23:10.640
 Literary agent.

00:23:10.640 --> 00:23:14.320
 I would say it's more ridiculous.

00:23:14.320 --> 00:23:17.440
 Is it a drama that this person's connected to

00:23:17.440 --> 00:23:21.200
 or a panel-ish kind of reality show?

00:23:21.200 --> 00:23:22.080
 It's scripted.

00:23:22.080 --> 00:23:22.720
 It's comedy.

00:23:22.720 --> 00:23:23.200
 Scripted.

00:23:23.200 --> 00:23:24.240
 And American or British?

00:23:24.240 --> 00:23:26.400
 American comedy.

00:23:26.400 --> 00:23:26.960
 Frasier.

00:23:26.960 --> 00:23:29.360
 Frasier is correct.

00:23:29.360 --> 00:23:31.040
 Someone British in Frasier.

00:23:31.040 --> 00:23:34.800
 Not Jane Thing, because she was American doing an accent.

00:23:34.800 --> 00:23:35.520
 No, no, she was.

00:23:35.520 --> 00:23:36.960
 She was British, but it's not Jane Leeds.

00:23:36.960 --> 00:23:38.080
 Yeah, she was from Manchester.

00:23:38.080 --> 00:23:38.880
 Okay.

00:23:38.880 --> 00:23:39.920
 I'm out.

00:23:39.920 --> 00:23:42.080
 And your answer is, yeah, I don't watch Frasier.

00:23:42.080 --> 00:23:44.560
 Oh, the agent.

00:23:44.560 --> 00:23:46.400
 The woman who plays as agent, Bebe.

00:23:46.400 --> 00:23:48.000
 It's not Bebe Glazer.

00:23:48.000 --> 00:23:48.560
 Damn it.

00:23:48.560 --> 00:23:49.920
 But it's that kind of tier.

00:23:49.920 --> 00:23:51.840
 Gil Chesterton.

00:23:51.840 --> 00:23:52.960
 It's Gil Chesterton.

00:23:52.960 --> 00:23:55.280
 That's incredible.

00:23:55.280 --> 00:23:58.080
 He negotiated the film rights to Fight Club.

00:23:58.080 --> 00:23:59.200
 Get out.

00:23:59.200 --> 00:24:01.760
 Who's Gil Chesterton?

00:24:01.760 --> 00:24:03.520
 He's the food critic.

00:24:03.520 --> 00:24:06.960
 He does the sort of snobby restaurant review show

00:24:06.960 --> 00:24:09.120
 after Frasier when his show ends.

00:24:09.120 --> 00:24:12.080
 Gil's always coming in with his bow tie and his prissy manners.

00:24:12.080 --> 00:24:19.200
 If Niles is the character that makes Frasier seem grounded and normal,

00:24:19.200 --> 00:24:21.760
 Gil would be the character that makes Niles seem.

00:24:21.760 --> 00:24:25.920
 He's sort of like that pompousness to the nth degree.

00:24:25.920 --> 00:24:27.520
 That is incredible.

00:24:27.520 --> 00:24:29.520
 And he occasionally pops up in other stuff that actor.

00:24:29.520 --> 00:24:31.040
 And it's always a pleasure to see him.

00:24:31.040 --> 00:24:33.280
 He turned up in search party and I just loved seeing him.

00:24:33.280 --> 00:24:35.760
 So he was a real literary agent.

00:24:35.760 --> 00:24:36.240
 And hold on.

00:24:36.240 --> 00:24:38.560
 Gil Chesterton, what's his name on the show?

00:24:38.560 --> 00:24:39.040
 His name?

00:24:39.040 --> 00:24:40.080
 Yeah, what's his name?

00:24:40.080 --> 00:24:42.080
 Edward Hibbet is the name of the actor.

00:24:42.080 --> 00:24:43.200
 Edward Hibbet.

00:24:43.200 --> 00:24:44.880
 Actor and literary agent.

00:24:44.880 --> 00:24:46.080
 Amazing.

00:24:46.080 --> 00:24:46.720
 Amazing.

00:24:46.720 --> 00:24:48.960
 Imagine him turning up and being in your corner.

00:24:48.960 --> 00:24:50.240
 We're in negotiation.

00:24:50.240 --> 00:24:51.200
 You just roll over.

00:24:51.200 --> 00:24:51.920
 That's so good.

00:24:51.920 --> 00:24:52.640
 I wonder.

00:24:52.640 --> 00:24:53.760
 Rawson, what a fact.

00:24:53.760 --> 00:24:56.080
 You've saved the best to last ambassador.

00:24:56.080 --> 00:24:57.200
 Quite specific.

00:24:57.200 --> 00:24:59.280
 Yeah, true.

00:24:59.280 --> 00:25:00.480
 Very specific.

00:25:00.480 --> 00:25:02.800
 Another reason it wasn't my main factor is there was some sort of

00:25:02.800 --> 00:25:06.400
 embezzlement scandal with the company that he worked for,

00:25:06.400 --> 00:25:09.600
 which is why I think Chuck is no longer represented by them.

00:25:09.600 --> 00:25:13.040
 But you know, I'm sure it will come out in the wash.

00:25:13.040 --> 00:25:13.920
 Fantastic.

00:25:13.920 --> 00:25:17.600
 One bonus fact, because it has to do with not necessarily-

00:25:17.600 --> 00:25:19.360
 It's just to do with a minor phrasier character.

00:25:19.360 --> 00:25:20.800
 Otherwise, I am not interested in that.

00:25:20.800 --> 00:25:26.960
 Well, it's to do with the undead, as we were talking about vampires.

00:25:26.960 --> 00:25:29.520
 But the person I mentioned earlier, John Hodgman,

00:25:29.520 --> 00:25:32.240
 the former literary agent,

00:25:32.240 --> 00:25:37.040
 he was the agent to Bruce Campbell, who of evil dead fame,

00:25:37.040 --> 00:25:41.680
 the amazing series, his book, "Leading with My Chin"

00:25:41.680 --> 00:25:43.920
 is a cult classic in that world.

00:25:43.920 --> 00:25:46.320
 And that was Hodgman connected to that.

00:25:46.320 --> 00:25:49.760
 I have to say, you just said so many things that I've never heard of in a row.

00:25:49.760 --> 00:25:50.880
 Cool.

00:25:50.880 --> 00:25:53.360
 You know the entire chat you just had about this girl guy?

00:25:53.360 --> 00:25:55.680
 Ditto, mate.

00:25:55.680 --> 00:25:56.160
 Right.

00:25:56.160 --> 00:25:57.520
 No, it doesn't feel good, does it?

00:25:57.520 --> 00:26:00.640
 Also left out.

00:26:00.640 --> 00:26:02.480
 Well, that was excellent, James.

00:26:02.480 --> 00:26:07.200
 So excited to know those three very, very disparate new facts.

00:26:07.200 --> 00:26:08.400
 All right.

00:26:08.400 --> 00:26:10.640
 Thank you so much to James Rawson.

00:26:10.640 --> 00:26:15.680
 You can get back to being founder of QI and head of all departments.

00:26:15.680 --> 00:26:17.520
 And we all get back to our day jobs.

00:26:17.520 --> 00:26:20.000
 And we'll see you guys in another couple of weeks

00:26:20.000 --> 00:26:22.000
 for some extra bonus material.

00:26:22.000 --> 00:26:25.200
 And of course, if you want to get in touch with any of us,

00:26:25.200 --> 00:26:27.120
 you can get in touch with James.

00:26:27.120 --> 00:26:28.560
 How can they get in touch with you?

00:26:28.560 --> 00:26:31.360
 I mean, Twitter's such a hell sight now.

00:26:31.360 --> 00:26:33.760
 They don't have to.

00:26:33.760 --> 00:26:37.280
 Look, if you don't want anyone to get in touch with you, just don't.

00:26:37.280 --> 00:26:38.080
 Why don't they go...

00:26:38.080 --> 00:26:40.720
 Why don't they, if they love awesome 90s music,

00:26:40.720 --> 00:26:42.160
 go to one of James's nights?

00:26:42.160 --> 00:26:43.840
 So they still happening at the moment, James?

00:26:43.840 --> 00:26:47.680
 Yeah, come to push the button the last Friday of every month

00:26:47.680 --> 00:26:50.560
 at the Royal Voxel Tavern in London.

00:26:50.560 --> 00:26:51.920
 Come to the DJ booth.

00:26:51.920 --> 00:26:53.360
 We don't take requests.

00:26:53.360 --> 00:26:54.560
 We will take compliments.

00:26:54.560 --> 00:26:56.000
 There you go.

00:26:56.000 --> 00:26:56.800
 Push the button.

00:26:56.800 --> 00:26:58.560
 That's where to find him.

00:26:58.560 --> 00:26:59.600
 Dan, where do they find you?

00:26:59.600 --> 00:27:01.360
 Shriverland.

00:27:01.360 --> 00:27:02.000
 Cool.

00:27:02.000 --> 00:27:02.880
 And Andy?

00:27:02.880 --> 00:27:06.240
 You just didn't say like where there was no at.

00:27:06.240 --> 00:27:09.920
 This like just goes to this mystical, real universe.

00:27:09.920 --> 00:27:11.680
 It's ephemeral.

00:27:11.680 --> 00:27:14.320
 It's a state of mind, Shriverland.

00:27:14.320 --> 00:27:15.920
 Yeah, it's a frightening place to be.

00:27:15.920 --> 00:27:16.880
 Andy, sorry, where are you?

00:27:16.880 --> 00:27:18.800
 @andyhunterm.

00:27:18.800 --> 00:27:19.440
 Great.

00:27:19.440 --> 00:27:24.400
 And you can also, of course, email podcast at qi.com

00:27:24.400 --> 00:27:29.120

00:27:29.120 --> 00:27:31.760

 We'll see you again very soon.

00:27:42.080 --> 00:27:42.880

 Bye.
