00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:21,120
 Hello everybody! Hi there! Welcome to your latest installment of Meet the Elf.

3
00:00:21,120 --> 00:00:25,280
 Or Meet the Elves. That's what James called it but I call it Meet the Elf because there's one

4
00:00:25,280 --> 00:00:32,960
 elf to meet and this week it is James Rawson. Hi James! Hi Anna, hi Andy, hi Dan, hey!

5
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:40,000
 We're here as well. We are here! Yes and I'm also joined by Andy and Dan as usual

6
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:47,440
 and I'm Anna. And James is probably the longest serving elf as I from us I reckon now.

7
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:53,440
 Alex Bell might not like you saying that but I'll go along with it. I'd never count him.

8
00:00:54,000 --> 00:01:00,480
 Yeah. You are the creative head of development, is that correct?

9
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:02,880
 No, no, no. Again so many people won't like what you're saying.

10
00:01:02,880 --> 00:01:07,760
 This is so exciting! I'm actually the managing director.

11
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:11,120
 What was it like when you founded and thought of the idea for QI all those years ago?

12
00:01:11,120 --> 00:01:14,720
 Are you the Blackadder producer as well? Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

13
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:19,600
 Why don't we, as part of the show, why don't we ask the elf to tell us

14
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:22,640
 some things about themselves rather than assuming all the incorrect information?

15
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:28,960
 And you have bright blonde hair, don't you? And actually you've got five testicles.

16
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:32,320
 My underpants feel like a glove.

17
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:37,440
 Yes, James, sorry, tell us what you do at QI.

18
00:01:37,440 --> 00:01:43,200
 Okay, so I'm head of digital which is all social channels. I'm also a development producer which

19
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:49,600
 means trying to come up with new TV shows. Occasionally I'll edit a book, I'll do a radio,

20
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:53,520
 two-spot, you know, we all wear many hats and those are some of mine.

21
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:58,320
 And I knew that, James. I knew all of that as well. I don't know why we allowed Anna the Reigns here.

22
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:03,760
 I don't really know all the terminology and development producer to me is the same as head

23
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:10,400
 of, you produce the development, but I understand that that might ruffle some feathers, so let's

24
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:14,960
 move on. You have brought with you today a fact, is that correct?

25
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:23,200
 I brought a question, Anna. Do you feel like any moment you're going to wake up and this will

26
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:28,800
 all have been a horrible dream? It may seem like a dream because you are naked right now,

27
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:36,080
 but I assume that's the choice you made. I thought we all agreed that. I think I'm getting it right

28
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:41,360
 and you guys are getting it wrong, so I am just going to keep plowing on. You've brought a question

29
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:49,440
 to which the answer is going to be a fact. Correct. Okay, fine. I'll take it. So without further ado,

30
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:52,480
 I would say we should get on with you asking us this question,

31
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:57,200
 us grappling our way to the answer for it. Yeah, everyone agree? Oh yeah, agreed.

32
00:02:57,200 --> 00:03:03,920
 Great. What's your question, James? Tornus nuclear power plant in Scotland was attacked in 2011

33
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:10,560
 and forced to temporarily shut down. Similar attacks have taken place on power plants in Israel,

34
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:17,760
 Japan, the United States, the Philippines, South Korea, India and Sweden. Going back as far as

35
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:27,600
 1937. What is the story behind these attacks? Oh, I was so hoping for a pop culture question this

36
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:34,080
 time. No, I've gone for counter programming. Rolson for people who've not yet met him is probably

37
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:41,760
 got more knowledge about the world of pop music, particularly, I would say late 90s, early 2000s

38
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:48,880
 girl bands. That seems to be in your pocket. So that's what I was really hoping for. Well, Dan,

39
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:54,240
 we haven't ruled that out yet. It might be that. It could be the Saturdays. Oh, yes. Yes.

40
00:03:54,240 --> 00:04:01,760
 Oh, where all these power plants be witched? The first CD single I ever bought was by be witch.

41
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:05,760
 Really? Was it Sailor V or one of their more difficult follow up singles?

42
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:14,880
 It was Sailor V. Rather than the minimalist Zen funk, they started pumping out my school guitar

43
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:20,320
 teacher who taught me my first lessons wrote one of the B-sides for the for a bewitched album.

44
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:26,080
 Wow. Yeah, well, not the album, the B-side. Yeah. So that's huge. Thanks for bringing bewitched to

45
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:30,320
 the table here, James. No, absolutely. They're back, right? They're back. Are they?

46
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:34,320
 Yeah, no, they had an IP out. Sorry, you might hear my two hour barking in the background.

47
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:40,240
 She's also a guest on today's show. So yeah, be witched do have an EP out this year.

48
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:44,480
 That's what I can confirm. That is not my fact. Because your fact was about power plants being

49
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:48,560
 attacked. And you said nuclear plants, didn't you? The first one was a Scottish nuclear plant.

50
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:55,280
 Okay, so it has happened to a variety of power plants, including coal plants. But recently,

51
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:59,280
 it's been happening more with nuclear power plants, but could happen to any power plant.

52
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:04,480
 The first nuclear plant didn't open in the UK until I think about the mid 50s or 1960.

53
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:06,640
 But the very exciting thing was that was opened by the Queen.

54
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:15,040
 So the 1937 attack was on a coal plant in Australia, if that helps?

55
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:20,480
 I found out the other day, and I actually then found out that we'd run it on QI, but I was

56
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:25,120
 unaware of that. But you know, Colesden Newcastle, they're saying, you know, it's like bringing

57
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:31,200
 Colesden Newcastle. Yeah, that still can be said. You say, you know, the idea is obviously

58
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:34,960
 that Newcastle is such a huge coal producer, it'd be stupid to bring Coles there.

59
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:38,000
 What do you know that Newcastle is still the biggest coal producer in the world?

60
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:44,960
 Is that Cheryl Cole? Hey, nice. Not the audience for my Cheryl Cole gags, is it?

61
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:47,440
 What do you mean Newcastle the biggest coal producer? No, it's not.

62
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:52,800
 It is Andy. It is. What, what can I mean? Sorry. Newcastle, Newcastle, Australia?

63
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:57,040
 Yeah, I think that's so cool. Oh, nice. That is cool, yeah.

64
00:05:57,040 --> 00:06:01,840
 Anyway, sorry, going back to this cryptic question. No, can I distract, can I distract

65
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:05,760
 with one more thing? You know, isn't Gateshead just next to Newcastle?

66
00:06:05,760 --> 00:06:10,480
 In the UK it is, yeah. In the UK it is, yeah. And that is one of my favourite facts, is that

67
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:14,480
 there's a slang term called getting off at Gateshead, which is the rude one.

68
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:18,800
 I know that. I know the Liverpool version, which is getting off at more fields, I think,

69
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:23,680
 before Lime Street. It's to disembark from your mode of transport before it reaches

70
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:27,920
 the terminal point, and it means having coitus, interruptus, sex.

71
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:34,400
 I think we would have got it without you even having to explain what it meant after you said

72
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:39,200
 the metaphorical thing. Cool. That's good. So are we doing facts now that have to make

73
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:43,200
 their word geographically around the UK from Newcastle to Pasta?

74
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:47,280
 Well, I've got another, Liz Truss's nickname is Dagonant because she's three stops beyond

75
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:49,360
 barking, which is... Nice.

76
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:53,040
 Sorry, I found that out yesterday. That's very good.

77
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:55,360
 Right, power plants. Power plants.

78
00:06:55,360 --> 00:07:00,880
 Is it, can I just say, I think it's very brave of you to do a fact which has the threat of

79
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:05,600
 nuclear disaster lingering in the background in a week where Iran, a nuclear power, has

80
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:11,440
 just decided to evolve itself in a war zone. Well done, brave.

81
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:12,560
 Thank you for keeping it light, Anna.

82
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:17,360
 I think it's important sometimes to... I think if you're listening to this in the aftertimes

83
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:22,160
 and you send in the correct answer now, you get an extra ration of millet.

84
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:28,240
 Fine, let's get back to some pop groups, shall we?

85
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:30,960
 Is it birds?

86
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:33,040
 It's not birds. Oh, that's birds.

87
00:07:33,040 --> 00:07:36,080
 Okay, because they sometimes attack power lines, don't they, and bring things down.

88
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:36,640
 It's a good guess.

89
00:07:36,640 --> 00:07:40,400
 Sorry, are we talking, sorry, was it power lines, not power stations?

90
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:43,600
 It's power plants specifically. It's the stations.

91
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:45,760
 So what can bring down a station?

92
00:07:45,760 --> 00:07:47,360
 And they're all over the world as well.

93
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:50,560
 So it feels like it's a natural phenomenon rather than...

94
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:53,120
 Humans are all over the world too famously.

95
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:56,720
 How did, well, how did the power plant get there without said humans?

96
00:07:56,720 --> 00:08:04,320
 Is it they've all suffered a malfunction and by incredible coincidence,

97
00:08:04,320 --> 00:08:06,800
 the human behind it has always been named Homer?

98
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:07,520
 No, it's good.

99
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:08,880
 No, good guess, but no.

100
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:09,360
 It is good.

101
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:17,760
 So of all the guesses so far, Anna's is probably the closest with birds, although not birds.

102
00:08:17,760 --> 00:08:18,080
 Bees.

103
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:20,960
 Not bees either.

104
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:22,560
 It's something natural though, isn't it?

105
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:23,040
 Yeah.

106
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:26,960
 It's quite good, the idea of a sinister organization devoted to, you know,

107
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:31,520
 cancelling people's electricity, which has been operating since the 1930s.

108
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:35,200
 Like that's a cool premise for a Bond film or something, but the baddies are...

109
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:36,480
 Or a dystopian novel.

110
00:08:36,480 --> 00:08:38,720
 It's got to be something simpler.

111
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:41,760
 Like, you know those, I don't know what those flowers are called,

112
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:45,680
 but you pick up that have all the white bits sticking out that you blow and they fly away.

113
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:47,840
 Dandelions.

114
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:49,040
 Dandelions.

115
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:50,080
 They're very obscure.

116
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:52,480
 Dan, that is a, that's a root one flower.

117
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:53,280
 I know them.

118
00:08:53,280 --> 00:08:54,560
 I just couldn't remember the name.

119
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:55,840
 It's got my name in it as well.

120
00:08:55,840 --> 00:08:59,120
 That should be a very close one to me.

121
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:07,920
 Is it dandelion carried in the breeze that is sort of clogging some sort of a bit of the system?

122
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:10,880
 So the word that you've got there is clogging.

123
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:11,680
 Yeah.

124
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:14,080
 Stick with clogging.

125
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:15,520
 Something natural that clogs.

126
00:09:15,520 --> 00:09:19,520
 Some mud or dust, silt.

127
00:09:19,520 --> 00:09:21,040
 Is it related to water?

128
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:22,560
 It is related to water.

129
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:27,200
 Is it something to do with like a big shoal of some kind of fish

130
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:31,680
 that sometimes gets in the way of, because of the power?

131
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:34,160
 Power stations all have water inlets.

132
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:35,360
 They're basically big kettles.

133
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:38,000
 No matter what the power they're using, whether it's nuclear or coal or whatever,

134
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,480
 they basically heat water into steam, turns into a termite.

135
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:41,680
 So they need to be near rivers.

136
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:42,320
 Obviously.

137
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:43,440
 Yeah, okay.

138
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:46,240
 I do have a cool power fact for you just to digress.

139
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:48,160
 And it was on the show I wanted to mention at 80s ago,

140
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:51,840
 because I read that book Power Up about renewable energy and all of that.

141
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:54,080
 And it was about, you know, liquid natural gas.

142
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:56,400
 So if you cool it down to minus 200 degrees,

143
00:09:56,400 --> 00:09:59,600
 it turns into a liquid and you can then put it under high pressure

144
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:01,840
 into ships and transport it around the world, right?

145
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:04,480
 Okay, I didn't know that, but yes.

146
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:08,000
 Okay, so like when Russia invaded Ukraine and all the gas was turned off coming from there,

147
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:11,520
 we had to turn to American gas, which has to be put on liquid natural gas ships.

148
00:10:11,520 --> 00:10:14,960
 They've got these huge domes on to transport the gas at minus,

149
00:10:14,960 --> 00:10:16,880
 you know, incredibly low temperatures.

150
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:18,320
 So it stays liquid, right?

151
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:19,280
 That's amazing.

152
00:10:19,280 --> 00:10:21,760
 You turn the gas into a liquid to transport it and then...

153
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:22,640
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

154
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:23,680
 It's very, very cool.

155
00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:27,280
 Well, I think it might still be liquid at the point of burning, actually.

156
00:10:27,280 --> 00:10:32,560
 Anyway, but the first ship ever built to transport that stuff

157
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:36,000
 was, I think, in the late 40s, and it was called the Methane Princess.

158
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,360
 Ooh, lovely.

159
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:38,560
 What a great name for a ship.

160
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:41,680
 That actually used to be Queen Elizabeth's nickname.

161
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:44,960
 Yeah, that's brilliant.

162
00:10:44,960 --> 00:10:45,840
 So is that it, Rawson?

163
00:10:45,840 --> 00:10:48,560
 Is water somehow getting gummed up?

164
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:52,240
 Well, Anna said some type of fish.

165
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:56,240
 And actually, interestingly, you could debate whether or not this is a type of fish.

166
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:56,960
 Jelly?

167
00:10:56,960 --> 00:10:58,000
 With the cabbage?

168
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,040
 Jellyfish, indeed.

169
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:00,800
 Oh, wow.

170
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:03,120
 Because they're so gummy.

171
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:04,560
 Yeah, so they're so gummy.

172
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:06,240
 So there's quite a few factors at play here.

173
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:11,760
 Obviously, as discussed, power plants have to be by large bodies of water,

174
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:17,200
 which all gets filtered through to cool down the power plants to get very hot.

175
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:22,480
 But they all have systems in place to filter out aquatic life,

176
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:27,920
 but the sheer volume of a jellyfish bloom just completely overwhelms the system,

177
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:32,320
 and they can have to shut down for sort of a day, two days, which costs millions of pounds.

178
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:36,240
 But it's getting worse, and they're happening more frequently,

179
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:40,560
 because as the waters heat up, jellyfish love that.

180
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:43,920
 And as the waters get more acidic, jellyfish like that, too.

181
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:47,120
 So we're getting bigger and bigger and bigger jellyfish blooms,

182
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:49,920
 which are creating more and more problems for nuclear power plants.

183
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:53,200
 So it's happening more and more often.

184
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:53,600
 Amazing.

185
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:54,000
 Oh, wow.

186
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,160
 Very interesting.

187
00:11:56,160 --> 00:12:01,600
 Is that ironic that nuclear power plants are possible weapon in the fight against climate change?

188
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:01,600
 Yeah.

189
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:03,840
 Are being stymied?

190
00:12:03,840 --> 00:12:06,880
 Well, the jellyfish like climate change,

191
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:11,680
 so they've obviously got a vested interest in sabotaging renewable power sources.

192
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:13,120
 Of course.

193
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:15,920
 Wow, so when we do completely destroy the planet,

194
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:18,720
 because the oceans are pure acid and boiling hot,

195
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:21,280
 the jellyfish are going to be over the world because they love it.

196
00:12:21,280 --> 00:12:22,880
 Yeah, they've been playing the long game.

197
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:23,680
 That's very cool.

198
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:25,920
 Do we know how we remedy the situation?

199
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:28,400
 Does someone have to go down and clear the jellyfish out?

200
00:12:28,400 --> 00:12:31,520
 So there was one in India where they counted four million jellyfish

201
00:12:31,520 --> 00:12:33,680
 that they had to remove from the systems.

202
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:38,320
 They're looking into drones to sort of monitor jellyfish blooms,

203
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:40,400
 so they can get a bit of a head's up.

204
00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:44,160
 And also acoustic systems whereby they can listen out,

205
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:45,520
 not sure what noise the jellyfish makes,

206
00:12:45,520 --> 00:12:48,560
 listen out for large groups of jellyfish.

207
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:52,720
 But obviously it's a real problem if you should down a power plant for 24 hours.

208
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:53,360
 That's...

209
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:53,760
 Yeah.

210
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:56,400
 The Suffolk nuclear plants, what are they called?

211
00:12:56,400 --> 00:13:01,520
 Sizewell, they, I think, have fish detectors,

212
00:13:01,520 --> 00:13:03,760
 or they, because they're building a new one at the moment,

213
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:06,240
 I think it's going to include a kind of fish water slide system

214
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:09,280
 where if any fish goes in, it gets filtered out,

215
00:13:09,280 --> 00:13:13,440
 and then goes on a magical journey and then goes pop back out into the sea.

216
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:15,200
 And none of its friends will ever believe it.

217
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:17,360
 I think that's the idea behind what's happening there.

218
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:17,920
 That's very...

219
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:20,960
 So we'll just see fish queuing, flocking and queuing up

220
00:13:20,960 --> 00:13:22,320
 to take the sizewell right.

221
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:24,080
 Sorry, you have to be six inches long to go.

222
00:13:24,080 --> 00:13:30,240
 I don't know how a jellyfish bloom happens.

223
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:34,160
 Is that jellyfish reproducing, or is that them all coming together?

224
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:36,160
 I don't know, it's like a convention, isn't it?

225
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:37,760
 Is it like a comic book thing?

226
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:38,560
 Yeah, I think so.

227
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:38,960
 Okay.

228
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:42,880
 That was such nerds.

229
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:44,000
 Cool.

230
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:47,200
 That's very good.

231
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:49,280
 Well, you have actually brought with you, James,

232
00:13:49,280 --> 00:13:51,920
 some secret follow-up facts, right?

233
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:53,200
 Well, always come prepared.

234
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:55,360
 So I've got a couple of backups.

235
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:57,840
 These are more pop culture geared.

236
00:13:57,840 --> 00:13:58,800
 Yes, here we go.

237
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:00,000
 We'll be glad to know.

238
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:00,880
 Now, here's the thing.

239
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:04,080
 We should just say as well as all the hats that Rawson wears

240
00:14:04,080 --> 00:14:05,520
 as part of his QI world.

241
00:14:05,520 --> 00:14:07,120
 When we say he's in development,

242
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:08,720
 he not only is in development,

243
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:11,600
 but he has done almost what's virtually an impossible thing

244
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:12,320
 in the world of TV.

245
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:15,680
 He's taken an idea and taken it from the page

246
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:16,800
 all the way to the TV.

247
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:19,760
 Because he created the tournament TV show,

248
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:22,480
 which ran for a few series with Alex Scott,

249
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:25,200
 who was the former English footballer.

250
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:26,080
 She was the host.

251
00:14:26,080 --> 00:14:30,480
 It's in your bones, isn't it?

252
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:31,680
 Even before QI,

253
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:34,560
 you were a dude who was on TV shows as a quiz-er.

254
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:36,960
 This is your big love, isn't it?

255
00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:39,120
 Yes, so I've done Countdown.

256
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:41,440
 That was the main show that I did.

257
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:44,960
 I just like formats and pulling them apart

258
00:14:44,960 --> 00:14:46,800
 and destroying them and putting them back together,

259
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:49,920
 which is entirely what I plan to do on your format today.

260
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:52,480
 And yeah, we had the tournament.

261
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:54,320
 We had two series of that on BBC One.

262
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:56,240
 I don't think it's available to stream on iPlayer,

263
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:57,200
 but you know, never mind.

264
00:14:57,200 --> 00:15:00,800
 Find it, find it out there somewhere.

265
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:02,720
 It really was quite a single-handed, wasn't it?

266
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:06,000
 You had this idea, and then it actually happened.

267
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,480
 Yeah, I mean, Dan was in the chat as well,

268
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:09,920
 Anna, Simon or exec.

269
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:12,960
 Sure, so they held it back for a while,

270
00:15:12,960 --> 00:15:16,480
 but eventually you managed to fight them down.

271
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:19,760
 Yeah, I mean, it actually came from playing Fortnite during lockdown,

272
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:21,920
 which is a battle royale game

273
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:24,560
 where a bunch of people get dropped on a computer game island

274
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:26,640
 and get given various weapons,

275
00:15:26,640 --> 00:15:28,640
 and the last one surviving wins.

276
00:15:28,640 --> 00:15:29,600
 And I just thought,

277
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:32,480
 we haven't really had a battle royale quiz for quite a while.

278
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:33,600
 So that was the kernel of it.

279
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:34,720
 I do not know that as a genesis.

280
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:36,000
 Yeah, that was the backstory.

281
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,440
 I've played loads and loads of Fortnite,

282
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:39,040
 and I've never thought of a TV format, basically.

283
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:41,120
 Never thought of a BBC one format, no.

284
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:45,120
 I mean, it's quite a long way removed from Fortnite,

285
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:47,760
 in that there's hardly any machine guns on the show.

286
00:15:47,760 --> 00:15:49,680
 But that was, you know,

287
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:52,000
 get a big gang of people and one of them's less standing.

288
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,320
 That was the idea.

289
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:56,880
 All right, well, let's get a pop-cultury question.

290
00:15:56,880 --> 00:16:00,560
 Okay, this one should be in your wheelhouse,

291
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:03,840
 which no such thing as a fish guest

292
00:16:03,840 --> 00:16:06,960
 was employed as Keanu Reeves' stand-in

293
00:16:06,960 --> 00:16:10,400
 for the 1992 film, Bram Stoker's Dracula.

294
00:16:10,400 --> 00:16:14,720
 That is brilliant.

295
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:15,920
 Who could that be?

296
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:17,360
 Goodness, I didn't know this film existed.

297
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:18,560
 I didn't know it started Keanu Reeves.

298
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:20,960
 I didn't know anything about it.

299
00:16:20,960 --> 00:16:22,320
 It's a bonkers film.

300
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:23,200
 I think you'd enjoy it.

301
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:23,840
 It's pretty crackish.

302
00:16:23,840 --> 00:16:24,640
 It's amazing.

303
00:16:24,640 --> 00:16:26,400
 A bonus thing about the film is that

304
00:16:26,400 --> 00:16:30,160
 in the wedding scene between Keanu and Winona Ryder,

305
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:32,800
 there's an idea that they're actually married,

306
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:36,640
 because of all of the terminology that was said,

307
00:16:36,640 --> 00:16:37,920
 and the ceremony was proper,

308
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:40,880
 they reckon they might have arguably been legally married

309
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:42,480
 after the filming of that scene.

310
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:44,400
 They both seem to, in interviews,

311
00:16:44,400 --> 00:16:46,400
 think that that's probably the case,

312
00:16:46,400 --> 00:16:48,480
 that they are legally married without.

313
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:49,360
 Wed.

314
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:49,600
 Yeah.

315
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:53,360
 So, because I'm a big fan of the movie,

316
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:54,880
 I happen to do know the answer to this.

317
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:56,720
 Sally Phillips.

318
00:16:56,720 --> 00:16:58,480
 Sally Phillips was the...

319
00:16:58,480 --> 00:17:01,760
 Oh, I thought you were going to let us grapple our way to it.

320
00:17:01,760 --> 00:17:03,600
 Michael Palin was going to be my first guest.

321
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:06,320
 I can't believe you've bought it as the correct answer.

322
00:17:06,320 --> 00:17:09,760
 So quickly, it's obviously not Sally Phillips.

323
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:11,440
 Ross, that's a very good point, though,

324
00:17:11,440 --> 00:17:14,640
 because Anna said Michael Palin.

325
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:20,960
 Michael Palin appeared on the 24-hour comic relief thing that we did.

326
00:17:20,960 --> 00:17:24,960
 Are you sticking purely to the canon of...

327
00:17:24,960 --> 00:17:27,920
 I'm talking canon, accredited as a guest.

328
00:17:27,920 --> 00:17:29,040
 Okay, okay.

329
00:17:29,040 --> 00:17:30,560
 Then we can't go into the sort of thing

330
00:17:30,560 --> 00:17:33,120
 where we talk about there being a fish canon.

331
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:34,160
 It's too...

332
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:35,280
 I'm narrowing it down.

333
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:36,480
 Okay, I've got...

334
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:38,720
 Luckily, I've got our little tour booklet in front of us,

335
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:40,240
 and I've got all the names here.

336
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:42,720
 You're just going to read them through very quickly.

337
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:45,280
 Yeah, you're only allowed three guesses,

338
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:47,440
 and I really just want to retract the fact

339
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:49,200
 that I ever believed that Sally Phillips

340
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:50,880
 was going to be a stand-in for Keanu Reeves.

341
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:52,480
 She's got the range.

342
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:53,600
 I've got her in the heat of the moment,

343
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:55,440
 but I do think she's a great actress.

344
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:56,640
 When you say stand-in,

345
00:17:56,640 --> 00:17:58,000
 it might mean anything that...

346
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,760
 You know, stand-in might be,

347
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:01,760
 "Oh, we just need you to block this shot while we're filming it."

348
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:04,400
 That's pretty much what it was, kind of like lighting.

349
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:05,440
 There's an age thing here,

350
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:06,720
 because obviously, you know,

351
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:08,960
 Sarah Pascoe would have been five years old,

352
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:10,160
 so it's probably not her.

353
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:13,120
 So anyone who was knocking around in 1992...

354
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:16,480
 I'm going to lock in my three without you

355
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:18,480
 saying whether or not it's right, okay?

356
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:19,680
 I've read you Sally Phillips.

357
00:18:19,680 --> 00:18:24,960
 So then I'm going to say Johnny Knoxville,

358
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:27,760
 and then I'm going to say Tim Peake, the astronaut.

359
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:29,600
 What are the older guests that we had?

360
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:30,480
 We're quite a youth centre.

361
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:32,400
 I think you've got a slightly American, don't you?

362
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:33,120
 So we've had...

363
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:34,080
 Go on, Andy.

364
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:36,400
 Someone who travels, right?

365
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:40,080
 Someone who is in the only lost episode

366
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:41,360
 of No Such Things as a Fish,

367
00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:46,480
 Victorian explorer, Colonel John Blashford Snell,

368
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:47,920
 who discovered a new kind of elephant.

369
00:18:47,920 --> 00:18:53,440
 I bet he was in LA hunting for some kind of rare orchid

370
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:56,160
 at the time, and he just stumbled onto the set.

371
00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:56,960
 That's my bet.

372
00:18:56,960 --> 00:18:58,240
 That's a good bet.

373
00:18:58,240 --> 00:18:59,040
 Could it be...

374
00:18:59,040 --> 00:19:01,360
 Okay, we're looking at people who were...

375
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:06,320
 If they're stunt-doubling, you've got to be sort of the height

376
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:08,400
 of the person as well, right?

377
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:09,360
 He's 4'9".

378
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:10,640
 He's 4'9", Sandy Toxic.

379
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:13,760
 Well, I was going to say Stephen,

380
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:16,080
 because Stephen obviously has a career in America.

381
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:18,640
 However, the height difference would be quite insane.

382
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:20,480
 I think you've smashed your quota here, Dan.

383
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:24,960
 I think you might have to rein us in and narrow it down a bit.

384
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:28,080
 It was actually the first legit guest which was made,

385
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:29,120
 which was Johnny Knoxville.

386
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:31,760
 Three Jackass Johnny Knoxville.

387
00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:32,560
 Nice.

388
00:19:32,560 --> 00:19:34,720
 I assumed it had to be because of the nature

389
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:36,080
 of what he does as a job.

390
00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:38,000
 It makes sense, I feel.

391
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,160
 But I would recommend the film.

392
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:41,840
 It is truly crackers.

393
00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:45,040
 What's amazing is for Andy particularly,

394
00:19:45,040 --> 00:19:49,520
 Andy has mowed through the majority of Tom Cruise movies.

395
00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:51,520
 Sure, mostly just Mission Impossible,

396
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:54,160
 but he's in the movie, Andy, as a leader.

397
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:55,680
 Oh, I've seen the poster for this.

398
00:19:55,680 --> 00:19:56,720
 I'd watch it.

399
00:19:56,720 --> 00:20:01,920
 I'm not so strong on 80s and early 90s Tom Cruise,

400
00:20:01,920 --> 00:20:03,360
 but I hope it's been gone.

401
00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:05,680
 Are you thinking of interview with the vampire, Dan?

402
00:20:05,680 --> 00:20:06,640
 Oh, wait, what did you say?

403
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:09,120
 No, Bram Stoker's Dracula.

404
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:10,400
 Oh, Bram Stoker.

405
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:13,440
 Oh, I was thinking of the wrong movie altogether.

406
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:16,800
 Bram Stoker's Dracula is a very different film.

407
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:19,280
 It's fantastic.

408
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:19,760
 I love it.

409
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:21,040
 I wish we could have asked Johnny about it

410
00:20:21,040 --> 00:20:22,160
 when he'd come on.

411
00:20:22,160 --> 00:20:24,480
 Can we get James' third fact, then?

412
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:27,120
 Okay, so this is my most ridiculous fact.

413
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:29,040
 Okay, very ridiculous.

414
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:33,120
 But I think that Anna and Andy will really enjoy it.

415
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:34,560
 Dan, we'll find out.

416
00:20:34,560 --> 00:20:41,600
 Okay, up until 2018, who was the literary agent

417
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:44,480
 of Fight Club author Chuck Palanoik?

418
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:48,000
 Okay, okay.

419
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:49,840
 So we've basically got to do 20 questions here.

420
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:52,880
 This person has never been on no such thing as a fish,

421
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:55,440
 but I think they'd probably make a sensational guest.

422
00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:57,760
 I have an early guess.

423
00:20:57,760 --> 00:21:00,800
 Okay, if you're right, this is going to be incredible.

424
00:21:00,800 --> 00:21:02,000
 How's his sign name pronounced?

425
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:05,360
 So Chuck Palanoik, who wrote Fight Club,

426
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:07,840
 I don't know if that's how it's pronounced.

427
00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:09,200
 That's how it's spelled.

428
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:12,400
 I reckon he was his own literary agent under a pseudonym.

429
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:16,800
 Because Fight Club is all about these mistaken identities

430
00:21:16,800 --> 00:21:18,560
 and people assume personas.

431
00:21:18,560 --> 00:21:20,480
 Because that would be great.

432
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:21,680
 I'll just go and get him.

433
00:21:21,680 --> 00:21:24,000
 He says he won't get out of bed for less than a hundred grand.

434
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:24,560
 That kind of stuff.

435
00:21:24,560 --> 00:21:26,560
 But he'd do a different voice for the second one.

436
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:29,680
 Here's the thing, though.

437
00:21:29,680 --> 00:21:31,200
 It's okay.

438
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:35,360
 So it is someone who is of interest in theory, not to me.

439
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:38,240
 Well, you're an unknown quantity.

440
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:40,000
 I'm an unknown quantity, okay.

441
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,160
 So Hodgman, as you say, it's not a guess,

442
00:21:42,160 --> 00:21:45,040
 but Hodgman did the pivot from being literary agent,

443
00:21:45,040 --> 00:21:48,480
 going over to being a writer himself.

444
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:51,040
 So it's quite possible that that's the same thing here.

445
00:21:51,040 --> 00:21:53,520
 We've got a big name in the world of writing

446
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:56,160
 who's pivoted away from that world.

447
00:21:56,160 --> 00:21:57,920
 So is it an author?

448
00:21:57,920 --> 00:22:00,160
 We can toss in a bit of 20 questions here, right?

449
00:22:00,160 --> 00:22:01,840
 Is it someone who's an author now?

450
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:02,800
 It's not someone who's an author,

451
00:22:02,800 --> 00:22:06,720
 but it is someone who has two, I would say, unexpected jobs.

452
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:09,360
 So they're a literary agent on one hand,

453
00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:12,640
 and then they do something, I think, entirely different.

454
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:12,960
 Okay.

455
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:13,840
 That's interesting.

456
00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:16,160
 Because I've read a thing recently about the basis

457
00:22:16,160 --> 00:22:17,680
 from the Dandy Warhols.

458
00:22:17,680 --> 00:22:20,160
 She's now an estate agent in Portland, Oregon.

459
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:22,080
 It's that kind of vibe.

460
00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:25,440
 I thought she's more proud of.

461
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:31,440
 What's so different to a literary agent, a tree surgeon?

462
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:33,360
 No, but it's something that you can be famous for.

463
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:34,080
 Yeah, no, no.

464
00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:38,000
 It is a celeb for a given value of celeb.

465
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,160
 Is it an American or a British person?

466
00:22:40,160 --> 00:22:41,120
 British person.

467
00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:41,680
 Okay.

468
00:22:41,680 --> 00:22:42,640
 Working in America.

469
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:44,480
 Working in America.

470
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:44,720
 Okay.

471
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:45,520
 James Corden.

472
00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:46,560
 No.

473
00:22:46,560 --> 00:22:48,320
 Elon Musk?

474
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:49,280
 South African.

475
00:22:49,280 --> 00:22:50,000
 But no.

476
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:50,720
 Oh, yeah.

477
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:51,600
 Yeah.

478
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:52,480
 Is it a TV presenter?

479
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:52,960
 What's called a thing?

480
00:22:53,520 --> 00:23:00,400
 It's a TV something that I enjoy, Anna enjoys, and Andy enjoys.

481
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:02,320
 And there's probably not that many TV shows

482
00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:05,120
 that we all enjoy as a trio.

483
00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:08,960
 Oh, is it Victoria Coron Mitchell of Only Connect?

484
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:09,840
 It's not.

485
00:23:09,840 --> 00:23:10,640
 Literary agent.

486
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:14,320
 I would say it's more ridiculous.

487
00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:17,440
 Is it a drama that this person's connected to

488
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:21,200
 or a panel-ish kind of reality show?

489
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:22,080
 It's scripted.

490
00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:22,720
 It's comedy.

491
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:23,200
 Scripted.

492
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:24,240
 And American or British?

493
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:26,400
 American comedy.

494
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:26,960
 Frasier.

495
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:29,360
 Frasier is correct.

496
00:23:29,360 --> 00:23:31,040
 Someone British in Frasier.

497
00:23:31,040 --> 00:23:34,800
 Not Jane Thing, because she was American doing an accent.

498
00:23:34,800 --> 00:23:35,520
 No, no, she was.

499
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:36,960
 She was British, but it's not Jane Leeds.

500
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:38,080
 Yeah, she was from Manchester.

501
00:23:38,080 --> 00:23:38,880
 Okay.

502
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:39,920
 I'm out.

503
00:23:39,920 --> 00:23:42,080
 And your answer is, yeah, I don't watch Frasier.

504
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:44,560
 Oh, the agent.

505
00:23:44,560 --> 00:23:46,400
 The woman who plays as agent, Bebe.

506
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:48,000
 It's not Bebe Glazer.

507
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:48,560
 Damn it.

508
00:23:48,560 --> 00:23:49,920
 But it's that kind of tier.

509
00:23:49,920 --> 00:23:51,840
 Gil Chesterton.

510
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:52,960
 It's Gil Chesterton.

511
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:55,280
 That's incredible.

512
00:23:55,280 --> 00:23:58,080
 He negotiated the film rights to Fight Club.

513
00:23:58,080 --> 00:23:59,200
 Get out.

514
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:01,760
 Who's Gil Chesterton?

515
00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:03,520
 He's the food critic.

516
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:06,960
 He does the sort of snobby restaurant review show

517
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:09,120
 after Frasier when his show ends.

518
00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:12,080
 Gil's always coming in with his bow tie and his prissy manners.

519
00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:19,200
 If Niles is the character that makes Frasier seem grounded and normal,

520
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:21,760
 Gil would be the character that makes Niles seem.

521
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:25,920
 He's sort of like that pompousness to the nth degree.

522
00:24:25,920 --> 00:24:27,520
 That is incredible.

523
00:24:27,520 --> 00:24:29,520
 And he occasionally pops up in other stuff that actor.

524
00:24:29,520 --> 00:24:31,040
 And it's always a pleasure to see him.

525
00:24:31,040 --> 00:24:33,280
 He turned up in search party and I just loved seeing him.

526
00:24:33,280 --> 00:24:35,760
 So he was a real literary agent.

527
00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:36,240
 And hold on.

528
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:38,560
 Gil Chesterton, what's his name on the show?

529
00:24:38,560 --> 00:24:39,040
 His name?

530
00:24:39,040 --> 00:24:40,080
 Yeah, what's his name?

531
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:42,080
 Edward Hibbet is the name of the actor.

532
00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:43,200
 Edward Hibbet.

533
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:44,880
 Actor and literary agent.

534
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:46,080
 Amazing.

535
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:46,720
 Amazing.

536
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:48,960
 Imagine him turning up and being in your corner.

537
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:50,240
 We're in negotiation.

538
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:51,200
 You just roll over.

539
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:51,920
 That's so good.

540
00:24:51,920 --> 00:24:52,640
 I wonder.

541
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:53,760
 Rawson, what a fact.

542
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:56,080
 You've saved the best to last ambassador.

543
00:24:56,080 --> 00:24:57,200
 Quite specific.

544
00:24:57,200 --> 00:24:59,280
 Yeah, true.

545
00:24:59,280 --> 00:25:00,480
 Very specific.

546
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:02,800
 Another reason it wasn't my main factor is there was some sort of

547
00:25:02,800 --> 00:25:06,400
 embezzlement scandal with the company that he worked for,

548
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:09,600
 which is why I think Chuck is no longer represented by them.

549
00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:13,040
 But you know, I'm sure it will come out in the wash.

550
00:25:13,040 --> 00:25:13,920
 Fantastic.

551
00:25:13,920 --> 00:25:17,600
 One bonus fact, because it has to do with not necessarily-

552
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:19,360
 It's just to do with a minor phrasier character.

553
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:20,800
 Otherwise, I am not interested in that.

554
00:25:20,800 --> 00:25:26,960
 Well, it's to do with the undead, as we were talking about vampires.

555
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:29,520
 But the person I mentioned earlier, John Hodgman,

556
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:32,240
 the former literary agent,

557
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:37,040
 he was the agent to Bruce Campbell, who of evil dead fame,

558
00:25:37,040 --> 00:25:41,680
 the amazing series, his book, "Leading with My Chin"

559
00:25:41,680 --> 00:25:43,920
 is a cult classic in that world.

560
00:25:43,920 --> 00:25:46,320
 And that was Hodgman connected to that.

561
00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:49,760
 I have to say, you just said so many things that I've never heard of in a row.

562
00:25:49,760 --> 00:25:50,880
 Cool.

563
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:53,360
 You know the entire chat you just had about this girl guy?

564
00:25:53,360 --> 00:25:55,680
 Ditto, mate.

565
00:25:55,680 --> 00:25:56,160
 Right.

566
00:25:56,160 --> 00:25:57,520
 No, it doesn't feel good, does it?

567
00:25:57,520 --> 00:26:00,640
 Also left out.

568
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:02,480
 Well, that was excellent, James.

569
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:07,200
 So excited to know those three very, very disparate new facts.

570
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:08,400
 All right.

571
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:10,640
 Thank you so much to James Rawson.

572
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:15,680
 You can get back to being founder of QI and head of all departments.

573
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:17,520
 And we all get back to our day jobs.

574
00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:20,000
 And we'll see you guys in another couple of weeks

575
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:22,000
 for some extra bonus material.

576
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:25,200
 And of course, if you want to get in touch with any of us,

577
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:27,120
 you can get in touch with James.

578
00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:28,560
 How can they get in touch with you?

579
00:26:28,560 --> 00:26:31,360
 I mean, Twitter's such a hell sight now.

580
00:26:31,360 --> 00:26:33,760
 They don't have to.

581
00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:37,280
 Look, if you don't want anyone to get in touch with you, just don't.

582
00:26:37,280 --> 00:26:38,080
 Why don't they go...

583
00:26:38,080 --> 00:26:40,720
 Why don't they, if they love awesome 90s music,

584
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:42,160
 go to one of James's nights?

585
00:26:42,160 --> 00:26:43,840
 So they still happening at the moment, James?

586
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:47,680
 Yeah, come to push the button the last Friday of every month

587
00:26:47,680 --> 00:26:50,560
 at the Royal Voxel Tavern in London.

588
00:26:50,560 --> 00:26:51,920
 Come to the DJ booth.

589
00:26:51,920 --> 00:26:53,360
 We don't take requests.

590
00:26:53,360 --> 00:26:54,560
 We will take compliments.

591
00:26:54,560 --> 00:26:56,000
 There you go.

592
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:56,800
 Push the button.

593
00:26:56,800 --> 00:26:58,560
 That's where to find him.

594
00:26:58,560 --> 00:26:59,600
 Dan, where do they find you?

595
00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:01,360
 Shriverland.

596
00:27:01,360 --> 00:27:02,000
 Cool.

597
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:02,880
 And Andy?

598
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:06,240
 You just didn't say like where there was no at.

599
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:09,920
 This like just goes to this mystical, real universe.

600
00:27:09,920 --> 00:27:11,680
 It's ephemeral.

601
00:27:11,680 --> 00:27:14,320
 It's a state of mind, Shriverland.

602
00:27:14,320 --> 00:27:15,920
 Yeah, it's a frightening place to be.

603
00:27:15,920 --> 00:27:16,880
 Andy, sorry, where are you?

604
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:18,800
 @andyhunterm.

605
00:27:18,800 --> 00:27:19,440
 Great.

606
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:24,400

 We'll see you again very soon.

613
00:27:42,080 --> 00:27:42,880

 Bye.
