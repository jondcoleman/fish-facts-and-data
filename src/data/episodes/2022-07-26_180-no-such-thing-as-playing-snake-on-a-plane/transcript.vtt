 [incomprehensible music]

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:20.480
 Hello and welcome to another episode of No Such Thing as a Fish, a weekly podcast coming

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:25.360
 to you from the QI offices in Covered Garden. My name is Dan Schreiber and I am sitting

00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:31.040
 here with Aniches Isinski and Miller and James Arkin and once again we have gathered around

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:36.160
 the microphones with our four favorite facts from the last seven days and in a particular order

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:42.480
 here we go starting with you and my fact is that Genoa Airport has relaxed its liquid band

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:48.960
 but only for Pesto. I wouldn't even say Pesto was a liquid. It's more like a soup isn't it? Well

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:54.160
 well soup isn't that liquid. You're not allowed to take soups to guys. I mean there is one group

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:58.480
 of people that you don't want to haggle with is probably airport security so they say don't

00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:02.880
 bring it out wouldn't. I went through airport security this time and I went to the passport guy

00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:06.400
 and the guy said have you got a problem and I think he was trying to be nice but he had a glass

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:11.600
 wheat and accidentally sounded like he was trying to find me outside for a fight. Do you guys

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:18.000
 problem it? Did he then say politely do you want to take this outside? Then he politely smacked

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:23.920
 me in the face. But the Pesto campaign so basically this airport was confiscating about 500

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:29.040
 jars of Pesto every few months and decided it was gone too far and so this is sort of it's a charity

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:33.280
 thing really. It's a campaign called Pesto is good. You're allowed one 500 mil jar of Pesto

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:38.480
 and you buy a 50 euro stamp which will let you take it on board and they scan it through the same

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:41.840
 machine that medicine and breast milk goes through. And so is this a tourism thing? Were they

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:46.880
 feeling a financial knock? Well I think partly because they are known for Pesto in that area

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:50.480
 so it gets nice to bring but also I think it's slightly and it gets a charity thing so the money

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:54.000
 goes through a company called the Flying Angels Foundation which brings in kids from developing

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:58.160
 world who need to have some operations. But similar thing happened in City Airport. They were

00:01:58.160 --> 00:02:01.760
 using an awful lot of Mormite so this summer they did a Mormite Amnesty where you could trade in

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:08.720
 your big jar for a small pot. Mormite is an interesting liquidity one. Is it a liquid? Well it is

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:12.720
 unless you bash it really hard and then it turns into a solid because it's non-utonial. That's not

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:18.960
 true is it? So all we need to do is invent this non-utonial liquid to be applied to things like

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:24.240
 bottles of water and you can give it a smack before you get to immigration. It goes in as a solid

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:28.480
 block. Bring in a block of ice. Why don't you just bring in a massive block of ice in a bottle?

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:34.160
 So you can do that. If you freeze your water and you bring in a bottle of ice then they will let you

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:38.800
 bring it through. I think actually somewhere and somewhere. Maybe. It's actually an interesting thing

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:43.040
 with airports confiscating things. A lot of airports don't have the same rules so in some airports

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:46.720
 lipsticks count as liquid and something counts as solid. It's so weird what you can and can't bring

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:53.600
 onto planes. I was reading this year that the TSA in America confirmed via their Instagram that you're

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:59.040
 allowed to bring live lobsters on as part of your carry-on luggage. Well they're not liquid.

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:04.400
 That's true so. Humans are quite liquid by that logic so why should we be in order? We're 70% water.

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:09.120
 Oh yeah. So why are we in order? Because someone gets us a slap before we go through the immigration.

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:14.800
 But the other thing is your live lobster presumably likes living in water so how do you keep it alive

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:20.720
 without bringing the water in here? Yeah you get them 20 tiny waters and then you put it in Pesto.

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:26.080
 Yeah. The photo in question on the Instagram that they uploaded was of a 20 pound lobster.

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:31.520
 It's ginormous and it was allowed on because lobsters are allowed on. They're just put in the overhead

00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:37.440
 carry storage. Do you know that the TSA, their Instagram is crazy popular. It's got 780,000 followers

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:41.440
 and at Rolling Stone named it the fourth best Instagram accounts in the world beating NASA.

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:49.680
 NASA's beyond say on the TSA. The TSA is the top. So it's Kim Kardashian, that geo

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:54.240
 somebody I've forgotten then TSA then beyond say then NASA. Got poor poor somebody who you've

00:03:54.240 --> 00:04:00.560
 forgotten they've worked so hard. They've made it the top three. It really doesn't be. What a slam.

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:08.000
 Really sorry number three. But so their account is amazing so they confiscate nine guns a day

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:13.200
 in American airports most of them are loaded and on this Instagram they basically the Instagram is

00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:17.040
 pictures of stuff that's been confiscated and their dogs does very well in the internet. But things

00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:22.160
 they've taken include live eels, a live grenade, a knife hidden inside an enchilada, a medieval mace,

00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:26.160
 a dagger hidden inside a replica of the Eiffel Tower and a chihuahua that's leaked into its owners

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:31.200
 back when they weren't looking. You know when they started banning liquids on planes they weren't

00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:35.440
 short to do about breast milk at first and they quite quickly decided that breast milk should be the

00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:39.920
 one exception which it is but it used to be the case that women were sometimes asked to prove that

00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:44.880
 it was their own breast milk by drinking it. But a lot of them said it was disgusting so one

00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:48.800
 woman said it was embarrassing and disgusting having to drink my own breast milk. I wonder if it

00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:53.520
 goes back in and just refills. I don't know how that works. Not directly. In terms of the body. I

00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:56.480
 think it spoils it. I think there's an article a while ago with someone who got me made to do that.

00:04:56.480 --> 00:05:00.800
 I was like but if I do that it won't all keep. I think she'd be on my business trip or something

00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:04.640
 and they made her taste it all. But then it spoils and you can't keep it. So what's the whole point?

00:05:04.640 --> 00:05:09.600
 So when they first started banning things they originally banned pens for the first couple of

00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:15.440
 weeks on the grounds that the ink they contained was a fluid. Yeah. Makes sense. How come they were

00:05:15.440 --> 00:05:19.840
 like that back on? I think if your pen has more than 100 milliliters of ink in it then you've

00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:25.200
 probably got the wrong pen manufacturing. It can be well as novelty life, large pens that you're

00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:31.760
 bringing in. Oh I just I'm signing a massive check. I need to sign on this pen. And then they also

00:05:31.760 --> 00:05:36.480
 stop people from bringing phones on for a while and so many people were upset about that that people

00:05:36.480 --> 00:05:43.280
 were switching their Paris or Brussels flights from London at a rate of 10 a minute. Oh yeah they lost

00:05:43.280 --> 00:05:47.520
 loads of money British Airways didn't they? They lost like a million dollars in a really short amount

00:05:47.520 --> 00:05:52.880
 of time. Oh 50. But yeah because people are so desperate to have their phones for just a one-hour

00:05:52.880 --> 00:05:57.600
 plane journey. It's not a long trip from London to Paris. No. And you can't use your phone in the air.

00:05:57.600 --> 00:06:05.760
 No but maybe if you had a blackberry you could kind of draft some emails. Yeah. All play on snake.

00:06:05.760 --> 00:06:12.640
 Yeah, play snake. Snake was huge back then. Snakes on a plane. I was reading about things that have

00:06:12.640 --> 00:06:20.640
 been left at airports this year. So the first is a headstone that was found that had the inscription

00:06:20.640 --> 00:06:25.440
 you will always be remembered never forgotten. That was left at an airport. That was a

00:06:25.440 --> 00:06:31.920
 double ad airport that they accidentally left. We never forget a headstone. There's also a toilet seat,

00:06:31.920 --> 00:06:37.520
 a sister and human ash, false teeth and glass eyes. So that's all from the last few years. Did you

00:06:37.520 --> 00:06:42.240
 say a toilet seat and a sister? Yeah. That sounds like someone on a gap here who's heard the facilities

00:06:42.240 --> 00:06:47.280
 in Indonesia are really bad and they've brought, I'll just bring my own toilet. It's fine. Yeah.

00:06:47.280 --> 00:06:51.120
 Carrying around with them. Well speaking of toilets and airport. Again just news from this year

00:06:51.120 --> 00:06:59.120
 involving airports and toilets. There's a airport in Tokyo that for a few months of this year provided

00:06:59.120 --> 00:07:05.680
 toilet paper for anyone on the toilets for not only themselves but then a separate toilet system

00:07:05.680 --> 00:07:10.800
 that provided paper for their smartphones. So you'd wipe your bum and then you--

00:07:10.800 --> 00:07:15.760
 With your smartphone. No, no, no. Then you wipe your smartphone with a toilet. No, so you would have

00:07:15.760 --> 00:07:21.120
 one toilet roll for your bum and then another toilet roll for your smartphone. A smaller mini roll

00:07:21.120 --> 00:07:24.880
 because they were worried that so many people use their phone now on the toilets that they're

00:07:24.880 --> 00:07:28.640
 getting all sorts of dirty bacteria on them and then that goes on to their head when they hold it

00:07:28.640 --> 00:07:33.520
 on. So this is just a little bit of toilet roll to just wipe your smartphone down once you're done

00:07:33.520 --> 00:07:45.120
 on the toilet. It looks like you can't fold up to a paper and make it smaller. Okay, it is time for fact

00:07:45.120 --> 00:07:51.840
 number two and that is James. Okay, my fact this week is that it has been scientifically proven

00:07:51.840 --> 00:07:55.840
 that the Beatles were an average band who didn't really influence music.

00:07:56.560 --> 00:08:01.680
 Outrageous. Proven by whom? Yeah, it's just outrageous. Well, I'm mostly saying this just to wind

00:08:01.680 --> 00:08:09.200
 down up. But this is a real study. It was done by a biologist called Amanda LaRoy and he's from the

00:08:09.200 --> 00:08:15.440
 Imperial College London and what he is, he's an evolutionary biologist and he plotted the 50 years

00:08:15.440 --> 00:08:20.880
 of hit singles from the US Billboard chart into a computer program that models evolution and found

00:08:20.880 --> 00:08:25.840
 out which song was influenced by which song. He found out that the Beatles are just kind of an

00:08:25.840 --> 00:08:31.040
 average band who didn't really influence that many people. Oh, yeah. And really, around that time it

00:08:31.040 --> 00:08:36.800
 was more the who and the Rolling Stones that did the influencing and overall it's more hip-hop music.

00:08:36.800 --> 00:08:42.640
 So is this sort of changes in musical style? Like kind of that. Just changes in the direction

00:08:42.640 --> 00:08:47.440
 of where music was going. Yeah, kind of. So what they did was they got 30-second snippets of

00:08:47.440 --> 00:08:51.360
 music and they put it into the computer program and the computer program could tell a difference

00:08:51.360 --> 00:08:56.160
 between different musical properties like instruments used or chord patterns or whatever and they

00:08:56.160 --> 00:09:02.800
 looked to where they might have got that idea from in an evolutionary way. Okay. But I think it's an

00:09:02.800 --> 00:09:09.440
 interesting point, isn't it? Nope. Because if you like, you're more likely to find bands that say

00:09:09.440 --> 00:09:13.120
 Beatles are an influence of them then you are not, I would say. So I think what we're saying is all

00:09:13.120 --> 00:09:19.040
 those bands are wrong. I know. Who knew? I think this guy did acknowledge that the Beatles were still

00:09:19.040 --> 00:09:23.520
 part of that revolution in American music. It was just like the Rolling Stones and the who seemed to

00:09:23.520 --> 00:09:27.760
 create more of a change and he also didn't acknowledge the very obvious truth that because the Beatles

00:09:27.760 --> 00:09:32.880
 were heard so widely by so many people even if A change was coming in music that they influenced

00:09:32.880 --> 00:09:38.160
 them they were then the ones who influenced so many more people because they were just so popular.

00:09:38.160 --> 00:09:43.360
 Bob Dylan, I can't remember the exact quote but Bob Dylan said that the Beatles changed America

00:09:43.360 --> 00:09:48.800
 completely. They knocked America into basically a revolution of culture. And Bob Dylan and the Beatles

00:09:48.800 --> 00:09:53.360
 had a bit of an awkward relationship though, didn't they? Like John Lennon loved Bob Dylan and

00:09:53.360 --> 00:09:57.760
 you know was inspired by some Bob Dylan songs to write things like Norwegian Word and to go a bit

00:09:57.760 --> 00:10:02.880
 deeper. But Bob Dylan, I think people think, wasn't really influenced by the Beatles at all.

00:10:02.880 --> 00:10:07.440
 And yet now has written one of his best new songs on his new album is called Dear John or

00:10:07.440 --> 00:10:12.720
 Something. It's a really moving song about John Lennon. Is it? Yeah. So Armand LaRoy, who is the guy

00:10:12.720 --> 00:10:16.960
 behind this studio, one of the guys behind this study, he's also one of the guys behind a thing

00:10:16.960 --> 00:10:23.120
 called DarwinTunes.org. And this is a website from a few years ago where they would play you some

00:10:23.120 --> 00:10:27.440
 music and then you say whether you liked it or that you didn't like it and they keep doing that and

00:10:27.440 --> 00:10:33.120
 then eventually they hope to evolve the perfect bit of music that everyone liked. So again, it's

00:10:33.120 --> 00:10:38.320
 a kind of evolution through music. So I'm going to play you some of this and see what you think about

00:10:38.320 --> 00:10:43.680
 this. So this is a song that in theory all of us in this room should like. Well, I'll start off

00:10:43.680 --> 00:10:49.440
 doing something that was from 150 generations. So 150 times people have said I like this, I don't like

00:10:49.440 --> 00:10:53.280
 this and it kind of evolved into a certain kind of music. So this is this.

00:11:06.080 --> 00:11:11.680
 Well, it's not bad for something to play with a Nokia. Yeah. Yeah, you're not impressed. Well, no.

00:11:11.680 --> 00:11:19.360
 Okay, so what I'll do now is I'll play you something from 8,700 generations. So this has gone

00:11:19.360 --> 00:11:24.080
 through much more evolution. So this in theory should be much more nice to the ear so you think of this.

00:11:24.080 --> 00:11:46.320
 Exciting.

00:11:46.320 --> 00:11:50.160
 It's slightly better. I still feel like it's not quite a Beatles level.

00:11:51.040 --> 00:12:06.640
 I've found a few interesting connections between Beatles and Comedy. Okay. So this is an interesting

00:12:06.640 --> 00:12:12.080
 thing to me and perhaps comedy fans out there. There was a team called. I can't imagine any comedy fans

00:12:12.080 --> 00:12:17.280
 are listening to this. Yeah, that's true. So I'll do a bit of explaining. There used to be a group

00:12:17.280 --> 00:12:22.400
 called Beyond the Fringe, starred Dudley Moore, Peter Cook, Jonathan Miller, Alan Bennett. They

00:12:22.400 --> 00:12:28.240
 were the big awakening of comedy in the 1950s in Britain. Did a lot of satirical stuff, kind of the

00:12:28.240 --> 00:12:36.080
 birth of satire, some would say. And the applause that was used at their show for their recording was

00:12:36.080 --> 00:12:41.040
 taken by the producer of George Martin who did all of the Beatles stuff and he put it to the beginning

00:12:41.040 --> 00:12:46.080
 of Sergeant Pepper. So if you know the song Sergeant Peppers, when there's that, let me introduce you,

00:12:46.080 --> 00:12:51.280
 the act you know, there's lots of applause going on. That's from Beyond the Fringe in the 1950s. Yeah,

00:12:51.280 --> 00:12:56.720
 it's a comedy applause going on. So this year it's been the 50-year anniversary of Sergeant Pepper's

00:12:56.720 --> 00:13:03.360
 Lonely Hearts Club band. That's right. Do you know that Adolf Hitler is on the cover of that album?

00:13:03.360 --> 00:13:08.640
 So they have, if you know the iconic album, it's loads and loads of faces. They didn't have Jesus

00:13:08.640 --> 00:13:14.720
 on there and they didn't have Gandhi, but they do have Adolf Hitler. Okay. Do they? I don't

00:13:14.720 --> 00:13:19.520
 remember him being on there. Well, it's in disguise. He is a little bit. He's behind the Beatles.

00:13:19.520 --> 00:13:26.160
 He's completely obscured. Completely obscured. This is according to the guy who made it,

00:13:26.160 --> 00:13:31.920
 who's called Peter Blake. Yeah. And I don't know if he's joking or not, but he did say that when

00:13:31.920 --> 00:13:35.600
 you look at the photographs of the outtakes and that they were doing at the time, you can see that

00:13:35.600 --> 00:13:40.000
 Hitler was there. But actually when they did the final picture, he was hiding behind the Beatles

00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:45.200
 themselves. That does sound a bit familiar actually. Yeah. Oh god. They need to do, you know, when they do

00:13:45.200 --> 00:13:49.520
 sort of weird ultrasound scans on great works of Renaissance art and they find another Mona Lisa

00:13:49.520 --> 00:13:54.400
 underneath the Mona Lisa. They need to do that to the album cover. It could be also as a people

00:13:54.400 --> 00:14:00.720
 under that. Yeah. I was reading about how people at some times it said that John Lennon created

00:14:00.720 --> 00:14:03.840
 sort of flipping sound around when he threaded up his real player at the runway round.

00:14:03.840 --> 00:14:08.560
 Yeah. It was there before, but they popularised it. And I apparently. George learned his solo

00:14:08.560 --> 00:14:12.480
 backwards rhyme only sleeping, then they reversed it and they were recording. It's kind of cool if he

00:14:12.480 --> 00:14:17.360
 did. That's true. Very cool. He recited the words backwards. No, the solo on the guitar.

00:14:17.360 --> 00:14:21.920
 Oh really? Which if true is quite cool. Because he was sound editing now. Things like splicing,

00:14:21.920 --> 00:14:26.320
 cutting, moving around is really easy, but then it was all literally cutting off the film yourself

00:14:26.320 --> 00:14:30.160
 and moving it. Yeah. It's just kind of like that. So when they did a take, I was strawberry feels

00:14:30.160 --> 00:14:33.840
 forever. I John Lennon wanted part from one take and part from a different take. And so they

00:14:33.840 --> 00:14:37.760
 but they recorded at different tempos and different pitches. So they had to try and sort of merge

00:14:37.760 --> 00:14:41.600
 the two because otherwise it can't just switch halfway through from like different keys. Yeah.

00:14:41.600 --> 00:14:45.680
 The reverse technique thing is really interesting because they do that in comedy films as well,

00:14:45.680 --> 00:14:51.040
 particularly for slapstick movies, they do it for when the slapstick stunt is so outrageously harsh.

00:14:51.040 --> 00:14:57.280
 Yeah. They start it backwards. So say for example in guesthouse parody, so they slam in two sharp

00:14:57.280 --> 00:15:02.320
 forks into Adrian Edmondson's nostril. So you see the hand go huang and just hook his nose right

00:15:02.320 --> 00:15:06.480
 up and you couldn't do that. Even with rubber, it's such a tight precision thing. Oh, I see,

00:15:06.480 --> 00:15:14.240
 but you can pull them out. So Adrian Edmondson had to learn his lines backwards, say it to the screen,

00:15:14.240 --> 00:15:18.560
 and then they remove it. And then when you flip it the other way around, it goes in and then his

00:15:18.560 --> 00:15:23.040
 lines are forward. There was another music study I was reading about that was done quite recently,

00:15:23.040 --> 00:15:29.280
 which was a study that was done in Spain, which looked into how pop music has changed. And if just

00:15:29.280 --> 00:15:34.960
 to kind of satisfy I guess our parents generation, it found that it has got too loud and it all sounds

00:15:34.960 --> 00:15:41.920
 the same now. So a study found that a study found this. They analyzed 464,000 songs from 1950s to

00:15:41.920 --> 00:15:47.600
 2010 and they looked at like the diversity of note combinations and they looked at different core

00:15:47.600 --> 00:15:52.080
 progressions and when they changed keys and stuff like that. And they found that the melodies of

00:15:52.080 --> 00:15:56.880
 songs today are almost similar to each other and that they don't have as many changes within them

00:15:56.880 --> 00:16:01.360
 that the timbrel palette employed is less. So that's the different kind of instruments in the

00:16:01.360 --> 00:16:06.400
 olden days you'd have some trumpets and you'd have an organ suddenly and you'd have a triangle but

00:16:06.400 --> 00:16:11.360
 now it's just you know a lot of it's more electric. Are we necessarily saying that that is worse or

00:16:11.360 --> 00:16:15.520
 better? They certainly weren't because they are objective scientists. It's not for scientists you see.

00:16:15.520 --> 00:16:22.240
 But I am. So what you could say is that they really tried lots of different things over the years and

00:16:22.240 --> 00:16:26.480
 now we've found something that really works and it's Taylor Swift's new song. You could say that.

00:16:26.480 --> 00:16:32.960
 Recurrently breaking all records on YouTube guys. Is it only half of them are me?

00:16:32.960 --> 00:16:42.560
 Okay it is time for fact number three and that is Chuzinski. My fact this week is that when the first

00:16:42.560 --> 00:16:47.840
 pilgrims went over on the Mayflower one of them brought 139 pairs of shoes with him.

00:16:47.840 --> 00:16:56.320
 So this is the voyage of the Mayflower which was in 1620 when a bunch of pilgrims went over

00:16:56.320 --> 00:17:00.640
 and they landed in America and they set up the first permanent settlement in New England and

00:17:00.640 --> 00:17:05.680
 so obviously extremely famous and it's the pilgrim fathers and yeah they actually were not very

00:17:05.680 --> 00:17:11.680
 well prepared to go and take over a new totally unexplored really land. Well it sounds like the

00:17:11.680 --> 00:17:15.760
 prepared if they're going to do a lot of walking. I'm not even sure they were practical walking

00:17:15.760 --> 00:17:22.400
 shoes. I've got to say it was 126 pairs of shoes and 13 pairs of boots and to be fair he was a

00:17:22.400 --> 00:17:27.760
 shoemaker. It was a guy called William Muller. Maybe he thought he was going to sell them to the locals?

00:17:27.760 --> 00:17:32.160
 I don't know. I mean what else is he going to bring with him? Yeah he's not going to bring sausages

00:17:32.160 --> 00:17:39.520
 with him is he shoemaker? He's a shoemaker. Actually there was around 130 passengers in total on

00:17:39.520 --> 00:17:44.000
 board so a pair of shoes for each so maybe he was thinking business terms. But the rest of them didn't

00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:49.200
 go barefoot. They just all brought the sensible one pair, one spare pair. But yeah they weren't very

00:17:49.200 --> 00:17:54.000
 well prepared. They didn't bring kind of useful things like kind of fishing lines or a plow.

00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:58.480
 But yeah some other people brought a trumpet, someone brought a drum, someone brought a complete

00:17:58.480 --> 00:18:04.400
 history of turkey. So these were sort of almost gentlemen. These people so they wanted to take

00:18:04.400 --> 00:18:09.280
 stuff that they valued which wasn't necessarily the super useful stuff that a labourer would be able

00:18:09.280 --> 00:18:12.720
 to work with. Do you know there were two babies born on the Mayflower. One was born when they

00:18:12.720 --> 00:18:19.120
 doctor in America and one was born at sea and they named him Oceanus. That was so nice. I was actually

00:18:19.120 --> 00:18:26.880
 reading into Oceanus. I was pronouncing that Oceanus. Oceanus Hopkins was his name.

00:18:26.880 --> 00:18:33.520
 Had he kept his mother's maiden name he would have been called Oceanus Fischer which is quite nice

00:18:33.520 --> 00:18:42.000
 as Oceanus. So unfortunately Oceanus didn't live too long. He died probably six years into life.

00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:49.200
 They're not fully sure. But his father Stephen Hopkins has an interesting story because he was part

00:18:49.200 --> 00:18:55.520
 of the crew on the Mayflower but he was also on a boat that tried a settle in the New World 10 years

00:18:55.520 --> 00:19:02.960
 earlier in Jamestown in Virginia and on his way there the boat got wrecked off the coast of

00:19:02.960 --> 00:19:07.200
 Bermuda and he got stranded there with a bunch of other fellow passengers for several months

00:19:07.200 --> 00:19:13.840
 and the story of that rescue that brought them back was what William Shakespeare says he

00:19:13.840 --> 00:19:20.880
 based the tempest on. Oh no way. It's speculated. It's speculated. But they're questioning whether even one

00:19:20.880 --> 00:19:28.000
 of the characters as well was named after Stephen Hopkins. Oceanus is dead because there's Stefano

00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:33.280
 in the tempest and supposedly Stephen Hopkins was one of Shakespeare's neighbors supposedly lived

00:19:33.280 --> 00:19:39.280
 in the same area as Shakespeare. So quite a famous family by default in situation. Quite a lot of

00:19:39.280 --> 00:19:44.640
 adventures were one guy and he worked with John Smith as well of Pocahontas fame so that was Jamestown

00:19:44.640 --> 00:19:48.800
 well that was because he was a guy who went to Jamestown 10 years earlier whatever so yeah he was

00:19:48.800 --> 00:19:52.720
 working with John Smith to try and set up their colony there. He had like a mission to get

00:19:52.720 --> 00:19:59.040
 as many movies as possible before movies were a thing. Yeah good point. He's like you know those

00:19:59.040 --> 00:20:04.000
 actors that you get that are in basically every movie. Yeah like they've just got the one line or whatever.

00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:09.200
 He's a bit like John Goodman who's in every good movie like he was for ages whenever there was

00:20:09.200 --> 00:20:14.720
 a best picture he was in Argo and he was in the artist and he was in everything wasn't he but never

00:20:14.720 --> 00:20:19.600
 had a main part. Do you know James that is unbelievably weird that you've just said that because

00:20:19.600 --> 00:20:25.440
 a John Goodman was on board the Mayflower. No that's the same guy. Yeah he's much older than he is.

00:20:25.440 --> 00:20:30.320
 He's got really good moisture I think. Oh my god. There were also I was just looking at the name so

00:20:30.320 --> 00:20:34.320
 there were some other good names because they were pilgrims they were religious a lot of them so

00:20:34.320 --> 00:20:38.080
 they named their children strange things like there was someone called remember there was someone

00:20:38.080 --> 00:20:42.240
 called resolved and someone called humility and then they were actually remember they left him

00:20:42.240 --> 00:20:49.440
 in the departure lunch. There was William Brewster who was one of the most famous people who

00:20:49.440 --> 00:20:54.240
 went across and became an elder in the community. He brought his children who were called true love

00:20:54.240 --> 00:21:00.800
 and wrestling. Yeah wrestling I saw that it's so cool. Wrestling Brewster his name. Such a good name

00:21:00.800 --> 00:21:05.040
 that's something straight out of lockstalk or something. Can I just say done you are about to have

00:21:05.040 --> 00:21:09.200
 a baby scene. Yeah. Wrestling is a strong name. Wrestling is an incredibly good name. Wrestling

00:21:09.200 --> 00:21:17.040
 Shriver. Yeah that was good. Or Oceanus is also a very strong option. Constantly correcting the

00:21:17.040 --> 00:21:29.920
 pronunciation of his name. It's actually anus. So they were trying to escape religious tolerance or

00:21:29.920 --> 00:21:33.200
 intolerance depending on which way you look at it. They were basically trying to escape the

00:21:33.200 --> 00:21:39.520
 Anglicans with the Puritans but of the just over 100 people on the boat more than 60 of them were

00:21:39.520 --> 00:21:43.600
 Anglicans so they were trying to escape them but they were basically with them on the boat the

00:21:43.600 --> 00:21:50.560
 whole way and they called themselves the saints the Puritans and they called the Anglican strangers

00:21:50.560 --> 00:21:56.640
 but the crew on the Mayflower called the Puritans sound singing puke stockings.

00:21:56.640 --> 00:22:03.120
 In a flattering way? Do they have something different? I'm not sure how that can be

00:22:03.120 --> 00:22:07.760
 flattering puke stocking. I can only imagine that they had puke coloured stockings.

00:22:09.200 --> 00:22:15.040
 Yeah because the Mayflower left a bit later than the Mente because there is another ship called

00:22:15.040 --> 00:22:20.400
 Speedwell and they're both done part of the journey but then Speedwell got a leak and so its

00:22:20.400 --> 00:22:23.520
 passengers went on to Mayflower because they wasted time and meant the Mayflower had to go through

00:22:23.520 --> 00:22:26.800
 sort of chop your water and storm season. They've been trying to avoid so you probably would want

00:22:26.800 --> 00:22:30.160
 a puke stocking if you were on this. So do you think maybe they were just pukeying a lot?

00:22:30.160 --> 00:22:32.400
 That's why they called puke stockings. Probably into their stockings.

00:22:34.160 --> 00:22:44.960
 The stick bag of the 17th century. So it's the 400th anniversary of the trip in 2020 and I was reading

00:22:44.960 --> 00:22:50.720
 that in order to celebrate it. There's a company that is creating a virtual reality so you put on

00:22:50.720 --> 00:22:55.520
 the VR thing and it's going to place you on the boat and it replicates the whole journey so they're

00:22:55.520 --> 00:23:00.800
 going to make it sail from Plymouth to Plymouth. So you can do some virtual pukeying into your stockings.

00:23:00.800 --> 00:23:04.960
 Exactly. I wonder if that's an element that they're going to add to it in the carter. Yeah, exactly.

00:23:04.960 --> 00:23:16.320
 Okay, it is time for our final fact of the show and that is my fact. My fact this week is that

00:23:16.320 --> 00:23:23.680
 a new scientific paper on why horses only have one toe has been published. The author of that paper

00:23:23.680 --> 00:23:30.240
 is called Brianna MacHorse. MacHorse. That's brilliant. It's not even a name. It's not a

00:23:30.240 --> 00:23:35.360
 name. It's a name. It is a name. It is a name that people have had before. Yes, in fact, if you go to

00:23:35.360 --> 00:23:41.360
 MacHorse.com, there's a man charting all the MacHorse's through history. They say that they're all

00:23:41.360 --> 00:23:48.080
 descended from John W. MacHorse who was born in 1819. No, really. And no one's quite sure why he got

00:23:48.080 --> 00:23:52.320
 called MacHorse because it doesn't seem like there were any MacHorse's before him. But according to

00:23:52.320 --> 00:23:58.880
 one idea, he was in America and he was hanging out with a guy called Sam Houston but he was called

00:23:58.880 --> 00:24:04.880
 MacHorse at the time. Sam Houston said MacHorse would be a better name for a Texan than MacHorse.

00:24:04.880 --> 00:24:14.080
 And so maybe the name came as a joke. Yes, and MacHorse/MacHorse went on to have 12 children.

00:24:14.080 --> 00:24:20.720
 So the name spread like wildfire even in its first generation of use. And if you go to MacHorse.com,

00:24:20.720 --> 00:24:25.600
 the guy who runs it, who is a MacHorse himself, no one else is going to be running MacHorse.com.

00:24:25.600 --> 00:24:31.280
 That's a Saturday job. He has a spreadsheet of the genealogy and family

00:24:31.280 --> 00:24:35.840
 tree of all the MacHorse's since that guy. And it's amazing how many MacHorse's you can get since

00:24:35.840 --> 00:24:41.440
 1819. There's a lot. It's quite cool to have a name where you can pinpoint when it came and then

00:24:41.440 --> 00:24:46.000
 to see like tracing it back because there's tons of Miller. It's like you know if you're a MacHorse,

00:24:46.000 --> 00:24:50.400
 the gods that you're related to that MacHorse prey high. Yeah. MacHorse does sound like it's a burger

00:24:50.400 --> 00:24:55.760
 you can get in French but Donalds doesn't it? It does. Yeah. It also sounds like if it means son of,

00:24:55.760 --> 00:25:00.720
 then it sounds like you'd call someone MacHorse as an insulting joke saying your mum obviously

00:25:00.720 --> 00:25:04.400
 shagged a horse, doesn't it? Because you're saying son of horse. I'm putting that forward as an

00:25:04.400 --> 00:25:08.480
 alternative theory for the origin of the name based on no evidence. Don't tell the guy that runs

00:25:08.480 --> 00:25:15.200
 like website if he got it. So the paper that MacHorse published, Brianna MacHorse, is mechanics of

00:25:15.200 --> 00:25:20.320
 evolutionary digit reduction in fossil horses. So the thing to know about her is she had

00:25:20.320 --> 00:25:25.520
 doesn't study horses for a living. She is an evolutionary biologist and she's just been looking

00:25:25.520 --> 00:25:34.000
 into why horses now have this one toe as opposed to five which is what their ancestors might have had.

00:25:34.000 --> 00:25:38.960
 Their ancestors might have had four on the front and three on the back I think. Okay. If you look at

00:25:38.960 --> 00:25:44.880
 tape ears that's what they have which is like similar to an old kind of horse and they reckon that

00:25:44.880 --> 00:25:51.600
 basically it helps them to run faster because if you've got long slim legs with just these one toes

00:25:51.600 --> 00:25:56.320
 it helps you to gallop and the reason they had to do that is because they stop living in the forest

00:25:56.320 --> 00:26:00.240
 because there were no forests when the ice age hit America. So there were no forests they had to

00:26:00.240 --> 00:26:04.720
 live in the open so they had to run away from predators and so they needed really speedy legs.

00:26:04.720 --> 00:26:11.600
 If horses had feet like we have feet so like literally a foot would that be better for them

00:26:11.600 --> 00:26:17.200
 or are they the ultimate? I think what we're saying is for what they evolved into which was this

00:26:17.200 --> 00:26:21.920
 large open pastures with no forest this was the best that they could come up with presumably that's

00:26:21.920 --> 00:26:26.720
 how evolution works. I think probably the more direct answer your question is no if the horse was

00:26:26.720 --> 00:26:32.320
 randomly born with four human feet on the end of its legs. It will be at a disadvantage. But

00:26:32.320 --> 00:26:36.080
 it had human feet it could wear a trainer as well having to go to a blacksmith so it'd be more

00:26:36.080 --> 00:26:39.920
 convenient. That's a really good point and they don't make those bouncing Nike horse shoes

00:26:39.920 --> 00:26:46.720
 today. Also horses did evolve in America so maybe when this guy came over on the Mayflower he

00:26:46.720 --> 00:26:52.560
 thought he could sell his shoes to all these people. Come on guys this is really gonna help you out.

00:26:52.560 --> 00:26:56.160
 But he said Brianna didn't it's not she didn't set out to study horses but she may have been drawn

00:26:56.160 --> 00:27:00.400
 towards them so there was a 2002 academic paper about nominative determinism which is brilliantly

00:27:00.400 --> 00:27:05.200
 called why Susie sells seashells by the sea shore implicit egotism and major life decisions

00:27:05.200 --> 00:27:08.800
 which found that people disproportionately do tend to pick careers that mirror their names so they

00:27:08.800 --> 00:27:12.320
 have a larger proportionally expected denisers and denisers in the dentistry industry.

00:27:12.320 --> 00:27:17.440
 Although not everyone believes it today there have been a few papers since that kind of

00:27:17.440 --> 00:27:21.920
 think that maybe they slightly cherry picked their data. That's true I read that paper by Albert

00:27:21.920 --> 00:27:29.120
 Skeptical. It's really hard to please. A great one this is not nominative determinism but I was

00:27:29.120 --> 00:27:35.520
 watching what I liked you last night the comedy panel show and David Hay the boxer was a guest

00:27:35.520 --> 00:27:42.640
 on it and he named his son Cassius after Cassius Clay Muhammad Ali but that means his son is

00:27:42.640 --> 00:27:49.280
 called Cassius Hay. It's fantastic. Okay well Brianna got a big laugh of the show with that.

00:27:49.280 --> 00:27:56.640
 That's the way you tell them. I just that reminded me of a fact which is in our new fact book which

00:27:56.640 --> 00:28:03.040
 comes out this year which is that on the USPGA most golfers play with a glove to keep their hands

00:28:03.040 --> 00:28:07.680
 from blistering but the one of the only players it doesn't use a glove is called Lucas Glover.

00:28:07.680 --> 00:28:13.120
 Do you know James just while we're talking sports? Do you know who the new reigning champion of most

00:28:13.120 --> 00:28:22.240
 bullseyes in a minute is for darts? Phil Taylor? No. If I name a load of dance players will I get it?

00:28:22.240 --> 00:28:28.400
 No you you're in the wrong industry. Oh is it Steve Bakley the javelin thrower? No. Robin Hood.

00:28:28.400 --> 00:28:34.960
 It's Lee Mack the comedian. Come off it. Yeah Lee Mack. He set the record this year and he beat it

00:28:34.960 --> 00:28:41.360
 by one for most bullseyes within a minute and I learnt this on a TV show called Would I Like To You?

00:28:41.360 --> 00:28:47.920
 Was it true or was it a lie? It was true. Out of interest just so we know how many of your facts

00:28:47.920 --> 00:28:51.600
 this week have come from Would I Like To You? And should we give them a credit? It's the whole thing's

00:28:51.600 --> 00:29:00.800
 just that. Is it more or less than 20? Less. That's a lie. Yes. Dammit points to James. Have you guys ever seen

00:29:00.800 --> 00:29:05.200
 you guys would have seen this clip it on the screen? Would I like to? Yeah loads times. Yeah it's great.

00:29:05.200 --> 00:29:15.520
 How good was that whole Cassius Haven? Have you guys ever seen the feat of a newborn horse? No. They are

00:29:15.520 --> 00:29:20.080
 incredible. So guys if you're listening at home you've got a Google image this right now.

00:29:20.880 --> 00:29:26.080
 What they look like is I was trying to work out a good metaphor for them actually how to how to

00:29:26.080 --> 00:29:31.680
 describe them. They look like kind of a cross between a squishy crab claw and anemone

00:29:31.680 --> 00:29:38.000
 with like a bit of cat's paw in it and they're really slimy and what it is is if the horse was born

00:29:38.000 --> 00:29:43.200
 with its hoof fully exposed it would damage the mother's birth canal as it came out. And so the hoof

00:29:43.200 --> 00:29:48.560
 is covered in this kind of grotesque slimy anenomy layer which stops it from being damaged and then

00:29:48.560 --> 00:29:53.120
 it falls off as soon as the horse is born. So the way that some animals would do it is they would come

00:29:53.120 --> 00:29:57.840
 out not quite fully formed so that it wouldn't do that. But horses are in danger as soon as they're

00:29:57.840 --> 00:30:03.920
 born because the mother spills her birth fluids everywhere and immediately that alerts predators to

00:30:03.920 --> 00:30:08.400
 the scent. So the foal needs to be ready to run as soon as it pops out. So it pops out and then

00:30:08.400 --> 00:30:13.440
 it sheds this slimy layer of goo on its feet and then it gallops away. Wow. But is the most

00:30:13.440 --> 00:30:17.760
 amazing thing if you see it you would never guess it belonged to a horse. Scary isn't it with animals

00:30:17.760 --> 00:30:22.000
 like that. It's almost like you're being born into the beginning moment of the Hunger Games.

00:30:22.000 --> 00:30:27.520
 Like the platform comes up and there's a siren and you just have to survive. Yeah you're right.

00:30:27.520 --> 00:30:33.520
 That's your opening moment into life. I've got something on a race horse. Okay. The greatest race

00:30:33.520 --> 00:30:41.920
 horse of all time. He was called a Clips and was born in the 1764 solar eclipse around that time

00:30:41.920 --> 00:30:47.280
 and that's why they got the name. And he had to retire from racing because he wasn't so often

00:30:47.280 --> 00:30:52.720
 no one would ever bet on any other horse. No way. Wow. And at the time I mean still but at the time

00:30:52.720 --> 00:30:58.080
 horse racing was all about the gambling. Wow. And so he was so good. They just wouldn't let him race

00:30:58.080 --> 00:31:03.680
 anymore. And he was extremely famous. Bits of his body after he died would kind of materialise like

00:31:03.680 --> 00:31:11.280
 holy relics. So there were nine authentic hooves of his turn into ink stands. Now if he did actually

00:31:11.280 --> 00:31:21.840
 have nine legs and that could explain why he kept winning these races. Okay that is it. That is all

00:31:21.840 --> 00:31:25.920
