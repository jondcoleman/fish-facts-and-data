00:00:00,00:00:20,"""Hello and welcome to another episode of no such thing as a fish, a weekly podcast coming"
00:00:20,00:00:23,to you from the QI offices in Covenant Garden.
00:00:23,00:00:28,"My name is Dan Schreiber, I am sitting here with James Harkin, Andrew Hunter Murray, and"
00:00:28,00:00:32,"Anna Chazinski, and once again we have gathered around the microphones with our four favorite"
00:00:32,00:00:38,"facts from the last seven days, and in no particular order, here we go."
00:00:38,00:00:42,"Starting with back number one, and that's you, Anna."""
00:00:42,00:00:46,My fact this week is that Harvard Business School recommends companies locate their headquarters
00:00:46,00:00:53,"in rainier places because it makes employees more productive, and that's why I are out"
00:00:53,00:00:59,"of it so massive here. This actually goes against what people think, so as part of the"
00:00:59,00:01:04,"same study or a similar one, they asked people what they thought, what effect they thought"
00:01:04,00:01:08,bad weather would have on productivity. 80% of people said they thought it would decrease
00:01:08,00:01:12,"it. Turned out, they did this big study in a Tokyo bank, and they found that employees"
00:01:12,00:01:17,"processed loan applications much faster, so that's something that requires a lot of focus"
00:01:17,00:01:22,"and concentration, much faster and more quickly on rainy days than sunny ones. And it was"
00:01:22,00:01:26,"because when they investigated it, that nice weather causes more cognitive distractions,"
00:01:26,00:01:30,"i.e. people sit in their offices, fantasising about what else they could be doing."
00:01:30,00:01:34,"Yeah, the work tell is the effect is so great that if it's a sunny day versus when it's"
00:01:34,00:01:40,"rainy, that $937,000 is what they would have made if it was continuously rainy, basically."
00:01:40,00:01:44,"This is particular. Yeah, this bank depends on the size of the business. It's not that"
00:01:44,00:01:47,you could have a nice green van and you would make a million quid.
00:01:47,00:01:53,"It's actually not when it rains. I'm thinking in actual fact, ice cream vans is one of the"
00:01:53,00:01:58,"few businesses where sun is better. Well, this doesn't all go well for my wealth chain"
00:01:58,00:02:02,"of ice cream vans, does it? But weirdly, my sister and brother-in-law had, they've just"
00:02:02,00:02:07,"left Abu Dhabi, but they had an ice cream business out there as a side business, and it was"
00:02:07,00:02:12,"a little ice cream shop by the beach, and they couldn't operate it in summer. It's so hot"
00:02:12,00:02:16,"in Abu Dhabi, it can only function in the winter. What's it all about? Yeah, it's just"
00:02:16,00:02:20,"too hot outside, it gets up to 50. But is it that people don't really go outside? Yeah, yeah."
00:02:20,00:02:25,"Right. So it's not like the ice cream melts. Well, that's not like if you buy an ice cream"
00:02:25,00:02:34,"instantly vaporizes. I demand another. Where is this one? One thing I found is, so this"
00:02:34,00:02:39,"was from the same article that this came from, which is, I really like this, Campbell Soup,"
00:02:39,00:02:44,"that company, they advertise based on the weather. So when the weather is bad, in particular"
00:02:44,00:02:49,"cities, they buy more advertising space, because they know that people will want cozy warming"
00:02:49,00:02:54,"food. That's a great idea. It's a nice, thick, country vegetable soup on cold days. Exactly."
00:02:54,00:02:59,And maybe a light broth. It's on some gasp that show on a hot day. It's in a mis-device
00:02:59,00:03:04,"cream. That's really it. It's weird, it's so cool. When it's cold and everyone has"
00:03:04,00:03:08,"flu, they could have chicken soup, because everyone likes it. They have a flu index as"
00:03:08,00:03:11,"well. Do they? Yeah, so they made, yeah, they made a thing. So the thing Andy's talking"
00:03:11,00:03:15,"about, it's called the misery index. For them, it's actually a happiness index, because"
00:03:15,00:03:23,"it means more sales. And when the misery index goes up by 5%, then they queue a chicken soup"
00:03:23,00:03:26,"out of it on the radio. And then that was so successful, they've got a flu index now. So"
00:03:26,00:03:32,as soon as there's a flu outbreak. That's crazy. They must be praying for Spanish flu
00:03:32,00:03:38,"to come back. They're not evil. No, you're right. They're just selling soup. You know,"
00:03:38,00:03:43,"if it's very rainy, there's what type of business it's actually good for. Umbrella's ponchos."
00:03:43,00:03:50,"Yeah. Oh, I've opened up. People take photographs of puddles. The three main rain-based"
00:03:50,00:03:58,businesses. I ran out after two. You make a million more dollars a year if you take photographs
00:03:58,00:04:04,of puddles in the rain. Newspaper editors all over. Get me some puddle
00:04:04,00:04:14,"dust. I was actually talking post rain. Oh, and to dry to dry to dry things. How's"
00:04:14,00:04:20,"the good? Yeah, no helicopter businesses do very well, particularly for orchards, because"
00:04:20,00:04:24,"it when there's huge amount of rainfall, certain things, certain vegetables, certain grapes"
00:04:24,00:04:28,get so saturated that they need to get the water out immediately. So they hire helicopters
00:04:28,00:04:33,in and cherry orchards will have helicopters just hovering over them and drying off all
00:04:33,00:04:39,of the grounds to get it back on the road. It's really cool. The helicopter business. Do
00:04:39,00:04:43,you know the kind of weather that one study found is the only type of weather that really
00:04:43,00:04:49,has an impact on your mood? I can give you the weather categories or do you want to make
00:04:49,00:04:55,"a good one? No, no. The early earth is hit by a meteorite and this rain of metal falling"
00:04:55,00:04:58,from the sky. Firestorms. People don't mind at all. They just go about
00:04:58,00:05:05,"that day. We're very stupid. Okay, give us some options. So this is a study in the 1980s"
00:05:05,00:05:09,and it found the best predictor of mood was in a certain type of weather. The options
00:05:09,00:05:16,"are that they looked at sunniness, temperature, raininess, wind, humidity and... This is not"
00:05:16,00:05:20,going to be the last one. It's not the last one. Can I bet on the last one? Can I bet
00:05:20,00:05:24,"that it is the last one, which I think is missed? Because I think missed always affects"
00:05:24,00:05:31,"my mood very much. This makes me feel spooky. Yeah, you look low. You can't see anything."
00:05:31,00:05:34,It's a bit spooky. That's true. It's quite exciting. You feel like you're in a Victorian
00:05:34,00:05:40,novel. That's the main effect that I think. I'm going to say it's wind because it makes
00:05:40,00:05:47,me feel more agitated because the molecules around me are still agitated. They kind of
00:05:47,00:05:51,somehow make me feel a bit imagine. I think it's got to be one of these two. I'm going
00:05:51,00:05:57,for sunniness. Sunniness makes me a dickhead. It's why I have to leave Australia. I was
00:05:57,00:06:01,"a right asshole over there, but now I'm sort of a bit more calm. But I get in a horrible"
00:06:01,00:06:05,"mood when it's way too hot. Do you? Oh no, so you're not talking about sunniness. You're"
00:06:05,00:06:09,"talking about temperature. Oh yeah. Right? Because it can be sunny. It's sunny today, for"
00:06:09,00:06:12,"instance. It's a beautiful sunny day today. That's true. Okay, so he has been a bit of an"
00:06:12,00:06:18,"asshole today. I do explain that. It's just being a bit of a tricky day. Okay, so yeah."
00:06:18,00:06:22,So why? You've listed almost all the things except the one that it is. Humidity was found
00:06:22,00:06:26,to be the only one has a significant impact on activity and mood and it's because people
00:06:26,00:06:30,"feel very sleepy and they can't concentrate. Which is true, right? When you go to a humid"
00:06:30,00:06:35,"place, you feel really gross. So I grew up in Hong Kong, which was all humid all the"
00:06:35,00:06:39,time. I guess it's established. You're always a dickhead now. I've never thought how this
00:06:39,00:06:44,weather is really molded me. Did you find your concentration improved when you came
00:06:44,00:06:52,"here? Mate, I'm not the good case study to ask about. The wettest day of the year on Earth,"
00:06:52,00:06:57,"whatever day it is, what percentage of the rain from the year do you think falls on that"
00:06:57,00:07:03,"one day? Okay, so if there are 365 days, it would be a bit less than 0.3% on an average"
00:07:03,00:07:14,day. So I'll say 1% triple the average. I'm going to say 35%. Love it. Love great. They
00:07:14,00:07:25,have the puddle for top. He's a billionaire. It is 8.3%. That's about 12 of the Earth's rain
00:07:25,00:07:29,"falls on a single day. What day is that? Well, we don't know. It's different. Surely that's"
00:07:29,00:07:35,"one day we would definitely know. It's the same day every year. Oh yeah, right. I met"
00:07:35,00:07:43,when was the last time that we know it's always the third Tuesday after Easter. And 50% of
00:07:43,00:07:48,"the Earth's precipitation falls on the 12 wettest days of the year. Wow, amazing. Isn't"
00:07:48,00:07:53,that amazing? That's incredible. Wow. That's really cool. It'd be so great if it was the
00:07:53,00:07:58,"same every year. And we could just do a 12 day. What was it, 12 days? 12 day. 12 day long"
00:07:58,00:08:02,hibernation. I wonder if it happens in a period of the year because lots of countries
00:08:02,00:08:07,"have big rainy seasons. So there must be a likelihood of it being... Well, the paper,"
00:08:07,00:08:12,"the article where I read this, it said, ""One key question the researchers wrote is when"
00:08:12,00:08:16,"during the year these extreme precipitation events are likely to occur."" So I think basically"
00:08:16,00:08:20,"they don't really know when it's going to be, but they'll try and work it out. Just on rainy"
00:08:20,00:08:25,"conditions as in preparing for rain, have you heard of the rain shader? No. This is a new"
00:08:25,00:08:29,"kind of umbrella, which has been invented in the last few years, and it is designed to"
00:08:29,00:08:34,solve the problems of... What are the problems of umbrellas? They're getting people's eyes.
00:08:34,00:08:38,"They're getting people's eyes. Inside out. Oh yeah, that is one actually. That's the main"
00:08:38,00:08:41,one. That's a really good one. And there's one more. You never have one on you when you
00:08:41,00:08:47,"need it. That's not the one I'm looking for. They break the... No, people take them if you leave"
00:08:47,00:08:52,"them at the front of a store. If it's really windy, you might blow away like Mary Poppins."
00:08:52,00:08:57,"Yeah, that's... She doesn't... Have you seen this little... She's not trying to help them out"
00:08:57,00:09:02,"and suddenly again, so she's blown away into the land. It's one of the sequels only 17 minutes"
00:09:02,00:09:11,"long, very sad. Yeah, opening lines were... Sorry about that. Where were we? No, it's that you know"
00:09:11,00:09:15,"when you tilt it, all the water can fall off onto someone else. I'll cut it. That's a small"
00:09:15,00:09:24,"problem. I'll hold it upside down, but you can... What? So the rain shader is this new... It"
00:09:24,00:09:29,"basically looks like a motorbike helmet, but in umbrella form, so it's open at the front"
00:09:29,00:09:34,"and then at the back, it's really low. It's like wearing a big helmet that sort of cut out"
00:09:34,00:09:38,"at the front, so that means you can't ever poke someone in the eye with it. That's really good."
00:09:38,00:09:41,"That's good. I don't think that would turn inside out either, so I think it's solving more"
00:09:41,00:09:48,"problems and... I think it might. Yeah. Yeah. In Harvard Business School, there's a paper"
00:09:48,00:09:53,"that they wrote quite recently called Toxic Workers, and this is about superstar workers"
00:09:53,00:10:00,"who outperform their colleagues by two to one or more, but who are awful to be around. And"
00:10:00,00:10:04,"they want to work out whether it's useful to have these kind of amazing workers, or whether"
00:10:04,00:10:09,they do way too much harm than good. What do you think? Interesting. What do we think of James?
00:10:09,00:10:19,"The question we're being asked to. Apparently according to them, it's better to hire two"
00:10:19,00:10:24,average employees than to keep one superstar long-tailed payroll. Do you guys know about the...
00:10:24,00:10:29,"This has always been one of my favourite studies, the Harvard Grant Study, which is this massive,"
00:10:29,00:10:37,"it's famous, longitudinal study, and it's followed 268 people for 80 years, so it started following"
00:10:37,00:10:42,"them when they were at Harvard, and it studies every tiny aspect of their lives. And so it's told us"
00:10:42,00:10:47,"so much about the decisions that you make and the personalities that you have, what impact that"
00:10:47,00:10:52,"has on your life. It's like an unbelievable level of detail, so it measures things like the"
00:10:52,00:10:57,"side of molds on their body, and how many teaspoons of sugar they have in their tea, and the hanging"
00:10:57,00:11:04,"length of your scrotum, and then they sort of follow them, and they hang length, guys. As opposed to"
00:11:04,00:11:19,"when you've got it pinned back. So they measure all this, and they find out, you know, they successful,"
00:11:19,00:11:24,"as you JFK was one of the people who was originally in it, so he was successful, but actually quite unlucky."
00:11:24,00:11:31,"And at the moment, I think there are only about, not many of them left now, obviously I think there"
00:11:31,00:11:35,"were 19 left a couple of years ago. But it's all the ones with the longest scrotums, and that's the"
00:11:35,00:11:39,"interesting thing. And if that was true, is the sole predictor of how you do it, though? No, because"
00:11:39,00:11:44,"they all chipped over and concussed themselves years ago. What they basically have found, or what the"
00:11:44,00:11:50,person who's in charge of it now says is the most important discovery is that your relationships
00:11:50,00:11:54,"are the most important predictor of health, mental and physical, but literally the most important,"
00:11:54,00:11:59,"more important than cholesterol, more important than diet, it's, you know, the warmth of your"
00:11:59,00:12:04,"relationships, and that dictates how much you'll earn in the end, and it dictates how successful"
00:12:04,00:12:09,"you'll be, and how happy you'll be. There we go. Or it could just be that rich people can buy"
00:12:09,00:12:14,"relationships. Yeah. Yeah, I think it's that."
00:12:14,00:12:25,"Okay, it is time for fact number two, and that is Andy. My effect is that when they are meeting,"
00:12:25,00:12:30,"male cuttlefish can flirt with one side of their body, and simultaneously pretend to be a female"
00:12:30,00:12:36,"with the other side of their body. It's a really weird thing they do. So, cuttlefish,"
00:12:36,00:12:42,"mollusks in the ocean are kind of mollusk, and they're a bit squid-y and a bit octopussy, and"
00:12:42,00:12:49,"they change the pattern of the skin all the time for camouflage, but they do it for lots of"
00:12:49,00:12:52,"different reasons, so they might do it to avoid predators, or they sometimes do it even to catch"
00:12:52,00:12:58,"prey. But one thing they do is when they're courting, male cuttlefish display, you know,"
00:12:58,00:13:04,"courtship patterns to females on their bodies, but they don't want other males to fight them. So,"
00:13:04,00:13:10,they simultaneously make the back half of their body display a female pattern. So a male who's
00:13:10,00:13:15,"standing behind the flirting male will think, ""Oh, that's just two female cuttlefish having a chat"
00:13:15,00:13:20,"with each other,"" and he won't get in the way. But if it looks like it's a male chatting to a female,"
00:13:20,00:13:24,they might try and break it up. But is there no chance that the male cuttlefish will start
00:13:24,00:13:29,"flirting with the back of the female camouflage? That sometimes happens. Yeah, because that"
00:13:29,00:13:39,"would just be a long cue. Basically, yeah, that does happen. So, some males have harems of females,"
00:13:39,00:13:43,"which they guard, jealously, from challenges, and other males disguise themselves to look female,"
00:13:43,00:13:47,"sneak in, have sex with the real females and then sneak out. But sometimes the disguised males"
00:13:47,00:13:54,"look so good that the alpha male will guard him as part of his harem. So, you can have a harem which"
00:13:54,00:13:58,has mostly males in it. That's amazing. I'm going to see all pretending to be females. But they only
00:13:58,00:14:02,"look good from the back, so they're just never going around the front. They're just strictly"
00:14:02,00:14:09,"ass-based differences. They are amazing. They're incredible. They also have two prehensile tentacles,"
00:14:09,00:14:15,"I think, on the front, which sometimes they hide. They've got pockets under their eyes where they"
00:14:15,00:14:24,"put them when they're not using them. So, such a great place to have a pocket. They're so weird."
00:14:24,00:14:28,"It's so weird when you don't, because octopuses, I think, we all know, are quite weird. So, when"
00:14:28,00:14:32,"you talk about them, it's kind of, but this is all just like, what is this animal? Are we just joking?"
00:14:32,00:14:36,"Are we lying? It's got pockets under its eyes, turns its butt into a woman. Come on."
00:14:36,00:14:40,"The most amazing thing about a cuttlefish, which people maybe know, and David Atmer is very good at"
00:14:40,00:14:44,"showing, is that their disguise is right. So, they disguise themselves even better than, you know,"
00:14:44,00:14:48,"the octopuses that can do it and other things, and they can do it within a few milliseconds. They can"
00:14:48,00:14:53,"just change colour and they can give themselves stripes, like you say, kind of caulting patterns."
00:14:53,00:14:58,"It is incredible. They can, as well as change in the colour, they can change from smooth to bumpy"
00:14:58,00:15:05,"the skin, which is a really cool idea. So, they mimic the object that they might be camouflaging"
00:15:05,00:15:08,"themselves on. But not just colour, but also the texture. Yeah, the texture. It's like, I'll bring"
00:15:08,00:15:16,"yourself in warts, something like that. If you want to pretend to be a witch. A lot of those on the"
00:15:16,00:15:21,bottom of the object. Yeah. I read it as they have the equivalent of hundreds of cocktail umbrellas
00:15:21,00:15:26,"under their skin. So, they have all these structures that they can sort of lock upright to make"
00:15:26,00:15:32,"themselves look nobily, basically, if they want to look like coral. Yeah, for example. And that camouflage,"
00:15:32,00:15:36,"they can freeze it and lock it in place for up to an hour. So, they change it all the time,"
00:15:36,00:15:41,"but they can just go, okay, I'm going to stay like this for an hour now. Wow. They are really weird"
00:15:41,00:15:46,"and really cool. That's crazy. And also, these changes are to do with their mood and whether they're"
00:15:46,00:15:50,"hungry or scared or whatever. So, you can look at the colours on a cuttlefish and work out what it's"
00:15:50,00:15:57,"feeling. That'll be useful in humans. Oh, good. They can do a chessboard pattern. They can. They can,"
00:15:57,00:16:02,they can make themselves look exactly like a chessboard. Why? For when they need a camouflage next to a
00:16:02,00:16:08,"game of chess going right now. Because they can do the bumping stuff as well. Well, so, you're saying"
00:16:08,00:16:15,they can do the pieces. They can have an actual game on their own body. That would be amazing. That's
00:16:15,00:16:21,"very good. So, can you explain the chessboard thing? Why would they do that? Well, they they've been"
00:16:21,00:16:26,"tested by scientists. There's no natural chessboard pattern, but it's just to show how versatile they are."
00:16:26,00:16:30,"That's incredible. So, they can, oh yeah, yeah. And they can, Richard Hammond, who used to be on"
00:16:30,00:16:37,"top gear. He could also do that. But terribly sadly, he doesn't know the rules."
00:16:37,00:16:44,"It's a show, real shame. No, he is one of his shows. They put a cuttlefish in an underwater lounge,"
00:16:44,00:16:48,"which they mocked up, which had all sort of like a zebra pattern sofa and stuff. They were just"
00:16:48,00:16:53,"putting it to my face. And that was in Richard Hammond's house, did you say or? No, sorry,"
00:16:53,00:17:00,how does he come into this? He was making a show and it was about cool animals or something and
00:17:01,00:17:07,it featured an underwater lounge with all this stuff. Richard Hammond's lounge is not underwater.
00:17:07,00:17:15,"And so, okay, so they perfectly mimicked the chessboard. That is so cool. It's really bizarre."
00:17:15,00:17:20,"Yeah. I mean, it wouldn't be perfect. I don't get excited. No, but I mean, I'm actually more"
00:17:20,00:17:25,excited by the experiment that we are taking non underwater based objects and seeing if they can
00:17:25,00:17:29,"mimic that because you wouldn't naturally see that. Yeah, I'm interested that they can, I didn't"
00:17:29,00:17:32,realise they can actually mimic stuff that they'd never seen before. There might be half a dozen
00:17:32,00:17:37,cuttlefish in this room now. We don't know. This entire building is half a fish. I throw a top to
00:17:37,00:17:44,bottom. My favourite cuttlefish is the bottom dwelling flamboyant cuttlefish. We'll say that again.
00:17:44,00:17:48,"The bottom dwelling flamboyant cuttlefish. God, if you've got something dwelling in your bottom,"
00:17:48,00:17:55,"you don't want it to be flamboyant, right? It's the only mollusk with a quadrepedal gate."
00:17:55,00:17:59,"That's amazing. Yeah, that is incredible. The way they hunt is cool, so they've"
00:17:59,00:18:03,"got, if you look at them, they look exactly like the oods from Doctor Who, and I know only"
00:18:03,00:18:06,"Dan when I know what I'm talking about, but that's what a lot of them look like, so they've got"
00:18:06,00:18:11,"these sort of big long funnels on their nose, and the way they, a lot of them catch prey,"
00:18:11,00:18:15,"is by blasting their funnel at the sand, and they'll blow up a prawn that's having a nap."
00:18:15,00:18:23,"They just shoots up into their prawns. I suppose they must do, right? If I was going to nap,"
00:18:23,00:18:27,"yeah. They hunt in the day and prawns are not turned on, so they're often asleep in the day."
00:18:28,00:18:33,"What a horrible way to wake up being blasted after you're there, into the mouth of a nude."
00:18:33,00:18:38,"One thing about cuttlefish, there might also be known as they give us sepia, they give us basically"
00:18:38,00:18:44,"the look of Victorian photographs. What? Yeah, sepia ink, so they have an ink sack in it."
00:18:44,00:18:46,There are three things that develop when they're in embryo. The first three things develop
00:18:46,00:18:51,"are their two eyes, weird shaped eyes, and then their ink sack, and that's a defense mechanism,"
00:18:51,00:18:55,"so they blast out ink as a last resort if they're being chased, and that's where we get sepia,"
00:18:55,00:18:59,"it's our main source of that colour. Wait for the day, or the original..."
00:18:59,00:19:03,"Wow, that's amazing. Six years like that browny colour, isn't it?"
00:19:03,00:19:06,Yeah. Yeah. You put over photographs to make them look...
00:19:06,00:19:12,"That's sort of a Victorian... Yeah, but wait, sorry, did that get used in the Victorian photo process?"
00:19:12,00:19:17,"We needed cuttlefish ink. Yeah. That's incredible. Yeah, that's amazing."
00:19:17,00:19:20,"They're a handy, handy little guy. You just wouldn't think there would be enough"
00:19:20,00:19:24,cuttlefish to make enough sepia for the Victorian photo industry.
00:19:24,00:19:28,"There's so much cuttlefish. And also, probably wasn't that bigger"
00:19:28,00:19:30,"industry in those days. Oh yeah. It's not like mobile phones,"
00:19:30,00:19:33,"where everyone's got a camera these days. That's true, just the rich people."
00:19:33,00:19:37,"Anyone could be a puddle photographer these days, but all the art has been lost from the trade."
00:19:37,00:19:42,"And it's not like every time you put a sepia filter over your iPhone photo,"
00:19:42,00:19:49,a cuttlefish has to die. We've moved on. There's no like when you go to snappy snappes huge tank
00:19:49,00:20:02,"for the cuttlefish. Okay, it's time for fact number three, and that is James."
00:20:02,00:20:07,"Okay, my fact this week is that William of Orange's favourite drink was cock ale."
00:20:07,00:20:16,"Which was? Which was a drink? It's made of ale with a cock in it, a cockerel, a rooster."
00:20:17,00:20:23,"And it was, they put the rooster in when it was being brewed. And the idea was that it would put"
00:20:23,00:20:28,"something into the mix, which would give you virility. And it was like the red bull of its day,"
00:20:28,00:20:37,almost. And actually the first known recipe for cock ale was in 1669. And it was written by a guy
00:20:37,00:20:43,"called Sir Kennellm Digby, who people who know the podcast might remember his father. You ever"
00:20:43,00:20:50,"had a ride, Digby, who was one of the gunpowder platters. All the makes of return. This is so exciting."
00:20:50,00:20:58,"So Kennellm Digby, he wrote a lot of like cookbooks and he invented bacon and eggs as well, actually."
00:20:58,00:21:04,"Sorry, I think we give pigs a lot of the credit for bacon and chickens, the credit for eggs."
00:21:04,00:21:08,You're right. He just invented putting them together. I don't think so. I think if we cooked in a
00:21:08,00:21:15,"me, for example, I wouldn't be able to claim credit for the recipe. Yeah. Sorry enough, the recipe"
00:21:15,00:21:20,"of this take eight gallons of ale, take a cock and boil him well, then take four pounds of raisins"
00:21:20,00:21:25,"of the sun well stones, two or three nutmegs, three or four flakes of mace, half a pound of dates,"
00:21:25,00:21:31,"be told these were the mortar and put them in two quarts of the best sack, then what sack is."
00:21:31,00:21:35,"And then when the ale have done working, put these in and stop it close six or seven days and then"
00:21:35,00:21:42,"bottle it. And after a month, you may drink it. So it's a bit like a mold cocktail. Yeah. I think"
00:21:42,00:21:47,"sack is kind of wine. I think like maybe fortified wine. I'm not sure. Well, there is a theory,"
00:21:47,00:21:52,which is a terrible theory. It can't be right. But I know what you're going to say over the theory.
00:21:52,00:21:58,"Yeah, because they were adding this new element ingredient to something that shouldn't be there."
00:21:58,00:22:05,Cock ale was effectively the origins of cocktail. It's just not true. I'm saying it's a theory.
00:22:05,00:22:10,"Where do you think it came from then cocktail? Oh, there are different, I can't remember. There"
00:22:10,00:22:16,are other bad theories as well. But that's worth. Here's another bad theory. So a cocktail used to be
00:22:16,00:22:23,a horse with a docked tail because it looked a bit like a Cox comb. And then it became a word for a
00:22:23,00:22:28,horse of a mixed pedigree. And then it became a drink because it had lots of mixes of different drinks
00:22:28,00:22:34,"in it. That's one theory. And HL Menken thought that it came from the French coquettier, meaning egg"
00:22:34,00:22:39,"cup, because you would drink it out of a very small cocktail. Oh, I like that one. That's my"
00:22:39,00:22:44,favorite so far. I think none of them are true. Yeah. I can't believe we know who made bacon and
00:22:44,00:22:48,"eggs for the first time. I'm sorry, I've just kind of danced over that, but that's huge. That's a big deal."
00:22:48,00:22:53,That's a big deal. As someone else probably would have done it. And actually he was just writing down
00:22:53,00:22:58,"recipes, right? So, right. He didn't invent. I don't think he invented cock ale either. I think he"
00:22:58,00:23:04,"just wrote it down. Okay. The recipes were simpler then, weren't they? He just wrote bacon eggs. And"
00:23:04,00:23:09,"he went down in history. No, they're really complicated lots of them. So there's a 1739"
00:23:09,00:23:14,"cock ale recipe in a book called The Complete Housewife, which was one of the first big household manuals."
00:23:14,00:23:19,"And it starts with take 10 gallons of ale and a large cock, the older the better. But then you had"
00:23:19,00:23:24,"to stamp on it in a mortar until it was, it's bones were broken. It said parboiled the cock,"
00:23:24,00:23:31,flay it and stamp him in a stone mortar. Yeah. My mortar is not big enough to be stamping around it.
00:23:31,00:23:39,"Need a bigger mortar. Another weird ingredient for old drinks, cider in the 16th century used to have"
00:23:39,00:23:44,sheep's blood added to it. Cornwall sheep's blood. What do at what point they realize that it's
00:23:44,00:23:50,just nicer without the sheep's blood. One day they'd run out of sheep's blood and they just made
00:23:50,00:23:57,cider. You were laughed out of the pub if you suggested. Do you think we could? Yeah. So the sort of
00:23:57,00:24:03,precursors to beer seem to all have been mold spice beer. I think our kind of beer that doesn't contain
00:24:03,00:24:09,any spices and flavours is the anomaly in history really. So you see all these recipes for kind of
00:24:09,00:24:15,heating up beer. They always were adding cinnamon and cloves and nutmeg and ginger. Another thing they
00:24:15,00:24:20,"added, almost always, if you look back to beer recipes, if you look in old books and stuff or from"
00:24:20,00:24:26,"the 16 1700s toast. So they always put toast on top of beer, didn't they? Flowsed it. Yeah. So they'll say like,"
00:24:26,00:24:34,"you know, like a crouton in a soup basically. Yeah, like giant croutons. I'd like a crouton."
00:24:34,00:24:38,"In a bit. Well, I like beer and I like croutons. There we go. Seems likely that I would like both"
00:24:38,00:24:43,"these six. I think you'd love the 16 hundreds. It's hard though, isn't it? To most beer glasses,"
00:24:43,00:24:48,"most points are not quite big enough for a full slice of toast to float on the surface. No, but these"
00:24:48,00:24:54,beers were fitting entire roosters in them. So the vessels were bigger. What was the point of the toast?
00:24:54,00:25:00,"Well, one recipe I read explained why the toast was there. It said, it claps the white"
00:25:00,00:25:04,"waistcoat on a cup of good drink. Oh, brilliant. That's pretty good. I think that's great."
00:25:04,00:25:11,"Right. Oh, yeah. The white waistcoat. Oh, wow. Yeah. Yeah. I've just done that."
00:25:11,00:25:17,I was reading about just the consumption of alcohol in the 16 hundreds and I found this thing
00:25:17,00:25:23,that Parliament passed was an act that I'd not heard of. It was the act to repress the odious and
00:25:23,00:25:29,"loathsome sin of drunkenness, because everyone was just getting so drunk all the time. But the wording"
00:25:29,00:25:36,"of that is just stunning. Yeah. Adios. Yeah. So, yeah. So hops, which were medicinal plants,"
00:25:36,00:25:41,they'd been added to beers and I think that was a way around of saying that you were doing
00:25:41,00:25:47,"for medical purposes as opposed to it being just getting drunk. Oh, yeah. They didn't like hops in"
00:25:47,00:25:50,"Britain. They really didn't like hops. So, when we talk about beer from thousands of years ago,"
00:25:50,00:25:55,"it's not beer like we know. So, beer to be classified as beer now has to be made with hops."
00:25:55,00:26:00,"But they only actually came to England in the 1400s, I think, from the Netherlands and everyone"
00:26:00,00:26:04,"thought they were a bit poisonous and they were a bit weird. So, that's, you know, it's the plant"
00:26:04,00:26:09,"that adds the bitter taste to beer. Right. And actually, the first person to describe hops"
00:26:09,00:26:15,scientifically and talk about how they were used in beer was a woman. It was a Christian botanist
00:26:15,00:26:23,and Abbas who is called Hildegard of Bingen. I've heard of her actually. Yeah. She was a big deal.
00:26:23,00:26:28,"Yeah. She was quite revolutionary in the beer industry. Did she see lots of, oh, I can't remember"
00:26:28,00:26:34,"what about her now. I think she saw lots of visions and stuff, didn't she? It's not the same Hildegard."
00:26:34,00:26:40,"Oh, maybe not. Is the more than one Hildegard. Oh, no. It can't be that many. There was one"
00:26:40,00:26:46,"who saw lots of visions and then wrote one of the first books or something, but maybe it was a different"
00:26:46,00:26:50,"one. No, it might have been her. She was big. She wasn't actually a fan of hops even though she knew"
00:26:50,00:26:55,how they were used. She said they make the soul of man sad and way down his inner organs. Whoa.
00:26:55,00:27:03,That's kind of what it feels like after seven fights. There is a thing I can't remember exactly
00:27:03,00:27:07,"what it is, but in Germany, you're only allowed three ingredients in beer to this day. Really?"
00:27:07,00:27:13,"I think it's hops, water, and what would it be? Barley? Barley here. And I think it's really strict."
00:27:13,00:27:17,And they've had hundreds and hundreds of years of rules about this. So there was the Brow
00:27:17,00:27:23,"Ordnung in 16th century Bavaria, where you weren't allowed to make beer between the 23rd of April"
00:27:23,00:27:29,"and 29th of September. So no brewing allowed, because breweries caught fire very easily because"
00:27:29,00:27:34,they were all made of wood and there were lots of coal fires to heat them up. So it was bad for
00:27:34,00:27:41,"fire, so they banned it. But you had to have sellers to store beer from the winter so that you could"
00:27:41,00:27:47,drink it in the summer. And the breweries stored them in big underground sellers. And then above
00:27:47,00:27:52,ground they planted trees to keep them shady because they wanted to keep the cool in the sellers.
00:27:52,00:27:58,And then they started adding tables and gravel to these above ground tree areas. And that's the
00:27:58,00:28:06,"beginning of the beer garden. So yeah, the beer garden comes from this band on brewing in the summer."
00:28:06,00:28:10,"And it was actually four beer, really, the beer garden, not for us."
00:28:10,00:28:15,"Where is what else is garden, right?"
00:28:15,00:28:21,"Better than the beer. So just speaking of German beer, you know, Pilsner,"
00:28:21,00:28:25,so where that name comes from. I thought it was a place or something.
00:28:25,00:28:32,"So it is a place, it's from Pilsen, which is one of Europe's first beer brewing capitals."
00:28:32,00:28:37,"And Pilsen, it was called Pilsen when it became this beer brewing capitol. And that is because"
00:28:37,00:28:42,"that was the German word for henbane, which is like a really deadly poisonous plant,"
00:28:42,00:28:46,but they used to put that in beer all the time. So they were brew beer with henbane because I
00:28:46,00:28:50,"don't make it really, I mean, that is really complicated. Poisonous. Yeah, it's very dangerous."
00:28:50,00:28:54,What was they doing with beer for hundreds of years? Let's put cockles in it. Let's put sheep's
00:28:54,00:29:00,"flooded in poison. There was no, they went and they went three ingredients. That's it for that one."
00:29:00,00:29:07,"But a little bit of poison, no, no. It gave you hallucinations. If you managed to escape death,"
00:29:07,00:29:11,"it was quite fun. But so that's where Pilsner comes from is after henbane, because that was a"
00:29:11,00:29:19,"crucial ingredient of deadly beer. Wow, very cool. Just one last weird origin thing. So you mentioned"
00:29:19,00:29:24,that beer brewing book. You mentioned that beer brewing book was for a housewife. Beer brewing was
00:29:24,00:29:30,"sort of solely a women's thing across the world, wherever beer was brewed until pretty recently,"
00:29:30,00:29:36,"until basically the 15, 1600s when hops actually came in. So the ale wife is a thing because it was"
00:29:36,00:29:40,always the woman who would do the cooking beer in the house brewing the beer. Women would control
00:29:40,00:29:44,"the breweries. For instance, in ancient Egypt, they all had their own breweries. Women were being"
00:29:44,00:29:50,in charge and so they became the main beer sellers and barmaid still in sort of de-cendian novels.
00:29:50,00:29:56,So women would start making surplus beer because they'd been making it for the home and then they
00:29:56,00:30:01,would go and sell it. So they'd put greenery over their doors and in some cases they'd put a broom
00:30:01,00:30:05,up against their door which signified that you were selling beer and they would stand on the corner
00:30:05,00:30:13,and they'd advertise their beer by wearing a tall hat and they would often have a pet cat
00:30:13,00:30:24,"who would chase the pets away. Well, it's a theory. This is where the witch image comes from."
00:30:24,00:30:29,"Yeah, so there were tall hats that I'm the beer selling lady. I'm the ale wife. And they all had cats."
00:30:29,00:30:32,They had a cat to chase away pests because otherwise they ate the grain with which they made the beer.
00:30:32,00:30:36,"They were all testing out crazy ingredients like eye of newt instead. Yeah,"
00:30:36,00:30:42,"they were testing things. Yeah, they're literally a genic. They go stirring it around in their cauldrons."
00:30:42,00:30:51,"All their massive mortars. Yes. Oh my goodness. And then came the witch. Really? Wow. Yeah, it's a thought"
00:30:51,00:31:03,"that I haven't made up. Okay, it is time for our final fact of the show and that is my fact."
00:31:03,00:31:09,My fact this week is that after five months of forensically analyzing the indents made by a pen on
00:31:09,00:31:15,"paper, Dorset Police managed to recover 26 pages of lost words by a blind novelist who hadn't"
00:31:15,00:31:22,"realized that her pen had run out of ink. That is quite remarkable. Yeah, it's pretty extraordinary."
00:31:22,00:31:27,This was an author called Trish Vickers. It was her first book that she was writing. She had gone
00:31:27,00:31:33,blind through diabetes and she decided that she wanted to pass her time by writing a book. So she
00:31:33,00:31:38,"created a system and she did it long hand with pen, created a system where she had elastic bands"
00:31:38,00:31:42,along the paper. She would write out the pages and then her son would come at the end of the week and
00:31:42,00:31:48,he would transcribe them onto a word document or whatever he chose. So he came one week after she
00:31:48,00:31:53,"had this burst of inspiration. She wrote 26 pages, but he discovered these blank pages sitting there."
00:31:53,00:31:58,Turns out the pen had run out. She was devastated. He was devastated because she'd written such great
00:31:58,00:32:04,"stuff. And it is quite funny. And it's incredibly funny. Thank you, James, for pointing that out."
00:32:04,00:32:09,"Yeah, so she was very upset and they're going touch with the police to say can you do anything"
00:32:09,00:32:18,"about this? And yeah, the way they arrested the pen went effective. Yeah, so actually it's"
00:32:18,00:32:23,very sweet at Dorset Police Station. Someone said they would look through the pages with the special
00:32:23,00:32:27,light that they use for forensics to see the little markings that the pen would have left on the
00:32:27,00:32:33,"page, the little dense. And they spent five months now. It wasn't five months of intense analysis."
00:32:33,00:32:37,The burglars in Dorset at the time. We're just having a field day.
00:32:37,00:32:42,"It was, I believe it was one person who did it on her lunch break for five months. Although,"
00:32:42,00:32:45,"if you're a burglar, having a field day is probably a very bad day for you."
00:32:45,00:32:50,Burglar's call it having a house full of electronic equipment day.
00:32:53,00:33:00,"But so she managed to get the book done. It was called Granifer's Legacy. Sadly, she actually passed"
00:33:00,00:33:05,"away before she could hold a physical copy in her hands, but it was published two hours prior to her"
00:33:05,00:33:11,"passing away, the physical copies. So she just missed out by two hours. She knew it was being published."
00:33:11,00:33:17,"She knew, and I think she held a proof in her hand. So yeah, so I thought that the only method,"
00:33:17,00:33:22,"you know, when you make indentations on paper, you can kind of read it or you can shade over it"
00:33:22,00:33:26,"with a pencil and that kind of shows up because it doesn't, the pencil shading doesn't fill the"
00:33:26,00:33:33,"indentations. Do you know the police do it? They have a special wand. So first of all, they don't"
00:33:33,00:33:38,"do the pencil thing, do they? Because that could damage the evidence. Right. But they have this"
00:33:38,00:33:44,device they've invented called an electrostatic detection apparatus. And they basically documents
00:33:44,00:33:48,"which are charged with static, piece of paper charged with static, builds up more charge in the"
00:33:48,00:33:54,"furrows where the pencil is indented, all the pen is indented, then on the flat. And even even"
00:33:54,00:34:00,really microscopic non-visible to the naked eye furrows exist. So they put the document on this plate
00:34:00,00:34:05,and then they pass a wand charged with electricity over it and then they apply this mist of toner and
00:34:05,00:34:12,the toner just gravitates towards the furrows and you fill in a page of writing that way. Wow.
00:34:12,00:34:17,It's basically a magic wand. So they sort of charge up the indentations that have got a lot of
00:34:17,00:34:23,"static in. Yeah, that's cool. Super cool. It's quite similar to fingerprinting, right? That kind of"
00:34:23,00:34:28,process where with fingerprinting you can kind of do it yourself. So apparently a really good
00:34:28,00:34:33,substance for putting over fingerprints so you can see them is raw cocoa powder. If you want to
00:34:33,00:34:38,"do it, you can use raw cocoa powder or talcum powder. But you're not going to have the database of"
00:34:38,00:34:43,"the entire country at home, are you? Are you just going to see a fingerprint that you can't really"
00:34:43,00:34:47,"recognise? Yeah, but you can definitely, if it's like who took my chocolate bar, you can definitely"
00:34:47,00:34:53,"get your family's fingerprints, I reckon, and in your room, and then compare them. It's a real"
00:34:53,00:34:56,"insight into others too. I've heard that. Yeah, definitely would have done that."
00:34:56,00:35:04,"The system, the magic wand system that you talked about is called the Electrostatic Detection"
00:35:04,00:35:13,"Apparatus ESDA, and it was invented by two DJs. Wow. They were called DJ Foster and DJ Marants."
00:35:13,00:35:21,They weren't disc jockeys. It was just their names. I was thinking they were bored in the booth one day.
00:35:21,00:35:25,"No, it's just a coincidence that they had the same two initials and I thought"
00:35:25,00:35:30,it was quite funny. It was a good set up. You had us going in the first half. We did not see it
00:35:30,00:35:36,"coming. I was thinking, that was a pretty boring name for DJs, aren't they? DJ Foster."
00:35:36,00:35:44,"Can I just say one more thing on ESDA? Yeah. ESDA is kind of famous because it's what,"
00:35:44,00:35:50,do you remember the West Midlands series crime squad got into a lot of trouble for faking people's
00:35:50,00:35:57,"confessions, the Birmingham pub bummings? Oh, yeah. They got the Birmingham six. Yeah,"
00:35:57,00:36:02,they got released because of that and it was using ESDA that they found that the police were making
00:36:02,00:36:07,"these fake confessions. Oh, really? Oh, very cool. That's cool. That's cool. That's cool, but true."
00:36:07,00:36:13,"Varmadermid actually has written a book on forensics, which sounds really good. I was reading"
00:36:13,00:36:17,"a summary of it, so she's the, she's a sort of crime writer, isn't she? Of fiction. Yeah,"
00:36:17,00:36:22,"of fiction. But this is a factual book and so there's loads of good facts in there, but there's"
00:36:22,00:36:28,"a story of the arsonist called John Orr, which I didn't know about. He was quite a big criminal"
00:36:28,00:36:34,in the 1980s. He was basically a fireman and who ended up being done for burning down loads and
00:36:34,00:36:39,"loads of houses, because if you're a fireman, you know how? So I think he was suspected in more than"
00:36:39,00:36:46,"a thousand fires in California and he was eventually caught. He was caught partly because of forensics,"
00:36:46,00:36:52,so they matched a fingerprint on one bit of sort of half-burned match that he'd used. Wow. But he was
00:36:52,00:36:58,"also caught. Did you think they went, ""We've got a match?"" And they went, ""Yeah, we can see that."""
00:36:58,00:37:03,So good. There was two hours of confusion there. Between Laurel and Hardy to fire.
00:37:03,00:37:10,"So another thing that tipped him off, he might be responsible, was that he'd written a novel called"
00:37:10,00:37:15,"""Points of Origin"" that contained a highly detailed description of the same fire that they were"
00:37:15,00:37:21,investigating for several striking similarities and also the fire that he was done for in 1984.
00:37:21,00:37:26,"Everyone who investigated it said this is an accidental fire and he kept insisting that no,"
00:37:26,00:37:31,it was arson. So it's like he really had this desire for people to know. Do you think he was one of
00:37:31,00:37:35,these people who deliberately set fires so they can go and put them out? Yeah. He's because that has
00:37:35,00:37:42,happened. We did that. It's called something like hero syndrome. Maybe. What is not a hero now? He is
00:37:42,00:37:50,serving a long jail sentence. Very much a hero. Nice. That's what the judge said when he passed the
00:37:50,00:38:00,zero. I'd love to be one of those comedy judges. Something funny just as a setting them down.
00:38:00,00:38:06,"I didn't know that comedy judge was a career actually. What is not, no, you don't apply to be the"
00:38:06,00:38:12,comedy judge. It is a regular judge who happens to have a bit of fun. There was that guy who got
00:38:12,00:38:18,"done for, he got done for something, but he loved the Beatles and the judge sentenced him using as many"
00:38:18,00:38:26,"Beatles. Oh no, that's so nice. What did he do? What did he say? Maybe he stole from the taxman?"
00:38:26,00:38:30,"Yeah. Brilliant. Yeah. You probably were, it was probably a cry for help. You may have had a hard"
00:38:30,00:38:40,"day's night in your yellow submarine. Wait, it was the criminal affair of the Beatles. Yeah."
00:38:40,00:38:44,"Okay, got it, got it. So it was kind of like the Beatles were sending him down. That is really hard."
00:38:44,00:38:50,"You shouldn't have used your revolver. Yeah, let's go to the big albums. Yeah. You've got a rubber"
00:38:50,00:38:57,"soul. Yeah, because you know, it's like a bad soul. A rubber soul. A rubber soul. A rubber soul is"
00:38:57,00:39:00,"better. A rubber soul. A rubber soul is better. I mean, none of these are good, are they?"
00:39:02,00:39:13,"Love the comedy judges. Okay. Okay, that's it. That is all of our facts. Thank you so much for listening."
