00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:20,060
 "Hello and welcome to another episode of no such thing as a fish, a weekly podcast coming

2
00:00:20,060 --> 00:00:23,220
 to you from the QI offices in Covenant Garden.

3
00:00:23,220 --> 00:00:28,060
 My name is Dan Schreiber, I am sitting here with James Harkin, Andrew Hunter Murray, and

4
00:00:28,060 --> 00:00:32,380
 Anna Chazinski, and once again we have gathered around the microphones with our four favorite

5
00:00:32,380 --> 00:00:38,020
 facts from the last seven days, and in no particular order, here we go.

6
00:00:38,020 --> 00:00:42,020
 Starting with back number one, and that's you, Anna."

7
00:00:42,020 --> 00:00:46,740
 My fact this week is that Harvard Business School recommends companies locate their headquarters

8
00:00:46,740 --> 00:00:53,120
 in rainier places because it makes employees more productive, and that's why I are out

9
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:59,360
 of it so massive here. This actually goes against what people think, so as part of the

10
00:00:59,360 --> 00:01:04,000
 same study or a similar one, they asked people what they thought, what effect they thought

11
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:08,040
 bad weather would have on productivity. 80% of people said they thought it would decrease

12
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:12,800
 it. Turned out, they did this big study in a Tokyo bank, and they found that employees

13
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:17,440
 processed loan applications much faster, so that's something that requires a lot of focus

14
00:01:17,440 --> 00:01:22,240
 and concentration, much faster and more quickly on rainy days than sunny ones. And it was

15
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:26,560
 because when they investigated it, that nice weather causes more cognitive distractions,

16
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:30,520
 i.e. people sit in their offices, fantasising about what else they could be doing.

17
00:01:30,520 --> 00:01:34,280
 Yeah, the work tell is the effect is so great that if it's a sunny day versus when it's

18
00:01:34,280 --> 00:01:40,600
 rainy, that $937,000 is what they would have made if it was continuously rainy, basically.

19
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:44,360
 This is particular. Yeah, this bank depends on the size of the business. It's not that

20
00:01:44,360 --> 00:01:47,080
 you could have a nice green van and you would make a million quid.

21
00:01:47,080 --> 00:01:53,520
 It's actually not when it rains. I'm thinking in actual fact, ice cream vans is one of the

22
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:58,040
 few businesses where sun is better. Well, this doesn't all go well for my wealth chain

23
00:01:58,040 --> 00:02:02,760
 of ice cream vans, does it? But weirdly, my sister and brother-in-law had, they've just

24
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:07,840
 left Abu Dhabi, but they had an ice cream business out there as a side business, and it was

25
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:12,320
 a little ice cream shop by the beach, and they couldn't operate it in summer. It's so hot

26
00:02:12,320 --> 00:02:16,240
 in Abu Dhabi, it can only function in the winter. What's it all about? Yeah, it's just

27
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:20,720
 too hot outside, it gets up to 50. But is it that people don't really go outside? Yeah, yeah.

28
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:25,440
 Right. So it's not like the ice cream melts. Well, that's not like if you buy an ice cream

29
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:34,960
 instantly vaporizes. I demand another. Where is this one? One thing I found is, so this

30
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:39,560
 was from the same article that this came from, which is, I really like this, Campbell Soup,

31
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:44,560
 that company, they advertise based on the weather. So when the weather is bad, in particular

32
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:49,360
 cities, they buy more advertising space, because they know that people will want cozy warming

33
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:54,880
 food. That's a great idea. It's a nice, thick, country vegetable soup on cold days. Exactly.

34
00:02:54,880 --> 00:02:59,720
 And maybe a light broth. It's on some gasp that show on a hot day. It's in a mis-device

35
00:02:59,720 --> 00:03:04,720
 cream. That's really it. It's weird, it's so cool. When it's cold and everyone has

36
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:08,000
 flu, they could have chicken soup, because everyone likes it. They have a flu index as

37
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:11,400
 well. Do they? Yeah, so they made, yeah, they made a thing. So the thing Andy's talking

38
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:15,720
 about, it's called the misery index. For them, it's actually a happiness index, because

39
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:23,600
 it means more sales. And when the misery index goes up by 5%, then they queue a chicken soup

40
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:26,840
 out of it on the radio. And then that was so successful, they've got a flu index now. So

41
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:32,280
 as soon as there's a flu outbreak. That's crazy. They must be praying for Spanish flu

42
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:38,280
 to come back. They're not evil. No, you're right. They're just selling soup. You know,

43
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:43,520
 if it's very rainy, there's what type of business it's actually good for. Umbrella's ponchos.

44
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:50,680
 Yeah. Oh, I've opened up. People take photographs of puddles. The three main rain-based

45
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:58,520
 businesses. I ran out after two. You make a million more dollars a year if you take photographs

46
00:03:58,520 --> 00:04:04,200
 of puddles in the rain. Newspaper editors all over. Get me some puddle

47
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:14,160
 dust. I was actually talking post rain. Oh, and to dry to dry to dry things. How's

48
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:20,480
 the good? Yeah, no helicopter businesses do very well, particularly for orchards, because

49
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:24,640
 it when there's huge amount of rainfall, certain things, certain vegetables, certain grapes

50
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:28,640
 get so saturated that they need to get the water out immediately. So they hire helicopters

51
00:04:28,640 --> 00:04:33,680
 in and cherry orchards will have helicopters just hovering over them and drying off all

52
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:39,880
 of the grounds to get it back on the road. It's really cool. The helicopter business. Do

53
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:43,600
 you know the kind of weather that one study found is the only type of weather that really

54
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:49,760
 has an impact on your mood? I can give you the weather categories or do you want to make

55
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:55,320
 a good one? No, no. The early earth is hit by a meteorite and this rain of metal falling

56
00:04:55,320 --> 00:04:58,560
 from the sky. Firestorms. People don't mind at all. They just go about

57
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:05,000
 that day. We're very stupid. Okay, give us some options. So this is a study in the 1980s

58
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:09,000
 and it found the best predictor of mood was in a certain type of weather. The options

59
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:16,800
 are that they looked at sunniness, temperature, raininess, wind, humidity and... This is not

60
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:20,680
 going to be the last one. It's not the last one. Can I bet on the last one? Can I bet

61
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:24,080
 that it is the last one, which I think is missed? Because I think missed always affects

62
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:31,080
 my mood very much. This makes me feel spooky. Yeah, you look low. You can't see anything.

63
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:34,320
 It's a bit spooky. That's true. It's quite exciting. You feel like you're in a Victorian

64
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:40,600
 novel. That's the main effect that I think. I'm going to say it's wind because it makes

65
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:47,120
 me feel more agitated because the molecules around me are still agitated. They kind of

66
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:51,960
 somehow make me feel a bit imagine. I think it's got to be one of these two. I'm going

67
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:57,800
 for sunniness. Sunniness makes me a dickhead. It's why I have to leave Australia. I was

68
00:05:57,800 --> 00:06:01,920
 a right asshole over there, but now I'm sort of a bit more calm. But I get in a horrible

69
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:05,440
 mood when it's way too hot. Do you? Oh no, so you're not talking about sunniness. You're

70
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:09,840
 talking about temperature. Oh yeah. Right? Because it can be sunny. It's sunny today, for

71
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:12,640
 instance. It's a beautiful sunny day today. That's true. Okay, so he has been a bit of an

72
00:06:12,640 --> 00:06:18,680
 asshole today. I do explain that. It's just being a bit of a tricky day. Okay, so yeah.

73
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:22,840
 So why? You've listed almost all the things except the one that it is. Humidity was found

74
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:26,960
 to be the only one has a significant impact on activity and mood and it's because people

75
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:30,720
 feel very sleepy and they can't concentrate. Which is true, right? When you go to a humid

76
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:35,240
 place, you feel really gross. So I grew up in Hong Kong, which was all humid all the

77
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:39,660
 time. I guess it's established. You're always a dickhead now. I've never thought how this

78
00:06:39,660 --> 00:06:44,240
 weather is really molded me. Did you find your concentration improved when you came

79
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:52,640
 here? Mate, I'm not the good case study to ask about. The wettest day of the year on Earth,

80
00:06:52,640 --> 00:06:57,200
 whatever day it is, what percentage of the rain from the year do you think falls on that

81
00:06:57,200 --> 00:07:03,440
 one day? Okay, so if there are 365 days, it would be a bit less than 0.3% on an average

82
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:14,120
 day. So I'll say 1% triple the average. I'm going to say 35%. Love it. Love great. They

83
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:25,080
 have the puddle for top. He's a billionaire. It is 8.3%. That's about 12 of the Earth's rain

84
00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:29,960
 falls on a single day. What day is that? Well, we don't know. It's different. Surely that's

85
00:07:29,960 --> 00:07:35,440
 one day we would definitely know. It's the same day every year. Oh yeah, right. I met

86
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:43,440
 when was the last time that we know it's always the third Tuesday after Easter. And 50% of

87
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:48,880
 the Earth's precipitation falls on the 12 wettest days of the year. Wow, amazing. Isn't

88
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:53,320
 that amazing? That's incredible. Wow. That's really cool. It'd be so great if it was the

89
00:07:53,320 --> 00:07:58,660
 same every year. And we could just do a 12 day. What was it, 12 days? 12 day. 12 day long

90
00:07:58,660 --> 00:08:02,200
 hibernation. I wonder if it happens in a period of the year because lots of countries

91
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:07,800
 have big rainy seasons. So there must be a likelihood of it being... Well, the paper,

92
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:12,040
 the article where I read this, it said, "One key question the researchers wrote is when

93
00:08:12,040 --> 00:08:16,420
 during the year these extreme precipitation events are likely to occur." So I think basically

94
00:08:16,420 --> 00:08:20,320
 they don't really know when it's going to be, but they'll try and work it out. Just on rainy

95
00:08:20,320 --> 00:08:25,800
 conditions as in preparing for rain, have you heard of the rain shader? No. This is a new

96
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:29,280
 kind of umbrella, which has been invented in the last few years, and it is designed to

97
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:34,240
 solve the problems of... What are the problems of umbrellas? They're getting people's eyes.

98
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:38,320
 They're getting people's eyes. Inside out. Oh yeah, that is one actually. That's the main

99
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:41,160
 one. That's a really good one. And there's one more. You never have one on you when you

100
00:08:41,160 --> 00:08:47,600
 need it. That's not the one I'm looking for. They break the... No, people take them if you leave

101
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:52,400
 them at the front of a store. If it's really windy, you might blow away like Mary Poppins.

102
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:57,280
 Yeah, that's... She doesn't... Have you seen this little... She's not trying to help them out

103
00:08:57,280 --> 00:09:02,120
 and suddenly again, so she's blown away into the land. It's one of the sequels only 17 minutes

104
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:11,640
 long, very sad. Yeah, opening lines were... Sorry about that. Where were we? No, it's that you know

105
00:09:11,640 --> 00:09:15,400
 when you tilt it, all the water can fall off onto someone else. I'll cut it. That's a small

106
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:24,680
 problem. I'll hold it upside down, but you can... What? So the rain shader is this new... It

107
00:09:24,680 --> 00:09:29,680
 basically looks like a motorbike helmet, but in umbrella form, so it's open at the front

108
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:34,880
 and then at the back, it's really low. It's like wearing a big helmet that sort of cut out

109
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:38,240
 at the front, so that means you can't ever poke someone in the eye with it. That's really good.

110
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:41,520
 That's good. I don't think that would turn inside out either, so I think it's solving more

111
00:09:41,520 --> 00:09:48,440
 problems and... I think it might. Yeah. Yeah. In Harvard Business School, there's a paper

112
00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:53,840
 that they wrote quite recently called Toxic Workers, and this is about superstar workers

113
00:09:53,840 --> 00:10:00,240
 who outperform their colleagues by two to one or more, but who are awful to be around. And

114
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:04,320
 they want to work out whether it's useful to have these kind of amazing workers, or whether

115
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:09,520
 they do way too much harm than good. What do you think? Interesting. What do we think of James?

116
00:10:09,520 --> 00:10:19,040
 The question we're being asked to. Apparently according to them, it's better to hire two

117
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:24,720
 average employees than to keep one superstar long-tailed payroll. Do you guys know about the...

118
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:29,920
 This has always been one of my favourite studies, the Harvard Grant Study, which is this massive,

119
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:37,520
 it's famous, longitudinal study, and it's followed 268 people for 80 years, so it started following

120
00:10:37,520 --> 00:10:42,800
 them when they were at Harvard, and it studies every tiny aspect of their lives. And so it's told us

121
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:47,600
 so much about the decisions that you make and the personalities that you have, what impact that

122
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:52,160
 has on your life. It's like an unbelievable level of detail, so it measures things like the

123
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:57,840
 side of molds on their body, and how many teaspoons of sugar they have in their tea, and the hanging

124
00:10:57,840 --> 00:11:04,000
 length of your scrotum, and then they sort of follow them, and they hang length, guys. As opposed to

125
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:19,520
 when you've got it pinned back. So they measure all this, and they find out, you know, they successful,

126
00:11:19,520 --> 00:11:24,560
 as you JFK was one of the people who was originally in it, so he was successful, but actually quite unlucky.

127
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:31,600
 And at the moment, I think there are only about, not many of them left now, obviously I think there

128
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:35,200
 were 19 left a couple of years ago. But it's all the ones with the longest scrotums, and that's the

129
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:39,200
 interesting thing. And if that was true, is the sole predictor of how you do it, though? No, because

130
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:44,080
 they all chipped over and concussed themselves years ago. What they basically have found, or what the

131
00:11:44,080 --> 00:11:50,240
 person who's in charge of it now says is the most important discovery is that your relationships

132
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:54,640
 are the most important predictor of health, mental and physical, but literally the most important,

133
00:11:54,640 --> 00:11:59,520
 more important than cholesterol, more important than diet, it's, you know, the warmth of your

134
00:11:59,520 --> 00:12:04,800
 relationships, and that dictates how much you'll earn in the end, and it dictates how successful

135
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:09,920
 you'll be, and how happy you'll be. There we go. Or it could just be that rich people can buy

136
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:14,800
 relationships. Yeah. Yeah, I think it's that.

137
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:25,520
 Okay, it is time for fact number two, and that is Andy. My effect is that when they are meeting,

138
00:12:25,520 --> 00:12:30,240
 male cuttlefish can flirt with one side of their body, and simultaneously pretend to be a female

139
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:36,160
 with the other side of their body. It's a really weird thing they do. So, cuttlefish,

140
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:42,800
 mollusks in the ocean are kind of mollusk, and they're a bit squid-y and a bit octopussy, and

141
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:49,360
 they change the pattern of the skin all the time for camouflage, but they do it for lots of

142
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:52,880
 different reasons, so they might do it to avoid predators, or they sometimes do it even to catch

143
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:58,160
 prey. But one thing they do is when they're courting, male cuttlefish display, you know,

144
00:12:58,160 --> 00:13:04,640
 courtship patterns to females on their bodies, but they don't want other males to fight them. So,

145
00:13:04,640 --> 00:13:10,400
 they simultaneously make the back half of their body display a female pattern. So a male who's

146
00:13:10,400 --> 00:13:15,520
 standing behind the flirting male will think, "Oh, that's just two female cuttlefish having a chat

147
00:13:15,520 --> 00:13:20,160
 with each other," and he won't get in the way. But if it looks like it's a male chatting to a female,

148
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:24,640
 they might try and break it up. But is there no chance that the male cuttlefish will start

149
00:13:24,640 --> 00:13:29,520
 flirting with the back of the female camouflage? That sometimes happens. Yeah, because that

150
00:13:29,520 --> 00:13:39,280
 would just be a long cue. Basically, yeah, that does happen. So, some males have harems of females,

151
00:13:39,280 --> 00:13:43,440
 which they guard, jealously, from challenges, and other males disguise themselves to look female,

152
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:47,760
 sneak in, have sex with the real females and then sneak out. But sometimes the disguised males

153
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:54,080
 look so good that the alpha male will guard him as part of his harem. So, you can have a harem which

154
00:13:54,080 --> 00:13:58,080
 has mostly males in it. That's amazing. I'm going to see all pretending to be females. But they only

155
00:13:58,080 --> 00:14:02,640
 look good from the back, so they're just never going around the front. They're just strictly

156
00:14:02,640 --> 00:14:09,840
 ass-based differences. They are amazing. They're incredible. They also have two prehensile tentacles,

157
00:14:09,840 --> 00:14:15,520
 I think, on the front, which sometimes they hide. They've got pockets under their eyes where they

158
00:14:15,520 --> 00:14:24,080
 put them when they're not using them. So, such a great place to have a pocket. They're so weird.

159
00:14:24,080 --> 00:14:28,000
 It's so weird when you don't, because octopuses, I think, we all know, are quite weird. So, when

160
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:32,000
 you talk about them, it's kind of, but this is all just like, what is this animal? Are we just joking?

161
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:36,480
 Are we lying? It's got pockets under its eyes, turns its butt into a woman. Come on.

162
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:40,080
 The most amazing thing about a cuttlefish, which people maybe know, and David Atmer is very good at

163
00:14:40,080 --> 00:14:44,720
 showing, is that their disguise is right. So, they disguise themselves even better than, you know,

164
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:48,800
 the octopuses that can do it and other things, and they can do it within a few milliseconds. They can

165
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:53,440
 just change colour and they can give themselves stripes, like you say, kind of caulting patterns.

166
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:58,480
 It is incredible. They can, as well as change in the colour, they can change from smooth to bumpy

167
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:05,120
 the skin, which is a really cool idea. So, they mimic the object that they might be camouflaging

168
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:08,640
 themselves on. But not just colour, but also the texture. Yeah, the texture. It's like, I'll bring

169
00:15:08,640 --> 00:15:16,800
 yourself in warts, something like that. If you want to pretend to be a witch. A lot of those on the

170
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:21,840
 bottom of the object. Yeah. I read it as they have the equivalent of hundreds of cocktail umbrellas

171
00:15:21,840 --> 00:15:26,960
 under their skin. So, they have all these structures that they can sort of lock upright to make

172
00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:32,800
 themselves look nobily, basically, if they want to look like coral. Yeah, for example. And that camouflage,

173
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:36,960
 they can freeze it and lock it in place for up to an hour. So, they change it all the time,

174
00:15:36,960 --> 00:15:41,440
 but they can just go, okay, I'm going to stay like this for an hour now. Wow. They are really weird

175
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:46,400
 and really cool. That's crazy. And also, these changes are to do with their mood and whether they're

176
00:15:46,400 --> 00:15:50,880
 hungry or scared or whatever. So, you can look at the colours on a cuttlefish and work out what it's

177
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:57,680
 feeling. That'll be useful in humans. Oh, good. They can do a chessboard pattern. They can. They can,

178
00:15:57,680 --> 00:16:02,480
 they can make themselves look exactly like a chessboard. Why? For when they need a camouflage next to a

179
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:08,160
 game of chess going right now. Because they can do the bumping stuff as well. Well, so, you're saying

180
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:15,840
 they can do the pieces. They can have an actual game on their own body. That would be amazing. That's

181
00:16:15,840 --> 00:16:21,840
 very good. So, can you explain the chessboard thing? Why would they do that? Well, they they've been

182
00:16:21,840 --> 00:16:26,320
 tested by scientists. There's no natural chessboard pattern, but it's just to show how versatile they are.

183
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:30,800
 That's incredible. So, they can, oh yeah, yeah. And they can, Richard Hammond, who used to be on

184
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:37,920
 top gear. He could also do that. But terribly sadly, he doesn't know the rules.

185
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:44,400
 It's a show, real shame. No, he is one of his shows. They put a cuttlefish in an underwater lounge,

186
00:16:44,400 --> 00:16:48,400
 which they mocked up, which had all sort of like a zebra pattern sofa and stuff. They were just

187
00:16:48,400 --> 00:16:53,440
 putting it to my face. And that was in Richard Hammond's house, did you say or? No, sorry,

188
00:16:53,440 --> 00:17:00,160
 how does he come into this? He was making a show and it was about cool animals or something and

189
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:07,920
 it featured an underwater lounge with all this stuff. Richard Hammond's lounge is not underwater.

190
00:17:07,920 --> 00:17:15,280
 And so, okay, so they perfectly mimicked the chessboard. That is so cool. It's really bizarre.

191
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:20,480
 Yeah. I mean, it wouldn't be perfect. I don't get excited. No, but I mean, I'm actually more

192
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:25,440
 excited by the experiment that we are taking non underwater based objects and seeing if they can

193
00:17:25,440 --> 00:17:29,520
 mimic that because you wouldn't naturally see that. Yeah, I'm interested that they can, I didn't

194
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:32,640
 realise they can actually mimic stuff that they'd never seen before. There might be half a dozen

195
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:37,840
 cuttlefish in this room now. We don't know. This entire building is half a fish. I throw a top to

196
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:44,800
 bottom. My favourite cuttlefish is the bottom dwelling flamboyant cuttlefish. We'll say that again.

197
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:48,960
 The bottom dwelling flamboyant cuttlefish. God, if you've got something dwelling in your bottom,

198
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:55,760
 you don't want it to be flamboyant, right? It's the only mollusk with a quadrepedal gate.

199
00:17:55,760 --> 00:17:59,440
 That's amazing. Yeah, that is incredible. The way they hunt is cool, so they've

200
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:03,600
 got, if you look at them, they look exactly like the oods from Doctor Who, and I know only

201
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:06,960
 Dan when I know what I'm talking about, but that's what a lot of them look like, so they've got

202
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:11,200
 these sort of big long funnels on their nose, and the way they, a lot of them catch prey,

203
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:15,760
 is by blasting their funnel at the sand, and they'll blow up a prawn that's having a nap.

204
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:23,680
 They just shoots up into their prawns. I suppose they must do, right? If I was going to nap,

205
00:18:23,680 --> 00:18:27,600
 yeah. They hunt in the day and prawns are not turned on, so they're often asleep in the day.

206
00:18:28,560 --> 00:18:33,600
 What a horrible way to wake up being blasted after you're there, into the mouth of a nude.

207
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:38,560
 One thing about cuttlefish, there might also be known as they give us sepia, they give us basically

208
00:18:38,560 --> 00:18:44,080
 the look of Victorian photographs. What? Yeah, sepia ink, so they have an ink sack in it.

209
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:46,960
 There are three things that develop when they're in embryo. The first three things develop

210
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:51,520
 are their two eyes, weird shaped eyes, and then their ink sack, and that's a defense mechanism,

211
00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:55,840
 so they blast out ink as a last resort if they're being chased, and that's where we get sepia,

212
00:18:55,840 --> 00:18:59,520
 it's our main source of that colour. Wait for the day, or the original...

213
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:03,120
 Wow, that's amazing. Six years like that browny colour, isn't it?

214
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:06,160
 Yeah. Yeah. You put over photographs to make them look...

215
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:12,880
 That's sort of a Victorian... Yeah, but wait, sorry, did that get used in the Victorian photo process?

216
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:17,840
 We needed cuttlefish ink. Yeah. That's incredible. Yeah, that's amazing.

217
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:20,560
 They're a handy, handy little guy. You just wouldn't think there would be enough

218
00:19:20,560 --> 00:19:24,480
 cuttlefish to make enough sepia for the Victorian photo industry.

219
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:28,000
 There's so much cuttlefish. And also, probably wasn't that bigger

220
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,560
 industry in those days. Oh yeah. It's not like mobile phones,

221
00:19:30,560 --> 00:19:33,440
 where everyone's got a camera these days. That's true, just the rich people.

222
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:37,440
 Anyone could be a puddle photographer these days, but all the art has been lost from the trade.

223
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:42,400
 And it's not like every time you put a sepia filter over your iPhone photo,

224
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:49,600
 a cuttlefish has to die. We've moved on. There's no like when you go to snappy snappes huge tank

225
00:19:49,600 --> 00:20:02,720
 for the cuttlefish. Okay, it's time for fact number three, and that is James.

226
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:07,920
 Okay, my fact this week is that William of Orange's favourite drink was cock ale.

227
00:20:07,920 --> 00:20:16,640
 Which was? Which was a drink? It's made of ale with a cock in it, a cockerel, a rooster.

228
00:20:17,920 --> 00:20:23,840
 And it was, they put the rooster in when it was being brewed. And the idea was that it would put

229
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:28,560
 something into the mix, which would give you virility. And it was like the red bull of its day,

230
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:37,040
 almost. And actually the first known recipe for cock ale was in 1669. And it was written by a guy

231
00:20:37,040 --> 00:20:43,440
 called Sir Kennellm Digby, who people who know the podcast might remember his father. You ever

232
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:50,960
 had a ride, Digby, who was one of the gunpowder platters. All the makes of return. This is so exciting.

233
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:58,080
 So Kennellm Digby, he wrote a lot of like cookbooks and he invented bacon and eggs as well, actually.

234
00:20:58,080 --> 00:21:04,720
 Sorry, I think we give pigs a lot of the credit for bacon and chickens, the credit for eggs.

235
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:08,720
 You're right. He just invented putting them together. I don't think so. I think if we cooked in a

236
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:15,440
 me, for example, I wouldn't be able to claim credit for the recipe. Yeah. Sorry enough, the recipe

237
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:20,720
 of this take eight gallons of ale, take a cock and boil him well, then take four pounds of raisins

238
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:25,840
 of the sun well stones, two or three nutmegs, three or four flakes of mace, half a pound of dates,

239
00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:31,120
 be told these were the mortar and put them in two quarts of the best sack, then what sack is.

240
00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:35,680
 And then when the ale have done working, put these in and stop it close six or seven days and then

241
00:21:35,680 --> 00:21:42,000
 bottle it. And after a month, you may drink it. So it's a bit like a mold cocktail. Yeah. I think

242
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:47,360
 sack is kind of wine. I think like maybe fortified wine. I'm not sure. Well, there is a theory,

243
00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:52,480
 which is a terrible theory. It can't be right. But I know what you're going to say over the theory.

244
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:58,160
 Yeah, because they were adding this new element ingredient to something that shouldn't be there.

245
00:21:58,160 --> 00:22:05,360
 Cock ale was effectively the origins of cocktail. It's just not true. I'm saying it's a theory.

246
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:10,080
 Where do you think it came from then cocktail? Oh, there are different, I can't remember. There

247
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:16,480
 are other bad theories as well. But that's worth. Here's another bad theory. So a cocktail used to be

248
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:23,040
 a horse with a docked tail because it looked a bit like a Cox comb. And then it became a word for a

249
00:22:23,040 --> 00:22:28,560
 horse of a mixed pedigree. And then it became a drink because it had lots of mixes of different drinks

250
00:22:28,560 --> 00:22:34,960
 in it. That's one theory. And HL Menken thought that it came from the French coquettier, meaning egg

251
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:39,680
 cup, because you would drink it out of a very small cocktail. Oh, I like that one. That's my

252
00:22:39,680 --> 00:22:44,320
 favorite so far. I think none of them are true. Yeah. I can't believe we know who made bacon and

253
00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:48,960
 eggs for the first time. I'm sorry, I've just kind of danced over that, but that's huge. That's a big deal.

254
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:53,280
 That's a big deal. As someone else probably would have done it. And actually he was just writing down

255
00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:58,720
 recipes, right? So, right. He didn't invent. I don't think he invented cock ale either. I think he

256
00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:04,560
 just wrote it down. Okay. The recipes were simpler then, weren't they? He just wrote bacon eggs. And

257
00:23:04,560 --> 00:23:09,600
 he went down in history. No, they're really complicated lots of them. So there's a 1739

258
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:14,640
 cock ale recipe in a book called The Complete Housewife, which was one of the first big household manuals.

259
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:19,600
 And it starts with take 10 gallons of ale and a large cock, the older the better. But then you had

260
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:24,880
 to stamp on it in a mortar until it was, it's bones were broken. It said parboiled the cock,

261
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:31,280
 flay it and stamp him in a stone mortar. Yeah. My mortar is not big enough to be stamping around it.

262
00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:39,920
 Need a bigger mortar. Another weird ingredient for old drinks, cider in the 16th century used to have

263
00:23:39,920 --> 00:23:44,640
 sheep's blood added to it. Cornwall sheep's blood. What do at what point they realize that it's

264
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:50,320
 just nicer without the sheep's blood. One day they'd run out of sheep's blood and they just made

265
00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:57,840
 cider. You were laughed out of the pub if you suggested. Do you think we could? Yeah. So the sort of

266
00:23:57,840 --> 00:24:03,680
 precursors to beer seem to all have been mold spice beer. I think our kind of beer that doesn't contain

267
00:24:03,680 --> 00:24:09,280
 any spices and flavours is the anomaly in history really. So you see all these recipes for kind of

268
00:24:09,280 --> 00:24:15,120
 heating up beer. They always were adding cinnamon and cloves and nutmeg and ginger. Another thing they

269
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:20,080
 added, almost always, if you look back to beer recipes, if you look in old books and stuff or from

270
00:24:20,080 --> 00:24:26,720
 the 16 1700s toast. So they always put toast on top of beer, didn't they? Flowsed it. Yeah. So they'll say like,

271
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:34,080
 you know, like a crouton in a soup basically. Yeah, like giant croutons. I'd like a crouton.

272
00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:38,480
 In a bit. Well, I like beer and I like croutons. There we go. Seems likely that I would like both

273
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:43,760
 these six. I think you'd love the 16 hundreds. It's hard though, isn't it? To most beer glasses,

274
00:24:43,760 --> 00:24:48,800
 most points are not quite big enough for a full slice of toast to float on the surface. No, but these

275
00:24:48,800 --> 00:24:54,720
 beers were fitting entire roosters in them. So the vessels were bigger. What was the point of the toast?

276
00:24:54,720 --> 00:25:00,240
 Well, one recipe I read explained why the toast was there. It said, it claps the white

277
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:04,880
 waistcoat on a cup of good drink. Oh, brilliant. That's pretty good. I think that's great.

278
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:11,280
 Right. Oh, yeah. The white waistcoat. Oh, wow. Yeah. Yeah. I've just done that.

279
00:25:11,280 --> 00:25:17,840
 I was reading about just the consumption of alcohol in the 16 hundreds and I found this thing

280
00:25:17,840 --> 00:25:23,040
 that Parliament passed was an act that I'd not heard of. It was the act to repress the odious and

281
00:25:23,040 --> 00:25:29,120
 loathsome sin of drunkenness, because everyone was just getting so drunk all the time. But the wording

282
00:25:29,120 --> 00:25:36,320
 of that is just stunning. Yeah. Adios. Yeah. So, yeah. So hops, which were medicinal plants,

283
00:25:36,320 --> 00:25:41,920
 they'd been added to beers and I think that was a way around of saying that you were doing

284
00:25:41,920 --> 00:25:47,360
 for medical purposes as opposed to it being just getting drunk. Oh, yeah. They didn't like hops in

285
00:25:47,360 --> 00:25:50,800
 Britain. They really didn't like hops. So, when we talk about beer from thousands of years ago,

286
00:25:50,800 --> 00:25:55,360
 it's not beer like we know. So, beer to be classified as beer now has to be made with hops.

287
00:25:55,360 --> 00:26:00,960
 But they only actually came to England in the 1400s, I think, from the Netherlands and everyone

288
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:04,320
 thought they were a bit poisonous and they were a bit weird. So, that's, you know, it's the plant

289
00:26:04,320 --> 00:26:09,360
 that adds the bitter taste to beer. Right. And actually, the first person to describe hops

290
00:26:09,360 --> 00:26:15,520
 scientifically and talk about how they were used in beer was a woman. It was a Christian botanist

291
00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:23,280
 and Abbas who is called Hildegard of Bingen. I've heard of her actually. Yeah. She was a big deal.

292
00:26:23,280 --> 00:26:28,480
 Yeah. She was quite revolutionary in the beer industry. Did she see lots of, oh, I can't remember

293
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:34,160
 what about her now. I think she saw lots of visions and stuff, didn't she? It's not the same Hildegard.

294
00:26:34,160 --> 00:26:40,720
 Oh, maybe not. Is the more than one Hildegard. Oh, no. It can't be that many. There was one

295
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:46,480
 who saw lots of visions and then wrote one of the first books or something, but maybe it was a different

296
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:50,800
 one. No, it might have been her. She was big. She wasn't actually a fan of hops even though she knew

297
00:26:50,800 --> 00:26:55,840
 how they were used. She said they make the soul of man sad and way down his inner organs. Whoa.

298
00:26:55,840 --> 00:27:03,200
 That's kind of what it feels like after seven fights. There is a thing I can't remember exactly

299
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:07,520
 what it is, but in Germany, you're only allowed three ingredients in beer to this day. Really?

300
00:27:07,520 --> 00:27:13,360
 I think it's hops, water, and what would it be? Barley? Barley here. And I think it's really strict.

301
00:27:13,360 --> 00:27:17,600
 And they've had hundreds and hundreds of years of rules about this. So there was the Brow

302
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:23,200
 Ordnung in 16th century Bavaria, where you weren't allowed to make beer between the 23rd of April

303
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:29,920
 and 29th of September. So no brewing allowed, because breweries caught fire very easily because

304
00:27:29,920 --> 00:27:34,320
 they were all made of wood and there were lots of coal fires to heat them up. So it was bad for

305
00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:41,520
 fire, so they banned it. But you had to have sellers to store beer from the winter so that you could

306
00:27:41,520 --> 00:27:47,040
 drink it in the summer. And the breweries stored them in big underground sellers. And then above

307
00:27:47,040 --> 00:27:52,400
 ground they planted trees to keep them shady because they wanted to keep the cool in the sellers.

308
00:27:52,400 --> 00:27:58,800
 And then they started adding tables and gravel to these above ground tree areas. And that's the

309
00:27:58,800 --> 00:28:06,320
 beginning of the beer garden. So yeah, the beer garden comes from this band on brewing in the summer.

310
00:28:06,320 --> 00:28:10,000
 And it was actually four beer, really, the beer garden, not for us.

311
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:15,440
 Where is what else is garden, right?

312
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:21,600
 Better than the beer. So just speaking of German beer, you know, Pilsner,

313
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:25,760
 so where that name comes from. I thought it was a place or something.

314
00:28:25,760 --> 00:28:32,480
 So it is a place, it's from Pilsen, which is one of Europe's first beer brewing capitals.

315
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:37,920
 And Pilsen, it was called Pilsen when it became this beer brewing capitol. And that is because

316
00:28:37,920 --> 00:28:42,560
 that was the German word for henbane, which is like a really deadly poisonous plant,

317
00:28:42,560 --> 00:28:46,480
 but they used to put that in beer all the time. So they were brew beer with henbane because I

318
00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:50,560
 don't make it really, I mean, that is really complicated. Poisonous. Yeah, it's very dangerous.

319
00:28:50,560 --> 00:28:54,240
 What was they doing with beer for hundreds of years? Let's put cockles in it. Let's put sheep's

320
00:28:54,240 --> 00:29:00,400
 flooded in poison. There was no, they went and they went three ingredients. That's it for that one.

321
00:29:00,400 --> 00:29:07,360
 But a little bit of poison, no, no. It gave you hallucinations. If you managed to escape death,

322
00:29:07,360 --> 00:29:11,680
 it was quite fun. But so that's where Pilsner comes from is after henbane, because that was a

323
00:29:11,680 --> 00:29:19,520
 crucial ingredient of deadly beer. Wow, very cool. Just one last weird origin thing. So you mentioned

324
00:29:19,520 --> 00:29:24,400
 that beer brewing book. You mentioned that beer brewing book was for a housewife. Beer brewing was

325
00:29:24,400 --> 00:29:30,160
 sort of solely a women's thing across the world, wherever beer was brewed until pretty recently,

326
00:29:30,160 --> 00:29:36,400
 until basically the 15, 1600s when hops actually came in. So the ale wife is a thing because it was

327
00:29:36,400 --> 00:29:40,640
 always the woman who would do the cooking beer in the house brewing the beer. Women would control

328
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:44,480
 the breweries. For instance, in ancient Egypt, they all had their own breweries. Women were being

329
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:50,880
 in charge and so they became the main beer sellers and barmaid still in sort of de-cendian novels.

330
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:56,800
 So women would start making surplus beer because they'd been making it for the home and then they

331
00:29:56,800 --> 00:30:01,280
 would go and sell it. So they'd put greenery over their doors and in some cases they'd put a broom

332
00:30:01,280 --> 00:30:05,920
 up against their door which signified that you were selling beer and they would stand on the corner

333
00:30:05,920 --> 00:30:13,120
 and they'd advertise their beer by wearing a tall hat and they would often have a pet cat

334
00:30:13,120 --> 00:30:24,480
 who would chase the pets away. Well, it's a theory. This is where the witch image comes from.

335
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:29,280
 Yeah, so there were tall hats that I'm the beer selling lady. I'm the ale wife. And they all had cats.

336
00:30:29,280 --> 00:30:32,960
 They had a cat to chase away pests because otherwise they ate the grain with which they made the beer.

337
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:36,960
 They were all testing out crazy ingredients like eye of newt instead. Yeah,

338
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:42,800
 they were testing things. Yeah, they're literally a genic. They go stirring it around in their cauldrons.

339
00:30:42,800 --> 00:30:51,680
 All their massive mortars. Yes. Oh my goodness. And then came the witch. Really? Wow. Yeah, it's a thought

340
00:30:51,680 --> 00:31:03,600
 that I haven't made up. Okay, it is time for our final fact of the show and that is my fact.

341
00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:09,520
 My fact this week is that after five months of forensically analyzing the indents made by a pen on

342
00:31:09,520 --> 00:31:15,840
 paper, Dorset Police managed to recover 26 pages of lost words by a blind novelist who hadn't

343
00:31:15,840 --> 00:31:22,880
 realized that her pen had run out of ink. That is quite remarkable. Yeah, it's pretty extraordinary.

344
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:27,280
 This was an author called Trish Vickers. It was her first book that she was writing. She had gone

345
00:31:27,280 --> 00:31:33,520
 blind through diabetes and she decided that she wanted to pass her time by writing a book. So she

346
00:31:33,520 --> 00:31:38,320
 created a system and she did it long hand with pen, created a system where she had elastic bands

347
00:31:38,320 --> 00:31:42,400
 along the paper. She would write out the pages and then her son would come at the end of the week and

348
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:48,640
 he would transcribe them onto a word document or whatever he chose. So he came one week after she

349
00:31:48,640 --> 00:31:53,680
 had this burst of inspiration. She wrote 26 pages, but he discovered these blank pages sitting there.

350
00:31:53,680 --> 00:31:58,640
 Turns out the pen had run out. She was devastated. He was devastated because she'd written such great

351
00:31:58,640 --> 00:32:04,000
 stuff. And it is quite funny. And it's incredibly funny. Thank you, James, for pointing that out.

352
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:09,440
 Yeah, so she was very upset and they're going touch with the police to say can you do anything

353
00:32:09,440 --> 00:32:18,080
 about this? And yeah, the way they arrested the pen went effective. Yeah, so actually it's

354
00:32:18,080 --> 00:32:23,600
 very sweet at Dorset Police Station. Someone said they would look through the pages with the special

355
00:32:23,600 --> 00:32:27,600
 light that they use for forensics to see the little markings that the pen would have left on the

356
00:32:27,600 --> 00:32:33,840
 page, the little dense. And they spent five months now. It wasn't five months of intense analysis.

357
00:32:33,840 --> 00:32:37,280
 The burglars in Dorset at the time. We're just having a field day.

358
00:32:37,280 --> 00:32:42,560
 It was, I believe it was one person who did it on her lunch break for five months. Although,

359
00:32:42,560 --> 00:32:45,280
 if you're a burglar, having a field day is probably a very bad day for you.

360
00:32:45,280 --> 00:32:50,480
 Burglar's call it having a house full of electronic equipment day.

361
00:32:53,840 --> 00:33:00,000
 But so she managed to get the book done. It was called Granifer's Legacy. Sadly, she actually passed

362
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:05,200
 away before she could hold a physical copy in her hands, but it was published two hours prior to her

363
00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:11,360
 passing away, the physical copies. So she just missed out by two hours. She knew it was being published.

364
00:33:11,360 --> 00:33:17,200
 She knew, and I think she held a proof in her hand. So yeah, so I thought that the only method,

365
00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:22,240
 you know, when you make indentations on paper, you can kind of read it or you can shade over it

366
00:33:22,240 --> 00:33:26,720
 with a pencil and that kind of shows up because it doesn't, the pencil shading doesn't fill the

367
00:33:26,720 --> 00:33:33,280
 indentations. Do you know the police do it? They have a special wand. So first of all, they don't

368
00:33:33,280 --> 00:33:38,240
 do the pencil thing, do they? Because that could damage the evidence. Right. But they have this

369
00:33:38,240 --> 00:33:44,080
 device they've invented called an electrostatic detection apparatus. And they basically documents

370
00:33:44,080 --> 00:33:48,240
 which are charged with static, piece of paper charged with static, builds up more charge in the

371
00:33:48,240 --> 00:33:54,400
 furrows where the pencil is indented, all the pen is indented, then on the flat. And even even

372
00:33:54,400 --> 00:34:00,720
 really microscopic non-visible to the naked eye furrows exist. So they put the document on this plate

373
00:34:00,720 --> 00:34:05,840
 and then they pass a wand charged with electricity over it and then they apply this mist of toner and

374
00:34:05,840 --> 00:34:12,000
 the toner just gravitates towards the furrows and you fill in a page of writing that way. Wow.

375
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:17,760
 It's basically a magic wand. So they sort of charge up the indentations that have got a lot of

376
00:34:17,760 --> 00:34:23,440
 static in. Yeah, that's cool. Super cool. It's quite similar to fingerprinting, right? That kind of

377
00:34:23,440 --> 00:34:28,480
 process where with fingerprinting you can kind of do it yourself. So apparently a really good

378
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:33,600
 substance for putting over fingerprints so you can see them is raw cocoa powder. If you want to

379
00:34:33,600 --> 00:34:38,160
 do it, you can use raw cocoa powder or talcum powder. But you're not going to have the database of

380
00:34:38,160 --> 00:34:43,840
 the entire country at home, are you? Are you just going to see a fingerprint that you can't really

381
00:34:43,840 --> 00:34:47,840
 recognise? Yeah, but you can definitely, if it's like who took my chocolate bar, you can definitely

382
00:34:47,840 --> 00:34:53,280
 get your family's fingerprints, I reckon, and in your room, and then compare them. It's a real

383
00:34:53,280 --> 00:34:56,960
 insight into others too. I've heard that. Yeah, definitely would have done that.

384
00:34:56,960 --> 00:35:04,800
 The system, the magic wand system that you talked about is called the Electrostatic Detection

385
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:13,440
 Apparatus ESDA, and it was invented by two DJs. Wow. They were called DJ Foster and DJ Marants.

386
00:35:13,440 --> 00:35:21,600
 They weren't disc jockeys. It was just their names. I was thinking they were bored in the booth one day.

387
00:35:21,600 --> 00:35:25,280
 No, it's just a coincidence that they had the same two initials and I thought

388
00:35:25,280 --> 00:35:30,720
 it was quite funny. It was a good set up. You had us going in the first half. We did not see it

389
00:35:30,720 --> 00:35:36,000
 coming. I was thinking, that was a pretty boring name for DJs, aren't they? DJ Foster.

390
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:44,800
 Can I just say one more thing on ESDA? Yeah. ESDA is kind of famous because it's what,

391
00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:50,560
 do you remember the West Midlands series crime squad got into a lot of trouble for faking people's

392
00:35:50,560 --> 00:35:57,440
 confessions, the Birmingham pub bummings? Oh, yeah. They got the Birmingham six. Yeah,

393
00:35:57,440 --> 00:36:02,240
 they got released because of that and it was using ESDA that they found that the police were making

394
00:36:02,240 --> 00:36:07,520
 these fake confessions. Oh, really? Oh, very cool. That's cool. That's cool. That's cool, but true.

395
00:36:07,520 --> 00:36:13,120
 Varmadermid actually has written a book on forensics, which sounds really good. I was reading

396
00:36:13,120 --> 00:36:17,840
 a summary of it, so she's the, she's a sort of crime writer, isn't she? Of fiction. Yeah,

397
00:36:17,840 --> 00:36:22,480
 of fiction. But this is a factual book and so there's loads of good facts in there, but there's

398
00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:28,080
 a story of the arsonist called John Orr, which I didn't know about. He was quite a big criminal

399
00:36:28,080 --> 00:36:34,640
 in the 1980s. He was basically a fireman and who ended up being done for burning down loads and

400
00:36:34,640 --> 00:36:39,120
 loads of houses, because if you're a fireman, you know how? So I think he was suspected in more than

401
00:36:39,120 --> 00:36:46,400
 a thousand fires in California and he was eventually caught. He was caught partly because of forensics,

402
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:52,640
 so they matched a fingerprint on one bit of sort of half-burned match that he'd used. Wow. But he was

403
00:36:52,640 --> 00:36:58,080
 also caught. Did you think they went, "We've got a match?" And they went, "Yeah, we can see that."

404
00:36:58,080 --> 00:37:03,840
 So good. There was two hours of confusion there. Between Laurel and Hardy to fire.

405
00:37:03,840 --> 00:37:10,560
 So another thing that tipped him off, he might be responsible, was that he'd written a novel called

406
00:37:10,560 --> 00:37:15,360
 "Points of Origin" that contained a highly detailed description of the same fire that they were

407
00:37:15,360 --> 00:37:21,760
 investigating for several striking similarities and also the fire that he was done for in 1984.

408
00:37:21,760 --> 00:37:26,800
 Everyone who investigated it said this is an accidental fire and he kept insisting that no,

409
00:37:26,800 --> 00:37:31,280
 it was arson. So it's like he really had this desire for people to know. Do you think he was one of

410
00:37:31,280 --> 00:37:35,600
 these people who deliberately set fires so they can go and put them out? Yeah. He's because that has

411
00:37:35,600 --> 00:37:42,800
 happened. We did that. It's called something like hero syndrome. Maybe. What is not a hero now? He is

412
00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:50,320
 serving a long jail sentence. Very much a hero. Nice. That's what the judge said when he passed the

413
00:37:50,320 --> 00:38:00,400
 zero. I'd love to be one of those comedy judges. Something funny just as a setting them down.

414
00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:06,240
 I didn't know that comedy judge was a career actually. What is not, no, you don't apply to be the

415
00:38:06,240 --> 00:38:12,240
 comedy judge. It is a regular judge who happens to have a bit of fun. There was that guy who got

416
00:38:12,240 --> 00:38:18,080
 done for, he got done for something, but he loved the Beatles and the judge sentenced him using as many

417
00:38:18,080 --> 00:38:26,000
 Beatles. Oh no, that's so nice. What did he do? What did he say? Maybe he stole from the taxman?

418
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:30,240
 Yeah. Brilliant. Yeah. You probably were, it was probably a cry for help. You may have had a hard

419
00:38:30,240 --> 00:38:40,240
 day's night in your yellow submarine. Wait, it was the criminal affair of the Beatles. Yeah.

420
00:38:40,240 --> 00:38:44,400
 Okay, got it, got it. So it was kind of like the Beatles were sending him down. That is really hard.

421
00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:50,960
 You shouldn't have used your revolver. Yeah, let's go to the big albums. Yeah. You've got a rubber

422
00:38:50,960 --> 00:38:57,200
 soul. Yeah, because you know, it's like a bad soul. A rubber soul. A rubber soul. A rubber soul is

423
00:38:57,200 --> 00:39:00,480
 better. A rubber soul. A rubber soul is better. I mean, none of these are good, are they?
