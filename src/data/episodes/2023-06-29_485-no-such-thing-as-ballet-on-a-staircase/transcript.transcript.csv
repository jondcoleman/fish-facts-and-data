00:01:33,00:01:36,It's time to say on with the podcast
00:01:36,00:02:00,Hello and welcome to another episode of no such thing as a fish a weekly podcast coming to you from the qi offices in
00:02:00,00:02:07,Hoburn my name is Dan Shriver. I am sitting here with James Harkin Andrew Hunter Murray and Beck Hill and once again
00:02:07,00:02:13,We have gathered around the microphones with our four favorite facts from the last seven days and in a particular order here
00:02:13,00:02:16,We go starting with fact number one and that is
00:02:16,00:02:19,Beck in
00:02:19,00:02:26,1927 a paint and was filed for an upper artist designed to scare criminals into confessing their crimes
00:02:26,00:02:30,By creating an optical illusion of a ghost skeleton
00:02:30,00:02:39,"How to do it it's pretty cool. Yeah, I mean it the paint was filed and I mean it was granted in 1930"
00:02:39,00:02:43,"Okay, it expired in 1947 so if anyone wants to make that now"
00:02:43,00:02:48,That make call of duty better. Wouldn't it whether trying to get
00:02:48,00:02:51,line of duty
00:02:52,00:02:58,"It is yeah, yeah, I just don't work out there as well. I think it would work everywhere pop a glowing skeleton"
00:02:58,00:03:02,"Sorry, we'll get we'll get messages from the game as it won't work in call of duty"
00:03:02,00:03:04,Intensely realistic war experience
00:03:04,00:03:10,Is more a kind of like can you storm Normandy than where were you on the night of the fourth?
00:03:10,00:03:14,More games need interrogation
00:03:14,00:03:17,The Mario interrogation
00:03:20,00:03:22,It's reading about
00:03:22,00:03:28,"Show jumping the other day, you know in the Olympics and in the first Olympic show jumping part of it was"
00:03:28,00:03:30,Just because we're talking about video games
00:03:30,00:03:36,The horse had to walk along and people would roll barrels towards them and they'd have to jump over the barrels like in
00:03:36,00:03:41,"Isn't that cool? That's amazing. Yeah, imagine if that was your job"
00:03:41,00:03:48,"Sorry, but this was off topic so quickly"
00:03:48,00:03:55,"Oh, yeah, so it was like it was a light. Do you know what I couldn't find out whether it was a real skeleton or a fake one"
00:03:55,00:03:59,But given the date I'm guessing was a real one
00:03:59,00:04:07,But it was a life-size skeleton with red glowing light bulbs in the eyes that would turn on and off to create the effect of blinking
00:04:07,00:04:11,and it was lit from the top and the bottom and
00:04:11,00:04:13,basically the
00:04:13,00:04:15,the suspected
00:04:15,00:04:17,criminal would be put into a
00:04:17,00:04:21,chamber like a room that's completely darkened and then
00:04:21,00:04:25,the interrogator would sit behind this skeleton and
00:04:25,00:04:31,Talk through a megaphone that would sort of come out of the skeletons mouth and the skeleton be
00:04:31,00:04:35,Lit a little bit to create the effect of a ghostly outline
00:04:35,00:04:42,"Blowing eyes. Yeah. Yeah, and it's and the effect the idea was the criminal would go into a darkened room to begin with"
00:04:42,00:04:44,So this was going on with the police officers
00:04:44,00:04:51,What's happening and then suddenly this curtain would raise and this furious glowing skeleton would be there saying you did it
00:04:51,00:04:59,Didn't you or whatever it would work so well the first time on I presume everyone who was who'd committed a crime and was trying
00:04:59,00:05:04,To cover it up isn't it's a very striking experience to have if you're the one being you know questioned by a skeleton
00:05:04,00:05:06,But I guess the criminal fraternity would would be more
00:05:06,00:05:11,"Yeah, we'll be blas√© about it after a few years of the skeleton being there. I would know about it"
00:05:11,00:05:15,"Wouldn't they yeah, they'd have to keep tracking it out and you know, different"
00:05:15,00:05:21,There's a detail in this which kind of confused me because this is the 1930s
00:05:21,00:05:26,Which said that as well as having the the megaphone and the glowing eyes it also had a camera in the head
00:05:26,00:05:33,Yes film would you get sound recording as well to record sound as well and it actually included a way of
00:05:33,00:05:40,"Recording the sound and the visuals at the same time onto this film. Yeah, that is very early"
00:05:41,00:05:45,"And we had cinema and stuff like that, so I think this it was a woman who did it wasn't it?"
00:05:45,00:05:48,Helen Adelaide Shelby. Yeah
00:05:48,00:05:52,"I think she basically took a load of things that have been invented around that time and said oh, we could do this with this"
00:05:52,00:05:56,"Oh, we could do this with this. Oh flashing lights. Let's do that for the eyes. Yeah"
00:05:56,00:06:01,One thing I couldn't find out was her decision to turn it into an interrogation thing
00:06:01,00:06:06,"Like that's quite a cool effect if you were like, oh, well, we could create this effect and put it on stage"
00:06:06,00:06:11,"What like did she just read a Christmas carol and was like, oh, I know what gets people guilty"
00:06:11,00:06:17,But that's the thing she's she doesn't come from that background. So it's Helena. Sorry not or Helena
00:06:17,00:06:24,Rather than Helen and she she was a real estate mogul. She was like she's the bed on horses
00:06:24,00:06:30,There's nothing else in the literature about her that suggests that this came from any background in policing or anything like that
00:06:30,00:06:32,And she kind of disappears as well. You don't really
00:06:34,00:06:36,I found that she did die in
00:06:36,00:06:40,1947 right I found in the newspapers when it expired
00:06:40,00:06:46,And I found that her father-in-law Samuel was a famous Civil War veteran
00:06:46,00:06:53,His first foray in the Civil War was down the Mississippi River and the entire platoon was hospitalized because they all drank swamp water
00:06:53,00:06:58,That's all I found out. She had a husband called Edgar. Let's see how the other detail
00:07:03,00:07:10,"Yeah, it's all she's remembered for now is is mostly this doesn't think I I found out that Tom Scott the"
00:07:10,00:07:13,YouTuber had
00:07:13,00:07:22,recreated this oh this invention in 2020. So they recreated the actual skeleton and everything and did an experiment with three other people
00:07:22,00:07:25,where he left them alone with a cookie and
00:07:25,00:07:30,One of them had to steal the cookie and then he interrogated them and they didn't know what he was doing
00:07:30,00:07:32,So he was just like I'm trying out a new technique
00:07:33,00:07:35,and then he puts them in this room and
00:07:35,00:07:38,the first to
00:07:38,00:07:44,I've scared at first because they're in a dark room and they have no idea what to expect and then when the skin was it appears
00:07:44,00:07:46,They just crack up laughing
00:07:46,00:07:52,"You would though wouldn't you I mean I can imagine it being spooky at first, but I'd be far more scared of a dark room"
00:07:52,00:07:59,"Yeah, so you know the one-way mirror thing. Yeah, there's not actually there's no such thing as a one-way mirror"
00:07:59,00:08:01,"No, there is it's actually a window"
00:08:01,00:08:04,So that's the dullest fact I found at the course of research
00:08:04,00:08:09,"It's all about yeah lighting. Yeah, it's a window covered with highly reflective coating"
00:08:09,00:08:14,It's not a mirror. What makes the difference between them. Is it just because a mirror has like a
00:08:14,00:08:18,"Steel background. I think the mirror has the that yeah, it's like a properly opaque background"
00:08:18,00:08:23,Whereas with the one-way window as all the kids will be calling it
00:08:26,00:08:28,Oh
00:08:28,00:08:34,Because the lights are always off only in the room where the the senior cops are watching the questioning happen
00:08:34,00:08:36,But the lights are always dark in that way
00:08:36,00:08:41,"Yeah, if you turned on the lights in that room you'd see them the thing is that is you want people to think it's a mirror, right?"
00:08:41,00:08:45,"That's the whole point. Yeah, if you say we've got our window here"
00:08:45,00:08:50,"Then they're gonna go. Oh, I thought that was a mirror like you have to call it a mirror in order to keep up"
00:08:50,00:08:53,But everyone knows there are people behind there now. Do they yeah
00:08:53,00:08:56,"No, the question is you don't know whether there's someone behind there or not"
00:08:56,00:09:01,I can't believe they exist actually to the eggs. I've never been arrested. Have you been interrogated?
00:09:01,00:09:04,What did you do? I used to work in market research my first job and
00:09:04,00:09:10,"Wait, there was a market research house, which was in Slough, and I was conducting the surveys"
00:09:10,00:09:14,"How interesting the focus group stuff. Yeah, it was all one-on-one stuff"
00:09:14,00:09:18,It was with women between the age of 18 and 39 who had acid reflux and
00:09:19,00:09:23,They had to speak to me for an hour and a half each and I had to ask them all the questions about their
00:09:23,00:09:26,"Yeah, and do you watch them through a one-way mirror?"
00:09:26,00:09:31,There were there were there were people from I'm not gonna say which pharmaceutical giant for watching them through the window
00:09:31,00:09:35,The mirror whatever and they were in the they were in the next room and after the interview ended
00:09:35,00:09:38,I'd pop next door and I'd say was there anything else you wanted me to ask and they'd say yeah
00:09:38,00:09:45,"Can you just ask question 17 again? Okay, so this this woman middle-aged woman with acid reflux. Yeah, I'm talking to you"
00:09:45,00:09:50,"I'm here. There's a big window there. Yeah, I mean mirror. Yeah, does she is she thinking all the time?"
00:09:50,00:09:54,There's someone behind that or was the illusion kept the whole time
00:09:54,00:09:59,Because I reckon they wouldn't have no otherwise. What's the point? I think I saw I thought might have to say there might be people
00:09:59,00:10:04,"Oh, did you observing but don't you know don't worry about it. Just talk to me looking to my eyes"
00:10:04,00:10:09,"Yeah, were you good interviewer or bad interviewer like you get good cop and bad"
00:10:12,00:10:18,"No, honestly acid reflux is totally normal don't worry about it. You can tell me about it. You're a sick puppy and you're gonna burn"
00:10:18,00:10:22,Yeah
00:10:22,00:10:27,I was not a very good interview right and the weird thing was it was just two of us working on the case me and my boss and
00:10:27,00:10:31,After the fourth day of questioning sessions
00:10:31,00:10:36,We came down to breakfast at the sort of like premier room. We was doing whatever and we both had acid reflux
00:10:36,00:10:42,"No, and then it turns out there was another"
00:10:42,00:10:54,I once once in a focus group with with the with the windows thing
00:10:54,00:10:57,But we knew that they were people because you just know like oh well
00:10:57,00:10:59,Someone's got to watch it's just so you don't get distracted
00:10:59,00:11:04,But we had to play video games and give feedback on on the video games. I think it was little big planet
00:11:04,00:11:06,"Yeah, and I said there should be more interrogation"
00:11:06,00:11:12,I was wondering
00:11:12,00:11:19,What happens if you confess but the police of you confess to as a Catholic because obviously they can't pass on what
00:11:19,00:11:21,Confessions that but it doesn't really
00:11:21,00:11:29,Like it's a priest cop that's the pitch of the TV series. He's a priest by day
00:11:29,00:11:34,"He's a cop by night, you know, but the priest is not allowed to tell anyone what's in confessed, right, right?"
00:11:34,00:11:38,Because although when I was at school and I used to go to confession. We had good priests bad priests
00:11:38,00:11:46,"The bad priests used to rat on you all the time man. Yeah, also, there's that one-way mirror in the confession"
00:11:46,00:11:51,"Spooky images in Catholic churches, they do you know"
00:11:51,00:12:00,"Growing red eyes, but this is the way that so I think in I think they're all"
00:12:00,00:12:06,So in confession booths the rule is that the priest can't disclose anything to anyone. That's how I understand
00:12:06,00:12:07,"Yeah, but there is some leeway"
00:12:07,00:12:12,"I think if there's so like if Dan I'm the priest, right Dan comes into the booth and he says"
00:12:12,00:12:15,I'm going to kill James in fact number two
00:12:15,00:12:20,"So if notice it sings a fish, right? I think I am allowed as the priest"
00:12:20,00:12:25,I think some schools of thought say I am allowed to go to the police and say you might want to check on James check
00:12:25,00:12:30,"He's all right. Yeah, you might be a threat to him at some point, but I'm not allowed to say Dan is going to kill him"
00:12:30,00:12:35,"Yeah, yeah, same with psychiatry, right when you admit"
00:12:35,00:12:38,You know planning to murder James
00:12:38,00:12:42,It took me a long time to get that out in the sessions
00:12:42,00:12:47,Just kill him
00:12:47,00:12:50,What are you waiting for?
00:12:50,00:12:52,"But they're allowed to pass on active threats, aren't they?"
00:12:52,00:12:58,It must be able to. There must be vanishingly few cases of people in confession booths or therapy sessions saying like this is the time
00:12:58,00:13:00,Place I'm going to commit the moida
00:13:00,00:13:04,I don't think it happens much. I like that you tried to make it a lighter thing by
00:13:04,00:13:09,This has gone a bit dark. Let's say moida
00:13:09,00:13:20,Music is often used in interrogation tactics. That's a big thing metal music particularly we've heard about that
00:13:20,00:13:27,"Oh, and like one time. Oh, yeah, and John Ronson wrote about the fact that like Barney music would be played the Barney the purple dinosaur"
00:13:27,00:13:34,I love you you love that song over and over to to make people go insane ever play the blobby Christmas number one
00:13:34,00:13:38,I bet they have I bet they have it's seen as torture
00:13:38,00:13:45,But um one band that gets used a lot as Metallica and Metallica hate it because you know as any musician would have this opinion
00:13:45,00:13:50,It's that music and politics music and in you know interrogation and questionable torture
00:13:50,00:13:56,"Shouldn't be mixed. I wouldn't say all musicians think that but well, yeah, I imagine most of them"
00:13:56,00:14:01,I think there is a band in the States a Christian rock band that were like you can use our music demon hunters
00:14:01,00:14:05,I think the demon hunter. It's not cool. It's not quite yeah
00:14:05,00:14:11,So Metallica asked for their music not to be used which it wasn't there was an interview with the guy who has claimed that he killed
00:14:11,00:14:12,Summer bin Laden
00:14:12,00:14:19,I don't know if that ever was confirmed the seal six team and he said that Metallica reached out to them and said can you not use our music and
00:14:19,00:14:26,Demon hunter he claimed then got piped up and said you can have our music. It's fine. And here's some patches demon hunter came out and said
00:14:26,00:14:31,"Actually, that's not the case. We didn't know what it was being used for. They just said they like playing our music"
00:14:31,00:14:33,They made their own patches. So supposedly a demon
00:14:33,00:14:41,"They only yeah, military would like to wear lots of different patches like the scouts"
00:14:41,00:14:48,You're killing oh summer bin Laden bud
00:14:48,00:14:50,Oh
00:14:50,00:14:58,One of the most feared
00:14:58,00:15:04,Nazi interrogators was a guy called Hans Schaaf in the second one bore and he was not he wasn't a soldier
00:15:04,00:15:07,He was a Polish born. Thank you as a farmer. He lived in South Africa
00:15:07,00:15:10,but he was fluent in English and if you were an
00:15:10,00:15:13,Pilot or air crew and you were caught
00:15:14,00:15:17,You would go to this little town near Frankfurt and you'll be put up in
00:15:17,00:15:23,Reasonably nice digs and they just talked to you for a couple of weeks and Hans Schaaf was the one leading these efforts
00:15:23,00:15:29,And they would present you with this incredible dossier. They'd say here are all your unit members names. Here's your home base
00:15:29,00:15:30,Here's the commander's dog's name
00:15:30,00:15:37,Here's the pub that you guys all drink in when and they just they would present you tiny fragments of information that made you think
00:15:37,00:15:39,They knew absolutely everything
00:15:39,00:15:44,You were likely to talk and give away secrets of you know wish what the weaknesses of your planes or whatever it might be
00:15:44,00:15:50,But the son the incredibly weird things that Hans Schaaf after the Second World War. He went to work at Disneyland
00:15:50,00:15:58,He became a mosaic artist and he did Cinderella's castle at Disney or Disney World. I think in Florida
00:15:58,00:16:02,"Yeah, that is do you know what though if I worked in"
00:16:02,00:16:07,Nazi interrogation that I want to go off and then work in a magical wonderland
00:16:08,00:16:15,"Art like you've heard that. Yeah, that's amazing. Yeah, I just imagine the interview where they want to find a mosaic maker"
00:16:15,00:16:17,"They're like, well, what did you do in your previous job?"
00:16:17,00:16:35,"Okay, it is time for fact number two and that is my fact my fact this week is that in real life"
00:16:35,00:16:41,The author of Charlotte's web became the foster parent to the spider children. He based Charlotte on
00:16:41,00:16:49,"So spider dad spider dad. Yeah, by spider children mean the children of a spider or not"
00:16:49,00:16:59,So Eby white author of Charlotte's web who also penned the classic Stuart Little and quite a few
00:17:00,00:17:06,Bigger adult books as well the elements of style and is sex necessary which he wrote with James Thurver
00:17:06,00:17:08,These were huge books back in the day
00:17:08,00:17:14,He loved animals and Charlotte of Charlotte's web is based on a real spider that he'd seen
00:17:14,00:17:19,He'd spotted it one autumn in 1949 and he came back later and the spider was gone and
00:17:19,00:17:25,The sack of the eggs were still sitting in the web and he thought okay
00:17:25,00:17:29,I'm gonna collect that so he took it down and he put it into a box and he goes to New York
00:17:29,00:17:35,And he travels with this and he has it in his office and the eggs survived and and they came out these spiders and started
00:17:35,00:17:42,Crawling over his office and they even had their web shoot up and they saw them flying across the office and he thought this is great
00:17:42,00:17:44,I'm just gonna let them do what they do and so for weeks
00:17:44,00:17:49,"They just made home on his desk in his office. It's his flat. I think it was yeah, yeah"
00:17:49,00:17:53,"Sorry, New York and and it wasn't until his cleaner came along who just went. I'm sorry"
00:17:53,00:17:57,I can't clean everything but the spiders that are infesting this room
00:17:57,00:18:01,That actually then they were murdered. What did she not walk around?
00:18:01,00:18:04,I don't know. I guess my cleaner doesn't kill my cat every time she comes around
00:18:04,00:18:09,She could work around the spider. You don't have hundreds of cats the size of a tiny eyelash
00:18:09,00:18:14,"I don't know. It feels like she could work around the spiders. Yeah, you'd think so, but she she complained"
00:18:14,00:18:19,He said fine. You can you can kill them and don't have a cleaner. Jeez. I don't have a cleaner
00:18:19,00:18:22,That's how you not get your spider children buried
00:18:23,00:18:29,"Yeah, yeah, so yeah, but it's quite nice to know that we never knew the fate of Charlotte the spider itself"
00:18:29,00:18:32,I believe I would have died exactly the species
00:18:32,00:18:39,"Yeah, we only live for a year don't they it's but if it's bound spider. Yeah, it's quite a good bond spider"
00:18:39,00:18:43,That's what that was. I think was it? It's got a scientific name. I didn't see
00:18:43,00:18:47,"Oh, yeah, but I didn't even know there was a common name of a barn spider. I've heard of the house by the though"
00:18:47,00:18:55,"So the spiders called Charlotte covac covatica. Yeah, and it's covatica. Maybe the scientific name it is"
00:18:55,00:18:59,So Charlotte a covatica and the a is a shortened scientific word
00:18:59,00:19:04,So Rainer's I think right Aranis I might be pronouncing that wrong Uranus
00:19:04,00:19:09,Sorry just to put you a cap of the charlotte's web
00:19:09,00:19:15,"So there's a pig and a spider. Yeah, and the spider saves the pigs life by spinning words into the web"
00:19:15,00:19:21,"Yeah, someone's gonna kill the pig the farm is gonna kill the pig farm is gonna kill big pig right at the beginning of the book"
00:19:21,00:19:25,"I think and then yeah, and Charlotte and the pig have an unlikely friendship"
00:19:25,00:19:30,"Hmm, it is weird that as a farmer you would see the words written in the web and think this pig is incredible"
00:19:39,00:19:44,So is I actually didn't write down his full first two names eb
00:19:44,00:19:49,"Elwin Brooks elwin Brooks. Thank you. Yeah. Yeah, so eb is elwin Brooks"
00:19:49,00:19:53,But actually went by the name Andy his whole life
00:19:53,00:19:58,"Yeah, and it's a really odd reason he went to Cornell University"
00:19:58,00:20:00,And there's a tradition at Cornell
00:20:00,00:20:06,Which is if you happen to have shared the surname of the person who was the co-founder and the first president of Cornell
00:20:06,00:20:11,Who was a guy called Andrew Dixon white then you had to just be called Andy?
00:20:11,00:20:18,Because he was called Andy. So they showed the so they bite and and so he got given that at Cornell and then the rest of his life
00:20:18,00:20:21,That's what it's what his wife called him. It's what his friends. It's what his colleagues
00:20:21,00:20:26,I'm just that still happens at Cornell if you had surname white that you get nicknamed Andy
00:20:26,00:20:30,"You know, it was a real pig as well as a real spider"
00:20:30,00:20:35,"Yeah, so he it's a lot of it's really drawn from life because he he lived in"
00:20:36,00:20:44,Maine on a lovely farm and he just as Dan said he connected with nature a lot and he almost preferred his farm to we definitely preferred his farm to city life
00:20:44,00:20:49,but he kept a pig and in 1948 so
00:20:49,00:20:52,three or four years before writing Charlotte's web
00:20:52,00:20:56,He wrote the essay death of a pig which is all about a pig
00:20:56,00:20:59,he'd been planning to slaughter which then got very ill and
00:20:59,00:21:02,"The pig had erycepolis, which is a"
00:21:03,00:21:04,condition
00:21:04,00:21:09,"Erycepolis. Yeah, erycepolis. It's a skin condition Dan Finsley couldn't pronounce a few years ago on this podcast"
00:21:09,00:21:14,"Yeah, and it's dangerous because it can transfer to people as well"
00:21:14,00:21:16,It's a friend of the podcast
00:21:16,00:21:24,And he wrote I discovered that once one has given a pig and enema there is no turning back
00:21:24,00:21:27,The pigs lot and mine were inextricably bound now. Oh
00:21:27,00:21:32,So you had to give the pig a medical enema at one point or another and it really brought them closer together
00:21:33,00:21:38,"Sure, I love everything I've read about EBY. I love he just seems such a dork"
00:21:38,00:21:43,He would have been perfect. I think on this podcast like here's a here's an example of how dorky he was
00:21:43,00:21:51,So he fell in love with this girl called Catherine sergeant angle who was a fiction editor who worked at the New Yorker
00:21:51,00:21:58,"And that's he was a writer for the New Yorker. She was married at the time. Yeah, that's right. Yeah, and they they eloped and"
00:21:59,00:22:07,"They had uh, you know, they had their marriage and then he said later on I soon realized I'd made no mistake in my choice of wife"
00:22:07,00:22:12,I was helping her pack an overnight bag one afternoon when she said put in some tooth twine
00:22:12,00:22:17,I knew then that a girl who called dental floss tooth twine was the girl for me
00:22:17,00:22:20,"Oh, that's so sweet"
00:22:20,00:22:28,"Well, I uh, I quite enjoyed finding out that when someone asked him why he wrote charlotte's web"
00:22:28,00:22:33,"He said, uh, I haven't told why I wrote the book, but I haven't told you why I sneeze either"
00:22:33,00:22:35,and a book is a sneeze
00:22:35,00:22:42,"That is his uh, yeah, he doesn't know why inside you and you just have to you have a story inside you and you have to"
00:22:42,00:22:45,"Share it with the world. Yeah, I guess it leaves your body at 17 miles an hour. Yeah"
00:22:45,00:22:49,"And if you keep your eyes open when you're right in the book, they will pop out"
00:22:49,00:22:56,Did you see that letter that a little girl wrote to him asking him why it was nine years after charlotte's web had come out
00:22:56,00:23:01,And she said when's the next book coming out and he replied I would like to write another book for children
00:23:01,00:23:07,But I spend all my spare time just answering letters. I get from children about the books. I have already written
00:23:07,00:23:16,So it looks like a hopeless situation unless you can start a movement in america called don't write to eb white until he produces another book
00:23:16,00:23:19,That's harsh that isn't it? Yeah
00:23:19,00:23:24,But that is like the that is exactly the sort of reply that I end up start doing on twitter
00:23:26,00:23:30,"Like with the reply guys and stuff. I'm like, oh, I'm just running out of patience now"
00:23:30,00:23:35,"Do you reply to reply guys? I used to really don't don't bother now. No, no, no"
00:23:35,00:23:41,"No, I've never heard that term. Is that just people who reply no matter what? Well, no, it's it's it's quite a sex-specific thing, isn't it?"
00:23:41,00:23:48,"Yeah, well, general generally reply guys tend to be due to reply to women to and in my case"
00:23:48,00:23:52,Explain our own jokes to us or why they might be better somehow
00:23:52,00:23:54,in addition to something
00:23:54,00:23:56,often incorrect
00:23:56,00:24:00,Have you thought of trying harder?
00:24:00,00:24:06,He had a really interesting process for writing eb white
00:24:06,00:24:10,So he could never listen to music because that would be it would get his attention
00:24:10,00:24:16,Diverted and that and that's I think quite famous for any writer anything with lyrics get that away
00:24:16,00:24:20,But what he did used to do was sit in the bit of his house that had the most traffic in it
00:24:20,00:24:27,"So his wife passing through his kids passing through whoever was in the house. Yeah, not like cars and stuff. No, exactly"
00:24:27,00:24:29,But like just yeah foot traffic
00:24:29,00:24:34,From his family. I think that's crazy. I agree. I think that's really difficult to concentrate when there's so much happening
00:24:34,00:24:38,"Yeah, it's that must be one of the most unusual writing methods"
00:24:38,00:24:40,Anyone's any writers ever heard. Yeah
00:24:40,00:24:46,Like Dan Brown hangs upside down or something to write that sounds like a dr. Zeus book
00:24:46,00:24:48,Dan Brown
00:24:49,00:24:55,"Yeah, he would do that if he had if he just needed thinking time he would hang upside down"
00:24:55,00:24:57,I don't think he physically
00:24:57,00:25:03,"Because the pen just wouldn't work after exactly we might have a space pen. Oh, yeah. Yeah on this anti-gravity or a pencil"
00:25:03,00:25:07,"You know, uh, stew at little. Yeah, man. Oh, yeah. What is it? What is it though? Best friend a mouse, right?"
00:25:07,00:25:14,"And was they right? I mean wrong. Oh, he's not a mouse. He's not even a mouse. Is he a doormouse?"
00:25:14,00:25:21,"No, no, he's so he's he's a child. He looks small. He looks like a mouse. What? Oh, right?"
00:25:21,00:25:23,Really? It's very weird. No in the book
00:25:23,00:25:28,"Yeah, in the book it's described as because he's he's given birth to by his human parents"
00:25:28,00:25:31,And they say and the book says he's the size of a mouse
00:25:31,00:25:35,"And he he has all the characteristics of a mouse, but he is"
00:25:35,00:25:42,He's quite indeterminate as species. So in the book it's not illustrated as it or is it?
00:25:42,00:25:49,I don't know if the original edition was illustrated because in charlotte's web the illustrator wanted to give the spider
00:25:49,00:25:55,"human woman facial features terrifying. Yeah, and uh, and they were like, no"
00:25:55,00:25:59,"She just looked like a spider and so that was just a spider, but in the animated film"
00:25:59,00:26:05,She was given a face given. She's got a lady face. Maybe that's why because he hated the movie didn't he?
00:26:05,00:26:10,"Yeah, he saw it and I guess like a lot of children's authors like pl travers seeing mary poppins the movie"
00:26:11,00:26:17,"Hated the way that their work is translated. Um, he hated charlotte's web. Um, that might be the reason"
00:26:17,00:26:20,But this kind of makes sense that maybe stewart little wasn't
00:26:20,00:26:23,A mouse because he did have a bit of a bugbear about
00:26:23,00:26:28,When people made animals a bit more human-like rather than like charlotte's web
00:26:28,00:26:30,It was a pig and it was a spider
00:26:30,00:26:35,Whereas he can never understand mickey mouse and donald duck and say why are they driving a car the hell's going on there?
00:26:35,00:26:41,You feel like the mouse a mouse doesn't drive a car because I haven't read this book because his spider quite realistic
00:26:41,00:26:43,like band spider female band spiders will
00:26:43,00:26:50,Stick some like silk out of their bum and then walk around and that's got like pheromones on it
00:26:50,00:26:52,"And then the males will follow her around. Oh, there's a whole chapter about this"
00:26:52,00:26:58,"It's where the spider babies come from brilliant. Yeah, but he did use a lot of technical terms"
00:26:58,00:27:05,He explained like the different bits of like that. He was very he researched spiders for ages to get all of the understanding
00:27:05,00:27:10,"So when you read it you get an understanding about like, you know, this bit of the leg is called this this bit of the hand"
00:27:10,00:27:12,The end
00:27:12,00:27:20,"He um, he was incredibly shy as well. He'd be white. He was very he's very anxious guy about not pretty much everything"
00:27:20,00:27:25,"Um, when he when he worked at the new yorker, he would sometimes go out of the fire escape if someone"
00:27:25,00:27:30,"He didn't know turned up at the office. Oh, he'd just pop out, you know of the window effectively"
00:27:30,00:27:36,"Wow, um, he skipped. Well anytime it was someone he didn't know at the office or someone who's coming to talk to him"
00:27:36,00:27:40,"I think probably someone coming to take office, isn't it? He wouldn't have done everything done. Yeah, you're right"
00:27:40,00:27:43,"Um, please give me it just sounds like someone who's smoking and try"
00:27:43,00:27:47,"Yeah, he skipped parties"
00:27:47,00:27:51,He skipped his the burial service of his wife of many decades
00:27:51,00:27:56,He skipped the presidential medal of freedom awards ceremony where jfk was trying to give him a medal
00:27:56,00:28:00,The national medal for literature award. He skipped that too. He just did not want to go out
00:28:00,00:28:06,"He was shy around women, wasn't he? Was he? Um, yeah, he once said I have too small a heart and too large a pen"
00:28:07,00:28:10,And it feels like he forgets we have the bad sense of it
00:28:10,00:28:19,"Yeah, he his wife even when he was communicating sort of love notes and stuff"
00:28:19,00:28:24,He would still even hide behind an animal persona. I don't think he was a furry. I think he just didn't
00:28:24,00:28:27,"Yeah, I don't think anyone thinks"
00:28:27,00:28:30,But you thought that
00:28:30,00:28:34,"Actually, he wasn't a fairy. He was a human with the characteristics of a fairy"
00:28:36,00:28:38,"Yeah, um, this is all by the way"
00:28:38,00:28:41,It's a guy called michael simms who wrote this amazing biography on him
00:28:41,00:28:47,Who discovered that charlotte was based on a real spider found out this story about the the eggsack and he did an interview on npr
00:28:47,00:28:52,"Where I was reading this on and um, he said that when it came to the audiobook the death scene"
00:28:52,00:28:55,So spoiler alert charlotte dies in the book
00:28:55,00:28:59,"Um, he found it impossible to read the death scene"
00:28:59,00:29:05,Out loud and according to the producer it took him 17 takes in order to get it out finally
00:29:06,00:29:08,"Uh, he said they would how many takes did your book take that?"
00:29:08,00:29:12,I was just crying the whole way through you shouldn't have put the word erycee plus in
00:29:12,00:29:19,But he would go out he would go out for walks would try and get himself together to go back in and do it
00:29:19,00:29:20,And he would say yeah
00:29:20,00:29:26,He's like this is ridiculous a grown man crying over the death of an imaginary insect go back in and then just start crying all over
00:29:26,00:29:28,"Not an insect, mate. Yeah"
00:29:32,00:29:40,"James is in the booth pressing of us and uh, maybe that's who's crying, you know the final light is and then the insect died"
00:29:40,00:29:53,It is time for fact number three and that is andy my fact is that one of the world's best dance choreographers is called
00:29:53,00:29:56,Mr. Millipede
00:29:56,00:30:00,"Um, I should say this was sent in by a listener"
00:30:00,00:30:05,"So thank you to Maggie Mortensen who sent it in. Um, yeah, and uh, mr. Millipede. I think he's Benjamin"
00:30:05,00:30:11,"Yes, and no now james is looking. It's giving me a look millipede. Is it millipede?"
00:30:11,00:30:15,"It's how he would pronounce it. It's how he would pronounce it, but it's not how I'm pronouncing it"
00:30:15,00:30:22,"He's not on this podcast. So no, but it's it's millipede. Yeah, it translates into french as a thousand feet, right? Yeah, there we go"
00:30:22,00:30:27,"Um, I've seen newspaper articles interviewing him who call him the man with a thousand feet"
00:30:28,00:30:33,"Really? Yeah, that's great. I think because he dances so well. It's almost as if he has a thousand feet"
00:30:33,00:30:36,"Maybe yeah, I get a lot harder to dance"
00:30:36,00:30:40,"It would be yeah if two left feet, but you've got like what 500"
00:30:40,00:30:48,"And this is just a fact about someone with an amusing name in the world of dance. Hmm. Yeah, no one is to have determinism"
00:30:48,00:30:52,"Yeah, yeah, I went to school with a girl called erin trimmer who became a hairdresser"
00:30:52,00:30:55,Nice
00:30:55,00:30:56,Brilliant
00:30:56,00:30:58,Shout out to erin trimmer
00:30:58,00:31:04,"So mr. Millipede, uh, is he's quite notable in the world of hollywood. He has choreographed a lot of movies"
00:31:04,00:31:10,He's done june the first june movie. He did the choreograph for the um for the giant worm dance. giant millipede
00:31:10,00:31:12,"Yeah, the big millipede that comes out"
00:31:12,00:31:16,There's a dance in there. I believe I haven't seen the movie myself. Yes. There's there's a dance
00:31:16,00:31:19,There's a cool shifting dance over the sand
00:31:19,00:31:23,We sashay to avoid attracting the attention of the big old worms that live in the desert
00:31:23,00:31:29,Because they feel the vibrations of your feet they sense movement for them and they're incredibly sensitive to it
00:31:29,00:31:33,"But if you walk in a particular way then well, they won't spot you. Is it a dance or is it just someone walking?"
00:31:33,00:31:36,"Well, it's a gate, you know a gate"
00:31:36,00:31:41,"I'm not seeing june, but I imagined that it was like a bit in the movie where they're like"
00:31:41,00:31:43,And now we do the word
00:31:43,00:31:50,"Everybody joins in and they're like it's just a step to the left. Yeah, basically it's I'm imagining"
00:31:50,00:31:52,"Yeah, mr. Millipede comes running out in leotard"
00:31:52,00:31:56,"It's like a Jane Fonda video. Yeah. Um, but he also did black swan"
00:31:56,00:32:01,Which was the ballet movie and it was on that movie that he met his future wife
00:32:01,00:32:06,"Natalie Portman. So yeah, mr. Millipede is married to Natalie Portman"
00:32:06,00:32:08,Just some hot goss
00:32:08,00:32:16,"Great yeah, yeah, they split up though because he's got together with one of the worms from dune"
00:32:19,00:32:27,"Yeah, um, but no just uh ballet unless anyone's got anything more on on benny mill. Um, mr. Millipede has got a tattoo on his abdomen"
00:32:27,00:32:34,"Of a bow house symbol, which I think is quite cool. You know the german architecture thing"
00:32:34,00:32:40,It's a it's like a profile of a face uh designed by a painter called oska schlemmer
00:32:40,00:32:49,And oska schlemmer is really cool. He was he had five of his artworks in the nazi organized degenerative art exhibition
00:32:49,00:32:53,In munich. Do you know about that? So they piled up a load of art
00:32:53,00:32:59,"Well, basically they the nazis decided and hitler especially because he was he thought of himself as an artist"
00:32:59,00:33:06,They got a load of like german artworks that showed the greatness of germany and put them all in an amazing museum
00:33:06,00:33:12,"And then down the road they got all the stuff that they really hated and said this is all degenerate this, you know"
00:33:12,00:33:14,"And I mean, which one would you rather see? Yeah"
00:33:14,00:33:19,Like it's I would so much tragic but front to yet another hitler watercolor
00:33:19,00:33:22,exactly
00:33:22,00:33:25,But yeah schlemmer had a load of stuff there and then they had loads of rooms
00:33:25,00:33:28,Like a lot of them were quite anti-semitic the names of the rooms and stuff
00:33:28,00:33:32,"But um, they had some that was like an insult to german womanhood"
00:33:32,00:33:35,And then they'd have a load of paintings that were insulting german women
00:33:35,00:33:42,"And then madness becomes method and nature as seen by sick minds. Oh, yeah, these do sound quite like quite cool"
00:33:42,00:33:44,Yeah
00:33:44,00:33:53,"Very nice. Anyway, that's just a thing about Bauhaus. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Um the movie black swan just very quickly while we're still on millipede"
00:33:53,00:33:58,There was a lot of controversy about the movie when Natalie Portman won the oscar for it because
00:33:58,00:34:02,"Well, there's a lot of scenes which is to do with really intensive amazing ballet dancing"
00:34:02,00:34:06,"And there was a stunt double Natalie Portman was good at ballet, but she'd only done it for a year"
00:34:06,00:34:09,She wasn't at the level that you needed to be in order to pull those moves
00:34:09,00:34:14,"Um, but the person who played the stunt double didn't get any of the credit and there was a lot of questions about"
00:34:14,00:34:19,Whether or not best actor should be going to someone who is not necessarily
00:34:19,00:34:20,I can see that
00:34:20,00:34:25,"And there's a lot of emotional scenes in there and you know, so there's a lot of acting that goes on so it's justified"
00:34:25,00:34:27,I feel like it should be a joint thing
00:34:27,00:34:32,"Yeah, like if you win best actor for a particular role then anyone else in the film"
00:34:32,00:34:37,"That had to play whether it's a stunt double or a stand in or something. Yes, they should all get on stage"
00:34:37,00:34:42,"They share it, but if it's someone doing the back of your head for a day where you were busy shooting a different sequence"
00:34:42,00:34:45,"But they can come on stage, but they have to show only the back of their head"
00:34:45,00:34:48,Zyruska Statue is only the back of the oscar's head
00:34:48,00:34:54,And and they all have to dress in whatever the actor is wearing. They're all wearing the same outfit
00:34:54,00:34:58,So we change it from the nominations being the actor's names to the character name of the movie
00:34:58,00:35:03,Therefore you can have multiple people character is a really good category. I really like that
00:35:03,00:35:09,"Yeah, and then, you know, then it's not as problematic when people eventually do something that makes you go. Oh"
00:35:09,00:35:14,"Oh, I don't like them anymore. Yeah. Oh, I still like that character. Yeah, that's true"
00:35:14,00:35:19,"Interestingly, last thing on black swan black swan was made by Darren Aronofsky the director"
00:35:19,00:35:22,And he also made the wrestler with Mickey Rourke
00:35:22,00:35:27,And initially black swan and the wrestler were meant to be one movie where a ballet dancer fell in love with the wrestler
00:35:27,00:35:30,And that was the initial movie. It was meant to be one
00:35:31,00:35:35,Cinematic universe combination and then you just split it into two movies. That's a brilliant
00:35:35,00:35:39,What I would have loved to watch it would mr. Milipede also choreographed
00:35:39,00:35:43,"Yeah, the wrestling was pro ballet is fake"
00:35:43,00:35:50,"There's a thing called beat deafness. Have you heard of this? No, it's like I've got it. Yeah. Do you think no?"
00:35:50,00:35:54,I'm sure you don't it's like tone deafness only
00:35:54,00:36:00,"You can't dance. It's quite rare dancing well is subjective. Isn't it really? Yeah, it is"
00:36:01,00:36:06,"It is I'm more talking about being in rhythm. So they would they'd watch strictly come dancing for example and be like, wow"
00:36:06,00:36:12,"Why are they not in time to the band? It's that yeah, well, they would just it would be completely alien to them"
00:36:12,00:36:16,"It would be they wouldn't think they're out of time or they're in time. They would just be like, well, I don't know"
00:36:16,00:36:21,What's going on here? He's just moving his arms and there's music playing but I can't put the two together
00:36:21,00:36:25,"Right. What if anyone famous has that? Hmm. I mean, I definitely can't keep to time"
00:36:25,00:36:28,I found that out by trying to learn the drums
00:36:28,00:36:35,And after many lessons and a very patient teacher realized I just can't keep to time. I always get faster
00:36:35,00:36:39,Always all the time. And I the thing is I love like I love dancing and stuff
00:36:39,00:36:44,I did dance in high school. I saw a video and I am clearly half a beat behind everyone else
00:36:44,00:36:48,"Like it's yeah, yeah, I've just had to what kind of dancing was it?"
00:36:48,00:36:55,"Uh, um, I did uh interpretive because uh, it's a lot harder to prove wrong"
00:36:56,00:37:03,"Yeah, that's the best there are some dances that it's clear if you're a beat behind if you do the oki-koki and your arms in when everyone else is out"
00:37:03,00:37:08,That's really obvious because you'd have to do like group ones as well. And that that that was more like modern dance
00:37:08,00:37:12,"Or whatever. Yeah, so that one was one I was always out. Yeah. Yeah"
00:37:12,00:37:15,I'd love to see just videos of that where someone doesn't know
00:37:15,00:37:18,"Hi. Yeah, so we're actually on knees not shoulders"
00:37:21,00:37:28,Didn't you do a bit of dance me? Yeah you where I'm thinking of your school because you went to a very interesting school
00:37:28,00:37:34,"Oh, yeah, yeah, we went to a riddle steiner school. We did urythmi, which is a dance invented by riddle steiner"
00:37:34,00:37:37,"Yeah, so you used to go it was I you know, it's very kind to call it a dance"
00:37:37,00:37:41,What it is is you just give it given a pole and you have to walk forwards and backwards just
00:37:41,00:37:47,"Moving the pole from vertical to horizontal a metal pole. Yeah, it would be disappointing if you go to see a pole dancer and that's"
00:37:49,00:37:52,Damn telling you about the yeti while he walks back and forwards
00:37:52,00:37:56,"Um ballet moves. Oh, yeah. Did you know one of the most iconic?"
00:37:56,00:37:59,sports logos of all time
00:37:59,00:38:02,Is a ballet move
00:38:02,00:38:10,"Yeah, try and guess it. Oh, oh, I think I know. Yeah, there we go. Yeah, Michael Jordan the famous. Can we keep guessing?"
00:38:10,00:38:14,"Sorry, sorry"
00:38:14,00:38:17,"Sorry, go for it. Go for it. I was thinking the olympic rings. Yeah, no clothes"
00:38:18,00:38:20,clothes
00:38:20,00:38:22,"Do you want it one more? No, no"
00:38:22,00:38:26,"Yeah, so james is actually as I said earlier, correct"
00:38:26,00:38:31,The very iconic Michael Jordan looking like he's going for a dunk. So his arms are out
00:38:31,00:38:37,"He's got a ball in his hand legs are wide. It's not going for a dunk going for a dunk. Yeah, you go for a dunk. He's dunking"
00:38:37,00:38:39,"Okay, okay"
00:38:39,00:38:46,"Give it a few minutes. I've just been for a dunk. Uh, has it bounced off the backboard?"
00:38:46,00:38:48,Yeah
00:38:48,00:38:57,"Um, that's everyone assumes that that's him dunking. It's not he's in a photo shoot that he was doing with a guy called Peter Moore"
00:38:57,00:39:03,"Um, he did a ballet leap and that was caught in the photo and they thought that just looked so perfect a stance"
00:39:03,00:39:08,"For this logo. Did he know it was a ballet leap? Yeah, I believe so. Yeah"
00:39:08,00:39:10,I there's not there's not too much information on it
00:39:10,00:39:15,It's just from this guy Peter Moore who pointed out that when the photos were taken that's what was happening
00:39:15,00:39:17,So we know that it was specifically that
00:39:17,00:39:23,"Um, so yeah ballet in Michael Jordan land. I think I might be wrong about no"
00:39:23,00:39:24,I'm right about this
00:39:24,00:39:29,When my parents used to ask me what I wanted to be when I grow up until I was about seven or eight
00:39:29,00:39:31,I said I wanted to be a ballet dancer. Wow
00:39:31,00:39:35,"Ah legend and then I discovered football. Oh, you get to go on my list of"
00:39:35,00:39:40,"Uh famous people I'm calling you famous famous people who started off as uh,"
00:39:41,00:39:45,Ballerinas or I wouldn't say I started off as a ballerina. Um other people on the list
00:39:45,00:39:48,"Tupac. Oh, yeah, the rapper Tupac"
00:39:48,00:39:50,I did it with him. There you go
00:39:50,00:39:58,"Yeah Tupac was um, he he was the mouse king in the school play the nutcracker, but he actually studied interesting fact about the mouse king"
00:39:58,00:40:00,"Yeah, not a mouse"
00:40:00,00:40:02,That's the dimensions of a mouse
00:40:02,00:40:08,"Um, also on the list the Daleks from dr. Who bit of a stretch. No, not really they"
00:40:09,00:40:14,So Terry nation when he was designing the Daleks he was inspired by the soviet dance troupe
00:40:14,00:40:20,The georgian state ballet when they're performing in london and believe that that would be a perfect like he got looked at and went
00:40:20,00:40:24,"Wow, the way they glided he thought a Dalek would be a perfect way of doing that"
00:40:24,00:40:28,"Um, and so not only was that the inspiration"
00:40:28,00:40:36,But the very first people who sat inside the Daleks were dancers to help with the with the movement because they understood how to
00:40:36,00:40:38,"Yeah, use their feet"
00:40:38,00:40:40,You never see ballet dancers going upstairs
00:40:40,00:40:45,Exactly incapable of going upstairs. I think louis the
00:40:45,00:40:51,"Who's the sun king louis the fourth 14th? Yeah, he was into ballet and that's how he got called to sun king"
00:40:51,00:40:56,"It's named after a character in a in a ballet. I don't know which one. Yeah, he was massive into it"
00:40:56,00:41:00,"He used to like try and do the dances himself like dinners and stuff. Yeah, yeah"
00:41:01,00:41:08,So what were they called because I was reading that ballerina is the word that you would use for a female ballet person
00:41:08,00:41:10,Italian wouldn't it
00:41:10,00:41:15,So what what's the word? We don't have an english word for a male ballerino ballerino
00:41:15,00:41:21,"Ballerino, you know ballerino's. Yeah. Yeah ballerino. I thought I'd take us down a different"
00:41:21,00:41:24,"Laynote looking at ballet today. Um, and this was uh"
00:41:24,00:41:30,Quite recent the director of a leading german ballet company had to be investigated by police
00:41:30,00:41:35,"Because uh, he smeared a critic's face with feces with dog feces"
00:41:35,00:41:43,"Because she'd uh said too many bad things about um, his ballets. Yes, this is a terrible story. Yeah, it's a bit"
00:41:43,00:41:47,It was a it was a let's just a drive by
00:41:47,00:41:50,Who's a drive?
00:41:50,00:41:53,"I'll take some skills, isn't it? Just going for a dunk"
00:41:55,00:42:04,Like so very high passion. It was a critic the critic had written a very hostile reviews of the of the this particular ballet
00:42:04,00:42:07,It was a previous show. I think yeah in the dutch mountains
00:42:07,00:42:10,"It was called uh, which had been performed earlier"
00:42:10,00:42:14,Furious with the review that was given and they were putting on this new performance
00:42:14,00:42:18,What's interesting is I don't think he knew that she was going to be there on that night
00:42:18,00:42:22,"It just happened to have the dog poo at his pocket, which makes it more interesting if that's the case"
00:42:23,00:42:29,"Come on. No, it can't be true. You know, if he always have a dog with him, maybe like well, what's his dog's poo?"
00:42:29,00:42:33,"So I wonder if maybe he'd happen to have his dog with him at the time. Oh, god"
00:42:33,00:42:35,Crikey. Yeah
00:42:35,00:42:39,I won't lie. There's some there's some reviewers who I think probably
00:42:39,00:42:42,Wow
00:42:42,00:42:47,"There's the same names will bleep them out. Oh, no, it's a confessional space. You can say what you want"
00:42:47,00:42:52,"But if if I think there is a risk to them, I will have to what yeah, um"
00:42:53,00:42:55,one of the so the big I mean there's a huge
00:42:55,00:43:02,"I guess you'd say a sort of soft power thing for lots of I mean lots of very big eastern european ballet companies, especially russian"
00:43:02,00:43:08,So the bolshoi ballet is very very very famous russian ballet. This is interesting
00:43:08,00:43:12,"Again, it's people who you wouldn't think would were ballerinas, uh, but but were"
00:43:12,00:43:15,So have you seen diehard?
00:43:15,00:43:21,"Yes. Oh, yes. I yeah, so know about this. Yeah, this is um one of the henchmen in diehard"
00:43:22,00:43:30,"It's Carl. Okay. The big blonde guy gets shot. No, it's his brother. They get shot. Exactly. Exactly. He won best character in 1980"
00:43:30,00:43:32,I can't believe you don't remember this
00:43:32,00:43:34,16 people except at the end
00:43:34,00:43:41,"Carl Carl the huge blonde henchman who's extremely tough. He uh, he was a former principal lead dancer in the bolshoi ballet"
00:43:41,00:43:47,"Okay, uh, well, I because I've been to see a ball show in Moscow and the guys who do it"
00:43:47,00:43:52,"They're quite slim, but they're strong. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So strong a lot of strength. Yeah. Yeah"
00:43:52,00:43:55,And it also takes a lot of strength to defect which is what
00:43:55,00:43:58,"Is that what he did? Alexander got enough dead. Yeah, he was on tour in the usa"
00:43:58,00:44:06,Big big thing of ballet defections. Nuri is it ish the cuff. Was it the other guy? Rudolph Nuri defected at the airport
00:44:06,00:44:08,He was about to go back to the soviet union
00:44:08,00:44:14,He had his handlers from the kgb with him and he he he fled to the french police who were who were there at the airport
00:44:15,00:44:17,But he didn't do it. Like I don't think he did a cool move
00:44:17,00:44:34,"Okay, it is time for our final fact of the show that is james. Okay. My fact this week is that in 1997"
00:44:34,00:44:40,Mattel recalled one of its cabbage patch dolls because it's had started eating children
00:44:41,00:44:48,"I remember this see. Yeah. Yeah. Oh my god. Yeah, because I was a bit. I was really into cabbage patch kids"
00:44:48,00:44:54,"And um, and I remember that that was going that particular toy was going to be released in Australia"
00:44:54,00:45:00,"And then when they got recalled in the states, they never made it to Australia. How interesting I'd never heard of it before"
00:45:00,00:45:06,"But yeah, I mean it's incredible and when I say eating children it was only bits of children"
00:45:06,00:45:08,"It was eating. Yeah, I didn't manage a whole one"
00:45:08,00:45:13,It was a toy which had a mouth which you could feed food into
00:45:13,00:45:18,And it had a rucksack at the back and then you would feed them a cookie or something
00:45:18,00:45:24,And it would go through the body and then it would mysteriously arrive in the rucksack and and that would be the game
00:45:24,00:45:32,But children started putting their fingers into the mouths or the hair or whatever and there was really no way to stop it
00:45:32,00:45:35,I don't think kids were deliberately putting their hair in them. I think the hair was getting caught
00:45:36,00:45:39,The hair was getting caught. I can imagine them putting their fingers in deliberately
00:45:39,00:45:42,Someone with a one-year-old child that you know that might happen
00:45:42,00:45:45,"But anyway, once you put any part of your body into this mouth"
00:45:45,00:45:49,You couldn't get it out because these because behind the lips of the doll of these two
00:45:49,00:45:57,"These rollers right and they only rolled one way exactly. Yeah. Yeah, and they had um about 100 incidents reported"
00:45:57,00:46:04,In this christmas time it started off just a few and then suddenly like more and more and more people started saying
00:46:04,00:46:11,"Yeah, my kids are being eaten by this doll and just legally I I did find a claim by Mattel that these are all isolated incidents"
00:46:11,00:46:15,But that really raised a question of how many incidents do they have to be
00:46:15,00:46:17,Stop being isolated
00:46:17,00:46:21,"Exactly. Yeah, I mean they did sell many many"
00:46:21,00:46:27,Probably at least hundreds of thousands up. They sold a lot of them and so it's a very low percentage of children
00:46:27,00:46:31,"Who got eaten by these dolls one is too many, isn't it? Yeah, rather feels that way. Yeah"
00:46:32,00:46:35,"But yeah, cabbage patch kids. They're incredible. With these dolls"
00:46:35,00:46:39,There's there's an extraordinary thing that I never appreciated about cabbage patch dolls
00:46:39,00:46:46,Which is basically their handmade to be in each one is very different from like if not even the model
00:46:46,00:46:50,There's obviously different models within the models each one has differences in it because they are basically
00:46:50,00:46:53,"They're all supposed to be kind of unique. Yeah, like for instance"
00:46:53,00:46:56,I got one. Yes
00:46:56,00:47:00,"Oh, it's still in the box. Well, I only bought it yesterday"
00:47:01,00:47:05,This is not one that eats children. This is just a normal cabbage patch doll
00:47:05,00:47:12,Wow. Wow. And as you can see mine is called Leona Jade. How you've gone? Is it a ballerina?
00:47:12,00:47:19,"Yeah, she has like a little birth certificate and adoption papers and the idea is that they're all unique pretty much and"
00:47:19,00:47:25,"And that was different as well, wasn't it that you didn't buy it? You didn't buy a doll. You adopted a doll"
00:47:25,00:47:30,"Exactly. Oh, yeah. Oh, I've got them. I've got the birth certificates and everything. Yeah"
00:47:30,00:47:33,"Yeah, I had one called Alice who had"
00:47:33,00:47:38,Came with hair like products so you could style the hair it came with a little thing of hair spray
00:47:38,00:47:41,So you could do its hair and I wasn't a doll
00:47:41,00:47:46,Kid like I didn't like Barbies or anything like that. I was more into trolls
00:47:46,00:47:49,But but the cabbage patch kid. There was just something
00:47:49,00:47:53,About it. Did you do you know about the cute schema? No schema of cuteness
00:47:53,00:47:56,So there was a study done
00:47:57,00:48:01,"By a university in in japan, of course, they would study cuteness"
00:48:01,00:48:08,And it was to look at the things that we respond to as humans to decide that something is cute
00:48:08,00:48:11,So the the forehead is normally quite large big eyes
00:48:11,00:48:14,The eyes usually quite low on the forehead
00:48:14,00:48:17,and sort of chunky short
00:48:17,00:48:24,limbs and things and they believe that the reason that cabbage patch dolls became so popular
00:48:25,00:48:31,"And became like because they weren't they didn't do anything not like, you know before all of these the original ones didn't"
00:48:31,00:48:33,They didn't do anything. They didn't eat children
00:48:33,00:48:38,They think that the reason they went so big is because it violates the cute schema
00:48:38,00:48:40,So
00:48:40,00:48:44,"Oh, if you look at a cabbage patch doll, you'll notice that the eyes are actually quite small"
00:48:44,00:48:49,quite close together and so there's elements about them that are considered grotesque
00:48:50,00:48:57,But not enough I find I don't I don't I find a bit creepy and that's why because it divides people and people either think they're cute
00:48:57,00:49:02,"Or creepy and so people would talk about them because people go. Oh, they're so cute and other people go. No, no"
00:49:02,00:49:06,"They're really creepy. Yeah, and as we know from just the media today"
00:49:06,00:49:11,If you can cause a divide in public opinion people will talk and debate and argue
00:49:11,00:49:16,"Yeah, my um, yeah, my wife won't let me take this home. I bought it. I really really doesn't like it"
00:49:16,00:49:22,"Is this new was it like an ebay? It's brand new. No, I bought it. This was in a shop, right? Yeah. Yeah. So does anyone want one?"
00:49:22,00:49:27,I thought what we could give it away to one of our listeners
00:49:27,00:49:32,"Should we give it away to someone on club fish? I'm pretty sure I just claimed it, but yeah, no, of course, of course"
00:49:32,00:49:35,You should always give away adopted children
00:49:35,00:49:41,"It's just be a double adoption. Yeah. Yeah, let's do that. Okay. We'll work out a competition"
00:49:41,00:49:48,"Um, the thing about the sort of the look of the freakish look and so on that led to one of the great myths about cabbage patch kids"
00:49:48,00:49:51,"That circulated in the 80s, which I had"
00:49:51,00:49:58,"Reading this kind of makes me miss being a kid again and falling for these amazing legends. Dan, you still fall for these things"
00:49:58,00:49:59,"Yeah, that's true. That's true"
00:49:59,00:50:05,"But um, the the story was the reason they looked like that was because president of america at the time"
00:50:05,00:50:08,Ronald Reagan gave a directive to the makers of it to show
00:50:09,00:50:13,What we would look like following the survival of a nuclear holocaust
00:50:13,00:50:20,And to get us used to the idea that we're gonna look quite freakish and it would be normalized by the time it happened
00:50:20,00:50:26,"We would sort of accept it as normal humans being like that and that went around for it. Yeah, it's such a great story"
00:50:26,00:50:29,"But um, it it's you know, obviously not true, but that's really"
00:50:29,00:50:33,It's not true
00:50:33,00:50:36,That's so fun. I find everything about them a bit a bit rum. Yeah
00:50:36,00:50:42,"Well, did you guys read about the babyland general hospital? Yeah, was this one at some point? Well, actually it's mentioned on this box"
00:50:42,00:50:44,it says that um
00:50:44,00:50:48,There was a young boy called Xavier Roberts who discovered a magical cabbage patch
00:50:48,00:50:55,And he built babyland general hospital where his children now live and play until someone takes them home to care for them and love them
00:50:55,00:50:59,"Right and that sounds like just a bit of corporate guff. Yeah, actually. It's a real place"
00:51:00,00:51:05,"So he so he kind of well, we'll get on I'm sure we'll get on with the history of how they were originated"
00:51:05,00:51:10,"But in 1978, I think he opened up and I think it was a former medical facility"
00:51:10,00:51:16,He opened up babyland general hospital and you could go there as a punter and they held live births
00:51:16,00:51:19,At the hospital and there was a write-up on um slate
00:51:19,00:51:25,"Okay, every half hour or so an employee dressed as a doctor or nurse gets on the pa and announces there is a code green"
00:51:25,00:51:27,That means that mother cabbage is in labor
00:51:28,00:51:32,And it's time to head to the magical crystal tree to watch a baby being born
00:51:32,00:51:36,The birthing process lasts under three minutes. Uh-huh not realistic
00:51:36,00:51:43,Um a nurse in scrubs and latex gloves stands among the cabbages and tells the crowd that mother cabbage has dilated
00:51:43,00:51:45,The full 10 leaves apart
00:51:45,00:51:48,That's such a gag for the parents
00:51:48,00:51:52,"Like if you have no idea the parents are going to be like, oh, I see what they're saying"
00:51:52,00:51:57,"As the crystal well, there are very specific parent gags as the crystals at the base of the tree begin to glow"
00:51:57,00:52:03,The nurse gives the cabbage a shot of imagicillin and announces she will be performing an easyotomy
00:52:03,00:52:08,A pieziotomy gag there as opposed to a c-section which stands for cabbage section
00:52:08,00:52:14,The nurse gently spreads the cabbage leaves reaches in her gloved hands and slowly pulls out a naked doll
00:52:14,00:52:16,The kids in the crowd murmur gasp and applaud
00:52:16,00:52:19,People say that's creepy
00:52:20,00:52:22,"Oh, I'd love to see that"
00:52:22,00:52:27,But it was the whole story was one of the reasons the other reasons they became so popular because it
00:52:27,00:52:31,Rather than just being a doll. It was this whole
00:52:31,00:52:33,You're buying into the need us. Yeah
00:52:33,00:52:39,"Like you're actually adopting a thing, you know, the parents would be like, oh, that's a really cute idea and oh"
00:52:39,00:52:43,"Oh, my my kid could adopt a doll and stuff. And so yeah, and it worked"
00:52:43,00:52:48,That's amazing. It really did work because they were absolutely massive when they were when they first went out
00:52:48,00:52:55,"When was that going to be in like the 80s early 80s? Yeah, and there was riots when people were trying to get them in shops and"
00:52:55,00:52:59,"Um, I was reading some newspaper articles from the time"
00:52:59,00:53:02,About these riots that were happening in the in the states
00:53:02,00:53:10,"Um, the citizens voice newspaper. This was in pennsylvania one pregnant woman bit another patron and knocked his hat off"
00:53:10,00:53:13,I think she was just trying to eat a cookie
00:53:13,00:53:18,Another woman was punched in the face by a female shopper
00:53:18,00:53:21,One woman chased a man through a parking lot calling him an sob
00:53:21,00:53:28,The simi valley star from california said one woman was swinging a baseball bat wildly at other women
00:53:28,00:53:33,To get one of these dolls and it wasn't even the last doll in the shop that she was getting
00:53:33,00:53:37,Apparently because all these dolls are slightly different from each other
00:53:37,00:53:41,She'd seen one that she particularly wanted and she just didn't want anyone else to go near them
00:53:41,00:53:43,So she was swinging the baseball bats
00:53:43,00:53:46,And in 2008
00:53:46,00:53:53,Four kids entertainment Inc who at the time on the license for these they released a special edition of the dolls to commemorate the riots
00:53:53,00:53:56,"Oh, wow"
00:53:56,00:54:00,"And did it come with riots? No, it was just like riot gear"
00:54:00,00:54:07,They've become slightly different over the years like this is the one that i've got here is a bit more
00:54:07,00:54:12,Finally and a bit more toy-like than the originals the ones that they did to commemorate. They were
00:54:13,00:54:16,"Um more close to the originals. Yeah, you can see I mean it's you know"
00:54:16,00:54:20,It's since becoming a parent and understanding the christmas rush to get toys
00:54:20,00:54:26,"You can understand why movies like jingle all the way are so you know, Arnold Schwarzenegger's most relatable movie"
00:54:26,00:54:34,"It's that was all about a toy. Have you not seen it a relatable movie? Absolutely. No, I never think of a more than cold in the barbarian"
00:54:34,00:54:38,"Yeah, yeah, even more than kind of neither more than julia even more than terminator. Yeah"
00:54:40,00:54:43,It's more than more than can be gone and call terminator three rise of the machines
00:54:43,00:54:46,"No, no"
00:54:46,00:54:53,So zavia roberts the person who invented he's mentioned on the side of the box and correct in your
00:54:53,00:54:57,controversial highly controversial
00:54:57,00:54:59,21 year old art student when he first
00:54:59,00:55:07,Notices that there is a german technique king of needle molding and he sees a lady called martha nelson who is
00:55:08,00:55:12,Making these doll babies and he goes oh that looks really interesting
00:55:12,00:55:17,"She has adoption papers for the babies. Um, she has original names for the babies"
00:55:17,00:55:20,He goes off changes the technique ever so slightly
00:55:20,00:55:26,But it was very much lifted from what this woman was doing and then he kind of went off and ran with it and got all the
00:55:26,00:55:31,"Credit for creating this new style of doll. Yeah, because basically she made this doll, right?"
00:55:31,00:55:34,She was selling them to him because he owned a gift shop
00:55:34,00:55:39,And then he wanted to up the price. She refused and so refused to give him any more dolls
00:55:39,00:55:43,"And so he said well, I'm just going to make them myself then basically that's what happened"
00:55:43,00:55:46,And did he want to mass produce them a bit more because he did yeah
00:55:46,00:55:50,And then the official website says that he was into needle molding
00:55:50,00:55:55,And that he learned quilting skills from his mother and all that kind of stuff
00:55:55,00:55:59,"It seems very much. It does. You know, yeah"
00:55:59,00:56:03,So what we're saying is that the side of the box here where it says that the bunny bees
00:56:04,00:56:06,We're saying they're not involved at all
00:56:06,00:56:12,"No, I think one really weird thing about this this doll. I mean, there's a lot of weird things about this doll, but supposedly"
00:56:12,00:56:15,There's a guy called zavia
00:56:15,00:56:19,And he runs a hospital that looks after these
00:56:19,00:56:23,Cabbage babies until they're adopted. That's the guy we're talking about zavia
00:56:23,00:56:25,But if you look at any of these things
00:56:25,00:56:31,He's signed all the buttocks showing us the doll's butt. If you look at the bum of the doll
00:56:32,00:56:39,His signature is on the bum. Really? And I think that's kind of a weird thing for someone running a hospital to do to their babies
00:56:39,00:56:40,"Well, it's like those surgeons, isn't it?"
00:56:40,00:56:45,"So, you know, there's surgeons sometimes they get in trouble because there are a few surgeons who've got in trouble for burning"
00:56:45,00:56:49,"Their initials on a patient's liver, you know, mid-operation and then it turns out you've just, you know"
00:56:49,00:56:51,And it's kind of I guess it's a fun joke
00:56:51,00:56:54,But that's effectively what zavia appears to have done on all these ties
00:56:54,00:56:57,"Well, maybe sign them with pen and they went off and got it tattooed afterwards"
00:56:57,00:57:03,"Yeah, yeah, yeah, it could have been their own decision, you're right. In 2020 bringing in trolls, my favorites"
00:57:03,00:57:08,"There was one, uh, it was called the poppy and sing doll, I think"
00:57:08,00:57:13,And basically she had a little button on her tummy that you would press her and she'd be like
00:57:13,00:57:16,"""Ray, let's do a song"" or something"
00:57:16,00:57:21,"Um, but she also had a button underneath her so that when she sat down she would say other things"
00:57:22,00:57:28,"But that happened to be right, right in the crotch, like right, right in the gusset"
00:57:28,00:57:33,"Um, it was where that button was located and most of the sounds that she made when you pressed that"
00:57:33,00:57:36,were gasping
00:57:36,00:57:38,"Her going ""Oh"" and ""Weee!"""
00:57:38,00:57:41,"Yeah, like it's just sound effects"
00:57:41,00:57:46,"So there was a, um, there was a petition to recall it by a lot of furious parents who said that it would be grooming"
00:57:47,00:57:53,"Children, yeah, we've got room on this doll for two buttons. Okay, we've got the tummy one great belly button brilliant"
00:57:53,00:57:55,Can anyone think of where we should put the other button?
00:57:55,00:57:58,You know the hand
00:57:58,00:58:03,Play-doh had a their play-doh mountain cake
00:58:03,00:58:06,"Cake mountain, sorry the play set that came out"
00:58:06,00:58:10,"Recently for Christmas, but the extruder, you know, it looks like a syringe"
00:58:10,00:58:16,That you would put the play-doh in to do the icing on the cake is incredibly phallic like
00:58:17,00:58:19,If I like enough that it definitely wasn't a mistake
00:58:19,00:58:23,Children won't understand but you know
00:58:23,00:58:28,Is there like the equivalent of beat deafness where you're just
00:58:28,00:58:34,"Yeah, and sexual in your window blindness. Yeah to bias and arrest of development way"
00:58:34,00:58:37,Understand all those innuendos. Yeah
00:58:37,00:58:44,"I um, I hosted a make-away takeaway on citv, which obviously went so well. They decided to close the channel and"
00:58:45,00:58:47,Um
00:58:47,00:58:54,"But uh, that was an arts and craft show. It was really really fun. But the amount of times they had to stop filming because they go, uh"
00:58:54,00:58:58,It's looking a bit phallic like anything that you would make
00:58:58,00:59:05,Anything like event because anything you make there's something there's usually a moment where you have to make something that's sort of like sausage
00:59:05,00:59:08,That might be our problem
00:59:08,00:59:12,She's doing it again
