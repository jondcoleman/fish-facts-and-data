00:00:00,680 --> 00:00:07,200
 Hi everyone, welcome to this week's episode of No Such Things a Fish where we are joined by the incredible Beck Hill

2
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:10,000
 Now who is Beck Hill you ask?

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:14,220
 No, you don't because you're already a listener to a problem squared

4
00:00:14,220 --> 00:00:21,380
 Which is her amazing podcast that she does with mathematician and comedian Matt Parker where they spend her time solving

5
00:00:21,380 --> 00:00:23,800
 everybody's problems

6
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:28,820
 You probably also know Beck through her YouTube channel. She's got all sorts of stuff on there

7
00:00:28,820 --> 00:00:34,480
 I think notably you might know her for her flip-chat comedy where she miss his lyrics

8
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:39,400
 There's videos about her show make-away take away that she used to do on CITV

9
00:00:39,400 --> 00:00:44,060
 There's loads of stuff on there and of course if you're the right age or if you have children of the right age

10
00:00:44,060 --> 00:00:48,600
 You will know her from her books. She has a series of book called horror heights

11
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:50,800
 There are three in the series at the moment

12
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:56,360
 The latest is called Dead Ringer and they are of course available in all places where you buy your books

13
00:00:56,880 --> 00:01:00,260
 So that's all about Beck. There will be a little thing later on

14
00:01:00,260 --> 00:01:04,260
 Towards the end of the show where we might have an object

15
00:01:04,260 --> 00:01:09,180
 Which we will sign and give away to one of our listeners if you want to know more about that

16
00:01:09,180 --> 00:01:11,420
 You will have to sign up to club fish

17
00:01:11,420 --> 00:01:18,140
 We will give more details on how to win that during our next bonus drop as a line which will be out next Tuesday

18
00:01:18,140 --> 00:01:22,020
 Anyway, not much more to say. I mean we do have a live show coming up

19
00:01:22,020 --> 00:01:27,600
 Which I think the tickets might be all but sold out, but you can get streaming tickets from that

20
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:33,760
 You can go to no six things a fish dot com forward slash pod fest apart from that really this is the end

21
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:36,840
 It's time to say on with the podcast

22
00:01:36,840 --> 00:02:00,080
 Hello and welcome to another episode of no such thing as a fish a weekly podcast coming to you from the qi offices in

23
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:07,280
 Hoburn my name is Dan Shriver. I am sitting here with James Harkin Andrew Hunter Murray and Beck Hill and once again

24
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:13,280
 We have gathered around the microphones with our four favorite facts from the last seven days and in a particular order here

25
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:16,660
 We go starting with fact number one and that is

26
00:02:16,660 --> 00:02:19,000
 Beck in

27
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:26,100
 1927 a paint and was filed for an upper artist designed to scare criminals into confessing their crimes

28
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:30,660
 By creating an optical illusion of a ghost skeleton

29
00:02:30,660 --> 00:02:39,620
 How to do it it's pretty cool. Yeah, I mean it the paint was filed and I mean it was granted in 1930

30
00:02:39,620 --> 00:02:43,600
 Okay, it expired in 1947 so if anyone wants to make that now

31
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:48,300
 That make call of duty better. Wouldn't it whether trying to get

32
00:02:48,300 --> 00:02:51,840
 line of duty

33
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:58,400
 It is yeah, yeah, I just don't work out there as well. I think it would work everywhere pop a glowing skeleton

34
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:02,000
 Sorry, we'll get we'll get messages from the game as it won't work in call of duty

35
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,720
 Intensely realistic war experience

36
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:10,980
 Is more a kind of like can you storm Normandy than where were you on the night of the fourth?

37
00:03:10,980 --> 00:03:14,440
 More games need interrogation

38
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:17,040
 The Mario interrogation

39
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:22,400
 It's reading about

40
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:28,800
 Show jumping the other day, you know in the Olympics and in the first Olympic show jumping part of it was

41
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:30,880
 Just because we're talking about video games

42
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:36,280
 The horse had to walk along and people would roll barrels towards them and they'd have to jump over the barrels like in

43
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:41,760
 Isn't that cool? That's amazing. Yeah, imagine if that was your job

44
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:48,120
 Sorry, but this was off topic so quickly

45
00:03:48,920 --> 00:03:55,240
 Oh, yeah, so it was like it was a light. Do you know what I couldn't find out whether it was a real skeleton or a fake one

46
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:59,860
 But given the date I'm guessing was a real one

47
00:03:59,860 --> 00:04:07,480
 But it was a life-size skeleton with red glowing light bulbs in the eyes that would turn on and off to create the effect of blinking

48
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:11,240
 and it was lit from the top and the bottom and

49
00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:13,600
 basically the

50
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:15,080
 the suspected

51
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:17,080
 criminal would be put into a

52
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:21,280
 chamber like a room that's completely darkened and then

53
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:25,200
 the interrogator would sit behind this skeleton and

54
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:31,240
 Talk through a megaphone that would sort of come out of the skeletons mouth and the skeleton be

55
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:35,280
 Lit a little bit to create the effect of a ghostly outline

56
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:42,120
 Blowing eyes. Yeah. Yeah, and it's and the effect the idea was the criminal would go into a darkened room to begin with

57
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:44,320
 So this was going on with the police officers

58
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:51,000
 What's happening and then suddenly this curtain would raise and this furious glowing skeleton would be there saying you did it

59
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:59,160
 Didn't you or whatever it would work so well the first time on I presume everyone who was who'd committed a crime and was trying

60
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:04,400
 To cover it up isn't it's a very striking experience to have if you're the one being you know questioned by a skeleton

61
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:06,820
 But I guess the criminal fraternity would would be more

62
00:05:06,820 --> 00:05:11,360
 Yeah, we'll be blasÃ© about it after a few years of the skeleton being there. I would know about it

63
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:15,160
 Wouldn't they yeah, they'd have to keep tracking it out and you know, different

64
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:21,600
 There's a detail in this which kind of confused me because this is the 1930s

65
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:26,480
 Which said that as well as having the the megaphone and the glowing eyes it also had a camera in the head

66
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:33,080
 Yes film would you get sound recording as well to record sound as well and it actually included a way of

67
00:05:33,080 --> 00:05:40,200
 Recording the sound and the visuals at the same time onto this film. Yeah, that is very early

68
00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:45,600
 And we had cinema and stuff like that, so I think this it was a woman who did it wasn't it?

69
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:48,160
 Helen Adelaide Shelby. Yeah

70
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:52,960
 I think she basically took a load of things that have been invented around that time and said oh, we could do this with this

71
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:56,400
 Oh, we could do this with this. Oh flashing lights. Let's do that for the eyes. Yeah

72
00:05:56,400 --> 00:06:01,360
 One thing I couldn't find out was her decision to turn it into an interrogation thing

73
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:06,380
 Like that's quite a cool effect if you were like, oh, well, we could create this effect and put it on stage

74
00:06:06,840 --> 00:06:11,660
 What like did she just read a Christmas carol and was like, oh, I know what gets people guilty

75
00:06:11,660 --> 00:06:17,480
 But that's the thing she's she doesn't come from that background. So it's Helena. Sorry not or Helena

76
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:24,000
 Rather than Helen and she she was a real estate mogul. She was like she's the bed on horses

77
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:30,040
 There's nothing else in the literature about her that suggests that this came from any background in policing or anything like that

78
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:32,040
 And she kind of disappears as well. You don't really

79
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:36,440
 I found that she did die in

80
00:06:36,440 --> 00:06:40,480
 1947 right I found in the newspapers when it expired

81
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:46,320
 And I found that her father-in-law Samuel was a famous Civil War veteran

82
00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:53,680
 His first foray in the Civil War was down the Mississippi River and the entire platoon was hospitalized because they all drank swamp water

83
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:58,880
 That's all I found out. She had a husband called Edgar. Let's see how the other detail

84
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:10,920
 Yeah, it's all she's remembered for now is is mostly this doesn't think I I found out that Tom Scott the

85
00:07:10,920 --> 00:07:13,600
 YouTuber had

86
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:22,440
 recreated this oh this invention in 2020. So they recreated the actual skeleton and everything and did an experiment with three other people

87
00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:25,080
 where he left them alone with a cookie and

88
00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:30,080
 One of them had to steal the cookie and then he interrogated them and they didn't know what he was doing

89
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:32,800
 So he was just like I'm trying out a new technique

90
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:35,240
 and then he puts them in this room and

91
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:38,160
 the first to

92
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:44,320
 I've scared at first because they're in a dark room and they have no idea what to expect and then when the skin was it appears

93
00:07:44,320 --> 00:07:46,320
 They just crack up laughing

94
00:07:46,320 --> 00:07:52,920
 You would though wouldn't you I mean I can imagine it being spooky at first, but I'd be far more scared of a dark room

95
00:07:52,920 --> 00:07:59,320
 Yeah, so you know the one-way mirror thing. Yeah, there's not actually there's no such thing as a one-way mirror

96
00:07:59,320 --> 00:08:01,320
 No, there is it's actually a window

97
00:08:01,320 --> 00:08:04,680
 So that's the dullest fact I found at the course of research

98
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:09,880
 It's all about yeah lighting. Yeah, it's a window covered with highly reflective coating

99
00:08:09,880 --> 00:08:14,320
 It's not a mirror. What makes the difference between them. Is it just because a mirror has like a

100
00:08:14,320 --> 00:08:18,960
 Steel background. I think the mirror has the that yeah, it's like a properly opaque background

101
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:23,240
 Whereas with the one-way window as all the kids will be calling it

102
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:28,720
 Oh

103
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:34,420
 Because the lights are always off only in the room where the the senior cops are watching the questioning happen

104
00:08:34,420 --> 00:08:36,120
 But the lights are always dark in that way

105
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:41,880
 Yeah, if you turned on the lights in that room you'd see them the thing is that is you want people to think it's a mirror, right?

106
00:08:41,880 --> 00:08:45,000
 That's the whole point. Yeah, if you say we've got our window here

107
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:50,760
 Then they're gonna go. Oh, I thought that was a mirror like you have to call it a mirror in order to keep up

108
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:53,360
 But everyone knows there are people behind there now. Do they yeah

109
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:56,760
 No, the question is you don't know whether there's someone behind there or not

110
00:08:56,760 --> 00:09:01,680
 I can't believe they exist actually to the eggs. I've never been arrested. Have you been interrogated?

111
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:04,940
 What did you do? I used to work in market research my first job and

112
00:09:04,940 --> 00:09:10,840
 Wait, there was a market research house, which was in Slough, and I was conducting the surveys

113
00:09:10,840 --> 00:09:14,240
 How interesting the focus group stuff. Yeah, it was all one-on-one stuff

114
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:18,800
 It was with women between the age of 18 and 39 who had acid reflux and

115
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:23,460
 They had to speak to me for an hour and a half each and I had to ask them all the questions about their

116
00:09:23,460 --> 00:09:26,120
 Yeah, and do you watch them through a one-way mirror?

117
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:31,200
 There were there were there were people from I'm not gonna say which pharmaceutical giant for watching them through the window

118
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:35,920
 The mirror whatever and they were in the they were in the next room and after the interview ended

119
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:38,920
 I'd pop next door and I'd say was there anything else you wanted me to ask and they'd say yeah

120
00:09:38,920 --> 00:09:45,080
 Can you just ask question 17 again? Okay, so this this woman middle-aged woman with acid reflux. Yeah, I'm talking to you

121
00:09:45,080 --> 00:09:50,400
 I'm here. There's a big window there. Yeah, I mean mirror. Yeah, does she is she thinking all the time?

122
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:54,040
 There's someone behind that or was the illusion kept the whole time

123
00:09:54,040 --> 00:09:59,440
 Because I reckon they wouldn't have no otherwise. What's the point? I think I saw I thought might have to say there might be people

124
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:04,160
 Oh, did you observing but don't you know don't worry about it. Just talk to me looking to my eyes

125
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:09,400
 Yeah, were you good interviewer or bad interviewer like you get good cop and bad

126
00:10:12,920 --> 00:10:18,880
 No, honestly acid reflux is totally normal don't worry about it. You can tell me about it. You're a sick puppy and you're gonna burn

127
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:22,280
 Yeah

128
00:10:22,280 --> 00:10:27,700
 I was not a very good interview right and the weird thing was it was just two of us working on the case me and my boss and

129
00:10:27,700 --> 00:10:31,420
 After the fourth day of questioning sessions

130
00:10:31,420 --> 00:10:36,280
 We came down to breakfast at the sort of like premier room. We was doing whatever and we both had acid reflux

131
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:42,200
 No, and then it turns out there was another

132
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:54,440
 I once once in a focus group with with the with the windows thing

133
00:10:54,440 --> 00:10:57,360
 But we knew that they were people because you just know like oh well

134
00:10:57,360 --> 00:10:59,240
 Someone's got to watch it's just so you don't get distracted

135
00:10:59,240 --> 00:11:04,440
 But we had to play video games and give feedback on on the video games. I think it was little big planet

136
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:06,600
 Yeah, and I said there should be more interrogation

137
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:12,480
 I was wondering

138
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:19,240
 What happens if you confess but the police of you confess to as a Catholic because obviously they can't pass on what

139
00:11:19,240 --> 00:11:21,360
 Confessions that but it doesn't really

140
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:29,040
 Like it's a priest cop that's the pitch of the TV series. He's a priest by day

141
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:34,440
 He's a cop by night, you know, but the priest is not allowed to tell anyone what's in confessed, right, right?

142
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:38,800
 Because although when I was at school and I used to go to confession. We had good priests bad priests

143
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:46,580
 The bad priests used to rat on you all the time man. Yeah, also, there's that one-way mirror in the confession

144
00:11:46,580 --> 00:11:51,280
 Spooky images in Catholic churches, they do you know

145
00:11:51,280 --> 00:12:00,320
 Growing red eyes, but this is the way that so I think in I think they're all

146
00:12:00,640 --> 00:12:06,040
 So in confession booths the rule is that the priest can't disclose anything to anyone. That's how I understand

147
00:12:06,040 --> 00:12:07,600
 Yeah, but there is some leeway

148
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:12,400
 I think if there's so like if Dan I'm the priest, right Dan comes into the booth and he says

149
00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:15,720
 I'm going to kill James in fact number two

150
00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:20,560
 So if notice it sings a fish, right? I think I am allowed as the priest

151
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:25,960
 I think some schools of thought say I am allowed to go to the police and say you might want to check on James check

152
00:12:25,960 --> 00:12:30,880
 He's all right. Yeah, you might be a threat to him at some point, but I'm not allowed to say Dan is going to kill him

153
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:35,080
 Yeah, yeah, same with psychiatry, right when you admit

154
00:12:35,080 --> 00:12:38,160
 You know planning to murder James

155
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:42,400
 It took me a long time to get that out in the sessions

156
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:47,640
 Just kill him

157
00:12:47,640 --> 00:12:50,040
 What are you waiting for?

158
00:12:50,040 --> 00:12:52,080
 But they're allowed to pass on active threats, aren't they?

159
00:12:52,080 --> 00:12:58,040
 It must be able to. There must be vanishingly few cases of people in confession booths or therapy sessions saying like this is the time

160
00:12:58,040 --> 00:13:00,040
 Place I'm going to commit the moida

161
00:13:00,040 --> 00:13:04,520
 I don't think it happens much. I like that you tried to make it a lighter thing by

162
00:13:04,520 --> 00:13:09,560
 This has gone a bit dark. Let's say moida

163
00:13:09,560 --> 00:13:20,920
 Music is often used in interrogation tactics. That's a big thing metal music particularly we've heard about that

164
00:13:20,920 --> 00:13:27,880
 Oh, and like one time. Oh, yeah, and John Ronson wrote about the fact that like Barney music would be played the Barney the purple dinosaur

165
00:13:27,880 --> 00:13:34,600
 I love you you love that song over and over to to make people go insane ever play the blobby Christmas number one

166
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:38,040
 I bet they have I bet they have it's seen as torture

167
00:13:38,040 --> 00:13:45,120
 But um one band that gets used a lot as Metallica and Metallica hate it because you know as any musician would have this opinion

168
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:50,720
 It's that music and politics music and in you know interrogation and questionable torture

169
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:56,200
 Shouldn't be mixed. I wouldn't say all musicians think that but well, yeah, I imagine most of them

170
00:13:56,200 --> 00:14:01,840
 I think there is a band in the States a Christian rock band that were like you can use our music demon hunters

171
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:05,720
 I think the demon hunter. It's not cool. It's not quite yeah

172
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:11,680
 So Metallica asked for their music not to be used which it wasn't there was an interview with the guy who has claimed that he killed

173
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:12,600
 Summer bin Laden

174
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:19,840
 I don't know if that ever was confirmed the seal six team and he said that Metallica reached out to them and said can you not use our music and

175
00:14:19,840 --> 00:14:26,200
 Demon hunter he claimed then got piped up and said you can have our music. It's fine. And here's some patches demon hunter came out and said

176
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:31,140
 Actually, that's not the case. We didn't know what it was being used for. They just said they like playing our music

177
00:14:31,140 --> 00:14:33,640
 They made their own patches. So supposedly a demon

178
00:14:33,640 --> 00:14:41,920
 They only yeah, military would like to wear lots of different patches like the scouts

179
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:48,200
 You're killing oh summer bin Laden bud

180
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:50,600
 Oh

181
00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:58,080
 One of the most feared

182
00:14:58,080 --> 00:15:04,040
 Nazi interrogators was a guy called Hans Schaaf in the second one bore and he was not he wasn't a soldier

183
00:15:04,040 --> 00:15:07,640
 He was a Polish born. Thank you as a farmer. He lived in South Africa

184
00:15:07,640 --> 00:15:10,760
 but he was fluent in English and if you were an

185
00:15:10,760 --> 00:15:13,920
 Pilot or air crew and you were caught

186
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:17,440
 You would go to this little town near Frankfurt and you'll be put up in

187
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:23,840
 Reasonably nice digs and they just talked to you for a couple of weeks and Hans Schaaf was the one leading these efforts

188
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:29,280
 And they would present you with this incredible dossier. They'd say here are all your unit members names. Here's your home base

189
00:15:29,280 --> 00:15:30,880
 Here's the commander's dog's name

190
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:37,280
 Here's the pub that you guys all drink in when and they just they would present you tiny fragments of information that made you think

191
00:15:37,280 --> 00:15:39,400
 They knew absolutely everything

192
00:15:39,760 --> 00:15:44,760
 You were likely to talk and give away secrets of you know wish what the weaknesses of your planes or whatever it might be

193
00:15:44,760 --> 00:15:50,040
 But the son the incredibly weird things that Hans Schaaf after the Second World War. He went to work at Disneyland

194
00:15:50,040 --> 00:15:58,180
 He became a mosaic artist and he did Cinderella's castle at Disney or Disney World. I think in Florida

195
00:15:58,180 --> 00:16:02,220
 Yeah, that is do you know what though if I worked in

196
00:16:02,220 --> 00:16:07,800
 Nazi interrogation that I want to go off and then work in a magical wonderland

197
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:15,680
 Art like you've heard that. Yeah, that's amazing. Yeah, I just imagine the interview where they want to find a mosaic maker

198
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:17,840
 They're like, well, what did you do in your previous job?

199
00:16:17,840 --> 00:16:35,680
 Okay, it is time for fact number two and that is my fact my fact this week is that in real life

200
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:41,820
 The author of Charlotte's web became the foster parent to the spider children. He based Charlotte on

201
00:16:41,820 --> 00:16:49,740
 So spider dad spider dad. Yeah, by spider children mean the children of a spider or not

202
00:16:49,740 --> 00:16:59,800
 So Eby white author of Charlotte's web who also penned the classic Stuart Little and quite a few

203
00:17:00,120 --> 00:17:06,640
 Bigger adult books as well the elements of style and is sex necessary which he wrote with James Thurver

204
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:08,340
 These were huge books back in the day

205
00:17:08,340 --> 00:17:14,040
 He loved animals and Charlotte of Charlotte's web is based on a real spider that he'd seen

206
00:17:14,040 --> 00:17:19,760
 He'd spotted it one autumn in 1949 and he came back later and the spider was gone and

207
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:25,160
 The sack of the eggs were still sitting in the web and he thought okay

208
00:17:25,160 --> 00:17:29,000
 I'm gonna collect that so he took it down and he put it into a box and he goes to New York

209
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:35,840
 And he travels with this and he has it in his office and the eggs survived and and they came out these spiders and started

210
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:42,500
 Crawling over his office and they even had their web shoot up and they saw them flying across the office and he thought this is great

211
00:17:42,500 --> 00:17:44,800
 I'm just gonna let them do what they do and so for weeks

212
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:49,560
 They just made home on his desk in his office. It's his flat. I think it was yeah, yeah

213
00:17:49,560 --> 00:17:53,760
 Sorry, New York and and it wasn't until his cleaner came along who just went. I'm sorry

214
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:57,200
 I can't clean everything but the spiders that are infesting this room

215
00:17:57,720 --> 00:18:01,280
 That actually then they were murdered. What did she not walk around?

216
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:04,600
 I don't know. I guess my cleaner doesn't kill my cat every time she comes around

217
00:18:04,600 --> 00:18:09,280
 She could work around the spider. You don't have hundreds of cats the size of a tiny eyelash

218
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:14,180
 I don't know. It feels like she could work around the spiders. Yeah, you'd think so, but she she complained

219
00:18:14,180 --> 00:18:19,440
 He said fine. You can you can kill them and don't have a cleaner. Jeez. I don't have a cleaner

220
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:22,280
 That's how you not get your spider children buried

221
00:18:23,800 --> 00:18:29,700
 Yeah, yeah, so yeah, but it's quite nice to know that we never knew the fate of Charlotte the spider itself

222
00:18:29,700 --> 00:18:32,440
 I believe I would have died exactly the species

223
00:18:32,440 --> 00:18:39,480
 Yeah, we only live for a year don't they it's but if it's bound spider. Yeah, it's quite a good bond spider

224
00:18:39,480 --> 00:18:43,800
 That's what that was. I think was it? It's got a scientific name. I didn't see

225
00:18:43,800 --> 00:18:47,880
 Oh, yeah, but I didn't even know there was a common name of a barn spider. I've heard of the house by the though

226
00:18:47,880 --> 00:18:55,120
 So the spiders called Charlotte covac covatica. Yeah, and it's covatica. Maybe the scientific name it is

227
00:18:55,120 --> 00:18:59,440
 So Charlotte a covatica and the a is a shortened scientific word

228
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:04,580
 So Rainer's I think right Aranis I might be pronouncing that wrong Uranus

229
00:19:04,580 --> 00:19:09,600
 Sorry just to put you a cap of the charlotte's web

230
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:15,600
 So there's a pig and a spider. Yeah, and the spider saves the pigs life by spinning words into the web

231
00:19:15,720 --> 00:19:21,040
 Yeah, someone's gonna kill the pig the farm is gonna kill the pig farm is gonna kill big pig right at the beginning of the book

232
00:19:21,040 --> 00:19:25,680
 I think and then yeah, and Charlotte and the pig have an unlikely friendship

233
00:19:25,680 --> 00:19:30,480
 Hmm, it is weird that as a farmer you would see the words written in the web and think this pig is incredible

234
00:19:39,960 --> 00:19:44,720
 So is I actually didn't write down his full first two names eb

235
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:49,960
 Elwin Brooks elwin Brooks. Thank you. Yeah. Yeah, so eb is elwin Brooks

236
00:19:49,960 --> 00:19:53,280
 But actually went by the name Andy his whole life

237
00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:58,020
 Yeah, and it's a really odd reason he went to Cornell University

238
00:19:58,020 --> 00:20:00,020
 And there's a tradition at Cornell

239
00:20:00,020 --> 00:20:06,400
 Which is if you happen to have shared the surname of the person who was the co-founder and the first president of Cornell

240
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:11,000
 Who was a guy called Andrew Dixon white then you had to just be called Andy?

241
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:18,820
 Because he was called Andy. So they showed the so they bite and and so he got given that at Cornell and then the rest of his life

242
00:20:18,820 --> 00:20:21,900
 That's what it's what his wife called him. It's what his friends. It's what his colleagues

243
00:20:21,900 --> 00:20:26,100
 I'm just that still happens at Cornell if you had surname white that you get nicknamed Andy

244
00:20:26,100 --> 00:20:30,720
 You know, it was a real pig as well as a real spider

245
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:35,560
 Yeah, so he it's a lot of it's really drawn from life because he he lived in

246
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:44,480
 Maine on a lovely farm and he just as Dan said he connected with nature a lot and he almost preferred his farm to we definitely preferred his farm to city life

247
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:49,740
 but he kept a pig and in 1948 so

248
00:20:49,740 --> 00:20:52,960
 three or four years before writing Charlotte's web

249
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:56,360
 He wrote the essay death of a pig which is all about a pig

250
00:20:56,360 --> 00:20:59,260
 he'd been planning to slaughter which then got very ill and

251
00:20:59,260 --> 00:21:02,400
 The pig had erycepolis, which is a

252
00:21:03,800 --> 00:21:04,960
 condition

253
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:09,960
 Erycepolis. Yeah, erycepolis. It's a skin condition Dan Finsley couldn't pronounce a few years ago on this podcast

254
00:21:09,960 --> 00:21:14,280
 Yeah, and it's dangerous because it can transfer to people as well

255
00:21:14,280 --> 00:21:16,280
 It's a friend of the podcast

256
00:21:16,280 --> 00:21:24,280
 And he wrote I discovered that once one has given a pig and enema there is no turning back

257
00:21:24,280 --> 00:21:27,720
 The pigs lot and mine were inextricably bound now. Oh

258
00:21:27,720 --> 00:21:32,920
 So you had to give the pig a medical enema at one point or another and it really brought them closer together

259
00:21:33,880 --> 00:21:38,840
 Sure, I love everything I've read about EBY. I love he just seems such a dork

260
00:21:38,840 --> 00:21:43,320
 He would have been perfect. I think on this podcast like here's a here's an example of how dorky he was

261
00:21:43,320 --> 00:21:51,400
 So he fell in love with this girl called Catherine sergeant angle who was a fiction editor who worked at the New Yorker

262
00:21:51,400 --> 00:21:58,920
 And that's he was a writer for the New Yorker. She was married at the time. Yeah, that's right. Yeah, and they they eloped and

263
00:21:59,960 --> 00:22:07,080
 They had uh, you know, they had their marriage and then he said later on I soon realized I'd made no mistake in my choice of wife

264
00:22:07,080 --> 00:22:12,280
 I was helping her pack an overnight bag one afternoon when she said put in some tooth twine

265
00:22:12,280 --> 00:22:17,400
 I knew then that a girl who called dental floss tooth twine was the girl for me

266
00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:20,360
 Oh, that's so sweet

267
00:22:20,360 --> 00:22:28,120
 Well, I uh, I quite enjoyed finding out that when someone asked him why he wrote charlotte's web

268
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:33,160
 He said, uh, I haven't told why I wrote the book, but I haven't told you why I sneeze either

269
00:22:33,160 --> 00:22:35,720
 and a book is a sneeze

270
00:22:35,720 --> 00:22:42,120
 That is his uh, yeah, he doesn't know why inside you and you just have to you have a story inside you and you have to

271
00:22:42,120 --> 00:22:45,880
 Share it with the world. Yeah, I guess it leaves your body at 17 miles an hour. Yeah

272
00:22:45,880 --> 00:22:49,720
 And if you keep your eyes open when you're right in the book, they will pop out

273
00:22:49,720 --> 00:22:56,760
 Did you see that letter that a little girl wrote to him asking him why it was nine years after charlotte's web had come out

274
00:22:56,760 --> 00:23:01,640
 And she said when's the next book coming out and he replied I would like to write another book for children

275
00:23:01,640 --> 00:23:07,320
 But I spend all my spare time just answering letters. I get from children about the books. I have already written

276
00:23:07,320 --> 00:23:16,280
 So it looks like a hopeless situation unless you can start a movement in america called don't write to eb white until he produces another book

277
00:23:16,280 --> 00:23:19,880
 That's harsh that isn't it? Yeah

278
00:23:19,880 --> 00:23:24,920
 But that is like the that is exactly the sort of reply that I end up start doing on twitter

279
00:23:26,360 --> 00:23:30,040
 Like with the reply guys and stuff. I'm like, oh, I'm just running out of patience now

280
00:23:30,040 --> 00:23:35,240
 Do you reply to reply guys? I used to really don't don't bother now. No, no, no

281
00:23:35,240 --> 00:23:41,720
 No, I've never heard that term. Is that just people who reply no matter what? Well, no, it's it's it's quite a sex-specific thing, isn't it?

282
00:23:41,720 --> 00:23:48,280
 Yeah, well, general generally reply guys tend to be due to reply to women to and in my case

283
00:23:48,280 --> 00:23:52,440
 Explain our own jokes to us or why they might be better somehow

284
00:23:52,440 --> 00:23:54,680
 in addition to something

285
00:23:54,680 --> 00:23:56,680
 often incorrect

286
00:23:56,680 --> 00:24:00,600
 Have you thought of trying harder?

287
00:24:00,600 --> 00:24:06,440
 He had a really interesting process for writing eb white

288
00:24:06,440 --> 00:24:10,920
 So he could never listen to music because that would be it would get his attention

289
00:24:10,920 --> 00:24:16,200
 Diverted and that and that's I think quite famous for any writer anything with lyrics get that away

290
00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:20,840
 But what he did used to do was sit in the bit of his house that had the most traffic in it

291
00:24:20,920 --> 00:24:27,080
 So his wife passing through his kids passing through whoever was in the house. Yeah, not like cars and stuff. No, exactly

292
00:24:27,080 --> 00:24:29,240
 But like just yeah foot traffic

293
00:24:29,240 --> 00:24:34,840
 From his family. I think that's crazy. I agree. I think that's really difficult to concentrate when there's so much happening

294
00:24:34,840 --> 00:24:38,040
 Yeah, it's that must be one of the most unusual writing methods

295
00:24:38,040 --> 00:24:40,600
 Anyone's any writers ever heard. Yeah

296
00:24:40,600 --> 00:24:46,120
 Like Dan Brown hangs upside down or something to write that sounds like a dr. Zeus book

297
00:24:46,120 --> 00:24:48,760
 Dan Brown

298
00:24:49,080 --> 00:24:55,240
 Yeah, he would do that if he had if he just needed thinking time he would hang upside down

299
00:24:55,240 --> 00:24:57,320
 I don't think he physically

300
00:24:57,320 --> 00:25:03,240
 Because the pen just wouldn't work after exactly we might have a space pen. Oh, yeah. Yeah on this anti-gravity or a pencil

301
00:25:03,240 --> 00:25:07,960
 You know, uh, stew at little. Yeah, man. Oh, yeah. What is it? What is it though? Best friend a mouse, right?

302
00:25:07,960 --> 00:25:14,120
 And was they right? I mean wrong. Oh, he's not a mouse. He's not even a mouse. Is he a doormouse?

303
00:25:14,520 --> 00:25:21,480
 No, no, he's so he's he's a child. He looks small. He looks like a mouse. What? Oh, right?

304
00:25:21,480 --> 00:25:23,560
 Really? It's very weird. No in the book

305
00:25:23,560 --> 00:25:28,680
 Yeah, in the book it's described as because he's he's given birth to by his human parents

306
00:25:28,680 --> 00:25:31,640
 And they say and the book says he's the size of a mouse

307
00:25:31,640 --> 00:25:35,960
 And he he has all the characteristics of a mouse, but he is

308
00:25:35,960 --> 00:25:42,200
 He's quite indeterminate as species. So in the book it's not illustrated as it or is it?

309
00:25:42,360 --> 00:25:49,480
 I don't know if the original edition was illustrated because in charlotte's web the illustrator wanted to give the spider

310
00:25:49,480 --> 00:25:55,320
 human woman facial features terrifying. Yeah, and uh, and they were like, no

311
00:25:55,320 --> 00:25:59,560
 She just looked like a spider and so that was just a spider, but in the animated film

312
00:25:59,560 --> 00:26:05,080
 She was given a face given. She's got a lady face. Maybe that's why because he hated the movie didn't he?

313
00:26:05,080 --> 00:26:10,920
 Yeah, he saw it and I guess like a lot of children's authors like pl travers seeing mary poppins the movie

314
00:26:11,480 --> 00:26:17,080
 Hated the way that their work is translated. Um, he hated charlotte's web. Um, that might be the reason

315
00:26:17,080 --> 00:26:20,440
 But this kind of makes sense that maybe stewart little wasn't

316
00:26:20,440 --> 00:26:23,640
 A mouse because he did have a bit of a bugbear about

317
00:26:23,640 --> 00:26:28,200
 When people made animals a bit more human-like rather than like charlotte's web

318
00:26:28,200 --> 00:26:30,360
 It was a pig and it was a spider

319
00:26:30,360 --> 00:26:35,480
 Whereas he can never understand mickey mouse and donald duck and say why are they driving a car the hell's going on there?

320
00:26:35,480 --> 00:26:41,400
 You feel like the mouse a mouse doesn't drive a car because I haven't read this book because his spider quite realistic

321
00:26:41,640 --> 00:26:43,880
 like band spider female band spiders will

322
00:26:43,880 --> 00:26:50,280
 Stick some like silk out of their bum and then walk around and that's got like pheromones on it

323
00:26:50,280 --> 00:26:52,920
 And then the males will follow her around. Oh, there's a whole chapter about this

324
00:26:52,920 --> 00:26:58,520
 It's where the spider babies come from brilliant. Yeah, but he did use a lot of technical terms

325
00:26:58,520 --> 00:27:05,080
 He explained like the different bits of like that. He was very he researched spiders for ages to get all of the understanding

326
00:27:05,080 --> 00:27:10,040
 So when you read it you get an understanding about like, you know, this bit of the leg is called this this bit of the hand

327
00:27:10,360 --> 00:27:12,360
 The end

328
00:27:12,360 --> 00:27:20,840
 He um, he was incredibly shy as well. He'd be white. He was very he's very anxious guy about not pretty much everything

329
00:27:20,840 --> 00:27:25,480
 Um, when he when he worked at the new yorker, he would sometimes go out of the fire escape if someone

330
00:27:25,480 --> 00:27:30,840
 He didn't know turned up at the office. Oh, he'd just pop out, you know of the window effectively

331
00:27:30,840 --> 00:27:36,360
 Wow, um, he skipped. Well anytime it was someone he didn't know at the office or someone who's coming to talk to him

332
00:27:36,360 --> 00:27:40,280
 I think probably someone coming to take office, isn't it? He wouldn't have done everything done. Yeah, you're right

333
00:27:40,520 --> 00:27:43,240
 Um, please give me it just sounds like someone who's smoking and try

334
00:27:43,240 --> 00:27:47,400
 Yeah, he skipped parties

335
00:27:47,400 --> 00:27:51,160
 He skipped his the burial service of his wife of many decades

336
00:27:51,160 --> 00:27:56,040
 He skipped the presidential medal of freedom awards ceremony where jfk was trying to give him a medal

337
00:27:56,040 --> 00:28:00,840
 The national medal for literature award. He skipped that too. He just did not want to go out

338
00:28:00,840 --> 00:28:06,680
 He was shy around women, wasn't he? Was he? Um, yeah, he once said I have too small a heart and too large a pen

339
00:28:07,480 --> 00:28:10,280
 And it feels like he forgets we have the bad sense of it

340
00:28:10,280 --> 00:28:19,320
 Yeah, he his wife even when he was communicating sort of love notes and stuff

341
00:28:19,320 --> 00:28:24,440
 He would still even hide behind an animal persona. I don't think he was a furry. I think he just didn't

342
00:28:24,440 --> 00:28:27,080
 Yeah, I don't think anyone thinks

343
00:28:27,080 --> 00:28:30,040
 But you thought that

344
00:28:30,040 --> 00:28:34,360
 Actually, he wasn't a fairy. He was a human with the characteristics of a fairy

345
00:28:36,040 --> 00:28:38,120
 Yeah, um, this is all by the way

346
00:28:38,120 --> 00:28:41,640
 It's a guy called michael simms who wrote this amazing biography on him

347
00:28:41,640 --> 00:28:47,880
 Who discovered that charlotte was based on a real spider found out this story about the the eggsack and he did an interview on npr

348
00:28:47,880 --> 00:28:52,680
 Where I was reading this on and um, he said that when it came to the audiobook the death scene

349
00:28:52,680 --> 00:28:55,400
 So spoiler alert charlotte dies in the book

350
00:28:55,400 --> 00:28:59,160
 Um, he found it impossible to read the death scene

351
00:28:59,160 --> 00:29:05,480
 Out loud and according to the producer it took him 17 takes in order to get it out finally

352
00:29:06,040 --> 00:29:08,040
 Uh, he said they would how many takes did your book take that?

353
00:29:08,040 --> 00:29:12,920
 I was just crying the whole way through you shouldn't have put the word erycee plus in

354
00:29:12,920 --> 00:29:19,880
 But he would go out he would go out for walks would try and get himself together to go back in and do it

355
00:29:19,880 --> 00:29:20,920
 And he would say yeah

356
00:29:20,920 --> 00:29:26,600
 He's like this is ridiculous a grown man crying over the death of an imaginary insect go back in and then just start crying all over

357
00:29:26,600 --> 00:29:28,600
 Not an insect, mate. Yeah

358
00:29:32,040 --> 00:29:40,120
 James is in the booth pressing of us and uh, maybe that's who's crying, you know the final light is and then the insect died

359
00:29:40,120 --> 00:29:53,960
 It is time for fact number three and that is andy my fact is that one of the world's best dance choreographers is called

360
00:29:53,960 --> 00:29:56,200
 Mr. Millipede

361
00:29:56,200 --> 00:30:00,120
 Um, I should say this was sent in by a listener

362
00:30:00,120 --> 00:30:05,000
 So thank you to Maggie Mortensen who sent it in. Um, yeah, and uh, mr. Millipede. I think he's Benjamin

363
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:11,800
 Yes, and no now james is looking. It's giving me a look millipede. Is it millipede?

364
00:30:11,800 --> 00:30:15,480
 It's how he would pronounce it. It's how he would pronounce it, but it's not how I'm pronouncing it

365
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:22,760
 He's not on this podcast. So no, but it's it's millipede. Yeah, it translates into french as a thousand feet, right? Yeah, there we go

366
00:30:22,760 --> 00:30:27,640
 Um, I've seen newspaper articles interviewing him who call him the man with a thousand feet

367
00:30:28,920 --> 00:30:33,560
 Really? Yeah, that's great. I think because he dances so well. It's almost as if he has a thousand feet

368
00:30:33,560 --> 00:30:36,120
 Maybe yeah, I get a lot harder to dance

369
00:30:36,120 --> 00:30:40,520
 It would be yeah if two left feet, but you've got like what 500

370
00:30:40,520 --> 00:30:48,600
 And this is just a fact about someone with an amusing name in the world of dance. Hmm. Yeah, no one is to have determinism

371
00:30:48,600 --> 00:30:52,840
 Yeah, yeah, I went to school with a girl called erin trimmer who became a hairdresser

372
00:30:52,840 --> 00:30:55,000
 Nice

373
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:56,600
 Brilliant

374
00:30:56,600 --> 00:30:58,600
 Shout out to erin trimmer

375
00:30:58,920 --> 00:31:04,840
 So mr. Millipede, uh, is he's quite notable in the world of hollywood. He has choreographed a lot of movies

376
00:31:04,840 --> 00:31:10,280
 He's done june the first june movie. He did the choreograph for the um for the giant worm dance. giant millipede

377
00:31:10,280 --> 00:31:12,360
 Yeah, the big millipede that comes out

378
00:31:12,360 --> 00:31:16,760
 There's a dance in there. I believe I haven't seen the movie myself. Yes. There's there's a dance

379
00:31:16,760 --> 00:31:19,560
 There's a cool shifting dance over the sand

380
00:31:19,560 --> 00:31:23,720
 We sashay to avoid attracting the attention of the big old worms that live in the desert

381
00:31:23,800 --> 00:31:29,080
 Because they feel the vibrations of your feet they sense movement for them and they're incredibly sensitive to it

382
00:31:29,080 --> 00:31:33,880
 But if you walk in a particular way then well, they won't spot you. Is it a dance or is it just someone walking?

383
00:31:33,880 --> 00:31:36,040
 Well, it's a gate, you know a gate

384
00:31:36,040 --> 00:31:41,080
 I'm not seeing june, but I imagined that it was like a bit in the movie where they're like

385
00:31:41,080 --> 00:31:43,720
 And now we do the word

386
00:31:43,720 --> 00:31:50,040
 Everybody joins in and they're like it's just a step to the left. Yeah, basically it's I'm imagining

387
00:31:50,040 --> 00:31:52,760
 Yeah, mr. Millipede comes running out in leotard

388
00:31:52,840 --> 00:31:56,760
 It's like a Jane Fonda video. Yeah. Um, but he also did black swan

389
00:31:56,760 --> 00:32:01,320
 Which was the ballet movie and it was on that movie that he met his future wife

390
00:32:01,320 --> 00:32:06,120
 Natalie Portman. So yeah, mr. Millipede is married to Natalie Portman

391
00:32:06,120 --> 00:32:08,840
 Just some hot goss

392
00:32:08,840 --> 00:32:16,040
 Great yeah, yeah, they split up though because he's got together with one of the worms from dune

393
00:32:19,560 --> 00:32:27,560
 Yeah, um, but no just uh ballet unless anyone's got anything more on on benny mill. Um, mr. Millipede has got a tattoo on his abdomen

394
00:32:27,560 --> 00:32:34,760
 Of a bow house symbol, which I think is quite cool. You know the german architecture thing

395
00:32:34,760 --> 00:32:40,680
 It's a it's like a profile of a face uh designed by a painter called oska schlemmer

396
00:32:40,680 --> 00:32:49,480
 And oska schlemmer is really cool. He was he had five of his artworks in the nazi organized degenerative art exhibition

397
00:32:49,720 --> 00:32:53,080
 In munich. Do you know about that? So they piled up a load of art

398
00:32:53,080 --> 00:32:59,640
 Well, basically they the nazis decided and hitler especially because he was he thought of himself as an artist

399
00:32:59,640 --> 00:33:06,120
 They got a load of like german artworks that showed the greatness of germany and put them all in an amazing museum

400
00:33:06,120 --> 00:33:12,120
 And then down the road they got all the stuff that they really hated and said this is all degenerate this, you know

401
00:33:12,120 --> 00:33:14,520
 And I mean, which one would you rather see? Yeah

402
00:33:14,600 --> 00:33:19,560
 Like it's I would so much tragic but front to yet another hitler watercolor

403
00:33:19,560 --> 00:33:22,040
 exactly

404
00:33:22,040 --> 00:33:25,000
 But yeah schlemmer had a load of stuff there and then they had loads of rooms

405
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:28,040
 Like a lot of them were quite anti-semitic the names of the rooms and stuff

406
00:33:28,040 --> 00:33:32,120
 But um, they had some that was like an insult to german womanhood

407
00:33:32,120 --> 00:33:35,240
 And then they'd have a load of paintings that were insulting german women

408
00:33:35,240 --> 00:33:42,280
 And then madness becomes method and nature as seen by sick minds. Oh, yeah, these do sound quite like quite cool

409
00:33:42,520 --> 00:33:44,520
 Yeah

410
00:33:44,520 --> 00:33:53,080
 Very nice. Anyway, that's just a thing about Bauhaus. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Um the movie black swan just very quickly while we're still on millipede

411
00:33:53,080 --> 00:33:58,040
 There was a lot of controversy about the movie when Natalie Portman won the oscar for it because

412
00:33:58,040 --> 00:34:02,600
 Well, there's a lot of scenes which is to do with really intensive amazing ballet dancing

413
00:34:02,600 --> 00:34:06,840
 And there was a stunt double Natalie Portman was good at ballet, but she'd only done it for a year

414
00:34:06,840 --> 00:34:09,800
 She wasn't at the level that you needed to be in order to pull those moves

415
00:34:09,960 --> 00:34:14,680
 Um, but the person who played the stunt double didn't get any of the credit and there was a lot of questions about

416
00:34:14,680 --> 00:34:19,240
 Whether or not best actor should be going to someone who is not necessarily

417
00:34:19,240 --> 00:34:20,840
 I can see that

418
00:34:20,840 --> 00:34:25,800
 And there's a lot of emotional scenes in there and you know, so there's a lot of acting that goes on so it's justified

419
00:34:25,800 --> 00:34:27,480
 I feel like it should be a joint thing

420
00:34:27,480 --> 00:34:32,360
 Yeah, like if you win best actor for a particular role then anyone else in the film

421
00:34:32,360 --> 00:34:37,800
 That had to play whether it's a stunt double or a stand in or something. Yes, they should all get on stage

422
00:34:37,880 --> 00:34:42,600
 They share it, but if it's someone doing the back of your head for a day where you were busy shooting a different sequence

423
00:34:42,600 --> 00:34:45,480
 But they can come on stage, but they have to show only the back of their head

424
00:34:45,480 --> 00:34:48,920
 Zyruska Statue is only the back of the oscar's head

425
00:34:48,920 --> 00:34:54,760
 And and they all have to dress in whatever the actor is wearing. They're all wearing the same outfit

426
00:34:54,760 --> 00:34:58,600
 So we change it from the nominations being the actor's names to the character name of the movie

427
00:34:58,600 --> 00:35:03,480
 Therefore you can have multiple people character is a really good category. I really like that

428
00:35:03,480 --> 00:35:09,160
 Yeah, and then, you know, then it's not as problematic when people eventually do something that makes you go. Oh

429
00:35:09,160 --> 00:35:14,280
 Oh, I don't like them anymore. Yeah. Oh, I still like that character. Yeah, that's true

430
00:35:14,280 --> 00:35:19,560
 Interestingly, last thing on black swan black swan was made by Darren Aronofsky the director

431
00:35:19,560 --> 00:35:22,120
 And he also made the wrestler with Mickey Rourke

432
00:35:22,120 --> 00:35:27,960
 And initially black swan and the wrestler were meant to be one movie where a ballet dancer fell in love with the wrestler

433
00:35:27,960 --> 00:35:30,840
 And that was the initial movie. It was meant to be one

434
00:35:31,400 --> 00:35:35,160
 Cinematic universe combination and then you just split it into two movies. That's a brilliant

435
00:35:35,160 --> 00:35:39,720
 What I would have loved to watch it would mr. Milipede also choreographed

436
00:35:39,720 --> 00:35:43,080
 Yeah, the wrestling was pro ballet is fake

437
00:35:43,080 --> 00:35:50,840
 There's a thing called beat deafness. Have you heard of this? No, it's like I've got it. Yeah. Do you think no?

438
00:35:50,840 --> 00:35:54,120
 I'm sure you don't it's like tone deafness only

439
00:35:54,120 --> 00:36:00,600
 You can't dance. It's quite rare dancing well is subjective. Isn't it really? Yeah, it is

440
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:06,520
 It is I'm more talking about being in rhythm. So they would they'd watch strictly come dancing for example and be like, wow

441
00:36:06,520 --> 00:36:12,040
 Why are they not in time to the band? It's that yeah, well, they would just it would be completely alien to them

442
00:36:12,040 --> 00:36:16,440
 It would be they wouldn't think they're out of time or they're in time. They would just be like, well, I don't know

443
00:36:16,440 --> 00:36:21,240
 What's going on here? He's just moving his arms and there's music playing but I can't put the two together

444
00:36:21,240 --> 00:36:25,880
 Right. What if anyone famous has that? Hmm. I mean, I definitely can't keep to time

445
00:36:25,880 --> 00:36:28,040
 I found that out by trying to learn the drums

446
00:36:28,440 --> 00:36:35,480
 And after many lessons and a very patient teacher realized I just can't keep to time. I always get faster

447
00:36:35,480 --> 00:36:39,880
 Always all the time. And I the thing is I love like I love dancing and stuff

448
00:36:39,880 --> 00:36:44,920
 I did dance in high school. I saw a video and I am clearly half a beat behind everyone else

449
00:36:44,920 --> 00:36:48,920
 Like it's yeah, yeah, I've just had to what kind of dancing was it?

450
00:36:48,920 --> 00:36:55,800
 Uh, um, I did uh interpretive because uh, it's a lot harder to prove wrong

451
00:36:56,200 --> 00:37:03,080
 Yeah, that's the best there are some dances that it's clear if you're a beat behind if you do the oki-koki and your arms in when everyone else is out

452
00:37:03,080 --> 00:37:08,600
 That's really obvious because you'd have to do like group ones as well. And that that that was more like modern dance

453
00:37:08,600 --> 00:37:12,440
 Or whatever. Yeah, so that one was one I was always out. Yeah. Yeah

454
00:37:12,440 --> 00:37:15,400
 I'd love to see just videos of that where someone doesn't know

455
00:37:15,400 --> 00:37:18,920
 Hi. Yeah, so we're actually on knees not shoulders

456
00:37:21,640 --> 00:37:28,120
 Didn't you do a bit of dance me? Yeah you where I'm thinking of your school because you went to a very interesting school

457
00:37:28,120 --> 00:37:34,040
 Oh, yeah, yeah, we went to a riddle steiner school. We did urythmi, which is a dance invented by riddle steiner

458
00:37:34,040 --> 00:37:37,960
 Yeah, so you used to go it was I you know, it's very kind to call it a dance

459
00:37:37,960 --> 00:37:41,560
 What it is is you just give it given a pole and you have to walk forwards and backwards just

460
00:37:41,560 --> 00:37:47,160
 Moving the pole from vertical to horizontal a metal pole. Yeah, it would be disappointing if you go to see a pole dancer and that's

461
00:37:49,800 --> 00:37:52,280
 Damn telling you about the yeti while he walks back and forwards

462
00:37:52,280 --> 00:37:56,840
 Um ballet moves. Oh, yeah. Did you know one of the most iconic?

463
00:37:56,840 --> 00:37:59,960
 sports logos of all time

464
00:37:59,960 --> 00:38:02,840
 Is a ballet move

465
00:38:02,840 --> 00:38:10,280
 Yeah, try and guess it. Oh, oh, I think I know. Yeah, there we go. Yeah, Michael Jordan the famous. Can we keep guessing?

466
00:38:10,280 --> 00:38:14,040
 Sorry, sorry

467
00:38:14,040 --> 00:38:17,480
 Sorry, go for it. Go for it. I was thinking the olympic rings. Yeah, no clothes

468
00:38:18,040 --> 00:38:20,040
 clothes

469
00:38:20,040 --> 00:38:22,360
 Do you want it one more? No, no

470
00:38:22,360 --> 00:38:26,360
 Yeah, so james is actually as I said earlier, correct

471
00:38:26,360 --> 00:38:31,880
 The very iconic Michael Jordan looking like he's going for a dunk. So his arms are out

472
00:38:31,880 --> 00:38:37,560
 He's got a ball in his hand legs are wide. It's not going for a dunk going for a dunk. Yeah, you go for a dunk. He's dunking

473
00:38:37,560 --> 00:38:39,880
 Okay, okay

474
00:38:39,880 --> 00:38:46,360
 Give it a few minutes. I've just been for a dunk. Uh, has it bounced off the backboard?

475
00:38:46,680 --> 00:38:48,680
 Yeah

476
00:38:48,680 --> 00:38:57,560
 Um, that's everyone assumes that that's him dunking. It's not he's in a photo shoot that he was doing with a guy called Peter Moore

477
00:38:57,560 --> 00:39:03,960
 Um, he did a ballet leap and that was caught in the photo and they thought that just looked so perfect a stance

478
00:39:03,960 --> 00:39:08,200
 For this logo. Did he know it was a ballet leap? Yeah, I believe so. Yeah

479
00:39:08,200 --> 00:39:10,520
 I there's not there's not too much information on it

480
00:39:10,520 --> 00:39:15,080
 It's just from this guy Peter Moore who pointed out that when the photos were taken that's what was happening

481
00:39:15,160 --> 00:39:17,560
 So we know that it was specifically that

482
00:39:17,560 --> 00:39:23,480
 Um, so yeah ballet in Michael Jordan land. I think I might be wrong about no

483
00:39:23,480 --> 00:39:24,840
 I'm right about this

484
00:39:24,840 --> 00:39:29,480
 When my parents used to ask me what I wanted to be when I grow up until I was about seven or eight

485
00:39:29,480 --> 00:39:31,480
 I said I wanted to be a ballet dancer. Wow

486
00:39:31,480 --> 00:39:35,800
 Ah legend and then I discovered football. Oh, you get to go on my list of

487
00:39:35,800 --> 00:39:40,440
 Uh famous people I'm calling you famous famous people who started off as uh,

488
00:39:41,240 --> 00:39:45,800
 Ballerinas or I wouldn't say I started off as a ballerina. Um other people on the list

489
00:39:45,800 --> 00:39:48,440
 Tupac. Oh, yeah, the rapper Tupac

490
00:39:48,440 --> 00:39:50,600
 I did it with him. There you go

491
00:39:50,600 --> 00:39:58,120
 Yeah Tupac was um, he he was the mouse king in the school play the nutcracker, but he actually studied interesting fact about the mouse king

492
00:39:58,120 --> 00:40:00,120
 Yeah, not a mouse

493
00:40:00,120 --> 00:40:02,280
 That's the dimensions of a mouse

494
00:40:02,280 --> 00:40:08,440
 Um, also on the list the Daleks from dr. Who bit of a stretch. No, not really they

495
00:40:09,080 --> 00:40:14,280
 So Terry nation when he was designing the Daleks he was inspired by the soviet dance troupe

496
00:40:14,280 --> 00:40:20,760
 The georgian state ballet when they're performing in london and believe that that would be a perfect like he got looked at and went

497
00:40:20,760 --> 00:40:24,840
 Wow, the way they glided he thought a Dalek would be a perfect way of doing that

498
00:40:24,840 --> 00:40:28,440
 Um, and so not only was that the inspiration

499
00:40:28,440 --> 00:40:36,200
 But the very first people who sat inside the Daleks were dancers to help with the with the movement because they understood how to

500
00:40:36,200 --> 00:40:38,200
 Yeah, use their feet

501
00:40:38,200 --> 00:40:40,360
 You never see ballet dancers going upstairs

502
00:40:40,360 --> 00:40:45,800
 Exactly incapable of going upstairs. I think louis the

503
00:40:45,800 --> 00:40:51,960
 Who's the sun king louis the fourth 14th? Yeah, he was into ballet and that's how he got called to sun king

504
00:40:51,960 --> 00:40:56,520
 It's named after a character in a in a ballet. I don't know which one. Yeah, he was massive into it

505
00:40:56,520 --> 00:41:00,600
 He used to like try and do the dances himself like dinners and stuff. Yeah, yeah

506
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:08,040
 So what were they called because I was reading that ballerina is the word that you would use for a female ballet person

507
00:41:08,040 --> 00:41:10,280
 Italian wouldn't it

508
00:41:10,280 --> 00:41:15,080
 So what what's the word? We don't have an english word for a male ballerino ballerino

509
00:41:15,080 --> 00:41:21,160
 Ballerino, you know ballerino's. Yeah. Yeah ballerino. I thought I'd take us down a different

510
00:41:21,160 --> 00:41:24,840
 Laynote looking at ballet today. Um, and this was uh

511
00:41:24,840 --> 00:41:30,120
 Quite recent the director of a leading german ballet company had to be investigated by police

512
00:41:30,440 --> 00:41:35,960
 Because uh, he smeared a critic's face with feces with dog feces

513
00:41:35,960 --> 00:41:43,800
 Because she'd uh said too many bad things about um, his ballets. Yes, this is a terrible story. Yeah, it's a bit

514
00:41:43,800 --> 00:41:47,880
 It was a it was a let's just a drive by

515
00:41:47,880 --> 00:41:50,760
 Who's a drive?

516
00:41:50,760 --> 00:41:53,400
 I'll take some skills, isn't it? Just going for a dunk

517
00:41:55,880 --> 00:42:04,120
 Like so very high passion. It was a critic the critic had written a very hostile reviews of the of the this particular ballet

518
00:42:04,120 --> 00:42:07,720
 It was a previous show. I think yeah in the dutch mountains

519
00:42:07,720 --> 00:42:10,120
 It was called uh, which had been performed earlier

520
00:42:10,120 --> 00:42:14,440
 Furious with the review that was given and they were putting on this new performance

521
00:42:14,440 --> 00:42:18,840
 What's interesting is I don't think he knew that she was going to be there on that night

522
00:42:18,840 --> 00:42:22,760
 It just happened to have the dog poo at his pocket, which makes it more interesting if that's the case

523
00:42:23,080 --> 00:42:29,080
 Come on. No, it can't be true. You know, if he always have a dog with him, maybe like well, what's his dog's poo?

524
00:42:29,080 --> 00:42:33,720
 So I wonder if maybe he'd happen to have his dog with him at the time. Oh, god

525
00:42:33,720 --> 00:42:35,720
 Crikey. Yeah

526
00:42:35,720 --> 00:42:39,320
 I won't lie. There's some there's some reviewers who I think probably

527
00:42:39,320 --> 00:42:42,280
 Wow

528
00:42:42,280 --> 00:42:47,240
 There's the same names will bleep them out. Oh, no, it's a confessional space. You can say what you want

529
00:42:47,240 --> 00:42:52,760
 But if if I think there is a risk to them, I will have to what yeah, um

530
00:42:53,160 --> 00:42:55,480
 one of the so the big I mean there's a huge

531
00:42:55,480 --> 00:43:02,680
 I guess you'd say a sort of soft power thing for lots of I mean lots of very big eastern european ballet companies, especially russian

532
00:43:02,680 --> 00:43:08,440
 So the bolshoi ballet is very very very famous russian ballet. This is interesting

533
00:43:08,440 --> 00:43:12,760
 Again, it's people who you wouldn't think would were ballerinas, uh, but but were

534
00:43:12,760 --> 00:43:15,320
 So have you seen diehard?

535
00:43:15,320 --> 00:43:21,880
 Yes. Oh, yes. I yeah, so know about this. Yeah, this is um one of the henchmen in diehard

536
00:43:22,280 --> 00:43:30,440
 It's Carl. Okay. The big blonde guy gets shot. No, it's his brother. They get shot. Exactly. Exactly. He won best character in 1980

537
00:43:30,440 --> 00:43:32,520
 I can't believe you don't remember this

538
00:43:32,520 --> 00:43:34,600
 16 people except at the end

539
00:43:34,600 --> 00:43:41,080
 Carl Carl the huge blonde henchman who's extremely tough. He uh, he was a former principal lead dancer in the bolshoi ballet

540
00:43:41,080 --> 00:43:47,640
 Okay, uh, well, I because I've been to see a ball show in Moscow and the guys who do it

541
00:43:47,720 --> 00:43:52,280
 They're quite slim, but they're strong. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So strong a lot of strength. Yeah. Yeah

542
00:43:52,280 --> 00:43:55,480
 And it also takes a lot of strength to defect which is what

543
00:43:55,480 --> 00:43:58,760
 Is that what he did? Alexander got enough dead. Yeah, he was on tour in the usa

544
00:43:58,760 --> 00:44:06,840
 Big big thing of ballet defections. Nuri is it ish the cuff. Was it the other guy? Rudolph Nuri defected at the airport

545
00:44:06,840 --> 00:44:08,440
 He was about to go back to the soviet union

546
00:44:08,440 --> 00:44:14,440
 He had his handlers from the kgb with him and he he he fled to the french police who were who were there at the airport

547
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:17,000
 But he didn't do it. Like I don't think he did a cool move

548
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:34,360
 Okay, it is time for our final fact of the show that is james. Okay. My fact this week is that in 1997

549
00:44:34,360 --> 00:44:40,120
 Mattel recalled one of its cabbage patch dolls because it's had started eating children

550
00:44:41,960 --> 00:44:48,360
 I remember this see. Yeah. Yeah. Oh my god. Yeah, because I was a bit. I was really into cabbage patch kids

551
00:44:48,360 --> 00:44:54,040
 And um, and I remember that that was going that particular toy was going to be released in Australia

552
00:44:54,040 --> 00:45:00,280
 And then when they got recalled in the states, they never made it to Australia. How interesting I'd never heard of it before

553
00:45:00,280 --> 00:45:06,120
 But yeah, I mean it's incredible and when I say eating children it was only bits of children

554
00:45:06,120 --> 00:45:08,280
 It was eating. Yeah, I didn't manage a whole one

555
00:45:08,920 --> 00:45:13,400
 It was a toy which had a mouth which you could feed food into

556
00:45:13,400 --> 00:45:18,280
 And it had a rucksack at the back and then you would feed them a cookie or something

557
00:45:18,280 --> 00:45:24,040
 And it would go through the body and then it would mysteriously arrive in the rucksack and and that would be the game

558
00:45:24,040 --> 00:45:32,200
 But children started putting their fingers into the mouths or the hair or whatever and there was really no way to stop it

559
00:45:32,200 --> 00:45:35,880
 I don't think kids were deliberately putting their hair in them. I think the hair was getting caught

560
00:45:36,040 --> 00:45:39,000
 The hair was getting caught. I can imagine them putting their fingers in deliberately

561
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:42,360
 Someone with a one-year-old child that you know that might happen

562
00:45:42,360 --> 00:45:45,560
 But anyway, once you put any part of your body into this mouth

563
00:45:45,560 --> 00:45:49,720
 You couldn't get it out because these because behind the lips of the doll of these two

564
00:45:49,720 --> 00:45:57,320
 These rollers right and they only rolled one way exactly. Yeah. Yeah, and they had um about 100 incidents reported

565
00:45:57,320 --> 00:46:04,200
 In this christmas time it started off just a few and then suddenly like more and more and more people started saying

566
00:46:04,200 --> 00:46:11,320
 Yeah, my kids are being eaten by this doll and just legally I I did find a claim by Mattel that these are all isolated incidents

567
00:46:11,320 --> 00:46:15,080
 But that really raised a question of how many incidents do they have to be

568
00:46:15,080 --> 00:46:17,880
 Stop being isolated

569
00:46:17,880 --> 00:46:21,480
 Exactly. Yeah, I mean they did sell many many

570
00:46:21,480 --> 00:46:27,080
 Probably at least hundreds of thousands up. They sold a lot of them and so it's a very low percentage of children

571
00:46:27,080 --> 00:46:31,640
 Who got eaten by these dolls one is too many, isn't it? Yeah, rather feels that way. Yeah

572
00:46:32,520 --> 00:46:35,400
 But yeah, cabbage patch kids. They're incredible. With these dolls

573
00:46:35,400 --> 00:46:39,000
 There's there's an extraordinary thing that I never appreciated about cabbage patch dolls

574
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:46,120
 Which is basically their handmade to be in each one is very different from like if not even the model

575
00:46:46,120 --> 00:46:50,840
 There's obviously different models within the models each one has differences in it because they are basically

576
00:46:50,840 --> 00:46:53,960
 They're all supposed to be kind of unique. Yeah, like for instance

577
00:46:53,960 --> 00:46:56,840
 I got one. Yes

578
00:46:56,840 --> 00:47:00,760
 Oh, it's still in the box. Well, I only bought it yesterday

579
00:47:01,800 --> 00:47:05,640
 This is not one that eats children. This is just a normal cabbage patch doll

580
00:47:05,640 --> 00:47:12,440
 Wow. Wow. And as you can see mine is called Leona Jade. How you've gone? Is it a ballerina?

581
00:47:12,440 --> 00:47:19,880
 Yeah, she has like a little birth certificate and adoption papers and the idea is that they're all unique pretty much and

582
00:47:19,880 --> 00:47:25,640
 And that was different as well, wasn't it that you didn't buy it? You didn't buy a doll. You adopted a doll

583
00:47:25,640 --> 00:47:30,920
 Exactly. Oh, yeah. Oh, I've got them. I've got the birth certificates and everything. Yeah

584
00:47:30,920 --> 00:47:33,480
 Yeah, I had one called Alice who had

585
00:47:33,480 --> 00:47:38,840
 Came with hair like products so you could style the hair it came with a little thing of hair spray

586
00:47:38,840 --> 00:47:41,800
 So you could do its hair and I wasn't a doll

587
00:47:41,800 --> 00:47:46,520
 Kid like I didn't like Barbies or anything like that. I was more into trolls

588
00:47:46,520 --> 00:47:49,160
 But but the cabbage patch kid. There was just something

589
00:47:49,160 --> 00:47:53,800
 About it. Did you do you know about the cute schema? No schema of cuteness

590
00:47:53,800 --> 00:47:56,920
 So there was a study done

591
00:47:57,000 --> 00:48:01,880
 By a university in in japan, of course, they would study cuteness

592
00:48:01,880 --> 00:48:08,280
 And it was to look at the things that we respond to as humans to decide that something is cute

593
00:48:08,280 --> 00:48:11,960
 So the the forehead is normally quite large big eyes

594
00:48:11,960 --> 00:48:14,520
 The eyes usually quite low on the forehead

595
00:48:14,520 --> 00:48:17,720
 and sort of chunky short

596
00:48:17,720 --> 00:48:24,200
 limbs and things and they believe that the reason that cabbage patch dolls became so popular

597
00:48:25,080 --> 00:48:31,000
 And became like because they weren't they didn't do anything not like, you know before all of these the original ones didn't

598
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:33,080
 They didn't do anything. They didn't eat children

599
00:48:33,080 --> 00:48:38,920
 They think that the reason they went so big is because it violates the cute schema

600
00:48:38,920 --> 00:48:40,520
 So

601
00:48:40,520 --> 00:48:44,440
 Oh, if you look at a cabbage patch doll, you'll notice that the eyes are actually quite small

602
00:48:44,440 --> 00:48:49,480
 quite close together and so there's elements about them that are considered grotesque

603
00:48:50,600 --> 00:48:57,800
 But not enough I find I don't I don't I find a bit creepy and that's why because it divides people and people either think they're cute

604
00:48:57,800 --> 00:49:02,760
 Or creepy and so people would talk about them because people go. Oh, they're so cute and other people go. No, no

605
00:49:02,760 --> 00:49:06,520
 They're really creepy. Yeah, and as we know from just the media today

606
00:49:06,520 --> 00:49:11,800
 If you can cause a divide in public opinion people will talk and debate and argue

607
00:49:11,800 --> 00:49:16,840
 Yeah, my um, yeah, my wife won't let me take this home. I bought it. I really really doesn't like it

608
00:49:16,840 --> 00:49:22,680
 Is this new was it like an ebay? It's brand new. No, I bought it. This was in a shop, right? Yeah. Yeah. So does anyone want one?

609
00:49:22,680 --> 00:49:27,560
 I thought what we could give it away to one of our listeners

610
00:49:27,560 --> 00:49:32,920
 Should we give it away to someone on club fish? I'm pretty sure I just claimed it, but yeah, no, of course, of course

611
00:49:32,920 --> 00:49:35,480
 You should always give away adopted children

612
00:49:35,480 --> 00:49:41,480
 It's just be a double adoption. Yeah. Yeah, let's do that. Okay. We'll work out a competition

613
00:49:41,960 --> 00:49:48,920
 Um, the thing about the sort of the look of the freakish look and so on that led to one of the great myths about cabbage patch kids

614
00:49:48,920 --> 00:49:51,640
 That circulated in the 80s, which I had

615
00:49:51,640 --> 00:49:58,360
 Reading this kind of makes me miss being a kid again and falling for these amazing legends. Dan, you still fall for these things

616
00:49:58,360 --> 00:49:59,880
 Yeah, that's true. That's true

617
00:49:59,880 --> 00:50:05,400
 But um, the the story was the reason they looked like that was because president of america at the time

618
00:50:05,400 --> 00:50:08,760
 Ronald Reagan gave a directive to the makers of it to show

619
00:50:09,480 --> 00:50:13,640
 What we would look like following the survival of a nuclear holocaust

620
00:50:13,640 --> 00:50:20,440
 And to get us used to the idea that we're gonna look quite freakish and it would be normalized by the time it happened

621
00:50:20,440 --> 00:50:26,680
 We would sort of accept it as normal humans being like that and that went around for it. Yeah, it's such a great story

622
00:50:26,680 --> 00:50:29,960
 But um, it it's you know, obviously not true, but that's really

623
00:50:29,960 --> 00:50:33,000
 It's not true

624
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:36,280
 That's so fun. I find everything about them a bit a bit rum. Yeah

625
00:50:36,760 --> 00:50:42,440
 Well, did you guys read about the babyland general hospital? Yeah, was this one at some point? Well, actually it's mentioned on this box

626
00:50:42,440 --> 00:50:44,040
 it says that um

627
00:50:44,040 --> 00:50:48,200
 There was a young boy called Xavier Roberts who discovered a magical cabbage patch

628
00:50:48,200 --> 00:50:55,640
 And he built babyland general hospital where his children now live and play until someone takes them home to care for them and love them

629
00:50:55,640 --> 00:50:59,880
 Right and that sounds like just a bit of corporate guff. Yeah, actually. It's a real place

630
00:51:00,840 --> 00:51:05,640
 So he so he kind of well, we'll get on I'm sure we'll get on with the history of how they were originated

631
00:51:05,640 --> 00:51:10,120
 But in 1978, I think he opened up and I think it was a former medical facility

632
00:51:10,120 --> 00:51:16,040
 He opened up babyland general hospital and you could go there as a punter and they held live births

633
00:51:16,040 --> 00:51:19,320
 At the hospital and there was a write-up on um slate

634
00:51:19,320 --> 00:51:25,240
 Okay, every half hour or so an employee dressed as a doctor or nurse gets on the pa and announces there is a code green

635
00:51:25,240 --> 00:51:27,720
 That means that mother cabbage is in labor

636
00:51:28,600 --> 00:51:32,200
 And it's time to head to the magical crystal tree to watch a baby being born

637
00:51:32,200 --> 00:51:36,120
 The birthing process lasts under three minutes. Uh-huh not realistic

638
00:51:36,120 --> 00:51:43,000
 Um a nurse in scrubs and latex gloves stands among the cabbages and tells the crowd that mother cabbage has dilated

639
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:45,240
 The full 10 leaves apart

640
00:51:45,240 --> 00:51:48,600
 That's such a gag for the parents

641
00:51:48,600 --> 00:51:52,200
 Like if you have no idea the parents are going to be like, oh, I see what they're saying

642
00:51:52,600 --> 00:51:57,320
 As the crystal well, there are very specific parent gags as the crystals at the base of the tree begin to glow

643
00:51:57,320 --> 00:52:03,240
 The nurse gives the cabbage a shot of imagicillin and announces she will be performing an easyotomy

644
00:52:03,240 --> 00:52:08,280
 A pieziotomy gag there as opposed to a c-section which stands for cabbage section

645
00:52:08,280 --> 00:52:14,120
 The nurse gently spreads the cabbage leaves reaches in her gloved hands and slowly pulls out a naked doll

646
00:52:14,120 --> 00:52:16,440
 The kids in the crowd murmur gasp and applaud

647
00:52:16,440 --> 00:52:19,480
 People say that's creepy

648
00:52:20,680 --> 00:52:22,680
 Oh, I'd love to see that

649
00:52:22,680 --> 00:52:27,560
 But it was the whole story was one of the reasons the other reasons they became so popular because it

650
00:52:27,560 --> 00:52:31,240
 Rather than just being a doll. It was this whole

651
00:52:31,240 --> 00:52:33,880
 You're buying into the need us. Yeah

652
00:52:33,880 --> 00:52:39,240
 Like you're actually adopting a thing, you know, the parents would be like, oh, that's a really cute idea and oh

653
00:52:39,240 --> 00:52:43,400
 Oh, my my kid could adopt a doll and stuff. And so yeah, and it worked

654
00:52:43,400 --> 00:52:48,360
 That's amazing. It really did work because they were absolutely massive when they were when they first went out

655
00:52:48,360 --> 00:52:55,880
 When was that going to be in like the 80s early 80s? Yeah, and there was riots when people were trying to get them in shops and

656
00:52:55,880 --> 00:52:59,320
 Um, I was reading some newspaper articles from the time

657
00:52:59,320 --> 00:53:02,600
 About these riots that were happening in the in the states

658
00:53:02,600 --> 00:53:10,280
 Um, the citizens voice newspaper. This was in pennsylvania one pregnant woman bit another patron and knocked his hat off

659
00:53:10,280 --> 00:53:13,080
 I think she was just trying to eat a cookie

660
00:53:13,080 --> 00:53:18,120
 Another woman was punched in the face by a female shopper

661
00:53:18,360 --> 00:53:21,960
 One woman chased a man through a parking lot calling him an sob

662
00:53:21,960 --> 00:53:28,920
 The simi valley star from california said one woman was swinging a baseball bat wildly at other women

663
00:53:28,920 --> 00:53:33,560
 To get one of these dolls and it wasn't even the last doll in the shop that she was getting

664
00:53:33,560 --> 00:53:37,240
 Apparently because all these dolls are slightly different from each other

665
00:53:37,240 --> 00:53:41,720
 She'd seen one that she particularly wanted and she just didn't want anyone else to go near them

666
00:53:41,720 --> 00:53:43,720
 So she was swinging the baseball bats

667
00:53:43,720 --> 00:53:46,600
 And in 2008

668
00:53:46,760 --> 00:53:53,880
 Four kids entertainment Inc who at the time on the license for these they released a special edition of the dolls to commemorate the riots

669
00:53:53,880 --> 00:53:56,200
 Oh, wow

670
00:53:56,200 --> 00:54:00,120
 And did it come with riots? No, it was just like riot gear

671
00:54:00,120 --> 00:54:07,240
 They've become slightly different over the years like this is the one that i've got here is a bit more

672
00:54:07,240 --> 00:54:12,680
 Finally and a bit more toy-like than the originals the ones that they did to commemorate. They were

673
00:54:13,080 --> 00:54:16,840
 Um more close to the originals. Yeah, you can see I mean it's you know

674
00:54:16,840 --> 00:54:20,280
 It's since becoming a parent and understanding the christmas rush to get toys

675
00:54:20,280 --> 00:54:26,360
 You can understand why movies like jingle all the way are so you know, Arnold Schwarzenegger's most relatable movie

676
00:54:26,360 --> 00:54:34,200
 It's that was all about a toy. Have you not seen it a relatable movie? Absolutely. No, I never think of a more than cold in the barbarian

677
00:54:34,200 --> 00:54:38,680
 Yeah, yeah, even more than kind of neither more than julia even more than terminator. Yeah

678
00:54:40,040 --> 00:54:43,720
 It's more than more than can be gone and call terminator three rise of the machines

679
00:54:43,720 --> 00:54:46,520
 No, no

680
00:54:46,520 --> 00:54:53,560
 So zavia roberts the person who invented he's mentioned on the side of the box and correct in your

681
00:54:53,560 --> 00:54:57,020
 controversial highly controversial

682
00:54:57,020 --> 00:54:59,720
 21 year old art student when he first

683
00:54:59,720 --> 00:55:07,880
 Notices that there is a german technique king of needle molding and he sees a lady called martha nelson who is

684
00:55:08,600 --> 00:55:12,040
 Making these doll babies and he goes oh that looks really interesting

685
00:55:12,040 --> 00:55:17,240
 She has adoption papers for the babies. Um, she has original names for the babies

686
00:55:17,240 --> 00:55:20,360
 He goes off changes the technique ever so slightly

687
00:55:20,360 --> 00:55:26,760
 But it was very much lifted from what this woman was doing and then he kind of went off and ran with it and got all the

688
00:55:26,760 --> 00:55:31,640
 Credit for creating this new style of doll. Yeah, because basically she made this doll, right?

689
00:55:31,640 --> 00:55:34,280
 She was selling them to him because he owned a gift shop

690
00:55:34,840 --> 00:55:39,480
 And then he wanted to up the price. She refused and so refused to give him any more dolls

691
00:55:39,480 --> 00:55:43,640
 And so he said well, I'm just going to make them myself then basically that's what happened

692
00:55:43,640 --> 00:55:46,440
 And did he want to mass produce them a bit more because he did yeah

693
00:55:46,440 --> 00:55:50,680
 And then the official website says that he was into needle molding

694
00:55:50,680 --> 00:55:55,960
 And that he learned quilting skills from his mother and all that kind of stuff

695
00:55:55,960 --> 00:55:59,080
 It seems very much. It does. You know, yeah

696
00:55:59,080 --> 00:56:03,800
 So what we're saying is that the side of the box here where it says that the bunny bees

697
00:56:04,600 --> 00:56:06,600
 We're saying they're not involved at all

698
00:56:06,600 --> 00:56:12,920
 No, I think one really weird thing about this this doll. I mean, there's a lot of weird things about this doll, but supposedly

699
00:56:12,920 --> 00:56:15,880
 There's a guy called zavia

700
00:56:15,880 --> 00:56:19,080
 And he runs a hospital that looks after these

701
00:56:19,080 --> 00:56:23,240
 Cabbage babies until they're adopted. That's the guy we're talking about zavia

702
00:56:23,240 --> 00:56:25,560
 But if you look at any of these things

703
00:56:25,560 --> 00:56:31,480
 He's signed all the buttocks showing us the doll's butt. If you look at the bum of the doll

704
00:56:32,120 --> 00:56:39,400
 His signature is on the bum. Really? And I think that's kind of a weird thing for someone running a hospital to do to their babies

705
00:56:39,400 --> 00:56:40,920
 Well, it's like those surgeons, isn't it?

706
00:56:40,920 --> 00:56:45,000
 So, you know, there's surgeons sometimes they get in trouble because there are a few surgeons who've got in trouble for burning

707
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:49,720
 Their initials on a patient's liver, you know, mid-operation and then it turns out you've just, you know

708
00:56:49,720 --> 00:56:51,800
 And it's kind of I guess it's a fun joke

709
00:56:51,800 --> 00:56:54,760
 But that's effectively what zavia appears to have done on all these ties

710
00:56:54,760 --> 00:56:57,320
 Well, maybe sign them with pen and they went off and got it tattooed afterwards

711
00:56:57,960 --> 00:57:03,000
 Yeah, yeah, yeah, it could have been their own decision, you're right. In 2020 bringing in trolls, my favorites

712
00:57:03,000 --> 00:57:08,520
 There was one, uh, it was called the poppy and sing doll, I think

713
00:57:08,520 --> 00:57:13,240
 And basically she had a little button on her tummy that you would press her and she'd be like

714
00:57:13,240 --> 00:57:16,440
 "Ray, let's do a song" or something

715
00:57:16,440 --> 00:57:21,720
 Um, but she also had a button underneath her so that when she sat down she would say other things

716
00:57:22,200 --> 00:57:28,040
 But that happened to be right, right in the crotch, like right, right in the gusset

717
00:57:28,040 --> 00:57:33,320
 Um, it was where that button was located and most of the sounds that she made when you pressed that

718
00:57:33,320 --> 00:57:36,200
 were gasping

719
00:57:36,200 --> 00:57:38,200
 Her going "Oh" and "Weee!"

720
00:57:38,200 --> 00:57:41,160
 Yeah, like it's just sound effects

721
00:57:41,160 --> 00:57:46,840
 So there was a, um, there was a petition to recall it by a lot of furious parents who said that it would be grooming

722
00:57:47,880 --> 00:57:53,240
 Children, yeah, we've got room on this doll for two buttons. Okay, we've got the tummy one great belly button brilliant

723
00:57:53,240 --> 00:57:55,320
 Can anyone think of where we should put the other button?

724
00:57:55,320 --> 00:57:58,120
 You know the hand

725
00:57:58,120 --> 00:58:03,080
 Play-doh had a their play-doh mountain cake

726
00:58:03,080 --> 00:58:06,040
 Cake mountain, sorry the play set that came out

727
00:58:06,040 --> 00:58:10,600
 Recently for Christmas, but the extruder, you know, it looks like a syringe

728
00:58:10,600 --> 00:58:16,120
 That you would put the play-doh in to do the icing on the cake is incredibly phallic like

729
00:58:17,560 --> 00:58:19,560
 If I like enough that it definitely wasn't a mistake

730
00:58:19,560 --> 00:58:23,480
 Children won't understand but you know

731
00:58:23,480 --> 00:58:28,440
 Is there like the equivalent of beat deafness where you're just

732
00:58:28,440 --> 00:58:34,280
 Yeah, and sexual in your window blindness. Yeah to bias and arrest of development way

733
00:58:34,280 --> 00:58:37,240
 Understand all those innuendos. Yeah

734
00:58:37,240 --> 00:58:44,040
 I um, I hosted a make-away takeaway on citv, which obviously went so well. They decided to close the channel and

735
00:58:45,000 --> 00:58:47,000
 Um

736
00:58:47,000 --> 00:58:54,840
 But uh, that was an arts and craft show. It was really really fun. But the amount of times they had to stop filming because they go, uh

737
00:58:54,840 --> 00:58:58,920
 It's looking a bit phallic like anything that you would make
