 [MUSIC]

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:21.000
 Hello and welcome to another episode and no such thing as a fish, a weekly podcast.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
 This week coming to you from the Soho Theatre in Central London.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.000
 My name is Dan Schreiber and sitting here with Andy Murray, James Harkin,

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:34.000
 and Anichesinsky. And once again, we have gathered around the microphones with our four favorite facts from the last seven days.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.000
 And in no particular order, here we go. Anna.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:43.000
 My fact this week is that the son of the man who invented shredded wheat was also an inventor.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.000
 He invented round shredded wheat.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.000
 [LAUGHTER]

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.000
 That was... That was what he did.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:56.000
 What's he an inventor? [LAUGHTER]

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.000
 He actually called himself an inventor.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:06.000
 So he wrote a letter to Time magazine, I think, in the 1920s about his father and growing up on his father's influence.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:11.000
 I grew up on the influence of my father's enthusiasm. He works in every department of his shredded wheat factory.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:15.000
 And that actually became an inventor myself, made some inventions of my own.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:21.000
 In 1920, I invented muffits. And if you look at muffits, they are shredded wheat but round.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:26.000
 Do you think, all the time, he was working in this factory, he was just totting.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:29.000
 Every time he saw a square or a rectangular one, he's like, "Oh, for God's sake."

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.000
 He got it all wrong!

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:34.000
 He had an idea, but which was the shapes.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.000
 Triangle, no.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:37.000
 [LAUGHTER]

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.000
 So, Decahedron, no.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.000
 To complicate it.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:46.000
 [LAUGHTER]

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:51.000
 One other thing he invented was symmetrical text or a symmetrical font.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:52.000
 Do you know about this?

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:53.000
 No.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:54.000
 This is amazing. It's a great idea.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:59.000
 So you have all the letters from A to Z, but you can read them all back to front as well.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.000
 So A is easy because that always looks that way.

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:06.000
 But then B, he kind of had a line on both sides, so you could read it from left to right and right to left.

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:07.000
 And that was his idea.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:13.000
 He thought it was too much of trouble to read from left to right and then go to the next line and read from left to right again.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:18.000
 And he thought you could write that way and then just go down and write that way and then go down and write that way.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:19.000
 That's awesome.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:20.000
 Cutting corners again.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.000
 [LAUGHTER]

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:25.000
 I've seen the text and it is terrible.

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:26.000
 It's a horrible idea.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:31.000
 But there was actually an old way of writing that monks did back in the day, back in the Middle Ages.

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:36.000
 It was called 'Bustophagon' and it meant, as oxen turned when plowing.

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:41.000
 And the idea is you write from left to right and then you rotate the page.

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:46.000
 And so then you read from left to right to left, but you've turned it upside down and so you read it the right way again.

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:49.000
 And they used to write like that, loads of there are manuscripts written like that.

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:50.000
 Why?

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:51.000
 Sorry to ask you.

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:52.000
 [LAUGHTER]

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:53.000
 Silly question.

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:58.000
 I think, again, it's kind of cutting corners because then you don't have to lift your pen from the page.

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:01.000
 Have we said the name of the shreddies father and son yet?

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:02.000
 No, no.

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:07.000
 And the son was called Scott H. Perky and the father was called Henry Drushel Perky.

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:08.000
 Yes.

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:09.000
 Good names.

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:10.000
 Henry and Perky.

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:11.000
 Yeah.

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:16.000
 And Henry invented shredded wheat to cure his, either diarrhea or constipation.

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:18.000
 It was also very on that.

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:23.000
 But, yeah, he had, it was a dyspeptic and he decided that there needed to be something he could eat that wasn't bread.

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:25.000
 It was a bread replacement, shredded wheat.

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:30.000
 At the beginning he was supposed to eat it with a poached egg on top or with like, it was to be spread on.

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:31.000
 It was like a bread.

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:32.000
 Right.

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:36.000
 The family actually put out cookbooks which had different recipes for shredded wheat.

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:38.000
 And a lot of them were savoring not just for breakfast.

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:40.000
 And they also had a cereal restaurant.

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:43.000
 They had loads of dishes and they weren't all just shredded wheat.

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:45.000
 They had other things as well.

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:49.000
 One of them was shredded meat inside shredded wheat.

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:50.000
 Oh.

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:53.000
 That is so horrible.

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:57.000
 There was shredded wheat ice cream, wasn't there?

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:58.000
 What?

00:03:58.000 --> 00:03:59.000
 His restaurant.

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:00.000
 And the restaurant was over in Niagara Falls.

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:03.000
 It sounds amazing how this roof garden is first shredded wheat restaurant.

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:06.000
 Shredded wheat ice cream and a shredded wheat drink, which sounds terrible.

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:09.000
 It's just, I mean, pulverized wheat, I guess.

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:12.000
 They also have roast turkey stuffed with shredded wheat.

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:13.000
 Yeah.

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:19.000
 I'm really into the idea of just relative combos where they do the same career.

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:24.000
 I feel like we definitely live in an age where actors and musicians were seeing their children come up and doing the same thing.

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:27.000
 But when you get inventors, it's so much better.

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:35.000
 My favorite family of all time, I have to say, in terms of what they've done, the Picard family.

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:37.000
 Do you know the Picard family?

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:40.000
 Yeah, but it kind of, it's putting down your own family a little bit.

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:44.000
 Why do you say, this is my favorite family?

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:46.000
 It's not what you say, all the Christmas dinner.

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:50.000
 It's like, you guys are great, but, you know, sorry, Mum, Dad.

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:52.000
 Yeah, no, the Picard's incredible.

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:59.000
 So August Picard was the first person to travel basically to the closest point of space in a balloon.

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:04.000
 And then his son was Jacques Picard, who went to the bottom of the ocean to the Marianas branch.

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:07.000
 Well, and then his son was Jean-Luc Picard.

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:09.000
 And he went boldly into it, yeah.

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:16.000
 No, his son was Bertrand Picard, who was the first person to go non-stop in a balloon completely around the planet.

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:19.000
 So in three generations, they went up, down, and around.

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:25.000
 There's a Picard right now at a dinner table who's like 18 going, what the fuck am I going to be doing?

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:29.000
 I like, so I like father's son combinations as well.

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:32.000
 Do you know what Einstein's son was quite high achieving?

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:36.000
 Yeah, yeah, he was. Do you know what he was most famous for?

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:38.000
 I think Einstein's son.

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:41.000
 Well, let's be honest.

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:43.000
 And in second.

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:50.000
 Okay, in second place, he was a leading figure in the field of sediment transport.

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:53.000
 In the small fields of sediment transport.

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:56.000
 I think that's why most people know of him, Hans.

00:05:56.000 --> 00:06:01.000
 Where's that? They've said he wrote the defining paper on sediment transport.

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:02.000
 He did, it was called--

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:05.000
 So the defining paper of three.

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:08.000
 Sorry, I'm not leading in any field, so I'm putting this guy down.

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:10.000
 What was it? What was it called?

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:13.000
 It was called bed load transport as a probability problem.

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:17.000
 He was very successful, but yeah, not as widely known, I guess.

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:23.000
 And then there was Randolph Churchill, who before Winston, his dad, became Prime Minister, announced his parents,

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:29.000
 I'm going to be Prime Minister one day, and then his dad was instead, and he was rubbish.

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:31.000
 Tried to join Parliament, eventually did.

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:35.000
 Even his own dad wouldn't have him in his war cabinet, I don't think, but he--

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:36.000
 No, no.

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:45.000
 It's not a father and son, but my favourite grandfather, grandson, is you and your own grandfather?

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:49.000
 No, it's not. Pickard and pickard.

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:58.000
 It's Dick Van Dyke, and his grandson Shane Van Dyke, because Dick Van Dyke did everything to make his family.

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:03.000
 And then he has a whole family who got into movies and TV as well, and they did everything they could to bring them into whatever they wanted to do.

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:08.000
 Silver spoon kind of thing. And they said to Shane Van Dyke, you want to be a director, you want to be a writer and actor?

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:12.000
 What would you like to do? And he said, I have a project that I would like to make.

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:14.000
 It's called Titanic 2.

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:23.000
 Has anyone seen Titanic 2? Basically, the story behind Titanic 2, and bear in mind that Shane Van Dyke wrote this,

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:27.000
 Titanic 2 set 100 years after the launch of the original Titanic.

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:31.000
 They decide that they're going to take the exact same course, but this time, no icebergs.

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:34.000
 They're like, if we see them, we're going to move. That's like they say that in the movie, right?

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:35.000
 That's good thinking.

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:37.000
 Yeah, they're like, definitely we're still in clear of those.

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:42.000
 I don't think so when the Titanic launched, it wasn't like you see a iceberg, you make a beat line.

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:47.000
 You have to face icebergs down.

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:50.000
 They're more afraid of you than you are.

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:55.000
 90% of iceberg judges are bluffs.

00:07:55.000 --> 00:08:03.000
 So Titanic 2 is making its way through the ocean, and they get word from back home that an ice shelf in the distance has collapsed.

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:06.000
 And it sends a tsunami towards Titanic 2.

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:12.000
 But here's the thing, they radio Titanic 2, and they say, "Good news guys, the tsunami's not big enough to take you down. You're fine."

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:19.000
 But what they didn't count on is the fact that the tsunami was big enough to carry on it like surfers icebergs,

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:22.000
 which it then slams into Titanic 2.

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:26.000
 Titanic 2 then goes down, one person survives, spoiler alert.

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:31.000
 That's line ever in a movie as well. The captain, who was like this will never happen again,

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:40.000
 leaves the cabin, he turns to his entire crew after it's been hit and it's going down and goes, "Looks like history just repeated itself."

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:43.000
 Yeah, Shane Van Dyke, what a dude!

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:46.000
 I think we should talk about breakfast.

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:48.000
 Oh yes, I do. Have you got something?

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:49.000
 I think you have as well.

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:58.000
 Yeah, I do. So there was a study at Tel Aviv University that found that eating chocolate cake for breakfast was good for losing weight, which is good.

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:10.000
 They looked at 193 obese people over 32 weeks, and they all had different diets, and some of them had a 600 calorie breakfast, including a chocolate cake,

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:14.000
 and these people lost more weight than those who didn't have the chocolate cake.

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:15.000
 Really?

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:16.000
 Yeah, that's good, it's good.

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:21.000
 And the idea is that if you have sweet things at breakfast, you're less likely to want them throughout the rest of the day.

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:24.000
 No, it's not just because there's no chocolate cake left, won't it?

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:29.000
 On sugary breakfast cereal.

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:30.000
 Oh yeah.

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:37.000
 So the first ever sugared cereal was called Ranger Joe Popped Wheat Honys, fine.

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:45.000
 And the man who designed it designed it to actually lower children's sugar consumption, because he said if I make a very slightly sugary breakfast cereal,

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:49.000
 then children won't put lots of sugar on their own breakfast cereal.

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:50.000
 It's not going to work.

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:52.000
 Well, no, it didn't work.

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:54.000
 I think the highest ever was sugar smacks.

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:55.000
 Has anyone ever heard of these?

00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:56.000
 Has anyone ever heard of how one?

00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:57.000
 Really?

00:09:57.000 --> 00:09:59.000
 They contain sugar and smacks.

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:00.000
 Yeah.

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:04.000
 That was the worst.

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:08.000
 That was a test the police were in, and I had been taking notes.

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:11.000
 But it meant you put less smack on your self, didn't it?

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:15.000
 No, it didn't, that was the theory, and it didn't work.

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:18.000
 I didn't just end up having more smack.

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:23.000
 Sugar smacks are 56% sugar.

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:26.000
 So I was looking at cereals, anyway, breakfast stuff.

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:35.000
 And there was one cereal, Kix cereal, which might exist in America, K-I-X, which in 1947 won atomic bombs and atomic energy were quite fashionable.

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:43.000
 It released an atomic ring as one of the free gifts that came with the cereal packet.

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:49.000
 It was atomic bombing. It contained polonium that glowed.

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:52.000
 It was a atomic bomb.

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:55.000
 It contained polonium.

00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:57.000
 It made it very clear on the packaging.

00:10:57.000 --> 00:11:04.000
 I should be clear in case they sue me that it was perfectly safe for capital letters on the packaging.

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:09.000
 I think you've got a problem when you have to put perfectly safe and massive letters on it.

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:13.000
 I will check this out. There was a chocolate that you could get in Germany in the 1930s.

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:19.000
 And this is what it was called, radium chocolate, that quickly went off the block.

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:26.000
 Highly radioactive chocolate, which came with the slogan, eat this and feel great.

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:31.000
 You know, great, Tony the Tiger, the Frosty's thing.

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:34.000
 This is really cool. The man who voiced Tony the Tiger for 50 years.

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:37.000
 He wasn't the first one, but he was by a long way the longest to do it.

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:42.000
 He's called Thirl Ravenscroft. He flew Winston Churchill as a pilot.

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:43.000
 Really?

00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:47.000
 Because he was a civilian pilot navigated during the whole second mob war.

00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:50.000
 And he flew Winston Churchill, Bob Hope. He flew to meet the troops.

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:51.000
 And he was great.

00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:53.000
 And he was the one who said great.

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:58.000
 When you look it up, this is genuinely on the Wikipedia on Frosty's.

00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:00.000
 Tony, that promise.

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:04.000
 Tony the Tiger has been the mascot of Frosty Flakes since its introduction.

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:06.000
 Tony is known for uttering the cereal slogan.

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:11.000
 They're great brackets pronounced as one elongated word, not a stutter.

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:18.000
 [laughter]

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:21.000
 I saw a Wikipedia page on snap, crackle and pop.

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:24.000
 You know, these guys from the, what are they from?

00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:25.000
 Rice Krispie, that's it.

00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:27.000
 And they explained what they do.

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:30.000
 They said snap is always portrayed with a baker's hat.

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:34.000
 Pop with a military cap and uniform of a marching band leader.

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:40.000
 Crackle's red or striped stocking cap leaves his occupation ambiguous.

00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:46.000
 [laughter]

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:51.000
 We've said before I think that Kellogg, John Harvey Kellogg, invented Corn Flakes as part of a health drive,

00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:54.000
 which in a big bit of that was an anti-masturbation drive,

00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:59.000
 because he believed that he actually spent his wedding night writing an anti-masturbation tract.

00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:00.000
 Amazing.

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:02.000
 Sure, if he doesn't need it anymore.

00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:06.000
 [laughter]

00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:09.000
 He wrote of masturbators, chronic or otherwise.

00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:10.000
 He said it killed you.

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:13.000
 He said such a victim dies literally by his own hand.

00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:18.000
 [laughter]

00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:20.000
 Guys, we need to move on to our hands.

00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:21.000
 By the way, should we do that?

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:22.000
 You got anything else you want to add?

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:23.000
 Okay.

00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:25.000
 Okay, time for fact number two.

00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:28.000
 And that is Andrew Hunter Murray.

00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:33.000
 My fact is that in the 1960s, a Canadian psychologist visited cafes across the world

00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:36.000
 counting how much couples touched each other.

00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:40.000
 In Puerto Rico, it was 180 times in an hour.

00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:42.000
 In Paris, it was 110.

00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:44.000
 In London, it was zero.

00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:50.000
 [laughter]

00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:52.000
 I worked out whether it was romantic couples.

00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:54.000
 I think it was just people who were impairs in cafes,

00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:57.000
 so it could be friends or family or anything.

00:13:57.000 --> 00:13:58.000
 Yeah.

00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:00.000
 But I'm not British.

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:02.000
 Is that seen as a very...

00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:04.000
 I see a lot of touching words.

00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:06.000
 Well, this was in the 1960s, so things were different.

00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:07.000
 Oh, okay.

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:10.000
 Yeah, they miss you uptight in the 1960s.

00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:12.000
 [laughter]

00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:15.000
 The brutal 60s, as they were called.

00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:19.000
 [laughter]

00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:22.000
 I like, do you guys know about Nutsford in Cheshire?

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:25.000
 The campaign that it ran at the end of last year, I think,

00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:27.000
 to widen its pavements, because...

00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:28.000
 No.

00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:31.000
 So it's finally been agreed that Nutsford in Cheshire

00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:34.000
 is going to widen its pavements so that two people can walk along it.

00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:37.000
 And the reason two people can't walk along it is because there was this spinster

00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:41.000
 called Lady James Stanley, who in the 19th century, she lived in Nutsford,

00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:46.000
 and she dictated that couples shouldn't be allowed to walk along the pavements hand in hand.

00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:49.000
 And so she funded the building of all the pavements in Nutsford

00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:52.000
 and made sure that only one person at night would walk away.

00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:55.000
 [laughter]

00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:56.000
 Wow.

00:14:56.000 --> 00:14:59.000
 Her Ebertaph reads, "A maid I lived and a maid I died,

00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:02.000
 I never was asked and never denied."

00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:03.000
 Oh.

00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:05.000
 No, she sounds horrible.

00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:07.000
 Why do you think she was never asked?

00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:10.000
 Why did she not like people walking, so by say?

00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:13.000
 Was it because she couldn't get around them, or she just didn't like the affection of her?

00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:15.000
 She was offended by the idea of...

00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:17.000
 She just liked holding hands.

00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:18.000
 [laughter]

00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:20.000
 She got a kick at a single file.

00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:22.000
 No, she didn't. She objected because she was alone.

00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:23.000
 She was a single file.

00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:24.000
 [laughter]

00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:26.000
 Sorry.

00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:27.000
 So yeah, touching.

00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:29.000
 Social touching and all kinds of touching.

00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:30.000
 Touching is amazing.

00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:34.000
 I should say this fact comes from a book called Touch the Science of Hand Heart and Mind

00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:35.000
 by David J. Linden.

00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:38.000
 And I think it's a very interesting book.

00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:39.000
 There are so many cool things.

00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:42.000
 So there are some people who don't feel pain.

00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:43.000
 Oh.

00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:45.000
 So there are people in a place called Norbotten,

00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:48.000
 probably pronouncing that wrong, which is in Sweden.

00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:49.000
 And it's genetic.

00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:51.000
 The reason that some people don't feel pain.

00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:53.000
 So some people are born without that ability.

00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:57.000
 And one of the people studied in this book is a girl called Camilla.

00:15:57.000 --> 00:15:59.000
 At the age of nine, I'm quoting here,

00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:04.000
 she would entertain her friends by jumping off her bed and landing directly on her knees.

00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:05.000
 [laughter]

00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:09.000
 She said she'd like to hear the crunching sound they made just like popcorn.

00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:11.000
 [laughter]

00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:12.000
 Wow.

00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:16.000
 I think the other problem with people who have this genetic problem is that they

00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:18.000
 they would die early, wouldn't they?

00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:19.000
 Yes, because you don't know.

00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:22.000
 You put your hand in the fire and you just wouldn't know that it's not.

00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:24.000
 So basically touch is vital.

00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:29.000
 And for babies as well, if they don't experience a parent touching them,

00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:33.000
 then it's extremely bad for them and you can get all kinds of conditions that way.

00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:35.000
 We're not sure how.

00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:42.000
 But Adolf Hitler didn't like touching.

00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:46.000
 Did you like anything?

00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:52.000
 I'm starting to really dislike this guy.

00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:56.000
 For me, this was the final straw.

00:16:56.000 --> 00:17:03.000
 This is Martin Amos's claim recently that Adolf Hitler and even Braun had sex

00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:06.000
 without touching each other or even removing their clothes.

00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:09.000
 How does that even work?

00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:13.000
 I see me like the necessary parts touched but he kept it to an absolute minimum.

00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:17.000
 He hated going to the tailor because tailors, you know, they have to touch you.

00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:21.000
 A badger being Adolf Hitler's tailor, oh my gosh.

00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:24.000
 I read about this in the international business times.

00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:28.000
 And the way it reported it was, it was saying about the recent claims that have come out

00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:31.000
 that he had sex without touching even Braun.

00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:37.000
 And I said, well, Hitler's already tarnished reputation.

00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:40.000
 Was further question.

00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:41.000
 Wow.

00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:44.000
 So if you touch someone, they're going to trust you more, apparently.

00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:45.000
 That's the thing, isn't it?

00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:47.000
 They'll do it.

00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:52.000
 Richard Weisman did a study on this and found that when you asked someone on a date

00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:57.000
 and you were touching them at the same time, they were 20% more likely to offer...

00:17:57.000 --> 00:18:01.000
 A dance in a nightclub, 20% more likely to accept that.

00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:06.000
 And 10% increase on people giving their telephone number to a stranger in the streets.

00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:07.000
 Just from touching them.

00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:10.000
 Does it make any difference where you touch them?

00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:16.000
 I think further research is required.

00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:20.000
 Does you, apparently, I just struggled to believe this because I cannot empathise with it.

00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:24.000
 But as a salesperson, if you touch people, you're about 20% more likely to make a sale.

00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:27.000
 If you touch them on the arm, we're trying to find incredibly creepy.

00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:30.000
 Yeah, just a light touch on the arm, but it's culturally specific.

00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:33.000
 So they've tried these experiments and getting people to sign a petition in the street.

00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:36.000
 It goes from 55% to 80% of people signing it.

00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:41.000
 However, not in Poland, where you're like a Polish man.

00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:46.000
 Because Polish men react very, very badly to being touched lightly on the arm.

00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:48.000
 A study in Poland found this.

00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:51.000
 They found that people are less likely to sign the petition.

00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:54.000
 I've never been able to access the Polish part of myself.

00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:55.000
 Maybe that's what it is.

00:18:55.000 --> 00:18:57.000
 It's the skin.

00:18:57.000 --> 00:19:05.000
 There seems to be a lot of controversy in the papers when I was putting in.

00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:09.000
 I just wanted to see what Britain and touching certain people in Britain.

00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:12.000
 And apparently the queen is someone you definitely should not touch.

00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:14.000
 You like the queen, haven't you done?

00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:16.000
 I've touched the queen.

00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:17.000
 Yes, I met the queen.

00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:18.000
 No, I did.

00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:21.000
 It's not meant to.

00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:25.000
 It sounds like you knew it and you did it anyway.

00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:29.000
 Just back to her face as I touched her.

00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:30.000
 Where did you touch her?

00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:31.000
 Her hand.

00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:32.000
 We shook hands.

00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:34.000
 But yeah, because I'm an Australian.

00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:39.000
 And the Labour PM, Paul Keating, he was not current.

00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:40.000
 Yeah, yeah.

00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:44.000
 He touched the queen on her lower back, which a number of people have done.

00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:46.000
 And it's always led to massive controversy.

00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:48.000
 And the tabloids went insane.

00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:50.000
 And they called him the lizard of Oz.

00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:56.000
 The tabloids then recommended that all Australian expats be sent back to Australia.

00:19:56.000 --> 00:19:58.000
 Clive James included.

00:19:58.000 --> 00:20:01.000
 Because they ruined their chance.

00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:03.000
 It is a peculiarly sleazy feeling.

00:20:03.000 --> 00:20:05.000
 Someone touching your lower back.

00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:11.000
 I mean, I can understand trying to extradite every member of the nationality of the country.

00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:14.000
 Other people you're not allowed to touch the Thai royal family.

00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:16.000
 You weren't allowed to touch them traditionally.

00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:20.000
 And there was a Thai queen who drowned after falling from a boat.

00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:24.000
 This was in 1880 because onlookers were too scared to touch her.

00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:25.000
 And so she drowned.

00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:26.000
 No way.

00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:27.000
 That's bad, isn't it?

00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:29.000
 I mean, they probably didn't like it very much either.

00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:30.000
 I do, yeah.

00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:33.000
 Because even if I was supposed to, you know, not touch someone.

00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:34.000
 If they were drowning, I think I'd help.

00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:35.000
 Yeah.

00:20:35.000 --> 00:20:38.000
 Well, the law says that you'd be put to death if you did touch them.

00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:39.000
 Put a death.

00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:40.000
 Oh, OK.

00:20:40.000 --> 00:20:47.000
 In Tonga, the undertakers who look after the king are not supposed to use their hands for three months

00:20:47.000 --> 00:20:50.000
 after touching their dead body of the king.

00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:52.000
 But that's better than it used to be.

00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:54.000
 Because 300 years ago, they would have their hands chopped off.

00:20:54.000 --> 00:20:55.000
 Wow.

00:20:55.000 --> 00:21:00.000
 And a bit undertaking courses were not popular in the country for a day.

00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:02.000
 So you can't use your hands for three months, you have to explain this.

00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:07.000
 But these days, you would be put into a nice house and looked after for three months.

00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:09.000
 So it's actually quite good these days.

00:21:09.000 --> 00:21:11.000
 We're going to have to move on.

00:21:11.000 --> 00:21:14.000
 I just got one more thing, which I think is really interesting.

00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:15.000
 Things you can touch.

00:21:15.000 --> 00:21:19.000
 Something you can't touch is the papers of Mary Curie.

00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:24.000
 They're still so radioactive that you have to put on a full body suit

00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:28.000
 in order to look at the papers that are talking about the subject itself.

00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:30.000
 That's insane.

00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:32.000
 I'm on touching in the US.

00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:38.000
 There's been a campaign in US schools recently to limit touching between people.

00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:41.000
 I'm just between peoples, because girls often hug each other, I think.

00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:45.000
 So there was a complaint by a head teacher saying that girls having been separated for 40 minutes,

00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:46.000
 gone to different lessons.

00:21:46.000 --> 00:21:49.000
 We'll have to all hug each other in the corridors and it was clogging up the corridors.

00:21:49.000 --> 00:21:53.000
 So there was a campaign in a school in Iowa, I think it was,

00:21:53.000 --> 00:21:57.000
 which was the hands-off or handshake campaign, which apparently was genuinely successful.

00:21:57.000 --> 00:22:00.000
 Which was saying to girls, you cannot have to hug each other every 40 minutes.

00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:02.000
 Maybe just a handshake.

00:22:02.000 --> 00:22:05.000
 And now girls in this school go down the corridor, see they're giving them a handshake.

00:22:05.000 --> 00:22:07.000
 And that's not done.

00:22:07.000 --> 00:22:08.000
 That's good.

00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:11.000
 That's very much like 1960's Britain.

00:22:11.000 --> 00:22:14.000
 How do you do?

00:22:14.000 --> 00:22:21.000
 Oh, I shook so many people's hands last night.

00:22:21.000 --> 00:22:23.000
 We really need to move on.

00:22:23.000 --> 00:22:26.000
 Okay, time to move on to fact number three and that is James.

00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:30.000
 Okay, my fact this week is that in a very particular time and place in history,

00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:35.000
 you could avoid castration by shouting the word "soho".

00:22:35.000 --> 00:22:39.000
 But just to be safe, always do it.

00:22:39.000 --> 00:22:41.000
 Everywhere.

00:22:41.000 --> 00:22:44.000
 Is the time and place here and now.

00:22:44.000 --> 00:22:47.000
 We've asked the star what do you mean in time and place?

00:22:47.000 --> 00:22:50.000
 Yeah, it's not in "soho" itself, which is where we are today.

00:22:50.000 --> 00:22:54.000
 And this is an Ashanti laugh from the 18th and 19th century that said

00:22:54.000 --> 00:22:59.000
 that if someone saw a member of the chief's harem naked, then he'd be castrated.

00:22:59.000 --> 00:23:02.000
 And so if one of his attendants needed to go into the harem,

00:23:02.000 --> 00:23:06.000
 he would shout out "soho", "soho" and the ladies would get dressed

00:23:06.000 --> 00:23:09.000
 and so he wouldn't see them naked and he wouldn't get castrated.

00:23:09.000 --> 00:23:10.000
 Is it a shanty?

00:23:10.000 --> 00:23:12.000
 A shanty, yeah, which is where?

00:23:12.000 --> 00:23:17.000
 They are going to Ghanaian and they're part of the A-can group of tribes.

00:23:17.000 --> 00:23:20.000
 So if you really had a grudge against a guy and you're a woman,

00:23:20.000 --> 00:23:21.000
 you just leave your clothes off.

00:23:21.000 --> 00:23:23.000
 He's seen you naked, he gets castrated.

00:23:23.000 --> 00:23:24.000
 That'll do it.

00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:25.000
 Wow.

00:23:25.000 --> 00:23:26.000
 Tough.

00:23:26.000 --> 00:23:27.000
 Yeah.

00:23:27.000 --> 00:23:29.000
 Puffer.

00:23:29.000 --> 00:23:35.000
 So the Ashanti laugh was it would punish acts that were hateful to the tribe

00:23:35.000 --> 00:23:40.000
 because they believed that their ancestors would come back and punish the whole tribe

00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:42.000
 if they did anything that was bad.

00:23:42.000 --> 00:23:48.000
 And also they thought that one of the most severe punishments that they had was ridicule.

00:23:48.000 --> 00:23:53.000
 And there was a proverb that was, if it was a choice between disgrace and death, then take death.

00:23:53.000 --> 00:23:56.000
 So ridicule was the worst thing that could happen to you.

00:23:56.000 --> 00:23:58.000
 Although castration sounds a bit worse.

00:23:58.000 --> 00:24:01.000
 They always shook hands because we sort of took my hand shaking.

00:24:01.000 --> 00:24:03.000
 They always shook hands with the left hand, didn't they?

00:24:03.000 --> 00:24:05.000
 Because that was the hand that you held your shield in.

00:24:05.000 --> 00:24:08.000
 And so it signifies the fact that you don't feel and need to defend yourself against them.

00:24:08.000 --> 00:24:09.000
 That's true.

00:24:09.000 --> 00:24:11.000
 And Baden Powell was a big fan of the Ashanti.

00:24:11.000 --> 00:24:15.000
 And that's why Boy Scouts were traditionally supposed to shake with the left hand

00:24:15.000 --> 00:24:17.000
 because he liked the Ashanti so much.

00:24:17.000 --> 00:24:21.000
 I saw some amazing footage eight years and years ago of David Attenborough

00:24:21.000 --> 00:24:24.000
 when he was making a series called Zoo Quest.

00:24:24.000 --> 00:24:26.000
 I think it was the Zoo Quest series.

00:24:26.000 --> 00:24:29.000
 It was this one episode where he was going into a territory

00:24:29.000 --> 00:24:33.000
 so that he had a group of people guiding him around of a certain tribe.

00:24:33.000 --> 00:24:35.000
 And they stopped at this hill and they said, we're not going any further

00:24:35.000 --> 00:24:38.000
 because the tribe that are over there are quite warlike

00:24:38.000 --> 00:24:40.000
 and we don't want to get into this territory.

00:24:40.000 --> 00:24:42.000
 And Adamborough was like, okay, you guys stay back.

00:24:42.000 --> 00:24:44.000
 Me and the camera guys are going to go forward.

00:24:44.000 --> 00:24:45.000
 And they have this on camera.

00:24:45.000 --> 00:24:49.000
 Attenborough is walking over this hill when suddenly this warring tribe

00:24:49.000 --> 00:24:52.000
 comes running over the hill towards him.

00:24:52.000 --> 00:24:57.000
 And they just come, like yelling and they're going, like just war yells basically,

00:24:57.000 --> 00:24:58.000
 running towards him.

00:24:58.000 --> 00:25:00.000
 And he has no idea what to do.

00:25:00.000 --> 00:25:03.000
 He's panicked into a standstill silence.

00:25:03.000 --> 00:25:07.000
 And literally as they approach him, the only thing he can think to do

00:25:07.000 --> 00:25:11.000
 is to walk forward, put his hand out to shake and says, how do you do?

00:25:11.000 --> 00:25:12.000
 Yes!

00:25:12.000 --> 00:25:13.000
 Yes!

00:25:13.000 --> 00:25:17.000
 And then it turned out that that was their way of greeting you by intimidating you.

00:25:17.000 --> 00:25:19.000
 It's like a great practical joke on that.

00:25:19.000 --> 00:25:23.000
 And they came and you see the guy going, oh, and then it shakes Adamborough's hand.

00:25:23.000 --> 00:25:26.000
 But it's the most British thing I've ever seen in my life.

00:25:26.000 --> 00:25:28.000
 Literally on the brink of death.

00:25:28.000 --> 00:25:30.000
 How do you do?

00:25:30.000 --> 00:25:31.000
 It's drawn there.

00:25:31.000 --> 00:25:34.000
 This is completely unrighteous and subject matter, but on David Attenborough.

00:25:34.000 --> 00:25:39.000
 You know, he's the only person who's won a BAFTA in black and white colour,

00:25:39.000 --> 00:25:46.000
 3D and HD and some other weird thing called 4X or something.

00:25:46.000 --> 00:25:48.000
 And there's 5 to 4.

00:25:48.000 --> 00:25:50.000
 That's when he's literally massaging you.

00:25:50.000 --> 00:25:52.000
 5 formats, he's got that.

00:25:52.000 --> 00:25:53.000
 That's very cool.

00:25:53.000 --> 00:25:54.000
 It's impressive.

00:25:54.000 --> 00:25:55.000
 He's old.

00:25:55.000 --> 00:25:57.000
 So the Ashanti...

00:25:57.000 --> 00:26:00.000
 That's what I'm telling you.

00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:02.000
 That is practice.

00:26:02.000 --> 00:26:05.000
 So the Ashanti are famous for their golden stool.

00:26:05.000 --> 00:26:06.000
 Yes.

00:26:06.000 --> 00:26:08.000
 This was the throne of the Ashanti people.

00:26:08.000 --> 00:26:10.000
 It's quite small stool.

00:26:10.000 --> 00:26:13.000
 And it's so important to them that it's never allowed to touch the ground,

00:26:13.000 --> 00:26:16.000
 so it has its own chair.

00:26:16.000 --> 00:26:19.000
 So it's like a stool on top of the throne, which is pretty cool.

00:26:19.000 --> 00:26:20.000
 It's not what...

00:26:20.000 --> 00:26:21.000
 Sorry.

00:26:21.000 --> 00:26:25.000
 I read that the legend comes from the fact that the golden stool started

00:26:25.000 --> 00:26:28.000
 in the 17th century in modern-day Ghana,

00:26:28.000 --> 00:26:31.000
 when it came down from the heavens and landed on the king's lap,

00:26:31.000 --> 00:26:33.000
 which seems like such a strange thing.

00:26:33.000 --> 00:26:35.000
 It's sitting on him.

00:26:35.000 --> 00:26:37.000
 That's how good it is.

00:26:37.000 --> 00:26:40.000
 It sits on you.

00:26:40.000 --> 00:26:42.000
 But it caused the war of the golden stool, didn't it?

00:26:42.000 --> 00:26:43.000
 That's right.

00:26:43.000 --> 00:26:45.000
 I think we caused the war of the golden stool.

00:26:45.000 --> 00:26:48.000
 Well, some blame the stool, some blame...

00:26:48.000 --> 00:26:51.000
 The negotiations broke down.

00:26:51.000 --> 00:26:54.000
 This was when it was classic British colonialism.

00:26:54.000 --> 00:26:57.000
 When the governor of the Gold Coast, as it was at the time,

00:26:57.000 --> 00:26:59.000
 who was called Frederick Hodgson,

00:26:59.000 --> 00:27:01.000
 heard about this golden stool thing,

00:27:01.000 --> 00:27:03.000
 and demanded to be allowed to sit on it,

00:27:03.000 --> 00:27:06.000
 because he said, you know, the queen is your ruler.

00:27:06.000 --> 00:27:07.000
 Where is the golden stool?

00:27:07.000 --> 00:27:10.000
 Why am I not sitting on the golden stool at this moment?

00:27:10.000 --> 00:27:13.000
 I'm the representative of the paramount power in this country.

00:27:13.000 --> 00:27:16.000
 Why have you relegated me to a non-Golden stool chair?

00:27:16.000 --> 00:27:18.000
 And so then the quote I read was,

00:27:18.000 --> 00:27:20.000
 "The chiefs listened in silence,

00:27:20.000 --> 00:27:22.000
 and then went home to prepare for war."

00:27:22.000 --> 00:27:27.000
 (Laughter)

00:27:27.000 --> 00:27:29.000
 Quite right, too, I think.

00:27:29.000 --> 00:27:31.000
 Yeah.

00:27:31.000 --> 00:27:33.000
 The current king of the Ashanti

00:27:33.000 --> 00:27:35.000
 is a man called Atumfur,

00:27:35.000 --> 00:27:36.000
 I say, Tutu II,

00:27:36.000 --> 00:27:38.000
 and he is qualified in accountancy

00:27:38.000 --> 00:27:40.000
 for the public administration.

00:27:40.000 --> 00:27:43.000
 Which actually is a really good thing for a king to be qualified in.

00:27:43.000 --> 00:27:45.000
 Yeah.

00:27:45.000 --> 00:27:48.000
 He studied at Killburn Polytechnic.

00:27:48.000 --> 00:27:50.000
 (Laughter)

00:27:50.000 --> 00:27:51.000
 Did he?

00:27:51.000 --> 00:27:52.000
 Yeah.

00:27:52.000 --> 00:27:54.000
 And he has a doctorate from London Metropolitan University,

00:27:54.000 --> 00:27:57.000
 which is where he did the public administration bit.

00:27:57.000 --> 00:27:59.000
 I've got some Soho facts,

00:27:59.000 --> 00:28:02.000
 but like Soho is in where we're recording tonight.

00:28:02.000 --> 00:28:03.000
 Yeah, I've got one.

00:28:03.000 --> 00:28:05.000
 Well, I say I've got some, I've got one.

00:28:05.000 --> 00:28:07.000
 (Laughter)

00:28:07.000 --> 00:28:08.000
 It's going to be good.

00:28:08.000 --> 00:28:10.000
 But it's on the very street that we're on, Dean Street,

00:28:10.000 --> 00:28:12.000
 where there's a pizza express up the road.

00:28:12.000 --> 00:28:14.000
 And before there was the pizza express there,

00:28:14.000 --> 00:28:16.000
 there used to be an ear hospital,

00:28:16.000 --> 00:28:18.000
 and it was the very first ear hospital

00:28:18.000 --> 00:28:19.000
 in the UK,

00:28:19.000 --> 00:28:20.000
 something in all of Europe,

00:28:20.000 --> 00:28:21.000
 no one had done it before.

00:28:21.000 --> 00:28:23.000
 And it was run by a guy called John Curtis.

00:28:23.000 --> 00:28:25.000
 He was a bit of a charlatan.

00:28:25.000 --> 00:28:27.000
 He used to do this thing,

00:28:27.000 --> 00:28:30.000
 where he would try to convince the patient that he'd cured them,

00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:32.000
 and made their hearing better.

00:28:32.000 --> 00:28:33.000
 So they'd come and go,

00:28:33.000 --> 00:28:34.000
 "Oh, I'm having trouble hearing."

00:28:34.000 --> 00:28:38.000
 And then he would go, "Okay, we'll listen to this clock."

00:28:38.000 --> 00:28:40.000
 And he'd have a silent clock.

00:28:40.000 --> 00:28:42.000
 And they'd be like, "I can't hear anything."

00:28:42.000 --> 00:28:44.000
 And then he'd get some hot water in a syringe,

00:28:44.000 --> 00:28:45.000
 and he would put it in their ear.

00:28:45.000 --> 00:28:47.000
 And while they were doing that to their ear,

00:28:47.000 --> 00:28:49.000
 he'd get his other clock,

00:28:49.000 --> 00:28:50.000
 which made a noise.

00:28:50.000 --> 00:28:51.000
 He went, "What about now?"

00:28:51.000 --> 00:28:54.000
 And they'd go, "I can hear anyone. I cured you."

00:28:54.000 --> 00:28:56.000
 They'd go off.

00:28:56.000 --> 00:28:58.000
 But that only works for people who can actually hear,

00:28:58.000 --> 00:29:00.000
 who don't have hearing problems in the first place, right?

00:29:00.000 --> 00:29:01.000
 Yeah.

00:29:01.000 --> 00:29:02.000
 Yeah.

00:29:02.000 --> 00:29:03.000
 But apparently,

00:29:03.000 --> 00:29:05.000
 this one ear hospital has now expanded

00:29:05.000 --> 00:29:07.000
 into what would become great ear hospitals,

00:29:07.000 --> 00:29:09.000
 so it actually turned into a great ear.

00:29:09.000 --> 00:29:11.000
 Yeah, so do you mind his dubiousness?

00:29:11.000 --> 00:29:12.000
 A little bit south of here.

00:29:12.000 --> 00:29:13.000
 There's a nose hospital,

00:29:13.000 --> 00:29:14.000
 and then way further down,

00:29:14.000 --> 00:29:15.000
 there's a throat hospital.

00:29:15.000 --> 00:29:16.000
 I'm sorry.

00:29:16.000 --> 00:29:20.000
 So where on the Soho Theatre is 21 Dean Street,

00:29:20.000 --> 00:29:24.000
 and apparently Mozart played in this building,

00:29:24.000 --> 00:29:26.000
 or in what this building was.

00:29:26.000 --> 00:29:29.000
 Maybe a seven-year-old Mozart played the harpsichord,

00:29:29.000 --> 00:29:31.000
 accompanied by his four-year-old system.

00:29:31.000 --> 00:29:32.000
 Wait, a seven-year-old Mozart.

00:29:32.000 --> 00:29:33.000
 How many...

00:29:33.000 --> 00:29:34.000
 How many...

00:29:34.000 --> 00:29:35.000
 Really?

00:29:35.000 --> 00:29:36.000
 He did.

00:29:36.000 --> 00:29:37.000
 That's about it.

00:29:37.000 --> 00:29:38.000
 Apparently, yeah.

00:29:38.000 --> 00:29:39.000
 Wow.

00:29:39.000 --> 00:29:40.000
 Oh, yeah.

00:29:40.000 --> 00:29:41.000
 According to the websites of this very company.

00:29:41.000 --> 00:29:42.000
 Right.

00:29:42.000 --> 00:29:44.000
 Apparently,

00:29:44.000 --> 00:29:45.000
 Mulberry cigarettes as well.

00:29:45.000 --> 00:29:48.000
 They started selling and manufacturing cigarettes

00:29:48.000 --> 00:29:49.000
 on Great Mulberry Street.

00:29:49.000 --> 00:29:50.000
 Oh, right.

00:29:50.000 --> 00:29:52.000
 And Mulberry, no, no.

00:29:52.000 --> 00:29:56.000
 It was the name, and then they removed the "U" at the end,

00:29:56.000 --> 00:29:59.000
 because they thought that's not as sexy a look as a thing.

00:29:59.000 --> 00:30:01.000
 And on top of it, they were lady cigarettes.

00:30:01.000 --> 00:30:02.000
 They weren't for men.

00:30:02.000 --> 00:30:03.000
 Wow.

00:30:03.000 --> 00:30:04.000
 Yeah, they were...

00:30:04.000 --> 00:30:05.000
 Mulberry.

00:30:05.000 --> 00:30:06.000
 It's not for men.

00:30:06.000 --> 00:30:07.000
 No, genuinely.

00:30:07.000 --> 00:30:08.000
 They all started up.

00:30:08.000 --> 00:30:09.000
 They were for women.

00:30:09.000 --> 00:30:12.000
 And because it was at a point where women were encouraged

00:30:12.000 --> 00:30:13.000
 to start smoking cigarettes.

00:30:13.000 --> 00:30:16.000
 Which, if you've ever seen an Adam Curtis documentary,

00:30:16.000 --> 00:30:17.000
 what was it called, "The Power of Nightmares"?

00:30:17.000 --> 00:30:19.000
 It's where he shows where one person,

00:30:19.000 --> 00:30:21.000
 who was a grandson, I think, of Sigmund Freud,

00:30:21.000 --> 00:30:23.000
 convinced the entire world.

00:30:23.000 --> 00:30:25.000
 Because at that point only men smoke cigarettes.

00:30:25.000 --> 00:30:27.000
 And they called them flame...

00:30:27.000 --> 00:30:28.000
 What was it?

00:30:28.000 --> 00:30:29.000
 I don't remember.

00:30:29.000 --> 00:30:31.000
 Sticks of liberty, flames of awesomeness,

00:30:31.000 --> 00:30:34.000
 of some liberty, liberty tortures, or some liberty tortures,

00:30:34.000 --> 00:30:35.000
 something like that.

00:30:35.000 --> 00:30:36.000
 So Mulberry was a...

00:30:36.000 --> 00:30:37.000
 And that was just down the road.

00:30:37.000 --> 00:30:38.000
 Oh, cool.

00:30:38.000 --> 00:30:41.000
 And he is the man who invented Egg's and Bacon for breakfast.

00:30:41.000 --> 00:30:42.000
 Oh, that's true.

00:30:42.000 --> 00:30:43.000
 He was the father of PR.

00:30:43.000 --> 00:30:45.000
 And the father of good health.

00:30:45.000 --> 00:30:46.000
 Yeah.

00:30:46.000 --> 00:30:52.000
 And his son invented round Egg's and Bacon.

00:30:52.000 --> 00:30:53.000
 So...

00:30:53.000 --> 00:30:54.000
 Arthur...

00:30:54.000 --> 00:30:57.000
 Um...

00:30:57.000 --> 00:31:00.000
 I think a theatre...

00:31:00.000 --> 00:31:02.000
 The Great Wimble Theatre, in Soho,

00:31:02.000 --> 00:31:05.000
 was the only theatre not to close down during World War II,

00:31:05.000 --> 00:31:06.000
 to spot the war if it wasn't it,

00:31:06.000 --> 00:31:09.000
 because it was an exotic dancing slash naked.

00:31:09.000 --> 00:31:10.000
 What do you call this?

00:31:10.000 --> 00:31:12.000
 It's a place where there are naked women in strip clubs.

00:31:12.000 --> 00:31:13.000
 Sticks, please.

00:31:13.000 --> 00:31:14.000
 Yeah.

00:31:14.000 --> 00:31:16.000
 It was that.

00:31:16.000 --> 00:31:18.000
 And it was decided that it was too important

00:31:18.000 --> 00:31:20.000
 to sacrifice for the cause of war.

00:31:20.000 --> 00:31:22.000
 So the Great Wimble Theatre, yeah.

00:31:22.000 --> 00:31:24.000
 It is no longer a strip club if you're going there.

00:31:24.000 --> 00:31:25.000
 I'm pretty sure.

00:31:25.000 --> 00:31:27.000
 I think it's just a theatre now.

00:31:27.000 --> 00:31:28.000
 Cool.

00:31:28.000 --> 00:31:29.000
 I think it is.

00:31:29.000 --> 00:31:31.000
 You think it's still a strip club?

00:31:31.000 --> 00:31:32.000
 I think so.

00:31:32.000 --> 00:31:34.000
 Look at him, I think.

00:31:34.000 --> 00:31:39.000
 Otherwise, I was a very avant-garde player.

00:31:39.000 --> 00:31:45.000
 I mean, there was no plot whatsoever.

00:31:50.000 --> 00:31:53.000
 So the start of this fact was about safe words,

00:31:53.000 --> 00:31:56.000
 because it's something to say to make sure you don't get castrated.

00:31:56.000 --> 00:31:57.000
 And I went up...

00:31:57.000 --> 00:31:59.000
 Which is what a safe word is, right?

00:31:59.000 --> 00:32:00.000
 Yeah.

00:32:00.000 --> 00:32:01.000
 Well, to be honest, I wasn't sure.

00:32:01.000 --> 00:32:03.000
 So I went up Wikipedia, safe words.

00:32:03.000 --> 00:32:07.000
 And they said, "In theory, a safe word is usually a word

00:32:07.000 --> 00:32:10.000
 that a person would not ordinarily say during sex,

00:32:10.000 --> 00:32:14.000
 such as, "Pide Apple, the Loser Raptor, or Lindsay Lowe."

00:32:14.000 --> 00:32:20.000
 Oh my god.

00:32:20.000 --> 00:32:21.000
 Oh my god.

00:32:21.000 --> 00:32:25.000
 And then another one, this is really great.

00:32:25.000 --> 00:32:26.000
 It's the next paragraph.

00:32:26.000 --> 00:32:30.000
 It says, "Since a scene may become too intense for a submissive partner

00:32:30.000 --> 00:32:33.000
 to remember what a safe word is, in practice,

00:32:33.000 --> 00:32:35.000
 commonly the word safe word is used as a safe word."

00:32:35.000 --> 00:32:36.000
 Wow.

00:32:36.000 --> 00:32:39.000
 I'm going to have to move us on.

00:32:39.000 --> 00:32:41.000
 We've got to press on.

00:32:41.000 --> 00:32:42.000
 I know.

00:32:42.000 --> 00:32:43.000
 It's a change.

00:32:43.000 --> 00:32:45.000
 Okay, time for our final facts of the evening.

00:32:45.000 --> 00:32:46.000
 That's my fact.

00:32:46.000 --> 00:32:49.000
 My fact is that Matthew Ricard, the man who's labeled

00:32:49.000 --> 00:32:52.000
 "the happiest man in the world," is unhappy.

00:32:52.000 --> 00:32:54.000
 People call him that.

00:32:54.000 --> 00:32:56.000
 (Laughter)

00:32:56.000 --> 00:32:57.000
 This is by science.

00:32:57.000 --> 00:32:59.000
 They said you were the happiest man alive.

00:32:59.000 --> 00:33:00.000
 He's a Buddhist.

00:33:00.000 --> 00:33:01.000
 By science.

00:33:01.000 --> 00:33:02.000
 Sorry.

00:33:02.000 --> 00:33:03.000
 Scientists' science.

00:33:03.000 --> 00:33:05.000
 I'm hit by Captain Science.

00:33:05.000 --> 00:33:08.000
 Basically, they were doing this massive survey

00:33:08.000 --> 00:33:09.000
 on trying to find out about happiness.

00:33:09.000 --> 00:33:12.000
 And he was one of the people that they did these experiments

00:33:12.000 --> 00:33:14.000
 on hundreds of people.

00:33:14.000 --> 00:33:19.000
 And he literally, they register no negativity in him whatsoever.

00:33:19.000 --> 00:33:21.000
 He just loved everything.

00:33:21.000 --> 00:33:23.000
 Until they said, "You're the happiest man in the world."

00:33:23.000 --> 00:33:24.000
 He's like, "Fuck sake."

00:33:24.000 --> 00:33:25.000
 (Laughter)

00:33:25.000 --> 00:33:26.000
 What's meant?

00:33:26.000 --> 00:33:27.000
 Yeah, apparently.

00:33:27.000 --> 00:33:29.000
 I mean, I've not read it in a proper interview with him

00:33:29.000 --> 00:33:33.000
 that he is unhappy about it except for this book called Talk Like Ted.

00:33:33.000 --> 00:33:34.000
 It's a new book that's out.

00:33:34.000 --> 00:33:38.000
 And in it, she says that he's really unhappy about it.

00:33:38.000 --> 00:33:43.000
 Okay, they did this test, and they tested the happiness by a metric thing.

00:33:43.000 --> 00:33:47.000
 So, plus 0.3 was the most miserable on this scale they had.

00:33:47.000 --> 00:33:50.000
 Minus 0.3 was meant to be extremely happy people.

00:33:50.000 --> 00:33:53.000
 And he scored minus 0.45.

00:33:53.000 --> 00:33:55.000
 Isn't that cool?

00:33:55.000 --> 00:33:56.000
 He's off the charts.

00:33:56.000 --> 00:33:57.000
 Yeah.

00:33:57.000 --> 00:33:59.000
 He said he's not the most annoying person on the planet.

00:33:59.000 --> 00:34:00.000
 (Laughter)

00:34:00.000 --> 00:34:04.000
 That is Anna plus 0.45.

00:34:04.000 --> 00:34:10.000
 (Laughter)

00:34:10.000 --> 00:34:13.000
 He said when he was asked if he ever gets annoyed, he said,

00:34:13.000 --> 00:34:18.000
 "Of course I sometimes get irritated, but I usually start laughing quite quickly at the irritation

00:34:18.000 --> 00:34:22.000
 because it's so silly, which sounds like incredibly annoying response."

00:34:22.000 --> 00:34:25.000
 He's surrounded by the unhappiest people in the world.

00:34:25.000 --> 00:34:31.000
 I also saw an interview with him when someone asked him about a laptop that he had stolen.

00:34:31.000 --> 00:34:33.000
 And they said, "Did that not make you unhappy at least?"

00:34:33.000 --> 00:34:36.000
 He said, "I didn't feel aggrieved at all.

00:34:36.000 --> 00:34:40.000
 My only regret was that he hadn't been able to send a thief the power lead."

00:34:40.000 --> 00:34:41.000
 Bullshit.

00:34:41.000 --> 00:34:42.000
 (Laughter)

00:34:42.000 --> 00:34:44.000
 No one can be that happy.

00:34:44.000 --> 00:34:47.000
 It's impossible, but he's like a Buddhist guy, right?

00:34:47.000 --> 00:34:50.000
 He says meditation is the main thing.

00:34:50.000 --> 00:34:52.000
 He's the Dalai Lama's right hand man, I believe.

00:34:52.000 --> 00:34:53.000
 Oh, yeah, really?

00:34:53.000 --> 00:34:57.000
 I saw an interview where they talked about the Dalai Lama and someone asked him,

00:34:57.000 --> 00:34:59.000
 "Does he watch the Marx brothers?

00:34:59.000 --> 00:35:01.000
 Does the Dalai Lama watch the Marx brothers?"

00:35:01.000 --> 00:35:04.000
 And this guy, Rikar, said, "He doesn't have to.

00:35:04.000 --> 00:35:06.000
 His life is so full of humour."

00:35:06.000 --> 00:35:08.000
 Although I think he used to watch "Mash."

00:35:08.000 --> 00:35:10.000
 (Laughter)

00:35:10.000 --> 00:35:11.000
 That's TV show ever.

00:35:11.000 --> 00:35:13.000
 Yeah, well, that's the Dalai Lama.

00:35:13.000 --> 00:35:15.000
 That doesn't think it's that funny.

00:35:15.000 --> 00:35:19.000
 There's a good so, as we say, Buddhism is a thing that really focuses on a thing.

00:35:19.000 --> 00:35:22.000
 A religion that really focuses on China, a chief happiness.

00:35:22.000 --> 00:35:24.000
 And in Bhutan, obviously, a Buddhist country.

00:35:24.000 --> 00:35:29.000
 All new government policies have to have a growth national happiness assessment.

00:35:29.000 --> 00:35:32.000
 So every policy that's made has to be run through the,

00:35:32.000 --> 00:35:35.000
 "Is this going to cause growth national happiness rings?"

00:35:35.000 --> 00:35:37.000
 In order to establish, which is so cool.

00:35:37.000 --> 00:35:38.000
 And so they're really happy country.

00:35:38.000 --> 00:35:40.000
 They're one of the poorest countries in the world.

00:35:40.000 --> 00:35:43.000
 And yet, they're about number eight on the global happiness index.

00:35:43.000 --> 00:35:44.000
 Number eight.

00:35:44.000 --> 00:35:48.000
 I think they're about, there are so many lists of the happiest countries in the world.

00:35:48.000 --> 00:35:50.000
 Usually it's Costa Rica, number one, isn't it?

00:35:50.000 --> 00:35:51.000
 Denmark, usually, I think.

00:35:51.000 --> 00:35:53.000
 But Panama recently overtook them.

00:35:53.000 --> 00:35:55.000
 Today, you've been to Bhutan.

00:35:55.000 --> 00:35:56.000
 I have.

00:35:56.000 --> 00:35:59.000
 Nice.

00:35:59.000 --> 00:36:02.000
 They're just all so bloody happy.

00:36:02.000 --> 00:36:06.000
 Do they announce the happiest country at an actual award ceremony?

00:36:06.000 --> 00:36:10.000
 Because I'd love to see the camera pan across everyone's face.

00:36:10.000 --> 00:36:14.000
 When they point out it's not there.

00:36:14.000 --> 00:36:17.000
 Bhutan, I think they're so happy because they have a dragon king.

00:36:17.000 --> 00:36:20.000
 How will happy would be if we called our queen the dragon queen?

00:36:20.000 --> 00:36:22.000
 That's what they call them.

00:36:22.000 --> 00:36:24.000
 He actually went to school in England as well.

00:36:24.000 --> 00:36:27.000
 Yes, Gilbert Polytechnic.

00:36:27.000 --> 00:36:31.000
 He's called Wangchuk.

00:36:31.000 --> 00:36:32.000
 He is?

00:36:32.000 --> 00:36:33.000
 Yeah.

00:36:33.000 --> 00:36:35.000
 You've been funny about that?

00:36:35.000 --> 00:36:38.000
 And he's the last in the Wangchuk dynasty so far.

00:36:38.000 --> 00:36:40.000
 There's been like four or five Wangchuk.

00:36:40.000 --> 00:36:44.000
 He's not been able to find anyone to take his name.

00:36:44.000 --> 00:36:46.000
 He's got seven sons.

00:36:46.000 --> 00:36:47.000
 All of them.

00:36:47.000 --> 00:36:50.000
 No, I'm Smith.

00:36:50.000 --> 00:36:53.000
 Also, Bhutan has no traffic lights, does it?

00:36:53.000 --> 00:36:56.000
 Which may be the happiest country in the world.

00:36:56.000 --> 00:36:58.000
 It's the traffic lights and the dragon king thing.

00:36:58.000 --> 00:37:00.000
 And they pledge to be a carbon sink forever.

00:37:00.000 --> 00:37:01.000
 Yeah.

00:37:01.000 --> 00:37:03.000
 So be a net absorber of carbon.

00:37:03.000 --> 00:37:07.000
 They did use to have one traffic lights in the centre of Timpoot.

00:37:07.000 --> 00:37:10.000
 It's near the golf course, if you want to know where.

00:37:10.000 --> 00:37:12.000
 You've been, you've been, haven't you?

00:37:12.000 --> 00:37:13.000
 I play golf there, yeah.

00:37:13.000 --> 00:37:19.000
 But the place where they put the traffic lights there and everyone got so upset by the traffic lights.

00:37:19.000 --> 00:37:22.000
 They got rid of them and now there's just a guy there the whole time who's doing the job of the traffic lights.

00:37:22.000 --> 00:37:24.000
 Because they thought it was too impersonal.

00:37:24.000 --> 00:37:25.000
 Yeah.

00:37:25.000 --> 00:37:26.000
 Because they're so happy, happy.

00:37:26.000 --> 00:37:30.000
 They need a human to be doing their traffic lighting for them.

00:37:30.000 --> 00:37:33.000
 I've done karaoke in Bhutan as well, actually, with a load of monks.

00:37:33.000 --> 00:37:34.000
 No.

00:37:34.000 --> 00:37:35.000
 Wow.

00:37:35.000 --> 00:37:36.000
 That's another story.

00:37:36.000 --> 00:37:37.000
 What is it?

00:37:37.000 --> 00:37:38.000
 No.

00:37:38.000 --> 00:37:40.000
 You don't get on the hook very easily, yeah.

00:37:40.000 --> 00:37:41.000
 What did you sing?

00:37:41.000 --> 00:37:42.000
 I can't remember.

00:37:42.000 --> 00:37:45.000
 It was some, like, I think I sang some Bhutanese.

00:37:45.000 --> 00:37:48.000
 Because I'm happy coming.

00:37:48.000 --> 00:37:50.000
 That's, yeah, that's all they sing for Elle William.

00:37:50.000 --> 00:37:52.000
 Yeah.

00:37:52.000 --> 00:37:53.000
 Keep the points up.

00:37:53.000 --> 00:37:55.000
 Look, it's coming down.

00:37:55.000 --> 00:37:57.000
 That's the rick as I heard.

00:37:57.000 --> 00:37:58.000
 Come on.

00:37:58.000 --> 00:37:59.000
 Oh, it's working.

00:37:59.000 --> 00:38:00.000
 Come on.

00:38:00.000 --> 00:38:09.000
 Supposedly, but as teaching, there are 84,000 negative emotions.

00:38:09.000 --> 00:38:10.000
 Really?

00:38:10.000 --> 00:38:11.000
 Yeah.

00:38:11.000 --> 00:38:17.000
 And there are also, there are 87,000 drinks combinations at Starbucks.

00:38:17.000 --> 00:38:18.000
 Coincidence?

00:38:18.000 --> 00:38:19.000
 It can't be.

00:38:19.000 --> 00:38:20.000
 Perfect.

00:38:20.000 --> 00:38:26.000
 That's like, how many different types of smile are there?

00:38:26.000 --> 00:38:29.000
 There are something like 18 different types of smile on there.

00:38:29.000 --> 00:38:33.000
 And there's only one of those 18 that makes, that is a genuine smile of happiness.

00:38:33.000 --> 00:38:34.000
 I'm sorry.

00:38:34.000 --> 00:38:35.000
 I have to share the smile, right?

00:38:35.000 --> 00:38:36.000
 Yeah.

00:38:36.000 --> 00:38:37.000
 The mouth smile.

00:38:37.000 --> 00:38:38.000
 I'm out.

00:38:38.000 --> 00:38:41.000
 There's a Pan American smile.

00:38:41.000 --> 00:38:42.000
 Yeah.

00:38:42.000 --> 00:38:46.000
 And that was air hostesses from back in the '50s.

00:38:46.000 --> 00:38:48.000
 Just fake, fake with the mouth only.

00:38:48.000 --> 00:38:49.000
 Yeah.

00:38:49.000 --> 00:38:51.000
 But it became, it was such a big thing, wasn't it?

00:38:51.000 --> 00:38:56.000
 It was the classic, on the side of planes, they would have the classic air hostesses of the '50s look.

00:38:56.000 --> 00:38:58.000
 And it was the fake smile.

00:38:58.000 --> 00:38:59.000
 Yeah.

00:38:59.000 --> 00:39:00.000
 I don't know if that's one of the 19 or 18.

00:39:00.000 --> 00:39:01.000
 Hey, almost certainly.

00:39:01.000 --> 00:39:02.000
 I think it is.

00:39:02.000 --> 00:39:03.000
 And the best one is the Duchenne smile.

00:39:03.000 --> 00:39:06.000
 And that's one you can tell by the eyes because it's the wrinkles around the eyes.

00:39:06.000 --> 00:39:08.000
 Like, you know, there's a real smile.

00:39:08.000 --> 00:39:09.000
 And that's probably why.

00:39:09.000 --> 00:39:13.000
 So there are a lot, there's a lot of data about how the older you get the happier you get.

00:39:13.000 --> 00:39:15.000
 And it's just because people have got wrinkled eyes when they're older.

00:39:15.000 --> 00:39:20.000
 Because it is the happiness index goes up and like right into your '80s.

00:39:20.000 --> 00:39:22.000
 But it goes down until you're mid-40s.

00:39:22.000 --> 00:39:23.000
 Yes, it does.

00:39:23.000 --> 00:39:24.000
 Because that's the least happy.

00:39:24.000 --> 00:39:26.000
 And then from then on, it's all upwards.

00:39:26.000 --> 00:39:29.000
 Which means the graph looks a bit like a smile.

00:39:29.000 --> 00:39:36.000
 All right, Mathieu Ricard.

00:39:36.000 --> 00:39:41.000
 Oh, by the way, Mathieu Ricard has on his website.

00:39:41.000 --> 00:39:42.000
 Did you guys look on his website?

00:39:42.000 --> 00:39:45.000
 His website has a few features.

00:39:45.000 --> 00:39:48.000
 My favorite feature is smile of the week.

00:39:48.000 --> 00:39:51.000
 And it's just a different monk every week.

00:39:51.000 --> 00:39:53.000
 It's having a good old smile.

00:39:53.000 --> 00:39:55.000
 It's actually really nice to look at.

00:39:55.000 --> 00:39:58.000
 If he's not happy about the happy thing, he's bringing on himself.

00:39:58.000 --> 00:40:01.000
 If he's doing a smile of the week website, I think.

00:40:01.000 --> 00:40:02.000
 Yeah.

00:40:02.000 --> 00:40:04.000
 He's been celibate since he was 30.

00:40:04.000 --> 00:40:11.000
 He has a little counter on his website.

00:40:11.000 --> 00:40:15.000
 [LAUGHTER]

00:40:15.000 --> 00:40:19.000
 Do Shen used to, as well as discovering the one smile that is a true smile,

00:40:19.000 --> 00:40:22.000
 he's the electrocute, different men to people's faces to create different expressions.

00:40:22.000 --> 00:40:24.000
 Didn't need to work out what different expressions meant.

00:40:24.000 --> 00:40:25.000
 And it's so funny.

00:40:25.000 --> 00:40:28.000
 And because it was in, it was the mid to late 19th century.

00:40:28.000 --> 00:40:30.000
 Because it was the age of photography as well.

00:40:30.000 --> 00:40:31.000
 He combined the two.

00:40:31.000 --> 00:40:35.000
 And he just took loads of photos of these patients making mental expressions.

00:40:35.000 --> 00:40:36.000
 Because he was electrocuting them.

00:40:36.000 --> 00:40:37.000
 These people were going like.

00:40:37.000 --> 00:40:39.000
 [LAUGHTER]

00:40:39.000 --> 00:40:40.000
 Yeah, it's kind of mean.

00:40:40.000 --> 00:40:41.000
 That's kind of mean.

00:40:41.000 --> 00:40:42.000
 Yeah.

00:40:42.000 --> 00:40:44.000
 I just got a flash.

00:40:44.000 --> 00:40:45.000
 We're going to have to wrap up.

00:40:45.000 --> 00:40:46.000
 That man.

00:40:46.000 --> 00:40:48.000
 Yeah, that's what that was.

00:40:48.000 --> 00:40:51.000
 Do we have any final facts that you want to chuck in?

00:40:51.000 --> 00:40:52.000
 OK.

00:40:52.000 --> 00:40:55.000
 Well, Hitachi has come up with a happiness algorithm.

00:40:55.000 --> 00:40:58.000
 You put a badge on your shirt.

00:40:58.000 --> 00:41:01.000
 And there's an accelerometer on there, which measures your activity.

00:41:01.000 --> 00:41:06.000
 And it means that the boss of a company can tell how happy everyone is in the company.

00:41:06.000 --> 00:41:08.000
 I can adjust things accordingly.

00:41:08.000 --> 00:41:11.000
 Oh, Brave New World.

00:41:11.000 --> 00:41:12.000
 Yeah.

00:41:12.000 --> 00:41:17.000
 I got one last thing, which is that I was looking into just when I was doing the research.

00:41:17.000 --> 00:41:21.000
 I thought, science has labeled this person the something in the world.

00:41:21.000 --> 00:41:22.000
 Oh, yeah.

00:41:22.000 --> 00:41:25.000
 And I only had one thing come up, which was the man with the largest penis.

00:41:25.000 --> 00:41:26.000
 Oh, yeah.

00:41:26.000 --> 00:41:27.000
 I know.

00:41:27.000 --> 00:41:28.000
 Well, I don't know him.

00:41:28.000 --> 00:41:31.000
 [LAUGHTER]

00:41:31.000 --> 00:41:32.000
 It was just one night.

00:41:32.000 --> 00:41:33.000
 I know.

00:41:33.000 --> 00:41:37.000
 James, your eyes are watering.

00:41:37.000 --> 00:41:39.000
 [LAUGHTER]

00:41:39.000 --> 00:41:42.000
 No, he works as a data entry clerk in America, doesn't he?

00:41:42.000 --> 00:41:43.000
 I think.

00:41:43.000 --> 00:41:43.000
 Yeah.

00:41:43.000 --> 00:41:44.000
 Yeah.

00:41:44.000 --> 00:41:46.000
 Well, is he using to enter the data?

00:41:46.000 --> 00:41:50.000
 [LAUGHTER]

00:41:50.000 --> 00:41:52.000
 All right, we don't even have time for the fact.

00:41:52.000 --> 00:41:53.000
 That's it.

00:41:53.000 --> 00:41:54.000
 That's all of our facts.

00:41:54.000 --> 00:41:56.000
