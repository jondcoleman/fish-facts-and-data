00:00:10,00:00:21,"Hello and welcome to another episode and no such thing as a fish, a weekly podcast."
00:00:21,00:00:24,This week coming to you from the Soho Theatre in Central London.
00:00:24,00:00:28,"My name is Dan Schreiber and sitting here with Andy Murray, James Harkin,"
00:00:28,00:00:34,"and Anichesinsky. And once again, we have gathered around the microphones with our four favorite facts from the last seven days."
00:00:34,00:00:37,"And in no particular order, here we go. Anna."
00:00:37,00:00:43,My fact this week is that the son of the man who invented shredded wheat was also an inventor.
00:00:43,00:00:46,He invented round shredded wheat.
00:00:46,00:00:48,[LAUGHTER]
00:00:48,00:00:52,That was... That was what he did.
00:00:52,00:00:56,What's he an inventor? [LAUGHTER]
00:00:56,00:00:59,He actually called himself an inventor.
00:00:59,00:01:06,"So he wrote a letter to Time magazine, I think, in the 1920s about his father and growing up on his father's influence."
00:01:06,00:01:11,I grew up on the influence of my father's enthusiasm. He works in every department of his shredded wheat factory.
00:01:11,00:01:15,"And that actually became an inventor myself, made some inventions of my own."
00:01:15,00:01:21,"In 1920, I invented muffits. And if you look at muffits, they are shredded wheat but round."
00:01:21,00:01:26,"Do you think, all the time, he was working in this factory, he was just totting."
00:01:26,00:01:29,"Every time he saw a square or a rectangular one, he's like, ""Oh, for God's sake."""
00:01:29,00:01:31,He got it all wrong!
00:01:31,00:01:34,"He had an idea, but which was the shapes."
00:01:34,00:01:36,"Triangle, no."
00:01:36,00:01:37,[LAUGHTER]
00:01:37,00:01:39,"So, Decahedron, no."
00:01:39,00:01:41,To complicate it.
00:01:41,00:01:46,[LAUGHTER]
00:01:46,00:01:51,One other thing he invented was symmetrical text or a symmetrical font.
00:01:51,00:01:52,Do you know about this?
00:01:52,00:01:53,No.
00:01:53,00:01:54,This is amazing. It's a great idea.
00:01:54,00:01:59,"So you have all the letters from A to Z, but you can read them all back to front as well."
00:01:59,00:02:01,So A is easy because that always looks that way.
00:02:01,00:02:06,"But then B, he kind of had a line on both sides, so you could read it from left to right and right to left."
00:02:06,00:02:07,And that was his idea.
00:02:07,00:02:13,He thought it was too much of trouble to read from left to right and then go to the next line and read from left to right again.
00:02:13,00:02:18,And he thought you could write that way and then just go down and write that way and then go down and write that way.
00:02:18,00:02:19,That's awesome.
00:02:19,00:02:20,Cutting corners again.
00:02:20,00:02:22,[LAUGHTER]
00:02:22,00:02:25,I've seen the text and it is terrible.
00:02:25,00:02:26,It's a horrible idea.
00:02:26,00:02:31,"But there was actually an old way of writing that monks did back in the day, back in the Middle Ages."
00:02:31,00:02:36,"It was called 'Bustophagon' and it meant, as oxen turned when plowing."
00:02:36,00:02:41,And the idea is you write from left to right and then you rotate the page.
00:02:41,00:02:46,"And so then you read from left to right to left, but you've turned it upside down and so you read it the right way again."
00:02:46,00:02:49,"And they used to write like that, loads of there are manuscripts written like that."
00:02:49,00:02:50,Why?
00:02:50,00:02:51,Sorry to ask you.
00:02:51,00:02:52,[LAUGHTER]
00:02:52,00:02:53,Silly question.
00:02:53,00:02:58,"I think, again, it's kind of cutting corners because then you don't have to lift your pen from the page."
00:02:58,00:03:01,Have we said the name of the shreddies father and son yet?
00:03:01,00:03:02,"No, no."
00:03:02,00:03:07,And the son was called Scott H. Perky and the father was called Henry Drushel Perky.
00:03:07,00:03:08,Yes.
00:03:08,00:03:09,Good names.
00:03:09,00:03:10,Henry and Perky.
00:03:10,00:03:11,Yeah.
00:03:11,00:03:16,"And Henry invented shredded wheat to cure his, either diarrhea or constipation."
00:03:16,00:03:18,It was also very on that.
00:03:18,00:03:23,"But, yeah, he had, it was a dyspeptic and he decided that there needed to be something he could eat that wasn't bread."
00:03:23,00:03:25,"It was a bread replacement, shredded wheat."
00:03:25,00:03:30,"At the beginning he was supposed to eat it with a poached egg on top or with like, it was to be spread on."
00:03:30,00:03:31,It was like a bread.
00:03:31,00:03:32,Right.
00:03:32,00:03:36,The family actually put out cookbooks which had different recipes for shredded wheat.
00:03:36,00:03:38,And a lot of them were savoring not just for breakfast.
00:03:38,00:03:40,And they also had a cereal restaurant.
00:03:40,00:03:43,They had loads of dishes and they weren't all just shredded wheat.
00:03:43,00:03:45,They had other things as well.
00:03:45,00:03:49,One of them was shredded meat inside shredded wheat.
00:03:49,00:03:50,Oh.
00:03:50,00:03:53,That is so horrible.
00:03:53,00:03:57,"There was shredded wheat ice cream, wasn't there?"
00:03:57,00:03:58,What?
00:03:58,00:03:59,His restaurant.
00:03:59,00:04:00,And the restaurant was over in Niagara Falls.
00:04:00,00:04:03,It sounds amazing how this roof garden is first shredded wheat restaurant.
00:04:03,00:04:06,"Shredded wheat ice cream and a shredded wheat drink, which sounds terrible."
00:04:06,00:04:09,"It's just, I mean, pulverized wheat, I guess."
00:04:09,00:04:12,They also have roast turkey stuffed with shredded wheat.
00:04:12,00:04:13,Yeah.
00:04:13,00:04:19,I'm really into the idea of just relative combos where they do the same career.
00:04:19,00:04:24,I feel like we definitely live in an age where actors and musicians were seeing their children come up and doing the same thing.
00:04:24,00:04:27,"But when you get inventors, it's so much better."
00:04:27,00:04:35,"My favorite family of all time, I have to say, in terms of what they've done, the Picard family."
00:04:35,00:04:37,Do you know the Picard family?
00:04:37,00:04:40,"Yeah, but it kind of, it's putting down your own family a little bit."
00:04:40,00:04:44,"Why do you say, this is my favorite family?"
00:04:44,00:04:46,"It's not what you say, all the Christmas dinner."
00:04:46,00:04:50,"It's like, you guys are great, but, you know, sorry, Mum, Dad."
00:04:50,00:04:52,"Yeah, no, the Picard's incredible."
00:04:52,00:04:59,So August Picard was the first person to travel basically to the closest point of space in a balloon.
00:04:59,00:05:04,"And then his son was Jacques Picard, who went to the bottom of the ocean to the Marianas branch."
00:05:04,00:05:07,"Well, and then his son was Jean-Luc Picard."
00:05:07,00:05:09,"And he went boldly into it, yeah."
00:05:09,00:05:16,"No, his son was Bertrand Picard, who was the first person to go non-stop in a balloon completely around the planet."
00:05:16,00:05:19,"So in three generations, they went up, down, and around."
00:05:19,00:05:25,"There's a Picard right now at a dinner table who's like 18 going, what the fuck am I going to be doing?"
00:05:25,00:05:29,"I like, so I like father's son combinations as well."
00:05:29,00:05:32,Do you know what Einstein's son was quite high achieving?
00:05:32,00:05:36,"Yeah, yeah, he was. Do you know what he was most famous for?"
00:05:36,00:05:38,I think Einstein's son.
00:05:38,00:05:41,"Well, let's be honest."
00:05:41,00:05:43,And in second.
00:05:43,00:05:50,"Okay, in second place, he was a leading figure in the field of sediment transport."
00:05:50,00:05:53,In the small fields of sediment transport.
00:05:53,00:05:56,"I think that's why most people know of him, Hans."
00:05:56,00:06:01,Where's that? They've said he wrote the defining paper on sediment transport.
00:06:01,00:06:02,"He did, it was called--"
00:06:02,00:06:05,So the defining paper of three.
00:06:05,00:06:08,"Sorry, I'm not leading in any field, so I'm putting this guy down."
00:06:08,00:06:10,What was it? What was it called?
00:06:10,00:06:13,It was called bed load transport as a probability problem.
00:06:13,00:06:17,"He was very successful, but yeah, not as widely known, I guess."
00:06:17,00:06:23,"And then there was Randolph Churchill, who before Winston, his dad, became Prime Minister, announced his parents,"
00:06:23,00:06:29,"I'm going to be Prime Minister one day, and then his dad was instead, and he was rubbish."
00:06:29,00:06:31,"Tried to join Parliament, eventually did."
00:06:31,00:06:35,"Even his own dad wouldn't have him in his war cabinet, I don't think, but he--"
00:06:35,00:06:36,"No, no."
00:06:36,00:06:45,"It's not a father and son, but my favourite grandfather, grandson, is you and your own grandfather?"
00:06:45,00:06:49,"No, it's not. Pickard and pickard."
00:06:49,00:06:58,"It's Dick Van Dyke, and his grandson Shane Van Dyke, because Dick Van Dyke did everything to make his family."
00:06:58,00:07:03,"And then he has a whole family who got into movies and TV as well, and they did everything they could to bring them into whatever they wanted to do."
00:07:03,00:07:08,"Silver spoon kind of thing. And they said to Shane Van Dyke, you want to be a director, you want to be a writer and actor?"
00:07:08,00:07:12,"What would you like to do? And he said, I have a project that I would like to make."
00:07:12,00:07:14,It's called Titanic 2.
00:07:14,00:07:23,"Has anyone seen Titanic 2? Basically, the story behind Titanic 2, and bear in mind that Shane Van Dyke wrote this,"
00:07:23,00:07:27,Titanic 2 set 100 years after the launch of the original Titanic.
00:07:27,00:07:31,"They decide that they're going to take the exact same course, but this time, no icebergs."
00:07:31,00:07:34,"They're like, if we see them, we're going to move. That's like they say that in the movie, right?"
00:07:34,00:07:35,That's good thinking.
00:07:35,00:07:37,"Yeah, they're like, definitely we're still in clear of those."
00:07:37,00:07:42,"I don't think so when the Titanic launched, it wasn't like you see a iceberg, you make a beat line."
00:07:42,00:07:47,You have to face icebergs down.
00:07:47,00:07:50,They're more afraid of you than you are.
00:07:50,00:07:55,90% of iceberg judges are bluffs.
00:07:55,00:08:03,"So Titanic 2 is making its way through the ocean, and they get word from back home that an ice shelf in the distance has collapsed."
00:08:03,00:08:06,And it sends a tsunami towards Titanic 2.
00:08:06,00:08:12,"But here's the thing, they radio Titanic 2, and they say, ""Good news guys, the tsunami's not big enough to take you down. You're fine."""
00:08:12,00:08:19,"But what they didn't count on is the fact that the tsunami was big enough to carry on it like surfers icebergs,"
00:08:19,00:08:22,which it then slams into Titanic 2.
00:08:22,00:08:26,"Titanic 2 then goes down, one person survives, spoiler alert."
00:08:26,00:08:31,"That's line ever in a movie as well. The captain, who was like this will never happen again,"
00:08:31,00:08:40,"leaves the cabin, he turns to his entire crew after it's been hit and it's going down and goes, ""Looks like history just repeated itself."""
00:08:40,00:08:43,"Yeah, Shane Van Dyke, what a dude!"
00:08:43,00:08:46,I think we should talk about breakfast.
00:08:46,00:08:48,"Oh yes, I do. Have you got something?"
00:08:48,00:08:49,I think you have as well.
00:08:49,00:08:58,"Yeah, I do. So there was a study at Tel Aviv University that found that eating chocolate cake for breakfast was good for losing weight, which is good."
00:08:58,00:09:10,"They looked at 193 obese people over 32 weeks, and they all had different diets, and some of them had a 600 calorie breakfast, including a chocolate cake,"
00:09:10,00:09:14,and these people lost more weight than those who didn't have the chocolate cake.
00:09:14,00:09:15,Really?
00:09:15,00:09:16,"Yeah, that's good, it's good."
00:09:16,00:09:21,"And the idea is that if you have sweet things at breakfast, you're less likely to want them throughout the rest of the day."
00:09:21,00:09:24,"No, it's not just because there's no chocolate cake left, won't it?"
00:09:24,00:09:29,On sugary breakfast cereal.
00:09:29,00:09:30,Oh yeah.
00:09:30,00:09:37,"So the first ever sugared cereal was called Ranger Joe Popped Wheat Honys, fine."
00:09:37,00:09:45,"And the man who designed it designed it to actually lower children's sugar consumption, because he said if I make a very slightly sugary breakfast cereal,"
00:09:45,00:09:49,then children won't put lots of sugar on their own breakfast cereal.
00:09:49,00:09:50,It's not going to work.
00:09:50,00:09:52,"Well, no, it didn't work."
00:09:52,00:09:54,I think the highest ever was sugar smacks.
00:09:54,00:09:55,Has anyone ever heard of these?
00:09:55,00:09:56,Has anyone ever heard of how one?
00:09:56,00:09:57,Really?
00:09:57,00:09:59,They contain sugar and smacks.
00:09:59,00:10:00,Yeah.
00:10:00,00:10:04,That was the worst.
00:10:04,00:10:08,"That was a test the police were in, and I had been taking notes."
00:10:08,00:10:11,"But it meant you put less smack on your self, didn't it?"
00:10:11,00:10:15,"No, it didn't, that was the theory, and it didn't work."
00:10:15,00:10:18,I didn't just end up having more smack.
00:10:18,00:10:23,Sugar smacks are 56% sugar.
00:10:23,00:10:26,"So I was looking at cereals, anyway, breakfast stuff."
00:10:26,00:10:35,"And there was one cereal, Kix cereal, which might exist in America, K-I-X, which in 1947 won atomic bombs and atomic energy were quite fashionable."
00:10:35,00:10:43,It released an atomic ring as one of the free gifts that came with the cereal packet.
00:10:43,00:10:49,It was atomic bombing. It contained polonium that glowed.
00:10:49,00:10:52,It was a atomic bomb.
00:10:52,00:10:55,It contained polonium.
00:10:55,00:10:57,It made it very clear on the packaging.
00:10:57,00:11:04,I should be clear in case they sue me that it was perfectly safe for capital letters on the packaging.
00:11:04,00:11:09,I think you've got a problem when you have to put perfectly safe and massive letters on it.
00:11:09,00:11:13,I will check this out. There was a chocolate that you could get in Germany in the 1930s.
00:11:13,00:11:19,"And this is what it was called, radium chocolate, that quickly went off the block."
00:11:19,00:11:26,"Highly radioactive chocolate, which came with the slogan, eat this and feel great."
00:11:26,00:11:31,"You know, great, Tony the Tiger, the Frosty's thing."
00:11:31,00:11:34,This is really cool. The man who voiced Tony the Tiger for 50 years.
00:11:34,00:11:37,"He wasn't the first one, but he was by a long way the longest to do it."
00:11:37,00:11:42,He's called Thirl Ravenscroft. He flew Winston Churchill as a pilot.
00:11:42,00:11:43,Really?
00:11:43,00:11:47,Because he was a civilian pilot navigated during the whole second mob war.
00:11:47,00:11:50,"And he flew Winston Churchill, Bob Hope. He flew to meet the troops."
00:11:50,00:11:51,And he was great.
00:11:51,00:11:53,And he was the one who said great.
00:11:53,00:11:58,"When you look it up, this is genuinely on the Wikipedia on Frosty's."
00:11:58,00:12:00,"Tony, that promise."
00:12:00,00:12:04,Tony the Tiger has been the mascot of Frosty Flakes since its introduction.
00:12:04,00:12:06,Tony is known for uttering the cereal slogan.
00:12:06,00:12:11,"They're great brackets pronounced as one elongated word, not a stutter."
00:12:11,00:12:18,[laughter]
00:12:18,00:12:21,"I saw a Wikipedia page on snap, crackle and pop."
00:12:21,00:12:24,"You know, these guys from the, what are they from?"
00:12:24,00:12:25,"Rice Krispie, that's it."
00:12:25,00:12:27,And they explained what they do.
00:12:27,00:12:30,They said snap is always portrayed with a baker's hat.
00:12:30,00:12:34,Pop with a military cap and uniform of a marching band leader.
00:12:34,00:12:40,Crackle's red or striped stocking cap leaves his occupation ambiguous.
00:12:40,00:12:46,[laughter]
00:12:46,00:12:51,"We've said before I think that Kellogg, John Harvey Kellogg, invented Corn Flakes as part of a health drive,"
00:12:51,00:12:54,"which in a big bit of that was an anti-masturbation drive,"
00:12:54,00:12:59,because he believed that he actually spent his wedding night writing an anti-masturbation tract.
00:12:59,00:13:00,Amazing.
00:13:00,00:13:02,"Sure, if he doesn't need it anymore."
00:13:02,00:13:06,[laughter]
00:13:06,00:13:09,"He wrote of masturbators, chronic or otherwise."
00:13:09,00:13:10,He said it killed you.
00:13:10,00:13:13,He said such a victim dies literally by his own hand.
00:13:13,00:13:18,[laughter]
00:13:18,00:13:20,"Guys, we need to move on to our hands."
00:13:20,00:13:21,"By the way, should we do that?"
00:13:21,00:13:22,You got anything else you want to add?
00:13:22,00:13:23,Okay.
00:13:23,00:13:25,"Okay, time for fact number two."
00:13:25,00:13:28,And that is Andrew Hunter Murray.
00:13:28,00:13:33,"My fact is that in the 1960s, a Canadian psychologist visited cafes across the world"
00:13:33,00:13:36,counting how much couples touched each other.
00:13:36,00:13:40,"In Puerto Rico, it was 180 times in an hour."
00:13:40,00:13:42,"In Paris, it was 110."
00:13:42,00:13:44,"In London, it was zero."
00:13:44,00:13:50,[laughter]
00:13:50,00:13:52,I worked out whether it was romantic couples.
00:13:52,00:13:54,"I think it was just people who were impairs in cafes,"
00:13:54,00:13:57,so it could be friends or family or anything.
00:13:57,00:13:58,Yeah.
00:13:58,00:14:00,But I'm not British.
00:14:00,00:14:02,Is that seen as a very...
00:14:02,00:14:04,I see a lot of touching words.
00:14:04,00:14:06,"Well, this was in the 1960s, so things were different."
00:14:06,00:14:07,"Oh, okay."
00:14:07,00:14:10,"Yeah, they miss you uptight in the 1960s."
00:14:10,00:14:12,[laughter]
00:14:12,00:14:15,"The brutal 60s, as they were called."
00:14:15,00:14:19,[laughter]
00:14:19,00:14:22,"I like, do you guys know about Nutsford in Cheshire?"
00:14:22,00:14:25,"The campaign that it ran at the end of last year, I think,"
00:14:25,00:14:27,"to widen its pavements, because..."
00:14:27,00:14:28,No.
00:14:28,00:14:31,So it's finally been agreed that Nutsford in Cheshire
00:14:31,00:14:34,is going to widen its pavements so that two people can walk along it.
00:14:34,00:14:37,And the reason two people can't walk along it is because there was this spinster
00:14:37,00:14:41,"called Lady James Stanley, who in the 19th century, she lived in Nutsford,"
00:14:41,00:14:46,and she dictated that couples shouldn't be allowed to walk along the pavements hand in hand.
00:14:46,00:14:49,And so she funded the building of all the pavements in Nutsford
00:14:49,00:14:52,and made sure that only one person at night would walk away.
00:14:52,00:14:55,[laughter]
00:14:55,00:14:56,Wow.
00:14:56,00:14:59,"Her Ebertaph reads, ""A maid I lived and a maid I died,"
00:14:59,00:15:02,"I never was asked and never denied."""
00:15:02,00:15:03,Oh.
00:15:03,00:15:05,"No, she sounds horrible."
00:15:05,00:15:07,Why do you think she was never asked?
00:15:07,00:15:10,"Why did she not like people walking, so by say?"
00:15:10,00:15:13,"Was it because she couldn't get around them, or she just didn't like the affection of her?"
00:15:13,00:15:15,She was offended by the idea of...
00:15:15,00:15:17,She just liked holding hands.
00:15:17,00:15:18,[laughter]
00:15:18,00:15:20,She got a kick at a single file.
00:15:20,00:15:22,"No, she didn't. She objected because she was alone."
00:15:22,00:15:23,She was a single file.
00:15:23,00:15:24,[laughter]
00:15:24,00:15:26,Sorry.
00:15:26,00:15:27,"So yeah, touching."
00:15:27,00:15:29,Social touching and all kinds of touching.
00:15:29,00:15:30,Touching is amazing.
00:15:30,00:15:34,I should say this fact comes from a book called Touch the Science of Hand Heart and Mind
00:15:34,00:15:35,by David J. Linden.
00:15:35,00:15:38,And I think it's a very interesting book.
00:15:38,00:15:39,There are so many cool things.
00:15:39,00:15:42,So there are some people who don't feel pain.
00:15:42,00:15:43,Oh.
00:15:43,00:15:45,"So there are people in a place called Norbotten,"
00:15:45,00:15:48,"probably pronouncing that wrong, which is in Sweden."
00:15:48,00:15:49,And it's genetic.
00:15:49,00:15:51,The reason that some people don't feel pain.
00:15:51,00:15:53,So some people are born without that ability.
00:15:53,00:15:57,And one of the people studied in this book is a girl called Camilla.
00:15:57,00:15:59,"At the age of nine, I'm quoting here,"
00:15:59,00:16:04,she would entertain her friends by jumping off her bed and landing directly on her knees.
00:16:04,00:16:05,[laughter]
00:16:05,00:16:09,She said she'd like to hear the crunching sound they made just like popcorn.
00:16:09,00:16:11,[laughter]
00:16:11,00:16:12,Wow.
00:16:12,00:16:16,I think the other problem with people who have this genetic problem is that they
00:16:16,00:16:18,"they would die early, wouldn't they?"
00:16:18,00:16:19,"Yes, because you don't know."
00:16:19,00:16:22,You put your hand in the fire and you just wouldn't know that it's not.
00:16:22,00:16:24,So basically touch is vital.
00:16:24,00:16:29,"And for babies as well, if they don't experience a parent touching them,"
00:16:29,00:16:33,then it's extremely bad for them and you can get all kinds of conditions that way.
00:16:33,00:16:35,We're not sure how.
00:16:35,00:16:42,But Adolf Hitler didn't like touching.
00:16:42,00:16:46,Did you like anything?
00:16:46,00:16:52,I'm starting to really dislike this guy.
00:16:52,00:16:56,"For me, this was the final straw."
00:16:56,00:17:03,This is Martin Amos's claim recently that Adolf Hitler and even Braun had sex
00:17:03,00:17:06,without touching each other or even removing their clothes.
00:17:06,00:17:09,How does that even work?
00:17:09,00:17:13,I see me like the necessary parts touched but he kept it to an absolute minimum.
00:17:13,00:17:17,"He hated going to the tailor because tailors, you know, they have to touch you."
00:17:17,00:17:21,"A badger being Adolf Hitler's tailor, oh my gosh."
00:17:21,00:17:24,I read about this in the international business times.
00:17:24,00:17:28,"And the way it reported it was, it was saying about the recent claims that have come out"
00:17:28,00:17:31,that he had sex without touching even Braun.
00:17:31,00:17:37,"And I said, well, Hitler's already tarnished reputation."
00:17:37,00:17:40,Was further question.
00:17:40,00:17:41,Wow.
00:17:41,00:17:44,"So if you touch someone, they're going to trust you more, apparently."
00:17:44,00:17:45,"That's the thing, isn't it?"
00:17:45,00:17:47,They'll do it.
00:17:47,00:17:52,Richard Weisman did a study on this and found that when you asked someone on a date
00:17:52,00:17:57,"and you were touching them at the same time, they were 20% more likely to offer..."
00:17:57,00:18:01,"A dance in a nightclub, 20% more likely to accept that."
00:18:01,00:18:06,And 10% increase on people giving their telephone number to a stranger in the streets.
00:18:06,00:18:07,Just from touching them.
00:18:07,00:18:10,Does it make any difference where you touch them?
00:18:10,00:18:16,I think further research is required.
00:18:16,00:18:20,"Does you, apparently, I just struggled to believe this because I cannot empathise with it."
00:18:20,00:18:24,"But as a salesperson, if you touch people, you're about 20% more likely to make a sale."
00:18:24,00:18:27,"If you touch them on the arm, we're trying to find incredibly creepy."
00:18:27,00:18:30,"Yeah, just a light touch on the arm, but it's culturally specific."
00:18:30,00:18:33,So they've tried these experiments and getting people to sign a petition in the street.
00:18:33,00:18:36,It goes from 55% to 80% of people signing it.
00:18:36,00:18:41,"However, not in Poland, where you're like a Polish man."
00:18:41,00:18:46,"Because Polish men react very, very badly to being touched lightly on the arm."
00:18:46,00:18:48,A study in Poland found this.
00:18:48,00:18:51,They found that people are less likely to sign the petition.
00:18:51,00:18:54,I've never been able to access the Polish part of myself.
00:18:54,00:18:55,Maybe that's what it is.
00:18:55,00:18:57,It's the skin.
00:18:57,00:19:05,There seems to be a lot of controversy in the papers when I was putting in.
00:19:05,00:19:09,I just wanted to see what Britain and touching certain people in Britain.
00:19:09,00:19:12,And apparently the queen is someone you definitely should not touch.
00:19:12,00:19:14,"You like the queen, haven't you done?"
00:19:14,00:19:16,I've touched the queen.
00:19:16,00:19:17,"Yes, I met the queen."
00:19:17,00:19:18,"No, I did."
00:19:18,00:19:21,It's not meant to.
00:19:21,00:19:25,It sounds like you knew it and you did it anyway.
00:19:25,00:19:29,Just back to her face as I touched her.
00:19:29,00:19:30,Where did you touch her?
00:19:30,00:19:31,Her hand.
00:19:31,00:19:32,We shook hands.
00:19:32,00:19:34,"But yeah, because I'm an Australian."
00:19:34,00:19:39,"And the Labour PM, Paul Keating, he was not current."
00:19:39,00:19:40,"Yeah, yeah."
00:19:40,00:19:44,"He touched the queen on her lower back, which a number of people have done."
00:19:44,00:19:46,And it's always led to massive controversy.
00:19:46,00:19:48,And the tabloids went insane.
00:19:48,00:19:50,And they called him the lizard of Oz.
00:19:50,00:19:56,The tabloids then recommended that all Australian expats be sent back to Australia.
00:19:56,00:19:58,Clive James included.
00:19:58,00:20:01,Because they ruined their chance.
00:20:01,00:20:03,It is a peculiarly sleazy feeling.
00:20:03,00:20:05,Someone touching your lower back.
00:20:05,00:20:11,"I mean, I can understand trying to extradite every member of the nationality of the country."
00:20:11,00:20:14,Other people you're not allowed to touch the Thai royal family.
00:20:14,00:20:16,You weren't allowed to touch them traditionally.
00:20:16,00:20:20,And there was a Thai queen who drowned after falling from a boat.
00:20:20,00:20:24,This was in 1880 because onlookers were too scared to touch her.
00:20:24,00:20:25,And so she drowned.
00:20:25,00:20:26,No way.
00:20:26,00:20:27,"That's bad, isn't it?"
00:20:27,00:20:29,"I mean, they probably didn't like it very much either."
00:20:29,00:20:30,"I do, yeah."
00:20:30,00:20:33,"Because even if I was supposed to, you know, not touch someone."
00:20:33,00:20:34,"If they were drowning, I think I'd help."
00:20:34,00:20:35,Yeah.
00:20:35,00:20:38,"Well, the law says that you'd be put to death if you did touch them."
00:20:38,00:20:39,Put a death.
00:20:39,00:20:40,"Oh, OK."
00:20:40,00:20:47,"In Tonga, the undertakers who look after the king are not supposed to use their hands for three months"
00:20:47,00:20:50,after touching their dead body of the king.
00:20:50,00:20:52,But that's better than it used to be.
00:20:52,00:20:54,"Because 300 years ago, they would have their hands chopped off."
00:20:54,00:20:55,Wow.
00:20:55,00:21:00,And a bit undertaking courses were not popular in the country for a day.
00:21:00,00:21:02,"So you can't use your hands for three months, you have to explain this."
00:21:02,00:21:07,"But these days, you would be put into a nice house and looked after for three months."
00:21:07,00:21:09,So it's actually quite good these days.
00:21:09,00:21:11,We're going to have to move on.
00:21:11,00:21:14,"I just got one more thing, which I think is really interesting."
00:21:14,00:21:15,Things you can touch.
00:21:15,00:21:19,Something you can't touch is the papers of Mary Curie.
00:21:19,00:21:24,They're still so radioactive that you have to put on a full body suit
00:21:24,00:21:28,in order to look at the papers that are talking about the subject itself.
00:21:28,00:21:30,That's insane.
00:21:30,00:21:32,I'm on touching in the US.
00:21:32,00:21:38,There's been a campaign in US schools recently to limit touching between people.
00:21:38,00:21:41,"I'm just between peoples, because girls often hug each other, I think."
00:21:41,00:21:45,"So there was a complaint by a head teacher saying that girls having been separated for 40 minutes,"
00:21:45,00:21:46,gone to different lessons.
00:21:46,00:21:49,We'll have to all hug each other in the corridors and it was clogging up the corridors.
00:21:49,00:21:53,"So there was a campaign in a school in Iowa, I think it was,"
00:21:53,00:21:57,"which was the hands-off or handshake campaign, which apparently was genuinely successful."
00:21:57,00:22:00,"Which was saying to girls, you cannot have to hug each other every 40 minutes."
00:22:00,00:22:02,Maybe just a handshake.
00:22:02,00:22:05,"And now girls in this school go down the corridor, see they're giving them a handshake."
00:22:05,00:22:07,And that's not done.
00:22:07,00:22:08,That's good.
00:22:08,00:22:11,That's very much like 1960's Britain.
00:22:11,00:22:14,How do you do?
00:22:14,00:22:21,"Oh, I shook so many people's hands last night."
00:22:21,00:22:23,We really need to move on.
00:22:23,00:22:26,"Okay, time to move on to fact number three and that is James."
00:22:26,00:22:30,"Okay, my fact this week is that in a very particular time and place in history,"
00:22:30,00:22:35,"you could avoid castration by shouting the word ""soho""."
00:22:35,00:22:39,"But just to be safe, always do it."
00:22:39,00:22:41,Everywhere.
00:22:41,00:22:44,Is the time and place here and now.
00:22:44,00:22:47,We've asked the star what do you mean in time and place?
00:22:47,00:22:50,"Yeah, it's not in ""soho"" itself, which is where we are today."
00:22:50,00:22:54,And this is an Ashanti laugh from the 18th and 19th century that said
00:22:54,00:22:59,"that if someone saw a member of the chief's harem naked, then he'd be castrated."
00:22:59,00:23:02,"And so if one of his attendants needed to go into the harem,"
00:23:02,00:23:06,"he would shout out ""soho"", ""soho"" and the ladies would get dressed"
00:23:06,00:23:09,and so he wouldn't see them naked and he wouldn't get castrated.
00:23:09,00:23:10,Is it a shanty?
00:23:10,00:23:12,"A shanty, yeah, which is where?"
00:23:12,00:23:17,They are going to Ghanaian and they're part of the A-can group of tribes.
00:23:17,00:23:20,"So if you really had a grudge against a guy and you're a woman,"
00:23:20,00:23:21,you just leave your clothes off.
00:23:21,00:23:23,"He's seen you naked, he gets castrated."
00:23:23,00:23:24,That'll do it.
00:23:24,00:23:25,Wow.
00:23:25,00:23:26,Tough.
00:23:26,00:23:27,Yeah.
00:23:27,00:23:29,Puffer.
00:23:29,00:23:35,So the Ashanti laugh was it would punish acts that were hateful to the tribe
00:23:35,00:23:40,because they believed that their ancestors would come back and punish the whole tribe
00:23:40,00:23:42,if they did anything that was bad.
00:23:42,00:23:48,And also they thought that one of the most severe punishments that they had was ridicule.
00:23:48,00:23:53,"And there was a proverb that was, if it was a choice between disgrace and death, then take death."
00:23:53,00:23:56,So ridicule was the worst thing that could happen to you.
00:23:56,00:23:58,Although castration sounds a bit worse.
00:23:58,00:24:01,They always shook hands because we sort of took my hand shaking.
00:24:01,00:24:03,"They always shook hands with the left hand, didn't they?"
00:24:03,00:24:05,Because that was the hand that you held your shield in.
00:24:05,00:24:08,And so it signifies the fact that you don't feel and need to defend yourself against them.
00:24:08,00:24:09,That's true.
00:24:09,00:24:11,And Baden Powell was a big fan of the Ashanti.
00:24:11,00:24:15,And that's why Boy Scouts were traditionally supposed to shake with the left hand
00:24:15,00:24:17,because he liked the Ashanti so much.
00:24:17,00:24:21,I saw some amazing footage eight years and years ago of David Attenborough
00:24:21,00:24:24,when he was making a series called Zoo Quest.
00:24:24,00:24:26,I think it was the Zoo Quest series.
00:24:26,00:24:29,It was this one episode where he was going into a territory
00:24:29,00:24:33,so that he had a group of people guiding him around of a certain tribe.
00:24:33,00:24:35,"And they stopped at this hill and they said, we're not going any further"
00:24:35,00:24:38,because the tribe that are over there are quite warlike
00:24:38,00:24:40,and we don't want to get into this territory.
00:24:40,00:24:42,"And Adamborough was like, okay, you guys stay back."
00:24:42,00:24:44,Me and the camera guys are going to go forward.
00:24:44,00:24:45,And they have this on camera.
00:24:45,00:24:49,Attenborough is walking over this hill when suddenly this warring tribe
00:24:49,00:24:52,comes running over the hill towards him.
00:24:52,00:24:57,"And they just come, like yelling and they're going, like just war yells basically,"
00:24:57,00:24:58,running towards him.
00:24:58,00:25:00,And he has no idea what to do.
00:25:00,00:25:03,He's panicked into a standstill silence.
00:25:03,00:25:07,"And literally as they approach him, the only thing he can think to do"
00:25:07,00:25:11,"is to walk forward, put his hand out to shake and says, how do you do?"
00:25:11,00:25:12,Yes!
00:25:12,00:25:13,Yes!
00:25:13,00:25:17,And then it turned out that that was their way of greeting you by intimidating you.
00:25:17,00:25:19,It's like a great practical joke on that.
00:25:19,00:25:23,"And they came and you see the guy going, oh, and then it shakes Adamborough's hand."
00:25:23,00:25:26,But it's the most British thing I've ever seen in my life.
00:25:26,00:25:28,Literally on the brink of death.
00:25:28,00:25:30,How do you do?
00:25:30,00:25:31,It's drawn there.
00:25:31,00:25:34,"This is completely unrighteous and subject matter, but on David Attenborough."
00:25:34,00:25:39,"You know, he's the only person who's won a BAFTA in black and white colour,"
00:25:39,00:25:46,3D and HD and some other weird thing called 4X or something.
00:25:46,00:25:48,And there's 5 to 4.
00:25:48,00:25:50,That's when he's literally massaging you.
00:25:50,00:25:52,"5 formats, he's got that."
00:25:52,00:25:53,That's very cool.
00:25:53,00:25:54,It's impressive.
00:25:54,00:25:55,He's old.
00:25:55,00:25:57,So the Ashanti...
00:25:57,00:26:00,That's what I'm telling you.
00:26:00,00:26:02,That is practice.
00:26:02,00:26:05,So the Ashanti are famous for their golden stool.
00:26:05,00:26:06,Yes.
00:26:06,00:26:08,This was the throne of the Ashanti people.
00:26:08,00:26:10,It's quite small stool.
00:26:10,00:26:13,"And it's so important to them that it's never allowed to touch the ground,"
00:26:13,00:26:16,so it has its own chair.
00:26:16,00:26:19,"So it's like a stool on top of the throne, which is pretty cool."
00:26:19,00:26:20,It's not what...
00:26:20,00:26:21,Sorry.
00:26:21,00:26:25,I read that the legend comes from the fact that the golden stool started
00:26:25,00:26:28,"in the 17th century in modern-day Ghana,"
00:26:28,00:26:31,"when it came down from the heavens and landed on the king's lap,"
00:26:31,00:26:33,which seems like such a strange thing.
00:26:33,00:26:35,It's sitting on him.
00:26:35,00:26:37,That's how good it is.
00:26:37,00:26:40,It sits on you.
00:26:40,00:26:42,"But it caused the war of the golden stool, didn't it?"
00:26:42,00:26:43,That's right.
00:26:43,00:26:45,I think we caused the war of the golden stool.
00:26:45,00:26:48,"Well, some blame the stool, some blame..."
00:26:48,00:26:51,The negotiations broke down.
00:26:51,00:26:54,This was when it was classic British colonialism.
00:26:54,00:26:57,"When the governor of the Gold Coast, as it was at the time,"
00:26:57,00:26:59,"who was called Frederick Hodgson,"
00:26:59,00:27:01,"heard about this golden stool thing,"
00:27:01,00:27:03,"and demanded to be allowed to sit on it,"
00:27:03,00:27:06,"because he said, you know, the queen is your ruler."
00:27:06,00:27:07,Where is the golden stool?
00:27:07,00:27:10,Why am I not sitting on the golden stool at this moment?
00:27:10,00:27:13,I'm the representative of the paramount power in this country.
00:27:13,00:27:16,Why have you relegated me to a non-Golden stool chair?
00:27:16,00:27:18,"And so then the quote I read was,"
00:27:18,00:27:20,"""The chiefs listened in silence,"
00:27:20,00:27:22,"and then went home to prepare for war."""
00:27:22,00:27:27,(Laughter)
00:27:27,00:27:29,"Quite right, too, I think."
00:27:29,00:27:31,Yeah.
00:27:31,00:27:33,The current king of the Ashanti
00:27:33,00:27:35,"is a man called Atumfur,"
00:27:35,00:27:36,"I say, Tutu II,"
00:27:36,00:27:38,and he is qualified in accountancy
00:27:38,00:27:40,for the public administration.
00:27:40,00:27:43,Which actually is a really good thing for a king to be qualified in.
00:27:43,00:27:45,Yeah.
00:27:45,00:27:48,He studied at Killburn Polytechnic.
00:27:48,00:27:50,(Laughter)
00:27:50,00:27:51,Did he?
00:27:51,00:27:52,Yeah.
00:27:52,00:27:54,"And he has a doctorate from London Metropolitan University,"
00:27:54,00:27:57,which is where he did the public administration bit.
00:27:57,00:27:59,"I've got some Soho facts,"
00:27:59,00:28:02,but like Soho is in where we're recording tonight.
00:28:02,00:28:03,"Yeah, I've got one."
00:28:03,00:28:05,"Well, I say I've got some, I've got one."
00:28:05,00:28:07,(Laughter)
00:28:07,00:28:08,It's going to be good.
00:28:08,00:28:10,"But it's on the very street that we're on, Dean Street,"
00:28:10,00:28:12,where there's a pizza express up the road.
00:28:12,00:28:14,"And before there was the pizza express there,"
00:28:14,00:28:16,"there used to be an ear hospital,"
00:28:16,00:28:18,and it was the very first ear hospital
00:28:18,00:28:19,"in the UK,"
00:28:19,00:28:20,"something in all of Europe,"
00:28:20,00:28:21,no one had done it before.
00:28:21,00:28:23,And it was run by a guy called John Curtis.
00:28:23,00:28:25,He was a bit of a charlatan.
00:28:25,00:28:27,"He used to do this thing,"
00:28:27,00:28:30,"where he would try to convince the patient that he'd cured them,"
00:28:30,00:28:32,and made their hearing better.
00:28:32,00:28:33,"So they'd come and go,"
00:28:33,00:28:34,"""Oh, I'm having trouble hearing."""
00:28:34,00:28:38,"And then he would go, ""Okay, we'll listen to this clock."""
00:28:38,00:28:40,And he'd have a silent clock.
00:28:40,00:28:42,"And they'd be like, ""I can't hear anything."""
00:28:42,00:28:44,"And then he'd get some hot water in a syringe,"
00:28:44,00:28:45,and he would put it in their ear.
00:28:45,00:28:47,"And while they were doing that to their ear,"
00:28:47,00:28:49,"he'd get his other clock,"
00:28:49,00:28:50,which made a noise.
00:28:50,00:28:51,"He went, ""What about now?"""
00:28:51,00:28:54,"And they'd go, ""I can hear anyone. I cured you."""
00:28:54,00:28:56,They'd go off.
00:28:56,00:28:58,"But that only works for people who can actually hear,"
00:28:58,00:29:00,"who don't have hearing problems in the first place, right?"
00:29:00,00:29:01,Yeah.
00:29:01,00:29:02,Yeah.
00:29:02,00:29:03,"But apparently,"
00:29:03,00:29:05,this one ear hospital has now expanded
00:29:05,00:29:07,"into what would become great ear hospitals,"
00:29:07,00:29:09,so it actually turned into a great ear.
00:29:09,00:29:11,"Yeah, so do you mind his dubiousness?"
00:29:11,00:29:12,A little bit south of here.
00:29:12,00:29:13,"There's a nose hospital,"
00:29:13,00:29:14,"and then way further down,"
00:29:14,00:29:15,there's a throat hospital.
00:29:15,00:29:16,I'm sorry.
00:29:16,00:29:20,"So where on the Soho Theatre is 21 Dean Street,"
00:29:20,00:29:24,"and apparently Mozart played in this building,"
00:29:24,00:29:26,or in what this building was.
00:29:26,00:29:29,"Maybe a seven-year-old Mozart played the harpsichord,"
00:29:29,00:29:31,accompanied by his four-year-old system.
00:29:31,00:29:32,"Wait, a seven-year-old Mozart."
00:29:32,00:29:33,How many...
00:29:33,00:29:34,How many...
00:29:34,00:29:35,Really?
00:29:35,00:29:36,He did.
00:29:36,00:29:37,That's about it.
00:29:37,00:29:38,"Apparently, yeah."
00:29:38,00:29:39,Wow.
00:29:39,00:29:40,"Oh, yeah."
00:29:40,00:29:41,According to the websites of this very company.
00:29:41,00:29:42,Right.
00:29:42,00:29:44,"Apparently,"
00:29:44,00:29:45,Mulberry cigarettes as well.
00:29:45,00:29:48,They started selling and manufacturing cigarettes
00:29:48,00:29:49,on Great Mulberry Street.
00:29:49,00:29:50,"Oh, right."
00:29:50,00:29:52,"And Mulberry, no, no."
00:29:52,00:29:56,"It was the name, and then they removed the ""U"" at the end,"
00:29:56,00:29:59,because they thought that's not as sexy a look as a thing.
00:29:59,00:30:01,"And on top of it, they were lady cigarettes."
00:30:01,00:30:02,They weren't for men.
00:30:02,00:30:03,Wow.
00:30:03,00:30:04,"Yeah, they were..."
00:30:04,00:30:05,Mulberry.
00:30:05,00:30:06,It's not for men.
00:30:06,00:30:07,"No, genuinely."
00:30:07,00:30:08,They all started up.
00:30:08,00:30:09,They were for women.
00:30:09,00:30:12,And because it was at a point where women were encouraged
00:30:12,00:30:13,to start smoking cigarettes.
00:30:13,00:30:16,"Which, if you've ever seen an Adam Curtis documentary,"
00:30:16,00:30:17,"what was it called, ""The Power of Nightmares""?"
00:30:17,00:30:19,"It's where he shows where one person,"
00:30:19,00:30:21,"who was a grandson, I think, of Sigmund Freud,"
00:30:21,00:30:23,convinced the entire world.
00:30:23,00:30:25,Because at that point only men smoke cigarettes.
00:30:25,00:30:27,And they called them flame...
00:30:27,00:30:28,What was it?
00:30:28,00:30:29,I don't remember.
00:30:29,00:30:31,"Sticks of liberty, flames of awesomeness,"
00:30:31,00:30:34,"of some liberty, liberty tortures, or some liberty tortures,"
00:30:34,00:30:35,something like that.
00:30:35,00:30:36,So Mulberry was a...
00:30:36,00:30:37,And that was just down the road.
00:30:37,00:30:38,"Oh, cool."
00:30:38,00:30:41,And he is the man who invented Egg's and Bacon for breakfast.
00:30:41,00:30:42,"Oh, that's true."
00:30:42,00:30:43,He was the father of PR.
00:30:43,00:30:45,And the father of good health.
00:30:45,00:30:46,Yeah.
00:30:46,00:30:52,And his son invented round Egg's and Bacon.
00:30:52,00:30:53,So...
00:30:53,00:30:54,Arthur...
00:30:54,00:30:57,Um...
00:30:57,00:31:00,I think a theatre...
00:31:00,00:31:02,"The Great Wimble Theatre, in Soho,"
00:31:02,00:31:05,"was the only theatre not to close down during World War II,"
00:31:05,00:31:06,"to spot the war if it wasn't it,"
00:31:06,00:31:09,because it was an exotic dancing slash naked.
00:31:09,00:31:10,What do you call this?
00:31:10,00:31:12,It's a place where there are naked women in strip clubs.
00:31:12,00:31:13,"Sticks, please."
00:31:13,00:31:14,Yeah.
00:31:14,00:31:16,It was that.
00:31:16,00:31:18,And it was decided that it was too important
00:31:18,00:31:20,to sacrifice for the cause of war.
00:31:20,00:31:22,"So the Great Wimble Theatre, yeah."
00:31:22,00:31:24,It is no longer a strip club if you're going there.
00:31:24,00:31:25,I'm pretty sure.
00:31:25,00:31:27,I think it's just a theatre now.
00:31:27,00:31:28,Cool.
00:31:28,00:31:29,I think it is.
00:31:29,00:31:31,You think it's still a strip club?
00:31:31,00:31:32,I think so.
00:31:32,00:31:34,"Look at him, I think."
00:31:34,00:31:39,"Otherwise, I was a very avant-garde player."
00:31:39,00:31:45,"I mean, there was no plot whatsoever."
00:31:50,00:31:53,"So the start of this fact was about safe words,"
00:31:53,00:31:56,because it's something to say to make sure you don't get castrated.
00:31:56,00:31:57,And I went up...
00:31:57,00:31:59,"Which is what a safe word is, right?"
00:31:59,00:32:00,Yeah.
00:32:00,00:32:01,"Well, to be honest, I wasn't sure."
00:32:01,00:32:03,"So I went up Wikipedia, safe words."
00:32:03,00:32:07,"And they said, ""In theory, a safe word is usually a word"
00:32:07,00:32:10,"that a person would not ordinarily say during sex,"
00:32:10,00:32:14,"such as, ""Pide Apple, the Loser Raptor, or Lindsay Lowe."""
00:32:14,00:32:20,Oh my god.
00:32:20,00:32:21,Oh my god.
00:32:21,00:32:25,"And then another one, this is really great."
00:32:25,00:32:26,It's the next paragraph.
00:32:26,00:32:30,"It says, ""Since a scene may become too intense for a submissive partner"
00:32:30,00:32:33,"to remember what a safe word is, in practice,"
00:32:33,00:32:35,"commonly the word safe word is used as a safe word."""
00:32:35,00:32:36,Wow.
00:32:36,00:32:39,I'm going to have to move us on.
00:32:39,00:32:41,We've got to press on.
00:32:41,00:32:42,I know.
00:32:42,00:32:43,It's a change.
00:32:43,00:32:45,"Okay, time for our final facts of the evening."
00:32:45,00:32:46,That's my fact.
00:32:46,00:32:49,"My fact is that Matthew Ricard, the man who's labeled"
00:32:49,00:32:52,"""the happiest man in the world,"" is unhappy."
00:32:52,00:32:54,People call him that.
00:32:54,00:32:56,(Laughter)
00:32:56,00:32:57,This is by science.
00:32:57,00:32:59,They said you were the happiest man alive.
00:32:59,00:33:00,He's a Buddhist.
00:33:00,00:33:01,By science.
00:33:01,00:33:02,Sorry.
00:33:02,00:33:03,Scientists' science.
00:33:03,00:33:05,I'm hit by Captain Science.
00:33:05,00:33:08,"Basically, they were doing this massive survey"
00:33:08,00:33:09,on trying to find out about happiness.
00:33:09,00:33:12,And he was one of the people that they did these experiments
00:33:12,00:33:14,on hundreds of people.
00:33:14,00:33:19,"And he literally, they register no negativity in him whatsoever."
00:33:19,00:33:21,He just loved everything.
00:33:21,00:33:23,"Until they said, ""You're the happiest man in the world."""
00:33:23,00:33:24,"He's like, ""Fuck sake."""
00:33:24,00:33:25,(Laughter)
00:33:25,00:33:26,What's meant?
00:33:26,00:33:27,"Yeah, apparently."
00:33:27,00:33:29,"I mean, I've not read it in a proper interview with him"
00:33:29,00:33:33,that he is unhappy about it except for this book called Talk Like Ted.
00:33:33,00:33:34,It's a new book that's out.
00:33:34,00:33:38,"And in it, she says that he's really unhappy about it."
00:33:38,00:33:43,"Okay, they did this test, and they tested the happiness by a metric thing."
00:33:43,00:33:47,"So, plus 0.3 was the most miserable on this scale they had."
00:33:47,00:33:50,Minus 0.3 was meant to be extremely happy people.
00:33:50,00:33:53,And he scored minus 0.45.
00:33:53,00:33:55,Isn't that cool?
00:33:55,00:33:56,He's off the charts.
00:33:56,00:33:57,Yeah.
00:33:57,00:33:59,He said he's not the most annoying person on the planet.
00:33:59,00:34:00,(Laughter)
00:34:00,00:34:04,That is Anna plus 0.45.
00:34:04,00:34:10,(Laughter)
00:34:10,00:34:13,"He said when he was asked if he ever gets annoyed, he said,"
00:34:13,00:34:18,"""Of course I sometimes get irritated, but I usually start laughing quite quickly at the irritation"
00:34:18,00:34:22,"because it's so silly, which sounds like incredibly annoying response."""
00:34:22,00:34:25,He's surrounded by the unhappiest people in the world.
00:34:25,00:34:31,I also saw an interview with him when someone asked him about a laptop that he had stolen.
00:34:31,00:34:33,"And they said, ""Did that not make you unhappy at least?"""
00:34:33,00:34:36,"He said, ""I didn't feel aggrieved at all."
00:34:36,00:34:40,"My only regret was that he hadn't been able to send a thief the power lead."""
00:34:40,00:34:41,Bullshit.
00:34:41,00:34:42,(Laughter)
00:34:42,00:34:44,No one can be that happy.
00:34:44,00:34:47,"It's impossible, but he's like a Buddhist guy, right?"
00:34:47,00:34:50,He says meditation is the main thing.
00:34:50,00:34:52,"He's the Dalai Lama's right hand man, I believe."
00:34:52,00:34:53,"Oh, yeah, really?"
00:34:53,00:34:57,"I saw an interview where they talked about the Dalai Lama and someone asked him,"
00:34:57,00:34:59,"""Does he watch the Marx brothers?"
00:34:59,00:35:01,"Does the Dalai Lama watch the Marx brothers?"""
00:35:01,00:35:04,"And this guy, Rikar, said, ""He doesn't have to."
00:35:04,00:35:06,"His life is so full of humour."""
00:35:06,00:35:08,"Although I think he used to watch ""Mash."""
00:35:08,00:35:10,(Laughter)
00:35:10,00:35:11,That's TV show ever.
00:35:11,00:35:13,"Yeah, well, that's the Dalai Lama."
00:35:13,00:35:15,That doesn't think it's that funny.
00:35:15,00:35:19,"There's a good so, as we say, Buddhism is a thing that really focuses on a thing."
00:35:19,00:35:22,"A religion that really focuses on China, a chief happiness."
00:35:22,00:35:24,"And in Bhutan, obviously, a Buddhist country."
00:35:24,00:35:29,All new government policies have to have a growth national happiness assessment.
00:35:29,00:35:32,"So every policy that's made has to be run through the,"
00:35:32,00:35:35,"""Is this going to cause growth national happiness rings?"""
00:35:35,00:35:37,"In order to establish, which is so cool."
00:35:37,00:35:38,And so they're really happy country.
00:35:38,00:35:40,They're one of the poorest countries in the world.
00:35:40,00:35:43,"And yet, they're about number eight on the global happiness index."
00:35:43,00:35:44,Number eight.
00:35:44,00:35:48,"I think they're about, there are so many lists of the happiest countries in the world."
00:35:48,00:35:50,"Usually it's Costa Rica, number one, isn't it?"
00:35:50,00:35:51,"Denmark, usually, I think."
00:35:51,00:35:53,But Panama recently overtook them.
00:35:53,00:35:55,"Today, you've been to Bhutan."
00:35:55,00:35:56,I have.
00:35:56,00:35:59,Nice.
00:35:59,00:36:02,They're just all so bloody happy.
00:36:02,00:36:06,Do they announce the happiest country at an actual award ceremony?
00:36:06,00:36:10,Because I'd love to see the camera pan across everyone's face.
00:36:10,00:36:14,When they point out it's not there.
00:36:14,00:36:17,"Bhutan, I think they're so happy because they have a dragon king."
00:36:17,00:36:20,How will happy would be if we called our queen the dragon queen?
00:36:20,00:36:22,That's what they call them.
00:36:22,00:36:24,He actually went to school in England as well.
00:36:24,00:36:27,"Yes, Gilbert Polytechnic."
00:36:27,00:36:31,He's called Wangchuk.
00:36:31,00:36:32,He is?
00:36:32,00:36:33,Yeah.
00:36:33,00:36:35,You've been funny about that?
00:36:35,00:36:38,And he's the last in the Wangchuk dynasty so far.
00:36:38,00:36:40,There's been like four or five Wangchuk.
00:36:40,00:36:44,He's not been able to find anyone to take his name.
00:36:44,00:36:46,He's got seven sons.
00:36:46,00:36:47,All of them.
00:36:47,00:36:50,"No, I'm Smith."
00:36:50,00:36:53,"Also, Bhutan has no traffic lights, does it?"
00:36:53,00:36:56,Which may be the happiest country in the world.
00:36:56,00:36:58,It's the traffic lights and the dragon king thing.
00:36:58,00:37:00,And they pledge to be a carbon sink forever.
00:37:00,00:37:01,Yeah.
00:37:01,00:37:03,So be a net absorber of carbon.
00:37:03,00:37:07,They did use to have one traffic lights in the centre of Timpoot.
00:37:07,00:37:10,"It's near the golf course, if you want to know where."
00:37:10,00:37:12,"You've been, you've been, haven't you?"
00:37:12,00:37:13,"I play golf there, yeah."
00:37:13,00:37:19,But the place where they put the traffic lights there and everyone got so upset by the traffic lights.
00:37:19,00:37:22,They got rid of them and now there's just a guy there the whole time who's doing the job of the traffic lights.
00:37:22,00:37:24,Because they thought it was too impersonal.
00:37:24,00:37:25,Yeah.
00:37:25,00:37:26,"Because they're so happy, happy."
00:37:26,00:37:30,They need a human to be doing their traffic lighting for them.
00:37:30,00:37:33,"I've done karaoke in Bhutan as well, actually, with a load of monks."
00:37:33,00:37:34,No.
00:37:34,00:37:35,Wow.
00:37:35,00:37:36,That's another story.
00:37:36,00:37:37,What is it?
00:37:37,00:37:38,No.
00:37:38,00:37:40,"You don't get on the hook very easily, yeah."
00:37:40,00:37:41,What did you sing?
00:37:41,00:37:42,I can't remember.
00:37:42,00:37:45,"It was some, like, I think I sang some Bhutanese."
00:37:45,00:37:48,Because I'm happy coming.
00:37:48,00:37:50,"That's, yeah, that's all they sing for Elle William."
00:37:50,00:37:52,Yeah.
00:37:52,00:37:53,Keep the points up.
00:37:53,00:37:55,"Look, it's coming down."
00:37:55,00:37:57,That's the rick as I heard.
00:37:57,00:37:58,Come on.
00:37:58,00:37:59,"Oh, it's working."
00:37:59,00:38:00,Come on.
00:38:00,00:38:09,"Supposedly, but as teaching, there are 84,000 negative emotions."
00:38:09,00:38:10,Really?
00:38:10,00:38:11,Yeah.
00:38:11,00:38:17,"And there are also, there are 87,000 drinks combinations at Starbucks."
00:38:17,00:38:18,Coincidence?
00:38:18,00:38:19,It can't be.
00:38:19,00:38:20,Perfect.
00:38:20,00:38:26,"That's like, how many different types of smile are there?"
00:38:26,00:38:29,There are something like 18 different types of smile on there.
00:38:29,00:38:33,"And there's only one of those 18 that makes, that is a genuine smile of happiness."
00:38:33,00:38:34,I'm sorry.
00:38:34,00:38:35,"I have to share the smile, right?"
00:38:35,00:38:36,Yeah.
00:38:36,00:38:37,The mouth smile.
00:38:37,00:38:38,I'm out.
00:38:38,00:38:41,There's a Pan American smile.
00:38:41,00:38:42,Yeah.
00:38:42,00:38:46,And that was air hostesses from back in the '50s.
00:38:46,00:38:48,"Just fake, fake with the mouth only."
00:38:48,00:38:49,Yeah.
00:38:49,00:38:51,"But it became, it was such a big thing, wasn't it?"
00:38:51,00:38:56,"It was the classic, on the side of planes, they would have the classic air hostesses of the '50s look."
00:38:56,00:38:58,And it was the fake smile.
00:38:58,00:38:59,Yeah.
00:38:59,00:39:00,I don't know if that's one of the 19 or 18.
00:39:00,00:39:01,"Hey, almost certainly."
00:39:01,00:39:02,I think it is.
00:39:02,00:39:03,And the best one is the Duchenne smile.
00:39:03,00:39:06,And that's one you can tell by the eyes because it's the wrinkles around the eyes.
00:39:06,00:39:08,"Like, you know, there's a real smile."
00:39:08,00:39:09,And that's probably why.
00:39:09,00:39:13,"So there are a lot, there's a lot of data about how the older you get the happier you get."
00:39:13,00:39:15,And it's just because people have got wrinkled eyes when they're older.
00:39:15,00:39:20,Because it is the happiness index goes up and like right into your '80s.
00:39:20,00:39:22,But it goes down until you're mid-40s.
00:39:22,00:39:23,"Yes, it does."
00:39:23,00:39:24,Because that's the least happy.
00:39:24,00:39:26,"And then from then on, it's all upwards."
00:39:26,00:39:29,Which means the graph looks a bit like a smile.
00:39:29,00:39:36,"All right, Mathieu Ricard."
00:39:36,00:39:41,"Oh, by the way, Mathieu Ricard has on his website."
00:39:41,00:39:42,Did you guys look on his website?
00:39:42,00:39:45,His website has a few features.
00:39:45,00:39:48,My favorite feature is smile of the week.
00:39:48,00:39:51,And it's just a different monk every week.
00:39:51,00:39:53,It's having a good old smile.
00:39:53,00:39:55,It's actually really nice to look at.
00:39:55,00:39:58,"If he's not happy about the happy thing, he's bringing on himself."
00:39:58,00:40:01,"If he's doing a smile of the week website, I think."
00:40:01,00:40:02,Yeah.
00:40:02,00:40:04,He's been celibate since he was 30.
00:40:04,00:40:11,He has a little counter on his website.
00:40:11,00:40:15,[LAUGHTER]
00:40:15,00:40:19,"Do Shen used to, as well as discovering the one smile that is a true smile,"
00:40:19,00:40:22,"he's the electrocute, different men to people's faces to create different expressions."
00:40:22,00:40:24,Didn't need to work out what different expressions meant.
00:40:24,00:40:25,And it's so funny.
00:40:25,00:40:28,"And because it was in, it was the mid to late 19th century."
00:40:28,00:40:30,Because it was the age of photography as well.
00:40:30,00:40:31,He combined the two.
00:40:31,00:40:35,And he just took loads of photos of these patients making mental expressions.
00:40:35,00:40:36,Because he was electrocuting them.
00:40:36,00:40:37,These people were going like.
00:40:37,00:40:39,[LAUGHTER]
00:40:39,00:40:40,"Yeah, it's kind of mean."
00:40:40,00:40:41,That's kind of mean.
00:40:41,00:40:42,Yeah.
00:40:42,00:40:44,I just got a flash.
00:40:44,00:40:45,We're going to have to wrap up.
00:40:45,00:40:46,That man.
00:40:46,00:40:48,"Yeah, that's what that was."
00:40:48,00:40:51,Do we have any final facts that you want to chuck in?
00:40:51,00:40:52,OK.
00:40:52,00:40:55,"Well, Hitachi has come up with a happiness algorithm."
00:40:55,00:40:58,You put a badge on your shirt.
00:40:58,00:41:01,"And there's an accelerometer on there, which measures your activity."
00:41:01,00:41:06,And it means that the boss of a company can tell how happy everyone is in the company.
00:41:06,00:41:08,I can adjust things accordingly.
00:41:08,00:41:11,"Oh, Brave New World."
00:41:11,00:41:12,Yeah.
00:41:12,00:41:17,"I got one last thing, which is that I was looking into just when I was doing the research."
00:41:17,00:41:21,"I thought, science has labeled this person the something in the world."
00:41:21,00:41:22,"Oh, yeah."
00:41:22,00:41:25,"And I only had one thing come up, which was the man with the largest penis."
00:41:25,00:41:26,"Oh, yeah."
00:41:26,00:41:27,I know.
00:41:27,00:41:28,"Well, I don't know him."
00:41:28,00:41:31,[LAUGHTER]
00:41:31,00:41:32,It was just one night.
00:41:32,00:41:33,I know.
00:41:33,00:41:37,"James, your eyes are watering."
00:41:37,00:41:39,[LAUGHTER]
00:41:39,00:41:42,"No, he works as a data entry clerk in America, doesn't he?"
00:41:42,00:41:43,I think.
00:41:43,00:41:43,Yeah.
00:41:43,00:41:44,Yeah.
00:41:44,00:41:46,"Well, is he using to enter the data?"
00:41:46,00:41:50,[LAUGHTER]
00:41:50,00:41:52,"All right, we don't even have time for the fact."
00:41:52,00:41:53,That's it.
