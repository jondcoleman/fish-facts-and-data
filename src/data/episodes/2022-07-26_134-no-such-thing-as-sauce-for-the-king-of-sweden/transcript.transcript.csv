00:00:00,00:00:02,"Hi guys, just before we start this episode,"
00:00:02,00:00:04,"just to let you know, we will be recording"
00:00:04,00:00:07,the first episode of series two of no such things
00:00:07,00:00:08,the news next week.
00:00:08,00:00:10,And we're recording that live on Tuesday.
00:00:10,00:00:13,"And for the middle section of the TV show,"
00:00:13,00:00:15,we would like to use the most interesting facts
00:00:15,00:00:18,"that you guys, our audience, has learned from the news"
00:00:18,00:00:20,over the past seven days.
00:00:20,00:00:22,"So if you've seen anything interesting in the news,"
00:00:22,00:00:25,"tweet it to @QIPodcast, email podcast@QI.com"
00:00:25,00:00:29,or post it up on the no such things a fish Facebook page.
00:00:29,00:00:32,And we'll pick our favorites and news in the middle of the show.
00:00:32,00:00:33,"OK, hope you enjoyed this show, which"
00:00:33,00:00:36,is a recording of the dummy run for no such things
00:00:36,00:00:39,the news that we did live last week on with the show.
00:00:39,00:00:42,[MUSIC PLAYING]
00:00:42,00:00:57,"Now, hello, and welcome to another episode"
00:00:57,00:00:59,of no such thing as the news coming
00:00:59,00:01:01,"to you from Up the Creek in Greenwich, London."
00:01:01,00:01:03,"My name is Dan Shriver, and I'm sitting here"
00:01:03,00:01:07,"with Anna Chazinski, Andrew Hunter Murray, and James Harkin."
00:01:07,00:01:11,[APPLAUSE]
00:01:11,00:01:14,"Once again, we're here to present the most interesting stories"
00:01:14,00:01:16,we found in the news of the last seven days.
00:01:16,00:01:21,"And in no particular order, here we go, starting with you, Chazinski."
00:01:21,00:01:24,My fact this week is that one of these stalls
00:01:24,00:01:27,at the Conservative Party conference this week
00:01:27,00:01:28,is a grounds shooting simulator.
00:01:28,00:01:31,[LAUGHTER]
00:01:31,00:01:35,Sort of normal ordinary things as struggling families.
00:01:35,00:01:36,"So this is in the mirror, in fact."
00:01:36,00:01:39,So a mirror journalist went around the Conservative Party
00:01:39,00:01:40,conference and made a list of the most
00:01:40,00:01:43,Tory things at the Tory conference.
00:01:43,00:01:45,And that unsurprisingly made the list.
00:01:45,00:01:48,"Well, the grass simulator, you obviously"
00:01:48,00:01:49,saw what it looks like.
00:01:49,00:01:52,"It's like a little thing that you attach on this kind of fake gun,"
00:01:52,00:01:56,but you can attach it on your own gun if you want to.
00:01:56,00:01:58,It's so inclined.
00:01:58,00:02:01,"How many people at the Conservative conference went,"
00:02:01,00:02:03,"""Oh, actually, I've brought my own gun."""
00:02:03,00:02:05,"And actually, there's a lady called"
00:02:05,00:02:08,"Danka Batekeva, who's Slovakian, who"
00:02:08,00:02:10,used this grounds simulator when she was training
00:02:10,00:02:11,for the London Olympics.
00:02:11,00:02:14,And she won a medal at the London Olympics.
00:02:14,00:02:15,Really?
00:02:15,00:02:17,"Oh, cool."
00:02:17,00:02:19,"So it's a useful and interesting thing,"
00:02:19,00:02:21,and not just chance for landowners
00:02:21,00:02:24,to show off their shooting prowess.
00:02:24,00:02:27,"I have to say, reading about the Tory party conference,"
00:02:27,00:02:30,I just thought it looks so fun.
00:02:30,00:02:33,"I know, politically, you could sit on either side,"
00:02:33,00:02:35,"but as an event, it looks so much fun."
00:02:35,00:02:36,"And I went on Twitter and I thought,"
00:02:36,00:02:38,"I wonder if people are tweeting about this saying,"
00:02:38,00:02:39,this is really fun.
00:02:39,00:02:40,And they were.
00:02:40,00:02:41,So many people were just--
00:02:41,00:02:44,because it was a hashtag CPC16.
00:02:44,00:02:47,And I put CPC16 fun.
00:02:47,00:02:49,And it just came up with all these tweets going.
00:02:49,00:02:53,"If you search CPC16 crap, you would have got a lot of these."
00:02:53,00:02:57,"Well, I search CPC16 boring."
00:02:57,00:03:00,"And actually, today, there was a lot of boring stuff going on,"
00:03:00,00:03:01,mainly about Hammond speech.
00:03:01,00:03:03,I don't know if you heard about Hammond speech.
00:03:03,00:03:05,"So there were a few tweets, I saved."
00:03:05,00:03:07,"One that said, Hammond so boring, TFL"
00:03:07,00:03:10,wants to use him on the tunnels for the London Crossrail.
00:03:10,00:03:11,Project.
00:03:11,00:03:12,Good.
00:03:12,00:03:13,"And then on the fun side, because there"
00:03:13,00:03:14,were lots of fun tweets.
00:03:14,00:03:16,"This guy said, fucking hell."
00:03:16,00:03:18,"It's 1/3 in the morning, and I'm listening to two men"
00:03:18,00:03:21,arguing about the Turnstile Act of 1963.
00:03:21,00:03:23,And the CPC16 is so fun at eggs.
00:03:23,00:03:27,[LAUGHTER]
00:03:27,00:03:28,I think you might be missing a note of sarcasm
00:03:28,00:03:30,because that was his speech.
00:03:30,00:03:33,"I am here to tell you, having been to party conference"
00:03:33,00:03:35,"or two, that they are all lying."
00:03:35,00:03:38,The people who want to be promoted within the Tory party
00:03:38,00:03:40,"are going, so it is not in their interest to go,"
00:03:40,00:03:42,"this is a fucking waste of time, isn't it?"
00:03:42,00:03:45,"I think they have to say, I'm having the time of my lying."
00:03:45,00:03:47,"I don't know, because there was an owl"
00:03:47,00:03:48,that you could hold on your arm.
00:03:48,00:03:50,[LAUGHTER]
00:03:50,00:03:52,It's a real owl.
00:03:52,00:03:52,It's a real owl.
00:03:52,00:03:54,"Unfortunately, a lot of Tories brought their own guns,"
00:03:54,00:03:56,and that owl didn't like that.
00:03:56,00:03:57,It wasn't mixed up.
00:03:57,00:04:00,They shouldn't put those two things next to each other.
00:04:00,00:04:02,"One person, I'm not sure he was having a great time,"
00:04:02,00:04:04,"is Camden Councillor Johnny Bucknell,"
00:04:04,00:04:07,who spent the conference sleeping in his car.
00:04:07,00:04:10,"And what he thinks is, these conferences shouldn't"
00:04:10,00:04:12,"be held in big cities, where all the hotels are really"
00:04:12,00:04:13,expensive.
00:04:13,00:04:14,"They should be held in like Blackpool,"
00:04:14,00:04:16,where it's £10 a night or something.
00:04:16,00:04:18,That's what he said.
00:04:18,00:04:20,And so I looked at the other things that he's
00:04:20,00:04:21,done in the last year or so.
00:04:21,00:04:23,And this is all that's in the news about him.
00:04:23,00:04:27,"He was £30,000 for being a Shiny landlord."
00:04:27,00:04:29,And he was told off for eating roast duck
00:04:29,00:04:36,"during a town hall meeting, after which he vowed to campaign"
00:04:36,00:04:38,for the right to have a roast meal during meetings.
00:04:38,00:04:42,[LAUGHTER]
00:04:42,00:04:44,Do you know what you could get at the Lib Dem conference?
00:04:44,00:04:45,This year.
00:04:45,00:04:46,There's another bit of murder.
00:04:46,00:04:47,A seat?
00:04:47,00:04:50,[LAUGHTER]
00:04:50,00:04:54,[APPLAUSE]
00:04:54,00:04:55,I think you'll find James seats are the one thing.
00:04:55,00:04:57,The Lib Dem conference's struggling way.
00:04:57,00:04:59,[LAUGHTER]
00:04:59,00:05:04,"No, they also have--"
00:05:04,00:05:05,"I mean, all the party conferences are there in March."
00:05:05,00:05:08,"But the Lib Dem conference, you can get branded"
00:05:08,00:05:10,"18th birthday cards, Lib Dem themed,"
00:05:10,00:05:17,"in a pack of 50, for someone who has 50,"
00:05:17,00:05:20,young nephews or nieces.
00:05:20,00:05:20,"Don't worry, darling."
00:05:20,00:05:22,You can sell them to pay off your student loan.
00:05:22,00:05:25,[LAUGHTER]
00:05:25,00:05:28,"It was the Looney conference this week,"
00:05:28,00:05:31,"earlier this week, for the Monster Raven Looney party."
00:05:31,00:05:36,"They held it in Blackpool, Uncle Tom's cabin pub."
00:05:36,00:05:38,"And I went on the website, and they"
00:05:38,00:05:40,had a whole load of things that was going to happen there.
00:05:40,00:05:43,"And they said, very sorry to say that Vince Cornwall"
00:05:43,00:05:46,and his rodent rap show will not be appearing this year.
00:05:46,00:05:48,[LAUGHTER]
00:05:48,00:05:51,"Vince has had surgery and been told to take it easy,"
00:05:51,00:05:54,"although he is open about, I will be attending with Andrew"
00:05:54,00:05:55,the Rat.
00:05:55,00:05:59,[LAUGHTER]
00:05:59,00:06:01,"There was an incident at the UKIP party conference,"
00:06:01,00:06:03,which was in September.
00:06:03,00:06:05,One of the failed leadership candidates
00:06:05,00:06:06,called Lisa Duffy went out for dinner.
00:06:06,00:06:08,The conference was in Bournemouth.
00:06:08,00:06:11,And the place was raided by immigration officials
00:06:11,00:06:14,who wanted to check the visa status of the people working
00:06:14,00:06:15,in the restaurant.
00:06:15,00:06:18,"And apparently, the chef she said ran away into the night."
00:06:18,00:06:20,"So she said, watching our chef running away into the night"
00:06:20,00:06:24,is apron flapping in the wind with a surreal moment.
00:06:24,00:06:26,"Turned out, they were all completely legally working in the UK."
00:06:26,00:06:28,So I have no idea why he ran away.
00:06:28,00:06:30,[LAUGHTER]
00:06:30,00:06:33,Could be the idea of having to serve a whole bunch of UKIP candidates
00:06:33,00:06:35,at the end of the day.
00:06:35,00:06:38,[LAUGHTER]
00:06:38,00:06:40,The journalists and politicians
00:06:40,00:06:42,have a football match at every Labour and Tory party
00:06:42,00:06:44,"conference, which I didn't realise."
00:06:44,00:06:48,"So this year, the lobby 11, which is the team of journalists,"
00:06:48,00:06:50,played the Tory MPs.
00:06:50,00:06:52,And a Tory's lost five to this year.
00:06:52,00:06:54,"In 2014, they lost seven to."
00:06:54,00:06:56,That's because they're all on the right wing.
00:06:56,00:06:57,[LAUGHTER]
00:06:57,00:07:02,Another thing that's been in the news
00:07:02,00:07:06,and is related to football this week is the Hungarian referendum.
00:07:06,00:07:09,So this is a referendum as to whether Hungary wants
00:07:09,00:07:11,to allow the EU to force that they take in.
00:07:11,00:07:15,"Only another 1,300, I think, asylum seekers."
00:07:15,00:07:16,And they voted against it.
00:07:16,00:07:19,"But the Prime Minister of Hungary, Victor Orban,"
00:07:19,00:07:21,"who brought this referendum, is a former footballer,"
00:07:21,00:07:26,and he features in the 2006 edition of Football Manager.
00:07:26,00:07:28,"So if anyone has that, he's there."
00:07:28,00:07:31,He plays for Feltzut FC.
00:07:31,00:07:34,"He-- yeah, yeah."
00:07:34,00:07:37,"Speaking of games and also simulators,"
00:07:37,00:07:41,the top app at the moment is a simulator.
00:07:41,00:07:44,"This is PewDiePie's YouTuber simulator,"
00:07:44,00:07:47,where you get to pretend to be a YouTuber.
00:07:47,00:07:48,It's a great game.
00:07:48,00:07:51,"What, so do you-- you wear a simulator"
00:07:51,00:07:54,"and you're just looking into a camera and going,"
00:07:54,00:07:56,"oh, my life's so crazy, I just--"
00:07:56,00:08:00,"Amazingly, it's even more boring than that."
00:08:00,00:08:01,"You're a character on your phone,"
00:08:01,00:08:03,"and you're in your bedroom with a computer,"
00:08:03,00:08:06,and you have to make videos.
00:08:06,00:08:07,You don't get to really make videos.
00:08:07,00:08:10,You just get to pretend to make videos.
00:08:10,00:08:12,"And then they get views, and you get money for that,"
00:08:12,00:08:16,and you can buy more things to decorate your bedroom with.
00:08:16,00:08:17,Your fake bedroom?
00:08:17,00:08:18,"Your fake bedroom, yeah."
00:08:18,00:08:22,"I played it this morning, which is why my research"
00:08:22,00:08:25,is a bit kind of short this week.
00:08:25,00:08:26,"No, I made a video."
00:08:26,00:08:29,"It got 13 views and three subscribers,"
00:08:29,00:08:32,and it got me enough money to buy a cardboard box.
00:08:32,00:08:34,It was quite in my bedroom.
00:08:34,00:08:36,"And then I had to wait for it to get delivered,"
00:08:36,00:08:39,"and it certainly would take 30 seconds, and my app crashed,"
00:08:39,00:08:41,and it took me three minutes.
00:08:41,00:08:44,"And then I just got bored, and I stopped playing."
00:08:44,00:08:46,And this app is made by the same people
00:08:46,00:08:53,"who made goats simulator, a game in which players can drag things,"
00:08:53,00:08:57,"wiggle things, throw things, and lick things."
00:08:57,00:09:01,I think it needs to be specifying what thing.
00:09:01,00:09:04,"There's a new virtual reality simulator out as well,"
00:09:04,00:09:05,so you put it on your head.
00:09:05,00:09:09,"And what it is, the game is your lonely cow"
00:09:09,00:09:10,in a field.
00:09:10,00:09:12,"Yeah, genuinely."
00:09:12,00:09:13,And there's no other cows.
00:09:13,00:09:19,"And people come, and they taser you, and force you into a truck."
00:09:19,00:09:21,And it's meant to raise awareness about how cows
00:09:21,00:09:24,are being treated in the world today.
00:09:24,00:09:25,It doesn't sound that fun.
00:09:25,00:09:26,Does it now? I say that now.
00:09:26,00:09:28,"Well, the pictures look amazing, because you're on all fours,"
00:09:28,00:09:30,"and you're just walking around your living room,"
00:09:30,00:09:35,"occasionally going, oh, when you're tasered."
00:09:35,00:09:39,"And there's another one where you can be a piece of coral,"
00:09:39,00:09:42,"it's another virtual reality simulator, and you sit,"
00:09:42,00:09:46,"and you're a piece of coral, and you watch the reef decay"
00:09:46,00:09:49,from acids that are let into the water.
00:09:49,00:09:51,The one thing I know about coral is they get
00:09:51,00:09:53,most of their nutrients from urine.
00:09:53,00:09:55,They get it from fish urine.
00:09:55,00:09:59,So parents don't buy this game for your children.
00:09:59,00:10:01,"We need to move on in a sex, or an X-Fact."
00:10:01,00:10:04,"Anything before we do? Just back to politics, one thing."
00:10:04,00:10:09,"So there's been an election in Brazil for the mayor of Sao Paulo,"
00:10:09,00:10:12,and the man who has won is the host
00:10:12,00:10:14,of the Brazilian version of the apprentice.
00:10:14,00:10:16,"Oh, oh! Oh!"
00:10:16,00:10:18,Yeah. I know.
00:10:18,00:10:22,What are the chances it'll happen twice in one day?
00:10:22,00:10:27,"OK, it is time for fact number two, and that is Andy."
00:10:27,00:10:29,My fact is that comets sound like a cross
00:10:29,00:10:32,between a cat and a dolphin.
00:10:32,00:10:33,Yeah.
00:10:33,00:10:34,You mean the noise that they make?
00:10:34,00:10:35,"I mean, the noise they make."
00:10:35,00:10:40,"So this week, the comets 67P Churuyumov-Garassimenko,"
00:10:40,00:10:44,the Rosetta satellite has the probe.
00:10:44,00:10:45,We call it a probe.
00:10:45,00:10:47,Probe? Probe.
00:10:47,00:10:49,[LAUGHTER]
00:10:49,00:10:51,"It's weird when people shout ""probe"" at you."
00:10:51,00:10:54,[LAUGHTER]
00:10:54,00:10:56,"I'm used to it. OK, go."
00:10:56,00:10:57,[LAUGHTER]
00:10:57,00:11:00,So they've gathered so much data from this comet
00:11:00,00:11:02,"that they never had before, and one of the things they found"
00:11:02,00:11:04,"is it gives us this low-frequency hum,"
00:11:04,00:11:05,and they're not exactly clear why it might be
00:11:05,00:11:09,because it has charged particles in the gas and the dust jets
00:11:09,00:11:12,"that it gives out, and I think we can play it."
00:11:12,00:11:14,"This is a sped up version of it, because it's normally"
00:11:14,00:11:15,above the range.
00:11:15,00:11:19,[PHONE RINGING]
00:11:19,00:11:21,That's kind of dolphin-ing?
00:11:21,00:11:22,I hear the dolphin.
00:11:22,00:11:23,Yeah.
00:11:23,00:11:25,"Imagine it, but more like a cat."
00:11:25,00:11:27,[LAUGHTER]
00:11:27,00:11:28,Imagine pressing it together.
00:11:28,00:11:29,It sounds like a cat purring a bit.
00:11:29,00:11:31,"Anyway, that's the noise it makes."
00:11:31,00:11:32,I think it does sound like a cat purring.
00:11:32,00:11:34,"Yeah, more than a dolphin, in fact."
00:11:34,00:11:35,"But that is very sped up, isn't it?"
00:11:35,00:11:38,"So actually, it's like one of those noises every 20 minutes"
00:11:38,00:11:41,"or something, the dolphin that clicks very infrequently."
00:11:41,00:11:44,And have we had to manufacture that sound?
00:11:44,00:11:46,"Because it doesn't quite-- we can't send sound back,"
00:11:46,00:11:48,so they're picking up signals of what the sound should be
00:11:48,00:11:49,generating.
00:11:49,00:11:51,That's a recreation.
00:11:51,00:11:53,That's someone in a-- that's like in TV
00:11:53,00:11:55,when you have to make boot sounds on the ground.
00:11:55,00:11:56,They're trying to do what?
00:11:56,00:11:57,Comet.
00:11:57,00:11:59,"Oh, and that's-- that's another--"
00:11:59,00:12:00,"Get me a dolphin, yeah."
00:12:00,00:12:02,[LAUGHTER]
00:12:02,00:12:04,[INAUDIBLE]
00:12:04,00:12:05,It's not quite that.
00:12:05,00:12:07,They've copied and pasted the vibrations
00:12:07,00:12:10,that are being emitted by the comet into radio waves
00:12:10,00:12:12,so that we can hear them.
00:12:12,00:12:14,They haven't just hired a cat.
00:12:14,00:12:15,[LAUGHTER]
00:12:15,00:12:18,"Actually, doesn't it smell like cat pee?"
00:12:18,00:12:19,"Yeah, it smells like cat pee."
00:12:19,00:12:21,And it looks like a duck.
00:12:21,00:12:25,I'm wondering if this is a comet or something.
00:12:25,00:12:27,"If it looks like a duck, sounds like a dolphin"
00:12:27,00:12:29,and a cat and smells like cat urine.
00:12:29,00:12:34,It's Comet's 67P. Do you know we don't know if it changed?
00:12:34,00:12:35,"It's tuned, though."
00:12:35,00:12:37,And so-- [LAUGHTER]
00:12:37,00:12:39,"So, Halley's Comet has been studied before,"
00:12:39,00:12:40,and it makes a completely different thing
00:12:40,00:12:43,as a completely different song when it gets closer to the sun.
00:12:43,00:12:45,And so we're still waiting on the dates to come back
00:12:45,00:12:49,as to whether the tune now sounds more like a duck or a giraffe
00:12:49,00:12:51,or whatever weird.
00:12:51,00:12:52,And we want to compare it to--
00:12:52,00:12:54,"Hey, speaking of Halley's Comet, do you"
00:12:54,00:12:56,know when the next time we're going to see Halley's Comet is?
00:12:56,00:12:59,"Oh, well, the last one was when probably when I was a teenager,"
00:12:59,00:13:04,"so it'll be another probably 45s, 0.6 years,"
00:13:04,00:13:05,something like that.
00:13:05,00:13:06,October 20th.
00:13:06,00:13:07,Oh.
00:13:07,00:13:08,Yeah.
00:13:08,00:13:10,[LAUGHTER]
00:13:10,00:13:16,And I'm older than I think.
00:13:16,00:13:21,"No, I've just got the word hubris in my notes here."
00:13:21,00:13:24,You could send me 50 birthday cards.
00:13:24,00:13:27,"I hope you liked him, found him."
00:13:27,00:13:29,[LAUGHTER]
00:13:29,00:13:32,"Now, what this is is that Halley's Comet, when it flies by,"
00:13:32,00:13:35,it obviously leaves a trail behind it.
00:13:35,00:13:37,"And so on October 20th, we're going to come into the path"
00:13:37,00:13:40,of the debris trail that it left behind when we saw it.
00:13:40,00:13:43,"And so, if you're in the north of Wales, October 20th,"
00:13:43,00:13:46,"and it lasts for quite a long time because it's a long trail,"
00:13:46,00:13:48,you'll see meteor showers coming in.
00:13:48,00:13:50,And you'll be able to watch the debris of Halley's Comet
00:13:50,00:13:53,"coming in, and it happens every year."
00:13:53,00:13:54,That is great.
00:13:54,00:13:55,I don't know if it counts as seeing a comet
00:13:55,00:13:58,if you're seeing what it's excreted as it's possible.
00:13:58,00:14:01,It's walking into a room two years after someone faster than it.
00:14:01,00:14:03,[LAUGHTER]
00:14:03,00:14:05,"Terry, hi."
00:14:05,00:14:06,[LAUGHTER]
00:14:06,00:14:10,"So this thing, with just back to the comet quickly,"
00:14:10,00:14:12,they've discovered a lot of stuff.
00:14:12,00:14:15,"So, for example, they discovered a new kind of carbon,"
00:14:15,00:14:17,"which was really complicated, not like the kind of carbon"
00:14:17,00:14:18,that we're made of.
00:14:18,00:14:20,And there was an interview with a team member
00:14:20,00:14:23,"of Resetta, a good Evie cotton."
00:14:23,00:14:25,"He said, ""It is so complex."
00:14:25,00:14:28,"We can't give it a proper formula or a name."""
00:14:28,00:14:30,[LAUGHTER]
00:14:30,00:14:31,It's so complex.
00:14:31,00:14:33,[LAUGHTER]
00:14:33,00:14:35,They don't even need it.
00:14:35,00:14:37,Do they keep trying?
00:14:37,00:14:37,"They're like, we'll call it--"
00:14:37,00:14:40,[LAUGHTER]
00:14:40,00:14:43,[INAUDIBLE]
00:14:43,00:14:46,And have we said why this is in the news this week?
00:14:46,00:14:50,"Rosetta, which is the probe, which went around the comet,"
00:14:50,00:14:53,"it's crashed into the comet and it's the end of its life, isn't it?"
00:14:53,00:14:55,It's not actually the end of its life.
00:14:55,00:14:57,It's just cuss off its phone conversation with us.
00:14:57,00:14:58,Yeah.
00:14:58,00:15:01,It's kind of heubristic of us to assume that it's not dead.
00:15:01,00:15:02,"Well, that's true."
00:15:02,00:15:04,"But you see, because it's like solar power, isn't it?"
00:15:04,00:15:08,"So they were thinking, well, maybe we could just kind of land"
00:15:08,00:15:10,"it softly, and then next time it goes near the sun,"
00:15:10,00:15:12,it can power up again.
00:15:12,00:15:14,"Well, they weren't sure if that was going to work."
00:15:14,00:15:17,"And then so one of the scientists at the ESA, Matt Taylor,"
00:15:17,00:15:22,said they'd rather go out in true rock and roll style
00:15:22,00:15:23,and crash into the comet.
00:15:23,00:15:26,It's weird that he said that because they crashed into the comet
00:15:26,00:15:27,two miles an hour.
00:15:27,00:15:29,[LAUGHTER]
00:15:29,00:15:30,That's walking pace.
00:15:30,00:15:31,That is walking pace.
00:15:31,00:15:34,It's rolled into a comet.
00:15:34,00:15:37,The most interesting thing for me about the whole thing
00:15:37,00:15:40,is that we did find out amazing information
00:15:40,00:15:42,about the makeup of comets and so on.
00:15:42,00:15:44,And they think that there might be bits of it
00:15:44,00:15:48,that suggest how life may have arrived on Earth.
00:15:48,00:15:50,"But for me, what's really interesting"
00:15:50,00:15:52,"is on the actual probe risetta,"
00:15:52,00:15:55,they included a thing called the risetta disk.
00:15:55,00:15:57,I don't know if you remember Voyager years and years ago
00:15:57,00:16:01,had a golden disk on it that had songs from Earth languages.
00:16:01,00:16:02,"Yeah, it's languages."
00:16:02,00:16:04,Exactly.
00:16:04,00:16:08,So they've created a 7.5-centimeter nickel disk
00:16:08,00:16:10,"that has 1,000 languages on it."
00:16:10,00:16:14,"It's basically its nickel, and you can use a microscope"
00:16:14,00:16:17,"to head in towards, and you can read a thousand languages."
00:16:17,00:16:20,"So for a second time, we've ceded the idea of language"
00:16:20,00:16:24,"that may die very soon into the universe, which is quite cool."
00:16:24,00:16:24,It would just sit there.
00:16:24,00:16:27,All the aliens that have just finished building a record player.
00:16:27,00:16:29,[LAUGHTER]
00:16:29,00:16:29,"Oh, great."
00:16:29,00:16:32,"Finally, we can-- oh, wait, what's this for, man?"
00:16:32,00:16:34,[LAUGHTER]
00:16:34,00:16:38,"Risetta took 116,000 photos on the mission,"
00:16:38,00:16:41,and it sent back 218 gigabytes of data.
00:16:41,00:16:44,I don't even say it sent back 218 of them.
00:16:44,00:16:45,Like it's taken so far feet.
00:16:45,00:16:49,"No, no, no, no."
00:16:49,00:16:51,It sent back 218 gigabytes of data.
00:16:51,00:16:54,And I worked out that what that would be
00:16:54,00:16:57,is 872 copies of the film Deep Impact.
00:16:57,00:17:01,[LAUGHTER]
00:17:01,00:17:03,That's the only version I could find of the film Deep Impact
00:17:03,00:17:04,online was dubbed into Tamil.
00:17:04,00:17:07,So it might be slightly more or fewer.
00:17:07,00:17:10,"Speaking of Deep Impact, I was surprised"
00:17:10,00:17:12,that no one has got angry about the fact
00:17:12,00:17:17,"so far that Risetta has gone into the actual comet,"
00:17:17,00:17:22,"because in 2005, NASA crashed their probe Deep Impact"
00:17:22,00:17:25,"into a comet called Tempel-1, and an astrologer"
00:17:25,00:17:27,"tried to sue NASA, saying that they"
00:17:27,00:17:30,had upset the balance of the universe.
00:17:30,00:17:32,"Well, all of these horoscopes are bollocks now, aren't they?"
00:17:32,00:17:34,[LAUGHTER]
00:17:38,00:17:40,"OK, so we're halfway through the show,"
00:17:40,00:17:42,and it's time to look at the stories that you've sent
00:17:42,00:17:47,"into us via emails and social media, starting with James."
00:17:47,00:17:50,"OK, this one comes from a David Smith."
00:17:50,00:17:55,"It's @dvdsmith on Twitter, and it comes from the independent."
00:17:55,00:17:58,A Russian children's charity has had a million flyers
00:17:58,00:18:03,printed asking people to exterminate beavers.
00:18:03,00:18:04,That's due to a misprint.
00:18:04,00:18:06,"It should have read, do good."
00:18:06,00:18:10,[LAUGHTER]
00:18:10,00:18:11,Anna?
00:18:11,00:18:15,"This is a tweet from @iOfCever, and it comes from the Florida Sun"
00:18:15,00:18:18,"Posts, and it's a story that a 68-year-old man who"
00:18:18,00:18:21,married a 24-year-old woman only to discover
00:18:21,00:18:23,when looking through family photos that she's
00:18:23,00:18:27,a strange biological granddaughter said they have no plans
00:18:27,00:18:28,to divorce.
00:18:28,00:18:30,"He said, ""I've already had two failed marriages,"
00:18:30,00:18:35,"and I'm determined not to have a third."""
00:18:35,00:18:36,"And finally, Andy."
00:18:36,00:18:39,My fact has been sent in from Kenzie Lee.
00:18:39,00:18:42,An employee of the Canadian Mint is currently on trial accused
00:18:42,00:18:46,"of smuggling £100,000 worth of gold out of the building"
00:18:46,00:18:48,in his rectum.
00:18:48,00:18:52,He kept on setting off the metal detector when he was leaving.
00:18:52,00:18:54,And they kept on doing a sort of pat down search.
00:18:54,00:18:56,"Nothing there, OK, well."
00:18:56,00:18:58,And then they found some gold pucks and a tub of Vaseline
00:18:58,00:19:00,in his locker.
00:19:00,00:19:03,And he maintains that this is completely circumstantial evidence
00:19:03,00:19:04,as well.
00:19:04,00:19:09,"Anyway, here's the moment innocent until proven guilty."
00:19:09,00:19:12,Until proven really weird.
00:19:12,00:19:16,"OK, it is time for fact number three, and that is James."
00:19:16,00:19:20,"OK, my fact this week is that Nobel Prize winners always"
00:19:20,00:19:23,immediately return their award so they don't lose it
00:19:23,00:19:25,in the subsequent party.
00:19:25,00:19:31,"This makes it sound like as soon as they get the award,"
00:19:31,00:19:33,it kicks off.
00:19:33,00:19:35,"So I think the key to the fun that they have,"
00:19:35,00:19:37,"because they definitely do have fun, is that."
00:19:37,00:19:42,"They made sure that every year 200 of the 1,300 seats"
00:19:42,00:19:45,there are allocated to students from the uni.
00:19:45,00:19:46,"Yes, so that's what it is."
00:19:46,00:19:47,And a lot of the parties are led by students.
00:19:47,00:19:51,"So the best part of the Nobel Prize ceremony, apparently,"
00:19:51,00:19:53,"is the after party, and it's called Nobel Nightcap."
00:19:53,00:19:57,Do you know what they make the Nobel laureates do?
00:19:57,00:19:59,Shots.
00:19:59,00:20:02,They induct them into the order of the ever smiling
00:20:02,00:20:05,and jumping green frog.
00:20:05,00:20:08,"And everyone, like Richard Feynman, was a part of it."
00:20:08,00:20:10,"Richard Feynman was really excited because, as well,"
00:20:10,00:20:13,"as playing the bongos, he's an amazing physicist."
00:20:13,00:20:17,Most people just know him as a bongo player.
00:20:17,00:20:19,He was involved in science as well.
00:20:19,00:20:21,"And yeah, and they gave him one of these awards."
00:20:21,00:20:22,And he was really excited because he
00:20:22,00:20:23,does an awesome frog impression.
00:20:23,00:20:26,"So he was like, oh, finally, can bust this out of this."
00:20:26,00:20:27,And it's not weird.
00:20:27,00:20:30,"And so what they do is they get people who've won the prizes,"
00:20:30,00:20:34,"usually in physics, to be-- they have to leap like a frog."
00:20:34,00:20:36,And they also have a massive paper mache frog
00:20:36,00:20:38,that they have to carry all the way back
00:20:38,00:20:40,to the origin place of the frog.
00:20:40,00:20:43,So people who've just won the biggest award in science
00:20:43,00:20:47,can be seen at 2 a.m. with a huge paper mache frog.
00:20:47,00:20:49,"For real ones, it changes every year."
00:20:49,00:20:51,"The formality is, and sometimes it's"
00:20:51,00:20:53,a person dressed up as a frog.
00:20:53,00:20:55,They mix it up all the time.
00:20:55,00:20:56,"Of course, you say physics."
00:20:56,00:20:58,"And it is the Nobel prizes this week, isn't it?"
00:20:58,00:20:59,Yes.
00:20:59,00:21:01,And the physics prize has just been won by three British people.
00:21:01,00:21:02,Yeah.
00:21:02,00:21:04,Which is great.
00:21:04,00:21:06,"So there is a lot of partying, and it is very fun."
00:21:06,00:21:09,"But there also is the actual ceremony bit, which"
00:21:09,00:21:10,is very serious.
00:21:10,00:21:13,And so all Nobel laureates get a course
00:21:13,00:21:16,in how to receive the actual prize from the king.
00:21:16,00:21:20,So there was actually a British Nobel prize winner
00:21:20,00:21:21,called Paul Nurse.
00:21:21,00:21:25,And they use his video as an example of how not to accept it.
00:21:25,00:21:27,He got his medal turned around and held it up
00:21:27,00:21:30,"like he'd won the World Cup in football, a classic Brit."
00:21:30,00:21:34,And they edited that out from his winning video.
00:21:34,00:21:38,And they apparently show that in the demonstration
00:21:38,00:21:40,of how to receive it by how not to receive it.
00:21:40,00:21:41,He could have done worse.
00:21:41,00:21:43,"He could have been, like, Kanut Hanson,"
00:21:43,00:21:45,who won the 1920 electric surprise.
00:21:45,00:21:46,"You don't need to tell us, Jane."
00:21:46,00:21:49,[LAUGHTER]
00:21:49,00:21:51,He got drunk and he pulled the whiskers
00:21:51,00:21:54,of an elderly Nobel committee man.
00:21:54,00:21:57,And then he snapped his finger against the corset
00:21:57,00:22:00,"of his fellow laureates' secret unset and shouted,"
00:22:00,00:22:02,"""It sounds like a bellboy."""
00:22:02,00:22:05,[LAUGHTER]
00:22:05,00:22:07,It was a different time.
00:22:07,00:22:11,So they give you the actual gold medal when you win.
00:22:11,00:22:12,"And for some reason, the economics one is very slightly"
00:22:12,00:22:14,larger than all the other fights on the white.
00:22:14,00:22:15,"It is 10 grams bigger, isn't it?"
00:22:15,00:22:16,"10 grams, I don't know why."
00:22:16,00:22:17,No explanation.
00:22:17,00:22:20,"But so there was a guy called Brian Schmidt,"
00:22:20,00:22:23,who won the 2011 prize for physics
00:22:23,00:22:25,"for discovering dark energy, basically."
00:22:25,00:22:26,And he went to his granny.
00:22:26,00:22:28,"She lives in Fargo, made famous, obviously,"
00:22:28,00:22:30,by the film and the TV series.
00:22:30,00:22:32,"And then on his way out at the airport,"
00:22:32,00:22:34,it was in his laptop bag.
00:22:34,00:22:37,And it came up on the screen as this completely black disc
00:22:37,00:22:38,that's made of gold.
00:22:38,00:22:41,And the airport guys were a bit freaked out.
00:22:41,00:22:43,And he reported the conversation they had.
00:22:43,00:22:46,"He said, they're like, sir, there's something in your bag."
00:22:46,00:22:47,"He said, yes, I think it's this box."
00:22:47,00:22:49,"They said, what's in the box?"
00:22:49,00:22:52,"He said, a large gold medal."
00:22:52,00:22:54,"They opened it and they said, what's it made out of?"
00:22:54,00:22:58,"And he says, gold."
00:22:58,00:23:01,"And then they said, who gave this to you?"
00:23:01,00:23:03,"And then he says, the king of Sweden."
00:23:03,00:23:09,"They say, why did he give this to you?"
00:23:09,00:23:11,"And he says, because I help discover"
00:23:11,00:23:13,the expansion rate of the universe is accelerating.
00:23:13,00:23:17,"At which point, they were beginning"
00:23:17,00:23:18,to lose their sense of humor.
00:23:21,00:23:23,And he tells them it's a Nobel Prize.
00:23:23,00:23:26,"And he says, and their main question was, why were you in Fargo?"
00:23:26,00:23:30,He could have saved a lot of problems
00:23:30,00:23:32,if he's smuggled it in his rectum.
00:23:32,00:23:37,"It's big, though."
00:23:37,00:23:38,At least it's not the economics one.
00:23:38,00:23:44,"As well as the medal, you obviously"
00:23:44,00:23:47,get the massive cash prize.
00:23:47,00:23:48,Why is it like a million dollars?
00:23:48,00:23:50,"Well, if fluctuates, I've read this article"
00:23:50,00:23:53,"where they talked about how people who've won the Nobel Prize,"
00:23:53,00:23:56,how scientists have spent the money that they've won.
00:23:56,00:23:58,One interesting one was Albert Einstein
00:23:58,00:24:00,who gave his money over to his first wife.
00:24:00,00:24:02,He gave it in 1921.
00:24:02,00:24:03,That's when he won it.
00:24:03,00:24:04,"But actually, he signed it over to her"
00:24:04,00:24:07,when they were divorcing in 1919.
00:24:07,00:24:09,"So he said, if I ever win the Nobel Prize,"
00:24:09,00:24:14,you can have the money in the divorce and then he won it.
00:24:14,00:24:16,"And she got the money, which is amazing."
00:24:16,00:24:18,You know they have the banquet?
00:24:18,00:24:19,Yeah.
00:24:19,00:24:20,So the 1300 guest banquet is incredible.
00:24:20,00:24:24,And sometimes there's major goss from the banquet.
00:24:24,00:24:26,So I was trying to look for a scandal at the banquet.
00:24:26,00:24:30,"And get this, guys."
00:24:30,00:24:33,This is according to the Svenska Dagbladet newspaper.
00:24:33,00:24:36,"Last year, the biggest scandal was a minor faux pas,"
00:24:36,00:24:38,which meant the king was last at his table
00:24:38,00:24:40,to be served the source for the main course.
00:24:40,00:24:46,It's amazing when you get that inside scoop.
00:24:46,00:24:49,"Hey, in banquet gossip."
00:24:49,00:24:51,I have to say--
00:24:51,00:24:55,I don't think it's going to cap the source incident.
00:24:55,00:24:56,You're right.
00:24:56,00:24:57,It goes alongside it.
00:24:57,00:25:00,So there's this blog written by a former planning
00:25:00,00:25:02,"secretary for the banquet, talking about the issues she"
00:25:02,00:25:03,come up against.
00:25:03,00:25:05,"And one of the things is a seating plan, which"
00:25:05,00:25:07,"is very difficult with 1,300 people."
00:25:07,00:25:08,"So obviously, a lot of colleagues attend together,"
00:25:08,00:25:11,because they're on the same science research group.
00:25:11,00:25:13,"And she says, seating plans do sometimes"
00:25:13,00:25:16,request that they be seated as far from their colleagues
00:25:16,00:25:17,as possible.
00:25:17,00:25:18,People who sit.
00:25:18,00:25:23,"There was one a few years ago where an American attendee,"
00:25:23,00:25:25,"and a Swedish attendee who didn't know each other,"
00:25:25,00:25:27,"were sat next to each other, and they're still married today."
00:25:27,00:25:29,So that's nice.
00:25:29,00:25:30,So nice.
00:25:30,00:25:33,And there was one where one of the Nobel laureates
00:25:33,00:25:37,"invited his ex-wife and his wife, and apparently,"
00:25:37,00:25:39,the Nobel committee received strict instructions
00:25:39,00:25:41,"to seat the ladies as far apart as possible,"
00:25:41,00:25:44,without any possibility of eye contacts.
00:25:44,00:25:45,Wow.
00:25:45,00:25:50,"Luckily, it was the peace prize."
00:25:50,00:25:53,"OK, it is time for our final fact of the show."
00:25:53,00:25:54,"And that is, my fact."
00:25:54,00:25:58,My fact this week is that two recently recovered stolen
00:25:58,00:26:02,vangoff paintings would buy you enough cocaine
00:26:02,00:26:06,that you could snort a continuous line from here to Moscow.
00:26:06,00:26:14,And you'd still have a bit left over for when you get there.
00:26:15,00:26:17,"So the reason that we know this is that two,"
00:26:17,00:26:21,"you may have seen in the news this week, two very famously stolen"
00:26:21,00:26:25,"vangoff paintings, which were taken back in 2002"
00:26:25,00:26:27,from the Vangoff Museum in Amsterdam were recovered.
00:26:27,00:26:30,"And they were found in Italy, near Naples,"
00:26:30,00:26:34,in the property of a famous cocaine mafia cartel.
00:26:34,00:26:38,And the idea is that they were using these paintings as currency.
00:26:38,00:26:42,So we found out how much one vangoff would be worth.
00:26:42,00:26:44,"We doubled it, and then we worked out how much cocaine"
00:26:44,00:26:46,that would be equivalent to--
00:26:46,00:26:47,"It's a shame that you have to make this swap,"
00:26:47,00:26:49,"because once you're given away the paintings,"
00:26:49,00:26:53,you've got nothing to snort the cocaine off of it.
00:26:53,00:26:57,Because that's the most rock 'n' roll moment of your life.
00:26:57,00:27:00,"When these two paintings disappeared,"
00:27:00,00:27:04,they actually found the people that they thought may have stolen it.
00:27:04,00:27:07,"I mean, it's a guy sent-- there were two people sent to prison, weren't they?"
00:27:07,00:27:07,Yes.
00:27:07,00:27:10,The main one was called Octave Durham.
00:27:10,00:27:13,"And he was known to the police as the monkey,"
00:27:13,00:27:16,because he was so good at evading arrest.
00:27:16,00:27:18,As monkeys are.
00:27:18,00:27:20,I'm going to try to slap the cuffs on the monkey.
00:27:20,00:27:22,They've got the little claws.
00:27:22,00:27:24,"I checked, and actually only two monkeys"
00:27:24,00:27:26,have been arrested in the last year.
00:27:26,00:27:37,"One was for harassing locals in Mumbai,"
00:27:37,00:27:42,and the other was after a high-speed chase in Washington State.
00:27:42,00:27:45,"He was sitting on the back of the guy who was driving,"
00:27:45,00:27:48,"so it hardly seems fair, and they did let it go quite quickly afterwards."
00:27:48,00:27:50,But still in the rest.
00:27:50,00:27:52,"So they never recovered the paintings from them,"
00:27:52,00:27:55,"but they assumed it was them, because at the site,"
00:27:55,00:27:58,"they found their DNA on the ropes, on the ladders,"
00:27:58,00:28:02,and on both hats that they left behind.
00:28:02,00:28:04,"Like a monkey, where's that?"
00:28:07,00:28:10,The banana peels everywhere.
00:28:10,00:28:14,"So one of the things is that they got four years jail sentence,"
00:28:14,00:28:17,"and they were denying it, obviously, that they'd stolen it."
00:28:17,00:28:19,"And they thought maybe the reason they hadn't admitted to it,"
00:28:19,00:28:21,"and probably played against them in the trial,"
00:28:21,00:28:26,"is the fact that Dutch law states that if there is a stolen bit of art,"
00:28:26,00:28:29,"and it's missing for 30 years, whoever is in possession of it, owns it."
00:28:29,00:28:32,"So they thought that they were going to wait 30 years,"
00:28:32,00:28:37,"and then go, oh, look what we found, and then legally, that's fine."
00:28:37,00:28:38,"Incredible, isn't it, that that might be true?"
00:28:38,00:28:41,"Yeah. But they own it, but would they still go into prison"
00:28:41,00:28:42,for committing the crime?
00:28:42,00:28:43,"Yeah, probably."
00:28:43,00:28:44,"Well, they did the time, I guess."
00:28:44,00:28:46,They did the four years for the theft.
00:28:46,00:28:51,"Apparently, all these old laws date from the time when Amsterdam"
00:28:51,00:28:54,were massive parts where people could steal things and then just disappear.
00:28:54,00:28:57,And so they have a load of kind of slightly weird arcane laws
00:28:57,00:28:59,that still are on the statute books.
00:28:59,00:29:00,We have a law about that.
00:29:00,00:29:02,"We have a Finders Keepers law, where if you find something"
00:29:02,00:29:06,"had been to the police, and a few weeks later, it's been unclamed,"
00:29:06,00:29:07,you get it.
00:29:07,00:29:09,Is there a loser's weepers law?
00:29:09,00:29:11,[LAUGHTER]
00:29:11,00:29:17,"There has been another development in art, theft news."
00:29:17,00:29:21,"So the FBI has a top 10 art crimes list, which I didn't know."
00:29:21,00:29:27,And one of them is theft in 1990 from the Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum in Boston.
00:29:27,00:29:30,"And this year, the FBI dug up the garden of a mafia boss,"
00:29:30,00:29:32,"called Roberto Gentile, to try to find it."
00:29:32,00:29:34,It didn't find any of the paintings that were missing.
00:29:34,00:29:37,And this is the evidence they've got against him.
00:29:37,00:29:39,"He did a polygraph test, which assessed the likelihood"
00:29:39,00:29:41,he was telling the truth about not being
00:29:41,00:29:44,involved at less than 0.1%.
00:29:44,00:29:50,He was found to have a handwritten list of the stolen artworks and their values.
00:29:50,00:29:56,And he was recorded telling an FBI agent he had two of the stolen paintings.
00:29:56,00:29:58,"Well, this is the biggest ever art theft in the US."
00:29:58,00:30:03,And the way they did it is so movies star-style.
00:30:03,00:30:05,"They dressed up as policemen, these two guys."
00:30:05,00:30:08,"And they turned up and said to the security guards,"
00:30:08,00:30:12,"hey, we got a call about disturbance in this art gallery full of priceless things."
00:30:12,00:30:12,Can we get in?
00:30:12,00:30:15,And so the security guards let them in.
00:30:15,00:30:19,"And then as soon as they'd been let in, they said, in your face, this is the robbery."
00:30:19,00:30:21,"I think they did-- in fact, I think they were quite polite about it."
00:30:21,00:30:22,They did the classic thing.
00:30:22,00:30:24,"They said, gentlemen, this is a robbery."
00:30:24,00:30:26,And then tied them up and stole the stuff.
00:30:26,00:30:29,Kim Kardashian got robbed in Shibuya.
00:30:29,00:30:32,"And they reckon that might have been the Pink Panther gang,"
00:30:32,00:30:34,who apparently have lots of these kind of tricks.
00:30:34,00:30:37,"Like, sometimes they get away on bikes, dressed as women,"
00:30:37,00:30:41,"and sometimes they get away in speedboats and one time,"
00:30:41,00:30:42,so they didn't get spotted.
00:30:42,00:30:45,"They put wet paint signs on all the benches nearby,"
00:30:45,00:30:47,so no one would sit on them.
00:30:47,00:30:48,And always with the theme tune.
00:30:48,00:30:56,There's-- I read an interesting story about art heists.
00:30:56,00:31:00,So there was a story about a guy who he was called Radu Dogara.
00:31:00,00:31:05,And he stole $26.38 million worth of art.
00:31:05,00:31:07,And so he was caught and he was going to trial.
00:31:07,00:31:10,And he said that he was willing to divulge where all of the art was.
00:31:10,00:31:15,"The only condition was that he got a Dutch trial instead of a Romanian trial,"
00:31:15,00:31:19,because it turns out that the laws are different in every different country
00:31:19,00:31:22,for how severe a sentence you get for stealing art.
00:31:22,00:31:25,"And the Dutch laws are way less severe than they are in Romania,"
00:31:25,00:31:26,where they're extremely severe.
00:31:26,00:31:30,So it's a difference between four years in jail or 20 years in jail.
00:31:30,00:31:32,So I looked for the best place to steal art from.
00:31:32,00:31:35,[LAUGHTER]
00:31:35,00:31:39,And it turns out it's on Norwegian cruises.
00:31:39,00:31:39,OK.
00:31:39,00:31:40,Yeah.
00:31:40,00:31:45,"So a guy, a Kentucky native, called Kevin Hudgens, he recently stole it."
00:31:45,00:31:49,"It was a copy of a Rembrandt, still worth about $13,000 American dollars."
00:31:49,00:31:53,"And he stole it, but he happened to steal it while the cruiser he was on,"
00:31:53,00:31:54,docked in Bermuda.
00:31:54,00:31:56,"And in Bermuda, they just don't care."
00:31:56,00:31:57,"They're like, that's fine."
00:31:57,00:32:02,"And his trial, because wherever the boat docks, that's where you are the law of."
00:32:02,00:32:06,And so he got fined $500 for stealing it.
00:32:06,00:32:10,"As opposed to 20 years in jail, had he docked in Romania, for example."
00:32:10,00:32:14,"So if you're on a cruise and there's a good bit of art, check out where you're docking."
00:32:14,00:32:16,Check out the cruise's Romania.
00:32:16,00:32:17,"Yeah, exactly."
00:32:17,00:32:20,"But if you're heading to Bermuda, have a look at the walls on the ship."
00:32:20,00:32:21,[LAUGHTER]
00:32:21,00:32:24,"I mean, Romania is-- it's not completely like Mott,"
00:32:24,00:32:28,but there's not that many cruises go there at all.
00:32:28,00:32:31,Has anyone else been researching cocaine news just quickly on that?
00:32:31,00:32:34,So this is a story from last week in Seattle.
00:32:34,00:32:36,"The police got handed a suitcase, which had been lost."
00:32:36,00:32:41,"And they said, well, let's look inside and see if we can find any clues to whoever might have owned it."
00:32:41,00:32:42,They opened it up.
00:32:42,00:32:47,"They found 31 bags of cocaine, a scale for all the cocaine."
00:32:47,00:32:50,"Some marijuana, because you got bored of cocaine."
00:32:50,00:32:51,[LAUGHTER]
00:32:51,00:32:55,[LAUGHTER]
00:32:55,00:32:58,And a 19-year-old man's ID card and mobile phone.
00:32:58,00:33:02,[LAUGHTER]
00:33:02,00:33:04,"A little while after this had been handed in,"
00:33:04,00:33:09,"a 19-year-old man approached police, saying he had lost his briefcase,"
00:33:09,00:33:13,and he needed it back as it contained some extremely important paperwork.
00:33:13,00:33:14,[LAUGHTER]
00:33:14,00:33:15,"Oh, man."
00:33:15,00:33:18,He was arrested because of all the cocaine.
00:33:18,00:33:19,[LAUGHTER]
00:33:19,00:33:20,Yeah.
00:33:20,00:33:22,I found one bit of cocaine news.
00:33:22,00:33:24,"It's a study, a new study."
00:33:24,00:33:28,Scientists have found that cocaine makes fish feel drowsy.
00:33:28,00:33:29,[LAUGHTER]
00:33:29,00:33:32,"Yeah, they gave some cocaine to some zebrafish."
00:33:32,00:33:36,"And also, they can take 100 times more cocaine than mice can,"
00:33:36,00:33:39,"and 1,000 times more cocaine than humans can."
00:33:39,00:33:40,Wow.
00:33:40,00:33:42,"What, but they're just blinking very, very fast."
00:33:42,00:33:43,[LAUGHTER]
00:33:43,00:33:44,Slow.
00:33:44,00:33:45,I guess it's slowing down.
00:33:45,00:33:46,"Yeah, it's slowing down."
00:33:46,00:33:47,"Oh, yeah, of course."
00:33:47,00:33:48,It's sour.
00:33:48,00:33:52,"There was another study on cocaine in the last week, actually."
00:33:52,00:33:53,"So, it runs out that."
00:33:53,00:33:54,[LAUGHTER]
00:33:54,00:33:56,It's not turning into cocaine news.
00:33:56,00:33:58,What's going to cocaine news?
00:33:58,00:33:59,[LAUGHTER]
00:33:59,00:33:59,Do you want news?
00:33:59,00:34:00,We got news.
00:34:00,00:34:03,[LAUGHTER]
00:34:03,00:34:06,The reason Andy's so anxious is that it's most likely
00:34:06,00:34:09,his cocaine is cut with a flesh-eating substance.
00:34:09,00:34:14,"So 65% of cocaine in this country is now cut with this thing called levamisol,"
00:34:14,00:34:17,which literally rot human flesh.
00:34:17,00:34:19,"And so, yeah, I know, nice."
00:34:19,00:34:22,"It's used by farmers to poach their livestock of parasitic worms, usually."
00:34:22,00:34:25,But it also serves this extra purpose.
00:34:25,00:34:27,But it keeps the weight off.
00:34:27,00:34:28,[LAUGHTER]
00:34:28,00:34:29,[APPLAUSE]
00:34:29,00:34:34,"OK, that's it."
00:34:34,00:34:35,That's all of our facts.
00:34:35,00:34:38,Just time to share with you the four stories
00:34:38,00:34:40,that we didn't have time to get through during the show.
00:34:40,00:34:42,And we're going to start with mine.
00:34:42,00:34:45,My fact is that North Korea has banned sarcasm
00:34:45,00:34:48,because Tim Jong-un is worried that people
00:34:48,00:34:50,are only agreeing with him ironically.
00:34:50,00:34:54,[LAUGHTER]
00:34:54,00:34:55,James?
00:34:55,00:34:57,"OK, mine is that the police in Utah"
00:34:57,00:35:01,have officially recommended against shooting random clowns.
00:35:01,00:35:04,[LAUGHTER]
00:35:04,00:35:08,"OK, Andy."
00:35:08,00:35:09,This is from the Times of India.
00:35:09,00:35:12,A building in Massachusetts had to be evacuated
00:35:12,00:35:14,"after residents complained about a peculiar smell,"
00:35:14,00:35:17,which turned out to be caused by a man cooking urine in his flat.
00:35:17,00:35:21,[LAUGHTER]
00:35:21,00:35:23,"Finally, Anna."
00:35:23,00:35:26,"Yep, this is from the National Post of Canada."
00:35:26,00:35:29,And this is after the official opening of a ring road
00:35:29,00:35:31,"in Edmonton, Canada on Saturday,"
00:35:31,00:35:35,"murderous were surprised by a large electronic sign announcing,"
00:35:35,00:35:36,"we done, bitches."
00:35:36,00:35:39,[LAUGHTER]
00:35:39,00:35:44,"That's all from me, Andy James and Anna."
00:35:44,00:35:45,We'll be back again next week.
00:35:45,00:35:47,We've been No Such Thinkers and News.
00:35:47,00:35:48,Good night.
00:35:48,00:35:51,[APPLAUSE]
00:35:51,00:35:54,[MUSIC PLAYING]
