1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,240
 Hi guys, just before we start this episode,

2
00:00:02,240 --> 00:00:04,060
 just to let you know, we will be recording

3
00:00:04,060 --> 00:00:07,200
 the first episode of series two of no such things

4
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:08,360
 the news next week.

5
00:00:08,360 --> 00:00:10,880
 And we're recording that live on Tuesday.

6
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:13,440
 And for the middle section of the TV show,

7
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:15,880
 we would like to use the most interesting facts

8
00:00:15,880 --> 00:00:18,560
 that you guys, our audience, has learned from the news

9
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:20,280
 over the past seven days.

10
00:00:20,280 --> 00:00:22,160
 So if you've seen anything interesting in the news,

11
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:25,840
 tweet it to @QIPodcast, email podcast@QI.com

12
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:29,840
 or post it up on the no such things a fish Facebook page.

13
00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:32,200
 And we'll pick our favorites and news in the middle of the show.

14
00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:33,920
 OK, hope you enjoyed this show, which

15
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:36,240
 is a recording of the dummy run for no such things

16
00:00:36,240 --> 00:00:39,720
 the news that we did live last week on with the show.

17
00:00:39,720 --> 00:00:42,040
 [MUSIC PLAYING]

18
00:00:42,040 --> 00:00:57,440
 Now, hello, and welcome to another episode

19
00:00:57,440 --> 00:00:59,040
 of no such thing as the news coming

20
00:00:59,040 --> 00:01:01,440
 to you from Up the Creek in Greenwich, London.

21
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:03,520
 My name is Dan Shriver, and I'm sitting here

22
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:07,320
 with Anna Chazinski, Andrew Hunter Murray, and James Harkin.

23
00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:11,040
 [APPLAUSE]

24
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:14,520
 Once again, we're here to present the most interesting stories

25
00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:16,960
 we found in the news of the last seven days.

26
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:21,520
 And in no particular order, here we go, starting with you, Chazinski.

27
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:24,440
 My fact this week is that one of these stalls

28
00:01:24,440 --> 00:01:27,000
 at the Conservative Party conference this week

29
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,960
 is a grounds shooting simulator.

30
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:31,240
 [LAUGHTER]

31
00:01:31,240 --> 00:01:35,120
 Sort of normal ordinary things as struggling families.

32
00:01:35,120 --> 00:01:36,600
 So this is in the mirror, in fact.

33
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:39,240
 So a mirror journalist went around the Conservative Party

34
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:40,920
 conference and made a list of the most

35
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:43,360
 Tory things at the Tory conference.

36
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:45,640
 And that unsurprisingly made the list.

37
00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:48,720
 Well, the grass simulator, you obviously

38
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:49,920
 saw what it looks like.

39
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:52,680
 It's like a little thing that you attach on this kind of fake gun,

40
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:56,000
 but you can attach it on your own gun if you want to.

41
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
 It's so inclined.

42
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:01,000
 How many people at the Conservative conference went,

43
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,680
 "Oh, actually, I've brought my own gun."

44
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:05,440
 And actually, there's a lady called

45
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:08,280
 Danka Batekeva, who's Slovakian, who

46
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:10,720
 used this grounds simulator when she was training

47
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:11,800
 for the London Olympics.

48
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:14,000
 And she won a medal at the London Olympics.

49
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,680
 Really?

50
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:17,360
 Oh, cool.

51
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:19,520
 So it's a useful and interesting thing,

52
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:21,480
 and not just chance for landowners

53
00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:24,040
 to show off their shooting prowess.

54
00:02:24,040 --> 00:02:27,160
 I have to say, reading about the Tory party conference,

55
00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:30,640
 I just thought it looks so fun.

56
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:33,440
 I know, politically, you could sit on either side,

57
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:35,400
 but as an event, it looks so much fun.

58
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:36,720
 And I went on Twitter and I thought,

59
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:38,400
 I wonder if people are tweeting about this saying,

60
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:39,280
 this is really fun.

61
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:40,120
 And they were.

62
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:41,720
 So many people were just--

63
00:02:41,720 --> 00:02:44,600
 because it was a hashtag CPC16.

64
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:47,360
 And I put CPC16 fun.

65
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:49,760
 And it just came up with all these tweets going.

66
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:53,600
 If you search CPC16 crap, you would have got a lot of these.

67
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:57,040
 Well, I search CPC16 boring.

68
00:02:57,040 --> 00:03:00,120
 And actually, today, there was a lot of boring stuff going on,

69
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:01,960
 mainly about Hammond speech.

70
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:03,560
 I don't know if you heard about Hammond speech.

71
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:05,480
 So there were a few tweets, I saved.

72
00:03:05,480 --> 00:03:07,920
 One that said, Hammond so boring, TFL

73
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:10,440
 wants to use him on the tunnels for the London Crossrail.

74
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:11,720
 Project.

75
00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:12,560
 Good.

76
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:13,800
 And then on the fun side, because there

77
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:14,760
 were lots of fun tweets.

78
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:16,400
 This guy said, fucking hell.

79
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:18,680
 It's 1/3 in the morning, and I'm listening to two men

80
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:21,560
 arguing about the Turnstile Act of 1963.

81
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:23,880
 And the CPC16 is so fun at eggs.

82
00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:27,160
 [LAUGHTER]

83
00:03:27,160 --> 00:03:28,840
 I think you might be missing a note of sarcasm

84
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:30,760
 because that was his speech.

85
00:03:30,760 --> 00:03:33,560
 I am here to tell you, having been to party conference

86
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:35,640
 or two, that they are all lying.

87
00:03:35,640 --> 00:03:38,120
 The people who want to be promoted within the Tory party

88
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:40,080
 are going, so it is not in their interest to go,

89
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:42,000
 this is a fucking waste of time, isn't it?

90
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,480
 I think they have to say, I'm having the time of my lying.

91
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:47,200
 I don't know, because there was an owl

92
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:48,920
 that you could hold on your arm.

93
00:03:48,920 --> 00:03:50,360
 [LAUGHTER]

94
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:52,000
 It's a real owl.

95
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:52,840
 It's a real owl.

96
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:54,840
 Unfortunately, a lot of Tories brought their own guns,

97
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:56,960
 and that owl didn't like that.

98
00:03:56,960 --> 00:03:57,800
 It wasn't mixed up.

99
00:03:57,800 --> 00:04:00,240
 They shouldn't put those two things next to each other.

100
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:02,320
 One person, I'm not sure he was having a great time,

101
00:04:02,320 --> 00:04:04,560
 is Camden Councillor Johnny Bucknell,

102
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:07,720
 who spent the conference sleeping in his car.

103
00:04:07,720 --> 00:04:10,120
 And what he thinks is, these conferences shouldn't

104
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:12,400
 be held in big cities, where all the hotels are really

105
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:13,000
 expensive.

106
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,400
 They should be held in like Blackpool,

107
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:16,720
 where it's £10 a night or something.

108
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:18,160
 That's what he said.

109
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:20,360
 And so I looked at the other things that he's

110
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:21,600
 done in the last year or so.

111
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:23,840
 And this is all that's in the news about him.

112
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:27,480
 He was £30,000 for being a Shiny landlord.

113
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:29,800
 And he was told off for eating roast duck

114
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:36,720
 during a town hall meeting, after which he vowed to campaign

115
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:38,960
 for the right to have a roast meal during meetings.

116
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:42,080
 [LAUGHTER]

117
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:44,840
 Do you know what you could get at the Lib Dem conference?

118
00:04:44,840 --> 00:04:45,360
 This year.

119
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:46,360
 There's another bit of murder.

120
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:47,360
 A seat?

121
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:50,120
 [LAUGHTER]

122
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:54,200
 [APPLAUSE]

123
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:55,920
 I think you'll find James seats are the one thing.

124
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:57,240
 The Lib Dem conference's struggling way.

125
00:04:57,240 --> 00:04:59,080
 [LAUGHTER]

126
00:04:59,080 --> 00:05:04,120
 No, they also have--

127
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:05,760
 I mean, all the party conferences are there in March.

128
00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:08,000
 But the Lib Dem conference, you can get branded

129
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,720
 18th birthday cards, Lib Dem themed,

130
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:17,280
 in a pack of 50, for someone who has 50,

131
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:20,040
 young nephews or nieces.

132
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:20,920
 Don't worry, darling.

133
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:22,600
 You can sell them to pay off your student loan.

134
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:25,200
 [LAUGHTER]

135
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:28,360
 It was the Looney conference this week,

136
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:31,120
 earlier this week, for the Monster Raven Looney party.

137
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:36,440
 They held it in Blackpool, Uncle Tom's cabin pub.

138
00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:38,320
 And I went on the website, and they

139
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:40,320
 had a whole load of things that was going to happen there.

140
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:43,280
 And they said, very sorry to say that Vince Cornwall

141
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:46,400
 and his rodent rap show will not be appearing this year.

142
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:48,800
 [LAUGHTER]

143
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:51,360
 Vince has had surgery and been told to take it easy,

144
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:54,000
 although he is open about, I will be attending with Andrew

145
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000
 the Rat.

146
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:59,280
 [LAUGHTER]

147
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:01,840
 There was an incident at the UKIP party conference,

148
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:03,480
 which was in September.

149
00:06:03,480 --> 00:06:05,240
 One of the failed leadership candidates

150
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:06,760
 called Lisa Duffy went out for dinner.

151
00:06:06,760 --> 00:06:08,320
 The conference was in Bournemouth.

152
00:06:08,320 --> 00:06:11,480
 And the place was raided by immigration officials

153
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:14,880
 who wanted to check the visa status of the people working

154
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:15,720
 in the restaurant.

155
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:18,360
 And apparently, the chef she said ran away into the night.

156
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:20,560
 So she said, watching our chef running away into the night

157
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:24,200
 is apron flapping in the wind with a surreal moment.

158
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:26,600
 Turned out, they were all completely legally working in the UK.

159
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:28,640
 So I have no idea why he ran away.

160
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:30,960
 [LAUGHTER]

161
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:33,960
 Could be the idea of having to serve a whole bunch of UKIP candidates

162
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:35,160
 at the end of the day.

163
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:38,120
 [LAUGHTER]

164
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:40,360
 The journalists and politicians

165
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:42,800
 have a football match at every Labour and Tory party

166
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:44,240
 conference, which I didn't realise.

167
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:48,600
 So this year, the lobby 11, which is the team of journalists,

168
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:50,080
 played the Tory MPs.

169
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:52,520
 And a Tory's lost five to this year.

170
00:06:52,520 --> 00:06:54,560
 In 2014, they lost seven to.

171
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:56,360
 That's because they're all on the right wing.

172
00:06:56,360 --> 00:06:57,880
 [LAUGHTER]

173
00:06:57,880 --> 00:07:02,120
 Another thing that's been in the news

174
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:06,080
 and is related to football this week is the Hungarian referendum.

175
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:09,000
 So this is a referendum as to whether Hungary wants

176
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,840
 to allow the EU to force that they take in.

177
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:15,480
 Only another 1,300, I think, asylum seekers.

178
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:16,880
 And they voted against it.

179
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:19,280
 But the Prime Minister of Hungary, Victor Orban,

180
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:21,640
 who brought this referendum, is a former footballer,

181
00:07:21,640 --> 00:07:26,440
 and he features in the 2006 edition of Football Manager.

182
00:07:26,440 --> 00:07:28,560
 So if anyone has that, he's there.

183
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:31,760
 He plays for Feltzut FC.

184
00:07:31,760 --> 00:07:34,360
 He-- yeah, yeah.

185
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:37,920
 Speaking of games and also simulators,

186
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:41,240
 the top app at the moment is a simulator.

187
00:07:41,240 --> 00:07:44,720
 This is PewDiePie's YouTuber simulator,

188
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:47,400
 where you get to pretend to be a YouTuber.

189
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:48,880
 It's a great game.

190
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:51,080
 What, so do you-- you wear a simulator

191
00:07:51,080 --> 00:07:54,200
 and you're just looking into a camera and going,

192
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:56,360
 oh, my life's so crazy, I just--

193
00:07:56,360 --> 00:08:00,160
 Amazingly, it's even more boring than that.

194
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:01,560
 You're a character on your phone,

195
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:03,760
 and you're in your bedroom with a computer,

196
00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:06,280
 and you have to make videos.

197
00:08:06,280 --> 00:08:07,680
 You don't get to really make videos.

198
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:10,080
 You just get to pretend to make videos.

199
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:12,160
 And then they get views, and you get money for that,

200
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:16,800
 and you can buy more things to decorate your bedroom with.

201
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:17,920
 Your fake bedroom?

202
00:08:17,920 --> 00:08:18,880
 Your fake bedroom, yeah.

203
00:08:18,880 --> 00:08:22,440
 I played it this morning, which is why my research

204
00:08:22,440 --> 00:08:25,080
 is a bit kind of short this week.

205
00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:26,120
 No, I made a video.

206
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:29,040
 It got 13 views and three subscribers,

207
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:32,520
 and it got me enough money to buy a cardboard box.

208
00:08:32,520 --> 00:08:34,400
 It was quite in my bedroom.

209
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:36,720
 And then I had to wait for it to get delivered,

210
00:08:36,720 --> 00:08:39,400
 and it certainly would take 30 seconds, and my app crashed,

211
00:08:39,400 --> 00:08:41,400
 and it took me three minutes.

212
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:44,600
 And then I just got bored, and I stopped playing.

213
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:46,560
 And this app is made by the same people

214
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:53,560
 who made goats simulator, a game in which players can drag things,

215
00:08:53,560 --> 00:08:57,920
 wiggle things, throw things, and lick things.

216
00:08:57,920 --> 00:09:01,200
 I think it needs to be specifying what thing.

217
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:04,640
 There's a new virtual reality simulator out as well,

218
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:05,760
 so you put it on your head.

219
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:09,200
 And what it is, the game is your lonely cow

220
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:10,640
 in a field.

221
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:12,280
 Yeah, genuinely.

222
00:09:12,280 --> 00:09:13,800
 And there's no other cows.

223
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:19,120
 And people come, and they taser you, and force you into a truck.

224
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:21,840
 And it's meant to raise awareness about how cows

225
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:24,440
 are being treated in the world today.

226
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:25,240
 It doesn't sound that fun.

227
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:26,960
 Does it now? I say that now.

228
00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:28,760
 Well, the pictures look amazing, because you're on all fours,

229
00:09:28,760 --> 00:09:30,880
 and you're just walking around your living room,

230
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:35,360
 occasionally going, oh, when you're tasered.

231
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:39,160
 And there's another one where you can be a piece of coral,

232
00:09:39,160 --> 00:09:42,600
 it's another virtual reality simulator, and you sit,

233
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:46,560
 and you're a piece of coral, and you watch the reef decay

234
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:49,320
 from acids that are let into the water.

235
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:51,280
 The one thing I know about coral is they get

236
00:09:51,280 --> 00:09:53,880
 most of their nutrients from urine.

237
00:09:53,880 --> 00:09:55,840
 They get it from fish urine.

238
00:09:55,840 --> 00:09:59,640
 So parents don't buy this game for your children.

239
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:01,440
 We need to move on in a sex, or an X-Fact.

240
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:04,280
 Anything before we do? Just back to politics, one thing.

241
00:10:04,280 --> 00:10:09,120
 So there's been an election in Brazil for the mayor of Sao Paulo,

242
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:12,000
 and the man who has won is the host

243
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,600
 of the Brazilian version of the apprentice.

244
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:16,360
 Oh, oh! Oh!

245
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:18,120
 Yeah. I know.

246
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:22,000
 What are the chances it'll happen twice in one day?

247
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:27,160
 OK, it is time for fact number two, and that is Andy.

248
00:10:27,160 --> 00:10:29,640
 My fact is that comets sound like a cross

249
00:10:29,640 --> 00:10:32,200
 between a cat and a dolphin.

250
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:33,200
 Yeah.

251
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:34,400
 You mean the noise that they make?

252
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:35,240
 I mean, the noise they make.

253
00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:40,680
 So this week, the comets 67P Churuyumov-Garassimenko,

254
00:10:40,680 --> 00:10:44,480
 the Rosetta satellite has the probe.

255
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:45,720
 We call it a probe.

256
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:47,320
 Probe? Probe.

257
00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:49,560
 [LAUGHTER]

258
00:10:49,560 --> 00:10:51,280
 It's weird when people shout "probe" at you.

259
00:10:51,280 --> 00:10:54,520
 [LAUGHTER]

260
00:10:54,520 --> 00:10:56,160
 I'm used to it. OK, go.

261
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:57,160
 [LAUGHTER]

262
00:10:57,160 --> 00:11:00,160
 So they've gathered so much data from this comet

263
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:02,080
 that they never had before, and one of the things they found

264
00:11:02,080 --> 00:11:04,120
 is it gives us this low-frequency hum,

265
00:11:04,120 --> 00:11:05,960
 and they're not exactly clear why it might be

266
00:11:05,960 --> 00:11:09,560
 because it has charged particles in the gas and the dust jets

267
00:11:09,560 --> 00:11:12,040
 that it gives out, and I think we can play it.

268
00:11:12,040 --> 00:11:14,600
 This is a sped up version of it, because it's normally

269
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:15,440
 above the range.

270
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:19,960
 [PHONE RINGING]

271
00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:21,080
 That's kind of dolphin-ing?

272
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:22,360
 I hear the dolphin.

273
00:11:22,360 --> 00:11:23,080
 Yeah.

274
00:11:23,080 --> 00:11:25,200
 Imagine it, but more like a cat.

275
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:27,000
 [LAUGHTER]

276
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,280
 Imagine pressing it together.

277
00:11:28,280 --> 00:11:29,880
 It sounds like a cat purring a bit.

278
00:11:29,880 --> 00:11:31,280
 Anyway, that's the noise it makes.

279
00:11:31,280 --> 00:11:32,800
 I think it does sound like a cat purring.

280
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:34,440
 Yeah, more than a dolphin, in fact.

281
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:35,760
 But that is very sped up, isn't it?

282
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:38,960
 So actually, it's like one of those noises every 20 minutes

283
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:41,840
 or something, the dolphin that clicks very infrequently.

284
00:11:41,840 --> 00:11:44,280
 And have we had to manufacture that sound?

285
00:11:44,280 --> 00:11:46,320
 Because it doesn't quite-- we can't send sound back,

286
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:48,640
 so they're picking up signals of what the sound should be

287
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:49,880
 generating.

288
00:11:49,880 --> 00:11:51,280
 That's a recreation.

289
00:11:51,280 --> 00:11:53,160
 That's someone in a-- that's like in TV

290
00:11:53,160 --> 00:11:55,280
 when you have to make boot sounds on the ground.

291
00:11:55,280 --> 00:11:56,760
 They're trying to do what?

292
00:11:56,760 --> 00:11:57,760
 Comet.

293
00:11:57,760 --> 00:11:59,320
 Oh, and that's-- that's another--

294
00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:00,520
 Get me a dolphin, yeah.

295
00:12:00,520 --> 00:12:02,560
 [LAUGHTER]

296
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:04,840
 [INAUDIBLE]

297
00:12:04,840 --> 00:12:05,840
 It's not quite that.

298
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:07,760
 They've copied and pasted the vibrations

299
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:10,600
 that are being emitted by the comet into radio waves

300
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:12,200
 so that we can hear them.

301
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:14,040
 They haven't just hired a cat.

302
00:12:14,040 --> 00:12:15,840
 [LAUGHTER]

303
00:12:15,840 --> 00:12:18,120
 Actually, doesn't it smell like cat pee?

304
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:19,600
 Yeah, it smells like cat pee.

305
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:21,640
 And it looks like a duck.

306
00:12:21,640 --> 00:12:25,160
 I'm wondering if this is a comet or something.

307
00:12:25,160 --> 00:12:27,120
 If it looks like a duck, sounds like a dolphin

308
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:29,440
 and a cat and smells like cat urine.

309
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:34,560
 It's Comet's 67P. Do you know we don't know if it changed?

310
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:35,920
 It's tuned, though.

311
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:37,600
 And so-- [LAUGHTER]

312
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:39,480
 So, Halley's Comet has been studied before,

313
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:40,800
 and it makes a completely different thing

314
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:43,680
 as a completely different song when it gets closer to the sun.

315
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:45,880
 And so we're still waiting on the dates to come back

316
00:12:45,880 --> 00:12:49,880
 as to whether the tune now sounds more like a duck or a giraffe

317
00:12:49,880 --> 00:12:51,200
 or whatever weird.

318
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:52,760
 And we want to compare it to--

319
00:12:52,760 --> 00:12:54,320
 Hey, speaking of Halley's Comet, do you

320
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:56,800
 know when the next time we're going to see Halley's Comet is?

321
00:12:56,800 --> 00:12:59,920
 Oh, well, the last one was when probably when I was a teenager,

322
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:04,000
 so it'll be another probably 45s, 0.6 years,

323
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,360
 something like that.

324
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:06,640
 October 20th.

325
00:13:06,640 --> 00:13:07,120
 Oh.

326
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:08,120
 Yeah.

327
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:10,920
 [LAUGHTER]

328
00:13:10,920 --> 00:13:16,760
 And I'm older than I think.

329
00:13:16,760 --> 00:13:21,280
 No, I've just got the word hubris in my notes here.

330
00:13:21,280 --> 00:13:24,240
 You could send me 50 birthday cards.

331
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:27,000
 I hope you liked him, found him.

332
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,560
 [LAUGHTER]

333
00:13:29,560 --> 00:13:32,760
 Now, what this is is that Halley's Comet, when it flies by,

334
00:13:32,760 --> 00:13:35,000
 it obviously leaves a trail behind it.

335
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,880
 And so on October 20th, we're going to come into the path

336
00:13:37,880 --> 00:13:40,840
 of the debris trail that it left behind when we saw it.

337
00:13:40,840 --> 00:13:43,600
 And so, if you're in the north of Wales, October 20th,

338
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:46,320
 and it lasts for quite a long time because it's a long trail,

339
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:48,120
 you'll see meteor showers coming in.

340
00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:50,840
 And you'll be able to watch the debris of Halley's Comet

341
00:13:50,840 --> 00:13:53,040
 coming in, and it happens every year.

342
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:54,080
 That is great.

343
00:13:54,080 --> 00:13:55,880
 I don't know if it counts as seeing a comet

344
00:13:55,880 --> 00:13:58,280
 if you're seeing what it's excreted as it's possible.

345
00:13:58,280 --> 00:14:01,080
 It's walking into a room two years after someone faster than it.

346
00:14:01,080 --> 00:14:03,280
 [LAUGHTER]

347
00:14:03,280 --> 00:14:05,080
 Terry, hi.

348
00:14:05,080 --> 00:14:06,640
 [LAUGHTER]

349
00:14:06,640 --> 00:14:10,440
 So this thing, with just back to the comet quickly,

350
00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:12,200
 they've discovered a lot of stuff.

351
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:15,360
 So, for example, they discovered a new kind of carbon,

352
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:17,600
 which was really complicated, not like the kind of carbon

353
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:18,920
 that we're made of.

354
00:14:18,920 --> 00:14:20,960
 And there was an interview with a team member

355
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:23,400
 of Resetta, a good Evie cotton.

356
00:14:23,400 --> 00:14:25,360
 He said, "It is so complex.

357
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:28,360
 We can't give it a proper formula or a name."

358
00:14:28,360 --> 00:14:30,520
 [LAUGHTER]

359
00:14:30,520 --> 00:14:31,920
 It's so complex.

360
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:33,920
 [LAUGHTER]

361
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:35,880
 They don't even need it.

362
00:14:35,880 --> 00:14:37,080
 Do they keep trying?

363
00:14:37,080 --> 00:14:37,960
 They're like, we'll call it--

364
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:40,960
 [LAUGHTER]

365
00:14:40,960 --> 00:14:43,720
 [INAUDIBLE]

366
00:14:43,720 --> 00:14:46,680
 And have we said why this is in the news this week?

367
00:14:46,680 --> 00:14:50,840
 Rosetta, which is the probe, which went around the comet,

368
00:14:50,840 --> 00:14:53,880
 it's crashed into the comet and it's the end of its life, isn't it?

369
00:14:53,880 --> 00:14:55,360
 It's not actually the end of its life.

370
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:57,920
 It's just cuss off its phone conversation with us.

371
00:14:57,920 --> 00:14:58,920
 Yeah.

372
00:14:58,920 --> 00:15:01,320
 It's kind of heubristic of us to assume that it's not dead.

373
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:02,080
 Well, that's true.

374
00:15:02,080 --> 00:15:04,760
 But you see, because it's like solar power, isn't it?

375
00:15:04,760 --> 00:15:08,440
 So they were thinking, well, maybe we could just kind of land

376
00:15:08,440 --> 00:15:10,800
 it softly, and then next time it goes near the sun,

377
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:12,200
 it can power up again.

378
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:14,120
 Well, they weren't sure if that was going to work.

379
00:15:14,120 --> 00:15:17,840
 And then so one of the scientists at the ESA, Matt Taylor,

380
00:15:17,840 --> 00:15:22,280
 said they'd rather go out in true rock and roll style

381
00:15:22,280 --> 00:15:23,680
 and crash into the comet.

382
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:26,400
 It's weird that he said that because they crashed into the comet

383
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:27,440
 two miles an hour.

384
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:29,720
 [LAUGHTER]

385
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:30,920
 That's walking pace.

386
00:15:30,920 --> 00:15:31,720
 That is walking pace.

387
00:15:31,720 --> 00:15:34,800
 It's rolled into a comet.

388
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:37,480
 The most interesting thing for me about the whole thing

389
00:15:37,480 --> 00:15:40,000
 is that we did find out amazing information

390
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,520
 about the makeup of comets and so on.

391
00:15:42,520 --> 00:15:44,920
 And they think that there might be bits of it

392
00:15:44,920 --> 00:15:48,640
 that suggest how life may have arrived on Earth.

393
00:15:48,640 --> 00:15:50,200
 But for me, what's really interesting

394
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:52,520
 is on the actual probe risetta,

395
00:15:52,520 --> 00:15:55,360
 they included a thing called the risetta disk.

396
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:57,920
 I don't know if you remember Voyager years and years ago

397
00:15:57,920 --> 00:16:01,480
 had a golden disk on it that had songs from Earth languages.

398
00:16:01,480 --> 00:16:02,760
 Yeah, it's languages.

399
00:16:02,760 --> 00:16:04,280
 Exactly.

400
00:16:04,280 --> 00:16:08,600
 So they've created a 7.5-centimeter nickel disk

401
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:10,960
 that has 1,000 languages on it.

402
00:16:10,960 --> 00:16:14,080
 It's basically its nickel, and you can use a microscope

403
00:16:14,080 --> 00:16:17,920
 to head in towards, and you can read a thousand languages.

404
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:20,880
 So for a second time, we've ceded the idea of language

405
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:24,000
 that may die very soon into the universe, which is quite cool.

406
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:24,840
 It would just sit there.

407
00:16:24,840 --> 00:16:27,840
 All the aliens that have just finished building a record player.

408
00:16:27,840 --> 00:16:29,040
 [LAUGHTER]

409
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:29,480
 Oh, great.

410
00:16:29,480 --> 00:16:32,080
 Finally, we can-- oh, wait, what's this for, man?

411
00:16:32,080 --> 00:16:34,600
 [LAUGHTER]

412
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:38,080
 Risetta took 116,000 photos on the mission,

413
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:41,160
 and it sent back 218 gigabytes of data.

414
00:16:41,160 --> 00:16:44,200
 I don't even say it sent back 218 of them.

415
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:45,440
 Like it's taken so far feet.

416
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:49,720
 No, no, no, no.

417
00:16:49,720 --> 00:16:51,360
 It sent back 218 gigabytes of data.

418
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:54,040
 And I worked out that what that would be

419
00:16:54,040 --> 00:16:57,960
 is 872 copies of the film Deep Impact.

420
00:16:57,960 --> 00:17:01,000
 [LAUGHTER]

421
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,080
 That's the only version I could find of the film Deep Impact

422
00:17:03,080 --> 00:17:04,480
 online was dubbed into Tamil.

423
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:07,640
 So it might be slightly more or fewer.

424
00:17:07,640 --> 00:17:10,720
 Speaking of Deep Impact, I was surprised

425
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:12,600
 that no one has got angry about the fact

426
00:17:12,600 --> 00:17:17,440
 so far that Risetta has gone into the actual comet,

427
00:17:17,440 --> 00:17:22,240
 because in 2005, NASA crashed their probe Deep Impact

428
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:25,400
 into a comet called Tempel-1, and an astrologer

429
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:27,400
 tried to sue NASA, saying that they

430
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:30,680
 had upset the balance of the universe.

431
00:17:30,680 --> 00:17:32,960
 Well, all of these horoscopes are bollocks now, aren't they?

432
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:34,960
 [LAUGHTER]

433
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:40,880
 OK, so we're halfway through the show,

434
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:42,960
 and it's time to look at the stories that you've sent

435
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:47,800
 into us via emails and social media, starting with James.

436
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:50,920
 OK, this one comes from a David Smith.

437
00:17:50,920 --> 00:17:55,440
 It's @dvdsmith on Twitter, and it comes from the independent.

438
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:58,520
 A Russian children's charity has had a million flyers

439
00:17:58,520 --> 00:18:03,480
 printed asking people to exterminate beavers.

440
00:18:03,480 --> 00:18:04,960
 That's due to a misprint.

441
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:06,640
 It should have read, do good.

442
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:10,960
 [LAUGHTER]

443
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:11,760
 Anna?

444
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:15,520
 This is a tweet from @iOfCever, and it comes from the Florida Sun

445
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:18,880
 Posts, and it's a story that a 68-year-old man who

446
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:21,400
 married a 24-year-old woman only to discover

447
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:23,640
 when looking through family photos that she's

448
00:18:23,640 --> 00:18:27,600
 a strange biological granddaughter said they have no plans

449
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:28,880
 to divorce.

450
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:30,760
 He said, "I've already had two failed marriages,

451
00:18:30,760 --> 00:18:35,080
 and I'm determined not to have a third."

452
00:18:35,080 --> 00:18:36,920
 And finally, Andy.

453
00:18:36,920 --> 00:18:39,240
 My fact has been sent in from Kenzie Lee.

454
00:18:39,240 --> 00:18:42,320
 An employee of the Canadian Mint is currently on trial accused

455
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:46,080
 of smuggling £100,000 worth of gold out of the building

456
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:48,360
 in his rectum.

457
00:18:48,360 --> 00:18:52,720
 He kept on setting off the metal detector when he was leaving.

458
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:54,880
 And they kept on doing a sort of pat down search.

459
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:56,240
 Nothing there, OK, well.

460
00:18:56,240 --> 00:18:58,880
 And then they found some gold pucks and a tub of Vaseline

461
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:00,640
 in his locker.

462
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:03,920
 And he maintains that this is completely circumstantial evidence

463
00:19:03,920 --> 00:19:04,920
 as well.

464
00:19:04,920 --> 00:19:09,040
 Anyway, here's the moment innocent until proven guilty.

465
00:19:09,040 --> 00:19:12,560
 Until proven really weird.

466
00:19:12,560 --> 00:19:16,640
 OK, it is time for fact number three, and that is James.

467
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:20,360
 OK, my fact this week is that Nobel Prize winners always

468
00:19:20,360 --> 00:19:23,800
 immediately return their award so they don't lose it

469
00:19:23,800 --> 00:19:25,160
 in the subsequent party.

470
00:19:25,160 --> 00:19:31,080
 This makes it sound like as soon as they get the award,

471
00:19:31,080 --> 00:19:33,320
 it kicks off.

472
00:19:33,320 --> 00:19:35,480
 So I think the key to the fun that they have,

473
00:19:35,480 --> 00:19:37,400
 because they definitely do have fun, is that.

474
00:19:37,400 --> 00:19:42,160
 They made sure that every year 200 of the 1,300 seats

475
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:45,160
 there are allocated to students from the uni.

476
00:19:45,160 --> 00:19:46,160
 Yes, so that's what it is.

477
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:47,960
 And a lot of the parties are led by students.

478
00:19:47,960 --> 00:19:51,360
 So the best part of the Nobel Prize ceremony, apparently,

479
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:53,840
 is the after party, and it's called Nobel Nightcap.

480
00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:57,040
 Do you know what they make the Nobel laureates do?

481
00:19:57,040 --> 00:19:59,040
 Shots.

482
00:19:59,040 --> 00:20:02,400
 They induct them into the order of the ever smiling

483
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:05,480
 and jumping green frog.

484
00:20:05,480 --> 00:20:08,080
 And everyone, like Richard Feynman, was a part of it.

485
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:10,000
 Richard Feynman was really excited because, as well,

486
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:13,720
 as playing the bongos, he's an amazing physicist.

487
00:20:13,720 --> 00:20:17,600
 Most people just know him as a bongo player.

488
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:19,320
 He was involved in science as well.

489
00:20:19,320 --> 00:20:21,080
 And yeah, and they gave him one of these awards.

490
00:20:21,080 --> 00:20:22,480
 And he was really excited because he

491
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:23,960
 does an awesome frog impression.

492
00:20:23,960 --> 00:20:26,560
 So he was like, oh, finally, can bust this out of this.

493
00:20:26,560 --> 00:20:27,360
 And it's not weird.

494
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:30,520
 And so what they do is they get people who've won the prizes,

495
00:20:30,520 --> 00:20:34,480
 usually in physics, to be-- they have to leap like a frog.

496
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:36,480
 And they also have a massive paper mache frog

497
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:38,480
 that they have to carry all the way back

498
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:40,120
 to the origin place of the frog.

499
00:20:40,120 --> 00:20:43,360
 So people who've just won the biggest award in science

500
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:47,880
 can be seen at 2 a.m. with a huge paper mache frog.

501
00:20:47,880 --> 00:20:49,880
 For real ones, it changes every year.

502
00:20:49,880 --> 00:20:51,360
 The formality is, and sometimes it's

503
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:53,720
 a person dressed up as a frog.

504
00:20:53,720 --> 00:20:55,160
 They mix it up all the time.

505
00:20:55,160 --> 00:20:56,320
 Of course, you say physics.

506
00:20:56,320 --> 00:20:58,480
 And it is the Nobel prizes this week, isn't it?

507
00:20:58,480 --> 00:20:59,000
 Yes.

508
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,880
 And the physics prize has just been won by three British people.

509
00:21:01,880 --> 00:21:02,560
 Yeah.

510
00:21:02,560 --> 00:21:04,080
 Which is great.

511
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:06,440
 So there is a lot of partying, and it is very fun.

512
00:21:06,440 --> 00:21:09,400
 But there also is the actual ceremony bit, which

513
00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:10,360
 is very serious.

514
00:21:10,360 --> 00:21:13,760
 And so all Nobel laureates get a course

515
00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:16,720
 in how to receive the actual prize from the king.

516
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:20,040
 So there was actually a British Nobel prize winner

517
00:21:20,040 --> 00:21:21,480
 called Paul Nurse.

518
00:21:21,480 --> 00:21:25,280
 And they use his video as an example of how not to accept it.

519
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:27,240
 He got his medal turned around and held it up

520
00:21:27,240 --> 00:21:30,680
 like he'd won the World Cup in football, a classic Brit.

521
00:21:30,680 --> 00:21:34,560
 And they edited that out from his winning video.

522
00:21:34,560 --> 00:21:38,120
 And they apparently show that in the demonstration

523
00:21:38,120 --> 00:21:40,360
 of how to receive it by how not to receive it.

524
00:21:40,360 --> 00:21:41,160
 He could have done worse.

525
00:21:41,160 --> 00:21:43,000
 He could have been, like, Kanut Hanson,

526
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:45,480
 who won the 1920 electric surprise.

527
00:21:45,480 --> 00:21:46,480
 You don't need to tell us, Jane.

528
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:49,480
 [LAUGHTER]

529
00:21:49,480 --> 00:21:51,480
 He got drunk and he pulled the whiskers

530
00:21:51,480 --> 00:21:54,800
 of an elderly Nobel committee man.

531
00:21:54,800 --> 00:21:57,440
 And then he snapped his finger against the corset

532
00:21:57,440 --> 00:22:00,840
 of his fellow laureates' secret unset and shouted,

533
00:22:00,840 --> 00:22:02,560
 "It sounds like a bellboy."

534
00:22:02,560 --> 00:22:05,240
 [LAUGHTER]

535
00:22:05,240 --> 00:22:07,960
 It was a different time.

536
00:22:07,960 --> 00:22:11,000
 So they give you the actual gold medal when you win.

537
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:12,800
 And for some reason, the economics one is very slightly

538
00:22:12,800 --> 00:22:14,600
 larger than all the other fights on the white.

539
00:22:14,600 --> 00:22:15,840
 It is 10 grams bigger, isn't it?

540
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:16,800
 10 grams, I don't know why.

541
00:22:16,800 --> 00:22:17,960
 No explanation.

542
00:22:17,960 --> 00:22:20,480
 But so there was a guy called Brian Schmidt,

543
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:23,000
 who won the 2011 prize for physics

544
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:25,200
 for discovering dark energy, basically.

545
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:26,720
 And he went to his granny.

546
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:28,920
 She lives in Fargo, made famous, obviously,

547
00:22:28,920 --> 00:22:30,720
 by the film and the TV series.

548
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:32,520
 And then on his way out at the airport,

549
00:22:32,520 --> 00:22:34,760
 it was in his laptop bag.

550
00:22:34,760 --> 00:22:37,800
 And it came up on the screen as this completely black disc

551
00:22:37,800 --> 00:22:38,920
 that's made of gold.

552
00:22:38,920 --> 00:22:41,480
 And the airport guys were a bit freaked out.

553
00:22:41,480 --> 00:22:43,360
 And he reported the conversation they had.

554
00:22:43,360 --> 00:22:46,000
 He said, they're like, sir, there's something in your bag.

555
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:47,640
 He said, yes, I think it's this box.

556
00:22:47,640 --> 00:22:49,120
 They said, what's in the box?

557
00:22:49,120 --> 00:22:52,400
 He said, a large gold medal.

558
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:54,800
 They opened it and they said, what's it made out of?

559
00:22:54,800 --> 00:22:58,440
 And he says, gold.

560
00:22:58,440 --> 00:23:01,960
 And then they said, who gave this to you?

561
00:23:01,960 --> 00:23:03,520
 And then he says, the king of Sweden.

562
00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:09,920
 They say, why did he give this to you?

563
00:23:09,920 --> 00:23:11,280
 And he says, because I help discover

564
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:13,160
 the expansion rate of the universe is accelerating.

565
00:23:13,160 --> 00:23:17,440
 At which point, they were beginning

566
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:18,680
 to lose their sense of humor.

567
00:23:21,680 --> 00:23:23,160
 And he tells them it's a Nobel Prize.

568
00:23:23,160 --> 00:23:26,120
 And he says, and their main question was, why were you in Fargo?

569
00:23:26,120 --> 00:23:30,640
 He could have saved a lot of problems

570
00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:32,200
 if he's smuggled it in his rectum.

571
00:23:32,200 --> 00:23:37,280
 It's big, though.

572
00:23:37,280 --> 00:23:38,840
 At least it's not the economics one.

573
00:23:38,840 --> 00:23:44,120
 As well as the medal, you obviously

574
00:23:44,120 --> 00:23:47,120
 get the massive cash prize.

575
00:23:47,120 --> 00:23:48,680
 Why is it like a million dollars?

576
00:23:48,680 --> 00:23:50,560
 Well, if fluctuates, I've read this article

577
00:23:50,560 --> 00:23:53,440
 where they talked about how people who've won the Nobel Prize,

578
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:56,200
 how scientists have spent the money that they've won.

579
00:23:56,200 --> 00:23:58,040
 One interesting one was Albert Einstein

580
00:23:58,040 --> 00:24:00,400
 who gave his money over to his first wife.

581
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:02,480
 He gave it in 1921.

582
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:03,360
 That's when he won it.

583
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:04,920
 But actually, he signed it over to her

584
00:24:04,920 --> 00:24:07,760
 when they were divorcing in 1919.

585
00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:09,960
 So he said, if I ever win the Nobel Prize,

586
00:24:09,960 --> 00:24:14,480
 you can have the money in the divorce and then he won it.

587
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:16,920
 And she got the money, which is amazing.

588
00:24:16,920 --> 00:24:18,000
 You know they have the banquet?

589
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:19,000
 Yeah.

590
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:20,440
 So the 1300 guest banquet is incredible.

591
00:24:20,440 --> 00:24:24,080
 And sometimes there's major goss from the banquet.

592
00:24:24,080 --> 00:24:26,760
 So I was trying to look for a scandal at the banquet.

593
00:24:26,760 --> 00:24:30,080
 And get this, guys.

594
00:24:30,080 --> 00:24:33,360
 This is according to the Svenska Dagbladet newspaper.

595
00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:36,520
 Last year, the biggest scandal was a minor faux pas,

596
00:24:36,520 --> 00:24:38,320
 which meant the king was last at his table

597
00:24:38,320 --> 00:24:40,480
 to be served the source for the main course.

598
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:46,720
 It's amazing when you get that inside scoop.

599
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:49,560
 Hey, in banquet gossip.

600
00:24:49,560 --> 00:24:51,160
 I have to say--

601
00:24:51,160 --> 00:24:55,800
 I don't think it's going to cap the source incident.

602
00:24:55,800 --> 00:24:56,400
 You're right.

603
00:24:56,400 --> 00:24:57,720
 It goes alongside it.

604
00:24:57,720 --> 00:25:00,040
 So there's this blog written by a former planning

605
00:25:00,040 --> 00:25:02,560
 secretary for the banquet, talking about the issues she

606
00:25:02,560 --> 00:25:03,360
 come up against.

607
00:25:03,360 --> 00:25:05,040
 And one of the things is a seating plan, which

608
00:25:05,040 --> 00:25:07,080
 is very difficult with 1,300 people.

609
00:25:07,080 --> 00:25:08,920
 So obviously, a lot of colleagues attend together,

610
00:25:08,920 --> 00:25:11,440
 because they're on the same science research group.

611
00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:13,240
 And she says, seating plans do sometimes

612
00:25:13,240 --> 00:25:16,080
 request that they be seated as far from their colleagues

613
00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:17,880
 as possible.

614
00:25:17,880 --> 00:25:18,960
 People who sit.

615
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:23,280
 There was one a few years ago where an American attendee,

616
00:25:23,280 --> 00:25:25,040
 and a Swedish attendee who didn't know each other,

617
00:25:25,040 --> 00:25:27,600
 were sat next to each other, and they're still married today.

618
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:29,400
 So that's nice.

619
00:25:29,400 --> 00:25:30,360
 So nice.

620
00:25:30,360 --> 00:25:33,000
 And there was one where one of the Nobel laureates

621
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:37,080
 invited his ex-wife and his wife, and apparently,

622
00:25:37,080 --> 00:25:39,560
 the Nobel committee received strict instructions

623
00:25:39,560 --> 00:25:41,640
 to seat the ladies as far apart as possible,

624
00:25:41,640 --> 00:25:44,560
 without any possibility of eye contacts.

625
00:25:44,560 --> 00:25:45,600
 Wow.

626
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:50,680
 Luckily, it was the peace prize.

627
00:25:50,680 --> 00:25:53,400
 OK, it is time for our final fact of the show.

628
00:25:53,400 --> 00:25:54,760
 And that is, my fact.

629
00:25:54,760 --> 00:25:58,760
 My fact this week is that two recently recovered stolen

630
00:25:58,760 --> 00:26:02,280
 vangoff paintings would buy you enough cocaine

631
00:26:02,280 --> 00:26:06,480
 that you could snort a continuous line from here to Moscow.

632
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:14,240
 And you'd still have a bit left over for when you get there.

633
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:17,760
 So the reason that we know this is that two,

634
00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:21,960
 you may have seen in the news this week, two very famously stolen

635
00:26:21,960 --> 00:26:25,040
 vangoff paintings, which were taken back in 2002

636
00:26:25,040 --> 00:26:27,920
 from the Vangoff Museum in Amsterdam were recovered.

637
00:26:27,920 --> 00:26:30,160
 And they were found in Italy, near Naples,

638
00:26:30,160 --> 00:26:34,920
 in the property of a famous cocaine mafia cartel.

639
00:26:34,920 --> 00:26:38,720
 And the idea is that they were using these paintings as currency.

640
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:42,280
 So we found out how much one vangoff would be worth.

641
00:26:42,280 --> 00:26:44,680
 We doubled it, and then we worked out how much cocaine

642
00:26:44,680 --> 00:26:46,360
 that would be equivalent to--

643
00:26:46,360 --> 00:26:47,680
 It's a shame that you have to make this swap,

644
00:26:47,680 --> 00:26:49,000
 because once you're given away the paintings,

645
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:53,360
 you've got nothing to snort the cocaine off of it.

646
00:26:53,360 --> 00:26:57,920
 Because that's the most rock 'n' roll moment of your life.

647
00:26:57,920 --> 00:27:00,120
 When these two paintings disappeared,

648
00:27:00,120 --> 00:27:04,880
 they actually found the people that they thought may have stolen it.

649
00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:07,320
 I mean, it's a guy sent-- there were two people sent to prison, weren't they?

650
00:27:07,320 --> 00:27:07,840
 Yes.

651
00:27:07,840 --> 00:27:10,160
 The main one was called Octave Durham.

652
00:27:10,160 --> 00:27:13,080
 And he was known to the police as the monkey,

653
00:27:13,080 --> 00:27:16,680
 because he was so good at evading arrest.

654
00:27:16,680 --> 00:27:18,280
 As monkeys are.

655
00:27:18,280 --> 00:27:20,600
 I'm going to try to slap the cuffs on the monkey.

656
00:27:20,600 --> 00:27:22,640
 They've got the little claws.

657
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:24,720
 I checked, and actually only two monkeys

658
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:26,080
 have been arrested in the last year.

659
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:37,840
 One was for harassing locals in Mumbai,

660
00:27:37,840 --> 00:27:42,720
 and the other was after a high-speed chase in Washington State.

661
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:45,400
 He was sitting on the back of the guy who was driving,

662
00:27:45,400 --> 00:27:48,880
 so it hardly seems fair, and they did let it go quite quickly afterwards.

663
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:50,680
 But still in the rest.

664
00:27:50,680 --> 00:27:52,400
 So they never recovered the paintings from them,

665
00:27:52,400 --> 00:27:55,320
 but they assumed it was them, because at the site,

666
00:27:55,320 --> 00:27:58,680
 they found their DNA on the ropes, on the ladders,

667
00:27:58,680 --> 00:28:02,840
 and on both hats that they left behind.

668
00:28:02,840 --> 00:28:04,640
 Like a monkey, where's that?

669
00:28:07,640 --> 00:28:10,320
 The banana peels everywhere.

670
00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:14,680
 So one of the things is that they got four years jail sentence,

671
00:28:14,680 --> 00:28:17,520
 and they were denying it, obviously, that they'd stolen it.

672
00:28:17,520 --> 00:28:19,640
 And they thought maybe the reason they hadn't admitted to it,

673
00:28:19,640 --> 00:28:21,600
 and probably played against them in the trial,

674
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:26,160
 is the fact that Dutch law states that if there is a stolen bit of art,

675
00:28:26,160 --> 00:28:29,560
 and it's missing for 30 years, whoever is in possession of it, owns it.

676
00:28:29,560 --> 00:28:32,440
 So they thought that they were going to wait 30 years,

677
00:28:32,440 --> 00:28:37,040
 and then go, oh, look what we found, and then legally, that's fine.

678
00:28:37,040 --> 00:28:38,760
 Incredible, isn't it, that that might be true?

679
00:28:38,760 --> 00:28:41,000
 Yeah. But they own it, but would they still go into prison

680
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:42,280
 for committing the crime?

681
00:28:42,280 --> 00:28:43,120
 Yeah, probably.

682
00:28:43,120 --> 00:28:44,280
 Well, they did the time, I guess.

683
00:28:44,280 --> 00:28:46,760
 They did the four years for the theft.

684
00:28:46,760 --> 00:28:51,160
 Apparently, all these old laws date from the time when Amsterdam

685
00:28:51,160 --> 00:28:54,920
 were massive parts where people could steal things and then just disappear.

686
00:28:54,920 --> 00:28:57,960
 And so they have a load of kind of slightly weird arcane laws

687
00:28:57,960 --> 00:28:59,440
 that still are on the statute books.

688
00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:00,120
 We have a law about that.

689
00:29:00,120 --> 00:29:02,560
 We have a Finders Keepers law, where if you find something

690
00:29:02,560 --> 00:29:06,280
 had been to the police, and a few weeks later, it's been unclamed,

691
00:29:06,280 --> 00:29:07,280
 you get it.

692
00:29:07,280 --> 00:29:09,040
 Is there a loser's weepers law?

693
00:29:09,040 --> 00:29:11,560
 [LAUGHTER]

694
00:29:11,560 --> 00:29:17,880
 There has been another development in art, theft news.

695
00:29:17,880 --> 00:29:21,680
 So the FBI has a top 10 art crimes list, which I didn't know.

696
00:29:21,680 --> 00:29:27,240
 And one of them is theft in 1990 from the Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum in Boston.

697
00:29:27,240 --> 00:29:30,560
 And this year, the FBI dug up the garden of a mafia boss,

698
00:29:30,560 --> 00:29:32,840
 called Roberto Gentile, to try to find it.

699
00:29:32,840 --> 00:29:34,840
 It didn't find any of the paintings that were missing.

700
00:29:34,840 --> 00:29:37,240
 And this is the evidence they've got against him.

701
00:29:37,240 --> 00:29:39,440
 He did a polygraph test, which assessed the likelihood

702
00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:41,120
 he was telling the truth about not being

703
00:29:41,120 --> 00:29:44,680
 involved at less than 0.1%.

704
00:29:44,680 --> 00:29:50,320
 He was found to have a handwritten list of the stolen artworks and their values.

705
00:29:50,320 --> 00:29:56,040
 And he was recorded telling an FBI agent he had two of the stolen paintings.

706
00:29:56,040 --> 00:29:58,280
 Well, this is the biggest ever art theft in the US.

707
00:29:58,280 --> 00:30:03,240
 And the way they did it is so movies star-style.

708
00:30:03,240 --> 00:30:05,920
 They dressed up as policemen, these two guys.

709
00:30:05,920 --> 00:30:08,040
 And they turned up and said to the security guards,

710
00:30:08,040 --> 00:30:12,000
 hey, we got a call about disturbance in this art gallery full of priceless things.

711
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:12,960
 Can we get in?

712
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:15,120
 And so the security guards let them in.

713
00:30:15,120 --> 00:30:19,640
 And then as soon as they'd been let in, they said, in your face, this is the robbery.

714
00:30:19,640 --> 00:30:21,560
 I think they did-- in fact, I think they were quite polite about it.

715
00:30:21,560 --> 00:30:22,240
 They did the classic thing.

716
00:30:22,240 --> 00:30:24,480
 They said, gentlemen, this is a robbery.

717
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:26,920
 And then tied them up and stole the stuff.

718
00:30:26,920 --> 00:30:29,440
 Kim Kardashian got robbed in Shibuya.

719
00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:32,520
 And they reckon that might have been the Pink Panther gang,

720
00:30:32,520 --> 00:30:34,760
 who apparently have lots of these kind of tricks.

721
00:30:34,760 --> 00:30:37,800
 Like, sometimes they get away on bikes, dressed as women,

722
00:30:37,800 --> 00:30:41,320
 and sometimes they get away in speedboats and one time,

723
00:30:41,320 --> 00:30:42,760
 so they didn't get spotted.

724
00:30:42,760 --> 00:30:45,880
 They put wet paint signs on all the benches nearby,

725
00:30:45,880 --> 00:30:47,200
 so no one would sit on them.

726
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:48,600
 And always with the theme tune.

727
00:30:48,600 --> 00:30:56,760
 There's-- I read an interesting story about art heists.

728
00:30:56,760 --> 00:31:00,920
 So there was a story about a guy who he was called Radu Dogara.

729
00:31:00,920 --> 00:31:05,440
 And he stole $26.38 million worth of art.

730
00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:07,120
 And so he was caught and he was going to trial.

731
00:31:07,120 --> 00:31:10,920
 And he said that he was willing to divulge where all of the art was.

732
00:31:10,920 --> 00:31:15,240
 The only condition was that he got a Dutch trial instead of a Romanian trial,

733
00:31:15,240 --> 00:31:19,240
 because it turns out that the laws are different in every different country

734
00:31:19,240 --> 00:31:22,440
 for how severe a sentence you get for stealing art.

735
00:31:22,440 --> 00:31:25,440
 And the Dutch laws are way less severe than they are in Romania,

736
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:26,720
 where they're extremely severe.

737
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:30,040
 So it's a difference between four years in jail or 20 years in jail.

738
00:31:30,040 --> 00:31:32,880
 So I looked for the best place to steal art from.

739
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:35,640
 [LAUGHTER]

740
00:31:35,640 --> 00:31:39,280
 And it turns out it's on Norwegian cruises.

741
00:31:39,280 --> 00:31:39,780
 OK.

742
00:31:39,780 --> 00:31:40,480
 Yeah.

743
00:31:40,480 --> 00:31:45,560
 So a guy, a Kentucky native, called Kevin Hudgens, he recently stole it.

744
00:31:45,560 --> 00:31:49,600
 It was a copy of a Rembrandt, still worth about $13,000 American dollars.

745
00:31:49,600 --> 00:31:53,080
 And he stole it, but he happened to steal it while the cruiser he was on,

746
00:31:53,080 --> 00:31:54,680
 docked in Bermuda.

747
00:31:54,680 --> 00:31:56,400
 And in Bermuda, they just don't care.

748
00:31:56,400 --> 00:31:57,720
 They're like, that's fine.

749
00:31:57,720 --> 00:32:02,760
 And his trial, because wherever the boat docks, that's where you are the law of.

750
00:32:02,760 --> 00:32:06,360
 And so he got fined $500 for stealing it.

751
00:32:06,360 --> 00:32:10,360
 As opposed to 20 years in jail, had he docked in Romania, for example.

752
00:32:10,360 --> 00:32:14,440
 So if you're on a cruise and there's a good bit of art, check out where you're docking.

753
00:32:14,440 --> 00:32:16,160
 Check out the cruise's Romania.

754
00:32:16,160 --> 00:32:17,160
 Yeah, exactly.

755
00:32:17,160 --> 00:32:20,360
 But if you're heading to Bermuda, have a look at the walls on the ship.

756
00:32:20,360 --> 00:32:21,600
 [LAUGHTER]

757
00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:24,760
 I mean, Romania is-- it's not completely like Mott,

758
00:32:24,760 --> 00:32:28,200
 but there's not that many cruises go there at all.

759
00:32:28,200 --> 00:32:31,560
 Has anyone else been researching cocaine news just quickly on that?

760
00:32:31,560 --> 00:32:34,440
 So this is a story from last week in Seattle.

761
00:32:34,440 --> 00:32:36,720
 The police got handed a suitcase, which had been lost.

762
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:41,520
 And they said, well, let's look inside and see if we can find any clues to whoever might have owned it.

763
00:32:41,520 --> 00:32:42,320
 They opened it up.

764
00:32:42,320 --> 00:32:47,880
 They found 31 bags of cocaine, a scale for all the cocaine.

765
00:32:47,880 --> 00:32:50,400
 Some marijuana, because you got bored of cocaine.

766
00:32:50,400 --> 00:32:51,920
 [LAUGHTER]

767
00:32:51,920 --> 00:32:55,480
 [LAUGHTER]

768
00:32:55,480 --> 00:32:58,840
 And a 19-year-old man's ID card and mobile phone.

769
00:32:58,840 --> 00:33:02,080
 [LAUGHTER]

770
00:33:02,080 --> 00:33:04,400
 A little while after this had been handed in,

771
00:33:04,400 --> 00:33:09,680
 a 19-year-old man approached police, saying he had lost his briefcase,

772
00:33:09,680 --> 00:33:13,040
 and he needed it back as it contained some extremely important paperwork.

773
00:33:13,040 --> 00:33:14,080
 [LAUGHTER]

774
00:33:14,080 --> 00:33:15,280
 Oh, man.

775
00:33:15,280 --> 00:33:18,640
 He was arrested because of all the cocaine.

776
00:33:18,640 --> 00:33:19,720
 [LAUGHTER]

777
00:33:19,720 --> 00:33:20,520
 Yeah.

778
00:33:20,520 --> 00:33:22,560
 I found one bit of cocaine news.

779
00:33:22,560 --> 00:33:24,800
 It's a study, a new study.

780
00:33:24,800 --> 00:33:28,800
 Scientists have found that cocaine makes fish feel drowsy.

781
00:33:28,800 --> 00:33:29,640
 [LAUGHTER]

782
00:33:29,640 --> 00:33:32,560
 Yeah, they gave some cocaine to some zebrafish.

783
00:33:32,560 --> 00:33:36,440
 And also, they can take 100 times more cocaine than mice can,

784
00:33:36,440 --> 00:33:39,360
 and 1,000 times more cocaine than humans can.

785
00:33:39,360 --> 00:33:40,280
 Wow.

786
00:33:40,280 --> 00:33:42,520
 What, but they're just blinking very, very fast.

787
00:33:42,520 --> 00:33:43,200
 [LAUGHTER]

788
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:44,080
 Slow.

789
00:33:44,080 --> 00:33:45,080
 I guess it's slowing down.

790
00:33:45,080 --> 00:33:46,080
 Yeah, it's slowing down.

791
00:33:46,080 --> 00:33:47,120
 Oh, yeah, of course.

792
00:33:47,120 --> 00:33:48,320
 It's sour.

793
00:33:48,320 --> 00:33:52,000
 There was another study on cocaine in the last week, actually.

794
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:53,520
 So, it runs out that.

795
00:33:53,520 --> 00:33:54,520
 [LAUGHTER]

796
00:33:54,520 --> 00:33:56,160
 It's not turning into cocaine news.

797
00:33:56,160 --> 00:33:58,040
 What's going to cocaine news?

798
00:33:58,040 --> 00:33:59,120
 [LAUGHTER]

799
00:33:59,120 --> 00:33:59,480
 Do you want news?

800
00:33:59,480 --> 00:34:00,480
 We got news.

801
00:34:00,480 --> 00:34:03,440
 [LAUGHTER]

802
00:34:03,440 --> 00:34:06,320
 The reason Andy's so anxious is that it's most likely

803
00:34:06,320 --> 00:34:09,360
 his cocaine is cut with a flesh-eating substance.

804
00:34:09,360 --> 00:34:14,800
 So 65% of cocaine in this country is now cut with this thing called levamisol,

805
00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:17,200
 which literally rot human flesh.

806
00:34:17,200 --> 00:34:19,040
 And so, yeah, I know, nice.

807
00:34:19,040 --> 00:34:22,720
 It's used by farmers to poach their livestock of parasitic worms, usually.

808
00:34:22,720 --> 00:34:25,760
 But it also serves this extra purpose.

809
00:34:25,760 --> 00:34:27,240
 But it keeps the weight off.

810
00:34:27,240 --> 00:34:28,400
 [LAUGHTER]

811
00:34:28,400 --> 00:34:29,400
 [APPLAUSE]

812
00:34:29,400 --> 00:34:34,880
 OK, that's it.

813
00:34:34,880 --> 00:34:35,960
 That's all of our facts.

814
00:34:35,960 --> 00:34:38,120
 Just time to share with you the four stories

815
00:34:38,120 --> 00:34:40,600
 that we didn't have time to get through during the show.

816
00:34:40,600 --> 00:34:42,240
 And we're going to start with mine.

817
00:34:42,240 --> 00:34:45,760
 My fact is that North Korea has banned sarcasm

818
00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:48,560
 because Tim Jong-un is worried that people

819
00:34:48,560 --> 00:34:50,800
 are only agreeing with him ironically.

820
00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:54,480
 [LAUGHTER]

821
00:34:54,480 --> 00:34:55,480
 James?

822
00:34:55,480 --> 00:34:57,880
 OK, mine is that the police in Utah

823
00:34:57,880 --> 00:35:01,520
 have officially recommended against shooting random clowns.

824
00:35:01,520 --> 00:35:04,960
 [LAUGHTER]

825
00:35:04,960 --> 00:35:08,080
 OK, Andy.

826
00:35:08,080 --> 00:35:09,720
 This is from the Times of India.

827
00:35:09,720 --> 00:35:12,120
 A building in Massachusetts had to be evacuated

828
00:35:12,120 --> 00:35:14,800
 after residents complained about a peculiar smell,

829
00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:17,920
 which turned out to be caused by a man cooking urine in his flat.

830
00:35:17,920 --> 00:35:21,880
 [LAUGHTER]

831
00:35:21,880 --> 00:35:23,360
 Finally, Anna.

832
00:35:23,360 --> 00:35:26,320
 Yep, this is from the National Post of Canada.

833
00:35:26,320 --> 00:35:29,040
 And this is after the official opening of a ring road

834
00:35:29,040 --> 00:35:31,360
 in Edmonton, Canada on Saturday,

835
00:35:31,360 --> 00:35:35,000
 murderous were surprised by a large electronic sign announcing,

836
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:36,240
 we done, bitches.

837
00:35:36,240 --> 00:35:39,200
 [LAUGHTER]

838
00:35:39,200 --> 00:35:44,240
 That's all from me, Andy James and Anna.

839
00:35:44,240 --> 00:35:45,600
 We'll be back again next week.

840
00:35:45,600 --> 00:35:47,080
 We've been No Such Thinkers and News.

841
00:35:47,080 --> 00:35:48,560
 Good night.

842
00:35:48,560 --> 00:35:51,480
 [APPLAUSE]

843
00:35:51,480 --> 00:35:54,840
 [MUSIC PLAYING]

844
00:35:54,840 --> 00:35:55,840
 (audience cheering)
