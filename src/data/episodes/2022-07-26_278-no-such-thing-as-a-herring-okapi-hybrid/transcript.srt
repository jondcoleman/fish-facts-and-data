00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:24,000
 Hello and welcome to another episode of no such thing as a fish, a weekly podcast coming to you from the QI offices in Covent Garden.

10
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:31,000
 I'm Dan Schreiber, I'm sitting here with Anish Zenski, Andrew Hunter Murray, James Harkin and exciting special guest.

11
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:36,000
 It is the pod father himself, Richard Herring, who is joining us.

12
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:41,000
 We're very excited to have him here, doubly excited because we got the chance to go on his show.

13
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:47,000
 Richard Herring's Lester Square Theatre podcast, which will be going out next week, the 24th of July.

14
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:51,000
 If you're listening to it, as this show goes out this Friday, it's a week from now.

15
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:56,000
 If not, find the 24th of July for Richard Herring and so much more.

16
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
 I mean, you're going to be doing the podcast in Edinburgh.

17
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:02,000
 Yeah, I'm at the Edinburgh Fringe at the Newtown Theatre, 130, pretty much every day throughout the Fringe.

18
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:07,000
 And I'm off on tour around the country in the autumn and probably onwards, beyond into 2020, I think.

19
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,000
 So yeah, go to richhane.com/gigs and you can find out where I'm coming.

20
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:14,000
 Amazing, and most importantly of all, you've got a fact.

21
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,000
 So we're going to start off with fact number one, and that is Richard Herring.

22
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:27,000
 Here's my fact. Adolf Hitler had size 13 feet, which I discovered this week on my own podcast,

23
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:31,000
 because I'm obsessed with the film The Cobbler, what's that?

24
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
 Adam Sandler, yeah.

25
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,000
 In which Adam Sandler inherits a magical cobbling machine.

26
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:40,000
 If you're interested in this, just listen to any of Richard's podcasts.

27
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,000
 In which?

28
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:45,000
 In which, if he puts on the feet of the shoes of someone whose shoes have been cobbled on that machine,

29
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:48,000
 he turns into that person, which is fine.

30
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,000
 So I asked people who they would turn into, but you've got to have the same size feet.

31
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:54,000
 So it's quite a hard question to answer unless you know.

32
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,000
 Especially for Adolf Hitler.

33
00:01:55,000 --> 00:02:00,000
 Yeah, well, my guest said, you know, who knows how big was Adolf Hitler's feet, for example.

34
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:04,000
 And we didn't know, but then someone Googled it, and it was size 13, which just seems...

35
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,000
 It seems big.

36
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:10,000
 Massive for what I thought was a very short man, but he's five foot, eight, five foot nine.

37
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:15,000
 I'm like 165 centimeters, but size 13 is like gigantic.

38
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,000
 Yeah.

39
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,000
 Stephen Fry has size 13 feet.

40
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,000
 Doesn't he?

41
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,000
 And he's what, six foot six?

42
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,000
 And something like that.

43
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
 Usain Bolt, he has size 13 feet.

44
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,000
 Is he tall?

45
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,000
 Usain Bolt.

46
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,000
 Yeah.

47
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,000
 Famously, yeah.

48
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,000
 Is he?

49
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,000
 Yeah.

50
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,000
 It's hard to tell because they're just so fast.

51
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,000
 You can't see that.

52
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:34,000
 Well, Meg Ryan, who is, I believe, the same height as Hitler, five foot eight.

53
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:37,000
 I don't think that's the brush we can tar her with.

54
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:40,000
 It's on her CV, it's the top line.

55
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
 I believe I'm right, saying she's five foot eight.

56
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,000
 And she has big feet.

57
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
 She's got 11, she's where it's size 11.

58
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,000
 Oh, wow.

59
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,000
 Yeah.

60
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,000
 That's huge.

61
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,000
 Is that a US 11?

62
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,000
 Yeah, we'll be.

63
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,000
 Hang on, that's completely different.

64
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,000
 I take back a lot of my friends.

65
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,000
 Is the US 11?

66
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:57,000
 Well, I don't know if the adult Hitler 13 is US or English.

67
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,000
 Isn't there somewhere?

68
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:01,000
 Isn't the USA or Europe, whether in the 40s?

69
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,000
 That's Europe.

70
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,000
 That's Europe, isn't it?

71
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:06,000
 I think the American size is about one different.

72
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,000
 So they're 0.5 or one different.

73
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
 OK, but what a Hitler size feet is in the European measurement.

74
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
 And actually, they were like pins.

75
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
 That's a really good point.

76
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,000
 Yeah.

77
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
 Yeah, actually, Rich, what is your sauce for this fact?

78
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,000
 Well, Google.

79
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,000
 OK.

80
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,000
 But then Google just says you were one size round of it.

81
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,000
 It says 13.

82
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
 One says 13 and a half.

83
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,000
 OK.

84
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:30,000
 And then I found a 56-page medical report from the CIA

85
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:35,000
 that was based on the doctor who had seen Hitler over from 1936

86
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,000
 to his death.

87
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
 And it had a lot of facts on it.

88
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,000
 And I read most.

89
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,000
 Did you say how many balls he had?

90
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:43,000
 Well, that was interested to look into that.

91
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:46,000
 And it says there's nothing wrong with his genitalia, which is...

92
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,000
 He had a farting problem from that medical report, as I could tell.

93
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
 Yeah, he was very flatulent.

94
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,000
 Was he?

95
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,000
 A gastro-problems in his tummy.

96
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
 It's a thorough inflammation he had as well.

97
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
 So he had a very blocked nose.

98
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
 Oh, what should he do?

99
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,000
 No.

100
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
 No, I don't think we're making that noise.

101
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,000
 No, yeah.

102
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,000
 He's not that Hitler.

103
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,000
 Poor old Hitler.

104
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,000
 He was...

105
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
 I did his BMI in 1936.

106
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:11,000
 He came out at 22.5, which is a pretty good BMI.

107
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,000
 Oh, I think that's...

108
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,000
 I think that's my BMI.

109
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,000
 Yeah, you got the same as Hitler.

110
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
 It's not the top line of your CB, though.

111
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,000
 I'm afraid it is.

112
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
 But it's kind of weird, because you start...

113
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
 I started looking up the historical figures.

114
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
 And you can't find anyone's foot size.

115
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
 It's something that's not really recorded very...

116
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,000
 Yeah, you're right.

117
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:29,000
 You can find celebrities sometimes if they've got big or small feet.

118
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,000
 Yeah, that's...

119
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:33,000
 You try to look up a lot of celebrity foot sizes,

120
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
 and you just found a load of fetish sites.

121
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:38,000
 Well, there are lots of people who have these websites

122
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
 where they're interested in celebrities' feet.

123
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,000
 And I wish you...

124
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
 Well, how your voice slightly dropped when you said that.

125
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:46,000
 Well, I'm not embarrassed.

126
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:51,000
 I was reading about celebrity shoes,

127
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,000
 and there's a little theory.

128
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:56,000
 So I don't know if we can class Hitler in the celebrity bracket.

129
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
 Yeah, we can put him in there, right?

130
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
 So, celebrities when they go...

131
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
 He's not going on celebrity, you know...

132
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,000
 Get me out of here.

133
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,000
 Hey, buddy, wood, now, that's the point.

134
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:07,000
 All those that kind of level of politician,

135
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
 that's the way they become successfully would be all over them.

136
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
 Do you think it's like the "Hurry Red" now?

137
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:14,000
 I think he's like an "Widdicum" of his day.

138
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:18,000
 Yeah, so I think that I read that certain celebrities do

139
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,000
 when they're going on the red carpet,

140
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:22,000
 is they often wear much larger shoes than their foot size.

141
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:25,000
 That's a common thing in Hollywood, because...

142
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
 Well, often when you're going out, you're wearing new shoes, aren't you?

143
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,000
 And you haven't broken them in.

144
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
 So if you're wearing a shoe that fits your foot perfectly,

145
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:33,000
 you're going to get blisters, you're going to mess up your feet.

146
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
 So when you're on the red carpet, there's often photos,

147
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:38,000
 there's celebrities who've got huge gaps at the back of their heels,

148
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
 if it's a woman wearing heels.

149
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,000
 What? No.

150
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
 People just fall off constantly on the red carpet.

151
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
 It's all an episode of Cinderella.

152
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
 Every time someone walks down it.

153
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:50,000
 It's just... It's J-Lo, does it? Yeah, it's a thing.

154
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
 No. It's a thing.

155
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
 Wow. Okay, apparently you know I...

156
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
 The more you say it, the more likely it will be to be true.

157
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:59,000
 If there are any celebrities out there, please write in a lettuce note.

158
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
 If there are no celebrities listening to this show.

159
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:04,000
 No, that's absolutely right and quite right from them.

160
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:07,000
 There are feet are getting bigger, apparently,

161
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:11,000
 which I find really weird, but there was a survey done in 1951, I think,

162
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:15,000
 and it looked into people's shoe sizes, as well as other stuff.

163
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:19,000
 And apparently the average shoe size for a woman then was size three,

164
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:23,000
 which is insane, because I don't know any women with size three feet.

165
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
 Kylie Minogue. Kylie Minogue.

166
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
 I don't know her, though.

167
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,000
 She's probably listening, though.

168
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
 So is it true that we're evolving that way,

169
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:34,000
 because maybe only big-fotted women are having sex and having children?

170
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:37,000
 Yeah, big-fotted women became incredibly sexy in the late 50s.

171
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,000
 Yeah.

172
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
 And yeah, we bred out the small-footed ones.

173
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
 It was a great triumph.

174
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:47,000
 The theory is the explanation I read is that we're getting fatter.

175
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:51,000
 And so we're pushing ourselves down on our feet and we're flattening our arms.

176
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,000
 No, it is true.

177
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:55,000
 It is to do with body size, increasing, they think.

178
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
 I actually think those studies must have also been flawed,

179
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:00,000
 because I don't believe shoe sizes have gone up three sizes.

180
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
 So now the average for a girl is size six.

181
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:06,000
 But it's not like we've all got tiny skeleton feet, a massive, flabby fat on them.

182
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
 It's not about the fatness.

183
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
 It's about the arch being pressed down.

184
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
 It's sort of squeezed out a bit.

185
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
 So you do get, you get wider feet, as well, for example.

186
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:17,000
 And also, the other reason is better nutrition.

187
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:20,000
 If you're a child and you have better nutrition, you will just be bigger.

188
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:23,000
 And that means your feet will be bigger, as well.

189
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,000
 You will like this.

190
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:27,000
 One retailer called it Bigfoot Britain.

191
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,000
 Nice.

192
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,000
 That is very cool.

193
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:34,000
 I did do some, I got sidetracked doing Bigfoot research while I was actually doing that.

194
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,000
 The links came up.

195
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,000
 I had to read it, you know.

196
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
 The investigation continues.

197
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:41,000
 Wait, does Bigfoot actually have big feet?

198
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,000
 Yeah, hence his name.

199
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
 Well, I've never actually pictured his feet.

200
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
 Does he have a big feet for a Bigfoot?

201
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,000
 That's the question.

202
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:50,000
 In the 50s, Bigfoot was just called foot.

203
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,000
 Foot.

204
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000
 Yeah.

205
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,000
 Do you know who had the biggest feet of all time?

206
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,000
 No.

207
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:59,000
 It's the tallest man of all time who was called Robert Wadlow.

208
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:05,000
 He had size 37 or 36 UK size feet.

209
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:10,000
 He had real problems finding shoes, obviously, because he was the only person in the world with this size shoes.

210
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
 And he...

211
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:16,000
 He's imagining him walking past a clock's sale, thinking, maybe this time.

212
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:21,000
 Well, when he was at high school, he wanted to play sport.

213
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:26,000
 He wanted to play basketball, because he thought he could stand next to the hoop and just put his hand over the hoop.

214
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
 He'd start anyone from scarring.

215
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:32,000
 But he couldn't get training shoes made quickly enough so he could never play.

216
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,000
 I was just speaking of growing.

217
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:37,000
 When he's only standing by the thing, he doesn't just put it up just very often.

218
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
 But some socks.

219
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:43,000
 Is there a rule that says you had to learn shoes that must be.

220
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:49,000
 That must be where they're building, making those shoes in order to have that guy blocking them.

221
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:52,000
 It's such a good week and we can win every game.

222
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
 There could be some six-year-old.

223
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:57,000
 At worst, he's going to be nil-bil.

224
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
 Yeah, you'd squeeze your feet in.

225
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,000
 He should have done an ugly sister.

226
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
 You can bend them over.

227
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,000
 And not apparently most people do.

228
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:09,000
 Service always say that something like 40% of women say they wear smaller shoes and they should.

229
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:13,000
 Which again, I'm very skeptical about because I don't really know anyone who doesn't wear their shoe size.

230
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:18,000
 But do they just claim that their shoes are smaller than they are to seem more dainty?

231
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:23,000
 No, because they're saying I've got big feet, but I'm wearing small shoes and it's really painful.

232
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:27,000
 I can't go to a shop and say I'm size three and they're just shoving it on.

233
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
 Are you sure? No, no, definitely three.

234
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
 Well, they do that as the idea because people are embarrassed.

235
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:34,000
 So apparently you reach a ceiling at nine as a woman.

236
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
 I don't know what it is as a man.

237
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:41,000
 And however large your feet are above that, you just go for a size nine because it's too embarrassing.

238
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,000
 So a lot of people are angry.

239
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
 I think men just like to have bigger feet, don't they?

240
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:47,000
 They pretend that they're bigger because it's more masculine to have bigger feet.

241
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
 Because of that fictional correlation thing.

242
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:55,000
 Yes, it's really interesting because I sort of vaguely assume that there was something in the foot size to penis size thing.

243
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:58,000
 And lots of studies have just found nothing.

244
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
 No correlation, rather.

245
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:05,000
 There's nothing there.

246
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:11,000
 It's all based on studies where, so for example, the study of a hundred and four men by a university college London.

247
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:15,000
 They measured penises when both soft and gently stretched.

248
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,000
 And they found no correlation.

249
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:21,000
 I actually measured my penis somewhat of those shoe size pieces.

250
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:24,000
 What do you think you're good for?

251
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:29,000
 You've been kicked out of so many quarks, branches.

252
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:34,000
 Okay, who around this table would go back in time to kill Hitler if you could?

253
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
 Anyone?

254
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,000
 And you would or not?

255
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,000
 Yes, I would.

256
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:41,000
 I wouldn't because I understand the butterfly effect.

257
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
 If you killed him, none of us would exist.

258
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:46,000
 Yeah, I read a pen out a novel where this was for you.

259
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:49,000
 None of the novels don't get me into alternate histories.

260
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,000
 None of them work.

261
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:57,000
 If you change one thing in history, certainly that long ago, of that magnitude especially, then nobody is the same.

262
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,000
 Nobody so life now would be alive.

263
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
 Because different people would have hooked up.

264
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,000
 Different people would be alive and dead.

265
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,000
 There'd be different children.

266
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,000
 None of us would be here.

267
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:09,000
 Because my parents both met up over the love of Hitler.

268
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:12,000
 Yeah, they were both buying Nazi memorabilia, weren't they?

269
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:17,000
 Because how many people went to war in the Second World War with one partner who then ended up having children with someone else?

270
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,000
 Because they were dead.

271
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,000
 That's the first thing.

272
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:24,000
 But even if you meet someone a day after or have sex two minutes later, that's a different person coming out.

273
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,000
 Yes, true.

274
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:30,000
 I just don't think that this podcast is about discussing these huge philosophical questions you've posed, James.

275
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,000
 Okay, well, can I tell you my facts?

276
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,000
 I'm already getting tweeted out.

277
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,000
 Yeah.

278
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:38,000
 So the fact is that men are more likely than women to say that they'll go back to kill Hitler.

279
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:45,000
 And the reason according to psychologists is men prefer utilitarian ideas and women prefer the ontological arguments.

280
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:48,000
 So men are more likely to do things that help everyone.

281
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:53,000
 And women are more likely to think, well, actually there are moral reasons why I shouldn't do this particular thing.

282
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,000
 Never mind in what the outcome is.

283
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,000
 Yeah, so it's always baby Hitler.

284
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:01,000
 You go back and kill a bit Hitler as a baby and women are going to go, no, I'm not going to do that.

285
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:04,000
 Was I think a few men would like to mind killing a baby?

286
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
 Sorry, can I clarify? I'm not in that category.

287
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:12,000
 I would go back and honorably challenge Hitler when he was at his absolute physical peak.

288
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:15,000
 What are you going to do?

289
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:20,000
 How old would you let Hitler get to before you kill him?

290
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:24,000
 I'd say after his First World War service, I would say.

291
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
 And then it's probably too late because then the Nazi party.

292
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:30,000
 I think you should aim for probably when you could just about beat him at your current.

293
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
 So maybe when he's about 14.

294
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
 Come on.

295
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
 Or how can you compete 14 year old Hitler?

296
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:39,000
 It was pretty weak. He's an age where you couldn't breathe properly.

297
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:42,000
 Yeah, with those feet though. He just crushed you.

298
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,000
 Exactly.

299
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:49,000
 Sorry, just to clarify, I would actually like to go back to Weimar Germany and improve the social and economic conditions.

300
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:55,000
 To the point at which Hitler had no grievance to exploit in the German fight.

301
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,000
 Such a shame, I'm going to cut this out.

302
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:05,000
 Hitler was very unfashionable, apparently.

303
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:09,000
 So I was looking to his clothes, starting with shoes and working my way up.

304
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:13,000
 He was in 1946, so I was going to say he was very unfashionable.

305
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,000
 He was quite unfashionable.

306
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,000
 I'd argue he's still out of fashion a little bit.

307
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:20,000
 Yeah, his reputation would never come back, has it?

308
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:24,000
 He, even in his day, didn't wear very fashionable clothes.

309
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:29,000
 So he had a sort of personal valet or valet, who disbared off him, apparently.

310
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:37,000
 This is a really weird account from the valet of trying to dress Hitler and saying that he'd lay out new clothes for him every day that would suit him.

311
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,000
 And then Hitler always refused to wear them.

312
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:46,000
 But then weirdly, Nazi chic, as in wearing Nazi clothes, is a thing that's not outrageous in some parts of the world.

313
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:52,000
 So I didn't realise this in parts of Asia, so in Thailand, sometimes it gets to the news here that someone's got in trouble in Thailand,

314
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:56,000
 because a class of school children will be wearing SS uniforms.

315
00:13:56,000 --> 00:14:00,000
 And it does happen, and it doesn't have the same associations there as it does here.

316
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:04,000
 And there was an interview with someone in Thailand, I think, saying it's not really taught as an ideology.

317
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:07,000
 It's taught as an objective piece of history.

318
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:10,000
 And so Nazi outfits have become fancy dress.

319
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,000
 So it's fancy dress, yeah?

320
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,000
 Yeah.

321
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:17,000
 Whereas they wouldn't wear a Mao Zedong hat, that would be very upsetting.

322
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,000
 I used to wear that in Sydney.

323
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,000
 What? Hitler clothes?

324
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,000
 No, not Hitler clothes.

325
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:25,000
 We were only in Sydney last year.

326
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:28,000
 Who do you think you are, Prince Harry?

327
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:35,000
 When I did a trip back to China when I was 18, I bought in Tiananmen Square one of those Mao communist hats.

328
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:38,000
 Jesus Christ, that is a whole combination of bad things.

329
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,000
 You shouldn't have done that.

330
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:46,000
 I know. And I, well, this is what's worse. I went canvassing for the Labour Party just before I left the country to move here.

331
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,000
 And it was a really hot day, and they only had one hat.

332
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:51,000
 So I wore that hat while I was handing out the leaflets.

333
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:54,000
 And, yeah, they asked me to stop.

334
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,000
 They haven't been in power since then.

335
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,000
 I can't picture the Mao Zedong hat.

336
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:01,000
 It's a green little army hat with the red star on it.

337
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,000
 Okay, I do know the one you mean, yeah, yeah.

338
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:07,000
 No, no, it's not like I love Mao Zedong kind of cap.

339
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:12,000
 The SS uniforms don't say, "I hear Hitler." That wasn't the uniform.

340
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:16,000
 I had a Hitler mustache for a year, or a toothbrush mustache for a year.

341
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:20,000
 That was the first time I ever saw you. It was the one I got news for you just looking like Hitler.

342
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,000
 Yeah, why was that again?

343
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:26,000
 Well, I was trying to reclaim the mustache for comedy because Charlie Chapman had it before Hitler.

344
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:32,000
 And I was just interested in why that symbol has taken the brunt of Hitler's disapproval.

345
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:37,000
 There was lots of things he did for having a BMI of 22 point wherever there wasn't that.

346
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,000
 You're not in trouble for that.

347
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:43,000
 And that mustache was very popular before Hitler, and Hitler obviously popularized it as well.

348
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,000
 A lot of comedians had it first.

349
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,000
 So I was sort of just interested in the symbolism of it.

350
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:50,000
 But then I also then had it for a year, which was a disconcerting.

351
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:53,000
 Did you get very bad reactions from some people?

352
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:58,000
 Not really. The worst thing that happened, I mean most people laughed at you just the second you'd passed.

353
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:04,000
 A few people looked a bit shocked and upset. But the worst thing that happened was I was an old and chepper's bush green

354
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:07,000
 at about midnight one night walking along and a man was coming out of a white van.

355
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:12,000
 He saw me and went, "Well, I'll make you a man after my own heart," which was just chilling.

356
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:18,000
 Like, you know, he was sort of going, "If only I was as brave as you, I would display my Nazism on my face."

357
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,000
 Well, then he was a Charlie Chaplin fan.

358
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:23,000
 He could have been, so you know. That's it. It was all about not making assumptions.

359
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:27,000
 But this show was about the importance of voting and an attempt to stop the rise of right wing politics.

360
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:30,000
 So, you know, I'm glad comedy works so well.

361
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:34,000
 He's just reminded everyone of what they were missing.

362
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:45,000
 Okay, it is time for fact number two and that is Chuzinski.

363
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:49,000
 My father's week is that in the Indigenous and Mexican language of Chalcatonga Mixtech,

364
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:52,000
 it is impossible to ask anyone a question.

365
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:55,000
 How did the translation of your emergency questions go down there?

366
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:59,000
 I didn't sell any kind of copies out there and now it's explained.

367
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:02,000
 That's what it is. Okay, explain.

368
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:06,000
 This is the... Sorry, was that a... That was a question.

369
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,000
 That explains, isn't it?

370
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,000
 It wasn't meant to be so aggressive.

371
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,000
 So, Anna, why don't you tell us what you mean?

372
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:12,000
 Yeah, there was an order.

373
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:15,000
 So, these are researchers at a place or a company called Idebonne,

374
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,000
 which is a language processing company,

375
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:23,000
 and they sort of coded applied code to 239 languages to look at how they worked.

376
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:27,000
 So, to look at things like how you order subjects and objects and verbs

377
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:33,000
 and how a language makes clear things like an order or a negative or a positive or a question.

378
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:39,000
 And Chalcatonga Mixtech is spoken by about 6,000 people in Mexico

379
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:44,000
 and it was determined to be the most unusual language in the world.

380
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:48,000
 So, it shares fewer things with any other languages than any other languages

381
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:51,000
 and there was no mechanism for showing you asking a question.

382
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:55,000
 There's no way of saying, are you all right, as opposed to, you're all right?

383
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:57,000
 But there's also.

384
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:01,000
 There's no difference between saying, are you all right and you are all right?

385
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,000
 Yeah, you're a bit of all right.

386
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:06,000
 They're not actually cracking onto each other constantly.

387
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,000
 I was just trying to sex it up.

388
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:11,000
 But there's no way. There's no way of saying to someone,

389
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:14,000
 do you fancy a drink? Would you like to get married?

390
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,000
 And then would you like to have some children,

391
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:19,000
 which is presumably why only 6,000 people in the world speak it?

392
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:21,000
 Yeah, you have to just kind of...

393
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,000
 Do you, Andrew Hunter Murray, take this one?

394
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,000
 Sorry, I don't know what it's all about.

395
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:28,000
 It's very demanding because it's always, it would all be you fancy a drink.

396
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:29,000
 You want to marry me.

397
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:30,000
 Yeah.

398
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:35,000
 So, just, the only people who are getting married are very aggressive men and very polite women.

399
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,000
 Okay, I agree.

400
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:41,000
 Why can't they just go up at the end of the statement to make a question?

401
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:42,000
 That's why can't they?

402
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:45,000
 I know they do tones, but that's, I mean, the problem in the UK

403
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,000
 is that people do that with non-questions now, don't they?

404
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:48,000
 Yeah.

405
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,000
 You're going, yeah.

406
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,000
 Just everything goes up at the end of the sentence.

407
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,000
 But that would be the solution for these people to be able to ask questions.

408
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,000
 But I guess it's not a problem.

409
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,000
 I guess they could.

410
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,000
 They don't mind.

411
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:58,000
 They don't want to ask questions.

412
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,000
 They don't want to know.

413
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:00,000
 They're very uncurious, they do.

414
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,000
 There must be one question in the need, which is,

415
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,000
 are you asking or are you telling?

416
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:04,000
 That's the question.

417
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:08,000
 That's made for them.

418
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:11,000
 All you need, you're right.

419
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:16,000
 But that's one of the things which makes English so weird is that we flip order to make a question.

420
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:17,000
 Yes.

421
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:18,000
 It is true.

422
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:19,000
 Is it true?

423
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:20,000
 Yeah.

424
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:23,000
 And then Japanese has, for example, the word you just add, you just add a particle.

425
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:25,000
 And that is a magical transforming particle.

426
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:28,000
 So, car is that in Japanese.

427
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,000
 So, so does car means, is that so?

428
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,000
 Yeah.

429
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:32,000
 And that's multiple common, isn't it?

430
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,000
 Yeah, yeah.

431
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,000
 So, I think only 2% of languages do the word switching.

432
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:36,000
 Right.

433
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,000
 Dutch is another one, very unusual.

434
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,000
 So, we are quite special in that way.

435
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:41,000
 Yeah.

436
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,000
 Do you know what the second least weird language is?

437
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:44,000
 Least weird.

438
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:45,000
 Yeah.

439
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:47,000
 So, the most normal after Hindi.

440
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:48,000
 Hindi is the most normal.

441
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,000
 I'll say Welsh.

442
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:52,000
 There's a language called 'purepecha', which is another Mexican language.

443
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:56,000
 And the third least weird language to the third most normal language.

444
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:57,000
 I'll say Welsh.

445
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:00,000
 It's, yeah, you're going to keep firing, are you?

446
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,000
 I'm going to be Mexican, Mexican, Mexican.

447
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,000
 I'm rather than Wales, actually.

448
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,000
 I'm afraid it's 'I' new.

449
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:09,000
 Which we've talked about before, but we've spoken by about 10 people.

450
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,000
 That's Japanese.

451
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:13,000
 That's Japanese and Hokkaido in Japan.

452
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:17,000
 So, that's one of the most normal languages spoken by about 10 people.

453
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:20,000
 I know Hindi is the most normal language, and that's spoken by what?

454
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:21,000
 Nearly a billion people.

455
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:22,000
 Yeah.

456
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:23,000
 Yeah.

457
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:29,000
 Hindi has one unusual feature that they found, and that is something called 'predictive possessions'.

458
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:35,000
 So, you can say 'Anna has a glass of wine', or you can say 'the glass of wine is 'Anna's',

459
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:38,000
 but you can't say 'Anna's glass of wine' in Hindi.

460
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:41,000
 You kind of have the possessive, I think.

461
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:43,000
 That's the only thing that's weird in Hindi.

462
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:46,000
 Have you guys heard of the Indonesian Riau dialect?

463
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:47,000
 Nope.

464
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:48,000
 No, this is a great one.

465
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:54,000
 So, this is claimed by the linguist John McWater to be the most economical language in the world.

466
00:20:54,000 --> 00:21:00,000
 So, there's a phrase 'I am macam', and that just means 'chicken eat'.

467
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:05,000
 But it can also mean, variously, the chicken is eating, chickens are eating,

468
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:09,000
 a chicken is eating, the chicken is eating, the chicken will be eating,

469
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:13,000
 the chicken eats, the chicken has eaten, someone is eating the chicken,

470
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:17,000
 someone is eating with the chicken, chicken that is eating,

471
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:21,000
 and when the chicken is eating, and for others, who's eating with the chicken?

472
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:25,000
 That's the same stuff as the chicken, or are they just eating?

473
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:28,000
 They are factoring at a restaurant as well.

474
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:29,000
 I have the chicken.

475
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:30,000
 Oh, well.

476
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:33,000
 Sorry, you've just been eaten by a chicken?

477
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:36,000
 It's a language of sitcoms, isn't it?

478
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,000
 Yes, yes, yes.

479
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:42,000
 I wanted to eat with the chicken, have you killed it?

480
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:45,000
 So, it's economical, but no one has any idea what anyone else means.

481
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:46,000
 I think so, yeah.

482
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:47,000
 Great.

483
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:48,000
 It's incredible.

484
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:51,000
 The really cool language I like is the 'yup-no' language in Papua,

485
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:54,000
 which is where everything is conceived, everything directionally,

486
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:59,000
 when we'd say go over there, or whatever, is conceived in terms of uphill and downhill.

487
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:03,000
 So, for instance, if you're talking about where the door is,

488
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:08,000
 you'll say, oh, it's just uphill, or if I was saying, oh, whereabouts is James now?

489
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:09,000
 Oh, he's just downhill.

490
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:11,000
 And everything is uphill and downhill.

491
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:17,000
 So, if I'm downhill from you, how do I know whether I'm uphill or downhill?

492
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:20,000
 So, there, they have, because it's quite a small place,

493
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:24,000
 they have a certain geography where everyone kind of knows where the highest point in the island is,

494
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,000
 and the area is.

495
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:26,000
 Everyone knows where the lowest point.

496
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:31,000
 If you're talking about time, then the, oh, the fireplace is always downhill, apparently.

497
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:34,000
 So, if you're in a room, you have to check where the fireplace is.

498
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:37,000
 So, I guess, behind me, at the moment, is the Thames.

499
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:39,000
 So, all of the land kind of goes towards a Thames.

500
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:43,000
 So, you could argue that I'm downhill of you, even if I'm not quite done.

501
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:45,000
 Yeah, unless there's a fireplace on the opposite side of the room.

502
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:47,000
 And then that trumps the Thames.

503
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:51,000
 And then you're uphill, so the fireplace is always the trumping card.

504
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:53,000
 I think the fireplace is the trump card, yes.

505
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:57,000
 Unless you're talking about time, in which case, the past is always downhill,

506
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:58,000
 and the future is uphill.

507
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:00,000
 So, what is that?

508
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,000
 It used to be a fireplace salesman.

509
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,000
 On the Thames.

510
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:09,000
 And an Aboriginal language, which I was reading about, that I didn't write down,

511
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:13,000
 but they judge everything by Northeast South and West.

512
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:14,000
 That's the direction of everything.

513
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:15,000
 Yeah, wow.

514
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:17,000
 I think, yeah, that's a lot of Australian Aboriginal language.

515
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:18,000
 Yeah, exactly.

516
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:19,000
 It's easy to know, though.

517
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:20,000
 Well, you have to know where you are.

518
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,000
 You have to know where you are all the time.

519
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,000
 You can't do any other directions than Northeast South and West.

520
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:30,000
 But there was a study where they did an investigation where they looked at an Aboriginal person

521
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,000
 who had then gone to a different country.

522
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:36,000
 And they realised that instinctively that person still knew always what was Northeast South and West.

523
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:37,000
 Oh, no way.

524
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:39,000
 So they instinctively orienting themselves.

525
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:40,000
 That iPhone.

526
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:41,000
 Not sure.

527
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:44,000
 That's right.

528
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:45,000
 Another language, another cool language.

529
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:46,000
 Yeah.

530
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:53,000
 Okay, so this language is called Kiche, and it was spoken by the Mayans in Guatemala.

531
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:57,000
 And what I love about this is if you're speaking to children,

532
00:23:57,000 --> 00:24:01,000
 normally humans would kind of, in most languages, would kind of talk a little bit higher,

533
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:02,000
 like a bit higher like that.

534
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:07,000
 And if you're speaking to someone, if you're speaking to someone who's a higher status than you,

535
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:08,000
 you speak lower.

536
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:10,000
 But in their language, it's complete with the opposite.

537
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:14,000
 So when you're speaking to someone of a higher status,

538
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:16,000
 you put your voice in a higher pitch.

539
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:17,000
 I think that's amazing.

540
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:18,000
 That's cool.

541
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:19,000
 I want to do that.

542
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:23,000
 When you meet the Queen itself, very nice to meet you.

543
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:25,000
 Are you lost, little girl?

544
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:27,000
 It's very creepy.

545
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:29,000
 Creepy to the point, stupid.

546
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:35,000
 I like this language called Tamayek, or Tamajek, spoken by the tour reg.

547
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:40,000
 And they, so 1984, there was the Prince song Purple Rain.

548
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:42,000
 There was also the movie Purple Rain.

549
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:46,000
 They did a remake of that movie 30 years later.

550
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:49,000
 So the exact movie, it was just a remake in their language.

551
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:52,000
 Unfortunately, in their language, they don't have a word for purple.

552
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:59,000
 So the movie was released as Rain the Color of Blue with a little red in it.

553
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:05,000
 With the Piraha Brazil language, well, someone claimed has no numbers or colors in it.

554
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:09,000
 So by 20-month-old son could go there and rule the place.

555
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:11,000
 Pretty much all he can do.

556
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:13,000
 You can't place snooker, can you?

557
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:17,000
 No, and also, which I don't understand, someone says, but this is controversial.

558
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:24,000
 It's the only language with no recursive, no recursion in it, which is the ability to insert phrases into phrases.

559
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:27,000
 But I didn't quite grasp what that was.

560
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:30,000
 What you can't, you can't put a phrase in a phrase.

561
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:33,000
 You can't say Daniel Fucking Shriver, is that what it is?

562
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:35,000
 It's something along those lines.

563
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:38,000
 I think that's something we should adopt in the English language.

564
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:42,000
 These guys, Piraha has a really cool, so their language is one of the most tonal languages.

565
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:45,000
 So it's different kind of tones as you're speaking.

566
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:54,000
 And so a word which is ha-papa-i, you can pronounce that kapa-papa-i, or ha-ha-i, or kaka-i.

567
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:58,000
 It doesn't matter what the consonants are, it's just the tones.

568
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:03,000
 And so it means that you could kind of talk with your mouth full, or you can whistle words and stuff like that.

569
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:06,000
 Because it's just about the tones, it's not about the consonants.

570
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:11,000
 Because it's like you've got blank scrabble tiles that you can just put into the words.

571
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:15,000
 As you wish, as long as you get the bits in between, right?

572
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:16,000
 Sure.

573
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:18,000
 It's a bit like that.

574
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:25,000
 So when I was saying ha-papa-i, it's the same as saying a-i-i, or whatever.

575
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:29,000
 So no matter what kind of tone you make, that's the thing.

576
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:30,000
 That's very cool.

577
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:33,000
 I like the scrabble analogy though, I think that really worked well.

578
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:34,000
 Oh, thanks.

579
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:36,000
 Sorry, Andy.

580
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:37,000
 I just didn't know.

581
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:39,000
 I simply didn't understand.

582
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:42,000
 James, it simply didn't make sense.

583
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:47,000
 This is about linguistics, right?

584
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:49,000
 And so it's about language.

585
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:51,000
 We don't want language, how it's evolved.

586
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:53,000
 Just get to your very tenuously linked thing.

587
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:57,000
 Well, it's only because I was reading some known Chomsky stuff,

588
00:26:57,000 --> 00:27:00,000
 who is obviously very related to like how language evolves.

589
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:02,000
 And I hate him.

590
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:03,000
 Wow.

591
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:04,000
 I think he's so miserable.

592
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:06,000
 That's too much wine for Anna.

593
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:09,000
 And we can't get in another celebrity feud.

594
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:10,000
 Not with known Chomsky.

595
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:14,000
 It's always after two glass of wine, she's such a slimy, known Chomsky.

596
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:16,000
 It's every time, fucking known.

597
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:18,000
 He feels the same about me, it's fine.

598
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:21,000
 But so no, even Chomsky is obviously like father of linguistics.

599
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:24,000
 It's amazing, like Einstein forget in the linguistics world.

600
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:25,000
 So I was on this linguistics forum.

601
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:27,000
 I was just looking at how language is evolved.

602
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:31,000
 And this forum put a big Chomsky quote at the top.

603
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:33,000
 And it was about the first article he'd ever written.

604
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:35,000
 So he wrote his first article when he was ten years old.

605
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:40,000
 And it was about the, he was like the fascist forces of conquered Barcelona.

606
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:42,000
 Essentially the end of the Spanish Civil War.

607
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:44,000
 And it was all about the spread of Nazi power and stuff.

608
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:45,000
 This guy was ten.

609
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:47,000
 So it's the top of this forum, this academic forum.

610
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:49,000
 This person posts this quote from him.

611
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:50,000
 And it's like thoughts guys.

612
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:52,000
 And the comment immediately below it was.

613
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:54,000
 That sounds incredibly boring.

614
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:57,000
 And then the comment below that was, when I was ten,

615
00:27:57,000 --> 00:28:01,000
 I wrote about an evil jackalant and that terrorized kids on Halloween.

616
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:03,000
 But he had a heart of gold and was just misunderstood.

617
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:06,000
 And then the entire rest of the thread

618
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:08,000
 is them analysing the jackalant.

619
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:12,000
 It does sound a lot better.

620
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:13,000
 Doesn't it?

621
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:14,000
 Sounds amazing.

622
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:15,000
 You'd rather read that.

623
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:16,000
 Definitely.

624
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:17,000
 Yeah.

625
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:18,000
 Good on them.

626
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:26,000
 Okay, it's time for fact number three.

627
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:28,000
 And that is Andy.

628
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:31,000
 My fact is that King George III once went to a safety demonstration

629
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:34,000
 which involved putting the king in a house and setting it on fire.

630
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:35,000
 Wow.

631
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:36,000
 Yeah.

632
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:37,000
 That doesn't sound very safe.

633
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:40,000
 Well, that was, I guess, that's the, that's the trick, isn't it?

634
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:41,000
 That was the safety demonstration.

635
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:42,000
 You'd try and do something.

636
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:43,000
 It looks unsafe.

637
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:44,000
 You say, "I've tricked you."

638
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:45,000
 And he survived, right?

639
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:48,000
 The King survived for another 40 years, nearly.

640
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:50,000
 He's the longest-raining king.

641
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:52,000
 He's the longest-raining king.

642
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:55,000
 Yeah, only Victoria and Elizabeth are both queens.

643
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:56,000
 Oh, he did.

644
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:58,000
 He was 59 years.

645
00:28:58,000 --> 00:28:59,000
 He was 59 years old.

646
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:01,000
 60 days or something.

647
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:02,000
 He was the Kingful.

648
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:03,000
 Wow.

649
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:05,000
 Although, he wasn't very good at it.

650
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:06,000
 Was he?

651
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:08,000
 Well, he lost America.

652
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:10,000
 He's been reassessed, I think.

653
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:11,000
 That's a little bit over the years.

654
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:13,000
 I mean, I think he got a bad rap at the time.

655
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:15,000
 I mean, he was speaking of bad rap.

656
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:16,000
 So, have you seen Hamilton?

657
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:21,000
 I hear he's meant to be the best thing in Hamilton.

658
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:23,000
 Oh, he's so good in it.

659
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:25,000
 But it's not him.

660
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:26,000
 He is dead now.

661
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:29,000
 So, he had extreme safety of the demonstration.

662
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:30,000
 And his long reign.

663
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:33,000
 It couldn't keep him alive past the age of about AC,

664
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:34,000
 which he made it to.

665
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:35,000
 A lot of stuff went on in his...

666
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:36,000
 I was surprised, actually.

667
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:39,000
 I don't know very much about that period of history,

668
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:40,000
 even though I studied history.

669
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:42,000
 And I was surprised how much happened in his reign.

670
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:44,000
 And yeah, he lost a lot of stuff.

671
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:46,000
 As well as the plot in the main thing,

672
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:48,000
 which was actually very sad, wasn't it?

673
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:50,000
 So, he did go very mad.

674
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:53,000
 His illness was diagnosed as flying out.

675
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:54,000
 Wow.

676
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:57,000
 Can I just say I think Andy is desperate to tell us a story

677
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:58,000
 of this house on fire.

678
00:29:58,000 --> 00:29:59,000
 No, no, we don't.

679
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:02,000
 We can go into the broader sociological implications of his reign.

680
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:06,000
 Does this such an exciting story about the claiming house?

681
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:08,000
 Andy, please, back to the burning building.

682
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:09,000
 Yeah, yeah.

683
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:10,000
 How does that happen?

684
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:12,000
 So, I should tell you where this comes from.

685
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:14,000
 This is a book called 1776, A London Chronicle,

686
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:17,000
 which is all about only stuff happening in 1776.

687
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:18,000
 Very busy year.

688
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:19,000
 Lots of innovations.

689
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:20,000
 Lots of stuff going on.

690
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:22,000
 The American colonies on the brink of being lost.

691
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:23,000
 All of this stuff.

692
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:25,000
 And there was a scientist called David Hartley,

693
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:28,000
 who had this amazing new way of making a house fireproof.

694
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:31,000
 And it basically just involved putting iron plates in it

695
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:34,000
 all the way through, like a magician and a box.

696
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:35,000
 Yeah.

697
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:38,000
 So, the king stood upstairs and flaming pitch

698
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:40,000
 destroyed the lower half of the house,

699
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:41,000
 and he was absolutely fine.

700
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:43,000
 And this happened on the very day

701
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:47,000
 that the news reached London of the American Declaration of Independence.

702
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:50,000
 So, it was like it was a big day for daughter third.

703
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:51,000
 Wow, wow.

704
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:53,000
 It's like you sport the day.

705
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:54,000
 That didn't even happen.

706
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:55,000
 It's a great day.

707
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:57,000
 Up to the upstairs and a burning house and a fire.

708
00:30:57,000 --> 00:31:00,000
 What's been happening while I've gone?

709
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:03,000
 The guy you just talked about, David Hartley.

710
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:07,000
 He has a sort of long lasting legacy around the world.

711
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:09,000
 And, you know, we're here in the West End.

712
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:12,000
 He is the person who invented the fire curtain

713
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:14,000
 that goes down in front of Stages.

714
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:15,000
 Yeah.

715
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:17,000
 He hated fire, didn't he?

716
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:20,000
 Yes.

717
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:21,000
 What's his problem with fire?

718
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:22,000
 Let it fire.

719
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:23,000
 Have a few fires.

720
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:26,000
 He was thought of as an eccentric

721
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:29,000
 because he didn't powder his hair when everyone else did.

722
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:30,000
 Oh, man.

723
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:31,000
 Who George the Third or David Hartley?

724
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:32,000
 David Hartley.

725
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:35,000
 George the Third was thought as quite eccentric as well.

726
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:36,000
 Yes, but other reasons.

727
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:38,000
 He also wore stockings with a feet cut out

728
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:40,000
 because he thought it was healthier.

729
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:43,000
 And that made you an eccentric in those days.

730
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:44,000
 Wow.

731
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:45,000
 That isn't interesting.

732
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:46,000
 You didn't need to do much, did you?

733
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:48,000
 To be called an eccentric now,

734
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:50,000
 you need to work pretty damn hard.

735
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:51,000
 I've been trying for years.

736
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:52,000
 Yeah.

737
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:54,000
 And the house became popular.

738
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:56,000
 And was used throughout England.

739
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:58,000
 You know, the plates methods spread across the country.

740
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:02,000
 But then other methods took over which were more efficient

741
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:04,000
 and didn't involve putting huge iron plates all the way

742
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:05,000
 to the house.

743
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:07,000
 And then the original house, the test house,

744
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:09,000
 a very sadly caught fire.

745
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:10,000
 No.

746
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:11,000
 Yeah.

747
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:13,000
 It had been extended beyond the safe bit.

748
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:14,000
 You know, so it was an extension.

749
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:15,000
 Yeah.

750
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:17,000
 So that extension caught fire and then collapsed

751
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:18,000
 onto the fire proof section.

752
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:19,000
 Oh.

753
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:20,000
 And then that caught fire.

754
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:22,000
 You needed some iron plates on the top to stop that.

755
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:23,000
 Yeah.

756
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:26,000
 How do you talk a king into standing in a flaming house?

757
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:27,000
 I don't know.

758
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:28,000
 If he's mad, it's easy.

759
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:29,000
 That's correct.

760
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:31,000
 They got the right king.

761
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:32,000
 You're right.

762
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:33,000
 Yeah.

763
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:35,000
 And I think he was going a bit mad around that time.

764
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:38,000
 He had a few bouts of madness through his life.

765
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:40,000
 One of them was just before the French Revolution.

766
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:42,000
 So that must have been sort of around the bad words.

767
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:45,000
 There's a bit later than that.

768
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:46,000
 Yeah.

769
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:49,000
 When he did start to lose his mind, at one stage in 1819,

770
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:53,000
 he spoke nonsense nonstop for 58 hours.

771
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:55,000
 It was at Christmas time as well, that one.

772
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:56,000
 Yeah.

773
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:59,000
 Which, you know, that happens at my house with my dad.

774
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:03,000
 It also says it was a bit racist.

775
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:04,000
 Going on about Brexit.

776
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:07,000
 That's not what I'm talking about.

777
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:08,000
 Yeah.

778
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:10,000
 It sounds like he really, really suffered.

779
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:13,000
 And obviously it wasn't understood nearly as much at the time.

780
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:15,000
 So, you know, he has this reputation.

781
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:17,000
 But he did, obviously, huge amount of stuff.

782
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:18,000
 He was a very interesting guy.

783
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:19,000
 He was a hobbyist.

784
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:23,000
 He wrote architectural journal articles under a pen name secretly.

785
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:24,000
 Did he?

786
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:26,000
 He was interested in all sorts of stuff.

787
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:31,000
 Yeah, he had a huge capacity for wanting to know what was going on in his kingdom, I think.

788
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:32,000
 Yeah.

789
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:36,000
 He had a weird marriage to a woman called Charlotte.

790
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:41,000
 Charlotte of a Mecklenburg Strelitz, who was from this random German Dutchy.

791
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:46,000
 And she was very parsimonious, no, it's been parsimonious.

792
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:50,000
 The only remnant we have of her is a dish called Apple Charlotte, apparently.

793
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:54,000
 And that Apple Charlotte is a pudding that uses up stale bread,

794
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:57,000
 because she didn't want to waste anything.

795
00:33:57,000 --> 00:34:03,000
 And she used to stamp butter with the royal signet so that the servants couldn't eat it to say this is our butter.

796
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:04,000
 Wow.

797
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:05,000
 Don't touch.

798
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:08,000
 She was famously ugly and there was a quote about her.

799
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:11,000
 This is suddenly tipped over into personal opinions.

800
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:16,000
 Sometimes I feel like women haven't taken enough flak in history.

801
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:19,000
 And we've got a sense of abuse there way.

802
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:21,000
 So she was famously hideous.

803
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:24,000
 And one of the nability said that as she got older, this is a famous quote,

804
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:29,000
 is that as she got older, the bloom has at any rate gone off the queen's ugliness.

805
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:33,000
 Since she fell off this carriage and broke her nose, she's actually quite handsome.

806
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:34,000
 Wow.

807
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:35,000
 Yeah.

808
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:37,000
 But you married her the day you met her, didn't you?

809
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:38,000
 Yes, I remember.

810
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:42,000
 And he was baptised on the day he was born, because he was two months premature,

811
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:46,000
 which at the time was like, you know, definitely you're going to die.

812
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:47,000
 But he survived.

813
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:49,000
 But they had a very happy marriage.

814
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:52,000
 He was faithful to her, which you know, if you've got what's the point of being king.

815
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:55,000
 If you're going to be faithful to your wife, that's the point.

816
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:56,000
 Yeah.

817
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:57,000
 And they had like 15 children.

818
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:58,000
 Okay.

819
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:01,000
 So I'm just, I'm just almost making this up, I think.

820
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:06,000
 But I thought that in his madness, he actually did have a fair as off the back of

821
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:08,000
 he was just in a hypostate.

822
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:09,000
 Right.

823
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:10,000
 He wasn't really aware.

824
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:11,000
 Oh, though.

825
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:14,000
 And I think he was, when he properly was mad, he was like in his 70s and 80s.

826
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:16,000
 So I don't think he would have been much of a threat.

827
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:17,000
 And he was blind.

828
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:19,000
 So I don't, I think he might have.

829
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:22,000
 I got a lot of affairs with balls.

830
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:23,000
 And he shook hands with the tree.

831
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:24,000
 And he fell asleep.

832
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:25,000
 Oh, that's true.

833
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:26,000
 He did.

834
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:29,000
 So, you know, we might have been having affairs with Flora and Horn.

835
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:30,000
 Yeah.

836
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:31,000
 Yeah.

837
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:32,000
 Yeah, I don't know.

838
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:34,000
 He definitely did get off with her a lot.

839
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:35,000
 Yeah.

840
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:36,000
 15 children.

841
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:37,000
 Well, nine boys.

842
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:39,000
 It's like, he stayed faithful to one woman, had 15 children.

843
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:41,000
 It's a real fuck you to King Henry VIII, doesn't it?

844
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:42,000
 Yeah.

845
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:43,000
 Just stick with one.

846
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:44,000
 Let's keep plowing away.

847
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:48,000
 And only one, I think 13 of his children survived into adulthood.

848
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:49,000
 Yeah.

849
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:50,000
 I think so.

850
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:51,000
 Yeah.

851
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:53,000
 But he later refused his daughter's the ability to marry.

852
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:56,000
 He was, he was, he was really happy with his wife.

853
00:35:56,000 --> 00:36:01,000
 But I think he was so worried about them making unsuitable marriages that only three of his daughter's

854
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:04,000
 managed to marry in the end, just because he was such a tyrant about it.

855
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:09,000
 And he passed a law saying that if you were a royal eight under 25, you could not marry without the

856
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:11,000
 express permission of the ruling sovereign.

857
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:14,000
 And that law stayed in place until 2013.

858
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:15,000
 Really?

859
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:16,000
 Yeah.

860
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:17,000
 Yeah.

861
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:22,000
 Yeah, I think he was skeptical about marriage because his sister's marriage had gone very badly.

862
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:27,000
 So his sister was Caroline Matilde and she'd married a guy called King Christian, the seventh

863
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:29,000
 of Denmark, when she was 15.

864
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:32,000
 And he was also quite mad.

865
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:34,000
 And he hung her, he didn't like her at all.

866
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:36,000
 The fifth, his 15-year-old sister.

867
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:40,000
 So he hung her portrait in his lavatory as a show of how he didn't like his wife.

868
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:41,000
 So his wife?

869
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:42,000
 Yeah.

870
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:44,000
 He hung his wife's portrait in the toilet.

871
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:46,000
 And he was an obsessive masturbator.

872
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:47,000
 He was very famous.

873
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:48,000
 Did he do it in the toilet?

874
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:50,000
 Is that why the portrait was there?

875
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:52,000
 I think the toilet was the only one we didn't do it.

876
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:53,000
 Really?

877
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:57,000
 Yeah, he went to see doctors about this and doctors were always trying to stop him doing it.

878
00:36:57,000 --> 00:37:01,000
 But he once entered a feast with his trousers, round his ankles.

879
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:06,000
 And he had servants, manical him and then beat him with rolls of paper.

880
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:11,000
 And he visited England once and he visited all the brothels in London and then completely

881
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:14,000
 trashed St. James's palace.

882
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:16,000
 And so that was the man that his sister married.

883
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:17,000
 Oh, okay.

884
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:21,000
 St. George III thought, well, marriage doesn't go well for her.

885
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:24,000
 Let's protect women for the excessive masturbation.

886
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:29,000
 So he saw a doctor, I'd love to hear the doctor transcript read that.

887
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:32,000
 So the way to stop doing this is, okay, you're masturbating.

888
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:33,000
 You're masturbating.

889
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:35,000
 Yeah, just put it back away.

890
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:37,000
 Okay, so yeah, so we have lots of medicines.

891
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:39,000
 Okay, you're masturbating again.

892
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:41,000
 We're just going to have to put that away again.

893
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:43,000
 Okay, you're doing very good.

894
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:46,000
 It's very difficult to stop.

895
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:48,000
 You know, you've got to be some person to stop.

896
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:51,000
 Hey, you don't need to tell me.

897
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:53,000
 So, Queen Charlotte, we were talking about.

898
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:54,000
 Yeah.

899
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:59,000
 She had a pet zebra who was presented to her by the governor of the Cape in South Africa.

900
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:03,000
 And it was known colloquially as the Queen's Ass.

901
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:07,000
 And there was a massive scandal when the Queen's Guard were caught charging people

902
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:10,000
 to expose the Queen's ass to public view.

903
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:15,000
 In 1764, and you guys are really holding this thing very nicely.

904
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:19,000
 The newspaper's printed a story that the guards were charging people to see this.

905
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:24,000
 And then Queen Charlotte later bred this zebra by getting a male donkey

906
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:27,000
 and painting the back of it white and black stripes

907
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:29,000
 so that it thought that it was a zebra's...

908
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:31,000
 Wow, that cast.

909
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:32,000
 ...ass, yeah, exactly.

910
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:33,000
 And it worked.

911
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:35,000
 Wow, I'm going to try that with my own bottom.

912
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:38,000
 I'm going to take my own bottom black and white and see if I can get a zebra to fuck me.

913
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:40,000
 It's what I'm going to do.

914
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:42,000
 I've always been quite obsessed with having sex with a nacapie,

915
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:46,000
 which is like a sort of larmory zebra or a kind of thing.

916
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:48,000
 But from behind, it's got a very nice...

917
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:49,000
 It looks like a sort of...

918
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:50,000
 You've always been...

919
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:51,000
 No, I've just...

920
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:52,000
 And they've got...

921
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:54,000
 I've been obsessed with a nacapie before.

922
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:56,000
 I've been to see a nacapie quite a few times in La Junseau.

923
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:58,000
 From behind, it's like...

924
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:00,000
 It's got a very leopard-skin trouser...

925
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:01,000
 Right.

926
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:03,000
 You know, so it looks like a lady's hind core.

927
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:04,000
 So that's nice.

928
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:06,000
 Well, the cup's got a very long tongue.

929
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:08,000
 So you could be there and then they can't...

930
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:10,000
 If a hat dives up to an animal.

931
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:11,000
 That's it.

932
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:14,000
 I don't think this sounds like if I had to situation.

933
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:16,000
 I think there's too much thought that's gone into this.

934
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:19,000
 If I hadn't had sex with me, I would paint my bottom black and white.

935
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:21,000
 It's just the one I wouldn't mind.

936
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:23,000
 Yes, it's fair, Andy.

937
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:26,000
 We've all got one.

938
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:28,000
 Does he let you in London zoo?

939
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:29,000
 They do.

940
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:32,000
 I'm a member of London zoo.

941
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:34,000
 I can go anytime I want.

942
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:36,000
 It's a new meaning to the word "member of London zoo".

943
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:38,000
 Wow.

944
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:40,000
 What is going on?

945
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:41,000
 Oh, you don't know enough.

946
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:43,000
 They let you masturbate quickly.

947
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:46,000
 What are you donating?

948
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:50,000
 They're hoping that I'm creating a new hybrid creature that they can put in.

949
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:52,000
 Imagine if it was successful.

950
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:53,000
 Oh, God.

951
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:55,000
 The herring zebra.

952
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:57,000
 The herring ocapie.

953
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:02,000
 I have taken the tone down.

954
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:03,000
 No, no, no.

955
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:12,000
 Let's bring the tone back up.

956
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:15,000
 It is time for our final fact of the show, and that is James.

957
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:22,000
 My fact this week is that female hyenas say hello by licking each other's clitoruses.

958
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:24,000
 Crunky.

959
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:27,000
 An uncompromisingly direct greeting, I would say.

960
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:32,000
 I just now feel like we're giving Richard ideas for his next trip to the zoo.

961
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:34,000
 I'm just saying quite a bit.

962
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:36,000
 Very nicely.

963
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:41,000
 Is that why the male hyenas are always laughing just out of sort of awkwardness and excitement?

964
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:50,000
 Okay, so this fact was sent to me by text.

965
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:52,000
 But not honestly.

966
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:57,000
 By the saw herring.

967
00:40:57,000 --> 00:41:03,000
 When we're on top, there was no name attached, but phone number ends with 067, so you know who you are.

968
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:06,000
 Yeah, that's nearly my number.

969
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:13,000
 I confirmed it in a book called Wild Sex, The Science Behind Mating in the Animal Kingdom by Karen Bonda.

970
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:15,000
 And yet, it seems that it does happen.

971
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:21,000
 So when females arrive and see each other, they stand in a parallel position facing opposite directions,

972
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:27,000
 lift the hind legs, display the fully erect clitoruses to each other, and then they smell and lick them.

973
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:31,000
 And this is because female hyenas have extremely large clitoruses.

974
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:34,000
 Do they ever smell them and not lick them?

975
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:36,000
 They smell them.

976
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:37,000
 No.

977
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:39,000
 Sorry.

978
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:42,000
 That's not as very awkward in the hyena world.

979
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:48,000
 It's like, you know, when you give someone a high five and they don't give you a high five back, it's exactly like that.

980
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:50,000
 Wow.

981
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:51,000
 Yeah.

982
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:59,000
 So, and this happens between females of different ranks, and depending on who licks first, depends on who is the most highest ranking.

983
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:01,000
 And they have, they're like seven inches long, aren't they?

984
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:03,000
 About seven inches long with clitoruses.

985
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:04,000
 Yeah.

986
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:08,000
 They're essentially a penis in appearance, and they get erections.

987
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:11,000
 So when they're copulating, they get erections.

988
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:14,000
 And they also have a labia that's fused to like testes.

989
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:18,000
 It actually does seem a bit like, because they've all just got the genders the wrong way around.

990
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:20,000
 Except that they give birth through them.

991
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:23,000
 And then they give birth through them, and so that clarifies things.

992
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:24,000
 Yes.

993
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:25,000
 And it's a horrific birth.

994
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:26,000
 Yeah.

995
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:27,000
 Yeah.

996
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:36,000
 I think it's the only animal birth that's worse than humans, because humans are not very well adapted to give birth, because we've got our hits of two narrow and our heads are too big, essentially.

997
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:43,000
 And so our birth is much, much more traumatic than almost any other animal, but hyenas, it is worse, because you aren't giving birth through a penis.

998
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:44,000
 Yes.

999
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:47,000
 There's two types of erections, which are very useful to know.

1000
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:50,000
 There's a social erection and a sexual erection.

1001
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:51,000
 No.

1002
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:54,000
 What I've got here, this is a social erection.

1003
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:58,000
 And now I've got, now I know about that, that's a good thing to know.

1004
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:02,000
 Unless anyone fans is having sex in which case, it can just turn very quickly into a sexual erection.

1005
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:05,000
 Well, but where does it turn if you're interested?

1006
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:07,000
 Ah, if you're interested, it's suddenly as a sexual erection.

1007
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:09,000
 In my case, I don't know if that's the case.

1008
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:13,000
 It turns just as you walk past the large ungulate section of the zoo.

1009
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:20,000
 It's very difficult for the males, the true males, to mate as well.

1010
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:26,000
 So they have to practice a lot, because being able to get your genuine penis into this long clitoris is a tough gig.

1011
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:28,000
 It's like dots.

1012
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:34,000
 And so it takes about two months practice from male hyenas before you are able to penetrate properly.

1013
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:39,000
 Yeah, and they're probably crouching behind them and trying to point the penis the right way.

1014
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:40,000
 Two months of...

1015
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:46,000
 Yeah, you say that, but George III's brother-in-law was practicing for a lot longer than that.

1016
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:50,000
 But 60% of hyena cubs suffocate on the way out.

1017
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:52,000
 No, yeah, it's so sad.

1018
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:54,000
 Yeah, more than half, because you're in this long chute.

1019
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:56,000
 Holy moly, it's crazy.

1020
00:43:56,000 --> 00:44:01,000
 There's all sorts of hyena mythologian, because of the fact they're so weird.

1021
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:07,000
 And just beliefs about them, so plenty of the elder, friend of the show.

1022
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:09,000
 He said that...

1023
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:11,000
 Keep writing it.

1024
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:16,000
 He said that hyenas are capable of calling people by name, because they're quite weird.

1025
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:20,000
 They sound slightly humed in the way they're off, calling people by name, and then killing you when you go outside.

1026
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:21,000
 So they lure you out.

1027
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:23,000
 You think someone's calling you.

1028
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:29,000
 Pliny, pliny, pliny, pliny, the elder, pliny, the elder.

1029
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:32,000
 Get that hyena out of here.

1030
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:38,000
 There's also in mythology. Have you heard of werewolves? There's werehyenas.

1031
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:40,000
 Which is very exciting, but they have a different thing.

1032
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:44,000
 So your classic werewolf will obviously be your wolf.

1033
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:46,000
 I'm sorry, a human that turns into a wolf.

1034
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:50,000
 With the werehyena, it's often a hyena that turns into a human.

1035
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:54,000
 So at night time, on a full moon, you might be talking to a human.

1036
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:58,000
 And they will not be socialised at all.

1037
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:02,000
 Because they spend five, six third time as hyenas.

1038
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:04,000
 Yeah. And their penis might be a clitoris.

1039
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:06,000
 That is true.

1040
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:10,000
 They're greetings. You can tell you've met one immediately.

1041
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:12,000
 As soon as they walk into a party, you know it's them.

1042
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:18,000
 They must be disappointed in how hard it's to find the human clitoris though.

1043
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:20,000
 What's going on?

1044
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:22,000
 It's not even here.

1045
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:28,000
 Oh, I guess a lot of sympathy from fellow men at the party at that point.

1046
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:32,000
 I know, right?

1047
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:38,000
 Walter Rally thought that hyenas were so disgusting that Noah refused to let them on the arc.

1048
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:44,000
 And the species was only resurrected after a natural copulation between a dog and a cat.

1049
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:46,000
 Okay.

1050
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:52,000
 It's not as terrifying as the Richard Herring, London Zoo or Captain Treacher.

1051
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:54,000
 I've got some clitoris fat.

1052
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:56,000
 Yes please.

1053
00:45:56,000 --> 00:46:00,000
 The clitoris is the only part of the human body that never ages.

1054
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:04,000
 20 year old clitoris and eight year old clitoris are identical.

1055
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:06,000
 So you can't count the rings.

1056
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:10,000
 They get slightly bigger sometimes throughout life, but then they don't look.

1057
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:12,000
 They don't wrinkle, I guess.

1058
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:14,000
 That is a really good idea.

1059
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:16,000
 That's extraordinary.

1060
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:20,000
 And also, I was surprised, the word clitoris only dates for that.

1061
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:26,000
 And then the word clit was only came up in America in the 1950s.

1062
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:30,000
 So it took 200 years, 300 years, some of the short and clitoris.

1063
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:32,000
 There were saying clitoris for a long time for some of those.

1064
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:34,000
 This is a mouthful.

1065
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:36,000
 Do we know if it had a meaning before?

1066
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:40,000
 I think it is a Latin word.

1067
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:44,000
 I think it means hood.

1068
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:48,000
 I would have had a different meaning.

1069
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:50,000
 I would go around with a...

1070
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:52,000
 With a clitoris, I would say.

1071
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:54,000
 I don't know what the Romans called a clitoris.

1072
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:56,000
 If they didn't call it a clitoris.

1073
00:46:56,000 --> 00:47:00,000
 One would have always related to the fact that women weren't thought to be...

1074
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:02,000
 They weren't thought to have any organs that would experience that.

1075
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:04,000
 They weren't thought to have organs.

1076
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:06,000
 They weren't thought to have organs.

1077
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:08,000
 They could experience sexual pleasure or anything.

1078
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:10,000
 But actually, that's often a myth.

1079
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:12,000
 I think they often did.

1080
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:16,000
 I think in ancient Greek, in ancient Greece, women often talked about the pleasure you get from sex.

1081
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:18,000
 There must have been a concept of a clitoris.

1082
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:20,000
 What was it called, Greek?

1083
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:22,000
 Any Greeks listening?

1084
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:24,000
 Plenty of you could ask for a name.

1085
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:26,000
 Was it called a wipple tickle or something?

1086
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:28,000
 We always get that fact set.

1087
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:30,000
 That was supposedly what the G-spot was going to be called.

1088
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:32,000
 It was doctor something.

1089
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:34,000
 Was it Beverly Wipple?

1090
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:36,000
 No, it was a doctor.

1091
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:38,000
 His name started with G.

1092
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:40,000
 The reason the G-spot is called the G-spot is because it's named after a doctor...

1093
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:42,000
 It's something like Geistner.

1094
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:44,000
 Geistner starts with G.

1095
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:46,000
 Should we call it the Gavin?

1096
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:48,000
 No, no, no, no.

1097
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:50,000
 If I discovered that I wanted to have my whole name, wouldn't it be called the R-spot?

1098
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:52,000
 I wanted to be the Richie Spot as well as one of mine.

1099
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:54,000
 No, the R-spot.

1100
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:58,000
 The Gavin.

1101
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:02,000
 It would stop serving its purpose immediately if you call it the Gavin.

1102
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:08,000
 Okay, that is it.

1103
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:10,000
 That is all our facts.

1117
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:35,000

 He's going to be in Edinburgh.

1121
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:45,000
 So all through August, he's going to be there.

1122
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:46,000
 He's got all of his tour dates.

1123

 We had an amazing time chatting to him about us generally.

1128
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:00,000
 He made us say weird things.

1129
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:01,000
 Check it out.

1130
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:02,000
 Okay, that is it.

1131
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:03,000
 That is all of our facts.

1132
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:05,000
 We'll see you again next week.

1133
