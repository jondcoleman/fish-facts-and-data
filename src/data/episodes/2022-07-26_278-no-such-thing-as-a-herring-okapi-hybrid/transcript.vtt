00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:24.000
 Hello and welcome to another episode of no such thing as a fish, a weekly podcast coming to you from the QI offices in Covent Garden.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:31.000
 I'm Dan Schreiber, I'm sitting here with Anish Zenski, Andrew Hunter Murray, James Harkin and exciting special guest.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:36.000
 It is the pod father himself, Richard Herring, who is joining us.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:41.000
 We're very excited to have him here, doubly excited because we got the chance to go on his show.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:47.000
 Richard Herring's Lester Square Theatre podcast, which will be going out next week, the 24th of July.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:51.000
 If you're listening to it, as this show goes out this Friday, it's a week from now.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:56.000
 If not, find the 24th of July for Richard Herring and so much more.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.000
 I mean, you're going to be doing the podcast in Edinburgh.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:02.000
 Yeah, I'm at the Edinburgh Fringe at the Newtown Theatre, 130, pretty much every day throughout the Fringe.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:07.000
 And I'm off on tour around the country in the autumn and probably onwards, beyond into 2020, I think.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:10.000
 So yeah, go to richhane.com/gigs and you can find out where I'm coming.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:14.000
 Amazing, and most importantly of all, you've got a fact.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.000
 So we're going to start off with fact number one, and that is Richard Herring.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:27.000
 Here's my fact. Adolf Hitler had size 13 feet, which I discovered this week on my own podcast,

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:31.000
 because I'm obsessed with the film The Cobbler, what's that?

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.000
 Adam Sandler, yeah.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.000
 In which Adam Sandler inherits a magical cobbling machine.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.000
 If you're interested in this, just listen to any of Richard's podcasts.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:41.000
 In which?

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:45.000
 In which, if he puts on the feet of the shoes of someone whose shoes have been cobbled on that machine,

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.000
 he turns into that person, which is fine.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.000
 So I asked people who they would turn into, but you've got to have the same size feet.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.000
 So it's quite a hard question to answer unless you know.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:55.000
 Especially for Adolf Hitler.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:00.000
 Yeah, well, my guest said, you know, who knows how big was Adolf Hitler's feet, for example.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:04.000
 And we didn't know, but then someone Googled it, and it was size 13, which just seems...

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:05.000
 It seems big.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:10.000
 Massive for what I thought was a very short man, but he's five foot, eight, five foot nine.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:15.000
 I'm like 165 centimeters, but size 13 is like gigantic.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:16.000
 Yeah.

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:17.000
 Stephen Fry has size 13 feet.

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:18.000
 Doesn't he?

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:19.000
 And he's what, six foot six?

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:20.000
 And something like that.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.000
 Usain Bolt, he has size 13 feet.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:23.000
 Is he tall?

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:24.000
 Usain Bolt.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:25.000
 Yeah.

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:26.000
 Famously, yeah.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:27.000
 Is he?

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:28.000
 Yeah.

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:29.000
 It's hard to tell because they're just so fast.

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:30.000
 You can't see that.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:34.000
 Well, Meg Ryan, who is, I believe, the same height as Hitler, five foot eight.

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:37.000
 I don't think that's the brush we can tar her with.

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:40.000
 It's on her CV, it's the top line.

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:42.000
 I believe I'm right, saying she's five foot eight.

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:43.000
 And she has big feet.

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:45.000
 She's got 11, she's where it's size 11.

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:46.000
 Oh, wow.

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:47.000
 Yeah.

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:48.000
 That's huge.

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:49.000
 Is that a US 11?

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:50.000
 Yeah, we'll be.

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:51.000
 Hang on, that's completely different.

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:52.000
 I take back a lot of my friends.

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:53.000
 Is the US 11?

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:57.000
 Well, I don't know if the adult Hitler 13 is US or English.

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:58.000
 Isn't there somewhere?

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:01.000
 Isn't the USA or Europe, whether in the 40s?

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:02.000
 That's Europe.

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:03.000
 That's Europe, isn't it?

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:06.000
 I think the American size is about one different.

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:07.000
 So they're 0.5 or one different.

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:09.000
 OK, but what a Hitler size feet is in the European measurement.

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:11.000
 And actually, they were like pins.

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:13.000
 That's a really good point.

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:14.000
 Yeah.

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:16.000
 Yeah, actually, Rich, what is your sauce for this fact?

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:17.000
 Well, Google.

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:18.000
 OK.

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:21.000
 But then Google just says you were one size round of it.

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:22.000
 It says 13.

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:24.000
 One says 13 and a half.

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:25.000
 OK.

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:30.000
 And then I found a 56-page medical report from the CIA

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:35.000
 that was based on the doctor who had seen Hitler over from 1936

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:36.000
 to his death.

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:38.000
 And it had a lot of facts on it.

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:39.000
 And I read most.

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:40.000
 Did you say how many balls he had?

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:43.000
 Well, that was interested to look into that.

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:46.000
 And it says there's nothing wrong with his genitalia, which is...

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:49.000
 He had a farting problem from that medical report, as I could tell.

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:51.000
 Yeah, he was very flatulent.

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:52.000
 Was he?

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:53.000
 A gastro-problems in his tummy.

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:55.000
 It's a thorough inflammation he had as well.

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:57.000
 So he had a very blocked nose.

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:59.000
 Oh, what should he do?

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:00.000
 No.

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:02.000
 No, I don't think we're making that noise.

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:03.000
 No, yeah.

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:04.000
 He's not that Hitler.

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:05.000
 Poor old Hitler.

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:06.000
 He was...

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:08.000
 I did his BMI in 1936.

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:11.000
 He came out at 22.5, which is a pretty good BMI.

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:12.000
 Oh, I think that's...

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:13.000
 I think that's my BMI.

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:14.000
 Yeah, you got the same as Hitler.

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:16.000
 It's not the top line of your CB, though.

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:17.000
 I'm afraid it is.

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:19.000
 But it's kind of weird, because you start...

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:21.000
 I started looking up the historical figures.

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:23.000
 And you can't find anyone's foot size.

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:25.000
 It's something that's not really recorded very...

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:26.000
 Yeah, you're right.

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:29.000
 You can find celebrities sometimes if they've got big or small feet.

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:30.000
 Yeah, that's...

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:33.000
 You try to look up a lot of celebrity foot sizes,

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:35.000
 and you just found a load of fetish sites.

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:38.000
 Well, there are lots of people who have these websites

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:40.000
 where they're interested in celebrities' feet.

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:41.000
 And I wish you...

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:43.000
 Well, how your voice slightly dropped when you said that.

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:46.000
 Well, I'm not embarrassed.

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:51.000
 I was reading about celebrity shoes,

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:52.000
 and there's a little theory.

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:56.000
 So I don't know if we can class Hitler in the celebrity bracket.

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:58.000
 Yeah, we can put him in there, right?

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:00.000
 So, celebrities when they go...

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:02.000
 He's not going on celebrity, you know...

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:03.000
 Get me out of here.

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:04.000
 Hey, buddy, wood, now, that's the point.

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:07.000
 All those that kind of level of politician,

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:09.000
 that's the way they become successfully would be all over them.

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:11.000
 Do you think it's like the "Hurry Red" now?

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:14.000
 I think he's like an "Widdicum" of his day.

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:18.000
 Yeah, so I think that I read that certain celebrities do

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:19.000
 when they're going on the red carpet,

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:22.000
 is they often wear much larger shoes than their foot size.

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:25.000
 That's a common thing in Hollywood, because...

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:27.000
 Well, often when you're going out, you're wearing new shoes, aren't you?

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:28.000
 And you haven't broken them in.

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:30.000
 So if you're wearing a shoe that fits your foot perfectly,

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:33.000
 you're going to get blisters, you're going to mess up your feet.

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:35.000
 So when you're on the red carpet, there's often photos,

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:38.000
 there's celebrities who've got huge gaps at the back of their heels,

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:40.000
 if it's a woman wearing heels.

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:41.000
 What? No.

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:43.000
 People just fall off constantly on the red carpet.

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:45.000
 It's all an episode of Cinderella.

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:47.000
 Every time someone walks down it.

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:50.000
 It's just... It's J-Lo, does it? Yeah, it's a thing.

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:52.000
 No. It's a thing.

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:54.000
 Wow. Okay, apparently you know I...

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:56.000
 The more you say it, the more likely it will be to be true.

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:59.000
 If there are any celebrities out there, please write in a lettuce note.

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:01.000
 If there are no celebrities listening to this show.

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:04.000
 No, that's absolutely right and quite right from them.

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:07.000
 There are feet are getting bigger, apparently,

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:11.000
 which I find really weird, but there was a survey done in 1951, I think,

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:15.000
 and it looked into people's shoe sizes, as well as other stuff.

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:19.000
 And apparently the average shoe size for a woman then was size three,

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:23.000
 which is insane, because I don't know any women with size three feet.

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:25.000
 Kylie Minogue. Kylie Minogue.

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:27.000
 I don't know her, though.

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:28.000
 She's probably listening, though.

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:30.000
 So is it true that we're evolving that way,

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:34.000
 because maybe only big-fotted women are having sex and having children?

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:37.000
 Yeah, big-fotted women became incredibly sexy in the late 50s.

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:38.000
 Yeah.

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:40.000
 And yeah, we bred out the small-footed ones.

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:42.000
 It was a great triumph.

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:47.000
 The theory is the explanation I read is that we're getting fatter.

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:51.000
 And so we're pushing ourselves down on our feet and we're flattening our arms.

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:52.000
 No, it is true.

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:55.000
 It is to do with body size, increasing, they think.

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:57.000
 I actually think those studies must have also been flawed,

00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:00.000
 because I don't believe shoe sizes have gone up three sizes.

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:02.000
 So now the average for a girl is size six.

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:06.000
 But it's not like we've all got tiny skeleton feet, a massive, flabby fat on them.

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:08.000
 It's not about the fatness.

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:10.000
 It's about the arch being pressed down.

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:12.000
 It's sort of squeezed out a bit.

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:14.000
 So you do get, you get wider feet, as well, for example.

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:17.000
 And also, the other reason is better nutrition.

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:20.000
 If you're a child and you have better nutrition, you will just be bigger.

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:23.000
 And that means your feet will be bigger, as well.

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:24.000
 You will like this.

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:27.000
 One retailer called it Bigfoot Britain.

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:28.000
 Nice.

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:29.000
 That is very cool.

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:34.000
 I did do some, I got sidetracked doing Bigfoot research while I was actually doing that.

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:35.000
 The links came up.

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:36.000
 I had to read it, you know.

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:38.000
 The investigation continues.

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:41.000
 Wait, does Bigfoot actually have big feet?

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:42.000
 Yeah, hence his name.

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:44.000
 Well, I've never actually pictured his feet.

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:46.000
 Does he have a big feet for a Bigfoot?

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:47.000
 That's the question.

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:50.000
 In the 50s, Bigfoot was just called foot.

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:51.000
 Foot.

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:53.000
 Yeah.

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:55.000
 Do you know who had the biggest feet of all time?

00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:56.000
 No.

00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:59.000
 It's the tallest man of all time who was called Robert Wadlow.

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:05.000
 He had size 37 or 36 UK size feet.

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:10.000
 He had real problems finding shoes, obviously, because he was the only person in the world with this size shoes.

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:12.000
 And he...

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:16.000
 He's imagining him walking past a clock's sale, thinking, maybe this time.

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:21.000
 Well, when he was at high school, he wanted to play sport.

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:26.000
 He wanted to play basketball, because he thought he could stand next to the hoop and just put his hand over the hoop.

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:28.000
 He'd start anyone from scarring.

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:32.000
 But he couldn't get training shoes made quickly enough so he could never play.

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:33.000
 I was just speaking of growing.

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:37.000
 When he's only standing by the thing, he doesn't just put it up just very often.

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:39.000
 But some socks.

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:43.000
 Is there a rule that says you had to learn shoes that must be.

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:49.000
 That must be where they're building, making those shoes in order to have that guy blocking them.

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:52.000
 It's such a good week and we can win every game.

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:54.000
 There could be some six-year-old.

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:57.000
 At worst, he's going to be nil-bil.

00:08:57.000 --> 00:08:59.000
 Yeah, you'd squeeze your feet in.

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:00.000
 He should have done an ugly sister.

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:02.000
 You can bend them over.

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:03.000
 And not apparently most people do.

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:09.000
 Service always say that something like 40% of women say they wear smaller shoes and they should.

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:13.000
 Which again, I'm very skeptical about because I don't really know anyone who doesn't wear their shoe size.

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:18.000
 But do they just claim that their shoes are smaller than they are to seem more dainty?

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:23.000
 No, because they're saying I've got big feet, but I'm wearing small shoes and it's really painful.

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:27.000
 I can't go to a shop and say I'm size three and they're just shoving it on.

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:29.000
 Are you sure? No, no, definitely three.

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:31.000
 Well, they do that as the idea because people are embarrassed.

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:34.000
 So apparently you reach a ceiling at nine as a woman.

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:36.000
 I don't know what it is as a man.

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:41.000
 And however large your feet are above that, you just go for a size nine because it's too embarrassing.

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:42.000
 So a lot of people are angry.

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:44.000
 I think men just like to have bigger feet, don't they?

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:47.000
 They pretend that they're bigger because it's more masculine to have bigger feet.

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:49.000
 Because of that fictional correlation thing.

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:55.000
 Yes, it's really interesting because I sort of vaguely assume that there was something in the foot size to penis size thing.

00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:58.000
 And lots of studies have just found nothing.

00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:00.000
 No correlation, rather.

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:05.000
 There's nothing there.

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:11.000
 It's all based on studies where, so for example, the study of a hundred and four men by a university college London.

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:15.000
 They measured penises when both soft and gently stretched.

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:17.000
 And they found no correlation.

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:21.000
 I actually measured my penis somewhat of those shoe size pieces.

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:24.000
 What do you think you're good for?

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:29.000
 You've been kicked out of so many quarks, branches.

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:34.000
 Okay, who around this table would go back in time to kill Hitler if you could?

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:36.000
 Anyone?

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:37.000
 And you would or not?

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:38.000
 Yes, I would.

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:41.000
 I wouldn't because I understand the butterfly effect.

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:43.000
 If you killed him, none of us would exist.

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:46.000
 Yeah, I read a pen out a novel where this was for you.

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:49.000
 None of the novels don't get me into alternate histories.

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:50.000
 None of them work.

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:57.000
 If you change one thing in history, certainly that long ago, of that magnitude especially, then nobody is the same.

00:10:57.000 --> 00:10:59.000
 Nobody so life now would be alive.

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:01.000
 Because different people would have hooked up.

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:02.000
 Different people would be alive and dead.

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:03.000
 There'd be different children.

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:04.000
 None of us would be here.

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:09.000
 Because my parents both met up over the love of Hitler.

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:12.000
 Yeah, they were both buying Nazi memorabilia, weren't they?

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:17.000
 Because how many people went to war in the Second World War with one partner who then ended up having children with someone else?

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:18.000
 Because they were dead.

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:19.000
 That's the first thing.

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:24.000
 But even if you meet someone a day after or have sex two minutes later, that's a different person coming out.

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:25.000
 Yes, true.

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:30.000
 I just don't think that this podcast is about discussing these huge philosophical questions you've posed, James.

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:31.000
 Okay, well, can I tell you my facts?

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:32.000
 I'm already getting tweeted out.

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:33.000
 Yeah.

00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:38.000
 So the fact is that men are more likely than women to say that they'll go back to kill Hitler.

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:45.000
 And the reason according to psychologists is men prefer utilitarian ideas and women prefer the ontological arguments.

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:48.000
 So men are more likely to do things that help everyone.

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:53.000
 And women are more likely to think, well, actually there are moral reasons why I shouldn't do this particular thing.

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:55.000
 Never mind in what the outcome is.

00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:57.000
 Yeah, so it's always baby Hitler.

00:11:57.000 --> 00:12:01.000
 You go back and kill a bit Hitler as a baby and women are going to go, no, I'm not going to do that.

00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:04.000
 Was I think a few men would like to mind killing a baby?

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:06.000
 Sorry, can I clarify? I'm not in that category.

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:12.000
 I would go back and honorably challenge Hitler when he was at his absolute physical peak.

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:15.000
 What are you going to do?

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:20.000
 How old would you let Hitler get to before you kill him?

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:24.000
 I'd say after his First World War service, I would say.

00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:26.000
 And then it's probably too late because then the Nazi party.

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:30.000
 I think you should aim for probably when you could just about beat him at your current.

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:32.000
 So maybe when he's about 14.

00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:34.000
 Come on.

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:36.000
 Or how can you compete 14 year old Hitler?

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:39.000
 It was pretty weak. He's an age where you couldn't breathe properly.

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:42.000
 Yeah, with those feet though. He just crushed you.

00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:44.000
 Exactly.

00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:49.000
 Sorry, just to clarify, I would actually like to go back to Weimar Germany and improve the social and economic conditions.

00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:55.000
 To the point at which Hitler had no grievance to exploit in the German fight.

00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:57.000
 Such a shame, I'm going to cut this out.

00:12:57.000 --> 00:13:05.000
 Hitler was very unfashionable, apparently.

00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:09.000
 So I was looking to his clothes, starting with shoes and working my way up.

00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:13.000
 He was in 1946, so I was going to say he was very unfashionable.

00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:15.000
 He was quite unfashionable.

00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:17.000
 I'd argue he's still out of fashion a little bit.

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:20.000
 Yeah, his reputation would never come back, has it?

00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:24.000
 He, even in his day, didn't wear very fashionable clothes.

00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:29.000
 So he had a sort of personal valet or valet, who disbared off him, apparently.

00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:37.000
 This is a really weird account from the valet of trying to dress Hitler and saying that he'd lay out new clothes for him every day that would suit him.

00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:39.000
 And then Hitler always refused to wear them.

00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:46.000
 But then weirdly, Nazi chic, as in wearing Nazi clothes, is a thing that's not outrageous in some parts of the world.

00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:52.000
 So I didn't realise this in parts of Asia, so in Thailand, sometimes it gets to the news here that someone's got in trouble in Thailand,

00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:56.000
 because a class of school children will be wearing SS uniforms.

00:13:56.000 --> 00:14:00.000
 And it does happen, and it doesn't have the same associations there as it does here.

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:04.000
 And there was an interview with someone in Thailand, I think, saying it's not really taught as an ideology.

00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:07.000
 It's taught as an objective piece of history.

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:10.000
 And so Nazi outfits have become fancy dress.

00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:11.000
 So it's fancy dress, yeah?

00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:12.000
 Yeah.

00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:17.000
 Whereas they wouldn't wear a Mao Zedong hat, that would be very upsetting.

00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:19.000
 I used to wear that in Sydney.

00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:20.000
 What? Hitler clothes?

00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:22.000
 No, not Hitler clothes.

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:25.000
 We were only in Sydney last year.

00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:28.000
 Who do you think you are, Prince Harry?

00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:35.000
 When I did a trip back to China when I was 18, I bought in Tiananmen Square one of those Mao communist hats.

00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:38.000
 Jesus Christ, that is a whole combination of bad things.

00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:39.000
 You shouldn't have done that.

00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:46.000
 I know. And I, well, this is what's worse. I went canvassing for the Labour Party just before I left the country to move here.

00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:48.000
 And it was a really hot day, and they only had one hat.

00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:51.000
 So I wore that hat while I was handing out the leaflets.

00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:54.000
 And, yeah, they asked me to stop.

00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:56.000
 They haven't been in power since then.

00:14:56.000 --> 00:14:58.000
 I can't picture the Mao Zedong hat.

00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:01.000
 It's a green little army hat with the red star on it.

00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:03.000
 Okay, I do know the one you mean, yeah, yeah.

00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:07.000
 No, no, it's not like I love Mao Zedong kind of cap.

00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:12.000
 The SS uniforms don't say, "I hear Hitler." That wasn't the uniform.

00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:16.000
 I had a Hitler mustache for a year, or a toothbrush mustache for a year.

00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:20.000
 That was the first time I ever saw you. It was the one I got news for you just looking like Hitler.

00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:21.000
 Yeah, why was that again?

00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:26.000
 Well, I was trying to reclaim the mustache for comedy because Charlie Chapman had it before Hitler.

00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:32.000
 And I was just interested in why that symbol has taken the brunt of Hitler's disapproval.

00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:37.000
 There was lots of things he did for having a BMI of 22 point wherever there wasn't that.

00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:39.000
 You're not in trouble for that.

00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:43.000
 And that mustache was very popular before Hitler, and Hitler obviously popularized it as well.

00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:45.000
 A lot of comedians had it first.

00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:47.000
 So I was sort of just interested in the symbolism of it.

00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:50.000
 But then I also then had it for a year, which was a disconcerting.

00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:53.000
 Did you get very bad reactions from some people?

00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:58.000
 Not really. The worst thing that happened, I mean most people laughed at you just the second you'd passed.

00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:04.000
 A few people looked a bit shocked and upset. But the worst thing that happened was I was an old and chepper's bush green

00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:07.000
 at about midnight one night walking along and a man was coming out of a white van.

00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:12.000
 He saw me and went, "Well, I'll make you a man after my own heart," which was just chilling.

00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:18.000
 Like, you know, he was sort of going, "If only I was as brave as you, I would display my Nazism on my face."

00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:19.000
 Well, then he was a Charlie Chaplin fan.

00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:23.000
 He could have been, so you know. That's it. It was all about not making assumptions.

00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:27.000
 But this show was about the importance of voting and an attempt to stop the rise of right wing politics.

00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:30.000
 So, you know, I'm glad comedy works so well.

00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:34.000
 He's just reminded everyone of what they were missing.

00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:45.000
 Okay, it is time for fact number two and that is Chuzinski.

00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:49.000
 My father's week is that in the Indigenous and Mexican language of Chalcatonga Mixtech,

00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:52.000
 it is impossible to ask anyone a question.

00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:55.000
 How did the translation of your emergency questions go down there?

00:16:55.000 --> 00:16:59.000
 I didn't sell any kind of copies out there and now it's explained.

00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:02.000
 That's what it is. Okay, explain.

00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:06.000
 This is the... Sorry, was that a... That was a question.

00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:07.000
 That explains, isn't it?

00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:09.000
 It wasn't meant to be so aggressive.

00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:11.000
 So, Anna, why don't you tell us what you mean?

00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:12.000
 Yeah, there was an order.

00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:15.000
 So, these are researchers at a place or a company called Idebonne,

00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:17.000
 which is a language processing company,

00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:23.000
 and they sort of coded applied code to 239 languages to look at how they worked.

00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:27.000
 So, to look at things like how you order subjects and objects and verbs

00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:33.000
 and how a language makes clear things like an order or a negative or a positive or a question.

00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:39.000
 And Chalcatonga Mixtech is spoken by about 6,000 people in Mexico

00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:44.000
 and it was determined to be the most unusual language in the world.

00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:48.000
 So, it shares fewer things with any other languages than any other languages

00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:51.000
 and there was no mechanism for showing you asking a question.

00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:55.000
 There's no way of saying, are you all right, as opposed to, you're all right?

00:17:55.000 --> 00:17:57.000
 But there's also.

00:17:57.000 --> 00:18:01.000
 There's no difference between saying, are you all right and you are all right?

00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:03.000
 Yeah, you're a bit of all right.

00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:06.000
 They're not actually cracking onto each other constantly.

00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:08.000
 I was just trying to sex it up.

00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:11.000
 But there's no way. There's no way of saying to someone,

00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:14.000
 do you fancy a drink? Would you like to get married?

00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:16.000
 And then would you like to have some children,

00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:19.000
 which is presumably why only 6,000 people in the world speak it?

00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:21.000
 Yeah, you have to just kind of...

00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:23.000
 Do you, Andrew Hunter Murray, take this one?

00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:25.000
 Sorry, I don't know what it's all about.

00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:28.000
 It's very demanding because it's always, it would all be you fancy a drink.

00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:29.000
 You want to marry me.

00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:30.000
 Yeah.

00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:35.000
 So, just, the only people who are getting married are very aggressive men and very polite women.

00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:37.000
 Okay, I agree.

00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:41.000
 Why can't they just go up at the end of the statement to make a question?

00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:42.000
 That's why can't they?

00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:45.000
 I know they do tones, but that's, I mean, the problem in the UK

00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:47.000
 is that people do that with non-questions now, don't they?

00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:48.000
 Yeah.

00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:49.000
 You're going, yeah.

00:18:49.000 --> 00:18:51.000
 Just everything goes up at the end of the sentence.

00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:53.000
 But that would be the solution for these people to be able to ask questions.

00:18:53.000 --> 00:18:55.000
 But I guess it's not a problem.

00:18:55.000 --> 00:18:56.000
 I guess they could.

00:18:56.000 --> 00:18:57.000
 They don't mind.

00:18:57.000 --> 00:18:58.000
 They don't want to ask questions.

00:18:58.000 --> 00:18:59.000
 They don't want to know.

00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:00.000
 They're very uncurious, they do.

00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:02.000
 There must be one question in the need, which is,

00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:03.000
 are you asking or are you telling?

00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:04.000
 That's the question.

00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:08.000
 That's made for them.

00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:11.000
 All you need, you're right.

00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:16.000
 But that's one of the things which makes English so weird is that we flip order to make a question.

00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:17.000
 Yes.

00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:18.000
 It is true.

00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:19.000
 Is it true?

00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:20.000
 Yeah.

00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:23.000
 And then Japanese has, for example, the word you just add, you just add a particle.

00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:25.000
 And that is a magical transforming particle.

00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:28.000
 So, car is that in Japanese.

00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:30.000
 So, so does car means, is that so?

00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:31.000
 Yeah.

00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:32.000
 And that's multiple common, isn't it?

00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:33.000
 Yeah, yeah.

00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:35.000
 So, I think only 2% of languages do the word switching.

00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:36.000
 Right.

00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:38.000
 Dutch is another one, very unusual.

00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:40.000
 So, we are quite special in that way.

00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:41.000
 Yeah.

00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:43.000
 Do you know what the second least weird language is?

00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:44.000
 Least weird.

00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:45.000
 Yeah.

00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:47.000
 So, the most normal after Hindi.

00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:48.000
 Hindi is the most normal.

00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:49.000
 I'll say Welsh.

00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:52.000
 There's a language called 'purepecha', which is another Mexican language.

00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:56.000
 And the third least weird language to the third most normal language.

00:19:56.000 --> 00:19:57.000
 I'll say Welsh.

00:19:57.000 --> 00:20:00.000
 It's, yeah, you're going to keep firing, are you?

00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:02.000
 I'm going to be Mexican, Mexican, Mexican.

00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:04.000
 I'm rather than Wales, actually.

00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:06.000
 I'm afraid it's 'I' new.

00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:09.000
 Which we've talked about before, but we've spoken by about 10 people.

00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:10.000
 That's Japanese.

00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:13.000
 That's Japanese and Hokkaido in Japan.

00:20:13.000 --> 00:20:17.000
 So, that's one of the most normal languages spoken by about 10 people.

00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:20.000
 I know Hindi is the most normal language, and that's spoken by what?

00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:21.000
 Nearly a billion people.

00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:22.000
 Yeah.

00:20:22.000 --> 00:20:23.000
 Yeah.

00:20:23.000 --> 00:20:29.000
 Hindi has one unusual feature that they found, and that is something called 'predictive possessions'.

00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:35.000
 So, you can say 'Anna has a glass of wine', or you can say 'the glass of wine is 'Anna's',

00:20:35.000 --> 00:20:38.000
 but you can't say 'Anna's glass of wine' in Hindi.

00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:41.000
 You kind of have the possessive, I think.

00:20:41.000 --> 00:20:43.000
 That's the only thing that's weird in Hindi.

00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:46.000
 Have you guys heard of the Indonesian Riau dialect?

00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:47.000
 Nope.

00:20:47.000 --> 00:20:48.000
 No, this is a great one.

00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:54.000
 So, this is claimed by the linguist John McWater to be the most economical language in the world.

00:20:54.000 --> 00:21:00.000
 So, there's a phrase 'I am macam', and that just means 'chicken eat'.

00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:05.000
 But it can also mean, variously, the chicken is eating, chickens are eating,

00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:09.000
 a chicken is eating, the chicken is eating, the chicken will be eating,

00:21:09.000 --> 00:21:13.000
 the chicken eats, the chicken has eaten, someone is eating the chicken,

00:21:13.000 --> 00:21:17.000
 someone is eating with the chicken, chicken that is eating,

00:21:17.000 --> 00:21:21.000
 and when the chicken is eating, and for others, who's eating with the chicken?

00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:25.000
 That's the same stuff as the chicken, or are they just eating?

00:21:25.000 --> 00:21:28.000
 They are factoring at a restaurant as well.

00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:29.000
 I have the chicken.

00:21:29.000 --> 00:21:30.000
 Oh, well.

00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:33.000
 Sorry, you've just been eaten by a chicken?

00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:36.000
 It's a language of sitcoms, isn't it?

00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:38.000
 Yes, yes, yes.

00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:42.000
 I wanted to eat with the chicken, have you killed it?

00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:45.000
 So, it's economical, but no one has any idea what anyone else means.

00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:46.000
 I think so, yeah.

00:21:46.000 --> 00:21:47.000
 Great.

00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:48.000
 It's incredible.

00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:51.000
 The really cool language I like is the 'yup-no' language in Papua,

00:21:51.000 --> 00:21:54.000
 which is where everything is conceived, everything directionally,

00:21:54.000 --> 00:21:59.000
 when we'd say go over there, or whatever, is conceived in terms of uphill and downhill.

00:21:59.000 --> 00:22:03.000
 So, for instance, if you're talking about where the door is,

00:22:03.000 --> 00:22:08.000
 you'll say, oh, it's just uphill, or if I was saying, oh, whereabouts is James now?

00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:09.000
 Oh, he's just downhill.

00:22:09.000 --> 00:22:11.000
 And everything is uphill and downhill.

00:22:11.000 --> 00:22:17.000
 So, if I'm downhill from you, how do I know whether I'm uphill or downhill?

00:22:17.000 --> 00:22:20.000
 So, there, they have, because it's quite a small place,

00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:24.000
 they have a certain geography where everyone kind of knows where the highest point in the island is,

00:22:24.000 --> 00:22:25.000
 and the area is.

00:22:25.000 --> 00:22:26.000
 Everyone knows where the lowest point.

00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:31.000
 If you're talking about time, then the, oh, the fireplace is always downhill, apparently.

00:22:31.000 --> 00:22:34.000
 So, if you're in a room, you have to check where the fireplace is.

00:22:34.000 --> 00:22:37.000
 So, I guess, behind me, at the moment, is the Thames.

00:22:37.000 --> 00:22:39.000
 So, all of the land kind of goes towards a Thames.

00:22:39.000 --> 00:22:43.000
 So, you could argue that I'm downhill of you, even if I'm not quite done.

00:22:43.000 --> 00:22:45.000
 Yeah, unless there's a fireplace on the opposite side of the room.

00:22:45.000 --> 00:22:47.000
 And then that trumps the Thames.

00:22:47.000 --> 00:22:51.000
 And then you're uphill, so the fireplace is always the trumping card.

00:22:51.000 --> 00:22:53.000
 I think the fireplace is the trump card, yes.

00:22:53.000 --> 00:22:57.000
 Unless you're talking about time, in which case, the past is always downhill,

00:22:57.000 --> 00:22:58.000
 and the future is uphill.

00:22:58.000 --> 00:23:00.000
 So, what is that?

00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:02.000
 It used to be a fireplace salesman.

00:23:02.000 --> 00:23:04.000
 On the Thames.

00:23:04.000 --> 00:23:09.000
 And an Aboriginal language, which I was reading about, that I didn't write down,

00:23:09.000 --> 00:23:13.000
 but they judge everything by Northeast South and West.

00:23:13.000 --> 00:23:14.000
 That's the direction of everything.

00:23:14.000 --> 00:23:15.000
 Yeah, wow.

00:23:15.000 --> 00:23:17.000
 I think, yeah, that's a lot of Australian Aboriginal language.

00:23:17.000 --> 00:23:18.000
 Yeah, exactly.

00:23:18.000 --> 00:23:19.000
 It's easy to know, though.

00:23:19.000 --> 00:23:20.000
 Well, you have to know where you are.

00:23:20.000 --> 00:23:22.000
 You have to know where you are all the time.

00:23:22.000 --> 00:23:24.000
 You can't do any other directions than Northeast South and West.

00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:30.000
 But there was a study where they did an investigation where they looked at an Aboriginal person

00:23:30.000 --> 00:23:32.000
 who had then gone to a different country.

00:23:32.000 --> 00:23:36.000
 And they realised that instinctively that person still knew always what was Northeast South and West.

00:23:36.000 --> 00:23:37.000
 Oh, no way.

00:23:37.000 --> 00:23:39.000
 So they instinctively orienting themselves.

00:23:39.000 --> 00:23:40.000
 That iPhone.

00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:41.000
 Not sure.

00:23:41.000 --> 00:23:44.000
 That's right.

00:23:44.000 --> 00:23:45.000
 Another language, another cool language.

00:23:45.000 --> 00:23:46.000
 Yeah.

00:23:46.000 --> 00:23:53.000
 Okay, so this language is called Kiche, and it was spoken by the Mayans in Guatemala.

00:23:53.000 --> 00:23:57.000
 And what I love about this is if you're speaking to children,

00:23:57.000 --> 00:24:01.000
 normally humans would kind of, in most languages, would kind of talk a little bit higher,

00:24:01.000 --> 00:24:02.000
 like a bit higher like that.

00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:07.000
 And if you're speaking to someone, if you're speaking to someone who's a higher status than you,

00:24:07.000 --> 00:24:08.000
 you speak lower.

00:24:08.000 --> 00:24:10.000
 But in their language, it's complete with the opposite.

00:24:10.000 --> 00:24:14.000
 So when you're speaking to someone of a higher status,

00:24:14.000 --> 00:24:16.000
 you put your voice in a higher pitch.

00:24:16.000 --> 00:24:17.000
 I think that's amazing.

00:24:17.000 --> 00:24:18.000
 That's cool.

00:24:18.000 --> 00:24:19.000
 I want to do that.

00:24:19.000 --> 00:24:23.000
 When you meet the Queen itself, very nice to meet you.

00:24:23.000 --> 00:24:25.000
 Are you lost, little girl?

00:24:25.000 --> 00:24:27.000
 It's very creepy.

00:24:27.000 --> 00:24:29.000
 Creepy to the point, stupid.

00:24:29.000 --> 00:24:35.000
 I like this language called Tamayek, or Tamajek, spoken by the tour reg.

00:24:35.000 --> 00:24:40.000
 And they, so 1984, there was the Prince song Purple Rain.

00:24:40.000 --> 00:24:42.000
 There was also the movie Purple Rain.

00:24:42.000 --> 00:24:46.000
 They did a remake of that movie 30 years later.

00:24:46.000 --> 00:24:49.000
 So the exact movie, it was just a remake in their language.

00:24:49.000 --> 00:24:52.000
 Unfortunately, in their language, they don't have a word for purple.

00:24:52.000 --> 00:24:59.000
 So the movie was released as Rain the Color of Blue with a little red in it.

00:24:59.000 --> 00:25:05.000
 With the Piraha Brazil language, well, someone claimed has no numbers or colors in it.

00:25:05.000 --> 00:25:09.000
 So by 20-month-old son could go there and rule the place.

00:25:09.000 --> 00:25:11.000
 Pretty much all he can do.

00:25:11.000 --> 00:25:13.000
 You can't place snooker, can you?

00:25:13.000 --> 00:25:17.000
 No, and also, which I don't understand, someone says, but this is controversial.

00:25:17.000 --> 00:25:24.000
 It's the only language with no recursive, no recursion in it, which is the ability to insert phrases into phrases.

00:25:24.000 --> 00:25:27.000
 But I didn't quite grasp what that was.

00:25:27.000 --> 00:25:30.000
 What you can't, you can't put a phrase in a phrase.

00:25:30.000 --> 00:25:33.000
 You can't say Daniel Fucking Shriver, is that what it is?

00:25:33.000 --> 00:25:35.000
 It's something along those lines.

00:25:35.000 --> 00:25:38.000
 I think that's something we should adopt in the English language.

00:25:38.000 --> 00:25:42.000
 These guys, Piraha has a really cool, so their language is one of the most tonal languages.

00:25:42.000 --> 00:25:45.000
 So it's different kind of tones as you're speaking.

00:25:45.000 --> 00:25:54.000
 And so a word which is ha-papa-i, you can pronounce that kapa-papa-i, or ha-ha-i, or kaka-i.

00:25:54.000 --> 00:25:58.000
 It doesn't matter what the consonants are, it's just the tones.

00:25:58.000 --> 00:26:03.000
 And so it means that you could kind of talk with your mouth full, or you can whistle words and stuff like that.

00:26:03.000 --> 00:26:06.000
 Because it's just about the tones, it's not about the consonants.

00:26:06.000 --> 00:26:11.000
 Because it's like you've got blank scrabble tiles that you can just put into the words.

00:26:11.000 --> 00:26:15.000
 As you wish, as long as you get the bits in between, right?

00:26:15.000 --> 00:26:16.000
 Sure.

00:26:16.000 --> 00:26:18.000
 It's a bit like that.

00:26:18.000 --> 00:26:25.000
 So when I was saying ha-papa-i, it's the same as saying a-i-i, or whatever.

00:26:25.000 --> 00:26:29.000
 So no matter what kind of tone you make, that's the thing.

00:26:29.000 --> 00:26:30.000
 That's very cool.

00:26:30.000 --> 00:26:33.000
 I like the scrabble analogy though, I think that really worked well.

00:26:33.000 --> 00:26:34.000
 Oh, thanks.

00:26:34.000 --> 00:26:36.000
 Sorry, Andy.

00:26:36.000 --> 00:26:37.000
 I just didn't know.

00:26:37.000 --> 00:26:39.000
 I simply didn't understand.

00:26:39.000 --> 00:26:42.000
 James, it simply didn't make sense.

00:26:42.000 --> 00:26:47.000
 This is about linguistics, right?

00:26:47.000 --> 00:26:49.000
 And so it's about language.

00:26:49.000 --> 00:26:51.000
 We don't want language, how it's evolved.

00:26:51.000 --> 00:26:53.000
 Just get to your very tenuously linked thing.

00:26:53.000 --> 00:26:57.000
 Well, it's only because I was reading some known Chomsky stuff,

00:26:57.000 --> 00:27:00.000
 who is obviously very related to like how language evolves.

00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:02.000
 And I hate him.

00:27:02.000 --> 00:27:03.000
 Wow.

00:27:03.000 --> 00:27:04.000
 I think he's so miserable.

00:27:04.000 --> 00:27:06.000
 That's too much wine for Anna.

00:27:06.000 --> 00:27:09.000
 And we can't get in another celebrity feud.

00:27:09.000 --> 00:27:10.000
 Not with known Chomsky.

00:27:10.000 --> 00:27:14.000
 It's always after two glass of wine, she's such a slimy, known Chomsky.

00:27:14.000 --> 00:27:16.000
 It's every time, fucking known.

00:27:16.000 --> 00:27:18.000
 He feels the same about me, it's fine.

00:27:18.000 --> 00:27:21.000
 But so no, even Chomsky is obviously like father of linguistics.

00:27:21.000 --> 00:27:24.000
 It's amazing, like Einstein forget in the linguistics world.

00:27:24.000 --> 00:27:25.000
 So I was on this linguistics forum.

00:27:25.000 --> 00:27:27.000
 I was just looking at how language is evolved.

00:27:27.000 --> 00:27:31.000
 And this forum put a big Chomsky quote at the top.

00:27:31.000 --> 00:27:33.000
 And it was about the first article he'd ever written.

00:27:33.000 --> 00:27:35.000
 So he wrote his first article when he was ten years old.

00:27:35.000 --> 00:27:40.000
 And it was about the, he was like the fascist forces of conquered Barcelona.

00:27:40.000 --> 00:27:42.000
 Essentially the end of the Spanish Civil War.

00:27:42.000 --> 00:27:44.000
 And it was all about the spread of Nazi power and stuff.

00:27:44.000 --> 00:27:45.000
 This guy was ten.

00:27:45.000 --> 00:27:47.000
 So it's the top of this forum, this academic forum.

00:27:47.000 --> 00:27:49.000
 This person posts this quote from him.

00:27:49.000 --> 00:27:50.000
 And it's like thoughts guys.

00:27:50.000 --> 00:27:52.000
 And the comment immediately below it was.

00:27:52.000 --> 00:27:54.000
 That sounds incredibly boring.

00:27:54.000 --> 00:27:57.000
 And then the comment below that was, when I was ten,

00:27:57.000 --> 00:28:01.000
 I wrote about an evil jackalant and that terrorized kids on Halloween.

00:28:01.000 --> 00:28:03.000
 But he had a heart of gold and was just misunderstood.

00:28:03.000 --> 00:28:06.000
 And then the entire rest of the thread

00:28:06.000 --> 00:28:08.000
 is them analysing the jackalant.

00:28:08.000 --> 00:28:12.000
 It does sound a lot better.

00:28:12.000 --> 00:28:13.000
 Doesn't it?

00:28:13.000 --> 00:28:14.000
 Sounds amazing.

00:28:14.000 --> 00:28:15.000
 You'd rather read that.

00:28:15.000 --> 00:28:16.000
 Definitely.

00:28:16.000 --> 00:28:17.000
 Yeah.

00:28:17.000 --> 00:28:18.000
 Good on them.

00:28:18.000 --> 00:28:26.000
 Okay, it's time for fact number three.

00:28:26.000 --> 00:28:28.000
 And that is Andy.

00:28:28.000 --> 00:28:31.000
 My fact is that King George III once went to a safety demonstration

00:28:31.000 --> 00:28:34.000
 which involved putting the king in a house and setting it on fire.

00:28:34.000 --> 00:28:35.000
 Wow.

00:28:35.000 --> 00:28:36.000
 Yeah.

00:28:36.000 --> 00:28:37.000
 That doesn't sound very safe.

00:28:37.000 --> 00:28:40.000
 Well, that was, I guess, that's the, that's the trick, isn't it?

00:28:40.000 --> 00:28:41.000
 That was the safety demonstration.

00:28:41.000 --> 00:28:42.000
 You'd try and do something.

00:28:42.000 --> 00:28:43.000
 It looks unsafe.

00:28:43.000 --> 00:28:44.000
 You say, "I've tricked you."

00:28:44.000 --> 00:28:45.000
 And he survived, right?

00:28:45.000 --> 00:28:48.000
 The King survived for another 40 years, nearly.

00:28:48.000 --> 00:28:50.000
 He's the longest-raining king.

00:28:50.000 --> 00:28:52.000
 He's the longest-raining king.

00:28:52.000 --> 00:28:55.000
 Yeah, only Victoria and Elizabeth are both queens.

00:28:55.000 --> 00:28:56.000
 Oh, he did.

00:28:56.000 --> 00:28:58.000
 He was 59 years.

00:28:58.000 --> 00:28:59.000
 He was 59 years old.

00:28:59.000 --> 00:29:01.000
 60 days or something.

00:29:01.000 --> 00:29:02.000
 He was the Kingful.

00:29:02.000 --> 00:29:03.000
 Wow.

00:29:03.000 --> 00:29:05.000
 Although, he wasn't very good at it.

00:29:05.000 --> 00:29:06.000
 Was he?

00:29:06.000 --> 00:29:08.000
 Well, he lost America.

00:29:08.000 --> 00:29:10.000
 He's been reassessed, I think.

00:29:10.000 --> 00:29:11.000
 That's a little bit over the years.

00:29:11.000 --> 00:29:13.000
 I mean, I think he got a bad rap at the time.

00:29:13.000 --> 00:29:15.000
 I mean, he was speaking of bad rap.

00:29:15.000 --> 00:29:16.000
 So, have you seen Hamilton?

00:29:16.000 --> 00:29:21.000
 I hear he's meant to be the best thing in Hamilton.

00:29:21.000 --> 00:29:23.000
 Oh, he's so good in it.

00:29:23.000 --> 00:29:25.000
 But it's not him.

00:29:25.000 --> 00:29:26.000
 He is dead now.

00:29:26.000 --> 00:29:29.000
 So, he had extreme safety of the demonstration.

00:29:29.000 --> 00:29:30.000
 And his long reign.

00:29:30.000 --> 00:29:33.000
 It couldn't keep him alive past the age of about AC,

00:29:33.000 --> 00:29:34.000
 which he made it to.

00:29:34.000 --> 00:29:35.000
 A lot of stuff went on in his...

00:29:35.000 --> 00:29:36.000
 I was surprised, actually.

00:29:36.000 --> 00:29:39.000
 I don't know very much about that period of history,

00:29:39.000 --> 00:29:40.000
 even though I studied history.

00:29:40.000 --> 00:29:42.000
 And I was surprised how much happened in his reign.

00:29:42.000 --> 00:29:44.000
 And yeah, he lost a lot of stuff.

00:29:44.000 --> 00:29:46.000
 As well as the plot in the main thing,

00:29:46.000 --> 00:29:48.000
 which was actually very sad, wasn't it?

00:29:48.000 --> 00:29:50.000
 So, he did go very mad.

00:29:50.000 --> 00:29:53.000
 His illness was diagnosed as flying out.

00:29:53.000 --> 00:29:54.000
 Wow.

00:29:54.000 --> 00:29:57.000
 Can I just say I think Andy is desperate to tell us a story

00:29:57.000 --> 00:29:58.000
 of this house on fire.

00:29:58.000 --> 00:29:59.000
 No, no, we don't.

00:29:59.000 --> 00:30:02.000
 We can go into the broader sociological implications of his reign.

00:30:02.000 --> 00:30:06.000
 Does this such an exciting story about the claiming house?

00:30:06.000 --> 00:30:08.000
 Andy, please, back to the burning building.

00:30:08.000 --> 00:30:09.000
 Yeah, yeah.

00:30:09.000 --> 00:30:10.000
 How does that happen?

00:30:10.000 --> 00:30:12.000
 So, I should tell you where this comes from.

00:30:12.000 --> 00:30:14.000
 This is a book called 1776, A London Chronicle,

00:30:14.000 --> 00:30:17.000
 which is all about only stuff happening in 1776.

00:30:17.000 --> 00:30:18.000
 Very busy year.

00:30:18.000 --> 00:30:19.000
 Lots of innovations.

00:30:19.000 --> 00:30:20.000
 Lots of stuff going on.

00:30:20.000 --> 00:30:22.000
 The American colonies on the brink of being lost.

00:30:22.000 --> 00:30:23.000
 All of this stuff.

00:30:23.000 --> 00:30:25.000
 And there was a scientist called David Hartley,

00:30:25.000 --> 00:30:28.000
 who had this amazing new way of making a house fireproof.

00:30:28.000 --> 00:30:31.000
 And it basically just involved putting iron plates in it

00:30:31.000 --> 00:30:34.000
 all the way through, like a magician and a box.

00:30:34.000 --> 00:30:35.000
 Yeah.

00:30:35.000 --> 00:30:38.000
 So, the king stood upstairs and flaming pitch

00:30:38.000 --> 00:30:40.000
 destroyed the lower half of the house,

00:30:40.000 --> 00:30:41.000
 and he was absolutely fine.

00:30:41.000 --> 00:30:43.000
 And this happened on the very day

00:30:43.000 --> 00:30:47.000
 that the news reached London of the American Declaration of Independence.

00:30:47.000 --> 00:30:50.000
 So, it was like it was a big day for daughter third.

00:30:50.000 --> 00:30:51.000
 Wow, wow.

00:30:51.000 --> 00:30:53.000
 It's like you sport the day.

00:30:53.000 --> 00:30:54.000
 That didn't even happen.

00:30:54.000 --> 00:30:55.000
 It's a great day.

00:30:55.000 --> 00:30:57.000
 Up to the upstairs and a burning house and a fire.

00:30:57.000 --> 00:31:00.000
 What's been happening while I've gone?

00:31:00.000 --> 00:31:03.000
 The guy you just talked about, David Hartley.

00:31:03.000 --> 00:31:07.000
 He has a sort of long lasting legacy around the world.

00:31:07.000 --> 00:31:09.000
 And, you know, we're here in the West End.

00:31:09.000 --> 00:31:12.000
 He is the person who invented the fire curtain

00:31:12.000 --> 00:31:14.000
 that goes down in front of Stages.

00:31:14.000 --> 00:31:15.000
 Yeah.

00:31:15.000 --> 00:31:17.000
 He hated fire, didn't he?

00:31:17.000 --> 00:31:20.000
 Yes.

00:31:20.000 --> 00:31:21.000
 What's his problem with fire?

00:31:21.000 --> 00:31:22.000
 Let it fire.

00:31:22.000 --> 00:31:23.000
 Have a few fires.

00:31:23.000 --> 00:31:26.000
 He was thought of as an eccentric

00:31:26.000 --> 00:31:29.000
 because he didn't powder his hair when everyone else did.

00:31:29.000 --> 00:31:30.000
 Oh, man.

00:31:30.000 --> 00:31:31.000
 Who George the Third or David Hartley?

00:31:31.000 --> 00:31:32.000
 David Hartley.

00:31:32.000 --> 00:31:35.000
 George the Third was thought as quite eccentric as well.

00:31:35.000 --> 00:31:36.000
 Yes, but other reasons.

00:31:36.000 --> 00:31:38.000
 He also wore stockings with a feet cut out

00:31:38.000 --> 00:31:40.000
 because he thought it was healthier.

00:31:40.000 --> 00:31:43.000
 And that made you an eccentric in those days.

00:31:43.000 --> 00:31:44.000
 Wow.

00:31:44.000 --> 00:31:45.000
 That isn't interesting.

00:31:45.000 --> 00:31:46.000
 You didn't need to do much, did you?

00:31:46.000 --> 00:31:48.000
 To be called an eccentric now,

00:31:48.000 --> 00:31:50.000
 you need to work pretty damn hard.

00:31:50.000 --> 00:31:51.000
 I've been trying for years.

00:31:51.000 --> 00:31:52.000
 Yeah.

00:31:52.000 --> 00:31:54.000
 And the house became popular.

00:31:54.000 --> 00:31:56.000
 And was used throughout England.

00:31:56.000 --> 00:31:58.000
 You know, the plates methods spread across the country.

00:31:58.000 --> 00:32:02.000
 But then other methods took over which were more efficient

00:32:02.000 --> 00:32:04.000
 and didn't involve putting huge iron plates all the way

00:32:04.000 --> 00:32:05.000
 to the house.

00:32:05.000 --> 00:32:07.000
 And then the original house, the test house,

00:32:07.000 --> 00:32:09.000
 a very sadly caught fire.

00:32:09.000 --> 00:32:10.000
 No.

00:32:10.000 --> 00:32:11.000
 Yeah.

00:32:11.000 --> 00:32:13.000
 It had been extended beyond the safe bit.

00:32:13.000 --> 00:32:14.000
 You know, so it was an extension.

00:32:14.000 --> 00:32:15.000
 Yeah.

00:32:15.000 --> 00:32:17.000
 So that extension caught fire and then collapsed

00:32:17.000 --> 00:32:18.000
 onto the fire proof section.

00:32:18.000 --> 00:32:19.000
 Oh.

00:32:19.000 --> 00:32:20.000
 And then that caught fire.

00:32:20.000 --> 00:32:22.000
 You needed some iron plates on the top to stop that.

00:32:22.000 --> 00:32:23.000
 Yeah.

00:32:23.000 --> 00:32:26.000
 How do you talk a king into standing in a flaming house?

00:32:26.000 --> 00:32:27.000
 I don't know.

00:32:27.000 --> 00:32:28.000
 If he's mad, it's easy.

00:32:28.000 --> 00:32:29.000
 That's correct.

00:32:29.000 --> 00:32:31.000
 They got the right king.

00:32:31.000 --> 00:32:32.000
 You're right.

00:32:32.000 --> 00:32:33.000
 Yeah.

00:32:33.000 --> 00:32:35.000
 And I think he was going a bit mad around that time.

00:32:35.000 --> 00:32:38.000
 He had a few bouts of madness through his life.

00:32:38.000 --> 00:32:40.000
 One of them was just before the French Revolution.

00:32:40.000 --> 00:32:42.000
 So that must have been sort of around the bad words.

00:32:42.000 --> 00:32:45.000
 There's a bit later than that.

00:32:45.000 --> 00:32:46.000
 Yeah.

00:32:46.000 --> 00:32:49.000
 When he did start to lose his mind, at one stage in 1819,

00:32:49.000 --> 00:32:53.000
 he spoke nonsense nonstop for 58 hours.

00:32:53.000 --> 00:32:55.000
 It was at Christmas time as well, that one.

00:32:55.000 --> 00:32:56.000
 Yeah.

00:32:56.000 --> 00:32:59.000
 Which, you know, that happens at my house with my dad.

00:32:59.000 --> 00:33:03.000
 It also says it was a bit racist.

00:33:03.000 --> 00:33:04.000
 Going on about Brexit.

00:33:04.000 --> 00:33:07.000
 That's not what I'm talking about.

00:33:07.000 --> 00:33:08.000
 Yeah.

00:33:08.000 --> 00:33:10.000
 It sounds like he really, really suffered.

00:33:10.000 --> 00:33:13.000
 And obviously it wasn't understood nearly as much at the time.

00:33:13.000 --> 00:33:15.000
 So, you know, he has this reputation.

00:33:15.000 --> 00:33:17.000
 But he did, obviously, huge amount of stuff.

00:33:17.000 --> 00:33:18.000
 He was a very interesting guy.

00:33:18.000 --> 00:33:19.000
 He was a hobbyist.

00:33:19.000 --> 00:33:23.000
 He wrote architectural journal articles under a pen name secretly.

00:33:23.000 --> 00:33:24.000
 Did he?

00:33:24.000 --> 00:33:26.000
 He was interested in all sorts of stuff.

00:33:26.000 --> 00:33:31.000
 Yeah, he had a huge capacity for wanting to know what was going on in his kingdom, I think.

00:33:31.000 --> 00:33:32.000
 Yeah.

00:33:32.000 --> 00:33:36.000
 He had a weird marriage to a woman called Charlotte.

00:33:36.000 --> 00:33:41.000
 Charlotte of a Mecklenburg Strelitz, who was from this random German Dutchy.

00:33:41.000 --> 00:33:46.000
 And she was very parsimonious, no, it's been parsimonious.

00:33:46.000 --> 00:33:50.000
 The only remnant we have of her is a dish called Apple Charlotte, apparently.

00:33:50.000 --> 00:33:54.000
 And that Apple Charlotte is a pudding that uses up stale bread,

00:33:54.000 --> 00:33:57.000
 because she didn't want to waste anything.

00:33:57.000 --> 00:34:03.000
 And she used to stamp butter with the royal signet so that the servants couldn't eat it to say this is our butter.

00:34:03.000 --> 00:34:04.000
 Wow.

00:34:04.000 --> 00:34:05.000
 Don't touch.

00:34:05.000 --> 00:34:08.000
 She was famously ugly and there was a quote about her.

00:34:08.000 --> 00:34:11.000
 This is suddenly tipped over into personal opinions.

00:34:11.000 --> 00:34:16.000
 Sometimes I feel like women haven't taken enough flak in history.

00:34:16.000 --> 00:34:19.000
 And we've got a sense of abuse there way.

00:34:19.000 --> 00:34:21.000
 So she was famously hideous.

00:34:21.000 --> 00:34:24.000
 And one of the nability said that as she got older, this is a famous quote,

00:34:24.000 --> 00:34:29.000
 is that as she got older, the bloom has at any rate gone off the queen's ugliness.

00:34:29.000 --> 00:34:33.000
 Since she fell off this carriage and broke her nose, she's actually quite handsome.

00:34:33.000 --> 00:34:34.000
 Wow.

00:34:34.000 --> 00:34:35.000
 Yeah.

00:34:35.000 --> 00:34:37.000
 But you married her the day you met her, didn't you?

00:34:37.000 --> 00:34:38.000
 Yes, I remember.

00:34:38.000 --> 00:34:42.000
 And he was baptised on the day he was born, because he was two months premature,

00:34:42.000 --> 00:34:46.000
 which at the time was like, you know, definitely you're going to die.

00:34:46.000 --> 00:34:47.000
 But he survived.

00:34:47.000 --> 00:34:49.000
 But they had a very happy marriage.

00:34:49.000 --> 00:34:52.000
 He was faithful to her, which you know, if you've got what's the point of being king.

00:34:52.000 --> 00:34:55.000
 If you're going to be faithful to your wife, that's the point.

00:34:55.000 --> 00:34:56.000
 Yeah.

00:34:56.000 --> 00:34:57.000
 And they had like 15 children.

00:34:57.000 --> 00:34:58.000
 Okay.

00:34:58.000 --> 00:35:01.000
 So I'm just, I'm just almost making this up, I think.

00:35:01.000 --> 00:35:06.000
 But I thought that in his madness, he actually did have a fair as off the back of

00:35:06.000 --> 00:35:08.000
 he was just in a hypostate.

00:35:08.000 --> 00:35:09.000
 Right.

00:35:09.000 --> 00:35:10.000
 He wasn't really aware.

00:35:10.000 --> 00:35:11.000
 Oh, though.

00:35:11.000 --> 00:35:14.000
 And I think he was, when he properly was mad, he was like in his 70s and 80s.

00:35:14.000 --> 00:35:16.000
 So I don't think he would have been much of a threat.

00:35:16.000 --> 00:35:17.000
 And he was blind.

00:35:17.000 --> 00:35:19.000
 So I don't, I think he might have.

00:35:19.000 --> 00:35:22.000
 I got a lot of affairs with balls.

00:35:22.000 --> 00:35:23.000
 And he shook hands with the tree.

00:35:23.000 --> 00:35:24.000
 And he fell asleep.

00:35:24.000 --> 00:35:25.000
 Oh, that's true.

00:35:25.000 --> 00:35:26.000
 He did.

00:35:26.000 --> 00:35:29.000
 So, you know, we might have been having affairs with Flora and Horn.

00:35:29.000 --> 00:35:30.000
 Yeah.

00:35:30.000 --> 00:35:31.000
 Yeah.

00:35:31.000 --> 00:35:32.000
 Yeah, I don't know.

00:35:32.000 --> 00:35:34.000
 He definitely did get off with her a lot.

00:35:34.000 --> 00:35:35.000
 Yeah.

00:35:35.000 --> 00:35:36.000
 15 children.

00:35:36.000 --> 00:35:37.000
 Well, nine boys.

00:35:37.000 --> 00:35:39.000
 It's like, he stayed faithful to one woman, had 15 children.

00:35:39.000 --> 00:35:41.000
 It's a real fuck you to King Henry VIII, doesn't it?

00:35:41.000 --> 00:35:42.000
 Yeah.

00:35:42.000 --> 00:35:43.000
 Just stick with one.

00:35:43.000 --> 00:35:44.000
 Let's keep plowing away.

00:35:44.000 --> 00:35:48.000
 And only one, I think 13 of his children survived into adulthood.

00:35:48.000 --> 00:35:49.000
 Yeah.

00:35:49.000 --> 00:35:50.000
 I think so.

00:35:50.000 --> 00:35:51.000
 Yeah.

00:35:51.000 --> 00:35:53.000
 But he later refused his daughter's the ability to marry.

00:35:53.000 --> 00:35:56.000
 He was, he was, he was really happy with his wife.

00:35:56.000 --> 00:36:01.000
 But I think he was so worried about them making unsuitable marriages that only three of his daughter's

00:36:01.000 --> 00:36:04.000
 managed to marry in the end, just because he was such a tyrant about it.

00:36:04.000 --> 00:36:09.000
 And he passed a law saying that if you were a royal eight under 25, you could not marry without the

00:36:09.000 --> 00:36:11.000
 express permission of the ruling sovereign.

00:36:11.000 --> 00:36:14.000
 And that law stayed in place until 2013.

00:36:14.000 --> 00:36:15.000
 Really?

00:36:15.000 --> 00:36:16.000
 Yeah.

00:36:16.000 --> 00:36:17.000
 Yeah.

00:36:17.000 --> 00:36:22.000
 Yeah, I think he was skeptical about marriage because his sister's marriage had gone very badly.

00:36:22.000 --> 00:36:27.000
 So his sister was Caroline Matilde and she'd married a guy called King Christian, the seventh

00:36:27.000 --> 00:36:29.000
 of Denmark, when she was 15.

00:36:29.000 --> 00:36:32.000
 And he was also quite mad.

00:36:32.000 --> 00:36:34.000
 And he hung her, he didn't like her at all.

00:36:34.000 --> 00:36:36.000
 The fifth, his 15-year-old sister.

00:36:36.000 --> 00:36:40.000
 So he hung her portrait in his lavatory as a show of how he didn't like his wife.

00:36:40.000 --> 00:36:41.000
 So his wife?

00:36:41.000 --> 00:36:42.000
 Yeah.

00:36:42.000 --> 00:36:44.000
 He hung his wife's portrait in the toilet.

00:36:44.000 --> 00:36:46.000
 And he was an obsessive masturbator.

00:36:46.000 --> 00:36:47.000
 He was very famous.

00:36:47.000 --> 00:36:48.000
 Did he do it in the toilet?

00:36:48.000 --> 00:36:50.000
 Is that why the portrait was there?

00:36:50.000 --> 00:36:52.000
 I think the toilet was the only one we didn't do it.

00:36:52.000 --> 00:36:53.000
 Really?

00:36:53.000 --> 00:36:57.000
 Yeah, he went to see doctors about this and doctors were always trying to stop him doing it.

00:36:57.000 --> 00:37:01.000
 But he once entered a feast with his trousers, round his ankles.

00:37:01.000 --> 00:37:06.000
 And he had servants, manical him and then beat him with rolls of paper.

00:37:06.000 --> 00:37:11.000
 And he visited England once and he visited all the brothels in London and then completely

00:37:11.000 --> 00:37:14.000
 trashed St. James's palace.

00:37:14.000 --> 00:37:16.000
 And so that was the man that his sister married.

00:37:16.000 --> 00:37:17.000
 Oh, okay.

00:37:17.000 --> 00:37:21.000
 St. George III thought, well, marriage doesn't go well for her.

00:37:21.000 --> 00:37:24.000
 Let's protect women for the excessive masturbation.

00:37:24.000 --> 00:37:29.000
 So he saw a doctor, I'd love to hear the doctor transcript read that.

00:37:29.000 --> 00:37:32.000
 So the way to stop doing this is, okay, you're masturbating.

00:37:32.000 --> 00:37:33.000
 You're masturbating.

00:37:33.000 --> 00:37:35.000
 Yeah, just put it back away.

00:37:35.000 --> 00:37:37.000
 Okay, so yeah, so we have lots of medicines.

00:37:37.000 --> 00:37:39.000
 Okay, you're masturbating again.

00:37:39.000 --> 00:37:41.000
 We're just going to have to put that away again.

00:37:41.000 --> 00:37:43.000
 Okay, you're doing very good.

00:37:43.000 --> 00:37:46.000
 It's very difficult to stop.

00:37:46.000 --> 00:37:48.000
 You know, you've got to be some person to stop.

00:37:48.000 --> 00:37:51.000
 Hey, you don't need to tell me.

00:37:51.000 --> 00:37:53.000
 So, Queen Charlotte, we were talking about.

00:37:53.000 --> 00:37:54.000
 Yeah.

00:37:54.000 --> 00:37:59.000
 She had a pet zebra who was presented to her by the governor of the Cape in South Africa.

00:37:59.000 --> 00:38:03.000
 And it was known colloquially as the Queen's Ass.

00:38:03.000 --> 00:38:07.000
 And there was a massive scandal when the Queen's Guard were caught charging people

00:38:07.000 --> 00:38:10.000
 to expose the Queen's ass to public view.

00:38:10.000 --> 00:38:15.000
 In 1764, and you guys are really holding this thing very nicely.

00:38:15.000 --> 00:38:19.000
 The newspaper's printed a story that the guards were charging people to see this.

00:38:19.000 --> 00:38:24.000
 And then Queen Charlotte later bred this zebra by getting a male donkey

00:38:24.000 --> 00:38:27.000
 and painting the back of it white and black stripes

00:38:27.000 --> 00:38:29.000
 so that it thought that it was a zebra's...

00:38:29.000 --> 00:38:31.000
 Wow, that cast.

00:38:31.000 --> 00:38:32.000
 ...ass, yeah, exactly.

00:38:32.000 --> 00:38:33.000
 And it worked.

00:38:33.000 --> 00:38:35.000
 Wow, I'm going to try that with my own bottom.

00:38:35.000 --> 00:38:38.000
 I'm going to take my own bottom black and white and see if I can get a zebra to fuck me.

00:38:38.000 --> 00:38:40.000
 It's what I'm going to do.

00:38:40.000 --> 00:38:42.000
 I've always been quite obsessed with having sex with a nacapie,

00:38:42.000 --> 00:38:46.000
 which is like a sort of larmory zebra or a kind of thing.

00:38:46.000 --> 00:38:48.000
 But from behind, it's got a very nice...

00:38:48.000 --> 00:38:49.000
 It looks like a sort of...

00:38:49.000 --> 00:38:50.000
 You've always been...

00:38:50.000 --> 00:38:51.000
 No, I've just...

00:38:51.000 --> 00:38:52.000
 And they've got...

00:38:52.000 --> 00:38:54.000
 I've been obsessed with a nacapie before.

00:38:54.000 --> 00:38:56.000
 I've been to see a nacapie quite a few times in La Junseau.

00:38:56.000 --> 00:38:58.000
 From behind, it's like...

00:38:58.000 --> 00:39:00.000
 It's got a very leopard-skin trouser...

00:39:00.000 --> 00:39:01.000
 Right.

00:39:01.000 --> 00:39:03.000
 You know, so it looks like a lady's hind core.

00:39:03.000 --> 00:39:04.000
 So that's nice.

00:39:04.000 --> 00:39:06.000
 Well, the cup's got a very long tongue.

00:39:06.000 --> 00:39:08.000
 So you could be there and then they can't...

00:39:08.000 --> 00:39:10.000
 If a hat dives up to an animal.

00:39:10.000 --> 00:39:11.000
 That's it.

00:39:11.000 --> 00:39:14.000
 I don't think this sounds like if I had to situation.

00:39:14.000 --> 00:39:16.000
 I think there's too much thought that's gone into this.

00:39:16.000 --> 00:39:19.000
 If I hadn't had sex with me, I would paint my bottom black and white.

00:39:19.000 --> 00:39:21.000
 It's just the one I wouldn't mind.

00:39:21.000 --> 00:39:23.000
 Yes, it's fair, Andy.

00:39:23.000 --> 00:39:26.000
 We've all got one.

00:39:26.000 --> 00:39:28.000
 Does he let you in London zoo?

00:39:28.000 --> 00:39:29.000
 They do.

00:39:29.000 --> 00:39:32.000
 I'm a member of London zoo.

00:39:32.000 --> 00:39:34.000
 I can go anytime I want.

00:39:34.000 --> 00:39:36.000
 It's a new meaning to the word "member of London zoo".

00:39:36.000 --> 00:39:38.000
 Wow.

00:39:38.000 --> 00:39:40.000
 What is going on?

00:39:40.000 --> 00:39:41.000
 Oh, you don't know enough.

00:39:41.000 --> 00:39:43.000
 They let you masturbate quickly.

00:39:43.000 --> 00:39:46.000
 What are you donating?

00:39:46.000 --> 00:39:50.000
 They're hoping that I'm creating a new hybrid creature that they can put in.

00:39:50.000 --> 00:39:52.000
 Imagine if it was successful.

00:39:52.000 --> 00:39:53.000
 Oh, God.

00:39:53.000 --> 00:39:55.000
 The herring zebra.

00:39:55.000 --> 00:39:57.000
 The herring ocapie.

00:39:59.000 --> 00:40:02.000
 I have taken the tone down.

00:40:02.000 --> 00:40:03.000
 No, no, no.

00:40:03.000 --> 00:40:12.000
 Let's bring the tone back up.

00:40:12.000 --> 00:40:15.000
 It is time for our final fact of the show, and that is James.

00:40:15.000 --> 00:40:22.000
 My fact this week is that female hyenas say hello by licking each other's clitoruses.

00:40:22.000 --> 00:40:24.000
 Crunky.

00:40:24.000 --> 00:40:27.000
 An uncompromisingly direct greeting, I would say.

00:40:27.000 --> 00:40:32.000
 I just now feel like we're giving Richard ideas for his next trip to the zoo.

00:40:32.000 --> 00:40:34.000
 I'm just saying quite a bit.

00:40:34.000 --> 00:40:36.000
 Very nicely.

00:40:36.000 --> 00:40:41.000
 Is that why the male hyenas are always laughing just out of sort of awkwardness and excitement?

00:40:41.000 --> 00:40:50.000
 Okay, so this fact was sent to me by text.

00:40:50.000 --> 00:40:52.000
 But not honestly.

00:40:52.000 --> 00:40:57.000
 By the saw herring.

00:40:57.000 --> 00:41:03.000
 When we're on top, there was no name attached, but phone number ends with 067, so you know who you are.

00:41:03.000 --> 00:41:06.000
 Yeah, that's nearly my number.

00:41:06.000 --> 00:41:13.000
 I confirmed it in a book called Wild Sex, The Science Behind Mating in the Animal Kingdom by Karen Bonda.

00:41:13.000 --> 00:41:15.000
 And yet, it seems that it does happen.

00:41:15.000 --> 00:41:21.000
 So when females arrive and see each other, they stand in a parallel position facing opposite directions,

00:41:21.000 --> 00:41:27.000
 lift the hind legs, display the fully erect clitoruses to each other, and then they smell and lick them.

00:41:27.000 --> 00:41:31.000
 And this is because female hyenas have extremely large clitoruses.

00:41:31.000 --> 00:41:34.000
 Do they ever smell them and not lick them?

00:41:34.000 --> 00:41:36.000
 They smell them.

00:41:36.000 --> 00:41:37.000
 No.

00:41:37.000 --> 00:41:39.000
 Sorry.

00:41:39.000 --> 00:41:42.000
 That's not as very awkward in the hyena world.

00:41:42.000 --> 00:41:48.000
 It's like, you know, when you give someone a high five and they don't give you a high five back, it's exactly like that.

00:41:48.000 --> 00:41:50.000
 Wow.

00:41:50.000 --> 00:41:51.000
 Yeah.

00:41:51.000 --> 00:41:59.000
 So, and this happens between females of different ranks, and depending on who licks first, depends on who is the most highest ranking.

00:41:59.000 --> 00:42:01.000
 And they have, they're like seven inches long, aren't they?

00:42:01.000 --> 00:42:03.000
 About seven inches long with clitoruses.

00:42:03.000 --> 00:42:04.000
 Yeah.

00:42:04.000 --> 00:42:08.000
 They're essentially a penis in appearance, and they get erections.

00:42:08.000 --> 00:42:11.000
 So when they're copulating, they get erections.

00:42:11.000 --> 00:42:14.000
 And they also have a labia that's fused to like testes.

00:42:14.000 --> 00:42:18.000
 It actually does seem a bit like, because they've all just got the genders the wrong way around.

00:42:18.000 --> 00:42:20.000
 Except that they give birth through them.

00:42:20.000 --> 00:42:23.000
 And then they give birth through them, and so that clarifies things.

00:42:23.000 --> 00:42:24.000
 Yes.

00:42:24.000 --> 00:42:25.000
 And it's a horrific birth.

00:42:25.000 --> 00:42:26.000
 Yeah.

00:42:26.000 --> 00:42:27.000
 Yeah.

00:42:27.000 --> 00:42:36.000
 I think it's the only animal birth that's worse than humans, because humans are not very well adapted to give birth, because we've got our hits of two narrow and our heads are too big, essentially.

00:42:36.000 --> 00:42:43.000
 And so our birth is much, much more traumatic than almost any other animal, but hyenas, it is worse, because you aren't giving birth through a penis.

00:42:43.000 --> 00:42:44.000
 Yes.

00:42:44.000 --> 00:42:47.000
 There's two types of erections, which are very useful to know.

00:42:47.000 --> 00:42:50.000
 There's a social erection and a sexual erection.

00:42:50.000 --> 00:42:51.000
 No.

00:42:51.000 --> 00:42:54.000
 What I've got here, this is a social erection.

00:42:54.000 --> 00:42:58.000
 And now I've got, now I know about that, that's a good thing to know.

00:42:58.000 --> 00:43:02.000
 Unless anyone fans is having sex in which case, it can just turn very quickly into a sexual erection.

00:43:02.000 --> 00:43:05.000
 Well, but where does it turn if you're interested?

00:43:05.000 --> 00:43:07.000
 Ah, if you're interested, it's suddenly as a sexual erection.

00:43:07.000 --> 00:43:09.000
 In my case, I don't know if that's the case.

00:43:09.000 --> 00:43:13.000
 It turns just as you walk past the large ungulate section of the zoo.

00:43:13.000 --> 00:43:20.000
 It's very difficult for the males, the true males, to mate as well.

00:43:20.000 --> 00:43:26.000
 So they have to practice a lot, because being able to get your genuine penis into this long clitoris is a tough gig.

00:43:26.000 --> 00:43:28.000
 It's like dots.

00:43:28.000 --> 00:43:34.000
 And so it takes about two months practice from male hyenas before you are able to penetrate properly.

00:43:34.000 --> 00:43:39.000
 Yeah, and they're probably crouching behind them and trying to point the penis the right way.

00:43:39.000 --> 00:43:40.000
 Two months of...

00:43:40.000 --> 00:43:46.000
 Yeah, you say that, but George III's brother-in-law was practicing for a lot longer than that.

00:43:46.000 --> 00:43:50.000
 But 60% of hyena cubs suffocate on the way out.

00:43:50.000 --> 00:43:52.000
 No, yeah, it's so sad.

00:43:52.000 --> 00:43:54.000
 Yeah, more than half, because you're in this long chute.

00:43:54.000 --> 00:43:56.000
 Holy moly, it's crazy.

00:43:56.000 --> 00:44:01.000
 There's all sorts of hyena mythologian, because of the fact they're so weird.

00:44:01.000 --> 00:44:07.000
 And just beliefs about them, so plenty of the elder, friend of the show.

00:44:07.000 --> 00:44:09.000
 He said that...

00:44:09.000 --> 00:44:11.000
 Keep writing it.

00:44:11.000 --> 00:44:16.000
 He said that hyenas are capable of calling people by name, because they're quite weird.

00:44:16.000 --> 00:44:20.000
 They sound slightly humed in the way they're off, calling people by name, and then killing you when you go outside.

00:44:20.000 --> 00:44:21.000
 So they lure you out.

00:44:21.000 --> 00:44:23.000
 You think someone's calling you.

00:44:23.000 --> 00:44:29.000
 Pliny, pliny, pliny, pliny, the elder, pliny, the elder.

00:44:29.000 --> 00:44:32.000
 Get that hyena out of here.

00:44:32.000 --> 00:44:38.000
 There's also in mythology. Have you heard of werewolves? There's werehyenas.

00:44:38.000 --> 00:44:40.000
 Which is very exciting, but they have a different thing.

00:44:40.000 --> 00:44:44.000
 So your classic werewolf will obviously be your wolf.

00:44:44.000 --> 00:44:46.000
 I'm sorry, a human that turns into a wolf.

00:44:46.000 --> 00:44:50.000
 With the werehyena, it's often a hyena that turns into a human.

00:44:50.000 --> 00:44:54.000
 So at night time, on a full moon, you might be talking to a human.

00:44:54.000 --> 00:44:58.000
 And they will not be socialised at all.

00:44:58.000 --> 00:45:02.000
 Because they spend five, six third time as hyenas.

00:45:02.000 --> 00:45:04.000
 Yeah. And their penis might be a clitoris.

00:45:04.000 --> 00:45:06.000
 That is true.

00:45:06.000 --> 00:45:10.000
 They're greetings. You can tell you've met one immediately.

00:45:10.000 --> 00:45:12.000
 As soon as they walk into a party, you know it's them.

00:45:12.000 --> 00:45:18.000
 They must be disappointed in how hard it's to find the human clitoris though.

00:45:18.000 --> 00:45:20.000
 What's going on?

00:45:20.000 --> 00:45:22.000
 It's not even here.

00:45:24.000 --> 00:45:28.000
 Oh, I guess a lot of sympathy from fellow men at the party at that point.

00:45:28.000 --> 00:45:32.000
 I know, right?

00:45:32.000 --> 00:45:38.000
 Walter Rally thought that hyenas were so disgusting that Noah refused to let them on the arc.

00:45:38.000 --> 00:45:44.000
 And the species was only resurrected after a natural copulation between a dog and a cat.

00:45:44.000 --> 00:45:46.000
 Okay.

00:45:46.000 --> 00:45:52.000
 It's not as terrifying as the Richard Herring, London Zoo or Captain Treacher.

00:45:52.000 --> 00:45:54.000
 I've got some clitoris fat.

00:45:54.000 --> 00:45:56.000
 Yes please.

00:45:56.000 --> 00:46:00.000
 The clitoris is the only part of the human body that never ages.

00:46:00.000 --> 00:46:04.000
 20 year old clitoris and eight year old clitoris are identical.

00:46:04.000 --> 00:46:06.000
 So you can't count the rings.

00:46:06.000 --> 00:46:10.000
 They get slightly bigger sometimes throughout life, but then they don't look.

00:46:10.000 --> 00:46:12.000
 They don't wrinkle, I guess.

00:46:12.000 --> 00:46:14.000
 That is a really good idea.

00:46:14.000 --> 00:46:16.000
 That's extraordinary.

00:46:16.000 --> 00:46:20.000
 And also, I was surprised, the word clitoris only dates for that.

00:46:20.000 --> 00:46:26.000
 And then the word clit was only came up in America in the 1950s.

00:46:26.000 --> 00:46:30.000
 So it took 200 years, 300 years, some of the short and clitoris.

00:46:30.000 --> 00:46:32.000
 There were saying clitoris for a long time for some of those.

00:46:32.000 --> 00:46:34.000
 This is a mouthful.

00:46:34.000 --> 00:46:36.000
 Do we know if it had a meaning before?

00:46:36.000 --> 00:46:40.000
 I think it is a Latin word.

00:46:40.000 --> 00:46:44.000
 I think it means hood.

00:46:44.000 --> 00:46:48.000
 I would have had a different meaning.

00:46:48.000 --> 00:46:50.000
 I would go around with a...

00:46:50.000 --> 00:46:52.000
 With a clitoris, I would say.

00:46:52.000 --> 00:46:54.000
 I don't know what the Romans called a clitoris.

00:46:54.000 --> 00:46:56.000
 If they didn't call it a clitoris.

00:46:56.000 --> 00:47:00.000
 One would have always related to the fact that women weren't thought to be...

00:47:00.000 --> 00:47:02.000
 They weren't thought to have any organs that would experience that.

00:47:02.000 --> 00:47:04.000
 They weren't thought to have organs.

00:47:04.000 --> 00:47:06.000
 They weren't thought to have organs.

00:47:06.000 --> 00:47:08.000
 They could experience sexual pleasure or anything.

00:47:08.000 --> 00:47:10.000
 But actually, that's often a myth.

00:47:10.000 --> 00:47:12.000
 I think they often did.

00:47:12.000 --> 00:47:16.000
 I think in ancient Greek, in ancient Greece, women often talked about the pleasure you get from sex.

00:47:16.000 --> 00:47:18.000
 There must have been a concept of a clitoris.

00:47:18.000 --> 00:47:20.000
 What was it called, Greek?

00:47:20.000 --> 00:47:22.000
 Any Greeks listening?

00:47:22.000 --> 00:47:24.000
 Plenty of you could ask for a name.

00:47:24.000 --> 00:47:26.000
 Was it called a wipple tickle or something?

00:47:26.000 --> 00:47:28.000
 We always get that fact set.

00:47:28.000 --> 00:47:30.000
 That was supposedly what the G-spot was going to be called.

00:47:30.000 --> 00:47:32.000
 It was doctor something.

00:47:32.000 --> 00:47:34.000
 Was it Beverly Wipple?

00:47:34.000 --> 00:47:36.000
 No, it was a doctor.

00:47:36.000 --> 00:47:38.000
 His name started with G.

00:47:38.000 --> 00:47:40.000
 The reason the G-spot is called the G-spot is because it's named after a doctor...

00:47:40.000 --> 00:47:42.000
 It's something like Geistner.

00:47:42.000 --> 00:47:44.000
 Geistner starts with G.

00:47:44.000 --> 00:47:46.000
 Should we call it the Gavin?

00:47:46.000 --> 00:47:48.000
 No, no, no, no.

00:47:48.000 --> 00:47:50.000
 If I discovered that I wanted to have my whole name, wouldn't it be called the R-spot?

00:47:50.000 --> 00:47:52.000
 I wanted to be the Richie Spot as well as one of mine.

00:47:52.000 --> 00:47:54.000
 No, the R-spot.

00:47:54.000 --> 00:47:58.000
 The Gavin.

00:47:58.000 --> 00:48:02.000
 It would stop serving its purpose immediately if you call it the Gavin.

00:48:02.000 --> 00:48:08.000
 Okay, that is it.

00:48:08.000 --> 00:48:10.000
 That is all our facts.

00:48:10.000 --> 00:48:12.000
