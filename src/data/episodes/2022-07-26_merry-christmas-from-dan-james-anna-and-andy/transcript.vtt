00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.920
 Merry Christmas, everyone. Welcome to this week's episode of Fish. Hang on a second. It's not Friday. What's this doing here?

00:00:05.920 --> 00:00:11.000
 It's a bonus episode. That's right. You've been good and Santa's brought you an audio present.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:18.400
 An extra goodie that you weren't expecting. What you're about to hear is the first letter of our audio book of the year 2018.

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:23.800
 We sat in a studio. We read out our book. It lasts about nine hours long. It's all of us interjecting on each other.

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:26.240
 We really love it. And we thought, as is Christmas day...

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:31.080
 Can you not interject on each other? Just as we've done.

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:33.080
 That's right. Okay.

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:42.240
 So, yeah, we were in the studio. It was a long, long, hard session of us constantly interjecting all over each other.

00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:47.720
 Shall we just say, "On with the show?"

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:51.920
 It's the letter A, and they're by the rest of it. Okay, on with the show.

00:00:51.920 --> 00:01:01.400
 A, in which we learn why flies can't fly with American Airlines, whose reputation might be tarnished by working with the White House,

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:07.000
 who bought Russell Crowe's Jockstrap, how to tell your astronauts from your astronauts,

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:12.440
 and why the Belgian army are such mummies, boys. A, A.

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:17.600
 Okay, we're starting the book with A, a good place to start. No ad vaque news this year. That's tragic.

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:23.600
 But we found quite a lot of A, A news, didn't we? Too much, I would say.

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:31.520
 Okay, here's one. American Airlines, which is an AA, they banned passengers from traveling with emotional support insects.

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:33.840
 Did that affect many people?

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:36.400
 No, probably not even that many insects either, right?

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:40.160
 Yeah, I don't know how emotionally supportive insects can be.

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:43.920
 So, American Airlines, they changed their rules on emotional support animals this year,

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:49.040
 and that means their insects now prohibited, along with any animals with hooves,

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:54.400
 any emotional support amphibians, emotional support ferrets, emotional support hedgehogs,

00:01:54.400 --> 00:02:02.880
 and the move was a response to an 84% rise in urine, feces, and aggression-related incidents involving animals since 2016.

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:07.680
 Well, American, I need to ban me if that's the problem.

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:11.600
 We found more AA news as well, but we found AA news about the alcoholics anonymous.

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:15.920
 Oh, yeah. So, there was a man who bought the original alcoholics anonymous document

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:20.560
 and he did so, and then he waived his anonymity in order to help alcoholics.

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:22.800
 Wow, so he's no longer anonymous.

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:27.360
 He's not. So, there's this founding book of alcoholics anonymous, which is from 1935,

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:32.400
 and this year it was sold at Northland in Los Angeles for $2.4 million,

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:36.880
 and it gets called the Big Book, because it's very big, because it's paper is very thick.

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:42.800
 And the man who bought it was the man who owns the Indianapolis Colts, American football team,

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:46.560
 and he's been battling his own addictions over the last two years. He's called Jim Urce,

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:50.400
 and he decided to go public, and he said that he would make a cabinet for the book

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:55.040
 and display it for part of the year at Alcoholics Anonymous's Headquarters in New York in order to

00:02:55.040 --> 00:03:00.320
 help inspire alcoholics to give up drink. Oh, that's a nice story. That's very cool.

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:07.200
 Another AA, the first AA that springs to mind, really, is the AA battery, right? And this year,

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:13.920
 scientists invented a battery that never runs out ever. So, it's AA size. It was created by Osio,

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:19.520
 a wireless technology company that's based in Washington state, and it's called Forever Battery.

00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:24.480
 It comes with a transmitter that constantly keeps it fully charged by a Wi-Fi-like waves.

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:29.040
 So, just in the air. The air charges it. You are an expert in this kind of technology,

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:34.240
 I practically invented it. Although it has to be that the battery and the transmitter

00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:37.520
 are within 10 meters of each other. It's a small caveat. It's in a small print.

00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:43.040
 Hope is it that one day these kind of setups will be available in every single home.

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:48.800
 Oh, wow. There's one final AA, which is that the automobile association found that there was one

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:54.080
 breakdown they couldn't fix. A former executive chairman at the automobile association

00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:58.160
 sued the company for wrongful dismissal after he was fired for gross misconduct.

00:03:58.800 --> 00:04:02.160
 He said he was stressed and overworked when he got into a fight with a colleague and that the

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:07.600
 company had no regard for his mental well-being. So, essentially, his argument appears to be that the AA

00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:11.920
 couldn't deal with his breakdown. Are they using that on their advertising in future?

00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:16.160
 There's only one breakdown the AA can't fix. And it's your emotional breakdown.

00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:22.480
 Advertising. Roger Federer lost the rights to his own initials.

00:04:22.480 --> 00:04:28.000
 So, this is the RF logo, which if you've ever watched a tennis game in the last

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:32.640
 15 years, you'll know he has sort of sewn embroidered into his shirt in kind of gold.

00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:38.800
 And it's owned by Nike. And they've been his sponsor for 24 years, but this year he switched

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:44.960
 allegiance to the Japanese company Uniqlo. However, the initials are still owned by Nike.

00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:49.680
 And so, he now has to reach an agreement with Nike to get them back because, as he put it,

00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:54.880
 they are my initials, they are mine, which is almost fair enough. But he can draw comfort,

00:04:54.880 --> 00:05:01.040
 Roger Federer, from the fact that Uniqlo is paying him $300 million just to wear their clothes

00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:06.320
 on court over the next 10 years. Well, Uniqlo and most other advertisers are hoping to maximize

00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:10.800
 their public exposure in ways like this. The company that makes Skittles produce an advert this

00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:16.800
 year that will only ever be seen by one person. That's teenager and Skittles fan Marcos Menendez,

00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:22.160
 who, as a publicity stunt, was shut in a room and shown an advert that was made specially for him,

00:05:22.160 --> 00:05:27.200
 while his reaction was streamed live on Facebook to thousands of viewers. He revealed after

00:05:27.200 --> 00:05:32.240
 was what was in the advert that only he saw apparently it featured friend star David Schwimmer shooting

00:05:32.240 --> 00:05:38.400
 lasers from his mouth at Marcos' mother and turning her into Skittles. Cool. So it seems pretty great.

00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:42.960
 Another company that was probably a bit less happy with the way it's goods were being advertised

00:05:42.960 --> 00:05:48.080
 was Team Manufacturer Twinnings. So Twinnings complained to the advertising standards authority

00:05:48.080 --> 00:05:53.920
 after Poundland decided to publish a tweet. This was last Christmas and the tweet showed a naughty

00:05:53.920 --> 00:06:00.480
 elf squatting over a female doll and holding a Twinnings team bag above her face. That is naughty.

00:06:00.480 --> 00:06:05.120
 Yeah, the accompanying caption on the tweet read, "How do you take your tea one lump or two?"

00:06:05.120 --> 00:06:11.280
 So yeah, the advertising standards authority ruled the ad was irresponsible. But hilarious.

00:06:12.480 --> 00:06:18.160
 Meanwhile, the truth of that old advertising mantra that sex sells was demonstrated in the monkey world

00:06:18.160 --> 00:06:24.080
 this year. So a group of male macaques was shown pictures of either dominant male macaque faces or

00:06:24.080 --> 00:06:32.320
 subordinate male faces or female macaque hindquarters bottoms alongside logos of brands like Pizza Hut

00:06:32.320 --> 00:06:37.520
 and Adidas and the macaque showed a very clear preference for the logos they associated with the

00:06:37.520 --> 00:06:42.800
 hindquarters. You wrote the article didn't you? I did, yes. You chose to use hindquarters. That's what I

00:06:42.800 --> 00:06:49.520
 call them. I was just dumbing it down for the masses. Advice. The government advised people being

00:06:49.520 --> 00:06:55.600
 deported to Jamaica to put on a Jamaican accent. Labour MP David Lamy drew attention this year to

00:06:55.600 --> 00:06:59.760
 a leaflet given to British residents being deported to Jamaica, published when Theresa May was

00:06:59.760 --> 00:07:06.080
 home secretary. As he pointed out, it included such tips as "try to be Jamaican, use local accents

00:07:06.080 --> 00:07:11.040
 and dialect." And the pamphlets existence came to light during the Windrush scandal when it was

00:07:11.040 --> 00:07:16.560
 revealed that hundreds of British subjects who had arrived in the UK between 1948 and 1970

00:07:16.560 --> 00:07:22.880
 had been wrongly detained, denied legal rights, lost homes, jobs and benefits, and in at least 63

00:07:22.880 --> 00:07:27.440
 cases have been deported even though they had originally been given an automatic right to remain

00:07:27.440 --> 00:07:32.480
 permanently in the UK. And to make matters worse, the government had destroyed all their landing

00:07:32.480 --> 00:07:38.160
 cards back in 2010 to cut back on stored paperwork, so the Windrush generation had no way of proving

00:07:38.160 --> 00:07:43.600
 their status. That was some bad advice. More bad advice was in preparation for the World Cup,

00:07:43.600 --> 00:07:47.760
 where Argentina's Football Association issued a manual to its players and officials

00:07:47.760 --> 00:07:52.480
 that contained a chapter on how to pick up women while they were in Russia. Tips included,

00:07:52.480 --> 00:07:56.640
 make sure your clean, smell good and dress well. Is that bad advice? That's great advice.

00:07:57.280 --> 00:08:03.440
 Bad to give the advice. That's right. And Russian girls hate boring men, never ask trite questions.

00:08:03.440 --> 00:08:08.960
 Be original. They don't like to be seen as objects. Can I just say, I'm married to a Russian girl,

00:08:08.960 --> 00:08:14.160
 and if they don't like boring men, then I'm in serious trouble. So after that leave,

00:08:14.160 --> 00:08:18.240
 that was given out. The Argentine Football Association insisted that it had been mistakenly included,

00:08:18.240 --> 00:08:22.400
 and when it was noticed, they had the booklets returned and they hurriedly ripped out the offending

00:08:22.400 --> 00:08:29.120
 pages. Alexa. Alexa got in trouble for laughing at her owners.

00:08:29.120 --> 00:08:34.720
 Numerous customers this year reported that Amazon's voice-activated assistant was breaking out into

00:08:34.720 --> 00:08:39.840
 spontaneous laughter when she wasn't even supposed to be switched on. Amazon fixed the glitch,

00:08:39.840 --> 00:08:44.480
 explaining it was caused by echo devices mistakenly misinterpreting words it overheard,

00:08:44.480 --> 00:08:50.720
 as the phrase Alexa laugh. Amazon was not able to explain why one device started telling random

00:08:50.720 --> 00:08:55.360
 jokes without being asked, and why another woke up its owner around midnight and announced

00:08:55.360 --> 00:09:00.880
 he's home. He's home for no apparent reason. In some cases, Alexa even went so far as to place

00:09:00.880 --> 00:09:06.720
 orders for unwanted products. So one woman tried to have an Alexa TV advert banned, claiming that her

00:09:06.720 --> 00:09:11.200
 echo dot had ordered pet food, because it overheard someone on the ad asking for it.

00:09:11.200 --> 00:09:17.440
 And White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders tweeted that her two-year-old son had inadvertently

00:09:17.440 --> 00:09:24.000
 ordered a Batman toy by shouting Batman repeatedly into their device. Perhaps even more unnervingly,

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:28.800
 one couple discovered Alexa had recorded their private conversation and sent it to one of their

00:09:28.800 --> 00:09:33.760
 contacts. They only realized this when he phoned to inform them he just received a recording of

00:09:33.760 --> 00:09:42.320
 them discussing hardwood floors. Given all of this, customers might not be reassured by the news

00:09:42.320 --> 00:09:47.360
 that Amazon has filed a patent for voice sniffing technology, which would theoretically let its

00:09:47.360 --> 00:09:53.440
 echo speakers listen to people all the time to ascertain their likes and dislikes. It's no wonder

00:09:53.440 --> 00:10:00.000
 perhaps that the name Alexa has declined in popularity by 33% in the US since 2015.

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:04.720
 I like as well the Church of England launched an app this year that allows you to ask Alexa questions

00:10:04.720 --> 00:10:09.440
 like "Where's my nearest church?" or "Please read me the Lord's Prayer. What is the Bible?"

00:10:10.800 --> 00:10:14.720
 Not doing well as a "How can a benevolent and omnipotent God allow evil?"

00:10:14.720 --> 00:10:26.400
 An all-you-can-eat restaurant had to shut after two weeks because customers ate all they could.

00:10:26.400 --> 00:10:32.960
 Jiaminer, a restaurant in Chengdu, China, shut its doors for good after launching an all-you-can-eat

00:10:32.960 --> 00:10:39.840
 membership card, which, for 120 yuan, which is about 13 pounds, guaranteed unlimited food for a month.

00:10:40.560 --> 00:10:45.040
 The owners said that they were aware they might lose some money initially, but hope that their loyalty

00:10:45.040 --> 00:10:49.440
 scheme would not only attract clients, but would allow them to negotiate discounts from food and

00:10:49.440 --> 00:10:54.560
 drink suppliers. What they didn't count on was how many customers would take advantage of that deal.

00:10:54.560 --> 00:10:59.680
 In the first 14 days, the restaurant attracted more than 7,000 diners, many of whom were repeat

00:10:59.680 --> 00:11:04.240
 customers or people who had borrowed cards from family and friends. After just two weeks,

00:11:04.240 --> 00:11:09.040
 the restaurant had fallen into debt to the tune of 50,000 pounds and was forced to shut.

00:11:09.600 --> 00:11:12.720
 The owners cited their poor management as the problem.

00:11:12.720 --> 00:11:13.680
 Sounds about right.

00:11:13.680 --> 00:11:19.120
 They also had problem at Brighton's Big Cheese Festival this year. Did you see that?

00:11:19.120 --> 00:11:24.080
 They ran out of cheese. They said it was due to the bad weather which meant that the traders couldn't

00:11:24.080 --> 00:11:28.720
 get there, but one person wrote in social media, "Hmm, what's expecting more cheese?"

00:11:28.720 --> 00:11:34.160
 Someone else said, "I'd rather have gone to the supermarket. Less queues, more cheese."

00:11:36.800 --> 00:11:40.640
 And a couple of months after that, I think, didn't an all-you-can-eat pizza festival

00:11:40.640 --> 00:11:42.160
 not in Hill run out of pizza?

00:11:42.160 --> 00:11:45.760
 It was just to go to an all-you-can-eat pizza festival. Who can eat more than one pizza?

00:11:45.760 --> 00:11:50.640
 Well, two people on this table, good. We're not going to specify which.

00:11:50.640 --> 00:11:53.760
 Who can manage more than half a small pizza?

00:11:53.760 --> 00:11:58.320
 Animal races.

00:11:58.320 --> 00:12:03.840
 A snail racing competition was postponed because the snails were too sluggish.

00:12:04.400 --> 00:12:08.080
 Now that's their words, not my words. That's not me trying to make a terrible joke.

00:12:08.080 --> 00:12:09.280
 That's the snail's words.

00:12:09.280 --> 00:12:15.120
 Say a apologise afterwards, having two sluggish words. Sorry, guys. Post-race interview.

00:12:15.120 --> 00:12:21.760
 So this was a race that was due to take place in February at the Dartmoor Union pub in Plymouth.

00:12:21.760 --> 00:12:25.840
 But the organizers went to the pet shop to collect the snails and they were told that the cold weather

00:12:25.840 --> 00:12:30.720
 had made them extra sleepy. This pub probably should have taken some advice from the organizers

00:12:30.720 --> 00:12:35.600
 of the World Snail Racing Championships, which always takes place in July in Norfolk.

00:12:35.600 --> 00:12:38.960
 Now they use a special damp cloth to keep their snails happy.

00:12:38.960 --> 00:12:43.200
 The human competitors in that one, though, they don't always show the same compassion.

00:12:43.200 --> 00:12:46.160
 The owner of the winner this year, Joe Waterfield, said,

00:12:46.160 --> 00:12:50.240
 "I pulled him out this morning and told him if he didn't win, I would squash him."

00:12:50.240 --> 00:12:56.400
 Also, what a fix that the World Snail Racing Championships always takes place in Norfolk.

00:12:56.400 --> 00:12:58.240
 FIFA could learn a thing or two from these guys.

00:12:58.240 --> 00:13:00.960
 I think the next one isn't Qatar, actually.

00:13:00.960 --> 00:13:07.840
 So the animal race with the youngest participants this year was definitely the great "high-high".

00:13:07.840 --> 00:13:17.040
 The great "he-he" sperm race set up by a New Zealand charity to raise money for the "he-he" bird,

00:13:17.040 --> 00:13:20.080
 which is an endangered yet relatively unknown species.

00:13:20.080 --> 00:13:23.920
 sperm samples were taken from four different "he-he" colonies,

00:13:23.920 --> 00:13:28.480
 and people were encouraged to place a ten dollar, that's ten New Zealand dollar bet,

00:13:28.480 --> 00:13:30.720
 on which of the samples would swim the fastest.

00:13:30.720 --> 00:13:37.120
 According to the website, the male with the fastest sperm was CP11870,

00:13:37.120 --> 00:13:39.520
 from Tiritiri, Matangi Island.

00:13:39.520 --> 00:13:44.400
 Also known as a male who was famous for his natty pink leg bands,

00:13:44.400 --> 00:13:46.320
 but secure in his masculinity.

00:13:46.320 --> 00:13:49.200
 Sorry, the sperm had pink leg bands.

00:13:49.200 --> 00:13:53.600
 No, so it was the "he-he" bird who had the fast sperm.

00:13:54.240 --> 00:13:57.200
 Who also had leg bands who was also secure in his masculinity.

00:13:57.200 --> 00:14:00.080
 So was the sperm with the name...

00:14:00.080 --> 00:14:04.320
 I don't know what his legs were like, but is that his name, or is that the "he-he" bird's name?

00:14:04.320 --> 00:14:07.680
 CP118 is called CP11870.

00:14:07.680 --> 00:14:10.480
 Not the sperm, because then they would have to name every sperm,

00:14:10.480 --> 00:14:12.880
 and that's even just announcing the race.

00:14:12.880 --> 00:14:14.480
 You get the racers what they get.

00:14:14.480 --> 00:14:15.680
 You get very long-term books.

00:14:15.680 --> 00:14:17.280
 I don't think you get sperm-name books.

00:14:19.440 --> 00:14:26.800
 Antarctic. Every minute the Antarctic loses enough ice to keep the UK in slushies for an entire year.

00:14:26.800 --> 00:14:30.240
 In fact, in the time it took me to read that sentence,

00:14:30.240 --> 00:14:33.920
 Antarctica lost 12 Olympic swimming pools worth of ice,

00:14:33.920 --> 00:14:38.880
 with more than a gigaton, that's a billion tons of ice disappearing every two days.

00:14:38.880 --> 00:14:41.920
 What? I know. How much ice is there then?

00:14:41.920 --> 00:14:43.120
 There's so much ice.

00:14:43.120 --> 00:14:44.960
 There's more than that, thank goodness.

00:14:44.960 --> 00:14:46.320
 Yeah, I don't know.

00:14:46.320 --> 00:14:49.840
 But we're not going to run out in like six days, which means there's so much ice.

00:14:49.840 --> 00:14:53.440
 I'm not saying this is an anti-clivic change piece.

00:14:53.440 --> 00:14:57.440
 It's like that thing about how they say that a rainforest, the size of whales,

00:14:57.440 --> 00:15:00.800
 disappears every year from Brazil.

00:15:00.800 --> 00:15:03.440
 And they've been saying that since at least I was born.

00:15:03.440 --> 00:15:05.760
 So that's a hell of a lot of rainforests, isn't it?

00:15:05.760 --> 00:15:08.160
 You guys are really coming across as strong deniers at the moment.

00:15:08.160 --> 00:15:14.000
 Well, things are getting worse, actually, because according to a study published this year,

00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:19.280
 the Antarctic is losing three times more ice than it was as recently as 2012.

00:15:19.280 --> 00:15:22.080
 And if that wasn't bad enough, we've also recently discovered

00:15:22.080 --> 00:15:25.040
 there's volcano going off under the South Pole,

00:15:25.040 --> 00:15:27.840
 which is only adding to the effects of so-called...

00:15:27.840 --> 00:15:31.920
 No, it's only adding to the effects of climate change.

00:15:31.920 --> 00:15:34.080
 But there was better news for the Antarctic this year.

00:15:34.080 --> 00:15:39.840
 Researchers discovered a super colony of 1.5 million previously unknown penguins

00:15:39.840 --> 00:15:46.880
 on the danger islands, after noticing streaks of penguin poo in NASA satellite imagery of the islands.

00:15:46.880 --> 00:15:50.880
 Do we not know about them because we were too afraid to go to danger island?

00:15:50.880 --> 00:15:51.760
 I think so.

00:15:51.760 --> 00:15:52.480
 Makes sense.

00:15:52.480 --> 00:15:54.800
 Yeah, because we had to cross the river of doom.

00:15:54.800 --> 00:16:01.760
 Until now, it was thought that this particular species of a deli penguins was on the decline.

00:16:01.760 --> 00:16:05.040
 But population levels are, in fact, relatively healthy.

00:16:05.040 --> 00:16:09.680
 And one other good piece of Antarctic news came in the form of the first ever

00:16:09.680 --> 00:16:11.360
 harvest at the South Pole.

00:16:11.360 --> 00:16:16.480
 It was grown in a giant greenhouse that uses a special liquid nutrient instead of soil

00:16:16.480 --> 00:16:18.640
 and LEDs rather than sunlight.

00:16:18.640 --> 00:16:23.760
 The technology may one day allow us to farm on other planets that are less fertile than our own.

00:16:23.760 --> 00:16:25.840
 That is, every other planet that we know of.

00:16:25.840 --> 00:16:30.560
 The first Antarctic crop was modest, consisting of 18 cucumbers,

00:16:30.560 --> 00:16:33.600
 70 radishes and 8 pounds of salad leaves.

00:16:33.600 --> 00:16:36.240
 But no iceberg lettuce.

00:16:36.240 --> 00:16:37.440
 Very good.

00:16:37.440 --> 00:16:39.120
 Missed opportunity.

00:16:39.120 --> 00:16:40.640
 Arctic.

00:16:40.640 --> 00:16:44.720
 China called itself a near-Arctic state, despite the fact that its nearest border

00:16:44.720 --> 00:16:47.200
 ends a thousand miles south of the Arctic.

00:16:47.200 --> 00:16:50.320
 China would love to increase its influence in the Arctic,

00:16:50.320 --> 00:16:53.120
 both because then it could take advantage of shorter trade routes

00:16:53.120 --> 00:16:56.400
 and because the Arctic contains a third of the world's natural gas reserves

00:16:56.400 --> 00:16:58.240
 and various other tempting resources.

00:16:58.240 --> 00:17:02.480
 So this year, China attempted to charm two key regional powers

00:17:02.480 --> 00:17:05.360
 by opening a joint observatory with Iceland

00:17:05.360 --> 00:17:07.440
 and by lending Finland a couple of pandas.

00:17:07.440 --> 00:17:11.520
 China's first ever polar cruise ship is also going to launch next year.

00:17:11.520 --> 00:17:14.480
 But it's not just China that is invading the Arctic.

00:17:14.480 --> 00:17:17.920
 This year it was discovered that the Atlantic Ocean is doing the same thing.

00:17:17.920 --> 00:17:24.080
 So since 2000, the northern balance region of the Arctic Ocean has been heating very rapidly

00:17:24.080 --> 00:17:28.320
 and as the ice cover has diminished, so has the salinity of the water

00:17:28.320 --> 00:17:32.720
 and it's been turning into an ocean with qualities very similar to those of the Atlantic.

00:17:32.720 --> 00:17:36.400
 And the result has been that Atlantic fish have started to invade traditionally

00:17:36.400 --> 00:17:38.000
 Arctic areas of sea.

00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:38.800
 That's amazing.

00:17:38.800 --> 00:17:39.280
 I know.

00:17:39.280 --> 00:17:40.720
 It's not all bad news for the Arctic.

00:17:40.720 --> 00:17:45.120
 A group of students from Bangalore University created prototype ice rebuilding machines

00:17:45.120 --> 00:17:48.960
 that spray water onto existing ice, causing it to freeze,

00:17:48.960 --> 00:17:52.640
 thicken existing ice layers and hopefully reverse the effects of climate change.

00:17:52.640 --> 00:17:54.240
 Not so cold climate change?

00:17:54.240 --> 00:17:57.280
 So reverse the effects of definitely happening climate change.

00:17:57.280 --> 00:18:00.000
 A similar technique has been tried in Canada,

00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:02.400
 but the Canadian machines are powered by petrol engines,

00:18:02.400 --> 00:18:06.560
 whereas the new Bangalore method is wind powered and therefore much more environmentally friendly.

00:18:06.560 --> 00:18:09.840
 Sadly, on the day they first tried these new devices,

00:18:09.840 --> 00:18:12.400
 there wasn't actually any ice in the Welsh water,

00:18:12.400 --> 00:18:14.080
 meaning the thing couldn't be fully tested.

00:18:14.080 --> 00:18:15.920
 But it certainly works in theory.

00:18:15.920 --> 00:18:18.160
 Apps.

00:18:18.160 --> 00:18:20.480
 Favorite apps of the year?

00:18:20.480 --> 00:18:21.200
 I go on here.

00:18:21.200 --> 00:18:21.920
 Stoneers.

00:18:21.920 --> 00:18:23.600
 There's an app for Stoneers now.

00:18:23.600 --> 00:18:26.960
 So scientists at the University of Chicago have developed a prototype app

00:18:26.960 --> 00:18:30.960
 and it's designed for cannabis users, so they can determine whether or not they are actually high.

00:18:30.960 --> 00:18:33.920
 They need an app to tell them if that's the case.

00:18:33.920 --> 00:18:35.680
 Am I Stone?

00:18:35.680 --> 00:18:40.480
 It's called assesses the effects of the drug on cognitive ability by providing the users

00:18:40.480 --> 00:18:46.640
 with a series of tasks to test their memory, reaction time, and attention span.

00:18:46.640 --> 00:18:49.360
 Tell us the structure by B in the studio.

00:18:49.360 --> 00:18:53.520
 Is that for use at parties?

00:18:53.520 --> 00:18:58.720
 You know when people take a tote, but they don't inhale because they're a bit too scared to when you're 14.

00:18:58.720 --> 00:19:01.280
 And then you get this app out and you test if they're really stone.

00:19:01.280 --> 00:19:03.200
 When you're 14 or when you're Bill Clinton.

00:19:03.200 --> 00:19:04.720
 Yeah, absolutely.

00:19:04.720 --> 00:19:05.440
 Is that this year?

00:19:05.440 --> 00:19:06.720
 The Bill Clinton drug state?

00:19:06.720 --> 00:19:07.760
 It's pretty current.

00:19:07.760 --> 00:19:08.560
 Very current.

00:19:08.560 --> 00:19:14.480
 I really like the app for people who want to become fathers that came out this year.

00:19:14.480 --> 00:19:16.160
 It's this app called Yo.

00:19:16.160 --> 00:19:20.560
 And it's an app that allows men to check their sperm count without having to see a doctor.

00:19:20.560 --> 00:19:25.680
 It comes with a slide on which men can place a drop of their semen and the app takes a picture

00:19:25.680 --> 00:19:29.520
 of the deposit, analyzes it, and assesses whether the sperm count is normal.

00:19:29.520 --> 00:19:33.280
 And when you say slide, we mean like a microscope slide, don't we?

00:19:33.280 --> 00:19:34.880
 Yes, not a playground slide.

00:19:34.880 --> 00:19:39.360
 Incidentally, James isn't allowed in any playground in the continental area.

00:19:39.360 --> 00:19:44.880
 Okay, here's a couple of apps, Glance Love and Wink Chat.

00:19:44.880 --> 00:19:46.800
 Okay, they're dating apps.

00:19:46.800 --> 00:19:47.920
 Do you fancy one of those?

00:19:47.920 --> 00:19:48.400
 Anyone?

00:19:48.400 --> 00:19:49.280
 Oh, yeah.

00:19:49.280 --> 00:19:50.960
 Well, you are a relationship.

00:19:50.960 --> 00:19:53.600
 That's right, I'd like to correct my answer.

00:19:53.600 --> 00:20:00.640
 Well, maybe you wouldn't because they were actually built by Islamist militant group Hamas.

00:20:00.640 --> 00:20:04.880
 Basically, in this app, you would pretend to be an attractive young Israeli.

00:20:04.880 --> 00:20:09.120
 And then an Israeli would download the app and then you could install malware onto their phone

00:20:09.120 --> 00:20:10.400
 and steal data.

00:20:10.400 --> 00:20:13.120
 They also built another spine program for the World Cup.

00:20:13.120 --> 00:20:14.560
 I was called Gold Cup.

00:20:14.560 --> 00:20:19.040
 But actually, one senior Israeli defense force officer said it was actually very good.

00:20:19.040 --> 00:20:19.840
 Oh, that's nice.

00:20:19.840 --> 00:20:22.160
 I've got one.

00:20:22.160 --> 00:20:26.000
 This is for people who have stomachs.

00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:28.800
 So it was developed by Australian scientists.

00:20:28.800 --> 00:20:32.480
 It's an indigestible electronic pill and you swallow it.

00:20:32.480 --> 00:20:36.240
 And then it's paired with a pocket size receiver and a mobile phone app.

00:20:36.240 --> 00:20:40.960
 And what the app allows you to do is track your fart development in real time

00:20:40.960 --> 00:20:43.440
 as it passes from the stomach to the colon.

00:20:43.440 --> 00:20:46.080
 And it's not just for leisure use.

00:20:46.080 --> 00:20:47.280
 It is actually for scientific use.

00:20:47.280 --> 00:20:52.880
 It's to collect gut data and to give us a better understanding of which foods cause digestive problems.

00:20:52.880 --> 00:20:58.720
 So can you see if you're in a sort of a very, let's say, a lift, a work environment.

00:20:58.720 --> 00:21:01.120
 Can you check and go, oh God, I've got one coming in 10 seconds.

00:21:01.120 --> 00:21:03.760
 I can see it approaching the door, the door of my body.

00:21:03.760 --> 00:21:07.040
 I think we call it the door to the hind quarters.

00:21:07.040 --> 00:21:11.040
 Is it, can you, can you get it right to the point?

00:21:11.040 --> 00:21:13.120
 I'm not sure as of that good yet, but you never know.

00:21:13.120 --> 00:21:14.560
 Maybe the 2.0 version.

00:21:14.560 --> 00:21:15.840
 Will we get enough?

00:21:16.160 --> 00:21:19.280
 I'll turn Jacinda.

00:21:19.280 --> 00:21:24.000
 New Zealand's Prime Minister gave birth to a prime miniature.

00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:29.600
 This year Jacinda Ardern became only the second world leader ever to have a baby while in office.

00:21:29.600 --> 00:21:32.720
 The other was Benazir Bhutto back in 1990.

00:21:32.720 --> 00:21:35.760
 Ardern gave birth to her daughter on the 21st of June.

00:21:35.760 --> 00:21:38.400
 Now that coincidentally is Benazir Bhutto's birthday.

00:21:38.400 --> 00:21:39.760
 So that's a nice connection.

00:21:39.760 --> 00:21:42.560
 Ardern then took six weeks of maternity leave.

00:21:42.560 --> 00:21:46.960
 Ardern first discovered she was pregnant with the prime miniature, as the baby was dubbed on Twitter.

00:21:46.960 --> 00:21:49.520
 Only six days before she came Prime Minister-elect,

00:21:49.520 --> 00:21:52.720
 and barely two months after she'd been handed the Labour Party leadership.

00:21:52.720 --> 00:21:55.280
 Labour at the time was in real difficulties.

00:21:55.280 --> 00:21:59.200
 Its popularity in the polls was at a 20-year low of 23%,

00:21:59.200 --> 00:22:02.400
 and the party had just run through four leaders in four years.

00:22:02.400 --> 00:22:08.240
 Ardern told reporters, "Everyone knows I've just accepted, with short notice, the worst job in politics."

00:22:08.960 --> 00:22:13.760
 However, only a few weeks into the campaign, Jacinda Mania, as the press called it, kicked in.

00:22:13.760 --> 00:22:17.760
 And she ended up increasing her party's vote by 50%.

00:22:17.760 --> 00:22:22.880
 In October 2017, age 37, she became the world's youngest female leader.

00:22:22.880 --> 00:22:27.040
 Ardern named her daughter, Neve Te Aroha, Ardern Gayford.

00:22:27.040 --> 00:22:34.000
 Te Aroha is a tiny farming community with a population of 3,900, near to where Ardern grew up.

00:22:34.000 --> 00:22:37.440
 The townspeople were so excited by the news that they announced plans to paint

00:22:37.440 --> 00:22:41.760
 all of the buildings pink and invited Ardern to visit so that she could take part

00:22:41.760 --> 00:22:45.520
 in the traditional Maori practice of burying the afterbirth in the earth.

00:22:45.520 --> 00:22:50.640
 Jacinda did not respond to the offer, perhaps because she was considering her options.

00:22:50.640 --> 00:22:54.640
 Earlier in the year, another Maori tribe had suggested she bury her placenta

00:22:54.640 --> 00:22:58.960
 at the spot where Britain signed the treaty that led to the founding of modern New Zealand.

00:22:58.960 --> 00:23:02.000
 As well as putting a small town on the map,

00:23:02.000 --> 00:23:06.800
 this year Jacinda fronted a national campaign to help put New Zealand back on the map.

00:23:06.800 --> 00:23:10.080
 As she pointed out in a video she made with comedian Ristarbi,

00:23:10.080 --> 00:23:14.960
 world maps produced in other countries have a worrying tendency to leave out New Zealand.

00:23:14.960 --> 00:23:18.640
 The board game risk, a map in New York Central Park Zoo,

00:23:18.640 --> 00:23:23.840
 a John Lewis tablecloth, and an episode of The Simpsons are just four of the places you won't find it

00:23:23.840 --> 00:23:27.680
 according to online communities that have been monitoring the problem for some years now.

00:23:27.680 --> 00:23:29.440
 Maybe it doesn't exist.

00:23:29.440 --> 00:23:30.080
 Maybe it doesn't.

00:23:30.080 --> 00:23:31.680
 We went there in May, it exists.

00:23:31.680 --> 00:23:34.240
 Well they said we were in New Zealand.

00:23:34.240 --> 00:23:34.720
 Good point.

00:23:34.720 --> 00:23:36.160
 It looked a lot like Wales.

00:23:36.160 --> 00:23:38.880
 Armenia.

00:23:38.880 --> 00:23:44.240
 Armenians had a snowball fight in temperatures of 25 degrees Celsius.

00:23:44.240 --> 00:23:46.560
 Surely more reward to fight at that point.

00:23:46.560 --> 00:23:53.840
 So the snow was transported from the Armenian mountains in an enormous dump truck

00:23:53.840 --> 00:23:59.200
 specifically to celebrate the fact that Prime Minister Serge Sargsyan had stepped down in the

00:23:59.200 --> 00:24:00.960
 face of huge public protests.

00:24:01.600 --> 00:24:06.880
 Some said the white snow showed the demonstrator's purity and the desire for democracy in the country.

00:24:06.880 --> 00:24:09.040
 But most just saw it as a way to have a bit of fun.

00:24:09.040 --> 00:24:14.720
 In 2015 the Armenian people voted to swap their presidential system for a parliamentary one

00:24:14.720 --> 00:24:16.640
 with a country run by a Prime Minister.

00:24:16.640 --> 00:24:20.880
 This year Sargsyan, who had been president for the previous 10 years,

00:24:20.880 --> 00:24:23.280
 said he would not try to become Prime Minister.

00:24:23.280 --> 00:24:27.360
 And indeed the opposition planted a farewell tree to say good riddance to him.

00:24:27.360 --> 00:24:30.480
 Two days later though, the Republic Party of Armenia

00:24:30.480 --> 00:24:34.400
 confirmed it would nominate Sargsyan to be the country's next Prime Minister.

00:24:34.400 --> 00:24:40.160
 A role that, thanks to new laws, meant he would be even more powerful than he had ever been as president.

00:24:40.160 --> 00:24:44.560
 During the protests that ensued, opposition leader Nikol Pashinyan

00:24:44.560 --> 00:24:50.400
 led a 200 km march from Armenia's second city of Gujumri to the capital Yerevan,

00:24:50.400 --> 00:24:52.160
 where he was promptly arrested.

00:24:52.160 --> 00:24:56.240
 Further marches followed in which some 20% of the country took part.

00:24:56.960 --> 00:25:00.640
 Sargsyan eventually bowed to pressure, saying I was wrong.

00:25:00.640 --> 00:25:05.840
 While Nikol Pashinyan was right, Pashinyan became Armenia's new Prime Minister.

00:25:05.840 --> 00:25:07.840
 Armies

00:25:07.840 --> 00:25:13.760
 American soldiers gave away the location of secret military bases by going jogging.

00:25:13.760 --> 00:25:18.160
 There's a GPS tracking company called Strava, which employs satellite information

00:25:18.160 --> 00:25:22.960
 to map the location of people using Fitbits and other wearable fitness devices all over the world.

00:25:23.600 --> 00:25:28.960
 In Europe and America, the devices are ubiquitous, but in countries like Iraq or Syria,

00:25:28.960 --> 00:25:32.080
 almost the only people using them are American soldiers.

00:25:32.080 --> 00:25:35.680
 Of course, this means that wherever the Strava map lights up red in those areas,

00:25:35.680 --> 00:25:37.600
 there's almost certainly a military base there.

00:25:37.600 --> 00:25:41.840
 The publicly available information on the map has therefore given away daily patterns,

00:25:41.840 --> 00:25:44.640
 supply routes, and even individual patrol routes.

00:25:44.640 --> 00:25:51.440
 And the worst part of it is that in 2013, the Pentagon gave out 2,500 Fitbits to its soldiers

00:25:51.440 --> 00:25:55.520
 to help fight obesity, hence unwittingly compromising its own bases.

00:25:55.520 --> 00:25:59.440
 But at least US Army personnel are trying to keep fit.

00:25:59.440 --> 00:26:04.320
 The Chinese Army has had to ban fat soldiers from promotion after a fifth of would-be-recruits

00:26:04.320 --> 00:26:05.360
 failed the wait test.

00:26:05.360 --> 00:26:10.640
 In some brigades, 40% of the soldiers failed to complete a 5-kilometer cross-country run.

00:26:10.640 --> 00:26:15.920
 Last year, the official state newspaper blamed failure to get into the Army on young men's

00:26:15.920 --> 00:26:18.160
 poor diets and excess masturbation.

00:26:18.160 --> 00:26:18.560
 What?

00:26:19.200 --> 00:26:23.120
 You know, it'll affect the sounds like I'm at least trying to get into the Chinese Army.

00:26:23.120 --> 00:26:28.240
 My application's not going to go down well.

00:26:28.240 --> 00:26:30.640
 Oh, just improve your diet and knock it off.

00:26:30.640 --> 00:26:31.440
 You know, it'll be fine.

00:26:31.440 --> 00:26:33.360
 Oh, don't knock it off.

00:26:33.360 --> 00:26:41.520
 As for the Spanish Army, it was announced in January that 180 Legionnaires from the elite rapid

00:26:41.520 --> 00:26:43.680
 reaction force were too overweight to fight.

00:26:43.680 --> 00:26:45.360
 They have since been put on a diet.

00:26:46.240 --> 00:26:50.160
 But the year's prize for the most mocked armed force goes to the Belgian Army,

00:26:50.160 --> 00:26:53.120
 which announced plans to let recruits sleep at home during their training,

00:26:53.120 --> 00:26:54.320
 so they don't get homesick.

00:26:54.320 --> 00:26:57.120
 As one horrified former paratrooper said,

00:26:57.120 --> 00:26:59.520
 "You don't go to a war zone with men who miss their mummies."

00:26:59.520 --> 00:27:03.600
 This is pretty amazing.

00:27:03.600 --> 00:27:07.920
 It was revealed this year that the US has built itself a digital North Korea.

00:27:07.920 --> 00:27:14.400
 So the idea is that American troops can practice fighting in a virtual reality of what would be

00:27:14.400 --> 00:27:17.680
 the enemy terrain before doing it for real.

00:27:17.680 --> 00:27:22.400
 What they should have done is they should have sent Donald Trump to the virtual North Korea,

00:27:22.400 --> 00:27:24.880
 make him think that he was meeting with Kim Jong-un.

00:27:24.880 --> 00:27:29.600
 We should just keep him in a virtual world where he's like the king of the whole world.

00:27:29.600 --> 00:27:30.800
 Everything got sea-sea.

00:27:30.800 --> 00:27:33.280
 Oh, no. Maybe we've all gone into that reality.

00:27:33.280 --> 00:27:37.440
 Artificial intelligence.

00:27:37.440 --> 00:27:42.960
 Scientists exposed their AI machine to an online forum,

00:27:42.960 --> 00:27:44.720
 and it became a psychopath.

00:27:44.720 --> 00:27:51.040
 The team from MIT fed the comments from a particularly angry message board into the machine,

00:27:51.040 --> 00:27:56.480
 which they called Norman. After doing so, they showed Norman inkblots from the Rorschach test,

00:27:56.480 --> 00:28:01.280
 from the Rorschach test, which are often used to give clues about a subject's personality,

00:28:01.280 --> 00:28:05.200
 and compared Norman's responses to those of another computer

00:28:05.200 --> 00:28:06.960
 that had not seen the internet comments.

00:28:06.960 --> 00:28:11.920
 Where a normal AI saw a black and white photo of a baseball glove,

00:28:11.920 --> 00:28:16.400
 Norman saw a man is murdered by machine gun in broad daylight.

00:28:16.400 --> 00:28:20.480
 And where the normal AI saw a person is holding an umbrella in the air,

00:28:20.480 --> 00:28:25.360
 Norman thought it was a man is shot dead in front of his screaming wife.

00:28:25.360 --> 00:28:27.120
 Wow.

00:28:27.120 --> 00:28:28.800
 Is Norman the name of the guy in Psycho?

00:28:28.800 --> 00:28:30.320
 Yes, I don't know, that's why they call it.

00:28:30.320 --> 00:28:31.840
 Why? Okay.

00:28:31.840 --> 00:28:34.960
 Well, you're sort of condemning him there, aren't you, by giving him that name.

00:28:34.960 --> 00:28:37.360
 Do you think nominative determinism works in robots?

00:28:37.360 --> 00:28:38.400
 I must do.

00:28:38.400 --> 00:28:39.040
 Yeah.

00:28:39.040 --> 00:28:41.040
 He just really, really loves his motherboard.

00:28:41.440 --> 00:28:42.480
 [Laughs]

00:28:42.480 --> 00:28:45.280
 In more constructive technology innovations this year,

00:28:45.280 --> 00:28:49.680
 it turns out that AI programs can be better than doctors at spotting cancer.

00:28:49.680 --> 00:28:54.480
 In one test, machines were pitted against doctors in a competition to spot

00:28:54.480 --> 00:28:55.920
 and diagnose skin cancer.

00:28:55.920 --> 00:28:59.520
 The machines got it right 95% of the time,

00:28:59.520 --> 00:29:02.160
 and the doctors only managed 87%.

00:29:02.160 --> 00:29:07.440
 And Nissan invented an AI that trundles around and scans the ground,

00:29:07.440 --> 00:29:11.280
 looking for a flatish, clear space, large enough to make a football pitch.

00:29:11.280 --> 00:29:14.960
 It then paints the markings on that area ready for a game.

00:29:14.960 --> 00:29:18.320
 It's basically the robot equivalent of putting your jumpers down as goalposts.

00:29:18.320 --> 00:29:19.360
 [Laughs]

00:29:19.360 --> 00:29:25.520
 In other AI news, there was a group from IBM who unveiled Project Debater.

00:29:25.520 --> 00:29:30.960
 That's a new artificial intelligence program that they said could successfully debate against humans.

00:29:30.960 --> 00:29:35.760
 It uses a library of millions of documents from around the world to create its arguments.

00:29:36.320 --> 00:29:40.160
 The one problem with it is that it does tend to hammer its points home.

00:29:40.160 --> 00:29:43.280
 It was reported, for instance, that during the space debate,

00:29:43.280 --> 00:29:48.560
 it repeated the point that space exploration is beneficial to the economy several times,

00:29:48.560 --> 00:29:50.480
 using very slightly different words.

00:29:50.480 --> 00:29:54.960
 So it's not a perfect technique, but at least that should not preclude Project Debater

00:29:54.960 --> 00:29:58.640
 from becoming president of the United States, ding, ding, ding.

00:29:58.640 --> 00:29:59.760
 There's a satire bell.

00:29:59.760 --> 00:30:00.160
 Hey!

00:30:00.160 --> 00:30:01.760
 Art.

00:30:01.760 --> 00:30:05.280
 So we've got some art awards to dish out.

00:30:05.920 --> 00:30:06.880
 Series of gongs?

00:30:06.880 --> 00:30:08.720
 Does that want to have a bit of art, they like?

00:30:08.720 --> 00:30:11.680
 Yeah, there's an award I'd like to give for hyper-realism.

00:30:11.680 --> 00:30:16.320
 And that is, in Hong Kong, cleaners accidentally threw away a piece of art.

00:30:16.320 --> 00:30:18.560
 And in their defense, it did look like rubbish.

00:30:18.560 --> 00:30:20.880
 This was Swiss artist Carol Mays work.

00:30:20.880 --> 00:30:25.600
 She had made an unhappy meal by recreating a discarded McDonald's box,

00:30:25.600 --> 00:30:28.400
 but with a frown instead of the trademark smile.

00:30:28.400 --> 00:30:30.240
 And so, as a result, the cleaner saw it.

00:30:30.240 --> 00:30:32.560
 Thought it was a bit of old rubbish and chucked it away.

00:30:32.560 --> 00:30:38.000
 She said, "Anishely, I didn't find it funny at all, but later I realized it meant my imitation had been a success."

00:30:38.000 --> 00:30:42.800
 Oh, what a nice positive spin to put on what was fundamentally a disaster for me.

00:30:42.800 --> 00:30:46.400
 I've got a gong to dish out for street art.

00:30:46.400 --> 00:30:49.040
 This is a bit of work by Banksy.

00:30:49.040 --> 00:30:53.920
 So the Royal Academy rejected a work by Banksy, which he had submitted to their

00:30:53.920 --> 00:30:55.840
 summer exhibition under a pseudonym.

00:30:55.840 --> 00:31:01.520
 He submitted an under the name Brian S. Gackman, which is an anagram of Banksy Anagram,

00:31:01.520 --> 00:31:04.240
 which is very clever, but it didn't get accepted.

00:31:04.240 --> 00:31:08.640
 And then a month later, the Academy contacted Banksy, asking if he would submit a piece

00:31:08.640 --> 00:31:10.240
 to their summer exhibition.

00:31:10.240 --> 00:31:14.080
 So he sent them a very slightly altered version of the same piece and they accepted it.

00:31:14.080 --> 00:31:15.680
 And they said, "Oh, this is marvelous."

00:31:15.680 --> 00:31:21.520
 A gong I'd like to give out for one piece of art is the one called Majestic Splender

00:31:21.520 --> 00:31:23.200
 in London's Hayward Art Gallery.

00:31:23.200 --> 00:31:28.560
 So this was an exhibit and it consisted of a collection of rotten fish covered in sequence.

00:31:28.560 --> 00:31:32.880
 And it spontaneously combusted a fire broke out in the gallery.

00:31:32.880 --> 00:31:33.680
 Wow.

00:31:33.680 --> 00:31:34.880
 Set fire to itself.

00:31:34.880 --> 00:31:37.040
 How does that happen?

00:31:37.040 --> 00:31:39.280
 If anything rots, it does make heat, doesn't it?

00:31:39.280 --> 00:31:40.080
 Yeah, it does.

00:31:40.080 --> 00:31:41.680
 So it must be that compost heap.

00:31:41.680 --> 00:31:43.200
 Sometimes spontaneously combusted.

00:31:43.200 --> 00:31:44.080
 I was once did that.

00:31:44.080 --> 00:31:45.680
 It was really exciting.

00:31:45.680 --> 00:31:47.600
 It's like a bonfire that you don't need to make.

00:31:47.600 --> 00:31:50.000
 And for more on that, you can hear the audiobook.

00:31:50.000 --> 00:31:52.320
 Tales from the compost heap by Anders' ex-Geek.

00:31:52.320 --> 00:31:53.440
 Cannongate 2020.

00:31:53.440 --> 00:31:58.320
 Here's no word for performance art that we want to give.

00:31:58.320 --> 00:32:04.480
 This is Australian artist Mike Pa, who had himself buried alive in a steel box under an open road

00:32:04.480 --> 00:32:09.440
 for 72 hours to symbolise the burial of Aboriginal history.

00:32:09.440 --> 00:32:13.920
 Unfortunately, the chief of the Tasmanian Aboriginal Centre wasn't exactly impressed.

00:32:13.920 --> 00:32:18.960
 He said, "The idea of our Aboriginal history being hidden is a valid point.

00:32:18.960 --> 00:32:22.800
 The most effective way of bringing it out is not climbing under the road."

00:32:22.800 --> 00:32:24.480
 Asteroids.

00:32:25.280 --> 00:32:30.320
 Scientists concluded that birds escaped death by asteroid thanks to their inability to fly.

00:32:30.320 --> 00:32:35.680
 According to a team of evolutionary scientists, the fossil record shows that the asteroid that

00:32:35.680 --> 00:32:42.240
 wiped out the dinosaurs 66 million years ago destroyed so much tree life that all flying birds

00:32:42.240 --> 00:32:44.080
 who lived in trees died out.

00:32:44.080 --> 00:32:49.040
 This meant that only the flightless, ground-dwelling, emuleic ones survived,

00:32:49.040 --> 00:32:52.800
 and those survivors must therefore be the common assisters of all birds today.

00:32:53.600 --> 00:32:57.920
 Birds didn't relearn to fly until thousands of years later when the forest returned.

00:32:57.920 --> 00:33:04.160
 This year, to avoid being hit by giant asteroids in the future, Russian scientists blasted tiny

00:33:04.160 --> 00:33:08.640
 centimetre wide rocks with lasers, simulating the effect of nuclear bombs.

00:33:08.640 --> 00:33:14.160
 They hoped to be able to scale this up to work on asteroids that are even wider than an inch in future.

00:33:14.160 --> 00:33:19.920
 Not to be outdone, NASA announced plans for an eight-tonned spaceship called Hammer,

00:33:19.920 --> 00:33:22.880
 which will be able to push an asteroid out of the Earth's path.

00:33:23.840 --> 00:33:28.160
 Japan also deployed asteroid striking technology, but for different reasons.

00:33:28.160 --> 00:33:33.760
 It's Hyabusa 2 spacecraft, which has spent the last four years traveling through space,

00:33:33.760 --> 00:33:39.200
 arrived at its target, the Ryugu asteroid, currently located about 200 million miles away

00:33:39.200 --> 00:33:40.480
 between Earth and Mars.

00:33:40.480 --> 00:33:46.640
 The plan is that next year, Hyabusa 2 will release a projectile that will smash into the asteroid

00:33:46.640 --> 00:33:52.080
 at a mile a second, making a crater that will be filmed and beam back to Earth so that astronomers

00:33:52.080 --> 00:33:57.840
 can better understand how craters are formed. According to one scientist, the Hyabusa 2 projectile

00:33:57.840 --> 00:34:03.760
 is a kinetic impactor, which is what we say in polite company when we don't want to say the word bomb.

00:34:03.760 --> 00:34:06.320
 Look out, he's got a kinetic impactor!

00:34:06.320 --> 00:34:08.960
 Astronauts

00:34:08.960 --> 00:34:13.840
 NASA sent a man with a fear of heights to the International Space Station.

00:34:13.840 --> 00:34:21.440
 Astronaut Andrew Foystal, who flew up to the ISS in March, confessed to this mild phobia not long

00:34:21.440 --> 00:34:26.880
 before leaving on his six-month space mission. Fortunately, his fear of heights doesn't affect him too

00:34:26.880 --> 00:34:31.680
 badly when he's 250 miles above the planet, but it is there, he said.

00:34:31.680 --> 00:34:37.840
 Three months into his mission, Foystal became the commander of the ISS, and while on board conducted

00:34:37.840 --> 00:34:45.600
 over 250 science investigations and technology demonstrations. He also started a band called Astro-Hawaii,

00:34:45.600 --> 00:34:51.520
 which featured five of the ISS' astronauts and cosmonauts. Their instruments included two guitars,

00:34:51.520 --> 00:34:56.560
 two flutes, and an improvised drum which was actually a metallic unit that stores all of the Russian

00:34:56.560 --> 00:35:03.520
 cosmonauts feces. In other astronaut news, the world said goodbye to two Apollo moonwalkers.

00:35:03.520 --> 00:35:09.040
 In January, John Young died. He was a member of the Apollo 16 lunar mission and was not only the

00:35:09.040 --> 00:35:14.080
 ninth person to stand on the moon, but also sparked a review into the safety of crumbs in space

00:35:14.080 --> 00:35:20.000
 after he sneaked to corned beef sandwich up there. Five months later, we lost Alan Bean,

00:35:20.000 --> 00:35:24.800
 who as well as being the fourth man to stand on the moon was also a painter. Buzz Aldrin will call

00:35:24.800 --> 00:35:29.600
 me up sometimes, Bean once said, wanting to talk about space stuff because he's really into space

00:35:29.600 --> 00:35:34.560
 stuff. And I said, "Quit talking to me, Buzz. I'm not an astronaut anymore. I don't call you to ask

00:35:34.560 --> 00:35:40.240
 you what colors to paint these things." Meanwhile, in India, a father and son were arrested after

00:35:40.240 --> 00:35:46.640
 conning a businessman out of 160,000 pounds by pretending to work for NASA. The pair successfully

00:35:46.640 --> 00:35:51.600
 convinced the man they had invented a device that could generate electricity from thunderbolts.

00:35:51.600 --> 00:35:57.680
 They even performed a demonstration for him in silver space suits. After the businessman

00:35:57.680 --> 00:36:02.960
 realized he was being joked by the pair, the police were called, and the astronauts were arrested.

00:36:02.960 --> 00:36:10.720
 Nice. Thank you very much. Attorneys. Numerous lawyers refuse to represent

00:36:10.720 --> 00:36:16.240
 the US president for fear he damaged their reputation. When Donald Trump's leader,

00:36:16.240 --> 00:36:21.680
 Tony John Dowled resigned over a disagreement with his client. The president hunted for a replacement

00:36:21.680 --> 00:36:26.240
 to represent his interests in the Robert Muller led investigation into alleged Russian meddling

00:36:26.240 --> 00:36:32.560
 in the US 2016 election. However, a number of lawyers who were approached later said they turned

00:36:32.560 --> 00:36:36.880
 the offer down because they were concerned that defending him might damage their professional

00:36:36.880 --> 00:36:43.760
 reputation. According to Ted Boutrus, one of L.A.'s top lawyers, Trump is a notoriously

00:36:43.760 --> 00:36:48.720
 difficult client who disregards the advice of his lawyers and asks them to engage in questionable

00:36:48.720 --> 00:36:54.400
 activities. Trump was eventually left with only two lawyers on his legal team, Ty Cobb and Jay

00:36:54.400 --> 00:36:59.920
 Seculo, neither of whom came from traditional law firms. Eventually, the former mayor of New York,

00:36:59.920 --> 00:37:06.000
 Rudy Giuliani joined the team. He's had dealings with Donald before. A video from the year 2000

00:37:06.000 --> 00:37:11.120
 resurfaced this year showing him at a charity event dressed as a woman and calling Trump a dirty

00:37:11.120 --> 00:37:15.600
 boy for touching his fake breasts. That doesn't sound like the president. I know.

00:37:15.600 --> 00:37:22.240
 Also, we should add, the fake breasts were sort of part of the bra. Rudy Giuliani doesn't have

00:37:22.240 --> 00:37:27.120
 actual fake breasts. Right, he has not pressed implants is what you're saying. Yeah, he was just

00:37:27.120 --> 00:37:32.080
 just dressed up. Yeah. The breast touching video was not the only problem with Trump's new lawyer.

00:37:32.080 --> 00:37:37.840
 The DC bar website list Giuliani as an inactive attorney, meaning he's not licensed to practice

00:37:37.840 --> 00:37:42.240
 in the district of Columbia. Consequently, should Trump ever have to appear in court during the

00:37:42.240 --> 00:37:48.560
 Miller investigation, his own lawyer won't be able to attend. Lawyers and breasts met again

00:37:48.560 --> 00:37:54.720
 this year when, owing to a computer malfunction, every single lawyer in Utah received a photo of a

00:37:54.720 --> 00:37:58.720
 woman's naked breasts. Can I just interrupt you just for a second just to say Lawyers and

00:37:58.720 --> 00:38:05.760
 Breast met again their sentence in the book. Thank you. That's my vote. Agreed. The Utah State Bar

00:38:05.760 --> 00:38:10.000
 sent an event invitation to all of them and somehow managed to attach the image by mistake.

00:38:10.000 --> 00:38:15.440
 But despite technological hiccups, courts increasingly rely on machines to replace humans.

00:38:15.440 --> 00:38:21.120
 For instance, the series Fraud Office and the UK announced they'd be using evidence-sifting robots

00:38:21.120 --> 00:38:26.880
 on all their casework in future since one robot can scan more than half a million documents a day.

00:38:26.880 --> 00:38:28.880
 Orctions

00:38:28.880 --> 00:38:35.120
 Russell Crowe held an auction called The Art of Divorce on his wedding anniversary.

00:38:35.120 --> 00:38:40.240
 The auction held at Sotheby's Australia included a car used on the day of Crowe's wedding

00:38:40.240 --> 00:38:46.000
 and some jewellery that once belonged to his ex-wife Danielle. Crowe said the reason he had decided

00:38:46.000 --> 00:38:50.880
 to go ahead with it was that he was keen to try and turn something bleak into something joyful.

00:38:51.520 --> 00:38:54.880
 The auction was streamed live on Facebook and lasted five hours,

00:38:54.880 --> 00:39:00.480
 during which time members of the public were able to bid on 227 lots that also included

00:39:00.480 --> 00:39:08.000
 a leather jock strap and a life-sized rubber horse. 79,788 dollars of the 3.7 million

00:39:08.000 --> 00:39:13.440
 Crowe made in that auction came from comedian John Oliver's TV show Last Week Tonight,

00:39:13.440 --> 00:39:17.680
 which bought numerous bits of Crowe memorabilia including the jock strap which the actor

00:39:17.680 --> 00:39:23.440
 wore in the movie Cinder element. Oliver then lent the underwear to an Alaskan blockbuster video

00:39:23.440 --> 00:39:28.240
 store in the hope that by displaying it the jock strap might attract more customers for them.

00:39:28.240 --> 00:39:34.960
 The store has since closed. A joke feud then broke out with Crowe returning the gesture by using

00:39:34.960 --> 00:39:41.840
 the 79,788 dollars to fund a ward at Australia Zoo's Wildlife Hospital to treat

00:39:41.840 --> 00:39:48.720
 Climidia in Koalas. A plaque on the wall of the ward now reads The John Oliver Koala Climidia Ward.

00:39:48.720 --> 00:39:54.160
 Other auctions around the world featured a broken teapot originally bought for 15 pounds,

00:39:54.160 --> 00:40:00.960
 which was sold for 575,000 pounds. The original map of Winnie the Pooh's Hundred Acre Wood,

00:40:00.960 --> 00:40:06.400
 which sold for 430,000 pounds, setting a new world record for a book illustration,

00:40:06.400 --> 00:40:15.120
 a 1973 job application by Steve Jobs, which fetched $174,000, despite not identifying what job jobs

00:40:15.120 --> 00:40:22.160
 was applying for. And a lunch with billionaire Warren Buffett was auctioned for $3.3 million.

00:40:22.160 --> 00:40:28.880
 Was it a Buffett? Sadly not. What a missed opportunity. And lastly, a postcard from a passenger

00:40:28.880 --> 00:40:34.080
 aboard the Titanic failed to sell when it didn't meet its reserve of 10,000 pounds,

00:40:34.080 --> 00:40:38.800
 addressed to a misscreen in Birmingham. It included the words "Wish you were here,

00:40:38.800 --> 00:40:50.000
 it is a lovely boat, and it would do you good." Nice so tragic.
