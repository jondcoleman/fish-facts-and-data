00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,920
 Merry Christmas, everyone. Welcome to this week's episode of Fish. Hang on a second. It's not Friday. What's this doing here?

2
00:00:05,920 --> 00:00:11,000
 It's a bonus episode. That's right. You've been good and Santa's brought you an audio present.

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:18,400
 An extra goodie that you weren't expecting. What you're about to hear is the first letter of our audio book of the year 2018.

4
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:23,800
 We sat in a studio. We read out our book. It lasts about nine hours long. It's all of us interjecting on each other.

5
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:26,240
 We really love it. And we thought, as is Christmas day...

6
00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:31,080
 Can you not interject on each other? Just as we've done.

7
00:00:31,080 --> 00:00:33,080
 That's right. Okay.

8
00:00:33,080 --> 00:00:42,240
 So, yeah, we were in the studio. It was a long, long, hard session of us constantly interjecting all over each other.

9
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:47,720
 Shall we just say, "On with the show?"

10
00:00:47,720 --> 00:00:51,920
 It's the letter A, and they're by the rest of it. Okay, on with the show.

11
00:00:51,920 --> 00:01:01,400
 A, in which we learn why flies can't fly with American Airlines, whose reputation might be tarnished by working with the White House,

12
00:01:01,400 --> 00:01:07,000
 who bought Russell Crowe's Jockstrap, how to tell your astronauts from your astronauts,

13
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:12,440
 and why the Belgian army are such mummies, boys. A, A.

14
00:01:12,440 --> 00:01:17,600
 Okay, we're starting the book with A, a good place to start. No ad vaque news this year. That's tragic.

15
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:23,600
 But we found quite a lot of A, A news, didn't we? Too much, I would say.

16
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:31,520
 Okay, here's one. American Airlines, which is an AA, they banned passengers from traveling with emotional support insects.

17
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:33,840
 Did that affect many people?

18
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:36,400
 No, probably not even that many insects either, right?

19
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:40,160
 Yeah, I don't know how emotionally supportive insects can be.

20
00:01:40,160 --> 00:01:43,920
 So, American Airlines, they changed their rules on emotional support animals this year,

21
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:49,040
 and that means their insects now prohibited, along with any animals with hooves,

22
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:54,400
 any emotional support amphibians, emotional support ferrets, emotional support hedgehogs,

23
00:01:54,400 --> 00:02:02,880
 and the move was a response to an 84% rise in urine, feces, and aggression-related incidents involving animals since 2016.

24
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:07,680
 Well, American, I need to ban me if that's the problem.

25
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:11,600
 We found more AA news as well, but we found AA news about the alcoholics anonymous.

26
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:15,920
 Oh, yeah. So, there was a man who bought the original alcoholics anonymous document

27
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:20,560
 and he did so, and then he waived his anonymity in order to help alcoholics.

28
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:22,800
 Wow, so he's no longer anonymous.

29
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:27,360
 He's not. So, there's this founding book of alcoholics anonymous, which is from 1935,

30
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:32,400
 and this year it was sold at Northland in Los Angeles for $2.4 million,

31
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:36,880
 and it gets called the Big Book, because it's very big, because it's paper is very thick.

32
00:02:36,880 --> 00:02:42,800
 And the man who bought it was the man who owns the Indianapolis Colts, American football team,

33
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:46,560
 and he's been battling his own addictions over the last two years. He's called Jim Urce,

34
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:50,400
 and he decided to go public, and he said that he would make a cabinet for the book

35
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:55,040
 and display it for part of the year at Alcoholics Anonymous's Headquarters in New York in order to

36
00:02:55,040 --> 00:03:00,320
 help inspire alcoholics to give up drink. Oh, that's a nice story. That's very cool.

37
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:07,200
 Another AA, the first AA that springs to mind, really, is the AA battery, right? And this year,

38
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:13,920
 scientists invented a battery that never runs out ever. So, it's AA size. It was created by Osio,

39
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:19,520
 a wireless technology company that's based in Washington state, and it's called Forever Battery.

40
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:24,480
 It comes with a transmitter that constantly keeps it fully charged by a Wi-Fi-like waves.

41
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:29,040
 So, just in the air. The air charges it. You are an expert in this kind of technology,

42
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:34,240
 I practically invented it. Although it has to be that the battery and the transmitter

43
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:37,520
 are within 10 meters of each other. It's a small caveat. It's in a small print.

44
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:43,040
 Hope is it that one day these kind of setups will be available in every single home.

45
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:48,800
 Oh, wow. There's one final AA, which is that the automobile association found that there was one

46
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:54,080
 breakdown they couldn't fix. A former executive chairman at the automobile association

47
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:58,160
 sued the company for wrongful dismissal after he was fired for gross misconduct.

48
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:02,160
 He said he was stressed and overworked when he got into a fight with a colleague and that the

49
00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:07,600
 company had no regard for his mental well-being. So, essentially, his argument appears to be that the AA

50
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:11,920
 couldn't deal with his breakdown. Are they using that on their advertising in future?

51
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:16,160
 There's only one breakdown the AA can't fix. And it's your emotional breakdown.

52
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:22,480
 Advertising. Roger Federer lost the rights to his own initials.

53
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:28,000
 So, this is the RF logo, which if you've ever watched a tennis game in the last

54
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:32,640
 15 years, you'll know he has sort of sewn embroidered into his shirt in kind of gold.

55
00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:38,800
 And it's owned by Nike. And they've been his sponsor for 24 years, but this year he switched

56
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:44,960
 allegiance to the Japanese company Uniqlo. However, the initials are still owned by Nike.

57
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:49,680
 And so, he now has to reach an agreement with Nike to get them back because, as he put it,

58
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:54,880
 they are my initials, they are mine, which is almost fair enough. But he can draw comfort,

59
00:04:54,880 --> 00:05:01,040
 Roger Federer, from the fact that Uniqlo is paying him $300 million just to wear their clothes

60
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:06,320
 on court over the next 10 years. Well, Uniqlo and most other advertisers are hoping to maximize

61
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:10,800
 their public exposure in ways like this. The company that makes Skittles produce an advert this

62
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:16,800
 year that will only ever be seen by one person. That's teenager and Skittles fan Marcos Menendez,

63
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:22,160
 who, as a publicity stunt, was shut in a room and shown an advert that was made specially for him,

64
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:27,200
 while his reaction was streamed live on Facebook to thousands of viewers. He revealed after

65
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:32,240
 was what was in the advert that only he saw apparently it featured friend star David Schwimmer shooting

66
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:38,400
 lasers from his mouth at Marcos' mother and turning her into Skittles. Cool. So it seems pretty great.

67
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:42,960
 Another company that was probably a bit less happy with the way it's goods were being advertised

68
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:48,080
 was Team Manufacturer Twinnings. So Twinnings complained to the advertising standards authority

69
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:53,920
 after Poundland decided to publish a tweet. This was last Christmas and the tweet showed a naughty

70
00:05:53,920 --> 00:06:00,480
 elf squatting over a female doll and holding a Twinnings team bag above her face. That is naughty.

71
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:05,120
 Yeah, the accompanying caption on the tweet read, "How do you take your tea one lump or two?"

72
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:11,280
 So yeah, the advertising standards authority ruled the ad was irresponsible. But hilarious.

73
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:18,160
 Meanwhile, the truth of that old advertising mantra that sex sells was demonstrated in the monkey world

74
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:24,080
 this year. So a group of male macaques was shown pictures of either dominant male macaque faces or

75
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:32,320
 subordinate male faces or female macaque hindquarters bottoms alongside logos of brands like Pizza Hut

76
00:06:32,320 --> 00:06:37,520
 and Adidas and the macaque showed a very clear preference for the logos they associated with the

77
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:42,800
 hindquarters. You wrote the article didn't you? I did, yes. You chose to use hindquarters. That's what I

78
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:49,520
 call them. I was just dumbing it down for the masses. Advice. The government advised people being

79
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:55,600
 deported to Jamaica to put on a Jamaican accent. Labour MP David Lamy drew attention this year to

80
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:59,760
 a leaflet given to British residents being deported to Jamaica, published when Theresa May was

81
00:06:59,760 --> 00:07:06,080
 home secretary. As he pointed out, it included such tips as "try to be Jamaican, use local accents

82
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:11,040
 and dialect." And the pamphlets existence came to light during the Windrush scandal when it was

83
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:16,560
 revealed that hundreds of British subjects who had arrived in the UK between 1948 and 1970

84
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:22,880
 had been wrongly detained, denied legal rights, lost homes, jobs and benefits, and in at least 63

85
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:27,440
 cases have been deported even though they had originally been given an automatic right to remain

86
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:32,480
 permanently in the UK. And to make matters worse, the government had destroyed all their landing

87
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:38,160
 cards back in 2010 to cut back on stored paperwork, so the Windrush generation had no way of proving

88
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:43,600
 their status. That was some bad advice. More bad advice was in preparation for the World Cup,

89
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:47,760
 where Argentina's Football Association issued a manual to its players and officials

90
00:07:47,760 --> 00:07:52,480
 that contained a chapter on how to pick up women while they were in Russia. Tips included,

91
00:07:52,480 --> 00:07:56,640
 make sure your clean, smell good and dress well. Is that bad advice? That's great advice.

92
00:07:57,280 --> 00:08:03,440
 Bad to give the advice. That's right. And Russian girls hate boring men, never ask trite questions.

93
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:08,960
 Be original. They don't like to be seen as objects. Can I just say, I'm married to a Russian girl,

94
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:14,160
 and if they don't like boring men, then I'm in serious trouble. So after that leave,

95
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:18,240
 that was given out. The Argentine Football Association insisted that it had been mistakenly included,

96
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:22,400
 and when it was noticed, they had the booklets returned and they hurriedly ripped out the offending

97
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:29,120
 pages. Alexa. Alexa got in trouble for laughing at her owners.

98
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:34,720
 Numerous customers this year reported that Amazon's voice-activated assistant was breaking out into

99
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:39,840
 spontaneous laughter when she wasn't even supposed to be switched on. Amazon fixed the glitch,

100
00:08:39,840 --> 00:08:44,480
 explaining it was caused by echo devices mistakenly misinterpreting words it overheard,

101
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:50,720
 as the phrase Alexa laugh. Amazon was not able to explain why one device started telling random

102
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:55,360
 jokes without being asked, and why another woke up its owner around midnight and announced

103
00:08:55,360 --> 00:09:00,880
 he's home. He's home for no apparent reason. In some cases, Alexa even went so far as to place

104
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:06,720
 orders for unwanted products. So one woman tried to have an Alexa TV advert banned, claiming that her

105
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:11,200
 echo dot had ordered pet food, because it overheard someone on the ad asking for it.

106
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:17,440
 And White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders tweeted that her two-year-old son had inadvertently

107
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:24,000
 ordered a Batman toy by shouting Batman repeatedly into their device. Perhaps even more unnervingly,

108
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:28,800
 one couple discovered Alexa had recorded their private conversation and sent it to one of their

109
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:33,760
 contacts. They only realized this when he phoned to inform them he just received a recording of

110
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:42,320
 them discussing hardwood floors. Given all of this, customers might not be reassured by the news

111
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:47,360
 that Amazon has filed a patent for voice sniffing technology, which would theoretically let its

112
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:53,440
 echo speakers listen to people all the time to ascertain their likes and dislikes. It's no wonder

113
00:09:53,440 --> 00:10:00,000
 perhaps that the name Alexa has declined in popularity by 33% in the US since 2015.

114
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:04,720
 I like as well the Church of England launched an app this year that allows you to ask Alexa questions

115
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:09,440
 like "Where's my nearest church?" or "Please read me the Lord's Prayer. What is the Bible?"

116
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:14,720
 Not doing well as a "How can a benevolent and omnipotent God allow evil?"

117
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:26,400
 An all-you-can-eat restaurant had to shut after two weeks because customers ate all they could.

118
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:32,960
 Jiaminer, a restaurant in Chengdu, China, shut its doors for good after launching an all-you-can-eat

119
00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:39,840
 membership card, which, for 120 yuan, which is about 13 pounds, guaranteed unlimited food for a month.

120
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:45,040
 The owners said that they were aware they might lose some money initially, but hope that their loyalty

121
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:49,440
 scheme would not only attract clients, but would allow them to negotiate discounts from food and

122
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:54,560
 drink suppliers. What they didn't count on was how many customers would take advantage of that deal.

123
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:59,680
 In the first 14 days, the restaurant attracted more than 7,000 diners, many of whom were repeat

124
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:04,240
 customers or people who had borrowed cards from family and friends. After just two weeks,

125
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:09,040
 the restaurant had fallen into debt to the tune of 50,000 pounds and was forced to shut.

126
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:12,720
 The owners cited their poor management as the problem.

127
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:13,680
 Sounds about right.

128
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:19,120
 They also had problem at Brighton's Big Cheese Festival this year. Did you see that?

129
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:24,080
 They ran out of cheese. They said it was due to the bad weather which meant that the traders couldn't

130
00:11:24,080 --> 00:11:28,720
 get there, but one person wrote in social media, "Hmm, what's expecting more cheese?"

131
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:34,160
 Someone else said, "I'd rather have gone to the supermarket. Less queues, more cheese."

132
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:40,640
 And a couple of months after that, I think, didn't an all-you-can-eat pizza festival

133
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:42,160
 not in Hill run out of pizza?

134
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:45,760
 It was just to go to an all-you-can-eat pizza festival. Who can eat more than one pizza?

135
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:50,640
 Well, two people on this table, good. We're not going to specify which.

136
00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:53,760
 Who can manage more than half a small pizza?

137
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:58,320
 Animal races.

138
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:03,840
 A snail racing competition was postponed because the snails were too sluggish.

139
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:08,080
 Now that's their words, not my words. That's not me trying to make a terrible joke.

140
00:12:08,080 --> 00:12:09,280
 That's the snail's words.

141
00:12:09,280 --> 00:12:15,120
 Say a apologise afterwards, having two sluggish words. Sorry, guys. Post-race interview.

142
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:21,760
 So this was a race that was due to take place in February at the Dartmoor Union pub in Plymouth.

143
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:25,840
 But the organizers went to the pet shop to collect the snails and they were told that the cold weather

144
00:12:25,840 --> 00:12:30,720
 had made them extra sleepy. This pub probably should have taken some advice from the organizers

145
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:35,600
 of the World Snail Racing Championships, which always takes place in July in Norfolk.

146
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:38,960
 Now they use a special damp cloth to keep their snails happy.

147
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:43,200
 The human competitors in that one, though, they don't always show the same compassion.

148
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:46,160
 The owner of the winner this year, Joe Waterfield, said,

149
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:50,240
 "I pulled him out this morning and told him if he didn't win, I would squash him."

150
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:56,400
 Also, what a fix that the World Snail Racing Championships always takes place in Norfolk.

151
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:58,240
 FIFA could learn a thing or two from these guys.

152
00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:00,960
 I think the next one isn't Qatar, actually.

153
00:13:00,960 --> 00:13:07,840
 So the animal race with the youngest participants this year was definitely the great "high-high".

154
00:13:07,840 --> 00:13:17,040
 The great "he-he" sperm race set up by a New Zealand charity to raise money for the "he-he" bird,

155
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:20,080
 which is an endangered yet relatively unknown species.

156
00:13:20,080 --> 00:13:23,920
 sperm samples were taken from four different "he-he" colonies,

157
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:28,480
 and people were encouraged to place a ten dollar, that's ten New Zealand dollar bet,

158
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:30,720
 on which of the samples would swim the fastest.

159
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:37,120
 According to the website, the male with the fastest sperm was CP11870,

160
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:39,520
 from Tiritiri, Matangi Island.

161
00:13:39,520 --> 00:13:44,400
 Also known as a male who was famous for his natty pink leg bands,

162
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:46,320
 but secure in his masculinity.

163
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:49,200
 Sorry, the sperm had pink leg bands.

164
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:53,600
 No, so it was the "he-he" bird who had the fast sperm.

165
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:57,200
 Who also had leg bands who was also secure in his masculinity.

166
00:13:57,200 --> 00:14:00,080
 So was the sperm with the name...

167
00:14:00,080 --> 00:14:04,320
 I don't know what his legs were like, but is that his name, or is that the "he-he" bird's name?

168
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:07,680
 CP118 is called CP11870.

169
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:10,480
 Not the sperm, because then they would have to name every sperm,

170
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:12,880
 and that's even just announcing the race.

171
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:14,480
 You get the racers what they get.

172
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:15,680
 You get very long-term books.

173
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:17,280
 I don't think you get sperm-name books.

174
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:26,800
 Antarctic. Every minute the Antarctic loses enough ice to keep the UK in slushies for an entire year.

175
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:30,240
 In fact, in the time it took me to read that sentence,

176
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:33,920
 Antarctica lost 12 Olympic swimming pools worth of ice,

177
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:38,880
 with more than a gigaton, that's a billion tons of ice disappearing every two days.

178
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:41,920
 What? I know. How much ice is there then?

179
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:43,120
 There's so much ice.

180
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:44,960
 There's more than that, thank goodness.

181
00:14:44,960 --> 00:14:46,320
 Yeah, I don't know.

182
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:49,840
 But we're not going to run out in like six days, which means there's so much ice.

183
00:14:49,840 --> 00:14:53,440
 I'm not saying this is an anti-clivic change piece.

184
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:57,440
 It's like that thing about how they say that a rainforest, the size of whales,

185
00:14:57,440 --> 00:15:00,800
 disappears every year from Brazil.

186
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:03,440
 And they've been saying that since at least I was born.

187
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:05,760
 So that's a hell of a lot of rainforests, isn't it?

188
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:08,160
 You guys are really coming across as strong deniers at the moment.

189
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:14,000
 Well, things are getting worse, actually, because according to a study published this year,

190
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:19,280
 the Antarctic is losing three times more ice than it was as recently as 2012.

191
00:15:19,280 --> 00:15:22,080
 And if that wasn't bad enough, we've also recently discovered

192
00:15:22,080 --> 00:15:25,040
 there's volcano going off under the South Pole,

193
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:27,840
 which is only adding to the effects of so-called...

194
00:15:27,840 --> 00:15:31,920
 No, it's only adding to the effects of climate change.

195
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:34,080
 But there was better news for the Antarctic this year.

196
00:15:34,080 --> 00:15:39,840
 Researchers discovered a super colony of 1.5 million previously unknown penguins

197
00:15:39,840 --> 00:15:46,880
 on the danger islands, after noticing streaks of penguin poo in NASA satellite imagery of the islands.

198
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:50,880
 Do we not know about them because we were too afraid to go to danger island?

199
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:51,760
 I think so.

200
00:15:51,760 --> 00:15:52,480
 Makes sense.

201
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:54,800
 Yeah, because we had to cross the river of doom.

202
00:15:54,800 --> 00:16:01,760
 Until now, it was thought that this particular species of a deli penguins was on the decline.

203
00:16:01,760 --> 00:16:05,040
 But population levels are, in fact, relatively healthy.

204
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:09,680
 And one other good piece of Antarctic news came in the form of the first ever

205
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:11,360
 harvest at the South Pole.

206
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:16,480
 It was grown in a giant greenhouse that uses a special liquid nutrient instead of soil

207
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:18,640
 and LEDs rather than sunlight.

208
00:16:18,640 --> 00:16:23,760
 The technology may one day allow us to farm on other planets that are less fertile than our own.

209
00:16:23,760 --> 00:16:25,840
 That is, every other planet that we know of.

210
00:16:25,840 --> 00:16:30,560
 The first Antarctic crop was modest, consisting of 18 cucumbers,

211
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:33,600
 70 radishes and 8 pounds of salad leaves.

212
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:36,240
 But no iceberg lettuce.

213
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:37,440
 Very good.

214
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:39,120
 Missed opportunity.

215
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:40,640
 Arctic.

216
00:16:40,640 --> 00:16:44,720
 China called itself a near-Arctic state, despite the fact that its nearest border

217
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:47,200
 ends a thousand miles south of the Arctic.

218
00:16:47,200 --> 00:16:50,320
 China would love to increase its influence in the Arctic,

219
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:53,120
 both because then it could take advantage of shorter trade routes

220
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:56,400
 and because the Arctic contains a third of the world's natural gas reserves

221
00:16:56,400 --> 00:16:58,240
 and various other tempting resources.

222
00:16:58,240 --> 00:17:02,480
 So this year, China attempted to charm two key regional powers

223
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:05,360
 by opening a joint observatory with Iceland

224
00:17:05,360 --> 00:17:07,440
 and by lending Finland a couple of pandas.

225
00:17:07,440 --> 00:17:11,520
 China's first ever polar cruise ship is also going to launch next year.

226
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:14,480
 But it's not just China that is invading the Arctic.

227
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:17,920
 This year it was discovered that the Atlantic Ocean is doing the same thing.

228
00:17:17,920 --> 00:17:24,080
 So since 2000, the northern balance region of the Arctic Ocean has been heating very rapidly

229
00:17:24,080 --> 00:17:28,320
 and as the ice cover has diminished, so has the salinity of the water

230
00:17:28,320 --> 00:17:32,720
 and it's been turning into an ocean with qualities very similar to those of the Atlantic.

231
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:36,400
 And the result has been that Atlantic fish have started to invade traditionally

232
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:38,000
 Arctic areas of sea.

233
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:38,800
 That's amazing.

234
00:17:38,800 --> 00:17:39,280
 I know.

235
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:40,720
 It's not all bad news for the Arctic.

236
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:45,120
 A group of students from Bangalore University created prototype ice rebuilding machines

237
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:48,960
 that spray water onto existing ice, causing it to freeze,

238
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:52,640
 thicken existing ice layers and hopefully reverse the effects of climate change.

239
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:54,240
 Not so cold climate change?

240
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:57,280
 So reverse the effects of definitely happening climate change.

241
00:17:57,280 --> 00:18:00,000
 A similar technique has been tried in Canada,

242
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,400
 but the Canadian machines are powered by petrol engines,

243
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:06,560
 whereas the new Bangalore method is wind powered and therefore much more environmentally friendly.

244
00:18:06,560 --> 00:18:09,840
 Sadly, on the day they first tried these new devices,

245
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:12,400
 there wasn't actually any ice in the Welsh water,

246
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:14,080
 meaning the thing couldn't be fully tested.

247
00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:15,920
 But it certainly works in theory.

248
00:18:15,920 --> 00:18:18,160
 Apps.

249
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:20,480
 Favorite apps of the year?

250
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:21,200
 I go on here.

251
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:21,920
 Stoneers.

252
00:18:21,920 --> 00:18:23,600
 There's an app for Stoneers now.

253
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:26,960
 So scientists at the University of Chicago have developed a prototype app

254
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:30,960
 and it's designed for cannabis users, so they can determine whether or not they are actually high.

255
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:33,920
 They need an app to tell them if that's the case.

256
00:18:33,920 --> 00:18:35,680
 Am I Stone?

257
00:18:35,680 --> 00:18:40,480
 It's called assesses the effects of the drug on cognitive ability by providing the users

258
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:46,640
 with a series of tasks to test their memory, reaction time, and attention span.

259
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:49,360
 Tell us the structure by B in the studio.

260
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:53,520
 Is that for use at parties?

261
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:58,720
 You know when people take a tote, but they don't inhale because they're a bit too scared to when you're 14.

262
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:01,280
 And then you get this app out and you test if they're really stone.

263
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:03,200
 When you're 14 or when you're Bill Clinton.

264
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:04,720
 Yeah, absolutely.

265
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:05,440
 Is that this year?

266
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:06,720
 The Bill Clinton drug state?

267
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:07,760
 It's pretty current.

268
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:08,560
 Very current.

269
00:19:08,560 --> 00:19:14,480
 I really like the app for people who want to become fathers that came out this year.

270
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:16,160
 It's this app called Yo.

271
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:20,560
 And it's an app that allows men to check their sperm count without having to see a doctor.

272
00:19:20,560 --> 00:19:25,680
 It comes with a slide on which men can place a drop of their semen and the app takes a picture

273
00:19:25,680 --> 00:19:29,520
 of the deposit, analyzes it, and assesses whether the sperm count is normal.

274
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:33,280
 And when you say slide, we mean like a microscope slide, don't we?

275
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:34,880
 Yes, not a playground slide.

276
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:39,360
 Incidentally, James isn't allowed in any playground in the continental area.

277
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:44,880
 Okay, here's a couple of apps, Glance Love and Wink Chat.

278
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:46,800
 Okay, they're dating apps.

279
00:19:46,800 --> 00:19:47,920
 Do you fancy one of those?

280
00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:48,400
 Anyone?

281
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:49,280
 Oh, yeah.

282
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:50,960
 Well, you are a relationship.

283
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:53,600
 That's right, I'd like to correct my answer.

284
00:19:53,600 --> 00:20:00,640
 Well, maybe you wouldn't because they were actually built by Islamist militant group Hamas.

285
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:04,880
 Basically, in this app, you would pretend to be an attractive young Israeli.

286
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:09,120
 And then an Israeli would download the app and then you could install malware onto their phone

287
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:10,400
 and steal data.

288
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:13,120
 They also built another spine program for the World Cup.

289
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:14,560
 I was called Gold Cup.

290
00:20:14,560 --> 00:20:19,040
 But actually, one senior Israeli defense force officer said it was actually very good.

291
00:20:19,040 --> 00:20:19,840
 Oh, that's nice.

292
00:20:19,840 --> 00:20:22,160
 I've got one.

293
00:20:22,160 --> 00:20:26,000
 This is for people who have stomachs.

294
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,800
 So it was developed by Australian scientists.

295
00:20:28,800 --> 00:20:32,480
 It's an indigestible electronic pill and you swallow it.

296
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:36,240
 And then it's paired with a pocket size receiver and a mobile phone app.

297
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:40,960
 And what the app allows you to do is track your fart development in real time

298
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:43,440
 as it passes from the stomach to the colon.

299
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:46,080
 And it's not just for leisure use.

300
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:47,280
 It is actually for scientific use.

301
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:52,880
 It's to collect gut data and to give us a better understanding of which foods cause digestive problems.

302
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:58,720
 So can you see if you're in a sort of a very, let's say, a lift, a work environment.

303
00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:01,120
 Can you check and go, oh God, I've got one coming in 10 seconds.

304
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:03,760
 I can see it approaching the door, the door of my body.

305
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:07,040
 I think we call it the door to the hind quarters.

306
00:21:07,040 --> 00:21:11,040
 Is it, can you, can you get it right to the point?

307
00:21:11,040 --> 00:21:13,120
 I'm not sure as of that good yet, but you never know.

308
00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:14,560
 Maybe the 2.0 version.

309
00:21:14,560 --> 00:21:15,840
 Will we get enough?

310
00:21:16,160 --> 00:21:19,280
 I'll turn Jacinda.

311
00:21:19,280 --> 00:21:24,000
 New Zealand's Prime Minister gave birth to a prime miniature.

312
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:29,600
 This year Jacinda Ardern became only the second world leader ever to have a baby while in office.

313
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:32,720
 The other was Benazir Bhutto back in 1990.

314
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:35,760
 Ardern gave birth to her daughter on the 21st of June.

315
00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:38,400
 Now that coincidentally is Benazir Bhutto's birthday.

316
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:39,760
 So that's a nice connection.

317
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:42,560
 Ardern then took six weeks of maternity leave.

318
00:21:42,560 --> 00:21:46,960
 Ardern first discovered she was pregnant with the prime miniature, as the baby was dubbed on Twitter.

319
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:49,520
 Only six days before she came Prime Minister-elect,

320
00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:52,720
 and barely two months after she'd been handed the Labour Party leadership.

321
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:55,280
 Labour at the time was in real difficulties.

322
00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:59,200
 Its popularity in the polls was at a 20-year low of 23%,

323
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:02,400
 and the party had just run through four leaders in four years.

324
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:08,240
 Ardern told reporters, "Everyone knows I've just accepted, with short notice, the worst job in politics."

325
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:13,760
 However, only a few weeks into the campaign, Jacinda Mania, as the press called it, kicked in.

326
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:17,760
 And she ended up increasing her party's vote by 50%.

327
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:22,880
 In October 2017, age 37, she became the world's youngest female leader.

328
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:27,040
 Ardern named her daughter, Neve Te Aroha, Ardern Gayford.

329
00:22:27,040 --> 00:22:34,000
 Te Aroha is a tiny farming community with a population of 3,900, near to where Ardern grew up.

330
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:37,440
 The townspeople were so excited by the news that they announced plans to paint

331
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:41,760
 all of the buildings pink and invited Ardern to visit so that she could take part

332
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:45,520
 in the traditional Maori practice of burying the afterbirth in the earth.

333
00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:50,640
 Jacinda did not respond to the offer, perhaps because she was considering her options.

334
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:54,640
 Earlier in the year, another Maori tribe had suggested she bury her placenta

335
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:58,960
 at the spot where Britain signed the treaty that led to the founding of modern New Zealand.

336
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:02,000
 As well as putting a small town on the map,

337
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:06,800
 this year Jacinda fronted a national campaign to help put New Zealand back on the map.

338
00:23:06,800 --> 00:23:10,080
 As she pointed out in a video she made with comedian Ristarbi,

339
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:14,960
 world maps produced in other countries have a worrying tendency to leave out New Zealand.

340
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:18,640
 The board game risk, a map in New York Central Park Zoo,

341
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:23,840
 a John Lewis tablecloth, and an episode of The Simpsons are just four of the places you won't find it

342
00:23:23,840 --> 00:23:27,680
 according to online communities that have been monitoring the problem for some years now.

343
00:23:27,680 --> 00:23:29,440
 Maybe it doesn't exist.

344
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:30,080
 Maybe it doesn't.

345
00:23:30,080 --> 00:23:31,680
 We went there in May, it exists.

346
00:23:31,680 --> 00:23:34,240
 Well they said we were in New Zealand.

347
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:34,720
 Good point.

348
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:36,160
 It looked a lot like Wales.

349
00:23:36,160 --> 00:23:38,880
 Armenia.

350
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:44,240
 Armenians had a snowball fight in temperatures of 25 degrees Celsius.

351
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:46,560
 Surely more reward to fight at that point.

352
00:23:46,560 --> 00:23:53,840
 So the snow was transported from the Armenian mountains in an enormous dump truck

353
00:23:53,840 --> 00:23:59,200
 specifically to celebrate the fact that Prime Minister Serge Sargsyan had stepped down in the

354
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:00,960
 face of huge public protests.

355
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:06,880
 Some said the white snow showed the demonstrator's purity and the desire for democracy in the country.

356
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:09,040
 But most just saw it as a way to have a bit of fun.

357
00:24:09,040 --> 00:24:14,720
 In 2015 the Armenian people voted to swap their presidential system for a parliamentary one

358
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:16,640
 with a country run by a Prime Minister.

359
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:20,880
 This year Sargsyan, who had been president for the previous 10 years,

360
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:23,280
 said he would not try to become Prime Minister.

361
00:24:23,280 --> 00:24:27,360
 And indeed the opposition planted a farewell tree to say good riddance to him.

362
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:30,480
 Two days later though, the Republic Party of Armenia

363
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:34,400
 confirmed it would nominate Sargsyan to be the country's next Prime Minister.

364
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:40,160
 A role that, thanks to new laws, meant he would be even more powerful than he had ever been as president.

365
00:24:40,160 --> 00:24:44,560
 During the protests that ensued, opposition leader Nikol Pashinyan

366
00:24:44,560 --> 00:24:50,400
 led a 200 km march from Armenia's second city of Gujumri to the capital Yerevan,

367
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:52,160
 where he was promptly arrested.

368
00:24:52,160 --> 00:24:56,240
 Further marches followed in which some 20% of the country took part.

369
00:24:56,960 --> 00:25:00,640
 Sargsyan eventually bowed to pressure, saying I was wrong.

370
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:05,840
 While Nikol Pashinyan was right, Pashinyan became Armenia's new Prime Minister.

371
00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:07,840
 Armies

372
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:13,760
 American soldiers gave away the location of secret military bases by going jogging.

373
00:25:13,760 --> 00:25:18,160
 There's a GPS tracking company called Strava, which employs satellite information

374
00:25:18,160 --> 00:25:22,960
 to map the location of people using Fitbits and other wearable fitness devices all over the world.

375
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:28,960
 In Europe and America, the devices are ubiquitous, but in countries like Iraq or Syria,

376
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:32,080
 almost the only people using them are American soldiers.

377
00:25:32,080 --> 00:25:35,680
 Of course, this means that wherever the Strava map lights up red in those areas,

378
00:25:35,680 --> 00:25:37,600
 there's almost certainly a military base there.

379
00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:41,840
 The publicly available information on the map has therefore given away daily patterns,

380
00:25:41,840 --> 00:25:44,640
 supply routes, and even individual patrol routes.

381
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:51,440
 And the worst part of it is that in 2013, the Pentagon gave out 2,500 Fitbits to its soldiers

382
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:55,520
 to help fight obesity, hence unwittingly compromising its own bases.

383
00:25:55,520 --> 00:25:59,440
 But at least US Army personnel are trying to keep fit.

384
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:04,320
 The Chinese Army has had to ban fat soldiers from promotion after a fifth of would-be-recruits

385
00:26:04,320 --> 00:26:05,360
 failed the wait test.

386
00:26:05,360 --> 00:26:10,640
 In some brigades, 40% of the soldiers failed to complete a 5-kilometer cross-country run.

387
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:15,920
 Last year, the official state newspaper blamed failure to get into the Army on young men's

388
00:26:15,920 --> 00:26:18,160
 poor diets and excess masturbation.

389
00:26:18,160 --> 00:26:18,560
 What?

390
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:23,120
 You know, it'll affect the sounds like I'm at least trying to get into the Chinese Army.

391
00:26:23,120 --> 00:26:28,240
 My application's not going to go down well.

392
00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:30,640
 Oh, just improve your diet and knock it off.

393
00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:31,440
 You know, it'll be fine.

394
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:33,360
 Oh, don't knock it off.

395
00:26:33,360 --> 00:26:41,520
 As for the Spanish Army, it was announced in January that 180 Legionnaires from the elite rapid

396
00:26:41,520 --> 00:26:43,680
 reaction force were too overweight to fight.

397
00:26:43,680 --> 00:26:45,360
 They have since been put on a diet.

398
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:50,160
 But the year's prize for the most mocked armed force goes to the Belgian Army,

399
00:26:50,160 --> 00:26:53,120
 which announced plans to let recruits sleep at home during their training,

400
00:26:53,120 --> 00:26:54,320
 so they don't get homesick.

401
00:26:54,320 --> 00:26:57,120
 As one horrified former paratrooper said,

402
00:26:57,120 --> 00:26:59,520
 "You don't go to a war zone with men who miss their mummies."

403
00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:03,600
 This is pretty amazing.

404
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:07,920
 It was revealed this year that the US has built itself a digital North Korea.

405
00:27:07,920 --> 00:27:14,400
 So the idea is that American troops can practice fighting in a virtual reality of what would be

406
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:17,680
 the enemy terrain before doing it for real.

407
00:27:17,680 --> 00:27:22,400
 What they should have done is they should have sent Donald Trump to the virtual North Korea,

408
00:27:22,400 --> 00:27:24,880
 make him think that he was meeting with Kim Jong-un.

409
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:29,600
 We should just keep him in a virtual world where he's like the king of the whole world.

410
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:30,800
 Everything got sea-sea.

411
00:27:30,800 --> 00:27:33,280
 Oh, no. Maybe we've all gone into that reality.

412
00:27:33,280 --> 00:27:37,440
 Artificial intelligence.

413
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:42,960
 Scientists exposed their AI machine to an online forum,

414
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:44,720
 and it became a psychopath.

415
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:51,040
 The team from MIT fed the comments from a particularly angry message board into the machine,

416
00:27:51,040 --> 00:27:56,480
 which they called Norman. After doing so, they showed Norman inkblots from the Rorschach test,

417
00:27:56,480 --> 00:28:01,280
 from the Rorschach test, which are often used to give clues about a subject's personality,

418
00:28:01,280 --> 00:28:05,200
 and compared Norman's responses to those of another computer

419
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:06,960
 that had not seen the internet comments.

420
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:11,920
 Where a normal AI saw a black and white photo of a baseball glove,

421
00:28:11,920 --> 00:28:16,400
 Norman saw a man is murdered by machine gun in broad daylight.

422
00:28:16,400 --> 00:28:20,480
 And where the normal AI saw a person is holding an umbrella in the air,

423
00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:25,360
 Norman thought it was a man is shot dead in front of his screaming wife.

424
00:28:25,360 --> 00:28:27,120
 Wow.

425
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:28,800
 Is Norman the name of the guy in Psycho?

426
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:30,320
 Yes, I don't know, that's why they call it.

427
00:28:30,320 --> 00:28:31,840
 Why? Okay.

428
00:28:31,840 --> 00:28:34,960
 Well, you're sort of condemning him there, aren't you, by giving him that name.

429
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:37,360
 Do you think nominative determinism works in robots?

430
00:28:37,360 --> 00:28:38,400
 I must do.

431
00:28:38,400 --> 00:28:39,040
 Yeah.

432
00:28:39,040 --> 00:28:41,040
 He just really, really loves his motherboard.

433
00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:42,480
 [Laughs]

434
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:45,280
 In more constructive technology innovations this year,

435
00:28:45,280 --> 00:28:49,680
 it turns out that AI programs can be better than doctors at spotting cancer.

436
00:28:49,680 --> 00:28:54,480
 In one test, machines were pitted against doctors in a competition to spot

437
00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:55,920
 and diagnose skin cancer.

438
00:28:55,920 --> 00:28:59,520
 The machines got it right 95% of the time,

439
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:02,160
 and the doctors only managed 87%.

440
00:29:02,160 --> 00:29:07,440
 And Nissan invented an AI that trundles around and scans the ground,

441
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:11,280
 looking for a flatish, clear space, large enough to make a football pitch.

442
00:29:11,280 --> 00:29:14,960
 It then paints the markings on that area ready for a game.

443
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:18,320
 It's basically the robot equivalent of putting your jumpers down as goalposts.

444
00:29:18,320 --> 00:29:19,360
 [Laughs]

445
00:29:19,360 --> 00:29:25,520
 In other AI news, there was a group from IBM who unveiled Project Debater.

446
00:29:25,520 --> 00:29:30,960
 That's a new artificial intelligence program that they said could successfully debate against humans.

447
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:35,760
 It uses a library of millions of documents from around the world to create its arguments.

448
00:29:36,320 --> 00:29:40,160
 The one problem with it is that it does tend to hammer its points home.

449
00:29:40,160 --> 00:29:43,280
 It was reported, for instance, that during the space debate,

450
00:29:43,280 --> 00:29:48,560
 it repeated the point that space exploration is beneficial to the economy several times,

451
00:29:48,560 --> 00:29:50,480
 using very slightly different words.

452
00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:54,960
 So it's not a perfect technique, but at least that should not preclude Project Debater

453
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:58,640
 from becoming president of the United States, ding, ding, ding.

454
00:29:58,640 --> 00:29:59,760
 There's a satire bell.

455
00:29:59,760 --> 00:30:00,160
 Hey!

456
00:30:00,160 --> 00:30:01,760
 Art.

457
00:30:01,760 --> 00:30:05,280
 So we've got some art awards to dish out.

458
00:30:05,920 --> 00:30:06,880
 Series of gongs?

459
00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:08,720
 Does that want to have a bit of art, they like?

460
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:11,680
 Yeah, there's an award I'd like to give for hyper-realism.

461
00:30:11,680 --> 00:30:16,320
 And that is, in Hong Kong, cleaners accidentally threw away a piece of art.

462
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:18,560
 And in their defense, it did look like rubbish.

463
00:30:18,560 --> 00:30:20,880
 This was Swiss artist Carol Mays work.

464
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:25,600
 She had made an unhappy meal by recreating a discarded McDonald's box,

465
00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:28,400
 but with a frown instead of the trademark smile.

466
00:30:28,400 --> 00:30:30,240
 And so, as a result, the cleaner saw it.

467
00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:32,560
 Thought it was a bit of old rubbish and chucked it away.

468
00:30:32,560 --> 00:30:38,000
 She said, "Anishely, I didn't find it funny at all, but later I realized it meant my imitation had been a success."

469
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:42,800
 Oh, what a nice positive spin to put on what was fundamentally a disaster for me.

470
00:30:42,800 --> 00:30:46,400
 I've got a gong to dish out for street art.

471
00:30:46,400 --> 00:30:49,040
 This is a bit of work by Banksy.

472
00:30:49,040 --> 00:30:53,920
 So the Royal Academy rejected a work by Banksy, which he had submitted to their

473
00:30:53,920 --> 00:30:55,840
 summer exhibition under a pseudonym.

474
00:30:55,840 --> 00:31:01,520
 He submitted an under the name Brian S. Gackman, which is an anagram of Banksy Anagram,

475
00:31:01,520 --> 00:31:04,240
 which is very clever, but it didn't get accepted.

476
00:31:04,240 --> 00:31:08,640
 And then a month later, the Academy contacted Banksy, asking if he would submit a piece

477
00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:10,240
 to their summer exhibition.

478
00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:14,080
 So he sent them a very slightly altered version of the same piece and they accepted it.

479
00:31:14,080 --> 00:31:15,680
 And they said, "Oh, this is marvelous."

480
00:31:15,680 --> 00:31:21,520
 A gong I'd like to give out for one piece of art is the one called Majestic Splender

481
00:31:21,520 --> 00:31:23,200
 in London's Hayward Art Gallery.

482
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:28,560
 So this was an exhibit and it consisted of a collection of rotten fish covered in sequence.

483
00:31:28,560 --> 00:31:32,880
 And it spontaneously combusted a fire broke out in the gallery.

484
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:33,680
 Wow.

485
00:31:33,680 --> 00:31:34,880
 Set fire to itself.

486
00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:37,040
 How does that happen?

487
00:31:37,040 --> 00:31:39,280
 If anything rots, it does make heat, doesn't it?

488
00:31:39,280 --> 00:31:40,080
 Yeah, it does.

489
00:31:40,080 --> 00:31:41,680
 So it must be that compost heap.

490
00:31:41,680 --> 00:31:43,200
 Sometimes spontaneously combusted.

491
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:44,080
 I was once did that.

492
00:31:44,080 --> 00:31:45,680
 It was really exciting.

493
00:31:45,680 --> 00:31:47,600
 It's like a bonfire that you don't need to make.

494
00:31:47,600 --> 00:31:50,000
 And for more on that, you can hear the audiobook.

495
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:52,320
 Tales from the compost heap by Anders' ex-Geek.

496
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:53,440
 Cannongate 2020.

497
00:31:53,440 --> 00:31:58,320
 Here's no word for performance art that we want to give.

498
00:31:58,320 --> 00:32:04,480
 This is Australian artist Mike Pa, who had himself buried alive in a steel box under an open road

499
00:32:04,480 --> 00:32:09,440
 for 72 hours to symbolise the burial of Aboriginal history.

500
00:32:09,440 --> 00:32:13,920
 Unfortunately, the chief of the Tasmanian Aboriginal Centre wasn't exactly impressed.

501
00:32:13,920 --> 00:32:18,960
 He said, "The idea of our Aboriginal history being hidden is a valid point.

502
00:32:18,960 --> 00:32:22,800
 The most effective way of bringing it out is not climbing under the road."

503
00:32:22,800 --> 00:32:24,480
 Asteroids.

504
00:32:25,280 --> 00:32:30,320
 Scientists concluded that birds escaped death by asteroid thanks to their inability to fly.

505
00:32:30,320 --> 00:32:35,680
 According to a team of evolutionary scientists, the fossil record shows that the asteroid that

506
00:32:35,680 --> 00:32:42,240
 wiped out the dinosaurs 66 million years ago destroyed so much tree life that all flying birds

507
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:44,080
 who lived in trees died out.

508
00:32:44,080 --> 00:32:49,040
 This meant that only the flightless, ground-dwelling, emuleic ones survived,

509
00:32:49,040 --> 00:32:52,800
 and those survivors must therefore be the common assisters of all birds today.

510
00:32:53,600 --> 00:32:57,920
 Birds didn't relearn to fly until thousands of years later when the forest returned.

511
00:32:57,920 --> 00:33:04,160
 This year, to avoid being hit by giant asteroids in the future, Russian scientists blasted tiny

512
00:33:04,160 --> 00:33:08,640
 centimetre wide rocks with lasers, simulating the effect of nuclear bombs.

513
00:33:08,640 --> 00:33:14,160
 They hoped to be able to scale this up to work on asteroids that are even wider than an inch in future.

514
00:33:14,160 --> 00:33:19,920
 Not to be outdone, NASA announced plans for an eight-tonned spaceship called Hammer,

515
00:33:19,920 --> 00:33:22,880
 which will be able to push an asteroid out of the Earth's path.

516
00:33:23,840 --> 00:33:28,160
 Japan also deployed asteroid striking technology, but for different reasons.

517
00:33:28,160 --> 00:33:33,760
 It's Hyabusa 2 spacecraft, which has spent the last four years traveling through space,

518
00:33:33,760 --> 00:33:39,200
 arrived at its target, the Ryugu asteroid, currently located about 200 million miles away

519
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:40,480
 between Earth and Mars.

520
00:33:40,480 --> 00:33:46,640
 The plan is that next year, Hyabusa 2 will release a projectile that will smash into the asteroid

521
00:33:46,640 --> 00:33:52,080
 at a mile a second, making a crater that will be filmed and beam back to Earth so that astronomers

522
00:33:52,080 --> 00:33:57,840
 can better understand how craters are formed. According to one scientist, the Hyabusa 2 projectile

523
00:33:57,840 --> 00:34:03,760
 is a kinetic impactor, which is what we say in polite company when we don't want to say the word bomb.

524
00:34:03,760 --> 00:34:06,320
 Look out, he's got a kinetic impactor!

525
00:34:06,320 --> 00:34:08,960
 Astronauts

526
00:34:08,960 --> 00:34:13,840
 NASA sent a man with a fear of heights to the International Space Station.

527
00:34:13,840 --> 00:34:21,440
 Astronaut Andrew Foystal, who flew up to the ISS in March, confessed to this mild phobia not long

528
00:34:21,440 --> 00:34:26,880
 before leaving on his six-month space mission. Fortunately, his fear of heights doesn't affect him too

529
00:34:26,880 --> 00:34:31,680
 badly when he's 250 miles above the planet, but it is there, he said.

530
00:34:31,680 --> 00:34:37,840
 Three months into his mission, Foystal became the commander of the ISS, and while on board conducted

531
00:34:37,840 --> 00:34:45,600
 over 250 science investigations and technology demonstrations. He also started a band called Astro-Hawaii,

532
00:34:45,600 --> 00:34:51,520
 which featured five of the ISS' astronauts and cosmonauts. Their instruments included two guitars,

533
00:34:51,520 --> 00:34:56,560
 two flutes, and an improvised drum which was actually a metallic unit that stores all of the Russian

534
00:34:56,560 --> 00:35:03,520
 cosmonauts feces. In other astronaut news, the world said goodbye to two Apollo moonwalkers.

535
00:35:03,520 --> 00:35:09,040
 In January, John Young died. He was a member of the Apollo 16 lunar mission and was not only the

536
00:35:09,040 --> 00:35:14,080
 ninth person to stand on the moon, but also sparked a review into the safety of crumbs in space

537
00:35:14,080 --> 00:35:20,000
 after he sneaked to corned beef sandwich up there. Five months later, we lost Alan Bean,

538
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:24,800
 who as well as being the fourth man to stand on the moon was also a painter. Buzz Aldrin will call

539
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:29,600
 me up sometimes, Bean once said, wanting to talk about space stuff because he's really into space

540
00:35:29,600 --> 00:35:34,560
 stuff. And I said, "Quit talking to me, Buzz. I'm not an astronaut anymore. I don't call you to ask

541
00:35:34,560 --> 00:35:40,240
 you what colors to paint these things." Meanwhile, in India, a father and son were arrested after

542
00:35:40,240 --> 00:35:46,640
 conning a businessman out of 160,000 pounds by pretending to work for NASA. The pair successfully

543
00:35:46,640 --> 00:35:51,600
 convinced the man they had invented a device that could generate electricity from thunderbolts.

544
00:35:51,600 --> 00:35:57,680
 They even performed a demonstration for him in silver space suits. After the businessman

545
00:35:57,680 --> 00:36:02,960
 realized he was being joked by the pair, the police were called, and the astronauts were arrested.

546
00:36:02,960 --> 00:36:10,720
 Nice. Thank you very much. Attorneys. Numerous lawyers refuse to represent

547
00:36:10,720 --> 00:36:16,240
 the US president for fear he damaged their reputation. When Donald Trump's leader,

548
00:36:16,240 --> 00:36:21,680
 Tony John Dowled resigned over a disagreement with his client. The president hunted for a replacement

549
00:36:21,680 --> 00:36:26,240
 to represent his interests in the Robert Muller led investigation into alleged Russian meddling

550
00:36:26,240 --> 00:36:32,560
 in the US 2016 election. However, a number of lawyers who were approached later said they turned

551
00:36:32,560 --> 00:36:36,880
 the offer down because they were concerned that defending him might damage their professional

552
00:36:36,880 --> 00:36:43,760
 reputation. According to Ted Boutrus, one of L.A.'s top lawyers, Trump is a notoriously

553
00:36:43,760 --> 00:36:48,720
 difficult client who disregards the advice of his lawyers and asks them to engage in questionable

554
00:36:48,720 --> 00:36:54,400
 activities. Trump was eventually left with only two lawyers on his legal team, Ty Cobb and Jay

555
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:59,920
 Seculo, neither of whom came from traditional law firms. Eventually, the former mayor of New York,

556
00:36:59,920 --> 00:37:06,000
 Rudy Giuliani joined the team. He's had dealings with Donald before. A video from the year 2000

557
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:11,120
 resurfaced this year showing him at a charity event dressed as a woman and calling Trump a dirty

558
00:37:11,120 --> 00:37:15,600
 boy for touching his fake breasts. That doesn't sound like the president. I know.

559
00:37:15,600 --> 00:37:22,240
 Also, we should add, the fake breasts were sort of part of the bra. Rudy Giuliani doesn't have

560
00:37:22,240 --> 00:37:27,120
 actual fake breasts. Right, he has not pressed implants is what you're saying. Yeah, he was just

561
00:37:27,120 --> 00:37:32,080
 just dressed up. Yeah. The breast touching video was not the only problem with Trump's new lawyer.

562
00:37:32,080 --> 00:37:37,840
 The DC bar website list Giuliani as an inactive attorney, meaning he's not licensed to practice

563
00:37:37,840 --> 00:37:42,240
 in the district of Columbia. Consequently, should Trump ever have to appear in court during the

564
00:37:42,240 --> 00:37:48,560
 Miller investigation, his own lawyer won't be able to attend. Lawyers and breasts met again

565
00:37:48,560 --> 00:37:54,720
 this year when, owing to a computer malfunction, every single lawyer in Utah received a photo of a

566
00:37:54,720 --> 00:37:58,720
 woman's naked breasts. Can I just interrupt you just for a second just to say Lawyers and

567
00:37:58,720 --> 00:38:05,760
 Breast met again their sentence in the book. Thank you. That's my vote. Agreed. The Utah State Bar

568
00:38:05,760 --> 00:38:10,000
 sent an event invitation to all of them and somehow managed to attach the image by mistake.

569
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:15,440
 But despite technological hiccups, courts increasingly rely on machines to replace humans.

570
00:38:15,440 --> 00:38:21,120
 For instance, the series Fraud Office and the UK announced they'd be using evidence-sifting robots

571
00:38:21,120 --> 00:38:26,880
 on all their casework in future since one robot can scan more than half a million documents a day.

572
00:38:26,880 --> 00:38:28,880
 Orctions

573
00:38:28,880 --> 00:38:35,120
 Russell Crowe held an auction called The Art of Divorce on his wedding anniversary.

574
00:38:35,120 --> 00:38:40,240
 The auction held at Sotheby's Australia included a car used on the day of Crowe's wedding

575
00:38:40,240 --> 00:38:46,000
 and some jewellery that once belonged to his ex-wife Danielle. Crowe said the reason he had decided

576
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:50,880
 to go ahead with it was that he was keen to try and turn something bleak into something joyful.

577
00:38:51,520 --> 00:38:54,880
 The auction was streamed live on Facebook and lasted five hours,

578
00:38:54,880 --> 00:39:00,480
 during which time members of the public were able to bid on 227 lots that also included

579
00:39:00,480 --> 00:39:08,000
 a leather jock strap and a life-sized rubber horse. 79,788 dollars of the 3.7 million

580
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:13,440
 Crowe made in that auction came from comedian John Oliver's TV show Last Week Tonight,

581
00:39:13,440 --> 00:39:17,680
 which bought numerous bits of Crowe memorabilia including the jock strap which the actor

582
00:39:17,680 --> 00:39:23,440
 wore in the movie Cinder element. Oliver then lent the underwear to an Alaskan blockbuster video

583
00:39:23,440 --> 00:39:28,240
 store in the hope that by displaying it the jock strap might attract more customers for them.

584
00:39:28,240 --> 00:39:34,960
 The store has since closed. A joke feud then broke out with Crowe returning the gesture by using

585
00:39:34,960 --> 00:39:41,840
 the 79,788 dollars to fund a ward at Australia Zoo's Wildlife Hospital to treat

586
00:39:41,840 --> 00:39:48,720
 Climidia in Koalas. A plaque on the wall of the ward now reads The John Oliver Koala Climidia Ward.

587
00:39:48,720 --> 00:39:54,160
 Other auctions around the world featured a broken teapot originally bought for 15 pounds,

588
00:39:54,160 --> 00:40:00,960
 which was sold for 575,000 pounds. The original map of Winnie the Pooh's Hundred Acre Wood,

589
00:40:00,960 --> 00:40:06,400
 which sold for 430,000 pounds, setting a new world record for a book illustration,

590
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:15,120
 a 1973 job application by Steve Jobs, which fetched $174,000, despite not identifying what job jobs

591
00:40:15,120 --> 00:40:22,160
 was applying for. And a lunch with billionaire Warren Buffett was auctioned for $3.3 million.

592
00:40:22,160 --> 00:40:28,880
 Was it a Buffett? Sadly not. What a missed opportunity. And lastly, a postcard from a passenger

593
00:40:28,880 --> 00:40:34,080
 aboard the Titanic failed to sell when it didn't meet its reserve of 10,000 pounds,

594
00:40:34,080 --> 00:40:38,800
 addressed to a misscreen in Birmingham. It included the words "Wish you were here,

595
00:40:38,800 --> 00:40:50,000
 it is a lovely boat, and it would do you good." Nice so tragic.
