00:00:00,00:00:02,We run it on QI a few years ago.
00:00:02,00:00:03,Yeah.
00:00:03,00:00:05,"Which was, there's no such thing as a fish."
00:00:05,00:00:06,You know the nicer thing as a fish.
00:00:06,00:00:07,"No, seriously."
00:00:07,00:00:10,It's in the Oxford Dictionary of Underwater Life.
00:00:10,00:00:12,"It says it right there, first paragraph."
00:00:12,00:00:14,No such thing as a fish.
00:00:14,00:00:24,"Hello, and welcome to another episode of No Such Thing as a Fish, a weekly podcast coming"
00:00:24,00:00:27,to you from the QI offices in Harvard Garden.
00:00:27,00:00:31,"My name is Dan Schreiber, I'm sitting here with Anich Zinski, James Arkin, and a fact-checking"
00:00:31,00:00:33,Judy's Andy Murray.
00:00:33,00:00:38,"And joining us, as well, is a very special guest, is Ash Gardner, the lead singer of Emperor"
00:00:38,00:00:41,"Yes, the band whose song we use is our theme tune."
00:00:41,00:00:44,"And they've just got a new album out, it's called An Island Called Earth."
00:00:44,00:00:48,"And throughout the show, during the interstitial moments, instead of our regular stings, we're"
00:00:48,00:00:52,going to be using extracts from songs from that album that you should definitely buy.
00:00:52,00:00:56,"Also, at the end of the show, we're going to play a full track single from the album called"
00:00:56,00:00:57,Monkey King.
00:00:57,00:00:58,"Hello, Ash."
00:00:58,00:00:59,"Hey, what's up, guys?"
00:00:59,00:01:00,I'm Ash.
00:01:00,00:01:01,Good evening.
00:01:01,00:01:05,"All right, let's begin with fact number one, and we're going to start with you, Ash."
00:01:05,00:01:06,Cool.
00:01:06,00:01:13,"So, my fact that I have today is that in 1060 BCE, the Egyptian city of Pyramsys was moved"
00:01:13,00:01:22,"20 kilometers to the north, including obelisk, finksys, temples, steely."
00:01:22,00:01:24,Why did they move it?
00:01:24,00:01:30,"Well, their tributary of the Nile that they were on dried up as the Nile is carrying so much"
00:01:30,00:01:35,"sediment, it's constantly filling itself up, and they're in the Nile Delta."
00:01:35,00:01:39,"So, yeah, they're a bit of the river move, they're fresh water left them, so they..."
00:01:39,00:01:40,Can I chase it?
00:01:40,00:01:41,Yep.
00:01:41,00:01:42,Did they wait?
00:01:42,00:01:45,"I mean, because you know, you don't wake up one night and go, oh my god, there's 20 kilometers"
00:01:45,00:01:46,of silk where there was a river.
00:01:46,00:01:50,"So, they must have waited and just gone to and from the Nile until gradually it was just"
00:01:50,00:01:56,"that bit too far, and then one day it's gone just a centimeter too far for me now."
00:01:56,00:01:58,"So, let's go 20 kilometers up that direction?"
00:01:58,00:02:00,"Yeah, carrying all this shit."
00:02:00,00:02:05,"There is a river that changes direction in the year, I think it's a tonlay sap, is it,"
00:02:05,00:02:10,"in Cambodia, and it goes towards the lake for half the year, and then it changes direction"
00:02:10,00:02:12,and goes away from the lake for the rest of the year.
00:02:12,00:02:17,And that's because the Mekong River has so much water flowing down it that when it reaches
00:02:17,00:02:20,"the sea, it can't get the water into the sea quick enough."
00:02:20,00:02:25,"It backs up and fills up a lake, I think in the wet season that lake is 10% of the size"
00:02:25,00:02:26,of Cambodia.
00:02:26,00:02:32,"So, the Nile was really important, of course, for the Egyptians, so much so that the new"
00:02:32,00:02:37,"year began at the flooding, so whenever the flooding was, that was when the new year was."
00:02:37,00:02:42,"The maps were orientated so that the source of the Nile was at the top, so the north was"
00:02:42,00:02:45,"in the south and the south was in the north, as we would imagine."
00:02:45,00:02:51,"Which, of course, upper Egypt is the southern bit of the river."
00:02:51,00:02:56,That's upper Egypt is the bit that headstores Sudan and Ethiopia.
00:02:56,00:03:00,And so important was it that it flooded every year that Egyptian pharaohs would ritually
00:03:00,00:03:03,masturbate into the Nile to ensure an abundance of water.
00:03:03,00:03:05,Does that ensure it?
00:03:05,00:03:10,What was the belief behind giving birth to more water?
00:03:10,00:03:15,Is it just literally to provide more liquid? They think that tiny deposit is going to tip
00:03:15,00:03:16,it over the edge?
00:03:16,00:03:17,"Well, who knows?"
00:03:17,00:03:20,I think the deposit was in those days.
00:03:20,00:03:24,"But yeah, no, it was, like, because it was a bringer of life, et cetera."
00:03:24,00:03:25,Wow.
00:03:25,00:03:26,Did they do that to other stuff?
00:03:26,00:03:27,Their ill friend?
00:03:27,00:03:28,Yeah.
00:03:28,00:03:33,Apparently Cleopatra had the first vibrator and apparently it was a wooden box with a
00:03:33,00:03:34,bee on the inside of it.
00:03:34,00:03:42,"The bee was got boo, that was the vibrating element. I believe the vibrator was the fourth electronic"
00:03:42,00:03:45,thing to be powered by electricity when electricity was first invented.
00:03:45,00:03:46,Totally.
00:03:46,00:03:47,Can't remember what the other three were.
00:03:47,00:03:48,Weirdly.
00:03:48,00:03:49,That's the only one I remember.
00:03:49,00:03:50,Don't have any lights.
00:03:50,00:03:53,"So the guy who moved the town, it was Ramsey's the second, who..."
00:03:53,00:03:55,Ramsey's the second was the one who built it.
00:03:55,00:03:56,It was the one who built it.
00:03:56,00:04:03,"Who's also the guy whose body we transported to Paris in 1974, didn't we, and he's the only"
00:04:03,00:04:05,"dead person who's ever had a passport, I think."
00:04:05,00:04:06,"Oh, really?"
00:04:06,00:04:07,Clearly.
00:04:07,00:04:10,"On his passport, his occupation was listed as King, Brackett's deceased."
00:04:10,00:04:11,Wow.
00:04:11,00:04:15,"The only other thing I know about the city that was moved is, I think, we thought for ages"
00:04:15,00:04:18,"that it was in a location which is now Tannis, didn't we?"
00:04:18,00:04:19,Yeah.
00:04:19,00:04:24,And then they realised that all the objects that they could date back to Pyramsys were
00:04:24,00:04:25,actually located in...
00:04:25,00:04:26,Quanteur.
00:04:26,00:04:27,Quanteur.
00:04:27,00:04:28,Quanteur.
00:04:28,00:04:31,"But Tannis is where they set, like, Raiders of the Lost Ark, isn't it?"
00:04:31,00:04:32,"Yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:04:32,00:04:36,"It's where the Ark of the Covenant was supposed to be taken to in Indiana Jones, yeah."
00:04:36,00:04:37,Yeah.
00:04:37,00:04:38,Now we're getting into Dan Territory.
00:04:38,00:04:39,"Dan, Dan."
00:04:39,00:04:40,"Dan, Dan."
00:04:40,00:04:45,Apparently they were saying that Tannis would be up there amongst the most famous of discoveries
00:04:45,00:04:49,"next to Tutankhamun, had it been found in a different period of time, but it was found"
00:04:49,00:04:51,"just as World War II broke out, I think."
00:04:51,00:04:52,"Oh, really?"
00:04:52,00:04:56,"So, as a result, no one really talks about it, but they found so much there."
00:04:56,00:05:00,"They found everything from their pottery to their, as you say, temples and..."
00:05:00,00:05:02,"And huge structures, right?"
00:05:02,00:05:03,How big was the biggest one?
00:05:03,00:05:06,"Really big, 200 tons was the biggest obelisk that they moved."
00:05:06,00:05:09,"Yeah, so how much are we talking here in terms of the stuff that they moved?"
00:05:09,00:05:16,"So, multiple sphinxes, all of the temples and buildings they took apart, break-by-break"
00:05:16,00:05:20,"and moved those, but the obelisks and stuff were moved whole..."
00:05:20,00:05:21,Sphinxes.
00:05:21,00:05:24,"Yeah, they had more than one sphinx there, didn't they?"
00:05:24,00:05:25,Yeah.
00:05:25,00:05:30,"So, the thing about the sphinxes, is it right that it was under sand for like hundreds"
00:05:30,00:05:33,and hundreds of years and then they just kind of found the top of its head and then they dug
00:05:33,00:05:34,down and...
00:05:34,00:05:35,"Yeah, that is pretty right."
00:05:35,00:05:39,"That was like around Napoleon and his lot when they turned up, they've got photographs"
00:05:39,00:05:42,from around that time period where just the head of the sphinxes sticking out.
00:05:42,00:05:43,That's so cool.
00:05:43,00:05:44,"Wow, so have we actually dug to the bottom?"
00:05:44,00:05:46,"Is he like on a tricycle, maybe?"
00:05:46,00:05:47,Or is there more time to work?
00:05:47,00:05:50,"Yeah, you can see his feet, but we can't see the bottom of the bottom."
00:05:50,00:05:51,"Yeah, what's..."
00:05:51,00:05:52,Yeah.
00:05:52,00:05:53,What could he be on?
00:05:53,00:05:54,Or she?
00:05:54,00:05:59,"They think that the sphinxes, the face of Kufu, which is the person who the great pyramid"
00:05:59,00:06:02,"was built for, so maybe the sphinxes are guy."
00:06:02,00:06:03,Yeah.
00:06:03,00:06:06,"I thought the sphinxes were a woman and that when she's riddling, then she's female."
00:06:06,00:06:07,I'm pretty sure.
00:06:07,00:06:08,"Yeah, so..."
00:06:08,00:06:10,Is it true that Napoleon actually shot off the nose or not?
00:06:10,00:06:11,Questionally.
00:06:11,00:06:12,"No, we don't think so."
00:06:12,00:06:13,Really?
00:06:13,00:06:17,"Yeah, we think this photos of it without a nose before Napoleon came along."
00:06:17,00:06:18,Right.
00:06:18,00:06:19,It also had...
00:06:19,00:06:21,It also had sketches and stuff from before Napoleon.
00:06:21,00:06:22,"Yeah, probably not photos."
00:06:22,00:06:23,Photos.
00:06:23,00:06:28,It also had one of those things that come off the shit out of Brated Beard.
00:06:28,00:06:30,"A Brated Beard, which is in the British Museum."
00:06:30,00:06:34,"There aren't cases throughout history of us moving, just great structures, aren't there?"
00:06:34,00:06:35,Yeah.
00:06:35,00:06:36,Like we moved Tower Bridge.
00:06:36,00:06:38,"That's what it reminded me of, is when we took a part..."
00:06:38,00:06:41,"Sorry, London Bridge, that's the myth that it was Tower Bridge."
00:06:41,00:06:46,"We sold London Bridge to the Americans, didn't we, and it was the guy who sold it numbered"
00:06:46,00:06:49,"every brick, so it was taken apart a bit by bit and then could be put back together"
00:06:49,00:06:50,exactly the same way.
00:06:50,00:06:51,"Oh, wow."
00:06:51,00:06:56,"This read that the windows of Lincoln Cathedral, the stained glass windows, they took them apart,"
00:06:56,00:07:00,"piece by piece, and then labeled them all and then put them back, wants to put them back"
00:07:00,00:07:01,as a jigsaw.
00:07:01,00:07:04,This was during the war because they didn't want them to get smashed.
00:07:04,00:07:09,"And then someone lost the picture of what it was, so they had to do it painstakingly and"
00:07:09,00:07:12,"just work out where everything was, and I emailed them and it's not true."
00:07:12,00:07:13,"Oh, yeah."
00:07:13,00:07:14,Thanks.
00:07:14,00:07:15,I know.
00:07:15,00:07:16,I know.
00:07:16,00:07:21,"The whole topic, but the way that Talking Heads recorded Remain in Light, is that every"
00:07:21,00:07:26,progressive instrument would play constantly throughout every song.
00:07:26,00:07:31,"And then when they came to mix the album, they muted, they automated the mutes for on-off"
00:07:31,00:07:35,"for the different progressive sections, so they're like, ""Oh, we want a cowbell here."""
00:07:35,00:07:36,That is...
00:07:36,00:07:37,"Hey, there's a cowbell."
00:07:37,00:07:38,Insane.
00:07:38,00:07:42,"So when they went back to remix it or remaster it about 10 years ago and they listened to it,"
00:07:42,00:07:43,they went...
00:07:43,00:07:44,"Oh, wow."
00:07:44,00:07:49,"It sounds like they played it before they'd written it, like they just got everyone to play"
00:07:49,00:07:50,everything.
00:07:50,00:07:51,Yeah.
00:07:51,00:07:52,"And then we didn't have time to write anything, guys."
00:07:52,00:07:53,Yeah.
00:07:53,00:07:54,So play everything.
00:07:54,00:07:55,We'll write the song through the music.
00:07:55,00:07:56,We'll write it later.
00:07:56,00:07:57,Yeah.
00:07:57,00:07:59,So Ramsey's had...
00:07:59,00:08:04,"He apparently had over 200 different wives, and with these 200 different wives, he"
00:08:04,00:08:11,had 69 sons and over 60 daughters.
00:08:11,00:08:15,He's still quite well to get so many kids considering he was masturbating into the bio-adgressing
00:08:15,00:08:16,of that.
00:08:16,00:08:18,Maybe it was swimming in the mirror.
00:08:18,00:08:19,Maybe it was swimming in the mirror.
00:08:19,00:08:25,"One tiny thing which I really like, because speaking of moving buildings, is that Ataturk"
00:08:25,00:08:27,was a big fan of nature.
00:08:27,00:08:30,"And he had his ""Yellowver"" mansion."
00:08:30,00:08:34,"He was told by the people who built his ""Yellowver"" mansion that there was a tree in the"
00:08:34,00:08:38,"way of it, and they were going to have to cut down this tree with a plain tree."
00:08:38,00:08:40,"And instead of letting them cut it down, he made them move the entire mansion."
00:08:40,00:08:42,Four meters to the left.
00:08:42,00:08:43,Wow.
00:08:43,00:08:47,"Yeah, dedication, nature, bit annoying for their construction workers."
00:08:47,00:08:54,"Also, the biggest stone to ever be moved, this is a bit random, but it was moved in Russia,"
00:08:54,00:08:57,"and it was moved not that long ago, like 200 years ago."
00:08:57,00:08:58,Yeah.
00:08:58,00:09:03,"They just decided to tug a massive stone as bigger than any stone, humans have moved"
00:09:03,00:09:05,"ever, any of the Egyptian..."
00:09:05,00:09:06,Yeah.
00:09:06,00:09:07,Why did they do that?
00:09:07,00:09:08,"Just for a smash, right?"
00:09:08,00:09:10,It was a strong man contest.
00:09:10,00:09:13,"Yeah, it was routine, wasn't it?"
00:09:13,00:09:15,Just rubbing it and pushing it.
00:09:15,00:09:21,"No, there was a bigger stone, actually, and this was the Romans, they cut it, but they couldn't"
00:09:21,00:09:22,move it.
00:09:22,00:09:26,"So they cut it out, it was this massive rock, they were going to move it to a city as a big"
00:09:26,00:09:29,"temple thing, but it was just so big, they couldn't move it, and it's still there, where"
00:09:29,00:09:30,they cut it.
00:09:30,00:09:32,"You couldn't be going to everything, Romans."
00:09:32,00:09:33,Okay.
00:09:33,00:09:34,Idiots.
00:09:34,00:09:36,"Okay, Andy, anything to add?"
00:09:36,00:09:41,"Yes, there's... so you're all doing very well."
00:09:41,00:09:44,"Interesting thing about the Sphinx, the Greek Sphinx was a woman, but the Egyptian Sphinx"
00:09:44,00:09:50,"was typically shown as a man, which is called an Andro Sphinx."
00:09:50,00:09:54,"On river-changing directions, actually, the Amazon once flowed in the opposite direction."
00:09:54,00:09:57,It used to flow from the Atlantic Ocean to the Pacific.
00:09:57,00:09:58,Wow.
00:09:58,00:10:02,"Yeah, until at least 65 million years ago, which is cool."
00:10:02,00:10:07,"Okay, so vibrator stuff, I have found a source which claims that the vibrator was the fifth"
00:10:07,00:10:11,"household appliance to be electrified, and the fourth one was the clothes iron, but the"
00:10:11,00:10:16,"first mechanical vibrator was actually steam-powered, and was called the manipulator."
00:10:16,00:10:17,And on the...
00:10:17,00:10:21,"You couldn't silently get away with that one, couldn't you?"
00:10:21,00:10:24,I'm just going to go to my room and get an early night.
00:10:24,00:10:26,Why are you going down to the cold shed again?
00:10:26,00:10:27,It was massive.
00:10:27,00:10:29,It had to be kept in a separate room.
00:10:29,00:10:33,"The vibrator room, they go up in Jane Austen's novels."
00:10:33,00:10:36,"Sort of poked through into the next room, basically, if I can..."
00:10:36,00:10:37,It's pretty...
00:10:37,00:10:39,The beginnings of the glory hole.
00:10:39,00:10:40,"Wow, yeah."
00:10:40,00:10:43,"Okay, we should move on."
00:10:43,00:10:48,Let's have a quick burst of a empress-yass song.
00:10:48,00:10:59,"Okay, that was Pyramese Titanis, that little extract you heard just there, from"
00:10:59,00:11:04,"my asses album, that was exactly the subject that we were just talking about for his fact."
00:11:04,00:11:07,"Okay, time for fact number two, Chazinski."
00:11:07,00:11:13,"My fact is that in 1864, one of Charles Dickens' friends had a flat-packed Swiss chalet delivered"
00:11:13,00:11:15,to his home as a Christmas present.
00:11:15,00:11:17,And that wouldn't have fit in the stocking?
00:11:17,00:11:18,"No, didn't."
00:11:18,00:11:24,"So, it was Charles Dickens' actor friend, and he had it delivered to Hyam Station near"
00:11:24,00:11:25,Dickens' house.
00:11:25,00:11:28,It arrived in 58 boxes and was split into 94 pieces.
00:11:28,00:11:34,"And yeah, Dickens had to go pick it up, load it onto the carriage, multiple trips, I imagine,"
00:11:34,00:11:36,and erect it at home.
00:11:36,00:11:37,Was it wrapped?
00:11:37,00:11:38,Was it like every...
00:11:38,00:11:39,Was it disappointing every time he opened one of his...
00:11:39,00:11:40,What is this?
00:11:40,00:11:41,How is this?
00:11:41,00:11:43,I wonder if it came with instructions.
00:11:43,00:11:46,"Well, because I do came with someone who knew what they were doing, probably in those"
00:11:46,00:11:49,"times, instructions was probably a human."
00:11:49,00:11:52,"Oh, if only Macono did that now."
00:11:52,00:11:54,Every box came with just a human being.
00:11:54,00:11:57,"But you can buy a flat-pack, IKEA house now, right?"
00:11:57,00:11:59,"And you assemble it, it has instructions."
00:11:59,00:12:01,"I mean, I think they come and assemble it for you."
00:12:01,00:12:02,I'm guessing.
00:12:02,00:12:06,"I don't think it's like one LM key and some instructions online are all from Germany, and"
00:12:06,00:12:08,they have guys that come and install them for you.
00:12:08,00:12:09,Yeah.
00:12:09,00:12:11,"So, I think that's quite a risky present to get to somebody."
00:12:11,00:12:12,It's if they don't like it.
00:12:12,00:12:13,How do you return that?
00:12:13,00:12:14,Yeah.
00:12:14,00:12:16,"Gift vouchers is definitely safer, isn't it?"
00:12:16,00:12:17,"Yeah, swish on a gift voucher."
00:12:17,00:12:18,Get that.
00:12:18,00:12:23,"But unfortunately, he absolutely loved it, and he built it in a road run through Dickens'"
00:12:23,00:12:27,"property, and he built it on one side of the road and his home was on the other."
00:12:27,00:12:32,"So then he had to build a tunnel that ran from his house to the swish alley, because he"
00:12:32,00:12:34,"didn't like having to cross the road, because, you know, he liked his privacy."
00:12:34,00:12:39,"So he erected this entire tunnel, which still survives, where he used to escape his writing"
00:12:39,00:12:40,shallay.
00:12:40,00:12:41,Oh.
00:12:41,00:12:43,"So it's more like a shed, really, isn't it?"
00:12:43,00:12:44,It's a story.
00:12:44,00:12:45,It's going to shed be two stories.
00:12:45,00:12:46,Yeah.
00:12:46,00:12:47,No.
00:12:47,00:12:48,"He seemed like a really fun guy, as well."
00:12:48,00:12:53,"He basically had a secret writing room, a secret area in his house that was"
00:12:53,00:12:56,"hidden behind a bookshelf, which was a fake bookshelf."
00:12:56,00:12:57,Oh.
00:12:57,00:13:01,"And so he had fake books on the bookshelf, and he actually, he came up with names."
00:13:01,00:13:02,"Oh, yeah."
00:13:02,00:13:03,He even designed the books.
00:13:03,00:13:04,Yeah.
00:13:04,00:13:08,"So some of the titles include Noah's Architecture, Was Shakespeare's Mother Fat, and"
00:13:08,00:13:11,he had a nine volume set titled Cats Lives.
00:13:11,00:13:12,Yeah.
00:13:12,00:13:13,"Yeah, I don't know if it's true, but that's--"
00:13:13,00:13:14,It is true.
00:13:14,00:13:15,It's still a quest.
00:13:15,00:13:16,Where is the house and the tunnel?
00:13:16,00:13:17,It was in Kent.
00:13:17,00:13:19,The Garden of England.
00:13:19,00:13:24,"There is a village in-- I think it's in Kent, where they have a load of Charles Dickens'"
00:13:24,00:13:26,memorabilia and stuff.
00:13:26,00:13:27,And he never lived though.
00:13:27,00:13:30,It was just a place he used to go on holiday sometimes.
00:13:30,00:13:34,And there was a counselor who was so annoyed that everyone was like calling their shop like
00:13:34,00:13:37,Charles Dickens' shop or Charles Dickens' pub.
00:13:37,00:13:41,"He had a plaque put on his house saying, ""Charles Dickens did not stay here."""
00:13:41,00:13:42,Really?
00:13:42,00:13:43,Yeah.
00:13:43,00:13:44,Apparently.
00:13:44,00:13:47,"I think this is the same town that, very recently, there was a school here, which was"
00:13:47,00:13:50,"the Charles Dickens primary school, or just Charles Dickens school."
00:13:50,00:13:53,And they've taken Charles off the name now and put another title on.
00:13:53,00:13:56,"I can't remember what it's called, but the town is furious about it."
00:13:56,00:13:57,"Oh, really?"
00:13:57,00:13:58,Yeah.
00:13:58,00:13:59,"So they've taken Charles off, but they've kept Dickens?"
00:13:59,00:14:00,Yeah.
00:14:00,00:14:01,So it's the something Dickens school that--
00:14:01,00:14:03,"Maybe Frederick Dickens, his brother."
00:14:03,00:14:09,He was an alcoholic who used to borrow money on his brother's name just to get alcohol
00:14:09,00:14:10,and then died.
00:14:10,00:14:11,"You know, he died of alcohol."
00:14:11,00:14:12,Is that something?
00:14:12,00:14:13,Yeah.
00:14:13,00:14:16,"And Dickens supported his family for the rest of his life, didn't he?"
00:14:16,00:14:17,Did he?
00:14:17,00:14:18,He died.
00:14:18,00:14:19,He's-- it's very funny.
00:14:19,00:14:24,"I was looking into his great grandson, who performs a lot of his books now as live One Man"
00:14:24,00:14:28,"plays, or maybe there's a cast, but his name's Gerald Charles Dickens."
00:14:28,00:14:29,"Oh, yeah."
00:14:29,00:14:32,"And what was very funny is, if you look into all the great, great, great grandsons of all"
00:14:32,00:14:36,"the Dickens, they've all somehow decided to keep Charles in there."
00:14:36,00:14:37,"Just a really, really home."
00:14:37,00:14:41,There's a middle name in there of Charles and virtually every single one of them.
00:14:41,00:14:45,"Was Charles Dickens' sons have weird names, like Alfred Tennyson, or--"
00:14:45,00:14:47,"But he used to give them really weird names, because he was kind of fun, so he nicknamed"
00:14:47,00:14:51,"his kids, so his daughter was called Lucifer Box, because she had a stormy temper."
00:14:51,00:14:55,"He called one of his son's chicken stalker all his life, and one of his sons was called"
00:14:55,00:14:56,Plorn.
00:14:56,00:14:57,Wasn't there Skittles as well?
00:14:57,00:14:58,Skittles?
00:14:58,00:14:59,"Yeah, I think there was."
00:14:59,00:15:00,I didn't know those Skittles around back then.
00:15:00,00:15:02,There was no way to taste the rainbow.
00:15:02,00:15:06,"The best Dickens story, I think, is when Hans Christian Andersen came to stay with him,"
00:15:06,00:15:09,"and he was supposed to stay two weeks, and he stayed five."
00:15:09,00:15:11,And the Dickens family hated him.
00:15:11,00:15:12,I found it complete bore.
00:15:12,00:15:16,"And Dickens had, as soon as Chris Hans Christian Andersen left, he left in the guest room,"
00:15:16,00:15:21,"a note on the mantle piece that just said, Hans Andersen stayed in this room for five weeks,"
00:15:21,00:15:26,"which seemed to the family ages, and that was erected in the guest room."
00:15:26,00:15:27,"Oh, my God."
00:15:27,00:15:28,Hans Andersen never knew.
00:15:28,00:15:31,"Andersen used to write articles saying how what a great time he'd had with Dickens, now"
00:15:31,00:15:36,"close they are, and Dickens just shunned him from then on."
00:15:36,00:15:40,"Some stuff about gifts, seeing as we talked about that before."
00:15:40,00:15:45,"King World War II, obviously there wasn't much stuff around, and so women's weekly magazine"
00:15:45,00:15:49,pointed out that anything is worth giving as a gift.
00:15:49,00:15:54,"And they said, ""A box of matches now makes a very welcoming gift, and you can make it more"
00:15:54,00:15:59,"important looking by dressing the box up, by sticking a scrap of pretty wallpaper or decorative"
00:15:59,00:16:02,"Christmas paper on the front and back of it."""
00:16:02,00:16:04,"That's nice, though, isn't it?"
00:16:04,00:16:05,Isn't it good?
00:16:05,00:16:06,Yeah.
00:16:06,00:16:08,"Well, gifts I've been reading lately about."
00:16:08,00:16:13,"I just estimate that when you give someone a gift, there's, on average, a 10 to 30% financial"
00:16:13,00:16:18,"loss that you're making, because obviously if you give someone a gift, if I give you a gift"
00:16:18,00:16:19,"James, then you give me a gift."
00:16:19,00:16:23,And that was something I decided was too expensive to buy with my own money.
00:16:23,00:16:27,"This isn't going to cut it at Christmas when you go to your family, and they say, ""Where's"
00:16:27,00:16:28,"our gift?"""
00:16:28,00:16:29,"And you go, ""Economist estimates."""
00:16:29,00:16:30,That's what I'm doing.
00:16:30,00:16:36,"They're taking into account the emotional effect of the gift, but certainly from a value"
00:16:36,00:16:37,perspective.
00:16:37,00:16:38,"But gifts aren't worth it, guys."
00:16:38,00:16:43,"In Japan, they have an amazing gift-giving culture, where if somebody gives you a gift, you"
00:16:43,00:16:49,"need to give them back a gift of half of the value of the original gift, and then the"
00:16:49,00:16:54,"original gift-giver gives a card, and that finishes the gift cycle."
00:16:54,00:17:04,"Oh, so you kind of have to have a £5 book token on you at all times in case someone gives"
00:17:04,00:17:05,you a £10 one.
00:17:05,00:17:10,"This is why all the candies and all of the stuff in Japan, it all comes individually wrapped,"
00:17:10,00:17:14,so you can buy a big box and give one to everybody in your office and stuff.
00:17:14,00:17:16,And then you have to give you half of that.
00:17:16,00:17:18,And then you've got to get them all cards.
00:17:18,00:17:19,"Oh, that's terrible."
00:17:19,00:17:20,"Absolutely, hell."
00:17:20,00:17:22,"Also, you have to ask the really rude question when someone gives you a gift of, so how"
00:17:22,00:17:23,much was this?
00:17:23,00:17:26,I reckon they deduce that.
00:17:26,00:17:27,That's all within the soul.
00:17:27,00:17:28,"Yeah, you have to guess."
00:17:28,00:17:29,Majesty.
00:17:29,00:17:32,What do you get when someone gives you a flat pack with Shelley?
00:17:32,00:17:33,Yeah.
00:17:33,00:17:38,"Do you remember when Barack Obama came to visit Gordon Brown, and Gordon Brown gave Barack"
00:17:38,00:17:43,Obama a pen holder carve from the timbers of the sister ship from which the White House
00:17:43,00:17:44,desk is made.
00:17:44,00:17:45,Oh.
00:17:45,00:17:49,"And the first edition of a seven-volume biography of Winston Churchill, and Barack Obama"
00:17:49,00:17:55,gave Gordon Brown a 25 DVD box set that didn't work on British DVD.
00:17:55,00:17:57,"Oh, what was it of?"
00:17:57,00:18:01,"It was just of the 25 top films of all time, and I think if I list, he'd just gone through"
00:18:01,00:18:02,the top 25.
00:18:02,00:18:03,Like a mixtape.
00:18:03,00:18:04,Yeah.
00:18:04,00:18:13,"When Donald Rumswell went to Iraq, he gave Saddam Hussein some medieval spiked hammers, and Saddam"
00:18:13,00:18:18,Hussein gave him back a video documenting Syrian atrocities.
00:18:18,00:18:19,"Oh, wow."
00:18:19,00:18:21,"It was people starving puppies, wasn't it?"
00:18:21,00:18:22,Yeah.
00:18:22,00:18:27,"There's an amazing thing online, so if an American president is given a gift, if the gift"
00:18:27,00:18:32,"is under $350 American, the president gets to keep the gift."
00:18:32,00:18:35,"If it's over that, it belongs to the people."
00:18:35,00:18:38,"And recently they did a list of all the countries that were given in presence, and the worst"
00:18:38,00:18:45,"one they decided was from Poland, who gave Obama when he visited in 2012."
00:18:45,00:18:52,"They gave him a computer game called Witcher 2, a DVD called Best of Witcher 2, a Witcher"
00:18:52,00:18:57,"2 gift box set, three golden Witcher 2 coins, a Witcher 2 book."
00:18:57,00:19:01,Witcher 2 stickers and an ivory colored Witcher 2 bust of one of the characters.
00:19:01,00:19:02,Wow.
00:19:02,00:19:03,That was his present.
00:19:03,00:19:06,"Andy, anything to add before we move on?"
00:19:06,00:19:10,"Gordon Brown's presence to Barack Obama cost 10,000 pounds, and the DVDs in return were"
00:19:10,00:19:15,"just, yes, the 25 best films of all time, as judged by one online firm."
00:19:15,00:19:21,"The following time that Gordon Brown had to give Barack Obama gifts, he gave him two books,"
00:19:21,00:19:26,"a Carnegie anthology about the Scottish American industrialist Andrew Carnegie, and Scottish"
00:19:26,00:19:27,estate tweeds.
00:19:27,00:19:31,So he kind of learned his lesson about giving the president a really good presence.
00:19:31,00:19:33,"Okay, we should move on, guys."
00:19:33,00:19:41,Here's another empress song.
00:19:41,00:19:55,"Okay, that song was called Cosmos, and it's now time for fact number three."
00:19:55,00:20:01,"James, my fight is that neuroscientists could tell if you are a musician simply by looking"
00:20:01,00:20:02,at your brain.
00:20:02,00:20:03,Wow.
00:20:03,00:20:08,"So this comes from a book called Musical Failure by Oliver Sachs, it's a great book called"
00:20:08,00:20:14,"about music and the brain, and he's basically saying that, yeah, the brain just develops"
00:20:14,00:20:17,differently from people who spend their whole life playing music.
00:20:17,00:20:21,I think it was Oliver Sachs that said that he reckons everybody has perfect pitch as
00:20:21,00:20:25,"a baby, but you learn to disregard it."
00:20:25,00:20:30,"And it's only the practice of music, which keeps that up, so he argues for the fact that you"
00:20:30,00:20:32,cannot learn perfect pitch as an adult.
00:20:32,00:20:36,"Also, as a baby, when you're two, you have more brain cells than you'll ever have again,"
00:20:36,00:20:37,don't you?
00:20:37,00:20:38,"Yeah, they say that."
00:20:38,00:20:39,So take advantage of it.
00:20:39,00:20:44,"And you can remove a large portion of the baby's brain, yeah, half and it can still function"
00:20:44,00:20:45,as a full brain.
00:20:45,00:20:46,"Of anyone's brain, I think."
00:20:46,00:20:47,What?
00:20:47,00:20:48,"Well, not an adult."
00:20:48,00:20:50,"No, no, you can move half of anyone's brain and it still works as a brain."
00:20:50,00:20:51,"Oh, that's not it."
00:20:51,00:20:54,I think you want to do it quite carefully.
00:20:54,00:20:57,"Like a clean knife, yeah."
00:20:57,00:21:01,"And so music and the brain, there's been lots of studies about that and there's been a study"
00:21:01,00:21:07,quite recently that looking at brain waves of musicians and they found that when two musicians
00:21:07,00:21:11,"play a duet, their brain waves synchronize, which is quite cool."
00:21:11,00:21:12,Wow.
00:21:12,00:21:13,Yeah.
00:21:13,00:21:16,And there's another one that they looked at jazz musicians as they're improvising and
00:21:16,00:21:21,found out that they turned off areas linked to self-sensoring and inhibition as they do
00:21:21,00:21:22,that.
00:21:22,00:21:27,And then there was another study by Harriet Walt University that looked at the kind of music
00:21:27,00:21:31,people liked and then gave them personality tests and found out what kind of personalities
00:21:31,00:21:32,they had.
00:21:32,00:21:38,"And they found that blues fans had high self-esteem, their creative, outgoing, gentle, and the tees."
00:21:38,00:21:49,"Jazz fans have high self-esteem, a creative, outgoing, at ease, classical, and the tees."
00:21:49,00:21:51,Classical music fans have high self-esteem.
00:21:51,00:21:54,"Their creative, abnormities."
00:21:54,00:22:00,"And rock and indie fans have low self-esteem, are not hardworking, not gentle, and not outgoing."
00:22:00,00:22:01,Excellent.
00:22:01,00:22:02,That's ash.
00:22:02,00:22:03,You're fine.
00:22:03,00:22:04,What's up?
00:22:04,00:22:08,"Sorry, I was just having a nap."
00:22:08,00:22:12,Couldn't keep up with all this.
00:22:12,00:22:15,"You can't tell amazing things from looking at people's brains, can't you?"
00:22:15,00:22:19,So it's a really reliable way to predict someone's political affiliations.
00:22:19,00:22:23,"If you look at someone's brain function, you've got an 82, not you personally, if you're a brain"
00:22:23,00:22:29,"surgeon, you've got an 82% chance of predicting someone's political affiliation, like how they"
00:22:29,00:22:30,would actually vote.
00:22:30,00:22:31,That's extraordinary.
00:22:31,00:22:32,So would that be a public and all-democrat?
00:22:32,00:22:34,"If they've had half the brain removed, they're a UKIP supporter."
00:22:34,00:22:35,Yep.
00:22:35,00:22:36,Wow.
00:22:36,00:22:37,Politics.
00:22:37,00:22:38,"Oh, my goodness."
00:22:38,00:22:39,It's a huge effort.
00:22:39,00:22:40,It's a huge effort.
00:22:40,00:22:41,"Oh, my God."
00:22:41,00:22:44,Another quite cool thing you can tell is you can predict if your relationship's going
00:22:44,00:22:45,to last.
00:22:45,00:22:46,What?
00:22:46,00:22:47,Yep.
00:22:47,00:22:49,So they looked at couples at the start of a relationship when they said they were
00:22:49,00:22:53,"falling in love, and the couples where their brain function showed that they were suppressing"
00:22:53,00:22:58,the area of the brain that usually is judgmental and the area of the brain that's selfish.
00:22:58,00:23:02,If they're more suppressed than the relationship lasts.
00:23:02,00:23:06,"So surely, let's all, like, there needs to be an app for this, right?"
00:23:06,00:23:08,"A brain scanning app, yeah, as soon as you meet someone."
00:23:08,00:23:09,Man.
00:23:09,00:23:10,"That's weird, isn't it?"
00:23:10,00:23:13,"It's too, it would be too scary for people to do."
00:23:13,00:23:15,Here's another thing that explains how little we know about the brain.
00:23:15,00:23:19,There was a case of a guy called Mr. B. We don't know what his real name was.
00:23:19,00:23:23,"He had bad OCD, depression and anxiety."
00:23:23,00:23:28,So he had shock therapy that gave him electric shocks and to theory was that they would change
00:23:28,00:23:30,"his brain wave, so whatever."
00:23:30,00:23:33,So the treatment worked actually quite well.
00:23:33,00:23:37,"His OCD went, his depression went, his anxiety went, but it had a strange side effect."
00:23:37,00:23:41,It turned him into the world's biggest Johnny Cash fan.
00:23:41,00:23:46,"Before the surgery, Mr. B was a casual music listener who liked Dutch music, the Beatles"
00:23:46,00:23:51,"and the Rolling Stones, but after the treatment, he bought every Johnny Cash CD and DVD he"
00:23:51,00:23:54,could get his hands on and he wouldn't listen to anything else.
00:23:54,00:23:55,That's amazing.
00:23:55,00:23:58,"Okay, Andy, you got anything to add?"
00:23:58,00:23:59,This is interesting.
00:23:59,00:24:00,On a perfect pitch.
00:24:00,00:24:05,"It's also more common among blind people, for whom if you have a perfect pitch, it's more"
00:24:05,00:24:09,"handy to work out whether a car is moving on which direction or footsteps, it sort of"
00:24:09,00:24:12,gives me more of an idea of your surroundings.
00:24:12,00:24:15,"And also for people who speak other languages, because a third of the world's language is"
00:24:15,00:24:22,"a tonal, and to understand, yeah, tie Vietnamese and lots of Chinese languages that you need"
00:24:22,00:24:25,pitch to work out what someone's actually saying to you.
00:24:25,00:24:32,"So, it's interesting that a pitch is not as powerful in our brains as rhythm and that you"
00:24:32,00:24:36,can lose through head traumas and disease and stuff.
00:24:36,00:24:41,"You can lose your ability to differentiate pitch, but it's really, really difficult to"
00:24:41,00:24:46,lose your idea of rhythm and your sense of rhythm.
00:24:46,00:24:47,That's weird.
00:24:47,00:24:51,"Yeah, so it goes back way further, yeah."
00:24:51,00:24:53,"Okay, we need to wrap this one up."
00:24:53,00:25:02,Here's another preview from the MPS album.
00:25:02,00:25:13,"That song was called Cosmic Cat, and now it's time for the final fact of the show, and that's"
00:25:13,00:25:18,"my fact, and my fact this week is during World War II, Jack Warner, who was the head of Warner"
00:25:18,00:25:20,Brother Studio and the founder.
00:25:20,00:25:25,"He realized that from the air, his Hollywood studios were indistinguishable from a nearby"
00:25:25,00:25:30,"aircraft factory, and as they were worried of bombing happening at the time, he had a giant"
00:25:30,00:25:35,arrow painted on the rooftop with the words Lockheed that away.
00:25:35,00:25:39,"Taking that a bit further, what everyone in America should have done was painted on their"
00:25:39,00:25:43,"roof white house this way, so no one got bummed apart from the white house."
00:25:43,00:25:44,That's true.
00:25:44,00:25:46,"Wait, why do you want to bum the white house?"
00:25:46,00:25:50,"If you're Jack Warner, you don't want people to bum your studio, so you've painted arrow"
00:25:50,00:25:51,on it.
00:25:51,00:25:52,"So, surely everyone should paint an arrow on their houses."
00:25:52,00:25:54,I'm asking them to bum the president.
00:25:54,00:25:56,"Or just away from my house, please."
00:25:56,00:26:03,"Yeah, exactly."
00:26:03,00:26:07,I saw an interview with the next head of the US military a couple of years ago.
00:26:07,00:26:12,"I think it was on Vice Magazine, and the interviewer posed the question whether if the whole world"
00:26:12,00:26:17,"got together in attack to America, whether they could land a single troop on American soil,"
00:26:17,00:26:19,and he reckoned no.
00:26:19,00:26:20,Really?
00:26:20,00:26:21,They'd stop us before we even got to the--
00:26:21,00:26:27,"Americans if the whole world got together, not one troop would get landed on American soil."
00:26:27,00:26:28,That's really funny.
00:26:28,00:26:30,"Yeah, but surely Canada's on our side."
00:26:30,00:26:31,And Mexico was really close.
00:26:31,00:26:32,"Yeah, exactly."
00:26:32,00:26:36,"He was like South America and America, and that's-- he was like accounting for them."
00:26:36,00:26:39,"Well, I think we should try it."
00:26:39,00:26:40,I'm free tomorrow.
00:26:40,00:26:41,"Okay, let's do it."
00:26:41,00:26:44,Can I just say to the NSA if they're listening?
00:26:44,00:26:45,I don't think that's a very good idea at all.
00:26:45,00:26:53,"And when I say if they're listening, I just with the thing of Jack Warner painting a massive"
00:26:53,00:26:57,"arrow on the roof, the thing that I liked about it, though, was the idea that if there was"
00:26:57,00:27:01,"a Japanese bomber flying over, they would look down to it and they'd be like, oh, directions."
00:27:01,00:27:03,And I've always wondered about directions.
00:27:03,00:27:07,"Like how do you-- back then, how did you get flight directions if you didn't have a map"
00:27:07,00:27:08,for the area or whatever?
00:27:08,00:27:10,There are big concrete arrows in America.
00:27:10,00:27:13,"That's what-- yeah, that's an extraordinary thing that I had no idea about."
00:27:13,00:27:18,"Yeah, the post in America, the way that they used to direct the postman, was to have these"
00:27:18,00:27:24,"huge concrete arrows slabs on the ground, and they would just bring you from the east coast"
00:27:24,00:27:25,to the west coast and back again.
00:27:25,00:27:26,And so--
00:27:26,00:27:27,Like in a plane.
00:27:27,00:27:29,"Yeah, in a plane you'd look down at it and see an arrow going that way."
00:27:29,00:27:30,"All right, things about roofs."
00:27:30,00:27:31,"Oh, yeah."
00:27:31,00:27:36,"As soon as that was the point at the start, that apparently there are churches in the UK that"
00:27:36,00:27:40,"have a thing called the voice of God, which is a microphone on top of their roof, that"
00:27:40,00:27:46,"when you're trying to steal metal, steal lead from the roof, then it'll say, stop doing that"
00:27:46,00:27:49,"to a terrible person, you're going to hell, kind of thing."
00:27:49,00:27:53,And there seems to be a lot of news articles about people painting penises on the top of roofs.
00:27:53,00:27:55,I've seen at least two or three of those.
00:27:55,00:27:56,Yeah.
00:27:56,00:27:58,There was one in Hungerford in 2009.
00:27:58,00:28:05,A guy called Rory painted a large phallic symbol on his parents' roof.
00:28:05,00:28:10,"And his mother, Claire, 49, said, ""We don't want any more children."
00:28:10,00:28:14,"Well, the idea of sleeping under a giant phallic symbol is rather worrying."""
00:28:14,00:28:16,She's kind of missing the point.
00:28:16,00:28:20,"I think the journalist must have pointed out to them that it was a phallic symbol, because"
00:28:20,00:28:21,she said that.
00:28:21,00:28:25,"And then the husband said, ""We don't want to lie in bed at night and hear couples at it"
00:28:25,00:28:29,"above us,"" which is a really confusing quote, but I think he's implying that roundy couples"
00:28:29,00:28:31,are going to come and go to their room.
00:28:31,00:28:33,"Oh, like they do in the sernab, but it's one."
00:28:33,00:28:34,"Exactly, exactly."
00:28:34,00:28:37,But I did like that story because they only found out that he'd done it when he was
00:28:37,00:28:39,away on his gap year.
00:28:39,00:28:42,"So they wrung him up, and he was in Brazil at that time."
00:28:42,00:28:46,"So he just said, ""Oh, you found it then."""
00:28:46,00:28:49,"Jack Warner, just very quickly about his character, because I didn't know much about him."
00:28:49,00:28:51,It's one of the biggest movie studio names.
00:28:51,00:28:53,We all know Warner Brothers.
00:28:53,00:28:57,"Originally, they were called One Scolaser."
00:28:57,00:28:58,That was their surname.
00:28:58,00:29:01,"So it could have been One Scolaser Brothers, but they changed it to Warner."
00:29:01,00:29:06,They initially started as three brothers who were just getting into the movie business.
00:29:06,00:29:10,They started the business as a result of their dad selling his gold watch and then selling
00:29:10,00:29:12,their horse called Bob.
00:29:12,00:29:15,"And Jack Warner was a really interesting character, very hated."
00:29:15,00:29:16,He outdid all of his brothers.
00:29:16,00:29:20,"He got them to sell their shares, saying that all of them were going to share it, and then"
00:29:20,00:29:25,"he bought them all back the next day on his own, and they never spoke to each other again."
00:29:25,00:29:29,"Even to the point when they fell out that when his brother died, Harry died, they asked"
00:29:29,00:29:34,"the press were like, ""Hey, any response,"" and he said, ""I don't give a shit about Harry."""
00:29:34,00:29:35,"I mean, that's intense."
00:29:35,00:29:40,"He said, ""If you look at quotes of his online, all the quotes are just like one that was to"
00:29:40,00:29:45,"an actress where he said, 'You were very good playing a bitch, heroin, but you shouldn't"
00:29:45,00:29:46,"win an award for playing yourself.'"""
00:29:46,00:29:47,That's harsh.
00:29:47,00:29:54,"And he also apparently met Albert Einstein, and when he met Albert Einstein, he said to"
00:29:54,00:29:57,"him, ""I too have a theory of relativity."
00:29:57,00:29:58,"Don't hire them."""
00:29:58,00:30:03,"But yeah, him and his older brother, Harry, had a terrible relationship, and there was one"
00:30:03,00:30:09,"account of them, Harry running through the studio chasing Jack, wielding a lead piping,"
00:30:09,00:30:12,"screaming, ""I'm going to kill you,"" which is just so seems like it was the inspiration"
00:30:12,00:30:13,for a lot of cartoons that followed it.
00:30:13,00:30:14,Yeah.
00:30:14,00:30:17,Did a lot of people get killed by lead piping in the old days?
00:30:17,00:30:19,Maybe they just played Cludeau.
00:30:19,00:30:22,That's why Cludeau was a really insensitive game when it first came out.
00:30:22,00:30:25,All I know about one of brothers is they used to make cartoons.
00:30:25,00:30:29,"Yeah, it's weird that they made all those big films, and now we associate one of brothers"
00:30:29,00:30:35,"so much with cartoons, but they made quite a lot of politically incorrect, I'm going to"
00:30:35,00:30:36,say cartoons.
00:30:36,00:30:39,"There is a group of films called The Sensored Eleven, which are the 11 Warner Bros. films"
00:30:39,00:30:42,which had to be suppressed from 1950's onwards.
00:30:42,00:30:49,"Did you know when Jack Warner was young and his parents ran this movie theatre, he used"
00:30:49,00:30:54,"to be a tracer, which is somebody who would come on in between the movies and sing to clear"
00:30:54,00:30:55,out the audience?
00:30:55,00:30:56,"Oh, together, second audience ink."
00:30:56,00:31:01,"Maybe that's what all his bitterness comes from, is the fact that he was employed to be a"
00:31:01,00:31:02,sh*t thing.
00:31:02,00:31:06,"He was, yeah, he was a Vloderville performer when he was younger and totally failed at it and"
00:31:06,00:31:12,"was really well-known at just being a bad comic and always having really bad jokes, but"
00:31:12,00:31:16,being quite keen and trying to make people laugh or just failing.
00:31:16,00:31:17,Just on Warner Bros.
00:31:17,00:31:18,Yeah.
00:31:18,00:31:20,"Do you know the, was Flintstone's Warner Bros. production?"
00:31:20,00:31:22,I started looking at all the other shows.
00:31:22,00:31:23,Hallabarara.
00:31:23,00:31:24,Hallabarara wasn't it?
00:31:24,00:31:25,Oh yeah.
00:31:25,00:31:26,"Oh, on Hannabarara actually."
00:31:26,00:31:32,"Tom and Jerry the other day, the last Tom and Jerry cartoon that, um, Hannabarara directed,"
00:31:32,00:31:34,they commit joint suicide at the end of it.
00:31:34,00:31:35,So what?
00:31:35,00:31:40,"They both get dumped by their respective girlfriends and so I think Tom gets, which one is the cat?"
00:31:40,00:31:41,Tom's the cat?
00:31:41,00:31:42,"Tom, yeah."
00:31:42,00:31:45,"So he gets dumped first so he's singing ""Rude Pressed"" and then Jerry gets dumped and they"
00:31:45,00:31:48,sit on a railway line and it ends with them sitting waiting for the train to come and mow
00:31:48,00:31:49,them down.
00:31:49,00:31:50,That's so dark.
00:31:50,00:31:51,"Yeah, it's really weird."
00:31:51,00:31:52,They committed suicide.
00:31:52,00:31:53,"Yeah, they did."
00:31:53,00:31:55,"Together, but it's quite sweet because they did it together, they finally..."
00:31:55,00:31:58,So the side packs are never sweet.
00:31:58,00:32:02,"Um, so the Flintstones used to be sponsored by Winston cigarettes and so it used to have"
00:32:02,00:32:07,adverse Winston cigarettes at the beginning in the end of it and there was a public outcry
00:32:07,00:32:12,"about this because one of the most famous was when Fred and Barney, a sneak round the"
00:32:12,00:32:15,"back of the house, when the women are doing the house work and they sit down and have"
00:32:15,00:32:19,a cigarette and they talk about how great it is that they're smoking these great cigarettes
00:32:19,00:32:24,"while their wives are doing all the hard work and Fred Flintstone said, ""Winston tastes"
00:32:24,00:32:29,"good like cigarettes should"" and there was public outcry because that's a misuse of the"
00:32:29,00:32:32,"word ""like"" and it should be as cigarettes should."
00:32:32,00:32:33,[laughter]
00:32:33,00:32:36,You're pretty angry about that.
00:32:36,00:32:37,Wonderful.
00:32:37,00:32:41,"Okay, Andy, anything to add?"
00:32:41,00:32:45,"On American military might, America spends more on its military than the next 15 countries"
00:32:45,00:32:51,combined and the total amount of land area occupied by US bases and facilities is bigger than
00:32:51,00:32:55,"Washington, D.C., Massachusetts and New Jersey combined."
00:32:55,00:33:01,"And on Roof Pinesia, I've just found two headlines from the Metro that I want to leave you"
00:33:01,00:33:02,with.
00:33:02,00:33:08,"Man, surprised by massive roof penis and school surprised by 20 foot penis, so there you"
00:33:08,00:33:09,go.
00:33:09,00:33:14,"Okay, that's it."
00:33:14,00:33:15,That's all of our facts.
00:33:15,00:33:17,Thanks everyone for listening.
00:33:17,00:33:20,If you want to get in contact with any of us about the things that we've spoken about in
