1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,500
 We run it on QI a few years ago.

2
00:00:02,500 --> 00:00:03,500
 Yeah.

3
00:00:03,500 --> 00:00:05,500
 Which was, there's no such thing as a fish.

4
00:00:05,500 --> 00:00:06,500
 You know the nicer thing as a fish.

5
00:00:06,500 --> 00:00:07,500
 No, seriously.

6
00:00:07,500 --> 00:00:10,500
 It's in the Oxford Dictionary of Underwater Life.

7
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:12,500
 It says it right there, first paragraph.

8
00:00:12,500 --> 00:00:14,000
 No such thing as a fish.

9
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:24,900
 Hello, and welcome to another episode of No Such Thing as a Fish, a weekly podcast coming

10
00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:27,300
 to you from the QI offices in Harvard Garden.

11
00:00:27,300 --> 00:00:31,700
 My name is Dan Schreiber, I'm sitting here with Anich Zinski, James Arkin, and a fact-checking

12
00:00:31,700 --> 00:00:33,500
 Judy's Andy Murray.

13
00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:38,000
 And joining us, as well, is a very special guest, is Ash Gardner, the lead singer of Emperor

14
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,000
 Yes, the band whose song we use is our theme tune.

15
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,400
 And they've just got a new album out, it's called An Island Called Earth.

16
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:48,100
 And throughout the show, during the interstitial moments, instead of our regular stings, we're

17
00:00:48,100 --> 00:00:52,600
 going to be using extracts from songs from that album that you should definitely buy.

18
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:56,600
 Also, at the end of the show, we're going to play a full track single from the album called

19
00:00:56,600 --> 00:00:57,600
 Monkey King.

20
00:00:57,600 --> 00:00:58,600
 Hello, Ash.

21
00:00:58,600 --> 00:00:59,600
 Hey, what's up, guys?

22
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:00,600
 I'm Ash.

23
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:01,600
 Good evening.

24
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:05,000
 All right, let's begin with fact number one, and we're going to start with you, Ash.

25
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,000
 Cool.

26
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:13,300
 So, my fact that I have today is that in 1060 BCE, the Egyptian city of Pyramsys was moved

27
00:01:13,300 --> 00:01:22,800
 20 kilometers to the north, including obelisk, finksys, temples, steely.

28
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:24,600
 Why did they move it?

29
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:30,960
 Well, their tributary of the Nile that they were on dried up as the Nile is carrying so much

30
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:35,800
 sediment, it's constantly filling itself up, and they're in the Nile Delta.

31
00:01:35,800 --> 00:01:39,600
 So, yeah, they're a bit of the river move, they're fresh water left them, so they...

32
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:40,600
 Can I chase it?

33
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:41,600
 Yep.

34
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:42,600
 Did they wait?

35
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:45,760
 I mean, because you know, you don't wake up one night and go, oh my god, there's 20 kilometers

36
00:01:45,760 --> 00:01:46,760
 of silk where there was a river.

37
00:01:46,760 --> 00:01:50,960
 So, they must have waited and just gone to and from the Nile until gradually it was just

38
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:56,200
 that bit too far, and then one day it's gone just a centimeter too far for me now.

39
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:58,960
 So, let's go 20 kilometers up that direction?

40
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:00,960
 Yeah, carrying all this shit.

41
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:05,560
 There is a river that changes direction in the year, I think it's a tonlay sap, is it,

42
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:10,320
 in Cambodia, and it goes towards the lake for half the year, and then it changes direction

43
00:02:10,320 --> 00:02:12,320
 and goes away from the lake for the rest of the year.

44
00:02:12,320 --> 00:02:17,480
 And that's because the Mekong River has so much water flowing down it that when it reaches

45
00:02:17,480 --> 00:02:20,720
 the sea, it can't get the water into the sea quick enough.

46
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:25,920
 It backs up and fills up a lake, I think in the wet season that lake is 10% of the size

47
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:26,920
 of Cambodia.

48
00:02:26,920 --> 00:02:32,520
 So, the Nile was really important, of course, for the Egyptians, so much so that the new

49
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:37,160
 year began at the flooding, so whenever the flooding was, that was when the new year was.

50
00:02:37,160 --> 00:02:42,700
 The maps were orientated so that the source of the Nile was at the top, so the north was

51
00:02:42,700 --> 00:02:45,360
 in the south and the south was in the north, as we would imagine.

52
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:51,520
 Which, of course, upper Egypt is the southern bit of the river.

53
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:56,000
 That's upper Egypt is the bit that headstores Sudan and Ethiopia.

54
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:00,360
 And so important was it that it flooded every year that Egyptian pharaohs would ritually

55
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:03,400
 masturbate into the Nile to ensure an abundance of water.

56
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:05,560
 Does that ensure it?

57
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:10,560
 What was the belief behind giving birth to more water?

58
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:15,660
 Is it just literally to provide more liquid? They think that tiny deposit is going to tip

59
00:03:15,660 --> 00:03:16,660
 it over the edge?

60
00:03:16,660 --> 00:03:17,660
 Well, who knows?

61
00:03:17,660 --> 00:03:20,160
 I think the deposit was in those days.

62
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:24,400
 But yeah, no, it was, like, because it was a bringer of life, et cetera.

63
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:25,400
 Wow.

64
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:26,400
 Did they do that to other stuff?

65
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:27,400
 Their ill friend?

66
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:28,400
 Yeah.

67
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:33,200
 Apparently Cleopatra had the first vibrator and apparently it was a wooden box with a

68
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:34,720
 bee on the inside of it.

69
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:42,080
 The bee was got boo, that was the vibrating element. I believe the vibrator was the fourth electronic

70
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:45,320
 thing to be powered by electricity when electricity was first invented.

71
00:03:45,320 --> 00:03:46,320
 Totally.

72
00:03:46,320 --> 00:03:47,560
 Can't remember what the other three were.

73
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:48,560
 Weirdly.

74
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:49,560
 That's the only one I remember.

75
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:50,560
 Don't have any lights.

76
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:53,760
 So the guy who moved the town, it was Ramsey's the second, who...

77
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:55,920
 Ramsey's the second was the one who built it.

78
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:56,920
 It was the one who built it.

79
00:03:56,920 --> 00:04:03,280
 Who's also the guy whose body we transported to Paris in 1974, didn't we, and he's the only

80
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:05,240
 dead person who's ever had a passport, I think.

81
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:06,240
 Oh, really?

82
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:07,240
 Clearly.

83
00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:10,240
 On his passport, his occupation was listed as King, Brackett's deceased.

84
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:11,240
 Wow.

85
00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:15,560
 The only other thing I know about the city that was moved is, I think, we thought for ages

86
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:18,440
 that it was in a location which is now Tannis, didn't we?

87
00:04:18,440 --> 00:04:19,440
 Yeah.

88
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:24,360
 And then they realised that all the objects that they could date back to Pyramsys were

89
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:25,520
 actually located in...

90
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:26,520
 Quanteur.

91
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:27,520
 Quanteur.

92
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:28,520
 Quanteur.

93
00:04:28,520 --> 00:04:31,320
 But Tannis is where they set, like, Raiders of the Lost Ark, isn't it?

94
00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:32,320
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

95
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:36,840
 It's where the Ark of the Covenant was supposed to be taken to in Indiana Jones, yeah.

96
00:04:36,840 --> 00:04:37,840
 Yeah.

97
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:38,840
 Now we're getting into Dan Territory.

98
00:04:38,840 --> 00:04:39,840
 Dan, Dan.

99
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:40,840
 Dan, Dan.

100
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:45,880
 Apparently they were saying that Tannis would be up there amongst the most famous of discoveries

101
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:49,440
 next to Tutankhamun, had it been found in a different period of time, but it was found

102
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:51,560
 just as World War II broke out, I think.

103
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:52,560
 Oh, really?

104
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:56,480
 So, as a result, no one really talks about it, but they found so much there.

105
00:04:56,480 --> 00:05:00,160
 They found everything from their pottery to their, as you say, temples and...

106
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:02,000
 And huge structures, right?

107
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,240
 How big was the biggest one?

108
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:06,560
 Really big, 200 tons was the biggest obelisk that they moved.

109
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:09,960
 Yeah, so how much are we talking here in terms of the stuff that they moved?

110
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:16,120
 So, multiple sphinxes, all of the temples and buildings they took apart, break-by-break

111
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:20,840
 and moved those, but the obelisks and stuff were moved whole...

112
00:05:20,840 --> 00:05:21,840
 Sphinxes.

113
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:24,400
 Yeah, they had more than one sphinx there, didn't they?

114
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:25,400
 Yeah.

115
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:30,080
 So, the thing about the sphinxes, is it right that it was under sand for like hundreds

116
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:33,560
 and hundreds of years and then they just kind of found the top of its head and then they dug

117
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:34,560
 down and...

118
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:35,560
 Yeah, that is pretty right.

119
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:39,240
 That was like around Napoleon and his lot when they turned up, they've got photographs

120
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:42,640
 from around that time period where just the head of the sphinxes sticking out.

121
00:05:42,640 --> 00:05:43,640
 That's so cool.

122
00:05:43,640 --> 00:05:44,640
 Wow, so have we actually dug to the bottom?

123
00:05:44,640 --> 00:05:46,640
 Is he like on a tricycle, maybe?

124
00:05:46,640 --> 00:05:47,640
 Or is there more time to work?

125
00:05:47,640 --> 00:05:50,640
 Yeah, you can see his feet, but we can't see the bottom of the bottom.

126
00:05:50,640 --> 00:05:51,640
 Yeah, what's...

127
00:05:51,640 --> 00:05:52,640
 Yeah.

128
00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:53,640
 What could he be on?

129
00:05:53,640 --> 00:05:54,640
 Or she?

130
00:05:54,640 --> 00:05:59,480
 They think that the sphinxes, the face of Kufu, which is the person who the great pyramid

131
00:05:59,480 --> 00:06:02,040
 was built for, so maybe the sphinxes are guy.

132
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:03,040
 Yeah.

133
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:06,200
 I thought the sphinxes were a woman and that when she's riddling, then she's female.

134
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:07,200
 I'm pretty sure.

135
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:08,200
 Yeah, so...

136
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:10,920
 Is it true that Napoleon actually shot off the nose or not?

137
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:11,920
 Questionally.

138
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:12,920
 No, we don't think so.

139
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:13,920
 Really?

140
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:17,680
 Yeah, we think this photos of it without a nose before Napoleon came along.

141
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:18,680
 Right.

142
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:19,680
 It also had...

143
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:21,360
 It also had sketches and stuff from before Napoleon.

144
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:22,360
 Yeah, probably not photos.

145
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:23,360
 Photos.

146
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:28,480
 It also had one of those things that come off the shit out of Brated Beard.

147
00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:30,960
 A Brated Beard, which is in the British Museum.

148
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:34,040
 There aren't cases throughout history of us moving, just great structures, aren't there?

149
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:35,040
 Yeah.

150
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:36,040
 Like we moved Tower Bridge.

151
00:06:36,040 --> 00:06:38,160
 That's what it reminded me of, is when we took a part...

152
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:41,640
 Sorry, London Bridge, that's the myth that it was Tower Bridge.

153
00:06:41,640 --> 00:06:46,160
 We sold London Bridge to the Americans, didn't we, and it was the guy who sold it numbered

154
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:49,320
 every brick, so it was taken apart a bit by bit and then could be put back together

155
00:06:49,320 --> 00:06:50,320
 exactly the same way.

156
00:06:50,320 --> 00:06:51,320
 Oh, wow.

157
00:06:51,320 --> 00:06:56,520
 This read that the windows of Lincoln Cathedral, the stained glass windows, they took them apart,

158
00:06:56,520 --> 00:07:00,360
 piece by piece, and then labeled them all and then put them back, wants to put them back

159
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:01,360
 as a jigsaw.

160
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:04,240
 This was during the war because they didn't want them to get smashed.

161
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:09,240
 And then someone lost the picture of what it was, so they had to do it painstakingly and

162
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:12,840
 just work out where everything was, and I emailed them and it's not true.

163
00:07:12,840 --> 00:07:13,840
 Oh, yeah.

164
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:14,840
 Thanks.

165
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:15,840
 I know.

166
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:16,840
 I know.

167
00:07:16,840 --> 00:07:21,240
 The whole topic, but the way that Talking Heads recorded Remain in Light, is that every

168
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:26,240
 progressive instrument would play constantly throughout every song.

169
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:31,520
 And then when they came to mix the album, they muted, they automated the mutes for on-off

170
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:35,200
 for the different progressive sections, so they're like, "Oh, we want a cowbell here."

171
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:36,200
 That is...

172
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:37,200
 Hey, there's a cowbell.

173
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:38,200
 Insane.

174
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:42,400
 So when they went back to remix it or remaster it about 10 years ago and they listened to it,

175
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:43,400
 they went...

176
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:44,400
 Oh, wow.

177
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:49,720
 It sounds like they played it before they'd written it, like they just got everyone to play

178
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:50,720
 everything.

179
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:51,720
 Yeah.

180
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:52,720
 And then we didn't have time to write anything, guys.

181
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:53,720
 Yeah.

182
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:54,720
 So play everything.

183
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:55,720
 We'll write the song through the music.

184
00:07:55,720 --> 00:07:56,720
 We'll write it later.

185
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:57,720
 Yeah.

186
00:07:57,720 --> 00:07:59,920
 So Ramsey's had...

187
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:04,200
 He apparently had over 200 different wives, and with these 200 different wives, he

188
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:11,000
 had 69 sons and over 60 daughters.

189
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:15,440
 He's still quite well to get so many kids considering he was masturbating into the bio-adgressing

190
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:16,440
 of that.

191
00:08:16,440 --> 00:08:18,600
 Maybe it was swimming in the mirror.

192
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:19,760
 Maybe it was swimming in the mirror.

193
00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:25,800
 One tiny thing which I really like, because speaking of moving buildings, is that Ataturk

194
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:27,760
 was a big fan of nature.

195
00:08:27,760 --> 00:08:30,480
 And he had his "Yellowver" mansion.

196
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:34,920
 He was told by the people who built his "Yellowver" mansion that there was a tree in the

197
00:08:34,920 --> 00:08:38,160
 way of it, and they were going to have to cut down this tree with a plain tree.

198
00:08:38,160 --> 00:08:40,960
 And instead of letting them cut it down, he made them move the entire mansion.

199
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:42,520
 Four meters to the left.

200
00:08:42,520 --> 00:08:43,520
 Wow.

201
00:08:43,520 --> 00:08:47,320
 Yeah, dedication, nature, bit annoying for their construction workers.

202
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:54,280
 Also, the biggest stone to ever be moved, this is a bit random, but it was moved in Russia,

203
00:08:54,280 --> 00:08:57,000
 and it was moved not that long ago, like 200 years ago.

204
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,000
 Yeah.

205
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:03,280
 They just decided to tug a massive stone as bigger than any stone, humans have moved

206
00:09:03,280 --> 00:09:05,280
 ever, any of the Egyptian...

207
00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:06,280
 Yeah.

208
00:09:06,280 --> 00:09:07,920
 Why did they do that?

209
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:08,920
 Just for a smash, right?

210
00:09:08,920 --> 00:09:10,920
 It was a strong man contest.

211
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:13,160
 Yeah, it was routine, wasn't it?

212
00:09:13,160 --> 00:09:15,160
 Just rubbing it and pushing it.

213
00:09:15,160 --> 00:09:21,120
 No, there was a bigger stone, actually, and this was the Romans, they cut it, but they couldn't

214
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:22,120
 move it.

215
00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:26,680
 So they cut it out, it was this massive rock, they were going to move it to a city as a big

216
00:09:26,680 --> 00:09:29,640
 temple thing, but it was just so big, they couldn't move it, and it's still there, where

217
00:09:29,640 --> 00:09:30,960
 they cut it.

218
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:32,640
 You couldn't be going to everything, Romans.

219
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:33,640
 Okay.

220
00:09:33,640 --> 00:09:34,640
 Idiots.

221
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:36,640
 Okay, Andy, anything to add?

222
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:41,360
 Yes, there's... so you're all doing very well.

223
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:44,520
 Interesting thing about the Sphinx, the Greek Sphinx was a woman, but the Egyptian Sphinx

224
00:09:44,520 --> 00:09:50,920
 was typically shown as a man, which is called an Andro Sphinx.

225
00:09:50,920 --> 00:09:54,920
 On river-changing directions, actually, the Amazon once flowed in the opposite direction.

226
00:09:54,920 --> 00:09:57,560
 It used to flow from the Atlantic Ocean to the Pacific.

227
00:09:57,560 --> 00:09:58,560
 Wow.

228
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:02,560
 Yeah, until at least 65 million years ago, which is cool.

229
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:07,000
 Okay, so vibrator stuff, I have found a source which claims that the vibrator was the fifth

230
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:11,800
 household appliance to be electrified, and the fourth one was the clothes iron, but the

231
00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:16,840
 first mechanical vibrator was actually steam-powered, and was called the manipulator.

232
00:10:16,840 --> 00:10:17,840
 And on the...

233
00:10:17,840 --> 00:10:21,840
 You couldn't silently get away with that one, couldn't you?

234
00:10:21,840 --> 00:10:24,480
 I'm just going to go to my room and get an early night.

235
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:26,880
 Why are you going down to the cold shed again?

236
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:27,880
 It was massive.

237
00:10:27,880 --> 00:10:29,640
 It had to be kept in a separate room.

238
00:10:29,640 --> 00:10:33,200
 The vibrator room, they go up in Jane Austen's novels.

239
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:36,200
 Sort of poked through into the next room, basically, if I can...

240
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:37,200
 It's pretty...

241
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:39,200
 The beginnings of the glory hole.

242
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:40,200
 Wow, yeah.

243
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:43,320
 Okay, we should move on.

244
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:48,560
 Let's have a quick burst of a empress-yass song.

245
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:59,440
 Okay, that was Pyramese Titanis, that little extract you heard just there, from

246
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:04,600
 my asses album, that was exactly the subject that we were just talking about for his fact.

247
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:07,560
 Okay, time for fact number two, Chazinski.

248
00:11:07,560 --> 00:11:13,160
 My fact is that in 1864, one of Charles Dickens' friends had a flat-packed Swiss chalet delivered

249
00:11:13,160 --> 00:11:15,800
 to his home as a Christmas present.

250
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:17,520
 And that wouldn't have fit in the stocking?

251
00:11:17,520 --> 00:11:18,520
 No, didn't.

252
00:11:18,520 --> 00:11:24,160
 So, it was Charles Dickens' actor friend, and he had it delivered to Hyam Station near

253
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:25,160
 Dickens' house.

254
00:11:25,160 --> 00:11:28,880
 It arrived in 58 boxes and was split into 94 pieces.

255
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:34,840
 And yeah, Dickens had to go pick it up, load it onto the carriage, multiple trips, I imagine,

256
00:11:34,840 --> 00:11:36,040
 and erect it at home.

257
00:11:36,040 --> 00:11:37,040
 Was it wrapped?

258
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:38,040
 Was it like every...

259
00:11:38,040 --> 00:11:39,840
 Was it disappointing every time he opened one of his...

260
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:40,840
 What is this?

261
00:11:40,840 --> 00:11:41,840
 How is this?

262
00:11:41,840 --> 00:11:43,440
 I wonder if it came with instructions.

263
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:46,960
 Well, because I do came with someone who knew what they were doing, probably in those

264
00:11:46,960 --> 00:11:49,640
 times, instructions was probably a human.

265
00:11:49,640 --> 00:11:52,560
 Oh, if only Macono did that now.

266
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:54,160
 Every box came with just a human being.

267
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:57,360
 But you can buy a flat-pack, IKEA house now, right?

268
00:11:57,360 --> 00:11:59,280
 And you assemble it, it has instructions.

269
00:11:59,280 --> 00:12:01,280
 I mean, I think they come and assemble it for you.

270
00:12:01,280 --> 00:12:02,280
 I'm guessing.

271
00:12:02,280 --> 00:12:06,160
 I don't think it's like one LM key and some instructions online are all from Germany, and

272
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:08,440
 they have guys that come and install them for you.

273
00:12:08,440 --> 00:12:09,440
 Yeah.

274
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:11,440
 So, I think that's quite a risky present to get to somebody.

275
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:12,440
 It's if they don't like it.

276
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:13,440
 How do you return that?

277
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:14,440
 Yeah.

278
00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:16,440
 Gift vouchers is definitely safer, isn't it?

279
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:17,440
 Yeah, swish on a gift voucher.

280
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:18,440
 Get that.

281
00:12:18,440 --> 00:12:23,480
 But unfortunately, he absolutely loved it, and he built it in a road run through Dickens'

282
00:12:23,480 --> 00:12:27,480
 property, and he built it on one side of the road and his home was on the other.

283
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:32,000
 So then he had to build a tunnel that ran from his house to the swish alley, because he

284
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,840
 didn't like having to cross the road, because, you know, he liked his privacy.

285
00:12:34,840 --> 00:12:39,520
 So he erected this entire tunnel, which still survives, where he used to escape his writing

286
00:12:39,520 --> 00:12:40,520
 shallay.

287
00:12:40,520 --> 00:12:41,520
 Oh.

288
00:12:41,520 --> 00:12:43,520
 So it's more like a shed, really, isn't it?

289
00:12:43,520 --> 00:12:44,520
 It's a story.

290
00:12:44,520 --> 00:12:45,520
 It's going to shed be two stories.

291
00:12:45,520 --> 00:12:46,520
 Yeah.

292
00:12:46,520 --> 00:12:47,520
 No.

293
00:12:47,520 --> 00:12:48,960
 He seemed like a really fun guy, as well.

294
00:12:48,960 --> 00:12:53,440
 He basically had a secret writing room, a secret area in his house that was

295
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:56,560
 hidden behind a bookshelf, which was a fake bookshelf.

296
00:12:56,560 --> 00:12:57,560
 Oh.

297
00:12:57,560 --> 00:13:01,000
 And so he had fake books on the bookshelf, and he actually, he came up with names.

298
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,000
 Oh, yeah.

299
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,000
 He even designed the books.

300
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,000
 Yeah.

301
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:08,440
 So some of the titles include Noah's Architecture, Was Shakespeare's Mother Fat, and

302
00:13:08,440 --> 00:13:11,480
 he had a nine volume set titled Cats Lives.

303
00:13:11,480 --> 00:13:12,480
 Yeah.

304
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:13,480
 Yeah, I don't know if it's true, but that's--

305
00:13:13,480 --> 00:13:14,480
 It is true.

306
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:15,480
 It's still a quest.

307
00:13:15,480 --> 00:13:16,480
 Where is the house and the tunnel?

308
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:17,480
 It was in Kent.

309
00:13:17,480 --> 00:13:19,320
 The Garden of England.

310
00:13:19,320 --> 00:13:24,880
 There is a village in-- I think it's in Kent, where they have a load of Charles Dickens'

311
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:26,360
 memorabilia and stuff.

312
00:13:26,360 --> 00:13:27,360
 And he never lived though.

313
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:30,400
 It was just a place he used to go on holiday sometimes.

314
00:13:30,400 --> 00:13:34,600
 And there was a counselor who was so annoyed that everyone was like calling their shop like

315
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:37,360
 Charles Dickens' shop or Charles Dickens' pub.

316
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:41,360
 He had a plaque put on his house saying, "Charles Dickens did not stay here."

317
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:42,360
 Really?

318
00:13:42,360 --> 00:13:43,360
 Yeah.

319
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:44,360
 Apparently.

320
00:13:44,360 --> 00:13:47,360
 I think this is the same town that, very recently, there was a school here, which was

321
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:50,280
 the Charles Dickens primary school, or just Charles Dickens school.

322
00:13:50,280 --> 00:13:53,280
 And they've taken Charles off the name now and put another title on.

323
00:13:53,280 --> 00:13:56,920
 I can't remember what it's called, but the town is furious about it.

324
00:13:56,920 --> 00:13:57,920
 Oh, really?

325
00:13:57,920 --> 00:13:58,920
 Yeah.

326
00:13:58,920 --> 00:13:59,920
 So they've taken Charles off, but they've kept Dickens?

327
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:00,920
 Yeah.

328
00:14:00,920 --> 00:14:01,920
 So it's the something Dickens school that--

329
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:03,640
 Maybe Frederick Dickens, his brother.

330
00:14:03,640 --> 00:14:09,120
 He was an alcoholic who used to borrow money on his brother's name just to get alcohol

331
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:10,120
 and then died.

332
00:14:10,120 --> 00:14:11,120
 You know, he died of alcohol.

333
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:12,120
 Is that something?

334
00:14:12,120 --> 00:14:13,120
 Yeah.

335
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:16,120
 And Dickens supported his family for the rest of his life, didn't he?

336
00:14:16,120 --> 00:14:17,120
 Did he?

337
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:18,120
 He died.

338
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:19,120
 He's-- it's very funny.

339
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:24,120
 I was looking into his great grandson, who performs a lot of his books now as live One Man

340
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:28,600
 plays, or maybe there's a cast, but his name's Gerald Charles Dickens.

341
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:29,600
 Oh, yeah.

342
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:32,440
 And what was very funny is, if you look into all the great, great, great grandsons of all

343
00:14:32,440 --> 00:14:36,600
 the Dickens, they've all somehow decided to keep Charles in there.

344
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:37,600
 Just a really, really home.

345
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:41,120
 There's a middle name in there of Charles and virtually every single one of them.

346
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:45,120
 Was Charles Dickens' sons have weird names, like Alfred Tennyson, or--

347
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:47,920
 But he used to give them really weird names, because he was kind of fun, so he nicknamed

348
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:51,800
 his kids, so his daughter was called Lucifer Box, because she had a stormy temper.

349
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:55,100
 He called one of his son's chicken stalker all his life, and one of his sons was called

350
00:14:55,100 --> 00:14:56,100
 Plorn.

351
00:14:56,100 --> 00:14:57,100
 Wasn't there Skittles as well?

352
00:14:57,100 --> 00:14:58,100
 Skittles?

353
00:14:58,100 --> 00:14:59,100
 Yeah, I think there was.

354
00:14:59,100 --> 00:15:00,100
 I didn't know those Skittles around back then.

355
00:15:00,100 --> 00:15:02,640
 There was no way to taste the rainbow.

356
00:15:02,640 --> 00:15:06,320
 The best Dickens story, I think, is when Hans Christian Andersen came to stay with him,

357
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:09,800
 and he was supposed to stay two weeks, and he stayed five.

358
00:15:09,800 --> 00:15:11,120
 And the Dickens family hated him.

359
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:12,440
 I found it complete bore.

360
00:15:12,440 --> 00:15:16,760
 And Dickens had, as soon as Chris Hans Christian Andersen left, he left in the guest room,

361
00:15:16,760 --> 00:15:21,600
 a note on the mantle piece that just said, Hans Andersen stayed in this room for five weeks,

362
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:26,680
 which seemed to the family ages, and that was erected in the guest room.

363
00:15:26,680 --> 00:15:27,680
 Oh, my God.

364
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:28,680
 Hans Andersen never knew.

365
00:15:28,680 --> 00:15:31,720
 Andersen used to write articles saying how what a great time he'd had with Dickens, now

366
00:15:31,720 --> 00:15:36,000
 close they are, and Dickens just shunned him from then on.

367
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:40,440
 Some stuff about gifts, seeing as we talked about that before.

368
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:45,580
 King World War II, obviously there wasn't much stuff around, and so women's weekly magazine

369
00:15:45,580 --> 00:15:49,040
 pointed out that anything is worth giving as a gift.

370
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:54,440
 And they said, "A box of matches now makes a very welcoming gift, and you can make it more

371
00:15:54,440 --> 00:15:59,920
 important looking by dressing the box up, by sticking a scrap of pretty wallpaper or decorative

372
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:02,720
 Christmas paper on the front and back of it."

373
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:04,720
 That's nice, though, isn't it?

374
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:05,720
 Isn't it good?

375
00:16:05,720 --> 00:16:06,720
 Yeah.

376
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:08,520
 Well, gifts I've been reading lately about.

377
00:16:08,520 --> 00:16:13,960
 I just estimate that when you give someone a gift, there's, on average, a 10 to 30% financial

378
00:16:13,960 --> 00:16:18,560
 loss that you're making, because obviously if you give someone a gift, if I give you a gift

379
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:19,560
 James, then you give me a gift.

380
00:16:19,560 --> 00:16:23,720
 And that was something I decided was too expensive to buy with my own money.

381
00:16:23,720 --> 00:16:27,800
 This isn't going to cut it at Christmas when you go to your family, and they say, "Where's

382
00:16:27,800 --> 00:16:28,800
 our gift?"

383
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:29,800
 And you go, "Economist estimates."

384
00:16:29,800 --> 00:16:30,800
 That's what I'm doing.

385
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:36,200
 They're taking into account the emotional effect of the gift, but certainly from a value

386
00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:37,200
 perspective.

387
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:38,480
 But gifts aren't worth it, guys.

388
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:43,360
 In Japan, they have an amazing gift-giving culture, where if somebody gives you a gift, you

389
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:49,320
 need to give them back a gift of half of the value of the original gift, and then the

390
00:16:49,320 --> 00:16:54,640
 original gift-giver gives a card, and that finishes the gift cycle.

391
00:16:54,640 --> 00:17:04,520
 Oh, so you kind of have to have a £5 book token on you at all times in case someone gives

392
00:17:04,520 --> 00:17:05,520
 you a £10 one.

393
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:10,400
 This is why all the candies and all of the stuff in Japan, it all comes individually wrapped,

394
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:14,440
 so you can buy a big box and give one to everybody in your office and stuff.

395
00:17:14,440 --> 00:17:16,240
 And then you have to give you half of that.

396
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:18,000
 And then you've got to get them all cards.

397
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,000
 Oh, that's terrible.

398
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:20,000
 Absolutely, hell.

399
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,720
 Also, you have to ask the really rude question when someone gives you a gift of, so how

400
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:23,720
 much was this?

401
00:17:23,720 --> 00:17:26,080
 I reckon they deduce that.

402
00:17:26,080 --> 00:17:27,400
 That's all within the soul.

403
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:28,760
 Yeah, you have to guess.

404
00:17:28,760 --> 00:17:29,760
 Majesty.

405
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:32,120
 What do you get when someone gives you a flat pack with Shelley?

406
00:17:32,120 --> 00:17:33,120
 Yeah.

407
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:38,480
 Do you remember when Barack Obama came to visit Gordon Brown, and Gordon Brown gave Barack

408
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:43,480
 Obama a pen holder carve from the timbers of the sister ship from which the White House

409
00:17:43,480 --> 00:17:44,480
 desk is made.

410
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:45,480
 Oh.

411
00:17:45,480 --> 00:17:49,200
 And the first edition of a seven-volume biography of Winston Churchill, and Barack Obama

412
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:55,600
 gave Gordon Brown a 25 DVD box set that didn't work on British DVD.

413
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:57,600
 Oh, what was it of?

414
00:17:57,600 --> 00:18:01,720
 It was just of the 25 top films of all time, and I think if I list, he'd just gone through

415
00:18:01,720 --> 00:18:02,720
 the top 25.

416
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:03,720
 Like a mixtape.

417
00:18:03,720 --> 00:18:04,720
 Yeah.

418
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:13,520
 When Donald Rumswell went to Iraq, he gave Saddam Hussein some medieval spiked hammers, and Saddam

419
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:18,120
 Hussein gave him back a video documenting Syrian atrocities.

420
00:18:18,120 --> 00:18:19,120
 Oh, wow.

421
00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:21,680
 It was people starving puppies, wasn't it?

422
00:18:21,680 --> 00:18:22,680
 Yeah.

423
00:18:22,680 --> 00:18:27,720
 There's an amazing thing online, so if an American president is given a gift, if the gift

424
00:18:27,720 --> 00:18:32,880
 is under $350 American, the president gets to keep the gift.

425
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:35,480
 If it's over that, it belongs to the people.

426
00:18:35,480 --> 00:18:38,560
 And recently they did a list of all the countries that were given in presence, and the worst

427
00:18:38,560 --> 00:18:45,040
 one they decided was from Poland, who gave Obama when he visited in 2012.

428
00:18:45,040 --> 00:18:52,240
 They gave him a computer game called Witcher 2, a DVD called Best of Witcher 2, a Witcher

429
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:57,680
 2 gift box set, three golden Witcher 2 coins, a Witcher 2 book.

430
00:18:57,680 --> 00:19:01,920
 Witcher 2 stickers and an ivory colored Witcher 2 bust of one of the characters.

431
00:19:01,920 --> 00:19:02,920
 Wow.

432
00:19:02,920 --> 00:19:03,920
 That was his present.

433
00:19:03,920 --> 00:19:06,480
 Andy, anything to add before we move on?

434
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:10,720
 Gordon Brown's presence to Barack Obama cost 10,000 pounds, and the DVDs in return were

435
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:15,440
 just, yes, the 25 best films of all time, as judged by one online firm.

436
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:21,440
 The following time that Gordon Brown had to give Barack Obama gifts, he gave him two books,

437
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:26,680
 a Carnegie anthology about the Scottish American industrialist Andrew Carnegie, and Scottish

438
00:19:26,680 --> 00:19:27,680
 estate tweeds.

439
00:19:27,680 --> 00:19:31,160
 So he kind of learned his lesson about giving the president a really good presence.

440
00:19:31,160 --> 00:19:33,520
 Okay, we should move on, guys.

441
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:41,560
 Here's another empress song.

442
00:19:41,560 --> 00:19:55,840
 Okay, that song was called Cosmos, and it's now time for fact number three.

443
00:19:55,840 --> 00:20:01,200
 James, my fight is that neuroscientists could tell if you are a musician simply by looking

444
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:02,360
 at your brain.

445
00:20:02,360 --> 00:20:03,360
 Wow.

446
00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:08,760
 So this comes from a book called Musical Failure by Oliver Sachs, it's a great book called

447
00:20:08,760 --> 00:20:14,240
 about music and the brain, and he's basically saying that, yeah, the brain just develops

448
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:17,040
 differently from people who spend their whole life playing music.

449
00:20:17,040 --> 00:20:21,920
 I think it was Oliver Sachs that said that he reckons everybody has perfect pitch as

450
00:20:21,920 --> 00:20:25,640
 a baby, but you learn to disregard it.

451
00:20:25,640 --> 00:20:30,480
 And it's only the practice of music, which keeps that up, so he argues for the fact that you

452
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:32,920
 cannot learn perfect pitch as an adult.

453
00:20:32,920 --> 00:20:36,840
 Also, as a baby, when you're two, you have more brain cells than you'll ever have again,

454
00:20:36,840 --> 00:20:37,840
 don't you?

455
00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:38,840
 Yeah, they say that.

456
00:20:38,840 --> 00:20:39,840
 So take advantage of it.

457
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:44,200
 And you can remove a large portion of the baby's brain, yeah, half and it can still function

458
00:20:44,200 --> 00:20:45,200
 as a full brain.

459
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:46,200
 Of anyone's brain, I think.

460
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:47,200
 What?

461
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:48,200
 Well, not an adult.

462
00:20:48,200 --> 00:20:50,800
 No, no, you can move half of anyone's brain and it still works as a brain.

463
00:20:50,800 --> 00:20:51,800
 Oh, that's not it.

464
00:20:51,800 --> 00:20:54,040
 I think you want to do it quite carefully.

465
00:20:54,040 --> 00:20:57,120
 Like a clean knife, yeah.

466
00:20:57,120 --> 00:21:01,720
 And so music and the brain, there's been lots of studies about that and there's been a study

467
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:07,760
 quite recently that looking at brain waves of musicians and they found that when two musicians

468
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:11,200
 play a duet, their brain waves synchronize, which is quite cool.

469
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:12,200
 Wow.

470
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:13,200
 Yeah.

471
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:16,120
 And there's another one that they looked at jazz musicians as they're improvising and

472
00:21:16,120 --> 00:21:21,360
 found out that they turned off areas linked to self-sensoring and inhibition as they do

473
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:22,360
 that.

474
00:21:22,360 --> 00:21:27,040
 And then there was another study by Harriet Walt University that looked at the kind of music

475
00:21:27,040 --> 00:21:31,600
 people liked and then gave them personality tests and found out what kind of personalities

476
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:32,600
 they had.

477
00:21:32,600 --> 00:21:38,960
 And they found that blues fans had high self-esteem, their creative, outgoing, gentle, and the tees.

478
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:49,440
 Jazz fans have high self-esteem, a creative, outgoing, at ease, classical, and the tees.

479
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:51,920
 Classical music fans have high self-esteem.

480
00:21:51,920 --> 00:21:54,920
 Their creative, abnormities.

481
00:21:54,920 --> 00:22:00,680
 And rock and indie fans have low self-esteem, are not hardworking, not gentle, and not outgoing.

482
00:22:00,680 --> 00:22:01,680
 Excellent.

483
00:22:01,680 --> 00:22:02,680
 That's ash.

484
00:22:02,680 --> 00:22:03,680
 You're fine.

485
00:22:03,680 --> 00:22:04,680
 What's up?

486
00:22:04,680 --> 00:22:08,160
 Sorry, I was just having a nap.

487
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:12,360
 Couldn't keep up with all this.

488
00:22:12,360 --> 00:22:15,840
 You can't tell amazing things from looking at people's brains, can't you?

489
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:19,680
 So it's a really reliable way to predict someone's political affiliations.

490
00:22:19,680 --> 00:22:23,440
 If you look at someone's brain function, you've got an 82, not you personally, if you're a brain

491
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:29,160
 surgeon, you've got an 82% chance of predicting someone's political affiliation, like how they

492
00:22:29,160 --> 00:22:30,160
 would actually vote.

493
00:22:30,160 --> 00:22:31,160
 That's extraordinary.

494
00:22:31,160 --> 00:22:32,160
 So would that be a public and all-democrat?

495
00:22:32,160 --> 00:22:34,520
 If they've had half the brain removed, they're a UKIP supporter.

496
00:22:34,520 --> 00:22:35,520
 Yep.

497
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:36,520
 Wow.

498
00:22:36,520 --> 00:22:37,520
 Politics.

499
00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:38,520
 Oh, my goodness.

500
00:22:38,520 --> 00:22:39,520
 It's a huge effort.

501
00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:40,520
 It's a huge effort.

502
00:22:40,520 --> 00:22:41,520
 Oh, my God.

503
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:44,400
 Another quite cool thing you can tell is you can predict if your relationship's going

504
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:45,400
 to last.

505
00:22:45,400 --> 00:22:46,400
 What?

506
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:47,400
 Yep.

507
00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:49,560
 So they looked at couples at the start of a relationship when they said they were

508
00:22:49,560 --> 00:22:53,640
 falling in love, and the couples where their brain function showed that they were suppressing

509
00:22:53,640 --> 00:22:58,720
 the area of the brain that usually is judgmental and the area of the brain that's selfish.

510
00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:02,160
 If they're more suppressed than the relationship lasts.

511
00:23:02,160 --> 00:23:06,640
 So surely, let's all, like, there needs to be an app for this, right?

512
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:08,800
 A brain scanning app, yeah, as soon as you meet someone.

513
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:09,800
 Man.

514
00:23:09,800 --> 00:23:10,800
 That's weird, isn't it?

515
00:23:10,800 --> 00:23:13,360
 It's too, it would be too scary for people to do.

516
00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:15,920
 Here's another thing that explains how little we know about the brain.

517
00:23:15,920 --> 00:23:19,520
 There was a case of a guy called Mr. B. We don't know what his real name was.

518
00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:23,920
 He had bad OCD, depression and anxiety.

519
00:23:23,920 --> 00:23:28,720
 So he had shock therapy that gave him electric shocks and to theory was that they would change

520
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:30,680
 his brain wave, so whatever.

521
00:23:30,680 --> 00:23:33,040
 So the treatment worked actually quite well.

522
00:23:33,040 --> 00:23:37,400
 His OCD went, his depression went, his anxiety went, but it had a strange side effect.

523
00:23:37,400 --> 00:23:41,520
 It turned him into the world's biggest Johnny Cash fan.

524
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:46,640
 Before the surgery, Mr. B was a casual music listener who liked Dutch music, the Beatles

525
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:51,360
 and the Rolling Stones, but after the treatment, he bought every Johnny Cash CD and DVD he

526
00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:54,560
 could get his hands on and he wouldn't listen to anything else.

527
00:23:54,560 --> 00:23:55,560
 That's amazing.

528
00:23:55,560 --> 00:23:58,320
 Okay, Andy, you got anything to add?

529
00:23:58,320 --> 00:23:59,320
 This is interesting.

530
00:23:59,320 --> 00:24:00,320
 On a perfect pitch.

531
00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:05,000
 It's also more common among blind people, for whom if you have a perfect pitch, it's more

532
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:09,240
 handy to work out whether a car is moving on which direction or footsteps, it sort of

533
00:24:09,240 --> 00:24:12,200
 gives me more of an idea of your surroundings.

534
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:15,600
 And also for people who speak other languages, because a third of the world's language is

535
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:22,920
 a tonal, and to understand, yeah, tie Vietnamese and lots of Chinese languages that you need

536
00:24:22,920 --> 00:24:25,680
 pitch to work out what someone's actually saying to you.

537
00:24:25,680 --> 00:24:32,880
 So, it's interesting that a pitch is not as powerful in our brains as rhythm and that you

538
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:36,520
 can lose through head traumas and disease and stuff.

539
00:24:36,520 --> 00:24:41,360
 You can lose your ability to differentiate pitch, but it's really, really difficult to

540
00:24:41,360 --> 00:24:46,420
 lose your idea of rhythm and your sense of rhythm.

541
00:24:46,420 --> 00:24:47,420
 That's weird.

542
00:24:47,420 --> 00:24:51,320
 Yeah, so it goes back way further, yeah.

543
00:24:51,320 --> 00:24:53,320
 Okay, we need to wrap this one up.

544
00:24:53,320 --> 00:25:02,280
 Here's another preview from the MPS album.

545
00:25:02,280 --> 00:25:13,160
 That song was called Cosmic Cat, and now it's time for the final fact of the show, and that's

546
00:25:13,160 --> 00:25:18,280
 my fact, and my fact this week is during World War II, Jack Warner, who was the head of Warner

547
00:25:18,280 --> 00:25:20,760
 Brother Studio and the founder.

548
00:25:20,760 --> 00:25:25,220
 He realized that from the air, his Hollywood studios were indistinguishable from a nearby

549
00:25:25,220 --> 00:25:30,520
 aircraft factory, and as they were worried of bombing happening at the time, he had a giant

550
00:25:30,520 --> 00:25:35,720
 arrow painted on the rooftop with the words Lockheed that away.

551
00:25:35,720 --> 00:25:39,600
 Taking that a bit further, what everyone in America should have done was painted on their

552
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:43,460
 roof white house this way, so no one got bummed apart from the white house.

553
00:25:43,460 --> 00:25:44,460
 That's true.

554
00:25:44,460 --> 00:25:46,000
 Wait, why do you want to bum the white house?

555
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:50,180
 If you're Jack Warner, you don't want people to bum your studio, so you've painted arrow

556
00:25:50,180 --> 00:25:51,180
 on it.

557
00:25:51,180 --> 00:25:52,860
 So, surely everyone should paint an arrow on their houses.

558
00:25:52,860 --> 00:25:54,360
 I'm asking them to bum the president.

559
00:25:54,360 --> 00:25:56,080
 Or just away from my house, please.

560
00:25:56,080 --> 00:26:03,080
 Yeah, exactly.

561
00:26:03,080 --> 00:26:07,520
 I saw an interview with the next head of the US military a couple of years ago.

562
00:26:07,520 --> 00:26:12,960
 I think it was on Vice Magazine, and the interviewer posed the question whether if the whole world

563
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:17,740
 got together in attack to America, whether they could land a single troop on American soil,

564
00:26:17,740 --> 00:26:19,240
 and he reckoned no.

565
00:26:19,240 --> 00:26:20,240
 Really?

566
00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:21,240
 They'd stop us before we even got to the--

567
00:26:21,240 --> 00:26:27,520
 Americans if the whole world got together, not one troop would get landed on American soil.

568
00:26:27,520 --> 00:26:28,520
 That's really funny.

569
00:26:28,520 --> 00:26:30,440
 Yeah, but surely Canada's on our side.

570
00:26:30,440 --> 00:26:31,920
 And Mexico was really close.

571
00:26:31,920 --> 00:26:32,920
 Yeah, exactly.

572
00:26:32,920 --> 00:26:36,920
 He was like South America and America, and that's-- he was like accounting for them.

573
00:26:36,920 --> 00:26:39,920
 Well, I think we should try it.

574
00:26:39,920 --> 00:26:40,920
 I'm free tomorrow.

575
00:26:40,920 --> 00:26:41,920
 Okay, let's do it.

576
00:26:41,920 --> 00:26:44,120
 Can I just say to the NSA if they're listening?

577
00:26:44,120 --> 00:26:45,960
 I don't think that's a very good idea at all.

578
00:26:45,960 --> 00:26:53,100
 And when I say if they're listening, I just with the thing of Jack Warner painting a massive

579
00:26:53,100 --> 00:26:57,480
 arrow on the roof, the thing that I liked about it, though, was the idea that if there was

580
00:26:57,480 --> 00:27:01,920
 a Japanese bomber flying over, they would look down to it and they'd be like, oh, directions.

581
00:27:01,920 --> 00:27:03,520
 And I've always wondered about directions.

582
00:27:03,520 --> 00:27:07,520
 Like how do you-- back then, how did you get flight directions if you didn't have a map

583
00:27:07,520 --> 00:27:08,520
 for the area or whatever?

584
00:27:08,520 --> 00:27:10,520
 There are big concrete arrows in America.

585
00:27:10,520 --> 00:27:13,640
 That's what-- yeah, that's an extraordinary thing that I had no idea about.

586
00:27:13,640 --> 00:27:18,600
 Yeah, the post in America, the way that they used to direct the postman, was to have these

587
00:27:18,600 --> 00:27:24,040
 huge concrete arrows slabs on the ground, and they would just bring you from the east coast

588
00:27:24,040 --> 00:27:25,640
 to the west coast and back again.

589
00:27:25,640 --> 00:27:26,640
 And so--

590
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:27,640
 Like in a plane.

591
00:27:27,640 --> 00:27:29,480
 Yeah, in a plane you'd look down at it and see an arrow going that way.

592
00:27:29,480 --> 00:27:30,720
 All right, things about roofs.

593
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:31,720
 Oh, yeah.

594
00:27:31,720 --> 00:27:36,200
 As soon as that was the point at the start, that apparently there are churches in the UK that

595
00:27:36,200 --> 00:27:40,760
 have a thing called the voice of God, which is a microphone on top of their roof, that

596
00:27:40,760 --> 00:27:46,040
 when you're trying to steal metal, steal lead from the roof, then it'll say, stop doing that

597
00:27:46,040 --> 00:27:49,520
 to a terrible person, you're going to hell, kind of thing.

598
00:27:49,520 --> 00:27:53,800
 And there seems to be a lot of news articles about people painting penises on the top of roofs.

599
00:27:53,800 --> 00:27:55,880
 I've seen at least two or three of those.

600
00:27:55,880 --> 00:27:56,880
 Yeah.

601
00:27:56,880 --> 00:27:58,680
 There was one in Hungerford in 2009.

602
00:27:58,680 --> 00:28:05,440
 A guy called Rory painted a large phallic symbol on his parents' roof.

603
00:28:05,440 --> 00:28:10,080
 And his mother, Claire, 49, said, "We don't want any more children.

604
00:28:10,080 --> 00:28:14,880
 Well, the idea of sleeping under a giant phallic symbol is rather worrying."

605
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:16,880
 She's kind of missing the point.

606
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:20,320
 I think the journalist must have pointed out to them that it was a phallic symbol, because

607
00:28:20,320 --> 00:28:21,320
 she said that.

608
00:28:21,320 --> 00:28:25,640
 And then the husband said, "We don't want to lie in bed at night and hear couples at it

609
00:28:25,640 --> 00:28:29,800
 above us," which is a really confusing quote, but I think he's implying that roundy couples

610
00:28:29,800 --> 00:28:31,000
 are going to come and go to their room.

611
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:33,480
 Oh, like they do in the sernab, but it's one.

612
00:28:33,480 --> 00:28:34,480
 Exactly, exactly.

613
00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:37,840
 But I did like that story because they only found out that he'd done it when he was

614
00:28:37,840 --> 00:28:39,480
 away on his gap year.

615
00:28:39,480 --> 00:28:42,000
 So they wrung him up, and he was in Brazil at that time.

616
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:46,080
 So he just said, "Oh, you found it then."

617
00:28:46,080 --> 00:28:49,720
 Jack Warner, just very quickly about his character, because I didn't know much about him.

618
00:28:49,720 --> 00:28:51,960
 It's one of the biggest movie studio names.

619
00:28:51,960 --> 00:28:53,680
 We all know Warner Brothers.

620
00:28:53,680 --> 00:28:57,120
 Originally, they were called One Scolaser.

621
00:28:57,120 --> 00:28:58,120
 That was their surname.

622
00:28:58,120 --> 00:29:01,720
 So it could have been One Scolaser Brothers, but they changed it to Warner.

623
00:29:01,720 --> 00:29:06,880
 They initially started as three brothers who were just getting into the movie business.

624
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:10,680
 They started the business as a result of their dad selling his gold watch and then selling

625
00:29:10,680 --> 00:29:12,360
 their horse called Bob.

626
00:29:12,360 --> 00:29:15,280
 And Jack Warner was a really interesting character, very hated.

627
00:29:15,280 --> 00:29:16,840
 He outdid all of his brothers.

628
00:29:16,840 --> 00:29:20,280
 He got them to sell their shares, saying that all of them were going to share it, and then

629
00:29:20,280 --> 00:29:25,240
 he bought them all back the next day on his own, and they never spoke to each other again.

630
00:29:25,240 --> 00:29:29,800
 Even to the point when they fell out that when his brother died, Harry died, they asked

631
00:29:29,800 --> 00:29:34,480
 the press were like, "Hey, any response," and he said, "I don't give a shit about Harry."

632
00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:35,920
 I mean, that's intense.

633
00:29:35,920 --> 00:29:40,560
 He said, "If you look at quotes of his online, all the quotes are just like one that was to

634
00:29:40,560 --> 00:29:45,040
 an actress where he said, 'You were very good playing a bitch, heroin, but you shouldn't

635
00:29:45,040 --> 00:29:46,040
 win an award for playing yourself.'"

636
00:29:46,040 --> 00:29:47,040
 That's harsh.

637
00:29:47,040 --> 00:29:54,040
 And he also apparently met Albert Einstein, and when he met Albert Einstein, he said to

638
00:29:54,040 --> 00:29:57,760
 him, "I too have a theory of relativity.

639
00:29:57,760 --> 00:29:58,760
 Don't hire them."

640
00:29:58,760 --> 00:30:03,120
 But yeah, him and his older brother, Harry, had a terrible relationship, and there was one

641
00:30:03,120 --> 00:30:09,200
 account of them, Harry running through the studio chasing Jack, wielding a lead piping,

642
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:12,080
 screaming, "I'm going to kill you," which is just so seems like it was the inspiration

643
00:30:12,080 --> 00:30:13,760
 for a lot of cartoons that followed it.

644
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:14,760
 Yeah.

645
00:30:14,760 --> 00:30:17,320
 Did a lot of people get killed by lead piping in the old days?

646
00:30:17,320 --> 00:30:19,120
 Maybe they just played Cludeau.

647
00:30:19,120 --> 00:30:22,600
 That's why Cludeau was a really insensitive game when it first came out.

648
00:30:22,600 --> 00:30:25,560
 All I know about one of brothers is they used to make cartoons.

649
00:30:25,560 --> 00:30:29,880
 Yeah, it's weird that they made all those big films, and now we associate one of brothers

650
00:30:29,880 --> 00:30:35,200
 so much with cartoons, but they made quite a lot of politically incorrect, I'm going to

651
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:36,200
 say cartoons.

652
00:30:36,200 --> 00:30:39,880
 There is a group of films called The Sensored Eleven, which are the 11 Warner Bros. films

653
00:30:39,880 --> 00:30:42,680
 which had to be suppressed from 1950's onwards.

654
00:30:42,680 --> 00:30:49,840
 Did you know when Jack Warner was young and his parents ran this movie theatre, he used

655
00:30:49,840 --> 00:30:54,920
 to be a tracer, which is somebody who would come on in between the movies and sing to clear

656
00:30:54,920 --> 00:30:55,920
 out the audience?

657
00:30:55,920 --> 00:30:56,920
 Oh, together, second audience ink.

658
00:30:56,920 --> 00:31:01,480
 Maybe that's what all his bitterness comes from, is the fact that he was employed to be a

659
00:31:01,480 --> 00:31:02,480
 sh*t thing.

660
00:31:02,480 --> 00:31:06,520
 He was, yeah, he was a Vloderville performer when he was younger and totally failed at it and

661
00:31:06,520 --> 00:31:12,360
 was really well-known at just being a bad comic and always having really bad jokes, but

662
00:31:12,360 --> 00:31:16,680
 being quite keen and trying to make people laugh or just failing.

663
00:31:16,680 --> 00:31:17,680
 Just on Warner Bros.

664
00:31:17,680 --> 00:31:18,680
 Yeah.

665
00:31:18,680 --> 00:31:20,920
 Do you know the, was Flintstone's Warner Bros. production?

666
00:31:20,920 --> 00:31:22,400
 I started looking at all the other shows.

667
00:31:22,400 --> 00:31:23,400
 Hallabarara.

668
00:31:23,400 --> 00:31:24,400
 Hallabarara wasn't it?

669
00:31:24,400 --> 00:31:25,400
 Oh yeah.

670
00:31:25,400 --> 00:31:26,400
 Oh, on Hannabarara actually.

671
00:31:26,400 --> 00:31:32,080
 Tom and Jerry the other day, the last Tom and Jerry cartoon that, um, Hannabarara directed,

672
00:31:32,080 --> 00:31:34,160
 they commit joint suicide at the end of it.

673
00:31:34,160 --> 00:31:35,160
 So what?

674
00:31:35,160 --> 00:31:40,120
 They both get dumped by their respective girlfriends and so I think Tom gets, which one is the cat?

675
00:31:40,120 --> 00:31:41,120
 Tom's the cat?

676
00:31:41,120 --> 00:31:42,120
 Tom, yeah.

677
00:31:42,120 --> 00:31:45,000
 So he gets dumped first so he's singing "Rude Pressed" and then Jerry gets dumped and they

678
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:48,200
 sit on a railway line and it ends with them sitting waiting for the train to come and mow

679
00:31:48,200 --> 00:31:49,200
 them down.

680
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:50,200
 That's so dark.

681
00:31:50,200 --> 00:31:51,200
 Yeah, it's really weird.

682
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:52,200
 They committed suicide.

683
00:31:52,200 --> 00:31:53,200
 Yeah, they did.

684
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:55,960
 Together, but it's quite sweet because they did it together, they finally...

685
00:31:55,960 --> 00:31:58,640
 So the side packs are never sweet.

686
00:31:58,640 --> 00:32:02,880
 Um, so the Flintstones used to be sponsored by Winston cigarettes and so it used to have

687
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:07,400
 adverse Winston cigarettes at the beginning in the end of it and there was a public outcry

688
00:32:07,400 --> 00:32:12,880
 about this because one of the most famous was when Fred and Barney, a sneak round the

689
00:32:12,880 --> 00:32:15,800
 back of the house, when the women are doing the house work and they sit down and have

690
00:32:15,800 --> 00:32:19,080
 a cigarette and they talk about how great it is that they're smoking these great cigarettes

691
00:32:19,080 --> 00:32:24,960
 while their wives are doing all the hard work and Fred Flintstone said, "Winston tastes

692
00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:29,880
 good like cigarettes should" and there was public outcry because that's a misuse of the

693
00:32:29,880 --> 00:32:32,280
 word "like" and it should be as cigarettes should.

694
00:32:32,280 --> 00:32:33,280
 [laughter]

695
00:32:33,280 --> 00:32:36,880
 You're pretty angry about that.

696
00:32:36,880 --> 00:32:37,880
 Wonderful.

697
00:32:37,880 --> 00:32:41,040
 Okay, Andy, anything to add?

698
00:32:41,040 --> 00:32:45,160
 On American military might, America spends more on its military than the next 15 countries

699
00:32:45,160 --> 00:32:51,260
 combined and the total amount of land area occupied by US bases and facilities is bigger than

700
00:32:51,260 --> 00:32:55,680
 Washington, D.C., Massachusetts and New Jersey combined.

701
00:32:55,680 --> 00:33:01,400
 And on Roof Pinesia, I've just found two headlines from the Metro that I want to leave you

702
00:33:01,400 --> 00:33:02,400
 with.

703
00:33:02,400 --> 00:33:08,600
 Man, surprised by massive roof penis and school surprised by 20 foot penis, so there you

704
00:33:08,600 --> 00:33:09,600
 go.

705
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:14,960
 Okay, that's it.

706
00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:15,960
 That's all of our facts.

707
00:33:15,960 --> 00:33:17,000
