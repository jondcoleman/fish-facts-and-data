00:00:00,00:00:05,"Hi everybody, Andy here. Just a couple of very quick announcements before this week's"
00:00:05,00:00:08,show starts. The first is to say who our special guest is. If you've been listening to Fish
00:00:08,00:00:12,"for a little while, you may have heard her before because she is none other than the"
00:00:12,00:00:18,"brilliant Rachel Parris. Rachel has done so many things. She's a member of Ostentatious,"
00:00:18,00:00:22,a great improvised comedy show. She's hosted The MASH Report. She's a musical comedian.
00:00:22,00:00:27,She's toured the country with her brilliant shows. She's written a book called Advice
00:00:27,00:00:30,"from Strangers. There's nothing she can't do, and as you're about to hear, she was"
00:00:30,00:00:34,"great on this show too, as she always is. The other thing to say is that we have just"
00:00:34,00:00:39,"done a live show at the London Podcast Festival. Now, the show is in the past. There's no"
00:00:39,00:00:45,"way of getting there by conventional means, but if you go to knowsuchthingasofish.com/live,"
00:00:45,00:00:50,you will be able to get a streaming ticket and watch the show in all its glory. And there
00:00:50,00:00:55,"is one extremely good reason to do that, which is that our special guest for this show is"
00:00:55,00:01:00,"none other than Anna. Anna Tijinski is back. She's come back for this show, as you will"
00:01:00,00:01:05,"hear. She was great, and you can buy the streaming tickets and see Anna's glorious fish return"
00:01:05,00:01:10,"for the next week. Tickets are available to buy until the 21st of September, so treat"
00:01:10,00:01:16,"yourself to that. Enjoy it. Knowsuchthingasofish.com/live. That's it from me, on with the show."
00:01:16,00:01:36,"Hello, and welcome to another episode of Knowsuchthingasofish, a weekly podcast this week coming to you live"
00:01:36,00:01:46,"from the Soho Theatre. My name is Dan Schreiber. I am sitting here with James Harkin, Andrew"
00:01:46,00:01:50,"Hunter Murray, and Rachel Parris. And once again, we have gathered round the microphones"
00:01:50,00:01:55,"with our four favorite facts from the last seven days, and in no particular order, here"
00:01:55,00:02:02,"we go, starting with fact number one, and that is Rachel. My fact is Viking men dyed their"
00:02:02,00:02:12,"hair blonde, wore makeup, and had grooming kits. You don't imagine them jumping off the"
00:02:12,00:02:19,"longboat with grooming kits. No. Also, I thought they were blonde already. No, some of them"
00:02:19,00:02:24,"were blonde, but there was, I think now we know there was a much greater prevalence of"
00:02:24,00:02:28,dark hair than was previously thought they weren't universally blonde. So what they did
00:02:28,00:02:34,was they used lye to bleach their hair blonde. What we can't know is their intentions. It
00:02:34,00:02:40,also was useful for cleaning it and stopping lice. So what we don't know is was it only
00:02:40,00:02:46,for cleaning or was it partly for vanity as well? But the idea of it being for vanity
00:02:46,00:02:51,seems believable because we do know they were quite vain in other areas. The English
00:02:51,00:02:55,"certainly thought that they were very vain, the Vikings. There was a monk called John"
00:02:55,00:03:01,of Wallingford who said that the Danes cheated by washing. They made themselves too acceptable
00:03:01,00:03:09,to English women by their elegant manners and their care of their person. That is cheating.
00:03:09,00:03:13,How could we possibly compete with people who wash?
00:03:13,00:03:18,"Well, that's the way it seems to be because there was a guy called Ahmed Ibn Fadlan who"
00:03:18,00:03:22,"was writing about the Vikings. He was from Baghdad, but he was probably in somewhere"
00:03:22,00:03:28,"like Constantinople or whatever, and he wrote that every day they wash with the dirtiest"
00:03:28,00:03:33,"and filthiest water there could be. They blow their nose, they spit, they do every filthy"
00:03:33,00:03:38,thing imaginable in that water and then they wash with it. So it seemed like they were
00:03:38,00:03:43,"in this kind of in between of the people in the Middle East thought they were disgusting,"
00:03:43,00:03:48,but the people in Britain thought they were absolutely artichokes.
00:03:48,00:03:53,That Arabic writer was one of the sources that he noted that they bleached their beards
00:03:53,00:03:59,"to a saffron yellow. So he really had his eye on them, didn't he? A keen eye on them."
00:03:59,00:04:05,"I'll tell you what they didn't have. Maybe. Tables. What? Yeah, exactly. Not such a catch"
00:04:05,00:04:12,"now, are they? Idiots. I think that men with tables are cheating. They must have had tables."
00:04:12,00:04:17,"What? What did they play snooker on? Well, yeah. There's a guy called Neil Price who"
00:04:17,00:04:21,"wrote a book called Children of Ash and Elm all about the Viking mind, and he's also been"
00:04:21,00:04:26,"a historical consultant on a few Viking movies. He was asked we needed to have a banquet,"
00:04:26,00:04:30,"and he said I don't know if there were tables because there's no record, there's no Viking"
00:04:30,00:04:34,"tables left over, so they just shot it cleverly to completely ignore the question of whether"
00:04:34,00:04:39,the tables existed in the Viking world or not. They must have had tables. What did they eat
00:04:39,00:04:45,"off? We don't know. The floor. This is an eminent Viking scholar, Neil Price. He's not willing"
00:04:45,00:04:49,to say. You know those little trays that have a padded cushion underneath? My wife uses
00:04:49,00:04:52,"them. On their knees? Yeah, on their knees. I actually don't know what those are. What"
00:04:52,00:04:54,"are those? It's kind of like if you're watching TV and you bring your dinner in, it's a sort"
00:04:54,00:04:58,of like little cushion and it's got a table on top of it. It makes so much sense that
00:04:58,00:05:04,Andy doesn't even know what we're talking about. A tray on the lap. I know what a tray
00:05:04,00:05:11,"is, I know what a lap is. Is your wife 95 years old then? What is this? There was a Viking"
00:05:11,00:05:17,"called Lot the Unwashed, and that's more evidence that perhaps they were very clean because"
00:05:17,00:05:22,why would they call him unwashed if it wasn't for the fact that everyone else washed normally.
00:05:22,00:05:30,Andy was described as a wise man and much given to manslaughter. There's also a theory
00:05:30,00:05:36,"that they loved orange cats. So they loved cats anyway, which is quite an amazing thing."
00:05:36,00:05:42,"Every sort of expedition, they go on expeditions, every pillage that they went on, they would"
00:05:42,00:05:47,"bring cats with them, and they brought cats for a number of reasons. A, they loved them."
00:05:47,00:05:50,"B, for any vermin that was on the boats, they could get rid of the mice and stop spreading"
00:05:50,00:05:55,"disease, but the cats would escape once they get to these lands that they were going to."
00:05:55,00:05:59,So there's been studies where they've looked at the DNA of a bunch of cats from that period
00:05:59,00:06:03,"that they found the bones of and so on, and they've discovered that it was basically just"
00:06:03,00:06:07,"the Vikings just dropping cats off in all these places. Were they orange cats, or had"
00:06:07,00:06:15,"they died the cats with lye? They were immaculately brushed. On terms of how clean they were, or"
00:06:15,00:06:19,"how dirty they were, we thought we knew for ages how clean they were because there are"
00:06:19,00:06:26,churches in England which have Viking skin nailed to the doors. What? Macabre? At least
00:06:26,00:06:31,four of them. They're called Daneskins. And I think the idea is that the churches made
00:06:31,00:06:34,"themselves look really hard by saying, you know, the Vikings came here and this is what"
00:06:34,00:06:39,"they left behind. This is, you know, we saw them off. Anyway, they've tested them and"
00:06:39,00:06:46,they're almost all cow or donkey. It's weird that because the thing we were talking
00:06:46,00:06:51,"before about how they had brown hair, a lot of them, we know that through DNA tests. And"
00:06:51,00:06:56,"they've also checked it with modern day people. And they found that in the UK, each of us"
00:06:56,00:07:02,"in the UK on average has got about 6% Viking DNA, but also that when they've looked at"
00:07:02,00:07:06,"people who were buried in Scotland, they found a lot of people who were buried as if they're"
00:07:06,00:07:12,"Vikings, but didn't have any Viking DNA in them. And so they just kind of like self identified"
00:07:12,00:07:17,"as Vikings. And they just decided, well, even though I don't have any Viking heritage,"
00:07:17,00:07:20,I'm just going to be a Viking now. And they went with all of the culture and all of the
00:07:20,00:07:26,"everything. Wow. That's pretty cool, isn't it? Yeah, that is cool. Cosplay. Cosplay. Very,"
00:07:26,00:07:31,very early cosplay. When the people are still there. I'm going to say uncontroversially
00:07:31,00:07:41,"that self identifying is not the same as cosplay. Oh, shit. Yeah. Thanks, Andy. Well, we've had"
00:07:41,00:08:00,"nine years of fun. Can I tell you more about the grooming? Oh, yeah, yeah. The facial"
00:08:00,00:08:06,grooming. So they had quite a lot of different beauty tools. And this was this was men and
00:08:06,00:08:12,"women alike, including razors and tweezers. And as we've mentioned, combs. But they also"
00:08:12,00:08:19,"had ear spoons, which I like. Yeah. So they knew kind of before we did that is not a good"
00:08:19,00:08:26,idea to shove something in your ear and compact it. So they had little tiny ear scoops to scoop
00:08:26,00:08:31,"the wax out. They have that in Mongolia as well. Yeah. So a buddy of ours, Craig Glenday,"
00:08:31,00:08:36,"Guinness World Records editor-in-chief, he went to Mongolia to meet the tallest man"
00:08:36,00:08:40,"in the world. He was there to verify him as the tallest man. And when you go to a house,"
00:08:40,00:08:44,"he said, went to the house. And he said, before you come in, here's your spoon for your ears."
00:08:44,00:08:47,And you've got to clean your ears before you go into the house. Yes. Like take your shoes
00:08:47,00:08:51,"off, clean your ears. I've got quite a few ear spoons. Do you? Yeah. Yeah. I got one that"
00:08:51,00:08:58,"lights up. It's kind of cool. Okay. Hang on. How do you, how do you sit? How do you know?"
00:08:58,00:09:11,Is it? It comes out of your eyes. Just shut. Yeah. No. Yeah. So there was a thing in Japan
00:09:11,00:09:16,"quite a few years ago, which was this kind of trend of like young people would spoon"
00:09:16,00:09:23,"each other's ears. What? I've said it before and I was like, again, what a generation is"
00:09:23,00:09:30,Zed up to. This is before then I reckon it's quite a lot many years ago. Right. And there
00:09:30,00:09:35,was like this trend of selling ear spoons in Japan. And I bought some because we're going
00:09:35,00:09:39,to talk about it on QI. Okay. I just thought it would be kind of a cool thing to have.
00:09:39,00:09:43,"What are they used for? It's, it's just right. You, you're getting bits of wax out of your"
00:09:43,00:09:47,"ears, right? Yeah. This is someone else. If you, if you could do it yourself, but isn't"
00:09:47,00:09:51,it nicer if you just have someone lay their head on your lap and you just kind of spoon
00:09:51,00:09:56,"out the ear? Oh, wow. I feel like I've lost the room. No, no, no. I think, I think we're"
00:09:56,00:09:59,"all fascinated. I want to know like if you're scared of like, because a lot of people have"
00:09:59,00:10:03,a phobia about their ears. Do you get to do that fun helicopter thing? The airplane's
00:10:03,00:10:10,going to come around here. But for the ear? It's coming in. Yeah. I don't know my vehicles
00:10:10,00:10:18,at all. Choo choo. Here comes the helicopter. Do you want to know where the last Viking
00:10:18,00:10:28,"attack on UK soil was? Well, obviously 10th century 2021 2021. This happened in a Scottish"
00:10:28,00:10:32,town called Kirk could bright. And it was when a replica longboat for a display knocked
00:10:32,00:10:38,out the power supplies when it got tangled in an overhead power line. The local energy
00:10:38,00:10:44,network said only one customer had been affected. And the reenactment groups maritime officer
00:10:44,00:10:49,apologized for the inconvenience and said we are incredibly sorry for the disruption.
00:10:49,00:10:55,I think that is the last time I think I found some more legit modern Vikings than cosplay
00:10:55,00:11:01,"ones, which is Iceland has an elite police force. And they are known as the Viking squad."
00:11:01,00:11:04,That's their sort of unofficial name. They're technically the special unit of the National
00:11:04,00:11:10,Police Commissioner. There's only about 46 of them in total. And but the problem was
00:11:10,00:11:15,it's not a problem rather there's no sort of official standard military in Iceland.
00:11:15,00:11:23,"So it defaults to them. So if ever Iceland gets involved in a war, the Vikings are coming."
00:11:23,00:11:32,Viking squad 46 will be sent in. What would you say to me and the if I said ergy agar
00:11:32,00:11:36,"rager that I don't know what I'd say. I mean, I'd saying what I would say, which is direct"
00:11:36,00:11:41,with baffle man and mild upset. That's fair enough. What is it? Is it like a Viking question?
00:11:41,00:11:48,"It's more like a Viking insult, actually. Classic James turned up trying to do the good"
00:11:48,00:11:53,research. I'm just getting insults. What is it? It's calling someone a coward in various
00:11:53,00:11:57,different ways. But the interesting thing is these swear words were so derogatory that
00:11:57,00:12:00,"if someone called them to you, according to Icelandic law, at least, you're allowed to"
00:12:00,00:12:07,kill them without paying any compensation. Just from any of these insulting words. Those
00:12:07,00:12:14,was it three? Ergy agar rager. You just compounded the offense. I've got to do it twice now.
00:12:14,00:12:21,"I got a quiz question for you guys. Okay, so they was once a Viking called Sigurd, the"
00:12:21,00:12:26,"mighty, and he was killed by something that was attached to the side of him as he was"
00:12:26,00:12:34,"riding on a horse. Okay, so he has a sword there and the horse flips him up and the sword"
00:12:34,00:12:40,"stabs him in the leg and severs an artery. I'll go with not a sword, but a cheese knife."
00:12:40,00:12:46,Ah. It was a posh Viking. He was on his way to a tasting. He was very excited about it.
00:12:46,00:12:53,"I feel like it's not going to be swordy because it seems too obvious. Yeah, cool. Boots. Boots."
00:12:53,00:13:04,"Yeah, no. So the answer is it was the decapitated head of male breaker who was a sworn enemy"
00:13:04,00:13:09,"of Sigurd. Okay. He had killed, taken his head off his body, strapped it to the saddle"
00:13:09,00:13:16,"of his horse, and as he was riding, the tooth of his enemy scratched his leg and it got"
00:13:16,00:13:24,"infected and it killed him. This is the rumour. I'm not sure if it's 1200 years old, whether"
00:13:24,00:13:28,"it's a rumour anymore, as in a rumour is kind of one level up from gossip. And I wouldn't"
00:13:28,00:13:32,"say this is gossip. You know, this is kind of, you hear what happened to Sigurd, the mighty."
00:13:32,00:13:36,"Oh my God. I thought that was hot gossip. Dan just heard this like from his neighbour,"
00:13:36,00:13:41,who heard it from a friend. I think we just start presenting all of our facts as rumours
00:13:41,00:13:53,"and hot gossip. It is time for fact number two, and that is James. Okay, my fact this"
00:13:53,00:13:59,week is that the fourth president of the United States once sent the third president of the
00:13:59,00:14:04,United States a letter giving the precise measurement between a weasel's anus and its
00:14:04,00:14:12,"vulva. That actually is hot gossip. That's exciting, sexy gossip. That's Heat magazine's"
00:14:12,00:14:17,"circle of shame. It would be better if they called it the weasel's vulva, rather the circle"
00:14:17,00:14:22,"of shame. That's a better name for it. So what's going, what's going on? Well, just"
00:14:22,00:14:27,"what I said, that's what happened for sure. But this was basically, we're talking Thomas"
00:14:27,00:14:34,"Jefferson, your third president, and he was in an argument with a French nobleman called"
00:14:34,00:14:41,"George Louis Leclerc Buffon. Buffon had never been to America, but he had a theory that"
00:14:41,00:14:47,"America had just come out of the ocean, and it hadn't dried out yet. And so it, all the"
00:14:47,00:14:50,"animals and the plants were really struggling to live there, and they were all like really"
00:14:50,00:14:57,"small and weedy. Now he told that to Jefferson, and Jefferson was not very happy about it."
00:14:57,00:15:02,"And so he decided that he was going to prove him wrong. And so he sent his friends, one"
00:15:02,00:15:06,"of whom was James Madison, who was the fourth president, to measure as many animals as they"
00:15:06,00:15:11,"could. And so what they did is they went out, found a load of American animals, including"
00:15:11,00:15:17,"a weasel, and sent back all the precise measurements of all these animals. And one of them was the"
00:15:17,00:15:22,"distance, which I explained earlier. Yeah. And he was, he was so pissed off that this"
00:15:22,00:15:28,"guy had said this because he, the insinuation was if any European animals went over there,"
00:15:28,00:15:32,they would sort of regress once they were there and just sort of shrivel and get smaller
00:15:32,00:15:35,as the generations went on. But the implication was also that American people would be like
00:15:35,00:15:40,that as well. So that American people would be much more small and insipid than Europeans.
00:15:40,00:15:45,And why? Because it was damp. Because it was damp. Because it was. I'm going to say as
00:15:45,00:15:50,"well, as someone from the north, just because it's damp. Bufont, who was a brilliant guy,"
00:15:50,00:15:54,"I'm hoping to talk about him in a bit, but he was an amazing guy. But he claimed that"
00:15:54,00:15:58,"anywhere in North America, if you dug down by two feet, the ground would be frozen. He"
00:15:58,00:16:03,"was incorrect about this. He was hugely incorrect about it. But it basically, there was this"
00:16:03,00:16:08,theory which they referred to as New World Degeneracy. Kind of the idea was lots of old
00:16:08,00:16:15,"European countries, they're more aristocratically run. America was, it liked to think of itself"
00:16:15,00:16:19,as being founded on more egalitarian lines or more democratic lines and not needing a
00:16:19,00:16:26,"nobility class. And so they wanted to find scientific underpinning for that, that America"
00:16:26,00:16:31,was a kind of- Did they want to kind of cast aspersions on it so that people weren't attracted
00:16:31,00:16:36,"to going there? I think this guy was just a bit of a curious cookie, right? He sort of"
00:16:36,00:16:39,had lots of theories before. He had lots of theories about the age of the earth. He just
00:16:39,00:16:43,was building up these theories. And it's just so great that Jefferson was so pissed off.
00:16:43,00:16:47,"And there was a lot going on at this time. And he was like, I need measurements of animals"
00:16:47,00:16:52,and all these guys who are about to change America are suddenly out there measuring Weasel's
00:16:52,00:16:58,"anus' devolvers. The report came back and he presented it to Buffon and he said, look"
00:16:58,00:17:04,"at it, our bears are 410 pounds. Yours are 153 here in Europe. We've got 12 pound otters."
00:17:04,00:17:08,"Your otters are terrible compared to our otters. All this sort of stuff. And he was like, and"
00:17:08,00:17:12,"don't get me started on the moose. Our moose are massive. And he's like, Buffon was like,"
00:17:12,00:17:15,"you kind of massive moose over there, surely not. He was like, mate, it's huge. Our moose"
00:17:15,00:17:19,"are so big, your reindeers walk under them. That's how big they are. And he didn't believe"
00:17:19,00:17:24,"him. So then Jefferson writes back to the guys again and says, send me a fucking moose."
00:17:24,00:17:30,And they have to go out and find a moose and send it. And they do. They did. Yeah. And
00:17:30,00:17:34,"it was rubbish when it turned up because it had been taken months to find it, dry it,"
00:17:34,00:17:37,"skin it, debone it, whatever you do with the moose, you know, you had to. I have a lot"
00:17:37,00:17:45,"of questions about how they measured the animals. Did they anesthetize them? And if so, did"
00:17:45,00:17:51,they have anaesthetic? I'm afraid they might have not always been alive. The animals by
00:17:51,00:17:56,"the time they were, yeah, especially the weasels. I feel very naive. Yeah. I'm like, how did"
00:17:56,00:18:02,they hold them nicely and safely while they measured from their anus to their vulva? And
00:18:02,00:18:06,"a weasel as well, which will be quite, quite fidgety. That I have to say, you've just brought"
00:18:06,00:18:11,"up a great time travel destination point. Imagine going back in history, landing and"
00:18:11,00:18:16,"watch Madison measuring the anus to vulva, the weasel. The other thing is Madison was"
00:18:16,00:18:20,"famously very slight, wasn't he? Oh, yeah. He's really, really smallest president there"
00:18:20,00:18:26,"was. He was five. Are you about to speculate on the distance, but from the anus? Oh, wow."
00:18:26,00:18:29,Is that where you're going? I wasn't going to go there. All right. My mistake. He could
00:18:29,00:18:34,overpower a weasel. He could walk underneath a moose. Interesting. But it would have been
00:18:34,00:18:39,"funnier to see him wrestling with a weasel than a blinker, for instance, who's a big"
00:18:39,00:18:43,"man, I would say. That's true. James Madison was five foot four and he weighed just under"
00:18:43,00:18:48,"a hundred pounds. It's about the same as Mila Kunis when she was in black swan, if that"
00:18:48,00:18:55,helps. It does help. Small. Small. Yeah. Was he maybe the shortest president? He was the
00:18:55,00:18:58,"shortest, but quite a bit. It's about a few inches. Yeah. Although he sounds like a great"
00:18:58,00:19:03,"guy too. Oh, yeah. I mean, all these people sound like really interesting guys. Yeah. May"
00:19:03,00:19:10,"I tell you something about more about Jefferson's letters? Oh, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So in 1787,"
00:19:10,00:19:16,"the same Thomas Jefferson wrote a letter to Peter Carr, his nephew, but he said, if you"
00:19:16,00:19:21,"don't get married, do have affairs with women. Oh no. Oh my God. Sorry. I'm getting my facts"
00:19:21,00:19:25,mixed up. Hang on. No. Can I erase that on the tape? Who's doing the tape? The gossip
00:19:25,00:19:33,"is about to turn to slander. Right. Benjamin Franklin, not Jefferson. Benjamin Franklin,"
00:19:33,00:19:38,"advised a young man to have sex with older women, not younger women. Okay. And he really"
00:19:38,00:19:47,set out all of the reasons why. Okay. Better conversation. More. I hope someone's going
00:19:47,00:19:57,"to worry for all of these. More even tempered. Yeah. Rather darkly, no risk of children accidentally."
00:19:57,00:20:04,Okay. More sexually experienced. You'll love this if there's any older women in the crowd.
00:20:04,00:20:11,"I am loving this one. He said, you might as well because if covering all above with a"
00:20:11,00:20:16,"basket and regarding only what is below the girdle, it's impossible of two women to know"
00:20:16,00:20:24,an old one from a young one. Wow. Covering all above with a basket. Yeah. And his final
00:20:24,00:20:31,"reason was that eighthly and lastly, they're so grateful. Wow. Thanks, Ben Franklin. Well,"
00:20:31,00:20:39,you can see why I married my 90 year old wife now. Wasn't just for the pillow table. Wow.
00:20:39,00:20:45,That's quite something. Franklin. Yeah. Yeah. Wow. Who's got a basket that big? Like a laundry
00:20:45,00:20:50,basket. I imagined a laundry basket. Oh yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I could probably fit
00:20:50,00:20:57,"myself, my entire self in my laundry basket. Sorry. I'm boastful. I'd have to tuck, but"
00:20:57,00:21:08,"tuck myself up. Sorry, just for the take. Jesus Christ. We're all here, Andy. We can"
00:21:08,00:21:14,all hear what you're saying. I refuse to believe that. Can I talk about either Madison or
00:21:14,00:21:22,Buffon? Please talk about anything else. Okay. Let's talk about just a couple more things
00:21:22,00:21:26,on Madison because we were talking about before. He was a very significant president who gets
00:21:26,00:21:29,"kind of a bit overlooked because he was what fourth in the running orders. So, you know,"
00:21:29,00:21:33,"everyone knows about George Washington and John Adams and blah, blah, blah. Madison was"
00:21:33,00:21:38,"president during the War of 1812, which is when the British invaded and torched the White"
00:21:38,00:21:43,House. Yeah. And he had to flee at the time. He was actually in residence at the time.
00:21:43,00:21:48,"He was the last person alive who signed the Constitution, which is quite something for"
00:21:48,00:21:54,"some years. And he died in 1836. He was 85 years old at the time. And it was late June,"
00:21:54,00:21:59,"right? Late June, he's dying. He's 85. And his doctor says, you know what we could do?"
00:21:59,00:22:04,"We could give you some crazy drugs that will keep you alive until the 4th of July, which"
00:22:04,00:22:09,"is Independence Day. Oh yeah. Because at that point, three previous presidents had all died"
00:22:09,00:22:14,"on the 4th of July. And the doctor basically said, want to make it four? We can, you know..."
00:22:14,00:22:17,"Yeah, yeah. Did he not think, why don't you just keep giving me those crazy drugs for"
00:22:17,00:22:22,"longer than that? Well, yes, that is a really good point. I think they were kind of very"
00:22:22,00:22:26,"last resort. Yeah, they were. Stimulus things. And he, to his great credit, said, you know"
00:22:26,00:22:31,"what, I'm okay. When I die, I die. And he died on the 28th of June. Yeah. But his doctor"
00:22:31,00:22:36,"was the same one who took care of Jefferson, who did die on the 4th of July. So maybe they"
00:22:36,00:22:39,"missed that. Well, I don't know. Yeah, they might have done it better as well. I tell you"
00:22:39,00:22:43,"the thing, because I think this relates to what you took about Jefferson that I accidentally"
00:22:43,00:22:49,"started earlier. Oh yeah. And this is about Thomas Jefferson now. In 1787, he was writing"
00:22:49,00:22:53,"to his nephew. And I just found it interesting what you're talking about, signing the Constitution"
00:22:53,00:22:57,"and what Americans think of themselves, and that Jefferson was actually pretty much a"
00:22:57,00:23:07,"skeptic, really interrogated the Bible, and believed in constantly questioning what said"
00:23:07,00:23:12,"in the Bible, you know, and he said, ""Shake off all the fears and servile prejudices under"
00:23:12,00:23:17,"which weak minds are servilely crouched."" In other words, saying that his nephew shouldn't"
00:23:17,00:23:21,"be afraid to question the text of the Bible. And he even questioned the existence of God,"
00:23:21,00:23:26,"saying, ""Question with boldness even the existence of a God, because if there be one, he must"
00:23:26,00:23:31,"approve of the homage of reason rather than that blindfolded fear."" So that's quite"
00:23:31,00:23:36,"cool. Yeah. And thirdly, get yourself a really big wicker basket, and that's what we're"
00:23:36,00:23:42,"going to do with that. Buffon did that as well, didn't he? He was, they're all enlightenment"
00:23:42,00:23:46,"people, weren't they? And they were questioning what was in the Bible and stuff like that."
00:23:46,00:23:50,"Buffon was kind of the Aristotle of his day, in that he hoovered up a huge amount of information"
00:23:50,00:23:56,"and turned it into, I think it was 44 volumes, the work he produced. It was absolutely mega."
00:23:56,00:24:01,"There's another experiment he did. He wanted to see how old the Earth was at the time,"
00:24:01,00:24:05,quite controversial to say it would be more than several thousand years old. So he heated
00:24:05,00:24:10,"up balls of iron until they were white hot, right? And then he saw how long they took"
00:24:10,00:24:15,"to cool down, and then he just scaled up to the size of the Earth and said, ""Well, that"
00:24:15,00:24:20,"must be how long the Earth took to cool down after it was a ball of molten iron."" It's"
00:24:20,00:24:28,"a good idea. He assessed 75,000 years, obviously flat wrong, but privately, privately he thought"
00:24:28,00:24:32,"it was more like three million, which is also still several orders of magnitude wrong. But"
00:24:32,00:24:40,he's getting there. It's getting closer. And he partly went with the lower number because
00:24:40,00:24:43,"he thought it would be more acceptable to the church, and he had to preface it with"
00:24:43,00:24:47,"an introduction saying, ""Obviously, this is just a crazy thought experiment I've done."""
00:24:47,00:24:51,He was still doing the work. The important thing is that he was questioning these things
00:24:51,00:24:53,"that have been passed down, all those things."
00:24:53,00:24:59,"It sounds like Pliny saying Aristotle, but yeah, he's got an encyclopedia of plans."
00:24:59,00:25:01,"Pliny's the one I meant. Sorry, Pliny's the one I meant."
00:25:01,00:25:04,"Oh, Pliny is the one that you meant. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Just sort of like, I reckon if"
00:25:04,00:25:11,"I'd lived in that time, even with the kind of modern day intelligence that I have, please."
00:25:11,00:25:18,"What's the end of that sentence? Well, I definitely would have been like, he's right."
00:25:18,00:25:23,"Yeah. Are you saying, if you were teleported back"
00:25:23,00:25:28,"now, having done this podcast for nine years, and we've talked about Pliny and how wrong"
00:25:28,00:25:34,"he was about everything, like how women have four teeth and all these mad claims he made,"
00:25:34,00:25:41,"you'd be like, ""Cool, sounds legit. Okay. I think you could be Pliny. I would dethrone"
00:25:41,00:25:46,"Pliny if I were you. If you end up in this crazy situation, I would do it."""
00:25:46,00:25:51,"He also, like, it's really weird because he was very obsessed with how American animals"
00:25:51,00:25:55,"were very, not superior. Just wanted to make the point that they were not weak."
00:25:55,00:25:58,"So this is Jefferson. Sorry, back to Jefferson, that there were"
00:25:58,00:26:03,"bigger animals. The author was bigger and so on. But he did also love European animals,"
00:26:03,00:26:07,"and he brought dogs back to Virginia, a shepherd dog. And interestingly, it's a kind of dog"
00:26:07,00:26:13,that historians can't quite agree on of what it was. So he was in Paris. He went out miles
00:26:13,00:26:18,"into a storm one night to try and find one, because he'd heard rumors of where one was."
00:26:18,00:26:22,"And he eventually found a pregnant one, and he brought it back to Virginia. And he was"
00:26:22,00:26:26,"so excited, and he was breeding these dogs. And then something, and again, it's slightly"
00:26:26,00:26:30,"murky, what happened, just went wrong. And he got rid of the dogs, and he had all his"
00:26:30,00:26:36,"dogs executed, and he just turned into someone who hated dogs for the rest of his life."
00:26:36,00:26:39,"Executed is a strong word. Well, it's the right word."
00:26:39,00:26:44,"The vet doesn't come in and say, ""I'm going to have to execute your dog."" Sorry."
00:26:44,00:26:49,We've assembled the firing squad. I'm sorry I didn't fluff it up for you.
00:26:49,00:26:54,"And then what happened is, he had all of them move to a farm where they had wonderful lives."
00:26:54,00:26:58,"Of course we'll blindfold your goldfish, Mrs Prescott."
00:27:05,00:27:10,"Okay, it is time for fact number three, and that is my fact. My fact this week is that"
00:27:10,00:27:17,"during the Second World War, Steinway parachuted pianos into battlefields. So this was a morale"
00:27:17,00:27:23,"thing where they thought, ""We need to make this a bit more cheery, this whole World War"
00:27:23,00:27:30,"II thing."" And why not get a bunch of, because music is such a great thing to raise spirits"
00:27:30,00:27:34,"and so on. And at this point, Steinway was put under restrictions by the government because"
00:27:34,00:27:39,"they couldn't use lots of medals. And so during the war effort, they were making coffins,"
00:27:39,00:27:43,"unfortunately, but they were also making random bits and pieces. And then they hit upon the"
00:27:43,00:27:49,"idea of making a portable piano, a tall standing piano, that they could just parachute out"
00:27:49,00:27:55,"of planes into battlefields. And 3,000 were dropped off over the course of the war, landed"
00:27:55,00:27:59,safely. And there's so many stories of these pianos being played by the troops as they
00:27:59,00:28:04,"were gathering around and stuff. It's a lovely idea, but you know that some assholes banging"
00:28:04,00:28:10,out Wonderwall at 3 a.m. It's always that guy.
00:28:10,00:28:16,"Yeah, so they were known as victory verticals and they weren't just used for parachuting"
00:28:16,00:28:21,"into the battlefield. They were put into submarines as well, which is a really interesting thing"
00:28:21,00:28:26,"because in order to get them into a submarine, you need the submarine not to be shut first"
00:28:26,00:28:28,"as in entirely encased, right?"
00:28:28,00:28:29,Not build.
00:28:29,00:28:33,"Yeah, it's like during the building process, you have to put it in. And so once they're"
00:28:33,00:28:37,"in, they're stuck in there. And going forward just a bit, there is a ship which is called"
00:28:37,00:28:44,"the USS Thomas Edison, which is the only submarine rather, which has an actual Steinway,"
00:28:44,00:28:49,"like a proper grand piano style Steinway, and they can't take it out. It was in there"
00:28:49,00:28:50,for 22 years.
00:28:50,00:28:55,Imagine being on a submarine with a guy who's brought his grade one book. I'm going to be
00:28:55,00:29:01,learning actually for the next nine months. These are victory verticals. They just sound
00:29:01,00:29:06,"so cool. And they're so interesting. They were painted. Oh, DGI, Olive Drab, government"
00:29:06,00:29:11,"issue because they were painted dark green. And they could, they had no legs because that"
00:29:11,00:29:15,might not survive the parachute drop. And the history of Steinway during the war is
00:29:15,00:29:19,"so mad because Steinway was a German American company. Founders were German, still had a"
00:29:19,00:29:25,"factory in Germany, had a factory in New York as well. And both sides demanded different"
00:29:25,00:29:32,"things of Steinway. So in Germany, they were suspected of being a Jewish company, and they"
00:29:32,00:29:36,"had to deny that and, you know, sort of prove that they weren't. And in America, they were"
00:29:36,00:29:39,suspected of being Nazis because they were called Steinway. So they had this terrible
00:29:39,00:29:43,"time and they had to hang American flags all over their buildings, kind of show that we"
00:29:43,00:29:47,"are, you know, we're patriotic. And this is the weird thing. Both separate halves of"
00:29:47,00:29:52,"the company made planes, wooden planes for the war effort for the side they were in."
00:29:52,00:29:59,"Oh, my God. German Steinways were making decoy planes to be bombed. The American Steinways"
00:29:59,00:30:04,"were making gliders, which were real planes, but they were wood. They were very light and"
00:30:04,00:30:09,"feels like both sides could have gotten together and just said, you know what, let's just cross"
00:30:09,00:30:14,this line out of the exactly just like completely disregard this. Yeah. And so they made these
00:30:14,00:30:18,incredibly powerful gliders because gliders were an incredibly amazing tool for getting
00:30:18,00:30:23,"past enemy defenses and landing soldiers. Right. So the first one they built, they tested,"
00:30:23,00:30:27,they loaded it with a ton of stuff and then it got towed behind another plane because
00:30:27,00:30:31,that's how you get a glider somewhere. It got towed three and a half thousand miles
00:30:31,00:30:34,from Montreal to Britain in one day. And this was just the test flight to see if the gliders
00:30:34,00:30:40,"worked and it contained vaccines for Russia, military equipment for the free French parts"
00:30:40,00:30:45,for some bomber planes and a bunch of bananas for the pilot's family in London. Very sweet.
00:30:45,00:30:49,"Yeah. They made, they made over a thousand during the war. These gliders, the American"
00:30:49,00:30:53,"Steinways. Yeah. That's amazing. Very weird. These pianos, obviously, because it's a war,"
00:30:53,00:30:57,"you don't have all of the stuff that you can normally make pianos out of, right? So they"
00:30:57,00:31:02,"use a lot less metal that you get in a normal piano. Instead of the copper strings, they"
00:31:02,00:31:06,"use soft iron strings. Instead of ivory keys that they couldn't get, they use celluloid."
00:31:06,00:31:13,"And the thing is with celluloid is if you bang it, it explodes, which must have been, you"
00:31:13,00:31:18,"know, if you're really doing a proper rack-running off sort of slam on your keys, it takes a"
00:31:18,00:31:23,whole new meaning to a banger on the piano. Do you know the White House has a Steinway?
00:31:23,00:31:30,"Did they? Yeah. And it is tiny. It's about, it's like this big. What? It's a really tiny"
00:31:30,00:31:36,"Steinway. It's a, wait, we should say for the people at home, you were doing like a sort"
00:31:36,00:31:41,"of six inch high. Yeah. I, do you know what I am? Then what it looked like a massive idiot."
00:31:41,00:31:45,"You know, when you have a scale, and I just can't remember how to pronounce the scale,"
00:31:45,00:31:50,"but it's one piano scale. No, not the piano scale, the size scale. So it's one, one,"
00:31:50,00:31:55,"two, to seven. Yeah. So it's one to seven. So it's a seven to size. Yeah. Exactly. That's"
00:31:55,00:32:01,a good way of saying it. So it's a seven to the size of a proper Steinway. And you nearly
00:32:01,00:32:05,"look like an idiot there, Dan, but you sort of sweat. That's bigger than that then. Um,"
00:32:05,00:32:09,"because the Steinway is massive. So couple of feet, couple of feet each way. Yeah. Maybe."
00:32:09,00:32:13,"Yeah. Again, I was doing the hand size, knowing that the audience at home couldn't see what"
00:32:13,00:32:17,"I was doing. So who was it? Who was it for? Well, it's for the White House. And it's a"
00:32:17,00:32:22,"replica of a, of a Steinway that they did actually have and which has now been moved"
00:32:22,00:32:29,"into a museum. So this guy who's an artist who created it, spent 16 years basically conceiving,"
00:32:29,00:32:34,"creating, building it and making sure that it functions exactly like a Steinway of regular"
00:32:34,00:32:39,"size. And even to the point, this is how sort of obsessed he was about doing it, that when"
00:32:39,00:32:43,"he was making the actual pieces themselves, because there's so many pieces, there's something"
00:32:43,00:32:49,"like 12,000 pieces that go into a Steinway. He even made tiny versions of the machines"
00:32:49,00:32:55,that make the bigger pieces to then make the tiny pieces from in order to produce the Steinway.
00:32:55,00:33:01,"You're looking very skeptical here. Rachel, at some point, you have to ask why? Yeah."
00:33:01,00:33:06,Why not just make a Steinway? It's easier to play. Yeah. You'd have to play this one
00:33:06,00:33:10,"with little chopstick fingers, you know, with little like sticks. Oh, that'd be great though."
00:33:10,00:33:15,"When you played the chopsticks. Yeah. Yeah. No, that's, that exists. That is fascinating."
00:33:15,00:33:20,"You know, think, you know that thing of getting your piano dropped on your head? In cartoons."
00:33:20,00:33:23,In cartoons. Yeah. There is a place in the world where that happens for real every year.
00:33:23,00:33:29,"What? What do you mean? So MIT, the American University, they have a tradition every year,"
00:33:29,00:33:33,"the piano drop, where they drop a piano off the roof. But not onto someone's head. Yes,"
00:33:33,00:33:39,"onto someone's head. It's whoever comes last in the class each year. You'd say executed,"
00:33:39,00:33:44,"I guess, by, no, they don't. They're really, really careful about, obviously. But since"
00:33:44,00:33:48,"1972, they had this broken piano. They wanted to get rid of it somehow. It's just a bunch"
00:33:48,00:33:51,of students at this point. And they wanted to push it out of their window because that
00:33:51,00:33:55,would be crazy and fun for their students. And then they read the rules and they found
00:33:55,00:33:59,"out, oh, you can't, you can't throw things out of your window. But then, because they're"
00:33:59,00:34:03,"students, they read the rules really closely, they found out there's no rule against pushing"
00:34:03,00:34:07,"it off the roof. Just out of your window, that's not allowed. But off the roof, not"
00:34:07,00:34:12,"in the rules. So they did it. And half a century on now, they are still doing it. And they're"
00:34:12,00:34:16,"very tight on security and they, you know, everyone closes their windows and they in"
00:34:16,00:34:20,fact do even more than that in terms of security. Yeah. And sometimes they fill it with sweets
00:34:20,00:34:26,"or confetti. Yeah. They stopped during COVID, didn't they? And then they started again last"
00:34:26,00:34:28,year. I guess the piano was full of COVID.
00:34:28,00:34:36,They filled it with sweets like a sort of pinionioata. There we go. Pianionianata. It
00:34:36,00:34:38,almost works. It almost works.
00:34:38,00:34:42,We should say it's always a broken piano. It's never them just trashing a functioning piano.
00:34:42,00:34:45,"It's always a broken piano that can't be mended. Okay. Yeah, yeah."
00:34:45,00:34:49,"This is kind of a common thing in America, isn't it? Or relatively common. Not as common"
00:34:49,00:34:50,as McDonald's.
00:34:50,00:34:53,"What, chugging pianos off a roof?"
00:34:53,00:34:57,"Yeah, dropping pianos. You kind of, once you start googling it, you're like, well, this"
00:34:57,00:35:01,happens way more often than I thought. So the first one I think that I found anyway
00:35:01,00:35:06,was in 1968. And what happened was there were two musicians and they were driving a van
00:35:06,00:35:11,and there was a piano in the back of it and the piano actually accidentally fell out and
00:35:11,00:35:15,"they thought it kind of made quite a nice sound. And they thought, well, what if we did"
00:35:15,00:35:20,that but we dropped it from a helicopter? It'll make an even better sound. And so as
00:35:20,00:35:26,"a benefit for a radio station that they decided to drop this piano from a helicopter. And yeah,"
00:35:26,00:35:31,"they did it. And they got 3,000 people there. They all paid to watch. At one stage, a dog"
00:35:31,00:35:38,ran directly underneath the piano and sort of yapped around and the guy on the microphone
00:35:38,00:35:43,said asked everyone to whistle. And so everyone in the area whistled and then the dog sort
00:35:43,00:35:45,"of went, oh, what's that? And ran off again."
00:35:45,00:35:46,"Yeah, okay."
00:35:46,00:35:50,Don't know how that works. But that's what happened. And they dropped the piano and it
00:35:50,00:35:54,made a big old noise but not nearly as nice a noise as they wanted. Turned out that it
00:35:54,00:35:56,"didn't sound that good, but they made a lot of money anyway."
00:35:56,00:36:05,"That sounds like something men would do, doesn't it? I don't want a stereotype. So they dropped"
00:36:05,00:36:11,"it a tiny amount and it made a magical sound. And then instead of going, that was nice, let's"
00:36:11,00:36:15,"do that again or do something really creative, they were like, let's drop it from a fucking"
00:36:15,00:36:20,helicopter so that it does a massive smash. And of course that doesn't make as good a
00:36:20,00:36:21,sound.
00:36:21,00:36:32,"I was just thinking, I wonder if we could do that."
00:36:32,00:36:36,We do need to move on to our final fact. It is time for our final fact of the show and
00:36:36,00:36:38,that is Andy.
00:36:38,00:36:44,"My fact is that when filming E.T., Steven Spielberg kept E.T.'s puppeteers on the clock at lunch"
00:36:44,00:36:50,time so that six-year-old Drew Barrymore could eat with him so she kept believing he was real.
00:36:50,00:36:56,It's such a nice fact. She asked for a scarf for him to keep him warm because he's got
00:36:56,00:37:01,this very thin neck as an E.E.T. And actually they did adjust it. They adjusted the whole
00:37:01,00:37:06,"filming for the children. They shot the film in chronological order, in order of the script,"
00:37:06,00:37:10,"which never happens because you're saving money here and you shoot these two scenes here,"
00:37:10,00:37:15,but it meant the children really believed it more. They were going back into the same
00:37:15,00:37:18,world day after day. So it is kind of magical what they did.
00:37:18,00:37:22,So I watched a bunch of interviews this morning. Drew Barrymore has her own chat show and there
00:37:22,00:37:27,was the 40th anniversary of E.T. not too long ago and so all the cast members came back
00:37:27,00:37:31,"on to chat about it. And so she kept saying, you know, I knew it was definitely a fake"
00:37:31,00:37:37,"thing and they were all going, absolutely. So what the thing was is that she was, during"
00:37:37,00:37:41,"the breaks, during lunch, they'd sort of go, where's Drew? And Drew would just be sitting"
00:37:41,00:37:46,"there just going, so what do you think about, and she was just chatting to this static model"
00:37:46,00:37:51,"that was sitting there. And so the mother, who I believe her real name's Dee Dee, she"
00:37:51,00:37:56,"went over to Steven Spielberg and said, I think she really believes that he's real."
00:37:56,00:38:00,We should possibly do something about that. So Steven then hired two people who were part
00:38:00,00:38:05,of the animatronic side. That was their job to basically sit there and just have the eyes
00:38:05,00:38:10,"roll whenever she said an anecdote and stuff like that. And she keeps denying it, but every"
00:38:10,00:38:15,"single cast member says, no, you flat out believed that E.T. was real when you were five,"
00:38:15,00:38:19,"six, however she was. And he was amazing. I've got it. So my sons and I have just started"
00:38:19,00:38:23,"watching it again because they've just discovered it and you can buy these toys at the moment,"
00:38:23,00:38:29,which is so just a reminder of what E.T. looks like for everyone. E.T. it is. That's James
00:38:29,00:38:36,"Jesus. What? Have you even seen E.T.? Have you seen the movie? Maybe. Well, does that"
00:38:36,00:38:43,know what happens? Deliberately winding people up. Deliberately winding down up. I have seen
00:38:43,00:38:46,"E.T. I've watched it when it first came out when I was about three or four years old, I"
00:38:46,00:38:51,think. Nice. Right. So I don't remember anything about it. I believed it was all real. Yeah.
00:38:51,00:38:56,He looked so real and that's the thing. The animatronic side of things were extraordinary.
00:38:56,00:39:02,"So if E.T. was static, just standing and doing the scene, there was like 120 different things"
00:39:02,00:39:07,"that could happen to E.T. in that point. If he was using his hands, there was a woman"
00:39:07,00:39:13,who was a mime who would be laying underneath E.T. who had E.T. glove hands on and she would
00:39:13,00:39:17,be doing all the movements while someone else was doing the voices and so on. Then you had
00:39:17,00:39:25,three actors. One was a child who didn't have any legs. He was part of the main cast. He
00:39:25,00:39:30,"became their best friends. When E.T. is walking through the kitchen, he was the one who, walking"
00:39:30,00:39:35,"on his hands inside the E.T. suit, was slamming into the fridge and falling over and stuff."
00:39:35,00:39:38,Really? Yeah. So there were so many different elements
00:39:38,00:39:43,that went into this one character. Do you know that the company that could have made E.T.
00:39:43,00:39:49,"was Columbia, right? And they said no to it. Okay. Like idiots. Why? Because it was the"
00:39:49,00:39:54,"biggest film of all time. Did they say no? Oh, sorry, sorry. They ran surveys on it and"
00:39:54,00:39:59,"the marketing department said, ""It's got limited commercial appeal."" I know. And so it went"
00:39:59,00:40:02,"to Universal, right? And then Columbia had originally worked on it. So they got I think"
00:40:02,00:40:07,"5% of the net profits. One executive from Columbia said that year, the year it came out, they"
00:40:07,00:40:13,made more money on E.T. where they got 5% of the net profits than on any of their own
00:40:13,00:40:19,"actual films. It was so huge. It really was. It was absolutely, it was monstrous, you know."
00:40:19,00:40:24,Which is bad because Spielberg's massive at this point. He's just made Indiana Jones.
00:40:24,00:40:27,He's made Indiana Jones. He's made Close Encounters of a Third Kind.
00:40:27,00:40:30,"Yes, he's made a load of bits. He's made, yeah, Jaws. Like the guy is, the guy is."
00:40:30,00:40:35,This was meant to be his small film in between big films. And then it turns into the biggest
00:40:35,00:40:39,"film he's ever made. Speaking of, Harrison Ford was in E.T."
00:40:39,00:40:47,"Was he? Yeah, he got cut. But they filmed it. He was, he was Elliot's principal, school"
00:40:47,00:40:51,principal. And it ended up on the cutting room floor.
00:40:51,00:40:56,"That's ballsy directing as well. That's why Spielberg's a genius. Oh, thank you, Harrison."
00:40:56,00:41:00,It hasn't really worked. Why did he cut him? I guess he was too famous for what?
00:41:00,00:41:03,"For time, I suppose. And when you think about the story, like it must have been a bit of"
00:41:03,00:41:06,an offshoot of the story. What would be mega distracting to see Indiana
00:41:06,00:41:09,"Jones in the middle of the E.T. film? Yeah, it's post Indiana Jones, right?"
00:41:09,00:41:13,"Yeah, yeah. It was, it was the next film. So it would be odd, yeah."
00:41:13,00:41:14,"It would be, it would be really weird. Yeah, yeah."
00:41:14,00:41:18,"Because Henry Thomas, who's the kid who plays Elliot, which if, just for anyone here and"
00:41:18,00:41:22,"anyone listening, if you haven't seen it, there is a clip online of him auditioning for"
00:41:22,00:41:26,"the role of Elliot. It's one of the most heartwarming things ever, right?"
00:41:26,00:41:29,"So awful and sad and beautiful. Yeah, it's when the, it's when the military"
00:41:29,00:41:34,are coming to try and take E.T. away from him. So you've just got a shot of him crying
00:41:34,00:41:37,"going, but I don't want to give him up. He's mine. It's really touching, really, really"
00:41:37,00:41:41,"touching. And it's the best bit at the end where you just hear Spielberg off screen go,"
00:41:41,00:41:44,"you got the job, kid. It's just, it's wonderful in that moment."
00:41:44,00:41:48,That's the thing that got it. But he arrived for his audition with a bullwhip because he
00:41:48,00:41:51,loved Indiana Jones so much. So he came as Indiana Jones.
00:41:51,00:41:54,"And he didn't, he didn't ever try to attack E.T. with it though."
00:41:54,00:42:00,"Yeah. Yeah, no, I saw, I was reading a biography of Spielberg and I got, there's an interpretation"
00:42:00,00:42:03,"of E.T., which I might just share with you all if that's all right. There's a scientist"
00:42:03,00:42:07,"who becomes friends with E.T., if you remember that. And, and, sorry, a friend of Elliot's"
00:42:07,00:42:11,"and helps E.T. to get home. And all the way through the film, he has a bunch of keys hanging"
00:42:11,00:42:14,"from his belt, right? That's a sort of key detail of him."
00:42:14,00:42:18,And also Elliot's parents are divorced and it's a film about loneliness and being a child
00:42:18,00:42:22,"and, you know, being alone and finding a friend. And it's really, it's really touching. And"
00:42:22,00:42:26,"Spielberg himself was from his, his parents got divorced. So it was kind of about himself"
00:42:26,00:42:30,"as a child, very moving stuff. This is the interpretation from a critic called Andrew"
00:42:30,00:42:37,Saris about the scientist who befriends Elliot. Spielberg in the final sequence subtly implies
00:42:37,00:42:42,a romantic pairing of keys. That's the scientist with Elliot's mother. And he puts them in
00:42:42,00:42:45,"shots together, but he doesn't spell it out. He doesn't have any dialogue. It just shows"
00:42:45,00:42:48,them together and lets you draw your own implications.
00:42:48,00:42:53,"Saris then writes, ""Only children and Freudians can make the crucial connections between the"
00:42:53,00:42:59,telltale keys fondled near the crotch of the potential father figure and the displaced
00:42:59,00:43:06,"phallus represented by E.T. himself."" Actually, looking at a model of E.T. here, I can't"
00:43:06,00:43:08,"see that, I think. Blimey, James."
00:43:08,00:43:18,"I think you need to see a doctor, buddy. Yeah, isn't that the most insane thing you've ever"
00:43:18,00:43:19,heard?
00:43:19,00:43:20,Yeah.
00:43:20,00:43:21,Yeah.
00:43:21,00:43:27,I need to think about this. Are they suggesting the keys are like unlocking something?
00:43:27,00:43:28,"I think that might be the, yeah."
00:43:28,00:43:29,Is that what it is?
00:43:29,00:43:30,Okay.
00:43:30,00:43:34,"Well, I think the keys are the penis, but also E.T. is the penis."
00:43:34,00:43:35,It's the penis.
00:43:35,00:43:38,"But that's what I mean. If the keys can't be the penis, can they? If E.T. is the penis?"
00:43:38,00:43:41,"Well, I think for Freudians, a lot of it is the penis."
00:43:41,00:43:46,"Do you see what I mean? If I was back in time, I'm immediately bored into this Freudian"
00:43:46,00:43:47,thing.
00:43:47,00:43:49,"I think you're crowded with the Agora in ancient Greece. I say, ""Sorry, what's the E.T. thing"
00:43:49,00:43:51,"again?"""
00:43:51,00:43:58,"Drew Barrymore. I'm a massive fan of Drew Barrymore's, and she comes from a dynasty"
00:43:58,00:44:03,of actors and producers and so on. She even Spielberg is her godfather. It's that kind
00:44:03,00:44:04,"of thing, right?"
00:44:04,00:44:09,And there's a story about her grandfather who was called John Barrymore. And when he
00:44:09,00:44:16,"died, he used to play poker with a lot of other actors. Earl Flynn, who was the Aussie"
00:44:16,00:44:22,"turned American actor, a swashbuckling guy. W.C. Fields seemed to be one of the greatest"
00:44:22,00:44:27,silent comedians of all time. And there was another person who was seen as an anarchist
00:44:27,00:44:34,"that was their group, the four of them. Earl Flynn went to the morgue, stole John Barrymore,"
00:44:34,00:44:37,"brought him to the house, and they all had one last game of poker together."
00:44:37,00:44:38,No.
00:44:38,00:44:41,"Yeah, David Niven writes about this in his book, and Drew Barrymore was asked about"
00:44:41,00:44:45,"it, and she confirmed that within the family that this absolutely is true. So they brought"
00:44:45,00:44:49,"him there, sat him at the table at Dead John Barrymore. They played their game of poker,"
00:44:49,00:44:53,and then they returned him to the morgue when they were done. And Drew says she's even heard
00:44:53,00:44:59,rumours that the movie Weekend of Bernies is based on the kidnapping of the dead body
00:44:59,00:45:00,of John Barrymore.
00:45:00,00:45:01,Wow.
00:45:01,00:45:02,"Yeah, pretty cool, eh?"
00:45:02,00:45:03,Good fact.
00:45:03,00:45:10,"I'd say if I die, I would love to be on one final episode of No Such Thing as a Fish."
00:45:10,00:45:13,You'll be there ongoing. We'll just have you permanently.
00:45:13,00:45:14,"Yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:45:14,00:45:15,Just sat there.
00:45:15,00:45:17,"Yeah, the listeners won't notice the difference."
00:45:17,00:45:19,"No, no, exactly."
00:45:19,00:45:26,"The Voice of E.T., I find that interesting. This was a woman called Pat Welsh. She'd been"
00:45:26,00:45:33,"on a safari, and her photos had gotten mixed up with someone. And eventually, 20 years later,"
00:45:33,00:45:37,"she got the film back, and she went to get it developed. And when she was getting it"
00:45:37,00:45:41,"developed, she started speaking to the guy. And one of the people who was there was Ben"
00:45:41,00:45:47,"Burt, who was the sound engineer. And he heard her voice and went, ""You would be perfect"
00:45:47,00:45:49,"for my alien."""
00:45:49,00:45:53,And she'd done a little bit of stuff before. She'd been like a soap opera actress on the
00:45:53,00:45:56,"radio and stuff, but she hadn't really done very much. But she just had the perfect..."
00:45:56,00:46:03,"She'd smoked a lot of shit. That kind of... Yeah, exactly. But he took that, but he also"
00:46:03,00:46:09,"added an extra load of stuff. So he took her voice, but added some raccoons, some sea otters,"
00:46:09,00:46:16,"some horses, and a burp from his old cinema professor from USC. Oh, and his wife breathing"
00:46:16,00:46:21,when she had a cold. So he took all these things and mixed them together with her voice
00:46:21,00:46:22,to make the E.T. Voice.
00:46:22,00:46:28,So cool. There's a great story that I heard recently. I was really lucky. I met a hero
00:46:28,00:46:33,"recently, Dan Aykroyd, and he was telling me that when he was doing Temple of Doom,"
00:46:33,00:46:36,because Dan Aykroyd is in Temple of Doom.
00:46:36,00:46:37,What?
00:46:37,00:46:38,"Yeah, in Indiana Jones' Temple of Doom."
00:46:38,00:46:39,"He plays the ball, doesn't he? The big ball."
00:46:39,00:46:44,"That's Raiders, but yeah, it's no worries."
00:46:44,00:46:50,"So it's an uncredited role in the movie, but you'll all remember the scene, possibly, at"
00:46:50,00:46:55,the very beginning of Temple of Doom. There's the big fight with Lao Chi inside the Chinese
00:46:55,00:46:56,restaurant.
00:46:56,00:46:57,"The nightclub, yeah."
00:46:57,00:47:01,"And in order to get away, they go into a small plane, and he closes the door and he says,"
00:47:01,00:47:04,"""Nice try, Lao Chi,"" and he closes the door and it says Lao Chi's name on it, so you"
00:47:04,00:47:09,know he's in trouble. Someone is talking to him to get him into the plane as they're
00:47:09,00:47:14,"walking down the runway. That is Dan Aykroyd. So when you watch that again, it's Dan Aykroyd."
00:47:14,00:47:18,"So he was on set with them, and he needed to get back to the set of Ghostbusters, which"
00:47:18,00:47:21,"they were filming at the time. So he said, ""Steven, I'm going to head off."" He needed"
00:47:21,00:47:26,"to get there quick. He saw a bicycle just hanging around, gets the bicycle, it's got"
00:47:26,00:47:27,a basket and the fries.
00:47:27,00:47:28,It goes up.
00:47:28,00:47:31,"And he flew in the sky. No, Andy!"
