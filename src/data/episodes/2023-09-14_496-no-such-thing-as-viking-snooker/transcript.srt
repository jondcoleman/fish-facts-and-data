00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,020
 Hi everybody, Andy here. Just a couple of very quick announcements before this week's

2
00:00:05,020 --> 00:00:08,840
 show starts. The first is to say who our special guest is. If you've been listening to Fish

3
00:00:08,840 --> 00:00:12,240
 for a little while, you may have heard her before because she is none other than the

4
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:18,440
 brilliant Rachel Parris. Rachel has done so many things. She's a member of Ostentatious,

5
00:00:18,440 --> 00:00:22,960
 a great improvised comedy show. She's hosted The MASH Report. She's a musical comedian.

6
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:27,000
 She's toured the country with her brilliant shows. She's written a book called Advice

7
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,560
 from Strangers. There's nothing she can't do, and as you're about to hear, she was

8
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:34,240
 great on this show too, as she always is. The other thing to say is that we have just

9
00:00:34,240 --> 00:00:39,200
 done a live show at the London Podcast Festival. Now, the show is in the past. There's no

10
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:45,520
 way of getting there by conventional means, but if you go to knowsuchthingasofish.com/live,

11
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:50,440
 you will be able to get a streaming ticket and watch the show in all its glory. And there

12
00:00:50,440 --> 00:00:55,080
 is one extremely good reason to do that, which is that our special guest for this show is

13
00:00:55,080 --> 00:01:00,600
 none other than Anna. Anna Tijinski is back. She's come back for this show, as you will

14
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:05,920
 hear. She was great, and you can buy the streaming tickets and see Anna's glorious fish return

15
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:10,400
 for the next week. Tickets are available to buy until the 21st of September, so treat

16
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:16,200
 yourself to that. Enjoy it. Knowsuchthingasofish.com/live. That's it from me, on with the show.

17
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:36,720
 Hello, and welcome to another episode of Knowsuchthingasofish, a weekly podcast this week coming to you live

18
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:46,080
 from the Soho Theatre. My name is Dan Schreiber. I am sitting here with James Harkin, Andrew

19
00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:50,640
 Hunter Murray, and Rachel Parris. And once again, we have gathered round the microphones

20
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:55,200
 with our four favorite facts from the last seven days, and in no particular order, here

21
00:01:55,200 --> 00:02:02,880
 we go, starting with fact number one, and that is Rachel. My fact is Viking men dyed their

22
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:12,800
 hair blonde, wore makeup, and had grooming kits. You don't imagine them jumping off the

23
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:19,880
 longboat with grooming kits. No. Also, I thought they were blonde already. No, some of them

24
00:02:19,880 --> 00:02:24,480
 were blonde, but there was, I think now we know there was a much greater prevalence of

25
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:28,520
 dark hair than was previously thought they weren't universally blonde. So what they did

26
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:34,480
 was they used lye to bleach their hair blonde. What we can't know is their intentions. It

27
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:40,000
 also was useful for cleaning it and stopping lice. So what we don't know is was it only

28
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:46,440
 for cleaning or was it partly for vanity as well? But the idea of it being for vanity

29
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:51,680
 seems believable because we do know they were quite vain in other areas. The English

30
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:55,920
 certainly thought that they were very vain, the Vikings. There was a monk called John

31
00:02:55,920 --> 00:03:01,880
 of Wallingford who said that the Danes cheated by washing. They made themselves too acceptable

32
00:03:01,880 --> 00:03:09,440
 to English women by their elegant manners and their care of their person. That is cheating.

33
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:13,120
 How could we possibly compete with people who wash?

34
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:18,800
 Well, that's the way it seems to be because there was a guy called Ahmed Ibn Fadlan who

35
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:22,640
 was writing about the Vikings. He was from Baghdad, but he was probably in somewhere

36
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:28,040
 like Constantinople or whatever, and he wrote that every day they wash with the dirtiest

37
00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:33,120
 and filthiest water there could be. They blow their nose, they spit, they do every filthy

38
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:38,280
 thing imaginable in that water and then they wash with it. So it seemed like they were

39
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:43,040
 in this kind of in between of the people in the Middle East thought they were disgusting,

40
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:48,000
 but the people in Britain thought they were absolutely artichokes.

41
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:53,080
 That Arabic writer was one of the sources that he noted that they bleached their beards

42
00:03:53,080 --> 00:03:59,320
 to a saffron yellow. So he really had his eye on them, didn't he? A keen eye on them.

43
00:03:59,320 --> 00:04:05,560
 I'll tell you what they didn't have. Maybe. Tables. What? Yeah, exactly. Not such a catch

44
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:12,760
 now, are they? Idiots. I think that men with tables are cheating. They must have had tables.

45
00:04:12,760 --> 00:04:17,240
 What? What did they play snooker on? Well, yeah. There's a guy called Neil Price who

46
00:04:17,240 --> 00:04:21,480
 wrote a book called Children of Ash and Elm all about the Viking mind, and he's also been

47
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:26,760
 a historical consultant on a few Viking movies. He was asked we needed to have a banquet,

48
00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:30,640
 and he said I don't know if there were tables because there's no record, there's no Viking

49
00:04:30,640 --> 00:04:34,840
 tables left over, so they just shot it cleverly to completely ignore the question of whether

50
00:04:34,840 --> 00:04:39,400
 the tables existed in the Viking world or not. They must have had tables. What did they eat

51
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:45,200
 off? We don't know. The floor. This is an eminent Viking scholar, Neil Price. He's not willing

52
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:49,320
 to say. You know those little trays that have a padded cushion underneath? My wife uses

53
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:52,200
 them. On their knees? Yeah, on their knees. I actually don't know what those are. What

54
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:54,720
 are those? It's kind of like if you're watching TV and you bring your dinner in, it's a sort

55
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:58,560
 of like little cushion and it's got a table on top of it. It makes so much sense that

56
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:04,880
 Andy doesn't even know what we're talking about. A tray on the lap. I know what a tray

57
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:11,520
 is, I know what a lap is. Is your wife 95 years old then? What is this? There was a Viking

58
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:17,560
 called Lot the Unwashed, and that's more evidence that perhaps they were very clean because

59
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:22,880
 why would they call him unwashed if it wasn't for the fact that everyone else washed normally.

60
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:30,240
 Andy was described as a wise man and much given to manslaughter. There's also a theory

61
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:36,960
 that they loved orange cats. So they loved cats anyway, which is quite an amazing thing.

62
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:42,640
 Every sort of expedition, they go on expeditions, every pillage that they went on, they would

63
00:05:42,640 --> 00:05:47,040
 bring cats with them, and they brought cats for a number of reasons. A, they loved them.

64
00:05:47,040 --> 00:05:50,800
 B, for any vermin that was on the boats, they could get rid of the mice and stop spreading

65
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:55,760
 disease, but the cats would escape once they get to these lands that they were going to.

66
00:05:55,760 --> 00:05:59,880
 So there's been studies where they've looked at the DNA of a bunch of cats from that period

67
00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:03,520
 that they found the bones of and so on, and they've discovered that it was basically just

68
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:07,640
 the Vikings just dropping cats off in all these places. Were they orange cats, or had

69
00:06:07,640 --> 00:06:15,200
 they died the cats with lye? They were immaculately brushed. On terms of how clean they were, or

70
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:19,200
 how dirty they were, we thought we knew for ages how clean they were because there are

71
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:26,920
 churches in England which have Viking skin nailed to the doors. What? Macabre? At least

72
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:31,000
 four of them. They're called Daneskins. And I think the idea is that the churches made

73
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:34,400
 themselves look really hard by saying, you know, the Vikings came here and this is what

74
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:39,080
 they left behind. This is, you know, we saw them off. Anyway, they've tested them and

75
00:06:39,080 --> 00:06:46,080
 they're almost all cow or donkey. It's weird that because the thing we were talking

76
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:51,480
 before about how they had brown hair, a lot of them, we know that through DNA tests. And

77
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:56,600
 they've also checked it with modern day people. And they found that in the UK, each of us

78
00:06:56,600 --> 00:07:02,880
 in the UK on average has got about 6% Viking DNA, but also that when they've looked at

79
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:06,960
 people who were buried in Scotland, they found a lot of people who were buried as if they're

80
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:12,380
 Vikings, but didn't have any Viking DNA in them. And so they just kind of like self identified

81
00:07:12,380 --> 00:07:17,160
 as Vikings. And they just decided, well, even though I don't have any Viking heritage,

82
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:20,560
 I'm just going to be a Viking now. And they went with all of the culture and all of the

83
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:26,560
 everything. Wow. That's pretty cool, isn't it? Yeah, that is cool. Cosplay. Cosplay. Very,

84
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:31,560
 very early cosplay. When the people are still there. I'm going to say uncontroversially

85
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:41,480
 that self identifying is not the same as cosplay. Oh, shit. Yeah. Thanks, Andy. Well, we've had

86
00:07:41,480 --> 00:08:00,500
 nine years of fun. Can I tell you more about the grooming? Oh, yeah, yeah. The facial

87
00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:06,660
 grooming. So they had quite a lot of different beauty tools. And this was this was men and

88
00:08:06,660 --> 00:08:12,680
 women alike, including razors and tweezers. And as we've mentioned, combs. But they also

89
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:19,320
 had ear spoons, which I like. Yeah. So they knew kind of before we did that is not a good

90
00:08:19,320 --> 00:08:26,160
 idea to shove something in your ear and compact it. So they had little tiny ear scoops to scoop

91
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:31,600
 the wax out. They have that in Mongolia as well. Yeah. So a buddy of ours, Craig Glenday,

92
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:36,160
 Guinness World Records editor-in-chief, he went to Mongolia to meet the tallest man

93
00:08:36,160 --> 00:08:40,380
 in the world. He was there to verify him as the tallest man. And when you go to a house,

94
00:08:40,380 --> 00:08:44,300
 he said, went to the house. And he said, before you come in, here's your spoon for your ears.

95
00:08:44,300 --> 00:08:47,820
 And you've got to clean your ears before you go into the house. Yes. Like take your shoes

96
00:08:47,820 --> 00:08:51,780
 off, clean your ears. I've got quite a few ear spoons. Do you? Yeah. Yeah. I got one that

97
00:08:51,780 --> 00:08:58,660
 lights up. It's kind of cool. Okay. Hang on. How do you, how do you sit? How do you know?

98
00:08:58,660 --> 00:09:11,000
 Is it? It comes out of your eyes. Just shut. Yeah. No. Yeah. So there was a thing in Japan

99
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:16,520
 quite a few years ago, which was this kind of trend of like young people would spoon

100
00:09:16,520 --> 00:09:23,920
 each other's ears. What? I've said it before and I was like, again, what a generation is

101
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:30,220
 Zed up to. This is before then I reckon it's quite a lot many years ago. Right. And there

102
00:09:30,220 --> 00:09:35,380
 was like this trend of selling ear spoons in Japan. And I bought some because we're going

103
00:09:35,380 --> 00:09:39,020
 to talk about it on QI. Okay. I just thought it would be kind of a cool thing to have.

104
00:09:39,020 --> 00:09:43,020
 What are they used for? It's, it's just right. You, you're getting bits of wax out of your

105
00:09:43,020 --> 00:09:47,540
 ears, right? Yeah. This is someone else. If you, if you could do it yourself, but isn't

106
00:09:47,540 --> 00:09:51,660
 it nicer if you just have someone lay their head on your lap and you just kind of spoon

107
00:09:51,660 --> 00:09:56,080
 out the ear? Oh, wow. I feel like I've lost the room. No, no, no. I think, I think we're

108
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:59,400
 all fascinated. I want to know like if you're scared of like, because a lot of people have

109
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:03,800
 a phobia about their ears. Do you get to do that fun helicopter thing? The airplane's

110
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:10,560
 going to come around here. But for the ear? It's coming in. Yeah. I don't know my vehicles

111
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:18,680
 at all. Choo choo. Here comes the helicopter. Do you want to know where the last Viking

112
00:10:18,680 --> 00:10:28,180
 attack on UK soil was? Well, obviously 10th century 2021 2021. This happened in a Scottish

113
00:10:28,180 --> 00:10:32,740
 town called Kirk could bright. And it was when a replica longboat for a display knocked

114
00:10:32,740 --> 00:10:38,140
 out the power supplies when it got tangled in an overhead power line. The local energy

115
00:10:38,140 --> 00:10:44,620
 network said only one customer had been affected. And the reenactment groups maritime officer

116
00:10:44,620 --> 00:10:49,740
 apologized for the inconvenience and said we are incredibly sorry for the disruption.

117
00:10:49,740 --> 00:10:55,280
 I think that is the last time I think I found some more legit modern Vikings than cosplay

118
00:10:55,280 --> 00:11:01,180
 ones, which is Iceland has an elite police force. And they are known as the Viking squad.

119
00:11:01,180 --> 00:11:04,840
 That's their sort of unofficial name. They're technically the special unit of the National

120
00:11:04,840 --> 00:11:10,980
 Police Commissioner. There's only about 46 of them in total. And but the problem was

121
00:11:10,980 --> 00:11:15,500
 it's not a problem rather there's no sort of official standard military in Iceland.

122
00:11:15,500 --> 00:11:23,580
 So it defaults to them. So if ever Iceland gets involved in a war, the Vikings are coming.

123
00:11:23,580 --> 00:11:32,080
 Viking squad 46 will be sent in. What would you say to me and the if I said ergy agar

124
00:11:32,080 --> 00:11:36,940
 rager that I don't know what I'd say. I mean, I'd saying what I would say, which is direct

125
00:11:36,940 --> 00:11:41,920
 with baffle man and mild upset. That's fair enough. What is it? Is it like a Viking question?

126
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:48,240
 It's more like a Viking insult, actually. Classic James turned up trying to do the good

127
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:53,000
 research. I'm just getting insults. What is it? It's calling someone a coward in various

128
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:57,160
 different ways. But the interesting thing is these swear words were so derogatory that

129
00:11:57,160 --> 00:12:00,900
 if someone called them to you, according to Icelandic law, at least, you're allowed to

130
00:12:00,900 --> 00:12:07,480
 kill them without paying any compensation. Just from any of these insulting words. Those

131
00:12:07,480 --> 00:12:14,280
 was it three? Ergy agar rager. You just compounded the offense. I've got to do it twice now.

132
00:12:14,280 --> 00:12:21,200
 I got a quiz question for you guys. Okay, so they was once a Viking called Sigurd, the

133
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:26,440
 mighty, and he was killed by something that was attached to the side of him as he was

134
00:12:26,440 --> 00:12:34,300
 riding on a horse. Okay, so he has a sword there and the horse flips him up and the sword

135
00:12:34,300 --> 00:12:40,060
 stabs him in the leg and severs an artery. I'll go with not a sword, but a cheese knife.

136
00:12:40,060 --> 00:12:46,180
 Ah. It was a posh Viking. He was on his way to a tasting. He was very excited about it.

137
00:12:46,180 --> 00:12:53,940
 I feel like it's not going to be swordy because it seems too obvious. Yeah, cool. Boots. Boots.

138
00:12:53,940 --> 00:13:04,160
 Yeah, no. So the answer is it was the decapitated head of male breaker who was a sworn enemy

139
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:09,520
 of Sigurd. Okay. He had killed, taken his head off his body, strapped it to the saddle

140
00:13:09,520 --> 00:13:16,920
 of his horse, and as he was riding, the tooth of his enemy scratched his leg and it got

141
00:13:16,920 --> 00:13:24,260
 infected and it killed him. This is the rumour. I'm not sure if it's 1200 years old, whether

142
00:13:24,260 --> 00:13:28,340
 it's a rumour anymore, as in a rumour is kind of one level up from gossip. And I wouldn't

143
00:13:28,340 --> 00:13:32,020
 say this is gossip. You know, this is kind of, you hear what happened to Sigurd, the mighty.

144
00:13:32,020 --> 00:13:36,580
 Oh my God. I thought that was hot gossip. Dan just heard this like from his neighbour,

145
00:13:36,580 --> 00:13:41,420
 who heard it from a friend. I think we just start presenting all of our facts as rumours

146
00:13:41,420 --> 00:13:53,080
 and hot gossip. It is time for fact number two, and that is James. Okay, my fact this

147
00:13:53,080 --> 00:13:59,000
 week is that the fourth president of the United States once sent the third president of the

148
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:04,920
 United States a letter giving the precise measurement between a weasel's anus and its

149
00:14:04,920 --> 00:14:12,260
 vulva. That actually is hot gossip. That's exciting, sexy gossip. That's Heat magazine's

150
00:14:12,260 --> 00:14:17,760
 circle of shame. It would be better if they called it the weasel's vulva, rather the circle

151
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:22,500
 of shame. That's a better name for it. So what's going, what's going on? Well, just

152
00:14:22,500 --> 00:14:27,840
 what I said, that's what happened for sure. But this was basically, we're talking Thomas

153
00:14:27,840 --> 00:14:34,740
 Jefferson, your third president, and he was in an argument with a French nobleman called

154
00:14:34,740 --> 00:14:41,520
 George Louis Leclerc Buffon. Buffon had never been to America, but he had a theory that

155
00:14:41,520 --> 00:14:47,520
 America had just come out of the ocean, and it hadn't dried out yet. And so it, all the

156
00:14:47,520 --> 00:14:50,920
 animals and the plants were really struggling to live there, and they were all like really

157
00:14:50,920 --> 00:14:57,200
 small and weedy. Now he told that to Jefferson, and Jefferson was not very happy about it.

158
00:14:57,200 --> 00:15:02,200
 And so he decided that he was going to prove him wrong. And so he sent his friends, one

159
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:06,700
 of whom was James Madison, who was the fourth president, to measure as many animals as they

160
00:15:06,700 --> 00:15:11,100
 could. And so what they did is they went out, found a load of American animals, including

161
00:15:11,100 --> 00:15:17,380
 a weasel, and sent back all the precise measurements of all these animals. And one of them was the

162
00:15:17,380 --> 00:15:22,980
 distance, which I explained earlier. Yeah. And he was, he was so pissed off that this

163
00:15:22,980 --> 00:15:28,620
 guy had said this because he, the insinuation was if any European animals went over there,

164
00:15:28,620 --> 00:15:32,180
 they would sort of regress once they were there and just sort of shrivel and get smaller

165
00:15:32,180 --> 00:15:35,880
 as the generations went on. But the implication was also that American people would be like

166
00:15:35,880 --> 00:15:40,040
 that as well. So that American people would be much more small and insipid than Europeans.

167
00:15:40,040 --> 00:15:45,320
 And why? Because it was damp. Because it was damp. Because it was. I'm going to say as

168
00:15:45,320 --> 00:15:50,840
 well, as someone from the north, just because it's damp. Bufont, who was a brilliant guy,

169
00:15:50,840 --> 00:15:54,580
 I'm hoping to talk about him in a bit, but he was an amazing guy. But he claimed that

170
00:15:54,580 --> 00:15:58,680
 anywhere in North America, if you dug down by two feet, the ground would be frozen. He

171
00:15:58,680 --> 00:16:03,660
 was incorrect about this. He was hugely incorrect about it. But it basically, there was this

172
00:16:03,660 --> 00:16:08,940
 theory which they referred to as New World Degeneracy. Kind of the idea was lots of old

173
00:16:08,940 --> 00:16:15,140
 European countries, they're more aristocratically run. America was, it liked to think of itself

174
00:16:15,140 --> 00:16:19,780
 as being founded on more egalitarian lines or more democratic lines and not needing a

175
00:16:19,780 --> 00:16:26,140
 nobility class. And so they wanted to find scientific underpinning for that, that America

176
00:16:26,140 --> 00:16:31,760
 was a kind of- Did they want to kind of cast aspersions on it so that people weren't attracted

177
00:16:31,760 --> 00:16:36,120
 to going there? I think this guy was just a bit of a curious cookie, right? He sort of

178
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:39,880
 had lots of theories before. He had lots of theories about the age of the earth. He just

179
00:16:39,880 --> 00:16:43,560
 was building up these theories. And it's just so great that Jefferson was so pissed off.

180
00:16:43,560 --> 00:16:47,200
 And there was a lot going on at this time. And he was like, I need measurements of animals

181
00:16:47,200 --> 00:16:52,360
 and all these guys who are about to change America are suddenly out there measuring Weasel's

182
00:16:52,360 --> 00:16:58,020
 anus' devolvers. The report came back and he presented it to Buffon and he said, look

183
00:16:58,020 --> 00:17:04,700
 at it, our bears are 410 pounds. Yours are 153 here in Europe. We've got 12 pound otters.

184
00:17:04,700 --> 00:17:08,380
 Your otters are terrible compared to our otters. All this sort of stuff. And he was like, and

185
00:17:08,380 --> 00:17:12,100
 don't get me started on the moose. Our moose are massive. And he's like, Buffon was like,

186
00:17:12,100 --> 00:17:15,780
 you kind of massive moose over there, surely not. He was like, mate, it's huge. Our moose

187
00:17:15,780 --> 00:17:19,940
 are so big, your reindeers walk under them. That's how big they are. And he didn't believe

188
00:17:19,940 --> 00:17:24,480
 him. So then Jefferson writes back to the guys again and says, send me a fucking moose.

189
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:30,000
 And they have to go out and find a moose and send it. And they do. They did. Yeah. And

190
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:34,600
 it was rubbish when it turned up because it had been taken months to find it, dry it,

191
00:17:34,600 --> 00:17:37,840
 skin it, debone it, whatever you do with the moose, you know, you had to. I have a lot

192
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:45,920
 of questions about how they measured the animals. Did they anesthetize them? And if so, did

193
00:17:45,920 --> 00:17:51,500
 they have anaesthetic? I'm afraid they might have not always been alive. The animals by

194
00:17:51,500 --> 00:17:56,760
 the time they were, yeah, especially the weasels. I feel very naive. Yeah. I'm like, how did

195
00:17:56,760 --> 00:18:02,380
 they hold them nicely and safely while they measured from their anus to their vulva? And

196
00:18:02,380 --> 00:18:06,700
 a weasel as well, which will be quite, quite fidgety. That I have to say, you've just brought

197
00:18:06,700 --> 00:18:11,220
 up a great time travel destination point. Imagine going back in history, landing and

198
00:18:11,220 --> 00:18:16,760
 watch Madison measuring the anus to vulva, the weasel. The other thing is Madison was

199
00:18:16,760 --> 00:18:20,700
 famously very slight, wasn't he? Oh, yeah. He's really, really smallest president there

200
00:18:20,700 --> 00:18:26,560
 was. He was five. Are you about to speculate on the distance, but from the anus? Oh, wow.

201
00:18:26,560 --> 00:18:29,660
 Is that where you're going? I wasn't going to go there. All right. My mistake. He could

202
00:18:29,660 --> 00:18:34,760
 overpower a weasel. He could walk underneath a moose. Interesting. But it would have been

203
00:18:34,760 --> 00:18:39,400
 funnier to see him wrestling with a weasel than a blinker, for instance, who's a big

204
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:43,980
 man, I would say. That's true. James Madison was five foot four and he weighed just under

205
00:18:43,980 --> 00:18:48,620
 a hundred pounds. It's about the same as Mila Kunis when she was in black swan, if that

206
00:18:48,620 --> 00:18:55,500
 helps. It does help. Small. Small. Yeah. Was he maybe the shortest president? He was the

207
00:18:55,500 --> 00:18:58,840
 shortest, but quite a bit. It's about a few inches. Yeah. Although he sounds like a great

208
00:18:58,840 --> 00:19:03,380
 guy too. Oh, yeah. I mean, all these people sound like really interesting guys. Yeah. May

209
00:19:03,380 --> 00:19:10,720
 I tell you something about more about Jefferson's letters? Oh, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So in 1787,

210
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:16,200
 the same Thomas Jefferson wrote a letter to Peter Carr, his nephew, but he said, if you

211
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:21,360
 don't get married, do have affairs with women. Oh no. Oh my God. Sorry. I'm getting my facts

212
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:25,960
 mixed up. Hang on. No. Can I erase that on the tape? Who's doing the tape? The gossip

213
00:19:25,960 --> 00:19:33,080
 is about to turn to slander. Right. Benjamin Franklin, not Jefferson. Benjamin Franklin,

214
00:19:33,080 --> 00:19:38,420
 advised a young man to have sex with older women, not younger women. Okay. And he really

215
00:19:38,420 --> 00:19:47,260
 set out all of the reasons why. Okay. Better conversation. More. I hope someone's going

216
00:19:47,260 --> 00:19:57,380
 to worry for all of these. More even tempered. Yeah. Rather darkly, no risk of children accidentally.

217
00:19:57,380 --> 00:20:04,880
 Okay. More sexually experienced. You'll love this if there's any older women in the crowd.

218
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:11,320
 I am loving this one. He said, you might as well because if covering all above with a

219
00:20:11,320 --> 00:20:16,480
 basket and regarding only what is below the girdle, it's impossible of two women to know

220
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:24,040
 an old one from a young one. Wow. Covering all above with a basket. Yeah. And his final

221
00:20:24,040 --> 00:20:31,360
 reason was that eighthly and lastly, they're so grateful. Wow. Thanks, Ben Franklin. Well,

222
00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:39,200
 you can see why I married my 90 year old wife now. Wasn't just for the pillow table. Wow.

223
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:45,560
 That's quite something. Franklin. Yeah. Yeah. Wow. Who's got a basket that big? Like a laundry

224
00:20:45,560 --> 00:20:50,000
 basket. I imagined a laundry basket. Oh yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I could probably fit

225
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:57,000
 myself, my entire self in my laundry basket. Sorry. I'm boastful. I'd have to tuck, but

226
00:20:57,000 --> 00:21:08,400
 tuck myself up. Sorry, just for the take. Jesus Christ. We're all here, Andy. We can

227
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:14,480
 all hear what you're saying. I refuse to believe that. Can I talk about either Madison or

228
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:22,360
 Buffon? Please talk about anything else. Okay. Let's talk about just a couple more things

229
00:21:22,360 --> 00:21:26,760
 on Madison because we were talking about before. He was a very significant president who gets

230
00:21:26,760 --> 00:21:29,920
 kind of a bit overlooked because he was what fourth in the running orders. So, you know,

231
00:21:29,920 --> 00:21:33,280
 everyone knows about George Washington and John Adams and blah, blah, blah. Madison was

232
00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:38,120
 president during the War of 1812, which is when the British invaded and torched the White

233
00:21:38,120 --> 00:21:43,120
 House. Yeah. And he had to flee at the time. He was actually in residence at the time.

234
00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:48,000
 He was the last person alive who signed the Constitution, which is quite something for

235
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:54,600
 some years. And he died in 1836. He was 85 years old at the time. And it was late June,

236
00:21:54,600 --> 00:21:59,480
 right? Late June, he's dying. He's 85. And his doctor says, you know what we could do?

237
00:21:59,480 --> 00:22:04,720
 We could give you some crazy drugs that will keep you alive until the 4th of July, which

238
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:09,560
 is Independence Day. Oh yeah. Because at that point, three previous presidents had all died

239
00:22:09,560 --> 00:22:14,280
 on the 4th of July. And the doctor basically said, want to make it four? We can, you know...

240
00:22:14,280 --> 00:22:17,600
 Yeah, yeah. Did he not think, why don't you just keep giving me those crazy drugs for

241
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:22,120
 longer than that? Well, yes, that is a really good point. I think they were kind of very

242
00:22:22,120 --> 00:22:26,920
 last resort. Yeah, they were. Stimulus things. And he, to his great credit, said, you know

243
00:22:26,920 --> 00:22:31,680
 what, I'm okay. When I die, I die. And he died on the 28th of June. Yeah. But his doctor

244
00:22:31,680 --> 00:22:36,860
 was the same one who took care of Jefferson, who did die on the 4th of July. So maybe they

245
00:22:36,860 --> 00:22:39,560
 missed that. Well, I don't know. Yeah, they might have done it better as well. I tell you

246
00:22:39,560 --> 00:22:43,480
 the thing, because I think this relates to what you took about Jefferson that I accidentally

247
00:22:43,480 --> 00:22:49,380
 started earlier. Oh yeah. And this is about Thomas Jefferson now. In 1787, he was writing

248
00:22:49,380 --> 00:22:53,440
 to his nephew. And I just found it interesting what you're talking about, signing the Constitution

249
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:57,840
 and what Americans think of themselves, and that Jefferson was actually pretty much a

250
00:22:57,840 --> 00:23:07,260
 skeptic, really interrogated the Bible, and believed in constantly questioning what said

251
00:23:07,260 --> 00:23:12,540
 in the Bible, you know, and he said, "Shake off all the fears and servile prejudices under

252
00:23:12,540 --> 00:23:17,620
 which weak minds are servilely crouched." In other words, saying that his nephew shouldn't

253
00:23:17,620 --> 00:23:21,900
 be afraid to question the text of the Bible. And he even questioned the existence of God,

254
00:23:21,900 --> 00:23:26,700
 saying, "Question with boldness even the existence of a God, because if there be one, he must

255
00:23:26,700 --> 00:23:31,440
 approve of the homage of reason rather than that blindfolded fear." So that's quite

256
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:36,440
 cool. Yeah. And thirdly, get yourself a really big wicker basket, and that's what we're

257
00:23:36,440 --> 00:23:42,520
 going to do with that. Buffon did that as well, didn't he? He was, they're all enlightenment

258
00:23:42,520 --> 00:23:46,160
 people, weren't they? And they were questioning what was in the Bible and stuff like that.

259
00:23:46,160 --> 00:23:50,840
 Buffon was kind of the Aristotle of his day, in that he hoovered up a huge amount of information

260
00:23:50,840 --> 00:23:56,200
 and turned it into, I think it was 44 volumes, the work he produced. It was absolutely mega.

261
00:23:56,200 --> 00:24:01,220
 There's another experiment he did. He wanted to see how old the Earth was at the time,

262
00:24:01,220 --> 00:24:05,220
 quite controversial to say it would be more than several thousand years old. So he heated

263
00:24:05,220 --> 00:24:10,780
 up balls of iron until they were white hot, right? And then he saw how long they took

264
00:24:10,780 --> 00:24:15,340
 to cool down, and then he just scaled up to the size of the Earth and said, "Well, that

265
00:24:15,340 --> 00:24:20,460
 must be how long the Earth took to cool down after it was a ball of molten iron." It's

266
00:24:20,460 --> 00:24:28,720
 a good idea. He assessed 75,000 years, obviously flat wrong, but privately, privately he thought

267
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:32,160
 it was more like three million, which is also still several orders of magnitude wrong. But

268
00:24:32,160 --> 00:24:40,260
 he's getting there. It's getting closer. And he partly went with the lower number because

269
00:24:40,260 --> 00:24:43,480
 he thought it would be more acceptable to the church, and he had to preface it with

270
00:24:43,480 --> 00:24:47,160
 an introduction saying, "Obviously, this is just a crazy thought experiment I've done."

271
00:24:47,160 --> 00:24:51,900
 He was still doing the work. The important thing is that he was questioning these things

272
00:24:51,900 --> 00:24:53,660
 that have been passed down, all those things.

273
00:24:53,660 --> 00:24:59,660
 It sounds like Pliny saying Aristotle, but yeah, he's got an encyclopedia of plans.

274
00:24:59,660 --> 00:25:01,260
 Pliny's the one I meant. Sorry, Pliny's the one I meant.

275
00:25:01,260 --> 00:25:04,980
 Oh, Pliny is the one that you meant. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Just sort of like, I reckon if

276
00:25:04,980 --> 00:25:11,700
 I'd lived in that time, even with the kind of modern day intelligence that I have, please.

277
00:25:11,700 --> 00:25:18,320
 What's the end of that sentence? Well, I definitely would have been like, he's right.

278
00:25:18,320 --> 00:25:23,600
 Yeah. Are you saying, if you were teleported back

279
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:28,680
 now, having done this podcast for nine years, and we've talked about Pliny and how wrong

280
00:25:28,680 --> 00:25:34,160
 he was about everything, like how women have four teeth and all these mad claims he made,

281
00:25:34,160 --> 00:25:41,480
 you'd be like, "Cool, sounds legit. Okay. I think you could be Pliny. I would dethrone

282
00:25:41,480 --> 00:25:46,900
 Pliny if I were you. If you end up in this crazy situation, I would do it."

283
00:25:46,900 --> 00:25:51,100
 He also, like, it's really weird because he was very obsessed with how American animals

284
00:25:51,100 --> 00:25:55,100
 were very, not superior. Just wanted to make the point that they were not weak.

285
00:25:55,100 --> 00:25:58,260
 So this is Jefferson. Sorry, back to Jefferson, that there were

286
00:25:58,260 --> 00:26:03,060
 bigger animals. The author was bigger and so on. But he did also love European animals,

287
00:26:03,060 --> 00:26:07,660
 and he brought dogs back to Virginia, a shepherd dog. And interestingly, it's a kind of dog

288
00:26:07,660 --> 00:26:13,320
 that historians can't quite agree on of what it was. So he was in Paris. He went out miles

289
00:26:13,320 --> 00:26:18,280
 into a storm one night to try and find one, because he'd heard rumors of where one was.

290
00:26:18,280 --> 00:26:22,660
 And he eventually found a pregnant one, and he brought it back to Virginia. And he was

291
00:26:22,660 --> 00:26:26,380
 so excited, and he was breeding these dogs. And then something, and again, it's slightly

292
00:26:26,380 --> 00:26:30,800
 murky, what happened, just went wrong. And he got rid of the dogs, and he had all his

293
00:26:30,800 --> 00:26:36,280
 dogs executed, and he just turned into someone who hated dogs for the rest of his life.

294
00:26:36,280 --> 00:26:39,780
 Executed is a strong word. Well, it's the right word.

295
00:26:39,780 --> 00:26:44,580
 The vet doesn't come in and say, "I'm going to have to execute your dog." Sorry.

296
00:26:44,580 --> 00:26:49,980
 We've assembled the firing squad. I'm sorry I didn't fluff it up for you.

297
00:26:49,980 --> 00:26:54,620
 And then what happened is, he had all of them move to a farm where they had wonderful lives.

298
00:26:54,620 --> 00:26:58,620
 Of course we'll blindfold your goldfish, Mrs Prescott.

299
00:27:05,500 --> 00:27:10,480
 Okay, it is time for fact number three, and that is my fact. My fact this week is that

300
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:17,480
 during the Second World War, Steinway parachuted pianos into battlefields. So this was a morale

301
00:27:17,480 --> 00:27:23,560
 thing where they thought, "We need to make this a bit more cheery, this whole World War

302
00:27:23,560 --> 00:27:30,560
 II thing." And why not get a bunch of, because music is such a great thing to raise spirits

303
00:27:30,560 --> 00:27:34,760
 and so on. And at this point, Steinway was put under restrictions by the government because

304
00:27:34,760 --> 00:27:39,140
 they couldn't use lots of medals. And so during the war effort, they were making coffins,

305
00:27:39,140 --> 00:27:43,180
 unfortunately, but they were also making random bits and pieces. And then they hit upon the

306
00:27:43,180 --> 00:27:49,300
 idea of making a portable piano, a tall standing piano, that they could just parachute out

307
00:27:49,300 --> 00:27:55,420
 of planes into battlefields. And 3,000 were dropped off over the course of the war, landed

308
00:27:55,420 --> 00:27:59,780
 safely. And there's so many stories of these pianos being played by the troops as they

309
00:27:59,780 --> 00:28:04,260
 were gathering around and stuff. It's a lovely idea, but you know that some assholes banging

310
00:28:04,260 --> 00:28:10,640
 out Wonderwall at 3 a.m. It's always that guy.

311
00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:16,680
 Yeah, so they were known as victory verticals and they weren't just used for parachuting

312
00:28:16,680 --> 00:28:21,640
 into the battlefield. They were put into submarines as well, which is a really interesting thing

313
00:28:21,640 --> 00:28:26,000
 because in order to get them into a submarine, you need the submarine not to be shut first

314
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:28,160
 as in entirely encased, right?

315
00:28:28,160 --> 00:28:29,160
 Not build.

316
00:28:29,160 --> 00:28:33,000
 Yeah, it's like during the building process, you have to put it in. And so once they're

317
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:37,820
 in, they're stuck in there. And going forward just a bit, there is a ship which is called

318
00:28:37,820 --> 00:28:44,660
 the USS Thomas Edison, which is the only submarine rather, which has an actual Steinway,

319
00:28:44,660 --> 00:28:49,380
 like a proper grand piano style Steinway, and they can't take it out. It was in there

320
00:28:49,380 --> 00:28:50,380
 for 22 years.

321
00:28:50,380 --> 00:28:55,660
 Imagine being on a submarine with a guy who's brought his grade one book. I'm going to be

322
00:28:55,660 --> 00:29:01,540
 learning actually for the next nine months. These are victory verticals. They just sound

323
00:29:01,540 --> 00:29:06,840
 so cool. And they're so interesting. They were painted. Oh, DGI, Olive Drab, government

324
00:29:06,840 --> 00:29:11,200
 issue because they were painted dark green. And they could, they had no legs because that

325
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:15,160
 might not survive the parachute drop. And the history of Steinway during the war is

326
00:29:15,160 --> 00:29:19,800
 so mad because Steinway was a German American company. Founders were German, still had a

327
00:29:19,800 --> 00:29:25,140
 factory in Germany, had a factory in New York as well. And both sides demanded different

328
00:29:25,140 --> 00:29:32,140
 things of Steinway. So in Germany, they were suspected of being a Jewish company, and they

329
00:29:32,140 --> 00:29:36,260
 had to deny that and, you know, sort of prove that they weren't. And in America, they were

330
00:29:36,260 --> 00:29:39,300
 suspected of being Nazis because they were called Steinway. So they had this terrible

331
00:29:39,300 --> 00:29:43,140
 time and they had to hang American flags all over their buildings, kind of show that we

332
00:29:43,140 --> 00:29:47,620
 are, you know, we're patriotic. And this is the weird thing. Both separate halves of

333
00:29:47,620 --> 00:29:52,620
 the company made planes, wooden planes for the war effort for the side they were in.

334
00:29:52,620 --> 00:29:59,540
 Oh, my God. German Steinways were making decoy planes to be bombed. The American Steinways

335
00:29:59,540 --> 00:30:04,860
 were making gliders, which were real planes, but they were wood. They were very light and

336
00:30:04,860 --> 00:30:09,060
 feels like both sides could have gotten together and just said, you know what, let's just cross

337
00:30:09,060 --> 00:30:14,460
 this line out of the exactly just like completely disregard this. Yeah. And so they made these

338
00:30:14,460 --> 00:30:18,840
 incredibly powerful gliders because gliders were an incredibly amazing tool for getting

339
00:30:18,840 --> 00:30:23,980
 past enemy defenses and landing soldiers. Right. So the first one they built, they tested,

340
00:30:23,980 --> 00:30:27,420
 they loaded it with a ton of stuff and then it got towed behind another plane because

341
00:30:27,420 --> 00:30:31,060
 that's how you get a glider somewhere. It got towed three and a half thousand miles

342
00:30:31,060 --> 00:30:34,820
 from Montreal to Britain in one day. And this was just the test flight to see if the gliders

343
00:30:34,820 --> 00:30:40,220
 worked and it contained vaccines for Russia, military equipment for the free French parts

344
00:30:40,220 --> 00:30:45,700
 for some bomber planes and a bunch of bananas for the pilot's family in London. Very sweet.

345
00:30:45,700 --> 00:30:49,280
 Yeah. They made, they made over a thousand during the war. These gliders, the American

346
00:30:49,280 --> 00:30:53,360
 Steinways. Yeah. That's amazing. Very weird. These pianos, obviously, because it's a war,

347
00:30:53,360 --> 00:30:57,680
 you don't have all of the stuff that you can normally make pianos out of, right? So they

348
00:30:57,680 --> 00:31:02,120
 use a lot less metal that you get in a normal piano. Instead of the copper strings, they

349
00:31:02,120 --> 00:31:06,720
 use soft iron strings. Instead of ivory keys that they couldn't get, they use celluloid.

350
00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:13,200
 And the thing is with celluloid is if you bang it, it explodes, which must have been, you

351
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:18,300
 know, if you're really doing a proper rack-running off sort of slam on your keys, it takes a

352
00:31:18,300 --> 00:31:23,780
 whole new meaning to a banger on the piano. Do you know the White House has a Steinway?

353
00:31:23,780 --> 00:31:30,020
 Did they? Yeah. And it is tiny. It's about, it's like this big. What? It's a really tiny

354
00:31:30,020 --> 00:31:36,740
 Steinway. It's a, wait, we should say for the people at home, you were doing like a sort

355
00:31:36,740 --> 00:31:41,660
 of six inch high. Yeah. I, do you know what I am? Then what it looked like a massive idiot.

356
00:31:41,660 --> 00:31:45,640
 You know, when you have a scale, and I just can't remember how to pronounce the scale,

357
00:31:45,640 --> 00:31:50,440
 but it's one piano scale. No, not the piano scale, the size scale. So it's one, one,

358
00:31:50,440 --> 00:31:55,120
 two, to seven. Yeah. So it's one to seven. So it's a seven to size. Yeah. Exactly. That's

359
00:31:55,120 --> 00:32:01,240
 a good way of saying it. So it's a seven to the size of a proper Steinway. And you nearly

360
00:32:01,240 --> 00:32:05,600
 look like an idiot there, Dan, but you sort of sweat. That's bigger than that then. Um,

361
00:32:05,600 --> 00:32:09,960
 because the Steinway is massive. So couple of feet, couple of feet each way. Yeah. Maybe.

362
00:32:09,960 --> 00:32:13,300
 Yeah. Again, I was doing the hand size, knowing that the audience at home couldn't see what

363
00:32:13,300 --> 00:32:17,740
 I was doing. So who was it? Who was it for? Well, it's for the White House. And it's a

364
00:32:17,740 --> 00:32:22,420
 replica of a, of a Steinway that they did actually have and which has now been moved

365
00:32:22,420 --> 00:32:29,500
 into a museum. So this guy who's an artist who created it, spent 16 years basically conceiving,

366
00:32:29,500 --> 00:32:34,620
 creating, building it and making sure that it functions exactly like a Steinway of regular

367
00:32:34,620 --> 00:32:39,340
 size. And even to the point, this is how sort of obsessed he was about doing it, that when

368
00:32:39,340 --> 00:32:43,440
 he was making the actual pieces themselves, because there's so many pieces, there's something

369
00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:49,480
 like 12,000 pieces that go into a Steinway. He even made tiny versions of the machines

370
00:32:49,480 --> 00:32:55,280
 that make the bigger pieces to then make the tiny pieces from in order to produce the Steinway.

371
00:32:55,280 --> 00:33:01,080
 You're looking very skeptical here. Rachel, at some point, you have to ask why? Yeah.

372
00:33:01,080 --> 00:33:06,720
 Why not just make a Steinway? It's easier to play. Yeah. You'd have to play this one

373
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:10,940
 with little chopstick fingers, you know, with little like sticks. Oh, that'd be great though.

374
00:33:10,940 --> 00:33:15,540
 When you played the chopsticks. Yeah. Yeah. No, that's, that exists. That is fascinating.

375
00:33:15,540 --> 00:33:20,040
 You know, think, you know that thing of getting your piano dropped on your head? In cartoons.

376
00:33:20,040 --> 00:33:23,620
 In cartoons. Yeah. There is a place in the world where that happens for real every year.

377
00:33:23,620 --> 00:33:29,140
 What? What do you mean? So MIT, the American University, they have a tradition every year,

378
00:33:29,140 --> 00:33:33,700
 the piano drop, where they drop a piano off the roof. But not onto someone's head. Yes,

379
00:33:33,700 --> 00:33:39,480
 onto someone's head. It's whoever comes last in the class each year. You'd say executed,

380
00:33:39,480 --> 00:33:44,560
 I guess, by, no, they don't. They're really, really careful about, obviously. But since

381
00:33:44,560 --> 00:33:48,120
 1972, they had this broken piano. They wanted to get rid of it somehow. It's just a bunch

382
00:33:48,120 --> 00:33:51,540
 of students at this point. And they wanted to push it out of their window because that

383
00:33:51,540 --> 00:33:55,120
 would be crazy and fun for their students. And then they read the rules and they found

384
00:33:55,120 --> 00:33:59,160
 out, oh, you can't, you can't throw things out of your window. But then, because they're

385
00:33:59,160 --> 00:34:03,080
 students, they read the rules really closely, they found out there's no rule against pushing

386
00:34:03,080 --> 00:34:07,180
 it off the roof. Just out of your window, that's not allowed. But off the roof, not

387
00:34:07,180 --> 00:34:12,820
 in the rules. So they did it. And half a century on now, they are still doing it. And they're

388
00:34:12,820 --> 00:34:16,540
 very tight on security and they, you know, everyone closes their windows and they in

389
00:34:16,540 --> 00:34:20,980
 fact do even more than that in terms of security. Yeah. And sometimes they fill it with sweets

390
00:34:20,980 --> 00:34:26,220
 or confetti. Yeah. They stopped during COVID, didn't they? And then they started again last

391
00:34:26,220 --> 00:34:28,900
 year. I guess the piano was full of COVID.

392
00:34:28,900 --> 00:34:36,280
 They filled it with sweets like a sort of pinionioata. There we go. Pianionianata. It

393
00:34:36,280 --> 00:34:38,920
 almost works. It almost works.

394
00:34:38,920 --> 00:34:42,360
 We should say it's always a broken piano. It's never them just trashing a functioning piano.

395
00:34:42,360 --> 00:34:45,400
 It's always a broken piano that can't be mended. Okay. Yeah, yeah.

396
00:34:45,400 --> 00:34:49,400
 This is kind of a common thing in America, isn't it? Or relatively common. Not as common

397
00:34:49,400 --> 00:34:50,400
 as McDonald's.

398
00:34:50,400 --> 00:34:53,080
 What, chugging pianos off a roof?

399
00:34:53,080 --> 00:34:57,040
 Yeah, dropping pianos. You kind of, once you start googling it, you're like, well, this

400
00:34:57,040 --> 00:35:01,660
 happens way more often than I thought. So the first one I think that I found anyway

401
00:35:01,660 --> 00:35:06,580
 was in 1968. And what happened was there were two musicians and they were driving a van

402
00:35:06,580 --> 00:35:11,860
 and there was a piano in the back of it and the piano actually accidentally fell out and

403
00:35:11,860 --> 00:35:15,860
 they thought it kind of made quite a nice sound. And they thought, well, what if we did

404
00:35:15,860 --> 00:35:20,860
 that but we dropped it from a helicopter? It'll make an even better sound. And so as

405
00:35:20,860 --> 00:35:26,820
 a benefit for a radio station that they decided to drop this piano from a helicopter. And yeah,

406
00:35:26,820 --> 00:35:31,880
 they did it. And they got 3,000 people there. They all paid to watch. At one stage, a dog

407
00:35:31,880 --> 00:35:38,640
 ran directly underneath the piano and sort of yapped around and the guy on the microphone

408
00:35:38,640 --> 00:35:43,760
 said asked everyone to whistle. And so everyone in the area whistled and then the dog sort

409
00:35:43,760 --> 00:35:45,800
 of went, oh, what's that? And ran off again.

410
00:35:45,800 --> 00:35:46,800
 Yeah, okay.

411
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:50,760
 Don't know how that works. But that's what happened. And they dropped the piano and it

412
00:35:50,760 --> 00:35:54,560
 made a big old noise but not nearly as nice a noise as they wanted. Turned out that it

413
00:35:54,560 --> 00:35:56,540
 didn't sound that good, but they made a lot of money anyway.

414
00:35:56,540 --> 00:36:05,980
 That sounds like something men would do, doesn't it? I don't want a stereotype. So they dropped

415
00:36:05,980 --> 00:36:11,620
 it a tiny amount and it made a magical sound. And then instead of going, that was nice, let's

416
00:36:11,620 --> 00:36:15,380
 do that again or do something really creative, they were like, let's drop it from a fucking

417
00:36:15,380 --> 00:36:20,820
 helicopter so that it does a massive smash. And of course that doesn't make as good a

418
00:36:20,820 --> 00:36:21,820
 sound.

419
00:36:21,820 --> 00:36:32,080
 I was just thinking, I wonder if we could do that.

420
00:36:32,080 --> 00:36:36,560
 We do need to move on to our final fact. It is time for our final fact of the show and

421
00:36:36,560 --> 00:36:38,080
 that is Andy.

422
00:36:38,080 --> 00:36:44,160
 My fact is that when filming E.T., Steven Spielberg kept E.T.'s puppeteers on the clock at lunch

423
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:50,440
 time so that six-year-old Drew Barrymore could eat with him so she kept believing he was real.

424
00:36:50,440 --> 00:36:56,260
 It's such a nice fact. She asked for a scarf for him to keep him warm because he's got

425
00:36:56,260 --> 00:37:01,060
 this very thin neck as an E.E.T. And actually they did adjust it. They adjusted the whole

426
00:37:01,060 --> 00:37:06,420
 filming for the children. They shot the film in chronological order, in order of the script,

427
00:37:06,420 --> 00:37:10,820
 which never happens because you're saving money here and you shoot these two scenes here,

428
00:37:10,820 --> 00:37:15,020
 but it meant the children really believed it more. They were going back into the same

429
00:37:15,020 --> 00:37:18,740
 world day after day. So it is kind of magical what they did.

430
00:37:18,740 --> 00:37:22,280
 So I watched a bunch of interviews this morning. Drew Barrymore has her own chat show and there

431
00:37:22,280 --> 00:37:27,040
 was the 40th anniversary of E.T. not too long ago and so all the cast members came back

432
00:37:27,040 --> 00:37:31,580
 on to chat about it. And so she kept saying, you know, I knew it was definitely a fake

433
00:37:31,580 --> 00:37:37,520
 thing and they were all going, absolutely. So what the thing was is that she was, during

434
00:37:37,520 --> 00:37:41,160
 the breaks, during lunch, they'd sort of go, where's Drew? And Drew would just be sitting

435
00:37:41,160 --> 00:37:46,280
 there just going, so what do you think about, and she was just chatting to this static model

436
00:37:46,280 --> 00:37:51,420
 that was sitting there. And so the mother, who I believe her real name's Dee Dee, she

437
00:37:51,420 --> 00:37:56,540
 went over to Steven Spielberg and said, I think she really believes that he's real.

438
00:37:56,540 --> 00:38:00,460
 We should possibly do something about that. So Steven then hired two people who were part

439
00:38:00,460 --> 00:38:05,140
 of the animatronic side. That was their job to basically sit there and just have the eyes

440
00:38:05,140 --> 00:38:10,420
 roll whenever she said an anecdote and stuff like that. And she keeps denying it, but every

441
00:38:10,420 --> 00:38:15,140
 single cast member says, no, you flat out believed that E.T. was real when you were five,

442
00:38:15,140 --> 00:38:19,800
 six, however she was. And he was amazing. I've got it. So my sons and I have just started

443
00:38:19,800 --> 00:38:23,280
 watching it again because they've just discovered it and you can buy these toys at the moment,

444
00:38:23,280 --> 00:38:29,520
 which is so just a reminder of what E.T. looks like for everyone. E.T. it is. That's James

445
00:38:29,520 --> 00:38:36,400
 Jesus. What? Have you even seen E.T.? Have you seen the movie? Maybe. Well, does that

446
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:43,120
 know what happens? Deliberately winding people up. Deliberately winding down up. I have seen

447
00:38:43,120 --> 00:38:46,900
 E.T. I've watched it when it first came out when I was about three or four years old, I

448
00:38:46,900 --> 00:38:51,860
 think. Nice. Right. So I don't remember anything about it. I believed it was all real. Yeah.

449
00:38:51,860 --> 00:38:56,180
 He looked so real and that's the thing. The animatronic side of things were extraordinary.

450
00:38:56,180 --> 00:39:02,900
 So if E.T. was static, just standing and doing the scene, there was like 120 different things

451
00:39:02,900 --> 00:39:07,340
 that could happen to E.T. in that point. If he was using his hands, there was a woman

452
00:39:07,340 --> 00:39:13,240
 who was a mime who would be laying underneath E.T. who had E.T. glove hands on and she would

453
00:39:13,240 --> 00:39:17,840
 be doing all the movements while someone else was doing the voices and so on. Then you had

454
00:39:17,840 --> 00:39:25,040
 three actors. One was a child who didn't have any legs. He was part of the main cast. He

455
00:39:25,040 --> 00:39:30,760
 became their best friends. When E.T. is walking through the kitchen, he was the one who, walking

456
00:39:30,760 --> 00:39:35,960
 on his hands inside the E.T. suit, was slamming into the fridge and falling over and stuff.

457
00:39:35,960 --> 00:39:38,100
 Really? Yeah. So there were so many different elements

458
00:39:38,100 --> 00:39:43,540
 that went into this one character. Do you know that the company that could have made E.T.

459
00:39:43,540 --> 00:39:49,340
 was Columbia, right? And they said no to it. Okay. Like idiots. Why? Because it was the

460
00:39:49,340 --> 00:39:54,180
 biggest film of all time. Did they say no? Oh, sorry, sorry. They ran surveys on it and

461
00:39:54,180 --> 00:39:59,140
 the marketing department said, "It's got limited commercial appeal." I know. And so it went

462
00:39:59,140 --> 00:40:02,460
 to Universal, right? And then Columbia had originally worked on it. So they got I think

463
00:40:02,460 --> 00:40:07,600
 5% of the net profits. One executive from Columbia said that year, the year it came out, they

464
00:40:07,600 --> 00:40:13,040
 made more money on E.T. where they got 5% of the net profits than on any of their own

465
00:40:13,040 --> 00:40:19,960
 actual films. It was so huge. It really was. It was absolutely, it was monstrous, you know.

466
00:40:19,960 --> 00:40:24,360
 Which is bad because Spielberg's massive at this point. He's just made Indiana Jones.

467
00:40:24,360 --> 00:40:27,400
 He's made Indiana Jones. He's made Close Encounters of a Third Kind.

468
00:40:27,400 --> 00:40:30,760
 Yes, he's made a load of bits. He's made, yeah, Jaws. Like the guy is, the guy is.

469
00:40:30,760 --> 00:40:35,420
 This was meant to be his small film in between big films. And then it turns into the biggest

470
00:40:35,420 --> 00:40:39,180
 film he's ever made. Speaking of, Harrison Ford was in E.T.

471
00:40:39,180 --> 00:40:47,620
 Was he? Yeah, he got cut. But they filmed it. He was, he was Elliot's principal, school

472
00:40:47,620 --> 00:40:51,780
 principal. And it ended up on the cutting room floor.

473
00:40:51,780 --> 00:40:56,300
 That's ballsy directing as well. That's why Spielberg's a genius. Oh, thank you, Harrison.

474
00:40:56,300 --> 00:41:00,600
 It hasn't really worked. Why did he cut him? I guess he was too famous for what?

475
00:41:00,600 --> 00:41:03,400
 For time, I suppose. And when you think about the story, like it must have been a bit of

476
00:41:03,400 --> 00:41:06,220
 an offshoot of the story. What would be mega distracting to see Indiana

477
00:41:06,220 --> 00:41:09,880
 Jones in the middle of the E.T. film? Yeah, it's post Indiana Jones, right?

478
00:41:09,880 --> 00:41:13,180
 Yeah, yeah. It was, it was the next film. So it would be odd, yeah.

479
00:41:13,180 --> 00:41:14,180
 It would be, it would be really weird. Yeah, yeah.

480
00:41:14,180 --> 00:41:18,200
 Because Henry Thomas, who's the kid who plays Elliot, which if, just for anyone here and

481
00:41:18,200 --> 00:41:22,440
 anyone listening, if you haven't seen it, there is a clip online of him auditioning for

482
00:41:22,440 --> 00:41:26,020
 the role of Elliot. It's one of the most heartwarming things ever, right?

483
00:41:26,020 --> 00:41:29,460
 So awful and sad and beautiful. Yeah, it's when the, it's when the military

484
00:41:29,460 --> 00:41:34,120
 are coming to try and take E.T. away from him. So you've just got a shot of him crying

485
00:41:34,120 --> 00:41:37,580
 going, but I don't want to give him up. He's mine. It's really touching, really, really

486
00:41:37,580 --> 00:41:41,420
 touching. And it's the best bit at the end where you just hear Spielberg off screen go,

487
00:41:41,420 --> 00:41:44,260
 you got the job, kid. It's just, it's wonderful in that moment.

488
00:41:44,260 --> 00:41:48,100
 That's the thing that got it. But he arrived for his audition with a bullwhip because he

489
00:41:48,100 --> 00:41:51,460
 loved Indiana Jones so much. So he came as Indiana Jones.

490
00:41:51,460 --> 00:41:54,880
 And he didn't, he didn't ever try to attack E.T. with it though.

491
00:41:54,880 --> 00:42:00,040
 Yeah. Yeah, no, I saw, I was reading a biography of Spielberg and I got, there's an interpretation

492
00:42:00,040 --> 00:42:03,640
 of E.T., which I might just share with you all if that's all right. There's a scientist

493
00:42:03,640 --> 00:42:07,560
 who becomes friends with E.T., if you remember that. And, and, sorry, a friend of Elliot's

494
00:42:07,560 --> 00:42:11,600
 and helps E.T. to get home. And all the way through the film, he has a bunch of keys hanging

495
00:42:11,600 --> 00:42:14,600
 from his belt, right? That's a sort of key detail of him.

496
00:42:14,600 --> 00:42:18,000
 And also Elliot's parents are divorced and it's a film about loneliness and being a child

497
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:22,220
 and, you know, being alone and finding a friend. And it's really, it's really touching. And

498
00:42:22,220 --> 00:42:26,260
 Spielberg himself was from his, his parents got divorced. So it was kind of about himself

499
00:42:26,260 --> 00:42:30,580
 as a child, very moving stuff. This is the interpretation from a critic called Andrew

500
00:42:30,580 --> 00:42:37,260
 Saris about the scientist who befriends Elliot. Spielberg in the final sequence subtly implies

501
00:42:37,260 --> 00:42:42,420
 a romantic pairing of keys. That's the scientist with Elliot's mother. And he puts them in

502
00:42:42,420 --> 00:42:45,660
 shots together, but he doesn't spell it out. He doesn't have any dialogue. It just shows

503
00:42:45,660 --> 00:42:48,200
 them together and lets you draw your own implications.

504
00:42:48,200 --> 00:42:53,120
 Saris then writes, "Only children and Freudians can make the crucial connections between the

505
00:42:53,120 --> 00:42:59,560
 telltale keys fondled near the crotch of the potential father figure and the displaced

506
00:42:59,560 --> 00:43:06,600
 phallus represented by E.T. himself." Actually, looking at a model of E.T. here, I can't

507
00:43:06,600 --> 00:43:08,720
 see that, I think. Blimey, James.

508
00:43:08,720 --> 00:43:18,820
 I think you need to see a doctor, buddy. Yeah, isn't that the most insane thing you've ever

509
00:43:18,820 --> 00:43:19,820
 heard?

510
00:43:19,820 --> 00:43:20,820
 Yeah.

511
00:43:20,820 --> 00:43:21,820
 Yeah.

512
00:43:21,820 --> 00:43:27,420
 I need to think about this. Are they suggesting the keys are like unlocking something?

513
00:43:27,420 --> 00:43:28,860
 I think that might be the, yeah.

514
00:43:28,860 --> 00:43:29,860
 Is that what it is?

515
00:43:29,860 --> 00:43:30,860
 Okay.

516
00:43:30,860 --> 00:43:34,300
 Well, I think the keys are the penis, but also E.T. is the penis.

517
00:43:34,300 --> 00:43:35,300
 It's the penis.

518
00:43:35,300 --> 00:43:38,420
 But that's what I mean. If the keys can't be the penis, can they? If E.T. is the penis?

519
00:43:38,420 --> 00:43:41,260
 Well, I think for Freudians, a lot of it is the penis.

520
00:43:41,260 --> 00:43:46,080
 Do you see what I mean? If I was back in time, I'm immediately bored into this Freudian

521
00:43:46,080 --> 00:43:47,080
 thing.

522
00:43:47,080 --> 00:43:49,760
 I think you're crowded with the Agora in ancient Greece. I say, "Sorry, what's the E.T. thing

523
00:43:49,760 --> 00:43:51,260
 again?"

524
00:43:51,260 --> 00:43:58,880
 Drew Barrymore. I'm a massive fan of Drew Barrymore's, and she comes from a dynasty

525
00:43:58,880 --> 00:44:03,200
 of actors and producers and so on. She even Spielberg is her godfather. It's that kind

526
00:44:03,200 --> 00:44:04,360
 of thing, right?

527
00:44:04,360 --> 00:44:09,920
 And there's a story about her grandfather who was called John Barrymore. And when he

528
00:44:09,920 --> 00:44:16,920
 died, he used to play poker with a lot of other actors. Earl Flynn, who was the Aussie

529
00:44:16,920 --> 00:44:22,920
 turned American actor, a swashbuckling guy. W.C. Fields seemed to be one of the greatest

530
00:44:22,920 --> 00:44:27,400
 silent comedians of all time. And there was another person who was seen as an anarchist

531
00:44:27,400 --> 00:44:34,080
 that was their group, the four of them. Earl Flynn went to the morgue, stole John Barrymore,

532
00:44:34,080 --> 00:44:37,600
 brought him to the house, and they all had one last game of poker together.

533
00:44:37,600 --> 00:44:38,600
 No.

534
00:44:38,600 --> 00:44:41,720
 Yeah, David Niven writes about this in his book, and Drew Barrymore was asked about

535
00:44:41,720 --> 00:44:45,560
 it, and she confirmed that within the family that this absolutely is true. So they brought

536
00:44:45,560 --> 00:44:49,640
 him there, sat him at the table at Dead John Barrymore. They played their game of poker,

537
00:44:49,640 --> 00:44:53,880
 and then they returned him to the morgue when they were done. And Drew says she's even heard

538
00:44:53,880 --> 00:44:59,440
 rumours that the movie Weekend of Bernies is based on the kidnapping of the dead body

539
00:44:59,440 --> 00:45:00,440
 of John Barrymore.

540
00:45:00,440 --> 00:45:01,440
 Wow.

541
00:45:01,440 --> 00:45:02,440
 Yeah, pretty cool, eh?

542
00:45:02,440 --> 00:45:03,440
 Good fact.

543
00:45:03,440 --> 00:45:10,440
 I'd say if I die, I would love to be on one final episode of No Such Thing as a Fish.

544
00:45:10,440 --> 00:45:13,440
 You'll be there ongoing. We'll just have you permanently.

545
00:45:13,440 --> 00:45:14,440
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

546
00:45:14,440 --> 00:45:15,440
 Just sat there.

547
00:45:15,440 --> 00:45:17,440
 Yeah, the listeners won't notice the difference.

548
00:45:17,440 --> 00:45:19,440
 No, no, exactly.

549
00:45:19,440 --> 00:45:26,080
 The Voice of E.T., I find that interesting. This was a woman called Pat Welsh. She'd been

550
00:45:26,080 --> 00:45:33,420
 on a safari, and her photos had gotten mixed up with someone. And eventually, 20 years later,

551
00:45:33,420 --> 00:45:37,240
 she got the film back, and she went to get it developed. And when she was getting it

552
00:45:37,240 --> 00:45:41,680
 developed, she started speaking to the guy. And one of the people who was there was Ben

553
00:45:41,680 --> 00:45:47,200
 Burt, who was the sound engineer. And he heard her voice and went, "You would be perfect

554
00:45:47,200 --> 00:45:49,200
 for my alien."

555
00:45:49,200 --> 00:45:53,000
 And she'd done a little bit of stuff before. She'd been like a soap opera actress on the

556
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:56,780
 radio and stuff, but she hadn't really done very much. But she just had the perfect...

557
00:45:56,780 --> 00:46:03,500
 She'd smoked a lot of shit. That kind of... Yeah, exactly. But he took that, but he also

558
00:46:03,500 --> 00:46:09,680
 added an extra load of stuff. So he took her voice, but added some raccoons, some sea otters,

559
00:46:09,680 --> 00:46:16,860
 some horses, and a burp from his old cinema professor from USC. Oh, and his wife breathing

560
00:46:16,860 --> 00:46:21,360
 when she had a cold. So he took all these things and mixed them together with her voice

561
00:46:21,360 --> 00:46:22,360
 to make the E.T. Voice.

562
00:46:22,360 --> 00:46:28,460
 So cool. There's a great story that I heard recently. I was really lucky. I met a hero

563
00:46:28,460 --> 00:46:33,740
 recently, Dan Aykroyd, and he was telling me that when he was doing Temple of Doom,

564
00:46:33,740 --> 00:46:36,420
 because Dan Aykroyd is in Temple of Doom.

565
00:46:36,420 --> 00:46:37,420
 What?

566
00:46:37,420 --> 00:46:38,420
 Yeah, in Indiana Jones' Temple of Doom.

567
00:46:38,420 --> 00:46:39,920
 He plays the ball, doesn't he? The big ball.

568
00:46:39,920 --> 00:46:44,300
 That's Raiders, but yeah, it's no worries.

569
00:46:44,300 --> 00:46:50,980
 So it's an uncredited role in the movie, but you'll all remember the scene, possibly, at

570
00:46:50,980 --> 00:46:55,480
 the very beginning of Temple of Doom. There's the big fight with Lao Chi inside the Chinese

571
00:46:55,480 --> 00:46:56,480
 restaurant.

572
00:46:56,480 --> 00:46:57,480
 The nightclub, yeah.

573
00:46:57,480 --> 00:47:01,560
 And in order to get away, they go into a small plane, and he closes the door and he says,

574
00:47:01,560 --> 00:47:04,800
 "Nice try, Lao Chi," and he closes the door and it says Lao Chi's name on it, so you

575
00:47:04,800 --> 00:47:09,280
 know he's in trouble. Someone is talking to him to get him into the plane as they're

576
00:47:09,280 --> 00:47:14,040
 walking down the runway. That is Dan Aykroyd. So when you watch that again, it's Dan Aykroyd.

577
00:47:14,040 --> 00:47:18,040
 So he was on set with them, and he needed to get back to the set of Ghostbusters, which

578
00:47:18,040 --> 00:47:21,780
 they were filming at the time. So he said, "Steven, I'm going to head off." He needed

579
00:47:21,780 --> 00:47:26,340
 to get there quick. He saw a bicycle just hanging around, gets the bicycle, it's got

580
00:47:26,340 --> 00:47:27,340
 a basket and the fries.

581
00:47:27,340 --> 00:47:28,340
 It goes up.

582
00:47:28,340 --> 00:47:31,780
 And he flew in the sky. No, Andy!

583
00:47:31,780 --> 00:47:38,340
 No, but it later transpired that the bike that he'd taken was Elliot's bike.

584
00:47:38,340 --> 00:47:43,060
 I don't want to get all Freudian, and I don't really know much about this movie, but is

585
00:47:43,060 --> 00:47:49,320
 he gets into a big wicker basket, does he?

586
00:47:49,320 --> 00:47:53,000
 The thing is with extraterrestrials, as long as the basket is big enough, you can't tell

587
00:47:53,000 --> 00:48:01,120
 the difference.

588
00:48:01,120 --> 00:48:04,560
 That is it. That is all of our facts. Thank you so much for listening. If you would like

589

 At Rachael Paris.

596
00:48:17,440 --> 00:48:24,260
 And I know it's not called Twitter, but I'm not going to say the new fucking stupid name.
