 [ I don't know what to say, I don't know what to say. ]

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:08.300
 [ I don't know what to say, I don't know what to say. ]

00:00:08.300 --> 00:00:10.500
 [ I don't know what to say, I don't know what to say. ]

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:14.700
 Hello, and welcome to another episode of "No Such Thing As A Fish",

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:18.500
 a weekly podcast coming to you from the QI offices in Covent Garden.

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:22.200
 My name is Dan Shriver. I'm sitting here with Andy Murray, James Harkin,

00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:25.100
 and our friend Helen Arney of "Festival of the Spoken Nerd".

00:00:25.100 --> 00:00:28.700
 And once again, we've gathered around the microphones with our four favorite facts

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:32.700
 from the last seven days, and in no particular order, here we go.

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:34.700
 Starting with you, Helen.

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:38.700
 My fact is, tomorrow will be the longest day of your life.

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:41.700
 What do you know about my life?

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:43.700
 That means the tour is going to be so terrible.

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:48.200
 It's because I won't be with you, and that's why it's going to be so long.

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:52.200
 The days on Earth are getting longer all the time.

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:54.200
 On average, or this is an on average thing.

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:57.700
 So potentially tomorrow could be your longest ever day.

00:00:57.700 --> 00:00:59.700
 But then the day after that could be even longer.

00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:04.700
 Oh, wow. We're talking like tiny, tiny amounts, but the Earth is gradually being...

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:06.700
 So it's not like 20 minutes.

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:09.700
 Yeah, you don't suddenly wake up tomorrow, and you're like, "Wow, we've got an extra spare 20 minutes."

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:12.700
 It's like you've got a microsecond. You've got a microsecond spare.

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:15.700
 Oh, so what will I do with it?

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:17.700
 Take the dog for a walk.

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:21.700
 Thinking about what you will do with it, you will waste it.

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:27.200
 In the next 800 years, if we didn't adjust our clocks to account for this,

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:33.700
 we would be an hour out, so midday wouldn't be when the sun is at its highest point.

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:38.200
 It would be 1pm, so in 800 years' time, we'll be an hour out.

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:44.200
 Unless we adjust our clocks, and we add these things called leap seconds, all kinds of stuff.

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:47.200
 Do you know that the word noon used to mean 3pm?

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:50.200
 So you would go 12pm, 1, 2, noon, 4?

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:51.200
 Yeah, because it...

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:56.200
 Noon was the ninth hour of the day, and you can work back however many hours that was.

00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:58.200
 It was 6am, wasn't it?

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:01.200
 It was the first hour of the day. Was it Roman times?

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:05.200
 Actually, in medieval times, and I think it was for people who were praying,

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:09.200
 they would have to pray on the ninth hour, and so they would do the noon time prayers.

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:11.200
 And it would be at 3pm.

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:15.200
 So in the year 5,000 approximately midday will be...

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:17.200
 We'll be back there again.

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:19.200
 We'll be back in noon. This is perfect.

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:21.200
 What were you saying about leap seconds?

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:24.200
 Well, this is the weird bit about all of this slowing down.

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:27.200
 Because the earth is slowing down, there's nothing you can do about it.

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:32.200
 It's things like tidal forces, kind of slowing down the earth by moving in and out,

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:35.200
 changing the angular momentum if you want to get physicsy about it.

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:39.200
 But things like earthquakes, they can speed up the movement of the earth.

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:40.200
 Oh, really?

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:41.200
 So this is really an on-average thing.

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:46.200
 So over the last few decades, we've noticed that the earth has slowed down,

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:49.200
 but sometimes it's speeding up, and sometimes it's slowing down.

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:52.200
 So on average, it's slowing down.

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:55.200
 But they can't predict it exactly.

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:58.200
 So you can never say, right, next year we need to add a leap second.

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:00.200
 We'll get back to normal.

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:03.200
 Because some years, you're going a bit slower, some years getting faster.

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:08.200
 So these organisations decide they're kind of like the real time lords.

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:10.200
 They decide when we're going to add a leap second.

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:14.200
 There's a guy at the National Physical Laboratory, which is down in South London.

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:18.200
 And he's kind of in charge a little bit of this kind of measurement of the time.

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:21.200
 He's known as the time lord, like you were saying.

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:22.200
 They call him the time lord.

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:24.200
 His real name is Peter Wibbley.

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:31.200
 But that's really interesting because Dr. Who calls his sonic screwdriver the Wibbley Wibbley.

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:32.200
 So he's got a...

00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:33.200
 You see, yeah, yeah.

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:35.200
 It's the Wibbley Wibbley time you, why me?

00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:37.200
 Anyway, Peter Wibbley, we're going to call him the time lord.

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:41.200
 He said there are consequences with tinkering with time.

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:43.200
 Are the consequences dialects?

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:46.200
 Robo men?

00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:47.200
 No.

00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:48.200
 Robo men?

00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:49.200
 I don't want to.

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:50.200
 Cyber men.

00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:51.200
 Yeah, sure.

00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:57.200
 But it is a trade off, though, because computer time is clocking along in its own happy way,

00:03:57.200 --> 00:04:03.200
 being exactly 60 seconds, exactly 60 minutes, exactly 24 hours.

00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:06.200
 But the earth is doing something a little bit differently.

00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:08.200
 The earth is doing 20 hours.

00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:09.200
 Doing it's fine.

00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:10.200
 One second.

00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:11.200
 Every couple of years.

00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:15.200
 And the thing is, if we do change it, then we need to tell the computers as well.

00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:20.200
 That's where it goes, hurry wrong, because they can only tell you six months in advance they're going to add a leap second.

00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:23.200
 All of the stock exchanges are now computerized.

00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:29.200
 And one second, adding one second to one computer and not adding it to another.

00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:30.200
 Yeah.

00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:35.200
 And that means that all of the financial transactions happening in micro seconds can be exploited.

00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:37.200
 Suddenly, the stock exchanges can go.

00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:38.200
 Wow.

00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:44.200
 The thing, Andy, about the number of the average time that people hold onto a share is like 0.01 seconds or something.

00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:49.200
 Because they all happen so quickly and so micro transactions happening all the time.

00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:53.200
 Like, you or I might own 10 shares in Tesco's or whatever.

00:04:53.200 --> 00:04:54.200
 I certainly have.

00:04:54.200 --> 00:04:59.200
 I was very worried when the quarterly figures came out.

00:04:59.200 --> 00:05:04.200
 But companies will have, you know, 100 or 1000 shares in Tesco's.

00:05:04.200 --> 00:05:08.200
 I think there are a thousand shares in Tesco's chains.

00:05:08.200 --> 00:05:12.200
 I'm pretty sure I own more than a tenth of Tesco.

00:05:12.200 --> 00:05:19.200
 There is actually a big international argument about whether we keep the leap second though.

00:05:19.200 --> 00:05:23.200
 Because the US and France want to abolish leap seconds because they're incredibly annoying.

00:05:23.200 --> 00:05:29.200
 But Britain, Russia and China say that the technical challenges should be manageable, right?

00:05:29.200 --> 00:05:30.200
 We should be able to handle this.

00:05:30.200 --> 00:05:35.200
 But this last leap second, quite a few GPS receivers knocked out.

00:05:35.200 --> 00:05:40.200
 Apparently, in the 2012 one, Reddit was down for 40 minutes, which was incredible.

00:05:40.200 --> 00:05:49.200
 2015, Twitter, Pinterest and Instagram and Amazon were down for about an hour or something.

00:05:49.200 --> 00:05:53.200
 Did I not read that they had to ground all quantices flights for about an hour or something?

00:05:53.200 --> 00:05:54.200
 Yeah, it was 2012.

00:05:54.200 --> 00:06:01.200
 Their booking system went AWOL because the systems couldn't cope with this added second in the middle of the night.

00:06:01.200 --> 00:06:06.200
 There's a thing I don't know too much about this, but you guys, my Anna, was telling me this.

00:06:06.200 --> 00:06:10.200
 Someone I used to know.

00:06:10.200 --> 00:06:17.200
 Basically, obviously every planet has a different amount of day to Earth.

00:06:17.200 --> 00:06:18.200
 They're not all 24 hours.

00:06:18.200 --> 00:06:26.200
 So all the NASA scientists who working on the rovers on Mars have to adjust their clocks to be doing a work schedule on Mars time.

00:06:26.200 --> 00:06:28.200
 So they work on a Mars day.

00:06:28.200 --> 00:06:31.200
 It's like 26 hours or something.

00:06:31.200 --> 00:06:32.200
 It's not that different.

00:06:32.200 --> 00:06:33.200
 Yeah, it's not that different.

00:06:33.200 --> 00:06:36.200
 Yeah, but it starts to really mess you up.

00:06:36.200 --> 00:06:38.200
 I found a really cool measurement.

00:06:38.200 --> 00:06:44.200
 So I was looking into different measurements of time and found a few surprising ones that I didn't know were real things.

00:06:44.200 --> 00:06:48.200
 Like, for example, I would always hear an American say, "I'll be there in a jiffy."

00:06:48.200 --> 00:06:51.200
 I didn't know jiffy was an actual unit of time.

00:06:51.200 --> 00:06:52.200
 What?

00:06:52.200 --> 00:06:53.200
 Yeah, jiffy is an actual unit of time.

00:06:53.200 --> 00:06:55.200
 It's 0.1 seconds.

00:06:55.200 --> 00:06:56.200
 Really?

00:06:56.200 --> 00:06:57.200
 Yeah.

00:06:57.200 --> 00:06:58.200
 Another unit.

00:06:58.200 --> 00:07:01.200
 Do you guys know how long a moment is?

00:07:01.200 --> 00:07:06.200
 So I got this from a guy called Hagrid Hawks on Twitter.

00:07:06.200 --> 00:07:11.200
 In medieval Europe, 90 seconds is what a moment was defined as.

00:07:11.200 --> 00:07:12.200
 Okay.

00:07:12.200 --> 00:07:13.200
 Be there in a moment.

00:07:13.200 --> 00:07:14.200
 Of course.

00:07:14.200 --> 00:07:15.200
 See you in 90 seconds.

00:07:15.200 --> 00:07:16.200
 Is that right?

00:07:16.200 --> 00:07:18.200
 That's according to this guy.

00:07:18.200 --> 00:07:22.200
 He runs a really amazing blog about words that are no longer used.

00:07:22.200 --> 00:07:24.200
 It's a really nice kind of Twitter account.

00:07:24.200 --> 00:07:31.200
 I've heard once that a moment now is like three seconds or something.

00:07:31.200 --> 00:07:33.200
 That how long you have to be hugging someone for it to be uncomfortable?

00:07:33.200 --> 00:07:34.200
 Yeah, it is.

00:07:34.200 --> 00:07:35.200
 It was a similar study.

00:07:35.200 --> 00:07:37.200
 It was some kind of study about hugging.

00:07:37.200 --> 00:07:40.200
 And it was like how long the average hug is until it gets a bit awkward.

00:07:40.200 --> 00:07:43.200
 And they said it was a moment which is three seconds.

00:07:43.200 --> 00:07:47.200
 And then they said a lot of other things in your body also last for three seconds.

00:07:47.200 --> 00:07:49.200
 I can't remember what it was.

00:07:49.200 --> 00:07:52.200
 So I don't think it's universal because I think if James and I hugged it will be awkward

00:07:52.200 --> 00:08:04.200
 after about 0.2 seconds in a jiffy.

00:08:04.200 --> 00:08:05.200
 Okay.

00:08:05.200 --> 00:08:06.200
 Time for fact number two.

00:08:06.200 --> 00:08:08.200
 And that is James.

00:08:08.200 --> 00:08:09.200
 Okay.

00:08:09.200 --> 00:08:15.200
 My fact this week is that in 1457, men with mustaches were banned from Dublin.

00:08:15.200 --> 00:08:17.200
 This is such a cool place.

00:08:17.200 --> 00:08:18.200
 Why?

00:08:18.200 --> 00:08:20.200
 They didn't like Irish people.

00:08:20.200 --> 00:08:21.200
 Yes, it was Irish people.

00:08:21.200 --> 00:08:23.200
 Weirdly with it being Dublin.

00:08:23.200 --> 00:08:28.200
 But because Dublin was owned by the English at the time, just the area around Dublin,

00:08:28.200 --> 00:08:31.200
 the rest of Ireland was run by the Irish.

00:08:31.200 --> 00:08:33.200
 But the area around Dublin was run by the English.

00:08:33.200 --> 00:08:37.200
 It was called the Pale, which is where we get the phrase "beyond the Pale" for something that's crazy.

00:08:37.200 --> 00:08:40.200
 Something that was outside of this pale area.

00:08:40.200 --> 00:08:44.200
 And what they didn't want was Irish people in the town.

00:08:44.200 --> 00:08:48.200
 But if an Irishman did kind of get in there, how would you know it was him?

00:08:48.200 --> 00:08:50.200
 Well, they all had these mustaches.

00:08:50.200 --> 00:08:53.200
 So if there was an English person in the pale who had a mustache,

00:08:53.200 --> 00:08:56.200
 you didn't want him there because everyone would think he was Irish.

00:08:56.200 --> 00:08:57.200
 Right.

00:08:57.200 --> 00:08:58.200
 And that was a problem.

00:08:58.200 --> 00:09:04.200
 The ordnance said, men with baddies above the mouth were not allowed and baddies met beards.

00:09:04.200 --> 00:09:06.200
 So any beard above the mouth.

00:09:06.200 --> 00:09:08.200
 So you have a beard above the mouth, Dan.

00:09:08.200 --> 00:09:09.200
 No, I don't.

00:09:09.200 --> 00:09:11.200
 But he's also got a beard below the mouth.

00:09:11.200 --> 00:09:12.200
 He's got a beard.

00:09:12.200 --> 00:09:13.200
 I've got a bit of growth.

00:09:13.200 --> 00:09:14.200
 I wouldn't say it's fully formed.

00:09:14.200 --> 00:09:15.200
 That counts as a body to me.

00:09:15.200 --> 00:09:16.200
 Really?

00:09:16.200 --> 00:09:17.200
 I'm afraid so.

00:09:17.200 --> 00:09:19.200
 They even had a rule about this.

00:09:19.200 --> 00:09:24.200
 This same rule was so that the said let's be at least shaving within two weeks.

00:09:24.200 --> 00:09:27.200
 So if you haven't shaved for two weeks, that's what counts.

00:09:27.200 --> 00:09:29.200
 Amazingly at the time, they did not have a word form a stash.

00:09:29.200 --> 00:09:33.200
 So they had to say, if you have any beard above the mouth or hair on your upper lip,

00:09:33.200 --> 00:09:36.200
 they had no more concise way of saying the same.

00:09:36.200 --> 00:09:41.200
 One thing I love about this is I'm quite obsessed with facial hair and beards.

00:09:41.200 --> 00:09:45.200
 In the sense that I'm really fascinated by it because I can't have it myself.

00:09:45.200 --> 00:09:47.200
 I'm also fascinated by it and I don't really want it near me.

00:09:47.200 --> 00:09:49.200
 It's like nuclear power station.

00:09:49.200 --> 00:09:52.200
 I know that they're really great and lots of people like them.

00:09:52.200 --> 00:09:56.200
 But I just don't want one pressed up against my face.

00:09:56.200 --> 00:09:58.200
 It's like a nuclear power station.

00:09:58.200 --> 00:09:59.200
 Yeah, exactly.

00:09:59.200 --> 00:10:01.200
 But I'm absolutely obsessed with beards.

00:10:01.200 --> 00:10:03.200
 And I've got some adverts.

00:10:03.200 --> 00:10:10.200
 I dug up about quack beard growing as solutions that were sold by Victorian quacks

00:10:10.200 --> 00:10:13.200
 in order for people to grow a beard.

00:10:13.200 --> 00:10:16.200
 Because beards were supposed to be for health.

00:10:16.200 --> 00:10:19.200
 So they would filter out the bad air.

00:10:19.200 --> 00:10:25.200
 It was when people still thought that diseases were carried by bad smells instead of buying contact.

00:10:25.200 --> 00:10:29.200
 So you would stop the bad smells getting into your mouth, blah, blah, blah.

00:10:29.200 --> 00:10:31.200
 So people would get a beard on prescription.

00:10:31.200 --> 00:10:37.200
 And if they weren't able to grow a beard, they would get a beard generating liquid

00:10:37.200 --> 00:10:39.200
 that they could smother over themselves.

00:10:39.200 --> 00:10:40.200
 That's so funny.

00:10:40.200 --> 00:10:43.200
 So beards were like for health.

00:10:43.200 --> 00:10:44.200
 That's very cool.

00:10:44.200 --> 00:10:47.200
 But then they weren't really out of fashion at the end of Victorian times.

00:10:47.200 --> 00:10:48.200
 Yeah, yeah.

00:10:48.200 --> 00:10:52.200
 And there was a study in 1909 about how a moustache is harbour germs.

00:10:52.200 --> 00:10:54.200
 And this was the New York Times.

00:10:54.200 --> 00:10:56.200
 This was a French study they were quoting.

00:10:56.200 --> 00:10:58.200
 It said, "A Parisian," as in a female Parisian.

00:10:58.200 --> 00:11:02.200
 "Allowed herself to be kissed by a clean shaver man and then by a bearded man."

00:11:02.200 --> 00:11:06.200
 And the clean shaver man had left a small quantity of harmless particles.

00:11:06.200 --> 00:11:11.200
 His rivals kiss had colonized the lady's lips with the best alive tuberculosis,

00:11:11.200 --> 00:11:15.200
 diphtheria, pneumonia, and numerous other unpleasant microbes.

00:11:15.200 --> 00:11:17.200
 Where did they get this beard at that?

00:11:17.200 --> 00:11:20.200
 They just dredged him up from the saying.

00:11:20.200 --> 00:11:27.200
 This is brilliant because in the Journal of Hospital Infection,

00:11:27.200 --> 00:11:30.200
 they went and swabbed some men with beards and some men without beards.

00:11:30.200 --> 00:11:34.200
 And the men without beards had MRSA on their faces.

00:11:34.200 --> 00:11:37.200
 And the people with beards did not have MRSA.

00:11:37.200 --> 00:11:40.200
 Yeah, but they had tuberculosis.

00:11:40.200 --> 00:11:44.200
 Oh, give me, it's because the other but all the other bacteria.

00:11:44.200 --> 00:11:50.200
 They had tons of bacteria, but it was producing toxins that was then killing off the nasty effect.

00:11:50.200 --> 00:11:51.200
 It was good bacteria.

00:11:51.200 --> 00:11:52.200
 Yeah, so it was like penicillin.

00:11:52.200 --> 00:11:56.200
 Penicillin kills off other bacteria because it produces toxins.

00:11:56.200 --> 00:12:01.200
 I found a survey result from 2010 of what people in Britain

00:12:01.200 --> 00:12:04.200
 recognize as the most famous mustaches in the world.

00:12:04.200 --> 00:12:05.200
 I think there's one.

00:12:05.200 --> 00:12:07.200
 Interestingly, Hitler is not on the list.

00:12:07.200 --> 00:12:08.200
 You're kidding.

00:12:08.200 --> 00:12:09.200
 Hitler's not on the list.

00:12:09.200 --> 00:12:10.200
 Fix.

00:12:10.200 --> 00:12:11.200
 Yeah, total fix.

00:12:11.200 --> 00:12:12.200
 Total fix.

00:12:12.200 --> 00:12:14.200
 So, in at number one, we're 24%.

00:12:14.200 --> 00:12:15.200
 Chaplin.

00:12:15.200 --> 00:12:17.200
 No. Chaplin is in at five.

00:12:17.200 --> 00:12:18.200
 Give us a clue.

00:12:18.200 --> 00:12:19.200
 Clue artist.

00:12:19.200 --> 00:12:20.200
 Darlie.

00:12:20.200 --> 00:12:21.200
 Darlie.

00:12:21.200 --> 00:12:22.200
 Darlie.

00:12:22.200 --> 00:12:25.200
 The Picasso moustache famed.

00:12:25.200 --> 00:12:26.200
 You panicked.

00:12:26.200 --> 00:12:27.200
 I did.

00:12:27.200 --> 00:12:29.200
 I could see Andy was going for it.

00:12:29.200 --> 00:12:32.200
 I was like, I need to get in here fast.

00:12:32.200 --> 00:12:33.200
 Oh, my God.

00:12:33.200 --> 00:12:35.200
 And just quickly at number two in an 18%.

00:12:35.200 --> 00:12:36.200
 The Picasso.

00:12:36.200 --> 00:12:37.200
 No.

00:12:37.200 --> 00:12:38.200
 Clue.

00:12:38.200 --> 00:12:40.200
 We need a clue.

00:12:40.200 --> 00:12:41.200
 Clue sportsman.

00:12:41.200 --> 00:12:42.200
 No.

00:12:42.200 --> 00:12:44.200
 Big daddy and haystacks with the white moustache.

00:12:44.200 --> 00:12:45.200
 Whatever.

00:12:45.200 --> 00:12:47.200
 The one with the wrestler with the white moustache.

00:12:47.200 --> 00:12:48.200
 Yes.

00:12:48.200 --> 00:12:49.200
 You got it.

00:12:49.200 --> 00:12:50.200
 Hulk Hogan.

00:12:50.200 --> 00:12:51.200
 Hulk Hogan.

00:12:51.200 --> 00:12:53.200
 Hitler's moustache is way more famous than Hulk Hogan.

00:12:53.200 --> 00:12:54.200
 He was definitely.

00:12:54.200 --> 00:12:55.200
 Yeah.

00:12:55.200 --> 00:12:57.200
 Well, someone else moustache on the list of most famous moustaches,

00:12:57.200 --> 00:13:00.200
 which is the South Korean striker Kang Soo-il,

00:13:00.200 --> 00:13:03.200
 who very recently was suspended for 15 matches

00:13:03.200 --> 00:13:07.200
 because he was found to have steroids in his system,

00:13:07.200 --> 00:13:10.200
 which he blamed on a moustache growing cream

00:13:10.200 --> 00:13:12.200
 that he had been applying to his face.

00:13:12.200 --> 00:13:13.200
 Yeah.

00:13:13.200 --> 00:13:15.200
 Did you say Korean football player?

00:13:15.200 --> 00:13:16.200
 Yeah, yeah.

00:13:16.200 --> 00:13:17.200
 Okay.

00:13:17.200 --> 00:13:19.200
 Because I've got the same thing as a Japanese football player.

00:13:19.200 --> 00:13:21.200
 Well, a few years later.

00:13:21.200 --> 00:13:22.200
 No.

00:13:22.200 --> 00:13:24.200
 The Japanese rugby player was the World Cup.

00:13:24.200 --> 00:13:25.200
 Yeah.

00:13:25.200 --> 00:13:26.200
 Exactly for the same reason.

00:13:26.200 --> 00:13:28.200
 He said he was trying to grow a moustache.

00:13:28.200 --> 00:13:31.200
 And he was using this kind of thing that had, yeah.

00:13:31.200 --> 00:13:35.200
 It seems that I've never heard of a modern-day moustache cream.

00:13:35.200 --> 00:13:37.200
 Yet in Korea and Japan, apparently, this is a thing.

00:13:37.200 --> 00:13:39.200
 Clearly, if they're using it as an excuse,

00:13:39.200 --> 00:13:42.200
 then it has at least some traction there.

00:13:42.200 --> 00:13:43.200
 Yeah.

00:13:43.200 --> 00:13:46.200
 There are a group of people in Japan called the A-News.

00:13:46.200 --> 00:13:49.200
 (Laughter)

00:13:49.200 --> 00:13:50.200
 Greg.

00:13:50.200 --> 00:13:52.200
 Greg, what's wrong with you?

00:13:52.200 --> 00:13:53.200
 Greg.

00:13:53.200 --> 00:13:56.200
 And they're heavily moustached, often.

00:13:56.200 --> 00:13:57.200
 (Laughter)

00:13:57.200 --> 00:13:59.200
 So they're hairy A-News.

00:13:59.200 --> 00:14:01.200
 (Laughter)

00:14:01.200 --> 00:14:02.200
 Honestly.

00:14:02.200 --> 00:14:04.200
 So they're A-News.

00:14:04.200 --> 00:14:06.200
 They have these really long moustaches.

00:14:06.200 --> 00:14:10.200
 And they are often said to carry a moustache stick around

00:14:10.200 --> 00:14:12.200
 to lift the moustache when they're eating,

00:14:12.200 --> 00:14:15.200
 so they don't get Guinness or whatever inside the moustaches.

00:14:15.200 --> 00:14:16.200
 That's very cool.

00:14:16.200 --> 00:14:19.200
 Now, it was first described by a guy called Edward S. Moss

00:14:19.200 --> 00:14:22.200
 when he went around Japan in the 19th century.

00:14:22.200 --> 00:14:24.200
 But it turns out that it isn't a moustache stick.

00:14:24.200 --> 00:14:27.200
 It's a prayer stick, but they do use it to lift their moustaches.

00:14:27.200 --> 00:14:28.200
 So it kind of is a moustache stick.

00:14:28.200 --> 00:14:29.200
 Oh, okay.

00:14:29.200 --> 00:14:30.200
 What's a prayer stick?

00:14:30.200 --> 00:14:33.200
 It's a stick you use for praying.

00:14:33.200 --> 00:14:34.200
 (Laughter)

00:14:34.200 --> 00:14:36.200
 Is it like an antenna to God?

00:14:36.200 --> 00:14:37.200
 I don't know.

00:14:37.200 --> 00:14:41.200
 I imagine it would be like, you know, like prayer bowls in Buddhist countries

00:14:41.200 --> 00:14:44.200
 where you kind of, you would take the bowl

00:14:44.200 --> 00:14:45.200
 and you would make it make a ringing noise,

00:14:45.200 --> 00:14:47.200
 and it would help you meditate or something.

00:14:47.200 --> 00:14:49.200
 I imagine it was like that, but I really don't know.

00:14:49.200 --> 00:14:52.200
 They did use to have, I think it was back in the Victorian times,

00:14:52.200 --> 00:14:56.200
 a set of mugs and so on, where they had moustache catchers.

00:14:56.200 --> 00:15:00.200
 So you'd place your moustache into it as part of the porcelain,

00:15:00.200 --> 00:15:01.200
 and there would be a...

00:15:01.200 --> 00:15:03.200
 I think the anus had those as well.

00:15:03.200 --> 00:15:04.200
 (Laughter)

00:15:04.200 --> 00:15:05.200
 I think so.

00:15:05.200 --> 00:15:06.200
 So maybe that's where...

00:15:06.200 --> 00:15:07.200
 That was big.

00:15:07.200 --> 00:15:09.200
 Yeah, we had some of those on QI TV show.

00:15:09.200 --> 00:15:10.200
 Oh, really?

00:15:10.200 --> 00:15:12.200
 And some of the spoons as well, which have a little hole.

00:15:12.200 --> 00:15:14.200
 So it's like a normal spoon, except it's got a cap over it

00:15:14.200 --> 00:15:15.200
 with a hole cut out of it.

00:15:15.200 --> 00:15:18.200
 So you can pour soup onto one half of the spoon

00:15:18.200 --> 00:15:20.200
 and then strain it through the hole.

00:15:20.200 --> 00:15:21.200
 So you get none of the other stuff.

00:15:21.200 --> 00:15:22.200
 Wow.

00:15:22.200 --> 00:15:25.200
 That sounds incredibly practical, just from a kind of sippy cup perspective.

00:15:25.200 --> 00:15:26.200
 Yeah.

00:15:26.200 --> 00:15:28.200
 But to have that would mean you...

00:15:28.200 --> 00:15:29.200
 I do.

00:15:29.200 --> 00:15:30.200
 I'd like one by itself.

00:15:30.200 --> 00:15:31.200
 Yeah, I'd love one.

00:15:31.200 --> 00:15:33.200
 I've got another stick beard fact.

00:15:33.200 --> 00:15:34.200
 Okay.

00:15:34.200 --> 00:15:37.200
 Fatal hair stick fact, which is...

00:15:37.200 --> 00:15:40.200
 We've mentioned the popularity of beards in Victorian times.

00:15:40.200 --> 00:15:43.200
 In the early Victorian times they're incredibly unpopular,

00:15:43.200 --> 00:15:47.200
 and then they kind of reached peak beard in kind of 1890s.

00:15:47.200 --> 00:15:52.200
 But to give you an example, in the 1840s,

00:15:52.200 --> 00:15:54.200
 only one member of Parliament had a beard.

00:15:54.200 --> 00:15:55.200
 Wow.

00:15:55.200 --> 00:15:57.200
 And it was George Frederick Munt.

00:15:57.200 --> 00:15:59.200
 And this was really extraordinary,

00:15:59.200 --> 00:16:01.200
 not just because it looked like a toilet brush attached

00:16:01.200 --> 00:16:03.200
 to the bottom of his face.

00:16:03.200 --> 00:16:06.200
 But at the time, beards were the mark of a tramp,

00:16:06.200 --> 00:16:08.200
 revolutionary or charlatan.

00:16:08.200 --> 00:16:10.200
 So he used to carry a stick with him.

00:16:10.200 --> 00:16:11.200
 And I've got this...

00:16:11.200 --> 00:16:13.200
 Although he was a large man,

00:16:13.200 --> 00:16:16.200
 he would carry a stiff cane with him at all times

00:16:16.200 --> 00:16:19.200
 to answer any insult he encountered on the streets,

00:16:19.200 --> 00:16:22.200
 from people who accused him of being either a crank

00:16:22.200 --> 00:16:25.200
 or an artist.

00:16:25.200 --> 00:16:31.200
 I thought I'd look at some other things that happened in 1457.

00:16:31.200 --> 00:16:33.200
 Oh, cool.

00:16:33.200 --> 00:16:35.200
 Just a few things.

00:16:35.200 --> 00:16:39.200
 Pope Paul II died in a melon-induced apoplexy.

00:16:39.200 --> 00:16:41.200
 We've all been there.

00:16:41.200 --> 00:16:42.200
 Incredible.

00:16:42.200 --> 00:16:45.200
 So this is Anna, who I should introduce you guys to one day.

00:16:45.200 --> 00:16:48.200
 She didn't do a big thing,

00:16:48.200 --> 00:16:51.200
 where she found melon overdose was a massive thing

00:16:51.200 --> 00:16:52.200
 back around this time.

00:16:52.200 --> 00:16:53.200
 She loves it.

00:16:53.200 --> 00:16:54.200
 Yeah.

00:16:54.200 --> 00:16:56.200
 She found like ten people, kings and popes

00:16:56.200 --> 00:16:58.200
 and yeah, all died from melon overdose.

00:16:58.200 --> 00:16:59.200
 What about how?

00:16:59.200 --> 00:17:00.200
 Is it like...

00:17:00.200 --> 00:17:01.200
 It goes...

00:17:01.200 --> 00:17:03.200
 I think it was surely something else.

00:17:03.200 --> 00:17:05.200
 Obviously it was something else.

00:17:05.200 --> 00:17:06.200
 Yeah.

00:17:06.200 --> 00:17:07.200
 Some of the things.

00:17:07.200 --> 00:17:10.200
 Vlad the Impaler made his first raid into Transylvania

00:17:10.200 --> 00:17:11.200
 in that year.

00:17:11.200 --> 00:17:15.200
 Golf was banned by James II of Scotland.

00:17:15.200 --> 00:17:19.200
 And in 1457, a cell, a pig was convicted of murder

00:17:19.200 --> 00:17:23.200
 and sentenced to be hanged by the hanged feet from a gallows.

00:17:23.200 --> 00:17:26.200
 Her six piglets were found to be accomplices,

00:17:26.200 --> 00:17:28.200
 but as no evidence was offered against them,

00:17:28.200 --> 00:17:31.200
 and in account of their tender age, they were acquitted.

00:17:31.200 --> 00:17:33.200
 Wait, but being hanged by your hanged feet,

00:17:33.200 --> 00:17:36.200
 wouldn't that be just like a bungee jump?

00:17:37.200 --> 00:17:45.200
 Okay, it's time for fact number three.

00:17:45.200 --> 00:17:47.200
 And that is my fact.

00:17:47.200 --> 00:17:51.200
 My fact this week is that Diplodocuses could break the sound barrier.

00:17:51.200 --> 00:17:53.200
 The dinosaur.

00:17:53.200 --> 00:17:55.200
 It was so fast.

00:17:55.200 --> 00:17:57.200
 Yeah.

00:17:57.200 --> 00:17:59.200
 Was this like a...

00:17:59.200 --> 00:18:02.200
 The day's we sure to sound, traveled a lot slower.

00:18:02.200 --> 00:18:03.200
 I know.

00:18:03.200 --> 00:18:07.200
 So the actual answer is that they had a little whipping system

00:18:07.200 --> 00:18:09.200
 at the end of their tail.

00:18:09.200 --> 00:18:12.200
 And they would whip it so fast that it would break the sound barrier,

00:18:12.200 --> 00:18:14.200
 a little sonic boom created.

00:18:14.200 --> 00:18:17.200
 And we know this apparently, according to scientists,

00:18:17.200 --> 00:18:20.200
 because they've been doing these computer simulations

00:18:20.200 --> 00:18:22.200
 where they've been recreating the dinosaurs.

00:18:22.200 --> 00:18:25.200
 And one of the consequences of putting this thing together,

00:18:25.200 --> 00:18:29.200
 the simulation is that when the dinosaurs tailed this movement,

00:18:29.200 --> 00:18:32.200
 it moved at such a speed that it breaks the sound barrier.

00:18:32.200 --> 00:18:34.200
 We don't have Diplodocuses to check it out on.

00:18:34.200 --> 00:18:36.200
 But supposedly they broke the sound barrier.

00:18:36.200 --> 00:18:39.200
 I find something crazy that's something that lot.

00:18:39.200 --> 00:18:41.200
 Because I think, unless I've made it up,

00:18:41.200 --> 00:18:45.200
 there are a few sort of smaller animals that can break the sound barrier.

00:18:45.200 --> 00:18:47.200
 But outside of that, I've never heard of something natural,

00:18:47.200 --> 00:18:50.200
 a living thing breaking the sound barrier.

00:18:50.200 --> 00:18:52.200
 Isn't there...

00:18:52.200 --> 00:18:53.200
 Is the shrimp?

00:18:53.200 --> 00:18:54.200
 Yeah, mantish shrimp.

00:18:54.200 --> 00:18:55.200
 That's one I'm thinking.

00:18:55.200 --> 00:18:58.200
 But it doesn't move faster than the sound barrier.

00:18:58.200 --> 00:19:01.200
 It clicks with its claws and it creates a bubble which breaks the sound barrier.

00:19:01.200 --> 00:19:03.200
 Oh, is that correct?

00:19:03.200 --> 00:19:04.200
 That sounds a bit right.

00:19:04.200 --> 00:19:06.200
 Okay, so then that shouldn't count.

00:19:06.200 --> 00:19:09.200
 Yeah, in terms of the animal moving itself, yeah.

00:19:09.200 --> 00:19:10.200
 It's fantastic.

00:19:10.200 --> 00:19:11.200
 And it's a Diplodocus.

00:19:11.200 --> 00:19:12.200
 I mean, that's...

00:19:12.200 --> 00:19:14.200
 Well, I think it's a Diplodocus, isn't it?

00:19:14.200 --> 00:19:15.200
 Well, ah.

00:19:15.200 --> 00:19:16.200
 I say Diplodocus.

00:19:16.200 --> 00:19:17.200
 I say Diplodocus.

00:19:17.200 --> 00:19:18.200
 I say Diplodocus.

00:19:18.200 --> 00:19:21.200
 A lot of people say Diplodocus, and that's the American pronunciation.

00:19:21.200 --> 00:19:23.200
 Two scientists around here say...

00:19:23.200 --> 00:19:26.200
 Yeah, but dance in Jurassic Park a lot.

00:19:26.200 --> 00:19:28.200
 I would trust exactly this judgement.

00:19:28.200 --> 00:19:34.200
 Well, because the word Diplodocus was invented by an American and he pronounced it Diplodocus.

00:19:34.200 --> 00:19:37.200
 I think we're supposed to pronounce it Diplodocus.

00:19:37.200 --> 00:19:41.200
 But actually, I do concede that Diplodocus is a nicer word.

00:19:41.200 --> 00:19:45.200
 Well, there's a BBC news correspondent called Susan Ray.

00:19:45.200 --> 00:19:52.200
 And she went round serving what people thought it was amongst academics to get the best understanding of it.

00:19:52.200 --> 00:19:55.200
 And what she actually came out with, I think there was a different advance.

00:19:55.200 --> 00:20:01.200
 But I got more interested in the sideline thing she found out, which is that there's actually four pronunciations of it.

00:20:01.200 --> 00:20:03.200
 So it's not just the two that we know.

00:20:03.200 --> 00:20:04.200
 Okay.

00:20:04.200 --> 00:20:07.200
 There's dip, load, doke, us.

00:20:07.200 --> 00:20:09.200
 That's how I say it.

00:20:09.200 --> 00:20:10.200
 Yeah.

00:20:10.200 --> 00:20:12.200
 That's speed as well.

00:20:12.200 --> 00:20:14.200
 Is there a Diplodocus?

00:20:14.200 --> 00:20:15.200
 Oh, yeah, yeah.

00:20:15.200 --> 00:20:16.200
 Diplodocus.

00:20:16.200 --> 00:20:17.200
 Yeah.

00:20:17.200 --> 00:20:18.200
 So that one as well.

00:20:18.200 --> 00:20:19.200
 That's the fourth.

00:20:19.200 --> 00:20:20.200
 Sorry, yeah.

00:20:20.200 --> 00:20:21.200
 I meant Diplodocus.

00:20:21.200 --> 00:20:28.200
 But that would imply that there's a single animal called a plodocus, which is twice as big.

00:20:28.200 --> 00:20:29.200
 Yeah.

00:20:29.200 --> 00:20:31.200
 So there's four pronunciations, apparently.

00:20:31.200 --> 00:20:32.200
 What was the fourth one?

00:20:32.200 --> 00:20:36.200
 I think the one I just said, dip, load, doke, us.

00:20:36.200 --> 00:20:39.200
 Doke, us.

00:20:39.200 --> 00:20:41.200
 So this was by a BBC journalist.

00:20:41.200 --> 00:20:42.200
 Yeah.

00:20:42.200 --> 00:20:43.200
 Due to the unique way that BBC is funded.

00:20:43.200 --> 00:20:45.200
 We now know that there were four.

00:20:45.200 --> 00:20:47.200
 But Dan hasn't told us which is the one.

00:20:47.200 --> 00:20:53.200
 Well, as I said, I got so interested in the four pronunciations, I didn't look into the one that actually won.

00:20:53.200 --> 00:20:55.200
 And it was named after Andrew Carnegie.

00:20:55.200 --> 00:21:02.200
 One of the first dinosaur specimens was named after Andrew Diplodocus Carnegie.

00:21:02.200 --> 00:21:05.200
 Yeah, look, the one of the most wealthy men ever.

00:21:05.200 --> 00:21:06.200
 Yeah.

00:21:06.200 --> 00:21:08.200
 Could you explain how it was named after him, though?

00:21:08.200 --> 00:21:12.200
 Well, it was called Diplodocus Carnegie, the first specimen.

00:21:12.200 --> 00:21:14.200
 Yeah, the scientific name it was given.

00:21:14.200 --> 00:21:15.200
 Yeah, yeah.

00:21:15.200 --> 00:21:16.200
 He invested a lot of money.

00:21:16.200 --> 00:21:20.200
 I think he gave Diplodocus to the natural history museum, the plaster cast.

00:21:20.200 --> 00:21:22.200
 It was him who presented it.

00:21:22.200 --> 00:21:23.200
 Yeah, yeah.

00:21:23.200 --> 00:21:27.200
 And he was very instrumental in spreading the amazing news about this dinosaur around the world.

00:21:27.200 --> 00:21:28.200
 He was fascinated by them.

00:21:28.200 --> 00:21:29.200
 Yeah.

00:21:29.200 --> 00:21:30.200
 That's it.

00:21:30.200 --> 00:21:36.200
 Just speaking of Dippy, so Dippy obviously originally had a different tale.

00:21:36.200 --> 00:21:38.200
 I think it was on the ground.

00:21:38.200 --> 00:21:44.200
 And then they realized that Diplodocuses probably had them raised up, so they had to redo it.

00:21:44.200 --> 00:21:46.200
 So they had to do remolding of it.

00:21:46.200 --> 00:21:47.200
 Yeah.

00:21:47.200 --> 00:21:54.200
 So the person who did the molding of it was the same guy who did Jabba the Hut for Return of the Jedi.

00:21:54.200 --> 00:21:55.200
 Really?

00:21:55.200 --> 00:21:56.200
 Yeah.

00:21:56.200 --> 00:21:57.200
 His name is John Coppinger.

00:21:57.200 --> 00:21:58.200
 That's a great idea.

00:21:58.200 --> 00:21:59.200
 That's pretty cool.

00:21:59.200 --> 00:22:00.200
 Yeah.

00:22:00.200 --> 00:22:03.200
 I know this because someone we work with Steve helped to work on it.

00:22:03.200 --> 00:22:06.200
 So this guy not only did Dippy, but he did Jabba the Hut.

00:22:06.200 --> 00:22:11.200
 And he did a lot of the aliens in fifth element and Harry Potter and so on.

00:22:11.200 --> 00:22:13.200
 Well, I love the aliens in Harry Potter.

00:22:13.200 --> 00:22:14.200
 It was so good.

00:22:14.200 --> 00:22:18.200
 It was a curveball, but it was the right moment.

00:22:18.200 --> 00:22:25.200
 I've got a dinosaur nemmy toy, which is that it was a couple of years ago.

00:22:25.200 --> 00:22:33.200
 A new species, completely new species of terrasaur, has been named after a nine-year-old girl

00:22:33.200 --> 00:22:37.200
 who found the phospholose bones on a beach in the Isle of White.

00:22:37.200 --> 00:22:44.200
 And the species is called Vectid Rayco, which means terrasaur, means dragon from the Isle of White.

00:22:44.200 --> 00:22:49.200
 And the second word is Daisy Morrisay, because her name is Daisy Morris.

00:22:49.200 --> 00:22:54.200
 So she's a nine-year-old girl who has a dinosaur named after her because she found the bones, she collected them up.

00:22:54.200 --> 00:22:55.200
 She handed them in.

00:22:55.200 --> 00:22:56.200
 That's pretty cool.

00:22:56.200 --> 00:22:57.200
 Best bit about this.

00:22:57.200 --> 00:22:59.200
 When she actually found them, she was only four years old.

00:22:59.200 --> 00:23:00.200
 Wow.

00:23:00.200 --> 00:23:02.200
 And she started phosphol hunting at the age of three.

00:23:02.200 --> 00:23:06.200
 I've been looking for fossils in the Isle of White as well, and I've never found any terrasaur.

00:23:06.200 --> 00:23:09.200
 Bloody Daisy Morrisay for that first.

00:23:09.200 --> 00:23:13.200
 She's had years head start, she's been going for like ten years.

00:23:13.200 --> 00:23:15.200
 But I'm more older than her.

00:23:15.200 --> 00:23:17.200
 My eyesight might not be as good as it used to be.

00:23:17.200 --> 00:23:19.200
 I have to think she's closer to the ground.

00:23:19.200 --> 00:23:23.200
 You can't move as fast on the uncertain terrain, James.

00:23:23.200 --> 00:23:26.200
 I was reading about the sound barrier and breaking the sound barrier.

00:23:26.200 --> 00:23:29.200
 The first man to break the sound barrier is still alive, which I did not know.

00:23:29.200 --> 00:23:31.200
 Chuck Yeager, right name.

00:23:31.200 --> 00:23:32.200
 That's amazing name.

00:23:32.200 --> 00:23:35.200
 And he was 24 when he became the first man to break the sound barrier.

00:23:35.200 --> 00:23:37.200
 It's really, that's for what?

00:23:37.200 --> 00:23:38.200
 89 now?

00:23:38.200 --> 00:23:39.200
 He's 92.

00:23:39.200 --> 00:23:40.200
 92.

00:23:40.200 --> 00:23:41.200
 Yeah.

00:23:41.200 --> 00:23:45.200
 And he, because he used to be a fighter pilot, he thought he flew in the second world war.

00:23:45.200 --> 00:23:49.200
 And he had amazing adventures as you would expect, because he was a fighter pilot.

00:23:49.200 --> 00:23:50.200
 Yeah.

00:23:50.200 --> 00:23:53.200
 And I was just reading, this is all very publicly, this is on the Wikipedia about him.

00:23:53.200 --> 00:23:59.200
 He, on the 12th of October, 1944, he downed five enemy aircraft at a single mission, which is good, I believe.

00:23:59.200 --> 00:24:03.200
 Like you saying, you would expect it with him being a fighter pilot.

00:24:03.200 --> 00:24:06.200
 You would be the worst audience for his stories with you.

00:24:06.200 --> 00:24:09.200
 He's like, I was in the war and I shot down all these enemies.

00:24:09.200 --> 00:24:12.200
 And you're like, well, I would expect that you're a fighter pilot.

00:24:12.200 --> 00:24:16.200
 I want to tell you what happened on the 12th of October, 1944.

00:24:16.200 --> 00:24:18.200
 So this is the exact sentence.

00:24:18.200 --> 00:24:20.200
 Two of these kills out of five in a day.

00:24:20.200 --> 00:24:23.200
 Two of these kills were scored without firing a single shot.

00:24:23.200 --> 00:24:26.200
 When he flew into firing position against a Mecha Smith 109,

00:24:26.200 --> 00:24:30.200
 the pilot of the aircraft panicked, breaking the starboard and colliding with his wingman.

00:24:30.200 --> 00:24:33.200
 Whoa, how cool is that?

00:24:33.200 --> 00:24:35.200
 You just have to turn and fake it.

00:24:35.200 --> 00:24:36.200
 Yeah, they both parachuted up.

00:24:36.200 --> 00:24:37.200
 I said they survived.

00:24:37.200 --> 00:24:41.200
 So 92, I follow him on Facebook.

00:24:41.200 --> 00:24:43.200
 He's a very active Facebook user, yeah.

00:24:43.200 --> 00:24:45.200
 Yeah, Chuck Yeager loves Facebook.

00:24:45.200 --> 00:24:46.200
 That's amazing.

00:24:46.200 --> 00:24:50.200
 Breaking the social media barrier.

00:24:50.200 --> 00:24:59.200
 Wasn't this supposedly a story about, was it Kittinger or someone who maybe broke the sound barrier before him doing a free fall from extremely, extremely high?

00:24:59.200 --> 00:25:03.200
 And the idea being that he went so fast.

00:25:03.200 --> 00:25:07.200
 And with the air being so thin up there, the sound barrier is a bit less.

00:25:07.200 --> 00:25:10.200
 That maybe he did break the sound barrier.

00:25:10.200 --> 00:25:13.200
 Wow, there are loads of earlier claims.

00:25:13.200 --> 00:25:16.200
 And they didn't have very accurate instruments and things like that.

00:25:16.200 --> 00:25:22.200
 Also, the last time that Chuck Yeager broke the sound barrier was on the 50th anniversary of the first time.

00:25:22.200 --> 00:25:25.200
 He flew a plane at the age of 74 past Mack one.

00:25:25.200 --> 00:25:28.200
 There's a picture of him sitting on his Facebook page.

00:25:28.200 --> 00:25:33.200
 I'm going to go and poke him after this podcast.

00:25:33.200 --> 00:25:37.200
 We were talking on last week's podcast about the Concord.

00:25:37.200 --> 00:25:39.200
 And so that obviously breaks the sound barrier.

00:25:39.200 --> 00:25:42.200
 And you pointed at Andy that they're not allowed to do it over cities.

00:25:42.200 --> 00:25:48.200
 And I had no idea because the boom is so great that it would actually just be incredibly noisy.

00:25:48.200 --> 00:25:50.200
 But actually it goes beyond noise.

00:25:50.200 --> 00:25:52.200
 There was an accidental sonic boom.

00:25:52.200 --> 00:25:55.200
 A sound barrier breaking that happened.

00:25:55.200 --> 00:25:58.200
 And how do you pronounce this place? I know it's Aberist with.

00:25:58.200 --> 00:25:59.200
 Aberist with.

00:25:59.200 --> 00:26:02.200
 There are actually four ways of pronouncing it.

00:26:02.200 --> 00:26:06.200
 There's a brisk with.

00:26:06.200 --> 00:26:09.200
 So a jet was flying over and it broke the sound barrier.

00:26:09.200 --> 00:26:13.200
 And it was so loud that everyone thought that a bomb had gone off.

00:26:13.200 --> 00:26:16.200
 Windows in shops shattered.

00:26:16.200 --> 00:26:17.200
 Wow.

00:26:17.200 --> 00:26:18.200
 They just blew out completely.

00:26:18.200 --> 00:26:22.200
 People were terrified and they genuinely thought something had exploded.

00:26:22.200 --> 00:26:23.200
 That's incredible.

00:26:23.200 --> 00:26:24.200
 That's amazing.

00:26:24.200 --> 00:26:27.200
 Yeah, night shift worker Greg Babelicki said.

00:26:27.200 --> 00:26:30.200
 I was just falling asleep and the sonic boom happened.

00:26:30.200 --> 00:26:31.200
 Keep it down, please.

00:26:31.200 --> 00:26:37.200
 Isn't that what happened with the meteorite and Chellabinsk as well?

00:26:37.200 --> 00:26:41.200
 It broke the sound barrier and it caused a massive kind of smashing of windows and stuff.

00:26:41.200 --> 00:26:42.200
 Wow.

00:26:42.200 --> 00:26:46.200
 So when the dinosaurs were wiped out allegedly by this giant meteor,

00:26:46.200 --> 00:26:49.200
 were they all just like, wow, there's diplodicus.

00:26:49.200 --> 00:26:55.200
 Wip it out there, tell us what.

00:26:55.200 --> 00:26:59.200
 OK, time for our final fact of the show and that is Andrew Hunter Murray.

00:26:59.200 --> 00:27:04.200
 My fact is that more and more scientists are describing their findings as astounding.

00:27:04.200 --> 00:27:10.200
 So this is a study of scientific papers from the last 40 odd years

00:27:10.200 --> 00:27:15.200
 and it's by the researchers at the University Medical Centre of Utrecht.

00:27:15.200 --> 00:27:17.200
 Utrecht in the Netherlands?

00:27:17.200 --> 00:27:20.200
 There were actually four different ways to pronounce it.

00:27:20.200 --> 00:27:25.200
 And so they found that in scientific papers that have published more and more researchers

00:27:25.200 --> 00:27:30.200
 and scientists are putting positive words like novel or amazing or spectacular

00:27:30.200 --> 00:27:33.200
 into descriptions of their works.

00:27:33.200 --> 00:27:36.200
 And they're also using other descriptive words, more a bit more.

00:27:36.200 --> 00:27:41.200
 So amazing, assuring, astonishing, bright, creative, encouraging, enormous, excellent,

00:27:41.200 --> 00:27:45.200
 groundbreaking, innovative, phenomenal reassuring.

00:27:45.200 --> 00:27:49.200
 And robust and spectacular and unique and unprecedented.

00:27:49.200 --> 00:27:54.200
 And novel, the word novel now appears in 7% of papers in PubMed,

00:27:54.200 --> 00:27:56.200
 which is this huge online database of papers.

00:27:56.200 --> 00:28:03.200
 And the researchers have jokingly said that at this rate, every paper will be described as that by the 21-23.

00:28:03.200 --> 00:28:09.200
 There was a guy who wrote a book about weird newspaper articles from the 19th century

00:28:09.200 --> 00:28:16.200
 and he, I think, searched for a singular coincidence or a singular example of something

00:28:16.200 --> 00:28:21.200
 which obviously should mean it only ever happened once, but they used it all the time in the Victorian times.

00:28:21.200 --> 00:28:22.200
 That's great.

00:28:22.200 --> 00:28:26.200
 Who was saying, was it some, one of you who was saying about Sherlock Holmes stories the other day?

00:28:26.200 --> 00:28:30.200
 I was talking to someone about this and they pointed out that every single Sherlock Holmes story

00:28:30.200 --> 00:28:35.200
 starts with Watson saying, "In all the cases we ever dealt with, this was the most singular."

00:28:35.200 --> 00:28:44.200
 So there are a couple of flaws in the study because it's based on certain words, so it doesn't take into account all language.

00:28:44.200 --> 00:28:49.200
 But they do think that it genuinely highlights an actual problem with scientific language.

00:28:49.200 --> 00:28:50.200
 But is it a problem?

00:28:50.200 --> 00:28:58.200
 Is it a problem that scientific papers are using the language of discovery for their discoveries?

00:28:58.200 --> 00:28:59.200
 Yes, good point.

00:28:59.200 --> 00:29:08.200
 Good point. I'm on your side, actually. I read a headline that was "Scientists left" and then this is the quote, "Gobsmacked by astounding Pluto images."

00:29:08.200 --> 00:29:12.200
 So, yeah, you would be gobsmacked and astounded by Pluto images.

00:29:12.200 --> 00:29:17.200
 Yeah, but I don't think you would be if you had sent a camera to look at Pluto.

00:29:17.200 --> 00:29:22.200
 It's still, if you'd be gobsmacked if you'd never sent a camera to Pluto, then the images are right.

00:29:22.200 --> 00:29:30.200
 This is typical of you, Andy. Well, you would expect that, you work with Pluto.

00:29:30.200 --> 00:29:36.200
 So the word astounding comes from thunder, tonnere, and it means light to leave something, thunder struck.

00:29:36.200 --> 00:29:38.200
 Where does the word gobsmacked come from?

00:29:38.200 --> 00:29:41.200
 I think it's just been smacked in the gobs.

00:29:41.200 --> 00:29:44.200
 There's another cool thing about scientific language.

00:29:44.200 --> 00:29:49.200
 So they've analysing scientific language, looking at word frequencies and things.

00:29:49.200 --> 00:29:56.200
 There was a scientist called Dietrich Stapel, who got the nickname "The Lion Dutchman."

00:29:56.200 --> 00:30:03.200
 In 2011, he admitted that he made up a lot of data. He's a psychology researcher.

00:30:03.200 --> 00:30:12.200
 And researchers at Cornell University in New York looked at his papers and they knew which ones were fake and which ones the data was fake and which it was real.

00:30:12.200 --> 00:30:21.200
 They worked out that he used more science-related terms to describe his methods when he was writing up fraudulent findings and when he was writing up real ones.

00:30:21.200 --> 00:30:29.200
 So they can identify to 70% accuracy, which is a long way to go, but they can identify when he's lying, which is interesting.

00:30:29.200 --> 00:30:32.200
 So if that could be rolled out to other forms of language, that would be amazing.

00:30:32.200 --> 00:30:34.200
 For forensic linguistics.

00:30:34.200 --> 00:30:47.200
 There are certain tricks, I don't know them all, in interrogation where you can study not the content of the responses, but the word count of responses.

00:30:47.200 --> 00:30:54.200
 It's a certain police technique where you're not really listening to the answers, but you're listening to the number of repeated words.

00:30:54.200 --> 00:30:55.200
 They're using.

00:30:55.200 --> 00:31:08.200
 I did it. I did it. I did it. I did it. I did it. I did it. I did it. No, it's because if you were at a scene and you were actually there, then you don't have to draw on your imagination as much.

00:31:08.200 --> 00:31:10.200
 So you use a different--

00:31:10.200 --> 00:31:11.200
 That's so clever.

00:31:11.200 --> 00:31:13.200
 --to control the kind of repetition of language.

00:31:13.200 --> 00:31:18.200
 There was a scientific paper with no words in it that I found.

00:31:18.200 --> 00:31:31.200
 It was by a guy, a clinical psychologist called Dennis Opper, which he wrote or didn't write in 1974, and it was called the unsuccessful self-treatment of a case of writer's block.

00:31:31.200 --> 00:31:36.200
 Wow. That's the right form. That's the scientific equivalent of John Cage's four minutes 30 years.

00:31:36.200 --> 00:31:37.200
 Yeah, exactly that.

00:31:37.200 --> 00:31:38.200
 Nice. That's great.

00:31:38.200 --> 00:31:46.200
 You can instead of like for 4.33, but you told about this the other day, you told about 4.33 and how it's about the audience noise and the orchestra noise or the pianist noise.

00:31:46.200 --> 00:31:54.200
 Is that just reading that paper? You just, as a scientist, have the internal thoughts of disappointment.

00:31:54.200 --> 00:31:56.200
 Yeah, you project onto it. You project your--

00:31:56.200 --> 00:32:00.200
 That's really cool.

00:32:00.200 --> 00:32:08.200
 I went on to Google News and looked for the word astounding to see what people are describing as astounding at the moment.

00:32:08.200 --> 00:32:17.200
 It's astounding that 10 households in Western Supermass still watch Black and White Telly, according to one of the most recent headline I've found.

00:32:17.200 --> 00:32:18.200
 See, there we are. I'm not astounded.

00:32:18.200 --> 00:32:19.200
 I know.

00:32:19.200 --> 00:32:21.200
 I'm intrigued.

00:32:21.200 --> 00:32:24.200
 I thought that word was going to be indifferent.

00:32:24.200 --> 00:32:32.200
 I mean, those must be your erity now, and I'm sure the sets have a certain value to a collector or a connoisseur.

00:32:32.200 --> 00:32:35.200
 And you pay a cheaper license fee?

00:32:35.200 --> 00:32:36.200
 Yes, you do.

00:32:36.200 --> 00:32:37.200
 Right, yeah.

00:32:37.200 --> 00:32:44.200
 The next astounding new story I found was officer hands out an astounding 19,000 parking tickets in a year.

00:32:44.200 --> 00:32:46.200
 No, that is astounding.

00:32:46.200 --> 00:32:52.200
 I'm surprised that you wouldn't say, "Well, you would expect that. He's a parking bit."

00:32:52.200 --> 00:32:59.200
 And then the third one that I found was, "It's astounding. Seven Black and White TV licenses are currently in force in Pontiprid."

00:32:59.200 --> 00:33:00.200
 Wow.

00:33:00.200 --> 00:33:06.200
 So it's the word astounding outside science papers is mostly used to describe TV like this.

00:33:06.200 --> 00:33:07.200
 No, that is astounding.

00:33:07.200 --> 00:33:09.200
 It is.

00:33:09.200 --> 00:33:14.200
 Okay, that's it.

00:33:14.200 --> 00:33:15.200
 That's all of our facts.

00:33:15.200 --> 00:33:16.200

 The last Tuesday of every month.

00:33:42.200 --> 00:33:43.200
 We are.

00:33:43.200 --> 00:33:46.200
 It's called an evening of unnecessary detail.

00:33:46.200 --> 00:33:48.200
 And it does exactly what it says on the tin.

00:33:48.200 --> 00:33:53.200
 Even your own Andre Hunter Murray is doing our Cassio Knight special.

00:33:53.200 --> 00:33:54.200
 It will be astounding.

00:33:54.200 --> 00:33:55.200
 It will be astounding.

00:33:55.200 --> 00:33:56.200
 It will be astounding.

00:33:56.200 --> 00:33:57.200
