00:00:00,00:00:02,"- Oh, yeah."
00:00:02,00:00:04,- [speaking in foreign language]
00:00:04,00:00:07,[theme music]
00:00:07,00:00:09,- [speaking in foreign language]
00:00:09,00:00:13,[theme music]
00:00:13,00:00:16,"- Hello and welcome to No Such Things A Fish,"
00:00:16,00:00:18,a weekly podcast coming to you from the queue.
00:00:18,00:00:20,I offer this in Covent Garden.
00:00:20,00:00:23,"My name is Anna and I am here with Andrew Hunter Murray,"
00:00:23,00:00:26,James Harkin and Anne Miller.
00:00:26,00:00:28,"Once again, we've gathered around the microphones"
00:00:28,00:00:31,with our four favorite maps that we found in the last seven days
00:00:31,00:00:33,and in no particular order.
00:00:33,00:00:36,"Here we go, starting with you, James."
00:00:36,00:00:38,- My fact this week is that Anna wants to be like
00:00:38,00:00:41,with Donna and known by just one name.
00:00:41,00:00:43,[laughing]
00:00:43,00:00:44,- What is that all about?
00:00:44,00:00:47,"- Did I, I couldn't work out if normally we do two names"
00:00:47,00:00:48,or one side mix it up?
00:00:48,00:00:50,- I thought it was casual and friendly.
00:00:50,00:00:51,"Like, don't enough podcast now."
00:00:51,00:00:52,- I thought it was power mad.
00:00:52,00:00:54,[laughing]
00:00:54,00:00:56,- I thought it was maybe that you could work out
00:00:56,00:00:57,to pronounce your old surname.
00:00:57,00:00:59,[laughing]
00:00:59,00:01:02,- It might have been that dance confused me over the years.
00:01:02,00:01:03,- I'd like to be known as Lightning from now
00:01:03,00:01:05,"and I'm this podcast, please."
00:01:05,00:01:05,"- All right, that's fine."
00:01:05,00:01:06,- You've already got three calls.
00:01:06,00:01:08,- So I'll introduce you all again.
00:01:08,00:01:12,"My name is Anna and I'm joined by Lightning, James and Anne."
00:01:12,00:01:13,[laughing]
00:01:13,00:01:14,- I'm followed.
00:01:14,00:01:18,"- Okay, my fact this week is that in 1758,"
00:01:18,00:01:20,"there were two camels on display in London,"
00:01:20,00:01:23,one with a single hump and one with two humps.
00:01:23,00:01:26,They were advertised as the surprising camel
00:01:26,00:01:27,and the wonderful camel.
00:01:27,00:01:29,[laughing]
00:01:29,00:01:31,"- Yeah, which was it?"
00:01:31,00:01:35,- I think the one with a single hump was surprising
00:01:35,00:01:37,and the one with two humps was wonderful.
00:01:37,00:01:39,- I think they're all surprising to start off with.
00:01:39,00:01:39,"- Yeah, I agree."
00:01:39,00:01:42,- And then a difference in humps is also surprising.
00:01:42,00:01:43,So I think they're both surprising.
00:01:43,00:01:44,- Are they?
00:01:44,00:01:45,- I think it was wonderful.
00:01:45,00:01:46,- Yeah. - Let's not do camels down there.
00:01:46,00:01:47,- I agree with Lightning.
00:01:47,00:01:49,[laughing]
00:01:49,00:01:52,I read this in the London Review of Books
00:01:52,00:01:55,"and it was a review of a book called ""Managerie"""
00:01:55,00:01:57,by Caroline Griggsson.
00:01:57,00:01:59,"I haven't read that book yet, but I am going to read it"
00:01:59,00:02:00,'cause it looks amazing.
00:02:00,00:02:02,There's some really good facts in that review.
00:02:02,00:02:04,- I read a really good book about the history of London
00:02:04,00:02:05,and zoo a couple of years ago.
00:02:05,00:02:07,My favorite thing in the whole book was that London zoo
00:02:07,00:02:08,used to be at the Tower of London
00:02:08,00:02:10,"and when it was there, you could get in for free"
00:02:10,00:02:13,if you brought a dog or a cat to feed to the lions.
00:02:13,00:02:14,- Nice.
00:02:14,00:02:16,Was it entry for one or was it for a family?
00:02:16,00:02:17,Or did you have to bring kittens
00:02:17,00:02:19,if you wanted your children to go and see the lions?
00:02:19,00:02:20,"- I think if you were bringing a family,"
00:02:20,00:02:21,you had to bring a surprising camel.
00:02:21,00:02:23,[laughing]
00:02:23,00:02:26,"- So one other thing that I saw 'cause yeah,"
00:02:26,00:02:27,"that book does look incredible, doesn't it?"
00:02:27,00:02:29,And one other thing that I really like that she spotted
00:02:29,00:02:33,is that this was in the age where it was very fashionable
00:02:33,00:02:34,if you're a wealthy person to bring
00:02:34,00:02:36,back lots of exotic animals from various places
00:02:36,00:02:38,or descend agents off to get them
00:02:38,00:02:40,and apparently one London merchant asked his agent
00:02:40,00:02:43,"to send him two or three apes,"
00:02:43,00:02:46,"but he forgot the ""R"" on ""Or"""
00:02:46,00:02:49,and so he was delivered 203 apes.
00:02:49,00:02:50,[laughing]
00:02:50,00:02:51,- Where did he put them?
00:02:51,00:02:52,- I don't know.
00:02:52,00:02:53,- I don't know.
00:02:53,00:02:55,"Apparently the first cargo of ""80 apes"" arrived"
00:02:55,00:02:57,when the legs are promising them more.
00:02:57,00:02:58,[laughing]
00:02:58,00:02:59,- There was one other thing in there
00:02:59,00:03:03,that George the Fourth had a giraffe at Windsor
00:03:03,00:03:05,and the giraffe didn't flourish very well
00:03:05,00:03:06,because it was in Windsor
00:03:06,00:03:09,and not where it's supposed to live in Africa.
00:03:09,00:03:10,- Which is a Sandriggum.
00:03:10,00:03:12,[laughing]
00:03:12,00:03:15,"- And when it got sick, they put it down to sympathy"
00:03:15,00:03:19,for the King's gout and load of peon nonsense.
00:03:19,00:03:22,"- sympathy for the gout, that's outrageous."
00:03:22,00:03:25,"- You can say that or in an alternative fact universe,"
00:03:25,00:03:27,you can say that maybe it was feeling sad
00:03:27,00:03:28,'cause the King was sad.
00:03:28,00:03:29,- Maybe it was sad.
00:03:29,00:03:31,- Do you know they have camel wrestling festivals
00:03:31,00:03:32,in Turkey?
00:03:32,00:03:34,- Is that camel's wrestling against each other?
00:03:34,00:03:36,- It is camel's wrestling against each other.
00:03:36,00:03:37,Yeah.
00:03:37,00:03:37,- But how does a camel wrestle?
00:03:37,00:03:39,"- Yeah, they're on all fours."
00:03:39,00:03:40,"- Well, with great difficulty."
00:03:40,00:03:41,- Yeah.
00:03:41,00:03:43,- It's the odd joke.
00:03:43,00:03:45,"They, I don't know if they do it with camels,"
00:03:45,00:03:46,but often they do it by showing
00:03:46,00:03:50,"the two competence, a sexy lady insert animal here."
00:03:50,00:03:52,So they might bring on a sexy lady camel
00:03:52,00:03:54,and then remove it and then the two blokes remaining
00:03:54,00:03:56,"say, ""Well, I want it, well, I want it."""
00:03:56,00:03:58,And little did they know they're not gonna get it.
00:03:58,00:03:59,- Do you know what constitutes a beautiful camel
00:03:59,00:04:01,since you mentioned a sexy lady?
00:04:01,00:04:02,- Long eyelashes.
00:04:02,00:04:03,"- Yeah, of course, the eyelashes."
00:04:03,00:04:05,"- They do, have lots of wine lashes."
00:04:05,00:04:06,Although maybe in the camel world
00:04:06,00:04:07,"'cause that's so common then short eyelashes,"
00:04:07,00:04:08,lovely lady humps.
00:04:08,00:04:12,[laughing]
00:04:12,00:04:13,So I've been reading about Omar lately
00:04:13,00:04:15,'cause we're researching for the O series
00:04:15,00:04:18,when they have camel beauty contests in Oman.
00:04:18,00:04:19,And they're put on by the government
00:04:19,00:04:22,and it's a milking and beauty contest.
00:04:22,00:04:24,And a beautiful camel apparently should have
00:04:24,00:04:27,"a well-proportioned body and face,"
00:04:27,00:04:31,"a long garib, which is the area between the hump and the neck,"
00:04:31,00:04:33,a clear and huge hump.
00:04:33,00:04:34,[laughing]
00:04:34,00:04:35,It needs to have...
00:04:35,00:04:36,"- This was written by men, wasn't it?"
00:04:36,00:04:39,[laughing]
00:04:39,00:04:43,"- Firm ears and pouty lips, big whiskers,"
00:04:43,00:04:45,and a fur shimmer.
00:04:45,00:04:45,- Right.
00:04:45,00:04:48,"- Yeah, and he's good posture and it needs to be huge."
00:04:48,00:04:50,[laughing]
00:04:50,00:04:52,"- That kind of makes sense, all that stuff."
00:04:52,00:04:53,"- That does sounds quite attractive, isn't it?"
00:04:53,00:04:55,- Is it of both sexes?
00:04:55,00:04:57,"As in, the male camel's compete against female camels"
00:04:57,00:04:59,that just has to be a beautiful camel.
00:04:59,00:05:00,- Yes.
00:05:00,00:05:00,- Really?
00:05:00,00:05:01,- Yeah.
00:05:01,00:05:03,I don't think you can tell a male a female camel apart
00:05:03,00:05:04,by looking at it.
00:05:04,00:05:05,- I bet you can.
00:05:05,00:05:06,[laughing]
00:05:06,00:05:07,- Where you're looking.
00:05:07,00:05:09,[laughing]
00:05:09,00:05:11,"- In the 18th century, there was a collection"
00:05:11,00:05:13,"of camels on display on the strand,"
00:05:13,00:05:14,just around the corner from us.
00:05:14,00:05:16,"So it was at the toll but in in the strand,"
00:05:16,00:05:18,and it belonged to a man called Richard Hepenstool.
00:05:18,00:05:20,And so that's exactly where
00:05:20,00:05:21,"all the tube station used to be,"
00:05:21,00:05:23,"which I think is just a little bit, isn't it?"
00:05:23,00:05:26,"He tried to lure women in to view his herd of camels,"
00:05:26,00:05:28,because at the time women were afraid
00:05:28,00:05:31,there would be a bit dirty and a bit spitty and a bit smelly.
00:05:31,00:05:35,"So he advertised them as having breath as sweet as a salz,"
00:05:35,00:05:37,"which is weird, 'cause I didn't think a salz"
00:05:37,00:05:39,is having particularly sweet breath.
00:05:39,00:05:40,"But apparently, soon afterwards,"
00:05:40,00:05:42,there was a journal article or a newspaper article
00:05:42,00:05:45,that reported that the ladies are especially charmed
00:05:45,00:05:47,by the camels and express great satisfaction
00:05:47,00:05:49,at the sweetness of their breath.
00:05:49,00:05:51,"- See, that's quite high-risk, because I read"
00:05:51,00:05:52,"that when a camel spits at you,"
00:05:52,00:05:54,"it's also kind of bombing at you,"
00:05:54,00:05:56,'cause the content of their stomach comes up as well.
00:05:56,00:05:57,"- Yeah, it's not a spits, is it?"
00:05:57,00:05:58,"- Yeah, really?"
00:05:58,00:05:59,"Oh, it's just spitting, no."
00:05:59,00:06:01,"Maybe that's what generated such sweet breath, though."
00:06:01,00:06:02,[laughing]
00:06:02,00:06:04,- Do you know what you could get from a camel?
00:06:04,00:06:05,"- What? - If it spat at you,"
00:06:05,00:06:08,a cold because one of the four common cold viruses
00:06:08,00:06:10,originated in camels.
00:06:10,00:06:11,- No.
00:06:11,00:06:12,- Really?
00:06:12,00:06:13,- And spread to humans.
00:06:13,00:06:14,- This is according to the German Center
00:06:14,00:06:15,for Infection Research.
00:06:15,00:06:19,"Yeah, and there are four global human,"
00:06:19,00:06:20,"they're called coronaviruses,"
00:06:20,00:06:22,"and there are also things called rhinoviruses,"
00:06:22,00:06:23,rhino-meaning nose.
00:06:23,00:06:24,- They come from rhinos.
00:06:24,00:06:26,- Yep.
00:06:26,00:06:28,[laughing]
00:06:28,00:06:29,"And so one of these, one of these main ones,"
00:06:29,00:06:31,"apparently, has made its way over from camels."
00:06:31,00:06:33,"At a long time ago, I don't know if you could still"
00:06:33,00:06:35,"get the same virus inhabiting both,"
00:06:35,00:06:37,"or whether it's come over, and now it's only humans."
00:06:37,00:06:39,Not sure. - Wow.
00:06:39,00:06:39,"- Yeah, still."
00:06:39,00:06:40,- I didn't know that.
00:06:40,00:06:43,"Firstly, camel can drink as many as 30 gallons of water"
00:06:43,00:06:46,in 13 minutes.
00:06:46,00:06:46,Okay.
00:06:46,00:06:48,"Which sounds impressive, but I worked that out,"
00:06:48,00:06:51,"and that's 3.25 seconds per pint,"
00:06:51,00:06:54,and I can drink a pint in less than three seconds.
00:06:54,00:06:54,- Right.
00:06:54,00:06:56,- So I can drink faster than a camel.
00:06:56,00:06:58,"- It's shortened long fur longs, though, isn't it?"
00:06:58,00:07:00,[laughing]
00:07:00,00:07:02,"- Well, I would be ahead after the first pint,"
00:07:02,00:07:04,"but then by probably halfway through pint two,"
00:07:04,00:07:05,it might overtake me.
00:07:05,00:07:07,[laughing]
00:07:07,00:07:11,"And then by pint 240, be struggling a little bit."
00:07:11,00:07:13,- So you just have to pick your race
00:07:13,00:07:15,when you're challenging the camel to the drinking contest.
00:07:15,00:07:16,- Yeah.
00:07:16,00:07:18,"- So when you say to the camel, I want a drinking contest,"
00:07:18,00:07:21,"and he says, okay, let's do 240 pints, you know."
00:07:21,00:07:23,"Well, let's start a one and see how we do that."
00:07:23,00:07:27,And don't do double our quits on the next 239.
00:07:27,00:07:29,[laughing]
00:07:29,00:07:31,- I didn't realize that there are three kinds of camel.
00:07:31,00:07:33,"I thought dromedary and backtrune were the only kinds,"
00:07:33,00:07:34,but the wild backtrune's probably
00:07:34,00:07:36,where I'd have different chromosomes.
00:07:36,00:07:37,- It's got three humps.
00:07:37,00:07:38,[laughing]
00:07:38,00:07:40,"- Yeah, they did a DNA sequencing on it,"
00:07:40,00:07:41,and it's different species.
00:07:41,00:07:43,"- Well, so we've mentioned before"
00:07:43,00:07:46,"the Saudi Arabia imports camels from Australia,"
00:07:46,00:07:48,"because for me, but actually now,"
00:07:48,00:07:49,have you heard that they're trying to rescue camels
00:07:49,00:07:50,from Australia?
00:07:50,00:07:53,"So Australia's got too many camels,"
00:07:53,00:07:54,"apparently they're becoming a bit of a pest,"
00:07:54,00:07:56,and they were threatening to coal.
00:07:56,00:07:59,"I think 6,000 camels a few years ago,"
00:07:59,00:08:00,and there was a big campaign set up
00:08:00,00:08:02,"in Saudi Arabia and internet campaigns,"
00:08:02,00:08:04,"saying send the camels to us instead,"
00:08:04,00:08:05,and we'll look after them.
00:08:05,00:08:07,"- Yeah, but Australia has a million feral camels,"
00:08:07,00:08:10,"so 6,000 is pretty small beer, actually."
00:08:10,00:08:12,"I think we've said before, they shoot them from helicopters."
00:08:12,00:08:13,"- Yeah, they do, apparently one."
00:08:13,00:08:15,I think this was in the Australian.
00:08:15,00:08:16,"Apparently camels in Australia,"
00:08:16,00:08:18,"smash water tanks destroy fences,"
00:08:18,00:08:21,come up to houses and antagonize people.
00:08:21,00:08:22,[laughing]
00:08:22,00:08:23,I don't know how a camel antagonist is.
00:08:23,00:08:25,- That's just trying to blend in.
00:08:25,00:08:26,[laughing]
00:08:26,00:08:29,[upbeat music]
00:08:29,00:08:33,"- Okay, onto fact number two,"
00:08:33,00:08:36,and that is Andy's back.
00:08:36,00:08:38,"- Lightning's factor, then you'll find."
00:08:38,00:08:39,[laughing]
00:08:39,00:08:41,"Okay, my fact is that before they are launched,"
00:08:41,00:08:45,London sends all its trains to Austria to be beaten up.
00:08:45,00:08:46,[laughing]
00:08:46,00:08:48,"So there's this wind tunnel,"
00:08:48,00:08:49,which is called the Rail-Tech Arsenal.
00:08:49,00:08:52,"There's a huge article on wire about them recently,"
00:08:52,00:08:54,"and the article describes them as train torture chambers,"
00:08:54,00:08:58,"so you can put a whole 330 foot long train in this tunnel,"
00:08:58,00:09:00,and then they basically simulate extreme weather conditions
00:09:00,00:09:02,"and see how the carriages stand up to it,"
00:09:02,00:09:05,"so you can see what it'll be like for passengers,"
00:09:05,00:09:07,"if the train gets stuck in boiling sun,"
00:09:07,00:09:09,"or snow, or what a huge wind conditions are."
00:09:09,00:09:11,"- That must be very confusing for the train,"
00:09:11,00:09:13,"because normally when he goes in the tunnel,"
00:09:13,00:09:14,there's no weather.
00:09:14,00:09:16,[laughing]
00:09:16,00:09:19,- It's like a Thomas getting fucked up.
00:09:19,00:09:20,[laughing]
00:09:20,00:09:20,About a CIA.
00:09:20,00:09:21,[laughing]
00:09:21,00:09:23,- Are we in danger of anthropomorphizing trains
00:09:23,00:09:24,"a little bit, yeah?"
00:09:24,00:09:25,"- Well, they shouldn't draw those faces on the front,"
00:09:25,00:09:26,are they?
00:09:26,00:09:27,[laughing]
00:09:27,00:09:28,Yeah.
00:09:28,00:09:30,- They do simulate conditions that they wouldn't necessarily
00:09:30,00:09:31,"come across in this country, don't they?"
00:09:31,00:09:34,Don't they go down to a ridiculously low and high temperatures?
00:09:34,00:09:38,"- Well, the London ones, they only test to minus 13 Celsius,"
00:09:38,00:09:40,"which is very, would be very low for London,"
00:09:40,00:09:44,but they can set it to minus 50 Fahrenheit.
00:09:44,00:09:45,What would that be?
00:09:45,00:09:47,"It's, that's cold."
00:09:47,00:09:48,- That's really cold.
00:09:48,00:09:49,[laughing]
00:09:49,00:09:52,"So trains from Kazakhstan get sent there as well,"
00:09:52,00:09:53,"and they'll have lower temperatures, probably."
00:09:53,00:09:55,- Is everyone's trains go to this tunnel?
00:09:55,00:09:58,"- Loads of Germany, America, Kazakhstan, Saudi Arabia,"
00:09:58,00:10:01,"they all, the article described as the Eaton College"
00:10:01,00:10:03,of the train testing world.
00:10:03,00:10:05,"- Well, you got beaten up already, I guess."
00:10:05,00:10:07,- You shoved the train in a toilet for a minute.
00:10:07,00:10:08,[laughing]
00:10:08,00:10:10,"- You think if all the trains had to go through this tunnel,"
00:10:10,00:10:13,wouldn't it make sense for all the train factories to be in Vienna?
00:10:13,00:10:15,"- Yeah, I guess it would, but we've got,"
00:10:15,00:10:18,I guess once you've built a train factory in Derby.
00:10:18,00:10:19,"- And how do you reckon they go,"
00:10:19,00:10:22,are they allowed to go on the train tracks to get to the tunnel?
00:10:22,00:10:25,Or do they have to go on a lorry because they're not pass safety?
00:10:25,00:10:26,"- Yeah, I think they get voted over."
00:10:26,00:10:28,"- They do, they get seven of them."
00:10:28,00:10:28,- Train some votes.
00:10:28,00:10:29,- Yeah.
00:10:29,00:10:32,"- You get trains which you can put cars on, don't you?"
00:10:32,00:10:34,"I think we have one or two of those in Britain,"
00:10:34,00:10:35,but you get them especially abroad.
00:10:35,00:10:37,- You put cars in the Urester.
00:10:37,00:10:41,"- I would just love to have a car on a train, on a boat."
00:10:41,00:10:42,[laughing]
00:10:42,00:10:45,- I'd probably put like a bike rack on there as well.
00:10:45,00:10:47,[laughing]
00:10:47,00:10:49,"- Oh, also they've got, I think it was in the news this week"
00:10:49,00:10:51,or last week we've finally got a direct train service
00:10:51,00:10:53,from Britain to China.
00:10:53,00:10:54,I don't know why I say finally like we've all been
00:10:54,00:10:55,just pretty wasteful.
00:10:55,00:10:57,"- We've all been stunned on the platform,"
00:10:57,00:10:58,but I've been here already a minute.
00:10:58,00:10:59,- Southern.
00:10:59,00:11:02,[laughing]
00:11:02,00:11:03,"- But you know, I think that's amazing."
00:11:03,00:11:05,"It takes 18 days, it's a freight train,"
00:11:05,00:11:06,so you have to be a piece of freight.
00:11:06,00:11:07,[laughing]
00:11:07,00:11:09,"- You're a piece of freight, right?"
00:11:09,00:11:10,[laughing]
00:11:10,00:11:13,"- But it goes to Yuwu, which is in East China,"
00:11:13,00:11:15,and that's the place that provides 60%
00:11:15,00:11:16,of the world's Christmas decorations.
00:11:16,00:11:19,And so I think it's like the new Santa's sleigh
00:11:19,00:11:22,"and it goes direct from China to London,"
00:11:22,00:11:24,but that has to actually be lifted from one track
00:11:24,00:11:25,to the other sometimes 'cause different countries
00:11:25,00:11:27,have different gauges. - Wow.
00:11:27,00:11:28,"- Just on train testing,"
00:11:28,00:11:31,do you know what the new measurement train is?
00:11:31,00:11:32,- No. - No?
00:11:32,00:11:34,- This is this train that's constantly in operation
00:11:34,00:11:36,"around the country, and it's to test all the tracks"
00:11:36,00:11:38,"and it runs 125 miles an hour,"
00:11:38,00:11:39,"and it has various means of testing the track,"
00:11:39,00:11:41,so there are no passengers on it.
00:11:41,00:11:44,"It was made in response to Hatfield,"
00:11:44,00:11:45,"so that was the year 2000, wasn't it?"
00:11:45,00:11:48,"And, but it's got this amazing technology,"
00:11:48,00:11:50,so it can test tracks as people would have to
00:11:50,00:11:53,"at a walking pace, but at 125 miles an hour,"
00:11:53,00:11:55,"by for instance firing lasers at them,"
00:11:55,00:11:57,"and it measures contact with the rails,"
00:11:57,00:11:59,"and it measures the electrical supply,"
00:11:59,00:12:01,"and you know in some places you need to have a tilt on trains,"
00:12:01,00:12:04,"it checks that the tilt isn't too much,"
00:12:04,00:12:06,so it won't crash into a cliff next to it or something.
00:12:06,00:12:08,And these are going running around the country at all times.
00:12:08,00:12:10,- So there are 100 mile an hour trains
00:12:10,00:12:12,going around the country firing lasers at things?
00:12:12,00:12:14,- Correct. - It's so cool.
00:12:14,00:12:15,"- They're really cool, yeah."
00:12:15,00:12:19,- Have you heard about Operation Smash hit?
00:12:19,00:12:21,- Is it about 1970s pop stars?
00:12:21,00:12:23,(laughing)
00:12:23,00:12:24,It's very well-known.
00:12:25,00:12:27,(laughing)
00:12:27,00:12:30,"No, it was an experiment that in 1984 in July,"
00:12:30,00:12:32,"by the British Central Electricity Generating Board,"
00:12:32,00:12:35,"and what they did was they got a train,"
00:12:35,00:12:37,and they set it to smash at 100 miles an hour
00:12:37,00:12:39,into a flask of nuclear waste.
00:12:39,00:12:40,- What?
00:12:40,00:12:41,- A flask.
00:12:41,00:12:43,- And they televised this flask of nuclear waste.
00:12:43,00:12:47,"- Yeah, so they had these new ways of storing nuclear material,"
00:12:47,00:12:48,"as it does material in these flasks, right?"
00:12:48,00:12:51,And very strongly built flasks.
00:12:51,00:12:52,"And they set one of these up on a track,"
00:12:52,00:12:54,and they sort of wedged it into concrete.
00:12:54,00:12:55,"And this is an orbit of testing track,"
00:12:55,00:12:56,and they didn't need to use any more.
00:12:56,00:12:58,"And they got an old train, they didn't need."
00:12:58,00:13:01,And they set it going at it at 100 miles an hour.
00:13:01,00:13:02,And then they put it on TV.
00:13:02,00:13:04,"Millions of people watched it all around the world,"
00:13:04,00:13:06,"and it was to show how safe these nuclear flasks were,"
00:13:06,00:13:08,'cause it didn't break.
00:13:08,00:13:10,- Oh wow. - They barely lost any of its pressure at all.
00:13:10,00:13:14,"It was, and this was the final of a series of experiments"
00:13:14,00:13:16,"they did where they like engulfed them in flames,"
00:13:16,00:13:18,"these flask, and they dropped them from a big height."
00:13:18,00:13:18,- Amazing.
00:13:18,00:13:20,- And they did like all these loony tunes experiments
00:13:20,00:13:22,just to show you cannot break into these.
00:13:22,00:13:23,It was to reassure the public.
00:13:23,00:13:26,"- And it's high risk though, 'cause one of those goes wrong."
00:13:26,00:13:27,Sorry we just wiped out the country.
00:13:27,00:13:31,- So France has had problems with trains lately.
00:13:31,00:13:33,And I think it's important that we smash the myth
00:13:33,00:13:34,that France is the train king of Europe
00:13:34,00:13:38,"because in 2014, it's the train king of Europe."
00:13:38,00:13:40,"- Yeah, come on then."
00:13:40,00:13:43,"So who is the king of trains, the train king of Europe?"
00:13:43,00:13:45,"- Well, I think we should enter ourselves"
00:13:45,00:13:47,"into the contest, 'cause France is out, right?"
00:13:47,00:13:50,"In 2014, I think we've mentioned before,"
00:13:50,00:13:51,they made those trains that are too wide
00:13:51,00:13:53,"for their stations, do you remember?"
00:13:53,00:13:55,"- So they built, they spent billions."
00:13:55,00:13:57,- That's pretty embarrassing for the train king
00:13:57,00:13:58,of Europe to do that.
00:13:58,00:13:59,(laughing)
00:13:59,00:14:02,"- So this was, they'd spent 15 billion euros"
00:14:02,00:14:03,"on these trains, they were too wide."
00:14:03,00:14:06,So they had to amend thousands of platforms across France
00:14:06,00:14:07,so they fitted them.
00:14:07,00:14:09,"And then the following year, they made trains"
00:14:09,00:14:12,that are too tall to get through tunnels
00:14:12,00:14:13,to take them into Italy.
00:14:13,00:14:16,"- Wow, so who's gonna be your new train king of Europe, Hannah?"
00:14:16,00:14:18,"- Well, like I say, I think we're in with the shot, guys."
00:14:18,00:14:19,"- I would've thought Switzerland,"
00:14:19,00:14:20,but I was on a train in Switzerland last week
00:14:20,00:14:23,and it got cancelled and I had to walk across
00:14:23,00:14:24,to another platform.
00:14:24,00:14:26,"- You wouldn't think that in Switzerland, would you?"
00:14:26,00:14:27,"- No, you wouldn't."
00:14:27,00:14:30,"- For me, they were always the train prince of Europe."
00:14:30,00:14:31,(laughing)
00:14:31,00:14:33,"- I have a nomination, I nominate Sweden"
00:14:33,00:14:35,because I went Stockholm a few years ago
00:14:35,00:14:38,and the train there was so amazing.
00:14:38,00:14:40,"It was really lovely, it felt like first class,"
00:14:40,00:14:42,"it was a standard class and I had a sign up saying,"
00:14:42,00:14:43,"""If you're more than two minutes late,"
00:14:43,00:14:44,"""will we fund you in full?"""
00:14:44,00:14:46,"- Two minutes, yeah."
00:14:46,00:14:46,- Wow.
00:14:46,00:14:47,"- It wasn't the airport express train,"
00:14:47,00:14:49,but I was a pretty good deal.
00:14:49,00:14:51,So I nominate Sweden for a train king.
00:14:51,00:14:52,- Okay.
00:14:52,00:14:53,"Look, these nominations have all been accepted"
00:14:53,00:14:54,and we'll be duty-consuming.
00:14:54,00:14:56,- I'm a train Republican.
00:14:56,00:14:57,(laughing)
00:14:57,00:14:59,I think we should put all the trains in a shed.
00:14:59,00:15:01,(laughing)
00:15:01,00:15:02,- We should move on quite soon.
00:15:02,00:15:03,Has anyone got anything else?
00:15:03,00:15:06,"- So in Vienna, also in Austria,"
00:15:06,00:15:10,they had an escalator reopening in 2015
00:15:10,00:15:13,"and 14,000 people signed up to turn up"
00:15:13,00:15:16,to this reopening of an escalator.
00:15:16,00:15:19,"In the end, a good few hundred people turned up"
00:15:19,00:15:21,and the party just got out of hand
00:15:21,00:15:24,and police had to be called to calm the crowd down.
00:15:24,00:15:25,"- Did someone have to say,"
00:15:25,00:15:27,"""Well, that escalated quickly."""
00:15:27,00:15:30,(upbeat music)
00:15:30,00:15:36,"- Okay, moving on to fact number three and that is--"
00:15:36,00:15:37,- And facts.
00:15:37,00:15:41,- My fact is that the oil company shell used to sell shells.
00:15:41,00:15:42,(laughing)
00:15:42,00:15:44,- And it's not a coincidence
00:15:44,00:15:46,that you know when they're selling the shells
00:15:46,00:15:47,or the two things related.
00:15:47,00:15:48,- They were different generations.
00:15:48,00:15:51,So Marcus Samuel in 1833 started
00:15:51,00:15:54,had an antiques business and started selling seashells
00:15:54,00:15:56,and then they got very popular.
00:15:56,00:15:57,So they started having these trading rates
00:15:57,00:15:59,for import export all over the world
00:15:59,00:16:02,and then his son Marcus Samuel Jr.
00:16:02,00:16:03,"expanded the business, different goods"
00:16:03,00:16:05,and then ended up doing oil.
00:16:05,00:16:07,"- Oil is more lucrative than shell selling, isn't it?"
00:16:07,00:16:09,I guess they clapped onto that.
00:16:09,00:16:11,- A bit riskier though.
00:16:11,00:16:13,- Yes. - For the world?
00:16:13,00:16:14,"- Yeah, I think so."
00:16:14,00:16:17,- But also you can't power a massive industrial economy
00:16:17,00:16:18,just grinding up seashells.
00:16:18,00:16:19,(laughing)
00:16:19,00:16:20,So I'm glad.
00:16:20,00:16:23,- Actually seashells used to be used as currency.
00:16:23,00:16:25,"Many, many years ago."
00:16:25,00:16:27,"- What, not in Britain?"
00:16:27,00:16:29,"- No, before Britain existed."
00:16:29,00:16:31,Like I'm talking about thousands of years ago.
00:16:31,00:16:33,I think they were cowrie shells.
00:16:33,00:16:34,I'm going off memory a bit here
00:16:34,00:16:38,and they were used around Africa I think as currency
00:16:38,00:16:40,but then they found a new bay
00:16:40,00:16:42,which had tons and tons and tons of cowrie shells in
00:16:42,00:16:44,and then people just went and collected loads and loads
00:16:44,00:16:46,of them and ended up completely collapsing
00:16:46,00:16:48,the very early economy.
00:16:48,00:16:50,- Did you know that shell is revisiting
00:16:50,00:16:52,at shell based routes?
00:16:52,00:16:52,- Really?
00:16:52,00:16:57,- In that they are helping to return shells
00:16:57,00:16:58,to their natural environment.
00:16:58,00:17:01,So they're sponsoring this nonprofit organization
00:17:01,00:17:04,which collects shells from restaurants
00:17:04,00:17:06,and then puts them back on beaches and in areas
00:17:06,00:17:07,where oysters can cling onto them
00:17:07,00:17:08,'cause apparently oysters like to cling
00:17:08,00:17:10,onto other oyster shells.
00:17:10,00:17:11,So there you go.
00:17:11,00:17:13,They're collecting shells again.
00:17:13,00:17:14,- So I was really impressed with this fact
00:17:14,00:17:15,and I thought it was brilliant.
00:17:15,00:17:17,My husband already knew it
00:17:17,00:17:22,because there is a cart file song from the 30s about shell.
00:17:22,00:17:22,Did you notice?
00:17:22,00:17:24,- And it's married to a 101 year old man.
00:17:24,00:17:26,(laughing)
00:17:26,00:17:28,"The whole song is about, in Margate,"
00:17:28,00:17:30,there was a promenade and a man was selling shells
00:17:30,00:17:32,and his song comes along and turns the business around
00:17:32,00:17:34,and ends up being this big thing
00:17:34,00:17:36,about how it's a complex come out of oil
00:17:36,00:17:38,in the United League of Nations.
00:17:38,00:17:39,- From the 1930s.
00:17:39,00:17:40,- Wow. - That's kind of cool.
00:17:40,00:17:42,- He used to write songs about very different things
00:17:42,00:17:43,in the '30s.
00:17:43,00:17:44,(laughing)
00:17:44,00:17:49,- The first ever oil company was founded to harvest
00:17:49,00:17:51,just oil that was floating on water.
00:17:51,00:17:53,"'Cause that was the first people knew about,"
00:17:53,00:17:55,obviously you don't know oil in the ground.
00:17:55,00:17:56,- You said it. - Yeah.
00:17:56,00:17:57,"- Yeah, so they sort of saw it."
00:17:57,00:17:59,It was in Pennsylvania in 1859
00:17:59,00:18:02,"and they said, oh, maybe there's more oil underneath here"
00:18:02,00:18:04,and they started drilling down and they struck oil.
00:18:04,00:18:08,But I think that was the first time that oil was actually struck.
00:18:08,00:18:10,- You know that just speaking of oil floating
00:18:10,00:18:14,"on water, so bitumen is like, it's more solid oil."
00:18:14,00:18:17,"It's made of the same stuff, but it's like more compressed."
00:18:17,00:18:20,And so I think the first ever oil kingdom
00:18:20,00:18:22,that made its money from oil was the Nabatians
00:18:22,00:18:23,who I love.
00:18:23,00:18:25,I'm never researching them for the end series.
00:18:25,00:18:26,So in the four days.
00:18:26,00:18:29,- You were always trying to shoe on the Nabatians.
00:18:29,00:18:31,"In fact, Anna was actually sure for Ann Nabatians."
00:18:31,00:18:34,(laughing)
00:18:34,00:18:35,- I'm even older than Ann Sonsland.
00:18:35,00:18:37,(laughing)
00:18:37,00:18:39,"- No, this is incredible."
00:18:39,00:18:41,They made their money 'cause they were near the Dead Sea
00:18:41,00:18:43,that so they base their kingdom around the Dead Sea.
00:18:43,00:18:45,And they noticed these lumps of bitumen floating
00:18:45,00:18:48,in the Dead Sea and they were islands of tar
00:18:48,00:18:50,and the Egyptians liked to buy tar
00:18:50,00:18:53,because they were used in the mummifying process
00:18:53,00:18:54,for embalming and they were also used
00:18:54,00:18:56,for waterproofing boats.
00:18:56,00:18:58,And so the Nabatians went and swam out to these islands
00:18:58,00:19:01,"on the Dead Sea, easy to swim in it, 'cause you're flown."
00:19:01,00:19:03,"And they collected this bitumen, sold it to the Egyptians"
00:19:03,00:19:04,and that's how they got so rich
00:19:04,00:19:07,and that's how they had the biggest kingdom of that time.
00:19:07,00:19:08,- That is great.
00:19:08,00:19:09,- That's cool.
00:19:09,00:19:10,- That's really good.
00:19:10,00:19:11,- Love the Nabatians.
00:19:11,00:19:12,(laughing)
00:19:12,00:19:14,- Do you know someone who wrote about seashells
00:19:14,00:19:16,"was Edgar Allan Poe, did he?"
00:19:16,00:19:20,He wrote a book called The Conscientogist's First Book
00:19:20,00:19:22,and it was his best-selling book.
00:19:22,00:19:23,- Is it?
00:19:23,00:19:24,"- Yes, and also he didn't write it really."
00:19:24,00:19:28,"The original author said, can you rewrite this"
00:19:28,00:19:30,and sort of remix it in a cheaper way?
00:19:30,00:19:33,But like don't tell the publishers that you're doing this
00:19:33,00:19:35,'cause the publishers didn't want the author to do this
00:19:35,00:19:37,but the author wanted to make extra money.
00:19:37,00:19:40,- Like a spark notes version of the original book.
00:19:40,00:19:44,"So Poe needed the money, so he re-ordered the picture."
00:19:44,00:19:46,He wrote a preface.
00:19:46,00:19:48,"One of his biographers, Jeffrey Mayer's, said,"
00:19:48,00:19:51,"""Pose boring, pedantic and hair-splitting preface"
00:19:51,00:19:54,"""was absolutely guaranteed to torment and discourage"
00:19:54,00:19:56,"""even the most passionately interested schoolboy."""
00:19:56,00:19:58,(laughing)
00:19:58,00:20:01,- Do you know when the best time to buy petrol is?
00:20:01,00:20:03,- When your car is like 50% at least.
00:20:03,00:20:05,(laughing)
00:20:05,00:20:10,"- It's the winter, actually, because petrol gets more dense"
00:20:10,00:20:13,"when it's colder, and so that means you get more for your money."
00:20:13,00:20:15,So if you make sure you go and buy a capetra
00:20:15,00:20:17,"on a cold day, then more of it's gonna come out."
00:20:17,00:20:18,- Like how?
00:20:18,00:20:19,- 'Cause it's measured by volume.
00:20:19,00:20:20,- Like how metal expands when it's hot
00:20:20,00:20:22,so bridges change in length.
00:20:22,00:20:23,- Yeah.
00:20:23,00:20:24,- You get a different volume of petrol.
00:20:24,00:20:26,- Bridges don't expand that much in length.
00:20:26,00:20:26,- It's a bit.
00:20:26,00:20:28,"- Oh, we've been on this bridge for ages."
00:20:28,00:20:28,(laughing)
00:20:28,00:20:30,"Well, it's a very warm day."
00:20:30,00:20:31,(laughing)
00:20:31,00:20:33,- earliest oil drilling platform.
00:20:33,00:20:35,Do you guys know when it was?
00:20:35,00:20:36,Was it the Nabatians again?
00:20:36,00:20:37,(laughing)
00:20:37,00:20:39,"- That was collecting, not drilling."
00:20:39,00:20:41,"It was not, it was Chinese, obviously,"
00:20:41,00:20:43,as all great inventions seem to be.
00:20:43,00:20:45,"This is the third century BC,"
00:20:45,00:20:48,"and they drilled down 800 feet for oil,"
00:20:48,00:20:52,and they siphoned it up through bamboo poles.
00:20:52,00:20:54,"And the reason they did it was because salt was very valuable,"
00:20:54,00:20:56,"and they used oil to create fuel,"
00:20:56,00:21:00,"to create heat, to evaporate brine, so they're left salt."
00:21:00,00:21:03,And they had oil pipelines underground made of bamboo.
00:21:03,00:21:06,They were led from one like salt well to another.
00:21:06,00:21:07,- Come off it.
00:21:07,00:21:08,- Isn't that incredible?
00:21:08,00:21:10,- Bamboo pipelines.
00:21:10,00:21:11,- Apparently.
00:21:11,00:21:12,- It does not compute.
00:21:12,00:21:13,"- It was in a real book,"
00:21:13,00:21:14,and I'll look it up again later to check
00:21:14,00:21:18,that it wasn't crazy facts about oil by Mr. Muppet.
00:21:18,00:21:19,- Dan Schreiber.
00:21:19,00:21:20,(laughing)
00:21:20,00:21:24,So if you defecated at 650 degrees Fahrenheit
00:21:24,00:21:27,"with a pressure of 3,000 pounds per square inch,"
00:21:27,00:21:28,- It would burn.
00:21:28,00:21:31,"- It would, and your poo would turn into oil."
00:21:31,00:21:33,So oil is made through organic material
00:21:33,00:21:35,"which is pressurized,"
00:21:35,00:21:37,and that would give you the same effect by doing that.
00:21:37,00:21:40,"We've all had curries like that, haven't we?"
00:21:40,00:21:42,"- It doesn't mean we could take everyone's poo,"
00:21:42,00:21:43,"because it would be horrible,"
00:21:43,00:21:44,but if someone collected everyone's poo
00:21:44,00:21:46,"is going to put them in a hot, pressurized room."
00:21:46,00:21:47,- Yes.
00:21:47,00:21:48,- So why don't we do that?
00:21:48,00:21:50,"- Well, the reason being that the energy"
00:21:50,00:21:52,that you would need to create these conditions
00:21:52,00:21:55,is a lot more than the energy you would get from oil.
00:21:55,00:21:58,- It was a thermodynamics.
00:21:58,00:22:00,"- It's called hydrothermal liquid faction,"
00:22:00,00:22:02,and it's a report by the Pacific Northwest
00:22:02,00:22:05,"National Laboratory, where they..."
00:22:05,00:22:07,- Did they say the defecation thing?
00:22:07,00:22:08,- That was that of the Harkin Spin.
00:22:08,00:22:11,"- That is, yeah, that is a Harkin Spin."
00:22:11,00:22:15,"But they said if you put feces under these conditions,"
00:22:15,00:22:17,that would happen through a pipeline.
00:22:17,00:22:21,And what is pooing apart from feces going through a pipeline?
00:22:21,00:22:22,- That's true.
00:22:22,00:22:24,"- We should move on to him,"
00:22:24,00:22:25,but has anyone got anything else?
00:22:25,00:22:28,"- Oh, I was looking at other businesses"
00:22:28,00:22:29,"that originally saw different things,"
00:22:29,00:22:31,"and my favourite, which kind of makes sense"
00:22:31,00:22:32,"to me when you think about the name,"
00:22:32,00:22:35,"is American Express, do you know what they might have done first?"
00:22:35,00:22:36,- Travel or transport?
00:22:36,00:22:38,"- Sort of, so post."
00:22:38,00:22:39,"They were, because in those days,"
00:22:39,00:22:41,"so they were founded in 1850,"
00:22:41,00:22:44,"and the post, US Postal Zeros was sort of not"
00:22:44,00:22:45,"as, as it is today,"
00:22:45,00:22:49,and you could only post things as big as a regular letter size envelope.
00:22:49,00:22:51,"And so anything bigger, you'd go through an express company,"
00:22:51,00:22:52,"so sort of horse guys on horseback,"
00:22:52,00:22:55,and so on and forth from a transport that was around there.
00:22:55,00:22:56,- Like the pony express.
00:22:56,00:22:58,"- Yeah, and they would just take things."
00:22:58,00:22:59,And American Express found out
00:22:59,00:23:01,that they did a lot of business for banks
00:23:01,00:23:03,"and carrying things like stocks, certificates, and currency"
00:23:03,00:23:05,"was a lot more lucrative than carrying big bulky things,"
00:23:05,00:23:07,and so they specialised and made their own products.
00:23:07,00:23:08,"- Oh, that was really cool."
00:23:08,00:23:10,"- Because American Express, it makes sense."
00:23:10,00:23:10,- Yeah.
00:23:10,00:23:13,"- And my other favourite one is still the same product,"
00:23:13,00:23:15,but the guys who invented YouTube thought it was going to be
00:23:15,00:23:17,"a dating site to people that upload videos,"
00:23:17,00:23:18,"like for what they were looking for,"
00:23:18,00:23:19,and you see what they were like.
00:23:19,00:23:22,"- And then it turned out, no one is very camera friendly."
00:23:22,00:23:24,"- And we all like cats, but not in that way."
00:23:24,00:23:25,- Yeah.
00:23:25,00:23:28,(upbeat music)
00:23:29,00:23:31,(upbeat music)
00:23:31,00:23:33,"- Okay, we should move on to our final fact."
00:23:33,00:23:36,"And that is my fact, which is that when Mozart first performed"
00:23:36,00:23:39,"in Naples, he had to stop to take his ring off halfway through"
00:23:39,00:23:42,'cause the audience complained it was a magic ring.
00:23:42,00:23:43,(laughing)
00:23:43,00:23:45,- A magic ring through which he was producing oil.
00:23:45,00:23:48,"- Oh, yeah, that's 650 predators."
00:23:48,00:23:49,- Oh dear.
00:23:49,00:23:51,(laughing)
00:23:51,00:23:53,"- That's disgusting, but it wasn't that kind of ring"
00:23:53,00:23:53,they were referring to.
00:23:53,00:23:55,"- But Mozart would have liked that, wouldn't he?"
00:23:55,00:23:57,'Cause he had a dirty mind.
00:23:57,00:23:59,"- Yeah, he had a sense of humor."
00:23:59,00:24:01,- He was right about his fights and things.
00:24:01,00:24:04,"- He was obsessively scatological actually, wasn't it?"
00:24:04,00:24:06,And I think people have really tried to analyze this
00:24:06,00:24:10,"and work out why, but he, so he wrote to his cousin"
00:24:10,00:24:13,"quite rude letters very often, and one of them, for instance,"
00:24:13,00:24:15,"was, ""Well, I wish you good night."
00:24:15,00:24:17,"""This is a swear warning for any listeners."""
00:24:17,00:24:19,"He said, ""Well, I wish you good night,"
00:24:19,00:24:21,"""but first, shit in your bed and make it burst."
00:24:21,00:24:23,"""Sleep soundly, my love."
00:24:23,00:24:25,"""Into your mouth, your ass, your shove."""
00:24:25,00:24:26,- What?
00:24:26,00:24:27,"- And then he wrote another one saying,"
00:24:27,00:24:30,"""I pull on your nose so it runs down your chin."""
00:24:30,00:24:31,(groaning)
00:24:31,00:24:32,(laughing)
00:24:32,00:24:35,"- He also wrote a lot of really good stuff, guys."
00:24:35,00:24:36,(laughing)
00:24:36,00:24:37,- Like some of the good stuff.
00:24:37,00:24:37,- Yeah.
00:24:37,00:24:39,- He wrote enough music that it would take you
00:24:39,00:24:41,two hundred and two hours to listen to all of it.
00:24:41,00:24:42,- Wow.
00:24:42,00:24:43,- It's pretty cool.
00:24:43,00:24:44,- I think they might.
00:24:44,00:24:45,This brings above classic FM.
00:24:45,00:24:46,I think they might have just released
00:24:46,00:24:49,the complete Mozart 200 hours.
00:24:49,00:24:50,- Two hundred and two.
00:24:50,00:24:52,"- Two hundred, maybe they skipped off the last two."
00:24:52,00:24:54,That was all the poo stuff.
00:24:54,00:24:56,"- Yeah, it was the best-selling CD of last year, wasn't it?"
00:24:56,00:24:57,Or more CDs?
00:24:57,00:25:00,More Mozart CDs were sold than any other artist last year.
00:25:00,00:25:03,- Mozart loved poo.
00:25:03,00:25:03,- Yeah.
00:25:03,00:25:06,- It's possible that poo loves Mozart.
00:25:06,00:25:09,There is a sewage treatment plant in Switzerland.
00:25:09,00:25:13,"And in 2010, they started playing Mozart to the waist."
00:25:13,00:25:14,- No.
00:25:14,00:25:15,- Yes.
00:25:15,00:25:16,- No.
00:25:16,00:25:17,- And what?
00:25:17,00:25:18,- I don't know if he's seen Flava.
00:25:18,00:25:20,(laughing)
00:25:20,00:25:22,- They claimed that the music's vibrations
00:25:22,00:25:24,"would help the organisms, the microbes in it,"
00:25:24,00:25:27,to break down the waist and the cadences
00:25:27,00:25:28,and all of these things.
00:25:28,00:25:29,So they developed a process to play it.
00:25:29,00:25:32,And the man who ran the place is a guy called Anton Stuckey.
00:25:32,00:25:34,And he said he wasn't actually a fan of Mozart.
00:25:34,00:25:35,They had to convince him quite strongly
00:25:35,00:25:37,that it would work to do it.
00:25:37,00:25:39,"I don't know if they're still doing it, but they did start."
00:25:39,00:25:44,"- Interestingly, if you take human eggs in IVF,"
00:25:44,00:25:49,they grow better if you play techno music to them.
00:25:49,00:25:50,- Really?
00:25:50,00:25:52,- Last week in some study or other.
00:25:52,00:25:53,- Wow.
00:25:53,00:25:55,- So is this vibration we're thinking?
00:25:55,00:25:56,- Yeah.
00:25:56,00:25:56,"- That's vibration, yeah."
00:25:56,00:25:58,- I'm just really like to have an adjective explain my fact
00:25:58,00:26:00,'cause you all derailed me with your scatological--
00:26:00,00:26:02,"- Sorry, magic ring, yeah."
00:26:02,00:26:03,- Magic ring.
00:26:03,00:26:05,So he was doing this concert in Naples.
00:26:05,00:26:09,He was 14 years old and it was in 1770.
00:26:09,00:26:11,And at rumour been spreading anywhere
00:26:11,00:26:13,that he was using magic powers to play.
00:26:13,00:26:15,That the audience refused to be entertained.
00:26:15,00:26:18,So they refused to applaud and they just didn't see it
00:26:18,00:26:20,as impressive 'cause they assumed his power was coming
00:26:20,00:26:21,from this magic ring.
00:26:21,00:26:22,"So halfway through his performance,"
00:26:22,00:26:24,he had to stop and take off his ring.
00:26:24,00:26:26,"And at that point, apparently,"
00:26:26,00:26:28,the audience gassed in astonishment and fear
00:26:28,00:26:30,while crossing themselves.
00:26:30,00:26:35,"- I went onto the Wikipedia for magic rings, there is one."
00:26:35,00:26:38,"And it starts off, a magic ring is a ring,"
00:26:38,00:26:40,usually a figure ring.
00:26:40,00:26:43,(laughing)
00:26:43,00:26:45,- I wonder what these magic cock rinks are.
00:26:45,00:26:46,- Oh my god.
00:26:46,00:26:47,"- It's a toe ring, James."
00:26:47,00:26:48,- I don't know about toe rings.
00:26:48,00:26:50,"- Toe ring, or earring, it could be, I guess."
00:26:50,00:26:52,"- No, the way my mind went that."
00:26:52,00:26:53,(laughing)
00:26:53,00:26:56,"- Yeah, magic ring is a ring, usually a figure ring"
00:26:56,00:26:58,that has magical properties.
00:26:58,00:26:59,- Great.
00:26:59,00:27:00,- Makes a lot of sense.
00:27:00,00:27:02,I should say I found this fact in a book called
00:27:02,00:27:05,Time Keepers by Simon Garfield and it's amazing.
00:27:05,00:27:06,"And you should buy it, I'm loving it."
00:27:06,00:27:08,I'm about quarter of the way through.
00:27:08,00:27:10,He's brilliant.
00:27:10,00:27:12,"- So I didn't know, I knew most of it was a child prodigy."
00:27:12,00:27:14,I didn't know quite how much of one he was.
00:27:14,00:27:16,So he could play the harp in the violin
00:27:16,00:27:18,"at the edge of about three, or he started playing that."
00:27:18,00:27:20,"When he was five, he was quite good."
00:27:20,00:27:22,"And then his father took him on tour, age six,"
00:27:22,00:27:26,"for three and a half years, playing across Europe."
00:27:26,00:27:29,"And with his sister as well, who doesn't get as much credit."
00:27:29,00:27:30,- Was his sister better?
00:27:30,00:27:33,I read somewhere that his sister was a better musician.
00:27:33,00:27:34,- I don't think so.
00:27:34,00:27:35,"- I start off with, 'cause she was older."
00:27:35,00:27:38,"- I think, didn't she trans, 'cause he would play,"
00:27:38,00:27:40,I think she would transcribe.
00:27:40,00:27:41,And there's some thought that she had more influence
00:27:41,00:27:43,since he was given credit for.
00:27:43,00:27:44,- Interesting.
00:27:44,00:27:46,"- Yeah, and he could, I read this."
00:27:46,00:27:47,"I can't, I don't know if I believe it."
00:27:47,00:27:49,He could write music before you could write words.
00:27:49,00:27:51,- You can sort of believe it.
00:27:51,00:27:53,- It's easier to write blobs on manuscripts
00:27:53,00:27:55,than it is to write actual letters.
00:27:55,00:27:56,- Yeah.
00:27:56,00:27:58,"- It is very interesting psychologically,"
00:27:58,00:28:01,because he is the original child prodigy.
00:28:01,00:28:03,And you've got to wonder what effects it had.
00:28:03,00:28:05,"So when I was listening to, I used this podcast"
00:28:05,00:28:08,"as an excuse to listen to my genuinely favourite podcast,"
00:28:08,00:28:11,which is the Radio 3 composer of the week podcast.
00:28:11,00:28:11,"- Second, second."
00:28:11,00:28:13,- It's the genuinely favourite podcast.
00:28:13,00:28:14,- Second favourite.
00:28:14,00:28:16,- Radio allows my favourite.
00:28:16,00:28:19,(all laughing)
00:28:19,00:28:22,"And yeah, he was, and people were amazed at him."
00:28:22,00:28:23,And it must have affected him hugely.
00:28:23,00:28:26,"And apparently, when he got older, he was very angry"
00:28:26,00:28:28,that people didn't treat him with the same kind of
00:28:28,00:28:30,"amazement and deference, 'cause once he was a grown-up,"
00:28:30,00:28:33,he was just an incredibly talented musician and composer.
00:28:33,00:28:37,"But as a child, he was like this magic genius."
00:28:37,00:28:38,So he used to get very annoyed.
00:28:38,00:28:39,- But it's really rough.
00:28:39,00:28:41,- Because he will be a better player than he was
00:28:41,00:28:43,"and he was a kid, but rather than be admired"
00:28:43,00:28:44,for being better at more skilled.
00:28:44,00:28:46,"- Oh, everyone's gone, oh, you're not cute."
00:28:46,00:28:46,- Yeah.
00:28:46,00:28:49,- It's like someone who's absolute best year
00:28:49,00:28:51,was the first year of university.
00:28:51,00:28:56,And they can never quite get back that magic again.
00:28:56,00:28:57,- That is the story of my life.
00:28:57,00:28:58,(all laughing)
00:28:58,00:29:01,- So Mozart's first name was John.
00:29:01,00:29:06,"Johannes, Chrysostom, Wolf Gangus, Theophilus, Mozart."
00:29:06,00:29:09,And he was named after St. John Chrysostom.
00:29:09,00:29:13,And I was reading about the story of St. John Chrysostom.
00:29:13,00:29:14,And it's quite good.
00:29:14,00:29:16,He was living in the desert.
00:29:16,00:29:18,And then a princess came to his cave
00:29:18,00:29:20,'cause she was being attacked by animals.
00:29:20,00:29:22,And he didn't really want her to move into his cave
00:29:22,00:29:25,because he was worried that he might have sex with her.
00:29:25,00:29:29,And so what he did was like some kind of 1966 sitcom.
00:29:29,00:29:31,He drew a line in the middle of his cave
00:29:31,00:29:33,"and said, ""I'll stay on my side of the line"
00:29:33,00:29:35,"""and you stay on your side of the line."""
00:29:35,00:29:39,"And then despite this, the synophonication was committed."
00:29:39,00:29:40,- Ah.
00:29:40,00:29:43,"- And in a tent to hide it, he threw her off a cliff."
00:29:43,00:29:47,"- What, I just tell her to keep it quiet with her friends."
00:29:47,00:29:48,- That's her off a cliff.
00:29:48,00:29:50,- It was a different time.
00:29:50,00:29:52,- It was a bit of the '70s.
00:29:52,00:29:53,- '70s. - '70s.
00:29:53,00:29:54,- '70s.
00:29:54,00:29:56,(all laughing)
00:29:56,00:29:59,"- Then he went to Rome to beg for absolution,"
00:29:59,00:30:00,which was refused.
00:30:00,00:30:02,- Only for the murderer for the sex.
00:30:02,00:30:04,"- For the murder, really."
00:30:04,00:30:05,"- I'd like to be absolved from murder, please,"
00:30:05,00:30:07,but with a sex chaser.
00:30:07,00:30:09,(all laughing)
00:30:09,00:30:11,"- At the beginning when he said a princess comes into his cave,"
00:30:11,00:30:12,"I was thinking, ""Oh, it sounds a bit like"
00:30:12,00:30:14,"""the beginning of Notting Hill."""
00:30:14,00:30:16,(all laughing)
00:30:16,00:30:18,- 'Cause that's where the celebrity comes
00:30:18,00:30:20,into Hugh Grant's bookshop in Notting Hill.
00:30:20,00:30:22,Like a very famous wealthy person
00:30:22,00:30:23,comes into the life of an ordinary man.
00:30:23,00:30:25,- I've not seen Notting Hill.
00:30:25,00:30:26,Does he then throw off a cliff?
00:30:26,00:30:28,(all laughing)
00:30:28,00:30:33,"Anyway, so then he lived like a beast, crawling on all fours"
00:30:33,00:30:35,and feeding on wild grasses and roots.
00:30:35,00:30:38,And then the princess reappeared alive
00:30:38,00:30:40,with the saint's baby.
00:30:40,00:30:41,- What?
00:30:41,00:30:42,- Okay.
00:30:42,00:30:44,- And the baby miraculously pronounced his sins
00:30:44,00:30:46,to be forgiven.
00:30:46,00:30:48,And that was the miracle that made him into a saint's.
00:30:48,00:30:49,- Very forgiving of the baby.
00:30:49,00:30:51,"- Was she brought back to life by God,"
00:30:51,00:30:53,"or was she, did she just survive being thrown off a cliff?"
00:30:53,00:30:55,- We don't see that.
00:30:55,00:30:56,We don't see that.
00:30:56,00:30:57,- The haven't asked it off screen.
00:30:57,00:30:59,"- Yeah, you have to infer it from yourself."
00:30:59,00:31:03,Like it's one of those stories where it could be one
00:31:03,00:31:03,or it could be the other.
00:31:03,00:31:05,Like the end of inception.
00:31:05,00:31:07,(all laughing)
00:31:07,00:31:08,- I thought you could only become a saint
00:31:08,00:31:10,by doing three amazing things.
00:31:10,00:31:12,I didn't realize you could just get a baby to forgive you.
00:31:12,00:31:13,- He's done three amazing things.
00:31:13,00:31:15,He's had sex with the princess.
00:31:15,00:31:16,He's lived like a beast.
00:31:16,00:31:18,(all laughing)
00:31:18,00:31:19,- And he's been to Rome.
00:31:19,00:31:19,- He's been to Rome.
00:31:19,00:31:21,- And he's got a talking baby.
00:31:21,00:31:24,"It's basically not in Hill, mixed with inception."
00:31:24,00:31:25,- Looks like he's talking.
00:31:25,00:31:27,(all laughing)
00:31:27,00:31:30,- And that's the story of Mozart.
00:31:30,00:31:32,"- Mozart got a lot of bad reviews, interestingly."
00:31:32,00:31:36,"Even during life, probably used a magic ring one star."
00:31:36,00:31:38,(all laughing)
00:31:38,00:31:39,- Fake.
00:31:39,00:31:40,- And so these were phrases that we used about him.
00:31:40,00:31:44,"Too strongly spiced, impenetrable labyrinths,"
00:31:44,00:31:47,"bizarre flights of the soul, and overloaded,"
00:31:47,00:31:48,and overstuffed.
00:31:48,00:31:49,- Really?
00:31:49,00:31:52,"- Yeah, so it wasn't all completely positive."
00:31:52,00:31:53,I was not saying he was bad at music.
00:31:53,00:31:55,(all laughing)
00:31:55,00:31:56,- He was one of the haters.
00:31:56,00:31:57,"- He may have died, this is interesting."
00:31:57,00:32:00,He may have died because he got too little sunlight.
00:32:00,00:32:01,- Pretty.
00:32:01,00:32:02,"- Yeah, 'cause he died so young."
00:32:02,00:32:04,He was 35 when he died.
00:32:04,00:32:07,And he was very nocturnal towards the end of his life.
00:32:07,00:32:10,"And where he was living, he died about three months"
00:32:10,00:32:11,into the winter.
00:32:11,00:32:13,And there's a theory that a contributory factor
00:32:13,00:32:17,"was lack of vitamin D, 'cause you can't make vitamin D"
00:32:17,00:32:18,if you don't get sunlight.
00:32:18,00:32:21,"So, and there are so many other theories though,"
00:32:21,00:32:24,there are about 20 theories at least of what killed him.
00:32:24,00:32:26,"- He was also rejected in other ways,"
00:32:26,00:32:28,so he was rejected in love.
00:32:28,00:32:30,"By the first woman he fell in love with, actually,"
00:32:30,00:32:34,"a loisier Weber, and he ended up marrying her sister,"
00:32:34,00:32:35,but he fell in love with her at first.
00:32:35,00:32:37,"And when asked after his death why she'd turned him down,"
00:32:37,00:32:39,"she just said, ""I did not know."
00:32:39,00:32:41,"""I only thought he was such a little man."""
00:32:41,00:32:43,Rejected 'cause he was too small.
00:32:43,00:32:48,"And then another person, the print select of Bavaria,"
00:32:48,00:32:51,"once heard him play, and then afterwards said,"
00:32:51,00:32:53,"""Who would believe that such great things"
00:32:53,00:32:55,"""could be hidden in so small a head?"""
00:32:55,00:32:57,So he obviously had a smallness problem
00:32:57,00:32:59,that perhaps he was trying to compensate for.
00:32:59,00:33:01,- He must've been hard for him to play music
00:33:01,00:33:02,with such small hunts.
00:33:02,00:33:06,"- And he ran up and down the keys, like big."
00:33:06,00:33:08,(all laughing)
00:33:08,00:33:10,- Maybe there's anything about him not getting
00:33:10,00:33:11,if he was indoors and not getting up with him in D
00:33:11,00:33:13,"'cause you need that to grow, right?"
00:33:13,00:33:14,- Yes.
00:33:14,00:33:15,- This is a cracking theory.
00:33:15,00:33:17,This is the kind of thing that bullshit science studies
00:33:17,00:33:20,"get written about, was Mozart too small"
00:33:20,00:33:23,'cause he didn't know enough with him in D?
00:33:23,00:33:25,"- Okay, we should round up pretty soon."
00:33:25,00:33:26,Has anyone got anything else?
00:33:26,00:33:28,"- Oh, I just have one thing, which I'm not sure is true,"
00:33:28,00:33:30,but I like it so much I wanted to say.
00:33:30,00:33:32,Mozart probably had a fear of trumpets
00:33:32,00:33:34,"and I read somewhere that to cure him of this,"
00:33:34,00:33:36,his father hired someone to follow him around
00:33:36,00:33:40,with a trumpet and blast the noise and raise him.
00:33:40,00:33:43,"I don't care if it's not true 'cause I really like that, yeah."
00:33:43,00:33:45,I can kind of know what I know about Mozart's father.
00:33:45,00:33:47,I can totally imagine that.
00:33:47,00:33:48,"- Yeah, I can totally imagine that."
00:33:48,00:33:48,"- Yeah, I can totally imagine that."
00:33:48,00:33:50,- Is he a slave driver?
00:33:50,00:33:51,"- A little bit, I think."
00:33:51,00:33:53,- If it is six-year-old on tour for three years.
00:33:53,00:33:53,- Yeah.
00:33:53,00:33:54,(all laughing)
00:33:54,00:33:56,- And his son liked him.
00:33:56,00:33:58,- Stunned to his grave.
00:33:58,00:33:59,(all laughing)
00:33:59,00:34:00,"- Okay, yeah."
00:34:00,00:34:02,- He's deliberately shrunk his own son.
00:34:02,00:34:03,"Like, honey, I shrunk the kids."
00:34:03,00:34:05,(all laughing)
00:34:05,00:34:08,(upbeat music)
00:34:08,00:34:15,"- Okay, we should have finished on the election and reference."
00:34:15,00:34:17,That's all of our facts for this week.
00:34:17,00:34:19,We'll be back the end next week with another episode
