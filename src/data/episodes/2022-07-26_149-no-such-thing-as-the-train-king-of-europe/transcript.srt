1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,320
 - Oh, yeah.

2
00:00:02,320 --> 00:00:04,400
 - [speaking in foreign language]

3
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:07,480
 [theme music]

4
00:00:07,480 --> 00:00:09,720
 - [speaking in foreign language]

5
00:00:09,720 --> 00:00:13,960
 [theme music]

6
00:00:13,960 --> 00:00:16,160
 - Hello and welcome to No Such Things A Fish,

7
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:18,440
 a weekly podcast coming to you from the queue.

8
00:00:18,440 --> 00:00:20,400
 I offer this in Covent Garden.

9
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:23,960
 My name is Anna and I am here with Andrew Hunter Murray,

10
00:00:23,960 --> 00:00:26,040
 James Harkin and Anne Miller.

11
00:00:26,040 --> 00:00:28,120
 Once again, we've gathered around the microphones

12
00:00:28,120 --> 00:00:31,480
 with our four favorite maps that we found in the last seven days

13
00:00:31,480 --> 00:00:33,280
 and in no particular order.

14
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:36,440
 Here we go, starting with you, James.

15
00:00:36,440 --> 00:00:38,840
 - My fact this week is that Anna wants to be like

16
00:00:38,840 --> 00:00:41,040
 with Donna and known by just one name.

17
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:43,480
 [laughing]

18
00:00:43,480 --> 00:00:44,920
 - What is that all about?

19
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:47,600
 - Did I, I couldn't work out if normally we do two names

20
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:48,800
 or one side mix it up?

21
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:50,200
 - I thought it was casual and friendly.

22
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:51,480
 Like, don't enough podcast now.

23
00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:52,920
 - I thought it was power mad.

24
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:54,160
 [laughing]

25
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:56,160
 - I thought it was maybe that you could work out

26
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:57,720
 to pronounce your old surname.

27
00:00:57,720 --> 00:00:59,400
 [laughing]

28
00:00:59,400 --> 00:01:02,280
 - It might have been that dance confused me over the years.

29
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:03,880
 - I'd like to be known as Lightning from now

30
00:01:03,880 --> 00:01:05,080
 and I'm this podcast, please.

31
00:01:05,080 --> 00:01:05,920
 - All right, that's fine.

32
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:06,760
 - You've already got three calls.

33
00:01:06,760 --> 00:01:08,680
 - So I'll introduce you all again.

34
00:01:08,680 --> 00:01:12,800
 My name is Anna and I'm joined by Lightning, James and Anne.

35
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:13,640
 [laughing]

36
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:14,880
 - I'm followed.

37
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:18,440
 - Okay, my fact this week is that in 1758,

38
00:01:18,440 --> 00:01:20,920
 there were two camels on display in London,

39
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:23,600
 one with a single hump and one with two humps.

40
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:26,440
 They were advertised as the surprising camel

41
00:01:26,440 --> 00:01:27,880
 and the wonderful camel.

42
00:01:27,880 --> 00:01:29,480
 [laughing]

43
00:01:29,480 --> 00:01:31,000
 - Yeah, which was it?

44
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:35,360
 - I think the one with a single hump was surprising

45
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:37,080
 and the one with two humps was wonderful.

46
00:01:37,080 --> 00:01:39,040
 - I think they're all surprising to start off with.

47
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:39,880
 - Yeah, I agree.

48
00:01:39,880 --> 00:01:42,120
 - And then a difference in humps is also surprising.

49
00:01:42,120 --> 00:01:43,800
 So I think they're both surprising.

50
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:44,640
 - Are they?

51
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:45,480
 - I think it was wonderful.

52
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:46,640
 - Yeah. - Let's not do camels down there.

53
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:47,640
 - I agree with Lightning.

54
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:49,800
 [laughing]

55
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:52,000
 I read this in the London Review of Books

56
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:55,440
 and it was a review of a book called "Managerie"

57
00:01:55,440 --> 00:01:57,040
 by Caroline Griggsson.

58
00:01:57,040 --> 00:01:59,480
 I haven't read that book yet, but I am going to read it

59
00:01:59,480 --> 00:02:00,480
 'cause it looks amazing.

60
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:02,560
 There's some really good facts in that review.

61
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:04,400
 - I read a really good book about the history of London

62
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:05,640
 and zoo a couple of years ago.

63
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:07,640
 My favorite thing in the whole book was that London zoo

64
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:08,800
 used to be at the Tower of London

65
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:10,720
 and when it was there, you could get in for free

66
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:13,280
 if you brought a dog or a cat to feed to the lions.

67
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:14,120
 - Nice.

68
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:16,320
 Was it entry for one or was it for a family?

69
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:17,560
 Or did you have to bring kittens

70
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:19,480
 if you wanted your children to go and see the lions?

71
00:02:19,480 --> 00:02:20,600
 - I think if you were bringing a family,

72
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:21,960
 you had to bring a surprising camel.

73
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:23,960
 [laughing]

74
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:26,160
 - So one other thing that I saw 'cause yeah,

75
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:27,680
 that book does look incredible, doesn't it?

76
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:29,720
 And one other thing that I really like that she spotted

77
00:02:29,720 --> 00:02:33,200
 is that this was in the age where it was very fashionable

78
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:34,440
 if you're a wealthy person to bring

79
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:36,560
 back lots of exotic animals from various places

80
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:38,360
 or descend agents off to get them

81
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:40,960
 and apparently one London merchant asked his agent

82
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:43,640
 to send him two or three apes,

83
00:02:43,640 --> 00:02:46,240
 but he forgot the "R" on "Or"

84
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:49,160
 and so he was delivered 203 apes.

85
00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:50,160
 [laughing]

86
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:51,520
 - Where did he put them?

87
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:52,360
 - I don't know.

88
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:53,200
 - I don't know.

89
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:55,560
 Apparently the first cargo of "80 apes" arrived

90
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:57,400
 when the legs are promising them more.

91
00:02:57,400 --> 00:02:58,560
 [laughing]

92
00:02:58,560 --> 00:02:59,560
 - There was one other thing in there

93
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:03,600
 that George the Fourth had a giraffe at Windsor

94
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:05,760
 and the giraffe didn't flourish very well

95
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:06,760
 because it was in Windsor

96
00:03:06,760 --> 00:03:09,200
 and not where it's supposed to live in Africa.

97
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:10,200
 - Which is a Sandriggum.

98
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:12,480
 [laughing]

99
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:15,280
 - And when it got sick, they put it down to sympathy

100
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:19,800
 for the King's gout and load of peon nonsense.

101
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:22,400
 - sympathy for the gout, that's outrageous.

102
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:25,160
 - You can say that or in an alternative fact universe,

103
00:03:25,160 --> 00:03:27,880
 you can say that maybe it was feeling sad

104
00:03:27,880 --> 00:03:28,880
 'cause the King was sad.

105
00:03:28,880 --> 00:03:29,720
 - Maybe it was sad.

106
00:03:29,720 --> 00:03:31,640
 - Do you know they have camel wrestling festivals

107
00:03:31,640 --> 00:03:32,480
 in Turkey?

108
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:34,520
 - Is that camel's wrestling against each other?

109
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:36,200
 - It is camel's wrestling against each other.

110
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:37,040
 Yeah.

111
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:37,880
 - But how does a camel wrestle?

112
00:03:37,880 --> 00:03:39,040
 - Yeah, they're on all fours.

113
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:40,840
 - Well, with great difficulty.

114
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:41,680
 - Yeah.

115
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:43,120
 - It's the odd joke.

116
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:45,040
 They, I don't know if they do it with camels,

117
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:46,640
 but often they do it by showing

118
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:50,240
 the two competence, a sexy lady insert animal here.

119
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:52,000
 So they might bring on a sexy lady camel

120
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,920
 and then remove it and then the two blokes remaining

121
00:03:54,920 --> 00:03:56,120
 say, "Well, I want it, well, I want it."

122
00:03:56,120 --> 00:03:58,000
 And little did they know they're not gonna get it.

123
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,960
 - Do you know what constitutes a beautiful camel

124
00:03:59,960 --> 00:04:01,560
 since you mentioned a sexy lady?

125
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:02,720
 - Long eyelashes.

126
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:03,880
 - Yeah, of course, the eyelashes.

127
00:04:03,880 --> 00:04:05,120
 - They do, have lots of wine lashes.

128
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:06,160
 Although maybe in the camel world

129
00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:07,760
 'cause that's so common then short eyelashes,

130
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:08,920
 lovely lady humps.

131
00:04:08,920 --> 00:04:12,000
 [laughing]

132
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,800
 So I've been reading about Omar lately

133
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:15,160
 'cause we're researching for the O series

134
00:04:15,160 --> 00:04:18,120
 when they have camel beauty contests in Oman.

135
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:19,440
 And they're put on by the government

136
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:22,160
 and it's a milking and beauty contest.

137
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:24,840
 And a beautiful camel apparently should have

138
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:27,200
 a well-proportioned body and face,

139
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:31,200
 a long garib, which is the area between the hump and the neck,

140
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:33,760
 a clear and huge hump.

141
00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:34,760
 [laughing]

142
00:04:34,760 --> 00:04:35,600
 It needs to have...

143
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:36,960
 - This was written by men, wasn't it?

144
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:39,120
 [laughing]

145
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:43,320
 - Firm ears and pouty lips, big whiskers,

146
00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:45,040
 and a fur shimmer.

147
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:45,880
 - Right.

148
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:48,880
 - Yeah, and he's good posture and it needs to be huge.

149
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:50,440
 [laughing]

150
00:04:50,440 --> 00:04:52,160
 - That kind of makes sense, all that stuff.

151
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:53,600
 - That does sounds quite attractive, isn't it?

152
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:55,480
 - Is it of both sexes?

153
00:04:55,480 --> 00:04:57,760
 As in, the male camel's compete against female camels

154
00:04:57,760 --> 00:04:59,240
 that just has to be a beautiful camel.

155
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:00,080
 - Yes.

156
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:00,920
 - Really?

157
00:05:00,920 --> 00:05:01,760
 - Yeah.

158
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:03,440
 I don't think you can tell a male a female camel apart

159
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:04,440
 by looking at it.

160
00:05:04,440 --> 00:05:05,600
 - I bet you can.

161
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:06,440
 [laughing]

162
00:05:06,440 --> 00:05:07,280
 - Where you're looking.

163
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:09,400
 [laughing]

164
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:11,520
 - In the 18th century, there was a collection

165
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:13,560
 of camels on display on the strand,

166
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:14,480
 just around the corner from us.

167
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:16,320
 So it was at the toll but in in the strand,

168
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:18,960
 and it belonged to a man called Richard Hepenstool.

169
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:20,160
 And so that's exactly where

170
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:21,560
 all the tube station used to be,

171
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:23,400
 which I think is just a little bit, isn't it?

172
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:26,880
 He tried to lure women in to view his herd of camels,

173
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:28,200
 because at the time women were afraid

174
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:31,160
 there would be a bit dirty and a bit spitty and a bit smelly.

175
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:35,840
 So he advertised them as having breath as sweet as a salz,

176
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:37,400
 which is weird, 'cause I didn't think a salz

177
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:39,200
 is having particularly sweet breath.

178
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:40,880
 But apparently, soon afterwards,

179
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:42,880
 there was a journal article or a newspaper article

180
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:45,720
 that reported that the ladies are especially charmed

181
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:47,760
 by the camels and express great satisfaction

182
00:05:47,760 --> 00:05:49,840
 at the sweetness of their breath.

183
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:51,520
 - See, that's quite high-risk, because I read

184
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:52,600
 that when a camel spits at you,

185
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:54,040
 it's also kind of bombing at you,

186
00:05:54,040 --> 00:05:56,000
 'cause the content of their stomach comes up as well.

187
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,240
 - Yeah, it's not a spits, is it?

188
00:05:57,240 --> 00:05:58,080
 - Yeah, really?

189
00:05:58,080 --> 00:05:59,440
 Oh, it's just spitting, no.

190
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:01,520
 Maybe that's what generated such sweet breath, though.

191
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:02,520
 [laughing]

192
00:06:02,520 --> 00:06:04,120
 - Do you know what you could get from a camel?

193
00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:05,400
 - What? - If it spat at you,

194
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:08,920
 a cold because one of the four common cold viruses

195
00:06:08,920 --> 00:06:10,480
 originated in camels.

196
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:11,320
 - No.

197
00:06:11,320 --> 00:06:12,160
 - Really?

198
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:13,000
 - And spread to humans.

199
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,480
 - This is according to the German Center

200
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:15,800
 for Infection Research.

201
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:19,040
 Yeah, and there are four global human,

202
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:20,280
 they're called coronaviruses,

203
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:22,120
 and there are also things called rhinoviruses,

204
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:23,440
 rhino-meaning nose.

205
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:24,680
 - They come from rhinos.

206
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:26,960
 - Yep.

207
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:28,440
 [laughing]

208
00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:29,920
 And so one of these, one of these main ones,

209
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:31,560
 apparently, has made its way over from camels.

210
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:33,240
 At a long time ago, I don't know if you could still

211
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:35,480
 get the same virus inhabiting both,

212
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:37,880
 or whether it's come over, and now it's only humans.

213
00:06:37,880 --> 00:06:39,040
 Not sure. - Wow.

214
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:39,880
 - Yeah, still.

215
00:06:39,880 --> 00:06:40,720
 - I didn't know that.

216
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:43,920
 Firstly, camel can drink as many as 30 gallons of water

217
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:46,040
 in 13 minutes.

218
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:46,880
 Okay.

219
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:48,720
 Which sounds impressive, but I worked that out,

220
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:51,640
 and that's 3.25 seconds per pint,

221
00:06:51,640 --> 00:06:54,040
 and I can drink a pint in less than three seconds.

222
00:06:54,040 --> 00:06:54,880
 - Right.

223
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:56,560
 - So I can drink faster than a camel.

224
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:58,600
 - It's shortened long fur longs, though, isn't it?

225
00:06:58,600 --> 00:07:00,080
 [laughing]

226
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:02,200
 - Well, I would be ahead after the first pint,

227
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:04,840
 but then by probably halfway through pint two,

228
00:07:04,840 --> 00:07:05,840
 it might overtake me.

229
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:07,000
 [laughing]

230
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:11,800
 And then by pint 240, be struggling a little bit.

231
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:13,440
 - So you just have to pick your race

232
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:15,920
 when you're challenging the camel to the drinking contest.

233
00:07:15,920 --> 00:07:16,760
 - Yeah.

234
00:07:16,760 --> 00:07:18,800
 - So when you say to the camel, I want a drinking contest,

235
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:21,480
 and he says, okay, let's do 240 pints, you know.

236
00:07:21,480 --> 00:07:23,920
 Well, let's start a one and see how we do that.

237
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:27,200
 And don't do double our quits on the next 239.

238
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:29,120
 [laughing]

239
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:31,040
 - I didn't realize that there are three kinds of camel.

240
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:33,560
 I thought dromedary and backtrune were the only kinds,

241
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:34,920
 but the wild backtrune's probably

242
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:36,520
 where I'd have different chromosomes.

243
00:07:36,520 --> 00:07:37,520
 - It's got three humps.

244
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:38,720
 [laughing]

245
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:40,880
 - Yeah, they did a DNA sequencing on it,

246
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:41,880
 and it's different species.

247
00:07:41,880 --> 00:07:43,680
 - Well, so we've mentioned before

248
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:46,400
 the Saudi Arabia imports camels from Australia,

249
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:48,200
 because for me, but actually now,

250
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:49,840
 have you heard that they're trying to rescue camels

251
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:50,840
 from Australia?

252
00:07:50,840 --> 00:07:53,120
 So Australia's got too many camels,

253
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:54,440
 apparently they're becoming a bit of a pest,

254
00:07:54,440 --> 00:07:56,040
 and they were threatening to coal.

255
00:07:56,040 --> 00:07:59,120
 I think 6,000 camels a few years ago,

256
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:00,480
 and there was a big campaign set up

257
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:02,080
 in Saudi Arabia and internet campaigns,

258
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:04,000
 saying send the camels to us instead,

259
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,240
 and we'll look after them.

260
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:07,760
 - Yeah, but Australia has a million feral camels,

261
00:08:07,760 --> 00:08:10,280
 so 6,000 is pretty small beer, actually.

262
00:08:10,280 --> 00:08:12,680
 I think we've said before, they shoot them from helicopters.

263
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:13,920
 - Yeah, they do, apparently one.

264
00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:15,360
 I think this was in the Australian.

265
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:16,920
 Apparently camels in Australia,

266
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:18,840
 smash water tanks destroy fences,

267
00:08:18,840 --> 00:08:21,280
 come up to houses and antagonize people.

268
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:22,280
 [laughing]

269
00:08:22,280 --> 00:08:23,600
 I don't know how a camel antagonist is.

270
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:25,040
 - That's just trying to blend in.

271
00:08:25,040 --> 00:08:26,840
 [laughing]

272
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:29,440
 [upbeat music]

273
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:33,760
 - Okay, onto fact number two,

274
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:36,280
 and that is Andy's back.

275
00:08:36,280 --> 00:08:38,080
 - Lightning's factor, then you'll find.

276
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:39,520
 [laughing]

277
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:41,760
 Okay, my fact is that before they are launched,

278
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:45,280
 London sends all its trains to Austria to be beaten up.

279
00:08:45,280 --> 00:08:46,360
 [laughing]

280
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:48,080
 So there's this wind tunnel,

281
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:49,920
 which is called the Rail-Tech Arsenal.

282
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:52,120
 There's a huge article on wire about them recently,

283
00:08:52,120 --> 00:08:54,840
 and the article describes them as train torture chambers,

284
00:08:54,840 --> 00:08:58,160
 so you can put a whole 330 foot long train in this tunnel,

285
00:08:58,160 --> 00:09:00,800
 and then they basically simulate extreme weather conditions

286
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:02,840
 and see how the carriages stand up to it,

287
00:09:02,840 --> 00:09:05,280
 so you can see what it'll be like for passengers,

288
00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:07,120
 if the train gets stuck in boiling sun,

289
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:09,760
 or snow, or what a huge wind conditions are.

290
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:11,520
 - That must be very confusing for the train,

291
00:09:11,520 --> 00:09:13,120
 because normally when he goes in the tunnel,

292
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:14,000
 there's no weather.

293
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,840
 [laughing]

294
00:09:16,840 --> 00:09:19,200
 - It's like a Thomas getting fucked up.

295
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:20,040
 [laughing]

296
00:09:20,040 --> 00:09:20,880
 About a CIA.

297
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:21,680
 [laughing]

298
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:23,640
 - Are we in danger of anthropomorphizing trains

299
00:09:23,640 --> 00:09:24,480
 a little bit, yeah?

300
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:25,640
 - Well, they shouldn't draw those faces on the front,

301
00:09:25,640 --> 00:09:26,480
 are they?

302
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:27,480
 [laughing]

303
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:28,320
 Yeah.

304
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:30,600
 - They do simulate conditions that they wouldn't necessarily

305
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:31,960
 come across in this country, don't they?

306
00:09:31,960 --> 00:09:34,640
 Don't they go down to a ridiculously low and high temperatures?

307
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:38,400
 - Well, the London ones, they only test to minus 13 Celsius,

308
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:40,440
 which is very, would be very low for London,

309
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:44,600
 but they can set it to minus 50 Fahrenheit.

310
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:45,360
 What would that be?

311
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:47,080
 It's, that's cold.

312
00:09:47,080 --> 00:09:48,200
 - That's really cold.

313
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:49,040
 [laughing]

314
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:52,040
 So trains from Kazakhstan get sent there as well,

315
00:09:52,040 --> 00:09:53,760
 and they'll have lower temperatures, probably.

316
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:55,280
 - Is everyone's trains go to this tunnel?

317
00:09:55,280 --> 00:09:58,360
 - Loads of Germany, America, Kazakhstan, Saudi Arabia,

318
00:09:58,360 --> 00:10:01,160
 they all, the article described as the Eaton College

319
00:10:01,160 --> 00:10:03,320
 of the train testing world.

320
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:05,480
 - Well, you got beaten up already, I guess.

321
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:07,200
 - You shoved the train in a toilet for a minute.

322
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:08,200
 [laughing]

323
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:10,360
 - You think if all the trains had to go through this tunnel,

324
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:13,440
 wouldn't it make sense for all the train factories to be in Vienna?

325
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:15,160
 - Yeah, I guess it would, but we've got,

326
00:10:15,160 --> 00:10:18,120
 I guess once you've built a train factory in Derby.

327
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:19,600
 - And how do you reckon they go,

328
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:22,040
 are they allowed to go on the train tracks to get to the tunnel?

329
00:10:22,040 --> 00:10:25,320
 Or do they have to go on a lorry because they're not pass safety?

330
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:26,680
 - Yeah, I think they get voted over.

331
00:10:26,680 --> 00:10:28,000
 - They do, they get seven of them.

332
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:28,840
 - Train some votes.

333
00:10:28,840 --> 00:10:29,680
 - Yeah.

334
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:32,560
 - You get trains which you can put cars on, don't you?

335
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:34,080
 I think we have one or two of those in Britain,

336
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:35,400
 but you get them especially abroad.

337
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:37,360
 - You put cars in the Urester.

338
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:41,880
 - I would just love to have a car on a train, on a boat.

339
00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:42,880
 [laughing]

340
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:45,200
 - I'd probably put like a bike rack on there as well.

341
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:47,120
 [laughing]

342
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:49,240
 - Oh, also they've got, I think it was in the news this week

343
00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:51,720
 or last week we've finally got a direct train service

344
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:53,440
 from Britain to China.

345
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:54,760
 I don't know why I say finally like we've all been

346
00:10:54,760 --> 00:10:55,880
 just pretty wasteful.

347
00:10:55,880 --> 00:10:57,200
 - We've all been stunned on the platform,

348
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:58,800
 but I've been here already a minute.

349
00:10:58,800 --> 00:10:59,640
 - Southern.

350
00:10:59,640 --> 00:11:02,160
 [laughing]

351
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:03,280
 - But you know, I think that's amazing.

352
00:11:03,280 --> 00:11:05,320
 It takes 18 days, it's a freight train,

353
00:11:05,320 --> 00:11:06,800
 so you have to be a piece of freight.

354
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:07,960
 [laughing]

355
00:11:07,960 --> 00:11:09,360
 - You're a piece of freight, right?

356
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:10,800
 [laughing]

357
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:13,720
 - But it goes to Yuwu, which is in East China,

358
00:11:13,720 --> 00:11:15,440
 and that's the place that provides 60%

359
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:16,960
 of the world's Christmas decorations.

360
00:11:16,960 --> 00:11:19,520
 And so I think it's like the new Santa's sleigh

361
00:11:19,520 --> 00:11:22,080
 and it goes direct from China to London,

362
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:24,360
 but that has to actually be lifted from one track

363
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:25,880
 to the other sometimes 'cause different countries

364
00:11:25,880 --> 00:11:27,400
 have different gauges. - Wow.

365
00:11:27,400 --> 00:11:28,760
 - Just on train testing,

366
00:11:28,760 --> 00:11:31,160
 do you know what the new measurement train is?

367
00:11:31,160 --> 00:11:32,000
 - No. - No?

368
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,520
 - This is this train that's constantly in operation

369
00:11:34,520 --> 00:11:36,360
 around the country, and it's to test all the tracks

370
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:38,080
 and it runs 125 miles an hour,

371
00:11:38,080 --> 00:11:39,920
 and it has various means of testing the track,

372
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:41,840
 so there are no passengers on it.

373
00:11:41,840 --> 00:11:44,200
 It was made in response to Hatfield,

374
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:45,840
 so that was the year 2000, wasn't it?

375
00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:48,360
 And, but it's got this amazing technology,

376
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:50,920
 so it can test tracks as people would have to

377
00:11:50,920 --> 00:11:53,320
 at a walking pace, but at 125 miles an hour,

378
00:11:53,320 --> 00:11:55,160
 by for instance firing lasers at them,

379
00:11:55,160 --> 00:11:57,080
 and it measures contact with the rails,

380
00:11:57,080 --> 00:11:59,280
 and it measures the electrical supply,

381
00:11:59,280 --> 00:12:01,680
 and you know in some places you need to have a tilt on trains,

382
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:04,040
 it checks that the tilt isn't too much,

383
00:12:04,040 --> 00:12:06,640
 so it won't crash into a cliff next to it or something.

384
00:12:06,640 --> 00:12:08,840
 And these are going running around the country at all times.

385
00:12:08,840 --> 00:12:10,680
 - So there are 100 mile an hour trains

386
00:12:10,680 --> 00:12:12,920
 going around the country firing lasers at things?

387
00:12:12,920 --> 00:12:14,440
 - Correct. - It's so cool.

388
00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:15,960
 - They're really cool, yeah.

389
00:12:15,960 --> 00:12:19,240
 - Have you heard about Operation Smash hit?

390
00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:21,240
 - Is it about 1970s pop stars?

391
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:23,320
 (laughing)

392
00:12:23,320 --> 00:12:24,520
 It's very well-known.

393
00:12:25,480 --> 00:12:27,320
 (laughing)

394
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:30,640
 No, it was an experiment that in 1984 in July,

395
00:12:30,640 --> 00:12:32,960
 by the British Central Electricity Generating Board,

396
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:35,200
 and what they did was they got a train,

397
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:37,800
 and they set it to smash at 100 miles an hour

398
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:39,640
 into a flask of nuclear waste.

399
00:12:39,640 --> 00:12:40,480
 - What?

400
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:41,320
 - A flask.

401
00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:43,560
 - And they televised this flask of nuclear waste.

402
00:12:43,560 --> 00:12:47,120
 - Yeah, so they had these new ways of storing nuclear material,

403
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:48,840
 as it does material in these flasks, right?

404
00:12:48,840 --> 00:12:51,240
 And very strongly built flasks.

405
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:52,520
 And they set one of these up on a track,

406
00:12:52,520 --> 00:12:54,000
 and they sort of wedged it into concrete.

407
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,520
 And this is an orbit of testing track,

408
00:12:55,520 --> 00:12:56,600
 and they didn't need to use any more.

409
00:12:56,600 --> 00:12:58,960
 And they got an old train, they didn't need.

410
00:12:58,960 --> 00:13:01,000
 And they set it going at it at 100 miles an hour.

411
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,520
 And then they put it on TV.

412
00:13:02,520 --> 00:13:04,400
 Millions of people watched it all around the world,

413
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:06,920
 and it was to show how safe these nuclear flasks were,

414
00:13:06,920 --> 00:13:08,240
 'cause it didn't break.

415
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:10,600
 - Oh wow. - They barely lost any of its pressure at all.

416
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:14,080
 It was, and this was the final of a series of experiments

417
00:13:14,080 --> 00:13:16,160
 they did where they like engulfed them in flames,

418
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:18,120
 these flask, and they dropped them from a big height.

419
00:13:18,120 --> 00:13:18,960
 - Amazing.

420
00:13:18,960 --> 00:13:20,880
 - And they did like all these loony tunes experiments

421
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:22,440
 just to show you cannot break into these.

422
00:13:22,440 --> 00:13:23,600
 It was to reassure the public.

423
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:26,040
 - And it's high risk though, 'cause one of those goes wrong.

424
00:13:26,040 --> 00:13:27,880
 Sorry we just wiped out the country.

425
00:13:27,880 --> 00:13:31,200
 - So France has had problems with trains lately.

426
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:33,080
 And I think it's important that we smash the myth

427
00:13:33,080 --> 00:13:34,720
 that France is the train king of Europe

428
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:38,120
 because in 2014, it's the train king of Europe.

429
00:13:38,120 --> 00:13:40,040
 - Yeah, come on then.

430
00:13:40,040 --> 00:13:43,520
 So who is the king of trains, the train king of Europe?

431
00:13:43,520 --> 00:13:45,600
 - Well, I think we should enter ourselves

432
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:47,600
 into the contest, 'cause France is out, right?

433
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:50,120
 In 2014, I think we've mentioned before,

434
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:51,760
 they made those trains that are too wide

435
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:53,120
 for their stations, do you remember?

436
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:55,400
 - So they built, they spent billions.

437
00:13:55,400 --> 00:13:57,000
 - That's pretty embarrassing for the train king

438
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,000
 of Europe to do that.

439
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,800
 (laughing)

440
00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:02,160
 - So this was, they'd spent 15 billion euros

441
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:03,360
 on these trains, they were too wide.

442
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:06,920
 So they had to amend thousands of platforms across France

443
00:14:06,920 --> 00:14:07,920
 so they fitted them.

444
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:09,920
 And then the following year, they made trains

445
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:12,280
 that are too tall to get through tunnels

446
00:14:12,280 --> 00:14:13,680
 to take them into Italy.

447
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:16,120
 - Wow, so who's gonna be your new train king of Europe, Hannah?

448
00:14:16,120 --> 00:14:18,160
 - Well, like I say, I think we're in with the shot, guys.

449
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:19,080
 - I would've thought Switzerland,

450
00:14:19,080 --> 00:14:20,800
 but I was on a train in Switzerland last week

451
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:23,640
 and it got cancelled and I had to walk across

452
00:14:23,640 --> 00:14:24,840
 to another platform.

453
00:14:24,840 --> 00:14:26,760
 - You wouldn't think that in Switzerland, would you?

454
00:14:26,760 --> 00:14:27,600
 - No, you wouldn't.

455
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:30,720
 - For me, they were always the train prince of Europe.

456
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:31,560
 (laughing)

457
00:14:31,560 --> 00:14:33,920
 - I have a nomination, I nominate Sweden

458
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:35,680
 because I went Stockholm a few years ago

459
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:38,000
 and the train there was so amazing.

460
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,360
 It was really lovely, it felt like first class,

461
00:14:40,360 --> 00:14:42,040
 it was a standard class and I had a sign up saying,

462
00:14:42,040 --> 00:14:43,160
 "If you're more than two minutes late,

463
00:14:43,160 --> 00:14:44,840
 "will we fund you in full?"

464
00:14:44,840 --> 00:14:46,040
 - Two minutes, yeah.

465
00:14:46,040 --> 00:14:46,880
 - Wow.

466
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:47,720
 - It wasn't the airport express train,

467
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:49,160
 but I was a pretty good deal.

468
00:14:49,160 --> 00:14:51,520
 So I nominate Sweden for a train king.

469
00:14:51,520 --> 00:14:52,360
 - Okay.

470
00:14:52,360 --> 00:14:53,800
 Look, these nominations have all been accepted

471
00:14:53,800 --> 00:14:54,640
 and we'll be duty-consuming.

472
00:14:54,640 --> 00:14:56,200
 - I'm a train Republican.

473
00:14:56,200 --> 00:14:57,040
 (laughing)

474
00:14:57,040 --> 00:14:59,200
 I think we should put all the trains in a shed.

475
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:01,440
 (laughing)

476
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:02,280
 - We should move on quite soon.

477
00:15:02,280 --> 00:15:03,480
 Has anyone got anything else?

478
00:15:03,480 --> 00:15:06,920
 - So in Vienna, also in Austria,

479
00:15:06,920 --> 00:15:10,480
 they had an escalator reopening in 2015

480
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:13,480
 and 14,000 people signed up to turn up

481
00:15:13,480 --> 00:15:16,600
 to this reopening of an escalator.

482
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:19,440
 In the end, a good few hundred people turned up

483
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:21,480
 and the party just got out of hand

484
00:15:21,480 --> 00:15:24,760
 and police had to be called to calm the crowd down.

485
00:15:24,760 --> 00:15:25,600
 - Did someone have to say,

486
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:27,400
 "Well, that escalated quickly."

487
00:15:27,400 --> 00:15:30,000
 (upbeat music)

488
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:36,520
 - Okay, moving on to fact number three and that is--

489
00:15:36,520 --> 00:15:37,880
 - And facts.

490
00:15:37,880 --> 00:15:41,240
 - My fact is that the oil company shell used to sell shells.

491
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:42,960
 (laughing)

492
00:15:42,960 --> 00:15:44,520
 - And it's not a coincidence

493
00:15:44,520 --> 00:15:46,080
 that you know when they're selling the shells

494
00:15:46,080 --> 00:15:47,360
 or the two things related.

495
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:48,880
 - They were different generations.

496
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:51,680
 So Marcus Samuel in 1833 started

497
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:54,800
 had an antiques business and started selling seashells

498
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:56,640
 and then they got very popular.

499
00:15:56,640 --> 00:15:57,640
 So they started having these trading rates

500
00:15:57,640 --> 00:15:59,400
 for import export all over the world

501
00:15:59,400 --> 00:16:02,000
 and then his son Marcus Samuel Jr.

502
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,600
 expanded the business, different goods

503
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:05,440
 and then ended up doing oil.

504
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:07,680
 - Oil is more lucrative than shell selling, isn't it?

505
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:09,600
 I guess they clapped onto that.

506
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:11,520
 - A bit riskier though.

507
00:16:11,520 --> 00:16:13,560
 - Yes. - For the world?

508
00:16:13,560 --> 00:16:14,560
 - Yeah, I think so.

509
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:17,480
 - But also you can't power a massive industrial economy

510
00:16:17,480 --> 00:16:18,560
 just grinding up seashells.

511
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:19,400
 (laughing)

512
00:16:19,400 --> 00:16:20,760
 So I'm glad.

513
00:16:20,760 --> 00:16:23,200
 - Actually seashells used to be used as currency.

514
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:25,520
 Many, many years ago.

515
00:16:25,520 --> 00:16:27,320
 - What, not in Britain?

516
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:29,200
 - No, before Britain existed.

517
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:31,960
 Like I'm talking about thousands of years ago.

518
00:16:31,960 --> 00:16:33,440
 I think they were cowrie shells.

519
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:34,880
 I'm going off memory a bit here

520
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:38,040
 and they were used around Africa I think as currency

521
00:16:38,040 --> 00:16:40,000
 but then they found a new bay

522
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,720
 which had tons and tons and tons of cowrie shells in

523
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:44,960
 and then people just went and collected loads and loads

524
00:16:44,960 --> 00:16:46,920
 of them and ended up completely collapsing

525
00:16:46,920 --> 00:16:48,720
 the very early economy.

526
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:50,360
 - Did you know that shell is revisiting

527
00:16:50,360 --> 00:16:52,120
 at shell based routes?

528
00:16:52,120 --> 00:16:52,960
 - Really?

529
00:16:52,960 --> 00:16:57,400
 - In that they are helping to return shells

530
00:16:57,400 --> 00:16:58,960
 to their natural environment.

531
00:16:58,960 --> 00:17:01,800
 So they're sponsoring this nonprofit organization

532
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:04,240
 which collects shells from restaurants

533
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:06,360
 and then puts them back on beaches and in areas

534
00:17:06,360 --> 00:17:07,640
 where oysters can cling onto them

535
00:17:07,640 --> 00:17:08,960
 'cause apparently oysters like to cling

536
00:17:08,960 --> 00:17:10,440
 onto other oyster shells.

537
00:17:10,440 --> 00:17:11,600
 So there you go.

538
00:17:11,600 --> 00:17:13,520
 They're collecting shells again.

539
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:14,920
 - So I was really impressed with this fact

540
00:17:14,920 --> 00:17:15,880
 and I thought it was brilliant.

541
00:17:15,880 --> 00:17:17,560
 My husband already knew it

542
00:17:17,560 --> 00:17:22,040
 because there is a cart file song from the 30s about shell.

543
00:17:22,040 --> 00:17:22,880
 Did you notice?

544
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:24,680
 - And it's married to a 101 year old man.

545
00:17:24,680 --> 00:17:26,760
 (laughing)

546
00:17:26,760 --> 00:17:28,600
 The whole song is about, in Margate,

547
00:17:28,600 --> 00:17:30,920
 there was a promenade and a man was selling shells

548
00:17:30,920 --> 00:17:32,920
 and his song comes along and turns the business around

549
00:17:32,920 --> 00:17:34,560
 and ends up being this big thing

550
00:17:34,560 --> 00:17:36,920
 about how it's a complex come out of oil

551
00:17:36,920 --> 00:17:38,840
 in the United League of Nations.

552
00:17:38,840 --> 00:17:39,680
 - From the 1930s.

553
00:17:39,680 --> 00:17:40,520
 - Wow. - That's kind of cool.

554
00:17:40,520 --> 00:17:42,200
 - He used to write songs about very different things

555
00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:43,040
 in the '30s.

556
00:17:43,040 --> 00:17:44,480
 (laughing)

557
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:49,400
 - The first ever oil company was founded to harvest

558
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:51,880
 just oil that was floating on water.

559
00:17:51,880 --> 00:17:53,800
 'Cause that was the first people knew about,

560
00:17:53,800 --> 00:17:55,000
 obviously you don't know oil in the ground.

561
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:56,160
 - You said it. - Yeah.

562
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:57,400
 - Yeah, so they sort of saw it.

563
00:17:57,400 --> 00:17:59,400
 It was in Pennsylvania in 1859

564
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:02,760
 and they said, oh, maybe there's more oil underneath here

565
00:18:02,760 --> 00:18:04,880
 and they started drilling down and they struck oil.

566
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:08,760
 But I think that was the first time that oil was actually struck.

567
00:18:08,760 --> 00:18:10,480
 - You know that just speaking of oil floating

568
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:14,720
 on water, so bitumen is like, it's more solid oil.

569
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:17,040
 It's made of the same stuff, but it's like more compressed.

570
00:18:17,040 --> 00:18:20,040
 And so I think the first ever oil kingdom

571
00:18:20,040 --> 00:18:22,760
 that made its money from oil was the Nabatians

572
00:18:22,760 --> 00:18:23,600
 who I love.

573
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:25,600
 I'm never researching them for the end series.

574
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:26,920
 So in the four days.

575
00:18:26,920 --> 00:18:29,120
 - You were always trying to shoe on the Nabatians.

576
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:31,760
 In fact, Anna was actually sure for Ann Nabatians.

577
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:34,080
 (laughing)

578
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:35,880
 - I'm even older than Ann Sonsland.

579
00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:37,880
 (laughing)

580
00:18:37,880 --> 00:18:39,080
 - No, this is incredible.

581
00:18:39,080 --> 00:18:41,440
 They made their money 'cause they were near the Dead Sea

582
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:43,480
 that so they base their kingdom around the Dead Sea.

583
00:18:43,480 --> 00:18:45,920
 And they noticed these lumps of bitumen floating

584
00:18:45,920 --> 00:18:48,240
 in the Dead Sea and they were islands of tar

585
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:50,400
 and the Egyptians liked to buy tar

586
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:53,120
 because they were used in the mummifying process

587
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:54,600
 for embalming and they were also used

588
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:56,000
 for waterproofing boats.

589
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,360
 And so the Nabatians went and swam out to these islands

590
00:18:58,360 --> 00:19:01,160
 on the Dead Sea, easy to swim in it, 'cause you're flown.

591
00:19:01,160 --> 00:19:03,600
 And they collected this bitumen, sold it to the Egyptians

592
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:04,760
 and that's how they got so rich

593
00:19:04,760 --> 00:19:07,400
 and that's how they had the biggest kingdom of that time.

594
00:19:07,400 --> 00:19:08,240
 - That is great.

595
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:09,080
 - That's cool.

596
00:19:09,080 --> 00:19:10,080
 - That's really good.

597
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:11,160
 - Love the Nabatians.

598
00:19:11,160 --> 00:19:12,320
 (laughing)

599
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:14,440
 - Do you know someone who wrote about seashells

600
00:19:14,440 --> 00:19:16,440
 was Edgar Allan Poe, did he?

601
00:19:16,440 --> 00:19:20,560
 He wrote a book called The Conscientogist's First Book

602
00:19:20,560 --> 00:19:22,200
 and it was his best-selling book.

603
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:23,040
 - Is it?

604
00:19:23,040 --> 00:19:24,960
 - Yes, and also he didn't write it really.

605
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:28,120
 The original author said, can you rewrite this

606
00:19:28,120 --> 00:19:30,160
 and sort of remix it in a cheaper way?

607
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:33,960
 But like don't tell the publishers that you're doing this

608
00:19:33,960 --> 00:19:35,960
 'cause the publishers didn't want the author to do this

609
00:19:35,960 --> 00:19:37,880
 but the author wanted to make extra money.

610
00:19:37,880 --> 00:19:40,840
 - Like a spark notes version of the original book.

611
00:19:40,840 --> 00:19:44,320
 So Poe needed the money, so he re-ordered the picture.

612
00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:46,080
 He wrote a preface.

613
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:48,400
 One of his biographers, Jeffrey Mayer's, said,

614
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:51,000
 "Pose boring, pedantic and hair-splitting preface

615
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:54,160
 "was absolutely guaranteed to torment and discourage

616
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:56,600
 "even the most passionately interested schoolboy."

617
00:19:56,600 --> 00:19:58,560
 (laughing)

618
00:19:58,560 --> 00:20:01,080
 - Do you know when the best time to buy petrol is?

619
00:20:01,080 --> 00:20:03,280
 - When your car is like 50% at least.

620
00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:05,880
 (laughing)

621
00:20:05,880 --> 00:20:10,240
 - It's the winter, actually, because petrol gets more dense

622
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:13,640
 when it's colder, and so that means you get more for your money.

623
00:20:13,640 --> 00:20:15,320
 So if you make sure you go and buy a capetra

624
00:20:15,320 --> 00:20:17,440
 on a cold day, then more of it's gonna come out.

625
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:18,280
 - Like how?

626
00:20:18,280 --> 00:20:19,520
 - 'Cause it's measured by volume.

627
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:20,800
 - Like how metal expands when it's hot

628
00:20:20,800 --> 00:20:22,240
 so bridges change in length.

629
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:23,080
 - Yeah.

630
00:20:23,080 --> 00:20:24,400
 - You get a different volume of petrol.

631
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:26,040
 - Bridges don't expand that much in length.

632
00:20:26,040 --> 00:20:26,880
 - It's a bit.

633
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:28,120
 - Oh, we've been on this bridge for ages.

634
00:20:28,120 --> 00:20:28,960
 (laughing)

635
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:30,000
 Well, it's a very warm day.

636
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:31,760
 (laughing)

637
00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:33,720
 - earliest oil drilling platform.

638
00:20:33,720 --> 00:20:35,000
 Do you guys know when it was?

639
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,720
 Was it the Nabatians again?

640
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:37,560
 (laughing)

641
00:20:37,560 --> 00:20:39,840
 - That was collecting, not drilling.

642
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:41,960
 It was not, it was Chinese, obviously,

643
00:20:41,960 --> 00:20:43,720
 as all great inventions seem to be.

644
00:20:43,720 --> 00:20:45,920
 This is the third century BC,

645
00:20:45,920 --> 00:20:48,920
 and they drilled down 800 feet for oil,

646
00:20:48,920 --> 00:20:52,200
 and they siphoned it up through bamboo poles.

647
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:54,720
 And the reason they did it was because salt was very valuable,

648
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:56,960
 and they used oil to create fuel,

649
00:20:56,960 --> 00:21:00,640
 to create heat, to evaporate brine, so they're left salt.

650
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:03,760
 And they had oil pipelines underground made of bamboo.

651
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:06,400
 They were led from one like salt well to another.

652
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:07,240
 - Come off it.

653
00:21:07,240 --> 00:21:08,440
 - Isn't that incredible?

654
00:21:08,440 --> 00:21:10,040
 - Bamboo pipelines.

655
00:21:10,040 --> 00:21:11,200
 - Apparently.

656
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:12,040
 - It does not compute.

657
00:21:12,040 --> 00:21:13,200
 - It was in a real book,

658
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:14,920
 and I'll look it up again later to check

659
00:21:14,920 --> 00:21:18,560
 that it wasn't crazy facts about oil by Mr. Muppet.

660
00:21:18,560 --> 00:21:19,400
 - Dan Schreiber.

661
00:21:19,400 --> 00:21:20,640
 (laughing)

662
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:24,360
 So if you defecated at 650 degrees Fahrenheit

663
00:21:24,360 --> 00:21:27,360
 with a pressure of 3,000 pounds per square inch,

664
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:28,480
 - It would burn.

665
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:31,080
 - It would, and your poo would turn into oil.

666
00:21:31,080 --> 00:21:33,680
 So oil is made through organic material

667
00:21:33,680 --> 00:21:35,200
 which is pressurized,

668
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:37,920
 and that would give you the same effect by doing that.

669
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:40,120
 We've all had curries like that, haven't we?

670
00:21:40,120 --> 00:21:42,080
 - It doesn't mean we could take everyone's poo,

671
00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:43,080
 because it would be horrible,

672
00:21:43,080 --> 00:21:44,240
 but if someone collected everyone's poo

673
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:46,600
 is going to put them in a hot, pressurized room.

674
00:21:46,600 --> 00:21:47,440
 - Yes.

675
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:48,760
 - So why don't we do that?

676
00:21:48,760 --> 00:21:50,600
 - Well, the reason being that the energy

677
00:21:50,600 --> 00:21:52,520
 that you would need to create these conditions

678
00:21:52,520 --> 00:21:55,920
 is a lot more than the energy you would get from oil.

679
00:21:55,920 --> 00:21:58,080
 - It was a thermodynamics.

680
00:21:58,080 --> 00:22:00,600
 - It's called hydrothermal liquid faction,

681
00:22:00,600 --> 00:22:02,640
 and it's a report by the Pacific Northwest

682
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:05,320
 National Laboratory, where they...

683
00:22:05,320 --> 00:22:07,200
 - Did they say the defecation thing?

684
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:08,840
 - That was that of the Harkin Spin.

685
00:22:08,840 --> 00:22:11,640
 - That is, yeah, that is a Harkin Spin.

686
00:22:11,640 --> 00:22:15,640
 But they said if you put feces under these conditions,

687
00:22:15,640 --> 00:22:17,560
 that would happen through a pipeline.

688
00:22:17,560 --> 00:22:21,480
 And what is pooing apart from feces going through a pipeline?

689
00:22:21,480 --> 00:22:22,840
 - That's true.

690
00:22:22,840 --> 00:22:24,880
 - We should move on to him,

691
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:25,960
 but has anyone got anything else?

692
00:22:25,960 --> 00:22:28,000
 - Oh, I was looking at other businesses

693
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:29,440
 that originally saw different things,

694
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:31,040
 and my favourite, which kind of makes sense

695
00:22:31,040 --> 00:22:32,040
 to me when you think about the name,

696
00:22:32,040 --> 00:22:35,280
 is American Express, do you know what they might have done first?

697
00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:36,720
 - Travel or transport?

698
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:38,080
 - Sort of, so post.

699
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:39,600
 They were, because in those days,

700
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:41,720
 so they were founded in 1850,

701
00:22:41,720 --> 00:22:44,720
 and the post, US Postal Zeros was sort of not

702
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:45,800
 as, as it is today,

703
00:22:45,800 --> 00:22:49,200
 and you could only post things as big as a regular letter size envelope.

704
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:51,360
 And so anything bigger, you'd go through an express company,

705
00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:52,840
 so sort of horse guys on horseback,

706
00:22:52,840 --> 00:22:55,480
 and so on and forth from a transport that was around there.

707
00:22:55,480 --> 00:22:56,640
 - Like the pony express.

708
00:22:56,640 --> 00:22:58,000
 - Yeah, and they would just take things.

709
00:22:58,000 --> 00:22:59,840
 And American Express found out

710
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:01,040
 that they did a lot of business for banks

711
00:23:01,040 --> 00:23:03,440
 and carrying things like stocks, certificates, and currency

712
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:05,680
 was a lot more lucrative than carrying big bulky things,

713
00:23:05,680 --> 00:23:07,640
 and so they specialised and made their own products.

714
00:23:07,640 --> 00:23:08,480
 - Oh, that was really cool.

715
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:10,120
 - Because American Express, it makes sense.

716
00:23:10,120 --> 00:23:10,960
 - Yeah.

717
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:13,080
 - And my other favourite one is still the same product,

718
00:23:13,080 --> 00:23:15,080
 but the guys who invented YouTube thought it was going to be

719
00:23:15,080 --> 00:23:17,320
 a dating site to people that upload videos,

720
00:23:17,320 --> 00:23:18,240
 like for what they were looking for,

721
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:19,640
 and you see what they were like.

722
00:23:19,640 --> 00:23:22,040
 - And then it turned out, no one is very camera friendly.

723
00:23:22,040 --> 00:23:24,240
 - And we all like cats, but not in that way.

724
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:25,400
 - Yeah.

725
00:23:25,400 --> 00:23:28,000
 (upbeat music)

726
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:31,160
 (upbeat music)

727
00:23:31,160 --> 00:23:33,400
 - Okay, we should move on to our final fact.

728
00:23:33,400 --> 00:23:36,160
 And that is my fact, which is that when Mozart first performed

729
00:23:36,160 --> 00:23:39,520
 in Naples, he had to stop to take his ring off halfway through

730
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:42,200
 'cause the audience complained it was a magic ring.

731
00:23:42,200 --> 00:23:43,200
 (laughing)

732
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:45,680
 - A magic ring through which he was producing oil.

733
00:23:45,680 --> 00:23:48,320
 - Oh, yeah, that's 650 predators.

734
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:49,160
 - Oh dear.

735
00:23:49,160 --> 00:23:51,120
 (laughing)

736
00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:53,000
 - That's disgusting, but it wasn't that kind of ring

737
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:53,840
 they were referring to.

738
00:23:53,840 --> 00:23:55,200
 - But Mozart would have liked that, wouldn't he?

739
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:57,520
 'Cause he had a dirty mind.

740
00:23:57,520 --> 00:23:59,440
 - Yeah, he had a sense of humor.

741
00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:01,200
 - He was right about his fights and things.

742
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:04,440
 - He was obsessively scatological actually, wasn't it?

743
00:24:04,440 --> 00:24:06,480
 And I think people have really tried to analyze this

744
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:10,360
 and work out why, but he, so he wrote to his cousin

745
00:24:10,360 --> 00:24:13,560
 quite rude letters very often, and one of them, for instance,

746
00:24:13,560 --> 00:24:15,320
 was, "Well, I wish you good night.

747
00:24:15,320 --> 00:24:17,920
 "This is a swear warning for any listeners."

748
00:24:17,920 --> 00:24:19,080
 He said, "Well, I wish you good night,

749
00:24:19,080 --> 00:24:21,520
 "but first, shit in your bed and make it burst.

750
00:24:21,520 --> 00:24:23,080
 "Sleep soundly, my love.

751
00:24:23,080 --> 00:24:25,560
 "Into your mouth, your ass, your shove."

752
00:24:25,560 --> 00:24:26,400
 - What?

753
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:27,640
 - And then he wrote another one saying,

754
00:24:27,640 --> 00:24:30,240
 "I pull on your nose so it runs down your chin."

755
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:31,560
 (groaning)

756
00:24:31,560 --> 00:24:32,720
 (laughing)

757
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:35,200
 - He also wrote a lot of really good stuff, guys.

758
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:36,040
 (laughing)

759
00:24:36,040 --> 00:24:37,040
 - Like some of the good stuff.

760
00:24:37,040 --> 00:24:37,880
 - Yeah.

761
00:24:37,880 --> 00:24:39,240
 - He wrote enough music that it would take you

762
00:24:39,240 --> 00:24:41,720
 two hundred and two hours to listen to all of it.

763
00:24:41,720 --> 00:24:42,560
 - Wow.

764
00:24:42,560 --> 00:24:43,400
 - It's pretty cool.

765
00:24:43,400 --> 00:24:44,400
 - I think they might.

766
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:45,600
 This brings above classic FM.

767
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:46,960
 I think they might have just released

768
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:49,880
 the complete Mozart 200 hours.

769
00:24:49,880 --> 00:24:50,720
 - Two hundred and two.

770
00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:52,440
 - Two hundred, maybe they skipped off the last two.

771
00:24:52,440 --> 00:24:54,320
 That was all the poo stuff.

772
00:24:54,320 --> 00:24:56,640
 - Yeah, it was the best-selling CD of last year, wasn't it?

773
00:24:56,640 --> 00:24:57,480
 Or more CDs?

774
00:24:57,480 --> 00:25:00,800
 More Mozart CDs were sold than any other artist last year.

775
00:25:00,800 --> 00:25:03,040
 - Mozart loved poo.

776
00:25:03,040 --> 00:25:03,880
 - Yeah.

777
00:25:03,880 --> 00:25:06,320
 - It's possible that poo loves Mozart.

778
00:25:06,320 --> 00:25:09,720
 There is a sewage treatment plant in Switzerland.

779
00:25:09,720 --> 00:25:13,920
 And in 2010, they started playing Mozart to the waist.

780
00:25:13,920 --> 00:25:14,760
 - No.

781
00:25:14,760 --> 00:25:15,600
 - Yes.

782
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:16,440
 - No.

783
00:25:16,440 --> 00:25:17,280
 - And what?

784
00:25:17,280 --> 00:25:18,640
 - I don't know if he's seen Flava.

785
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:20,200
 (laughing)

786
00:25:20,200 --> 00:25:22,360
 - They claimed that the music's vibrations

787
00:25:22,360 --> 00:25:24,640
 would help the organisms, the microbes in it,

788
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:27,240
 to break down the waist and the cadences

789
00:25:27,240 --> 00:25:28,080
 and all of these things.

790
00:25:28,080 --> 00:25:29,360
 So they developed a process to play it.

791
00:25:29,360 --> 00:25:32,200
 And the man who ran the place is a guy called Anton Stuckey.

792
00:25:32,200 --> 00:25:34,480
 And he said he wasn't actually a fan of Mozart.

793
00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:35,880
 They had to convince him quite strongly

794
00:25:35,880 --> 00:25:37,040
 that it would work to do it.

795
00:25:37,040 --> 00:25:39,400
 I don't know if they're still doing it, but they did start.

796
00:25:39,400 --> 00:25:44,400
 - Interestingly, if you take human eggs in IVF,

797
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:49,240
 they grow better if you play techno music to them.

798
00:25:49,240 --> 00:25:50,080
 - Really?

799
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:52,400
 - Last week in some study or other.

800
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:53,240
 - Wow.

801
00:25:53,240 --> 00:25:55,240
 - So is this vibration we're thinking?

802
00:25:55,240 --> 00:25:56,080
 - Yeah.

803
00:25:56,080 --> 00:25:56,920
 - That's vibration, yeah.

804
00:25:56,920 --> 00:25:58,520
 - I'm just really like to have an adjective explain my fact

805
00:25:58,520 --> 00:26:00,440
 'cause you all derailed me with your scatological--

806
00:26:00,440 --> 00:26:02,000
 - Sorry, magic ring, yeah.

807
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:03,520
 - Magic ring.

808
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:05,960
 So he was doing this concert in Naples.

809
00:26:05,960 --> 00:26:09,680
 He was 14 years old and it was in 1770.

810
00:26:09,680 --> 00:26:11,560
 And at rumour been spreading anywhere

811
00:26:11,560 --> 00:26:13,240
 that he was using magic powers to play.

812
00:26:13,240 --> 00:26:15,320
 That the audience refused to be entertained.

813
00:26:15,320 --> 00:26:18,400
 So they refused to applaud and they just didn't see it

814
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:20,240
 as impressive 'cause they assumed his power was coming

815
00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:21,200
 from this magic ring.

816
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:22,520
 So halfway through his performance,

817
00:26:22,520 --> 00:26:24,200
 he had to stop and take off his ring.

818
00:26:24,200 --> 00:26:26,520
 And at that point, apparently,

819
00:26:26,520 --> 00:26:28,720
 the audience gassed in astonishment and fear

820
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:30,760
 while crossing themselves.

821
00:26:30,760 --> 00:26:35,440
 - I went onto the Wikipedia for magic rings, there is one.

822
00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:38,760
 And it starts off, a magic ring is a ring,

823
00:26:38,760 --> 00:26:40,400
 usually a figure ring.

824
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:43,000
 (laughing)

825
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:45,760
 - I wonder what these magic cock rinks are.

826
00:26:45,760 --> 00:26:46,600
 - Oh my god.

827
00:26:46,600 --> 00:26:47,480
 - It's a toe ring, James.

828
00:26:47,480 --> 00:26:48,320
 - I don't know about toe rings.

829
00:26:48,320 --> 00:26:50,560
 - Toe ring, or earring, it could be, I guess.

830
00:26:50,560 --> 00:26:52,160
 - No, the way my mind went that.

831
00:26:52,160 --> 00:26:53,400
 (laughing)

832
00:26:53,400 --> 00:26:56,560
 - Yeah, magic ring is a ring, usually a figure ring

833
00:26:56,560 --> 00:26:58,360
 that has magical properties.

834
00:26:58,360 --> 00:26:59,200
 - Great.

835
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:00,520
 - Makes a lot of sense.

836
00:27:00,520 --> 00:27:02,800
 I should say I found this fact in a book called

837
00:27:02,800 --> 00:27:05,440
 Time Keepers by Simon Garfield and it's amazing.

838
00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:06,760
 And you should buy it, I'm loving it.

839
00:27:06,760 --> 00:27:08,280
 I'm about quarter of the way through.

840
00:27:08,280 --> 00:27:10,000
 He's brilliant.

841
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:12,240
 - So I didn't know, I knew most of it was a child prodigy.

842
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:14,680
 I didn't know quite how much of one he was.

843
00:27:14,680 --> 00:27:16,680
 So he could play the harp in the violin

844
00:27:16,680 --> 00:27:18,840
 at the edge of about three, or he started playing that.

845
00:27:18,840 --> 00:27:20,720
 When he was five, he was quite good.

846
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:22,760
 And then his father took him on tour, age six,

847
00:27:22,760 --> 00:27:26,320
 for three and a half years, playing across Europe.

848
00:27:26,320 --> 00:27:29,720
 And with his sister as well, who doesn't get as much credit.

849
00:27:29,720 --> 00:27:30,720
 - Was his sister better?

850
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:33,200
 I read somewhere that his sister was a better musician.

851
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:34,040
 - I don't think so.

852
00:27:34,040 --> 00:27:35,480
 - I start off with, 'cause she was older.

853
00:27:35,480 --> 00:27:38,960
 - I think, didn't she trans, 'cause he would play,

854
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:40,040
 I think she would transcribe.

855
00:27:40,040 --> 00:27:41,880
 And there's some thought that she had more influence

856
00:27:41,880 --> 00:27:43,280
 since he was given credit for.

857
00:27:43,280 --> 00:27:44,520
 - Interesting.

858
00:27:44,520 --> 00:27:46,440
 - Yeah, and he could, I read this.

859
00:27:46,440 --> 00:27:47,800
 I can't, I don't know if I believe it.

860
00:27:47,800 --> 00:27:49,840
 He could write music before you could write words.

861
00:27:49,840 --> 00:27:51,160
 - You can sort of believe it.

862
00:27:51,160 --> 00:27:53,480
 - It's easier to write blobs on manuscripts

863
00:27:53,480 --> 00:27:55,000
 than it is to write actual letters.

864
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:56,320
 - Yeah.

865
00:27:56,320 --> 00:27:58,720
 - It is very interesting psychologically,

866
00:27:58,720 --> 00:28:01,440
 because he is the original child prodigy.

867
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:03,320
 And you've got to wonder what effects it had.

868
00:28:03,320 --> 00:28:05,920
 So when I was listening to, I used this podcast

869
00:28:05,920 --> 00:28:08,480
 as an excuse to listen to my genuinely favourite podcast,

870
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:11,040
 which is the Radio 3 composer of the week podcast.

871
00:28:11,040 --> 00:28:11,880
 - Second, second.

872
00:28:11,880 --> 00:28:13,240
 - It's the genuinely favourite podcast.

873
00:28:13,240 --> 00:28:14,800
 - Second favourite.

874
00:28:14,800 --> 00:28:16,120
 - Radio allows my favourite.

875
00:28:16,120 --> 00:28:19,040
 (all laughing)

876
00:28:19,040 --> 00:28:22,280
 And yeah, he was, and people were amazed at him.

877
00:28:22,280 --> 00:28:23,640
 And it must have affected him hugely.

878
00:28:23,640 --> 00:28:26,560
 And apparently, when he got older, he was very angry

879
00:28:26,560 --> 00:28:28,400
 that people didn't treat him with the same kind of

880
00:28:28,400 --> 00:28:30,760
 amazement and deference, 'cause once he was a grown-up,

881
00:28:30,760 --> 00:28:33,880
 he was just an incredibly talented musician and composer.

882
00:28:33,880 --> 00:28:37,080
 But as a child, he was like this magic genius.

883
00:28:37,080 --> 00:28:38,200
 So he used to get very annoyed.

884
00:28:38,200 --> 00:28:39,200
 - But it's really rough.

885
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:41,440
 - Because he will be a better player than he was

886
00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:43,040
 and he was a kid, but rather than be admired

887
00:28:43,040 --> 00:28:44,840
 for being better at more skilled.

888
00:28:44,840 --> 00:28:46,080
 - Oh, everyone's gone, oh, you're not cute.

889
00:28:46,080 --> 00:28:46,920
 - Yeah.

890
00:28:46,920 --> 00:28:49,000
 - It's like someone who's absolute best year

891
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:51,680
 was the first year of university.

892
00:28:51,680 --> 00:28:56,120
 And they can never quite get back that magic again.

893
00:28:56,120 --> 00:28:57,680
 - That is the story of my life.

894
00:28:57,680 --> 00:28:58,680
 (all laughing)

895
00:28:58,680 --> 00:29:01,840
 - So Mozart's first name was John.

896
00:29:01,840 --> 00:29:06,360
 Johannes, Chrysostom, Wolf Gangus, Theophilus, Mozart.

897
00:29:06,360 --> 00:29:09,520
 And he was named after St. John Chrysostom.

898
00:29:09,520 --> 00:29:13,000
 And I was reading about the story of St. John Chrysostom.

899
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:14,360
 And it's quite good.

900
00:29:14,360 --> 00:29:16,360
 He was living in the desert.

901
00:29:16,360 --> 00:29:18,440
 And then a princess came to his cave

902
00:29:18,440 --> 00:29:20,600
 'cause she was being attacked by animals.

903
00:29:20,600 --> 00:29:22,840
 And he didn't really want her to move into his cave

904
00:29:22,840 --> 00:29:25,280
 because he was worried that he might have sex with her.

905
00:29:25,280 --> 00:29:29,200
 And so what he did was like some kind of 1966 sitcom.

906
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:31,520
 He drew a line in the middle of his cave

907
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:33,320
 and said, "I'll stay on my side of the line

908
00:29:33,320 --> 00:29:35,320
 "and you stay on your side of the line."

909
00:29:35,320 --> 00:29:39,280
 And then despite this, the synophonication was committed.

910
00:29:39,280 --> 00:29:40,280
 - Ah.

911
00:29:40,280 --> 00:29:43,520
 - And in a tent to hide it, he threw her off a cliff.

912
00:29:43,520 --> 00:29:47,720
 - What, I just tell her to keep it quiet with her friends.

913
00:29:47,720 --> 00:29:48,880
 - That's her off a cliff.

914
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:50,160
 - It was a different time.

915
00:29:50,160 --> 00:29:52,680
 - It was a bit of the '70s.

916
00:29:52,680 --> 00:29:53,520
 - '70s. - '70s.

917
00:29:53,520 --> 00:29:54,360
 - '70s.

918
00:29:54,360 --> 00:29:56,760
 (all laughing)

919
00:29:56,760 --> 00:29:59,320
 - Then he went to Rome to beg for absolution,

920
00:29:59,320 --> 00:30:00,960
 which was refused.

921
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:02,600
 - Only for the murderer for the sex.

922
00:30:02,600 --> 00:30:04,000
 - For the murder, really.

923
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:05,560
 - I'd like to be absolved from murder, please,

924
00:30:05,560 --> 00:30:07,040
 but with a sex chaser.

925
00:30:07,040 --> 00:30:09,320
 (all laughing)

926
00:30:09,320 --> 00:30:11,560
 - At the beginning when he said a princess comes into his cave,

927
00:30:11,560 --> 00:30:12,720
 I was thinking, "Oh, it sounds a bit like

928
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:14,320
 "the beginning of Notting Hill."

929
00:30:14,320 --> 00:30:16,600
 (all laughing)

930
00:30:16,600 --> 00:30:18,360
 - 'Cause that's where the celebrity comes

931
00:30:18,360 --> 00:30:20,400
 into Hugh Grant's bookshop in Notting Hill.

932
00:30:20,400 --> 00:30:22,240
 Like a very famous wealthy person

933
00:30:22,240 --> 00:30:23,920
 comes into the life of an ordinary man.

934
00:30:23,920 --> 00:30:25,040
 - I've not seen Notting Hill.

935
00:30:25,040 --> 00:30:26,560
 Does he then throw off a cliff?

936
00:30:26,560 --> 00:30:28,000
 (all laughing)

937
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:33,080
 Anyway, so then he lived like a beast, crawling on all fours

938
00:30:33,080 --> 00:30:35,880
 and feeding on wild grasses and roots.

939
00:30:35,880 --> 00:30:38,880
 And then the princess reappeared alive

940
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:40,640
 with the saint's baby.

941
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:41,480
 - What?

942
00:30:41,480 --> 00:30:42,320
 - Okay.

943
00:30:42,320 --> 00:30:44,840
 - And the baby miraculously pronounced his sins

944
00:30:44,840 --> 00:30:46,000
 to be forgiven.

945
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:48,080
 And that was the miracle that made him into a saint's.

946
00:30:48,080 --> 00:30:49,600
 - Very forgiving of the baby.

947
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:51,320
 - Was she brought back to life by God,

948
00:30:51,320 --> 00:30:53,800
 or was she, did she just survive being thrown off a cliff?

949
00:30:53,800 --> 00:30:55,080
 - We don't see that.

950
00:30:55,080 --> 00:30:56,080
 We don't see that.

951
00:30:56,080 --> 00:30:57,040
 - The haven't asked it off screen.

952
00:30:57,040 --> 00:30:59,600
 - Yeah, you have to infer it from yourself.

953
00:30:59,600 --> 00:31:03,000
 Like it's one of those stories where it could be one

954
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:03,960
 or it could be the other.

955
00:31:03,960 --> 00:31:05,400
 Like the end of inception.

956
00:31:05,400 --> 00:31:07,240
 (all laughing)

957
00:31:07,240 --> 00:31:08,560
 - I thought you could only become a saint

958
00:31:08,560 --> 00:31:10,000
 by doing three amazing things.

959
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:12,040
 I didn't realize you could just get a baby to forgive you.

960
00:31:12,040 --> 00:31:13,440
 - He's done three amazing things.

961
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:15,240
 He's had sex with the princess.

962
00:31:15,240 --> 00:31:16,880
 He's lived like a beast.

963
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:18,080
 (all laughing)

964
00:31:18,080 --> 00:31:19,000
 - And he's been to Rome.

965
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:19,840
 - He's been to Rome.

966
00:31:19,840 --> 00:31:21,880
 - And he's got a talking baby.

967
00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:24,520
 It's basically not in Hill, mixed with inception.

968
00:31:24,520 --> 00:31:25,680
 - Looks like he's talking.

969
00:31:25,680 --> 00:31:27,600
 (all laughing)

970
00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:30,720
 - And that's the story of Mozart.

971
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:32,640
 - Mozart got a lot of bad reviews, interestingly.

972
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:36,320
 Even during life, probably used a magic ring one star.

973
00:31:36,320 --> 00:31:38,000
 (all laughing)

974
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:39,320
 - Fake.

975
00:31:39,320 --> 00:31:40,840
 - And so these were phrases that we used about him.

976
00:31:40,840 --> 00:31:44,720
 Too strongly spiced, impenetrable labyrinths,

977
00:31:44,720 --> 00:31:47,480
 bizarre flights of the soul, and overloaded,

978
00:31:47,480 --> 00:31:48,680
 and overstuffed.

979
00:31:48,680 --> 00:31:49,520
 - Really?

980
00:31:49,520 --> 00:31:52,000
 - Yeah, so it wasn't all completely positive.

981
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:53,800
 I was not saying he was bad at music.

982
00:31:53,800 --> 00:31:55,160
 (all laughing)

983
00:31:55,160 --> 00:31:56,600
 - He was one of the haters.

984
00:31:56,600 --> 00:31:57,720
 - He may have died, this is interesting.

985
00:31:57,720 --> 00:32:00,480
 He may have died because he got too little sunlight.

986
00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:01,320
 - Pretty.

987
00:32:01,320 --> 00:32:02,400
 - Yeah, 'cause he died so young.

988
00:32:02,400 --> 00:32:04,520
 He was 35 when he died.

989
00:32:04,520 --> 00:32:07,600
 And he was very nocturnal towards the end of his life.

990
00:32:07,600 --> 00:32:10,040
 And where he was living, he died about three months

991
00:32:10,040 --> 00:32:11,000
 into the winter.

992
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:13,480
 And there's a theory that a contributory factor

993
00:32:13,480 --> 00:32:17,600
 was lack of vitamin D, 'cause you can't make vitamin D

994
00:32:17,600 --> 00:32:18,880
 if you don't get sunlight.

995
00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:21,520
 So, and there are so many other theories though,

996
00:32:21,520 --> 00:32:24,000
 there are about 20 theories at least of what killed him.

997
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:26,320
 - He was also rejected in other ways,

998
00:32:26,320 --> 00:32:28,400
 so he was rejected in love.

999
00:32:28,400 --> 00:32:30,600
 By the first woman he fell in love with, actually,

1000
00:32:30,600 --> 00:32:34,120
 a loisier Weber, and he ended up marrying her sister,

1001
00:32:34,120 --> 00:32:35,600
 but he fell in love with her at first.

1002
00:32:35,600 --> 00:32:37,720
 And when asked after his death why she'd turned him down,

1003
00:32:37,720 --> 00:32:39,520
 she just said, "I did not know.

1004
00:32:39,520 --> 00:32:41,920
 "I only thought he was such a little man."

1005
00:32:41,920 --> 00:32:43,680
 Rejected 'cause he was too small.

1006
00:32:43,680 --> 00:32:48,840
 And then another person, the print select of Bavaria,

1007
00:32:48,840 --> 00:32:51,640
 once heard him play, and then afterwards said,

1008
00:32:51,640 --> 00:32:53,320
 "Who would believe that such great things

1009
00:32:53,320 --> 00:32:55,640
 "could be hidden in so small a head?"

1010
00:32:55,640 --> 00:32:57,760
 So he obviously had a smallness problem

1011
00:32:57,760 --> 00:32:59,680
 that perhaps he was trying to compensate for.

1012
00:32:59,680 --> 00:33:01,240
 - He must've been hard for him to play music

1013
00:33:01,240 --> 00:33:02,320
 with such small hunts.

1014
00:33:02,320 --> 00:33:06,560
 - And he ran up and down the keys, like big.

1015
00:33:06,560 --> 00:33:08,960
 (all laughing)

1016
00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:10,120
 - Maybe there's anything about him not getting

1017
00:33:10,120 --> 00:33:11,840
 if he was indoors and not getting up with him in D

1018
00:33:11,840 --> 00:33:13,240
 'cause you need that to grow, right?

1019
00:33:13,240 --> 00:33:14,080
 - Yes.

1020
00:33:14,080 --> 00:33:15,080
 - This is a cracking theory.

1021
00:33:15,080 --> 00:33:17,880
 This is the kind of thing that bullshit science studies

1022
00:33:17,880 --> 00:33:20,480
 get written about, was Mozart too small

1023
00:33:20,480 --> 00:33:23,280
 'cause he didn't know enough with him in D?

1024
00:33:23,280 --> 00:33:25,040
 - Okay, we should round up pretty soon.

1025
00:33:25,040 --> 00:33:26,520
 Has anyone got anything else?

1026
00:33:26,520 --> 00:33:28,200
 - Oh, I just have one thing, which I'm not sure is true,

1027
00:33:28,200 --> 00:33:30,480
 but I like it so much I wanted to say.

1028
00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:32,840
 Mozart probably had a fear of trumpets

1029
00:33:32,840 --> 00:33:34,360
 and I read somewhere that to cure him of this,

1030
00:33:34,360 --> 00:33:36,280
 his father hired someone to follow him around

1031
00:33:36,280 --> 00:33:40,040
 with a trumpet and blast the noise and raise him.

1032
00:33:40,040 --> 00:33:43,040
 I don't care if it's not true 'cause I really like that, yeah.

1033
00:33:43,040 --> 00:33:45,840
 I can kind of know what I know about Mozart's father.

1034
00:33:45,840 --> 00:33:47,000
 I can totally imagine that.

1035
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:48,000
 - Yeah, I can totally imagine that.

1036
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:48,840
 - Yeah, I can totally imagine that.

1037
00:33:48,840 --> 00:33:50,000
 - Is he a slave driver?

1038
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:51,160
 - A little bit, I think.

1039
00:33:51,160 --> 00:33:53,000
 - If it is six-year-old on tour for three years.

1040
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:53,840
 - Yeah.

1041
00:33:53,840 --> 00:33:54,840
 (all laughing)

1042
00:33:54,840 --> 00:33:56,800
 - And his son liked him.

1043
00:33:56,800 --> 00:33:58,120
 - Stunned to his grave.

1044
00:33:58,120 --> 00:33:59,120
 (all laughing)

1045
00:33:59,120 --> 00:34:00,280
 - Okay, yeah.

1046
00:34:00,280 --> 00:34:02,640
 - He's deliberately shrunk his own son.

1047
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:03,960
 Like, honey, I shrunk the kids.

1048
00:34:03,960 --> 00:34:05,440
 (all laughing)

1049
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:08,040
 (upbeat music)

1050
00:34:08,040 --> 00:34:15,560
 - Okay, we should have finished on the election and reference.

1051
00:34:15,560 --> 00:34:17,200
 That's all of our facts for this week.

1052
00:34:17,200 --> 00:34:19,000
