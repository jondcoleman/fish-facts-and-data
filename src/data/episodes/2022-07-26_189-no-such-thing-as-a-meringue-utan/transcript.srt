00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,880
 So the episode you're about to hear was recorded at the Cheltenham Literature Festival and every single

2
00:00:04,880 --> 00:00:08,880
 fact in it is from the book. So it will give you a good idea about what you're going to be buying.

3
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:10,720
 It was an awesome gig. Hope you enjoy.

4
00:00:25,720 --> 00:00:31,800
 Hello and welcome to another episode of No Such Thing as a Fish, a weekly podcast this week

5
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:34,440
 coming to you from the Cheltenham Literature Festival.

6
00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:42,200
 My name is Dan Schreiber. I'm sitting here with Anna Chazinski, Andrew Huntamari, and James

7
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:46,200
 Harkin. And once again, we have gathered around the microphones with our four favorite facts

8
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:52,280
 from the last seven days. And in no particular order, here we go. Starting with you, Chazinski.

9
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:59,880
 My fact this week is that this year the phrase "Make America Great Again" adorned half a million hats

10
00:00:59,880 --> 00:01:01,560
 and one a-ness.

11
00:01:01,560 --> 00:01:10,200
 That is legally contentious, as a way of describing the president.

12
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:20,760
 So this is, of course, the MAGA caps. If you weren't living in a cave, the MAGA appeared on lots of

13
00:01:20,760 --> 00:01:29,160
 caps that were sold throughout America, but also LGBTQ performance artist Abel Azcona had himself

14
00:01:29,160 --> 00:01:37,000
 tattooed, stenciled on the bottom, with "Make America Great Again" with the MAGA. And he said it was

15
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:43,320
 an a subversive action. So he said, "The anus is a land of pleasure and a terrarium of empowerment

16
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:48,760
 for many." I didn't know. A terrarium terrarium is very unusual. I thought a terrarium was where

17
00:01:48,760 --> 00:01:55,480
 you kept ants. No, that's a formicarium. A terrarium is where you keep snakes and things like that.

18
00:01:55,480 --> 00:02:00,920
 Oh right, okay. That's much better right. Is it why you keep... Shoddy, it's just a place it's

19
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:06,040
 full of earth. I mean, we already is vexed, it's the point of time.

20
00:02:06,040 --> 00:02:13,240
 So he concluded that writing a fascist political motto like that is what is not mine.

21
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:19,080
 "In my anus" is a clearly critical and subversive action, so that's what's in it. The anus is what you're

22
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:25,000
 saying. Oh god. I think it was... It was a lot to know this, Andy. It was a possibility. It could be

23
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:30,200
 surrounding. Yeah, that's what that was. Yeah, as well. He did say it in, but I think it's on the edge.

24
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:35,320
 Inside? No, come on. You don't write the word polo inside the mint. You write it around the...

25
00:02:35,320 --> 00:02:42,280
 So what's interesting about this guy is that he's done it, but he doesn't regress it. And we

26
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:48,120
 read a story last year about a guy called Joshua who done a similar thing. He was a big fan of Bernie

27
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:53,880
 Sanders, but he did regret his tattoo, which was a tattoo on his penis, which said feel the burn.

28
00:02:53,880 --> 00:02:59,720
 And then he did that in the primaries, and then Hillary got it, and he was like, oh, I have made a

29
00:02:59,720 --> 00:03:05,720
 terrible mistake. This is still 2020, isn't it? That's true. So do you know,

30
00:03:05,720 --> 00:03:12,360
 make America great again was actually Ronald Reagan's campaign slogan? Or his was not exactly the same,

31
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:18,920
 his was let's make America great again. And also his next phrase, he's already worked out what

32
00:03:18,920 --> 00:03:25,880
 it'll be in 2020. Really? Yeah, he's going to go for keep America great exclamation point. That's

33
00:03:25,880 --> 00:03:32,040
 what he says. But unfortunately, that's already taken by a horror movie. It's in purge election

34
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:37,720
 year, which is a movie that came out last year. Wow. So he's not allowed to use it? Well, I think he will

35
00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:45,720
 anyway. Could he put maybe a question mark on the end instead of something? Yeah. He did really

36
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:50,040
 specifically say the exclamation point when they asked him about it. Did he? Well, he said the words

37
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:55,480
 exclamation point, or he just said it like he says stuff. I mean, it's such, three years is such a long

38
00:03:55,480 --> 00:04:00,200
 time in politics, isn't it? I think we can, you know, we don't know if that'll be the slogan. He

39
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:04,120
 might change it to something realistic, like let us fight the cockroaches among the Radio Act.

40
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:15,160
 He did get, he got in another legal copyright dispute. I mean, he has a lot of lawsuits all the time,

41
00:04:15,160 --> 00:04:21,800
 but there was one lawsuit that Trump got involved in, which was over an app for the iPhone,

42
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:29,640
 and the app was called iTrump, okay? So it was, and it was against a trumpet teacher, an

43
00:04:29,640 --> 00:04:34,680
 amateur musician. He's a 40-year-old guy called Thomas Schaffeld, and they had this, I think,

44
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:39,640
 a six-year legal battle where Schaffeld represented himself in court against all of Trump's lawyers,

45
00:04:39,640 --> 00:04:44,840
 and he won. So the eye Trump now belongs to this trumpet guy. Awesome. Yeah. Have you ever heard of

46
00:04:44,840 --> 00:04:49,480
 Eddie Trump? No. I don't know how to describe this guy, but so there's this Per Brothers, real estate

47
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:56,200
 developers called the Trump Brothers. One of them's Eddie Trump in 2013 ABC News had a list of the

48
00:04:56,200 --> 00:05:02,440
 top 50 most influential ultra-high net worth individuals. There was one Trump on it. It was Eddie

49
00:05:02,440 --> 00:05:09,240
 Trump bizarrely, but in the 1980s, they had this real estate company, and Donald Trump found out

50
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:13,480
 about it when he received a letter accidentally sent to him, which was meant for Eddie Trump,

51
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:18,840
 and so he spent the next many years trying to sue them for using the Trump name, his own name

52
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:23,000
 on their business, despite them being called the Trumps. And he lost that case, but that's amazing.

53
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:28,200
 Simmer. One of my favorite Trump stories from this year, and it's made it into the book

54
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:34,520
 under the title "Protests, Non-Dirty," because we have a dirty protest section.

55
00:05:34,520 --> 00:05:42,280
 Is that a US cabinet member, who's Wilbur Ross, praised Donald Trump's trip to Saudi Arabia,

56
00:05:42,280 --> 00:05:47,720
 saying it was so successful that there wasn't a single protestor failing to recognize that

57
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:53,400
 protesting is illegal in Saudi Arabia. And he was on a TV show talking about it,

58
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:57,960
 saying it was fascinating. There was not one bad guy with a bad placard standing there doing

59
00:05:57,960 --> 00:06:02,040
 anything, and when the reporter said, "Yeah, but that's because he would go to jail for up to 15

60
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:06,680
 years if he was standing doing that." In theory, that could be true. Yeah, yeah. But really,

61
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:12,280
 it was amazing. Just no one was there. Well, he's not had the best time abroad,

62
00:06:12,280 --> 00:06:17,560
 has he Trump. He went to the G20, and he was sat next to it one of the dinners, the first lady

63
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:22,360
 of Japan. And he said it was quite tough to sit next to her because she didn't speak any English.

64
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:26,920
 The problem is, if you go on the internet, you can look at videos of her and she speaks perfect English.

65
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:37,400
 So just completely affected. Amazing. There was one line of his, which I think encapsulated a lot

66
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:45,000
 of the whole presidency so far. This was something that Dan found. He said, he was interviewed and he said,

67
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:50,760
 "I think we've had the most successful 13 weeks in the history of the presidency." Unfortunately,

68
00:06:50,760 --> 00:06:59,000
 he said that only 11 weeks into his presidency. Actually, we wrote an article in the book on the

69
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:03,240
 inauguration, and we did it in numbers because that was obviously the big thing where he said,

70
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:09,640
 "Biggest inauguration ever, period." And Andy did this whole article about the many little numbers

71
00:07:09,640 --> 00:07:14,120
 that didn't get reported. Do you have any examples? Yes. Oh, what was this? So the crowd was meant

72
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:19,320
 to be 1.5 million, and actually it was worked out at three to six hundred thousand, which is still

73
00:07:19,320 --> 00:07:24,520
 a lot of people. What, you mean three hundred thousand to six hundred thousand? Sorry, I don't mean

74
00:07:24,520 --> 00:07:32,360
 minimum three maximum six hundred thousand. What else was there? There were, oh, things,

75
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:37,800
 the number of cans of ravioli. Ravioli that were confiscated by security for being a potential

76
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:43,560
 risk to presidential security, which that was two. What was the thing about Don's John's?

77
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:49,320
 Oh, yeah, all the, all the porters for the crowds who turned up were brought by a company, which is

78
00:07:49,320 --> 00:07:55,320
 genuinely called Don's John's, and they feared that people might make jokes about this, so they covered

79
00:07:55,320 --> 00:08:00,360
 all the labels up with blue tape on the day. So it's got a thin skinned ring. And they also confiscated

80
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:07,000
 from people coming into the inauguration bananas. So if you had a banana, it wasn't allowed in unless

81
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:11,800
 it was sliced. So they would say, "May I see your lunchbox?" I'm sorry, that bananas in full form.

82
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:18,680
 So another thing that Trump said that people, according to question this year, was that he invented

83
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:24,920
 the phrase priming the pump. Do people remember that? So he used the phrase priming the pump, and then he

84
00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:29,480
 said, have you heard that expression before because I haven't heard it? I mean, I just made it up a

85
00:08:29,480 --> 00:08:34,600
 couple of days ago. That's just the kind of thing I have to do. And of course, he didn't make it up,

86
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:41,160
 it dates back to 1819, I think, in a Walter Scott story, which then I ended up reading in preparation

87
00:08:41,160 --> 00:08:46,600
 for this. It's great, but Walter Scott's actually talking about a woman who comes up to him at a party

88
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:51,720
 and says to him, "I really loved your latest book, but he'd written it under a pseudonym." So she was

89
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:56,120
 actually bragging to him and saying, "Haha, I've got you. I know it's you." And so he's talking about

90
00:08:56,120 --> 00:09:00,680
 how annoyed he is that she's trying to prime the pump with flattery. But yeah, he also

91
00:09:00,680 --> 00:09:06,360
 claimed this week, I think, or last week, to have invented fake news. I think I'd give him that.

92
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:12,680
 No, it was even just the word fake because he didn't get to news. So I think he did meet

93
00:09:12,680 --> 00:09:17,000
 mean fake news, but he's sitting next to Pence in it, and that's the best bit because he says,

94
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:20,760
 "No, many people know. I invented the word fake." And Pence is like, "Yeah, he did."

95
00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:27,160
 He's such a good best friend. He's so good. It's not done him too much harm. So, for example,

96
00:09:27,160 --> 00:09:34,120
 since the election, at least two babies in Iraq have been named Trump. So he's got that.

97
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:38,680
 That's a take away. They're going to go through life answering questions about that.

98
00:09:38,680 --> 00:09:44,680
 Well, here's an interesting thing. I went to Kosovo quite a few years ago, and I was told while I was

99
00:09:44,680 --> 00:09:49,480
 out there that a popular name that was happening amongst boys in Kosovo, new names,

100
00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:57,400
 was Tonneblur, T-O-N-B-L-R, and it's a tribute to Tony Blair because of the, I think there's a Bill

101
00:09:57,400 --> 00:10:03,960
 Clinton, Bill of Adela, Christina. There's Clinton up on buildings everywhere you went. There was

102
00:10:03,960 --> 00:10:09,400
 pictures of Clinton, and Tonneblur is a name in Kosovo now. But the problem is with Donald is

103
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:13,640
 no one's been called Donald anymore. Oh, that's true. I think there were only something like two

104
00:10:13,640 --> 00:10:21,320
 babies called Donald in Scotland, even last year. Even in Scotland? No, it's the home of Donald.

105
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:26,040
 It's the home of the Donald. Because it's in Scotland, where can you? And apparently they did an

106
00:10:26,040 --> 00:10:29,960
 interview with a guy who was called Donald, and he said he had to apologise every time he went to

107
00:10:29,960 --> 00:10:37,960
 Starbucks. But that's because he took a poo on the account. Why did he apologise? Because they say

108
00:10:37,960 --> 00:10:44,120
 what's your name? And he goes, "Donald, sorry." And so he's saying about Scotland, Donald Trump has

109
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:50,120
 some golf courses in Scotland. And for one of those, he wanted to have a crest for his family.

110
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:56,360
 So what he did was he took an English crest and stole it and put the word "Trump" at the bottom

111
00:10:56,360 --> 00:10:59,480
 in place of the word that was there before that, which was integrity.

112
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:07,880
 We're going to have to move on to our second fact, because we're running on a tighter podcast schedule

113
00:11:07,880 --> 00:11:13,080
 tonight. So we're going to move on to our second fact now, and that is James. Okay, my fact this

114
00:11:13,080 --> 00:11:19,960
 week is that East Enderstar Adam Woodjatt was beaten in the London marathon this year by a man

115
00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:26,360
 in a sleeping bag, a woman in a full-body dinosaur suit, and a man carrying a tumble dryer.

116
00:11:30,520 --> 00:11:37,320
 So he did the course in seven hours and four minutes, which is... Is that slow? It's quite slow, yeah.

117
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:40,680
 Okay. They reckon one of the reasons might have been because he was doing so many selfies on the way.

118
00:11:40,680 --> 00:11:46,520
 Okay. But yeah, there were 73 world records attempted at this year's London marathon,

119
00:11:46,520 --> 00:11:53,880
 and 39 were broken. So this sleeping bag was broken, the dinosaur was broken. The fastest marathon

120
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:59,960
 ever run by someone dressed as a witch was broken. That was by Nicola Nothol from Pendle,

121
00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:05,880
 and she thought she'd broken the record last year, but they nullified her results because her skirt

122
00:12:05,880 --> 00:12:11,080
 was too short. Oh, yeah. Apparently witches have to have a certain length of skirt.

123
00:12:11,080 --> 00:12:15,160
 Did not know that, yeah. How sure was Adam Woodjatt's skirt.

124
00:12:15,160 --> 00:12:22,200
 He's, I bet, I mean, are there any East Ender's fans in here except me? No, wow, not a single one.

125
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:26,040
 No overlap between shot and the cherry festival, and East Enders fail.

126
00:12:26,040 --> 00:12:29,800
 I owe a lot of, like, him and Dale fans to me. Yeah, you're right. Well, he's always doing embarrassing

127
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:33,560
 stuff in East Enders, so this just fits with his character. Maybe it was a bit of method acting.

128
00:12:33,560 --> 00:12:37,080
 No, I'd never really heard of Adam Woodjatt before this, but he's like the right person.

129
00:12:37,080 --> 00:12:39,240
 He's like the right person. He's like the right person. He's like the right person.

130
00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:42,440
 Yeah, he did. Oh my god. I have a question about the sleeping bag person.

131
00:12:42,440 --> 00:12:48,040
 Yes. Did the sleeping bag person run it with the sleeping bag on this way, or this way?

132
00:12:48,040 --> 00:12:51,720
 Oh, sorry. I should clarify for people listening to this because it's an audio thing.

133
00:12:53,800 --> 00:12:59,880
 The thing is, how many ways are there? You said this way. No one's a home gang while there's

134
00:12:59,880 --> 00:13:06,440
 at least six ways. Sorry, okay. I reckon, and I don't know this, but I reckon it must have been like

135
00:13:06,440 --> 00:13:12,360
 this way. Oh, I see. Yeah, I think about it. That makes most sense. You're right.

136
00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:17,480
 I think, like, one of the sac races. Yeah, but I think I would run faster. If I unzipped it a bit

137
00:13:17,480 --> 00:13:22,040
 the legs and headed on over my head with some eye holes. Eye holes, but you can't have eye holes.

138
00:13:22,040 --> 00:13:27,960
 It's world record. Oh, sorry. Is that cheating? I think so. It compromised the sleeping bag, I guess.

139
00:13:27,960 --> 00:13:33,320
 Yeah, and some other records, Beaton, the fastest marathon as someone dressed as a swimmer,

140
00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:38,760
 a star, a crustacean, an elf, a fast food item, and a toilet roll.

141
00:13:38,760 --> 00:13:45,240
 Stressed as a swimmer? That was the least effort I've ever had anyone put into a costume.

142
00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:48,760
 It'd be great when he passed the starfish in the crustacean because he could just make it look like

143
00:13:48,760 --> 00:13:53,720
 he's even under water. Yeah, did he have to act out like he was swimming? No, he just wore

144
00:13:53,720 --> 00:13:58,520
 trunks. Right. Yeah, that's not, if anything, that should be faster than the runners because he's

145
00:13:58,520 --> 00:14:03,880
 got less air resistance. He should have won the actual marathon. What's amazing as well is,

146
00:14:03,880 --> 00:14:09,560
 none of these are set new records. These are all broke existing records. So there must be a massive

147
00:14:09,560 --> 00:14:13,480
 list somewhere where people are going, I really want a record. What do I need to do? I can dress

148
00:14:13,480 --> 00:14:18,280
 as a giant hot dog. Okay, I'll go and I'll try and smash that one this year. So that's all they've

149
00:14:18,280 --> 00:14:23,880
 done, right? Yeah, I guess you're right. What about this tumble dry guy? Oh, well, he was, I can't

150
00:14:23,880 --> 00:14:30,840
 remember his name, it's in the book. He basically decided he wanted to carry an item of kitchen equipment

151
00:14:30,840 --> 00:14:35,880
 and it was allowed to be any of them, but he tried originally with a fridge, I think. See, I would

152
00:14:35,880 --> 00:14:42,600
 have gone spatula. I would have immediately. He tried with a fridge and then decided it wasn't

153
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:46,840
 really working because it was too big and then went with the tumble dryer. And apparently in his

154
00:14:46,840 --> 00:14:51,640
 hometown, he was practicing and he kept being stopped by the police. I thought he was the world's

155
00:14:51,640 --> 00:15:01,080
 most brazen thief. The great one is the gorilla. I'm sure you guys see the guy who did the marathon

156
00:15:01,080 --> 00:15:06,280
 as a gorilla. He was a policeman, must he? Yeah, yeah, that's right. So he completed it by walking

157
00:15:06,280 --> 00:15:12,360
 as a gorilla and it took him. He didn't walk as a gorilla. He was like on his hands and knees.

158
00:15:12,360 --> 00:15:15,720
 He was on his hands and knees. He was quoted because he was stopped halfway through the race,

159
00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:20,280
 or along the race, asking any advice for anyone who wants to travel as a gorilla in a marathon

160
00:15:20,280 --> 00:15:25,800
 in future. And his quotes is get a bit more training in. We only did about four crawling sessions

161
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:30,920
 beforehand. I'd also recommend painkillers and bloody mindedness. Anyway, I'd better get crawling.

162
00:15:30,920 --> 00:15:35,400
 He even wants to be in the confiscated as bananas at the entrance, isn't he?

163
00:15:35,400 --> 00:15:42,680
 He was even slower than Adam Witt, yeah, wasn't he? He was like, was it six days?

164
00:15:42,680 --> 00:15:47,880
 He takes six days and eight, six and a half days? Yeah, that's a lot slower than Adam Witt.

165
00:15:47,880 --> 00:15:54,200
 He wasn't there for a week. No, you're right. But I think in order to get a medal, you need to do

166
00:15:54,200 --> 00:16:00,520
 it in something like six hours. So he was only six days out of getting a medal. But there is a lot

167
00:16:00,520 --> 00:16:05,160
 of spot in this book, isn't it? There is. I was going to say, can I quickly read out my favorite

168
00:16:05,160 --> 00:16:11,080
 sport fact from this book? This is a fact that was found from James, found by James. And that is

169
00:16:11,080 --> 00:16:18,840
 a non-leg footballer and Aberdeen missed the goal so badly that they found the ball 1,800 kilometers

170
00:16:18,840 --> 00:16:26,520
 away in Norway. So his shot went past the goal. It went into the river D and it just went into the

171
00:16:26,520 --> 00:16:33,880
 North Sea and it just floated away. And then ages later, because for the fact that they had the name

172
00:16:33,880 --> 00:16:39,080
 of their team on the ball, they got an email from a small island off the coast of Norway called

173
00:16:39,080 --> 00:16:47,320
 Vanna, who said, we've got your ball. And so they returned it and they have the ball back again.

174
00:16:47,320 --> 00:16:52,360
 That's so sweet. There was actually this week, there was a fifth league football match in Romania

175
00:16:52,360 --> 00:16:57,320
 that had to be called off before it finished because all of the spare balls ended up in the river.

176
00:16:57,320 --> 00:17:00,920
 So they had a dozen spare balls and then they had to finish it. It was something like the 58th

177
00:17:00,920 --> 00:17:05,480
 minute or something. They had to end the match because they didn't only balls left. So these things

178
00:17:05,480 --> 00:17:11,720
 happened. It's not playing by rivers or seas. We should move on to our next fact again,

179
00:17:11,720 --> 00:17:18,520
 like in Titish. So we're going to move on to fact number 3 and that is Andy. My fact is that the

180
00:17:18,520 --> 00:17:26,760
 Queen's nickname is Gary. Is that your personal nickname for her? No, it's even better. It's a family

181
00:17:26,760 --> 00:17:32,520
 nickname for the Queen. So this was something we found out this year and it's something that Prince

182
00:17:32,520 --> 00:17:39,000
 William called her when he was a child because he was unable to pronounce Grammy. So he would call

183
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:47,160
 her Gary instead. I just think that's very sweet. Apparently Prince Philip calls her Cabbage.

184
00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:55,160
 Oh, okay. Do we know why? He can't pronounce Elizabeth. She just comes out like that.

185
00:17:55,160 --> 00:17:59,800
 He retired this year, didn't he? That's in the book. Oh yeah, we wrote about that. So he

186
00:17:59,800 --> 00:18:05,880
 retired this year and it's been a huge disappointment to this one small island at Vanuatu, an island

187
00:18:05,880 --> 00:18:11,800
 called Tanner because the people who revere him as a god have been waiting five decades for him to

188
00:18:11,800 --> 00:18:16,760
 come and he's now no longer coming. So they're devastated. It's really, really bad news over there.

189
00:18:16,760 --> 00:18:20,680
 They must have seen it coming when the clock ticked over on the fourth decade.

190
00:18:20,680 --> 00:18:27,800
 Yeah, he's a god. He's a god. He's still retired, are they? I guess not. No. Apparently one of the

191
00:18:27,800 --> 00:18:34,120
 things about that is if he and the Queen ever went to this island and the Queen ever witnessed him

192
00:18:34,120 --> 00:18:39,800
 publicly drinking Carver, the local drink, then local etiquette dictates that she would have to be

193
00:18:39,800 --> 00:18:44,040
 instantly executed by a single blow to the head with a vegetable.

194
00:18:44,040 --> 00:18:53,320
 Well, we found out another nickname, whose nickname was it? Oh, Camilla, Parker Bowles. That's right.

195
00:18:53,320 --> 00:18:59,800
 The Duchess of Cornwall. The Duchess of Cornwall. She said that her nickname at school was the

196
00:18:59,800 --> 00:19:15,640
 growler because... I expected more from you. Because she was so bad at singing, is the reason. Sean

197
00:19:15,640 --> 00:19:22,120
 Spicer was once called Sean Sphinxer. I think he was called that when he was at uni and one of the

198
00:19:22,120 --> 00:19:27,160
 University magazine called him Sean Sphinxer and then he got very, very upset and they said it was just

199
00:19:27,160 --> 00:19:33,880
 a totally innocent auto-correct, but... I don't think auto-correct kind of existed when Spicer was at

200
00:19:33,880 --> 00:19:43,160
 university. No, and also Spicer is a word, isn't it? This is a great one. This was a scientific paper

201
00:19:43,160 --> 00:19:48,120
 published this year. This is just to do with names. There was a paper published about the evolution

202
00:19:48,120 --> 00:19:52,680
 of the horse hoof, talking about the number of toes it used to have because it now has one toe and

203
00:19:52,680 --> 00:20:00,760
 it used to have more. The lead writer of that paper is called Brianna McHorse. McHorse is a surname.

204
00:20:00,760 --> 00:20:05,480
 She sounds like she was named by the internet, doesn't she? Yeah, she does. She's a Bodie McBoch Horse,

205
00:20:05,480 --> 00:20:11,720
 she's... Yeah, that's true. This is like, so Canada got a new national bird. This is in the books

206
00:20:11,720 --> 00:20:16,920
 I think it was last year. So Canada's new national bird is the Grey J, but the person who set up the

207
00:20:16,920 --> 00:20:22,680
 campaign for them to get a new national bird was called Professor David Bird. That's good. That

208
00:20:22,680 --> 00:20:28,120
 reminds me, there's a tennis player who's currently playing. He's a tennis player from Tennessee,

209
00:20:28,120 --> 00:20:37,480
 and he's called tennis. No. He's called tennis Sandgren, okay? And on Wikipedia it says, "Although tennis

210
00:20:37,480 --> 00:20:43,240
 Sandgren is a tennis player from Tennessee, he is actually named after his great-grandfather,

211
00:20:43,240 --> 00:20:53,560
 who did not play tennis and was not from Tennessee." James, you found out about the names of the year.

212
00:20:53,560 --> 00:20:59,960
 Oh, I love those guys. Yeah. There's an online competition every year to find the best-named person,

213
00:20:59,960 --> 00:21:05,000
 and it's all real people from all over the world and it's done by an online vote, and I'm sure you

214
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:11,320
 have some of them. Well, I know that the winner was Boats Boats. Yep. Have you just said to James,

215
00:21:11,320 --> 00:21:15,240
 you found out about the names of the year, and then relied on him? No, I've got them here. I don't

216
00:21:15,240 --> 00:21:20,360
 want to take credit for them. Well, let me say the people who Boats Boats beat to get to the final.

217
00:21:20,360 --> 00:21:27,720
 He beat Eliza Fox Teats, Bird Love God, Aphrodite Bodycomb,

218
00:21:27,720 --> 00:21:32,600
 Quinterius Monday, and Andy Brandy, Casa Grande.

219
00:21:32,600 --> 00:21:41,000
 But we've actually, as we were writing this book, we've come across loads of better names,

220
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:45,720
 even than those, haven't we? Yeah, yeah. I really like this is one that's under the entry, Kinky.

221
00:21:45,720 --> 00:21:52,600
 This is further down, but just for the sake of knowing, Europe opened its first sex doll brothel

222
00:21:52,600 --> 00:22:00,120
 this year, and it has a staff of four dolls and stuff, just letting you know it's in the book.

223
00:22:00,120 --> 00:22:05,960
 But in that article, in the Kinky article, I found this year that there's a cop in America

224
00:22:05,960 --> 00:22:10,200
 who was suspended from the force after it was discovered that her previous occupation was a

225
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:17,320
 dominatrix, and that's what she did. And her name is Officer Hyman, that's her name. And she was told

226
00:22:17,320 --> 00:22:21,880
 she could stay on on the condition that she passed a psychiatric exam to prove she wasn't prone to

227
00:22:21,880 --> 00:22:30,600
 using excessive force. Did you guys see Tatler released a list of poshest baby names in the last

228
00:22:30,600 --> 00:22:36,440
 couple of weeks? It was bizarre. So, hey, it shows weird self-awareness of Tatler to say these are

229
00:22:36,440 --> 00:22:41,640
 the poshest names. We know about this, if we know about anything. And it said for girls, it said,

230
00:22:41,640 --> 00:22:47,160
 these are real names, we promise, with no evidence to back that up. But it said for girls, best names

231
00:22:47,160 --> 00:22:54,440
 you can name your kid are Scar, Zaza, Figgy or Monovine. And then for boys, you could call your son

232
00:22:54,440 --> 00:23:00,520
 Barclay Mow, which probably presumably I've run it. I'm chairman. I guess so. Well, you wouldn't

233
00:23:00,520 --> 00:23:09,160
 call him chairman, would you? Other names they recommend for a boy, Wigbert? Wigbert? Yeah, so maybe

234
00:23:09,160 --> 00:23:16,040
 rethink your exorias, quail and Peter, but starting with an N, but the N is silent. Okay.

235
00:23:16,040 --> 00:23:25,080
 I've got another one, which is that this is under the entry Northern Lights in the book,

236
00:23:25,080 --> 00:23:30,040
 and we found this amazing thing. It was found in the middle of last year, but it's been debated

237
00:23:30,040 --> 00:23:34,600
 about since last year, up until this year, and they finally announced that they finally know what

238
00:23:34,600 --> 00:23:39,400
 it is. So they thought that this was a part of the Aurora Borealis for years. It was a light

239
00:23:39,400 --> 00:23:43,160
 phenomenon that was happening in the sky, thought it was just a part of the Northern Lights.

240
00:23:43,160 --> 00:23:47,480
 And there's a Facebook group of Aurora Spodders who kept looking at it going, I'm not sure that this

241
00:23:47,480 --> 00:23:52,200
 is the Aurora Borealis. And it turns out they were right, that it was this amazing new light

242
00:23:52,200 --> 00:23:57,480
 phenomenon that's been there since, you know, since we've had eyes and seen things. Maybe even

243
00:23:57,480 --> 00:24:05,320
 before that. Maybe even before, but actually, that's a good point, yeah. Yeah. So just like two days before

244
00:24:05,320 --> 00:24:12,120
 we had eyes, that started. And so that's incredible. Unfortunately, it has been named by the public,

245
00:24:12,120 --> 00:24:21,000
 so it's now called Steve. Get some beautiful Steve's. Yeah, come on. And they tried to backtrack it

246
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:25,960
 to say, oh, that it has a real scientific name. So what they said that it might stand for is strong

247
00:24:25,960 --> 00:24:31,960
 thermal emission velocity enhancement. But actually, it's named after a cartoon called Over the

248
00:24:31,960 --> 00:24:38,520
 Hedge, which is a sort of animation for kids. And it's a talking squirrel who names a hedge Steve.

249
00:24:38,520 --> 00:24:42,440
 And that's why it's got its name. I think just don't ask the public to name things.

250
00:24:42,440 --> 00:24:51,160
 Don't ask the public, yeah. There was a orangutan with white fur. It was found this year in Bonio.

251
00:24:51,160 --> 00:24:55,480
 And they asked the public to name that. It's the first albino orangutan that these guys have ever

252
00:24:55,480 --> 00:25:00,760
 found. And the public actually came up with a decent name, which was alba meaning white, which is

253
00:25:00,760 --> 00:25:06,920
 quite good. They sensibly ignored other suggestions, such as meringue u tab.

254
00:25:06,920 --> 00:25:17,960
 I stand by my decision to submit this. And a rang no tab.

255
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:27,800
 Which is really good. All right, we're going to have to move on to our final fact of the show.

256
00:25:27,800 --> 00:25:34,760
 This is my fact, and this is under Queensland, Australian Queensland police successfully lowered

257
00:25:34,760 --> 00:25:43,160
 crime rates this year by asking victims to stop reporting crimes. So this was discovered in a

258
00:25:43,160 --> 00:25:48,760
 report that's been carried out, I believe, from 2011 to 2016. They noticed that the crime rates have

259
00:25:48,760 --> 00:25:52,200
 gone down. They thought this is going great. But then they noticed that there were all these things

260
00:25:52,200 --> 00:25:56,360
 that were leading to the fact that no crimes were being reported. Amongst them were things like they

261
00:25:56,360 --> 00:26:01,720
 didn't say that something was a crime. They would say it was an unfounded thing. They would write to

262
00:26:01,720 --> 00:26:06,280
 the people who had reported crimes and say, "Just want to check that you actually did want to report

263
00:26:06,280 --> 00:26:10,600
 that crime. Let us know in the next seven days. If we don't hear back from you, we'll just assume

264
00:26:10,600 --> 00:26:15,560
 you didn't want to report that crime." And so as a result, they lowered it by huge amount. It was,

265
00:26:15,560 --> 00:26:20,680
 they discovered 22% of all the cases that were logged in the police force were using this method to

266
00:26:20,680 --> 00:26:25,800
 stop it from being reported as a crime. And the reason being is they were getting mounting pressure

267
00:26:25,800 --> 00:26:29,560
 from the government saying, "Your crime rates are so high. We need you to get them down." And they

268
00:26:29,560 --> 00:26:33,720
 went, "Well, there's a very quick way that we can do that." But did you see the other way they

269
00:26:33,720 --> 00:26:38,760
 tried to, Brisbane's in Queensland, right? Yeah. Okay, so this is another way they tried to cut down

270
00:26:38,760 --> 00:26:46,120
 an anti-social behaviour. Brisbane launched that, "Don't be a dickhead campaign." Apparently,

271
00:26:46,120 --> 00:26:52,840
 Queensland fortitude valley's police guy Simon Turner said, "Dickhead is a term that means your

272
00:26:52,840 --> 00:26:59,080
 behaviour is unacceptable." Oh, what? "You're either a decent bloke or a dickhead." Well, this

273
00:26:59,080 --> 00:27:08,200
 cast of very new lies on my school days, I must say. Yeah. And while this was happening, there was a

274
00:27:08,200 --> 00:27:14,520
 Queensland banana farm worker called Lee de Pau, and he tried to impress a girl by jumping into a river

275
00:27:14,520 --> 00:27:21,560
 after drinking about 10 cups of goon, which is like wine. Goon is boxed wine that comes in a,

276
00:27:21,560 --> 00:27:27,800
 what looks like alien tinfoil, okay, with a little thing, and then you press it. With a box outside it.

277
00:27:27,800 --> 00:27:31,960
 Yeah. But then you can, yeah, fit in your bag if you squeeze it in. That's not the important part of the

278
00:27:31,960 --> 00:27:37,480
 story, guys. We all know about boxed wine. What's going goon today? What you can do is when you finish it,

279
00:27:37,480 --> 00:27:42,200
 if you're very drunk, which I've done, as I'm Australian, you'll be out in a park on your own,

280
00:27:42,200 --> 00:27:46,280
 and you'll be like, "I'm really tired, and I've just finished my goon." You can actually blow into the

281
00:27:46,280 --> 00:27:52,920
 goon and blow it up like a pillow and then fall asleep on the, so it's a really practical drink,

282
00:27:52,920 --> 00:27:57,160
 actually. You can't do that on an empty bottle, for example. And they've never thought of that,

283
00:27:57,160 --> 00:28:01,160
 and they're marketing, and I think they definitely should. Very good point. Well, he could have blown it

284
00:28:01,160 --> 00:28:06,040
 up and used it as like water wings or something, because he jumped into this river to impress a girl

285
00:28:06,040 --> 00:28:12,440
 and was immediately mulled by a three-meter-long crocodile. I don't think water wings stop crocodiles.

286
00:28:12,440 --> 00:28:19,240
 Well, he managed to fight it off, but the lady who's trying to impress Sophie Patterson said,

287
00:28:19,240 --> 00:28:21,880
 "Being attacked by animals doesn't really do it for me."

288
00:28:21,880 --> 00:28:28,520
 Yeah. She's a weird one. She did say, "I'd have to be quite twisted to be impressed by that."

289
00:28:28,520 --> 00:28:35,720
 One of my favourite criminals of the year was he was in the balloon section,

290
00:28:35,720 --> 00:28:42,600
 and he was a man who was fined this year by a court in Canada for flying up in a chair with lots

291
00:28:42,600 --> 00:28:47,240
 of helium balloons attached to it. It's the real thing. He was inspired by the film "Up" and he did it

292
00:28:47,240 --> 00:28:52,200
 to promote his cleaning company. Another cartoon. Another cartoon? You was trying to fly high enough to see Steve.

293
00:28:52,200 --> 00:29:02,120
 And he flew up. He flew up 4,000 feet? He flew up 4 kilometers. So 4,000 meters.

294
00:29:02,120 --> 00:29:07,960
 And two commercial airliners flew underneath him while he was up in his chair. He landed safely.

295
00:29:07,960 --> 00:29:11,560
 He injured his ankle slightly on landing, but he was otherwise fine. And the court

296
00:29:11,560 --> 00:29:15,080
 fined him. They said he had been what was it? Unconsciously stupid. Unconsciously stupid, yeah.

297
00:29:15,080 --> 00:29:20,200
 But you can't agree with the court. I mean, you just read that story and you go,

298
00:29:20,200 --> 00:29:26,120
 "Wouldn't absolute hero." I know I should disapprove, but my god, that's cool.

299
00:29:26,120 --> 00:29:31,160
 This was my favourite crime story from the year. A used car dealership in Fort Worth and Dallas

300
00:29:31,160 --> 00:29:35,560
 was being robbed so many times. Just constantly getting robbed. The police weren't able to stop it.

301
00:29:35,560 --> 00:29:41,000
 That the guy who ran it, the owner, bought a guard dog. So he was like, "Great, guard dog here. Stop the

302
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:45,160
 robbers. Did not stop the robbers. Robbers came back. Rob the place again. Then as they were leaving,

303
00:29:45,160 --> 00:29:53,320
 stole the guard dog with them." There was also a good, uh, similarly fitting crime. It was a news

304
00:29:53,320 --> 00:30:00,680
 crew had gone to cover the problem of urban crime in Albuquerque and the, as they left their fan,

305
00:30:00,680 --> 00:30:04,360
 where they had all their filming equipment and they went to film about urban crime and they came

306
00:30:04,360 --> 00:30:09,000
 back and they found all their stuff and it had been stolen. And so Michelle Donaldson, who was the

307
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:13,960
 news director, said, "I have one rule that you should never be the lead story in your own news car."

308
00:30:13,960 --> 00:30:21,800
 This has violated that rule. And you went on a trek on the internet to find as many bandits as

309
00:30:21,800 --> 00:30:26,440
 you could, didn't you? Yeah. So you get people nicknamed the Such and Such Bandit because they robbed,

310
00:30:26,440 --> 00:30:31,320
 you know, a particular kind of place. So one example is the coast-to-coast bandit who only

311
00:30:31,320 --> 00:30:36,280
 robbed banks in New York and Los Angeles. Yes. And there was, what was there? There was the lunchtime

312
00:30:36,280 --> 00:30:43,560
 bandit who only robbed banks between noon and 1 p.m. and the bag trick bandit who kept putting his

313
00:30:43,560 --> 00:30:48,040
 hand in his pocket and pretending to have a gun. Well, he didn't have a gun. That was his clever trick.

314
00:30:48,040 --> 00:30:54,200
 The spelling bee bandit. Oh, the spelling bee bandit. He would pass a note to the cashier

315
00:30:54,200 --> 00:31:02,440
 in the bank saying, "This is a robbery." And this one probably doesn't need explaining, but it's

316
00:31:02,440 --> 00:31:11,880
 the Texas butthole tickling bandit. He was from Texas, I think. I knew you were going to read that one.

317
00:31:11,880 --> 00:31:18,680
 I liked one of my favourite criminals was in North Carolina. And so this was this year when a

318
00:31:18,680 --> 00:31:25,240
 500 million dollar opium-growing operation was busted. And it was when an investigator visited someone

319
00:31:25,240 --> 00:31:29,800
 on a completely unrelated matter, knocked on this guy's door. He was a farmer, knocked on his door.

320
00:31:29,800 --> 00:31:32,120
 And he opened the door and said, "I guess you're here about the opium."

321
00:31:32,120 --> 00:31:43,240
 Well, now. I really like this one. So when we decided that we were going to write this book,

322
00:31:43,240 --> 00:31:49,640
 we started this document between us and every week we started putting in sort of our favourite headlines

323
00:31:49,640 --> 00:31:54,200
 or little facts that we found. And to begin with, we didn't know if this would work as a book,

324
00:31:54,200 --> 00:31:59,640
 because we'd never done it before, we'd never tried. And I saw this one fact which was sent by James,

325
00:31:59,640 --> 00:32:03,720
 you put this into the document. And I thought, "Ah, this might actually work." And it was an arrest.

326
00:32:03,720 --> 00:32:08,440
 And it's under in the book Arrests Coma Human. Surprisingly, we have an entry which is a

327
00:32:08,440 --> 00:32:14,680
 arrest common non-human. A man in India this year was arrested for trying to create a fake ID card

328
00:32:14,680 --> 00:32:19,960
 using the name Osama Bin Laden. So he thought, "This will work. I'll just put Osama Bin Laden's name on

329
00:32:19,960 --> 00:32:25,720
 this." Not only that, he uploaded a blurred picture of Osama Bin Laden as the picture of his

330
00:32:25,720 --> 00:32:32,280
 ID card. So the police investigated and they arrested the man. The man, it turns out, his real name

331
00:32:32,280 --> 00:32:46,120
 is Saddam Hussein. Okay, that's it. That's all of our facts. Thank you so much for listening. If you

332
