00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.880
 So the episode you're about to hear was recorded at the Cheltenham Literature Festival and every single

00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:08.880
 fact in it is from the book. So it will give you a good idea about what you're going to be buying.

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:10.720
 It was an awesome gig. Hope you enjoy.

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:31.800
 Hello and welcome to another episode of No Such Thing as a Fish, a weekly podcast this week

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:34.440
 coming to you from the Cheltenham Literature Festival.

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:42.200
 My name is Dan Schreiber. I'm sitting here with Anna Chazinski, Andrew Huntamari, and James

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:46.200
 Harkin. And once again, we have gathered around the microphones with our four favorite facts

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:52.280
 from the last seven days. And in no particular order, here we go. Starting with you, Chazinski.

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:59.880
 My fact this week is that this year the phrase "Make America Great Again" adorned half a million hats

00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:01.560
 and one a-ness.

00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:10.200
 That is legally contentious, as a way of describing the president.

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:20.760
 So this is, of course, the MAGA caps. If you weren't living in a cave, the MAGA appeared on lots of

00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:29.160
 caps that were sold throughout America, but also LGBTQ performance artist Abel Azcona had himself

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:37.000
 tattooed, stenciled on the bottom, with "Make America Great Again" with the MAGA. And he said it was

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:43.320
 an a subversive action. So he said, "The anus is a land of pleasure and a terrarium of empowerment

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:48.760
 for many." I didn't know. A terrarium terrarium is very unusual. I thought a terrarium was where

00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:55.480
 you kept ants. No, that's a formicarium. A terrarium is where you keep snakes and things like that.

00:01:55.480 --> 00:02:00.920
 Oh right, okay. That's much better right. Is it why you keep... Shoddy, it's just a place it's

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:06.040
 full of earth. I mean, we already is vexed, it's the point of time.

00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:13.240
 So he concluded that writing a fascist political motto like that is what is not mine.

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:19.080
 "In my anus" is a clearly critical and subversive action, so that's what's in it. The anus is what you're

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:25.000
 saying. Oh god. I think it was... It was a lot to know this, Andy. It was a possibility. It could be

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:30.200
 surrounding. Yeah, that's what that was. Yeah, as well. He did say it in, but I think it's on the edge.

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:35.320
 Inside? No, come on. You don't write the word polo inside the mint. You write it around the...

00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:42.280
 So what's interesting about this guy is that he's done it, but he doesn't regress it. And we

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:48.120
 read a story last year about a guy called Joshua who done a similar thing. He was a big fan of Bernie

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:53.880
 Sanders, but he did regret his tattoo, which was a tattoo on his penis, which said feel the burn.

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:59.720
 And then he did that in the primaries, and then Hillary got it, and he was like, oh, I have made a

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:05.720
 terrible mistake. This is still 2020, isn't it? That's true. So do you know,

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:12.360
 make America great again was actually Ronald Reagan's campaign slogan? Or his was not exactly the same,

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:18.920
 his was let's make America great again. And also his next phrase, he's already worked out what

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:25.880
 it'll be in 2020. Really? Yeah, he's going to go for keep America great exclamation point. That's

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:32.040
 what he says. But unfortunately, that's already taken by a horror movie. It's in purge election

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:37.720
 year, which is a movie that came out last year. Wow. So he's not allowed to use it? Well, I think he will

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:45.720
 anyway. Could he put maybe a question mark on the end instead of something? Yeah. He did really

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:50.040
 specifically say the exclamation point when they asked him about it. Did he? Well, he said the words

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:55.480
 exclamation point, or he just said it like he says stuff. I mean, it's such, three years is such a long

00:03:55.480 --> 00:04:00.200
 time in politics, isn't it? I think we can, you know, we don't know if that'll be the slogan. He

00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:04.120
 might change it to something realistic, like let us fight the cockroaches among the Radio Act.

00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:15.160
 He did get, he got in another legal copyright dispute. I mean, he has a lot of lawsuits all the time,

00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:21.800
 but there was one lawsuit that Trump got involved in, which was over an app for the iPhone,

00:04:21.800 --> 00:04:29.640
 and the app was called iTrump, okay? So it was, and it was against a trumpet teacher, an

00:04:29.640 --> 00:04:34.680
 amateur musician. He's a 40-year-old guy called Thomas Schaffeld, and they had this, I think,

00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:39.640
 a six-year legal battle where Schaffeld represented himself in court against all of Trump's lawyers,

00:04:39.640 --> 00:04:44.840
 and he won. So the eye Trump now belongs to this trumpet guy. Awesome. Yeah. Have you ever heard of

00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:49.480
 Eddie Trump? No. I don't know how to describe this guy, but so there's this Per Brothers, real estate

00:04:49.480 --> 00:04:56.200
 developers called the Trump Brothers. One of them's Eddie Trump in 2013 ABC News had a list of the

00:04:56.200 --> 00:05:02.440
 top 50 most influential ultra-high net worth individuals. There was one Trump on it. It was Eddie

00:05:02.440 --> 00:05:09.240
 Trump bizarrely, but in the 1980s, they had this real estate company, and Donald Trump found out

00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:13.480
 about it when he received a letter accidentally sent to him, which was meant for Eddie Trump,

00:05:13.480 --> 00:05:18.840
 and so he spent the next many years trying to sue them for using the Trump name, his own name

00:05:18.840 --> 00:05:23.000
 on their business, despite them being called the Trumps. And he lost that case, but that's amazing.

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:28.200
 Simmer. One of my favorite Trump stories from this year, and it's made it into the book

00:05:28.200 --> 00:05:34.520
 under the title "Protests, Non-Dirty," because we have a dirty protest section.

00:05:34.520 --> 00:05:42.280
 Is that a US cabinet member, who's Wilbur Ross, praised Donald Trump's trip to Saudi Arabia,

00:05:42.280 --> 00:05:47.720
 saying it was so successful that there wasn't a single protestor failing to recognize that

00:05:47.720 --> 00:05:53.400
 protesting is illegal in Saudi Arabia. And he was on a TV show talking about it,

00:05:53.400 --> 00:05:57.960
 saying it was fascinating. There was not one bad guy with a bad placard standing there doing

00:05:57.960 --> 00:06:02.040
 anything, and when the reporter said, "Yeah, but that's because he would go to jail for up to 15

00:06:02.040 --> 00:06:06.680
 years if he was standing doing that." In theory, that could be true. Yeah, yeah. But really,

00:06:06.680 --> 00:06:12.280
 it was amazing. Just no one was there. Well, he's not had the best time abroad,

00:06:12.280 --> 00:06:17.560
 has he Trump. He went to the G20, and he was sat next to it one of the dinners, the first lady

00:06:17.560 --> 00:06:22.360
 of Japan. And he said it was quite tough to sit next to her because she didn't speak any English.

00:06:22.360 --> 00:06:26.920
 The problem is, if you go on the internet, you can look at videos of her and she speaks perfect English.

00:06:26.920 --> 00:06:37.400
 So just completely affected. Amazing. There was one line of his, which I think encapsulated a lot

00:06:37.400 --> 00:06:45.000
 of the whole presidency so far. This was something that Dan found. He said, he was interviewed and he said,

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:50.760
 "I think we've had the most successful 13 weeks in the history of the presidency." Unfortunately,

00:06:50.760 --> 00:06:59.000
 he said that only 11 weeks into his presidency. Actually, we wrote an article in the book on the

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:03.240
 inauguration, and we did it in numbers because that was obviously the big thing where he said,

00:07:03.240 --> 00:07:09.640
 "Biggest inauguration ever, period." And Andy did this whole article about the many little numbers

00:07:09.640 --> 00:07:14.120
 that didn't get reported. Do you have any examples? Yes. Oh, what was this? So the crowd was meant

00:07:14.120 --> 00:07:19.320
 to be 1.5 million, and actually it was worked out at three to six hundred thousand, which is still

00:07:19.320 --> 00:07:24.520
 a lot of people. What, you mean three hundred thousand to six hundred thousand? Sorry, I don't mean

00:07:24.520 --> 00:07:32.360
 minimum three maximum six hundred thousand. What else was there? There were, oh, things,

00:07:32.360 --> 00:07:37.800
 the number of cans of ravioli. Ravioli that were confiscated by security for being a potential

00:07:37.800 --> 00:07:43.560
 risk to presidential security, which that was two. What was the thing about Don's John's?

00:07:43.560 --> 00:07:49.320
 Oh, yeah, all the, all the porters for the crowds who turned up were brought by a company, which is

00:07:49.320 --> 00:07:55.320
 genuinely called Don's John's, and they feared that people might make jokes about this, so they covered

00:07:55.320 --> 00:08:00.360
 all the labels up with blue tape on the day. So it's got a thin skinned ring. And they also confiscated

00:08:00.360 --> 00:08:07.000
 from people coming into the inauguration bananas. So if you had a banana, it wasn't allowed in unless

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:11.800
 it was sliced. So they would say, "May I see your lunchbox?" I'm sorry, that bananas in full form.

00:08:11.800 --> 00:08:18.680
 So another thing that Trump said that people, according to question this year, was that he invented

00:08:18.680 --> 00:08:24.920
 the phrase priming the pump. Do people remember that? So he used the phrase priming the pump, and then he

00:08:24.920 --> 00:08:29.480
 said, have you heard that expression before because I haven't heard it? I mean, I just made it up a

00:08:29.480 --> 00:08:34.600
 couple of days ago. That's just the kind of thing I have to do. And of course, he didn't make it up,

00:08:34.600 --> 00:08:41.160
 it dates back to 1819, I think, in a Walter Scott story, which then I ended up reading in preparation

00:08:41.160 --> 00:08:46.600
 for this. It's great, but Walter Scott's actually talking about a woman who comes up to him at a party

00:08:46.600 --> 00:08:51.720
 and says to him, "I really loved your latest book, but he'd written it under a pseudonym." So she was

00:08:51.720 --> 00:08:56.120
 actually bragging to him and saying, "Haha, I've got you. I know it's you." And so he's talking about

00:08:56.120 --> 00:09:00.680
 how annoyed he is that she's trying to prime the pump with flattery. But yeah, he also

00:09:00.680 --> 00:09:06.360
 claimed this week, I think, or last week, to have invented fake news. I think I'd give him that.

00:09:06.360 --> 00:09:12.680
 No, it was even just the word fake because he didn't get to news. So I think he did meet

00:09:12.680 --> 00:09:17.000
 mean fake news, but he's sitting next to Pence in it, and that's the best bit because he says,

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:20.760
 "No, many people know. I invented the word fake." And Pence is like, "Yeah, he did."

00:09:22.120 --> 00:09:27.160
 He's such a good best friend. He's so good. It's not done him too much harm. So, for example,

00:09:27.160 --> 00:09:34.120
 since the election, at least two babies in Iraq have been named Trump. So he's got that.

00:09:34.120 --> 00:09:38.680
 That's a take away. They're going to go through life answering questions about that.

00:09:38.680 --> 00:09:44.680
 Well, here's an interesting thing. I went to Kosovo quite a few years ago, and I was told while I was

00:09:44.680 --> 00:09:49.480
 out there that a popular name that was happening amongst boys in Kosovo, new names,

00:09:49.480 --> 00:09:57.400
 was Tonneblur, T-O-N-B-L-R, and it's a tribute to Tony Blair because of the, I think there's a Bill

00:09:57.400 --> 00:10:03.960
 Clinton, Bill of Adela, Christina. There's Clinton up on buildings everywhere you went. There was

00:10:03.960 --> 00:10:09.400
 pictures of Clinton, and Tonneblur is a name in Kosovo now. But the problem is with Donald is

00:10:09.400 --> 00:10:13.640
 no one's been called Donald anymore. Oh, that's true. I think there were only something like two

00:10:13.640 --> 00:10:21.320
 babies called Donald in Scotland, even last year. Even in Scotland? No, it's the home of Donald.

00:10:21.320 --> 00:10:26.040
 It's the home of the Donald. Because it's in Scotland, where can you? And apparently they did an

00:10:26.040 --> 00:10:29.960
 interview with a guy who was called Donald, and he said he had to apologise every time he went to

00:10:29.960 --> 00:10:37.960
 Starbucks. But that's because he took a poo on the account. Why did he apologise? Because they say

00:10:37.960 --> 00:10:44.120
 what's your name? And he goes, "Donald, sorry." And so he's saying about Scotland, Donald Trump has

00:10:44.120 --> 00:10:50.120
 some golf courses in Scotland. And for one of those, he wanted to have a crest for his family.

00:10:50.120 --> 00:10:56.360
 So what he did was he took an English crest and stole it and put the word "Trump" at the bottom

00:10:56.360 --> 00:10:59.480
 in place of the word that was there before that, which was integrity.

00:11:03.240 --> 00:11:07.880
 We're going to have to move on to our second fact, because we're running on a tighter podcast schedule

00:11:07.880 --> 00:11:13.080
 tonight. So we're going to move on to our second fact now, and that is James. Okay, my fact this

00:11:13.080 --> 00:11:19.960
 week is that East Enderstar Adam Woodjatt was beaten in the London marathon this year by a man

00:11:19.960 --> 00:11:26.360
 in a sleeping bag, a woman in a full-body dinosaur suit, and a man carrying a tumble dryer.

00:11:30.520 --> 00:11:37.320
 So he did the course in seven hours and four minutes, which is... Is that slow? It's quite slow, yeah.

00:11:37.320 --> 00:11:40.680
 Okay. They reckon one of the reasons might have been because he was doing so many selfies on the way.

00:11:40.680 --> 00:11:46.520
 Okay. But yeah, there were 73 world records attempted at this year's London marathon,

00:11:46.520 --> 00:11:53.880
 and 39 were broken. So this sleeping bag was broken, the dinosaur was broken. The fastest marathon

00:11:53.880 --> 00:11:59.960
 ever run by someone dressed as a witch was broken. That was by Nicola Nothol from Pendle,

00:11:59.960 --> 00:12:05.880
 and she thought she'd broken the record last year, but they nullified her results because her skirt

00:12:05.880 --> 00:12:11.080
 was too short. Oh, yeah. Apparently witches have to have a certain length of skirt.

00:12:11.080 --> 00:12:15.160
 Did not know that, yeah. How sure was Adam Woodjatt's skirt.

00:12:15.160 --> 00:12:22.200
 He's, I bet, I mean, are there any East Ender's fans in here except me? No, wow, not a single one.

00:12:22.200 --> 00:12:26.040
 No overlap between shot and the cherry festival, and East Enders fail.

00:12:26.040 --> 00:12:29.800
 I owe a lot of, like, him and Dale fans to me. Yeah, you're right. Well, he's always doing embarrassing

00:12:29.800 --> 00:12:33.560
 stuff in East Enders, so this just fits with his character. Maybe it was a bit of method acting.

00:12:33.560 --> 00:12:37.080
 No, I'd never really heard of Adam Woodjatt before this, but he's like the right person.

00:12:37.080 --> 00:12:39.240
 He's like the right person. He's like the right person. He's like the right person.

00:12:39.240 --> 00:12:42.440
 Yeah, he did. Oh my god. I have a question about the sleeping bag person.

00:12:42.440 --> 00:12:48.040
 Yes. Did the sleeping bag person run it with the sleeping bag on this way, or this way?

00:12:48.040 --> 00:12:51.720
 Oh, sorry. I should clarify for people listening to this because it's an audio thing.

00:12:53.800 --> 00:12:59.880
 The thing is, how many ways are there? You said this way. No one's a home gang while there's

00:12:59.880 --> 00:13:06.440
 at least six ways. Sorry, okay. I reckon, and I don't know this, but I reckon it must have been like

00:13:06.440 --> 00:13:12.360
 this way. Oh, I see. Yeah, I think about it. That makes most sense. You're right.

00:13:12.360 --> 00:13:17.480
 I think, like, one of the sac races. Yeah, but I think I would run faster. If I unzipped it a bit

00:13:17.480 --> 00:13:22.040
 the legs and headed on over my head with some eye holes. Eye holes, but you can't have eye holes.

00:13:22.040 --> 00:13:27.960
 It's world record. Oh, sorry. Is that cheating? I think so. It compromised the sleeping bag, I guess.

00:13:27.960 --> 00:13:33.320
 Yeah, and some other records, Beaton, the fastest marathon as someone dressed as a swimmer,

00:13:33.320 --> 00:13:38.760
 a star, a crustacean, an elf, a fast food item, and a toilet roll.

00:13:38.760 --> 00:13:45.240
 Stressed as a swimmer? That was the least effort I've ever had anyone put into a costume.

00:13:45.240 --> 00:13:48.760
 It'd be great when he passed the starfish in the crustacean because he could just make it look like

00:13:48.760 --> 00:13:53.720
 he's even under water. Yeah, did he have to act out like he was swimming? No, he just wore

00:13:53.720 --> 00:13:58.520
 trunks. Right. Yeah, that's not, if anything, that should be faster than the runners because he's

00:13:58.520 --> 00:14:03.880
 got less air resistance. He should have won the actual marathon. What's amazing as well is,

00:14:03.880 --> 00:14:09.560
 none of these are set new records. These are all broke existing records. So there must be a massive

00:14:09.560 --> 00:14:13.480
 list somewhere where people are going, I really want a record. What do I need to do? I can dress

00:14:13.480 --> 00:14:18.280
 as a giant hot dog. Okay, I'll go and I'll try and smash that one this year. So that's all they've

00:14:18.280 --> 00:14:23.880
 done, right? Yeah, I guess you're right. What about this tumble dry guy? Oh, well, he was, I can't

00:14:23.880 --> 00:14:30.840
 remember his name, it's in the book. He basically decided he wanted to carry an item of kitchen equipment

00:14:30.840 --> 00:14:35.880
 and it was allowed to be any of them, but he tried originally with a fridge, I think. See, I would

00:14:35.880 --> 00:14:42.600
 have gone spatula. I would have immediately. He tried with a fridge and then decided it wasn't

00:14:42.600 --> 00:14:46.840
 really working because it was too big and then went with the tumble dryer. And apparently in his

00:14:46.840 --> 00:14:51.640
 hometown, he was practicing and he kept being stopped by the police. I thought he was the world's

00:14:51.640 --> 00:15:01.080
 most brazen thief. The great one is the gorilla. I'm sure you guys see the guy who did the marathon

00:15:01.080 --> 00:15:06.280
 as a gorilla. He was a policeman, must he? Yeah, yeah, that's right. So he completed it by walking

00:15:06.280 --> 00:15:12.360
 as a gorilla and it took him. He didn't walk as a gorilla. He was like on his hands and knees.

00:15:12.360 --> 00:15:15.720
 He was on his hands and knees. He was quoted because he was stopped halfway through the race,

00:15:15.720 --> 00:15:20.280
 or along the race, asking any advice for anyone who wants to travel as a gorilla in a marathon

00:15:20.280 --> 00:15:25.800
 in future. And his quotes is get a bit more training in. We only did about four crawling sessions

00:15:25.800 --> 00:15:30.920
 beforehand. I'd also recommend painkillers and bloody mindedness. Anyway, I'd better get crawling.

00:15:30.920 --> 00:15:35.400
 He even wants to be in the confiscated as bananas at the entrance, isn't he?

00:15:35.400 --> 00:15:42.680
 He was even slower than Adam Witt, yeah, wasn't he? He was like, was it six days?

00:15:42.680 --> 00:15:47.880
 He takes six days and eight, six and a half days? Yeah, that's a lot slower than Adam Witt.

00:15:47.880 --> 00:15:54.200
 He wasn't there for a week. No, you're right. But I think in order to get a medal, you need to do

00:15:54.200 --> 00:16:00.520
 it in something like six hours. So he was only six days out of getting a medal. But there is a lot

00:16:00.520 --> 00:16:05.160
 of spot in this book, isn't it? There is. I was going to say, can I quickly read out my favorite

00:16:05.160 --> 00:16:11.080
 sport fact from this book? This is a fact that was found from James, found by James. And that is

00:16:11.080 --> 00:16:18.840
 a non-leg footballer and Aberdeen missed the goal so badly that they found the ball 1,800 kilometers

00:16:18.840 --> 00:16:26.520
 away in Norway. So his shot went past the goal. It went into the river D and it just went into the

00:16:26.520 --> 00:16:33.880
 North Sea and it just floated away. And then ages later, because for the fact that they had the name

00:16:33.880 --> 00:16:39.080
 of their team on the ball, they got an email from a small island off the coast of Norway called

00:16:39.080 --> 00:16:47.320
 Vanna, who said, we've got your ball. And so they returned it and they have the ball back again.

00:16:47.320 --> 00:16:52.360
 That's so sweet. There was actually this week, there was a fifth league football match in Romania

00:16:52.360 --> 00:16:57.320
 that had to be called off before it finished because all of the spare balls ended up in the river.

00:16:57.320 --> 00:17:00.920
 So they had a dozen spare balls and then they had to finish it. It was something like the 58th

00:17:00.920 --> 00:17:05.480
 minute or something. They had to end the match because they didn't only balls left. So these things

00:17:05.480 --> 00:17:11.720
 happened. It's not playing by rivers or seas. We should move on to our next fact again,

00:17:11.720 --> 00:17:18.520
 like in Titish. So we're going to move on to fact number 3 and that is Andy. My fact is that the

00:17:18.520 --> 00:17:26.760
 Queen's nickname is Gary. Is that your personal nickname for her? No, it's even better. It's a family

00:17:26.760 --> 00:17:32.520
 nickname for the Queen. So this was something we found out this year and it's something that Prince

00:17:32.520 --> 00:17:39.000
 William called her when he was a child because he was unable to pronounce Grammy. So he would call

00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:47.160
 her Gary instead. I just think that's very sweet. Apparently Prince Philip calls her Cabbage.

00:17:47.160 --> 00:17:55.160
 Oh, okay. Do we know why? He can't pronounce Elizabeth. She just comes out like that.

00:17:55.160 --> 00:17:59.800
 He retired this year, didn't he? That's in the book. Oh yeah, we wrote about that. So he

00:17:59.800 --> 00:18:05.880
 retired this year and it's been a huge disappointment to this one small island at Vanuatu, an island

00:18:05.880 --> 00:18:11.800
 called Tanner because the people who revere him as a god have been waiting five decades for him to

00:18:11.800 --> 00:18:16.760
 come and he's now no longer coming. So they're devastated. It's really, really bad news over there.

00:18:16.760 --> 00:18:20.680
 They must have seen it coming when the clock ticked over on the fourth decade.

00:18:20.680 --> 00:18:27.800
 Yeah, he's a god. He's a god. He's still retired, are they? I guess not. No. Apparently one of the

00:18:27.800 --> 00:18:34.120
 things about that is if he and the Queen ever went to this island and the Queen ever witnessed him

00:18:34.120 --> 00:18:39.800
 publicly drinking Carver, the local drink, then local etiquette dictates that she would have to be

00:18:39.800 --> 00:18:44.040
 instantly executed by a single blow to the head with a vegetable.

00:18:44.040 --> 00:18:53.320
 Well, we found out another nickname, whose nickname was it? Oh, Camilla, Parker Bowles. That's right.

00:18:53.320 --> 00:18:59.800
 The Duchess of Cornwall. The Duchess of Cornwall. She said that her nickname at school was the

00:18:59.800 --> 00:19:15.640
 growler because... I expected more from you. Because she was so bad at singing, is the reason. Sean

00:19:15.640 --> 00:19:22.120
 Spicer was once called Sean Sphinxer. I think he was called that when he was at uni and one of the

00:19:22.120 --> 00:19:27.160
 University magazine called him Sean Sphinxer and then he got very, very upset and they said it was just

00:19:27.160 --> 00:19:33.880
 a totally innocent auto-correct, but... I don't think auto-correct kind of existed when Spicer was at

00:19:33.880 --> 00:19:43.160
 university. No, and also Spicer is a word, isn't it? This is a great one. This was a scientific paper

00:19:43.160 --> 00:19:48.120
 published this year. This is just to do with names. There was a paper published about the evolution

00:19:48.120 --> 00:19:52.680
 of the horse hoof, talking about the number of toes it used to have because it now has one toe and

00:19:52.680 --> 00:20:00.760
 it used to have more. The lead writer of that paper is called Brianna McHorse. McHorse is a surname.

00:20:00.760 --> 00:20:05.480
 She sounds like she was named by the internet, doesn't she? Yeah, she does. She's a Bodie McBoch Horse,

00:20:05.480 --> 00:20:11.720
 she's... Yeah, that's true. This is like, so Canada got a new national bird. This is in the books

00:20:11.720 --> 00:20:16.920
 I think it was last year. So Canada's new national bird is the Grey J, but the person who set up the

00:20:16.920 --> 00:20:22.680
 campaign for them to get a new national bird was called Professor David Bird. That's good. That

00:20:22.680 --> 00:20:28.120
 reminds me, there's a tennis player who's currently playing. He's a tennis player from Tennessee,

00:20:28.120 --> 00:20:37.480
 and he's called tennis. No. He's called tennis Sandgren, okay? And on Wikipedia it says, "Although tennis

00:20:37.480 --> 00:20:43.240
 Sandgren is a tennis player from Tennessee, he is actually named after his great-grandfather,

00:20:43.240 --> 00:20:53.560
 who did not play tennis and was not from Tennessee." James, you found out about the names of the year.

00:20:53.560 --> 00:20:59.960
 Oh, I love those guys. Yeah. There's an online competition every year to find the best-named person,

00:20:59.960 --> 00:21:05.000
 and it's all real people from all over the world and it's done by an online vote, and I'm sure you

00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:11.320
 have some of them. Well, I know that the winner was Boats Boats. Yep. Have you just said to James,

00:21:11.320 --> 00:21:15.240
 you found out about the names of the year, and then relied on him? No, I've got them here. I don't

00:21:15.240 --> 00:21:20.360
 want to take credit for them. Well, let me say the people who Boats Boats beat to get to the final.

00:21:20.360 --> 00:21:27.720
 He beat Eliza Fox Teats, Bird Love God, Aphrodite Bodycomb,

00:21:27.720 --> 00:21:32.600
 Quinterius Monday, and Andy Brandy, Casa Grande.

00:21:32.600 --> 00:21:41.000
 But we've actually, as we were writing this book, we've come across loads of better names,

00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:45.720
 even than those, haven't we? Yeah, yeah. I really like this is one that's under the entry, Kinky.

00:21:45.720 --> 00:21:52.600
 This is further down, but just for the sake of knowing, Europe opened its first sex doll brothel

00:21:52.600 --> 00:22:00.120
 this year, and it has a staff of four dolls and stuff, just letting you know it's in the book.

00:22:00.120 --> 00:22:05.960
 But in that article, in the Kinky article, I found this year that there's a cop in America

00:22:05.960 --> 00:22:10.200
 who was suspended from the force after it was discovered that her previous occupation was a

00:22:10.200 --> 00:22:17.320
 dominatrix, and that's what she did. And her name is Officer Hyman, that's her name. And she was told

00:22:17.320 --> 00:22:21.880
 she could stay on on the condition that she passed a psychiatric exam to prove she wasn't prone to

00:22:21.880 --> 00:22:30.600
 using excessive force. Did you guys see Tatler released a list of poshest baby names in the last

00:22:30.600 --> 00:22:36.440
 couple of weeks? It was bizarre. So, hey, it shows weird self-awareness of Tatler to say these are

00:22:36.440 --> 00:22:41.640
 the poshest names. We know about this, if we know about anything. And it said for girls, it said,

00:22:41.640 --> 00:22:47.160
 these are real names, we promise, with no evidence to back that up. But it said for girls, best names

00:22:47.160 --> 00:22:54.440
 you can name your kid are Scar, Zaza, Figgy or Monovine. And then for boys, you could call your son

00:22:54.440 --> 00:23:00.520
 Barclay Mow, which probably presumably I've run it. I'm chairman. I guess so. Well, you wouldn't

00:23:00.520 --> 00:23:09.160
 call him chairman, would you? Other names they recommend for a boy, Wigbert? Wigbert? Yeah, so maybe

00:23:09.160 --> 00:23:16.040
 rethink your exorias, quail and Peter, but starting with an N, but the N is silent. Okay.

00:23:16.040 --> 00:23:25.080
 I've got another one, which is that this is under the entry Northern Lights in the book,

00:23:25.080 --> 00:23:30.040
 and we found this amazing thing. It was found in the middle of last year, but it's been debated

00:23:30.040 --> 00:23:34.600
 about since last year, up until this year, and they finally announced that they finally know what

00:23:34.600 --> 00:23:39.400
 it is. So they thought that this was a part of the Aurora Borealis for years. It was a light

00:23:39.400 --> 00:23:43.160
 phenomenon that was happening in the sky, thought it was just a part of the Northern Lights.

00:23:43.160 --> 00:23:47.480
 And there's a Facebook group of Aurora Spodders who kept looking at it going, I'm not sure that this

00:23:47.480 --> 00:23:52.200
 is the Aurora Borealis. And it turns out they were right, that it was this amazing new light

00:23:52.200 --> 00:23:57.480
 phenomenon that's been there since, you know, since we've had eyes and seen things. Maybe even

00:23:57.480 --> 00:24:05.320
 before that. Maybe even before, but actually, that's a good point, yeah. Yeah. So just like two days before

00:24:05.320 --> 00:24:12.120
 we had eyes, that started. And so that's incredible. Unfortunately, it has been named by the public,

00:24:12.120 --> 00:24:21.000
 so it's now called Steve. Get some beautiful Steve's. Yeah, come on. And they tried to backtrack it

00:24:21.000 --> 00:24:25.960
 to say, oh, that it has a real scientific name. So what they said that it might stand for is strong

00:24:25.960 --> 00:24:31.960
 thermal emission velocity enhancement. But actually, it's named after a cartoon called Over the

00:24:31.960 --> 00:24:38.520
 Hedge, which is a sort of animation for kids. And it's a talking squirrel who names a hedge Steve.

00:24:38.520 --> 00:24:42.440
 And that's why it's got its name. I think just don't ask the public to name things.

00:24:42.440 --> 00:24:51.160
 Don't ask the public, yeah. There was a orangutan with white fur. It was found this year in Bonio.

00:24:51.160 --> 00:24:55.480
 And they asked the public to name that. It's the first albino orangutan that these guys have ever

00:24:55.480 --> 00:25:00.760
 found. And the public actually came up with a decent name, which was alba meaning white, which is

00:25:00.760 --> 00:25:06.920
 quite good. They sensibly ignored other suggestions, such as meringue u tab.

00:25:06.920 --> 00:25:17.960
 I stand by my decision to submit this. And a rang no tab.

00:25:21.000 --> 00:25:27.800
 Which is really good. All right, we're going to have to move on to our final fact of the show.

00:25:27.800 --> 00:25:34.760
 This is my fact, and this is under Queensland, Australian Queensland police successfully lowered

00:25:34.760 --> 00:25:43.160
 crime rates this year by asking victims to stop reporting crimes. So this was discovered in a

00:25:43.160 --> 00:25:48.760
 report that's been carried out, I believe, from 2011 to 2016. They noticed that the crime rates have

00:25:48.760 --> 00:25:52.200
 gone down. They thought this is going great. But then they noticed that there were all these things

00:25:52.200 --> 00:25:56.360
 that were leading to the fact that no crimes were being reported. Amongst them were things like they

00:25:56.360 --> 00:26:01.720
 didn't say that something was a crime. They would say it was an unfounded thing. They would write to

00:26:01.720 --> 00:26:06.280
 the people who had reported crimes and say, "Just want to check that you actually did want to report

00:26:06.280 --> 00:26:10.600
 that crime. Let us know in the next seven days. If we don't hear back from you, we'll just assume

00:26:10.600 --> 00:26:15.560
 you didn't want to report that crime." And so as a result, they lowered it by huge amount. It was,

00:26:15.560 --> 00:26:20.680
 they discovered 22% of all the cases that were logged in the police force were using this method to

00:26:20.680 --> 00:26:25.800
 stop it from being reported as a crime. And the reason being is they were getting mounting pressure

00:26:25.800 --> 00:26:29.560
 from the government saying, "Your crime rates are so high. We need you to get them down." And they

00:26:29.560 --> 00:26:33.720
 went, "Well, there's a very quick way that we can do that." But did you see the other way they

00:26:33.720 --> 00:26:38.760
 tried to, Brisbane's in Queensland, right? Yeah. Okay, so this is another way they tried to cut down

00:26:38.760 --> 00:26:46.120
 an anti-social behaviour. Brisbane launched that, "Don't be a dickhead campaign." Apparently,

00:26:46.120 --> 00:26:52.840
 Queensland fortitude valley's police guy Simon Turner said, "Dickhead is a term that means your

00:26:52.840 --> 00:26:59.080
 behaviour is unacceptable." Oh, what? "You're either a decent bloke or a dickhead." Well, this

00:26:59.080 --> 00:27:08.200
 cast of very new lies on my school days, I must say. Yeah. And while this was happening, there was a

00:27:08.200 --> 00:27:14.520
 Queensland banana farm worker called Lee de Pau, and he tried to impress a girl by jumping into a river

00:27:14.520 --> 00:27:21.560
 after drinking about 10 cups of goon, which is like wine. Goon is boxed wine that comes in a,

00:27:21.560 --> 00:27:27.800
 what looks like alien tinfoil, okay, with a little thing, and then you press it. With a box outside it.

00:27:27.800 --> 00:27:31.960
 Yeah. But then you can, yeah, fit in your bag if you squeeze it in. That's not the important part of the

00:27:31.960 --> 00:27:37.480
 story, guys. We all know about boxed wine. What's going goon today? What you can do is when you finish it,

00:27:37.480 --> 00:27:42.200
 if you're very drunk, which I've done, as I'm Australian, you'll be out in a park on your own,

00:27:42.200 --> 00:27:46.280
 and you'll be like, "I'm really tired, and I've just finished my goon." You can actually blow into the

00:27:46.280 --> 00:27:52.920
 goon and blow it up like a pillow and then fall asleep on the, so it's a really practical drink,

00:27:52.920 --> 00:27:57.160
 actually. You can't do that on an empty bottle, for example. And they've never thought of that,

00:27:57.160 --> 00:28:01.160
 and they're marketing, and I think they definitely should. Very good point. Well, he could have blown it

00:28:01.160 --> 00:28:06.040
 up and used it as like water wings or something, because he jumped into this river to impress a girl

00:28:06.040 --> 00:28:12.440
 and was immediately mulled by a three-meter-long crocodile. I don't think water wings stop crocodiles.

00:28:12.440 --> 00:28:19.240
 Well, he managed to fight it off, but the lady who's trying to impress Sophie Patterson said,

00:28:19.240 --> 00:28:21.880
 "Being attacked by animals doesn't really do it for me."

00:28:21.880 --> 00:28:28.520
 Yeah. She's a weird one. She did say, "I'd have to be quite twisted to be impressed by that."

00:28:28.520 --> 00:28:35.720
 One of my favourite criminals of the year was he was in the balloon section,

00:28:35.720 --> 00:28:42.600
 and he was a man who was fined this year by a court in Canada for flying up in a chair with lots

00:28:42.600 --> 00:28:47.240
 of helium balloons attached to it. It's the real thing. He was inspired by the film "Up" and he did it

00:28:47.240 --> 00:28:52.200
 to promote his cleaning company. Another cartoon. Another cartoon? You was trying to fly high enough to see Steve.

00:28:52.200 --> 00:29:02.120
 And he flew up. He flew up 4,000 feet? He flew up 4 kilometers. So 4,000 meters.

00:29:02.120 --> 00:29:07.960
 And two commercial airliners flew underneath him while he was up in his chair. He landed safely.

00:29:07.960 --> 00:29:11.560
 He injured his ankle slightly on landing, but he was otherwise fine. And the court

00:29:11.560 --> 00:29:15.080
 fined him. They said he had been what was it? Unconsciously stupid. Unconsciously stupid, yeah.

00:29:15.080 --> 00:29:20.200
 But you can't agree with the court. I mean, you just read that story and you go,

00:29:20.200 --> 00:29:26.120
 "Wouldn't absolute hero." I know I should disapprove, but my god, that's cool.

00:29:26.120 --> 00:29:31.160
 This was my favourite crime story from the year. A used car dealership in Fort Worth and Dallas

00:29:31.160 --> 00:29:35.560
 was being robbed so many times. Just constantly getting robbed. The police weren't able to stop it.

00:29:35.560 --> 00:29:41.000
 That the guy who ran it, the owner, bought a guard dog. So he was like, "Great, guard dog here. Stop the

00:29:41.000 --> 00:29:45.160
 robbers. Did not stop the robbers. Robbers came back. Rob the place again. Then as they were leaving,

00:29:45.160 --> 00:29:53.320
 stole the guard dog with them." There was also a good, uh, similarly fitting crime. It was a news

00:29:53.320 --> 00:30:00.680
 crew had gone to cover the problem of urban crime in Albuquerque and the, as they left their fan,

00:30:00.680 --> 00:30:04.360
 where they had all their filming equipment and they went to film about urban crime and they came

00:30:04.360 --> 00:30:09.000
 back and they found all their stuff and it had been stolen. And so Michelle Donaldson, who was the

00:30:09.000 --> 00:30:13.960
 news director, said, "I have one rule that you should never be the lead story in your own news car."

00:30:13.960 --> 00:30:21.800
 This has violated that rule. And you went on a trek on the internet to find as many bandits as

00:30:21.800 --> 00:30:26.440
 you could, didn't you? Yeah. So you get people nicknamed the Such and Such Bandit because they robbed,

00:30:26.440 --> 00:30:31.320
 you know, a particular kind of place. So one example is the coast-to-coast bandit who only

00:30:31.320 --> 00:30:36.280
 robbed banks in New York and Los Angeles. Yes. And there was, what was there? There was the lunchtime

00:30:36.280 --> 00:30:43.560
 bandit who only robbed banks between noon and 1 p.m. and the bag trick bandit who kept putting his

00:30:43.560 --> 00:30:48.040
 hand in his pocket and pretending to have a gun. Well, he didn't have a gun. That was his clever trick.

00:30:48.040 --> 00:30:54.200
 The spelling bee bandit. Oh, the spelling bee bandit. He would pass a note to the cashier

00:30:54.200 --> 00:31:02.440
 in the bank saying, "This is a robbery." And this one probably doesn't need explaining, but it's

00:31:02.440 --> 00:31:11.880
 the Texas butthole tickling bandit. He was from Texas, I think. I knew you were going to read that one.

00:31:11.880 --> 00:31:18.680
 I liked one of my favourite criminals was in North Carolina. And so this was this year when a

00:31:18.680 --> 00:31:25.240
 500 million dollar opium-growing operation was busted. And it was when an investigator visited someone

00:31:25.240 --> 00:31:29.800
 on a completely unrelated matter, knocked on this guy's door. He was a farmer, knocked on his door.

00:31:29.800 --> 00:31:32.120
 And he opened the door and said, "I guess you're here about the opium."

00:31:32.120 --> 00:31:43.240
 Well, now. I really like this one. So when we decided that we were going to write this book,

00:31:43.240 --> 00:31:49.640
 we started this document between us and every week we started putting in sort of our favourite headlines

00:31:49.640 --> 00:31:54.200
 or little facts that we found. And to begin with, we didn't know if this would work as a book,

00:31:54.200 --> 00:31:59.640
 because we'd never done it before, we'd never tried. And I saw this one fact which was sent by James,

00:31:59.640 --> 00:32:03.720
 you put this into the document. And I thought, "Ah, this might actually work." And it was an arrest.

00:32:03.720 --> 00:32:08.440
 And it's under in the book Arrests Coma Human. Surprisingly, we have an entry which is a

00:32:08.440 --> 00:32:14.680
 arrest common non-human. A man in India this year was arrested for trying to create a fake ID card

00:32:14.680 --> 00:32:19.960
 using the name Osama Bin Laden. So he thought, "This will work. I'll just put Osama Bin Laden's name on

00:32:19.960 --> 00:32:25.720
 this." Not only that, he uploaded a blurred picture of Osama Bin Laden as the picture of his

00:32:25.720 --> 00:32:32.280
 ID card. So the police investigated and they arrested the man. The man, it turns out, his real name

00:32:32.280 --> 00:32:46.120
 is Saddam Hussein. Okay, that's it. That's all of our facts. Thank you so much for listening. If you

00:32:46.120 --> 00:32:50.040
