00:00:00,00:00:04,So the episode you're about to hear was recorded at the Cheltenham Literature Festival and every single
00:00:04,00:00:08,fact in it is from the book. So it will give you a good idea about what you're going to be buying.
00:00:08,00:00:10,It was an awesome gig. Hope you enjoy.
00:00:25,00:00:31,"Hello and welcome to another episode of No Such Thing as a Fish, a weekly podcast this week"
00:00:31,00:00:34,coming to you from the Cheltenham Literature Festival.
00:00:34,00:00:42,"My name is Dan Schreiber. I'm sitting here with Anna Chazinski, Andrew Huntamari, and James"
00:00:42,00:00:46,"Harkin. And once again, we have gathered around the microphones with our four favorite facts"
00:00:46,00:00:52,"from the last seven days. And in no particular order, here we go. Starting with you, Chazinski."
00:00:52,00:00:59,"My fact this week is that this year the phrase ""Make America Great Again"" adorned half a million hats"
00:00:59,00:01:01,and one a-ness.
00:01:01,00:01:10,"That is legally contentious, as a way of describing the president."
00:01:10,00:01:20,"So this is, of course, the MAGA caps. If you weren't living in a cave, the MAGA appeared on lots of"
00:01:20,00:01:29,"caps that were sold throughout America, but also LGBTQ performance artist Abel Azcona had himself"
00:01:29,00:01:37,"tattooed, stenciled on the bottom, with ""Make America Great Again"" with the MAGA. And he said it was"
00:01:37,00:01:43,"an a subversive action. So he said, ""The anus is a land of pleasure and a terrarium of empowerment"
00:01:43,00:01:48,"for many."" I didn't know. A terrarium terrarium is very unusual. I thought a terrarium was where"
00:01:48,00:01:55,"you kept ants. No, that's a formicarium. A terrarium is where you keep snakes and things like that."
00:01:55,00:02:00,"Oh right, okay. That's much better right. Is it why you keep... Shoddy, it's just a place it's"
00:02:00,00:02:06,"full of earth. I mean, we already is vexed, it's the point of time."
00:02:06,00:02:13,So he concluded that writing a fascist political motto like that is what is not mine.
00:02:13,00:02:19,"""In my anus"" is a clearly critical and subversive action, so that's what's in it. The anus is what you're"
00:02:19,00:02:25,"saying. Oh god. I think it was... It was a lot to know this, Andy. It was a possibility. It could be"
00:02:25,00:02:30,"surrounding. Yeah, that's what that was. Yeah, as well. He did say it in, but I think it's on the edge."
00:02:30,00:02:35,"Inside? No, come on. You don't write the word polo inside the mint. You write it around the..."
00:02:35,00:02:42,"So what's interesting about this guy is that he's done it, but he doesn't regress it. And we"
00:02:42,00:02:48,read a story last year about a guy called Joshua who done a similar thing. He was a big fan of Bernie
00:02:48,00:02:53,"Sanders, but he did regret his tattoo, which was a tattoo on his penis, which said feel the burn."
00:02:53,00:02:59,"And then he did that in the primaries, and then Hillary got it, and he was like, oh, I have made a"
00:02:59,00:03:05,"terrible mistake. This is still 2020, isn't it? That's true. So do you know,"
00:03:05,00:03:12,"make America great again was actually Ronald Reagan's campaign slogan? Or his was not exactly the same,"
00:03:12,00:03:18,"his was let's make America great again. And also his next phrase, he's already worked out what"
00:03:18,00:03:25,"it'll be in 2020. Really? Yeah, he's going to go for keep America great exclamation point. That's"
00:03:25,00:03:32,"what he says. But unfortunately, that's already taken by a horror movie. It's in purge election"
00:03:32,00:03:37,"year, which is a movie that came out last year. Wow. So he's not allowed to use it? Well, I think he will"
00:03:37,00:03:45,anyway. Could he put maybe a question mark on the end instead of something? Yeah. He did really
00:03:45,00:03:50,"specifically say the exclamation point when they asked him about it. Did he? Well, he said the words"
00:03:50,00:03:55,"exclamation point, or he just said it like he says stuff. I mean, it's such, three years is such a long"
00:03:55,00:04:00,"time in politics, isn't it? I think we can, you know, we don't know if that'll be the slogan. He"
00:04:00,00:04:04,"might change it to something realistic, like let us fight the cockroaches among the Radio Act."
00:04:04,00:04:15,"He did get, he got in another legal copyright dispute. I mean, he has a lot of lawsuits all the time,"
00:04:15,00:04:21,"but there was one lawsuit that Trump got involved in, which was over an app for the iPhone,"
00:04:21,00:04:29,"and the app was called iTrump, okay? So it was, and it was against a trumpet teacher, an"
00:04:29,00:04:34,"amateur musician. He's a 40-year-old guy called Thomas Schaffeld, and they had this, I think,"
00:04:34,00:04:39,"a six-year legal battle where Schaffeld represented himself in court against all of Trump's lawyers,"
00:04:39,00:04:44,and he won. So the eye Trump now belongs to this trumpet guy. Awesome. Yeah. Have you ever heard of
00:04:44,00:04:49,"Eddie Trump? No. I don't know how to describe this guy, but so there's this Per Brothers, real estate"
00:04:49,00:04:56,developers called the Trump Brothers. One of them's Eddie Trump in 2013 ABC News had a list of the
00:04:56,00:05:02,top 50 most influential ultra-high net worth individuals. There was one Trump on it. It was Eddie
00:05:02,00:05:09,"Trump bizarrely, but in the 1980s, they had this real estate company, and Donald Trump found out"
00:05:09,00:05:13,"about it when he received a letter accidentally sent to him, which was meant for Eddie Trump,"
00:05:13,00:05:18,"and so he spent the next many years trying to sue them for using the Trump name, his own name"
00:05:18,00:05:23,"on their business, despite them being called the Trumps. And he lost that case, but that's amazing."
00:05:23,00:05:28,"Simmer. One of my favorite Trump stories from this year, and it's made it into the book"
00:05:28,00:05:34,"under the title ""Protests, Non-Dirty,"" because we have a dirty protest section."
00:05:34,00:05:42,"Is that a US cabinet member, who's Wilbur Ross, praised Donald Trump's trip to Saudi Arabia,"
00:05:42,00:05:47,saying it was so successful that there wasn't a single protestor failing to recognize that
00:05:47,00:05:53,"protesting is illegal in Saudi Arabia. And he was on a TV show talking about it,"
00:05:53,00:05:57,saying it was fascinating. There was not one bad guy with a bad placard standing there doing
00:05:57,00:06:02,"anything, and when the reporter said, ""Yeah, but that's because he would go to jail for up to 15"
00:06:02,00:06:06,"years if he was standing doing that."" In theory, that could be true. Yeah, yeah. But really,"
00:06:06,00:06:12,"it was amazing. Just no one was there. Well, he's not had the best time abroad,"
00:06:12,00:06:17,"has he Trump. He went to the G20, and he was sat next to it one of the dinners, the first lady"
00:06:17,00:06:22,of Japan. And he said it was quite tough to sit next to her because she didn't speak any English.
00:06:22,00:06:26,"The problem is, if you go on the internet, you can look at videos of her and she speaks perfect English."
00:06:26,00:06:37,"So just completely affected. Amazing. There was one line of his, which I think encapsulated a lot"
00:06:37,00:06:45,"of the whole presidency so far. This was something that Dan found. He said, he was interviewed and he said,"
00:06:45,00:06:50,"""I think we've had the most successful 13 weeks in the history of the presidency."" Unfortunately,"
00:06:50,00:06:59,"he said that only 11 weeks into his presidency. Actually, we wrote an article in the book on the"
00:06:59,00:07:03,"inauguration, and we did it in numbers because that was obviously the big thing where he said,"
00:07:03,00:07:09,"""Biggest inauguration ever, period."" And Andy did this whole article about the many little numbers"
00:07:09,00:07:14,"that didn't get reported. Do you have any examples? Yes. Oh, what was this? So the crowd was meant"
00:07:14,00:07:19,"to be 1.5 million, and actually it was worked out at three to six hundred thousand, which is still"
00:07:19,00:07:24,"a lot of people. What, you mean three hundred thousand to six hundred thousand? Sorry, I don't mean"
00:07:24,00:07:32,"minimum three maximum six hundred thousand. What else was there? There were, oh, things,"
00:07:32,00:07:37,the number of cans of ravioli. Ravioli that were confiscated by security for being a potential
00:07:37,00:07:43,"risk to presidential security, which that was two. What was the thing about Don's John's?"
00:07:43,00:07:49,"Oh, yeah, all the, all the porters for the crowds who turned up were brought by a company, which is"
00:07:49,00:07:55,"genuinely called Don's John's, and they feared that people might make jokes about this, so they covered"
00:07:55,00:08:00,all the labels up with blue tape on the day. So it's got a thin skinned ring. And they also confiscated
00:08:00,00:08:07,"from people coming into the inauguration bananas. So if you had a banana, it wasn't allowed in unless"
00:08:07,00:08:11,"it was sliced. So they would say, ""May I see your lunchbox?"" I'm sorry, that bananas in full form."
00:08:11,00:08:18,"So another thing that Trump said that people, according to question this year, was that he invented"
00:08:18,00:08:24,"the phrase priming the pump. Do people remember that? So he used the phrase priming the pump, and then he"
00:08:24,00:08:29,"said, have you heard that expression before because I haven't heard it? I mean, I just made it up a"
00:08:29,00:08:34,"couple of days ago. That's just the kind of thing I have to do. And of course, he didn't make it up,"
00:08:34,00:08:41,"it dates back to 1819, I think, in a Walter Scott story, which then I ended up reading in preparation"
00:08:41,00:08:46,"for this. It's great, but Walter Scott's actually talking about a woman who comes up to him at a party"
00:08:46,00:08:51,"and says to him, ""I really loved your latest book, but he'd written it under a pseudonym."" So she was"
00:08:51,00:08:56,"actually bragging to him and saying, ""Haha, I've got you. I know it's you."" And so he's talking about"
00:08:56,00:09:00,"how annoyed he is that she's trying to prime the pump with flattery. But yeah, he also"
00:09:00,00:09:06,"claimed this week, I think, or last week, to have invented fake news. I think I'd give him that."
00:09:06,00:09:12,"No, it was even just the word fake because he didn't get to news. So I think he did meet"
00:09:12,00:09:17,"mean fake news, but he's sitting next to Pence in it, and that's the best bit because he says,"
00:09:17,00:09:20,"""No, many people know. I invented the word fake."" And Pence is like, ""Yeah, he did."""
00:09:22,00:09:27,"He's such a good best friend. He's so good. It's not done him too much harm. So, for example,"
00:09:27,00:09:34,"since the election, at least two babies in Iraq have been named Trump. So he's got that."
00:09:34,00:09:38,That's a take away. They're going to go through life answering questions about that.
00:09:38,00:09:44,"Well, here's an interesting thing. I went to Kosovo quite a few years ago, and I was told while I was"
00:09:44,00:09:49,"out there that a popular name that was happening amongst boys in Kosovo, new names,"
00:09:49,00:09:57,"was Tonneblur, T-O-N-B-L-R, and it's a tribute to Tony Blair because of the, I think there's a Bill"
00:09:57,00:10:03,"Clinton, Bill of Adela, Christina. There's Clinton up on buildings everywhere you went. There was"
00:10:03,00:10:09,"pictures of Clinton, and Tonneblur is a name in Kosovo now. But the problem is with Donald is"
00:10:09,00:10:13,"no one's been called Donald anymore. Oh, that's true. I think there were only something like two"
00:10:13,00:10:21,"babies called Donald in Scotland, even last year. Even in Scotland? No, it's the home of Donald."
00:10:21,00:10:26,"It's the home of the Donald. Because it's in Scotland, where can you? And apparently they did an"
00:10:26,00:10:29,"interview with a guy who was called Donald, and he said he had to apologise every time he went to"
00:10:29,00:10:37,Starbucks. But that's because he took a poo on the account. Why did he apologise? Because they say
00:10:37,00:10:44,"what's your name? And he goes, ""Donald, sorry."" And so he's saying about Scotland, Donald Trump has"
00:10:44,00:10:50,"some golf courses in Scotland. And for one of those, he wanted to have a crest for his family."
00:10:50,00:10:56,"So what he did was he took an English crest and stole it and put the word ""Trump"" at the bottom"
00:10:56,00:10:59,"in place of the word that was there before that, which was integrity."
00:11:03,00:11:07,"We're going to have to move on to our second fact, because we're running on a tighter podcast schedule"
00:11:07,00:11:13,"tonight. So we're going to move on to our second fact now, and that is James. Okay, my fact this"
00:11:13,00:11:19,week is that East Enderstar Adam Woodjatt was beaten in the London marathon this year by a man
00:11:19,00:11:26,"in a sleeping bag, a woman in a full-body dinosaur suit, and a man carrying a tumble dryer."
00:11:30,00:11:37,"So he did the course in seven hours and four minutes, which is... Is that slow? It's quite slow, yeah."
00:11:37,00:11:40,Okay. They reckon one of the reasons might have been because he was doing so many selfies on the way.
00:11:40,00:11:46,"Okay. But yeah, there were 73 world records attempted at this year's London marathon,"
00:11:46,00:11:53,"and 39 were broken. So this sleeping bag was broken, the dinosaur was broken. The fastest marathon"
00:11:53,00:11:59,"ever run by someone dressed as a witch was broken. That was by Nicola Nothol from Pendle,"
00:11:59,00:12:05,"and she thought she'd broken the record last year, but they nullified her results because her skirt"
00:12:05,00:12:11,"was too short. Oh, yeah. Apparently witches have to have a certain length of skirt."
00:12:11,00:12:15,"Did not know that, yeah. How sure was Adam Woodjatt's skirt."
00:12:15,00:12:22,"He's, I bet, I mean, are there any East Ender's fans in here except me? No, wow, not a single one."
00:12:22,00:12:26,"No overlap between shot and the cherry festival, and East Enders fail."
00:12:26,00:12:29,"I owe a lot of, like, him and Dale fans to me. Yeah, you're right. Well, he's always doing embarrassing"
00:12:29,00:12:33,"stuff in East Enders, so this just fits with his character. Maybe it was a bit of method acting."
00:12:33,00:12:37,"No, I'd never really heard of Adam Woodjatt before this, but he's like the right person."
00:12:37,00:12:39,He's like the right person. He's like the right person. He's like the right person.
00:12:39,00:12:42,"Yeah, he did. Oh my god. I have a question about the sleeping bag person."
00:12:42,00:12:48,"Yes. Did the sleeping bag person run it with the sleeping bag on this way, or this way?"
00:12:48,00:12:51,"Oh, sorry. I should clarify for people listening to this because it's an audio thing."
00:12:53,00:12:59,"The thing is, how many ways are there? You said this way. No one's a home gang while there's"
00:12:59,00:13:06,"at least six ways. Sorry, okay. I reckon, and I don't know this, but I reckon it must have been like"
00:13:06,00:13:12,"this way. Oh, I see. Yeah, I think about it. That makes most sense. You're right."
00:13:12,00:13:17,"I think, like, one of the sac races. Yeah, but I think I would run faster. If I unzipped it a bit"
00:13:17,00:13:22,"the legs and headed on over my head with some eye holes. Eye holes, but you can't have eye holes."
00:13:22,00:13:27,"It's world record. Oh, sorry. Is that cheating? I think so. It compromised the sleeping bag, I guess."
00:13:27,00:13:33,"Yeah, and some other records, Beaton, the fastest marathon as someone dressed as a swimmer,"
00:13:33,00:13:38,"a star, a crustacean, an elf, a fast food item, and a toilet roll."
00:13:38,00:13:45,Stressed as a swimmer? That was the least effort I've ever had anyone put into a costume.
00:13:45,00:13:48,It'd be great when he passed the starfish in the crustacean because he could just make it look like
00:13:48,00:13:53,"he's even under water. Yeah, did he have to act out like he was swimming? No, he just wore"
00:13:53,00:13:58,"trunks. Right. Yeah, that's not, if anything, that should be faster than the runners because he's"
00:13:58,00:14:03,"got less air resistance. He should have won the actual marathon. What's amazing as well is,"
00:14:03,00:14:09,none of these are set new records. These are all broke existing records. So there must be a massive
00:14:09,00:14:13,"list somewhere where people are going, I really want a record. What do I need to do? I can dress"
00:14:13,00:14:18,"as a giant hot dog. Okay, I'll go and I'll try and smash that one this year. So that's all they've"
00:14:18,00:14:23,"done, right? Yeah, I guess you're right. What about this tumble dry guy? Oh, well, he was, I can't"
00:14:23,00:14:30,"remember his name, it's in the book. He basically decided he wanted to carry an item of kitchen equipment"
00:14:30,00:14:35,"and it was allowed to be any of them, but he tried originally with a fridge, I think. See, I would"
00:14:35,00:14:42,have gone spatula. I would have immediately. He tried with a fridge and then decided it wasn't
00:14:42,00:14:46,really working because it was too big and then went with the tumble dryer. And apparently in his
00:14:46,00:14:51,"hometown, he was practicing and he kept being stopped by the police. I thought he was the world's"
00:14:51,00:15:01,most brazen thief. The great one is the gorilla. I'm sure you guys see the guy who did the marathon
00:15:01,00:15:06,"as a gorilla. He was a policeman, must he? Yeah, yeah, that's right. So he completed it by walking"
00:15:06,00:15:12,as a gorilla and it took him. He didn't walk as a gorilla. He was like on his hands and knees.
00:15:12,00:15:15,"He was on his hands and knees. He was quoted because he was stopped halfway through the race,"
00:15:15,00:15:20,"or along the race, asking any advice for anyone who wants to travel as a gorilla in a marathon"
00:15:20,00:15:25,in future. And his quotes is get a bit more training in. We only did about four crawling sessions
00:15:25,00:15:30,"beforehand. I'd also recommend painkillers and bloody mindedness. Anyway, I'd better get crawling."
00:15:30,00:15:35,"He even wants to be in the confiscated as bananas at the entrance, isn't he?"
00:15:35,00:15:42,"He was even slower than Adam Witt, yeah, wasn't he? He was like, was it six days?"
00:15:42,00:15:47,"He takes six days and eight, six and a half days? Yeah, that's a lot slower than Adam Witt."
00:15:47,00:15:54,"He wasn't there for a week. No, you're right. But I think in order to get a medal, you need to do"
00:15:54,00:16:00,it in something like six hours. So he was only six days out of getting a medal. But there is a lot
00:16:00,00:16:05,"of spot in this book, isn't it? There is. I was going to say, can I quickly read out my favorite"
00:16:05,00:16:11,"sport fact from this book? This is a fact that was found from James, found by James. And that is"
00:16:11,00:16:18,"a non-leg footballer and Aberdeen missed the goal so badly that they found the ball 1,800 kilometers"
00:16:18,00:16:26,away in Norway. So his shot went past the goal. It went into the river D and it just went into the
00:16:26,00:16:33,"North Sea and it just floated away. And then ages later, because for the fact that they had the name"
00:16:33,00:16:39,"of their team on the ball, they got an email from a small island off the coast of Norway called"
00:16:39,00:16:47,"Vanna, who said, we've got your ball. And so they returned it and they have the ball back again."
00:16:47,00:16:52,"That's so sweet. There was actually this week, there was a fifth league football match in Romania"
00:16:52,00:16:57,that had to be called off before it finished because all of the spare balls ended up in the river.
00:16:57,00:17:00,So they had a dozen spare balls and then they had to finish it. It was something like the 58th
00:17:00,00:17:05,minute or something. They had to end the match because they didn't only balls left. So these things
00:17:05,00:17:11,"happened. It's not playing by rivers or seas. We should move on to our next fact again,"
00:17:11,00:17:18,like in Titish. So we're going to move on to fact number 3 and that is Andy. My fact is that the
00:17:18,00:17:26,"Queen's nickname is Gary. Is that your personal nickname for her? No, it's even better. It's a family"
00:17:26,00:17:32,nickname for the Queen. So this was something we found out this year and it's something that Prince
00:17:32,00:17:39,William called her when he was a child because he was unable to pronounce Grammy. So he would call
00:17:39,00:17:47,her Gary instead. I just think that's very sweet. Apparently Prince Philip calls her Cabbage.
00:17:47,00:17:55,"Oh, okay. Do we know why? He can't pronounce Elizabeth. She just comes out like that."
00:17:55,00:17:59,"He retired this year, didn't he? That's in the book. Oh yeah, we wrote about that. So he"
00:17:59,00:18:05,"retired this year and it's been a huge disappointment to this one small island at Vanuatu, an island"
00:18:05,00:18:11,called Tanner because the people who revere him as a god have been waiting five decades for him to
00:18:11,00:18:16,"come and he's now no longer coming. So they're devastated. It's really, really bad news over there."
00:18:16,00:18:20,They must have seen it coming when the clock ticked over on the fourth decade.
00:18:20,00:18:27,"Yeah, he's a god. He's a god. He's still retired, are they? I guess not. No. Apparently one of the"
00:18:27,00:18:34,things about that is if he and the Queen ever went to this island and the Queen ever witnessed him
00:18:34,00:18:39,"publicly drinking Carver, the local drink, then local etiquette dictates that she would have to be"
00:18:39,00:18:44,instantly executed by a single blow to the head with a vegetable.
00:18:44,00:18:53,"Well, we found out another nickname, whose nickname was it? Oh, Camilla, Parker Bowles. That's right."
00:18:53,00:18:59,The Duchess of Cornwall. The Duchess of Cornwall. She said that her nickname at school was the
00:18:59,00:19:15,"growler because... I expected more from you. Because she was so bad at singing, is the reason. Sean"
00:19:15,00:19:22,Spicer was once called Sean Sphinxer. I think he was called that when he was at uni and one of the
00:19:22,00:19:27,"University magazine called him Sean Sphinxer and then he got very, very upset and they said it was just"
00:19:27,00:19:33,"a totally innocent auto-correct, but... I don't think auto-correct kind of existed when Spicer was at"
00:19:33,00:19:43,"university. No, and also Spicer is a word, isn't it? This is a great one. This was a scientific paper"
00:19:43,00:19:48,published this year. This is just to do with names. There was a paper published about the evolution
00:19:48,00:19:52,"of the horse hoof, talking about the number of toes it used to have because it now has one toe and"
00:19:52,00:20:00,it used to have more. The lead writer of that paper is called Brianna McHorse. McHorse is a surname.
00:20:00,00:20:05,"She sounds like she was named by the internet, doesn't she? Yeah, she does. She's a Bodie McBoch Horse,"
00:20:05,00:20:11,"she's... Yeah, that's true. This is like, so Canada got a new national bird. This is in the books"
00:20:11,00:20:16,"I think it was last year. So Canada's new national bird is the Grey J, but the person who set up the"
00:20:16,00:20:22,campaign for them to get a new national bird was called Professor David Bird. That's good. That
00:20:22,00:20:28,"reminds me, there's a tennis player who's currently playing. He's a tennis player from Tennessee,"
00:20:28,00:20:37,"and he's called tennis. No. He's called tennis Sandgren, okay? And on Wikipedia it says, ""Although tennis"
00:20:37,00:20:43,"Sandgren is a tennis player from Tennessee, he is actually named after his great-grandfather,"
00:20:43,00:20:53,"who did not play tennis and was not from Tennessee."" James, you found out about the names of the year."
00:20:53,00:20:59,"Oh, I love those guys. Yeah. There's an online competition every year to find the best-named person,"
00:20:59,00:21:05,"and it's all real people from all over the world and it's done by an online vote, and I'm sure you"
00:21:05,00:21:11,"have some of them. Well, I know that the winner was Boats Boats. Yep. Have you just said to James,"
00:21:11,00:21:15,"you found out about the names of the year, and then relied on him? No, I've got them here. I don't"
00:21:15,00:21:20,"want to take credit for them. Well, let me say the people who Boats Boats beat to get to the final."
00:21:20,00:21:27,"He beat Eliza Fox Teats, Bird Love God, Aphrodite Bodycomb,"
00:21:27,00:21:32,"Quinterius Monday, and Andy Brandy, Casa Grande."
00:21:32,00:21:41,"But we've actually, as we were writing this book, we've come across loads of better names,"
00:21:41,00:21:45,"even than those, haven't we? Yeah, yeah. I really like this is one that's under the entry, Kinky."
00:21:45,00:21:52,"This is further down, but just for the sake of knowing, Europe opened its first sex doll brothel"
00:21:52,00:22:00,"this year, and it has a staff of four dolls and stuff, just letting you know it's in the book."
00:22:00,00:22:05,"But in that article, in the Kinky article, I found this year that there's a cop in America"
00:22:05,00:22:10,who was suspended from the force after it was discovered that her previous occupation was a
00:22:10,00:22:17,"dominatrix, and that's what she did. And her name is Officer Hyman, that's her name. And she was told"
00:22:17,00:22:21,she could stay on on the condition that she passed a psychiatric exam to prove she wasn't prone to
00:22:21,00:22:30,using excessive force. Did you guys see Tatler released a list of poshest baby names in the last
00:22:30,00:22:36,"couple of weeks? It was bizarre. So, hey, it shows weird self-awareness of Tatler to say these are"
00:22:36,00:22:41,"the poshest names. We know about this, if we know about anything. And it said for girls, it said,"
00:22:41,00:22:47,"these are real names, we promise, with no evidence to back that up. But it said for girls, best names"
00:22:47,00:22:54,"you can name your kid are Scar, Zaza, Figgy or Monovine. And then for boys, you could call your son"
00:22:54,00:23:00,"Barclay Mow, which probably presumably I've run it. I'm chairman. I guess so. Well, you wouldn't"
00:23:00,00:23:09,"call him chairman, would you? Other names they recommend for a boy, Wigbert? Wigbert? Yeah, so maybe"
00:23:09,00:23:16,"rethink your exorias, quail and Peter, but starting with an N, but the N is silent. Okay."
00:23:16,00:23:25,"I've got another one, which is that this is under the entry Northern Lights in the book,"
00:23:25,00:23:30,"and we found this amazing thing. It was found in the middle of last year, but it's been debated"
00:23:30,00:23:34,"about since last year, up until this year, and they finally announced that they finally know what"
00:23:34,00:23:39,it is. So they thought that this was a part of the Aurora Borealis for years. It was a light
00:23:39,00:23:43,"phenomenon that was happening in the sky, thought it was just a part of the Northern Lights."
00:23:43,00:23:47,"And there's a Facebook group of Aurora Spodders who kept looking at it going, I'm not sure that this"
00:23:47,00:23:52,"is the Aurora Borealis. And it turns out they were right, that it was this amazing new light"
00:23:52,00:23:57,"phenomenon that's been there since, you know, since we've had eyes and seen things. Maybe even"
00:23:57,00:24:05,"before that. Maybe even before, but actually, that's a good point, yeah. Yeah. So just like two days before"
00:24:05,00:24:12,"we had eyes, that started. And so that's incredible. Unfortunately, it has been named by the public,"
00:24:12,00:24:21,"so it's now called Steve. Get some beautiful Steve's. Yeah, come on. And they tried to backtrack it"
00:24:21,00:24:25,"to say, oh, that it has a real scientific name. So what they said that it might stand for is strong"
00:24:25,00:24:31,"thermal emission velocity enhancement. But actually, it's named after a cartoon called Over the"
00:24:31,00:24:38,"Hedge, which is a sort of animation for kids. And it's a talking squirrel who names a hedge Steve."
00:24:38,00:24:42,And that's why it's got its name. I think just don't ask the public to name things.
00:24:42,00:24:51,"Don't ask the public, yeah. There was a orangutan with white fur. It was found this year in Bonio."
00:24:51,00:24:55,And they asked the public to name that. It's the first albino orangutan that these guys have ever
00:24:55,00:25:00,"found. And the public actually came up with a decent name, which was alba meaning white, which is"
00:25:00,00:25:06,"quite good. They sensibly ignored other suggestions, such as meringue u tab."
00:25:06,00:25:17,I stand by my decision to submit this. And a rang no tab.
00:25:21,00:25:27,"Which is really good. All right, we're going to have to move on to our final fact of the show."
00:25:27,00:25:34,"This is my fact, and this is under Queensland, Australian Queensland police successfully lowered"
00:25:34,00:25:43,crime rates this year by asking victims to stop reporting crimes. So this was discovered in a
00:25:43,00:25:48,"report that's been carried out, I believe, from 2011 to 2016. They noticed that the crime rates have"
00:25:48,00:25:52,gone down. They thought this is going great. But then they noticed that there were all these things
00:25:52,00:25:56,that were leading to the fact that no crimes were being reported. Amongst them were things like they
00:25:56,00:26:01,didn't say that something was a crime. They would say it was an unfounded thing. They would write to
00:26:01,00:26:06,"the people who had reported crimes and say, ""Just want to check that you actually did want to report"
00:26:06,00:26:10,"that crime. Let us know in the next seven days. If we don't hear back from you, we'll just assume"
00:26:10,00:26:15,"you didn't want to report that crime."" And so as a result, they lowered it by huge amount. It was,"
00:26:15,00:26:20,they discovered 22% of all the cases that were logged in the police force were using this method to
00:26:20,00:26:25,stop it from being reported as a crime. And the reason being is they were getting mounting pressure
00:26:25,00:26:29,"from the government saying, ""Your crime rates are so high. We need you to get them down."" And they"
00:26:29,00:26:33,"went, ""Well, there's a very quick way that we can do that."" But did you see the other way they"
00:26:33,00:26:38,"tried to, Brisbane's in Queensland, right? Yeah. Okay, so this is another way they tried to cut down"
00:26:38,00:26:46,"an anti-social behaviour. Brisbane launched that, ""Don't be a dickhead campaign."" Apparently,"
00:26:46,00:26:52,"Queensland fortitude valley's police guy Simon Turner said, ""Dickhead is a term that means your"
00:26:52,00:26:59,"behaviour is unacceptable."" Oh, what? ""You're either a decent bloke or a dickhead."" Well, this"
00:26:59,00:27:08,"cast of very new lies on my school days, I must say. Yeah. And while this was happening, there was a"
00:27:08,00:27:14,"Queensland banana farm worker called Lee de Pau, and he tried to impress a girl by jumping into a river"
00:27:14,00:27:21,"after drinking about 10 cups of goon, which is like wine. Goon is boxed wine that comes in a,"
00:27:21,00:27:27,"what looks like alien tinfoil, okay, with a little thing, and then you press it. With a box outside it."
00:27:27,00:27:31,"Yeah. But then you can, yeah, fit in your bag if you squeeze it in. That's not the important part of the"
00:27:31,00:27:37,"story, guys. We all know about boxed wine. What's going goon today? What you can do is when you finish it,"
00:27:37,00:27:42,"if you're very drunk, which I've done, as I'm Australian, you'll be out in a park on your own,"
00:27:42,00:27:46,"and you'll be like, ""I'm really tired, and I've just finished my goon."" You can actually blow into the"
00:27:46,00:27:52,"goon and blow it up like a pillow and then fall asleep on the, so it's a really practical drink,"
00:27:52,00:27:57,"actually. You can't do that on an empty bottle, for example. And they've never thought of that,"
00:27:57,00:28:01,"and they're marketing, and I think they definitely should. Very good point. Well, he could have blown it"
00:28:01,00:28:06,"up and used it as like water wings or something, because he jumped into this river to impress a girl"
00:28:06,00:28:12,and was immediately mulled by a three-meter-long crocodile. I don't think water wings stop crocodiles.
00:28:12,00:28:19,"Well, he managed to fight it off, but the lady who's trying to impress Sophie Patterson said,"
00:28:19,00:28:21,"""Being attacked by animals doesn't really do it for me."""
00:28:21,00:28:28,"Yeah. She's a weird one. She did say, ""I'd have to be quite twisted to be impressed by that."""
00:28:28,00:28:35,"One of my favourite criminals of the year was he was in the balloon section,"
00:28:35,00:28:42,and he was a man who was fined this year by a court in Canada for flying up in a chair with lots
00:28:42,00:28:47,"of helium balloons attached to it. It's the real thing. He was inspired by the film ""Up"" and he did it"
00:28:47,00:28:52,to promote his cleaning company. Another cartoon. Another cartoon? You was trying to fly high enough to see Steve.
00:28:52,00:29:02,"And he flew up. He flew up 4,000 feet? He flew up 4 kilometers. So 4,000 meters."
00:29:02,00:29:07,And two commercial airliners flew underneath him while he was up in his chair. He landed safely.
00:29:07,00:29:11,"He injured his ankle slightly on landing, but he was otherwise fine. And the court"
00:29:11,00:29:15,"fined him. They said he had been what was it? Unconsciously stupid. Unconsciously stupid, yeah."
00:29:15,00:29:20,"But you can't agree with the court. I mean, you just read that story and you go,"
00:29:20,00:29:26,"""Wouldn't absolute hero."" I know I should disapprove, but my god, that's cool."
00:29:26,00:29:31,This was my favourite crime story from the year. A used car dealership in Fort Worth and Dallas
00:29:31,00:29:35,was being robbed so many times. Just constantly getting robbed. The police weren't able to stop it.
00:29:35,00:29:41,"That the guy who ran it, the owner, bought a guard dog. So he was like, ""Great, guard dog here. Stop the"
00:29:41,00:29:45,"robbers. Did not stop the robbers. Robbers came back. Rob the place again. Then as they were leaving,"
00:29:45,00:29:53,"stole the guard dog with them."" There was also a good, uh, similarly fitting crime. It was a news"
00:29:53,00:30:00,"crew had gone to cover the problem of urban crime in Albuquerque and the, as they left their fan,"
00:30:00,00:30:04,where they had all their filming equipment and they went to film about urban crime and they came
00:30:04,00:30:09,"back and they found all their stuff and it had been stolen. And so Michelle Donaldson, who was the"
00:30:09,00:30:13,"news director, said, ""I have one rule that you should never be the lead story in your own news car."""
00:30:13,00:30:21,This has violated that rule. And you went on a trek on the internet to find as many bandits as
00:30:21,00:30:26,"you could, didn't you? Yeah. So you get people nicknamed the Such and Such Bandit because they robbed,"
00:30:26,00:30:31,"you know, a particular kind of place. So one example is the coast-to-coast bandit who only"
00:30:31,00:30:36,"robbed banks in New York and Los Angeles. Yes. And there was, what was there? There was the lunchtime"
00:30:36,00:30:43,bandit who only robbed banks between noon and 1 p.m. and the bag trick bandit who kept putting his
00:30:43,00:30:48,"hand in his pocket and pretending to have a gun. Well, he didn't have a gun. That was his clever trick."
00:30:48,00:30:54,"The spelling bee bandit. Oh, the spelling bee bandit. He would pass a note to the cashier"
00:30:54,00:31:02,"in the bank saying, ""This is a robbery."" And this one probably doesn't need explaining, but it's"
00:31:02,00:31:11,"the Texas butthole tickling bandit. He was from Texas, I think. I knew you were going to read that one."
00:31:11,00:31:18,I liked one of my favourite criminals was in North Carolina. And so this was this year when a
00:31:18,00:31:25,500 million dollar opium-growing operation was busted. And it was when an investigator visited someone
00:31:25,00:31:29,"on a completely unrelated matter, knocked on this guy's door. He was a farmer, knocked on his door."
00:31:29,00:31:32,"And he opened the door and said, ""I guess you're here about the opium."""
00:31:32,00:31:43,"Well, now. I really like this one. So when we decided that we were going to write this book,"
00:31:43,00:31:49,we started this document between us and every week we started putting in sort of our favourite headlines
00:31:49,00:31:54,"or little facts that we found. And to begin with, we didn't know if this would work as a book,"
00:31:54,00:31:59,"because we'd never done it before, we'd never tried. And I saw this one fact which was sent by James,"
00:31:59,00:32:03,"you put this into the document. And I thought, ""Ah, this might actually work."" And it was an arrest."
00:32:03,00:32:08,"And it's under in the book Arrests Coma Human. Surprisingly, we have an entry which is a"
00:32:08,00:32:14,arrest common non-human. A man in India this year was arrested for trying to create a fake ID card
00:32:14,00:32:19,"using the name Osama Bin Laden. So he thought, ""This will work. I'll just put Osama Bin Laden's name on"
00:32:19,00:32:25,"this."" Not only that, he uploaded a blurred picture of Osama Bin Laden as the picture of his"
00:32:25,00:32:32,"ID card. So the police investigated and they arrested the man. The man, it turns out, his real name"
00:32:32,00:32:46,"is Saddam Hussein. Okay, that's it. That's all of our facts. Thank you so much for listening. If you"
00:32:46,00:32:50,"would like to get in contact with us about the things that we've said over the course of this podcast,"
