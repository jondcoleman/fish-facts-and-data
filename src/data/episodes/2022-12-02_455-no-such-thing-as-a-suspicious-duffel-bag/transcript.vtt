00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.880
 Hi everyone, welcome to this week's episode of No Such Things as a Fish.

00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:09.180
 I have three things to share with you very, very quickly before we start this week's

00:00:09.180 --> 00:00:15.680
 show and I will give them to you in reverse order of how much you embrace capitalism.

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:22.680
 So first of all, if you go to nosuchthingsafish.com you will find that we have merch.

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:25.360
 We have a whole new range of merchandise.

00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:29.760
 There is a tour book, which was originally only available on tour, it's got loads of

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:33.000
 stuff about the history of fish made lovingly by Alex Bell.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:38.440
 There are pretty much the nerdiest t-shirts you've ever seen and there are pin badges.

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:39.680
 They can be bought separately.

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:43.840
 They can be bought in a big old bundle and they are the perfect Christmas present for

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:49.060
 the fish listener in your life or maybe just a Christmas present to yourself.

00:00:49.060 --> 00:00:52.120
 Second up, well just a quick reminder about Club Fish.

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:58.000
 That is the secret members area of fish where you can get ad free episodes, you can get

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:03.400
 loads of bonus content such as compilations and quizzes and the mail bag.

00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:07.240
 You can join our discord, there's all sorts of stuff up there and the way you get to that

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:10.520
 is again to go to nosuchthingasafish.com.

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:17.200
 Finally, if you go to nosuchthingasafish.com/ukrain then you'll get to a very special thing.

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:22.200
 We have teamed up with some of our friends in Kyiv and they have made a quiz which is

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:24.920
 based on facts from nosuchthingasafish.

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:30.040
 It's on an app called The Game, it's a really cool app, it's like a quiz based on this kind

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:31.800
 of slavic style of quizzing.

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:35.560
 The questions are really really fun and that is completely free.

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:40.080
 All that we ask is that at the end of it you at least consider giving some money to U24

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:45.080
 which is the main place for charitable donations in support of Ukraine to help rebuild the

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:46.080
 country.

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:51.880
 Okay, well that's it, three different things, buy some merch, join clubfish, do the quiz

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:54.920
 and help Ukraine if you can if you have any spare money.

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:58.560
 And if you want to do none of those things then worry not because the podcast which will

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:05.040
 always be free is coming up right after I say those magic words on with the podcast.

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:26.480
 Hello and welcome to another episode of No Such Thing As A Fish, a weekly podcast coming

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:29.520
 to you from the QI offices in Covern Garden.

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:34.200
 My name is Dan Schreiber, I am sitting here with Andrew Hunter Murray, James Harkin and

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:38.440
 Anna Tyshinsky and once again we have gathered around the microphones with our four favorite

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:43.920
 facts from the last seven days and in a particular order, here we go.

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:46.920
 Starting with fact number one and that is my fact.

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:53.360
 My fact this week is that the 1986 ocean search to recover debris from the Challenger disaster

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:59.720
 also turned up 25 kilograms of cocaine, the value of which was enough to cover the $13

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:02.680
 million cost of the entire search operation.

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:04.880
 Wow, what a shame.

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:06.200
 It's which bit?

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:10.280
 Well no, the fact that they could have gotten that money and it would have paid for the

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:12.960
 whole thing but obviously you can't just go and sell your cocaine.

00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:13.960
 Which is weird isn't it?

00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:15.840
 You should be able to sell your cocaine.

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:19.600
 There should be like a government buyback program but for cocaine.

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:20.600
 Exactly.

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:21.600
 Because in the end they just burnt it right?

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:26.360
 So you could argue that this whole thing cost about $26 billion.

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:29.600
 So what this was is obviously the very tragic Challenger disaster.

00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:35.520
 NASA sent a spaceship up in space, 73 seconds into its launch it explodes.

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:37.600
 That was January 1986.

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:41.520
 They then start the rescue mission to try and salvage any of the bits of the ship that

00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:42.520
 they could find.

00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:47.200
 The bit where it exploded over was just over Florida so the ocean patch that it landed

00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:50.400
 in is a very garbage-y patched bit of ocean.

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:54.720
 So to find it was a very hard process because they were using sonar and when you use the

00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:59.120
 sonar you're picking up on everything literally from garbage all the way through to shipwrecks

00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:00.120
 and so on.

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:04.920
 So along the way they found the things they trawled up included marine batteries, trash

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:09.160
 cans, paint cans, there was half a torpedo, a refrigerator.

00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:11.120
 It was like everything but the kitchen sink wasn't it?

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:15.120
 Well it was literally not because they found a kitchen sink as well.

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:18.640
 Is this just a clever way of getting someone to clear up the oceans without telling them

00:04:18.640 --> 00:04:19.640
 they're clearing out the oceans?

00:04:19.640 --> 00:04:23.840
 Like when you kind of put a pee on a bit of - how do you trick children to eat healthy

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:24.840
 food?

00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:25.840
 You know you put a pee on a bit of chocolate or something.

00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:26.840
 Yeah.

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:27.840
 You put a pee on a bit of chocolate.

00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:28.840
 That's it.

00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:38.320
 They did find a lot of cocaine in that area not just the Challenger search rescue mission.

00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:43.680
 They found five identical duffel bags all of which had cocaine in over about a six-month

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:44.680
 period.

00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:45.680
 Identical duffel bags?

00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:46.680
 Yeah.

00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:50.120
 So the NASA people they found the fifth one but there had been four previous duffel bags

00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:53.520
 all full of cocaine that had been found in the area.

00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:56.600
 It's quite a good way to hide cocaine I think in a duffel bag because I don't think people

00:04:56.600 --> 00:04:57.600
 look in a duffel bag.

00:04:57.600 --> 00:04:58.600
 Do you think?

00:04:58.600 --> 00:05:02.440
 I've never said duffel bag that's many times in a short space of time but I think of duffel

00:05:02.440 --> 00:05:06.320
 bags as being something quite innocuous, something quite as you take to school, you have a duffel

00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:07.320
 bag.

00:05:07.320 --> 00:05:11.640
 Yeah but I think if you watch like certainly British gangster movies like the Guy Ritchie

00:05:11.640 --> 00:05:14.080
 kind of movies you can imagine them opening up a duffel bag.

00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:15.280
 It's always in a duffel bag.

00:05:15.280 --> 00:05:17.720
 I feel like that's your classic cocaine character.

00:05:17.720 --> 00:05:18.720
 What's a duffel?

00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:19.720
 What is duffel?

00:05:19.720 --> 00:05:20.720
 Duffel is a town in Belgium.

00:05:20.720 --> 00:05:21.720
 Is it?

00:05:21.720 --> 00:05:22.720
 Yeah, yeah.

00:05:22.720 --> 00:05:23.720
 I think it's a shoulder bag.

00:05:23.720 --> 00:05:24.720
 Yeah.

00:05:24.720 --> 00:05:25.720
 Oh a shoulder bag.

00:05:25.720 --> 00:05:26.720
 I associate it with crime.

00:05:26.720 --> 00:05:27.720
 Definitely.

00:05:27.720 --> 00:05:29.720
 What are you thinking of?

00:05:29.720 --> 00:05:32.280
 I think of duffel as a light blue cloth.

00:05:32.280 --> 00:05:34.040
 Yeah, that's what I'm thinking as well.

00:05:34.040 --> 00:05:35.040
 Oh okay, okay.

00:05:35.040 --> 00:05:36.040
 Right.

00:05:36.040 --> 00:05:37.040
 Well, yeah.

00:05:37.040 --> 00:05:41.440
 But also I would argue that duffel bag doesn't get an exemption from when you walk in to

00:05:41.440 --> 00:05:44.800
 say a building and they have security checks not to be opened.

00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:46.240
 They normally wave you through.

00:05:46.240 --> 00:05:49.160
 Excuse me sir, is that a duffel bag?

00:05:49.160 --> 00:05:53.400
 But from the Belgian town, yeah, come on through, yeah that's fine.

00:05:53.400 --> 00:05:58.920
 These five identical duffel bags full of cocaine, four of them, they managed to get the cocaine

00:05:58.920 --> 00:06:01.360
 and they managed to destroy it.

00:06:01.360 --> 00:06:04.960
 Can you guess what happened to the fifth amount of cocaine?

00:06:04.960 --> 00:06:08.600
 So there's another duffel bag full of cocaine which they never destroyed.

00:06:08.600 --> 00:06:09.600
 Went into a museum?

00:06:09.600 --> 00:06:12.760
 The cocaine museum, yeah.

00:06:12.760 --> 00:06:15.640
 Very good glass cases on those exhibits.

00:06:15.640 --> 00:06:16.640
 The audio guide.

00:06:16.640 --> 00:06:17.720
 Yes you're going through the cocaine museum now.

00:06:17.720 --> 00:06:23.000
 Yes, if you look on your left hand side this is a really good exhibit.

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:28.680
 It went missing, it was put into a sixth duffel bag and smuggled out that way.

00:06:28.680 --> 00:06:34.320
 No it was found by a party boat just off the coast of Florida and they found this massive

00:06:34.320 --> 00:06:38.920
 bag of cocaine and thought they're not going to believe us if we take this back so they

00:06:38.920 --> 00:06:46.920
 emptied all of the cocaine back into the sea and they took it off, 25 kilos as a party.

00:06:46.920 --> 00:06:49.920
 And what happened to the duffel bags, do we know?

00:06:49.920 --> 00:06:53.280
 Well I don't know.

00:06:53.280 --> 00:06:55.480
 Often what would happen is they would sell them on, wouldn't they?

00:06:55.480 --> 00:07:00.120
 The police or the Coast Guard would, if they find stuff and it's not illegal, they have

00:07:00.120 --> 00:07:05.160
 like auctions and stuff so there might have been, if you'd have seen a lot of four identical

00:07:05.160 --> 00:07:06.160
 duffel bags.

00:07:06.160 --> 00:07:10.160
 Do you think, and if you got your head right in one and really sniffed away at the lining,

00:07:10.160 --> 00:07:11.840
 you could definitely get a hit I'd imagine.

00:07:11.840 --> 00:07:12.840
 Definitely.

00:07:12.840 --> 00:07:13.840
 Do you think?

00:07:13.840 --> 00:07:15.100
 It's not up, isn't it cocaine?

00:07:15.100 --> 00:07:16.720
 I'm not an expert on drugs.

00:07:16.720 --> 00:07:18.960
 I don't think you put it in the bag loose.

00:07:18.960 --> 00:07:19.960
 No, that's fair.

00:07:19.960 --> 00:07:20.960
 That is fair.

00:07:20.960 --> 00:07:27.640
 Can I just quickly ask about the duffel bags, do we know if it was part of a shipwrecked

00:07:27.640 --> 00:07:28.640
 or what?

00:07:28.640 --> 00:07:32.320
 We don't know where they came from these duffel bags, presumably some kind of nefarious

00:07:32.320 --> 00:07:33.320
 activity.

00:07:33.320 --> 00:07:34.320
 Yeah.

00:07:34.320 --> 00:07:36.760
 But we're not, no they were, that's kind of the mystery is where they came from.

00:07:36.760 --> 00:07:37.760
 Right.

00:07:37.760 --> 00:07:38.760
 What a great ad for duffel bags though.

00:07:38.760 --> 00:07:39.760
 They're so resilient.

00:07:39.760 --> 00:07:40.760
 It's podcast.

00:07:40.760 --> 00:07:41.760
 Yeah, it is.

00:07:41.760 --> 00:07:43.320
 I think you can just find them floating in the ocean.

00:07:43.320 --> 00:07:45.680
 They might have survived the plane crash or a sunken ship.

00:07:45.680 --> 00:07:49.240
 Well, we don't know what kind of state the cocaine was in, it might have been unsnortable.

00:07:49.240 --> 00:07:50.320
 It could have been drenched.

00:07:50.320 --> 00:07:53.960
 You know when you eat some crab meat sometimes and there's a tiny little bit of crab shell

00:07:53.960 --> 00:07:55.960
 in, do you reckon it's the same with snorting cocaine?

00:07:55.960 --> 00:07:57.680
 You're like, oh, there's a bit of shell in this.

00:07:57.680 --> 00:07:58.680
 Yeah, yeah.

00:07:58.680 --> 00:07:59.680
 I think it is, yeah.

00:07:59.680 --> 00:08:00.680
 Duffel bags.

00:08:00.680 --> 00:08:05.920
 I was looking up pharmaceutical things found on shipwrecks and I think I found maybe the

00:08:05.920 --> 00:08:10.880
 oldest example of this being found, so this was discovered in 1990, not from 1990.

00:08:10.880 --> 00:08:17.200
 These archaeologists found an ancient Greek shipwreck and there were pills on board that

00:08:17.200 --> 00:08:18.360
 they were able to retrieve.

00:08:18.360 --> 00:08:19.520
 Can you imagine that?

00:08:19.520 --> 00:08:20.520
 Wow.

00:08:20.520 --> 00:08:21.520
 I know.

00:08:21.520 --> 00:08:24.840
 They were in a duffel bag that had been, obviously they weren't.

00:08:24.840 --> 00:08:28.080
 But then the scientists were able to analyse them and we know what people were taking as

00:08:28.080 --> 00:08:31.000
 medicine because we literally have surviving medicine from ancient Greece.

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:32.000
 So you have what they are?

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:33.000
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:37.320
 Lots of different ingredients which were all sort of faintly vegetable or herbal.

00:08:37.320 --> 00:08:42.160
 So celery, carrot, radish, wild onion, oak, cabbage and a few other things.

00:08:42.160 --> 00:08:47.200
 And they were kind of, I think we've been able to tie them to recipes or medical manuals

00:08:47.200 --> 00:08:49.440
 from the time that said, oh, this is good for lots of things.

00:08:49.440 --> 00:08:51.680
 And these are kind of cure-all pills, basically.

00:08:51.680 --> 00:08:52.680
 Lots of different ailments.

00:08:52.680 --> 00:08:53.680
 That's incredible.

00:08:53.680 --> 00:08:54.680
 How's that?

00:08:54.680 --> 00:08:55.680
 Wow.

00:08:55.680 --> 00:08:56.680
 It's basically a vitamin pill, right?

00:08:56.680 --> 00:08:57.680
 Pretty much.

00:08:57.680 --> 00:09:00.320
 You should have given them to Crabtree and Evelyn.

00:09:00.320 --> 00:09:01.320
 Crabtree and Evelyn.

00:09:01.320 --> 00:09:07.280
 Crabtree and Evelyn is that shop that sells, it's quite expensive.

00:09:07.280 --> 00:09:11.820
 It's expensive, herbal stuff, which I'm sure is very useful for a lot of people.

00:09:11.820 --> 00:09:12.820
 Sure.

00:09:12.820 --> 00:09:14.800
 Do you guys don't know Crabtree and Evelyn?

00:09:14.800 --> 00:09:16.680
 I'm afraid it hasn't hit Bolton, I don't think.

00:09:16.680 --> 00:09:17.680
 I mean, there are just shops.

00:09:17.680 --> 00:09:19.640
 There's one bit, about 10 yards from our office.

00:09:19.640 --> 00:09:20.640
 Is there?

00:09:20.640 --> 00:09:21.640
 Yeah, literally 10 yards from the office.

00:09:21.640 --> 00:09:22.640
 Oh, is that not Holland and Barrett?

00:09:22.640 --> 00:09:23.640
 Holland and Barrett.

00:09:23.640 --> 00:09:24.640
 That's what I'm thinking of.

00:09:24.640 --> 00:09:25.640
 Holland and Barrett.

00:09:25.640 --> 00:09:26.640
 Crabtree and Evelyn.

00:09:26.640 --> 00:09:27.640
 Crabtree and Evelyn.

00:09:27.640 --> 00:09:31.720
 If you know who Crabtree and Evelyn are, then please write it.

00:09:31.720 --> 00:09:36.080
 I think maybe Crabtree and Evelyn is another version of Holland and Barrett.

00:09:36.080 --> 00:09:37.080
 I don't know.

00:09:37.080 --> 00:09:44.560
 I feel like it sounds like two elderly detectives from a Richard Osmond novel, doesn't it?

00:09:44.560 --> 00:09:48.600
 I really thought you guys looked like the idiots in that.

00:09:48.600 --> 00:09:49.600
 Wow.

00:09:49.600 --> 00:09:52.600
 Yeah, we weak herbal cures.

00:09:52.600 --> 00:09:58.440
 So lots of shipwrecks that exist at the moment are being stolen.

00:09:58.440 --> 00:10:02.680
 There's a thriving market in shipwreck theft, which I had never heard of before reading

00:10:02.680 --> 00:10:03.680
 about this.

00:10:03.680 --> 00:10:08.800
 So it's Matt, 40 second world warships that were sunk have already been partly or totally

00:10:08.800 --> 00:10:12.440
 just removed from the ocean, and it's because they're incredibly valuable.

00:10:12.440 --> 00:10:13.680
 Can you guess why?

00:10:13.680 --> 00:10:14.680
 Yes.

00:10:14.680 --> 00:10:15.680
 Okay, great.

00:10:15.680 --> 00:10:16.680
 Let me tell you why.

00:10:16.680 --> 00:10:17.680
 I read the article.

00:10:17.680 --> 00:10:23.160
 So they contain something which we need today, like Euclia stuff, like uranium.

00:10:23.160 --> 00:10:24.160
 Oh, you're so close.

00:10:24.160 --> 00:10:26.760
 It's they're made of something that we need today.

00:10:26.760 --> 00:10:31.480
 So they're made of iPhones, very forward thinking.

00:10:31.480 --> 00:10:36.320
 No, they're made of steel, lots of them, but they're made of steel that was cast before

00:10:36.320 --> 00:10:37.320
 the year 1945.

00:10:37.320 --> 00:10:42.720
 When nuclear testing started, they're made of something called low background steel.

00:10:42.720 --> 00:10:45.040
 And that's incredibly valuable.

00:10:45.040 --> 00:10:46.240
 Scientists use it, don't they?

00:10:46.240 --> 00:10:50.480
 Scientists need loads of it for medical equipment, Geiger counters, space sensors, and all steel

00:10:50.480 --> 00:10:53.840
 that you make these days because it uses atmospheric air in the production is slightly

00:10:53.840 --> 00:10:55.280
 radioactive.

00:10:55.280 --> 00:11:00.600
 So this stuff is really valuable and also low radiation lead is used.

00:11:00.600 --> 00:11:04.440
 And a few years ago, they used a 2000 year old shipwreck.

00:11:04.440 --> 00:11:07.200
 The Italian Institute of Nuclear Physics used it.

00:11:07.200 --> 00:11:09.880
 They cut it up to make a neutrino detector.

00:11:09.880 --> 00:11:13.040
 And there's a bit of a hoohar about it at the time because, you know, it's sort of controversial

00:11:13.040 --> 00:11:17.160
 and yeah, but it's worth 20 times as much as normal lead, low background lead.

00:11:17.160 --> 00:11:21.280
 It's really and but there is one bit of good news, which is that this, you know, the steel

00:11:21.280 --> 00:11:23.760
 is all steel today is radioactive.

00:11:23.760 --> 00:11:27.960
 It's getting less radioactive because we're not doing as many nuclear tests anymore.

00:11:27.960 --> 00:11:32.400
 Well, at least there's no danger of nuclear war in the next year or so.

00:11:32.400 --> 00:11:36.640
 At the moment, at the time of recording, background radiation is decreasing.

00:11:36.640 --> 00:11:42.000
 No, I've just thought, if you are a supervillain who just got a load of this iron, it's in

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:45.960
 your best interest to kind of start another nuclear war, isn't it?

00:11:45.960 --> 00:11:48.320
 Because you want the value to increase.

00:11:48.320 --> 00:11:49.320
 Yeah.

00:11:49.320 --> 00:11:50.320
 That's terrible.

00:11:50.320 --> 00:11:51.320
 That's a James Bond plot.

00:11:51.320 --> 00:11:55.480
 It's a classic James Bond very convoluted way of making money as opposed to trading.

00:11:55.480 --> 00:11:56.480
 I love it.

00:11:56.480 --> 00:11:58.960
 But it is, I mean, it's hard getting stuff off ships.

00:11:58.960 --> 00:12:03.640
 It's hard getting ships up like the salvage, the technology of salvage is so cool.

00:12:03.640 --> 00:12:04.640
 They do.

00:12:04.640 --> 00:12:07.640
 I was reading about when they salvaged the Costa Concordia member that sunk in the med

00:12:07.640 --> 00:12:14.040
 in 2012 and they have armbands basically to get them back up to the surface.

00:12:14.040 --> 00:12:17.040
 It's too late for armbands.

00:12:17.040 --> 00:12:22.720
 It's kind of made of steel, probably stolen from some other sunk in ship.

00:12:22.720 --> 00:12:27.800
 They're called Sponsons and they are these projections that they attach to the side of

00:12:27.800 --> 00:12:28.800
 the ship.

00:12:28.800 --> 00:12:30.240
 So you've got a ship on the floor of the ocean.

00:12:30.240 --> 00:12:31.240
 It's on its side.

00:12:31.240 --> 00:12:36.320
 First of all, you'll fill one Sponson with water and the other with air and so that will

00:12:36.320 --> 00:12:40.200
 tip the ship upright as the air one lifts in the water.

00:12:40.200 --> 00:12:44.840
 But the water one is weighed down and then you'll get rid of the water that's in the

00:12:44.840 --> 00:12:45.840
 heavier one.

00:12:45.840 --> 00:12:49.840
 So they've both got air in them and then that just floats it up to the surface like

00:12:49.840 --> 00:12:50.840
 a pair of armbands.

00:12:50.840 --> 00:12:51.840
 Pretty cool.

00:12:51.840 --> 00:12:58.240
 It is quite cool and I think they did that to Costa Concordia I think and like USSR.

00:12:58.240 --> 00:13:01.120
 Why did they do it to Costa, why didn't they just leave it?

00:13:01.120 --> 00:13:02.120
 Yeah, good question.

00:13:02.120 --> 00:13:05.800
 Like these things with the really expensive iron, I see why you would do that or if you

00:13:05.800 --> 00:13:07.520
 had a galley with loads of gold coins.

00:13:07.520 --> 00:13:08.520
 Yeah.

00:13:08.520 --> 00:13:11.400
 It feels like Costa Concordia would just have, you know, like a pool table.

00:13:11.400 --> 00:13:15.760
 I think it was on its, wasn't it poking out of the water?

00:13:15.760 --> 00:13:16.760
 Yeah.

00:13:16.760 --> 00:13:17.760
 It wasn't quite fully in.

00:13:17.760 --> 00:13:18.760
 I think it wasn't fully submerged.

00:13:18.760 --> 00:13:24.160
 I think it probably blocking other traffic and also useful for scrapers, I guess.

00:13:24.160 --> 00:13:29.660
 But I think in those cases where you had court cases and so on, I think it's part of the

00:13:29.660 --> 00:13:33.120
 working out the insurance and all that sort of stuff, isn't it?

00:13:33.120 --> 00:13:34.640
 Did it definitely hit in the way it did?

00:13:34.640 --> 00:13:37.360
 Let's look and see whether you have to look into that kind of stuff.

00:13:37.360 --> 00:13:39.680
 I suppose that's what they were doing with Challenger, wasn't it?

00:13:39.680 --> 00:13:40.680
 A lot of it.

00:13:40.680 --> 00:13:41.680
 Yeah.

00:13:41.680 --> 00:13:44.160
 It was like an investigation as much as trying to salvage anything.

00:13:44.160 --> 00:13:45.160
 Yeah.

00:13:45.160 --> 00:13:46.160
 Mentioning Challenger again very quickly.

00:13:46.160 --> 00:13:47.160
 Big Bird was meant to be on Challenger.

00:13:47.160 --> 00:13:48.160
 Oh yeah.

00:13:48.160 --> 00:13:51.360
 The last minute thing that, well, it wasn't super last minute.

00:13:51.360 --> 00:13:52.360
 It was...

00:13:52.360 --> 00:13:53.360
 Quit still.

00:13:53.360 --> 00:13:54.360
 Pause.

00:13:54.360 --> 00:13:56.360
 Three, two, wait.

00:13:56.360 --> 00:13:57.360
 Yeah.

00:13:57.360 --> 00:14:03.360
 Three, ah, ah, ah, ah, two, ah, ah, ah, ah.

00:14:03.360 --> 00:14:08.720
 Yeah, the actor was asked to go in and be part of the mission.

00:14:08.720 --> 00:14:09.720
 Gosh.

00:14:09.720 --> 00:14:13.000
 I think his name was Carol Spinney and he, and it was all going to go ahead, but then

00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:16.720
 they realized that the Big Bird costume was way too big to get in there.

00:14:16.720 --> 00:14:20.200
 And there's a very sad account, actually, of them at Sesame Street watching the Challenger

00:14:20.200 --> 00:14:22.680
 go up and Carol Spinney going, "Oh, I was meant to be on that."

00:14:22.680 --> 00:14:24.960
 And then the explosion and the sort of the realization.

00:14:24.960 --> 00:14:25.960
 Wow.

00:14:25.960 --> 00:14:26.960
 Yeah.

00:14:26.960 --> 00:14:27.960
 Really, really horrible.

00:14:27.960 --> 00:14:28.960
 Yeah.

00:14:28.960 --> 00:14:33.000
 Something else that washes up that we've never mentioned on this show is feet.

00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:34.000
 Human feet.

00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:35.000
 And human feet.

00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:36.000
 Okay.

00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:38.240
 Yeah, I was just looking at weird stuff found in the ocean.

00:14:38.240 --> 00:14:39.240
 Oh yeah.

00:14:39.240 --> 00:14:40.760
 And I found out why.

00:14:40.760 --> 00:14:42.840
 So do you remember this mystery it started about?

00:14:42.840 --> 00:14:45.480
 Do we know why?

00:14:45.480 --> 00:14:46.880
 We can speculate reliably.

00:14:46.880 --> 00:14:50.640
 So they kept finding like, was it like just left feet or something?

00:14:50.640 --> 00:14:51.640
 No, it wasn't.

00:14:51.640 --> 00:14:53.720
 I think it was, it was basically feet overall.

00:14:53.720 --> 00:14:54.720
 Okay.

00:14:54.720 --> 00:14:55.720
 There was a while when a few left ones I found.

00:14:55.720 --> 00:14:56.720
 There was shod feet, weren't they?

00:14:56.720 --> 00:14:57.720
 Yeah.

00:14:57.720 --> 00:14:58.720
 There was shod feet.

00:14:58.720 --> 00:14:59.720
 Yes.

00:14:59.720 --> 00:15:00.720
 Wearing a shoe.

00:15:00.720 --> 00:15:06.020
 Usually used to refer to horses, but in Andy's case, apparently, to refer to the people.

00:15:06.020 --> 00:15:07.020
 Where was this?

00:15:07.020 --> 00:15:08.020
 Was this globally?

00:15:08.020 --> 00:15:09.020
 They were rocking up on shorelines?

00:15:09.020 --> 00:15:10.020
 No.

00:15:10.020 --> 00:15:11.020
 This was the old thing.

00:15:11.020 --> 00:15:14.560
 It was specifically in Canada, or Vancouver Island, in a place called the Salish Sea.

00:15:14.560 --> 00:15:19.920
 So it's just like near the border with the U.S. And from 2007, over the course of 12

00:15:19.920 --> 00:15:24.800
 years, 15 different feet within shoes washed up.

00:15:24.800 --> 00:15:28.520
 And the shoes were all sneakers, except one shoe, which was a walking boot.

00:15:28.520 --> 00:15:31.520
 That sounds irrelevant, but it's not.

00:15:31.520 --> 00:15:32.520
 Oh.

00:15:32.520 --> 00:15:35.640
 And everyone was, there were lots of theories, obviously, about who had been assassinated

00:15:35.640 --> 00:15:37.280
 and had their feet chopped off.

00:15:37.280 --> 00:15:43.400
 So this woman, Gail Anderson, who studies things like this, how things decompose, sank

00:15:43.400 --> 00:15:48.240
 a bunch of dead pigs into the Salish Sea to see how they decompose.

00:15:48.240 --> 00:15:49.240
 Were they shod?

00:15:49.240 --> 00:15:50.240
 Yeah.

00:15:50.240 --> 00:15:54.320
 They actually were not shod because that was something, because you can't fit a sneaker

00:15:54.320 --> 00:16:00.700
 on a pig, I think, as the old saying goes.

00:16:00.700 --> 00:16:04.440
 They've got trotters, though, which have a different, I imagine, float profile.

00:16:04.440 --> 00:16:05.440
 Yeah.

00:16:05.440 --> 00:16:06.440
 I think they do.

00:16:06.440 --> 00:16:10.520
 So in an ideal world, she would have sunk a human body, but there are issues around

00:16:10.520 --> 00:16:11.520
 that.

00:16:11.520 --> 00:16:14.480
 So I would definitely give my consent for a weird experiment like that.

00:16:14.480 --> 00:16:15.480
 I know me, too.

00:16:15.480 --> 00:16:16.480
 If there was a use for an...

00:16:16.480 --> 00:16:17.480
 I would say, orally, you just have.

00:16:17.480 --> 00:16:18.480
 Oh, yeah.

00:16:18.480 --> 00:16:19.480
 Yeah.

00:16:19.480 --> 00:16:21.400
 If there's any mad scientist listening.

00:16:21.400 --> 00:16:23.640
 Whoever gets me first gets me for...

00:16:23.640 --> 00:16:25.440
 Is that legally possible?

00:16:25.440 --> 00:16:26.440
 I'm sure.

00:16:26.440 --> 00:16:27.440
 Wow.

00:16:27.440 --> 00:16:28.440
 Okay.

00:16:28.440 --> 00:16:29.440
 Great.

00:16:29.440 --> 00:16:31.440
 There should definitely be a thing you can check, donate my body to weird science.

00:16:31.440 --> 00:16:34.200
 You can donate your body to science, but I need it to be...

00:16:34.200 --> 00:16:35.200
 Specifically, yeah.

00:16:35.200 --> 00:16:36.200
 Something.

00:16:36.200 --> 00:16:37.200
 Yeah.

00:16:37.200 --> 00:16:39.200
 Specifically, no such thing as a fish-worthy science.

00:16:39.200 --> 00:16:40.200
 Anyway.

00:16:40.200 --> 00:16:41.200
 Oh, yeah, trotters.

00:16:41.200 --> 00:16:44.520
 Basically, the conclusion was that they get eaten by crustaceans pretty quickly, but

00:16:44.520 --> 00:16:49.200
 in your ankles, you've got basically soft tissue like tendons, joints, ligaments, stuff

00:16:49.200 --> 00:16:50.200
 like that.

00:16:50.200 --> 00:16:51.720
 So they can eat through all of that.

00:16:51.720 --> 00:16:56.560
 And because there's a trend in this area over the last 20 years for trainers, which have

00:16:56.560 --> 00:16:57.560
 air bubbles in them.

00:16:57.560 --> 00:16:58.760
 Like nike-airs and stuff.

00:16:58.760 --> 00:16:59.760
 Nike-airs.

00:16:59.760 --> 00:17:03.360
 They pop up to the surface and bob along to a beach.

00:17:03.360 --> 00:17:04.360
 But the feet are remaining.

00:17:04.360 --> 00:17:05.360
 The feet haven't been eaten.

00:17:05.360 --> 00:17:06.360
 No, because that's what...

00:17:06.360 --> 00:17:08.360
 I think they're probably skeleton feet inside the show at this point.

00:17:08.360 --> 00:17:09.360
 I suppose, yeah.

00:17:09.360 --> 00:17:13.400
 You kind of eat the ankle and then you kind of turn around to start eating the foot, but

00:17:13.400 --> 00:17:15.440
 it's already floating away kind of thing.

00:17:15.440 --> 00:17:19.720
 It's kind of amazing that crabs and lobsters also find it hard to get to the difficult

00:17:19.720 --> 00:17:20.720
 bits of humans.

00:17:20.720 --> 00:17:21.720
 Yeah.

00:17:21.720 --> 00:17:24.720
 They should have a special human fork.

00:17:24.720 --> 00:17:25.720
 Yeah, exactly.

00:17:25.720 --> 00:17:26.720
 Wow.

00:17:26.720 --> 00:17:27.720
 It's really crazy.

00:17:27.720 --> 00:17:28.720
 Oh, I'm not ordering the human.

00:17:28.720 --> 00:17:29.720
 No.

00:17:29.720 --> 00:17:30.720
 I can't, no.

00:17:30.720 --> 00:17:31.720
 I've just got a new shirt.

00:17:31.720 --> 00:17:32.720
 Okay.

00:17:32.720 --> 00:17:41.120
 It is time for fact number two and that is Anna.

00:17:41.120 --> 00:17:45.680
 My fact this week is that chimps will help to break you out of prison, but only if they

00:17:45.680 --> 00:17:48.680
 like you.

00:17:48.680 --> 00:17:51.200
 So is it a good idea to befriend some chimps?

00:17:51.200 --> 00:17:52.200
 Before the bank job.

00:17:52.200 --> 00:17:53.200
 Before the bank job.

00:17:53.200 --> 00:17:54.760
 Go straight from the sanctuary to...

00:17:54.760 --> 00:17:55.760
 Yeah.

00:17:55.760 --> 00:18:00.840
 I would say it depends if the prison you're aimed for is staffed by chimps, which very

00:18:00.840 --> 00:18:01.840
 few are.

00:18:01.840 --> 00:18:02.840
 Yeah.

00:18:02.840 --> 00:18:03.840
 Yeah.

00:18:03.840 --> 00:18:06.480
 So I don't know how many practical benefits this is going to have for you, but this...

00:18:06.480 --> 00:18:11.380
 I think I originally read this a while ago in a book called Mental Leaps by Keith Holyoke,

00:18:11.380 --> 00:18:14.960
 which is really good, but it's about this specific chimp called Sarah on whom lots of

00:18:14.960 --> 00:18:17.120
 experiments were done in the 80s.

00:18:17.120 --> 00:18:22.160
 We might have mentioned her before and they were done by David and Anna Premack and they

00:18:22.160 --> 00:18:26.880
 were trying to suss out basically the extent to which chimps have empathy and a theory

00:18:26.880 --> 00:18:31.480
 of mind so they can understand that other beings are conscious beings just like them.

00:18:31.480 --> 00:18:37.120
 And so they did this amazing experiment where they showed her videos of actors trapped in

00:18:37.120 --> 00:18:42.480
 a cage and then they showed her pictures, like various grainy black and white pictures

00:18:42.480 --> 00:18:43.480
 of various objects.

00:18:43.480 --> 00:18:47.960
 So it would be like a key that could let her out of the cage, let the actor out of the

00:18:47.960 --> 00:18:52.400
 cage and then a book and then a crowbar and then a poo or whatever.

00:18:52.400 --> 00:18:56.240
 And I think you've made a mistake in describing this that you've included crowbar, which also

00:18:56.240 --> 00:18:57.880
 can be used to get you out of prison.

00:18:57.880 --> 00:19:00.720
 It should have been the key and then a lot of things that you can't use.

00:19:00.720 --> 00:19:05.920
 And in fact, a book can help you on your journey out of prison through education.

00:19:05.920 --> 00:19:06.920
 Yeah.

00:19:06.920 --> 00:19:07.920
 Right.

00:19:07.920 --> 00:19:08.920
 That is a more long form, isn't it?

00:19:08.920 --> 00:19:09.920
 You're absolutely right.

00:19:09.920 --> 00:19:13.480
 I've picked the one other object that would have confused the hell out of poor Sarah and

00:19:13.480 --> 00:19:14.480
 Chimp.

00:19:14.480 --> 00:19:15.480
 I got confused though.

00:19:15.480 --> 00:19:16.480
 Yeah, yeah.

00:19:16.480 --> 00:19:17.480
 I'm so sorry.

00:19:17.480 --> 00:19:18.480
 Flingy poo at the guard.

00:19:18.480 --> 00:19:19.480
 He's distracted.

00:19:19.480 --> 00:19:20.480
 You're over the wall.

00:19:20.480 --> 00:19:21.480
 Hey, you should be reading your book.

00:19:21.480 --> 00:19:22.480
 Right.

00:19:22.480 --> 00:19:25.360
 I'm just going to say they gave her a key.

00:19:25.360 --> 00:19:28.320
 They showed her a picture of a key and then brought three other things that can't get

00:19:28.320 --> 00:19:29.320
 you out of prison.

00:19:29.320 --> 00:19:30.320
 Yeah.

00:19:30.320 --> 00:19:32.360
 They showed her how to pick the picture of the key.

00:19:32.360 --> 00:19:36.320
 So that was like, she knows that this actor wants to get out of prison and she's managed

00:19:36.320 --> 00:19:40.600
 to match up this image, grainy image, and figure out that that's what the actor would

00:19:40.600 --> 00:19:41.600
 want.

00:19:41.600 --> 00:19:42.600
 Right.

00:19:42.600 --> 00:19:43.600
 And then there were lots of other stuff as well.

00:19:43.600 --> 00:19:45.960
 So they'd show actors trying to reach a banana that's just out of reach beyond the

00:19:45.960 --> 00:19:50.640
 cage or trying to reach up to a banana that was on the ceiling and couldn't get to it.

00:19:50.640 --> 00:19:58.960
 And they'd show her pictures of a ladder, a box, a jet pack, not a ladder, not a ladder.

00:19:58.960 --> 00:20:01.960
 And then three other things that you can't do.

00:20:01.960 --> 00:20:02.960
 Exactly.

00:20:02.960 --> 00:20:04.600
 A ladder and then a pole to get a banana.

00:20:04.600 --> 00:20:07.280
 Do they then give her the choice to help people?

00:20:07.280 --> 00:20:08.280
 Yes.

00:20:08.280 --> 00:20:09.280
 Okay.

00:20:09.280 --> 00:20:13.240
 So, well, then they did the experiment with two different people, Keith, her favorite

00:20:13.240 --> 00:20:14.240
 trainer.

00:20:14.240 --> 00:20:18.560
 And in the study, it says, Bill, Brackett's fictitious name because I guess didn't want

00:20:18.560 --> 00:20:19.560
 to be identified.

00:20:19.560 --> 00:20:20.560
 Oh.

00:20:20.560 --> 00:20:22.560
 Someone who she didn't like.

00:20:22.560 --> 00:20:26.800
 And she would choose the good versions for Keith so she'd get him the banana by giving

00:20:26.800 --> 00:20:32.440
 him the pole or let him out of prison, but for Bill, she chose bad outcomes for him.

00:20:32.440 --> 00:20:36.480
 So there'd be pictures of, for instance, Bill, like, sprawled out, having tripped over

00:20:36.480 --> 00:20:38.040
 the box isn't on the floor.

00:20:38.040 --> 00:20:40.740
 And she'd pick that one for him because he wasn't a fan.

00:20:40.740 --> 00:20:41.740
 What's Bill worried about?

00:20:41.740 --> 00:20:42.740
 How interesting.

00:20:42.740 --> 00:20:43.740
 What does he want?

00:20:43.740 --> 00:20:45.240
 No one to know his name?

00:20:45.240 --> 00:20:46.240
 I guess.

00:20:46.240 --> 00:20:47.240
 Because chimps don't like it.

00:20:47.240 --> 00:20:48.240
 It's embarrassing.

00:20:48.240 --> 00:20:49.240
 If a chimp doesn't like him, what's he done to the chimp?

00:20:49.240 --> 00:20:50.240
 Yeah.

00:20:50.240 --> 00:20:51.240
 Oh, I see.

00:20:51.240 --> 00:20:52.240
 Oh, there's an implication there.

00:20:52.240 --> 00:20:53.240
 Yeah.

00:20:53.240 --> 00:20:54.240
 I don't think we're...

00:20:54.240 --> 00:20:56.240
 I guess he just doesn't like, what, his music taste?

00:20:56.240 --> 00:20:59.280
 I think Bill's doing some dark stuff.

00:20:59.280 --> 00:21:00.280
 Okay.

00:21:00.280 --> 00:21:04.400
 There's no suggestion in the study that Bill did anything untoward.

00:21:04.400 --> 00:21:07.160
 We should actually, if you're going to say stuff like that, then we should change his

00:21:07.160 --> 00:21:09.360
 name again so that people don't know.

00:21:09.360 --> 00:21:10.360
 Oh, yeah.

00:21:10.360 --> 00:21:11.360
 Yeah, Mark.

00:21:11.360 --> 00:21:14.320
 And actually, I might change my name just so that they don't know it was me, so I'll

00:21:14.320 --> 00:21:15.320
 be Gary.

00:21:15.320 --> 00:21:16.320
 Wow.

00:21:16.320 --> 00:21:20.560
 Anyway, it's just so incredible the mental leaps that they can make, understanding.

00:21:20.560 --> 00:21:21.560
 This is a person.

00:21:21.560 --> 00:21:22.560
 It's a person I like.

00:21:22.560 --> 00:21:23.560
 I want to help them.

00:21:23.560 --> 00:21:24.560
 I don't want to say it.

00:21:24.560 --> 00:21:25.560
 I think they're smart.

00:21:25.560 --> 00:21:27.000
 I think chimpanzees are pretty clever.

00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:28.000
 Chimps.

00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:29.000
 Yeah.

00:21:29.000 --> 00:21:30.000
 It depends what you compare them to.

00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:31.000
 That's true.

00:21:31.000 --> 00:21:32.000
 Yeah.

00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:33.000
 If you compare them to Slavoj Zizek, they're not very smart.

00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:34.000
 But if you compare them to me...

00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:37.000
 If you compare them to Gary over here...

00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:43.880
 But the one thing they do is they will...

00:21:43.880 --> 00:21:46.800
 This is kind of, again, their friendship to enemy ratio.

00:21:46.800 --> 00:21:48.200
 They have enemy lists.

00:21:48.200 --> 00:21:49.200
 Do they?

00:21:49.200 --> 00:21:50.200
 Yeah.

00:21:50.200 --> 00:21:51.200
 Wow.

00:21:51.200 --> 00:21:52.200
 And the article I read said, "This is why chimpanzees are like Richard Nixon, which I think is

00:21:52.200 --> 00:21:53.200
 a bit unfair."

00:21:53.200 --> 00:21:57.480
 So this is a scientist from the Max Planck Institute.

00:21:57.480 --> 00:22:00.800
 They observed wild chimpanzees for thousands of hours in a row, right?

00:22:00.800 --> 00:22:01.800
 Yeah.

00:22:01.800 --> 00:22:03.920
 And what do chimpanzees spend lots of their time doing?

00:22:03.920 --> 00:22:04.920
 Grooming each other.

00:22:04.920 --> 00:22:05.920
 Grooming.

00:22:05.920 --> 00:22:06.920
 Yeah.

00:22:06.920 --> 00:22:07.920
 And it's a big thing.

00:22:07.920 --> 00:22:09.120
 And it's a huge part of their social life as well.

00:22:09.120 --> 00:22:14.240
 And basically, they have a very, very sophisticated mental map of who has groomed them recently,

00:22:14.240 --> 00:22:15.240
 who they've groomed.

00:22:15.240 --> 00:22:18.800
 And it's effectively who owes them a pint, you know, is that kind of social level.

00:22:18.800 --> 00:22:21.680
 So they will be able to return the favor for someone who's groomed them.

00:22:21.680 --> 00:22:25.780
 And they will freeze out other chimpanzees who haven't groomed them or who are selfish

00:22:25.780 --> 00:22:27.520
 and never groom anyone else.

00:22:27.520 --> 00:22:34.040
 And then do they break into their offices at the middle of the night and steal documents?

00:22:34.040 --> 00:22:41.000
 So for example, if Dan groomed James on Monday, then on Thursday, James might groom Dan back.

00:22:41.000 --> 00:22:42.680
 And the system works just fine.

00:22:42.680 --> 00:22:45.640
 As in, it doesn't need to be the same day for it to be, you know, that's for like...

00:22:45.640 --> 00:22:47.680
 I've slept three times, but I still remember it.

00:22:47.680 --> 00:22:48.680
 Exactly.

00:22:48.680 --> 00:22:53.240
 And like, Dan knows not to worry about it because he knows that you've got his back,

00:22:53.240 --> 00:22:54.240
 basically.

00:22:54.240 --> 00:22:58.240
 But, you know, if Dan grooms Anna on a Tuesday and there's nothing for the rest of the week

00:22:58.240 --> 00:23:02.240
 and the week after that, Dan will remember and is not to be trusted with this thing.

00:23:02.240 --> 00:23:03.240
 And, you know...

00:23:03.240 --> 00:23:04.240
 I just like...

00:23:04.240 --> 00:23:05.240
 He's a hairy man.

00:23:05.240 --> 00:23:06.240
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:23:06.240 --> 00:23:07.240
 It doesn't feel...

00:23:07.240 --> 00:23:08.240
 It's a normal work.

00:23:08.240 --> 00:23:09.240
 Yeah, yeah.

00:23:09.240 --> 00:23:10.240
 You're right.

00:23:10.240 --> 00:23:11.240
 We've got a lot on.

00:23:11.240 --> 00:23:17.520
 All gym research is so interesting and I was listening to actually show what the interview

00:23:17.520 --> 00:23:21.600
 Jane Goodall recently and it's so interesting listening to her, obviously it's maybe the

00:23:21.600 --> 00:23:27.960
 most famous chimp researcher ever, but when she started researching, she went to Tanzania,

00:23:27.960 --> 00:23:31.820
 she was the first person who saw chimps using tools, I think, using sticks to catch insects.

00:23:31.820 --> 00:23:37.760
 She got PhD at Cambridge based on that, but she got there and she was vilified and all

00:23:37.760 --> 00:23:40.800
 the other academics said, "You're doing this completely wrong," because she wanted to look

00:23:40.800 --> 00:23:45.160
 at chimp's personality and emotion and at the time, everyone else said, "That's really

00:23:45.160 --> 00:23:49.760
 unscientific, it doesn't make any sense, you're humanising these chimps, they're just animals."

00:23:49.760 --> 00:23:53.240
 Whereas she obviously was saying, "I've lived with these chimps, they're really similar

00:23:53.240 --> 00:23:58.320
 to us, the only way to understand them is by trying to look at them through these lenses."

00:23:58.320 --> 00:23:59.320
 Wow.

00:23:59.320 --> 00:24:00.320
 So, yeah, she was...

00:24:00.320 --> 00:24:01.320
 She was bitched about.

00:24:01.320 --> 00:24:04.440
 So, she would give them names and the scientists would like, "You can't give them names, that

00:24:04.440 --> 00:24:05.440
 is wild."

00:24:05.440 --> 00:24:11.080
 Well, she was part of a group of three women who were put together by Louis Leakey, who

00:24:11.080 --> 00:24:14.360
 was a paleoanthropologist and amazing character in this world.

00:24:14.360 --> 00:24:18.600
 And he was the one who thought that they needed studying at different closer contact and so

00:24:18.600 --> 00:24:24.080
 he wanted three women who he thought weren't necessarily even qualified for doing the job

00:24:24.080 --> 00:24:27.480
 and he wanted them to be single and he wanted to send them out there.

00:24:27.480 --> 00:24:32.040
 And so, he found Jane Goodall, he found Diane Fosse, and then there was a third one, unfortunately,

00:24:32.040 --> 00:24:35.600
 whose name I can't remember, and they were known as the Trimates or Leakey's Angels and

00:24:35.600 --> 00:24:36.600
 they would go out there.

00:24:36.600 --> 00:24:37.600
 Leakey's Angels?

00:24:37.600 --> 00:24:38.600
 Yeah.

00:24:38.600 --> 00:24:39.600
 Why did they have to be single?

00:24:39.600 --> 00:24:40.680
 Is that in case they fell in love with the chimps?

00:24:40.680 --> 00:24:43.400
 I think he was a bit of a eccentric character.

00:24:43.400 --> 00:24:47.600
 So, no, he was very much married, but he just had these eccentric ways.

00:24:47.600 --> 00:24:50.520
 He sent her a letter saying, "You've got to have your appendix taken out before you

00:24:50.520 --> 00:24:51.520
 go out there."

00:24:51.520 --> 00:24:54.840
 She did it and then he wrote back saying, "Oh, I was joking about that."

00:24:54.840 --> 00:24:58.080
 Oh, my God, that is a good prank.

00:24:58.080 --> 00:25:01.680
 He wanted to test who had the commitment to go out there was the joke of it and then

00:25:01.680 --> 00:25:03.000
 he said, "Oh, you actually did it?"

00:25:03.000 --> 00:25:04.200
 No, no, it was a joke.

00:25:04.200 --> 00:25:05.680
 He was just a jokey thing.

00:25:05.680 --> 00:25:09.120
 But if he was testing the commitment, it sounds like, you know, if he hadn't done it, he might

00:25:09.120 --> 00:25:10.560
 have been like, "You didn't pass the test."

00:25:10.560 --> 00:25:14.040
 My theory is he was back working on that to be like, "Oh, yeah, no, I was testing your

00:25:14.040 --> 00:25:15.040
 commitment."

00:25:15.040 --> 00:25:21.640
 Jane Goodall, by the way, I have a Barbie of Jane Goodall, which is like my equivalent

00:25:21.640 --> 00:25:23.800
 of Dan buying Ben Elton stuff.

00:25:23.800 --> 00:25:25.320
 What does it come with?

00:25:25.320 --> 00:25:29.860
 It comes with a little monkey, a little chimp, which is the David Greybeard chimp, which

00:25:29.860 --> 00:25:33.080
 is the one who she first saw using a stick as a tool.

00:25:33.080 --> 00:25:36.560
 You know, she properly believes a Bigfoot, like properly.

00:25:36.560 --> 00:25:37.560
 And I saw her recently.

00:25:37.560 --> 00:25:41.600
 Did you get this stuff out of these otherwise sane people?

00:25:41.600 --> 00:25:42.600
 It's bizarre.

00:25:42.600 --> 00:25:46.320
 There's this American program, which is called something like Bigfoot Uncovered or something.

00:25:46.320 --> 00:25:50.880
 It looks really kind of amateur, and yet Jane Goodall sat down for a major interview with

00:25:50.880 --> 00:25:56.040
 them and told all her anecdotal evidence that she believes that locals believe that it and

00:25:56.040 --> 00:25:57.040
 so on.

00:25:57.040 --> 00:26:02.680
 Did you not write a letter afterwards saying I was only joking about that, by the way?

00:26:02.680 --> 00:26:04.000
 I would just get a scar.

00:26:04.000 --> 00:26:07.080
 I would just get an appendectomy scar if someone asked me to do that.

00:26:07.080 --> 00:26:08.080
 Smart.

00:26:08.080 --> 00:26:11.920
 In most places where you're asked to have it removed, you probably do will have need

00:26:11.920 --> 00:26:12.920
 to have had it removed.

00:26:12.920 --> 00:26:16.160
 Yeah, most people aren't doing it for jokes, are they?

00:26:16.160 --> 00:26:17.160
 No.

00:26:17.160 --> 00:26:21.560
 How funny that little novelty scar is going to be when you're out in that isolated area.

00:26:21.560 --> 00:26:25.040
 No doctors are there.

00:26:25.040 --> 00:26:27.760
 Chimpanzees, they have their own theme tunes.

00:26:27.760 --> 00:26:29.360
 I really like this.

00:26:29.360 --> 00:26:30.360
 Really?

00:26:30.360 --> 00:26:31.360
 Yeah.

00:26:31.360 --> 00:26:32.360
 Just like Richard Nixon did.

00:26:32.360 --> 00:26:36.920
 They have, this is bizarre, they have these drum rhythms, male chimpanzees.

00:26:36.920 --> 00:26:40.800
 When they're traveling, they will bash really loudly.

00:26:40.800 --> 00:26:45.280
 They grab a big old tree root and they bash it against the surface of a tree and the specific

00:26:45.280 --> 00:26:50.760
 male chimpanzees have their own specific tunes or rhythms that they bash out and it's to

00:26:50.760 --> 00:26:54.600
 advertise their presence basically.

00:26:54.600 --> 00:26:59.400
 There's a primatologist called Catherine Hobaita who found this out and basically they can

00:26:59.400 --> 00:27:01.960
 decide whether they want to hang out with each other or not.

00:27:01.960 --> 00:27:03.560
 It's a bit social media-ish.

00:27:03.560 --> 00:27:04.560
 They're saying, I'm here.

00:27:04.560 --> 00:27:05.560
 I don't want to hang out.

00:27:05.560 --> 00:27:06.560
 I'm here.

00:27:06.560 --> 00:27:10.720
 Sounds more sophisticated than social media, to be honest.

00:27:10.720 --> 00:27:16.400
 But they also can be on incognito mode if they like and it's just not hitting the tree

00:27:16.400 --> 00:27:17.400
 with the thing.

00:27:17.400 --> 00:27:20.000
 Or you can steal someone's identity, couldn't you?

00:27:20.000 --> 00:27:25.680
 You know, get your own blue tick now by imitating their own blue stick.

00:27:25.680 --> 00:27:34.040
 Can I tell you guys about my favorite prison break of all time with the facts about breaking

00:27:34.040 --> 00:27:35.400
 human's out of prison?

00:27:35.400 --> 00:27:39.080
 This is a prisoner in South Korea who broke themselves out.

00:27:39.080 --> 00:27:42.720
 His name was Choi Gatbok and this was in 2012.

00:27:42.720 --> 00:27:48.480
 He was in jail for five days off the back of his arrest and he escaped by squeezing his

00:27:48.480 --> 00:27:51.480
 entire body through the food slot.

00:27:51.480 --> 00:27:55.600
 That is amazing.

00:27:55.600 --> 00:27:59.240
 So when you're in prison, you see this on prison dramas, right?

00:27:59.240 --> 00:28:03.840
 They come in with a tray with your food in, they open a little slot, they slide it under.

00:28:03.840 --> 00:28:06.280
 It's about the size of a letter box.

00:28:06.280 --> 00:28:07.780
 It's so tiny.

00:28:07.780 --> 00:28:15.320
 So the slot was 5.9 inches tall, 17.5 inches wide.

00:28:15.320 --> 00:28:16.320
 Come off it.

00:28:16.320 --> 00:28:18.640
 And Choi Gatbok got through it.

00:28:18.640 --> 00:28:19.640
 Is the story.

00:28:19.640 --> 00:28:20.640
 That's impossible.

00:28:20.640 --> 00:28:21.640
 It sounds impossible, right?

00:28:21.640 --> 00:28:22.880
 Is it a middle part of his name Gap?

00:28:22.880 --> 00:28:23.880
 It is.

00:28:23.880 --> 00:28:24.880
 Yeah.

00:28:24.880 --> 00:28:30.360
 He was known as the Korean Houdini and he's a yoga instructor.

00:28:30.360 --> 00:28:33.800
 And the borrower.

00:28:33.800 --> 00:28:35.300
 It seems too tiny, doesn't it?

00:28:35.300 --> 00:28:37.040
 That's 15 centimetres from the top.

00:28:37.040 --> 00:28:38.040
 That's nothing.

00:28:38.040 --> 00:28:39.760
 As long as you can get your head up, you've got to get your head up.

00:28:39.760 --> 00:28:43.520
 That's a lot more than five and a half inches what you just did there.

00:28:43.520 --> 00:28:48.760
 I'm always saying that.

00:28:48.760 --> 00:28:54.200
 But what are the bits, skull and hips, I guess, are the two challenge bits?

00:28:54.200 --> 00:28:55.200
 Shoulders are tough as well.

00:28:55.200 --> 00:28:56.200
 Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:28:56.200 --> 00:28:57.200
 What's your head through?

00:28:57.200 --> 00:28:59.000
 I think you might be okay.

00:28:59.000 --> 00:29:01.800
 As long as you can rotate your body in the right way.

00:29:01.800 --> 00:29:05.960
 Have you seen those guys in Covent Garden, just in that main square up there, who put

00:29:05.960 --> 00:29:08.640
 their entire body through a tennis racket pole?

00:29:08.640 --> 00:29:12.960
 Captain Frodo is a performer who I've seen do that on stage at a show called, I think

00:29:12.960 --> 00:29:13.960
 it's called Le Cleak.

00:29:13.960 --> 00:29:14.960
 Okay.

00:29:14.960 --> 00:29:17.720
 And he does a 12-inch tennis racket, I think I've mentioned it before, and then a 10-inch

00:29:17.720 --> 00:29:18.720
 racket.

00:29:18.720 --> 00:29:22.400
 And also, you can move a tennis racket around, whereas a food slot in a prison in a cell wall

00:29:22.400 --> 00:29:23.400
 stays in place.

00:29:23.400 --> 00:29:24.400
 Exactly.

00:29:24.400 --> 00:29:25.400
 It's incredible.

00:29:25.400 --> 00:29:27.280
 Does he remove the strings?

00:29:27.280 --> 00:29:28.280
 He does.

00:29:28.280 --> 00:29:29.280
 He does.

00:29:29.280 --> 00:29:30.280
 He does.

00:29:30.280 --> 00:29:34.800
 There's a guy called Henry Box Brown.

00:29:34.800 --> 00:29:41.720
 This was an enslaved American who got himself out of his slavery by asking someone to construct

00:29:41.720 --> 00:29:45.640
 a wooden box and posting himself from Virginia to Pennsylvania.

00:29:45.640 --> 00:29:46.640
 Amazing.

00:29:46.640 --> 00:29:47.640
 Posting.

00:29:47.640 --> 00:29:50.960
 Again, so he's one of those middle names where that's been added afterwards, right?

00:29:50.960 --> 00:29:51.960
 It has, yeah.

00:29:51.960 --> 00:29:53.560
 He was just called Henry Brown.

00:29:53.560 --> 00:29:54.560
 Got it.

00:29:54.560 --> 00:29:55.560
 And after he did the box.

00:29:55.560 --> 00:29:57.840
 Actually, it was a bit later.

00:29:57.840 --> 00:30:01.780
 On the box, it said, "Handle with care this side up."

00:30:01.780 --> 00:30:06.120
 And the article I read about it said, "Several times the box was placed upside down and handled

00:30:06.120 --> 00:30:07.120
 without care."

00:30:07.120 --> 00:30:08.120
 Oh, no.

00:30:08.120 --> 00:30:13.200
 It took him 27 hours, and he got to Philadelphia, and he posts himself to the Anti-Slavery Society

00:30:13.200 --> 00:30:14.200
 in Philadelphia.

00:30:14.200 --> 00:30:15.200
 Oh, my God.

00:30:15.200 --> 00:30:16.200
 So he's free when he arrived.

00:30:16.200 --> 00:30:17.200
 Awesome.

00:30:17.200 --> 00:30:21.760
 And he then moved to Britain, and he had another career, which is related to this.

00:30:21.760 --> 00:30:23.000
 Can you guess what it was?

00:30:23.000 --> 00:30:24.000
 Postman.

00:30:24.000 --> 00:30:25.000
 No.

00:30:25.000 --> 00:30:26.000
 Postman.

00:30:26.000 --> 00:30:27.000
 Um, removals.

00:30:27.000 --> 00:30:30.760
 Uh, he made labels which said this way up, and he embossed them rigorously.

00:30:30.760 --> 00:30:32.440
 Did he go on Telly?

00:30:32.440 --> 00:30:33.440
 He didn't go on Telly.

00:30:33.440 --> 00:30:34.440
 It was a bit before that.

00:30:34.440 --> 00:30:35.440
 It was the 1860s.

00:30:35.440 --> 00:30:36.440
 Um, oh, the 1860s.

00:30:36.440 --> 00:30:37.440
 Yeah.

00:30:37.440 --> 00:30:38.440
 Um.

00:30:38.440 --> 00:30:39.440
 But you're close.

00:30:39.440 --> 00:30:40.440
 There's a lot to do with packaging.

00:30:40.440 --> 00:30:41.440
 Showbiz.

00:30:41.440 --> 00:30:42.440
 Oh, so um...

00:30:42.440 --> 00:30:43.440
 Was he an escape artist?

00:30:43.440 --> 00:30:44.440
 He was an escape artist.

00:30:44.440 --> 00:30:45.440
 Yeah.

00:30:45.440 --> 00:30:48.720
 He became a guy who would escape from boxes.

00:30:48.720 --> 00:30:49.720
 That's great.

00:30:49.720 --> 00:30:51.160
 Tell his story and then do the escape.

00:30:51.160 --> 00:30:52.160
 Cool.

00:30:52.160 --> 00:30:53.160
 Wow.

00:30:53.160 --> 00:30:54.160
 That's so cool.

00:30:54.160 --> 00:30:59.400
 Um, have you guys heard of Michel Vajour, who's, um, he was someone who was in prison

00:30:59.400 --> 00:31:04.560
 for bank robbery in Paris, and this was in 1986.

00:31:04.560 --> 00:31:10.840
 And he got his wife to spend months and months learning to fly a helicopter so that she could

00:31:10.840 --> 00:31:11.840
 rescue him.

00:31:11.840 --> 00:31:16.560
 Um, so I say he got her, maybe she volunteered, I don't know how the letters went.

00:31:16.560 --> 00:31:17.960
 James, your wife flies a helicopter.

00:31:17.960 --> 00:31:18.960
 Yeah, she is.

00:31:18.960 --> 00:31:19.960
 What are you planning?

00:31:19.960 --> 00:31:20.960
 What are you planning?

00:31:20.960 --> 00:31:21.960
 You think I made friends with that chimp?

00:31:21.960 --> 00:31:25.960
 You're going to steal some steel, aren't you?

00:31:25.960 --> 00:31:26.960
 You're going to steal some steel.

00:31:26.960 --> 00:31:31.720
 I'm going to go into the chimp prison and my wife's going to fly me out.

00:31:31.720 --> 00:31:35.720
 She's going to lower a duffel bag from a helicopter.

00:31:35.720 --> 00:31:41.680
 I can't believe my entire scheme has been explained on this podcast.

00:31:41.680 --> 00:31:47.040
 That might be, like, the most cool backs to different bits of the show anyone's ever

00:31:47.040 --> 00:31:48.040
 done.

00:31:48.040 --> 00:31:49.040
 That was lovely.

00:31:49.040 --> 00:31:52.200
 So I opened a deed, spent months learning to fly a helicopter, did fly a helicopter,

00:31:52.200 --> 00:31:54.480
 and picked him up from the roof of the prison.

00:31:54.480 --> 00:31:59.000
 And the way he got onto the roof, which is the only thing that he needed to do, was by

00:31:59.000 --> 00:32:04.600
 tricking the guards by painting some nectarines and making them look like grenades, which

00:32:04.600 --> 00:32:05.600
 I don't know how you do.

00:32:05.600 --> 00:32:07.160
 You've got to paint shadows on them.

00:32:07.160 --> 00:32:08.160
 Oh, painted green.

00:32:08.160 --> 00:32:09.160
 Yeah, green.

00:32:09.160 --> 00:32:10.160
 I think, yeah, if you're under this...

00:32:10.160 --> 00:32:11.160
 That's how far away you are, yeah.

00:32:11.160 --> 00:32:16.040
 I thought you meant he'd painted nectarines onto the roof of the prison and said, "Oh,

00:32:16.040 --> 00:32:22.320
 can I go pick those nectarines?"

00:32:22.320 --> 00:32:27.880
 Okay, it is time for fact number three, and that is James.

00:32:27.880 --> 00:32:33.640
 Okay, and my fact this week is that in Tudor times, the guy in the crow's nest of a warship

00:32:33.640 --> 00:32:35.840
 had to be really good at darts.

00:32:35.840 --> 00:32:36.840
 Right.

00:32:36.840 --> 00:32:42.480
 Okay, so, is the deck of the ship painted like a dartboard?

00:32:42.480 --> 00:32:43.480
 Oh, yeah.

00:32:43.480 --> 00:32:46.480
 And why is he throwing darts down at the people, his colleagues?

00:32:46.480 --> 00:32:47.480
 Yeah, good point.

00:32:47.480 --> 00:32:48.480
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:32:48.480 --> 00:32:52.240
 Is it, if you see another massive ship and you think there's no way we can win this,

00:32:52.240 --> 00:32:54.800
 why not challenge them to a game of darts and stuff?

00:32:54.800 --> 00:32:55.800
 Yeah?

00:32:55.800 --> 00:32:56.800
 You have to accept, don't they?

00:32:56.800 --> 00:32:57.800
 Under naval law.

00:32:57.800 --> 00:32:58.800
 Yeah, yeah.

00:32:58.800 --> 00:33:00.160
 No, it's not that.

00:33:00.160 --> 00:33:05.920
 This is because there are things called fire arrows, and they were also known as darts of

00:33:05.920 --> 00:33:11.160
 wildfire, and they were kept by the guy in the crow's nest, and you would launch them

00:33:11.160 --> 00:33:14.960
 at the other ship and hopefully set fire to it when you're in battle.

00:33:14.960 --> 00:33:15.960
 They were like...

00:33:15.960 --> 00:33:18.240
 So bigger, these aren't darts that would be permitted in your local pub?

00:33:18.240 --> 00:33:19.240
 They're not.

00:33:19.240 --> 00:33:20.240
 They were a bit bigger than that.

00:33:20.240 --> 00:33:21.240
 Right.

00:33:21.240 --> 00:33:25.840
 They were more spear-sized than dart-sized, but they were called darts of wildfire, and

00:33:25.840 --> 00:33:30.880
 I read this in, I reckon this is the book with the least encouraging title that I got

00:33:30.880 --> 00:33:32.960
 the most facts from ever.

00:33:32.960 --> 00:33:39.760
 It's called Darts in England 1900 to 1939 by Patrick Chaplin, but it's full of amazing

00:33:39.760 --> 00:33:40.760
 facts, and I read it in there.

00:33:40.760 --> 00:33:45.240
 Well, Chaplin was also straying way outside its brief, as in 1900 to 1939, these were

00:33:45.240 --> 00:33:46.400
 not used in the First World War.

00:33:46.400 --> 00:33:48.280
 No, no they weren't.

00:33:48.280 --> 00:33:53.400
 He did give a little bit of exposition before he got to 1900.

00:33:53.400 --> 00:33:57.560
 So yeah, a bit unfair for me to call them darts, possibly although they did call them

00:33:57.560 --> 00:33:58.560
 darts.

00:33:58.560 --> 00:34:01.520
 Also a bit unfair for me to call them crow's nests, because there was no crow's nests at

00:34:01.520 --> 00:34:04.000
 the time either.

00:34:04.000 --> 00:34:08.520
 The term crow's nest didn't exist in the 16th century, so they would have been called mass

00:34:08.520 --> 00:34:09.520
 tops.

00:34:09.520 --> 00:34:12.280
 And was it just a platform you put at the top of the name?

00:34:12.280 --> 00:34:16.880
 Actually it was a little kind of barrel thing, but they just didn't call it that, and so

00:34:16.880 --> 00:34:21.640
 they used these on the Merry Rose for instance, and if you go to the Merry Rose Museum, they

00:34:21.640 --> 00:34:25.400
 say that their crow's nest there shouldn't technically be called that, it should be called

00:34:25.400 --> 00:34:26.400
 a mass top.

00:34:26.400 --> 00:34:27.400
 That's interesting.

00:34:27.400 --> 00:34:29.000
 I assumed it was a really old term.

00:34:29.000 --> 00:34:32.160
 I assumed it comes exactly from that period, you know, the golden age of sailor.

00:34:32.160 --> 00:34:33.480
 You'd have thought so, but no.

00:34:33.480 --> 00:34:36.520
 But there's, and I didn't even write his name down because I thought it was such a pointless

00:34:36.520 --> 00:34:40.520
 or meaningless thing to invent, because there's always credited the guy who invented the crow's

00:34:40.520 --> 00:34:44.040
 nest, and it is in the 19th century, and you'd think, well, crow's nest exists, what did

00:34:44.040 --> 00:34:45.040
 he do?

00:34:45.040 --> 00:34:46.040
 He gave them a name, didn't he?

00:34:46.040 --> 00:34:48.040
 Excuse me, Anna, are you referring to William Scorseseania?

00:34:48.040 --> 00:34:50.040
 I certainly am.

00:34:50.040 --> 00:34:52.000
 Give him his rightful name.

00:34:52.000 --> 00:34:53.600
 He's not alive to get pissed off.

00:34:53.600 --> 00:34:56.280
 Let's talk about William Scorseseania.

00:34:56.280 --> 00:35:04.280
 So he was a whaler and an Arctic explorer, and yeah, he's credited with developing the

00:35:04.280 --> 00:35:07.600
 crow's nest or creating the thing, which was first properly called a crow's nest, and if

00:35:07.600 --> 00:35:10.560
 you were up there, you were a barrel man, that was the thing.

00:35:10.560 --> 00:35:17.280
 And he had a great family, so he had a son, William Scorseseania, who was also an explorer,

00:35:17.280 --> 00:35:23.080
 and Scorseseania was one of the first people to scientifically record what snowflakes looked

00:35:23.080 --> 00:35:24.080
 like.

00:35:24.080 --> 00:35:25.080
 Cool.

00:35:25.080 --> 00:35:26.080
 Yeah.

00:35:26.080 --> 00:35:29.040
 He once called a polar bear and allegedly brought it to Whitby.

00:35:29.040 --> 00:35:31.120
 I'm not completely sure that's true.

00:35:31.120 --> 00:35:35.160
 No, from Whitby, weren't they, the Scorseseania.

00:35:35.160 --> 00:35:40.200
 And the book, "Northern Lights" by Philip Pullman, there is a Texan explorer in that

00:35:40.200 --> 00:35:47.340
 book called Lee Scorsbe, who is named after and inspired by William Scorsbe, so the name

00:35:47.340 --> 00:35:48.340
 lives on.

00:35:48.340 --> 00:35:55.160
 William Scorsbe's wife was called Lady Mary, and Lady was her first name, Mary was her

00:35:55.160 --> 00:35:59.480
 surname, and because she was born on Lady Day, so they called her Lady Mary.

00:35:59.480 --> 00:36:03.000
 Oh, and because they wanted to trick society into embracing them.

00:36:03.000 --> 00:36:04.000
 Oh, maybe.

00:36:04.000 --> 00:36:06.000
 She had married Lord Timothy Dexter.

00:36:06.000 --> 00:36:07.000
 Yes.

00:36:07.000 --> 00:36:08.000
 They could have been Lord and Lady.

00:36:08.000 --> 00:36:10.240
 What was Lady Day, and does it still exist?

00:36:10.240 --> 00:36:17.800
 Lady Day is a religious day for the Virgin Mary, and also they did a sculpture of a crow's

00:36:17.800 --> 00:36:24.800
 nest in Whitby in 1994, but local historian Norman Nichols said, "It looked more like

00:36:24.800 --> 00:36:32.040
 a margarine tub than a crow's nest, and even the bird on top is of an unknown species."

00:36:32.040 --> 00:36:37.960
 Also, there are two men in the tub, whereas a crow's nest would only ever have one person,

00:36:37.960 --> 00:36:42.120
 and one of the people's looking through binoculars and they weren't used on ships until the 20th

00:36:42.120 --> 00:36:43.120
 century.

00:36:43.120 --> 00:36:45.960
 That's a hell of a fact check on a statue.

00:36:45.960 --> 00:36:49.680
 And the council said that it wasn't supposed to be accurate, it was just...

00:36:49.680 --> 00:36:51.160
 That's a cop-out as well.

00:36:51.160 --> 00:36:54.840
 The winning entry and the competition, and they just happened to put it in Whitby because

00:36:54.840 --> 00:36:56.160
 it was near the sea.

00:36:56.160 --> 00:37:02.480
 That was Dan's excuse for most podcasts, but it's not meant to be accurate.

00:37:02.480 --> 00:37:08.320
 So I guess the upgrades that were done to the crow's nest in the 1800s were they had nooks

00:37:08.320 --> 00:37:12.440
 or racks included, don't they, to accommodate your telescope, the very much 19th century

00:37:12.440 --> 00:37:18.760
 binoculars, and signal flags, so you could signal down to the people on the deck to say

00:37:18.760 --> 00:37:22.680
 there's a shark coming or whatever, and a speaking trumpet.

00:37:22.680 --> 00:37:26.000
 So you could shout to your crew and you'd have a trumpet up there, and then often on

00:37:26.000 --> 00:37:28.920
 deck the captain would have another trumpet to shout back.

00:37:28.920 --> 00:37:29.920
 That's great.

00:37:29.920 --> 00:37:30.920
 That's wonderful.

00:37:30.920 --> 00:37:35.600
 And actually, apparently you had big painted arrows too, and I think painted so that they

00:37:35.600 --> 00:37:37.680
 showed up so you could see them on deck.

00:37:37.680 --> 00:37:40.880
 And this was for pointing at a whale if you're on a wailing expedition.

00:37:40.880 --> 00:37:41.880
 What do you mean, sorry?

00:37:41.880 --> 00:37:43.120
 Where were the arrows painted?

00:37:43.120 --> 00:37:47.000
 I think that they were just painted a color, a bright color, so you'd make a long wail on

00:37:47.000 --> 00:37:48.000
 the ship.

00:37:48.000 --> 00:37:49.000
 Crow's nest.

00:37:49.000 --> 00:37:50.000
 Oh.

00:37:50.000 --> 00:37:51.000
 So you would hold an arrow, sorry.

00:37:51.000 --> 00:37:52.000
 Sorry, you're holding an arrow.

00:37:52.000 --> 00:37:53.000
 It's not a painter of an arrow.

00:37:53.000 --> 00:37:54.000
 That's cool.

00:37:54.000 --> 00:37:56.280
 Like someone who's trying to show you where there's a golf sail.

00:37:56.280 --> 00:37:57.280
 Yeah.

00:37:57.280 --> 00:37:59.080
 I just blank those people out.

00:37:59.080 --> 00:38:04.840
 And those guys, no, but those guys, they all originally had worked on ships because they

00:38:04.840 --> 00:38:07.720
 were better at pointing to things.

00:38:07.720 --> 00:38:11.720
 According to Penn State website, Penn State University, and I don't think this is true,

00:38:11.720 --> 00:38:16.880
 but it was on there, it said that the crow's nest used to actually contain a crow.

00:38:16.880 --> 00:38:17.880
 Okay.

00:38:17.880 --> 00:38:23.880
 And the navigator's because crows were used by, I know the Vikings use crows because if

00:38:23.880 --> 00:38:25.800
 you let one go, it'll go to land.

00:38:25.800 --> 00:38:27.400
 And so you can follow it to land.

00:38:27.400 --> 00:38:28.720
 That was, that was a thing.

00:38:28.720 --> 00:38:30.040
 I don't think that bit's true.

00:38:30.040 --> 00:38:34.960
 I think they were named because crows, generally speaking, build their nest quite high up at

00:38:34.960 --> 00:38:35.960
 the top of trees.

00:38:35.960 --> 00:38:36.960
 Looks like a bird's nest.

00:38:36.960 --> 00:38:37.960
 They look massive, don't they?

00:38:37.960 --> 00:38:38.960
 Yeah.

00:38:38.960 --> 00:38:39.960
 Exactly.

00:38:39.960 --> 00:38:43.480
 Although there was a study in British Columbia that found 45% of crow's nests are built on

00:38:43.480 --> 00:38:44.480
 the ground.

00:38:44.480 --> 00:38:45.480
 Why?

00:38:45.480 --> 00:38:47.480
 Because there's only a few myths there.

00:38:47.480 --> 00:38:50.600
 So really all the chips crows nest should have been just on the...

00:38:50.600 --> 00:38:53.720
 45% of them should have been crows.

00:38:53.720 --> 00:38:54.720
 That's great.

00:38:54.720 --> 00:38:55.720
 And you wouldn't need the trumpet.

00:38:55.720 --> 00:38:56.720
 No.

00:38:56.720 --> 00:38:57.720
 Yeah.

00:38:57.720 --> 00:38:58.720
 Yeah.

00:38:58.720 --> 00:38:59.720
 The Titanic had a crow's nest.

00:38:59.720 --> 00:39:00.720
 Did it?

00:39:00.720 --> 00:39:06.240
 And it was, it was tragically, it wasn't properly functional on the night the ship hit the iceberg.

00:39:06.240 --> 00:39:07.240
 Right.

00:39:07.240 --> 00:39:09.320
 So there were two lookouts, official lookouts on the Titanic.

00:39:09.320 --> 00:39:11.920
 They were called Frederick Fleet and Reginald Lee.

00:39:11.920 --> 00:39:16.480
 And this actually might be the whole cause of the Titanic sinking to a degree.

00:39:16.480 --> 00:39:19.840
 So the ship's second officer was a guy called David Blair, right?

00:39:19.840 --> 00:39:24.120
 And he was only on board from Belfast, where, you know, launched to Southampton.

00:39:24.120 --> 00:39:25.120
 Yeah.

00:39:25.120 --> 00:39:26.120
 And then it was going Southampton to New York.

00:39:26.120 --> 00:39:27.120
 Yeah.

00:39:27.120 --> 00:39:28.120
 But he got off at Southampton.

00:39:28.120 --> 00:39:29.120
 Okay.

00:39:29.120 --> 00:39:35.840
 And when he got off the ship, he took with him a small key and the key opened the cabinet

00:39:35.840 --> 00:39:39.440
 in the crow's nest, which contained the binoculars and the telescope.

00:39:39.440 --> 00:39:43.960
 So the lookouts decided, shall we break open this lock?

00:39:43.960 --> 00:39:44.960
 No.

00:39:44.960 --> 00:39:46.960
 They just, they were just relying on the naked eye.

00:39:46.960 --> 00:39:47.960
 Yeah.

00:39:47.960 --> 00:39:52.080
 And they, and Frederick Fleet survived the sinking and he went to, you know, the hearings

00:39:52.080 --> 00:39:56.080
 afterwards and at the hearings, he said, yeah, it would have been very useful to have the

00:39:56.080 --> 00:39:58.160
 binoculars or the telescope.

00:39:58.160 --> 00:40:00.440
 And we might have been able to get out of the way.

00:40:00.440 --> 00:40:04.200
 And that key has survived, though, because Blair, who had got off the ship, kept it as

00:40:04.200 --> 00:40:05.840
 a souvenir, memento, whatever.

00:40:05.840 --> 00:40:06.840
 Really?

00:40:06.840 --> 00:40:07.840
 Chips now use it to break people.

00:40:07.840 --> 00:40:08.840
 Yeah.

00:40:08.840 --> 00:40:09.840
 Yeah.

00:40:09.840 --> 00:40:10.840
 It was auctioned off in 2007.

00:40:10.840 --> 00:40:12.400
 I think they got that wrong in Titanic.

00:40:12.400 --> 00:40:16.040
 I've got a real vision in Titanic of the lookout looking through a telescope.

00:40:16.040 --> 00:40:22.360
 So, James Cameron, take a look, maybe go back into an edit.

00:40:22.360 --> 00:40:23.880
 I've got a lot of darts.

00:40:23.880 --> 00:40:25.880
 Oh, let's talk about that.

00:40:25.880 --> 00:40:27.380
 Darts stuff.

00:40:27.380 --> 00:40:32.720
 This, the guy that you got this fact from, James, Patrick Chaplin, has a fantastic website

00:40:32.720 --> 00:40:38.360
 where he goes heavily into the world of darts, learned so much from him.

00:40:38.360 --> 00:40:43.360
 One interesting thing that he pointed out is there's a conception that darts became

00:40:43.360 --> 00:40:49.600
 a big game in this country when a man called Bigfoot was able to say, well, no, but this

00:40:49.600 --> 00:40:50.600
 is real.

00:40:50.600 --> 00:40:51.600
 This is a real Bigfoot.

00:40:51.600 --> 00:40:56.640
 But how do you find it?

00:40:56.640 --> 00:41:03.080
 William Bigfoot Anakin in 1908, courts in Leeds were saying that darts is gambling because

00:41:03.080 --> 00:41:06.800
 it's simply just throwing it as a gamble on where it's completely random where it lands.

00:41:06.800 --> 00:41:12.320
 And in order to prove that that wasn't the case, Bigfoot was brought into court and he

00:41:12.320 --> 00:41:16.520
 was asked to throw specific three double twenties, which he managed to do.

00:41:16.520 --> 00:41:21.000
 And in doing so, showed it was a game of skill and that meant, ah, okay, this is a sport,

00:41:21.000 --> 00:41:23.040
 therefore you are allowed to bet on it.

00:41:23.040 --> 00:41:27.600
 This in the history of darting is often presented as it changed it for the whole country.

00:41:27.600 --> 00:41:31.160
 The seminal moment, the truth is it was more localized and it helped in a very specific

00:41:31.160 --> 00:41:32.160
 case.

00:41:32.160 --> 00:41:33.160
 In Leeds.

00:41:33.160 --> 00:41:34.160
 In Leeds, exactly.

00:41:34.160 --> 00:41:37.840
 So there, this story, we're not sure if it's true or not.

00:41:37.840 --> 00:41:43.720
 So William Anakin's grandson says it is true, but all the magistrate records from Leeds

00:41:43.720 --> 00:41:45.520
 from 1908 are missing.

00:41:45.520 --> 00:41:46.520
 Yeah.

00:41:46.520 --> 00:41:47.520
 Suspicious.

00:41:47.520 --> 00:41:48.520
 Suspicious.

00:41:48.520 --> 00:41:53.640
 They've been spotted halfway up the Himalayas actually, but it's never been confirmed whether

00:41:53.640 --> 00:41:54.640
 they were really...

00:41:54.640 --> 00:41:57.200
 There's a blurry document, but you can't quite make out the words on it.

00:41:57.200 --> 00:42:01.760
 The story is that they just told him what to hit and perhaps it was twenties and stuff

00:42:01.760 --> 00:42:05.800
 like that, but then everyone else in the court would shout out a number and then he'd have

00:42:05.800 --> 00:42:06.800
 to hit that.

00:42:06.800 --> 00:42:09.960
 So someone goes seven and then he'd hit the seven and someone shout out nine and he hit

00:42:09.960 --> 00:42:10.960
 the nine.

00:42:10.960 --> 00:42:11.960
 That's a great story.

00:42:11.960 --> 00:42:12.960
 I like that.

00:42:12.960 --> 00:42:16.040
 There was a study done about what you should aim for in darts.

00:42:16.040 --> 00:42:21.000
 It was done, it was published in the Royal Statistical Society Journal and basically it was saying

00:42:21.000 --> 00:42:26.680
 you should only aim for treble twenty if you're a very skilled player because if you are not

00:42:26.680 --> 00:42:31.600
 a skilled player and you aim for treble twenty you'll average ten point two points per throw

00:42:31.600 --> 00:42:34.560
 and if you throw totally randomly you'll average twelve point eight points per throw.

00:42:34.560 --> 00:42:37.680
 So you'll actually do less well than average because on the either side of triple twenty

00:42:37.680 --> 00:42:41.360
 there's a five and a one, so you risk getting low scores.

00:42:41.360 --> 00:42:44.320
 But that's a very unambitious way of thinking about darts.

00:42:44.320 --> 00:42:48.440
 It implies that no one can ever improve from the low base and just like, unless you're

00:42:48.440 --> 00:42:51.600
 a natural savol, you just play for your twelve.

00:42:51.600 --> 00:42:56.640
 It just says why don't you try and improve on the baby slope down here with, you know,

00:42:56.640 --> 00:43:00.080
 the nineteen which has less dangerous numbers around it.

00:43:00.080 --> 00:43:04.120
 I was reading about what a sort of man sport it was, you know, women weren't allowed to

00:43:04.120 --> 00:43:08.800
 compete with the men in their competitions as well as there wasn't really a women's

00:43:08.800 --> 00:43:14.760
 body for it for a very long time and there was a big moment for women's darts and it's

00:43:14.760 --> 00:43:20.160
 all down to the Queen Mother because the Queen Mother went and played with the King at the

00:43:20.160 --> 00:43:26.520
 time a game of darts and she beat him and she was standing a foot closer to the dark

00:43:26.520 --> 00:43:30.760
 board but she beat him twenty one by nineteen and afterwards there were headlines around

00:43:30.760 --> 00:43:31.760
 the country.

00:43:31.760 --> 00:43:33.240
 Sorry, she beat him twenty one by nineteen.

00:43:33.240 --> 00:43:34.720
 They both threw three darts.

00:43:34.720 --> 00:43:35.720
 I see.

00:43:35.720 --> 00:43:40.840
 And this was in the thirties, we should say, in the 1930s and and so the headlines everywhere

00:43:40.840 --> 00:43:44.360
 women flock to follow the Queen's lead at darts and there was this moment where it looked

00:43:44.360 --> 00:43:48.520
 quite cool because it meant that women and men were playing together, different classes

00:43:48.520 --> 00:43:49.520
 were playing together.

00:43:49.520 --> 00:43:54.720
 It sort of transcended everything and then Bloody World War two broke out and and that

00:43:54.720 --> 00:43:56.600
 sort of put a stop to things for a while.

00:43:56.600 --> 00:44:00.360
 People stopped playing darts and then they forgot about this these Halcyon days of when

00:44:00.360 --> 00:44:04.520
 everyone came together to play darts because I think darts playing tripled after the Queen

00:44:04.520 --> 00:44:06.000
 Mother played it for a while.

00:44:06.000 --> 00:44:09.320
 But then but you say, you know, women didn't used to be able to compete against men.

00:44:09.320 --> 00:44:11.680
 But I mean, in almost no sports can women compete against men.

00:44:11.680 --> 00:44:17.240
 And actually darts is one of the very few where they can now is the most famous female

00:44:17.240 --> 00:44:18.240
 darts player.

00:44:18.240 --> 00:44:23.360
 Has she just won a tournament couple of years ago, she played in the world championships

00:44:23.360 --> 00:44:26.880
 and she beat a couple of men and she played in the men specifically the men's.

00:44:26.880 --> 00:44:29.320
 So she entered as a woman into the men's championship.

00:44:29.320 --> 00:44:33.840
 And she she says she gets a lot of shit from the female league because they feel like she's

00:44:33.840 --> 00:44:35.640
 not taking their league seriously.

00:44:35.640 --> 00:44:38.440
 I read an interview with her recently where she said you can understand that.

00:44:38.440 --> 00:44:40.720
 I think that's a complicated issue.

00:44:40.720 --> 00:44:45.320
 Lisa Ashton as well from Bolton, I should mention her who's the best female darts player.

00:44:45.320 --> 00:44:48.560
 One interesting thing that could happen to the darts player and this is something that

00:44:48.560 --> 00:44:51.920
 has been observed in the older generations of professional darts.

00:44:51.920 --> 00:44:52.920
 It's called dartitis.

00:44:52.920 --> 00:44:53.920
 Yeah.

00:44:53.920 --> 00:44:54.920
 That's really bad.

00:44:54.920 --> 00:44:59.840
 Dartitis is a motor neurone disease without any explanation.

00:44:59.840 --> 00:45:01.640
 Some people have described it as sort of the yips.

00:45:01.640 --> 00:45:03.520
 You just it's the yips for that.

00:45:03.520 --> 00:45:04.520
 Yeah, exactly.

00:45:04.520 --> 00:45:08.560
 And you basically start throwing, but your brain won't let you let go of the dart.

00:45:08.560 --> 00:45:12.680
 And you just have this kind of mental barrier that stops you from being able to throw a

00:45:12.680 --> 00:45:13.680
 dart.

00:45:13.680 --> 00:45:14.680
 It's terrifying.

00:45:14.680 --> 00:45:18.520
 And darts players are terrified of it, I think the yips is the same as choking.

00:45:18.520 --> 00:45:19.520
 Right?

00:45:19.520 --> 00:45:21.060
 No, the yips is actually the same.

00:45:21.060 --> 00:45:23.360
 So if you're in golf at least, this is the yips.

00:45:23.360 --> 00:45:27.880
 So if you need to hit a very short putt, so the ball into the hole, your brain just won't

00:45:27.880 --> 00:45:30.160
 let you push the club through the ball.

00:45:30.160 --> 00:45:32.880
 You'll kind of get close to it and you'll just kind of freeze up.

00:45:32.880 --> 00:45:33.880
 And yeah, it's all.

00:45:33.880 --> 00:45:34.880
 And how common is this?

00:45:34.880 --> 00:45:35.880
 Does this happen to people sporadically?

00:45:35.880 --> 00:45:37.280
 Or is it if you've got it, you've got it?

00:45:37.280 --> 00:45:38.280
 No, you can't.

00:45:38.280 --> 00:45:42.720
 So Eric Bristo, who is seen, I mean, James, you know darts more, but he's basically seen

00:45:42.720 --> 00:45:44.560
 as one of the greatest if not the greatest.

00:45:44.560 --> 00:45:45.560
 One of the greatest.

00:45:45.560 --> 00:45:46.560
 Yeah, one of the.

00:45:46.560 --> 00:45:51.400
 Great for darts and he got it on his fifth world championship.

00:45:51.400 --> 00:45:56.280
 So he had he had dartitis and he managed to get himself out of it and he went back to

00:45:56.280 --> 00:45:57.280
 number one in the world.

00:45:57.280 --> 00:45:58.280
 But he says he had it.

00:45:58.280 --> 00:45:59.280
 He definitely had it.

00:45:59.280 --> 00:46:00.280
 Yeah.

00:46:00.280 --> 00:46:01.280
 It's amazing.

00:46:01.280 --> 00:46:05.740
 Sid Waddell, who was a very famous, brilliant darts commentator, famously said of Eric Bristo.

00:46:05.740 --> 00:46:10.240
 When Alexander the Great was 33, he cried salt tears because there were no more worlds

00:46:10.240 --> 00:46:11.680
 to conquer.

00:46:11.680 --> 00:46:19.440
 Eric Bristo is only 27.

00:46:19.440 --> 00:46:27.000
 Okay, it is time for our final fact of the show.

00:46:27.000 --> 00:46:28.680
 And that is Andy.

00:46:28.680 --> 00:46:32.440
 My fact is there is a 50 percent chance that you have a caterpillar in your mouth.

00:46:32.440 --> 00:46:34.760
 What are you talking to?

00:46:34.760 --> 00:46:36.600
 So it's everyone.

00:46:36.600 --> 00:46:37.600
 You're not addressing.

00:46:37.600 --> 00:46:41.040
 I thought you were looking at me and I thought maybe no, no, no, no, it's not it's not a judge

00:46:41.040 --> 00:46:42.040
 personal judgment.

00:46:42.040 --> 00:46:43.040
 Absolutely.

00:46:43.040 --> 00:46:44.040
 You know, it's not a personal hygiene thing.

00:46:44.040 --> 00:46:46.760
 As far as I'm aware, is that why sometimes the butterfly will eventually fly out of my

00:46:46.760 --> 00:46:47.760
 mouth?

00:46:47.760 --> 00:46:48.760
 That's right.

00:46:48.760 --> 00:46:53.120
 So these caterpillars, they are bacterial caterpillars.

00:46:53.120 --> 00:46:58.280
 So they are multicellular bacteria, which are all in the line, so they look like caterpillars.

00:46:58.280 --> 00:46:59.600
 That's why they've got their name.

00:46:59.600 --> 00:47:00.600
 Okay.

00:47:00.600 --> 00:47:01.600
 Yeah.

00:47:01.600 --> 00:47:02.600
 And this is from a trick.

00:47:02.600 --> 00:47:03.600
 It's a trick.

00:47:03.600 --> 00:47:07.880
 It's a brilliant website called Small Things Considered and Jennifer Fraser wrote an article

00:47:07.880 --> 00:47:08.880
 about it.

00:47:08.880 --> 00:47:09.880
 I read it recently.

00:47:09.880 --> 00:47:13.800
 It was featured on a website called The Browser, which I read, which I love.

00:47:13.800 --> 00:47:15.240
 And these are these bacterial caterpillars.

00:47:15.240 --> 00:47:18.720
 They cling onto the inside of your cheek and they eat you.

00:47:18.720 --> 00:47:23.000
 You are the food and they just live inside your mouth and about half of people have them.

00:47:23.000 --> 00:47:25.520
 And they're a family of microbes, which are so hard to pronounce.

00:47:25.520 --> 00:47:26.960
 I'm going to have a go at it.

00:47:26.960 --> 00:47:29.960
 It's nice, siriaceae.

00:47:29.960 --> 00:47:30.960
 To see you.

00:47:30.960 --> 00:47:31.960
 Nice siriaceae.

00:47:31.960 --> 00:47:32.960
 Nice.

00:47:32.960 --> 00:47:35.080
 There we go.

00:47:35.080 --> 00:47:36.080
 Yeah.

00:47:36.080 --> 00:47:43.600
 And they've evolved to live in our oral cavity or our mouth, as the common saying has it.

00:47:43.600 --> 00:47:49.640
 The most famous member of the nice siriaceae family is nice siriaceae gonorrheaae.

00:47:49.640 --> 00:47:53.120
 Oh, not so nice siriaceae.

00:47:53.120 --> 00:47:55.360
 So gonorrheaae is part of this family of bacteria.

00:47:55.360 --> 00:48:01.240
 But they named after a guy called Albert Neisser, who is a German physician.

00:48:01.240 --> 00:48:05.520
 And he was the one who the gonorrhea bacteria was named after.

00:48:05.520 --> 00:48:08.000
 He did discover it.

00:48:08.000 --> 00:48:09.720
 But yeah, it's not the greatest thing.

00:48:09.720 --> 00:48:13.640
 He also co-discovered the causative agent of leprosy as well.

00:48:13.640 --> 00:48:14.640
 Wow.

00:48:14.640 --> 00:48:16.640
 It's called, the other guy was Hanson, I think.

00:48:16.640 --> 00:48:20.120
 It's called Hanson's disease now, but he was the other guy who found that.

00:48:20.120 --> 00:48:22.960
 Two really palatable and attractive things.

00:48:22.960 --> 00:48:23.960
 I know.

00:48:23.960 --> 00:48:27.280
 But was there ever a Mr. gonorrhea or was that part of the...

00:48:27.280 --> 00:48:31.920
 Gonorrhea means something out, rhea means like shooting out like diarrhea, doesn't it?

00:48:31.920 --> 00:48:35.120
 And I can't remember what gonorr means, but yeah, it means something else.

00:48:35.120 --> 00:48:41.080
 But the other thing about Neisser, again, not a very nice thing, he did some quite unethical

00:48:41.080 --> 00:48:46.640
 clinical trials on syphilis, putting it into patients in the 1890s.

00:48:46.640 --> 00:48:52.400
 And because he did that, the universal rule regarding human experiments and the ethical

00:48:52.400 --> 00:48:56.560
 rules that we have now on human experiments came in because of his experiments he did

00:48:56.560 --> 00:48:57.560
 that.

00:48:57.560 --> 00:48:58.560
 Really?

00:48:58.560 --> 00:48:59.560
 Yeah.

00:48:59.560 --> 00:49:03.160
 So we've got about, according to a study I read, 700 different species of bacteria in

00:49:03.160 --> 00:49:04.160
 our mouth.

00:49:04.160 --> 00:49:05.160
 Absolutely.

00:49:05.160 --> 00:49:06.160
 Any given type.

00:49:06.160 --> 00:49:07.160
 A caterpillar, maybe one of them.

00:49:07.160 --> 00:49:09.840
 And some of them stick to their own patch of mouth.

00:49:09.840 --> 00:49:13.400
 Your mouth roof bacteria will be very different to your cheek bacteria, for example.

00:49:13.400 --> 00:49:14.400
 It's amazing, isn't it?

00:49:14.400 --> 00:49:18.960
 And yeah, they just live on different continents within your face, it's pretty amazing.

00:49:18.960 --> 00:49:25.000
 And also our mouth microbiome, our oral microbiome, is like our gut microbiome, right?

00:49:25.000 --> 00:49:29.040
 There's lots of talk about the gut microbiome, how everyone has their unique collection of

00:49:29.040 --> 00:49:34.720
 bacteria, colony of bacteria, and that helps you digest food and your immune system, etc.

00:49:34.720 --> 00:49:39.800
 But similarly in your mouth, you've got your unique oral microbiome, and it started building

00:49:39.800 --> 00:49:45.000
 up basically from the moment you were born, and it doesn't change that much.

00:49:45.000 --> 00:49:49.880
 So you'd think when you eat kind of food with certain bacteria in it, or when you put your

00:49:49.880 --> 00:49:54.240
 fingers in your mouth, or you don't wash your hands for ages, you'd think that you're

00:49:54.240 --> 00:50:00.080
 introducing new colonies, but they're just fought out because basically at birth you've

00:50:00.080 --> 00:50:03.880
 started forming this thing, and in fact in the womb, I found this really amazing, if

00:50:03.880 --> 00:50:09.880
 your mother had gum disease, or was a smoker, you are more likely to be born with pathogens

00:50:09.880 --> 00:50:12.920
 in your mouth that dispose you to cavities and stuff.

00:50:12.920 --> 00:50:13.920
 It's really interesting, isn't it?

00:50:13.920 --> 00:50:17.400
 They found that quite recently, because they thought that the first bacteria inside a baby

00:50:17.400 --> 00:50:22.080
 would have probably come vaginally, like as they came out, basically they thought a baby

00:50:22.080 --> 00:50:26.040
 would be quite sterile, but as they came out, they would pick up all of the bacteria and

00:50:26.040 --> 00:50:30.920
 stuff, but it turns out that the baby's already getting bacteria from the mother's mouth,

00:50:30.920 --> 00:50:35.200
 and somehow it's going from the mother's mouth down through placentally into the baby.

00:50:35.200 --> 00:50:36.200
 Incredible.

00:50:36.200 --> 00:50:39.920
 We're not quite sure how it happens, but because we know that the same species from one place

00:50:39.920 --> 00:50:41.520
 and the other, we know that's how it's coming.

00:50:41.520 --> 00:50:42.520
 That's incredible.

00:50:42.520 --> 00:50:45.400
 And into the baby's mouth, because it ends up, because these are bacteria that belong

00:50:45.400 --> 00:50:47.200
 in the mouth, so they find their way.

00:50:47.200 --> 00:50:48.200
 How do you find it?

00:50:48.200 --> 00:50:49.200
 It is incredible.

00:50:49.200 --> 00:50:53.480
 The thing that you said, Dan, about how different species live in different parts of your mouth,

00:50:53.480 --> 00:50:58.160
 they found that quite recently in a study where they had these fluorescent things, like

00:50:58.160 --> 00:51:01.880
 little tag markers that they put on different types of bacteria.

00:51:01.880 --> 00:51:06.960
 So if it was a gonorrhea bacteria, it would be blue, and if it was a stefacoccus, it'd

00:51:06.960 --> 00:51:11.920
 be red or whatever, and they took them all out and then saw what they were, and they

00:51:11.920 --> 00:51:14.280
 gave them different names because they saw patterns.

00:51:14.280 --> 00:51:17.920
 So you would have the caterpillar in your mouth, but you might also have a hedgehog,

00:51:17.920 --> 00:51:23.080
 a corn cob, or a cauliflower, and these are different types of bacterial colonies.

00:51:23.080 --> 00:51:27.960
 So all four of us here, the bacteria on our tongues are more similar to each other, aren't

00:51:27.960 --> 00:51:30.600
 they, than the bacteria on our own teeth?

00:51:30.600 --> 00:51:31.600
 Because we make out so much.

00:51:31.600 --> 00:51:32.600
 That's right.

00:51:32.600 --> 00:51:33.600
 Yeah.

00:51:33.600 --> 00:51:34.600
 That's exactly it.

00:51:34.600 --> 00:51:37.560
 It's how we keep this vibe between us and we wrap our teeth.

00:51:37.560 --> 00:51:38.560
 It's a pretty show-maker.

00:51:38.560 --> 00:51:44.240
 But if you kiss someone, your tongues will be chatting to each other, but they are more

00:51:44.240 --> 00:51:46.840
 similar than your own tongue will be with your gums.

00:51:46.840 --> 00:51:47.840
 So romantic.

00:51:47.840 --> 00:51:48.840
 Oh, you're kidding.

00:51:48.840 --> 00:51:49.840
 Yeah.

00:51:49.840 --> 00:51:51.840
 Maybe our tongues could chat to each other.

00:51:51.840 --> 00:51:54.320
 Sounds quite French, doesn't it?

00:51:54.320 --> 00:51:55.320
 Yeah.

00:51:55.320 --> 00:51:56.320
 Do you know what?

00:51:56.320 --> 00:51:57.320
 Eating sweets.

00:51:57.320 --> 00:51:58.320
 Oh, yeah.

00:51:58.320 --> 00:51:59.320
 Kids listening.

00:51:59.320 --> 00:52:00.320
 And adults.

00:52:00.320 --> 00:52:01.320
 That's allowed.

00:52:01.320 --> 00:52:02.320
 Yeah.

00:52:02.320 --> 00:52:03.320
 And adults, yeah.

00:52:03.320 --> 00:52:04.320
 So I'll patch kids, Andy.

00:52:04.320 --> 00:52:05.320
 Love 'em.

00:52:05.320 --> 00:52:08.000
 But as an adult, you can eat whatever sweets you like, whereas as a kid, your parents often

00:52:08.000 --> 00:52:09.840
 say, "Don't, you'll get holes in your teeth."

00:52:09.840 --> 00:52:10.840
 Yeah.

00:52:10.840 --> 00:52:11.840
 It doesn't cause cavities.

00:52:11.840 --> 00:52:12.840
 What?

00:52:12.840 --> 00:52:13.840
 Are you sure?

00:52:13.840 --> 00:52:14.840
 Yeah.

00:52:14.840 --> 00:52:15.840
 Well.

00:52:15.840 --> 00:52:17.840
 I have to count this.

00:52:17.840 --> 00:52:20.200
 Wait, wait for the backtrack.

00:52:20.200 --> 00:52:26.020
 So basically, the way the cavities are formed are when bacteria living in our mouth digest

00:52:26.020 --> 00:52:32.080
 things that we eat, and then when they digest them, they excrete acidity, makes them very

00:52:32.080 --> 00:52:36.440
 acidic, and it's the acidity which rots away at your teeth.

00:52:36.440 --> 00:52:44.360
 And some bacteria do like carbohydrates, but they don't prefer a sweet to an apple or

00:52:44.360 --> 00:52:45.360
 some grain.

00:52:45.360 --> 00:52:50.560
 I don't think there's a connection between eating loads of quality street or whatever.

00:52:50.560 --> 00:52:59.080
 But it is true that children are likely to snack on sweets, then some grain, as in...

00:52:59.080 --> 00:53:01.200
 I'm sure you were very popular in the playground, Anna.

00:53:01.200 --> 00:53:02.400
 Anna's there at the pick-and-mix.

00:53:02.400 --> 00:53:05.600
 Oh, you know, maybe some book wheat would be nice.

00:53:05.600 --> 00:53:09.080
 I was a very advanced child.

00:53:09.080 --> 00:53:10.080
 Yeah.

00:53:10.080 --> 00:53:11.280
 Look, that's a good point.

00:53:11.280 --> 00:53:16.760
 But I think also the problem is that if you were to eat, like, let's say peanuts or bread

00:53:16.760 --> 00:53:21.280
 or something, that's more like to get stuck in your teeth, whereas the sugar tends to just

00:53:21.280 --> 00:53:22.280
 disappear away.

00:53:22.280 --> 00:53:23.280
 Just a doll, doesn't it?

00:53:23.280 --> 00:53:24.280
 It goes on your throat.

00:53:24.280 --> 00:53:26.280
 So it would be quite a good advertising campaign to say, you know, if people are trying to

00:53:26.280 --> 00:53:30.200
 not get cavities in their teeth, bacteria are trying to have a poo in your mouth and

00:53:30.200 --> 00:53:32.760
 don't let them, you know, only let them do it at mealtimes.

00:53:32.760 --> 00:53:33.760
 Yeah, that's nice.

00:53:33.760 --> 00:53:34.760
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:53:34.760 --> 00:53:35.760
 Yeah.

00:53:35.760 --> 00:53:36.760
 That would be a motivational postcard.

00:53:36.760 --> 00:53:37.760
 Maybe a character.

00:53:37.760 --> 00:53:39.280
 You'd have like a bacterial character.

00:53:39.280 --> 00:53:40.280
 Yeah.

00:53:40.280 --> 00:53:41.280
 Yeah.

00:53:41.280 --> 00:53:45.280
 Goes into schools, you know, a giant bacteria does a poo on the floor.

00:53:45.280 --> 00:53:48.280
 Don't let me do this in your mouth.

00:53:48.280 --> 00:53:51.080
 And then it burns a hole in the floor.

00:53:51.080 --> 00:53:52.080
 Yeah.

00:53:52.080 --> 00:53:56.400
 I think this could be a good spinoff business for us.

00:53:56.400 --> 00:54:03.280
 I had a half my tooth fell out the other night in bed and I stopped shooting on the bed post.

00:54:03.280 --> 00:54:04.280
 Just so you know that.

00:54:04.280 --> 00:54:05.280
 That's the side.

00:54:05.280 --> 00:54:06.280
 The end is very dear.

00:54:06.280 --> 00:54:07.280
 I know.

00:54:07.280 --> 00:54:08.280
 I know.

00:54:08.280 --> 00:54:11.280
 I'm going to be a 38 year old man and my son, five years old, did our reaction because

00:54:11.280 --> 00:54:12.720
 I went, oh my God, I'm crumbling.

00:54:12.720 --> 00:54:13.720
 This is it.

00:54:13.720 --> 00:54:15.360
 My son, grab me, went, dad, you're so lucky.

00:54:15.360 --> 00:54:19.480
 Put that under the pillow and you're going to make tons of money by the morning.

00:54:19.480 --> 00:54:22.280
 But yeah, it just disappeared and I've been eating a lot of sweets because Halloween,

00:54:22.280 --> 00:54:24.680
 we got a huge hoard off the back of the trick of treating that we did.

00:54:24.680 --> 00:54:27.400
 I think there's a correlation causation thing here.

00:54:27.400 --> 00:54:28.400
 Yeah.

00:54:28.400 --> 00:54:29.400
 Must be right.

00:54:29.400 --> 00:54:30.400
 So half your tooth fell out.

00:54:30.400 --> 00:54:31.400
 Yeah, just fell out.

00:54:31.400 --> 00:54:32.400
 Yeah.

00:54:32.400 --> 00:54:33.400
 So you've only got half a tooth now.

00:54:33.400 --> 00:54:34.400
 Yeah, it's still the breast.

00:54:34.400 --> 00:54:35.400
 Are you serious?

00:54:35.400 --> 00:54:36.400
 Yeah, I'm not joking.

00:54:36.400 --> 00:54:37.400
 I feel like you're overly concerned here, Andy.

00:54:37.400 --> 00:54:38.400
 I feel like Dan needs quite urgent attention.

00:54:38.400 --> 00:54:39.400
 I feel like you're utterly concerned.

00:54:39.400 --> 00:54:48.520
 I have to say, because I've only got half a tooth at the back of my mouth because of

00:54:48.520 --> 00:54:51.800
 some dental work that I never got finished because it was coming too expensive and I

00:54:51.800 --> 00:54:56.120
 said to the dentist, it's only the back half of my tooth that I have for all the roots

00:54:56.120 --> 00:54:57.120
 are a little bit exposed.

00:54:57.120 --> 00:55:00.880
 And I said, if hypothetically I didn't come back and pay for you to put the crown on top

00:55:00.880 --> 00:55:02.880
 of this, would it be bad?

00:55:02.880 --> 00:55:06.440
 And the dentist said to me, look, if you were an 85 year old woman, I'd say it doesn't

00:55:06.440 --> 00:55:07.440
 matter.

00:55:07.440 --> 00:55:11.640
 But for a younger person, you probably want that tooth at some point in your life.

00:55:11.640 --> 00:55:15.880
 So if you do feel like the end is nigh, it's probably not worth getting it done.

00:55:15.880 --> 00:55:16.880
 Yeah.

00:55:16.880 --> 00:55:17.880
 So that's something to reassure you.

00:55:17.880 --> 00:55:18.880
 You're saying I should leave it?

00:55:18.880 --> 00:55:19.880
 Leave it.

00:55:19.880 --> 00:55:25.120
 I mean, Anna, that's like, I remember when I was younger, being in a cab and not having

00:55:25.120 --> 00:55:28.360
 much money and saying, and just, you know, you say to the cabbie, can you let me off

00:55:28.360 --> 00:55:29.360
 here?

00:55:29.360 --> 00:55:30.360
 This is great.

00:55:30.360 --> 00:55:31.360
 You're a mile short of your destination.

00:55:31.360 --> 00:55:32.360
 Yeah.

00:55:32.360 --> 00:55:33.360
 It takes up the cash you got.

00:55:33.360 --> 00:55:34.360
 That's what I've done.

00:55:34.360 --> 00:55:37.840
 I've done an infected wisdom tooth at the moment, while I've taken antibiotics, it's

00:55:37.840 --> 00:55:39.040
 just about getting better.

00:55:39.040 --> 00:55:42.360
 But I'm thinking the way that Andy's looking at all three of us at the moment, I think

00:55:42.360 --> 00:55:47.360
 our make-out sessions might not be happening anymore.

00:55:47.360 --> 00:55:51.800
 Okay, that's it.

00:55:51.800 --> 00:55:52.800
 That's all of our facts.

00:55:52.800 --> 00:55:53.800
 Thank you so much for listening.
