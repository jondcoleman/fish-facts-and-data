00:00:00,00:00:04,"Hi everyone, welcome to this week's episode of No Such Things as a Fish."
00:00:04,00:00:09,"I have three things to share with you very, very quickly before we start this week's"
00:00:09,00:00:15,show and I will give them to you in reverse order of how much you embrace capitalism.
00:00:15,00:00:22,"So first of all, if you go to nosuchthingsafish.com you will find that we have merch."
00:00:22,00:00:25,We have a whole new range of merchandise.
00:00:25,00:00:29,"There is a tour book, which was originally only available on tour, it's got loads of"
00:00:29,00:00:33,stuff about the history of fish made lovingly by Alex Bell.
00:00:33,00:00:38,There are pretty much the nerdiest t-shirts you've ever seen and there are pin badges.
00:00:38,00:00:39,They can be bought separately.
00:00:39,00:00:43,They can be bought in a big old bundle and they are the perfect Christmas present for
00:00:43,00:00:49,the fish listener in your life or maybe just a Christmas present to yourself.
00:00:49,00:00:52,"Second up, well just a quick reminder about Club Fish."
00:00:52,00:00:58,"That is the secret members area of fish where you can get ad free episodes, you can get"
00:00:58,00:01:03,loads of bonus content such as compilations and quizzes and the mail bag.
00:01:03,00:01:07,"You can join our discord, there's all sorts of stuff up there and the way you get to that"
00:01:07,00:01:10,is again to go to nosuchthingasafish.com.
00:01:10,00:01:17,"Finally, if you go to nosuchthingasafish.com/ukrain then you'll get to a very special thing."
00:01:17,00:01:22,We have teamed up with some of our friends in Kyiv and they have made a quiz which is
00:01:22,00:01:24,based on facts from nosuchthingasafish.
00:01:24,00:01:30,"It's on an app called The Game, it's a really cool app, it's like a quiz based on this kind"
00:01:30,00:01:31,of slavic style of quizzing.
00:01:31,00:01:35,The questions are really really fun and that is completely free.
00:01:35,00:01:40,All that we ask is that at the end of it you at least consider giving some money to U24
00:01:40,00:01:45,which is the main place for charitable donations in support of Ukraine to help rebuild the
00:01:45,00:01:46,country.
00:01:46,00:01:51,"Okay, well that's it, three different things, buy some merch, join clubfish, do the quiz"
00:01:51,00:01:54,and help Ukraine if you can if you have any spare money.
00:01:54,00:01:58,And if you want to do none of those things then worry not because the podcast which will
00:01:58,00:02:05,always be free is coming up right after I say those magic words on with the podcast.
00:02:05,00:02:26,"Hello and welcome to another episode of No Such Thing As A Fish, a weekly podcast coming"
00:02:26,00:02:29,to you from the QI offices in Covern Garden.
00:02:29,00:02:34,"My name is Dan Schreiber, I am sitting here with Andrew Hunter Murray, James Harkin and"
00:02:34,00:02:38,Anna Tyshinsky and once again we have gathered around the microphones with our four favorite
00:02:38,00:02:43,"facts from the last seven days and in a particular order, here we go."
00:02:43,00:02:46,Starting with fact number one and that is my fact.
00:02:46,00:02:53,My fact this week is that the 1986 ocean search to recover debris from the Challenger disaster
00:02:53,00:02:59,"also turned up 25 kilograms of cocaine, the value of which was enough to cover the $13"
00:02:59,00:03:02,million cost of the entire search operation.
00:03:02,00:03:04,"Wow, what a shame."
00:03:04,00:03:06,It's which bit?
00:03:06,00:03:10,"Well no, the fact that they could have gotten that money and it would have paid for the"
00:03:10,00:03:12,whole thing but obviously you can't just go and sell your cocaine.
00:03:12,00:03:13,Which is weird isn't it?
00:03:13,00:03:15,You should be able to sell your cocaine.
00:03:15,00:03:19,There should be like a government buyback program but for cocaine.
00:03:19,00:03:20,Exactly.
00:03:20,00:03:21,Because in the end they just burnt it right?
00:03:21,00:03:26,So you could argue that this whole thing cost about $26 billion.
00:03:26,00:03:29,So what this was is obviously the very tragic Challenger disaster.
00:03:29,00:03:35,"NASA sent a spaceship up in space, 73 seconds into its launch it explodes."
00:03:35,00:03:37,That was January 1986.
00:03:37,00:03:41,They then start the rescue mission to try and salvage any of the bits of the ship that
00:03:41,00:03:42,they could find.
00:03:42,00:03:47,The bit where it exploded over was just over Florida so the ocean patch that it landed
00:03:47,00:03:50,in is a very garbage-y patched bit of ocean.
00:03:50,00:03:54,So to find it was a very hard process because they were using sonar and when you use the
00:03:54,00:03:59,sonar you're picking up on everything literally from garbage all the way through to shipwrecks
00:03:59,00:04:00,and so on.
00:04:00,00:04:04,"So along the way they found the things they trawled up included marine batteries, trash"
00:04:04,00:04:09,"cans, paint cans, there was half a torpedo, a refrigerator."
00:04:09,00:04:11,It was like everything but the kitchen sink wasn't it?
00:04:11,00:04:15,Well it was literally not because they found a kitchen sink as well.
00:04:15,00:04:18,Is this just a clever way of getting someone to clear up the oceans without telling them
00:04:18,00:04:19,they're clearing out the oceans?
00:04:19,00:04:23,Like when you kind of put a pee on a bit of - how do you trick children to eat healthy
00:04:23,00:04:24,food?
00:04:24,00:04:25,You know you put a pee on a bit of chocolate or something.
00:04:25,00:04:26,Yeah.
00:04:26,00:04:27,You put a pee on a bit of chocolate.
00:04:27,00:04:28,That's it.
00:04:28,00:04:38,They did find a lot of cocaine in that area not just the Challenger search rescue mission.
00:04:38,00:04:43,They found five identical duffel bags all of which had cocaine in over about a six-month
00:04:43,00:04:44,period.
00:04:44,00:04:45,Identical duffel bags?
00:04:45,00:04:46,Yeah.
00:04:46,00:04:50,So the NASA people they found the fifth one but there had been four previous duffel bags
00:04:50,00:04:53,all full of cocaine that had been found in the area.
00:04:53,00:04:56,It's quite a good way to hide cocaine I think in a duffel bag because I don't think people
00:04:56,00:04:57,look in a duffel bag.
00:04:57,00:04:58,Do you think?
00:04:58,00:05:02,I've never said duffel bag that's many times in a short space of time but I think of duffel
00:05:02,00:05:06,"bags as being something quite innocuous, something quite as you take to school, you have a duffel"
00:05:06,00:05:07,bag.
00:05:07,00:05:11,Yeah but I think if you watch like certainly British gangster movies like the Guy Ritchie
00:05:11,00:05:14,kind of movies you can imagine them opening up a duffel bag.
00:05:14,00:05:15,It's always in a duffel bag.
00:05:15,00:05:17,I feel like that's your classic cocaine character.
00:05:17,00:05:18,What's a duffel?
00:05:18,00:05:19,What is duffel?
00:05:19,00:05:20,Duffel is a town in Belgium.
00:05:20,00:05:21,Is it?
00:05:21,00:05:22,"Yeah, yeah."
00:05:22,00:05:23,I think it's a shoulder bag.
00:05:23,00:05:24,Yeah.
00:05:24,00:05:25,Oh a shoulder bag.
00:05:25,00:05:26,I associate it with crime.
00:05:26,00:05:27,Definitely.
00:05:27,00:05:29,What are you thinking of?
00:05:29,00:05:32,I think of duffel as a light blue cloth.
00:05:32,00:05:34,"Yeah, that's what I'm thinking as well."
00:05:34,00:05:35,"Oh okay, okay."
00:05:35,00:05:36,Right.
00:05:36,00:05:37,"Well, yeah."
00:05:37,00:05:41,But also I would argue that duffel bag doesn't get an exemption from when you walk in to
00:05:41,00:05:44,say a building and they have security checks not to be opened.
00:05:44,00:05:46,They normally wave you through.
00:05:46,00:05:49,"Excuse me sir, is that a duffel bag?"
00:05:49,00:05:53,"But from the Belgian town, yeah, come on through, yeah that's fine."
00:05:53,00:05:58,"These five identical duffel bags full of cocaine, four of them, they managed to get the cocaine"
00:05:58,00:06:01,and they managed to destroy it.
00:06:01,00:06:04,Can you guess what happened to the fifth amount of cocaine?
00:06:04,00:06:08,So there's another duffel bag full of cocaine which they never destroyed.
00:06:08,00:06:09,Went into a museum?
00:06:09,00:06:12,"The cocaine museum, yeah."
00:06:12,00:06:15,Very good glass cases on those exhibits.
00:06:15,00:06:16,The audio guide.
00:06:16,00:06:17,Yes you're going through the cocaine museum now.
00:06:17,00:06:23,"Yes, if you look on your left hand side this is a really good exhibit."
00:06:23,00:06:28,"It went missing, it was put into a sixth duffel bag and smuggled out that way."
00:06:28,00:06:34,No it was found by a party boat just off the coast of Florida and they found this massive
00:06:34,00:06:38,bag of cocaine and thought they're not going to believe us if we take this back so they
00:06:38,00:06:46,"emptied all of the cocaine back into the sea and they took it off, 25 kilos as a party."
00:06:46,00:06:49,"And what happened to the duffel bags, do we know?"
00:06:49,00:06:53,Well I don't know.
00:06:53,00:06:55,"Often what would happen is they would sell them on, wouldn't they?"
00:06:55,00:07:00,"The police or the Coast Guard would, if they find stuff and it's not illegal, they have"
00:07:00,00:07:05,"like auctions and stuff so there might have been, if you'd have seen a lot of four identical"
00:07:05,00:07:06,duffel bags.
00:07:06,00:07:10,"Do you think, and if you got your head right in one and really sniffed away at the lining,"
00:07:10,00:07:11,you could definitely get a hit I'd imagine.
00:07:11,00:07:12,Definitely.
00:07:12,00:07:13,Do you think?
00:07:13,00:07:15,"It's not up, isn't it cocaine?"
00:07:15,00:07:16,I'm not an expert on drugs.
00:07:16,00:07:18,I don't think you put it in the bag loose.
00:07:18,00:07:19,"No, that's fair."
00:07:19,00:07:20,That is fair.
00:07:20,00:07:27,"Can I just quickly ask about the duffel bags, do we know if it was part of a shipwrecked"
00:07:27,00:07:28,or what?
00:07:28,00:07:32,"We don't know where they came from these duffel bags, presumably some kind of nefarious"
00:07:32,00:07:33,activity.
00:07:33,00:07:34,Yeah.
00:07:34,00:07:36,"But we're not, no they were, that's kind of the mystery is where they came from."
00:07:36,00:07:37,Right.
00:07:37,00:07:38,What a great ad for duffel bags though.
00:07:38,00:07:39,They're so resilient.
00:07:39,00:07:40,It's podcast.
00:07:40,00:07:41,"Yeah, it is."
00:07:41,00:07:43,I think you can just find them floating in the ocean.
00:07:43,00:07:45,They might have survived the plane crash or a sunken ship.
00:07:45,00:07:49,"Well, we don't know what kind of state the cocaine was in, it might have been unsnortable."
00:07:49,00:07:50,It could have been drenched.
00:07:50,00:07:53,You know when you eat some crab meat sometimes and there's a tiny little bit of crab shell
00:07:53,00:07:55,"in, do you reckon it's the same with snorting cocaine?"
00:07:55,00:07:57,"You're like, oh, there's a bit of shell in this."
00:07:57,00:07:58,"Yeah, yeah."
00:07:58,00:07:59,"I think it is, yeah."
00:07:59,00:08:00,Duffel bags.
00:08:00,00:08:05,I was looking up pharmaceutical things found on shipwrecks and I think I found maybe the
00:08:05,00:08:10,"oldest example of this being found, so this was discovered in 1990, not from 1990."
00:08:10,00:08:17,These archaeologists found an ancient Greek shipwreck and there were pills on board that
00:08:17,00:08:18,they were able to retrieve.
00:08:18,00:08:19,Can you imagine that?
00:08:19,00:08:20,Wow.
00:08:20,00:08:21,I know.
00:08:21,00:08:24,"They were in a duffel bag that had been, obviously they weren't."
00:08:24,00:08:28,But then the scientists were able to analyse them and we know what people were taking as
00:08:28,00:08:31,medicine because we literally have surviving medicine from ancient Greece.
00:08:31,00:08:32,So you have what they are?
00:08:32,00:08:33,"Yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:08:33,00:08:37,Lots of different ingredients which were all sort of faintly vegetable or herbal.
00:08:37,00:08:42,"So celery, carrot, radish, wild onion, oak, cabbage and a few other things."
00:08:42,00:08:47,"And they were kind of, I think we've been able to tie them to recipes or medical manuals"
00:08:47,00:08:49,"from the time that said, oh, this is good for lots of things."
00:08:49,00:08:51,"And these are kind of cure-all pills, basically."
00:08:51,00:08:52,Lots of different ailments.
00:08:52,00:08:53,That's incredible.
00:08:53,00:08:54,How's that?
00:08:54,00:08:55,Wow.
00:08:55,00:08:56,"It's basically a vitamin pill, right?"
00:08:56,00:08:57,Pretty much.
00:08:57,00:09:00,You should have given them to Crabtree and Evelyn.
00:09:00,00:09:01,Crabtree and Evelyn.
00:09:01,00:09:07,"Crabtree and Evelyn is that shop that sells, it's quite expensive."
00:09:07,00:09:11,"It's expensive, herbal stuff, which I'm sure is very useful for a lot of people."
00:09:11,00:09:12,Sure.
00:09:12,00:09:14,Do you guys don't know Crabtree and Evelyn?
00:09:14,00:09:16,"I'm afraid it hasn't hit Bolton, I don't think."
00:09:16,00:09:17,"I mean, there are just shops."
00:09:17,00:09:19,"There's one bit, about 10 yards from our office."
00:09:19,00:09:20,Is there?
00:09:20,00:09:21,"Yeah, literally 10 yards from the office."
00:09:21,00:09:22,"Oh, is that not Holland and Barrett?"
00:09:22,00:09:23,Holland and Barrett.
00:09:23,00:09:24,That's what I'm thinking of.
00:09:24,00:09:25,Holland and Barrett.
00:09:25,00:09:26,Crabtree and Evelyn.
00:09:26,00:09:27,Crabtree and Evelyn.
00:09:27,00:09:31,"If you know who Crabtree and Evelyn are, then please write it."
00:09:31,00:09:36,I think maybe Crabtree and Evelyn is another version of Holland and Barrett.
00:09:36,00:09:37,I don't know.
00:09:37,00:09:44,"I feel like it sounds like two elderly detectives from a Richard Osmond novel, doesn't it?"
00:09:44,00:09:48,I really thought you guys looked like the idiots in that.
00:09:48,00:09:49,Wow.
00:09:49,00:09:52,"Yeah, we weak herbal cures."
00:09:52,00:09:58,So lots of shipwrecks that exist at the moment are being stolen.
00:09:58,00:10:02,"There's a thriving market in shipwreck theft, which I had never heard of before reading"
00:10:02,00:10:03,about this.
00:10:03,00:10:08,"So it's Matt, 40 second world warships that were sunk have already been partly or totally"
00:10:08,00:10:12,"just removed from the ocean, and it's because they're incredibly valuable."
00:10:12,00:10:13,Can you guess why?
00:10:13,00:10:14,Yes.
00:10:14,00:10:15,"Okay, great."
00:10:15,00:10:16,Let me tell you why.
00:10:16,00:10:17,I read the article.
00:10:17,00:10:23,"So they contain something which we need today, like Euclia stuff, like uranium."
00:10:23,00:10:24,"Oh, you're so close."
00:10:24,00:10:26,It's they're made of something that we need today.
00:10:26,00:10:31,"So they're made of iPhones, very forward thinking."
00:10:31,00:10:36,"No, they're made of steel, lots of them, but they're made of steel that was cast before"
00:10:36,00:10:37,the year 1945.
00:10:37,00:10:42,"When nuclear testing started, they're made of something called low background steel."
00:10:42,00:10:45,And that's incredibly valuable.
00:10:45,00:10:46,"Scientists use it, don't they?"
00:10:46,00:10:50,"Scientists need loads of it for medical equipment, Geiger counters, space sensors, and all steel"
00:10:50,00:10:53,that you make these days because it uses atmospheric air in the production is slightly
00:10:53,00:10:55,radioactive.
00:10:55,00:11:00,So this stuff is really valuable and also low radiation lead is used.
00:11:00,00:11:04,"And a few years ago, they used a 2000 year old shipwreck."
00:11:04,00:11:07,The Italian Institute of Nuclear Physics used it.
00:11:07,00:11:09,They cut it up to make a neutrino detector.
00:11:09,00:11:13,"And there's a bit of a hoohar about it at the time because, you know, it's sort of controversial"
00:11:13,00:11:17,"and yeah, but it's worth 20 times as much as normal lead, low background lead."
00:11:17,00:11:21,"It's really and but there is one bit of good news, which is that this, you know, the steel"
00:11:21,00:11:23,is all steel today is radioactive.
00:11:23,00:11:27,It's getting less radioactive because we're not doing as many nuclear tests anymore.
00:11:27,00:11:32,"Well, at least there's no danger of nuclear war in the next year or so."
00:11:32,00:11:36,"At the moment, at the time of recording, background radiation is decreasing."
00:11:36,00:11:42,"No, I've just thought, if you are a supervillain who just got a load of this iron, it's in"
00:11:42,00:11:45,"your best interest to kind of start another nuclear war, isn't it?"
00:11:45,00:11:48,Because you want the value to increase.
00:11:48,00:11:49,Yeah.
00:11:49,00:11:50,That's terrible.
00:11:50,00:11:51,That's a James Bond plot.
00:11:51,00:11:55,It's a classic James Bond very convoluted way of making money as opposed to trading.
00:11:55,00:11:56,I love it.
00:11:56,00:11:58,"But it is, I mean, it's hard getting stuff off ships."
00:11:58,00:12:03,"It's hard getting ships up like the salvage, the technology of salvage is so cool."
00:12:03,00:12:04,They do.
00:12:04,00:12:07,I was reading about when they salvaged the Costa Concordia member that sunk in the med
00:12:07,00:12:14,in 2012 and they have armbands basically to get them back up to the surface.
00:12:14,00:12:17,It's too late for armbands.
00:12:17,00:12:22,"It's kind of made of steel, probably stolen from some other sunk in ship."
00:12:22,00:12:27,They're called Sponsons and they are these projections that they attach to the side of
00:12:27,00:12:28,the ship.
00:12:28,00:12:30,So you've got a ship on the floor of the ocean.
00:12:30,00:12:31,It's on its side.
00:12:31,00:12:36,"First of all, you'll fill one Sponson with water and the other with air and so that will"
00:12:36,00:12:40,tip the ship upright as the air one lifts in the water.
00:12:40,00:12:44,But the water one is weighed down and then you'll get rid of the water that's in the
00:12:44,00:12:45,heavier one.
00:12:45,00:12:49,So they've both got air in them and then that just floats it up to the surface like
00:12:49,00:12:50,a pair of armbands.
00:12:50,00:12:51,Pretty cool.
00:12:51,00:12:58,It is quite cool and I think they did that to Costa Concordia I think and like USSR.
00:12:58,00:13:01,"Why did they do it to Costa, why didn't they just leave it?"
00:13:01,00:13:02,"Yeah, good question."
00:13:02,00:13:05,"Like these things with the really expensive iron, I see why you would do that or if you"
00:13:05,00:13:07,had a galley with loads of gold coins.
00:13:07,00:13:08,Yeah.
00:13:08,00:13:11,"It feels like Costa Concordia would just have, you know, like a pool table."
00:13:11,00:13:15,"I think it was on its, wasn't it poking out of the water?"
00:13:15,00:13:16,Yeah.
00:13:16,00:13:17,It wasn't quite fully in.
00:13:17,00:13:18,I think it wasn't fully submerged.
00:13:18,00:13:24,"I think it probably blocking other traffic and also useful for scrapers, I guess."
00:13:24,00:13:29,"But I think in those cases where you had court cases and so on, I think it's part of the"
00:13:29,00:13:33,"working out the insurance and all that sort of stuff, isn't it?"
00:13:33,00:13:34,Did it definitely hit in the way it did?
00:13:34,00:13:37,Let's look and see whether you have to look into that kind of stuff.
00:13:37,00:13:39,"I suppose that's what they were doing with Challenger, wasn't it?"
00:13:39,00:13:40,A lot of it.
00:13:40,00:13:41,Yeah.
00:13:41,00:13:44,It was like an investigation as much as trying to salvage anything.
00:13:44,00:13:45,Yeah.
00:13:45,00:13:46,Mentioning Challenger again very quickly.
00:13:46,00:13:47,Big Bird was meant to be on Challenger.
00:13:47,00:13:48,Oh yeah.
00:13:48,00:13:51,"The last minute thing that, well, it wasn't super last minute."
00:13:51,00:13:52,It was...
00:13:52,00:13:53,Quit still.
00:13:53,00:13:54,Pause.
00:13:54,00:13:56,"Three, two, wait."
00:13:56,00:13:57,Yeah.
00:13:57,00:14:03,"Three, ah, ah, ah, ah, two, ah, ah, ah, ah."
00:14:03,00:14:08,"Yeah, the actor was asked to go in and be part of the mission."
00:14:08,00:14:09,Gosh.
00:14:09,00:14:13,"I think his name was Carol Spinney and he, and it was all going to go ahead, but then"
00:14:13,00:14:16,they realized that the Big Bird costume was way too big to get in there.
00:14:16,00:14:20,"And there's a very sad account, actually, of them at Sesame Street watching the Challenger"
00:14:20,00:14:22,"go up and Carol Spinney going, ""Oh, I was meant to be on that."""
00:14:22,00:14:24,And then the explosion and the sort of the realization.
00:14:24,00:14:25,Wow.
00:14:25,00:14:26,Yeah.
00:14:26,00:14:27,"Really, really horrible."
00:14:27,00:14:28,Yeah.
00:14:28,00:14:33,Something else that washes up that we've never mentioned on this show is feet.
00:14:33,00:14:34,Human feet.
00:14:34,00:14:35,And human feet.
00:14:35,00:14:36,Okay.
00:14:36,00:14:38,"Yeah, I was just looking at weird stuff found in the ocean."
00:14:38,00:14:39,Oh yeah.
00:14:39,00:14:40,And I found out why.
00:14:40,00:14:42,So do you remember this mystery it started about?
00:14:42,00:14:45,Do we know why?
00:14:45,00:14:46,We can speculate reliably.
00:14:46,00:14:50,"So they kept finding like, was it like just left feet or something?"
00:14:50,00:14:51,"No, it wasn't."
00:14:51,00:14:53,"I think it was, it was basically feet overall."
00:14:53,00:14:54,Okay.
00:14:54,00:14:55,There was a while when a few left ones I found.
00:14:55,00:14:56,"There was shod feet, weren't they?"
00:14:56,00:14:57,Yeah.
00:14:57,00:14:58,There was shod feet.
00:14:58,00:14:59,Yes.
00:14:59,00:15:00,Wearing a shoe.
00:15:00,00:15:06,"Usually used to refer to horses, but in Andy's case, apparently, to refer to the people."
00:15:06,00:15:07,Where was this?
00:15:07,00:15:08,Was this globally?
00:15:08,00:15:09,They were rocking up on shorelines?
00:15:09,00:15:10,No.
00:15:10,00:15:11,This was the old thing.
00:15:11,00:15:14,"It was specifically in Canada, or Vancouver Island, in a place called the Salish Sea."
00:15:14,00:15:19,"So it's just like near the border with the U.S. And from 2007, over the course of 12"
00:15:19,00:15:24,"years, 15 different feet within shoes washed up."
00:15:24,00:15:28,"And the shoes were all sneakers, except one shoe, which was a walking boot."
00:15:28,00:15:31,"That sounds irrelevant, but it's not."
00:15:31,00:15:32,Oh.
00:15:32,00:15:35,"And everyone was, there were lots of theories, obviously, about who had been assassinated"
00:15:35,00:15:37,and had their feet chopped off.
00:15:37,00:15:43,"So this woman, Gail Anderson, who studies things like this, how things decompose, sank"
00:15:43,00:15:48,a bunch of dead pigs into the Salish Sea to see how they decompose.
00:15:48,00:15:49,Were they shod?
00:15:49,00:15:50,Yeah.
00:15:50,00:15:54,"They actually were not shod because that was something, because you can't fit a sneaker"
00:15:54,00:16:00,"on a pig, I think, as the old saying goes."
00:16:00,00:16:04,"They've got trotters, though, which have a different, I imagine, float profile."
00:16:04,00:16:05,Yeah.
00:16:05,00:16:06,I think they do.
00:16:06,00:16:10,"So in an ideal world, she would have sunk a human body, but there are issues around"
00:16:10,00:16:11,that.
00:16:11,00:16:14,So I would definitely give my consent for a weird experiment like that.
00:16:14,00:16:15,"I know me, too."
00:16:15,00:16:16,If there was a use for an...
00:16:16,00:16:17,"I would say, orally, you just have."
00:16:17,00:16:18,"Oh, yeah."
00:16:18,00:16:19,Yeah.
00:16:19,00:16:21,If there's any mad scientist listening.
00:16:21,00:16:23,Whoever gets me first gets me for...
00:16:23,00:16:25,Is that legally possible?
00:16:25,00:16:26,I'm sure.
00:16:26,00:16:27,Wow.
00:16:27,00:16:28,Okay.
00:16:28,00:16:29,Great.
00:16:29,00:16:31,"There should definitely be a thing you can check, donate my body to weird science."
00:16:31,00:16:34,"You can donate your body to science, but I need it to be..."
00:16:34,00:16:35,"Specifically, yeah."
00:16:35,00:16:36,Something.
00:16:36,00:16:37,Yeah.
00:16:37,00:16:39,"Specifically, no such thing as a fish-worthy science."
00:16:39,00:16:40,Anyway.
00:16:40,00:16:41,"Oh, yeah, trotters."
00:16:41,00:16:44,"Basically, the conclusion was that they get eaten by crustaceans pretty quickly, but"
00:16:44,00:16:49,"in your ankles, you've got basically soft tissue like tendons, joints, ligaments, stuff"
00:16:49,00:16:50,like that.
00:16:50,00:16:51,So they can eat through all of that.
00:16:51,00:16:56,"And because there's a trend in this area over the last 20 years for trainers, which have"
00:16:56,00:16:57,air bubbles in them.
00:16:57,00:16:58,Like nike-airs and stuff.
00:16:58,00:16:59,Nike-airs.
00:16:59,00:17:03,They pop up to the surface and bob along to a beach.
00:17:03,00:17:04,But the feet are remaining.
00:17:04,00:17:05,The feet haven't been eaten.
00:17:05,00:17:06,"No, because that's what..."
00:17:06,00:17:08,I think they're probably skeleton feet inside the show at this point.
00:17:08,00:17:09,"I suppose, yeah."
00:17:09,00:17:13,"You kind of eat the ankle and then you kind of turn around to start eating the foot, but"
00:17:13,00:17:15,it's already floating away kind of thing.
00:17:15,00:17:19,It's kind of amazing that crabs and lobsters also find it hard to get to the difficult
00:17:19,00:17:20,bits of humans.
00:17:20,00:17:21,Yeah.
00:17:21,00:17:24,They should have a special human fork.
00:17:24,00:17:25,"Yeah, exactly."
00:17:25,00:17:26,Wow.
00:17:26,00:17:27,It's really crazy.
00:17:27,00:17:28,"Oh, I'm not ordering the human."
00:17:28,00:17:29,No.
00:17:29,00:17:30,"I can't, no."
00:17:30,00:17:31,I've just got a new shirt.
00:17:31,00:17:32,Okay.
00:17:32,00:17:41,It is time for fact number two and that is Anna.
00:17:41,00:17:45,"My fact this week is that chimps will help to break you out of prison, but only if they"
00:17:45,00:17:48,like you.
00:17:48,00:17:51,So is it a good idea to befriend some chimps?
00:17:51,00:17:52,Before the bank job.
00:17:52,00:17:53,Before the bank job.
00:17:53,00:17:54,Go straight from the sanctuary to...
00:17:54,00:17:55,Yeah.
00:17:55,00:18:00,"I would say it depends if the prison you're aimed for is staffed by chimps, which very"
00:18:00,00:18:01,few are.
00:18:01,00:18:02,Yeah.
00:18:02,00:18:03,Yeah.
00:18:03,00:18:06,"So I don't know how many practical benefits this is going to have for you, but this..."
00:18:06,00:18:11,"I think I originally read this a while ago in a book called Mental Leaps by Keith Holyoke,"
00:18:11,00:18:14,"which is really good, but it's about this specific chimp called Sarah on whom lots of"
00:18:14,00:18:17,experiments were done in the 80s.
00:18:17,00:18:22,We might have mentioned her before and they were done by David and Anna Premack and they
00:18:22,00:18:26,were trying to suss out basically the extent to which chimps have empathy and a theory
00:18:26,00:18:31,of mind so they can understand that other beings are conscious beings just like them.
00:18:31,00:18:37,And so they did this amazing experiment where they showed her videos of actors trapped in
00:18:37,00:18:42,"a cage and then they showed her pictures, like various grainy black and white pictures"
00:18:42,00:18:43,of various objects.
00:18:43,00:18:47,"So it would be like a key that could let her out of the cage, let the actor out of the"
00:18:47,00:18:52,cage and then a book and then a crowbar and then a poo or whatever.
00:18:52,00:18:56,"And I think you've made a mistake in describing this that you've included crowbar, which also"
00:18:56,00:18:57,can be used to get you out of prison.
00:18:57,00:19:00,It should have been the key and then a lot of things that you can't use.
00:19:00,00:19:05,"And in fact, a book can help you on your journey out of prison through education."
00:19:05,00:19:06,Yeah.
00:19:06,00:19:07,Right.
00:19:07,00:19:08,"That is a more long form, isn't it?"
00:19:08,00:19:09,You're absolutely right.
00:19:09,00:19:13,I've picked the one other object that would have confused the hell out of poor Sarah and
00:19:13,00:19:14,Chimp.
00:19:14,00:19:15,I got confused though.
00:19:15,00:19:16,"Yeah, yeah."
00:19:16,00:19:17,I'm so sorry.
00:19:17,00:19:18,Flingy poo at the guard.
00:19:18,00:19:19,He's distracted.
00:19:19,00:19:20,You're over the wall.
00:19:20,00:19:21,"Hey, you should be reading your book."
00:19:21,00:19:22,Right.
00:19:22,00:19:25,I'm just going to say they gave her a key.
00:19:25,00:19:28,They showed her a picture of a key and then brought three other things that can't get
00:19:28,00:19:29,you out of prison.
00:19:29,00:19:30,Yeah.
00:19:30,00:19:32,They showed her how to pick the picture of the key.
00:19:32,00:19:36,"So that was like, she knows that this actor wants to get out of prison and she's managed"
00:19:36,00:19:40,"to match up this image, grainy image, and figure out that that's what the actor would"
00:19:40,00:19:41,want.
00:19:41,00:19:42,Right.
00:19:42,00:19:43,And then there were lots of other stuff as well.
00:19:43,00:19:45,So they'd show actors trying to reach a banana that's just out of reach beyond the
00:19:45,00:19:50,cage or trying to reach up to a banana that was on the ceiling and couldn't get to it.
00:19:50,00:19:58,"And they'd show her pictures of a ladder, a box, a jet pack, not a ladder, not a ladder."
00:19:58,00:20:01,And then three other things that you can't do.
00:20:01,00:20:02,Exactly.
00:20:02,00:20:04,A ladder and then a pole to get a banana.
00:20:04,00:20:07,Do they then give her the choice to help people?
00:20:07,00:20:08,Yes.
00:20:08,00:20:09,Okay.
00:20:09,00:20:13,"So, well, then they did the experiment with two different people, Keith, her favorite"
00:20:13,00:20:14,trainer.
00:20:14,00:20:18,"And in the study, it says, Bill, Brackett's fictitious name because I guess didn't want"
00:20:18,00:20:19,to be identified.
00:20:19,00:20:20,Oh.
00:20:20,00:20:22,Someone who she didn't like.
00:20:22,00:20:26,And she would choose the good versions for Keith so she'd get him the banana by giving
00:20:26,00:20:32,"him the pole or let him out of prison, but for Bill, she chose bad outcomes for him."
00:20:32,00:20:36,"So there'd be pictures of, for instance, Bill, like, sprawled out, having tripped over"
00:20:36,00:20:38,the box isn't on the floor.
00:20:38,00:20:40,And she'd pick that one for him because he wasn't a fan.
00:20:40,00:20:41,What's Bill worried about?
00:20:41,00:20:42,How interesting.
00:20:42,00:20:43,What does he want?
00:20:43,00:20:45,No one to know his name?
00:20:45,00:20:46,I guess.
00:20:46,00:20:47,Because chimps don't like it.
00:20:47,00:20:48,It's embarrassing.
00:20:48,00:20:49,"If a chimp doesn't like him, what's he done to the chimp?"
00:20:49,00:20:50,Yeah.
00:20:50,00:20:51,"Oh, I see."
00:20:51,00:20:52,"Oh, there's an implication there."
00:20:52,00:20:53,Yeah.
00:20:53,00:20:54,I don't think we're...
00:20:54,00:20:56,"I guess he just doesn't like, what, his music taste?"
00:20:56,00:20:59,I think Bill's doing some dark stuff.
00:20:59,00:21:00,Okay.
00:21:00,00:21:04,There's no suggestion in the study that Bill did anything untoward.
00:21:04,00:21:07,"We should actually, if you're going to say stuff like that, then we should change his"
00:21:07,00:21:09,name again so that people don't know.
00:21:09,00:21:10,"Oh, yeah."
00:21:10,00:21:11,"Yeah, Mark."
00:21:11,00:21:14,"And actually, I might change my name just so that they don't know it was me, so I'll"
00:21:14,00:21:15,be Gary.
00:21:15,00:21:16,Wow.
00:21:16,00:21:20,"Anyway, it's just so incredible the mental leaps that they can make, understanding."
00:21:20,00:21:21,This is a person.
00:21:21,00:21:22,It's a person I like.
00:21:22,00:21:23,I want to help them.
00:21:23,00:21:24,I don't want to say it.
00:21:24,00:21:25,I think they're smart.
00:21:25,00:21:27,I think chimpanzees are pretty clever.
00:21:27,00:21:28,Chimps.
00:21:28,00:21:29,Yeah.
00:21:29,00:21:30,It depends what you compare them to.
00:21:30,00:21:31,That's true.
00:21:31,00:21:32,Yeah.
00:21:32,00:21:33,"If you compare them to Slavoj Zizek, they're not very smart."
00:21:33,00:21:34,But if you compare them to me...
00:21:34,00:21:37,If you compare them to Gary over here...
00:21:37,00:21:43,But the one thing they do is they will...
00:21:43,00:21:46,"This is kind of, again, their friendship to enemy ratio."
00:21:46,00:21:48,They have enemy lists.
00:21:48,00:21:49,Do they?
00:21:49,00:21:50,Yeah.
00:21:50,00:21:51,Wow.
00:21:51,00:21:52,"And the article I read said, ""This is why chimpanzees are like Richard Nixon, which I think is"
00:21:52,00:21:53,"a bit unfair."""
00:21:53,00:21:57,So this is a scientist from the Max Planck Institute.
00:21:57,00:22:00,"They observed wild chimpanzees for thousands of hours in a row, right?"
00:22:00,00:22:01,Yeah.
00:22:01,00:22:03,And what do chimpanzees spend lots of their time doing?
00:22:03,00:22:04,Grooming each other.
00:22:04,00:22:05,Grooming.
00:22:05,00:22:06,Yeah.
00:22:06,00:22:07,And it's a big thing.
00:22:07,00:22:09,And it's a huge part of their social life as well.
00:22:09,00:22:14,"And basically, they have a very, very sophisticated mental map of who has groomed them recently,"
00:22:14,00:22:15,who they've groomed.
00:22:15,00:22:18,"And it's effectively who owes them a pint, you know, is that kind of social level."
00:22:18,00:22:21,So they will be able to return the favor for someone who's groomed them.
00:22:21,00:22:25,And they will freeze out other chimpanzees who haven't groomed them or who are selfish
00:22:25,00:22:27,and never groom anyone else.
00:22:27,00:22:34,And then do they break into their offices at the middle of the night and steal documents?
00:22:34,00:22:41,"So for example, if Dan groomed James on Monday, then on Thursday, James might groom Dan back."
00:22:41,00:22:42,And the system works just fine.
00:22:42,00:22:45,"As in, it doesn't need to be the same day for it to be, you know, that's for like..."
00:22:45,00:22:47,"I've slept three times, but I still remember it."
00:22:47,00:22:48,Exactly.
00:22:48,00:22:53,"And like, Dan knows not to worry about it because he knows that you've got his back,"
00:22:53,00:22:54,basically.
00:22:54,00:22:58,"But, you know, if Dan grooms Anna on a Tuesday and there's nothing for the rest of the week"
00:22:58,00:23:02,"and the week after that, Dan will remember and is not to be trusted with this thing."
00:23:02,00:23:03,"And, you know..."
00:23:03,00:23:04,I just like...
00:23:04,00:23:05,He's a hairy man.
00:23:05,00:23:06,"Yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:23:06,00:23:07,It doesn't feel...
00:23:07,00:23:08,It's a normal work.
00:23:08,00:23:09,"Yeah, yeah."
00:23:09,00:23:10,You're right.
00:23:10,00:23:11,We've got a lot on.
00:23:11,00:23:17,All gym research is so interesting and I was listening to actually show what the interview
00:23:17,00:23:21,"Jane Goodall recently and it's so interesting listening to her, obviously it's maybe the"
00:23:21,00:23:27,"most famous chimp researcher ever, but when she started researching, she went to Tanzania,"
00:23:27,00:23:31,"she was the first person who saw chimps using tools, I think, using sticks to catch insects."
00:23:31,00:23:37,"She got PhD at Cambridge based on that, but she got there and she was vilified and all"
00:23:37,00:23:40,"the other academics said, ""You're doing this completely wrong,"" because she wanted to look"
00:23:40,00:23:45,"at chimp's personality and emotion and at the time, everyone else said, ""That's really"
00:23:45,00:23:49,"unscientific, it doesn't make any sense, you're humanising these chimps, they're just animals."""
00:23:49,00:23:53,"Whereas she obviously was saying, ""I've lived with these chimps, they're really similar"
00:23:53,00:23:58,"to us, the only way to understand them is by trying to look at them through these lenses."""
00:23:58,00:23:59,Wow.
00:23:59,00:24:00,"So, yeah, she was..."
00:24:00,00:24:01,She was bitched about.
00:24:01,00:24:04,"So, she would give them names and the scientists would like, ""You can't give them names, that"
00:24:04,00:24:05,"is wild."""
00:24:05,00:24:11,"Well, she was part of a group of three women who were put together by Louis Leakey, who"
00:24:11,00:24:14,was a paleoanthropologist and amazing character in this world.
00:24:14,00:24:18,And he was the one who thought that they needed studying at different closer contact and so
00:24:18,00:24:24,he wanted three women who he thought weren't necessarily even qualified for doing the job
00:24:24,00:24:27,and he wanted them to be single and he wanted to send them out there.
00:24:27,00:24:32,"And so, he found Jane Goodall, he found Diane Fosse, and then there was a third one, unfortunately,"
00:24:32,00:24:35,"whose name I can't remember, and they were known as the Trimates or Leakey's Angels and"
00:24:35,00:24:36,they would go out there.
00:24:36,00:24:37,Leakey's Angels?
00:24:37,00:24:38,Yeah.
00:24:38,00:24:39,Why did they have to be single?
00:24:39,00:24:40,Is that in case they fell in love with the chimps?
00:24:40,00:24:43,I think he was a bit of a eccentric character.
00:24:43,00:24:47,"So, no, he was very much married, but he just had these eccentric ways."
00:24:47,00:24:50,"He sent her a letter saying, ""You've got to have your appendix taken out before you"
00:24:50,00:24:51,"go out there."""
00:24:51,00:24:54,"She did it and then he wrote back saying, ""Oh, I was joking about that."""
00:24:54,00:24:58,"Oh, my God, that is a good prank."
00:24:58,00:25:01,He wanted to test who had the commitment to go out there was the joke of it and then
00:25:01,00:25:03,"he said, ""Oh, you actually did it?"""
00:25:03,00:25:04,"No, no, it was a joke."
00:25:04,00:25:05,He was just a jokey thing.
00:25:05,00:25:09,"But if he was testing the commitment, it sounds like, you know, if he hadn't done it, he might"
00:25:09,00:25:10,"have been like, ""You didn't pass the test."""
00:25:10,00:25:14,"My theory is he was back working on that to be like, ""Oh, yeah, no, I was testing your"
00:25:14,00:25:15,"commitment."""
00:25:15,00:25:21,"Jane Goodall, by the way, I have a Barbie of Jane Goodall, which is like my equivalent"
00:25:21,00:25:23,of Dan buying Ben Elton stuff.
00:25:23,00:25:25,What does it come with?
00:25:25,00:25:29,"It comes with a little monkey, a little chimp, which is the David Greybeard chimp, which"
00:25:29,00:25:33,is the one who she first saw using a stick as a tool.
00:25:33,00:25:36,"You know, she properly believes a Bigfoot, like properly."
00:25:36,00:25:37,And I saw her recently.
00:25:37,00:25:41,Did you get this stuff out of these otherwise sane people?
00:25:41,00:25:42,It's bizarre.
00:25:42,00:25:46,"There's this American program, which is called something like Bigfoot Uncovered or something."
00:25:46,00:25:50,"It looks really kind of amateur, and yet Jane Goodall sat down for a major interview with"
00:25:50,00:25:56,them and told all her anecdotal evidence that she believes that locals believe that it and
00:25:56,00:25:57,so on.
00:25:57,00:26:02,"Did you not write a letter afterwards saying I was only joking about that, by the way?"
00:26:02,00:26:04,I would just get a scar.
00:26:04,00:26:07,I would just get an appendectomy scar if someone asked me to do that.
00:26:07,00:26:08,Smart.
00:26:08,00:26:11,"In most places where you're asked to have it removed, you probably do will have need"
00:26:11,00:26:12,to have had it removed.
00:26:12,00:26:16,"Yeah, most people aren't doing it for jokes, are they?"
00:26:16,00:26:17,No.
00:26:17,00:26:21,How funny that little novelty scar is going to be when you're out in that isolated area.
00:26:21,00:26:25,No doctors are there.
00:26:25,00:26:27,"Chimpanzees, they have their own theme tunes."
00:26:27,00:26:29,I really like this.
00:26:29,00:26:30,Really?
00:26:30,00:26:31,Yeah.
00:26:31,00:26:32,Just like Richard Nixon did.
00:26:32,00:26:36,"They have, this is bizarre, they have these drum rhythms, male chimpanzees."
00:26:36,00:26:40,"When they're traveling, they will bash really loudly."
00:26:40,00:26:45,They grab a big old tree root and they bash it against the surface of a tree and the specific
00:26:45,00:26:50,male chimpanzees have their own specific tunes or rhythms that they bash out and it's to
00:26:50,00:26:54,advertise their presence basically.
00:26:54,00:26:59,There's a primatologist called Catherine Hobaita who found this out and basically they can
00:26:59,00:27:01,decide whether they want to hang out with each other or not.
00:27:01,00:27:03,It's a bit social media-ish.
00:27:03,00:27:04,"They're saying, I'm here."
00:27:04,00:27:05,I don't want to hang out.
00:27:05,00:27:06,I'm here.
00:27:06,00:27:10,"Sounds more sophisticated than social media, to be honest."
00:27:10,00:27:16,But they also can be on incognito mode if they like and it's just not hitting the tree
00:27:16,00:27:17,with the thing.
00:27:17,00:27:20,"Or you can steal someone's identity, couldn't you?"
00:27:20,00:27:25,"You know, get your own blue tick now by imitating their own blue stick."
00:27:25,00:27:34,Can I tell you guys about my favorite prison break of all time with the facts about breaking
00:27:34,00:27:35,human's out of prison?
00:27:35,00:27:39,This is a prisoner in South Korea who broke themselves out.
00:27:39,00:27:42,His name was Choi Gatbok and this was in 2012.
00:27:42,00:27:48,He was in jail for five days off the back of his arrest and he escaped by squeezing his
00:27:48,00:27:51,entire body through the food slot.
00:27:51,00:27:55,That is amazing.
00:27:55,00:27:59,"So when you're in prison, you see this on prison dramas, right?"
00:27:59,00:28:03,"They come in with a tray with your food in, they open a little slot, they slide it under."
00:28:03,00:28:06,It's about the size of a letter box.
00:28:06,00:28:07,It's so tiny.
00:28:07,00:28:15,"So the slot was 5.9 inches tall, 17.5 inches wide."
00:28:15,00:28:16,Come off it.
00:28:16,00:28:18,And Choi Gatbok got through it.
00:28:18,00:28:19,Is the story.
00:28:19,00:28:20,That's impossible.
00:28:20,00:28:21,"It sounds impossible, right?"
00:28:21,00:28:22,Is it a middle part of his name Gap?
00:28:22,00:28:23,It is.
00:28:23,00:28:24,Yeah.
00:28:24,00:28:30,He was known as the Korean Houdini and he's a yoga instructor.
00:28:30,00:28:33,And the borrower.
00:28:33,00:28:35,"It seems too tiny, doesn't it?"
00:28:35,00:28:37,That's 15 centimetres from the top.
00:28:37,00:28:38,That's nothing.
00:28:38,00:28:39,"As long as you can get your head up, you've got to get your head up."
00:28:39,00:28:43,That's a lot more than five and a half inches what you just did there.
00:28:43,00:28:48,I'm always saying that.
00:28:48,00:28:54,"But what are the bits, skull and hips, I guess, are the two challenge bits?"
00:28:54,00:28:55,Shoulders are tough as well.
00:28:55,00:28:56,"Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:28:56,00:28:57,What's your head through?
00:28:57,00:28:59,I think you might be okay.
00:28:59,00:29:01,As long as you can rotate your body in the right way.
00:29:01,00:29:05,"Have you seen those guys in Covent Garden, just in that main square up there, who put"
00:29:05,00:29:08,their entire body through a tennis racket pole?
00:29:08,00:29:12,"Captain Frodo is a performer who I've seen do that on stage at a show called, I think"
00:29:12,00:29:13,it's called Le Cleak.
00:29:13,00:29:14,Okay.
00:29:14,00:29:17,"And he does a 12-inch tennis racket, I think I've mentioned it before, and then a 10-inch"
00:29:17,00:29:18,racket.
00:29:18,00:29:22,"And also, you can move a tennis racket around, whereas a food slot in a prison in a cell wall"
00:29:22,00:29:23,stays in place.
00:29:23,00:29:24,Exactly.
00:29:24,00:29:25,It's incredible.
00:29:25,00:29:27,Does he remove the strings?
00:29:27,00:29:28,He does.
00:29:28,00:29:29,He does.
00:29:29,00:29:30,He does.
00:29:30,00:29:34,There's a guy called Henry Box Brown.
00:29:34,00:29:41,This was an enslaved American who got himself out of his slavery by asking someone to construct
00:29:41,00:29:45,a wooden box and posting himself from Virginia to Pennsylvania.
00:29:45,00:29:46,Amazing.
00:29:46,00:29:47,Posting.
00:29:47,00:29:50,"Again, so he's one of those middle names where that's been added afterwards, right?"
00:29:50,00:29:51,"It has, yeah."
00:29:51,00:29:53,He was just called Henry Brown.
00:29:53,00:29:54,Got it.
00:29:54,00:29:55,And after he did the box.
00:29:55,00:29:57,"Actually, it was a bit later."
00:29:57,00:30:01,"On the box, it said, ""Handle with care this side up."""
00:30:01,00:30:06,"And the article I read about it said, ""Several times the box was placed upside down and handled"
00:30:06,00:30:07,"without care."""
00:30:07,00:30:08,"Oh, no."
00:30:08,00:30:13,"It took him 27 hours, and he got to Philadelphia, and he posts himself to the Anti-Slavery Society"
00:30:13,00:30:14,in Philadelphia.
00:30:14,00:30:15,"Oh, my God."
00:30:15,00:30:16,So he's free when he arrived.
00:30:16,00:30:17,Awesome.
00:30:17,00:30:21,"And he then moved to Britain, and he had another career, which is related to this."
00:30:21,00:30:23,Can you guess what it was?
00:30:23,00:30:24,Postman.
00:30:24,00:30:25,No.
00:30:25,00:30:26,Postman.
00:30:26,00:30:27,"Um, removals."
00:30:27,00:30:30,"Uh, he made labels which said this way up, and he embossed them rigorously."
00:30:30,00:30:32,Did he go on Telly?
00:30:32,00:30:33,He didn't go on Telly.
00:30:33,00:30:34,It was a bit before that.
00:30:34,00:30:35,It was the 1860s.
00:30:35,00:30:36,"Um, oh, the 1860s."
00:30:36,00:30:37,Yeah.
00:30:37,00:30:38,Um.
00:30:38,00:30:39,But you're close.
00:30:39,00:30:40,There's a lot to do with packaging.
00:30:40,00:30:41,Showbiz.
00:30:41,00:30:42,"Oh, so um..."
00:30:42,00:30:43,Was he an escape artist?
00:30:43,00:30:44,He was an escape artist.
00:30:44,00:30:45,Yeah.
00:30:45,00:30:48,He became a guy who would escape from boxes.
00:30:48,00:30:49,That's great.
00:30:49,00:30:51,Tell his story and then do the escape.
00:30:51,00:30:52,Cool.
00:30:52,00:30:53,Wow.
00:30:53,00:30:54,That's so cool.
00:30:54,00:30:59,"Um, have you guys heard of Michel Vajour, who's, um, he was someone who was in prison"
00:30:59,00:31:04,"for bank robbery in Paris, and this was in 1986."
00:31:04,00:31:10,And he got his wife to spend months and months learning to fly a helicopter so that she could
00:31:10,00:31:11,rescue him.
00:31:11,00:31:16,"Um, so I say he got her, maybe she volunteered, I don't know how the letters went."
00:31:16,00:31:17,"James, your wife flies a helicopter."
00:31:17,00:31:18,"Yeah, she is."
00:31:18,00:31:19,What are you planning?
00:31:19,00:31:20,What are you planning?
00:31:20,00:31:21,You think I made friends with that chimp?
00:31:21,00:31:25,"You're going to steal some steel, aren't you?"
00:31:25,00:31:26,You're going to steal some steel.
00:31:26,00:31:31,I'm going to go into the chimp prison and my wife's going to fly me out.
00:31:31,00:31:35,She's going to lower a duffel bag from a helicopter.
00:31:35,00:31:41,I can't believe my entire scheme has been explained on this podcast.
00:31:41,00:31:47,"That might be, like, the most cool backs to different bits of the show anyone's ever"
00:31:47,00:31:48,done.
00:31:48,00:31:49,That was lovely.
00:31:49,00:31:52,"So I opened a deed, spent months learning to fly a helicopter, did fly a helicopter,"
00:31:52,00:31:54,and picked him up from the roof of the prison.
00:31:54,00:31:59,"And the way he got onto the roof, which is the only thing that he needed to do, was by"
00:31:59,00:32:04,"tricking the guards by painting some nectarines and making them look like grenades, which"
00:32:04,00:32:05,I don't know how you do.
00:32:05,00:32:07,You've got to paint shadows on them.
00:32:07,00:32:08,"Oh, painted green."
00:32:08,00:32:09,"Yeah, green."
00:32:09,00:32:10,"I think, yeah, if you're under this..."
00:32:10,00:32:11,"That's how far away you are, yeah."
00:32:11,00:32:16,"I thought you meant he'd painted nectarines onto the roof of the prison and said, ""Oh,"
00:32:16,00:32:22,"can I go pick those nectarines?"""
00:32:22,00:32:27,"Okay, it is time for fact number three, and that is James."
00:32:27,00:32:33,"Okay, and my fact this week is that in Tudor times, the guy in the crow's nest of a warship"
00:32:33,00:32:35,had to be really good at darts.
00:32:35,00:32:36,Right.
00:32:36,00:32:42,"Okay, so, is the deck of the ship painted like a dartboard?"
00:32:42,00:32:43,"Oh, yeah."
00:32:43,00:32:46,"And why is he throwing darts down at the people, his colleagues?"
00:32:46,00:32:47,"Yeah, good point."
00:32:47,00:32:48,"Yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:32:48,00:32:52,"Is it, if you see another massive ship and you think there's no way we can win this,"
00:32:52,00:32:54,why not challenge them to a game of darts and stuff?
00:32:54,00:32:55,Yeah?
00:32:55,00:32:56,"You have to accept, don't they?"
00:32:56,00:32:57,Under naval law.
00:32:57,00:32:58,"Yeah, yeah."
00:32:58,00:33:00,"No, it's not that."
00:33:00,00:33:05,"This is because there are things called fire arrows, and they were also known as darts of"
00:33:05,00:33:11,"wildfire, and they were kept by the guy in the crow's nest, and you would launch them"
00:33:11,00:33:14,at the other ship and hopefully set fire to it when you're in battle.
00:33:14,00:33:15,They were like...
00:33:15,00:33:18,"So bigger, these aren't darts that would be permitted in your local pub?"
00:33:18,00:33:19,They're not.
00:33:19,00:33:20,They were a bit bigger than that.
00:33:20,00:33:21,Right.
00:33:21,00:33:25,"They were more spear-sized than dart-sized, but they were called darts of wildfire, and"
00:33:25,00:33:30,"I read this in, I reckon this is the book with the least encouraging title that I got"
00:33:30,00:33:32,the most facts from ever.
00:33:32,00:33:39,"It's called Darts in England 1900 to 1939 by Patrick Chaplin, but it's full of amazing"
00:33:39,00:33:40,"facts, and I read it in there."
00:33:40,00:33:45,"Well, Chaplin was also straying way outside its brief, as in 1900 to 1939, these were"
00:33:45,00:33:46,not used in the First World War.
00:33:46,00:33:48,"No, no they weren't."
00:33:48,00:33:53,He did give a little bit of exposition before he got to 1900.
00:33:53,00:33:57,"So yeah, a bit unfair for me to call them darts, possibly although they did call them"
00:33:57,00:33:58,darts.
00:33:58,00:34:01,"Also a bit unfair for me to call them crow's nests, because there was no crow's nests at"
00:34:01,00:34:04,the time either.
00:34:04,00:34:08,"The term crow's nest didn't exist in the 16th century, so they would have been called mass"
00:34:08,00:34:09,tops.
00:34:09,00:34:12,And was it just a platform you put at the top of the name?
00:34:12,00:34:16,"Actually it was a little kind of barrel thing, but they just didn't call it that, and so"
00:34:16,00:34:21,"they used these on the Merry Rose for instance, and if you go to the Merry Rose Museum, they"
00:34:21,00:34:25,"say that their crow's nest there shouldn't technically be called that, it should be called"
00:34:25,00:34:26,a mass top.
00:34:26,00:34:27,That's interesting.
00:34:27,00:34:29,I assumed it was a really old term.
00:34:29,00:34:32,"I assumed it comes exactly from that period, you know, the golden age of sailor."
00:34:32,00:34:33,"You'd have thought so, but no."
00:34:33,00:34:36,"But there's, and I didn't even write his name down because I thought it was such a pointless"
00:34:36,00:34:40,"or meaningless thing to invent, because there's always credited the guy who invented the crow's"
00:34:40,00:34:44,"nest, and it is in the 19th century, and you'd think, well, crow's nest exists, what did"
00:34:44,00:34:45,he do?
00:34:45,00:34:46,"He gave them a name, didn't he?"
00:34:46,00:34:48,"Excuse me, Anna, are you referring to William Scorseseania?"
00:34:48,00:34:50,I certainly am.
00:34:50,00:34:52,Give him his rightful name.
00:34:52,00:34:53,He's not alive to get pissed off.
00:34:53,00:34:56,Let's talk about William Scorseseania.
00:34:56,00:35:04,"So he was a whaler and an Arctic explorer, and yeah, he's credited with developing the"
00:35:04,00:35:07,"crow's nest or creating the thing, which was first properly called a crow's nest, and if"
00:35:07,00:35:10,"you were up there, you were a barrel man, that was the thing."
00:35:10,00:35:17,"And he had a great family, so he had a son, William Scorseseania, who was also an explorer,"
00:35:17,00:35:23,and Scorseseania was one of the first people to scientifically record what snowflakes looked
00:35:23,00:35:24,like.
00:35:24,00:35:25,Cool.
00:35:25,00:35:26,Yeah.
00:35:26,00:35:29,He once called a polar bear and allegedly brought it to Whitby.
00:35:29,00:35:31,I'm not completely sure that's true.
00:35:31,00:35:35,"No, from Whitby, weren't they, the Scorseseania."
00:35:35,00:35:40,"And the book, ""Northern Lights"" by Philip Pullman, there is a Texan explorer in that"
00:35:40,00:35:47,"book called Lee Scorsbe, who is named after and inspired by William Scorsbe, so the name"
00:35:47,00:35:48,lives on.
00:35:48,00:35:55,"William Scorsbe's wife was called Lady Mary, and Lady was her first name, Mary was her"
00:35:55,00:35:59,"surname, and because she was born on Lady Day, so they called her Lady Mary."
00:35:59,00:36:03,"Oh, and because they wanted to trick society into embracing them."
00:36:03,00:36:04,"Oh, maybe."
00:36:04,00:36:06,She had married Lord Timothy Dexter.
00:36:06,00:36:07,Yes.
00:36:07,00:36:08,They could have been Lord and Lady.
00:36:08,00:36:10,"What was Lady Day, and does it still exist?"
00:36:10,00:36:17,"Lady Day is a religious day for the Virgin Mary, and also they did a sculpture of a crow's"
00:36:17,00:36:24,"nest in Whitby in 1994, but local historian Norman Nichols said, ""It looked more like"
00:36:24,00:36:32,"a margarine tub than a crow's nest, and even the bird on top is of an unknown species."""
00:36:32,00:36:37,"Also, there are two men in the tub, whereas a crow's nest would only ever have one person,"
00:36:37,00:36:42,and one of the people's looking through binoculars and they weren't used on ships until the 20th
00:36:42,00:36:43,century.
00:36:43,00:36:45,That's a hell of a fact check on a statue.
00:36:45,00:36:49,"And the council said that it wasn't supposed to be accurate, it was just..."
00:36:49,00:36:51,That's a cop-out as well.
00:36:51,00:36:54,"The winning entry and the competition, and they just happened to put it in Whitby because"
00:36:54,00:36:56,it was near the sea.
00:36:56,00:37:02,"That was Dan's excuse for most podcasts, but it's not meant to be accurate."
00:37:02,00:37:08,So I guess the upgrades that were done to the crow's nest in the 1800s were they had nooks
00:37:08,00:37:12,"or racks included, don't they, to accommodate your telescope, the very much 19th century"
00:37:12,00:37:18,"binoculars, and signal flags, so you could signal down to the people on the deck to say"
00:37:18,00:37:22,"there's a shark coming or whatever, and a speaking trumpet."
00:37:22,00:37:26,"So you could shout to your crew and you'd have a trumpet up there, and then often on"
00:37:26,00:37:28,deck the captain would have another trumpet to shout back.
00:37:28,00:37:29,That's great.
00:37:29,00:37:30,That's wonderful.
00:37:30,00:37:35,"And actually, apparently you had big painted arrows too, and I think painted so that they"
00:37:35,00:37:37,showed up so you could see them on deck.
00:37:37,00:37:40,And this was for pointing at a whale if you're on a wailing expedition.
00:37:40,00:37:41,"What do you mean, sorry?"
00:37:41,00:37:43,Where were the arrows painted?
00:37:43,00:37:47,"I think that they were just painted a color, a bright color, so you'd make a long wail on"
00:37:47,00:37:48,the ship.
00:37:48,00:37:49,Crow's nest.
00:37:49,00:37:50,Oh.
00:37:50,00:37:51,"So you would hold an arrow, sorry."
00:37:51,00:37:52,"Sorry, you're holding an arrow."
00:37:52,00:37:53,It's not a painter of an arrow.
00:37:53,00:37:54,That's cool.
00:37:54,00:37:56,Like someone who's trying to show you where there's a golf sail.
00:37:56,00:37:57,Yeah.
00:37:57,00:37:59,I just blank those people out.
00:37:59,00:38:04,"And those guys, no, but those guys, they all originally had worked on ships because they"
00:38:04,00:38:07,were better at pointing to things.
00:38:07,00:38:11,"According to Penn State website, Penn State University, and I don't think this is true,"
00:38:11,00:38:16,"but it was on there, it said that the crow's nest used to actually contain a crow."
00:38:16,00:38:17,Okay.
00:38:17,00:38:23,"And the navigator's because crows were used by, I know the Vikings use crows because if"
00:38:23,00:38:25,"you let one go, it'll go to land."
00:38:25,00:38:27,And so you can follow it to land.
00:38:27,00:38:28,"That was, that was a thing."
00:38:28,00:38:30,I don't think that bit's true.
00:38:30,00:38:34,"I think they were named because crows, generally speaking, build their nest quite high up at"
00:38:34,00:38:35,the top of trees.
00:38:35,00:38:36,Looks like a bird's nest.
00:38:36,00:38:37,"They look massive, don't they?"
00:38:37,00:38:38,Yeah.
00:38:38,00:38:39,Exactly.
00:38:39,00:38:43,Although there was a study in British Columbia that found 45% of crow's nests are built on
00:38:43,00:38:44,the ground.
00:38:44,00:38:45,Why?
00:38:45,00:38:47,Because there's only a few myths there.
00:38:47,00:38:50,So really all the chips crows nest should have been just on the...
00:38:50,00:38:53,45% of them should have been crows.
00:38:53,00:38:54,That's great.
00:38:54,00:38:55,And you wouldn't need the trumpet.
00:38:55,00:38:56,No.
00:38:56,00:38:57,Yeah.
00:38:57,00:38:58,Yeah.
00:38:58,00:38:59,The Titanic had a crow's nest.
00:38:59,00:39:00,Did it?
00:39:00,00:39:06,"And it was, it was tragically, it wasn't properly functional on the night the ship hit the iceberg."
00:39:06,00:39:07,Right.
00:39:07,00:39:09,"So there were two lookouts, official lookouts on the Titanic."
00:39:09,00:39:11,They were called Frederick Fleet and Reginald Lee.
00:39:11,00:39:16,And this actually might be the whole cause of the Titanic sinking to a degree.
00:39:16,00:39:19,"So the ship's second officer was a guy called David Blair, right?"
00:39:19,00:39:24,"And he was only on board from Belfast, where, you know, launched to Southampton."
00:39:24,00:39:25,Yeah.
00:39:25,00:39:26,And then it was going Southampton to New York.
00:39:26,00:39:27,Yeah.
00:39:27,00:39:28,But he got off at Southampton.
00:39:28,00:39:29,Okay.
00:39:29,00:39:35,"And when he got off the ship, he took with him a small key and the key opened the cabinet"
00:39:35,00:39:39,"in the crow's nest, which contained the binoculars and the telescope."
00:39:39,00:39:43,"So the lookouts decided, shall we break open this lock?"
00:39:43,00:39:44,No.
00:39:44,00:39:46,"They just, they were just relying on the naked eye."
00:39:46,00:39:47,Yeah.
00:39:47,00:39:52,"And they, and Frederick Fleet survived the sinking and he went to, you know, the hearings"
00:39:52,00:39:56,"afterwards and at the hearings, he said, yeah, it would have been very useful to have the"
00:39:56,00:39:58,binoculars or the telescope.
00:39:58,00:40:00,And we might have been able to get out of the way.
00:40:00,00:40:04,"And that key has survived, though, because Blair, who had got off the ship, kept it as"
00:40:04,00:40:05,"a souvenir, memento, whatever."
00:40:05,00:40:06,Really?
00:40:06,00:40:07,Chips now use it to break people.
00:40:07,00:40:08,Yeah.
00:40:08,00:40:09,Yeah.
00:40:09,00:40:10,It was auctioned off in 2007.
00:40:10,00:40:12,I think they got that wrong in Titanic.
00:40:12,00:40:16,I've got a real vision in Titanic of the lookout looking through a telescope.
00:40:16,00:40:22,"So, James Cameron, take a look, maybe go back into an edit."
00:40:22,00:40:23,I've got a lot of darts.
00:40:23,00:40:25,"Oh, let's talk about that."
00:40:25,00:40:27,Darts stuff.
00:40:27,00:40:32,"This, the guy that you got this fact from, James, Patrick Chaplin, has a fantastic website"
00:40:32,00:40:38,"where he goes heavily into the world of darts, learned so much from him."
00:40:38,00:40:43,One interesting thing that he pointed out is there's a conception that darts became
00:40:43,00:40:49,"a big game in this country when a man called Bigfoot was able to say, well, no, but this"
00:40:49,00:40:50,is real.
00:40:50,00:40:51,This is a real Bigfoot.
00:40:51,00:40:56,But how do you find it?
00:40:56,00:41:03,"William Bigfoot Anakin in 1908, courts in Leeds were saying that darts is gambling because"
00:41:03,00:41:06,it's simply just throwing it as a gamble on where it's completely random where it lands.
00:41:06,00:41:12,"And in order to prove that that wasn't the case, Bigfoot was brought into court and he"
00:41:12,00:41:16,"was asked to throw specific three double twenties, which he managed to do."
00:41:16,00:41:21,"And in doing so, showed it was a game of skill and that meant, ah, okay, this is a sport,"
00:41:21,00:41:23,therefore you are allowed to bet on it.
00:41:23,00:41:27,This in the history of darting is often presented as it changed it for the whole country.
00:41:27,00:41:31,"The seminal moment, the truth is it was more localized and it helped in a very specific"
00:41:31,00:41:32,case.
00:41:32,00:41:33,In Leeds.
00:41:33,00:41:34,"In Leeds, exactly."
00:41:34,00:41:37,"So there, this story, we're not sure if it's true or not."
00:41:37,00:41:43,"So William Anakin's grandson says it is true, but all the magistrate records from Leeds"
00:41:43,00:41:45,from 1908 are missing.
00:41:45,00:41:46,Yeah.
00:41:46,00:41:47,Suspicious.
00:41:47,00:41:48,Suspicious.
00:41:48,00:41:53,"They've been spotted halfway up the Himalayas actually, but it's never been confirmed whether"
00:41:53,00:41:54,they were really...
00:41:54,00:41:57,"There's a blurry document, but you can't quite make out the words on it."
00:41:57,00:42:01,The story is that they just told him what to hit and perhaps it was twenties and stuff
00:42:01,00:42:05,"like that, but then everyone else in the court would shout out a number and then he'd have"
00:42:05,00:42:06,to hit that.
00:42:06,00:42:09,So someone goes seven and then he'd hit the seven and someone shout out nine and he hit
00:42:09,00:42:10,the nine.
00:42:10,00:42:11,That's a great story.
00:42:11,00:42:12,I like that.
00:42:12,00:42:16,There was a study done about what you should aim for in darts.
00:42:16,00:42:21,"It was done, it was published in the Royal Statistical Society Journal and basically it was saying"
00:42:21,00:42:26,you should only aim for treble twenty if you're a very skilled player because if you are not
00:42:26,00:42:31,a skilled player and you aim for treble twenty you'll average ten point two points per throw
00:42:31,00:42:34,and if you throw totally randomly you'll average twelve point eight points per throw.
00:42:34,00:42:37,So you'll actually do less well than average because on the either side of triple twenty
00:42:37,00:42:41,"there's a five and a one, so you risk getting low scores."
00:42:41,00:42:44,But that's a very unambitious way of thinking about darts.
00:42:44,00:42:48,"It implies that no one can ever improve from the low base and just like, unless you're"
00:42:48,00:42:51,"a natural savol, you just play for your twelve."
00:42:51,00:42:56,"It just says why don't you try and improve on the baby slope down here with, you know,"
00:42:56,00:43:00,the nineteen which has less dangerous numbers around it.
00:43:00,00:43:04,"I was reading about what a sort of man sport it was, you know, women weren't allowed to"
00:43:04,00:43:08,compete with the men in their competitions as well as there wasn't really a women's
00:43:08,00:43:14,body for it for a very long time and there was a big moment for women's darts and it's
00:43:14,00:43:20,all down to the Queen Mother because the Queen Mother went and played with the King at the
00:43:20,00:43:26,time a game of darts and she beat him and she was standing a foot closer to the dark
00:43:26,00:43:30,board but she beat him twenty one by nineteen and afterwards there were headlines around
00:43:30,00:43:31,the country.
00:43:31,00:43:33,"Sorry, she beat him twenty one by nineteen."
00:43:33,00:43:34,They both threw three darts.
00:43:34,00:43:35,I see.
00:43:35,00:43:40,"And this was in the thirties, we should say, in the 1930s and and so the headlines everywhere"
00:43:40,00:43:44,women flock to follow the Queen's lead at darts and there was this moment where it looked
00:43:44,00:43:48,"quite cool because it meant that women and men were playing together, different classes"
00:43:48,00:43:49,were playing together.
00:43:49,00:43:54,It sort of transcended everything and then Bloody World War two broke out and and that
00:43:54,00:43:56,sort of put a stop to things for a while.
00:43:56,00:44:00,People stopped playing darts and then they forgot about this these Halcyon days of when
00:44:00,00:44:04,everyone came together to play darts because I think darts playing tripled after the Queen
00:44:04,00:44:06,Mother played it for a while.
00:44:06,00:44:09,"But then but you say, you know, women didn't used to be able to compete against men."
00:44:09,00:44:11,"But I mean, in almost no sports can women compete against men."
00:44:11,00:44:17,And actually darts is one of the very few where they can now is the most famous female
00:44:17,00:44:18,darts player.
00:44:18,00:44:23,"Has she just won a tournament couple of years ago, she played in the world championships"
00:44:23,00:44:26,and she beat a couple of men and she played in the men specifically the men's.
00:44:26,00:44:29,So she entered as a woman into the men's championship.
00:44:29,00:44:33,And she she says she gets a lot of shit from the female league because they feel like she's
00:44:33,00:44:35,not taking their league seriously.
00:44:35,00:44:38,I read an interview with her recently where she said you can understand that.
00:44:38,00:44:40,I think that's a complicated issue.
00:44:40,00:44:45,"Lisa Ashton as well from Bolton, I should mention her who's the best female darts player."
00:44:45,00:44:48,One interesting thing that could happen to the darts player and this is something that
00:44:48,00:44:51,has been observed in the older generations of professional darts.
00:44:51,00:44:52,It's called dartitis.
00:44:52,00:44:53,Yeah.
00:44:53,00:44:54,That's really bad.
00:44:54,00:44:59,Dartitis is a motor neurone disease without any explanation.
00:44:59,00:45:01,Some people have described it as sort of the yips.
00:45:01,00:45:03,You just it's the yips for that.
00:45:03,00:45:04,"Yeah, exactly."
00:45:04,00:45:08,"And you basically start throwing, but your brain won't let you let go of the dart."
00:45:08,00:45:12,And you just have this kind of mental barrier that stops you from being able to throw a
00:45:12,00:45:13,dart.
00:45:13,00:45:14,It's terrifying.
00:45:14,00:45:18,"And darts players are terrified of it, I think the yips is the same as choking."
00:45:18,00:45:19,Right?
00:45:19,00:45:21,"No, the yips is actually the same."
00:45:21,00:45:23,"So if you're in golf at least, this is the yips."
00:45:23,00:45:27,"So if you need to hit a very short putt, so the ball into the hole, your brain just won't"
00:45:27,00:45:30,let you push the club through the ball.
00:45:30,00:45:32,You'll kind of get close to it and you'll just kind of freeze up.
00:45:32,00:45:33,"And yeah, it's all."
00:45:33,00:45:34,And how common is this?
00:45:34,00:45:35,Does this happen to people sporadically?
00:45:35,00:45:37,"Or is it if you've got it, you've got it?"
00:45:37,00:45:38,"No, you can't."
00:45:38,00:45:42,"So Eric Bristo, who is seen, I mean, James, you know darts more, but he's basically seen"
00:45:42,00:45:44,as one of the greatest if not the greatest.
00:45:44,00:45:45,One of the greatest.
00:45:45,00:45:46,"Yeah, one of the."
00:45:46,00:45:51,Great for darts and he got it on his fifth world championship.
00:45:51,00:45:56,So he had he had dartitis and he managed to get himself out of it and he went back to
00:45:56,00:45:57,number one in the world.
00:45:57,00:45:58,But he says he had it.
00:45:58,00:45:59,He definitely had it.
00:45:59,00:46:00,Yeah.
00:46:00,00:46:01,It's amazing.
00:46:01,00:46:05,"Sid Waddell, who was a very famous, brilliant darts commentator, famously said of Eric Bristo."
00:46:05,00:46:10,"When Alexander the Great was 33, he cried salt tears because there were no more worlds"
00:46:10,00:46:11,to conquer.
00:46:11,00:46:19,Eric Bristo is only 27.
00:46:19,00:46:27,"Okay, it is time for our final fact of the show."
00:46:27,00:46:28,And that is Andy.
00:46:28,00:46:32,My fact is there is a 50 percent chance that you have a caterpillar in your mouth.
00:46:32,00:46:34,What are you talking to?
00:46:34,00:46:36,So it's everyone.
00:46:36,00:46:37,You're not addressing.
00:46:37,00:46:41,"I thought you were looking at me and I thought maybe no, no, no, no, it's not it's not a judge"
00:46:41,00:46:42,personal judgment.
00:46:42,00:46:43,Absolutely.
00:46:43,00:46:44,"You know, it's not a personal hygiene thing."
00:46:44,00:46:46,"As far as I'm aware, is that why sometimes the butterfly will eventually fly out of my"
00:46:46,00:46:47,mouth?
00:46:47,00:46:48,That's right.
00:46:48,00:46:53,"So these caterpillars, they are bacterial caterpillars."
00:46:53,00:46:58,"So they are multicellular bacteria, which are all in the line, so they look like caterpillars."
00:46:58,00:46:59,That's why they've got their name.
00:46:59,00:47:00,Okay.
00:47:00,00:47:01,Yeah.
00:47:01,00:47:02,And this is from a trick.
00:47:02,00:47:03,It's a trick.
00:47:03,00:47:07,It's a brilliant website called Small Things Considered and Jennifer Fraser wrote an article
00:47:07,00:47:08,about it.
00:47:08,00:47:09,I read it recently.
00:47:09,00:47:13,"It was featured on a website called The Browser, which I read, which I love."
00:47:13,00:47:15,And these are these bacterial caterpillars.
00:47:15,00:47:18,They cling onto the inside of your cheek and they eat you.
00:47:18,00:47:23,You are the food and they just live inside your mouth and about half of people have them.
00:47:23,00:47:25,"And they're a family of microbes, which are so hard to pronounce."
00:47:25,00:47:26,I'm going to have a go at it.
00:47:26,00:47:29,"It's nice, siriaceae."
00:47:29,00:47:30,To see you.
00:47:30,00:47:31,Nice siriaceae.
00:47:31,00:47:32,Nice.
00:47:32,00:47:35,There we go.
00:47:35,00:47:36,Yeah.
00:47:36,00:47:43,"And they've evolved to live in our oral cavity or our mouth, as the common saying has it."
00:47:43,00:47:49,The most famous member of the nice siriaceae family is nice siriaceae gonorrheaae.
00:47:49,00:47:53,"Oh, not so nice siriaceae."
00:47:53,00:47:55,So gonorrheaae is part of this family of bacteria.
00:47:55,00:48:01,"But they named after a guy called Albert Neisser, who is a German physician."
00:48:01,00:48:05,And he was the one who the gonorrhea bacteria was named after.
00:48:05,00:48:08,He did discover it.
00:48:08,00:48:09,"But yeah, it's not the greatest thing."
00:48:09,00:48:13,He also co-discovered the causative agent of leprosy as well.
00:48:13,00:48:14,Wow.
00:48:14,00:48:16,"It's called, the other guy was Hanson, I think."
00:48:16,00:48:20,"It's called Hanson's disease now, but he was the other guy who found that."
00:48:20,00:48:22,Two really palatable and attractive things.
00:48:22,00:48:23,I know.
00:48:23,00:48:27,But was there ever a Mr. gonorrhea or was that part of the...
00:48:27,00:48:31,"Gonorrhea means something out, rhea means like shooting out like diarrhea, doesn't it?"
00:48:31,00:48:35,"And I can't remember what gonorr means, but yeah, it means something else."
00:48:35,00:48:41,"But the other thing about Neisser, again, not a very nice thing, he did some quite unethical"
00:48:41,00:48:46,"clinical trials on syphilis, putting it into patients in the 1890s."
00:48:46,00:48:52,"And because he did that, the universal rule regarding human experiments and the ethical"
00:48:52,00:48:56,rules that we have now on human experiments came in because of his experiments he did
00:48:56,00:48:57,that.
00:48:57,00:48:58,Really?
00:48:58,00:48:59,Yeah.
00:48:59,00:49:03,"So we've got about, according to a study I read, 700 different species of bacteria in"
00:49:03,00:49:04,our mouth.
00:49:04,00:49:05,Absolutely.
00:49:05,00:49:06,Any given type.
00:49:06,00:49:07,"A caterpillar, maybe one of them."
00:49:07,00:49:09,And some of them stick to their own patch of mouth.
00:49:09,00:49:13,"Your mouth roof bacteria will be very different to your cheek bacteria, for example."
00:49:13,00:49:14,"It's amazing, isn't it?"
00:49:14,00:49:18,"And yeah, they just live on different continents within your face, it's pretty amazing."
00:49:18,00:49:25,"And also our mouth microbiome, our oral microbiome, is like our gut microbiome, right?"
00:49:25,00:49:29,"There's lots of talk about the gut microbiome, how everyone has their unique collection of"
00:49:29,00:49:34,"bacteria, colony of bacteria, and that helps you digest food and your immune system, etc."
00:49:34,00:49:39,"But similarly in your mouth, you've got your unique oral microbiome, and it started building"
00:49:39,00:49:45,"up basically from the moment you were born, and it doesn't change that much."
00:49:45,00:49:49,"So you'd think when you eat kind of food with certain bacteria in it, or when you put your"
00:49:49,00:49:54,"fingers in your mouth, or you don't wash your hands for ages, you'd think that you're"
00:49:54,00:50:00,"introducing new colonies, but they're just fought out because basically at birth you've"
00:50:00,00:50:03,"started forming this thing, and in fact in the womb, I found this really amazing, if"
00:50:03,00:50:09,"your mother had gum disease, or was a smoker, you are more likely to be born with pathogens"
00:50:09,00:50:12,in your mouth that dispose you to cavities and stuff.
00:50:12,00:50:13,"It's really interesting, isn't it?"
00:50:13,00:50:17,"They found that quite recently, because they thought that the first bacteria inside a baby"
00:50:17,00:50:22,"would have probably come vaginally, like as they came out, basically they thought a baby"
00:50:22,00:50:26,"would be quite sterile, but as they came out, they would pick up all of the bacteria and"
00:50:26,00:50:30,"stuff, but it turns out that the baby's already getting bacteria from the mother's mouth,"
00:50:30,00:50:35,and somehow it's going from the mother's mouth down through placentally into the baby.
00:50:35,00:50:36,Incredible.
00:50:36,00:50:39,"We're not quite sure how it happens, but because we know that the same species from one place"
00:50:39,00:50:41,"and the other, we know that's how it's coming."
00:50:41,00:50:42,That's incredible.
00:50:42,00:50:45,"And into the baby's mouth, because it ends up, because these are bacteria that belong"
00:50:45,00:50:47,"in the mouth, so they find their way."
00:50:47,00:50:48,How do you find it?
00:50:48,00:50:49,It is incredible.
00:50:49,00:50:53,"The thing that you said, Dan, about how different species live in different parts of your mouth,"
00:50:53,00:50:58,"they found that quite recently in a study where they had these fluorescent things, like"
00:50:58,00:51:01,little tag markers that they put on different types of bacteria.
00:51:01,00:51:06,"So if it was a gonorrhea bacteria, it would be blue, and if it was a stefacoccus, it'd"
00:51:06,00:51:11,"be red or whatever, and they took them all out and then saw what they were, and they"
00:51:11,00:51:14,gave them different names because they saw patterns.
00:51:14,00:51:17,"So you would have the caterpillar in your mouth, but you might also have a hedgehog,"
00:51:17,00:51:23,"a corn cob, or a cauliflower, and these are different types of bacterial colonies."
00:51:23,00:51:27,"So all four of us here, the bacteria on our tongues are more similar to each other, aren't"
00:51:27,00:51:30,"they, than the bacteria on our own teeth?"
00:51:30,00:51:31,Because we make out so much.
00:51:31,00:51:32,That's right.
00:51:32,00:51:33,Yeah.
00:51:33,00:51:34,That's exactly it.
00:51:34,00:51:37,It's how we keep this vibe between us and we wrap our teeth.
00:51:37,00:51:38,It's a pretty show-maker.
00:51:38,00:51:44,"But if you kiss someone, your tongues will be chatting to each other, but they are more"
00:51:44,00:51:46,similar than your own tongue will be with your gums.
00:51:46,00:51:47,So romantic.
00:51:47,00:51:48,"Oh, you're kidding."
00:51:48,00:51:49,Yeah.
00:51:49,00:51:51,Maybe our tongues could chat to each other.
00:51:51,00:51:54,"Sounds quite French, doesn't it?"
00:51:54,00:51:55,Yeah.
00:51:55,00:51:56,Do you know what?
00:51:56,00:51:57,Eating sweets.
00:51:57,00:51:58,"Oh, yeah."
00:51:58,00:51:59,Kids listening.
00:51:59,00:52:00,And adults.
00:52:00,00:52:01,That's allowed.
00:52:01,00:52:02,Yeah.
00:52:02,00:52:03,"And adults, yeah."
00:52:03,00:52:04,"So I'll patch kids, Andy."
00:52:04,00:52:05,Love 'em.
00:52:05,00:52:08,"But as an adult, you can eat whatever sweets you like, whereas as a kid, your parents often"
00:52:08,00:52:09,"say, ""Don't, you'll get holes in your teeth."""
00:52:09,00:52:10,Yeah.
00:52:10,00:52:11,It doesn't cause cavities.
00:52:11,00:52:12,What?
00:52:12,00:52:13,Are you sure?
00:52:13,00:52:14,Yeah.
00:52:14,00:52:15,Well.
00:52:15,00:52:17,I have to count this.
00:52:17,00:52:20,"Wait, wait for the backtrack."
00:52:20,00:52:26,"So basically, the way the cavities are formed are when bacteria living in our mouth digest"
00:52:26,00:52:32,"things that we eat, and then when they digest them, they excrete acidity, makes them very"
00:52:32,00:52:36,"acidic, and it's the acidity which rots away at your teeth."
00:52:36,00:52:44,"And some bacteria do like carbohydrates, but they don't prefer a sweet to an apple or"
00:52:44,00:52:45,some grain.
00:52:45,00:52:50,I don't think there's a connection between eating loads of quality street or whatever.
00:52:50,00:52:59,"But it is true that children are likely to snack on sweets, then some grain, as in..."
00:52:59,00:53:01,"I'm sure you were very popular in the playground, Anna."
00:53:01,00:53:02,Anna's there at the pick-and-mix.
00:53:02,00:53:05,"Oh, you know, maybe some book wheat would be nice."
00:53:05,00:53:09,I was a very advanced child.
00:53:09,00:53:10,Yeah.
00:53:10,00:53:11,"Look, that's a good point."
00:53:11,00:53:16,"But I think also the problem is that if you were to eat, like, let's say peanuts or bread"
00:53:16,00:53:21,"or something, that's more like to get stuck in your teeth, whereas the sugar tends to just"
00:53:21,00:53:22,disappear away.
00:53:22,00:53:23,"Just a doll, doesn't it?"
00:53:23,00:53:24,It goes on your throat.
00:53:24,00:53:26,"So it would be quite a good advertising campaign to say, you know, if people are trying to"
00:53:26,00:53:30,"not get cavities in their teeth, bacteria are trying to have a poo in your mouth and"
00:53:30,00:53:32,"don't let them, you know, only let them do it at mealtimes."
00:53:32,00:53:33,"Yeah, that's nice."
00:53:33,00:53:34,"Yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:53:34,00:53:35,Yeah.
00:53:35,00:53:36,That would be a motivational postcard.
00:53:36,00:53:37,Maybe a character.
00:53:37,00:53:39,You'd have like a bacterial character.
00:53:39,00:53:40,Yeah.
00:53:40,00:53:41,Yeah.
00:53:41,00:53:45,"Goes into schools, you know, a giant bacteria does a poo on the floor."
00:53:45,00:53:48,Don't let me do this in your mouth.
00:53:48,00:53:51,And then it burns a hole in the floor.
00:53:51,00:53:52,Yeah.
00:53:52,00:53:56,I think this could be a good spinoff business for us.
00:53:56,00:54:03,I had a half my tooth fell out the other night in bed and I stopped shooting on the bed post.
00:54:03,00:54:04,Just so you know that.
00:54:04,00:54:05,That's the side.
00:54:05,00:54:06,The end is very dear.
00:54:06,00:54:07,I know.
00:54:07,00:54:08,I know.
00:54:08,00:54:11,"I'm going to be a 38 year old man and my son, five years old, did our reaction because"
00:54:11,00:54:12,"I went, oh my God, I'm crumbling."
00:54:12,00:54:13,This is it.
00:54:13,00:54:15,"My son, grab me, went, dad, you're so lucky."
00:54:15,00:54:19,Put that under the pillow and you're going to make tons of money by the morning.
00:54:19,00:54:22,"But yeah, it just disappeared and I've been eating a lot of sweets because Halloween,"
00:54:22,00:54:24,we got a huge hoard off the back of the trick of treating that we did.
00:54:24,00:54:27,I think there's a correlation causation thing here.
00:54:27,00:54:28,Yeah.
00:54:28,00:54:29,Must be right.
00:54:29,00:54:30,So half your tooth fell out.
00:54:30,00:54:31,"Yeah, just fell out."
00:54:31,00:54:32,Yeah.
00:54:32,00:54:33,So you've only got half a tooth now.
00:54:33,00:54:34,"Yeah, it's still the breast."
00:54:34,00:54:35,Are you serious?
00:54:35,00:54:36,"Yeah, I'm not joking."
00:54:36,00:54:37,"I feel like you're overly concerned here, Andy."
00:54:37,00:54:38,I feel like Dan needs quite urgent attention.
00:54:38,00:54:39,I feel like you're utterly concerned.
00:54:39,00:54:48,"I have to say, because I've only got half a tooth at the back of my mouth because of"
00:54:48,00:54:51,some dental work that I never got finished because it was coming too expensive and I
00:54:51,00:54:56,"said to the dentist, it's only the back half of my tooth that I have for all the roots"
00:54:56,00:54:57,are a little bit exposed.
00:54:57,00:55:00,"And I said, if hypothetically I didn't come back and pay for you to put the crown on top"
00:55:00,00:55:02,"of this, would it be bad?"
00:55:02,00:55:06,"And the dentist said to me, look, if you were an 85 year old woman, I'd say it doesn't"
00:55:06,00:55:07,matter.
00:55:07,00:55:11,"But for a younger person, you probably want that tooth at some point in your life."
00:55:11,00:55:15,"So if you do feel like the end is nigh, it's probably not worth getting it done."
00:55:15,00:55:16,Yeah.
00:55:16,00:55:17,So that's something to reassure you.
00:55:17,00:55:18,You're saying I should leave it?
00:55:18,00:55:19,Leave it.
00:55:19,00:55:25,"I mean, Anna, that's like, I remember when I was younger, being in a cab and not having"
00:55:25,00:55:28,"much money and saying, and just, you know, you say to the cabbie, can you let me off"
00:55:28,00:55:29,here?
00:55:29,00:55:30,This is great.
00:55:30,00:55:31,You're a mile short of your destination.
00:55:31,00:55:32,Yeah.
00:55:32,00:55:33,It takes up the cash you got.
00:55:33,00:55:34,That's what I've done.
00:55:34,00:55:37,"I've done an infected wisdom tooth at the moment, while I've taken antibiotics, it's"
00:55:37,00:55:39,just about getting better.
00:55:39,00:55:42,"But I'm thinking the way that Andy's looking at all three of us at the moment, I think"
00:55:42,00:55:47,our make-out sessions might not be happening anymore.
00:55:47,00:55:51,"Okay, that's it."
00:55:51,00:55:52,That's all of our facts.
00:55:52,00:55:53,Thank you so much for listening.
