00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,880
 Hi everyone, welcome to this week's episode of No Such Things as a Fish.

2
00:00:04,880 --> 00:00:09,180
 I have three things to share with you very, very quickly before we start this week's

3
00:00:09,180 --> 00:00:15,680
 show and I will give them to you in reverse order of how much you embrace capitalism.

4
00:00:15,680 --> 00:00:22,680
 So first of all, if you go to nosuchthingsafish.com you will find that we have merch.

5
00:00:22,680 --> 00:00:25,360
 We have a whole new range of merchandise.

6
00:00:25,360 --> 00:00:29,760
 There is a tour book, which was originally only available on tour, it's got loads of

7
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:33,000
 stuff about the history of fish made lovingly by Alex Bell.

8
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:38,440
 There are pretty much the nerdiest t-shirts you've ever seen and there are pin badges.

9
00:00:38,440 --> 00:00:39,680
 They can be bought separately.

10
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:43,840
 They can be bought in a big old bundle and they are the perfect Christmas present for

11
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:49,060
 the fish listener in your life or maybe just a Christmas present to yourself.

12
00:00:49,060 --> 00:00:52,120
 Second up, well just a quick reminder about Club Fish.

13
00:00:52,120 --> 00:00:58,000
 That is the secret members area of fish where you can get ad free episodes, you can get

14
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:03,400
 loads of bonus content such as compilations and quizzes and the mail bag.

15
00:01:03,400 --> 00:01:07,240
 You can join our discord, there's all sorts of stuff up there and the way you get to that

16
00:01:07,240 --> 00:01:10,520
 is again to go to nosuchthingasafish.com.

17
00:01:10,520 --> 00:01:17,200
 Finally, if you go to nosuchthingasafish.com/ukrain then you'll get to a very special thing.

18
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:22,200
 We have teamed up with some of our friends in Kyiv and they have made a quiz which is

19
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:24,920
 based on facts from nosuchthingasafish.

20
00:01:24,920 --> 00:01:30,040
 It's on an app called The Game, it's a really cool app, it's like a quiz based on this kind

21
00:01:30,040 --> 00:01:31,800
 of slavic style of quizzing.

22
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:35,560
 The questions are really really fun and that is completely free.

23
00:01:35,560 --> 00:01:40,080
 All that we ask is that at the end of it you at least consider giving some money to U24

24
00:01:40,080 --> 00:01:45,080
 which is the main place for charitable donations in support of Ukraine to help rebuild the

25
00:01:45,080 --> 00:01:46,080
 country.

26
00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:51,880
 Okay, well that's it, three different things, buy some merch, join clubfish, do the quiz

27
00:01:51,880 --> 00:01:54,920
 and help Ukraine if you can if you have any spare money.

28
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:58,560
 And if you want to do none of those things then worry not because the podcast which will

29
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:05,040
 always be free is coming up right after I say those magic words on with the podcast.

30
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:26,480
 Hello and welcome to another episode of No Such Thing As A Fish, a weekly podcast coming

31
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:29,520
 to you from the QI offices in Covern Garden.

32
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:34,200
 My name is Dan Schreiber, I am sitting here with Andrew Hunter Murray, James Harkin and

33
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:38,440
 Anna Tyshinsky and once again we have gathered around the microphones with our four favorite

34
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:43,920
 facts from the last seven days and in a particular order, here we go.

35
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:46,920
 Starting with fact number one and that is my fact.

36
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:53,360
 My fact this week is that the 1986 ocean search to recover debris from the Challenger disaster

37
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:59,720
 also turned up 25 kilograms of cocaine, the value of which was enough to cover the $13

38
00:02:59,720 --> 00:03:02,680
 million cost of the entire search operation.

39
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:04,880
 Wow, what a shame.

40
00:03:04,880 --> 00:03:06,200
 It's which bit?

41
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:10,280
 Well no, the fact that they could have gotten that money and it would have paid for the

42
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:12,960
 whole thing but obviously you can't just go and sell your cocaine.

43
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:13,960
 Which is weird isn't it?

44
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:15,840
 You should be able to sell your cocaine.

45
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:19,600
 There should be like a government buyback program but for cocaine.

46
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:20,600
 Exactly.

47
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:21,600
 Because in the end they just burnt it right?

48
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:26,360
 So you could argue that this whole thing cost about $26 billion.

49
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:29,600
 So what this was is obviously the very tragic Challenger disaster.

50
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:35,520
 NASA sent a spaceship up in space, 73 seconds into its launch it explodes.

51
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:37,600
 That was January 1986.

52
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:41,520
 They then start the rescue mission to try and salvage any of the bits of the ship that

53
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:42,520
 they could find.

54
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:47,200
 The bit where it exploded over was just over Florida so the ocean patch that it landed

55
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:50,400
 in is a very garbage-y patched bit of ocean.

56
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:54,720
 So to find it was a very hard process because they were using sonar and when you use the

57
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:59,120
 sonar you're picking up on everything literally from garbage all the way through to shipwrecks

58
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:00,120
 and so on.

59
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:04,920
 So along the way they found the things they trawled up included marine batteries, trash

60
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:09,160
 cans, paint cans, there was half a torpedo, a refrigerator.

61
00:04:09,160 --> 00:04:11,120
 It was like everything but the kitchen sink wasn't it?

62
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:15,120
 Well it was literally not because they found a kitchen sink as well.

63
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:18,640
 Is this just a clever way of getting someone to clear up the oceans without telling them

64
00:04:18,640 --> 00:04:19,640
 they're clearing out the oceans?

65
00:04:19,640 --> 00:04:23,840
 Like when you kind of put a pee on a bit of - how do you trick children to eat healthy

66
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:24,840
 food?

67
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:25,840
 You know you put a pee on a bit of chocolate or something.

68
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:26,840
 Yeah.

69
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:27,840
 You put a pee on a bit of chocolate.

70
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:28,840
 That's it.

71
00:04:28,840 --> 00:04:38,320
 They did find a lot of cocaine in that area not just the Challenger search rescue mission.

72
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:43,680
 They found five identical duffel bags all of which had cocaine in over about a six-month

73
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:44,680
 period.

74
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:45,680
 Identical duffel bags?

75
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:46,680
 Yeah.

76
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:50,120
 So the NASA people they found the fifth one but there had been four previous duffel bags

77
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:53,520
 all full of cocaine that had been found in the area.

78
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:56,600
 It's quite a good way to hide cocaine I think in a duffel bag because I don't think people

79
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:57,600
 look in a duffel bag.

80
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:58,600
 Do you think?

81
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:02,440
 I've never said duffel bag that's many times in a short space of time but I think of duffel

82
00:05:02,440 --> 00:05:06,320
 bags as being something quite innocuous, something quite as you take to school, you have a duffel

83
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:07,320
 bag.

84
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:11,640
 Yeah but I think if you watch like certainly British gangster movies like the Guy Ritchie

85
00:05:11,640 --> 00:05:14,080
 kind of movies you can imagine them opening up a duffel bag.

86
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:15,280
 It's always in a duffel bag.

87
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:17,720
 I feel like that's your classic cocaine character.

88
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:18,720
 What's a duffel?

89
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:19,720
 What is duffel?

90
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:20,720
 Duffel is a town in Belgium.

91
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:21,720
 Is it?

92
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:22,720
 Yeah, yeah.

93
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:23,720
 I think it's a shoulder bag.

94
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:24,720
 Yeah.

95
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:25,720
 Oh a shoulder bag.

96
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:26,720
 I associate it with crime.

97
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:27,720
 Definitely.

98
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:29,720
 What are you thinking of?

99
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:32,280
 I think of duffel as a light blue cloth.

100
00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:34,040
 Yeah, that's what I'm thinking as well.

101
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:35,040
 Oh okay, okay.

102
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:36,040
 Right.

103
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:37,040
 Well, yeah.

104
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:41,440
 But also I would argue that duffel bag doesn't get an exemption from when you walk in to

105
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:44,800
 say a building and they have security checks not to be opened.

106
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:46,240
 They normally wave you through.

107
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:49,160
 Excuse me sir, is that a duffel bag?

108
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:53,400
 But from the Belgian town, yeah, come on through, yeah that's fine.

109
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:58,920
 These five identical duffel bags full of cocaine, four of them, they managed to get the cocaine

110
00:05:58,920 --> 00:06:01,360
 and they managed to destroy it.

111
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:04,960
 Can you guess what happened to the fifth amount of cocaine?

112
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:08,600
 So there's another duffel bag full of cocaine which they never destroyed.

113
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:09,600
 Went into a museum?

114
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:12,760
 The cocaine museum, yeah.

115
00:06:12,760 --> 00:06:15,640
 Very good glass cases on those exhibits.

116
00:06:15,640 --> 00:06:16,640
 The audio guide.

117
00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:17,720
 Yes you're going through the cocaine museum now.

118
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:23,000
 Yes, if you look on your left hand side this is a really good exhibit.

119
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:28,680
 It went missing, it was put into a sixth duffel bag and smuggled out that way.

120
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:34,320
 No it was found by a party boat just off the coast of Florida and they found this massive

121
00:06:34,320 --> 00:06:38,920
 bag of cocaine and thought they're not going to believe us if we take this back so they

122
00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:46,920
 emptied all of the cocaine back into the sea and they took it off, 25 kilos as a party.

123
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:49,920
 And what happened to the duffel bags, do we know?

124
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:53,280
 Well I don't know.

125
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:55,480
 Often what would happen is they would sell them on, wouldn't they?

126
00:06:55,480 --> 00:07:00,120
 The police or the Coast Guard would, if they find stuff and it's not illegal, they have

127
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:05,160
 like auctions and stuff so there might have been, if you'd have seen a lot of four identical

128
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:06,160
 duffel bags.

129
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:10,160
 Do you think, and if you got your head right in one and really sniffed away at the lining,

130
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:11,840
 you could definitely get a hit I'd imagine.

131
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:12,840
 Definitely.

132
00:07:12,840 --> 00:07:13,840
 Do you think?

133
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:15,100
 It's not up, isn't it cocaine?

134
00:07:15,100 --> 00:07:16,720
 I'm not an expert on drugs.

135
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:18,960
 I don't think you put it in the bag loose.

136
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:19,960
 No, that's fair.

137
00:07:19,960 --> 00:07:20,960
 That is fair.

138
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:27,640
 Can I just quickly ask about the duffel bags, do we know if it was part of a shipwrecked

139
00:07:27,640 --> 00:07:28,640
 or what?

140
00:07:28,640 --> 00:07:32,320
 We don't know where they came from these duffel bags, presumably some kind of nefarious

141
00:07:32,320 --> 00:07:33,320
 activity.

142
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:34,320
 Yeah.

143
00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:36,760
 But we're not, no they were, that's kind of the mystery is where they came from.

144
00:07:36,760 --> 00:07:37,760
 Right.

145
00:07:37,760 --> 00:07:38,760
 What a great ad for duffel bags though.

146
00:07:38,760 --> 00:07:39,760
 They're so resilient.

147
00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:40,760
 It's podcast.

148
00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:41,760
 Yeah, it is.

149
00:07:41,760 --> 00:07:43,320
 I think you can just find them floating in the ocean.

150
00:07:43,320 --> 00:07:45,680
 They might have survived the plane crash or a sunken ship.

151
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:49,240
 Well, we don't know what kind of state the cocaine was in, it might have been unsnortable.

152
00:07:49,240 --> 00:07:50,320
 It could have been drenched.

153
00:07:50,320 --> 00:07:53,960
 You know when you eat some crab meat sometimes and there's a tiny little bit of crab shell

154
00:07:53,960 --> 00:07:55,960
 in, do you reckon it's the same with snorting cocaine?

155
00:07:55,960 --> 00:07:57,680
 You're like, oh, there's a bit of shell in this.

156
00:07:57,680 --> 00:07:58,680
 Yeah, yeah.

157
00:07:58,680 --> 00:07:59,680
 I think it is, yeah.

158
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:00,680
 Duffel bags.

159
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:05,920
 I was looking up pharmaceutical things found on shipwrecks and I think I found maybe the

160
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:10,880
 oldest example of this being found, so this was discovered in 1990, not from 1990.

161
00:08:10,880 --> 00:08:17,200
 These archaeologists found an ancient Greek shipwreck and there were pills on board that

162
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:18,360
 they were able to retrieve.

163
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:19,520
 Can you imagine that?

164
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:20,520
 Wow.

165
00:08:20,520 --> 00:08:21,520
 I know.

166
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:24,840
 They were in a duffel bag that had been, obviously they weren't.

167
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:28,080
 But then the scientists were able to analyse them and we know what people were taking as

168
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:31,000
 medicine because we literally have surviving medicine from ancient Greece.

169
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,000
 So you have what they are?

170
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,000
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

171
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:37,320
 Lots of different ingredients which were all sort of faintly vegetable or herbal.

172
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:42,160
 So celery, carrot, radish, wild onion, oak, cabbage and a few other things.

173
00:08:42,160 --> 00:08:47,200
 And they were kind of, I think we've been able to tie them to recipes or medical manuals

174
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:49,440
 from the time that said, oh, this is good for lots of things.

175
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:51,680
 And these are kind of cure-all pills, basically.

176
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:52,680
 Lots of different ailments.

177
00:08:52,680 --> 00:08:53,680
 That's incredible.

178
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:54,680
 How's that?

179
00:08:54,680 --> 00:08:55,680
 Wow.

180
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:56,680
 It's basically a vitamin pill, right?

181
00:08:56,680 --> 00:08:57,680
 Pretty much.

182
00:08:57,680 --> 00:09:00,320
 You should have given them to Crabtree and Evelyn.

183
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:01,320
 Crabtree and Evelyn.

184
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:07,280
 Crabtree and Evelyn is that shop that sells, it's quite expensive.

185
00:09:07,280 --> 00:09:11,820
 It's expensive, herbal stuff, which I'm sure is very useful for a lot of people.

186
00:09:11,820 --> 00:09:12,820
 Sure.

187
00:09:12,820 --> 00:09:14,800
 Do you guys don't know Crabtree and Evelyn?

188
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:16,680
 I'm afraid it hasn't hit Bolton, I don't think.

189
00:09:16,680 --> 00:09:17,680
 I mean, there are just shops.

190
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:19,640
 There's one bit, about 10 yards from our office.

191
00:09:19,640 --> 00:09:20,640
 Is there?

192
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:21,640
 Yeah, literally 10 yards from the office.

193
00:09:21,640 --> 00:09:22,640
 Oh, is that not Holland and Barrett?

194
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:23,640
 Holland and Barrett.

195
00:09:23,640 --> 00:09:24,640
 That's what I'm thinking of.

196
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:25,640
 Holland and Barrett.

197
00:09:25,640 --> 00:09:26,640
 Crabtree and Evelyn.

198
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:27,640
 Crabtree and Evelyn.

199
00:09:27,640 --> 00:09:31,720
 If you know who Crabtree and Evelyn are, then please write it.

200
00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:36,080
 I think maybe Crabtree and Evelyn is another version of Holland and Barrett.

201
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:37,080
 I don't know.

202
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:44,560
 I feel like it sounds like two elderly detectives from a Richard Osmond novel, doesn't it?

203
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:48,600
 I really thought you guys looked like the idiots in that.

204
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:49,600
 Wow.

205
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:52,600
 Yeah, we weak herbal cures.

206
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:58,440
 So lots of shipwrecks that exist at the moment are being stolen.

207
00:09:58,440 --> 00:10:02,680
 There's a thriving market in shipwreck theft, which I had never heard of before reading

208
00:10:02,680 --> 00:10:03,680
 about this.

209
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:08,800
 So it's Matt, 40 second world warships that were sunk have already been partly or totally

210
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:12,440
 just removed from the ocean, and it's because they're incredibly valuable.

211
00:10:12,440 --> 00:10:13,680
 Can you guess why?

212
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:14,680
 Yes.

213
00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:15,680
 Okay, great.

214
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:16,680
 Let me tell you why.

215
00:10:16,680 --> 00:10:17,680
 I read the article.

216
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:23,160
 So they contain something which we need today, like Euclia stuff, like uranium.

217
00:10:23,160 --> 00:10:24,160
 Oh, you're so close.

218
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:26,760
 It's they're made of something that we need today.

219
00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:31,480
 So they're made of iPhones, very forward thinking.

220
00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:36,320
 No, they're made of steel, lots of them, but they're made of steel that was cast before

221
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:37,320
 the year 1945.

222
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:42,720
 When nuclear testing started, they're made of something called low background steel.

223
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:45,040
 And that's incredibly valuable.

224
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:46,240
 Scientists use it, don't they?

225
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:50,480
 Scientists need loads of it for medical equipment, Geiger counters, space sensors, and all steel

226
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:53,840
 that you make these days because it uses atmospheric air in the production is slightly

227
00:10:53,840 --> 00:10:55,280
 radioactive.

228
00:10:55,280 --> 00:11:00,600
 So this stuff is really valuable and also low radiation lead is used.

229
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:04,440
 And a few years ago, they used a 2000 year old shipwreck.

230
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:07,200
 The Italian Institute of Nuclear Physics used it.

231
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:09,880
 They cut it up to make a neutrino detector.

232
00:11:09,880 --> 00:11:13,040
 And there's a bit of a hoohar about it at the time because, you know, it's sort of controversial

233
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:17,160
 and yeah, but it's worth 20 times as much as normal lead, low background lead.

234
00:11:17,160 --> 00:11:21,280
 It's really and but there is one bit of good news, which is that this, you know, the steel

235
00:11:21,280 --> 00:11:23,760
 is all steel today is radioactive.

236
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:27,960
 It's getting less radioactive because we're not doing as many nuclear tests anymore.

237
00:11:27,960 --> 00:11:32,400
 Well, at least there's no danger of nuclear war in the next year or so.

238
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:36,640
 At the moment, at the time of recording, background radiation is decreasing.

239
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:42,000
 No, I've just thought, if you are a supervillain who just got a load of this iron, it's in

240
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:45,960
 your best interest to kind of start another nuclear war, isn't it?

241
00:11:45,960 --> 00:11:48,320
 Because you want the value to increase.

242
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:49,320
 Yeah.

243
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:50,320
 That's terrible.

244
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:51,320
 That's a James Bond plot.

245
00:11:51,320 --> 00:11:55,480
 It's a classic James Bond very convoluted way of making money as opposed to trading.

246
00:11:55,480 --> 00:11:56,480
 I love it.

247
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:58,960
 But it is, I mean, it's hard getting stuff off ships.

248
00:11:58,960 --> 00:12:03,640
 It's hard getting ships up like the salvage, the technology of salvage is so cool.

249
00:12:03,640 --> 00:12:04,640
 They do.

250
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:07,640
 I was reading about when they salvaged the Costa Concordia member that sunk in the med

251
00:12:07,640 --> 00:12:14,040
 in 2012 and they have armbands basically to get them back up to the surface.

252
00:12:14,040 --> 00:12:17,040
 It's too late for armbands.

253
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:22,720
 It's kind of made of steel, probably stolen from some other sunk in ship.

254
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:27,800
 They're called Sponsons and they are these projections that they attach to the side of

255
00:12:27,800 --> 00:12:28,800
 the ship.

256
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:30,240
 So you've got a ship on the floor of the ocean.

257
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:31,240
 It's on its side.

258
00:12:31,240 --> 00:12:36,320
 First of all, you'll fill one Sponson with water and the other with air and so that will

259
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:40,200
 tip the ship upright as the air one lifts in the water.

260
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:44,840
 But the water one is weighed down and then you'll get rid of the water that's in the

261
00:12:44,840 --> 00:12:45,840
 heavier one.

262
00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:49,840
 So they've both got air in them and then that just floats it up to the surface like

263
00:12:49,840 --> 00:12:50,840
 a pair of armbands.

264
00:12:50,840 --> 00:12:51,840
 Pretty cool.

265
00:12:51,840 --> 00:12:58,240
 It is quite cool and I think they did that to Costa Concordia I think and like USSR.

266
00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:01,120
 Why did they do it to Costa, why didn't they just leave it?

267
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:02,120
 Yeah, good question.

268
00:13:02,120 --> 00:13:05,800
 Like these things with the really expensive iron, I see why you would do that or if you

269
00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:07,520
 had a galley with loads of gold coins.

270
00:13:07,520 --> 00:13:08,520
 Yeah.

271
00:13:08,520 --> 00:13:11,400
 It feels like Costa Concordia would just have, you know, like a pool table.

272
00:13:11,400 --> 00:13:15,760
 I think it was on its, wasn't it poking out of the water?

273
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:16,760
 Yeah.

274
00:13:16,760 --> 00:13:17,760
 It wasn't quite fully in.

275
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:18,760
 I think it wasn't fully submerged.

276
00:13:18,760 --> 00:13:24,160
 I think it probably blocking other traffic and also useful for scrapers, I guess.

277
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:29,660
 But I think in those cases where you had court cases and so on, I think it's part of the

278
00:13:29,660 --> 00:13:33,120
 working out the insurance and all that sort of stuff, isn't it?

279
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:34,640
 Did it definitely hit in the way it did?

280
00:13:34,640 --> 00:13:37,360
 Let's look and see whether you have to look into that kind of stuff.

281
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:39,680
 I suppose that's what they were doing with Challenger, wasn't it?

282
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:40,680
 A lot of it.

283
00:13:40,680 --> 00:13:41,680
 Yeah.

284
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:44,160
 It was like an investigation as much as trying to salvage anything.

285
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:45,160
 Yeah.

286
00:13:45,160 --> 00:13:46,160
 Mentioning Challenger again very quickly.

287
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:47,160
 Big Bird was meant to be on Challenger.

288
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:48,160
 Oh yeah.

289
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:51,360
 The last minute thing that, well, it wasn't super last minute.

290
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:52,360
 It was...

291
00:13:52,360 --> 00:13:53,360
 Quit still.

292
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:54,360
 Pause.

293
00:13:54,360 --> 00:13:56,360
 Three, two, wait.

294
00:13:56,360 --> 00:13:57,360
 Yeah.

295
00:13:57,360 --> 00:14:03,360
 Three, ah, ah, ah, ah, two, ah, ah, ah, ah.

296
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:08,720
 Yeah, the actor was asked to go in and be part of the mission.

297
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:09,720
 Gosh.

298
00:14:09,720 --> 00:14:13,000
 I think his name was Carol Spinney and he, and it was all going to go ahead, but then

299
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:16,720
 they realized that the Big Bird costume was way too big to get in there.

300
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:20,200
 And there's a very sad account, actually, of them at Sesame Street watching the Challenger

301
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:22,680
 go up and Carol Spinney going, "Oh, I was meant to be on that."

302
00:14:22,680 --> 00:14:24,960
 And then the explosion and the sort of the realization.

303
00:14:24,960 --> 00:14:25,960
 Wow.

304
00:14:25,960 --> 00:14:26,960
 Yeah.

305
00:14:26,960 --> 00:14:27,960
 Really, really horrible.

306
00:14:27,960 --> 00:14:28,960
 Yeah.

307
00:14:28,960 --> 00:14:33,000
 Something else that washes up that we've never mentioned on this show is feet.

308
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,000
 Human feet.

309
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,000
 And human feet.

310
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,000
 Okay.

311
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,240
 Yeah, I was just looking at weird stuff found in the ocean.

312
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:39,240
 Oh yeah.

313
00:14:39,240 --> 00:14:40,760
 And I found out why.

314
00:14:40,760 --> 00:14:42,840
 So do you remember this mystery it started about?

315
00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:45,480
 Do we know why?

316
00:14:45,480 --> 00:14:46,880
 We can speculate reliably.

317
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:50,640
 So they kept finding like, was it like just left feet or something?

318
00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:51,640
 No, it wasn't.

319
00:14:51,640 --> 00:14:53,720
 I think it was, it was basically feet overall.

320
00:14:53,720 --> 00:14:54,720
 Okay.

321
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:55,720
 There was a while when a few left ones I found.

322
00:14:55,720 --> 00:14:56,720
 There was shod feet, weren't they?

323
00:14:56,720 --> 00:14:57,720
 Yeah.

324
00:14:57,720 --> 00:14:58,720
 There was shod feet.

325
00:14:58,720 --> 00:14:59,720
 Yes.

326
00:14:59,720 --> 00:15:00,720
 Wearing a shoe.

327
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:06,020
 Usually used to refer to horses, but in Andy's case, apparently, to refer to the people.

328
00:15:06,020 --> 00:15:07,020
 Where was this?

329
00:15:07,020 --> 00:15:08,020
 Was this globally?

330
00:15:08,020 --> 00:15:09,020
 They were rocking up on shorelines?

331
00:15:09,020 --> 00:15:10,020
 No.

332
00:15:10,020 --> 00:15:11,020
 This was the old thing.

333
00:15:11,020 --> 00:15:14,560
 It was specifically in Canada, or Vancouver Island, in a place called the Salish Sea.

334
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:19,920
 So it's just like near the border with the U.S. And from 2007, over the course of 12

335
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:24,800
 years, 15 different feet within shoes washed up.

336
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:28,520
 And the shoes were all sneakers, except one shoe, which was a walking boot.

337
00:15:28,520 --> 00:15:31,520
 That sounds irrelevant, but it's not.

338
00:15:31,520 --> 00:15:32,520
 Oh.

339
00:15:32,520 --> 00:15:35,640
 And everyone was, there were lots of theories, obviously, about who had been assassinated

340
00:15:35,640 --> 00:15:37,280
 and had their feet chopped off.

341
00:15:37,280 --> 00:15:43,400
 So this woman, Gail Anderson, who studies things like this, how things decompose, sank

342
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:48,240
 a bunch of dead pigs into the Salish Sea to see how they decompose.

343
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:49,240
 Were they shod?

344
00:15:49,240 --> 00:15:50,240
 Yeah.

345
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:54,320
 They actually were not shod because that was something, because you can't fit a sneaker

346
00:15:54,320 --> 00:16:00,700
 on a pig, I think, as the old saying goes.

347
00:16:00,700 --> 00:16:04,440
 They've got trotters, though, which have a different, I imagine, float profile.

348
00:16:04,440 --> 00:16:05,440
 Yeah.

349
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:06,440
 I think they do.

350
00:16:06,440 --> 00:16:10,520
 So in an ideal world, she would have sunk a human body, but there are issues around

351
00:16:10,520 --> 00:16:11,520
 that.

352
00:16:11,520 --> 00:16:14,480
 So I would definitely give my consent for a weird experiment like that.

353
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:15,480
 I know me, too.

354
00:16:15,480 --> 00:16:16,480
 If there was a use for an...

355
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:17,480
 I would say, orally, you just have.

356
00:16:17,480 --> 00:16:18,480
 Oh, yeah.

357
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:19,480
 Yeah.

358
00:16:19,480 --> 00:16:21,400
 If there's any mad scientist listening.

359
00:16:21,400 --> 00:16:23,640
 Whoever gets me first gets me for...

360
00:16:23,640 --> 00:16:25,440
 Is that legally possible?

361
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:26,440
 I'm sure.

362
00:16:26,440 --> 00:16:27,440
 Wow.

363
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:28,440
 Okay.

364
00:16:28,440 --> 00:16:29,440
 Great.

365
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:31,440
 There should definitely be a thing you can check, donate my body to weird science.

366
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:34,200
 You can donate your body to science, but I need it to be...

367
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:35,200
 Specifically, yeah.

368
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:36,200
 Something.

369
00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:37,200
 Yeah.

370
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:39,200
 Specifically, no such thing as a fish-worthy science.

371
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:40,200
 Anyway.

372
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:41,200
 Oh, yeah, trotters.

373
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:44,520
 Basically, the conclusion was that they get eaten by crustaceans pretty quickly, but

374
00:16:44,520 --> 00:16:49,200
 in your ankles, you've got basically soft tissue like tendons, joints, ligaments, stuff

375
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:50,200
 like that.

376
00:16:50,200 --> 00:16:51,720
 So they can eat through all of that.

377
00:16:51,720 --> 00:16:56,560
 And because there's a trend in this area over the last 20 years for trainers, which have

378
00:16:56,560 --> 00:16:57,560
 air bubbles in them.

379
00:16:57,560 --> 00:16:58,760
 Like nike-airs and stuff.

380
00:16:58,760 --> 00:16:59,760
 Nike-airs.

381
00:16:59,760 --> 00:17:03,360
 They pop up to the surface and bob along to a beach.

382
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:04,360
 But the feet are remaining.

383
00:17:04,360 --> 00:17:05,360
 The feet haven't been eaten.

384
00:17:05,360 --> 00:17:06,360
 No, because that's what...

385
00:17:06,360 --> 00:17:08,360
 I think they're probably skeleton feet inside the show at this point.

386
00:17:08,360 --> 00:17:09,360
 I suppose, yeah.

387
00:17:09,360 --> 00:17:13,400
 You kind of eat the ankle and then you kind of turn around to start eating the foot, but

388
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:15,440
 it's already floating away kind of thing.

389
00:17:15,440 --> 00:17:19,720
 It's kind of amazing that crabs and lobsters also find it hard to get to the difficult

390
00:17:19,720 --> 00:17:20,720
 bits of humans.

391
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:21,720
 Yeah.

392
00:17:21,720 --> 00:17:24,720
 They should have a special human fork.

393
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:25,720
 Yeah, exactly.

394
00:17:25,720 --> 00:17:26,720
 Wow.

395
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:27,720
 It's really crazy.

396
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:28,720
 Oh, I'm not ordering the human.

397
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:29,720
 No.

398
00:17:29,720 --> 00:17:30,720
 I can't, no.

399
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:31,720
 I've just got a new shirt.

400
00:17:31,720 --> 00:17:32,720
 Okay.

401
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:41,120
 It is time for fact number two and that is Anna.

402
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:45,680
 My fact this week is that chimps will help to break you out of prison, but only if they

403
00:17:45,680 --> 00:17:48,680
 like you.

404
00:17:48,680 --> 00:17:51,200
 So is it a good idea to befriend some chimps?

405
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:52,200
 Before the bank job.

406
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:53,200
 Before the bank job.

407
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:54,760
 Go straight from the sanctuary to...

408
00:17:54,760 --> 00:17:55,760
 Yeah.

409
00:17:55,760 --> 00:18:00,840
 I would say it depends if the prison you're aimed for is staffed by chimps, which very

410
00:18:00,840 --> 00:18:01,840
 few are.

411
00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:02,840
 Yeah.

412
00:18:02,840 --> 00:18:03,840
 Yeah.

413
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:06,480
 So I don't know how many practical benefits this is going to have for you, but this...

414
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:11,380
 I think I originally read this a while ago in a book called Mental Leaps by Keith Holyoke,

415
00:18:11,380 --> 00:18:14,960
 which is really good, but it's about this specific chimp called Sarah on whom lots of

416
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:17,120
 experiments were done in the 80s.

417
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:22,160
 We might have mentioned her before and they were done by David and Anna Premack and they

418
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:26,880
 were trying to suss out basically the extent to which chimps have empathy and a theory

419
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:31,480
 of mind so they can understand that other beings are conscious beings just like them.

420
00:18:31,480 --> 00:18:37,120
 And so they did this amazing experiment where they showed her videos of actors trapped in

421
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:42,480
 a cage and then they showed her pictures, like various grainy black and white pictures

422
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:43,480
 of various objects.

423
00:18:43,480 --> 00:18:47,960
 So it would be like a key that could let her out of the cage, let the actor out of the

424
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:52,400
 cage and then a book and then a crowbar and then a poo or whatever.

425
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:56,240
 And I think you've made a mistake in describing this that you've included crowbar, which also

426
00:18:56,240 --> 00:18:57,880
 can be used to get you out of prison.

427
00:18:57,880 --> 00:19:00,720
 It should have been the key and then a lot of things that you can't use.

428
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:05,920
 And in fact, a book can help you on your journey out of prison through education.

429
00:19:05,920 --> 00:19:06,920
 Yeah.

430
00:19:06,920 --> 00:19:07,920
 Right.

431
00:19:07,920 --> 00:19:08,920
 That is a more long form, isn't it?

432
00:19:08,920 --> 00:19:09,920
 You're absolutely right.

433
00:19:09,920 --> 00:19:13,480
 I've picked the one other object that would have confused the hell out of poor Sarah and

434
00:19:13,480 --> 00:19:14,480
 Chimp.

435
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:15,480
 I got confused though.

436
00:19:15,480 --> 00:19:16,480
 Yeah, yeah.

437
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:17,480
 I'm so sorry.

438
00:19:17,480 --> 00:19:18,480
 Flingy poo at the guard.

439
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:19,480
 He's distracted.

440
00:19:19,480 --> 00:19:20,480
 You're over the wall.

441
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:21,480
 Hey, you should be reading your book.

442
00:19:21,480 --> 00:19:22,480
 Right.

443
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:25,360
 I'm just going to say they gave her a key.

444
00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:28,320
 They showed her a picture of a key and then brought three other things that can't get

445
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:29,320
 you out of prison.

446
00:19:29,320 --> 00:19:30,320
 Yeah.

447
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:32,360
 They showed her how to pick the picture of the key.

448
00:19:32,360 --> 00:19:36,320
 So that was like, she knows that this actor wants to get out of prison and she's managed

449
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:40,600
 to match up this image, grainy image, and figure out that that's what the actor would

450
00:19:40,600 --> 00:19:41,600
 want.

451
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:42,600
 Right.

452
00:19:42,600 --> 00:19:43,600
 And then there were lots of other stuff as well.

453
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:45,960
 So they'd show actors trying to reach a banana that's just out of reach beyond the

454
00:19:45,960 --> 00:19:50,640
 cage or trying to reach up to a banana that was on the ceiling and couldn't get to it.

455
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:58,960
 And they'd show her pictures of a ladder, a box, a jet pack, not a ladder, not a ladder.

456
00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:01,960
 And then three other things that you can't do.

457
00:20:01,960 --> 00:20:02,960
 Exactly.

458
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:04,600
 A ladder and then a pole to get a banana.

459
00:20:04,600 --> 00:20:07,280
 Do they then give her the choice to help people?

460
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:08,280
 Yes.

461
00:20:08,280 --> 00:20:09,280
 Okay.

462
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:13,240
 So, well, then they did the experiment with two different people, Keith, her favorite

463
00:20:13,240 --> 00:20:14,240
 trainer.

464
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:18,560
 And in the study, it says, Bill, Brackett's fictitious name because I guess didn't want

465
00:20:18,560 --> 00:20:19,560
 to be identified.

466
00:20:19,560 --> 00:20:20,560
 Oh.

467
00:20:20,560 --> 00:20:22,560
 Someone who she didn't like.

468
00:20:22,560 --> 00:20:26,800
 And she would choose the good versions for Keith so she'd get him the banana by giving

469
00:20:26,800 --> 00:20:32,440
 him the pole or let him out of prison, but for Bill, she chose bad outcomes for him.

470
00:20:32,440 --> 00:20:36,480
 So there'd be pictures of, for instance, Bill, like, sprawled out, having tripped over

471
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:38,040
 the box isn't on the floor.

472
00:20:38,040 --> 00:20:40,740
 And she'd pick that one for him because he wasn't a fan.

473
00:20:40,740 --> 00:20:41,740
 What's Bill worried about?

474
00:20:41,740 --> 00:20:42,740
 How interesting.

475
00:20:42,740 --> 00:20:43,740
 What does he want?

476
00:20:43,740 --> 00:20:45,240
 No one to know his name?

477
00:20:45,240 --> 00:20:46,240
 I guess.

478
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:47,240
 Because chimps don't like it.

479
00:20:47,240 --> 00:20:48,240
 It's embarrassing.

480
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:49,240
 If a chimp doesn't like him, what's he done to the chimp?

481
00:20:49,240 --> 00:20:50,240
 Yeah.

482
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:51,240
 Oh, I see.

483
00:20:51,240 --> 00:20:52,240
 Oh, there's an implication there.

484
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:53,240
 Yeah.

485
00:20:53,240 --> 00:20:54,240
 I don't think we're...

486
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:56,240
 I guess he just doesn't like, what, his music taste?

487
00:20:56,240 --> 00:20:59,280
 I think Bill's doing some dark stuff.

488
00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:00,280
 Okay.

489
00:21:00,280 --> 00:21:04,400
 There's no suggestion in the study that Bill did anything untoward.

490
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:07,160
 We should actually, if you're going to say stuff like that, then we should change his

491
00:21:07,160 --> 00:21:09,360
 name again so that people don't know.

492
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:10,360
 Oh, yeah.

493
00:21:10,360 --> 00:21:11,360
 Yeah, Mark.

494
00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:14,320
 And actually, I might change my name just so that they don't know it was me, so I'll

495
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:15,320
 be Gary.

496
00:21:15,320 --> 00:21:16,320
 Wow.

497
00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:20,560
 Anyway, it's just so incredible the mental leaps that they can make, understanding.

498
00:21:20,560 --> 00:21:21,560
 This is a person.

499
00:21:21,560 --> 00:21:22,560
 It's a person I like.

500
00:21:22,560 --> 00:21:23,560
 I want to help them.

501
00:21:23,560 --> 00:21:24,560
 I don't want to say it.

502
00:21:24,560 --> 00:21:25,560
 I think they're smart.

503
00:21:25,560 --> 00:21:27,000
 I think chimpanzees are pretty clever.

504
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:28,000
 Chimps.

505
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:29,000
 Yeah.

506
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:30,000
 It depends what you compare them to.

507
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:31,000
 That's true.

508
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:32,000
 Yeah.

509
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:33,000
 If you compare them to Slavoj Zizek, they're not very smart.

510
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:34,000
 But if you compare them to me...

511
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:37,000
 If you compare them to Gary over here...

512
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:43,880
 But the one thing they do is they will...

513
00:21:43,880 --> 00:21:46,800
 This is kind of, again, their friendship to enemy ratio.

514
00:21:46,800 --> 00:21:48,200
 They have enemy lists.

515
00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:49,200
 Do they?

516
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:50,200
 Yeah.

517
00:21:50,200 --> 00:21:51,200
 Wow.

518
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:52,200
 And the article I read said, "This is why chimpanzees are like Richard Nixon, which I think is

519
00:21:52,200 --> 00:21:53,200
 a bit unfair."

520
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:57,480
 So this is a scientist from the Max Planck Institute.

521
00:21:57,480 --> 00:22:00,800
 They observed wild chimpanzees for thousands of hours in a row, right?

522
00:22:00,800 --> 00:22:01,800
 Yeah.

523
00:22:01,800 --> 00:22:03,920
 And what do chimpanzees spend lots of their time doing?

524
00:22:03,920 --> 00:22:04,920
 Grooming each other.

525
00:22:04,920 --> 00:22:05,920
 Grooming.

526
00:22:05,920 --> 00:22:06,920
 Yeah.

527
00:22:06,920 --> 00:22:07,920
 And it's a big thing.

528
00:22:07,920 --> 00:22:09,120
 And it's a huge part of their social life as well.

529
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:14,240
 And basically, they have a very, very sophisticated mental map of who has groomed them recently,

530
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:15,240
 who they've groomed.

531
00:22:15,240 --> 00:22:18,800
 And it's effectively who owes them a pint, you know, is that kind of social level.

532
00:22:18,800 --> 00:22:21,680
 So they will be able to return the favor for someone who's groomed them.

533
00:22:21,680 --> 00:22:25,780
 And they will freeze out other chimpanzees who haven't groomed them or who are selfish

534
00:22:25,780 --> 00:22:27,520
 and never groom anyone else.

535
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:34,040
 And then do they break into their offices at the middle of the night and steal documents?

536
00:22:34,040 --> 00:22:41,000
 So for example, if Dan groomed James on Monday, then on Thursday, James might groom Dan back.

537
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:42,680
 And the system works just fine.

538
00:22:42,680 --> 00:22:45,640
 As in, it doesn't need to be the same day for it to be, you know, that's for like...

539
00:22:45,640 --> 00:22:47,680
 I've slept three times, but I still remember it.

540
00:22:47,680 --> 00:22:48,680
 Exactly.

541
00:22:48,680 --> 00:22:53,240
 And like, Dan knows not to worry about it because he knows that you've got his back,

542
00:22:53,240 --> 00:22:54,240
 basically.

543
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:58,240
 But, you know, if Dan grooms Anna on a Tuesday and there's nothing for the rest of the week

544
00:22:58,240 --> 00:23:02,240
 and the week after that, Dan will remember and is not to be trusted with this thing.

545
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:03,240
 And, you know...

546
00:23:03,240 --> 00:23:04,240
 I just like...

547
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:05,240
 He's a hairy man.

548
00:23:05,240 --> 00:23:06,240
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

549
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:07,240
 It doesn't feel...

550
00:23:07,240 --> 00:23:08,240
 It's a normal work.

551
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:09,240
 Yeah, yeah.

552
00:23:09,240 --> 00:23:10,240
 You're right.

553
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:11,240
 We've got a lot on.

554
00:23:11,240 --> 00:23:17,520
 All gym research is so interesting and I was listening to actually show what the interview

555
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:21,600
 Jane Goodall recently and it's so interesting listening to her, obviously it's maybe the

556
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:27,960
 most famous chimp researcher ever, but when she started researching, she went to Tanzania,

557
00:23:27,960 --> 00:23:31,820
 she was the first person who saw chimps using tools, I think, using sticks to catch insects.

558
00:23:31,820 --> 00:23:37,760
 She got PhD at Cambridge based on that, but she got there and she was vilified and all

559
00:23:37,760 --> 00:23:40,800
 the other academics said, "You're doing this completely wrong," because she wanted to look

560
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:45,160
 at chimp's personality and emotion and at the time, everyone else said, "That's really

561
00:23:45,160 --> 00:23:49,760
 unscientific, it doesn't make any sense, you're humanising these chimps, they're just animals."

562
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:53,240
 Whereas she obviously was saying, "I've lived with these chimps, they're really similar

563
00:23:53,240 --> 00:23:58,320
 to us, the only way to understand them is by trying to look at them through these lenses."

564
00:23:58,320 --> 00:23:59,320
 Wow.

565
00:23:59,320 --> 00:24:00,320
 So, yeah, she was...

566
00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:01,320
 She was bitched about.

567
00:24:01,320 --> 00:24:04,440
 So, she would give them names and the scientists would like, "You can't give them names, that

568
00:24:04,440 --> 00:24:05,440
 is wild."

569
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:11,080
 Well, she was part of a group of three women who were put together by Louis Leakey, who

570
00:24:11,080 --> 00:24:14,360
 was a paleoanthropologist and amazing character in this world.

571
00:24:14,360 --> 00:24:18,600
 And he was the one who thought that they needed studying at different closer contact and so

572
00:24:18,600 --> 00:24:24,080
 he wanted three women who he thought weren't necessarily even qualified for doing the job

573
00:24:24,080 --> 00:24:27,480
 and he wanted them to be single and he wanted to send them out there.

574
00:24:27,480 --> 00:24:32,040
 And so, he found Jane Goodall, he found Diane Fosse, and then there was a third one, unfortunately,

575
00:24:32,040 --> 00:24:35,600
 whose name I can't remember, and they were known as the Trimates or Leakey's Angels and

576
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:36,600
 they would go out there.

577
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:37,600
 Leakey's Angels?

578
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:38,600
 Yeah.

579
00:24:38,600 --> 00:24:39,600
 Why did they have to be single?

580
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:40,680
 Is that in case they fell in love with the chimps?

581
00:24:40,680 --> 00:24:43,400
 I think he was a bit of a eccentric character.

582
00:24:43,400 --> 00:24:47,600
 So, no, he was very much married, but he just had these eccentric ways.

583
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:50,520
 He sent her a letter saying, "You've got to have your appendix taken out before you

584
00:24:50,520 --> 00:24:51,520
 go out there."

585
00:24:51,520 --> 00:24:54,840
 She did it and then he wrote back saying, "Oh, I was joking about that."

586
00:24:54,840 --> 00:24:58,080
 Oh, my God, that is a good prank.

587
00:24:58,080 --> 00:25:01,680
 He wanted to test who had the commitment to go out there was the joke of it and then

588
00:25:01,680 --> 00:25:03,000
 he said, "Oh, you actually did it?"

589
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:04,200
 No, no, it was a joke.

590
00:25:04,200 --> 00:25:05,680
 He was just a jokey thing.

591
00:25:05,680 --> 00:25:09,120
 But if he was testing the commitment, it sounds like, you know, if he hadn't done it, he might

592
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:10,560
 have been like, "You didn't pass the test."

593
00:25:10,560 --> 00:25:14,040
 My theory is he was back working on that to be like, "Oh, yeah, no, I was testing your

594
00:25:14,040 --> 00:25:15,040
 commitment."

595
00:25:15,040 --> 00:25:21,640
 Jane Goodall, by the way, I have a Barbie of Jane Goodall, which is like my equivalent

596
00:25:21,640 --> 00:25:23,800
 of Dan buying Ben Elton stuff.

597
00:25:23,800 --> 00:25:25,320
 What does it come with?

598
00:25:25,320 --> 00:25:29,860
 It comes with a little monkey, a little chimp, which is the David Greybeard chimp, which

599
00:25:29,860 --> 00:25:33,080
 is the one who she first saw using a stick as a tool.

600
00:25:33,080 --> 00:25:36,560
 You know, she properly believes a Bigfoot, like properly.

601
00:25:36,560 --> 00:25:37,560
 And I saw her recently.

602
00:25:37,560 --> 00:25:41,600
 Did you get this stuff out of these otherwise sane people?

603
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:42,600
 It's bizarre.

604
00:25:42,600 --> 00:25:46,320
 There's this American program, which is called something like Bigfoot Uncovered or something.

605
00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:50,880
 It looks really kind of amateur, and yet Jane Goodall sat down for a major interview with

606
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:56,040
 them and told all her anecdotal evidence that she believes that locals believe that it and

607
00:25:56,040 --> 00:25:57,040
 so on.

608
00:25:57,040 --> 00:26:02,680
 Did you not write a letter afterwards saying I was only joking about that, by the way?

609
00:26:02,680 --> 00:26:04,000
 I would just get a scar.

610
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:07,080
 I would just get an appendectomy scar if someone asked me to do that.

611
00:26:07,080 --> 00:26:08,080
 Smart.

612
00:26:08,080 --> 00:26:11,920
 In most places where you're asked to have it removed, you probably do will have need

613
00:26:11,920 --> 00:26:12,920
 to have had it removed.

614
00:26:12,920 --> 00:26:16,160
 Yeah, most people aren't doing it for jokes, are they?

615
00:26:16,160 --> 00:26:17,160
 No.

616
00:26:17,160 --> 00:26:21,560
 How funny that little novelty scar is going to be when you're out in that isolated area.

617
00:26:21,560 --> 00:26:25,040
 No doctors are there.

618
00:26:25,040 --> 00:26:27,760
 Chimpanzees, they have their own theme tunes.

619
00:26:27,760 --> 00:26:29,360
 I really like this.

620
00:26:29,360 --> 00:26:30,360
 Really?

621
00:26:30,360 --> 00:26:31,360
 Yeah.

622
00:26:31,360 --> 00:26:32,360
 Just like Richard Nixon did.

623
00:26:32,360 --> 00:26:36,920
 They have, this is bizarre, they have these drum rhythms, male chimpanzees.

624
00:26:36,920 --> 00:26:40,800
 When they're traveling, they will bash really loudly.

625
00:26:40,800 --> 00:26:45,280
 They grab a big old tree root and they bash it against the surface of a tree and the specific

626
00:26:45,280 --> 00:26:50,760
 male chimpanzees have their own specific tunes or rhythms that they bash out and it's to

627
00:26:50,760 --> 00:26:54,600
 advertise their presence basically.

628
00:26:54,600 --> 00:26:59,400
 There's a primatologist called Catherine Hobaita who found this out and basically they can

629
00:26:59,400 --> 00:27:01,960
 decide whether they want to hang out with each other or not.

630
00:27:01,960 --> 00:27:03,560
 It's a bit social media-ish.

631
00:27:03,560 --> 00:27:04,560
 They're saying, I'm here.

632
00:27:04,560 --> 00:27:05,560
 I don't want to hang out.

633
00:27:05,560 --> 00:27:06,560
 I'm here.

634
00:27:06,560 --> 00:27:10,720
 Sounds more sophisticated than social media, to be honest.

635
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:16,400
 But they also can be on incognito mode if they like and it's just not hitting the tree

636
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:17,400
 with the thing.

637
00:27:17,400 --> 00:27:20,000
 Or you can steal someone's identity, couldn't you?

638
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:25,680
 You know, get your own blue tick now by imitating their own blue stick.

639
00:27:25,680 --> 00:27:34,040
 Can I tell you guys about my favorite prison break of all time with the facts about breaking

640
00:27:34,040 --> 00:27:35,400
 human's out of prison?

641
00:27:35,400 --> 00:27:39,080
 This is a prisoner in South Korea who broke themselves out.

642
00:27:39,080 --> 00:27:42,720
 His name was Choi Gatbok and this was in 2012.

643
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:48,480
 He was in jail for five days off the back of his arrest and he escaped by squeezing his

644
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:51,480
 entire body through the food slot.

645
00:27:51,480 --> 00:27:55,600
 That is amazing.

646
00:27:55,600 --> 00:27:59,240
 So when you're in prison, you see this on prison dramas, right?

647
00:27:59,240 --> 00:28:03,840
 They come in with a tray with your food in, they open a little slot, they slide it under.

648
00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:06,280
 It's about the size of a letter box.

649
00:28:06,280 --> 00:28:07,780
 It's so tiny.

650
00:28:07,780 --> 00:28:15,320
 So the slot was 5.9 inches tall, 17.5 inches wide.

651
00:28:15,320 --> 00:28:16,320
 Come off it.

652
00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:18,640
 And Choi Gatbok got through it.

653
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:19,640
 Is the story.

654
00:28:19,640 --> 00:28:20,640
 That's impossible.

655
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:21,640
 It sounds impossible, right?

656
00:28:21,640 --> 00:28:22,880
 Is it a middle part of his name Gap?

657
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:23,880
 It is.

658
00:28:23,880 --> 00:28:24,880
 Yeah.

659
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:30,360
 He was known as the Korean Houdini and he's a yoga instructor.

660
00:28:30,360 --> 00:28:33,800
 And the borrower.

661
00:28:33,800 --> 00:28:35,300
 It seems too tiny, doesn't it?

662
00:28:35,300 --> 00:28:37,040
 That's 15 centimetres from the top.

663
00:28:37,040 --> 00:28:38,040
 That's nothing.

664
00:28:38,040 --> 00:28:39,760
 As long as you can get your head up, you've got to get your head up.

665
00:28:39,760 --> 00:28:43,520
 That's a lot more than five and a half inches what you just did there.

666
00:28:43,520 --> 00:28:48,760
 I'm always saying that.

667
00:28:48,760 --> 00:28:54,200
 But what are the bits, skull and hips, I guess, are the two challenge bits?

668
00:28:54,200 --> 00:28:55,200
 Shoulders are tough as well.

669
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:56,200
 Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

670
00:28:56,200 --> 00:28:57,200
 What's your head through?

671
00:28:57,200 --> 00:28:59,000
 I think you might be okay.

672
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:01,800
 As long as you can rotate your body in the right way.

673
00:29:01,800 --> 00:29:05,960
 Have you seen those guys in Covent Garden, just in that main square up there, who put

674
00:29:05,960 --> 00:29:08,640
 their entire body through a tennis racket pole?

675
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:12,960
 Captain Frodo is a performer who I've seen do that on stage at a show called, I think

676
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:13,960
 it's called Le Cleak.

677
00:29:13,960 --> 00:29:14,960
 Okay.

678
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:17,720
 And he does a 12-inch tennis racket, I think I've mentioned it before, and then a 10-inch

679
00:29:17,720 --> 00:29:18,720
 racket.

680
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:22,400
 And also, you can move a tennis racket around, whereas a food slot in a prison in a cell wall

681
00:29:22,400 --> 00:29:23,400
 stays in place.

682
00:29:23,400 --> 00:29:24,400
 Exactly.

683
00:29:24,400 --> 00:29:25,400
 It's incredible.

684
00:29:25,400 --> 00:29:27,280
 Does he remove the strings?

685
00:29:27,280 --> 00:29:28,280
 He does.

686
00:29:28,280 --> 00:29:29,280
 He does.

687
00:29:29,280 --> 00:29:30,280
 He does.

688
00:29:30,280 --> 00:29:34,800
 There's a guy called Henry Box Brown.

689
00:29:34,800 --> 00:29:41,720
 This was an enslaved American who got himself out of his slavery by asking someone to construct

690
00:29:41,720 --> 00:29:45,640
 a wooden box and posting himself from Virginia to Pennsylvania.

691
00:29:45,640 --> 00:29:46,640
 Amazing.

692
00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:47,640
 Posting.

693
00:29:47,640 --> 00:29:50,960
 Again, so he's one of those middle names where that's been added afterwards, right?

694
00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:51,960
 It has, yeah.

695
00:29:51,960 --> 00:29:53,560
 He was just called Henry Brown.

696
00:29:53,560 --> 00:29:54,560
 Got it.

697
00:29:54,560 --> 00:29:55,560
 And after he did the box.

698
00:29:55,560 --> 00:29:57,840
 Actually, it was a bit later.

699
00:29:57,840 --> 00:30:01,780
 On the box, it said, "Handle with care this side up."

700
00:30:01,780 --> 00:30:06,120
 And the article I read about it said, "Several times the box was placed upside down and handled

701
00:30:06,120 --> 00:30:07,120
 without care."

702
00:30:07,120 --> 00:30:08,120
 Oh, no.

703
00:30:08,120 --> 00:30:13,200
 It took him 27 hours, and he got to Philadelphia, and he posts himself to the Anti-Slavery Society

704
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:14,200
 in Philadelphia.

705
00:30:14,200 --> 00:30:15,200
 Oh, my God.

706
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:16,200
 So he's free when he arrived.

707
00:30:16,200 --> 00:30:17,200
 Awesome.

708
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:21,760
 And he then moved to Britain, and he had another career, which is related to this.

709
00:30:21,760 --> 00:30:23,000
 Can you guess what it was?

710
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:24,000
 Postman.

711
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:25,000
 No.

712
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:26,000
 Postman.

713
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:27,000
 Um, removals.

714
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:30,760
 Uh, he made labels which said this way up, and he embossed them rigorously.

715
00:30:30,760 --> 00:30:32,440
 Did he go on Telly?

716
00:30:32,440 --> 00:30:33,440
 He didn't go on Telly.

717
00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:34,440
 It was a bit before that.

718
00:30:34,440 --> 00:30:35,440
 It was the 1860s.

719
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:36,440
 Um, oh, the 1860s.

720
00:30:36,440 --> 00:30:37,440
 Yeah.

721
00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:38,440
 Um.

722
00:30:38,440 --> 00:30:39,440
 But you're close.

723
00:30:39,440 --> 00:30:40,440
 There's a lot to do with packaging.

724
00:30:40,440 --> 00:30:41,440
 Showbiz.

725
00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:42,440
 Oh, so um...

726
00:30:42,440 --> 00:30:43,440
 Was he an escape artist?

727
00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:44,440
 He was an escape artist.

728
00:30:44,440 --> 00:30:45,440
 Yeah.

729
00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:48,720
 He became a guy who would escape from boxes.

730
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:49,720
 That's great.

731
00:30:49,720 --> 00:30:51,160
 Tell his story and then do the escape.

732
00:30:51,160 --> 00:30:52,160
 Cool.

733
00:30:52,160 --> 00:30:53,160
 Wow.

734
00:30:53,160 --> 00:30:54,160
 That's so cool.

735
00:30:54,160 --> 00:30:59,400
 Um, have you guys heard of Michel Vajour, who's, um, he was someone who was in prison

736
00:30:59,400 --> 00:31:04,560
 for bank robbery in Paris, and this was in 1986.

737
00:31:04,560 --> 00:31:10,840
 And he got his wife to spend months and months learning to fly a helicopter so that she could

738
00:31:10,840 --> 00:31:11,840
 rescue him.

739
00:31:11,840 --> 00:31:16,560
 Um, so I say he got her, maybe she volunteered, I don't know how the letters went.

740
00:31:16,560 --> 00:31:17,960
 James, your wife flies a helicopter.

741
00:31:17,960 --> 00:31:18,960
 Yeah, she is.

742
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:19,960
 What are you planning?

743
00:31:19,960 --> 00:31:20,960
 What are you planning?

744
00:31:20,960 --> 00:31:21,960
 You think I made friends with that chimp?

745
00:31:21,960 --> 00:31:25,960
 You're going to steal some steel, aren't you?

746
00:31:25,960 --> 00:31:26,960
 You're going to steal some steel.

747
00:31:26,960 --> 00:31:31,720
 I'm going to go into the chimp prison and my wife's going to fly me out.

748
00:31:31,720 --> 00:31:35,720
 She's going to lower a duffel bag from a helicopter.

749
00:31:35,720 --> 00:31:41,680
 I can't believe my entire scheme has been explained on this podcast.

750
00:31:41,680 --> 00:31:47,040
 That might be, like, the most cool backs to different bits of the show anyone's ever

751
00:31:47,040 --> 00:31:48,040
 done.

752
00:31:48,040 --> 00:31:49,040
 That was lovely.

753
00:31:49,040 --> 00:31:52,200
 So I opened a deed, spent months learning to fly a helicopter, did fly a helicopter,

754
00:31:52,200 --> 00:31:54,480
 and picked him up from the roof of the prison.

755
00:31:54,480 --> 00:31:59,000
 And the way he got onto the roof, which is the only thing that he needed to do, was by

756
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:04,600
 tricking the guards by painting some nectarines and making them look like grenades, which

757
00:32:04,600 --> 00:32:05,600
 I don't know how you do.

758
00:32:05,600 --> 00:32:07,160
 You've got to paint shadows on them.

759
00:32:07,160 --> 00:32:08,160
 Oh, painted green.

760
00:32:08,160 --> 00:32:09,160
 Yeah, green.

761
00:32:09,160 --> 00:32:10,160
 I think, yeah, if you're under this...

762
00:32:10,160 --> 00:32:11,160
 That's how far away you are, yeah.

763
00:32:11,160 --> 00:32:16,040
 I thought you meant he'd painted nectarines onto the roof of the prison and said, "Oh,

764
00:32:16,040 --> 00:32:22,320
 can I go pick those nectarines?"

765
00:32:22,320 --> 00:32:27,880
 Okay, it is time for fact number three, and that is James.

766
00:32:27,880 --> 00:32:33,640
 Okay, and my fact this week is that in Tudor times, the guy in the crow's nest of a warship

767
00:32:33,640 --> 00:32:35,840
 had to be really good at darts.

768
00:32:35,840 --> 00:32:36,840
 Right.

769
00:32:36,840 --> 00:32:42,480
 Okay, so, is the deck of the ship painted like a dartboard?

770
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:43,480
 Oh, yeah.

771
00:32:43,480 --> 00:32:46,480
 And why is he throwing darts down at the people, his colleagues?

772
00:32:46,480 --> 00:32:47,480
 Yeah, good point.

773
00:32:47,480 --> 00:32:48,480
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

774
00:32:48,480 --> 00:32:52,240
 Is it, if you see another massive ship and you think there's no way we can win this,

775
00:32:52,240 --> 00:32:54,800
 why not challenge them to a game of darts and stuff?

776
00:32:54,800 --> 00:32:55,800
 Yeah?

777
00:32:55,800 --> 00:32:56,800
 You have to accept, don't they?

778
00:32:56,800 --> 00:32:57,800
 Under naval law.

779
00:32:57,800 --> 00:32:58,800
 Yeah, yeah.

780
00:32:58,800 --> 00:33:00,160
 No, it's not that.

781
00:33:00,160 --> 00:33:05,920
 This is because there are things called fire arrows, and they were also known as darts of

782
00:33:05,920 --> 00:33:11,160
 wildfire, and they were kept by the guy in the crow's nest, and you would launch them

783
00:33:11,160 --> 00:33:14,960
 at the other ship and hopefully set fire to it when you're in battle.

784
00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:15,960
 They were like...

785
00:33:15,960 --> 00:33:18,240
 So bigger, these aren't darts that would be permitted in your local pub?

786
00:33:18,240 --> 00:33:19,240
 They're not.

787
00:33:19,240 --> 00:33:20,240
 They were a bit bigger than that.

788
00:33:20,240 --> 00:33:21,240
 Right.

789
00:33:21,240 --> 00:33:25,840
 They were more spear-sized than dart-sized, but they were called darts of wildfire, and

790
00:33:25,840 --> 00:33:30,880
 I read this in, I reckon this is the book with the least encouraging title that I got

791
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:32,960
 the most facts from ever.

792
00:33:32,960 --> 00:33:39,760
 It's called Darts in England 1900 to 1939 by Patrick Chaplin, but it's full of amazing

793
00:33:39,760 --> 00:33:40,760
 facts, and I read it in there.

794
00:33:40,760 --> 00:33:45,240
 Well, Chaplin was also straying way outside its brief, as in 1900 to 1939, these were

795
00:33:45,240 --> 00:33:46,400
 not used in the First World War.

796
00:33:46,400 --> 00:33:48,280
 No, no they weren't.

797
00:33:48,280 --> 00:33:53,400
 He did give a little bit of exposition before he got to 1900.

798
00:33:53,400 --> 00:33:57,560
 So yeah, a bit unfair for me to call them darts, possibly although they did call them

799
00:33:57,560 --> 00:33:58,560
 darts.

800
00:33:58,560 --> 00:34:01,520
 Also a bit unfair for me to call them crow's nests, because there was no crow's nests at

801
00:34:01,520 --> 00:34:04,000
 the time either.

802
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:08,520
 The term crow's nest didn't exist in the 16th century, so they would have been called mass

803
00:34:08,520 --> 00:34:09,520
 tops.

804
00:34:09,520 --> 00:34:12,280
 And was it just a platform you put at the top of the name?

805
00:34:12,280 --> 00:34:16,880
 Actually it was a little kind of barrel thing, but they just didn't call it that, and so

806
00:34:16,880 --> 00:34:21,640
 they used these on the Merry Rose for instance, and if you go to the Merry Rose Museum, they

807
00:34:21,640 --> 00:34:25,400
 say that their crow's nest there shouldn't technically be called that, it should be called

808
00:34:25,400 --> 00:34:26,400
 a mass top.

809
00:34:26,400 --> 00:34:27,400
 That's interesting.

810
00:34:27,400 --> 00:34:29,000
 I assumed it was a really old term.

811
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:32,160
 I assumed it comes exactly from that period, you know, the golden age of sailor.

812
00:34:32,160 --> 00:34:33,480
 You'd have thought so, but no.

813
00:34:33,480 --> 00:34:36,520
 But there's, and I didn't even write his name down because I thought it was such a pointless

814
00:34:36,520 --> 00:34:40,520
 or meaningless thing to invent, because there's always credited the guy who invented the crow's

815
00:34:40,520 --> 00:34:44,040
 nest, and it is in the 19th century, and you'd think, well, crow's nest exists, what did

816
00:34:44,040 --> 00:34:45,040
 he do?

817
00:34:45,040 --> 00:34:46,040
 He gave them a name, didn't he?

818
00:34:46,040 --> 00:34:48,040
 Excuse me, Anna, are you referring to William Scorseseania?

819
00:34:48,040 --> 00:34:50,040
 I certainly am.

820
00:34:50,040 --> 00:34:52,000
 Give him his rightful name.

821
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:53,600
 He's not alive to get pissed off.

822
00:34:53,600 --> 00:34:56,280
 Let's talk about William Scorseseania.

823
00:34:56,280 --> 00:35:04,280
 So he was a whaler and an Arctic explorer, and yeah, he's credited with developing the

824
00:35:04,280 --> 00:35:07,600
 crow's nest or creating the thing, which was first properly called a crow's nest, and if

825
00:35:07,600 --> 00:35:10,560
 you were up there, you were a barrel man, that was the thing.

826
00:35:10,560 --> 00:35:17,280
 And he had a great family, so he had a son, William Scorseseania, who was also an explorer,

827
00:35:17,280 --> 00:35:23,080
 and Scorseseania was one of the first people to scientifically record what snowflakes looked

828
00:35:23,080 --> 00:35:24,080
 like.

829
00:35:24,080 --> 00:35:25,080
 Cool.

830
00:35:25,080 --> 00:35:26,080
 Yeah.

831
00:35:26,080 --> 00:35:29,040
 He once called a polar bear and allegedly brought it to Whitby.

832
00:35:29,040 --> 00:35:31,120
 I'm not completely sure that's true.

833
00:35:31,120 --> 00:35:35,160
 No, from Whitby, weren't they, the Scorseseania.

834
00:35:35,160 --> 00:35:40,200
 And the book, "Northern Lights" by Philip Pullman, there is a Texan explorer in that

835
00:35:40,200 --> 00:35:47,340
 book called Lee Scorsbe, who is named after and inspired by William Scorsbe, so the name

836
00:35:47,340 --> 00:35:48,340
 lives on.

837
00:35:48,340 --> 00:35:55,160
 William Scorsbe's wife was called Lady Mary, and Lady was her first name, Mary was her

838
00:35:55,160 --> 00:35:59,480
 surname, and because she was born on Lady Day, so they called her Lady Mary.

839
00:35:59,480 --> 00:36:03,000
 Oh, and because they wanted to trick society into embracing them.

840
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:04,000
 Oh, maybe.

841
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:06,000
 She had married Lord Timothy Dexter.

842
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:07,000
 Yes.

843
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:08,000
 They could have been Lord and Lady.

844
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:10,240
 What was Lady Day, and does it still exist?

845
00:36:10,240 --> 00:36:17,800
 Lady Day is a religious day for the Virgin Mary, and also they did a sculpture of a crow's

846
00:36:17,800 --> 00:36:24,800
 nest in Whitby in 1994, but local historian Norman Nichols said, "It looked more like

847
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:32,040
 a margarine tub than a crow's nest, and even the bird on top is of an unknown species."

848
00:36:32,040 --> 00:36:37,960
 Also, there are two men in the tub, whereas a crow's nest would only ever have one person,

849
00:36:37,960 --> 00:36:42,120
 and one of the people's looking through binoculars and they weren't used on ships until the 20th

850
00:36:42,120 --> 00:36:43,120
 century.

851
00:36:43,120 --> 00:36:45,960
 That's a hell of a fact check on a statue.

852
00:36:45,960 --> 00:36:49,680
 And the council said that it wasn't supposed to be accurate, it was just...

853
00:36:49,680 --> 00:36:51,160
 That's a cop-out as well.

854
00:36:51,160 --> 00:36:54,840
 The winning entry and the competition, and they just happened to put it in Whitby because

855
00:36:54,840 --> 00:36:56,160
 it was near the sea.

856
00:36:56,160 --> 00:37:02,480
 That was Dan's excuse for most podcasts, but it's not meant to be accurate.

857
00:37:02,480 --> 00:37:08,320
 So I guess the upgrades that were done to the crow's nest in the 1800s were they had nooks

858
00:37:08,320 --> 00:37:12,440
 or racks included, don't they, to accommodate your telescope, the very much 19th century

859
00:37:12,440 --> 00:37:18,760
 binoculars, and signal flags, so you could signal down to the people on the deck to say

860
00:37:18,760 --> 00:37:22,680
 there's a shark coming or whatever, and a speaking trumpet.

861
00:37:22,680 --> 00:37:26,000
 So you could shout to your crew and you'd have a trumpet up there, and then often on

862
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:28,920
 deck the captain would have another trumpet to shout back.

863
00:37:28,920 --> 00:37:29,920
 That's great.

864
00:37:29,920 --> 00:37:30,920
 That's wonderful.

865
00:37:30,920 --> 00:37:35,600
 And actually, apparently you had big painted arrows too, and I think painted so that they

866
00:37:35,600 --> 00:37:37,680
 showed up so you could see them on deck.

867
00:37:37,680 --> 00:37:40,880
 And this was for pointing at a whale if you're on a wailing expedition.

868
00:37:40,880 --> 00:37:41,880
 What do you mean, sorry?

869
00:37:41,880 --> 00:37:43,120
 Where were the arrows painted?

870
00:37:43,120 --> 00:37:47,000
 I think that they were just painted a color, a bright color, so you'd make a long wail on

871
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:48,000
 the ship.

872
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:49,000
 Crow's nest.

873
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:50,000
 Oh.

874
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:51,000
 So you would hold an arrow, sorry.

875
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:52,000
 Sorry, you're holding an arrow.

876
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:53,000
 It's not a painter of an arrow.

877
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:54,000
 That's cool.

878
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:56,280
 Like someone who's trying to show you where there's a golf sail.

879
00:37:56,280 --> 00:37:57,280
 Yeah.

880
00:37:57,280 --> 00:37:59,080
 I just blank those people out.

881
00:37:59,080 --> 00:38:04,840
 And those guys, no, but those guys, they all originally had worked on ships because they

882
00:38:04,840 --> 00:38:07,720
 were better at pointing to things.

883
00:38:07,720 --> 00:38:11,720
 According to Penn State website, Penn State University, and I don't think this is true,

884
00:38:11,720 --> 00:38:16,880
 but it was on there, it said that the crow's nest used to actually contain a crow.

885
00:38:16,880 --> 00:38:17,880
 Okay.

886
00:38:17,880 --> 00:38:23,880
 And the navigator's because crows were used by, I know the Vikings use crows because if

887
00:38:23,880 --> 00:38:25,800
 you let one go, it'll go to land.

888
00:38:25,800 --> 00:38:27,400
 And so you can follow it to land.

889
00:38:27,400 --> 00:38:28,720
 That was, that was a thing.

890
00:38:28,720 --> 00:38:30,040
 I don't think that bit's true.

891
00:38:30,040 --> 00:38:34,960
 I think they were named because crows, generally speaking, build their nest quite high up at

892
00:38:34,960 --> 00:38:35,960
 the top of trees.

893
00:38:35,960 --> 00:38:36,960
 Looks like a bird's nest.

894
00:38:36,960 --> 00:38:37,960
 They look massive, don't they?

895
00:38:37,960 --> 00:38:38,960
 Yeah.

896
00:38:38,960 --> 00:38:39,960
 Exactly.

897
00:38:39,960 --> 00:38:43,480
 Although there was a study in British Columbia that found 45% of crow's nests are built on

898
00:38:43,480 --> 00:38:44,480
 the ground.

899
00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:45,480
 Why?

900
00:38:45,480 --> 00:38:47,480
 Because there's only a few myths there.

901
00:38:47,480 --> 00:38:50,600
 So really all the chips crows nest should have been just on the...

902
00:38:50,600 --> 00:38:53,720
 45% of them should have been crows.

903
00:38:53,720 --> 00:38:54,720
 That's great.

904
00:38:54,720 --> 00:38:55,720
 And you wouldn't need the trumpet.

905
00:38:55,720 --> 00:38:56,720
 No.

906
00:38:56,720 --> 00:38:57,720
 Yeah.

907
00:38:57,720 --> 00:38:58,720
 Yeah.

908
00:38:58,720 --> 00:38:59,720
 The Titanic had a crow's nest.

909
00:38:59,720 --> 00:39:00,720
 Did it?

910
00:39:00,720 --> 00:39:06,240
 And it was, it was tragically, it wasn't properly functional on the night the ship hit the iceberg.

911
00:39:06,240 --> 00:39:07,240
 Right.

912
00:39:07,240 --> 00:39:09,320
 So there were two lookouts, official lookouts on the Titanic.

913
00:39:09,320 --> 00:39:11,920
 They were called Frederick Fleet and Reginald Lee.

914
00:39:11,920 --> 00:39:16,480
 And this actually might be the whole cause of the Titanic sinking to a degree.

915
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:19,840
 So the ship's second officer was a guy called David Blair, right?

916
00:39:19,840 --> 00:39:24,120
 And he was only on board from Belfast, where, you know, launched to Southampton.

917
00:39:24,120 --> 00:39:25,120
 Yeah.

918
00:39:25,120 --> 00:39:26,120
 And then it was going Southampton to New York.

919
00:39:26,120 --> 00:39:27,120
 Yeah.

920
00:39:27,120 --> 00:39:28,120
 But he got off at Southampton.

921
00:39:28,120 --> 00:39:29,120
 Okay.

922
00:39:29,120 --> 00:39:35,840
 And when he got off the ship, he took with him a small key and the key opened the cabinet

923
00:39:35,840 --> 00:39:39,440
 in the crow's nest, which contained the binoculars and the telescope.

924
00:39:39,440 --> 00:39:43,960
 So the lookouts decided, shall we break open this lock?

925
00:39:43,960 --> 00:39:44,960
 No.

926
00:39:44,960 --> 00:39:46,960
 They just, they were just relying on the naked eye.

927
00:39:46,960 --> 00:39:47,960
 Yeah.

928
00:39:47,960 --> 00:39:52,080
 And they, and Frederick Fleet survived the sinking and he went to, you know, the hearings

929
00:39:52,080 --> 00:39:56,080
 afterwards and at the hearings, he said, yeah, it would have been very useful to have the

930
00:39:56,080 --> 00:39:58,160
 binoculars or the telescope.

931
00:39:58,160 --> 00:40:00,440
 And we might have been able to get out of the way.

932
00:40:00,440 --> 00:40:04,200
 And that key has survived, though, because Blair, who had got off the ship, kept it as

933
00:40:04,200 --> 00:40:05,840
 a souvenir, memento, whatever.

934
00:40:05,840 --> 00:40:06,840
 Really?

935
00:40:06,840 --> 00:40:07,840
 Chips now use it to break people.

936
00:40:07,840 --> 00:40:08,840
 Yeah.

937
00:40:08,840 --> 00:40:09,840
 Yeah.

938
00:40:09,840 --> 00:40:10,840
 It was auctioned off in 2007.

939
00:40:10,840 --> 00:40:12,400
 I think they got that wrong in Titanic.

940
00:40:12,400 --> 00:40:16,040
 I've got a real vision in Titanic of the lookout looking through a telescope.

941
00:40:16,040 --> 00:40:22,360
 So, James Cameron, take a look, maybe go back into an edit.

942
00:40:22,360 --> 00:40:23,880
 I've got a lot of darts.

943
00:40:23,880 --> 00:40:25,880
 Oh, let's talk about that.

944
00:40:25,880 --> 00:40:27,380
 Darts stuff.

945
00:40:27,380 --> 00:40:32,720
 This, the guy that you got this fact from, James, Patrick Chaplin, has a fantastic website

946
00:40:32,720 --> 00:40:38,360
 where he goes heavily into the world of darts, learned so much from him.

947
00:40:38,360 --> 00:40:43,360
 One interesting thing that he pointed out is there's a conception that darts became

948
00:40:43,360 --> 00:40:49,600
 a big game in this country when a man called Bigfoot was able to say, well, no, but this

949
00:40:49,600 --> 00:40:50,600
 is real.

950
00:40:50,600 --> 00:40:51,600
 This is a real Bigfoot.

951
00:40:51,600 --> 00:40:56,640
 But how do you find it?

952
00:40:56,640 --> 00:41:03,080
 William Bigfoot Anakin in 1908, courts in Leeds were saying that darts is gambling because

953
00:41:03,080 --> 00:41:06,800
 it's simply just throwing it as a gamble on where it's completely random where it lands.

954
00:41:06,800 --> 00:41:12,320
 And in order to prove that that wasn't the case, Bigfoot was brought into court and he

955
00:41:12,320 --> 00:41:16,520
 was asked to throw specific three double twenties, which he managed to do.

956
00:41:16,520 --> 00:41:21,000
 And in doing so, showed it was a game of skill and that meant, ah, okay, this is a sport,

957
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:23,040
 therefore you are allowed to bet on it.

958
00:41:23,040 --> 00:41:27,600
 This in the history of darting is often presented as it changed it for the whole country.

959
00:41:27,600 --> 00:41:31,160
 The seminal moment, the truth is it was more localized and it helped in a very specific

960
00:41:31,160 --> 00:41:32,160
 case.

961
00:41:32,160 --> 00:41:33,160
 In Leeds.

962
00:41:33,160 --> 00:41:34,160
 In Leeds, exactly.

963
00:41:34,160 --> 00:41:37,840
 So there, this story, we're not sure if it's true or not.

964
00:41:37,840 --> 00:41:43,720
 So William Anakin's grandson says it is true, but all the magistrate records from Leeds

965
00:41:43,720 --> 00:41:45,520
 from 1908 are missing.

966
00:41:45,520 --> 00:41:46,520
 Yeah.

967
00:41:46,520 --> 00:41:47,520
 Suspicious.

968
00:41:47,520 --> 00:41:48,520
 Suspicious.

969
00:41:48,520 --> 00:41:53,640
 They've been spotted halfway up the Himalayas actually, but it's never been confirmed whether

970
00:41:53,640 --> 00:41:54,640
 they were really...

971
00:41:54,640 --> 00:41:57,200
 There's a blurry document, but you can't quite make out the words on it.

972
00:41:57,200 --> 00:42:01,760
 The story is that they just told him what to hit and perhaps it was twenties and stuff

973
00:42:01,760 --> 00:42:05,800
 like that, but then everyone else in the court would shout out a number and then he'd have

974
00:42:05,800 --> 00:42:06,800
 to hit that.

975
00:42:06,800 --> 00:42:09,960
 So someone goes seven and then he'd hit the seven and someone shout out nine and he hit

976
00:42:09,960 --> 00:42:10,960
 the nine.

977
00:42:10,960 --> 00:42:11,960
 That's a great story.

978
00:42:11,960 --> 00:42:12,960
 I like that.

979
00:42:12,960 --> 00:42:16,040
 There was a study done about what you should aim for in darts.

980
00:42:16,040 --> 00:42:21,000
 It was done, it was published in the Royal Statistical Society Journal and basically it was saying

981
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:26,680
 you should only aim for treble twenty if you're a very skilled player because if you are not

982
00:42:26,680 --> 00:42:31,600
 a skilled player and you aim for treble twenty you'll average ten point two points per throw

983
00:42:31,600 --> 00:42:34,560
 and if you throw totally randomly you'll average twelve point eight points per throw.

984
00:42:34,560 --> 00:42:37,680
 So you'll actually do less well than average because on the either side of triple twenty

985
00:42:37,680 --> 00:42:41,360
 there's a five and a one, so you risk getting low scores.

986
00:42:41,360 --> 00:42:44,320
 But that's a very unambitious way of thinking about darts.

987
00:42:44,320 --> 00:42:48,440
 It implies that no one can ever improve from the low base and just like, unless you're

988
00:42:48,440 --> 00:42:51,600
 a natural savol, you just play for your twelve.

989
00:42:51,600 --> 00:42:56,640
 It just says why don't you try and improve on the baby slope down here with, you know,

990
00:42:56,640 --> 00:43:00,080
 the nineteen which has less dangerous numbers around it.

991
00:43:00,080 --> 00:43:04,120
 I was reading about what a sort of man sport it was, you know, women weren't allowed to

992
00:43:04,120 --> 00:43:08,800
 compete with the men in their competitions as well as there wasn't really a women's

993
00:43:08,800 --> 00:43:14,760
 body for it for a very long time and there was a big moment for women's darts and it's

994
00:43:14,760 --> 00:43:20,160
 all down to the Queen Mother because the Queen Mother went and played with the King at the

995
00:43:20,160 --> 00:43:26,520
 time a game of darts and she beat him and she was standing a foot closer to the dark

996
00:43:26,520 --> 00:43:30,760
 board but she beat him twenty one by nineteen and afterwards there were headlines around

997
00:43:30,760 --> 00:43:31,760
 the country.

998
00:43:31,760 --> 00:43:33,240
 Sorry, she beat him twenty one by nineteen.

999
00:43:33,240 --> 00:43:34,720
 They both threw three darts.

1000
00:43:34,720 --> 00:43:35,720
 I see.

1001
00:43:35,720 --> 00:43:40,840
 And this was in the thirties, we should say, in the 1930s and and so the headlines everywhere

1002
00:43:40,840 --> 00:43:44,360
 women flock to follow the Queen's lead at darts and there was this moment where it looked

1003
00:43:44,360 --> 00:43:48,520
 quite cool because it meant that women and men were playing together, different classes

1004
00:43:48,520 --> 00:43:49,520
 were playing together.

1005
00:43:49,520 --> 00:43:54,720
 It sort of transcended everything and then Bloody World War two broke out and and that

1006
00:43:54,720 --> 00:43:56,600
 sort of put a stop to things for a while.

1007
00:43:56,600 --> 00:44:00,360
 People stopped playing darts and then they forgot about this these Halcyon days of when

1008
00:44:00,360 --> 00:44:04,520
 everyone came together to play darts because I think darts playing tripled after the Queen

1009
00:44:04,520 --> 00:44:06,000
 Mother played it for a while.

1010
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:09,320
 But then but you say, you know, women didn't used to be able to compete against men.

1011
00:44:09,320 --> 00:44:11,680
 But I mean, in almost no sports can women compete against men.

1012
00:44:11,680 --> 00:44:17,240
 And actually darts is one of the very few where they can now is the most famous female

1013
00:44:17,240 --> 00:44:18,240
 darts player.

1014
00:44:18,240 --> 00:44:23,360
 Has she just won a tournament couple of years ago, she played in the world championships

1015
00:44:23,360 --> 00:44:26,880
 and she beat a couple of men and she played in the men specifically the men's.

1016
00:44:26,880 --> 00:44:29,320
 So she entered as a woman into the men's championship.

1017
00:44:29,320 --> 00:44:33,840
 And she she says she gets a lot of shit from the female league because they feel like she's

1018
00:44:33,840 --> 00:44:35,640
 not taking their league seriously.

1019
00:44:35,640 --> 00:44:38,440
 I read an interview with her recently where she said you can understand that.

1020
00:44:38,440 --> 00:44:40,720
 I think that's a complicated issue.

1021
00:44:40,720 --> 00:44:45,320
 Lisa Ashton as well from Bolton, I should mention her who's the best female darts player.

1022
00:44:45,320 --> 00:44:48,560
 One interesting thing that could happen to the darts player and this is something that

1023
00:44:48,560 --> 00:44:51,920
 has been observed in the older generations of professional darts.

1024
00:44:51,920 --> 00:44:52,920
 It's called dartitis.

1025
00:44:52,920 --> 00:44:53,920
 Yeah.

1026
00:44:53,920 --> 00:44:54,920
 That's really bad.

1027
00:44:54,920 --> 00:44:59,840
 Dartitis is a motor neurone disease without any explanation.

1028
00:44:59,840 --> 00:45:01,640
 Some people have described it as sort of the yips.

1029
00:45:01,640 --> 00:45:03,520
 You just it's the yips for that.

1030
00:45:03,520 --> 00:45:04,520
 Yeah, exactly.

1031
00:45:04,520 --> 00:45:08,560
 And you basically start throwing, but your brain won't let you let go of the dart.

1032
00:45:08,560 --> 00:45:12,680
 And you just have this kind of mental barrier that stops you from being able to throw a

1033
00:45:12,680 --> 00:45:13,680
 dart.

1034
00:45:13,680 --> 00:45:14,680
 It's terrifying.

1035
00:45:14,680 --> 00:45:18,520
 And darts players are terrified of it, I think the yips is the same as choking.

1036
00:45:18,520 --> 00:45:19,520
 Right?

1037
00:45:19,520 --> 00:45:21,060
 No, the yips is actually the same.

1038
00:45:21,060 --> 00:45:23,360
 So if you're in golf at least, this is the yips.

1039
00:45:23,360 --> 00:45:27,880
 So if you need to hit a very short putt, so the ball into the hole, your brain just won't

1040
00:45:27,880 --> 00:45:30,160
 let you push the club through the ball.

1041
00:45:30,160 --> 00:45:32,880
 You'll kind of get close to it and you'll just kind of freeze up.

1042
00:45:32,880 --> 00:45:33,880
 And yeah, it's all.

1043
00:45:33,880 --> 00:45:34,880
 And how common is this?

1044
00:45:34,880 --> 00:45:35,880
 Does this happen to people sporadically?

1045
00:45:35,880 --> 00:45:37,280
 Or is it if you've got it, you've got it?

1046
00:45:37,280 --> 00:45:38,280
 No, you can't.

1047
00:45:38,280 --> 00:45:42,720
 So Eric Bristo, who is seen, I mean, James, you know darts more, but he's basically seen

1048
00:45:42,720 --> 00:45:44,560
 as one of the greatest if not the greatest.

1049
00:45:44,560 --> 00:45:45,560
 One of the greatest.

1050
00:45:45,560 --> 00:45:46,560
 Yeah, one of the.

1051
00:45:46,560 --> 00:45:51,400
 Great for darts and he got it on his fifth world championship.

1052
00:45:51,400 --> 00:45:56,280
 So he had he had dartitis and he managed to get himself out of it and he went back to

1053
00:45:56,280 --> 00:45:57,280
 number one in the world.

1054
00:45:57,280 --> 00:45:58,280
 But he says he had it.

1055
00:45:58,280 --> 00:45:59,280
 He definitely had it.

1056
00:45:59,280 --> 00:46:00,280
 Yeah.

1057
00:46:00,280 --> 00:46:01,280
 It's amazing.

1058
00:46:01,280 --> 00:46:05,740
 Sid Waddell, who was a very famous, brilliant darts commentator, famously said of Eric Bristo.

1059
00:46:05,740 --> 00:46:10,240
 When Alexander the Great was 33, he cried salt tears because there were no more worlds

1060
00:46:10,240 --> 00:46:11,680
 to conquer.

1061
00:46:11,680 --> 00:46:19,440
 Eric Bristo is only 27.

1062
00:46:19,440 --> 00:46:27,000
 Okay, it is time for our final fact of the show.

1063
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:28,680
 And that is Andy.

1064
00:46:28,680 --> 00:46:32,440
 My fact is there is a 50 percent chance that you have a caterpillar in your mouth.

1065
00:46:32,440 --> 00:46:34,760
 What are you talking to?

1066
00:46:34,760 --> 00:46:36,600
 So it's everyone.

1067
00:46:36,600 --> 00:46:37,600
 You're not addressing.

1068
00:46:37,600 --> 00:46:41,040
 I thought you were looking at me and I thought maybe no, no, no, no, it's not it's not a judge

1069
00:46:41,040 --> 00:46:42,040
 personal judgment.

1070
00:46:42,040 --> 00:46:43,040
 Absolutely.

1071
00:46:43,040 --> 00:46:44,040
 You know, it's not a personal hygiene thing.

1072
00:46:44,040 --> 00:46:46,760
 As far as I'm aware, is that why sometimes the butterfly will eventually fly out of my

1073
00:46:46,760 --> 00:46:47,760
 mouth?

1074
00:46:47,760 --> 00:46:48,760
 That's right.

1075
00:46:48,760 --> 00:46:53,120
 So these caterpillars, they are bacterial caterpillars.

1076
00:46:53,120 --> 00:46:58,280
 So they are multicellular bacteria, which are all in the line, so they look like caterpillars.

1077
00:46:58,280 --> 00:46:59,600
 That's why they've got their name.

1078
00:46:59,600 --> 00:47:00,600
 Okay.

1079
00:47:00,600 --> 00:47:01,600
 Yeah.

1080
00:47:01,600 --> 00:47:02,600
 And this is from a trick.

1081
00:47:02,600 --> 00:47:03,600
 It's a trick.

1082
00:47:03,600 --> 00:47:07,880
 It's a brilliant website called Small Things Considered and Jennifer Fraser wrote an article

1083
00:47:07,880 --> 00:47:08,880
 about it.

1084
00:47:08,880 --> 00:47:09,880
 I read it recently.

1085
00:47:09,880 --> 00:47:13,800
 It was featured on a website called The Browser, which I read, which I love.

1086
00:47:13,800 --> 00:47:15,240
 And these are these bacterial caterpillars.

1087
00:47:15,240 --> 00:47:18,720
 They cling onto the inside of your cheek and they eat you.

1088
00:47:18,720 --> 00:47:23,000
 You are the food and they just live inside your mouth and about half of people have them.

1089
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:25,520
 And they're a family of microbes, which are so hard to pronounce.

1090
00:47:25,520 --> 00:47:26,960
 I'm going to have a go at it.

1091
00:47:26,960 --> 00:47:29,960
 It's nice, siriaceae.

1092
00:47:29,960 --> 00:47:30,960
 To see you.

1093
00:47:30,960 --> 00:47:31,960
 Nice siriaceae.

1094
00:47:31,960 --> 00:47:32,960
 Nice.

1095
00:47:32,960 --> 00:47:35,080
 There we go.

1096
00:47:35,080 --> 00:47:36,080
 Yeah.

1097
00:47:36,080 --> 00:47:43,600
 And they've evolved to live in our oral cavity or our mouth, as the common saying has it.

1098
00:47:43,600 --> 00:47:49,640
 The most famous member of the nice siriaceae family is nice siriaceae gonorrheaae.

1099
00:47:49,640 --> 00:47:53,120
 Oh, not so nice siriaceae.

1100
00:47:53,120 --> 00:47:55,360
 So gonorrheaae is part of this family of bacteria.

1101
00:47:55,360 --> 00:48:01,240
 But they named after a guy called Albert Neisser, who is a German physician.

1102
00:48:01,240 --> 00:48:05,520
 And he was the one who the gonorrhea bacteria was named after.

1103
00:48:05,520 --> 00:48:08,000
 He did discover it.

1104
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:09,720
 But yeah, it's not the greatest thing.

1105
00:48:09,720 --> 00:48:13,640
 He also co-discovered the causative agent of leprosy as well.

1106
00:48:13,640 --> 00:48:14,640
 Wow.

1107
00:48:14,640 --> 00:48:16,640
 It's called, the other guy was Hanson, I think.

1108
00:48:16,640 --> 00:48:20,120
 It's called Hanson's disease now, but he was the other guy who found that.

1109
00:48:20,120 --> 00:48:22,960
 Two really palatable and attractive things.

1110
00:48:22,960 --> 00:48:23,960
 I know.

1111
00:48:23,960 --> 00:48:27,280
 But was there ever a Mr. gonorrhea or was that part of the...

1112
00:48:27,280 --> 00:48:31,920
 Gonorrhea means something out, rhea means like shooting out like diarrhea, doesn't it?

1113
00:48:31,920 --> 00:48:35,120
 And I can't remember what gonorr means, but yeah, it means something else.

1114
00:48:35,120 --> 00:48:41,080
 But the other thing about Neisser, again, not a very nice thing, he did some quite unethical

1115
00:48:41,080 --> 00:48:46,640
 clinical trials on syphilis, putting it into patients in the 1890s.

1116
00:48:46,640 --> 00:48:52,400
 And because he did that, the universal rule regarding human experiments and the ethical

1117
00:48:52,400 --> 00:48:56,560
 rules that we have now on human experiments came in because of his experiments he did

1118
00:48:56,560 --> 00:48:57,560
 that.

1119
00:48:57,560 --> 00:48:58,560
 Really?

1120
00:48:58,560 --> 00:48:59,560
 Yeah.

1121
00:48:59,560 --> 00:49:03,160
 So we've got about, according to a study I read, 700 different species of bacteria in

1122
00:49:03,160 --> 00:49:04,160
 our mouth.

1123
00:49:04,160 --> 00:49:05,160
 Absolutely.

1124
00:49:05,160 --> 00:49:06,160
 Any given type.

1125
00:49:06,160 --> 00:49:07,160
 A caterpillar, maybe one of them.

1126
00:49:07,160 --> 00:49:09,840
 And some of them stick to their own patch of mouth.

1127
00:49:09,840 --> 00:49:13,400
 Your mouth roof bacteria will be very different to your cheek bacteria, for example.

1128
00:49:13,400 --> 00:49:14,400
 It's amazing, isn't it?

1129
00:49:14,400 --> 00:49:18,960
 And yeah, they just live on different continents within your face, it's pretty amazing.

1130
00:49:18,960 --> 00:49:25,000
 And also our mouth microbiome, our oral microbiome, is like our gut microbiome, right?

1131
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:29,040
 There's lots of talk about the gut microbiome, how everyone has their unique collection of

1132
00:49:29,040 --> 00:49:34,720
 bacteria, colony of bacteria, and that helps you digest food and your immune system, etc.

1133
00:49:34,720 --> 00:49:39,800
 But similarly in your mouth, you've got your unique oral microbiome, and it started building

1134
00:49:39,800 --> 00:49:45,000
 up basically from the moment you were born, and it doesn't change that much.

1135
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:49,880
 So you'd think when you eat kind of food with certain bacteria in it, or when you put your

1136
00:49:49,880 --> 00:49:54,240
 fingers in your mouth, or you don't wash your hands for ages, you'd think that you're

1137
00:49:54,240 --> 00:50:00,080
 introducing new colonies, but they're just fought out because basically at birth you've

1138
00:50:00,080 --> 00:50:03,880
 started forming this thing, and in fact in the womb, I found this really amazing, if

1139
00:50:03,880 --> 00:50:09,880
 your mother had gum disease, or was a smoker, you are more likely to be born with pathogens

1140
00:50:09,880 --> 00:50:12,920
 in your mouth that dispose you to cavities and stuff.

1141
00:50:12,920 --> 00:50:13,920
 It's really interesting, isn't it?

1142
00:50:13,920 --> 00:50:17,400
 They found that quite recently, because they thought that the first bacteria inside a baby

1143
00:50:17,400 --> 00:50:22,080
 would have probably come vaginally, like as they came out, basically they thought a baby

1144
00:50:22,080 --> 00:50:26,040
 would be quite sterile, but as they came out, they would pick up all of the bacteria and

1145
00:50:26,040 --> 00:50:30,920
 stuff, but it turns out that the baby's already getting bacteria from the mother's mouth,

1146
00:50:30,920 --> 00:50:35,200
 and somehow it's going from the mother's mouth down through placentally into the baby.

1147
00:50:35,200 --> 00:50:36,200
 Incredible.

1148
00:50:36,200 --> 00:50:39,920
 We're not quite sure how it happens, but because we know that the same species from one place

1149
00:50:39,920 --> 00:50:41,520
 and the other, we know that's how it's coming.

1150
00:50:41,520 --> 00:50:42,520
 That's incredible.

1151
00:50:42,520 --> 00:50:45,400
 And into the baby's mouth, because it ends up, because these are bacteria that belong

1152
00:50:45,400 --> 00:50:47,200
 in the mouth, so they find their way.

1153
00:50:47,200 --> 00:50:48,200
 How do you find it?

1154
00:50:48,200 --> 00:50:49,200
 It is incredible.

1155
00:50:49,200 --> 00:50:53,480
 The thing that you said, Dan, about how different species live in different parts of your mouth,

1156
00:50:53,480 --> 00:50:58,160
 they found that quite recently in a study where they had these fluorescent things, like

1157
00:50:58,160 --> 00:51:01,880
 little tag markers that they put on different types of bacteria.

1158
00:51:01,880 --> 00:51:06,960
 So if it was a gonorrhea bacteria, it would be blue, and if it was a stefacoccus, it'd

1159
00:51:06,960 --> 00:51:11,920
 be red or whatever, and they took them all out and then saw what they were, and they

1160
00:51:11,920 --> 00:51:14,280
 gave them different names because they saw patterns.

1161
00:51:14,280 --> 00:51:17,920
 So you would have the caterpillar in your mouth, but you might also have a hedgehog,

1162
00:51:17,920 --> 00:51:23,080
 a corn cob, or a cauliflower, and these are different types of bacterial colonies.

1163
00:51:23,080 --> 00:51:27,960
 So all four of us here, the bacteria on our tongues are more similar to each other, aren't

1164
00:51:27,960 --> 00:51:30,600
 they, than the bacteria on our own teeth?

1165
00:51:30,600 --> 00:51:31,600
 Because we make out so much.

1166
00:51:31,600 --> 00:51:32,600
 That's right.

1167
00:51:32,600 --> 00:51:33,600
 Yeah.

1168
00:51:33,600 --> 00:51:34,600
 That's exactly it.

1169
00:51:34,600 --> 00:51:37,560
 It's how we keep this vibe between us and we wrap our teeth.

1170
00:51:37,560 --> 00:51:38,560
 It's a pretty show-maker.

1171
00:51:38,560 --> 00:51:44,240
 But if you kiss someone, your tongues will be chatting to each other, but they are more

1172
00:51:44,240 --> 00:51:46,840
 similar than your own tongue will be with your gums.

1173
00:51:46,840 --> 00:51:47,840
 So romantic.

1174
00:51:47,840 --> 00:51:48,840
 Oh, you're kidding.

1175
00:51:48,840 --> 00:51:49,840
 Yeah.

1176
00:51:49,840 --> 00:51:51,840
 Maybe our tongues could chat to each other.

1177
00:51:51,840 --> 00:51:54,320
 Sounds quite French, doesn't it?

1178
00:51:54,320 --> 00:51:55,320
 Yeah.

1179
00:51:55,320 --> 00:51:56,320
 Do you know what?

1180
00:51:56,320 --> 00:51:57,320
 Eating sweets.

1181
00:51:57,320 --> 00:51:58,320
 Oh, yeah.

1182
00:51:58,320 --> 00:51:59,320
 Kids listening.

1183
00:51:59,320 --> 00:52:00,320
 And adults.

1184
00:52:00,320 --> 00:52:01,320
 That's allowed.

1185
00:52:01,320 --> 00:52:02,320
 Yeah.

1186
00:52:02,320 --> 00:52:03,320
 And adults, yeah.

1187
00:52:03,320 --> 00:52:04,320
 So I'll patch kids, Andy.

1188
00:52:04,320 --> 00:52:05,320
 Love 'em.

1189
00:52:05,320 --> 00:52:08,000
 But as an adult, you can eat whatever sweets you like, whereas as a kid, your parents often

1190
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:09,840
 say, "Don't, you'll get holes in your teeth."

1191
00:52:09,840 --> 00:52:10,840
 Yeah.

1192
00:52:10,840 --> 00:52:11,840
 It doesn't cause cavities.

1193
00:52:11,840 --> 00:52:12,840
 What?

1194
00:52:12,840 --> 00:52:13,840
 Are you sure?

1195
00:52:13,840 --> 00:52:14,840
 Yeah.

1196
00:52:14,840 --> 00:52:15,840
 Well.

1197
00:52:15,840 --> 00:52:17,840
 I have to count this.

1198
00:52:17,840 --> 00:52:20,200
 Wait, wait for the backtrack.

1199
00:52:20,200 --> 00:52:26,020
 So basically, the way the cavities are formed are when bacteria living in our mouth digest

1200
00:52:26,020 --> 00:52:32,080
 things that we eat, and then when they digest them, they excrete acidity, makes them very

1201
00:52:32,080 --> 00:52:36,440
 acidic, and it's the acidity which rots away at your teeth.

1202
00:52:36,440 --> 00:52:44,360
 And some bacteria do like carbohydrates, but they don't prefer a sweet to an apple or

1203
00:52:44,360 --> 00:52:45,360
 some grain.

1204
00:52:45,360 --> 00:52:50,560
 I don't think there's a connection between eating loads of quality street or whatever.

1205
00:52:50,560 --> 00:52:59,080
 But it is true that children are likely to snack on sweets, then some grain, as in...

1206
00:52:59,080 --> 00:53:01,200
 I'm sure you were very popular in the playground, Anna.

1207
00:53:01,200 --> 00:53:02,400
 Anna's there at the pick-and-mix.

1208
00:53:02,400 --> 00:53:05,600
 Oh, you know, maybe some book wheat would be nice.

1209
00:53:05,600 --> 00:53:09,080
 I was a very advanced child.

1210
00:53:09,080 --> 00:53:10,080
 Yeah.

1211
00:53:10,080 --> 00:53:11,280
 Look, that's a good point.

1212
00:53:11,280 --> 00:53:16,760
 But I think also the problem is that if you were to eat, like, let's say peanuts or bread

1213
00:53:16,760 --> 00:53:21,280
 or something, that's more like to get stuck in your teeth, whereas the sugar tends to just

1214
00:53:21,280 --> 00:53:22,280
 disappear away.

1215
00:53:22,280 --> 00:53:23,280
 Just a doll, doesn't it?

1216
00:53:23,280 --> 00:53:24,280
 It goes on your throat.

1217
00:53:24,280 --> 00:53:26,280
 So it would be quite a good advertising campaign to say, you know, if people are trying to

1218
00:53:26,280 --> 00:53:30,200
 not get cavities in their teeth, bacteria are trying to have a poo in your mouth and

1219
00:53:30,200 --> 00:53:32,760
 don't let them, you know, only let them do it at mealtimes.

1220
00:53:32,760 --> 00:53:33,760
 Yeah, that's nice.

1221
00:53:33,760 --> 00:53:34,760
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1222
00:53:34,760 --> 00:53:35,760
 Yeah.

1223
00:53:35,760 --> 00:53:36,760
 That would be a motivational postcard.

1224
00:53:36,760 --> 00:53:37,760
 Maybe a character.

1225
00:53:37,760 --> 00:53:39,280
 You'd have like a bacterial character.

1226
00:53:39,280 --> 00:53:40,280
 Yeah.

1227
00:53:40,280 --> 00:53:41,280
 Yeah.

1228
00:53:41,280 --> 00:53:45,280
 Goes into schools, you know, a giant bacteria does a poo on the floor.

1229
00:53:45,280 --> 00:53:48,280
 Don't let me do this in your mouth.

1230
00:53:48,280 --> 00:53:51,080
 And then it burns a hole in the floor.

1231
00:53:51,080 --> 00:53:52,080
 Yeah.

1232
00:53:52,080 --> 00:53:56,400
 I think this could be a good spinoff business for us.

1233
00:53:56,400 --> 00:54:03,280
 I had a half my tooth fell out the other night in bed and I stopped shooting on the bed post.

1234
00:54:03,280 --> 00:54:04,280
 Just so you know that.

1235
00:54:04,280 --> 00:54:05,280
 That's the side.

1236
00:54:05,280 --> 00:54:06,280
 The end is very dear.

1237
00:54:06,280 --> 00:54:07,280
 I know.

1238
00:54:07,280 --> 00:54:08,280
 I know.

1239
00:54:08,280 --> 00:54:11,280
 I'm going to be a 38 year old man and my son, five years old, did our reaction because

1240
00:54:11,280 --> 00:54:12,720
 I went, oh my God, I'm crumbling.

1241
00:54:12,720 --> 00:54:13,720
 This is it.

1242
00:54:13,720 --> 00:54:15,360
 My son, grab me, went, dad, you're so lucky.

1243
00:54:15,360 --> 00:54:19,480
 Put that under the pillow and you're going to make tons of money by the morning.

1244
00:54:19,480 --> 00:54:22,280
 But yeah, it just disappeared and I've been eating a lot of sweets because Halloween,

1245
00:54:22,280 --> 00:54:24,680
 we got a huge hoard off the back of the trick of treating that we did.

1246
00:54:24,680 --> 00:54:27,400
 I think there's a correlation causation thing here.

1247
00:54:27,400 --> 00:54:28,400
 Yeah.

1248
00:54:28,400 --> 00:54:29,400
 Must be right.

1249
00:54:29,400 --> 00:54:30,400
 So half your tooth fell out.

1250
00:54:30,400 --> 00:54:31,400
 Yeah, just fell out.

1251
00:54:31,400 --> 00:54:32,400
 Yeah.

1252
00:54:32,400 --> 00:54:33,400
 So you've only got half a tooth now.

1253
00:54:33,400 --> 00:54:34,400
 Yeah, it's still the breast.

1254
00:54:34,400 --> 00:54:35,400
 Are you serious?

1255
00:54:35,400 --> 00:54:36,400
 Yeah, I'm not joking.

1256
00:54:36,400 --> 00:54:37,400
 I feel like you're overly concerned here, Andy.

1257
00:54:37,400 --> 00:54:38,400
 I feel like Dan needs quite urgent attention.

1258
00:54:38,400 --> 00:54:39,400
 I feel like you're utterly concerned.

1259
00:54:39,400 --> 00:54:48,520
 I have to say, because I've only got half a tooth at the back of my mouth because of

1260
00:54:48,520 --> 00:54:51,800
 some dental work that I never got finished because it was coming too expensive and I

1261
00:54:51,800 --> 00:54:56,120
 said to the dentist, it's only the back half of my tooth that I have for all the roots

1262
00:54:56,120 --> 00:54:57,120
 are a little bit exposed.

1263
00:54:57,120 --> 00:55:00,880
 And I said, if hypothetically I didn't come back and pay for you to put the crown on top

1264
00:55:00,880 --> 00:55:02,880
 of this, would it be bad?

1265
00:55:02,880 --> 00:55:06,440
 And the dentist said to me, look, if you were an 85 year old woman, I'd say it doesn't

1266
00:55:06,440 --> 00:55:07,440
 matter.

1267
00:55:07,440 --> 00:55:11,640
 But for a younger person, you probably want that tooth at some point in your life.

1268
00:55:11,640 --> 00:55:15,880
 So if you do feel like the end is nigh, it's probably not worth getting it done.

1269
00:55:15,880 --> 00:55:16,880
 Yeah.

1270
00:55:16,880 --> 00:55:17,880
 So that's something to reassure you.

1271
00:55:17,880 --> 00:55:18,880
 You're saying I should leave it?

1272
00:55:18,880 --> 00:55:19,880
 Leave it.

1273
00:55:19,880 --> 00:55:25,120
 I mean, Anna, that's like, I remember when I was younger, being in a cab and not having

1274
00:55:25,120 --> 00:55:28,360
 much money and saying, and just, you know, you say to the cabbie, can you let me off

1275
00:55:28,360 --> 00:55:29,360
 here?

1276
00:55:29,360 --> 00:55:30,360
 This is great.

1277
00:55:30,360 --> 00:55:31,360
 You're a mile short of your destination.

1278
00:55:31,360 --> 00:55:32,360
 Yeah.

1279
00:55:32,360 --> 00:55:33,360
 It takes up the cash you got.

1280
00:55:33,360 --> 00:55:34,360
 That's what I've done.

1281
00:55:34,360 --> 00:55:37,840
 I've done an infected wisdom tooth at the moment, while I've taken antibiotics, it's

1282
00:55:37,840 --> 00:55:39,040
 just about getting better.

1283
00:55:39,040 --> 00:55:42,360
 But I'm thinking the way that Andy's looking at all three of us at the moment, I think

1284
00:55:42,360 --> 00:55:47,360
 our make-out sessions might not be happening anymore.

1285
00:55:47,360 --> 00:55:51,800
 Okay, that's it.

1286
00:55:51,800 --> 00:55:52,800
 That's all of our facts.

1287
00:55:52,800 --> 00:55:53,800
