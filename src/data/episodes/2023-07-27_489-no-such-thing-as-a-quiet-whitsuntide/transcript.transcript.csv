00:00:00,00:00:07,"Hi everyone, welcome to this week's episode of No Such Things as a Fish, where we were joined in the Soho Theatre London by the"
00:00:07,00:00:10,incredible Sally Phillips.
00:00:10,00:00:18,"Now a lot of you will be excited by that, I'm sure because Sally has been on the podcast a couple of times now and she is so funny."
00:00:18,00:00:22,She is just one of us really. She loves doing the research. She loves facts.
00:00:22,00:00:27,"Just for anyone who doesn't know who Sally is, she is basically the doyen of"
00:00:28,00:00:35,"British comedy over the last however many years. She was in Smack the Pony, she was in Alan Partridge,"
00:00:35,00:00:38,she played the Prime Minister of Finland in Veep.
00:00:38,00:00:43,"I mean, she's been in everything. You know who Sally Phillips is. You're really going to enjoy this show."
00:00:43,00:00:48,"I don't really have much more to say, so I might as well quickly say don't forget to join Club Fish."
00:00:48,00:00:54,"If you want to, go to notionsthingasofish.com/patreon or notionsthingasofish.com/apple if you want to do that."
00:00:54,00:00:59,"Loads of bonus material, ad-free episodes, all sorts of stuff on there. A few weeks ago,"
00:00:59,00:01:02,"we gave away a cabbage patch doll and actually that reminds me,"
00:01:02,00:01:07,"once you've listened to this show, do go on to our various social medias because you will be able to see"
00:01:07,00:01:15,"a couple of props that were used in this show. I'm sure we'll post them up, so definitely go and check those out because they're absolutely brilliant."
00:01:15,00:01:20,"Look, I don't want to use up any more of your time. I'm just going to say on with the podcast!"
00:01:20,00:01:37,[Music]
00:01:37,00:01:39,"Oh, nice!"
00:01:39,00:01:49,"Hello and welcome to another episode and no such thing as a fish, a weekly podcast this week!"
00:01:50,00:01:53,Coming to you live from Soho Theatre!
00:01:53,00:02:02,"My name is Dan Schreiber. I am sitting here with James Harkin, Andrew Hunter Murray and Sally Phillips."
00:02:02,00:02:10,"And once again, we have gathered around the microphones with our four favorite facts from the last seven days and in no particular order, here we go."
00:02:10,00:02:13,"Starting with fact number one, and that is Sally."
00:02:13,00:02:24,"So, I was entranced by the Finnish Hobby Horse Championships that was doing the round on Twitter and also I was in Finland when they were being held, unfortunately didn't make it."
00:02:24,00:02:35,But my fact is that the world's best hobby horse jumper can jump high enough to theoretically clear the first two jumps in the Grand National.
00:02:38,00:02:46,"It's amazing how many of you saw it. It was really amazing. The Hobby Horse Championships, it's mainly girls between 11 and 18 there."
00:02:46,00:02:48,"Okay, and is it one?"
00:02:48,00:02:49,You can't afford a wheel horse.
00:02:49,00:02:51,"It's on BBC One, like where are they?"
00:02:51,00:02:58,"The girls are horribly bullied by their compatriots for being into, yeah, there was a film called Hobby Horse Revolution."
00:02:58,00:03:08,"2019. It's a big thing, it's like once you look into it, and it is some boys but mainly girls and some adult women,"
00:03:08,00:03:13,but I think that's a bit strange. They often go into Woodland and do it in secret.
00:03:13,00:03:17,So they don't give away their moves or?
00:03:17,00:03:20,"No, so they don't get attacked."
00:03:20,00:03:31,"And they start off, most people make their own hobby horses because a pro hobby horse costs about 300 euros."
00:03:31,00:03:34,And the bridle is...
00:03:34,00:03:36,We're talking about the stick with the head of the horse.
00:03:36,00:03:40,"Yeah, so it's the realism that's the expansiveness, is it?"
00:03:40,00:03:43,"Or are they like, is it like Nimbus 2000."
00:03:43,00:03:50,"I don't know, I don't know, but my partner and I, because we knew this was live and we love the show very much,"
00:03:50,00:03:55,this afternoon spent a full 15 minutes each making everyone a hobby horse.
00:03:55,00:03:55,What?
00:03:55,00:03:56,No way.
00:03:56,00:03:58,What?
00:03:58,00:04:03,Oh my God.
00:04:03,00:04:05,What?
00:04:05,00:04:14,"So Andy, for the people who can't see this, for the people who can't see this, bad luck because it's indescribable."
00:04:14,00:04:14,It is incredible.
00:04:14,00:04:15,This is amazing.
00:04:15,00:04:19,"Yours does look a tiny bit like a bad date night, girls."
00:04:19,00:04:27,"Mine is, it's a very colourful sock, which is stuffed and it has a mop hair and some eyes."
00:04:27,00:04:28,"And yeah, I love it."
00:04:28,00:04:29,And yours?
00:04:29,00:04:29,Thank you so much.
00:04:29,00:04:33,"Mine is ultra realistic, I would say. This is a horse."
00:04:34,00:04:37,"Yeah, mine slightly looks like he ran out of materials and gave up."
00:04:37,00:04:41,"Yours is very cool, it's very kind of like space horse."
00:04:41,00:04:48,"Mine's very space, like a glam rock, sort of, this hair is like very, let's zeppelin for the year three."
00:04:48,00:04:51,"I'd say I did that one, I'm quite pleased with that one."
00:04:51,00:04:56,"And this one's made out of bandages, a planta and it's got radishes for eyes."
00:04:56,00:05:00,"Oh wow, this is incredible, this is incredible."
00:05:00,00:05:06,"Well, I thought, I mean, I kind of thought we could maybe have a go, but that would be too embarrassing, wouldn't it?"
00:05:06,00:05:08,"Well, maybe we should get the audience to have a go, do a bit of dressage."
00:05:08,00:05:13,Because what would happen is there would be loads of different disciplines.
00:05:13,00:05:17,"Everyone's putting it down, don't make me do it, don't make me do it."
00:05:17,00:05:19,"I'm a geek, I don't like physical action."
00:05:19,00:05:22,"Yeah, they do show jumping, they do puissance,"
00:05:22,00:05:28,"which is the only time you're allowed to run at a jump with, you're allowed to run at it rather than canter."
00:05:29,00:05:34,"And yeah, that is the one where they've jumped a whole Peter Dinklage."
00:05:34,00:05:36,"Oh, is that how tall Peter is?"
00:05:36,00:05:39,"Four foot seven inches, four foot seven inches."
00:05:39,00:05:43,"But there's also, you know, show jumping, they do,"
00:05:43,00:05:45,"the international is 80 centimetres, the jumps."
00:05:45,00:05:50,"But the fins so dominate that their jumps are one metre, 10 centimetres."
00:05:50,00:05:51,Wow.
00:05:51,00:05:55,"So 10,000 hobby horses in Finland, in Finland alone."
00:05:55,00:05:55,That's incredible.
00:05:55,00:05:58,"But it's spreading, it's a reason I don't know."
00:05:58,00:06:01,But is there a reason it hasn't got further or that it's so finished?
00:06:01,00:06:03,It's got quite far.
00:06:03,00:06:03,"Right, okay."
00:06:03,00:06:06,"It has actually got quite, it's got so much further than you'd think."
00:06:06,00:06:11,"All the Nordic nations, Canada, Ukraine."
00:06:11,00:06:12,"Yeah, yeah, it's in so many places, but sometimes it's..."
00:06:12,00:06:14,"It's quite northern, isn't it?"
00:06:14,00:06:17,"It's quite a north, northern Europe and Canada,"
00:06:17,00:06:20,"like places where you have long, dark nights with not much else to do."
00:06:20,00:06:21,"Yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:06:21,00:06:23,"Well, you say that, you say that."
00:06:23,00:06:29,"But I mean, at least they're nice to the horses in the Nordic nations,"
00:06:29,00:06:33,"whereas our pretend horses have a dark, dark history."
00:06:33,00:06:34,Right.
00:06:34,00:06:35,I'm talking about the...
00:06:35,00:06:38,"None of you came across that, the Padstow, Obi-Wanstow."
00:06:38,00:06:39,"Oh, the Obi-Wanstow."
00:06:39,00:06:42,"Yeah, but the scariest one is in Wales."
00:06:42,00:06:46,"In Wales, they use real horse skulls on a stick."
00:06:46,00:06:47,Really?
00:06:47,00:06:47,"Yeah, we're..."
00:06:47,00:06:50,"This isn't teenage girls doing it, though, is it?"
00:06:50,00:06:52,"Well, the video I saw..."
00:06:52,00:06:53,It's like ghost horse.
00:06:53,00:06:56,"Elderly man, go with some friends,"
00:06:56,00:07:00,"goes to the door of someone's house,"
00:07:00,00:07:04,and then sings quite a scary song in Welsh.
00:07:04,00:07:07,"And if you cannot finish the song inside the house,"
00:07:07,00:07:09,they force their way in.
00:07:09,00:07:09,Okay.
00:07:09,00:07:12,And there's a lot of chasing girls with horses and...
00:07:12,00:07:14,"It's all sort of strange folky rituals, isn't it?"
00:07:14,00:07:16,"Very strange folky rituals, yeah."
00:07:16,00:07:18,But there are loads of these rituals all over the place.
00:07:18,00:07:18,"Yeah, it's all over the place."
00:07:18,00:07:19,"Okay, there's the..."
00:07:19,00:07:21,"You said Padstow, which is another one."
00:07:21,00:07:23,There's the Hoden horse in Ken.
00:07:23,00:07:24,Did you see the Padstow?
00:07:24,00:07:25,Did you look at that online?
00:07:25,00:07:26,"Yeah, I did."
00:07:26,00:07:26,It doesn't look...
00:07:26,00:07:27,"I mean, it's really bizarre."
00:07:27,00:07:29,It looks like a grand piano.
00:07:29,00:07:30,"Oh, really?"
00:07:30,00:07:32,"But with a tail and things sticking out the front,"
00:07:32,00:07:33,then they sort of rock it.
00:07:33,00:07:34,"Yeah, they're kind of a bit rich."
00:07:34,00:07:35,Very strange.
00:07:35,00:07:38,Is this where the pantomime horse comes from?
00:07:38,00:07:39,No.
00:07:39,00:07:41,"Because these are really weird sort of ritual,"
00:07:41,00:07:43,"fertility things, but it's nothing to do with the pantomime."
00:07:43,00:07:44,"No, nothing to do with the pantomime horse."
00:07:44,00:07:45,Maybe a bit.
00:07:45,00:07:46,"Well, no, it's really strange."
00:07:46,00:07:48,It's the Lord of Misrules.
00:07:48,00:07:50,So it's the spirit of...
00:07:50,00:07:51,"Well, that's what Google told me."
00:07:51,00:07:53,"Well, what is it?"
00:07:53,00:07:54,I'm talking like I've got...
00:07:54,00:07:55,What is the pantomime horse?
00:07:55,00:07:57,"But a kind of, you know, that's a sort of misrule thing,"
00:07:57,00:07:58,isn't it?
00:07:58,00:07:59,"You know, it's unnatural."
00:07:59,00:07:59,The pantomime horse.
00:07:59,00:08:00,It's weird.
00:08:00,00:08:01,"Yes, so..."
00:08:01,00:08:03,Who's in the front? Who's in the back?
00:08:03,00:08:03,Yeah.
00:08:03,00:08:04,No?
00:08:04,00:08:04,No one...
00:08:04,00:08:05,"Yeah, I always feel that's the..."
00:08:05,00:08:08,You would get on really well with Kate Beckinsale.
00:08:08,00:08:08,Did you see this?
00:08:08,00:08:09,"Oh, really?"
00:08:09,00:08:11,She travels with the pantomime horse everywhere.
00:08:11,00:08:11,She does.
00:08:11,00:08:12,Yeah.
00:08:12,00:08:14,And she reckons it's like really good.
00:08:14,00:08:16,"Well, it kind of calms her down as she's stressed."
00:08:16,00:08:18,"Wait, sorry, with people in it?"
00:08:18,00:08:20,"Well, does she...?"
00:08:20,00:08:24,Like an emotional support animal.
00:08:24,00:08:26,"She brings the costume around,"
00:08:26,00:08:28,"and then if she's got a bit of downtime,"
00:08:28,00:08:30,then she'll get in it and she'll find someone else
00:08:30,00:08:31,to get in it with her.
00:08:31,00:08:34,"And it's just a nice way of calming down, relaxing and..."
00:08:34,00:08:38,"Yes, very normal."
00:08:38,00:08:40,I think the biggest problem on the sort of a PR level
00:08:40,00:08:42,"is that no matter how you try and spin it,"
00:08:42,00:08:44,it always sounds nuts when you say the thing
00:08:44,00:08:46,you're actually doing with hobby horsing.
00:08:46,00:08:48,"Like, I found a quote from someone who said,"
00:08:48,00:08:50,"""People assume that it's a game"
00:08:50,00:08:53,"or that we are more or less crazy,"""
00:08:53,00:08:58,said Chairwoman of the Finnish Stick Horse Enthusiast Association.
00:08:58,00:09:01,"You're never going to make it past the description, are you?"
00:09:01,00:09:02,It's a hard thing.
00:09:02,00:09:04,But it sounds like an amazing...
00:09:04,00:09:06,"I genuinely think, you know, people always talk about"
00:09:06,00:09:08,"at the Olympics, like, why not have someone in the 100 meters"
00:09:08,00:09:11,who's just a citizen who's just running alongside
00:09:11,00:09:13,"and you can really see how fast they're going,"
00:09:13,00:09:15,"having a 12-year-old girl at the Grand National,"
00:09:15,00:09:18,make the first two and just stack it
00:09:18,00:09:20,head first until the third.
00:09:20,00:09:21,That would be amazing.
00:09:21,00:09:24,"Actually, imagine you had a pantomime horse,"
00:09:24,00:09:27,the fastest pantomime horse in the world.
00:09:27,00:09:28,Yeah.
00:09:28,00:09:30,And they are in the 100 meters.
00:09:30,00:09:32,"You know it's a person, right?"
00:09:32,00:09:35,"Well, two people, and they're in the 100 meters"
00:09:35,00:09:37,in the first-ever Olympics.
00:09:37,00:09:38,Yeah.
00:09:38,00:09:39,Where do you think they would finish?
00:09:39,00:09:41,"So, in the first ever..."
00:09:41,00:09:43,"The first-ever Olympics 100 meters race,"
00:09:43,00:09:46,you've got the two fastest current pantomime horse people.
00:09:46,00:09:47,Yeah.
00:09:47,00:09:49,Where would they finish in the race?
00:09:49,00:09:51,"Because people did run a bit slower, didn't they,"
00:09:51,00:09:52,in the first Olympics?
00:09:52,00:09:55,"Yeah, but they didn't have a pantomime horse costume on."
00:09:55,00:09:56,Why? I just...
00:09:56,00:09:58,"Well, the first Olympics, that was Greece."
00:09:58,00:10:00,"It was just, like, ancient Greece."
00:10:00,00:10:02,"Oh, no, sorry, in 1996."
00:10:02,00:10:03,The first modern Olympics.
00:10:03,00:10:04,"Right, first modern."
00:10:04,00:10:06,"Just shoes were less good then, and they hadn't..."
00:10:06,00:10:07,You know...
00:10:07,00:10:09,Maybe someone died in the right race.
00:10:09,00:10:10,"Oh, OK."
00:10:10,00:10:13,"Honestly, it's just a straight-up question."
00:10:13,00:10:14,I'm going to say bronze.
00:10:14,00:10:15,I'm going to say bronze.
00:10:15,00:10:17,"But, no, no, I'm going to say silver and bronze,"
00:10:17,00:10:19,because they count as two people.
00:10:19,00:10:20,Very clever. Very clever.
00:10:20,00:10:21,Yeah.
00:10:21,00:10:23,I'm going to say gold.
00:10:23,00:10:24,"No, well, Dan is right."
00:10:24,00:10:25,They would have got silver.
00:10:25,00:10:30,"The fastest is 12.045 seconds for 100 meters,"
00:10:30,00:10:33,"and that wouldn't quite have gotten gold in the first Olympics,"
00:10:33,00:10:34,but it would have been the second place.
00:10:34,00:10:38,Does the nose of the person in the back of the pantomime horse
00:10:38,00:10:39,have to get over the line?
00:10:39,00:10:40,"No, no, OK."
00:10:40,00:10:41,OK.
00:10:41,00:10:42,Just the front.
00:10:42,00:10:43,That's amazing.
00:10:43,00:10:44,"Can I go back to hobby-horsing,"
00:10:44,00:10:46,just because it's one fact I'm just so desperate to share?
00:10:46,00:10:47,Yeah.
00:10:47,00:10:50,One of the rules of the hobby-horse competition
00:10:50,00:10:53,is that only stallions and mares can take part
00:10:53,00:10:55,and geldings are banned.
00:10:55,00:11:00,Gelding.
00:11:00,00:11:01,Gelding being a...
00:11:01,00:11:02,What have you made of that?
00:11:02,00:11:03,A muted young horse.
00:11:03,00:11:04,Where are the testicles on this thing?
00:11:04,00:11:06,"Well, that's what I mean."
00:11:06,00:11:07,They're all geldings.
00:11:07,00:11:08,That's what I mean.
00:11:08,00:11:09,"Yeah, well, exactly."
00:11:09,00:11:10,"That's bizarre, isn't it?"
00:11:10,00:11:11,But that's in the rules.
00:11:11,00:11:12,That's amazing.
00:11:12,00:11:13,Incredible.
00:11:13,00:11:14,Pantomime horses.
00:11:14,00:11:15,"I mean, that is the worst ever job."
00:11:15,00:11:16,Have you ever done that?
00:11:16,00:11:17,"No, I've never done that."
00:11:17,00:11:18,I've never done that.
00:11:18,00:11:19,I've never done that.
00:11:19,00:11:22,There were some pantomimes that sometimes used real horses.
00:11:22,00:11:23,Right.
00:11:23,00:11:27,Because John Barrowman was thrown 20 foot off by one.
00:11:27,00:11:30,"They supposedly trained horses, they threw him off."
00:11:30,00:11:32,In Glasgow in 2013.
00:11:32,00:11:33,And there was a...
00:11:33,00:11:35,Paul O'Grady always used to tell a story
00:11:35,00:11:37,about being in a panto with a trained horse
00:11:37,00:11:39,that he had to get into bed with him.
00:11:39,00:11:40,He used to follow him around.
00:11:40,00:11:42,He was playing the fairy godmother in Cinderella.
00:11:42,00:11:46,He used to follow him around the stage with a massive erection.
00:11:46,00:11:49,And he couldn't...
00:11:49,00:11:53,He couldn't say anything because there was loads and loads of kids.
00:11:53,00:11:56,"And they're all going, ""It's behind you!"""
00:11:56,00:12:00,"Oh, wow."
00:12:00,00:12:01,Good grief.
00:12:01,00:12:02,That's pretty good.
00:12:02,00:12:04,Here's the thing about real horses now.
00:12:04,00:12:05,Yeah.
00:12:05,00:12:06,If you...
00:12:06,00:12:07,I don't think we've said this before.
00:12:07,00:12:13,"If you frown at a horse and then go away and then come back,"
00:12:13,00:12:19,it will remember and be a bit more...
00:12:19,00:12:23,James is doing some stunt work for the people listening at home.
00:12:23,00:12:25,It'll remember that you frown at home.
00:12:25,00:12:26,It'll remember that you frown at home.
00:12:26,00:12:28,"But also if you smile at a horse and then go away,"
00:12:28,00:12:30,"it will think, ""Oh, there he is."""
00:12:30,00:12:32,The horse remembers you frowned.
00:12:32,00:12:34,How is it then passing that data on?
00:12:34,00:12:35,Exactly.
00:12:35,00:12:36,So it's bizarre.
00:12:36,00:12:38,It's which eye it looks at you with.
00:12:38,00:12:39,Oh.
00:12:39,00:12:42,So horses look at negative or threatening sites with their left eye
00:12:42,00:12:44,and positive ones with their right eye.
00:12:44,00:12:45,Really?
00:12:45,00:12:47,"So if you come back, you know what the horse thinks of you,"
00:12:47,00:12:49,depending on which eye it looks at you with.
00:12:49,00:12:50,That's really interesting.
00:12:50,00:12:53,So horses understand human facial expressions.
00:12:53,00:12:54,Yeah.
00:12:54,00:12:56,"It's interesting because a lot of animals, if you smile at them,"
00:12:56,00:12:59,"they'll see the teeth and they think you're being aggressive,"
00:12:59,00:13:00,for instance.
00:13:00,00:13:01,Right.
00:13:01,00:13:02,So interesting.
00:13:02,00:13:03,Yeah.
00:13:03,00:13:07,Yeah.
00:13:07,00:13:10,Do you know that it was illegal to dress up as a horse in Scotland
00:13:10,00:13:12,in the 7th century?
00:13:12,00:13:13,Really?
00:13:13,00:13:14,Yeah.
00:13:14,00:13:18,"In fact, it was forbidden for any man to dress as a horse"
00:13:18,00:13:23,or a wild beast and dance anti-clockwise during January.
00:13:23,00:13:24,Yeah.
00:13:24,00:13:25,It was demonic.
00:13:25,00:13:28,"Well, that's the thing about dressing up as an animal"
00:13:28,00:13:31,was to let your demonic side out.
00:13:31,00:13:32,Yeah.
00:13:32,00:13:33,"Yeah, absolutely."
00:13:33,00:13:35,It was seen as very anti-Catholic and stuff.
00:13:35,00:13:39,St Augustine wrote that anyone carrying on that most filthy
00:13:39,00:13:43,practice of dressing like a horse should be punished most severely.
00:13:43,00:13:44,"Oh, wow."
00:13:44,00:13:48,"But as soon as the 1st of February hits, knock yourself out."
00:13:48,00:13:52,We're doing No Horse January this year again.
00:13:52,00:13:53,That's fine.
00:13:59,00:14:02,"OK, it is time for fact number two."
00:14:02,00:14:03,And that is my fact.
00:14:03,00:14:08,"My fact this week is that this June of 2023, the 6 millionth,"
00:14:08,00:14:16,"666,666 English language Wikipedia article was created."
00:14:16,00:14:19,And that page was an entry for SatanCon.
00:14:19,00:14:20,Ooh.
00:14:20,00:14:21,Yeah.
00:14:21,00:14:25,"You've got to imagine, obviously, that they were aiming to land that."
00:14:25,00:14:26,"But that's really hard, right?"
00:14:26,00:14:28,So SatanCon being--
00:14:28,00:14:30,Is that like Comic-Con but with devils?
00:14:30,00:14:31,It pretty much is.
00:14:31,00:14:35,"Yeah, it's set up by the Satanic Temple, who are a non-theistic"
00:14:35,00:14:38,"organization, and they have this annual convention."
00:14:38,00:14:39,It was in Boston this year.
00:14:39,00:14:41,"It was on April 28th, which is my birthday."
00:14:41,00:14:43,So that's very exciting.
00:14:43,00:14:44,Congratulations.
00:14:44,00:14:45,Thank you very much.
00:14:45,00:14:47,"It's quite new, SatanCon."
00:14:47,00:14:49,"I think it's only been held twice, I think."
00:14:49,00:14:53,So this year was in Boston at the Boston Marriott Hotel.
00:14:53,00:14:56,"So good on the Marriott, because you would think,"
00:14:56,00:15:00,"oh, maybe there'll be a reputational concern if we host SatanCon."
00:15:00,00:15:02,"But they said, no, you come and have the conference here."
00:15:02,00:15:04,And I think that's really good.
00:15:04,00:15:07,"Because, no, but the first one got lots of placards"
00:15:07,00:15:10,"and it got lots of protests outside SatanCon 1,"
00:15:10,00:15:13,"you know, in 2022, denouncing Satan and this sort of thing."
00:15:13,00:15:17,"Even though the Satanic Temple, they don't believe in Satan."
00:15:17,00:15:18,They don't--
00:15:18,00:15:19,They say they lie.
00:15:19,00:15:20,That's the point.
00:15:20,00:15:22,That is the point of Satan.
00:15:22,00:15:23,"Yeah, really good point."
00:15:23,00:15:24,Yeah.
00:15:24,00:15:25,"Oh, that's worry."
00:15:25,00:15:28,Because they do run Satan Afterschool Clubs.
00:15:28,00:15:32,And I was thinking of my kids.
00:15:32,00:15:34,And even if they--
00:15:34,00:15:36,"Even if they don't believe in Satan,"
00:15:36,00:15:38,they're not helping themselves by calling themselves
00:15:38,00:15:39,"the Satanic Temple, are they?"
00:15:39,00:15:40,No.
00:15:40,00:15:43,"They're sort of more of a free speech organization, really."
00:15:43,00:15:44,"That's what they say, Andy."
00:15:44,00:15:45,"But no, you're right."
00:15:45,00:15:46,It's all such a good point.
00:15:46,00:15:47,You're being sucked in.
00:15:47,00:15:48,"Oh, God, I've fallen right for it."
00:15:48,00:15:50,"Satan Prince of Lies, that's his name."
00:15:50,00:15:53,Why did I get this pentagram tattooed on my back?
00:15:53,00:15:56,[LAUGHTER]
00:15:56,00:16:00,"They use the proper Latin greeting instead of saying Hail Satan,"
00:16:00,00:16:01,who they don't believe in.
00:16:01,00:16:03,I'm really on the temple side.
00:16:03,00:16:05,They say Ave Satana.
00:16:05,00:16:06,What's that mean?
00:16:06,00:16:07,Hail Satan.
00:16:07,00:16:08,Hail Satan.
00:16:08,00:16:14,[LAUGHTER]
00:16:14,00:16:15,Yeah.
00:16:15,00:16:18,"But it scans the same as have a banana, which I really like."
00:16:18,00:16:19,Ave Satana.
00:16:19,00:16:20,That's how you can remember it.
00:16:20,00:16:21,"Yeah, yeah."
00:16:21,00:16:22,I like it.
00:16:22,00:16:23,I think they're good.
00:16:23,00:16:24,"Oh, do you?"
00:16:24,00:16:25,"Yeah, they're kind of rationalistic."
00:16:25,00:16:27,"Well, there's a few of them around down there who claim to not be"
00:16:27,00:16:30,"interested in Satan, but are called the Church of Satan or whatever."
00:16:30,00:16:31,Yeah.
00:16:31,00:16:32,Yeah.
00:16:32,00:16:34,And a lot of them are like just trying to take the piss out
00:16:34,00:16:37,"of the government, out of the church, out of all that kind of stuff."
00:16:37,00:16:38,Yeah.
00:16:38,00:16:41,"In lockdown, I started presenting a religious program"
00:16:41,00:16:44,on Sunday mornings called Sunday Morning Live.
00:16:44,00:16:48,"And we, under the BBC, had to interview every religion"
00:16:48,00:16:49,that's recognized as a religion.
00:16:49,00:16:50,Oh.
00:16:50,00:16:53,"I didn't actually do it, but they interviewed the Satanists."
00:16:53,00:16:54,Really?
00:16:54,00:16:55,After--
00:16:55,00:16:56,Oh.
00:16:56,00:16:58,Is that like a proper religion then in the UK?
00:16:58,00:16:59,Yeah.
00:16:59,00:17:00,All right.
00:17:00,00:17:01,"Yeah, Wiccan."
00:17:01,00:17:02,"Wiccan, yeah."
00:17:02,00:17:04,"And the lady who came, I didn't talk to her, actually,"
00:17:04,00:17:05,but she came.
00:17:05,00:17:06,She'd been up all night.
00:17:06,00:17:07,[LAUGHTER]
00:17:07,00:17:08,Doing what?
00:17:08,00:17:10,In the woods with her horse?
00:17:10,00:17:11,Having satanic sex in the woods.
00:17:11,00:17:12,No.
00:17:12,00:17:13,"Basically, yeah."
00:17:13,00:17:18,And the big issue for Sunday Morning Live was that she wasn't wearing a bra
00:17:18,00:17:20,and you could see really--
00:17:20,00:17:22,"see her nipples really, really clearly."
00:17:22,00:17:23,"Oh, wait."
00:17:23,00:17:24,Was it radio or TV?
00:17:24,00:17:25,TV.
00:17:25,00:17:26,Or three of TV.
00:17:26,00:17:27,[LAUGHTER]
00:17:27,00:17:28,"So it's like, how are we going to--"
00:17:28,00:17:30,"Why would that story be relevant if it was radio, Andy?"
00:17:30,00:17:34,[LAUGHTER]
00:17:34,00:17:38,How are we going to gaffotate the witches' nips?
00:17:38,00:17:40,[LAUGHTER]
00:17:40,00:17:41,Wow.
00:17:41,00:17:42,"So the Wiccan thing is a bit different, yeah."
00:17:42,00:17:43,Was she satanic?
00:17:43,00:17:45,"Like, did you feel that she was pushing the Satan?"
00:17:45,00:17:47,"I didn't particularly talk to her, no."
00:17:47,00:17:49,"I think they-- yeah, no."
00:17:49,00:17:51,"No, I don't-- no, I don't think so."
00:17:51,00:17:52,[LAUGHTER]
00:17:52,00:17:53,"I mean, I didn't talk to--"
00:17:53,00:17:56,"I don't know what happened, but it's like, whatever spell she put on you,"
00:17:56,00:17:58,it just suddenly kicked in.
00:17:58,00:17:59,[LAUGHTER]
00:17:59,00:18:03,"Honestly, I'm a bit scared of witches and Satan."
00:18:03,00:18:04,Yeah.
00:18:04,00:18:06,"So is David Bowie, so it's fine."
00:18:06,00:18:07,[LAUGHTER]
00:18:07,00:18:08,He was once exercised.
00:18:08,00:18:12,He got someone to do spells of protection.
00:18:12,00:18:13,Right.
00:18:13,00:18:16,"Well, he used to collect his urine and little bottles, kind of like how Hugh Hefner"
00:18:16,00:18:18,"did, because he was worried that witches were going to steal them"
00:18:18,00:18:19,and do black magic with them.
00:18:19,00:18:20,"Oh, no."
00:18:20,00:18:22,But he would collect all of it.
00:18:22,00:18:23,What do you mean?
00:18:23,00:18:25,He kind of collected all of his urine and bottles to prevent theft.
00:18:25,00:18:26,[LAUGHTER]
00:18:26,00:18:28,Because that's such an unsustainable--
00:18:28,00:18:29,"I mean, I know he was rich."
00:18:29,00:18:30,I know he was like a wealthy guy.
00:18:30,00:18:34,If someone had enough money for jars to sustain every passing of urine--
00:18:34,00:18:36,Imagine how much it would fetch now.
00:18:36,00:18:38,And I absolutely would buy some of it.
00:18:38,00:18:39,"Oh, yeah, yeah, of course."
00:18:39,00:18:42,"But I also think, like, if you just piss it down the toilet,"
00:18:42,00:18:45,that's probably safer than keeping it in bottles in your house.
00:18:45,00:18:46,That's so much safer.
00:18:46,00:18:47,Yeah.
00:18:47,00:18:48,"Yeah, it must be, right?"
00:18:48,00:18:50,"Because once you've got it in bottles, people--"
00:18:50,00:18:52,"No, but you're forgetting about filming trailers."
00:18:52,00:18:53,Because--
00:18:53,00:18:54,"Oh, yeah."
00:18:54,00:18:58,"Yeah, and filming-- because there was-- I think I might have made this up."
00:18:58,00:18:59,[LAUGHTER]
00:18:59,00:19:05,But I feel like there was an issue of people going to Justin Timberlake's
00:19:05,00:19:08,filming trailer and trying to steal his turrets out there.
00:19:08,00:19:09,"Oh, because it's held in a tank."
00:19:09,00:19:11,"Yeah, yeah, of course, yeah."
00:19:11,00:19:12,No.
00:19:12,00:19:13,Did I dream that?
00:19:13,00:19:14,[LAUGHTER]
00:19:14,00:19:16,That would be so worrying if I did.
00:19:16,00:19:17,"I feel that was a thing, then."
00:19:17,00:19:18,And what were they going to do with it?
00:19:18,00:19:19,Were they going to clone it?
00:19:19,00:19:20,eBay?
00:19:20,00:19:21,All right.
00:19:21,00:19:25,"No, no, just use it and use it for spells, I guess, was his--"
00:19:25,00:19:27,we've got to remember that this is a guy who was so coked off his head
00:19:27,00:19:29,that he was collecting in his own piss in bottles.
00:19:29,00:19:32,I don't think there was logic to his reasoning.
00:19:32,00:19:34,I think he just was scared of a--
00:19:34,00:19:37,"But there is a whole thing of collecting, you know, hairs and stuff,"
00:19:37,00:19:38,isn't there?
00:19:38,00:19:40,"Well, yeah, I mean, so that's a thing."
00:19:40,00:19:43,So Yoko Ono used to be seen as someone that potentially--
00:19:43,00:19:45,"you know, she had an album called Yes, I Am a Witch"
00:19:45,00:19:48,because she was presented as someone who might be a witch.
00:19:48,00:19:52,And she bought a single mustache hair off of Salvador Dali.
00:19:52,00:19:55,"She paid him for it, and he sent it over in a box."
00:19:55,00:19:58,"And years later, it was revealed by the partner of Salvador Dali"
00:19:58,00:20:01,that he was so scared that she was going to use it for witchcraft
00:20:01,00:20:04,that he ended up sending a painted bit of a blade of grass
00:20:04,00:20:06,that he picked from his lawn.
00:20:06,00:20:08,"But she never noticed, according to the story."
00:20:08,00:20:10,But he was petrified that Yoko Ono--
00:20:10,00:20:13,"Yeah, well, there was the whole satanic panic, wasn't there?"
00:20:13,00:20:15,Was it '70s and '80s?
00:20:15,00:20:17,Were they thought McDonald's were haunted?
00:20:17,00:20:18,Possessed?
00:20:18,00:20:19,McDonald's?
00:20:19,00:20:21,"No, the whole satanic panic where--"
00:20:21,00:20:24,McDonald's got a letter from a woman in Ohio
00:20:24,00:20:28,"asking why the owner, Ray Crock,"
00:20:28,00:20:30,was a financial supporter of the Church of Satan.
00:20:30,00:20:33,And it was a rumor that just spread--
00:20:33,00:20:36,she said she'd seen him on the Phil Donahue show
00:20:36,00:20:39,saying he supported the Church of Satan.
00:20:39,00:20:41,And he hadn't said that.
00:20:41,00:20:44,"But she told her pastor, and her pastor put it in the church's newsletter,"
00:20:44,00:20:47,which was called Moments of Sunshine.
00:20:47,00:20:52,"And very quickly, that spread across America"
00:20:52,00:20:54,via church newsletters.
00:20:54,00:20:57,So McDonald's had to send executives out to these churches
00:20:57,00:21:01,with sworn statements insisting that Crock never said those things.
00:21:01,00:21:03,"It was a real panic, wasn't it?"
00:21:03,00:21:07,And the expert on it these days is a guy called Dr. David Frankfurter.
00:21:07,00:21:12,And what he thinks is it was basically like a sort of a loop
00:21:12,00:21:15,"where you would have these evangelical Christians saying,"
00:21:15,00:21:16,"""This is happening."""
00:21:16,00:21:19,And then people were using hypnotic regression techniques
00:21:19,00:21:24,to try and remember things that they supposedly suppressed in their lives.
00:21:24,00:21:26,And then really what they would do is kind of say
00:21:26,00:21:28,what the hypnotists wanted them to say.
00:21:28,00:21:30,You just had this kind of feedback loop
00:21:30,00:21:33,"that eventually there was, in theory, in some of the newspapers they were saying,"
00:21:33,00:21:36,there were thousands of these Satanists around America doing this.
00:21:36,00:21:37,Yeah.
00:21:37,00:21:39,I've got a fact for you.
00:21:39,00:21:40,Okay.
00:21:40,00:21:45,"In 2021, in the UK, more babies were named Lucifer than Nigel."
00:21:45,00:21:47,Do you have the numbers? Do we know how many?
00:21:47,00:21:48,15 Lucifers?
00:21:48,00:21:49,Yeah.
00:21:49,00:21:50,No more than two Nigels.
00:21:50,00:21:51,No!
00:21:51,00:21:52,"Oh, my word."
00:21:52,00:21:53,It doesn't appear on the list.
00:21:53,00:21:54,"You know that thing where if there are under three,"
00:21:54,00:21:56,they don't say how many there are.
00:21:56,00:21:59,And do we think that it's because Nigel is associated with evil these days?
00:21:59,00:22:03,[LAUGHTER]
00:22:03,00:22:06,"Did you come across a thing of 666, though?"
00:22:06,00:22:07,Yeah.
00:22:07,00:22:09,"So I'd always thought that 666, the number of the beast,"
00:22:09,00:22:12,"was about the number of perfection being seven,"
00:22:12,00:22:15,and so six being imperfection.
00:22:15,00:22:17,That's what I thought it was.
00:22:17,00:22:23,"But then, today, I discovered that there's a thing called isosephi,"
00:22:23,00:22:25,which is letters equivalent to numbers.
00:22:25,00:22:29,"And apparently, this was very, very common in 1st and 2nd century CE."
00:22:29,00:22:35,So you would quite often refer to people with a number.
00:22:35,00:22:42,"So a joke was, by Seatonius, a calculation knew Nero his mother slew."
00:22:42,00:22:46,"And in this case, the emperor Nero equals 1005,"
00:22:46,00:22:49,which is the same value as the phrase his mother slew.
00:22:49,00:22:54,"And apparently, most people think if you say 666, it stands for seasonero."
00:22:54,00:22:59,"So in some early versions of the Bible, in Revelations from Revelations 13,"
00:22:59,00:23:03,the Latin version has the numbers being 616.
00:23:03,00:23:04,Right.
00:23:04,00:23:08,"And that's because in Latin, Nero is 616, not 666."
00:23:08,00:23:12,And the reason we think that is because Revelation was written by very early Christians.
00:23:12,00:23:15,It's one of the earliest of the New Testament books.
00:23:15,00:23:19,"And really, they were just being persecuted by Nero, so they saw him as the devil."
00:23:19,00:23:25,But he was actually a good guy.
00:23:25,00:23:27,"Well, I wouldn't go quite that far."
00:23:27,00:23:29,"I mean, it depends what side you're on."
00:23:29,00:23:31,"If you're on Nero's side, he's a great guy."
00:23:31,00:23:38,He used to drink an energy drink that was made by soaking roasted dung in vinegar.
00:23:38,00:23:42,"But that's still how they, that's Red Bull, that is."
00:23:42,00:23:44,Now that's Steven Seagal's energy drink.
00:23:44,00:23:45,Have you seen those adverts?
00:23:45,00:23:46,"Oh, yeah."
00:23:46,00:23:47,They're unbelievable.
00:23:47,00:23:48,I've not seen the ads.
00:23:48,00:23:49,You've got to see the ads.
00:23:49,00:23:50,What are they called?
00:23:50,00:23:51,You've got to see the ads.
00:23:51,00:23:52,What's it called?
00:23:52,00:23:53,I can't remember.
00:23:53,00:23:54,I used to drink it all the time.
00:23:54,00:23:55,"Steven, what?"
00:23:55,00:23:56,"Yeah, I don't know why."
00:23:56,00:23:57,Why?
00:23:57,00:23:58,I went through a period.
00:23:58,00:24:01,"Well, my local corner shop just stocked things like Marley's Mellow Mood,"
00:24:01,00:24:03,"which was a Bob Marley energy drink, but it was sort of an opposite."
00:24:03,00:24:04,What?
00:24:04,00:24:05,A Bob Marley energy drink.
00:24:05,00:24:06,Yeah.
00:24:06,00:24:08,It was a sort of Bob Marley anti-energy drink.
00:24:08,00:24:13,"And it said on the side, ""Whatever you do, don't drive a truck after two of these."""
00:24:13,00:24:19,"This store, it had all the collection of every celebrity's weird..."
00:24:19,00:24:22,"What's amazing, Dan, is that this was at the end of your street."
00:24:22,00:24:25,You would be the only person in the world who would buy this stuff.
00:24:25,00:24:26,"Yeah, exactly."
00:24:26,00:24:27,They probably only...
00:24:27,00:24:29,"They were like, ""Oh, we accidentally ordered this one time."""
00:24:29,00:24:32,"""Oh, it's selling every week for this one guy."""
00:24:32,00:24:33,Let's keep getting it.
00:24:33,00:24:34,"It was really powerful, his drink."
00:24:34,00:24:35,Yeah.
00:24:35,00:24:36,"Yeah, the Steven Seagal one."
00:24:36,00:24:38,It's the most misogynistic advert I've ever seen.
00:24:38,00:24:39,"Oh, really?"
00:24:39,00:24:41,And he's not even bothered to turn up.
00:24:41,00:24:42,You just have to watch it.
00:24:42,00:24:44,"Okay, that wasn't on the can."
00:24:44,00:24:45,It's awful.
00:24:45,00:24:46,It's in there.
00:24:46,00:24:50,I can't believe I was the sole funder of that ad.
00:24:50,00:24:59,"It is time for fact number three, and that is Andy."
00:24:59,00:25:04,My fact is that roughly 3% of our entire planet is called Jason.
00:25:04,00:25:08,How much is called Nigel?
00:25:08,00:25:09,I'm shrinking about it.
00:25:09,00:25:10,"Yeah, so this is an amazing..."
00:25:10,00:25:11,"Okay, this is amazing, right?"
00:25:11,00:25:15,"Now, this is not 3% of all people on the planet are called Jason, right?"
00:25:15,00:25:20,This is 3% of the Earth itself is named Jason.
00:25:20,00:25:21,By whom?
00:25:21,00:25:22,By...
00:25:22,00:25:23,Jason?
00:25:23,00:25:25,By geologists and seismologists.
00:25:25,00:25:26,So they're...
00:25:26,00:25:29,"Okay, this is a bit technical, but there are these two mysterious..."
00:25:29,00:25:31,Sound like Dan when I read this out.
00:25:31,00:25:36,"There are these mysterious structures inside the Earth, right?"
00:25:36,00:25:37,"There are two of them, okay?"
00:25:37,00:25:39,And they are these massive blobs.
00:25:39,00:25:44,"They're called LLSVPs, large, low shear velocity provinces, right?"
00:25:44,00:25:48,"Now, there's one beneath Africa and there's one under the Pacific."
00:25:48,00:25:52,And that's obviously a very technical name for them.
00:25:52,00:25:53,And they're not very well known about.
00:25:53,00:25:59,"They're not very well researched because they are where the mantle of the Earth meets the core of the Earth, okay?"
00:25:59,00:26:01,"So the Earth goes crust, not very much."
00:26:01,00:26:03,"Mantle, quite a bit."
00:26:03,00:26:04,"Core, quite a bit more."
00:26:04,00:26:08,And they're at the junction point between the mantle and the core.
00:26:08,00:26:09,So they're really hard to research.
00:26:09,00:26:13,And the researchers have named them Tuzo and Jason.
00:26:13,00:26:15,They are billions of years old and between them they are...
00:26:15,00:26:16,Both blocs.
00:26:16,00:26:19,That's true.
00:26:19,00:26:21,They're named after two geological scientists.
00:26:21,00:26:22,"So they are, yeah."
00:26:22,00:26:24,And we don't know what they are.
00:26:24,00:26:28,"They might be offcuts from another planet, which is exciting."
00:26:28,00:26:32,"There's a theoretical planet called Thea from four and a half billion years ago,"
00:26:32,00:26:36,which might have crashed into Earth and might have been subsumed.
00:26:36,00:26:37,That's possible.
00:26:37,00:26:38,Right.
00:26:38,00:26:40,"Yeah, we don't know exactly what they are."
00:26:40,00:26:42,But they are incredible and they're there.
00:26:42,00:26:43,And this...
00:26:43,00:26:46,I don't know why I'm having to justify their existence.
00:26:46,00:26:47,This is proper...
00:26:47,00:26:49,I just spent 15 minutes talking about Satan.
00:26:49,00:26:53,These are real geological structures in the planet.
00:26:53,00:26:54,They're awesome.
00:26:54,00:26:56,"No, yeah, it was wonderful."
00:26:56,00:27:01,Why aren't you more excited?
00:27:01,00:27:05,"In all honesty, it's because an eBay auction came up on my phone"
00:27:05,00:27:08,"saying you got three minutes to bid, so I suddenly was focused on that."
00:27:08,00:27:09,Are you joking?
00:27:09,00:27:12,I didn't bid in the end.
00:27:12,00:27:15,How much was it for that swimming pool of David Bowie's bottled urine?
00:27:15,00:27:18,Are we saying that there's...
00:27:18,00:27:20,Because the description I read is that it's...
00:27:20,00:27:24,There's mountains there that are taller than Mount Everest.
00:27:24,00:27:25,Yes.
00:27:25,00:27:27,But what does that mean?
00:27:27,00:27:30,"It's not the Hollow Earth we're talking about, right?"
00:27:30,00:27:32,There's no space around the mountains.
00:27:32,00:27:33,Oh!
00:27:33,00:27:36,It's just different rock that might have been this other mystery planet.
00:27:36,00:27:41,"Yeah, in fact, near Jason and Tuzo, there are these enormous mega mountains"
00:27:41,00:27:43,and they're at that junction point as well.
00:27:43,00:27:47,They are called ultra low velocity zones and it's this weird boundary zone.
00:27:47,00:27:49,"I did read something, I can't get my head around this."
00:27:49,00:27:53,Scientists claim that the gap between the core and the mantle
00:27:53,00:27:57,is bigger than the change between rock and air.
00:27:57,00:27:59,"No, I can't understand that."
00:27:59,00:28:01,"It's because of the high pressure, right?"
00:28:01,00:28:02,"Right, yeah, yeah."
00:28:02,00:28:03,That is amazing.
00:28:03,00:28:07,And they're only found because scientists can track earthquakes through the Earth
00:28:07,00:28:11,"and you spot where the reverberations, how long they take to get through the Earth"
00:28:11,00:28:14,and you can build up a profile very slowly and carefully
00:28:14,00:28:18,of what the different structures are based on how fast waves travel.
00:28:18,00:28:20,This is just news to me that...
00:28:20,00:28:21,Right.
00:28:21,00:28:23,"Because last time I did geography, I was a child"
00:28:23,00:28:25,and I thought it was...
00:28:25,00:28:27,Then there was magma.
00:28:27,00:28:31,The mantle is much more fluid and then there's an outer liquid core in it in a solid core.
00:28:31,00:28:32,"So, yeah."
00:28:32,00:28:34,There's space around Jason.
00:28:34,00:28:35,"No, that was me."
00:28:35,00:28:36,There's no space at all.
00:28:36,00:28:37,There's no space at all.
00:28:37,00:28:39,So in what sense is Jason a mountain?
00:28:39,00:28:41,It's a different type of rock.
00:28:41,00:28:44,You've got the sort of quite liquid mantle
00:28:44,00:28:47,"but you've got much more solid rock, which is this Jason stuff, is that right?"
00:28:47,00:28:48,"That's right, yeah, yeah."
00:28:48,00:28:51,But I think it's really interesting that these are named after blokes
00:28:51,00:28:54,because actually quite a lot of this science was done by women.
00:28:54,00:28:56,"Right, so a..."
00:28:56,00:28:58,"Sorry, did you say you were surprised?"
00:28:58,00:29:01,"Yeah, it's so weird."
00:29:01,00:29:02,It's so weird.
00:29:02,00:29:04,Everything else has happened in history.
00:29:04,00:29:06,It's bizarre.
00:29:06,00:29:08,"One person, for instance, Inga Lehmann,"
00:29:08,00:29:11,she was the first to work out that the Earth had a solid core.
00:29:11,00:29:14,"And what it was, again, it's like the vibrations going through the Earth"
00:29:14,00:29:16,and they realised there must have been a core there
00:29:16,00:29:18,because the vibrations would come after an earthquake
00:29:18,00:29:21,"and then if you were exactly opposite the earthquake, you wouldn't see them."
00:29:21,00:29:23,And so there must have been something liquid there.
00:29:23,00:29:26,"But actually, she noticed that if you looked at seismographs,"
00:29:26,00:29:29,"there were really, really tiny amounts of vibrations."
00:29:29,00:29:31,So it wasn't completely dark.
00:29:31,00:29:36,And what she realised was that this was because there was also a solid core
00:29:36,00:29:38,inside the liquid core.
00:29:38,00:29:40,"But they all thought that, you know, she must be wrong"
00:29:40,00:29:43,and it must have been like a discrepancy in the seismographs.
00:29:43,00:29:44,The seismographs must be wrong
00:29:44,00:29:47,because this woman can't possibly be right that there's an extra core in there.
00:29:47,00:29:50,But it turned out like in 1970.
00:29:50,00:29:52,I think she was still alive.
00:29:52,00:29:54,"But we found out, yeah, we found out that it was true."
00:29:54,00:29:56,Wow. Amazing.
00:29:56,00:29:58,So I've got a couple of things on Jason Statham.
00:29:58,00:30:01,Me too.
00:30:01,00:30:07,"I don't know, is it like a sandwich you got from your local shop?"
00:30:07,00:30:11,I was just looking into notable Jason's
00:30:11,00:30:13,because I thought that's the territory.
00:30:13,00:30:15,Are you joking?
00:30:15,00:30:19,I've got eight pages of dense geological data.
00:30:20,00:30:22,Jason Statham is in Meg too.
00:30:22,00:30:24,He's massive.
00:30:24,00:30:25,"Yeah, he is. He's incredible."
00:30:25,00:30:28,"So he was filming Expendables 3, I think it was."
00:30:28,00:30:29,I've got this too.
00:30:29,00:30:32,Have you got this? Amazing story. Amazing story.
00:30:32,00:30:37,We're literally going from the structure of the entire
00:30:37,00:30:40,"all life, all of everything we've ever known."
00:30:40,00:30:42,These amazing scientists.
00:30:42,00:30:44,"Yeah, sorry, the Expendables 3."
00:30:44,00:30:45,"He's in a car, yeah."
00:30:45,00:30:47,You listen to this and tell me you're not amazed.
00:30:47,00:30:50,He's in a car and he's doing a scene and suddenly...
00:30:50,00:30:52,He likes to do his own stunts.
00:30:52,00:30:54,"Loves to do his own stunts, Jason, doesn't he?"
00:30:54,00:30:56,"Yeah, and he needs to hit the brakes"
00:30:56,00:30:58,because he needs to stop before there's a cliff
00:30:58,00:31:00,which drops 60 feet into the black sea.
00:31:00,00:31:02,"Gosh, 60 feet? 60 feet."
00:31:02,00:31:05,"That's nearly as much as the 2,000 miles of mantle"
00:31:05,00:31:08,between the crust and the core.
00:31:08,00:31:14,"So the brakes fail, Statham's in the car"
00:31:14,00:31:16,and it goes off the cliff.
00:31:16,00:31:18,This is a Hollywood film.
00:31:18,00:31:21,He's plunging 60 feet into...
00:31:21,00:31:23,A three-ton stunt truck.
00:31:23,00:31:24,A three-ton stunt truck.
00:31:24,00:31:25,"Sorry, he's driving the truck."
00:31:25,00:31:26,He's driving the truck.
00:31:26,00:31:28,He's driving the truck. We're not listening?
00:31:28,00:31:32,And so then he should crash.
00:31:32,00:31:34,"Anyone else, any other of the Expendables,"
00:31:34,00:31:36,"you put Stallone in there, you put Schwarzenegger."
00:31:36,00:31:38,"They would die in that moment, right?"
00:31:38,00:31:42,Statham manages to leap out of the car
00:31:42,00:31:45,and successfully dive into the ocean
00:31:45,00:31:47,and then comes up and he's all okay.
00:31:47,00:31:48,"And why is he okay, Sally?"
00:31:48,00:31:51,"He's okay because before he became an actor,"
00:31:51,00:31:54,"he was a competitive diver, genuinely."
00:31:54,00:31:56,And he's done a lot of free diving
00:31:56,00:31:58,and has got a lot of scuba experience.
00:31:58,00:31:59,Exactly.
00:31:59,00:32:01,"But he was very, very good at diving,"
00:32:01,00:32:03,"but not quite good enough to make the Olympic team,"
00:32:03,00:32:04,so he decided to branch out.
00:32:04,00:32:06,"Exactly, but he did represent Britain"
00:32:06,00:32:08,in the Commonwealth Games in 1990.
00:32:08,00:32:10,"Oh, so it's not like scuba diving, it's highboard diving."
00:32:10,00:32:12,"Highboard diving, which he used to practice"
00:32:12,00:32:14,in Crystal Palace as a highboard there
00:32:14,00:32:17,and they have a pool there where Tom Daly would practice as well.
00:32:17,00:32:19,"And before Tom Daly, Jason Statham, he would be there."
00:32:19,00:32:20,That's incredible.
00:32:20,00:32:22,"So Jason Statham, that's really interesting"
00:32:22,00:32:24,"because Jason Statham, that means it might have been helpful"
00:32:24,00:32:32,in the first attempt to dig down into the Earth's mantle in 1961.
00:32:32,00:32:37,"So this was a thing called Project Mohole, okay?"
00:32:37,00:32:39,"It was an attempt to find the lower limit of the Earth's crust,"
00:32:39,00:32:42,"which is very, very thick on land and much thinner over the ocean."
00:32:42,00:32:45,"The USA was losing the space race in 1961,"
00:32:45,00:32:48,"the Soviets were way ahead, and so the USA said,"
00:32:48,00:32:51,"""Well, just dig instead and we'll do better at digging"
00:32:51,00:32:53,"and that'll be our new thing."""
00:32:53,00:32:58,So they tried to get down beyond this thin layer of crust
00:32:58,00:32:59,"where it meets the mantle,"
00:32:59,00:33:02,which is a point called the Mohovovich discontinuity.
00:33:02,00:33:04,It didn't work.
00:33:04,00:33:06,So they went into the ocean.
00:33:06,00:33:08,The weirdest thing was that there was a ship
00:33:08,00:33:11,which was sent to do the drilling operation
00:33:11,00:33:13,to keep it stable in the same bit of the ocean.
00:33:13,00:33:15,Their solution was they fitted propellers
00:33:15,00:33:17,all the way around the outside
00:33:17,00:33:19,and they just fired them all at the same time.
00:33:19,00:33:21,That's brilliant.
00:33:21,00:33:23,"They probably needed marine biologists on the boat, right,"
00:33:23,00:33:25,in order to do the science.
00:33:25,00:33:27,I'm not falling for it.
00:33:27,00:33:30,"Did you know that Jason Momoa,"
00:33:30,00:33:35,"who became Aquaman later in his career,"
00:33:35,00:33:39,first studied marine biology when he was at university
00:33:39,00:33:42,before transferring to wildlife biology?
00:33:42,00:33:45,"That is so interesting, Dad. Thank you."
00:33:45,00:33:48,They did have a kind of hero beginning with Jay
00:33:48,00:33:50,and Jay named Hero there
00:33:50,00:33:52,because John Steinbeck was present of Mice and Men.
00:33:52,00:33:54,John Steinbeck.
00:33:54,00:33:57,"He was there kind of writing about it,"
00:33:57,00:33:59,but sadly it didn't work.
00:33:59,00:34:01,"Gosh, you weren't kidding."
00:34:01,00:34:03,"In the dressing room he said,"
00:34:03,00:34:08,"""I've got 15 minutes brilliant material on Jason."""
00:34:08,00:34:10,There is a bit of advance this year.
00:34:10,00:34:12,"This is quite sort of geeky now,"
00:34:12,00:34:14,but scientists have just extracted a chunk of the mantle
00:34:14,00:34:16,for the first time.
00:34:16,00:34:18,Of Earth's mantle?
00:34:18,00:34:20,"We're trying to work out how to do it, right?"
00:34:20,00:34:22,"And they realized they don't go to the mantle,"
00:34:22,00:34:25,go to where rock from the mantle has been pushed
00:34:25,00:34:27,above its normal resting place.
00:34:27,00:34:30,"So they drilled into an underwater mountain,"
00:34:30,00:34:33,but like a normal underwater mountain is in
00:34:33,00:34:35,at the bottom of the mid-Atlantic ridge.
00:34:35,00:34:37,They drilled in slightly sideways
00:34:37,00:34:39,"and they have a core of mantle rock,"
00:34:39,00:34:41,"which is a kilometre long,"
00:34:41,00:34:43,and they've extracted that core
00:34:43,00:34:45,and that allowed them to study all sorts of things
00:34:45,00:34:47,about the deep Earth.
00:34:47,00:34:49,So cool.
00:34:49,00:34:51,That's incredible.
00:34:51,00:34:53,"All I've got going on here is,"
00:34:53,00:34:55,"""You can keep it on your mantle piece."""
00:34:55,00:34:58,"I just can't join in with the science stuff, really."
00:34:58,00:35:03,"Well, Jason Statham."
00:35:03,00:35:05,I do have a fact about Jason Statham.
00:35:05,00:35:08,"Oh, look who goes crawling back to the other side."
00:35:08,00:35:13,"He fits very well as in he would be a great action hero,"
00:35:13,00:35:15,"even with his, you know,"
00:35:15,00:35:17,"his human name, as in his name,"
00:35:17,00:35:19,is a good name for an action hero.
00:35:19,00:35:21,"So is it not his real name, Jason Statham?"
00:35:21,00:35:23,"No, it is his real name, as far as I know."
00:35:23,00:35:25,But my point is that action heroes
00:35:25,00:35:27,tend to have names beginning with J.
00:35:27,00:35:29,"James Bond, Jason Bourne,"
00:35:29,00:35:31,"John Wick, Jack Reacher, John McLean,"
00:35:31,00:35:33,John James Rambo.
00:35:33,00:35:35,"Oh, yeah."
00:35:35,00:35:37,"And there was a study, a brilliant study,"
00:35:37,00:35:39,"by a writer at Slate called Demetria Glace,"
00:35:39,00:35:41,"and she studied 2,000 action movies,"
00:35:41,00:35:43,pretty much every modern Western action movie
00:35:43,00:35:46,with a male sort of single everyman protagonist.
00:35:46,00:35:49,"A third of them had names beginning with J,"
00:35:49,00:35:51,which is very unusual.
00:35:51,00:35:54,Do you know that the Earth is younger on the inside
00:35:54,00:35:56,than it is on the outside?
00:35:56,00:35:58,What?
00:35:58,00:36:00,So when you get to the mantle level up here...
00:36:00,00:36:02,Judas.
00:36:02,00:36:04,That would be a good name for an action movie.
00:36:04,00:36:06,"Judas, great action story, yeah."
00:36:06,00:36:08,This is like Freaky Friday.
00:36:08,00:36:10,Yeah.
00:36:10,00:36:12,"So as we saw in the movie Interstellar,"
00:36:12,00:36:15,"where when Matthew McConaughey is travelling out into space,"
00:36:15,00:36:17,"gravity distorts time, doesn't it?"
00:36:17,00:36:19,And there's a reason that we say that
00:36:19,00:36:21,"when astronauts are in space, they're almost time travellers,"
00:36:21,00:36:24,"because they age differently, because time travels differently."
00:36:24,00:36:26,"If you were at the core of our planet,"
00:36:26,00:36:29,"and that means then the core of our planet itself,"
00:36:29,00:36:31,is travelling at a different time.
00:36:31,00:36:34,"Two and a half years younger than the rest of our planet,"
00:36:34,00:36:36,"because gravity is so intense down there,"
00:36:36,00:36:38,that it slowed down time.
00:36:38,00:36:40,That's pretty cool.
00:36:40,00:36:42,Whatever.
00:36:42,00:36:44,"OK, let me tell you one thing about geology,"
00:36:44,00:36:47,"which this will totally blow your mind, right?"
00:36:47,00:36:49,So there's a place called the Heart Mountain
00:36:49,00:36:51,in Northwest America.
00:36:51,00:36:55,"And I'm talking quite a lot of millions of years ago,"
00:36:55,00:36:58,but at one stage that mountain moved
00:36:58,00:37:01,62 miles in half an hour.
00:37:01,00:37:03,Really? The entire mountain.
00:37:03,00:37:05,What? Isn't that amazing?
00:37:05,00:37:07,"So there's a load of basically magma,"
00:37:07,00:37:09,"there's a big sort of river of magma there,"
00:37:09,00:37:12,"a load of water got into it, there was a massive explosion,"
00:37:12,00:37:16,and the entire mountain moved at 100 miles an hour.
00:37:16,00:37:18,"Oh, my word. No."
00:37:18,00:37:20,But half an hour.
00:37:20,00:37:22,We're talking millions and millions and millions of years ago.
00:37:22,00:37:24,"Oh, this was last year."
00:37:24,00:37:27,"So you just go skiing and you're like, oh, my God!"
00:37:27,00:37:29,Whoa!
00:37:29,00:37:33,Are we there yet? It's right here.
00:37:33,00:37:35,"Oh, fuck. No. Sorry, kids."
00:37:35,00:37:43,"OK, it is time for our final fact of the show,"
00:37:43,00:37:45,and that is James.
00:37:45,00:37:48,"OK, my fact this week is that you could tell the social status"
00:37:48,00:37:53,of an ancient Egyptian man by the colour of his condom.
00:37:55,00:38:01,"I mean, surely you would have an inkling before you got to see him."
00:38:01,00:38:05,"Or it's a shock, isn't it?"
00:38:05,00:38:07,You told me you were a pharaoh!
00:38:07,00:38:12,"It's bizarre, isn't it?"
00:38:12,00:38:14,I've read this in a couple of places.
00:38:14,00:38:17,One is an article in the Indian Journal of Urology
00:38:17,00:38:19,called The Story of the Condom.
00:38:19,00:38:21,One is from an article from the Egypt Museum
00:38:21,00:38:23,"who have one of these very, very old condoms."
00:38:23,00:38:26,"And basically, they didn't use them for contraception."
00:38:26,00:38:29,"They used them to stop diseases,"
00:38:29,00:38:32,"but they also, an insect bite, nearly."
00:38:32,00:38:36,But they also used them as an insignia of rencore status.
00:38:36,00:38:38,"And it was just, when I say condom,"
00:38:38,00:38:42,"I think some of it might have been more like, almost like cod piece."
00:38:42,00:38:44,"Oh, OK. Right."
00:38:44,00:38:46,But they were used against diseases as well.
00:38:46,00:38:49,"So, you know, we can technically call them condoms."
00:38:49,00:38:51,"And they were made of linen, soaked in olive oil."
00:38:51,00:38:53,OK. And with different colours.
00:38:53,00:38:55,"The problem is, of all the sauces,"
00:38:55,00:38:57,"maybe you guys found this, but if all the sauces that I found,"
00:38:57,00:38:59,"really good academic sauces,"
00:38:59,00:39:01,none of them told you what colour you're aiming for.
00:39:01,00:39:03,"Oh, right."
00:39:03,00:39:05,"So, I don't know if red was a good one"
00:39:05,00:39:07,or if blue was a good one.
00:39:07,00:39:09,"They've got Tutankhamun's condom, haven't they?"
00:39:09,00:39:11,"Do they? Yeah, they do."
00:39:11,00:39:14,"Yes, they do. Linen, soaked in olive oil,"
00:39:14,00:39:16,impregnated with his DNA.
00:39:16,00:39:18,And it would tie around to his waist.
00:39:18,00:39:21,Tie around to his waist with string.
00:39:21,00:39:23,But it didn't mention what colour it was.
00:39:23,00:39:25,They didn't mention the colour.
00:39:25,00:39:27,Why are we not getting the colour system?
00:39:27,00:39:29,Sometimes the colours don't...
00:39:29,00:39:31,"Yeah, right. OK. Gosh."
00:39:31,00:39:33,That's very interesting.
00:39:33,00:39:35,"In the course of researching this,"
00:39:35,00:39:37,"I read probably the weirdest thing I think I've ever read,"
00:39:37,00:39:40,"which is in ancient Rome, condoms."
00:39:40,00:39:43,"And by the way, I haven't found a legit sauce,"
00:39:43,00:39:45,but it appears in so many...
00:39:45,00:39:47,"No, it appears in so many places."
00:39:47,00:39:50,"They used, apparently, an ancient Roman"
00:39:50,00:39:52,who was victorious in a battle
00:39:52,00:39:54,"and had slain his opponent,"
00:39:54,00:39:57,would then make a condom out of the muscle of the opponent.
00:39:57,00:39:59,"Oh, don't be daft."
00:39:59,00:40:03,Sauce.
00:40:03,00:40:07,"Well, they did use to make condoms out of animal intestines"
00:40:07,00:40:09,and bladders in Rome. Yeah.
00:40:09,00:40:11,So it's not impossible.
00:40:11,00:40:13,It's not impossible. It feels a bit grisly.
00:40:13,00:40:15,It feels a bit grisly. It's sort of one of those facts
00:40:15,00:40:17,that I prefer. I'm just going to prefer not to believe.
00:40:17,00:40:19,Yeah. I know.
00:40:19,00:40:21,"The ancient Egyptians used to use crocodile dung as spermicide,"
00:40:21,00:40:23,did you? Yeah.
00:40:23,00:40:25,How would you use that? You would use...
00:40:25,00:40:27,I don't want to think about it.
00:40:27,00:40:29,Why is no one sleeping with me?
00:40:29,00:40:31,Uncovered crocodile shit.
00:40:31,00:40:33,"Do you know that William Buckland,"
00:40:33,00:40:35,"you know the natural... Yeah, who ate everything, yeah."
00:40:35,00:40:38,His kids had a hobby horse made out of a dead crocodile.
00:40:38,00:40:40,Wow. I don't know why that came into my head.
00:40:40,00:40:42,Yeah.
00:40:42,00:40:44,My friend Cindy used to have the crocodile
00:40:44,00:40:46,that was used in crocodile dundee as a...
00:40:46,00:40:48,"Like, they had prop crocodiles,"
00:40:48,00:40:50,"and as you went into her house,"
00:40:50,00:40:52,she had the prop crocodile from croc dundee.
00:40:52,00:40:54,Wow. There's no more iconic prop.
00:40:54,00:40:56,"No, no. Was it a real crocodile?"
00:40:56,00:40:58,"No, no. Was it a pretend crocodile?"
00:40:58,00:41:00,"No, I think it was a pretend crocodile, yeah."
00:41:00,00:41:02,"Condoms, just quickly. Yeah."
00:41:02,00:41:05,"So the condoms of the 18th century were quite interesting,"
00:41:05,00:41:08,"because that was sort of getting towards modern condoms,"
00:41:08,00:41:10,but they're still very primitive.
00:41:10,00:41:13,"So they were made of sheep kycom, okay,"
00:41:13,00:41:15,which is the power that connects the small
00:41:15,00:41:18,and the large intestine to each other of the sheep.
00:41:18,00:41:20,"And they had to be treated,"
00:41:20,00:41:22,and there was a whole nine-step process
00:41:22,00:41:25,"to make a proper condom out of a sheep's thing, kycom."
00:41:25,00:41:27,And they were really scarce.
00:41:27,00:41:29,"They were very hard to come by, partly because butchers"
00:41:29,00:41:31,could not be bothered to collect.
00:41:31,00:41:33,"You know, each sheep has one kycom,"
00:41:33,00:41:35,"so that's one potential condom per sheep,"
00:41:35,00:41:37,"and it was just not worth collecting, basically."
00:41:37,00:41:40,So people would just use the sheep instead.
00:41:40,00:41:46,Do you know what the first condom in literature
00:41:46,00:41:49,"was used by the wife of King Minus of Crete,"
00:41:49,00:41:51,"who's called Pacifi,"
00:41:51,00:41:54,and she used it to stop herself being harmed
00:41:54,00:41:56,"by King Minus' semen,"
00:41:56,00:41:59,because it contains scorpions and serpents.
00:41:59,00:42:01,Oh.
00:42:01,00:42:02,Yeah.
00:42:02,00:42:04,"Maybe we could just watch something tonight, actually."
00:42:04,00:42:06,"Maybe, um..."
00:42:06,00:42:09,"Let's watch another episode, actually."
00:42:09,00:42:10,"Yeah, yeah."
00:42:10,00:42:11,"Actually, think about it now. Yeah."
00:42:11,00:42:14,I discovered that there's a condom make in China
00:42:14,00:42:16,"called ""Jisbon,"""
00:42:16,00:42:18,which...
00:42:18,00:42:20,"which is called ""Jisbon,"""
00:42:20,00:42:23,because it's after James Bond.
00:42:23,00:42:25,"No, the name's Bond."
00:42:25,00:42:27,-Jisbon. -Jisbon. Yeah.
00:42:27,00:42:33,"In 2006, a German entrepreneur launched a spray on condom."
00:42:33,00:42:35,-Yes. -Did you come across that?
00:42:35,00:42:37,"-Yes. -Yeah, but it was stopped by..."
00:42:37,00:42:40,"Yeah, the phrasing was a bit unfortunate there."
00:42:40,00:42:43,-Did you come across that out there? -Yeah.
00:42:43,00:42:49,And it was stopped short by EU regulations.
00:42:49,00:42:52,"Oh, I read something slightly different about what stopped it."
00:42:52,00:42:54,"So he was called Jan Klauser,"
00:42:54,00:42:57,"and he got the idea for it in a car wash,"
00:42:57,00:42:59,"because he, you know, he was..."
00:42:59,00:43:01,I don't know if he must have been in the car
00:43:01,00:43:03,"and it was just being sprayed, and he thought,"
00:43:03,00:43:05,"""Oh, maybe. If I... If you, you know,"
00:43:05,00:43:07,"""your penis is the car, as it were,"
00:43:07,00:43:09,"""and you spray it from every angle with the latex,"
00:43:09,00:43:11,"""then you have a perfectly fitted condom."""
00:43:11,00:43:13,"-Right. -You know, perfectly fitted every time."
00:43:13,00:43:16,"And he got 30 men to test it,"
00:43:16,00:43:18,and apparently it had exclusively positive reviews.
00:43:18,00:43:20,It went really well.
00:43:20,00:43:22,"But the drawbacks were that it was quite cold,"
00:43:22,00:43:25,"very cold to be just sprayed with this sort of latex liquid,"
00:43:25,00:43:27,and it takes two full minutes to dry.
00:43:27,00:43:29,-To try. -Yeah.
00:43:29,00:43:32,But which side is probably not the right size anymore?
00:43:32,00:43:34,Yeah.
00:43:34,00:43:36,"It still ships internationally, though."
00:43:36,00:43:38,-Does it? -So it's still not approved by the FDA.
00:43:38,00:43:40,"-It's still for sale? -Oh, no, that's the galactic cap."
00:43:40,00:43:42,-Sorry. -What's that?
00:43:42,00:43:45,"The galactic cap. Sorry, that's just titchy-titchy,"
00:43:45,00:43:47,like a beanie for your penis.
00:43:47,00:43:49,"Oh, OK. What, like a hipster?"
00:43:49,00:43:51,"-Yeah, a hipster one. -What?"
00:43:51,00:43:53,"Leaving the shaft. It's not been approved by the FDA,"
00:43:53,00:43:55,but it does ship internationally.
00:43:55,00:43:57,"-Ah, OK. -I don't know how it stays on."
00:43:57,00:44:00,"Right, OK. It's very exciting."
00:44:00,00:44:04,You mentioned China earlier with the James Bond thing.
00:44:04,00:44:07,"I was reading about ancient Chinese contraception,"
00:44:07,00:44:10,"and because in the early days, there was, you know,"
00:44:10,00:44:12,"there was a story that tortoise shell,"
00:44:12,00:44:15,"in the same way that the beanie was used, was kind of used for..."
00:44:15,00:44:18,"I know, it doesn't quite make sense, and you can't get any further with it."
00:44:18,00:44:20,"And, like, full disclosure,"
00:44:20,00:44:23,"the article I got this from used the word ""dude"" a lot,"
00:44:23,00:44:26,so I don't know how reliable
00:44:26,00:44:27,this is.
00:44:27,00:44:30,"Were you on the scientific journal ""Rab Monthly""?"
00:44:30,00:44:32,"-Yeah, yeah, yeah. -That is fine."
00:44:32,00:44:34,"No, no, this was... 'Cause weirdly, it has sources,"
00:44:34,00:44:36,but it's saying that there used to be a thing
00:44:36,00:44:39,"where you were told to reserve ejaculation,"
00:44:39,00:44:41,"so that basically is with, you know,"
00:44:41,00:44:43,"coitus interrupters, right?"
00:44:43,00:44:45,But the other thing that they said was
00:44:45,00:44:50,"to move the semen back into you, basically."
00:44:50,00:44:52,So that was a method that was taught.
00:44:52,00:44:55,"So the method was, as point of ejaculation was happening,"
00:44:55,00:44:58,"to press a thumb against, in between,"
00:44:58,00:45:01,"the scrotum and the anus, and what it would do was..."
00:45:01,00:45:03,My parents are in tonight.
00:45:03,00:45:07,"You're kidding, this happens every time."
00:45:07,00:45:09,"Oh, no, okay, right."
00:45:09,00:45:12,It's 'cause you mention it in every show we do.
00:45:12,00:45:14,So why don't you stick your thumb?
00:45:14,00:45:16,"So you put your thumb between your scrotum and your anus,"
00:45:16,00:45:18,"and you push, and then it's..."
00:45:18,00:45:20,The idea is that it redirects...
00:45:20,00:45:23,Middle-playing the hokey-cokey with you.
00:45:23,00:45:27,It redirects the semen to go up the spine
00:45:27,00:45:32,through the chakras and into the brain is the idea.
00:45:32,00:45:34,Because sex...
00:45:34,00:45:37,"I'm sorry, is there a tangible benefit to this procedure?"
00:45:37,00:45:39,What's that you haven't said?
00:45:39,00:45:41,Because there's an idea that you're expelling something
00:45:41,00:45:43,"from your body which is energy,"
00:45:43,00:45:45,and unless you were receiving the other energy from the human
00:45:45,00:45:47,"that you were having sex with, that was a wasted energy."
00:45:47,00:45:49,So why not losing your essence?
00:45:49,00:45:52,"Exactly. Again, from somewhere that says awesome a lot"
00:45:52,00:45:55,"in the article, and I don't know if it's legit,"
00:45:55,00:45:58,but it seemed legit at the time.
00:45:58,00:46:04,"I find that really scary, that the penis can suck things..."
00:46:04,00:46:06,suck things in.
00:46:06,00:46:09,I don't know if it can. I don't know if it can.
00:46:09,00:46:12,"I mean, they've got a problem. People are stopping using them."
00:46:12,00:46:15,So we've got the highest syphilis and gonorrhea rates
00:46:15,00:46:18,"in the UK for years and years, and there was a study done"
00:46:18,00:46:21,"about men who believe they're attractive,"
00:46:21,00:46:24,"who rate their attractiveness high,"
00:46:24,00:46:27,are much less likely to use a condom.
00:46:27,00:46:29,Really? Yeah.
00:46:29,00:46:32,"Well, that explains why I've got three on right now."
00:46:32,00:46:39,"How'd you enjoy that one, Mr and Mrs Murray?"
00:46:39,00:46:48,You can also use condoms as a bungee rope.
00:46:48,00:46:51,What? How much weight can they take?
00:46:51,00:46:53,Short bungee.
00:46:53,00:46:56,"They can take the weight of Carlo Mosca Donioso,"
00:46:56,00:46:59,who did a 30-metre bungee jump using a string
00:46:59,00:47:02,"of 18,500 condoms."
00:47:02,00:47:04,Which brand?
00:47:04,00:47:06,Yeah.
00:47:06,00:47:08,They didn't snap.
00:47:08,00:47:11,It took him four months to tie them together.
00:47:11,00:47:13,Slippery.
00:47:13,00:47:16,"Well, that's what he said. The condoms are slippery."
00:47:16,00:47:19,"If you tied a knot, it would just slip out."
00:47:19,00:47:22,The testing you'd have to do on that rope to be confident of it.
00:47:22,00:47:25,"Yeah, well, you know what? They used mathematical formulas"
00:47:25,00:47:28,to work out how strong it would have to be.
00:47:28,00:47:31,So they worked out how many they would need using maths
00:47:31,00:47:34,rather than using applied stuff.
00:47:34,00:47:37,"But he did say he was 99% sure it would work,"
00:47:37,00:47:40,but his stomach was in the knot for a month before the jump.
00:47:40,00:47:43,"But it worked, and he did manage to do it."
00:47:43,00:47:46,"So, he's one of those guys who's been in condoms in the States."
00:47:46,00:47:49,It's a brand in South America.
00:47:49,00:47:52,"They have, because they've got a guy there who's like"
00:47:52,00:47:55,"the great, you know, the Steve Jobs of condoms, basically."
00:47:55,00:47:58,"Like, he came into the company, he's innovated,"
00:47:58,00:48:01,he's made them thinner than ever before.
00:48:01,00:48:04,"He's one of those guys who's just like constantly,"
00:48:04,00:48:07,and so when they have an invention that's gone through
00:48:07,00:48:10,"the science side of it, kind of like this bungee,"
00:48:10,00:48:13,"they have these big couples who are known as the bedroom panel,"
00:48:13,00:48:15,and the condoms get given to them.
00:48:15,00:48:17,"So once or twice a month, they'll get given"
00:48:17,00:48:19,a sort of new condom test design.
00:48:19,00:48:22,Twice a month? The deviants.
00:48:22,00:48:27,"It's a whole other world, isn't it?"
00:48:27,00:48:31,"One for witsom tide, one for mickleness, and you're fine."
00:48:31,00:48:34,"They're slightly smaller Trojans, aren't they, apparently?"
00:48:34,00:48:37,"Oh, are they? Apparently, yes."
00:48:37,00:48:40,"Well, I read that on the internet today, dude."
00:48:40,00:48:43,"I also read, like, the flavours were just blew my mind."
00:48:43,00:48:46,"OK, what are they? There's a penis-flavoured condom."
00:48:46,00:48:55,Are you sure you're wearing a condom?
00:48:55,00:48:57,"Yeah, it's penis-flavoured."
00:48:57,00:49:06,"OK, that is it."
00:49:06,00:49:08,And there's all of our facts.
