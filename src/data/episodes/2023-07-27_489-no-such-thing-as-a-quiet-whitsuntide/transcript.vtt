00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:07.600
 Hi everyone, welcome to this week's episode of No Such Things as a Fish, where we were joined in the Soho Theatre London by the

00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:10.000
 incredible Sally Phillips.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:18.080
 Now a lot of you will be excited by that, I'm sure because Sally has been on the podcast a couple of times now and she is so funny.

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:22.320
 She is just one of us really. She loves doing the research. She loves facts.

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:27.760
 Just for anyone who doesn't know who Sally is, she is basically the doyen of

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:35.200
 British comedy over the last however many years. She was in Smack the Pony, she was in Alan Partridge,

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:38.080
 she played the Prime Minister of Finland in Veep.

00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:43.600
 I mean, she's been in everything. You know who Sally Phillips is. You're really going to enjoy this show.

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:48.160
 I don't really have much more to say, so I might as well quickly say don't forget to join Club Fish.

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:54.800
 If you want to, go to notionsthingasofish.com/patreon or notionsthingasofish.com/apple if you want to do that.

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:59.040
 Loads of bonus material, ad-free episodes, all sorts of stuff on there. A few weeks ago,

00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:02.560
 we gave away a cabbage patch doll and actually that reminds me,

00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:07.520
 once you've listened to this show, do go on to our various social medias because you will be able to see

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:15.360
 a couple of props that were used in this show. I'm sure we'll post them up, so definitely go and check those out because they're absolutely brilliant.

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:20.320
 Look, I don't want to use up any more of your time. I'm just going to say on with the podcast!

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:37.120
 [Music]

00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:39.120
 Oh, nice!

00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:49.600
 Hello and welcome to another episode and no such thing as a fish, a weekly podcast this week!

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:53.280
 Coming to you live from Soho Theatre!

00:01:53.280 --> 00:02:02.720
 My name is Dan Schreiber. I am sitting here with James Harkin, Andrew Hunter Murray and Sally Phillips.

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:10.320
 And once again, we have gathered around the microphones with our four favorite facts from the last seven days and in no particular order, here we go.

00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:13.280
 Starting with fact number one, and that is Sally.

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:24.240
 So, I was entranced by the Finnish Hobby Horse Championships that was doing the round on Twitter and also I was in Finland when they were being held, unfortunately didn't make it.

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:35.440
 But my fact is that the world's best hobby horse jumper can jump high enough to theoretically clear the first two jumps in the Grand National.

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:46.720
 It's amazing how many of you saw it. It was really amazing. The Hobby Horse Championships, it's mainly girls between 11 and 18 there.

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:48.400
 Okay, and is it one?

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:49.360
 You can't afford a wheel horse.

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:51.520
 It's on BBC One, like where are they?

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:58.480
 The girls are horribly bullied by their compatriots for being into, yeah, there was a film called Hobby Horse Revolution.

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:08.000
 2019. It's a big thing, it's like once you look into it, and it is some boys but mainly girls and some adult women,

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:13.760
 but I think that's a bit strange. They often go into Woodland and do it in secret.

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:17.760
 So they don't give away their moves or?

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:20.400
 No, so they don't get attacked.

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:31.440
 And they start off, most people make their own hobby horses because a pro hobby horse costs about 300 euros.

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:34.400
 And the bridle is...

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:36.720
 We're talking about the stick with the head of the horse.

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:40.400
 Yeah, so it's the realism that's the expansiveness, is it?

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:43.040
 Or are they like, is it like Nimbus 2000.

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:50.080
 I don't know, I don't know, but my partner and I, because we knew this was live and we love the show very much,

00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:55.120
 this afternoon spent a full 15 minutes each making everyone a hobby horse.

00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:55.600
 What?

00:03:55.600 --> 00:03:56.160
 No way.

00:03:56.160 --> 00:03:58.960
 What?

00:03:58.960 --> 00:04:03.040
 Oh my God.

00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:05.200
 What?

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:14.160
 So Andy, for the people who can't see this, for the people who can't see this, bad luck because it's indescribable.

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:14.960
 It is incredible.

00:04:14.960 --> 00:04:15.680
 This is amazing.

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:19.200
 Yours does look a tiny bit like a bad date night, girls.

00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:27.440
 Mine is, it's a very colourful sock, which is stuffed and it has a mop hair and some eyes.

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:28.720
 And yeah, I love it.

00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:29.280
 And yours?

00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:29.680
 Thank you so much.

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:33.760
 Mine is ultra realistic, I would say. This is a horse.

00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:37.520
 Yeah, mine slightly looks like he ran out of materials and gave up.

00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:41.680
 Yours is very cool, it's very kind of like space horse.

00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:48.080
 Mine's very space, like a glam rock, sort of, this hair is like very, let's zeppelin for the year three.

00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:51.200
 I'd say I did that one, I'm quite pleased with that one.

00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:56.080
 And this one's made out of bandages, a planta and it's got radishes for eyes.

00:04:56.080 --> 00:05:00.080
 Oh wow, this is incredible, this is incredible.

00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:06.240
 Well, I thought, I mean, I kind of thought we could maybe have a go, but that would be too embarrassing, wouldn't it?

00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:08.800
 Well, maybe we should get the audience to have a go, do a bit of dressage.

00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:13.600
 Because what would happen is there would be loads of different disciplines.

00:05:13.600 --> 00:05:17.040
 Everyone's putting it down, don't make me do it, don't make me do it.

00:05:17.040 --> 00:05:19.600
 I'm a geek, I don't like physical action.

00:05:19.600 --> 00:05:22.160
 Yeah, they do show jumping, they do puissance,

00:05:22.160 --> 00:05:28.880
 which is the only time you're allowed to run at a jump with, you're allowed to run at it rather than canter.

00:05:29.440 --> 00:05:34.400
 And yeah, that is the one where they've jumped a whole Peter Dinklage.

00:05:34.400 --> 00:05:36.720
 Oh, is that how tall Peter is?

00:05:36.720 --> 00:05:39.520
 Four foot seven inches, four foot seven inches.

00:05:39.520 --> 00:05:43.040
 But there's also, you know, show jumping, they do,

00:05:43.040 --> 00:05:45.600
 the international is 80 centimetres, the jumps.

00:05:45.600 --> 00:05:50.960
 But the fins so dominate that their jumps are one metre, 10 centimetres.

00:05:50.960 --> 00:05:51.600
 Wow.

00:05:51.600 --> 00:05:55.040
 So 10,000 hobby horses in Finland, in Finland alone.

00:05:55.040 --> 00:05:55.920
 That's incredible.

00:05:55.920 --> 00:05:58.240
 But it's spreading, it's a reason I don't know.

00:05:58.240 --> 00:06:01.840
 But is there a reason it hasn't got further or that it's so finished?

00:06:01.840 --> 00:06:03.120
 It's got quite far.

00:06:03.120 --> 00:06:03.680
 Right, okay.

00:06:03.680 --> 00:06:06.880
 It has actually got quite, it's got so much further than you'd think.

00:06:06.880 --> 00:06:11.520
 All the Nordic nations, Canada, Ukraine.

00:06:11.520 --> 00:06:12.800
 Yeah, yeah, it's in so many places, but sometimes it's...

00:06:12.800 --> 00:06:14.400
 It's quite northern, isn't it?

00:06:14.400 --> 00:06:17.360
 It's quite a north, northern Europe and Canada,

00:06:17.360 --> 00:06:20.320
 like places where you have long, dark nights with not much else to do.

00:06:20.320 --> 00:06:21.280
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:06:21.280 --> 00:06:23.520
 Well, you say that, you say that.

00:06:23.520 --> 00:06:29.600
 But I mean, at least they're nice to the horses in the Nordic nations,

00:06:29.600 --> 00:06:33.680
 whereas our pretend horses have a dark, dark history.

00:06:33.680 --> 00:06:34.320
 Right.

00:06:34.320 --> 00:06:35.840
 I'm talking about the...

00:06:35.840 --> 00:06:38.800
 None of you came across that, the Padstow, Obi-Wanstow.

00:06:38.800 --> 00:06:39.520
 Oh, the Obi-Wanstow.

00:06:39.520 --> 00:06:42.400
 Yeah, but the scariest one is in Wales.

00:06:42.400 --> 00:06:46.480
 In Wales, they use real horse skulls on a stick.

00:06:46.480 --> 00:06:47.120
 Really?

00:06:47.120 --> 00:06:47.680
 Yeah, we're...

00:06:47.680 --> 00:06:50.640
 This isn't teenage girls doing it, though, is it?

00:06:50.640 --> 00:06:52.720
 Well, the video I saw...

00:06:52.720 --> 00:06:53.680
 It's like ghost horse.

00:06:53.680 --> 00:06:56.160
 Elderly man, go with some friends,

00:06:56.160 --> 00:07:00.080
 goes to the door of someone's house,

00:07:00.080 --> 00:07:04.000
 and then sings quite a scary song in Welsh.

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:07.760
 And if you cannot finish the song inside the house,

00:07:07.760 --> 00:07:09.280
 they force their way in.

00:07:09.280 --> 00:07:09.760
 Okay.

00:07:09.760 --> 00:07:12.640
 And there's a lot of chasing girls with horses and...

00:07:12.640 --> 00:07:14.880
 It's all sort of strange folky rituals, isn't it?

00:07:14.880 --> 00:07:16.720
 Very strange folky rituals, yeah.

00:07:16.720 --> 00:07:18.400
 But there are loads of these rituals all over the place.

00:07:18.400 --> 00:07:18.720
 Yeah, it's all over the place.

00:07:18.720 --> 00:07:19.920
 Okay, there's the...

00:07:19.920 --> 00:07:21.920
 You said Padstow, which is another one.

00:07:21.920 --> 00:07:23.120
 There's the Hoden horse in Ken.

00:07:23.120 --> 00:07:24.640
 Did you see the Padstow?

00:07:24.640 --> 00:07:25.760
 Did you look at that online?

00:07:25.760 --> 00:07:26.240
 Yeah, I did.

00:07:26.240 --> 00:07:26.800
 It doesn't look...

00:07:26.800 --> 00:07:27.840
 I mean, it's really bizarre.

00:07:27.840 --> 00:07:29.600
 It looks like a grand piano.

00:07:29.600 --> 00:07:30.560
 Oh, really?

00:07:30.560 --> 00:07:32.560
 But with a tail and things sticking out the front,

00:07:32.560 --> 00:07:33.840
 then they sort of rock it.

00:07:33.840 --> 00:07:34.800
 Yeah, they're kind of a bit rich.

00:07:34.800 --> 00:07:35.440
 Very strange.

00:07:35.440 --> 00:07:38.960
 Is this where the pantomime horse comes from?

00:07:38.960 --> 00:07:39.120
 No.

00:07:39.120 --> 00:07:41.280
 Because these are really weird sort of ritual,

00:07:41.280 --> 00:07:43.040
 fertility things, but it's nothing to do with the pantomime.

00:07:43.040 --> 00:07:44.640
 No, nothing to do with the pantomime horse.

00:07:44.640 --> 00:07:45.360
 Maybe a bit.

00:07:45.360 --> 00:07:46.800
 Well, no, it's really strange.

00:07:46.800 --> 00:07:48.560
 It's the Lord of Misrules.

00:07:48.560 --> 00:07:50.080
 So it's the spirit of...

00:07:50.080 --> 00:07:51.920
 Well, that's what Google told me.

00:07:51.920 --> 00:07:53.200
 Well, what is it?

00:07:53.200 --> 00:07:54.320
 I'm talking like I've got...

00:07:54.320 --> 00:07:55.200
 What is the pantomime horse?

00:07:55.200 --> 00:07:57.840
 But a kind of, you know, that's a sort of misrule thing,

00:07:57.840 --> 00:07:58.400
 isn't it?

00:07:58.400 --> 00:07:59.440
 You know, it's unnatural.

00:07:59.440 --> 00:07:59.520
 The pantomime horse.

00:07:59.520 --> 00:08:00.160
 It's weird.

00:08:00.160 --> 00:08:01.200
 Yes, so...

00:08:01.200 --> 00:08:03.040
 Who's in the front? Who's in the back?

00:08:03.040 --> 00:08:03.680
 Yeah.

00:08:03.680 --> 00:08:04.160
 No?

00:08:04.160 --> 00:08:04.560
 No one...

00:08:04.560 --> 00:08:05.840
 Yeah, I always feel that's the...

00:08:05.840 --> 00:08:08.000
 You would get on really well with Kate Beckinsale.

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:08.720
 Did you see this?

00:08:08.720 --> 00:08:09.360
 Oh, really?

00:08:09.360 --> 00:08:11.280
 She travels with the pantomime horse everywhere.

00:08:11.280 --> 00:08:11.840
 She does.

00:08:11.840 --> 00:08:12.400
 Yeah.

00:08:12.400 --> 00:08:14.160
 And she reckons it's like really good.

00:08:14.160 --> 00:08:16.400
 Well, it kind of calms her down as she's stressed.

00:08:16.400 --> 00:08:18.000
 Wait, sorry, with people in it?

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:20.000
 Well, does she...?

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:24.000
 Like an emotional support animal.

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:26.000
 She brings the costume around,

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:28.000
 and then if she's got a bit of downtime,

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:30.000
 then she'll get in it and she'll find someone else

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:31.280
 to get in it with her.

00:08:31.280 --> 00:08:34.000
 And it's just a nice way of calming down, relaxing and...

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:38.000
 Yes, very normal.

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:40.000
 I think the biggest problem on the sort of a PR level

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:42.000
 is that no matter how you try and spin it,

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:44.000
 it always sounds nuts when you say the thing

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:46.000
 you're actually doing with hobby horsing.

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:48.000
 Like, I found a quote from someone who said,

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:50.000
 "People assume that it's a game

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:53.000
 or that we are more or less crazy,"

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:58.000
 said Chairwoman of the Finnish Stick Horse Enthusiast Association.

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:01.000
 You're never going to make it past the description, are you?

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:02.000
 It's a hard thing.

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:04.000
 But it sounds like an amazing...

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:06.000
 I genuinely think, you know, people always talk about

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:08.000
 at the Olympics, like, why not have someone in the 100 meters

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:11.000
 who's just a citizen who's just running alongside

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:13.000
 and you can really see how fast they're going,

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:15.000
 having a 12-year-old girl at the Grand National,

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:18.000
 make the first two and just stack it

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:20.000
 head first until the third.

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:21.000
 That would be amazing.

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:24.000
 Actually, imagine you had a pantomime horse,

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:27.000
 the fastest pantomime horse in the world.

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:28.000
 Yeah.

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:30.000
 And they are in the 100 meters.

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:32.000
 You know it's a person, right?

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:35.000
 Well, two people, and they're in the 100 meters

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:37.000
 in the first-ever Olympics.

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:38.000
 Yeah.

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:39.000
 Where do you think they would finish?

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:41.000
 So, in the first ever...

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:43.000
 The first-ever Olympics 100 meters race,

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:46.000
 you've got the two fastest current pantomime horse people.

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:47.000
 Yeah.

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:49.000
 Where would they finish in the race?

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:51.000
 Because people did run a bit slower, didn't they,

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:52.000
 in the first Olympics?

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:55.000
 Yeah, but they didn't have a pantomime horse costume on.

00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:56.000
 Why? I just...

00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:58.000
 Well, the first Olympics, that was Greece.

00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:00.000
 It was just, like, ancient Greece.

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:02.000
 Oh, no, sorry, in 1996.

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:03.000
 The first modern Olympics.

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:04.000
 Right, first modern.

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:06.000
 Just shoes were less good then, and they hadn't...

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:07.000
 You know...

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:09.000
 Maybe someone died in the right race.

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:10.000
 Oh, OK.

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:13.000
 Honestly, it's just a straight-up question.

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:14.000
 I'm going to say bronze.

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:15.000
 I'm going to say bronze.

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:17.000
 But, no, no, I'm going to say silver and bronze,

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:19.000
 because they count as two people.

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:20.000
 Very clever. Very clever.

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:21.000
 Yeah.

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:23.000
 I'm going to say gold.

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:24.000
 No, well, Dan is right.

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:25.000
 They would have got silver.

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:30.000
 The fastest is 12.045 seconds for 100 meters,

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:33.000
 and that wouldn't quite have gotten gold in the first Olympics,

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:34.000
 but it would have been the second place.

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:38.000
 Does the nose of the person in the back of the pantomime horse

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:39.000
 have to get over the line?

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:40.000
 No, no, OK.

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:41.000
 OK.

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:42.000
 Just the front.

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:43.000
 That's amazing.

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:44.000
 Can I go back to hobby-horsing,

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:46.000
 just because it's one fact I'm just so desperate to share?

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:47.000
 Yeah.

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:50.000
 One of the rules of the hobby-horse competition

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:53.000
 is that only stallions and mares can take part

00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:55.000
 and geldings are banned.

00:10:55.000 --> 00:11:00.000
 Gelding.

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:01.000
 Gelding being a...

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:02.000
 What have you made of that?

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:03.000
 A muted young horse.

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:04.000
 Where are the testicles on this thing?

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:06.000
 Well, that's what I mean.

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:07.000
 They're all geldings.

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:08.000
 That's what I mean.

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:09.000
 Yeah, well, exactly.

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:10.000
 That's bizarre, isn't it?

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:11.000
 But that's in the rules.

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:12.000
 That's amazing.

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:13.000
 Incredible.

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:14.000
 Pantomime horses.

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:15.000
 I mean, that is the worst ever job.

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:16.000
 Have you ever done that?

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:17.000
 No, I've never done that.

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:18.000
 I've never done that.

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:19.000
 I've never done that.

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:22.000
 There were some pantomimes that sometimes used real horses.

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:23.000
 Right.

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:27.000
 Because John Barrowman was thrown 20 foot off by one.

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:30.000
 They supposedly trained horses, they threw him off.

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:32.000
 In Glasgow in 2013.

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:33.000
 And there was a...

00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:35.000
 Paul O'Grady always used to tell a story

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:37.000
 about being in a panto with a trained horse

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:39.000
 that he had to get into bed with him.

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:40.000
 He used to follow him around.

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:42.000
 He was playing the fairy godmother in Cinderella.

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:46.000
 He used to follow him around the stage with a massive erection.

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:49.000
 And he couldn't...

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:53.000
 He couldn't say anything because there was loads and loads of kids.

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:56.000
 And they're all going, "It's behind you!"

00:11:56.000 --> 00:12:00.000
 Oh, wow.

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:01.000
 Good grief.

00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:02.000
 That's pretty good.

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:04.000
 Here's the thing about real horses now.

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:05.000
 Yeah.

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:06.000
 If you...

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:07.000
 I don't think we've said this before.

00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:13.000
 If you frown at a horse and then go away and then come back,

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:19.000
 it will remember and be a bit more...

00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:23.000
 James is doing some stunt work for the people listening at home.

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:25.000
 It'll remember that you frown at home.

00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:26.000
 It'll remember that you frown at home.

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:28.000
 But also if you smile at a horse and then go away,

00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:30.000
 it will think, "Oh, there he is."

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:32.000
 The horse remembers you frowned.

00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:34.000
 How is it then passing that data on?

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:35.000
 Exactly.

00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:36.000
 So it's bizarre.

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:38.000
 It's which eye it looks at you with.

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:39.000
 Oh.

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:42.000
 So horses look at negative or threatening sites with their left eye

00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:44.000
 and positive ones with their right eye.

00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:45.000
 Really?

00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:47.000
 So if you come back, you know what the horse thinks of you,

00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:49.000
 depending on which eye it looks at you with.

00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:50.000
 That's really interesting.

00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:53.000
 So horses understand human facial expressions.

00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:54.000
 Yeah.

00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:56.000
 It's interesting because a lot of animals, if you smile at them,

00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:59.000
 they'll see the teeth and they think you're being aggressive,

00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:00.000
 for instance.

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:01.000
 Right.

00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:02.000
 So interesting.

00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:03.000
 Yeah.

00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:07.000
 Yeah.

00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:10.000
 Do you know that it was illegal to dress up as a horse in Scotland

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:12.000
 in the 7th century?

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:13.000
 Really?

00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:14.000
 Yeah.

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:18.000
 In fact, it was forbidden for any man to dress as a horse

00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:23.000
 or a wild beast and dance anti-clockwise during January.

00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:24.000
 Yeah.

00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:25.000
 It was demonic.

00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:28.000
 Well, that's the thing about dressing up as an animal

00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:31.000
 was to let your demonic side out.

00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:32.000
 Yeah.

00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:33.000
 Yeah, absolutely.

00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:35.000
 It was seen as very anti-Catholic and stuff.

00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:39.000
 St Augustine wrote that anyone carrying on that most filthy

00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:43.000
 practice of dressing like a horse should be punished most severely.

00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:44.000
 Oh, wow.

00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:48.000
 But as soon as the 1st of February hits, knock yourself out.

00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:52.000
 We're doing No Horse January this year again.

00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:53.000
 That's fine.

00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:02.000
 OK, it is time for fact number two.

00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:03.000
 And that is my fact.

00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:08.000
 My fact this week is that this June of 2023, the 6 millionth,

00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:16.000
 666,666 English language Wikipedia article was created.

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:19.000
 And that page was an entry for SatanCon.

00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:20.000
 Ooh.

00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:21.000
 Yeah.

00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:25.000
 You've got to imagine, obviously, that they were aiming to land that.

00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:26.000
 But that's really hard, right?

00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:28.000
 So SatanCon being--

00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:30.000
 Is that like Comic-Con but with devils?

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:31.000
 It pretty much is.

00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:35.000
 Yeah, it's set up by the Satanic Temple, who are a non-theistic

00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:38.000
 organization, and they have this annual convention.

00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:39.000
 It was in Boston this year.

00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:41.000
 It was on April 28th, which is my birthday.

00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:43.000
 So that's very exciting.

00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:44.000
 Congratulations.

00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:45.000
 Thank you very much.

00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:47.000
 It's quite new, SatanCon.

00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:49.000
 I think it's only been held twice, I think.

00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:53.000
 So this year was in Boston at the Boston Marriott Hotel.

00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:56.000
 So good on the Marriott, because you would think,

00:14:56.000 --> 00:15:00.000
 oh, maybe there'll be a reputational concern if we host SatanCon.

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:02.000
 But they said, no, you come and have the conference here.

00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:04.000
 And I think that's really good.

00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:07.000
 Because, no, but the first one got lots of placards

00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:10.000
 and it got lots of protests outside SatanCon 1,

00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:13.000
 you know, in 2022, denouncing Satan and this sort of thing.

00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:17.000
 Even though the Satanic Temple, they don't believe in Satan.

00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:18.000
 They don't--

00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:19.000
 They say they lie.

00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:20.000
 That's the point.

00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:22.000
 That is the point of Satan.

00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:23.000
 Yeah, really good point.

00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:24.000
 Yeah.

00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:25.000
 Oh, that's worry.

00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:28.000
 Because they do run Satan Afterschool Clubs.

00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:32.000
 And I was thinking of my kids.

00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:34.000
 And even if they--

00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:36.000
 Even if they don't believe in Satan,

00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:38.000
 they're not helping themselves by calling themselves

00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:39.000
 the Satanic Temple, are they?

00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:40.000
 No.

00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:43.000
 They're sort of more of a free speech organization, really.

00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:44.000
 That's what they say, Andy.

00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:45.000
 But no, you're right.

00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:46.000
 It's all such a good point.

00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:47.000
 You're being sucked in.

00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:48.000
 Oh, God, I've fallen right for it.

00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:50.000
 Satan Prince of Lies, that's his name.

00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:53.000
 Why did I get this pentagram tattooed on my back?

00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:56.000
 [LAUGHTER]

00:15:56.000 --> 00:16:00.000
 They use the proper Latin greeting instead of saying Hail Satan,

00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:01.000
 who they don't believe in.

00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:03.000
 I'm really on the temple side.

00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:05.000
 They say Ave Satana.

00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:06.000
 What's that mean?

00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:07.000
 Hail Satan.

00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:08.000
 Hail Satan.

00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:14.000
 [LAUGHTER]

00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:15.000
 Yeah.

00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:18.000
 But it scans the same as have a banana, which I really like.

00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:19.000
 Ave Satana.

00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:20.000
 That's how you can remember it.

00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:21.000
 Yeah, yeah.

00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:22.000
 I like it.

00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:23.000
 I think they're good.

00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:24.000
 Oh, do you?

00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:25.000
 Yeah, they're kind of rationalistic.

00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:27.000
 Well, there's a few of them around down there who claim to not be

00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:30.000
 interested in Satan, but are called the Church of Satan or whatever.

00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:31.000
 Yeah.

00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:32.000
 Yeah.

00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:34.000
 And a lot of them are like just trying to take the piss out

00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:37.000
 of the government, out of the church, out of all that kind of stuff.

00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:38.000
 Yeah.

00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:41.000
 In lockdown, I started presenting a religious program

00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:44.000
 on Sunday mornings called Sunday Morning Live.

00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:48.000
 And we, under the BBC, had to interview every religion

00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:49.000
 that's recognized as a religion.

00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:50.000
 Oh.

00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:53.000
 I didn't actually do it, but they interviewed the Satanists.

00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:54.000
 Really?

00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:55.000
 After--

00:16:55.000 --> 00:16:56.000
 Oh.

00:16:56.000 --> 00:16:58.000
 Is that like a proper religion then in the UK?

00:16:58.000 --> 00:16:59.000
 Yeah.

00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:00.000
 All right.

00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:01.000
 Yeah, Wiccan.

00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:02.000
 Wiccan, yeah.

00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:04.000
 And the lady who came, I didn't talk to her, actually,

00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:05.000
 but she came.

00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:06.000
 She'd been up all night.

00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:07.000
 [LAUGHTER]

00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:08.000
 Doing what?

00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:10.000
 In the woods with her horse?

00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:11.000
 Having satanic sex in the woods.

00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:12.000
 No.

00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:13.000
 Basically, yeah.

00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:18.000
 And the big issue for Sunday Morning Live was that she wasn't wearing a bra

00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:20.000
 and you could see really--

00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:22.000
 see her nipples really, really clearly.

00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:23.000
 Oh, wait.

00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:24.000
 Was it radio or TV?

00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:25.000
 TV.

00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:26.000
 Or three of TV.

00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:27.000
 [LAUGHTER]

00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:28.000
 So it's like, how are we going to--

00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:30.000
 Why would that story be relevant if it was radio, Andy?

00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:34.000
 [LAUGHTER]

00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:38.000
 How are we going to gaffotate the witches' nips?

00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:40.000
 [LAUGHTER]

00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:41.000
 Wow.

00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:42.000
 So the Wiccan thing is a bit different, yeah.

00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:43.000
 Was she satanic?

00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:45.000
 Like, did you feel that she was pushing the Satan?

00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:47.000
 I didn't particularly talk to her, no.

00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:49.000
 I think they-- yeah, no.

00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:51.000
 No, I don't-- no, I don't think so.

00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:52.000
 [LAUGHTER]

00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:53.000
 I mean, I didn't talk to--

00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:56.000
 I don't know what happened, but it's like, whatever spell she put on you,

00:17:56.000 --> 00:17:58.000
 it just suddenly kicked in.

00:17:58.000 --> 00:17:59.000
 [LAUGHTER]

00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:03.000
 Honestly, I'm a bit scared of witches and Satan.

00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:04.000
 Yeah.

00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:06.000
 So is David Bowie, so it's fine.

00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:07.000
 [LAUGHTER]

00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:08.000
 He was once exercised.

00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:12.000
 He got someone to do spells of protection.

00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:13.000
 Right.

00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:16.000
 Well, he used to collect his urine and little bottles, kind of like how Hugh Hefner

00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:18.000
 did, because he was worried that witches were going to steal them

00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:19.000
 and do black magic with them.

00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:20.000
 Oh, no.

00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:22.000
 But he would collect all of it.

00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:23.000
 What do you mean?

00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:25.000
 He kind of collected all of his urine and bottles to prevent theft.

00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:26.000
 [LAUGHTER]

00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:28.000
 Because that's such an unsustainable--

00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:29.000
 I mean, I know he was rich.

00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:30.000
 I know he was like a wealthy guy.

00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:34.000
 If someone had enough money for jars to sustain every passing of urine--

00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:36.000
 Imagine how much it would fetch now.

00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:38.000
 And I absolutely would buy some of it.

00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:39.000
 Oh, yeah, yeah, of course.

00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:42.000
 But I also think, like, if you just piss it down the toilet,

00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:45.000
 that's probably safer than keeping it in bottles in your house.

00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:46.000
 That's so much safer.

00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:47.000
 Yeah.

00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:48.000
 Yeah, it must be, right?

00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:50.000
 Because once you've got it in bottles, people--

00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:52.000
 No, but you're forgetting about filming trailers.

00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:53.000
 Because--

00:18:53.000 --> 00:18:54.000
 Oh, yeah.

00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:58.000
 Yeah, and filming-- because there was-- I think I might have made this up.

00:18:58.000 --> 00:18:59.000
 [LAUGHTER]

00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:05.000
 But I feel like there was an issue of people going to Justin Timberlake's

00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:08.000
 filming trailer and trying to steal his turrets out there.

00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:09.000
 Oh, because it's held in a tank.

00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:11.000
 Yeah, yeah, of course, yeah.

00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:12.000
 No.

00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:13.000
 Did I dream that?

00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:14.000
 [LAUGHTER]

00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:16.000
 That would be so worrying if I did.

00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:17.000
 I feel that was a thing, then.

00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:18.000
 And what were they going to do with it?

00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:19.000
 Were they going to clone it?

00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:20.000
 eBay?

00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:21.000
 All right.

00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:25.000
 No, no, just use it and use it for spells, I guess, was his--

00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:27.000
 we've got to remember that this is a guy who was so coked off his head

00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:29.000
 that he was collecting in his own piss in bottles.

00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:32.000
 I don't think there was logic to his reasoning.

00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:34.000
 I think he just was scared of a--

00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:37.000
 But there is a whole thing of collecting, you know, hairs and stuff,

00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:38.000
 isn't there?

00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:40.000
 Well, yeah, I mean, so that's a thing.

00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:43.000
 So Yoko Ono used to be seen as someone that potentially--

00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:45.000
 you know, she had an album called Yes, I Am a Witch

00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:48.000
 because she was presented as someone who might be a witch.

00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:52.000
 And she bought a single mustache hair off of Salvador Dali.

00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:55.000
 She paid him for it, and he sent it over in a box.

00:19:55.000 --> 00:19:58.000
 And years later, it was revealed by the partner of Salvador Dali

00:19:58.000 --> 00:20:01.000
 that he was so scared that she was going to use it for witchcraft

00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:04.000
 that he ended up sending a painted bit of a blade of grass

00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:06.000
 that he picked from his lawn.

00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:08.000
 But she never noticed, according to the story.

00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:10.000
 But he was petrified that Yoko Ono--

00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:13.000
 Yeah, well, there was the whole satanic panic, wasn't there?

00:20:13.000 --> 00:20:15.000
 Was it '70s and '80s?

00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:17.000
 Were they thought McDonald's were haunted?

00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:18.000
 Possessed?

00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:19.000
 McDonald's?

00:20:19.000 --> 00:20:21.000
 No, the whole satanic panic where--

00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:24.000
 McDonald's got a letter from a woman in Ohio

00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:28.000
 asking why the owner, Ray Crock,

00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:30.000
 was a financial supporter of the Church of Satan.

00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:33.000
 And it was a rumor that just spread--

00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:36.000
 she said she'd seen him on the Phil Donahue show

00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:39.000
 saying he supported the Church of Satan.

00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:41.000
 And he hadn't said that.

00:20:41.000 --> 00:20:44.000
 But she told her pastor, and her pastor put it in the church's newsletter,

00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:47.000
 which was called Moments of Sunshine.

00:20:47.000 --> 00:20:52.000
 And very quickly, that spread across America

00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:54.000
 via church newsletters.

00:20:54.000 --> 00:20:57.000
 So McDonald's had to send executives out to these churches

00:20:57.000 --> 00:21:01.000
 with sworn statements insisting that Crock never said those things.

00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:03.000
 It was a real panic, wasn't it?

00:21:03.000 --> 00:21:07.000
 And the expert on it these days is a guy called Dr. David Frankfurter.

00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:12.000
 And what he thinks is it was basically like a sort of a loop

00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:15.000
 where you would have these evangelical Christians saying,

00:21:15.000 --> 00:21:16.000
 "This is happening."

00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:19.000
 And then people were using hypnotic regression techniques

00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:24.000
 to try and remember things that they supposedly suppressed in their lives.

00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:26.000
 And then really what they would do is kind of say

00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:28.000
 what the hypnotists wanted them to say.

00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:30.000
 You just had this kind of feedback loop

00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:33.000
 that eventually there was, in theory, in some of the newspapers they were saying,

00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:36.000
 there were thousands of these Satanists around America doing this.

00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:37.000
 Yeah.

00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:39.000
 I've got a fact for you.

00:21:39.000 --> 00:21:40.000
 Okay.

00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:45.000
 In 2021, in the UK, more babies were named Lucifer than Nigel.

00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:47.000
 Do you have the numbers? Do we know how many?

00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:48.000
 15 Lucifers?

00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:49.000
 Yeah.

00:21:49.000 --> 00:21:50.000
 No more than two Nigels.

00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:51.000
 No!

00:21:51.000 --> 00:21:52.000
 Oh, my word.

00:21:52.000 --> 00:21:53.000
 It doesn't appear on the list.

00:21:53.000 --> 00:21:54.000
 You know that thing where if there are under three,

00:21:54.000 --> 00:21:56.000
 they don't say how many there are.

00:21:56.000 --> 00:21:59.000
 And do we think that it's because Nigel is associated with evil these days?

00:21:59.000 --> 00:22:03.000
 [LAUGHTER]

00:22:03.000 --> 00:22:06.000
 Did you come across a thing of 666, though?

00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:07.000
 Yeah.

00:22:07.000 --> 00:22:09.000
 So I'd always thought that 666, the number of the beast,

00:22:09.000 --> 00:22:12.000
 was about the number of perfection being seven,

00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:15.000
 and so six being imperfection.

00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:17.000
 That's what I thought it was.

00:22:17.000 --> 00:22:23.000
 But then, today, I discovered that there's a thing called isosephi,

00:22:23.000 --> 00:22:25.000
 which is letters equivalent to numbers.

00:22:25.000 --> 00:22:29.000
 And apparently, this was very, very common in 1st and 2nd century CE.

00:22:29.000 --> 00:22:35.000
 So you would quite often refer to people with a number.

00:22:35.000 --> 00:22:42.000
 So a joke was, by Seatonius, a calculation knew Nero his mother slew.

00:22:42.000 --> 00:22:46.000
 And in this case, the emperor Nero equals 1005,

00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:49.000
 which is the same value as the phrase his mother slew.

00:22:49.000 --> 00:22:54.000
 And apparently, most people think if you say 666, it stands for seasonero.

00:22:54.000 --> 00:22:59.000
 So in some early versions of the Bible, in Revelations from Revelations 13,

00:22:59.000 --> 00:23:03.000
 the Latin version has the numbers being 616.

00:23:03.000 --> 00:23:04.000
 Right.

00:23:04.000 --> 00:23:08.000
 And that's because in Latin, Nero is 616, not 666.

00:23:08.000 --> 00:23:12.000
 And the reason we think that is because Revelation was written by very early Christians.

00:23:12.000 --> 00:23:15.000
 It's one of the earliest of the New Testament books.

00:23:15.000 --> 00:23:19.000
 And really, they were just being persecuted by Nero, so they saw him as the devil.

00:23:19.000 --> 00:23:25.000
 But he was actually a good guy.

00:23:25.000 --> 00:23:27.000
 Well, I wouldn't go quite that far.

00:23:27.000 --> 00:23:29.000
 I mean, it depends what side you're on.

00:23:29.000 --> 00:23:31.000
 If you're on Nero's side, he's a great guy.

00:23:31.000 --> 00:23:38.000
 He used to drink an energy drink that was made by soaking roasted dung in vinegar.

00:23:38.000 --> 00:23:42.000
 But that's still how they, that's Red Bull, that is.

00:23:42.000 --> 00:23:44.000
 Now that's Steven Seagal's energy drink.

00:23:44.000 --> 00:23:45.000
 Have you seen those adverts?

00:23:45.000 --> 00:23:46.000
 Oh, yeah.

00:23:46.000 --> 00:23:47.000
 They're unbelievable.

00:23:47.000 --> 00:23:48.000
 I've not seen the ads.

00:23:48.000 --> 00:23:49.000
 You've got to see the ads.

00:23:49.000 --> 00:23:50.000
 What are they called?

00:23:50.000 --> 00:23:51.000
 You've got to see the ads.

00:23:51.000 --> 00:23:52.000
 What's it called?

00:23:52.000 --> 00:23:53.000
 I can't remember.

00:23:53.000 --> 00:23:54.000
 I used to drink it all the time.

00:23:54.000 --> 00:23:55.000
 Steven, what?

00:23:55.000 --> 00:23:56.000
 Yeah, I don't know why.

00:23:56.000 --> 00:23:57.000
 Why?

00:23:57.000 --> 00:23:58.000
 I went through a period.

00:23:58.000 --> 00:24:01.000
 Well, my local corner shop just stocked things like Marley's Mellow Mood,

00:24:01.000 --> 00:24:03.000
 which was a Bob Marley energy drink, but it was sort of an opposite.

00:24:03.000 --> 00:24:04.000
 What?

00:24:04.000 --> 00:24:05.000
 A Bob Marley energy drink.

00:24:05.000 --> 00:24:06.000
 Yeah.

00:24:06.000 --> 00:24:08.000
 It was a sort of Bob Marley anti-energy drink.

00:24:08.000 --> 00:24:13.000
 And it said on the side, "Whatever you do, don't drive a truck after two of these."

00:24:13.000 --> 00:24:19.000
 This store, it had all the collection of every celebrity's weird...

00:24:19.000 --> 00:24:22.000
 What's amazing, Dan, is that this was at the end of your street.

00:24:22.000 --> 00:24:25.000
 You would be the only person in the world who would buy this stuff.

00:24:25.000 --> 00:24:26.000
 Yeah, exactly.

00:24:26.000 --> 00:24:27.000
 They probably only...

00:24:27.000 --> 00:24:29.000
 They were like, "Oh, we accidentally ordered this one time."

00:24:29.000 --> 00:24:32.000
 "Oh, it's selling every week for this one guy."

00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:33.000
 Let's keep getting it.

00:24:33.000 --> 00:24:34.000
 It was really powerful, his drink.

00:24:34.000 --> 00:24:35.000
 Yeah.

00:24:35.000 --> 00:24:36.000
 Yeah, the Steven Seagal one.

00:24:36.000 --> 00:24:38.000
 It's the most misogynistic advert I've ever seen.

00:24:38.000 --> 00:24:39.000
 Oh, really?

00:24:39.000 --> 00:24:41.000
 And he's not even bothered to turn up.

00:24:41.000 --> 00:24:42.000
 You just have to watch it.

00:24:42.000 --> 00:24:44.000
 Okay, that wasn't on the can.

00:24:44.000 --> 00:24:45.000
 It's awful.

00:24:45.000 --> 00:24:46.000
 It's in there.

00:24:46.000 --> 00:24:50.000
 I can't believe I was the sole funder of that ad.

00:24:50.000 --> 00:24:59.000
 It is time for fact number three, and that is Andy.

00:24:59.000 --> 00:25:04.000
 My fact is that roughly 3% of our entire planet is called Jason.

00:25:04.000 --> 00:25:08.000
 How much is called Nigel?

00:25:08.000 --> 00:25:09.000
 I'm shrinking about it.

00:25:09.000 --> 00:25:10.000
 Yeah, so this is an amazing...

00:25:10.000 --> 00:25:11.000
 Okay, this is amazing, right?

00:25:11.000 --> 00:25:15.000
 Now, this is not 3% of all people on the planet are called Jason, right?

00:25:15.000 --> 00:25:20.000
 This is 3% of the Earth itself is named Jason.

00:25:20.000 --> 00:25:21.000
 By whom?

00:25:21.000 --> 00:25:22.000
 By...

00:25:22.000 --> 00:25:23.000
 Jason?

00:25:23.000 --> 00:25:25.000
 By geologists and seismologists.

00:25:25.000 --> 00:25:26.000
 So they're...

00:25:26.000 --> 00:25:29.000
 Okay, this is a bit technical, but there are these two mysterious...

00:25:29.000 --> 00:25:31.000
 Sound like Dan when I read this out.

00:25:31.000 --> 00:25:36.000
 There are these mysterious structures inside the Earth, right?

00:25:36.000 --> 00:25:37.000
 There are two of them, okay?

00:25:37.000 --> 00:25:39.000
 And they are these massive blobs.

00:25:39.000 --> 00:25:44.000
 They're called LLSVPs, large, low shear velocity provinces, right?

00:25:44.000 --> 00:25:48.000
 Now, there's one beneath Africa and there's one under the Pacific.

00:25:48.000 --> 00:25:52.000
 And that's obviously a very technical name for them.

00:25:52.000 --> 00:25:53.000
 And they're not very well known about.

00:25:53.000 --> 00:25:59.000
 They're not very well researched because they are where the mantle of the Earth meets the core of the Earth, okay?

00:25:59.000 --> 00:26:01.000
 So the Earth goes crust, not very much.

00:26:01.000 --> 00:26:03.000
 Mantle, quite a bit.

00:26:03.000 --> 00:26:04.000
 Core, quite a bit more.

00:26:04.000 --> 00:26:08.000
 And they're at the junction point between the mantle and the core.

00:26:08.000 --> 00:26:09.000
 So they're really hard to research.

00:26:09.000 --> 00:26:13.000
 And the researchers have named them Tuzo and Jason.

00:26:13.000 --> 00:26:15.000
 They are billions of years old and between them they are...

00:26:15.000 --> 00:26:16.000
 Both blocs.

00:26:16.000 --> 00:26:19.000
 That's true.

00:26:19.000 --> 00:26:21.000
 They're named after two geological scientists.

00:26:21.000 --> 00:26:22.000
 So they are, yeah.

00:26:22.000 --> 00:26:24.000
 And we don't know what they are.

00:26:24.000 --> 00:26:28.000
 They might be offcuts from another planet, which is exciting.

00:26:28.000 --> 00:26:32.000
 There's a theoretical planet called Thea from four and a half billion years ago,

00:26:32.000 --> 00:26:36.000
 which might have crashed into Earth and might have been subsumed.

00:26:36.000 --> 00:26:37.000
 That's possible.

00:26:37.000 --> 00:26:38.000
 Right.

00:26:38.000 --> 00:26:40.000
 Yeah, we don't know exactly what they are.

00:26:40.000 --> 00:26:42.000
 But they are incredible and they're there.

00:26:42.000 --> 00:26:43.000
 And this...

00:26:43.000 --> 00:26:46.000
 I don't know why I'm having to justify their existence.

00:26:46.000 --> 00:26:47.000
 This is proper...

00:26:47.000 --> 00:26:49.000
 I just spent 15 minutes talking about Satan.

00:26:49.000 --> 00:26:53.000
 These are real geological structures in the planet.

00:26:53.000 --> 00:26:54.000
 They're awesome.

00:26:54.000 --> 00:26:56.000
 No, yeah, it was wonderful.

00:26:56.000 --> 00:27:01.000
 Why aren't you more excited?

00:27:01.000 --> 00:27:05.000
 In all honesty, it's because an eBay auction came up on my phone

00:27:05.000 --> 00:27:08.000
 saying you got three minutes to bid, so I suddenly was focused on that.

00:27:08.000 --> 00:27:09.000
 Are you joking?

00:27:09.000 --> 00:27:12.000
 I didn't bid in the end.

00:27:12.000 --> 00:27:15.000
 How much was it for that swimming pool of David Bowie's bottled urine?

00:27:15.000 --> 00:27:18.000
 Are we saying that there's...

00:27:18.000 --> 00:27:20.000
 Because the description I read is that it's...

00:27:20.000 --> 00:27:24.000
 There's mountains there that are taller than Mount Everest.

00:27:24.000 --> 00:27:25.000
 Yes.

00:27:25.000 --> 00:27:27.000
 But what does that mean?

00:27:27.000 --> 00:27:30.000
 It's not the Hollow Earth we're talking about, right?

00:27:30.000 --> 00:27:32.000
 There's no space around the mountains.

00:27:32.000 --> 00:27:33.000
 Oh!

00:27:33.000 --> 00:27:36.000
 It's just different rock that might have been this other mystery planet.

00:27:36.000 --> 00:27:41.000
 Yeah, in fact, near Jason and Tuzo, there are these enormous mega mountains

00:27:41.000 --> 00:27:43.000
 and they're at that junction point as well.

00:27:43.000 --> 00:27:47.000
 They are called ultra low velocity zones and it's this weird boundary zone.

00:27:47.000 --> 00:27:49.000
 I did read something, I can't get my head around this.

00:27:49.000 --> 00:27:53.000
 Scientists claim that the gap between the core and the mantle

00:27:53.000 --> 00:27:57.000
 is bigger than the change between rock and air.

00:27:57.000 --> 00:27:59.000
 No, I can't understand that.

00:27:59.000 --> 00:28:01.000
 It's because of the high pressure, right?

00:28:01.000 --> 00:28:02.000
 Right, yeah, yeah.

00:28:02.000 --> 00:28:03.000
 That is amazing.

00:28:03.000 --> 00:28:07.000
 And they're only found because scientists can track earthquakes through the Earth

00:28:07.000 --> 00:28:11.000
 and you spot where the reverberations, how long they take to get through the Earth

00:28:11.000 --> 00:28:14.000
 and you can build up a profile very slowly and carefully

00:28:14.000 --> 00:28:18.000
 of what the different structures are based on how fast waves travel.

00:28:18.000 --> 00:28:20.000
 This is just news to me that...

00:28:20.000 --> 00:28:21.000
 Right.

00:28:21.000 --> 00:28:23.000
 Because last time I did geography, I was a child

00:28:23.000 --> 00:28:25.000
 and I thought it was...

00:28:25.000 --> 00:28:27.000
 Then there was magma.

00:28:27.000 --> 00:28:31.000
 The mantle is much more fluid and then there's an outer liquid core in it in a solid core.

00:28:31.000 --> 00:28:32.000
 So, yeah.

00:28:32.000 --> 00:28:34.000
 There's space around Jason.

00:28:34.000 --> 00:28:35.000
 No, that was me.

00:28:35.000 --> 00:28:36.000
 There's no space at all.

00:28:36.000 --> 00:28:37.000
 There's no space at all.

00:28:37.000 --> 00:28:39.000
 So in what sense is Jason a mountain?

00:28:39.000 --> 00:28:41.000
 It's a different type of rock.

00:28:41.000 --> 00:28:44.000
 You've got the sort of quite liquid mantle

00:28:44.000 --> 00:28:47.000
 but you've got much more solid rock, which is this Jason stuff, is that right?

00:28:47.000 --> 00:28:48.000
 That's right, yeah, yeah.

00:28:48.000 --> 00:28:51.000
 But I think it's really interesting that these are named after blokes

00:28:51.000 --> 00:28:54.000
 because actually quite a lot of this science was done by women.

00:28:54.000 --> 00:28:56.000
 Right, so a...

00:28:56.000 --> 00:28:58.000
 Sorry, did you say you were surprised?

00:28:58.000 --> 00:29:01.000
 Yeah, it's so weird.

00:29:01.000 --> 00:29:02.000
 It's so weird.

00:29:02.000 --> 00:29:04.000
 Everything else has happened in history.

00:29:04.000 --> 00:29:06.000
 It's bizarre.

00:29:06.000 --> 00:29:08.000
 One person, for instance, Inga Lehmann,

00:29:08.000 --> 00:29:11.000
 she was the first to work out that the Earth had a solid core.

00:29:11.000 --> 00:29:14.000
 And what it was, again, it's like the vibrations going through the Earth

00:29:14.000 --> 00:29:16.000
 and they realised there must have been a core there

00:29:16.000 --> 00:29:18.000
 because the vibrations would come after an earthquake

00:29:18.000 --> 00:29:21.000
 and then if you were exactly opposite the earthquake, you wouldn't see them.

00:29:21.000 --> 00:29:23.000
 And so there must have been something liquid there.

00:29:23.000 --> 00:29:26.000
 But actually, she noticed that if you looked at seismographs,

00:29:26.000 --> 00:29:29.000
 there were really, really tiny amounts of vibrations.

00:29:29.000 --> 00:29:31.000
 So it wasn't completely dark.

00:29:31.000 --> 00:29:36.000
 And what she realised was that this was because there was also a solid core

00:29:36.000 --> 00:29:38.000
 inside the liquid core.

00:29:38.000 --> 00:29:40.000
 But they all thought that, you know, she must be wrong

00:29:40.000 --> 00:29:43.000
 and it must have been like a discrepancy in the seismographs.

00:29:43.000 --> 00:29:44.000
 The seismographs must be wrong

00:29:44.000 --> 00:29:47.000
 because this woman can't possibly be right that there's an extra core in there.

00:29:47.000 --> 00:29:50.000
 But it turned out like in 1970.

00:29:50.000 --> 00:29:52.000
 I think she was still alive.

00:29:52.000 --> 00:29:54.000
 But we found out, yeah, we found out that it was true.

00:29:54.000 --> 00:29:56.000
 Wow. Amazing.

00:29:56.000 --> 00:29:58.000
 So I've got a couple of things on Jason Statham.

00:29:58.000 --> 00:30:01.000
 Me too.

00:30:01.000 --> 00:30:07.000
 I don't know, is it like a sandwich you got from your local shop?

00:30:07.000 --> 00:30:11.000
 I was just looking into notable Jason's

00:30:11.000 --> 00:30:13.000
 because I thought that's the territory.

00:30:13.000 --> 00:30:15.000
 Are you joking?

00:30:15.000 --> 00:30:19.000
 I've got eight pages of dense geological data.

00:30:20.000 --> 00:30:22.000
 Jason Statham is in Meg too.

00:30:22.000 --> 00:30:24.000
 He's massive.

00:30:24.000 --> 00:30:25.000
 Yeah, he is. He's incredible.

00:30:25.000 --> 00:30:28.000
 So he was filming Expendables 3, I think it was.

00:30:28.000 --> 00:30:29.000
 I've got this too.

00:30:29.000 --> 00:30:32.000
 Have you got this? Amazing story. Amazing story.

00:30:32.000 --> 00:30:37.000
 We're literally going from the structure of the entire

00:30:37.000 --> 00:30:40.000
 all life, all of everything we've ever known.

00:30:40.000 --> 00:30:42.000
 These amazing scientists.

00:30:42.000 --> 00:30:44.000
 Yeah, sorry, the Expendables 3.

00:30:44.000 --> 00:30:45.000
 He's in a car, yeah.

00:30:45.000 --> 00:30:47.000
 You listen to this and tell me you're not amazed.

00:30:47.000 --> 00:30:50.000
 He's in a car and he's doing a scene and suddenly...

00:30:50.000 --> 00:30:52.000
 He likes to do his own stunts.

00:30:52.000 --> 00:30:54.000
 Loves to do his own stunts, Jason, doesn't he?

00:30:54.000 --> 00:30:56.000
 Yeah, and he needs to hit the brakes

00:30:56.000 --> 00:30:58.000
 because he needs to stop before there's a cliff

00:30:58.000 --> 00:31:00.000
 which drops 60 feet into the black sea.

00:31:00.000 --> 00:31:02.000
 Gosh, 60 feet? 60 feet.

00:31:02.000 --> 00:31:05.000
 That's nearly as much as the 2,000 miles of mantle

00:31:05.000 --> 00:31:08.000
 between the crust and the core.

00:31:08.000 --> 00:31:14.000
 So the brakes fail, Statham's in the car

00:31:14.000 --> 00:31:16.000
 and it goes off the cliff.

00:31:16.000 --> 00:31:18.000
 This is a Hollywood film.

00:31:18.000 --> 00:31:21.000
 He's plunging 60 feet into...

00:31:21.000 --> 00:31:23.000
 A three-ton stunt truck.

00:31:23.000 --> 00:31:24.000
 A three-ton stunt truck.

00:31:24.000 --> 00:31:25.000
 Sorry, he's driving the truck.

00:31:25.000 --> 00:31:26.000
 He's driving the truck.

00:31:26.000 --> 00:31:28.000
 He's driving the truck. We're not listening?

00:31:28.000 --> 00:31:32.000
 And so then he should crash.

00:31:32.000 --> 00:31:34.000
 Anyone else, any other of the Expendables,

00:31:34.000 --> 00:31:36.000
 you put Stallone in there, you put Schwarzenegger.

00:31:36.000 --> 00:31:38.000
 They would die in that moment, right?

00:31:38.000 --> 00:31:42.000
 Statham manages to leap out of the car

00:31:42.000 --> 00:31:45.000
 and successfully dive into the ocean

00:31:45.000 --> 00:31:47.000
 and then comes up and he's all okay.

00:31:47.000 --> 00:31:48.000
 And why is he okay, Sally?

00:31:48.000 --> 00:31:51.000
 He's okay because before he became an actor,

00:31:51.000 --> 00:31:54.000
 he was a competitive diver, genuinely.

00:31:54.000 --> 00:31:56.000
 And he's done a lot of free diving

00:31:56.000 --> 00:31:58.000
 and has got a lot of scuba experience.

00:31:58.000 --> 00:31:59.000
 Exactly.

00:31:59.000 --> 00:32:01.000
 But he was very, very good at diving,

00:32:01.000 --> 00:32:03.000
 but not quite good enough to make the Olympic team,

00:32:03.000 --> 00:32:04.000
 so he decided to branch out.

00:32:04.000 --> 00:32:06.000
 Exactly, but he did represent Britain

00:32:06.000 --> 00:32:08.000
 in the Commonwealth Games in 1990.

00:32:08.000 --> 00:32:10.000
 Oh, so it's not like scuba diving, it's highboard diving.

00:32:10.000 --> 00:32:12.000
 Highboard diving, which he used to practice

00:32:12.000 --> 00:32:14.000
 in Crystal Palace as a highboard there

00:32:14.000 --> 00:32:17.000
 and they have a pool there where Tom Daly would practice as well.

00:32:17.000 --> 00:32:19.000
 And before Tom Daly, Jason Statham, he would be there.

00:32:19.000 --> 00:32:20.000
 That's incredible.

00:32:20.000 --> 00:32:22.000
 So Jason Statham, that's really interesting

00:32:22.000 --> 00:32:24.000
 because Jason Statham, that means it might have been helpful

00:32:24.000 --> 00:32:32.000
 in the first attempt to dig down into the Earth's mantle in 1961.

00:32:32.000 --> 00:32:37.000
 So this was a thing called Project Mohole, okay?

00:32:37.000 --> 00:32:39.000
 It was an attempt to find the lower limit of the Earth's crust,

00:32:39.000 --> 00:32:42.000
 which is very, very thick on land and much thinner over the ocean.

00:32:42.000 --> 00:32:45.000
 The USA was losing the space race in 1961,

00:32:45.000 --> 00:32:48.000
 the Soviets were way ahead, and so the USA said,

00:32:48.000 --> 00:32:51.000
 "Well, just dig instead and we'll do better at digging

00:32:51.000 --> 00:32:53.000
 and that'll be our new thing."

00:32:53.000 --> 00:32:58.000
 So they tried to get down beyond this thin layer of crust

00:32:58.000 --> 00:32:59.000
 where it meets the mantle,

00:32:59.000 --> 00:33:02.000
 which is a point called the Mohovovich discontinuity.

00:33:02.000 --> 00:33:04.000
 It didn't work.

00:33:04.000 --> 00:33:06.000
 So they went into the ocean.

00:33:06.000 --> 00:33:08.000
 The weirdest thing was that there was a ship

00:33:08.000 --> 00:33:11.000
 which was sent to do the drilling operation

00:33:11.000 --> 00:33:13.000
 to keep it stable in the same bit of the ocean.

00:33:13.000 --> 00:33:15.000
 Their solution was they fitted propellers

00:33:15.000 --> 00:33:17.000
 all the way around the outside

00:33:17.000 --> 00:33:19.000
 and they just fired them all at the same time.

00:33:19.000 --> 00:33:21.000
 That's brilliant.

00:33:21.000 --> 00:33:23.000
 They probably needed marine biologists on the boat, right,

00:33:23.000 --> 00:33:25.000
 in order to do the science.

00:33:25.000 --> 00:33:27.000
 I'm not falling for it.

00:33:27.000 --> 00:33:30.000
 Did you know that Jason Momoa,

00:33:30.000 --> 00:33:35.000
 who became Aquaman later in his career,

00:33:35.000 --> 00:33:39.000
 first studied marine biology when he was at university

00:33:39.000 --> 00:33:42.000
 before transferring to wildlife biology?

00:33:42.000 --> 00:33:45.000
 That is so interesting, Dad. Thank you.

00:33:45.000 --> 00:33:48.000
 They did have a kind of hero beginning with Jay

00:33:48.000 --> 00:33:50.000
 and Jay named Hero there

00:33:50.000 --> 00:33:52.000
 because John Steinbeck was present of Mice and Men.

00:33:52.000 --> 00:33:54.000
 John Steinbeck.

00:33:54.000 --> 00:33:57.000
 He was there kind of writing about it,

00:33:57.000 --> 00:33:59.000
 but sadly it didn't work.

00:33:59.000 --> 00:34:01.000
 Gosh, you weren't kidding.

00:34:01.000 --> 00:34:03.000
 In the dressing room he said,

00:34:03.000 --> 00:34:08.000
 "I've got 15 minutes brilliant material on Jason."

00:34:08.000 --> 00:34:10.000
 There is a bit of advance this year.

00:34:10.000 --> 00:34:12.000
 This is quite sort of geeky now,

00:34:12.000 --> 00:34:14.000
 but scientists have just extracted a chunk of the mantle

00:34:14.000 --> 00:34:16.000
 for the first time.

00:34:16.000 --> 00:34:18.000
 Of Earth's mantle?

00:34:18.000 --> 00:34:20.000
 We're trying to work out how to do it, right?

00:34:20.000 --> 00:34:22.000
 And they realized they don't go to the mantle,

00:34:22.000 --> 00:34:25.000
 go to where rock from the mantle has been pushed

00:34:25.000 --> 00:34:27.000
 above its normal resting place.

00:34:27.000 --> 00:34:30.000
 So they drilled into an underwater mountain,

00:34:30.000 --> 00:34:33.000
 but like a normal underwater mountain is in

00:34:33.000 --> 00:34:35.000
 at the bottom of the mid-Atlantic ridge.

00:34:35.000 --> 00:34:37.000
 They drilled in slightly sideways

00:34:37.000 --> 00:34:39.000
 and they have a core of mantle rock,

00:34:39.000 --> 00:34:41.000
 which is a kilometre long,

00:34:41.000 --> 00:34:43.000
 and they've extracted that core

00:34:43.000 --> 00:34:45.000
 and that allowed them to study all sorts of things

00:34:45.000 --> 00:34:47.000
 about the deep Earth.

00:34:47.000 --> 00:34:49.000
 So cool.

00:34:49.000 --> 00:34:51.000
 That's incredible.

00:34:51.000 --> 00:34:53.000
 All I've got going on here is,

00:34:53.000 --> 00:34:55.000
 "You can keep it on your mantle piece."

00:34:55.000 --> 00:34:58.000
 I just can't join in with the science stuff, really.

00:34:58.000 --> 00:35:03.000
 Well, Jason Statham.

00:35:03.000 --> 00:35:05.000
 I do have a fact about Jason Statham.

00:35:05.000 --> 00:35:08.000
 Oh, look who goes crawling back to the other side.

00:35:08.000 --> 00:35:13.000
 He fits very well as in he would be a great action hero,

00:35:13.000 --> 00:35:15.000
 even with his, you know,

00:35:15.000 --> 00:35:17.000
 his human name, as in his name,

00:35:17.000 --> 00:35:19.000
 is a good name for an action hero.

00:35:19.000 --> 00:35:21.000
 So is it not his real name, Jason Statham?

00:35:21.000 --> 00:35:23.000
 No, it is his real name, as far as I know.

00:35:23.000 --> 00:35:25.000
 But my point is that action heroes

00:35:25.000 --> 00:35:27.000
 tend to have names beginning with J.

00:35:27.000 --> 00:35:29.000
 James Bond, Jason Bourne,

00:35:29.000 --> 00:35:31.000
 John Wick, Jack Reacher, John McLean,

00:35:31.000 --> 00:35:33.000
 John James Rambo.

00:35:33.000 --> 00:35:35.000
 Oh, yeah.

00:35:35.000 --> 00:35:37.000
 And there was a study, a brilliant study,

00:35:37.000 --> 00:35:39.000
 by a writer at Slate called Demetria Glace,

00:35:39.000 --> 00:35:41.000
 and she studied 2,000 action movies,

00:35:41.000 --> 00:35:43.000
 pretty much every modern Western action movie

00:35:43.000 --> 00:35:46.000
 with a male sort of single everyman protagonist.

00:35:46.000 --> 00:35:49.000
 A third of them had names beginning with J,

00:35:49.000 --> 00:35:51.000
 which is very unusual.

00:35:51.000 --> 00:35:54.000
 Do you know that the Earth is younger on the inside

00:35:54.000 --> 00:35:56.000
 than it is on the outside?

00:35:56.000 --> 00:35:58.000
 What?

00:35:58.000 --> 00:36:00.000
 So when you get to the mantle level up here...

00:36:00.000 --> 00:36:02.000
 Judas.

00:36:02.000 --> 00:36:04.000
 That would be a good name for an action movie.

00:36:04.000 --> 00:36:06.000
 Judas, great action story, yeah.

00:36:06.000 --> 00:36:08.000
 This is like Freaky Friday.

00:36:08.000 --> 00:36:10.000
 Yeah.

00:36:10.000 --> 00:36:12.000
 So as we saw in the movie Interstellar,

00:36:12.000 --> 00:36:15.000
 where when Matthew McConaughey is travelling out into space,

00:36:15.000 --> 00:36:17.000
 gravity distorts time, doesn't it?

00:36:17.000 --> 00:36:19.000
 And there's a reason that we say that

00:36:19.000 --> 00:36:21.000
 when astronauts are in space, they're almost time travellers,

00:36:21.000 --> 00:36:24.000
 because they age differently, because time travels differently.

00:36:24.000 --> 00:36:26.000
 If you were at the core of our planet,

00:36:26.000 --> 00:36:29.000
 and that means then the core of our planet itself,

00:36:29.000 --> 00:36:31.000
 is travelling at a different time.

00:36:31.000 --> 00:36:34.000
 Two and a half years younger than the rest of our planet,

00:36:34.000 --> 00:36:36.000
 because gravity is so intense down there,

00:36:36.000 --> 00:36:38.000
 that it slowed down time.

00:36:38.000 --> 00:36:40.000
 That's pretty cool.

00:36:40.000 --> 00:36:42.000
 Whatever.

00:36:42.000 --> 00:36:44.000
 OK, let me tell you one thing about geology,

00:36:44.000 --> 00:36:47.000
 which this will totally blow your mind, right?

00:36:47.000 --> 00:36:49.000
 So there's a place called the Heart Mountain

00:36:49.000 --> 00:36:51.000
 in Northwest America.

00:36:51.000 --> 00:36:55.000
 And I'm talking quite a lot of millions of years ago,

00:36:55.000 --> 00:36:58.000
 but at one stage that mountain moved

00:36:58.000 --> 00:37:01.000
 62 miles in half an hour.

00:37:01.000 --> 00:37:03.000
 Really? The entire mountain.

00:37:03.000 --> 00:37:05.000
 What? Isn't that amazing?

00:37:05.000 --> 00:37:07.000
 So there's a load of basically magma,

00:37:07.000 --> 00:37:09.000
 there's a big sort of river of magma there,

00:37:09.000 --> 00:37:12.000
 a load of water got into it, there was a massive explosion,

00:37:12.000 --> 00:37:16.000
 and the entire mountain moved at 100 miles an hour.

00:37:16.000 --> 00:37:18.000
 Oh, my word. No.

00:37:18.000 --> 00:37:20.000
 But half an hour.

00:37:20.000 --> 00:37:22.000
 We're talking millions and millions and millions of years ago.

00:37:22.000 --> 00:37:24.000
 Oh, this was last year.

00:37:24.000 --> 00:37:27.000
 So you just go skiing and you're like, oh, my God!

00:37:27.000 --> 00:37:29.000
 Whoa!

00:37:29.000 --> 00:37:33.000
 Are we there yet? It's right here.

00:37:33.000 --> 00:37:35.000
 Oh, fuck. No. Sorry, kids.

00:37:35.000 --> 00:37:43.000
 OK, it is time for our final fact of the show,

00:37:43.000 --> 00:37:45.000
 and that is James.

00:37:45.000 --> 00:37:48.000
 OK, my fact this week is that you could tell the social status

00:37:48.000 --> 00:37:53.000
 of an ancient Egyptian man by the colour of his condom.

00:37:55.000 --> 00:38:01.000
 I mean, surely you would have an inkling before you got to see him.

00:38:01.000 --> 00:38:05.000
 Or it's a shock, isn't it?

00:38:05.000 --> 00:38:07.000
 You told me you were a pharaoh!

00:38:07.000 --> 00:38:12.000
 It's bizarre, isn't it?

00:38:12.000 --> 00:38:14.000
 I've read this in a couple of places.

00:38:14.000 --> 00:38:17.000
 One is an article in the Indian Journal of Urology

00:38:17.000 --> 00:38:19.000
 called The Story of the Condom.

00:38:19.000 --> 00:38:21.000
 One is from an article from the Egypt Museum

00:38:21.000 --> 00:38:23.000
 who have one of these very, very old condoms.

00:38:23.000 --> 00:38:26.000
 And basically, they didn't use them for contraception.

00:38:26.000 --> 00:38:29.000
 They used them to stop diseases,

00:38:29.000 --> 00:38:32.000
 but they also, an insect bite, nearly.

00:38:32.000 --> 00:38:36.000
 But they also used them as an insignia of rencore status.

00:38:36.000 --> 00:38:38.000
 And it was just, when I say condom,

00:38:38.000 --> 00:38:42.000
 I think some of it might have been more like, almost like cod piece.

00:38:42.000 --> 00:38:44.000
 Oh, OK. Right.

00:38:44.000 --> 00:38:46.000
 But they were used against diseases as well.

00:38:46.000 --> 00:38:49.000
 So, you know, we can technically call them condoms.

00:38:49.000 --> 00:38:51.000
 And they were made of linen, soaked in olive oil.

00:38:51.000 --> 00:38:53.000
 OK. And with different colours.

00:38:53.000 --> 00:38:55.000
 The problem is, of all the sauces,

00:38:55.000 --> 00:38:57.000
 maybe you guys found this, but if all the sauces that I found,

00:38:57.000 --> 00:38:59.000
 really good academic sauces,

00:38:59.000 --> 00:39:01.000
 none of them told you what colour you're aiming for.

00:39:01.000 --> 00:39:03.000
 Oh, right.

00:39:03.000 --> 00:39:05.000
 So, I don't know if red was a good one

00:39:05.000 --> 00:39:07.000
 or if blue was a good one.

00:39:07.000 --> 00:39:09.000
 They've got Tutankhamun's condom, haven't they?

00:39:09.000 --> 00:39:11.000
 Do they? Yeah, they do.

00:39:11.000 --> 00:39:14.000
 Yes, they do. Linen, soaked in olive oil,

00:39:14.000 --> 00:39:16.000
 impregnated with his DNA.

00:39:16.000 --> 00:39:18.000
 And it would tie around to his waist.

00:39:18.000 --> 00:39:21.000
 Tie around to his waist with string.

00:39:21.000 --> 00:39:23.000
 But it didn't mention what colour it was.

00:39:23.000 --> 00:39:25.000
 They didn't mention the colour.

00:39:25.000 --> 00:39:27.000
 Why are we not getting the colour system?

00:39:27.000 --> 00:39:29.000
 Sometimes the colours don't...

00:39:29.000 --> 00:39:31.000
 Yeah, right. OK. Gosh.

00:39:31.000 --> 00:39:33.000
 That's very interesting.

00:39:33.000 --> 00:39:35.000
 In the course of researching this,

00:39:35.000 --> 00:39:37.000
 I read probably the weirdest thing I think I've ever read,

00:39:37.000 --> 00:39:40.000
 which is in ancient Rome, condoms.

00:39:40.000 --> 00:39:43.000
 And by the way, I haven't found a legit sauce,

00:39:43.000 --> 00:39:45.000
 but it appears in so many...

00:39:45.000 --> 00:39:47.000
 No, it appears in so many places.

00:39:47.000 --> 00:39:50.000
 They used, apparently, an ancient Roman

00:39:50.000 --> 00:39:52.000
 who was victorious in a battle

00:39:52.000 --> 00:39:54.000
 and had slain his opponent,

00:39:54.000 --> 00:39:57.000
 would then make a condom out of the muscle of the opponent.

00:39:57.000 --> 00:39:59.000
 Oh, don't be daft.

00:39:59.000 --> 00:40:03.000
 Sauce.

00:40:03.000 --> 00:40:07.000
 Well, they did use to make condoms out of animal intestines

00:40:07.000 --> 00:40:09.000
 and bladders in Rome. Yeah.

00:40:09.000 --> 00:40:11.000
 So it's not impossible.

00:40:11.000 --> 00:40:13.000
 It's not impossible. It feels a bit grisly.

00:40:13.000 --> 00:40:15.000
 It feels a bit grisly. It's sort of one of those facts

00:40:15.000 --> 00:40:17.000
 that I prefer. I'm just going to prefer not to believe.

00:40:17.000 --> 00:40:19.000
 Yeah. I know.

00:40:19.000 --> 00:40:21.000
 The ancient Egyptians used to use crocodile dung as spermicide,

00:40:21.000 --> 00:40:23.000
 did you? Yeah.

00:40:23.000 --> 00:40:25.000
 How would you use that? You would use...

00:40:25.000 --> 00:40:27.000
 I don't want to think about it.

00:40:27.000 --> 00:40:29.000
 Why is no one sleeping with me?

00:40:29.000 --> 00:40:31.000
 Uncovered crocodile shit.

00:40:31.000 --> 00:40:33.000
 Do you know that William Buckland,

00:40:33.000 --> 00:40:35.000
 you know the natural... Yeah, who ate everything, yeah.

00:40:35.000 --> 00:40:38.000
 His kids had a hobby horse made out of a dead crocodile.

00:40:38.000 --> 00:40:40.000
 Wow. I don't know why that came into my head.

00:40:40.000 --> 00:40:42.000
 Yeah.

00:40:42.000 --> 00:40:44.000
 My friend Cindy used to have the crocodile

00:40:44.000 --> 00:40:46.000
 that was used in crocodile dundee as a...

00:40:46.000 --> 00:40:48.000
 Like, they had prop crocodiles,

00:40:48.000 --> 00:40:50.000
 and as you went into her house,

00:40:50.000 --> 00:40:52.000
 she had the prop crocodile from croc dundee.

00:40:52.000 --> 00:40:54.000
 Wow. There's no more iconic prop.

00:40:54.000 --> 00:40:56.000
 No, no. Was it a real crocodile?

00:40:56.000 --> 00:40:58.000
 No, no. Was it a pretend crocodile?

00:40:58.000 --> 00:41:00.000
 No, I think it was a pretend crocodile, yeah.

00:41:00.000 --> 00:41:02.000
 Condoms, just quickly. Yeah.

00:41:02.000 --> 00:41:05.000
 So the condoms of the 18th century were quite interesting,

00:41:05.000 --> 00:41:08.000
 because that was sort of getting towards modern condoms,

00:41:08.000 --> 00:41:10.000
 but they're still very primitive.

00:41:10.000 --> 00:41:13.000
 So they were made of sheep kycom, okay,

00:41:13.000 --> 00:41:15.000
 which is the power that connects the small

00:41:15.000 --> 00:41:18.000
 and the large intestine to each other of the sheep.

00:41:18.000 --> 00:41:20.000
 And they had to be treated,

00:41:20.000 --> 00:41:22.000
 and there was a whole nine-step process

00:41:22.000 --> 00:41:25.000
 to make a proper condom out of a sheep's thing, kycom.

00:41:25.000 --> 00:41:27.000
 And they were really scarce.

00:41:27.000 --> 00:41:29.000
 They were very hard to come by, partly because butchers

00:41:29.000 --> 00:41:31.000
 could not be bothered to collect.

00:41:31.000 --> 00:41:33.000
 You know, each sheep has one kycom,

00:41:33.000 --> 00:41:35.000
 so that's one potential condom per sheep,

00:41:35.000 --> 00:41:37.000
 and it was just not worth collecting, basically.

00:41:37.000 --> 00:41:40.000
 So people would just use the sheep instead.

00:41:40.000 --> 00:41:46.000
 Do you know what the first condom in literature

00:41:46.000 --> 00:41:49.000
 was used by the wife of King Minus of Crete,

00:41:49.000 --> 00:41:51.000
 who's called Pacifi,

00:41:51.000 --> 00:41:54.000
 and she used it to stop herself being harmed

00:41:54.000 --> 00:41:56.000
 by King Minus' semen,

00:41:56.000 --> 00:41:59.000
 because it contains scorpions and serpents.

00:41:59.000 --> 00:42:01.000
 Oh.

00:42:01.000 --> 00:42:02.000
 Yeah.

00:42:02.000 --> 00:42:04.000
 Maybe we could just watch something tonight, actually.

00:42:04.000 --> 00:42:06.000
 Maybe, um...

00:42:06.000 --> 00:42:09.000
 Let's watch another episode, actually.

00:42:09.000 --> 00:42:10.000
 Yeah, yeah.

00:42:10.000 --> 00:42:11.000
 Actually, think about it now. Yeah.

00:42:11.000 --> 00:42:14.000
 I discovered that there's a condom make in China

00:42:14.000 --> 00:42:16.000
 called "Jisbon,"

00:42:16.000 --> 00:42:18.000
 which...

00:42:18.000 --> 00:42:20.000
 which is called "Jisbon,"

00:42:20.000 --> 00:42:23.000
 because it's after James Bond.

00:42:23.000 --> 00:42:25.000
 No, the name's Bond.

00:42:25.000 --> 00:42:27.000
 -Jisbon. -Jisbon. Yeah.

00:42:27.000 --> 00:42:33.000
 In 2006, a German entrepreneur launched a spray on condom.

00:42:33.000 --> 00:42:35.000
 -Yes. -Did you come across that?

00:42:35.000 --> 00:42:37.000
 -Yes. -Yeah, but it was stopped by...

00:42:37.000 --> 00:42:40.000
 Yeah, the phrasing was a bit unfortunate there.

00:42:40.000 --> 00:42:43.000
 -Did you come across that out there? -Yeah.

00:42:43.000 --> 00:42:49.000
 And it was stopped short by EU regulations.

00:42:49.000 --> 00:42:52.000
 Oh, I read something slightly different about what stopped it.

00:42:52.000 --> 00:42:54.000
 So he was called Jan Klauser,

00:42:54.000 --> 00:42:57.000
 and he got the idea for it in a car wash,

00:42:57.000 --> 00:42:59.000
 because he, you know, he was...

00:42:59.000 --> 00:43:01.000
 I don't know if he must have been in the car

00:43:01.000 --> 00:43:03.000
 and it was just being sprayed, and he thought,

00:43:03.000 --> 00:43:05.000
 "Oh, maybe. If I... If you, you know,

00:43:05.000 --> 00:43:07.000
 "your penis is the car, as it were,

00:43:07.000 --> 00:43:09.000
 "and you spray it from every angle with the latex,

00:43:09.000 --> 00:43:11.000
 "then you have a perfectly fitted condom."

00:43:11.000 --> 00:43:13.000
 -Right. -You know, perfectly fitted every time.

00:43:13.000 --> 00:43:16.000
 And he got 30 men to test it,

00:43:16.000 --> 00:43:18.000
 and apparently it had exclusively positive reviews.

00:43:18.000 --> 00:43:20.000
 It went really well.

00:43:20.000 --> 00:43:22.000
 But the drawbacks were that it was quite cold,

00:43:22.000 --> 00:43:25.000
 very cold to be just sprayed with this sort of latex liquid,

00:43:25.000 --> 00:43:27.000
 and it takes two full minutes to dry.

00:43:27.000 --> 00:43:29.000
 -To try. -Yeah.

00:43:29.000 --> 00:43:32.000
 But which side is probably not the right size anymore?

00:43:32.000 --> 00:43:34.000
 Yeah.

00:43:34.000 --> 00:43:36.000
 It still ships internationally, though.

00:43:36.000 --> 00:43:38.000
 -Does it? -So it's still not approved by the FDA.

00:43:38.000 --> 00:43:40.000
 -It's still for sale? -Oh, no, that's the galactic cap.

00:43:40.000 --> 00:43:42.000
 -Sorry. -What's that?

00:43:42.000 --> 00:43:45.000
 The galactic cap. Sorry, that's just titchy-titchy,

00:43:45.000 --> 00:43:47.000
 like a beanie for your penis.

00:43:47.000 --> 00:43:49.000
 Oh, OK. What, like a hipster?

00:43:49.000 --> 00:43:51.000
 -Yeah, a hipster one. -What?

00:43:51.000 --> 00:43:53.000
 Leaving the shaft. It's not been approved by the FDA,

00:43:53.000 --> 00:43:55.000
 but it does ship internationally.

00:43:55.000 --> 00:43:57.000
 -Ah, OK. -I don't know how it stays on.

00:43:57.000 --> 00:44:00.000
 Right, OK. It's very exciting.

00:44:00.000 --> 00:44:04.000
 You mentioned China earlier with the James Bond thing.

00:44:04.000 --> 00:44:07.000
 I was reading about ancient Chinese contraception,

00:44:07.000 --> 00:44:10.000
 and because in the early days, there was, you know,

00:44:10.000 --> 00:44:12.000
 there was a story that tortoise shell,

00:44:12.000 --> 00:44:15.000
 in the same way that the beanie was used, was kind of used for...

00:44:15.000 --> 00:44:18.000
 I know, it doesn't quite make sense, and you can't get any further with it.

00:44:18.000 --> 00:44:20.000
 And, like, full disclosure,

00:44:20.000 --> 00:44:23.000
 the article I got this from used the word "dude" a lot,

00:44:23.000 --> 00:44:26.000
 so I don't know how reliable

00:44:26.000 --> 00:44:27.000
 this is.

00:44:27.000 --> 00:44:30.000
 Were you on the scientific journal "Rab Monthly"?

00:44:30.000 --> 00:44:32.000
 -Yeah, yeah, yeah. -That is fine.

00:44:32.000 --> 00:44:34.000
 No, no, this was... 'Cause weirdly, it has sources,

00:44:34.000 --> 00:44:36.000
 but it's saying that there used to be a thing

00:44:36.000 --> 00:44:39.000
 where you were told to reserve ejaculation,

00:44:39.000 --> 00:44:41.000
 so that basically is with, you know,

00:44:41.000 --> 00:44:43.000
 coitus interrupters, right?

00:44:43.000 --> 00:44:45.000
 But the other thing that they said was

00:44:45.000 --> 00:44:50.000
 to move the semen back into you, basically.

00:44:50.000 --> 00:44:52.000
 So that was a method that was taught.

00:44:52.000 --> 00:44:55.000
 So the method was, as point of ejaculation was happening,

00:44:55.000 --> 00:44:58.000
 to press a thumb against, in between,

00:44:58.000 --> 00:45:01.000
 the scrotum and the anus, and what it would do was...

00:45:01.000 --> 00:45:03.000
 My parents are in tonight.

00:45:03.000 --> 00:45:07.000
 You're kidding, this happens every time.

00:45:07.000 --> 00:45:09.000
 Oh, no, okay, right.

00:45:09.000 --> 00:45:12.000
 It's 'cause you mention it in every show we do.

00:45:12.000 --> 00:45:14.000
 So why don't you stick your thumb?

00:45:14.000 --> 00:45:16.000
 So you put your thumb between your scrotum and your anus,

00:45:16.000 --> 00:45:18.000
 and you push, and then it's...

00:45:18.000 --> 00:45:20.000
 The idea is that it redirects...

00:45:20.000 --> 00:45:23.000
 Middle-playing the hokey-cokey with you.

00:45:23.000 --> 00:45:27.000
 It redirects the semen to go up the spine

00:45:27.000 --> 00:45:32.000
 through the chakras and into the brain is the idea.

00:45:32.000 --> 00:45:34.000
 Because sex...

00:45:34.000 --> 00:45:37.000
 I'm sorry, is there a tangible benefit to this procedure?

00:45:37.000 --> 00:45:39.000
 What's that you haven't said?

00:45:39.000 --> 00:45:41.000
 Because there's an idea that you're expelling something

00:45:41.000 --> 00:45:43.000
 from your body which is energy,

00:45:43.000 --> 00:45:45.000
 and unless you were receiving the other energy from the human

00:45:45.000 --> 00:45:47.000
 that you were having sex with, that was a wasted energy.

00:45:47.000 --> 00:45:49.000
 So why not losing your essence?

00:45:49.000 --> 00:45:52.000
 Exactly. Again, from somewhere that says awesome a lot

00:45:52.000 --> 00:45:55.000
 in the article, and I don't know if it's legit,

00:45:55.000 --> 00:45:58.000
 but it seemed legit at the time.

00:45:58.000 --> 00:46:04.000
 I find that really scary, that the penis can suck things...

00:46:04.000 --> 00:46:06.000
 suck things in.

00:46:06.000 --> 00:46:09.000
 I don't know if it can. I don't know if it can.

00:46:09.000 --> 00:46:12.000
 I mean, they've got a problem. People are stopping using them.

00:46:12.000 --> 00:46:15.000
 So we've got the highest syphilis and gonorrhea rates

00:46:15.000 --> 00:46:18.000
 in the UK for years and years, and there was a study done

00:46:18.000 --> 00:46:21.000
 about men who believe they're attractive,

00:46:21.000 --> 00:46:24.000
 who rate their attractiveness high,

00:46:24.000 --> 00:46:27.000
 are much less likely to use a condom.

00:46:27.000 --> 00:46:29.000
 Really? Yeah.

00:46:29.000 --> 00:46:32.000
 Well, that explains why I've got three on right now.

00:46:32.000 --> 00:46:39.000
 How'd you enjoy that one, Mr and Mrs Murray?

00:46:39.000 --> 00:46:48.000
 You can also use condoms as a bungee rope.

00:46:48.000 --> 00:46:51.000
 What? How much weight can they take?

00:46:51.000 --> 00:46:53.000
 Short bungee.

00:46:53.000 --> 00:46:56.000
 They can take the weight of Carlo Mosca Donioso,

00:46:56.000 --> 00:46:59.000
 who did a 30-metre bungee jump using a string

00:46:59.000 --> 00:47:02.000
 of 18,500 condoms.

00:47:02.000 --> 00:47:04.000
 Which brand?

00:47:04.000 --> 00:47:06.000
 Yeah.

00:47:06.000 --> 00:47:08.000
 They didn't snap.

00:47:08.000 --> 00:47:11.000
 It took him four months to tie them together.

00:47:11.000 --> 00:47:13.000
 Slippery.

00:47:13.000 --> 00:47:16.000
 Well, that's what he said. The condoms are slippery.

00:47:16.000 --> 00:47:19.000
 If you tied a knot, it would just slip out.

00:47:19.000 --> 00:47:22.000
 The testing you'd have to do on that rope to be confident of it.

00:47:22.000 --> 00:47:25.000
 Yeah, well, you know what? They used mathematical formulas

00:47:25.000 --> 00:47:28.000
 to work out how strong it would have to be.

00:47:28.000 --> 00:47:31.000
 So they worked out how many they would need using maths

00:47:31.000 --> 00:47:34.000
 rather than using applied stuff.

00:47:34.000 --> 00:47:37.000
 But he did say he was 99% sure it would work,

00:47:37.000 --> 00:47:40.000
 but his stomach was in the knot for a month before the jump.

00:47:40.000 --> 00:47:43.000
 But it worked, and he did manage to do it.

00:47:43.000 --> 00:47:46.000
 So, he's one of those guys who's been in condoms in the States.

00:47:46.000 --> 00:47:49.000
 It's a brand in South America.

00:47:49.000 --> 00:47:52.000
 They have, because they've got a guy there who's like

00:47:52.000 --> 00:47:55.000
 the great, you know, the Steve Jobs of condoms, basically.

00:47:55.000 --> 00:47:58.000
 Like, he came into the company, he's innovated,

00:47:58.000 --> 00:48:01.000
 he's made them thinner than ever before.

00:48:01.000 --> 00:48:04.000
 He's one of those guys who's just like constantly,

00:48:04.000 --> 00:48:07.000
 and so when they have an invention that's gone through

00:48:07.000 --> 00:48:10.000
 the science side of it, kind of like this bungee,

00:48:10.000 --> 00:48:13.000
 they have these big couples who are known as the bedroom panel,

00:48:13.000 --> 00:48:15.000
 and the condoms get given to them.

00:48:15.000 --> 00:48:17.000
 So once or twice a month, they'll get given

00:48:17.000 --> 00:48:19.000
 a sort of new condom test design.

00:48:19.000 --> 00:48:22.000
 Twice a month? The deviants.

00:48:22.000 --> 00:48:27.000
 It's a whole other world, isn't it?

00:48:27.000 --> 00:48:31.000
 One for witsom tide, one for mickleness, and you're fine.

00:48:31.000 --> 00:48:34.000
 They're slightly smaller Trojans, aren't they, apparently?

00:48:34.000 --> 00:48:37.000
 Oh, are they? Apparently, yes.

00:48:37.000 --> 00:48:40.000
 Well, I read that on the internet today, dude.

00:48:40.000 --> 00:48:43.000
 I also read, like, the flavours were just blew my mind.
