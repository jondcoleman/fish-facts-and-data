00:00:00,400 --> 00:00:07,600
 Hi everyone, welcome to this week's episode of No Such Things as a Fish, where we were joined in the Soho Theatre London by the

2
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:10,000
 incredible Sally Phillips.

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:18,080
 Now a lot of you will be excited by that, I'm sure because Sally has been on the podcast a couple of times now and she is so funny.

4
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:22,320
 She is just one of us really. She loves doing the research. She loves facts.

5
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:27,760
 Just for anyone who doesn't know who Sally is, she is basically the doyen of

6
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:35,200
 British comedy over the last however many years. She was in Smack the Pony, she was in Alan Partridge,

7
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:38,080
 she played the Prime Minister of Finland in Veep.

8
00:00:38,080 --> 00:00:43,600
 I mean, she's been in everything. You know who Sally Phillips is. You're really going to enjoy this show.

9
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:48,160
 I don't really have much more to say, so I might as well quickly say don't forget to join Club Fish.

10
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:54,800

11
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:59,040
 Loads of bonus material, ad-free episodes, all sorts of stuff on there. A few weeks ago,

12
00:00:59,040 --> 00:01:02,560
 we gave away a cabbage patch doll and actually that reminds me,

13
00:01:02,560 --> 00:01:07,520
 once you've listened to this show, do go on to our various social medias because you will be able to see

14
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:15,360
 a couple of props that were used in this show. I'm sure we'll post them up, so definitely go and check those out because they're absolutely brilliant.

15
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:20,320
 Look, I don't want to use up any more of your time. I'm just going to say on with the podcast!

16
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:37,120
 [Music]

17
00:01:37,120 --> 00:01:39,120
 Oh, nice!

18
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:49,600
 Hello and welcome to another episode and no such thing as a fish, a weekly podcast this week!

19
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:53,280
 Coming to you live from Soho Theatre!

20
00:01:53,280 --> 00:02:02,720
 My name is Dan Schreiber. I am sitting here with James Harkin, Andrew Hunter Murray and Sally Phillips.

21
00:02:02,720 --> 00:02:10,320
 And once again, we have gathered around the microphones with our four favorite facts from the last seven days and in no particular order, here we go.

22
00:02:10,320 --> 00:02:13,280
 Starting with fact number one, and that is Sally.

23
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:24,240
 So, I was entranced by the Finnish Hobby Horse Championships that was doing the round on Twitter and also I was in Finland when they were being held, unfortunately didn't make it.

24
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:35,440
 But my fact is that the world's best hobby horse jumper can jump high enough to theoretically clear the first two jumps in the Grand National.

25
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:46,720
 It's amazing how many of you saw it. It was really amazing. The Hobby Horse Championships, it's mainly girls between 11 and 18 there.

26
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:48,400
 Okay, and is it one?

27
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:49,360
 You can't afford a wheel horse.

28
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:51,520
 It's on BBC One, like where are they?

29
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:58,480
 The girls are horribly bullied by their compatriots for being into, yeah, there was a film called Hobby Horse Revolution.

30
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:08,000
 2019. It's a big thing, it's like once you look into it, and it is some boys but mainly girls and some adult women,

31
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:13,760
 but I think that's a bit strange. They often go into Woodland and do it in secret.

32
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:17,760
 So they don't give away their moves or?

33
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:20,400
 No, so they don't get attacked.

34
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:31,440
 And they start off, most people make their own hobby horses because a pro hobby horse costs about 300 euros.

35
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:34,400
 And the bridle is...

36
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:36,720
 We're talking about the stick with the head of the horse.

37
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:40,400
 Yeah, so it's the realism that's the expansiveness, is it?

38
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:43,040
 Or are they like, is it like Nimbus 2000.

39
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:50,080
 I don't know, I don't know, but my partner and I, because we knew this was live and we love the show very much,

40
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:55,120
 this afternoon spent a full 15 minutes each making everyone a hobby horse.

41
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:55,600
 What?

42
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:56,160
 No way.

43
00:03:56,160 --> 00:03:58,960
 What?

44
00:03:58,960 --> 00:04:03,040
 Oh my God.

45
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:05,200
 What?

46
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:14,160
 So Andy, for the people who can't see this, for the people who can't see this, bad luck because it's indescribable.

47
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:14,960
 It is incredible.

48
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:15,680
 This is amazing.

49
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:19,200
 Yours does look a tiny bit like a bad date night, girls.

50
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:27,440
 Mine is, it's a very colourful sock, which is stuffed and it has a mop hair and some eyes.

51
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:28,720
 And yeah, I love it.

52
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:29,280
 And yours?

53
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:29,680
 Thank you so much.

54
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:33,760
 Mine is ultra realistic, I would say. This is a horse.

55
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:37,520
 Yeah, mine slightly looks like he ran out of materials and gave up.

56
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:41,680
 Yours is very cool, it's very kind of like space horse.

57
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:48,080
 Mine's very space, like a glam rock, sort of, this hair is like very, let's zeppelin for the year three.

58
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:51,200
 I'd say I did that one, I'm quite pleased with that one.

59
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:56,080
 And this one's made out of bandages, a planta and it's got radishes for eyes.

60
00:04:56,080 --> 00:05:00,080
 Oh wow, this is incredible, this is incredible.

61
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:06,240
 Well, I thought, I mean, I kind of thought we could maybe have a go, but that would be too embarrassing, wouldn't it?

62
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:08,800
 Well, maybe we should get the audience to have a go, do a bit of dressage.

63
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:13,600
 Because what would happen is there would be loads of different disciplines.

64
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:17,040
 Everyone's putting it down, don't make me do it, don't make me do it.

65
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:19,600
 I'm a geek, I don't like physical action.

66
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:22,160
 Yeah, they do show jumping, they do puissance,

67
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:28,880
 which is the only time you're allowed to run at a jump with, you're allowed to run at it rather than canter.

68
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:34,400
 And yeah, that is the one where they've jumped a whole Peter Dinklage.

69
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:36,720
 Oh, is that how tall Peter is?

70
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:39,520
 Four foot seven inches, four foot seven inches.

71
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:43,040
 But there's also, you know, show jumping, they do,

72
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:45,600
 the international is 80 centimetres, the jumps.

73
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:50,960
 But the fins so dominate that their jumps are one metre, 10 centimetres.

74
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:51,600
 Wow.

75
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:55,040
 So 10,000 hobby horses in Finland, in Finland alone.

76
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:55,920
 That's incredible.

77
00:05:55,920 --> 00:05:58,240
 But it's spreading, it's a reason I don't know.

78
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:01,840
 But is there a reason it hasn't got further or that it's so finished?

79
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:03,120
 It's got quite far.

80
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:03,680
 Right, okay.

81
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:06,880
 It has actually got quite, it's got so much further than you'd think.

82
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:11,520
 All the Nordic nations, Canada, Ukraine.

83
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:12,800
 Yeah, yeah, it's in so many places, but sometimes it's...

84
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:14,400
 It's quite northern, isn't it?

85
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:17,360
 It's quite a north, northern Europe and Canada,

86
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:20,320
 like places where you have long, dark nights with not much else to do.

87
00:06:20,320 --> 00:06:21,280
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

88
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:23,520
 Well, you say that, you say that.

89
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:29,600
 But I mean, at least they're nice to the horses in the Nordic nations,

90
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:33,680
 whereas our pretend horses have a dark, dark history.

91
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:34,320
 Right.

92
00:06:34,320 --> 00:06:35,840
 I'm talking about the...

93
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:38,800
 None of you came across that, the Padstow, Obi-Wanstow.

94
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:39,520
 Oh, the Obi-Wanstow.

95
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:42,400
 Yeah, but the scariest one is in Wales.

96
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:46,480
 In Wales, they use real horse skulls on a stick.

97
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:47,120
 Really?

98
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:47,680
 Yeah, we're...

99
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:50,640
 This isn't teenage girls doing it, though, is it?

100
00:06:50,640 --> 00:06:52,720
 Well, the video I saw...

101
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:53,680
 It's like ghost horse.

102
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:56,160
 Elderly man, go with some friends,

103
00:06:56,160 --> 00:07:00,080
 goes to the door of someone's house,

104
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:04,000
 and then sings quite a scary song in Welsh.

105
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:07,760
 And if you cannot finish the song inside the house,

106
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:09,280
 they force their way in.

107
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:09,760
 Okay.

108
00:07:09,760 --> 00:07:12,640
 And there's a lot of chasing girls with horses and...

109
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:14,880
 It's all sort of strange folky rituals, isn't it?

110
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:16,720
 Very strange folky rituals, yeah.

111
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:18,400
 But there are loads of these rituals all over the place.

112
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:18,720
 Yeah, it's all over the place.

113
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:19,920
 Okay, there's the...

114
00:07:19,920 --> 00:07:21,920
 You said Padstow, which is another one.

115
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:23,120
 There's the Hoden horse in Ken.

116
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:24,640
 Did you see the Padstow?

117
00:07:24,640 --> 00:07:25,760
 Did you look at that online?

118
00:07:25,760 --> 00:07:26,240
 Yeah, I did.

119
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:26,800
 It doesn't look...

120
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:27,840
 I mean, it's really bizarre.

121
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:29,600
 It looks like a grand piano.

122
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:30,560
 Oh, really?

123
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:32,560
 But with a tail and things sticking out the front,

124
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:33,840
 then they sort of rock it.

125
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:34,800
 Yeah, they're kind of a bit rich.

126
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:35,440
 Very strange.

127
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:38,960
 Is this where the pantomime horse comes from?

128
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:39,120
 No.

129
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:41,280
 Because these are really weird sort of ritual,

130
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:43,040
 fertility things, but it's nothing to do with the pantomime.

131
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:44,640
 No, nothing to do with the pantomime horse.

132
00:07:44,640 --> 00:07:45,360
 Maybe a bit.

133
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:46,800
 Well, no, it's really strange.

134
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:48,560
 It's the Lord of Misrules.

135
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:50,080
 So it's the spirit of...

136
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:51,920
 Well, that's what Google told me.

137
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:53,200
 Well, what is it?

138
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:54,320
 I'm talking like I've got...

139
00:07:54,320 --> 00:07:55,200
 What is the pantomime horse?

140
00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:57,840
 But a kind of, you know, that's a sort of misrule thing,

141
00:07:57,840 --> 00:07:58,400
 isn't it?

142
00:07:58,400 --> 00:07:59,440
 You know, it's unnatural.

143
00:07:59,440 --> 00:07:59,520
 The pantomime horse.

144
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:00,160
 It's weird.

145
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:01,200
 Yes, so...

146
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:03,040
 Who's in the front? Who's in the back?

147
00:08:03,040 --> 00:08:03,680
 Yeah.

148
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:04,160
 No?

149
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:04,560
 No one...

150
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:05,840
 Yeah, I always feel that's the...

151
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:08,000
 You would get on really well with Kate Beckinsale.

152
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:08,720
 Did you see this?

153
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:09,360
 Oh, really?

154
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:11,280
 She travels with the pantomime horse everywhere.

155
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:11,840
 She does.

156
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:12,400
 Yeah.

157
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:14,160
 And she reckons it's like really good.

158
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:16,400
 Well, it kind of calms her down as she's stressed.

159
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:18,000
 Wait, sorry, with people in it?

160
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
 Well, does she...?

161
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:24,000
 Like an emotional support animal.

162
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
 She brings the costume around,

163
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
 and then if she's got a bit of downtime,

164
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
 then she'll get in it and she'll find someone else

165
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,280
 to get in it with her.

166
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:34,000
 And it's just a nice way of calming down, relaxing and...

167
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:38,000
 Yes, very normal.

168
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
 I think the biggest problem on the sort of a PR level

169
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
 is that no matter how you try and spin it,

170
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
 it always sounds nuts when you say the thing

171
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
 you're actually doing with hobby horsing.

172
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
 Like, I found a quote from someone who said,

173
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
 "People assume that it's a game

174
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:53,000
 or that we are more or less crazy,"

175
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:58,000
 said Chairwoman of the Finnish Stick Horse Enthusiast Association.

176
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:01,000
 You're never going to make it past the description, are you?

177
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,000
 It's a hard thing.

178
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
 But it sounds like an amazing...

179
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
 I genuinely think, you know, people always talk about

180
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
 at the Olympics, like, why not have someone in the 100 meters

181
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:11,000
 who's just a citizen who's just running alongside

182
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
 and you can really see how fast they're going,

183
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
 having a 12-year-old girl at the Grand National,

184
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:18,000
 make the first two and just stack it

185
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
 head first until the third.

186
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,000
 That would be amazing.

187
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:24,000
 Actually, imagine you had a pantomime horse,

188
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:27,000
 the fastest pantomime horse in the world.

189
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,000
 Yeah.

190
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
 And they are in the 100 meters.

191
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
 You know it's a person, right?

192
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:35,000
 Well, two people, and they're in the 100 meters

193
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
 in the first-ever Olympics.

194
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,000
 Yeah.

195
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,000
 Where do you think they would finish?

196
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
 So, in the first ever...

197
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
 The first-ever Olympics 100 meters race,

198
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:46,000
 you've got the two fastest current pantomime horse people.

199
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,000
 Yeah.

200
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
 Where would they finish in the race?

201
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,000
 Because people did run a bit slower, didn't they,

202
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,000
 in the first Olympics?

203
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:55,000
 Yeah, but they didn't have a pantomime horse costume on.

204
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,000
 Why? I just...

205
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
 Well, the first Olympics, that was Greece.

206
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
 It was just, like, ancient Greece.

207
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
 Oh, no, sorry, in 1996.

208
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,000
 The first modern Olympics.

209
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,000
 Right, first modern.

210
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
 Just shoes were less good then, and they hadn't...

211
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,000
 You know...

212
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
 Maybe someone died in the right race.

213
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,000
 Oh, OK.

214
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:13,000
 Honestly, it's just a straight-up question.

215
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,000
 I'm going to say bronze.

216
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,000
 I'm going to say bronze.

217
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,000
 But, no, no, I'm going to say silver and bronze,

218
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
 because they count as two people.

219
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,000
 Very clever. Very clever.

220
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,000
 Yeah.

221
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
 I'm going to say gold.

222
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,000
 No, well, Dan is right.

223
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,000
 They would have got silver.

224
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:30,000
 The fastest is 12.045 seconds for 100 meters,

225
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:33,000
 and that wouldn't quite have gotten gold in the first Olympics,

226
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,000
 but it would have been the second place.

227
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:38,000
 Does the nose of the person in the back of the pantomime horse

228
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,000
 have to get over the line?

229
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,000
 No, no, OK.

230
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,000
 OK.

231
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,000
 Just the front.

232
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,000
 That's amazing.

233
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,000
 Can I go back to hobby-horsing,

234
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
 just because it's one fact I'm just so desperate to share?

235
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,000
 Yeah.

236
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:50,000
 One of the rules of the hobby-horse competition

237
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:53,000
 is that only stallions and mares can take part

238
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,000
 and geldings are banned.

239
00:10:55,000 --> 00:11:00,000
 Gelding.

240
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,000
 Gelding being a...

241
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,000
 What have you made of that?

242
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,000
 A muted young horse.

243
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,000
 Where are the testicles on this thing?

244
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
 Well, that's what I mean.

245
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,000
 They're all geldings.

246
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,000
 That's what I mean.

247
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,000
 Yeah, well, exactly.

248
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,000
 That's bizarre, isn't it?

249
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,000
 But that's in the rules.

250
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,000
 That's amazing.

251
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,000
 Incredible.

252
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,000
 Pantomime horses.

253
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,000
 I mean, that is the worst ever job.

254
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,000
 Have you ever done that?

255
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,000
 No, I've never done that.

256
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,000
 I've never done that.

257
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,000
 I've never done that.

258
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:22,000
 There were some pantomimes that sometimes used real horses.

259
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,000
 Right.

260
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:27,000
 Because John Barrowman was thrown 20 foot off by one.

261
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:30,000
 They supposedly trained horses, they threw him off.

262
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
 In Glasgow in 2013.

263
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,000
 And there was a...

264
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,000
 Paul O'Grady always used to tell a story

265
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,000
 about being in a panto with a trained horse

266
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,000
 that he had to get into bed with him.

267
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,000
 He used to follow him around.

268
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
 He was playing the fairy godmother in Cinderella.

269
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:46,000
 He used to follow him around the stage with a massive erection.

270
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:49,000
 And he couldn't...

271
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:53,000
 He couldn't say anything because there was loads and loads of kids.

272
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:56,000
 And they're all going, "It's behind you!"

273
00:11:56,000 --> 00:12:00,000
 Oh, wow.

274
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,000
 Good grief.

275
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,000
 That's pretty good.

276
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,000
 Here's the thing about real horses now.

277
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,000
 Yeah.

278
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,000
 If you...

279
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,000
 I don't think we've said this before.

280
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:13,000
 If you frown at a horse and then go away and then come back,

281
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:19,000
 it will remember and be a bit more...

282
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:23,000
 James is doing some stunt work for the people listening at home.

283
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,000
 It'll remember that you frown at home.

284
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,000
 It'll remember that you frown at home.

285
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
 But also if you smile at a horse and then go away,

286
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
 it will think, "Oh, there he is."

287
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
 The horse remembers you frowned.

288
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
 How is it then passing that data on?

289
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,000
 Exactly.

290
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,000
 So it's bizarre.

291
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
 It's which eye it looks at you with.

292
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,000
 Oh.

293
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:42,000
 So horses look at negative or threatening sites with their left eye

294
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,000
 and positive ones with their right eye.

295
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,000
 Really?

296
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,000
 So if you come back, you know what the horse thinks of you,

297
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,000
 depending on which eye it looks at you with.

298
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,000
 That's really interesting.

299
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:53,000
 So horses understand human facial expressions.

300
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,000
 Yeah.

301
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,000
 It's interesting because a lot of animals, if you smile at them,

302
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:59,000
 they'll see the teeth and they think you're being aggressive,

303
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,000
 for instance.

304
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,000
 Right.

305
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,000
 So interesting.

306
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,000
 Yeah.

307
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:07,000
 Yeah.

308
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:10,000
 Do you know that it was illegal to dress up as a horse in Scotland

309
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,000
 in the 7th century?

310
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,000
 Really?

311
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,000
 Yeah.

312
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:18,000
 In fact, it was forbidden for any man to dress as a horse

313
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:23,000
 or a wild beast and dance anti-clockwise during January.

314
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,000
 Yeah.

315
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,000
 It was demonic.

316
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:28,000
 Well, that's the thing about dressing up as an animal

317
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:31,000
 was to let your demonic side out.

318
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,000
 Yeah.

319
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,000
 Yeah, absolutely.

320
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,000
 It was seen as very anti-Catholic and stuff.

321
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:39,000
 St Augustine wrote that anyone carrying on that most filthy

322
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:43,000
 practice of dressing like a horse should be punished most severely.

323
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,000
 Oh, wow.

324
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:48,000
 But as soon as the 1st of February hits, knock yourself out.

325
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:52,000
 We're doing No Horse January this year again.

326
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,000
 That's fine.

327
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:02,000
 OK, it is time for fact number two.

328
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,000
 And that is my fact.

329
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:08,000
 My fact this week is that this June of 2023, the 6 millionth,

330
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:16,000
 666,666 English language Wikipedia article was created.

331
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:19,000
 And that page was an entry for SatanCon.

332
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,000
 Ooh.

333
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,000
 Yeah.

334
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:25,000
 You've got to imagine, obviously, that they were aiming to land that.

335
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,000
 But that's really hard, right?

336
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,000
 So SatanCon being--

337
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,000
 Is that like Comic-Con but with devils?

338
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,000
 It pretty much is.

339
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:35,000
 Yeah, it's set up by the Satanic Temple, who are a non-theistic

340
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:38,000
 organization, and they have this annual convention.

341
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,000
 It was in Boston this year.

342
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,000
 It was on April 28th, which is my birthday.

343
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,000
 So that's very exciting.

344
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,000
 Congratulations.

345
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,000
 Thank you very much.

346
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,000
 It's quite new, SatanCon.

347
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,000
 I think it's only been held twice, I think.

348
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:53,000
 So this year was in Boston at the Boston Marriott Hotel.

349
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:56,000
 So good on the Marriott, because you would think,

350
00:14:56,000 --> 00:15:00,000
 oh, maybe there'll be a reputational concern if we host SatanCon.

351
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,000
 But they said, no, you come and have the conference here.

352
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,000
 And I think that's really good.

353
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:07,000
 Because, no, but the first one got lots of placards

354
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:10,000
 and it got lots of protests outside SatanCon 1,

355
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:13,000
 you know, in 2022, denouncing Satan and this sort of thing.

356
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:17,000
 Even though the Satanic Temple, they don't believe in Satan.

357
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,000
 They don't--

358
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,000
 They say they lie.

359
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,000
 That's the point.

360
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,000
 That is the point of Satan.

361
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,000
 Yeah, really good point.

362
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,000
 Yeah.

363
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,000
 Oh, that's worry.

364
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:28,000
 Because they do run Satan Afterschool Clubs.

365
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:32,000
 And I was thinking of my kids.

366
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,000
 And even if they--

367
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,000
 Even if they don't believe in Satan,

368
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,000
 they're not helping themselves by calling themselves

369
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,000
 the Satanic Temple, are they?

370
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,000
 No.

371
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:43,000
 They're sort of more of a free speech organization, really.

372
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,000
 That's what they say, Andy.

373
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,000
 But no, you're right.

374
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,000
 It's all such a good point.

375
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,000
 You're being sucked in.

376
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,000
 Oh, God, I've fallen right for it.

377
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,000
 Satan Prince of Lies, that's his name.

378
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:53,000
 Why did I get this pentagram tattooed on my back?

379
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:56,000
 [LAUGHTER]

380
00:15:56,000 --> 00:16:00,000
 They use the proper Latin greeting instead of saying Hail Satan,

381
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,000
 who they don't believe in.

382
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,000
 I'm really on the temple side.

383
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,000
 They say Ave Satana.

384
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,000
 What's that mean?

385
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,000
 Hail Satan.

386
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,000
 Hail Satan.

387
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:14,000
 [LAUGHTER]

388
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,000
 Yeah.

389
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:18,000
 But it scans the same as have a banana, which I really like.

390
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,000
 Ave Satana.

391
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:20,000
 That's how you can remember it.

392
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,000
 Yeah, yeah.

393
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,000
 I like it.

394
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,000
 I think they're good.

395
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,000
 Oh, do you?

396
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,000
 Yeah, they're kind of rationalistic.

397
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,000
 Well, there's a few of them around down there who claim to not be

398
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:30,000
 interested in Satan, but are called the Church of Satan or whatever.

399
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,000
 Yeah.

400
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,000
 Yeah.

401
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,000
 And a lot of them are like just trying to take the piss out

402
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:37,000
 of the government, out of the church, out of all that kind of stuff.

403
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:38,000
 Yeah.

404
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:41,000
 In lockdown, I started presenting a religious program

405
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:44,000
 on Sunday mornings called Sunday Morning Live.

406
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:48,000
 And we, under the BBC, had to interview every religion

407
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,000
 that's recognized as a religion.

408
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,000
 Oh.

409
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:53,000
 I didn't actually do it, but they interviewed the Satanists.

410
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,000
 Really?

411
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,000
 After--

412
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:56,000
 Oh.

413
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,000
 Is that like a proper religion then in the UK?

414
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,000
 Yeah.

415
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:00,000
 All right.

416
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,000
 Yeah, Wiccan.

417
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:02,000
 Wiccan, yeah.

418
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,000
 And the lady who came, I didn't talk to her, actually,

419
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,000
 but she came.

420
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:06,000
 She'd been up all night.

421
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,000
 [LAUGHTER]

422
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:08,000
 Doing what?

423
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,000
 In the woods with her horse?

424
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,000
 Having satanic sex in the woods.

425
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:12,000
 No.

426
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,000
 Basically, yeah.

427
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:18,000
 And the big issue for Sunday Morning Live was that she wasn't wearing a bra

428
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,000
 and you could see really--

429
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,000
 see her nipples really, really clearly.

430
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,000
 Oh, wait.

431
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,000
 Was it radio or TV?

432
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,000
 TV.

433
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:26,000
 Or three of TV.

434
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,000
 [LAUGHTER]

435
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:28,000
 So it's like, how are we going to--

436
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,000
 Why would that story be relevant if it was radio, Andy?

437
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:34,000
 [LAUGHTER]

438
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:38,000
 How are we going to gaffotate the witches' nips?

439
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,000
 [LAUGHTER]

440
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,000
 Wow.

441
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,000
 So the Wiccan thing is a bit different, yeah.

442
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:43,000
 Was she satanic?

443
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,000
 Like, did you feel that she was pushing the Satan?

444
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,000
 I didn't particularly talk to her, no.

445
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,000
 I think they-- yeah, no.

446
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,000
 No, I don't-- no, I don't think so.

447
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:52,000
 [LAUGHTER]

448
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,000
 I mean, I didn't talk to--

449
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:56,000
 I don't know what happened, but it's like, whatever spell she put on you,

450
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,000
 it just suddenly kicked in.

451
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,000
 [LAUGHTER]

452
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:03,000
 Honestly, I'm a bit scared of witches and Satan.

453
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:04,000
 Yeah.

454
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,000
 So is David Bowie, so it's fine.

455
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,000
 [LAUGHTER]

456
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:08,000
 He was once exercised.

457
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:12,000
 He got someone to do spells of protection.

458
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,000
 Right.

459
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:16,000
 Well, he used to collect his urine and little bottles, kind of like how Hugh Hefner

460
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,000
 did, because he was worried that witches were going to steal them

461
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,000
 and do black magic with them.

462
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,000
 Oh, no.

463
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,000
 But he would collect all of it.

464
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,000
 What do you mean?

465
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,000
 He kind of collected all of his urine and bottles to prevent theft.

466
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:26,000
 [LAUGHTER]

467
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,000
 Because that's such an unsustainable--

468
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:29,000
 I mean, I know he was rich.

469
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:30,000
 I know he was like a wealthy guy.

470
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:34,000
 If someone had enough money for jars to sustain every passing of urine--

471
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,000
 Imagine how much it would fetch now.

472
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,000
 And I absolutely would buy some of it.

473
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:39,000
 Oh, yeah, yeah, of course.

474
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:42,000
 But I also think, like, if you just piss it down the toilet,

475
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:45,000
 that's probably safer than keeping it in bottles in your house.

476
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:46,000
 That's so much safer.

477
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,000
 Yeah.

478
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:48,000
 Yeah, it must be, right?

479
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,000
 Because once you've got it in bottles, people--

480
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,000
 No, but you're forgetting about filming trailers.

481
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,000
 Because--

482
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:54,000
 Oh, yeah.

483
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:58,000
 Yeah, and filming-- because there was-- I think I might have made this up.

484
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,000
 [LAUGHTER]

485
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:05,000
 But I feel like there was an issue of people going to Justin Timberlake's

486
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:08,000
 filming trailer and trying to steal his turrets out there.

487
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,000
 Oh, because it's held in a tank.

488
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,000
 Yeah, yeah, of course, yeah.

489
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:12,000
 No.

490
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,000
 Did I dream that?

491
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:14,000
 [LAUGHTER]

492
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,000
 That would be so worrying if I did.

493
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:17,000
 I feel that was a thing, then.

494
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:18,000
 And what were they going to do with it?

495
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:19,000
 Were they going to clone it?

496
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:20,000
 eBay?

497
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:21,000
 All right.

498
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:25,000
 No, no, just use it and use it for spells, I guess, was his--

499
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,000
 we've got to remember that this is a guy who was so coked off his head

500
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,000
 that he was collecting in his own piss in bottles.

501
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:32,000
 I don't think there was logic to his reasoning.

502
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,000
 I think he just was scared of a--

503
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:37,000
 But there is a whole thing of collecting, you know, hairs and stuff,

504
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:38,000
 isn't there?

505
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,000
 Well, yeah, I mean, so that's a thing.

506
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:43,000
 So Yoko Ono used to be seen as someone that potentially--

507
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:45,000
 you know, she had an album called Yes, I Am a Witch

508
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:48,000
 because she was presented as someone who might be a witch.

509
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:52,000
 And she bought a single mustache hair off of Salvador Dali.

510
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:55,000
 She paid him for it, and he sent it over in a box.

511
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:58,000
 And years later, it was revealed by the partner of Salvador Dali

512
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:01,000
 that he was so scared that she was going to use it for witchcraft

513
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:04,000
 that he ended up sending a painted bit of a blade of grass

514
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,000
 that he picked from his lawn.

515
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,000
 But she never noticed, according to the story.

516
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,000
 But he was petrified that Yoko Ono--

517
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:13,000
 Yeah, well, there was the whole satanic panic, wasn't there?

518
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:15,000
 Was it '70s and '80s?

519
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,000
 Were they thought McDonald's were haunted?

520
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:18,000
 Possessed?

521
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:19,000
 McDonald's?

522
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:21,000
 No, the whole satanic panic where--

523
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:24,000
 McDonald's got a letter from a woman in Ohio

524
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:28,000
 asking why the owner, Ray Crock,

525
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,000
 was a financial supporter of the Church of Satan.

526
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:33,000
 And it was a rumor that just spread--

527
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:36,000
 she said she'd seen him on the Phil Donahue show

528
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:39,000
 saying he supported the Church of Satan.

529
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,000
 And he hadn't said that.

530
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:44,000
 But she told her pastor, and her pastor put it in the church's newsletter,

531
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:47,000
 which was called Moments of Sunshine.

532
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:52,000
 And very quickly, that spread across America

533
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,000
 via church newsletters.

534
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:57,000
 So McDonald's had to send executives out to these churches

535
00:20:57,000 --> 00:21:01,000
 with sworn statements insisting that Crock never said those things.

536
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,000
 It was a real panic, wasn't it?

537
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:07,000
 And the expert on it these days is a guy called Dr. David Frankfurter.

538
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:12,000
 And what he thinks is it was basically like a sort of a loop

539
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:15,000
 where you would have these evangelical Christians saying,

540
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:16,000
 "This is happening."

541
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:19,000
 And then people were using hypnotic regression techniques

542
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:24,000
 to try and remember things that they supposedly suppressed in their lives.

543
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,000
 And then really what they would do is kind of say

544
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,000
 what the hypnotists wanted them to say.

545
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,000
 You just had this kind of feedback loop

546
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:33,000
 that eventually there was, in theory, in some of the newspapers they were saying,

547
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:36,000
 there were thousands of these Satanists around America doing this.

548
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:37,000
 Yeah.

549
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:39,000
 I've got a fact for you.

550
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:40,000
 Okay.

551
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:45,000
 In 2021, in the UK, more babies were named Lucifer than Nigel.

552
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:47,000
 Do you have the numbers? Do we know how many?

553
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:48,000
 15 Lucifers?

554
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:49,000
 Yeah.

555
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:50,000
 No more than two Nigels.

556
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:51,000
 No!

557
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:52,000
 Oh, my word.

558
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,000
 It doesn't appear on the list.

559
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:54,000
 You know that thing where if there are under three,

560
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,000
 they don't say how many there are.

561
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:59,000
 And do we think that it's because Nigel is associated with evil these days?

562
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:03,000
 [LAUGHTER]

563
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:06,000
 Did you come across a thing of 666, though?

564
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:07,000
 Yeah.

565
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:09,000
 So I'd always thought that 666, the number of the beast,

566
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:12,000
 was about the number of perfection being seven,

567
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:15,000
 and so six being imperfection.

568
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:17,000
 That's what I thought it was.

569
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:23,000
 But then, today, I discovered that there's a thing called isosephi,

570
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:25,000
 which is letters equivalent to numbers.

571
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:29,000
 And apparently, this was very, very common in 1st and 2nd century CE.

572
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:35,000
 So you would quite often refer to people with a number.

573
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:42,000
 So a joke was, by Seatonius, a calculation knew Nero his mother slew.

574
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:46,000
 And in this case, the emperor Nero equals 1005,

575
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:49,000
 which is the same value as the phrase his mother slew.

576
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:54,000
 And apparently, most people think if you say 666, it stands for seasonero.

577
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:59,000
 So in some early versions of the Bible, in Revelations from Revelations 13,

578
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:03,000
 the Latin version has the numbers being 616.

579
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:04,000
 Right.

580
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:08,000
 And that's because in Latin, Nero is 616, not 666.

581
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:12,000
 And the reason we think that is because Revelation was written by very early Christians.

582
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:15,000
 It's one of the earliest of the New Testament books.

583
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:19,000
 And really, they were just being persecuted by Nero, so they saw him as the devil.

584
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:25,000
 But he was actually a good guy.

585
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:27,000
 Well, I wouldn't go quite that far.

586
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:29,000
 I mean, it depends what side you're on.

587
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:31,000
 If you're on Nero's side, he's a great guy.

588
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:38,000
 He used to drink an energy drink that was made by soaking roasted dung in vinegar.

589
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:42,000
 But that's still how they, that's Red Bull, that is.

590
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,000
 Now that's Steven Seagal's energy drink.

591
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:45,000
 Have you seen those adverts?

592
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:46,000
 Oh, yeah.

593
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:47,000
 They're unbelievable.

594
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:48,000
 I've not seen the ads.

595
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:49,000
 You've got to see the ads.

596
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:50,000
 What are they called?

597
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:51,000
 You've got to see the ads.

598
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:52,000
 What's it called?

599
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:53,000
 I can't remember.

600
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:54,000
 I used to drink it all the time.

601
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:55,000
 Steven, what?

602
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:56,000
 Yeah, I don't know why.

603
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:57,000
 Why?

604
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:58,000
 I went through a period.

605
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:01,000
 Well, my local corner shop just stocked things like Marley's Mellow Mood,

606
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:03,000
 which was a Bob Marley energy drink, but it was sort of an opposite.

607
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:04,000
 What?

608
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:05,000
 A Bob Marley energy drink.

609
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:06,000
 Yeah.

610
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:08,000
 It was a sort of Bob Marley anti-energy drink.

611
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:13,000
 And it said on the side, "Whatever you do, don't drive a truck after two of these."

612
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:19,000
 This store, it had all the collection of every celebrity's weird...

613
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:22,000
 What's amazing, Dan, is that this was at the end of your street.

614
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:25,000
 You would be the only person in the world who would buy this stuff.

615
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:26,000
 Yeah, exactly.

616
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:27,000
 They probably only...

617
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:29,000
 They were like, "Oh, we accidentally ordered this one time."

618
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:32,000
 "Oh, it's selling every week for this one guy."

619
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:33,000
 Let's keep getting it.

620
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:34,000
 It was really powerful, his drink.

621
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:35,000
 Yeah.

622
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:36,000
 Yeah, the Steven Seagal one.

623
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:38,000
 It's the most misogynistic advert I've ever seen.

624
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:39,000
 Oh, really?

625
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:41,000
 And he's not even bothered to turn up.

626
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:42,000
 You just have to watch it.

627
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:44,000
 Okay, that wasn't on the can.

628
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:45,000
 It's awful.

629
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:46,000
 It's in there.

630
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:50,000
 I can't believe I was the sole funder of that ad.

631
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:59,000
 It is time for fact number three, and that is Andy.

632
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:04,000
 My fact is that roughly 3% of our entire planet is called Jason.

633
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:08,000
 How much is called Nigel?

634
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:09,000
 I'm shrinking about it.

635
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:10,000
 Yeah, so this is an amazing...

636
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:11,000
 Okay, this is amazing, right?

637
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:15,000
 Now, this is not 3% of all people on the planet are called Jason, right?

638
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:20,000
 This is 3% of the Earth itself is named Jason.

639
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:21,000
 By whom?

640
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:22,000
 By...

641
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:23,000
 Jason?

642
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:25,000
 By geologists and seismologists.

643
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:26,000
 So they're...

644
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:29,000
 Okay, this is a bit technical, but there are these two mysterious...

645
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:31,000
 Sound like Dan when I read this out.

646
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:36,000
 There are these mysterious structures inside the Earth, right?

647
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:37,000
 There are two of them, okay?

648
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:39,000
 And they are these massive blobs.

649
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:44,000
 They're called LLSVPs, large, low shear velocity provinces, right?

650
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:48,000
 Now, there's one beneath Africa and there's one under the Pacific.

651
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:52,000
 And that's obviously a very technical name for them.

652
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:53,000
 And they're not very well known about.

653
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:59,000
 They're not very well researched because they are where the mantle of the Earth meets the core of the Earth, okay?

654
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:01,000
 So the Earth goes crust, not very much.

655
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:03,000
 Mantle, quite a bit.

656
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:04,000
 Core, quite a bit more.

657
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:08,000
 And they're at the junction point between the mantle and the core.

658
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:09,000
 So they're really hard to research.

659
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:13,000
 And the researchers have named them Tuzo and Jason.

660
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:15,000
 They are billions of years old and between them they are...

661
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:16,000
 Both blocs.

662
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:19,000
 That's true.

663
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:21,000
 They're named after two geological scientists.

664
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:22,000
 So they are, yeah.

665
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:24,000
 And we don't know what they are.

666
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:28,000
 They might be offcuts from another planet, which is exciting.

667
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:32,000
 There's a theoretical planet called Thea from four and a half billion years ago,

668
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:36,000
 which might have crashed into Earth and might have been subsumed.

669
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:37,000
 That's possible.

670
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:38,000
 Right.

671
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:40,000
 Yeah, we don't know exactly what they are.

672
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:42,000
 But they are incredible and they're there.

673
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:43,000
 And this...

674
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:46,000
 I don't know why I'm having to justify their existence.

675
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:47,000
 This is proper...

676
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:49,000
 I just spent 15 minutes talking about Satan.

677
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:53,000
 These are real geological structures in the planet.

678
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:54,000
 They're awesome.

679
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:56,000
 No, yeah, it was wonderful.

680
00:26:56,000 --> 00:27:01,000
 Why aren't you more excited?

681
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:05,000
 In all honesty, it's because an eBay auction came up on my phone

682
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:08,000
 saying you got three minutes to bid, so I suddenly was focused on that.

683
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:09,000
 Are you joking?

684
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:12,000
 I didn't bid in the end.

685
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:15,000
 How much was it for that swimming pool of David Bowie's bottled urine?

686
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:18,000
 Are we saying that there's...

687
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:20,000
 Because the description I read is that it's...

688
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:24,000
 There's mountains there that are taller than Mount Everest.

689
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:25,000
 Yes.

690
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:27,000
 But what does that mean?

691
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:30,000
 It's not the Hollow Earth we're talking about, right?

692
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:32,000
 There's no space around the mountains.

693
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:33,000
 Oh!

694
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:36,000
 It's just different rock that might have been this other mystery planet.

695
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:41,000
 Yeah, in fact, near Jason and Tuzo, there are these enormous mega mountains

696
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:43,000
 and they're at that junction point as well.

697
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:47,000
 They are called ultra low velocity zones and it's this weird boundary zone.

698
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:49,000
 I did read something, I can't get my head around this.

699
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:53,000
 Scientists claim that the gap between the core and the mantle

700
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:57,000
 is bigger than the change between rock and air.

701
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:59,000
 No, I can't understand that.

702
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:01,000
 It's because of the high pressure, right?

703
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:02,000
 Right, yeah, yeah.

704
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:03,000
 That is amazing.

705
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:07,000
 And they're only found because scientists can track earthquakes through the Earth

706
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:11,000
 and you spot where the reverberations, how long they take to get through the Earth

707
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:14,000
 and you can build up a profile very slowly and carefully

708
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:18,000
 of what the different structures are based on how fast waves travel.

709
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:20,000
 This is just news to me that...

710
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:21,000
 Right.

711
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:23,000
 Because last time I did geography, I was a child

712
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:25,000
 and I thought it was...

713
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:27,000
 Then there was magma.

714
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:31,000
 The mantle is much more fluid and then there's an outer liquid core in it in a solid core.

715
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:32,000
 So, yeah.

716
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:34,000
 There's space around Jason.

717
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:35,000
 No, that was me.

718
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:36,000
 There's no space at all.

719
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:37,000
 There's no space at all.

720
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:39,000
 So in what sense is Jason a mountain?

721
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:41,000
 It's a different type of rock.

722
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:44,000
 You've got the sort of quite liquid mantle

723
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:47,000
 but you've got much more solid rock, which is this Jason stuff, is that right?

724
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:48,000
 That's right, yeah, yeah.

725
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:51,000
 But I think it's really interesting that these are named after blokes

726
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:54,000
 because actually quite a lot of this science was done by women.

727
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:56,000
 Right, so a...

728
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:58,000
 Sorry, did you say you were surprised?

729
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:01,000
 Yeah, it's so weird.

730
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:02,000
 It's so weird.

731
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:04,000
 Everything else has happened in history.

732
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:06,000
 It's bizarre.

733
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:08,000
 One person, for instance, Inga Lehmann,

734
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:11,000
 she was the first to work out that the Earth had a solid core.

735
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:14,000
 And what it was, again, it's like the vibrations going through the Earth

736
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:16,000
 and they realised there must have been a core there

737
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:18,000
 because the vibrations would come after an earthquake

738
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:21,000
 and then if you were exactly opposite the earthquake, you wouldn't see them.

739
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:23,000
 And so there must have been something liquid there.

740
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:26,000
 But actually, she noticed that if you looked at seismographs,

741
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:29,000
 there were really, really tiny amounts of vibrations.

742
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:31,000
 So it wasn't completely dark.

743
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:36,000
 And what she realised was that this was because there was also a solid core

744
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:38,000
 inside the liquid core.

745
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:40,000
 But they all thought that, you know, she must be wrong

746
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:43,000
 and it must have been like a discrepancy in the seismographs.

747
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:44,000
 The seismographs must be wrong

748
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:47,000
 because this woman can't possibly be right that there's an extra core in there.

749
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:50,000
 But it turned out like in 1970.

750
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:52,000
 I think she was still alive.

751
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:54,000
 But we found out, yeah, we found out that it was true.

752
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:56,000
 Wow. Amazing.

753
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:58,000
 So I've got a couple of things on Jason Statham.

754
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:01,000
 Me too.

755
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:07,000
 I don't know, is it like a sandwich you got from your local shop?

756
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:11,000
 I was just looking into notable Jason's

757
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:13,000
 because I thought that's the territory.

758
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:15,000
 Are you joking?

759
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:19,000
 I've got eight pages of dense geological data.

760
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:22,000
 Jason Statham is in Meg too.

761
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:24,000
 He's massive.

762
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:25,000
 Yeah, he is. He's incredible.

763
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:28,000
 So he was filming Expendables 3, I think it was.

764
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:29,000
 I've got this too.

765
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:32,000
 Have you got this? Amazing story. Amazing story.

766
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:37,000
 We're literally going from the structure of the entire

767
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:40,000
 all life, all of everything we've ever known.

768
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:42,000
 These amazing scientists.

769
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:44,000
 Yeah, sorry, the Expendables 3.

770
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:45,000
 He's in a car, yeah.

771
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:47,000
 You listen to this and tell me you're not amazed.

772
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:50,000
 He's in a car and he's doing a scene and suddenly...

773
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:52,000
 He likes to do his own stunts.

774
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:54,000
 Loves to do his own stunts, Jason, doesn't he?

775
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:56,000
 Yeah, and he needs to hit the brakes

776
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:58,000
 because he needs to stop before there's a cliff

777
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:00,000
 which drops 60 feet into the black sea.

778
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:02,000
 Gosh, 60 feet? 60 feet.

779
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:05,000
 That's nearly as much as the 2,000 miles of mantle

780
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:08,000
 between the crust and the core.

781
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:14,000
 So the brakes fail, Statham's in the car

782
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:16,000
 and it goes off the cliff.

783
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:18,000
 This is a Hollywood film.

784
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:21,000
 He's plunging 60 feet into...

785
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:23,000
 A three-ton stunt truck.

786
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:24,000
 A three-ton stunt truck.

787
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:25,000
 Sorry, he's driving the truck.

788
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:26,000
 He's driving the truck.

789
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:28,000
 He's driving the truck. We're not listening?

790
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:32,000
 And so then he should crash.

791
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:34,000
 Anyone else, any other of the Expendables,

792
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:36,000
 you put Stallone in there, you put Schwarzenegger.

793
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:38,000
 They would die in that moment, right?

794
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:42,000
 Statham manages to leap out of the car

795
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:45,000
 and successfully dive into the ocean

796
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:47,000
 and then comes up and he's all okay.

797
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:48,000
 And why is he okay, Sally?

798
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:51,000
 He's okay because before he became an actor,

799
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:54,000
 he was a competitive diver, genuinely.

800
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:56,000
 And he's done a lot of free diving

801
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:58,000
 and has got a lot of scuba experience.

802
00:31:58,000 --> 00:31:59,000
 Exactly.

803
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:01,000
 But he was very, very good at diving,

804
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:03,000
 but not quite good enough to make the Olympic team,

805
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:04,000
 so he decided to branch out.

806
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:06,000
 Exactly, but he did represent Britain

807
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:08,000
 in the Commonwealth Games in 1990.

808
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:10,000
 Oh, so it's not like scuba diving, it's highboard diving.

809
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:12,000
 Highboard diving, which he used to practice

810
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:14,000
 in Crystal Palace as a highboard there

811
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:17,000
 and they have a pool there where Tom Daly would practice as well.

812
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:19,000
 And before Tom Daly, Jason Statham, he would be there.

813
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:20,000
 That's incredible.

814
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:22,000
 So Jason Statham, that's really interesting

815
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:24,000
 because Jason Statham, that means it might have been helpful

816
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:32,000
 in the first attempt to dig down into the Earth's mantle in 1961.

817
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:37,000
 So this was a thing called Project Mohole, okay?

818
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:39,000
 It was an attempt to find the lower limit of the Earth's crust,

819
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:42,000
 which is very, very thick on land and much thinner over the ocean.

820
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:45,000
 The USA was losing the space race in 1961,

821
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:48,000
 the Soviets were way ahead, and so the USA said,

822
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:51,000
 "Well, just dig instead and we'll do better at digging

823
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:53,000
 and that'll be our new thing."

824
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:58,000
 So they tried to get down beyond this thin layer of crust

825
00:32:58,000 --> 00:32:59,000
 where it meets the mantle,

826
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:02,000
 which is a point called the Mohovovich discontinuity.

827
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:04,000
 It didn't work.

828
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:06,000
 So they went into the ocean.

829
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:08,000
 The weirdest thing was that there was a ship

830
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:11,000
 which was sent to do the drilling operation

831
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:13,000
 to keep it stable in the same bit of the ocean.

832
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:15,000
 Their solution was they fitted propellers

833
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:17,000
 all the way around the outside

834
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:19,000
 and they just fired them all at the same time.

835
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:21,000
 That's brilliant.

836
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:23,000
 They probably needed marine biologists on the boat, right,

837
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:25,000
 in order to do the science.

838
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:27,000
 I'm not falling for it.

839
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:30,000
 Did you know that Jason Momoa,

840
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:35,000
 who became Aquaman later in his career,

841
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:39,000
 first studied marine biology when he was at university

842
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:42,000
 before transferring to wildlife biology?

843
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:45,000
 That is so interesting, Dad. Thank you.

844
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:48,000
 They did have a kind of hero beginning with Jay

845
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:50,000
 and Jay named Hero there

846
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:52,000
 because John Steinbeck was present of Mice and Men.

847
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:54,000
 John Steinbeck.

848
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:57,000
 He was there kind of writing about it,

849
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:59,000
 but sadly it didn't work.

850
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:01,000
 Gosh, you weren't kidding.

851
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:03,000
 In the dressing room he said,

852
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:08,000
 "I've got 15 minutes brilliant material on Jason."

853
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:10,000
 There is a bit of advance this year.

854
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:12,000
 This is quite sort of geeky now,

855
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:14,000
 but scientists have just extracted a chunk of the mantle

856
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:16,000
 for the first time.

857
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:18,000
 Of Earth's mantle?

858
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:20,000
 We're trying to work out how to do it, right?

859
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:22,000
 And they realized they don't go to the mantle,

860
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:25,000
 go to where rock from the mantle has been pushed

861
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:27,000
 above its normal resting place.

862
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:30,000
 So they drilled into an underwater mountain,

863
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:33,000
 but like a normal underwater mountain is in

864
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:35,000
 at the bottom of the mid-Atlantic ridge.

865
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:37,000
 They drilled in slightly sideways

866
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:39,000
 and they have a core of mantle rock,

867
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:41,000
 which is a kilometre long,

868
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:43,000
 and they've extracted that core

869
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:45,000
 and that allowed them to study all sorts of things

870
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:47,000
 about the deep Earth.

871
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:49,000
 So cool.

872
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:51,000
 That's incredible.

873
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:53,000
 All I've got going on here is,

874
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:55,000
 "You can keep it on your mantle piece."

875
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:58,000
 I just can't join in with the science stuff, really.

876
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:03,000
 Well, Jason Statham.

877
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:05,000
 I do have a fact about Jason Statham.

878
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:08,000
 Oh, look who goes crawling back to the other side.

879
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:13,000
 He fits very well as in he would be a great action hero,

880
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:15,000
 even with his, you know,

881
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:17,000
 his human name, as in his name,

882
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:19,000
 is a good name for an action hero.

883
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:21,000
 So is it not his real name, Jason Statham?

884
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:23,000
 No, it is his real name, as far as I know.

885
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:25,000
 But my point is that action heroes

886
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:27,000
 tend to have names beginning with J.

887
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:29,000
 James Bond, Jason Bourne,

888
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:31,000
 John Wick, Jack Reacher, John McLean,

889
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:33,000
 John James Rambo.

890
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:35,000
 Oh, yeah.

891
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:37,000
 And there was a study, a brilliant study,

892
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:39,000
 by a writer at Slate called Demetria Glace,

893
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:41,000
 and she studied 2,000 action movies,

894
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:43,000
 pretty much every modern Western action movie

895
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:46,000
 with a male sort of single everyman protagonist.

896
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:49,000
 A third of them had names beginning with J,

897
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:51,000
 which is very unusual.

898
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:54,000
 Do you know that the Earth is younger on the inside

899
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:56,000
 than it is on the outside?

900
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:58,000
 What?

901
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:00,000
 So when you get to the mantle level up here...

902
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:02,000
 Judas.

903
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:04,000
 That would be a good name for an action movie.

904
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:06,000
 Judas, great action story, yeah.

905
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:08,000
 This is like Freaky Friday.

906
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:10,000
 Yeah.

907
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:12,000
 So as we saw in the movie Interstellar,

908
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:15,000
 where when Matthew McConaughey is travelling out into space,

909
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:17,000
 gravity distorts time, doesn't it?

910
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:19,000
 And there's a reason that we say that

911
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:21,000
 when astronauts are in space, they're almost time travellers,

912
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:24,000
 because they age differently, because time travels differently.

913
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:26,000
 If you were at the core of our planet,

914
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:29,000
 and that means then the core of our planet itself,

915
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:31,000
 is travelling at a different time.

916
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:34,000
 Two and a half years younger than the rest of our planet,

917
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:36,000
 because gravity is so intense down there,

918
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:38,000
 that it slowed down time.

919
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:40,000
 That's pretty cool.

920
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:42,000
 Whatever.

921
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:44,000
 OK, let me tell you one thing about geology,

922
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:47,000
 which this will totally blow your mind, right?

923
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:49,000
 So there's a place called the Heart Mountain

924
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:51,000
 in Northwest America.

925
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:55,000
 And I'm talking quite a lot of millions of years ago,

926
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:58,000
 but at one stage that mountain moved

927
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:01,000
 62 miles in half an hour.

928
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:03,000
 Really? The entire mountain.

929
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:05,000
 What? Isn't that amazing?

930
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:07,000
 So there's a load of basically magma,

931
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:09,000
 there's a big sort of river of magma there,

932
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:12,000
 a load of water got into it, there was a massive explosion,

933
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:16,000
 and the entire mountain moved at 100 miles an hour.

934
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:18,000
 Oh, my word. No.

935
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:20,000
 But half an hour.

936
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:22,000
 We're talking millions and millions and millions of years ago.

937
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:24,000
 Oh, this was last year.

938
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:27,000
 So you just go skiing and you're like, oh, my God!

939
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:29,000
 Whoa!

940
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:33,000
 Are we there yet? It's right here.

941
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:35,000
 Oh, fuck. No. Sorry, kids.

942
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:43,000
 OK, it is time for our final fact of the show,

943
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:45,000
 and that is James.

944
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:48,000
 OK, my fact this week is that you could tell the social status

945
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:53,000
 of an ancient Egyptian man by the colour of his condom.

946
00:37:55,000 --> 00:38:01,000
 I mean, surely you would have an inkling before you got to see him.

947
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:05,000
 Or it's a shock, isn't it?

948
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:07,000
 You told me you were a pharaoh!

949
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:12,000
 It's bizarre, isn't it?

950
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:14,000
 I've read this in a couple of places.

951
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:17,000
 One is an article in the Indian Journal of Urology

952
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:19,000
 called The Story of the Condom.

953
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:21,000
 One is from an article from the Egypt Museum

954
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:23,000
 who have one of these very, very old condoms.

955
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:26,000
 And basically, they didn't use them for contraception.

956
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:29,000
 They used them to stop diseases,

957
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:32,000
 but they also, an insect bite, nearly.

958
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:36,000
 But they also used them as an insignia of rencore status.

959
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:38,000
 And it was just, when I say condom,

960
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:42,000
 I think some of it might have been more like, almost like cod piece.

961
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:44,000
 Oh, OK. Right.

962
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:46,000
 But they were used against diseases as well.

963
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:49,000
 So, you know, we can technically call them condoms.

964
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:51,000
 And they were made of linen, soaked in olive oil.

965
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:53,000
 OK. And with different colours.

966
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:55,000
 The problem is, of all the sauces,

967
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:57,000
 maybe you guys found this, but if all the sauces that I found,

968
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:59,000
 really good academic sauces,

969
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:01,000
 none of them told you what colour you're aiming for.

970
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:03,000
 Oh, right.

971
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:05,000
 So, I don't know if red was a good one

972
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:07,000
 or if blue was a good one.

973
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:09,000
 They've got Tutankhamun's condom, haven't they?

974
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:11,000
 Do they? Yeah, they do.

975
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:14,000
 Yes, they do. Linen, soaked in olive oil,

976
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:16,000
 impregnated with his DNA.

977
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:18,000
 And it would tie around to his waist.

978
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:21,000
 Tie around to his waist with string.

979
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:23,000
 But it didn't mention what colour it was.

980
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:25,000
 They didn't mention the colour.

981
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:27,000
 Why are we not getting the colour system?

982
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:29,000
 Sometimes the colours don't...

983
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:31,000
 Yeah, right. OK. Gosh.

984
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:33,000
 That's very interesting.

985
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:35,000
 In the course of researching this,

986
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:37,000
 I read probably the weirdest thing I think I've ever read,

987
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:40,000
 which is in ancient Rome, condoms.

988
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:43,000
 And by the way, I haven't found a legit sauce,

989
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:45,000
 but it appears in so many...

990
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:47,000
 No, it appears in so many places.

991
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:50,000
 They used, apparently, an ancient Roman

992
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:52,000
 who was victorious in a battle

993
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:54,000
 and had slain his opponent,

994
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:57,000
 would then make a condom out of the muscle of the opponent.

995
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:59,000
 Oh, don't be daft.

996
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:03,000
 Sauce.

997
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:07,000
 Well, they did use to make condoms out of animal intestines

998
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:09,000
 and bladders in Rome. Yeah.

999
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:11,000
 So it's not impossible.

1000
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:13,000
 It's not impossible. It feels a bit grisly.

1001
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:15,000
 It feels a bit grisly. It's sort of one of those facts

1002
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:17,000
 that I prefer. I'm just going to prefer not to believe.

1003
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:19,000
 Yeah. I know.

1004
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:21,000
 The ancient Egyptians used to use crocodile dung as spermicide,

1005
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:23,000
 did you? Yeah.

1006
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:25,000
 How would you use that? You would use...

1007
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:27,000
 I don't want to think about it.

1008
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:29,000
 Why is no one sleeping with me?

1009
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:31,000
 Uncovered crocodile shit.

1010
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:33,000
 Do you know that William Buckland,

1011
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:35,000
 you know the natural... Yeah, who ate everything, yeah.

1012
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:38,000
 His kids had a hobby horse made out of a dead crocodile.

1013
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:40,000
 Wow. I don't know why that came into my head.

1014
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:42,000
 Yeah.

1015
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:44,000
 My friend Cindy used to have the crocodile

1016
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:46,000
 that was used in crocodile dundee as a...

1017
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:48,000
 Like, they had prop crocodiles,

1018
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:50,000
 and as you went into her house,

1019
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:52,000
 she had the prop crocodile from croc dundee.

1020
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:54,000
 Wow. There's no more iconic prop.

1021
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:56,000
 No, no. Was it a real crocodile?

1022
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:58,000
 No, no. Was it a pretend crocodile?

1023
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:00,000
 No, I think it was a pretend crocodile, yeah.

1024
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:02,000
 Condoms, just quickly. Yeah.

1025
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:05,000
 So the condoms of the 18th century were quite interesting,

1026
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:08,000
 because that was sort of getting towards modern condoms,

1027
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:10,000
 but they're still very primitive.

1028
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:13,000
 So they were made of sheep kycom, okay,

1029
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:15,000
 which is the power that connects the small

1030
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:18,000
 and the large intestine to each other of the sheep.

1031
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:20,000
 And they had to be treated,

1032
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:22,000
 and there was a whole nine-step process

1033
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:25,000
 to make a proper condom out of a sheep's thing, kycom.

1034
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:27,000
 And they were really scarce.

1035
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:29,000
 They were very hard to come by, partly because butchers

1036
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:31,000
 could not be bothered to collect.

1037
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:33,000
 You know, each sheep has one kycom,

1038
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:35,000
 so that's one potential condom per sheep,

1039
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:37,000
 and it was just not worth collecting, basically.

1040
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:40,000
 So people would just use the sheep instead.

1041
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:46,000
 Do you know what the first condom in literature

1042
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:49,000
 was used by the wife of King Minus of Crete,

1043
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:51,000
 who's called Pacifi,

1044
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:54,000
 and she used it to stop herself being harmed

1045
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:56,000
 by King Minus' semen,

1046
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:59,000
 because it contains scorpions and serpents.

1047
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:01,000
 Oh.

1048
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:02,000
 Yeah.

1049
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:04,000
 Maybe we could just watch something tonight, actually.

1050
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:06,000
 Maybe, um...

1051
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:09,000
 Let's watch another episode, actually.

1052
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:10,000
 Yeah, yeah.

1053
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:11,000
 Actually, think about it now. Yeah.

1054
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:14,000
 I discovered that there's a condom make in China

1055
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:16,000
 called "Jisbon,"

1056
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:18,000
 which...

1057
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:20,000
 which is called "Jisbon,"

1058
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:23,000
 because it's after James Bond.

1059
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:25,000
 No, the name's Bond.

1060
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:27,000
 -Jisbon. -Jisbon. Yeah.

1061
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:33,000
 In 2006, a German entrepreneur launched a spray on condom.

1062
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:35,000
 -Yes. -Did you come across that?

1063
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:37,000
 -Yes. -Yeah, but it was stopped by...

1064
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:40,000
 Yeah, the phrasing was a bit unfortunate there.

1065
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:43,000
 -Did you come across that out there? -Yeah.

1066
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:49,000
 And it was stopped short by EU regulations.

1067
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:52,000
 Oh, I read something slightly different about what stopped it.

1068
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:54,000
 So he was called Jan Klauser,

1069
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:57,000
 and he got the idea for it in a car wash,

1070
00:42:57,000 --> 00:42:59,000
 because he, you know, he was...

1071
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:01,000
 I don't know if he must have been in the car

1072
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:03,000
 and it was just being sprayed, and he thought,

1073
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:05,000
 "Oh, maybe. If I... If you, you know,

1074
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:07,000
 "your penis is the car, as it were,

1075
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:09,000
 "and you spray it from every angle with the latex,

1076
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:11,000
 "then you have a perfectly fitted condom."

1077
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:13,000
 -Right. -You know, perfectly fitted every time.

1078
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:16,000
 And he got 30 men to test it,

1079
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:18,000
 and apparently it had exclusively positive reviews.

1080
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:20,000
 It went really well.

1081
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:22,000
 But the drawbacks were that it was quite cold,

1082
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:25,000
 very cold to be just sprayed with this sort of latex liquid,

1083
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:27,000
 and it takes two full minutes to dry.

1084
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:29,000
 -To try. -Yeah.

1085
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:32,000
 But which side is probably not the right size anymore?

1086
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:34,000
 Yeah.

1087
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:36,000
 It still ships internationally, though.

1088
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:38,000
 -Does it? -So it's still not approved by the FDA.

1089
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:40,000
 -It's still for sale? -Oh, no, that's the galactic cap.

1090
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:42,000
 -Sorry. -What's that?

1091
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:45,000
 The galactic cap. Sorry, that's just titchy-titchy,

1092
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:47,000
 like a beanie for your penis.

1093
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:49,000
 Oh, OK. What, like a hipster?

1094
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:51,000
 -Yeah, a hipster one. -What?

1095
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:53,000
 Leaving the shaft. It's not been approved by the FDA,

1096
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:55,000
 but it does ship internationally.

1097
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:57,000
 -Ah, OK. -I don't know how it stays on.

1098
00:43:57,000 --> 00:44:00,000
 Right, OK. It's very exciting.

1099
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:04,000
 You mentioned China earlier with the James Bond thing.

1100
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:07,000
 I was reading about ancient Chinese contraception,

1101
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:10,000
 and because in the early days, there was, you know,

1102
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:12,000
 there was a story that tortoise shell,

1103
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:15,000
 in the same way that the beanie was used, was kind of used for...

1104
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:18,000
 I know, it doesn't quite make sense, and you can't get any further with it.

1105
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:20,000
 And, like, full disclosure,

1106
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:23,000
 the article I got this from used the word "dude" a lot,

1107
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:26,000
 so I don't know how reliable

1108
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:27,000
 this is.

1109
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:30,000
 Were you on the scientific journal "Rab Monthly"?

1110
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:32,000
 -Yeah, yeah, yeah. -That is fine.

1111
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:34,000
 No, no, this was... 'Cause weirdly, it has sources,

1112
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:36,000
 but it's saying that there used to be a thing

1113
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:39,000
 where you were told to reserve ejaculation,

1114
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:41,000
 so that basically is with, you know,

1115
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:43,000
 coitus interrupters, right?

1116
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:45,000
 But the other thing that they said was

1117
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:50,000
 to move the semen back into you, basically.

1118
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:52,000
 So that was a method that was taught.

1119
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:55,000
 So the method was, as point of ejaculation was happening,

1120
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:58,000
 to press a thumb against, in between,

1121
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:01,000
 the scrotum and the anus, and what it would do was...

1122
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:03,000
 My parents are in tonight.

1123
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:07,000
 You're kidding, this happens every time.

1124
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:09,000
 Oh, no, okay, right.

1125
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:12,000
 It's 'cause you mention it in every show we do.

1126
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:14,000
 So why don't you stick your thumb?

1127
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:16,000
 So you put your thumb between your scrotum and your anus,

1128
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:18,000
 and you push, and then it's...

1129
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:20,000
 The idea is that it redirects...

1130
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:23,000
 Middle-playing the hokey-cokey with you.

1131
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:27,000
 It redirects the semen to go up the spine

1132
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:32,000
 through the chakras and into the brain is the idea.

1133
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:34,000
 Because sex...

1134
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:37,000
 I'm sorry, is there a tangible benefit to this procedure?

1135
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:39,000
 What's that you haven't said?

1136
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:41,000
 Because there's an idea that you're expelling something

1137
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:43,000
 from your body which is energy,

1138
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:45,000
 and unless you were receiving the other energy from the human

1139
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:47,000
 that you were having sex with, that was a wasted energy.

1140
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:49,000
 So why not losing your essence?

1141
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:52,000
 Exactly. Again, from somewhere that says awesome a lot

1142
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:55,000
 in the article, and I don't know if it's legit,

1143
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:58,000
 but it seemed legit at the time.

1144
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:04,000
 I find that really scary, that the penis can suck things...

1145
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:06,000
 suck things in.

1146
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:09,000
 I don't know if it can. I don't know if it can.

1147
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:12,000
 I mean, they've got a problem. People are stopping using them.

1148
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:15,000
 So we've got the highest syphilis and gonorrhea rates

1149
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:18,000
 in the UK for years and years, and there was a study done

1150
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:21,000
 about men who believe they're attractive,

1151
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:24,000
 who rate their attractiveness high,

1152
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:27,000
 are much less likely to use a condom.

1153
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:29,000
 Really? Yeah.

1154
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:32,000
 Well, that explains why I've got three on right now.

1155
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:39,000
 How'd you enjoy that one, Mr and Mrs Murray?

1156
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:48,000
 You can also use condoms as a bungee rope.

1157
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:51,000
 What? How much weight can they take?

1158
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:53,000
 Short bungee.

1159
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:56,000
 They can take the weight of Carlo Mosca Donioso,

1160
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:59,000
 who did a 30-metre bungee jump using a string

1161
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:02,000
 of 18,500 condoms.

1162
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:04,000
 Which brand?

1163
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:06,000
 Yeah.

1164
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:08,000
 They didn't snap.

1165
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:11,000
 It took him four months to tie them together.

1166
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:13,000
 Slippery.

1167
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:16,000
 Well, that's what he said. The condoms are slippery.

1168
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:19,000
 If you tied a knot, it would just slip out.

1169
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:22,000
 The testing you'd have to do on that rope to be confident of it.

1170
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:25,000
 Yeah, well, you know what? They used mathematical formulas

1171
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:28,000
 to work out how strong it would have to be.

1172
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:31,000
 So they worked out how many they would need using maths

1173
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:34,000
 rather than using applied stuff.

1174
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:37,000
 But he did say he was 99% sure it would work,

1175
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:40,000
 but his stomach was in the knot for a month before the jump.

1176
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:43,000
 But it worked, and he did manage to do it.

1177
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:46,000
 So, he's one of those guys who's been in condoms in the States.

1178
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:49,000
 It's a brand in South America.

1179
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:52,000
 They have, because they've got a guy there who's like

1180
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:55,000
 the great, you know, the Steve Jobs of condoms, basically.

1181
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:58,000
 Like, he came into the company, he's innovated,

1182
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:01,000
 he's made them thinner than ever before.

1183
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:04,000
 He's one of those guys who's just like constantly,

1184
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:07,000
 and so when they have an invention that's gone through

1185
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:10,000
 the science side of it, kind of like this bungee,

1186
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:13,000
 they have these big couples who are known as the bedroom panel,

1187
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:15,000
 and the condoms get given to them.

1188
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:17,000
 So once or twice a month, they'll get given

1189
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:19,000
 a sort of new condom test design.

1190
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:22,000
 Twice a month? The deviants.

1191
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:27,000
 It's a whole other world, isn't it?

1192
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:31,000
 One for witsom tide, one for mickleness, and you're fine.

1193
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:34,000
 They're slightly smaller Trojans, aren't they, apparently?

1194
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:37,000
 Oh, are they? Apparently, yes.

1195
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:40,000
 Well, I read that on the internet today, dude.

1196
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:43,000
 I also read, like, the flavours were just blew my mind.

1197
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:46,000
 OK, what are they? There's a penis-flavoured condom.

1198
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:55,000
 Are you sure you're wearing a condom?

1199
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:57,000
 Yeah, it's penis-flavoured.

1200
00:48:57,000 --> 00:49:06,000
 OK, that is it.

1201
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:08,000
