 "Hello and welcome to another episode of Little Fish. I'm Andrew Hunter Murray and I'm

2
00:00:18,680 --> 00:00:23,920
 here with Dan Shriver and James Harkin. Andrew Hunter Murray. Hello and we're here to

3
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:28,400
 discuss not our facts but your facts. You've been sending them in. They've been flooding

4
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:35,120
 in to podcast@ky.com and you've sent brilliant facts and we're going to tell you your best ones

5
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:43,280
 now. Clear? Okay, great. Who's got a facts? I've got one. This one is from Ryan Mahoney and

6
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:50,480
 Ryan says best outfield ever. Question mark. It's a fact about baseball and according to Ryan

7
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:58,320
 in 1998, there was Cincinnati Reds baseball team with the players Dimitri Young in left field,

8
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:06,000
 Mike Frank in center field and Chris Steins in right field, thereby giving the world the

9
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:12,880
 Young Frank and Steins outfield. Incredible. Young Frank and Steins. And then he says,

10
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:17,840
 it's alive, which I think must be from the film. Yes, it is. I used to love the film. I haven't

11
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:22,880
 seen Young Frank. It's so good. It's Gene Wilde. Mel Brooks. In his haunt, Marty Feldman. Yes.

12
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:27,200
 With weird eyes. Yes. Hoking out. Well, those were just his eyes. Yeah. Yeah, but they were weird.

13
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:33,040
 Okay. That was his main, he made a living out of those eyes. He's a brilliant comedian. Anyway,

14
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:38,400
 it's such a good film. It's so good. Anyway, what is an outfield? Is it like long leg in cricket?

15
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:44,880
 It's more like your midfield in soccer or your defence in soccer. It's like people who are playing

16
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:52,880
 next to each other. They must have done that. They must have thought. It's such an expensive thing

17
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:59,600
 to just do for a name. You need a good team. I've got a baseball fact that I found yesterday.

18
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:07,360
 Oh, great. So I thought I would throw it and pitch it into the mix. Very nice. And it is that in 1957,

19
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:13,840
 there was a woman watching the Philadelphia Phillies in a baseball match. And she was sat in the crowd

20
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:20,560
 sort of on the side but quite near the front. And there was a stray ball hit into the crowd and it

21
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:27,920
 broke her nose. Okay. And then people kind of came to help her. And then the very next pitch was also

22
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:38,160
 hit into the crowd. And it hit the same woman and broke her knee. Is it that amazing? That's incredible.

23
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:44,480
 James, you've been to a lot of sports games. Has a ball ever made its way to you? Have you ever caught

24
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:49,440
 an object? No, I haven't. I always dream of it. Like if I watch cricket, for instance, especially if

25
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:53,520
 you go and watch like a one day cricket match where they're hitting it into the crowd, you always dream

26
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:57,200
 that that's going to happen. Right. But also James's hands are normally full because he's throwing

27
00:02:57,200 --> 00:03:04,160
 coins at the ref. So that's, you know, that's the closest I got I reckon is a hockey puck. Oh,

28
00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:10,080
 that's, but like as in hit that they have like a perspex screen in front of you and like it hit right

29
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:14,000
 in front of us. Oh, okay. That was the world hockey championship. It's probably good. They've got

30
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:18,560
 those greens because I can imagine that a puck. Yeah. No, that's going to be really sting. That's

31
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:23,680
 going to destroy it. I think it could kill you. Yeah. Really. I would say so. Gosh. I once I once

32
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:29,440
 had an odd moment at a Red Hot Chili Peppers gig. Oh, yeah. So I was really far into the crowd in

33
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:34,800
 the mosh pit quite far back. Let's say there's like 30 humans in front of me if you were doing a line.

34
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:41,600
 And uh, flea, the bass player is drinking from a water bottle, chucks it into the crowd. I stick my

35
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:46,720
 hand up and catch it. Yeah, it's still got water in it and I drink it about 20, 30 minutes later.

36
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:58,800
 Did you get your job afterwards? No, I got line disease. That's text. Otherwise, I'm really a joke.

37
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:05,680
 What happened? You started feeling strange. No drugs with water. No. Okay. Oh,

38
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:11,280
 30 minutes later, the drummer Chad Smith has a tall plastic red cup. You know,

39
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:16,400
 there's used to get a venues. He's drinking from it. He chucks it into the crowd. And with my left hand,

40
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:21,040
 I catch that. It lends at exact same spot. And so I'm standing there with a bottle from flea and

41
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:26,000
 a cup from Chad about 30 people back. And I kept them for years. My mum threw them away when I moved to

42
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:32,640
 the UK. That was a good call. They were really moldy. She threw them out the window. He was just

43
00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:36,240
 happened to be visiting. But your hand did the air. What's this?

44
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:47,200
 That sounds like a dream. No, but it happened. Yeah. I believe you prove just a dream anecdote.

45
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:51,280
 Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. That's really cool. Yeah. Thank you. I've never called any objects.

46
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:58,480
 Let's move on. That was from Ryan. I've got a Ryan fact here. So why don't we jump into that?

47
00:04:58,480 --> 00:05:05,040
 This is sent in by Keith Moser, who writes that in 2010, Ryan Bingham won the Oscar for best

48
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:11,280
 original song for co-writing the weary kind for the movie Crazy Heart. That same year George Clooney

49
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:16,480
 was nominated for best actor for the film Up in the Air in which he plays a character called Ryan

50
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:21,360
 Bingham. So the same name. So I did a tiny bit of extra diving into it to see whether or not there

51
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:27,600
 were more connections between George Clooney and Ryan Bingham. And what I found is that Ryan Bingham

52
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:34,320
 got commercial success for the first time when a song of his was used on the TV show ER, which was

53
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:40,080
 the TV show that really launched George Clooney as well. That's good. Yeah. That's really the only one

54
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:45,040
 except for the fact that Ryan Bingham's Ryan is not really his first name, his real first name is George.

55
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:51,760
 But doesn't that mean that the original fact is wrong? I mean, he goes under the name Ryan Bingham

56
00:05:51,760 --> 00:05:56,400
 as his artist name. Like George Clooney's character was called Ryan Bingham. Yeah. His name is

57
00:05:56,400 --> 00:06:00,000
 George Bingham. Well, I haven't seen the movie. Maybe when he hands his passport over as he

58
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:04,640
 is getting on the plane, it says George Ryan Bingham. Yep. You're on board. Is that what it's about

59
00:06:04,640 --> 00:06:08,880
 up in the air? He just gets in a plane. I think he's a frequent flyer. Yeah. It is genuinely what the film

60
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:14,480
 is about. And it's really good. Is it? Yeah. It's George Clooney and a Kendrick. Yes. And he flies

61
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:18,880
 around the world. I think firing people. Oh, but professionally. It's quite new, James, because you're

62
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:24,960
 a frequent flyer. You know, I'm always firing people. He's trying to fire. He's brilliant. That's

63
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:28,880
 what they should. That's what they should have called a film. Yeah. But his life is a bit up in the

64
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:37,200
 air. So I can see where they went with that. It's sort of frequent fire. It's a job that I think

65
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:42,560
 probably it doesn't exist anymore. Fixed a zoom. Very sad. We've lost so many of our traditions.

66
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:48,400
 Yeah. People who fly around the country firing people. Incredibly handsome man. Like it's the

67
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:53,200
 most handsome person you've seen in your life flies in, fires you, then flies off again. It would

68
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:58,800
 be so insulting. Would you prefer to be fired by someone hideous looking? I think probably

69
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:03,360
 would. Yeah. Yeah. And it'd take the edge off a bit. Yeah. Oh, interesting. I'd go the opposite.

70
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:07,600
 Just to sweeten it. You'd like to be fired by someone handsome? Yeah, I went. Yeah. Well,

71
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:14,800
 Dan, I need to have a chat with you after the show. Here's another fact. This is a great one. It's

72
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:22,960
 from Soam Mukaji and Soam writes that a plane has recently been found after being lost for 13 years.

73
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:29,200
 Okay. It was an air India flight that went missing in a parking bay at the Kolkata airport.

74
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:35,920
 Okay. But they've got they owned it and it just was it was just there. So they just left it in the

75
00:07:35,920 --> 00:07:42,640
 parking. They just left it in the parking bay. Air India just simply forgot. It owes 83,000 pounds

76
00:07:42,640 --> 00:07:48,640
 of parking fees. It was just covered in tickets. That's it. It would be lost beneath all the parking

77
00:07:48,640 --> 00:07:52,560
 tickets. If you're going to hide the plane, that's a good place to hide it. You're absolutely right.

78
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:59,120
 And it's been there since 2012. Anyway, it's a happy ending because it's now been taken out and

79
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:04,080
 it's going to be used to train engineers. Oh, great. So it's having a successful afterlife. It

80
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:08,880
 probably was wondering what's happened to it. Yeah. It wants to be up in the air like in that film.

81
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:14,880
 Okay. Here is another fact from Russell Langer and Russell says, I don't think I've heard this one

82
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:20,800
 on the podcast. Well, you haven't Russell. It is that the outer bridge crossing the southern

83
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:27,040
 musk bridge between New York, New Jersey is named after a man called Eugenius Harvey outer bridge.

84
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:37,120
 We love these, don't we? You would hear something and assume that it's an adjective and it turns out

85
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:43,520
 to be named after someone. Do we think we've got enough for a book? No. Okay. Like a till book.

86
00:08:45,520 --> 00:08:51,120
 I think we've got German chocolate cake. Yeah. French is mustard, maybe. How long are your

87
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:58,080
 bucks, Andy? How many words is there in one of your bucks? Like 80,000? We'll do a long padding

88
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:03,440
 introduction. The children's Python. We did that on a drop us a line recently. Oh, yeah.

89
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:09,680
 That's four we've got. So I'll ring the publishers and say, just hold fire. It's enough for a

90
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:18,160
 pitch. It's enough for a pitch. That's it. 1000 things you would think are called the thing for the

91
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:22,160
 clearly obvious reason, but actually they're named after a person. It's a good name. It's a good name.

92
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:28,160
 Didn't we? What was the one James that I think we almost ran on the show, which was like the

93
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:33,280
 Rolly Polly was named after someone called Michael Rolly Polly. Is it the blanket? Was it the

94
00:09:33,280 --> 00:09:39,600
 Thomas Blanket in the 30th century? So there was a person called Thomas Blanket. And I think,

95
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:43,760
 so Anna and I have argued over this for many years, when we get drunk, this is all we talk about.

96
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:49,440
 But I think that probably what happened was there was already a blanket from the French

97
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:55,680
 Blanket meaning white or from the French meaning white. And then this guy, Thomas Blanket,

98
00:09:55,680 --> 00:10:01,920
 who definitely existed, came along and popularized the name, but I don't think his name'd after him.

99
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:07,680
 God, I'm suddenly having flashbacks of like 2 a.m. in some hotel lobby drinking and you and Anna

100
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:14,240
 absolutely going for it. Hammer and Tongues, yeah. Yeah, so out of bridge, Eugenius Harvey

101
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:19,920
 out of bridge, his sister Mary Ewing out of bridge was the person who brought long tennis to America.

102
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:25,920
 That's good. So it had been taken to Bermuda from the British and then the Americans brought it,

103
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:29,920
 although in fact Mary Ewing out of bridge brought it from Bermuda to America.

104
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:35,200
 And there was, when they started doing it, everyone argued about everything about it.

105
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:41,360
 So the size of the court, the size of the net, the size of the racket, and the size of the ball

106
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:45,520
 was different wherever you played. Right. And so they had to bring it all together. And it was

107
00:10:45,520 --> 00:10:51,920
 actually Eugenius out of bridge, after whom the crossing is named, who came up with the idea

108
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:56,400
 of forming the US tennis association. Oh wow. For bringing everything together.

109
00:10:56,400 --> 00:11:02,800
 What's he called Eugenius? Eugenius. Eugenius. Yeah, so how's the spelling like Eugen and then?

110
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:08,800
 Yeah, Eugen without the E at the end and then I US. Because there must have been a moment when

111
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:15,200
 his life waited something stupid and someone got to say, you idiot Eugenius. It's like Eugenius.

112
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:23,840
 Yeah. It's like the reverse Nigel Farage. Brilliant. I got a fact that was sent in by Mimi. There

113
00:11:23,840 --> 00:11:29,920
 is an unknown animal in the Burmese zodiac. Okay. The Burmese zodiac is quite interesting. There's

114
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:36,080
 a few elements to it. One of the main things is that to know what your zodiac animal is, is based on

115
00:11:36,080 --> 00:11:41,600
 not the year that you were born, but the day of the week that you were born on. Okay. And so there

116
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:47,520
 are eight animals in this zodiac. Eight days a week. How does that work, right? They split Wednesday

117
00:11:47,520 --> 00:11:52,640
 up into two days. So you've got Wednesday morning and Wednesday evening. And the animals associated

118
00:11:52,640 --> 00:11:56,000
 with that as an elephant would tusks. And then in the evening, it's an elephant without tusks.

119
00:11:56,000 --> 00:12:02,400
 Okay. Yeah. Because eight is a very lucky number out there. An elephant who's been to the dentist.

120
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:10,320
 At 230. Yes. And so the... Sometimes I wonder why I bother.

121
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:16,960
 You've just knocked a zero off your settlement payment when I fire you after this.

122
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:25,120
 I don't mind because you're so good looking. It's fine. So anyway, there is a mysterious animal

123
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:30,800
 on there. So I looked into it. I was born on a Saturday. Andy, you were born on a Saturday. Yes.

124
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:35,040
 So we are a dragon according to it. James, you were born on a Friday. You were born on a Friday.

125
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:40,880
 So it was Anna. And you were both the mysterious animal, which is, which is a guinea pig.

126
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:48,080
 I don't know. He said it was something that didn't exist. Well, it shouldn't have existed in the area

127
00:12:48,080 --> 00:12:51,760
 when they were doing the zodiac. It's very confusing. They're not sure why it's on there. It's had

128
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:58,560
 huge debates because this is very old the zodiac. And yet, a guinea pig statue is everywhere in

129
00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:03,600
 their temples. There's guinea pigs from South America. And there was no way you could get from South

130
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:10,960
 America to Myanmar at that time. I don't suppose. Exactly. And so there is lots of questions about what it

131
00:13:10,960 --> 00:13:14,560
 is. So a lot of people have looked into it and they found similar animals that are in the area

132
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:21,120
 that it could be like the bamboo rat and so on. But, but it's known any nice animals.

133
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:27,520
 I feel bad, James, that we got dragon. You've got the bamboo rat.

134
00:13:27,520 --> 00:13:39,200
 Here's another one. Yep. This is from Edmund Galaski. And Evan writes, I came across this news tidbit

135
00:13:40,080 --> 00:13:46,400
 about a new proposal. And I recall you discussing past proposals for something similar in 2021 or 2022,

136
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:52,720
 Edmund's catching up. So Edmund, if you're listening to this in 2033, hello. But basically,

137
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:59,760
 it's about a snow tunnel. Okay. You know how you have indoor ski slopes sometimes. Oh, yeah.

138
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:04,080
 But they're a real pain in the bum because they're huge and they're very land hungry and energy

139
00:14:04,080 --> 00:14:08,720
 intensive and all of this. And it's just like it's a big pain. Well, what if you just had a massive

140
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:16,800
 hamster wheel of snow and the barrel will be spun to about 31 miles an hour. And if you're a skier,

141
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:21,040
 you can just get in and start skiing and ski the hamster wheel down, down all the time.

142
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:25,040
 You're constantly skiing down, you see? Yes. And if you're new, you can latch onto a built-in

143
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:31,680
 stability apparatus, which is like it couldn't possibly go wrong and lead you to be dragged

144
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:38,000
 around this circle upside down. It is a nice idea. It's a proposal. But the interesting thing,

145
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:43,600
 this email came in from Edmund Golaski. Golaski. Yes, skiing, isn't it?

146
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:48,720
 Right. Very common ending. Yeah. So there's literally a member of our podcast who has it.

147
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:54,400
 Oh, yeah. And she would be quite good in the hamster wheel because she's a guinea pig.

148
00:14:54,400 --> 00:14:59,920
 Beautiful. Beautiful. Right. Should we have one or two more? Yeah.

149
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:06,320
 Yeah, go on then. This one is from Paul Fuller. And Paul says the program McDonald's used to run

150
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:12,560
 their electronic menu display at their drive-throughs is called chips.exe. Very nice.

151
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:19,600
 Is that because they do chips? No. Because they do fries. They don't even know it's funny. Yeah,

152
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:26,560
 that's true. I think it's not, that's not why they use it. And also I don't think it's quite true.

153
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:33,840
 What was the corresponding name? Paul Fuller. Oh, Paul. It's hard to tell because this is like

154
00:15:33,840 --> 00:15:38,320
 corporate secrets and stuff like that. It's hard to tell exactly what's going on. But I think

155
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:43,520
 what it is is there is a payroll software called clearinghouse into bank payment system

156
00:15:43,520 --> 00:15:50,880
 or chips. And I think they put this software on a lot of their computers. And then they use

157
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:56,000
 those computers to put the electronic programs on. But the electronic programs are something else.

158
00:15:56,000 --> 00:16:01,760
 But every now and then this program fails. And then you get an error message. And it says chips.exe

159
00:16:01,760 --> 00:16:06,880
 has failed. And people see the chips.exe and they take a photo of it and put it on social media.

160
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:11,520
 And everyone goes, ah, look, that's the name of the executing program. But actually, I think it's

161
00:16:11,520 --> 00:16:18,320
 just a background program. I think that's very, that's a very thorough harkening. I love it.

162
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:22,320
 The truth is I don't know for sure. But that's what my research points to.

163
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:27,600
 Well, don't we have an in with Zoe Hamburger, friend of the podcast, who like episode one of

164
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:34,640
 little fish, senior McDonald's executive. She'll pick up a call from us. She'll pick up a call

165
00:16:34,640 --> 00:16:40,480
 from you because she'll fear that she's being fired. Absolutely. That's great research, James.

166
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:46,640
 Lovely. Don't you have one last one? Ah, yeah. This was sent into us by Ian Flower from Seattle,

167
00:16:46,640 --> 00:16:53,760
 who says this fact is from the same body of water where we employ anti espionage dolphins.

168
00:16:53,760 --> 00:17:00,400
 So you know, we spoke about these. Off the coast of Seattle. Yeah. Yeah. He's written, we've just had

169
00:17:00,400 --> 00:17:07,200
 historic flooding. And apparently the local fairies are using spy goggles to dodge dislodge debris.

170
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:12,480
 And so he heard this from a local MPR station. I had a look into it. And it seems correct. Basically,

171
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:16,480
 there are a bunch of floating logs that are going towards all of these ships. If they get hit,

172
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:20,640
 they're going to get really damaged. Okay. So the debris in the water has a different heat

173
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:26,720
 signature than the water itself. So what they do is they have a member of the team who stands

174
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:31,760
 at the front with infrared goggles on and then yells to the captain, move to the left. We've got

175
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:40,240
 a log directly in front of us. The captain's log, brilliant. Well, he'd probably say Port, I suspect

176
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:46,640
 rather than move to the left. You never know. Maybe it's his first day. Sorry, I always forget,

177
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:53,440
 is left. Port or his left starboard. It's the same number of letters left is hard. That's how you

178
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:58,400
 remember it. Oh, that's really good. I always remember all there's no port left. Like if you're having

179
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:04,000
 a decanter report. Oh, yeah. Oh, that is good. But it's confusing because you say there's no port

180
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:08,560
 left. I should say there's some port left. Dan, how do you remember the port and starboards?

181
00:18:08,560 --> 00:18:15,200
 I don't, which is why so many boats have crashed when I'm yelling out. Stop putting me on luck,

182
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:25,280
 guys. Jesus, there's a starboard. Who is it, clearly? Oh, Ryan Bingham's it. I think if you say

183
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:31,600
 there's a star on board. Yeah. And Dan thinks who's the biggest star? Ryan Bingham. What does Ryan

184
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:36,960
 Bingham's name begin with? Ah, what side is the starboard? The right. That's how you remember it.

185
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:42,480
 There we go. Yeah. As long as it's not a real emergency, we've got time to go through that every time.

186
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:49,440
 Right. Should we do some friend of the podcast? Yeah, custodian. Let's do it. Fact

187
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:57,040
 dishing out. Right. So everyone listening, if you join our Patreon, you can get a patreon.com/nosuch thing

188
00:18:57,040 --> 00:19:02,560
 as a fish. And you join, you get all sorts of stuff. You get ad free episodes. You get bonus content.

189
00:19:02,560 --> 00:19:08,000
 And if you join at the very top tier, you can become a friend of the podcast and we will dedicate one

190
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:14,240
 of our headline facts to you. So let's dish out a few of those now. I'll kick off. This is a fact

191
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:20,880
 going out to Karen McMillan, the 17th century prophet Dorothy Harling, would cure you of your sins

192
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:26,960
 by urinating on the afflicted part of your body, but would also whip you first. So a nice PG

193
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:35,280
 fact to start off. Congratulations, Karen. That's yours forever now. She was known as the perpetual spring.

194
00:19:38,560 --> 00:19:47,200
 Urinating on her followers. So congratulations, Karen. I'm a no-take-you-backsees. That's your

195
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:56,400
 fact forever now. Okay, here's the next one. Homosexuality is illegal in Sudan, but a woman can

196
00:19:56,400 --> 00:20:04,640
 have a female husband and a child can have a female father. And that fact now belongs to

197
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:10,800
 SoulTrump, S-O-L-E-T-R-A-M-P. Presumably an internet name, don't know.

198
00:20:10,800 --> 00:20:16,000
 Could be a relation of the band, SuperTrump. Could be. Yes. If you get bitten by SoulTrump,

199
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:22,560
 you turn into a SuperTrump. So I've just, I've just looked this up in the archive. And basically,

200
00:20:22,560 --> 00:20:27,200
 there's a tribe called the New Air. And if you're a woman and you can't have children,

201
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:34,320
 but you have a father who wants to pass on their property, you marry a woman who then has a child

202
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:41,520
 herself, and that child technically sort of legally becomes your child. So that is enshrined in law

203
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:46,080
 and society. And this was all about legal structures that people used to get around, sort of sex-based,

204
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:51,280
 like problems of difficulties. So we talked about the swan virgins of Albania.

205
00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:56,960
 Oh, yeah. They were women, but under the Albanian sort of sacred law, they had the status of men

206
00:20:56,960 --> 00:21:01,680
 that they lived as men. Okay. And this was a really common thing for sort of centuries. So there's

207
00:21:01,680 --> 00:21:07,600
 all that kind of stuff. Yeah. Here's a fact now for Anna Wilson. The man responsible for the first

208
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:14,480
 computer, Colossus, worked out that the way to stop crashes was to not turn it off and back on again.

209
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:20,880
 Basically, if you turned it off, you were risking damage for when you turned it back on for things

210
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:25,760
 to burn out and so on. So the best way to have it functioning was just to leave it. Turn it on and

211
00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:31,440
 just leave it. And let it let it work itself out. Yeah. I'm glad I've been doing that for years with

212
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:37,680
 my computers. That's fine. That's fine. That's fine. Should we have another one? Yeah. This one

213
00:21:37,680 --> 00:21:46,480
 goes out to Kellen with two exclamation marks. I don't think you sold it. No, sorry. I could have,

214
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:51,440
 when you said that, I could possibly hear the first exclamation mark, but I definitely couldn't

215
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:57,520
 hear too. I'm going to do it again. This one goes out to Kellen. And it's the fact that in 2014,

216
00:21:57,520 --> 00:22:04,320
 two botanists from Q Gardens checked a £1.29 packet of supermarket mushrooms and found three

217
00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:11,040
 species previously unknown to science. That's incredible. It's so good. I think it might have been

218
00:22:11,040 --> 00:22:15,760
 weight troze. Oh, well, of course. Of course. Yeah. That's the weight troze guarantee, actually.

219
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:22,640
 Isn't that weird? Because you would think those mushrooms, if you don't know what the species is,

220
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:27,600
 could conceivably be poisonous. Yeah. Quite a high proportion of mushrooms are poisonous.

221
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:33,360
 It's not the greatest food to discover new species of in a pack. Okay. I've got one more here.

222
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:41,440
 This fact is now under the custodianship of Mark Vent, who was in a recent episode and Dan said,

223
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:48,880
 I know Mark. I know Mark. Yeah. Yes. So friend of Dan Shriver, if not the entire podcast, does Mark also

224
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:54,960
 know Ash Gardner? He does. Yeah. Well, very good news for you, Mark, because Ash Gardner was the

225
00:22:54,960 --> 00:23:03,280
 originator of this fact in episode 32. And it was that in 1060 BC, the entire Egyptian city of

226
00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:10,320
 pyramasys was moved 20 kilometres north. So basically it was by the Nile and the Nile dried up,

227
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:15,360
 and they had to move the whole city. And Ash, I think, wrote a song about it. He did. And he also,

228
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:20,000
 for those who aren't familiar with his name, he wrote the theme tune for a fish as well. And that's

229
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:26,000
 why he was on the show. He also used to slip me the occasional fact. Famously, when sparkling water

230
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:31,200
 was being transported across from country to country and boats, they would take the bubbles out.

231
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:35,200
 And then reinsert the exact same bubbles back into the water when they got there. We still haven't

232
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:41,840
 checked to see if he's wrong. I think you guys assumed. Nice. Great fact. Let's do another one here.

233
00:23:41,840 --> 00:23:49,280
 This is for Kay Sutton. And the fact is, in 1864, one of Charles Dickens' friends gave him a flat

234
00:23:49,280 --> 00:23:56,560
 pack Swiss chalet as a Christmas present. Very nice. Yeah. This is now in Rochester. I've seen it.

235
00:23:56,560 --> 00:24:03,680
 I've been there a few times. It came in 58 different boxes. And he had to create this beautiful Swiss

236
00:24:03,680 --> 00:24:08,160
 chalet where he wrote a lot of novels. You've seen it so many and that, yeah. That's so cool. I want to

237
00:24:08,160 --> 00:24:14,240
 send someone else did that for him. Did the building? Yeah, probably. Yeah. But his later novels,

238
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:18,720
 I think it was his later novels, were largely written in that Swiss chalet. Well, this is one of my

239
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:23,920
 favorite facts about Charles Dickens, because Rochester is in Kent, yes, where this chalet is. And I

240
00:24:23,920 --> 00:24:28,880
 do want to go visit it, actually. But Rochester is also where there's a house, which was the inspiration

241
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:34,560
 for Miss Havisham's house in great expectations. And it's a house that was later lived in by Rod Hull.

242
00:24:34,560 --> 00:24:40,160
 It wasn't the roof that he fell off on. And that's the one he fell off. It was a Rod Hull famous

243
00:24:40,160 --> 00:24:44,960
 British entertainment who had Nimeo on his arm. He was very, very famous in the what, 70s and 80s.

244
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:49,520
 He went up onto the roof to fix the TV aerial. Yeah, he wanted to watch football match.

245
00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:53,120
 Apparently, because Giles Brandress told him. Don't think that's true. Okay.

246
00:24:56,400 --> 00:25:00,480
 I've heard a couple of different entertainers saying that they told him that. Could have been

247
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:04,320
 Bruce, he could have been woken, but someone, someone foolish told Rod Hull to go up and fix the

248
00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:09,120
 TV aerial on his roof. And he fell off and died. Yeah. Miss Havisham's house. I can't believe it's

249
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:13,840
 Miss Havisham's house. I know. I didn't know that. That should be a little footnote in all future

250
00:25:13,840 --> 00:25:20,240
 editions of the great expectations. Just as you're reading. By the way,

251
00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:29,120
 I wonder who lives there now. Yeah. I'd love to live there. That's such a historical house.

252
00:25:29,120 --> 00:25:33,840
 Timmy Mallet lives there now. Does he? Yeah, he does. The guy who invented the mallet.

253
00:25:33,840 --> 00:25:39,200
 Sorry to all the international listeners. Let's have another fact.

254
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:46,480
 This one goes out to Johanna Kuivunin. I hope I pronounced your name right. And it's that

255
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:51,520
 neuroscientists can tell if you're a musician simply by looking at your brain.

256
00:25:52,320 --> 00:25:56,960
 And I imagine this is the brain activity rather than opening up your skull and having a look at the

257
00:25:56,960 --> 00:26:04,800
 tissue. And this is all about neuroscience and how musicians brainwaves synchronize when they

258
00:26:04,800 --> 00:26:10,480
 have a duet together and all sorts of stuff. And turns out it's in the brain. The music.

259
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:19,200
 Do you think our brain synchronized when we're doing this show? 100%. I do. Yeah. What about when I'm

260
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:23,200
 saying an anecdote and you're just completely glazing over and not paying attention? And I'm doing

261
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:28,880
 my emails on my phone. Yeah. I have to be in sync because I know when the anecdote ends. So

262
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:37,040
 we're apart but together. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Where did they say that that does happen

263
00:26:37,040 --> 00:26:42,000
 with heartbeats, with strangers? Is it during watching a movie? What's the cinema? Yeah. Like you

264
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:47,120
 blink and sink. That might be a fact that comes up later. Yeah. Yeah. So I can I can actually believe

265
00:26:47,120 --> 00:26:55,360
 that our most intimate rhythms would be united during a show recording. Yeah. Yeah. Okay.

266
00:26:55,360 --> 00:27:07,280
 Exciting. I haven't had a period since I'm a left. Too much? No. I don't think so. I'm sure you

267
00:27:07,280 --> 00:27:13,040
 should have not pregnant though. Okay. Here's another one. This one is for Richard M.

268
00:27:13,760 --> 00:27:20,080
 During the Second World War Jack Warner of Warner Brothers realized his studios were indistinguishable

269
00:27:20,080 --> 00:27:25,920
 from a nearby aircraft factory. So painted a huge sign on the roof saying Lockheed that way.

270
00:27:25,920 --> 00:27:29,680
 That's very funny. Yeah. That's very good. Yeah. That's I love I love

271
00:27:29,680 --> 00:27:36,720
 anyone who paints on the top of a roof because it's often used. I just love those guys

272
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:47,840
 unless it's Rudolf. You love people who paint on the top of buildings. I love walks in the countryside,

273
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:55,280
 champagne and people who paint on the top of buildings. When is your when is your book coming out, Dad,

274
00:27:55,280 --> 00:28:00,240

00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:07,200
 on people whose names are what the thing is hitting the shots. I'll see you with the charts.

276
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:15,840
 I remember there's one where someone had painted on the top of a roof as people were landing into

277
00:28:15,840 --> 00:28:20,880
 LA. Welcome to San Francisco. You know, things like that. Yeah. That's fun. You know, it's fun. Yeah.

278
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:24,800
 You know, it's great. Yeah. Absolutely. Yeah. Yeah. The guy from Warner Brothers, he could have

279
00:28:24,800 --> 00:28:29,280
 painted a fake tunnel on the side and there'd be a cliff or something.
