1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,580
 (upbeat music)

2
00:00:02,580 --> 00:00:08,880
 - Hey, Clubfish members.

3
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:11,840
 Welcome to your bonus compilation episode of Fish.

4
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:13,020
 This is Biggie.

5
00:00:13,020 --> 00:00:14,880
 This week we got 40 plus minutes

6
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:17,040
 and it has everything from, oh, I don't know,

7
00:00:17,040 --> 00:00:20,120
 weird lullabies to the evils of TV,

8
00:00:20,120 --> 00:00:23,600
 there's books on dogs, Captain Hook's Time at Eaton,

9
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:25,200
 and there's Weird Yellow Blood,

10
00:00:25,200 --> 00:00:26,840
 Neighborly Psychic Readings.

11
00:00:26,840 --> 00:00:30,280
 It's got a ton, and a lot on Ethel Smythe.

12
00:00:30,280 --> 00:00:31,320
 You remember Ethel Smythe?

13
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:34,120
 She's the brilliant conductor-composer.

14
00:00:34,120 --> 00:00:36,680
 She features heavily in this week's episode.

15
00:00:36,680 --> 00:00:39,120
 So enjoy all the bits that didn't make it

16
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:41,920
 into the main show, and I'll see you on the other side.

17
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:47,120
 - Emilyne Pankhurst had practised her stone throwing

18
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:49,200
 in Ethel Smythe's garden.

19
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:50,160
 - Had she? - Yeah.

20
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:52,160
 - Supposedly, close by on Hook Heath,

21
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:53,680
 which was just outside her house.

22
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:54,520
 - Okay, yeah.

23
00:00:54,520 --> 00:00:56,040
 - Next to the golf course, by the way.

24
00:00:56,040 --> 00:00:56,880
 - Ooh.

25
00:00:56,880 --> 00:00:57,700
 - In case you're wondering.

26
00:00:57,700 --> 00:01:00,040
 - Are you going for power, or are you going for precision?

27
00:01:00,040 --> 00:01:02,360
 - I think a bit of both, if you're trying to smash a window.

28
00:01:02,360 --> 00:01:03,200
 - Yeah.

29
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:04,200
 - At no point throwing it really hard,

30
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:05,960
 nowhere near the window, but equally,

31
00:01:05,960 --> 00:01:08,480
 there's no point throwing it really softly at the window.

32
00:01:08,480 --> 00:01:09,320
 - You're right.

33
00:01:09,320 --> 00:01:10,880
 - Golfy, you really do have to nail the two, don't you?

34
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:11,720
 - That's throwing.

35
00:01:11,720 --> 00:01:12,560
 - It's a lot of practise.

36
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:13,400
 - Yeah, it's throwing.

37
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:14,220
 - It didn't pay off.

38
00:01:14,220 --> 00:01:15,760
 Mrs. Pankhurst must have muffed up the shot

39
00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:16,600
 at 10 Downing Street.

40
00:01:16,600 --> 00:01:17,440
 - Oh, no.

41
00:01:17,440 --> 00:01:18,280
 - Yeah, very sad.

42
00:01:18,280 --> 00:01:19,800
 - Where'd it go?

43
00:01:19,800 --> 00:01:20,640
 - 11 Downing Street.

44
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:21,480
 - Is it still there?

45
00:01:21,480 --> 00:01:22,320
 Are you wondering?

46
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:24,600
 - No, churches aren't cross-shaped, are they?

47
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:25,440
 - Usually, yeah.

48
00:01:25,440 --> 00:01:26,280
 - Really?

49
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:27,120
 - Yeah.

50
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:27,960
 - What, the layout, the ground layout was a cross?

51
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:28,800
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

52
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:30,160
 - You see, you know that you get the main doors at the back,

53
00:01:30,160 --> 00:01:32,880
 and you go all the way up to the front with the altar,

54
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:34,240
 and there's the head bit,

55
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:35,920
 and then you've got the two arms across.

56
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:39,320
 - Never noticed, never had an aerial view of why my church.

57
00:01:39,320 --> 00:01:40,160
 - You can see them from above.

58
00:01:40,160 --> 00:01:41,160
 - The nave and the tranceps.

59
00:01:41,160 --> 00:01:42,000
 - Yeah.

60
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:42,840
 - Wow.

61
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:45,160
 - And some churches have, you know, the head,

62
00:01:45,160 --> 00:01:47,280
 'cause it represents the cross that Christ on the cross,

63
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:48,120
 by the blood.

64
00:01:48,120 --> 00:01:48,960
 - I made that connection.

65
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:49,800
 - Yeah.

66
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:50,760
 (laughing)

67
00:01:50,760 --> 00:01:53,280
 - Like knots and crosses, you see.

68
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:54,920
 (laughing)

69
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:58,080
 - The top bit is called the chancel, I think,

70
00:01:58,080 --> 00:02:01,880
 and some churches, they're not in a completely straight cross.

71
00:02:01,880 --> 00:02:03,280
 They've got the chancel, the head bit,

72
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:04,680
 is tilted to one side,

73
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:07,600
 and that represents the drooping head of Christ on the cross.

74
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:08,960
 It's called a nodding chancel.

75
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:09,800
 That's what it's called.

76
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:11,280
 - I do not know that.

77
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:14,680
 It's Christ being a bit hungry, getting a bit sad.

78
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:16,320
 - A bit dying, I think.

79
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:19,480
 - Yeah, I think it's not a snacky thing, it's a...

80
00:02:19,480 --> 00:02:22,120
 - Oh, can someone get me a snack?

81
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:23,760
 - I'm feeling so hangry.

82
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:26,240
 (laughing)

83
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:28,520
 - Do you remember on this show, I'm sure I said this,

84
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:30,680
 that I once went to an art gallery,

85
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:33,760
 and there was, I thought someone had collapsed on the floor,

86
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:35,960
 and I went and told the people and said,

87
00:02:35,960 --> 00:02:36,840
 "Oh, someone's collapsed,"

88
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:38,920
 and it turned out to be an artwork, and it was a doll.

89
00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:39,760
 - Yeah, yeah.

90
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:41,720
 - I think, very recently, I read in the news

91
00:02:41,720 --> 00:02:44,000
 that that happened again.

92
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,480
 But this actually got in the news,

93
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:48,040
 because the person saw the doll on the floor,

94
00:02:48,040 --> 00:02:50,840
 and called 999, and said that someone's collapsed

95
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:52,160
 in the art gallery.

96
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:54,120
 And then only when the ambulance came,

97
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:56,880
 they realized that it was a doll.

98
00:02:56,880 --> 00:02:59,040
 - It's dangerous, 'cause is this a cry wolf situation,

99
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:01,120
 where we're all gonna stop reporting crimes,

100
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:03,120
 calling ambulances, trying to resuscitate people,

101
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:04,560
 'cause we'll assume everything.

102
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:05,920
 - Everything is an art, isn't it?

103
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:08,080
 - Someone's broken into my house.

104
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:10,180
 I don't think you need to send anyone round.

105
00:03:10,180 --> 00:03:12,240
 (laughing)

106
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:13,480
 - It's so hard to know.

107
00:03:13,480 --> 00:03:15,400
 - They look like Tracy M in this.

108
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:16,360
 - I feel very moved.

109
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:19,720
 So I think actually on balance, it's fine.

110
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:20,880
 - I wonder if in early days,

111
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:22,880
 if people hadn't ever gone to an art gallery before,

112
00:03:22,880 --> 00:03:24,480
 they would see like the Mona Lisa and be like,

113
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:28,880
 "Someone help her, she's stuck in a frame, in a wall."

114
00:03:28,880 --> 00:03:31,160
 (laughing)

115
00:03:31,160 --> 00:03:32,000
 - Yeah.

116
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:35,200
 Have you guys heard of the interesting medieval job?

117
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:36,560
 The Moss Reeve.

118
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:37,520
 - Oh, Jesus.

119
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:38,720
 (laughing)

120
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:43,480
 I remember reading the Moss Reeves tale by Chaucer.

121
00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:45,000
 - And this is someone who adjudicated,

122
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,440
 who was allowed to dig up Pete from Moslands.

123
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:48,280
 - Is that right?

124
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:49,880
 - Yeah, 'cause you can't just have it free

125
00:03:49,880 --> 00:03:50,920
 for a lot of the Moslands.

126
00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:55,360
 - So if I wanted to, if I wanted some Pete,

127
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:58,880
 would I go there and then the Moss Wrangler would say,

128
00:03:58,880 --> 00:04:00,960
 "You're allowed this area or you're not allowed to,"

129
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:02,960
 or whatever, or Moss Reeve.

130
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:04,440
 Come on, not a Moss Wrangler.

131
00:04:04,440 --> 00:04:06,520
 That's very low in the hierarchy.

132
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:07,880
 - Could you believe I'd already forgotten

133
00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:09,520
 what the word was at that stage?

134
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:10,960
 - But here's the weird thing.

135
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:13,040
 The two stars of the film, "The Matrix,"

136
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:16,120
 are Keanu Reeves and Karrion Moss.

137
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:16,960
 - That is amazing.

138
00:04:16,960 --> 00:04:17,800
 - Wow.

139
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:19,920
 - Does that prove that we are living, in fact,

140
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:24,400
 in a matrix designed by a Moss enthusiast?

141
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:25,240
 - Yeah.

142
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:28,440
 - She, you know, in her time,

143
00:04:28,440 --> 00:04:31,640
 she was obviously held back, to a certain extent,

144
00:04:31,640 --> 00:04:32,840
 as a woman composer.

145
00:04:32,840 --> 00:04:33,800
 She didn't get, you know,

146
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:35,200
 when people were describing her music,

147
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:36,680
 they would always give her criticisms.

148
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:37,560
 You would never give a mail.

149
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:39,080
 So, you know, it sounds too feminine

150
00:04:39,080 --> 00:04:40,760
 or she's trying to sound too masculine

151
00:04:40,760 --> 00:04:42,880
 or, you know, they would always bring her, you know,

152
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:43,720
 sex into it.

153
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:47,600
 So, it's quite nice that in 2018, she won a Grammy.

154
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:48,440
 - Yeah.

155
00:04:48,440 --> 00:04:49,280
 - Wow.

156
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:50,320
 - Yeah, she won a Grammy. - So cool.

157
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:53,640
 - And it was for an opera that she wrote in 1930,

158
00:04:53,640 --> 00:04:54,560
 called "The Prison."

159
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:58,120
 So, it was big news for old Ethel.

160
00:04:58,120 --> 00:04:59,280
 - It's quite nice for her,

161
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:01,480
 'cause she said that the thing she was most afraid about

162
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:03,040
 when she died was that she'd be forgotten.

163
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:05,000
 Her music would be forgotten, sorry.

164
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,640
 So, she was afraid of her music dying with her.

165
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:09,880
 And it did, it died dead flat on its back

166
00:05:09,880 --> 00:05:10,800
 for like 50 years.

167
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:12,720
 And now, there's this real revival.

168
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:15,040
 She opened "Gleinborn" in 2020.

169
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:18,160
 It's like the biggest opera festival in the UK, really.

170
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:19,680
 She's played at the proms.

171
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:22,240
 So, she is finally coming back.

172
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:24,960
 But, yeah, they sound really interesting, her operas.

173
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:26,960
 - Yeah, she's got cool song titles as well.

174
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:28,320
 I mean, most of them are quite normal,

175
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:29,600
 but there's one I came across

176
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:31,720
 called "Variations on an Original Theme,

177
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:34,600
 Brackets of an Exceedingly Dismal'd Nature."

178
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:36,640
 Close brackets in D-flat major.

179
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:38,880
 - Nice. - Nice little, yeah.

180
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:39,720
 - That's cool.

181
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:41,800
 - Actually, on "Deafness and Conductors,"

182
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:43,000
 there was a thing of Beethoven

183
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,680
 where he used to insist on conducting his own pieces

184
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:47,160
 even after he went deaf.

185
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:49,480
 And so, at the premiere of his ninth symphony,

186
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:51,920
 he said, "I have to conduct this.

187
00:05:51,920 --> 00:05:54,080
 You know, it's my pièce de résistance."

188
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:56,480
 And there was another conductor, Michael Umlauf,

189
00:05:56,480 --> 00:05:57,800
 who was on the sidelines,

190
00:05:57,800 --> 00:05:59,800
 who secretly told the orchestra, "Look at me.

191
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:01,120
 Don't look at him." - Oh, really?

192
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:01,960
 - Yeah.

193
00:06:01,960 --> 00:06:02,800
 And when the piece came to an end,

194
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:04,160
 Beethoven didn't know it had finished,

195
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:05,600
 and he kept on conducting.

196
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:07,360
 And one of the musicians had to get up

197
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:08,200
 and sort of nudge him.

198
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:10,520
 - I remember seeing a movie where that was a scene

199
00:06:10,520 --> 00:06:12,720
 where he just continues on, and they've all stopped,

200
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:15,400
 and he just, he's so into it, and he's waving about.

201
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:16,240
 - I remember that.

202
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:17,320
 There's a massive dog in it, wasn't there?

203
00:06:17,320 --> 00:06:19,600
 - Yes, that's right, yeah.

204
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:21,680
 There's a Kenyan lullaby which has hyenas in it.

205
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:23,360
 - Yeah. - And it goes,

206
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:25,280
 "Well, I'll just say it.

207
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:26,920
 Rock, rock, rock.

208
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:29,560
 The baby who cries will be eaten by a hyena."

209
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:30,640
 (laughing)

210
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:31,480
 - No.

211
00:06:31,480 --> 00:06:33,360
 (laughing)

212
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:34,200
 - Yeah.

213
00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:36,000
 And I only mentioned that, in particular,

214
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,920
 because we talked about that.

215
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:40,760
 Napoleon Bonaparte one, a few weeks ago now,

216
00:06:40,760 --> 00:06:42,880
 and it was he'll eat you, eat you.

217
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:44,000
 - He'll eat your bones or something.

218
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,360
 - Yeah, every, snap, snap, snap, yeah, yeah.

219
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:49,200
 And I only mentioned that because we got an email

220
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:50,360
 off the back of that, you know,

221
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:54,040
 this Bonaparte era nursery rhyme, from a bloke,

222
00:06:54,040 --> 00:06:55,440
 and I didn't write his name down, I'm afraid,

223
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:58,120
 but he wrote in saying,

224
00:06:58,120 --> 00:07:02,080
 "I have sung that lullaby to my own daughters

225
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:05,320
 about Bonaparte, except in his yard,

226
00:07:05,320 --> 00:07:07,200
 it goes even further back than Bonaparte,

227
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:09,840
 and it was originally about Oliver Cromwell, this rhyme.

228
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:10,680
 - Wow.

229
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:11,520
 - Oliver Cromwell was the bogeyman.

230
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:13,920
 So there are a couple of children,

231
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:16,120
 adults now, I believe, in Britain today,

232
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:19,480
 who grew up with Cromwell era threats.

233
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:20,320
 - So good.

234
00:07:20,320 --> 00:07:21,160
 - Yeah.

235
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:22,360
 - With royalist parents, I assume.

236
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:23,200
 (laughing)

237
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:24,280
 - Yeah, you can say, yeah, yeah.

238
00:07:24,280 --> 00:07:26,800
 - Napoleon Bonaparte's better, he'll eat your Bonaparte.

239
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:27,640
 - I know, it's great.

240
00:07:27,640 --> 00:07:29,520
 Never thought of this name like that.

241
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:32,680
 - Or your Bonaparte, yeah, even scarier.

242
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:33,520
 - Yeah.

243
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:35,560
 - If you search who invented the ejector seat,

244
00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:39,480
 then you usually find someone called Everard Calthrop,

245
00:07:39,480 --> 00:07:42,360
 who seems to have had a patent in 1916,

246
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:45,240
 and he was friends with Charles Rolls of Rolls Royce fame,

247
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:47,800
 and Charles Rolls died in a biplane crash,

248
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:49,560
 and he thought, well, I'm gonna invent

249
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:51,320
 something that would have saved him.

250
00:07:51,320 --> 00:07:54,800
 Interesting thing about him is he also invented

251
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:59,560
 the first modern parachute, and he patented that,

252
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:02,360
 and he offered it to the British Air Force,

253
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:03,720
 and the British Air Force decided

254
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:05,840
 they didn't want parachutes in their planes

255
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:07,560
 because they said it might impair

256
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:10,000
 the fighting spirit of pilots.

257
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:14,800
 So basically, if your pilots had a way to escape,

258
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:17,000
 they might not fight hard enough.

259
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,040
 - I can understand that, if I were a pilot,

260
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:20,960
 I'd pretty much 10 seconds after taking off,

261
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:21,800
 I'd be out of there.

262
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:23,320
 - It's astonishing though, isn't it?

263
00:08:23,320 --> 00:08:25,360
 And this was in World War I,

264
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:28,560
 and the British refused to let any of their pilots,

265
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:30,120
 all the pilots wanted them,

266
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:32,600
 the British refused to let their pilots have parachutes,

267
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:34,320
 all the other countries had them,

268
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:36,080
 because this guy, Cal Throp,

269
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:37,960
 he thought, what the fuck is going on?

270
00:08:37,960 --> 00:08:39,680
 So he published his parachute,

271
00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:40,800
 he put it in the newspaper, he said,

272
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:42,640
 look, this thing, it's amazing.

273
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:43,960
 Everyone needs to have it.

274
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:46,520
 The British said, no, our guys are not having it,

275
00:08:46,520 --> 00:08:47,840
 and every other country in the world said,

276
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:49,120
 well, of course we're gonna have it.

277
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:50,880
 - And who ended up winning that war, James?

278
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:55,880
 Good old British and allied Italian as well,

279
00:08:55,880 --> 00:08:59,360
 yeah, various teams of French.

280
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:00,680
 - It's so amazing, isn't it?

281
00:09:00,680 --> 00:09:02,080
 - But they would just do that.

282
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:03,240
 - Yeah, that's incredible.

283
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:04,520
 - So speaking of Dickens,

284
00:09:04,520 --> 00:09:07,640
 in the Tale of Two Cities, he writes,

285
00:09:07,640 --> 00:09:09,760
 "There was a king with a large jaw

286
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:13,400
 "and a queen with a plain face on the throne of England."

287
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:15,960
 And he's talking about Queen Charlotte there.

288
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:16,800
 - Rude.

289
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:20,240
 - Yeah, she's written about a lot at the time

290
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:21,960
 as having a plain face.

291
00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:24,840
 But she was a patron of the arts,

292
00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:28,120
 she commissioned Mozart maybe for some stuff.

293
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:29,600
 - Yeah, that's right, yeah.

294
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:32,600
 - And there is a theory, which I must say

295
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:35,240
 is not agreed by all historians,

296
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:38,080
 that she might have had some African heritage

297
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:42,200
 and might have been the first not completely white

298
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:44,640
 member of the English royal family.

299
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:48,000
 The idea is that the Portuguese side of her family

300
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,600
 might have been related to someone called

301
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:53,440
 Margarita de Castro, a Susa who was Moorish.

302
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:55,480
 And the idea was that she might have had

303
00:09:55,480 --> 00:09:58,320
 some black heritage, but like I say,

304
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:00,040
 not all historians do agree with that.

305
00:10:00,040 --> 00:10:02,240
 - Yeah, she had 15 kids.

306
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:03,560
 - 15, yeah. - 15, yeah.

307
00:10:03,560 --> 00:10:04,400
 - That's a lot.

308
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:05,240
 - That's a lot.

309
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:06,080
 - Do they all make it?

310
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:06,920
 No, they can't have fucking things.

311
00:10:06,920 --> 00:10:08,560
 - 13 made it past childhood.

312
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:11,040
 So yeah, she lost two sadly quite early.

313
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:12,840
 But 13, yeah.

314
00:10:12,840 --> 00:10:14,920
 - That's an unbelievable strike rate for those days.

315
00:10:14,920 --> 00:10:15,880
 Well done. - Yeah.

316
00:10:15,880 --> 00:10:17,760
 - Taking flights must have been tougher.

317
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:18,600
 - Oh my god.

318
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:19,920
 (all laughing)

319
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:21,160
 Australia, no way.

320
00:10:21,160 --> 00:10:24,480
 - What kind of pram do you get?

321
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:25,720
 Do you have to get one of those prams

322
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:27,520
 with like 15 seats side by side?

323
00:10:27,520 --> 00:10:28,360
 - Oh yeah.

324
00:10:28,360 --> 00:10:30,080
 - I feel like they do especially make

325
00:10:30,080 --> 00:10:33,000
 those really long prams just for them.

326
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,760
 Maybe I'm wrong, but I feel like I've seen them as like.

327
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:36,600
 - I see them.

328
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:37,960
 The ones I see, 'cause there's a nanny

329
00:10:37,960 --> 00:10:40,160
 who works across the road from where we live

330
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:41,080
 and she looks after kids.

331
00:10:41,080 --> 00:10:42,160
 She always acquires a new kid.

332
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:43,000
 And whenever she does this,

333
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,520
 kind of just like a new feature on the pram.

334
00:10:44,520 --> 00:10:46,600
 It just gets higher and higher.

335
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:47,800
 It's like babies sitting.

336
00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:49,720
 Yeah, it's just, it looks like a transformer

337
00:10:49,720 --> 00:10:50,760
 that's just got stuck.

338
00:10:50,760 --> 00:10:52,160
 - Is she building this herself?

339
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:53,000
 - It feels like it.

340
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,920
 But no, I think it's just sort of like extra extensions

341
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:56,760
 to each bit of the pram.

342
00:10:56,760 --> 00:10:57,880
 - That's very cool.

343
00:10:57,880 --> 00:10:59,440
 - There's a big movement these days, obviously,

344
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:01,000
 for trying to stop people

345
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,200
 from smoking almost altogether.

346
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:04,520
 New Zealand, for example,

347
00:11:04,520 --> 00:11:06,640
 if you were born in 2009,

348
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:08,240
 you were no longer allowed to buy cigarettes.

349
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:12,640
 It is extinct to anyone who is 2009 born and onwards.

350
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:14,280
 - How old are they now, 14?

351
00:11:14,280 --> 00:11:17,440
 - Yeah, so, shouldn't be smoking at that age anyway.

352
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:18,280
 - No, exactly.

353
00:11:18,280 --> 00:11:19,240
 - It is amazing though, isn't it?

354
00:11:19,240 --> 00:11:21,400
 That like, for us, it was always like

355
00:11:21,400 --> 00:11:24,360
 you had to look older to get cigarettes.

356
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:26,920
 But for them, when they'll have to look younger,

357
00:11:26,920 --> 00:11:27,920
 when they're 30 years old,

358
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:30,160
 they'll be like, are you 30 or 40?

359
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:31,640
 And if you're 30...

360
00:11:31,640 --> 00:11:32,840
 - They will have to look older still.

361
00:11:32,840 --> 00:11:33,680
 - Oh yeah.

362
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:35,520
 - They won't, no one will be going into shops like,

363
00:11:35,520 --> 00:11:36,680
 I'm five, I promise.

364
00:11:36,680 --> 00:11:38,840
 (laughing)

365
00:11:38,840 --> 00:11:40,360
 - But they have to keep looking older.

366
00:11:40,360 --> 00:11:41,680
 It's not like they can breathe a sigh of relief

367
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:43,320
 when they hit sort of 20 and thing.

368
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:46,440
 It's even at 50, they'll try to look 60.

369
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:47,440
 Oh my God, what a pain.

370
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:48,280
 - Yeah, you're gonna want to look older.

371
00:11:48,280 --> 00:11:50,360
 - Oh God, yeah, load of 50 or what.

372
00:11:50,360 --> 00:11:52,680
 And around, like they've got fake bus passes

373
00:11:52,680 --> 00:11:54,040
 and all of this and that.

374
00:11:54,040 --> 00:11:55,240
 - Yeah.

375
00:11:55,240 --> 00:11:56,880
 - Didn't put my foundation on today.

376
00:11:56,880 --> 00:11:58,480
 (laughing)

377
00:11:58,480 --> 00:11:59,880
 - I have a question for the three of you.

378
00:11:59,880 --> 00:12:00,720
 - Oh yeah.

379
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:03,360
 - Have you ever watched something,

380
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:05,960
 a series, for example, in a, like,

381
00:12:05,960 --> 00:12:08,920
 you've watched ahead without your partner knowing about it,

382
00:12:08,920 --> 00:12:10,400
 despite the fact you're meant to be watching it together?

383
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:11,240
 - Yes.

384
00:12:11,240 --> 00:12:12,080
 - No.

385
00:12:12,080 --> 00:12:13,280
 - Okay, two yeses, one no.

386
00:12:13,280 --> 00:12:15,920
 There was a device developed in 2022

387
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:17,520
 that was supposedly gonna deal with this thing.

388
00:12:17,520 --> 00:12:18,360
 - Oh yeah.

389
00:12:18,360 --> 00:12:19,180
 - This is a slightly weird thing.

390
00:12:19,180 --> 00:12:20,020
 It's a slightly PR thing.

391
00:12:20,020 --> 00:12:21,080
 - Is it called a divorce?

392
00:12:21,080 --> 00:12:22,640
 (laughing)

393
00:12:22,640 --> 00:12:24,200
 - So they claimed they'd done a survey

394
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:26,120
 and that all of the people who had cheated

395
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:29,160
 on their partners in television terms,

396
00:12:29,160 --> 00:12:30,640
 12% would-

397
00:12:30,640 --> 00:12:31,840
 - I was just glancing.

398
00:12:31,840 --> 00:12:34,280
 (laughing)

399
00:12:34,280 --> 00:12:37,000
 - 12% would re-watch later on with their partner

400
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,000
 and just not admit.

401
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,080
 I just sort of like go along.

402
00:12:39,080 --> 00:12:39,920
 Oh my God.

403
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:40,760
 - That's what I do.

404
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:43,000
 - So anyway, last year,

405
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,360
 all right, I don't know why it was them who did it.

406
00:12:44,360 --> 00:12:48,160
 Cornetto, yes, that Cornetto, there's anyone Cornetto.

407
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:49,840
 They claimed they had invented this device,

408
00:12:49,840 --> 00:12:52,000
 these rings that partners would wear

409
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,240
 and that would then make you unable to watch on

410
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:56,440
 in the series without your partner, if you saw what I mean.

411
00:12:56,440 --> 00:12:58,600
 So you have to be together with your partner,

412
00:12:58,600 --> 00:13:00,520
 both wearing your special Cornetto rings.

413
00:13:00,520 --> 00:13:02,560
 - But they obviously hadn't invented that, have they?

414
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:03,880
 'Cause that's not the business they're in

415
00:13:03,880 --> 00:13:05,360
 and why would they do it if it were?

416
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:07,000
 - I watched a very slick PR video,

417
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,320
 which was certainly claimed to have made,

418
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:10,780
 not released on April the 1st, I did check.

419
00:13:10,780 --> 00:13:12,720
 - Does anyone else feel like an ice cream?

420
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:13,640
 I don't know why.

421
00:13:13,640 --> 00:13:15,080
 (laughing)

422
00:13:15,080 --> 00:13:17,800
 - So why did they, have you dug into

423
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:19,040
 whether they've gotten any trouble

424
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:20,640
 with the advertising standards agency

425
00:13:20,640 --> 00:13:22,080
 for making these wild claims?

426
00:13:22,080 --> 00:13:23,160
 - I haven't, I...

427
00:13:23,160 --> 00:13:25,160
 - Well, okay, someone dig into that please.

428
00:13:25,160 --> 00:13:26,720
 (laughing)

429
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:30,400
 Actually, on TV based hoaxes,

430
00:13:30,400 --> 00:13:33,080
 in 1962 there was a hoax in Sweden

431
00:13:33,080 --> 00:13:36,120
 that tens of thousands of Swedish people fell for

432
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:38,240
 and Swedish people today still remember

433
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:39,800
 their parents doing this.

434
00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:41,800
 And this was the era of color TV

435
00:13:41,800 --> 00:13:43,240
 coming to various different countries.

436
00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:45,280
 Sweden didn't have color TV yet,

437
00:13:45,280 --> 00:13:48,000
 didn't get it until 1970, I don't think.

438
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:51,000
 But in 1962, Sweden had one TV channel

439
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:54,760
 and the only TV channel broadcasts an information video

440
00:13:54,760 --> 00:13:58,320
 presenting a technical expert called Kjell Stenson,

441
00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:01,120
 who said, "You can actually make your television broadcast

442
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:05,520
 in color by stretching nylon stockings over the screen."

443
00:14:05,520 --> 00:14:08,760
 And it bends, 'cause it bends the wavelengths of light

444
00:14:08,760 --> 00:14:10,480
 in certain ways, which then reflect

445
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:13,640
 what the original colors were going to be on the screen.

446
00:14:13,640 --> 00:14:14,480
 - That's very clever.

447
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:16,920
 - So it is really very clever.

448
00:14:16,920 --> 00:14:19,080
 And thousands and thousands of people tried to do this

449
00:14:19,080 --> 00:14:20,640
 and people still remember their parents

450
00:14:20,640 --> 00:14:22,080
 were getting these nylon stockings

451
00:14:22,080 --> 00:14:24,560
 just ruining them, stretching them over the TV.

452
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:26,120
 - That's so funny, that's a great,

453
00:14:26,120 --> 00:14:28,600
 it's a great April though, 'cause it's kind of,

454
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:30,440
 it's certainly believable enough to me.

455
00:14:30,440 --> 00:14:33,480
 - It's low stakes, the worst is someone's going to

456
00:14:33,480 --> 00:14:35,480
 spoil a few pairs of ties.

457
00:14:35,480 --> 00:14:36,960
 - Your wife's pissed off when she comes,

458
00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:38,680
 she's got one pair of nylon stockings,

459
00:14:38,680 --> 00:14:40,400
 she was saving them for the ball.

460
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:43,560
 - I always thought that John Logie Baird

461
00:14:43,560 --> 00:14:45,560
 was the inventor of the TV and there's probably

462
00:14:45,560 --> 00:14:47,840
 a lot of controversy about who the true inventor is,

463
00:14:47,840 --> 00:14:49,880
 but one person who does have a big claim to it

464
00:14:49,880 --> 00:14:52,240
 is a guy who was called Philo Farnsworth.

465
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:56,400
 And he supposedly, according to the story, invented it.

466
00:14:56,400 --> 00:14:58,160
 He was like a farmer boy and he invented it

467
00:14:58,160 --> 00:14:59,840
 when he was 14 years old.

468
00:14:59,840 --> 00:15:01,400
 - Television. - What?

469
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:02,240
 - On a farm.

470
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:05,320
 He was a teenager, he invented it,

471
00:15:05,320 --> 00:15:07,760
 and then it got taken over with other people's inventions.

472
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:09,160
 It became very bitter about it.

473
00:15:09,160 --> 00:15:10,360
 He had a few successes with it,

474
00:15:10,360 --> 00:15:13,000
 but like Silicon Valley people these days

475
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,600
 who don't let their kids go and use computers

476
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:17,360
 and stuff like that, he was exactly the same.

477
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:19,720
 He didn't want his kids watching TV

478
00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:22,120
 'cause he just thought it was a terrible cursed item

479
00:15:22,120 --> 00:15:25,280
 that ruined you of any intellect or anything like that.

480
00:15:25,280 --> 00:15:27,640
 So his children have said things that you know,

481
00:15:27,640 --> 00:15:29,960
 he said there's nothing on it that's worthwhile

482
00:15:29,960 --> 00:15:31,360
 and we're not gonna watch it in this household,

483
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:34,320
 I don't want you on as part of your intellectual diet.

484
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:38,040
 And so he hated his invention throughout his whole life.

485
00:15:38,040 --> 00:15:40,440
 - He thought it was gonna like save the world

486
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:42,600
 and stop all wars and stuff.

487
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:44,960
 His idea was that it would be a place

488
00:15:44,960 --> 00:15:46,280
 where people could learn things

489
00:15:46,280 --> 00:15:47,800
 and learn things about different countries

490
00:15:47,800 --> 00:15:49,160
 and learn things about the world

491
00:15:49,160 --> 00:15:50,880
 and people would be so educated

492
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:52,560
 they wouldn't want to have wars anymore.

493
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:53,400
 - Right.

494
00:15:53,400 --> 00:15:54,840
 - At least he was disproven quickly, right?

495
00:15:54,840 --> 00:15:57,720
 'Cause presumably this was 1920s, 30s time.

496
00:15:57,720 --> 00:15:59,640
 So, you know, he didn't have to wait 50 years

497
00:15:59,640 --> 00:16:00,720
 before the next big war.

498
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:01,560
 - No, yeah.

499
00:16:01,560 --> 00:16:03,960
 But he did, so he did hate it and hate it and hate it.

500
00:16:03,960 --> 00:16:06,040
 And then he turned around,

501
00:16:06,040 --> 00:16:08,720
 just a miracle day changed his mind.

502
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:09,560
 - I can guess.

503
00:16:09,560 --> 00:16:10,400
 - Yeah.

504
00:16:10,400 --> 00:16:12,280
 - It's the first episode of Breaking Bad.

505
00:16:12,280 --> 00:16:14,400
 (laughing)

506
00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:15,240
 - No, it was the--

507
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:16,080
 - I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

508
00:16:16,080 --> 00:16:17,840
 - It was the vertical TV.

509
00:16:17,840 --> 00:16:19,920
 He thought, no, it's not the vertical TV.

510
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:21,160
 - So what was the day?

511
00:16:21,160 --> 00:16:23,360
 - The day was the day that Neil Armstrong--

512
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:24,400
 - I was gonna say that!

513
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:25,680
 - Stood on the moon.

514
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:27,280
 - The day that he died, all right, yeah.

515
00:16:27,280 --> 00:16:29,880
 (laughing)

516
00:16:29,880 --> 00:16:32,000
 - Yeah, he watched Man Stand on the Moon

517
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,560
 and he thought, I've done something good, actually.

518
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:36,880
 That is extraordinary that we got to watch that through.

519
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:38,360
 - I've never heard of this man before.

520
00:16:38,360 --> 00:16:39,480
 - I know, I hadn't either.

521
00:16:39,480 --> 00:16:40,320
 - Yeah.

522
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:41,760
 - He's big in America, I would say,

523
00:16:41,760 --> 00:16:43,560
 like, Loggy Bird is more famous here

524
00:16:43,560 --> 00:16:45,600
 'cause, obviously, he's Scottish.

525
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:48,800
 But Farm's Worth, I think, is more famous in the US.

526
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:51,000
 - I mentioned Ringo Starr a second ago.

527
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,320
 He actually is relevant because he is part

528
00:16:53,320 --> 00:16:54,920
 of that growing group of celebrities

529
00:16:54,920 --> 00:16:57,360
 that make announcements to say that,

530
00:16:57,360 --> 00:16:58,240
 and you might have remembered,

531
00:16:58,240 --> 00:17:00,040
 Ringo Starr did a video just saying,

532
00:17:00,040 --> 00:17:02,040
 "Please, don't send me anything more.

533
00:17:02,040 --> 00:17:03,440
 "I can't, peace and love, peace and love.

534
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:04,560
 "I can't sign anything."

535
00:17:04,560 --> 00:17:05,480
 - It's pretty cringe.

536
00:17:05,480 --> 00:17:07,000
 It's saying, like, "Screw you guys.

537
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:08,000
 "I don't wanna sign anything for you,

538
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,200
 "peace and love, peace and love."

539
00:17:09,200 --> 00:17:12,200
 But I hate all of you, and I won't sign anything else.

540
00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:13,040
 - He doesn't say that.

541
00:17:13,040 --> 00:17:15,040
 That's absolutely scandalous.

542
00:17:15,040 --> 00:17:16,480
 - A paraphrasing what he says.

543
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:18,480
 - Paul McCartney, supposedly, has done the same thing now.

544
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:20,080
 He won't sign things anymore

545
00:17:20,080 --> 00:17:22,040
 because it just takes up so much of their life.

546
00:17:22,040 --> 00:17:24,600
 If you bumped into Ringo on the street,

547
00:17:24,600 --> 00:17:25,840
 he probably would sign a thing for you.

548
00:17:25,840 --> 00:17:28,200
 He's talking about people sending stuff to his house,

549
00:17:28,200 --> 00:17:29,040
 the responsibility of--

550
00:17:29,040 --> 00:17:31,400
 - His fans have made his career.

551
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:33,240
 - Absolutely, but--

552
00:17:33,240 --> 00:17:34,800
 - I think it's pretty annoying.

553
00:17:34,800 --> 00:17:36,520
 - I think after, how old are they all now?

554
00:17:36,520 --> 00:17:37,360
 - They're in their 80s.

555
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:39,560
 - Yeah, I think it's a big, old treadmill to be on.

556
00:17:39,560 --> 00:17:41,680
 I think anyone who's bought Ringo's Darcello album

557
00:17:41,680 --> 00:17:44,360
 should get stuff signed still,

558
00:17:44,360 --> 00:17:45,200
 'cause that's going on.

559
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:47,080
 - But if you've only ever just watched one episode

560
00:17:47,080 --> 00:17:49,520
 of Thomas the Tank Engine, then that doesn't count.

561
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:51,760
 - And Ringo Rahmer was an absolute classic

562
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:55,040
 of the early 2000s, so don't you dare attack his solo work.

563
00:17:55,040 --> 00:17:58,160
 I went into Hatchards just down the road.

564
00:17:58,160 --> 00:17:59,760
 I was walking past it the other day.

565
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:02,240
 It's a bookshop, it's like the royally appointed bookshop.

566
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:05,120
 And outside was a sign saying signed copies

567
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:06,920
 of Paul McCartney's lyrics book,

568
00:18:06,920 --> 00:18:10,000
 which came out last year inside.

569
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:11,360
 And I dashed in 'cause I thought,

570
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:12,360
 "Oh my God, this is amazing."

571
00:18:12,360 --> 00:18:15,040
 And I said, "I need to get one, how much are they?"

572
00:18:15,040 --> 00:18:16,400
 And it was printed on the sign.

573
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:18,360
 I just hand looked, 10,000 pounds.

574
00:18:18,360 --> 00:18:19,720
 - Jesus.

575
00:18:19,720 --> 00:18:22,480
 - And I then did the classic styling and out go,

576
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:24,640
 "Well, I'll have to check with my wife first."

577
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:26,920
 (all laughing)

578
00:18:26,920 --> 00:18:28,320
 "I'll be back, just keep one for me,

579
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:29,400
 "I'll be back in like half an hour."

580
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:30,240
 - I once did that.

581
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:31,280
 - And I was gonna say, "Have you ever checked with your wife

582
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:33,520
 "about any of the awful purchases you've made?"

583
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:36,080
 - I once went to a kimono shop in Kyoto,

584
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:37,800
 just thinking I would buy a gift

585
00:18:37,800 --> 00:18:40,480
 for my mother-in-law who wanted a kimono.

586
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:43,120
 And they looked at me a bit oddly,

587
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:44,440
 and I said, "No, I really wanna buy one."

588
00:18:44,440 --> 00:18:47,240
 And they brought me in, and they showed me the catalog.

589
00:18:47,240 --> 00:18:50,120
 And they were all about the price of a car.

590
00:18:50,120 --> 00:18:50,960
 Every kimono.

591
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:51,800
 - Oh, really?

592
00:18:51,800 --> 00:18:53,240
 - They're all tens of thousands of pounds,

593
00:18:53,240 --> 00:18:54,680
 every single one. - They're all bespoke, aren't they?

594
00:18:54,680 --> 00:18:56,400
 And they're so re-enwoven and beautiful.

595
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:58,280
 - But it's like, God, how do you get that?

596
00:18:58,280 --> 00:18:59,960
 Well, I mean, they obviously knew

597
00:18:59,960 --> 00:19:01,640
 that I was not gonna pay myself.

598
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:03,120
 It wasn't that embarrassing, but yeah.

599
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:04,760
 - You didn't try the whole check with my wife.

600
00:19:04,760 --> 00:19:06,440
 - You just hacked it out.

601
00:19:06,440 --> 00:19:08,840
 - Did Virginia Wool write a book about a dog?

602
00:19:08,840 --> 00:19:09,680
 - Yeah. - Yeah.

603
00:19:09,680 --> 00:19:10,520
 - Flush. - Yeah.

604
00:19:10,520 --> 00:19:13,120
 - Because that's another thing that Wolf had in common

605
00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:15,760
 with Smythe, is that they both wrote books about dogs.

606
00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:16,600
 - Yeah. - Oh, yeah.

607
00:19:16,600 --> 00:19:18,360
 - Smythe wrote an entire book

608
00:19:18,360 --> 00:19:20,320
 about the dogs that she had owned in her life.

609
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:21,680
 - An entire book?

610
00:19:21,680 --> 00:19:23,520
 - I think that is quite as well.

611
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:26,080
 - Yeah. - 'Cause it could be a chapter

612
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:28,280
 in your memoir, but she wrote loads of memoirs.

613
00:19:28,280 --> 00:19:29,640
 - And she had lots of dogs, didn't she?

614
00:19:29,640 --> 00:19:30,480
 - Yeah, loads of dogs.

615
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:31,320
 - She had enough chapters.

616
00:19:31,320 --> 00:19:32,680
 - She had seven dogs called Pan.

617
00:19:32,680 --> 00:19:33,520
 - Yeah. - Yeah.

618
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:35,600
 - Why did I forget the dogs the same name at this time?

619
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:36,440
 We've talked about this before.

620
00:19:36,440 --> 00:19:38,200
 - When it was Pan one, Pan two, Pan three, Pan four,

621
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:39,360
 like she didn't just keep it a Pan.

622
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:40,640
 - Oh, that's fine then.

623
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:42,000
 (laughing)

624
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:42,920
 - They're at least numbered.

625
00:19:42,920 --> 00:19:44,520
 - I guess there's a nice thing

626
00:19:44,520 --> 00:19:48,160
 of the essential doghood continues, you know?

627
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:49,840
 - The soul passes from one to the next.

628
00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:51,240
 - Well, kind of, yeah, because you know,

629
00:19:51,240 --> 00:19:53,240
 you own a dog and it's Pan and that's your dog,

630
00:19:53,240 --> 00:19:57,160
 and then the spirit moves into the new corporeal form.

631
00:19:57,160 --> 00:19:58,400
 - I wonder if they were the litter of,

632
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:01,600
 if they were the, like calling your son Junior.

633
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:02,920
 - Yeah. - Oh, yeah, maybe, yeah.

634
00:20:02,920 --> 00:20:04,400
 - Donald Trump, the third, whatever.

635
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:05,240
 - Yeah. - She did say

636
00:20:05,240 --> 00:20:08,160
 that she never ever lost a golf ball when playing golf

637
00:20:08,160 --> 00:20:10,680
 because whenever it landed away from the fairway,

638
00:20:10,680 --> 00:20:12,800
 it was always retrieved by one of her dogs.

639
00:20:12,800 --> 00:20:13,640
 - Oh, brilliant.

640
00:20:13,640 --> 00:20:16,560
 - Just brings us back to golf. - Is that a legal move?

641
00:20:16,560 --> 00:20:18,080
 - As long as she still takes

642
00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:19,760
 stroke and distance for losing the ball, it's fine.

643
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:21,600
 - So you can't train your dog to pick it up

644
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:22,760
 and drop it in the hole?

645
00:20:22,760 --> 00:20:23,760
 - No, you can't do that.

646
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:25,080
 (laughing)

647
00:20:25,080 --> 00:20:25,920
 - That's so good.

648
00:20:25,920 --> 00:20:28,120
 Can you really, if it, as in if they just find it,

649
00:20:28,120 --> 00:20:29,400
 so that she doesn't lose it,

650
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:32,040
 but I mean, she has to count it as lost, really.

651
00:20:32,040 --> 00:20:34,480
 - No, maybe she doesn't, if the dog finds it.

652
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:36,160
 - Oh. - Then that's allowed.

653
00:20:36,160 --> 00:20:37,560
 She's got three minutes, basically.

654
00:20:37,560 --> 00:20:39,800
 The dog's got three minutes to find the ball.

655
00:20:39,800 --> 00:20:42,440
 If the dog finds it, then you can carry on playing, I think.

656
00:20:42,440 --> 00:20:44,680
 - I think that would make me more inclined

657
00:20:44,680 --> 00:20:46,360
 to watch golf on TV.

658
00:20:46,360 --> 00:20:48,200
 If every golfer had their own animal.

659
00:20:48,200 --> 00:20:49,680
 - Yeah. - Where they had trained

660
00:20:49,680 --> 00:20:51,680
 with their own method. - Maybe like a truffle pig.

661
00:20:51,680 --> 00:20:52,520
 - Exactly, truffle pig.

662
00:20:52,520 --> 00:20:54,960
 - You could rub your balls in truffles before you played.

663
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:56,440
 (laughing)

664
00:20:56,440 --> 00:20:59,720
 - Sparrowhawk, you dress your ball as a vole

665
00:20:59,720 --> 00:21:02,360
 and then wherever it goes, the hawk dives on it.

666
00:21:02,360 --> 00:21:05,920
 - It would be great if, before each round,

667
00:21:05,920 --> 00:21:07,680
 you sort of, there was a tumbola

668
00:21:07,680 --> 00:21:09,000
 to see which animal you got

669
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:10,800
 and you didn't know which animal it's gonna be.

670
00:21:10,800 --> 00:21:11,640
 - It's like a caddy.

671
00:21:11,640 --> 00:21:12,480
 - Yes. - Or you just got

672
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:14,920
 a random caddy, but it's a random animal.

673
00:21:14,920 --> 00:21:15,760
 - Yeah. - I'm so sorry.

674
00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:18,640
 You've got the goldfish. - The goldfish, yeah.

675
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:20,400
 - The cat, so he's fucked up.

676
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:21,640
 (laughing)

677
00:21:21,640 --> 00:21:25,400
 - The worm, oh, get out of that hole, for God's sake.

678
00:21:25,400 --> 00:21:27,360
 (laughing)

679
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:30,360
 - There have always been fears about TV

680
00:21:30,360 --> 00:21:32,920
 going to ruin you in some way since its invention.

681
00:21:32,920 --> 00:21:34,840
 Like either the early days, it was like,

682
00:21:34,840 --> 00:21:37,760
 people will forget how to read straight away.

683
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:39,440
 And the same thing we have today,

684
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:41,040
 kids addicted to their phone screens,

685
00:21:41,040 --> 00:21:42,320
 their brains are gonna melt.

686
00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:44,240
 And also the fears about the medical stuff

687
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:45,240
 that might happen to you.

688
00:21:45,240 --> 00:21:47,600
 This new technology always freaks people out.

689
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:52,320
 And so in the 1960s, there was a proper scare in America

690
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:55,120
 that everyone was having radiation from their TV screens

691
00:21:55,120 --> 00:21:56,920
 leaking out into their bodies.

692
00:21:56,920 --> 00:21:59,560
 And it was bad, because it was actually found

693
00:21:59,560 --> 00:22:02,680
 at quite high levels of something called X radiation

694
00:22:02,680 --> 00:22:05,400
 leaked out of color TVs, which they just got.

695
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:07,400
 And there were official warnings,

696
00:22:07,400 --> 00:22:09,600
 there were congressmen advised people

697
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:11,880
 to not stand close to their TVs.

698
00:22:11,880 --> 00:22:13,240
 We think that's where the whole,

699
00:22:13,240 --> 00:22:14,560
 you know, when you go to your kids,

700
00:22:14,560 --> 00:22:16,120
 you'll get square eyes.

701
00:22:16,120 --> 00:22:17,480
 - No, this is really interesting,

702
00:22:17,480 --> 00:22:19,760
 'cause this does happen even today with our TVs.

703
00:22:19,760 --> 00:22:22,840
 So, you know, LCD, liquid crystal display,

704
00:22:22,840 --> 00:22:25,600
 the liquid crystals leak, they leak out of the TV.

705
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:26,440
 - Do they? - Yeah.

706
00:22:26,440 --> 00:22:28,440
 Genuinely, scientists examined some dust,

707
00:22:28,440 --> 00:22:30,280
 and they found that nearly half the samples they looked at

708
00:22:30,280 --> 00:22:31,560
 had liquid crystals in them.

709
00:22:31,560 --> 00:22:32,400
 - Really? - Yeah.

710
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:33,240
 'Cause these things are all over the place.

711
00:22:33,240 --> 00:22:34,080
 - And what do they do?

712
00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:34,920
 Are they dangerous to us?

713
00:22:34,920 --> 00:22:35,760
 - Yeah, they mess you up.

714
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:37,680
 - Wow. - No, I don't know.

715
00:22:37,680 --> 00:22:39,280
 I don't know if they've proved exactly

716
00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:40,480
 what long-term effects they'll have.

717
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:42,400
 It doesn't feel good that we might have liquid crystals

718
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:43,920
 in our bodies, you know?

719
00:22:43,920 --> 00:22:44,920
 - It doesn't feel that bad.

720
00:22:44,920 --> 00:22:46,240
 Crystal's quite nice, aren't they?

721
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:47,400
 - Yeah, it sounds quite posh.

722
00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:48,360
 - Quite zen.

723
00:22:48,360 --> 00:22:49,920
 - Oh, great, oh, yeah.

724
00:22:49,920 --> 00:22:53,440
 - The early TVs, they were cathode ray tubes when they,

725
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:55,600
 and that's basically a particle accelerator.

726
00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:56,680
 - Yeah. - Wow.

727
00:22:56,680 --> 00:22:58,520
 - Basically the same as the Large Hadron,

728
00:22:58,520 --> 00:23:00,240
 well, not exactly the same, but, you know,

729
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:02,280
 it's not many steps from one to the other.

730
00:23:02,280 --> 00:23:05,920
 It's accelerating electrons at a screen to make a picture.

731
00:23:05,920 --> 00:23:07,080
 - Yeah, same idea.

732
00:23:07,080 --> 00:23:08,880
 And that's why on old TVs, you know,

733
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:10,080
 you had to have that huge back,

734
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:12,320
 which I didn't realize until, you know,

735
00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:13,840
 we do our cathode rays, because that's,

736
00:23:13,840 --> 00:23:15,800
 you had to have your cathode ray tube

737
00:23:15,800 --> 00:23:17,800
 at a certain distance from the back of the screen

738
00:23:17,800 --> 00:23:19,800
 so it could fire all the electrons

739
00:23:19,800 --> 00:23:21,320
 and it could reach around the screen.

740
00:23:21,320 --> 00:23:22,160
 - Right.

741
00:23:22,160 --> 00:23:23,760
 - And it also meant that to fire the electrons,

742
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:25,520
 that had to be a vacuum.

743
00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:27,480
 - I imagined, and I haven't looked this up,

744
00:23:27,480 --> 00:23:31,200
 but that's why TV screens were always convex shapes,

745
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:33,040
 because that makes them much stronger,

746
00:23:33,040 --> 00:23:35,720
 because the air pressure coming from the outside

747
00:23:35,720 --> 00:23:38,440
 is so great, because it's coming against zero air pressure

748
00:23:38,440 --> 00:23:40,280
 inside, because it's in a vacuum.

749
00:23:40,280 --> 00:23:41,120
 - That's how interesting.

750
00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:44,200
 - And so I'd guess if you smashed your old TV,

751
00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:45,440
 it would all just get sucked in.

752
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:46,280
 - Sucked in.

753
00:23:46,280 --> 00:23:47,920
 - Everyone gets sucked into it, yeah.

754
00:23:47,920 --> 00:23:49,840
 - I think we started off on science

755
00:23:49,840 --> 00:23:52,080
 in that little section.

756
00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:53,080
 - And then we were into, honey,

757
00:23:53,080 --> 00:23:55,480
 I got sucked into the TV, one of the sequels.

758
00:23:55,480 --> 00:23:57,520
 - When rock stars used to throw their TVs

759
00:23:57,520 --> 00:23:59,040
 out of the window of hotel rooms,

760
00:23:59,040 --> 00:24:01,640
 what you didn't see is the people just pulled in.

761
00:24:01,640 --> 00:24:02,480
 - Yeah.

762
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:03,800
 - So many deaths.

763
00:24:03,800 --> 00:24:04,640
 - Oh my God, yeah.

764
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:05,880
 - That's how we always thought there were little people

765
00:24:05,880 --> 00:24:06,720
 inside the TV.

766
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:07,560
 - Yeah, 'cause there were.

767
00:24:07,560 --> 00:24:08,520
 - Just poor souls that, yeah.

768
00:24:08,520 --> 00:24:09,360
 - That's what they are.

769
00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:10,200
 - Yeah.

770
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:11,040
 - Oh man.

771
00:24:11,040 --> 00:24:11,880
 - Right.

772
00:24:11,880 --> 00:24:12,960
 - And there was also a trans-Siberian railway one,

773
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:15,280
 where everyone got in a big luxurious railway carriage,

774
00:24:15,280 --> 00:24:17,200
 and they moved the paintings past the windows

775
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:18,440
 of the sites you would see,

776
00:24:18,440 --> 00:24:20,080
 as you were on the trans-Siberian railway,

777
00:24:20,080 --> 00:24:21,800
 going to Vladivostok or wherever it was.

778
00:24:21,800 --> 00:24:22,640
 - Amazing, that's great.

779
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:23,480
 - So cool.

780
00:24:23,480 --> 00:24:24,320
 - Yeah.

781
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:26,480
 - I mean, bloody cinema came along.

782
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:28,840
 - Well, the thing is, if these were available,

783
00:24:28,840 --> 00:24:30,400
 and they are, we wouldn't go to them.

784
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:33,800
 So a lot of modern art is this kind of thing, isn't it?

785
00:24:33,800 --> 00:24:35,800
 At the Tate, there's an exhibition now.

786
00:24:35,800 --> 00:24:37,000
 Yeah, like Immersive Modern Art,

787
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:39,000
 if you go into like big, yet light shows,

788
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:39,840
 you get insulation.

789
00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:41,160
 - Yeah, you're on Kusama's one at the moment.

790
00:24:41,160 --> 00:24:42,000
 - Exactly.

791
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:42,840
 - But it doesn't feel like it's showing you

792
00:24:42,840 --> 00:24:44,680
 what it's like to go on an interesting train journey.

793
00:24:44,680 --> 00:24:46,960
 And that's what I'm interested in watching.

794
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:49,920
 - When I was in Orlando,

795
00:24:49,920 --> 00:24:51,880
 I'm going to say Universal Studios,

796
00:24:51,880 --> 00:24:55,480
 I got on a train and instead of the windows,

797
00:24:55,480 --> 00:24:57,200
 there were TV screens that made it look like

798
00:24:57,200 --> 00:24:59,160
 you were going to Hogwarts through Scotland.

799
00:24:59,160 --> 00:25:00,000
 - Yeah, brilliant.

800
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:00,840
 - So that's kind of the same thing.

801
00:25:00,840 --> 00:25:01,680
 - Brilliant, yeah, that's what I like.

802
00:25:01,680 --> 00:25:02,520
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

803
00:25:02,520 --> 00:25:03,360
 Yeah, yeah.

804
00:25:03,360 --> 00:25:04,200
 Like I'm up for it.

805
00:25:04,200 --> 00:25:05,840
 Get me on the plane.

806
00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:08,560
 - Yeah, Yori Kusama, who is, yeah,

807
00:25:08,560 --> 00:25:10,280
 she does have an exhibition on at the Tate Modern

808
00:25:10,280 --> 00:25:11,120
 at the moment.

809
00:25:11,120 --> 00:25:14,400
 She's 93 now, so she's been doing her,

810
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:16,160
 you know, she's the one who does the pumpkins,

811
00:25:16,160 --> 00:25:18,200
 like spotty stuff, her famous thing.

812
00:25:18,200 --> 00:25:21,720
 Yeah, there are like pumpkin installations in Japan.

813
00:25:21,720 --> 00:25:24,920
 So in 2021, so when she was 91 or 92,

814
00:25:24,920 --> 00:25:29,920
 she became the first woman in the global top 10 ever artists.

815
00:25:29,920 --> 00:25:32,720
 So first ever woman in 2021.

816
00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:36,480
 - What's the top 10 ever, is that by box office?

817
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:38,440
 - It's by auction sales.

818
00:25:38,440 --> 00:25:40,440
 So it's with the best annual auction total.

819
00:25:40,440 --> 00:25:43,160
 - She lives in a mental hospital in Tokyo,

820
00:25:43,160 --> 00:25:44,000
 doesn't she?

821
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:45,320
 - She does, amazingly.

822
00:25:45,320 --> 00:25:46,400
 Yeah, she had.

823
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:48,840
 - Like as a patient or wow.

824
00:25:48,840 --> 00:25:50,560
 - But she checked herself in.

825
00:25:50,560 --> 00:25:52,200
 - Yeah, she checked in herself, didn't she?

826
00:25:52,200 --> 00:25:54,680
 - Yeah, in like the 70s, I think.

827
00:25:54,680 --> 00:25:56,520
 She had extreme depression.

828
00:25:56,520 --> 00:25:59,440
 And actually one of the things that triggered it really badly

829
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:02,520
 was she was an artist in the 40s, 50s, I guess,

830
00:26:02,520 --> 00:26:04,600
 and she eventually made it to America

831
00:26:04,600 --> 00:26:06,800
 and then created this whole new form of art.

832
00:26:06,800 --> 00:26:08,120
 No one took any notice of her,

833
00:26:08,120 --> 00:26:09,920
 female artists at the time, very difficult.

834
00:26:09,920 --> 00:26:13,200
 And then someone completely imitated what she was doing.

835
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:14,760
 And that really tips her over the edge

836
00:26:14,760 --> 00:26:16,560
 and got very famous doing it.

837
00:26:16,560 --> 00:26:18,800
 So she tipped over the edge then.

838
00:26:18,800 --> 00:26:21,200
 And yeah, tried to commit suicide

839
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:22,920
 and then decided in the 70s,

840
00:26:22,920 --> 00:26:26,360
 she found an art therapist in Japan running a hospital

841
00:26:26,360 --> 00:26:28,680
 which uses art to treat people.

842
00:26:28,680 --> 00:26:30,720
 And she's been living there ever since for 50 years.

843
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:32,640
 And she walks her studios every day,

844
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:35,000
 is probably the most successful female artist

845
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:37,000
 on the planet, in fact is.

846
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:38,400
 And then goes back to her mental hospital.

847
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:40,360
 - The main reason I knew about her is

848
00:26:40,360 --> 00:26:43,000
 because she's mentioned in a lot of kids books now.

849
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:44,040
 - Is she? - It's really weird.

850
00:26:44,040 --> 00:26:47,960
 I would say her and Frida Kahlo.

851
00:26:47,960 --> 00:26:51,520
 Basically, they have a good look to them, right?

852
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:54,320
 And especially Yo-Yo and Kasama's work

853
00:26:54,320 --> 00:26:56,160
 is very accessible for kids

854
00:26:56,160 --> 00:26:58,480
 'cause it's lots of spots and very bright colors

855
00:26:58,480 --> 00:26:59,320
 and stuff like that.

856
00:26:59,320 --> 00:27:01,320
 And so it's kind of nice to see

857
00:27:01,320 --> 00:27:02,520
 that the young generation

858
00:27:02,520 --> 00:27:03,840
 are getting these kind of--

859
00:27:03,840 --> 00:27:06,360
 - Yeah, yeah, my friends took their baby to it actually

860
00:27:06,360 --> 00:27:08,920
 and everyone said they absolutely loved it.

861
00:27:08,920 --> 00:27:10,000
 - Captain Hook?

862
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:10,840
 - Oh yeah.

863
00:27:10,840 --> 00:27:12,040
 - We've actually said before

864
00:27:12,040 --> 00:27:16,080
 what his last words are in Peter Pan.

865
00:27:16,080 --> 00:27:17,320
 Can you remember what they are?

866
00:27:17,320 --> 00:27:18,160
 - In the Disney film.

867
00:27:18,160 --> 00:27:19,000
 - Oh, oh!

868
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:20,040
 - In the book, this is.

869
00:27:20,040 --> 00:27:21,440
 - Is it something about Eaton?

870
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:25,160
 - It is, Floriat Etona, May Eaton Flourish,

871
00:27:25,160 --> 00:27:27,800
 which was the motto of Eaton School

872
00:27:27,800 --> 00:27:30,440
 'cause he went to Eaton, Captain Hook.

873
00:27:30,440 --> 00:27:33,280
 But why didn't know is that J.M. Barry kind of came up

874
00:27:33,280 --> 00:27:35,760
 with like a backstory of all this stuff

875
00:27:35,760 --> 00:27:37,240
 that he did at Eaton.

876
00:27:37,240 --> 00:27:40,000
 And apparently he went to the library

877
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:44,080
 and took out all of the poetry from the Lakeland poets.

878
00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:45,520
 Don't know why.

879
00:27:45,520 --> 00:27:49,160
 He was in a football match and he got tackled

880
00:27:49,160 --> 00:27:52,560
 and it started bleeding the wound where he got tackled

881
00:27:52,560 --> 00:27:56,120
 and it all came out as yellow blood from his leg.

882
00:27:56,120 --> 00:27:57,240
 So he had yellow blood

883
00:27:57,240 --> 00:27:59,040
 and that's one of the things that turned him evil.

884
00:27:59,040 --> 00:28:02,080
 He was like really embarrassed by that.

885
00:28:02,080 --> 00:28:04,120
 - Did he have the hook when he was at Eaton?

886
00:28:04,120 --> 00:28:05,120
 - I don't believe so.

887
00:28:05,120 --> 00:28:07,000
 I think that came out of the crocodile.

888
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:09,240
 - I've never done the crocodile eaton, yeah.

889
00:28:09,240 --> 00:28:12,040
 - And then after he did this whole stuff

890
00:28:12,040 --> 00:28:14,920
 with Peter Pan, apparently he came back

891
00:28:14,920 --> 00:28:17,200
 and he broke into Eaton school

892
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:19,040
 and he stole all of his records

893
00:28:19,040 --> 00:28:21,160
 from the Eaton Society logs.

894
00:28:21,160 --> 00:28:23,920
 And the idea I think being that he didn't want

895
00:28:23,920 --> 00:28:25,520
 to embarrass his old school.

896
00:28:25,520 --> 00:28:27,480
 So he kind of took all the logs out

897
00:28:27,480 --> 00:28:29,000
 as if he'd never been there.

898
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:31,160
 - So he does have some principles.

899
00:28:31,160 --> 00:28:32,120
 He's evil and awful,

900
00:28:32,120 --> 00:28:34,280
 but he doesn't want to embarrass Eaton.

901
00:28:34,280 --> 00:28:36,360
 - Was he called Captain Hook before he lost that name?

902
00:28:36,360 --> 00:28:38,680
 He had to replace it with a hook.

903
00:28:38,680 --> 00:28:39,520
 - What was his name?

904
00:28:39,520 --> 00:28:40,360
 - You're right, yeah.

905
00:28:40,360 --> 00:28:41,320
 - No, he had a name.

906
00:28:41,320 --> 00:28:42,680
 - James Hook?

907
00:28:42,680 --> 00:28:44,240
 - I know it's James Hook.

908
00:28:44,240 --> 00:28:45,080
 - No, I didn't.

909
00:28:45,080 --> 00:28:46,520
 - He's Captain James Hook,

910
00:28:46,520 --> 00:28:48,720
 but I didn't know if he had a previous surname.

911
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:50,160
 - So do you think it was basically

912
00:28:50,160 --> 00:28:52,200
 nominative to terminism that caused the...

913
00:28:52,200 --> 00:28:54,600
 - Pretty much, yeah, yeah.

914
00:28:54,600 --> 00:28:55,440
 - Interesting.

915
00:28:55,440 --> 00:28:56,360
 - Wow, I'd love to see his session

916
00:28:56,360 --> 00:28:58,000
 with the careers advisor.

917
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:02,040
 Well, you bleed yellow, you're evil.

918
00:29:02,040 --> 00:29:04,800
 - Well, you did go to Eaton, so you can be Prime Minister.

919
00:29:04,800 --> 00:29:09,000
 - Another TV innovation from the olden days

920
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:12,320
 that we don't see much these days is the circular TV,

921
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:14,800
 which may be worth bringing back.

922
00:29:14,800 --> 00:29:18,680
 So this was actually quite a big thing in America.

923
00:29:18,680 --> 00:29:20,040
 It never really came to the UK,

924
00:29:20,040 --> 00:29:23,400
 but I think it came about the late '40s

925
00:29:23,400 --> 00:29:25,320
 and then was around in the early '50s.

926
00:29:25,320 --> 00:29:27,200
 It was just a circle screen.

927
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:28,480
 And I think there was an argument

928
00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:29,800
 that that was actually better

929
00:29:29,800 --> 00:29:33,600
 because the old school TVs were all cathode ray.

930
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:37,000
 - So are you missing the corners of the shot

931
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:39,040
 that's been filmed on a square camera lens,

932
00:29:39,040 --> 00:29:42,720
 or are you seeing a gap around the edges?

933
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:44,800
 - Or do they film in with a circular lens?

934
00:29:44,800 --> 00:29:47,680
 - So I read a thing, I think on Reddit,

935
00:29:47,680 --> 00:29:50,240
 and someone very old must have been using Reddit

936
00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:51,880
 'cause they had used these,

937
00:29:51,880 --> 00:29:53,320
 which maybe happens on Reddit,

938
00:29:53,320 --> 00:29:55,800
 but they said you could adjust the rate

939
00:29:55,800 --> 00:29:56,880
 like the average ratio. - So zoom in a bit.

940
00:29:56,880 --> 00:29:58,880
 - So you could zoom in to cut some off

941
00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:01,480
 or you could zoom out to get some cut off.

942
00:30:01,480 --> 00:30:02,880
 - Well, those are the original,

943
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:04,320
 part of the original remotes

944
00:30:04,320 --> 00:30:06,360
 before it was changing channels and stuff like that.

945
00:30:06,360 --> 00:30:08,360
 So it was a cable that was attached to your remote

946
00:30:08,360 --> 00:30:10,840
 and the function was for a zoom in and zoom out.

947
00:30:10,840 --> 00:30:13,560
 So possibly it's to do with the circular TVs.

948
00:30:13,560 --> 00:30:15,520
 - It'd be quite fun to zoom right in on someone's nose

949
00:30:15,520 --> 00:30:17,080
 and then the game is to guess everything

950
00:30:17,080 --> 00:30:19,760
 that's happening in the film as it goes along.

951
00:30:19,760 --> 00:30:20,960
 - And there was also an old one,

952
00:30:20,960 --> 00:30:22,760
 which in order to pick your channel,

953
00:30:22,760 --> 00:30:26,520
 you had to turn the button like you would a phone

954
00:30:26,520 --> 00:30:28,240
 if you were dialing your phone.

955
00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:30,320
 So it had that, you know, an old beautiful.

956
00:30:30,320 --> 00:30:31,160
 - What do you mean phone?

957
00:30:31,160 --> 00:30:32,320
 - So yeah, okay.

958
00:30:32,320 --> 00:30:35,200
 - Sorry, I'm very young, I don't know what you're talking about.

959
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:36,680
 - Yeah, back in the day, those old phones

960
00:30:36,680 --> 00:30:38,120
 that you'd have to spin it around

961
00:30:38,120 --> 00:30:40,320
 that was the gizmo for the-

962
00:30:40,320 --> 00:30:41,400
 - When do you tell that on the remote?

963
00:30:41,400 --> 00:30:42,240
 - Yeah, on the remote.

964
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:43,800
 So channel two when you go.

965
00:30:43,800 --> 00:30:46,160
 - There must be huge remotes or people had tiny fingers.

966
00:30:46,160 --> 00:30:47,600
 Do you have to use your child's fingers?

967
00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:50,320
 - Yes, you would need a child to watch TV.

968
00:30:50,320 --> 00:30:51,600
 - She'd have its finger in.

969
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:53,400
 - No, 'cause your fingers fitted in a telephone thing.

970
00:30:53,400 --> 00:30:54,240
 It's the same-

971
00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:55,880
 - No, but a telephone was big.

972
00:30:55,880 --> 00:30:56,720
 One of those rotary phones.

973
00:30:56,720 --> 00:30:57,560
 - You don't need the rest of it.

974
00:30:57,560 --> 00:30:59,160
 Yeah, it was just a handheld thing.

975
00:30:59,160 --> 00:31:02,400
 It really works when you see the size of it.

976
00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:03,240
 - I believe you.

977
00:31:03,240 --> 00:31:04,080
 - Yeah.

978
00:31:04,080 --> 00:31:06,440
 Sorry, just quickly while we're on sort of terms

979
00:31:06,440 --> 00:31:09,360
 and what people call remotes,

980
00:31:09,360 --> 00:31:14,400
 we now and for, you know, since 1935 basically

981
00:31:14,400 --> 00:31:16,840
 have been known if we watch TV as the viewer.

982
00:31:16,840 --> 00:31:18,840
 And that's a term that we'll always use, you know,

983
00:31:18,840 --> 00:31:20,080
 people say you the viewer at home.

984
00:31:20,080 --> 00:31:20,920
 That's the word.

985
00:31:20,920 --> 00:31:23,560
 And that was a word that came to as a result of the BBC

986
00:31:23,560 --> 00:31:25,960
 having a subcommittee to decide

987
00:31:25,960 --> 00:31:28,040
 what word needed to be used for the viewer.

988
00:31:28,040 --> 00:31:30,640
 So the other things that it could have been

989
00:31:30,640 --> 00:31:32,760
 that were on the shortlist that could have made it

990
00:31:32,760 --> 00:31:34,000
 that we could be saying instead

991
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:37,400
 was we could have been the glancer, the sighter,

992
00:31:37,400 --> 00:31:42,240
 the tele-observist, the visionnaire, or the witnesser.

993
00:31:42,240 --> 00:31:44,640
 - I like that.

994
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:48,160
 I read that looker in was one of the options.

995
00:31:48,160 --> 00:31:50,200
 - The glancer implies they didn't have high hopes

996
00:31:50,200 --> 00:31:51,640
 for us being that focused on the TV.

997
00:31:51,640 --> 00:31:53,120
 It's just on the walk past.

998
00:31:53,120 --> 00:31:54,600
 Give it a quick glance.

999
00:31:54,600 --> 00:31:55,440
 Oh, that was the murderer.

1000
00:31:55,440 --> 00:31:57,280
 Okay, move on.

1001
00:31:57,280 --> 00:31:58,920
 - Just on conductors,

1002
00:31:58,920 --> 00:32:01,960
 'cause Ethel's Mithe was also a conductor.

1003
00:32:01,960 --> 00:32:03,880
 Beat time with a toothbrush, that kind of thing.

1004
00:32:03,880 --> 00:32:05,600
 - Tiders off to a tree to make us have a better one.

1005
00:32:05,600 --> 00:32:06,440
 - Exactly.

1006
00:32:06,440 --> 00:32:09,680
 They often live for a very long time.

1007
00:32:09,680 --> 00:32:12,160
 - Trees are also lightning conductors as well, aren't they?

1008
00:32:12,160 --> 00:32:14,080
 Just, yeah.

1009
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:16,160
 - What trees live for a very long time as well?

1010
00:32:16,160 --> 00:32:18,920
 - I want a cool nickname that would be the lightning conductor.

1011
00:32:18,920 --> 00:32:19,760
 - Yes.

1012
00:32:19,760 --> 00:32:21,080
 - That'd be great.

1013
00:32:21,080 --> 00:32:23,160
 - 'Cause your nickname being lightning, of course.

1014
00:32:23,160 --> 00:32:24,960
 All you need to do is learn to be a conductor

1015
00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:26,240
 and damn it, can't be that hard, can it?

1016
00:32:26,240 --> 00:32:27,080
 - Can't be that hard.

1017
00:32:27,080 --> 00:32:29,760
 It's a stick being waved like it's a Harry Potter scene.

1018
00:32:29,760 --> 00:32:30,720
 It's fine.

1019
00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:36,240
 - And if you're conducting the London Philharmonic Orchestra,

1020
00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:37,480
 and you'd like to tell them it's harder,

1021
00:32:37,480 --> 00:32:38,960
 podcast at qi.com.

1022
00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:39,960
 - So they live for ages?

1023
00:32:39,960 --> 00:32:40,800
 - They live for ages.

1024
00:32:40,800 --> 00:32:43,440
 They stay working into their 80s and 90s,

1025
00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:45,640
 and there are lots of theories about why.

1026
00:32:45,640 --> 00:32:48,000
 And obviously we noticed the ones that stay working

1027
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:49,800
 for until their 80s and 90s.

1028
00:32:49,800 --> 00:32:52,040
 But there are lots of theories about why.

1029
00:32:52,040 --> 00:32:55,200
 My favorite theory is that they flap their arms

1030
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:58,760
 for six hours a day, which is incredible aerobic exercise.

1031
00:32:58,760 --> 00:33:02,240
 Because they've just got incredible upper body exercise.

1032
00:33:02,240 --> 00:33:03,800
 Andy's doing an impression right now.

1033
00:33:03,800 --> 00:33:05,320
 - Low blood pressure.

1034
00:33:05,320 --> 00:33:07,280
 They're listening to beautiful music all day.

1035
00:33:07,280 --> 00:33:08,360
 But it may, like I say,

1036
00:33:08,360 --> 00:33:09,800
 it may be that we just noticed the long-lived ones.

1037
00:33:09,800 --> 00:33:12,920
 'Cause some conductors actually died while conducting.

1038
00:33:12,920 --> 00:33:14,280
 - Oh. - Which is very sad.

1039
00:33:14,280 --> 00:33:16,920
 You know, there was a guy called Giuseppe Sinopoli

1040
00:33:16,920 --> 00:33:20,080
 who died in 2001 while conducting an orchestra.

1041
00:33:20,080 --> 00:33:22,600
 - Struck by lightning. - You can see it though.

1042
00:33:22,600 --> 00:33:23,880
 It's very vigorous pursuit.

1043
00:33:23,880 --> 00:33:26,080
 It's a little bit like Tommy Cooper dying on stage.

1044
00:33:26,080 --> 00:33:27,680
 It's not actually that surprising

1045
00:33:27,680 --> 00:33:30,640
 because it's such a vigorous act you're doing,

1046
00:33:30,640 --> 00:33:33,280
 jumping up and down, bopping around, very stressed on.

1047
00:33:33,280 --> 00:33:34,880
 Whenever you see a conductor, you think,

1048
00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:37,840
 you're moving your body much more than is necessary.

1049
00:33:37,840 --> 00:33:39,640
 And so, no wonder.

1050
00:33:39,640 --> 00:33:41,880
 - There was someone who stabbed his own foot,

1051
00:33:41,880 --> 00:33:43,840
 wasn't there, I can't remember who that was.

1052
00:33:43,840 --> 00:33:44,680
 It was a famous one.

1053
00:33:44,680 --> 00:33:45,840
 - Lili, Jean-Baptiste Lili.

1054
00:33:45,840 --> 00:33:46,880
 - Lili, that's right, yeah.

1055
00:33:46,880 --> 00:33:48,240
 - Sounds like you're doing it wrong.

1056
00:33:48,240 --> 00:33:49,560
 - It was when they had this big staff

1057
00:33:49,560 --> 00:33:50,640
 and he was beating time.

1058
00:33:50,640 --> 00:33:52,120
 And it was a six foot staff you would use.

1059
00:33:52,120 --> 00:33:54,040
 They hadn't rationalized it down to the baton.

1060
00:33:54,040 --> 00:33:55,360
 It was very much like the old mobile phones

1061
00:33:55,360 --> 00:33:56,200
 which were massive bricks.

1062
00:33:56,200 --> 00:33:57,800
 It was like that, but for batons.

1063
00:33:57,800 --> 00:33:59,880
 And he stabbed his foot, he pounded his foot

1064
00:33:59,880 --> 00:34:01,520
 and they got gangried and then he died.

1065
00:34:01,520 --> 00:34:02,360
 - Oh no.

1066
00:34:02,360 --> 00:34:03,200
 - Yeah.

1067
00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:05,360
 - It was the Gandalf to the Harry Potter wand of conducting.

1068
00:34:05,360 --> 00:34:06,200
 That's very cool.

1069
00:34:06,200 --> 00:34:07,040
 - Yeah, exactly.

1070
00:34:07,040 --> 00:34:08,680
 Exactly, yeah, yeah.

1071
00:34:08,680 --> 00:34:10,880
 - She lived quite late.

1072
00:34:10,880 --> 00:34:13,400
 She made it into old age, Ethel.

1073
00:34:13,400 --> 00:34:15,480
 And what's interesting is when I said earlier

1074
00:34:15,480 --> 00:34:16,920
 that she got a Grammy,

1075
00:34:16,920 --> 00:34:19,360
 the piece that she got it for, this 1930 opera,

1076
00:34:19,360 --> 00:34:22,240
 she was 72 years old when she finished composing that.

1077
00:34:22,240 --> 00:34:25,040
 Which is quite a late in the day composition

1078
00:34:25,040 --> 00:34:29,120
 for any artist to then be given an award for, I would say.

1079
00:34:29,120 --> 00:34:31,240
 Especially since she was deaf.

1080
00:34:31,240 --> 00:34:33,120
 Very sad, she went deaf in her fifties,

1081
00:34:33,120 --> 00:34:35,120
 lost her hearing and I think by the end of her life,

1082
00:34:35,120 --> 00:34:36,640
 which is her eighties, was pretty much deaf.

1083
00:34:36,640 --> 00:34:37,760
 Which is why she started doing things

1084
00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:39,280
 like writing stories about her dogs

1085
00:34:39,280 --> 00:34:42,000
 'cause she found music harder and harder.

1086
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:43,720
 And she also went out with,

1087
00:34:43,720 --> 00:34:46,280
 it sounds like very high society people

1088
00:34:46,280 --> 00:34:47,600
 from the list of her lovers.

1089
00:34:47,600 --> 00:34:51,000
 There's Pauline Lady Trevelyan, Lady Mary Ponsonby,

1090
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:52,680
 Violet Gordon Woodhouse,

1091
00:34:52,680 --> 00:34:54,800
 Winaretta Singer of Sewing Machine.

1092
00:34:54,800 --> 00:34:55,640
 - Winaretta?

1093
00:34:55,640 --> 00:34:56,480
 - I say no.

1094
00:34:56,480 --> 00:34:57,320
 - Wow.

1095
00:34:57,320 --> 00:34:59,720
 - The singer, Empress Eugenie.

1096
00:34:59,720 --> 00:35:00,560
 - What?

1097
00:35:00,560 --> 00:35:01,720
 - Yeah, quite a high class name there, yeah.

1098
00:35:01,720 --> 00:35:03,280
 (laughing)

1099
00:35:03,280 --> 00:35:05,480
 I read, so she had a friend who,

1100
00:35:05,480 --> 00:35:06,840
 there was only one man she ever had an affair with

1101
00:35:06,840 --> 00:35:08,200
 who was called Henry Brewster.

1102
00:35:08,200 --> 00:35:10,840
 But then she also had an affair with Brewster's wife.

1103
00:35:10,840 --> 00:35:11,680
 - Yes.

1104
00:35:11,680 --> 00:35:13,760
 - And with Brewster's wife's sister.

1105
00:35:13,760 --> 00:35:16,160
 - Which Brewster was fine with

1106
00:35:16,160 --> 00:35:18,080
 and encouraged it seems like.

1107
00:35:18,080 --> 00:35:19,120
 He was very tolerant.

1108
00:35:19,120 --> 00:35:22,920
 - That is a very open-minded way of thinking about it.

1109
00:35:22,920 --> 00:35:24,920
 - He seems like a really great guy, Brewster,

1110
00:35:24,920 --> 00:35:25,760
 like the real tolerant.

1111
00:35:25,760 --> 00:35:26,800
 - What did he do, who was he?

1112
00:35:26,800 --> 00:35:28,920
 - He was basically her librettist,

1113
00:35:28,920 --> 00:35:30,840
 so he wrote the lyrics to a lot of her operas

1114
00:35:30,840 --> 00:35:32,920
 and they were really close friends.

1115
00:35:32,920 --> 00:35:35,080
 - Does all this not make you think that perhaps

1116
00:35:35,080 --> 00:35:39,400
 a spurned lover or perhaps the partner of a spurned lover

1117
00:35:39,400 --> 00:35:41,200
 was the one who tied her to a tree?

1118
00:35:41,200 --> 00:35:42,960
 (laughing)

1119
00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:43,800
 Does seem that way.

1120
00:35:43,800 --> 00:35:45,680
 - He's fine with it, he encourages my habits.

1121
00:35:45,680 --> 00:35:47,360
 Yes, I have been here for four days.

1122
00:35:47,360 --> 00:35:48,680
 (laughing)

1123
00:35:48,680 --> 00:35:49,800
 - What would you rather not have?

1124
00:35:49,800 --> 00:35:51,840
 Your big toe or your big thumb?

1125
00:35:51,840 --> 00:35:52,680
 - A big toe.

1126
00:35:52,680 --> 00:35:53,520
 - Yeah.

1127
00:35:53,520 --> 00:35:54,340
 - But don't you lose or balance?

1128
00:35:54,340 --> 00:35:56,360
 I guess you'd have an artificial toe put in its place.

1129
00:35:56,360 --> 00:35:58,440
 - Well, what they do is they,

1130
00:35:58,440 --> 00:36:00,200
 so you've moved your big toe to your thumb,

1131
00:36:00,200 --> 00:36:02,840
 they move your other big toe to your other big toe,

1132
00:36:02,840 --> 00:36:04,400
 and then they move your other thumb

1133
00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:05,520
 to replace that big toe.

1134
00:36:05,520 --> 00:36:06,360
 - Yes.

1135
00:36:06,360 --> 00:36:08,240
 - And then they move your ear to replace the thumb.

1136
00:36:08,240 --> 00:36:09,080
 - Yep.

1137
00:36:09,080 --> 00:36:10,080
 - It's like a Rubik's Cube, isn't it?

1138
00:36:10,080 --> 00:36:13,040
 Very frustrating, you can never line it all up.

1139
00:36:13,040 --> 00:36:16,040
 - Maybe this is who Pablo Picasso was painting all this time.

1140
00:36:16,040 --> 00:36:17,680
 (laughing)

1141
00:36:17,680 --> 00:36:18,960
 - You know, we know the creator of Bing.

1142
00:36:18,960 --> 00:36:21,200
 - Oh, fucking hell, do I know him?

1143
00:36:21,200 --> 00:36:23,080
 - Yeah, do you remember in QI,

1144
00:36:23,080 --> 00:36:26,000
 there was a guy called, he was an American inventor.

1145
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:27,240
 He was so cool.

1146
00:36:27,240 --> 00:36:29,440
 Ted Dewan, he was...

1147
00:36:29,440 --> 00:36:31,320
 - I do know him, 'cause I've seen the name

1148
00:36:31,320 --> 00:36:32,760
 and I'm like, that name was, yeah, Ted Dewan.

1149
00:36:32,760 --> 00:36:34,240
 - Yeah, yeah, he was always at the QI club.

1150
00:36:34,240 --> 00:36:35,080
 He was a member.

1151
00:36:35,080 --> 00:36:35,920
 - I hate that shit.

1152
00:36:35,920 --> 00:36:39,840
 I was like, oh, I got so sick and then, oh my God.

1153
00:36:39,840 --> 00:36:41,680
 - Check this out.

1154
00:36:41,680 --> 00:36:43,960
 Just very quickly, I'm sorry, but just very quickly.

1155
00:36:43,960 --> 00:36:46,040
 So R of Street has this WhatsApp group,

1156
00:36:46,040 --> 00:36:47,440
 which I've recently joined.

1157
00:36:47,440 --> 00:36:48,720
 And there's a lady on it who said,

1158
00:36:48,720 --> 00:36:50,200
 "Does anyone have a cassette player?"

1159
00:36:50,200 --> 00:36:51,680
 I've recently found an old cassette,

1160
00:36:51,680 --> 00:36:52,640
 which is 26 years old,

1161
00:36:52,640 --> 00:36:54,480
 from a medium reading that I had.

1162
00:36:54,480 --> 00:36:56,840
 And I want to see how much of what she said is true.

1163
00:36:56,840 --> 00:36:58,040
 So I got very excited.

1164
00:36:58,040 --> 00:37:00,800
 I was like, yes, I totally want to get you.

1165
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:01,720
 So I lied and said, yeah,

1166
00:37:01,720 --> 00:37:03,840
 I've got a cassette player converter thing.

1167
00:37:03,840 --> 00:37:06,520
 And so I'm hopefully going to meet up with her to hear it

1168
00:37:06,520 --> 00:37:07,840
 and see what... - Have you bought a cassette?

1169
00:37:07,840 --> 00:37:09,920
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah, just to, yeah, it's amazing.

1170
00:37:09,920 --> 00:37:10,760
 - You have to be free.

1171
00:37:10,760 --> 00:37:11,600
 - What? Check this out.

1172
00:37:11,600 --> 00:37:15,120
 I was looking her name on the WhatsApp thing.

1173
00:37:15,120 --> 00:37:16,240
 She's called Joe Clegg.

1174
00:37:16,240 --> 00:37:18,680
 And I was like, God, that name just sounds so familiar.

1175
00:37:18,680 --> 00:37:20,680
 And her photo looked a bit professionally taken.

1176
00:37:20,680 --> 00:37:22,320
 So I thought, ooh, okay, maybe she is someone.

1177
00:37:22,320 --> 00:37:24,280
 So I Googled her and it turns out

1178
00:37:24,280 --> 00:37:27,160
 she's written 19 episodes of "Hey, Duggy".

1179
00:37:27,160 --> 00:37:28,200
 (laughing)

1180
00:37:28,200 --> 00:37:30,000
 Yeah, on my street.

1181
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:32,040
 She writes "Go Jedders" and "Hey, Duggy".

1182
00:37:32,040 --> 00:37:33,200
 - Oh my God.

1183
00:37:33,200 --> 00:37:36,080
 I love it if you just turn on the cassette

1184
00:37:36,080 --> 00:37:38,560
 and it just goes, ah, woof, yeah, woof, woof.

1185
00:37:38,560 --> 00:37:40,200
 (laughing)

1186
00:37:40,200 --> 00:37:42,360
 - Hey, Duggy's actually been predicting the apocalypse

1187
00:37:42,360 --> 00:37:43,880
 on every single episode.

1188
00:37:43,880 --> 00:37:46,120
 - We can't understand what he says.

1189
00:37:46,120 --> 00:37:46,960
 - I should do that.

1190
00:37:46,960 --> 00:37:48,200
 That's so funny.

1191
00:37:48,200 --> 00:37:49,040
 - Come on, enough.

1192
00:37:49,040 --> 00:37:49,960
 - Okay, sorry, sorry.

1193
00:37:49,960 --> 00:37:51,040
 - Suburban dad chat.

1194
00:37:51,040 --> 00:37:53,000
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1195
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:54,600
 - So the other thing about Ethel,

1196
00:37:54,600 --> 00:37:56,520
 seeing as we're talking about other composers,

1197
00:37:56,520 --> 00:37:58,560
 she was friends with Tchaikovsky.

1198
00:37:58,560 --> 00:38:01,240
 And Tchaikovsky said of her that Ms. Smithe

1199
00:38:01,240 --> 00:38:03,320
 is one of the few women composers

1200
00:38:03,320 --> 00:38:05,040
 whom one can seriously consider

1201
00:38:05,040 --> 00:38:07,040
 to be achieving something valuable

1202
00:38:07,040 --> 00:38:09,640
 in the field of musical creation.

1203
00:38:09,640 --> 00:38:10,680
 - Great.

1204
00:38:10,680 --> 00:38:13,000
 - Yeah, it's a compliment of sorts.

1205
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:14,120
 - It is to her.

1206
00:38:14,120 --> 00:38:14,960
 - It is to her.

1207
00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:16,240
 - Did you say one of the few composers

1208
00:38:16,240 --> 00:38:17,640
 or one of the few women composers?

1209
00:38:17,640 --> 00:38:18,720
 - Women composers.

1210
00:38:18,720 --> 00:38:20,040
 - Oh, right, it's less of a compliment.

1211
00:38:20,040 --> 00:38:20,880
 Got it.

1212
00:38:20,880 --> 00:38:21,920
 - No, it's a compliment to her,

1213
00:38:21,920 --> 00:38:25,040
 but not much of a compliment to the rest of womankind.

1214
00:38:25,040 --> 00:38:27,240
 But he does also say that since, of course,

1215
00:38:27,240 --> 00:38:29,920
 no English woman can be without her peculiarities

1216
00:38:29,920 --> 00:38:31,440
 and eccentricities,

1217
00:38:31,440 --> 00:38:34,560
 it is no wonder that Ms. Smithe displaced some two.

1218
00:38:34,560 --> 00:38:36,960
 And he gave three peculiarities.

1219
00:38:36,960 --> 00:38:38,640
 One, that she had a dog,

1220
00:38:38,640 --> 00:38:40,320
 which she was inseparable from.

1221
00:38:40,320 --> 00:38:43,840
 Two, was that she really liked hunting.

1222
00:38:43,840 --> 00:38:46,520
 And three, that she liked Brahms.

1223
00:38:46,520 --> 00:38:49,480
 'Cause Tchaikovsky hated Brahms.

1224
00:38:49,480 --> 00:38:50,960
 He really, really hated him.

1225
00:38:50,960 --> 00:38:52,680
 He thought his music was awful.

1226
00:38:52,680 --> 00:38:55,760
 And when Tchaikovsky and Smithe used to hang out together,

1227
00:38:55,760 --> 00:38:57,240
 they used to have nice conversations.

1228
00:38:57,240 --> 00:38:58,520
 And then every now and then Tchaikovsky

1229
00:38:58,520 --> 00:39:01,000
 would go over to the piano, play some Brahms,

1230
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:03,520
 and go, he can't seriously like this.

1231
00:39:03,520 --> 00:39:04,360
 - Really?

1232
00:39:04,360 --> 00:39:05,200
 - This is awful.

1233
00:39:05,200 --> 00:39:06,360
 This is terrible.

1234
00:39:06,360 --> 00:39:08,440
 And that was the only thing they disagreed about

1235
00:39:08,440 --> 00:39:10,000
 was how good Brahms was.

1236
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:11,320
 - She's over here tied to a tree.

1237
00:39:11,320 --> 00:39:14,320
 You can't think of any other peculiarities about me at all.

1238
00:39:14,320 --> 00:39:16,360
 No, that's it, Brahms, that's it.

1239
00:39:16,360 --> 00:39:19,200
 - But then a bit later, Tchaikovsky was invited

1240
00:39:19,200 --> 00:39:21,640
 to a dinner at which Brahms was.

1241
00:39:21,640 --> 00:39:25,080
 And he said he was a very nice person and stuff.

1242
00:39:25,080 --> 00:39:28,320
 And he wrote to Smithe and said,

1243
00:39:28,320 --> 00:39:30,880
 "In Hamburg, I spent a whole day in the company

1244
00:39:30,880 --> 00:39:34,520
 "of your idol, Johannes Brahms."

1245
00:39:34,520 --> 00:39:37,400
 So it was like the one thing that he wanted to say to her

1246
00:39:37,400 --> 00:39:40,600
 was that, you know, he'd been to this guy

1247
00:39:40,600 --> 00:39:42,920
 who he thought was terrible, but she liked.

1248
00:39:42,920 --> 00:39:43,760
 - What did he say?

1249
00:39:43,760 --> 00:39:47,160
 And in conclusion, he was a nice man, but still shit.

1250
00:39:47,160 --> 00:39:48,000
 - Pretty much.

1251
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:51,280
 The exact words were, "He is a very agreeable man,

1252
00:39:51,280 --> 00:39:53,080
 "even though my appreciation of his talent

1253
00:39:53,080 --> 00:39:55,040
 "does not quite tally with yours."

1254
00:39:55,040 --> 00:39:57,000
 - Well, I'm gonna come out and say it, Tchaikovsky.

1255
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:59,240
 I think Brahms is a lot better than you are, so.

1256
00:39:59,240 --> 00:40:00,080
 - Than Tchaikovsky?

1257
00:40:00,080 --> 00:40:01,520
 - Yeah, what are you gonna do about that?

1258
00:40:01,520 --> 00:40:02,840
 Nothing, are you?

1259
00:40:02,840 --> 00:40:04,920
 - There's a kind of sort of always meet your villains thing,

1260
00:40:04,920 --> 00:40:05,760
 isn't there?

1261
00:40:05,760 --> 00:40:06,600
 - Yeah.

1262
00:40:06,600 --> 00:40:08,440
 - As in the best case scenario, you think they're nice.

1263
00:40:08,440 --> 00:40:10,440
 Or worst case scenario, you get fuel

1264
00:40:10,440 --> 00:40:13,360
 for your irrational hatred of them.

1265
00:40:13,360 --> 00:40:15,480
 - Who's would yours be?

1266
00:40:15,480 --> 00:40:16,480
 - My villain.

1267
00:40:16,480 --> 00:40:17,920
 - Yeah, who's your villain?

1268
00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:20,880
 - Can we say on this?

1269
00:40:20,880 --> 00:40:22,440
 - Depends, is it Dan?

1270
00:40:22,440 --> 00:40:24,160
 (laughing)

1271
00:40:24,160 --> 00:40:26,160
 - I sort of don't want to slag off other people

1272
00:40:26,160 --> 00:40:28,000
 in the same line of work as us.

1273
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:28,840
 - Yeah.

1274
00:40:28,840 --> 00:40:29,680
 - Okay, that's tricky.

1275
00:40:29,680 --> 00:40:30,520
 - Oh, right, no, you should have just gone

1276
00:40:30,520 --> 00:40:32,400
 for a historical character or a cartoon character

1277
00:40:32,400 --> 00:40:33,240
 or something, keep it safe.

1278
00:40:33,240 --> 00:40:35,000
 - Well, my dad wrote a porno, don't do this anymore.

1279
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:37,920
 - Oh yeah, my dad wrote a porno, great, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1280
00:40:37,920 --> 00:40:39,440
 - Ooh, Jamie's not gonna like that.

1281
00:40:39,440 --> 00:40:41,600
 (laughing)

1282
00:40:41,600 --> 00:40:43,280
 - Guys, do you remember Jeremy?

1283
00:40:43,280 --> 00:40:44,880
 - Yeah, of course, yes.

1284
00:40:44,880 --> 00:40:49,600
 - He was on "No Such Thing as the News" guest star.

1285
00:40:49,600 --> 00:40:50,440
 - He was a snail.

1286
00:40:50,440 --> 00:40:52,680
 - He was a snail, he was a left-handed snail

1287
00:40:52,680 --> 00:40:54,760
 and they're very rare left-handed snails

1288
00:40:54,760 --> 00:40:56,640
 as we discussed on that show,

1289
00:40:56,640 --> 00:40:58,720
 so they can't mate with any other snails

1290
00:40:58,720 --> 00:40:59,800
 that aren't left-handed

1291
00:40:59,800 --> 00:41:01,840
 and since they're very hard for them to mate,

1292
00:41:01,840 --> 00:41:03,640
 it's 'cause of the way that they're oriented,

1293
00:41:03,640 --> 00:41:06,160
 their genital organs don't match up.

1294
00:41:06,160 --> 00:41:09,360
 But since then, he sadly died in 2017.

1295
00:41:09,360 --> 00:41:11,040
 I believe they did find him a mate in the end,

1296
00:41:11,040 --> 00:41:11,880
 but since then-- - Lasted longer

1297
00:41:11,880 --> 00:41:12,880
 than our TV show.

1298
00:41:12,880 --> 00:41:14,480
 (laughing)

1299
00:41:14,480 --> 00:41:16,080
 - He was constantly recommissioned.

1300
00:41:16,080 --> 00:41:17,440
 (laughing)

1301
00:41:17,440 --> 00:41:18,360
 It's pretty dull, actually,

1302
00:41:18,360 --> 00:41:20,320
 after a while, the Jeremy show,

1303
00:41:20,320 --> 00:41:24,600
 but we now have a way of making him a mate,

1304
00:41:24,600 --> 00:41:27,160
 so you can edit the genes of snails

1305
00:41:27,160 --> 00:41:29,320
 using CRISPR gene editing.

1306
00:41:29,320 --> 00:41:32,360
 The famous always talked about gene editing

1307
00:41:32,360 --> 00:41:34,680
 and when they're eggs,

1308
00:41:34,680 --> 00:41:37,200
 you can inject it with something

1309
00:41:37,200 --> 00:41:38,200
 that tampers with its genes

1310
00:41:38,200 --> 00:41:39,280
 and turns it into a lefty.

1311
00:41:39,280 --> 00:41:40,120
 - That was incredible.

1312
00:41:40,120 --> 00:41:40,960
 - That is really good.

1313
00:41:40,960 --> 00:41:42,040
 - I only laughed there, I'm sorry, Anna,

1314
00:41:42,040 --> 00:41:43,800
 but I laughed because when you said

1315
00:41:43,800 --> 00:41:46,080
 we can now make him a mate,

1316
00:41:46,080 --> 00:41:47,720
 I thought the answer was going to be

1317
00:41:47,720 --> 00:41:49,760
 another new technology, 3D printing.

1318
00:41:49,760 --> 00:41:51,280
 - Oh yeah. - And you print a shell

1319
00:41:51,280 --> 00:41:54,160
 and then you just sort of ram the snail into that.

1320
00:41:54,160 --> 00:41:55,760
 (laughing)

1321
00:41:55,760 --> 00:41:57,000
 It doesn't work, does it?

1322
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:58,280
 - No, I don't think that would achieve

1323
00:41:58,280 --> 00:41:59,680
 anything that they wanted to achieve.

1324
00:41:59,680 --> 00:42:02,440
 - 'Cause they grow the shell, it's living.

1325
00:42:02,440 --> 00:42:04,240
 They don't find them, they grow them right here.

1326
00:42:04,240 --> 00:42:06,480
 Yeah, yeah, yeah, that's why it wouldn't work.

1327
00:42:06,480 --> 00:42:07,560
 One of the reasons.

1328
00:42:07,560 --> 00:42:08,400
 - Yeah.

1329
00:42:08,400 --> 00:42:09,800
 - Yeah, yeah.

1330
00:42:09,800 --> 00:42:11,880
 - Just on Monopoly really quickly,

1331
00:42:11,880 --> 00:42:14,560
 the World Championships of Monopoly,

1332
00:42:14,560 --> 00:42:16,360
 the last World Championships,

1333
00:42:16,360 --> 00:42:19,360
 won by a guy called Nicolo Falcone.

1334
00:42:19,360 --> 00:42:22,240
 How long do you reckon the World Championship game

1335
00:42:22,240 --> 00:42:24,000
 lasted of Monopoly?

1336
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:26,800
 - Oh, more than 12 hours.

1337
00:42:26,800 --> 00:42:28,360
 - An hour and a half before someone

1338
00:42:28,360 --> 00:42:30,240
 just overturned it, right?

1339
00:42:30,240 --> 00:42:31,360
 He used the banker of cheating.

1340
00:42:31,360 --> 00:42:32,200
 - Four minutes.

1341
00:42:32,200 --> 00:42:34,040
 - It was 47 minutes.

1342
00:42:34,040 --> 00:42:34,880
 - Ah, nice.

1343
00:42:34,880 --> 00:42:36,120
 - But that's quite short, isn't it?

1344
00:42:36,120 --> 00:42:36,960
 - Yeah.

1345
00:42:36,960 --> 00:42:39,240
 - And apparently Nicolo Falcone said

1346
00:42:39,240 --> 00:42:41,080
 that if you know the rules,

1347
00:42:41,080 --> 00:42:42,640
 it shouldn't last so long.

1348
00:42:42,640 --> 00:42:44,880
 Like, for instance, you can buy houses

1349
00:42:44,880 --> 00:42:47,120
 when it's other people's turns.

1350
00:42:47,120 --> 00:42:49,200
 You know, if you actually read the rules

1351
00:42:49,200 --> 00:42:51,800
 and don't play it in the way that everyone plays it,

1352
00:42:51,800 --> 00:42:52,960
 then it's actually not that long again.

1353
00:42:52,960 --> 00:42:55,120
 - I read that you could win it in four moves

1354
00:42:55,120 --> 00:42:56,640
 if you knew the rules inside out.

1355
00:42:56,640 --> 00:42:57,480
 - And you were playing so much.

1356
00:42:57,480 --> 00:42:58,320
 No, but that's it.

1357
00:42:58,320 --> 00:43:00,560
 (laughing)

1358
00:43:00,560 --> 00:43:02,600
 - Sorry.

1359
00:43:02,600 --> 00:43:05,200
 - Dan, can I be the knight?

1360
00:43:05,200 --> 00:43:07,520
 - Wait, I keep trying to buy people's bishops.

1361
00:43:07,520 --> 00:43:10,100
 (upbeat music)

1362
00:43:10,100 --> 00:43:15,200
 - And here we are on the other side.

1363
00:43:15,200 --> 00:43:16,040
 That is it.

1364
00:43:16,040 --> 00:43:17,640
 That is all of our bonus bits.

1365
00:43:17,640 --> 00:43:19,720
 If you'd like to get in contact with any of us

1366
00:43:19,720 --> 00:43:20,920
 about the things that have been said

1367
00:43:20,920 --> 00:43:22,640
 over the course of this compilation,

1368
00:43:22,640 --> 00:43:24,360
 we can all be found on our Twitter accounts.

1369
00:43:24,360 --> 00:43:27,760
 I'm on @Sriberland, James is on @JamesHarken,

1370
00:43:27,760 --> 00:43:32,080
 and Andy is on @AndrewHunterM.

1371
00:43:32,080 --> 00:43:34,240
 Anna is, of course, away on maternity now,

1372
00:43:34,240 --> 00:43:36,120
 but if you'd like to write to the four of us,

1373
00:43:36,120 --> 00:43:40,180
 you can get to us on podcast@QI.com.

1374
00:43:40,180 --> 00:43:43,080
 Okay, Club Fishers, that's it for now.

1375
00:43:43,080 --> 00:43:45,440
 We'll see you again next time with another compilation.

1376
00:43:45,440 --> 00:43:46,780
 Goodbye.

1377
00:43:46,780 --> 00:43:49,360
 (upbeat music)

1378
00:43:49,360 --> 00:43:51,940
 (upbeat music)

1379
00:43:51,940 --> 00:43:54,520
 (upbeat music)

1380
00:43:54,520 --> 00:43:57,100
