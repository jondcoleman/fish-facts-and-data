00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580
 (upbeat music)

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:08.880
 - Hey, Clubfish members.

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:11.840
 Welcome to your bonus compilation episode of Fish.

00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:13.020
 This is Biggie.

00:00:13.020 --> 00:00:14.880
 This week we got 40 plus minutes

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:17.040
 and it has everything from, oh, I don't know,

00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:20.120
 weird lullabies to the evils of TV,

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:23.600
 there's books on dogs, Captain Hook's Time at Eaton,

00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:25.200
 and there's Weird Yellow Blood,

00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:26.840
 Neighborly Psychic Readings.

00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:30.280
 It's got a ton, and a lot on Ethel Smythe.

00:00:30.280 --> 00:00:31.320
 You remember Ethel Smythe?

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:34.120
 She's the brilliant conductor-composer.

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:36.680
 She features heavily in this week's episode.

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:39.120
 So enjoy all the bits that didn't make it

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:41.920
 into the main show, and I'll see you on the other side.

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:47.120
 - Emilyne Pankhurst had practised her stone throwing

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:49.200
 in Ethel Smythe's garden.

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:50.160
 - Had she? - Yeah.

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:52.160
 - Supposedly, close by on Hook Heath,

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:53.680
 which was just outside her house.

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:54.520
 - Okay, yeah.

00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:56.040
 - Next to the golf course, by the way.

00:00:56.040 --> 00:00:56.880
 - Ooh.

00:00:56.880 --> 00:00:57.700
 - In case you're wondering.

00:00:57.700 --> 00:01:00.040
 - Are you going for power, or are you going for precision?

00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:02.360
 - I think a bit of both, if you're trying to smash a window.

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:03.200
 - Yeah.

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:04.200
 - At no point throwing it really hard,

00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:05.960
 nowhere near the window, but equally,

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:08.480
 there's no point throwing it really softly at the window.

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:09.320
 - You're right.

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:10.880
 - Golfy, you really do have to nail the two, don't you?

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:11.720
 - That's throwing.

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:12.560
 - It's a lot of practise.

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:13.400
 - Yeah, it's throwing.

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:14.220
 - It didn't pay off.

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:15.760
 Mrs. Pankhurst must have muffed up the shot

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:16.600
 at 10 Downing Street.

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:17.440
 - Oh, no.

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:18.280
 - Yeah, very sad.

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:19.800
 - Where'd it go?

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:20.640
 - 11 Downing Street.

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:21.480
 - Is it still there?

00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:22.320
 Are you wondering?

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:24.600
 - No, churches aren't cross-shaped, are they?

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:25.440
 - Usually, yeah.

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:26.280
 - Really?

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:27.120
 - Yeah.

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:27.960
 - What, the layout, the ground layout was a cross?

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:28.800
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:30.160
 - You see, you know that you get the main doors at the back,

00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:32.880
 and you go all the way up to the front with the altar,

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:34.240
 and there's the head bit,

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:35.920
 and then you've got the two arms across.

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:39.320
 - Never noticed, never had an aerial view of why my church.

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:40.160
 - You can see them from above.

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:41.160
 - The nave and the tranceps.

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:42.000
 - Yeah.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:42.840
 - Wow.

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:45.160
 - And some churches have, you know, the head,

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:47.280
 'cause it represents the cross that Christ on the cross,

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:48.120
 by the blood.

00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:48.960
 - I made that connection.

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:49.800
 - Yeah.

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:50.760
 (laughing)

00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:53.280
 - Like knots and crosses, you see.

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:54.920
 (laughing)

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:58.080
 - The top bit is called the chancel, I think,

00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:01.880
 and some churches, they're not in a completely straight cross.

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:03.280
 They've got the chancel, the head bit,

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:04.680
 is tilted to one side,

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:07.600
 and that represents the drooping head of Christ on the cross.

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:08.960
 It's called a nodding chancel.

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:09.800
 That's what it's called.

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:11.280
 - I do not know that.

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:14.680
 It's Christ being a bit hungry, getting a bit sad.

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:16.320
 - A bit dying, I think.

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:19.480
 - Yeah, I think it's not a snacky thing, it's a...

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:22.120
 - Oh, can someone get me a snack?

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:23.760
 - I'm feeling so hangry.

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:26.240
 (laughing)

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:28.520
 - Do you remember on this show, I'm sure I said this,

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:30.680
 that I once went to an art gallery,

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:33.760
 and there was, I thought someone had collapsed on the floor,

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:35.960
 and I went and told the people and said,

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:36.840
 "Oh, someone's collapsed,"

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:38.920
 and it turned out to be an artwork, and it was a doll.

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:39.760
 - Yeah, yeah.

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:41.720
 - I think, very recently, I read in the news

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:44.000
 that that happened again.

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:45.480
 But this actually got in the news,

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:48.040
 because the person saw the doll on the floor,

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:50.840
 and called 999, and said that someone's collapsed

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:52.160
 in the art gallery.

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:54.120
 And then only when the ambulance came,

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:56.880
 they realized that it was a doll.

00:02:56.880 --> 00:02:59.040
 - It's dangerous, 'cause is this a cry wolf situation,

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:01.120
 where we're all gonna stop reporting crimes,

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:03.120
 calling ambulances, trying to resuscitate people,

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:04.560
 'cause we'll assume everything.

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:05.920
 - Everything is an art, isn't it?

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:08.080
 - Someone's broken into my house.

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:10.180
 I don't think you need to send anyone round.

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:12.240
 (laughing)

00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:13.480
 - It's so hard to know.

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:15.400
 - They look like Tracy M in this.

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:16.360
 - I feel very moved.

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:19.720
 So I think actually on balance, it's fine.

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:20.880
 - I wonder if in early days,

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:22.880
 if people hadn't ever gone to an art gallery before,

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:24.480
 they would see like the Mona Lisa and be like,

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:28.880
 "Someone help her, she's stuck in a frame, in a wall."

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:31.160
 (laughing)

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:32.000
 - Yeah.

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:35.200
 Have you guys heard of the interesting medieval job?

00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:36.560
 The Moss Reeve.

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:37.520
 - Oh, Jesus.

00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:38.720
 (laughing)

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:43.480
 I remember reading the Moss Reeves tale by Chaucer.

00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:45.000
 - And this is someone who adjudicated,

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:47.440
 who was allowed to dig up Pete from Moslands.

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:48.280
 - Is that right?

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:49.880
 - Yeah, 'cause you can't just have it free

00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:50.920
 for a lot of the Moslands.

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:55.360
 - So if I wanted to, if I wanted some Pete,

00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:58.880
 would I go there and then the Moss Wrangler would say,

00:03:58.880 --> 00:04:00.960
 "You're allowed this area or you're not allowed to,"

00:04:00.960 --> 00:04:02.960
 or whatever, or Moss Reeve.

00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:04.440
 Come on, not a Moss Wrangler.

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:06.520
 That's very low in the hierarchy.

00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:07.880
 - Could you believe I'd already forgotten

00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:09.520
 what the word was at that stage?

00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:10.960
 - But here's the weird thing.

00:04:10.960 --> 00:04:13.040
 The two stars of the film, "The Matrix,"

00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:16.120
 are Keanu Reeves and Karrion Moss.

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:16.960
 - That is amazing.

00:04:16.960 --> 00:04:17.800
 - Wow.

00:04:17.800 --> 00:04:19.920
 - Does that prove that we are living, in fact,

00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:24.400
 in a matrix designed by a Moss enthusiast?

00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:25.240
 - Yeah.

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:28.440
 - She, you know, in her time,

00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:31.640
 she was obviously held back, to a certain extent,

00:04:31.640 --> 00:04:32.840
 as a woman composer.

00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:33.800
 She didn't get, you know,

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:35.200
 when people were describing her music,

00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:36.680
 they would always give her criticisms.

00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:37.560
 You would never give a mail.

00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:39.080
 So, you know, it sounds too feminine

00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:40.760
 or she's trying to sound too masculine

00:04:40.760 --> 00:04:42.880
 or, you know, they would always bring her, you know,

00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:43.720
 sex into it.

00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:47.600
 So, it's quite nice that in 2018, she won a Grammy.

00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:48.440
 - Yeah.

00:04:48.440 --> 00:04:49.280
 - Wow.

00:04:49.280 --> 00:04:50.320
 - Yeah, she won a Grammy. - So cool.

00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:53.640
 - And it was for an opera that she wrote in 1930,

00:04:53.640 --> 00:04:54.560
 called "The Prison."

00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:58.120
 So, it was big news for old Ethel.

00:04:58.120 --> 00:04:59.280
 - It's quite nice for her,

00:04:59.280 --> 00:05:01.480
 'cause she said that the thing she was most afraid about

00:05:01.480 --> 00:05:03.040
 when she died was that she'd be forgotten.

00:05:03.040 --> 00:05:05.000
 Her music would be forgotten, sorry.

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:06.640
 So, she was afraid of her music dying with her.

00:05:06.640 --> 00:05:09.880
 And it did, it died dead flat on its back

00:05:09.880 --> 00:05:10.800
 for like 50 years.

00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:12.720
 And now, there's this real revival.

00:05:12.720 --> 00:05:15.040
 She opened "Gleinborn" in 2020.

00:05:15.040 --> 00:05:18.160
 It's like the biggest opera festival in the UK, really.

00:05:18.160 --> 00:05:19.680
 She's played at the proms.

00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:22.240
 So, she is finally coming back.

00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:24.960
 But, yeah, they sound really interesting, her operas.

00:05:24.960 --> 00:05:26.960
 - Yeah, she's got cool song titles as well.

00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:28.320
 I mean, most of them are quite normal,

00:05:28.320 --> 00:05:29.600
 but there's one I came across

00:05:29.600 --> 00:05:31.720
 called "Variations on an Original Theme,

00:05:31.720 --> 00:05:34.600
 Brackets of an Exceedingly Dismal'd Nature."

00:05:34.600 --> 00:05:36.640
 Close brackets in D-flat major.

00:05:36.640 --> 00:05:38.880
 - Nice. - Nice little, yeah.

00:05:38.880 --> 00:05:39.720
 - That's cool.

00:05:39.720 --> 00:05:41.800
 - Actually, on "Deafness and Conductors,"

00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:43.000
 there was a thing of Beethoven

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:45.680
 where he used to insist on conducting his own pieces

00:05:45.680 --> 00:05:47.160
 even after he went deaf.

00:05:47.160 --> 00:05:49.480
 And so, at the premiere of his ninth symphony,

00:05:49.480 --> 00:05:51.920
 he said, "I have to conduct this.

00:05:51.920 --> 00:05:54.080
 You know, it's my pièce de résistance."

00:05:54.080 --> 00:05:56.480
 And there was another conductor, Michael Umlauf,

00:05:56.480 --> 00:05:57.800
 who was on the sidelines,

00:05:57.800 --> 00:05:59.800
 who secretly told the orchestra, "Look at me.

00:05:59.800 --> 00:06:01.120
 Don't look at him." - Oh, really?

00:06:01.120 --> 00:06:01.960
 - Yeah.

00:06:01.960 --> 00:06:02.800
 And when the piece came to an end,

00:06:02.800 --> 00:06:04.160
 Beethoven didn't know it had finished,

00:06:04.160 --> 00:06:05.600
 and he kept on conducting.

00:06:05.600 --> 00:06:07.360
 And one of the musicians had to get up

00:06:07.360 --> 00:06:08.200
 and sort of nudge him.

00:06:08.200 --> 00:06:10.520
 - I remember seeing a movie where that was a scene

00:06:10.520 --> 00:06:12.720
 where he just continues on, and they've all stopped,

00:06:12.720 --> 00:06:15.400
 and he just, he's so into it, and he's waving about.

00:06:15.400 --> 00:06:16.240
 - I remember that.

00:06:16.240 --> 00:06:17.320
 There's a massive dog in it, wasn't there?

00:06:17.320 --> 00:06:19.600
 - Yes, that's right, yeah.

00:06:19.600 --> 00:06:21.680
 There's a Kenyan lullaby which has hyenas in it.

00:06:21.680 --> 00:06:23.360
 - Yeah. - And it goes,

00:06:23.360 --> 00:06:25.280
 "Well, I'll just say it.

00:06:25.280 --> 00:06:26.920
 Rock, rock, rock.

00:06:26.920 --> 00:06:29.560
 The baby who cries will be eaten by a hyena."

00:06:29.560 --> 00:06:30.640
 (laughing)

00:06:30.640 --> 00:06:31.480
 - No.

00:06:31.480 --> 00:06:33.360
 (laughing)

00:06:33.360 --> 00:06:34.200
 - Yeah.

00:06:34.200 --> 00:06:36.000
 And I only mentioned that, in particular,

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:37.920
 because we talked about that.

00:06:37.920 --> 00:06:40.760
 Napoleon Bonaparte one, a few weeks ago now,

00:06:40.760 --> 00:06:42.880
 and it was he'll eat you, eat you.

00:06:42.880 --> 00:06:44.000
 - He'll eat your bones or something.

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:46.360
 - Yeah, every, snap, snap, snap, yeah, yeah.

00:06:46.360 --> 00:06:49.200
 And I only mentioned that because we got an email

00:06:49.200 --> 00:06:50.360
 off the back of that, you know,

00:06:50.360 --> 00:06:54.040
 this Bonaparte era nursery rhyme, from a bloke,

00:06:54.040 --> 00:06:55.440
 and I didn't write his name down, I'm afraid,

00:06:55.440 --> 00:06:58.120
 but he wrote in saying,

00:06:58.120 --> 00:07:02.080
 "I have sung that lullaby to my own daughters

00:07:02.080 --> 00:07:05.320
 about Bonaparte, except in his yard,

00:07:05.320 --> 00:07:07.200
 it goes even further back than Bonaparte,

00:07:07.200 --> 00:07:09.840
 and it was originally about Oliver Cromwell, this rhyme.

00:07:09.840 --> 00:07:10.680
 - Wow.

00:07:10.680 --> 00:07:11.520
 - Oliver Cromwell was the bogeyman.

00:07:11.520 --> 00:07:13.920
 So there are a couple of children,

00:07:13.920 --> 00:07:16.120
 adults now, I believe, in Britain today,

00:07:16.120 --> 00:07:19.480
 who grew up with Cromwell era threats.

00:07:19.480 --> 00:07:20.320
 - So good.

00:07:20.320 --> 00:07:21.160
 - Yeah.

00:07:21.160 --> 00:07:22.360
 - With royalist parents, I assume.

00:07:22.360 --> 00:07:23.200
 (laughing)

00:07:23.200 --> 00:07:24.280
 - Yeah, you can say, yeah, yeah.

00:07:24.280 --> 00:07:26.800
 - Napoleon Bonaparte's better, he'll eat your Bonaparte.

00:07:26.800 --> 00:07:27.640
 - I know, it's great.

00:07:27.640 --> 00:07:29.520
 Never thought of this name like that.

00:07:29.520 --> 00:07:32.680
 - Or your Bonaparte, yeah, even scarier.

00:07:32.680 --> 00:07:33.520
 - Yeah.

00:07:33.520 --> 00:07:35.560
 - If you search who invented the ejector seat,

00:07:35.560 --> 00:07:39.480
 then you usually find someone called Everard Calthrop,

00:07:39.480 --> 00:07:42.360
 who seems to have had a patent in 1916,

00:07:42.360 --> 00:07:45.240
 and he was friends with Charles Rolls of Rolls Royce fame,

00:07:45.240 --> 00:07:47.800
 and Charles Rolls died in a biplane crash,

00:07:47.800 --> 00:07:49.560
 and he thought, well, I'm gonna invent

00:07:49.560 --> 00:07:51.320
 something that would have saved him.

00:07:51.320 --> 00:07:54.800
 Interesting thing about him is he also invented

00:07:54.800 --> 00:07:59.560
 the first modern parachute, and he patented that,

00:07:59.560 --> 00:08:02.360
 and he offered it to the British Air Force,

00:08:02.360 --> 00:08:03.720
 and the British Air Force decided

00:08:03.720 --> 00:08:05.840
 they didn't want parachutes in their planes

00:08:05.840 --> 00:08:07.560
 because they said it might impair

00:08:07.560 --> 00:08:10.000
 the fighting spirit of pilots.

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:14.800
 So basically, if your pilots had a way to escape,

00:08:14.800 --> 00:08:17.000
 they might not fight hard enough.

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:19.040
 - I can understand that, if I were a pilot,

00:08:19.040 --> 00:08:20.960
 I'd pretty much 10 seconds after taking off,

00:08:20.960 --> 00:08:21.800
 I'd be out of there.

00:08:21.800 --> 00:08:23.320
 - It's astonishing though, isn't it?

00:08:23.320 --> 00:08:25.360
 And this was in World War I,

00:08:25.360 --> 00:08:28.560
 and the British refused to let any of their pilots,

00:08:28.560 --> 00:08:30.120
 all the pilots wanted them,

00:08:30.120 --> 00:08:32.600
 the British refused to let their pilots have parachutes,

00:08:32.600 --> 00:08:34.320
 all the other countries had them,

00:08:34.320 --> 00:08:36.080
 because this guy, Cal Throp,

00:08:36.080 --> 00:08:37.960
 he thought, what the fuck is going on?

00:08:37.960 --> 00:08:39.680
 So he published his parachute,

00:08:39.680 --> 00:08:40.800
 he put it in the newspaper, he said,

00:08:40.800 --> 00:08:42.640
 look, this thing, it's amazing.

00:08:42.640 --> 00:08:43.960
 Everyone needs to have it.

00:08:43.960 --> 00:08:46.520
 The British said, no, our guys are not having it,

00:08:46.520 --> 00:08:47.840
 and every other country in the world said,

00:08:47.840 --> 00:08:49.120
 well, of course we're gonna have it.

00:08:49.120 --> 00:08:50.880
 - And who ended up winning that war, James?

00:08:50.880 --> 00:08:55.880
 Good old British and allied Italian as well,

00:08:55.880 --> 00:08:59.360
 yeah, various teams of French.

00:08:59.360 --> 00:09:00.680
 - It's so amazing, isn't it?

00:09:00.680 --> 00:09:02.080
 - But they would just do that.

00:09:02.080 --> 00:09:03.240
 - Yeah, that's incredible.

00:09:03.240 --> 00:09:04.520
 - So speaking of Dickens,

00:09:04.520 --> 00:09:07.640
 in the Tale of Two Cities, he writes,

00:09:07.640 --> 00:09:09.760
 "There was a king with a large jaw

00:09:09.760 --> 00:09:13.400
 "and a queen with a plain face on the throne of England."

00:09:13.400 --> 00:09:15.960
 And he's talking about Queen Charlotte there.

00:09:15.960 --> 00:09:16.800
 - Rude.

00:09:16.800 --> 00:09:20.240
 - Yeah, she's written about a lot at the time

00:09:20.240 --> 00:09:21.960
 as having a plain face.

00:09:21.960 --> 00:09:24.840
 But she was a patron of the arts,

00:09:24.840 --> 00:09:28.120
 she commissioned Mozart maybe for some stuff.

00:09:28.120 --> 00:09:29.600
 - Yeah, that's right, yeah.

00:09:29.600 --> 00:09:32.600
 - And there is a theory, which I must say

00:09:32.600 --> 00:09:35.240
 is not agreed by all historians,

00:09:35.240 --> 00:09:38.080
 that she might have had some African heritage

00:09:38.080 --> 00:09:42.200
 and might have been the first not completely white

00:09:42.200 --> 00:09:44.640
 member of the English royal family.

00:09:44.640 --> 00:09:48.000
 The idea is that the Portuguese side of her family

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:49.600
 might have been related to someone called

00:09:49.600 --> 00:09:53.440
 Margarita de Castro, a Susa who was Moorish.

00:09:53.440 --> 00:09:55.480
 And the idea was that she might have had

00:09:55.480 --> 00:09:58.320
 some black heritage, but like I say,

00:09:58.320 --> 00:10:00.040
 not all historians do agree with that.

00:10:00.040 --> 00:10:02.240
 - Yeah, she had 15 kids.

00:10:02.240 --> 00:10:03.560
 - 15, yeah. - 15, yeah.

00:10:03.560 --> 00:10:04.400
 - That's a lot.

00:10:04.400 --> 00:10:05.240
 - That's a lot.

00:10:05.240 --> 00:10:06.080
 - Do they all make it?

00:10:06.080 --> 00:10:06.920
 No, they can't have fucking things.

00:10:06.920 --> 00:10:08.560
 - 13 made it past childhood.

00:10:08.560 --> 00:10:11.040
 So yeah, she lost two sadly quite early.

00:10:11.040 --> 00:10:12.840
 But 13, yeah.

00:10:12.840 --> 00:10:14.920
 - That's an unbelievable strike rate for those days.

00:10:14.920 --> 00:10:15.880
 Well done. - Yeah.

00:10:15.880 --> 00:10:17.760
 - Taking flights must have been tougher.

00:10:17.760 --> 00:10:18.600
 - Oh my god.

00:10:18.600 --> 00:10:19.920
 (all laughing)

00:10:19.920 --> 00:10:21.160
 Australia, no way.

00:10:21.160 --> 00:10:24.480
 - What kind of pram do you get?

00:10:24.480 --> 00:10:25.720
 Do you have to get one of those prams

00:10:25.720 --> 00:10:27.520
 with like 15 seats side by side?

00:10:27.520 --> 00:10:28.360
 - Oh yeah.

00:10:28.360 --> 00:10:30.080
 - I feel like they do especially make

00:10:30.080 --> 00:10:33.000
 those really long prams just for them.

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:35.760
 Maybe I'm wrong, but I feel like I've seen them as like.

00:10:35.760 --> 00:10:36.600
 - I see them.

00:10:36.600 --> 00:10:37.960
 The ones I see, 'cause there's a nanny

00:10:37.960 --> 00:10:40.160
 who works across the road from where we live

00:10:40.160 --> 00:10:41.080
 and she looks after kids.

00:10:41.080 --> 00:10:42.160
 She always acquires a new kid.

00:10:42.160 --> 00:10:43.000
 And whenever she does this,

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:44.520
 kind of just like a new feature on the pram.

00:10:44.520 --> 00:10:46.600
 It just gets higher and higher.

00:10:46.600 --> 00:10:47.800
 It's like babies sitting.

00:10:47.800 --> 00:10:49.720
 Yeah, it's just, it looks like a transformer

00:10:49.720 --> 00:10:50.760
 that's just got stuck.

00:10:50.760 --> 00:10:52.160
 - Is she building this herself?

00:10:52.160 --> 00:10:53.000
 - It feels like it.

00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:55.920
 But no, I think it's just sort of like extra extensions

00:10:55.920 --> 00:10:56.760
 to each bit of the pram.

00:10:56.760 --> 00:10:57.880
 - That's very cool.

00:10:57.880 --> 00:10:59.440
 - There's a big movement these days, obviously,

00:10:59.440 --> 00:11:01.000
 for trying to stop people

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:03.200
 from smoking almost altogether.

00:11:03.200 --> 00:11:04.520
 New Zealand, for example,

00:11:04.520 --> 00:11:06.640
 if you were born in 2009,

00:11:06.640 --> 00:11:08.240
 you were no longer allowed to buy cigarettes.

00:11:08.240 --> 00:11:12.640
 It is extinct to anyone who is 2009 born and onwards.

00:11:12.640 --> 00:11:14.280
 - How old are they now, 14?

00:11:14.280 --> 00:11:17.440
 - Yeah, so, shouldn't be smoking at that age anyway.

00:11:17.440 --> 00:11:18.280
 - No, exactly.

00:11:18.280 --> 00:11:19.240
 - It is amazing though, isn't it?

00:11:19.240 --> 00:11:21.400
 That like, for us, it was always like

00:11:21.400 --> 00:11:24.360
 you had to look older to get cigarettes.

00:11:24.360 --> 00:11:26.920
 But for them, when they'll have to look younger,

00:11:26.920 --> 00:11:27.920
 when they're 30 years old,

00:11:27.920 --> 00:11:30.160
 they'll be like, are you 30 or 40?

00:11:30.160 --> 00:11:31.640
 And if you're 30...

00:11:31.640 --> 00:11:32.840
 - They will have to look older still.

00:11:32.840 --> 00:11:33.680
 - Oh yeah.

00:11:33.680 --> 00:11:35.520
 - They won't, no one will be going into shops like,

00:11:35.520 --> 00:11:36.680
 I'm five, I promise.

00:11:36.680 --> 00:11:38.840
 (laughing)

00:11:38.840 --> 00:11:40.360
 - But they have to keep looking older.

00:11:40.360 --> 00:11:41.680
 It's not like they can breathe a sigh of relief

00:11:41.680 --> 00:11:43.320
 when they hit sort of 20 and thing.

00:11:43.320 --> 00:11:46.440
 It's even at 50, they'll try to look 60.

00:11:46.440 --> 00:11:47.440
 Oh my God, what a pain.

00:11:47.440 --> 00:11:48.280
 - Yeah, you're gonna want to look older.

00:11:48.280 --> 00:11:50.360
 - Oh God, yeah, load of 50 or what.

00:11:50.360 --> 00:11:52.680
 And around, like they've got fake bus passes

00:11:52.680 --> 00:11:54.040
 and all of this and that.

00:11:54.040 --> 00:11:55.240
 - Yeah.

00:11:55.240 --> 00:11:56.880
 - Didn't put my foundation on today.

00:11:56.880 --> 00:11:58.480
 (laughing)

00:11:58.480 --> 00:11:59.880
 - I have a question for the three of you.

00:11:59.880 --> 00:12:00.720
 - Oh yeah.

00:12:00.720 --> 00:12:03.360
 - Have you ever watched something,

00:12:03.360 --> 00:12:05.960
 a series, for example, in a, like,

00:12:05.960 --> 00:12:08.920
 you've watched ahead without your partner knowing about it,

00:12:08.920 --> 00:12:10.400
 despite the fact you're meant to be watching it together?

00:12:10.400 --> 00:12:11.240
 - Yes.

00:12:11.240 --> 00:12:12.080
 - No.

00:12:12.080 --> 00:12:13.280
 - Okay, two yeses, one no.

00:12:13.280 --> 00:12:15.920
 There was a device developed in 2022

00:12:15.920 --> 00:12:17.520
 that was supposedly gonna deal with this thing.

00:12:17.520 --> 00:12:18.360
 - Oh yeah.

00:12:18.360 --> 00:12:19.180
 - This is a slightly weird thing.

00:12:19.180 --> 00:12:20.020
 It's a slightly PR thing.

00:12:20.020 --> 00:12:21.080
 - Is it called a divorce?

00:12:21.080 --> 00:12:22.640
 (laughing)

00:12:22.640 --> 00:12:24.200
 - So they claimed they'd done a survey

00:12:24.200 --> 00:12:26.120
 and that all of the people who had cheated

00:12:26.120 --> 00:12:29.160
 on their partners in television terms,

00:12:29.160 --> 00:12:30.640
 12% would-

00:12:30.640 --> 00:12:31.840
 - I was just glancing.

00:12:31.840 --> 00:12:34.280
 (laughing)

00:12:34.280 --> 00:12:37.000
 - 12% would re-watch later on with their partner

00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:38.000
 and just not admit.

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:39.080
 I just sort of like go along.

00:12:39.080 --> 00:12:39.920
 Oh my God.

00:12:39.920 --> 00:12:40.760
 - That's what I do.

00:12:40.760 --> 00:12:43.000
 - So anyway, last year,

00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:44.360
 all right, I don't know why it was them who did it.

00:12:44.360 --> 00:12:48.160
 Cornetto, yes, that Cornetto, there's anyone Cornetto.

00:12:48.160 --> 00:12:49.840
 They claimed they had invented this device,

00:12:49.840 --> 00:12:52.000
 these rings that partners would wear

00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:54.240
 and that would then make you unable to watch on

00:12:54.240 --> 00:12:56.440
 in the series without your partner, if you saw what I mean.

00:12:56.440 --> 00:12:58.600
 So you have to be together with your partner,

00:12:58.600 --> 00:13:00.520
 both wearing your special Cornetto rings.

00:13:00.520 --> 00:13:02.560
 - But they obviously hadn't invented that, have they?

00:13:02.560 --> 00:13:03.880
 'Cause that's not the business they're in

00:13:03.880 --> 00:13:05.360
 and why would they do it if it were?

00:13:05.360 --> 00:13:07.000
 - I watched a very slick PR video,

00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:08.320
 which was certainly claimed to have made,

00:13:08.320 --> 00:13:10.780
 not released on April the 1st, I did check.

00:13:10.780 --> 00:13:12.720
 - Does anyone else feel like an ice cream?

00:13:12.720 --> 00:13:13.640
 I don't know why.

00:13:13.640 --> 00:13:15.080
 (laughing)

00:13:15.080 --> 00:13:17.800
 - So why did they, have you dug into

00:13:17.800 --> 00:13:19.040
 whether they've gotten any trouble

00:13:19.040 --> 00:13:20.640
 with the advertising standards agency

00:13:20.640 --> 00:13:22.080
 for making these wild claims?

00:13:22.080 --> 00:13:23.160
 - I haven't, I...

00:13:23.160 --> 00:13:25.160
 - Well, okay, someone dig into that please.

00:13:25.160 --> 00:13:26.720
 (laughing)

00:13:26.720 --> 00:13:30.400
 Actually, on TV based hoaxes,

00:13:30.400 --> 00:13:33.080
 in 1962 there was a hoax in Sweden

00:13:33.080 --> 00:13:36.120
 that tens of thousands of Swedish people fell for

00:13:36.120 --> 00:13:38.240
 and Swedish people today still remember

00:13:38.240 --> 00:13:39.800
 their parents doing this.

00:13:39.800 --> 00:13:41.800
 And this was the era of color TV

00:13:41.800 --> 00:13:43.240
 coming to various different countries.

00:13:43.240 --> 00:13:45.280
 Sweden didn't have color TV yet,

00:13:45.280 --> 00:13:48.000
 didn't get it until 1970, I don't think.

00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:51.000
 But in 1962, Sweden had one TV channel

00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:54.760
 and the only TV channel broadcasts an information video

00:13:54.760 --> 00:13:58.320
 presenting a technical expert called Kjell Stenson,

00:13:58.320 --> 00:14:01.120
 who said, "You can actually make your television broadcast

00:14:01.120 --> 00:14:05.520
 in color by stretching nylon stockings over the screen."

00:14:05.520 --> 00:14:08.760
 And it bends, 'cause it bends the wavelengths of light

00:14:08.760 --> 00:14:10.480
 in certain ways, which then reflect

00:14:10.480 --> 00:14:13.640
 what the original colors were going to be on the screen.

00:14:13.640 --> 00:14:14.480
 - That's very clever.

00:14:14.480 --> 00:14:16.920
 - So it is really very clever.

00:14:16.920 --> 00:14:19.080
 And thousands and thousands of people tried to do this

00:14:19.080 --> 00:14:20.640
 and people still remember their parents

00:14:20.640 --> 00:14:22.080
 were getting these nylon stockings

00:14:22.080 --> 00:14:24.560
 just ruining them, stretching them over the TV.

00:14:24.560 --> 00:14:26.120
 - That's so funny, that's a great,

00:14:26.120 --> 00:14:28.600
 it's a great April though, 'cause it's kind of,

00:14:28.600 --> 00:14:30.440
 it's certainly believable enough to me.

00:14:30.440 --> 00:14:33.480
 - It's low stakes, the worst is someone's going to

00:14:33.480 --> 00:14:35.480
 spoil a few pairs of ties.

00:14:35.480 --> 00:14:36.960
 - Your wife's pissed off when she comes,

00:14:36.960 --> 00:14:38.680
 she's got one pair of nylon stockings,

00:14:38.680 --> 00:14:40.400
 she was saving them for the ball.

00:14:40.400 --> 00:14:43.560
 - I always thought that John Logie Baird

00:14:43.560 --> 00:14:45.560
 was the inventor of the TV and there's probably

00:14:45.560 --> 00:14:47.840
 a lot of controversy about who the true inventor is,

00:14:47.840 --> 00:14:49.880
 but one person who does have a big claim to it

00:14:49.880 --> 00:14:52.240
 is a guy who was called Philo Farnsworth.

00:14:52.240 --> 00:14:56.400
 And he supposedly, according to the story, invented it.

00:14:56.400 --> 00:14:58.160
 He was like a farmer boy and he invented it

00:14:58.160 --> 00:14:59.840
 when he was 14 years old.

00:14:59.840 --> 00:15:01.400
 - Television. - What?

00:15:01.400 --> 00:15:02.240
 - On a farm.

00:15:02.240 --> 00:15:05.320
 He was a teenager, he invented it,

00:15:05.320 --> 00:15:07.760
 and then it got taken over with other people's inventions.

00:15:07.760 --> 00:15:09.160
 It became very bitter about it.

00:15:09.160 --> 00:15:10.360
 He had a few successes with it,

00:15:10.360 --> 00:15:13.000
 but like Silicon Valley people these days

00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:15.600
 who don't let their kids go and use computers

00:15:15.600 --> 00:15:17.360
 and stuff like that, he was exactly the same.

00:15:17.360 --> 00:15:19.720
 He didn't want his kids watching TV

00:15:19.720 --> 00:15:22.120
 'cause he just thought it was a terrible cursed item

00:15:22.120 --> 00:15:25.280
 that ruined you of any intellect or anything like that.

00:15:25.280 --> 00:15:27.640
 So his children have said things that you know,

00:15:27.640 --> 00:15:29.960
 he said there's nothing on it that's worthwhile

00:15:29.960 --> 00:15:31.360
 and we're not gonna watch it in this household,

00:15:31.360 --> 00:15:34.320
 I don't want you on as part of your intellectual diet.

00:15:34.320 --> 00:15:38.040
 And so he hated his invention throughout his whole life.

00:15:38.040 --> 00:15:40.440
 - He thought it was gonna like save the world

00:15:40.440 --> 00:15:42.600
 and stop all wars and stuff.

00:15:42.600 --> 00:15:44.960
 His idea was that it would be a place

00:15:44.960 --> 00:15:46.280
 where people could learn things

00:15:46.280 --> 00:15:47.800
 and learn things about different countries

00:15:47.800 --> 00:15:49.160
 and learn things about the world

00:15:49.160 --> 00:15:50.880
 and people would be so educated

00:15:50.880 --> 00:15:52.560
 they wouldn't want to have wars anymore.

00:15:52.560 --> 00:15:53.400
 - Right.

00:15:53.400 --> 00:15:54.840
 - At least he was disproven quickly, right?

00:15:54.840 --> 00:15:57.720
 'Cause presumably this was 1920s, 30s time.

00:15:57.720 --> 00:15:59.640
 So, you know, he didn't have to wait 50 years

00:15:59.640 --> 00:16:00.720
 before the next big war.

00:16:00.720 --> 00:16:01.560
 - No, yeah.

00:16:01.560 --> 00:16:03.960
 But he did, so he did hate it and hate it and hate it.

00:16:03.960 --> 00:16:06.040
 And then he turned around,

00:16:06.040 --> 00:16:08.720
 just a miracle day changed his mind.

00:16:08.720 --> 00:16:09.560
 - I can guess.

00:16:09.560 --> 00:16:10.400
 - Yeah.

00:16:10.400 --> 00:16:12.280
 - It's the first episode of Breaking Bad.

00:16:12.280 --> 00:16:14.400
 (laughing)

00:16:14.400 --> 00:16:15.240
 - No, it was the--

00:16:15.240 --> 00:16:16.080
 - I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

00:16:16.080 --> 00:16:17.840
 - It was the vertical TV.

00:16:17.840 --> 00:16:19.920
 He thought, no, it's not the vertical TV.

00:16:19.920 --> 00:16:21.160
 - So what was the day?

00:16:21.160 --> 00:16:23.360
 - The day was the day that Neil Armstrong--

00:16:23.360 --> 00:16:24.400
 - I was gonna say that!

00:16:24.400 --> 00:16:25.680
 - Stood on the moon.

00:16:25.680 --> 00:16:27.280
 - The day that he died, all right, yeah.

00:16:27.280 --> 00:16:29.880
 (laughing)

00:16:29.880 --> 00:16:32.000
 - Yeah, he watched Man Stand on the Moon

00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:34.560
 and he thought, I've done something good, actually.

00:16:34.560 --> 00:16:36.880
 That is extraordinary that we got to watch that through.

00:16:36.880 --> 00:16:38.360
 - I've never heard of this man before.

00:16:38.360 --> 00:16:39.480
 - I know, I hadn't either.

00:16:39.480 --> 00:16:40.320
 - Yeah.

00:16:40.320 --> 00:16:41.760
 - He's big in America, I would say,

00:16:41.760 --> 00:16:43.560
 like, Loggy Bird is more famous here

00:16:43.560 --> 00:16:45.600
 'cause, obviously, he's Scottish.

00:16:45.600 --> 00:16:48.800
 But Farm's Worth, I think, is more famous in the US.

00:16:48.800 --> 00:16:51.000
 - I mentioned Ringo Starr a second ago.

00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:53.320
 He actually is relevant because he is part

00:16:53.320 --> 00:16:54.920
 of that growing group of celebrities

00:16:54.920 --> 00:16:57.360
 that make announcements to say that,

00:16:57.360 --> 00:16:58.240
 and you might have remembered,

00:16:58.240 --> 00:17:00.040
 Ringo Starr did a video just saying,

00:17:00.040 --> 00:17:02.040
 "Please, don't send me anything more.

00:17:02.040 --> 00:17:03.440
 "I can't, peace and love, peace and love.

00:17:03.440 --> 00:17:04.560
 "I can't sign anything."

00:17:04.560 --> 00:17:05.480
 - It's pretty cringe.

00:17:05.480 --> 00:17:07.000
 It's saying, like, "Screw you guys.

00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:08.000
 "I don't wanna sign anything for you,

00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:09.200
 "peace and love, peace and love."

00:17:09.200 --> 00:17:12.200
 But I hate all of you, and I won't sign anything else.

00:17:12.200 --> 00:17:13.040
 - He doesn't say that.

00:17:13.040 --> 00:17:15.040
 That's absolutely scandalous.

00:17:15.040 --> 00:17:16.480
 - A paraphrasing what he says.

00:17:16.480 --> 00:17:18.480
 - Paul McCartney, supposedly, has done the same thing now.

00:17:18.480 --> 00:17:20.080
 He won't sign things anymore

00:17:20.080 --> 00:17:22.040
 because it just takes up so much of their life.

00:17:22.040 --> 00:17:24.600
 If you bumped into Ringo on the street,

00:17:24.600 --> 00:17:25.840
 he probably would sign a thing for you.

00:17:25.840 --> 00:17:28.200
 He's talking about people sending stuff to his house,

00:17:28.200 --> 00:17:29.040
 the responsibility of--

00:17:29.040 --> 00:17:31.400
 - His fans have made his career.

00:17:31.400 --> 00:17:33.240
 - Absolutely, but--

00:17:33.240 --> 00:17:34.800
 - I think it's pretty annoying.

00:17:34.800 --> 00:17:36.520
 - I think after, how old are they all now?

00:17:36.520 --> 00:17:37.360
 - They're in their 80s.

00:17:37.360 --> 00:17:39.560
 - Yeah, I think it's a big, old treadmill to be on.

00:17:39.560 --> 00:17:41.680
 I think anyone who's bought Ringo's Darcello album

00:17:41.680 --> 00:17:44.360
 should get stuff signed still,

00:17:44.360 --> 00:17:45.200
 'cause that's going on.

00:17:45.200 --> 00:17:47.080
 - But if you've only ever just watched one episode

00:17:47.080 --> 00:17:49.520
 of Thomas the Tank Engine, then that doesn't count.

00:17:49.520 --> 00:17:51.760
 - And Ringo Rahmer was an absolute classic

00:17:51.760 --> 00:17:55.040
 of the early 2000s, so don't you dare attack his solo work.

00:17:55.040 --> 00:17:58.160
 I went into Hatchards just down the road.

00:17:58.160 --> 00:17:59.760
 I was walking past it the other day.

00:17:59.760 --> 00:18:02.240
 It's a bookshop, it's like the royally appointed bookshop.

00:18:02.240 --> 00:18:05.120
 And outside was a sign saying signed copies

00:18:05.120 --> 00:18:06.920
 of Paul McCartney's lyrics book,

00:18:06.920 --> 00:18:10.000
 which came out last year inside.

00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:11.360
 And I dashed in 'cause I thought,

00:18:11.360 --> 00:18:12.360
 "Oh my God, this is amazing."

00:18:12.360 --> 00:18:15.040
 And I said, "I need to get one, how much are they?"

00:18:15.040 --> 00:18:16.400
 And it was printed on the sign.

00:18:16.400 --> 00:18:18.360
 I just hand looked, 10,000 pounds.

00:18:18.360 --> 00:18:19.720
 - Jesus.

00:18:19.720 --> 00:18:22.480
 - And I then did the classic styling and out go,

00:18:22.480 --> 00:18:24.640
 "Well, I'll have to check with my wife first."

00:18:24.640 --> 00:18:26.920
 (all laughing)

00:18:26.920 --> 00:18:28.320
 "I'll be back, just keep one for me,

00:18:28.320 --> 00:18:29.400
 "I'll be back in like half an hour."

00:18:29.400 --> 00:18:30.240
 - I once did that.

00:18:30.240 --> 00:18:31.280
 - And I was gonna say, "Have you ever checked with your wife

00:18:31.280 --> 00:18:33.520
 "about any of the awful purchases you've made?"

00:18:33.520 --> 00:18:36.080
 - I once went to a kimono shop in Kyoto,

00:18:36.080 --> 00:18:37.800
 just thinking I would buy a gift

00:18:37.800 --> 00:18:40.480
 for my mother-in-law who wanted a kimono.

00:18:40.480 --> 00:18:43.120
 And they looked at me a bit oddly,

00:18:43.120 --> 00:18:44.440
 and I said, "No, I really wanna buy one."

00:18:44.440 --> 00:18:47.240
 And they brought me in, and they showed me the catalog.

00:18:47.240 --> 00:18:50.120
 And they were all about the price of a car.

00:18:50.120 --> 00:18:50.960
 Every kimono.

00:18:50.960 --> 00:18:51.800
 - Oh, really?

00:18:51.800 --> 00:18:53.240
 - They're all tens of thousands of pounds,

00:18:53.240 --> 00:18:54.680
 every single one. - They're all bespoke, aren't they?

00:18:54.680 --> 00:18:56.400
 And they're so re-enwoven and beautiful.

00:18:56.400 --> 00:18:58.280
 - But it's like, God, how do you get that?

00:18:58.280 --> 00:18:59.960
 Well, I mean, they obviously knew

00:18:59.960 --> 00:19:01.640
 that I was not gonna pay myself.

00:19:01.640 --> 00:19:03.120
 It wasn't that embarrassing, but yeah.

00:19:03.120 --> 00:19:04.760
 - You didn't try the whole check with my wife.

00:19:04.760 --> 00:19:06.440
 - You just hacked it out.

00:19:06.440 --> 00:19:08.840
 - Did Virginia Wool write a book about a dog?

00:19:08.840 --> 00:19:09.680
 - Yeah. - Yeah.

00:19:09.680 --> 00:19:10.520
 - Flush. - Yeah.

00:19:10.520 --> 00:19:13.120
 - Because that's another thing that Wolf had in common

00:19:13.120 --> 00:19:15.760
 with Smythe, is that they both wrote books about dogs.

00:19:15.760 --> 00:19:16.600
 - Yeah. - Oh, yeah.

00:19:16.600 --> 00:19:18.360
 - Smythe wrote an entire book

00:19:18.360 --> 00:19:20.320
 about the dogs that she had owned in her life.

00:19:20.320 --> 00:19:21.680
 - An entire book?

00:19:21.680 --> 00:19:23.520
 - I think that is quite as well.

00:19:23.520 --> 00:19:26.080
 - Yeah. - 'Cause it could be a chapter

00:19:26.080 --> 00:19:28.280
 in your memoir, but she wrote loads of memoirs.

00:19:28.280 --> 00:19:29.640
 - And she had lots of dogs, didn't she?

00:19:29.640 --> 00:19:30.480
 - Yeah, loads of dogs.

00:19:30.480 --> 00:19:31.320
 - She had enough chapters.

00:19:31.320 --> 00:19:32.680
 - She had seven dogs called Pan.

00:19:32.680 --> 00:19:33.520
 - Yeah. - Yeah.

00:19:33.520 --> 00:19:35.600
 - Why did I forget the dogs the same name at this time?

00:19:35.600 --> 00:19:36.440
 We've talked about this before.

00:19:36.440 --> 00:19:38.200
 - When it was Pan one, Pan two, Pan three, Pan four,

00:19:38.200 --> 00:19:39.360
 like she didn't just keep it a Pan.

00:19:39.360 --> 00:19:40.640
 - Oh, that's fine then.

00:19:40.640 --> 00:19:42.000
 (laughing)

00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:42.920
 - They're at least numbered.

00:19:42.920 --> 00:19:44.520
 - I guess there's a nice thing

00:19:44.520 --> 00:19:48.160
 of the essential doghood continues, you know?

00:19:48.160 --> 00:19:49.840
 - The soul passes from one to the next.

00:19:49.840 --> 00:19:51.240
 - Well, kind of, yeah, because you know,

00:19:51.240 --> 00:19:53.240
 you own a dog and it's Pan and that's your dog,

00:19:53.240 --> 00:19:57.160
 and then the spirit moves into the new corporeal form.

00:19:57.160 --> 00:19:58.400
 - I wonder if they were the litter of,

00:19:58.400 --> 00:20:01.600
 if they were the, like calling your son Junior.

00:20:01.600 --> 00:20:02.920
 - Yeah. - Oh, yeah, maybe, yeah.

00:20:02.920 --> 00:20:04.400
 - Donald Trump, the third, whatever.

00:20:04.400 --> 00:20:05.240
 - Yeah. - She did say

00:20:05.240 --> 00:20:08.160
 that she never ever lost a golf ball when playing golf

00:20:08.160 --> 00:20:10.680
 because whenever it landed away from the fairway,

00:20:10.680 --> 00:20:12.800
 it was always retrieved by one of her dogs.

00:20:12.800 --> 00:20:13.640
 - Oh, brilliant.

00:20:13.640 --> 00:20:16.560
 - Just brings us back to golf. - Is that a legal move?

00:20:16.560 --> 00:20:18.080
 - As long as she still takes

00:20:18.080 --> 00:20:19.760
 stroke and distance for losing the ball, it's fine.

00:20:19.760 --> 00:20:21.600
 - So you can't train your dog to pick it up

00:20:21.600 --> 00:20:22.760
 and drop it in the hole?

00:20:22.760 --> 00:20:23.760
 - No, you can't do that.

00:20:23.760 --> 00:20:25.080
 (laughing)

00:20:25.080 --> 00:20:25.920
 - That's so good.

00:20:25.920 --> 00:20:28.120
 Can you really, if it, as in if they just find it,

00:20:28.120 --> 00:20:29.400
 so that she doesn't lose it,

00:20:29.400 --> 00:20:32.040
 but I mean, she has to count it as lost, really.

00:20:32.040 --> 00:20:34.480
 - No, maybe she doesn't, if the dog finds it.

00:20:34.480 --> 00:20:36.160
 - Oh. - Then that's allowed.

00:20:36.160 --> 00:20:37.560
 She's got three minutes, basically.

00:20:37.560 --> 00:20:39.800
 The dog's got three minutes to find the ball.

00:20:39.800 --> 00:20:42.440
 If the dog finds it, then you can carry on playing, I think.

00:20:42.440 --> 00:20:44.680
 - I think that would make me more inclined

00:20:44.680 --> 00:20:46.360
 to watch golf on TV.

00:20:46.360 --> 00:20:48.200
 If every golfer had their own animal.

00:20:48.200 --> 00:20:49.680
 - Yeah. - Where they had trained

00:20:49.680 --> 00:20:51.680
 with their own method. - Maybe like a truffle pig.

00:20:51.680 --> 00:20:52.520
 - Exactly, truffle pig.

00:20:52.520 --> 00:20:54.960
 - You could rub your balls in truffles before you played.

00:20:54.960 --> 00:20:56.440
 (laughing)

00:20:56.440 --> 00:20:59.720
 - Sparrowhawk, you dress your ball as a vole

00:20:59.720 --> 00:21:02.360
 and then wherever it goes, the hawk dives on it.

00:21:02.360 --> 00:21:05.920
 - It would be great if, before each round,

00:21:05.920 --> 00:21:07.680
 you sort of, there was a tumbola

00:21:07.680 --> 00:21:09.000
 to see which animal you got

00:21:09.000 --> 00:21:10.800
 and you didn't know which animal it's gonna be.

00:21:10.800 --> 00:21:11.640
 - It's like a caddy.

00:21:11.640 --> 00:21:12.480
 - Yes. - Or you just got

00:21:12.480 --> 00:21:14.920
 a random caddy, but it's a random animal.

00:21:14.920 --> 00:21:15.760
 - Yeah. - I'm so sorry.

00:21:15.760 --> 00:21:18.640
 You've got the goldfish. - The goldfish, yeah.

00:21:18.640 --> 00:21:20.400
 - The cat, so he's fucked up.

00:21:20.400 --> 00:21:21.640
 (laughing)

00:21:21.640 --> 00:21:25.400
 - The worm, oh, get out of that hole, for God's sake.

00:21:25.400 --> 00:21:27.360
 (laughing)

00:21:27.360 --> 00:21:30.360
 - There have always been fears about TV

00:21:30.360 --> 00:21:32.920
 going to ruin you in some way since its invention.

00:21:32.920 --> 00:21:34.840
 Like either the early days, it was like,

00:21:34.840 --> 00:21:37.760
 people will forget how to read straight away.

00:21:37.760 --> 00:21:39.440
 And the same thing we have today,

00:21:39.440 --> 00:21:41.040
 kids addicted to their phone screens,

00:21:41.040 --> 00:21:42.320
 their brains are gonna melt.

00:21:42.320 --> 00:21:44.240
 And also the fears about the medical stuff

00:21:44.240 --> 00:21:45.240
 that might happen to you.

00:21:45.240 --> 00:21:47.600
 This new technology always freaks people out.

00:21:47.600 --> 00:21:52.320
 And so in the 1960s, there was a proper scare in America

00:21:52.320 --> 00:21:55.120
 that everyone was having radiation from their TV screens

00:21:55.120 --> 00:21:56.920
 leaking out into their bodies.

00:21:56.920 --> 00:21:59.560
 And it was bad, because it was actually found

00:21:59.560 --> 00:22:02.680
 at quite high levels of something called X radiation

00:22:02.680 --> 00:22:05.400
 leaked out of color TVs, which they just got.

00:22:05.400 --> 00:22:07.400
 And there were official warnings,

00:22:07.400 --> 00:22:09.600
 there were congressmen advised people

00:22:09.600 --> 00:22:11.880
 to not stand close to their TVs.

00:22:11.880 --> 00:22:13.240
 We think that's where the whole,

00:22:13.240 --> 00:22:14.560
 you know, when you go to your kids,

00:22:14.560 --> 00:22:16.120
 you'll get square eyes.

00:22:16.120 --> 00:22:17.480
 - No, this is really interesting,

00:22:17.480 --> 00:22:19.760
 'cause this does happen even today with our TVs.

00:22:19.760 --> 00:22:22.840
 So, you know, LCD, liquid crystal display,

00:22:22.840 --> 00:22:25.600
 the liquid crystals leak, they leak out of the TV.

00:22:25.600 --> 00:22:26.440
 - Do they? - Yeah.

00:22:26.440 --> 00:22:28.440
 Genuinely, scientists examined some dust,

00:22:28.440 --> 00:22:30.280
 and they found that nearly half the samples they looked at

00:22:30.280 --> 00:22:31.560
 had liquid crystals in them.

00:22:31.560 --> 00:22:32.400
 - Really? - Yeah.

00:22:32.400 --> 00:22:33.240
 'Cause these things are all over the place.

00:22:33.240 --> 00:22:34.080
 - And what do they do?

00:22:34.080 --> 00:22:34.920
 Are they dangerous to us?

00:22:34.920 --> 00:22:35.760
 - Yeah, they mess you up.

00:22:35.760 --> 00:22:37.680
 - Wow. - No, I don't know.

00:22:37.680 --> 00:22:39.280
 I don't know if they've proved exactly

00:22:39.280 --> 00:22:40.480
 what long-term effects they'll have.

00:22:40.480 --> 00:22:42.400
 It doesn't feel good that we might have liquid crystals

00:22:42.400 --> 00:22:43.920
 in our bodies, you know?

00:22:43.920 --> 00:22:44.920
 - It doesn't feel that bad.

00:22:44.920 --> 00:22:46.240
 Crystal's quite nice, aren't they?

00:22:46.240 --> 00:22:47.400
 - Yeah, it sounds quite posh.

00:22:47.400 --> 00:22:48.360
 - Quite zen.

00:22:48.360 --> 00:22:49.920
 - Oh, great, oh, yeah.

00:22:49.920 --> 00:22:53.440
 - The early TVs, they were cathode ray tubes when they,

00:22:53.440 --> 00:22:55.600
 and that's basically a particle accelerator.

00:22:55.600 --> 00:22:56.680
 - Yeah. - Wow.

00:22:56.680 --> 00:22:58.520
 - Basically the same as the Large Hadron,

00:22:58.520 --> 00:23:00.240
 well, not exactly the same, but, you know,

00:23:00.240 --> 00:23:02.280
 it's not many steps from one to the other.

00:23:02.280 --> 00:23:05.920
 It's accelerating electrons at a screen to make a picture.

00:23:05.920 --> 00:23:07.080
 - Yeah, same idea.

00:23:07.080 --> 00:23:08.880
 And that's why on old TVs, you know,

00:23:08.880 --> 00:23:10.080
 you had to have that huge back,

00:23:10.080 --> 00:23:12.320
 which I didn't realize until, you know,

00:23:12.320 --> 00:23:13.840
 we do our cathode rays, because that's,

00:23:13.840 --> 00:23:15.800
 you had to have your cathode ray tube

00:23:15.800 --> 00:23:17.800
 at a certain distance from the back of the screen

00:23:17.800 --> 00:23:19.800
 so it could fire all the electrons

00:23:19.800 --> 00:23:21.320
 and it could reach around the screen.

00:23:21.320 --> 00:23:22.160
 - Right.

00:23:22.160 --> 00:23:23.760
 - And it also meant that to fire the electrons,

00:23:23.760 --> 00:23:25.520
 that had to be a vacuum.

00:23:25.520 --> 00:23:27.480
 - I imagined, and I haven't looked this up,

00:23:27.480 --> 00:23:31.200
 but that's why TV screens were always convex shapes,

00:23:31.200 --> 00:23:33.040
 because that makes them much stronger,

00:23:33.040 --> 00:23:35.720
 because the air pressure coming from the outside

00:23:35.720 --> 00:23:38.440
 is so great, because it's coming against zero air pressure

00:23:38.440 --> 00:23:40.280
 inside, because it's in a vacuum.

00:23:40.280 --> 00:23:41.120
 - That's how interesting.

00:23:41.120 --> 00:23:44.200
 - And so I'd guess if you smashed your old TV,

00:23:44.200 --> 00:23:45.440
 it would all just get sucked in.

00:23:45.440 --> 00:23:46.280
 - Sucked in.

00:23:46.280 --> 00:23:47.920
 - Everyone gets sucked into it, yeah.

00:23:47.920 --> 00:23:49.840
 - I think we started off on science

00:23:49.840 --> 00:23:52.080
 in that little section.

00:23:52.080 --> 00:23:53.080
 - And then we were into, honey,

00:23:53.080 --> 00:23:55.480
 I got sucked into the TV, one of the sequels.

00:23:55.480 --> 00:23:57.520
 - When rock stars used to throw their TVs

00:23:57.520 --> 00:23:59.040
 out of the window of hotel rooms,

00:23:59.040 --> 00:24:01.640
 what you didn't see is the people just pulled in.

00:24:01.640 --> 00:24:02.480
 - Yeah.

00:24:02.480 --> 00:24:03.800
 - So many deaths.

00:24:03.800 --> 00:24:04.640
 - Oh my God, yeah.

00:24:04.640 --> 00:24:05.880
 - That's how we always thought there were little people

00:24:05.880 --> 00:24:06.720
 inside the TV.

00:24:06.720 --> 00:24:07.560
 - Yeah, 'cause there were.

00:24:07.560 --> 00:24:08.520
 - Just poor souls that, yeah.

00:24:08.520 --> 00:24:09.360
 - That's what they are.

00:24:09.360 --> 00:24:10.200
 - Yeah.

00:24:10.200 --> 00:24:11.040
 - Oh man.

00:24:11.040 --> 00:24:11.880
 - Right.

00:24:11.880 --> 00:24:12.960
 - And there was also a trans-Siberian railway one,

00:24:12.960 --> 00:24:15.280
 where everyone got in a big luxurious railway carriage,

00:24:15.280 --> 00:24:17.200
 and they moved the paintings past the windows

00:24:17.200 --> 00:24:18.440
 of the sites you would see,

00:24:18.440 --> 00:24:20.080
 as you were on the trans-Siberian railway,

00:24:20.080 --> 00:24:21.800
 going to Vladivostok or wherever it was.

00:24:21.800 --> 00:24:22.640
 - Amazing, that's great.

00:24:22.640 --> 00:24:23.480
 - So cool.

00:24:23.480 --> 00:24:24.320
 - Yeah.

00:24:24.320 --> 00:24:26.480
 - I mean, bloody cinema came along.

00:24:26.480 --> 00:24:28.840
 - Well, the thing is, if these were available,

00:24:28.840 --> 00:24:30.400
 and they are, we wouldn't go to them.

00:24:30.400 --> 00:24:33.800
 So a lot of modern art is this kind of thing, isn't it?

00:24:33.800 --> 00:24:35.800
 At the Tate, there's an exhibition now.

00:24:35.800 --> 00:24:37.000
 Yeah, like Immersive Modern Art,

00:24:37.000 --> 00:24:39.000
 if you go into like big, yet light shows,

00:24:39.000 --> 00:24:39.840
 you get insulation.

00:24:39.840 --> 00:24:41.160
 - Yeah, you're on Kusama's one at the moment.

00:24:41.160 --> 00:24:42.000
 - Exactly.

00:24:42.000 --> 00:24:42.840
 - But it doesn't feel like it's showing you

00:24:42.840 --> 00:24:44.680
 what it's like to go on an interesting train journey.

00:24:44.680 --> 00:24:46.960
 And that's what I'm interested in watching.

00:24:46.960 --> 00:24:49.920
 - When I was in Orlando,

00:24:49.920 --> 00:24:51.880
 I'm going to say Universal Studios,

00:24:51.880 --> 00:24:55.480
 I got on a train and instead of the windows,

00:24:55.480 --> 00:24:57.200
 there were TV screens that made it look like

00:24:57.200 --> 00:24:59.160
 you were going to Hogwarts through Scotland.

00:24:59.160 --> 00:25:00.000
 - Yeah, brilliant.

00:25:00.000 --> 00:25:00.840
 - So that's kind of the same thing.

00:25:00.840 --> 00:25:01.680
 - Brilliant, yeah, that's what I like.

00:25:01.680 --> 00:25:02.520
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:25:02.520 --> 00:25:03.360
 Yeah, yeah.

00:25:03.360 --> 00:25:04.200
 Like I'm up for it.

00:25:04.200 --> 00:25:05.840
 Get me on the plane.

00:25:05.840 --> 00:25:08.560
 - Yeah, Yori Kusama, who is, yeah,

00:25:08.560 --> 00:25:10.280
 she does have an exhibition on at the Tate Modern

00:25:10.280 --> 00:25:11.120
 at the moment.

00:25:11.120 --> 00:25:14.400
 She's 93 now, so she's been doing her,

00:25:14.400 --> 00:25:16.160
 you know, she's the one who does the pumpkins,

00:25:16.160 --> 00:25:18.200
 like spotty stuff, her famous thing.

00:25:18.200 --> 00:25:21.720
 Yeah, there are like pumpkin installations in Japan.

00:25:21.720 --> 00:25:24.920
 So in 2021, so when she was 91 or 92,

00:25:24.920 --> 00:25:29.920
 she became the first woman in the global top 10 ever artists.

00:25:29.920 --> 00:25:32.720
 So first ever woman in 2021.

00:25:32.720 --> 00:25:36.480
 - What's the top 10 ever, is that by box office?

00:25:36.480 --> 00:25:38.440
 - It's by auction sales.

00:25:38.440 --> 00:25:40.440
 So it's with the best annual auction total.

00:25:40.440 --> 00:25:43.160
 - She lives in a mental hospital in Tokyo,

00:25:43.160 --> 00:25:44.000
 doesn't she?

00:25:44.000 --> 00:25:45.320
 - She does, amazingly.

00:25:45.320 --> 00:25:46.400
 Yeah, she had.

00:25:46.400 --> 00:25:48.840
 - Like as a patient or wow.

00:25:48.840 --> 00:25:50.560
 - But she checked herself in.

00:25:50.560 --> 00:25:52.200
 - Yeah, she checked in herself, didn't she?

00:25:52.200 --> 00:25:54.680
 - Yeah, in like the 70s, I think.

00:25:54.680 --> 00:25:56.520
 She had extreme depression.

00:25:56.520 --> 00:25:59.440
 And actually one of the things that triggered it really badly

00:25:59.440 --> 00:26:02.520
 was she was an artist in the 40s, 50s, I guess,

00:26:02.520 --> 00:26:04.600
 and she eventually made it to America

00:26:04.600 --> 00:26:06.800
 and then created this whole new form of art.

00:26:06.800 --> 00:26:08.120
 No one took any notice of her,

00:26:08.120 --> 00:26:09.920
 female artists at the time, very difficult.

00:26:09.920 --> 00:26:13.200
 And then someone completely imitated what she was doing.

00:26:13.200 --> 00:26:14.760
 And that really tips her over the edge

00:26:14.760 --> 00:26:16.560
 and got very famous doing it.

00:26:16.560 --> 00:26:18.800
 So she tipped over the edge then.

00:26:18.800 --> 00:26:21.200
 And yeah, tried to commit suicide

00:26:21.200 --> 00:26:22.920
 and then decided in the 70s,

00:26:22.920 --> 00:26:26.360
 she found an art therapist in Japan running a hospital

00:26:26.360 --> 00:26:28.680
 which uses art to treat people.

00:26:28.680 --> 00:26:30.720
 And she's been living there ever since for 50 years.

00:26:30.720 --> 00:26:32.640
 And she walks her studios every day,

00:26:32.640 --> 00:26:35.000
 is probably the most successful female artist

00:26:35.000 --> 00:26:37.000
 on the planet, in fact is.

00:26:37.000 --> 00:26:38.400
 And then goes back to her mental hospital.

00:26:38.400 --> 00:26:40.360
 - The main reason I knew about her is

00:26:40.360 --> 00:26:43.000
 because she's mentioned in a lot of kids books now.

00:26:43.000 --> 00:26:44.040
 - Is she? - It's really weird.

00:26:44.040 --> 00:26:47.960
 I would say her and Frida Kahlo.

00:26:47.960 --> 00:26:51.520
 Basically, they have a good look to them, right?

00:26:51.520 --> 00:26:54.320
 And especially Yo-Yo and Kasama's work

00:26:54.320 --> 00:26:56.160
 is very accessible for kids

00:26:56.160 --> 00:26:58.480
 'cause it's lots of spots and very bright colors

00:26:58.480 --> 00:26:59.320
 and stuff like that.

00:26:59.320 --> 00:27:01.320
 And so it's kind of nice to see

00:27:01.320 --> 00:27:02.520
 that the young generation

00:27:02.520 --> 00:27:03.840
 are getting these kind of--

00:27:03.840 --> 00:27:06.360
 - Yeah, yeah, my friends took their baby to it actually

00:27:06.360 --> 00:27:08.920
 and everyone said they absolutely loved it.

00:27:08.920 --> 00:27:10.000
 - Captain Hook?

00:27:10.000 --> 00:27:10.840
 - Oh yeah.

00:27:10.840 --> 00:27:12.040
 - We've actually said before

00:27:12.040 --> 00:27:16.080
 what his last words are in Peter Pan.

00:27:16.080 --> 00:27:17.320
 Can you remember what they are?

00:27:17.320 --> 00:27:18.160
 - In the Disney film.

00:27:18.160 --> 00:27:19.000
 - Oh, oh!

00:27:19.000 --> 00:27:20.040
 - In the book, this is.

00:27:20.040 --> 00:27:21.440
 - Is it something about Eaton?

00:27:21.440 --> 00:27:25.160
 - It is, Floriat Etona, May Eaton Flourish,

00:27:25.160 --> 00:27:27.800
 which was the motto of Eaton School

00:27:27.800 --> 00:27:30.440
 'cause he went to Eaton, Captain Hook.

00:27:30.440 --> 00:27:33.280
 But why didn't know is that J.M. Barry kind of came up

00:27:33.280 --> 00:27:35.760
 with like a backstory of all this stuff

00:27:35.760 --> 00:27:37.240
 that he did at Eaton.

00:27:37.240 --> 00:27:40.000
 And apparently he went to the library

00:27:40.000 --> 00:27:44.080
 and took out all of the poetry from the Lakeland poets.

00:27:44.080 --> 00:27:45.520
 Don't know why.

00:27:45.520 --> 00:27:49.160
 He was in a football match and he got tackled

00:27:49.160 --> 00:27:52.560
 and it started bleeding the wound where he got tackled

00:27:52.560 --> 00:27:56.120
 and it all came out as yellow blood from his leg.

00:27:56.120 --> 00:27:57.240
 So he had yellow blood

00:27:57.240 --> 00:27:59.040
 and that's one of the things that turned him evil.

00:27:59.040 --> 00:28:02.080
 He was like really embarrassed by that.

00:28:02.080 --> 00:28:04.120
 - Did he have the hook when he was at Eaton?

00:28:04.120 --> 00:28:05.120
 - I don't believe so.

00:28:05.120 --> 00:28:07.000
 I think that came out of the crocodile.

00:28:07.000 --> 00:28:09.240
 - I've never done the crocodile eaton, yeah.

00:28:09.240 --> 00:28:12.040
 - And then after he did this whole stuff

00:28:12.040 --> 00:28:14.920
 with Peter Pan, apparently he came back

00:28:14.920 --> 00:28:17.200
 and he broke into Eaton school

00:28:17.200 --> 00:28:19.040
 and he stole all of his records

00:28:19.040 --> 00:28:21.160
 from the Eaton Society logs.

00:28:21.160 --> 00:28:23.920
 And the idea I think being that he didn't want

00:28:23.920 --> 00:28:25.520
 to embarrass his old school.

00:28:25.520 --> 00:28:27.480
 So he kind of took all the logs out

00:28:27.480 --> 00:28:29.000
 as if he'd never been there.

00:28:29.000 --> 00:28:31.160
 - So he does have some principles.

00:28:31.160 --> 00:28:32.120
 He's evil and awful,

00:28:32.120 --> 00:28:34.280
 but he doesn't want to embarrass Eaton.

00:28:34.280 --> 00:28:36.360
 - Was he called Captain Hook before he lost that name?

00:28:36.360 --> 00:28:38.680
 He had to replace it with a hook.

00:28:38.680 --> 00:28:39.520
 - What was his name?

00:28:39.520 --> 00:28:40.360
 - You're right, yeah.

00:28:40.360 --> 00:28:41.320
 - No, he had a name.

00:28:41.320 --> 00:28:42.680
 - James Hook?

00:28:42.680 --> 00:28:44.240
 - I know it's James Hook.

00:28:44.240 --> 00:28:45.080
 - No, I didn't.

00:28:45.080 --> 00:28:46.520
 - He's Captain James Hook,

00:28:46.520 --> 00:28:48.720
 but I didn't know if he had a previous surname.

00:28:48.720 --> 00:28:50.160
 - So do you think it was basically

00:28:50.160 --> 00:28:52.200
 nominative to terminism that caused the...

00:28:52.200 --> 00:28:54.600
 - Pretty much, yeah, yeah.

00:28:54.600 --> 00:28:55.440
 - Interesting.

00:28:55.440 --> 00:28:56.360
 - Wow, I'd love to see his session

00:28:56.360 --> 00:28:58.000
 with the careers advisor.

00:28:58.000 --> 00:29:02.040
 Well, you bleed yellow, you're evil.

00:29:02.040 --> 00:29:04.800
 - Well, you did go to Eaton, so you can be Prime Minister.

00:29:04.800 --> 00:29:09.000
 - Another TV innovation from the olden days

00:29:09.000 --> 00:29:12.320
 that we don't see much these days is the circular TV,

00:29:12.320 --> 00:29:14.800
 which may be worth bringing back.

00:29:14.800 --> 00:29:18.680
 So this was actually quite a big thing in America.

00:29:18.680 --> 00:29:20.040
 It never really came to the UK,

00:29:20.040 --> 00:29:23.400
 but I think it came about the late '40s

00:29:23.400 --> 00:29:25.320
 and then was around in the early '50s.

00:29:25.320 --> 00:29:27.200
 It was just a circle screen.

00:29:27.200 --> 00:29:28.480
 And I think there was an argument

00:29:28.480 --> 00:29:29.800
 that that was actually better

00:29:29.800 --> 00:29:33.600
 because the old school TVs were all cathode ray.

00:29:33.600 --> 00:29:37.000
 - So are you missing the corners of the shot

00:29:37.000 --> 00:29:39.040
 that's been filmed on a square camera lens,

00:29:39.040 --> 00:29:42.720
 or are you seeing a gap around the edges?

00:29:42.720 --> 00:29:44.800
 - Or do they film in with a circular lens?

00:29:44.800 --> 00:29:47.680
 - So I read a thing, I think on Reddit,

00:29:47.680 --> 00:29:50.240
 and someone very old must have been using Reddit

00:29:50.240 --> 00:29:51.880
 'cause they had used these,

00:29:51.880 --> 00:29:53.320
 which maybe happens on Reddit,

00:29:53.320 --> 00:29:55.800
 but they said you could adjust the rate

00:29:55.800 --> 00:29:56.880
 like the average ratio. - So zoom in a bit.

00:29:56.880 --> 00:29:58.880
 - So you could zoom in to cut some off

00:29:58.880 --> 00:30:01.480
 or you could zoom out to get some cut off.

00:30:01.480 --> 00:30:02.880
 - Well, those are the original,

00:30:02.880 --> 00:30:04.320
 part of the original remotes

00:30:04.320 --> 00:30:06.360
 before it was changing channels and stuff like that.

00:30:06.360 --> 00:30:08.360
 So it was a cable that was attached to your remote

00:30:08.360 --> 00:30:10.840
 and the function was for a zoom in and zoom out.

00:30:10.840 --> 00:30:13.560
 So possibly it's to do with the circular TVs.

00:30:13.560 --> 00:30:15.520
 - It'd be quite fun to zoom right in on someone's nose

00:30:15.520 --> 00:30:17.080
 and then the game is to guess everything

00:30:17.080 --> 00:30:19.760
 that's happening in the film as it goes along.

00:30:19.760 --> 00:30:20.960
 - And there was also an old one,

00:30:20.960 --> 00:30:22.760
 which in order to pick your channel,

00:30:22.760 --> 00:30:26.520
 you had to turn the button like you would a phone

00:30:26.520 --> 00:30:28.240
 if you were dialing your phone.

00:30:28.240 --> 00:30:30.320
 So it had that, you know, an old beautiful.

00:30:30.320 --> 00:30:31.160
 - What do you mean phone?

00:30:31.160 --> 00:30:32.320
 - So yeah, okay.

00:30:32.320 --> 00:30:35.200
 - Sorry, I'm very young, I don't know what you're talking about.

00:30:35.200 --> 00:30:36.680
 - Yeah, back in the day, those old phones

00:30:36.680 --> 00:30:38.120
 that you'd have to spin it around

00:30:38.120 --> 00:30:40.320
 that was the gizmo for the-

00:30:40.320 --> 00:30:41.400
 - When do you tell that on the remote?

00:30:41.400 --> 00:30:42.240
 - Yeah, on the remote.

00:30:42.240 --> 00:30:43.800
 So channel two when you go.

00:30:43.800 --> 00:30:46.160
 - There must be huge remotes or people had tiny fingers.

00:30:46.160 --> 00:30:47.600
 Do you have to use your child's fingers?

00:30:47.600 --> 00:30:50.320
 - Yes, you would need a child to watch TV.

00:30:50.320 --> 00:30:51.600
 - She'd have its finger in.

00:30:51.600 --> 00:30:53.400
 - No, 'cause your fingers fitted in a telephone thing.

00:30:53.400 --> 00:30:54.240
 It's the same-

00:30:54.240 --> 00:30:55.880
 - No, but a telephone was big.

00:30:55.880 --> 00:30:56.720
 One of those rotary phones.

00:30:56.720 --> 00:30:57.560
 - You don't need the rest of it.

00:30:57.560 --> 00:30:59.160
 Yeah, it was just a handheld thing.

00:30:59.160 --> 00:31:02.400
 It really works when you see the size of it.

00:31:02.400 --> 00:31:03.240
 - I believe you.

00:31:03.240 --> 00:31:04.080
 - Yeah.

00:31:04.080 --> 00:31:06.440
 Sorry, just quickly while we're on sort of terms

00:31:06.440 --> 00:31:09.360
 and what people call remotes,

00:31:09.360 --> 00:31:14.400
 we now and for, you know, since 1935 basically

00:31:14.400 --> 00:31:16.840
 have been known if we watch TV as the viewer.

00:31:16.840 --> 00:31:18.840
 And that's a term that we'll always use, you know,

00:31:18.840 --> 00:31:20.080
 people say you the viewer at home.

00:31:20.080 --> 00:31:20.920
 That's the word.

00:31:20.920 --> 00:31:23.560
 And that was a word that came to as a result of the BBC

00:31:23.560 --> 00:31:25.960
 having a subcommittee to decide

00:31:25.960 --> 00:31:28.040
 what word needed to be used for the viewer.

00:31:28.040 --> 00:31:30.640
 So the other things that it could have been

00:31:30.640 --> 00:31:32.760
 that were on the shortlist that could have made it

00:31:32.760 --> 00:31:34.000
 that we could be saying instead

00:31:34.000 --> 00:31:37.400
 was we could have been the glancer, the sighter,

00:31:37.400 --> 00:31:42.240
 the tele-observist, the visionnaire, or the witnesser.

00:31:42.240 --> 00:31:44.640
 - I like that.

00:31:44.640 --> 00:31:48.160
 I read that looker in was one of the options.

00:31:48.160 --> 00:31:50.200
 - The glancer implies they didn't have high hopes

00:31:50.200 --> 00:31:51.640
 for us being that focused on the TV.

00:31:51.640 --> 00:31:53.120
 It's just on the walk past.

00:31:53.120 --> 00:31:54.600
 Give it a quick glance.

00:31:54.600 --> 00:31:55.440
 Oh, that was the murderer.

00:31:55.440 --> 00:31:57.280
 Okay, move on.

00:31:57.280 --> 00:31:58.920
 - Just on conductors,

00:31:58.920 --> 00:32:01.960
 'cause Ethel's Mithe was also a conductor.

00:32:01.960 --> 00:32:03.880
 Beat time with a toothbrush, that kind of thing.

00:32:03.880 --> 00:32:05.600
 - Tiders off to a tree to make us have a better one.

00:32:05.600 --> 00:32:06.440
 - Exactly.

00:32:06.440 --> 00:32:09.680
 They often live for a very long time.

00:32:09.680 --> 00:32:12.160
 - Trees are also lightning conductors as well, aren't they?

00:32:12.160 --> 00:32:14.080
 Just, yeah.

00:32:14.080 --> 00:32:16.160
 - What trees live for a very long time as well?

00:32:16.160 --> 00:32:18.920
 - I want a cool nickname that would be the lightning conductor.

00:32:18.920 --> 00:32:19.760
 - Yes.

00:32:19.760 --> 00:32:21.080
 - That'd be great.

00:32:21.080 --> 00:32:23.160
 - 'Cause your nickname being lightning, of course.

00:32:23.160 --> 00:32:24.960
 All you need to do is learn to be a conductor

00:32:24.960 --> 00:32:26.240
 and damn it, can't be that hard, can it?

00:32:26.240 --> 00:32:27.080
 - Can't be that hard.

00:32:27.080 --> 00:32:29.760
 It's a stick being waved like it's a Harry Potter scene.

00:32:29.760 --> 00:32:30.720
 It's fine.

00:32:32.720 --> 00:32:36.240
 - And if you're conducting the London Philharmonic Orchestra,

00:32:36.240 --> 00:32:37.480
 and you'd like to tell them it's harder,

00:32:37.480 --> 00:32:38.960
 podcast at qi.com.

00:32:38.960 --> 00:32:39.960
 - So they live for ages?

00:32:39.960 --> 00:32:40.800
 - They live for ages.

00:32:40.800 --> 00:32:43.440
 They stay working into their 80s and 90s,

00:32:43.440 --> 00:32:45.640
 and there are lots of theories about why.

00:32:45.640 --> 00:32:48.000
 And obviously we noticed the ones that stay working

00:32:48.000 --> 00:32:49.800
 for until their 80s and 90s.

00:32:49.800 --> 00:32:52.040
 But there are lots of theories about why.

00:32:52.040 --> 00:32:55.200
 My favorite theory is that they flap their arms

00:32:55.200 --> 00:32:58.760
 for six hours a day, which is incredible aerobic exercise.

00:32:58.760 --> 00:33:02.240
 Because they've just got incredible upper body exercise.

00:33:02.240 --> 00:33:03.800
 Andy's doing an impression right now.

00:33:03.800 --> 00:33:05.320
 - Low blood pressure.

00:33:05.320 --> 00:33:07.280
 They're listening to beautiful music all day.

00:33:07.280 --> 00:33:08.360
 But it may, like I say,

00:33:08.360 --> 00:33:09.800
 it may be that we just noticed the long-lived ones.

00:33:09.800 --> 00:33:12.920
 'Cause some conductors actually died while conducting.

00:33:12.920 --> 00:33:14.280
 - Oh. - Which is very sad.

00:33:14.280 --> 00:33:16.920
 You know, there was a guy called Giuseppe Sinopoli

00:33:16.920 --> 00:33:20.080
 who died in 2001 while conducting an orchestra.

00:33:20.080 --> 00:33:22.600
 - Struck by lightning. - You can see it though.

00:33:22.600 --> 00:33:23.880
 It's very vigorous pursuit.

00:33:23.880 --> 00:33:26.080
 It's a little bit like Tommy Cooper dying on stage.

00:33:26.080 --> 00:33:27.680
 It's not actually that surprising

00:33:27.680 --> 00:33:30.640
 because it's such a vigorous act you're doing,

00:33:30.640 --> 00:33:33.280
 jumping up and down, bopping around, very stressed on.

00:33:33.280 --> 00:33:34.880
 Whenever you see a conductor, you think,

00:33:34.880 --> 00:33:37.840
 you're moving your body much more than is necessary.

00:33:37.840 --> 00:33:39.640
 And so, no wonder.

00:33:39.640 --> 00:33:41.880
 - There was someone who stabbed his own foot,

00:33:41.880 --> 00:33:43.840
 wasn't there, I can't remember who that was.

00:33:43.840 --> 00:33:44.680
 It was a famous one.

00:33:44.680 --> 00:33:45.840
 - Lili, Jean-Baptiste Lili.

00:33:45.840 --> 00:33:46.880
 - Lili, that's right, yeah.

00:33:46.880 --> 00:33:48.240
 - Sounds like you're doing it wrong.

00:33:48.240 --> 00:33:49.560
 - It was when they had this big staff

00:33:49.560 --> 00:33:50.640
 and he was beating time.

00:33:50.640 --> 00:33:52.120
 And it was a six foot staff you would use.

00:33:52.120 --> 00:33:54.040
 They hadn't rationalized it down to the baton.

00:33:54.040 --> 00:33:55.360
 It was very much like the old mobile phones

00:33:55.360 --> 00:33:56.200
 which were massive bricks.

00:33:56.200 --> 00:33:57.800
 It was like that, but for batons.

00:33:57.800 --> 00:33:59.880
 And he stabbed his foot, he pounded his foot

00:33:59.880 --> 00:34:01.520
 and they got gangried and then he died.

00:34:01.520 --> 00:34:02.360
 - Oh no.

00:34:02.360 --> 00:34:03.200
 - Yeah.

00:34:03.200 --> 00:34:05.360
 - It was the Gandalf to the Harry Potter wand of conducting.

00:34:05.360 --> 00:34:06.200
 That's very cool.

00:34:06.200 --> 00:34:07.040
 - Yeah, exactly.

00:34:07.040 --> 00:34:08.680
 Exactly, yeah, yeah.

00:34:08.680 --> 00:34:10.880
 - She lived quite late.

00:34:10.880 --> 00:34:13.400
 She made it into old age, Ethel.

00:34:13.400 --> 00:34:15.480
 And what's interesting is when I said earlier

00:34:15.480 --> 00:34:16.920
 that she got a Grammy,

00:34:16.920 --> 00:34:19.360
 the piece that she got it for, this 1930 opera,

00:34:19.360 --> 00:34:22.240
 she was 72 years old when she finished composing that.

00:34:22.240 --> 00:34:25.040
 Which is quite a late in the day composition

00:34:25.040 --> 00:34:29.120
 for any artist to then be given an award for, I would say.

00:34:29.120 --> 00:34:31.240
 Especially since she was deaf.

00:34:31.240 --> 00:34:33.120
 Very sad, she went deaf in her fifties,

00:34:33.120 --> 00:34:35.120
 lost her hearing and I think by the end of her life,

00:34:35.120 --> 00:34:36.640
 which is her eighties, was pretty much deaf.

00:34:36.640 --> 00:34:37.760
 Which is why she started doing things

00:34:37.760 --> 00:34:39.280
 like writing stories about her dogs

00:34:39.280 --> 00:34:42.000
 'cause she found music harder and harder.

00:34:42.000 --> 00:34:43.720
 And she also went out with,

00:34:43.720 --> 00:34:46.280
 it sounds like very high society people

00:34:46.280 --> 00:34:47.600
 from the list of her lovers.

00:34:47.600 --> 00:34:51.000
 There's Pauline Lady Trevelyan, Lady Mary Ponsonby,

00:34:51.000 --> 00:34:52.680
 Violet Gordon Woodhouse,

00:34:52.680 --> 00:34:54.800
 Winaretta Singer of Sewing Machine.

00:34:54.800 --> 00:34:55.640
 - Winaretta?

00:34:55.640 --> 00:34:56.480
 - I say no.

00:34:56.480 --> 00:34:57.320
 - Wow.

00:34:57.320 --> 00:34:59.720
 - The singer, Empress Eugenie.

00:34:59.720 --> 00:35:00.560
 - What?

00:35:00.560 --> 00:35:01.720
 - Yeah, quite a high class name there, yeah.

00:35:01.720 --> 00:35:03.280
 (laughing)

00:35:03.280 --> 00:35:05.480
 I read, so she had a friend who,

00:35:05.480 --> 00:35:06.840
 there was only one man she ever had an affair with

00:35:06.840 --> 00:35:08.200
 who was called Henry Brewster.

00:35:08.200 --> 00:35:10.840
 But then she also had an affair with Brewster's wife.

00:35:10.840 --> 00:35:11.680
 - Yes.

00:35:11.680 --> 00:35:13.760
 - And with Brewster's wife's sister.

00:35:13.760 --> 00:35:16.160
 - Which Brewster was fine with

00:35:16.160 --> 00:35:18.080
 and encouraged it seems like.

00:35:18.080 --> 00:35:19.120
 He was very tolerant.

00:35:19.120 --> 00:35:22.920
 - That is a very open-minded way of thinking about it.

00:35:22.920 --> 00:35:24.920
 - He seems like a really great guy, Brewster,

00:35:24.920 --> 00:35:25.760
 like the real tolerant.

00:35:25.760 --> 00:35:26.800
 - What did he do, who was he?

00:35:26.800 --> 00:35:28.920
 - He was basically her librettist,

00:35:28.920 --> 00:35:30.840
 so he wrote the lyrics to a lot of her operas

00:35:30.840 --> 00:35:32.920
 and they were really close friends.

00:35:32.920 --> 00:35:35.080
 - Does all this not make you think that perhaps

00:35:35.080 --> 00:35:39.400
 a spurned lover or perhaps the partner of a spurned lover

00:35:39.400 --> 00:35:41.200
 was the one who tied her to a tree?

00:35:41.200 --> 00:35:42.960
 (laughing)

00:35:42.960 --> 00:35:43.800
 Does seem that way.

00:35:43.800 --> 00:35:45.680
 - He's fine with it, he encourages my habits.

00:35:45.680 --> 00:35:47.360
 Yes, I have been here for four days.

00:35:47.360 --> 00:35:48.680
 (laughing)

00:35:48.680 --> 00:35:49.800
 - What would you rather not have?

00:35:49.800 --> 00:35:51.840
 Your big toe or your big thumb?

00:35:51.840 --> 00:35:52.680
 - A big toe.

00:35:52.680 --> 00:35:53.520
 - Yeah.

00:35:53.520 --> 00:35:54.340
 - But don't you lose or balance?

00:35:54.340 --> 00:35:56.360
 I guess you'd have an artificial toe put in its place.

00:35:56.360 --> 00:35:58.440
 - Well, what they do is they,

00:35:58.440 --> 00:36:00.200
 so you've moved your big toe to your thumb,

00:36:00.200 --> 00:36:02.840
 they move your other big toe to your other big toe,

00:36:02.840 --> 00:36:04.400
 and then they move your other thumb

00:36:04.400 --> 00:36:05.520
 to replace that big toe.

00:36:05.520 --> 00:36:06.360
 - Yes.

00:36:06.360 --> 00:36:08.240
 - And then they move your ear to replace the thumb.

00:36:08.240 --> 00:36:09.080
 - Yep.

00:36:09.080 --> 00:36:10.080
 - It's like a Rubik's Cube, isn't it?

00:36:10.080 --> 00:36:13.040
 Very frustrating, you can never line it all up.

00:36:13.040 --> 00:36:16.040
 - Maybe this is who Pablo Picasso was painting all this time.

00:36:16.040 --> 00:36:17.680
 (laughing)

00:36:17.680 --> 00:36:18.960
 - You know, we know the creator of Bing.

00:36:18.960 --> 00:36:21.200
 - Oh, fucking hell, do I know him?

00:36:21.200 --> 00:36:23.080
 - Yeah, do you remember in QI,

00:36:23.080 --> 00:36:26.000
 there was a guy called, he was an American inventor.

00:36:26.000 --> 00:36:27.240
 He was so cool.

00:36:27.240 --> 00:36:29.440
 Ted Dewan, he was...

00:36:29.440 --> 00:36:31.320
 - I do know him, 'cause I've seen the name

00:36:31.320 --> 00:36:32.760
 and I'm like, that name was, yeah, Ted Dewan.

00:36:32.760 --> 00:36:34.240
 - Yeah, yeah, he was always at the QI club.

00:36:34.240 --> 00:36:35.080
 He was a member.

00:36:35.080 --> 00:36:35.920
 - I hate that shit.

00:36:35.920 --> 00:36:39.840
 I was like, oh, I got so sick and then, oh my God.

00:36:39.840 --> 00:36:41.680
 - Check this out.

00:36:41.680 --> 00:36:43.960
 Just very quickly, I'm sorry, but just very quickly.

00:36:43.960 --> 00:36:46.040
 So R of Street has this WhatsApp group,

00:36:46.040 --> 00:36:47.440
 which I've recently joined.

00:36:47.440 --> 00:36:48.720
 And there's a lady on it who said,

00:36:48.720 --> 00:36:50.200
 "Does anyone have a cassette player?"

00:36:50.200 --> 00:36:51.680
 I've recently found an old cassette,

00:36:51.680 --> 00:36:52.640
 which is 26 years old,

00:36:52.640 --> 00:36:54.480
 from a medium reading that I had.

00:36:54.480 --> 00:36:56.840
 And I want to see how much of what she said is true.

00:36:56.840 --> 00:36:58.040
 So I got very excited.

00:36:58.040 --> 00:37:00.800
 I was like, yes, I totally want to get you.

00:37:00.800 --> 00:37:01.720
 So I lied and said, yeah,

00:37:01.720 --> 00:37:03.840
 I've got a cassette player converter thing.

00:37:03.840 --> 00:37:06.520
 And so I'm hopefully going to meet up with her to hear it

00:37:06.520 --> 00:37:07.840
 and see what... - Have you bought a cassette?

00:37:07.840 --> 00:37:09.920
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah, just to, yeah, it's amazing.

00:37:09.920 --> 00:37:10.760
 - You have to be free.

00:37:10.760 --> 00:37:11.600
 - What? Check this out.

00:37:11.600 --> 00:37:15.120
 I was looking her name on the WhatsApp thing.

00:37:15.120 --> 00:37:16.240
 She's called Joe Clegg.

00:37:16.240 --> 00:37:18.680
 And I was like, God, that name just sounds so familiar.

00:37:18.680 --> 00:37:20.680
 And her photo looked a bit professionally taken.

00:37:20.680 --> 00:37:22.320
 So I thought, ooh, okay, maybe she is someone.

00:37:22.320 --> 00:37:24.280
 So I Googled her and it turns out

00:37:24.280 --> 00:37:27.160
 she's written 19 episodes of "Hey, Duggy".

00:37:27.160 --> 00:37:28.200
 (laughing)

00:37:28.200 --> 00:37:30.000
 Yeah, on my street.

00:37:30.000 --> 00:37:32.040
 She writes "Go Jedders" and "Hey, Duggy".

00:37:32.040 --> 00:37:33.200
 - Oh my God.

00:37:33.200 --> 00:37:36.080
 I love it if you just turn on the cassette

00:37:36.080 --> 00:37:38.560
 and it just goes, ah, woof, yeah, woof, woof.

00:37:38.560 --> 00:37:40.200
 (laughing)

00:37:40.200 --> 00:37:42.360
 - Hey, Duggy's actually been predicting the apocalypse

00:37:42.360 --> 00:37:43.880
 on every single episode.

00:37:43.880 --> 00:37:46.120
 - We can't understand what he says.

00:37:46.120 --> 00:37:46.960
 - I should do that.

00:37:46.960 --> 00:37:48.200
 That's so funny.

00:37:48.200 --> 00:37:49.040
 - Come on, enough.

00:37:49.040 --> 00:37:49.960
 - Okay, sorry, sorry.

00:37:49.960 --> 00:37:51.040
 - Suburban dad chat.

00:37:51.040 --> 00:37:53.000
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:37:53.000 --> 00:37:54.600
 - So the other thing about Ethel,

00:37:54.600 --> 00:37:56.520
 seeing as we're talking about other composers,

00:37:56.520 --> 00:37:58.560
 she was friends with Tchaikovsky.

00:37:58.560 --> 00:38:01.240
 And Tchaikovsky said of her that Ms. Smithe

00:38:01.240 --> 00:38:03.320
 is one of the few women composers

00:38:03.320 --> 00:38:05.040
 whom one can seriously consider

00:38:05.040 --> 00:38:07.040
 to be achieving something valuable

00:38:07.040 --> 00:38:09.640
 in the field of musical creation.

00:38:09.640 --> 00:38:10.680
 - Great.

00:38:10.680 --> 00:38:13.000
 - Yeah, it's a compliment of sorts.

00:38:13.000 --> 00:38:14.120
 - It is to her.

00:38:14.120 --> 00:38:14.960
 - It is to her.

00:38:14.960 --> 00:38:16.240
 - Did you say one of the few composers

00:38:16.240 --> 00:38:17.640
 or one of the few women composers?

00:38:17.640 --> 00:38:18.720
 - Women composers.

00:38:18.720 --> 00:38:20.040
 - Oh, right, it's less of a compliment.

00:38:20.040 --> 00:38:20.880
 Got it.

00:38:20.880 --> 00:38:21.920
 - No, it's a compliment to her,

00:38:21.920 --> 00:38:25.040
 but not much of a compliment to the rest of womankind.

00:38:25.040 --> 00:38:27.240
 But he does also say that since, of course,

00:38:27.240 --> 00:38:29.920
 no English woman can be without her peculiarities

00:38:29.920 --> 00:38:31.440
 and eccentricities,

00:38:31.440 --> 00:38:34.560
 it is no wonder that Ms. Smithe displaced some two.

00:38:34.560 --> 00:38:36.960
 And he gave three peculiarities.

00:38:36.960 --> 00:38:38.640
 One, that she had a dog,

00:38:38.640 --> 00:38:40.320
 which she was inseparable from.

00:38:40.320 --> 00:38:43.840
 Two, was that she really liked hunting.

00:38:43.840 --> 00:38:46.520
 And three, that she liked Brahms.

00:38:46.520 --> 00:38:49.480
 'Cause Tchaikovsky hated Brahms.

00:38:49.480 --> 00:38:50.960
 He really, really hated him.

00:38:50.960 --> 00:38:52.680
 He thought his music was awful.

00:38:52.680 --> 00:38:55.760
 And when Tchaikovsky and Smithe used to hang out together,

00:38:55.760 --> 00:38:57.240
 they used to have nice conversations.

00:38:57.240 --> 00:38:58.520
 And then every now and then Tchaikovsky

00:38:58.520 --> 00:39:01.000
 would go over to the piano, play some Brahms,

00:39:01.000 --> 00:39:03.520
 and go, he can't seriously like this.

00:39:03.520 --> 00:39:04.360
 - Really?

00:39:04.360 --> 00:39:05.200
 - This is awful.

00:39:05.200 --> 00:39:06.360
 This is terrible.

00:39:06.360 --> 00:39:08.440
 And that was the only thing they disagreed about

00:39:08.440 --> 00:39:10.000
 was how good Brahms was.

00:39:10.000 --> 00:39:11.320
 - She's over here tied to a tree.

00:39:11.320 --> 00:39:14.320
 You can't think of any other peculiarities about me at all.

00:39:14.320 --> 00:39:16.360
 No, that's it, Brahms, that's it.

00:39:16.360 --> 00:39:19.200
 - But then a bit later, Tchaikovsky was invited

00:39:19.200 --> 00:39:21.640
 to a dinner at which Brahms was.

00:39:21.640 --> 00:39:25.080
 And he said he was a very nice person and stuff.

00:39:25.080 --> 00:39:28.320
 And he wrote to Smithe and said,

00:39:28.320 --> 00:39:30.880
 "In Hamburg, I spent a whole day in the company

00:39:30.880 --> 00:39:34.520
 "of your idol, Johannes Brahms."

00:39:34.520 --> 00:39:37.400
 So it was like the one thing that he wanted to say to her

00:39:37.400 --> 00:39:40.600
 was that, you know, he'd been to this guy

00:39:40.600 --> 00:39:42.920
 who he thought was terrible, but she liked.

00:39:42.920 --> 00:39:43.760
 - What did he say?

00:39:43.760 --> 00:39:47.160
 And in conclusion, he was a nice man, but still shit.

00:39:47.160 --> 00:39:48.000
 - Pretty much.

00:39:48.000 --> 00:39:51.280
 The exact words were, "He is a very agreeable man,

00:39:51.280 --> 00:39:53.080
 "even though my appreciation of his talent

00:39:53.080 --> 00:39:55.040
 "does not quite tally with yours."

00:39:55.040 --> 00:39:57.000
 - Well, I'm gonna come out and say it, Tchaikovsky.

00:39:57.000 --> 00:39:59.240
 I think Brahms is a lot better than you are, so.

00:39:59.240 --> 00:40:00.080
 - Than Tchaikovsky?

00:40:00.080 --> 00:40:01.520
 - Yeah, what are you gonna do about that?

00:40:01.520 --> 00:40:02.840
 Nothing, are you?

00:40:02.840 --> 00:40:04.920
 - There's a kind of sort of always meet your villains thing,

00:40:04.920 --> 00:40:05.760
 isn't there?

00:40:05.760 --> 00:40:06.600
 - Yeah.

00:40:06.600 --> 00:40:08.440
 - As in the best case scenario, you think they're nice.

00:40:08.440 --> 00:40:10.440
 Or worst case scenario, you get fuel

00:40:10.440 --> 00:40:13.360
 for your irrational hatred of them.

00:40:13.360 --> 00:40:15.480
 - Who's would yours be?

00:40:15.480 --> 00:40:16.480
 - My villain.

00:40:16.480 --> 00:40:17.920
 - Yeah, who's your villain?

00:40:17.920 --> 00:40:20.880
 - Can we say on this?

00:40:20.880 --> 00:40:22.440
 - Depends, is it Dan?

00:40:22.440 --> 00:40:24.160
 (laughing)

00:40:24.160 --> 00:40:26.160
 - I sort of don't want to slag off other people

00:40:26.160 --> 00:40:28.000
 in the same line of work as us.

00:40:28.000 --> 00:40:28.840
 - Yeah.

00:40:28.840 --> 00:40:29.680
 - Okay, that's tricky.

00:40:29.680 --> 00:40:30.520
 - Oh, right, no, you should have just gone

00:40:30.520 --> 00:40:32.400
 for a historical character or a cartoon character

00:40:32.400 --> 00:40:33.240
 or something, keep it safe.

00:40:33.240 --> 00:40:35.000
 - Well, my dad wrote a porno, don't do this anymore.

00:40:35.000 --> 00:40:37.920
 - Oh yeah, my dad wrote a porno, great, yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:40:37.920 --> 00:40:39.440
 - Ooh, Jamie's not gonna like that.

00:40:39.440 --> 00:40:41.600
 (laughing)

00:40:41.600 --> 00:40:43.280
 - Guys, do you remember Jeremy?

00:40:43.280 --> 00:40:44.880
 - Yeah, of course, yes.

00:40:44.880 --> 00:40:49.600
 - He was on "No Such Thing as the News" guest star.

00:40:49.600 --> 00:40:50.440
 - He was a snail.

00:40:50.440 --> 00:40:52.680
 - He was a snail, he was a left-handed snail

00:40:52.680 --> 00:40:54.760
 and they're very rare left-handed snails

00:40:54.760 --> 00:40:56.640
 as we discussed on that show,

00:40:56.640 --> 00:40:58.720
 so they can't mate with any other snails

00:40:58.720 --> 00:40:59.800
 that aren't left-handed

00:40:59.800 --> 00:41:01.840
 and since they're very hard for them to mate,

00:41:01.840 --> 00:41:03.640
 it's 'cause of the way that they're oriented,

00:41:03.640 --> 00:41:06.160
 their genital organs don't match up.

00:41:06.160 --> 00:41:09.360
 But since then, he sadly died in 2017.

00:41:09.360 --> 00:41:11.040
 I believe they did find him a mate in the end,

00:41:11.040 --> 00:41:11.880
 but since then-- - Lasted longer

00:41:11.880 --> 00:41:12.880
 than our TV show.

00:41:12.880 --> 00:41:14.480
 (laughing)

00:41:14.480 --> 00:41:16.080
 - He was constantly recommissioned.

00:41:16.080 --> 00:41:17.440
 (laughing)

00:41:17.440 --> 00:41:18.360
 It's pretty dull, actually,

00:41:18.360 --> 00:41:20.320
 after a while, the Jeremy show,

00:41:20.320 --> 00:41:24.600
 but we now have a way of making him a mate,

00:41:24.600 --> 00:41:27.160
 so you can edit the genes of snails

00:41:27.160 --> 00:41:29.320
 using CRISPR gene editing.

00:41:29.320 --> 00:41:32.360
 The famous always talked about gene editing

00:41:32.360 --> 00:41:34.680
 and when they're eggs,

00:41:34.680 --> 00:41:37.200
 you can inject it with something

00:41:37.200 --> 00:41:38.200
 that tampers with its genes

00:41:38.200 --> 00:41:39.280
 and turns it into a lefty.

00:41:39.280 --> 00:41:40.120
 - That was incredible.

00:41:40.120 --> 00:41:40.960
 - That is really good.

00:41:40.960 --> 00:41:42.040
 - I only laughed there, I'm sorry, Anna,

00:41:42.040 --> 00:41:43.800
 but I laughed because when you said

00:41:43.800 --> 00:41:46.080
 we can now make him a mate,

00:41:46.080 --> 00:41:47.720
 I thought the answer was going to be

00:41:47.720 --> 00:41:49.760
 another new technology, 3D printing.

00:41:49.760 --> 00:41:51.280
 - Oh yeah. - And you print a shell

00:41:51.280 --> 00:41:54.160
 and then you just sort of ram the snail into that.

00:41:54.160 --> 00:41:55.760
 (laughing)

00:41:55.760 --> 00:41:57.000
 It doesn't work, does it?

00:41:57.000 --> 00:41:58.280
 - No, I don't think that would achieve

00:41:58.280 --> 00:41:59.680
 anything that they wanted to achieve.

00:41:59.680 --> 00:42:02.440
 - 'Cause they grow the shell, it's living.

00:42:02.440 --> 00:42:04.240
 They don't find them, they grow them right here.

00:42:04.240 --> 00:42:06.480
 Yeah, yeah, yeah, that's why it wouldn't work.

00:42:06.480 --> 00:42:07.560
 One of the reasons.

00:42:07.560 --> 00:42:08.400
 - Yeah.

00:42:08.400 --> 00:42:09.800
 - Yeah, yeah.

00:42:09.800 --> 00:42:11.880
 - Just on Monopoly really quickly,

00:42:11.880 --> 00:42:14.560
 the World Championships of Monopoly,

00:42:14.560 --> 00:42:16.360
 the last World Championships,

00:42:16.360 --> 00:42:19.360
 won by a guy called Nicolo Falcone.

00:42:19.360 --> 00:42:22.240
 How long do you reckon the World Championship game

00:42:22.240 --> 00:42:24.000
 lasted of Monopoly?

00:42:24.000 --> 00:42:26.800
 - Oh, more than 12 hours.

00:42:26.800 --> 00:42:28.360
 - An hour and a half before someone

00:42:28.360 --> 00:42:30.240
 just overturned it, right?

00:42:30.240 --> 00:42:31.360
 He used the banker of cheating.

00:42:31.360 --> 00:42:32.200
 - Four minutes.

00:42:32.200 --> 00:42:34.040
 - It was 47 minutes.

00:42:34.040 --> 00:42:34.880
 - Ah, nice.

00:42:34.880 --> 00:42:36.120
 - But that's quite short, isn't it?

00:42:36.120 --> 00:42:36.960
 - Yeah.

00:42:36.960 --> 00:42:39.240
 - And apparently Nicolo Falcone said

00:42:39.240 --> 00:42:41.080
 that if you know the rules,

00:42:41.080 --> 00:42:42.640
 it shouldn't last so long.

00:42:42.640 --> 00:42:44.880
 Like, for instance, you can buy houses

00:42:44.880 --> 00:42:47.120
 when it's other people's turns.

00:42:47.120 --> 00:42:49.200
 You know, if you actually read the rules

00:42:49.200 --> 00:42:51.800
 and don't play it in the way that everyone plays it,

00:42:51.800 --> 00:42:52.960
 then it's actually not that long again.

00:42:52.960 --> 00:42:55.120
 - I read that you could win it in four moves

00:42:55.120 --> 00:42:56.640
 if you knew the rules inside out.

00:42:56.640 --> 00:42:57.480
 - And you were playing so much.

00:42:57.480 --> 00:42:58.320
 No, but that's it.

00:42:58.320 --> 00:43:00.560
 (laughing)

00:43:00.560 --> 00:43:02.600
 - Sorry.

00:43:02.600 --> 00:43:05.200
 - Dan, can I be the knight?

00:43:05.200 --> 00:43:07.520
 - Wait, I keep trying to buy people's bishops.

00:43:07.520 --> 00:43:10.100
 (upbeat music)

00:43:10.100 --> 00:43:15.200
 - And here we are on the other side.

00:43:15.200 --> 00:43:16.040
 That is it.

00:43:16.040 --> 00:43:17.640
 That is all of our bonus bits.

00:43:17.640 --> 00:43:19.720
 If you'd like to get in contact with any of us

00:43:19.720 --> 00:43:20.920
 about the things that have been said

00:43:20.920 --> 00:43:22.640
 over the course of this compilation,

00:43:22.640 --> 00:43:24.360
 we can all be found on our Twitter accounts.

00:43:24.360 --> 00:43:27.760
 I'm on @Sriberland, James is on @JamesHarken,

00:43:27.760 --> 00:43:32.080
 and Andy is on @AndrewHunterM.

00:43:32.080 --> 00:43:34.240
 Anna is, of course, away on maternity now,

00:43:34.240 --> 00:43:36.120
 but if you'd like to write to the four of us,

00:43:36.120 --> 00:43:40.180
 you can get to us on podcast@QI.com.

00:43:40.180 --> 00:43:43.080
 Okay, Club Fishers, that's it for now.

00:43:43.080 --> 00:43:45.440
 We'll see you again next time with another compilation.

00:43:45.440 --> 00:43:46.780
 Goodbye.

00:43:46.780 --> 00:43:49.360
 (upbeat music)

00:43:49.360 --> 00:43:51.940
 (upbeat music)

00:43:51.940 --> 00:43:54.520
 (upbeat music)

00:43:54.520 --> 00:43:57.100
 (upbeat music)

00:43:57.100 --> 00:43:59.680
 (upbeat music)
