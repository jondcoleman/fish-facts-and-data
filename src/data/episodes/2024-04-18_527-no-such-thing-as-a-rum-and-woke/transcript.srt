00:00:00,960 --> 00:00:06,840
 Hi everyone, welcome to this week's episode of no such thing as a fish where we were joined by the incredible

2
00:00:06,840 --> 00:00:09,020
 Doctor Erica

3
00:00:09,020 --> 00:00:13,800
 McAllister now Erica has been on the podcast before so you might remember her

4
00:00:13,800 --> 00:00:19,560
 But if you don't the one thing you need to know is that she is an expert in flies

5
00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:25,700
 Insects, I won't say creepy Carly's I won't say mini beast because I know Erica doesn't like that

6
00:00:25,700 --> 00:00:33,520
 But she is essentially a senior curator at the Natural History Museum and an absolute legend in this office

7
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:39,100
 She is so enthusiastic about her subject, but also so funny so interesting

8
00:00:39,100 --> 00:00:45,080
 We really really enjoyed making this show and the main thing I do need to tell you is that Erica has a book out

9
00:00:45,080 --> 00:00:50,600
 Her book is called metamorphosis how insects are changing our world

10
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:53,800
 It's a lovely thing. I've got a copy of it right here

11
00:00:53,800 --> 00:00:56,740
 It's got loads of amazing pictures incredible stories

12
00:00:56,740 --> 00:01:02,040
 It's just a really really great object to own and obviously you'll learn a great deal about

13
00:01:02,040 --> 00:01:10,320
 Insects if you buy that book another thing to say is that the radio for show which spawned the book get it spawned

14
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:18,640
 It's called metamorphosis how insects transformed our world that is currently available on BBC radio for if you Google radio for

15
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:24,720
 Erica McAllister you will find it. It's a great show, and it is full of amazing facts anyway

16
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:30,800
 Not much more to add join Club Fish if you haven't buy our books if you haven't blah blah blah blah blah

17
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:35,520
 Let's get on with the show with dr. Erica McAllister and on with the podcast

18
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:55,160
 Hello and welcome to another episode of no subs thing as a fish a weekly podcast coming to you from the QI offices in Hoban

19
00:01:55,160 --> 00:02:00,040
 My name is Andrew Hunter Murray, and I'm here with Anna Tajinsky James Harkin and Erica McAllister

20
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:04,560
 And once again we have gathered around the microphones with our four favorite facts from the last seven days

21
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:09,480
 So in no particular order here. We go starting with fact number one, and that is Erica

22
00:02:09,480 --> 00:02:12,600
 Some flies have tits on the inside

23
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:19,800
 It's on the inside. Yeah, I mean do they have to wear bras on the

24
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:23,640
 Yeah, how do you type because it was tough enough to do off on the outside?

25
00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:28,680
 Actually, I just think it's an evolutionary advantage of them avoiding males groping them in public

26
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:32,280
 Suddenly you think male flies are gropers. Oh, look at how many hands they have

27
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:41,000
 So it's it's okay take your head away from imagining loads of little mammary grounds on the inside

28
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:46,200
 But it's they have this kind of flat surface, and they've got no nipples. So it's it's like a big area

29
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:49,480
 But they do you give birth to live young?

30
00:02:49,480 --> 00:02:55,160
 So they will instead of like shooting off hundreds of thousands of eggs. They've decided to actually, do you know what?

31
00:02:55,160 --> 00:02:57,800
 Let's concentrate on raising one larvae

32
00:02:57,800 --> 00:03:03,560
 And this yeah, I know that's unusual in place, right? It's unusual in insects. Ah

33
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:09,000
 So we generally think of the mammals doing that, you know, let's let's actually look after just one and go for it

34
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:12,200
 Now this is in the super family hippo-bossoidia

35
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:17,160
 And they include the things that people would have found on the outside of their bodies

36
00:03:17,160 --> 00:03:20,440
 Yeah, and they include the things that people would have heard of like tetsi

37
00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:25,880
 Um tetsi flies is no because tetsi means fly. Mm-hmm. It's another little fact

38
00:03:25,880 --> 00:03:31,880
 And what is amazing like the tetsi when she gets pregnant because she probably does get pregnant

39
00:03:31,880 --> 00:03:35,960
 The larvae when it's born can have a mass bigger than her

40
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:40,360
 Oh, oh, yeah, I've seen a video of them giving birth

41
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:46,760
 And it is remarkable because imagine having a baby and it's bigger than you first of all

42
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
 It seems impossible

43
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:53,720
 How do they what do they then shrink as they get older? Otherwise, they just get bigger and bigger and bigger

44
00:03:53,720 --> 00:03:55,720
 They go through metamorphosis, remember?

45
00:03:55,720 --> 00:04:01,400
 I forgot that it's not a video that they show fly nct because I like that idea

46
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:08,760
 This is just to get you ready now if you light a lot of candles and play some nice music it won't be as bad as you think

47
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:10,760
 But I mean

48
00:04:10,760 --> 00:04:15,560
 Do you look at her stomach before she gives birth her abdomen just looks like the radicchio cabbage?

49
00:04:15,960 --> 00:04:18,980
 You know, it's really it's properly swell. It is absolutely

50
00:04:18,980 --> 00:04:26,840
 Engorged it's red. It's got these white veins all over it. It's just I mean, she only gives birth about three or four times

51
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:33,400
 I mean only is quite something I know. I think I would have given up after one. Yeah. Yeah. We're actually just going to say one and done

52
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:39,640
 We've made a decision it's easy with the schools also. What a great way of putting me off a radicchio cabbage for

53
00:04:39,640 --> 00:04:41,480
 sorry

54
00:04:41,480 --> 00:04:44,760
 so one thing I read about the specifically the tetsi flies is that

55
00:04:45,320 --> 00:04:50,040
 The females get a lifetime's worth of sperm from mating once

56
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:54,360
 And then they just use it bit by bit as they go they kind of hoard it

57
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:58,760
 I suppose if you only have one child a lifetime supply of sperm is just one sperm

58
00:04:58,760 --> 00:05:04,840
 So so many insects do this and a lot of flies it's called a spermotheca and it's where they store sperm

59
00:05:04,840 --> 00:05:09,160
 They can get rid of sperm. They can replace sperm now. This might be a question that you can't answer

60
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:11,160
 But I was really wondering this when reading about it

61
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:16,760
 Um a really sad because presumably every shag is a one-night stand. So a bit of a shame there

62
00:05:16,760 --> 00:05:21,160
 Um, yeah, but it's like in some of them only live for hours. There's not even like a night

63
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:23,320
 Okay, fair enough for one minute stand

64
00:05:23,320 --> 00:05:26,920
 Um, but then when you've got all this sperm inside you you want to pick the best one

65
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:32,200
 Do you know how like? Yeah, what's the mechanism where you've got sperm within you? No idea

66
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:33,560
 No, no

67
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:37,080
 You're beginning to look at this because you've got this is cryptic female selection going on

68
00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:38,440
 So this is all quite exciting

69
00:05:38,440 --> 00:05:43,800
 So the victorians had this whole thing about oh, it's always about the males the males this the males choose blah blah blah

70
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:48,360
 And it's like, okay back off. We know this is not the case. We can see it in our own sex

71
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:52,120
 So we're looking at the biochemistry now. We're looking at the hormones. We're looking at that

72
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:57,400
 So her body is trying to kill sperm. His sperm is trying to drug her

73
00:05:57,400 --> 00:06:02,840
 It's all sorts of things going on. Why is her body trying to kill because her body wants the best

74
00:06:02,840 --> 00:06:06,600
 So she kills off all the weaklings only the best kids. How does she die?

75
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:10,040
 We don't know. What was the other thing about them poisoning?

76
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:12,680
 Oh, yeah, the males drug the females

77
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:17,880
 Yeah, so his sperm is going to have a load of pheromones in loads of different chemicals

78
00:06:17,880 --> 00:06:24,200
 And so with Drosophila, we know that immediately they've had sex the sperm makes the female less likely to have sex again

79
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:28,520
 So they are trying there's lots of sneaky behavior going on

80
00:06:28,520 --> 00:06:35,400
 Some of these flies they said the bat flies which I really love so I spend a lot of time running after bats in the Caribbean

81
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:37,560
 She's nice

82
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:42,520
 The female when she gets pregnant some of them undertake some extreme morphological adaptations at this point

83
00:06:42,520 --> 00:06:47,240
 So there's one that when she gets pregnant she rips her legs off and she rips her wings off

84
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:52,600
 And then she sticks her head into the back and basically most of her body she undergoes

85
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:57,000
 This complete metamorphosis. What does she rip off her last two legs with?

86
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:00,840
 Well, she's still I guess she's like she's sort of ripped her wings off first

87
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:03,320
 She's learned that the legs they can break them

88
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:08,360
 So I presume she's breaking them off but mother nature's sort of a lovely solution

89
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:12,840
 So she can stick her head in but she invaginates herself like she kind of I beg your pardon

90
00:07:12,840 --> 00:07:15,080
 She kind of wrapped her abdomen

91
00:07:15,080 --> 00:07:18,440
 Invaginates, she kind of goes like I've invaginated meaning sheaf

92
00:07:18,440 --> 00:07:22,840
 So she kind of like draws herself into her own body like pulling herself into a sleeping bag

93
00:07:22,840 --> 00:07:27,240
 Yeah, well what a chat up line. I've never got a fanciest spot of invagination

94
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:30,680
 I think that rides yourself out of the picture in that

95
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:38,760
 You mentioned you were running around chasing bats in Barbados and I've tried to catch two bats in my life inside rooms to get them out

96
00:07:38,760 --> 00:07:40,760
 And it's extremely difficult

97
00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:46,440
 How do you what are you doing just leaping along beach luxury beaches after bats in the dark?

98
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:50,680
 No, no, it was in Dominica and we have uh mist nets

99
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:56,840
 So have you ever seen uh mist nets catching birds? No, obviously you lot have never done holidays like I do

100
00:07:57,800 --> 00:08:03,960
 So you've ever been this net and a bat comes flying into it and male bats and then really obviously male bats

101
00:08:03,960 --> 00:08:07,000
 These two giant testicles are straight in your face

102
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:10,760
 And you're holding them open because you're you're trying to weigh them sex them

103
00:08:10,760 --> 00:08:15,640
 Speciate them and then I'm the little entomologist next to trying to find these little bat flies

104
00:08:15,640 --> 00:08:18,520
 So they look like little drunk spiders running all over the bats

105
00:08:18,520 --> 00:08:22,040
 So they're visible enough as in you can see them without a whip or a scat they're big enough

106
00:08:22,040 --> 00:08:23,400
 And they're like

107
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:28,680
 They're running around and they annoy the bats because they've got parasites. I don't know because the bat's so angry at this day

108
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:31,800
 I don't know what's annoying. Someone's measuring his testicles

109
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:34,520
 So there's a lot going on

110
00:08:34,520 --> 00:08:39,960
 Sort of parasites the size of your own thumb just running around your body. I'm guessing they're bigger than these things

111
00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:45,240
 Oh great. Okay, fab. There's a whole lot of interesting things. There's a group of flies that are slightly different

112
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:47,640
 These are called bee riders and they hang around honeybees

113
00:08:47,640 --> 00:08:52,040
 They will go down and feed around the mouth of say the queen which they are often on

114
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:56,840
 And these have mimicked her smell. So the queen knows that something

115
00:08:56,840 --> 00:09:01,240
 This is bit running around on her. There's other creature, but it smells like her

116
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:07,720
 So she thinks it's herself. She's like, is that is that me? I don't know, but it literally is imagine your head running around your body

117
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:10,040
 Like going

118
00:09:10,040 --> 00:09:15,640
 Pardon a minute. What is that Anna? Did that answer your question of how to catch a bat? Thank you. Yes

119
00:09:15,640 --> 00:09:22,200
 Sorry, perfect. It would be cool if you if you had a beard which you get crumbs in other beard mites that

120
00:09:22,920 --> 00:09:24,920
 Can eat the food

121
00:09:24,920 --> 00:09:29,640
 Oh, yeah, really get crumbs in your eyelashes. Do you and there's obviously other things?

122
00:09:29,640 --> 00:09:33,720
 Again, you don't get crumbs there either. I think some people get crumbs

123
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:37,960
 I do there's a lot of feasting in bed. Okay

124
00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:44,120
 There's a custard cream down here

125
00:09:44,120 --> 00:09:47,560
 Does this hob not been imaginative?

126
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:53,000
 Sorry. Sorry. Sorry. Let's talk about flies

127
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:57,320
 A negative about flies because I know you're a fan, but tetsy flies

128
00:09:57,320 --> 00:10:03,960
 Are quite big disease spreaders and it's well, you're making a you're making a face like maybe they're not well

129
00:10:03,960 --> 00:10:08,760
 I mean, it's it's not the tetsy's fault again. It's the same. Well, no, it's not because they are vectors

130
00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:10,920
 They're being manipulated by this trapanosome

131
00:10:10,920 --> 00:10:17,800
 Again, and they are their behavior is altered if they have this within them if they have the trapanosome is a parasite

132
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:24,200
 Yeah, so it causes them to go into environments and you know and feed for longer feed earlier and do all of this

133
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:26,840
 So there is manipulation going on with the parasite

134
00:10:26,840 --> 00:10:35,000
 Of course, it's not the parasite's fault either. You're always advocating for the poor flies. Those poor tetsy flies killing millions and millions of people

135
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,640
 Well, I know and I'm not I'm not taken away from that

136
00:10:37,640 --> 00:10:42,280
 But also there has been a case that tetsy has helped massively with conservation

137
00:10:42,280 --> 00:10:47,400
 Because we couldn't go into certain areas. We couldn't take livestock in certain areas

138
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:49,080
 We left all of it

139
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:55,320
 So some of the original national parks in southern Africa were set up because it was like there's nothing we could do with the land

140
00:10:55,320 --> 00:11:01,000
 The indigenous animals were fine because they're like they've got you know skin so thick the tetsy's were

141
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:07,720
 Not doing that. So yes, so there is a case of tetsy. It's very nice. Um, here's an attempt to deal with tetsy flies

142
00:11:07,720 --> 00:11:10,840
 This is quite a clever one. It's what Zimbabwe did in the 1980s. I didn't know this

143
00:11:10,840 --> 00:11:13,880
 There are 60,000 fake cows across Zimbabwe

144
00:11:13,880 --> 00:11:15,960
 which

145
00:11:15,960 --> 00:11:18,760
 You can't tell you can't tell really. I bet I could

146
00:11:18,760 --> 00:11:24,840
 Depends on how destined you are. Is it like where they take one of those mobile phone masks and try and make it look like a tree?

147
00:11:24,840 --> 00:11:27,400
 It's exactly like that. And actually it just looks like a green mobile phone mask

148
00:11:27,400 --> 00:11:32,360
 It's exactly that except you're trying to lure people into the mobile phone mask to give them a shock to blast

149
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:35,800
 Basically, they have these kaira moons. I hope I'm pronouncing all right

150
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:40,360
 These are chemicals that tetsy flies love and they lure them in and then they kill them with insecticide because the cow

151
00:11:40,360 --> 00:11:43,960
 These fake cows also ooze insecticide in some way that I don't fully understand

152
00:11:44,440 --> 00:11:47,480
 Um, but they brought cases down to almost zero in Zimbabwe

153
00:11:47,480 --> 00:11:53,480
 So we we we tether cows often um and put nets over them too because they are really good lures

154
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:58,200
 And and so we yeah, so there's various different, um sampling methods using that

155
00:11:58,200 --> 00:12:02,760
 They've done this with rabbits chickens all sorts put them in boxes chickens head poking out

156
00:12:02,760 --> 00:12:05,400
 Yeah

157
00:12:05,400 --> 00:12:07,960
 Human bait, which is another way we do it

158
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:11,640
 Have you stood in the middle of a net with arms out?

159
00:12:12,280 --> 00:12:16,520
 People I know have really and so yeah, so it's human bait. So every every hour

160
00:12:16,520 --> 00:12:20,280
 They will stick their hand out and let all the mosquitoes feed on them. Oh, yeah

161
00:12:20,280 --> 00:12:24,920
 They would do this. Can I ask Erica? Um, I'm one of the people who when I go on holiday

162
00:12:24,920 --> 00:12:28,360
 I get bitten really really badly and my wife doesn't so

163
00:12:28,360 --> 00:12:35,160
 These people who are the human baits. Do you look for people like me to do it as in are you looking for people?

164
00:12:35,160 --> 00:12:39,560
 Who are just people who would taste it? No, I think we just ask and hope that someone does it

165
00:12:39,880 --> 00:12:41,880
 Right

166
00:12:41,880 --> 00:12:45,400
 Someone to lure in the incredibly rare north african penis bite who flies

167
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:50,280
 Funny you should say that

168
00:12:50,280 --> 00:12:55,880
 So there's new world screw worm they all it was awful this guy went to venezuela to visit his family there

169
00:12:55,880 --> 00:13:00,520
 And he got back to the got back to the uk. This is a horrible story. Do you want me to carry on please?

170
00:13:00,520 --> 00:13:05,480
 Okay, it's our favorite kind. Okay got back to the uk and it's obviously moaning and new world screw worm

171
00:13:05,560 --> 00:13:11,560
 You can have multiple infestation of the maggots. Okay. And is that a screw worm because it screws its way into your body?

172
00:13:11,560 --> 00:13:13,640
 Um, yeah

173
00:13:13,640 --> 00:13:19,480
 His screw infestation of which he had multiple was in his scrotum. Oh, no

174
00:13:19,480 --> 00:13:22,440
 Now he's led this

175
00:13:22,440 --> 00:13:25,800
 Fester as it were for a couple of weeks

176
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:32,120
 Now at this point these maggots you're busy. You can't get a gp's appointment. No, that's saying. Can you do three in the afternoon?

177
00:13:32,360 --> 00:13:34,360
 It might sort itself out

178
00:13:34,360 --> 00:13:37,480
 Well, they eventually will because they were popped out by themselves

179
00:13:37,480 --> 00:13:41,880
 But you have to put up with a writhing maggot maggot discomfort in your scrotum

180
00:13:41,880 --> 00:13:47,320
 If I googled that and it was like it will eventually cure itself. I can imagine being the kind of person so lazy

181
00:13:47,320 --> 00:13:50,840
 I'd be like, you know, I'll deal with it. I just don't think you would now. I'm not a male

182
00:13:50,840 --> 00:13:54,920
 So I do not have them but I think if my scrotum was moving by itself

183
00:13:54,920 --> 00:14:00,040
 I would be tempted to do something about it. Can I ask question? Did his scrotum still smell like him?

184
00:14:00,360 --> 00:14:02,600
 I did know that was obviously

185
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:06,280
 I don't think that was written in the side

186
00:14:06,280 --> 00:14:11,240
 They do they don't move exactly by themselves, but they're certainly what do you mean?

187
00:14:11,240 --> 00:14:15,480
 They move more than the rest of you if I'm running and then I stop

188
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:18,600
 It keeps running

189
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:24,600
 That's when Andy runs the 100 meters. He actually only runs the 99.98 meters

190
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:27,240
 It's not dead. I get over the line that way. Yeah

191
00:14:28,040 --> 00:14:35,560
 Actually on genitals, can I ask a question about fly genitals generally because I have struggled to find

192
00:14:35,560 --> 00:14:42,760
 The definite answer to this. I was reading an article from new scientists in 1990 about how all flies when they have sex

193
00:14:42,760 --> 00:14:48,040
 Their penises the male flies their penises rotate either 180 or 360 not all of them

194
00:14:48,040 --> 00:14:51,480
 Okay, but some of them do. Yes. So it sounded very interesting and cool

195
00:14:51,560 --> 00:14:59,640
 So when I rear mosquitoes when the adult males have hatched we leave them for 24 hours because their genitalia has to rotate 360 degrees

196
00:14:59,640 --> 00:15:01,640
 To be in the correct position. Yes. Yeah

197
00:15:01,640 --> 00:15:07,960
 Wait a minute because if it rotates it's not in one it doesn't just do that it moves down around

198
00:15:07,960 --> 00:15:10,120
 It's not like the hand of a clock

199
00:15:10,120 --> 00:15:13,640
 But it does wrap itself internally around their other organs

200
00:15:13,640 --> 00:15:18,520
 I think you know there's a lot of rapids going on but not all of them rotate and you can see this because some of them will

201
00:15:19,240 --> 00:15:26,440
 Copulate in a missionary, you know or doggy style as it were fly style and others a female would drag the male along behind her

202
00:15:26,440 --> 00:15:32,520
 Okay, so that depends on how much genital rotation has gone on but also that's fixed rotation

203
00:15:32,520 --> 00:15:38,120
 There is temporary rotation so they can move their penis into position like during sex

204
00:15:38,120 --> 00:15:41,720
 Yes, I think I'm saying this and what I've really liked is an explanation of maybe why

205
00:15:41,720 --> 00:15:45,720
 It allows you to be a bit more flexible in the same way that a balloon animal

206
00:15:46,120 --> 00:15:52,680
 If you if you've got a little long balloon and then you rotate it 360 like a magician would when he's making it into an animal

207
00:15:52,680 --> 00:15:58,920
 Right, suddenly that you've got strength there in that twist in the middle and you've got flexibility

208
00:15:58,920 --> 00:16:02,360
 I quite like that. No, no, no, no, but this is a runaway evolution

209
00:16:02,360 --> 00:16:08,280
 So there's some flies that have a penis that is just extraordinary. It's like a massive curly whirly and you're like, whoa

210
00:16:08,280 --> 00:16:12,440
 So she's evolving internally. He's trying to do all these crazy stuff

211
00:16:12,680 --> 00:16:16,120
 So her body parts running away from his body parts. I mean basically, yes

212
00:16:16,120 --> 00:16:21,160
 I'm I'm now thinking all the things that I'm I'm off radicchio cabbages

213
00:16:21,160 --> 00:16:24,040
 off curly ways

214
00:16:24,040 --> 00:16:27,560
 Two of my major food groups

215
00:16:27,560 --> 00:16:36,200
 Okay, it's time for fact number two and that is Anna

216
00:16:36,680 --> 00:16:43,960
 My fact this week is that the oldest rum brand in the world was founded by a man named cumberbatch soba

217
00:16:43,960 --> 00:16:46,840
 ironic

218
00:16:46,840 --> 00:16:51,240
 I've never heard cumberbatch as a first name. Sorry to completely distract from the sober element. No

219
00:16:51,240 --> 00:16:55,080
 Cumberbatch was a crucial part of the fact as well me neither. I'll be honest

220
00:16:55,080 --> 00:17:01,240
 I'd never heard of it as a surname until Benedict cumberbatch came along point. Yeah, it is a relatively uncommon name. Yeah

221
00:17:01,240 --> 00:17:06,520
 Yeah, it's a funny word cumberbatch. Um, anyway, this is um, this is mount gay rum

222
00:17:06,920 --> 00:17:10,680
 And it's probably been producing rum since 1663

223
00:17:10,680 --> 00:17:15,560
 It was and I've sort of cheated on this fact because it was originally called mount gilboa

224
00:17:15,560 --> 00:17:19,400
 And then it was taken over by the sober family

225
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:23,560
 And they put someone in charge called a sir john gay

226
00:17:23,560 --> 00:17:28,760
 Alain to manage it and to manage the distillery a gay rum became the biggest rum in the world an amazing business

227
00:17:28,760 --> 00:17:31,080
 And so when sir john died

228
00:17:31,080 --> 00:17:32,280
 um

229
00:17:32,280 --> 00:17:38,040
 John sober's son cumberbatch renamed mount gilboa mount gay and that's what we get mount gay rum

230
00:17:38,040 --> 00:17:43,160
 So he named it. I have seen that mount gay rum for sale and never realized it was the oldest

231
00:17:43,160 --> 00:17:47,800
 That's quite cool. Yeah weird names. A lot of them. There's pussers rum, which I like

232
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:53,880
 And mount gay. They're all sorts of eccentric names. You can get an extraordinary variety of strength in rum

233
00:17:53,880 --> 00:18:00,280
 Didn't realize the strongest rum in the world. I think is one called rude to your parents rum

234
00:18:01,880 --> 00:18:07,560
 It's uh, it's not really an official rum. You can't really get it unless you go deep into jamaica and ask the right people

235
00:18:07,560 --> 00:18:11,640
 But a journalist tracked it down and it's 160 proof. So 80 percent

236
00:18:11,640 --> 00:18:18,600
 Rum john has said he sniffed it and almost passed out. Yeah, can you even I mean, that's what we're preserving insects

237
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:22,200
 Yeah, I mean, this is like, is that really that as well?

238
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:26,600
 I don't think we know where rum comes from for sure the word rum because there was a

239
00:18:26,920 --> 00:18:31,560
 Drink called rumbulian rumbulian, which was made from boiling sugar cane stalks

240
00:18:31,560 --> 00:18:34,280
 Which is the leading theory and that sounds pretty convincing to be honest

241
00:18:34,280 --> 00:18:42,040
 But um, there was also pirate drink called bumbo, which I really like nice. Yeah. Yeah, but definitely came from the caribbean, right?

242
00:18:42,040 --> 00:18:47,960
 Yeah, and it was from sugar plantation owners who had this kind of molasses which was left over

243
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:54,040
 Black sticky stuff and they would add water to it and then leave it for ment and and it became rum

244
00:18:54,360 --> 00:18:56,600
 Yeah, but I read in greg jenis book

245
00:18:56,600 --> 00:19:03,880
 Um, which is a million years in a day that they would add dead animals or human urine

246
00:19:03,880 --> 00:19:11,080
 To their wash so you go to preserve them as erica says was it entomologists to preserve your urine

247
00:19:11,080 --> 00:19:14,040
 Think you're preserving the dead animals, but yeah

248
00:19:14,040 --> 00:19:15,080
 What's that?

249
00:19:15,080 --> 00:19:22,040
 Apparently the idea is that it would stop the enslave people who are working on your plantation from drinking all of your rum

250
00:19:23,160 --> 00:19:25,720
 But you then have to drink dead rat rum. What would it remind me?

251
00:19:25,720 --> 00:19:29,480
 When you're selling it, you don't advertise the fact that there's been dead animals and urine in it

252
00:19:29,480 --> 00:19:35,800
 Or perhaps it was a story that you told the people so that they didn't drink it and in actual fact you didn't do that

253
00:19:35,800 --> 00:19:41,800
 If your rum is strong enough, I mean I'll drink it. Yeah, me too. Yeah, as if that's going to put you off. Yeah, exactly

254
00:19:41,800 --> 00:19:48,520
 I mean my plantation and we drink a lot of light tequila, you know, although the worm is only a recent thing, isn't it?

255
00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:50,760
 Yeah, the bottles have a little worm in them. Well, they don't all

256
00:19:51,080 --> 00:19:54,440
 I don't know and I think that could actually be a recent thing

257
00:19:54,440 --> 00:19:58,600
 Oh, really? So yeah, so and we're not even sure why they did it in the first place

258
00:19:58,600 --> 00:20:01,080
 Just one guy had a lot of spare ones in his scrotum

259
00:20:01,080 --> 00:20:08,200
 Do you know what I've been handed um, my friend went walking and found a load of ticks all over him

260
00:20:08,200 --> 00:20:10,280
 So he had a tiny little whiskey bottle

261
00:20:10,280 --> 00:20:16,040
 So he it's now in whiskey and I can't have an ad I haven't had the heart to put it in the collection because it looks so cute

262
00:20:16,040 --> 00:20:21,000
 And his only label he had on him was a plaster. So it's handwritten a plaster

263
00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:26,360
 Where on his body it was where he collected it in this little miniature of whiskey. So he's preserved it in that

264
00:20:26,360 --> 00:20:32,280
 How late and desperate into the night would it be before you decided that this was the last drink in the house?

265
00:20:32,280 --> 00:20:35,160
 Yeah, I've got a lot of those bottles

266
00:20:35,160 --> 00:20:38,680
 Um, can I tell you a bit about navy rum?

267
00:20:38,680 --> 00:20:42,440
 So this was the big thing in the Royal Navy. It was all sailors got a tot of rum every day

268
00:20:42,440 --> 00:20:46,920
 And in fact, it wasn't a tot it was about half a pint a day of rum

269
00:20:47,480 --> 00:20:52,120
 And this was you know, this was great. And then until in the 17 in 1740

270
00:20:52,120 --> 00:20:55,960
 It was watered down from that point on with like by one to five

271
00:20:55,960 --> 00:20:59,000
 So you did get your rum still half a pint, but it was watered down with two pints of water

272
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:04,120
 So it's a bit okay. So you were getting two and a half pints worth of stuff. Were you? Yeah, it was called grog

273
00:21:04,120 --> 00:21:08,280
 And basically if you were a senior officer

274
00:21:08,280 --> 00:21:11,400
 You were allowed to drink your rum neat because you were probably a trustworthy chap

275
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:15,640
 And if you were on the rest of the ship and able semen

276
00:21:15,880 --> 00:21:21,880
 Exactly untrustworthy. You'd go on a bender. Maybe you'd save it all up and that you'd you know, and you'd like steer the ship wrong

277
00:21:21,880 --> 00:21:23,640
 Anyway, so they had a watered down

278
00:21:23,640 --> 00:21:29,800
 Um, and basically this is the amazing ritual they had the officer of the day the master of tarms the supply petty officer and the butcher

279
00:21:29,800 --> 00:21:31,800
 No, I don't know what he's doing here

280
00:21:31,800 --> 00:21:34,920
 They meet at the ship spirit room. They unlock it

281
00:21:34,920 --> 00:21:40,360
 The butcher inserts his pump into the bunghole and I'm sorry. What come on steady on

282
00:21:40,360 --> 00:21:44,280
 He imaginates the

283
00:21:45,240 --> 00:21:50,360
 He draws off the ration which is then transferred to a small breaker which is spelled barico

284
00:21:50,360 --> 00:21:53,640
 But pronounced breaker. So that's then padlocked and then carried to the rum tub

285
00:21:53,640 --> 00:21:57,560
 At which point you've got the rum tub is now full of the day's rum

286
00:21:57,560 --> 00:22:01,240
 Then the rum call is sounded on bugle everyone gathers and you know

287
00:22:01,240 --> 00:22:04,840
 Then each mess like a little like let's say the four of us would be a mess

288
00:22:04,840 --> 00:22:07,880
 We would nominate a mess man. Let's say James is the mess man

289
00:22:07,880 --> 00:22:13,800
 James goes up gets the rum for all of us carries it back in his rum fanny

290
00:22:14,040 --> 00:22:16,040
 Which

291
00:22:16,040 --> 00:22:18,360
 That is the imagination

292
00:22:18,360 --> 00:22:21,880
 There's a large egg-shaped container for for our mess's rum

293
00:22:21,880 --> 00:22:25,400
 Right, and then while we're drinking it we sing a special song called Nancy Dawson

294
00:22:25,400 --> 00:22:29,960
 Oh, yeah, I know the Nancy Dawson song. I think I might have mentioned it before actually

295
00:22:29,960 --> 00:22:35,640
 Maybe we have but I think it is the same tune as here we go around the mulberry bush

296
00:22:35,640 --> 00:22:39,720
 Oh, okay, and it was about a famous sex worker called Nancy Dawson

297
00:22:40,520 --> 00:22:44,520
 And every sort of every verse is ruder and ruder than the last one

298
00:22:44,520 --> 00:22:49,080
 I've got to learn that version of the mulberry bush. I'm very bored of singing the other one

299
00:22:49,080 --> 00:22:52,360
 Um, do you know why it's called grog? I didn't know this

300
00:22:52,360 --> 00:22:58,600
 Um, but it's because for international listeners grog is sort of what we call general alcohol now quite often

301
00:22:58,600 --> 00:23:00,760
 Oh, yeah, we do grog. Yeah

302
00:23:00,760 --> 00:23:03,000
 You know, not if you're of a certain age perhaps

303
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:06,040
 Living the deep deep countryside

304
00:23:06,040 --> 00:23:09,800
 You don't get many orders in the sort of london cocktail bars

305
00:23:09,800 --> 00:23:11,800
 I frequent for a glass of grog

306
00:23:11,800 --> 00:23:14,440
 for 12 pounds

307
00:23:14,440 --> 00:23:18,040
 Gin and tonic, uh, a half of here's my rum fanny

308
00:23:18,040 --> 00:23:23,480
 And then around of here we get around the Nancy Bush order

309
00:23:23,480 --> 00:23:30,520
 No, it's because as Andy said in 1740 the rum was watered down because people were a bit worried that

310
00:23:30,520 --> 00:23:32,920
 sailors were getting out of control or being responsible

311
00:23:32,920 --> 00:23:39,240
 And it was watered down diluted by a chap called Admiral Vernon who was an admiral and he wore this big

312
00:23:39,480 --> 00:23:43,240
 Cloak, which was made of a special fabric that happened to be called grog rum

313
00:23:43,240 --> 00:23:48,440
 So people used to call him old grog and that's one of those nice etymologies where we just know it comes from there

314
00:23:48,440 --> 00:23:52,440
 Yeah, because it sounds fake, but it's not fake. Yeah, I mean he just wore this cloak

315
00:23:52,440 --> 00:23:56,680
 They called him old grog so they called drinks grog and we do to this day in some parts of the country

316
00:23:56,680 --> 00:23:58,840
 Did you know what grog blossom is?

317
00:23:58,840 --> 00:24:01,560
 No, is it have a punt?

318
00:24:01,560 --> 00:24:05,560
 I think you already know it. I do know it. Yeah, is it also to do with Admiral Vernon?

319
00:24:05,800 --> 00:24:13,400
 Did he have the case of genital warts or something? No, it's higher up. Okay, it is a bodily condition. It's even higher

320
00:24:13,400 --> 00:24:16,920
 Higher than your nipples. Yeah, strike north. Is it your nose?

321
00:24:16,920 --> 00:24:23,480
 It's your nose and your cheeks basically. Your countenance. Oh, that makes sense. It's the ruddy red

322
00:24:23,480 --> 00:24:28,760
 It's all where the blood vessels have sort of, you know, given up the ghost if you've been drinking a lot for a long time

323
00:24:28,760 --> 00:24:31,000
 Yes, yeah, exactly. Is that?

324
00:24:31,560 --> 00:24:37,560
 It's engrossed that, isn't it? Grosses dictionary. I read grosses dictionary for some other rum words because

325
00:24:37,560 --> 00:24:43,880
 Like we were talking before the mics came on about whether we say the word rum to mean, you know, like he's a rum bugger

326
00:24:43,880 --> 00:24:48,040
 We would say in bolton for instance dodgy rum. I'd say that's a bit run. Yeah

327
00:24:48,040 --> 00:24:53,880
 I wouldn't use it. Yeah, but you would say rum in that sense to mean bad, right? Kind of a bit dodgy

328
00:24:53,880 --> 00:24:58,280
 Yeah, yeah, but it did used to mean more like good like rum. Oh, that's you know

329
00:24:58,760 --> 00:25:01,960
 So your rum peepers would be very expensive glasses

330
00:25:01,960 --> 00:25:07,080
 You mean you mean spectacles? Spectacles. Yeah. Yeah. Rum draws. Do you know what they were?

331
00:25:07,080 --> 00:25:13,320
 E-R-A-W-E-R-S. They're where you smuggle your rum out of the rum shop in your drawers

332
00:25:13,320 --> 00:25:17,880
 Another word we use in the countryside. Yeah. Well, you're using the right kind of drawers

333
00:25:17,880 --> 00:25:20,520
 It's um silk or other fine stockings

334
00:25:20,520 --> 00:25:25,640
 Well known as rum drawers and uh rum gaggers. Do you know what a rum gaga was?

335
00:25:25,640 --> 00:25:27,800
 rum gaga

336
00:25:27,800 --> 00:25:29,880
 Um, someone who can't hold their drink

337
00:25:29,880 --> 00:25:37,320
 No, it was someone who would tell wonderful stories of their sufferings at sea or when taken by the Algerians

338
00:25:37,320 --> 00:25:42,280
 Have I had a nickel?

339
00:25:42,280 --> 00:25:49,000
 Well, and they would they would tell these stories and they'd get your confidence and then they would swindle you

340
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:50,280
 Oh

341
00:25:50,280 --> 00:25:51,480
 Rum gaggers

342
00:25:51,480 --> 00:25:53,880
 Right, okay. I found a thing which is

343
00:25:54,600 --> 00:25:59,720
 Uh in your wheelhouse Erica, which is related to rum. Can you have a guess?

344
00:25:59,720 --> 00:26:04,200
 So related to insects we're thinking. Yeah, it's oh and all these things insects

345
00:26:04,200 --> 00:26:11,720
 Okay related to insects slash arachnids. It's certainly creepy crawly. Mini beasts. They call them. Oh, don't you see there are those terms?

346
00:26:11,720 --> 00:26:18,280
 Okay, I don't like either of them. I like mini beast. It's a bit. Well, it's a bit cutesy, but for children, it's still beast

347
00:26:18,280 --> 00:26:22,440
 I see that's negative. I just think the negative word should be mini great guys

348
00:26:22,680 --> 00:26:28,520
 Beast and I mean beasts are exciting. You know, we don't say big beasts. We don't so low. I do

349
00:26:28,520 --> 00:26:33,240
 Well, okay, we can play beast for a good thing and some beast

350
00:26:33,240 --> 00:26:36,600
 Another one that we use alongside rum and crawl

351
00:26:36,600 --> 00:26:40,360
 In the wilds of Huntinghamshire

352
00:26:40,360 --> 00:26:45,480
 Okay, I'll tell you it's the Isle of Rub. Yes. This has this is off Scotland

353
00:26:45,480 --> 00:26:48,440
 Yep, and it is home to the biggest something in the uk

354
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:52,520
 Oh, this is it's got a huge population of red deer

355
00:26:52,920 --> 00:27:01,400
 Might it be a something that lives on a red deer? Well, uh, I'm very surprised because these are the largest worms in the uk

356
00:27:01,400 --> 00:27:09,160
 Found on rum the Isle of Rum. They're three times bigger than your standard worm. It's basically like dune the Isle of Rum

357
00:27:09,160 --> 00:27:11,240
 It's like this huge

358
00:27:11,240 --> 00:27:15,640
 Um these worms. Yeah, they're just worms. Are they are they different types?

359
00:27:16,520 --> 00:27:23,240
 Just take that away. The earthworm specialist in the museum right now will be having kittens thinking about you saying just words

360
00:27:23,240 --> 00:27:29,160
 Just kittens. Are they common or garden worms? They are. They're standard earthworms. They're earthworms

361
00:27:29,160 --> 00:27:33,480
 But they the reason they've grown massive is that they I know holiday horses are a kid

362
00:27:33,480 --> 00:27:39,560
 They there are no predators. It's island gigantism. It's island gigantism. The soil is very fertile

363
00:27:39,560 --> 00:27:42,600
 scientists from the uni of central Lancashire have

364
00:27:42,600 --> 00:27:45,880
 They apparently discovered very large worm burrows

365
00:27:45,960 --> 00:27:47,960
 I don't know how large but they're big

366
00:27:47,960 --> 00:27:53,000
 It's like fantasy pretty much and they apparently they might be living for up to 10 years

367
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:59,000
 And a normal worm lives two years on the mainland the natural predator of a worm. I would say is the early bird

368
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:05,160
 Do they not have birds on rum then well because it's it's further north, you know, it gets light later

369
00:28:05,160 --> 00:28:07,240
 So the early bird can't see what it's doing

370
00:28:07,240 --> 00:28:12,760
 Do you know what's splicing the main braces? Is it where you have a rope and you cut it so that it?

371
00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:16,040
 That's why I always say it's very close to it. Is it what I thought splice?

372
00:28:16,040 --> 00:28:20,760
 Yeah, you define it too. Basically these days it means give everyone aboard some rum a tot of rum

373
00:28:20,760 --> 00:28:24,040
 But back in the day it meant something incredibly fiddly

374
00:28:24,040 --> 00:28:28,680
 Which then was so fiddly that everyone who'd done it deserved the extra tot of rum

375
00:28:28,680 --> 00:28:33,880
 The main brace is a piece of rope and it's the longest line in what they call the running rigging and the running rigging

376
00:28:33,880 --> 00:28:39,400
 Is what keeps the ship mobile. It's what means you can navigate basically as opposed to the standing rigging

377
00:28:39,480 --> 00:28:45,080
 Which is what keeps the mast in place right and the main brace is the longest and most complicated bit

378
00:28:45,080 --> 00:28:50,680
 It's the most fiddly changing job to do because it goes through all sorts of bits of wood and it's just you know

379
00:28:50,680 --> 00:28:55,080
 You have to oh god. It's just so so fiddly and so that's what that's what means it

380
00:28:55,080 --> 00:28:57,800
 That's what means it is it that's what means it

381
00:28:57,800 --> 00:29:01,480
 Sorry for using my nautical terms

382
00:29:01,480 --> 00:29:05,320
 Yeah, so and that's what

383
00:29:05,480 --> 00:29:09,240
 Spliced the main brace now it's just a ceremonial thing, but originally it had a meaning of

384
00:29:09,240 --> 00:29:12,120
 Yeah, but they both it resulted in rum basically

385
00:29:12,120 --> 00:29:17,560
 So we should say that rum is no longer in the navy rations, but it lasted so due to woke

386
00:29:17,560 --> 00:29:19,560
 Whoa, indeed

387
00:29:19,560 --> 00:29:25,960
 It lasted a bloody long time until 1970 and I was reading the hands-on debate the parliamentary debate for when it was abolished

388
00:29:25,960 --> 00:29:27,960
 And the outrage was palpable

389
00:29:27,960 --> 00:29:31,560
 MPs just standing up one after the other dr

390
00:29:31,560 --> 00:29:38,360
 Reginald bennett mp for gossport and ferrum saying I represent a constituency which has been plunged into gloom and horror by this

391
00:29:38,360 --> 00:29:39,960
 Iniquitous decision

392
00:29:39,960 --> 00:29:45,880
 So the reason it was abolished was because it was said that maybe their judgment in quite fiddly tasks at war could be impaired

393
00:29:45,880 --> 00:29:47,960
 Splicer than base brace

394
00:29:47,960 --> 00:29:54,040
 Could be impaired by having a rum ration and the answer is that no no well

395
00:29:54,040 --> 00:29:57,800
 We've used it and now my friend got bought flying his head. So we needed

396
00:29:57,800 --> 00:30:01,400
 We needed the rum for him for morale or for

397
00:30:01,560 --> 00:30:04,120
 His yeah to slightly anesthetize him

398
00:30:04,120 --> 00:30:08,200
 So when you split open is quite how deep so it embeds itself in your well

399
00:30:08,200 --> 00:30:11,720
 It doesn't because it because of your skull. He just goes along so you can see it growing

400
00:30:11,720 --> 00:30:16,920
 If you just leave it will it get better? Yeah. Oh, um, there's this beautiful guy

401
00:30:16,920 --> 00:30:20,040
 Gil he's he did a study of his own bot fly

402
00:30:20,040 --> 00:30:24,040
 And so he's got all the photos and then he's got the adult winner hatched out

403
00:30:24,040 --> 00:30:26,760
 That's like an entomological dream

404
00:30:26,760 --> 00:30:29,160
 Because it's been part of you

405
00:30:29,880 --> 00:30:32,760
 We really became a foster parent. So he's quite pleased

406
00:30:32,760 --> 00:30:37,480
 I mean, it's it's a bit upsetting apparently if you get bought flight at night because you can hear it

407
00:30:37,480 --> 00:30:38,920
 Oh, wow

408
00:30:38,920 --> 00:30:43,320
 And if you around yours, it's cool. Well, I don't move around. It's so but what do you hear it doing?

409
00:30:43,320 --> 00:30:45,880
 Um eating and defecating

410
00:30:45,880 --> 00:30:49,880
 So it's just like you're asleep and he's going

411
00:30:49,880 --> 00:30:55,240
 I'd give that a minute

412
00:30:55,960 --> 00:30:57,960
 Okay

413
00:30:57,960 --> 00:31:08,040
 It's time for fact number three and that is james. Okay. My fact this week is that the amazon rainforest is man made

414
00:31:08,040 --> 00:31:12,600
 No, not having it. What's it? Is it sort of a blast? It's all plastic. Yeah

415
00:31:12,600 --> 00:31:15,560
 It's all mobile phone masks

416
00:31:15,560 --> 00:31:23,240
 So I bring this up because erica's just come back from the amazon but the basic argument is

417
00:31:24,520 --> 00:31:29,400
 That the amazon's home to 16 000 trees a species of tree

418
00:31:29,400 --> 00:31:34,680
 But 227 of them cover more than half of the forest ecosystem

419
00:31:34,680 --> 00:31:39,400
 Which is suggestive of people deliberately planting them in certain places

420
00:31:39,400 --> 00:31:43,880
 And there seems to be two distinct layers of soil in the forest

421
00:31:43,880 --> 00:31:49,240
 The bottom layer is kind of the normal stuff you find around there which has got quite poor fertility

422
00:31:49,640 --> 00:31:55,400
 But then there's a top layer called terra preta, which is like some kind of super soil that's made with

423
00:31:55,400 --> 00:31:59,800
 Like burnt charcoal and stuff. So it's as if humans have made that

424
00:31:59,800 --> 00:32:03,080
 And the more kind of deforestation we do

425
00:32:03,080 --> 00:32:05,720
 Thank god we're doing this deforestation

426
00:32:05,720 --> 00:32:11,400
 Because we find evidence of farming societies of human structures of artifacts

427
00:32:11,400 --> 00:32:17,240
 And even recently they've been doing laser technology from the air and they're finding earth and mounds hidden

428
00:32:17,960 --> 00:32:22,840
 And lots of what they think are ancient roads that go in between all these places where people lived

429
00:32:22,840 --> 00:32:27,560
 And there is a historical evidence that when europeans first arrived there

430
00:32:27,560 --> 00:32:29,880
 They said that lots of people were living there

431
00:32:29,880 --> 00:32:36,760
 And now of course very very few people live there. So that's the argument. I buy it. Yeah, I absolutely buy it

432
00:32:36,760 --> 00:32:43,560
 Well, you know, it seems when I wedged this I was like, oh, so I went back to all the primary sources and I was like, oh

433
00:32:44,200 --> 00:32:51,160
 Uh, the thing is they do make a valid point. Yeah to say that the amazon is man made. However

434
00:32:51,160 --> 00:32:53,880
 I mean, no, there probably would have been something there

435
00:32:53,880 --> 00:33:00,440
 They probably would have been lots of trees in this area even if people hadn't so we wish but yeah, you're shaping some of the

436
00:33:00,440 --> 00:33:05,880
 Is a nice way of saying it because these species we didn't make these species. No

437
00:33:05,880 --> 00:33:12,040
 So we are manipulating the environment to that extent nothing is man made even this building we're in now because it's all

438
00:33:12,840 --> 00:33:15,800
 Okay, that's I think about these are secondary and tertiary

439
00:33:15,800 --> 00:33:19,800
 But when it comes to the actual species if we're just manipulating them along the way like that

440
00:33:19,800 --> 00:33:21,960
 I think the amazon is man manipulated

441
00:33:21,960 --> 00:33:28,120
 Yeah, I mean maybe so they it was quite extensive as well. So they did over a thousand plots

442
00:33:28,120 --> 00:33:33,720
 Yeah, and quite far apart. So what to test to test. Yeah, it's so cool. Yeah

443
00:33:33,720 --> 00:33:38,280
 There's an the area of this soil the terra preta is twice the size of great britain

444
00:33:38,680 --> 00:33:42,840
 Uh, it's got lots of fish bones and seeds in it. They basically burned it to produce charcoal

445
00:33:42,840 --> 00:33:46,360
 So this it's really fertile stuff. It's really good soil

446
00:33:46,360 --> 00:33:51,720
 And it dates from the last 2000 years this terra preta. I mean the argument against it is maybe there was a fire

447
00:33:51,720 --> 00:33:57,240
 And maybe then it was washed down by the amazon and blah blah blah. I mean that's just to say that's the right argument

448
00:33:57,240 --> 00:34:03,240
 I can't believe it. See we're all we're all now thinking and arguing like the amazon being partially man made is the more plausible explanation

449
00:34:03,240 --> 00:34:05,400
 But this layer it can be 12 feet thick

450
00:34:05,560 --> 00:34:11,400
 It's really thick and basically the I love the idea that basically the primary building material in the amazon was the soil

451
00:34:11,400 --> 00:34:13,960
 So it's not it's not built

452
00:34:13,960 --> 00:34:18,200
 I do think you've got to be careful by saying I mean there is

453
00:34:18,200 --> 00:34:22,840
 Yes areas of it have been manipulated by humans, but I don't think me not the whole thing

454
00:34:22,840 --> 00:34:25,560
 I just want to just take a plan a bit

455
00:34:25,560 --> 00:34:30,120
 But the reason it doesn't look like what we think of as a you know built environment is that so much

456
00:34:30,120 --> 00:34:33,480
 If you're moving large amounts of soil around it doesn't look like that to us

457
00:34:33,560 --> 00:34:38,600
 So um percy force at the explorer who went looking for the lost cities of the amazon great name. There is such a good name

458
00:34:38,600 --> 00:34:42,520
 There was a theory that when he came through you know on his travels

459
00:34:42,520 --> 00:34:44,840
 He may have walked through some of these sites

460
00:34:44,840 --> 00:34:50,520
 Which actually were the city he was looking for and not recognize them as that because he didn't know about this soil

461
00:34:50,520 --> 00:34:57,880
 Because they're not like western cities also wasn't he hoping to find a existing living city lots of bustling people trading hanging out

462
00:34:57,880 --> 00:35:00,520
 I don't think he was hoping to find a series of slightly raised

463
00:35:01,560 --> 00:35:04,600
 Black soil. He was hoping they would be made of gold rather than black soil

464
00:35:04,600 --> 00:35:10,520
 It just it seems almost inevitable because I really hadn't realized how many people were there um

465
00:35:10,520 --> 00:35:15,560
 In the amazon itself and the amazon rainforest when columbus arrived from 1492

466
00:35:15,560 --> 00:35:18,040
 So there were probably between eight and ten

467
00:35:18,040 --> 00:35:23,000
 Million indigenous people living there, which is at least five times more than there are today living in the amazon

468
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:28,840
 So when you've got millions and millions of people it makes sense. Of course, they're going to be sculpting things. It is very big

469
00:35:29,400 --> 00:35:32,360
 It's large. Yes. So if you have eight million people there

470
00:35:32,360 --> 00:35:37,720
 I worked out that would give you a population density still less dense than mongolia

471
00:35:37,720 --> 00:35:43,960
 Which is the least dense big country in the world and about three times emptier than modern Australia

472
00:35:43,960 --> 00:35:47,560
 Yeah, it's wildly big. Okay. Okay. I mean, it's still a lot of people

473
00:35:47,560 --> 00:35:50,280
 It's always what scares me about going to it. The idea of getting lost

474
00:35:50,280 --> 00:35:56,200
 It's 28 times bigger than the uk just I can't I mean humans aren't very good at conceptualizing

475
00:35:56,600 --> 00:36:02,680
 Space and it is huge. I just we were on the on a boat going across the amazon and this is like, you know

476
00:36:02,680 --> 00:36:05,720
 This is not at the mouth. So this is really quite narrow

477
00:36:05,720 --> 00:36:07,720
 Where else were you what sir?

478
00:36:07,720 --> 00:36:13,080
 In kitos in peru. So you're up, you know the other end you're not down in my house

479
00:36:13,080 --> 00:36:17,160
 You haven't got the the amazon that is fattest, but even still I'm like, oh my god

480
00:36:17,160 --> 00:36:19,960
 The idea of a river being this wide

481
00:36:19,960 --> 00:36:23,880
 You know, it's still I'm not used to it. I'm from the uk

482
00:36:24,600 --> 00:36:26,600
 Wide than the tenson

483
00:36:26,600 --> 00:36:31,960
 Because the tenson gets pretty wide if you go down, you know, doppelganger's way, it's wide

484
00:36:31,960 --> 00:36:38,200
 You can still see the other side. Yeah, that's true. You can't see the other side. No, there are bits. You can't. You're just like, this is amazing

485
00:36:38,200 --> 00:36:40,920
 Holy moly. Do you even know then? How do you even know?

486
00:36:40,920 --> 00:36:44,440
 It sounds like you're on the coast

487
00:36:44,440 --> 00:36:49,560
 But no, it was weird because we were a bit where there's all these different tributaries coming in and so there's one bit

488
00:36:49,560 --> 00:36:51,560
 You're just like, this is amazing, you know

489
00:36:51,560 --> 00:36:53,960
 Well, we did throw a tarantula in

490
00:36:54,280 --> 00:36:58,040
 But it's all right because we were a tarantula. It wasn't on purpose and I didn't do it

491
00:36:58,040 --> 00:37:02,040
 I'll have you notice but uh, it was one of the students panicked or a tarantula on him

492
00:37:02,040 --> 00:37:08,440
 And so she just threw it into the amazon and died. Look, it swam off. So luckily, yeah

493
00:37:08,440 --> 00:37:14,600
 I'm amazed tarantulas can swim and do they swim um, like an underwater breast milk? Crawl surely crawl

494
00:37:14,600 --> 00:37:20,040
 It's going to be more like the butterfly I presume. Yeah, okay. That's good. That's good like that

495
00:37:20,200 --> 00:37:25,800
 We should say about the amazon being partially man-made thing. Oh, yeah, it sounds like oh, you might take the implication that

496
00:37:25,800 --> 00:37:31,400
 Uh, oh, well, it's fine. What we're doing now then and what this was is this is people producing food in quite small batches

497
00:37:31,400 --> 00:37:35,160
 Yeah, they did have things like fish farms, but it was it was relatively sustainable

498
00:37:35,160 --> 00:37:39,960
 Whereas what we have now is chopping down ancient forests to grow soy or raise cattle

499
00:37:39,960 --> 00:37:45,080
 Which is really really really really unsustainable. Although in good news, which we don't get a lot

500
00:37:45,880 --> 00:37:50,840
 In the prime world of climate change. It is getting better as in I mean

501
00:37:50,840 --> 00:37:55,800
 I don't think we make enough of a big deal about the fact that bolton arrow left power and lula came in

502
00:37:55,800 --> 00:38:02,280
 Given the awful damage that he was doing. Yeah, you're looking skeptical, but there's no question that he's better

503
00:38:02,280 --> 00:38:08,120
 So deforestation in brazil has halved yeah, but in fact halved this is again see the figures

504
00:38:08,120 --> 00:38:11,960
 It's still very bad. It's really bad. It's better than doubled as in the direct

505
00:38:12,040 --> 00:38:16,840
 No, no, no, I mean, you're right. We have to be positive, but I still think we all need to we've got to stop it

506
00:38:16,840 --> 00:38:21,080
 I think it's something like in the 80s the amount deforested globally per year was roughly the size of india

507
00:38:21,080 --> 00:38:22,920
 And now it's and now it's the size of switzerland

508
00:38:22,920 --> 00:38:27,080
 It just shows how big it is that it's still some of it's still left, right? It's amazing

509
00:38:27,080 --> 00:38:31,400
 So we I'm going out there and we're looking for new species and we're doing all of this and it's still, you know

510
00:38:31,400 --> 00:38:37,480
 I could just walk down this tiny little transect next to where I'm staying and knowing that I'm looking at new things to science

511
00:38:37,480 --> 00:38:40,600
 And it's just so sad. We're kind of this, you know

512
00:38:40,600 --> 00:38:42,760
 the pos the probability of life

513
00:38:42,760 --> 00:38:46,840
 Is so random and it's so odd the fact that I'm here and you're here

514
00:38:46,840 --> 00:38:52,200
 It's also random and all these different species and this is the only proven bit of life this planet

515
00:38:52,200 --> 00:38:55,400
 And yet we're hell bent on destroying it and it's like come on

516
00:38:55,400 --> 00:39:00,040
 It's it's an amazing thing. I caught okay. This is my favorite discovery of the amazon

517
00:39:00,040 --> 00:39:04,760
 We caught this stick insect and my friend was like the woman who got it and she was like eric, what's that?

518
00:39:04,760 --> 00:39:10,360
 He's got an egg on it and I'm like, oh, it's this midge and this midge feeds on the veins

519
00:39:10,920 --> 00:39:14,520
 Of the wings of this stick insect and it's engorged

520
00:39:14,520 --> 00:39:19,880
 It's engorged now imagine growing your abdomen to the size of this table

521
00:39:19,880 --> 00:39:26,200
 You know, like mr. Creosote is the only thing I can think of that's but mr. Creosote would have to be four or five times bigger

522
00:39:26,200 --> 00:39:33,000
 To be this anyone else not no, I'm afraid I don't know that's a modi python sketch with the guy who's just had a huge great meal

523
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:35,880
 One more waffa thin meat. Oh waffa thin!

524
00:39:37,160 --> 00:39:40,440
 But yeah, but it was amazing and this midge does it all around the planet

525
00:39:40,440 --> 00:39:42,760
 And I'm working with this guy at the moment

526
00:39:42,760 --> 00:39:47,800
 And he's he's looking at all these migrating insects and some of them will latch on to a dragonfly

527
00:39:47,800 --> 00:39:51,480
 So the dragonflies can migrate in their masses on there

528
00:39:51,480 --> 00:39:56,280
 um migrating across continents and there's this little female midge

529
00:39:56,280 --> 00:39:59,160
 Cleaning on like feeding go whoo

530
00:39:59,160 --> 00:40:01,480
 What's going on here?

531
00:40:01,480 --> 00:40:06,280
 And so it's like all of these little discoveries everywhere. Yeah. Oh, it does sound incredible

532
00:40:06,520 --> 00:40:10,360
 I love it and some quite scary stuff some quite painful insects there

533
00:40:10,360 --> 00:40:13,880
 I think they've got the most painful insect in the world the bullet ant. Yeah, um, which

534
00:40:13,880 --> 00:40:18,680
 Is this painful as being shot hence the name 30 times more painful than a bee sting

535
00:40:18,680 --> 00:40:21,720
 But the satari maway people have this ritual though

536
00:40:21,720 --> 00:40:25,960
 I don't think we've mentioned before where boys from 12 onwards you have to gather them up

537
00:40:25,960 --> 00:40:29,720
 You make gloves special bullet and gloves and you stuff your gloves full of them, don't you?

538
00:40:29,720 --> 00:40:31,720
 And it's to sort of prove

539
00:40:31,720 --> 00:40:34,280
 Well, I read a quite nice quote from a tribe chief

540
00:40:34,760 --> 00:40:40,840
 Who said it's meant to show that a life without suffering or without any kind of effort isn't worth anything at all

541
00:40:40,840 --> 00:40:43,240
 To teach you that suffering

542
00:40:43,240 --> 00:40:48,920
 Is a crucial part of being alive. Well, I suppose so. Yeah, it does feel like extra sort of bonus suffering though

543
00:40:48,920 --> 00:40:52,200
 Yeah, I mean it sounds like I'm a celebrity get me out

544
00:40:52,200 --> 00:40:56,920
 Well, actually Steve I did a podcast with Steve Batchel and he was saying he did that

545
00:40:56,920 --> 00:41:01,400
 So he does nature's dead leaves. Okay. And um, he was reduced to tears

546
00:41:01,480 --> 00:41:06,760
 It was the most he said it was extruded and he did the bullet and yeah, he did the bullet and you know

547
00:41:06,760 --> 00:41:12,600
 It's 13 14 year old boys generally and yeah, there's this growing man who's he's completely tough

548
00:41:12,600 --> 00:41:19,000
 And he was just but yeah, I feel like teenage boys can cope with a lot of uh, weird stuff

549
00:41:30,280 --> 00:41:35,560
 Okay, it's time for our final fact of the show that is my fact my fact is the man who invented the karaoke machine

550
00:41:35,560 --> 00:41:40,520
 Also invented a device you could throw at robbers as they ran away. So they would be indelibly died

551
00:41:40,520 --> 00:41:42,120
 Oh

552
00:41:42,120 --> 00:41:48,200
 That's that died. No, sorry. Sorry. You cover them in dye. Um, so this is a guy

553
00:41:48,200 --> 00:41:53,080
 Who's called shigetchi negishi and he has just died

554
00:41:53,080 --> 00:41:58,280
 And again, I'm using the died word to mean he's he's passed away this year aged 100

555
00:41:58,360 --> 00:42:03,000
 He was born in 1923 amazing and he invented the karaoke machine

556
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:07,320
 So japan had all these kind of early versions that were kind of approaching karaoke

557
00:42:07,320 --> 00:42:08,760
 And he was in the right place at the right time

558
00:42:08,760 --> 00:42:13,400
 He ran his own electronics firm basically and there was a radio show called pop songs without lyrics

559
00:42:13,400 --> 00:42:17,240
 Which is quite karaoke-ish, you know, they just play the songs and then you can sing along

560
00:42:17,240 --> 00:42:21,480
 and he was teased about his singing voice brutally by his boss and

561
00:42:21,480 --> 00:42:26,200
 He he was sad about that and he thought maybe it would sound better if he had a professional proper backing track

562
00:42:26,840 --> 00:42:29,000
 Behind him and so he wasn't just singing along to the radio

563
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:33,240
 So he asked a colleague to hook up a microphone and he could hear himself singing then

564
00:42:33,240 --> 00:42:37,800
 Over the recording so rather than just him singing. He's hearing himself through the speakers

565
00:42:37,800 --> 00:42:44,280
 And that's what he set up and he called that the sparko box and that is basically the first karaoke machine

566
00:42:44,280 --> 00:42:47,640
 Yeah, that's amazing. He's invented this this other thing as well

567
00:42:47,640 --> 00:42:54,200
 So ironically the thing that's famous for revealing people's inability to sing was made by someone who wanted to improve his singing

568
00:42:54,760 --> 00:42:59,480
 That was tragic. Yeah, and there was actually loads of people like you say who kind of claimed

569
00:42:59,480 --> 00:43:03,320
 Invention of the karaoke machine, right because it was of its time

570
00:43:03,320 --> 00:43:07,160
 It was just like let you say there was this program on and lots of people doing it

571
00:43:07,160 --> 00:43:12,600
 There was another guy called Inui Daisuke and he had been he was a keyboard player

572
00:43:12,600 --> 00:43:18,280
 And people used to invite him around to play keyboard so they could sing because it would improve their performance

573
00:43:18,280 --> 00:43:24,360
 And then so many people were asking him that he thought well, maybe I'll come up with a way of recording my

574
00:43:24,760 --> 00:43:27,800
 Keyboard playing and then people can use that as a backing track

575
00:43:27,800 --> 00:43:31,000
 But he also invented a cockroach repellent

576
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:34,280
 So he was also a double inventor

577
00:43:34,280 --> 00:43:41,400
 It's so interesting. People. How did you repell cockroaches? Oh, that's a great question. He's in trouble now. No, it doesn't

578
00:43:41,400 --> 00:43:47,800
 I don't know is the answer. Um, but the problem was that his karaoke machines were getting infested by cockroaches

579
00:43:47,800 --> 00:43:49,960
 I know it's not the cockroaches fault

580
00:43:50,200 --> 00:43:54,840
 I know that they just like karaoke machines, but they would get inside build nests and chew on the wires

581
00:43:54,840 --> 00:43:57,320
 Have you not seen joe's apartment?

582
00:43:57,320 --> 00:44:01,640
 Who's apartment joe's apartment is the film with the singing cockroaches

583
00:44:01,640 --> 00:44:06,680
 No, no, it's this tenement building in new york and the guy moves in and the whole place is falling down

584
00:44:06,680 --> 00:44:10,280
 So the cockroaches all start helping each other, but they're always singing

585
00:44:10,280 --> 00:44:16,280
 So maybe that's why they were in the karaoke machines because they really liked it. No, it's pretty ratatouille

586
00:44:16,680 --> 00:44:21,480
 Yeah, it's like a it's like a much i'm sorry less cute version of ratatouille. I'm sorry

587
00:44:21,480 --> 00:44:26,920
 Can I ask erica we would discuss him before the mites came on about

588
00:44:26,920 --> 00:44:32,200
 How if you read a book or watch a movie where it's not entomologically correct

589
00:44:32,200 --> 00:44:36,840
 You don't enjoy it quite as much. Okay, right Jurassic park when it came out

590
00:44:36,840 --> 00:44:39,480
 Okay

591
00:44:41,160 --> 00:44:44,440
 Okay, there was no we we ignored the dinosaur bit. We just let that go

592
00:44:44,440 --> 00:44:49,960
 But when they had old dicky with his little uh stave and it had the mosquito in it

593
00:44:49,960 --> 00:44:52,920
 The first scene of that is not a mosquito. It's a crane flower. No

594
00:44:52,920 --> 00:44:59,320
 And I'm like, oh god, and then they do show a mosquito and it's a male and we're like no because males don't

595
00:44:59,320 --> 00:45:04,120
 Click blood and and it's so big. We think actually it was the toxic iron kites

596
00:45:04,120 --> 00:45:07,080
 Which obviously you all know that even the females don't love feed

597
00:45:07,640 --> 00:45:14,440
 So we were like in entomological rage almost every film that you ever watch would have a fly or some sort of insects

598
00:45:14,440 --> 00:45:21,400
 In the background even just flying around, right? So really every film should employ an entomologist just to make sure

599
00:45:21,400 --> 00:45:24,600
 Yeah, yeah, you come up with a website fly mdb. Yeah

600
00:45:24,600 --> 00:45:27,960
 Some movies, yeah

601
00:45:27,960 --> 00:45:33,560
 Fat karaoke. Oh, yeah quickly. Are you guys karaoke fans? I do. I love karaoke. Do you?

602
00:45:34,280 --> 00:45:38,360
 Well, no, I mean these days now that I have a child and no life. I don't do it so much

603
00:45:38,360 --> 00:45:40,920
 But I certainly used to do it all the I used to do it every week

604
00:45:40,920 --> 00:45:46,120
 I've never invited arson to be honest. I'm okay with that me and jenny ryan from the chase. We used to do

605
00:45:46,120 --> 00:45:53,640
 Yeah, yeah, we got asked in australia to leave a bar because we weren't respecting the karaoke. Oh really?

606
00:45:53,640 --> 00:45:56,760
 Yeah, what do you mean? Well, we were we were laughing too much

607
00:45:56,760 --> 00:46:02,600
 Um, it was very much will you go you were breaking into the machines getting the cockroaches out?

608
00:46:02,840 --> 00:46:06,680
 We were just we were just not respecting because it is a really serious

609
00:46:06,680 --> 00:46:10,280
 They do take it very seriously in a lot of asian countries

610
00:46:10,280 --> 00:46:13,320
 And what I found really interesting is that it's particularly huge in japan

611
00:46:13,320 --> 00:46:16,040
 Of course it was invented and you know everyone still does it

612
00:46:16,040 --> 00:46:22,200
 And it's also very big in europe certainly and I think outside of asia is biggest in finland

613
00:46:22,200 --> 00:46:26,440
 And I was reading an article about this and lots of people said the same thing

614
00:46:26,440 --> 00:46:29,640
 Which is that both of them have populations that are quite reserved

615
00:46:30,040 --> 00:46:34,520
 Or the finland one was saying that finnish people tend to be quite reserved and a lot of the fins who love karaoke

616
00:46:34,520 --> 00:46:38,760
 Were saying it's kind of a way of going out without having to spontaneously communicate with each other

617
00:46:38,760 --> 00:46:43,560
 Because you can go out and you just have to do this other thing. I see you like doing a pub quiz. That's a very good

618
00:46:43,560 --> 00:46:51,320
 I do like that kind of activity. There you go like a game one which replaces proper communication. Yeah, exactly

619
00:46:51,320 --> 00:46:54,360
 What does karaoke mean? It means empty orchestra

620
00:46:54,360 --> 00:46:59,640
 And the term existed before uh mr. Negishi came up with his sparko box

621
00:46:59,880 --> 00:47:04,120
 It was an industry term and it was when singers went around the country to rural areas

622
00:47:04,120 --> 00:47:07,160
 They would sometimes not have an orchestra with them

623
00:47:07,160 --> 00:47:13,000
 So they would play with a just a tape like a tape backing them. They'd do the gig but the orchestra was empty

624
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:16,840
 Uh, it can be bad for you. Can it yeah 2019

625
00:47:16,840 --> 00:47:20,280
 There was a man whose lung collapsed

626
00:47:20,280 --> 00:47:25,720
 Due to the high lung pressure caused by singing high notes according to the paper

627
00:47:26,200 --> 00:47:31,960
 There was a study in 2003 saying that people who sing regularly in this was in Korea

628
00:47:31,960 --> 00:47:37,880
 They have sounds higher than 95 decibels and it can cause hearing damage

629
00:47:37,880 --> 00:47:41,080
 Do you know what there's a

630
00:47:41,080 --> 00:47:46,040
 Slightly off-track you're just talking about hearing damage. There's a uh, it's a micro nectar

631
00:47:46,040 --> 00:47:53,720
 It's a tiny little water bug and it stridulates with its penis and thankfully it's in water because otherwise it's 99 decibels

632
00:47:54,280 --> 00:47:56,280
 Oh

633
00:47:56,280 --> 00:48:01,320
 Like an orchestra front row of an orchestra and that's nice. Is Mozart or my list?

634
00:48:01,320 --> 00:48:05,400
 Well, I presume he's trying to be as nice as possible because we're trying to attract the ladies

635
00:48:05,400 --> 00:48:12,360
 So, yeah, wouldn't it be amazing if humans did that and that's what your orchestra was. Yeah, just the the string section

636
00:48:12,360 --> 00:48:22,840
 Um, but this is the thing about so mr. Negishi invented this thing but he invented lots of other stuff too and inventors frequently do

637
00:48:23,080 --> 00:48:29,320
 Yeah, they're inventing things kind of the way business people. It doesn't actually matter what the business is what they're good at is doing business

638
00:48:29,320 --> 00:48:32,280
 You know what I mean and the inventors invent and that thing

639
00:48:32,280 --> 00:48:33,720
 I like they

640
00:48:33,720 --> 00:48:38,440
 Can I drop the plug with the book because the whole yeah, so this right recent book is all about

641
00:48:38,440 --> 00:48:44,200
 People looking at nature going do you know what that's amazing and let's think about how we can copy it

642
00:48:44,200 --> 00:48:49,320
 My favorite ones are like a maggot and they they're making tiny little nano robots

643
00:48:49,400 --> 00:48:55,880
 That look like maggots that can actually now go through your body some of the maggots. They're looking at um encapsulating medicine

644
00:48:55,880 --> 00:48:59,400
 You know, they're they're being inspired by these things already there

645
00:48:59,400 --> 00:49:02,680
 And I love the fact that people are looking at nature in a different way

646
00:49:02,680 --> 00:49:06,840
 So it's all different people some of them might be artists some of them might be you know engineers

647
00:49:06,840 --> 00:49:10,440
 Some of them are medics so lots and lots of different disciplines

648
00:49:10,440 --> 00:49:12,120
 And I think that's what's really great

649
00:49:12,120 --> 00:49:15,080
 Evolution has taken millions of years to get the insects to where they are

650
00:49:15,400 --> 00:49:21,160
 And we're just nicking it and we're just in the last minute coming in taking the glory. Have you got a favorite invention based on that?

651
00:49:21,160 --> 00:49:27,160
 I quite like our debridement therapy. So this is maggots eating necrotic flesh

652
00:49:27,160 --> 00:49:31,080
 Oh, yeah. Yeah, I love that one and the fact that we can get it on the nhs

653
00:49:31,080 --> 00:49:36,840
 Can you can anyone get it? Yeah, great. I'll I'll ask well you have to bring your own necrotic flesh

654
00:49:36,840 --> 00:49:39,320
 I think you can't just say I'd like some maggots, please

655
00:49:39,720 --> 00:49:46,120
 No, and they come now in little like teabags. So because people get offended by maggots crawling around their flesh. I prefer loose leaf

656
00:49:46,120 --> 00:49:51,400
 I read the other day that

657
00:49:51,400 --> 00:49:54,760
 Fiennes fly traps, which you probably hate Erika because they eat flies

658
00:49:54,760 --> 00:49:58,440
 But they will also eat human athlete's foot

659
00:49:58,440 --> 00:50:02,520
 Skin if you feed it to them someone tried it and it worked

660
00:50:02,520 --> 00:50:07,640
 But they won't you can't put your foot in and then pull it out an hour later and

661
00:50:08,680 --> 00:50:11,640
 You mean like those fish that nibble? Yeah, exactly. Yeah

662
00:50:11,640 --> 00:50:15,320
 Your shopping center experience went really badly, didn't it?

663
00:50:15,320 --> 00:50:18,680
 But no that is

664
00:50:18,680 --> 00:50:23,720
 I think you'd need to wiggle it about because the trap won't close unless it thinks it's an insect, right?

665
00:50:23,720 --> 00:50:27,720
 So right, okay, you need to get a piece of athlete's foot skin off your foot

666
00:50:27,720 --> 00:50:31,560
 Wiggle it around so that it closes on it, but it will digest it and it will eat it

667
00:50:31,560 --> 00:50:33,160
 Oh

668
00:50:33,160 --> 00:50:39,560
 Beautiful. Um, can I send you my favorite inventor? Yeah, I'll tell Fisher. So he died in 2016

669
00:50:39,560 --> 00:50:41,720
 He had 1100 patents to his name

670
00:50:41,720 --> 00:50:44,760
 And his main thing is the Fisher wall plug

671
00:50:44,760 --> 00:50:49,640
 So you you will know what this is. It's that little plastic wall plug that you you drill a hole

672
00:50:49,640 --> 00:50:53,160
 You stick the plug in the hole and then you can put a screw in

673
00:50:53,160 --> 00:50:55,160
 And it means you can hang things off a wall

674
00:50:55,160 --> 00:50:57,720
 Which you couldn't if you just shoved a screw in because screws don't work like that

675
00:50:57,720 --> 00:51:00,520
 This man is a hero

676
00:51:00,600 --> 00:51:05,480
 He I just think he's great and I didn't really realize that had been invented by someone but it was it was by him

677
00:51:05,480 --> 00:51:09,880
 Does he have any is that his only one have you read the full 1100? I haven't I've read a few more

678
00:51:09,880 --> 00:51:16,360
 I've read a few I read a couple of obituaries. So he also he also invented. I like these two edible building blocks for very young children

679
00:51:16,360 --> 00:51:19,080
 So just in case they try to eat

680
00:51:19,080 --> 00:51:21,560
 It's like fraggle rock. Yeah

681
00:51:21,560 --> 00:51:26,280
 They just you can the diggers you've made they build all these buildings and the fraggles would just eat them

682
00:51:26,600 --> 00:51:31,960
 Exactly, exactly like that. I love fraggle rock. Don't worry. We're on the same page. My god. You've got Andy here to understand all your references

683
00:51:31,960 --> 00:51:34,600
 Thanks. He's had several of them today. Thank you for that

684
00:51:34,600 --> 00:51:36,200
 and the other

685
00:51:36,200 --> 00:51:43,080
 The other one of my things which is one of my favorites is a plastic egg holder which could be stretched to fit any standard size egg

686
00:51:43,080 --> 00:51:47,240
 Not wait for his extra large

687
00:51:47,240 --> 00:51:49,240
 So you can go from a goose to

688
00:51:49,240 --> 00:51:56,360
 Again, I think standard size probably means hens. Yeah, yeah, but I mean

689
00:51:56,520 --> 00:52:01,240
 What a thing was the world crying out for that. I wonder I've never found my egg cup is not sufficient

690
00:52:01,240 --> 00:52:05,800
 It's probably is probably lower down the list of his 1100. Yeah, that's really cool

691
00:52:05,800 --> 00:52:09,320
 Erica, have you ever used a puta? Oh, yes

692
00:52:09,320 --> 00:52:12,040
 I have and I use a puta a lot

693
00:52:12,040 --> 00:52:16,680
 Um, we have to be careful where we use the term puta because if any of you speak spanish

694
00:52:16,680 --> 00:52:22,280
 There's a very different meaning in spanish. Does it it's an insulting term for a lady

695
00:52:22,280 --> 00:52:24,600
 It's a lady of the night. Oh, of course

696
00:52:25,640 --> 00:52:30,280
 And so I when I was in hodorious and they're like, what are you getting your suitcase? And I'm like 13 putas

697
00:52:30,280 --> 00:52:33,960
 And they're like what and I'm like, yeah

698
00:52:33,960 --> 00:52:39,480
 And I give everyone their puta. What is a puta? It's an aspirator. So I and a follow-up question there

699
00:52:39,480 --> 00:52:45,080
 It enables us to suck up insects. You suck a straw thing and then the

700
00:52:45,080 --> 00:52:51,160
 Insect goes through another straw and into a box. Is that right? Kind of. Yeah. So it's nowadays when I when I was little

701
00:52:51,240 --> 00:52:56,920
 We didn't put gauze over the end. So if you were if you miss sucked, you would end up with spiders in your mouth

702
00:52:56,920 --> 00:53:00,520
 I only bring it up because it was invented by a guy called Frederick Poo's

703
00:53:00,520 --> 00:53:05,320
 Really named after him. Yeah, Frederick William Poo's

704
00:53:05,320 --> 00:53:08,200
 He's another one. Um, just for your information, Erica

705
00:53:08,200 --> 00:53:13,080
 Andy collects names of people that are verbs and Frederick Poo's is one short sentences

706
00:53:13,080 --> 00:53:16,600
 That's a sentence people. Yeah, Frederick Poo's. That's absolute slam dunk

707
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:23,880
 My my favorite author who wrote the book on the cow dunk community of invertebrates whose name is Peter Skidmore

708
00:53:23,880 --> 00:53:27,160
 Which always makes me giggle

709
00:53:27,160 --> 00:53:35,720
 Okay, that's it. That's all of our facts

710

 What is more important than that andy? Oh buying Erica's book. Yes, and Erica. What's it called metamorphosis?

724
00:54:27,240 --> 00:54:32,760
 How insects are changing our world make sure you put the last bit in otherwise you might get a kafka novella

725
00:54:32,760 --> 00:54:35,000
 Oh, yeah awesome. Ovid

726
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:39,080
 Ovid metamorphosis. I think that's metamorphosis technically, of course

727
00:54:39,080 --> 00:54:45,240
 And with that last incredibly productive correction, it's time to end the show. Thank you very much Erica. Thank you everybody. Thank you for listening. Goodbye
