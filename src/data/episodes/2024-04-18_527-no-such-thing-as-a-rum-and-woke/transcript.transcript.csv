00:00:00,00:00:06,"Hi everyone, welcome to this week's episode of no such thing as a fish where we were joined by the incredible"
00:00:06,00:00:09,Doctor Erica
00:00:09,00:00:13,McAllister now Erica has been on the podcast before so you might remember her
00:00:13,00:00:19,But if you don't the one thing you need to know is that she is an expert in flies
00:00:19,00:00:25,"Insects, I won't say creepy Carly's I won't say mini beast because I know Erica doesn't like that"
00:00:25,00:00:33,But she is essentially a senior curator at the Natural History Museum and an absolute legend in this office
00:00:33,00:00:39,"She is so enthusiastic about her subject, but also so funny so interesting"
00:00:39,00:00:45,We really really enjoyed making this show and the main thing I do need to tell you is that Erica has a book out
00:00:45,00:00:50,Her book is called metamorphosis how insects are changing our world
00:00:50,00:00:53,It's a lovely thing. I've got a copy of it right here
00:00:53,00:00:56,It's got loads of amazing pictures incredible stories
00:00:56,00:01:02,It's just a really really great object to own and obviously you'll learn a great deal about
00:01:02,00:01:10,Insects if you buy that book another thing to say is that the radio for show which spawned the book get it spawned
00:01:10,00:01:18,It's called metamorphosis how insects transformed our world that is currently available on BBC radio for if you Google radio for
00:01:18,00:01:24,"Erica McAllister you will find it. It's a great show, and it is full of amazing facts anyway"
00:01:24,00:01:30,Not much more to add join Club Fish if you haven't buy our books if you haven't blah blah blah blah blah
00:01:30,00:01:35,Let's get on with the show with dr. Erica McAllister and on with the podcast
00:01:36,00:01:55,Hello and welcome to another episode of no subs thing as a fish a weekly podcast coming to you from the QI offices in Hoban
00:01:55,00:02:00,"My name is Andrew Hunter Murray, and I'm here with Anna Tajinsky James Harkin and Erica McAllister"
00:02:00,00:02:04,And once again we have gathered around the microphones with our four favorite facts from the last seven days
00:02:04,00:02:09,"So in no particular order here. We go starting with fact number one, and that is Erica"
00:02:09,00:02:12,Some flies have tits on the inside
00:02:12,00:02:19,"It's on the inside. Yeah, I mean do they have to wear bras on the"
00:02:19,00:02:23,"Yeah, how do you type because it was tough enough to do off on the outside?"
00:02:23,00:02:28,"Actually, I just think it's an evolutionary advantage of them avoiding males groping them in public"
00:02:28,00:02:32,"Suddenly you think male flies are gropers. Oh, look at how many hands they have"
00:02:32,00:02:41,So it's it's okay take your head away from imagining loads of little mammary grounds on the inside
00:02:41,00:02:46,"But it's they have this kind of flat surface, and they've got no nipples. So it's it's like a big area"
00:02:46,00:02:49,But they do you give birth to live young?
00:02:49,00:02:55,"So they will instead of like shooting off hundreds of thousands of eggs. They've decided to actually, do you know what?"
00:02:55,00:02:57,Let's concentrate on raising one larvae
00:02:57,00:03:03,"And this yeah, I know that's unusual in place, right? It's unusual in insects. Ah"
00:03:03,00:03:09,"So we generally think of the mammals doing that, you know, let's let's actually look after just one and go for it"
00:03:09,00:03:12,Now this is in the super family hippo-bossoidia
00:03:12,00:03:17,And they include the things that people would have found on the outside of their bodies
00:03:17,00:03:20,"Yeah, and they include the things that people would have heard of like tetsi"
00:03:20,00:03:25,Um tetsi flies is no because tetsi means fly. Mm-hmm. It's another little fact
00:03:25,00:03:31,And what is amazing like the tetsi when she gets pregnant because she probably does get pregnant
00:03:31,00:03:35,The larvae when it's born can have a mass bigger than her
00:03:35,00:03:40,"Oh, oh, yeah, I've seen a video of them giving birth"
00:03:40,00:03:46,And it is remarkable because imagine having a baby and it's bigger than you first of all
00:03:47,00:03:49,It seems impossible
00:03:49,00:03:53,"How do they what do they then shrink as they get older? Otherwise, they just get bigger and bigger and bigger"
00:03:53,00:03:55,"They go through metamorphosis, remember?"
00:03:55,00:04:01,I forgot that it's not a video that they show fly nct because I like that idea
00:04:01,00:04:08,This is just to get you ready now if you light a lot of candles and play some nice music it won't be as bad as you think
00:04:08,00:04:10,But I mean
00:04:10,00:04:15,Do you look at her stomach before she gives birth her abdomen just looks like the radicchio cabbage?
00:04:15,00:04:18,"You know, it's really it's properly swell. It is absolutely"
00:04:18,00:04:26,"Engorged it's red. It's got these white veins all over it. It's just I mean, she only gives birth about three or four times"
00:04:26,00:04:33,I mean only is quite something I know. I think I would have given up after one. Yeah. Yeah. We're actually just going to say one and done
00:04:33,00:04:39,We've made a decision it's easy with the schools also. What a great way of putting me off a radicchio cabbage for
00:04:39,00:04:41,sorry
00:04:41,00:04:44,so one thing I read about the specifically the tetsi flies is that
00:04:45,00:04:50,The females get a lifetime's worth of sperm from mating once
00:04:50,00:04:54,And then they just use it bit by bit as they go they kind of hoard it
00:04:54,00:04:58,I suppose if you only have one child a lifetime supply of sperm is just one sperm
00:04:58,00:05:04,So so many insects do this and a lot of flies it's called a spermotheca and it's where they store sperm
00:05:04,00:05:09,They can get rid of sperm. They can replace sperm now. This might be a question that you can't answer
00:05:09,00:05:11,But I was really wondering this when reading about it
00:05:11,00:05:16,Um a really sad because presumably every shag is a one-night stand. So a bit of a shame there
00:05:16,00:05:21,"Um, yeah, but it's like in some of them only live for hours. There's not even like a night"
00:05:21,00:05:23,"Okay, fair enough for one minute stand"
00:05:23,00:05:26,"Um, but then when you've got all this sperm inside you you want to pick the best one"
00:05:26,00:05:32,"Do you know how like? Yeah, what's the mechanism where you've got sperm within you? No idea"
00:05:32,00:05:33,"No, no"
00:05:33,00:05:37,You're beginning to look at this because you've got this is cryptic female selection going on
00:05:37,00:05:38,So this is all quite exciting
00:05:38,00:05:43,"So the victorians had this whole thing about oh, it's always about the males the males this the males choose blah blah blah"
00:05:43,00:05:48,"And it's like, okay back off. We know this is not the case. We can see it in our own sex"
00:05:48,00:05:52,So we're looking at the biochemistry now. We're looking at the hormones. We're looking at that
00:05:52,00:05:57,So her body is trying to kill sperm. His sperm is trying to drug her
00:05:57,00:06:02,It's all sorts of things going on. Why is her body trying to kill because her body wants the best
00:06:02,00:06:06,So she kills off all the weaklings only the best kids. How does she die?
00:06:07,00:06:10,We don't know. What was the other thing about them poisoning?
00:06:10,00:06:12,"Oh, yeah, the males drug the females"
00:06:12,00:06:17,"Yeah, so his sperm is going to have a load of pheromones in loads of different chemicals"
00:06:17,00:06:24,"And so with Drosophila, we know that immediately they've had sex the sperm makes the female less likely to have sex again"
00:06:24,00:06:28,So they are trying there's lots of sneaky behavior going on
00:06:28,00:06:35,Some of these flies they said the bat flies which I really love so I spend a lot of time running after bats in the Caribbean
00:06:35,00:06:37,She's nice
00:06:37,00:06:42,The female when she gets pregnant some of them undertake some extreme morphological adaptations at this point
00:06:42,00:06:47,So there's one that when she gets pregnant she rips her legs off and she rips her wings off
00:06:47,00:06:52,And then she sticks her head into the back and basically most of her body she undergoes
00:06:52,00:06:57,This complete metamorphosis. What does she rip off her last two legs with?
00:06:57,00:07:00,"Well, she's still I guess she's like she's sort of ripped her wings off first"
00:07:00,00:07:03,She's learned that the legs they can break them
00:07:03,00:07:08,So I presume she's breaking them off but mother nature's sort of a lovely solution
00:07:08,00:07:12,So she can stick her head in but she invaginates herself like she kind of I beg your pardon
00:07:12,00:07:15,She kind of wrapped her abdomen
00:07:15,00:07:18,"Invaginates, she kind of goes like I've invaginated meaning sheaf"
00:07:18,00:07:22,So she kind of like draws herself into her own body like pulling herself into a sleeping bag
00:07:22,00:07:27,"Yeah, well what a chat up line. I've never got a fanciest spot of invagination"
00:07:27,00:07:30,I think that rides yourself out of the picture in that
00:07:33,00:07:38,You mentioned you were running around chasing bats in Barbados and I've tried to catch two bats in my life inside rooms to get them out
00:07:38,00:07:40,And it's extremely difficult
00:07:40,00:07:46,How do you what are you doing just leaping along beach luxury beaches after bats in the dark?
00:07:46,00:07:50,"No, no, it was in Dominica and we have uh mist nets"
00:07:50,00:07:56,"So have you ever seen uh mist nets catching birds? No, obviously you lot have never done holidays like I do"
00:07:57,00:08:03,So you've ever been this net and a bat comes flying into it and male bats and then really obviously male bats
00:08:03,00:08:07,These two giant testicles are straight in your face
00:08:07,00:08:10,And you're holding them open because you're you're trying to weigh them sex them
00:08:10,00:08:15,Speciate them and then I'm the little entomologist next to trying to find these little bat flies
00:08:15,00:08:18,So they look like little drunk spiders running all over the bats
00:08:18,00:08:22,So they're visible enough as in you can see them without a whip or a scat they're big enough
00:08:22,00:08:23,And they're like
00:08:23,00:08:28,They're running around and they annoy the bats because they've got parasites. I don't know because the bat's so angry at this day
00:08:28,00:08:31,I don't know what's annoying. Someone's measuring his testicles
00:08:31,00:08:34,So there's a lot going on
00:08:34,00:08:39,Sort of parasites the size of your own thumb just running around your body. I'm guessing they're bigger than these things
00:08:39,00:08:45,"Oh great. Okay, fab. There's a whole lot of interesting things. There's a group of flies that are slightly different"
00:08:45,00:08:47,These are called bee riders and they hang around honeybees
00:08:47,00:08:52,They will go down and feed around the mouth of say the queen which they are often on
00:08:52,00:08:56,And these have mimicked her smell. So the queen knows that something
00:08:56,00:09:01,"This is bit running around on her. There's other creature, but it smells like her"
00:09:01,00:09:07,"So she thinks it's herself. She's like, is that is that me? I don't know, but it literally is imagine your head running around your body"
00:09:07,00:09:10,Like going
00:09:10,00:09:15,Pardon a minute. What is that Anna? Did that answer your question of how to catch a bat? Thank you. Yes
00:09:15,00:09:22,"Sorry, perfect. It would be cool if you if you had a beard which you get crumbs in other beard mites that"
00:09:22,00:09:24,Can eat the food
00:09:24,00:09:29,"Oh, yeah, really get crumbs in your eyelashes. Do you and there's obviously other things?"
00:09:29,00:09:33,"Again, you don't get crumbs there either. I think some people get crumbs"
00:09:33,00:09:37,I do there's a lot of feasting in bed. Okay
00:09:37,00:09:44,There's a custard cream down here
00:09:44,00:09:47,Does this hob not been imaginative?
00:09:49,00:09:53,Sorry. Sorry. Sorry. Let's talk about flies
00:09:53,00:09:57,"A negative about flies because I know you're a fan, but tetsy flies"
00:09:57,00:10:03,"Are quite big disease spreaders and it's well, you're making a you're making a face like maybe they're not well"
00:10:03,00:10:08,"I mean, it's it's not the tetsy's fault again. It's the same. Well, no, it's not because they are vectors"
00:10:08,00:10:10,They're being manipulated by this trapanosome
00:10:10,00:10:17,"Again, and they are their behavior is altered if they have this within them if they have the trapanosome is a parasite"
00:10:17,00:10:24,"Yeah, so it causes them to go into environments and you know and feed for longer feed earlier and do all of this"
00:10:24,00:10:26,So there is manipulation going on with the parasite
00:10:26,00:10:35,"Of course, it's not the parasite's fault either. You're always advocating for the poor flies. Those poor tetsy flies killing millions and millions of people"
00:10:35,00:10:37,"Well, I know and I'm not I'm not taken away from that"
00:10:37,00:10:42,But also there has been a case that tetsy has helped massively with conservation
00:10:42,00:10:47,Because we couldn't go into certain areas. We couldn't take livestock in certain areas
00:10:47,00:10:49,We left all of it
00:10:49,00:10:55,So some of the original national parks in southern Africa were set up because it was like there's nothing we could do with the land
00:10:55,00:11:01,The indigenous animals were fine because they're like they've got you know skin so thick the tetsy's were
00:11:01,00:11:07,"Not doing that. So yes, so there is a case of tetsy. It's very nice. Um, here's an attempt to deal with tetsy flies"
00:11:07,00:11:10,This is quite a clever one. It's what Zimbabwe did in the 1980s. I didn't know this
00:11:10,00:11:13,"There are 60,000 fake cows across Zimbabwe"
00:11:13,00:11:15,which
00:11:15,00:11:18,You can't tell you can't tell really. I bet I could
00:11:18,00:11:24,Depends on how destined you are. Is it like where they take one of those mobile phone masks and try and make it look like a tree?
00:11:24,00:11:27,It's exactly like that. And actually it just looks like a green mobile phone mask
00:11:27,00:11:32,It's exactly that except you're trying to lure people into the mobile phone mask to give them a shock to blast
00:11:32,00:11:35,"Basically, they have these kaira moons. I hope I'm pronouncing all right"
00:11:35,00:11:40,These are chemicals that tetsy flies love and they lure them in and then they kill them with insecticide because the cow
00:11:40,00:11:43,These fake cows also ooze insecticide in some way that I don't fully understand
00:11:44,00:11:47,"Um, but they brought cases down to almost zero in Zimbabwe"
00:11:47,00:11:53,So we we we tether cows often um and put nets over them too because they are really good lures
00:11:53,00:11:58,"And and so we yeah, so there's various different, um sampling methods using that"
00:11:58,00:12:02,They've done this with rabbits chickens all sorts put them in boxes chickens head poking out
00:12:02,00:12:05,Yeah
00:12:05,00:12:07,"Human bait, which is another way we do it"
00:12:07,00:12:11,Have you stood in the middle of a net with arms out?
00:12:12,00:12:16,"People I know have really and so yeah, so it's human bait. So every every hour"
00:12:16,00:12:20,"They will stick their hand out and let all the mosquitoes feed on them. Oh, yeah"
00:12:20,00:12:24,"They would do this. Can I ask Erica? Um, I'm one of the people who when I go on holiday"
00:12:24,00:12:28,I get bitten really really badly and my wife doesn't so
00:12:28,00:12:35,These people who are the human baits. Do you look for people like me to do it as in are you looking for people?
00:12:35,00:12:39,"Who are just people who would taste it? No, I think we just ask and hope that someone does it"
00:12:39,00:12:41,Right
00:12:41,00:12:45,Someone to lure in the incredibly rare north african penis bite who flies
00:12:45,00:12:50,Funny you should say that
00:12:50,00:12:55,So there's new world screw worm they all it was awful this guy went to venezuela to visit his family there
00:12:55,00:13:00,And he got back to the got back to the uk. This is a horrible story. Do you want me to carry on please?
00:13:00,00:13:05,"Okay, it's our favorite kind. Okay got back to the uk and it's obviously moaning and new world screw worm"
00:13:05,00:13:11,You can have multiple infestation of the maggots. Okay. And is that a screw worm because it screws its way into your body?
00:13:11,00:13:13,"Um, yeah"
00:13:13,00:13:19,"His screw infestation of which he had multiple was in his scrotum. Oh, no"
00:13:19,00:13:22,Now he's led this
00:13:22,00:13:25,Fester as it were for a couple of weeks
00:13:25,00:13:32,"Now at this point these maggots you're busy. You can't get a gp's appointment. No, that's saying. Can you do three in the afternoon?"
00:13:32,00:13:34,It might sort itself out
00:13:34,00:13:37,"Well, they eventually will because they were popped out by themselves"
00:13:37,00:13:41,But you have to put up with a writhing maggot maggot discomfort in your scrotum
00:13:41,00:13:47,If I googled that and it was like it will eventually cure itself. I can imagine being the kind of person so lazy
00:13:47,00:13:50,"I'd be like, you know, I'll deal with it. I just don't think you would now. I'm not a male"
00:13:50,00:13:54,So I do not have them but I think if my scrotum was moving by itself
00:13:54,00:14:00,I would be tempted to do something about it. Can I ask question? Did his scrotum still smell like him?
00:14:00,00:14:02,I did know that was obviously
00:14:02,00:14:06,I don't think that was written in the side
00:14:06,00:14:11,"They do they don't move exactly by themselves, but they're certainly what do you mean?"
00:14:11,00:14:15,They move more than the rest of you if I'm running and then I stop
00:14:15,00:14:18,It keeps running
00:14:18,00:14:24,That's when Andy runs the 100 meters. He actually only runs the 99.98 meters
00:14:24,00:14:27,It's not dead. I get over the line that way. Yeah
00:14:28,00:14:35,"Actually on genitals, can I ask a question about fly genitals generally because I have struggled to find"
00:14:35,00:14:42,The definite answer to this. I was reading an article from new scientists in 1990 about how all flies when they have sex
00:14:42,00:14:48,Their penises the male flies their penises rotate either 180 or 360 not all of them
00:14:48,00:14:51,"Okay, but some of them do. Yes. So it sounded very interesting and cool"
00:14:51,00:14:59,So when I rear mosquitoes when the adult males have hatched we leave them for 24 hours because their genitalia has to rotate 360 degrees
00:14:59,00:15:01,To be in the correct position. Yes. Yeah
00:15:01,00:15:07,Wait a minute because if it rotates it's not in one it doesn't just do that it moves down around
00:15:07,00:15:10,It's not like the hand of a clock
00:15:10,00:15:13,But it does wrap itself internally around their other organs
00:15:13,00:15:18,I think you know there's a lot of rapids going on but not all of them rotate and you can see this because some of them will
00:15:19,00:15:26,"Copulate in a missionary, you know or doggy style as it were fly style and others a female would drag the male along behind her"
00:15:26,00:15:32,"Okay, so that depends on how much genital rotation has gone on but also that's fixed rotation"
00:15:32,00:15:38,There is temporary rotation so they can move their penis into position like during sex
00:15:38,00:15:41,"Yes, I think I'm saying this and what I've really liked is an explanation of maybe why"
00:15:41,00:15:45,It allows you to be a bit more flexible in the same way that a balloon animal
00:15:46,00:15:52,If you if you've got a little long balloon and then you rotate it 360 like a magician would when he's making it into an animal
00:15:52,00:15:58,"Right, suddenly that you've got strength there in that twist in the middle and you've got flexibility"
00:15:58,00:16:02,"I quite like that. No, no, no, no, but this is a runaway evolution"
00:16:02,00:16:08,"So there's some flies that have a penis that is just extraordinary. It's like a massive curly whirly and you're like, whoa"
00:16:08,00:16:12,So she's evolving internally. He's trying to do all these crazy stuff
00:16:12,00:16:16,"So her body parts running away from his body parts. I mean basically, yes"
00:16:16,00:16:21,I'm I'm now thinking all the things that I'm I'm off radicchio cabbages
00:16:21,00:16:24,off curly ways
00:16:24,00:16:27,Two of my major food groups
00:16:27,00:16:36,"Okay, it's time for fact number two and that is Anna"
00:16:36,00:16:43,My fact this week is that the oldest rum brand in the world was founded by a man named cumberbatch soba
00:16:43,00:16:46,ironic
00:16:46,00:16:51,I've never heard cumberbatch as a first name. Sorry to completely distract from the sober element. No
00:16:51,00:16:55,Cumberbatch was a crucial part of the fact as well me neither. I'll be honest
00:16:55,00:17:01,"I'd never heard of it as a surname until Benedict cumberbatch came along point. Yeah, it is a relatively uncommon name. Yeah"
00:17:01,00:17:06,"Yeah, it's a funny word cumberbatch. Um, anyway, this is um, this is mount gay rum"
00:17:06,00:17:10,And it's probably been producing rum since 1663
00:17:10,00:17:15,It was and I've sort of cheated on this fact because it was originally called mount gilboa
00:17:15,00:17:19,And then it was taken over by the sober family
00:17:19,00:17:23,And they put someone in charge called a sir john gay
00:17:23,00:17:28,Alain to manage it and to manage the distillery a gay rum became the biggest rum in the world an amazing business
00:17:28,00:17:31,And so when sir john died
00:17:31,00:17:32,um
00:17:32,00:17:38,John sober's son cumberbatch renamed mount gilboa mount gay and that's what we get mount gay rum
00:17:38,00:17:43,So he named it. I have seen that mount gay rum for sale and never realized it was the oldest
00:17:43,00:17:47,"That's quite cool. Yeah weird names. A lot of them. There's pussers rum, which I like"
00:17:47,00:17:53,And mount gay. They're all sorts of eccentric names. You can get an extraordinary variety of strength in rum
00:17:53,00:18:00,Didn't realize the strongest rum in the world. I think is one called rude to your parents rum
00:18:01,00:18:07,"It's uh, it's not really an official rum. You can't really get it unless you go deep into jamaica and ask the right people"
00:18:07,00:18:11,But a journalist tracked it down and it's 160 proof. So 80 percent
00:18:11,00:18:18,"Rum john has said he sniffed it and almost passed out. Yeah, can you even I mean, that's what we're preserving insects"
00:18:18,00:18:22,"Yeah, I mean, this is like, is that really that as well?"
00:18:22,00:18:26,I don't think we know where rum comes from for sure the word rum because there was a
00:18:26,00:18:31,"Drink called rumbulian rumbulian, which was made from boiling sugar cane stalks"
00:18:31,00:18:34,Which is the leading theory and that sounds pretty convincing to be honest
00:18:34,00:18:42,"But um, there was also pirate drink called bumbo, which I really like nice. Yeah. Yeah, but definitely came from the caribbean, right?"
00:18:42,00:18:47,"Yeah, and it was from sugar plantation owners who had this kind of molasses which was left over"
00:18:47,00:18:54,Black sticky stuff and they would add water to it and then leave it for ment and and it became rum
00:18:54,00:18:56,"Yeah, but I read in greg jenis book"
00:18:56,00:19:03,"Um, which is a million years in a day that they would add dead animals or human urine"
00:19:03,00:19:11,To their wash so you go to preserve them as erica says was it entomologists to preserve your urine
00:19:11,00:19:14,"Think you're preserving the dead animals, but yeah"
00:19:14,00:19:15,What's that?
00:19:15,00:19:22,Apparently the idea is that it would stop the enslave people who are working on your plantation from drinking all of your rum
00:19:23,00:19:25,But you then have to drink dead rat rum. What would it remind me?
00:19:25,00:19:29,"When you're selling it, you don't advertise the fact that there's been dead animals and urine in it"
00:19:29,00:19:35,Or perhaps it was a story that you told the people so that they didn't drink it and in actual fact you didn't do that
00:19:35,00:19:41,"If your rum is strong enough, I mean I'll drink it. Yeah, me too. Yeah, as if that's going to put you off. Yeah, exactly"
00:19:41,00:19:48,"I mean my plantation and we drink a lot of light tequila, you know, although the worm is only a recent thing, isn't it?"
00:19:48,00:19:50,"Yeah, the bottles have a little worm in them. Well, they don't all"
00:19:51,00:19:54,I don't know and I think that could actually be a recent thing
00:19:54,00:19:58,"Oh, really? So yeah, so and we're not even sure why they did it in the first place"
00:19:58,00:20:01,Just one guy had a lot of spare ones in his scrotum
00:20:01,00:20:08,"Do you know what I've been handed um, my friend went walking and found a load of ticks all over him"
00:20:08,00:20:10,So he had a tiny little whiskey bottle
00:20:10,00:20:16,So he it's now in whiskey and I can't have an ad I haven't had the heart to put it in the collection because it looks so cute
00:20:16,00:20:21,And his only label he had on him was a plaster. So it's handwritten a plaster
00:20:21,00:20:26,Where on his body it was where he collected it in this little miniature of whiskey. So he's preserved it in that
00:20:26,00:20:32,How late and desperate into the night would it be before you decided that this was the last drink in the house?
00:20:32,00:20:35,"Yeah, I've got a lot of those bottles"
00:20:35,00:20:38,"Um, can I tell you a bit about navy rum?"
00:20:38,00:20:42,So this was the big thing in the Royal Navy. It was all sailors got a tot of rum every day
00:20:42,00:20:46,"And in fact, it wasn't a tot it was about half a pint a day of rum"
00:20:47,00:20:52,"And this was you know, this was great. And then until in the 17 in 1740"
00:20:52,00:20:55,It was watered down from that point on with like by one to five
00:20:55,00:20:59,"So you did get your rum still half a pint, but it was watered down with two pints of water"
00:20:59,00:21:04,"So it's a bit okay. So you were getting two and a half pints worth of stuff. Were you? Yeah, it was called grog"
00:21:04,00:21:08,And basically if you were a senior officer
00:21:08,00:21:11,You were allowed to drink your rum neat because you were probably a trustworthy chap
00:21:11,00:21:15,And if you were on the rest of the ship and able semen
00:21:15,00:21:21,"Exactly untrustworthy. You'd go on a bender. Maybe you'd save it all up and that you'd you know, and you'd like steer the ship wrong"
00:21:21,00:21:23,"Anyway, so they had a watered down"
00:21:23,00:21:29,"Um, and basically this is the amazing ritual they had the officer of the day the master of tarms the supply petty officer and the butcher"
00:21:29,00:21:31,"No, I don't know what he's doing here"
00:21:31,00:21:34,They meet at the ship spirit room. They unlock it
00:21:34,00:21:40,The butcher inserts his pump into the bunghole and I'm sorry. What come on steady on
00:21:40,00:21:44,He imaginates the
00:21:45,00:21:50,He draws off the ration which is then transferred to a small breaker which is spelled barico
00:21:50,00:21:53,But pronounced breaker. So that's then padlocked and then carried to the rum tub
00:21:53,00:21:57,At which point you've got the rum tub is now full of the day's rum
00:21:57,00:22:01,Then the rum call is sounded on bugle everyone gathers and you know
00:22:01,00:22:04,Then each mess like a little like let's say the four of us would be a mess
00:22:04,00:22:07,We would nominate a mess man. Let's say James is the mess man
00:22:07,00:22:13,James goes up gets the rum for all of us carries it back in his rum fanny
00:22:14,00:22:16,Which
00:22:16,00:22:18,That is the imagination
00:22:18,00:22:21,There's a large egg-shaped container for for our mess's rum
00:22:21,00:22:25,"Right, and then while we're drinking it we sing a special song called Nancy Dawson"
00:22:25,00:22:29,"Oh, yeah, I know the Nancy Dawson song. I think I might have mentioned it before actually"
00:22:29,00:22:35,Maybe we have but I think it is the same tune as here we go around the mulberry bush
00:22:35,00:22:39,"Oh, okay, and it was about a famous sex worker called Nancy Dawson"
00:22:40,00:22:44,And every sort of every verse is ruder and ruder than the last one
00:22:44,00:22:49,I've got to learn that version of the mulberry bush. I'm very bored of singing the other one
00:22:49,00:22:52,"Um, do you know why it's called grog? I didn't know this"
00:22:52,00:22:58,"Um, but it's because for international listeners grog is sort of what we call general alcohol now quite often"
00:22:58,00:23:00,"Oh, yeah, we do grog. Yeah"
00:23:00,00:23:03,"You know, not if you're of a certain age perhaps"
00:23:03,00:23:06,Living the deep deep countryside
00:23:06,00:23:09,You don't get many orders in the sort of london cocktail bars
00:23:09,00:23:11,I frequent for a glass of grog
00:23:11,00:23:14,for 12 pounds
00:23:14,00:23:18,"Gin and tonic, uh, a half of here's my rum fanny"
00:23:18,00:23:23,And then around of here we get around the Nancy Bush order
00:23:23,00:23:30,"No, it's because as Andy said in 1740 the rum was watered down because people were a bit worried that"
00:23:30,00:23:32,sailors were getting out of control or being responsible
00:23:32,00:23:39,And it was watered down diluted by a chap called Admiral Vernon who was an admiral and he wore this big
00:23:39,00:23:43,"Cloak, which was made of a special fabric that happened to be called grog rum"
00:23:43,00:23:48,So people used to call him old grog and that's one of those nice etymologies where we just know it comes from there
00:23:48,00:23:52,"Yeah, because it sounds fake, but it's not fake. Yeah, I mean he just wore this cloak"
00:23:52,00:23:56,They called him old grog so they called drinks grog and we do to this day in some parts of the country
00:23:56,00:23:58,Did you know what grog blossom is?
00:23:58,00:24:01,"No, is it have a punt?"
00:24:01,00:24:05,"I think you already know it. I do know it. Yeah, is it also to do with Admiral Vernon?"
00:24:05,00:24:13,"Did he have the case of genital warts or something? No, it's higher up. Okay, it is a bodily condition. It's even higher"
00:24:13,00:24:16,"Higher than your nipples. Yeah, strike north. Is it your nose?"
00:24:16,00:24:23,"It's your nose and your cheeks basically. Your countenance. Oh, that makes sense. It's the ruddy red"
00:24:23,00:24:28,"It's all where the blood vessels have sort of, you know, given up the ghost if you've been drinking a lot for a long time"
00:24:28,00:24:31,"Yes, yeah, exactly. Is that?"
00:24:31,00:24:37,"It's engrossed that, isn't it? Grosses dictionary. I read grosses dictionary for some other rum words because"
00:24:37,00:24:43,"Like we were talking before the mics came on about whether we say the word rum to mean, you know, like he's a rum bugger"
00:24:43,00:24:48,We would say in bolton for instance dodgy rum. I'd say that's a bit run. Yeah
00:24:48,00:24:53,"I wouldn't use it. Yeah, but you would say rum in that sense to mean bad, right? Kind of a bit dodgy"
00:24:53,00:24:58,"Yeah, yeah, but it did used to mean more like good like rum. Oh, that's you know"
00:24:58,00:25:01,So your rum peepers would be very expensive glasses
00:25:01,00:25:07,You mean you mean spectacles? Spectacles. Yeah. Yeah. Rum draws. Do you know what they were?
00:25:07,00:25:13,E-R-A-W-E-R-S. They're where you smuggle your rum out of the rum shop in your drawers
00:25:13,00:25:17,"Another word we use in the countryside. Yeah. Well, you're using the right kind of drawers"
00:25:17,00:25:20,It's um silk or other fine stockings
00:25:20,00:25:25,Well known as rum drawers and uh rum gaggers. Do you know what a rum gaga was?
00:25:25,00:25:27,rum gaga
00:25:27,00:25:29,"Um, someone who can't hold their drink"
00:25:29,00:25:37,"No, it was someone who would tell wonderful stories of their sufferings at sea or when taken by the Algerians"
00:25:37,00:25:42,Have I had a nickel?
00:25:42,00:25:49,"Well, and they would they would tell these stories and they'd get your confidence and then they would swindle you"
00:25:49,00:25:50,Oh
00:25:50,00:25:51,Rum gaggers
00:25:51,00:25:53,"Right, okay. I found a thing which is"
00:25:54,00:25:59,"Uh in your wheelhouse Erica, which is related to rum. Can you have a guess?"
00:25:59,00:26:04,"So related to insects we're thinking. Yeah, it's oh and all these things insects"
00:26:04,00:26:11,"Okay related to insects slash arachnids. It's certainly creepy crawly. Mini beasts. They call them. Oh, don't you see there are those terms?"
00:26:11,00:26:18,"Okay, I don't like either of them. I like mini beast. It's a bit. Well, it's a bit cutesy, but for children, it's still beast"
00:26:18,00:26:22,I see that's negative. I just think the negative word should be mini great guys
00:26:22,00:26:28,"Beast and I mean beasts are exciting. You know, we don't say big beasts. We don't so low. I do"
00:26:28,00:26:33,"Well, okay, we can play beast for a good thing and some beast"
00:26:33,00:26:36,Another one that we use alongside rum and crawl
00:26:36,00:26:40,In the wilds of Huntinghamshire
00:26:40,00:26:45,"Okay, I'll tell you it's the Isle of Rub. Yes. This has this is off Scotland"
00:26:45,00:26:48,"Yep, and it is home to the biggest something in the uk"
00:26:48,00:26:52,"Oh, this is it's got a huge population of red deer"
00:26:52,00:27:01,"Might it be a something that lives on a red deer? Well, uh, I'm very surprised because these are the largest worms in the uk"
00:27:01,00:27:09,Found on rum the Isle of Rum. They're three times bigger than your standard worm. It's basically like dune the Isle of Rum
00:27:09,00:27:11,It's like this huge
00:27:11,00:27:15,"Um these worms. Yeah, they're just worms. Are they are they different types?"
00:27:16,00:27:23,Just take that away. The earthworm specialist in the museum right now will be having kittens thinking about you saying just words
00:27:23,00:27:29,Just kittens. Are they common or garden worms? They are. They're standard earthworms. They're earthworms
00:27:29,00:27:33,But they the reason they've grown massive is that they I know holiday horses are a kid
00:27:33,00:27:39,They there are no predators. It's island gigantism. It's island gigantism. The soil is very fertile
00:27:39,00:27:42,scientists from the uni of central Lancashire have
00:27:42,00:27:45,They apparently discovered very large worm burrows
00:27:45,00:27:47,I don't know how large but they're big
00:27:47,00:27:53,It's like fantasy pretty much and they apparently they might be living for up to 10 years
00:27:53,00:27:59,And a normal worm lives two years on the mainland the natural predator of a worm. I would say is the early bird
00:27:59,00:28:05,"Do they not have birds on rum then well because it's it's further north, you know, it gets light later"
00:28:05,00:28:07,So the early bird can't see what it's doing
00:28:07,00:28:12,Do you know what's splicing the main braces? Is it where you have a rope and you cut it so that it?
00:28:13,00:28:16,That's why I always say it's very close to it. Is it what I thought splice?
00:28:16,00:28:20,"Yeah, you define it too. Basically these days it means give everyone aboard some rum a tot of rum"
00:28:20,00:28:24,But back in the day it meant something incredibly fiddly
00:28:24,00:28:28,Which then was so fiddly that everyone who'd done it deserved the extra tot of rum
00:28:28,00:28:33,The main brace is a piece of rope and it's the longest line in what they call the running rigging and the running rigging
00:28:33,00:28:39,Is what keeps the ship mobile. It's what means you can navigate basically as opposed to the standing rigging
00:28:39,00:28:45,Which is what keeps the mast in place right and the main brace is the longest and most complicated bit
00:28:45,00:28:50,It's the most fiddly changing job to do because it goes through all sorts of bits of wood and it's just you know
00:28:50,00:28:55,You have to oh god. It's just so so fiddly and so that's what that's what means it
00:28:55,00:28:57,That's what means it is it that's what means it
00:28:57,00:29:01,Sorry for using my nautical terms
00:29:01,00:29:05,"Yeah, so and that's what"
00:29:05,00:29:09,"Spliced the main brace now it's just a ceremonial thing, but originally it had a meaning of"
00:29:09,00:29:12,"Yeah, but they both it resulted in rum basically"
00:29:12,00:29:17,"So we should say that rum is no longer in the navy rations, but it lasted so due to woke"
00:29:17,00:29:19,"Whoa, indeed"
00:29:19,00:29:25,It lasted a bloody long time until 1970 and I was reading the hands-on debate the parliamentary debate for when it was abolished
00:29:25,00:29:27,And the outrage was palpable
00:29:27,00:29:31,MPs just standing up one after the other dr
00:29:31,00:29:38,Reginald bennett mp for gossport and ferrum saying I represent a constituency which has been plunged into gloom and horror by this
00:29:38,00:29:39,Iniquitous decision
00:29:39,00:29:45,So the reason it was abolished was because it was said that maybe their judgment in quite fiddly tasks at war could be impaired
00:29:45,00:29:47,Splicer than base brace
00:29:47,00:29:54,Could be impaired by having a rum ration and the answer is that no no well
00:29:54,00:29:57,We've used it and now my friend got bought flying his head. So we needed
00:29:57,00:30:01,We needed the rum for him for morale or for
00:30:01,00:30:04,His yeah to slightly anesthetize him
00:30:04,00:30:08,So when you split open is quite how deep so it embeds itself in your well
00:30:08,00:30:11,It doesn't because it because of your skull. He just goes along so you can see it growing
00:30:11,00:30:16,"If you just leave it will it get better? Yeah. Oh, um, there's this beautiful guy"
00:30:16,00:30:20,Gil he's he did a study of his own bot fly
00:30:20,00:30:24,And so he's got all the photos and then he's got the adult winner hatched out
00:30:24,00:30:26,That's like an entomological dream
00:30:26,00:30:29,Because it's been part of you
00:30:29,00:30:32,We really became a foster parent. So he's quite pleased
00:30:32,00:30:37,"I mean, it's it's a bit upsetting apparently if you get bought flight at night because you can hear it"
00:30:37,00:30:38,"Oh, wow"
00:30:38,00:30:43,"And if you around yours, it's cool. Well, I don't move around. It's so but what do you hear it doing?"
00:30:43,00:30:45,Um eating and defecating
00:30:45,00:30:49,So it's just like you're asleep and he's going
00:30:49,00:30:55,I'd give that a minute
00:30:55,00:30:57,Okay
00:30:57,00:31:08,It's time for fact number three and that is james. Okay. My fact this week is that the amazon rainforest is man made
00:31:08,00:31:12,"No, not having it. What's it? Is it sort of a blast? It's all plastic. Yeah"
00:31:12,00:31:15,It's all mobile phone masks
00:31:15,00:31:23,So I bring this up because erica's just come back from the amazon but the basic argument is
00:31:24,00:31:29,That the amazon's home to 16 000 trees a species of tree
00:31:29,00:31:34,But 227 of them cover more than half of the forest ecosystem
00:31:34,00:31:39,Which is suggestive of people deliberately planting them in certain places
00:31:39,00:31:43,And there seems to be two distinct layers of soil in the forest
00:31:43,00:31:49,The bottom layer is kind of the normal stuff you find around there which has got quite poor fertility
00:31:49,00:31:55,"But then there's a top layer called terra preta, which is like some kind of super soil that's made with"
00:31:55,00:31:59,Like burnt charcoal and stuff. So it's as if humans have made that
00:31:59,00:32:03,And the more kind of deforestation we do
00:32:03,00:32:05,Thank god we're doing this deforestation
00:32:05,00:32:11,Because we find evidence of farming societies of human structures of artifacts
00:32:11,00:32:17,And even recently they've been doing laser technology from the air and they're finding earth and mounds hidden
00:32:17,00:32:22,And lots of what they think are ancient roads that go in between all these places where people lived
00:32:22,00:32:27,And there is a historical evidence that when europeans first arrived there
00:32:27,00:32:29,They said that lots of people were living there
00:32:29,00:32:36,"And now of course very very few people live there. So that's the argument. I buy it. Yeah, I absolutely buy it"
00:32:36,00:32:43,"Well, you know, it seems when I wedged this I was like, oh, so I went back to all the primary sources and I was like, oh"
00:32:44,00:32:51,"Uh, the thing is they do make a valid point. Yeah to say that the amazon is man made. However"
00:32:51,00:32:53,"I mean, no, there probably would have been something there"
00:32:53,00:33:00,"They probably would have been lots of trees in this area even if people hadn't so we wish but yeah, you're shaping some of the"
00:33:00,00:33:05,Is a nice way of saying it because these species we didn't make these species. No
00:33:05,00:33:12,So we are manipulating the environment to that extent nothing is man made even this building we're in now because it's all
00:33:12,00:33:15,"Okay, that's I think about these are secondary and tertiary"
00:33:15,00:33:19,But when it comes to the actual species if we're just manipulating them along the way like that
00:33:19,00:33:21,I think the amazon is man manipulated
00:33:21,00:33:28,"Yeah, I mean maybe so they it was quite extensive as well. So they did over a thousand plots"
00:33:28,00:33:33,"Yeah, and quite far apart. So what to test to test. Yeah, it's so cool. Yeah"
00:33:33,00:33:38,There's an the area of this soil the terra preta is twice the size of great britain
00:33:38,00:33:42,"Uh, it's got lots of fish bones and seeds in it. They basically burned it to produce charcoal"
00:33:42,00:33:46,So this it's really fertile stuff. It's really good soil
00:33:46,00:33:51,And it dates from the last 2000 years this terra preta. I mean the argument against it is maybe there was a fire
00:33:51,00:33:57,And maybe then it was washed down by the amazon and blah blah blah. I mean that's just to say that's the right argument
00:33:57,00:34:03,I can't believe it. See we're all we're all now thinking and arguing like the amazon being partially man made is the more plausible explanation
00:34:03,00:34:05,But this layer it can be 12 feet thick
00:34:05,00:34:11,It's really thick and basically the I love the idea that basically the primary building material in the amazon was the soil
00:34:11,00:34:13,So it's not it's not built
00:34:13,00:34:18,I do think you've got to be careful by saying I mean there is
00:34:18,00:34:22,"Yes areas of it have been manipulated by humans, but I don't think me not the whole thing"
00:34:22,00:34:25,I just want to just take a plan a bit
00:34:25,00:34:30,But the reason it doesn't look like what we think of as a you know built environment is that so much
00:34:30,00:34:33,If you're moving large amounts of soil around it doesn't look like that to us
00:34:33,00:34:38,So um percy force at the explorer who went looking for the lost cities of the amazon great name. There is such a good name
00:34:38,00:34:42,There was a theory that when he came through you know on his travels
00:34:42,00:34:44,He may have walked through some of these sites
00:34:44,00:34:50,Which actually were the city he was looking for and not recognize them as that because he didn't know about this soil
00:34:50,00:34:57,Because they're not like western cities also wasn't he hoping to find a existing living city lots of bustling people trading hanging out
00:34:57,00:35:00,I don't think he was hoping to find a series of slightly raised
00:35:01,00:35:04,Black soil. He was hoping they would be made of gold rather than black soil
00:35:04,00:35:10,It just it seems almost inevitable because I really hadn't realized how many people were there um
00:35:10,00:35:15,In the amazon itself and the amazon rainforest when columbus arrived from 1492
00:35:15,00:35:18,So there were probably between eight and ten
00:35:18,00:35:23,"Million indigenous people living there, which is at least five times more than there are today living in the amazon"
00:35:23,00:35:28,"So when you've got millions and millions of people it makes sense. Of course, they're going to be sculpting things. It is very big"
00:35:29,00:35:32,It's large. Yes. So if you have eight million people there
00:35:32,00:35:37,I worked out that would give you a population density still less dense than mongolia
00:35:37,00:35:43,Which is the least dense big country in the world and about three times emptier than modern Australia
00:35:43,00:35:47,"Yeah, it's wildly big. Okay. Okay. I mean, it's still a lot of people"
00:35:47,00:35:50,It's always what scares me about going to it. The idea of getting lost
00:35:50,00:35:56,It's 28 times bigger than the uk just I can't I mean humans aren't very good at conceptualizing
00:35:56,00:36:02,"Space and it is huge. I just we were on the on a boat going across the amazon and this is like, you know"
00:36:02,00:36:05,This is not at the mouth. So this is really quite narrow
00:36:05,00:36:07,Where else were you what sir?
00:36:07,00:36:13,"In kitos in peru. So you're up, you know the other end you're not down in my house"
00:36:13,00:36:17,"You haven't got the the amazon that is fattest, but even still I'm like, oh my god"
00:36:17,00:36:19,The idea of a river being this wide
00:36:19,00:36:23,"You know, it's still I'm not used to it. I'm from the uk"
00:36:24,00:36:26,Wide than the tenson
00:36:26,00:36:31,"Because the tenson gets pretty wide if you go down, you know, doppelganger's way, it's wide"
00:36:31,00:36:38,"You can still see the other side. Yeah, that's true. You can't see the other side. No, there are bits. You can't. You're just like, this is amazing"
00:36:38,00:36:40,Holy moly. Do you even know then? How do you even know?
00:36:40,00:36:44,It sounds like you're on the coast
00:36:44,00:36:49,"But no, it was weird because we were a bit where there's all these different tributaries coming in and so there's one bit"
00:36:49,00:36:51,"You're just like, this is amazing, you know"
00:36:51,00:36:53,"Well, we did throw a tarantula in"
00:36:54,00:36:58,But it's all right because we were a tarantula. It wasn't on purpose and I didn't do it
00:36:58,00:37:02,"I'll have you notice but uh, it was one of the students panicked or a tarantula on him"
00:37:02,00:37:08,"And so she just threw it into the amazon and died. Look, it swam off. So luckily, yeah"
00:37:08,00:37:14,"I'm amazed tarantulas can swim and do they swim um, like an underwater breast milk? Crawl surely crawl"
00:37:14,00:37:20,"It's going to be more like the butterfly I presume. Yeah, okay. That's good. That's good like that"
00:37:20,00:37:25,"We should say about the amazon being partially man-made thing. Oh, yeah, it sounds like oh, you might take the implication that"
00:37:25,00:37:31,"Uh, oh, well, it's fine. What we're doing now then and what this was is this is people producing food in quite small batches"
00:37:31,00:37:35,"Yeah, they did have things like fish farms, but it was it was relatively sustainable"
00:37:35,00:37:39,Whereas what we have now is chopping down ancient forests to grow soy or raise cattle
00:37:39,00:37:45,"Which is really really really really unsustainable. Although in good news, which we don't get a lot"
00:37:45,00:37:50,In the prime world of climate change. It is getting better as in I mean
00:37:50,00:37:55,I don't think we make enough of a big deal about the fact that bolton arrow left power and lula came in
00:37:55,00:38:02,"Given the awful damage that he was doing. Yeah, you're looking skeptical, but there's no question that he's better"
00:38:02,00:38:08,"So deforestation in brazil has halved yeah, but in fact halved this is again see the figures"
00:38:08,00:38:11,It's still very bad. It's really bad. It's better than doubled as in the direct
00:38:12,00:38:16,"No, no, no, I mean, you're right. We have to be positive, but I still think we all need to we've got to stop it"
00:38:16,00:38:21,I think it's something like in the 80s the amount deforested globally per year was roughly the size of india
00:38:21,00:38:22,And now it's and now it's the size of switzerland
00:38:22,00:38:27,"It just shows how big it is that it's still some of it's still left, right? It's amazing"
00:38:27,00:38:31,"So we I'm going out there and we're looking for new species and we're doing all of this and it's still, you know"
00:38:31,00:38:37,I could just walk down this tiny little transect next to where I'm staying and knowing that I'm looking at new things to science
00:38:37,00:38:40,"And it's just so sad. We're kind of this, you know"
00:38:40,00:38:42,the pos the probability of life
00:38:42,00:38:46,Is so random and it's so odd the fact that I'm here and you're here
00:38:46,00:38:52,It's also random and all these different species and this is the only proven bit of life this planet
00:38:52,00:38:55,And yet we're hell bent on destroying it and it's like come on
00:38:55,00:39:00,It's it's an amazing thing. I caught okay. This is my favorite discovery of the amazon
00:39:00,00:39:04,"We caught this stick insect and my friend was like the woman who got it and she was like eric, what's that?"
00:39:04,00:39:10,"He's got an egg on it and I'm like, oh, it's this midge and this midge feeds on the veins"
00:39:10,00:39:14,Of the wings of this stick insect and it's engorged
00:39:14,00:39:19,It's engorged now imagine growing your abdomen to the size of this table
00:39:19,00:39:26,"You know, like mr. Creosote is the only thing I can think of that's but mr. Creosote would have to be four or five times bigger"
00:39:26,00:39:33,"To be this anyone else not no, I'm afraid I don't know that's a modi python sketch with the guy who's just had a huge great meal"
00:39:33,00:39:35,One more waffa thin meat. Oh waffa thin!
00:39:37,00:39:40,"But yeah, but it was amazing and this midge does it all around the planet"
00:39:40,00:39:42,And I'm working with this guy at the moment
00:39:42,00:39:47,And he's he's looking at all these migrating insects and some of them will latch on to a dragonfly
00:39:47,00:39:51,So the dragonflies can migrate in their masses on there
00:39:51,00:39:56,um migrating across continents and there's this little female midge
00:39:56,00:39:59,Cleaning on like feeding go whoo
00:39:59,00:40:01,What's going on here?
00:40:01,00:40:06,"And so it's like all of these little discoveries everywhere. Yeah. Oh, it does sound incredible"
00:40:06,00:40:10,I love it and some quite scary stuff some quite painful insects there
00:40:10,00:40:13,"I think they've got the most painful insect in the world the bullet ant. Yeah, um, which"
00:40:13,00:40:18,Is this painful as being shot hence the name 30 times more painful than a bee sting
00:40:18,00:40:21,But the satari maway people have this ritual though
00:40:21,00:40:25,I don't think we've mentioned before where boys from 12 onwards you have to gather them up
00:40:25,00:40:29,"You make gloves special bullet and gloves and you stuff your gloves full of them, don't you?"
00:40:29,00:40:31,And it's to sort of prove
00:40:31,00:40:34,"Well, I read a quite nice quote from a tribe chief"
00:40:34,00:40:40,Who said it's meant to show that a life without suffering or without any kind of effort isn't worth anything at all
00:40:40,00:40:43,To teach you that suffering
00:40:43,00:40:48,"Is a crucial part of being alive. Well, I suppose so. Yeah, it does feel like extra sort of bonus suffering though"
00:40:48,00:40:52,"Yeah, I mean it sounds like I'm a celebrity get me out"
00:40:52,00:40:56,"Well, actually Steve I did a podcast with Steve Batchel and he was saying he did that"
00:40:56,00:41:01,"So he does nature's dead leaves. Okay. And um, he was reduced to tears"
00:41:01,00:41:06,"It was the most he said it was extruded and he did the bullet and yeah, he did the bullet and you know"
00:41:06,00:41:12,"It's 13 14 year old boys generally and yeah, there's this growing man who's he's completely tough"
00:41:12,00:41:19,"And he was just but yeah, I feel like teenage boys can cope with a lot of uh, weird stuff"
00:41:30,00:41:35,"Okay, it's time for our final fact of the show that is my fact my fact is the man who invented the karaoke machine"
00:41:35,00:41:40,Also invented a device you could throw at robbers as they ran away. So they would be indelibly died
00:41:40,00:41:42,Oh
00:41:42,00:41:48,"That's that died. No, sorry. Sorry. You cover them in dye. Um, so this is a guy"
00:41:48,00:41:53,Who's called shigetchi negishi and he has just died
00:41:53,00:41:58,"And again, I'm using the died word to mean he's he's passed away this year aged 100"
00:41:58,00:42:03,He was born in 1923 amazing and he invented the karaoke machine
00:42:03,00:42:07,So japan had all these kind of early versions that were kind of approaching karaoke
00:42:07,00:42:08,And he was in the right place at the right time
00:42:08,00:42:13,He ran his own electronics firm basically and there was a radio show called pop songs without lyrics
00:42:13,00:42:17,"Which is quite karaoke-ish, you know, they just play the songs and then you can sing along"
00:42:17,00:42:21,and he was teased about his singing voice brutally by his boss and
00:42:21,00:42:26,He he was sad about that and he thought maybe it would sound better if he had a professional proper backing track
00:42:26,00:42:29,Behind him and so he wasn't just singing along to the radio
00:42:29,00:42:33,So he asked a colleague to hook up a microphone and he could hear himself singing then
00:42:33,00:42:37,Over the recording so rather than just him singing. He's hearing himself through the speakers
00:42:37,00:42:44,And that's what he set up and he called that the sparko box and that is basically the first karaoke machine
00:42:44,00:42:47,"Yeah, that's amazing. He's invented this this other thing as well"
00:42:47,00:42:54,So ironically the thing that's famous for revealing people's inability to sing was made by someone who wanted to improve his singing
00:42:54,00:42:59,"That was tragic. Yeah, and there was actually loads of people like you say who kind of claimed"
00:42:59,00:43:03,"Invention of the karaoke machine, right because it was of its time"
00:43:03,00:43:07,It was just like let you say there was this program on and lots of people doing it
00:43:07,00:43:12,There was another guy called Inui Daisuke and he had been he was a keyboard player
00:43:12,00:43:18,And people used to invite him around to play keyboard so they could sing because it would improve their performance
00:43:18,00:43:24,"And then so many people were asking him that he thought well, maybe I'll come up with a way of recording my"
00:43:24,00:43:27,Keyboard playing and then people can use that as a backing track
00:43:27,00:43:31,But he also invented a cockroach repellent
00:43:31,00:43:34,So he was also a double inventor
00:43:34,00:43:41,"It's so interesting. People. How did you repell cockroaches? Oh, that's a great question. He's in trouble now. No, it doesn't"
00:43:41,00:43:47,"I don't know is the answer. Um, but the problem was that his karaoke machines were getting infested by cockroaches"
00:43:47,00:43:49,I know it's not the cockroaches fault
00:43:50,00:43:54,"I know that they just like karaoke machines, but they would get inside build nests and chew on the wires"
00:43:54,00:43:57,Have you not seen joe's apartment?
00:43:57,00:44:01,Who's apartment joe's apartment is the film with the singing cockroaches
00:44:01,00:44:06,"No, no, it's this tenement building in new york and the guy moves in and the whole place is falling down"
00:44:06,00:44:10,"So the cockroaches all start helping each other, but they're always singing"
00:44:10,00:44:16,"So maybe that's why they were in the karaoke machines because they really liked it. No, it's pretty ratatouille"
00:44:16,00:44:21,"Yeah, it's like a it's like a much i'm sorry less cute version of ratatouille. I'm sorry"
00:44:21,00:44:26,Can I ask erica we would discuss him before the mites came on about
00:44:26,00:44:32,How if you read a book or watch a movie where it's not entomologically correct
00:44:32,00:44:36,"You don't enjoy it quite as much. Okay, right Jurassic park when it came out"
00:44:36,00:44:39,Okay
00:44:41,00:44:44,"Okay, there was no we we ignored the dinosaur bit. We just let that go"
00:44:44,00:44:49,But when they had old dicky with his little uh stave and it had the mosquito in it
00:44:49,00:44:52,The first scene of that is not a mosquito. It's a crane flower. No
00:44:52,00:44:59,"And I'm like, oh god, and then they do show a mosquito and it's a male and we're like no because males don't"
00:44:59,00:45:04,Click blood and and it's so big. We think actually it was the toxic iron kites
00:45:04,00:45:07,Which obviously you all know that even the females don't love feed
00:45:07,00:45:14,So we were like in entomological rage almost every film that you ever watch would have a fly or some sort of insects
00:45:14,00:45:21,"In the background even just flying around, right? So really every film should employ an entomologist just to make sure"
00:45:21,00:45:24,"Yeah, yeah, you come up with a website fly mdb. Yeah"
00:45:24,00:45:27,"Some movies, yeah"
00:45:27,00:45:33,"Fat karaoke. Oh, yeah quickly. Are you guys karaoke fans? I do. I love karaoke. Do you?"
00:45:34,00:45:38,"Well, no, I mean these days now that I have a child and no life. I don't do it so much"
00:45:38,00:45:40,But I certainly used to do it all the I used to do it every week
00:45:40,00:45:46,I've never invited arson to be honest. I'm okay with that me and jenny ryan from the chase. We used to do
00:45:46,00:45:53,"Yeah, yeah, we got asked in australia to leave a bar because we weren't respecting the karaoke. Oh really?"
00:45:53,00:45:56,"Yeah, what do you mean? Well, we were we were laughing too much"
00:45:56,00:46:02,"Um, it was very much will you go you were breaking into the machines getting the cockroaches out?"
00:46:02,00:46:06,We were just we were just not respecting because it is a really serious
00:46:06,00:46:10,They do take it very seriously in a lot of asian countries
00:46:10,00:46:13,And what I found really interesting is that it's particularly huge in japan
00:46:13,00:46:16,Of course it was invented and you know everyone still does it
00:46:16,00:46:22,And it's also very big in europe certainly and I think outside of asia is biggest in finland
00:46:22,00:46:26,And I was reading an article about this and lots of people said the same thing
00:46:26,00:46:29,Which is that both of them have populations that are quite reserved
00:46:30,00:46:34,Or the finland one was saying that finnish people tend to be quite reserved and a lot of the fins who love karaoke
00:46:34,00:46:38,Were saying it's kind of a way of going out without having to spontaneously communicate with each other
00:46:38,00:46:43,Because you can go out and you just have to do this other thing. I see you like doing a pub quiz. That's a very good
00:46:43,00:46:51,"I do like that kind of activity. There you go like a game one which replaces proper communication. Yeah, exactly"
00:46:51,00:46:54,What does karaoke mean? It means empty orchestra
00:46:54,00:46:59,And the term existed before uh mr. Negishi came up with his sparko box
00:46:59,00:47:04,It was an industry term and it was when singers went around the country to rural areas
00:47:04,00:47:07,They would sometimes not have an orchestra with them
00:47:07,00:47:13,So they would play with a just a tape like a tape backing them. They'd do the gig but the orchestra was empty
00:47:13,00:47:16,"Uh, it can be bad for you. Can it yeah 2019"
00:47:16,00:47:20,There was a man whose lung collapsed
00:47:20,00:47:25,Due to the high lung pressure caused by singing high notes according to the paper
00:47:26,00:47:31,There was a study in 2003 saying that people who sing regularly in this was in Korea
00:47:31,00:47:37,They have sounds higher than 95 decibels and it can cause hearing damage
00:47:37,00:47:41,Do you know what there's a
00:47:41,00:47:46,"Slightly off-track you're just talking about hearing damage. There's a uh, it's a micro nectar"
00:47:46,00:47:53,It's a tiny little water bug and it stridulates with its penis and thankfully it's in water because otherwise it's 99 decibels
00:47:54,00:47:56,Oh
00:47:56,00:48:01,Like an orchestra front row of an orchestra and that's nice. Is Mozart or my list?
00:48:01,00:48:05,"Well, I presume he's trying to be as nice as possible because we're trying to attract the ladies"
00:48:05,00:48:12,"So, yeah, wouldn't it be amazing if humans did that and that's what your orchestra was. Yeah, just the the string section"
00:48:12,00:48:22,"Um, but this is the thing about so mr. Negishi invented this thing but he invented lots of other stuff too and inventors frequently do"
00:48:23,00:48:29,"Yeah, they're inventing things kind of the way business people. It doesn't actually matter what the business is what they're good at is doing business"
00:48:29,00:48:32,You know what I mean and the inventors invent and that thing
00:48:32,00:48:33,I like they
00:48:33,00:48:38,"Can I drop the plug with the book because the whole yeah, so this right recent book is all about"
00:48:38,00:48:44,People looking at nature going do you know what that's amazing and let's think about how we can copy it
00:48:44,00:48:49,My favorite ones are like a maggot and they they're making tiny little nano robots
00:48:49,00:48:55,That look like maggots that can actually now go through your body some of the maggots. They're looking at um encapsulating medicine
00:48:55,00:48:59,"You know, they're they're being inspired by these things already there"
00:48:59,00:49:02,And I love the fact that people are looking at nature in a different way
00:49:02,00:49:06,So it's all different people some of them might be artists some of them might be you know engineers
00:49:06,00:49:10,Some of them are medics so lots and lots of different disciplines
00:49:10,00:49:12,And I think that's what's really great
00:49:12,00:49:15,Evolution has taken millions of years to get the insects to where they are
00:49:15,00:49:21,And we're just nicking it and we're just in the last minute coming in taking the glory. Have you got a favorite invention based on that?
00:49:21,00:49:27,I quite like our debridement therapy. So this is maggots eating necrotic flesh
00:49:27,00:49:31,"Oh, yeah. Yeah, I love that one and the fact that we can get it on the nhs"
00:49:31,00:49:36,"Can you can anyone get it? Yeah, great. I'll I'll ask well you have to bring your own necrotic flesh"
00:49:36,00:49:39,"I think you can't just say I'd like some maggots, please"
00:49:39,00:49:46,"No, and they come now in little like teabags. So because people get offended by maggots crawling around their flesh. I prefer loose leaf"
00:49:46,00:49:51,I read the other day that
00:49:51,00:49:54,"Fiennes fly traps, which you probably hate Erika because they eat flies"
00:49:54,00:49:58,But they will also eat human athlete's foot
00:49:58,00:50:02,Skin if you feed it to them someone tried it and it worked
00:50:02,00:50:07,But they won't you can't put your foot in and then pull it out an hour later and
00:50:08,00:50:11,"You mean like those fish that nibble? Yeah, exactly. Yeah"
00:50:11,00:50:15,"Your shopping center experience went really badly, didn't it?"
00:50:15,00:50:18,But no that is
00:50:18,00:50:23,"I think you'd need to wiggle it about because the trap won't close unless it thinks it's an insect, right?"
00:50:23,00:50:27,"So right, okay, you need to get a piece of athlete's foot skin off your foot"
00:50:27,00:50:31,"Wiggle it around so that it closes on it, but it will digest it and it will eat it"
00:50:31,00:50:33,Oh
00:50:33,00:50:39,"Beautiful. Um, can I send you my favorite inventor? Yeah, I'll tell Fisher. So he died in 2016"
00:50:39,00:50:41,He had 1100 patents to his name
00:50:41,00:50:44,And his main thing is the Fisher wall plug
00:50:44,00:50:49,So you you will know what this is. It's that little plastic wall plug that you you drill a hole
00:50:49,00:50:53,You stick the plug in the hole and then you can put a screw in
00:50:53,00:50:55,And it means you can hang things off a wall
00:50:55,00:50:57,Which you couldn't if you just shoved a screw in because screws don't work like that
00:50:57,00:51:00,This man is a hero
00:51:00,00:51:05,He I just think he's great and I didn't really realize that had been invented by someone but it was it was by him
00:51:05,00:51:09,Does he have any is that his only one have you read the full 1100? I haven't I've read a few more
00:51:09,00:51:16,I've read a few I read a couple of obituaries. So he also he also invented. I like these two edible building blocks for very young children
00:51:16,00:51:19,So just in case they try to eat
00:51:19,00:51:21,It's like fraggle rock. Yeah
00:51:21,00:51:26,They just you can the diggers you've made they build all these buildings and the fraggles would just eat them
00:51:26,00:51:31,"Exactly, exactly like that. I love fraggle rock. Don't worry. We're on the same page. My god. You've got Andy here to understand all your references"
00:51:31,00:51:34,Thanks. He's had several of them today. Thank you for that
00:51:34,00:51:36,and the other
00:51:36,00:51:43,The other one of my things which is one of my favorites is a plastic egg holder which could be stretched to fit any standard size egg
00:51:43,00:51:47,Not wait for his extra large
00:51:47,00:51:49,So you can go from a goose to
00:51:49,00:51:56,"Again, I think standard size probably means hens. Yeah, yeah, but I mean"
00:51:56,00:52:01,What a thing was the world crying out for that. I wonder I've never found my egg cup is not sufficient
00:52:01,00:52:05,"It's probably is probably lower down the list of his 1100. Yeah, that's really cool"
00:52:05,00:52:09,"Erica, have you ever used a puta? Oh, yes"
00:52:09,00:52:12,I have and I use a puta a lot
00:52:12,00:52:16,"Um, we have to be careful where we use the term puta because if any of you speak spanish"
00:52:16,00:52:22,There's a very different meaning in spanish. Does it it's an insulting term for a lady
00:52:22,00:52:24,"It's a lady of the night. Oh, of course"
00:52:25,00:52:30,"And so I when I was in hodorious and they're like, what are you getting your suitcase? And I'm like 13 putas"
00:52:30,00:52:33,"And they're like what and I'm like, yeah"
00:52:33,00:52:39,And I give everyone their puta. What is a puta? It's an aspirator. So I and a follow-up question there
00:52:39,00:52:45,It enables us to suck up insects. You suck a straw thing and then the
00:52:45,00:52:51,Insect goes through another straw and into a box. Is that right? Kind of. Yeah. So it's nowadays when I when I was little
00:52:51,00:52:56,"We didn't put gauze over the end. So if you were if you miss sucked, you would end up with spiders in your mouth"
00:52:56,00:53:00,I only bring it up because it was invented by a guy called Frederick Poo's
00:53:00,00:53:05,"Really named after him. Yeah, Frederick William Poo's"
00:53:05,00:53:08,"He's another one. Um, just for your information, Erica"
00:53:08,00:53:13,Andy collects names of people that are verbs and Frederick Poo's is one short sentences
00:53:13,00:53:16,"That's a sentence people. Yeah, Frederick Poo's. That's absolute slam dunk"
00:53:17,00:53:23,My my favorite author who wrote the book on the cow dunk community of invertebrates whose name is Peter Skidmore
00:53:23,00:53:27,Which always makes me giggle
00:53:27,00:53:35,"Okay, that's it. That's all of our facts"
