00:00:00,00:00:02,(upbeat music)
00:00:02,00:00:16,- Hello and welcome to another episode
00:00:16,00:00:20,"of No Such Thing as a Fish, a weekly podcast coming to you"
00:00:20,00:00:22,from the QI offices in Covent Garden.
00:00:22,00:00:23,My name is Dan Schreiber.
00:00:23,00:00:27,"I am sitting here with Anna Tyshinski, Andrew Hunter Murray"
00:00:27,00:00:28,and James Harkin.
00:00:28,00:00:31,"And once again, we have gathered around the microphones"
00:00:31,00:00:34,with our four favorite facts from the last seven days
00:00:34,00:00:37,"and in no particular order, here we go."
00:00:37,00:00:41,"Starting with fact number one, and that is Andy."
00:00:41,00:00:44,- My fact is that if you took all the hedges in Britain
00:00:44,00:00:45,"and laid them end to end,"
00:00:45,00:00:49,they would stretch to the moon and most of the way back.
00:00:49,00:00:51,(laughing)
00:00:51,00:00:52,- Not like that.
00:00:52,00:00:53,- Grappy ending to that.
00:00:53,00:00:54,(laughing)
00:00:54,00:00:56,How far back?
00:00:56,00:00:58,"- Basically, figures vary about the exact length,"
00:00:58,00:01:00,but it would definitely get you all the way there
00:01:00,00:01:03,and it would definitely not get you all the way back.
00:01:03,00:01:06,- All the alien sheep that you're kind of herding
00:01:06,00:01:08,"into this gap between the earth and the moon,"
00:01:08,00:01:11,they'd be able to escape from that last little gap.
00:01:11,00:01:11,- I don't think they would
00:01:11,00:01:14,because there's one layer of hedging solidly between the two.
00:01:14,00:01:17,"- Yeah, but the thing is with fences,"
00:01:17,00:01:19,you need them on both sides of a field.
00:01:19,00:01:21,"- Yes, what I stupidly imagined is a sort of double row"
00:01:21,00:01:23,"of hedging that runs out halfway back,"
00:01:23,00:01:25,"but you don't actually, you don't need that."
00:01:25,00:01:28,"- Basically, the UK has about 700,000 kilometers of hedges."
00:01:28,00:01:31,"Some people say there are only about 500,000 kilometers"
00:01:31,00:01:33,"of hedges, so the figures do vary,"
00:01:33,00:01:37,but it definitely is between one and two times the distance
00:01:37,00:01:39,"between the earth and the moon, right?"
00:01:39,00:01:43,"That's quite a big discrepancy, 200,000 kilometers."
00:01:43,00:01:45,"- Yeah, I mean, it's quite hard to survey."
00:01:45,00:01:47,"There are quite good ways of measuring now,"
00:01:47,00:01:49,as in you can use satellites to measure the distances.
00:01:49,00:01:50,"- Who has the time, though,"
00:01:50,00:01:54,to go through all the hedges from satellite imagery?
00:01:54,00:01:56,- It feels like you have the answer to that question.
00:01:56,00:01:57,I know you're just teaming me up.
00:01:57,00:01:58,(all laughing)
00:01:58,00:02:01,"- And with that, James, quit the podcast"
00:02:01,00:02:03,to start his hedge measuring career.
00:02:03,00:02:05,- I was just thinking that I think
00:02:05,00:02:06,"if you have satellite imagery,"
00:02:06,00:02:08,there's more important things to do than work out
00:02:08,00:02:11,"whether it's 200,000 or 300,000 or whatever it was."
00:02:11,00:02:12,"- It's true, it's true."
00:02:12,00:02:13,"- I'm saying this, by the way,"
00:02:13,00:02:15,as someone who has been active
00:02:15,00:02:17,in the hedge community in the past.
00:02:17,00:02:18,- What do you mean?
00:02:18,00:02:20,"- When I lived in the countryside in the Lake District,"
00:02:20,00:02:23,"when I moved in, one of the first people to come around"
00:02:23,00:02:25,"was a couple saying, would you be interested"
00:02:25,00:02:27,in getting involved with the hedges?
00:02:27,00:02:28,- Right.
00:02:28,00:02:29,"- And it does sound like a swinging case,"
00:02:29,00:02:30,but it certainly was.
00:02:30,00:02:32,(all laughing)
00:02:32,00:02:34,"- Basically, in Silverdale, where I lived,"
00:02:34,00:02:36,"so it's just outside the Lake District,"
00:02:36,00:02:38,the hedges were very important
00:02:38,00:02:39,"'cause they have a lot of wildlife,"
00:02:39,00:02:42,and we wanted to save them.
00:02:42,00:02:44,I only went to one or two meetings.
00:02:44,00:02:46,- So what happened at those meetings?
00:02:46,00:02:47,"- Part of it, you might go around"
00:02:47,00:02:49,"picking stuff out of the hedges,"
00:02:49,00:02:51,like cleaning the hedges and stuff.
00:02:51,00:02:53,"But mostly, you're just trying to stop people"
00:02:53,00:02:54,from cutting the hedges down.
00:02:54,00:02:57,"- Or just vigilante wandering the countryside,"
00:02:57,00:02:59,throwing yourselves at farmers.
00:02:59,00:03:00,"- That was probably in the third meeting,"
00:03:00,00:03:02,but all that stuff happened.
00:03:02,00:03:04,"Like the Extinction Rebellion side of it,"
00:03:04,00:03:05,I think that came later.
00:03:05,00:03:07,It was mostly just chatting about hedges.
00:03:07,00:03:10,"- Was it, James, the National Hedge Laying Society?"
00:03:10,00:03:12,"- I don't recall very well, but I don't think so."
00:03:12,00:03:14,"It was a long time ago, this."
00:03:14,00:03:15,- There are a few different hedge bodies.
00:03:15,00:03:16,- Yeah.
00:03:16,00:03:20,- But isn't this the one grand daddy body of hedging?
00:03:20,00:03:22,"- I mean, the National Hedge Laying Society are huge."
00:03:22,00:03:24,"- You wanted to talk about hedge laying, then, Andy,"
00:03:24,00:03:25,"which is different, of course,"
00:03:25,00:03:27,to James's hedge rubbish clearance.
00:03:27,00:03:29,- The National Hedge Laying Society
00:03:29,00:03:30,and the National Hedge Maintenance Society
00:03:30,00:03:33,are the jets and the sharks of the hedge world.
00:03:33,00:03:35,"Vicious, vicious knife fights"
00:03:35,00:03:36,between them whenever they meet.
00:03:36,00:03:38,Life on the hedge.
00:03:38,00:03:38,- God.
00:03:38,00:03:40,- But it is really cool hedge laying.
00:03:40,00:03:42,I didn't know about it.
00:03:42,00:03:44,I didn't know what it was.
00:03:44,00:03:48,"And it is literally making a hedge lie down, isn't it?"
00:03:48,00:03:50,"It's flaccidating a hedge, essentially."
00:03:50,00:03:52,- So the hedge pre-exists.
00:03:52,00:03:55,"- A hedge has to pre-exist to lay a hedge, yes."
00:03:55,00:03:57,"Otherwise, you're just building a hedge, I guess."
00:03:57,00:03:59,- So that's what I got confused about.
00:03:59,00:04:00,"I thought you have to plant a hedge, don't you?"
00:04:00,00:04:01,"- Yeah, that's what I thought."
00:04:01,00:04:02,"- Well, you're planting a hedge"
00:04:02,00:04:03,into an already existing hedge.
00:04:03,00:04:06,"So, basically, this is a way of maintaining the hedges,"
00:04:06,00:04:08,"which is very important that we do,"
00:04:08,00:04:10,'cause they're so bi-diverse and stuff.
00:04:10,00:04:13,"And so you've got to stop them growing too high, too tall,"
00:04:13,00:04:15,because if the trees that make up a hedge
00:04:15,00:04:18,"turn into mature trees, then they eventually die."
00:04:18,00:04:19,"And also, they're trunks shoot up"
00:04:19,00:04:21,and they don't have any foliage at the bottom
00:04:21,00:04:22,and there are big gaps in the hedge
00:04:22,00:04:23,and all the sheep get through.
00:04:23,00:04:26,"And so what hedge laying is, it's really clever,"
00:04:26,00:04:29,"you turn the hedge from vertical to horizontal, essentially."
00:04:29,00:04:33,So you do this by kind of cutting the upright trunks
00:04:33,00:04:37,"at the base, so you make a little slit in the upright trunk."
00:04:37,00:04:39,"But you don't cut it all the way down to the bottom,"
00:04:39,00:04:41,'cause you really don't wanna kill the trunk.
00:04:41,00:04:43,You gotta keep the sap flowing up it.
00:04:43,00:04:45,"And when you split it, you can bend it over,"
00:04:45,00:04:49,"as you can imagine, like a hinge so that it lies down."
00:04:49,00:04:50,"And then when you do that,"
00:04:50,00:04:54,then it will start growing new hedgery upwards.
00:04:54,00:04:55,So you've got to keep on bending it over
00:04:55,00:04:58,so a new youthful bit shoots up.
00:04:58,00:04:59,"- That's very clever, that's great, I didn't know that."
00:04:59,00:05:00,"- And it's called ""pleaching."""
00:05:00,00:05:01,"- ""Pleaching."""
00:05:01,00:05:03,"- The ""pleach"" and the ""ligger"" is the bit"
00:05:03,00:05:05,"on the hedge that's horizontal, if you ever wanna."
00:05:05,00:05:06,"- Wow, that's good new words."
00:05:06,00:05:07,"- ""Pleaching"" and ""liggering."""
00:05:07,00:05:08,"- ""Pleaching."""
00:05:08,00:05:10,Most hedges I've seen in the photos
00:05:10,00:05:11,"while researching this,"
00:05:11,00:05:12,they sort of look like they've been blown
00:05:12,00:05:15,to a 45 degree angle by the wind.
00:05:15,00:05:17,"- It's very controversial, the angle at which you should"
00:05:17,00:05:20,"put it, and there are 35 different types of hedge laying,"
00:05:20,00:05:23,"and people say 30 degrees, 45 occasionally."
00:05:23,00:05:24,I don't know where you saw this hedge.
00:05:24,00:05:27,"- It was on actually the official bodies website, so."
00:05:27,00:05:30,"- Right, so they've made a statement with that angle."
00:05:30,00:05:31,"- It's a good website, isn't it?"
00:05:31,00:05:32,The National Hedge Laying Bodies website.
00:05:32,00:05:37,"- I think that's being very kind, it's nice, it's pleasant."
00:05:37,00:05:39,- Wow.
00:05:39,00:05:42,- What do you think were its main drawbacks?
00:05:42,00:05:43,"- To be honest, I looked at it and thought I might"
00:05:43,00:05:45,get in touch and just give some suggestions.
00:05:45,00:05:48,I thought there was a lot of information missing.
00:05:48,00:05:52,"There was a lot of, yeah, there was a lot more they could do"
00:05:52,00:05:55,with their annual award for best hedge.
00:05:55,00:05:56,- What could they do?
00:05:56,00:05:59,"- More photos, more understanding of what had happened."
00:05:59,00:06:01,"If you're a novice, like me coming to it."
00:06:01,00:06:03,"- Like match reports, 'cause they do have"
00:06:03,00:06:05,"an annual championship, you're right, yeah, yeah."
00:06:05,00:06:06,"- Yeah, the National Hedge Laying Championship."
00:06:06,00:06:08,"- I did want a bit more pros, actually,"
00:06:08,00:06:11,of what had happened in each year's championships.
00:06:11,00:06:12,They just give us the kind of winners
00:06:12,00:06:13,and the runners up.
00:06:13,00:06:14,"- Can I, sorry, can I just ask a question?"
00:06:14,00:06:17,Is it for the person who's best at bending the hedges
00:06:17,00:06:19,or is it for the actual best hedge?
00:06:19,00:06:19,- Great question.
00:06:19,00:06:21,I would have loved to have got the answer
00:06:21,00:06:22,as I read the website.
00:06:22,00:06:24,- I did get the answer from the website
00:06:24,00:06:26,because it's the former.
00:06:26,00:06:29,"It's not the best, it's the person who's laying the hedge."
00:06:29,00:06:30,- Yeah.
00:06:30,00:06:31,"- You have to scroll down, so there's a bar"
00:06:31,00:06:32,at the side of the website often
00:06:32,00:06:35,and you get the down arrow at the bottom.
00:06:35,00:06:35,- Is that what it is?
00:06:35,00:06:37,"- You get more, it's like turning a page"
00:06:37,00:06:39,"but on your laptop, it's amazing."
00:06:39,00:06:42,"- 'Cause I presume like hedges are hundreds,"
00:06:42,00:06:43,"if not thousands of years old, right?"
00:06:43,00:06:46,And they don't change that much from year to year.
00:06:46,00:06:49,So whatever's the best hedge in 2019 is likely
00:06:49,00:06:52,to be the best hedge in 2020 and 2021.
00:06:52,00:06:54,Do you know how to tell how old a hedge is?
00:06:54,00:06:55,No.
00:06:55,00:06:56,- Ask it nicely.
00:06:56,00:06:56,- There's a thing called Hooper's Rule.
00:06:56,00:06:59,"No, it's very rude to ask a hedge its age."
00:06:59,00:07:00,"- Oh, right, good to know."
00:07:00,00:07:01,- There's a thing called Hooper's Rule.
00:07:01,00:07:04,"It's named after a guy called M.D. Hooper,"
00:07:04,00:07:05,who is one of the people who invented it.
00:07:05,00:07:09,"And you take a 30-yard stretch of hedge,"
00:07:09,00:07:12,"you count the number of species in it,"
00:07:12,00:07:17,you multiply that number by 110 and then you add 30 years.
00:07:17,00:07:20,And that will tell you exactly how old a hedge is
00:07:20,00:07:22,and it's called Hooper's Rule.
00:07:22,00:07:26,"And it was published in the '70s and almost immediately,"
00:07:26,00:07:28,someone else did a publication saying it's complete bollocks.
00:07:28,00:07:30,(laughing)
00:07:30,00:07:32,"At very best, it can give you an approximation"
00:07:32,00:07:36,and you should always use village or council
00:07:36,00:07:38,or parish history.
00:07:38,00:07:40,"- Also, that's gonna be a hell of a lot quicker"
00:07:40,00:07:41,than counting meticulously.
00:07:41,00:07:43,All the species in a hedge.
00:07:43,00:07:45,"- There's a guy, and this was in the article"
00:07:45,00:07:47,"that you sent Andy, where you found your fact from,"
00:07:47,00:07:50,"where he spent two years, he's a British ecologist,"
00:07:50,00:07:51,spent two years looking at all of the species
00:07:51,00:07:54,inside one particular bit of hedgerow.
00:07:54,00:07:57,"And he counted 2,070 in total over those years."
00:07:57,00:07:58,And this is not the wood.
00:07:58,00:08:02,This is like little ants and animals and so on.
00:08:02,00:08:04,- And he's amazing.
00:08:04,00:08:07,"Robert Walton, he was challenged during a car journey"
00:08:07,00:08:09,"by another friend of his, another naturalist."
00:08:09,00:08:11,"Not sure what the exact terms of the challenge were,"
00:08:11,00:08:13,but it's basically why didn't you study that hedge
00:08:13,00:08:14,for a very long time?
00:08:14,00:08:15,(laughing)
00:08:15,00:08:16,"And he spent a year on it and he's like,"
00:08:16,00:08:18,"""God, I'm still getting loads every single week."""
00:08:18,00:08:21,"So he spent another, spent a second year on it."
00:08:21,00:08:22,It was incredible.
00:08:22,00:08:23,"He reckoned there were more than 3,000,"
00:08:23,00:08:24,"but he could only count 2,000"
00:08:24,00:08:25,'cause they were with the naked eye
00:08:25,00:08:27,that he was looking at them.
00:08:27,00:08:29,"2,000 species is the most detailed study"
00:08:29,00:08:30,of a hedge ever made.
00:08:30,00:08:32,Ever.
00:08:32,00:08:33,I can't believe no one else has done this.
00:08:33,00:08:35,"- Yeah, I know, it's weird, isn't it?"
00:08:35,00:08:35,"Well, that's what he was saying."
00:08:35,00:08:36,It's bizarre how important they are
00:08:36,00:08:39,"that we know so little about what's in them, in a way."
00:08:39,00:08:41,"And also, they've been quite denigrated hedges."
00:08:41,00:08:43,They've had a bad rep for ages.
00:08:43,00:08:45,"Definitely, when I was growing up,"
00:08:45,00:08:49,"I thought that the hedge was often quite new, right?"
00:08:49,00:08:51,'Cause you learned about enclosure.
00:08:51,00:08:52,This is the big deal.
00:08:52,00:08:53,"God, it's drilled into you at school."
00:08:53,00:08:55,"Enclosure, agricultural revolution."
00:08:55,00:08:57,You build hedges all around the fields
00:08:57,00:08:58,and there's this common misconception
00:08:58,00:09:00,and it's still on loads of sites today
00:09:00,00:09:02,that the hedges just came up in enclosure
00:09:02,00:09:04,when the landowners locked off their fields.
00:09:04,00:09:06,- I don't think every listener's gonna know about enclosure.
00:09:06,00:09:07,I think we should say a bit.
00:09:07,00:09:09,"- No, that's, if you don't remember,"
00:09:09,00:09:12,if you're not English and don't remember your year A history.
00:09:12,00:09:13,- So what is it?
00:09:13,00:09:14,I don't know this.
00:09:14,00:09:15,"- In the agricultural revolution,"
00:09:15,00:09:20,landowners decided to end the common land usage policies
00:09:20,00:09:21,that have been existing so far
00:09:21,00:09:22,where everyone could graze their animals and plant
00:09:22,00:09:24,when they wanted to do common land
00:09:24,00:09:27,and they enclose their land with fences and hedges.
00:09:27,00:09:29,"And that's where a lot of people think,"
00:09:29,00:09:31,"this grand misconception arises,"
00:09:31,00:09:33,that hedges were all planted.
00:09:33,00:09:34,So loads of hedges in the south of England
00:09:34,00:09:36,do come from the 17th and 18th century.
00:09:36,00:09:40,- You basically cut down the entire of year eight history
00:09:40,00:09:42,into about two sentences.
00:09:42,00:09:43,- There we go.
00:09:43,00:09:44,And now I've told you it's wrong.
00:09:44,00:09:45,(laughing)
00:09:45,00:09:46,They're all really old.
00:09:46,00:09:47,- Wow.
00:09:47,00:09:48,"Welcome to year nine, bitches."
00:09:48,00:09:50,(laughing)
00:09:50,00:09:51,Everything is a lie.
00:09:51,00:09:53,- Forget what you heard.
00:09:53,00:09:54,"- Like me in year eight,"
00:09:54,00:09:55,I still stopped listening half way through.
00:09:55,00:09:57,What was I saying?
00:09:57,00:09:59,- Guarantee you can't find enclosure
00:09:59,00:10:00,10 seconds after hearing about it.
00:10:00,00:10:02,And so people thought we could cut them down
00:10:02,00:10:03,"'cause they're new,"
00:10:03,00:10:05,so they weren't part of the intrinsic landscape
00:10:05,00:10:06,"that's full of these amazing,"
00:10:06,00:10:07,ecosystem.
00:10:07,00:10:09,"- A lot of them are like between parishes,"
00:10:09,00:10:10,"for instance,"
00:10:10,00:10:12,which goes back thousands of years.
00:10:12,00:10:14,"And even before that,"
00:10:14,00:10:16,"just people when we first got the sheep's over,"
00:10:16,00:10:19,just trying to keep your sheep in one place kind of thing.
00:10:19,00:10:22,- They kind of function as motorways for species.
00:10:22,00:10:24,Mice get around the countryside on them.
00:10:24,00:10:25,The animals use them for navigation.
00:10:25,00:10:27,"The birds nesting,"
00:10:27,00:10:29,it's really vital that they exist.
00:10:29,00:10:32,And the UK destroyed about half of its hedging
00:10:32,00:10:33,in the 20th century.
00:10:33,00:10:35,So you would have been able to get to the moon
00:10:35,00:10:36,and back again.
00:10:36,00:10:38,"And then maybe to the moon again,"
00:10:38,00:10:40,in the good old days in the 1930s.
00:10:40,00:10:42,"And the reason the UK destroyed half of its hedging,"
00:10:42,00:10:44,give or take is because of Hitler.
00:10:44,00:10:46,"- Oh, he always gets the blame, doesn't he?"
00:10:46,00:10:47,- Get into that give or take.
00:10:47,00:10:49,- More I hear about that man.
00:10:49,00:10:51,- So the UK wanted to be quite food sufficient
00:10:51,00:10:52,"after the Second World War,"
00:10:52,00:10:55,because there had been a few problems
00:10:55,00:10:57,with food supplies during the war.
00:10:57,00:10:59,And so various governments incentivized farmers
00:10:59,00:11:01,"to make their fields much bigger,"
00:11:01,00:11:03,"remove the hedges, join them all up,"
00:11:03,00:11:06,just so you could grow larger amounts of crops.
00:11:06,00:11:07,And they were actually incentivized.
00:11:07,00:11:10,Farmers were paid to get rid of their hedges.
00:11:10,00:11:12,"And only in the last 20 years,"
00:11:12,00:11:13,I think has it been truly appreciated
00:11:13,00:11:17,just what a lot of damage this did to biodiversity
00:11:17,00:11:18,and all sorts of things.
00:11:18,00:11:21,"And so now there are aims to build many more hedges,"
00:11:21,00:11:23,"not only to fight climate change,"
00:11:23,00:11:25,but to build biodiversity.
00:11:25,00:11:26,- And against the Nazis.
00:11:26,00:11:29,"- And to just keep the Nazis down,"
00:11:29,00:11:31,just to stop and coming back.
00:11:31,00:11:32,"- Do you want some other hedge words, by the way?"
00:11:32,00:11:33,- Oh yeah.
00:11:33,00:11:35,"- See, that is giving us some great hedge words."
00:11:35,00:11:37,These are actually words in the OED
00:11:37,00:11:39,that have the word hedge in them.
00:11:39,00:11:43,"So to hedge hop, you know what hedge hopping is?"
00:11:43,00:11:46,"- Is that to, there's a field of hedgehogs"
00:11:46,00:11:47,and you're not allowed to touch the ground.
00:11:47,00:11:49,It's like the floor is lava.
00:11:49,00:11:50,- It's a game.
00:11:50,00:11:51,"- Yeah, you have to get to the other side."
00:11:51,00:11:53,- Trampling a hedgehog with every bound.
00:11:53,00:11:55,"- I'm not saying it's a nice game, I'm just saying."
00:11:55,00:11:57,"- Again, once you've torn the hedges down,"
00:11:57,00:11:59,why don't you do this hedgehog trampling game?
00:11:59,00:12:01,"- It's not that, thankfully."
00:12:01,00:12:03,It's a colloquial term for flying your aircraft
00:12:03,00:12:04,"at a very low level,"
00:12:04,00:12:06,so as if you're hopping over hedges.
00:12:06,00:12:08,"- Oh, nice, lovely, got it."
00:12:08,00:12:10,- Hedge wine is very poor quality wine.
00:12:10,00:12:14,"And in fact, hedge is used to mean poor quality."
00:12:14,00:12:17,"And also hedge wench, do you know what a hedge wench is?"
00:12:17,00:12:20,"- Well, a wench is a lusty woman."
00:12:20,00:12:22,- And hedge is poor quality.
00:12:22,00:12:23,So it's a poor quality lusty woman.
00:12:23,00:12:24,(laughing)
00:12:24,00:12:26,- This is a bit more literal.
00:12:26,00:12:29,It's a sex worker who plays their trade in a hedge.
00:12:29,00:12:30,"- Oh, golly."
00:12:30,00:12:32,"- That's a painful, are people paying extra for that?"
00:12:32,00:12:34,Or are you going to get a prickle?
00:12:34,00:12:35,- In a hedge.
00:12:35,00:12:36,"- In a hedge, yeah."
00:12:36,00:12:38,"- We could go back to my place actually,"
00:12:38,00:12:39,just think about it now.
00:12:39,00:12:40,(laughing)
00:12:40,00:12:44,I do think the hedge is going to detract from the experience.
00:12:44,00:12:47,"There are 2,000 species and they're all watching at the moment"
00:12:47,00:12:47,and I don't like it.
00:12:47,00:12:49,"Oh, God."
00:12:49,00:12:51,- A lot of ants up the bum.
00:12:51,00:12:53,Do you know what this proverb means?
00:12:53,00:12:56,It's good sheltering under an old hedge.
00:12:56,00:12:57,It's a very old American proverb.
00:12:57,00:12:59,- Does it mean literally exactly what it sounds like?
00:12:59,00:13:01,(laughing)
00:13:01,00:13:02,"If you find an old hedge,"
00:13:02,00:13:04,you're probably going to be sheltered quite nicely.
00:13:04,00:13:06,- It sounds like it does.
00:13:06,00:13:07,It's actually more cryptic than that.
00:13:07,00:13:10,It means it's good to marry an older woman.
00:13:10,00:13:12,She's the old hedge.
00:13:12,00:13:14,Cause I guess she's more experienced.
00:13:14,00:13:15,- Thicker.
00:13:15,00:13:18,(laughing)
00:13:18,00:13:19,- She's been laid by many men before.
00:13:19,00:13:21,(laughing)
00:13:21,00:13:24,(upbeat music)
00:13:24,00:13:28,"- Okay, it is time for fact number two"
00:13:28,00:13:30,and that is Anna.
00:13:30,00:13:32,"- My fact this week is that in the 1940s,"
00:13:32,00:13:35,prisoners of war in the US helped build a model
00:13:35,00:13:37,of the Mississippi basin
00:13:37,00:13:40,that was about twice the size of the Vatican.
00:13:40,00:13:41,- Wow.
00:13:41,00:13:43,"- God, it's actually so many elements in that fact"
00:13:43,00:13:45,that I'd be impressed if you got to the end of it.
00:13:45,00:13:46,But.
00:13:46,00:13:49,- So I don't know what a model of the Mississippi basin was
00:13:49,00:13:50,before hearing about this fact.
00:13:50,00:13:52,"- Okay, does that mean you,"
00:13:52,00:13:53,cause you know what a model is presumably.
00:13:53,00:13:54,- I certainly do.
00:13:54,00:13:56,- And you know what the Mississippi is.
00:13:56,00:14:00,But I'm conceptually incapable of joining those two together.
00:14:00,00:14:00,(laughing)
00:14:00,00:14:02,Is what we've learned.
00:14:02,00:14:03,(laughing)
00:14:03,00:14:05,"- Well, for those of you who are, you know,"
00:14:05,00:14:08,"imaginationally absent at home,"
00:14:08,00:14:11,it's a model of a river and it's surrounding land.
00:14:11,00:14:13,- But a river's made of water.
00:14:13,00:14:14,- Yeah.
00:14:14,00:14:15,- Yeah.
00:14:15,00:14:18,"- So for water in the model, they use water."
00:14:18,00:14:20,- They also have to model the banks
00:14:20,00:14:22,otherwise that's just a puddle on the floor.
00:14:22,00:14:23,"- Yeah, exactly."
00:14:23,00:14:25,"Yeah, yeah, I see, okay."
00:14:25,00:14:28,"- So you've modeled everything surrounding the river,"
00:14:28,00:14:30,"basically, and then just pour water into it."
00:14:30,00:14:32,"- All like the flood plains and stuff like that, right?"
00:14:32,00:14:33,"- Yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:14:33,00:14:35,- All the land around it that might be affected by it.
00:14:35,00:14:37,"- Exactly, yeah, yeah."
00:14:37,00:14:38,"- Why did we want to muddle it, I guess?"
00:14:38,00:14:40,"- Well, we wanted to figure out how it worked"
00:14:40,00:14:41,and get to know it better.
00:14:41,00:14:43,So this was called the Mississippi River Basin
00:14:43,00:14:47,"Model Waterways Experiment Station near Clinton, Mississippi."
00:14:47,00:14:50,And it was built because the Mississippi was always flooding
00:14:50,00:14:53,and actually they just had a couple of really awful floods.
00:14:53,00:14:56,"So in 1927, there was the worst flood in US history."
00:14:56,00:14:58,"1937, another bad one."
00:14:58,00:15:01,"And this guy called Eugene Raybold said,"
00:15:01,00:15:04,"the problem we're having is that whenever there's a flood,"
00:15:04,00:15:05,"we try and fix it,"
00:15:05,00:15:07,"and this is a problem with flooding today still,"
00:15:07,00:15:09,but we try and fix it in the individual place
00:15:09,00:15:12,"where there was a flood, so we'll build a levee or a dam."
00:15:12,00:15:15,But that's not understanding the river as a whole.
00:15:15,00:15:17,And that just has a knock on effect further down.
00:15:17,00:15:18,You're just kicking it further down the road.
00:15:18,00:15:21,So what we need to do is we need to build the whole river.
00:15:21,00:15:24,And he was quite sure on laborers
00:15:24,00:15:25,"'cause everyone was fighting in the war,"
00:15:25,00:15:26,"for what there were,"
00:15:26,00:15:29,were quite a lot of German and Italian prisoners of war.
00:15:29,00:15:31,And so they all must have been so confused
00:15:31,00:15:34,when they were carted to prisoner of war camp in Mississippi
00:15:34,00:15:37,and told to build the Mississippi River again.
00:15:37,00:15:39,"- For those men getting home after the war,"
00:15:39,00:15:41,"after the, oh, Hans, we're so worried."
00:15:41,00:15:43,"You know, you were kept as a prisoner of war."
00:15:43,00:15:44,It must have been awful.
00:15:44,00:15:46,What did they make you do?
00:15:46,00:15:47,"Oh, you know, just really,"
00:15:47,00:15:48,it was really difficult actually.
00:15:48,00:15:50,"Yeah, but what were you doing, Hans?"
00:15:50,00:15:52,Were you maybe picking cotton in the fields
00:15:52,00:15:53,or working in a mine?
00:15:53,00:15:56,"Yeah, I mean, you know, we don't model, model building."
00:15:56,00:15:59,"- Like that's, it's twice the size of the Vatican."
00:15:59,00:16:01,"I reckon there was a lot of earth being moved around, right?"
00:16:01,00:16:02,"- Yeah, it's not model building,"
00:16:02,00:16:04,like a wallhammer fanatic.
00:16:04,00:16:05,(all laughing)
00:16:05,00:16:08,"- It wasn't a ground build, they didn't come to play with it."
00:16:08,00:16:09,"Basically, that's what they were doing."
00:16:09,00:16:12,- It feels to me like I wouldn't personally
00:16:12,00:16:14,"want to be part of that team, you know?"
00:16:14,00:16:16,- Given the choice between that
00:16:16,00:16:18,"and other prisoner of war labor,"
00:16:18,00:16:20,like absolutely will be on model road.
00:16:20,00:16:21,- Team fake river.
00:16:21,00:16:22,"- Model railway, I've given away my address there."
00:16:22,00:16:25,(all laughing)
00:16:25,00:16:26,"- River modeling duty, yeah."
00:16:26,00:16:27,"- How big was it, Anna?"
00:16:27,00:16:27,"Sorry, I missed that."
00:16:27,00:16:28,"- So, I haven't actually said it."
00:16:28,00:16:30,I've just said it was about twice the size of the Vatican.
00:16:30,00:16:33,- But you know how big the Vatican is.
00:16:33,00:16:34,- And you know what twice is.
00:16:34,00:16:36,Can you not put those two concepts together?
00:16:36,00:16:38,"- I can't actually think of how big the Vatican,"
00:16:38,00:16:41,"because the Vatican is a whole city, right?"
00:16:41,00:16:42,Like it's big.
00:16:42,00:16:43,"- It's difficult, it's difficult."
00:16:43,00:16:45,"- But it's not a big city, you know that."
00:16:45,00:16:47,"- Yeah, but okay, that still doesn't help."
00:16:47,00:16:49,"- I reckon it's about a square kilometer, is it?"
00:16:49,00:16:51,"- It's, well, I can give you another measure."
00:16:51,00:16:54,It was also about the size of 120 football pitches.
00:16:54,00:16:56,It was 210 acres.
00:16:56,00:16:58,- Can we get it in hedges next time?
00:16:58,00:17:01,"- Sorry, distance to the moon, it's, God knows."
00:17:01,00:17:03,"- It's so huge, this thing."
00:17:03,00:17:06,The streams in this thing are eight miles long in total.
00:17:06,00:17:08,Like it's really big.
00:17:08,00:17:09,"- Yeah, and the only way you could see it all"
00:17:09,00:17:12,"was from an observation point that was four stories tall,"
00:17:12,00:17:13,wasn't it?
00:17:13,00:17:15,"So you had to climb right the way up,"
00:17:15,00:17:17,and then you could see the whole thing.
00:17:17,00:17:17,- Yeah.
00:17:17,00:17:20,- One gallon of water in the thing
00:17:20,00:17:24,represented 1.5 million gallons of water in the real world.
00:17:24,00:17:26,- Very cool. - So cool.
00:17:26,00:17:29,- I think five minutes of water running through the basin
00:17:29,00:17:33,simulated an entire day of water running through the Mississippi.
00:17:33,00:17:34,So you could quite quickly work out.
00:17:34,00:17:35,And it was super useful.
00:17:35,00:17:37,It was a few years after it was built.
00:17:37,00:17:38,There were some signs of flooding.
00:17:38,00:17:40,People were getting a bit nervous.
00:17:40,00:17:41,"Signs of flooding in the Missouri River,"
00:17:41,00:17:44,"which is a tributary of the Mississippi,"
00:17:44,00:17:45,longest river in the US.
00:17:45,00:17:49,And so they simulated what was happening in the little model.
00:17:49,00:17:50,"And they said, oh, shit, yeah, it's"
00:17:50,00:17:52,"going to flood here and there, not too much there."
00:17:52,00:17:53,Build it down there.
00:17:53,00:17:55,And they did and saved a few million quid.
00:17:55,00:17:57,- That's amazing.
00:17:57,00:18:00,"I was thinking about the songs, because it's really tied"
00:18:00,00:18:01,into blues.
00:18:01,00:18:04,And it's also a river that comes up a lot in songs.
00:18:04,00:18:05,"And for me, I love Jeff Buckley."
00:18:05,00:18:06,- Like Old Man River.
00:18:06,00:18:09,"- Like Old Man River, Jeff Buckley drowned in the Mississippi."
00:18:09,00:18:09,- Did he?
00:18:09,00:18:11,"- Yeah, and that, so for me, it's a river"
00:18:11,00:18:13,that I've always noticed in songs.
00:18:13,00:18:16,"So I was looking into it, and I found out that actually,"
00:18:16,00:18:20,"the Mississippi River actually had a sign to it,"
00:18:20,00:18:23,a songwriter and singer called Charlie Maguire.
00:18:23,00:18:25,And he was the singing ranger.
00:18:25,00:18:26,"- What's the job, sorry?"
00:18:26,00:18:27,- He goes around.
00:18:27,00:18:29,"- Yeah, he writes songs about the Mississippi."
00:18:29,00:18:32,- I better use the word hippie quite a lot.
00:18:32,00:18:35,"- Dippy, are you going for a Dippy in the Mississippi?"
00:18:35,00:18:38,"It's going to get pretty nippy, get slippy, love."
00:18:38,00:18:40,"We could do this job, it's pretty easy."
00:18:40,00:18:43,"- Yeah, no, he wrote a lot of songs at his time."
00:18:43,00:18:46,"So, and the songs would embody the story of the Mississippi."
00:18:46,00:18:48,So one song was called Great Mississippi.
00:18:48,00:18:50,That was about where it starts and where it ends.
00:18:50,00:18:51,- The route one.
00:18:51,00:18:52,- Rock strata.
00:18:52,00:18:53,- When was this guy's story?
00:18:53,00:18:54,- 2003.
00:18:54,00:18:54,"- Oh, wow."
00:18:54,00:18:56,"- Yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:18:56,00:18:57,The singing ranger is the only person
00:18:57,00:18:59,that's ever been given this position.
00:18:59,00:19:01,"And yeah, he wrote tons of songs, won lots of awards."
00:19:01,00:19:03,Not Grammys.
00:19:03,00:19:03,- No Grammys.
00:19:03,00:19:05,- Was it awards for best song about the Mississippi
00:19:05,00:19:09,written by the person employed by the songs about the Mississippi?
00:19:09,00:19:10,- I reckon we've got a chance this year
00:19:10,00:19:12,with the old nippy song.
00:19:12,00:19:15,- I had to completely agree.
00:19:15,00:19:16,- Here's a cool thing about the Mississippi.
00:19:16,00:19:19,It's a map that was published of the river.
00:19:19,00:19:22,And it was published in 1866.
00:19:22,00:19:24,And it's called The Ribbon Map of the Father of Waters.
00:19:24,00:19:26,And it's a strip map.
00:19:26,00:19:30,"So the map was 11 feet long, but only three inches wide."
00:19:30,00:19:31,- Oh my gosh.
00:19:31,00:19:32,- I know.
00:19:32,00:19:33,It's really funny.
00:19:33,00:19:35,Strip maps used to be really big.
00:19:35,00:19:36,So that these just weren't really long.
00:19:36,00:19:38,- Really long.
00:19:38,00:19:39,"If you were planning a specific trip,"
00:19:39,00:19:41,"and this is ages and centuries ago,"
00:19:41,00:19:43,you might have a strip map.
00:19:43,00:19:44,"If you were going on a pilgrimage to Jerusalem,"
00:19:44,00:19:47,'cause it's basically one route.
00:19:47,00:19:48,And it says turn left at this town
00:19:48,00:19:50,and then go straight along here for another five miles
00:19:50,00:19:51,and then turn right at whatever.
00:19:51,00:19:54,"And it was on a spool, basically."
00:19:54,00:19:55,So you just spool along as you went.
00:19:55,00:19:58,I think it was more for tourism purposes than for cartography.
00:19:58,00:20:00,- I might be wrong about this.
00:20:00,00:20:02,"I think they used to have like GPS's of those, did they?"
00:20:02,00:20:03,"- Yes, they did."
00:20:03,00:20:04,I met the guy who owns loads of them.
00:20:04,00:20:06,I borrowed some from him.
00:20:06,00:20:08,"And you put a wristwatch on exactly like James says,"
00:20:08,00:20:09,like London to Brighton.
00:20:09,00:20:12,You just load in the cartridge for London to Brighton.
00:20:12,00:20:14,"And then as you're driving along, you just wind on a bit."
00:20:14,00:20:15,- So clever. - So clever.
00:20:15,00:20:16,"- Oh, wow."
00:20:16,00:20:17,- Crawly. - That's so cool.
00:20:17,00:20:18,(laughing)
00:20:18,00:20:19,- Wow.
00:20:19,00:20:20,"- Yeah, really fun."
00:20:20,00:20:22,- What happens if there's a closed road?
00:20:22,00:20:23,- You're stuffed.
00:20:23,00:20:23,"- Yeah, you're stuffed."
00:20:23,00:20:25,- You can only go in that.
00:20:25,00:20:27,It only tells you that you're on the right route.
00:20:27,00:20:28,"- Or you need to have several,"
00:20:28,00:20:30,the whole back of your car is full.
00:20:30,00:20:32,It's tiny. - Car refurbification.
00:20:32,00:20:33,- Exactly.
00:20:33,00:20:34,(laughing)
00:20:34,00:20:36,- James Robert Scott.
00:20:36,00:20:37,You know him?
00:20:37,00:20:37,- No.
00:20:37,00:20:40,"- He was in West Quincee, Missouri"
00:20:40,00:20:44,when there was a great flood of the Mississippi in 1993.
00:20:44,00:20:46,So there was flooding happening all over the place
00:20:46,00:20:48,and they'd put lots of sandbags in
00:20:48,00:20:51,and levees or levees or how he pronounced that.
00:20:51,00:20:55,"Anyway, he decided that he was going to remove"
00:20:55,00:21:00,some of the sandbags and basically allow an area to flood.
00:21:00,00:21:02,"And it was very, no one died, but it's very dangerous."
00:21:02,00:21:04,"And also, you know, lots of people lost land"
00:21:04,00:21:06,and stuff like that.
00:21:06,00:21:09,He claimed that he did it because his town was in trouble
00:21:09,00:21:12,and he wanted to move the sandbags from one place to another
00:21:12,00:21:16,"to try and, you know, keep his town safe."
00:21:16,00:21:18,But then apparently he told his friend
00:21:18,00:21:19,that he'd actually done it
00:21:19,00:21:22,so that he could strand his wife on the other side
00:21:22,00:21:25,of the river so that he could have an affair.
00:21:25,00:21:26,- So he could have an affair?
00:21:26,00:21:27,- Yeah.
00:21:27,00:21:29,- How long was he trying to strand her for?
00:21:29,00:21:32,"- Well, a few weeks, he was hoping that it might happen."
00:21:32,00:21:33,Yeah. - Climacy.
00:21:33,00:21:35,"- He maintains his innocence, I should say."
00:21:35,00:21:37,"He's in prison, I found him guilty."
00:21:37,00:21:39,He's eligible for parole in 2023.
00:21:39,00:21:43,"- And that's for the sandbag moving, not for the affair?"
00:21:43,00:21:46,"- Yes, I don't think it's illegal to have an affair."
00:21:46,00:21:48,- A very puritanical.
00:21:48,00:21:51,"- No, because all the damage that it caused."
00:21:51,00:21:51,"- Yeah, of course."
00:21:51,00:21:53,- It was billions of dollars of damage.
00:21:53,00:21:54,- What?
00:21:54,00:21:56,- One figure I read was 15 billion.
00:21:56,00:21:57,- How many sandbags did he move?
00:21:57,00:21:58,"- Well, you only need--"
00:21:58,00:22:01,- You only need to remove one finger from the dam
00:22:01,00:22:03,"and then everything goes. - Yeah, that's true."
00:22:03,00:22:04,And you've got to be needing those fingers
00:22:04,00:22:07,when you're conducting your illicit extramarital affair.
00:22:07,00:22:09,(laughing)
00:22:09,00:22:11,"- There are easier ways to have affairs, aren't there?"
00:22:11,00:22:12,- It feels like-- - Ken Dark?
00:22:12,00:22:13,- Get a hedge.
00:22:13,00:22:14,- Why not?
00:22:14,00:22:16,(laughing)
00:22:16,00:22:19,(upbeat music)
00:22:19,00:22:25,"- Okay, it is time for fact number three and that is James."
00:22:25,00:22:28,"- Okay, my fact this week is that one of the few historians"
00:22:28,00:22:32,to use the term Dark Ages is Professor Ken Dark.
00:22:32,00:22:33,(laughing)
00:22:33,00:22:34,- It's funny.
00:22:34,00:22:36,- It's funny having a professor called Ken.
00:22:36,00:22:38,(laughing)
00:22:38,00:22:39,- I think that's funny enough.
00:22:39,00:22:40,- Why?
00:22:40,00:22:41,- What?
00:22:41,00:22:42,- My name's Ken Dark.
00:22:42,00:22:43,(laughing)
00:22:43,00:22:47,"- Because Ken in Scots, Old Scots means knowledge,"
00:22:47,00:22:49,"like you're Ken, and so, and he's a professor."
00:22:49,00:22:51,So is that why you found funny about that?
00:22:51,00:22:52,"- God, it does mean knowledge you're right."
00:22:52,00:22:54,And it makes me think that Ken of Barbie and Ken
00:22:54,00:22:59,"has sunk a long way, hasn't he, since the Ken's view."
00:22:59,00:23:00,- Are they called the Dark Ages?
00:23:00,00:23:01,- After Ken.
00:23:01,00:23:02,- After Ken Dark.
00:23:02,00:23:03,- Or they're not.
00:23:03,00:23:04,- Should've called it the Ken Ages.
00:23:04,00:23:05,- This is just--
00:23:05,00:23:06,(laughing)
00:23:06,00:23:07,- Not Ken Ages.
00:23:07,00:23:08,- Ken Ages ago.
00:23:08,00:23:10,(laughing)
00:23:10,00:23:12,- Very good.
00:23:12,00:23:16,"This is just a complete coincidence, really, I think."
00:23:16,00:23:18,So it's an article that I read on the website
00:23:18,00:23:20,"of the University of Sheffield,"
00:23:20,00:23:22,and it's about English heritage.
00:23:22,00:23:26,"So they decided to do a handbook and some websites,"
00:23:26,00:23:28,"stuff like that, where they called the period"
00:23:28,00:23:32,"between 400 AD and 1066, the Dark Ages."
00:23:32,00:23:34,And then there was a huge sort of campaign
00:23:34,00:23:37,"of a lot of Twitter historians saying,"
00:23:37,00:23:39,"and other historians, but saying,"
00:23:39,00:23:41,you can't call it the Dark Ages.
00:23:41,00:23:44,What it does is it makes people think it's a terrible time
00:23:44,00:23:47,where people had an awful life and stuff like that.
00:23:47,00:23:51,"And it was, that's not really what Dark Ages means,"
00:23:51,00:23:53,"but anyway, English heritage said that the reason"
00:23:53,00:23:55,that we're calling it that is because there is
00:23:55,00:23:57,"this professor called Professor Ken Dark,"
00:23:57,00:23:59,and he calls it the Dark Ages.
00:23:59,00:24:01,"He's a proper professor, so we should be able"
00:24:01,00:24:03,to call it that as well.
00:24:03,00:24:06,A lot of people pointed out that the article
00:24:06,00:24:09,that Ken Dark wrote was slightly esoteric.
00:24:09,00:24:11,It was about the Byzantine era.
00:24:11,00:24:13,"It wasn't about the British Dark Ages,"
00:24:13,00:24:15,early modern period.
00:24:15,00:24:16,"If you look at Ken Dark's work,"
00:24:16,00:24:19,"which I have done quite a lot,"
00:24:19,00:24:21,you'll find that he's done something recently
00:24:21,00:24:24,where he talks about illuminating the Dark Ages
00:24:24,00:24:26,and trying to bring light into the Dark Ages.
00:24:26,00:24:29,And he's not calling them the Dark Ages
00:24:29,00:24:30,'cause his name is Ken Dark.
00:24:30,00:24:31,I just wanna make that really true.
00:24:31,00:24:32,- That's what you want do you think?
00:24:32,00:24:34,(laughing)
00:24:34,00:24:36,- There's an argument that they basically just
00:24:36,00:24:38,wanted to kind of shut down the argument
00:24:38,00:24:42,"and say, ""Here's some evidence, this is why we did it."""
00:24:42,00:24:44,"- And yet, if you asked any of those historians,"
00:24:44,00:24:48,would you like to go and live in 430 AD forever?
00:24:48,00:24:51,"You can't come back, it's not a cool history trip."
00:24:51,00:24:53,"- Well, you can take your family."
00:24:53,00:24:55,- You can take your family.
00:24:55,00:24:56,"- Well, for instance, there's one historian"
00:24:56,00:24:57,"called Charles West who said,"
00:24:57,00:25:00,"""If the term Dark Ages really must be used,"
00:25:00,00:25:03,it should at least be reserved for periods
00:25:03,00:25:05,"of true in-humanity and barbarity,"
00:25:05,00:25:07,"such as the 20th century."""
00:25:07,00:25:09,"- Oh, wow. - Oh, wow."
00:25:09,00:25:11,- I do think we've got very snowflakey
00:25:11,00:25:12,about the Dark Ages.
00:25:12,00:25:14,"Come on, it's the one group of people"
00:25:14,00:25:18,that we can still offend and they can never complain.
00:25:18,00:25:20,"All right, it's people in history."
00:25:20,00:25:22,They can't do anything about it.
00:25:22,00:25:23,Just let's call them all ignorant.
00:25:23,00:25:24,"Who cares, they're not coming back."
00:25:24,00:25:27,"- Well, I think the point is that the word dark"
00:25:27,00:25:29,"is not supposed to be ignorant, right?"
00:25:29,00:25:31,It's not supposed to be barbarian.
00:25:31,00:25:33,It's supposed to be a time
00:25:33,00:25:36,where we did not have much information about it.
00:25:36,00:25:37,"And that's what it was originally,"
00:25:37,00:25:40,but people have in the past like popular historians
00:25:40,00:25:43,of kind of in the 70s and 80s have said
00:25:43,00:25:46,that the Dark Ages was a time of darkness and difficulty.
00:25:46,00:25:49,"- But I think they have, it has also been used"
00:25:49,00:25:52,since the concept kind of arose of the Dark Ages
00:25:52,00:25:54,to be denigrating.
00:25:54,00:25:56,And there has always been this idea
00:25:56,00:25:59,that it's also very uncultured time.
00:25:59,00:26:00,- After the Romans.
00:26:00,00:26:03,"- After the Romans, before the Renaissance."
00:26:03,00:26:04,- Before the Normans.
00:26:04,00:26:06,- They were doing bugger all then.
00:26:06,00:26:08,"- It was Francesco Petraca, right?"
00:26:08,00:26:10,"- Petraca, yeah."
00:26:10,00:26:11,"- Yeah, sorry."
00:26:11,00:26:12,"- No, you're just giving him his proper fancy name."
00:26:12,00:26:14,"- His proper fancy name, yeah."
00:26:14,00:26:15,- Petraca.
00:26:15,00:26:16,"- And yeah, basically complaining"
00:26:16,00:26:17,"that there were no good books to read,"
00:26:17,00:26:18,which I find amazing.
00:26:18,00:26:19,"'Cause then it did as you say, it evolved."
00:26:19,00:26:21,"- Petraca was just a guy, right?"
00:26:21,00:26:22,"- Yeah, just a guy."
00:26:22,00:26:23,(laughing)
00:26:23,00:26:24,"- No, he's an Italian scholar."
00:26:24,00:26:27,"I mean, he was big in the 14th century."
00:26:27,00:26:28,- Great poet.
00:26:28,00:26:29,"- Yeah, I haven't read it, but."
00:26:29,00:26:31,- He wrote more than one.
00:26:31,00:26:32,- Get out.
00:26:32,00:26:34,- He was the official poet of the timer.
00:26:34,00:26:36,(laughing)
00:26:36,00:26:39,"- But it does, as you say, sort of mean like,"
00:26:39,00:26:41,it was when science was being brushed away
00:26:41,00:26:43,and religion was coming in.
00:26:43,00:26:43,- Yeah.
00:26:43,00:26:46,"- And as a result, it was a Dark Age for the mind."
00:26:46,00:26:47,- Yeah. - Yeah.
00:26:47,00:26:49,- As well as there being no records.
00:26:49,00:26:50,"That's, it's been, yeah."
00:26:50,00:26:52,- And let's be honest.
00:26:52,00:26:54,- I'm full records of what was going on.
00:26:54,00:26:55,"- Exactly, I know."
00:26:55,00:26:57,- Between 400 and 1056. - I completely agree.
00:26:57,00:26:58,I agree with you.
00:26:58,00:27:00,"- There were other names given to the,"
00:27:00,00:27:01,what are we calling them?
00:27:01,00:27:02,"- Early Middle Ages. - Early Middle Ages, yeah."
00:27:02,00:27:04,- That were published in various books.
00:27:04,00:27:07,"So they included the Barbarous Ages,"
00:27:07,00:27:09,"sounds pretty, you know."
00:27:09,00:27:11,"The Obscure Ages, which I quite like."
00:27:11,00:27:12,(laughing)
00:27:12,00:27:13,Makes me sound quite cool.
00:27:13,00:27:16,"The Monkish Ages, absolutely no argument with that."
00:27:16,00:27:18,"The Muddy Ages, those were all various."
00:27:18,00:27:19,- Really?
00:27:19,00:27:21,"- And then the Mississippi is known as the Old Muddy,"
00:27:21,00:27:22,isn't it?
00:27:22,00:27:23,- Is it? - I think.
00:27:23,00:27:24,- Yeah.
00:27:24,00:27:25,"- This would have been, yeah."
00:27:25,00:27:26,"- Or the Big Muddy, I think maybe."
00:27:26,00:27:27,- The Big Muddy.
00:27:27,00:27:28,- No relation to the Muddy Ages.
00:27:28,00:27:29,(laughing)
00:27:29,00:27:30,- I don't think so.
00:27:30,00:27:34,- Also the Dark Ages could be used to describe the period
00:27:34,00:27:38,"from 1100 BC to 750 BC,"
00:27:38,00:27:40,which was between the collapse of the Bronze Age
00:27:40,00:27:42,civilization in Greece
00:27:42,00:27:44,and the beginning of the Archaic Age in Greece.
00:27:44,00:27:46,"- Oh yeah, the Greek Dark Ages."
00:27:46,00:27:48,- Or it could be from the start of the universe
00:27:48,00:27:51,"until 13.2 billion years ago,"
00:27:51,00:27:52,which was between the start of the universe
00:27:52,00:27:54,and the creation of the first stars.
00:27:54,00:27:56,"That's called the Dark Ages as well, so."
00:27:56,00:27:57,"- Oh, but people get offended, don't they?"
00:27:57,00:28:00,Those little lumps of dust in the air.
00:28:00,00:28:02,"Get offended now, if we call them the Dark Ages."
00:28:02,00:28:04,- I just don't see that the little bits of dust
00:28:04,00:28:06,in the air are gonna be able to come back
00:28:06,00:28:07,and get offended.
00:28:07,00:28:08,I just don't see it.
00:28:08,00:28:11,- You guys are not taking into the account
00:28:11,00:28:14,that time travel will happen one day.
00:28:14,00:28:15,- And that bit for a bit of dust
00:28:15,00:28:16,will jump down my throats.
00:28:16,00:28:17,- Exactly.
00:28:17,00:28:20,"I read in one book, this is a book called ""Europa History"","
00:28:20,00:28:22,that the Middle Ages originally meant the time
00:28:22,00:28:24,between the first coming of Jesus
00:28:24,00:28:26,and the second coming of Jesus.
00:28:26,00:28:28,And since the second coming hasn't as far as we know
00:28:28,00:28:31,"happened, we're still technically in the Middle Ages now."
00:28:31,00:28:32,- That's very exciting.
00:28:32,00:28:33,- That's cool.
00:28:33,00:28:35,"- Yeah, and thank God, 'cause I always get really anxious"
00:28:35,00:28:36,that we're in the modern time
00:28:36,00:28:38,and there's nowhere to go after modern.
00:28:38,00:28:40,So that's good to know that we're actually still in the middle.
00:28:40,00:28:42,"- So if anyone says that I'm middle-aged,"
00:28:42,00:28:44,"I could say yes, well, technically I'm middle-aged"
00:28:44,00:28:46,because the second coming of Christ hasn't happened.
00:28:46,00:28:46,- But so are you.
00:28:46,00:28:47,(laughing)
00:28:47,00:28:48,"- We're all like, yeah."
00:28:48,00:28:50,"- One thing that the Dark Ages,"
00:28:50,00:28:52,"doing the finger quotes there, gave us,"
00:28:52,00:28:54,"which is quite exciting just in reference to literature,"
00:28:54,00:28:58,was spaces in between words.
00:28:58,00:29:01,"So every word, as we know, back in old literature,"
00:29:01,00:29:03,"used to be bunged together, no spaces,"
00:29:03,00:29:05,really hard to tell what's the next word.
00:29:05,00:29:06,And it was in that period.
00:29:06,00:29:09,"The monks started going, let's put a little,"
00:29:09,00:29:11,"we'll put a space in between those two words,"
00:29:11,00:29:11,what do you reckon?
00:29:11,00:29:13,"- So they didn't write books of their own,"
00:29:13,00:29:14,but they did at least introduce some spaces
00:29:14,00:29:16,into the books that already existed.
00:29:16,00:29:18,"- Yeah, it's funny 'cause these days,"
00:29:18,00:29:19,"you know, books have word counts, don't they?"
00:29:19,00:29:21,"You're like, oh, this book is 100,000 words."
00:29:21,00:29:22,"Whereas I guess in those days,"
00:29:22,00:29:24,"we're like, how long is your manuscript?"
00:29:24,00:29:26,"Well, it's one word, like all the other,"
00:29:26,00:29:27,all the other books.
00:29:27,00:29:32,"Yeah, what a word, one very specific word."
00:29:32,00:29:35,"- So word with you, oh, God, here we go."
00:29:35,00:29:39,"- The Greek Dark Ages, I love the Greek Dark Ages."
00:29:39,00:29:40,"- Are they called the Greek Ages,"
00:29:40,00:29:42,is that contentious as well?
00:29:42,00:29:43,"- Oh, probably."
00:29:43,00:29:44,- Who gives us stuff?
00:29:44,00:29:47,"I'm signing up with T-Matter on this one, I've got it."
00:29:47,00:29:49,"- Oh God, I feel like I'm in bad company now."
00:29:49,00:29:52,So they're such a mystery.
00:29:52,00:29:54,"They are, as James was saying,"
00:29:54,00:29:56,this period at the end of the Bronze Age.
00:29:56,00:29:59,"And, but they, what I always loved about them"
00:29:59,00:30:01,is that they happened because of the invasion
00:30:01,00:30:04,"of the sea peoples, do you know about this?"
00:30:04,00:30:08,"And you will love the sea peoples down there, so great."
00:30:08,00:30:10,I actually can't believe that we haven't discussed them before.
00:30:10,00:30:14,- This is the class eight talk that I listened to.
00:30:14,00:30:15,- There we go.
00:30:15,00:30:17,"- Basically, they're a group of people."
00:30:17,00:30:18,"We don't know if they existed,"
00:30:18,00:30:19,"but they're currently historians,"
00:30:19,00:30:23,"best explanation for why in, what was it, 1100 BC."
00:30:23,00:30:24,Civilization just collapsed.
00:30:24,00:30:28,"So we had this amazing, like big palace based states,"
00:30:28,00:30:29,Mycenaeque empire.
00:30:29,00:30:32,"- Minoans, they ever? - Exactly."
00:30:32,00:30:34,And then it all just vanished.
00:30:34,00:30:37,"And also ancient Egypt as well, vanished overnight"
00:30:37,00:30:40,and didn't come back until the Greeks worked out
00:30:40,00:30:42,"to write an alphabet and stuff 400 years later,"
00:30:42,00:30:44,got back on their feet.
00:30:44,00:30:46,And historians think it's 'cause there was someone
00:30:46,00:30:49,"called the sea peoples waltzing around the Mediterranean,"
00:30:49,00:30:51,strange beings who weren't invaded.
00:30:51,00:30:52,- Go on.
00:30:52,00:30:55,"- So, okay, are they, were they of the sea"
00:30:55,00:30:57,or were they just living on boats?
00:30:57,00:30:58,"- Well, it's not."
00:30:58,00:31:00,"- I mean, were they made of water?"
00:31:00,00:31:02,"- Sorry, what is the difference in your mind, Dan,"
00:31:02,00:31:04,between being of the sea and living on a boat?
00:31:04,00:31:08,- Were they like Aquaman or were they a pirate on a boat?
00:31:08,00:31:10,"- The more serious historians, I think,"
00:31:10,00:31:14,"is count the Merman, Merman-made explanation of sea peoples"
00:31:14,00:31:15,and say they're probably just boating.
00:31:15,00:31:17,- What does Ken Dark say about that?
00:31:17,00:31:19,That's what I want to know.
00:31:19,00:31:22,"- They obviously, the Dark Ages,"
00:31:22,00:31:25,"that aren't called the Dark Ages, were whole of Europe."
00:31:25,00:31:28,"And it was partly this whole mini kingdoms thing,"
00:31:28,00:31:31,everyone and his dog can be a king that defined them
00:31:31,00:31:34,because it was all so splintered and it was the Goths
00:31:34,00:31:36,and the Visigoths and the Ostrogoths
00:31:36,00:31:38,"and the Norogoths and the Demigoths and stuff,"
00:31:38,00:31:40,"who were all fighting each other,"
00:31:40,00:31:42,"weren't they, for hundreds of years?"
00:31:42,00:31:44,"And the Vandals and the Allons,"
00:31:44,00:31:45,which I think we've mentioned before.
00:31:45,00:31:47,"The Allons tribe, who I didn't realize,"
00:31:47,00:31:49,brought us Great Danes.
00:31:49,00:31:51,So that's something else the Dark Ages gave us.
00:31:51,00:31:54,"The Allons, who were Iranian, were known for their--"
00:31:54,00:31:56,"- Well, it said the Great Danes aren't Danish."
00:31:56,00:31:58,- I think they must have taken root via Denmark
00:31:58,00:32:00,before they got there.
00:32:00,00:32:01,Before they evolved into what they are today.
00:32:01,00:32:05,They brought the fighting dogs that led to Great Danes.
00:32:05,00:32:08,"But then the person who saw, I would say,"
00:32:08,00:32:11,"who kind of presaged the end of this non-Dark Ages,"
00:32:11,00:32:14,"Dark Ages, was probably Charlemagne, do we think?"
00:32:14,00:32:16,As in he just unified Europe.
00:32:16,00:32:18,"So he did that, it was a big deal."
00:32:18,00:32:21,And you know how he was crowned emperor?
00:32:21,00:32:23,"- How, like, the ceremony or how we can't be--"
00:32:23,00:32:24,"- Yeah, yeah, the ceremony."
00:32:24,00:32:26,"- No, oh, is he one of those strange people"
00:32:26,00:32:27,who crowned themself?
00:32:27,00:32:30,"- No, quite the opposite, apparently."
00:32:30,00:32:32,- It was crowned by someone else.
00:32:32,00:32:34,"- There you go, at the end."
00:32:34,00:32:37,"And in fact, he was crowned again as to his will,"
00:32:37,00:32:38,"according to the court scribe,"
00:32:38,00:32:40,who might have been trying to make him sound really humble.
00:32:40,00:32:41,- So he was running away
00:32:41,00:32:43,while someone was chasing him with a crown.
00:32:43,00:32:44,- Exactly.
00:32:44,00:32:48,"800 AD, Christmas Day, he'd gone to Rome,"
00:32:48,00:32:50,and the Pope decided he's gonna crown him emperor
00:32:50,00:32:53,of this whole bunch of Western Europe.
00:32:53,00:32:55,And he sneaks up behind Charlemagne
00:32:55,00:32:56,while Charlemagne's praying
00:32:56,00:32:58,and pops a crown on his head.
00:32:58,00:32:59,"And apparently Charlemagne just stood up and went,"
00:32:59,00:33:02,"""Oh my gosh, no, what, me?"""
00:33:02,00:33:05,"I couldn't, I couldn't possibly."
00:33:05,00:33:06,"And then he became, you know, the greatest--"
00:33:06,00:33:07,"- It's a good story, isn't it?"
00:33:07,00:33:08,- It's a good story.
00:33:08,00:33:09,"- 'Cause like one of them's praying,"
00:33:09,00:33:12,"so he's holy, and he didn't really want it."
00:33:12,00:33:13,"Well, actually probably happened."
00:33:13,00:33:15,They both got really pissed one night.
00:33:15,00:33:16,- Was it Charlemagne
00:33:16,00:33:19,who supposedly had the asbestos tablecloth?
00:33:19,00:33:20,"- Oh yeah, that is him."
00:33:20,00:33:21,"Yeah, yeah, I think so."
00:33:21,00:33:24,"- That was sort of like his dinner party trick, wasn't it?"
00:33:24,00:33:25,He would--
00:33:25,00:33:27,- He would throw it into a fire
00:33:27,00:33:28,so you wouldn't have to clean it
00:33:28,00:33:30,because asbestos doesn't burn.
00:33:30,00:33:31,"So you put it in the fire,"
00:33:31,00:33:33,"it would kind of sterilize,"
00:33:33,00:33:34,and then you pull it out again
00:33:34,00:33:35,and you could use it again.
00:33:35,00:33:38,"- This was, of course, before they knew about mesothelioma,"
00:33:38,00:33:39,the terrible lung disease
00:33:39,00:33:40,that they presumably all got back then.
00:33:40,00:33:44,- I think you only get that from little shards of asbestos.
00:33:44,00:33:46,"If you have a full tablecloth, you'll be fine."
00:33:46,00:33:46,- You're all right.
00:33:46,00:33:49,"- But if bits come off it, then you would help them."
00:33:49,00:33:51,"I mean, I'm sure no one was living long enough"
00:33:51,00:33:53,to worry about the long-term effects
00:33:53,00:33:54,"of an asbestos table,"
00:33:54,00:33:57,like there were more pressing health concerns than the age.
00:33:57,00:33:59,So they cleared the table.
00:33:59,00:34:00,"- I don't know if, yes,"
00:34:00,00:34:01,I don't know if he did that trick
00:34:01,00:34:02,"where everything stayed underneath,"
00:34:02,00:34:05,but even a kind of swipe.
00:34:05,00:34:06,"- You haven't done that trick, by the way."
00:34:06,00:34:07,"- No, I've tried it once."
00:34:07,00:34:08,- It's hard.
00:34:08,00:34:09,It is harder than you think.
00:34:09,00:34:10,- It does actually work.
00:34:10,00:34:11,- I think I've seen you do it.
00:34:11,00:34:13,"- Yeah, well, I used to be a waiter"
00:34:13,00:34:15,and I used to try it a lot.
00:34:15,00:34:17,And like most of the time you can't really do it.
00:34:17,00:34:19,"And so there's a trick to it, but yeah."
00:34:19,00:34:20,- You were the most fired waiter
00:34:20,00:34:22,"in the North of England, though, I love you."
00:34:22,00:34:23,(laughing)
00:34:23,00:34:26,(upbeat music)
00:34:26,00:34:30,"- Okay, it is time for our final fact of the show."
00:34:30,00:34:31,And that is my fact.
00:34:31,00:34:34,My fact this week is that the metal used
00:34:34,00:34:39,to make Grammy Award trophies is called Grammium.
00:34:39,00:34:40,(laughing)
00:34:40,00:34:40,- Amazing.
00:34:40,00:34:41,- What a coincidence.
00:34:41,00:34:42,(laughing)
00:34:42,00:34:46,"- Well, this is a trademarked metal alloy, a zinc alloy,"
00:34:46,00:34:49,that a guy called John Billings has patented.
00:34:49,00:34:53,And he is the guy who makes the Grammy Awards.
00:34:53,00:34:55,And he's made them for decades now.
00:34:55,00:34:58,And what I didn't realize was it's a little team
00:34:58,00:35:01,that assembles every year the Grammys.
00:35:01,00:35:05,And it's basically a one shop operation
00:35:05,00:35:07,"where not only do they make these Grammys,"
00:35:07,00:35:09,but then they put them in a van
00:35:09,00:35:12,"and they drive 2,000 or something miles across the country"
00:35:12,00:35:14,to deliver it personally.
00:35:14,00:35:16,John Billings himself would be sitting
00:35:16,00:35:18,in the car doing this.
00:35:18,00:35:20,And he is the Grammy man.
00:35:20,00:35:22,And it's-
00:35:22,00:35:24,- They use a strip map to get there.
00:35:24,00:35:25,So exciting.
00:35:25,00:35:27,"One year they went off course, it was a disaster,"
00:35:27,00:35:28,there were no Grammys.
00:35:29,00:35:30,"- Yeah. And it's, yeah."
00:35:30,00:35:33,"So this guy, he joined when he was quite young."
00:35:33,00:35:35,There was a previous person making the Grammys.
00:35:35,00:35:36,"And since he took over,"
00:35:36,00:35:39,"he changed the design of the Grammys,"
00:35:39,00:35:40,which is what they are today.
00:35:40,00:35:44,"And he also came up with this new, stronger alloy"
00:35:44,00:35:46,because all of the other previous Grammys
00:35:46,00:35:48,were quite flimsy and would break.
00:35:48,00:35:50,"And he thought this needs to be, you know-"
00:35:50,00:35:51,- Did they actually break?
00:35:51,00:35:52,Did people take Grammys home
00:35:52,00:35:54,and then you put them down and it just comes?
00:35:54,00:35:55,"- They still do, yeah."
00:35:55,00:35:55,- They still break.
00:35:55,00:35:56,- But they broke a lot more easy.
00:35:56,00:35:58,"I think it was so the Grammys,"
00:35:58,00:35:59,"if you don't know what they are,"
00:35:59,00:36:03,it is a Grammophone that is the shape of the trophy.
00:36:03,00:36:03,And so obviously-
00:36:03,00:36:06,- And I suppose it's a music award in America as the other.
00:36:06,00:36:07,"- Yeah, yeah."
00:36:07,00:36:09,It's the biggest music award in America.
00:36:09,00:36:12,And the trophy is in the shape of a Grammophone.
00:36:12,00:36:15,And it was particularly the arm that was with the stylus
00:36:15,00:36:16,on the end that was particularly flimsy.
00:36:16,00:36:19,And that was the bit when he redesigned it
00:36:19,00:36:20,that he wanted to get stronger.
00:36:20,00:36:24,"- Adele, the singer once snapped part of her Grammy on stage."
00:36:24,00:36:27,She dropped it on stage and broke part of it off.
00:36:27,00:36:31,"And in 2010, Taylor Swift was carrying four Grammys"
00:36:31,00:36:34,and she dropped one of them and it broke into pieces.
00:36:34,00:36:37,"And what happens is when it breaks into pieces,"
00:36:37,00:36:39,you send it back and they fix it for you.
00:36:39,00:36:41,Mr. Billings fix it for you.
00:36:41,00:36:44,But she wrote oops on the side of the one she broke
00:36:44,00:36:48,"and he now has that in his office on the side,"
00:36:48,00:36:51,a Taylor Swift broken Grammy and he gave her a new one.
00:36:51,00:36:52,- That's great.
00:36:52,00:36:55,"I wonder if she broke the, so the Grammys that we see-"
00:36:55,00:36:56,- The stunt.
00:36:56,00:36:57,- There are stunt Grammys.
00:36:57,00:36:59,- And that's what he drives across the country as well.
00:36:59,00:37:01,He drives the stunt ones across the country.
00:37:01,00:37:04,That drives them back as well before and after each.
00:37:04,00:37:05,"- Sorry, what is a stunt Grammy?"
00:37:05,00:37:06,- A stunt Grammy is the one-
00:37:06,00:37:07,- It's one that can do amazing tricks.
00:37:07,00:37:10,"So it throws us other skyscrapers, tightrope walks."
00:37:10,00:37:12,- So the idea is that the real Grammys
00:37:12,00:37:14,"are going to be given to everyone who's won them,"
00:37:14,00:37:17,need to have their name put on it and so on.
00:37:17,00:37:18,And they can't do that on the night.
00:37:18,00:37:21,So he drives the fake Grammys that you see them holding
00:37:21,00:37:23,at the award ceremony and then they give them back
00:37:23,00:37:25,and then the real Grammy.
00:37:25,00:37:27,- So those are not real Grammys?
00:37:27,00:37:27,"- Well, they're obviously-"
00:37:27,00:37:30,"- Well, they used every single year."
00:37:30,00:37:31,The same ones are used every year.
00:37:31,00:37:33,"So if you get a Grammy next year, Andy,"
00:37:33,00:37:35,which I'm sure you're hoping for.
00:37:35,00:37:37,- I'm trying.
00:37:37,00:37:39,- You will get one that might have been had by Adele
00:37:39,00:37:42,a few years ago or by Taylor Swift or whatever.
00:37:42,00:37:44,"'Cause when he gets the stunt Grammys home,"
00:37:44,00:37:46,he cleans them with washing up liquid
00:37:46,00:37:48,to get rid of any fingerprints or anything like that.
00:37:48,00:37:50,And then just puts them into storage.
00:37:50,00:37:52,And then the next year he takes them back.
00:37:52,00:37:53,- Nice.
00:37:53,00:37:56,"- So he just, every year drives a load of Grammys"
00:37:56,00:37:58,across America then drives them back the other way?
00:37:58,00:38:00,"- Yeah, you would think he would have a storage unit"
00:38:00,00:38:01,where he could just leave them.
00:38:01,00:38:03,- Does seem like that would be sensible.
00:38:03,00:38:04,"- It would be in the fishin', wouldn't it?"
00:38:04,00:38:05,- Yeah.
00:38:05,00:38:08,- And then what does he do with the actual one?
00:38:08,00:38:10,"Sorry, does he then post them out first class?"
00:38:10,00:38:12,- I think he might also drive those ones as well.
00:38:12,00:38:14,- But then does he has to drive on every single home
00:38:14,00:38:16,of every single Grammy winner?
00:38:16,00:38:18,"- No, I'm sure he takes them to Mr. Grammy"
00:38:18,00:38:20,who then hands them over to the people.
00:38:20,00:38:21,"- There's a distribution network, he thinks."
00:38:21,00:38:22,"- Yeah, yeah, I think so."
00:38:22,00:38:23,- There will be someone--
00:38:23,00:38:25,- There's a GDPR issue if he knows
00:38:25,00:38:26,where all these people live as well.
00:38:26,00:38:28,- That would be an amazing bit of information to have.
00:38:28,00:38:29,Just all the addresses
00:38:29,00:38:31,of all the most famous musicians in the world.
00:38:31,00:38:33,"- Yeah, so the Grammys."
00:38:33,00:38:36,This is a thing that started in the late 1950s
00:38:36,00:38:40,and the idea behind it was that they wanted to have
00:38:40,00:38:44,something that represented the output of musicians.
00:38:44,00:38:46,It was called the Grammy because they had a competition
00:38:46,00:38:48,where they asked the Americans what do you wanna call this?
00:38:48,00:38:50,And I think it was a girl who wrote in
00:38:50,00:38:53,"and said these trophies are made out of Grammys,"
00:38:53,00:38:55,so why don't we call it Grammys?
00:38:55,00:38:57,(laughing)
00:38:57,00:38:59,"- She was, she, a bunch of people suggested it,"
00:38:59,00:39:01,but she was the first person who's later got read
00:39:01,00:39:02,with the suggestion of Grammy.
00:39:02,00:39:04,- I think she was a New Orleans secretary
00:39:04,00:39:05,called Rose Trey Elizabeth Danner.
00:39:05,00:39:09,And she was given 25 free LPs as a gift
00:39:09,00:39:11,'cause lots of people are interested in Grammy
00:39:11,00:39:12,but her letter was open first.
00:39:12,00:39:15,"But she lived until February, 2014."
00:39:15,00:39:19,So she could have seen Robin Thickey performing Blurred Lines.
00:39:19,00:39:20,(laughing)
00:39:20,00:39:22,- Robin Thickey.
00:39:22,00:39:23,"- Yeah, I used to call him that."
00:39:23,00:39:26,"And I now, on principle, refuse to call him Robin"
00:39:26,00:39:27,by any other name.
00:39:27,00:39:30,"- I reckon if you were at school with Robin Thickey,"
00:39:30,00:39:32,that's what you would call him.
00:39:32,00:39:33,"- Oh, what a Thickey."
00:39:33,00:39:36,- There have been some pretty tedious decisions
00:39:36,00:39:38,"from the Grammy board over the years, haven't there?"
00:39:38,00:39:39,- It feels like you've got a few of them.
00:39:39,00:39:40,"Just leave there, Anna."
00:39:40,00:39:42,"- Well, I was reading an article written in 1993."
00:39:42,00:39:45,So some of these wrongs have been corrected now.
00:39:45,00:39:48,"But even so, a New York Times article written in 1993"
00:39:48,00:39:51,about how they just never seemed to pick the right people.
00:39:51,00:39:56,"So by 1993, here are people who hadn't won a Grammy."
00:39:56,00:39:58,"Eric Clapton, The Beach Boys, The Supremes,"
00:39:58,00:39:59,"The Grateful Dead, The Jackson Five,"
00:39:59,00:40:03,"Led Zeppelin, Etta James, Queen, Van Morrison."
00:40:03,00:40:04,- The Queen.
00:40:04,00:40:06,"- The Queen, the Queen has won the Grammys every year,"
00:40:06,00:40:09,"of course, lovely voice."
00:40:09,00:40:10,"Jimi Hendrix and The Rolling Stones,"
00:40:10,00:40:13,the only Grammy they ever won was Lifetime Achievement.
00:40:13,00:40:15,"At that point, 'cause they sometimes do this thing"
00:40:15,00:40:16,"where I think the judges think years afterwards,"
00:40:16,00:40:18,"oh, shit, they did turn out to be really good."
00:40:18,00:40:19,So then they toss a light.
00:40:19,00:40:20,"- Oh, God, let's have it."
00:40:20,00:40:21,- We forgot that.
00:40:21,00:40:22,(laughing)
00:40:22,00:40:23,"- Those were busy years, though."
00:40:23,00:40:25,"We're talking about, in terms of rock, you know,"
00:40:25,00:40:27,"Hendrix would have been up against the Beatles,"
00:40:27,00:40:29,"up against, that was a crowd."
00:40:29,00:40:30,"- They didn't like rock, though."
00:40:30,00:40:31,That was always a thing with the Grammys.
00:40:31,00:40:34,They were almost set up as an antidote
00:40:34,00:40:36,"to what they considered was, I think,"
00:40:36,00:40:38,was called anti-music by the people
00:40:38,00:40:40,who wanted the Grammys to come about.
00:40:40,00:40:42,"They wanted to celebrate quality music,"
00:40:42,00:40:44,"not anti-music like R&B and rock,"
00:40:44,00:40:47,"which, it was like, this is a flash in the pan."
00:40:47,00:40:50,- The most Grammys is by George Salty.
00:40:50,00:40:51,- George Salty?
00:40:51,00:40:54,"- And Salty's ring, actually, has been twice voted"
00:40:54,00:40:57,the greatest recording ever made.
00:40:57,00:40:57,- What?
00:40:57,00:40:58,- I don't know if you know Salty's ring.
00:40:58,00:40:59,- No.
00:40:59,00:41:00,- No?
00:41:00,00:41:01,- His cycle?
00:41:01,00:41:02,His ring cycle?
00:41:02,00:41:03,(laughing)
00:41:03,00:41:04,"- It's Wagner, yeah."
00:41:04,00:41:07,"He's a conductor, and so he's conducted lots and lots"
00:41:07,00:41:08,"of things, won loads and loads of Grammys,"
00:41:08,00:41:11,won 31 as a recording artist.
00:41:11,00:41:15,"And yeah, Salty's ring is one of the greatest"
00:41:15,00:41:18,"musical pieces ever made, and it's not funny in any way."
00:41:18,00:41:23,And he was the conductor at the Covent Garden opera house.
00:41:23,00:41:25,"And when he first came here,"
00:41:25,00:41:27,"because obviously we're in Covent Garden at the moment,"
00:41:27,00:41:30,there was like a clique in Covent Garden
00:41:30,00:41:31,"that really, really hated him,"
00:41:31,00:41:34,"'cause they didn't like when new musical directors came in,"
00:41:34,00:41:35,they really hated it.
00:41:35,00:41:37,"And so when he first arrived,"
00:41:37,00:41:40,"people threw rotten vegetables at him in the street,"
00:41:40,00:41:43,and his car was vandalized outside Covent Garden Theater
00:41:43,00:41:46,where the word Salty must go
00:41:46,00:41:48,scratched into his paintwork.
00:41:48,00:41:50,"- Wow, that doesn't sound like the actions of opera fans."
00:41:50,00:41:53,"- Ah, it's just cliques, isn't it?"
00:41:53,00:41:54,"You know, it's just groups of people"
00:41:54,00:41:58,don't like outsiders coming in with their Salty ways.
00:41:58,00:42:01,- They called him the Screaming Skull.
00:42:01,00:42:02,"- Yeah, really?"
00:42:02,00:42:03,"- But I don't know if that,"
00:42:03,00:42:04,I don't think that was a criticism.
00:42:04,00:42:06,I think that was more like he was quite a vigorous man
00:42:06,00:42:08,and he was bald.
00:42:08,00:42:09,"But you know, conductors,"
00:42:09,00:42:12,they do a lot of like shouting and gesticulating.
00:42:12,00:42:13,"- Yeah, yeah."
00:42:13,00:42:14,- So Screaming Skull.
00:42:14,00:42:16,"- I really like the non-famous,"
00:42:16,00:42:17,"the non-televised Grammy categories,"
00:42:17,00:42:18,I just think they're great.
00:42:18,00:42:19,"'Cause there are so many,"
00:42:19,00:42:21,I didn't realize there are dozens and dozens of categories.
00:42:21,00:42:23,- But things like Best Tropical Latin Album
00:42:23,00:42:27,or Best Contemporary Christian Music Performance/Song.
00:42:27,00:42:29,And there is a screening committee
00:42:29,00:42:31,which assesses whether or not
00:42:31,00:42:33,"you are actually fitting into that category or not,"
00:42:33,00:42:34,"'cause it would be much easier, I think,"
00:42:34,00:42:37,to get a Grammy for some of these things where--
00:42:37,00:42:40,"- Yeah, but we can't put Led Zeppelin in the Christian--"
00:42:40,00:42:42,"- No, but we, the four of us,"
00:42:42,00:42:44,could make a tropical Latin album.
00:42:44,00:42:45,- Are we good?
00:42:45,00:42:46,"- Oh, I see."
00:42:46,00:42:47,- Just game the system that way
00:42:47,00:42:49,by entering some of the less popular categories.
00:42:49,00:42:52,- And would that be part of our Mississippi River oeuvre
00:42:52,00:42:54,or is the tropical Latin album like the follow-up?
00:42:54,00:42:58,"- I don't think you are even as in the tropics, is it?"
00:42:58,00:42:59,"- I don't think, no, I don't think it could be."
00:42:59,00:43:00,"- No, it's like not."
00:43:00,00:43:02,"- But okay, here's one we could win, Best Album Notes."
00:43:02,00:43:03,- Oh yeah.
00:43:03,00:43:04,- Which really feels like a--
00:43:04,00:43:05,- I know a winner of that.
00:43:05,00:43:09,"- Not personally, but I know someone who has won that award."
00:43:09,00:43:10,- Who?
00:43:10,00:43:11,- What are the album notes?
00:43:11,00:43:12,Are they the lyrics that you write in there?
00:43:12,00:43:14,- Do you know the sleeve notes that you used to get
00:43:14,00:43:15,in a CD or in an LP?
00:43:15,00:43:17,And young listeners would have completely--
00:43:17,00:43:18,"- Yeah, I do."
00:43:18,00:43:20,"Where you write Beyonce, I remember a Destiny's Child,"
00:43:20,00:43:21,they all wrote how much they loved God.
00:43:21,00:43:24,I found it so boring reading those things.
00:43:24,00:43:26,"- Well, they might not have won that year's Best Album Notes"
00:43:26,00:43:27,category.
00:43:27,00:43:28,"- Dan, who do you know?"
00:43:28,00:43:29,Who's been there?
00:43:29,00:43:30,"- Steve Martin, the comedian, has won them."
00:43:30,00:43:32,"- I bet he's written some really good album notes, yeah."
00:43:32,00:43:35,"- For his banjo albums, not for his comedy albums."
00:43:35,00:43:36,- You don't know. - It feels like
00:43:36,00:43:37,it played with strings.
00:43:37,00:43:38,- Do you know Steve Martin?
00:43:38,00:43:40,"- No, that's when I said I know someone,"
00:43:40,00:43:43,and then I qualified it by saying I don't know them.
00:43:43,00:43:44,- Right.
00:43:44,00:43:47,"So it was the last a statement was true, yeah."
00:43:47,00:43:48,- Is aware of.
00:43:48,00:43:49,"I know Robin Thickey, although I don't know"
00:43:49,00:43:50,how to say his name.
00:43:50,00:43:53,(all laughing)
00:43:53,00:43:56,- It's very controversial the way they vote in the Grammys.
00:43:56,00:43:59,"'Cause it's, well, until this year, it was super secret."
00:43:59,00:44:01,It sounds quite exciting.
00:44:01,00:44:04,And I think what used to happen was winners were decided
00:44:04,00:44:08,"by this like 12,000 strong recording Academy,"
00:44:08,00:44:12,"bunch of voters who, they're like."
00:44:12,00:44:13,(all laughing)
00:44:13,00:44:15,- They all stand in a room and put their hands up
00:44:15,00:44:16,"and stuff, right?"
00:44:16,00:44:21,"- Yeah, they crush in and, yeah, someone has to count them."
00:44:21,00:44:23,"They, I guess it's probably done by post"
00:44:23,00:44:24,and their musicians and music makers.
00:44:24,00:44:26,"- Probably you, Val, these days."
00:44:26,00:44:28,(all laughing)
00:44:28,00:44:31,- It was in the 90s that it changed.
00:44:31,00:44:32,"- John Billings goes around, gets them"
00:44:32,00:44:34,"in the back of the van, picks up the next one."
00:44:34,00:44:35,(all laughing)
00:44:35,00:44:37,- But that's just the fake ones that he brings.
00:44:37,00:44:39,(all laughing)
00:44:39,00:44:41,"So, yeah, it used to be done by this 12,000 strong"
00:44:41,00:44:43,and bunch of voters.
00:44:43,00:44:44,But then I think partly because the awards
00:44:44,00:44:47,just kept going so wrong and they just kept giving it
00:44:47,00:44:49,to weird people.
00:44:49,00:44:50,They had to change the rules.
00:44:50,00:44:51,And I think the straw that broke the camel's back
00:44:51,00:44:56,"came in the early 90s when over, album of the year was up"
00:44:56,00:44:59,"and Bruce Springsteen's ""Born in the USA"" was released"
00:44:59,00:45:01,"and ""Princess Purple Rain"" was released"
00:45:01,00:45:04,"and Lionel Richie's ""Can't Slow Down"" won."
00:45:04,00:45:06,"And everyone said, we didn't like that."
00:45:06,00:45:07,That's not as good as the other two.
00:45:07,00:45:10,And so they formed a secret committee
00:45:10,00:45:12,"which basically goes through all the 12,000 votes"
00:45:12,00:45:13,and takes out the duds.
00:45:13,00:45:15,- Because actually you would think
00:45:15,00:45:18,"that having a larger group, 12,000 would be more likely"
00:45:18,00:45:20,"to give you a democratic answer, right?"
00:45:20,00:45:21,"- Yeah, give you the best."
00:45:21,00:45:23,- But a democratic answer isn't necessarily
00:45:23,00:45:24,"the best answer, James."
00:45:24,00:45:24,- Is that not right?
00:45:24,00:45:25,- Okay.
00:45:25,00:45:27,- That's my view.
00:45:27,00:45:28,(all laughing)
00:45:28,00:45:31,- My one way ticket to Russia is just to come through.
00:45:31,00:45:34,"Anyway, people got quite pissed off"
00:45:34,00:45:35,by the secret committee
00:45:35,00:45:37,because no one knew how they voted or why they voted.
00:45:37,00:45:40,"And there's someone called The Weekend, I think."
00:45:40,00:45:41,"- Oh, The Weekend."
00:45:41,00:45:41,- The Weekend.
00:45:41,00:45:42,"- Oh, right."
00:45:42,00:45:44,(all laughing)
00:45:44,00:45:45,"Well, it's spelled The Weekend."
00:45:45,00:45:46,"- Weekend, yeah, yeah."
00:45:46,00:45:47,"- Yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:45:47,00:45:48,(all laughing)
00:45:48,00:45:49,"- They, he--"
00:45:49,00:45:50,"- Fred, the Robin picky, I believe."
00:45:50,00:45:51,(all laughing)
00:45:51,00:45:54,"- This show has certainly weakened over the years, hasn't it?"
00:45:54,00:45:55,(all laughing)
00:45:55,00:45:57,"- Yeah, so it's felt like Weekend."
00:45:57,00:45:59,"Anyway, but without any, so he--"
00:45:59,00:46:01,"- Well, with two E's."
00:46:01,00:46:03,(all laughing)
00:46:03,00:46:06,- But not three.
00:46:06,00:46:07,"Anyway, The Weekend got annoyed"
00:46:07,00:46:09,that he hadn't got nominated.
00:46:09,00:46:10,- He's pronounced the Weckend.
00:46:10,00:46:13,(all laughing)
00:46:13,00:46:15,"Ladies and gentlemen, The Weekend."
00:46:15,00:46:18,"- I just, I want a new podcast"
00:46:18,00:46:20,where we give Anna the name of all the partners
00:46:20,00:46:24,that are in the charts and see if she can pronounce them.
00:46:24,00:46:26,- They've asked me to read out the nominations next show.
00:46:26,00:46:27,- I'm quite nervous now.
00:46:27,00:46:29,- Lil Nas the 10th.
00:46:29,00:46:31,(all laughing)
00:46:31,00:46:34,"- I did another one, no, I know the Lil Nas is."
00:46:34,00:46:36,(upbeat music)
