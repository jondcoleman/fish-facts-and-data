00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580
 (upbeat music)

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:16.720
 - Hello and welcome to another episode

00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:20.020
 of No Such Thing as a Fish, a weekly podcast coming to you

00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:22.800
 from the QI offices in Covent Garden.

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:23.920
 My name is Dan Schreiber.

00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:27.360
 I am sitting here with Anna Tyshinski, Andrew Hunter Murray

00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:28.600
 and James Harkin.

00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:31.120
 And once again, we have gathered around the microphones

00:00:31.120 --> 00:00:34.320
 with our four favorite facts from the last seven days

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:37.820
 and in no particular order, here we go.

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:41.360
 Starting with fact number one, and that is Andy.

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:44.260
 - My fact is that if you took all the hedges in Britain

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:45.780
 and laid them end to end,

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:49.380
 they would stretch to the moon and most of the way back.

00:00:49.380 --> 00:00:51.120
 (laughing)

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:52.120
 - Not like that.

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:53.720
 - Grappy ending to that.

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:54.800
 (laughing)

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:56.220
 How far back?

00:00:56.220 --> 00:00:58.640
 - Basically, figures vary about the exact length,

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:00.560
 but it would definitely get you all the way there

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:03.240
 and it would definitely not get you all the way back.

00:01:03.240 --> 00:01:06.040
 - All the alien sheep that you're kind of herding

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:08.660
 into this gap between the earth and the moon,

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:11.080
 they'd be able to escape from that last little gap.

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:11.920
 - I don't think they would

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:14.940
 because there's one layer of hedging solidly between the two.

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:17.080
 - Yeah, but the thing is with fences,

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:19.000
 you need them on both sides of a field.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:21.440
 - Yes, what I stupidly imagined is a sort of double row

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:23.320
 of hedging that runs out halfway back,

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:25.440
 but you don't actually, you don't need that.

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:28.580
 - Basically, the UK has about 700,000 kilometers of hedges.

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:31.620
 Some people say there are only about 500,000 kilometers

00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:33.700
 of hedges, so the figures do vary,

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:37.340
 but it definitely is between one and two times the distance

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:39.680
 between the earth and the moon, right?

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:43.580
 That's quite a big discrepancy, 200,000 kilometers.

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:45.820
 - Yeah, I mean, it's quite hard to survey.

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:47.260
 There are quite good ways of measuring now,

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:49.740
 as in you can use satellites to measure the distances.

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:50.780
 - Who has the time, though,

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:54.300
 to go through all the hedges from satellite imagery?

00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:56.240
 - It feels like you have the answer to that question.

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:57.400
 I know you're just teaming me up.

00:01:57.400 --> 00:01:58.880
 (all laughing)

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:01.080
 - And with that, James, quit the podcast

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:03.140
 to start his hedge measuring career.

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:05.600
 - I was just thinking that I think

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:06.840
 if you have satellite imagery,

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:08.920
 there's more important things to do than work out

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:11.640
 whether it's 200,000 or 300,000 or whatever it was.

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:12.640
 - It's true, it's true.

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:13.840
 - I'm saying this, by the way,

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:15.380
 as someone who has been active

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:17.160
 in the hedge community in the past.

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:18.000
 - What do you mean?

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.440
 - When I lived in the countryside in the Lake District,

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:23.080
 when I moved in, one of the first people to come around

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:25.400
 was a couple saying, would you be interested

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:27.200
 in getting involved with the hedges?

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:28.040
 - Right.

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:29.700
 - And it does sound like a swinging case,

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:30.540
 but it certainly was.

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:32.260
 (all laughing)

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:34.660
 - Basically, in Silverdale, where I lived,

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:36.260
 so it's just outside the Lake District,

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:38.200
 the hedges were very important

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:39.840
 'cause they have a lot of wildlife,

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:42.100
 and we wanted to save them.

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:44.180
 I only went to one or two meetings.

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:46.260
 - So what happened at those meetings?

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:47.980
 - Part of it, you might go around

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:49.660
 picking stuff out of the hedges,

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:51.540
 like cleaning the hedges and stuff.

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:53.240
 But mostly, you're just trying to stop people

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:54.680
 from cutting the hedges down.

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:57.040
 - Or just vigilante wandering the countryside,

00:02:57.040 --> 00:02:59.320
 throwing yourselves at farmers.

00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:00.800
 - That was probably in the third meeting,

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:02.440
 but all that stuff happened.

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:04.560
 Like the Extinction Rebellion side of it,

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:05.760
 I think that came later.

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:07.560
 It was mostly just chatting about hedges.

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:10.200
 - Was it, James, the National Hedge Laying Society?

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:12.720
 - I don't recall very well, but I don't think so.

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:14.000
 It was a long time ago, this.

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:15.440
 - There are a few different hedge bodies.

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:16.360
 - Yeah.

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:20.680
 - But isn't this the one grand daddy body of hedging?

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:22.780
 - I mean, the National Hedge Laying Society are huge.

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:24.320
 - You wanted to talk about hedge laying, then, Andy,

00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:25.500
 which is different, of course,

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:27.820
 to James's hedge rubbish clearance.

00:03:27.820 --> 00:03:29.220
 - The National Hedge Laying Society

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:30.740
 and the National Hedge Maintenance Society

00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:33.660
 are the jets and the sharks of the hedge world.

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:35.060
 Vicious, vicious knife fights

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:36.660
 between them whenever they meet.

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:38.100
 Life on the hedge.

00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:38.940
 - God.

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:40.740
 - But it is really cool hedge laying.

00:03:40.740 --> 00:03:42.460
 I didn't know about it.

00:03:42.460 --> 00:03:44.180
 I didn't know what it was.

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:48.300
 And it is literally making a hedge lie down, isn't it?

00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:50.660
 It's flaccidating a hedge, essentially.

00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:52.480
 - So the hedge pre-exists.

00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:55.320
 - A hedge has to pre-exist to lay a hedge, yes.

00:03:55.320 --> 00:03:57.720
 Otherwise, you're just building a hedge, I guess.

00:03:57.720 --> 00:03:59.120
 - So that's what I got confused about.

00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:00.520
 I thought you have to plant a hedge, don't you?

00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:01.360
 - Yeah, that's what I thought.

00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:02.320
 - Well, you're planting a hedge

00:04:02.320 --> 00:04:03.840
 into an already existing hedge.

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:06.840
 So, basically, this is a way of maintaining the hedges,

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:08.640
 which is very important that we do,

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:10.200
 'cause they're so bi-diverse and stuff.

00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:13.520
 And so you've got to stop them growing too high, too tall,

00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:15.400
 because if the trees that make up a hedge

00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:18.080
 turn into mature trees, then they eventually die.

00:04:18.080 --> 00:04:19.960
 And also, they're trunks shoot up

00:04:19.960 --> 00:04:21.220
 and they don't have any foliage at the bottom

00:04:21.220 --> 00:04:22.500
 and there are big gaps in the hedge

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:23.940
 and all the sheep get through.

00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:26.700
 And so what hedge laying is, it's really clever,

00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:29.980
 you turn the hedge from vertical to horizontal, essentially.

00:04:29.980 --> 00:04:33.820
 So you do this by kind of cutting the upright trunks

00:04:33.820 --> 00:04:37.820
 at the base, so you make a little slit in the upright trunk.

00:04:37.820 --> 00:04:39.860
 But you don't cut it all the way down to the bottom,

00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:41.140
 'cause you really don't wanna kill the trunk.

00:04:41.140 --> 00:04:43.060
 You gotta keep the sap flowing up it.

00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:45.900
 And when you split it, you can bend it over,

00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:49.100
 as you can imagine, like a hinge so that it lies down.

00:04:49.100 --> 00:04:50.720
 And then when you do that,

00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:54.160
 then it will start growing new hedgery upwards.

00:04:54.160 --> 00:04:55.880
 So you've got to keep on bending it over

00:04:55.880 --> 00:04:58.240
 so a new youthful bit shoots up.

00:04:58.240 --> 00:04:59.560
 - That's very clever, that's great, I didn't know that.

00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:00.920
 - And it's called "pleaching."

00:05:00.920 --> 00:05:01.760
 - "Pleaching."

00:05:01.760 --> 00:05:03.080
 - The "pleach" and the "ligger" is the bit

00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:05.360
 on the hedge that's horizontal, if you ever wanna.

00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:06.880
 - Wow, that's good new words.

00:05:06.880 --> 00:05:07.720
 - "Pleaching" and "liggering."

00:05:07.720 --> 00:05:08.560
 - "Pleaching."

00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:10.280
 Most hedges I've seen in the photos

00:05:10.280 --> 00:05:11.120
 while researching this,

00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:12.800
 they sort of look like they've been blown

00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:15.000
 to a 45 degree angle by the wind.

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:17.320
 - It's very controversial, the angle at which you should

00:05:17.320 --> 00:05:20.500
 put it, and there are 35 different types of hedge laying,

00:05:20.500 --> 00:05:23.340
 and people say 30 degrees, 45 occasionally.

00:05:23.340 --> 00:05:24.900
 I don't know where you saw this hedge.

00:05:24.900 --> 00:05:27.500
 - It was on actually the official bodies website, so.

00:05:27.500 --> 00:05:30.200
 - Right, so they've made a statement with that angle.

00:05:30.200 --> 00:05:31.040
 - It's a good website, isn't it?

00:05:31.040 --> 00:05:32.900
 The National Hedge Laying Bodies website.

00:05:32.900 --> 00:05:37.900
 - I think that's being very kind, it's nice, it's pleasant.

00:05:37.900 --> 00:05:39.940
 - Wow.

00:05:39.940 --> 00:05:42.380
 - What do you think were its main drawbacks?

00:05:42.380 --> 00:05:43.780
 - To be honest, I looked at it and thought I might

00:05:43.780 --> 00:05:45.940
 get in touch and just give some suggestions.

00:05:45.940 --> 00:05:48.720
 I thought there was a lot of information missing.

00:05:48.720 --> 00:05:52.200
 There was a lot of, yeah, there was a lot more they could do

00:05:52.200 --> 00:05:55.160
 with their annual award for best hedge.

00:05:55.160 --> 00:05:56.000
 - What could they do?

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:59.600
 - More photos, more understanding of what had happened.

00:05:59.600 --> 00:06:01.360
 If you're a novice, like me coming to it.

00:06:01.360 --> 00:06:03.040
 - Like match reports, 'cause they do have

00:06:03.040 --> 00:06:05.160
 an annual championship, you're right, yeah, yeah.

00:06:05.160 --> 00:06:06.840
 - Yeah, the National Hedge Laying Championship.

00:06:06.840 --> 00:06:08.280
 - I did want a bit more pros, actually,

00:06:08.280 --> 00:06:11.280
 of what had happened in each year's championships.

00:06:11.280 --> 00:06:12.440
 They just give us the kind of winners

00:06:12.440 --> 00:06:13.280
 and the runners up.

00:06:13.280 --> 00:06:14.840
 - Can I, sorry, can I just ask a question?

00:06:14.840 --> 00:06:17.340
 Is it for the person who's best at bending the hedges

00:06:17.340 --> 00:06:19.060
 or is it for the actual best hedge?

00:06:19.060 --> 00:06:19.900
 - Great question.

00:06:19.900 --> 00:06:21.640
 I would have loved to have got the answer

00:06:21.640 --> 00:06:22.740
 as I read the website.

00:06:22.740 --> 00:06:24.360
 - I did get the answer from the website

00:06:24.360 --> 00:06:26.000
 because it's the former.

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:29.200
 It's not the best, it's the person who's laying the hedge.

00:06:29.200 --> 00:06:30.040
 - Yeah.

00:06:30.040 --> 00:06:31.700
 - You have to scroll down, so there's a bar

00:06:31.700 --> 00:06:32.940
 at the side of the website often

00:06:32.940 --> 00:06:35.100
 and you get the down arrow at the bottom.

00:06:35.100 --> 00:06:35.940
 - Is that what it is?

00:06:35.940 --> 00:06:37.420
 - You get more, it's like turning a page

00:06:37.420 --> 00:06:39.700
 but on your laptop, it's amazing.

00:06:39.700 --> 00:06:42.220
 - 'Cause I presume like hedges are hundreds,

00:06:42.220 --> 00:06:43.940
 if not thousands of years old, right?

00:06:43.940 --> 00:06:46.540
 And they don't change that much from year to year.

00:06:46.540 --> 00:06:49.280
 So whatever's the best hedge in 2019 is likely

00:06:49.280 --> 00:06:52.000
 to be the best hedge in 2020 and 2021.

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:54.360
 Do you know how to tell how old a hedge is?

00:06:54.360 --> 00:06:55.200
 No.

00:06:55.200 --> 00:06:56.040
 - Ask it nicely.

00:06:56.040 --> 00:06:56.960
 - There's a thing called Hooper's Rule.

00:06:56.960 --> 00:06:59.360
 No, it's very rude to ask a hedge its age.

00:06:59.360 --> 00:07:00.600
 - Oh, right, good to know.

00:07:00.600 --> 00:07:01.980
 - There's a thing called Hooper's Rule.

00:07:01.980 --> 00:07:04.120
 It's named after a guy called M.D. Hooper,

00:07:04.120 --> 00:07:05.760
 who is one of the people who invented it.

00:07:05.760 --> 00:07:09.480
 And you take a 30-yard stretch of hedge,

00:07:09.480 --> 00:07:12.080
 you count the number of species in it,

00:07:12.080 --> 00:07:17.080
 you multiply that number by 110 and then you add 30 years.

00:07:17.080 --> 00:07:20.820
 And that will tell you exactly how old a hedge is

00:07:20.820 --> 00:07:22.340
 and it's called Hooper's Rule.

00:07:22.340 --> 00:07:26.020
 And it was published in the '70s and almost immediately,

00:07:26.020 --> 00:07:28.860
 someone else did a publication saying it's complete bollocks.

00:07:28.860 --> 00:07:30.900
 (laughing)

00:07:30.900 --> 00:07:32.980
 At very best, it can give you an approximation

00:07:32.980 --> 00:07:36.340
 and you should always use village or council

00:07:36.340 --> 00:07:38.700
 or parish history.

00:07:38.700 --> 00:07:40.180
 - Also, that's gonna be a hell of a lot quicker

00:07:40.180 --> 00:07:41.660
 than counting meticulously.

00:07:41.660 --> 00:07:43.840
 All the species in a hedge.

00:07:43.840 --> 00:07:45.120
 - There's a guy, and this was in the article

00:07:45.120 --> 00:07:47.160
 that you sent Andy, where you found your fact from,

00:07:47.160 --> 00:07:50.000
 where he spent two years, he's a British ecologist,

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:51.960
 spent two years looking at all of the species

00:07:51.960 --> 00:07:54.200
 inside one particular bit of hedgerow.

00:07:54.200 --> 00:07:57.760
 And he counted 2,070 in total over those years.

00:07:57.760 --> 00:07:58.920
 And this is not the wood.

00:07:58.920 --> 00:08:02.640
 This is like little ants and animals and so on.

00:08:02.640 --> 00:08:04.400
 - And he's amazing.

00:08:04.400 --> 00:08:07.080
 Robert Walton, he was challenged during a car journey

00:08:07.080 --> 00:08:09.520
 by another friend of his, another naturalist.

00:08:09.520 --> 00:08:11.040
 Not sure what the exact terms of the challenge were,

00:08:11.040 --> 00:08:13.300
 but it's basically why didn't you study that hedge

00:08:13.300 --> 00:08:14.300
 for a very long time?

00:08:14.300 --> 00:08:15.140
 (laughing)

00:08:15.140 --> 00:08:16.340
 And he spent a year on it and he's like,

00:08:16.340 --> 00:08:18.660
 "God, I'm still getting loads every single week."

00:08:18.660 --> 00:08:21.180
 So he spent another, spent a second year on it.

00:08:21.180 --> 00:08:22.020
 It was incredible.

00:08:22.020 --> 00:08:23.620
 He reckoned there were more than 3,000,

00:08:23.620 --> 00:08:24.740
 but he could only count 2,000

00:08:24.740 --> 00:08:25.940
 'cause they were with the naked eye

00:08:25.940 --> 00:08:27.540
 that he was looking at them.

00:08:27.540 --> 00:08:29.340
 2,000 species is the most detailed study

00:08:29.340 --> 00:08:30.460
 of a hedge ever made.

00:08:30.460 --> 00:08:32.340
 Ever.

00:08:32.340 --> 00:08:33.980
 I can't believe no one else has done this.

00:08:33.980 --> 00:08:35.140
 - Yeah, I know, it's weird, isn't it?

00:08:35.140 --> 00:08:35.980
 Well, that's what he was saying.

00:08:35.980 --> 00:08:36.940
 It's bizarre how important they are

00:08:36.940 --> 00:08:39.940
 that we know so little about what's in them, in a way.

00:08:39.940 --> 00:08:41.880
 And also, they've been quite denigrated hedges.

00:08:41.880 --> 00:08:43.800
 They've had a bad rep for ages.

00:08:43.800 --> 00:08:45.240
 Definitely, when I was growing up,

00:08:45.240 --> 00:08:49.280
 I thought that the hedge was often quite new, right?

00:08:49.280 --> 00:08:51.040
 'Cause you learned about enclosure.

00:08:51.040 --> 00:08:52.000
 This is the big deal.

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:53.320
 God, it's drilled into you at school.

00:08:53.320 --> 00:08:55.720
 Enclosure, agricultural revolution.

00:08:55.720 --> 00:08:57.240
 You build hedges all around the fields

00:08:57.240 --> 00:08:58.440
 and there's this common misconception

00:08:58.440 --> 00:09:00.360
 and it's still on loads of sites today

00:09:00.360 --> 00:09:02.480
 that the hedges just came up in enclosure

00:09:02.480 --> 00:09:04.280
 when the landowners locked off their fields.

00:09:04.280 --> 00:09:06.080
 - I don't think every listener's gonna know about enclosure.

00:09:06.080 --> 00:09:07.160
 I think we should say a bit.

00:09:07.160 --> 00:09:09.040
 - No, that's, if you don't remember,

00:09:09.040 --> 00:09:12.820
 if you're not English and don't remember your year A history.

00:09:12.820 --> 00:09:13.660
 - So what is it?

00:09:13.660 --> 00:09:14.580
 I don't know this.

00:09:14.580 --> 00:09:15.820
 - In the agricultural revolution,

00:09:15.820 --> 00:09:20.220
 landowners decided to end the common land usage policies

00:09:20.220 --> 00:09:21.180
 that have been existing so far

00:09:21.180 --> 00:09:22.860
 where everyone could graze their animals and plant

00:09:22.860 --> 00:09:24.260
 when they wanted to do common land

00:09:24.260 --> 00:09:27.100
 and they enclose their land with fences and hedges.

00:09:27.100 --> 00:09:29.780
 And that's where a lot of people think,

00:09:29.780 --> 00:09:31.620
 this grand misconception arises,

00:09:31.620 --> 00:09:33.020
 that hedges were all planted.

00:09:33.020 --> 00:09:34.700
 So loads of hedges in the south of England

00:09:34.700 --> 00:09:36.580
 do come from the 17th and 18th century.

00:09:36.580 --> 00:09:40.960
 - You basically cut down the entire of year eight history

00:09:40.960 --> 00:09:42.480
 into about two sentences.

00:09:42.480 --> 00:09:43.320
 - There we go.

00:09:43.320 --> 00:09:44.320
 And now I've told you it's wrong.

00:09:44.320 --> 00:09:45.160
 (laughing)

00:09:45.160 --> 00:09:46.480
 They're all really old.

00:09:46.480 --> 00:09:47.320
 - Wow.

00:09:47.320 --> 00:09:48.680
 Welcome to year nine, bitches.

00:09:48.680 --> 00:09:50.160
 (laughing)

00:09:50.160 --> 00:09:51.700
 Everything is a lie.

00:09:51.700 --> 00:09:53.160
 - Forget what you heard.

00:09:53.160 --> 00:09:54.040
 - Like me in year eight,

00:09:54.040 --> 00:09:55.960
 I still stopped listening half way through.

00:09:55.960 --> 00:09:57.360
 What was I saying?

00:09:57.360 --> 00:09:59.320
 - Guarantee you can't find enclosure

00:09:59.320 --> 00:10:00.760
 10 seconds after hearing about it.

00:10:00.760 --> 00:10:02.280
 And so people thought we could cut them down

00:10:02.280 --> 00:10:03.120
 'cause they're new,

00:10:03.120 --> 00:10:05.480
 so they weren't part of the intrinsic landscape

00:10:05.480 --> 00:10:06.560
 that's full of these amazing,

00:10:06.560 --> 00:10:07.380
 ecosystem.

00:10:07.380 --> 00:10:09.740
 - A lot of them are like between parishes,

00:10:09.740 --> 00:10:10.580
 for instance,

00:10:10.580 --> 00:10:12.780
 which goes back thousands of years.

00:10:12.780 --> 00:10:14.340
 And even before that,

00:10:14.340 --> 00:10:16.740
 just people when we first got the sheep's over,

00:10:16.740 --> 00:10:19.740
 just trying to keep your sheep in one place kind of thing.

00:10:19.740 --> 00:10:22.060
 - They kind of function as motorways for species.

00:10:22.060 --> 00:10:24.420
 Mice get around the countryside on them.

00:10:24.420 --> 00:10:25.860
 The animals use them for navigation.

00:10:25.860 --> 00:10:27.780
 The birds nesting,

00:10:27.780 --> 00:10:29.660
 it's really vital that they exist.

00:10:29.660 --> 00:10:32.420
 And the UK destroyed about half of its hedging

00:10:32.420 --> 00:10:33.820
 in the 20th century.

00:10:33.820 --> 00:10:35.260
 So you would have been able to get to the moon

00:10:35.260 --> 00:10:36.260
 and back again.

00:10:36.260 --> 00:10:38.340
 And then maybe to the moon again,

00:10:38.340 --> 00:10:40.320
 in the good old days in the 1930s.

00:10:40.320 --> 00:10:42.280
 And the reason the UK destroyed half of its hedging,

00:10:42.280 --> 00:10:44.300
 give or take is because of Hitler.

00:10:44.300 --> 00:10:46.260
 - Oh, he always gets the blame, doesn't he?

00:10:46.260 --> 00:10:47.100
 - Get into that give or take.

00:10:47.100 --> 00:10:49.480
 - More I hear about that man.

00:10:49.480 --> 00:10:51.500
 - So the UK wanted to be quite food sufficient

00:10:51.500 --> 00:10:52.680
 after the Second World War,

00:10:52.680 --> 00:10:55.020
 because there had been a few problems

00:10:55.020 --> 00:10:57.720
 with food supplies during the war.

00:10:57.720 --> 00:10:59.800
 And so various governments incentivized farmers

00:10:59.800 --> 00:11:01.540
 to make their fields much bigger,

00:11:01.540 --> 00:11:03.800
 remove the hedges, join them all up,

00:11:03.800 --> 00:11:06.760
 just so you could grow larger amounts of crops.

00:11:06.760 --> 00:11:07.960
 And they were actually incentivized.

00:11:07.960 --> 00:11:10.200
 Farmers were paid to get rid of their hedges.

00:11:10.200 --> 00:11:12.280
 And only in the last 20 years,

00:11:12.280 --> 00:11:13.860
 I think has it been truly appreciated

00:11:13.860 --> 00:11:17.040
 just what a lot of damage this did to biodiversity

00:11:17.040 --> 00:11:18.240
 and all sorts of things.

00:11:18.240 --> 00:11:21.960
 And so now there are aims to build many more hedges,

00:11:21.960 --> 00:11:23.380
 not only to fight climate change,

00:11:23.380 --> 00:11:25.000
 but to build biodiversity.

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:26.880
 - And against the Nazis.

00:11:26.880 --> 00:11:29.280
 - And to just keep the Nazis down,

00:11:29.280 --> 00:11:31.080
 just to stop and coming back.

00:11:31.080 --> 00:11:32.920
 - Do you want some other hedge words, by the way?

00:11:32.920 --> 00:11:33.760
 - Oh yeah.

00:11:33.760 --> 00:11:35.320
 - See, that is giving us some great hedge words.

00:11:35.320 --> 00:11:37.120
 These are actually words in the OED

00:11:37.120 --> 00:11:39.440
 that have the word hedge in them.

00:11:39.440 --> 00:11:43.080
 So to hedge hop, you know what hedge hopping is?

00:11:43.080 --> 00:11:46.160
 - Is that to, there's a field of hedgehogs

00:11:46.160 --> 00:11:47.800
 and you're not allowed to touch the ground.

00:11:47.800 --> 00:11:49.360
 It's like the floor is lava.

00:11:49.360 --> 00:11:50.200
 - It's a game.

00:11:50.200 --> 00:11:51.640
 - Yeah, you have to get to the other side.

00:11:51.640 --> 00:11:53.400
 - Trampling a hedgehog with every bound.

00:11:53.400 --> 00:11:55.640
 - I'm not saying it's a nice game, I'm just saying.

00:11:55.640 --> 00:11:57.240
 - Again, once you've torn the hedges down,

00:11:57.240 --> 00:11:59.320
 why don't you do this hedgehog trampling game?

00:11:59.320 --> 00:12:01.080
 - It's not that, thankfully.

00:12:01.080 --> 00:12:03.520
 It's a colloquial term for flying your aircraft

00:12:03.520 --> 00:12:04.800
 at a very low level,

00:12:04.800 --> 00:12:06.760
 so as if you're hopping over hedges.

00:12:06.760 --> 00:12:08.080
 - Oh, nice, lovely, got it.

00:12:08.080 --> 00:12:10.640
 - Hedge wine is very poor quality wine.

00:12:10.640 --> 00:12:14.000
 And in fact, hedge is used to mean poor quality.

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:17.280
 And also hedge wench, do you know what a hedge wench is?

00:12:17.280 --> 00:12:20.280
 - Well, a wench is a lusty woman.

00:12:20.280 --> 00:12:22.120
 - And hedge is poor quality.

00:12:22.120 --> 00:12:23.920
 So it's a poor quality lusty woman.

00:12:23.920 --> 00:12:24.760
 (laughing)

00:12:24.760 --> 00:12:26.280
 - This is a bit more literal.

00:12:26.280 --> 00:12:29.280
 It's a sex worker who plays their trade in a hedge.

00:12:29.280 --> 00:12:30.120
 - Oh, golly.

00:12:30.120 --> 00:12:32.280
 - That's a painful, are people paying extra for that?

00:12:32.280 --> 00:12:34.520
 Or are you going to get a prickle?

00:12:34.520 --> 00:12:35.360
 - In a hedge.

00:12:35.360 --> 00:12:36.560
 - In a hedge, yeah.

00:12:36.560 --> 00:12:38.160
 - We could go back to my place actually,

00:12:38.160 --> 00:12:39.160
 just think about it now.

00:12:39.160 --> 00:12:40.800
 (laughing)

00:12:40.800 --> 00:12:44.600
 I do think the hedge is going to detract from the experience.

00:12:44.600 --> 00:12:47.080
 There are 2,000 species and they're all watching at the moment

00:12:47.080 --> 00:12:47.920
 and I don't like it.

00:12:47.920 --> 00:12:49.400
 Oh, God.

00:12:49.400 --> 00:12:51.080
 - A lot of ants up the bum.

00:12:51.080 --> 00:12:53.040
 Do you know what this proverb means?

00:12:53.040 --> 00:12:56.040
 It's good sheltering under an old hedge.

00:12:56.040 --> 00:12:57.560
 It's a very old American proverb.

00:12:57.560 --> 00:12:59.640
 - Does it mean literally exactly what it sounds like?

00:12:59.640 --> 00:13:01.000
 (laughing)

00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:02.160
 If you find an old hedge,

00:13:02.160 --> 00:13:04.960
 you're probably going to be sheltered quite nicely.

00:13:04.960 --> 00:13:06.080
 - It sounds like it does.

00:13:06.080 --> 00:13:07.400
 It's actually more cryptic than that.

00:13:07.400 --> 00:13:10.240
 It means it's good to marry an older woman.

00:13:10.240 --> 00:13:12.040
 She's the old hedge.

00:13:12.040 --> 00:13:14.640
 Cause I guess she's more experienced.

00:13:14.640 --> 00:13:15.480
 - Thicker.

00:13:15.480 --> 00:13:18.240
 (laughing)

00:13:18.240 --> 00:13:19.520
 - She's been laid by many men before.

00:13:19.520 --> 00:13:21.760
 (laughing)

00:13:21.760 --> 00:13:24.340
 (upbeat music)

00:13:24.340 --> 00:13:28.800
 - Okay, it is time for fact number two

00:13:28.800 --> 00:13:30.520
 and that is Anna.

00:13:30.520 --> 00:13:32.840
 - My fact this week is that in the 1940s,

00:13:32.840 --> 00:13:35.840
 prisoners of war in the US helped build a model

00:13:35.840 --> 00:13:37.240
 of the Mississippi basin

00:13:37.240 --> 00:13:40.160
 that was about twice the size of the Vatican.

00:13:40.160 --> 00:13:41.480
 - Wow.

00:13:41.480 --> 00:13:43.920
 - God, it's actually so many elements in that fact

00:13:43.920 --> 00:13:45.680
 that I'd be impressed if you got to the end of it.

00:13:45.680 --> 00:13:46.520
 But.

00:13:46.520 --> 00:13:49.120
 - So I don't know what a model of the Mississippi basin was

00:13:49.120 --> 00:13:50.960
 before hearing about this fact.

00:13:50.960 --> 00:13:52.080
 - Okay, does that mean you,

00:13:52.080 --> 00:13:53.760
 cause you know what a model is presumably.

00:13:53.760 --> 00:13:54.600
 - I certainly do.

00:13:54.600 --> 00:13:56.880
 - And you know what the Mississippi is.

00:13:56.880 --> 00:14:00.000
 But I'm conceptually incapable of joining those two together.

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:00.920
 (laughing)

00:14:00.920 --> 00:14:02.240
 Is what we've learned.

00:14:02.240 --> 00:14:03.440
 (laughing)

00:14:03.440 --> 00:14:05.880
 - Well, for those of you who are, you know,

00:14:05.880 --> 00:14:08.080
 imaginationally absent at home,

00:14:08.080 --> 00:14:11.640
 it's a model of a river and it's surrounding land.

00:14:11.640 --> 00:14:13.520
 - But a river's made of water.

00:14:13.520 --> 00:14:14.360
 - Yeah.

00:14:14.360 --> 00:14:15.200
 - Yeah.

00:14:15.200 --> 00:14:18.840
 - So for water in the model, they use water.

00:14:18.840 --> 00:14:20.920
 - They also have to model the banks

00:14:20.920 --> 00:14:22.720
 otherwise that's just a puddle on the floor.

00:14:22.720 --> 00:14:23.560
 - Yeah, exactly.

00:14:23.560 --> 00:14:25.000
 Yeah, yeah, I see, okay.

00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:28.480
 - So you've modeled everything surrounding the river,

00:14:28.480 --> 00:14:30.200
 basically, and then just pour water into it.

00:14:30.200 --> 00:14:32.720
 - All like the flood plains and stuff like that, right?

00:14:32.720 --> 00:14:33.560
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:14:33.560 --> 00:14:35.840
 - All the land around it that might be affected by it.

00:14:35.840 --> 00:14:37.160
 - Exactly, yeah, yeah.

00:14:37.160 --> 00:14:38.400
 - Why did we want to muddle it, I guess?

00:14:38.400 --> 00:14:40.240
 - Well, we wanted to figure out how it worked

00:14:40.240 --> 00:14:41.200
 and get to know it better.

00:14:41.200 --> 00:14:43.760
 So this was called the Mississippi River Basin

00:14:43.760 --> 00:14:47.400
 Model Waterways Experiment Station near Clinton, Mississippi.

00:14:47.400 --> 00:14:50.800
 And it was built because the Mississippi was always flooding

00:14:50.800 --> 00:14:53.400
 and actually they just had a couple of really awful floods.

00:14:53.400 --> 00:14:56.520
 So in 1927, there was the worst flood in US history.

00:14:56.520 --> 00:14:58.640
 1937, another bad one.

00:14:58.640 --> 00:15:01.680
 And this guy called Eugene Raybold said,

00:15:01.680 --> 00:15:04.240
 the problem we're having is that whenever there's a flood,

00:15:04.240 --> 00:15:05.360
 we try and fix it,

00:15:05.360 --> 00:15:07.400
 and this is a problem with flooding today still,

00:15:07.400 --> 00:15:09.080
 but we try and fix it in the individual place

00:15:09.080 --> 00:15:12.480
 where there was a flood, so we'll build a levee or a dam.

00:15:12.480 --> 00:15:15.080
 But that's not understanding the river as a whole.

00:15:15.080 --> 00:15:17.000
 And that just has a knock on effect further down.

00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:18.840
 You're just kicking it further down the road.

00:15:18.840 --> 00:15:21.600
 So what we need to do is we need to build the whole river.

00:15:21.600 --> 00:15:24.240
 And he was quite sure on laborers

00:15:24.240 --> 00:15:25.720
 'cause everyone was fighting in the war,

00:15:25.720 --> 00:15:26.560
 for what there were,

00:15:26.560 --> 00:15:29.000
 were quite a lot of German and Italian prisoners of war.

00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:31.400
 And so they all must have been so confused

00:15:31.400 --> 00:15:34.520
 when they were carted to prisoner of war camp in Mississippi

00:15:34.520 --> 00:15:37.040
 and told to build the Mississippi River again.

00:15:37.040 --> 00:15:39.280
 - For those men getting home after the war,

00:15:39.280 --> 00:15:41.320
 after the, oh, Hans, we're so worried.

00:15:41.320 --> 00:15:43.520
 You know, you were kept as a prisoner of war.

00:15:43.520 --> 00:15:44.640
 It must have been awful.

00:15:44.640 --> 00:15:46.000
 What did they make you do?

00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:47.520
 Oh, you know, just really,

00:15:47.520 --> 00:15:48.880
 it was really difficult actually.

00:15:48.880 --> 00:15:50.160
 Yeah, but what were you doing, Hans?

00:15:50.160 --> 00:15:52.280
 Were you maybe picking cotton in the fields

00:15:52.280 --> 00:15:53.680
 or working in a mine?

00:15:53.680 --> 00:15:56.680
 Yeah, I mean, you know, we don't model, model building.

00:15:56.680 --> 00:15:59.200
 - Like that's, it's twice the size of the Vatican.

00:15:59.200 --> 00:16:01.760
 I reckon there was a lot of earth being moved around, right?

00:16:01.760 --> 00:16:02.800
 - Yeah, it's not model building,

00:16:02.800 --> 00:16:04.360
 like a wallhammer fanatic.

00:16:04.360 --> 00:16:05.400
 (all laughing)

00:16:05.400 --> 00:16:08.000
 - It wasn't a ground build, they didn't come to play with it.

00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:09.760
 Basically, that's what they were doing.

00:16:09.760 --> 00:16:12.120
 - It feels to me like I wouldn't personally

00:16:12.120 --> 00:16:14.800
 want to be part of that team, you know?

00:16:14.800 --> 00:16:16.040
 - Given the choice between that

00:16:16.040 --> 00:16:18.080
 and other prisoner of war labor,

00:16:18.080 --> 00:16:20.080
 like absolutely will be on model road.

00:16:20.080 --> 00:16:21.040
 - Team fake river.

00:16:21.040 --> 00:16:22.960
 - Model railway, I've given away my address there.

00:16:22.960 --> 00:16:25.000
 (all laughing)

00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:26.280
 - River modeling duty, yeah.

00:16:26.280 --> 00:16:27.120
 - How big was it, Anna?

00:16:27.120 --> 00:16:27.960
 Sorry, I missed that.

00:16:27.960 --> 00:16:28.800
 - So, I haven't actually said it.

00:16:28.800 --> 00:16:30.920
 I've just said it was about twice the size of the Vatican.

00:16:30.920 --> 00:16:33.000
 - But you know how big the Vatican is.

00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:34.200
 - And you know what twice is.

00:16:34.200 --> 00:16:36.760
 Can you not put those two concepts together?

00:16:36.760 --> 00:16:38.520
 - I can't actually think of how big the Vatican,

00:16:38.520 --> 00:16:41.640
 because the Vatican is a whole city, right?

00:16:41.640 --> 00:16:42.480
 Like it's big.

00:16:42.480 --> 00:16:43.520
 - It's difficult, it's difficult.

00:16:43.520 --> 00:16:45.080
 - But it's not a big city, you know that.

00:16:45.080 --> 00:16:47.160
 - Yeah, but okay, that still doesn't help.

00:16:47.160 --> 00:16:49.280
 - I reckon it's about a square kilometer, is it?

00:16:49.280 --> 00:16:51.680
 - It's, well, I can give you another measure.

00:16:51.680 --> 00:16:54.840
 It was also about the size of 120 football pitches.

00:16:54.840 --> 00:16:56.840
 It was 210 acres.

00:16:56.840 --> 00:16:58.440
 - Can we get it in hedges next time?

00:16:58.440 --> 00:17:01.920
 - Sorry, distance to the moon, it's, God knows.

00:17:01.920 --> 00:17:03.600
 - It's so huge, this thing.

00:17:03.600 --> 00:17:06.520
 The streams in this thing are eight miles long in total.

00:17:06.520 --> 00:17:08.160
 Like it's really big.

00:17:08.160 --> 00:17:09.600
 - Yeah, and the only way you could see it all

00:17:09.600 --> 00:17:12.520
 was from an observation point that was four stories tall,

00:17:12.520 --> 00:17:13.360
 wasn't it?

00:17:13.360 --> 00:17:15.400
 So you had to climb right the way up,

00:17:15.400 --> 00:17:17.120
 and then you could see the whole thing.

00:17:17.120 --> 00:17:17.960
 - Yeah.

00:17:17.960 --> 00:17:20.040
 - One gallon of water in the thing

00:17:20.040 --> 00:17:24.480
 represented 1.5 million gallons of water in the real world.

00:17:24.480 --> 00:17:26.520
 - Very cool. - So cool.

00:17:26.520 --> 00:17:29.640
 - I think five minutes of water running through the basin

00:17:29.640 --> 00:17:33.000
 simulated an entire day of water running through the Mississippi.

00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:34.560
 So you could quite quickly work out.

00:17:34.560 --> 00:17:35.560
 And it was super useful.

00:17:35.560 --> 00:17:37.720
 It was a few years after it was built.

00:17:37.720 --> 00:17:38.920
 There were some signs of flooding.

00:17:38.920 --> 00:17:40.360
 People were getting a bit nervous.

00:17:40.360 --> 00:17:41.800
 Signs of flooding in the Missouri River,

00:17:41.800 --> 00:17:44.240
 which is a tributary of the Mississippi,

00:17:44.240 --> 00:17:45.640
 longest river in the US.

00:17:45.640 --> 00:17:49.320
 And so they simulated what was happening in the little model.

00:17:49.320 --> 00:17:50.400
 And they said, oh, shit, yeah, it's

00:17:50.400 --> 00:17:52.440
 going to flood here and there, not too much there.

00:17:52.440 --> 00:17:53.560
 Build it down there.

00:17:53.560 --> 00:17:55.880
 And they did and saved a few million quid.

00:17:55.880 --> 00:17:57.160
 - That's amazing.

00:17:57.160 --> 00:18:00.440
 I was thinking about the songs, because it's really tied

00:18:00.440 --> 00:18:01.040
 into blues.

00:18:01.040 --> 00:18:04.120
 And it's also a river that comes up a lot in songs.

00:18:04.120 --> 00:18:05.480
 And for me, I love Jeff Buckley.

00:18:05.480 --> 00:18:06.480
 - Like Old Man River.

00:18:06.480 --> 00:18:09.160
 - Like Old Man River, Jeff Buckley drowned in the Mississippi.

00:18:09.160 --> 00:18:09.640
 - Did he?

00:18:09.640 --> 00:18:11.920
 - Yeah, and that, so for me, it's a river

00:18:11.920 --> 00:18:13.880
 that I've always noticed in songs.

00:18:13.880 --> 00:18:16.040
 So I was looking into it, and I found out that actually,

00:18:16.040 --> 00:18:20.000
 the Mississippi River actually had a sign to it,

00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:23.000
 a songwriter and singer called Charlie Maguire.

00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:25.400
 And he was the singing ranger.

00:18:25.400 --> 00:18:26.240
 - What's the job, sorry?

00:18:26.240 --> 00:18:27.440
 - He goes around.

00:18:27.440 --> 00:18:29.800
 - Yeah, he writes songs about the Mississippi.

00:18:29.800 --> 00:18:32.880
 - I better use the word hippie quite a lot.

00:18:32.880 --> 00:18:35.920
 - Dippy, are you going for a Dippy in the Mississippi?

00:18:35.920 --> 00:18:38.560
 It's going to get pretty nippy, get slippy, love.

00:18:38.560 --> 00:18:40.600
 We could do this job, it's pretty easy.

00:18:40.600 --> 00:18:43.320
 - Yeah, no, he wrote a lot of songs at his time.

00:18:43.320 --> 00:18:46.360
 So, and the songs would embody the story of the Mississippi.

00:18:46.360 --> 00:18:48.760
 So one song was called Great Mississippi.

00:18:48.760 --> 00:18:50.560
 That was about where it starts and where it ends.

00:18:50.560 --> 00:18:51.240
 - The route one.

00:18:51.240 --> 00:18:52.200
 - Rock strata.

00:18:52.200 --> 00:18:53.320
 - When was this guy's story?

00:18:53.320 --> 00:18:54.200
 - 2003.

00:18:54.200 --> 00:18:54.880
 - Oh, wow.

00:18:54.880 --> 00:18:56.040
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:18:56.040 --> 00:18:57.600
 The singing ranger is the only person

00:18:57.600 --> 00:18:59.120
 that's ever been given this position.

00:18:59.120 --> 00:19:01.920
 And yeah, he wrote tons of songs, won lots of awards.

00:19:01.920 --> 00:19:03.160
 Not Grammys.

00:19:03.160 --> 00:19:03.920
 - No Grammys.

00:19:03.920 --> 00:19:05.960
 - Was it awards for best song about the Mississippi

00:19:05.960 --> 00:19:09.080
 written by the person employed by the songs about the Mississippi?

00:19:09.080 --> 00:19:10.640
 - I reckon we've got a chance this year

00:19:10.640 --> 00:19:12.120
 with the old nippy song.

00:19:12.120 --> 00:19:15.000
 - I had to completely agree.

00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:16.640
 - Here's a cool thing about the Mississippi.

00:19:16.640 --> 00:19:19.400
 It's a map that was published of the river.

00:19:19.400 --> 00:19:22.240
 And it was published in 1866.

00:19:22.240 --> 00:19:24.960
 And it's called The Ribbon Map of the Father of Waters.

00:19:24.960 --> 00:19:26.240
 And it's a strip map.

00:19:26.240 --> 00:19:30.360
 So the map was 11 feet long, but only three inches wide.

00:19:30.360 --> 00:19:31.200
 - Oh my gosh.

00:19:31.200 --> 00:19:32.040
 - I know.

00:19:32.040 --> 00:19:33.680
 It's really funny.

00:19:33.680 --> 00:19:35.120
 Strip maps used to be really big.

00:19:35.120 --> 00:19:36.520
 So that these just weren't really long.

00:19:36.520 --> 00:19:38.040
 - Really long.

00:19:38.040 --> 00:19:39.680
 If you were planning a specific trip,

00:19:39.680 --> 00:19:41.440
 and this is ages and centuries ago,

00:19:41.440 --> 00:19:43.000
 you might have a strip map.

00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:44.720
 If you were going on a pilgrimage to Jerusalem,

00:19:44.720 --> 00:19:47.160
 'cause it's basically one route.

00:19:47.160 --> 00:19:48.560
 And it says turn left at this town

00:19:48.560 --> 00:19:50.360
 and then go straight along here for another five miles

00:19:50.360 --> 00:19:51.960
 and then turn right at whatever.

00:19:51.960 --> 00:19:54.000
 And it was on a spool, basically.

00:19:54.000 --> 00:19:55.600
 So you just spool along as you went.

00:19:55.600 --> 00:19:58.720
 I think it was more for tourism purposes than for cartography.

00:19:58.720 --> 00:20:00.080
 - I might be wrong about this.

00:20:00.080 --> 00:20:02.640
 I think they used to have like GPS's of those, did they?

00:20:02.640 --> 00:20:03.480
 - Yes, they did.

00:20:03.480 --> 00:20:04.840
 I met the guy who owns loads of them.

00:20:04.840 --> 00:20:06.280
 I borrowed some from him.

00:20:06.280 --> 00:20:08.240
 And you put a wristwatch on exactly like James says,

00:20:08.240 --> 00:20:09.640
 like London to Brighton.

00:20:09.640 --> 00:20:12.200
 You just load in the cartridge for London to Brighton.

00:20:12.200 --> 00:20:14.160
 And then as you're driving along, you just wind on a bit.

00:20:14.160 --> 00:20:15.000
 - So clever. - So clever.

00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:16.000
 - Oh, wow.

00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:17.400
 - Crawly. - That's so cool.

00:20:17.400 --> 00:20:18.640
 (laughing)

00:20:18.640 --> 00:20:19.640
 - Wow.

00:20:19.640 --> 00:20:20.480
 - Yeah, really fun.

00:20:20.480 --> 00:20:22.280
 - What happens if there's a closed road?

00:20:22.280 --> 00:20:23.120
 - You're stuffed.

00:20:23.120 --> 00:20:23.960
 - Yeah, you're stuffed.

00:20:23.960 --> 00:20:25.480
 - You can only go in that.

00:20:25.480 --> 00:20:27.480
 It only tells you that you're on the right route.

00:20:27.480 --> 00:20:28.840
 - Or you need to have several,

00:20:28.840 --> 00:20:30.600
 the whole back of your car is full.

00:20:30.600 --> 00:20:32.600
 It's tiny. - Car refurbification.

00:20:32.600 --> 00:20:33.520
 - Exactly.

00:20:33.520 --> 00:20:34.520
 (laughing)

00:20:34.520 --> 00:20:36.160
 - James Robert Scott.

00:20:36.160 --> 00:20:37.000
 You know him?

00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:37.840
 - No.

00:20:37.840 --> 00:20:40.800
 - He was in West Quincee, Missouri

00:20:40.800 --> 00:20:44.080
 when there was a great flood of the Mississippi in 1993.

00:20:44.080 --> 00:20:46.200
 So there was flooding happening all over the place

00:20:46.200 --> 00:20:48.160
 and they'd put lots of sandbags in

00:20:48.160 --> 00:20:51.360
 and levees or levees or how he pronounced that.

00:20:51.360 --> 00:20:55.360
 Anyway, he decided that he was going to remove

00:20:55.360 --> 00:21:00.000
 some of the sandbags and basically allow an area to flood.

00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:02.720
 And it was very, no one died, but it's very dangerous.

00:21:02.720 --> 00:21:04.880
 And also, you know, lots of people lost land

00:21:04.880 --> 00:21:06.160
 and stuff like that.

00:21:06.160 --> 00:21:09.120
 He claimed that he did it because his town was in trouble

00:21:09.120 --> 00:21:12.520
 and he wanted to move the sandbags from one place to another

00:21:12.520 --> 00:21:16.440
 to try and, you know, keep his town safe.

00:21:16.440 --> 00:21:18.600
 But then apparently he told his friend

00:21:18.600 --> 00:21:19.840
 that he'd actually done it

00:21:19.840 --> 00:21:22.080
 so that he could strand his wife on the other side

00:21:22.080 --> 00:21:25.680
 of the river so that he could have an affair.

00:21:25.680 --> 00:21:26.720
 - So he could have an affair?

00:21:26.720 --> 00:21:27.560
 - Yeah.

00:21:27.560 --> 00:21:29.160
 - How long was he trying to strand her for?

00:21:29.160 --> 00:21:32.040
 - Well, a few weeks, he was hoping that it might happen.

00:21:32.040 --> 00:21:33.320
 Yeah. - Climacy.

00:21:33.320 --> 00:21:35.120
 - He maintains his innocence, I should say.

00:21:35.120 --> 00:21:37.400
 He's in prison, I found him guilty.

00:21:37.400 --> 00:21:39.880
 He's eligible for parole in 2023.

00:21:39.880 --> 00:21:43.600
 - And that's for the sandbag moving, not for the affair?

00:21:43.600 --> 00:21:46.880
 - Yes, I don't think it's illegal to have an affair.

00:21:46.880 --> 00:21:48.440
 - A very puritanical.

00:21:48.440 --> 00:21:51.000
 - No, because all the damage that it caused.

00:21:51.000 --> 00:21:51.840
 - Yeah, of course.

00:21:51.840 --> 00:21:53.960
 - It was billions of dollars of damage.

00:21:53.960 --> 00:21:54.800
 - What?

00:21:54.800 --> 00:21:56.080
 - One figure I read was 15 billion.

00:21:56.080 --> 00:21:57.600
 - How many sandbags did he move?

00:21:57.600 --> 00:21:58.960
 - Well, you only need--

00:21:58.960 --> 00:22:01.280
 - You only need to remove one finger from the dam

00:22:01.280 --> 00:22:03.440
 and then everything goes. - Yeah, that's true.

00:22:03.440 --> 00:22:04.640
 And you've got to be needing those fingers

00:22:04.640 --> 00:22:07.200
 when you're conducting your illicit extramarital affair.

00:22:07.200 --> 00:22:09.120
 (laughing)

00:22:09.120 --> 00:22:11.240
 - There are easier ways to have affairs, aren't there?

00:22:11.240 --> 00:22:12.640
 - It feels like-- - Ken Dark?

00:22:12.640 --> 00:22:13.480
 - Get a hedge.

00:22:13.480 --> 00:22:14.320
 - Why not?

00:22:14.320 --> 00:22:16.560
 (laughing)

00:22:16.560 --> 00:22:19.140
 (upbeat music)

00:22:19.140 --> 00:22:25.800
 - Okay, it is time for fact number three and that is James.

00:22:25.800 --> 00:22:28.560
 - Okay, my fact this week is that one of the few historians

00:22:28.560 --> 00:22:32.240
 to use the term Dark Ages is Professor Ken Dark.

00:22:32.240 --> 00:22:33.960
 (laughing)

00:22:33.960 --> 00:22:34.800
 - It's funny.

00:22:34.800 --> 00:22:36.920
 - It's funny having a professor called Ken.

00:22:36.920 --> 00:22:38.040
 (laughing)

00:22:38.040 --> 00:22:39.240
 - I think that's funny enough.

00:22:39.240 --> 00:22:40.080
 - Why?

00:22:40.080 --> 00:22:41.080
 - What?

00:22:41.080 --> 00:22:42.400
 - My name's Ken Dark.

00:22:42.400 --> 00:22:43.680
 (laughing)

00:22:43.680 --> 00:22:47.160
 - Because Ken in Scots, Old Scots means knowledge,

00:22:47.160 --> 00:22:49.720
 like you're Ken, and so, and he's a professor.

00:22:49.720 --> 00:22:51.400
 So is that why you found funny about that?

00:22:51.400 --> 00:22:52.880
 - God, it does mean knowledge you're right.

00:22:52.880 --> 00:22:54.920
 And it makes me think that Ken of Barbie and Ken

00:22:54.920 --> 00:22:59.040
 has sunk a long way, hasn't he, since the Ken's view.

00:22:59.040 --> 00:23:00.680
 - Are they called the Dark Ages?

00:23:00.680 --> 00:23:01.520
 - After Ken.

00:23:01.520 --> 00:23:02.360
 - After Ken Dark.

00:23:02.360 --> 00:23:03.200
 - Or they're not.

00:23:03.200 --> 00:23:04.640
 - Should've called it the Ken Ages.

00:23:04.640 --> 00:23:05.480
 - This is just--

00:23:05.480 --> 00:23:06.520
 (laughing)

00:23:06.520 --> 00:23:07.360
 - Not Ken Ages.

00:23:07.360 --> 00:23:08.200
 - Ken Ages ago.

00:23:08.200 --> 00:23:10.440
 (laughing)

00:23:10.440 --> 00:23:12.840
 - Very good.

00:23:12.840 --> 00:23:16.480
 This is just a complete coincidence, really, I think.

00:23:16.480 --> 00:23:18.320
 So it's an article that I read on the website

00:23:18.320 --> 00:23:20.280
 of the University of Sheffield,

00:23:20.280 --> 00:23:22.440
 and it's about English heritage.

00:23:22.440 --> 00:23:26.600
 So they decided to do a handbook and some websites,

00:23:26.600 --> 00:23:28.640
 stuff like that, where they called the period

00:23:28.640 --> 00:23:32.440
 between 400 AD and 1066, the Dark Ages.

00:23:32.440 --> 00:23:34.960
 And then there was a huge sort of campaign

00:23:34.960 --> 00:23:37.520
 of a lot of Twitter historians saying,

00:23:37.520 --> 00:23:39.560
 and other historians, but saying,

00:23:39.560 --> 00:23:41.320
 you can't call it the Dark Ages.

00:23:41.320 --> 00:23:44.680
 What it does is it makes people think it's a terrible time

00:23:44.680 --> 00:23:47.680
 where people had an awful life and stuff like that.

00:23:47.680 --> 00:23:51.000
 And it was, that's not really what Dark Ages means,

00:23:51.000 --> 00:23:53.240
 but anyway, English heritage said that the reason

00:23:53.240 --> 00:23:55.240
 that we're calling it that is because there is

00:23:55.240 --> 00:23:57.480
 this professor called Professor Ken Dark,

00:23:57.480 --> 00:23:59.000
 and he calls it the Dark Ages.

00:23:59.000 --> 00:24:01.400
 He's a proper professor, so we should be able

00:24:01.400 --> 00:24:03.200
 to call it that as well.

00:24:03.200 --> 00:24:06.120
 A lot of people pointed out that the article

00:24:06.120 --> 00:24:09.520
 that Ken Dark wrote was slightly esoteric.

00:24:09.520 --> 00:24:11.800
 It was about the Byzantine era.

00:24:11.800 --> 00:24:13.720
 It wasn't about the British Dark Ages,

00:24:13.720 --> 00:24:15.440
 early modern period.

00:24:15.440 --> 00:24:16.880
 If you look at Ken Dark's work,

00:24:16.880 --> 00:24:19.320
 which I have done quite a lot,

00:24:19.320 --> 00:24:21.840
 you'll find that he's done something recently

00:24:21.840 --> 00:24:24.320
 where he talks about illuminating the Dark Ages

00:24:24.320 --> 00:24:26.300
 and trying to bring light into the Dark Ages.

00:24:26.300 --> 00:24:29.080
 And he's not calling them the Dark Ages

00:24:29.080 --> 00:24:30.400
 'cause his name is Ken Dark.

00:24:30.400 --> 00:24:31.520
 I just wanna make that really true.

00:24:31.520 --> 00:24:32.960
 - That's what you want do you think?

00:24:32.960 --> 00:24:34.280
 (laughing)

00:24:34.280 --> 00:24:36.520
 - There's an argument that they basically just

00:24:36.520 --> 00:24:38.920
 wanted to kind of shut down the argument

00:24:38.920 --> 00:24:42.480
 and say, "Here's some evidence, this is why we did it."

00:24:42.480 --> 00:24:44.360
 - And yet, if you asked any of those historians,

00:24:44.360 --> 00:24:48.800
 would you like to go and live in 430 AD forever?

00:24:48.800 --> 00:24:51.720
 You can't come back, it's not a cool history trip.

00:24:51.720 --> 00:24:53.600
 - Well, you can take your family.

00:24:53.600 --> 00:24:55.240
 - You can take your family.

00:24:55.240 --> 00:24:56.700
 - Well, for instance, there's one historian

00:24:56.700 --> 00:24:57.980
 called Charles West who said,

00:24:57.980 --> 00:25:00.820
 "If the term Dark Ages really must be used,

00:25:00.820 --> 00:25:03.100
 it should at least be reserved for periods

00:25:03.100 --> 00:25:05.540
 of true in-humanity and barbarity,

00:25:05.540 --> 00:25:07.260
 such as the 20th century."

00:25:07.260 --> 00:25:09.620
 - Oh, wow. - Oh, wow.

00:25:09.620 --> 00:25:11.660
 - I do think we've got very snowflakey

00:25:11.660 --> 00:25:12.720
 about the Dark Ages.

00:25:12.720 --> 00:25:14.940
 Come on, it's the one group of people

00:25:14.940 --> 00:25:18.100
 that we can still offend and they can never complain.

00:25:18.100 --> 00:25:20.180
 All right, it's people in history.

00:25:20.180 --> 00:25:22.140
 They can't do anything about it.

00:25:22.140 --> 00:25:23.580
 Just let's call them all ignorant.

00:25:23.580 --> 00:25:24.940
 Who cares, they're not coming back.

00:25:24.940 --> 00:25:27.620
 - Well, I think the point is that the word dark

00:25:27.620 --> 00:25:29.280
 is not supposed to be ignorant, right?

00:25:29.280 --> 00:25:31.120
 It's not supposed to be barbarian.

00:25:31.120 --> 00:25:33.100
 It's supposed to be a time

00:25:33.100 --> 00:25:36.020
 where we did not have much information about it.

00:25:36.020 --> 00:25:37.520
 And that's what it was originally,

00:25:37.520 --> 00:25:40.800
 but people have in the past like popular historians

00:25:40.800 --> 00:25:43.480
 of kind of in the 70s and 80s have said

00:25:43.480 --> 00:25:46.900
 that the Dark Ages was a time of darkness and difficulty.

00:25:46.900 --> 00:25:49.200
 - But I think they have, it has also been used

00:25:49.200 --> 00:25:52.920
 since the concept kind of arose of the Dark Ages

00:25:52.920 --> 00:25:54.240
 to be denigrating.

00:25:54.240 --> 00:25:56.300
 And there has always been this idea

00:25:56.300 --> 00:25:59.360
 that it's also very uncultured time.

00:25:59.360 --> 00:26:00.940
 - After the Romans.

00:26:00.940 --> 00:26:03.100
 - After the Romans, before the Renaissance.

00:26:03.100 --> 00:26:04.340
 - Before the Normans.

00:26:04.340 --> 00:26:06.400
 - They were doing bugger all then.

00:26:06.400 --> 00:26:08.700
 - It was Francesco Petraca, right?

00:26:08.700 --> 00:26:10.200
 - Petraca, yeah.

00:26:10.200 --> 00:26:11.040
 - Yeah, sorry.

00:26:11.040 --> 00:26:12.900
 - No, you're just giving him his proper fancy name.

00:26:12.900 --> 00:26:14.220
 - His proper fancy name, yeah.

00:26:14.220 --> 00:26:15.060
 - Petraca.

00:26:15.060 --> 00:26:16.400
 - And yeah, basically complaining

00:26:16.400 --> 00:26:17.520
 that there were no good books to read,

00:26:17.520 --> 00:26:18.480
 which I find amazing.

00:26:18.480 --> 00:26:19.800
 'Cause then it did as you say, it evolved.

00:26:19.800 --> 00:26:21.840
 - Petraca was just a guy, right?

00:26:21.840 --> 00:26:22.680
 - Yeah, just a guy.

00:26:22.680 --> 00:26:23.520
 (laughing)

00:26:23.520 --> 00:26:24.920
 - No, he's an Italian scholar.

00:26:24.920 --> 00:26:27.120
 I mean, he was big in the 14th century.

00:26:27.120 --> 00:26:28.320
 - Great poet.

00:26:28.320 --> 00:26:29.800
 - Yeah, I haven't read it, but.

00:26:29.800 --> 00:26:31.160
 - He wrote more than one.

00:26:31.160 --> 00:26:32.000
 - Get out.

00:26:32.000 --> 00:26:34.280
 - He was the official poet of the timer.

00:26:34.280 --> 00:26:36.520
 (laughing)

00:26:36.520 --> 00:26:39.760
 - But it does, as you say, sort of mean like,

00:26:39.760 --> 00:26:41.880
 it was when science was being brushed away

00:26:41.880 --> 00:26:43.080
 and religion was coming in.

00:26:43.080 --> 00:26:43.920
 - Yeah.

00:26:43.920 --> 00:26:46.840
 - And as a result, it was a Dark Age for the mind.

00:26:46.840 --> 00:26:47.800
 - Yeah. - Yeah.

00:26:47.800 --> 00:26:49.240
 - As well as there being no records.

00:26:49.240 --> 00:26:50.880
 That's, it's been, yeah.

00:26:50.880 --> 00:26:52.560
 - And let's be honest.

00:26:52.560 --> 00:26:54.720
 - I'm full records of what was going on.

00:26:54.720 --> 00:26:55.560
 - Exactly, I know.

00:26:55.560 --> 00:26:57.160
 - Between 400 and 1056. - I completely agree.

00:26:57.160 --> 00:26:58.000
 I agree with you.

00:26:58.000 --> 00:27:00.400
 - There were other names given to the,

00:27:00.400 --> 00:27:01.240
 what are we calling them?

00:27:01.240 --> 00:27:02.840
 - Early Middle Ages. - Early Middle Ages, yeah.

00:27:02.840 --> 00:27:04.920
 - That were published in various books.

00:27:04.920 --> 00:27:07.280
 So they included the Barbarous Ages,

00:27:07.280 --> 00:27:09.320
 sounds pretty, you know.

00:27:09.320 --> 00:27:11.280
 The Obscure Ages, which I quite like.

00:27:11.280 --> 00:27:12.360
 (laughing)

00:27:12.360 --> 00:27:13.400
 Makes me sound quite cool.

00:27:13.400 --> 00:27:16.600
 The Monkish Ages, absolutely no argument with that.

00:27:16.600 --> 00:27:18.720
 The Muddy Ages, those were all various.

00:27:18.720 --> 00:27:19.560
 - Really?

00:27:19.560 --> 00:27:21.760
 - And then the Mississippi is known as the Old Muddy,

00:27:21.760 --> 00:27:22.600
 isn't it?

00:27:22.600 --> 00:27:23.440
 - Is it? - I think.

00:27:23.440 --> 00:27:24.280
 - Yeah.

00:27:24.280 --> 00:27:25.120
 - This would have been, yeah.

00:27:25.120 --> 00:27:26.400
 - Or the Big Muddy, I think maybe.

00:27:26.400 --> 00:27:27.320
 - The Big Muddy.

00:27:27.320 --> 00:27:28.800
 - No relation to the Muddy Ages.

00:27:28.800 --> 00:27:29.640
 (laughing)

00:27:29.640 --> 00:27:30.880
 - I don't think so.

00:27:30.880 --> 00:27:34.960
 - Also the Dark Ages could be used to describe the period

00:27:34.960 --> 00:27:38.760
 from 1100 BC to 750 BC,

00:27:38.760 --> 00:27:40.960
 which was between the collapse of the Bronze Age

00:27:40.960 --> 00:27:42.240
 civilization in Greece

00:27:42.240 --> 00:27:44.680
 and the beginning of the Archaic Age in Greece.

00:27:44.680 --> 00:27:46.400
 - Oh yeah, the Greek Dark Ages.

00:27:46.400 --> 00:27:48.920
 - Or it could be from the start of the universe

00:27:48.920 --> 00:27:51.080
 until 13.2 billion years ago,

00:27:51.080 --> 00:27:52.960
 which was between the start of the universe

00:27:52.960 --> 00:27:54.360
 and the creation of the first stars.

00:27:54.360 --> 00:27:56.320
 That's called the Dark Ages as well, so.

00:27:56.320 --> 00:27:57.920
 - Oh, but people get offended, don't they?

00:27:57.920 --> 00:28:00.160
 Those little lumps of dust in the air.

00:28:00.160 --> 00:28:02.520
 Get offended now, if we call them the Dark Ages.

00:28:02.520 --> 00:28:04.800
 - I just don't see that the little bits of dust

00:28:04.800 --> 00:28:06.720
 in the air are gonna be able to come back

00:28:06.720 --> 00:28:07.960
 and get offended.

00:28:07.960 --> 00:28:08.800
 I just don't see it.

00:28:08.800 --> 00:28:11.040
 - You guys are not taking into the account

00:28:11.040 --> 00:28:14.320
 that time travel will happen one day.

00:28:14.320 --> 00:28:15.400
 - And that bit for a bit of dust

00:28:15.400 --> 00:28:16.520
 will jump down my throats.

00:28:16.520 --> 00:28:17.680
 - Exactly.

00:28:17.680 --> 00:28:20.400
 I read in one book, this is a book called "Europa History",

00:28:20.400 --> 00:28:22.840
 that the Middle Ages originally meant the time

00:28:22.840 --> 00:28:24.720
 between the first coming of Jesus

00:28:24.720 --> 00:28:26.560
 and the second coming of Jesus.

00:28:26.560 --> 00:28:28.840
 And since the second coming hasn't as far as we know

00:28:28.840 --> 00:28:31.720
 happened, we're still technically in the Middle Ages now.

00:28:31.720 --> 00:28:32.680
 - That's very exciting.

00:28:32.680 --> 00:28:33.520
 - That's cool.

00:28:33.520 --> 00:28:35.520
 - Yeah, and thank God, 'cause I always get really anxious

00:28:35.520 --> 00:28:36.680
 that we're in the modern time

00:28:36.680 --> 00:28:38.240
 and there's nowhere to go after modern.

00:28:38.240 --> 00:28:40.160
 So that's good to know that we're actually still in the middle.

00:28:40.160 --> 00:28:42.120
 - So if anyone says that I'm middle-aged,

00:28:42.120 --> 00:28:44.240
 I could say yes, well, technically I'm middle-aged

00:28:44.240 --> 00:28:46.040
 because the second coming of Christ hasn't happened.

00:28:46.040 --> 00:28:46.880
 - But so are you.

00:28:46.880 --> 00:28:47.840
 (laughing)

00:28:47.840 --> 00:28:48.920
 - We're all like, yeah.

00:28:48.920 --> 00:28:50.560
 - One thing that the Dark Ages,

00:28:50.560 --> 00:28:52.480
 doing the finger quotes there, gave us,

00:28:52.480 --> 00:28:54.840
 which is quite exciting just in reference to literature,

00:28:54.840 --> 00:28:58.240
 was spaces in between words.

00:28:58.240 --> 00:29:01.320
 So every word, as we know, back in old literature,

00:29:01.320 --> 00:29:03.600
 used to be bunged together, no spaces,

00:29:03.600 --> 00:29:05.360
 really hard to tell what's the next word.

00:29:05.360 --> 00:29:06.880
 And it was in that period.

00:29:06.880 --> 00:29:09.480
 The monks started going, let's put a little,

00:29:09.480 --> 00:29:11.040
 we'll put a space in between those two words,

00:29:11.040 --> 00:29:11.880
 what do you reckon?

00:29:11.880 --> 00:29:13.280
 - So they didn't write books of their own,

00:29:13.280 --> 00:29:14.960
 but they did at least introduce some spaces

00:29:14.960 --> 00:29:16.320
 into the books that already existed.

00:29:16.320 --> 00:29:18.160
 - Yeah, it's funny 'cause these days,

00:29:18.160 --> 00:29:19.720
 you know, books have word counts, don't they?

00:29:19.720 --> 00:29:21.800
 You're like, oh, this book is 100,000 words.

00:29:21.800 --> 00:29:22.880
 Whereas I guess in those days,

00:29:22.880 --> 00:29:24.080
 we're like, how long is your manuscript?

00:29:24.080 --> 00:29:26.360
 Well, it's one word, like all the other,

00:29:26.360 --> 00:29:27.640
 all the other books.

00:29:27.640 --> 00:29:32.520
 Yeah, what a word, one very specific word.

00:29:32.520 --> 00:29:35.280
 - So word with you, oh, God, here we go.

00:29:35.280 --> 00:29:39.040
 - The Greek Dark Ages, I love the Greek Dark Ages.

00:29:39.040 --> 00:29:40.040
 - Are they called the Greek Ages,

00:29:40.040 --> 00:29:42.040
 is that contentious as well?

00:29:42.040 --> 00:29:43.120
 - Oh, probably.

00:29:43.120 --> 00:29:44.840
 - Who gives us stuff?

00:29:44.840 --> 00:29:47.840
 I'm signing up with T-Matter on this one, I've got it.

00:29:47.840 --> 00:29:49.840
 - Oh God, I feel like I'm in bad company now.

00:29:49.840 --> 00:29:52.720
 So they're such a mystery.

00:29:52.720 --> 00:29:54.440
 They are, as James was saying,

00:29:54.440 --> 00:29:56.880
 this period at the end of the Bronze Age.

00:29:56.880 --> 00:29:59.320
 And, but they, what I always loved about them

00:29:59.320 --> 00:30:01.640
 is that they happened because of the invasion

00:30:01.640 --> 00:30:04.600
 of the sea peoples, do you know about this?

00:30:04.600 --> 00:30:08.280
 And you will love the sea peoples down there, so great.

00:30:08.280 --> 00:30:10.960
 I actually can't believe that we haven't discussed them before.

00:30:10.960 --> 00:30:14.320
 - This is the class eight talk that I listened to.

00:30:14.320 --> 00:30:15.560
 - There we go.

00:30:15.560 --> 00:30:17.600
 - Basically, they're a group of people.

00:30:17.600 --> 00:30:18.680
 We don't know if they existed,

00:30:18.680 --> 00:30:19.960
 but they're currently historians,

00:30:19.960 --> 00:30:23.560
 best explanation for why in, what was it, 1100 BC.

00:30:23.560 --> 00:30:24.880
 Civilization just collapsed.

00:30:24.880 --> 00:30:28.240
 So we had this amazing, like big palace based states,

00:30:28.240 --> 00:30:29.880
 Mycenaeque empire.

00:30:29.880 --> 00:30:32.600
 - Minoans, they ever? - Exactly.

00:30:32.600 --> 00:30:34.440
 And then it all just vanished.

00:30:34.440 --> 00:30:37.800
 And also ancient Egypt as well, vanished overnight

00:30:37.800 --> 00:30:40.400
 and didn't come back until the Greeks worked out

00:30:40.400 --> 00:30:42.840
 to write an alphabet and stuff 400 years later,

00:30:42.840 --> 00:30:44.200
 got back on their feet.

00:30:44.200 --> 00:30:46.160
 And historians think it's 'cause there was someone

00:30:46.160 --> 00:30:49.040
 called the sea peoples waltzing around the Mediterranean,

00:30:49.040 --> 00:30:51.480
 strange beings who weren't invaded.

00:30:51.480 --> 00:30:52.520
 - Go on.

00:30:52.520 --> 00:30:55.440
 - So, okay, are they, were they of the sea

00:30:55.440 --> 00:30:57.280
 or were they just living on boats?

00:30:57.280 --> 00:30:58.920
 - Well, it's not.

00:30:58.920 --> 00:31:00.320
 - I mean, were they made of water?

00:31:00.320 --> 00:31:02.800
 - Sorry, what is the difference in your mind, Dan,

00:31:02.800 --> 00:31:04.840
 between being of the sea and living on a boat?

00:31:04.840 --> 00:31:08.800
 - Were they like Aquaman or were they a pirate on a boat?

00:31:08.800 --> 00:31:10.840
 - The more serious historians, I think,

00:31:10.840 --> 00:31:14.520
 is count the Merman, Merman-made explanation of sea peoples

00:31:14.520 --> 00:31:15.960
 and say they're probably just boating.

00:31:15.960 --> 00:31:17.640
 - What does Ken Dark say about that?

00:31:17.640 --> 00:31:19.200
 That's what I want to know.

00:31:19.200 --> 00:31:22.760
 - They obviously, the Dark Ages,

00:31:22.760 --> 00:31:25.600
 that aren't called the Dark Ages, were whole of Europe.

00:31:25.600 --> 00:31:28.040
 And it was partly this whole mini kingdoms thing,

00:31:28.040 --> 00:31:31.040
 everyone and his dog can be a king that defined them

00:31:31.040 --> 00:31:34.640
 because it was all so splintered and it was the Goths

00:31:34.640 --> 00:31:36.000
 and the Visigoths and the Ostrogoths

00:31:36.000 --> 00:31:38.760
 and the Norogoths and the Demigoths and stuff,

00:31:38.760 --> 00:31:40.160
 who were all fighting each other,

00:31:40.160 --> 00:31:42.160
 weren't they, for hundreds of years?

00:31:42.160 --> 00:31:44.040
 And the Vandals and the Allons,

00:31:44.040 --> 00:31:45.800
 which I think we've mentioned before.

00:31:45.800 --> 00:31:47.960
 The Allons tribe, who I didn't realize,

00:31:47.960 --> 00:31:49.560
 brought us Great Danes.

00:31:49.560 --> 00:31:51.600
 So that's something else the Dark Ages gave us.

00:31:51.600 --> 00:31:54.360
 The Allons, who were Iranian, were known for their--

00:31:54.360 --> 00:31:56.280
 - Well, it said the Great Danes aren't Danish.

00:31:56.280 --> 00:31:58.920
 - I think they must have taken root via Denmark

00:31:58.920 --> 00:32:00.240
 before they got there.

00:32:00.240 --> 00:32:01.760
 Before they evolved into what they are today.

00:32:01.760 --> 00:32:05.320
 They brought the fighting dogs that led to Great Danes.

00:32:05.320 --> 00:32:08.280
 But then the person who saw, I would say,

00:32:08.280 --> 00:32:11.400
 who kind of presaged the end of this non-Dark Ages,

00:32:11.400 --> 00:32:14.960
 Dark Ages, was probably Charlemagne, do we think?

00:32:14.960 --> 00:32:16.920
 As in he just unified Europe.

00:32:16.920 --> 00:32:18.840
 So he did that, it was a big deal.

00:32:18.840 --> 00:32:21.320
 And you know how he was crowned emperor?

00:32:21.320 --> 00:32:23.040
 - How, like, the ceremony or how we can't be--

00:32:23.040 --> 00:32:24.240
 - Yeah, yeah, the ceremony.

00:32:24.240 --> 00:32:26.600
 - No, oh, is he one of those strange people

00:32:26.600 --> 00:32:27.880
 who crowned themself?

00:32:27.880 --> 00:32:30.360
 - No, quite the opposite, apparently.

00:32:30.360 --> 00:32:32.160
 - It was crowned by someone else.

00:32:32.160 --> 00:32:34.600
 - There you go, at the end.

00:32:34.600 --> 00:32:37.360
 And in fact, he was crowned again as to his will,

00:32:37.360 --> 00:32:38.600
 according to the court scribe,

00:32:38.600 --> 00:32:40.280
 who might have been trying to make him sound really humble.

00:32:40.280 --> 00:32:41.240
 - So he was running away

00:32:41.240 --> 00:32:43.240
 while someone was chasing him with a crown.

00:32:43.240 --> 00:32:44.640
 - Exactly.

00:32:44.640 --> 00:32:48.360
 800 AD, Christmas Day, he'd gone to Rome,

00:32:48.360 --> 00:32:50.800
 and the Pope decided he's gonna crown him emperor

00:32:50.800 --> 00:32:53.360
 of this whole bunch of Western Europe.

00:32:53.360 --> 00:32:55.160
 And he sneaks up behind Charlemagne

00:32:55.160 --> 00:32:56.640
 while Charlemagne's praying

00:32:56.640 --> 00:32:58.440
 and pops a crown on his head.

00:32:58.440 --> 00:32:59.960
 And apparently Charlemagne just stood up and went,

00:32:59.960 --> 00:33:02.480
 "Oh my gosh, no, what, me?"

00:33:02.480 --> 00:33:05.200
 I couldn't, I couldn't possibly.

00:33:05.200 --> 00:33:06.560
 And then he became, you know, the greatest--

00:33:06.560 --> 00:33:07.720
 - It's a good story, isn't it?

00:33:07.720 --> 00:33:08.560
 - It's a good story.

00:33:08.560 --> 00:33:09.880
 - 'Cause like one of them's praying,

00:33:09.880 --> 00:33:12.520
 so he's holy, and he didn't really want it.

00:33:12.520 --> 00:33:13.520
 Well, actually probably happened.

00:33:13.520 --> 00:33:15.840
 They both got really pissed one night.

00:33:15.840 --> 00:33:16.840
 - Was it Charlemagne

00:33:16.840 --> 00:33:19.480
 who supposedly had the asbestos tablecloth?

00:33:19.480 --> 00:33:20.800
 - Oh yeah, that is him.

00:33:20.800 --> 00:33:21.960
 Yeah, yeah, I think so.

00:33:21.960 --> 00:33:24.360
 - That was sort of like his dinner party trick, wasn't it?

00:33:24.360 --> 00:33:25.880
 He would--

00:33:25.880 --> 00:33:27.320
 - He would throw it into a fire

00:33:27.320 --> 00:33:28.720
 so you wouldn't have to clean it

00:33:28.720 --> 00:33:30.360
 because asbestos doesn't burn.

00:33:30.360 --> 00:33:31.600
 So you put it in the fire,

00:33:31.600 --> 00:33:33.280
 it would kind of sterilize,

00:33:33.280 --> 00:33:34.120
 and then you pull it out again

00:33:34.120 --> 00:33:35.760
 and you could use it again.

00:33:35.760 --> 00:33:38.160
 - This was, of course, before they knew about mesothelioma,

00:33:38.160 --> 00:33:39.080
 the terrible lung disease

00:33:39.080 --> 00:33:40.640
 that they presumably all got back then.

00:33:40.640 --> 00:33:44.360
 - I think you only get that from little shards of asbestos.

00:33:44.360 --> 00:33:46.080
 If you have a full tablecloth, you'll be fine.

00:33:46.080 --> 00:33:46.920
 - You're all right.

00:33:46.920 --> 00:33:49.280
 - But if bits come off it, then you would help them.

00:33:49.280 --> 00:33:51.160
 I mean, I'm sure no one was living long enough

00:33:51.160 --> 00:33:53.440
 to worry about the long-term effects

00:33:53.440 --> 00:33:54.520
 of an asbestos table,

00:33:54.520 --> 00:33:57.800
 like there were more pressing health concerns than the age.

00:33:57.800 --> 00:33:59.800
 So they cleared the table.

00:33:59.800 --> 00:34:00.640
 - I don't know if, yes,

00:34:00.640 --> 00:34:01.600
 I don't know if he did that trick

00:34:01.600 --> 00:34:02.960
 where everything stayed underneath,

00:34:02.960 --> 00:34:05.040
 but even a kind of swipe.

00:34:05.040 --> 00:34:06.440
 - You haven't done that trick, by the way.

00:34:06.440 --> 00:34:07.440
 - No, I've tried it once.

00:34:07.440 --> 00:34:08.280
 - It's hard.

00:34:08.280 --> 00:34:09.600
 It is harder than you think.

00:34:09.600 --> 00:34:10.600
 - It does actually work.

00:34:10.600 --> 00:34:11.960
 - I think I've seen you do it.

00:34:11.960 --> 00:34:13.720
 - Yeah, well, I used to be a waiter

00:34:13.720 --> 00:34:15.480
 and I used to try it a lot.

00:34:15.480 --> 00:34:17.600
 And like most of the time you can't really do it.

00:34:17.600 --> 00:34:19.400
 And so there's a trick to it, but yeah.

00:34:19.400 --> 00:34:20.480
 - You were the most fired waiter

00:34:20.480 --> 00:34:22.280
 in the North of England, though, I love you.

00:34:22.280 --> 00:34:23.520
 (laughing)

00:34:23.520 --> 00:34:26.100
 (upbeat music)

00:34:26.100 --> 00:34:30.680
 - Okay, it is time for our final fact of the show.

00:34:30.680 --> 00:34:31.980
 And that is my fact.

00:34:31.980 --> 00:34:34.720
 My fact this week is that the metal used

00:34:34.720 --> 00:34:39.200
 to make Grammy Award trophies is called Grammium.

00:34:39.200 --> 00:34:40.040
 (laughing)

00:34:40.040 --> 00:34:40.860
 - Amazing.

00:34:40.860 --> 00:34:41.700
 - What a coincidence.

00:34:41.700 --> 00:34:42.720
 (laughing)

00:34:42.720 --> 00:34:46.440
 - Well, this is a trademarked metal alloy, a zinc alloy,

00:34:46.440 --> 00:34:49.800
 that a guy called John Billings has patented.

00:34:49.800 --> 00:34:53.000
 And he is the guy who makes the Grammy Awards.

00:34:53.000 --> 00:34:55.280
 And he's made them for decades now.

00:34:55.280 --> 00:34:58.880
 And what I didn't realize was it's a little team

00:34:58.880 --> 00:35:01.560
 that assembles every year the Grammys.

00:35:01.560 --> 00:35:05.160
 And it's basically a one shop operation

00:35:05.160 --> 00:35:07.760
 where not only do they make these Grammys,

00:35:07.760 --> 00:35:09.480
 but then they put them in a van

00:35:09.480 --> 00:35:12.680
 and they drive 2,000 or something miles across the country

00:35:12.680 --> 00:35:14.920
 to deliver it personally.

00:35:14.920 --> 00:35:16.840
 John Billings himself would be sitting

00:35:16.840 --> 00:35:18.080
 in the car doing this.

00:35:18.080 --> 00:35:20.720
 And he is the Grammy man.

00:35:20.720 --> 00:35:22.040
 And it's-

00:35:22.040 --> 00:35:24.440
 - They use a strip map to get there.

00:35:24.440 --> 00:35:25.760
 So exciting.

00:35:25.760 --> 00:35:27.360
 One year they went off course, it was a disaster,

00:35:27.360 --> 00:35:28.560
 there were no Grammys.

00:35:29.440 --> 00:35:30.600
 - Yeah. And it's, yeah.

00:35:30.600 --> 00:35:33.440
 So this guy, he joined when he was quite young.

00:35:33.440 --> 00:35:35.540
 There was a previous person making the Grammys.

00:35:35.540 --> 00:35:36.740
 And since he took over,

00:35:36.740 --> 00:35:39.040
 he changed the design of the Grammys,

00:35:39.040 --> 00:35:40.360
 which is what they are today.

00:35:40.360 --> 00:35:44.960
 And he also came up with this new, stronger alloy

00:35:44.960 --> 00:35:46.640
 because all of the other previous Grammys

00:35:46.640 --> 00:35:48.320
 were quite flimsy and would break.

00:35:48.320 --> 00:35:50.120
 And he thought this needs to be, you know-

00:35:50.120 --> 00:35:51.080
 - Did they actually break?

00:35:51.080 --> 00:35:52.280
 Did people take Grammys home

00:35:52.280 --> 00:35:54.160
 and then you put them down and it just comes?

00:35:54.160 --> 00:35:55.000
 - They still do, yeah.

00:35:55.000 --> 00:35:55.840
 - They still break.

00:35:55.840 --> 00:35:56.680
 - But they broke a lot more easy.

00:35:56.680 --> 00:35:58.200
 I think it was so the Grammys,

00:35:58.200 --> 00:35:59.960
 if you don't know what they are,

00:35:59.960 --> 00:36:03.120
 it is a Grammophone that is the shape of the trophy.

00:36:03.120 --> 00:36:03.960
 And so obviously-

00:36:03.960 --> 00:36:06.440
 - And I suppose it's a music award in America as the other.

00:36:06.440 --> 00:36:07.280
 - Yeah, yeah.

00:36:07.280 --> 00:36:09.000
 It's the biggest music award in America.

00:36:09.000 --> 00:36:12.800
 And the trophy is in the shape of a Grammophone.

00:36:12.800 --> 00:36:15.440
 And it was particularly the arm that was with the stylus

00:36:15.440 --> 00:36:16.960
 on the end that was particularly flimsy.

00:36:16.960 --> 00:36:19.400
 And that was the bit when he redesigned it

00:36:19.400 --> 00:36:20.920
 that he wanted to get stronger.

00:36:20.920 --> 00:36:24.720
 - Adele, the singer once snapped part of her Grammy on stage.

00:36:24.720 --> 00:36:27.240
 She dropped it on stage and broke part of it off.

00:36:27.240 --> 00:36:31.200
 And in 2010, Taylor Swift was carrying four Grammys

00:36:31.200 --> 00:36:34.440
 and she dropped one of them and it broke into pieces.

00:36:34.440 --> 00:36:37.080
 And what happens is when it breaks into pieces,

00:36:37.080 --> 00:36:39.840
 you send it back and they fix it for you.

00:36:39.840 --> 00:36:41.920
 Mr. Billings fix it for you.

00:36:41.920 --> 00:36:44.920
 But she wrote oops on the side of the one she broke

00:36:44.920 --> 00:36:48.280
 and he now has that in his office on the side,

00:36:48.280 --> 00:36:51.320
 a Taylor Swift broken Grammy and he gave her a new one.

00:36:51.320 --> 00:36:52.280
 - That's great.

00:36:52.280 --> 00:36:55.280
 I wonder if she broke the, so the Grammys that we see-

00:36:55.280 --> 00:36:56.120
 - The stunt.

00:36:56.120 --> 00:36:57.600
 - There are stunt Grammys.

00:36:57.600 --> 00:36:59.800
 - And that's what he drives across the country as well.

00:36:59.800 --> 00:37:01.840
 He drives the stunt ones across the country.

00:37:01.840 --> 00:37:04.000
 That drives them back as well before and after each.

00:37:04.000 --> 00:37:05.280
 - Sorry, what is a stunt Grammy?

00:37:05.280 --> 00:37:06.120
 - A stunt Grammy is the one-

00:37:06.120 --> 00:37:07.360
 - It's one that can do amazing tricks.

00:37:07.360 --> 00:37:10.400
 So it throws us other skyscrapers, tightrope walks.

00:37:10.400 --> 00:37:12.720
 - So the idea is that the real Grammys

00:37:12.720 --> 00:37:14.800
 are going to be given to everyone who's won them,

00:37:14.800 --> 00:37:17.240
 need to have their name put on it and so on.

00:37:17.240 --> 00:37:18.520
 And they can't do that on the night.

00:37:18.520 --> 00:37:21.880
 So he drives the fake Grammys that you see them holding

00:37:21.880 --> 00:37:23.880
 at the award ceremony and then they give them back

00:37:23.880 --> 00:37:25.480
 and then the real Grammy.

00:37:25.480 --> 00:37:27.040
 - So those are not real Grammys?

00:37:27.040 --> 00:37:27.880
 - Well, they're obviously-

00:37:27.880 --> 00:37:30.120
 - Well, they used every single year.

00:37:30.120 --> 00:37:31.880
 The same ones are used every year.

00:37:31.880 --> 00:37:33.920
 So if you get a Grammy next year, Andy,

00:37:33.920 --> 00:37:35.320
 which I'm sure you're hoping for.

00:37:35.320 --> 00:37:37.160
 - I'm trying.

00:37:37.160 --> 00:37:39.760
 - You will get one that might have been had by Adele

00:37:39.760 --> 00:37:42.320
 a few years ago or by Taylor Swift or whatever.

00:37:42.320 --> 00:37:44.480
 'Cause when he gets the stunt Grammys home,

00:37:44.480 --> 00:37:46.320
 he cleans them with washing up liquid

00:37:46.320 --> 00:37:48.640
 to get rid of any fingerprints or anything like that.

00:37:48.640 --> 00:37:50.360
 And then just puts them into storage.

00:37:50.360 --> 00:37:52.560
 And then the next year he takes them back.

00:37:52.560 --> 00:37:53.800
 - Nice.

00:37:53.800 --> 00:37:56.720
 - So he just, every year drives a load of Grammys

00:37:56.720 --> 00:37:58.320
 across America then drives them back the other way?

00:37:58.320 --> 00:38:00.560
 - Yeah, you would think he would have a storage unit

00:38:00.560 --> 00:38:01.680
 where he could just leave them.

00:38:01.680 --> 00:38:03.080
 - Does seem like that would be sensible.

00:38:03.080 --> 00:38:04.160
 - It would be in the fishin', wouldn't it?

00:38:04.160 --> 00:38:05.440
 - Yeah.

00:38:05.440 --> 00:38:08.080
 - And then what does he do with the actual one?

00:38:08.080 --> 00:38:10.440
 Sorry, does he then post them out first class?

00:38:10.440 --> 00:38:12.600
 - I think he might also drive those ones as well.

00:38:12.600 --> 00:38:14.720
 - But then does he has to drive on every single home

00:38:14.720 --> 00:38:16.040
 of every single Grammy winner?

00:38:16.040 --> 00:38:18.320
 - No, I'm sure he takes them to Mr. Grammy

00:38:18.320 --> 00:38:20.120
 who then hands them over to the people.

00:38:20.120 --> 00:38:21.480
 - There's a distribution network, he thinks.

00:38:21.480 --> 00:38:22.600
 - Yeah, yeah, I think so.

00:38:22.600 --> 00:38:23.440
 - There will be someone--

00:38:23.440 --> 00:38:25.080
 - There's a GDPR issue if he knows

00:38:25.080 --> 00:38:26.640
 where all these people live as well.

00:38:26.640 --> 00:38:28.920
 - That would be an amazing bit of information to have.

00:38:28.920 --> 00:38:29.920
 Just all the addresses

00:38:29.920 --> 00:38:31.680
 of all the most famous musicians in the world.

00:38:31.680 --> 00:38:33.320
 - Yeah, so the Grammys.

00:38:33.320 --> 00:38:36.880
 This is a thing that started in the late 1950s

00:38:36.880 --> 00:38:40.800
 and the idea behind it was that they wanted to have

00:38:40.800 --> 00:38:44.280
 something that represented the output of musicians.

00:38:44.280 --> 00:38:46.240
 It was called the Grammy because they had a competition

00:38:46.240 --> 00:38:48.880
 where they asked the Americans what do you wanna call this?

00:38:48.880 --> 00:38:50.640
 And I think it was a girl who wrote in

00:38:50.640 --> 00:38:53.600
 and said these trophies are made out of Grammys,

00:38:53.600 --> 00:38:55.360
 so why don't we call it Grammys?

00:38:55.360 --> 00:38:57.600
 (laughing)

00:38:57.600 --> 00:38:59.400
 - She was, she, a bunch of people suggested it,

00:38:59.400 --> 00:39:01.240
 but she was the first person who's later got read

00:39:01.240 --> 00:39:02.600
 with the suggestion of Grammy.

00:39:02.600 --> 00:39:04.240
 - I think she was a New Orleans secretary

00:39:04.240 --> 00:39:05.760
 called Rose Trey Elizabeth Danner.

00:39:05.760 --> 00:39:09.520
 And she was given 25 free LPs as a gift

00:39:09.520 --> 00:39:11.040
 'cause lots of people are interested in Grammy

00:39:11.040 --> 00:39:12.840
 but her letter was open first.

00:39:12.840 --> 00:39:15.480
 But she lived until February, 2014.

00:39:15.480 --> 00:39:19.480
 So she could have seen Robin Thickey performing Blurred Lines.

00:39:19.480 --> 00:39:20.560
 (laughing)

00:39:20.560 --> 00:39:22.400
 - Robin Thickey.

00:39:22.400 --> 00:39:23.560
 - Yeah, I used to call him that.

00:39:23.560 --> 00:39:26.800
 And I now, on principle, refuse to call him Robin

00:39:26.800 --> 00:39:27.640
 by any other name.

00:39:27.640 --> 00:39:30.080
 - I reckon if you were at school with Robin Thickey,

00:39:30.080 --> 00:39:32.200
 that's what you would call him.

00:39:32.200 --> 00:39:33.920
 - Oh, what a Thickey.

00:39:33.920 --> 00:39:36.240
 - There have been some pretty tedious decisions

00:39:36.240 --> 00:39:38.840
 from the Grammy board over the years, haven't there?

00:39:38.840 --> 00:39:39.680
 - It feels like you've got a few of them.

00:39:39.680 --> 00:39:40.520
 Just leave there, Anna.

00:39:40.520 --> 00:39:42.960
 - Well, I was reading an article written in 1993.

00:39:42.960 --> 00:39:45.200
 So some of these wrongs have been corrected now.

00:39:45.200 --> 00:39:48.280
 But even so, a New York Times article written in 1993

00:39:48.280 --> 00:39:51.800
 about how they just never seemed to pick the right people.

00:39:51.800 --> 00:39:56.000
 So by 1993, here are people who hadn't won a Grammy.

00:39:56.000 --> 00:39:58.280
 Eric Clapton, The Beach Boys, The Supremes,

00:39:58.280 --> 00:39:59.840
 The Grateful Dead, The Jackson Five,

00:39:59.840 --> 00:40:03.240
 Led Zeppelin, Etta James, Queen, Van Morrison.

00:40:03.240 --> 00:40:04.080
 - The Queen.

00:40:04.080 --> 00:40:06.840
 - The Queen, the Queen has won the Grammys every year,

00:40:06.840 --> 00:40:09.040
 of course, lovely voice.

00:40:09.040 --> 00:40:10.360
 Jimi Hendrix and The Rolling Stones,

00:40:10.360 --> 00:40:13.160
 the only Grammy they ever won was Lifetime Achievement.

00:40:13.160 --> 00:40:15.080
 At that point, 'cause they sometimes do this thing

00:40:15.080 --> 00:40:16.960
 where I think the judges think years afterwards,

00:40:16.960 --> 00:40:18.760
 oh, shit, they did turn out to be really good.

00:40:18.760 --> 00:40:19.600
 So then they toss a light.

00:40:19.600 --> 00:40:20.440
 - Oh, God, let's have it.

00:40:20.440 --> 00:40:21.280
 - We forgot that.

00:40:21.280 --> 00:40:22.120
 (laughing)

00:40:22.120 --> 00:40:23.480
 - Those were busy years, though.

00:40:23.480 --> 00:40:25.480
 We're talking about, in terms of rock, you know,

00:40:25.480 --> 00:40:27.120
 Hendrix would have been up against the Beatles,

00:40:27.120 --> 00:40:29.000
 up against, that was a crowd.

00:40:29.000 --> 00:40:30.160
 - They didn't like rock, though.

00:40:30.160 --> 00:40:31.960
 That was always a thing with the Grammys.

00:40:31.960 --> 00:40:34.480
 They were almost set up as an antidote

00:40:34.480 --> 00:40:36.240
 to what they considered was, I think,

00:40:36.240 --> 00:40:38.680
 was called anti-music by the people

00:40:38.680 --> 00:40:40.840
 who wanted the Grammys to come about.

00:40:40.840 --> 00:40:42.200
 They wanted to celebrate quality music,

00:40:42.200 --> 00:40:44.840
 not anti-music like R&B and rock,

00:40:44.840 --> 00:40:47.600
 which, it was like, this is a flash in the pan.

00:40:47.600 --> 00:40:50.560
 - The most Grammys is by George Salty.

00:40:50.560 --> 00:40:51.400
 - George Salty?

00:40:51.400 --> 00:40:54.720
 - And Salty's ring, actually, has been twice voted

00:40:54.720 --> 00:40:57.000
 the greatest recording ever made.

00:40:57.000 --> 00:40:57.840
 - What?

00:40:57.840 --> 00:40:58.680
 - I don't know if you know Salty's ring.

00:40:58.680 --> 00:40:59.520
 - No.

00:40:59.520 --> 00:41:00.360
 - No?

00:41:00.360 --> 00:41:01.680
 - His cycle?

00:41:01.680 --> 00:41:02.520
 His ring cycle?

00:41:02.520 --> 00:41:03.400
 (laughing)

00:41:03.400 --> 00:41:04.360
 - It's Wagner, yeah.

00:41:04.360 --> 00:41:07.520
 He's a conductor, and so he's conducted lots and lots

00:41:07.520 --> 00:41:08.800
 of things, won loads and loads of Grammys,

00:41:08.800 --> 00:41:11.840
 won 31 as a recording artist.

00:41:11.840 --> 00:41:15.200
 And yeah, Salty's ring is one of the greatest

00:41:15.200 --> 00:41:18.720
 musical pieces ever made, and it's not funny in any way.

00:41:18.720 --> 00:41:23.160
 And he was the conductor at the Covent Garden opera house.

00:41:23.160 --> 00:41:25.360
 And when he first came here,

00:41:25.360 --> 00:41:27.720
 because obviously we're in Covent Garden at the moment,

00:41:27.720 --> 00:41:30.440
 there was like a clique in Covent Garden

00:41:30.440 --> 00:41:31.840
 that really, really hated him,

00:41:31.840 --> 00:41:34.480
 'cause they didn't like when new musical directors came in,

00:41:34.480 --> 00:41:35.760
 they really hated it.

00:41:35.760 --> 00:41:37.520
 And so when he first arrived,

00:41:37.520 --> 00:41:40.200
 people threw rotten vegetables at him in the street,

00:41:40.200 --> 00:41:43.560
 and his car was vandalized outside Covent Garden Theater

00:41:43.560 --> 00:41:46.000
 where the word Salty must go

00:41:46.000 --> 00:41:48.120
 scratched into his paintwork.

00:41:48.120 --> 00:41:50.880
 - Wow, that doesn't sound like the actions of opera fans.

00:41:50.880 --> 00:41:53.000
 - Ah, it's just cliques, isn't it?

00:41:53.000 --> 00:41:54.760
 You know, it's just groups of people

00:41:54.760 --> 00:41:58.600
 don't like outsiders coming in with their Salty ways.

00:41:58.600 --> 00:42:01.280
 - They called him the Screaming Skull.

00:42:01.280 --> 00:42:02.320
 - Yeah, really?

00:42:02.320 --> 00:42:03.280
 - But I don't know if that,

00:42:03.280 --> 00:42:04.560
 I don't think that was a criticism.

00:42:04.560 --> 00:42:06.720
 I think that was more like he was quite a vigorous man

00:42:06.720 --> 00:42:08.800
 and he was bald.

00:42:08.800 --> 00:42:09.840
 But you know, conductors,

00:42:09.840 --> 00:42:12.000
 they do a lot of like shouting and gesticulating.

00:42:12.000 --> 00:42:13.000
 - Yeah, yeah.

00:42:13.000 --> 00:42:14.240
 - So Screaming Skull.

00:42:14.240 --> 00:42:16.160
 - I really like the non-famous,

00:42:16.160 --> 00:42:17.480
 the non-televised Grammy categories,

00:42:17.480 --> 00:42:18.320
 I just think they're great.

00:42:18.320 --> 00:42:19.280
 'Cause there are so many,

00:42:19.280 --> 00:42:21.200
 I didn't realize there are dozens and dozens of categories.

00:42:21.200 --> 00:42:23.280
 - But things like Best Tropical Latin Album

00:42:23.280 --> 00:42:27.400
 or Best Contemporary Christian Music Performance/Song.

00:42:27.400 --> 00:42:29.280
 And there is a screening committee

00:42:29.280 --> 00:42:31.040
 which assesses whether or not

00:42:31.040 --> 00:42:33.000
 you are actually fitting into that category or not,

00:42:33.000 --> 00:42:34.560
 'cause it would be much easier, I think,

00:42:34.560 --> 00:42:37.200
 to get a Grammy for some of these things where--

00:42:37.200 --> 00:42:40.520
 - Yeah, but we can't put Led Zeppelin in the Christian--

00:42:40.520 --> 00:42:42.120
 - No, but we, the four of us,

00:42:42.120 --> 00:42:44.480
 could make a tropical Latin album.

00:42:44.480 --> 00:42:45.320
 - Are we good?

00:42:45.320 --> 00:42:46.160
 - Oh, I see.

00:42:46.160 --> 00:42:47.000
 - Just game the system that way

00:42:47.000 --> 00:42:49.000
 by entering some of the less popular categories.

00:42:49.000 --> 00:42:52.160
 - And would that be part of our Mississippi River oeuvre

00:42:52.160 --> 00:42:54.680
 or is the tropical Latin album like the follow-up?

00:42:54.680 --> 00:42:58.040
 - I don't think you are even as in the tropics, is it?

00:42:58.040 --> 00:42:59.760
 - I don't think, no, I don't think it could be.

00:42:59.760 --> 00:43:00.600
 - No, it's like not.

00:43:00.600 --> 00:43:02.880
 - But okay, here's one we could win, Best Album Notes.

00:43:02.880 --> 00:43:03.720
 - Oh yeah.

00:43:03.720 --> 00:43:04.800
 - Which really feels like a--

00:43:04.800 --> 00:43:05.920
 - I know a winner of that.

00:43:05.920 --> 00:43:09.360
 - Not personally, but I know someone who has won that award.

00:43:09.360 --> 00:43:10.200
 - Who?

00:43:10.200 --> 00:43:11.040
 - What are the album notes?

00:43:11.040 --> 00:43:12.360
 Are they the lyrics that you write in there?

00:43:12.360 --> 00:43:14.040
 - Do you know the sleeve notes that you used to get

00:43:14.040 --> 00:43:15.840
 in a CD or in an LP?

00:43:15.840 --> 00:43:17.540
 And young listeners would have completely--

00:43:17.540 --> 00:43:18.380
 - Yeah, I do.

00:43:18.380 --> 00:43:20.560
 Where you write Beyonce, I remember a Destiny's Child,

00:43:20.560 --> 00:43:21.860
 they all wrote how much they loved God.

00:43:21.860 --> 00:43:24.280
 I found it so boring reading those things.

00:43:24.280 --> 00:43:26.920
 - Well, they might not have won that year's Best Album Notes

00:43:26.920 --> 00:43:27.760
 category.

00:43:27.760 --> 00:43:28.600
 - Dan, who do you know?

00:43:28.600 --> 00:43:29.440
 Who's been there?

00:43:29.440 --> 00:43:30.920
 - Steve Martin, the comedian, has won them.

00:43:30.920 --> 00:43:32.600
 - I bet he's written some really good album notes, yeah.

00:43:32.600 --> 00:43:35.720
 - For his banjo albums, not for his comedy albums.

00:43:35.720 --> 00:43:36.560
 - You don't know. - It feels like

00:43:36.560 --> 00:43:37.380
 it played with strings.

00:43:37.380 --> 00:43:38.220
 - Do you know Steve Martin?

00:43:38.220 --> 00:43:40.500
 - No, that's when I said I know someone,

00:43:40.500 --> 00:43:43.080
 and then I qualified it by saying I don't know them.

00:43:43.080 --> 00:43:44.400
 - Right.

00:43:44.400 --> 00:43:47.000
 So it was the last a statement was true, yeah.

00:43:47.000 --> 00:43:48.560
 - Is aware of.

00:43:48.560 --> 00:43:49.880
 I know Robin Thickey, although I don't know

00:43:49.880 --> 00:43:50.720
 how to say his name.

00:43:50.720 --> 00:43:53.120
 (all laughing)

00:43:53.120 --> 00:43:56.480
 - It's very controversial the way they vote in the Grammys.

00:43:56.480 --> 00:43:59.760
 'Cause it's, well, until this year, it was super secret.

00:43:59.760 --> 00:44:01.360
 It sounds quite exciting.

00:44:01.360 --> 00:44:04.680
 And I think what used to happen was winners were decided

00:44:04.680 --> 00:44:08.560
 by this like 12,000 strong recording Academy,

00:44:08.560 --> 00:44:12.080
 bunch of voters who, they're like.

00:44:12.080 --> 00:44:13.400
 (all laughing)

00:44:13.400 --> 00:44:15.560
 - They all stand in a room and put their hands up

00:44:15.560 --> 00:44:16.400
 and stuff, right?

00:44:16.400 --> 00:44:21.000
 - Yeah, they crush in and, yeah, someone has to count them.

00:44:21.000 --> 00:44:23.000
 They, I guess it's probably done by post

00:44:23.000 --> 00:44:24.760
 and their musicians and music makers.

00:44:24.760 --> 00:44:26.280
 - Probably you, Val, these days.

00:44:26.280 --> 00:44:28.200
 (all laughing)

00:44:28.200 --> 00:44:31.000
 - It was in the 90s that it changed.

00:44:31.000 --> 00:44:32.320
 - John Billings goes around, gets them

00:44:32.320 --> 00:44:34.160
 in the back of the van, picks up the next one.

00:44:34.160 --> 00:44:35.000
 (all laughing)

00:44:35.000 --> 00:44:37.120
 - But that's just the fake ones that he brings.

00:44:37.120 --> 00:44:39.560
 (all laughing)

00:44:39.560 --> 00:44:41.920
 So, yeah, it used to be done by this 12,000 strong

00:44:41.920 --> 00:44:43.000
 and bunch of voters.

00:44:43.000 --> 00:44:44.920
 But then I think partly because the awards

00:44:44.920 --> 00:44:47.920
 just kept going so wrong and they just kept giving it

00:44:47.920 --> 00:44:49.080
 to weird people.

00:44:49.080 --> 00:44:50.200
 They had to change the rules.

00:44:50.200 --> 00:44:51.960
 And I think the straw that broke the camel's back

00:44:51.960 --> 00:44:56.840
 came in the early 90s when over, album of the year was up

00:44:56.840 --> 00:44:59.560
 and Bruce Springsteen's "Born in the USA" was released

00:44:59.560 --> 00:45:01.360
 and "Princess Purple Rain" was released

00:45:01.360 --> 00:45:04.320
 and Lionel Richie's "Can't Slow Down" won.

00:45:04.320 --> 00:45:06.680
 And everyone said, we didn't like that.

00:45:06.680 --> 00:45:07.880
 That's not as good as the other two.

00:45:07.880 --> 00:45:10.720
 And so they formed a secret committee

00:45:10.720 --> 00:45:12.600
 which basically goes through all the 12,000 votes

00:45:12.600 --> 00:45:13.560
 and takes out the duds.

00:45:13.560 --> 00:45:15.080
 - Because actually you would think

00:45:15.080 --> 00:45:18.520
 that having a larger group, 12,000 would be more likely

00:45:18.520 --> 00:45:20.160
 to give you a democratic answer, right?

00:45:20.160 --> 00:45:21.240
 - Yeah, give you the best.

00:45:21.240 --> 00:45:23.080
 - But a democratic answer isn't necessarily

00:45:23.080 --> 00:45:24.080
 the best answer, James.

00:45:24.080 --> 00:45:24.920
 - Is that not right?

00:45:24.920 --> 00:45:25.760
 - Okay.

00:45:25.760 --> 00:45:27.360
 - That's my view.

00:45:27.360 --> 00:45:28.560
 (all laughing)

00:45:28.560 --> 00:45:31.760
 - My one way ticket to Russia is just to come through.

00:45:31.760 --> 00:45:34.440
 Anyway, people got quite pissed off

00:45:34.440 --> 00:45:35.280
 by the secret committee

00:45:35.280 --> 00:45:37.680
 because no one knew how they voted or why they voted.

00:45:37.680 --> 00:45:40.280
 And there's someone called The Weekend, I think.

00:45:40.280 --> 00:45:41.120
 - Oh, The Weekend.

00:45:41.120 --> 00:45:41.960
 - The Weekend.

00:45:41.960 --> 00:45:42.800
 - Oh, right.

00:45:42.800 --> 00:45:44.120
 (all laughing)

00:45:44.120 --> 00:45:45.320
 Well, it's spelled The Weekend.

00:45:45.320 --> 00:45:46.160
 - Weekend, yeah, yeah.

00:45:46.160 --> 00:45:47.000
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:45:47.000 --> 00:45:48.360
 (all laughing)

00:45:48.360 --> 00:45:49.200
 - They, he--

00:45:49.200 --> 00:45:50.920
 - Fred, the Robin picky, I believe.

00:45:50.920 --> 00:45:51.760
 (all laughing)

00:45:51.760 --> 00:45:54.160
 - This show has certainly weakened over the years, hasn't it?

00:45:54.160 --> 00:45:55.960
 (all laughing)

00:45:55.960 --> 00:45:57.320
 - Yeah, so it's felt like Weekend.

00:45:57.320 --> 00:45:59.760
 Anyway, but without any, so he--

00:45:59.760 --> 00:46:01.080
 - Well, with two E's.

00:46:01.080 --> 00:46:03.660
 (all laughing)

00:46:03.660 --> 00:46:06.520
 - But not three.

00:46:06.520 --> 00:46:07.920
 Anyway, The Weekend got annoyed

00:46:07.920 --> 00:46:09.880
 that he hadn't got nominated.

00:46:09.880 --> 00:46:10.920
 - He's pronounced the Weckend.

00:46:10.920 --> 00:46:13.920
 (all laughing)

00:46:13.920 --> 00:46:15.680
 Ladies and gentlemen, The Weekend.

00:46:15.680 --> 00:46:18.400
 - I just, I want a new podcast

00:46:18.400 --> 00:46:20.800
 where we give Anna the name of all the partners

00:46:20.800 --> 00:46:24.360
 that are in the charts and see if she can pronounce them.

00:46:24.360 --> 00:46:26.440
 - They've asked me to read out the nominations next show.

00:46:26.440 --> 00:46:27.800
 - I'm quite nervous now.

00:46:27.800 --> 00:46:29.400
 - Lil Nas the 10th.

00:46:29.400 --> 00:46:31.560
 (all laughing)

00:46:31.560 --> 00:46:34.400
 - I did another one, no, I know the Lil Nas is.

00:46:34.400 --> 00:46:36.980
 (upbeat music)

00:46:36.980 --> 00:46:40.560
 - Okay, that's it.
