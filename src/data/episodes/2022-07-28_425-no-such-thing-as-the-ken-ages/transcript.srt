00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,580
 (upbeat music)

2
00:00:02,580 --> 00:00:16,720
 - Hello and welcome to another episode

3
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:20,020
 of No Such Thing as a Fish, a weekly podcast coming to you

4
00:00:20,020 --> 00:00:22,800
 from the QI offices in Covent Garden.

5
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:23,920
 My name is Dan Schreiber.

6
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:27,360
 I am sitting here with Anna Tyshinski, Andrew Hunter Murray

7
00:00:27,360 --> 00:00:28,600
 and James Harkin.

8
00:00:28,600 --> 00:00:31,120
 And once again, we have gathered around the microphones

9
00:00:31,120 --> 00:00:34,320
 with our four favorite facts from the last seven days

10
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:37,820
 and in no particular order, here we go.

11
00:00:37,820 --> 00:00:41,360
 Starting with fact number one, and that is Andy.

12
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:44,260
 - My fact is that if you took all the hedges in Britain

13
00:00:44,260 --> 00:00:45,780
 and laid them end to end,

14
00:00:45,780 --> 00:00:49,380
 they would stretch to the moon and most of the way back.

15
00:00:49,380 --> 00:00:51,120
 (laughing)

16
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:52,120
 - Not like that.

17
00:00:52,120 --> 00:00:53,720
 - Grappy ending to that.

18
00:00:53,720 --> 00:00:54,800
 (laughing)

19
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:56,220
 How far back?

20
00:00:56,220 --> 00:00:58,640
 - Basically, figures vary about the exact length,

21
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:00,560
 but it would definitely get you all the way there

22
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:03,240
 and it would definitely not get you all the way back.

23
00:01:03,240 --> 00:01:06,040
 - All the alien sheep that you're kind of herding

24
00:01:06,040 --> 00:01:08,660
 into this gap between the earth and the moon,

25
00:01:08,660 --> 00:01:11,080
 they'd be able to escape from that last little gap.

26
00:01:11,080 --> 00:01:11,920
 - I don't think they would

27
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:14,940
 because there's one layer of hedging solidly between the two.

28
00:01:14,940 --> 00:01:17,080
 - Yeah, but the thing is with fences,

29
00:01:17,080 --> 00:01:19,000
 you need them on both sides of a field.

30
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,440
 - Yes, what I stupidly imagined is a sort of double row

31
00:01:21,440 --> 00:01:23,320
 of hedging that runs out halfway back,

32
00:01:23,320 --> 00:01:25,440
 but you don't actually, you don't need that.

33
00:01:25,440 --> 00:01:28,580
 - Basically, the UK has about 700,000 kilometers of hedges.

34
00:01:28,580 --> 00:01:31,620
 Some people say there are only about 500,000 kilometers

35
00:01:31,620 --> 00:01:33,700
 of hedges, so the figures do vary,

36
00:01:33,700 --> 00:01:37,340
 but it definitely is between one and two times the distance

37
00:01:37,340 --> 00:01:39,680
 between the earth and the moon, right?

38
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:43,580
 That's quite a big discrepancy, 200,000 kilometers.

39
00:01:43,580 --> 00:01:45,820
 - Yeah, I mean, it's quite hard to survey.

40
00:01:45,820 --> 00:01:47,260
 There are quite good ways of measuring now,

41
00:01:47,260 --> 00:01:49,740
 as in you can use satellites to measure the distances.

42
00:01:49,740 --> 00:01:50,780
 - Who has the time, though,

43
00:01:50,780 --> 00:01:54,300
 to go through all the hedges from satellite imagery?

44
00:01:54,300 --> 00:01:56,240
 - It feels like you have the answer to that question.

45
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:57,400
 I know you're just teaming me up.

46
00:01:57,400 --> 00:01:58,880
 (all laughing)

47
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:01,080
 - And with that, James, quit the podcast

48
00:02:01,080 --> 00:02:03,140
 to start his hedge measuring career.

49
00:02:03,140 --> 00:02:05,600
 - I was just thinking that I think

50
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:06,840
 if you have satellite imagery,

51
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:08,920
 there's more important things to do than work out

52
00:02:08,920 --> 00:02:11,640
 whether it's 200,000 or 300,000 or whatever it was.

53
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:12,640
 - It's true, it's true.

54
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:13,840
 - I'm saying this, by the way,

55
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:15,380
 as someone who has been active

56
00:02:15,380 --> 00:02:17,160
 in the hedge community in the past.

57
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:18,000
 - What do you mean?

58
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,440
 - When I lived in the countryside in the Lake District,

59
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:23,080
 when I moved in, one of the first people to come around

60
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:25,400
 was a couple saying, would you be interested

61
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:27,200
 in getting involved with the hedges?

62
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:28,040
 - Right.

63
00:02:28,040 --> 00:02:29,700
 - And it does sound like a swinging case,

64
00:02:29,700 --> 00:02:30,540
 but it certainly was.

65
00:02:30,540 --> 00:02:32,260
 (all laughing)

66
00:02:32,260 --> 00:02:34,660
 - Basically, in Silverdale, where I lived,

67
00:02:34,660 --> 00:02:36,260
 so it's just outside the Lake District,

68
00:02:36,260 --> 00:02:38,200
 the hedges were very important

69
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:39,840
 'cause they have a lot of wildlife,

70
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:42,100
 and we wanted to save them.

71
00:02:42,100 --> 00:02:44,180
 I only went to one or two meetings.

72
00:02:44,180 --> 00:02:46,260
 - So what happened at those meetings?

73
00:02:46,260 --> 00:02:47,980
 - Part of it, you might go around

74
00:02:47,980 --> 00:02:49,660
 picking stuff out of the hedges,

75
00:02:49,660 --> 00:02:51,540
 like cleaning the hedges and stuff.

76
00:02:51,540 --> 00:02:53,240
 But mostly, you're just trying to stop people

77
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:54,680
 from cutting the hedges down.

78
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:57,040
 - Or just vigilante wandering the countryside,

79
00:02:57,040 --> 00:02:59,320
 throwing yourselves at farmers.

80
00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:00,800
 - That was probably in the third meeting,

81
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:02,440
 but all that stuff happened.

82
00:03:02,440 --> 00:03:04,560
 Like the Extinction Rebellion side of it,

83
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:05,760
 I think that came later.

84
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:07,560
 It was mostly just chatting about hedges.

85
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:10,200
 - Was it, James, the National Hedge Laying Society?

86
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:12,720
 - I don't recall very well, but I don't think so.

87
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:14,000
 It was a long time ago, this.

88
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,440
 - There are a few different hedge bodies.

89
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:16,360
 - Yeah.

90
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:20,680
 - But isn't this the one grand daddy body of hedging?

91
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:22,780
 - I mean, the National Hedge Laying Society are huge.

92
00:03:22,780 --> 00:03:24,320
 - You wanted to talk about hedge laying, then, Andy,

93
00:03:24,320 --> 00:03:25,500
 which is different, of course,

94
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:27,820
 to James's hedge rubbish clearance.

95
00:03:27,820 --> 00:03:29,220
 - The National Hedge Laying Society

96
00:03:29,220 --> 00:03:30,740
 and the National Hedge Maintenance Society

97
00:03:30,740 --> 00:03:33,660
 are the jets and the sharks of the hedge world.

98
00:03:33,660 --> 00:03:35,060
 Vicious, vicious knife fights

99
00:03:35,060 --> 00:03:36,660
 between them whenever they meet.

100
00:03:36,660 --> 00:03:38,100
 Life on the hedge.

101
00:03:38,100 --> 00:03:38,940
 - God.

102
00:03:38,940 --> 00:03:40,740
 - But it is really cool hedge laying.

103
00:03:40,740 --> 00:03:42,460
 I didn't know about it.

104
00:03:42,460 --> 00:03:44,180
 I didn't know what it was.

105
00:03:44,180 --> 00:03:48,300
 And it is literally making a hedge lie down, isn't it?

106
00:03:48,300 --> 00:03:50,660
 It's flaccidating a hedge, essentially.

107
00:03:50,660 --> 00:03:52,480
 - So the hedge pre-exists.

108
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:55,320
 - A hedge has to pre-exist to lay a hedge, yes.

109
00:03:55,320 --> 00:03:57,720
 Otherwise, you're just building a hedge, I guess.

110
00:03:57,720 --> 00:03:59,120
 - So that's what I got confused about.

111
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:00,520
 I thought you have to plant a hedge, don't you?

112
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:01,360
 - Yeah, that's what I thought.

113
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:02,320
 - Well, you're planting a hedge

114
00:04:02,320 --> 00:04:03,840
 into an already existing hedge.

115
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:06,840
 So, basically, this is a way of maintaining the hedges,

116
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:08,640
 which is very important that we do,

117
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:10,200
 'cause they're so bi-diverse and stuff.

118
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:13,520
 And so you've got to stop them growing too high, too tall,

119
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:15,400
 because if the trees that make up a hedge

120
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:18,080
 turn into mature trees, then they eventually die.

121
00:04:18,080 --> 00:04:19,960
 And also, they're trunks shoot up

122
00:04:19,960 --> 00:04:21,220
 and they don't have any foliage at the bottom

123
00:04:21,220 --> 00:04:22,500
 and there are big gaps in the hedge

124
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:23,940
 and all the sheep get through.

125
00:04:23,940 --> 00:04:26,700
 And so what hedge laying is, it's really clever,

126
00:04:26,700 --> 00:04:29,980
 you turn the hedge from vertical to horizontal, essentially.

127
00:04:29,980 --> 00:04:33,820
 So you do this by kind of cutting the upright trunks

128
00:04:33,820 --> 00:04:37,820
 at the base, so you make a little slit in the upright trunk.

129
00:04:37,820 --> 00:04:39,860
 But you don't cut it all the way down to the bottom,

130
00:04:39,860 --> 00:04:41,140
 'cause you really don't wanna kill the trunk.

131
00:04:41,140 --> 00:04:43,060
 You gotta keep the sap flowing up it.

132
00:04:43,060 --> 00:04:45,900
 And when you split it, you can bend it over,

133
00:04:45,900 --> 00:04:49,100
 as you can imagine, like a hinge so that it lies down.

134
00:04:49,100 --> 00:04:50,720
 And then when you do that,

135
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:54,160
 then it will start growing new hedgery upwards.

136
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:55,880
 So you've got to keep on bending it over

137
00:04:55,880 --> 00:04:58,240
 so a new youthful bit shoots up.

138
00:04:58,240 --> 00:04:59,560
 - That's very clever, that's great, I didn't know that.

139
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:00,920
 - And it's called "pleaching."

140
00:05:00,920 --> 00:05:01,760
 - "Pleaching."

141
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:03,080
 - The "pleach" and the "ligger" is the bit

142
00:05:03,080 --> 00:05:05,360
 on the hedge that's horizontal, if you ever wanna.

143
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:06,880
 - Wow, that's good new words.

144
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:07,720
 - "Pleaching" and "liggering."

145
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:08,560
 - "Pleaching."

146
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:10,280
 Most hedges I've seen in the photos

147
00:05:10,280 --> 00:05:11,120
 while researching this,

148
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:12,800
 they sort of look like they've been blown

149
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:15,000
 to a 45 degree angle by the wind.

150
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,320
 - It's very controversial, the angle at which you should

151
00:05:17,320 --> 00:05:20,500
 put it, and there are 35 different types of hedge laying,

152
00:05:20,500 --> 00:05:23,340
 and people say 30 degrees, 45 occasionally.

153
00:05:23,340 --> 00:05:24,900
 I don't know where you saw this hedge.

154
00:05:24,900 --> 00:05:27,500
 - It was on actually the official bodies website, so.

155
00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:30,200
 - Right, so they've made a statement with that angle.

156
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:31,040
 - It's a good website, isn't it?

157
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:32,900
 The National Hedge Laying Bodies website.

158
00:05:32,900 --> 00:05:37,900
 - I think that's being very kind, it's nice, it's pleasant.

159
00:05:37,900 --> 00:05:39,940
 - Wow.

160
00:05:39,940 --> 00:05:42,380
 - What do you think were its main drawbacks?

161
00:05:42,380 --> 00:05:43,780
 - To be honest, I looked at it and thought I might

162
00:05:43,780 --> 00:05:45,940
 get in touch and just give some suggestions.

163
00:05:45,940 --> 00:05:48,720
 I thought there was a lot of information missing.

164
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:52,200
 There was a lot of, yeah, there was a lot more they could do

165
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:55,160
 with their annual award for best hedge.

166
00:05:55,160 --> 00:05:56,000
 - What could they do?

167
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:59,600
 - More photos, more understanding of what had happened.

168
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:01,360
 If you're a novice, like me coming to it.

169
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:03,040
 - Like match reports, 'cause they do have

170
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:05,160
 an annual championship, you're right, yeah, yeah.

171
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:06,840
 - Yeah, the National Hedge Laying Championship.

172
00:06:06,840 --> 00:06:08,280
 - I did want a bit more pros, actually,

173
00:06:08,280 --> 00:06:11,280
 of what had happened in each year's championships.

174
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:12,440
 They just give us the kind of winners

175
00:06:12,440 --> 00:06:13,280
 and the runners up.

176
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:14,840
 - Can I, sorry, can I just ask a question?

177
00:06:14,840 --> 00:06:17,340
 Is it for the person who's best at bending the hedges

178
00:06:17,340 --> 00:06:19,060
 or is it for the actual best hedge?

179
00:06:19,060 --> 00:06:19,900
 - Great question.

180
00:06:19,900 --> 00:06:21,640
 I would have loved to have got the answer

181
00:06:21,640 --> 00:06:22,740
 as I read the website.

182
00:06:22,740 --> 00:06:24,360
 - I did get the answer from the website

183
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:26,000
 because it's the former.

184
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:29,200
 It's not the best, it's the person who's laying the hedge.

185
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:30,040
 - Yeah.

186
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:31,700
 - You have to scroll down, so there's a bar

187
00:06:31,700 --> 00:06:32,940
 at the side of the website often

188
00:06:32,940 --> 00:06:35,100
 and you get the down arrow at the bottom.

189
00:06:35,100 --> 00:06:35,940
 - Is that what it is?

190
00:06:35,940 --> 00:06:37,420
 - You get more, it's like turning a page

191
00:06:37,420 --> 00:06:39,700
 but on your laptop, it's amazing.

192
00:06:39,700 --> 00:06:42,220
 - 'Cause I presume like hedges are hundreds,

193
00:06:42,220 --> 00:06:43,940
 if not thousands of years old, right?

194
00:06:43,940 --> 00:06:46,540
 And they don't change that much from year to year.

195
00:06:46,540 --> 00:06:49,280
 So whatever's the best hedge in 2019 is likely

196
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:52,000
 to be the best hedge in 2020 and 2021.

197
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,360
 Do you know how to tell how old a hedge is?

198
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:55,200
 No.

199
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:56,040
 - Ask it nicely.

200
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:56,960
 - There's a thing called Hooper's Rule.

201
00:06:56,960 --> 00:06:59,360
 No, it's very rude to ask a hedge its age.

202
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:00,600
 - Oh, right, good to know.

203
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:01,980
 - There's a thing called Hooper's Rule.

204
00:07:01,980 --> 00:07:04,120
 It's named after a guy called M.D. Hooper,

205
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:05,760
 who is one of the people who invented it.

206
00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:09,480
 And you take a 30-yard stretch of hedge,

207
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:12,080
 you count the number of species in it,

208
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:17,080
 you multiply that number by 110 and then you add 30 years.

209
00:07:17,080 --> 00:07:20,820
 And that will tell you exactly how old a hedge is

210
00:07:20,820 --> 00:07:22,340
 and it's called Hooper's Rule.

211
00:07:22,340 --> 00:07:26,020
 And it was published in the '70s and almost immediately,

212
00:07:26,020 --> 00:07:28,860
 someone else did a publication saying it's complete bollocks.

213
00:07:28,860 --> 00:07:30,900
 (laughing)

214
00:07:30,900 --> 00:07:32,980
 At very best, it can give you an approximation

215
00:07:32,980 --> 00:07:36,340
 and you should always use village or council

216
00:07:36,340 --> 00:07:38,700
 or parish history.

217
00:07:38,700 --> 00:07:40,180
 - Also, that's gonna be a hell of a lot quicker

218
00:07:40,180 --> 00:07:41,660
 than counting meticulously.

219
00:07:41,660 --> 00:07:43,840
 All the species in a hedge.

220
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:45,120
 - There's a guy, and this was in the article

221
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:47,160
 that you sent Andy, where you found your fact from,

222
00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:50,000
 where he spent two years, he's a British ecologist,

223
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,960
 spent two years looking at all of the species

224
00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:54,200
 inside one particular bit of hedgerow.

225
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:57,760
 And he counted 2,070 in total over those years.

226
00:07:57,760 --> 00:07:58,920
 And this is not the wood.

227
00:07:58,920 --> 00:08:02,640
 This is like little ants and animals and so on.

228
00:08:02,640 --> 00:08:04,400
 - And he's amazing.

229
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:07,080
 Robert Walton, he was challenged during a car journey

230
00:08:07,080 --> 00:08:09,520
 by another friend of his, another naturalist.

231
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:11,040
 Not sure what the exact terms of the challenge were,

232
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:13,300
 but it's basically why didn't you study that hedge

233
00:08:13,300 --> 00:08:14,300
 for a very long time?

234
00:08:14,300 --> 00:08:15,140
 (laughing)

235
00:08:15,140 --> 00:08:16,340
 And he spent a year on it and he's like,

236
00:08:16,340 --> 00:08:18,660
 "God, I'm still getting loads every single week."

237
00:08:18,660 --> 00:08:21,180
 So he spent another, spent a second year on it.

238
00:08:21,180 --> 00:08:22,020
 It was incredible.

239
00:08:22,020 --> 00:08:23,620
 He reckoned there were more than 3,000,

240
00:08:23,620 --> 00:08:24,740
 but he could only count 2,000

241
00:08:24,740 --> 00:08:25,940
 'cause they were with the naked eye

242
00:08:25,940 --> 00:08:27,540
 that he was looking at them.

243
00:08:27,540 --> 00:08:29,340
 2,000 species is the most detailed study

244
00:08:29,340 --> 00:08:30,460
 of a hedge ever made.

245
00:08:30,460 --> 00:08:32,340
 Ever.

246
00:08:32,340 --> 00:08:33,980
 I can't believe no one else has done this.

247
00:08:33,980 --> 00:08:35,140
 - Yeah, I know, it's weird, isn't it?

248
00:08:35,140 --> 00:08:35,980
 Well, that's what he was saying.

249
00:08:35,980 --> 00:08:36,940
 It's bizarre how important they are

250
00:08:36,940 --> 00:08:39,940
 that we know so little about what's in them, in a way.

251
00:08:39,940 --> 00:08:41,880
 And also, they've been quite denigrated hedges.

252
00:08:41,880 --> 00:08:43,800
 They've had a bad rep for ages.

253
00:08:43,800 --> 00:08:45,240
 Definitely, when I was growing up,

254
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:49,280
 I thought that the hedge was often quite new, right?

255
00:08:49,280 --> 00:08:51,040
 'Cause you learned about enclosure.

256
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:52,000
 This is the big deal.

257
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,320
 God, it's drilled into you at school.

258
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:55,720
 Enclosure, agricultural revolution.

259
00:08:55,720 --> 00:08:57,240
 You build hedges all around the fields

260
00:08:57,240 --> 00:08:58,440
 and there's this common misconception

261
00:08:58,440 --> 00:09:00,360
 and it's still on loads of sites today

262
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:02,480
 that the hedges just came up in enclosure

263
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:04,280
 when the landowners locked off their fields.

264
00:09:04,280 --> 00:09:06,080
 - I don't think every listener's gonna know about enclosure.

265
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:07,160
 I think we should say a bit.

266
00:09:07,160 --> 00:09:09,040
 - No, that's, if you don't remember,

267
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:12,820
 if you're not English and don't remember your year A history.

268
00:09:12,820 --> 00:09:13,660
 - So what is it?

269
00:09:13,660 --> 00:09:14,580
 I don't know this.

270
00:09:14,580 --> 00:09:15,820
 - In the agricultural revolution,

271
00:09:15,820 --> 00:09:20,220
 landowners decided to end the common land usage policies

272
00:09:20,220 --> 00:09:21,180
 that have been existing so far

273
00:09:21,180 --> 00:09:22,860
 where everyone could graze their animals and plant

274
00:09:22,860 --> 00:09:24,260
 when they wanted to do common land

275
00:09:24,260 --> 00:09:27,100
 and they enclose their land with fences and hedges.

276
00:09:27,100 --> 00:09:29,780
 And that's where a lot of people think,

277
00:09:29,780 --> 00:09:31,620
 this grand misconception arises,

278
00:09:31,620 --> 00:09:33,020
 that hedges were all planted.

279
00:09:33,020 --> 00:09:34,700
 So loads of hedges in the south of England

280
00:09:34,700 --> 00:09:36,580
 do come from the 17th and 18th century.

281
00:09:36,580 --> 00:09:40,960
 - You basically cut down the entire of year eight history

282
00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:42,480
 into about two sentences.

283
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:43,320
 - There we go.

284
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:44,320
 And now I've told you it's wrong.

285
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:45,160
 (laughing)

286
00:09:45,160 --> 00:09:46,480
 They're all really old.

287
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:47,320
 - Wow.

288
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:48,680
 Welcome to year nine, bitches.

289
00:09:48,680 --> 00:09:50,160
 (laughing)

290
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:51,700
 Everything is a lie.

291
00:09:51,700 --> 00:09:53,160
 - Forget what you heard.

292
00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:54,040
 - Like me in year eight,

293
00:09:54,040 --> 00:09:55,960
 I still stopped listening half way through.

294
00:09:55,960 --> 00:09:57,360
 What was I saying?

295
00:09:57,360 --> 00:09:59,320
 - Guarantee you can't find enclosure

296
00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:00,760
 10 seconds after hearing about it.

297
00:10:00,760 --> 00:10:02,280
 And so people thought we could cut them down

298
00:10:02,280 --> 00:10:03,120
 'cause they're new,

299
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:05,480
 so they weren't part of the intrinsic landscape

300
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:06,560
 that's full of these amazing,

301
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:07,380
 ecosystem.

302
00:10:07,380 --> 00:10:09,740
 - A lot of them are like between parishes,

303
00:10:09,740 --> 00:10:10,580
 for instance,

304
00:10:10,580 --> 00:10:12,780
 which goes back thousands of years.

305
00:10:12,780 --> 00:10:14,340
 And even before that,

306
00:10:14,340 --> 00:10:16,740
 just people when we first got the sheep's over,

307
00:10:16,740 --> 00:10:19,740
 just trying to keep your sheep in one place kind of thing.

308
00:10:19,740 --> 00:10:22,060
 - They kind of function as motorways for species.

309
00:10:22,060 --> 00:10:24,420
 Mice get around the countryside on them.

310
00:10:24,420 --> 00:10:25,860
 The animals use them for navigation.

311
00:10:25,860 --> 00:10:27,780
 The birds nesting,

312
00:10:27,780 --> 00:10:29,660
 it's really vital that they exist.

313
00:10:29,660 --> 00:10:32,420
 And the UK destroyed about half of its hedging

314
00:10:32,420 --> 00:10:33,820
 in the 20th century.

315
00:10:33,820 --> 00:10:35,260
 So you would have been able to get to the moon

316
00:10:35,260 --> 00:10:36,260
 and back again.

317
00:10:36,260 --> 00:10:38,340
 And then maybe to the moon again,

318
00:10:38,340 --> 00:10:40,320
 in the good old days in the 1930s.

319
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:42,280
 And the reason the UK destroyed half of its hedging,

320
00:10:42,280 --> 00:10:44,300
 give or take is because of Hitler.

321
00:10:44,300 --> 00:10:46,260
 - Oh, he always gets the blame, doesn't he?

322
00:10:46,260 --> 00:10:47,100
 - Get into that give or take.

323
00:10:47,100 --> 00:10:49,480
 - More I hear about that man.

324
00:10:49,480 --> 00:10:51,500
 - So the UK wanted to be quite food sufficient

325
00:10:51,500 --> 00:10:52,680
 after the Second World War,

326
00:10:52,680 --> 00:10:55,020
 because there had been a few problems

327
00:10:55,020 --> 00:10:57,720
 with food supplies during the war.

328
00:10:57,720 --> 00:10:59,800
 And so various governments incentivized farmers

329
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:01,540
 to make their fields much bigger,

330
00:11:01,540 --> 00:11:03,800
 remove the hedges, join them all up,

331
00:11:03,800 --> 00:11:06,760
 just so you could grow larger amounts of crops.

332
00:11:06,760 --> 00:11:07,960
 And they were actually incentivized.

333
00:11:07,960 --> 00:11:10,200
 Farmers were paid to get rid of their hedges.

334
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:12,280
 And only in the last 20 years,

335
00:11:12,280 --> 00:11:13,860
 I think has it been truly appreciated

336
00:11:13,860 --> 00:11:17,040
 just what a lot of damage this did to biodiversity

337
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:18,240
 and all sorts of things.

338
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:21,960
 And so now there are aims to build many more hedges,

339
00:11:21,960 --> 00:11:23,380
 not only to fight climate change,

340
00:11:23,380 --> 00:11:25,000
 but to build biodiversity.

341
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,880
 - And against the Nazis.

342
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:29,280
 - And to just keep the Nazis down,

343
00:11:29,280 --> 00:11:31,080
 just to stop and coming back.

344
00:11:31,080 --> 00:11:32,920
 - Do you want some other hedge words, by the way?

345
00:11:32,920 --> 00:11:33,760
 - Oh yeah.

346
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:35,320
 - See, that is giving us some great hedge words.

347
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:37,120
 These are actually words in the OED

348
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:39,440
 that have the word hedge in them.

349
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:43,080
 So to hedge hop, you know what hedge hopping is?

350
00:11:43,080 --> 00:11:46,160
 - Is that to, there's a field of hedgehogs

351
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:47,800
 and you're not allowed to touch the ground.

352
00:11:47,800 --> 00:11:49,360
 It's like the floor is lava.

353
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:50,200
 - It's a game.

354
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:51,640
 - Yeah, you have to get to the other side.

355
00:11:51,640 --> 00:11:53,400
 - Trampling a hedgehog with every bound.

356
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:55,640
 - I'm not saying it's a nice game, I'm just saying.

357
00:11:55,640 --> 00:11:57,240
 - Again, once you've torn the hedges down,

358
00:11:57,240 --> 00:11:59,320
 why don't you do this hedgehog trampling game?

359
00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:01,080
 - It's not that, thankfully.

360
00:12:01,080 --> 00:12:03,520
 It's a colloquial term for flying your aircraft

361
00:12:03,520 --> 00:12:04,800
 at a very low level,

362
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:06,760
 so as if you're hopping over hedges.

363
00:12:06,760 --> 00:12:08,080
 - Oh, nice, lovely, got it.

364
00:12:08,080 --> 00:12:10,640
 - Hedge wine is very poor quality wine.

365
00:12:10,640 --> 00:12:14,000
 And in fact, hedge is used to mean poor quality.

366
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:17,280
 And also hedge wench, do you know what a hedge wench is?

367
00:12:17,280 --> 00:12:20,280
 - Well, a wench is a lusty woman.

368
00:12:20,280 --> 00:12:22,120
 - And hedge is poor quality.

369
00:12:22,120 --> 00:12:23,920
 So it's a poor quality lusty woman.

370
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:24,760
 (laughing)

371
00:12:24,760 --> 00:12:26,280
 - This is a bit more literal.

372
00:12:26,280 --> 00:12:29,280
 It's a sex worker who plays their trade in a hedge.

373
00:12:29,280 --> 00:12:30,120
 - Oh, golly.

374
00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:32,280
 - That's a painful, are people paying extra for that?

375
00:12:32,280 --> 00:12:34,520
 Or are you going to get a prickle?

376
00:12:34,520 --> 00:12:35,360
 - In a hedge.

377
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:36,560
 - In a hedge, yeah.

378
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:38,160
 - We could go back to my place actually,

379
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:39,160
 just think about it now.

380
00:12:39,160 --> 00:12:40,800
 (laughing)

381
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:44,600
 I do think the hedge is going to detract from the experience.

382
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:47,080
 There are 2,000 species and they're all watching at the moment

383
00:12:47,080 --> 00:12:47,920
 and I don't like it.

384
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:49,400
 Oh, God.

385
00:12:49,400 --> 00:12:51,080
 - A lot of ants up the bum.

386
00:12:51,080 --> 00:12:53,040
 Do you know what this proverb means?

387
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:56,040
 It's good sheltering under an old hedge.

388
00:12:56,040 --> 00:12:57,560
 It's a very old American proverb.

389
00:12:57,560 --> 00:12:59,640
 - Does it mean literally exactly what it sounds like?

390
00:12:59,640 --> 00:13:01,000
 (laughing)

391
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,160
 If you find an old hedge,

392
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:04,960
 you're probably going to be sheltered quite nicely.

393
00:13:04,960 --> 00:13:06,080
 - It sounds like it does.

394
00:13:06,080 --> 00:13:07,400
 It's actually more cryptic than that.

395
00:13:07,400 --> 00:13:10,240
 It means it's good to marry an older woman.

396
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:12,040
 She's the old hedge.

397
00:13:12,040 --> 00:13:14,640
 Cause I guess she's more experienced.

398
00:13:14,640 --> 00:13:15,480
 - Thicker.

399
00:13:15,480 --> 00:13:18,240
 (laughing)

400
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:19,520
 - She's been laid by many men before.

401
00:13:19,520 --> 00:13:21,760
 (laughing)

402
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:24,340
 (upbeat music)

403
00:13:24,340 --> 00:13:28,800
 - Okay, it is time for fact number two

404
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:30,520
 and that is Anna.

405
00:13:30,520 --> 00:13:32,840
 - My fact this week is that in the 1940s,

406
00:13:32,840 --> 00:13:35,840
 prisoners of war in the US helped build a model

407
00:13:35,840 --> 00:13:37,240
 of the Mississippi basin

408
00:13:37,240 --> 00:13:40,160
 that was about twice the size of the Vatican.

409
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:41,480
 - Wow.

410
00:13:41,480 --> 00:13:43,920
 - God, it's actually so many elements in that fact

411
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:45,680
 that I'd be impressed if you got to the end of it.

412
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:46,520
 But.

413
00:13:46,520 --> 00:13:49,120
 - So I don't know what a model of the Mississippi basin was

414
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:50,960
 before hearing about this fact.

415
00:13:50,960 --> 00:13:52,080
 - Okay, does that mean you,

416
00:13:52,080 --> 00:13:53,760
 cause you know what a model is presumably.

417
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:54,600
 - I certainly do.

418
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:56,880
 - And you know what the Mississippi is.

419
00:13:56,880 --> 00:14:00,000
 But I'm conceptually incapable of joining those two together.

420
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:00,920
 (laughing)

421
00:14:00,920 --> 00:14:02,240
 Is what we've learned.

422
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:03,440
 (laughing)

423
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:05,880
 - Well, for those of you who are, you know,

424
00:14:05,880 --> 00:14:08,080
 imaginationally absent at home,

425
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:11,640
 it's a model of a river and it's surrounding land.

426
00:14:11,640 --> 00:14:13,520
 - But a river's made of water.

427
00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:14,360
 - Yeah.

428
00:14:14,360 --> 00:14:15,200
 - Yeah.

429
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:18,840
 - So for water in the model, they use water.

430
00:14:18,840 --> 00:14:20,920
 - They also have to model the banks

431
00:14:20,920 --> 00:14:22,720
 otherwise that's just a puddle on the floor.

432
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:23,560
 - Yeah, exactly.

433
00:14:23,560 --> 00:14:25,000
 Yeah, yeah, I see, okay.

434
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:28,480
 - So you've modeled everything surrounding the river,

435
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:30,200
 basically, and then just pour water into it.

436
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:32,720
 - All like the flood plains and stuff like that, right?

437
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:33,560
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

438
00:14:33,560 --> 00:14:35,840
 - All the land around it that might be affected by it.

439
00:14:35,840 --> 00:14:37,160
 - Exactly, yeah, yeah.

440
00:14:37,160 --> 00:14:38,400
 - Why did we want to muddle it, I guess?

441
00:14:38,400 --> 00:14:40,240
 - Well, we wanted to figure out how it worked

442
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:41,200
 and get to know it better.

443
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:43,760
 So this was called the Mississippi River Basin

444
00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:47,400
 Model Waterways Experiment Station near Clinton, Mississippi.

445
00:14:47,400 --> 00:14:50,800
 And it was built because the Mississippi was always flooding

446
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:53,400
 and actually they just had a couple of really awful floods.

447
00:14:53,400 --> 00:14:56,520
 So in 1927, there was the worst flood in US history.

448
00:14:56,520 --> 00:14:58,640
 1937, another bad one.

449
00:14:58,640 --> 00:15:01,680
 And this guy called Eugene Raybold said,

450
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:04,240
 the problem we're having is that whenever there's a flood,

451
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:05,360
 we try and fix it,

452
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:07,400
 and this is a problem with flooding today still,

453
00:15:07,400 --> 00:15:09,080
 but we try and fix it in the individual place

454
00:15:09,080 --> 00:15:12,480
 where there was a flood, so we'll build a levee or a dam.

455
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:15,080
 But that's not understanding the river as a whole.

456
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:17,000
 And that just has a knock on effect further down.

457
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,840
 You're just kicking it further down the road.

458
00:15:18,840 --> 00:15:21,600
 So what we need to do is we need to build the whole river.

459
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:24,240
 And he was quite sure on laborers

460
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:25,720
 'cause everyone was fighting in the war,

461
00:15:25,720 --> 00:15:26,560
 for what there were,

462
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:29,000
 were quite a lot of German and Italian prisoners of war.

463
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,400
 And so they all must have been so confused

464
00:15:31,400 --> 00:15:34,520
 when they were carted to prisoner of war camp in Mississippi

465
00:15:34,520 --> 00:15:37,040
 and told to build the Mississippi River again.

466
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:39,280
 - For those men getting home after the war,

467
00:15:39,280 --> 00:15:41,320
 after the, oh, Hans, we're so worried.

468
00:15:41,320 --> 00:15:43,520
 You know, you were kept as a prisoner of war.

469
00:15:43,520 --> 00:15:44,640
 It must have been awful.

470
00:15:44,640 --> 00:15:46,000
 What did they make you do?

471
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,520
 Oh, you know, just really,

472
00:15:47,520 --> 00:15:48,880
 it was really difficult actually.

473
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:50,160
 Yeah, but what were you doing, Hans?

474
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:52,280
 Were you maybe picking cotton in the fields

475
00:15:52,280 --> 00:15:53,680
 or working in a mine?

476
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:56,680
 Yeah, I mean, you know, we don't model, model building.

477
00:15:56,680 --> 00:15:59,200
 - Like that's, it's twice the size of the Vatican.

478
00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:01,760
 I reckon there was a lot of earth being moved around, right?

479
00:16:01,760 --> 00:16:02,800
 - Yeah, it's not model building,

480
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:04,360
 like a wallhammer fanatic.

481
00:16:04,360 --> 00:16:05,400
 (all laughing)

482
00:16:05,400 --> 00:16:08,000
 - It wasn't a ground build, they didn't come to play with it.

483
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,760
 Basically, that's what they were doing.

484
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:12,120
 - It feels to me like I wouldn't personally

485
00:16:12,120 --> 00:16:14,800
 want to be part of that team, you know?

486
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:16,040
 - Given the choice between that

487
00:16:16,040 --> 00:16:18,080
 and other prisoner of war labor,

488
00:16:18,080 --> 00:16:20,080
 like absolutely will be on model road.

489
00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:21,040
 - Team fake river.

490
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:22,960
 - Model railway, I've given away my address there.

491
00:16:22,960 --> 00:16:25,000
 (all laughing)

492
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,280
 - River modeling duty, yeah.

493
00:16:26,280 --> 00:16:27,120
 - How big was it, Anna?

494
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:27,960
 Sorry, I missed that.

495
00:16:27,960 --> 00:16:28,800
 - So, I haven't actually said it.

496
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:30,920
 I've just said it was about twice the size of the Vatican.

497
00:16:30,920 --> 00:16:33,000
 - But you know how big the Vatican is.

498
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,200
 - And you know what twice is.

499
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:36,760
 Can you not put those two concepts together?

500
00:16:36,760 --> 00:16:38,520
 - I can't actually think of how big the Vatican,

501
00:16:38,520 --> 00:16:41,640
 because the Vatican is a whole city, right?

502
00:16:41,640 --> 00:16:42,480
 Like it's big.

503
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:43,520
 - It's difficult, it's difficult.

504
00:16:43,520 --> 00:16:45,080
 - But it's not a big city, you know that.

505
00:16:45,080 --> 00:16:47,160
 - Yeah, but okay, that still doesn't help.

506
00:16:47,160 --> 00:16:49,280
 - I reckon it's about a square kilometer, is it?

507
00:16:49,280 --> 00:16:51,680
 - It's, well, I can give you another measure.

508
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:54,840
 It was also about the size of 120 football pitches.

509
00:16:54,840 --> 00:16:56,840
 It was 210 acres.

510
00:16:56,840 --> 00:16:58,440
 - Can we get it in hedges next time?

511
00:16:58,440 --> 00:17:01,920
 - Sorry, distance to the moon, it's, God knows.

512
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:03,600
 - It's so huge, this thing.

513
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:06,520
 The streams in this thing are eight miles long in total.

514
00:17:06,520 --> 00:17:08,160
 Like it's really big.

515
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:09,600
 - Yeah, and the only way you could see it all

516
00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:12,520
 was from an observation point that was four stories tall,

517
00:17:12,520 --> 00:17:13,360
 wasn't it?

518
00:17:13,360 --> 00:17:15,400
 So you had to climb right the way up,

519
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:17,120
 and then you could see the whole thing.

520
00:17:17,120 --> 00:17:17,960
 - Yeah.

521
00:17:17,960 --> 00:17:20,040
 - One gallon of water in the thing

522
00:17:20,040 --> 00:17:24,480
 represented 1.5 million gallons of water in the real world.

523
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:26,520
 - Very cool. - So cool.

524
00:17:26,520 --> 00:17:29,640
 - I think five minutes of water running through the basin

525
00:17:29,640 --> 00:17:33,000
 simulated an entire day of water running through the Mississippi.

526
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:34,560
 So you could quite quickly work out.

527
00:17:34,560 --> 00:17:35,560
 And it was super useful.

528
00:17:35,560 --> 00:17:37,720
 It was a few years after it was built.

529
00:17:37,720 --> 00:17:38,920
 There were some signs of flooding.

530
00:17:38,920 --> 00:17:40,360
 People were getting a bit nervous.

531
00:17:40,360 --> 00:17:41,800
 Signs of flooding in the Missouri River,

532
00:17:41,800 --> 00:17:44,240
 which is a tributary of the Mississippi,

533
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:45,640
 longest river in the US.

534
00:17:45,640 --> 00:17:49,320
 And so they simulated what was happening in the little model.

535
00:17:49,320 --> 00:17:50,400
 And they said, oh, shit, yeah, it's

536
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:52,440
 going to flood here and there, not too much there.

537
00:17:52,440 --> 00:17:53,560
 Build it down there.

538
00:17:53,560 --> 00:17:55,880
 And they did and saved a few million quid.

539
00:17:55,880 --> 00:17:57,160
 - That's amazing.

540
00:17:57,160 --> 00:18:00,440
 I was thinking about the songs, because it's really tied

541
00:18:00,440 --> 00:18:01,040
 into blues.

542
00:18:01,040 --> 00:18:04,120
 And it's also a river that comes up a lot in songs.

543
00:18:04,120 --> 00:18:05,480
 And for me, I love Jeff Buckley.

544
00:18:05,480 --> 00:18:06,480
 - Like Old Man River.

545
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:09,160
 - Like Old Man River, Jeff Buckley drowned in the Mississippi.

546
00:18:09,160 --> 00:18:09,640
 - Did he?

547
00:18:09,640 --> 00:18:11,920
 - Yeah, and that, so for me, it's a river

548
00:18:11,920 --> 00:18:13,880
 that I've always noticed in songs.

549
00:18:13,880 --> 00:18:16,040
 So I was looking into it, and I found out that actually,

550
00:18:16,040 --> 00:18:20,000
 the Mississippi River actually had a sign to it,

551
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:23,000
 a songwriter and singer called Charlie Maguire.

552
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,400
 And he was the singing ranger.

553
00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:26,240
 - What's the job, sorry?

554
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:27,440
 - He goes around.

555
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:29,800
 - Yeah, he writes songs about the Mississippi.

556
00:18:29,800 --> 00:18:32,880
 - I better use the word hippie quite a lot.

557
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:35,920
 - Dippy, are you going for a Dippy in the Mississippi?

558
00:18:35,920 --> 00:18:38,560
 It's going to get pretty nippy, get slippy, love.

559
00:18:38,560 --> 00:18:40,600
 We could do this job, it's pretty easy.

560
00:18:40,600 --> 00:18:43,320
 - Yeah, no, he wrote a lot of songs at his time.

561
00:18:43,320 --> 00:18:46,360
 So, and the songs would embody the story of the Mississippi.

562
00:18:46,360 --> 00:18:48,760
 So one song was called Great Mississippi.

563
00:18:48,760 --> 00:18:50,560
 That was about where it starts and where it ends.

564
00:18:50,560 --> 00:18:51,240
 - The route one.

565
00:18:51,240 --> 00:18:52,200
 - Rock strata.

566
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:53,320
 - When was this guy's story?

567
00:18:53,320 --> 00:18:54,200
 - 2003.

568
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:54,880
 - Oh, wow.

569
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:56,040
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

570
00:18:56,040 --> 00:18:57,600
 The singing ranger is the only person

571
00:18:57,600 --> 00:18:59,120
 that's ever been given this position.

572
00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:01,920
 And yeah, he wrote tons of songs, won lots of awards.

573
00:19:01,920 --> 00:19:03,160
 Not Grammys.

574
00:19:03,160 --> 00:19:03,920
 - No Grammys.

575
00:19:03,920 --> 00:19:05,960
 - Was it awards for best song about the Mississippi

576
00:19:05,960 --> 00:19:09,080
 written by the person employed by the songs about the Mississippi?

577
00:19:09,080 --> 00:19:10,640
 - I reckon we've got a chance this year

578
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:12,120
 with the old nippy song.

579
00:19:12,120 --> 00:19:15,000
 - I had to completely agree.

580
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:16,640
 - Here's a cool thing about the Mississippi.

581
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:19,400
 It's a map that was published of the river.

582
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:22,240
 And it was published in 1866.

583
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:24,960
 And it's called The Ribbon Map of the Father of Waters.

584
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:26,240
 And it's a strip map.

585
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:30,360
 So the map was 11 feet long, but only three inches wide.

586
00:19:30,360 --> 00:19:31,200
 - Oh my gosh.

587
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:32,040
 - I know.

588
00:19:32,040 --> 00:19:33,680
 It's really funny.

589
00:19:33,680 --> 00:19:35,120
 Strip maps used to be really big.

590
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:36,520
 So that these just weren't really long.

591
00:19:36,520 --> 00:19:38,040
 - Really long.

592
00:19:38,040 --> 00:19:39,680
 If you were planning a specific trip,

593
00:19:39,680 --> 00:19:41,440
 and this is ages and centuries ago,

594
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:43,000
 you might have a strip map.

595
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:44,720
 If you were going on a pilgrimage to Jerusalem,

596
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:47,160
 'cause it's basically one route.

597
00:19:47,160 --> 00:19:48,560
 And it says turn left at this town

598
00:19:48,560 --> 00:19:50,360
 and then go straight along here for another five miles

599
00:19:50,360 --> 00:19:51,960
 and then turn right at whatever.

600
00:19:51,960 --> 00:19:54,000
 And it was on a spool, basically.

601
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,600
 So you just spool along as you went.

602
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:58,720
 I think it was more for tourism purposes than for cartography.

603
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:00,080
 - I might be wrong about this.

604
00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:02,640
 I think they used to have like GPS's of those, did they?

605
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:03,480
 - Yes, they did.

606
00:20:03,480 --> 00:20:04,840
 I met the guy who owns loads of them.

607
00:20:04,840 --> 00:20:06,280
 I borrowed some from him.

608
00:20:06,280 --> 00:20:08,240
 And you put a wristwatch on exactly like James says,

609
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:09,640
 like London to Brighton.

610
00:20:09,640 --> 00:20:12,200
 You just load in the cartridge for London to Brighton.

611
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:14,160
 And then as you're driving along, you just wind on a bit.

612
00:20:14,160 --> 00:20:15,000
 - So clever. - So clever.

613
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:16,000
 - Oh, wow.

614
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,400
 - Crawly. - That's so cool.

615
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:18,640
 (laughing)

616
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:19,640
 - Wow.

617
00:20:19,640 --> 00:20:20,480
 - Yeah, really fun.

618
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:22,280
 - What happens if there's a closed road?

619
00:20:22,280 --> 00:20:23,120
 - You're stuffed.

620
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:23,960
 - Yeah, you're stuffed.

621
00:20:23,960 --> 00:20:25,480
 - You can only go in that.

622
00:20:25,480 --> 00:20:27,480
 It only tells you that you're on the right route.

623
00:20:27,480 --> 00:20:28,840
 - Or you need to have several,

624
00:20:28,840 --> 00:20:30,600
 the whole back of your car is full.

625
00:20:30,600 --> 00:20:32,600
 It's tiny. - Car refurbification.

626
00:20:32,600 --> 00:20:33,520
 - Exactly.

627
00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:34,520
 (laughing)

628
00:20:34,520 --> 00:20:36,160
 - James Robert Scott.

629
00:20:36,160 --> 00:20:37,000
 You know him?

630
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:37,840
 - No.

631
00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:40,800
 - He was in West Quincee, Missouri

632
00:20:40,800 --> 00:20:44,080
 when there was a great flood of the Mississippi in 1993.

633
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:46,200
 So there was flooding happening all over the place

634
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:48,160
 and they'd put lots of sandbags in

635
00:20:48,160 --> 00:20:51,360
 and levees or levees or how he pronounced that.

636
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:55,360
 Anyway, he decided that he was going to remove

637
00:20:55,360 --> 00:21:00,000
 some of the sandbags and basically allow an area to flood.

638
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,720
 And it was very, no one died, but it's very dangerous.

639
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:04,880
 And also, you know, lots of people lost land

640
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:06,160
 and stuff like that.

641
00:21:06,160 --> 00:21:09,120
 He claimed that he did it because his town was in trouble

642
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:12,520
 and he wanted to move the sandbags from one place to another

643
00:21:12,520 --> 00:21:16,440
 to try and, you know, keep his town safe.

644
00:21:16,440 --> 00:21:18,600
 But then apparently he told his friend

645
00:21:18,600 --> 00:21:19,840
 that he'd actually done it

646
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:22,080
 so that he could strand his wife on the other side

647
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:25,680
 of the river so that he could have an affair.

648
00:21:25,680 --> 00:21:26,720
 - So he could have an affair?

649
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:27,560
 - Yeah.

650
00:21:27,560 --> 00:21:29,160
 - How long was he trying to strand her for?

651
00:21:29,160 --> 00:21:32,040
 - Well, a few weeks, he was hoping that it might happen.

652
00:21:32,040 --> 00:21:33,320
 Yeah. - Climacy.

653
00:21:33,320 --> 00:21:35,120
 - He maintains his innocence, I should say.

654
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:37,400
 He's in prison, I found him guilty.

655
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:39,880
 He's eligible for parole in 2023.

656
00:21:39,880 --> 00:21:43,600
 - And that's for the sandbag moving, not for the affair?

657
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:46,880
 - Yes, I don't think it's illegal to have an affair.

658
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:48,440
 - A very puritanical.

659
00:21:48,440 --> 00:21:51,000
 - No, because all the damage that it caused.

660
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:51,840
 - Yeah, of course.

661
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:53,960
 - It was billions of dollars of damage.

662
00:21:53,960 --> 00:21:54,800
 - What?

663
00:21:54,800 --> 00:21:56,080
 - One figure I read was 15 billion.

664
00:21:56,080 --> 00:21:57,600
 - How many sandbags did he move?

665
00:21:57,600 --> 00:21:58,960
 - Well, you only need--

666
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:01,280
 - You only need to remove one finger from the dam

667
00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:03,440
 and then everything goes. - Yeah, that's true.

668
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:04,640
 And you've got to be needing those fingers

669
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:07,200
 when you're conducting your illicit extramarital affair.

670
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:09,120
 (laughing)

671
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:11,240
 - There are easier ways to have affairs, aren't there?

672
00:22:11,240 --> 00:22:12,640
 - It feels like-- - Ken Dark?

673
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:13,480
 - Get a hedge.

674
00:22:13,480 --> 00:22:14,320
 - Why not?

675
00:22:14,320 --> 00:22:16,560
 (laughing)

676
00:22:16,560 --> 00:22:19,140
 (upbeat music)

677
00:22:19,140 --> 00:22:25,800
 - Okay, it is time for fact number three and that is James.

678
00:22:25,800 --> 00:22:28,560
 - Okay, my fact this week is that one of the few historians

679
00:22:28,560 --> 00:22:32,240
 to use the term Dark Ages is Professor Ken Dark.

680
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:33,960
 (laughing)

681
00:22:33,960 --> 00:22:34,800
 - It's funny.

682
00:22:34,800 --> 00:22:36,920
 - It's funny having a professor called Ken.

683
00:22:36,920 --> 00:22:38,040
 (laughing)

684
00:22:38,040 --> 00:22:39,240
 - I think that's funny enough.

685
00:22:39,240 --> 00:22:40,080
 - Why?

686
00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:41,080
 - What?

687
00:22:41,080 --> 00:22:42,400
 - My name's Ken Dark.

688
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:43,680
 (laughing)

689
00:22:43,680 --> 00:22:47,160
 - Because Ken in Scots, Old Scots means knowledge,

690
00:22:47,160 --> 00:22:49,720
 like you're Ken, and so, and he's a professor.

691
00:22:49,720 --> 00:22:51,400
 So is that why you found funny about that?

692
00:22:51,400 --> 00:22:52,880
 - God, it does mean knowledge you're right.

693
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:54,920
 And it makes me think that Ken of Barbie and Ken

694
00:22:54,920 --> 00:22:59,040
 has sunk a long way, hasn't he, since the Ken's view.

695
00:22:59,040 --> 00:23:00,680
 - Are they called the Dark Ages?

696
00:23:00,680 --> 00:23:01,520
 - After Ken.

697
00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:02,360
 - After Ken Dark.

698
00:23:02,360 --> 00:23:03,200
 - Or they're not.

699
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:04,640
 - Should've called it the Ken Ages.

700
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:05,480
 - This is just--

701
00:23:05,480 --> 00:23:06,520
 (laughing)

702
00:23:06,520 --> 00:23:07,360
 - Not Ken Ages.

703
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:08,200
 - Ken Ages ago.

704
00:23:08,200 --> 00:23:10,440
 (laughing)

705
00:23:10,440 --> 00:23:12,840
 - Very good.

706
00:23:12,840 --> 00:23:16,480
 This is just a complete coincidence, really, I think.

707
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:18,320
 So it's an article that I read on the website

708
00:23:18,320 --> 00:23:20,280
 of the University of Sheffield,

709
00:23:20,280 --> 00:23:22,440
 and it's about English heritage.

710
00:23:22,440 --> 00:23:26,600
 So they decided to do a handbook and some websites,

711
00:23:26,600 --> 00:23:28,640
 stuff like that, where they called the period

712
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:32,440
 between 400 AD and 1066, the Dark Ages.

713
00:23:32,440 --> 00:23:34,960
 And then there was a huge sort of campaign

714
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:37,520
 of a lot of Twitter historians saying,

715
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:39,560
 and other historians, but saying,

716
00:23:39,560 --> 00:23:41,320
 you can't call it the Dark Ages.

717
00:23:41,320 --> 00:23:44,680
 What it does is it makes people think it's a terrible time

718
00:23:44,680 --> 00:23:47,680
 where people had an awful life and stuff like that.

719
00:23:47,680 --> 00:23:51,000
 And it was, that's not really what Dark Ages means,

720
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:53,240
 but anyway, English heritage said that the reason

721
00:23:53,240 --> 00:23:55,240
 that we're calling it that is because there is

722
00:23:55,240 --> 00:23:57,480
 this professor called Professor Ken Dark,

723
00:23:57,480 --> 00:23:59,000
 and he calls it the Dark Ages.

724
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:01,400
 He's a proper professor, so we should be able

725
00:24:01,400 --> 00:24:03,200
 to call it that as well.

726
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:06,120
 A lot of people pointed out that the article

727
00:24:06,120 --> 00:24:09,520
 that Ken Dark wrote was slightly esoteric.

728
00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:11,800
 It was about the Byzantine era.

729
00:24:11,800 --> 00:24:13,720
 It wasn't about the British Dark Ages,

730
00:24:13,720 --> 00:24:15,440
 early modern period.

731
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:16,880
 If you look at Ken Dark's work,

732
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:19,320
 which I have done quite a lot,

733
00:24:19,320 --> 00:24:21,840
 you'll find that he's done something recently

734
00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:24,320
 where he talks about illuminating the Dark Ages

735
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:26,300
 and trying to bring light into the Dark Ages.

736
00:24:26,300 --> 00:24:29,080
 And he's not calling them the Dark Ages

737
00:24:29,080 --> 00:24:30,400
 'cause his name is Ken Dark.

738
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:31,520
 I just wanna make that really true.

739
00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:32,960
 - That's what you want do you think?

740
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:34,280
 (laughing)

741
00:24:34,280 --> 00:24:36,520
 - There's an argument that they basically just

742
00:24:36,520 --> 00:24:38,920
 wanted to kind of shut down the argument

743
00:24:38,920 --> 00:24:42,480
 and say, "Here's some evidence, this is why we did it."

744
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:44,360
 - And yet, if you asked any of those historians,

745
00:24:44,360 --> 00:24:48,800
 would you like to go and live in 430 AD forever?

746
00:24:48,800 --> 00:24:51,720
 You can't come back, it's not a cool history trip.

747
00:24:51,720 --> 00:24:53,600
 - Well, you can take your family.

748
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:55,240
 - You can take your family.

749
00:24:55,240 --> 00:24:56,700
 - Well, for instance, there's one historian

750
00:24:56,700 --> 00:24:57,980
 called Charles West who said,

751
00:24:57,980 --> 00:25:00,820
 "If the term Dark Ages really must be used,

752
00:25:00,820 --> 00:25:03,100
 it should at least be reserved for periods

753
00:25:03,100 --> 00:25:05,540
 of true in-humanity and barbarity,

754
00:25:05,540 --> 00:25:07,260
 such as the 20th century."

755
00:25:07,260 --> 00:25:09,620
 - Oh, wow. - Oh, wow.

756
00:25:09,620 --> 00:25:11,660
 - I do think we've got very snowflakey

757
00:25:11,660 --> 00:25:12,720
 about the Dark Ages.

758
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:14,940
 Come on, it's the one group of people

759
00:25:14,940 --> 00:25:18,100
 that we can still offend and they can never complain.

760
00:25:18,100 --> 00:25:20,180
 All right, it's people in history.

761
00:25:20,180 --> 00:25:22,140
 They can't do anything about it.

762
00:25:22,140 --> 00:25:23,580
 Just let's call them all ignorant.

763
00:25:23,580 --> 00:25:24,940
 Who cares, they're not coming back.

764
00:25:24,940 --> 00:25:27,620
 - Well, I think the point is that the word dark

765
00:25:27,620 --> 00:25:29,280
 is not supposed to be ignorant, right?

766
00:25:29,280 --> 00:25:31,120
 It's not supposed to be barbarian.

767
00:25:31,120 --> 00:25:33,100
 It's supposed to be a time

768
00:25:33,100 --> 00:25:36,020
 where we did not have much information about it.

769
00:25:36,020 --> 00:25:37,520
 And that's what it was originally,

770
00:25:37,520 --> 00:25:40,800
 but people have in the past like popular historians

771
00:25:40,800 --> 00:25:43,480
 of kind of in the 70s and 80s have said

772
00:25:43,480 --> 00:25:46,900
 that the Dark Ages was a time of darkness and difficulty.

773
00:25:46,900 --> 00:25:49,200
 - But I think they have, it has also been used

774
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:52,920
 since the concept kind of arose of the Dark Ages

775
00:25:52,920 --> 00:25:54,240
 to be denigrating.

776
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:56,300
 And there has always been this idea

777
00:25:56,300 --> 00:25:59,360
 that it's also very uncultured time.

778
00:25:59,360 --> 00:26:00,940
 - After the Romans.

779
00:26:00,940 --> 00:26:03,100
 - After the Romans, before the Renaissance.

780
00:26:03,100 --> 00:26:04,340
 - Before the Normans.

781
00:26:04,340 --> 00:26:06,400
 - They were doing bugger all then.

782
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:08,700
 - It was Francesco Petraca, right?

783
00:26:08,700 --> 00:26:10,200
 - Petraca, yeah.

784
00:26:10,200 --> 00:26:11,040
 - Yeah, sorry.

785
00:26:11,040 --> 00:26:12,900
 - No, you're just giving him his proper fancy name.

786
00:26:12,900 --> 00:26:14,220
 - His proper fancy name, yeah.

787
00:26:14,220 --> 00:26:15,060
 - Petraca.

788
00:26:15,060 --> 00:26:16,400
 - And yeah, basically complaining

789
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:17,520
 that there were no good books to read,

790
00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:18,480
 which I find amazing.

791
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:19,800
 'Cause then it did as you say, it evolved.

792
00:26:19,800 --> 00:26:21,840
 - Petraca was just a guy, right?

793
00:26:21,840 --> 00:26:22,680
 - Yeah, just a guy.

794
00:26:22,680 --> 00:26:23,520
 (laughing)

795
00:26:23,520 --> 00:26:24,920
 - No, he's an Italian scholar.

796
00:26:24,920 --> 00:26:27,120
 I mean, he was big in the 14th century.

797
00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:28,320
 - Great poet.

798
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:29,800
 - Yeah, I haven't read it, but.

799
00:26:29,800 --> 00:26:31,160
 - He wrote more than one.

800
00:26:31,160 --> 00:26:32,000
 - Get out.

801
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:34,280
 - He was the official poet of the timer.

802
00:26:34,280 --> 00:26:36,520
 (laughing)

803
00:26:36,520 --> 00:26:39,760
 - But it does, as you say, sort of mean like,

804
00:26:39,760 --> 00:26:41,880
 it was when science was being brushed away

805
00:26:41,880 --> 00:26:43,080
 and religion was coming in.

806
00:26:43,080 --> 00:26:43,920
 - Yeah.

807
00:26:43,920 --> 00:26:46,840
 - And as a result, it was a Dark Age for the mind.

808
00:26:46,840 --> 00:26:47,800
 - Yeah. - Yeah.

809
00:26:47,800 --> 00:26:49,240
 - As well as there being no records.

810
00:26:49,240 --> 00:26:50,880
 That's, it's been, yeah.

811
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:52,560
 - And let's be honest.

812
00:26:52,560 --> 00:26:54,720
 - I'm full records of what was going on.

813
00:26:54,720 --> 00:26:55,560
 - Exactly, I know.

814
00:26:55,560 --> 00:26:57,160
 - Between 400 and 1056. - I completely agree.

815
00:26:57,160 --> 00:26:58,000
 I agree with you.

816
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:00,400
 - There were other names given to the,

817
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:01,240
 what are we calling them?

818
00:27:01,240 --> 00:27:02,840
 - Early Middle Ages. - Early Middle Ages, yeah.

819
00:27:02,840 --> 00:27:04,920
 - That were published in various books.

820
00:27:04,920 --> 00:27:07,280
 So they included the Barbarous Ages,

821
00:27:07,280 --> 00:27:09,320
 sounds pretty, you know.

822
00:27:09,320 --> 00:27:11,280
 The Obscure Ages, which I quite like.

823
00:27:11,280 --> 00:27:12,360
 (laughing)

824
00:27:12,360 --> 00:27:13,400
 Makes me sound quite cool.

825
00:27:13,400 --> 00:27:16,600
 The Monkish Ages, absolutely no argument with that.

826
00:27:16,600 --> 00:27:18,720
 The Muddy Ages, those were all various.

827
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:19,560
 - Really?

828
00:27:19,560 --> 00:27:21,760
 - And then the Mississippi is known as the Old Muddy,

829
00:27:21,760 --> 00:27:22,600
 isn't it?

830
00:27:22,600 --> 00:27:23,440
 - Is it? - I think.

831
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:24,280
 - Yeah.

832
00:27:24,280 --> 00:27:25,120
 - This would have been, yeah.

833
00:27:25,120 --> 00:27:26,400
 - Or the Big Muddy, I think maybe.

834
00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:27,320
 - The Big Muddy.

835
00:27:27,320 --> 00:27:28,800
 - No relation to the Muddy Ages.

836
00:27:28,800 --> 00:27:29,640
 (laughing)

837
00:27:29,640 --> 00:27:30,880
 - I don't think so.

838
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:34,960
 - Also the Dark Ages could be used to describe the period

839
00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:38,760
 from 1100 BC to 750 BC,

840
00:27:38,760 --> 00:27:40,960
 which was between the collapse of the Bronze Age

841
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:42,240
 civilization in Greece

842
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:44,680
 and the beginning of the Archaic Age in Greece.

843
00:27:44,680 --> 00:27:46,400
 - Oh yeah, the Greek Dark Ages.

844
00:27:46,400 --> 00:27:48,920
 - Or it could be from the start of the universe

845
00:27:48,920 --> 00:27:51,080
 until 13.2 billion years ago,

846
00:27:51,080 --> 00:27:52,960
 which was between the start of the universe

847
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:54,360
 and the creation of the first stars.

848
00:27:54,360 --> 00:27:56,320
 That's called the Dark Ages as well, so.

849
00:27:56,320 --> 00:27:57,920
 - Oh, but people get offended, don't they?

850
00:27:57,920 --> 00:28:00,160
 Those little lumps of dust in the air.

851
00:28:00,160 --> 00:28:02,520
 Get offended now, if we call them the Dark Ages.

852
00:28:02,520 --> 00:28:04,800
 - I just don't see that the little bits of dust

853
00:28:04,800 --> 00:28:06,720
 in the air are gonna be able to come back

854
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:07,960
 and get offended.

855
00:28:07,960 --> 00:28:08,800
 I just don't see it.

856
00:28:08,800 --> 00:28:11,040
 - You guys are not taking into the account

857
00:28:11,040 --> 00:28:14,320
 that time travel will happen one day.

858
00:28:14,320 --> 00:28:15,400
 - And that bit for a bit of dust

859
00:28:15,400 --> 00:28:16,520
 will jump down my throats.

860
00:28:16,520 --> 00:28:17,680
 - Exactly.

861
00:28:17,680 --> 00:28:20,400
 I read in one book, this is a book called "Europa History",

862
00:28:20,400 --> 00:28:22,840
 that the Middle Ages originally meant the time

863
00:28:22,840 --> 00:28:24,720
 between the first coming of Jesus

864
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:26,560
 and the second coming of Jesus.

865
00:28:26,560 --> 00:28:28,840
 And since the second coming hasn't as far as we know

866
00:28:28,840 --> 00:28:31,720
 happened, we're still technically in the Middle Ages now.

867
00:28:31,720 --> 00:28:32,680
 - That's very exciting.

868
00:28:32,680 --> 00:28:33,520
 - That's cool.

869
00:28:33,520 --> 00:28:35,520
 - Yeah, and thank God, 'cause I always get really anxious

870
00:28:35,520 --> 00:28:36,680
 that we're in the modern time

871
00:28:36,680 --> 00:28:38,240
 and there's nowhere to go after modern.

872
00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:40,160
 So that's good to know that we're actually still in the middle.

873
00:28:40,160 --> 00:28:42,120
 - So if anyone says that I'm middle-aged,

874
00:28:42,120 --> 00:28:44,240
 I could say yes, well, technically I'm middle-aged

875
00:28:44,240 --> 00:28:46,040
 because the second coming of Christ hasn't happened.

876
00:28:46,040 --> 00:28:46,880
 - But so are you.

877
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:47,840
 (laughing)

878
00:28:47,840 --> 00:28:48,920
 - We're all like, yeah.

879
00:28:48,920 --> 00:28:50,560
 - One thing that the Dark Ages,

880
00:28:50,560 --> 00:28:52,480
 doing the finger quotes there, gave us,

881
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:54,840
 which is quite exciting just in reference to literature,

882
00:28:54,840 --> 00:28:58,240
 was spaces in between words.

883
00:28:58,240 --> 00:29:01,320
 So every word, as we know, back in old literature,

884
00:29:01,320 --> 00:29:03,600
 used to be bunged together, no spaces,

885
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:05,360
 really hard to tell what's the next word.

886
00:29:05,360 --> 00:29:06,880
 And it was in that period.

887
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:09,480
 The monks started going, let's put a little,

888
00:29:09,480 --> 00:29:11,040
 we'll put a space in between those two words,

889
00:29:11,040 --> 00:29:11,880
 what do you reckon?

890
00:29:11,880 --> 00:29:13,280
 - So they didn't write books of their own,

891
00:29:13,280 --> 00:29:14,960
 but they did at least introduce some spaces

892
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:16,320
 into the books that already existed.

893
00:29:16,320 --> 00:29:18,160
 - Yeah, it's funny 'cause these days,

894
00:29:18,160 --> 00:29:19,720
 you know, books have word counts, don't they?

895
00:29:19,720 --> 00:29:21,800
 You're like, oh, this book is 100,000 words.

896
00:29:21,800 --> 00:29:22,880
 Whereas I guess in those days,

897
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:24,080
 we're like, how long is your manuscript?

898
00:29:24,080 --> 00:29:26,360
 Well, it's one word, like all the other,

899
00:29:26,360 --> 00:29:27,640
 all the other books.

900
00:29:27,640 --> 00:29:32,520
 Yeah, what a word, one very specific word.

901
00:29:32,520 --> 00:29:35,280
 - So word with you, oh, God, here we go.

902
00:29:35,280 --> 00:29:39,040
 - The Greek Dark Ages, I love the Greek Dark Ages.

903
00:29:39,040 --> 00:29:40,040
 - Are they called the Greek Ages,

904
00:29:40,040 --> 00:29:42,040
 is that contentious as well?

905
00:29:42,040 --> 00:29:43,120
 - Oh, probably.

906
00:29:43,120 --> 00:29:44,840
 - Who gives us stuff?

907
00:29:44,840 --> 00:29:47,840
 I'm signing up with T-Matter on this one, I've got it.

908
00:29:47,840 --> 00:29:49,840
 - Oh God, I feel like I'm in bad company now.

909
00:29:49,840 --> 00:29:52,720
 So they're such a mystery.

910
00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:54,440
 They are, as James was saying,

911
00:29:54,440 --> 00:29:56,880
 this period at the end of the Bronze Age.

912
00:29:56,880 --> 00:29:59,320
 And, but they, what I always loved about them

913
00:29:59,320 --> 00:30:01,640
 is that they happened because of the invasion

914
00:30:01,640 --> 00:30:04,600
 of the sea peoples, do you know about this?

915
00:30:04,600 --> 00:30:08,280
 And you will love the sea peoples down there, so great.

916
00:30:08,280 --> 00:30:10,960
 I actually can't believe that we haven't discussed them before.

917
00:30:10,960 --> 00:30:14,320
 - This is the class eight talk that I listened to.

918
00:30:14,320 --> 00:30:15,560
 - There we go.

919
00:30:15,560 --> 00:30:17,600
 - Basically, they're a group of people.

920
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:18,680
 We don't know if they existed,

921
00:30:18,680 --> 00:30:19,960
 but they're currently historians,

922
00:30:19,960 --> 00:30:23,560
 best explanation for why in, what was it, 1100 BC.

923
00:30:23,560 --> 00:30:24,880
 Civilization just collapsed.

924
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:28,240
 So we had this amazing, like big palace based states,

925
00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:29,880
 Mycenaeque empire.

926
00:30:29,880 --> 00:30:32,600
 - Minoans, they ever? - Exactly.

927
00:30:32,600 --> 00:30:34,440
 And then it all just vanished.

928
00:30:34,440 --> 00:30:37,800
 And also ancient Egypt as well, vanished overnight

929
00:30:37,800 --> 00:30:40,400
 and didn't come back until the Greeks worked out

930
00:30:40,400 --> 00:30:42,840
 to write an alphabet and stuff 400 years later,

931
00:30:42,840 --> 00:30:44,200
 got back on their feet.

932
00:30:44,200 --> 00:30:46,160
 And historians think it's 'cause there was someone

933
00:30:46,160 --> 00:30:49,040
 called the sea peoples waltzing around the Mediterranean,

934
00:30:49,040 --> 00:30:51,480
 strange beings who weren't invaded.

935
00:30:51,480 --> 00:30:52,520
 - Go on.

936
00:30:52,520 --> 00:30:55,440
 - So, okay, are they, were they of the sea

937
00:30:55,440 --> 00:30:57,280
 or were they just living on boats?

938
00:30:57,280 --> 00:30:58,920
 - Well, it's not.

939
00:30:58,920 --> 00:31:00,320
 - I mean, were they made of water?

940
00:31:00,320 --> 00:31:02,800
 - Sorry, what is the difference in your mind, Dan,

941
00:31:02,800 --> 00:31:04,840
 between being of the sea and living on a boat?

942
00:31:04,840 --> 00:31:08,800
 - Were they like Aquaman or were they a pirate on a boat?

943
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:10,840
 - The more serious historians, I think,

944
00:31:10,840 --> 00:31:14,520
 is count the Merman, Merman-made explanation of sea peoples

945
00:31:14,520 --> 00:31:15,960
 and say they're probably just boating.

946
00:31:15,960 --> 00:31:17,640
 - What does Ken Dark say about that?

947
00:31:17,640 --> 00:31:19,200
 That's what I want to know.

948
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:22,760
 - They obviously, the Dark Ages,

949
00:31:22,760 --> 00:31:25,600
 that aren't called the Dark Ages, were whole of Europe.

950
00:31:25,600 --> 00:31:28,040
 And it was partly this whole mini kingdoms thing,

951
00:31:28,040 --> 00:31:31,040
 everyone and his dog can be a king that defined them

952
00:31:31,040 --> 00:31:34,640
 because it was all so splintered and it was the Goths

953
00:31:34,640 --> 00:31:36,000
 and the Visigoths and the Ostrogoths

954
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:38,760
 and the Norogoths and the Demigoths and stuff,

955
00:31:38,760 --> 00:31:40,160
 who were all fighting each other,

956
00:31:40,160 --> 00:31:42,160
 weren't they, for hundreds of years?

957
00:31:42,160 --> 00:31:44,040
 And the Vandals and the Allons,

958
00:31:44,040 --> 00:31:45,800
 which I think we've mentioned before.

959
00:31:45,800 --> 00:31:47,960
 The Allons tribe, who I didn't realize,

960
00:31:47,960 --> 00:31:49,560
 brought us Great Danes.

961
00:31:49,560 --> 00:31:51,600
 So that's something else the Dark Ages gave us.

962
00:31:51,600 --> 00:31:54,360
 The Allons, who were Iranian, were known for their--

963
00:31:54,360 --> 00:31:56,280
 - Well, it said the Great Danes aren't Danish.

964
00:31:56,280 --> 00:31:58,920
 - I think they must have taken root via Denmark

965
00:31:58,920 --> 00:32:00,240
 before they got there.

966
00:32:00,240 --> 00:32:01,760
 Before they evolved into what they are today.

967
00:32:01,760 --> 00:32:05,320
 They brought the fighting dogs that led to Great Danes.

968
00:32:05,320 --> 00:32:08,280
 But then the person who saw, I would say,

969
00:32:08,280 --> 00:32:11,400
 who kind of presaged the end of this non-Dark Ages,

970
00:32:11,400 --> 00:32:14,960
 Dark Ages, was probably Charlemagne, do we think?

971
00:32:14,960 --> 00:32:16,920
 As in he just unified Europe.

972
00:32:16,920 --> 00:32:18,840
 So he did that, it was a big deal.

973
00:32:18,840 --> 00:32:21,320
 And you know how he was crowned emperor?

974
00:32:21,320 --> 00:32:23,040
 - How, like, the ceremony or how we can't be--

975
00:32:23,040 --> 00:32:24,240
 - Yeah, yeah, the ceremony.

976
00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:26,600
 - No, oh, is he one of those strange people

977
00:32:26,600 --> 00:32:27,880
 who crowned themself?

978
00:32:27,880 --> 00:32:30,360
 - No, quite the opposite, apparently.

979
00:32:30,360 --> 00:32:32,160
 - It was crowned by someone else.

980
00:32:32,160 --> 00:32:34,600
 - There you go, at the end.

981
00:32:34,600 --> 00:32:37,360
 And in fact, he was crowned again as to his will,

982
00:32:37,360 --> 00:32:38,600
 according to the court scribe,

983
00:32:38,600 --> 00:32:40,280
 who might have been trying to make him sound really humble.

984
00:32:40,280 --> 00:32:41,240
 - So he was running away

985
00:32:41,240 --> 00:32:43,240
 while someone was chasing him with a crown.

986
00:32:43,240 --> 00:32:44,640
 - Exactly.

987
00:32:44,640 --> 00:32:48,360
 800 AD, Christmas Day, he'd gone to Rome,

988
00:32:48,360 --> 00:32:50,800
 and the Pope decided he's gonna crown him emperor

989
00:32:50,800 --> 00:32:53,360
 of this whole bunch of Western Europe.

990
00:32:53,360 --> 00:32:55,160
 And he sneaks up behind Charlemagne

991
00:32:55,160 --> 00:32:56,640
 while Charlemagne's praying

992
00:32:56,640 --> 00:32:58,440
 and pops a crown on his head.

993
00:32:58,440 --> 00:32:59,960
 And apparently Charlemagne just stood up and went,

994
00:32:59,960 --> 00:33:02,480
 "Oh my gosh, no, what, me?"

995
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:05,200
 I couldn't, I couldn't possibly.

996
00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:06,560
 And then he became, you know, the greatest--

997
00:33:06,560 --> 00:33:07,720
 - It's a good story, isn't it?

998
00:33:07,720 --> 00:33:08,560
 - It's a good story.

999
00:33:08,560 --> 00:33:09,880
 - 'Cause like one of them's praying,

1000
00:33:09,880 --> 00:33:12,520
 so he's holy, and he didn't really want it.

1001
00:33:12,520 --> 00:33:13,520
 Well, actually probably happened.

1002
00:33:13,520 --> 00:33:15,840
 They both got really pissed one night.

1003
00:33:15,840 --> 00:33:16,840
 - Was it Charlemagne

1004
00:33:16,840 --> 00:33:19,480
 who supposedly had the asbestos tablecloth?

1005
00:33:19,480 --> 00:33:20,800
 - Oh yeah, that is him.

1006
00:33:20,800 --> 00:33:21,960
 Yeah, yeah, I think so.

1007
00:33:21,960 --> 00:33:24,360
 - That was sort of like his dinner party trick, wasn't it?

1008
00:33:24,360 --> 00:33:25,880
 He would--

1009
00:33:25,880 --> 00:33:27,320
 - He would throw it into a fire

1010
00:33:27,320 --> 00:33:28,720
 so you wouldn't have to clean it

1011
00:33:28,720 --> 00:33:30,360
 because asbestos doesn't burn.

1012
00:33:30,360 --> 00:33:31,600
 So you put it in the fire,

1013
00:33:31,600 --> 00:33:33,280
 it would kind of sterilize,

1014
00:33:33,280 --> 00:33:34,120
 and then you pull it out again

1015
00:33:34,120 --> 00:33:35,760
 and you could use it again.

1016
00:33:35,760 --> 00:33:38,160
 - This was, of course, before they knew about mesothelioma,

1017
00:33:38,160 --> 00:33:39,080
 the terrible lung disease

1018
00:33:39,080 --> 00:33:40,640
 that they presumably all got back then.

1019
00:33:40,640 --> 00:33:44,360
 - I think you only get that from little shards of asbestos.

1020
00:33:44,360 --> 00:33:46,080
 If you have a full tablecloth, you'll be fine.

1021
00:33:46,080 --> 00:33:46,920
 - You're all right.

1022
00:33:46,920 --> 00:33:49,280
 - But if bits come off it, then you would help them.

1023
00:33:49,280 --> 00:33:51,160
 I mean, I'm sure no one was living long enough

1024
00:33:51,160 --> 00:33:53,440
 to worry about the long-term effects

1025
00:33:53,440 --> 00:33:54,520
 of an asbestos table,

1026
00:33:54,520 --> 00:33:57,800
 like there were more pressing health concerns than the age.

1027
00:33:57,800 --> 00:33:59,800
 So they cleared the table.

1028
00:33:59,800 --> 00:34:00,640
 - I don't know if, yes,

1029
00:34:00,640 --> 00:34:01,600
 I don't know if he did that trick

1030
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:02,960
 where everything stayed underneath,

1031
00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:05,040
 but even a kind of swipe.

1032
00:34:05,040 --> 00:34:06,440
 - You haven't done that trick, by the way.

1033
00:34:06,440 --> 00:34:07,440
 - No, I've tried it once.

1034
00:34:07,440 --> 00:34:08,280
 - It's hard.

1035
00:34:08,280 --> 00:34:09,600
 It is harder than you think.

1036
00:34:09,600 --> 00:34:10,600
 - It does actually work.

1037
00:34:10,600 --> 00:34:11,960
 - I think I've seen you do it.

1038
00:34:11,960 --> 00:34:13,720
 - Yeah, well, I used to be a waiter

1039
00:34:13,720 --> 00:34:15,480
 and I used to try it a lot.

1040
00:34:15,480 --> 00:34:17,600
 And like most of the time you can't really do it.

1041
00:34:17,600 --> 00:34:19,400
 And so there's a trick to it, but yeah.

1042
00:34:19,400 --> 00:34:20,480
 - You were the most fired waiter

1043
00:34:20,480 --> 00:34:22,280
 in the North of England, though, I love you.

1044
00:34:22,280 --> 00:34:23,520
 (laughing)

1045
00:34:23,520 --> 00:34:26,100
 (upbeat music)

1046
00:34:26,100 --> 00:34:30,680
 - Okay, it is time for our final fact of the show.

1047
00:34:30,680 --> 00:34:31,980
 And that is my fact.

1048
00:34:31,980 --> 00:34:34,720
 My fact this week is that the metal used

1049
00:34:34,720 --> 00:34:39,200
 to make Grammy Award trophies is called Grammium.

1050
00:34:39,200 --> 00:34:40,040
 (laughing)

1051
00:34:40,040 --> 00:34:40,860
 - Amazing.

1052
00:34:40,860 --> 00:34:41,700
 - What a coincidence.

1053
00:34:41,700 --> 00:34:42,720
 (laughing)

1054
00:34:42,720 --> 00:34:46,440
 - Well, this is a trademarked metal alloy, a zinc alloy,

1055
00:34:46,440 --> 00:34:49,800
 that a guy called John Billings has patented.

1056
00:34:49,800 --> 00:34:53,000
 And he is the guy who makes the Grammy Awards.

1057
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:55,280
 And he's made them for decades now.

1058
00:34:55,280 --> 00:34:58,880
 And what I didn't realize was it's a little team

1059
00:34:58,880 --> 00:35:01,560
 that assembles every year the Grammys.

1060
00:35:01,560 --> 00:35:05,160
 And it's basically a one shop operation

1061
00:35:05,160 --> 00:35:07,760
 where not only do they make these Grammys,

1062
00:35:07,760 --> 00:35:09,480
 but then they put them in a van

1063
00:35:09,480 --> 00:35:12,680
 and they drive 2,000 or something miles across the country

1064
00:35:12,680 --> 00:35:14,920
 to deliver it personally.

1065
00:35:14,920 --> 00:35:16,840
 John Billings himself would be sitting

1066
00:35:16,840 --> 00:35:18,080
 in the car doing this.

1067
00:35:18,080 --> 00:35:20,720
 And he is the Grammy man.

1068
00:35:20,720 --> 00:35:22,040
 And it's-

1069
00:35:22,040 --> 00:35:24,440
 - They use a strip map to get there.

1070
00:35:24,440 --> 00:35:25,760
 So exciting.

1071
00:35:25,760 --> 00:35:27,360
 One year they went off course, it was a disaster,

1072
00:35:27,360 --> 00:35:28,560
 there were no Grammys.

1073
00:35:29,440 --> 00:35:30,600
 - Yeah. And it's, yeah.

1074
00:35:30,600 --> 00:35:33,440
 So this guy, he joined when he was quite young.

1075
00:35:33,440 --> 00:35:35,540
 There was a previous person making the Grammys.

1076
00:35:35,540 --> 00:35:36,740
 And since he took over,

1077
00:35:36,740 --> 00:35:39,040
 he changed the design of the Grammys,

1078
00:35:39,040 --> 00:35:40,360
 which is what they are today.

1079
00:35:40,360 --> 00:35:44,960
 And he also came up with this new, stronger alloy

1080
00:35:44,960 --> 00:35:46,640
 because all of the other previous Grammys

1081
00:35:46,640 --> 00:35:48,320
 were quite flimsy and would break.

1082
00:35:48,320 --> 00:35:50,120
 And he thought this needs to be, you know-

1083
00:35:50,120 --> 00:35:51,080
 - Did they actually break?

1084
00:35:51,080 --> 00:35:52,280
 Did people take Grammys home

1085
00:35:52,280 --> 00:35:54,160
 and then you put them down and it just comes?

1086
00:35:54,160 --> 00:35:55,000
 - They still do, yeah.

1087
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:55,840
 - They still break.

1088
00:35:55,840 --> 00:35:56,680
 - But they broke a lot more easy.

1089
00:35:56,680 --> 00:35:58,200
 I think it was so the Grammys,

1090
00:35:58,200 --> 00:35:59,960
 if you don't know what they are,

1091
00:35:59,960 --> 00:36:03,120
 it is a Grammophone that is the shape of the trophy.

1092
00:36:03,120 --> 00:36:03,960
 And so obviously-

1093
00:36:03,960 --> 00:36:06,440
 - And I suppose it's a music award in America as the other.

1094
00:36:06,440 --> 00:36:07,280
 - Yeah, yeah.

1095
00:36:07,280 --> 00:36:09,000
 It's the biggest music award in America.

1096
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:12,800
 And the trophy is in the shape of a Grammophone.

1097
00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:15,440
 And it was particularly the arm that was with the stylus

1098
00:36:15,440 --> 00:36:16,960
 on the end that was particularly flimsy.

1099
00:36:16,960 --> 00:36:19,400
 And that was the bit when he redesigned it

1100
00:36:19,400 --> 00:36:20,920
 that he wanted to get stronger.

1101
00:36:20,920 --> 00:36:24,720
 - Adele, the singer once snapped part of her Grammy on stage.

1102
00:36:24,720 --> 00:36:27,240
 She dropped it on stage and broke part of it off.

1103
00:36:27,240 --> 00:36:31,200
 And in 2010, Taylor Swift was carrying four Grammys

1104
00:36:31,200 --> 00:36:34,440
 and she dropped one of them and it broke into pieces.

1105
00:36:34,440 --> 00:36:37,080
 And what happens is when it breaks into pieces,

1106
00:36:37,080 --> 00:36:39,840
 you send it back and they fix it for you.

1107
00:36:39,840 --> 00:36:41,920
 Mr. Billings fix it for you.

1108
00:36:41,920 --> 00:36:44,920
 But she wrote oops on the side of the one she broke

1109
00:36:44,920 --> 00:36:48,280
 and he now has that in his office on the side,

1110
00:36:48,280 --> 00:36:51,320
 a Taylor Swift broken Grammy and he gave her a new one.

1111
00:36:51,320 --> 00:36:52,280
 - That's great.

1112
00:36:52,280 --> 00:36:55,280
 I wonder if she broke the, so the Grammys that we see-

1113
00:36:55,280 --> 00:36:56,120
 - The stunt.

1114
00:36:56,120 --> 00:36:57,600
 - There are stunt Grammys.

1115
00:36:57,600 --> 00:36:59,800
 - And that's what he drives across the country as well.

1116
00:36:59,800 --> 00:37:01,840
 He drives the stunt ones across the country.

1117
00:37:01,840 --> 00:37:04,000
 That drives them back as well before and after each.

1118
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:05,280
 - Sorry, what is a stunt Grammy?

1119
00:37:05,280 --> 00:37:06,120
 - A stunt Grammy is the one-

1120
00:37:06,120 --> 00:37:07,360
 - It's one that can do amazing tricks.

1121
00:37:07,360 --> 00:37:10,400
 So it throws us other skyscrapers, tightrope walks.

1122
00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:12,720
 - So the idea is that the real Grammys

1123
00:37:12,720 --> 00:37:14,800
 are going to be given to everyone who's won them,

1124
00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:17,240
 need to have their name put on it and so on.

1125
00:37:17,240 --> 00:37:18,520
 And they can't do that on the night.

1126
00:37:18,520 --> 00:37:21,880
 So he drives the fake Grammys that you see them holding

1127
00:37:21,880 --> 00:37:23,880
 at the award ceremony and then they give them back

1128
00:37:23,880 --> 00:37:25,480
 and then the real Grammy.

1129
00:37:25,480 --> 00:37:27,040
 - So those are not real Grammys?

1130
00:37:27,040 --> 00:37:27,880
 - Well, they're obviously-

1131
00:37:27,880 --> 00:37:30,120
 - Well, they used every single year.

1132
00:37:30,120 --> 00:37:31,880
 The same ones are used every year.

1133
00:37:31,880 --> 00:37:33,920
 So if you get a Grammy next year, Andy,

1134
00:37:33,920 --> 00:37:35,320
 which I'm sure you're hoping for.

1135
00:37:35,320 --> 00:37:37,160
 - I'm trying.

1136
00:37:37,160 --> 00:37:39,760
 - You will get one that might have been had by Adele

1137
00:37:39,760 --> 00:37:42,320
 a few years ago or by Taylor Swift or whatever.

1138
00:37:42,320 --> 00:37:44,480
 'Cause when he gets the stunt Grammys home,

1139
00:37:44,480 --> 00:37:46,320
 he cleans them with washing up liquid

1140
00:37:46,320 --> 00:37:48,640
 to get rid of any fingerprints or anything like that.

1141
00:37:48,640 --> 00:37:50,360
 And then just puts them into storage.

1142
00:37:50,360 --> 00:37:52,560
 And then the next year he takes them back.

1143
00:37:52,560 --> 00:37:53,800
 - Nice.

1144
00:37:53,800 --> 00:37:56,720
 - So he just, every year drives a load of Grammys

1145
00:37:56,720 --> 00:37:58,320
 across America then drives them back the other way?

1146
00:37:58,320 --> 00:38:00,560
 - Yeah, you would think he would have a storage unit

1147
00:38:00,560 --> 00:38:01,680
 where he could just leave them.

1148
00:38:01,680 --> 00:38:03,080
 - Does seem like that would be sensible.

1149
00:38:03,080 --> 00:38:04,160
 - It would be in the fishin', wouldn't it?

1150
00:38:04,160 --> 00:38:05,440
 - Yeah.

1151
00:38:05,440 --> 00:38:08,080
 - And then what does he do with the actual one?

1152
00:38:08,080 --> 00:38:10,440
 Sorry, does he then post them out first class?

1153
00:38:10,440 --> 00:38:12,600
 - I think he might also drive those ones as well.

1154
00:38:12,600 --> 00:38:14,720
 - But then does he has to drive on every single home

1155
00:38:14,720 --> 00:38:16,040
 of every single Grammy winner?

1156
00:38:16,040 --> 00:38:18,320
 - No, I'm sure he takes them to Mr. Grammy

1157
00:38:18,320 --> 00:38:20,120
 who then hands them over to the people.

1158
00:38:20,120 --> 00:38:21,480
 - There's a distribution network, he thinks.

1159
00:38:21,480 --> 00:38:22,600
 - Yeah, yeah, I think so.

1160
00:38:22,600 --> 00:38:23,440
 - There will be someone--

1161
00:38:23,440 --> 00:38:25,080
 - There's a GDPR issue if he knows

1162
00:38:25,080 --> 00:38:26,640
 where all these people live as well.

1163
00:38:26,640 --> 00:38:28,920
 - That would be an amazing bit of information to have.

1164
00:38:28,920 --> 00:38:29,920
 Just all the addresses

1165
00:38:29,920 --> 00:38:31,680
 of all the most famous musicians in the world.

1166
00:38:31,680 --> 00:38:33,320
 - Yeah, so the Grammys.

1167
00:38:33,320 --> 00:38:36,880
 This is a thing that started in the late 1950s

1168
00:38:36,880 --> 00:38:40,800
 and the idea behind it was that they wanted to have

1169
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:44,280
 something that represented the output of musicians.

1170
00:38:44,280 --> 00:38:46,240
 It was called the Grammy because they had a competition

1171
00:38:46,240 --> 00:38:48,880
 where they asked the Americans what do you wanna call this?

1172
00:38:48,880 --> 00:38:50,640
 And I think it was a girl who wrote in

1173
00:38:50,640 --> 00:38:53,600
 and said these trophies are made out of Grammys,

1174
00:38:53,600 --> 00:38:55,360
 so why don't we call it Grammys?

1175
00:38:55,360 --> 00:38:57,600
 (laughing)

1176
00:38:57,600 --> 00:38:59,400
 - She was, she, a bunch of people suggested it,

1177
00:38:59,400 --> 00:39:01,240
 but she was the first person who's later got read

1178
00:39:01,240 --> 00:39:02,600
 with the suggestion of Grammy.

1179
00:39:02,600 --> 00:39:04,240
 - I think she was a New Orleans secretary

1180
00:39:04,240 --> 00:39:05,760
 called Rose Trey Elizabeth Danner.

1181
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:09,520
 And she was given 25 free LPs as a gift

1182
00:39:09,520 --> 00:39:11,040
 'cause lots of people are interested in Grammy

1183
00:39:11,040 --> 00:39:12,840
 but her letter was open first.

1184
00:39:12,840 --> 00:39:15,480
 But she lived until February, 2014.

1185
00:39:15,480 --> 00:39:19,480
 So she could have seen Robin Thickey performing Blurred Lines.

1186
00:39:19,480 --> 00:39:20,560
 (laughing)

1187
00:39:20,560 --> 00:39:22,400
 - Robin Thickey.

1188
00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:23,560
 - Yeah, I used to call him that.

1189
00:39:23,560 --> 00:39:26,800
 And I now, on principle, refuse to call him Robin

1190
00:39:26,800 --> 00:39:27,640
 by any other name.

1191
00:39:27,640 --> 00:39:30,080
 - I reckon if you were at school with Robin Thickey,

1192
00:39:30,080 --> 00:39:32,200
 that's what you would call him.

1193
00:39:32,200 --> 00:39:33,920
 - Oh, what a Thickey.

1194
00:39:33,920 --> 00:39:36,240
 - There have been some pretty tedious decisions

1195
00:39:36,240 --> 00:39:38,840
 from the Grammy board over the years, haven't there?

1196
00:39:38,840 --> 00:39:39,680
 - It feels like you've got a few of them.

1197
00:39:39,680 --> 00:39:40,520
 Just leave there, Anna.

1198
00:39:40,520 --> 00:39:42,960
 - Well, I was reading an article written in 1993.

1199
00:39:42,960 --> 00:39:45,200
 So some of these wrongs have been corrected now.

1200
00:39:45,200 --> 00:39:48,280
 But even so, a New York Times article written in 1993

1201
00:39:48,280 --> 00:39:51,800
 about how they just never seemed to pick the right people.

1202
00:39:51,800 --> 00:39:56,000
 So by 1993, here are people who hadn't won a Grammy.

1203
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:58,280
 Eric Clapton, The Beach Boys, The Supremes,

1204
00:39:58,280 --> 00:39:59,840
 The Grateful Dead, The Jackson Five,

1205
00:39:59,840 --> 00:40:03,240
 Led Zeppelin, Etta James, Queen, Van Morrison.

1206
00:40:03,240 --> 00:40:04,080
 - The Queen.

1207
00:40:04,080 --> 00:40:06,840
 - The Queen, the Queen has won the Grammys every year,

1208
00:40:06,840 --> 00:40:09,040
 of course, lovely voice.

1209
00:40:09,040 --> 00:40:10,360
 Jimi Hendrix and The Rolling Stones,

1210
00:40:10,360 --> 00:40:13,160
 the only Grammy they ever won was Lifetime Achievement.

1211
00:40:13,160 --> 00:40:15,080
 At that point, 'cause they sometimes do this thing

1212
00:40:15,080 --> 00:40:16,960
 where I think the judges think years afterwards,

1213
00:40:16,960 --> 00:40:18,760
 oh, shit, they did turn out to be really good.

1214
00:40:18,760 --> 00:40:19,600
 So then they toss a light.

1215
00:40:19,600 --> 00:40:20,440
 - Oh, God, let's have it.

1216
00:40:20,440 --> 00:40:21,280
 - We forgot that.

1217
00:40:21,280 --> 00:40:22,120
 (laughing)

1218
00:40:22,120 --> 00:40:23,480
 - Those were busy years, though.

1219
00:40:23,480 --> 00:40:25,480
 We're talking about, in terms of rock, you know,

1220
00:40:25,480 --> 00:40:27,120
 Hendrix would have been up against the Beatles,

1221
00:40:27,120 --> 00:40:29,000
 up against, that was a crowd.

1222
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:30,160
 - They didn't like rock, though.

1223
00:40:30,160 --> 00:40:31,960
 That was always a thing with the Grammys.

1224
00:40:31,960 --> 00:40:34,480
 They were almost set up as an antidote

1225
00:40:34,480 --> 00:40:36,240
 to what they considered was, I think,

1226
00:40:36,240 --> 00:40:38,680
 was called anti-music by the people

1227
00:40:38,680 --> 00:40:40,840
 who wanted the Grammys to come about.

1228
00:40:40,840 --> 00:40:42,200
 They wanted to celebrate quality music,

1229
00:40:42,200 --> 00:40:44,840
 not anti-music like R&B and rock,

1230
00:40:44,840 --> 00:40:47,600
 which, it was like, this is a flash in the pan.

1231
00:40:47,600 --> 00:40:50,560
 - The most Grammys is by George Salty.

1232
00:40:50,560 --> 00:40:51,400
 - George Salty?

1233
00:40:51,400 --> 00:40:54,720
 - And Salty's ring, actually, has been twice voted

1234
00:40:54,720 --> 00:40:57,000
 the greatest recording ever made.

1235
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:57,840
 - What?

1236
00:40:57,840 --> 00:40:58,680
 - I don't know if you know Salty's ring.

1237
00:40:58,680 --> 00:40:59,520
 - No.

1238
00:40:59,520 --> 00:41:00,360
 - No?

1239
00:41:00,360 --> 00:41:01,680
 - His cycle?

1240
00:41:01,680 --> 00:41:02,520
 His ring cycle?

1241
00:41:02,520 --> 00:41:03,400
 (laughing)

1242
00:41:03,400 --> 00:41:04,360
 - It's Wagner, yeah.

1243
00:41:04,360 --> 00:41:07,520
 He's a conductor, and so he's conducted lots and lots

1244
00:41:07,520 --> 00:41:08,800
 of things, won loads and loads of Grammys,

1245
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:11,840
 won 31 as a recording artist.

1246
00:41:11,840 --> 00:41:15,200
 And yeah, Salty's ring is one of the greatest

1247
00:41:15,200 --> 00:41:18,720
 musical pieces ever made, and it's not funny in any way.

1248
00:41:18,720 --> 00:41:23,160
 And he was the conductor at the Covent Garden opera house.

1249
00:41:23,160 --> 00:41:25,360
 And when he first came here,

1250
00:41:25,360 --> 00:41:27,720
 because obviously we're in Covent Garden at the moment,

1251
00:41:27,720 --> 00:41:30,440
 there was like a clique in Covent Garden

1252
00:41:30,440 --> 00:41:31,840
 that really, really hated him,

1253
00:41:31,840 --> 00:41:34,480
 'cause they didn't like when new musical directors came in,

1254
00:41:34,480 --> 00:41:35,760
 they really hated it.

1255
00:41:35,760 --> 00:41:37,520
 And so when he first arrived,

1256
00:41:37,520 --> 00:41:40,200
 people threw rotten vegetables at him in the street,

1257
00:41:40,200 --> 00:41:43,560
 and his car was vandalized outside Covent Garden Theater

1258
00:41:43,560 --> 00:41:46,000
 where the word Salty must go

1259
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:48,120
 scratched into his paintwork.

1260
00:41:48,120 --> 00:41:50,880
 - Wow, that doesn't sound like the actions of opera fans.

1261
00:41:50,880 --> 00:41:53,000
 - Ah, it's just cliques, isn't it?

1262
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:54,760
 You know, it's just groups of people

1263
00:41:54,760 --> 00:41:58,600
 don't like outsiders coming in with their Salty ways.

1264
00:41:58,600 --> 00:42:01,280
 - They called him the Screaming Skull.

1265
00:42:01,280 --> 00:42:02,320
 - Yeah, really?

1266
00:42:02,320 --> 00:42:03,280
 - But I don't know if that,

1267
00:42:03,280 --> 00:42:04,560
 I don't think that was a criticism.

1268
00:42:04,560 --> 00:42:06,720
 I think that was more like he was quite a vigorous man

1269
00:42:06,720 --> 00:42:08,800
 and he was bald.

1270
00:42:08,800 --> 00:42:09,840
 But you know, conductors,

1271
00:42:09,840 --> 00:42:12,000
 they do a lot of like shouting and gesticulating.

1272
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:13,000
 - Yeah, yeah.

1273
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:14,240
 - So Screaming Skull.

1274
00:42:14,240 --> 00:42:16,160
 - I really like the non-famous,

1275
00:42:16,160 --> 00:42:17,480
 the non-televised Grammy categories,

1276
00:42:17,480 --> 00:42:18,320
 I just think they're great.

1277
00:42:18,320 --> 00:42:19,280
 'Cause there are so many,

1278
00:42:19,280 --> 00:42:21,200
 I didn't realize there are dozens and dozens of categories.

1279
00:42:21,200 --> 00:42:23,280
 - But things like Best Tropical Latin Album

1280
00:42:23,280 --> 00:42:27,400
 or Best Contemporary Christian Music Performance/Song.

1281
00:42:27,400 --> 00:42:29,280
 And there is a screening committee

1282
00:42:29,280 --> 00:42:31,040
 which assesses whether or not

1283
00:42:31,040 --> 00:42:33,000
 you are actually fitting into that category or not,

1284
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:34,560
 'cause it would be much easier, I think,

1285
00:42:34,560 --> 00:42:37,200
 to get a Grammy for some of these things where--

1286
00:42:37,200 --> 00:42:40,520
 - Yeah, but we can't put Led Zeppelin in the Christian--

1287
00:42:40,520 --> 00:42:42,120
 - No, but we, the four of us,

1288
00:42:42,120 --> 00:42:44,480
 could make a tropical Latin album.

1289
00:42:44,480 --> 00:42:45,320
 - Are we good?

1290
00:42:45,320 --> 00:42:46,160
 - Oh, I see.

1291
00:42:46,160 --> 00:42:47,000
 - Just game the system that way

1292
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:49,000
 by entering some of the less popular categories.

1293
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:52,160
 - And would that be part of our Mississippi River oeuvre

1294
00:42:52,160 --> 00:42:54,680
 or is the tropical Latin album like the follow-up?

1295
00:42:54,680 --> 00:42:58,040
 - I don't think you are even as in the tropics, is it?

1296
00:42:58,040 --> 00:42:59,760
 - I don't think, no, I don't think it could be.

1297
00:42:59,760 --> 00:43:00,600
 - No, it's like not.

1298
00:43:00,600 --> 00:43:02,880
 - But okay, here's one we could win, Best Album Notes.

1299
00:43:02,880 --> 00:43:03,720
 - Oh yeah.

1300
00:43:03,720 --> 00:43:04,800
 - Which really feels like a--

1301
00:43:04,800 --> 00:43:05,920
 - I know a winner of that.

1302
00:43:05,920 --> 00:43:09,360
 - Not personally, but I know someone who has won that award.

1303
00:43:09,360 --> 00:43:10,200
 - Who?

1304
00:43:10,200 --> 00:43:11,040
 - What are the album notes?

1305
00:43:11,040 --> 00:43:12,360
 Are they the lyrics that you write in there?

1306
00:43:12,360 --> 00:43:14,040
 - Do you know the sleeve notes that you used to get

1307
00:43:14,040 --> 00:43:15,840
 in a CD or in an LP?

1308
00:43:15,840 --> 00:43:17,540
 And young listeners would have completely--

1309
00:43:17,540 --> 00:43:18,380
 - Yeah, I do.

1310
00:43:18,380 --> 00:43:20,560
 Where you write Beyonce, I remember a Destiny's Child,

1311
00:43:20,560 --> 00:43:21,860
 they all wrote how much they loved God.

1312
00:43:21,860 --> 00:43:24,280
 I found it so boring reading those things.

1313
00:43:24,280 --> 00:43:26,920
 - Well, they might not have won that year's Best Album Notes

1314
00:43:26,920 --> 00:43:27,760
 category.

1315
00:43:27,760 --> 00:43:28,600
 - Dan, who do you know?

1316
00:43:28,600 --> 00:43:29,440
 Who's been there?

1317
00:43:29,440 --> 00:43:30,920
 - Steve Martin, the comedian, has won them.

1318
00:43:30,920 --> 00:43:32,600
 - I bet he's written some really good album notes, yeah.

1319
00:43:32,600 --> 00:43:35,720
 - For his banjo albums, not for his comedy albums.

1320
00:43:35,720 --> 00:43:36,560
 - You don't know. - It feels like

1321
00:43:36,560 --> 00:43:37,380
 it played with strings.

1322
00:43:37,380 --> 00:43:38,220
 - Do you know Steve Martin?

1323
00:43:38,220 --> 00:43:40,500
 - No, that's when I said I know someone,

1324
00:43:40,500 --> 00:43:43,080
 and then I qualified it by saying I don't know them.

1325
00:43:43,080 --> 00:43:44,400
 - Right.

1326
00:43:44,400 --> 00:43:47,000
 So it was the last a statement was true, yeah.

1327
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:48,560
 - Is aware of.

1328
00:43:48,560 --> 00:43:49,880
 I know Robin Thickey, although I don't know

1329
00:43:49,880 --> 00:43:50,720
 how to say his name.

1330
00:43:50,720 --> 00:43:53,120
 (all laughing)

1331
00:43:53,120 --> 00:43:56,480
 - It's very controversial the way they vote in the Grammys.

1332
00:43:56,480 --> 00:43:59,760
 'Cause it's, well, until this year, it was super secret.

1333
00:43:59,760 --> 00:44:01,360
 It sounds quite exciting.

1334
00:44:01,360 --> 00:44:04,680
 And I think what used to happen was winners were decided

1335
00:44:04,680 --> 00:44:08,560
 by this like 12,000 strong recording Academy,

1336
00:44:08,560 --> 00:44:12,080
 bunch of voters who, they're like.

1337
00:44:12,080 --> 00:44:13,400
 (all laughing)

1338
00:44:13,400 --> 00:44:15,560
 - They all stand in a room and put their hands up

1339
00:44:15,560 --> 00:44:16,400
 and stuff, right?

1340
00:44:16,400 --> 00:44:21,000
 - Yeah, they crush in and, yeah, someone has to count them.

1341
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:23,000
 They, I guess it's probably done by post

1342
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:24,760
 and their musicians and music makers.

1343
00:44:24,760 --> 00:44:26,280
 - Probably you, Val, these days.

1344
00:44:26,280 --> 00:44:28,200
 (all laughing)

1345
00:44:28,200 --> 00:44:31,000
 - It was in the 90s that it changed.

1346
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:32,320
 - John Billings goes around, gets them

1347
00:44:32,320 --> 00:44:34,160
 in the back of the van, picks up the next one.

1348
00:44:34,160 --> 00:44:35,000
 (all laughing)

1349
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:37,120
 - But that's just the fake ones that he brings.

1350
00:44:37,120 --> 00:44:39,560
 (all laughing)

1351
00:44:39,560 --> 00:44:41,920
 So, yeah, it used to be done by this 12,000 strong

1352
00:44:41,920 --> 00:44:43,000
 and bunch of voters.

1353
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:44,920
 But then I think partly because the awards

1354
00:44:44,920 --> 00:44:47,920
 just kept going so wrong and they just kept giving it

1355
00:44:47,920 --> 00:44:49,080
 to weird people.

1356
00:44:49,080 --> 00:44:50,200
 They had to change the rules.

1357
00:44:50,200 --> 00:44:51,960
 And I think the straw that broke the camel's back

1358
00:44:51,960 --> 00:44:56,840
 came in the early 90s when over, album of the year was up

1359
00:44:56,840 --> 00:44:59,560
 and Bruce Springsteen's "Born in the USA" was released

1360
00:44:59,560 --> 00:45:01,360
 and "Princess Purple Rain" was released

1361
00:45:01,360 --> 00:45:04,320
 and Lionel Richie's "Can't Slow Down" won.

1362
00:45:04,320 --> 00:45:06,680
 And everyone said, we didn't like that.

1363
00:45:06,680 --> 00:45:07,880
 That's not as good as the other two.

1364
00:45:07,880 --> 00:45:10,720
 And so they formed a secret committee

1365
00:45:10,720 --> 00:45:12,600
 which basically goes through all the 12,000 votes

1366
00:45:12,600 --> 00:45:13,560
 and takes out the duds.

1367
00:45:13,560 --> 00:45:15,080
 - Because actually you would think

1368
00:45:15,080 --> 00:45:18,520
 that having a larger group, 12,000 would be more likely

1369
00:45:18,520 --> 00:45:20,160
 to give you a democratic answer, right?

1370
00:45:20,160 --> 00:45:21,240
 - Yeah, give you the best.

1371
00:45:21,240 --> 00:45:23,080
 - But a democratic answer isn't necessarily

1372
00:45:23,080 --> 00:45:24,080
 the best answer, James.

1373
00:45:24,080 --> 00:45:24,920
 - Is that not right?

1374
00:45:24,920 --> 00:45:25,760
 - Okay.

1375
00:45:25,760 --> 00:45:27,360
 - That's my view.

1376
00:45:27,360 --> 00:45:28,560
 (all laughing)

1377
00:45:28,560 --> 00:45:31,760
 - My one way ticket to Russia is just to come through.

1378
00:45:31,760 --> 00:45:34,440
 Anyway, people got quite pissed off

1379
00:45:34,440 --> 00:45:35,280
 by the secret committee

1380
00:45:35,280 --> 00:45:37,680
 because no one knew how they voted or why they voted.

1381
00:45:37,680 --> 00:45:40,280
 And there's someone called The Weekend, I think.

1382
00:45:40,280 --> 00:45:41,120
 - Oh, The Weekend.

1383
00:45:41,120 --> 00:45:41,960
 - The Weekend.

1384
00:45:41,960 --> 00:45:42,800
 - Oh, right.

1385
00:45:42,800 --> 00:45:44,120
 (all laughing)

1386
00:45:44,120 --> 00:45:45,320
 Well, it's spelled The Weekend.

1387
00:45:45,320 --> 00:45:46,160
 - Weekend, yeah, yeah.

1388
00:45:46,160 --> 00:45:47,000
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1389
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:48,360
 (all laughing)

1390
00:45:48,360 --> 00:45:49,200
 - They, he--

1391
00:45:49,200 --> 00:45:50,920
 - Fred, the Robin picky, I believe.

1392
00:45:50,920 --> 00:45:51,760
 (all laughing)

1393
00:45:51,760 --> 00:45:54,160
 - This show has certainly weakened over the years, hasn't it?

1394
00:45:54,160 --> 00:45:55,960
 (all laughing)

1395
00:45:55,960 --> 00:45:57,320
 - Yeah, so it's felt like Weekend.

1396
00:45:57,320 --> 00:45:59,760
 Anyway, but without any, so he--

1397
00:45:59,760 --> 00:46:01,080
 - Well, with two E's.

1398
00:46:01,080 --> 00:46:03,660
 (all laughing)

1399
00:46:03,660 --> 00:46:06,520
 - But not three.

1400
00:46:06,520 --> 00:46:07,920
 Anyway, The Weekend got annoyed

1401
00:46:07,920 --> 00:46:09,880
 that he hadn't got nominated.

1402
00:46:09,880 --> 00:46:10,920
 - He's pronounced the Weckend.

1403
00:46:10,920 --> 00:46:13,920

 where we give Anna the name of all the partners

1407
00:46:20,800 --> 00:46:24,360
 that are in the charts and see if she can pronounce them.

1408
00:46:24,360 --> 00:46:26,440
 - They've asked me to read out the nominations next show.
