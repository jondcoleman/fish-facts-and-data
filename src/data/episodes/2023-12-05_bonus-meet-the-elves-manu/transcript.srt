00:00:13,760 --> 00:00:20,320
 Welcome to Meet the Elves, your semi-regular bit of bonus material where we meet one of the

3
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:27,680
 QI researchers, the brains behind the TV show QI, where we all began our careers and today we are

4
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:36,960
 meeting Manu Ongrio. Hey, I'm so impressed, that was so so nearly perfect. Nearly perfect.

5
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:43,120
 For our practice before we hit record. Thank you, thank you. And Manu has brought in a question for

6
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:47,920
 us and she's going to tell us the question and we're going to spend around 20 minutes trying to

7
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:52,880
 answer the question and see where our conversation takes us in the meantime. So Manu why don't you

8
00:00:52,880 --> 00:01:01,040
 give us your question. Okay, so my question today is what links daylight savings, orgasms

9
00:01:01,040 --> 00:01:13,600
 and the International Space Station? Oh wow. What colour is the grass?

10
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:22,000
 Is this your first ever one of these? It is, yeah yeah yeah and I did not hone my wits well enough.

11
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:28,720
 Now can we pause and I'll research that for you. Okay let's look at the clues. We've got two space

12
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:35,360
 elements here I would say because daylight savings, the sun is in space. That's right, it is yes.

13
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:39,280
 And also you're saving a lot of day when you're traveling around the planet in the International

14
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:44,320
 Space Station. Well you see lots of sunsets and sunrises don't you? I do. I forgot the third one.

15
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:49,840
 You're constantly orgasming in space as the other thing. There's chat about whether anyone will

16
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:53,280
 ever have sex in space and there's a rumour that two astronauts have had sex on the International

17
00:01:53,280 --> 00:02:00,080
 Space Station. That's true. Husband and wife. Not verified I don't think. I think it was debunked

18
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:04,720
 actually. I don't think they did. Yeah I think it was. Yeah but they would say wouldn't they?

19
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:10,640
 Is this an area of expertise for you, space? No not at all. I actually had to look up what

20
00:02:10,640 --> 00:02:14,960
 daylight savings was properly before I did this question. What's your thing as an elf then because

21
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:22,480
 most elves have sex. Just constantly orgasming. I don't know about orgasms but I need to sound

22
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:29,200
 yeah clever. As an elf I actually so I studied humanities but I really really like zoology

23
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:34,800
 in our research so fish, love a bit of fish research and frogs. Is this a clue as well as to

24
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:38,640
 where we're going to go with the question? Absolutely not. Damn it I was hoping we would.

25
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:48,000
 Okay so it's not zoological orgasms. It's not an animal that orgasms. Is it human orgasms

26
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:55,120
 specifically? It's related to human orgasms. Okay related to in the way that we're related to

27
00:02:55,120 --> 00:03:02,320
 lots of animals. It's just a quiz. I'm just trying to work out if you're sending us down wrong roads.

28
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:08,800
 Okay so what do we know about daylight savings times? Invented by William Willett.

29
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:17,360
 Who isn't he a oh I bet he's related to. It's called Willy. I found the orgasm link.

30
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:24,640
 Stop damning this down. I believe he's related. Isn't he related to someone famous? Oh Chris

31
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:27,760
 Martin from Coldplay. Yes that's right. Isn't he descended from one of the people who invented

32
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:34,960
 daylight savings? Yes because one of their songs is called Daylight Savings. Yeah clocks is paying

33
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:40,800
 homage. Sorry the video of the scientist he's going backwards all the way through it and that's

34
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:44,480
 because you put the clocks back don't you with daylight savings. Oh that's good. It's a reference

35
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:49,920
 to that I think. And what's the other thing that we have to link it to? Orgasms. Orgasms daylight

36
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:54,800
 saving and the International Space Station. I haven't linked it to either of the other two.

37
00:03:54,800 --> 00:04:02,560
 I've just talked about Coldplay. Okay so daylight savings uh often kind of invented during the war

38
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:09,920
 I think to save people's. Wasn't it to get the farmers up earlier. Also Benjamin Franklin was

39
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:17,840
 well into it. Yes. I think uh happens in lots of countries. Britain being one of them. Okay here's

40
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:23,840
 a theory. The International Space Station was launched at the wrong time because the person

41
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:28,640
 who was meant to be at the space station to launch it was having an orgasm.

42
00:04:28,640 --> 00:04:34,000
 Looked at the clock thought I can afford to have an orgasm. Did not realize it's.

43
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:46,800
 I have another question. Yes. Another of your specialties is food because we're currently

44
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:53,120
 working on a possible new food podcast which involves you. Is this question food related in

45
00:04:53,120 --> 00:05:00,240
 any way? I wish it were. Oh it's not food related. It's not food related. Is it clocks can go backwards.

46
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:13,200
 Can cocks go backwards? So it does one part of the answer. It is to do with a disproportionate

47
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:19,680
 effect on men. Okay. But it's counter-intuitive. I'm just thinking people when they come back from

48
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:25,520
 space um often like they've lost quite a lot of muscle mass. Yeah. So they're shorter. I wonder

49
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:29,840
 if men are disproportionately affected or I think actually women are. Is it to do it's not to do with

50
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:36,320
 the ISS experience being affecting men. No. Does the lack of gravity affect your ability to ejaculate?

51
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:44,400
 I'm not sure. But it is related to a lack of gravity as well. I want to build some thinking

52
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:49,520
 time in the background here. Can I ask you how you became a QIL before I do that? Yeah for sure.

53
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:55,360
 So it actually involves Anna. Who does? Can blame her. I blame myself as well. It's a

54
00:05:55,360 --> 00:06:06,640
 oh big mistake. So I used to listen. I listen to the podcast. Wow until I met you assholes.

55
00:06:06,640 --> 00:06:14,160
 I used to enjoy that podcast. No I love working on it. Thank you. But yeah so I was really really

56
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:23,840
 into no such thing and I emailed Anna and was like I think can I steal your job or the email

57
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:29,040
 title was. I think that was a subject line yeah. Yeah it was very bold and a year later she emailed

58
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:36,640
 me back. Wow. That was actually a quick response time for me. Wow. Well I'm honoured. We're going to

59
00:06:36,640 --> 00:06:42,560
 do a podcast at qi.com. You've got a job. Yeah that's pretty cool. That's pretty cool man. And it's been

60
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:47,840
 what two years? Almost three years? Yeah and you because you were a chef before weren't you? Yeah

61
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:53,440
 which was slightly less harrow now I'm joking. It was a lot more stressful that hours were insane

62
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:58,880
 but I always wanted to research. I actually did research after I was a chef and did a

63
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:04,000
 like ethnography on women in kitchens. I was going to say weren't you so traumatised by

64
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:09,040
 chefing that you went on to do an academic career and how bad it is. But it was fascinating though.

65
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:13,520
 I got to meet some really cool women and eat some really really good food. Give an example

66
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:19,440
 of a cool woman you met in that period. I met a woman who runs a Thai kitchen in South London

67
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:25,120
 and she trained under like I think the first Michelin star Thai chef in the world and she was

68
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:29,680
 amazing and her team was really small and they're all super sweet. I got taught how to make you know

69
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:34,640
 there's like dumplings that kind of shape like a semi circle like a moon. Like a gyoza kind of thing.

70
00:07:34,640 --> 00:07:41,680
 Yeah yeah so I did that for ages. Wow very cool. Has that given you any time? Yeah I've used my

71
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:46,640
 time wisely and I actually think I've worked it out. Can't hit me. But I don't want to shoot

72
00:07:46,640 --> 00:07:53,360
 my load too soon. Stop the podcast. I am actually going to have a genuine guess here. Is it that

73
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:59,360
 neither orgasms or daylight saving exist on the International Space Station? I can't say no.

74
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:05,120
 Oh okay so I'm not sure but that is quite far away from the answer. That's not the answer.

75
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:09,600
 That's not the answer. We're not in the territory. I am so sorry. Oh my god that's so clever for one

76
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:13,680
 second. I mean it probably can say orgasms exist on the International Space Station.

77
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:19,040
 But they're banned right? Are they? Well the sex is banned. I don't know if masturbation is

78
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:25,840
 sure they must be allowed to. I can't think you can ban masturbation in any job as long as it's.

79
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:28,880
 I wonder if officially no orgasm has ever happened in space. I've got

80
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:35,040
 I've got an idea. Yeah the ISS is like a joint project between the West and Russia

81
00:08:35,040 --> 00:08:38,640
 and when I have sex with my wife it is also a joint.

82
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:44,240
 You're doing us all such a diplomatic favour.

83
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:52,960
 Is that the answer? No man it's not even dignifying us with a desert. I really want to say yes.

84
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:59,920
 I want to hear how you're going to loop Daylight Savings Time and Coldplay have written a song about us.

85
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:05,920
 Is it good? So is one of them related to a fact that we might know through QI?

86
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:12,080
 Daylight saving time causes accidents. Is it that? No. It's to be fair the Daylight Savings

87
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:18,000
 one is really mean. It does throw it throws the thing off. Okay focus on orgasms and the ISS.

88
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:24,800
 I think focusing on the body. So what it does to the body? Is it to do with like so the bit the G

89
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:31,280
 spot is the bit the body you orgasm through was named after a man the ISS. Oh that's interesting

90
00:09:31,280 --> 00:09:39,680
 yeah. Has certain amount of Gs as in gravitational Gs. Yeah. Or is there a connective scientist who

91
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:45,200
 studied orgasms like is that yeah is there a scientist connected between orgasm research and

92
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:52,960
 the ISS? No. Okay that's not your answer anyway. I think you can zoom out of the ISS so it's not

93
00:09:52,960 --> 00:10:00,880
 necessarily the International Space Station. Is it space? Space travel. Is it to do with time

94
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:08,080
 dilation so that when you travel quickly through space the amount of time that passes according to

95
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:14,560
 you is different to the person standing on the earth so time changes and when you have an orgasm

96
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:20,880
 it's almost like time stands still. We're learning so much about James in this sense.

97
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:26,560
 Sort of too much personal information I'm inferring from a lot of these comments.

98
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:30,800
 Can we get one more clue? One more clue. Oh wait hang on sorry I had a question about

99
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:34,400
 because I was thinking about space travel. Is it about spacesuits and like what you can do in a

100
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:40,240
 spacesuit and have people orgasmed like I know urinating in spacesuits is a thing.

101
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:50,640
 You know it's not about spacesuits. The space bit is quite broad. Okay. There are lots of

102
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:56,400
 reasons why space is involved. Okay so you mentioned the body that was a different clue earlier. So

103
00:10:56,400 --> 00:11:02,720
 obviously space has effects on the body while you're in space. Daylight saving would have jet laggy

104
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:12,800
 kind of effects I think on this is to do with Venus fly traps. Wow. Never has a man been so close

105
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:19,520
 to an ulcer one second and yet so far away a second later. So hopeful. Why would you say that?

106
00:11:19,520 --> 00:11:22,960
 Is that related to some clever thing about they said the Venus fly trap into space in it?

107
00:11:22,960 --> 00:11:27,280
 I was just thinking about jet lag that plants get when they fly and then I thought okay we're

108
00:11:27,280 --> 00:11:32,480
 thinking in terms of animal orgasms here but obviously plants orgasm too. No I think you were

109
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:38,240
 really I felt like Dan was close. It's just that as Dan was talking Manu was her eyes were opening

110
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:42,480
 like you're getting there you're getting there and then he said Venus fly trap and it was suddenly

111
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:48,960
 just disappointment is what I would say. I'm going to run with some things that Dan said. Cool.

112
00:11:48,960 --> 00:11:58,080
 Venus fly trap. So other it's a picture plant. No is it about the effect that things have on your

113
00:11:58,080 --> 00:12:04,640
 body like I can't imagine daylight savings causes a laggy kind of effect. Orgasms do you get like

114
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:12,080
 a sort of a feeling of innovation after an orgasm? You also get rhinitis. Rhinitis is

115
00:12:12,080 --> 00:12:20,320
 like a blocked nose you can get after an orgasm. Oh so you're getting very close. Well they make

116
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:31,280
 you blind so is it about that? What? Yeah orgasms they're tiny blind don't they? That's the only

117
00:12:31,280 --> 00:12:36,640
 masturbating I suppose but I did in our research for the podcast today I was reading a like early

118
00:12:36,640 --> 00:12:40,160
 19th century thing because you know how you you know boys are always told if you masturbate too

119
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:46,240
 much you'll go blind and I read it in like an early 19th century tract that's how long people

120
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:50,240
 have been being told it for that you'll go blind if you masturbate yeah so maybe it is true.

121
00:12:50,240 --> 00:13:04,080
 So are we talking about illnesses that can be caused through perhaps orgasms and perhaps being

122
00:13:04,080 --> 00:13:12,240
 in space? Yes. Ah okay and it's not blocked that stuffy noses. It's very like anatomically very

123
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:17,280
 close. Was this part of so there were two twins that were experimented on in terms of seeing how

124
00:13:17,280 --> 00:13:21,600
 the body changes Scott Kelly was the astronaut and his brother yeah and they worked out a few

125
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:25,760
 things one of the brothers got taller than the other when they came back down one was younger

126
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:29,920
 by a couple milliseconds as a result of time dilation of going around the planet

127
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:41,120
 and one would have boiling hot orgasms. Only in autumn and spring. Yes. Is it to do with that

128
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:44,800
 experiment? So it's going to be something to do with something that's anatomically close to your

129
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:51,680
 nose so I'm going to go sinuses. I mean I feel like you're getting closer. It is? Brain? Brain?

130
00:13:51,680 --> 00:14:01,360
 Was that the orgasm press? The weirdest when Harry met Sally. Redux. I probably won't have what

131
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:09,360
 she's having actually. You are pretty bang on I think. Okay your brain shrinks, your brain grows,

132
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:16,080
 your brain stays exactly the same volume. What else could your brain do apart from shrinking?

133
00:14:16,080 --> 00:14:21,360
 Get more cells, get hotter, harder, get colder, turn into a weird shape. I really just want to

134
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:27,360
 say dehydrate. Oh that's also related. Dehydrate. But it's related to that's actually one of the

135
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:32,480
 things I could have put in this list as well. More great matter, more one matter. What does

136
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:40,800
 dehydration do to you? It makes you thirsty. Yes. Gives you headaches. Exactly. Oh my god.

137
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:46,560
 You've got to stop agreeing with me when I say stuff as if I'm on the right track.

138
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:51,280
 But you just look so hopeful. I don't want to say no. All right so what is it you... So

139
00:14:51,280 --> 00:14:57,120
 daylight saving time, the ISS and orgasms and this question will give you headaches.

140
00:14:57,120 --> 00:15:01,520
 So daylight savings will give you headaches. So why does daylight savings give you a headache?

141
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:08,320
 Well this is why I said it's quite mean. So there's a paper in the 80s, some researchers found cluster

142
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:13,760
 headaches and migraines are more likely to happen around the longest and shortest days of the year

143
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:18,800
 particularly when the clocks change because it kind of puts your biological clock out of rhythm

144
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:22,720
 and they're not entirely sure what caused it. Are you sure it's not people going

145
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:26,960
 hang on what time is it? No hold on. Has it gone back or forward? I can't you know and that's that's

146
00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:34,080
 a headache. That is a big headache. But yeah so daylight savings causes headaches and then sex,

147
00:15:34,080 --> 00:15:40,080
 sexual headaches is a massive thing. Lots of articles. We both know that we're always lying about that.

148
00:15:40,080 --> 00:15:50,720
 Stop. You're not supposed to say. I can't believe you've gone as far as to claim it's true here.

149
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:59,280
 One paper in the 80s. Listen to the podcast. Look it's in the podcast. There's a question about it.

150
00:15:59,280 --> 00:16:06,160
 But yeah no. You get a headache when you've orgasms. Yeah so the international headache

151
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:15,840
 society has classed two main types. So you have type one which is pressure like and it gradually

152
00:16:15,840 --> 00:16:22,720
 increases with mounting sexual excitement and then type two which is explosive and can appear

153
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:28,080
 just before or at the moment of orgasm. Is it blood pressure related do we think? We think so.

154
00:16:28,080 --> 00:16:33,440
 They're again not entirely sure. We're not actually like a hundred percent sure what causes headaches

155
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:37,920
 like on a kind of biological neurobiological level. That's interesting actually. There's no pain

156
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:44,240
 receptors in your brain. It's bonkers. So yeah that's the sexual headache. What's really interesting

157
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:49,120
 is that the classic presentation so the people that are most likely to get a sexual headache

158
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:54,080
 are old middle aged white men. Really? Thank you for not looking at me or James when you said that.

159
00:16:54,080 --> 00:17:03,680
 Looked at the chair. She closed her eyes. Yeah and then space loads of things in space

160
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:08,800
 can cause headaches apparently. You have a lot of stress a lot of noise pollution. Sometimes when

161
00:17:08,800 --> 00:17:12,640
 the air vent opens and all the oxygen disappears from the space station. Yeah that all slight

162
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:19,840
 headache as well. But my favorite one is something that astronauts call puffy face bird legs which

163
00:17:19,840 --> 00:17:24,960
 is basically takes a few days for the water in your body to kind of regulate after you've reached

164
00:17:24,960 --> 00:17:30,000
 space because normally on earth it's all pulled down in your legs and when you get up it kind of

165
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:36,000
 like travels all over your body and your head swells up. So your legs get really skinny and your

166
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:42,160
 head gets massive and that pressure can cause a headache. Oh wow. You know when you see aliens

167
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:47,920
 damn. Yes they kind of had spindly legs and big heads. That's why. That's why. Well remember

168
00:17:47,920 --> 00:17:52,720
 Andy did a whole thing when we did our live show his first half showed the future impressions of

169
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:57,680
 what humans would be like if we went into space and kept evolving as a space faring species.

170
00:17:57,680 --> 00:18:02,320
 Our legs become redundant they're just we're just torsos and because you don't need them in

171
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:07,120
 space in with lack of gravity your hands are fine that's enough. But we're going to be on the planet.

172
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:10,640
 I don't think the aim is to just hurt us all out into space and let's float around. Well it's not

173
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:14,480
 the idea that we pop onto another planet. We don't have many planets so you know it might be

174
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:18,480
 possible that a space station like the like you know Star Trek they should Captain Kirk should

175
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:23,680
 have had no legs. It is the idea. But you know when you watch Star Trek and they're not floating around.

176
00:18:23,680 --> 00:18:32,160
 Yeah they were. It feels like they need the legs for the walking. Also they beam down to planets all

177
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:41,920
 the time in Star Trek. Andy's not here to back you up either isn't it. Can I ask you've been here

178
00:18:41,920 --> 00:18:45,920
 two years now do you have a memorable question that you got onto QI because I feel like that might

179
00:18:45,920 --> 00:18:52,560
 have not made it. Excuse me this was this was my shot purely in the complication because for us we

180
00:18:52,560 --> 00:18:56,560
 had half you know we've got a long time you were trying to fool us really you know you're trying

181
00:18:56,560 --> 00:19:02,800
 to fool the elves. I think maybe to do with um tools. I think that was in my first ever script.

182
00:19:02,800 --> 00:19:07,920
 Oh yeah. Oh really. It's something to do with the lesbian rule I quite like. Yeah what's a lesbian rule.

183
00:19:07,920 --> 00:19:14,720
 Yeah yeah. I associate you your first script with it being quite a sexy script actually. I'm sure

184
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:22,080
 there are a couple of orgasms involved. Only when you read it. Yeah. And also you often get in touch

185
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:27,360
 with academics and stuff like that for QI. Yes. You're the person who mostly is our attachment

186
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:31,360
 to whenever we want to speak to an academic you get in touch with them. That's cool that's always

187
00:19:31,360 --> 00:19:35,120
 the most fun thing. It is my favorite thing. Meeting our people behind the fence. Actually Dan

188
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:39,680
 used to do that. Yeah I was going to say Manu's the new you really. I've got the glasses and everything.

189
00:19:39,680 --> 00:19:47,280
 What was the one on taste who's that really great guy who researched his taste? Charles Spence.

190
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:52,320
 Absolute dude. Yeah he's very cool. What was it we were researching at the time? So we were looking

191
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:58,480
 at kind of taste illusions. Um but he's got a really interesting job title that I can't remember

192
00:19:58,480 --> 00:20:04,160
 off the top of my head now but he basically looks at like multi-sensory uh what's the in its

193
00:20:04,160 --> 00:20:10,880
 synesthesia. Yeah yeah um but with like taste and flavor and the weights of things and how that

194
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:14,400
 affects. Yeah that old thing that like a hot chocolate tastes nicer if it's drunk out of an

195
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:19,600
 orange cup. Exactly. That is all his wheelhouse isn't it? He works with Heston, Blumenthal doesn't he?

196
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:25,040
 Right what was he contacted for for QI? Um yeah just because we were doing like a whole bunch

197
00:20:25,040 --> 00:20:30,160
 of research on taste but then we ended up doing an experiment where we played different kinds of

198
00:20:30,160 --> 00:20:36,800
 music and ate different chocolates and one kind of music made the chocolate sweeter. Really? Oh wow

199
00:20:36,800 --> 00:20:41,120
 that is so interesting. Was it classical and metal music I think or something like that? Yeah like

200
00:20:41,120 --> 00:20:46,720
 kind of gentle melodic versus like really spiky and horrible. Yeah it was super cool. It was really

201
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:53,680
 fun. It was, we got to eat loads of chocolate. Okay well thank you very much Anu for joining us um

202
00:20:53,680 --> 00:20:59,440
 we'll see you again hopefully soon on This Meet the Elf. Can people find you on social media or not?

203
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:04,000
 Uh no unfortunately I'm very bad at social. No that's fine. Can you give your physical address

204
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:12,240
 then? That's fine. That's fine. Send me a letter. And the rest of us with Andy will be back again

205
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:17,440
 for a new piece of bonus material I suppose in two weeks time. That's right. Okay goodbye.

206
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:28,400
 So hi.
