 *sad piano music*

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.280
 Hello, and welcome to another episode of no such thing as a fish, a weekly podcast

00:00:20.280 --> 00:00:23.580
 coming to you from the QI offices in Covert Garden.

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:28.560
 My name is Dan Schreiber, I am sitting here with James Harkin, Anna Chazinski, and Andrew

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:33.000
 Hunch and Murray, and once again we have gathered around the microphones with our four favorite

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.800
 facts from the last seven days, and in no particular order, here we go.

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:39.600
 Starting with you, James.

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:45.240
 Okay, my fact this week is that due to climate change, nine out of the 21 cities that have

00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:50.360
 hosted the Winter Olympics will be too warm to do so by 2050.

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:54.300
 I was glad to see that you put climate change in air quotes there, James, just for the

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:59.420
 second. It's so cold, climate change. Yeah, sure they will.

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:04.460
 I did not do that to people at home, I wouldn't do that, but this is about the Winter Olympics

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:08.340
 and I'm really excited because the opening ceremony is happening now as we're doing this

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:09.340
 podcast.

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:10.340
 Is it really?

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:11.340
 Just right now.

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:14.860
 And by the time this goes out it will be one week into the Olympics, and Britain will

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:16.740
 be top of the medals chart, probably.

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:17.740
 Wow.

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:21.020
 I've heard things about Australia having a good year, so.

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:22.020
 Are they?

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:23.620
 Have you got a lot of snow in Australia?

00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:29.780
 No, but apparently nowhere does any more, so it's actually playing to our favour.

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:32.060
 Just on who's going to be where are the medals charts, there's a guy from Tonga.

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:33.060
 Is there?

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:34.060
 A head of him?

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:35.060
 No.

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:36.060
 He's really good.

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:39.060
 His name, and I hope I pronounce it right, is Peter Talfa Tafua, and he tried to learn

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:40.900
 cross-country skiing in a year.

00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:44.420
 He's the only Tonga athlete ever to have been in the summer and the Winter Olympics.

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:45.420
 Wow.

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:48.860
 He did all his training on roller skis and paved roads.

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:52.340
 He's basically a one-man cool runnings.

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:53.340
 He hates it as well.

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:54.340
 He's the other thing.

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:57.700
 He said, "Every time I ski, I feel like I die a little inside.

00:01:57.700 --> 00:02:01.300
 I still haven't had a race where I felt completely happy."

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:02.300
 Oh, no.

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:07.100
 So, even though this, you know, the climate is going to warm, and it's going to be all ruined

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:11.460
 by 2050, at the moment, everyone's really whining about how cold it is, aren't they?

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:16.180
 In Pyongchang, apparently, it's really absolutely freezing, but to an extent, the people don't

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:20.300
 really like, so I think it's meant to be about -10, but the windshield factor there, because

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:24.020
 it's so windy, brings it down to -25.

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:28.260
 And they're all tweeting that they can't do anything, and the Australian Olympic athlete

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:32.460
 called Lydia Lassiller was asked to be flag bearer in the ceremony, and she said, "It's

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:33.460
 too cold.

00:02:33.460 --> 00:02:34.460
 It's bad for my knees.

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:36.460
 I'm not going to be flag bearer for my country, sorry."

00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:37.460
 Wow.

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:38.460
 Is she going at all?

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:39.460
 Yeah, yeah, she's going, but she's the same.

00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:42.020
 Of course you think, if you go to the Winter Olympics, you should know what you're letting

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:44.060
 yourself in for, which is that it's going to be cold.

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:45.060
 Just wear an extra jumper.

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:46.060
 You wear an extra jumper, yeah.

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:47.060
 Maybe bring some gloves.

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:48.060
 I have no sympathy.

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:55.540
 Pyeongchang is 700 meters above sea level, and they call that the Happy 700, and they say that

00:02:55.540 --> 00:02:58.820
 it's the optimal altitude for humans and animals to live.

00:02:58.820 --> 00:02:59.820
 Really?

00:02:59.820 --> 00:03:00.820
 Apparently.

00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:01.820
 It is.

00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:04.500
 It is the coldest place on Earth for its altitude.

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:05.500
 Is that right?

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:06.500
 Yeah.

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:07.500
 Wow.

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:10.500
 And I think it's kind of too cold for it, it doesn't snow very much, so it's very dry,

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:12.140
 and it's mostly using fake snow, I think.

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:14.860
 Well, this guy from Tonga is going to be right at home, isn't he?

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:17.340
 He's going to be the other guy who could do it.

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:19.620
 Yeah, they stockpile fake snow.

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:20.620
 Yeah.

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:23.740
 So, in Sachi, when Sachi had the Winter Olympics, it was quite warm there.

00:03:23.740 --> 00:03:27.660
 They had the opposite problem to what they have now, and they stockpiled 60 million cubic

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:32.420
 feet of snow just so that they could layer it properly and beat the ski on it.

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:35.180
 Sachi is definitely one of these that will be too warm by 2015.

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:36.180
 That is probably too warm now.

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:37.180
 Wow.

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:38.180
 It was probably too warm when it happened.

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:39.180
 I think you're right.

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:43.580
 Well, have you seen all the reports of the 2022 Olympics, the Winter Olympics?

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:48.580
 This is in Beijing, so Beijing won it, and the photos that they showed of dead in the middle

00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:52.500
 of their winter was of the mountain range where it's going to be taking place, and it's

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:53.500
 just green.

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:54.500
 A whole thing.

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:55.940
 There's just no snow at all.

00:03:55.940 --> 00:04:02.820
 And so they're going to be using a lot of fake snow as well, and they won it off Almaty,

00:04:02.820 --> 00:04:08.580
 which is Kazakhstan, or yeah, Almaty and Kazakhstan, and they're slogan to rub it in was keeping

00:04:08.580 --> 00:04:12.660
 it real, because they were like, we've actually got snow for this winter Olympics, and they

00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:13.660
 still lost.

00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:21.260
 Do you know, in 1960, for the 1960 Winter Olympics, one of the cities that BED was Karachi in Pakistan?

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:22.260
 Wow.

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:24.860
 But do you have Himalayas there, I guess?

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:26.420
 Not in Karachi, actually.

00:04:26.420 --> 00:04:30.340
 They do have it in the north of the country, but they don't have it there.

00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:33.380
 They have no traditions of any winter sports.

00:04:33.380 --> 00:04:37.980
 It's a tropical city on the Arabian Sea, and the coldest temperature, it has ever had

00:04:37.980 --> 00:04:43.500
 that it's entire history, is zero degrees, never, ever gone below zero.

00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:44.500
 Wow.

00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:45.500
 They didn't win.

00:04:45.500 --> 00:04:49.020
 That's the thing about China, though, is that there's no tradition of skiing there, and

00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:53.020
 as a result, China has, with classic Chinese efficiency, just said, right, everyone is going

00:04:53.020 --> 00:04:54.580
 to learn to ski now.

00:04:54.580 --> 00:04:59.860
 So they've created 800 ski results, and they want, in the next four years, to get 300

00:04:59.860 --> 00:05:01.180
 million people skiing.

00:05:01.180 --> 00:05:07.380
 Do your China has more statues of footballers, soccer players than any other country apart from

00:05:07.380 --> 00:05:08.380
 Britain?

00:05:08.380 --> 00:05:09.380
 Does it really?

00:05:09.380 --> 00:05:10.380
 Yeah, just of Chinese footballers, or?

00:05:10.380 --> 00:05:12.380
 I think they're mostly not Chinese footballers.

00:05:12.380 --> 00:05:14.780
 Yeah, there'll be many British ones going to it.

00:05:14.780 --> 00:05:16.820
 Or Europeans, yeah, or Brazilians.

00:05:16.820 --> 00:05:18.860
 Why do they do that?

00:05:18.860 --> 00:05:22.620
 Because they like statues, and they like football.

00:05:22.620 --> 00:05:23.620
 Fair enough.

00:05:23.620 --> 00:05:27.780
 So they've taken story things, story checks out.

00:05:27.780 --> 00:05:32.060
 Did you hear about the Norwegian team at the Winter Olympics this year?

00:05:32.060 --> 00:05:33.060
 No.

00:05:33.060 --> 00:05:34.060
 No.

00:05:34.060 --> 00:05:35.060
 Every team, apparently, I didn't know this.

00:05:35.060 --> 00:05:37.300
 They take their own chefs to cook for you.

00:05:37.300 --> 00:05:42.020
 And the Norwegian team chefs ordered for the team's feeding for the next fortnight.

00:05:42.020 --> 00:05:44.540
 1500 eggs from a Korean delivery service.

00:05:44.540 --> 00:05:50.340
 Unfortunately, they made a slight mistake in translation, and they got 15,000 eggs delivered

00:05:50.340 --> 00:05:51.340
 to them.

00:05:51.340 --> 00:05:52.340
 Wow.

00:05:52.340 --> 00:05:53.340
 Yeah.

00:05:53.340 --> 00:05:54.340
 I've done that on a cardo before.

00:05:54.340 --> 00:05:58.660
 They said, yeah, the truck arrived, and they just kept bringing eggs in.

00:05:58.660 --> 00:06:00.620
 And basically, they got half a lorry full of eggs.

00:06:00.620 --> 00:06:02.620
 What are they going to do with them?

00:06:02.620 --> 00:06:06.540
 Well, what's funny is, I did find this story, actually, and there's a quote where everyone's

00:06:06.540 --> 00:06:09.700
 trying to make a massive story out of it, but all the quotes that they come back with,

00:06:09.700 --> 00:06:11.260
 they're just like, look, they'll probably use them, I guess.

00:06:11.260 --> 00:06:12.260
 I don't know.

00:06:12.260 --> 00:06:13.700
 Maybe the people that supplied them will take them back.

00:06:13.700 --> 00:06:14.700
 I don't know.

00:06:14.700 --> 00:06:15.700
 It's not a big issue.

00:06:15.700 --> 00:06:16.700
 No one cares.

00:06:16.700 --> 00:06:19.500
 It's not going to give us something.

00:06:19.500 --> 00:06:23.100
 I bet the people who had to heave the eggs all the way inside, and then were told

00:06:23.100 --> 00:06:24.100
 to remove them again.

00:06:24.100 --> 00:06:25.100
 Care quite a lot.

00:06:25.100 --> 00:06:27.060
 Yeah, Dan, that's a big story for those guys.

00:06:27.060 --> 00:06:33.740
 I think about the poor delivery guys.

00:06:33.740 --> 00:06:40.900
 I was looking into sports at the Winter Olympics that no longer exist, because I remember

00:06:40.900 --> 00:06:45.260
 ages ago, we did an actual Summer Olympics episode, and we found some things that used

00:06:45.260 --> 00:06:46.260
 to be a part of it.

00:06:46.260 --> 00:06:48.180
 There's quite a few good ones as well on this.

00:06:48.180 --> 00:06:51.660
 They used to do figure skating on skis today.

00:06:51.660 --> 00:06:52.660
 Yeah.

00:06:52.660 --> 00:06:55.540
 It was like ski ballet, I think.

00:06:55.540 --> 00:07:00.780
 It was either nicknamed or officially called, and so you could use the poles of the cross-country

00:07:00.780 --> 00:07:07.060
 skiing poles to do flips and so on, and it featured into Winter Olympics, but no longer

00:07:07.060 --> 00:07:08.060
 done.

00:07:08.060 --> 00:07:09.060
 Yeah.

00:07:09.060 --> 00:07:11.060
 They used to have a medal for mountain climbing.

00:07:11.060 --> 00:07:12.060
 Did they?

00:07:12.060 --> 00:07:15.220
 Well, they once had an award given out for mountain climbers, at the end of the very first

00:07:15.220 --> 00:07:16.220
 Winter Olympics.

00:07:16.220 --> 00:07:19.380
 Pierre Coubertin, the father of the Olympics.

00:07:19.380 --> 00:07:24.740
 He gave out a medal for Alpinisma, which is mountaineering, to Charles Granville Bruce,

00:07:24.740 --> 00:07:28.740
 and he had led an expedition to Mount Everest two years before, and it was to say, "Good

00:07:28.740 --> 00:07:29.740
 on you."

00:07:29.740 --> 00:07:30.740
 All right.

00:07:30.740 --> 00:07:31.740
 It was to say "Good on you" for the Everest thing.

00:07:31.740 --> 00:07:33.860
 It wasn't actually because he'd won mountain climbing in that.

00:07:33.860 --> 00:07:34.860
 But Wooden Tournament.

00:07:34.860 --> 00:07:36.740
 That guy didn't make it to the top of Everest, did he?

00:07:36.740 --> 00:07:37.740
 He did not.

00:07:37.740 --> 00:07:38.740
 So, why did he get a medal?

00:07:38.740 --> 00:07:39.740
 Well, he tried.

00:07:39.740 --> 00:07:40.740
 It was a consolation prize.

00:07:40.740 --> 00:07:41.740
 Yeah.

00:07:41.740 --> 00:07:42.740
 Okay.

00:07:42.740 --> 00:07:43.740
 What was his name, sorry?

00:07:43.740 --> 00:07:44.740
 Charles Granville Bruce.

00:07:44.740 --> 00:07:45.740
 Right, okay.

00:07:45.740 --> 00:07:52.860
 The ski drawing used to be a thing, didn't it? It was in the 1928 Olympics in Samarits,

00:07:52.860 --> 00:07:55.060
 and it's dog-pulled sledding.

00:07:55.060 --> 00:07:56.060
 Yes.

00:07:56.060 --> 00:07:58.020
 Where the dogs basically compete on your behalf.

00:07:58.020 --> 00:07:59.660
 I don't really know why we don't still do this.

00:07:59.660 --> 00:08:03.940
 It seems great, and it's a commonly done thing across kind of Northern Scandinavia.

00:08:03.940 --> 00:08:04.940
 It wasn't just dogs.

00:08:04.940 --> 00:08:05.940
 It was horses.

00:08:05.940 --> 00:08:06.940
 You could be pulled by horses.

00:08:06.940 --> 00:08:07.940
 Yeah.

00:08:07.940 --> 00:08:08.940
 Would you have dogs against horses?

00:08:08.940 --> 00:08:09.940
 I don't know.

00:08:09.940 --> 00:08:10.940
 Can you find that out?

00:08:10.940 --> 00:08:11.940
 Did you manage to find that out?

00:08:11.940 --> 00:08:12.940
 I think you've got to assume that you couldn't.

00:08:12.940 --> 00:08:13.940
 No.

00:08:13.940 --> 00:08:14.940
 You could have those.

00:08:14.940 --> 00:08:15.940
 One of those is going to be better than the other.

00:08:15.940 --> 00:08:16.940
 Yeah, exactly.

00:08:16.940 --> 00:08:19.340
 Hey, whichever one's better, you wouldn't choose the other one.

00:08:19.340 --> 00:08:22.260
 But it only appeared once, and both horses and dogs competed.

00:08:22.260 --> 00:08:23.460
 So did they do separate races?

00:08:23.460 --> 00:08:24.460
 Was that the dog race?

00:08:24.460 --> 00:08:29.820
 You could calculate how many dogs equaled one horse, and then have a rough rule of thumb

00:08:29.820 --> 00:08:30.820
 for that.

00:08:30.820 --> 00:08:31.820
 Because some horses are better than other horses.

00:08:31.820 --> 00:08:35.380
 Yeah, you could have set them ponies against greyhounds, and then, actually, that would

00:08:35.380 --> 00:08:36.380
 probably even out.

00:08:36.380 --> 00:08:38.940
 I don't think greyhounds are strong enough.

00:08:38.940 --> 00:08:40.340
 What if you had 200 greyhounds?

00:08:40.340 --> 00:08:43.060
 It's very hard to fit them on the podium.

00:08:43.060 --> 00:08:45.300
 I think it's quite important what you've been doing afterwards.

00:08:45.300 --> 00:08:47.700
 But then could you just do that with any animals?

00:08:47.700 --> 00:08:52.700
 Like with, you know, 5,000 snails off, half an elephant.

00:08:52.700 --> 00:08:53.700
 Yeah.

00:08:53.700 --> 00:08:54.700
 Half an elephant.

00:08:54.700 --> 00:09:01.900
 James, you've come to regret your half an elephant choice, I think.

00:09:01.900 --> 00:09:05.300
 Have you guys heard of the ice masters?

00:09:05.300 --> 00:09:06.300
 No.

00:09:06.300 --> 00:09:07.300
 They're real people.

00:09:07.300 --> 00:09:11.140
 And they control the snow and the ice for winter Olympic games.

00:09:11.140 --> 00:09:12.140
 Okay.

00:09:12.140 --> 00:09:15.380
 But there's an amazing article about them in the Smithsonian.

00:09:15.380 --> 00:09:19.820
 And before the games, they will spray onto, like, the bobsled tracks, for example, hundreds

00:09:19.820 --> 00:09:22.860
 of paper thin coats of ultra-purified water.

00:09:22.860 --> 00:09:27.020
 So it makes it completely smooth, so there are no bubbles, there are no impurities.

00:09:27.020 --> 00:09:30.860
 Because you can't just send a zamboni down the loose track.

00:09:30.860 --> 00:09:31.860
 And you can't just...

00:09:31.860 --> 00:09:32.860
 You can't zamboni it.

00:09:32.860 --> 00:09:35.780
 So you can't cheat in the loose.

00:09:35.780 --> 00:09:39.500
 And the way that people have cheated in the loose before is by heasing their sleds.

00:09:39.500 --> 00:09:44.500
 So in 1968, the East German women's team heated the bottom of their sleds, and so that slightly

00:09:44.500 --> 00:09:47.220
 melts the snow as you're going down, and it reduces friction.

00:09:47.220 --> 00:09:48.220
 Wow.

00:09:48.220 --> 00:09:50.500
 But it used to be legal, I think, in the very earliest games.

00:09:50.500 --> 00:09:51.500
 It was unorthodox.

00:09:51.500 --> 00:09:53.860
 People would call you a maverick, but it wasn't explicitly banned.

00:09:53.860 --> 00:09:54.860
 Is that right?

00:09:54.860 --> 00:09:55.860
 Yeah.

00:09:55.860 --> 00:09:58.700
 Do you know, in golf, you're allowed to heat your balls before the game starts, but you're

00:09:58.700 --> 00:10:01.540
 not allowed to artificially heat them during the round.

00:10:01.540 --> 00:10:04.300
 What was the advantage of heating your balls in golf?

00:10:04.300 --> 00:10:07.940
 Well, you know, they just stick to your thighs left, I guess, though.

00:10:07.940 --> 00:10:11.300
 Stick to your thighs.

00:10:11.300 --> 00:10:12.300
 Wow.

00:10:12.300 --> 00:10:13.300
 That was an issue.

00:10:13.300 --> 00:10:20.540
 Turned does a lot of nude golfing.

00:10:20.540 --> 00:10:21.540
 They might fly further.

00:10:21.540 --> 00:10:22.540
 I don't know.

00:10:22.540 --> 00:10:26.500
 I don't think anyone actually does this, but it is technically legal.

00:10:26.500 --> 00:10:31.660
 What qualifies as artificially heasing them, if they're just in your pocket?

00:10:31.660 --> 00:10:32.660
 That's fine.

00:10:32.660 --> 00:10:36.660
 Could you tuck them in your armpit?

00:10:36.660 --> 00:10:38.580
 It would mess with your stroke, wouldn't it?

00:10:38.580 --> 00:10:39.580
 Yeah, it would.

00:10:39.580 --> 00:10:41.940
 But your caddy could tuck them in his armpit.

00:10:41.940 --> 00:10:42.940
 Yeah.

00:10:42.940 --> 00:10:45.820
 The US have heated jackets this year.

00:10:45.820 --> 00:10:49.740
 Yeah, Ralph Lauren have designed their jackets, and they've got this super high tech design

00:10:49.740 --> 00:10:54.100
 where they contain apparently electronic conductive inks, which are printed inside their

00:10:54.100 --> 00:10:58.340
 jacket in the shape of the American flag, and they're attached to a battery pack.

00:10:58.340 --> 00:11:02.260
 And so it means that all the US competitors doing drill and fix the room artificially

00:11:02.260 --> 00:11:03.260
 heat it.

00:11:03.260 --> 00:11:10.220
 He don't wish harm on anyone, but I really, if those batteries do happen to overheat the

00:11:10.220 --> 00:11:11.220
 satellite.

00:11:11.220 --> 00:11:17.060
 Oh, imagine just having a massive American flag stars and stripes tattoo on your bag.

00:11:17.060 --> 00:11:18.060
 What happened?

00:11:18.060 --> 00:11:19.060
 Ralph Lauren happened.

00:11:19.060 --> 00:11:20.060
 Yeah.

00:11:20.060 --> 00:11:22.900
 That's quite nice though, because if everyone's outside having a cigarette, can everyone

00:11:22.900 --> 00:11:25.500
 just gather around the Americans to get heat off them?

00:11:25.500 --> 00:11:33.140
 I'm not sure during the Winter Olympics everyone goes outside for a cigarette.

00:11:33.140 --> 00:11:40.920
 You know Eddie the Eagle, our British celebrity who competed in the 1988 Olympics for anyone

00:11:40.920 --> 00:11:45.620
 who doesn't know, and he was the only ski jumper to have competed for the UK, and he was

00:11:45.620 --> 00:11:46.620
 terrible.

00:11:46.620 --> 00:11:49.540
 He meant they had to change the rules of the Olympics to make sure such terrible people

00:11:49.540 --> 00:11:51.860
 couldn't qualify in future.

00:11:51.860 --> 00:11:55.900
 But he was a plasterer when he entered, and he still works as a plasterer in Stroud.

00:11:55.900 --> 00:11:56.900
 Cool.

00:11:56.900 --> 00:11:57.900
 Which I just find so weird.

00:11:57.900 --> 00:12:00.860
 He's such a known name to everyone in Britain.

00:12:00.860 --> 00:12:03.580
 He's just hanging out in Stroud being a plasterer.

00:12:03.580 --> 00:12:08.060
 Must be weird to have a life where you're just a plasterer all the time, and then just for

00:12:08.060 --> 00:12:12.080
 two months, you're the most famous person in the whole of Britain, and you go to the Olympics

00:12:12.080 --> 00:12:13.580
 and then you were plasterer again.

00:12:13.580 --> 00:12:14.580
 So was that.

00:12:14.580 --> 00:12:17.940
 So when they made that movie of him, do you think he arrived at the cinema thinking, finally,

00:12:17.940 --> 00:12:20.340
 my plastering career is going to see it.

00:12:20.340 --> 00:12:21.340
 Oh, what?

00:12:21.340 --> 00:12:22.340
 They picked that one.

00:12:22.340 --> 00:12:23.340
 A fan?

00:12:23.340 --> 00:12:31.260
 OK, there's time for fact number two, and that is Chazinski.

00:12:31.260 --> 00:12:37.820
 My fact this week is that Canada has a strategic maple syrup reserve, and in 2012, a quarter

00:12:37.820 --> 00:12:40.900
 of the maple syrup in it was stolen.

00:12:40.900 --> 00:12:41.900
 And I love this.

00:12:41.900 --> 00:12:47.220
 I only just found out about this, but this is in Quebec, so Canada tapped 75% at least

00:12:47.220 --> 00:12:49.820
 of the global supply of maple syrup.

00:12:49.820 --> 00:12:51.820
 And so it provides a lot of jobs for people.

00:12:51.820 --> 00:12:55.140
 And so in the same way that there needs to be an oil reserve in the US, because the fluctuations

00:12:55.140 --> 00:13:00.580
 in the market, or if the maple trees suddenly die or whatever in Canada, they have a massive

00:13:00.580 --> 00:13:05.300
 reserve, so that the prices can stay stable and so that the supply can stay stable.

00:13:05.300 --> 00:13:07.540
 Stable or artificially high?

00:13:07.540 --> 00:13:08.700
 Or artificially high.

00:13:08.700 --> 00:13:13.940
 If you believe the whole cartel, this is a mafia kind of argument, which some do.

00:13:13.940 --> 00:13:14.940
 Some do.

00:13:14.940 --> 00:13:15.940
 I don't.

00:13:15.940 --> 00:13:16.940
 No, no.

00:13:16.940 --> 00:13:17.940
 You wouldn't want to get in trouble with those guys.

00:13:17.940 --> 00:13:23.220
 This was the largest theft ever investigated by Quebec police in their entire history.

00:13:23.220 --> 00:13:26.300
 That's kind of nice that it got to be something, a local product, isn't it?

00:13:26.300 --> 00:13:27.300
 Yeah.

00:13:27.300 --> 00:13:28.300
 Yeah.

00:13:28.300 --> 00:13:29.300
 Yeah.

00:13:29.300 --> 00:13:32.900
 It was $30 million worth was stolen, which I think was about 6,000 barrels.

00:13:32.900 --> 00:13:33.900
 6,000 barrels.

00:13:33.900 --> 00:13:39.180
 It was enough maple syrup to put one tablespoon on 183 million flapjacks.

00:13:39.180 --> 00:13:40.180
 OK.

00:13:40.180 --> 00:13:42.300
 Would you put maple syrup on a flapjack?

00:13:42.300 --> 00:13:46.020
 I think that maybe, now I read that, because I thought it said pancakes, and then I read

00:13:46.020 --> 00:13:47.020
 it, and it said flapjacks.

00:13:47.020 --> 00:13:48.940
 So, there are two options here.

00:13:48.940 --> 00:13:50.900
 One, I've written down the wrong word.

00:13:50.900 --> 00:13:54.500
 More likely, I've copy-pasted that word, and the word flapjack means something different

00:13:54.500 --> 00:13:55.500
 in colour.

00:13:55.500 --> 00:13:56.500
 Ah.

00:13:56.500 --> 00:13:58.260
 Anyway, there are these guys.

00:13:58.260 --> 00:14:04.100
 The federation-de-product-aerical de Quebec, which is, as you say, the syrup produces union.

00:14:04.100 --> 00:14:05.500
 And basically, they do.

00:14:05.500 --> 00:14:06.900
 They run the whole show.

00:14:06.900 --> 00:14:11.020
 You're not legally allowed to sell maple syrup to anyone except them.

00:14:11.020 --> 00:14:15.260
 And then they stockpile it, so that if the farmers have a really good year, buying

00:14:15.260 --> 00:14:18.460
 it, can't buy it really, really cheaply, and then screw the farmers over the next season.

00:14:18.460 --> 00:14:21.340
 However, a lot of farmers want freedom to stop doing that.

00:14:21.340 --> 00:14:25.180
 They do, because they can do things like, I didn't quite realise that this is how cartels

00:14:25.180 --> 00:14:30.300
 work, but the farmers don't get paid until the stockpilers have actually sold their syrup.

00:14:30.300 --> 00:14:33.460
 So, if they just decide that there's been a lot of maple syrup made that year, so they're

00:14:33.460 --> 00:14:36.300
 not going to sell a very high proportion of it, then the farmers aren't going to get

00:14:36.300 --> 00:14:39.700
 paid for their maple syrup until it's gone out into the market, which does seem a bit

00:14:39.700 --> 00:14:40.700
 frustrating.

00:14:40.700 --> 00:14:46.860
 And haven't they done what happened in America in 2002, a farmer called Marvin Horn decided

00:14:46.860 --> 00:14:49.860
 that he was not going to hand over his raisins anymore?

00:14:49.860 --> 00:14:56.820
 So the government, since World War II, had been stockpiling excess raisins from farmers,

00:14:56.820 --> 00:15:01.540
 because the market was flooded, basically, with raisins, and they didn't know what to do.

00:15:01.540 --> 00:15:07.220
 So they stopped farmers had to give any extra raisins that they had just over to the government.

00:15:07.220 --> 00:15:11.180
 And this guy, Marvin Horn, he said he wasn't going to hand them over anymore.

00:15:11.180 --> 00:15:14.980
 The government sued him for $680,000, but he won the case in the end.

00:15:14.980 --> 00:15:18.820
 Yeah, we won off to 13 years of grinding lawsuits in legal battles.

00:15:18.820 --> 00:15:19.820
 I mean, I know.

00:15:19.820 --> 00:15:21.740
 Well, doesn't everyone just do that?

00:15:21.740 --> 00:15:27.020
 There just needs to be one tree sapon farmer who's going to spend 13 years for the cause

00:15:27.020 --> 00:15:28.260
 of maple syrup in Canada.

00:15:28.260 --> 00:15:29.260
 I guess.

00:15:29.260 --> 00:15:31.540
 I think no one really wants to be the first one to do that.

00:15:31.540 --> 00:15:33.540
 But the raisin reserve is unbelievable.

00:15:33.540 --> 00:15:34.540
 Yeah, wow.

00:15:34.540 --> 00:15:35.540
 It's a real thing.

00:15:35.540 --> 00:15:36.540
 And it's still excess.

00:15:36.540 --> 00:15:38.780
 They're not even sure if they're going to go back to doing it, because this lawsuit has

00:15:38.780 --> 00:15:42.300
 thrown up everything up in the air, and they might cancel it now.

00:15:42.300 --> 00:15:43.300
 Wow.

00:15:43.300 --> 00:15:45.100
 I can't believe there's been a massive raisin stockpile.

00:15:45.100 --> 00:15:48.260
 Well, this is why this huge theft of all the maple syrup happened as well.

00:15:48.260 --> 00:15:52.780
 It's groups who are kind of objecting to this mafia-like hold they have over the market.

00:15:52.780 --> 00:15:57.700
 And it's discovered in July 2012 when they just did a routine check of this massive reserve.

00:15:57.700 --> 00:16:00.900
 And they realised that one of the barrels kind of tipped over too easily, and they looked

00:16:00.900 --> 00:16:02.700
 inside it, and they realised it was empty.

00:16:02.700 --> 00:16:07.500
 And then they inspected all the barrels and so many loads of them were filled with water.

00:16:07.500 --> 00:16:11.860
 And they realised that somehow someone had been siphoning out maple syrup, and they found

00:16:11.860 --> 00:16:16.060
 the people eventually who'd done it, and it turned out they'd hired some space out in

00:16:16.060 --> 00:16:20.740
 the big storage in the big warehouse, and they'd just been gradually siphoning the maple

00:16:20.740 --> 00:16:21.740
 syrup out.

00:16:21.740 --> 00:16:25.100
 So when you siphon petrol, you have to suck a little bit out, don't you?

00:16:25.100 --> 00:16:26.420
 And then you spit it out of your mouth.

00:16:26.420 --> 00:16:31.660
 I only know this from movies, and then you can siphon it by using the physics of siphons.

00:16:31.660 --> 00:16:32.660
 Yes.

00:16:32.660 --> 00:16:34.460
 And it's the same with maple syrup.

00:16:34.460 --> 00:16:36.260
 And if so, would you spit it out, probably not?

00:16:36.260 --> 00:16:37.260
 No.

00:16:37.260 --> 00:16:39.260
 You spit it out, but only onto a nearby pancake.

00:16:39.260 --> 00:16:40.260
 Or flapjack.

00:16:40.260 --> 00:16:41.260
 Or flapjack.

00:16:41.260 --> 00:16:48.220
 And the other thing is, once you steal all these barrels of maple syrup, what do you do?

00:16:48.220 --> 00:16:50.260
 Is there like a black market of maple syrup?

00:16:50.260 --> 00:16:51.260
 Yes.

00:16:51.260 --> 00:16:53.340
 A guy down the pub says, I've got a barrel here.

00:16:53.340 --> 00:16:54.340
 Yes.

00:16:54.340 --> 00:16:55.340
 There's a big black market.

00:16:55.340 --> 00:16:56.340
 That's what the rebels do.

00:16:56.340 --> 00:17:00.220
 Yeah, the black market maple syrup dealing is an issue in Canada, and that's how people

00:17:00.220 --> 00:17:01.220
 are getting around it.

00:17:01.220 --> 00:17:02.220
 So there are quite a few.

00:17:02.220 --> 00:17:03.220
 That's interesting.

00:17:03.220 --> 00:17:08.980
 Apparently, the price of a barrel of maple syrup is around $2,000, 13 times the price

00:17:08.980 --> 00:17:09.980
 of crude oil.

00:17:09.980 --> 00:17:10.980
 Wow.

00:17:10.980 --> 00:17:12.860
 So it's extremely expensive.

00:17:12.860 --> 00:17:14.820
 And tastier to suck out of a siphon?

00:17:14.820 --> 00:17:18.260
 Yes, but less good for running a car.

00:17:18.260 --> 00:17:19.260
 Yep.

00:17:19.260 --> 00:17:22.020
 They both got their advantages and disadvantages.

00:17:22.020 --> 00:17:24.580
 It would be a boring world if we were all alike.

00:17:24.580 --> 00:17:26.300
 But here's a thing.

00:17:26.300 --> 00:17:32.140
 If you are showing some pancakes or flapjacks on television for an advert, you want

00:17:32.140 --> 00:17:33.460
 to put maple syrup on it.

00:17:33.460 --> 00:17:38.060
 They often use motor oil because it looks better on camera than maple syrup.

00:17:38.060 --> 00:17:44.540
 But what about the demonstrator lady who then has to start eating it?

00:17:44.540 --> 00:17:45.540
 You see her.

00:17:45.540 --> 00:17:49.980
 You see her take it and she shoves it into a car to exhaust the fire.

00:17:49.980 --> 00:17:52.580
 Is that what you do with your motor oil?

00:17:52.580 --> 00:17:54.180
 My car doesn't work.

00:17:54.180 --> 00:17:59.500
 It's really weird.

00:17:59.500 --> 00:18:02.020
 So maple syrup, I didn't really know that you

00:18:02.020 --> 00:18:05.180
 could just cut into the side of a tree and it just comes out.

00:18:05.180 --> 00:18:06.180
 Not any old tree.

00:18:06.180 --> 00:18:07.180
 A good point.

00:18:07.180 --> 00:18:08.540
 That has to be a maple tree.

00:18:08.540 --> 00:18:09.540
 Yes.

00:18:09.540 --> 00:18:10.740
 With though, isn't it?

00:18:10.740 --> 00:18:11.740
 Yeah.

00:18:11.740 --> 00:18:15.500
 It's because trees store it in their roots for winter and then they convert it to sugar.

00:18:15.500 --> 00:18:18.540
 They store starch and then they convert it to sugar and then that's the sap.

00:18:18.540 --> 00:18:23.260
 And then you have to concentrate it about 50 times because it just comes out as a much

00:18:23.260 --> 00:18:25.140
 thinner liquid.

00:18:25.140 --> 00:18:28.100
 And the Algonquian aborigines would concentrate it.

00:18:28.100 --> 00:18:31.980
 They would either drop a hot stone in so that boils off the liquid or they would

00:18:31.980 --> 00:18:36.740
 let the sap freeze overnight and then at the top all the water has turned to ice and you

00:18:36.740 --> 00:18:37.740
 just get rid of the ice.

00:18:37.740 --> 00:18:38.740
 Wow.

00:18:38.740 --> 00:18:39.740
 Concentrated maple syrup.

00:18:39.740 --> 00:18:40.740
 That's so cool.

00:18:40.740 --> 00:18:41.740
 Wow.

00:18:41.740 --> 00:18:42.740
 And then that's it.

00:18:42.740 --> 00:18:43.740
 That's just as good as.

00:18:43.740 --> 00:18:46.660
 I think you have to look quite a lot of times to get it because these days it's really

00:18:46.660 --> 00:18:47.660
 concentrated stuff.

00:18:47.660 --> 00:18:48.660
 Yeah.

00:18:48.660 --> 00:18:49.660
 It's 66% sugar.

00:18:49.660 --> 00:18:52.260
 But you can only do it at certain times of the year, can't you?

00:18:52.260 --> 00:18:57.940
 You can only do it when it's freezing during the night time and warm during the day.

00:18:57.940 --> 00:19:02.300
 So that's when the sap starts flowing up and down and that's when it will tap out.

00:19:02.300 --> 00:19:06.380
 And I think that's why the reserve is so important because it has these really specific conditions

00:19:06.380 --> 00:19:09.820
 that it flourishes in so it's really easy to have a bad season.

00:19:09.820 --> 00:19:13.140
 But they've invented this amazing new way of getting maple syrup out which is actually

00:19:13.140 --> 00:19:17.780
 going to increase the yield they think tenfold when they master it and it's vacuuming.

00:19:17.780 --> 00:19:22.820
 So what they've done is they've attached vacuum vacuums to these maple trees and then they

00:19:22.820 --> 00:19:26.300
 connect all the vacuums with a pipe and it sucks the syrup out.

00:19:26.300 --> 00:19:30.580
 But it's incredible, it literally sucks the sugar almost straight up out of the ground.

00:19:30.580 --> 00:19:33.340
 So someone described it as being like a sugar straw.

00:19:33.340 --> 00:19:37.820
 So it basically is a way of sucking all the stuff out of the ground and then the tree turns

00:19:37.820 --> 00:19:41.060
 it kind of into the syrup that you want on the way up and then you can dump it in your

00:19:41.060 --> 00:19:42.060
 big bag.

00:19:42.060 --> 00:19:43.940
 It feels very unnatural that to me.

00:19:43.940 --> 00:19:44.940
 It's not authentic, is it?

00:19:44.940 --> 00:19:45.940
 No.

00:19:45.940 --> 00:19:46.940
 It feels sad for the tree.

00:19:46.940 --> 00:19:47.940
 It must be bad for something.

00:19:47.940 --> 00:19:48.940
 It must be bad for something.

00:19:48.940 --> 00:19:49.940
 Yeah.

00:19:49.940 --> 00:19:50.940
 It doesn't sound sustainable, does it?

00:19:50.940 --> 00:19:53.660
 Because the old method where you just drill a hole in and then people just hang

00:19:53.660 --> 00:19:56.740
 plastic bags off, and it just drains down.

00:19:56.740 --> 00:19:57.740
 We just leave a bucket.

00:19:57.740 --> 00:19:58.740
 Or a bucket.

00:19:58.740 --> 00:19:59.740
 It's a leak.

00:19:59.740 --> 00:20:01.700
 Does that feel natural to you, James?

00:20:01.700 --> 00:20:03.180
 Well, drilling...

00:20:03.180 --> 00:20:05.540
 James just eats the tree.

00:20:05.540 --> 00:20:09.380
 I think drilling is slightly unnatural, but I think attaching a massive vacuum cleaner

00:20:09.380 --> 00:20:11.300
 to something is the next level.

00:20:11.300 --> 00:20:12.300
 You're right.

00:20:12.300 --> 00:20:15.260
 Yeah, it's a few levels above, I would say.

00:20:15.260 --> 00:20:22.180
 China has more than 200,000 tons of frozen pork.

00:20:22.180 --> 00:20:26.700
 It's kind of hanging around, and that's because they do the same thing as Canada is doing with

00:20:26.700 --> 00:20:27.860
 its maple syrup.

00:20:27.860 --> 00:20:32.820
 So they have a strategic pork supply, and that's because they have more pigs than the next

00:20:32.820 --> 00:20:35.100
 40 pork producing countries combined.

00:20:35.100 --> 00:20:36.100
 Next 40?

00:20:36.100 --> 00:20:37.100
 Yeah.

00:20:37.100 --> 00:20:40.940
 And they're so massively dependent on this one commodity because loads, like some people

00:20:40.940 --> 00:20:46.420
 it's like 70% of the protein comes from pork, and so they need to keep the prices steady,

00:20:46.420 --> 00:20:49.060
 and this is one of the best ways to keep prices steady.

00:20:49.060 --> 00:20:51.580
 And they needed it actually in 2016, didn't they?

00:20:51.580 --> 00:20:52.580
 They really had to draw on it.

00:20:52.580 --> 00:20:54.180
 Yeah, they had a pork issue.

00:20:54.180 --> 00:20:55.180
 A pig issue.

00:20:55.180 --> 00:20:56.180
 What happened?

00:20:56.180 --> 00:20:57.180
 Pork coca lips.

00:20:57.180 --> 00:20:58.180
 Pork coca lips.

00:20:58.180 --> 00:20:59.180
 Yeah, sure.

00:20:59.180 --> 00:21:00.180
 A pork coca lips.

00:21:00.180 --> 00:21:01.180
 Pork coca lips.

00:21:01.180 --> 00:21:03.980
 Pork coca lips is better.

00:21:03.980 --> 00:21:13.540
 America sort of similarly has a reserve of helium because, in 1921, they thought the blimp

00:21:13.540 --> 00:21:18.980
 was going to be the ultimate war weapon for them, so they built these huge factories

00:21:18.980 --> 00:21:22.660
 for all the helium that they were keeping for their blimps, but they got rid of the blimps,

00:21:22.660 --> 00:21:26.500
 but they kept the helium, so they still have in Amarillo, Texas.

00:21:26.500 --> 00:21:32.180
 There's an 11 billion cubic feet reserve of helium that they've kept, and it's just

00:21:32.180 --> 00:21:33.180
 there.

00:21:33.180 --> 00:21:34.180
 It's just waiting.

00:21:34.180 --> 00:21:37.100
 But it's embarrassing, I think, for the people who were initially working on it when

00:21:37.100 --> 00:21:38.100
 they were asked what they did.

00:21:38.100 --> 00:21:41.220
 And they'd say, I worked for the military during helium, and then 10 years later, it was,

00:21:41.220 --> 00:21:42.220
 I worked for children's birthday parties.

00:21:42.220 --> 00:21:43.220
 Yeah.

00:21:43.220 --> 00:21:44.220
 It's a regular helium.

00:21:44.220 --> 00:21:49.860
 The kind of clowns we've seen leaving with a reserve, the biggest ice to the century.

00:21:49.860 --> 00:21:54.340
 How many, how much helium do you think you'd have to inhale before you could float away out

00:21:54.340 --> 00:21:55.340
 of the helium?

00:21:55.340 --> 00:21:56.340
 Too much.

00:21:56.340 --> 00:21:57.340
 Too much.

00:21:57.340 --> 00:21:58.340
 Too much.

00:21:58.340 --> 00:21:59.340
 An unhealthy amount, you know.

00:21:59.340 --> 00:22:01.860
 Yeah, I think you need to pump it your body full of it, basically.

00:22:01.860 --> 00:22:02.860
 Okay.

00:22:02.860 --> 00:22:03.860
 Hey, we need to move on.

00:22:03.860 --> 00:22:04.860
 We need to move on.

00:22:04.860 --> 00:22:05.860
 Just one, I think.

00:22:05.860 --> 00:22:06.860
 Yeah.

00:22:06.860 --> 00:22:11.580
 So the EU famously, especially in the '80s, had butter mountains and wine lakes for exactly

00:22:11.580 --> 00:22:13.220
 the same reason.

00:22:13.220 --> 00:22:17.060
 There was a building in Wiltshire that was holding enough butter to spread on 50 million

00:22:17.060 --> 00:22:23.220
 slices of toast, and the Monster Raving Looney party suggested that we should turn it into

00:22:23.220 --> 00:22:27.780
 a butter mountain, turn the butter mountain into a ski slope for Eddie the Eagle to practice

00:22:27.780 --> 00:22:28.780
 on.

00:22:28.780 --> 00:22:29.780
 Oh.

00:22:29.780 --> 00:22:30.780
 Oh, because of the soft landing.

00:22:30.780 --> 00:22:31.780
 Because it was a butterfly.

00:22:31.780 --> 00:22:36.980
 It was a bit like snow, because it's a mountain, bit like snow, and he needed somewhere

00:22:36.980 --> 00:22:37.980
 to practice.

00:22:37.980 --> 00:22:40.860
 Yeah, but I just also think that butter would be a really nice substance to fall on.

00:22:40.860 --> 00:22:45.100
 Just try and impose logic on the Monster Raving Looney party policy platform.

00:22:45.100 --> 00:22:47.860
 You're right.

00:22:47.860 --> 00:22:57.900
 Okay, it is time for fact number three, and that is Andy.

00:22:57.900 --> 00:23:02.380
 My fact is that when Russia invaded Finland in 1940, they were so convinced that they will

00:23:02.380 --> 00:23:08.820
 be welcomed with a celebration that they took musical instruments with them as they invaded.

00:23:08.820 --> 00:23:09.820
 And they were not.

00:23:09.820 --> 00:23:10.820
 No.

00:23:10.820 --> 00:23:11.820
 No.

00:23:11.820 --> 00:23:13.180
 So this is a thing called the Winter War.

00:23:13.180 --> 00:23:18.220
 It was between the Soviet Union and Finland, and it was part of the Second World War.

00:23:18.220 --> 00:23:21.940
 So the Second World War was in full swing, and the Soviet Union had, I think, wanted a bit

00:23:21.940 --> 00:23:24.060
 of Finnish territory.

00:23:24.060 --> 00:23:29.100
 And Finland said, no, we don't want to lease you this land or all for you to have it.

00:23:29.100 --> 00:23:30.820
 So Russia invaded.

00:23:30.820 --> 00:23:34.260
 And it was this very, very asymmetrical war.

00:23:34.260 --> 00:23:35.580
 Soviet Union had a lot of resources.

00:23:35.580 --> 00:23:37.340
 Finland had almost none.

00:23:37.340 --> 00:23:43.700
 And all right, the Soviet Union did win the war, sure, but they managed to really drag out

00:23:43.700 --> 00:23:44.700
 the campaign.

00:23:44.700 --> 00:23:47.060
 And they lost way more people.

00:23:47.060 --> 00:23:49.620
 I think they lost five times as many troops in the Winter War, didn't they?

00:23:49.620 --> 00:23:50.620
 The Soviet Union.

00:23:50.620 --> 00:23:51.620
 Yeah, the Soviet Union.

00:23:51.620 --> 00:23:52.620
 And it was a disaster for them.

00:23:52.620 --> 00:23:56.480
 It was one of those was that they, maybe they officially won it, because in the end, Finland

00:23:56.480 --> 00:24:00.980
 had to seed this bit of land that they wanted, but it was a disaster because they hadn't

00:24:00.980 --> 00:24:02.300
 expected it to be so rough.

00:24:02.300 --> 00:24:05.700
 Which is weird, because the main thing they weren't expecting, according to all accounts,

00:24:05.700 --> 00:24:08.420
 was the terrible weather and the freezing cold.

00:24:08.420 --> 00:24:11.100
 But you would have thought, I mean, that's what everyone else, the problem everyone else

00:24:11.100 --> 00:24:12.940
 stumbled into when invading Russia.

00:24:12.940 --> 00:24:16.500
 So you would have thought the Russians would know and be prepared.

00:24:16.500 --> 00:24:18.820
 Would they probably thought like a winter Olympian?

00:24:18.820 --> 00:24:19.820
 Good.

00:24:19.820 --> 00:24:20.820
 I know cold.

00:24:20.820 --> 00:24:22.300
 How cold is that going to be?

00:24:22.300 --> 00:24:24.060
 They probably thought they had it covered.

00:24:24.060 --> 00:24:25.060
 And it was another level.

00:24:25.060 --> 00:24:26.060
 Yeah.

00:24:26.060 --> 00:24:29.420
 I was reading into the Winter War and knew nothing about it.

00:24:29.420 --> 00:24:33.740
 And you know, when you do this kind of research, your eyes get sort of caught by things

00:24:33.740 --> 00:24:37.220
 like sausage war and you think, oh, that's going to be funny.

00:24:37.220 --> 00:24:39.420
 And it's not because it's war.

00:24:39.420 --> 00:24:45.540
 And basically what it was is the Soviets had managed to get into Finnish enemy lines and

00:24:45.540 --> 00:24:47.540
 snuck up on them from behind.

00:24:47.540 --> 00:24:51.300
 And so they caught them completely off guard and they were taking out a lot of their troops

00:24:51.300 --> 00:24:52.980
 as they were heading towards their camp.

00:24:52.980 --> 00:24:57.980
 But from the direction they came, they arrived at the bit of camp where the chefs had just

00:24:57.980 --> 00:25:00.180
 been making a massive meal for all of the troops.

00:25:00.180 --> 00:25:03.940
 So it was a ginormous tent full of just freshly made sausages.

00:25:03.940 --> 00:25:09.340
 And these poor soldiers who'd been starved and were freezing were so taken by the smell

00:25:09.340 --> 00:25:14.180
 and the fact that they'd not eaten that they just went in and they ate all of the sausages.

00:25:14.180 --> 00:25:17.860
 And while that was happening, the Finnish troops were able to regroup and get back in time

00:25:17.860 --> 00:25:18.860
 to defend it.

00:25:18.860 --> 00:25:21.260
 So no one officially, I think, won it necessarily.

00:25:21.260 --> 00:25:22.740
 It's just a little episode in the...

00:25:22.740 --> 00:25:25.500
 I think the Soviets got completely routed, didn't they?

00:25:25.500 --> 00:25:26.500
 Yeah.

00:25:26.500 --> 00:25:27.500
 That is quite funny.

00:25:27.500 --> 00:25:31.180
 But they kind of lost because they were too busy mongering sausages.

00:25:31.180 --> 00:25:32.460
 Yeah, I know the war, though.

00:25:32.460 --> 00:25:33.460
 It's a skirmish.

00:25:33.460 --> 00:25:34.460
 It's a sausage skirmish.

00:25:34.460 --> 00:25:35.460
 A sausage skirmish.

00:25:35.460 --> 00:25:36.460
 Yeah.

00:25:36.460 --> 00:25:39.860
 Do you know that the Finnish had saunas on the front line?

00:25:39.860 --> 00:25:40.860
 No.

00:25:40.860 --> 00:25:41.860
 Get out.

00:25:41.860 --> 00:25:46.660
 They took every Finnish soldier for every two or three days was allowed to go to one of

00:25:46.660 --> 00:25:47.660
 the saunas.

00:25:47.660 --> 00:25:50.700
 They wanted to carry the saunas with them as they were in front.

00:25:50.700 --> 00:25:54.820
 So they had a few mobile saunas, which I guess, probably on wheels.

00:25:54.820 --> 00:25:57.060
 I'm guessing about that or skis.

00:25:57.060 --> 00:26:01.540
 And they also utilized the saunas in villages around Finland.

00:26:01.540 --> 00:26:02.540
 Cool.

00:26:02.540 --> 00:26:06.420
 And it was really good, not just because it was saunas and Finnish people of saunas, but

00:26:06.420 --> 00:26:09.900
 also because it prevented frostbites and it helped kill bacteria.

00:26:09.900 --> 00:26:14.220
 So they didn't have nearly as many problems medically as the Russians did for that reason.

00:26:14.220 --> 00:26:15.220
 Oh, clever.

00:26:15.220 --> 00:26:16.220
 That's very good.

00:26:16.220 --> 00:26:17.900
 It was a guerrilla war, basically.

00:26:17.900 --> 00:26:18.900
 Yes.

00:26:18.900 --> 00:26:21.940
 And they took advantage of the fact, like in loads of guerrilla wars, the infrastructure

00:26:21.940 --> 00:26:22.940
 wasn't really there.

00:26:22.940 --> 00:26:24.540
 So there were very few roads into Finland.

00:26:24.540 --> 00:26:28.220
 And either side of the roads that you had, we incredibly thick forest.

00:26:28.220 --> 00:26:32.180
 So you would have a column of tanks and you might mind the road, so then the tanks have

00:26:32.180 --> 00:26:36.140
 to stop because one of the front ones has been damaged.

00:26:36.140 --> 00:26:39.860
 And then from that point on, the Finns just kind of appeared through the woodlands and

00:26:39.860 --> 00:26:43.460
 constantly, you know, harassed the Soviet troops.

00:26:43.460 --> 00:26:44.460
 On skis, mostly.

00:26:44.460 --> 00:26:45.460
 On skis.

00:26:45.460 --> 00:26:49.300
 And they were much better skis because they had trained to ski because they didn't have

00:26:49.300 --> 00:26:50.300
 this infrastructure at all.

00:26:50.300 --> 00:26:51.780
 So that's the only way you could get through.

00:26:51.780 --> 00:26:55.860
 I think the Soviets were just taught to wear skis, stand up, fire a gun, whereas the Finns

00:26:55.860 --> 00:26:57.460
 could actually dart about.

00:26:57.460 --> 00:27:00.900
 And the Soviet skis were just kind of ones that they kind of cobbled together, whereas the

00:27:00.900 --> 00:27:03.180
 Finnish people were all using their own skis.

00:27:03.180 --> 00:27:07.980
 And so the Soviet skis were so bad that when the Finnish kind of captured them, they just

00:27:07.980 --> 00:27:09.860
 were no use and they just used them for firewood.

00:27:09.860 --> 00:27:10.860
 Oh, really?

00:27:10.860 --> 00:27:11.860
 Sorry.

00:27:11.860 --> 00:27:12.860
 Wow.

00:27:12.860 --> 00:27:16.020
 And at the Winter Olympics, people have been throwing away their skis, haven't they?

00:27:16.020 --> 00:27:17.020
 Have they?

00:27:17.020 --> 00:27:18.020
 Yeah.

00:27:18.020 --> 00:27:19.020
 Oh, yeah, because it's too cold.

00:27:19.020 --> 00:27:25.140
 Apparently, the first time you try skis on practice runs, one of the coaches said that they

00:27:25.140 --> 00:27:28.620
 just turned to garbage the skis because they get damaged by it being too cold.

00:27:28.620 --> 00:27:29.620
 It warps.

00:27:29.620 --> 00:27:32.540
 So there's snow at his, I think, and then it's too cold and it warps the ski.

00:27:32.540 --> 00:27:33.540
 Wow.

00:27:33.540 --> 00:27:34.540
 Yeah.

00:27:34.540 --> 00:27:39.400
 I was just looking at wars where people have had way too high expectations that have turned

00:27:39.400 --> 00:27:40.400
 out to be wrong.

00:27:40.400 --> 00:27:45.100
 So these guys in Finland, you know, they had this band because they really thought that

00:27:45.100 --> 00:27:46.100
 they'd got the victory.

00:27:46.100 --> 00:27:47.100
 Yeah.

00:27:47.100 --> 00:27:52.180
 So, literally, in the ball war, I was reading about when British soldiers in the second ball

00:27:52.180 --> 00:27:57.020
 war were, they mounted this to this really good strategic point called Sion Kopp and it

00:27:57.020 --> 00:28:01.420
 was this hill and they got up quite easily and they realized there were very few casualties

00:28:01.420 --> 00:28:03.060
 and they were fighting the balls on all sides.

00:28:03.060 --> 00:28:06.340
 They made it to the top of this hill and it was brilliant and they thought we've like

00:28:06.340 --> 00:28:08.260
 achieved this massive victory.

00:28:08.260 --> 00:28:09.260
 We're going to be fine.

00:28:09.260 --> 00:28:12.940
 The leader of those troops and a message back to the general saying he could expect his

00:28:12.940 --> 00:28:17.580
 position to be held until Doomsday against all comers because they were at the peak of this

00:28:17.580 --> 00:28:21.260
 really important hill and they dug trenches in, planned to stay there.

00:28:21.260 --> 00:28:26.140
 So that was in the evening and there was a big fog hanging over them and the next morning

00:28:26.140 --> 00:28:30.060
 the fog lifted and it was one of those things where you think it's the peak of a mountain

00:28:30.060 --> 00:28:34.780
 but then the fog lifts and there's actually loads more peaks around and the fog lifted

00:28:34.780 --> 00:28:39.060
 and there were three more peaks on all sides and all the balls just sitting on them waiting

00:28:39.060 --> 00:28:42.500
 to get down at them going, you bunch of idiots.

00:28:42.500 --> 00:28:49.700
 And that is where the name of the cop Liverpool's football ground, one of the stands is called

00:28:49.700 --> 00:28:50.700
 the cop.

00:28:50.700 --> 00:28:53.460
 Because it was originally there.

00:28:53.460 --> 00:28:55.460
 That's amazing.

00:28:55.460 --> 00:29:01.220
 A lot of stadiums were built around this time, was it late 19th century, wasn't it?

00:29:01.220 --> 00:29:05.740
 It was kind of, this was a slanted bit of land and all these places where people were watching

00:29:05.740 --> 00:29:09.220
 football from was slanted bits of land so there were a few of them were named cops and

00:29:09.220 --> 00:29:11.180
 Liverpool's the one that's kind of stuck around.

00:29:11.180 --> 00:29:13.180
 That's very interesting.

00:29:13.180 --> 00:29:14.180
 Very interesting, yeah.

00:29:14.180 --> 00:29:20.060
 Do you guys know about Simon Hayha who I'm almost certain that's not how you pronounce his

00:29:20.060 --> 00:29:21.060
 name.

00:29:21.060 --> 00:29:24.420
 In fact, I'm going to come out and say it, that's not how you pronounce his name.

00:29:24.420 --> 00:29:25.860
 He was finished.

00:29:25.860 --> 00:29:30.260
 He has the most number of confirmed kills of any soldier in history.

00:29:30.260 --> 00:29:31.260
 Wow.

00:29:31.260 --> 00:29:38.980
 505 with his rifle alone and possibly 200 plus more and the Soviets were so worried about

00:29:38.980 --> 00:29:41.580
 him because he was like a sniper just taking people out.

00:29:41.580 --> 00:29:47.420
 They would send artillery strikes in order just to kill him because he killed probably

00:29:47.420 --> 00:29:51.380
 0.6% of all the Soviet fatalities in the Winter War were down to him.

00:29:51.380 --> 00:29:52.380
 Geez.

00:29:52.380 --> 00:29:53.380
 Oh my goodness.

00:29:53.380 --> 00:29:59.860
 And he had a full white camouflage suit so no one could ever see him and so they couldn't

00:29:59.860 --> 00:30:00.860
 see his breath.

00:30:00.860 --> 00:30:05.460
 He used to put snow in his mouth so that his breath would be cold so that they wouldn't

00:30:05.460 --> 00:30:06.460
 be able to see him that way.

00:30:06.460 --> 00:30:07.460
 That's amazing.

00:30:07.460 --> 00:30:10.620
 Why wasn't all Winter Army uniforms just white?

00:30:10.620 --> 00:30:11.620
 They were.

00:30:11.620 --> 00:30:15.380
 All the fins were all this fins and skis were in the white uniform.

00:30:15.380 --> 00:30:16.380
 They didn't eat snow.

00:30:16.380 --> 00:30:18.540
 No, but the Russians didn't.

00:30:18.540 --> 00:30:19.620
 They came in carcay.

00:30:19.620 --> 00:30:21.100
 So that was one another one of the problems.

00:30:21.100 --> 00:30:22.100
 Yeah, they were.

00:30:22.100 --> 00:30:23.100
 They got the wrong.

00:30:23.100 --> 00:30:24.100
 That's a bit of an oversight.

00:30:24.100 --> 00:30:28.940
 Big arrows above the same enemy here.

00:30:28.940 --> 00:30:35.300
 The lot of immigrants from America and Canada finishing immigrants to American Canada returned

00:30:35.300 --> 00:30:36.300
 home for the war.

00:30:36.300 --> 00:30:41.420
 They sort of came back to sort of help Finland out and they had a lot of volunteers as well

00:30:41.420 --> 00:30:42.420
 who did that.

00:30:42.420 --> 00:30:46.700
 One of which was the actor Christopher Lee who fought in the Winter War.

00:30:46.700 --> 00:30:47.700
 What?

00:30:47.700 --> 00:30:52.780
 Yeah, Sarah Man from the Hobbit movies Count Duku from the second Star Wars movie maker

00:30:52.780 --> 00:30:53.780
 from the man with a golden gun.

00:30:53.780 --> 00:30:54.780
 We know the filmography.

00:30:54.780 --> 00:30:56.980
 We didn't know he fought in the Winter War.

00:30:56.980 --> 00:30:57.980
 Yeah.

00:30:57.980 --> 00:30:58.980
 Doesn't say that on his IMDB.

00:30:58.980 --> 00:30:59.980
 Does it?

00:30:59.980 --> 00:31:00.980
 No, it's it's.

00:31:00.980 --> 00:31:01.980
 Yeah.

00:31:01.980 --> 00:31:05.660
 He was not on the front line but he was he went back for the effort and he was a volunteer

00:31:05.660 --> 00:31:06.660
 and he helps.

00:31:06.660 --> 00:31:08.860
 No, he was he was just going to start it.

00:31:08.860 --> 00:31:09.860
 He was.

00:31:09.860 --> 00:31:10.860
 Oh my gosh.

00:31:10.860 --> 00:31:11.860
 Oh my god.

00:31:11.860 --> 00:31:13.860
 You're better than that.

00:31:13.860 --> 00:31:18.260
 I'm not sure he is, James.

00:31:18.260 --> 00:31:19.260
 No, he was America.

00:31:19.260 --> 00:31:20.860
 He was just volunteering.

00:31:20.860 --> 00:31:25.500
 Dan, do you know there's a conspiracy theory that Finland doesn't exist?

00:31:25.500 --> 00:31:26.500
 No.

00:31:26.500 --> 00:31:27.500
 Oh my god.

00:31:27.500 --> 00:31:28.500
 What's the reason?

00:31:28.500 --> 00:31:29.500
 What's the reason?

00:31:29.500 --> 00:31:30.500
 The other one is the mix.

00:31:30.500 --> 00:31:31.500
 What's the reason?

00:31:31.500 --> 00:31:37.220
 The idea is that it was made up by the Soviet Union and Japan.

00:31:37.220 --> 00:31:40.780
 And the reason was that the fishing is so good around the Baltic Sea area.

00:31:40.780 --> 00:31:43.540
 They wanted other countries to think there's no point sending boats there because there's

00:31:43.540 --> 00:31:44.980
 a massive country in the way.

00:31:44.980 --> 00:31:45.980
 Oh wow.

00:31:45.980 --> 00:31:50.460
 And so the idea is that there is no such place as Finland and all the people who think

00:31:50.460 --> 00:31:56.740
 that they're Finnish are actually living in Estonia and other countries around there.

00:31:56.740 --> 00:32:00.900
 And according to the conspiracy theorists, the fact that it's called Finland is a clue

00:32:00.900 --> 00:32:03.180
 because fish have fiddens.

00:32:03.180 --> 00:32:04.580
 That's very good.

00:32:04.580 --> 00:32:05.580
 See?

00:32:05.580 --> 00:32:06.580
 Yeah.

00:32:06.580 --> 00:32:08.580
 Built on solid reasoning.

00:32:08.580 --> 00:32:17.860
 So who's buying all the saunas if it's not the thing?

00:32:17.860 --> 00:32:22.140
 Okay, it is time for our final fact of the show and that is my fact.

00:32:22.140 --> 00:32:28.620
 My fact this week is that Greek gods of the ocean include Poseidon, Triton, Oceanus

00:32:28.620 --> 00:32:36.420
 and Doris, Doris the God who just brought them all tea and biscuits in the afternoon.

00:32:36.420 --> 00:32:37.420
 Yeah.

00:32:37.420 --> 00:32:38.420
 So they're all oceanids.

00:32:38.420 --> 00:32:40.180
 Doris is an oceanid.

00:32:40.180 --> 00:32:42.500
 She, Doris is Poseidon's mother-in-law.

00:32:42.500 --> 00:32:47.060
 Do you want to, when you say an oceanid, as if that's just a word that we casually use

00:32:47.060 --> 00:32:48.060
 in day to day life?

00:32:48.060 --> 00:32:49.060
 Yeah.

00:32:49.060 --> 00:32:50.060
 I should explain what it is.

00:32:50.060 --> 00:32:53.540
 An oceanid is like a cryptid, cryptid being yetis and stuff.

00:32:53.540 --> 00:32:57.540
 An oceanid is a specific god of the ocean.

00:32:57.540 --> 00:32:58.540
 Is that right?

00:32:58.540 --> 00:33:01.820
 Oceanid, maybe, I don't know.

00:33:01.820 --> 00:33:02.820
 Oh yeah, maybe.

00:33:02.820 --> 00:33:03.820
 Oceanid.

00:33:03.820 --> 00:33:07.740
 All the ancient Greeks are dead, so no one is going to write this in great terms.

00:33:07.740 --> 00:33:09.460
 But yeah, I just love that as a...

00:33:09.460 --> 00:33:10.660
 Poseidon's mother-in-law.

00:33:10.660 --> 00:33:11.660
 Yeah.

00:33:11.660 --> 00:33:15.100
 So she's associated with a lot of very famous names that you would know if you know basic

00:33:15.100 --> 00:33:16.100
 Greek godology.

00:33:16.100 --> 00:33:20.260
 That I am certain is not a word.

00:33:20.260 --> 00:33:24.300
 I think we should just apologise now for all our pronunciations for everything for

00:33:24.300 --> 00:33:29.260
 the last four years, but especially for the next four years, yeah.

00:33:29.260 --> 00:33:35.100
 Doric is a Greek word, obviously mostly famous for Doric architecture, so everyone knows

00:33:35.100 --> 00:33:36.260
 that I spot a Doric column.

00:33:36.260 --> 00:33:37.260
 I feel like...

00:33:37.260 --> 00:33:38.260
 I feel like...

00:33:38.260 --> 00:33:39.260
 Oh yeah.

00:33:39.260 --> 00:33:42.740
 So there was an area called Doris, which is where the Doric architecture was from, which

00:33:42.740 --> 00:33:43.740
 I...

00:33:43.740 --> 00:33:44.740
 Yeah.

00:33:44.740 --> 00:33:47.020
 Can you tell us how to recognise a Doric column?

00:33:47.020 --> 00:33:48.020
 I don't know how to do that.

00:33:48.020 --> 00:33:49.020
 I always...

00:33:49.020 --> 00:33:50.260
 I'm going to get it wrong.

00:33:50.260 --> 00:33:55.700
 I always thought it was the ones, so they're wider at the bottom than at the top, which

00:33:55.700 --> 00:33:58.180
 often you don't notice that, because it's further away at the top anyway.

00:33:58.180 --> 00:33:59.180
 Got it.

00:33:59.180 --> 00:34:02.220
 And they've got those little grooves in them, so you know columns that have grooves.

00:34:02.220 --> 00:34:03.220
 Yeah.

00:34:03.220 --> 00:34:04.220
 So they're quite plain.

00:34:04.220 --> 00:34:06.980
 What's really funny is that you and I are discussing this, and I'm the actually known.

00:34:06.980 --> 00:34:08.500
 And I'm absolutely trying to get it.

00:34:08.500 --> 00:34:10.540
 I'm actually trying to get it.

00:34:10.540 --> 00:34:11.540
 No, I don't know.

00:34:11.540 --> 00:34:12.540
 We've got time.

00:34:12.540 --> 00:34:13.540
 Right, guys.

00:34:13.540 --> 00:34:14.540
 Okay.

00:34:14.540 --> 00:34:15.540
 Basically Doric is the absolute vanilla of columns.

00:34:15.540 --> 00:34:16.540
 It's also got the grooves.

00:34:16.540 --> 00:34:18.140
 It's got a couple of round bands at the top.

00:34:18.140 --> 00:34:19.140
 Nothing fancy.

00:34:19.140 --> 00:34:23.820
 Doric's ionic, which has got the curly scrolls, and then Corinthian are the crazy, crazy

00:34:23.820 --> 00:34:27.140
 ones, which have got flowers and bursting pineapples at the top.

00:34:27.140 --> 00:34:28.140
 Those are the really fancy ones.

00:34:28.140 --> 00:34:29.140
 Right?

00:34:29.140 --> 00:34:31.980
 Then you get some composite ones as well, but we don't have time for that.

00:34:31.980 --> 00:34:32.980
 No, please.

00:34:32.980 --> 00:34:34.580
 No, no, no.

00:34:34.580 --> 00:34:35.580
 No.

00:34:35.580 --> 00:34:40.460
 Doric felt like she was the god of the kind of rubbishy part of the ocean.

00:34:40.460 --> 00:34:45.500
 So she was specifically the god of the mouth of rivers where the freshwater mingles with

00:34:45.500 --> 00:34:48.820
 the brine, and it gets really briny and salty.

00:34:48.820 --> 00:34:52.660
 So she was really just that specific part that she managed, and she represented the fertility

00:34:52.660 --> 00:34:53.660
 of the sea.

00:34:53.660 --> 00:34:54.660
 That's quite a good bit, I think.

00:34:54.660 --> 00:34:55.660
 Yeah.

00:34:55.660 --> 00:34:56.660
 It was a fishing ground.

00:34:56.660 --> 00:34:59.540
 So if you were into fishing, it was like mungrobes and stuff like that, right?

00:34:59.540 --> 00:35:00.540
 Yeah.

00:35:00.540 --> 00:35:04.260
 It does feel a bit like she was at the back of the queue when the bits of the ocean were

00:35:04.260 --> 00:35:06.060
 being handed out to all the gods.

00:35:06.060 --> 00:35:09.420
 There was a god called Akkalaus, who was the patron god of the Akkalaus River, and that

00:35:09.420 --> 00:35:11.740
 was the largest river in ancient Greece, so that was quite important.

00:35:11.740 --> 00:35:15.300
 But I like the thing about him was that he created the river by crying.

00:35:15.300 --> 00:35:26.580
 He was the Justin Timberlake of his time, wasn't he?

00:35:26.580 --> 00:35:29.940
 There were still loads of things to date that are named after the gods.

00:35:29.940 --> 00:35:34.860
 So there was one article, you know quartz.com, who's a really good, there was an article all

00:35:34.860 --> 00:35:38.220
 about hedge funds which are named after the gods.

00:35:38.220 --> 00:35:42.660
 And it did mention an analysis, which found that if you add a word which conveys gravitas

00:35:42.660 --> 00:35:48.780
 to the name of your big financial body, likes use or aries or Poseidon or the Roman equivalents.

00:35:48.780 --> 00:35:49.780
 Oh, Doris.

00:35:49.780 --> 00:35:53.100
 Oh, I'm not sure about Doris, that is a thing.

00:35:53.100 --> 00:35:58.460
 If you add a gravitas word, it adds $250,000 of income each year.

00:35:58.460 --> 00:35:59.460
 Wow.

00:35:59.460 --> 00:36:05.100
 But it also pointed out that almost all of these names are really badly chosen.

00:36:05.100 --> 00:36:06.900
 So Hermes is chosen for loads of them.

00:36:06.900 --> 00:36:09.220
 He was the god of swindlers.

00:36:09.220 --> 00:36:13.940
 There's Medea who murdered her ex-boyfriend's sons, there's Icarus who famously flies

00:36:13.940 --> 00:36:17.260
 too high and then crashes into the ocean.

00:36:17.260 --> 00:36:20.420
 And then there's Tantlers who is good because he's wealthy.

00:36:20.420 --> 00:36:24.780
 But he also, when the gods visited him, he killed his own son and roasted him to impress

00:36:24.780 --> 00:36:25.780
 the gods.

00:36:25.780 --> 00:36:28.340
 So they punished him to eternal hunger and thirst.

00:36:28.340 --> 00:36:30.980
 But they all have the odd skeleton in their closet, don't they?

00:36:30.980 --> 00:36:31.980
 These gods.

00:36:31.980 --> 00:36:32.980
 That's true.

00:36:32.980 --> 00:36:33.980
 You know, they often do good stuff.

00:36:33.980 --> 00:36:36.260
 But then they, you know, eat their children or whatever.

00:36:36.260 --> 00:36:38.260
 But there's always something for all of you.

00:36:38.260 --> 00:36:44.900
 These are the weird things I do to impress someone who's roasted and eat your own son.

00:36:44.900 --> 00:36:50.860
 Just on names, I found that the eldest cyclops of Gaia was called Bronte.

00:36:50.860 --> 00:36:54.340
 And Bronte was for the thunder, god of the thunder.

00:36:54.340 --> 00:37:00.500
 So you've got the Brontosaurus or thunder lizard, which gets its name from the Bronte.

00:37:00.500 --> 00:37:01.500
 There's a theory.

00:37:01.500 --> 00:37:04.460
 Now I'm getting this from Stephen Fry's mythos book.

00:37:04.460 --> 00:37:07.740
 And so this is a footnote, which is a theory he's putting forward that someone has come

00:37:07.740 --> 00:37:15.180
 up with, the Bronte sisters are actually named after this Greek god, Bronte.

00:37:15.180 --> 00:37:21.100
 And it's because their father was born Bronte, B-R-U-N-T-Y, but changed it to Bronte, either

00:37:21.100 --> 00:37:26.620
 as a tribute to the classical Greek god or in honor of Admiral Nelson, who was made

00:37:26.620 --> 00:37:28.420
 the Duke of Bronte.

00:37:28.420 --> 00:37:31.300
 And that dukedom was located on the slopes of Etna.

00:37:31.300 --> 00:37:34.420
 And that was believed to have been derived from the cyclops named Bronte.

00:37:34.420 --> 00:37:38.820
 So the Bronte sisters are possibly a tribute name to a Greek god.

00:37:38.820 --> 00:37:40.140
 That's very cool.

00:37:40.140 --> 00:37:41.540
 That's pretty cool, eh?

00:37:41.540 --> 00:37:46.500
 Some more gods from that big list on Wikipedia of gods.

00:37:46.500 --> 00:37:49.780
 Chiamites is the demigod of the bean.

00:37:49.780 --> 00:37:54.820
 Wow, not even the god of the bean, out.

00:37:54.820 --> 00:38:01.420
 Accratopotes is the god of unmixed wine and incontinence.

00:38:01.420 --> 00:38:06.060
 And Harpocrates, I quite like him, he is the god of silence.

00:38:06.060 --> 00:38:12.660
 And a lot of people thought that Harpo Marx got his name because he was always silent.

00:38:12.660 --> 00:38:14.780
 But actually he got his name because he played the harp.

00:38:14.780 --> 00:38:15.780
 He played the harp.

00:38:15.780 --> 00:38:17.780
 It's just a coincidence.

00:38:17.780 --> 00:38:25.020
 There was a god called Anna Idea and the Anna Idea was a spirit of ruthlessness.

00:38:25.020 --> 00:38:26.020
 Yeah, yeah.

00:38:26.020 --> 00:38:27.020
 I can do that.

00:38:27.020 --> 00:38:29.700
 Shamelessness and unforgivingness.

00:38:29.700 --> 00:38:32.780
 Oh, that does sound a bit harsh.

00:38:32.780 --> 00:38:37.300
 Have you, you know, Kardea, who's the Roman goddess of door hinges?

00:38:37.300 --> 00:38:38.300
 Cool.

00:38:38.300 --> 00:38:39.780
 Quite a, quite a low-rung.

00:38:39.780 --> 00:38:40.780
 Well, no, it's interesting.

00:38:40.780 --> 00:38:43.300
 I wouldn't have known they had hinges back then.

00:38:43.300 --> 00:38:45.700
 I didn't think the doors opened because they had doors.

00:38:45.700 --> 00:38:46.700
 Okay.

00:38:46.700 --> 00:38:48.820
 Well done Greeks.

00:38:48.820 --> 00:38:50.300
 There was Roman.

00:38:50.300 --> 00:38:51.300
 I was Roman.

00:38:51.300 --> 00:38:52.300
 Sorry, Roman.

00:38:52.300 --> 00:38:53.300
 He was Roman, yeah.

00:38:53.300 --> 00:38:54.620
 I think also the Greeks might have had hinges on doors.

00:38:54.620 --> 00:38:55.620
 We don't know that.

00:38:55.620 --> 00:39:01.020
 It's so annoying because I can't prove to you that we do know that in the moment.

00:39:01.020 --> 00:39:02.020
 I think we do know that.

00:39:02.020 --> 00:39:04.740
 That must be annoying.

00:39:04.740 --> 00:39:06.820
 There are still people who worship the ancient Greek gods.

00:39:06.820 --> 00:39:07.820
 Not many.

00:39:07.820 --> 00:39:08.820
 No.

00:39:08.820 --> 00:39:09.820
 I'll say that.

00:39:09.820 --> 00:39:14.540
 But in Greece, in 2006, a court in Athens officially unbanned their worship, but only about

00:39:14.540 --> 00:39:15.940
 2000 worshipers.

00:39:15.940 --> 00:39:20.300
 And the story in the Guardian quoted a Christian priest in Greece who said, "They are a handful

00:39:20.300 --> 00:39:25.220
 of miserable resuscitators of a degenerate dead religion who wish to return to the monstrous

00:39:25.220 --> 00:39:27.660
 dark delusions of the past."

00:39:27.660 --> 00:39:30.460
 That's harsh for what is just a bunch of harmless excents, isn't it?

00:39:30.460 --> 00:39:31.460
 I think so.

00:39:31.460 --> 00:39:32.460
 Yeah.

00:39:32.460 --> 00:39:33.460
 Do you know the word atheists?

00:39:33.460 --> 00:39:37.940
 Where we get atheism comes from without God or God forsaken or abandoned by God?

00:39:37.940 --> 00:39:40.500
 That's what it originally meant.

00:39:40.500 --> 00:39:42.180
 And we got the word from the French.

00:39:42.180 --> 00:39:45.660
 And in English, it predates the word "theism" by over 100 years.

00:39:45.660 --> 00:39:49.020
 So atheism was the first thing, and then we got theism afterwards.

00:39:49.020 --> 00:39:50.020
 Oh, no.

00:39:50.020 --> 00:39:51.020
 That was interesting.

00:39:51.020 --> 00:39:52.020
 That is interesting.

00:39:52.020 --> 00:39:55.220
 It's absolutely opposite of what I thought would have been.

00:39:55.220 --> 00:39:59.060
 I think that's why, you know, I think that's why I mentioned it.

00:39:59.060 --> 00:40:02.820
 If all my facts were exactly what you felt they were going to be, then this would be a

00:40:02.820 --> 00:40:03.820
 very barry podcast.

00:40:03.820 --> 00:40:09.460
 Well, maybe you've finally said something I didn't know you said.

00:40:09.460 --> 00:40:14.060
 Okay, that is it.

00:40:14.060 --> 00:40:15.220
 That is all of our facts.

00:40:15.220 --> 00:40:17.060
