00:00:17,00:00:20,"Hello, and welcome to another episode of no such thing as a fish, a weekly podcast"
00:00:20,00:00:23,coming to you from the QI offices in Covert Garden.
00:00:23,00:00:28,"My name is Dan Schreiber, I am sitting here with James Harkin, Anna Chazinski, and Andrew"
00:00:28,00:00:33,"Hunch and Murray, and once again we have gathered around the microphones with our four favorite"
00:00:33,00:00:37,"facts from the last seven days, and in no particular order, here we go."
00:00:37,00:00:39,"Starting with you, James."
00:00:39,00:00:45,"Okay, my fact this week is that due to climate change, nine out of the 21 cities that have"
00:00:45,00:00:50,hosted the Winter Olympics will be too warm to do so by 2050.
00:00:50,00:00:54,"I was glad to see that you put climate change in air quotes there, James, just for the"
00:00:54,00:00:59,"second. It's so cold, climate change. Yeah, sure they will."
00:00:59,00:01:04,"I did not do that to people at home, I wouldn't do that, but this is about the Winter Olympics"
00:01:04,00:01:08,and I'm really excited because the opening ceremony is happening now as we're doing this
00:01:08,00:01:09,podcast.
00:01:09,00:01:10,Is it really?
00:01:10,00:01:11,Just right now.
00:01:11,00:01:14,"And by the time this goes out it will be one week into the Olympics, and Britain will"
00:01:14,00:01:16,"be top of the medals chart, probably."
00:01:16,00:01:17,Wow.
00:01:17,00:01:21,"I've heard things about Australia having a good year, so."
00:01:21,00:01:22,Are they?
00:01:22,00:01:23,Have you got a lot of snow in Australia?
00:01:23,00:01:29,"No, but apparently nowhere does any more, so it's actually playing to our favour."
00:01:29,00:01:32,"Just on who's going to be where are the medals charts, there's a guy from Tonga."
00:01:32,00:01:33,Is there?
00:01:33,00:01:34,A head of him?
00:01:34,00:01:35,No.
00:01:35,00:01:36,He's really good.
00:01:36,00:01:39,"His name, and I hope I pronounce it right, is Peter Talfa Tafua, and he tried to learn"
00:01:39,00:01:40,cross-country skiing in a year.
00:01:40,00:01:44,He's the only Tonga athlete ever to have been in the summer and the Winter Olympics.
00:01:44,00:01:45,Wow.
00:01:45,00:01:48,He did all his training on roller skis and paved roads.
00:01:48,00:01:52,He's basically a one-man cool runnings.
00:01:52,00:01:53,He hates it as well.
00:01:53,00:01:54,He's the other thing.
00:01:54,00:01:57,"He said, ""Every time I ski, I feel like I die a little inside."
00:01:57,00:02:01,"I still haven't had a race where I felt completely happy."""
00:02:01,00:02:02,"Oh, no."
00:02:02,00:02:07,"So, even though this, you know, the climate is going to warm, and it's going to be all ruined"
00:02:07,00:02:11,"by 2050, at the moment, everyone's really whining about how cold it is, aren't they?"
00:02:11,00:02:16,"In Pyongchang, apparently, it's really absolutely freezing, but to an extent, the people don't"
00:02:16,00:02:20,"really like, so I think it's meant to be about -10, but the windshield factor there, because"
00:02:20,00:02:24,"it's so windy, brings it down to -25."
00:02:24,00:02:28,"And they're all tweeting that they can't do anything, and the Australian Olympic athlete"
00:02:28,00:02:32,"called Lydia Lassiller was asked to be flag bearer in the ceremony, and she said, ""It's"
00:02:32,00:02:33,too cold.
00:02:33,00:02:34,It's bad for my knees.
00:02:34,00:02:36,"I'm not going to be flag bearer for my country, sorry."""
00:02:36,00:02:37,Wow.
00:02:37,00:02:38,Is she going at all?
00:02:38,00:02:39,"Yeah, yeah, she's going, but she's the same."
00:02:39,00:02:42,"Of course you think, if you go to the Winter Olympics, you should know what you're letting"
00:02:42,00:02:44,"yourself in for, which is that it's going to be cold."
00:02:44,00:02:45,Just wear an extra jumper.
00:02:45,00:02:46,"You wear an extra jumper, yeah."
00:02:46,00:02:47,Maybe bring some gloves.
00:02:47,00:02:48,I have no sympathy.
00:02:48,00:02:55,"Pyeongchang is 700 meters above sea level, and they call that the Happy 700, and they say that"
00:02:55,00:02:58,it's the optimal altitude for humans and animals to live.
00:02:58,00:02:59,Really?
00:02:59,00:03:00,Apparently.
00:03:00,00:03:01,It is.
00:03:01,00:03:04,It is the coldest place on Earth for its altitude.
00:03:04,00:03:05,Is that right?
00:03:05,00:03:06,Yeah.
00:03:06,00:03:07,Wow.
00:03:07,00:03:10,"And I think it's kind of too cold for it, it doesn't snow very much, so it's very dry,"
00:03:10,00:03:12,"and it's mostly using fake snow, I think."
00:03:12,00:03:14,"Well, this guy from Tonga is going to be right at home, isn't he?"
00:03:14,00:03:17,He's going to be the other guy who could do it.
00:03:17,00:03:19,"Yeah, they stockpile fake snow."
00:03:19,00:03:20,Yeah.
00:03:20,00:03:23,"So, in Sachi, when Sachi had the Winter Olympics, it was quite warm there."
00:03:23,00:03:27,"They had the opposite problem to what they have now, and they stockpiled 60 million cubic"
00:03:27,00:03:32,feet of snow just so that they could layer it properly and beat the ski on it.
00:03:32,00:03:35,Sachi is definitely one of these that will be too warm by 2015.
00:03:35,00:03:36,That is probably too warm now.
00:03:36,00:03:37,Wow.
00:03:37,00:03:38,It was probably too warm when it happened.
00:03:38,00:03:39,I think you're right.
00:03:39,00:03:43,"Well, have you seen all the reports of the 2022 Olympics, the Winter Olympics?"
00:03:43,00:03:48,"This is in Beijing, so Beijing won it, and the photos that they showed of dead in the middle"
00:03:48,00:03:52,"of their winter was of the mountain range where it's going to be taking place, and it's"
00:03:52,00:03:53,just green.
00:03:53,00:03:54,A whole thing.
00:03:54,00:03:55,There's just no snow at all.
00:03:55,00:04:02,"And so they're going to be using a lot of fake snow as well, and they won it off Almaty,"
00:04:02,00:04:08,"which is Kazakhstan, or yeah, Almaty and Kazakhstan, and they're slogan to rub it in was keeping"
00:04:08,00:04:12,"it real, because they were like, we've actually got snow for this winter Olympics, and they"
00:04:12,00:04:13,still lost.
00:04:13,00:04:21,"Do you know, in 1960, for the 1960 Winter Olympics, one of the cities that BED was Karachi in Pakistan?"
00:04:21,00:04:22,Wow.
00:04:22,00:04:24,"But do you have Himalayas there, I guess?"
00:04:24,00:04:26,"Not in Karachi, actually."
00:04:26,00:04:30,"They do have it in the north of the country, but they don't have it there."
00:04:30,00:04:33,They have no traditions of any winter sports.
00:04:33,00:04:37,"It's a tropical city on the Arabian Sea, and the coldest temperature, it has ever had"
00:04:37,00:04:43,"that it's entire history, is zero degrees, never, ever gone below zero."
00:04:43,00:04:44,Wow.
00:04:44,00:04:45,They didn't win.
00:04:45,00:04:49,"That's the thing about China, though, is that there's no tradition of skiing there, and"
00:04:49,00:04:53,"as a result, China has, with classic Chinese efficiency, just said, right, everyone is going"
00:04:53,00:04:54,to learn to ski now.
00:04:54,00:04:59,"So they've created 800 ski results, and they want, in the next four years, to get 300"
00:04:59,00:05:01,million people skiing.
00:05:01,00:05:07,"Do your China has more statues of footballers, soccer players than any other country apart from"
00:05:07,00:05:08,Britain?
00:05:08,00:05:09,Does it really?
00:05:09,00:05:10,"Yeah, just of Chinese footballers, or?"
00:05:10,00:05:12,I think they're mostly not Chinese footballers.
00:05:12,00:05:14,"Yeah, there'll be many British ones going to it."
00:05:14,00:05:16,"Or Europeans, yeah, or Brazilians."
00:05:16,00:05:18,Why do they do that?
00:05:18,00:05:22,"Because they like statues, and they like football."
00:05:22,00:05:23,Fair enough.
00:05:23,00:05:27,"So they've taken story things, story checks out."
00:05:27,00:05:32,Did you hear about the Norwegian team at the Winter Olympics this year?
00:05:32,00:05:33,No.
00:05:33,00:05:34,No.
00:05:34,00:05:35,"Every team, apparently, I didn't know this."
00:05:35,00:05:37,They take their own chefs to cook for you.
00:05:37,00:05:42,And the Norwegian team chefs ordered for the team's feeding for the next fortnight.
00:05:42,00:05:44,1500 eggs from a Korean delivery service.
00:05:44,00:05:50,"Unfortunately, they made a slight mistake in translation, and they got 15,000 eggs delivered"
00:05:50,00:05:51,to them.
00:05:51,00:05:52,Wow.
00:05:52,00:05:53,Yeah.
00:05:53,00:05:54,I've done that on a cardo before.
00:05:54,00:05:58,"They said, yeah, the truck arrived, and they just kept bringing eggs in."
00:05:58,00:06:00,"And basically, they got half a lorry full of eggs."
00:06:00,00:06:02,What are they going to do with them?
00:06:02,00:06:06,"Well, what's funny is, I did find this story, actually, and there's a quote where everyone's"
00:06:06,00:06:09,"trying to make a massive story out of it, but all the quotes that they come back with,"
00:06:09,00:06:11,"they're just like, look, they'll probably use them, I guess."
00:06:11,00:06:12,I don't know.
00:06:12,00:06:13,Maybe the people that supplied them will take them back.
00:06:13,00:06:14,I don't know.
00:06:14,00:06:15,It's not a big issue.
00:06:15,00:06:16,No one cares.
00:06:16,00:06:19,It's not going to give us something.
00:06:19,00:06:23,"I bet the people who had to heave the eggs all the way inside, and then were told"
00:06:23,00:06:24,to remove them again.
00:06:24,00:06:25,Care quite a lot.
00:06:25,00:06:27,"Yeah, Dan, that's a big story for those guys."
00:06:27,00:06:33,I think about the poor delivery guys.
00:06:33,00:06:40,"I was looking into sports at the Winter Olympics that no longer exist, because I remember"
00:06:40,00:06:45,"ages ago, we did an actual Summer Olympics episode, and we found some things that used"
00:06:45,00:06:46,to be a part of it.
00:06:46,00:06:48,There's quite a few good ones as well on this.
00:06:48,00:06:51,They used to do figure skating on skis today.
00:06:51,00:06:52,Yeah.
00:06:52,00:06:55,"It was like ski ballet, I think."
00:06:55,00:07:00,"It was either nicknamed or officially called, and so you could use the poles of the cross-country"
00:07:00,00:07:07,"skiing poles to do flips and so on, and it featured into Winter Olympics, but no longer"
00:07:07,00:07:08,done.
00:07:08,00:07:09,Yeah.
00:07:09,00:07:11,They used to have a medal for mountain climbing.
00:07:11,00:07:12,Did they?
00:07:12,00:07:15,"Well, they once had an award given out for mountain climbers, at the end of the very first"
00:07:15,00:07:16,Winter Olympics.
00:07:16,00:07:19,"Pierre Coubertin, the father of the Olympics."
00:07:19,00:07:24,"He gave out a medal for Alpinisma, which is mountaineering, to Charles Granville Bruce,"
00:07:24,00:07:28,"and he had led an expedition to Mount Everest two years before, and it was to say, ""Good"
00:07:28,00:07:29,"on you."""
00:07:29,00:07:30,All right.
00:07:30,00:07:31,"It was to say ""Good on you"" for the Everest thing."
00:07:31,00:07:33,It wasn't actually because he'd won mountain climbing in that.
00:07:33,00:07:34,But Wooden Tournament.
00:07:34,00:07:36,"That guy didn't make it to the top of Everest, did he?"
00:07:36,00:07:37,He did not.
00:07:37,00:07:38,"So, why did he get a medal?"
00:07:38,00:07:39,"Well, he tried."
00:07:39,00:07:40,It was a consolation prize.
00:07:40,00:07:41,Yeah.
00:07:41,00:07:42,Okay.
00:07:42,00:07:43,"What was his name, sorry?"
00:07:43,00:07:44,Charles Granville Bruce.
00:07:44,00:07:45,"Right, okay."
00:07:45,00:07:52,"The ski drawing used to be a thing, didn't it? It was in the 1928 Olympics in Samarits,"
00:07:52,00:07:55,and it's dog-pulled sledding.
00:07:55,00:07:56,Yes.
00:07:56,00:07:58,Where the dogs basically compete on your behalf.
00:07:58,00:07:59,I don't really know why we don't still do this.
00:07:59,00:08:03,"It seems great, and it's a commonly done thing across kind of Northern Scandinavia."
00:08:03,00:08:04,It wasn't just dogs.
00:08:04,00:08:05,It was horses.
00:08:05,00:08:06,You could be pulled by horses.
00:08:06,00:08:07,Yeah.
00:08:07,00:08:08,Would you have dogs against horses?
00:08:08,00:08:09,I don't know.
00:08:09,00:08:10,Can you find that out?
00:08:10,00:08:11,Did you manage to find that out?
00:08:11,00:08:12,I think you've got to assume that you couldn't.
00:08:12,00:08:13,No.
00:08:13,00:08:14,You could have those.
00:08:14,00:08:15,One of those is going to be better than the other.
00:08:15,00:08:16,"Yeah, exactly."
00:08:16,00:08:19,"Hey, whichever one's better, you wouldn't choose the other one."
00:08:19,00:08:22,"But it only appeared once, and both horses and dogs competed."
00:08:22,00:08:23,So did they do separate races?
00:08:23,00:08:24,Was that the dog race?
00:08:24,00:08:29,"You could calculate how many dogs equaled one horse, and then have a rough rule of thumb"
00:08:29,00:08:30,for that.
00:08:30,00:08:31,Because some horses are better than other horses.
00:08:31,00:08:35,"Yeah, you could have set them ponies against greyhounds, and then, actually, that would"
00:08:35,00:08:36,probably even out.
00:08:36,00:08:38,I don't think greyhounds are strong enough.
00:08:38,00:08:40,What if you had 200 greyhounds?
00:08:40,00:08:43,It's very hard to fit them on the podium.
00:08:43,00:08:45,I think it's quite important what you've been doing afterwards.
00:08:45,00:08:47,But then could you just do that with any animals?
00:08:47,00:08:52,"Like with, you know, 5,000 snails off, half an elephant."
00:08:52,00:08:53,Yeah.
00:08:53,00:08:54,Half an elephant.
00:08:54,00:09:01,"James, you've come to regret your half an elephant choice, I think."
00:09:01,00:09:05,Have you guys heard of the ice masters?
00:09:05,00:09:06,No.
00:09:06,00:09:07,They're real people.
00:09:07,00:09:11,And they control the snow and the ice for winter Olympic games.
00:09:11,00:09:12,Okay.
00:09:12,00:09:15,But there's an amazing article about them in the Smithsonian.
00:09:15,00:09:19,"And before the games, they will spray onto, like, the bobsled tracks, for example, hundreds"
00:09:19,00:09:22,of paper thin coats of ultra-purified water.
00:09:22,00:09:27,"So it makes it completely smooth, so there are no bubbles, there are no impurities."
00:09:27,00:09:30,Because you can't just send a zamboni down the loose track.
00:09:30,00:09:31,And you can't just...
00:09:31,00:09:32,You can't zamboni it.
00:09:32,00:09:35,So you can't cheat in the loose.
00:09:35,00:09:39,And the way that people have cheated in the loose before is by heasing their sleds.
00:09:39,00:09:44,"So in 1968, the East German women's team heated the bottom of their sleds, and so that slightly"
00:09:44,00:09:47,"melts the snow as you're going down, and it reduces friction."
00:09:47,00:09:48,Wow.
00:09:48,00:09:50,"But it used to be legal, I think, in the very earliest games."
00:09:50,00:09:51,It was unorthodox.
00:09:51,00:09:53,"People would call you a maverick, but it wasn't explicitly banned."
00:09:53,00:09:54,Is that right?
00:09:54,00:09:55,Yeah.
00:09:55,00:09:58,"Do you know, in golf, you're allowed to heat your balls before the game starts, but you're"
00:09:58,00:10:01,not allowed to artificially heat them during the round.
00:10:01,00:10:04,What was the advantage of heating your balls in golf?
00:10:04,00:10:07,"Well, you know, they just stick to your thighs left, I guess, though."
00:10:07,00:10:11,Stick to your thighs.
00:10:11,00:10:12,Wow.
00:10:12,00:10:13,That was an issue.
00:10:13,00:10:20,Turned does a lot of nude golfing.
00:10:20,00:10:21,They might fly further.
00:10:21,00:10:22,I don't know.
00:10:22,00:10:26,"I don't think anyone actually does this, but it is technically legal."
00:10:26,00:10:31,"What qualifies as artificially heasing them, if they're just in your pocket?"
00:10:31,00:10:32,That's fine.
00:10:32,00:10:36,Could you tuck them in your armpit?
00:10:36,00:10:38,"It would mess with your stroke, wouldn't it?"
00:10:38,00:10:39,"Yeah, it would."
00:10:39,00:10:41,But your caddy could tuck them in his armpit.
00:10:41,00:10:42,Yeah.
00:10:42,00:10:45,The US have heated jackets this year.
00:10:45,00:10:49,"Yeah, Ralph Lauren have designed their jackets, and they've got this super high tech design"
00:10:49,00:10:54,"where they contain apparently electronic conductive inks, which are printed inside their"
00:10:54,00:10:58,"jacket in the shape of the American flag, and they're attached to a battery pack."
00:10:58,00:11:02,And so it means that all the US competitors doing drill and fix the room artificially
00:11:02,00:11:03,heat it.
00:11:03,00:11:10,"He don't wish harm on anyone, but I really, if those batteries do happen to overheat the"
00:11:10,00:11:11,satellite.
00:11:11,00:11:17,"Oh, imagine just having a massive American flag stars and stripes tattoo on your bag."
00:11:17,00:11:18,What happened?
00:11:18,00:11:19,Ralph Lauren happened.
00:11:19,00:11:20,Yeah.
00:11:20,00:11:22,"That's quite nice though, because if everyone's outside having a cigarette, can everyone"
00:11:22,00:11:25,just gather around the Americans to get heat off them?
00:11:25,00:11:33,I'm not sure during the Winter Olympics everyone goes outside for a cigarette.
00:11:33,00:11:40,"You know Eddie the Eagle, our British celebrity who competed in the 1988 Olympics for anyone"
00:11:40,00:11:45,"who doesn't know, and he was the only ski jumper to have competed for the UK, and he was"
00:11:45,00:11:46,terrible.
00:11:46,00:11:49,He meant they had to change the rules of the Olympics to make sure such terrible people
00:11:49,00:11:51,couldn't qualify in future.
00:11:51,00:11:55,"But he was a plasterer when he entered, and he still works as a plasterer in Stroud."
00:11:55,00:11:56,Cool.
00:11:56,00:11:57,Which I just find so weird.
00:11:57,00:12:00,He's such a known name to everyone in Britain.
00:12:00,00:12:03,He's just hanging out in Stroud being a plasterer.
00:12:03,00:12:08,"Must be weird to have a life where you're just a plasterer all the time, and then just for"
00:12:08,00:12:12,"two months, you're the most famous person in the whole of Britain, and you go to the Olympics"
00:12:12,00:12:13,and then you were plasterer again.
00:12:13,00:12:14,So was that.
00:12:14,00:12:17,"So when they made that movie of him, do you think he arrived at the cinema thinking, finally,"
00:12:17,00:12:20,my plastering career is going to see it.
00:12:20,00:12:21,"Oh, what?"
00:12:21,00:12:22,They picked that one.
00:12:22,00:12:23,A fan?
00:12:23,00:12:31,"OK, there's time for fact number two, and that is Chazinski."
00:12:31,00:12:37,"My fact this week is that Canada has a strategic maple syrup reserve, and in 2012, a quarter"
00:12:37,00:12:40,of the maple syrup in it was stolen.
00:12:40,00:12:41,And I love this.
00:12:41,00:12:47,"I only just found out about this, but this is in Quebec, so Canada tapped 75% at least"
00:12:47,00:12:49,of the global supply of maple syrup.
00:12:49,00:12:51,And so it provides a lot of jobs for people.
00:12:51,00:12:55,"And so in the same way that there needs to be an oil reserve in the US, because the fluctuations"
00:12:55,00:13:00,"in the market, or if the maple trees suddenly die or whatever in Canada, they have a massive"
00:13:00,00:13:05,"reserve, so that the prices can stay stable and so that the supply can stay stable."
00:13:05,00:13:07,Stable or artificially high?
00:13:07,00:13:08,Or artificially high.
00:13:08,00:13:13,"If you believe the whole cartel, this is a mafia kind of argument, which some do."
00:13:13,00:13:14,Some do.
00:13:14,00:13:15,I don't.
00:13:15,00:13:16,"No, no."
00:13:16,00:13:17,You wouldn't want to get in trouble with those guys.
00:13:17,00:13:23,This was the largest theft ever investigated by Quebec police in their entire history.
00:13:23,00:13:26,"That's kind of nice that it got to be something, a local product, isn't it?"
00:13:26,00:13:27,Yeah.
00:13:27,00:13:28,Yeah.
00:13:28,00:13:29,Yeah.
00:13:29,00:13:32,"It was $30 million worth was stolen, which I think was about 6,000 barrels."
00:13:32,00:13:33,"6,000 barrels."
00:13:33,00:13:39,It was enough maple syrup to put one tablespoon on 183 million flapjacks.
00:13:39,00:13:40,OK.
00:13:40,00:13:42,Would you put maple syrup on a flapjack?
00:13:42,00:13:46,"I think that maybe, now I read that, because I thought it said pancakes, and then I read"
00:13:46,00:13:47,"it, and it said flapjacks."
00:13:47,00:13:48,"So, there are two options here."
00:13:48,00:13:50,"One, I've written down the wrong word."
00:13:50,00:13:54,"More likely, I've copy-pasted that word, and the word flapjack means something different"
00:13:54,00:13:55,in colour.
00:13:55,00:13:56,Ah.
00:13:56,00:13:58,"Anyway, there are these guys."
00:13:58,00:14:04,"The federation-de-product-aerical de Quebec, which is, as you say, the syrup produces union."
00:14:04,00:14:05,"And basically, they do."
00:14:05,00:14:06,They run the whole show.
00:14:06,00:14:11,You're not legally allowed to sell maple syrup to anyone except them.
00:14:11,00:14:15,"And then they stockpile it, so that if the farmers have a really good year, buying"
00:14:15,00:14:18,"it, can't buy it really, really cheaply, and then screw the farmers over the next season."
00:14:18,00:14:21,"However, a lot of farmers want freedom to stop doing that."
00:14:21,00:14:25,"They do, because they can do things like, I didn't quite realise that this is how cartels"
00:14:25,00:14:30,"work, but the farmers don't get paid until the stockpilers have actually sold their syrup."
00:14:30,00:14:33,"So, if they just decide that there's been a lot of maple syrup made that year, so they're"
00:14:33,00:14:36,"not going to sell a very high proportion of it, then the farmers aren't going to get"
00:14:36,00:14:39,"paid for their maple syrup until it's gone out into the market, which does seem a bit"
00:14:39,00:14:40,frustrating.
00:14:40,00:14:46,"And haven't they done what happened in America in 2002, a farmer called Marvin Horn decided"
00:14:46,00:14:49,that he was not going to hand over his raisins anymore?
00:14:49,00:14:56,"So the government, since World War II, had been stockpiling excess raisins from farmers,"
00:14:56,00:15:01,"because the market was flooded, basically, with raisins, and they didn't know what to do."
00:15:01,00:15:07,So they stopped farmers had to give any extra raisins that they had just over to the government.
00:15:07,00:15:11,"And this guy, Marvin Horn, he said he wasn't going to hand them over anymore."
00:15:11,00:15:14,"The government sued him for $680,000, but he won the case in the end."
00:15:14,00:15:18,"Yeah, we won off to 13 years of grinding lawsuits in legal battles."
00:15:18,00:15:19,"I mean, I know."
00:15:19,00:15:21,"Well, doesn't everyone just do that?"
00:15:21,00:15:27,There just needs to be one tree sapon farmer who's going to spend 13 years for the cause
00:15:27,00:15:28,of maple syrup in Canada.
00:15:28,00:15:29,I guess.
00:15:29,00:15:31,I think no one really wants to be the first one to do that.
00:15:31,00:15:33,But the raisin reserve is unbelievable.
00:15:33,00:15:34,"Yeah, wow."
00:15:34,00:15:35,It's a real thing.
00:15:35,00:15:36,And it's still excess.
00:15:36,00:15:38,"They're not even sure if they're going to go back to doing it, because this lawsuit has"
00:15:38,00:15:42,"thrown up everything up in the air, and they might cancel it now."
00:15:42,00:15:43,Wow.
00:15:43,00:15:45,I can't believe there's been a massive raisin stockpile.
00:15:45,00:15:48,"Well, this is why this huge theft of all the maple syrup happened as well."
00:15:48,00:15:52,It's groups who are kind of objecting to this mafia-like hold they have over the market.
00:15:52,00:15:57,And it's discovered in July 2012 when they just did a routine check of this massive reserve.
00:15:57,00:16:00,"And they realised that one of the barrels kind of tipped over too easily, and they looked"
00:16:00,00:16:02,"inside it, and they realised it was empty."
00:16:02,00:16:07,And then they inspected all the barrels and so many loads of them were filled with water.
00:16:07,00:16:11,"And they realised that somehow someone had been siphoning out maple syrup, and they found"
00:16:11,00:16:16,"the people eventually who'd done it, and it turned out they'd hired some space out in"
00:16:16,00:16:20,"the big storage in the big warehouse, and they'd just been gradually siphoning the maple"
00:16:20,00:16:21,syrup out.
00:16:21,00:16:25,"So when you siphon petrol, you have to suck a little bit out, don't you?"
00:16:25,00:16:26,And then you spit it out of your mouth.
00:16:26,00:16:31,"I only know this from movies, and then you can siphon it by using the physics of siphons."
00:16:31,00:16:32,Yes.
00:16:32,00:16:34,And it's the same with maple syrup.
00:16:34,00:16:36,"And if so, would you spit it out, probably not?"
00:16:36,00:16:37,No.
00:16:37,00:16:39,"You spit it out, but only onto a nearby pancake."
00:16:39,00:16:40,Or flapjack.
00:16:40,00:16:41,Or flapjack.
00:16:41,00:16:48,"And the other thing is, once you steal all these barrels of maple syrup, what do you do?"
00:16:48,00:16:50,Is there like a black market of maple syrup?
00:16:50,00:16:51,Yes.
00:16:51,00:16:53,"A guy down the pub says, I've got a barrel here."
00:16:53,00:16:54,Yes.
00:16:54,00:16:55,There's a big black market.
00:16:55,00:16:56,That's what the rebels do.
00:16:56,00:17:00,"Yeah, the black market maple syrup dealing is an issue in Canada, and that's how people"
00:17:00,00:17:01,are getting around it.
00:17:01,00:17:02,So there are quite a few.
00:17:02,00:17:03,That's interesting.
00:17:03,00:17:08,"Apparently, the price of a barrel of maple syrup is around $2,000, 13 times the price"
00:17:08,00:17:09,of crude oil.
00:17:09,00:17:10,Wow.
00:17:10,00:17:12,So it's extremely expensive.
00:17:12,00:17:14,And tastier to suck out of a siphon?
00:17:14,00:17:18,"Yes, but less good for running a car."
00:17:18,00:17:19,Yep.
00:17:19,00:17:22,They both got their advantages and disadvantages.
00:17:22,00:17:24,It would be a boring world if we were all alike.
00:17:24,00:17:26,But here's a thing.
00:17:26,00:17:32,"If you are showing some pancakes or flapjacks on television for an advert, you want"
00:17:32,00:17:33,to put maple syrup on it.
00:17:33,00:17:38,They often use motor oil because it looks better on camera than maple syrup.
00:17:38,00:17:44,But what about the demonstrator lady who then has to start eating it?
00:17:44,00:17:45,You see her.
00:17:45,00:17:49,You see her take it and she shoves it into a car to exhaust the fire.
00:17:49,00:17:52,Is that what you do with your motor oil?
00:17:52,00:17:54,My car doesn't work.
00:17:54,00:17:59,It's really weird.
00:17:59,00:18:02,"So maple syrup, I didn't really know that you"
00:18:02,00:18:05,could just cut into the side of a tree and it just comes out.
00:18:05,00:18:06,Not any old tree.
00:18:06,00:18:07,A good point.
00:18:07,00:18:08,That has to be a maple tree.
00:18:08,00:18:09,Yes.
00:18:09,00:18:10,"With though, isn't it?"
00:18:10,00:18:11,Yeah.
00:18:11,00:18:15,It's because trees store it in their roots for winter and then they convert it to sugar.
00:18:15,00:18:18,They store starch and then they convert it to sugar and then that's the sap.
00:18:18,00:18:23,And then you have to concentrate it about 50 times because it just comes out as a much
00:18:23,00:18:25,thinner liquid.
00:18:25,00:18:28,And the Algonquian aborigines would concentrate it.
00:18:28,00:18:31,They would either drop a hot stone in so that boils off the liquid or they would
00:18:31,00:18:36,let the sap freeze overnight and then at the top all the water has turned to ice and you
00:18:36,00:18:37,just get rid of the ice.
00:18:37,00:18:38,Wow.
00:18:38,00:18:39,Concentrated maple syrup.
00:18:39,00:18:40,That's so cool.
00:18:40,00:18:41,Wow.
00:18:41,00:18:42,And then that's it.
00:18:42,00:18:43,That's just as good as.
00:18:43,00:18:46,I think you have to look quite a lot of times to get it because these days it's really
00:18:46,00:18:47,concentrated stuff.
00:18:47,00:18:48,Yeah.
00:18:48,00:18:49,It's 66% sugar.
00:18:49,00:18:52,"But you can only do it at certain times of the year, can't you?"
00:18:52,00:18:57,You can only do it when it's freezing during the night time and warm during the day.
00:18:57,00:19:02,So that's when the sap starts flowing up and down and that's when it will tap out.
00:19:02,00:19:06,And I think that's why the reserve is so important because it has these really specific conditions
00:19:06,00:19:09,that it flourishes in so it's really easy to have a bad season.
00:19:09,00:19:13,But they've invented this amazing new way of getting maple syrup out which is actually
00:19:13,00:19:17,going to increase the yield they think tenfold when they master it and it's vacuuming.
00:19:17,00:19:22,So what they've done is they've attached vacuum vacuums to these maple trees and then they
00:19:22,00:19:26,connect all the vacuums with a pipe and it sucks the syrup out.
00:19:26,00:19:30,"But it's incredible, it literally sucks the sugar almost straight up out of the ground."
00:19:30,00:19:33,So someone described it as being like a sugar straw.
00:19:33,00:19:37,So it basically is a way of sucking all the stuff out of the ground and then the tree turns
00:19:37,00:19:41,it kind of into the syrup that you want on the way up and then you can dump it in your
00:19:41,00:19:42,big bag.
00:19:42,00:19:43,It feels very unnatural that to me.
00:19:43,00:19:44,"It's not authentic, is it?"
00:19:44,00:19:45,No.
00:19:45,00:19:46,It feels sad for the tree.
00:19:46,00:19:47,It must be bad for something.
00:19:47,00:19:48,It must be bad for something.
00:19:48,00:19:49,Yeah.
00:19:49,00:19:50,"It doesn't sound sustainable, does it?"
00:19:50,00:19:53,Because the old method where you just drill a hole in and then people just hang
00:19:53,00:19:56,"plastic bags off, and it just drains down."
00:19:56,00:19:57,We just leave a bucket.
00:19:57,00:19:58,Or a bucket.
00:19:58,00:19:59,It's a leak.
00:19:59,00:20:01,"Does that feel natural to you, James?"
00:20:01,00:20:03,"Well, drilling..."
00:20:03,00:20:05,James just eats the tree.
00:20:05,00:20:09,"I think drilling is slightly unnatural, but I think attaching a massive vacuum cleaner"
00:20:09,00:20:11,to something is the next level.
00:20:11,00:20:12,You're right.
00:20:12,00:20:15,"Yeah, it's a few levels above, I would say."
00:20:15,00:20:22,"China has more than 200,000 tons of frozen pork."
00:20:22,00:20:26,"It's kind of hanging around, and that's because they do the same thing as Canada is doing with"
00:20:26,00:20:27,its maple syrup.
00:20:27,00:20:32,"So they have a strategic pork supply, and that's because they have more pigs than the next"
00:20:32,00:20:35,40 pork producing countries combined.
00:20:35,00:20:36,Next 40?
00:20:36,00:20:37,Yeah.
00:20:37,00:20:40,"And they're so massively dependent on this one commodity because loads, like some people"
00:20:40,00:20:46,"it's like 70% of the protein comes from pork, and so they need to keep the prices steady,"
00:20:46,00:20:49,and this is one of the best ways to keep prices steady.
00:20:49,00:20:51,"And they needed it actually in 2016, didn't they?"
00:20:51,00:20:52,They really had to draw on it.
00:20:52,00:20:54,"Yeah, they had a pork issue."
00:20:54,00:20:55,A pig issue.
00:20:55,00:20:56,What happened?
00:20:56,00:20:57,Pork coca lips.
00:20:57,00:20:58,Pork coca lips.
00:20:58,00:20:59,"Yeah, sure."
00:20:59,00:21:00,A pork coca lips.
00:21:00,00:21:01,Pork coca lips.
00:21:01,00:21:03,Pork coca lips is better.
00:21:03,00:21:13,"America sort of similarly has a reserve of helium because, in 1921, they thought the blimp"
00:21:13,00:21:18,"was going to be the ultimate war weapon for them, so they built these huge factories"
00:21:18,00:21:22,"for all the helium that they were keeping for their blimps, but they got rid of the blimps,"
00:21:22,00:21:26,"but they kept the helium, so they still have in Amarillo, Texas."
00:21:26,00:21:32,"There's an 11 billion cubic feet reserve of helium that they've kept, and it's just"
00:21:32,00:21:33,there.
00:21:33,00:21:34,It's just waiting.
00:21:34,00:21:37,"But it's embarrassing, I think, for the people who were initially working on it when"
00:21:37,00:21:38,they were asked what they did.
00:21:38,00:21:41,"And they'd say, I worked for the military during helium, and then 10 years later, it was,"
00:21:41,00:21:42,I worked for children's birthday parties.
00:21:42,00:21:43,Yeah.
00:21:43,00:21:44,It's a regular helium.
00:21:44,00:21:49,"The kind of clowns we've seen leaving with a reserve, the biggest ice to the century."
00:21:49,00:21:54,"How many, how much helium do you think you'd have to inhale before you could float away out"
00:21:54,00:21:55,of the helium?
00:21:55,00:21:56,Too much.
00:21:56,00:21:57,Too much.
00:21:57,00:21:58,Too much.
00:21:58,00:21:59,"An unhealthy amount, you know."
00:21:59,00:22:01,"Yeah, I think you need to pump it your body full of it, basically."
00:22:01,00:22:02,Okay.
00:22:02,00:22:03,"Hey, we need to move on."
00:22:03,00:22:04,We need to move on.
00:22:04,00:22:05,"Just one, I think."
00:22:05,00:22:06,Yeah.
00:22:06,00:22:11,"So the EU famously, especially in the '80s, had butter mountains and wine lakes for exactly"
00:22:11,00:22:13,the same reason.
00:22:13,00:22:17,There was a building in Wiltshire that was holding enough butter to spread on 50 million
00:22:17,00:22:23,"slices of toast, and the Monster Raving Looney party suggested that we should turn it into"
00:22:23,00:22:27,"a butter mountain, turn the butter mountain into a ski slope for Eddie the Eagle to practice"
00:22:27,00:22:28,on.
00:22:28,00:22:29,Oh.
00:22:29,00:22:30,"Oh, because of the soft landing."
00:22:30,00:22:31,Because it was a butterfly.
00:22:31,00:22:36,"It was a bit like snow, because it's a mountain, bit like snow, and he needed somewhere"
00:22:36,00:22:37,to practice.
00:22:37,00:22:40,"Yeah, but I just also think that butter would be a really nice substance to fall on."
00:22:40,00:22:45,Just try and impose logic on the Monster Raving Looney party policy platform.
00:22:45,00:22:47,You're right.
00:22:47,00:22:57,"Okay, it is time for fact number three, and that is Andy."
00:22:57,00:23:02,"My fact is that when Russia invaded Finland in 1940, they were so convinced that they will"
00:23:02,00:23:08,be welcomed with a celebration that they took musical instruments with them as they invaded.
00:23:08,00:23:09,And they were not.
00:23:09,00:23:10,No.
00:23:10,00:23:11,No.
00:23:11,00:23:13,So this is a thing called the Winter War.
00:23:13,00:23:18,"It was between the Soviet Union and Finland, and it was part of the Second World War."
00:23:18,00:23:21,"So the Second World War was in full swing, and the Soviet Union had, I think, wanted a bit"
00:23:21,00:23:24,of Finnish territory.
00:23:24,00:23:29,"And Finland said, no, we don't want to lease you this land or all for you to have it."
00:23:29,00:23:30,So Russia invaded.
00:23:30,00:23:34,"And it was this very, very asymmetrical war."
00:23:34,00:23:35,Soviet Union had a lot of resources.
00:23:35,00:23:37,Finland had almost none.
00:23:37,00:23:43,"And all right, the Soviet Union did win the war, sure, but they managed to really drag out"
00:23:43,00:23:44,the campaign.
00:23:44,00:23:47,And they lost way more people.
00:23:47,00:23:49,"I think they lost five times as many troops in the Winter War, didn't they?"
00:23:49,00:23:50,The Soviet Union.
00:23:50,00:23:51,"Yeah, the Soviet Union."
00:23:51,00:23:52,And it was a disaster for them.
00:23:52,00:23:56,"It was one of those was that they, maybe they officially won it, because in the end, Finland"
00:23:56,00:24:00,"had to seed this bit of land that they wanted, but it was a disaster because they hadn't"
00:24:00,00:24:02,expected it to be so rough.
00:24:02,00:24:05,"Which is weird, because the main thing they weren't expecting, according to all accounts,"
00:24:05,00:24:08,was the terrible weather and the freezing cold.
00:24:08,00:24:11,"But you would have thought, I mean, that's what everyone else, the problem everyone else"
00:24:11,00:24:12,stumbled into when invading Russia.
00:24:12,00:24:16,So you would have thought the Russians would know and be prepared.
00:24:16,00:24:18,Would they probably thought like a winter Olympian?
00:24:18,00:24:19,Good.
00:24:19,00:24:20,I know cold.
00:24:20,00:24:22,How cold is that going to be?
00:24:22,00:24:24,They probably thought they had it covered.
00:24:24,00:24:25,And it was another level.
00:24:25,00:24:26,Yeah.
00:24:26,00:24:29,I was reading into the Winter War and knew nothing about it.
00:24:29,00:24:33,"And you know, when you do this kind of research, your eyes get sort of caught by things"
00:24:33,00:24:37,"like sausage war and you think, oh, that's going to be funny."
00:24:37,00:24:39,And it's not because it's war.
00:24:39,00:24:45,And basically what it was is the Soviets had managed to get into Finnish enemy lines and
00:24:45,00:24:47,snuck up on them from behind.
00:24:47,00:24:51,And so they caught them completely off guard and they were taking out a lot of their troops
00:24:51,00:24:52,as they were heading towards their camp.
00:24:52,00:24:57,"But from the direction they came, they arrived at the bit of camp where the chefs had just"
00:24:57,00:25:00,been making a massive meal for all of the troops.
00:25:00,00:25:03,So it was a ginormous tent full of just freshly made sausages.
00:25:03,00:25:09,And these poor soldiers who'd been starved and were freezing were so taken by the smell
00:25:09,00:25:14,and the fact that they'd not eaten that they just went in and they ate all of the sausages.
00:25:14,00:25:17,"And while that was happening, the Finnish troops were able to regroup and get back in time"
00:25:17,00:25:18,to defend it.
00:25:18,00:25:21,"So no one officially, I think, won it necessarily."
00:25:21,00:25:22,It's just a little episode in the...
00:25:22,00:25:25,"I think the Soviets got completely routed, didn't they?"
00:25:25,00:25:26,Yeah.
00:25:26,00:25:27,That is quite funny.
00:25:27,00:25:31,But they kind of lost because they were too busy mongering sausages.
00:25:31,00:25:32,"Yeah, I know the war, though."
00:25:32,00:25:33,It's a skirmish.
00:25:33,00:25:34,It's a sausage skirmish.
00:25:34,00:25:35,A sausage skirmish.
00:25:35,00:25:36,Yeah.
00:25:36,00:25:39,Do you know that the Finnish had saunas on the front line?
00:25:39,00:25:40,No.
00:25:40,00:25:41,Get out.
00:25:41,00:25:46,They took every Finnish soldier for every two or three days was allowed to go to one of
00:25:46,00:25:47,the saunas.
00:25:47,00:25:50,They wanted to carry the saunas with them as they were in front.
00:25:50,00:25:54,"So they had a few mobile saunas, which I guess, probably on wheels."
00:25:54,00:25:57,I'm guessing about that or skis.
00:25:57,00:26:01,And they also utilized the saunas in villages around Finland.
00:26:01,00:26:02,Cool.
00:26:02,00:26:06,"And it was really good, not just because it was saunas and Finnish people of saunas, but"
00:26:06,00:26:09,also because it prevented frostbites and it helped kill bacteria.
00:26:09,00:26:14,So they didn't have nearly as many problems medically as the Russians did for that reason.
00:26:14,00:26:15,"Oh, clever."
00:26:15,00:26:16,That's very good.
00:26:16,00:26:17,"It was a guerrilla war, basically."
00:26:17,00:26:18,Yes.
00:26:18,00:26:21,"And they took advantage of the fact, like in loads of guerrilla wars, the infrastructure"
00:26:21,00:26:22,wasn't really there.
00:26:22,00:26:24,So there were very few roads into Finland.
00:26:24,00:26:28,"And either side of the roads that you had, we incredibly thick forest."
00:26:28,00:26:32,"So you would have a column of tanks and you might mind the road, so then the tanks have"
00:26:32,00:26:36,to stop because one of the front ones has been damaged.
00:26:36,00:26:39,"And then from that point on, the Finns just kind of appeared through the woodlands and"
00:26:39,00:26:43,"constantly, you know, harassed the Soviet troops."
00:26:43,00:26:44,"On skis, mostly."
00:26:44,00:26:45,On skis.
00:26:45,00:26:49,And they were much better skis because they had trained to ski because they didn't have
00:26:49,00:26:50,this infrastructure at all.
00:26:50,00:26:51,So that's the only way you could get through.
00:26:51,00:26:55,"I think the Soviets were just taught to wear skis, stand up, fire a gun, whereas the Finns"
00:26:55,00:26:57,could actually dart about.
00:26:57,00:27:00,"And the Soviet skis were just kind of ones that they kind of cobbled together, whereas the"
00:27:00,00:27:03,Finnish people were all using their own skis.
00:27:03,00:27:07,"And so the Soviet skis were so bad that when the Finnish kind of captured them, they just"
00:27:07,00:27:09,were no use and they just used them for firewood.
00:27:09,00:27:10,"Oh, really?"
00:27:10,00:27:11,Sorry.
00:27:11,00:27:12,Wow.
00:27:12,00:27:16,"And at the Winter Olympics, people have been throwing away their skis, haven't they?"
00:27:16,00:27:17,Have they?
00:27:17,00:27:18,Yeah.
00:27:18,00:27:19,"Oh, yeah, because it's too cold."
00:27:19,00:27:25,"Apparently, the first time you try skis on practice runs, one of the coaches said that they"
00:27:25,00:27:28,just turned to garbage the skis because they get damaged by it being too cold.
00:27:28,00:27:29,It warps.
00:27:29,00:27:32,"So there's snow at his, I think, and then it's too cold and it warps the ski."
00:27:32,00:27:33,Wow.
00:27:33,00:27:34,Yeah.
00:27:34,00:27:39,I was just looking at wars where people have had way too high expectations that have turned
00:27:39,00:27:40,out to be wrong.
00:27:40,00:27:45,"So these guys in Finland, you know, they had this band because they really thought that"
00:27:45,00:27:46,they'd got the victory.
00:27:46,00:27:47,Yeah.
00:27:47,00:27:52,"So, literally, in the ball war, I was reading about when British soldiers in the second ball"
00:27:52,00:27:57,"war were, they mounted this to this really good strategic point called Sion Kopp and it"
00:27:57,00:28:01,was this hill and they got up quite easily and they realized there were very few casualties
00:28:01,00:28:03,and they were fighting the balls on all sides.
00:28:03,00:28:06,They made it to the top of this hill and it was brilliant and they thought we've like
00:28:06,00:28:08,achieved this massive victory.
00:28:08,00:28:09,We're going to be fine.
00:28:09,00:28:12,The leader of those troops and a message back to the general saying he could expect his
00:28:12,00:28:17,position to be held until Doomsday against all comers because they were at the peak of this
00:28:17,00:28:21,"really important hill and they dug trenches in, planned to stay there."
00:28:21,00:28:26,So that was in the evening and there was a big fog hanging over them and the next morning
00:28:26,00:28:30,the fog lifted and it was one of those things where you think it's the peak of a mountain
00:28:30,00:28:34,but then the fog lifts and there's actually loads more peaks around and the fog lifted
00:28:34,00:28:39,and there were three more peaks on all sides and all the balls just sitting on them waiting
00:28:39,00:28:42,"to get down at them going, you bunch of idiots."
00:28:42,00:28:49,"And that is where the name of the cop Liverpool's football ground, one of the stands is called"
00:28:49,00:28:50,the cop.
00:28:50,00:28:53,Because it was originally there.
00:28:53,00:28:55,That's amazing.
00:28:55,00:29:01,"A lot of stadiums were built around this time, was it late 19th century, wasn't it?"
00:29:01,00:29:05,"It was kind of, this was a slanted bit of land and all these places where people were watching"
00:29:05,00:29:09,football from was slanted bits of land so there were a few of them were named cops and
00:29:09,00:29:11,Liverpool's the one that's kind of stuck around.
00:29:11,00:29:13,That's very interesting.
00:29:13,00:29:14,"Very interesting, yeah."
00:29:14,00:29:20,Do you guys know about Simon Hayha who I'm almost certain that's not how you pronounce his
00:29:20,00:29:21,name.
00:29:21,00:29:24,"In fact, I'm going to come out and say it, that's not how you pronounce his name."
00:29:24,00:29:25,He was finished.
00:29:25,00:29:30,He has the most number of confirmed kills of any soldier in history.
00:29:30,00:29:31,Wow.
00:29:31,00:29:38,505 with his rifle alone and possibly 200 plus more and the Soviets were so worried about
00:29:38,00:29:41,him because he was like a sniper just taking people out.
00:29:41,00:29:47,They would send artillery strikes in order just to kill him because he killed probably
00:29:47,00:29:51,0.6% of all the Soviet fatalities in the Winter War were down to him.
00:29:51,00:29:52,Geez.
00:29:52,00:29:53,Oh my goodness.
00:29:53,00:29:59,And he had a full white camouflage suit so no one could ever see him and so they couldn't
00:29:59,00:30:00,see his breath.
00:30:00,00:30:05,He used to put snow in his mouth so that his breath would be cold so that they wouldn't
00:30:05,00:30:06,be able to see him that way.
00:30:06,00:30:07,That's amazing.
00:30:07,00:30:10,Why wasn't all Winter Army uniforms just white?
00:30:10,00:30:11,They were.
00:30:11,00:30:15,All the fins were all this fins and skis were in the white uniform.
00:30:15,00:30:16,They didn't eat snow.
00:30:16,00:30:18,"No, but the Russians didn't."
00:30:18,00:30:19,They came in carcay.
00:30:19,00:30:21,So that was one another one of the problems.
00:30:21,00:30:22,"Yeah, they were."
00:30:22,00:30:23,They got the wrong.
00:30:23,00:30:24,That's a bit of an oversight.
00:30:24,00:30:28,Big arrows above the same enemy here.
00:30:28,00:30:35,The lot of immigrants from America and Canada finishing immigrants to American Canada returned
00:30:35,00:30:36,home for the war.
00:30:36,00:30:41,They sort of came back to sort of help Finland out and they had a lot of volunteers as well
00:30:41,00:30:42,who did that.
00:30:42,00:30:46,One of which was the actor Christopher Lee who fought in the Winter War.
00:30:46,00:30:47,What?
00:30:47,00:30:52,"Yeah, Sarah Man from the Hobbit movies Count Duku from the second Star Wars movie maker"
00:30:52,00:30:53,from the man with a golden gun.
00:30:53,00:30:54,We know the filmography.
00:30:54,00:30:56,We didn't know he fought in the Winter War.
00:30:56,00:30:57,Yeah.
00:30:57,00:30:58,Doesn't say that on his IMDB.
00:30:58,00:30:59,Does it?
00:30:59,00:31:00,"No, it's it's."
00:31:00,00:31:01,Yeah.
00:31:01,00:31:05,He was not on the front line but he was he went back for the effort and he was a volunteer
00:31:05,00:31:06,and he helps.
00:31:06,00:31:08,"No, he was he was just going to start it."
00:31:08,00:31:09,He was.
00:31:09,00:31:10,Oh my gosh.
00:31:10,00:31:11,Oh my god.
00:31:11,00:31:13,You're better than that.
00:31:13,00:31:18,"I'm not sure he is, James."
00:31:18,00:31:19,"No, he was America."
00:31:19,00:31:20,He was just volunteering.
00:31:20,00:31:25,"Dan, do you know there's a conspiracy theory that Finland doesn't exist?"
00:31:25,00:31:26,No.
00:31:26,00:31:27,Oh my god.
00:31:27,00:31:28,What's the reason?
00:31:28,00:31:29,What's the reason?
00:31:29,00:31:30,The other one is the mix.
00:31:30,00:31:31,What's the reason?
00:31:31,00:31:37,The idea is that it was made up by the Soviet Union and Japan.
00:31:37,00:31:40,And the reason was that the fishing is so good around the Baltic Sea area.
00:31:40,00:31:43,They wanted other countries to think there's no point sending boats there because there's
00:31:43,00:31:44,a massive country in the way.
00:31:44,00:31:45,Oh wow.
00:31:45,00:31:50,And so the idea is that there is no such place as Finland and all the people who think
00:31:50,00:31:56,that they're Finnish are actually living in Estonia and other countries around there.
00:31:56,00:32:00,"And according to the conspiracy theorists, the fact that it's called Finland is a clue"
00:32:00,00:32:03,because fish have fiddens.
00:32:03,00:32:04,That's very good.
00:32:04,00:32:05,See?
00:32:05,00:32:06,Yeah.
00:32:06,00:32:08,Built on solid reasoning.
00:32:08,00:32:17,So who's buying all the saunas if it's not the thing?
00:32:17,00:32:22,"Okay, it is time for our final fact of the show and that is my fact."
00:32:22,00:32:28,"My fact this week is that Greek gods of the ocean include Poseidon, Triton, Oceanus"
00:32:28,00:32:36,"and Doris, Doris the God who just brought them all tea and biscuits in the afternoon."
00:32:36,00:32:37,Yeah.
00:32:37,00:32:38,So they're all oceanids.
00:32:38,00:32:40,Doris is an oceanid.
00:32:40,00:32:42,"She, Doris is Poseidon's mother-in-law."
00:32:42,00:32:47,"Do you want to, when you say an oceanid, as if that's just a word that we casually use"
00:32:47,00:32:48,in day to day life?
00:32:48,00:32:49,Yeah.
00:32:49,00:32:50,I should explain what it is.
00:32:50,00:32:53,"An oceanid is like a cryptid, cryptid being yetis and stuff."
00:32:53,00:32:57,An oceanid is a specific god of the ocean.
00:32:57,00:32:58,Is that right?
00:32:58,00:33:01,"Oceanid, maybe, I don't know."
00:33:01,00:33:02,"Oh yeah, maybe."
00:33:02,00:33:03,Oceanid.
00:33:03,00:33:07,"All the ancient Greeks are dead, so no one is going to write this in great terms."
00:33:07,00:33:09,"But yeah, I just love that as a..."
00:33:09,00:33:10,Poseidon's mother-in-law.
00:33:10,00:33:11,Yeah.
00:33:11,00:33:15,So she's associated with a lot of very famous names that you would know if you know basic
00:33:15,00:33:16,Greek godology.
00:33:16,00:33:20,That I am certain is not a word.
00:33:20,00:33:24,I think we should just apologise now for all our pronunciations for everything for
00:33:24,00:33:29,"the last four years, but especially for the next four years, yeah."
00:33:29,00:33:35,"Doric is a Greek word, obviously mostly famous for Doric architecture, so everyone knows"
00:33:35,00:33:36,that I spot a Doric column.
00:33:36,00:33:37,I feel like...
00:33:37,00:33:38,I feel like...
00:33:38,00:33:39,Oh yeah.
00:33:39,00:33:42,"So there was an area called Doris, which is where the Doric architecture was from, which"
00:33:42,00:33:43,I...
00:33:43,00:33:44,Yeah.
00:33:44,00:33:47,Can you tell us how to recognise a Doric column?
00:33:47,00:33:48,I don't know how to do that.
00:33:48,00:33:49,I always...
00:33:49,00:33:50,I'm going to get it wrong.
00:33:50,00:33:55,"I always thought it was the ones, so they're wider at the bottom than at the top, which"
00:33:55,00:33:58,"often you don't notice that, because it's further away at the top anyway."
00:33:58,00:33:59,Got it.
00:33:59,00:34:02,"And they've got those little grooves in them, so you know columns that have grooves."
00:34:02,00:34:03,Yeah.
00:34:03,00:34:04,So they're quite plain.
00:34:04,00:34:06,"What's really funny is that you and I are discussing this, and I'm the actually known."
00:34:06,00:34:08,And I'm absolutely trying to get it.
00:34:08,00:34:10,I'm actually trying to get it.
00:34:10,00:34:11,"No, I don't know."
00:34:11,00:34:12,We've got time.
00:34:12,00:34:13,"Right, guys."
00:34:13,00:34:14,Okay.
00:34:14,00:34:15,Basically Doric is the absolute vanilla of columns.
00:34:15,00:34:16,It's also got the grooves.
00:34:16,00:34:18,It's got a couple of round bands at the top.
00:34:18,00:34:19,Nothing fancy.
00:34:19,00:34:23,"Doric's ionic, which has got the curly scrolls, and then Corinthian are the crazy, crazy"
00:34:23,00:34:27,"ones, which have got flowers and bursting pineapples at the top."
00:34:27,00:34:28,Those are the really fancy ones.
00:34:28,00:34:29,Right?
00:34:29,00:34:31,"Then you get some composite ones as well, but we don't have time for that."
00:34:31,00:34:32,"No, please."
00:34:32,00:34:34,"No, no, no."
00:34:34,00:34:35,No.
00:34:35,00:34:40,Doric felt like she was the god of the kind of rubbishy part of the ocean.
00:34:40,00:34:45,So she was specifically the god of the mouth of rivers where the freshwater mingles with
00:34:45,00:34:48,"the brine, and it gets really briny and salty."
00:34:48,00:34:52,"So she was really just that specific part that she managed, and she represented the fertility"
00:34:52,00:34:53,of the sea.
00:34:53,00:34:54,"That's quite a good bit, I think."
00:34:54,00:34:55,Yeah.
00:34:55,00:34:56,It was a fishing ground.
00:34:56,00:34:59,"So if you were into fishing, it was like mungrobes and stuff like that, right?"
00:34:59,00:35:00,Yeah.
00:35:00,00:35:04,It does feel a bit like she was at the back of the queue when the bits of the ocean were
00:35:04,00:35:06,being handed out to all the gods.
00:35:06,00:35:09,"There was a god called Akkalaus, who was the patron god of the Akkalaus River, and that"
00:35:09,00:35:11,"was the largest river in ancient Greece, so that was quite important."
00:35:11,00:35:15,But I like the thing about him was that he created the river by crying.
00:35:15,00:35:26,"He was the Justin Timberlake of his time, wasn't he?"
00:35:26,00:35:29,There were still loads of things to date that are named after the gods.
00:35:29,00:35:34,"So there was one article, you know quartz.com, who's a really good, there was an article all"
00:35:34,00:35:38,about hedge funds which are named after the gods.
00:35:38,00:35:42,"And it did mention an analysis, which found that if you add a word which conveys gravitas"
00:35:42,00:35:48,"to the name of your big financial body, likes use or aries or Poseidon or the Roman equivalents."
00:35:48,00:35:49,"Oh, Doris."
00:35:49,00:35:53,"Oh, I'm not sure about Doris, that is a thing."
00:35:53,00:35:58,"If you add a gravitas word, it adds $250,000 of income each year."
00:35:58,00:35:59,Wow.
00:35:59,00:36:05,But it also pointed out that almost all of these names are really badly chosen.
00:36:05,00:36:06,So Hermes is chosen for loads of them.
00:36:06,00:36:09,He was the god of swindlers.
00:36:09,00:36:13,"There's Medea who murdered her ex-boyfriend's sons, there's Icarus who famously flies"
00:36:13,00:36:17,too high and then crashes into the ocean.
00:36:17,00:36:20,And then there's Tantlers who is good because he's wealthy.
00:36:20,00:36:24,"But he also, when the gods visited him, he killed his own son and roasted him to impress"
00:36:24,00:36:25,the gods.
00:36:25,00:36:28,So they punished him to eternal hunger and thirst.
00:36:28,00:36:30,"But they all have the odd skeleton in their closet, don't they?"
00:36:30,00:36:31,These gods.
00:36:31,00:36:32,That's true.
00:36:32,00:36:33,"You know, they often do good stuff."
00:36:33,00:36:36,"But then they, you know, eat their children or whatever."
00:36:36,00:36:38,But there's always something for all of you.
00:36:38,00:36:44,These are the weird things I do to impress someone who's roasted and eat your own son.
00:36:44,00:36:50,"Just on names, I found that the eldest cyclops of Gaia was called Bronte."
00:36:50,00:36:54,"And Bronte was for the thunder, god of the thunder."
00:36:54,00:37:00,"So you've got the Brontosaurus or thunder lizard, which gets its name from the Bronte."
00:37:00,00:37:01,There's a theory.
00:37:01,00:37:04,Now I'm getting this from Stephen Fry's mythos book.
00:37:04,00:37:07,"And so this is a footnote, which is a theory he's putting forward that someone has come"
00:37:07,00:37:15,"up with, the Bronte sisters are actually named after this Greek god, Bronte."
00:37:15,00:37:21,"And it's because their father was born Bronte, B-R-U-N-T-Y, but changed it to Bronte, either"
00:37:21,00:37:26,"as a tribute to the classical Greek god or in honor of Admiral Nelson, who was made"
00:37:26,00:37:28,the Duke of Bronte.
00:37:28,00:37:31,And that dukedom was located on the slopes of Etna.
00:37:31,00:37:34,And that was believed to have been derived from the cyclops named Bronte.
00:37:34,00:37:38,So the Bronte sisters are possibly a tribute name to a Greek god.
00:37:38,00:37:40,That's very cool.
00:37:40,00:37:41,"That's pretty cool, eh?"
00:37:41,00:37:46,Some more gods from that big list on Wikipedia of gods.
00:37:46,00:37:49,Chiamites is the demigod of the bean.
00:37:49,00:37:54,"Wow, not even the god of the bean, out."
00:37:54,00:38:01,Accratopotes is the god of unmixed wine and incontinence.
00:38:01,00:38:06,"And Harpocrates, I quite like him, he is the god of silence."
00:38:06,00:38:12,And a lot of people thought that Harpo Marx got his name because he was always silent.
00:38:12,00:38:14,But actually he got his name because he played the harp.
00:38:14,00:38:15,He played the harp.
00:38:15,00:38:17,It's just a coincidence.
00:38:17,00:38:25,There was a god called Anna Idea and the Anna Idea was a spirit of ruthlessness.
00:38:25,00:38:26,"Yeah, yeah."
00:38:26,00:38:27,I can do that.
00:38:27,00:38:29,Shamelessness and unforgivingness.
00:38:29,00:38:32,"Oh, that does sound a bit harsh."
00:38:32,00:38:37,"Have you, you know, Kardea, who's the Roman goddess of door hinges?"
00:38:37,00:38:38,Cool.
00:38:38,00:38:39,"Quite a, quite a low-rung."
00:38:39,00:38:40,"Well, no, it's interesting."
00:38:40,00:38:43,I wouldn't have known they had hinges back then.
00:38:43,00:38:45,I didn't think the doors opened because they had doors.
00:38:45,00:38:46,Okay.
00:38:46,00:38:48,Well done Greeks.
00:38:48,00:38:50,There was Roman.
00:38:50,00:38:51,I was Roman.
00:38:51,00:38:52,"Sorry, Roman."
00:38:52,00:38:53,"He was Roman, yeah."
00:38:53,00:38:54,I think also the Greeks might have had hinges on doors.
00:38:54,00:38:55,We don't know that.
00:38:55,00:39:01,It's so annoying because I can't prove to you that we do know that in the moment.
00:39:01,00:39:02,I think we do know that.
00:39:02,00:39:04,That must be annoying.
00:39:04,00:39:06,There are still people who worship the ancient Greek gods.
00:39:06,00:39:07,Not many.
00:39:07,00:39:08,No.
00:39:08,00:39:09,I'll say that.
00:39:09,00:39:14,"But in Greece, in 2006, a court in Athens officially unbanned their worship, but only about"
00:39:14,00:39:15,2000 worshipers.
00:39:15,00:39:20,"And the story in the Guardian quoted a Christian priest in Greece who said, ""They are a handful"
00:39:20,00:39:25,of miserable resuscitators of a degenerate dead religion who wish to return to the monstrous
00:39:25,00:39:27,"dark delusions of the past."""
00:39:27,00:39:30,"That's harsh for what is just a bunch of harmless excents, isn't it?"
00:39:30,00:39:31,I think so.
00:39:31,00:39:32,Yeah.
00:39:32,00:39:33,Do you know the word atheists?
00:39:33,00:39:37,Where we get atheism comes from without God or God forsaken or abandoned by God?
00:39:37,00:39:40,That's what it originally meant.
00:39:40,00:39:42,And we got the word from the French.
00:39:42,00:39:45,"And in English, it predates the word ""theism"" by over 100 years."
00:39:45,00:39:49,"So atheism was the first thing, and then we got theism afterwards."
00:39:49,00:39:50,"Oh, no."
00:39:50,00:39:51,That was interesting.
00:39:51,00:39:52,That is interesting.
00:39:52,00:39:55,It's absolutely opposite of what I thought would have been.
00:39:55,00:39:59,"I think that's why, you know, I think that's why I mentioned it."
00:39:59,00:40:02,"If all my facts were exactly what you felt they were going to be, then this would be a"
00:40:02,00:40:03,very barry podcast.
00:40:03,00:40:09,"Well, maybe you've finally said something I didn't know you said."
00:40:09,00:40:14,"Okay, that is it."
00:40:14,00:40:15,That is all of our facts.
