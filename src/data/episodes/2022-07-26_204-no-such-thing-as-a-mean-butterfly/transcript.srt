00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:17,000
 *sad piano music*

00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,280
 Hello, and welcome to another episode of no such thing as a fish, a weekly podcast

3
00:00:20,280 --> 00:00:23,580
 coming to you from the QI offices in Covert Garden.

4
00:00:23,580 --> 00:00:28,560
 My name is Dan Schreiber, I am sitting here with James Harkin, Anna Chazinski, and Andrew

5
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:33,000
 Hunch and Murray, and once again we have gathered around the microphones with our four favorite

6
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:37,800
 facts from the last seven days, and in no particular order, here we go.

7
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:39,600
 Starting with you, James.

8
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:45,240
 Okay, my fact this week is that due to climate change, nine out of the 21 cities that have

9
00:00:45,240 --> 00:00:50,360
 hosted the Winter Olympics will be too warm to do so by 2050.

10
00:00:50,360 --> 00:00:54,300
 I was glad to see that you put climate change in air quotes there, James, just for the

11
00:00:54,300 --> 00:00:59,420
 second. It's so cold, climate change. Yeah, sure they will.

12
00:00:59,420 --> 00:01:04,460
 I did not do that to people at home, I wouldn't do that, but this is about the Winter Olympics

13
00:01:04,460 --> 00:01:08,340
 and I'm really excited because the opening ceremony is happening now as we're doing this

14
00:01:08,340 --> 00:01:09,340
 podcast.

15
00:01:09,340 --> 00:01:10,340
 Is it really?

16
00:01:10,340 --> 00:01:11,340
 Just right now.

17
00:01:11,340 --> 00:01:14,860
 And by the time this goes out it will be one week into the Olympics, and Britain will

18
00:01:14,860 --> 00:01:16,740
 be top of the medals chart, probably.

19
00:01:16,740 --> 00:01:17,740
 Wow.

20
00:01:17,740 --> 00:01:21,020
 I've heard things about Australia having a good year, so.

21
00:01:21,020 --> 00:01:22,020
 Are they?

22
00:01:22,020 --> 00:01:23,620
 Have you got a lot of snow in Australia?

23
00:01:23,620 --> 00:01:29,780
 No, but apparently nowhere does any more, so it's actually playing to our favour.

24
00:01:29,780 --> 00:01:32,060
 Just on who's going to be where are the medals charts, there's a guy from Tonga.

25
00:01:32,060 --> 00:01:33,060
 Is there?

26
00:01:33,060 --> 00:01:34,060
 A head of him?

27
00:01:34,060 --> 00:01:35,060
 No.

28
00:01:35,060 --> 00:01:36,060
 He's really good.

29
00:01:36,060 --> 00:01:39,060
 His name, and I hope I pronounce it right, is Peter Talfa Tafua, and he tried to learn

30
00:01:39,060 --> 00:01:40,900
 cross-country skiing in a year.

31
00:01:40,900 --> 00:01:44,420
 He's the only Tonga athlete ever to have been in the summer and the Winter Olympics.

32
00:01:44,420 --> 00:01:45,420
 Wow.

33
00:01:45,420 --> 00:01:48,860
 He did all his training on roller skis and paved roads.

34
00:01:48,860 --> 00:01:52,340
 He's basically a one-man cool runnings.

35
00:01:52,340 --> 00:01:53,340
 He hates it as well.

36
00:01:53,340 --> 00:01:54,340
 He's the other thing.

37
00:01:54,340 --> 00:01:57,700
 He said, "Every time I ski, I feel like I die a little inside.

38
00:01:57,700 --> 00:02:01,300
 I still haven't had a race where I felt completely happy."

39
00:02:01,300 --> 00:02:02,300
 Oh, no.

40
00:02:02,300 --> 00:02:07,100
 So, even though this, you know, the climate is going to warm, and it's going to be all ruined

41
00:02:07,100 --> 00:02:11,460
 by 2050, at the moment, everyone's really whining about how cold it is, aren't they?

42
00:02:11,460 --> 00:02:16,180
 In Pyongchang, apparently, it's really absolutely freezing, but to an extent, the people don't

43
00:02:16,180 --> 00:02:20,300
 really like, so I think it's meant to be about -10, but the windshield factor there, because

44
00:02:20,300 --> 00:02:24,020
 it's so windy, brings it down to -25.

45
00:02:24,020 --> 00:02:28,260
 And they're all tweeting that they can't do anything, and the Australian Olympic athlete

46
00:02:28,260 --> 00:02:32,460
 called Lydia Lassiller was asked to be flag bearer in the ceremony, and she said, "It's

47
00:02:32,460 --> 00:02:33,460
 too cold.

48
00:02:33,460 --> 00:02:34,460
 It's bad for my knees.

49
00:02:34,460 --> 00:02:36,460
 I'm not going to be flag bearer for my country, sorry."

50
00:02:36,460 --> 00:02:37,460
 Wow.

51
00:02:37,460 --> 00:02:38,460
 Is she going at all?

52
00:02:38,460 --> 00:02:39,460
 Yeah, yeah, she's going, but she's the same.

53
00:02:39,460 --> 00:02:42,020
 Of course you think, if you go to the Winter Olympics, you should know what you're letting

54
00:02:42,020 --> 00:02:44,060
 yourself in for, which is that it's going to be cold.

55
00:02:44,060 --> 00:02:45,060
 Just wear an extra jumper.

56
00:02:45,060 --> 00:02:46,060
 You wear an extra jumper, yeah.

57
00:02:46,060 --> 00:02:47,060
 Maybe bring some gloves.

58
00:02:47,060 --> 00:02:48,060
 I have no sympathy.

59
00:02:48,060 --> 00:02:55,540
 Pyeongchang is 700 meters above sea level, and they call that the Happy 700, and they say that

60
00:02:55,540 --> 00:02:58,820
 it's the optimal altitude for humans and animals to live.

61
00:02:58,820 --> 00:02:59,820
 Really?

62
00:02:59,820 --> 00:03:00,820
 Apparently.

63
00:03:00,820 --> 00:03:01,820
 It is.

64
00:03:01,820 --> 00:03:04,500
 It is the coldest place on Earth for its altitude.

65
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:05,500
 Is that right?

66
00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:06,500
 Yeah.

67
00:03:06,500 --> 00:03:07,500
 Wow.

68
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:10,500
 And I think it's kind of too cold for it, it doesn't snow very much, so it's very dry,

69
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:12,140
 and it's mostly using fake snow, I think.

70
00:03:12,140 --> 00:03:14,860
 Well, this guy from Tonga is going to be right at home, isn't he?

71
00:03:14,860 --> 00:03:17,340
 He's going to be the other guy who could do it.

72
00:03:17,340 --> 00:03:19,620
 Yeah, they stockpile fake snow.

73
00:03:19,620 --> 00:03:20,620
 Yeah.

74
00:03:20,620 --> 00:03:23,740
 So, in Sachi, when Sachi had the Winter Olympics, it was quite warm there.

75
00:03:23,740 --> 00:03:27,660
 They had the opposite problem to what they have now, and they stockpiled 60 million cubic

76
00:03:27,660 --> 00:03:32,420
 feet of snow just so that they could layer it properly and beat the ski on it.

77
00:03:32,420 --> 00:03:35,180
 Sachi is definitely one of these that will be too warm by 2015.

78
00:03:35,180 --> 00:03:36,180
 That is probably too warm now.

79
00:03:36,180 --> 00:03:37,180
 Wow.

80
00:03:37,180 --> 00:03:38,180
 It was probably too warm when it happened.

81
00:03:38,180 --> 00:03:39,180
 I think you're right.

82
00:03:39,180 --> 00:03:43,580
 Well, have you seen all the reports of the 2022 Olympics, the Winter Olympics?

83
00:03:43,580 --> 00:03:48,580
 This is in Beijing, so Beijing won it, and the photos that they showed of dead in the middle

84
00:03:48,580 --> 00:03:52,500
 of their winter was of the mountain range where it's going to be taking place, and it's

85
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:53,500
 just green.

86
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:54,500
 A whole thing.

87
00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:55,940
 There's just no snow at all.

88
00:03:55,940 --> 00:04:02,820
 And so they're going to be using a lot of fake snow as well, and they won it off Almaty,

89
00:04:02,820 --> 00:04:08,580
 which is Kazakhstan, or yeah, Almaty and Kazakhstan, and they're slogan to rub it in was keeping

90
00:04:08,580 --> 00:04:12,660
 it real, because they were like, we've actually got snow for this winter Olympics, and they

91
00:04:12,660 --> 00:04:13,660
 still lost.

92
00:04:13,660 --> 00:04:21,260
 Do you know, in 1960, for the 1960 Winter Olympics, one of the cities that BED was Karachi in Pakistan?

93
00:04:21,260 --> 00:04:22,260
 Wow.

94
00:04:22,260 --> 00:04:24,860
 But do you have Himalayas there, I guess?

95
00:04:24,860 --> 00:04:26,420
 Not in Karachi, actually.

96
00:04:26,420 --> 00:04:30,340
 They do have it in the north of the country, but they don't have it there.

97
00:04:30,340 --> 00:04:33,380
 They have no traditions of any winter sports.

98
00:04:33,380 --> 00:04:37,980
 It's a tropical city on the Arabian Sea, and the coldest temperature, it has ever had

99
00:04:37,980 --> 00:04:43,500
 that it's entire history, is zero degrees, never, ever gone below zero.

100
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:44,500
 Wow.

101
00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:45,500
 They didn't win.

102
00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:49,020
 That's the thing about China, though, is that there's no tradition of skiing there, and

103
00:04:49,020 --> 00:04:53,020
 as a result, China has, with classic Chinese efficiency, just said, right, everyone is going

104
00:04:53,020 --> 00:04:54,580
 to learn to ski now.

105
00:04:54,580 --> 00:04:59,860
 So they've created 800 ski results, and they want, in the next four years, to get 300

106
00:04:59,860 --> 00:05:01,180
 million people skiing.

107
00:05:01,180 --> 00:05:07,380
 Do your China has more statues of footballers, soccer players than any other country apart from

108
00:05:07,380 --> 00:05:08,380
 Britain?

109
00:05:08,380 --> 00:05:09,380
 Does it really?

110
00:05:09,380 --> 00:05:10,380
 Yeah, just of Chinese footballers, or?

111
00:05:10,380 --> 00:05:12,380
 I think they're mostly not Chinese footballers.

112
00:05:12,380 --> 00:05:14,780
 Yeah, there'll be many British ones going to it.

113
00:05:14,780 --> 00:05:16,820
 Or Europeans, yeah, or Brazilians.

114
00:05:16,820 --> 00:05:18,860
 Why do they do that?

115
00:05:18,860 --> 00:05:22,620
 Because they like statues, and they like football.

116
00:05:22,620 --> 00:05:23,620
 Fair enough.

117
00:05:23,620 --> 00:05:27,780
 So they've taken story things, story checks out.

118
00:05:27,780 --> 00:05:32,060
 Did you hear about the Norwegian team at the Winter Olympics this year?

119
00:05:32,060 --> 00:05:33,060
 No.

120
00:05:33,060 --> 00:05:34,060
 No.

121
00:05:34,060 --> 00:05:35,060
 Every team, apparently, I didn't know this.

122
00:05:35,060 --> 00:05:37,300
 They take their own chefs to cook for you.

123
00:05:37,300 --> 00:05:42,020
 And the Norwegian team chefs ordered for the team's feeding for the next fortnight.

124
00:05:42,020 --> 00:05:44,540
 1500 eggs from a Korean delivery service.

125
00:05:44,540 --> 00:05:50,340
 Unfortunately, they made a slight mistake in translation, and they got 15,000 eggs delivered

126
00:05:50,340 --> 00:05:51,340
 to them.

127
00:05:51,340 --> 00:05:52,340
 Wow.

128
00:05:52,340 --> 00:05:53,340
 Yeah.

129
00:05:53,340 --> 00:05:54,340
 I've done that on a cardo before.

130
00:05:54,340 --> 00:05:58,660
 They said, yeah, the truck arrived, and they just kept bringing eggs in.

131
00:05:58,660 --> 00:06:00,620
 And basically, they got half a lorry full of eggs.

132
00:06:00,620 --> 00:06:02,620
 What are they going to do with them?

133
00:06:02,620 --> 00:06:06,540
 Well, what's funny is, I did find this story, actually, and there's a quote where everyone's

134
00:06:06,540 --> 00:06:09,700
 trying to make a massive story out of it, but all the quotes that they come back with,

135
00:06:09,700 --> 00:06:11,260
 they're just like, look, they'll probably use them, I guess.

136
00:06:11,260 --> 00:06:12,260
 I don't know.

137
00:06:12,260 --> 00:06:13,700
 Maybe the people that supplied them will take them back.

138
00:06:13,700 --> 00:06:14,700
 I don't know.

139
00:06:14,700 --> 00:06:15,700
 It's not a big issue.

140
00:06:15,700 --> 00:06:16,700
 No one cares.

141
00:06:16,700 --> 00:06:19,500
 It's not going to give us something.

142
00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:23,100
 I bet the people who had to heave the eggs all the way inside, and then were told

143
00:06:23,100 --> 00:06:24,100
 to remove them again.

144
00:06:24,100 --> 00:06:25,100
 Care quite a lot.

145
00:06:25,100 --> 00:06:27,060
 Yeah, Dan, that's a big story for those guys.

146
00:06:27,060 --> 00:06:33,740
 I think about the poor delivery guys.

147
00:06:33,740 --> 00:06:40,900
 I was looking into sports at the Winter Olympics that no longer exist, because I remember

148
00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:45,260
 ages ago, we did an actual Summer Olympics episode, and we found some things that used

149
00:06:45,260 --> 00:06:46,260
 to be a part of it.

150
00:06:46,260 --> 00:06:48,180
 There's quite a few good ones as well on this.

151
00:06:48,180 --> 00:06:51,660
 They used to do figure skating on skis today.

152
00:06:51,660 --> 00:06:52,660
 Yeah.

153
00:06:52,660 --> 00:06:55,540
 It was like ski ballet, I think.

154
00:06:55,540 --> 00:07:00,780
 It was either nicknamed or officially called, and so you could use the poles of the cross-country

155
00:07:00,780 --> 00:07:07,060
 skiing poles to do flips and so on, and it featured into Winter Olympics, but no longer

156
00:07:07,060 --> 00:07:08,060
 done.

157
00:07:08,060 --> 00:07:09,060
 Yeah.

158
00:07:09,060 --> 00:07:11,060
 They used to have a medal for mountain climbing.

159
00:07:11,060 --> 00:07:12,060
 Did they?

160
00:07:12,060 --> 00:07:15,220
 Well, they once had an award given out for mountain climbers, at the end of the very first

161
00:07:15,220 --> 00:07:16,220
 Winter Olympics.

162
00:07:16,220 --> 00:07:19,380
 Pierre Coubertin, the father of the Olympics.

163
00:07:19,380 --> 00:07:24,740
 He gave out a medal for Alpinisma, which is mountaineering, to Charles Granville Bruce,

164
00:07:24,740 --> 00:07:28,740
 and he had led an expedition to Mount Everest two years before, and it was to say, "Good

165
00:07:28,740 --> 00:07:29,740
 on you."

166
00:07:29,740 --> 00:07:30,740
 All right.

167
00:07:30,740 --> 00:07:31,740
 It was to say "Good on you" for the Everest thing.

168
00:07:31,740 --> 00:07:33,860
 It wasn't actually because he'd won mountain climbing in that.

169
00:07:33,860 --> 00:07:34,860
 But Wooden Tournament.

170
00:07:34,860 --> 00:07:36,740
 That guy didn't make it to the top of Everest, did he?

171
00:07:36,740 --> 00:07:37,740
 He did not.

172
00:07:37,740 --> 00:07:38,740
 So, why did he get a medal?

173
00:07:38,740 --> 00:07:39,740
 Well, he tried.

174
00:07:39,740 --> 00:07:40,740
 It was a consolation prize.

175
00:07:40,740 --> 00:07:41,740
 Yeah.

176
00:07:41,740 --> 00:07:42,740
 Okay.

177
00:07:42,740 --> 00:07:43,740
 What was his name, sorry?

178
00:07:43,740 --> 00:07:44,740
 Charles Granville Bruce.

179
00:07:44,740 --> 00:07:45,740
 Right, okay.

180
00:07:45,740 --> 00:07:52,860
 The ski drawing used to be a thing, didn't it? It was in the 1928 Olympics in Samarits,

181
00:07:52,860 --> 00:07:55,060
 and it's dog-pulled sledding.

182
00:07:55,060 --> 00:07:56,060
 Yes.

183
00:07:56,060 --> 00:07:58,020
 Where the dogs basically compete on your behalf.

184
00:07:58,020 --> 00:07:59,660
 I don't really know why we don't still do this.

185
00:07:59,660 --> 00:08:03,940
 It seems great, and it's a commonly done thing across kind of Northern Scandinavia.

186
00:08:03,940 --> 00:08:04,940
 It wasn't just dogs.

187
00:08:04,940 --> 00:08:05,940
 It was horses.

188
00:08:05,940 --> 00:08:06,940
 You could be pulled by horses.

189
00:08:06,940 --> 00:08:07,940
 Yeah.

190
00:08:07,940 --> 00:08:08,940
 Would you have dogs against horses?

191
00:08:08,940 --> 00:08:09,940
 I don't know.

192
00:08:09,940 --> 00:08:10,940
 Can you find that out?

193
00:08:10,940 --> 00:08:11,940
 Did you manage to find that out?

194
00:08:11,940 --> 00:08:12,940
 I think you've got to assume that you couldn't.

195
00:08:12,940 --> 00:08:13,940
 No.

196
00:08:13,940 --> 00:08:14,940
 You could have those.

197
00:08:14,940 --> 00:08:15,940
 One of those is going to be better than the other.

198
00:08:15,940 --> 00:08:16,940
 Yeah, exactly.

199
00:08:16,940 --> 00:08:19,340
 Hey, whichever one's better, you wouldn't choose the other one.

200
00:08:19,340 --> 00:08:22,260
 But it only appeared once, and both horses and dogs competed.

201
00:08:22,260 --> 00:08:23,460
 So did they do separate races?

202
00:08:23,460 --> 00:08:24,460
 Was that the dog race?

203
00:08:24,460 --> 00:08:29,820
 You could calculate how many dogs equaled one horse, and then have a rough rule of thumb

204
00:08:29,820 --> 00:08:30,820
 for that.

205
00:08:30,820 --> 00:08:31,820
 Because some horses are better than other horses.

206
00:08:31,820 --> 00:08:35,380
 Yeah, you could have set them ponies against greyhounds, and then, actually, that would

207
00:08:35,380 --> 00:08:36,380
 probably even out.

208
00:08:36,380 --> 00:08:38,940
 I don't think greyhounds are strong enough.

209
00:08:38,940 --> 00:08:40,340
 What if you had 200 greyhounds?

210
00:08:40,340 --> 00:08:43,060
 It's very hard to fit them on the podium.

211
00:08:43,060 --> 00:08:45,300
 I think it's quite important what you've been doing afterwards.

212
00:08:45,300 --> 00:08:47,700
 But then could you just do that with any animals?

213
00:08:47,700 --> 00:08:52,700
 Like with, you know, 5,000 snails off, half an elephant.

214
00:08:52,700 --> 00:08:53,700
 Yeah.

215
00:08:53,700 --> 00:08:54,700
 Half an elephant.

216
00:08:54,700 --> 00:09:01,900
 James, you've come to regret your half an elephant choice, I think.

217
00:09:01,900 --> 00:09:05,300
 Have you guys heard of the ice masters?

218
00:09:05,300 --> 00:09:06,300
 No.

219
00:09:06,300 --> 00:09:07,300
 They're real people.

220
00:09:07,300 --> 00:09:11,140
 And they control the snow and the ice for winter Olympic games.

221
00:09:11,140 --> 00:09:12,140
 Okay.

222
00:09:12,140 --> 00:09:15,380
 But there's an amazing article about them in the Smithsonian.

223
00:09:15,380 --> 00:09:19,820
 And before the games, they will spray onto, like, the bobsled tracks, for example, hundreds

224
00:09:19,820 --> 00:09:22,860
 of paper thin coats of ultra-purified water.

225
00:09:22,860 --> 00:09:27,020
 So it makes it completely smooth, so there are no bubbles, there are no impurities.

226
00:09:27,020 --> 00:09:30,860
 Because you can't just send a zamboni down the loose track.

227
00:09:30,860 --> 00:09:31,860
 And you can't just...

228
00:09:31,860 --> 00:09:32,860
 You can't zamboni it.

229
00:09:32,860 --> 00:09:35,780
 So you can't cheat in the loose.

230
00:09:35,780 --> 00:09:39,500
 And the way that people have cheated in the loose before is by heasing their sleds.

231
00:09:39,500 --> 00:09:44,500
 So in 1968, the East German women's team heated the bottom of their sleds, and so that slightly

232
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:47,220
 melts the snow as you're going down, and it reduces friction.

233
00:09:47,220 --> 00:09:48,220
 Wow.

234
00:09:48,220 --> 00:09:50,500
 But it used to be legal, I think, in the very earliest games.

235
00:09:50,500 --> 00:09:51,500
 It was unorthodox.

236
00:09:51,500 --> 00:09:53,860
 People would call you a maverick, but it wasn't explicitly banned.

237
00:09:53,860 --> 00:09:54,860
 Is that right?

238
00:09:54,860 --> 00:09:55,860
 Yeah.

239
00:09:55,860 --> 00:09:58,700
 Do you know, in golf, you're allowed to heat your balls before the game starts, but you're

240
00:09:58,700 --> 00:10:01,540
 not allowed to artificially heat them during the round.

241
00:10:01,540 --> 00:10:04,300
 What was the advantage of heating your balls in golf?

242
00:10:04,300 --> 00:10:07,940
 Well, you know, they just stick to your thighs left, I guess, though.

243
00:10:07,940 --> 00:10:11,300
 Stick to your thighs.

244
00:10:11,300 --> 00:10:12,300
 Wow.

245
00:10:12,300 --> 00:10:13,300
 That was an issue.

246
00:10:13,300 --> 00:10:20,540
 Turned does a lot of nude golfing.

247
00:10:20,540 --> 00:10:21,540
 They might fly further.

248
00:10:21,540 --> 00:10:22,540
 I don't know.

249
00:10:22,540 --> 00:10:26,500
 I don't think anyone actually does this, but it is technically legal.

250
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:31,660
 What qualifies as artificially heasing them, if they're just in your pocket?

251
00:10:31,660 --> 00:10:32,660
 That's fine.

252
00:10:32,660 --> 00:10:36,660
 Could you tuck them in your armpit?

253
00:10:36,660 --> 00:10:38,580
 It would mess with your stroke, wouldn't it?

254
00:10:38,580 --> 00:10:39,580
 Yeah, it would.

255
00:10:39,580 --> 00:10:41,940
 But your caddy could tuck them in his armpit.

256
00:10:41,940 --> 00:10:42,940
 Yeah.

257
00:10:42,940 --> 00:10:45,820
 The US have heated jackets this year.

258
00:10:45,820 --> 00:10:49,740
 Yeah, Ralph Lauren have designed their jackets, and they've got this super high tech design

259
00:10:49,740 --> 00:10:54,100
 where they contain apparently electronic conductive inks, which are printed inside their

260
00:10:54,100 --> 00:10:58,340
 jacket in the shape of the American flag, and they're attached to a battery pack.

261
00:10:58,340 --> 00:11:02,260
 And so it means that all the US competitors doing drill and fix the room artificially

262
00:11:02,260 --> 00:11:03,260
 heat it.

263
00:11:03,260 --> 00:11:10,220
 He don't wish harm on anyone, but I really, if those batteries do happen to overheat the

264
00:11:10,220 --> 00:11:11,220
 satellite.

265
00:11:11,220 --> 00:11:17,060
 Oh, imagine just having a massive American flag stars and stripes tattoo on your bag.

266
00:11:17,060 --> 00:11:18,060
 What happened?

267
00:11:18,060 --> 00:11:19,060
 Ralph Lauren happened.

268
00:11:19,060 --> 00:11:20,060
 Yeah.

269
00:11:20,060 --> 00:11:22,900
 That's quite nice though, because if everyone's outside having a cigarette, can everyone

270
00:11:22,900 --> 00:11:25,500
 just gather around the Americans to get heat off them?

271
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:33,140
 I'm not sure during the Winter Olympics everyone goes outside for a cigarette.

272
00:11:33,140 --> 00:11:40,920
 You know Eddie the Eagle, our British celebrity who competed in the 1988 Olympics for anyone

273
00:11:40,920 --> 00:11:45,620
 who doesn't know, and he was the only ski jumper to have competed for the UK, and he was

274
00:11:45,620 --> 00:11:46,620
 terrible.

275
00:11:46,620 --> 00:11:49,540
 He meant they had to change the rules of the Olympics to make sure such terrible people

276
00:11:49,540 --> 00:11:51,860
 couldn't qualify in future.

277
00:11:51,860 --> 00:11:55,900
 But he was a plasterer when he entered, and he still works as a plasterer in Stroud.

278
00:11:55,900 --> 00:11:56,900
 Cool.

279
00:11:56,900 --> 00:11:57,900
 Which I just find so weird.

280
00:11:57,900 --> 00:12:00,860
 He's such a known name to everyone in Britain.

281
00:12:00,860 --> 00:12:03,580
 He's just hanging out in Stroud being a plasterer.

282
00:12:03,580 --> 00:12:08,060
 Must be weird to have a life where you're just a plasterer all the time, and then just for

283
00:12:08,060 --> 00:12:12,080
 two months, you're the most famous person in the whole of Britain, and you go to the Olympics

284
00:12:12,080 --> 00:12:13,580
 and then you were plasterer again.

285
00:12:13,580 --> 00:12:14,580
 So was that.

286
00:12:14,580 --> 00:12:17,940
 So when they made that movie of him, do you think he arrived at the cinema thinking, finally,

287
00:12:17,940 --> 00:12:20,340
 my plastering career is going to see it.

288
00:12:20,340 --> 00:12:21,340
 Oh, what?

289
00:12:21,340 --> 00:12:22,340
 They picked that one.

290
00:12:22,340 --> 00:12:23,340
 A fan?

291
00:12:23,340 --> 00:12:31,260
 OK, there's time for fact number two, and that is Chazinski.

292
00:12:31,260 --> 00:12:37,820
 My fact this week is that Canada has a strategic maple syrup reserve, and in 2012, a quarter

293
00:12:37,820 --> 00:12:40,900
 of the maple syrup in it was stolen.

294
00:12:40,900 --> 00:12:41,900
 And I love this.

295
00:12:41,900 --> 00:12:47,220
 I only just found out about this, but this is in Quebec, so Canada tapped 75% at least

296
00:12:47,220 --> 00:12:49,820
 of the global supply of maple syrup.

297
00:12:49,820 --> 00:12:51,820
 And so it provides a lot of jobs for people.

298
00:12:51,820 --> 00:12:55,140
 And so in the same way that there needs to be an oil reserve in the US, because the fluctuations

299
00:12:55,140 --> 00:13:00,580
 in the market, or if the maple trees suddenly die or whatever in Canada, they have a massive

300
00:13:00,580 --> 00:13:05,300
 reserve, so that the prices can stay stable and so that the supply can stay stable.

301
00:13:05,300 --> 00:13:07,540
 Stable or artificially high?

302
00:13:07,540 --> 00:13:08,700
 Or artificially high.

303
00:13:08,700 --> 00:13:13,940
 If you believe the whole cartel, this is a mafia kind of argument, which some do.

304
00:13:13,940 --> 00:13:14,940
 Some do.

305
00:13:14,940 --> 00:13:15,940
 I don't.

306
00:13:15,940 --> 00:13:16,940
 No, no.

307
00:13:16,940 --> 00:13:17,940
 You wouldn't want to get in trouble with those guys.

308
00:13:17,940 --> 00:13:23,220
 This was the largest theft ever investigated by Quebec police in their entire history.

309
00:13:23,220 --> 00:13:26,300
 That's kind of nice that it got to be something, a local product, isn't it?

310
00:13:26,300 --> 00:13:27,300
 Yeah.

311
00:13:27,300 --> 00:13:28,300
 Yeah.

312
00:13:28,300 --> 00:13:29,300
 Yeah.

313
00:13:29,300 --> 00:13:32,900
 It was $30 million worth was stolen, which I think was about 6,000 barrels.

314
00:13:32,900 --> 00:13:33,900
 6,000 barrels.

315
00:13:33,900 --> 00:13:39,180
 It was enough maple syrup to put one tablespoon on 183 million flapjacks.

316
00:13:39,180 --> 00:13:40,180
 OK.

317
00:13:40,180 --> 00:13:42,300
 Would you put maple syrup on a flapjack?

318
00:13:42,300 --> 00:13:46,020
 I think that maybe, now I read that, because I thought it said pancakes, and then I read

319
00:13:46,020 --> 00:13:47,020
 it, and it said flapjacks.

320
00:13:47,020 --> 00:13:48,940
 So, there are two options here.

321
00:13:48,940 --> 00:13:50,900
 One, I've written down the wrong word.

322
00:13:50,900 --> 00:13:54,500
 More likely, I've copy-pasted that word, and the word flapjack means something different

323
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:55,500
 in colour.

324
00:13:55,500 --> 00:13:56,500
 Ah.

325
00:13:56,500 --> 00:13:58,260
 Anyway, there are these guys.

326
00:13:58,260 --> 00:14:04,100
 The federation-de-product-aerical de Quebec, which is, as you say, the syrup produces union.

327
00:14:04,100 --> 00:14:05,500
 And basically, they do.

328
00:14:05,500 --> 00:14:06,900
 They run the whole show.

329
00:14:06,900 --> 00:14:11,020
 You're not legally allowed to sell maple syrup to anyone except them.

330
00:14:11,020 --> 00:14:15,260
 And then they stockpile it, so that if the farmers have a really good year, buying

331
00:14:15,260 --> 00:14:18,460
 it, can't buy it really, really cheaply, and then screw the farmers over the next season.

332
00:14:18,460 --> 00:14:21,340
 However, a lot of farmers want freedom to stop doing that.

333
00:14:21,340 --> 00:14:25,180
 They do, because they can do things like, I didn't quite realise that this is how cartels

334
00:14:25,180 --> 00:14:30,300
 work, but the farmers don't get paid until the stockpilers have actually sold their syrup.

335
00:14:30,300 --> 00:14:33,460
 So, if they just decide that there's been a lot of maple syrup made that year, so they're

336
00:14:33,460 --> 00:14:36,300
 not going to sell a very high proportion of it, then the farmers aren't going to get

337
00:14:36,300 --> 00:14:39,700
 paid for their maple syrup until it's gone out into the market, which does seem a bit

338
00:14:39,700 --> 00:14:40,700
 frustrating.

339
00:14:40,700 --> 00:14:46,860
 And haven't they done what happened in America in 2002, a farmer called Marvin Horn decided

340
00:14:46,860 --> 00:14:49,860
 that he was not going to hand over his raisins anymore?

341
00:14:49,860 --> 00:14:56,820
 So the government, since World War II, had been stockpiling excess raisins from farmers,

342
00:14:56,820 --> 00:15:01,540
 because the market was flooded, basically, with raisins, and they didn't know what to do.

343
00:15:01,540 --> 00:15:07,220
 So they stopped farmers had to give any extra raisins that they had just over to the government.

344
00:15:07,220 --> 00:15:11,180
 And this guy, Marvin Horn, he said he wasn't going to hand them over anymore.

345
00:15:11,180 --> 00:15:14,980
 The government sued him for $680,000, but he won the case in the end.

346
00:15:14,980 --> 00:15:18,820
 Yeah, we won off to 13 years of grinding lawsuits in legal battles.

347
00:15:18,820 --> 00:15:19,820
 I mean, I know.

348
00:15:19,820 --> 00:15:21,740
 Well, doesn't everyone just do that?

349
00:15:21,740 --> 00:15:27,020
 There just needs to be one tree sapon farmer who's going to spend 13 years for the cause

350
00:15:27,020 --> 00:15:28,260
 of maple syrup in Canada.

351
00:15:28,260 --> 00:15:29,260
 I guess.

352
00:15:29,260 --> 00:15:31,540
 I think no one really wants to be the first one to do that.

353
00:15:31,540 --> 00:15:33,540
 But the raisin reserve is unbelievable.

354
00:15:33,540 --> 00:15:34,540
 Yeah, wow.

355
00:15:34,540 --> 00:15:35,540
 It's a real thing.

356
00:15:35,540 --> 00:15:36,540
 And it's still excess.

357
00:15:36,540 --> 00:15:38,780
 They're not even sure if they're going to go back to doing it, because this lawsuit has

358
00:15:38,780 --> 00:15:42,300
 thrown up everything up in the air, and they might cancel it now.

359
00:15:42,300 --> 00:15:43,300
 Wow.

360
00:15:43,300 --> 00:15:45,100
 I can't believe there's been a massive raisin stockpile.

361
00:15:45,100 --> 00:15:48,260
 Well, this is why this huge theft of all the maple syrup happened as well.

362
00:15:48,260 --> 00:15:52,780
 It's groups who are kind of objecting to this mafia-like hold they have over the market.

363
00:15:52,780 --> 00:15:57,700
 And it's discovered in July 2012 when they just did a routine check of this massive reserve.

364
00:15:57,700 --> 00:16:00,900
 And they realised that one of the barrels kind of tipped over too easily, and they looked

365
00:16:00,900 --> 00:16:02,700
 inside it, and they realised it was empty.

366
00:16:02,700 --> 00:16:07,500
 And then they inspected all the barrels and so many loads of them were filled with water.

367
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:11,860
 And they realised that somehow someone had been siphoning out maple syrup, and they found

368
00:16:11,860 --> 00:16:16,060
 the people eventually who'd done it, and it turned out they'd hired some space out in

369
00:16:16,060 --> 00:16:20,740
 the big storage in the big warehouse, and they'd just been gradually siphoning the maple

370
00:16:20,740 --> 00:16:21,740
 syrup out.

371
00:16:21,740 --> 00:16:25,100
 So when you siphon petrol, you have to suck a little bit out, don't you?

372
00:16:25,100 --> 00:16:26,420
 And then you spit it out of your mouth.

373
00:16:26,420 --> 00:16:31,660
 I only know this from movies, and then you can siphon it by using the physics of siphons.

374
00:16:31,660 --> 00:16:32,660
 Yes.

375
00:16:32,660 --> 00:16:34,460
 And it's the same with maple syrup.

376
00:16:34,460 --> 00:16:36,260
 And if so, would you spit it out, probably not?

377
00:16:36,260 --> 00:16:37,260
 No.

378
00:16:37,260 --> 00:16:39,260
 You spit it out, but only onto a nearby pancake.

379
00:16:39,260 --> 00:16:40,260
 Or flapjack.

380
00:16:40,260 --> 00:16:41,260
 Or flapjack.

381
00:16:41,260 --> 00:16:48,220
 And the other thing is, once you steal all these barrels of maple syrup, what do you do?

382
00:16:48,220 --> 00:16:50,260
 Is there like a black market of maple syrup?

383
00:16:50,260 --> 00:16:51,260
 Yes.

384
00:16:51,260 --> 00:16:53,340
 A guy down the pub says, I've got a barrel here.

385
00:16:53,340 --> 00:16:54,340
 Yes.

386
00:16:54,340 --> 00:16:55,340
 There's a big black market.

387
00:16:55,340 --> 00:16:56,340
 That's what the rebels do.

388
00:16:56,340 --> 00:17:00,220
 Yeah, the black market maple syrup dealing is an issue in Canada, and that's how people

389
00:17:00,220 --> 00:17:01,220
 are getting around it.

390
00:17:01,220 --> 00:17:02,220
 So there are quite a few.

391
00:17:02,220 --> 00:17:03,220
 That's interesting.

392
00:17:03,220 --> 00:17:08,980
 Apparently, the price of a barrel of maple syrup is around $2,000, 13 times the price

393
00:17:08,980 --> 00:17:09,980
 of crude oil.

394
00:17:09,980 --> 00:17:10,980
 Wow.

395
00:17:10,980 --> 00:17:12,860
 So it's extremely expensive.

396
00:17:12,860 --> 00:17:14,820
 And tastier to suck out of a siphon?

397
00:17:14,820 --> 00:17:18,260
 Yes, but less good for running a car.

398
00:17:18,260 --> 00:17:19,260
 Yep.

399
00:17:19,260 --> 00:17:22,020
 They both got their advantages and disadvantages.

400
00:17:22,020 --> 00:17:24,580
 It would be a boring world if we were all alike.

401
00:17:24,580 --> 00:17:26,300
 But here's a thing.

402
00:17:26,300 --> 00:17:32,140
 If you are showing some pancakes or flapjacks on television for an advert, you want

403
00:17:32,140 --> 00:17:33,460
 to put maple syrup on it.

404
00:17:33,460 --> 00:17:38,060
 They often use motor oil because it looks better on camera than maple syrup.

405
00:17:38,060 --> 00:17:44,540
 But what about the demonstrator lady who then has to start eating it?

406
00:17:44,540 --> 00:17:45,540
 You see her.

407
00:17:45,540 --> 00:17:49,980
 You see her take it and she shoves it into a car to exhaust the fire.

408
00:17:49,980 --> 00:17:52,580
 Is that what you do with your motor oil?

409
00:17:52,580 --> 00:17:54,180
 My car doesn't work.

410
00:17:54,180 --> 00:17:59,500
 It's really weird.

411
00:17:59,500 --> 00:18:02,020
 So maple syrup, I didn't really know that you

412
00:18:02,020 --> 00:18:05,180
 could just cut into the side of a tree and it just comes out.

413
00:18:05,180 --> 00:18:06,180
 Not any old tree.

414
00:18:06,180 --> 00:18:07,180
 A good point.

415
00:18:07,180 --> 00:18:08,540
 That has to be a maple tree.

416
00:18:08,540 --> 00:18:09,540
 Yes.

417
00:18:09,540 --> 00:18:10,740
 With though, isn't it?

418
00:18:10,740 --> 00:18:11,740
 Yeah.

419
00:18:11,740 --> 00:18:15,500
 It's because trees store it in their roots for winter and then they convert it to sugar.

420
00:18:15,500 --> 00:18:18,540
 They store starch and then they convert it to sugar and then that's the sap.

421
00:18:18,540 --> 00:18:23,260
 And then you have to concentrate it about 50 times because it just comes out as a much

422
00:18:23,260 --> 00:18:25,140
 thinner liquid.

423
00:18:25,140 --> 00:18:28,100
 And the Algonquian aborigines would concentrate it.

424
00:18:28,100 --> 00:18:31,980
 They would either drop a hot stone in so that boils off the liquid or they would

425
00:18:31,980 --> 00:18:36,740
 let the sap freeze overnight and then at the top all the water has turned to ice and you

426
00:18:36,740 --> 00:18:37,740
 just get rid of the ice.

427
00:18:37,740 --> 00:18:38,740
 Wow.

428
00:18:38,740 --> 00:18:39,740
 Concentrated maple syrup.

429
00:18:39,740 --> 00:18:40,740
 That's so cool.

430
00:18:40,740 --> 00:18:41,740
 Wow.

431
00:18:41,740 --> 00:18:42,740
 And then that's it.

432
00:18:42,740 --> 00:18:43,740
 That's just as good as.

433
00:18:43,740 --> 00:18:46,660
 I think you have to look quite a lot of times to get it because these days it's really

434
00:18:46,660 --> 00:18:47,660
 concentrated stuff.

435
00:18:47,660 --> 00:18:48,660
 Yeah.

436
00:18:48,660 --> 00:18:49,660
 It's 66% sugar.

437
00:18:49,660 --> 00:18:52,260
 But you can only do it at certain times of the year, can't you?

438
00:18:52,260 --> 00:18:57,940
 You can only do it when it's freezing during the night time and warm during the day.

439
00:18:57,940 --> 00:19:02,300
 So that's when the sap starts flowing up and down and that's when it will tap out.

440
00:19:02,300 --> 00:19:06,380
 And I think that's why the reserve is so important because it has these really specific conditions

441
00:19:06,380 --> 00:19:09,820
 that it flourishes in so it's really easy to have a bad season.

442
00:19:09,820 --> 00:19:13,140
 But they've invented this amazing new way of getting maple syrup out which is actually

443
00:19:13,140 --> 00:19:17,780
 going to increase the yield they think tenfold when they master it and it's vacuuming.

444
00:19:17,780 --> 00:19:22,820
 So what they've done is they've attached vacuum vacuums to these maple trees and then they

445
00:19:22,820 --> 00:19:26,300
 connect all the vacuums with a pipe and it sucks the syrup out.

446
00:19:26,300 --> 00:19:30,580
 But it's incredible, it literally sucks the sugar almost straight up out of the ground.

447
00:19:30,580 --> 00:19:33,340
 So someone described it as being like a sugar straw.

448
00:19:33,340 --> 00:19:37,820
 So it basically is a way of sucking all the stuff out of the ground and then the tree turns

449
00:19:37,820 --> 00:19:41,060
 it kind of into the syrup that you want on the way up and then you can dump it in your

450
00:19:41,060 --> 00:19:42,060
 big bag.

451
00:19:42,060 --> 00:19:43,940
 It feels very unnatural that to me.

452
00:19:43,940 --> 00:19:44,940
 It's not authentic, is it?

453
00:19:44,940 --> 00:19:45,940
 No.

454
00:19:45,940 --> 00:19:46,940
 It feels sad for the tree.

455
00:19:46,940 --> 00:19:47,940
 It must be bad for something.

456
00:19:47,940 --> 00:19:48,940
 It must be bad for something.

457
00:19:48,940 --> 00:19:49,940
 Yeah.

458
00:19:49,940 --> 00:19:50,940
 It doesn't sound sustainable, does it?

459
00:19:50,940 --> 00:19:53,660
 Because the old method where you just drill a hole in and then people just hang

460
00:19:53,660 --> 00:19:56,740
 plastic bags off, and it just drains down.

461
00:19:56,740 --> 00:19:57,740
 We just leave a bucket.

462
00:19:57,740 --> 00:19:58,740
 Or a bucket.

463
00:19:58,740 --> 00:19:59,740
 It's a leak.

464
00:19:59,740 --> 00:20:01,700
 Does that feel natural to you, James?

465
00:20:01,700 --> 00:20:03,180
 Well, drilling...

466
00:20:03,180 --> 00:20:05,540
 James just eats the tree.

467
00:20:05,540 --> 00:20:09,380
 I think drilling is slightly unnatural, but I think attaching a massive vacuum cleaner

468
00:20:09,380 --> 00:20:11,300
 to something is the next level.

469
00:20:11,300 --> 00:20:12,300
 You're right.

470
00:20:12,300 --> 00:20:15,260
 Yeah, it's a few levels above, I would say.

471
00:20:15,260 --> 00:20:22,180
 China has more than 200,000 tons of frozen pork.

472
00:20:22,180 --> 00:20:26,700
 It's kind of hanging around, and that's because they do the same thing as Canada is doing with

473
00:20:26,700 --> 00:20:27,860
 its maple syrup.

474
00:20:27,860 --> 00:20:32,820
 So they have a strategic pork supply, and that's because they have more pigs than the next

475
00:20:32,820 --> 00:20:35,100
 40 pork producing countries combined.

476
00:20:35,100 --> 00:20:36,100
 Next 40?

477
00:20:36,100 --> 00:20:37,100
 Yeah.

478
00:20:37,100 --> 00:20:40,940
 And they're so massively dependent on this one commodity because loads, like some people

479
00:20:40,940 --> 00:20:46,420
 it's like 70% of the protein comes from pork, and so they need to keep the prices steady,

480
00:20:46,420 --> 00:20:49,060
 and this is one of the best ways to keep prices steady.

481
00:20:49,060 --> 00:20:51,580
 And they needed it actually in 2016, didn't they?

482
00:20:51,580 --> 00:20:52,580
 They really had to draw on it.

483
00:20:52,580 --> 00:20:54,180
 Yeah, they had a pork issue.

484
00:20:54,180 --> 00:20:55,180
 A pig issue.

485
00:20:55,180 --> 00:20:56,180
 What happened?

486
00:20:56,180 --> 00:20:57,180
 Pork coca lips.

487
00:20:57,180 --> 00:20:58,180
 Pork coca lips.

488
00:20:58,180 --> 00:20:59,180
 Yeah, sure.

489
00:20:59,180 --> 00:21:00,180
 A pork coca lips.

490
00:21:00,180 --> 00:21:01,180
 Pork coca lips.

491
00:21:01,180 --> 00:21:03,980
 Pork coca lips is better.

492
00:21:03,980 --> 00:21:13,540
 America sort of similarly has a reserve of helium because, in 1921, they thought the blimp

493
00:21:13,540 --> 00:21:18,980
 was going to be the ultimate war weapon for them, so they built these huge factories

494
00:21:18,980 --> 00:21:22,660
 for all the helium that they were keeping for their blimps, but they got rid of the blimps,

495
00:21:22,660 --> 00:21:26,500
 but they kept the helium, so they still have in Amarillo, Texas.

496
00:21:26,500 --> 00:21:32,180
 There's an 11 billion cubic feet reserve of helium that they've kept, and it's just

497
00:21:32,180 --> 00:21:33,180
 there.

498
00:21:33,180 --> 00:21:34,180
 It's just waiting.

499
00:21:34,180 --> 00:21:37,100
 But it's embarrassing, I think, for the people who were initially working on it when

500
00:21:37,100 --> 00:21:38,100
 they were asked what they did.

501
00:21:38,100 --> 00:21:41,220
 And they'd say, I worked for the military during helium, and then 10 years later, it was,

502
00:21:41,220 --> 00:21:42,220
 I worked for children's birthday parties.

503
00:21:42,220 --> 00:21:43,220
 Yeah.

504
00:21:43,220 --> 00:21:44,220
 It's a regular helium.

505
00:21:44,220 --> 00:21:49,860
 The kind of clowns we've seen leaving with a reserve, the biggest ice to the century.

506
00:21:49,860 --> 00:21:54,340
 How many, how much helium do you think you'd have to inhale before you could float away out

507
00:21:54,340 --> 00:21:55,340
 of the helium?

508
00:21:55,340 --> 00:21:56,340
 Too much.

509
00:21:56,340 --> 00:21:57,340
 Too much.

510
00:21:57,340 --> 00:21:58,340
 Too much.

511
00:21:58,340 --> 00:21:59,340
 An unhealthy amount, you know.

512
00:21:59,340 --> 00:22:01,860
 Yeah, I think you need to pump it your body full of it, basically.

513
00:22:01,860 --> 00:22:02,860
 Okay.

514
00:22:02,860 --> 00:22:03,860
 Hey, we need to move on.

515
00:22:03,860 --> 00:22:04,860
 We need to move on.

516
00:22:04,860 --> 00:22:05,860
 Just one, I think.

517
00:22:05,860 --> 00:22:06,860
 Yeah.

518
00:22:06,860 --> 00:22:11,580
 So the EU famously, especially in the '80s, had butter mountains and wine lakes for exactly

519
00:22:11,580 --> 00:22:13,220
 the same reason.

520
00:22:13,220 --> 00:22:17,060
 There was a building in Wiltshire that was holding enough butter to spread on 50 million

521
00:22:17,060 --> 00:22:23,220
 slices of toast, and the Monster Raving Looney party suggested that we should turn it into

522
00:22:23,220 --> 00:22:27,780
 a butter mountain, turn the butter mountain into a ski slope for Eddie the Eagle to practice

523
00:22:27,780 --> 00:22:28,780
 on.

524
00:22:28,780 --> 00:22:29,780
 Oh.

525
00:22:29,780 --> 00:22:30,780
 Oh, because of the soft landing.

526
00:22:30,780 --> 00:22:31,780
 Because it was a butterfly.

527
00:22:31,780 --> 00:22:36,980
 It was a bit like snow, because it's a mountain, bit like snow, and he needed somewhere

528
00:22:36,980 --> 00:22:37,980
 to practice.

529
00:22:37,980 --> 00:22:40,860
 Yeah, but I just also think that butter would be a really nice substance to fall on.

530
00:22:40,860 --> 00:22:45,100
 Just try and impose logic on the Monster Raving Looney party policy platform.

531
00:22:45,100 --> 00:22:47,860
 You're right.

532
00:22:47,860 --> 00:22:57,900
 Okay, it is time for fact number three, and that is Andy.

533
00:22:57,900 --> 00:23:02,380
 My fact is that when Russia invaded Finland in 1940, they were so convinced that they will

534
00:23:02,380 --> 00:23:08,820
 be welcomed with a celebration that they took musical instruments with them as they invaded.

535
00:23:08,820 --> 00:23:09,820
 And they were not.

536
00:23:09,820 --> 00:23:10,820
 No.

537
00:23:10,820 --> 00:23:11,820
 No.

538
00:23:11,820 --> 00:23:13,180
 So this is a thing called the Winter War.

539
00:23:13,180 --> 00:23:18,220
 It was between the Soviet Union and Finland, and it was part of the Second World War.

540
00:23:18,220 --> 00:23:21,940
 So the Second World War was in full swing, and the Soviet Union had, I think, wanted a bit

541
00:23:21,940 --> 00:23:24,060
 of Finnish territory.

542
00:23:24,060 --> 00:23:29,100
 And Finland said, no, we don't want to lease you this land or all for you to have it.

543
00:23:29,100 --> 00:23:30,820
 So Russia invaded.

544
00:23:30,820 --> 00:23:34,260
 And it was this very, very asymmetrical war.

545
00:23:34,260 --> 00:23:35,580
 Soviet Union had a lot of resources.

546
00:23:35,580 --> 00:23:37,340
 Finland had almost none.

547
00:23:37,340 --> 00:23:43,700
 And all right, the Soviet Union did win the war, sure, but they managed to really drag out

548
00:23:43,700 --> 00:23:44,700
 the campaign.

549
00:23:44,700 --> 00:23:47,060
 And they lost way more people.

550
00:23:47,060 --> 00:23:49,620
 I think they lost five times as many troops in the Winter War, didn't they?

551
00:23:49,620 --> 00:23:50,620
 The Soviet Union.

552
00:23:50,620 --> 00:23:51,620
 Yeah, the Soviet Union.

553
00:23:51,620 --> 00:23:52,620
 And it was a disaster for them.

554
00:23:52,620 --> 00:23:56,480
 It was one of those was that they, maybe they officially won it, because in the end, Finland

555
00:23:56,480 --> 00:24:00,980
 had to seed this bit of land that they wanted, but it was a disaster because they hadn't

556
00:24:00,980 --> 00:24:02,300
 expected it to be so rough.

557
00:24:02,300 --> 00:24:05,700
 Which is weird, because the main thing they weren't expecting, according to all accounts,

558
00:24:05,700 --> 00:24:08,420
 was the terrible weather and the freezing cold.

559
00:24:08,420 --> 00:24:11,100
 But you would have thought, I mean, that's what everyone else, the problem everyone else

560
00:24:11,100 --> 00:24:12,940
 stumbled into when invading Russia.

561
00:24:12,940 --> 00:24:16,500
 So you would have thought the Russians would know and be prepared.

562
00:24:16,500 --> 00:24:18,820
 Would they probably thought like a winter Olympian?

563
00:24:18,820 --> 00:24:19,820
 Good.

564
00:24:19,820 --> 00:24:20,820
 I know cold.

565
00:24:20,820 --> 00:24:22,300
 How cold is that going to be?

566
00:24:22,300 --> 00:24:24,060
 They probably thought they had it covered.

567
00:24:24,060 --> 00:24:25,060
 And it was another level.

568
00:24:25,060 --> 00:24:26,060
 Yeah.

569
00:24:26,060 --> 00:24:29,420
 I was reading into the Winter War and knew nothing about it.

570
00:24:29,420 --> 00:24:33,740
 And you know, when you do this kind of research, your eyes get sort of caught by things

571
00:24:33,740 --> 00:24:37,220
 like sausage war and you think, oh, that's going to be funny.

572
00:24:37,220 --> 00:24:39,420
 And it's not because it's war.

573
00:24:39,420 --> 00:24:45,540
 And basically what it was is the Soviets had managed to get into Finnish enemy lines and

574
00:24:45,540 --> 00:24:47,540
 snuck up on them from behind.

575
00:24:47,540 --> 00:24:51,300
 And so they caught them completely off guard and they were taking out a lot of their troops

576
00:24:51,300 --> 00:24:52,980
 as they were heading towards their camp.

577
00:24:52,980 --> 00:24:57,980
 But from the direction they came, they arrived at the bit of camp where the chefs had just

578
00:24:57,980 --> 00:25:00,180
 been making a massive meal for all of the troops.

579
00:25:00,180 --> 00:25:03,940
 So it was a ginormous tent full of just freshly made sausages.

580
00:25:03,940 --> 00:25:09,340
 And these poor soldiers who'd been starved and were freezing were so taken by the smell

581
00:25:09,340 --> 00:25:14,180
 and the fact that they'd not eaten that they just went in and they ate all of the sausages.

582
00:25:14,180 --> 00:25:17,860
 And while that was happening, the Finnish troops were able to regroup and get back in time

583
00:25:17,860 --> 00:25:18,860
 to defend it.

584
00:25:18,860 --> 00:25:21,260
 So no one officially, I think, won it necessarily.

585
00:25:21,260 --> 00:25:22,740
 It's just a little episode in the...

586
00:25:22,740 --> 00:25:25,500
 I think the Soviets got completely routed, didn't they?

587
00:25:25,500 --> 00:25:26,500
 Yeah.

588
00:25:26,500 --> 00:25:27,500
 That is quite funny.

589
00:25:27,500 --> 00:25:31,180
 But they kind of lost because they were too busy mongering sausages.

590
00:25:31,180 --> 00:25:32,460
 Yeah, I know the war, though.

591
00:25:32,460 --> 00:25:33,460
 It's a skirmish.

592
00:25:33,460 --> 00:25:34,460
 It's a sausage skirmish.

593
00:25:34,460 --> 00:25:35,460
 A sausage skirmish.

594
00:25:35,460 --> 00:25:36,460
 Yeah.

595
00:25:36,460 --> 00:25:39,860
 Do you know that the Finnish had saunas on the front line?

596
00:25:39,860 --> 00:25:40,860
 No.

597
00:25:40,860 --> 00:25:41,860
 Get out.

598
00:25:41,860 --> 00:25:46,660
 They took every Finnish soldier for every two or three days was allowed to go to one of

599
00:25:46,660 --> 00:25:47,660
 the saunas.

600
00:25:47,660 --> 00:25:50,700
 They wanted to carry the saunas with them as they were in front.

601
00:25:50,700 --> 00:25:54,820
 So they had a few mobile saunas, which I guess, probably on wheels.

602
00:25:54,820 --> 00:25:57,060
 I'm guessing about that or skis.

603
00:25:57,060 --> 00:26:01,540
 And they also utilized the saunas in villages around Finland.

604
00:26:01,540 --> 00:26:02,540
 Cool.

605
00:26:02,540 --> 00:26:06,420
 And it was really good, not just because it was saunas and Finnish people of saunas, but

606
00:26:06,420 --> 00:26:09,900
 also because it prevented frostbites and it helped kill bacteria.

607
00:26:09,900 --> 00:26:14,220
 So they didn't have nearly as many problems medically as the Russians did for that reason.

608
00:26:14,220 --> 00:26:15,220
 Oh, clever.

609
00:26:15,220 --> 00:26:16,220
 That's very good.

610
00:26:16,220 --> 00:26:17,900
 It was a guerrilla war, basically.

611
00:26:17,900 --> 00:26:18,900
 Yes.

612
00:26:18,900 --> 00:26:21,940
 And they took advantage of the fact, like in loads of guerrilla wars, the infrastructure

613
00:26:21,940 --> 00:26:22,940
 wasn't really there.

614
00:26:22,940 --> 00:26:24,540
 So there were very few roads into Finland.

615
00:26:24,540 --> 00:26:28,220
 And either side of the roads that you had, we incredibly thick forest.

616
00:26:28,220 --> 00:26:32,180
 So you would have a column of tanks and you might mind the road, so then the tanks have

617
00:26:32,180 --> 00:26:36,140
 to stop because one of the front ones has been damaged.

618
00:26:36,140 --> 00:26:39,860
 And then from that point on, the Finns just kind of appeared through the woodlands and

619
00:26:39,860 --> 00:26:43,460
 constantly, you know, harassed the Soviet troops.

620
00:26:43,460 --> 00:26:44,460
 On skis, mostly.

621
00:26:44,460 --> 00:26:45,460
 On skis.

622
00:26:45,460 --> 00:26:49,300
 And they were much better skis because they had trained to ski because they didn't have

623
00:26:49,300 --> 00:26:50,300
 this infrastructure at all.

624
00:26:50,300 --> 00:26:51,780
 So that's the only way you could get through.

625
00:26:51,780 --> 00:26:55,860
 I think the Soviets were just taught to wear skis, stand up, fire a gun, whereas the Finns

626
00:26:55,860 --> 00:26:57,460
 could actually dart about.

627
00:26:57,460 --> 00:27:00,900
 And the Soviet skis were just kind of ones that they kind of cobbled together, whereas the

628
00:27:00,900 --> 00:27:03,180
 Finnish people were all using their own skis.

629
00:27:03,180 --> 00:27:07,980
 And so the Soviet skis were so bad that when the Finnish kind of captured them, they just

630
00:27:07,980 --> 00:27:09,860
 were no use and they just used them for firewood.

631
00:27:09,860 --> 00:27:10,860
 Oh, really?

632
00:27:10,860 --> 00:27:11,860
 Sorry.

633
00:27:11,860 --> 00:27:12,860
 Wow.

634
00:27:12,860 --> 00:27:16,020
 And at the Winter Olympics, people have been throwing away their skis, haven't they?

635
00:27:16,020 --> 00:27:17,020
 Have they?

636
00:27:17,020 --> 00:27:18,020
 Yeah.

637
00:27:18,020 --> 00:27:19,020
 Oh, yeah, because it's too cold.

638
00:27:19,020 --> 00:27:25,140
 Apparently, the first time you try skis on practice runs, one of the coaches said that they

639
00:27:25,140 --> 00:27:28,620
 just turned to garbage the skis because they get damaged by it being too cold.

640
00:27:28,620 --> 00:27:29,620
 It warps.

641
00:27:29,620 --> 00:27:32,540
 So there's snow at his, I think, and then it's too cold and it warps the ski.

642
00:27:32,540 --> 00:27:33,540
 Wow.

643
00:27:33,540 --> 00:27:34,540
 Yeah.

644
00:27:34,540 --> 00:27:39,400
 I was just looking at wars where people have had way too high expectations that have turned

645
00:27:39,400 --> 00:27:40,400
 out to be wrong.

646
00:27:40,400 --> 00:27:45,100
 So these guys in Finland, you know, they had this band because they really thought that

647
00:27:45,100 --> 00:27:46,100
 they'd got the victory.

648
00:27:46,100 --> 00:27:47,100
 Yeah.

649
00:27:47,100 --> 00:27:52,180
 So, literally, in the ball war, I was reading about when British soldiers in the second ball

650
00:27:52,180 --> 00:27:57,020
 war were, they mounted this to this really good strategic point called Sion Kopp and it

651
00:27:57,020 --> 00:28:01,420
 was this hill and they got up quite easily and they realized there were very few casualties

652
00:28:01,420 --> 00:28:03,060
 and they were fighting the balls on all sides.

653
00:28:03,060 --> 00:28:06,340
 They made it to the top of this hill and it was brilliant and they thought we've like

654
00:28:06,340 --> 00:28:08,260
 achieved this massive victory.

655
00:28:08,260 --> 00:28:09,260
 We're going to be fine.

656
00:28:09,260 --> 00:28:12,940
 The leader of those troops and a message back to the general saying he could expect his

657
00:28:12,940 --> 00:28:17,580
 position to be held until Doomsday against all comers because they were at the peak of this

658
00:28:17,580 --> 00:28:21,260
 really important hill and they dug trenches in, planned to stay there.

659
00:28:21,260 --> 00:28:26,140
 So that was in the evening and there was a big fog hanging over them and the next morning

660
00:28:26,140 --> 00:28:30,060
 the fog lifted and it was one of those things where you think it's the peak of a mountain

661
00:28:30,060 --> 00:28:34,780
 but then the fog lifts and there's actually loads more peaks around and the fog lifted

662
00:28:34,780 --> 00:28:39,060
 and there were three more peaks on all sides and all the balls just sitting on them waiting

663
00:28:39,060 --> 00:28:42,500
 to get down at them going, you bunch of idiots.

664
00:28:42,500 --> 00:28:49,700
 And that is where the name of the cop Liverpool's football ground, one of the stands is called

665
00:28:49,700 --> 00:28:50,700
 the cop.

666
00:28:50,700 --> 00:28:53,460
 Because it was originally there.

667
00:28:53,460 --> 00:28:55,460
 That's amazing.

668
00:28:55,460 --> 00:29:01,220
 A lot of stadiums were built around this time, was it late 19th century, wasn't it?

669
00:29:01,220 --> 00:29:05,740
 It was kind of, this was a slanted bit of land and all these places where people were watching

670
00:29:05,740 --> 00:29:09,220
 football from was slanted bits of land so there were a few of them were named cops and

671
00:29:09,220 --> 00:29:11,180
 Liverpool's the one that's kind of stuck around.

672
00:29:11,180 --> 00:29:13,180
 That's very interesting.

673
00:29:13,180 --> 00:29:14,180
 Very interesting, yeah.

674
00:29:14,180 --> 00:29:20,060
 Do you guys know about Simon Hayha who I'm almost certain that's not how you pronounce his

675
00:29:20,060 --> 00:29:21,060
 name.

676
00:29:21,060 --> 00:29:24,420
 In fact, I'm going to come out and say it, that's not how you pronounce his name.

677
00:29:24,420 --> 00:29:25,860
 He was finished.

678
00:29:25,860 --> 00:29:30,260
 He has the most number of confirmed kills of any soldier in history.

679
00:29:30,260 --> 00:29:31,260
 Wow.

680
00:29:31,260 --> 00:29:38,980
 505 with his rifle alone and possibly 200 plus more and the Soviets were so worried about

681
00:29:38,980 --> 00:29:41,580
 him because he was like a sniper just taking people out.

682
00:29:41,580 --> 00:29:47,420
 They would send artillery strikes in order just to kill him because he killed probably

683
00:29:47,420 --> 00:29:51,380
 0.6% of all the Soviet fatalities in the Winter War were down to him.

684
00:29:51,380 --> 00:29:52,380
 Geez.

685
00:29:52,380 --> 00:29:53,380
 Oh my goodness.

686
00:29:53,380 --> 00:29:59,860
 And he had a full white camouflage suit so no one could ever see him and so they couldn't

687
00:29:59,860 --> 00:30:00,860
 see his breath.

688
00:30:00,860 --> 00:30:05,460
 He used to put snow in his mouth so that his breath would be cold so that they wouldn't

689
00:30:05,460 --> 00:30:06,460
 be able to see him that way.

690
00:30:06,460 --> 00:30:07,460
 That's amazing.

691
00:30:07,460 --> 00:30:10,620
 Why wasn't all Winter Army uniforms just white?

692
00:30:10,620 --> 00:30:11,620
 They were.

693
00:30:11,620 --> 00:30:15,380
 All the fins were all this fins and skis were in the white uniform.

694
00:30:15,380 --> 00:30:16,380
 They didn't eat snow.

695
00:30:16,380 --> 00:30:18,540
 No, but the Russians didn't.

696
00:30:18,540 --> 00:30:19,620
 They came in carcay.

697
00:30:19,620 --> 00:30:21,100
 So that was one another one of the problems.

698
00:30:21,100 --> 00:30:22,100
 Yeah, they were.

699
00:30:22,100 --> 00:30:23,100
 They got the wrong.

700
00:30:23,100 --> 00:30:24,100
 That's a bit of an oversight.

701
00:30:24,100 --> 00:30:28,940
 Big arrows above the same enemy here.

702
00:30:28,940 --> 00:30:35,300
 The lot of immigrants from America and Canada finishing immigrants to American Canada returned

703
00:30:35,300 --> 00:30:36,300
 home for the war.

704
00:30:36,300 --> 00:30:41,420
 They sort of came back to sort of help Finland out and they had a lot of volunteers as well

705
00:30:41,420 --> 00:30:42,420
 who did that.

706
00:30:42,420 --> 00:30:46,700
 One of which was the actor Christopher Lee who fought in the Winter War.

707
00:30:46,700 --> 00:30:47,700
 What?

708
00:30:47,700 --> 00:30:52,780
 Yeah, Sarah Man from the Hobbit movies Count Duku from the second Star Wars movie maker

709
00:30:52,780 --> 00:30:53,780
 from the man with a golden gun.

710
00:30:53,780 --> 00:30:54,780
 We know the filmography.

711
00:30:54,780 --> 00:30:56,980
 We didn't know he fought in the Winter War.

712
00:30:56,980 --> 00:30:57,980
 Yeah.

713
00:30:57,980 --> 00:30:58,980
 Doesn't say that on his IMDB.

714
00:30:58,980 --> 00:30:59,980
 Does it?

715
00:30:59,980 --> 00:31:00,980
 No, it's it's.

716
00:31:00,980 --> 00:31:01,980
 Yeah.

717
00:31:01,980 --> 00:31:05,660
 He was not on the front line but he was he went back for the effort and he was a volunteer

718
00:31:05,660 --> 00:31:06,660
 and he helps.

719
00:31:06,660 --> 00:31:08,860
 No, he was he was just going to start it.

720
00:31:08,860 --> 00:31:09,860
 He was.

721
00:31:09,860 --> 00:31:10,860
 Oh my gosh.

722
00:31:10,860 --> 00:31:11,860
 Oh my god.

723
00:31:11,860 --> 00:31:13,860
 You're better than that.

724
00:31:13,860 --> 00:31:18,260
 I'm not sure he is, James.

725
00:31:18,260 --> 00:31:19,260
 No, he was America.

726
00:31:19,260 --> 00:31:20,860
 He was just volunteering.

727
00:31:20,860 --> 00:31:25,500
 Dan, do you know there's a conspiracy theory that Finland doesn't exist?

728
00:31:25,500 --> 00:31:26,500
 No.

729
00:31:26,500 --> 00:31:27,500
 Oh my god.

730
00:31:27,500 --> 00:31:28,500
 What's the reason?

731
00:31:28,500 --> 00:31:29,500
 What's the reason?

732
00:31:29,500 --> 00:31:30,500
 The other one is the mix.

733
00:31:30,500 --> 00:31:31,500
 What's the reason?

734
00:31:31,500 --> 00:31:37,220
 The idea is that it was made up by the Soviet Union and Japan.

735
00:31:37,220 --> 00:31:40,780
 And the reason was that the fishing is so good around the Baltic Sea area.

736
00:31:40,780 --> 00:31:43,540
 They wanted other countries to think there's no point sending boats there because there's

737
00:31:43,540 --> 00:31:44,980
 a massive country in the way.

738
00:31:44,980 --> 00:31:45,980
 Oh wow.

739
00:31:45,980 --> 00:31:50,460
 And so the idea is that there is no such place as Finland and all the people who think

740
00:31:50,460 --> 00:31:56,740
 that they're Finnish are actually living in Estonia and other countries around there.

741
00:31:56,740 --> 00:32:00,900
 And according to the conspiracy theorists, the fact that it's called Finland is a clue

742
00:32:00,900 --> 00:32:03,180
 because fish have fiddens.

743
00:32:03,180 --> 00:32:04,580
 That's very good.

744
00:32:04,580 --> 00:32:05,580
 See?

745
00:32:05,580 --> 00:32:06,580
 Yeah.

746
00:32:06,580 --> 00:32:08,580
 Built on solid reasoning.

747
00:32:08,580 --> 00:32:17,860
 So who's buying all the saunas if it's not the thing?

748
00:32:17,860 --> 00:32:22,140
 Okay, it is time for our final fact of the show and that is my fact.

749
00:32:22,140 --> 00:32:28,620
 My fact this week is that Greek gods of the ocean include Poseidon, Triton, Oceanus

750
00:32:28,620 --> 00:32:36,420
 and Doris, Doris the God who just brought them all tea and biscuits in the afternoon.

751
00:32:36,420 --> 00:32:37,420
 Yeah.

752
00:32:37,420 --> 00:32:38,420
 So they're all oceanids.

753
00:32:38,420 --> 00:32:40,180
 Doris is an oceanid.

754
00:32:40,180 --> 00:32:42,500
 She, Doris is Poseidon's mother-in-law.

755
00:32:42,500 --> 00:32:47,060
 Do you want to, when you say an oceanid, as if that's just a word that we casually use

756
00:32:47,060 --> 00:32:48,060
 in day to day life?

757
00:32:48,060 --> 00:32:49,060
 Yeah.

758
00:32:49,060 --> 00:32:50,060
 I should explain what it is.

759
00:32:50,060 --> 00:32:53,540
 An oceanid is like a cryptid, cryptid being yetis and stuff.

760
00:32:53,540 --> 00:32:57,540
 An oceanid is a specific god of the ocean.

761
00:32:57,540 --> 00:32:58,540
 Is that right?

762
00:32:58,540 --> 00:33:01,820
 Oceanid, maybe, I don't know.

763
00:33:01,820 --> 00:33:02,820
 Oh yeah, maybe.

764
00:33:02,820 --> 00:33:03,820
 Oceanid.

765
00:33:03,820 --> 00:33:07,740
 All the ancient Greeks are dead, so no one is going to write this in great terms.

766
00:33:07,740 --> 00:33:09,460
 But yeah, I just love that as a...

767
00:33:09,460 --> 00:33:10,660
 Poseidon's mother-in-law.

768
00:33:10,660 --> 00:33:11,660
 Yeah.

769
00:33:11,660 --> 00:33:15,100
 So she's associated with a lot of very famous names that you would know if you know basic

770
00:33:15,100 --> 00:33:16,100
 Greek godology.

771
00:33:16,100 --> 00:33:20,260
 That I am certain is not a word.

772
00:33:20,260 --> 00:33:24,300
 I think we should just apologise now for all our pronunciations for everything for

773
00:33:24,300 --> 00:33:29,260
 the last four years, but especially for the next four years, yeah.

774
00:33:29,260 --> 00:33:35,100
 Doric is a Greek word, obviously mostly famous for Doric architecture, so everyone knows

775
00:33:35,100 --> 00:33:36,260
 that I spot a Doric column.

776
00:33:36,260 --> 00:33:37,260
 I feel like...

777
00:33:37,260 --> 00:33:38,260
 I feel like...

778
00:33:38,260 --> 00:33:39,260
 Oh yeah.

779
00:33:39,260 --> 00:33:42,740
 So there was an area called Doris, which is where the Doric architecture was from, which

780
00:33:42,740 --> 00:33:43,740
 I...

781
00:33:43,740 --> 00:33:44,740
 Yeah.

782
00:33:44,740 --> 00:33:47,020
 Can you tell us how to recognise a Doric column?

783
00:33:47,020 --> 00:33:48,020
 I don't know how to do that.

784
00:33:48,020 --> 00:33:49,020
 I always...

785
00:33:49,020 --> 00:33:50,260
 I'm going to get it wrong.

786
00:33:50,260 --> 00:33:55,700
 I always thought it was the ones, so they're wider at the bottom than at the top, which

787
00:33:55,700 --> 00:33:58,180
 often you don't notice that, because it's further away at the top anyway.

788
00:33:58,180 --> 00:33:59,180
 Got it.

789
00:33:59,180 --> 00:34:02,220
 And they've got those little grooves in them, so you know columns that have grooves.

790
00:34:02,220 --> 00:34:03,220
 Yeah.

791
00:34:03,220 --> 00:34:04,220
 So they're quite plain.

792
00:34:04,220 --> 00:34:06,980
 What's really funny is that you and I are discussing this, and I'm the actually known.

793
00:34:06,980 --> 00:34:08,500
 And I'm absolutely trying to get it.

794
00:34:08,500 --> 00:34:10,540
 I'm actually trying to get it.

795
00:34:10,540 --> 00:34:11,540
 No, I don't know.

796
00:34:11,540 --> 00:34:12,540
 We've got time.

797
00:34:12,540 --> 00:34:13,540
 Right, guys.

798
00:34:13,540 --> 00:34:14,540
 Okay.

799
00:34:14,540 --> 00:34:15,540
 Basically Doric is the absolute vanilla of columns.

800
00:34:15,540 --> 00:34:16,540
 It's also got the grooves.

801
00:34:16,540 --> 00:34:18,140
 It's got a couple of round bands at the top.

802
00:34:18,140 --> 00:34:19,140
 Nothing fancy.

803
00:34:19,140 --> 00:34:23,820
 Doric's ionic, which has got the curly scrolls, and then Corinthian are the crazy, crazy

804
00:34:23,820 --> 00:34:27,140
 ones, which have got flowers and bursting pineapples at the top.

805
00:34:27,140 --> 00:34:28,140
 Those are the really fancy ones.

806
00:34:28,140 --> 00:34:29,140
 Right?

807
00:34:29,140 --> 00:34:31,980
 Then you get some composite ones as well, but we don't have time for that.

808
00:34:31,980 --> 00:34:32,980
 No, please.

809
00:34:32,980 --> 00:34:34,580
 No, no, no.

810
00:34:34,580 --> 00:34:35,580
 No.

811
00:34:35,580 --> 00:34:40,460
 Doric felt like she was the god of the kind of rubbishy part of the ocean.

812
00:34:40,460 --> 00:34:45,500
 So she was specifically the god of the mouth of rivers where the freshwater mingles with

813
00:34:45,500 --> 00:34:48,820
 the brine, and it gets really briny and salty.

814
00:34:48,820 --> 00:34:52,660
 So she was really just that specific part that she managed, and she represented the fertility

815
00:34:52,660 --> 00:34:53,660
 of the sea.

816
00:34:53,660 --> 00:34:54,660
 That's quite a good bit, I think.

817
00:34:54,660 --> 00:34:55,660
 Yeah.

818
00:34:55,660 --> 00:34:56,660
 It was a fishing ground.

819
00:34:56,660 --> 00:34:59,540
 So if you were into fishing, it was like mungrobes and stuff like that, right?

820
00:34:59,540 --> 00:35:00,540
 Yeah.

821
00:35:00,540 --> 00:35:04,260
 It does feel a bit like she was at the back of the queue when the bits of the ocean were

822
00:35:04,260 --> 00:35:06,060
 being handed out to all the gods.

823
00:35:06,060 --> 00:35:09,420
 There was a god called Akkalaus, who was the patron god of the Akkalaus River, and that

824
00:35:09,420 --> 00:35:11,740
 was the largest river in ancient Greece, so that was quite important.

825
00:35:11,740 --> 00:35:15,300
 But I like the thing about him was that he created the river by crying.

826
00:35:15,300 --> 00:35:26,580
 He was the Justin Timberlake of his time, wasn't he?

827
00:35:26,580 --> 00:35:29,940
 There were still loads of things to date that are named after the gods.

828
00:35:29,940 --> 00:35:34,860
 So there was one article, you know quartz.com, who's a really good, there was an article all

829
00:35:34,860 --> 00:35:38,220
 about hedge funds which are named after the gods.

830
00:35:38,220 --> 00:35:42,660
 And it did mention an analysis, which found that if you add a word which conveys gravitas

831
00:35:42,660 --> 00:35:48,780
 to the name of your big financial body, likes use or aries or Poseidon or the Roman equivalents.

832
00:35:48,780 --> 00:35:49,780
 Oh, Doris.

833
00:35:49,780 --> 00:35:53,100
 Oh, I'm not sure about Doris, that is a thing.

834
00:35:53,100 --> 00:35:58,460
 If you add a gravitas word, it adds $250,000 of income each year.

835
00:35:58,460 --> 00:35:59,460
 Wow.

836
00:35:59,460 --> 00:36:05,100
 But it also pointed out that almost all of these names are really badly chosen.

837
00:36:05,100 --> 00:36:06,900
 So Hermes is chosen for loads of them.

838
00:36:06,900 --> 00:36:09,220
 He was the god of swindlers.

839
00:36:09,220 --> 00:36:13,940
 There's Medea who murdered her ex-boyfriend's sons, there's Icarus who famously flies

840
00:36:13,940 --> 00:36:17,260
 too high and then crashes into the ocean.

841
00:36:17,260 --> 00:36:20,420
 And then there's Tantlers who is good because he's wealthy.

842
00:36:20,420 --> 00:36:24,780
 But he also, when the gods visited him, he killed his own son and roasted him to impress

843
00:36:24,780 --> 00:36:25,780
 the gods.

844
00:36:25,780 --> 00:36:28,340
 So they punished him to eternal hunger and thirst.

845
00:36:28,340 --> 00:36:30,980
 But they all have the odd skeleton in their closet, don't they?

846
00:36:30,980 --> 00:36:31,980
 These gods.

847
00:36:31,980 --> 00:36:32,980
 That's true.

848
00:36:32,980 --> 00:36:33,980
 You know, they often do good stuff.

849
00:36:33,980 --> 00:36:36,260
 But then they, you know, eat their children or whatever.

850
00:36:36,260 --> 00:36:38,260
 But there's always something for all of you.

851
00:36:38,260 --> 00:36:44,900
 These are the weird things I do to impress someone who's roasted and eat your own son.

852
00:36:44,900 --> 00:36:50,860
 Just on names, I found that the eldest cyclops of Gaia was called Bronte.

853
00:36:50,860 --> 00:36:54,340
 And Bronte was for the thunder, god of the thunder.

854
00:36:54,340 --> 00:37:00,500
 So you've got the Brontosaurus or thunder lizard, which gets its name from the Bronte.

855
00:37:00,500 --> 00:37:01,500
 There's a theory.

856
00:37:01,500 --> 00:37:04,460
 Now I'm getting this from Stephen Fry's mythos book.

857
00:37:04,460 --> 00:37:07,740
 And so this is a footnote, which is a theory he's putting forward that someone has come

858
00:37:07,740 --> 00:37:15,180
 up with, the Bronte sisters are actually named after this Greek god, Bronte.

859
00:37:15,180 --> 00:37:21,100
 And it's because their father was born Bronte, B-R-U-N-T-Y, but changed it to Bronte, either

860
00:37:21,100 --> 00:37:26,620
 as a tribute to the classical Greek god or in honor of Admiral Nelson, who was made

861
00:37:26,620 --> 00:37:28,420
 the Duke of Bronte.

862
00:37:28,420 --> 00:37:31,300
 And that dukedom was located on the slopes of Etna.

863
00:37:31,300 --> 00:37:34,420
 And that was believed to have been derived from the cyclops named Bronte.

864
00:37:34,420 --> 00:37:38,820
 So the Bronte sisters are possibly a tribute name to a Greek god.

865
00:37:38,820 --> 00:37:40,140
 That's very cool.

866
00:37:40,140 --> 00:37:41,540
 That's pretty cool, eh?

867
00:37:41,540 --> 00:37:46,500
 Some more gods from that big list on Wikipedia of gods.

868
00:37:46,500 --> 00:37:49,780
 Chiamites is the demigod of the bean.

869
00:37:49,780 --> 00:37:54,820
 Wow, not even the god of the bean, out.

870
00:37:54,820 --> 00:38:01,420
 Accratopotes is the god of unmixed wine and incontinence.

871
00:38:01,420 --> 00:38:06,060
 And Harpocrates, I quite like him, he is the god of silence.

872
00:38:06,060 --> 00:38:12,660
 And a lot of people thought that Harpo Marx got his name because he was always silent.

873
00:38:12,660 --> 00:38:14,780
 But actually he got his name because he played the harp.

874
00:38:14,780 --> 00:38:15,780
 He played the harp.

875
00:38:15,780 --> 00:38:17,780
 It's just a coincidence.

876
00:38:17,780 --> 00:38:25,020
 There was a god called Anna Idea and the Anna Idea was a spirit of ruthlessness.

877
00:38:25,020 --> 00:38:26,020
 Yeah, yeah.

878
00:38:26,020 --> 00:38:27,020
 I can do that.

879
00:38:27,020 --> 00:38:29,700
 Shamelessness and unforgivingness.

880
00:38:29,700 --> 00:38:32,780
 Oh, that does sound a bit harsh.

881
00:38:32,780 --> 00:38:37,300
 Have you, you know, Kardea, who's the Roman goddess of door hinges?

882
00:38:37,300 --> 00:38:38,300
 Cool.

883
00:38:38,300 --> 00:38:39,780
 Quite a, quite a low-rung.

884
00:38:39,780 --> 00:38:40,780
 Well, no, it's interesting.

885
00:38:40,780 --> 00:38:43,300
 I wouldn't have known they had hinges back then.

886
00:38:43,300 --> 00:38:45,700
 I didn't think the doors opened because they had doors.

887
00:38:45,700 --> 00:38:46,700
 Okay.

888
00:38:46,700 --> 00:38:48,820
 Well done Greeks.

889
00:38:48,820 --> 00:38:50,300
 There was Roman.

890
00:38:50,300 --> 00:38:51,300
 I was Roman.

891
00:38:51,300 --> 00:38:52,300
 Sorry, Roman.

892
00:38:52,300 --> 00:38:53,300
 He was Roman, yeah.

893
00:38:53,300 --> 00:38:54,620
 I think also the Greeks might have had hinges on doors.

894
00:38:54,620 --> 00:38:55,620
 We don't know that.

895
00:38:55,620 --> 00:39:01,020
 It's so annoying because I can't prove to you that we do know that in the moment.

896
00:39:01,020 --> 00:39:02,020
 I think we do know that.

897
00:39:02,020 --> 00:39:04,740
 That must be annoying.

898
00:39:04,740 --> 00:39:06,820
 There are still people who worship the ancient Greek gods.

899
00:39:06,820 --> 00:39:07,820
 Not many.

900
00:39:07,820 --> 00:39:08,820
 No.

901
00:39:08,820 --> 00:39:09,820
 I'll say that.

902
00:39:09,820 --> 00:39:14,540
 But in Greece, in 2006, a court in Athens officially unbanned their worship, but only about

903
00:39:14,540 --> 00:39:15,940
 2000 worshipers.

904
00:39:15,940 --> 00:39:20,300
 And the story in the Guardian quoted a Christian priest in Greece who said, "They are a handful

905
00:39:20,300 --> 00:39:25,220
 of miserable resuscitators of a degenerate dead religion who wish to return to the monstrous

906
00:39:25,220 --> 00:39:27,660
 dark delusions of the past."

907
00:39:27,660 --> 00:39:30,460
 That's harsh for what is just a bunch of harmless excents, isn't it?

908
00:39:30,460 --> 00:39:31,460
 I think so.

909
00:39:31,460 --> 00:39:32,460
 Yeah.

910
00:39:32,460 --> 00:39:33,460
 Do you know the word atheists?

911
00:39:33,460 --> 00:39:37,940
 Where we get atheism comes from without God or God forsaken or abandoned by God?

912
00:39:37,940 --> 00:39:40,500
 That's what it originally meant.

913
00:39:40,500 --> 00:39:42,180
 And we got the word from the French.

914
00:39:42,180 --> 00:39:45,660
 And in English, it predates the word "theism" by over 100 years.

915
00:39:45,660 --> 00:39:49,020
 So atheism was the first thing, and then we got theism afterwards.

916
00:39:49,020 --> 00:39:50,020
 Oh, no.

917
00:39:50,020 --> 00:39:51,020
 That was interesting.

918
00:39:51,020 --> 00:39:52,020
 That is interesting.

919
00:39:52,020 --> 00:39:55,220
 It's absolutely opposite of what I thought would have been.

920
00:39:55,220 --> 00:39:59,060
 I think that's why, you know, I think that's why I mentioned it.

921
00:39:59,060 --> 00:40:02,820
 If all my facts were exactly what you felt they were going to be, then this would be a

922
00:40:02,820 --> 00:40:03,820
 very barry podcast.

923
00:40:03,820 --> 00:40:09,460
 Well, maybe you've finally said something I didn't know you said.

924
00:40:09,460 --> 00:40:14,060
 Okay, that is it.

925
00:40:14,060 --> 00:40:15,220
 That is all of our facts.

926
00:40:15,220 --> 00:40:17,060
