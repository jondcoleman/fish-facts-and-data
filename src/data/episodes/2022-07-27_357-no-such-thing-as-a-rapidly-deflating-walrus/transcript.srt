00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:19,600
 Hello and welcome to another episode of No Such Thing as a Fish, a weekly podcast coming to

3
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:25,200
 you from four undisclosed locations in the UK. My name is Dan Schreiber, I am sitting here with

4
00:00:25,200 --> 00:00:30,240
 Anna Tyshinski, James Harkin and Andrew Hunter Murray and once again we have gathered round our

5
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:35,040
 microphones with our four favourite facts from the last seven days and in no particular order,

6
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:43,280
 here we go. Starting with you, Anna. My fact this week is that in 2016 Tupperware claimed to be

7
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:53,600
 holding a party summer in the world every 1.3 seconds. Bullshit! No! How's that possible?

8
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:59,760
 You're just not being invited and I know this is awkward. This is Tupperware parties. The reason

9
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:03,680
 I'm researching this is because I was talking to my mum a couple of weeks ago and she said,

10
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:07,520
 "I wonder if anyone goes to Tupperware parties anymore?" And I said, "What on earth are you

11
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:12,400
 talking about?" And then she was saying about, you know, how in their youths you'd have Tupperware

12
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:19,360
 parties and they are a thing where a Tupperware salesperson, sales rep, basically throws a house

13
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:24,480
 party where they demonstrate and display all sorts of Tupperware and it's still really popular

14
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:29,920
 around the world. So they stopped happening in the UK in 2003, but they happen in lots of other

15
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:35,440
 countries still. Every 1.3 seconds you could be at one. They make extraordinary claims. So they

16
00:01:35,440 --> 00:01:39,440
 claim that France has half a million Tupperware parties every year, which how many people go to

17
00:01:39,440 --> 00:01:46,720
 a Tupperware party would you say? Is it 10? Yeah, 8 to 10. These days none. Like it must have been

18
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:52,560
 a bad year for Tupperware sales last year. Okay, so France has half a million Tupperware parties

19
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:57,280
 each with, let's say, 10 people attending. That's still 5 million French people. No, it isn't.

20
00:01:57,280 --> 00:02:00,880
 You're not saying that you only go to one Tupperware party every year and it's like, "Nope,

21
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:05,440
 that's my fill for the year." These Tupperware enthusiasts are going to more than one party.

22
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:10,080
 That's true. And also there are Tupperware raves, which can get really out of control quite a

23
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:16,160
 little. They're illegal at the moment, but... You have to bring your drugs in a totally sized Tupperware

24
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:21,920
 labelled. It is amazing the Tupperware story. So as you said, that's how they actually sell

25
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:27,120
 Tupperware and it started off not being very successful. So it was invented by Earl Tupper,

26
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:34,720
 not an Earl. That's just his name. I think it was 1946 and didn't sell very well. And then this

27
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:41,520
 woman called Brownie Wise came along with a wise attitude towards PR. And she was already selling

28
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:46,560
 various household goods via the house party. And she bought up some Tupperware, sold it,

29
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:52,400
 and he spotted that she was causing a massive increase in sales this way. And I think within

30
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:58,160
 three years of her being on the scene, he took all his products off shelves and sold them exclusively

31
00:02:58,160 --> 00:03:03,040
 at parties. And five years after she came on the scene, the company was making $100 million

32
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:10,000
 in sales per year. Wow. She absolutely smashed it. Yeah. She found out that whenever you put like

33
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:14,400
 some gravy in a Tupperware box and threw it across the room, she always got way more sales.

34
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:19,360
 That was the pièce de résistance, wasn't it? Bouncing the Tupperware across the room.

35
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:24,480
 The gravy frisbee. It's mad as well, isn't it, that this feels like, again, there's probably

36
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:28,320
 other research to suggest otherwise. But to me, it feels like this is the moment where we accepted

37
00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:32,720
 plastic into the house. So that's what they were fighting against, largely. Plastic wasn't a thing

38
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:37,760
 that you brought into the house. And a lot of people were very resistant to it. So it's so odd

39
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:42,320
 to know that in my head, at least, this is the moment where all of this now, all the plastic in

40
00:03:42,320 --> 00:03:45,760
 our house is off the back of these parties that were happening with Brownie Wise in America.

41
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:47,120
 Interesting idea. I like that.

42
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:49,920
 Diane lives in a child's Wendy house, we should say at this point.

43
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:53,440
 He's got his little cozy coupe car in the corner.

44
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:59,200
 Speaking of the actual Tupperware parties, have you heard of the parties they used to have at

45
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:05,680
 Tupperware HQ? No, that sounded wild. So these, again, were Brownie Wise's idea. It was called

46
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:10,240
 Homecoming Jubilee. And it was for hundreds of the Tupperware sales women who were, I think

47
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:15,200
 they were exclusively women who were selling the products in the home. So they had these, like,

48
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:18,800
 mad, orgiastic, not quite orgiastic, but they were pretty funky.

49
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:26,560
 And they were so far from orgiastic. No, no, no, no. What about this? 1954's big Tupperware rave

50
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:31,920
 was called a big dig. A big what? Sorry. A big dig. All right. So did it.

51
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:40,880
 She buried $50,000 worth of minx dolls, diamond rings, gold watches, and tiny model cars around

52
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:45,280
 the place at Tupperware HQ. And you had to go and dig them up. And if you found a tiny model car,

53
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:51,920
 you could swap it for an actual car. I mean, it sounds insane. And they had Methodist preachers

54
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:56,320
 come and say that Tupperware was a way of fighting communism. They had a Walk of Fame,

55
00:04:56,320 --> 00:05:02,400
 which was just Tupperware sales women on the Walk of Fame. They had a 40 foot mural called

56
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:06,480
 the Museum of Dishes. They had a pond where apparently she baptized people.

57
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:10,880
 Yeah, I haven't been exactly clear on why she was baptising people.

58
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:16,480
 They did. They did say, though, that Brownie Wise had a sort of religious aura to her, didn't she?

59
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:21,680
 She sort of was treated as a sort of high priest of the Tupperware religion at that time.

60
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:29,920
 And she used to go around with the original slag, polyethylene slag that Earl Tupper had used,

61
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:34,720
 and she would allow people to stroke it and touch the slag, the sacred slag.

62
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:38,240
 I said it was orgiastic. And if you're touching the sacred slag,

63
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:41,520
 Brian, you should say what slag is. Yeah.

64
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:49,600
 Well, it's polyethylene, isn't it? It's like a plastic, it's like a black plastic mold.

65
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:53,920
 It's the plastic which the Tupperware was eventually made out of.

66
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:59,440
 So he was given one of these big lumps of cast-off plastic from another company,

67
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:04,560
 and he used a process to turn it into this kind of see-through plastic container thing.

68
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:09,360
 And he kept the original version of it and then gave it to Brownie Wise, didn't he?

69
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:10,160
 So cool.

70
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:14,400
 And she said, just get your fingers on it, wish for what you want,

71
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:19,600
 know it's going to come true, and then get out and work like everything, and it will.

72
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:23,440
 It is starting to sound more and more orgiastic, some of this language.

73
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:24,240
 Sort of it.

74
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:26,560
 They had a wishing well at company headquarters.

75
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:28,640
 That's sort of what you were saying, James, about the wishes.

76
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:31,040
 They had a wishing well, and that's the point,

77
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:33,440
 you throw wishes into the wishing well, don't you, if there is a wishing well.

78
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:38,080
 And they got a wish fairy to come and dole out expensive gifts to the Tupperware ladies.

79
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:38,960
 Did she live in the well?

80
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:44,640
 It's unclear. I guess she lived in some Tupperware somewhere.

81
00:06:44,640 --> 00:06:46,480
 That would be cool.

82
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:49,040
 Do you know the thing of someone bursting out of a cake?

83
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:50,320
 Yeah.

84
00:06:50,320 --> 00:06:52,960
 They must have had someone bursting out of some Tupperware at one of these parties.

85
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:55,520
 I doubt it, because I think the whole point of Tupperware is that it doesn't

86
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:57,840
 open without quite a lot of force.

87
00:06:57,840 --> 00:07:02,240
 So you just basically got some asphyxiated woman in a plastic container.

88
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:05,600
 That's a good advert, though.

89
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:09,360
 I mean, it's so secure that if your life depends on it, you can't escape.

90
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:14,160
 One of the things they did just on that subject is they did something called carrot calling,

91
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:18,720
 which what would happen is you'd go to your party and then you'd get some Tupperware,

92
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:21,360
 and then you'd put some carrots in your Tupperware,

93
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:24,560
 and then you'd put some just on the shelf wherever you keep it or in the fridge,

94
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:26,480
 if you're a weirdo that keeps your carrots in the fridge.

95
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:30,640
 And then they would say, OK, well, let's come back in a month's time

96
00:07:30,640 --> 00:07:33,360
 and see how the carrots look that were in your Tupperware

97
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:36,720
 compared to the ones that are on your shelf or on your pantry, right?

98
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:40,400
 And so that was not only a way of proving how good the Tupperware was,

99
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:44,480
 but it was a way of making sure the same people came back to your party to buy more shit.

100
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:45,840
 So it was pretty clever.

101
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:47,920
 That's really clever.

102
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:53,360
 Just one thing about Tupperware that I found bizarre is that a third of its revenue comes

103
00:07:53,360 --> 00:08:00,160
 from makeup sales. Tupperware makeup. And in fact, in South America, it's more than half.

104
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:05,600
 In Uruguay, 70%. And I could go on.

105
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:07,120
 In parts of Uruguay, 90%.

106
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:13,520
 There's one house in Uruguay, which is 100% Tupperware makeup.

107
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:16,400
 What is the makeup? Is it a famous brand?

108
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:20,320
 So they bought up a bunch of beauty brands in the early 2000s.

109
00:08:20,320 --> 00:08:22,800
 And this is when the guy who was running the company at the time,

110
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:27,200
 I think it was a guy called Rick Goings, he realized that in South America,

111
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:31,680
 he ran some stats and realized that people spent much more on makeup than they did on food containers.

112
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:35,200
 He said that he checked something called the Vanity Index.

113
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:39,760
 And South American countries rate most highly in terms of people who care most about their appearance.

114
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:43,520
 And so they launched makeup there instead. And it's super popular.

115
00:08:43,520 --> 00:08:47,200
 I suppose like you would have Avon parties in the UK, wouldn't you?

116
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:49,360
 Like who would sell makeup and stuff like that.

117
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:54,000
 And Sommers parties, I think used to be a thing.

118
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:57,040
 Yeah, definitely a thing, wasn't they?

119
00:08:57,040 --> 00:09:01,920
 I think there was an article which claimed that there were 4,000 and Sommers parties every week.

120
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:02,960
 Every second.

121
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:10,560
 They had a falling out, didn't they, in the end, Earl and Brownie.

122
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:12,240
 The two combined geniuses.

123
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:15,520
 So Earl was sort of the inventive genius and she was the PR genius.

124
00:09:15,520 --> 00:09:19,760
 And he thought that it should be more about Tupperware and less about her.

125
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:21,280
 And it was becoming quite about her.

126
00:09:21,280 --> 00:09:24,240
 She was the first woman ever to appear on the cover of Business Week.

127
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:27,520
 She, because of her fame as this Tupperware Queen,

128
00:09:27,520 --> 00:09:30,480
 she ended up writing this self-help book called Best Wishes.

129
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:36,880
 And Earl Tupper eventually thought, no, she's becoming too self-involved and a hungry for fame.

130
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:41,440
 And he fired her in 1958 and sold the company shortly afterwards.

131
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:44,480
 I read, and I don't know, I think there's a lot of speculation

132
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:46,880
 because we don't fully know the details of the falling out.

133
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:50,480
 But there were a few rumours that he thought that once he passed away,

134
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:54,480
 if the business went to Brownie, it would go down because no one would want

135
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:58,080
 a woman at the head of a company, which sounds mad,

136
00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:00,800
 but apparently part of his thinking.

137
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:02,240
 I mean, there's a lot of rumours.

138
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:03,200
 It's very strange.

139
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:11,840
 I read one that in 1957, she had held a massive Tupperware party on a Florida island for 1,200 people.

140
00:10:11,840 --> 00:10:16,480
 And there was a torrential thunderstorm which injured 21 people and that led to lots of lawsuits.

141
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:22,320
 And so this is the most charitable explanation of why she was fired is that that was a big mistake.

142
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:26,080
 But it does seem like it was quite a lot to do with Tupper's ego.

143
00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:31,680
 And in fact, there's more evidence because she used to bury things on Tupperware HQ property.

144
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:38,400
 Once she had been sacked, he had a whole dug on Tupperware company property

145
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:43,520
 and dumped 600 copies of her book into the hole and buried them.

146
00:10:43,520 --> 00:10:44,560
 Wow.

147
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:47,760
 That wasn't so he could throw a big party where people got to dig on her book.

148
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:50,640
 It was not.

149
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:53,120
 Did he put it in Tupperware or is it just into the ground?

150
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:56,240
 I think the point was not to preserve the copies of the book for future generations.

151
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:59,760
 I was just thinking he would have shot himself in the foot there with that idea.

152
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:01,600
 He did go a bit strange afterwards, didn't he?

153
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:04,000
 He, what did he do?

154
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,400
 He moved to Costa Rica.

155
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:08,720
 He basically sold the company, got a whole load of money.

156
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:10,000
 He didn't want it to get taxed.

157
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:15,760
 And so divorced his wife and went to live in Costa Rica and so he did.

158
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:19,760
 Although before that he bought an island, which I think he wanted to live on.

159
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:22,640
 He bought this island called San Jose Island, which I'd never heard of.

160
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:24,400
 It's just off the coast of Panama.

161
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:27,760
 And he wanted it to become a holiday resort.

162
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:29,520
 And that makes him sound very Richard Branson,

163
00:11:29,520 --> 00:11:32,720
 but I think it was an island that didn't really have people on it

164
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:34,720
 and probably didn't cost a huge amount.

165
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:36,720
 And so he wanted it to be this glorious resort.

166
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:37,520
 And it looks stunning.

167
00:11:37,520 --> 00:11:40,080
 And I've seen pictures, golden sand beaches.

168
00:11:40,080 --> 00:11:44,800
 He hadn't investigated it enough because it had been the site of massive chemical weapons testing

169
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:48,240
 and dumps by the US, Canada and Britain in the 1940s.

170
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:50,800
 So he sent a couple of staff there.

171
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:53,440
 They got quite badly burned and damaged from that.

172
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:55,440
 And they realized that it was uninhabitable.

173
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:56,560
 That's bad luck.

174
00:11:56,560 --> 00:11:59,680
 He was an amazing ideas man from what I can tell.

175
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:04,080
 There's a lot of inventions that he tried to make that never ended up being

176
00:12:04,080 --> 00:12:06,240
 realized, which I think is a bit of a shame.

177
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:11,920
 He had the no drip ice cream cone, which that's a great idea, isn't it?

178
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:13,040
 It's a great idea.

179
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:13,360
 Yeah.

180
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:16,160
 It's one of the only problem with ice cream cones, really.

181
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:16,560
 Yeah.

182
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:18,320
 Actually, you know what I would invent?

183
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:21,360
 You know, the best thing about an ice cream cone is where you snap off the bottom

184
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:24,800
 of the ice cream cone and you turn it into a tiny little ice cream,

185
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:27,040
 tiny kind of microcosm of itself.

186
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:28,560
 Do you know that?

187
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:31,040
 So you snap off the bottom of an ice cream cone.

188
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:33,200
 So you have a tiny little bit of cone.

189
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:36,000
 And then you take a tiny little bit of ice cream from the top of it.

190
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:39,760
 And it can be like you're a giant because you have a tiny ice cream.

191
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:43,280
 Well, you could resell it to other kids around you and make back your money.

192
00:12:43,280 --> 00:12:47,280
 But then I would invent one where they kept re-growing the bottom

193
00:12:47,280 --> 00:12:49,040
 so you could do that an infinite amount of time.

194
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:51,120
 That's weird because I do.

195
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:52,800
 So do you not do the thing where you snap off the bottom

196
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:54,400
 and then you suck the ice cream out through the tube?

197
00:12:54,400 --> 00:12:55,120
 That's what I do.

198
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:58,240
 Ah, well, you could do both of those things if you, you know.

199
00:12:58,240 --> 00:12:59,040
 Yeah.

200
00:12:59,040 --> 00:12:59,520
 Yeah.

201
00:12:59,520 --> 00:13:00,960
 You're all mad in different ways.

202
00:13:00,960 --> 00:13:03,200
 These are not acceptable ways to get.

203
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:06,640
 As he stands next to the ice cream van and tells the children

204
00:13:06,640 --> 00:13:08,560
 what they're allowed to do and what they're not allowed to do.

205
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:12,960
 I've got my tray in front of me to catch any spare drops.

206
00:13:12,960 --> 00:13:16,800
 You thought the ice cream van man was scary.

207
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:20,080
 How about the creepy guy standing next to me catching our droplets?

208
00:13:20,080 --> 00:13:26,320
 A couple of other inventions by Earl Tupper.

209
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:30,880
 Fishing poles that wade your catch as you were reeling it in.

210
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:31,840
 Great idea.

211
00:13:31,840 --> 00:13:35,120
 He invented a machine to make it easier to clean and dress chickens.

212
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:37,200
 And dress.

213
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:41,280
 I imagine dress as in for cooking, not as in putting trousers on them or something.

214
00:13:41,280 --> 00:13:44,320
 Andy, did you read this one?

215
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:46,160
 Because I can't, I can't work out what it would be.

216
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:47,440
 A fish powered boat.

217
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:49,120
 I didn't read that.

218
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:52,080
 That was one where the idea is you get a really big fish

219
00:13:52,080 --> 00:13:55,040
 and you attach it to the bottom of your boat.

220
00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:59,600
 And then the fish swims along the river and just pulls your boat along with it.

221
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:01,920
 The boat is directly above the fish.

222
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:02,560
 Yeah, yeah.

223
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:03,600
 Is that real?

224
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:04,800
 Well, just one fish.

225
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:06,000
 None of these are really real.

226
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:06,640
 A lot of them.

227
00:14:06,640 --> 00:14:08,480
 I wonder if the concept was real, right?

228
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:08,880
 Sure.

229
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:13,440
 I mean, they were written in like his notebooks from when he was a teenager.

230
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:14,000
 Some of these.

231
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:17,760
 So I think they were, oh, I mean, they were ideas.

232
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:21,200
 But I don't think he ever really thought that we were going to take a load of boats

233
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:22,800
 and attach fish to the bottom of them.

234
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:27,760
 This, that could be the green energy solution that we're all looking for.

235
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:28,240
 It could be.

236
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:29,280
 That's what we want to do.

237
00:14:29,280 --> 00:14:31,440
 Like stress the fish out a bit more.

238
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:31,600
 Yeah.

239
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:35,520
 It makes sense, though, the invention of a fish weighing rod,

240
00:14:35,520 --> 00:14:37,680
 because you need to make sure you're really in a big fish

241
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:40,080
 if it's planning to drag your ferry over the tunnel.

242
00:14:40,080 --> 00:14:50,480
 OK, it is time for fact number two, and that is Andy.

243
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:55,360
 My fact is that in 1868, there were five different plays on in London's West End

244
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:59,760
 simultaneously where a train burst onto the stage and threatened to run somebody over.

245
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:04,800
 This was an huge theatrical trend.

246
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:05,840
 So I've got the names of the plays.

247
00:15:05,840 --> 00:15:08,320
 They were called Land Rats and Water Rats.

248
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:08,960
 That's one play.

249
00:15:08,960 --> 00:15:15,360
 Rail, River and Road, Danger, After Dark, and my favorite, The Scamps of London.

250
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:16,640
 Great sounding play.

251
00:15:16,640 --> 00:15:22,560
 And in all of these plays, there was a train drama scene where a train burst on.

252
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:27,680
 And the trains were obviously, you know, quite detailed wooden flats that were mounted on rails.

253
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:30,720
 So they did they were able to burst onto the stage.

254
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:34,640
 Lots of kind of sound effects and smoke and stuff.

255
00:15:34,640 --> 00:15:36,480
 Yeah, exactly.

256
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:38,800
 And this was a massive thing.

257
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:41,840
 And I think it was because of a play the previous year called Under the Gaslight.

258
00:15:41,840 --> 00:15:46,160
 Although it was in that was the first time it was really big on stage.

259
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:48,160
 The guy who wrote it, he was called Augustine Daly.

260
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:50,400
 And he claimed that other people had nicked his idea.

261
00:15:50,400 --> 00:15:52,800
 And then other people said, no, you nicked this from somewhere.

262
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:56,160
 Well, he was he won the court case.

263
00:15:56,160 --> 00:16:00,000
 So I think technically we have to say that it was his idea.

264
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,760
 He's not going to say.

265
00:16:01,760 --> 00:16:08,400
 He claimed that he was just walking down the road and he tripped up over like a piece of,

266
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:09,920
 you know, pavements or something.

267
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:12,480
 And he hurt his toe and had to hop all the way home.

268
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:17,120
 And when he landed back in his bed, it just appeared to him the idea from nowhere.

269
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:20,320
 As opposed to the fact that there was actually already an idea out there.

270
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:21,920
 Yeah, the weirdest.

271
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:26,000
 We actually have his first hand quotes from that moment.

272
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,680
 And it breeds so bizarre.

273
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:31,440
 He says, I was near my door and I rushed into the house, threw myself into a chair,

274
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:34,320
 grasping my injured foot with both hands for the pain was great.

275
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:36,800
 And exclaiming over and over again, I've got it.

276
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:37,520
 I've got it.

277
00:16:37,520 --> 00:16:39,680
 And it beats hot irons all to pieces.

278
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:42,480
 It's like, we should say this.

279
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:45,280
 Sorry, the idea that we're talking about is not the train crashing through though.

280
00:16:45,280 --> 00:16:47,040
 It's the person tied to a railway.

281
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:47,440
 I did.

282
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:51,600
 So this was a meme in 1867,

283
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:56,000
 which began with this under the gaslight play where someone's tied to a train track

284
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,480
 and a train's coming towards them at the very last minute.

285
00:16:58,480 --> 00:16:59,600
 You whip them away.

286
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:01,600
 And that was his genius idea, right?

287
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:04,320
 By the way, the stubbing his toe had nothing to do with it.

288
00:17:04,320 --> 00:17:05,040
 It's bizarre.

289
00:17:05,040 --> 00:17:07,200
 He just happened to stub his toe at the same time.

290
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:08,320
 The idea.

291
00:17:08,320 --> 00:17:13,920
 But this play was held at the Worrell Sisters New York City Theatre in 1867

292
00:17:13,920 --> 00:17:15,760
 and was absolutely massive.

293
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:20,480
 And it wasn't actually these days, I would say we would see that meme.

294
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:25,040
 And it would be like a damsel in distress who was tied to the rail tracks.

295
00:17:25,040 --> 00:17:29,680
 And then some mustachioed hero would come and save the day.

296
00:17:29,680 --> 00:17:33,120
 But in this case, it was actually the woman who saved the man.

297
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:35,840
 There was a man in the play called Snorky.

298
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:39,440
 And he was tied to the train tracks.

299
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:43,360
 And then the woman protagonist would come and save the day.

300
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:45,200
 And then Snorky would exclaim,

301
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:47,840
 "These are the women who ain't to have a vote."

302
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:49,600
 Oh, really?

303
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:50,320
 Political.

304
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:52,480
 So it's quite a political little thing.

305
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:56,240
 But the play was run by these sisters called the Worrell Sisters.

306
00:17:56,240 --> 00:17:58,240
 And they were massive.

307
00:17:58,240 --> 00:18:02,800
 They were the daughters of a clown and kind of grew up in the showbiz.

308
00:18:02,800 --> 00:18:06,960
 And they kind of started doing these burlesque acts

309
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:09,920
 where they would take the piss out of other plays and stuff like that.

310
00:18:09,920 --> 00:18:14,400
 And then eventually they did so well that they managed to buy their own theatre in New York City.

311
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:16,080
 And that was where they put on this play.

312
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:19,280
 And the most famous one of them was Jenny Worrell.

313
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:21,360
 And it was written of her that,

314
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:23,920
 "The beautiful voluptuous Jenny Worrell,

315
00:18:23,920 --> 00:18:28,880
 subtlete, drank champagne, owned fast horses, wore diamonds,

316
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:33,040
 squandered money to left and right until the public grew weary of her."

317
00:18:33,040 --> 00:18:36,080
 So and then she died in poverty in the end.

318
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:37,360
 So it's not a fun story.

319
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:39,600
 But unfortunately, she was also the daughter of a clown.

320
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:44,080
 So she had size 64 shoes and that made it very hard to socialise.

321
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:45,760
 I do think when Snorky says,

322
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:47,520
 "And these are the women to wait to have a vote,"

323
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:51,520
 it's slightly, like, did he believe in sufferage for women

324
00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:54,080
 before a woman saved him from a railway track?

325
00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:56,720
 Sometimes you need that moment of clarity,

326
00:18:56,720 --> 00:18:59,520
 like stubbing Yotto or being saved from a train.

327
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:02,560
 I think no one should have the vote

328
00:19:02,560 --> 00:19:04,800
 unless they can prove that they've saved someone else's life.

329
00:19:04,800 --> 00:19:10,160
 It's quite similar to just in the case of it switching,

330
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:12,240
 and it used to be a woman who saved a man,

331
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:15,280
 the first known cliffhanger, literal cliffhanger,

332
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:18,720
 was in Thomas Hardy's A Pair of Blue Eyes, wasn't it, in 1873.

333
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:21,120
 And so this was really the age of the cliffhanger.

334
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:23,040
 That's what that train scene is,

335
00:19:23,040 --> 00:19:25,360
 is because it's the very last minute when they escape.

336
00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:27,680
 Was this a novel, Anna, or did he write plays as well?

337
00:19:27,680 --> 00:19:29,840
 Yes, no, this was a novel, A Pair of Blue Eyes.

338
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:31,920
 And it features Henry Knight, who's the hero,

339
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:33,760
 and he's left dangling off the edge of a cliff.

340
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:36,320
 And then the whole book is him dangling,

341
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:39,280
 at which point he reviews the entire history of the world

342
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:40,640
 whilst waiting to be rescued.

343
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:42,720
 And that's the book.

344
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:46,480
 And then at the end, I believe his love interest pops up,

345
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:48,720
 and fashions are rope out of her own underwear

346
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:50,080
 to haul him to safety.

347
00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:53,280
 Wow, luckily she just came back from a land summits party.

348
00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:57,920
 Yes, it was very flimsy, it snapped immediately,

349
00:19:57,920 --> 00:19:59,280
 and he died tragically.

350
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:00,800
 I can't believe after all the crap we got

351
00:20:00,800 --> 00:20:03,840
 for ruining the ending of another classic literature novel

352
00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:07,040
 that you've gone ahead and spoiled the ending of this Hardy one.

353
00:20:07,040 --> 00:20:10,800
 Yeah, what was that, Anna Karenina?

354
00:20:10,800 --> 00:20:15,040
 Yeah, another book featuring, weirdly, a train which runs the road.

355
00:20:15,040 --> 00:20:16,400
 Oh, God, no, please.

356
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:17,680
 I need to hear that episode.

357
00:20:17,680 --> 00:20:18,400
 Stop listening.

358
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:23,520
 This sort of trend was Victorian melodrama, it gets called.

359
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:25,360
 And it was a really big thing.

360
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:28,880
 The idea was basically sensation.

361
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:32,800
 You had huge theatres, often with three or 4,000 seats in them.

362
00:20:32,800 --> 00:20:35,280
 And so theatres were engaged in an arms race

363
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:37,440
 to come up with the most sensational stuff.

364
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:40,320
 And a lot of them were thanks to a guy called Bruce Sensation

365
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:42,160
 Smith, have you heard of him?

366
00:20:42,160 --> 00:20:45,440
 He came up with loads of amazing theatrical gimmicks.

367
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:48,880
 So one of them is of a diver descending into the sea.

368
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:52,080
 So that's what's happening in the story.

369
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:57,760
 But to show that, the boat he's in, that got lifted up into the flies.

370
00:20:57,760 --> 00:20:59,440
 So it looks like he's descending

371
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:01,360
 because the boat is rising and rising above him.

372
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:05,680
 But also then they revealed huge tanks of water behind him

373
00:21:05,680 --> 00:21:07,200
 which have real fish swimming in them.

374
00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:11,200
 So as he descends, you see he is surrounded by actual fish.

375
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:12,320
 That's so cool.

376
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:13,280
 That's very cool.

377
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:16,160
 Not everyone was that happy with these sensational plays.

378
00:21:16,160 --> 00:21:20,160
 So W.S. Gilbert of Gilbert and Sullivan fame.

379
00:21:20,160 --> 00:21:22,400
 He said about these sensational plays,

380
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:25,840
 "Every play which contains a house on fire, a sinking steamer,

381
00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:30,160
 or a railway accident will succeed in spite of itself.

382
00:21:30,160 --> 00:21:33,280
 In point of fact, nothing could wreck such a piece

383
00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:35,360
 except carefully written dialogue

384
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:37,600
 or a strict attention to probability."

385
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:41,760
 He said, "Avoid these two stumbling blocks

386
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:43,760
 and your piece will succeed triumphantly."

387
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:45,120
 Meow.

388
00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:45,600
 I know.

389
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:47,040
 Ouch.

390
00:21:47,040 --> 00:21:48,480
 I think Dickens felt the same.

391
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:53,120
 Again, I think people would go to see the melodramatic moment

392
00:21:53,120 --> 00:21:56,000
 rather than any plot or dialogue or acting, wouldn't they?

393
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,480
 And Dickens said of a play called "The Streets of London"

394
00:21:58,480 --> 00:22:00,160
 which had a city burning down in it.

395
00:22:00,160 --> 00:22:02,320
 And the name would change depending on what city it was in.

396
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:03,600
 So it would be "The Streets of Bolton"

397
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:04,640
 when it went to Bolton.

398
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:06,400
 "The Streets of Glasgow."

399
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:07,760
 And Dickens said of it,

400
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:10,640
 "It's the most depressing instance without exception

401
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:13,840
 of an utterly degrading and debasing theatrical taste

402
00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:16,400
 that has ever come under my writhing notice."

403
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:17,600
 Wow.

404
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:18,800
 Well, that's extraordinary.

405
00:22:18,800 --> 00:22:21,520
 I guess it's just the equivalent of a blockbuster film though,

406
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:24,640
 which you guys, you know, that there's an incredible scene

407
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:26,480
 where a plane disassembles itself or whatever.

408
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:29,360
 Yeah, it's a Dwayne Johnson movie, basically.

409
00:22:29,360 --> 00:22:31,520
 Yeah, it's a Michael Bay movie.

410
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:32,480
 Yeah, I would have loved them.

411
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:35,040
 Imagine what Dickens would have thought of "Transformers Fall."

412
00:22:35,040 --> 00:22:39,360
 There was like a response to it, wasn't there?

413
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:41,440
 So in the 1850s and 1860s,

414
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:43,360
 there's a guy called Tom Robertson

415
00:22:43,360 --> 00:22:46,080
 who invented a thing called "Cup and Source of Realism."

416
00:22:46,080 --> 00:22:49,280
 And what that was, it was the exact opposite

417
00:22:49,280 --> 00:22:52,160
 of these train crashes and fires and drownings

418
00:22:52,160 --> 00:22:52,960
 and stuff like that.

419
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:57,360
 And this was reported as being really, really unusual.

420
00:22:57,360 --> 00:23:00,080
 If there were a few people talking in a kitchen, say,

421
00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:02,720
 Robertson would put on stage as many chairs

422
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:06,000
 as would realistically be found in a kitchen or a dining room,

423
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:08,400
 as opposed to everyone else who would say,

424
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:11,280
 "Well, there are two people talking, so we only need two chairs."

425
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:12,080
 So we'll just put that.

426
00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:14,560
 So he had everything that was really realistic.

427
00:23:14,560 --> 00:23:18,320
 And there was one where someone was making a pudding on stage.

428
00:23:18,320 --> 00:23:20,400
 And this was absolutely the talk of the town

429
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:23,120
 because it was so unusual that someone would really be

430
00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:26,240
 actually making a pudding while they were doing the talking.

431
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:30,080
 And instead of kind of projecting and really shouting

432
00:23:30,080 --> 00:23:32,640
 these kind of what was happening in the play,

433
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:34,320
 they would just talk as a normal person.

434
00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:36,240
 And it was just like a realistic thing.

435
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:38,160
 And to start off with, no one would put these plays on

436
00:23:38,160 --> 00:23:40,960
 because they were like, "Well, where's the fucking car crash?

437
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:43,040
 Where's the train crash? We don't have it."

438
00:23:43,040 --> 00:23:46,080
 But eventually there was one or two theaters that did it.

439
00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:48,880
 And then that's kind of where we are today a little bit, isn't it?

440
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:50,480
 Sort of, except the chair thing.

441
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:53,120
 I think the chair thing is still doesn't happen.

442
00:23:53,120 --> 00:23:55,120
 And that is revolutionary.

443
00:23:55,120 --> 00:23:58,640
 You do not see spare chairs in plays and that's bullshit.

444
00:23:58,640 --> 00:23:59,680
 You're right.

445
00:23:59,680 --> 00:24:03,680
 I was reading up on sort of general theater stage props

446
00:24:03,680 --> 00:24:05,760
 off the back of this fact.

447
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:07,760
 And so just a couple of things that I found.

448
00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:12,320
 There was a story of Orson Welles when he used to be performing

449
00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:13,760
 in Julius Caesar.

450
00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:16,960
 He played the role of Brutus.

451
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:22,320
 And he preferred a real knife because a plastic knife

452
00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:25,520
 didn't really give the proper shine in the theater lights.

453
00:24:25,520 --> 00:24:28,320
 So when you have a real blade, it really bounces it off

454
00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:29,200
 and makes it look real.

455
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:32,400
 Anyway, they had to take Julius Caesar to the hospital

456
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:34,160
 because he was stabbed by Orson Welles.

457
00:24:34,160 --> 00:24:37,520
 He collapsed.

458
00:24:37,520 --> 00:24:38,160
 Yeah.

459
00:24:38,160 --> 00:24:41,040
 And yeah, the end of the scene he was taken to the hospital

460
00:24:41,040 --> 00:24:43,520
 where he had to recover for quite a long time.

461
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:44,640
 At the end of the scene.

462
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:48,320
 I would say bring the scene to a close a little bit early.

463
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:50,880
 I think everyone's watching going,

464
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:53,120
 bloody hell Julius Caesar is good in this, isn't he?

465
00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:57,200
 Wow.

466
00:24:57,200 --> 00:24:57,280
 Yeah.

467
00:24:57,280 --> 00:24:59,680
 But doesn't he get stabbed about 40 times in the...

468
00:24:59,680 --> 00:25:00,400
 Because it loads of people.

469
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:01,760
 By lots of different people, though.

470
00:25:01,760 --> 00:25:04,400
 Presumably Orson Welles was the only one with a natural knife.

471
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:07,200
 Everyone else was just doing the plastic thing.

472
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:10,160
 Orson Welles was so devoted to his craft he handed out 40 knives

473
00:25:10,160 --> 00:25:12,720
 and he recruited his worst enemy to play Caesar.

474
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:15,680
 Wow.

475
00:25:15,680 --> 00:25:18,400
 Speaking of that, there was a production of Dad's Army

476
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:20,240
 in 2010 in South Wales.

477
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:22,720
 Local production.

478
00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:24,880
 And they realised in a rehearsal that they were

479
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:27,120
 accidentally using live grenades.

480
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:29,440
 Which they have just found.

481
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:30,080
 Don't panic.

482
00:25:30,080 --> 00:25:34,640
 And it was Corporal Jones who was the man who realised.

483
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:35,280
 Oh my God.

484
00:25:35,280 --> 00:25:35,920
 Yeah, I know.

485
00:25:35,920 --> 00:25:36,080
 Absolutely.

486
00:25:36,080 --> 00:25:38,400
 And they realised as he was looking at it he thought,

487
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:40,320
 "Oh, that's funny. This does look good, doesn't it?"

488
00:25:40,320 --> 00:25:42,080
 In fact, there's a pin still in it.

489
00:25:42,080 --> 00:25:47,520
 And they had found them in the garage of a cast member's father-in-law

490
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:49,680
 and just driven them to the theatre rattling around.

491
00:25:49,680 --> 00:25:51,840
 And they had to call the bomb squad to come and blow them up.

492
00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:52,480
 Oh, wow.

493
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:54,960
 You know what they do for drugs in films?

494
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:58,080
 Because in some films they have to take lots of drugs.

495
00:25:58,080 --> 00:26:01,760
 Is it like a flour or icing sugar or something?

496
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:02,240
 I would have thought.

497
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:03,040
 Yeah, it's pretty close.

498
00:26:03,040 --> 00:26:05,040
 So Propmasters, basically the ones,

499
00:26:05,040 --> 00:26:07,120
 they have to test all the drugs themselves

500
00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:08,880
 to make sure that you can take it as an actor

501
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:10,640
 and not immediately start choking or whatever.

502
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:14,720
 So fake cocaine in the Wolf of Wall Street,

503
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:17,120
 that I think was vitamin B powder.

504
00:26:17,120 --> 00:26:17,920
 And that was fine.

505
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:22,640
 They use moss instead of marijuana in films, which...

506
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:24,320
 Andy.

507
00:26:24,320 --> 00:26:26,560
 I imagine Andy going to his moss dealer

508
00:26:26,560 --> 00:26:28,480
 and accidentally getting some marijuana and going,

509
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:29,520
 "What's this bullshit?"

510
00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:33,520
 I felt calmer and I wanted to feel tense.

511
00:26:33,520 --> 00:26:36,800
 Yeah, magic mushrooms are just mushrooms.

512
00:26:36,800 --> 00:26:39,440
 They just use some mushrooms, but non-magic mushrooms.

513
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:40,400
 That makes sense.

514
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:40,800
 It does.

515
00:26:40,800 --> 00:26:44,560
 One more thing about the sensational plays.

516
00:26:44,560 --> 00:26:48,400
 So there was rules about what you could show in the theatre

517
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:49,600
 and then they got slightly loosened,

518
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:50,960
 but you still had to pass things

519
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:52,720
 through the law chamber in this office.

520
00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:54,320
 And so in the 19th century,

521
00:26:54,320 --> 00:26:57,760
 in order to get things through the censors,

522
00:26:57,760 --> 00:27:00,320
 you wouldn't put swear words in, for instance.

523
00:27:00,320 --> 00:27:02,400
 You would have other things that people would say.

524
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:05,360
 And so you have loads of awesome insults,

525
00:27:05,360 --> 00:27:09,040
 like people would call each other a rascally night hawk

526
00:27:09,040 --> 00:27:12,560
 or a herring-gutted villain and stuff like that.

527
00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:18,560
 Also, sometimes, like a villain, instead of going,

528
00:27:18,560 --> 00:27:23,040
 "Fuck you, you bastard, you stopped my amazing plan,"

529
00:27:23,040 --> 00:27:24,480
 they wouldn't be able to do any of that dialogue.

530
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:25,680
 You should write the scripts, actually,

531
00:27:25,680 --> 00:27:27,520
 if that's what the script is.

532
00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:28,720
 That was stunning.

533
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:31,840
 Well, I would do if it could go back into the 19th century,

534
00:27:31,840 --> 00:27:34,240
 because instead of using that amazing dialogue,

535
00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:37,840
 you would just shout out whatever your psychological state was.

536
00:27:37,840 --> 00:27:40,880
 It was an American play, which was adapted for the British stage.

537
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:43,840
 And when the villain had his plans filed,

538
00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:46,000
 he just shouted out, "Confusion!"

539
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:53,040
 Dan, I think we have a new catchphrase for you on the podcast.

540
00:27:53,040 --> 00:28:05,920
 Okay, it is time for fact number three, and that is James.

541
00:28:05,920 --> 00:28:09,520
 Okay, my fact this week is that when it wants to sleep,

542
00:28:09,520 --> 00:28:14,160
 a walrus will sometimes hook its tusks onto a small iceberg

543
00:28:14,160 --> 00:28:16,800
 and sleep while floating along in the water.

544
00:28:16,800 --> 00:28:19,600
 Isn't that cute?

545
00:28:19,600 --> 00:28:22,640
 It's so cute, apart from the quite big, fat,

546
00:28:22,640 --> 00:28:27,200
 blubbery things and probably quite cold, and it's a cute idea.

547
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:27,760
 It's still cute.

548
00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:28,800
 It's there, so cute.

549
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:30,320
 I think that's very cute.

550
00:28:30,320 --> 00:28:31,040
 Yeah.

551
00:28:31,040 --> 00:28:33,280
 So a few places on the internet doubt this,

552
00:28:33,280 --> 00:28:36,640
 but I am pretty confident that it does sometimes happen, at least.

553
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:43,360
 There was a book by Francis H. Fay called Ecology and Biology of the Pacific Walrus,

554
00:28:43,360 --> 00:28:45,280
 where they write that, "On numerous occasions,

555
00:28:45,280 --> 00:28:48,160
 I have seen walruses resting or sleeping in the water,

556
00:28:48,160 --> 00:28:50,640
 with their tusks hooked over the edge of the ice,

557
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:53,680
 their body laying either horizontally or vertically in the water.

558
00:28:53,680 --> 00:28:56,480
 The tusks appear to function both as a prop for the head,

559
00:28:56,480 --> 00:28:58,480
 keeping the mouth and nostrils out of the water,

560
00:28:58,480 --> 00:29:02,160
 and as an anchor, preventing the animal from drifting away with the current."

561
00:29:02,160 --> 00:29:05,040
 So it does seem like it does occasionally happen.

562
00:29:05,040 --> 00:29:08,720
 It's not the only way they sleep, but from time to time, they will do this.

563
00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:10,080
 It's so sweet.

564
00:29:10,080 --> 00:29:12,400
 They're very promiscuous sleepers, aren't they?

565
00:29:12,400 --> 00:29:13,760
 What do you mean they have sex?

566
00:29:13,760 --> 00:29:15,360
 No, I don't at all.

567
00:29:15,360 --> 00:29:17,040
 I just mean they'll sleep anywhere.

568
00:29:17,040 --> 00:29:18,480
 They'll sleep around.

569
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:21,120
 Yeah, literally around, as in different locations.

570
00:29:21,120 --> 00:29:26,800
 Imagine if that was another meaning of that, the misunderstandings you would have.

571
00:29:26,800 --> 00:29:27,920
 That's what I've been saying for years.

572
00:29:27,920 --> 00:29:28,400
 Yeah, yeah.

573
00:29:28,400 --> 00:29:30,320
 When we're on tar, you always tell your wife,

574
00:29:30,320 --> 00:29:32,720
 "Oh, I've been sleeping around for the last two weeks."

575
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:33,280
 Absolutely.

576
00:29:33,280 --> 00:29:39,600
 But they sleep leaning over.

577
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:40,400
 If they're in captivity,

578
00:29:40,400 --> 00:29:43,520
 they'll just lean up against the edge of their pool and sleep there,

579
00:29:43,520 --> 00:29:46,880
 or they sleep on the bottom of the water as well, which is magical.

580
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:48,800
 But briefly, because otherwise they will die.

581
00:29:48,800 --> 00:29:51,520
 That's the most common way they sleep is on the bottom of the water,

582
00:29:51,520 --> 00:29:54,880
 but then they come, like you say, wake up every now and then just to breathe.

583
00:29:54,880 --> 00:29:58,720
 It's every three minutes they have to come up to the surface.

584
00:29:58,720 --> 00:29:59,600
 Really?

585
00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:01,600
 Yeah, it's just a nap, really, that they're having.

586
00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:04,640
 But they can sleep up to 90 hours, can't they?

587
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:06,560
 So that's a hell of a...

588
00:30:06,560 --> 00:30:09,760
 When they're doing the 19-hour sleep, they're somewhere much more comfortable.

589
00:30:09,760 --> 00:30:14,640
 Yeah, that is like having such severe sleep apnea, really, isn't it?

590
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:16,240
 Is it just every three minutes?

591
00:30:16,240 --> 00:30:18,000
 You're like, "Oh, my God."

592
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:19,840
 Yeah, but they can sleep for 19 hours,

593
00:30:19,840 --> 00:30:23,680
 but they can also swim nonstop for 84 hours sometimes.

594
00:30:23,680 --> 00:30:26,080
 So they're just pretty hardcore.

595
00:30:26,080 --> 00:30:31,120
 Isn't that one of the longest that any animal is known to stay awake

596
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:32,240
 in one go?

597
00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:33,280
 It's very unusual.

598
00:30:33,280 --> 00:30:37,040
 So humans can stay awake that late, that long.

599
00:30:37,040 --> 00:30:41,920
 But if you stay awake that long, you're going to do yourself some damage,

600
00:30:41,920 --> 00:30:45,600
 and you basically have to have someone holding your eyes open the whole time.

601
00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:47,840
 So it is possible, but it's really unusual,

602
00:30:47,840 --> 00:30:50,960
 but they actually do it semi-regularly, so...

603
00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:54,240
 Just actually how they manage to go up and down in the water is quite interesting, actually.

604
00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:56,880
 So when they do wake up on the bottom and need to get to the top,

605
00:30:56,880 --> 00:31:00,960
 they've got pharyngeal pouches, which are these air sacs between

606
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:04,160
 like sort of their throat and their chest around their sternum,

607
00:31:04,160 --> 00:31:08,240
 and they can hold 50 litres of air, which is about the same,

608
00:31:08,240 --> 00:31:12,240
 I realised, as four party balloons, which actually I was most surprised at

609
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:14,160
 how many litres of air a party balloon can take.

610
00:31:14,160 --> 00:31:16,400
 Well, that's a lot though, isn't it?

611
00:31:16,400 --> 00:31:19,280
 Because presumably it must blow up like a party balloon.

612
00:31:19,280 --> 00:31:22,560
 Yes, you can actually see the little lumps, I think, can't you,

613
00:31:22,560 --> 00:31:25,200
 when they're inflated, and that takes them to the top,

614
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:27,520
 and that means that they can bob up and down vertically,

615
00:31:27,520 --> 00:31:28,880
 and I think they can sleep like that.

616
00:31:28,880 --> 00:31:31,360
 Wait, hang on Anna, it doesn't take them up to the top.

617
00:31:31,360 --> 00:31:34,400
 If they're at the bottom of the sea and they haven't remembered to inflate their pouches,

618
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:36,240
 there's nothing they can do about that, there.

619
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:39,040
 They use it to stay up when they're up.

620
00:31:39,040 --> 00:31:40,160
 Yeah, sorry.

621
00:31:40,160 --> 00:31:44,480
 When they breathe out, do they kind of fly around like a party balloon when you wake up?

622
00:31:44,480 --> 00:31:50,960
 Sometimes you hear that squeaking farting sound when you're in the sea like that.

623
00:31:50,960 --> 00:31:54,560
 Oh, that'd be terrifying, because they weigh over a tonne, some of them.

624
00:31:55,040 --> 00:31:58,560
 The one of those untethered in a room and flying around would do a lot of property damage.

625
00:31:58,560 --> 00:32:06,080
 They can eat as many as 6,000 clams in a single feeding session, and I went on to-

626
00:32:06,080 --> 00:32:07,040
 One walrus.

627
00:32:07,040 --> 00:32:14,240
 Yeah, one walrus in one session, 6,000 clams, and I went on to the website of a seafood merchant

628
00:32:14,240 --> 00:32:20,480
 in Borough Market, and that would cost £15,000 per meal if they bought their welks and clams

629
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:21,920
 from Borough Market.

630
00:32:21,920 --> 00:32:26,160
 I don't know what sort of lovey media walrus is you're thinking about, but Borough Market is

631
00:32:26,160 --> 00:32:28,240
 an expensive place to buy your clams.

632
00:32:28,240 --> 00:32:31,120
 They're so cool, they're so weird.

633
00:32:31,120 --> 00:32:35,040
 Their skin is amazingly thick, obviously, because they need to keep warm in the water,

634
00:32:35,040 --> 00:32:39,840
 but their skin is four centimetres thick, which is about 30 times thicker than human skin.

635
00:32:39,840 --> 00:32:43,840
 And then under that, they have another, is it 10 centimetres of blubber?

636
00:32:43,840 --> 00:32:45,920
 Which is, it's such a thick layer.

637
00:32:45,920 --> 00:32:48,160
 They're pretty toasty, I think, in the water.

638
00:32:48,160 --> 00:32:49,200
 There's a lot.

639
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:52,480
 And well, they're so heavy that a good way to hunt them if you're a polar bear,

640
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:57,120
 if there are any polar bears listening, is to cause a stampede.

641
00:32:57,120 --> 00:33:01,040
 So they're actually quite difficult to hunt as a polar bear because they're so massive

642
00:33:01,040 --> 00:33:01,520
 on their own.

643
00:33:01,520 --> 00:33:05,920
 It's quite hard to kill one on its own, but they always hang out together in huge groups,

644
00:33:05,920 --> 00:33:09,680
 and they're so heavy that if you start chasing them, they'll stampede over each other,

645
00:33:09,680 --> 00:33:12,640
 and they'll often crush a few of them, a few of each other on the way,

646
00:33:12,640 --> 00:33:14,960
 and then you can pick up the leftovers.

647
00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:17,360
 The young ones are incredibly cute.

648
00:33:17,920 --> 00:33:21,200
 I know we were saying the bigger ones might not appear cute.

649
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:21,760
 I think they are.

650
00:33:21,760 --> 00:33:23,120
 But the young ones definitely are.

651
00:33:23,120 --> 00:33:25,760
 And they're also really sweet with humans as well.

652
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:31,280
 So there's been a few scientists that have talked about the fact that when a baby walrus

653
00:33:31,280 --> 00:33:36,800
 is, when they're working with baby walruses, it will sort of rest its head on the scientist's lap.

654
00:33:36,800 --> 00:33:40,160
 And then it won't feel just content with that.

655
00:33:40,160 --> 00:33:44,880
 It will try and climb onto the scientists as if to just cuddle it in a way that a small puppy

656
00:33:44,880 --> 00:33:48,320
 would just want to get on top of you and sort of cuddle into you.

657
00:33:48,320 --> 00:33:50,080
 That is quite cute.

658
00:33:50,080 --> 00:33:53,360
 But what if it thinks you're an ice floe and then tries to dig it?

659
00:33:53,360 --> 00:33:55,520
 That's what it feels like.

660
00:33:55,520 --> 00:33:56,880
 These are humans with ice floes.

661
00:33:56,880 --> 00:33:58,400
 Yeah, they're not musseldwells, mate.

662
00:33:58,400 --> 00:34:00,000
 They're not just going to go stab at anyone.

663
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:04,160
 It feels like they're climbing on top of you like they think you're a lump of ice or something.

664
00:34:04,160 --> 00:34:07,360
 I think it's because they're thigmo-tactic.

665
00:34:07,360 --> 00:34:10,080
 So they're very similar to earwigs in this one way,

666
00:34:10,080 --> 00:34:14,240
 which is that they're positively thigmo-tactic, which means that they love being touched.

667
00:34:14,240 --> 00:34:15,920
 They're incredibly social, like you say.

668
00:34:15,920 --> 00:34:18,400
 And that's why they're often huddled together in big groups

669
00:34:18,400 --> 00:34:20,720
 because they are always touching each other.

670
00:34:20,720 --> 00:34:24,080
 90% of walruses will be touching another walrus when they land.

671
00:34:24,080 --> 00:34:28,720
 And so when you look after them, when they're in captivity,

672
00:34:28,720 --> 00:34:31,680
 like at the Alaska Sea Life Center, I think, for instance,

673
00:34:31,680 --> 00:34:35,280
 they employ four people round the clock per walrus

674
00:34:35,280 --> 00:34:37,520
 to be there just hugging it and keeping it in front of them.

675
00:34:37,520 --> 00:34:38,800
 Oh, no.

676
00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:39,600
 Wow.

677
00:34:39,600 --> 00:34:40,960
 That's what they do.

678
00:34:40,960 --> 00:34:43,440
 Four walrus huggers for every walrus.

679
00:34:43,440 --> 00:34:43,920
 Wow.

680
00:34:43,920 --> 00:34:46,000
 I think they serve other purposes as well.

681
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:46,880
 You know, they feed them.

682
00:34:46,880 --> 00:34:49,680
 You can't do much while you're hugging a walrus, you know.

683
00:34:49,680 --> 00:34:50,960
 You can be on your phone.

684
00:34:50,960 --> 00:34:51,680
 You can be on your phone.

685
00:34:51,680 --> 00:34:52,400
 Yeah, you're right.

686
00:34:52,400 --> 00:34:57,040
 But then, I mean, no one wants to be hugged by someone who's also,

687
00:34:57,040 --> 00:34:58,880
 like, doob-scrolling down Switzerland.

688
00:34:58,880 --> 00:34:59,920
 That is a really good point.

689
00:34:59,920 --> 00:35:01,600
 No, the walruses do have a tendency to go,

690
00:35:01,600 --> 00:35:03,920
 "Look, can you put your phone down for having a moment?"

691
00:35:03,920 --> 00:35:09,280
 I was looking up an experiment that was done on walruses,

692
00:35:09,280 --> 00:35:11,280
 and this was in 2009.

693
00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:12,720
 You know Six Flags?

694
00:35:12,720 --> 00:35:14,560
 The theme park in America?

695
00:35:14,560 --> 00:35:14,880
 No.

696
00:35:14,880 --> 00:35:18,080
 So, it's a huge chain of theme parks in America,

697
00:35:18,080 --> 00:35:21,600
 and they have a few branches all over the place.

698
00:35:21,600 --> 00:35:24,640
 But in 2009, Six Flags in California

699
00:35:24,640 --> 00:35:27,040
 built an artificial walrus vagina.

700
00:35:27,040 --> 00:35:28,160
 Did they?

701
00:35:28,160 --> 00:35:28,880
 Okay.

702
00:35:28,880 --> 00:35:29,360
 Yeah.

703
00:35:29,360 --> 00:35:30,240
 Like a roller coaster.

704
00:35:30,240 --> 00:35:34,720
 It was not for the public to have a go on.

705
00:35:34,720 --> 00:35:35,680
 Oh, okay.

706
00:35:35,680 --> 00:35:36,640
 What was it for then?

707
00:35:36,640 --> 00:35:37,520
 It's in a theme park.

708
00:35:37,520 --> 00:35:39,120
 It's a walrus vagina?

709
00:35:39,120 --> 00:35:39,600
 Yeah.

710
00:35:39,600 --> 00:35:42,960
 This is an animal-focused branch of the theme park,

711
00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:44,960
 and they had a few walruses in,

712
00:35:44,960 --> 00:35:48,240
 and they wanted their walrus civuqueck

713
00:35:48,240 --> 00:35:51,200
 to perform some sexual acts,

714
00:35:51,200 --> 00:35:54,560
 so they could get their first ever semen sample of walrus.

715
00:35:54,560 --> 00:35:55,840
 Oh, I see.

716
00:35:55,840 --> 00:35:56,160
 Yeah.

717
00:35:56,160 --> 00:35:59,840
 And there was a scientist called Holly Marasso,

718
00:35:59,840 --> 00:36:01,680
 or Maracca, I'm not sure how that's pronounced.

719
00:36:01,680 --> 00:36:05,280
 But she was in charge of this,

720
00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:08,320
 and the largest artificial vagina on the market

721
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:09,200
 was too small.

722
00:36:09,200 --> 00:36:12,240
 They did buy one, which was used for cart horses,

723
00:36:12,240 --> 00:36:14,480
 but it was tiny compared to what civuqueck needed.

724
00:36:14,480 --> 00:36:16,320
 If they come to my and summer's party

725
00:36:16,320 --> 00:36:17,280
 that I had last week.

726
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:21,280
 Well, his penis was 22 inches around,

727
00:36:21,280 --> 00:36:24,240
 and they had to custom-build it from a big old pipe,

728
00:36:24,240 --> 00:36:26,240
 because it was just too huge.

729
00:36:26,240 --> 00:36:27,120
 That's amazing.

730
00:36:27,120 --> 00:36:28,400
 And I wrote to her.

731
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:29,200
 I wrote to the scientist,

732
00:36:29,200 --> 00:36:30,640
 but she hasn't got back in touch with me.

733
00:36:30,640 --> 00:36:33,120
 So I said, yeah, amazingly.

734
00:36:37,120 --> 00:36:39,360
 Sally, I don't think it worked, did it?

735
00:36:39,360 --> 00:36:42,160
 I think civuqueck died childless.

736
00:36:42,160 --> 00:36:45,520
 He was very obedient, though, I think, civuqueck.

737
00:36:45,520 --> 00:36:47,840
 So he was very good at exposing himself,

738
00:36:47,840 --> 00:36:50,080
 and she learned what turned him on.

739
00:36:50,080 --> 00:36:52,160
 So she realized that when there were workmen

740
00:36:52,160 --> 00:36:55,040
 using power tools, hammers and stuff nearby,

741
00:36:55,040 --> 00:36:56,640
 he would expose his penis,

742
00:36:56,640 --> 00:36:58,720
 and that he just particularly liked those sounds.

743
00:36:58,720 --> 00:37:00,240
 He was aroused by them.

744
00:37:00,240 --> 00:37:03,520
 And so eventually they made these certain noises

745
00:37:03,520 --> 00:37:05,200
 to make him expose himself,

746
00:37:05,200 --> 00:37:06,560
 and then they trained him,

747
00:37:06,560 --> 00:37:08,400
 eventually, to roll over and expose himself

748
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:09,680
 on the word penis.

749
00:37:09,680 --> 00:37:11,200
 So you just shouted, "Penis!"

750
00:37:11,200 --> 00:37:14,400
 Imagine if you listened to this podcast.

751
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:18,240
 He'd never get back on his back again.

752
00:37:18,240 --> 00:37:23,440
 One thing I find interesting about walrus vaginas, actually,

753
00:37:23,440 --> 00:37:26,400
 and I assume this is true of lots of other animals,

754
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:27,920
 but I'd never seen it before,

755
00:37:27,920 --> 00:37:31,360
 is male walruses are famous for having

756
00:37:31,360 --> 00:37:33,600
 bones in their penises, the baculum,

757
00:37:33,600 --> 00:37:36,480
 which is the longest, I think, in the animal kingdom,

758
00:37:36,480 --> 00:37:38,000
 the walrus baculum.

759
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:42,400
 But they also have a clitoral bone walruses.

760
00:37:42,400 --> 00:37:44,720
 So they have a bone in the clitoris.

761
00:37:44,720 --> 00:37:47,200
 And this is something that does happen in a few animals,

762
00:37:47,200 --> 00:37:51,280
 but is obviously less common than the penis bone.

763
00:37:51,280 --> 00:37:53,440
 And it's called a borbellum.

764
00:37:53,440 --> 00:37:54,720
 I've never heard that word before.

765
00:37:54,720 --> 00:37:59,360
 A clitoral, a borbellum, B-A-U-B-E-W-L-U-M.

766
00:37:59,360 --> 00:38:02,720
 And that's what you call a clitoris bone.

767
00:38:02,720 --> 00:38:03,840
 So look out for that word.

768
00:38:03,840 --> 00:38:08,800
 Their teeth are very crucial, as in their tusks.

769
00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:10,880
 So they have a hierarchical system,

770
00:38:10,880 --> 00:38:13,280
 but the most important thing to your social status,

771
00:38:13,280 --> 00:38:15,760
 they think in walrus hierarchies is the tusk.

772
00:38:15,760 --> 00:38:18,480
 So if you break a tooth, if you have a bike accident or something,

773
00:38:18,480 --> 00:38:21,600
 then suddenly you go from being the most sought after desirable man on the block

774
00:38:21,600 --> 00:38:22,320
 to being nothing.

775
00:38:22,320 --> 00:38:24,000
 Wow, so weird.

776
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:25,120
 Oh, that's awful.

777
00:38:25,120 --> 00:38:27,520
 They do walk on them, don't they?

778
00:38:27,520 --> 00:38:28,560
 On their teeth.

779
00:38:28,560 --> 00:38:29,120
 What do you mean?

780
00:38:29,120 --> 00:38:31,280
 They sort of walk on them.

781
00:38:31,280 --> 00:38:36,080
 And in fact, their scientific name is odobanus rosmarus,

782
00:38:36,080 --> 00:38:38,400
 which literally means tooth walking seahorse.

783
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:40,800
 It's a combination of latter than old Norse.

784
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:45,600
 And it's because they jam their tusks into the ice to drag themselves along.

785
00:38:45,600 --> 00:38:48,000
 A bit like locking onto the icebergs.

786
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:48,560
 Yeah, they do.

787
00:38:48,560 --> 00:38:50,640
 And they also use them to break up the ice.

788
00:38:50,640 --> 00:38:56,560
 So there was an example of the females get very protective over their children.

789
00:38:56,560 --> 00:38:59,600
 So if you get in between the child and the mother,

790
00:38:59,600 --> 00:39:01,040
 then she'll come after you.

791
00:39:01,040 --> 00:39:04,400
 And there was an example of some scientists kind of moving a child

792
00:39:04,400 --> 00:39:05,680
 from one place to another.

793
00:39:05,680 --> 00:39:10,000
 And the mother came after them and kind of slammed her face down

794
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:14,640
 with her tusks into the ice and used it as an ice breaker to open up the route.

795
00:39:14,640 --> 00:39:16,400
 So she could swim through it.

796
00:39:16,400 --> 00:39:18,160
 Wow, that's so cool.

797
00:39:18,160 --> 00:39:18,640
 It's scary.

798
00:39:18,640 --> 00:39:21,120
 That's the stuff in horror films.

799
00:39:21,120 --> 00:39:23,280
 I know because they swim really fast as well.

800
00:39:23,280 --> 00:39:25,840
 Like they can swim three times faster than Michael Phelps.

801
00:39:25,840 --> 00:39:30,640
 So 22 miles an hour max speed.

802
00:39:30,640 --> 00:39:34,400
 So imagine that coming at you with smashing down its tusks

803
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:38,320
 and swimming at three times as fast as Michael Phelps down still cute or...

804
00:39:38,320 --> 00:39:42,480
 I, all I'm thinking is Earl Tupper missed a trick by getting just fish.

805
00:39:42,480 --> 00:39:43,680
 He should have strapped a walrus.

806
00:39:43,680 --> 00:39:53,120
 OK, it is time for our final fact of the show.

807
00:39:53,120 --> 00:39:54,320
 And that is my fact.

808
00:39:54,320 --> 00:39:59,120
 My fact this week is that for many years, the horror film The Unknown was missing.

809
00:39:59,680 --> 00:40:02,320
 Because the last surviving print was accidentally placed

810
00:40:02,320 --> 00:40:05,600
 into a pile of hundreds of film cans all marked unknown.

811
00:40:05,600 --> 00:40:10,560
 So this was a movie that was made in 1927.

812
00:40:10,560 --> 00:40:12,800
 And it was fairly popular in its time.

813
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:15,120
 It started a very big actor called Lon Chaney.

814
00:40:15,120 --> 00:40:18,720
 And the prints, as for a lot of movies around this time,

815
00:40:18,720 --> 00:40:20,960
 just went missing and no one knew where it was.

816
00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:24,320
 And in 1973, after years and years of it being missing,

817
00:40:24,320 --> 00:40:28,880
 it was discovered in the archives of the Cinématec Française,

818
00:40:28,880 --> 00:40:33,600
 which is a big institution in France that has lots of archived movies.

819
00:40:33,600 --> 00:40:36,160
 And someone must have accidentally taken their copy

820
00:40:36,160 --> 00:40:40,240
 and popped it into a big room that had a bunch of unknowns

821
00:40:40,240 --> 00:40:42,640
 of films that had no information about them.

822
00:40:42,640 --> 00:40:45,680
 And so there it sat for all these years until they uncovered it.

823
00:40:45,680 --> 00:40:48,560
 And it's great that we have it again.

824
00:40:48,560 --> 00:40:50,720
 Because as I say, Lon Chaney, big deal in his day.

825
00:40:50,720 --> 00:40:52,720
 Sounds like an amazing movie, doesn't it?

826
00:40:52,720 --> 00:40:52,960
 Yeah.

827
00:40:52,960 --> 00:40:56,720
 It's about, well, it's about this guy who is a criminal

828
00:40:57,440 --> 00:41:01,520
 and he goes to the circus pretending to be someone with no arms.

829
00:41:01,520 --> 00:41:05,920
 And so to do that, he kind of ties his arms to his torso

830
00:41:05,920 --> 00:41:08,080
 and then wears a shirt and a clove

831
00:41:08,080 --> 00:41:10,240
 so no one can tell that he actually has arms.

832
00:41:10,240 --> 00:41:14,160
 And then he falls in love with this woman, Nanon,

833
00:41:14,160 --> 00:41:16,720
 played by Joan Crawford before she became really famous.

834
00:41:16,720 --> 00:41:20,880
 And she is terrified of being touched by men.

835
00:41:20,880 --> 00:41:23,360
 So that works even better that he doesn't have any arms,

836
00:41:23,360 --> 00:41:24,480
 even though he does have arms.

837
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:25,520
 And then...

838
00:41:25,520 --> 00:41:27,440
 Much made in heaven, that's so sweet.

839
00:41:27,440 --> 00:41:28,560
 I know, isn't it?

840
00:41:28,560 --> 00:41:31,280
 And then, well, it is until she finds out on his wedding night

841
00:41:31,280 --> 00:41:32,480
 that he has arms.

842
00:41:32,480 --> 00:41:34,160
 Oh, no.

843
00:41:34,160 --> 00:41:40,560
 Anyway, so he then has a rival called Zanzi and kills him.

844
00:41:40,560 --> 00:41:44,240
 But the police can't take any fingerprints from him

845
00:41:44,240 --> 00:41:45,520
 because he doesn't have any arms.

846
00:41:45,520 --> 00:41:47,200
 And so he escapes.

847
00:41:47,200 --> 00:41:47,920
 How does he kill him?

848
00:41:47,920 --> 00:41:49,600
 He has arms.

849
00:41:49,600 --> 00:41:50,080
 He has arms.

850
00:41:50,080 --> 00:41:52,400
 Oh, sorry, everyone thinks that he doesn't have arms.

851
00:41:52,400 --> 00:41:54,880
 Oh, God, I fell into his trap thinking he didn't have arms.

852
00:41:54,880 --> 00:41:55,760
 I should have known.

853
00:41:55,760 --> 00:41:57,600
 Did he kill him?

854
00:41:57,600 --> 00:42:00,000
 Because Zanzi or whatever he's called, saw that he had arms.

855
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:01,520
 And he was like, there's nothing left to do now,

856
00:42:01,520 --> 00:42:02,560
 but for me to kill you.

857
00:42:02,560 --> 00:42:03,040
 You know what?

858
00:42:03,040 --> 00:42:04,320
 I've gone too far already,

859
00:42:04,320 --> 00:42:06,560
 because we're always giving away spoilers on this show.

860
00:42:06,560 --> 00:42:08,400
 And I get so much shit for it on Twitter.

861
00:42:08,400 --> 00:42:10,480
 I'm not going to tell you what happens at the end of this movie,

862
00:42:10,480 --> 00:42:11,520
 but it's really good.

863
00:42:11,520 --> 00:42:13,760
 And one amazing thing about it is that...

864
00:42:13,760 --> 00:42:15,920
 What was the name of the guy who played him, Dan?

865
00:42:15,920 --> 00:42:19,520
 Lon Chaney, C-H-A-N-E-Y, Chaney, you reckon?

866
00:42:19,520 --> 00:42:20,880
 Lon Chaney, yeah, that's right.

867
00:42:20,880 --> 00:42:24,000
 But he had a stunt double called Paul Desmouc,

868
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:25,760
 who didn't have any arms,

869
00:42:25,760 --> 00:42:27,600
 because in the play,

870
00:42:27,600 --> 00:42:31,120
 the character had to drink with his feet,

871
00:42:31,120 --> 00:42:33,840
 or he had to throw things for his feet in the circus.

872
00:42:33,840 --> 00:42:34,960
 He was like a knife thrower,

873
00:42:34,960 --> 00:42:36,480
 but he did it all with his feet.

874
00:42:36,480 --> 00:42:39,280
 And so he had this actual performer called Paul Desmouc,

875
00:42:39,280 --> 00:42:40,720
 who would do all this stuff for him.

876
00:42:40,720 --> 00:42:42,720
 And the way that they did it

877
00:42:42,720 --> 00:42:44,480
 is sometimes he would double for him

878
00:42:44,480 --> 00:42:46,080
 if you could do it with the shots and stuff,

879
00:42:46,080 --> 00:42:47,600
 if you could not see his face.

880
00:42:47,600 --> 00:42:50,640
 But most of the time, Desmouc was doing the same job,

881
00:42:50,640 --> 00:42:52,960
 but he was doing it just with his legs

882
00:42:52,960 --> 00:42:57,200
 and perfectly synchronized his legs with the actor's body.

883
00:42:57,200 --> 00:42:58,320
 And so they cut it.

884
00:42:58,320 --> 00:43:00,320
 So you only saw the top of the actor's body

885
00:43:00,320 --> 00:43:02,320
 and the bottom of the stunt double's legs,

886
00:43:02,320 --> 00:43:03,680
 and so they could do all that stuff.

887
00:43:03,680 --> 00:43:04,320
 Isn't that cool?

888
00:43:04,320 --> 00:43:05,200
 That's so clever.

889
00:43:05,200 --> 00:43:08,800
 So a man with no arms pretending to be a man with arms

890
00:43:08,800 --> 00:43:10,240
 pretending to be a man with no arms.

891
00:43:10,240 --> 00:43:12,320
 It's many layers.

892
00:43:12,320 --> 00:43:15,600
 It's like the Shakespearean boys pretending to be girls to be boys,

893
00:43:15,600 --> 00:43:16,240
 isn't it?

894
00:43:16,240 --> 00:43:16,320
 Yeah.

895
00:43:16,320 --> 00:43:16,480
 Yeah.

896
00:43:16,480 --> 00:43:18,640
 And that's on my blur.

897
00:43:18,640 --> 00:43:19,120
 Is that?

898
00:43:19,120 --> 00:43:19,360
 Yeah.

899
00:43:20,960 --> 00:43:23,440
 Boys with no arms who like girls, who have arms,

900
00:43:23,440 --> 00:43:25,360
 but hate men who have arms.

901
00:43:25,360 --> 00:43:30,000
 Dan, you mentioned Lon Cheney.

902
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:30,800
 Yeah.

903
00:43:30,800 --> 00:43:32,240
 He does sound incredible.

904
00:43:32,240 --> 00:43:32,400
 Yeah.

905
00:43:32,400 --> 00:43:35,200
 So he played so many different things.

906
00:43:35,200 --> 00:43:39,120
 He was called the man of a thousand faces

907
00:43:39,120 --> 00:43:41,280
 because he appeared in all these different costumes,

908
00:43:41,280 --> 00:43:42,480
 all these different roles.

909
00:43:42,480 --> 00:43:44,320
 I mean, I've written down clowns and pirates.

910
00:43:44,320 --> 00:43:46,320
 I imagine his brain was even broader than that.

911
00:43:46,320 --> 00:43:48,800
 He played lots of foreign people,

912
00:43:48,800 --> 00:43:51,360
 which obviously you probably wouldn't do today.

913
00:43:51,360 --> 00:43:54,000
 But in the 1920s, he played so many different roles

914
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:56,240
 and kinds of person that there was a popular joke.

915
00:43:56,240 --> 00:43:57,120
 And this was the joke.

916
00:43:57,120 --> 00:43:59,280
 It was, don't step on that spider.

917
00:43:59,280 --> 00:44:00,640
 It might be Lon Cheney.

918
00:44:00,640 --> 00:44:01,760
 Well, that's familiar.

919
00:44:01,760 --> 00:44:07,440
 And he was a master of disguise in terms of his dedication

920
00:44:07,440 --> 00:44:10,400
 to makeup within the movies he was in.

921
00:44:10,400 --> 00:44:11,840
 So like there's, for example, there's one movie

922
00:44:11,840 --> 00:44:13,760
 where he plays both the hero and the villain.

923
00:44:13,760 --> 00:44:17,600
 And he was so convinced that his makeup could transform that.

924
00:44:17,600 --> 00:44:20,640
 When he played Quasimodo in The Hunchback of Notre Dame,

925
00:44:20,640 --> 00:44:23,440
 he took the idea of having a growth over his eye

926
00:44:23,440 --> 00:44:26,000
 so seriously that with the makeup done,

927
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:29,120
 it resulted in him having permanent short-sightedness

928
00:44:29,120 --> 00:44:32,080
 of the stress that he put on, onto his body.

929
00:44:32,080 --> 00:44:34,480
 He often used to put himself in physical pain

930
00:44:34,480 --> 00:44:36,320
 in order to get that appearance right.

931
00:44:36,320 --> 00:44:40,400
 So he, when he was playing a legless criminal mastermind.

932
00:44:40,400 --> 00:44:43,200
 So he, in another movie, played a legless criminal.

933
00:44:43,200 --> 00:44:47,040
 He bound his legs into a tight harness.

934
00:44:47,040 --> 00:44:50,160
 And that actually cut off a lot of blood vessels in his legs

935
00:44:50,160 --> 00:44:52,480
 so that he did kind of lose the use of his legs.

936
00:44:52,480 --> 00:44:54,240
 Oh, right. But then for the sequel,

937
00:44:54,240 --> 00:44:55,840
 he didn't have to have a stunt double.

938
00:44:55,840 --> 00:44:57,040
 So that was useful.

939
00:44:57,040 --> 00:44:58,560
 So yeah, exactly.

940
00:44:58,560 --> 00:45:00,640
 But yeah, and he was a big guy.

941
00:45:00,640 --> 00:45:03,520
 He was a silent movie guy that was in that transfer

942
00:45:03,520 --> 00:45:04,960
 to the talkies.

943
00:45:04,960 --> 00:45:08,160
 And in fact, when it became the talkies,

944
00:45:08,160 --> 00:45:10,960
 it was so interesting, he wrote for his first movie

945
00:45:10,960 --> 00:45:13,040
 because he did five different voices

946
00:45:13,040 --> 00:45:15,200
 in his first ever talking movie.

947
00:45:15,200 --> 00:45:17,280
 He signed a statement to attest to the fact

948
00:45:17,280 --> 00:45:18,960
 that it was in fact his voices.

949
00:45:18,960 --> 00:45:22,560
 And this was sort of published so that people believed

950
00:45:22,560 --> 00:45:24,480
 that it was him who had an actual voice

951
00:45:24,480 --> 00:45:25,360
 and that he was talking.

952
00:45:25,360 --> 00:45:28,880
 Was that publicity for the film?

953
00:45:28,880 --> 00:45:31,280
 So because people wanted to hear him talk?

954
00:45:31,280 --> 00:45:32,000
 Yes, exactly.

955
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:33,440
 No, it was publicity just to say,

956
00:45:33,440 --> 00:45:35,360
 you may think that this is being dubbed.

957
00:45:35,360 --> 00:45:36,880
 I'm not just the man of a thousand faces.

958
00:45:36,880 --> 00:45:37,840
 I also do voices.

959
00:45:37,840 --> 00:45:41,760
 And the man of a thousand faces, five voices, no legs.

960
00:45:44,720 --> 00:45:47,680
 Yeah, these lost films are incredible.

961
00:45:47,680 --> 00:45:49,680
 The ones that keep popping up everywhere.

962
00:45:49,680 --> 00:45:53,120
 And you mentioned the Cinématec Francaise, was it, Dan?

963
00:45:53,120 --> 00:45:53,760
 Yes.

964
00:45:53,760 --> 00:45:56,640
 They have been recategorising their films since 1992.

965
00:45:56,640 --> 00:46:00,000
 So nearly 30 years now,

966
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:01,680
 and they still have another decade to go.

967
00:46:01,680 --> 00:46:03,600
 They've just got so many films that they're trying

968
00:46:03,600 --> 00:46:05,040
 to work out what they all are.

969
00:46:05,040 --> 00:46:07,840
 It's quite hard to tell the difference between a lost film

970
00:46:07,840 --> 00:46:09,840
 and a film that no one's looked for yet.

971
00:46:09,840 --> 00:46:12,160
 I think this is a problem that the BFI had

972
00:46:12,160 --> 00:46:17,200
 when they created, in 2010, their 75 Most Wanted Films List.

973
00:46:17,200 --> 00:46:20,160
 And they've been finding them at a rate of knots, really.

974
00:46:20,160 --> 00:46:22,240
 I mean, as soon as they publish it, people are getting in touch,

975
00:46:22,240 --> 00:46:23,920
 going, oh yeah, I got the DVD of that.

976
00:46:23,920 --> 00:46:24,800
 Yeah, yeah, here you go.

977
00:46:24,800 --> 00:46:28,320
 Which is such great news.

978
00:46:28,320 --> 00:46:30,960
 So of the top 75, they've discovered 18.

979
00:46:30,960 --> 00:46:33,840
 I think maybe one of them, or a film that was famously lost,

980
00:46:33,840 --> 00:46:39,280
 was Gaslight, which is interesting because the reason it was lost

981
00:46:39,280 --> 00:46:44,240
 is because MGM tried to gaslight us into thinking it didn't exist,

982
00:46:44,240 --> 00:46:45,840
 confusingly.

983
00:46:45,840 --> 00:46:50,240
 So this was the original film called Gaslight was released in 1940,

984
00:46:50,240 --> 00:46:52,080
 and I think it was a British version.

985
00:46:52,080 --> 00:46:55,680
 And then MGM got the rights to it and released it in 1944,

986
00:46:55,680 --> 00:46:57,520
 but they got the rights on the one condition

987
00:46:57,520 --> 00:46:59,680
 that all copies of the 1940 film,

988
00:46:59,680 --> 00:47:01,840
 even all the negatives, were completely destroyed.

989
00:47:01,840 --> 00:47:04,080
 So if anyone said, what's the film Gaslight?

990
00:47:04,080 --> 00:47:05,120
 They'd be, it's this one.

991
00:47:05,120 --> 00:47:06,000
 What are you talking about?

992
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:08,080
 This is the film Gaslight.

993
00:47:08,080 --> 00:47:11,040
 And the only reason, actually, we have the original 1941

994
00:47:11,040 --> 00:47:14,000
 is because the director of it, who was called Thorold Dickinson,

995
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:16,640
 for much cooler names in the olden days,

996
00:47:16,640 --> 00:47:18,400
 had made his own personal copy.

997
00:47:18,400 --> 00:47:20,960
 And so he went and produced it.

998
00:47:20,960 --> 00:47:24,000
 And that's where the word gaslighting today comes from, isn't it?

999
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:26,880
 Because it was the movie, maybe based on a novel,

1000
00:47:26,880 --> 00:47:30,000
 I'm not sure, but it's based on someone's boyfriend

1001
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:32,400
 who tries to convince her that she's gone mad or something.

1002
00:47:32,400 --> 00:47:34,880
 Yeah, based on the player, I think.

1003
00:47:34,880 --> 00:47:36,720
 It's, isn't it, he tries to convince her

1004
00:47:36,720 --> 00:47:40,160
 that it's something to do with gaslighting in the house?

1005
00:47:40,160 --> 00:47:42,480
 I can't remember what he's explaining or it's, yeah.

1006
00:47:42,480 --> 00:47:46,480
 Yeah, so he's always, he basically makes the lights go down lower.

1007
00:47:46,480 --> 00:47:49,680
 And then she, who's played by Ingrid Bergman, says,

1008
00:47:49,680 --> 00:47:50,880
 the lights have gone lower.

1009
00:47:50,880 --> 00:47:52,400
 And he says, no, they're not, you've gone mad.

1010
00:47:52,400 --> 00:47:54,640
 And then he does lots of other stuff.

1011
00:47:54,640 --> 00:47:56,480
 But he shouldn't, I mean, that's not a really

1012
00:47:56,480 --> 00:47:58,720
 an obvious symptom of going mad, is it really?

1013
00:47:58,720 --> 00:48:00,720
 He should have like dressed as a rabbit

1014
00:48:00,720 --> 00:48:03,840
 and danced around in the front room and said, did you see that?

1015
00:48:03,840 --> 00:48:04,800
 He's like, what are you on about?

1016
00:48:04,800 --> 00:48:05,680
 That would be...

1017
00:48:05,680 --> 00:48:06,800
 That was the next scene.

1018
00:48:06,800 --> 00:48:09,120
 He should have got Lon Chaney in to do one of his

1019
00:48:09,120 --> 00:48:11,200
 weird jumping around with no arm.

1020
00:48:11,200 --> 00:48:13,760
 Lon Chaney appears to be stuck in the bath.

1021
00:48:13,760 --> 00:48:14,960
 No, no.

1022
00:48:14,960 --> 00:48:18,080
 What are you on about?

1023
00:48:18,080 --> 00:48:20,720
 Just your mind playing tricks again.

1024
00:48:20,720 --> 00:48:21,360
 Oh, that's it.

1025
00:48:21,360 --> 00:48:23,680
 Lon Chaney's back and this time he's got eight legs.

1026
00:48:23,680 --> 00:48:29,680
 One famous movie that's missing is

1027
00:48:29,680 --> 00:48:34,560
 The Arrival of a Train at Van Sen Station by Georges Mellier.

1028
00:48:34,560 --> 00:48:38,720
 So one of the oldest of all the cinematographers,

1029
00:48:38,720 --> 00:48:41,440
 a French guy who did lots of really early,

1030
00:48:41,440 --> 00:48:44,000
 very, very short movies of things happening.

1031
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:47,200
 For instance, trains arriving at stations and stuff like that.

1032
00:48:47,200 --> 00:48:49,680
 But what I find really interesting about this one

1033
00:48:49,680 --> 00:48:54,000
 is an 1896 film, which we don't know where it is.

1034
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:57,680
 But what we do have is we have a flip book of the film,

1035
00:48:58,240 --> 00:49:02,240
 which in 1896 is essentially the same thing.

1036
00:49:02,240 --> 00:49:02,960
 Yeah, so cool.

1037
00:49:02,960 --> 00:49:06,480
 The one just every frame has become a page in the book.

1038
00:49:06,480 --> 00:49:06,960
 Wow.

1039
00:49:06,960 --> 00:49:09,280
 Have they stitched it back together to turn it back into a film?

1040
00:49:09,280 --> 00:49:10,160
 They should do something.

1041
00:49:10,160 --> 00:49:12,080
 They should, because then they can say it's based on a book.

1042
00:49:12,080 --> 00:49:14,960
 That's popular for films.

1043
00:49:14,960 --> 00:49:19,840
 There is, weirdly, just a combo fact there.

1044
00:49:19,840 --> 00:49:23,120
 There's a myth that when film was in its infancy,

1045
00:49:23,120 --> 00:49:25,920
 there was a silent movie.

1046
00:49:25,920 --> 00:49:27,600
 It was just of a train arriving in a station.

1047
00:49:28,400 --> 00:49:30,160
 But I think it was face-on.

1048
00:49:30,160 --> 00:49:32,560
 It might have been by the Lumiere brothers.

1049
00:49:32,560 --> 00:49:34,960
 So the train is coming right towards the camera.

1050
00:49:34,960 --> 00:49:35,920
 Oh, yeah.

1051
00:49:35,920 --> 00:49:39,440
 There was a myth that this was so realistic and terrifying

1052
00:49:39,440 --> 00:49:42,160
 for the audience who'd never seen cinema before,

1053
00:49:42,160 --> 00:49:43,760
 that the audience bolted.

1054
00:49:43,760 --> 00:49:46,000
 They all shit themselves en masse.

1055
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:49,840
 Every one of the 500 people shit themselves.

1056
00:49:49,840 --> 00:49:53,680
 No, that's not the urban myth.

1057
00:49:53,680 --> 00:49:54,800
 It's a good urban myth.

1058
00:49:54,800 --> 00:49:56,000
 That's the one I've been spreading.

1059
00:49:56,240 --> 00:50:00,080
 Anyway, it doesn't seem to have ever happened.

1060
00:50:00,080 --> 00:50:00,560
 That's the thing.

1061
00:50:00,560 --> 00:50:03,760
 No one has ever bolted or shat themselves en masse

1062
00:50:03,760 --> 00:50:05,120
 if they still put it on a train.

1063
00:50:05,120 --> 00:50:07,600
 Another film which has gone missing

1064
00:50:07,600 --> 00:50:11,680
 is the first film ever directed by an African-American.

1065
00:50:11,680 --> 00:50:14,560
 And actually loads of these have gone missing.

1066
00:50:14,560 --> 00:50:16,560
 So there was a thing which I didn't know about,

1067
00:50:16,560 --> 00:50:21,680
 which went from 1915 all the way up to the 1950s called race films.

1068
00:50:21,680 --> 00:50:25,120
 And what it was was Hollywood was making all these movies.

1069
00:50:25,120 --> 00:50:26,480
 But at the same time,

1070
00:50:26,480 --> 00:50:29,600
 other people were making films specifically for black people.

1071
00:50:29,600 --> 00:50:30,960
 So you would have black directors.

1072
00:50:30,960 --> 00:50:32,160
 You would have black actors.

1073
00:50:32,160 --> 00:50:33,360
 You would have black producers.

1074
00:50:33,360 --> 00:50:35,840
 You'd have basically black people doing the whole thing.

1075
00:50:35,840 --> 00:50:38,080
 But they would only be shown in theaters

1076
00:50:38,080 --> 00:50:39,440
 that were usually segregated

1077
00:50:39,440 --> 00:50:41,360
 so that only black people could even watch them.

1078
00:50:41,360 --> 00:50:44,640
 And there were like hundreds and hundreds of these things made,

1079
00:50:44,640 --> 00:50:46,480
 but almost all of them went missing.

1080
00:50:46,480 --> 00:50:50,400
 And then in 1983, there was a place called

1081
00:50:50,400 --> 00:50:53,360
 the Southwest Film Video Archives in Dallas.

1082
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:57,440
 And they rang up this kind of historian and said,

1083
00:50:57,440 --> 00:50:59,440
 "Look, there's a load of old tapes here.

1084
00:50:59,440 --> 00:51:01,600
 They're just taking up a load of space.

1085
00:51:01,600 --> 00:51:02,880
 We're going to get rid of them.

1086
00:51:02,880 --> 00:51:04,480
 Do you want to have a look through them?"

1087
00:51:04,480 --> 00:51:06,480
 And he went, "Okay, well, I'm going to have a look through them."

1088
00:51:06,480 --> 00:51:08,960
 And it turned out that it was all of these old,

1089
00:51:08,960 --> 00:51:10,320
 what they call, race films.

1090
00:51:10,320 --> 00:51:11,920
 And now we have loads of them back

1091
00:51:11,920 --> 00:51:14,640
 and they're restoring them all and people can watch them again.

1092
00:51:14,640 --> 00:51:15,600
 - Wow. - Isn't that cool?

1093
00:51:15,600 --> 00:51:17,200
 That is so cool.

1094
00:51:17,200 --> 00:51:20,240
 It's amazing how little people thought ahead at the time.

1095
00:51:20,240 --> 00:51:21,440
 It's something that actually Alex,

1096
00:51:21,440 --> 00:51:24,000
 our colleague, gets really agitated about

1097
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:26,400
 when so much of the BBC's archives have gone missing

1098
00:51:26,400 --> 00:51:28,800
 because they just didn't really preserve stuff.

1099
00:51:28,800 --> 00:51:30,640
 - Well, they taped over it.

1100
00:51:30,640 --> 00:51:32,000
 It wasn't that it went missing.

1101
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:35,040
 They decided that all these tapes were useless,

1102
00:51:35,040 --> 00:51:36,720
 hanging out in the back rooms.

1103
00:51:36,720 --> 00:51:40,800
 Classic comedies that were made were all destroyed.

1104
00:51:40,800 --> 00:51:42,800
 So Peter Cook, British comedian,

1105
00:51:42,800 --> 00:51:45,280
 he begged the BBC to give him the tapes

1106
00:51:45,280 --> 00:51:46,480
 so that they wouldn't be destroyed.

1107
00:51:46,480 --> 00:51:48,000
 "I'll buy you new tapes," he said,

1108
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:49,200
 "and you can have fresh ones."

1109
00:51:49,200 --> 00:51:50,720
 And they still said, "No, it's our property,

1110
00:51:50,720 --> 00:51:53,120
 "so we're just going to make sure it's kind of destroyed."

1111
00:51:53,120 --> 00:51:55,120
 - No way. - Yeah, so it wasn't even lost.

1112
00:51:55,120 --> 00:51:56,400
 It was actively destroyed.

1113
00:51:56,400 --> 00:51:58,640
 - We should say why they also,

1114
00:51:58,640 --> 00:51:59,680
 why there are so few,

1115
00:51:59,680 --> 00:52:01,520
 another reason as apart from people destroying them

1116
00:52:01,520 --> 00:52:04,160
 is that they just burn so easily.

1117
00:52:04,160 --> 00:52:05,440
 They set on fire.

1118
00:52:05,440 --> 00:52:07,120
 The early film, "Nitrate" film,

1119
00:52:07,120 --> 00:52:09,360
 it can combust at 41 degrees Celsius.

1120
00:52:09,360 --> 00:52:11,440
 - And you're in LA.

1121
00:52:11,440 --> 00:52:14,240
 - I know, I mean, it's...

1122
00:52:14,240 --> 00:52:15,360
 And also the other problem is that

1123
00:52:15,360 --> 00:52:16,720
 it has to go through a projector gate,

1124
00:52:16,720 --> 00:52:18,320
 obviously reels of film, you know,

1125
00:52:18,320 --> 00:52:19,520
 balanced on a projector,

1126
00:52:19,520 --> 00:52:21,840
 pushing it through the projector's gate creates friction.

1127
00:52:21,840 --> 00:52:22,800
 Guess what that does?

1128
00:52:22,800 --> 00:52:24,400
 Frequently sets it on fire.

1129
00:52:24,400 --> 00:52:28,080
 And also, the substance it's made of, "Nitrate" film,

1130
00:52:28,080 --> 00:52:31,120
 it produces more oxygen as it burns,

1131
00:52:31,120 --> 00:52:33,440
 which adds to the flame.

1132
00:52:33,440 --> 00:52:35,680
 It can keep burning even if you put it underwater.

1133
00:52:35,680 --> 00:52:39,680
 It's staggering that any of this stuff

1134
00:52:39,680 --> 00:52:40,880
 is even left on the planet.

1135
00:52:40,880 --> 00:52:42,000
 It's so unstable.

1136
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:44,160
 It just doesn't want to exist in a stable form.

1137
00:52:44,160 --> 00:52:47,760
 - So one movie that was destroyed in the 1920s

1138
00:52:47,760 --> 00:52:49,280
 was a movie called "Humorisk,"

1139
00:52:49,280 --> 00:52:51,840
 which was a movie that was the only silent movie

1140
00:52:51,840 --> 00:52:52,800
 of the Marx brothers.

1141
00:52:52,800 --> 00:52:54,960
 And this is before they went into talkies themselves.

1142
00:52:54,960 --> 00:52:57,200
 And it was destroyed on purpose

1143
00:52:57,200 --> 00:52:59,760
 because Groucho Marx hated it so much

1144
00:52:59,760 --> 00:53:02,400
 that he bought up the film and he burnt it

1145
00:53:02,400 --> 00:53:03,760
 so that no one could ever see it again.

1146
00:53:03,760 --> 00:53:06,640
 And you always hear of artists who dream of that scenario,

1147
00:53:06,640 --> 00:53:09,760
 being able to go and remove from the shelves.

1148
00:53:09,760 --> 00:53:12,080
 George Lucas did a Christmas special for "Star Wars."

1149
00:53:12,080 --> 00:53:14,960
 His dream is to sledgehammer every single copy

1150
00:53:14,960 --> 00:53:16,560
 out of existence, and no one can.

1151
00:53:16,560 --> 00:53:18,240
 But Groucho Marx managed it.

1152
00:53:18,240 --> 00:53:20,240
 - He got rid of history. - That's amazing.

1153
00:53:20,240 --> 00:53:20,880
 Wow.

1154
00:53:20,880 --> 00:53:23,040
 That's like, I mean, this is off topic.

1155
00:53:23,040 --> 00:53:24,560
 We're just thinking of people who hate the film,

1156
00:53:24,560 --> 00:53:26,240
 say, produced and wish they were destroyed.

1157
00:53:26,240 --> 00:53:28,000
 I remember reading an interview with Patrick Stewart

1158
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:30,880
 who said that his biggest regret was doing a film

1159
00:53:30,880 --> 00:53:32,720
 called "Wild Geese 2."

1160
00:53:32,720 --> 00:53:34,800
 And he said the only reason he took the role

1161
00:53:34,800 --> 00:53:36,880
 is because he was offered the exact same amount of money

1162
00:53:36,880 --> 00:53:39,680
 for it as a repair for a window in his house

1163
00:53:39,680 --> 00:53:40,960
 had just been quoted.

1164
00:53:40,960 --> 00:53:42,880
 I don't know what kind of windows he's got.

1165
00:53:42,880 --> 00:53:44,320
 - Nice windows. - Yeah.

1166
00:53:46,080 --> 00:53:48,480
 Oh, my God. The guy who was his glazier

1167
00:53:48,480 --> 00:53:50,400
 must have been just like Steven Spielberg

1168
00:53:50,400 --> 00:53:52,560
 in a mustache or something that he's like, "Yeah."

1169
00:53:52,560 --> 00:53:53,920
 Yeah.

1170
00:53:53,920 --> 00:53:56,800
 This will cost you $13.6 million.

1171
00:53:56,800 --> 00:54:02,800
 Do you guys know when the last silent movie star died?

1172
00:54:02,800 --> 00:54:06,080
 Well, how do we define silent movie star?

1173
00:54:06,080 --> 00:54:07,920
 Because, for instance, the guy and the artist,

1174
00:54:07,920 --> 00:54:09,280
 that was a silent movie, wasn't it?

1175
00:54:09,280 --> 00:54:12,800
 Oh, I'm not counting Jean Dujard down as a silent movie star.

1176
00:54:12,800 --> 00:54:13,520
 No way.

1177
00:54:13,520 --> 00:54:16,320
 Sorry. Last person from the original silent movie.

1178
00:54:16,320 --> 00:54:17,200
 Who was enlightened to them?

1179
00:54:17,200 --> 00:54:18,800
 I would have said they were probably...

1180
00:54:18,800 --> 00:54:20,880
 They became talkies in the '20s, didn't they?

1181
00:54:20,880 --> 00:54:22,000
 Is that one of that?

1182
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:25,840
 So, let's say someone was 10 when that came out

1183
00:54:25,840 --> 00:54:27,840
 and they died when they were 100.

1184
00:54:27,840 --> 00:54:30,240
 - Then I was... - Yeah, possibly a couple of years ago.

1185
00:54:30,240 --> 00:54:30,960
 Yeah.

1186
00:54:30,960 --> 00:54:34,800
 Yeah, I'm going to say there was a kid

1187
00:54:34,800 --> 00:54:38,080
 who played the kid in the movie "The Kid."

1188
00:54:38,080 --> 00:54:42,560
 No, but did you not see the prequel to that?

1189
00:54:42,560 --> 00:54:43,200
 "The Fetus."

1190
00:54:43,200 --> 00:54:47,680
 Lon Chaney played "The Fetus," I believe.

1191
00:54:47,680 --> 00:54:51,920
 Yeah, he built himself an entire womb.

1192
00:54:51,920 --> 00:54:54,320
 Amazing.

1193
00:54:54,320 --> 00:54:56,880
 But Jackie Coogan was in that movie, "The Kid,"

1194
00:54:56,880 --> 00:54:59,440
 and I'm going to say him.

1195
00:54:59,440 --> 00:55:01,760
 He was uncle Fester in the Adams family as well.

1196
00:55:01,760 --> 00:55:03,040
 He died in the '80s.

1197
00:55:03,040 --> 00:55:06,080
 Okay. So, all right.

1198
00:55:06,080 --> 00:55:08,480
 So, James and Anna are saying the last couple of years,

1199
00:55:08,480 --> 00:55:10,000
 and you're saying the '80s, don't you?

1200
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:11,680
 James and Anna are closer. It's 2020.

1201
00:55:12,640 --> 00:55:17,040
 "Baby Peggy" was her name, not her forever.

1202
00:55:17,040 --> 00:55:19,040
 She had lost the baby element.

1203
00:55:19,040 --> 00:55:20,160
 Actually, she had lost the Peggy element.

1204
00:55:20,160 --> 00:55:20,880
 She changed her name.

1205
00:55:20,880 --> 00:55:23,600
 But she was so famous.

1206
00:55:23,600 --> 00:55:26,160
 She was one of the highest-paid movie stars in the entire 1920s,

1207
00:55:26,160 --> 00:55:28,400
 which was a gold rush time in Hollywood.

1208
00:55:28,400 --> 00:55:29,920
 She was so famous, she was the mascot

1209
00:55:29,920 --> 00:55:33,920
 of the 1924 Democratic Convention in New York.

1210
00:55:33,920 --> 00:55:34,480
 Wow.

1211
00:55:34,480 --> 00:55:36,240
 She turned up on stage next to...

1212
00:55:36,240 --> 00:55:37,680
 Not sure who it was. Ruth fell to someone.

1213
00:55:37,680 --> 00:55:41,200
 And that was back in the days of silent conventions, wasn't it?

1214
00:55:41,200 --> 00:55:44,720
 Yeah. Oh, for those days again.

1215
00:55:44,720 --> 00:55:49,600
 The last adult man to be in a silent movie

1216
00:55:49,600 --> 00:55:50,800
 was a guy called Shep Horton.

1217
00:55:50,800 --> 00:55:52,560
 And he only died in 2017.

1218
00:55:52,560 --> 00:55:54,000
 And he was in silent movies.

1219
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:55,120
 Shep Horton.

1220
00:55:55,120 --> 00:55:55,840
 Shep Horton.

1221
00:55:55,840 --> 00:55:57,520
 Yeah, H-O-U-G-H.

1222
00:55:57,520 --> 00:56:00,480
 But he was called "The Last of the Great Nobodies".

1223
00:56:00,480 --> 00:56:03,360
 Incredible.

1224
00:56:03,360 --> 00:56:05,360
 So, he was in hundreds of films.

1225
00:56:05,360 --> 00:56:07,280
 He was in "Gone with the Wind", "The Big Sleep",

1226
00:56:07,280 --> 00:56:08,640
 "Cleopatra", "Wizard of Oz",

1227
00:56:08,640 --> 00:56:11,360
 but always just as a kind of handsome dude

1228
00:56:11,360 --> 00:56:12,080
 in the background.

1229
00:56:12,080 --> 00:56:14,640
 But you can see him in all of these films.

1230
00:56:14,640 --> 00:56:16,080
 They've tracked loads of the movies he's in.

1231
00:56:16,080 --> 00:56:17,440
 He was in a dozen films a month.

1232
00:56:17,440 --> 00:56:19,600
 I know.

1233
00:56:19,600 --> 00:56:21,280
 You feel like he definitely, when he...

1234
00:56:21,280 --> 00:56:22,160
 That was on his CV.

1235
00:56:22,160 --> 00:56:24,000
 He coughed over the last word, didn't he?

1236
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:28,400
 I'd say, "Well, they called me The Last of the Great Nobodies".

1237
00:56:28,400 --> 00:56:33,360
 But after he died, they put his gravestone

1238
00:56:33,360 --> 00:56:35,680
 in a pile of other gravestone of "Nobody's".

1239
00:56:36,480 --> 00:56:37,040
 Hi.

1240
00:56:37,040 --> 00:56:41,120
 Okay, that's it.

1241
00:56:41,120 --> 00:56:42,160
