00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:19.600
 Hello and welcome to another episode of No Such Thing as a Fish, a weekly podcast coming to

00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:25.200
 you from four undisclosed locations in the UK. My name is Dan Schreiber, I am sitting here with

00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:30.240
 Anna Tyshinski, James Harkin and Andrew Hunter Murray and once again we have gathered round our

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:35.040
 microphones with our four favourite facts from the last seven days and in no particular order,

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:43.280
 here we go. Starting with you, Anna. My fact this week is that in 2016 Tupperware claimed to be

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:53.600
 holding a party summer in the world every 1.3 seconds. Bullshit! No! How's that possible?

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:59.760
 You're just not being invited and I know this is awkward. This is Tupperware parties. The reason

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:03.680
 I'm researching this is because I was talking to my mum a couple of weeks ago and she said,

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:07.520
 "I wonder if anyone goes to Tupperware parties anymore?" And I said, "What on earth are you

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:12.400
 talking about?" And then she was saying about, you know, how in their youths you'd have Tupperware

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:19.360
 parties and they are a thing where a Tupperware salesperson, sales rep, basically throws a house

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:24.480
 party where they demonstrate and display all sorts of Tupperware and it's still really popular

00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:29.920
 around the world. So they stopped happening in the UK in 2003, but they happen in lots of other

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:35.440
 countries still. Every 1.3 seconds you could be at one. They make extraordinary claims. So they

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:39.440
 claim that France has half a million Tupperware parties every year, which how many people go to

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:46.720
 a Tupperware party would you say? Is it 10? Yeah, 8 to 10. These days none. Like it must have been

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:52.560
 a bad year for Tupperware sales last year. Okay, so France has half a million Tupperware parties

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:57.280
 each with, let's say, 10 people attending. That's still 5 million French people. No, it isn't.

00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:00.880
 You're not saying that you only go to one Tupperware party every year and it's like, "Nope,

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:05.440
 that's my fill for the year." These Tupperware enthusiasts are going to more than one party.

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:10.080
 That's true. And also there are Tupperware raves, which can get really out of control quite a

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:16.160
 little. They're illegal at the moment, but... You have to bring your drugs in a totally sized Tupperware

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:21.920
 labelled. It is amazing the Tupperware story. So as you said, that's how they actually sell

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:27.120
 Tupperware and it started off not being very successful. So it was invented by Earl Tupper,

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:34.720
 not an Earl. That's just his name. I think it was 1946 and didn't sell very well. And then this

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:41.520
 woman called Brownie Wise came along with a wise attitude towards PR. And she was already selling

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:46.560
 various household goods via the house party. And she bought up some Tupperware, sold it,

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:52.400
 and he spotted that she was causing a massive increase in sales this way. And I think within

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:58.160
 three years of her being on the scene, he took all his products off shelves and sold them exclusively

00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:03.040
 at parties. And five years after she came on the scene, the company was making $100 million

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:10.000
 in sales per year. Wow. She absolutely smashed it. Yeah. She found out that whenever you put like

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:14.400
 some gravy in a Tupperware box and threw it across the room, she always got way more sales.

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:19.360
 That was the pièce de résistance, wasn't it? Bouncing the Tupperware across the room.

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:24.480
 The gravy frisbee. It's mad as well, isn't it, that this feels like, again, there's probably

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:28.320
 other research to suggest otherwise. But to me, it feels like this is the moment where we accepted

00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:32.720
 plastic into the house. So that's what they were fighting against, largely. Plastic wasn't a thing

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:37.760
 that you brought into the house. And a lot of people were very resistant to it. So it's so odd

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:42.320
 to know that in my head, at least, this is the moment where all of this now, all the plastic in

00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:45.760
 our house is off the back of these parties that were happening with Brownie Wise in America.

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:47.120
 Interesting idea. I like that.

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:49.920
 Diane lives in a child's Wendy house, we should say at this point.

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:53.440
 He's got his little cozy coupe car in the corner.

00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:59.200
 Speaking of the actual Tupperware parties, have you heard of the parties they used to have at

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:05.680
 Tupperware HQ? No, that sounded wild. So these, again, were Brownie Wise's idea. It was called

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:10.240
 Homecoming Jubilee. And it was for hundreds of the Tupperware sales women who were, I think

00:04:10.240 --> 00:04:15.200
 they were exclusively women who were selling the products in the home. So they had these, like,

00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:18.800
 mad, orgiastic, not quite orgiastic, but they were pretty funky.

00:04:18.800 --> 00:04:26.560
 And they were so far from orgiastic. No, no, no, no. What about this? 1954's big Tupperware rave

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:31.920
 was called a big dig. A big what? Sorry. A big dig. All right. So did it.

00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:40.880
 She buried $50,000 worth of minx dolls, diamond rings, gold watches, and tiny model cars around

00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:45.280
 the place at Tupperware HQ. And you had to go and dig them up. And if you found a tiny model car,

00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:51.920
 you could swap it for an actual car. I mean, it sounds insane. And they had Methodist preachers

00:04:51.920 --> 00:04:56.320
 come and say that Tupperware was a way of fighting communism. They had a Walk of Fame,

00:04:56.320 --> 00:05:02.400
 which was just Tupperware sales women on the Walk of Fame. They had a 40 foot mural called

00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:06.480
 the Museum of Dishes. They had a pond where apparently she baptized people.

00:05:06.480 --> 00:05:10.880
 Yeah, I haven't been exactly clear on why she was baptising people.

00:05:10.880 --> 00:05:16.480
 They did. They did say, though, that Brownie Wise had a sort of religious aura to her, didn't she?

00:05:16.480 --> 00:05:21.680
 She sort of was treated as a sort of high priest of the Tupperware religion at that time.

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:29.920
 And she used to go around with the original slag, polyethylene slag that Earl Tupper had used,

00:05:29.920 --> 00:05:34.720
 and she would allow people to stroke it and touch the slag, the sacred slag.

00:05:34.720 --> 00:05:38.240
 I said it was orgiastic. And if you're touching the sacred slag,

00:05:38.240 --> 00:05:41.520
 Brian, you should say what slag is. Yeah.

00:05:41.520 --> 00:05:49.600
 Well, it's polyethylene, isn't it? It's like a plastic, it's like a black plastic mold.

00:05:50.400 --> 00:05:53.920
 It's the plastic which the Tupperware was eventually made out of.

00:05:53.920 --> 00:05:59.440
 So he was given one of these big lumps of cast-off plastic from another company,

00:05:59.440 --> 00:06:04.560
 and he used a process to turn it into this kind of see-through plastic container thing.

00:06:04.560 --> 00:06:09.360
 And he kept the original version of it and then gave it to Brownie Wise, didn't he?

00:06:09.360 --> 00:06:10.160
 So cool.

00:06:10.160 --> 00:06:14.400
 And she said, just get your fingers on it, wish for what you want,

00:06:14.400 --> 00:06:19.600
 know it's going to come true, and then get out and work like everything, and it will.

00:06:20.240 --> 00:06:23.440
 It is starting to sound more and more orgiastic, some of this language.

00:06:23.440 --> 00:06:24.240
 Sort of it.

00:06:24.240 --> 00:06:26.560
 They had a wishing well at company headquarters.

00:06:26.560 --> 00:06:28.640
 That's sort of what you were saying, James, about the wishes.

00:06:28.640 --> 00:06:31.040
 They had a wishing well, and that's the point,

00:06:31.040 --> 00:06:33.440
 you throw wishes into the wishing well, don't you, if there is a wishing well.

00:06:33.440 --> 00:06:38.080
 And they got a wish fairy to come and dole out expensive gifts to the Tupperware ladies.

00:06:38.080 --> 00:06:38.960
 Did she live in the well?

00:06:38.960 --> 00:06:44.640
 It's unclear. I guess she lived in some Tupperware somewhere.

00:06:44.640 --> 00:06:46.480
 That would be cool.

00:06:46.480 --> 00:06:49.040
 Do you know the thing of someone bursting out of a cake?

00:06:49.600 --> 00:06:50.320
 Yeah.

00:06:50.320 --> 00:06:52.960
 They must have had someone bursting out of some Tupperware at one of these parties.

00:06:52.960 --> 00:06:55.520
 I doubt it, because I think the whole point of Tupperware is that it doesn't

00:06:55.520 --> 00:06:57.840
 open without quite a lot of force.

00:06:57.840 --> 00:07:02.240
 So you just basically got some asphyxiated woman in a plastic container.

00:07:02.240 --> 00:07:05.600
 That's a good advert, though.

00:07:05.600 --> 00:07:09.360
 I mean, it's so secure that if your life depends on it, you can't escape.

00:07:09.360 --> 00:07:14.160
 One of the things they did just on that subject is they did something called carrot calling,

00:07:14.160 --> 00:07:18.720
 which what would happen is you'd go to your party and then you'd get some Tupperware,

00:07:18.720 --> 00:07:21.360
 and then you'd put some carrots in your Tupperware,

00:07:21.360 --> 00:07:24.560
 and then you'd put some just on the shelf wherever you keep it or in the fridge,

00:07:24.560 --> 00:07:26.480
 if you're a weirdo that keeps your carrots in the fridge.

00:07:26.480 --> 00:07:30.640
 And then they would say, OK, well, let's come back in a month's time

00:07:30.640 --> 00:07:33.360
 and see how the carrots look that were in your Tupperware

00:07:33.360 --> 00:07:36.720
 compared to the ones that are on your shelf or on your pantry, right?

00:07:36.720 --> 00:07:40.400
 And so that was not only a way of proving how good the Tupperware was,

00:07:40.400 --> 00:07:44.480
 but it was a way of making sure the same people came back to your party to buy more shit.

00:07:44.480 --> 00:07:45.840
 So it was pretty clever.

00:07:45.840 --> 00:07:47.920
 That's really clever.

00:07:48.800 --> 00:07:53.360
 Just one thing about Tupperware that I found bizarre is that a third of its revenue comes

00:07:53.360 --> 00:08:00.160
 from makeup sales. Tupperware makeup. And in fact, in South America, it's more than half.

00:08:00.160 --> 00:08:05.600
 In Uruguay, 70%. And I could go on.

00:08:05.600 --> 00:08:07.120
 In parts of Uruguay, 90%.

00:08:07.120 --> 00:08:13.520
 There's one house in Uruguay, which is 100% Tupperware makeup.

00:08:13.520 --> 00:08:16.400
 What is the makeup? Is it a famous brand?

00:08:17.360 --> 00:08:20.320
 So they bought up a bunch of beauty brands in the early 2000s.

00:08:20.320 --> 00:08:22.800
 And this is when the guy who was running the company at the time,

00:08:22.800 --> 00:08:27.200
 I think it was a guy called Rick Goings, he realized that in South America,

00:08:27.200 --> 00:08:31.680
 he ran some stats and realized that people spent much more on makeup than they did on food containers.

00:08:31.680 --> 00:08:35.200
 He said that he checked something called the Vanity Index.

00:08:35.200 --> 00:08:39.760
 And South American countries rate most highly in terms of people who care most about their appearance.

00:08:39.760 --> 00:08:43.520
 And so they launched makeup there instead. And it's super popular.

00:08:43.520 --> 00:08:47.200
 I suppose like you would have Avon parties in the UK, wouldn't you?

00:08:47.200 --> 00:08:49.360
 Like who would sell makeup and stuff like that.

00:08:49.360 --> 00:08:54.000
 And Sommers parties, I think used to be a thing.

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:57.040
 Yeah, definitely a thing, wasn't they?

00:08:57.040 --> 00:09:01.920
 I think there was an article which claimed that there were 4,000 and Sommers parties every week.

00:09:01.920 --> 00:09:02.960
 Every second.

00:09:02.960 --> 00:09:10.560
 They had a falling out, didn't they, in the end, Earl and Brownie.

00:09:10.560 --> 00:09:12.240
 The two combined geniuses.

00:09:12.240 --> 00:09:15.520
 So Earl was sort of the inventive genius and she was the PR genius.

00:09:15.520 --> 00:09:19.760
 And he thought that it should be more about Tupperware and less about her.

00:09:19.760 --> 00:09:21.280
 And it was becoming quite about her.

00:09:21.280 --> 00:09:24.240
 She was the first woman ever to appear on the cover of Business Week.

00:09:24.240 --> 00:09:27.520
 She, because of her fame as this Tupperware Queen,

00:09:27.520 --> 00:09:30.480
 she ended up writing this self-help book called Best Wishes.

00:09:30.480 --> 00:09:36.880
 And Earl Tupper eventually thought, no, she's becoming too self-involved and a hungry for fame.

00:09:36.880 --> 00:09:41.440
 And he fired her in 1958 and sold the company shortly afterwards.

00:09:41.440 --> 00:09:44.480
 I read, and I don't know, I think there's a lot of speculation

00:09:44.480 --> 00:09:46.880
 because we don't fully know the details of the falling out.

00:09:46.880 --> 00:09:50.480
 But there were a few rumours that he thought that once he passed away,

00:09:50.480 --> 00:09:54.480
 if the business went to Brownie, it would go down because no one would want

00:09:54.480 --> 00:09:58.080
 a woman at the head of a company, which sounds mad,

00:09:58.080 --> 00:10:00.800
 but apparently part of his thinking.

00:10:00.800 --> 00:10:02.240
 I mean, there's a lot of rumours.

00:10:02.240 --> 00:10:03.200
 It's very strange.

00:10:03.200 --> 00:10:11.840
 I read one that in 1957, she had held a massive Tupperware party on a Florida island for 1,200 people.

00:10:11.840 --> 00:10:16.480
 And there was a torrential thunderstorm which injured 21 people and that led to lots of lawsuits.

00:10:16.480 --> 00:10:22.320
 And so this is the most charitable explanation of why she was fired is that that was a big mistake.

00:10:22.320 --> 00:10:26.080
 But it does seem like it was quite a lot to do with Tupper's ego.

00:10:26.080 --> 00:10:31.680
 And in fact, there's more evidence because she used to bury things on Tupperware HQ property.

00:10:31.680 --> 00:10:38.400
 Once she had been sacked, he had a whole dug on Tupperware company property

00:10:38.400 --> 00:10:43.520
 and dumped 600 copies of her book into the hole and buried them.

00:10:43.520 --> 00:10:44.560
 Wow.

00:10:44.560 --> 00:10:47.760
 That wasn't so he could throw a big party where people got to dig on her book.

00:10:47.760 --> 00:10:50.640
 It was not.

00:10:50.640 --> 00:10:53.120
 Did he put it in Tupperware or is it just into the ground?

00:10:53.120 --> 00:10:56.240
 I think the point was not to preserve the copies of the book for future generations.

00:10:56.240 --> 00:10:59.760
 I was just thinking he would have shot himself in the foot there with that idea.

00:10:59.760 --> 00:11:01.600
 He did go a bit strange afterwards, didn't he?

00:11:01.600 --> 00:11:04.000
 He, what did he do?

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:06.400
 He moved to Costa Rica.

00:11:06.400 --> 00:11:08.720
 He basically sold the company, got a whole load of money.

00:11:08.720 --> 00:11:10.000
 He didn't want it to get taxed.

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:15.760
 And so divorced his wife and went to live in Costa Rica and so he did.

00:11:15.760 --> 00:11:19.760
 Although before that he bought an island, which I think he wanted to live on.

00:11:19.760 --> 00:11:22.640
 He bought this island called San Jose Island, which I'd never heard of.

00:11:22.640 --> 00:11:24.400
 It's just off the coast of Panama.

00:11:24.400 --> 00:11:27.760
 And he wanted it to become a holiday resort.

00:11:27.760 --> 00:11:29.520
 And that makes him sound very Richard Branson,

00:11:29.520 --> 00:11:32.720
 but I think it was an island that didn't really have people on it

00:11:32.720 --> 00:11:34.720
 and probably didn't cost a huge amount.

00:11:34.720 --> 00:11:36.720
 And so he wanted it to be this glorious resort.

00:11:36.720 --> 00:11:37.520
 And it looks stunning.

00:11:37.520 --> 00:11:40.080
 And I've seen pictures, golden sand beaches.

00:11:40.080 --> 00:11:44.800
 He hadn't investigated it enough because it had been the site of massive chemical weapons testing

00:11:44.800 --> 00:11:48.240
 and dumps by the US, Canada and Britain in the 1940s.

00:11:48.240 --> 00:11:50.800
 So he sent a couple of staff there.

00:11:50.800 --> 00:11:53.440
 They got quite badly burned and damaged from that.

00:11:53.440 --> 00:11:55.440
 And they realized that it was uninhabitable.

00:11:55.440 --> 00:11:56.560
 That's bad luck.

00:11:56.560 --> 00:11:59.680
 He was an amazing ideas man from what I can tell.

00:11:59.680 --> 00:12:04.080
 There's a lot of inventions that he tried to make that never ended up being

00:12:04.080 --> 00:12:06.240
 realized, which I think is a bit of a shame.

00:12:06.240 --> 00:12:11.920
 He had the no drip ice cream cone, which that's a great idea, isn't it?

00:12:11.920 --> 00:12:13.040
 It's a great idea.

00:12:13.040 --> 00:12:13.360
 Yeah.

00:12:13.360 --> 00:12:16.160
 It's one of the only problem with ice cream cones, really.

00:12:16.160 --> 00:12:16.560
 Yeah.

00:12:16.560 --> 00:12:18.320
 Actually, you know what I would invent?

00:12:18.320 --> 00:12:21.360
 You know, the best thing about an ice cream cone is where you snap off the bottom

00:12:21.360 --> 00:12:24.800
 of the ice cream cone and you turn it into a tiny little ice cream,

00:12:24.800 --> 00:12:27.040
 tiny kind of microcosm of itself.

00:12:27.040 --> 00:12:28.560
 Do you know that?

00:12:28.560 --> 00:12:31.040
 So you snap off the bottom of an ice cream cone.

00:12:31.040 --> 00:12:33.200
 So you have a tiny little bit of cone.

00:12:33.200 --> 00:12:36.000
 And then you take a tiny little bit of ice cream from the top of it.

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:39.760
 And it can be like you're a giant because you have a tiny ice cream.

00:12:39.760 --> 00:12:43.280
 Well, you could resell it to other kids around you and make back your money.

00:12:43.280 --> 00:12:47.280
 But then I would invent one where they kept re-growing the bottom

00:12:47.280 --> 00:12:49.040
 so you could do that an infinite amount of time.

00:12:49.040 --> 00:12:51.120
 That's weird because I do.

00:12:51.120 --> 00:12:52.800
 So do you not do the thing where you snap off the bottom

00:12:52.800 --> 00:12:54.400
 and then you suck the ice cream out through the tube?

00:12:54.400 --> 00:12:55.120
 That's what I do.

00:12:55.120 --> 00:12:58.240
 Ah, well, you could do both of those things if you, you know.

00:12:58.240 --> 00:12:59.040
 Yeah.

00:12:59.040 --> 00:12:59.520
 Yeah.

00:12:59.520 --> 00:13:00.960
 You're all mad in different ways.

00:13:00.960 --> 00:13:03.200
 These are not acceptable ways to get.

00:13:03.200 --> 00:13:06.640
 As he stands next to the ice cream van and tells the children

00:13:06.640 --> 00:13:08.560
 what they're allowed to do and what they're not allowed to do.

00:13:08.560 --> 00:13:12.960
 I've got my tray in front of me to catch any spare drops.

00:13:12.960 --> 00:13:16.800
 You thought the ice cream van man was scary.

00:13:16.800 --> 00:13:20.080
 How about the creepy guy standing next to me catching our droplets?

00:13:20.080 --> 00:13:26.320
 A couple of other inventions by Earl Tupper.

00:13:26.320 --> 00:13:30.880
 Fishing poles that wade your catch as you were reeling it in.

00:13:31.200 --> 00:13:31.840
 Great idea.

00:13:31.840 --> 00:13:35.120
 He invented a machine to make it easier to clean and dress chickens.

00:13:35.120 --> 00:13:37.200
 And dress.

00:13:37.200 --> 00:13:41.280
 I imagine dress as in for cooking, not as in putting trousers on them or something.

00:13:41.280 --> 00:13:44.320
 Andy, did you read this one?

00:13:44.320 --> 00:13:46.160
 Because I can't, I can't work out what it would be.

00:13:46.160 --> 00:13:47.440
 A fish powered boat.

00:13:47.440 --> 00:13:49.120
 I didn't read that.

00:13:49.120 --> 00:13:52.080
 That was one where the idea is you get a really big fish

00:13:52.080 --> 00:13:55.040
 and you attach it to the bottom of your boat.

00:13:55.040 --> 00:13:59.600
 And then the fish swims along the river and just pulls your boat along with it.

00:13:59.600 --> 00:14:01.920
 The boat is directly above the fish.

00:14:01.920 --> 00:14:02.560
 Yeah, yeah.

00:14:02.560 --> 00:14:03.600
 Is that real?

00:14:03.600 --> 00:14:04.800
 Well, just one fish.

00:14:04.800 --> 00:14:06.000
 None of these are really real.

00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:06.640
 A lot of them.

00:14:06.640 --> 00:14:08.480
 I wonder if the concept was real, right?

00:14:08.480 --> 00:14:08.880
 Sure.

00:14:08.880 --> 00:14:13.440
 I mean, they were written in like his notebooks from when he was a teenager.

00:14:13.440 --> 00:14:14.000
 Some of these.

00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:17.760
 So I think they were, oh, I mean, they were ideas.

00:14:17.760 --> 00:14:21.200
 But I don't think he ever really thought that we were going to take a load of boats

00:14:21.200 --> 00:14:22.800
 and attach fish to the bottom of them.

00:14:22.800 --> 00:14:27.760
 This, that could be the green energy solution that we're all looking for.

00:14:27.760 --> 00:14:28.240
 It could be.

00:14:28.240 --> 00:14:29.280
 That's what we want to do.

00:14:29.280 --> 00:14:31.440
 Like stress the fish out a bit more.

00:14:31.440 --> 00:14:31.600
 Yeah.

00:14:31.600 --> 00:14:35.520
 It makes sense, though, the invention of a fish weighing rod,

00:14:35.520 --> 00:14:37.680
 because you need to make sure you're really in a big fish

00:14:37.680 --> 00:14:40.080
 if it's planning to drag your ferry over the tunnel.

00:14:40.080 --> 00:14:50.480
 OK, it is time for fact number two, and that is Andy.

00:14:50.480 --> 00:14:55.360
 My fact is that in 1868, there were five different plays on in London's West End

00:14:55.360 --> 00:14:59.760
 simultaneously where a train burst onto the stage and threatened to run somebody over.

00:14:59.760 --> 00:15:04.800
 This was an huge theatrical trend.

00:15:04.800 --> 00:15:05.840
 So I've got the names of the plays.

00:15:05.840 --> 00:15:08.320
 They were called Land Rats and Water Rats.

00:15:08.320 --> 00:15:08.960
 That's one play.

00:15:08.960 --> 00:15:15.360
 Rail, River and Road, Danger, After Dark, and my favorite, The Scamps of London.

00:15:15.360 --> 00:15:16.640
 Great sounding play.

00:15:16.640 --> 00:15:22.560
 And in all of these plays, there was a train drama scene where a train burst on.

00:15:22.560 --> 00:15:27.680
 And the trains were obviously, you know, quite detailed wooden flats that were mounted on rails.

00:15:27.680 --> 00:15:30.720
 So they did they were able to burst onto the stage.

00:15:30.720 --> 00:15:34.640
 Lots of kind of sound effects and smoke and stuff.

00:15:34.640 --> 00:15:36.480
 Yeah, exactly.

00:15:36.480 --> 00:15:38.800
 And this was a massive thing.

00:15:38.800 --> 00:15:41.840
 And I think it was because of a play the previous year called Under the Gaslight.

00:15:41.840 --> 00:15:46.160
 Although it was in that was the first time it was really big on stage.

00:15:46.160 --> 00:15:48.160
 The guy who wrote it, he was called Augustine Daly.

00:15:48.160 --> 00:15:50.400
 And he claimed that other people had nicked his idea.

00:15:50.400 --> 00:15:52.800
 And then other people said, no, you nicked this from somewhere.

00:15:52.800 --> 00:15:56.160
 Well, he was he won the court case.

00:15:56.160 --> 00:16:00.000
 So I think technically we have to say that it was his idea.

00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:01.760
 He's not going to say.

00:16:01.760 --> 00:16:08.400
 He claimed that he was just walking down the road and he tripped up over like a piece of,

00:16:08.400 --> 00:16:09.920
 you know, pavements or something.

00:16:09.920 --> 00:16:12.480
 And he hurt his toe and had to hop all the way home.

00:16:12.480 --> 00:16:17.120
 And when he landed back in his bed, it just appeared to him the idea from nowhere.

00:16:17.120 --> 00:16:20.320
 As opposed to the fact that there was actually already an idea out there.

00:16:20.320 --> 00:16:21.920
 Yeah, the weirdest.

00:16:21.920 --> 00:16:26.000
 We actually have his first hand quotes from that moment.

00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:27.680
 And it breeds so bizarre.

00:16:27.680 --> 00:16:31.440
 He says, I was near my door and I rushed into the house, threw myself into a chair,

00:16:31.440 --> 00:16:34.320
 grasping my injured foot with both hands for the pain was great.

00:16:34.320 --> 00:16:36.800
 And exclaiming over and over again, I've got it.

00:16:36.800 --> 00:16:37.520
 I've got it.

00:16:37.520 --> 00:16:39.680
 And it beats hot irons all to pieces.

00:16:39.680 --> 00:16:42.480
 It's like, we should say this.

00:16:42.480 --> 00:16:45.280
 Sorry, the idea that we're talking about is not the train crashing through though.

00:16:45.280 --> 00:16:47.040
 It's the person tied to a railway.

00:16:47.040 --> 00:16:47.440
 I did.

00:16:47.440 --> 00:16:51.600
 So this was a meme in 1867,

00:16:51.600 --> 00:16:56.000
 which began with this under the gaslight play where someone's tied to a train track

00:16:56.000 --> 00:16:58.480
 and a train's coming towards them at the very last minute.

00:16:58.480 --> 00:16:59.600
 You whip them away.

00:16:59.600 --> 00:17:01.600
 And that was his genius idea, right?

00:17:01.600 --> 00:17:04.320
 By the way, the stubbing his toe had nothing to do with it.

00:17:04.320 --> 00:17:05.040
 It's bizarre.

00:17:05.040 --> 00:17:07.200
 He just happened to stub his toe at the same time.

00:17:07.200 --> 00:17:08.320
 The idea.

00:17:08.320 --> 00:17:13.920
 But this play was held at the Worrell Sisters New York City Theatre in 1867

00:17:13.920 --> 00:17:15.760
 and was absolutely massive.

00:17:16.640 --> 00:17:20.480
 And it wasn't actually these days, I would say we would see that meme.

00:17:20.480 --> 00:17:25.040
 And it would be like a damsel in distress who was tied to the rail tracks.

00:17:25.040 --> 00:17:29.680
 And then some mustachioed hero would come and save the day.

00:17:29.680 --> 00:17:33.120
 But in this case, it was actually the woman who saved the man.

00:17:33.120 --> 00:17:35.840
 There was a man in the play called Snorky.

00:17:35.840 --> 00:17:39.440
 And he was tied to the train tracks.

00:17:39.440 --> 00:17:43.360
 And then the woman protagonist would come and save the day.

00:17:43.360 --> 00:17:45.200
 And then Snorky would exclaim,

00:17:45.200 --> 00:17:47.840
 "These are the women who ain't to have a vote."

00:17:47.840 --> 00:17:49.600
 Oh, really?

00:17:49.600 --> 00:17:50.320
 Political.

00:17:50.320 --> 00:17:52.480
 So it's quite a political little thing.

00:17:52.480 --> 00:17:56.240
 But the play was run by these sisters called the Worrell Sisters.

00:17:56.240 --> 00:17:58.240
 And they were massive.

00:17:58.240 --> 00:18:02.800
 They were the daughters of a clown and kind of grew up in the showbiz.

00:18:02.800 --> 00:18:06.960
 And they kind of started doing these burlesque acts

00:18:06.960 --> 00:18:09.920
 where they would take the piss out of other plays and stuff like that.

00:18:09.920 --> 00:18:14.400
 And then eventually they did so well that they managed to buy their own theatre in New York City.

00:18:14.400 --> 00:18:16.080
 And that was where they put on this play.

00:18:16.080 --> 00:18:19.280
 And the most famous one of them was Jenny Worrell.

00:18:19.280 --> 00:18:21.360
 And it was written of her that,

00:18:21.360 --> 00:18:23.920
 "The beautiful voluptuous Jenny Worrell,

00:18:23.920 --> 00:18:28.880
 subtlete, drank champagne, owned fast horses, wore diamonds,

00:18:28.880 --> 00:18:33.040
 squandered money to left and right until the public grew weary of her."

00:18:33.040 --> 00:18:36.080
 So and then she died in poverty in the end.

00:18:36.080 --> 00:18:37.360
 So it's not a fun story.

00:18:37.360 --> 00:18:39.600
 But unfortunately, she was also the daughter of a clown.

00:18:39.600 --> 00:18:44.080
 So she had size 64 shoes and that made it very hard to socialise.

00:18:44.080 --> 00:18:45.760
 I do think when Snorky says,

00:18:45.760 --> 00:18:47.520
 "And these are the women to wait to have a vote,"

00:18:47.520 --> 00:18:51.520
 it's slightly, like, did he believe in sufferage for women

00:18:51.520 --> 00:18:54.080
 before a woman saved him from a railway track?

00:18:54.080 --> 00:18:56.720
 Sometimes you need that moment of clarity,

00:18:56.720 --> 00:18:59.520
 like stubbing Yotto or being saved from a train.

00:18:59.520 --> 00:19:02.560
 I think no one should have the vote

00:19:02.560 --> 00:19:04.800
 unless they can prove that they've saved someone else's life.

00:19:04.800 --> 00:19:10.160
 It's quite similar to just in the case of it switching,

00:19:10.160 --> 00:19:12.240
 and it used to be a woman who saved a man,

00:19:12.240 --> 00:19:15.280
 the first known cliffhanger, literal cliffhanger,

00:19:15.280 --> 00:19:18.720
 was in Thomas Hardy's A Pair of Blue Eyes, wasn't it, in 1873.

00:19:18.720 --> 00:19:21.120
 And so this was really the age of the cliffhanger.

00:19:21.120 --> 00:19:23.040
 That's what that train scene is,

00:19:23.040 --> 00:19:25.360
 is because it's the very last minute when they escape.

00:19:25.360 --> 00:19:27.680
 Was this a novel, Anna, or did he write plays as well?

00:19:27.680 --> 00:19:29.840
 Yes, no, this was a novel, A Pair of Blue Eyes.

00:19:29.840 --> 00:19:31.920
 And it features Henry Knight, who's the hero,

00:19:31.920 --> 00:19:33.760
 and he's left dangling off the edge of a cliff.

00:19:33.760 --> 00:19:36.320
 And then the whole book is him dangling,

00:19:36.320 --> 00:19:39.280
 at which point he reviews the entire history of the world

00:19:39.280 --> 00:19:40.640
 whilst waiting to be rescued.

00:19:41.360 --> 00:19:42.720
 And that's the book.

00:19:42.720 --> 00:19:46.480
 And then at the end, I believe his love interest pops up,

00:19:46.480 --> 00:19:48.720
 and fashions are rope out of her own underwear

00:19:48.720 --> 00:19:50.080
 to haul him to safety.

00:19:50.080 --> 00:19:53.280
 Wow, luckily she just came back from a land summits party.

00:19:53.280 --> 00:19:57.920
 Yes, it was very flimsy, it snapped immediately,

00:19:57.920 --> 00:19:59.280
 and he died tragically.

00:19:59.280 --> 00:20:00.800
 I can't believe after all the crap we got

00:20:00.800 --> 00:20:03.840
 for ruining the ending of another classic literature novel

00:20:03.840 --> 00:20:07.040
 that you've gone ahead and spoiled the ending of this Hardy one.

00:20:07.040 --> 00:20:10.800
 Yeah, what was that, Anna Karenina?

00:20:10.800 --> 00:20:15.040
 Yeah, another book featuring, weirdly, a train which runs the road.

00:20:15.040 --> 00:20:16.400
 Oh, God, no, please.

00:20:16.400 --> 00:20:17.680
 I need to hear that episode.

00:20:17.680 --> 00:20:18.400
 Stop listening.

00:20:18.400 --> 00:20:23.520
 This sort of trend was Victorian melodrama, it gets called.

00:20:23.520 --> 00:20:25.360
 And it was a really big thing.

00:20:25.360 --> 00:20:28.880
 The idea was basically sensation.

00:20:28.880 --> 00:20:32.800
 You had huge theatres, often with three or 4,000 seats in them.

00:20:32.800 --> 00:20:35.280
 And so theatres were engaged in an arms race

00:20:35.280 --> 00:20:37.440
 to come up with the most sensational stuff.

00:20:37.440 --> 00:20:40.320
 And a lot of them were thanks to a guy called Bruce Sensation

00:20:40.320 --> 00:20:42.160
 Smith, have you heard of him?

00:20:42.160 --> 00:20:45.440
 He came up with loads of amazing theatrical gimmicks.

00:20:45.440 --> 00:20:48.880
 So one of them is of a diver descending into the sea.

00:20:48.880 --> 00:20:52.080
 So that's what's happening in the story.

00:20:52.080 --> 00:20:57.760
 But to show that, the boat he's in, that got lifted up into the flies.

00:20:57.760 --> 00:20:59.440
 So it looks like he's descending

00:20:59.440 --> 00:21:01.360
 because the boat is rising and rising above him.

00:21:01.360 --> 00:21:05.680
 But also then they revealed huge tanks of water behind him

00:21:05.680 --> 00:21:07.200
 which have real fish swimming in them.

00:21:07.840 --> 00:21:11.200
 So as he descends, you see he is surrounded by actual fish.

00:21:11.200 --> 00:21:12.320
 That's so cool.

00:21:12.320 --> 00:21:13.280
 That's very cool.

00:21:13.280 --> 00:21:16.160
 Not everyone was that happy with these sensational plays.

00:21:16.160 --> 00:21:20.160
 So W.S. Gilbert of Gilbert and Sullivan fame.

00:21:20.160 --> 00:21:22.400
 He said about these sensational plays,

00:21:22.400 --> 00:21:25.840
 "Every play which contains a house on fire, a sinking steamer,

00:21:25.840 --> 00:21:30.160
 or a railway accident will succeed in spite of itself.

00:21:30.160 --> 00:21:33.280
 In point of fact, nothing could wreck such a piece

00:21:33.280 --> 00:21:35.360
 except carefully written dialogue

00:21:35.360 --> 00:21:37.600
 or a strict attention to probability."

00:21:37.600 --> 00:21:41.760
 He said, "Avoid these two stumbling blocks

00:21:41.760 --> 00:21:43.760
 and your piece will succeed triumphantly."

00:21:43.760 --> 00:21:45.120
 Meow.

00:21:45.120 --> 00:21:45.600
 I know.

00:21:45.600 --> 00:21:47.040
 Ouch.

00:21:47.040 --> 00:21:48.480
 I think Dickens felt the same.

00:21:48.480 --> 00:21:53.120
 Again, I think people would go to see the melodramatic moment

00:21:53.120 --> 00:21:56.000
 rather than any plot or dialogue or acting, wouldn't they?

00:21:56.000 --> 00:21:58.480
 And Dickens said of a play called "The Streets of London"

00:21:58.480 --> 00:22:00.160
 which had a city burning down in it.

00:22:00.160 --> 00:22:02.320
 And the name would change depending on what city it was in.

00:22:02.320 --> 00:22:03.600
 So it would be "The Streets of Bolton"

00:22:03.600 --> 00:22:04.640
 when it went to Bolton.

00:22:04.640 --> 00:22:06.400
 "The Streets of Glasgow."

00:22:06.400 --> 00:22:07.760
 And Dickens said of it,

00:22:07.760 --> 00:22:10.640
 "It's the most depressing instance without exception

00:22:10.640 --> 00:22:13.840
 of an utterly degrading and debasing theatrical taste

00:22:13.840 --> 00:22:16.400
 that has ever come under my writhing notice."

00:22:16.400 --> 00:22:17.600
 Wow.

00:22:17.600 --> 00:22:18.800
 Well, that's extraordinary.

00:22:18.800 --> 00:22:21.520
 I guess it's just the equivalent of a blockbuster film though,

00:22:21.520 --> 00:22:24.640
 which you guys, you know, that there's an incredible scene

00:22:24.640 --> 00:22:26.480
 where a plane disassembles itself or whatever.

00:22:26.480 --> 00:22:29.360
 Yeah, it's a Dwayne Johnson movie, basically.

00:22:29.360 --> 00:22:31.520
 Yeah, it's a Michael Bay movie.

00:22:31.520 --> 00:22:32.480
 Yeah, I would have loved them.

00:22:32.480 --> 00:22:35.040
 Imagine what Dickens would have thought of "Transformers Fall."

00:22:35.040 --> 00:22:39.360
 There was like a response to it, wasn't there?

00:22:39.360 --> 00:22:41.440
 So in the 1850s and 1860s,

00:22:41.440 --> 00:22:43.360
 there's a guy called Tom Robertson

00:22:43.360 --> 00:22:46.080
 who invented a thing called "Cup and Source of Realism."

00:22:46.080 --> 00:22:49.280
 And what that was, it was the exact opposite

00:22:49.280 --> 00:22:52.160
 of these train crashes and fires and drownings

00:22:52.160 --> 00:22:52.960
 and stuff like that.

00:22:52.960 --> 00:22:57.360
 And this was reported as being really, really unusual.

00:22:57.360 --> 00:23:00.080
 If there were a few people talking in a kitchen, say,

00:23:00.080 --> 00:23:02.720
 Robertson would put on stage as many chairs

00:23:02.720 --> 00:23:06.000
 as would realistically be found in a kitchen or a dining room,

00:23:06.000 --> 00:23:08.400
 as opposed to everyone else who would say,

00:23:08.400 --> 00:23:11.280
 "Well, there are two people talking, so we only need two chairs."

00:23:11.280 --> 00:23:12.080
 So we'll just put that.

00:23:12.080 --> 00:23:14.560
 So he had everything that was really realistic.

00:23:14.560 --> 00:23:18.320
 And there was one where someone was making a pudding on stage.

00:23:18.320 --> 00:23:20.400
 And this was absolutely the talk of the town

00:23:20.400 --> 00:23:23.120
 because it was so unusual that someone would really be

00:23:23.120 --> 00:23:26.240
 actually making a pudding while they were doing the talking.

00:23:26.240 --> 00:23:30.080
 And instead of kind of projecting and really shouting

00:23:30.080 --> 00:23:32.640
 these kind of what was happening in the play,

00:23:32.640 --> 00:23:34.320
 they would just talk as a normal person.

00:23:34.320 --> 00:23:36.240
 And it was just like a realistic thing.

00:23:36.240 --> 00:23:38.160
 And to start off with, no one would put these plays on

00:23:38.160 --> 00:23:40.960
 because they were like, "Well, where's the fucking car crash?

00:23:40.960 --> 00:23:43.040
 Where's the train crash? We don't have it."

00:23:43.040 --> 00:23:46.080
 But eventually there was one or two theaters that did it.

00:23:46.080 --> 00:23:48.880
 And then that's kind of where we are today a little bit, isn't it?

00:23:48.880 --> 00:23:50.480
 Sort of, except the chair thing.

00:23:50.480 --> 00:23:53.120
 I think the chair thing is still doesn't happen.

00:23:53.120 --> 00:23:55.120
 And that is revolutionary.

00:23:55.120 --> 00:23:58.640
 You do not see spare chairs in plays and that's bullshit.

00:23:58.640 --> 00:23:59.680
 You're right.

00:23:59.680 --> 00:24:03.680
 I was reading up on sort of general theater stage props

00:24:03.680 --> 00:24:05.760
 off the back of this fact.

00:24:05.760 --> 00:24:07.760
 And so just a couple of things that I found.

00:24:07.760 --> 00:24:12.320
 There was a story of Orson Welles when he used to be performing

00:24:12.320 --> 00:24:13.760
 in Julius Caesar.

00:24:13.760 --> 00:24:16.960
 He played the role of Brutus.

00:24:16.960 --> 00:24:22.320
 And he preferred a real knife because a plastic knife

00:24:22.320 --> 00:24:25.520
 didn't really give the proper shine in the theater lights.

00:24:25.520 --> 00:24:28.320
 So when you have a real blade, it really bounces it off

00:24:28.320 --> 00:24:29.200
 and makes it look real.

00:24:29.200 --> 00:24:32.400
 Anyway, they had to take Julius Caesar to the hospital

00:24:32.400 --> 00:24:34.160
 because he was stabbed by Orson Welles.

00:24:34.160 --> 00:24:37.520
 He collapsed.

00:24:37.520 --> 00:24:38.160
 Yeah.

00:24:38.160 --> 00:24:41.040
 And yeah, the end of the scene he was taken to the hospital

00:24:41.040 --> 00:24:43.520
 where he had to recover for quite a long time.

00:24:43.520 --> 00:24:44.640
 At the end of the scene.

00:24:44.640 --> 00:24:48.320
 I would say bring the scene to a close a little bit early.

00:24:48.320 --> 00:24:50.880
 I think everyone's watching going,

00:24:50.880 --> 00:24:53.120
 bloody hell Julius Caesar is good in this, isn't he?

00:24:53.120 --> 00:24:57.200
 Wow.

00:24:57.200 --> 00:24:57.280
 Yeah.

00:24:57.280 --> 00:24:59.680
 But doesn't he get stabbed about 40 times in the...

00:24:59.680 --> 00:25:00.400
 Because it loads of people.

00:25:00.400 --> 00:25:01.760
 By lots of different people, though.

00:25:01.760 --> 00:25:04.400
 Presumably Orson Welles was the only one with a natural knife.

00:25:04.400 --> 00:25:07.200
 Everyone else was just doing the plastic thing.

00:25:07.200 --> 00:25:10.160
 Orson Welles was so devoted to his craft he handed out 40 knives

00:25:10.160 --> 00:25:12.720
 and he recruited his worst enemy to play Caesar.

00:25:12.720 --> 00:25:15.680
 Wow.

00:25:15.680 --> 00:25:18.400
 Speaking of that, there was a production of Dad's Army

00:25:18.400 --> 00:25:20.240
 in 2010 in South Wales.

00:25:20.400 --> 00:25:22.720
 Local production.

00:25:22.720 --> 00:25:24.880
 And they realised in a rehearsal that they were

00:25:24.880 --> 00:25:27.120
 accidentally using live grenades.

00:25:27.120 --> 00:25:29.440
 Which they have just found.

00:25:29.440 --> 00:25:30.080
 Don't panic.

00:25:30.080 --> 00:25:34.640
 And it was Corporal Jones who was the man who realised.

00:25:34.640 --> 00:25:35.280
 Oh my God.

00:25:35.280 --> 00:25:35.920
 Yeah, I know.

00:25:35.920 --> 00:25:36.080
 Absolutely.

00:25:36.080 --> 00:25:38.400
 And they realised as he was looking at it he thought,

00:25:38.400 --> 00:25:40.320
 "Oh, that's funny. This does look good, doesn't it?"

00:25:40.320 --> 00:25:42.080
 In fact, there's a pin still in it.

00:25:42.080 --> 00:25:47.520
 And they had found them in the garage of a cast member's father-in-law

00:25:47.520 --> 00:25:49.680
 and just driven them to the theatre rattling around.

00:25:49.680 --> 00:25:51.840
 And they had to call the bomb squad to come and blow them up.

00:25:51.840 --> 00:25:52.480
 Oh, wow.

00:25:52.480 --> 00:25:54.960
 You know what they do for drugs in films?

00:25:54.960 --> 00:25:58.080
 Because in some films they have to take lots of drugs.

00:25:58.080 --> 00:26:01.760
 Is it like a flour or icing sugar or something?

00:26:01.760 --> 00:26:02.240
 I would have thought.

00:26:02.240 --> 00:26:03.040
 Yeah, it's pretty close.

00:26:03.040 --> 00:26:05.040
 So Propmasters, basically the ones,

00:26:05.040 --> 00:26:07.120
 they have to test all the drugs themselves

00:26:07.120 --> 00:26:08.880
 to make sure that you can take it as an actor

00:26:08.880 --> 00:26:10.640
 and not immediately start choking or whatever.

00:26:10.640 --> 00:26:14.720
 So fake cocaine in the Wolf of Wall Street,

00:26:14.720 --> 00:26:17.120
 that I think was vitamin B powder.

00:26:17.120 --> 00:26:17.920
 And that was fine.

00:26:19.200 --> 00:26:22.640
 They use moss instead of marijuana in films, which...

00:26:22.640 --> 00:26:24.320
 Andy.

00:26:24.320 --> 00:26:26.560
 I imagine Andy going to his moss dealer

00:26:26.560 --> 00:26:28.480
 and accidentally getting some marijuana and going,

00:26:28.480 --> 00:26:29.520
 "What's this bullshit?"

00:26:29.520 --> 00:26:33.520
 I felt calmer and I wanted to feel tense.

00:26:33.520 --> 00:26:36.800
 Yeah, magic mushrooms are just mushrooms.

00:26:36.800 --> 00:26:39.440
 They just use some mushrooms, but non-magic mushrooms.

00:26:39.440 --> 00:26:40.400
 That makes sense.

00:26:40.400 --> 00:26:40.800
 It does.

00:26:40.800 --> 00:26:44.560
 One more thing about the sensational plays.

00:26:44.560 --> 00:26:48.400
 So there was rules about what you could show in the theatre

00:26:48.400 --> 00:26:49.600
 and then they got slightly loosened,

00:26:49.600 --> 00:26:50.960
 but you still had to pass things

00:26:50.960 --> 00:26:52.720
 through the law chamber in this office.

00:26:52.720 --> 00:26:54.320
 And so in the 19th century,

00:26:54.320 --> 00:26:57.760
 in order to get things through the censors,

00:26:57.760 --> 00:27:00.320
 you wouldn't put swear words in, for instance.

00:27:00.320 --> 00:27:02.400
 You would have other things that people would say.

00:27:02.400 --> 00:27:05.360
 And so you have loads of awesome insults,

00:27:05.360 --> 00:27:09.040
 like people would call each other a rascally night hawk

00:27:09.040 --> 00:27:12.560
 or a herring-gutted villain and stuff like that.

00:27:13.600 --> 00:27:18.560
 Also, sometimes, like a villain, instead of going,

00:27:18.560 --> 00:27:23.040
 "Fuck you, you bastard, you stopped my amazing plan,"

00:27:23.040 --> 00:27:24.480
 they wouldn't be able to do any of that dialogue.

00:27:24.480 --> 00:27:25.680
 You should write the scripts, actually,

00:27:25.680 --> 00:27:27.520
 if that's what the script is.

00:27:27.520 --> 00:27:28.720
 That was stunning.

00:27:28.720 --> 00:27:31.840
 Well, I would do if it could go back into the 19th century,

00:27:31.840 --> 00:27:34.240
 because instead of using that amazing dialogue,

00:27:34.240 --> 00:27:37.840
 you would just shout out whatever your psychological state was.

00:27:37.840 --> 00:27:40.880
 It was an American play, which was adapted for the British stage.

00:27:41.440 --> 00:27:43.840
 And when the villain had his plans filed,

00:27:43.840 --> 00:27:46.000
 he just shouted out, "Confusion!"

00:27:46.000 --> 00:27:53.040
 Dan, I think we have a new catchphrase for you on the podcast.

00:27:53.040 --> 00:28:05.920
 Okay, it is time for fact number three, and that is James.

00:28:05.920 --> 00:28:09.520
 Okay, my fact this week is that when it wants to sleep,

00:28:09.520 --> 00:28:14.160
 a walrus will sometimes hook its tusks onto a small iceberg

00:28:14.160 --> 00:28:16.800
 and sleep while floating along in the water.

00:28:16.800 --> 00:28:19.600
 Isn't that cute?

00:28:19.600 --> 00:28:22.640
 It's so cute, apart from the quite big, fat,

00:28:22.640 --> 00:28:27.200
 blubbery things and probably quite cold, and it's a cute idea.

00:28:27.200 --> 00:28:27.760
 It's still cute.

00:28:27.760 --> 00:28:28.800
 It's there, so cute.

00:28:28.800 --> 00:28:30.320
 I think that's very cute.

00:28:30.320 --> 00:28:31.040
 Yeah.

00:28:31.040 --> 00:28:33.280
 So a few places on the internet doubt this,

00:28:33.280 --> 00:28:36.640
 but I am pretty confident that it does sometimes happen, at least.

00:28:37.200 --> 00:28:43.360
 There was a book by Francis H. Fay called Ecology and Biology of the Pacific Walrus,

00:28:43.360 --> 00:28:45.280
 where they write that, "On numerous occasions,

00:28:45.280 --> 00:28:48.160
 I have seen walruses resting or sleeping in the water,

00:28:48.160 --> 00:28:50.640
 with their tusks hooked over the edge of the ice,

00:28:50.640 --> 00:28:53.680
 their body laying either horizontally or vertically in the water.

00:28:53.680 --> 00:28:56.480
 The tusks appear to function both as a prop for the head,

00:28:56.480 --> 00:28:58.480
 keeping the mouth and nostrils out of the water,

00:28:58.480 --> 00:29:02.160
 and as an anchor, preventing the animal from drifting away with the current."

00:29:02.160 --> 00:29:05.040
 So it does seem like it does occasionally happen.

00:29:05.040 --> 00:29:08.720
 It's not the only way they sleep, but from time to time, they will do this.

00:29:08.720 --> 00:29:10.080
 It's so sweet.

00:29:10.080 --> 00:29:12.400
 They're very promiscuous sleepers, aren't they?

00:29:12.400 --> 00:29:13.760
 What do you mean they have sex?

00:29:13.760 --> 00:29:15.360
 No, I don't at all.

00:29:15.360 --> 00:29:17.040
 I just mean they'll sleep anywhere.

00:29:17.040 --> 00:29:18.480
 They'll sleep around.

00:29:18.480 --> 00:29:21.120
 Yeah, literally around, as in different locations.

00:29:21.120 --> 00:29:26.800
 Imagine if that was another meaning of that, the misunderstandings you would have.

00:29:26.800 --> 00:29:27.920
 That's what I've been saying for years.

00:29:27.920 --> 00:29:28.400
 Yeah, yeah.

00:29:28.400 --> 00:29:30.320
 When we're on tar, you always tell your wife,

00:29:30.320 --> 00:29:32.720
 "Oh, I've been sleeping around for the last two weeks."

00:29:32.720 --> 00:29:33.280
 Absolutely.

00:29:33.280 --> 00:29:39.600
 But they sleep leaning over.

00:29:39.600 --> 00:29:40.400
 If they're in captivity,

00:29:40.400 --> 00:29:43.520
 they'll just lean up against the edge of their pool and sleep there,

00:29:43.520 --> 00:29:46.880
 or they sleep on the bottom of the water as well, which is magical.

00:29:46.880 --> 00:29:48.800
 But briefly, because otherwise they will die.

00:29:48.800 --> 00:29:51.520
 That's the most common way they sleep is on the bottom of the water,

00:29:51.520 --> 00:29:54.880
 but then they come, like you say, wake up every now and then just to breathe.

00:29:54.880 --> 00:29:58.720
 It's every three minutes they have to come up to the surface.

00:29:58.720 --> 00:29:59.600
 Really?

00:29:59.600 --> 00:30:01.600
 Yeah, it's just a nap, really, that they're having.

00:30:01.600 --> 00:30:04.640
 But they can sleep up to 90 hours, can't they?

00:30:04.640 --> 00:30:06.560
 So that's a hell of a...

00:30:06.560 --> 00:30:09.760
 When they're doing the 19-hour sleep, they're somewhere much more comfortable.

00:30:09.760 --> 00:30:14.640
 Yeah, that is like having such severe sleep apnea, really, isn't it?

00:30:14.640 --> 00:30:16.240
 Is it just every three minutes?

00:30:16.240 --> 00:30:18.000
 You're like, "Oh, my God."

00:30:18.000 --> 00:30:19.840
 Yeah, but they can sleep for 19 hours,

00:30:19.840 --> 00:30:23.680
 but they can also swim nonstop for 84 hours sometimes.

00:30:23.680 --> 00:30:26.080
 So they're just pretty hardcore.

00:30:26.080 --> 00:30:31.120
 Isn't that one of the longest that any animal is known to stay awake

00:30:31.120 --> 00:30:32.240
 in one go?

00:30:32.240 --> 00:30:33.280
 It's very unusual.

00:30:33.280 --> 00:30:37.040
 So humans can stay awake that late, that long.

00:30:37.040 --> 00:30:41.920
 But if you stay awake that long, you're going to do yourself some damage,

00:30:41.920 --> 00:30:45.600
 and you basically have to have someone holding your eyes open the whole time.

00:30:45.600 --> 00:30:47.840
 So it is possible, but it's really unusual,

00:30:47.840 --> 00:30:50.960
 but they actually do it semi-regularly, so...

00:30:50.960 --> 00:30:54.240
 Just actually how they manage to go up and down in the water is quite interesting, actually.

00:30:54.240 --> 00:30:56.880
 So when they do wake up on the bottom and need to get to the top,

00:30:56.880 --> 00:31:00.960
 they've got pharyngeal pouches, which are these air sacs between

00:31:00.960 --> 00:31:04.160
 like sort of their throat and their chest around their sternum,

00:31:04.160 --> 00:31:08.240
 and they can hold 50 litres of air, which is about the same,

00:31:08.240 --> 00:31:12.240
 I realised, as four party balloons, which actually I was most surprised at

00:31:12.240 --> 00:31:14.160
 how many litres of air a party balloon can take.

00:31:14.160 --> 00:31:16.400
 Well, that's a lot though, isn't it?

00:31:16.400 --> 00:31:19.280
 Because presumably it must blow up like a party balloon.

00:31:19.280 --> 00:31:22.560
 Yes, you can actually see the little lumps, I think, can't you,

00:31:22.560 --> 00:31:25.200
 when they're inflated, and that takes them to the top,

00:31:25.200 --> 00:31:27.520
 and that means that they can bob up and down vertically,

00:31:27.520 --> 00:31:28.880
 and I think they can sleep like that.

00:31:28.880 --> 00:31:31.360
 Wait, hang on Anna, it doesn't take them up to the top.

00:31:31.360 --> 00:31:34.400
 If they're at the bottom of the sea and they haven't remembered to inflate their pouches,

00:31:34.400 --> 00:31:36.240
 there's nothing they can do about that, there.

00:31:36.240 --> 00:31:39.040
 They use it to stay up when they're up.

00:31:39.040 --> 00:31:40.160
 Yeah, sorry.

00:31:40.160 --> 00:31:44.480
 When they breathe out, do they kind of fly around like a party balloon when you wake up?

00:31:44.480 --> 00:31:50.960
 Sometimes you hear that squeaking farting sound when you're in the sea like that.

00:31:50.960 --> 00:31:54.560
 Oh, that'd be terrifying, because they weigh over a tonne, some of them.

00:31:55.040 --> 00:31:58.560
 The one of those untethered in a room and flying around would do a lot of property damage.

00:31:58.560 --> 00:32:06.080
 They can eat as many as 6,000 clams in a single feeding session, and I went on to-

00:32:06.080 --> 00:32:07.040
 One walrus.

00:32:07.040 --> 00:32:14.240
 Yeah, one walrus in one session, 6,000 clams, and I went on to the website of a seafood merchant

00:32:14.240 --> 00:32:20.480
 in Borough Market, and that would cost £15,000 per meal if they bought their welks and clams

00:32:20.480 --> 00:32:21.920
 from Borough Market.

00:32:21.920 --> 00:32:26.160
 I don't know what sort of lovey media walrus is you're thinking about, but Borough Market is

00:32:26.160 --> 00:32:28.240
 an expensive place to buy your clams.

00:32:28.240 --> 00:32:31.120
 They're so cool, they're so weird.

00:32:31.120 --> 00:32:35.040
 Their skin is amazingly thick, obviously, because they need to keep warm in the water,

00:32:35.040 --> 00:32:39.840
 but their skin is four centimetres thick, which is about 30 times thicker than human skin.

00:32:39.840 --> 00:32:43.840
 And then under that, they have another, is it 10 centimetres of blubber?

00:32:43.840 --> 00:32:45.920
 Which is, it's such a thick layer.

00:32:45.920 --> 00:32:48.160
 They're pretty toasty, I think, in the water.

00:32:48.160 --> 00:32:49.200
 There's a lot.

00:32:49.200 --> 00:32:52.480
 And well, they're so heavy that a good way to hunt them if you're a polar bear,

00:32:52.480 --> 00:32:57.120
 if there are any polar bears listening, is to cause a stampede.

00:32:57.120 --> 00:33:01.040
 So they're actually quite difficult to hunt as a polar bear because they're so massive

00:33:01.040 --> 00:33:01.520
 on their own.

00:33:01.520 --> 00:33:05.920
 It's quite hard to kill one on its own, but they always hang out together in huge groups,

00:33:05.920 --> 00:33:09.680
 and they're so heavy that if you start chasing them, they'll stampede over each other,

00:33:09.680 --> 00:33:12.640
 and they'll often crush a few of them, a few of each other on the way,

00:33:12.640 --> 00:33:14.960
 and then you can pick up the leftovers.

00:33:14.960 --> 00:33:17.360
 The young ones are incredibly cute.

00:33:17.920 --> 00:33:21.200
 I know we were saying the bigger ones might not appear cute.

00:33:21.200 --> 00:33:21.760
 I think they are.

00:33:21.760 --> 00:33:23.120
 But the young ones definitely are.

00:33:23.120 --> 00:33:25.760
 And they're also really sweet with humans as well.

00:33:25.760 --> 00:33:31.280
 So there's been a few scientists that have talked about the fact that when a baby walrus

00:33:31.280 --> 00:33:36.800
 is, when they're working with baby walruses, it will sort of rest its head on the scientist's lap.

00:33:36.800 --> 00:33:40.160
 And then it won't feel just content with that.

00:33:40.160 --> 00:33:44.880
 It will try and climb onto the scientists as if to just cuddle it in a way that a small puppy

00:33:44.880 --> 00:33:48.320
 would just want to get on top of you and sort of cuddle into you.

00:33:48.320 --> 00:33:50.080
 That is quite cute.

00:33:50.080 --> 00:33:53.360
 But what if it thinks you're an ice floe and then tries to dig it?

00:33:53.360 --> 00:33:55.520
 That's what it feels like.

00:33:55.520 --> 00:33:56.880
 These are humans with ice floes.

00:33:56.880 --> 00:33:58.400
 Yeah, they're not musseldwells, mate.

00:33:58.400 --> 00:34:00.000
 They're not just going to go stab at anyone.

00:34:00.000 --> 00:34:04.160
 It feels like they're climbing on top of you like they think you're a lump of ice or something.

00:34:04.160 --> 00:34:07.360
 I think it's because they're thigmo-tactic.

00:34:07.360 --> 00:34:10.080
 So they're very similar to earwigs in this one way,

00:34:10.080 --> 00:34:14.240
 which is that they're positively thigmo-tactic, which means that they love being touched.

00:34:14.240 --> 00:34:15.920
 They're incredibly social, like you say.

00:34:15.920 --> 00:34:18.400
 And that's why they're often huddled together in big groups

00:34:18.400 --> 00:34:20.720
 because they are always touching each other.

00:34:20.720 --> 00:34:24.080
 90% of walruses will be touching another walrus when they land.

00:34:24.080 --> 00:34:28.720
 And so when you look after them, when they're in captivity,

00:34:28.720 --> 00:34:31.680
 like at the Alaska Sea Life Center, I think, for instance,

00:34:31.680 --> 00:34:35.280
 they employ four people round the clock per walrus

00:34:35.280 --> 00:34:37.520
 to be there just hugging it and keeping it in front of them.

00:34:37.520 --> 00:34:38.800
 Oh, no.

00:34:38.800 --> 00:34:39.600
 Wow.

00:34:39.600 --> 00:34:40.960
 That's what they do.

00:34:40.960 --> 00:34:43.440
 Four walrus huggers for every walrus.

00:34:43.440 --> 00:34:43.920
 Wow.

00:34:43.920 --> 00:34:46.000
 I think they serve other purposes as well.

00:34:46.000 --> 00:34:46.880
 You know, they feed them.

00:34:46.880 --> 00:34:49.680
 You can't do much while you're hugging a walrus, you know.

00:34:49.680 --> 00:34:50.960
 You can be on your phone.

00:34:50.960 --> 00:34:51.680
 You can be on your phone.

00:34:51.680 --> 00:34:52.400
 Yeah, you're right.

00:34:52.400 --> 00:34:57.040
 But then, I mean, no one wants to be hugged by someone who's also,

00:34:57.040 --> 00:34:58.880
 like, doob-scrolling down Switzerland.

00:34:58.880 --> 00:34:59.920
 That is a really good point.

00:34:59.920 --> 00:35:01.600
 No, the walruses do have a tendency to go,

00:35:01.600 --> 00:35:03.920
 "Look, can you put your phone down for having a moment?"

00:35:03.920 --> 00:35:09.280
 I was looking up an experiment that was done on walruses,

00:35:09.280 --> 00:35:11.280
 and this was in 2009.

00:35:11.280 --> 00:35:12.720
 You know Six Flags?

00:35:12.720 --> 00:35:14.560
 The theme park in America?

00:35:14.560 --> 00:35:14.880
 No.

00:35:14.880 --> 00:35:18.080
 So, it's a huge chain of theme parks in America,

00:35:18.080 --> 00:35:21.600
 and they have a few branches all over the place.

00:35:21.600 --> 00:35:24.640
 But in 2009, Six Flags in California

00:35:24.640 --> 00:35:27.040
 built an artificial walrus vagina.

00:35:27.040 --> 00:35:28.160
 Did they?

00:35:28.160 --> 00:35:28.880
 Okay.

00:35:28.880 --> 00:35:29.360
 Yeah.

00:35:29.360 --> 00:35:30.240
 Like a roller coaster.

00:35:30.240 --> 00:35:34.720
 It was not for the public to have a go on.

00:35:34.720 --> 00:35:35.680
 Oh, okay.

00:35:35.680 --> 00:35:36.640
 What was it for then?

00:35:36.640 --> 00:35:37.520
 It's in a theme park.

00:35:37.520 --> 00:35:39.120
 It's a walrus vagina?

00:35:39.120 --> 00:35:39.600
 Yeah.

00:35:39.600 --> 00:35:42.960
 This is an animal-focused branch of the theme park,

00:35:42.960 --> 00:35:44.960
 and they had a few walruses in,

00:35:44.960 --> 00:35:48.240
 and they wanted their walrus civuqueck

00:35:48.240 --> 00:35:51.200
 to perform some sexual acts,

00:35:51.200 --> 00:35:54.560
 so they could get their first ever semen sample of walrus.

00:35:54.560 --> 00:35:55.840
 Oh, I see.

00:35:55.840 --> 00:35:56.160
 Yeah.

00:35:56.160 --> 00:35:59.840
 And there was a scientist called Holly Marasso,

00:35:59.840 --> 00:36:01.680
 or Maracca, I'm not sure how that's pronounced.

00:36:01.680 --> 00:36:05.280
 But she was in charge of this,

00:36:05.280 --> 00:36:08.320
 and the largest artificial vagina on the market

00:36:08.320 --> 00:36:09.200
 was too small.

00:36:09.200 --> 00:36:12.240
 They did buy one, which was used for cart horses,

00:36:12.240 --> 00:36:14.480
 but it was tiny compared to what civuqueck needed.

00:36:14.480 --> 00:36:16.320
 If they come to my and summer's party

00:36:16.320 --> 00:36:17.280
 that I had last week.

00:36:17.280 --> 00:36:21.280
 Well, his penis was 22 inches around,

00:36:21.280 --> 00:36:24.240
 and they had to custom-build it from a big old pipe,

00:36:24.240 --> 00:36:26.240
 because it was just too huge.

00:36:26.240 --> 00:36:27.120
 That's amazing.

00:36:27.120 --> 00:36:28.400
 And I wrote to her.

00:36:28.400 --> 00:36:29.200
 I wrote to the scientist,

00:36:29.200 --> 00:36:30.640
 but she hasn't got back in touch with me.

00:36:30.640 --> 00:36:33.120
 So I said, yeah, amazingly.

00:36:37.120 --> 00:36:39.360
 Sally, I don't think it worked, did it?

00:36:39.360 --> 00:36:42.160
 I think civuqueck died childless.

00:36:42.160 --> 00:36:45.520
 He was very obedient, though, I think, civuqueck.

00:36:45.520 --> 00:36:47.840
 So he was very good at exposing himself,

00:36:47.840 --> 00:36:50.080
 and she learned what turned him on.

00:36:50.080 --> 00:36:52.160
 So she realized that when there were workmen

00:36:52.160 --> 00:36:55.040
 using power tools, hammers and stuff nearby,

00:36:55.040 --> 00:36:56.640
 he would expose his penis,

00:36:56.640 --> 00:36:58.720
 and that he just particularly liked those sounds.

00:36:58.720 --> 00:37:00.240
 He was aroused by them.

00:37:00.240 --> 00:37:03.520
 And so eventually they made these certain noises

00:37:03.520 --> 00:37:05.200
 to make him expose himself,

00:37:05.200 --> 00:37:06.560
 and then they trained him,

00:37:06.560 --> 00:37:08.400
 eventually, to roll over and expose himself

00:37:08.400 --> 00:37:09.680
 on the word penis.

00:37:09.680 --> 00:37:11.200
 So you just shouted, "Penis!"

00:37:11.200 --> 00:37:14.400
 Imagine if you listened to this podcast.

00:37:14.400 --> 00:37:18.240
 He'd never get back on his back again.

00:37:18.240 --> 00:37:23.440
 One thing I find interesting about walrus vaginas, actually,

00:37:23.440 --> 00:37:26.400
 and I assume this is true of lots of other animals,

00:37:26.400 --> 00:37:27.920
 but I'd never seen it before,

00:37:27.920 --> 00:37:31.360
 is male walruses are famous for having

00:37:31.360 --> 00:37:33.600
 bones in their penises, the baculum,

00:37:33.600 --> 00:37:36.480
 which is the longest, I think, in the animal kingdom,

00:37:36.480 --> 00:37:38.000
 the walrus baculum.

00:37:38.000 --> 00:37:42.400
 But they also have a clitoral bone walruses.

00:37:42.400 --> 00:37:44.720
 So they have a bone in the clitoris.

00:37:44.720 --> 00:37:47.200
 And this is something that does happen in a few animals,

00:37:47.200 --> 00:37:51.280
 but is obviously less common than the penis bone.

00:37:51.280 --> 00:37:53.440
 And it's called a borbellum.

00:37:53.440 --> 00:37:54.720
 I've never heard that word before.

00:37:54.720 --> 00:37:59.360
 A clitoral, a borbellum, B-A-U-B-E-W-L-U-M.

00:37:59.360 --> 00:38:02.720
 And that's what you call a clitoris bone.

00:38:02.720 --> 00:38:03.840
 So look out for that word.

00:38:03.840 --> 00:38:08.800
 Their teeth are very crucial, as in their tusks.

00:38:08.800 --> 00:38:10.880
 So they have a hierarchical system,

00:38:10.880 --> 00:38:13.280
 but the most important thing to your social status,

00:38:13.280 --> 00:38:15.760
 they think in walrus hierarchies is the tusk.

00:38:15.760 --> 00:38:18.480
 So if you break a tooth, if you have a bike accident or something,

00:38:18.480 --> 00:38:21.600
 then suddenly you go from being the most sought after desirable man on the block

00:38:21.600 --> 00:38:22.320
 to being nothing.

00:38:22.320 --> 00:38:24.000
 Wow, so weird.

00:38:24.000 --> 00:38:25.120
 Oh, that's awful.

00:38:25.120 --> 00:38:27.520
 They do walk on them, don't they?

00:38:27.520 --> 00:38:28.560
 On their teeth.

00:38:28.560 --> 00:38:29.120
 What do you mean?

00:38:29.120 --> 00:38:31.280
 They sort of walk on them.

00:38:31.280 --> 00:38:36.080
 And in fact, their scientific name is odobanus rosmarus,

00:38:36.080 --> 00:38:38.400
 which literally means tooth walking seahorse.

00:38:38.400 --> 00:38:40.800
 It's a combination of latter than old Norse.

00:38:40.800 --> 00:38:45.600
 And it's because they jam their tusks into the ice to drag themselves along.

00:38:45.600 --> 00:38:48.000
 A bit like locking onto the icebergs.

00:38:48.000 --> 00:38:48.560
 Yeah, they do.

00:38:48.560 --> 00:38:50.640
 And they also use them to break up the ice.

00:38:50.640 --> 00:38:56.560
 So there was an example of the females get very protective over their children.

00:38:56.560 --> 00:38:59.600
 So if you get in between the child and the mother,

00:38:59.600 --> 00:39:01.040
 then she'll come after you.

00:39:01.040 --> 00:39:04.400
 And there was an example of some scientists kind of moving a child

00:39:04.400 --> 00:39:05.680
 from one place to another.

00:39:05.680 --> 00:39:10.000
 And the mother came after them and kind of slammed her face down

00:39:10.000 --> 00:39:14.640
 with her tusks into the ice and used it as an ice breaker to open up the route.

00:39:14.640 --> 00:39:16.400
 So she could swim through it.

00:39:16.400 --> 00:39:18.160
 Wow, that's so cool.

00:39:18.160 --> 00:39:18.640
 It's scary.

00:39:18.640 --> 00:39:21.120
 That's the stuff in horror films.

00:39:21.120 --> 00:39:23.280
 I know because they swim really fast as well.

00:39:23.280 --> 00:39:25.840
 Like they can swim three times faster than Michael Phelps.

00:39:25.840 --> 00:39:30.640
 So 22 miles an hour max speed.

00:39:30.640 --> 00:39:34.400
 So imagine that coming at you with smashing down its tusks

00:39:34.400 --> 00:39:38.320
 and swimming at three times as fast as Michael Phelps down still cute or...

00:39:38.320 --> 00:39:42.480
 I, all I'm thinking is Earl Tupper missed a trick by getting just fish.

00:39:42.480 --> 00:39:43.680
 He should have strapped a walrus.

00:39:43.680 --> 00:39:53.120
 OK, it is time for our final fact of the show.

00:39:53.120 --> 00:39:54.320
 And that is my fact.

00:39:54.320 --> 00:39:59.120
 My fact this week is that for many years, the horror film The Unknown was missing.

00:39:59.680 --> 00:40:02.320
 Because the last surviving print was accidentally placed

00:40:02.320 --> 00:40:05.600
 into a pile of hundreds of film cans all marked unknown.

00:40:05.600 --> 00:40:10.560
 So this was a movie that was made in 1927.

00:40:10.560 --> 00:40:12.800
 And it was fairly popular in its time.

00:40:12.800 --> 00:40:15.120
 It started a very big actor called Lon Chaney.

00:40:15.120 --> 00:40:18.720
 And the prints, as for a lot of movies around this time,

00:40:18.720 --> 00:40:20.960
 just went missing and no one knew where it was.

00:40:20.960 --> 00:40:24.320
 And in 1973, after years and years of it being missing,

00:40:24.320 --> 00:40:28.880
 it was discovered in the archives of the Cinématec Française,

00:40:28.880 --> 00:40:33.600
 which is a big institution in France that has lots of archived movies.

00:40:33.600 --> 00:40:36.160
 And someone must have accidentally taken their copy

00:40:36.160 --> 00:40:40.240
 and popped it into a big room that had a bunch of unknowns

00:40:40.240 --> 00:40:42.640
 of films that had no information about them.

00:40:42.640 --> 00:40:45.680
 And so there it sat for all these years until they uncovered it.

00:40:45.680 --> 00:40:48.560
 And it's great that we have it again.

00:40:48.560 --> 00:40:50.720
 Because as I say, Lon Chaney, big deal in his day.

00:40:50.720 --> 00:40:52.720
 Sounds like an amazing movie, doesn't it?

00:40:52.720 --> 00:40:52.960
 Yeah.

00:40:52.960 --> 00:40:56.720
 It's about, well, it's about this guy who is a criminal

00:40:57.440 --> 00:41:01.520
 and he goes to the circus pretending to be someone with no arms.

00:41:01.520 --> 00:41:05.920
 And so to do that, he kind of ties his arms to his torso

00:41:05.920 --> 00:41:08.080
 and then wears a shirt and a clove

00:41:08.080 --> 00:41:10.240
 so no one can tell that he actually has arms.

00:41:10.240 --> 00:41:14.160
 And then he falls in love with this woman, Nanon,

00:41:14.160 --> 00:41:16.720
 played by Joan Crawford before she became really famous.

00:41:16.720 --> 00:41:20.880
 And she is terrified of being touched by men.

00:41:20.880 --> 00:41:23.360
 So that works even better that he doesn't have any arms,

00:41:23.360 --> 00:41:24.480
 even though he does have arms.

00:41:24.480 --> 00:41:25.520
 And then...

00:41:25.520 --> 00:41:27.440
 Much made in heaven, that's so sweet.

00:41:27.440 --> 00:41:28.560
 I know, isn't it?

00:41:28.560 --> 00:41:31.280
 And then, well, it is until she finds out on his wedding night

00:41:31.280 --> 00:41:32.480
 that he has arms.

00:41:32.480 --> 00:41:34.160
 Oh, no.

00:41:34.160 --> 00:41:40.560
 Anyway, so he then has a rival called Zanzi and kills him.

00:41:40.560 --> 00:41:44.240
 But the police can't take any fingerprints from him

00:41:44.240 --> 00:41:45.520
 because he doesn't have any arms.

00:41:45.520 --> 00:41:47.200
 And so he escapes.

00:41:47.200 --> 00:41:47.920
 How does he kill him?

00:41:47.920 --> 00:41:49.600
 He has arms.

00:41:49.600 --> 00:41:50.080
 He has arms.

00:41:50.080 --> 00:41:52.400
 Oh, sorry, everyone thinks that he doesn't have arms.

00:41:52.400 --> 00:41:54.880
 Oh, God, I fell into his trap thinking he didn't have arms.

00:41:54.880 --> 00:41:55.760
 I should have known.

00:41:55.760 --> 00:41:57.600
 Did he kill him?

00:41:57.600 --> 00:42:00.000
 Because Zanzi or whatever he's called, saw that he had arms.

00:42:00.000 --> 00:42:01.520
 And he was like, there's nothing left to do now,

00:42:01.520 --> 00:42:02.560
 but for me to kill you.

00:42:02.560 --> 00:42:03.040
 You know what?

00:42:03.040 --> 00:42:04.320
 I've gone too far already,

00:42:04.320 --> 00:42:06.560
 because we're always giving away spoilers on this show.

00:42:06.560 --> 00:42:08.400
 And I get so much shit for it on Twitter.

00:42:08.400 --> 00:42:10.480
 I'm not going to tell you what happens at the end of this movie,

00:42:10.480 --> 00:42:11.520
 but it's really good.

00:42:11.520 --> 00:42:13.760
 And one amazing thing about it is that...

00:42:13.760 --> 00:42:15.920
 What was the name of the guy who played him, Dan?

00:42:15.920 --> 00:42:19.520
 Lon Chaney, C-H-A-N-E-Y, Chaney, you reckon?

00:42:19.520 --> 00:42:20.880
 Lon Chaney, yeah, that's right.

00:42:20.880 --> 00:42:24.000
 But he had a stunt double called Paul Desmouc,

00:42:24.000 --> 00:42:25.760
 who didn't have any arms,

00:42:25.760 --> 00:42:27.600
 because in the play,

00:42:27.600 --> 00:42:31.120
 the character had to drink with his feet,

00:42:31.120 --> 00:42:33.840
 or he had to throw things for his feet in the circus.

00:42:33.840 --> 00:42:34.960
 He was like a knife thrower,

00:42:34.960 --> 00:42:36.480
 but he did it all with his feet.

00:42:36.480 --> 00:42:39.280
 And so he had this actual performer called Paul Desmouc,

00:42:39.280 --> 00:42:40.720
 who would do all this stuff for him.

00:42:40.720 --> 00:42:42.720
 And the way that they did it

00:42:42.720 --> 00:42:44.480
 is sometimes he would double for him

00:42:44.480 --> 00:42:46.080
 if you could do it with the shots and stuff,

00:42:46.080 --> 00:42:47.600
 if you could not see his face.

00:42:47.600 --> 00:42:50.640
 But most of the time, Desmouc was doing the same job,

00:42:50.640 --> 00:42:52.960
 but he was doing it just with his legs

00:42:52.960 --> 00:42:57.200
 and perfectly synchronized his legs with the actor's body.

00:42:57.200 --> 00:42:58.320
 And so they cut it.

00:42:58.320 --> 00:43:00.320
 So you only saw the top of the actor's body

00:43:00.320 --> 00:43:02.320
 and the bottom of the stunt double's legs,

00:43:02.320 --> 00:43:03.680
 and so they could do all that stuff.

00:43:03.680 --> 00:43:04.320
 Isn't that cool?

00:43:04.320 --> 00:43:05.200
 That's so clever.

00:43:05.200 --> 00:43:08.800
 So a man with no arms pretending to be a man with arms

00:43:08.800 --> 00:43:10.240
 pretending to be a man with no arms.

00:43:10.240 --> 00:43:12.320
 It's many layers.

00:43:12.320 --> 00:43:15.600
 It's like the Shakespearean boys pretending to be girls to be boys,

00:43:15.600 --> 00:43:16.240
 isn't it?

00:43:16.240 --> 00:43:16.320
 Yeah.

00:43:16.320 --> 00:43:16.480
 Yeah.

00:43:16.480 --> 00:43:18.640
 And that's on my blur.

00:43:18.640 --> 00:43:19.120
 Is that?

00:43:19.120 --> 00:43:19.360
 Yeah.

00:43:20.960 --> 00:43:23.440
 Boys with no arms who like girls, who have arms,

00:43:23.440 --> 00:43:25.360
 but hate men who have arms.

00:43:25.360 --> 00:43:30.000
 Dan, you mentioned Lon Cheney.

00:43:30.000 --> 00:43:30.800
 Yeah.

00:43:30.800 --> 00:43:32.240
 He does sound incredible.

00:43:32.240 --> 00:43:32.400
 Yeah.

00:43:32.400 --> 00:43:35.200
 So he played so many different things.

00:43:35.200 --> 00:43:39.120
 He was called the man of a thousand faces

00:43:39.120 --> 00:43:41.280
 because he appeared in all these different costumes,

00:43:41.280 --> 00:43:42.480
 all these different roles.

00:43:42.480 --> 00:43:44.320
 I mean, I've written down clowns and pirates.

00:43:44.320 --> 00:43:46.320
 I imagine his brain was even broader than that.

00:43:46.320 --> 00:43:48.800
 He played lots of foreign people,

00:43:48.800 --> 00:43:51.360
 which obviously you probably wouldn't do today.

00:43:51.360 --> 00:43:54.000
 But in the 1920s, he played so many different roles

00:43:54.000 --> 00:43:56.240
 and kinds of person that there was a popular joke.

00:43:56.240 --> 00:43:57.120
 And this was the joke.

00:43:57.120 --> 00:43:59.280
 It was, don't step on that spider.

00:43:59.280 --> 00:44:00.640
 It might be Lon Cheney.

00:44:00.640 --> 00:44:01.760
 Well, that's familiar.

00:44:01.760 --> 00:44:07.440
 And he was a master of disguise in terms of his dedication

00:44:07.440 --> 00:44:10.400
 to makeup within the movies he was in.

00:44:10.400 --> 00:44:11.840
 So like there's, for example, there's one movie

00:44:11.840 --> 00:44:13.760
 where he plays both the hero and the villain.

00:44:13.760 --> 00:44:17.600
 And he was so convinced that his makeup could transform that.

00:44:17.600 --> 00:44:20.640
 When he played Quasimodo in The Hunchback of Notre Dame,

00:44:20.640 --> 00:44:23.440
 he took the idea of having a growth over his eye

00:44:23.440 --> 00:44:26.000
 so seriously that with the makeup done,

00:44:26.000 --> 00:44:29.120
 it resulted in him having permanent short-sightedness

00:44:29.120 --> 00:44:32.080
 of the stress that he put on, onto his body.

00:44:32.080 --> 00:44:34.480
 He often used to put himself in physical pain

00:44:34.480 --> 00:44:36.320
 in order to get that appearance right.

00:44:36.320 --> 00:44:40.400
 So he, when he was playing a legless criminal mastermind.

00:44:40.400 --> 00:44:43.200
 So he, in another movie, played a legless criminal.

00:44:43.200 --> 00:44:47.040
 He bound his legs into a tight harness.

00:44:47.040 --> 00:44:50.160
 And that actually cut off a lot of blood vessels in his legs

00:44:50.160 --> 00:44:52.480
 so that he did kind of lose the use of his legs.

00:44:52.480 --> 00:44:54.240
 Oh, right. But then for the sequel,

00:44:54.240 --> 00:44:55.840
 he didn't have to have a stunt double.

00:44:55.840 --> 00:44:57.040
 So that was useful.

00:44:57.040 --> 00:44:58.560
 So yeah, exactly.

00:44:58.560 --> 00:45:00.640
 But yeah, and he was a big guy.

00:45:00.640 --> 00:45:03.520
 He was a silent movie guy that was in that transfer

00:45:03.520 --> 00:45:04.960
 to the talkies.

00:45:04.960 --> 00:45:08.160
 And in fact, when it became the talkies,

00:45:08.160 --> 00:45:10.960
 it was so interesting, he wrote for his first movie

00:45:10.960 --> 00:45:13.040
 because he did five different voices

00:45:13.040 --> 00:45:15.200
 in his first ever talking movie.

00:45:15.200 --> 00:45:17.280
 He signed a statement to attest to the fact

00:45:17.280 --> 00:45:18.960
 that it was in fact his voices.

00:45:18.960 --> 00:45:22.560
 And this was sort of published so that people believed

00:45:22.560 --> 00:45:24.480
 that it was him who had an actual voice

00:45:24.480 --> 00:45:25.360
 and that he was talking.

00:45:25.360 --> 00:45:28.880
 Was that publicity for the film?

00:45:28.880 --> 00:45:31.280
 So because people wanted to hear him talk?

00:45:31.280 --> 00:45:32.000
 Yes, exactly.

00:45:32.000 --> 00:45:33.440
 No, it was publicity just to say,

00:45:33.440 --> 00:45:35.360
 you may think that this is being dubbed.

00:45:35.360 --> 00:45:36.880
 I'm not just the man of a thousand faces.

00:45:36.880 --> 00:45:37.840
 I also do voices.

00:45:37.840 --> 00:45:41.760
 And the man of a thousand faces, five voices, no legs.

00:45:44.720 --> 00:45:47.680
 Yeah, these lost films are incredible.

00:45:47.680 --> 00:45:49.680
 The ones that keep popping up everywhere.

00:45:49.680 --> 00:45:53.120
 And you mentioned the Cinématec Francaise, was it, Dan?

00:45:53.120 --> 00:45:53.760
 Yes.

00:45:53.760 --> 00:45:56.640
 They have been recategorising their films since 1992.

00:45:56.640 --> 00:46:00.000
 So nearly 30 years now,

00:46:00.000 --> 00:46:01.680
 and they still have another decade to go.

00:46:01.680 --> 00:46:03.600
 They've just got so many films that they're trying

00:46:03.600 --> 00:46:05.040
 to work out what they all are.

00:46:05.040 --> 00:46:07.840
 It's quite hard to tell the difference between a lost film

00:46:07.840 --> 00:46:09.840
 and a film that no one's looked for yet.

00:46:09.840 --> 00:46:12.160
 I think this is a problem that the BFI had

00:46:12.160 --> 00:46:17.200
 when they created, in 2010, their 75 Most Wanted Films List.

00:46:17.200 --> 00:46:20.160
 And they've been finding them at a rate of knots, really.

00:46:20.160 --> 00:46:22.240
 I mean, as soon as they publish it, people are getting in touch,

00:46:22.240 --> 00:46:23.920
 going, oh yeah, I got the DVD of that.

00:46:23.920 --> 00:46:24.800
 Yeah, yeah, here you go.

00:46:24.800 --> 00:46:28.320
 Which is such great news.

00:46:28.320 --> 00:46:30.960
 So of the top 75, they've discovered 18.

00:46:30.960 --> 00:46:33.840
 I think maybe one of them, or a film that was famously lost,

00:46:33.840 --> 00:46:39.280
 was Gaslight, which is interesting because the reason it was lost

00:46:39.280 --> 00:46:44.240
 is because MGM tried to gaslight us into thinking it didn't exist,

00:46:44.240 --> 00:46:45.840
 confusingly.

00:46:45.840 --> 00:46:50.240
 So this was the original film called Gaslight was released in 1940,

00:46:50.240 --> 00:46:52.080
 and I think it was a British version.

00:46:52.080 --> 00:46:55.680
 And then MGM got the rights to it and released it in 1944,

00:46:55.680 --> 00:46:57.520
 but they got the rights on the one condition

00:46:57.520 --> 00:46:59.680
 that all copies of the 1940 film,

00:46:59.680 --> 00:47:01.840
 even all the negatives, were completely destroyed.

00:47:01.840 --> 00:47:04.080
 So if anyone said, what's the film Gaslight?

00:47:04.080 --> 00:47:05.120
 They'd be, it's this one.

00:47:05.120 --> 00:47:06.000
 What are you talking about?

00:47:06.000 --> 00:47:08.080
 This is the film Gaslight.

00:47:08.080 --> 00:47:11.040
 And the only reason, actually, we have the original 1941

00:47:11.040 --> 00:47:14.000
 is because the director of it, who was called Thorold Dickinson,

00:47:14.000 --> 00:47:16.640
 for much cooler names in the olden days,

00:47:16.640 --> 00:47:18.400
 had made his own personal copy.

00:47:18.400 --> 00:47:20.960
 And so he went and produced it.

00:47:20.960 --> 00:47:24.000
 And that's where the word gaslighting today comes from, isn't it?

00:47:24.000 --> 00:47:26.880
 Because it was the movie, maybe based on a novel,

00:47:26.880 --> 00:47:30.000
 I'm not sure, but it's based on someone's boyfriend

00:47:30.000 --> 00:47:32.400
 who tries to convince her that she's gone mad or something.

00:47:32.400 --> 00:47:34.880
 Yeah, based on the player, I think.

00:47:34.880 --> 00:47:36.720
 It's, isn't it, he tries to convince her

00:47:36.720 --> 00:47:40.160
 that it's something to do with gaslighting in the house?

00:47:40.160 --> 00:47:42.480
 I can't remember what he's explaining or it's, yeah.

00:47:42.480 --> 00:47:46.480
 Yeah, so he's always, he basically makes the lights go down lower.

00:47:46.480 --> 00:47:49.680
 And then she, who's played by Ingrid Bergman, says,

00:47:49.680 --> 00:47:50.880
 the lights have gone lower.

00:47:50.880 --> 00:47:52.400
 And he says, no, they're not, you've gone mad.

00:47:52.400 --> 00:47:54.640
 And then he does lots of other stuff.

00:47:54.640 --> 00:47:56.480
 But he shouldn't, I mean, that's not a really

00:47:56.480 --> 00:47:58.720
 an obvious symptom of going mad, is it really?

00:47:58.720 --> 00:48:00.720
 He should have like dressed as a rabbit

00:48:00.720 --> 00:48:03.840
 and danced around in the front room and said, did you see that?

00:48:03.840 --> 00:48:04.800
 He's like, what are you on about?

00:48:04.800 --> 00:48:05.680
 That would be...

00:48:05.680 --> 00:48:06.800
 That was the next scene.

00:48:06.800 --> 00:48:09.120
 He should have got Lon Chaney in to do one of his

00:48:09.120 --> 00:48:11.200
 weird jumping around with no arm.

00:48:11.200 --> 00:48:13.760
 Lon Chaney appears to be stuck in the bath.

00:48:13.760 --> 00:48:14.960
 No, no.

00:48:14.960 --> 00:48:18.080
 What are you on about?

00:48:18.080 --> 00:48:20.720
 Just your mind playing tricks again.

00:48:20.720 --> 00:48:21.360
 Oh, that's it.

00:48:21.360 --> 00:48:23.680
 Lon Chaney's back and this time he's got eight legs.

00:48:23.680 --> 00:48:29.680
 One famous movie that's missing is

00:48:29.680 --> 00:48:34.560
 The Arrival of a Train at Van Sen Station by Georges Mellier.

00:48:34.560 --> 00:48:38.720
 So one of the oldest of all the cinematographers,

00:48:38.720 --> 00:48:41.440
 a French guy who did lots of really early,

00:48:41.440 --> 00:48:44.000
 very, very short movies of things happening.

00:48:44.000 --> 00:48:47.200
 For instance, trains arriving at stations and stuff like that.

00:48:47.200 --> 00:48:49.680
 But what I find really interesting about this one

00:48:49.680 --> 00:48:54.000
 is an 1896 film, which we don't know where it is.

00:48:54.000 --> 00:48:57.680
 But what we do have is we have a flip book of the film,

00:48:58.240 --> 00:49:02.240
 which in 1896 is essentially the same thing.

00:49:02.240 --> 00:49:02.960
 Yeah, so cool.

00:49:02.960 --> 00:49:06.480
 The one just every frame has become a page in the book.

00:49:06.480 --> 00:49:06.960
 Wow.

00:49:06.960 --> 00:49:09.280
 Have they stitched it back together to turn it back into a film?

00:49:09.280 --> 00:49:10.160
 They should do something.

00:49:10.160 --> 00:49:12.080
 They should, because then they can say it's based on a book.

00:49:12.080 --> 00:49:14.960
 That's popular for films.

00:49:14.960 --> 00:49:19.840
 There is, weirdly, just a combo fact there.

00:49:19.840 --> 00:49:23.120
 There's a myth that when film was in its infancy,

00:49:23.120 --> 00:49:25.920
 there was a silent movie.

00:49:25.920 --> 00:49:27.600
 It was just of a train arriving in a station.

00:49:28.400 --> 00:49:30.160
 But I think it was face-on.

00:49:30.160 --> 00:49:32.560
 It might have been by the Lumiere brothers.

00:49:32.560 --> 00:49:34.960
 So the train is coming right towards the camera.

00:49:34.960 --> 00:49:35.920
 Oh, yeah.

00:49:35.920 --> 00:49:39.440
 There was a myth that this was so realistic and terrifying

00:49:39.440 --> 00:49:42.160
 for the audience who'd never seen cinema before,

00:49:42.160 --> 00:49:43.760
 that the audience bolted.

00:49:43.760 --> 00:49:46.000
 They all shit themselves en masse.

00:49:46.000 --> 00:49:49.840
 Every one of the 500 people shit themselves.

00:49:49.840 --> 00:49:53.680
 No, that's not the urban myth.

00:49:53.680 --> 00:49:54.800
 It's a good urban myth.

00:49:54.800 --> 00:49:56.000
 That's the one I've been spreading.

00:49:56.240 --> 00:50:00.080
 Anyway, it doesn't seem to have ever happened.

00:50:00.080 --> 00:50:00.560
 That's the thing.

00:50:00.560 --> 00:50:03.760
 No one has ever bolted or shat themselves en masse

00:50:03.760 --> 00:50:05.120
 if they still put it on a train.

00:50:05.120 --> 00:50:07.600
 Another film which has gone missing

00:50:07.600 --> 00:50:11.680
 is the first film ever directed by an African-American.

00:50:11.680 --> 00:50:14.560
 And actually loads of these have gone missing.

00:50:14.560 --> 00:50:16.560
 So there was a thing which I didn't know about,

00:50:16.560 --> 00:50:21.680
 which went from 1915 all the way up to the 1950s called race films.

00:50:21.680 --> 00:50:25.120
 And what it was was Hollywood was making all these movies.

00:50:25.120 --> 00:50:26.480
 But at the same time,

00:50:26.480 --> 00:50:29.600
 other people were making films specifically for black people.

00:50:29.600 --> 00:50:30.960
 So you would have black directors.

00:50:30.960 --> 00:50:32.160
 You would have black actors.

00:50:32.160 --> 00:50:33.360
 You would have black producers.

00:50:33.360 --> 00:50:35.840
 You'd have basically black people doing the whole thing.

00:50:35.840 --> 00:50:38.080
 But they would only be shown in theaters

00:50:38.080 --> 00:50:39.440
 that were usually segregated

00:50:39.440 --> 00:50:41.360
 so that only black people could even watch them.

00:50:41.360 --> 00:50:44.640
 And there were like hundreds and hundreds of these things made,

00:50:44.640 --> 00:50:46.480
 but almost all of them went missing.

00:50:46.480 --> 00:50:50.400
 And then in 1983, there was a place called

00:50:50.400 --> 00:50:53.360
 the Southwest Film Video Archives in Dallas.

00:50:54.000 --> 00:50:57.440
 And they rang up this kind of historian and said,

00:50:57.440 --> 00:50:59.440
 "Look, there's a load of old tapes here.

00:50:59.440 --> 00:51:01.600
 They're just taking up a load of space.

00:51:01.600 --> 00:51:02.880
 We're going to get rid of them.

00:51:02.880 --> 00:51:04.480
 Do you want to have a look through them?"

00:51:04.480 --> 00:51:06.480
 And he went, "Okay, well, I'm going to have a look through them."

00:51:06.480 --> 00:51:08.960
 And it turned out that it was all of these old,

00:51:08.960 --> 00:51:10.320
 what they call, race films.

00:51:10.320 --> 00:51:11.920
 And now we have loads of them back

00:51:11.920 --> 00:51:14.640
 and they're restoring them all and people can watch them again.

00:51:14.640 --> 00:51:15.600
 - Wow. - Isn't that cool?

00:51:15.600 --> 00:51:17.200
 That is so cool.

00:51:17.200 --> 00:51:20.240
 It's amazing how little people thought ahead at the time.

00:51:20.240 --> 00:51:21.440
 It's something that actually Alex,

00:51:21.440 --> 00:51:24.000
 our colleague, gets really agitated about

00:51:24.000 --> 00:51:26.400
 when so much of the BBC's archives have gone missing

00:51:26.400 --> 00:51:28.800
 because they just didn't really preserve stuff.

00:51:28.800 --> 00:51:30.640
 - Well, they taped over it.

00:51:30.640 --> 00:51:32.000
 It wasn't that it went missing.

00:51:32.000 --> 00:51:35.040
 They decided that all these tapes were useless,

00:51:35.040 --> 00:51:36.720
 hanging out in the back rooms.

00:51:36.720 --> 00:51:40.800
 Classic comedies that were made were all destroyed.

00:51:40.800 --> 00:51:42.800
 So Peter Cook, British comedian,

00:51:42.800 --> 00:51:45.280
 he begged the BBC to give him the tapes

00:51:45.280 --> 00:51:46.480
 so that they wouldn't be destroyed.

00:51:46.480 --> 00:51:48.000
 "I'll buy you new tapes," he said,

00:51:48.000 --> 00:51:49.200
 "and you can have fresh ones."

00:51:49.200 --> 00:51:50.720
 And they still said, "No, it's our property,

00:51:50.720 --> 00:51:53.120
 "so we're just going to make sure it's kind of destroyed."

00:51:53.120 --> 00:51:55.120
 - No way. - Yeah, so it wasn't even lost.

00:51:55.120 --> 00:51:56.400
 It was actively destroyed.

00:51:56.400 --> 00:51:58.640
 - We should say why they also,

00:51:58.640 --> 00:51:59.680
 why there are so few,

00:51:59.680 --> 00:52:01.520
 another reason as apart from people destroying them

00:52:01.520 --> 00:52:04.160
 is that they just burn so easily.

00:52:04.160 --> 00:52:05.440
 They set on fire.

00:52:05.440 --> 00:52:07.120
 The early film, "Nitrate" film,

00:52:07.120 --> 00:52:09.360
 it can combust at 41 degrees Celsius.

00:52:09.360 --> 00:52:11.440
 - And you're in LA.

00:52:11.440 --> 00:52:14.240
 - I know, I mean, it's...

00:52:14.240 --> 00:52:15.360
 And also the other problem is that

00:52:15.360 --> 00:52:16.720
 it has to go through a projector gate,

00:52:16.720 --> 00:52:18.320
 obviously reels of film, you know,

00:52:18.320 --> 00:52:19.520
 balanced on a projector,

00:52:19.520 --> 00:52:21.840
 pushing it through the projector's gate creates friction.

00:52:21.840 --> 00:52:22.800
 Guess what that does?

00:52:22.800 --> 00:52:24.400
 Frequently sets it on fire.

00:52:24.400 --> 00:52:28.080
 And also, the substance it's made of, "Nitrate" film,

00:52:28.080 --> 00:52:31.120
 it produces more oxygen as it burns,

00:52:31.120 --> 00:52:33.440
 which adds to the flame.

00:52:33.440 --> 00:52:35.680
 It can keep burning even if you put it underwater.

00:52:35.680 --> 00:52:39.680
 It's staggering that any of this stuff

00:52:39.680 --> 00:52:40.880
 is even left on the planet.

00:52:40.880 --> 00:52:42.000
 It's so unstable.

00:52:42.000 --> 00:52:44.160
 It just doesn't want to exist in a stable form.

00:52:44.160 --> 00:52:47.760
 - So one movie that was destroyed in the 1920s

00:52:47.760 --> 00:52:49.280
 was a movie called "Humorisk,"

00:52:49.280 --> 00:52:51.840
 which was a movie that was the only silent movie

00:52:51.840 --> 00:52:52.800
 of the Marx brothers.

00:52:52.800 --> 00:52:54.960
 And this is before they went into talkies themselves.

00:52:54.960 --> 00:52:57.200
 And it was destroyed on purpose

00:52:57.200 --> 00:52:59.760
 because Groucho Marx hated it so much

00:52:59.760 --> 00:53:02.400
 that he bought up the film and he burnt it

00:53:02.400 --> 00:53:03.760
 so that no one could ever see it again.

00:53:03.760 --> 00:53:06.640
 And you always hear of artists who dream of that scenario,

00:53:06.640 --> 00:53:09.760
 being able to go and remove from the shelves.

00:53:09.760 --> 00:53:12.080
 George Lucas did a Christmas special for "Star Wars."

00:53:12.080 --> 00:53:14.960
 His dream is to sledgehammer every single copy

00:53:14.960 --> 00:53:16.560
 out of existence, and no one can.

00:53:16.560 --> 00:53:18.240
 But Groucho Marx managed it.

00:53:18.240 --> 00:53:20.240
 - He got rid of history. - That's amazing.

00:53:20.240 --> 00:53:20.880
 Wow.

00:53:20.880 --> 00:53:23.040
 That's like, I mean, this is off topic.

00:53:23.040 --> 00:53:24.560
 We're just thinking of people who hate the film,

00:53:24.560 --> 00:53:26.240
 say, produced and wish they were destroyed.

00:53:26.240 --> 00:53:28.000
 I remember reading an interview with Patrick Stewart

00:53:28.000 --> 00:53:30.880
 who said that his biggest regret was doing a film

00:53:30.880 --> 00:53:32.720
 called "Wild Geese 2."

00:53:32.720 --> 00:53:34.800
 And he said the only reason he took the role

00:53:34.800 --> 00:53:36.880
 is because he was offered the exact same amount of money

00:53:36.880 --> 00:53:39.680
 for it as a repair for a window in his house

00:53:39.680 --> 00:53:40.960
 had just been quoted.

00:53:40.960 --> 00:53:42.880
 I don't know what kind of windows he's got.

00:53:42.880 --> 00:53:44.320
 - Nice windows. - Yeah.

00:53:46.080 --> 00:53:48.480
 Oh, my God. The guy who was his glazier

00:53:48.480 --> 00:53:50.400
 must have been just like Steven Spielberg

00:53:50.400 --> 00:53:52.560
 in a mustache or something that he's like, "Yeah."

00:53:52.560 --> 00:53:53.920
 Yeah.

00:53:53.920 --> 00:53:56.800
 This will cost you $13.6 million.

00:53:56.800 --> 00:54:02.800
 Do you guys know when the last silent movie star died?

00:54:02.800 --> 00:54:06.080
 Well, how do we define silent movie star?

00:54:06.080 --> 00:54:07.920
 Because, for instance, the guy and the artist,

00:54:07.920 --> 00:54:09.280
 that was a silent movie, wasn't it?

00:54:09.280 --> 00:54:12.800
 Oh, I'm not counting Jean Dujard down as a silent movie star.

00:54:12.800 --> 00:54:13.520
 No way.

00:54:13.520 --> 00:54:16.320
 Sorry. Last person from the original silent movie.

00:54:16.320 --> 00:54:17.200
 Who was enlightened to them?

00:54:17.200 --> 00:54:18.800
 I would have said they were probably...

00:54:18.800 --> 00:54:20.880
 They became talkies in the '20s, didn't they?

00:54:20.880 --> 00:54:22.000
 Is that one of that?

00:54:22.000 --> 00:54:25.840
 So, let's say someone was 10 when that came out

00:54:25.840 --> 00:54:27.840
 and they died when they were 100.

00:54:27.840 --> 00:54:30.240
 - Then I was... - Yeah, possibly a couple of years ago.

00:54:30.240 --> 00:54:30.960
 Yeah.

00:54:30.960 --> 00:54:34.800
 Yeah, I'm going to say there was a kid

00:54:34.800 --> 00:54:38.080
 who played the kid in the movie "The Kid."

00:54:38.080 --> 00:54:42.560
 No, but did you not see the prequel to that?

00:54:42.560 --> 00:54:43.200
 "The Fetus."

00:54:43.200 --> 00:54:47.680
 Lon Chaney played "The Fetus," I believe.

00:54:47.680 --> 00:54:51.920
 Yeah, he built himself an entire womb.

00:54:51.920 --> 00:54:54.320
 Amazing.

00:54:54.320 --> 00:54:56.880
 But Jackie Coogan was in that movie, "The Kid,"

00:54:56.880 --> 00:54:59.440
 and I'm going to say him.

00:54:59.440 --> 00:55:01.760
 He was uncle Fester in the Adams family as well.

00:55:01.760 --> 00:55:03.040
 He died in the '80s.

00:55:03.040 --> 00:55:06.080
 Okay. So, all right.

00:55:06.080 --> 00:55:08.480
 So, James and Anna are saying the last couple of years,

00:55:08.480 --> 00:55:10.000
 and you're saying the '80s, don't you?

00:55:10.000 --> 00:55:11.680
 James and Anna are closer. It's 2020.

00:55:12.640 --> 00:55:17.040
 "Baby Peggy" was her name, not her forever.

00:55:17.040 --> 00:55:19.040
 She had lost the baby element.

00:55:19.040 --> 00:55:20.160
 Actually, she had lost the Peggy element.

00:55:20.160 --> 00:55:20.880
 She changed her name.

00:55:20.880 --> 00:55:23.600
 But she was so famous.

00:55:23.600 --> 00:55:26.160
 She was one of the highest-paid movie stars in the entire 1920s,

00:55:26.160 --> 00:55:28.400
 which was a gold rush time in Hollywood.

00:55:28.400 --> 00:55:29.920
 She was so famous, she was the mascot

00:55:29.920 --> 00:55:33.920
 of the 1924 Democratic Convention in New York.

00:55:33.920 --> 00:55:34.480
 Wow.

00:55:34.480 --> 00:55:36.240
 She turned up on stage next to...

00:55:36.240 --> 00:55:37.680
 Not sure who it was. Ruth fell to someone.

00:55:37.680 --> 00:55:41.200
 And that was back in the days of silent conventions, wasn't it?

00:55:41.200 --> 00:55:44.720
 Yeah. Oh, for those days again.

00:55:44.720 --> 00:55:49.600
 The last adult man to be in a silent movie

00:55:49.600 --> 00:55:50.800
 was a guy called Shep Horton.

00:55:50.800 --> 00:55:52.560
 And he only died in 2017.

00:55:52.560 --> 00:55:54.000
 And he was in silent movies.

00:55:54.000 --> 00:55:55.120
 Shep Horton.

00:55:55.120 --> 00:55:55.840
 Shep Horton.

00:55:55.840 --> 00:55:57.520
 Yeah, H-O-U-G-H.

00:55:57.520 --> 00:56:00.480
 But he was called "The Last of the Great Nobodies".

00:56:00.480 --> 00:56:03.360
 Incredible.

00:56:03.360 --> 00:56:05.360
 So, he was in hundreds of films.

00:56:05.360 --> 00:56:07.280
 He was in "Gone with the Wind", "The Big Sleep",

00:56:07.280 --> 00:56:08.640
 "Cleopatra", "Wizard of Oz",

00:56:08.640 --> 00:56:11.360
 but always just as a kind of handsome dude

00:56:11.360 --> 00:56:12.080
 in the background.

00:56:12.080 --> 00:56:14.640
 But you can see him in all of these films.

00:56:14.640 --> 00:56:16.080
 They've tracked loads of the movies he's in.

00:56:16.080 --> 00:56:17.440
 He was in a dozen films a month.

00:56:17.440 --> 00:56:19.600
 I know.

00:56:19.600 --> 00:56:21.280
 You feel like he definitely, when he...

00:56:21.280 --> 00:56:22.160
 That was on his CV.

00:56:22.160 --> 00:56:24.000
 He coughed over the last word, didn't he?

00:56:24.000 --> 00:56:28.400
 I'd say, "Well, they called me The Last of the Great Nobodies".

00:56:28.400 --> 00:56:33.360
 But after he died, they put his gravestone

00:56:33.360 --> 00:56:35.680
 in a pile of other gravestone of "Nobody's".

00:56:36.480 --> 00:56:37.040
 Hi.

00:56:37.040 --> 00:56:41.120
 Okay, that's it.

00:56:41.120 --> 00:56:42.160
 That is all of our facts.

00:56:42.160 --> 00:56:43.600
