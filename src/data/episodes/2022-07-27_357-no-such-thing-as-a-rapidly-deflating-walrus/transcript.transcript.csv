00:00:13,00:00:19,"Hello and welcome to another episode of No Such Thing as a Fish, a weekly podcast coming to"
00:00:19,00:00:25,"you from four undisclosed locations in the UK. My name is Dan Schreiber, I am sitting here with"
00:00:25,00:00:30,"Anna Tyshinski, James Harkin and Andrew Hunter Murray and once again we have gathered round our"
00:00:30,00:00:35,"microphones with our four favourite facts from the last seven days and in no particular order,"
00:00:35,00:00:43,"here we go. Starting with you, Anna. My fact this week is that in 2016 Tupperware claimed to be"
00:00:43,00:00:53,holding a party summer in the world every 1.3 seconds. Bullshit! No! How's that possible?
00:00:53,00:00:59,You're just not being invited and I know this is awkward. This is Tupperware parties. The reason
00:00:59,00:01:03,"I'm researching this is because I was talking to my mum a couple of weeks ago and she said,"
00:01:03,00:01:07,"""I wonder if anyone goes to Tupperware parties anymore?"" And I said, ""What on earth are you"
00:01:07,00:01:12,"talking about?"" And then she was saying about, you know, how in their youths you'd have Tupperware"
00:01:12,00:01:19,"parties and they are a thing where a Tupperware salesperson, sales rep, basically throws a house"
00:01:19,00:01:24,party where they demonstrate and display all sorts of Tupperware and it's still really popular
00:01:24,00:01:29,"around the world. So they stopped happening in the UK in 2003, but they happen in lots of other"
00:01:29,00:01:35,countries still. Every 1.3 seconds you could be at one. They make extraordinary claims. So they
00:01:35,00:01:39,"claim that France has half a million Tupperware parties every year, which how many people go to"
00:01:39,00:01:46,"a Tupperware party would you say? Is it 10? Yeah, 8 to 10. These days none. Like it must have been"
00:01:46,00:01:52,"a bad year for Tupperware sales last year. Okay, so France has half a million Tupperware parties"
00:01:52,00:01:57,"each with, let's say, 10 people attending. That's still 5 million French people. No, it isn't."
00:01:57,00:02:00,"You're not saying that you only go to one Tupperware party every year and it's like, ""Nope,"
00:02:00,00:02:05,"that's my fill for the year."" These Tupperware enthusiasts are going to more than one party."
00:02:05,00:02:10,"That's true. And also there are Tupperware raves, which can get really out of control quite a"
00:02:10,00:02:16,"little. They're illegal at the moment, but... You have to bring your drugs in a totally sized Tupperware"
00:02:16,00:02:21,"labelled. It is amazing the Tupperware story. So as you said, that's how they actually sell"
00:02:21,00:02:27,"Tupperware and it started off not being very successful. So it was invented by Earl Tupper,"
00:02:27,00:02:34,not an Earl. That's just his name. I think it was 1946 and didn't sell very well. And then this
00:02:34,00:02:41,woman called Brownie Wise came along with a wise attitude towards PR. And she was already selling
00:02:41,00:02:46,"various household goods via the house party. And she bought up some Tupperware, sold it,"
00:02:46,00:02:52,and he spotted that she was causing a massive increase in sales this way. And I think within
00:02:52,00:02:58,"three years of her being on the scene, he took all his products off shelves and sold them exclusively"
00:02:58,00:03:03,"at parties. And five years after she came on the scene, the company was making $100 million"
00:03:03,00:03:10,in sales per year. Wow. She absolutely smashed it. Yeah. She found out that whenever you put like
00:03:10,00:03:14,"some gravy in a Tupperware box and threw it across the room, she always got way more sales."
00:03:14,00:03:19,"That was the pièce de résistance, wasn't it? Bouncing the Tupperware across the room."
00:03:19,00:03:24,"The gravy frisbee. It's mad as well, isn't it, that this feels like, again, there's probably"
00:03:24,00:03:28,"other research to suggest otherwise. But to me, it feels like this is the moment where we accepted"
00:03:28,00:03:32,"plastic into the house. So that's what they were fighting against, largely. Plastic wasn't a thing"
00:03:32,00:03:37,that you brought into the house. And a lot of people were very resistant to it. So it's so odd
00:03:37,00:03:42,"to know that in my head, at least, this is the moment where all of this now, all the plastic in"
00:03:42,00:03:45,our house is off the back of these parties that were happening with Brownie Wise in America.
00:03:45,00:03:47,Interesting idea. I like that.
00:03:47,00:03:49,"Diane lives in a child's Wendy house, we should say at this point."
00:03:49,00:03:53,He's got his little cozy coupe car in the corner.
00:03:53,00:03:59,"Speaking of the actual Tupperware parties, have you heard of the parties they used to have at"
00:04:00,00:04:05,"Tupperware HQ? No, that sounded wild. So these, again, were Brownie Wise's idea. It was called"
00:04:05,00:04:10,"Homecoming Jubilee. And it was for hundreds of the Tupperware sales women who were, I think"
00:04:10,00:04:15,"they were exclusively women who were selling the products in the home. So they had these, like,"
00:04:15,00:04:18,"mad, orgiastic, not quite orgiastic, but they were pretty funky."
00:04:18,00:04:26,"And they were so far from orgiastic. No, no, no, no. What about this? 1954's big Tupperware rave"
00:04:26,00:04:31,was called a big dig. A big what? Sorry. A big dig. All right. So did it.
00:04:31,00:04:40,"She buried $50,000 worth of minx dolls, diamond rings, gold watches, and tiny model cars around"
00:04:40,00:04:45,"the place at Tupperware HQ. And you had to go and dig them up. And if you found a tiny model car,"
00:04:45,00:04:51,"you could swap it for an actual car. I mean, it sounds insane. And they had Methodist preachers"
00:04:51,00:04:56,"come and say that Tupperware was a way of fighting communism. They had a Walk of Fame,"
00:04:56,00:05:02,which was just Tupperware sales women on the Walk of Fame. They had a 40 foot mural called
00:05:02,00:05:06,the Museum of Dishes. They had a pond where apparently she baptized people.
00:05:06,00:05:10,"Yeah, I haven't been exactly clear on why she was baptising people."
00:05:10,00:05:16,"They did. They did say, though, that Brownie Wise had a sort of religious aura to her, didn't she?"
00:05:16,00:05:21,She sort of was treated as a sort of high priest of the Tupperware religion at that time.
00:05:22,00:05:29,"And she used to go around with the original slag, polyethylene slag that Earl Tupper had used,"
00:05:29,00:05:34,"and she would allow people to stroke it and touch the slag, the sacred slag."
00:05:34,00:05:38,"I said it was orgiastic. And if you're touching the sacred slag,"
00:05:38,00:05:41,"Brian, you should say what slag is. Yeah."
00:05:41,00:05:49,"Well, it's polyethylene, isn't it? It's like a plastic, it's like a black plastic mold."
00:05:50,00:05:53,It's the plastic which the Tupperware was eventually made out of.
00:05:53,00:05:59,"So he was given one of these big lumps of cast-off plastic from another company,"
00:05:59,00:06:04,and he used a process to turn it into this kind of see-through plastic container thing.
00:06:04,00:06:09,"And he kept the original version of it and then gave it to Brownie Wise, didn't he?"
00:06:09,00:06:10,So cool.
00:06:10,00:06:14,"And she said, just get your fingers on it, wish for what you want,"
00:06:14,00:06:19,"know it's going to come true, and then get out and work like everything, and it will."
00:06:20,00:06:23,"It is starting to sound more and more orgiastic, some of this language."
00:06:23,00:06:24,Sort of it.
00:06:24,00:06:26,They had a wishing well at company headquarters.
00:06:26,00:06:28,"That's sort of what you were saying, James, about the wishes."
00:06:28,00:06:31,"They had a wishing well, and that's the point,"
00:06:31,00:06:33,"you throw wishes into the wishing well, don't you, if there is a wishing well."
00:06:33,00:06:38,And they got a wish fairy to come and dole out expensive gifts to the Tupperware ladies.
00:06:38,00:06:38,Did she live in the well?
00:06:38,00:06:44,It's unclear. I guess she lived in some Tupperware somewhere.
00:06:44,00:06:46,That would be cool.
00:06:46,00:06:49,Do you know the thing of someone bursting out of a cake?
00:06:49,00:06:50,Yeah.
00:06:50,00:06:52,They must have had someone bursting out of some Tupperware at one of these parties.
00:06:52,00:06:55,"I doubt it, because I think the whole point of Tupperware is that it doesn't"
00:06:55,00:06:57,open without quite a lot of force.
00:06:57,00:07:02,So you just basically got some asphyxiated woman in a plastic container.
00:07:02,00:07:05,"That's a good advert, though."
00:07:05,00:07:09,"I mean, it's so secure that if your life depends on it, you can't escape."
00:07:09,00:07:14,"One of the things they did just on that subject is they did something called carrot calling,"
00:07:14,00:07:18,"which what would happen is you'd go to your party and then you'd get some Tupperware,"
00:07:18,00:07:21,"and then you'd put some carrots in your Tupperware,"
00:07:21,00:07:24,"and then you'd put some just on the shelf wherever you keep it or in the fridge,"
00:07:24,00:07:26,if you're a weirdo that keeps your carrots in the fridge.
00:07:26,00:07:30,"And then they would say, OK, well, let's come back in a month's time"
00:07:30,00:07:33,and see how the carrots look that were in your Tupperware
00:07:33,00:07:36,"compared to the ones that are on your shelf or on your pantry, right?"
00:07:36,00:07:40,"And so that was not only a way of proving how good the Tupperware was,"
00:07:40,00:07:44,but it was a way of making sure the same people came back to your party to buy more shit.
00:07:44,00:07:45,So it was pretty clever.
00:07:45,00:07:47,That's really clever.
00:07:48,00:07:53,Just one thing about Tupperware that I found bizarre is that a third of its revenue comes
00:07:53,00:08:00,"from makeup sales. Tupperware makeup. And in fact, in South America, it's more than half."
00:08:00,00:08:05,"In Uruguay, 70%. And I could go on."
00:08:05,00:08:07,"In parts of Uruguay, 90%."
00:08:07,00:08:13,"There's one house in Uruguay, which is 100% Tupperware makeup."
00:08:13,00:08:16,What is the makeup? Is it a famous brand?
00:08:17,00:08:20,So they bought up a bunch of beauty brands in the early 2000s.
00:08:20,00:08:22,"And this is when the guy who was running the company at the time,"
00:08:22,00:08:27,"I think it was a guy called Rick Goings, he realized that in South America,"
00:08:27,00:08:31,he ran some stats and realized that people spent much more on makeup than they did on food containers.
00:08:31,00:08:35,He said that he checked something called the Vanity Index.
00:08:35,00:08:39,And South American countries rate most highly in terms of people who care most about their appearance.
00:08:39,00:08:43,And so they launched makeup there instead. And it's super popular.
00:08:43,00:08:47,"I suppose like you would have Avon parties in the UK, wouldn't you?"
00:08:47,00:08:49,Like who would sell makeup and stuff like that.
00:08:49,00:08:54,"And Sommers parties, I think used to be a thing."
00:08:54,00:08:57,"Yeah, definitely a thing, wasn't they?"
00:08:57,00:09:01,"I think there was an article which claimed that there were 4,000 and Sommers parties every week."
00:09:01,00:09:02,Every second.
00:09:02,00:09:10,"They had a falling out, didn't they, in the end, Earl and Brownie."
00:09:10,00:09:12,The two combined geniuses.
00:09:12,00:09:15,So Earl was sort of the inventive genius and she was the PR genius.
00:09:15,00:09:19,And he thought that it should be more about Tupperware and less about her.
00:09:19,00:09:21,And it was becoming quite about her.
00:09:21,00:09:24,She was the first woman ever to appear on the cover of Business Week.
00:09:24,00:09:27,"She, because of her fame as this Tupperware Queen,"
00:09:27,00:09:30,she ended up writing this self-help book called Best Wishes.
00:09:30,00:09:36,"And Earl Tupper eventually thought, no, she's becoming too self-involved and a hungry for fame."
00:09:36,00:09:41,And he fired her in 1958 and sold the company shortly afterwards.
00:09:41,00:09:44,"I read, and I don't know, I think there's a lot of speculation"
00:09:44,00:09:46,because we don't fully know the details of the falling out.
00:09:46,00:09:50,"But there were a few rumours that he thought that once he passed away,"
00:09:50,00:09:54,"if the business went to Brownie, it would go down because no one would want"
00:09:54,00:09:58,"a woman at the head of a company, which sounds mad,"
00:09:58,00:10:00,but apparently part of his thinking.
00:10:00,00:10:02,"I mean, there's a lot of rumours."
00:10:02,00:10:03,It's very strange.
00:10:03,00:10:11,"I read one that in 1957, she had held a massive Tupperware party on a Florida island for 1,200 people."
00:10:11,00:10:16,And there was a torrential thunderstorm which injured 21 people and that led to lots of lawsuits.
00:10:16,00:10:22,And so this is the most charitable explanation of why she was fired is that that was a big mistake.
00:10:22,00:10:26,But it does seem like it was quite a lot to do with Tupper's ego.
00:10:26,00:10:31,"And in fact, there's more evidence because she used to bury things on Tupperware HQ property."
00:10:31,00:10:38,"Once she had been sacked, he had a whole dug on Tupperware company property"
00:10:38,00:10:43,and dumped 600 copies of her book into the hole and buried them.
00:10:43,00:10:44,Wow.
00:10:44,00:10:47,That wasn't so he could throw a big party where people got to dig on her book.
00:10:47,00:10:50,It was not.
00:10:50,00:10:53,Did he put it in Tupperware or is it just into the ground?
00:10:53,00:10:56,I think the point was not to preserve the copies of the book for future generations.
00:10:56,00:10:59,I was just thinking he would have shot himself in the foot there with that idea.
00:10:59,00:11:01,"He did go a bit strange afterwards, didn't he?"
00:11:01,00:11:04,"He, what did he do?"
00:11:04,00:11:06,He moved to Costa Rica.
00:11:06,00:11:08,"He basically sold the company, got a whole load of money."
00:11:08,00:11:10,He didn't want it to get taxed.
00:11:10,00:11:15,And so divorced his wife and went to live in Costa Rica and so he did.
00:11:15,00:11:19,"Although before that he bought an island, which I think he wanted to live on."
00:11:19,00:11:22,"He bought this island called San Jose Island, which I'd never heard of."
00:11:22,00:11:24,It's just off the coast of Panama.
00:11:24,00:11:27,And he wanted it to become a holiday resort.
00:11:27,00:11:29,"And that makes him sound very Richard Branson,"
00:11:29,00:11:32,but I think it was an island that didn't really have people on it
00:11:32,00:11:34,and probably didn't cost a huge amount.
00:11:34,00:11:36,And so he wanted it to be this glorious resort.
00:11:36,00:11:37,And it looks stunning.
00:11:37,00:11:40,"And I've seen pictures, golden sand beaches."
00:11:40,00:11:44,He hadn't investigated it enough because it had been the site of massive chemical weapons testing
00:11:44,00:11:48,"and dumps by the US, Canada and Britain in the 1940s."
00:11:48,00:11:50,So he sent a couple of staff there.
00:11:50,00:11:53,They got quite badly burned and damaged from that.
00:11:53,00:11:55,And they realized that it was uninhabitable.
00:11:55,00:11:56,That's bad luck.
00:11:56,00:11:59,He was an amazing ideas man from what I can tell.
00:11:59,00:12:04,There's a lot of inventions that he tried to make that never ended up being
00:12:04,00:12:06,"realized, which I think is a bit of a shame."
00:12:06,00:12:11,"He had the no drip ice cream cone, which that's a great idea, isn't it?"
00:12:11,00:12:13,It's a great idea.
00:12:13,00:12:13,Yeah.
00:12:13,00:12:16,"It's one of the only problem with ice cream cones, really."
00:12:16,00:12:16,Yeah.
00:12:16,00:12:18,"Actually, you know what I would invent?"
00:12:18,00:12:21,"You know, the best thing about an ice cream cone is where you snap off the bottom"
00:12:21,00:12:24,"of the ice cream cone and you turn it into a tiny little ice cream,"
00:12:24,00:12:27,tiny kind of microcosm of itself.
00:12:27,00:12:28,Do you know that?
00:12:28,00:12:31,So you snap off the bottom of an ice cream cone.
00:12:31,00:12:33,So you have a tiny little bit of cone.
00:12:33,00:12:36,And then you take a tiny little bit of ice cream from the top of it.
00:12:36,00:12:39,And it can be like you're a giant because you have a tiny ice cream.
00:12:39,00:12:43,"Well, you could resell it to other kids around you and make back your money."
00:12:43,00:12:47,But then I would invent one where they kept re-growing the bottom
00:12:47,00:12:49,so you could do that an infinite amount of time.
00:12:49,00:12:51,That's weird because I do.
00:12:51,00:12:52,So do you not do the thing where you snap off the bottom
00:12:52,00:12:54,and then you suck the ice cream out through the tube?
00:12:54,00:12:55,That's what I do.
00:12:55,00:12:58,"Ah, well, you could do both of those things if you, you know."
00:12:58,00:12:59,Yeah.
00:12:59,00:12:59,Yeah.
00:12:59,00:13:00,You're all mad in different ways.
00:13:00,00:13:03,These are not acceptable ways to get.
00:13:03,00:13:06,As he stands next to the ice cream van and tells the children
00:13:06,00:13:08,what they're allowed to do and what they're not allowed to do.
00:13:08,00:13:12,I've got my tray in front of me to catch any spare drops.
00:13:12,00:13:16,You thought the ice cream van man was scary.
00:13:16,00:13:20,How about the creepy guy standing next to me catching our droplets?
00:13:20,00:13:26,A couple of other inventions by Earl Tupper.
00:13:26,00:13:30,Fishing poles that wade your catch as you were reeling it in.
00:13:31,00:13:31,Great idea.
00:13:31,00:13:35,He invented a machine to make it easier to clean and dress chickens.
00:13:35,00:13:37,And dress.
00:13:37,00:13:41,"I imagine dress as in for cooking, not as in putting trousers on them or something."
00:13:41,00:13:44,"Andy, did you read this one?"
00:13:44,00:13:46,"Because I can't, I can't work out what it would be."
00:13:46,00:13:47,A fish powered boat.
00:13:47,00:13:49,I didn't read that.
00:13:49,00:13:52,That was one where the idea is you get a really big fish
00:13:52,00:13:55,and you attach it to the bottom of your boat.
00:13:55,00:13:59,And then the fish swims along the river and just pulls your boat along with it.
00:13:59,00:14:01,The boat is directly above the fish.
00:14:01,00:14:02,"Yeah, yeah."
00:14:02,00:14:03,Is that real?
00:14:03,00:14:04,"Well, just one fish."
00:14:04,00:14:06,None of these are really real.
00:14:06,00:14:06,A lot of them.
00:14:06,00:14:08,"I wonder if the concept was real, right?"
00:14:08,00:14:08,Sure.
00:14:08,00:14:13,"I mean, they were written in like his notebooks from when he was a teenager."
00:14:13,00:14:14,Some of these.
00:14:14,00:14:17,"So I think they were, oh, I mean, they were ideas."
00:14:17,00:14:21,But I don't think he ever really thought that we were going to take a load of boats
00:14:21,00:14:22,and attach fish to the bottom of them.
00:14:22,00:14:27,"This, that could be the green energy solution that we're all looking for."
00:14:27,00:14:28,It could be.
00:14:28,00:14:29,That's what we want to do.
00:14:29,00:14:31,Like stress the fish out a bit more.
00:14:31,00:14:31,Yeah.
00:14:31,00:14:35,"It makes sense, though, the invention of a fish weighing rod,"
00:14:35,00:14:37,because you need to make sure you're really in a big fish
00:14:37,00:14:40,if it's planning to drag your ferry over the tunnel.
00:14:40,00:14:50,"OK, it is time for fact number two, and that is Andy."
00:14:50,00:14:55,"My fact is that in 1868, there were five different plays on in London's West End"
00:14:55,00:14:59,simultaneously where a train burst onto the stage and threatened to run somebody over.
00:14:59,00:15:04,This was an huge theatrical trend.
00:15:04,00:15:05,So I've got the names of the plays.
00:15:05,00:15:08,They were called Land Rats and Water Rats.
00:15:08,00:15:08,That's one play.
00:15:08,00:15:15,"Rail, River and Road, Danger, After Dark, and my favorite, The Scamps of London."
00:15:15,00:15:16,Great sounding play.
00:15:16,00:15:22,"And in all of these plays, there was a train drama scene where a train burst on."
00:15:22,00:15:27,"And the trains were obviously, you know, quite detailed wooden flats that were mounted on rails."
00:15:27,00:15:30,So they did they were able to burst onto the stage.
00:15:30,00:15:34,Lots of kind of sound effects and smoke and stuff.
00:15:34,00:15:36,"Yeah, exactly."
00:15:36,00:15:38,And this was a massive thing.
00:15:38,00:15:41,And I think it was because of a play the previous year called Under the Gaslight.
00:15:41,00:15:46,Although it was in that was the first time it was really big on stage.
00:15:46,00:15:48,"The guy who wrote it, he was called Augustine Daly."
00:15:48,00:15:50,And he claimed that other people had nicked his idea.
00:15:50,00:15:52,"And then other people said, no, you nicked this from somewhere."
00:15:52,00:15:56,"Well, he was he won the court case."
00:15:56,00:16:00,So I think technically we have to say that it was his idea.
00:16:00,00:16:01,He's not going to say.
00:16:01,00:16:08,"He claimed that he was just walking down the road and he tripped up over like a piece of,"
00:16:08,00:16:09,"you know, pavements or something."
00:16:09,00:16:12,And he hurt his toe and had to hop all the way home.
00:16:12,00:16:17,"And when he landed back in his bed, it just appeared to him the idea from nowhere."
00:16:17,00:16:20,As opposed to the fact that there was actually already an idea out there.
00:16:20,00:16:21,"Yeah, the weirdest."
00:16:21,00:16:26,We actually have his first hand quotes from that moment.
00:16:26,00:16:27,And it breeds so bizarre.
00:16:27,00:16:31,"He says, I was near my door and I rushed into the house, threw myself into a chair,"
00:16:31,00:16:34,grasping my injured foot with both hands for the pain was great.
00:16:34,00:16:36,"And exclaiming over and over again, I've got it."
00:16:36,00:16:37,I've got it.
00:16:37,00:16:39,And it beats hot irons all to pieces.
00:16:39,00:16:42,"It's like, we should say this."
00:16:42,00:16:45,"Sorry, the idea that we're talking about is not the train crashing through though."
00:16:45,00:16:47,It's the person tied to a railway.
00:16:47,00:16:47,I did.
00:16:47,00:16:51,"So this was a meme in 1867,"
00:16:51,00:16:56,which began with this under the gaslight play where someone's tied to a train track
00:16:56,00:16:58,and a train's coming towards them at the very last minute.
00:16:58,00:16:59,You whip them away.
00:16:59,00:17:01,"And that was his genius idea, right?"
00:17:01,00:17:04,"By the way, the stubbing his toe had nothing to do with it."
00:17:04,00:17:05,It's bizarre.
00:17:05,00:17:07,He just happened to stub his toe at the same time.
00:17:07,00:17:08,The idea.
00:17:08,00:17:13,But this play was held at the Worrell Sisters New York City Theatre in 1867
00:17:13,00:17:15,and was absolutely massive.
00:17:16,00:17:20,"And it wasn't actually these days, I would say we would see that meme."
00:17:20,00:17:25,And it would be like a damsel in distress who was tied to the rail tracks.
00:17:25,00:17:29,And then some mustachioed hero would come and save the day.
00:17:29,00:17:33,"But in this case, it was actually the woman who saved the man."
00:17:33,00:17:35,There was a man in the play called Snorky.
00:17:35,00:17:39,And he was tied to the train tracks.
00:17:39,00:17:43,And then the woman protagonist would come and save the day.
00:17:43,00:17:45,"And then Snorky would exclaim,"
00:17:45,00:17:47,"""These are the women who ain't to have a vote."""
00:17:47,00:17:49,"Oh, really?"
00:17:49,00:17:50,Political.
00:17:50,00:17:52,So it's quite a political little thing.
00:17:52,00:17:56,But the play was run by these sisters called the Worrell Sisters.
00:17:56,00:17:58,And they were massive.
00:17:58,00:18:02,They were the daughters of a clown and kind of grew up in the showbiz.
00:18:02,00:18:06,And they kind of started doing these burlesque acts
00:18:06,00:18:09,where they would take the piss out of other plays and stuff like that.
00:18:09,00:18:14,And then eventually they did so well that they managed to buy their own theatre in New York City.
00:18:14,00:18:16,And that was where they put on this play.
00:18:16,00:18:19,And the most famous one of them was Jenny Worrell.
00:18:19,00:18:21,"And it was written of her that,"
00:18:21,00:18:23,"""The beautiful voluptuous Jenny Worrell,"
00:18:23,00:18:28,"subtlete, drank champagne, owned fast horses, wore diamonds,"
00:18:28,00:18:33,"squandered money to left and right until the public grew weary of her."""
00:18:33,00:18:36,So and then she died in poverty in the end.
00:18:36,00:18:37,So it's not a fun story.
00:18:37,00:18:39,"But unfortunately, she was also the daughter of a clown."
00:18:39,00:18:44,So she had size 64 shoes and that made it very hard to socialise.
00:18:44,00:18:45,"I do think when Snorky says,"
00:18:45,00:18:47,"""And these are the women to wait to have a vote,"""
00:18:47,00:18:51,"it's slightly, like, did he believe in sufferage for women"
00:18:51,00:18:54,before a woman saved him from a railway track?
00:18:54,00:18:56,"Sometimes you need that moment of clarity,"
00:18:56,00:18:59,like stubbing Yotto or being saved from a train.
00:18:59,00:19:02,I think no one should have the vote
00:19:02,00:19:04,unless they can prove that they've saved someone else's life.
00:19:04,00:19:10,"It's quite similar to just in the case of it switching,"
00:19:10,00:19:12,"and it used to be a woman who saved a man,"
00:19:12,00:19:15,"the first known cliffhanger, literal cliffhanger,"
00:19:15,00:19:18,"was in Thomas Hardy's A Pair of Blue Eyes, wasn't it, in 1873."
00:19:18,00:19:21,And so this was really the age of the cliffhanger.
00:19:21,00:19:23,"That's what that train scene is,"
00:19:23,00:19:25,is because it's the very last minute when they escape.
00:19:25,00:19:27,"Was this a novel, Anna, or did he write plays as well?"
00:19:27,00:19:29,"Yes, no, this was a novel, A Pair of Blue Eyes."
00:19:29,00:19:31,"And it features Henry Knight, who's the hero,"
00:19:31,00:19:33,and he's left dangling off the edge of a cliff.
00:19:33,00:19:36,"And then the whole book is him dangling,"
00:19:36,00:19:39,at which point he reviews the entire history of the world
00:19:39,00:19:40,whilst waiting to be rescued.
00:19:41,00:19:42,And that's the book.
00:19:42,00:19:46,"And then at the end, I believe his love interest pops up,"
00:19:46,00:19:48,and fashions are rope out of her own underwear
00:19:48,00:19:50,to haul him to safety.
00:19:50,00:19:53,"Wow, luckily she just came back from a land summits party."
00:19:53,00:19:57,"Yes, it was very flimsy, it snapped immediately,"
00:19:57,00:19:59,and he died tragically.
00:19:59,00:20:00,I can't believe after all the crap we got
00:20:00,00:20:03,for ruining the ending of another classic literature novel
00:20:03,00:20:07,that you've gone ahead and spoiled the ending of this Hardy one.
00:20:07,00:20:10,"Yeah, what was that, Anna Karenina?"
00:20:10,00:20:15,"Yeah, another book featuring, weirdly, a train which runs the road."
00:20:15,00:20:16,"Oh, God, no, please."
00:20:16,00:20:17,I need to hear that episode.
00:20:17,00:20:18,Stop listening.
00:20:18,00:20:23,"This sort of trend was Victorian melodrama, it gets called."
00:20:23,00:20:25,And it was a really big thing.
00:20:25,00:20:28,The idea was basically sensation.
00:20:28,00:20:32,"You had huge theatres, often with three or 4,000 seats in them."
00:20:32,00:20:35,And so theatres were engaged in an arms race
00:20:35,00:20:37,to come up with the most sensational stuff.
00:20:37,00:20:40,And a lot of them were thanks to a guy called Bruce Sensation
00:20:40,00:20:42,"Smith, have you heard of him?"
00:20:42,00:20:45,He came up with loads of amazing theatrical gimmicks.
00:20:45,00:20:48,So one of them is of a diver descending into the sea.
00:20:48,00:20:52,So that's what's happening in the story.
00:20:52,00:20:57,"But to show that, the boat he's in, that got lifted up into the flies."
00:20:57,00:20:59,So it looks like he's descending
00:20:59,00:21:01,because the boat is rising and rising above him.
00:21:01,00:21:05,But also then they revealed huge tanks of water behind him
00:21:05,00:21:07,which have real fish swimming in them.
00:21:07,00:21:11,"So as he descends, you see he is surrounded by actual fish."
00:21:11,00:21:12,That's so cool.
00:21:12,00:21:13,That's very cool.
00:21:13,00:21:16,Not everyone was that happy with these sensational plays.
00:21:16,00:21:20,So W.S. Gilbert of Gilbert and Sullivan fame.
00:21:20,00:21:22,"He said about these sensational plays,"
00:21:22,00:21:25,"""Every play which contains a house on fire, a sinking steamer,"
00:21:25,00:21:30,or a railway accident will succeed in spite of itself.
00:21:30,00:21:33,"In point of fact, nothing could wreck such a piece"
00:21:33,00:21:35,except carefully written dialogue
00:21:35,00:21:37,"or a strict attention to probability."""
00:21:37,00:21:41,"He said, ""Avoid these two stumbling blocks"
00:21:41,00:21:43,"and your piece will succeed triumphantly."""
00:21:43,00:21:45,Meow.
00:21:45,00:21:45,I know.
00:21:45,00:21:47,Ouch.
00:21:47,00:21:48,I think Dickens felt the same.
00:21:48,00:21:53,"Again, I think people would go to see the melodramatic moment"
00:21:53,00:21:56,"rather than any plot or dialogue or acting, wouldn't they?"
00:21:56,00:21:58,"And Dickens said of a play called ""The Streets of London"""
00:21:58,00:22:00,which had a city burning down in it.
00:22:00,00:22:02,And the name would change depending on what city it was in.
00:22:02,00:22:03,"So it would be ""The Streets of Bolton"""
00:22:03,00:22:04,when it went to Bolton.
00:22:04,00:22:06,"""The Streets of Glasgow."""
00:22:06,00:22:07,"And Dickens said of it,"
00:22:07,00:22:10,"""It's the most depressing instance without exception"
00:22:10,00:22:13,of an utterly degrading and debasing theatrical taste
00:22:13,00:22:16,"that has ever come under my writhing notice."""
00:22:16,00:22:17,Wow.
00:22:17,00:22:18,"Well, that's extraordinary."
00:22:18,00:22:21,"I guess it's just the equivalent of a blockbuster film though,"
00:22:21,00:22:24,"which you guys, you know, that there's an incredible scene"
00:22:24,00:22:26,where a plane disassembles itself or whatever.
00:22:26,00:22:29,"Yeah, it's a Dwayne Johnson movie, basically."
00:22:29,00:22:31,"Yeah, it's a Michael Bay movie."
00:22:31,00:22:32,"Yeah, I would have loved them."
00:22:32,00:22:35,"Imagine what Dickens would have thought of ""Transformers Fall."""
00:22:35,00:22:39,"There was like a response to it, wasn't there?"
00:22:39,00:22:41,"So in the 1850s and 1860s,"
00:22:41,00:22:43,there's a guy called Tom Robertson
00:22:43,00:22:46,"who invented a thing called ""Cup and Source of Realism."""
00:22:46,00:22:49,"And what that was, it was the exact opposite"
00:22:49,00:22:52,of these train crashes and fires and drownings
00:22:52,00:22:52,and stuff like that.
00:22:52,00:22:57,"And this was reported as being really, really unusual."
00:22:57,00:23:00,"If there were a few people talking in a kitchen, say,"
00:23:00,00:23:02,Robertson would put on stage as many chairs
00:23:02,00:23:06,"as would realistically be found in a kitchen or a dining room,"
00:23:06,00:23:08,"as opposed to everyone else who would say,"
00:23:08,00:23:11,"""Well, there are two people talking, so we only need two chairs."""
00:23:11,00:23:12,So we'll just put that.
00:23:12,00:23:14,So he had everything that was really realistic.
00:23:14,00:23:18,And there was one where someone was making a pudding on stage.
00:23:18,00:23:20,And this was absolutely the talk of the town
00:23:20,00:23:23,because it was so unusual that someone would really be
00:23:23,00:23:26,actually making a pudding while they were doing the talking.
00:23:26,00:23:30,And instead of kind of projecting and really shouting
00:23:30,00:23:32,"these kind of what was happening in the play,"
00:23:32,00:23:34,they would just talk as a normal person.
00:23:34,00:23:36,And it was just like a realistic thing.
00:23:36,00:23:38,"And to start off with, no one would put these plays on"
00:23:38,00:23:40,"because they were like, ""Well, where's the fucking car crash?"
00:23:40,00:23:43,"Where's the train crash? We don't have it."""
00:23:43,00:23:46,But eventually there was one or two theaters that did it.
00:23:46,00:23:48,"And then that's kind of where we are today a little bit, isn't it?"
00:23:48,00:23:50,"Sort of, except the chair thing."
00:23:50,00:23:53,I think the chair thing is still doesn't happen.
00:23:53,00:23:55,And that is revolutionary.
00:23:55,00:23:58,You do not see spare chairs in plays and that's bullshit.
00:23:58,00:23:59,You're right.
00:23:59,00:24:03,I was reading up on sort of general theater stage props
00:24:03,00:24:05,off the back of this fact.
00:24:05,00:24:07,And so just a couple of things that I found.
00:24:07,00:24:12,There was a story of Orson Welles when he used to be performing
00:24:12,00:24:13,in Julius Caesar.
00:24:13,00:24:16,He played the role of Brutus.
00:24:16,00:24:22,And he preferred a real knife because a plastic knife
00:24:22,00:24:25,didn't really give the proper shine in the theater lights.
00:24:25,00:24:28,"So when you have a real blade, it really bounces it off"
00:24:28,00:24:29,and makes it look real.
00:24:29,00:24:32,"Anyway, they had to take Julius Caesar to the hospital"
00:24:32,00:24:34,because he was stabbed by Orson Welles.
00:24:34,00:24:37,He collapsed.
00:24:37,00:24:38,Yeah.
00:24:38,00:24:41,"And yeah, the end of the scene he was taken to the hospital"
00:24:41,00:24:43,where he had to recover for quite a long time.
00:24:43,00:24:44,At the end of the scene.
00:24:44,00:24:48,I would say bring the scene to a close a little bit early.
00:24:48,00:24:50,"I think everyone's watching going,"
00:24:50,00:24:53,"bloody hell Julius Caesar is good in this, isn't he?"
00:24:53,00:24:57,Wow.
00:24:57,00:24:57,Yeah.
00:24:57,00:24:59,But doesn't he get stabbed about 40 times in the...
00:24:59,00:25:00,Because it loads of people.
00:25:00,00:25:01,"By lots of different people, though."
00:25:01,00:25:04,Presumably Orson Welles was the only one with a natural knife.
00:25:04,00:25:07,Everyone else was just doing the plastic thing.
00:25:07,00:25:10,Orson Welles was so devoted to his craft he handed out 40 knives
00:25:10,00:25:12,and he recruited his worst enemy to play Caesar.
00:25:12,00:25:15,Wow.
00:25:15,00:25:18,"Speaking of that, there was a production of Dad's Army"
00:25:18,00:25:20,in 2010 in South Wales.
00:25:20,00:25:22,Local production.
00:25:22,00:25:24,And they realised in a rehearsal that they were
00:25:24,00:25:27,accidentally using live grenades.
00:25:27,00:25:29,Which they have just found.
00:25:29,00:25:30,Don't panic.
00:25:30,00:25:34,And it was Corporal Jones who was the man who realised.
00:25:34,00:25:35,Oh my God.
00:25:35,00:25:35,"Yeah, I know."
00:25:35,00:25:36,Absolutely.
00:25:36,00:25:38,"And they realised as he was looking at it he thought,"
00:25:38,00:25:40,"""Oh, that's funny. This does look good, doesn't it?"""
00:25:40,00:25:42,"In fact, there's a pin still in it."
00:25:42,00:25:47,And they had found them in the garage of a cast member's father-in-law
00:25:47,00:25:49,and just driven them to the theatre rattling around.
00:25:49,00:25:51,And they had to call the bomb squad to come and blow them up.
00:25:51,00:25:52,"Oh, wow."
00:25:52,00:25:54,You know what they do for drugs in films?
00:25:54,00:25:58,Because in some films they have to take lots of drugs.
00:25:58,00:26:01,Is it like a flour or icing sugar or something?
00:26:01,00:26:02,I would have thought.
00:26:02,00:26:03,"Yeah, it's pretty close."
00:26:03,00:26:05,"So Propmasters, basically the ones,"
00:26:05,00:26:07,they have to test all the drugs themselves
00:26:07,00:26:08,to make sure that you can take it as an actor
00:26:08,00:26:10,and not immediately start choking or whatever.
00:26:10,00:26:14,"So fake cocaine in the Wolf of Wall Street,"
00:26:14,00:26:17,that I think was vitamin B powder.
00:26:17,00:26:17,And that was fine.
00:26:19,00:26:22,"They use moss instead of marijuana in films, which..."
00:26:22,00:26:24,Andy.
00:26:24,00:26:26,I imagine Andy going to his moss dealer
00:26:26,00:26:28,"and accidentally getting some marijuana and going,"
00:26:28,00:26:29,"""What's this bullshit?"""
00:26:29,00:26:33,I felt calmer and I wanted to feel tense.
00:26:33,00:26:36,"Yeah, magic mushrooms are just mushrooms."
00:26:36,00:26:39,"They just use some mushrooms, but non-magic mushrooms."
00:26:39,00:26:40,That makes sense.
00:26:40,00:26:40,It does.
00:26:40,00:26:44,One more thing about the sensational plays.
00:26:44,00:26:48,So there was rules about what you could show in the theatre
00:26:48,00:26:49,"and then they got slightly loosened,"
00:26:49,00:26:50,but you still had to pass things
00:26:50,00:26:52,through the law chamber in this office.
00:26:52,00:26:54,"And so in the 19th century,"
00:26:54,00:26:57,"in order to get things through the censors,"
00:26:57,00:27:00,"you wouldn't put swear words in, for instance."
00:27:00,00:27:02,You would have other things that people would say.
00:27:02,00:27:05,"And so you have loads of awesome insults,"
00:27:05,00:27:09,like people would call each other a rascally night hawk
00:27:09,00:27:12,or a herring-gutted villain and stuff like that.
00:27:13,00:27:18,"Also, sometimes, like a villain, instead of going,"
00:27:18,00:27:23,"""Fuck you, you bastard, you stopped my amazing plan,"""
00:27:23,00:27:24,they wouldn't be able to do any of that dialogue.
00:27:24,00:27:25,"You should write the scripts, actually,"
00:27:25,00:27:27,if that's what the script is.
00:27:27,00:27:28,That was stunning.
00:27:28,00:27:31,"Well, I would do if it could go back into the 19th century,"
00:27:31,00:27:34,"because instead of using that amazing dialogue,"
00:27:34,00:27:37,you would just shout out whatever your psychological state was.
00:27:37,00:27:40,"It was an American play, which was adapted for the British stage."
00:27:41,00:27:43,"And when the villain had his plans filed,"
00:27:43,00:27:46,"he just shouted out, ""Confusion!"""
00:27:46,00:27:53,"Dan, I think we have a new catchphrase for you on the podcast."
00:27:53,00:28:05,"Okay, it is time for fact number three, and that is James."
00:28:05,00:28:09,"Okay, my fact this week is that when it wants to sleep,"
00:28:09,00:28:14,a walrus will sometimes hook its tusks onto a small iceberg
00:28:14,00:28:16,and sleep while floating along in the water.
00:28:16,00:28:19,Isn't that cute?
00:28:19,00:28:22,"It's so cute, apart from the quite big, fat,"
00:28:22,00:28:27,"blubbery things and probably quite cold, and it's a cute idea."
00:28:27,00:28:27,It's still cute.
00:28:27,00:28:28,"It's there, so cute."
00:28:28,00:28:30,I think that's very cute.
00:28:30,00:28:31,Yeah.
00:28:31,00:28:33,"So a few places on the internet doubt this,"
00:28:33,00:28:36,"but I am pretty confident that it does sometimes happen, at least."
00:28:37,00:28:43,"There was a book by Francis H. Fay called Ecology and Biology of the Pacific Walrus,"
00:28:43,00:28:45,"where they write that, ""On numerous occasions,"
00:28:45,00:28:48,"I have seen walruses resting or sleeping in the water,"
00:28:48,00:28:50,"with their tusks hooked over the edge of the ice,"
00:28:50,00:28:53,their body laying either horizontally or vertically in the water.
00:28:53,00:28:56,"The tusks appear to function both as a prop for the head,"
00:28:56,00:28:58,"keeping the mouth and nostrils out of the water,"
00:28:58,00:29:02,"and as an anchor, preventing the animal from drifting away with the current."""
00:29:02,00:29:05,So it does seem like it does occasionally happen.
00:29:05,00:29:08,"It's not the only way they sleep, but from time to time, they will do this."
00:29:08,00:29:10,It's so sweet.
00:29:10,00:29:12,"They're very promiscuous sleepers, aren't they?"
00:29:12,00:29:13,What do you mean they have sex?
00:29:13,00:29:15,"No, I don't at all."
00:29:15,00:29:17,I just mean they'll sleep anywhere.
00:29:17,00:29:18,They'll sleep around.
00:29:18,00:29:21,"Yeah, literally around, as in different locations."
00:29:21,00:29:26,"Imagine if that was another meaning of that, the misunderstandings you would have."
00:29:26,00:29:27,That's what I've been saying for years.
00:29:27,00:29:28,"Yeah, yeah."
00:29:28,00:29:30,"When we're on tar, you always tell your wife,"
00:29:30,00:29:32,"""Oh, I've been sleeping around for the last two weeks."""
00:29:32,00:29:33,Absolutely.
00:29:33,00:29:39,But they sleep leaning over.
00:29:39,00:29:40,"If they're in captivity,"
00:29:40,00:29:43,"they'll just lean up against the edge of their pool and sleep there,"
00:29:43,00:29:46,"or they sleep on the bottom of the water as well, which is magical."
00:29:46,00:29:48,"But briefly, because otherwise they will die."
00:29:48,00:29:51,"That's the most common way they sleep is on the bottom of the water,"
00:29:51,00:29:54,"but then they come, like you say, wake up every now and then just to breathe."
00:29:54,00:29:58,It's every three minutes they have to come up to the surface.
00:29:58,00:29:59,Really?
00:29:59,00:30:01,"Yeah, it's just a nap, really, that they're having."
00:30:01,00:30:04,"But they can sleep up to 90 hours, can't they?"
00:30:04,00:30:06,So that's a hell of a...
00:30:06,00:30:09,"When they're doing the 19-hour sleep, they're somewhere much more comfortable."
00:30:09,00:30:14,"Yeah, that is like having such severe sleep apnea, really, isn't it?"
00:30:14,00:30:16,Is it just every three minutes?
00:30:16,00:30:18,"You're like, ""Oh, my God."""
00:30:18,00:30:19,"Yeah, but they can sleep for 19 hours,"
00:30:19,00:30:23,but they can also swim nonstop for 84 hours sometimes.
00:30:23,00:30:26,So they're just pretty hardcore.
00:30:26,00:30:31,Isn't that one of the longest that any animal is known to stay awake
00:30:31,00:30:32,in one go?
00:30:32,00:30:33,It's very unusual.
00:30:33,00:30:37,"So humans can stay awake that late, that long."
00:30:37,00:30:41,"But if you stay awake that long, you're going to do yourself some damage,"
00:30:41,00:30:45,and you basically have to have someone holding your eyes open the whole time.
00:30:45,00:30:47,"So it is possible, but it's really unusual,"
00:30:47,00:30:50,"but they actually do it semi-regularly, so..."
00:30:50,00:30:54,"Just actually how they manage to go up and down in the water is quite interesting, actually."
00:30:54,00:30:56,"So when they do wake up on the bottom and need to get to the top,"
00:30:56,00:31:00,"they've got pharyngeal pouches, which are these air sacs between"
00:31:00,00:31:04,"like sort of their throat and their chest around their sternum,"
00:31:04,00:31:08,"and they can hold 50 litres of air, which is about the same,"
00:31:08,00:31:12,"I realised, as four party balloons, which actually I was most surprised at"
00:31:12,00:31:14,how many litres of air a party balloon can take.
00:31:14,00:31:16,"Well, that's a lot though, isn't it?"
00:31:16,00:31:19,Because presumably it must blow up like a party balloon.
00:31:19,00:31:22,"Yes, you can actually see the little lumps, I think, can't you,"
00:31:22,00:31:25,"when they're inflated, and that takes them to the top,"
00:31:25,00:31:27,"and that means that they can bob up and down vertically,"
00:31:27,00:31:28,and I think they can sleep like that.
00:31:28,00:31:31,"Wait, hang on Anna, it doesn't take them up to the top."
00:31:31,00:31:34,"If they're at the bottom of the sea and they haven't remembered to inflate their pouches,"
00:31:34,00:31:36,"there's nothing they can do about that, there."
00:31:36,00:31:39,They use it to stay up when they're up.
00:31:39,00:31:40,"Yeah, sorry."
00:31:40,00:31:44,"When they breathe out, do they kind of fly around like a party balloon when you wake up?"
00:31:44,00:31:50,Sometimes you hear that squeaking farting sound when you're in the sea like that.
00:31:50,00:31:54,"Oh, that'd be terrifying, because they weigh over a tonne, some of them."
00:31:55,00:31:58,The one of those untethered in a room and flying around would do a lot of property damage.
00:31:58,00:32:06,"They can eat as many as 6,000 clams in a single feeding session, and I went on to-"
00:32:06,00:32:07,One walrus.
00:32:07,00:32:14,"Yeah, one walrus in one session, 6,000 clams, and I went on to the website of a seafood merchant"
00:32:14,00:32:20,"in Borough Market, and that would cost £15,000 per meal if they bought their welks and clams"
00:32:20,00:32:21,from Borough Market.
00:32:21,00:32:26,"I don't know what sort of lovey media walrus is you're thinking about, but Borough Market is"
00:32:26,00:32:28,an expensive place to buy your clams.
00:32:28,00:32:31,"They're so cool, they're so weird."
00:32:31,00:32:35,"Their skin is amazingly thick, obviously, because they need to keep warm in the water,"
00:32:35,00:32:39,"but their skin is four centimetres thick, which is about 30 times thicker than human skin."
00:32:39,00:32:43,"And then under that, they have another, is it 10 centimetres of blubber?"
00:32:43,00:32:45,"Which is, it's such a thick layer."
00:32:45,00:32:48,"They're pretty toasty, I think, in the water."
00:32:48,00:32:49,There's a lot.
00:32:49,00:32:52,"And well, they're so heavy that a good way to hunt them if you're a polar bear,"
00:32:52,00:32:57,"if there are any polar bears listening, is to cause a stampede."
00:32:57,00:33:01,So they're actually quite difficult to hunt as a polar bear because they're so massive
00:33:01,00:33:01,on their own.
00:33:01,00:33:05,"It's quite hard to kill one on its own, but they always hang out together in huge groups,"
00:33:05,00:33:09,"and they're so heavy that if you start chasing them, they'll stampede over each other,"
00:33:09,00:33:12,"and they'll often crush a few of them, a few of each other on the way,"
00:33:12,00:33:14,and then you can pick up the leftovers.
00:33:14,00:33:17,The young ones are incredibly cute.
00:33:17,00:33:21,I know we were saying the bigger ones might not appear cute.
00:33:21,00:33:21,I think they are.
00:33:21,00:33:23,But the young ones definitely are.
00:33:23,00:33:25,And they're also really sweet with humans as well.
00:33:25,00:33:31,So there's been a few scientists that have talked about the fact that when a baby walrus
00:33:31,00:33:36,"is, when they're working with baby walruses, it will sort of rest its head on the scientist's lap."
00:33:36,00:33:40,And then it won't feel just content with that.
00:33:40,00:33:44,It will try and climb onto the scientists as if to just cuddle it in a way that a small puppy
00:33:44,00:33:48,would just want to get on top of you and sort of cuddle into you.
00:33:48,00:33:50,That is quite cute.
00:33:50,00:33:53,But what if it thinks you're an ice floe and then tries to dig it?
00:33:53,00:33:55,That's what it feels like.
00:33:55,00:33:56,These are humans with ice floes.
00:33:56,00:33:58,"Yeah, they're not musseldwells, mate."
00:33:58,00:34:00,They're not just going to go stab at anyone.
00:34:00,00:34:04,It feels like they're climbing on top of you like they think you're a lump of ice or something.
00:34:04,00:34:07,I think it's because they're thigmo-tactic.
00:34:07,00:34:10,"So they're very similar to earwigs in this one way,"
00:34:10,00:34:14,"which is that they're positively thigmo-tactic, which means that they love being touched."
00:34:14,00:34:15,"They're incredibly social, like you say."
00:34:15,00:34:18,And that's why they're often huddled together in big groups
00:34:18,00:34:20,because they are always touching each other.
00:34:20,00:34:24,90% of walruses will be touching another walrus when they land.
00:34:24,00:34:28,"And so when you look after them, when they're in captivity,"
00:34:28,00:34:31,"like at the Alaska Sea Life Center, I think, for instance,"
00:34:31,00:34:35,they employ four people round the clock per walrus
00:34:35,00:34:37,to be there just hugging it and keeping it in front of them.
00:34:37,00:34:38,"Oh, no."
00:34:38,00:34:39,Wow.
00:34:39,00:34:40,That's what they do.
00:34:40,00:34:43,Four walrus huggers for every walrus.
00:34:43,00:34:43,Wow.
00:34:43,00:34:46,I think they serve other purposes as well.
00:34:46,00:34:46,"You know, they feed them."
00:34:46,00:34:49,"You can't do much while you're hugging a walrus, you know."
00:34:49,00:34:50,You can be on your phone.
00:34:50,00:34:51,You can be on your phone.
00:34:51,00:34:52,"Yeah, you're right."
00:34:52,00:34:57,"But then, I mean, no one wants to be hugged by someone who's also,"
00:34:57,00:34:58,"like, doob-scrolling down Switzerland."
00:34:58,00:34:59,That is a really good point.
00:34:59,00:35:01,"No, the walruses do have a tendency to go,"
00:35:01,00:35:03,"""Look, can you put your phone down for having a moment?"""
00:35:03,00:35:09,"I was looking up an experiment that was done on walruses,"
00:35:09,00:35:11,and this was in 2009.
00:35:11,00:35:12,You know Six Flags?
00:35:12,00:35:14,The theme park in America?
00:35:14,00:35:14,No.
00:35:14,00:35:18,"So, it's a huge chain of theme parks in America,"
00:35:18,00:35:21,and they have a few branches all over the place.
00:35:21,00:35:24,"But in 2009, Six Flags in California"
00:35:24,00:35:27,built an artificial walrus vagina.
00:35:27,00:35:28,Did they?
00:35:28,00:35:28,Okay.
00:35:28,00:35:29,Yeah.
00:35:29,00:35:30,Like a roller coaster.
00:35:30,00:35:34,It was not for the public to have a go on.
00:35:34,00:35:35,"Oh, okay."
00:35:35,00:35:36,What was it for then?
00:35:36,00:35:37,It's in a theme park.
00:35:37,00:35:39,It's a walrus vagina?
00:35:39,00:35:39,Yeah.
00:35:39,00:35:42,"This is an animal-focused branch of the theme park,"
00:35:42,00:35:44,"and they had a few walruses in,"
00:35:44,00:35:48,and they wanted their walrus civuqueck
00:35:48,00:35:51,"to perform some sexual acts,"
00:35:51,00:35:54,so they could get their first ever semen sample of walrus.
00:35:54,00:35:55,"Oh, I see."
00:35:55,00:35:56,Yeah.
00:35:56,00:35:59,"And there was a scientist called Holly Marasso,"
00:35:59,00:36:01,"or Maracca, I'm not sure how that's pronounced."
00:36:01,00:36:05,"But she was in charge of this,"
00:36:05,00:36:08,and the largest artificial vagina on the market
00:36:08,00:36:09,was too small.
00:36:09,00:36:12,"They did buy one, which was used for cart horses,"
00:36:12,00:36:14,but it was tiny compared to what civuqueck needed.
00:36:14,00:36:16,If they come to my and summer's party
00:36:16,00:36:17,that I had last week.
00:36:17,00:36:21,"Well, his penis was 22 inches around,"
00:36:21,00:36:24,"and they had to custom-build it from a big old pipe,"
00:36:24,00:36:26,because it was just too huge.
00:36:26,00:36:27,That's amazing.
00:36:27,00:36:28,And I wrote to her.
00:36:28,00:36:29,"I wrote to the scientist,"
00:36:29,00:36:30,but she hasn't got back in touch with me.
00:36:30,00:36:33,"So I said, yeah, amazingly."
00:36:37,00:36:39,"Sally, I don't think it worked, did it?"
00:36:39,00:36:42,I think civuqueck died childless.
00:36:42,00:36:45,"He was very obedient, though, I think, civuqueck."
00:36:45,00:36:47,"So he was very good at exposing himself,"
00:36:47,00:36:50,and she learned what turned him on.
00:36:50,00:36:52,So she realized that when there were workmen
00:36:52,00:36:55,"using power tools, hammers and stuff nearby,"
00:36:55,00:36:56,"he would expose his penis,"
00:36:56,00:36:58,and that he just particularly liked those sounds.
00:36:58,00:37:00,He was aroused by them.
00:37:00,00:37:03,And so eventually they made these certain noises
00:37:03,00:37:05,"to make him expose himself,"
00:37:05,00:37:06,"and then they trained him,"
00:37:06,00:37:08,"eventually, to roll over and expose himself"
00:37:08,00:37:09,on the word penis.
00:37:09,00:37:11,"So you just shouted, ""Penis!"""
00:37:11,00:37:14,Imagine if you listened to this podcast.
00:37:14,00:37:18,He'd never get back on his back again.
00:37:18,00:37:23,"One thing I find interesting about walrus vaginas, actually,"
00:37:23,00:37:26,"and I assume this is true of lots of other animals,"
00:37:26,00:37:27,"but I'd never seen it before,"
00:37:27,00:37:31,is male walruses are famous for having
00:37:31,00:37:33,"bones in their penises, the baculum,"
00:37:33,00:37:36,"which is the longest, I think, in the animal kingdom,"
00:37:36,00:37:38,the walrus baculum.
00:37:38,00:37:42,But they also have a clitoral bone walruses.
00:37:42,00:37:44,So they have a bone in the clitoris.
00:37:44,00:37:47,"And this is something that does happen in a few animals,"
00:37:47,00:37:51,but is obviously less common than the penis bone.
00:37:51,00:37:53,And it's called a borbellum.
00:37:53,00:37:54,I've never heard that word before.
00:37:54,00:37:59,"A clitoral, a borbellum, B-A-U-B-E-W-L-U-M."
00:37:59,00:38:02,And that's what you call a clitoris bone.
00:38:02,00:38:03,So look out for that word.
00:38:03,00:38:08,"Their teeth are very crucial, as in their tusks."
00:38:08,00:38:10,"So they have a hierarchical system,"
00:38:10,00:38:13,"but the most important thing to your social status,"
00:38:13,00:38:15,they think in walrus hierarchies is the tusk.
00:38:15,00:38:18,"So if you break a tooth, if you have a bike accident or something,"
00:38:18,00:38:21,then suddenly you go from being the most sought after desirable man on the block
00:38:21,00:38:22,to being nothing.
00:38:22,00:38:24,"Wow, so weird."
00:38:24,00:38:25,"Oh, that's awful."
00:38:25,00:38:27,"They do walk on them, don't they?"
00:38:27,00:38:28,On their teeth.
00:38:28,00:38:29,What do you mean?
00:38:29,00:38:31,They sort of walk on them.
00:38:31,00:38:36,"And in fact, their scientific name is odobanus rosmarus,"
00:38:36,00:38:38,which literally means tooth walking seahorse.
00:38:38,00:38:40,It's a combination of latter than old Norse.
00:38:40,00:38:45,And it's because they jam their tusks into the ice to drag themselves along.
00:38:45,00:38:48,A bit like locking onto the icebergs.
00:38:48,00:38:48,"Yeah, they do."
00:38:48,00:38:50,And they also use them to break up the ice.
00:38:50,00:38:56,So there was an example of the females get very protective over their children.
00:38:56,00:38:59,"So if you get in between the child and the mother,"
00:38:59,00:39:01,then she'll come after you.
00:39:01,00:39:04,And there was an example of some scientists kind of moving a child
00:39:04,00:39:05,from one place to another.
00:39:05,00:39:10,And the mother came after them and kind of slammed her face down
00:39:10,00:39:14,with her tusks into the ice and used it as an ice breaker to open up the route.
00:39:14,00:39:16,So she could swim through it.
00:39:16,00:39:18,"Wow, that's so cool."
00:39:18,00:39:18,It's scary.
00:39:18,00:39:21,That's the stuff in horror films.
00:39:21,00:39:23,I know because they swim really fast as well.
00:39:23,00:39:25,Like they can swim three times faster than Michael Phelps.
00:39:25,00:39:30,So 22 miles an hour max speed.
00:39:30,00:39:34,So imagine that coming at you with smashing down its tusks
00:39:34,00:39:38,and swimming at three times as fast as Michael Phelps down still cute or...
00:39:38,00:39:42,"I, all I'm thinking is Earl Tupper missed a trick by getting just fish."
00:39:42,00:39:43,He should have strapped a walrus.
00:39:43,00:39:53,"OK, it is time for our final fact of the show."
00:39:53,00:39:54,And that is my fact.
00:39:54,00:39:59,"My fact this week is that for many years, the horror film The Unknown was missing."
00:39:59,00:40:02,Because the last surviving print was accidentally placed
00:40:02,00:40:05,into a pile of hundreds of film cans all marked unknown.
00:40:05,00:40:10,So this was a movie that was made in 1927.
00:40:10,00:40:12,And it was fairly popular in its time.
00:40:12,00:40:15,It started a very big actor called Lon Chaney.
00:40:15,00:40:18,"And the prints, as for a lot of movies around this time,"
00:40:18,00:40:20,just went missing and no one knew where it was.
00:40:20,00:40:24,"And in 1973, after years and years of it being missing,"
00:40:24,00:40:28,"it was discovered in the archives of the Cinématec Française,"
00:40:28,00:40:33,which is a big institution in France that has lots of archived movies.
00:40:33,00:40:36,And someone must have accidentally taken their copy
00:40:36,00:40:40,and popped it into a big room that had a bunch of unknowns
00:40:40,00:40:42,of films that had no information about them.
00:40:42,00:40:45,And so there it sat for all these years until they uncovered it.
00:40:45,00:40:48,And it's great that we have it again.
00:40:48,00:40:50,"Because as I say, Lon Chaney, big deal in his day."
00:40:50,00:40:52,"Sounds like an amazing movie, doesn't it?"
00:40:52,00:40:52,Yeah.
00:40:52,00:40:56,"It's about, well, it's about this guy who is a criminal"
00:40:57,00:41:01,and he goes to the circus pretending to be someone with no arms.
00:41:01,00:41:05,"And so to do that, he kind of ties his arms to his torso"
00:41:05,00:41:08,and then wears a shirt and a clove
00:41:08,00:41:10,so no one can tell that he actually has arms.
00:41:10,00:41:14,"And then he falls in love with this woman, Nanon,"
00:41:14,00:41:16,played by Joan Crawford before she became really famous.
00:41:16,00:41:20,And she is terrified of being touched by men.
00:41:20,00:41:23,"So that works even better that he doesn't have any arms,"
00:41:23,00:41:24,even though he does have arms.
00:41:24,00:41:25,And then...
00:41:25,00:41:27,"Much made in heaven, that's so sweet."
00:41:27,00:41:28,"I know, isn't it?"
00:41:28,00:41:31,"And then, well, it is until she finds out on his wedding night"
00:41:31,00:41:32,that he has arms.
00:41:32,00:41:34,"Oh, no."
00:41:34,00:41:40,"Anyway, so he then has a rival called Zanzi and kills him."
00:41:40,00:41:44,But the police can't take any fingerprints from him
00:41:44,00:41:45,because he doesn't have any arms.
00:41:45,00:41:47,And so he escapes.
00:41:47,00:41:47,How does he kill him?
00:41:47,00:41:49,He has arms.
00:41:49,00:41:50,He has arms.
00:41:50,00:41:52,"Oh, sorry, everyone thinks that he doesn't have arms."
00:41:52,00:41:54,"Oh, God, I fell into his trap thinking he didn't have arms."
00:41:54,00:41:55,I should have known.
00:41:55,00:41:57,Did he kill him?
00:41:57,00:42:00,"Because Zanzi or whatever he's called, saw that he had arms."
00:42:00,00:42:01,"And he was like, there's nothing left to do now,"
00:42:01,00:42:02,but for me to kill you.
00:42:02,00:42:03,You know what?
00:42:03,00:42:04,"I've gone too far already,"
00:42:04,00:42:06,because we're always giving away spoilers on this show.
00:42:06,00:42:08,And I get so much shit for it on Twitter.
00:42:08,00:42:10,"I'm not going to tell you what happens at the end of this movie,"
00:42:10,00:42:11,but it's really good.
00:42:11,00:42:13,And one amazing thing about it is that...
00:42:13,00:42:15,"What was the name of the guy who played him, Dan?"
00:42:15,00:42:19,"Lon Chaney, C-H-A-N-E-Y, Chaney, you reckon?"
00:42:19,00:42:20,"Lon Chaney, yeah, that's right."
00:42:20,00:42:24,"But he had a stunt double called Paul Desmouc,"
00:42:24,00:42:25,"who didn't have any arms,"
00:42:25,00:42:27,"because in the play,"
00:42:27,00:42:31,"the character had to drink with his feet,"
00:42:31,00:42:33,or he had to throw things for his feet in the circus.
00:42:33,00:42:34,"He was like a knife thrower,"
00:42:34,00:42:36,but he did it all with his feet.
00:42:36,00:42:39,"And so he had this actual performer called Paul Desmouc,"
00:42:39,00:42:40,who would do all this stuff for him.
00:42:40,00:42:42,And the way that they did it
00:42:42,00:42:44,is sometimes he would double for him
00:42:44,00:42:46,"if you could do it with the shots and stuff,"
00:42:46,00:42:47,if you could not see his face.
00:42:47,00:42:50,"But most of the time, Desmouc was doing the same job,"
00:42:50,00:42:52,but he was doing it just with his legs
00:42:52,00:42:57,and perfectly synchronized his legs with the actor's body.
00:42:57,00:42:58,And so they cut it.
00:42:58,00:43:00,So you only saw the top of the actor's body
00:43:00,00:43:02,"and the bottom of the stunt double's legs,"
00:43:02,00:43:03,and so they could do all that stuff.
00:43:03,00:43:04,Isn't that cool?
00:43:04,00:43:05,That's so clever.
00:43:05,00:43:08,So a man with no arms pretending to be a man with arms
00:43:08,00:43:10,pretending to be a man with no arms.
00:43:10,00:43:12,It's many layers.
00:43:12,00:43:15,"It's like the Shakespearean boys pretending to be girls to be boys,"
00:43:15,00:43:16,isn't it?
00:43:16,00:43:16,Yeah.
00:43:16,00:43:16,Yeah.
00:43:16,00:43:18,And that's on my blur.
00:43:18,00:43:19,Is that?
00:43:19,00:43:19,Yeah.
00:43:20,00:43:23,"Boys with no arms who like girls, who have arms,"
00:43:23,00:43:25,but hate men who have arms.
00:43:25,00:43:30,"Dan, you mentioned Lon Cheney."
00:43:30,00:43:30,Yeah.
00:43:30,00:43:32,He does sound incredible.
00:43:32,00:43:32,Yeah.
00:43:32,00:43:35,So he played so many different things.
00:43:35,00:43:39,He was called the man of a thousand faces
00:43:39,00:43:41,"because he appeared in all these different costumes,"
00:43:41,00:43:42,all these different roles.
00:43:42,00:43:44,"I mean, I've written down clowns and pirates."
00:43:44,00:43:46,I imagine his brain was even broader than that.
00:43:46,00:43:48,"He played lots of foreign people,"
00:43:48,00:43:51,which obviously you probably wouldn't do today.
00:43:51,00:43:54,"But in the 1920s, he played so many different roles"
00:43:54,00:43:56,and kinds of person that there was a popular joke.
00:43:56,00:43:57,And this was the joke.
00:43:57,00:43:59,"It was, don't step on that spider."
00:43:59,00:44:00,It might be Lon Cheney.
00:44:00,00:44:01,"Well, that's familiar."
00:44:01,00:44:07,And he was a master of disguise in terms of his dedication
00:44:07,00:44:10,to makeup within the movies he was in.
00:44:10,00:44:11,"So like there's, for example, there's one movie"
00:44:11,00:44:13,where he plays both the hero and the villain.
00:44:13,00:44:17,And he was so convinced that his makeup could transform that.
00:44:17,00:44:20,"When he played Quasimodo in The Hunchback of Notre Dame,"
00:44:20,00:44:23,he took the idea of having a growth over his eye
00:44:23,00:44:26,"so seriously that with the makeup done,"
00:44:26,00:44:29,it resulted in him having permanent short-sightedness
00:44:29,00:44:32,"of the stress that he put on, onto his body."
00:44:32,00:44:34,He often used to put himself in physical pain
00:44:34,00:44:36,in order to get that appearance right.
00:44:36,00:44:40,"So he, when he was playing a legless criminal mastermind."
00:44:40,00:44:43,"So he, in another movie, played a legless criminal."
00:44:43,00:44:47,He bound his legs into a tight harness.
00:44:47,00:44:50,And that actually cut off a lot of blood vessels in his legs
00:44:50,00:44:52,so that he did kind of lose the use of his legs.
00:44:52,00:44:54,"Oh, right. But then for the sequel,"
00:44:54,00:44:55,he didn't have to have a stunt double.
00:44:55,00:44:57,So that was useful.
00:44:57,00:44:58,"So yeah, exactly."
00:44:58,00:45:00,"But yeah, and he was a big guy."
00:45:00,00:45:03,He was a silent movie guy that was in that transfer
00:45:03,00:45:04,to the talkies.
00:45:04,00:45:08,"And in fact, when it became the talkies,"
00:45:08,00:45:10,"it was so interesting, he wrote for his first movie"
00:45:10,00:45:13,because he did five different voices
00:45:13,00:45:15,in his first ever talking movie.
00:45:15,00:45:17,He signed a statement to attest to the fact
00:45:17,00:45:18,that it was in fact his voices.
00:45:18,00:45:22,And this was sort of published so that people believed
00:45:22,00:45:24,that it was him who had an actual voice
00:45:24,00:45:25,and that he was talking.
00:45:25,00:45:28,Was that publicity for the film?
00:45:28,00:45:31,So because people wanted to hear him talk?
00:45:31,00:45:32,"Yes, exactly."
00:45:32,00:45:33,"No, it was publicity just to say,"
00:45:33,00:45:35,you may think that this is being dubbed.
00:45:35,00:45:36,I'm not just the man of a thousand faces.
00:45:36,00:45:37,I also do voices.
00:45:37,00:45:41,"And the man of a thousand faces, five voices, no legs."
00:45:44,00:45:47,"Yeah, these lost films are incredible."
00:45:47,00:45:49,The ones that keep popping up everywhere.
00:45:49,00:45:53,"And you mentioned the Cinématec Francaise, was it, Dan?"
00:45:53,00:45:53,Yes.
00:45:53,00:45:56,They have been recategorising their films since 1992.
00:45:56,00:46:00,"So nearly 30 years now,"
00:46:00,00:46:01,and they still have another decade to go.
00:46:01,00:46:03,They've just got so many films that they're trying
00:46:03,00:46:05,to work out what they all are.
00:46:05,00:46:07,It's quite hard to tell the difference between a lost film
00:46:07,00:46:09,and a film that no one's looked for yet.
00:46:09,00:46:12,I think this is a problem that the BFI had
00:46:12,00:46:17,"when they created, in 2010, their 75 Most Wanted Films List."
00:46:17,00:46:20,"And they've been finding them at a rate of knots, really."
00:46:20,00:46:22,"I mean, as soon as they publish it, people are getting in touch,"
00:46:22,00:46:23,"going, oh yeah, I got the DVD of that."
00:46:23,00:46:24,"Yeah, yeah, here you go."
00:46:24,00:46:28,Which is such great news.
00:46:28,00:46:30,"So of the top 75, they've discovered 18."
00:46:30,00:46:33,"I think maybe one of them, or a film that was famously lost,"
00:46:33,00:46:39,"was Gaslight, which is interesting because the reason it was lost"
00:46:39,00:46:44,"is because MGM tried to gaslight us into thinking it didn't exist,"
00:46:44,00:46:45,confusingly.
00:46:45,00:46:50,"So this was the original film called Gaslight was released in 1940,"
00:46:50,00:46:52,and I think it was a British version.
00:46:52,00:46:55,"And then MGM got the rights to it and released it in 1944,"
00:46:55,00:46:57,but they got the rights on the one condition
00:46:57,00:46:59,"that all copies of the 1940 film,"
00:46:59,00:47:01,"even all the negatives, were completely destroyed."
00:47:01,00:47:04,"So if anyone said, what's the film Gaslight?"
00:47:04,00:47:05,"They'd be, it's this one."
00:47:05,00:47:06,What are you talking about?
00:47:06,00:47:08,This is the film Gaslight.
00:47:08,00:47:11,"And the only reason, actually, we have the original 1941"
00:47:11,00:47:14,"is because the director of it, who was called Thorold Dickinson,"
00:47:14,00:47:16,"for much cooler names in the olden days,"
00:47:16,00:47:18,had made his own personal copy.
00:47:18,00:47:20,And so he went and produced it.
00:47:20,00:47:24,"And that's where the word gaslighting today comes from, isn't it?"
00:47:24,00:47:26,"Because it was the movie, maybe based on a novel,"
00:47:26,00:47:30,"I'm not sure, but it's based on someone's boyfriend"
00:47:30,00:47:32,who tries to convince her that she's gone mad or something.
00:47:32,00:47:34,"Yeah, based on the player, I think."
00:47:34,00:47:36,"It's, isn't it, he tries to convince her"
00:47:36,00:47:40,that it's something to do with gaslighting in the house?
00:47:40,00:47:42,"I can't remember what he's explaining or it's, yeah."
00:47:42,00:47:46,"Yeah, so he's always, he basically makes the lights go down lower."
00:47:46,00:47:49,"And then she, who's played by Ingrid Bergman, says,"
00:47:49,00:47:50,the lights have gone lower.
00:47:50,00:47:52,"And he says, no, they're not, you've gone mad."
00:47:52,00:47:54,And then he does lots of other stuff.
00:47:54,00:47:56,"But he shouldn't, I mean, that's not a really"
00:47:56,00:47:58,"an obvious symptom of going mad, is it really?"
00:47:58,00:48:00,He should have like dressed as a rabbit
00:48:00,00:48:03,"and danced around in the front room and said, did you see that?"
00:48:03,00:48:04,"He's like, what are you on about?"
00:48:04,00:48:05,That would be...
00:48:05,00:48:06,That was the next scene.
00:48:06,00:48:09,He should have got Lon Chaney in to do one of his
00:48:09,00:48:11,weird jumping around with no arm.
00:48:11,00:48:13,Lon Chaney appears to be stuck in the bath.
00:48:13,00:48:14,"No, no."
00:48:14,00:48:18,What are you on about?
00:48:18,00:48:20,Just your mind playing tricks again.
00:48:20,00:48:21,"Oh, that's it."
00:48:21,00:48:23,Lon Chaney's back and this time he's got eight legs.
00:48:23,00:48:29,One famous movie that's missing is
00:48:29,00:48:34,The Arrival of a Train at Van Sen Station by Georges Mellier.
00:48:34,00:48:38,"So one of the oldest of all the cinematographers,"
00:48:38,00:48:41,"a French guy who did lots of really early,"
00:48:41,00:48:44,"very, very short movies of things happening."
00:48:44,00:48:47,"For instance, trains arriving at stations and stuff like that."
00:48:47,00:48:49,But what I find really interesting about this one
00:48:49,00:48:54,"is an 1896 film, which we don't know where it is."
00:48:54,00:48:57,"But what we do have is we have a flip book of the film,"
00:48:58,00:49:02,which in 1896 is essentially the same thing.
00:49:02,00:49:02,"Yeah, so cool."
00:49:02,00:49:06,The one just every frame has become a page in the book.
00:49:06,00:49:06,Wow.
00:49:06,00:49:09,Have they stitched it back together to turn it back into a film?
00:49:09,00:49:10,They should do something.
00:49:10,00:49:12,"They should, because then they can say it's based on a book."
00:49:12,00:49:14,That's popular for films.
00:49:14,00:49:19,"There is, weirdly, just a combo fact there."
00:49:19,00:49:23,"There's a myth that when film was in its infancy,"
00:49:23,00:49:25,there was a silent movie.
00:49:25,00:49:27,It was just of a train arriving in a station.
00:49:28,00:49:30,But I think it was face-on.
00:49:30,00:49:32,It might have been by the Lumiere brothers.
00:49:32,00:49:34,So the train is coming right towards the camera.
00:49:34,00:49:35,"Oh, yeah."
00:49:35,00:49:39,There was a myth that this was so realistic and terrifying
00:49:39,00:49:42,"for the audience who'd never seen cinema before,"
00:49:42,00:49:43,that the audience bolted.
00:49:43,00:49:46,They all shit themselves en masse.
00:49:46,00:49:49,Every one of the 500 people shit themselves.
00:49:49,00:49:53,"No, that's not the urban myth."
00:49:53,00:49:54,It's a good urban myth.
00:49:54,00:49:56,That's the one I've been spreading.
00:49:56,00:50:00,"Anyway, it doesn't seem to have ever happened."
00:50:00,00:50:00,That's the thing.
00:50:00,00:50:03,No one has ever bolted or shat themselves en masse
00:50:03,00:50:05,if they still put it on a train.
00:50:05,00:50:07,Another film which has gone missing
00:50:07,00:50:11,is the first film ever directed by an African-American.
00:50:11,00:50:14,And actually loads of these have gone missing.
00:50:14,00:50:16,"So there was a thing which I didn't know about,"
00:50:16,00:50:21,which went from 1915 all the way up to the 1950s called race films.
00:50:21,00:50:25,And what it was was Hollywood was making all these movies.
00:50:25,00:50:26,"But at the same time,"
00:50:26,00:50:29,other people were making films specifically for black people.
00:50:29,00:50:30,So you would have black directors.
00:50:30,00:50:32,You would have black actors.
00:50:32,00:50:33,You would have black producers.
00:50:33,00:50:35,You'd have basically black people doing the whole thing.
00:50:35,00:50:38,But they would only be shown in theaters
00:50:38,00:50:39,that were usually segregated
00:50:39,00:50:41,so that only black people could even watch them.
00:50:41,00:50:44,"And there were like hundreds and hundreds of these things made,"
00:50:44,00:50:46,but almost all of them went missing.
00:50:46,00:50:50,"And then in 1983, there was a place called"
00:50:50,00:50:53,the Southwest Film Video Archives in Dallas.
00:50:54,00:50:57,"And they rang up this kind of historian and said,"
00:50:57,00:50:59,"""Look, there's a load of old tapes here."
00:50:59,00:51:01,They're just taking up a load of space.
00:51:01,00:51:02,We're going to get rid of them.
00:51:02,00:51:04,"Do you want to have a look through them?"""
00:51:04,00:51:06,"And he went, ""Okay, well, I'm going to have a look through them."""
00:51:06,00:51:08,"And it turned out that it was all of these old,"
00:51:08,00:51:10,"what they call, race films."
00:51:10,00:51:11,And now we have loads of them back
00:51:11,00:51:14,and they're restoring them all and people can watch them again.
00:51:14,00:51:15,- Wow. - Isn't that cool?
00:51:15,00:51:17,That is so cool.
00:51:17,00:51:20,It's amazing how little people thought ahead at the time.
00:51:20,00:51:21,"It's something that actually Alex,"
00:51:21,00:51:24,"our colleague, gets really agitated about"
00:51:24,00:51:26,when so much of the BBC's archives have gone missing
00:51:26,00:51:28,because they just didn't really preserve stuff.
00:51:28,00:51:30,"- Well, they taped over it."
00:51:30,00:51:32,It wasn't that it went missing.
00:51:32,00:51:35,"They decided that all these tapes were useless,"
00:51:35,00:51:36,hanging out in the back rooms.
00:51:36,00:51:40,Classic comedies that were made were all destroyed.
00:51:40,00:51:42,"So Peter Cook, British comedian,"
00:51:42,00:51:45,he begged the BBC to give him the tapes
00:51:45,00:51:46,so that they wouldn't be destroyed.
00:51:46,00:51:48,"""I'll buy you new tapes,"" he said,"
00:51:48,00:51:49,"""and you can have fresh ones."""
00:51:49,00:51:50,"And they still said, ""No, it's our property,"
00:51:50,00:51:53,"""so we're just going to make sure it's kind of destroyed."""
00:51:53,00:51:55,"- No way. - Yeah, so it wasn't even lost."
00:51:55,00:51:56,It was actively destroyed.
00:51:56,00:51:58,"- We should say why they also,"
00:51:58,00:51:59,"why there are so few,"
00:51:59,00:52:01,another reason as apart from people destroying them
00:52:01,00:52:04,is that they just burn so easily.
00:52:04,00:52:05,They set on fire.
00:52:05,00:52:07,"The early film, ""Nitrate"" film,"
00:52:07,00:52:09,it can combust at 41 degrees Celsius.
00:52:09,00:52:11,- And you're in LA.
00:52:11,00:52:14,"- I know, I mean, it's..."
00:52:14,00:52:15,And also the other problem is that
00:52:15,00:52:16,"it has to go through a projector gate,"
00:52:16,00:52:18,"obviously reels of film, you know,"
00:52:18,00:52:19,"balanced on a projector,"
00:52:19,00:52:21,pushing it through the projector's gate creates friction.
00:52:21,00:52:22,Guess what that does?
00:52:22,00:52:24,Frequently sets it on fire.
00:52:24,00:52:28,"And also, the substance it's made of, ""Nitrate"" film,"
00:52:28,00:52:31,"it produces more oxygen as it burns,"
00:52:31,00:52:33,which adds to the flame.
00:52:33,00:52:35,It can keep burning even if you put it underwater.
00:52:35,00:52:39,It's staggering that any of this stuff
00:52:39,00:52:40,is even left on the planet.
00:52:40,00:52:42,It's so unstable.
00:52:42,00:52:44,It just doesn't want to exist in a stable form.
00:52:44,00:52:47,- So one movie that was destroyed in the 1920s
00:52:47,00:52:49,"was a movie called ""Humorisk,"""
00:52:49,00:52:51,which was a movie that was the only silent movie
00:52:51,00:52:52,of the Marx brothers.
00:52:52,00:52:54,And this is before they went into talkies themselves.
00:52:54,00:52:57,And it was destroyed on purpose
00:52:57,00:52:59,because Groucho Marx hated it so much
00:52:59,00:53:02,that he bought up the film and he burnt it
00:53:02,00:53:03,so that no one could ever see it again.
00:53:03,00:53:06,"And you always hear of artists who dream of that scenario,"
00:53:06,00:53:09,being able to go and remove from the shelves.
00:53:09,00:53:12,"George Lucas did a Christmas special for ""Star Wars."""
00:53:12,00:53:14,His dream is to sledgehammer every single copy
00:53:14,00:53:16,"out of existence, and no one can."
00:53:16,00:53:18,But Groucho Marx managed it.
00:53:18,00:53:20,- He got rid of history. - That's amazing.
00:53:20,00:53:20,Wow.
00:53:20,00:53:23,"That's like, I mean, this is off topic."
00:53:23,00:53:24,"We're just thinking of people who hate the film,"
00:53:24,00:53:26,"say, produced and wish they were destroyed."
00:53:26,00:53:28,I remember reading an interview with Patrick Stewart
00:53:28,00:53:30,who said that his biggest regret was doing a film
00:53:30,00:53:32,"called ""Wild Geese 2."""
00:53:32,00:53:34,And he said the only reason he took the role
00:53:34,00:53:36,is because he was offered the exact same amount of money
00:53:36,00:53:39,for it as a repair for a window in his house
00:53:39,00:53:40,had just been quoted.
00:53:40,00:53:42,I don't know what kind of windows he's got.
00:53:42,00:53:44,- Nice windows. - Yeah.
00:53:46,00:53:48,"Oh, my God. The guy who was his glazier"
00:53:48,00:53:50,must have been just like Steven Spielberg
00:53:50,00:53:52,"in a mustache or something that he's like, ""Yeah."""
00:53:52,00:53:53,Yeah.
00:53:53,00:53:56,This will cost you $13.6 million.
00:53:56,00:54:02,Do you guys know when the last silent movie star died?
00:54:02,00:54:06,"Well, how do we define silent movie star?"
00:54:06,00:54:07,"Because, for instance, the guy and the artist,"
00:54:07,00:54:09,"that was a silent movie, wasn't it?"
00:54:09,00:54:12,"Oh, I'm not counting Jean Dujard down as a silent movie star."
00:54:12,00:54:13,No way.
00:54:13,00:54:16,Sorry. Last person from the original silent movie.
00:54:16,00:54:17,Who was enlightened to them?
00:54:17,00:54:18,I would have said they were probably...
00:54:18,00:54:20,"They became talkies in the '20s, didn't they?"
00:54:20,00:54:22,Is that one of that?
00:54:22,00:54:25,"So, let's say someone was 10 when that came out"
00:54:25,00:54:27,and they died when they were 100.
00:54:27,00:54:30,"- Then I was... - Yeah, possibly a couple of years ago."
00:54:30,00:54:30,Yeah.
00:54:30,00:54:34,"Yeah, I'm going to say there was a kid"
00:54:34,00:54:38,"who played the kid in the movie ""The Kid."""
00:54:38,00:54:42,"No, but did you not see the prequel to that?"
00:54:42,00:54:43,"""The Fetus."""
00:54:43,00:54:47,"Lon Chaney played ""The Fetus,"" I believe."
00:54:47,00:54:51,"Yeah, he built himself an entire womb."
00:54:51,00:54:54,Amazing.
00:54:54,00:54:56,"But Jackie Coogan was in that movie, ""The Kid,"""
00:54:56,00:54:59,and I'm going to say him.
00:54:59,00:55:01,He was uncle Fester in the Adams family as well.
00:55:01,00:55:03,He died in the '80s.
00:55:03,00:55:06,"Okay. So, all right."
00:55:06,00:55:08,"So, James and Anna are saying the last couple of years,"
00:55:08,00:55:10,"and you're saying the '80s, don't you?"
00:55:10,00:55:11,James and Anna are closer. It's 2020.
00:55:12,00:55:17,"""Baby Peggy"" was her name, not her forever."
00:55:17,00:55:19,She had lost the baby element.
00:55:19,00:55:20,"Actually, she had lost the Peggy element."
00:55:20,00:55:20,She changed her name.
00:55:20,00:55:23,But she was so famous.
00:55:23,00:55:26,"She was one of the highest-paid movie stars in the entire 1920s,"
00:55:26,00:55:28,which was a gold rush time in Hollywood.
00:55:28,00:55:29,"She was so famous, she was the mascot"
00:55:29,00:55:33,of the 1924 Democratic Convention in New York.
00:55:33,00:55:34,Wow.
00:55:34,00:55:36,She turned up on stage next to...
00:55:36,00:55:37,Not sure who it was. Ruth fell to someone.
00:55:37,00:55:41,"And that was back in the days of silent conventions, wasn't it?"
00:55:41,00:55:44,"Yeah. Oh, for those days again."
00:55:44,00:55:49,The last adult man to be in a silent movie
00:55:49,00:55:50,was a guy called Shep Horton.
00:55:50,00:55:52,And he only died in 2017.
00:55:52,00:55:54,And he was in silent movies.
00:55:54,00:55:55,Shep Horton.
00:55:55,00:55:55,Shep Horton.
00:55:55,00:55:57,"Yeah, H-O-U-G-H."
00:55:57,00:56:00,"But he was called ""The Last of the Great Nobodies""."
00:56:00,00:56:03,Incredible.
00:56:03,00:56:05,"So, he was in hundreds of films."
00:56:05,00:56:07,"He was in ""Gone with the Wind"", ""The Big Sleep"","
00:56:07,00:56:08,"""Cleopatra"", ""Wizard of Oz"","
00:56:08,00:56:11,but always just as a kind of handsome dude
00:56:11,00:56:12,in the background.
00:56:12,00:56:14,But you can see him in all of these films.
00:56:14,00:56:16,They've tracked loads of the movies he's in.
00:56:16,00:56:17,He was in a dozen films a month.
00:56:17,00:56:19,I know.
00:56:19,00:56:21,"You feel like he definitely, when he..."
00:56:21,00:56:22,That was on his CV.
00:56:22,00:56:24,"He coughed over the last word, didn't he?"
00:56:24,00:56:28,"I'd say, ""Well, they called me The Last of the Great Nobodies""."
00:56:28,00:56:33,"But after he died, they put his gravestone"
00:56:33,00:56:35,"in a pile of other gravestone of ""Nobody's""."
00:56:36,00:56:37,Hi.
00:56:37,00:56:41,"Okay, that's it."
