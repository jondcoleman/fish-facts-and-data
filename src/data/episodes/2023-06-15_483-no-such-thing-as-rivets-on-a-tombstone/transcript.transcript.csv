00:00:02,00:00:05,"- Hi everyone, welcome to this week's episode"
00:00:05,00:00:07,"of ""Notice Things of Fish"""
00:00:07,00:00:12,where we are joined by the wonderful Ella Al-Shemahi.
00:00:12,00:00:16,You might remember Ella from episode 373
00:00:16,00:00:19,"of ""Notice Things of Fish"" when she last appeared,"
00:00:19,00:00:21,"but if you don't remember that,"
00:00:21,00:00:24,then she is a paleoanthropologist.
00:00:24,00:00:26,She's an expert in Neanderthals.
00:00:26,00:00:29,She is a National Geographic Explorer.
00:00:29,00:00:32,She's just an all-round badass.
00:00:32,00:00:35,"Ella has written a book called ""The Handshake"
00:00:35,00:00:36,"""A Gripping History,"""
00:00:36,00:00:38,"which we talked about last time she was on,"
00:00:38,00:00:40,"but she's also been on loads of TV shows,"
00:00:40,00:00:42,loads of documentaries.
00:00:42,00:00:45,"The last one I think was called ""Our Changing Planet,"""
00:00:45,00:00:48,"all about the world's most threatened ecosystems,"
00:00:48,00:00:49,and you can actually still watch that
00:00:49,00:00:54,if you go to BBC iPlayer or PBS Video app.
00:00:54,00:00:56,"Anyway, really hope you enjoyed this week's show."
00:00:56,00:00:58,"Don't forget, ""Club Fish"" exists,"
00:00:58,00:01:00,a place where you can get loads of extra content
00:01:00,00:01:02,and ad-free episodes.
00:01:02,00:01:05,"Don't forget, there are still one or two tickets,"
00:01:05,00:01:08,"I think, possibly left for our live shows"
00:01:08,00:01:10,"coming up in the Soho Theatre in London,"
00:01:10,00:01:12,and you can get those by going to

00:01:16,00:01:18,"Really hope you enjoy this week's show with Ella,"
00:01:18,00:01:21,and it's on with the podcast.
00:01:21,00:01:23,(upbeat music)
00:01:24,00:01:28,(speaking in foreign language)
00:01:28,00:01:38,"- Hello, and welcome to another episode"
00:01:38,00:01:40,"of No Such Thing as a Fish, a weekly podcast"
00:01:40,00:01:43,coming to you from the QI offices in Hoburn.
00:01:43,00:01:45,"My name is Dan Schreiber, I am sitting here"
00:01:45,00:01:47,"with Andrew Hunter Murray, James Harkin,"
00:01:47,00:01:50,"and Ella Alshamahi, and once again,"
00:01:50,00:01:51,we have gathered around the microphones
00:01:51,00:01:54,"with our four favorite facts from the last seven days,"
00:01:54,00:01:57,"and in no particular order, here we go."
00:01:57,00:02:00,"Starting with fact number one, and that is Ella."
00:02:00,00:02:03,- American beer was so bad in the early 1900s
00:02:03,00:02:08,that the US government sent Alexander Graham Bell's son-in-law
00:02:08,00:02:14,on a secret mission to Bavaria to steal German hops.
00:02:14,00:02:16,"- Wow, God, so much to unpack."
00:02:16,00:02:20,"- Yeah, okay, so Alexander Graham Bell's son-in-law,"
00:02:20,00:02:21,"was that an important part of,"
00:02:21,00:02:22,was that what the American government
00:02:22,00:02:23,"were looking for, was that the brief?"
00:02:23,00:02:26,"- The really sad thing is, David Fairchild"
00:02:26,00:02:28,"is like a hugely celebrated botanist,"
00:02:28,00:02:30,"and is described as the food explorer,"
00:02:30,00:02:31,"and yet for our purposes,"
00:02:31,00:02:34,he's just Alexander Graham Bell's son-in-law.
00:02:34,00:02:36,"'Cause to be fair, if he was your father-in-law,"
00:02:36,00:02:38,"that's the end of your identity, right?"
00:02:38,00:02:39,"- But was it, maybe this was at the point"
00:02:39,00:02:42,"when there was only two telephones in the country,"
00:02:42,00:02:43,and so the government would just call him up
00:02:43,00:02:46,"and say, ""You got anyone we could use?"""
00:02:46,00:02:46,- Yeah.
00:02:46,00:02:49,"- So you think when he invented two telephones,"
00:02:49,00:02:51,"Alexander Graham Bell, he gave one to the government,"
00:02:51,00:02:54,"and kept one himself, and no one else needs one, it's fine."
00:02:54,00:02:55,"- And it became like the bat phone,"
00:02:55,00:02:57,was any time they were needed for anything.
00:02:57,00:02:58,- The bell phone.
00:02:58,00:02:59,"- Yeah, the bell phone."
00:02:59,00:03:01,"- I'm loving the facts today, guys."
00:03:01,00:03:03,"- So yeah, what's this guy, Fairchild?"
00:03:03,00:03:04,"- So, all right, so David Fairchild,"
00:03:04,00:03:08,"so he's a food explorer, and I think he's absolutely"
00:03:08,00:03:11,"fascinating, 'cause explorers usually go around the planet,"
00:03:11,00:03:12,"let's be honest, discovering stuff,"
00:03:12,00:03:14,"but also pillaging a lot, and what have you,"
00:03:14,00:03:17,"and like stealing artifacts, and whatever takes your fancy."
00:03:17,00:03:21,"But this guy did it with plants, with botany,"
00:03:21,00:03:23,"which is, in my mind, is just like the loveliest thing"
00:03:23,00:03:25,to go around the planet stealing.
00:03:25,00:03:27,(laughing)
00:03:27,00:03:29,"'Cause all he's doing is, he's basically turned around"
00:03:29,00:03:31,"at the beginning of the 1900s going,"
00:03:31,00:03:33,"and the end of the 1800s going,"
00:03:33,00:03:36,"America is a country clearly on the rise,"
00:03:36,00:03:39,"but our agriculture's bad, our food is bad,"
00:03:39,00:03:44,"but our industries as related to plants are just bad,"
00:03:44,00:03:47,"so I'm gonna go off to 50-odd countries,"
00:03:47,00:03:51,"and just collect samples, send seeds back,"
00:03:51,00:03:53,"send saplings back, that kind of thing."
00:03:53,00:03:55,"And because it's plants, I just can't get mad at him,"
00:03:55,00:03:57,"because I'm just like, you were just helping"
00:03:57,00:03:59,"to feed your people, and build industry."
00:03:59,00:04:01,"- Could we get him canceled because he was like,"
00:04:01,00:04:03,stealing from the farms in other countries?
00:04:03,00:04:04,- Are you trying to get him canceled?
00:04:04,00:04:06,- I'm doing my best.
00:04:06,00:04:08,"I do this on this podcast, you know, and we have that."
00:04:08,00:04:10,- Don't ever mention anyone you like on this show.
00:04:10,00:04:12,James will find a way to destroy it.
00:04:12,00:04:14,"- Do not do this to me, 'cause I actually,"
00:04:14,00:04:17,I've decided that he's like the one explorer
00:04:17,00:04:19,that I really have nothing bad to say about.
00:04:19,00:04:20,"I'm like, I'm not fair enough,"
00:04:20,00:04:22,you're trying to feed your people.
00:04:22,00:04:24,"He did give the Americans broccoli and kale, so."
00:04:24,00:04:26,"- Oh yeah, yeah, I love those two things."
00:04:26,00:04:30,- It's interesting how limited American food was.
00:04:30,00:04:33,"I didn't really appreciate that before the 1890s,"
00:04:33,00:04:34,when he really got crack.
00:04:34,00:04:36,"They had occasional introductions,"
00:04:36,00:04:39,"like in the World's Fair in 1876,"
00:04:39,00:04:41,"which was effectively America's 100th birthday,"
00:04:41,00:04:43,"they got the banana, that was good."
00:04:43,00:04:44,That was a big advance.
00:04:44,00:04:47,"- Also, can we just take a second to talk about world fairs?"
00:04:47,00:04:48,Aren't they just the best thing ever?
00:04:48,00:04:49,- Yeah.
00:04:49,00:04:51,"- Just this world where you were like,"
00:04:51,00:04:53,"oh, let's just do a World Fair."
00:04:53,00:04:55,"And it actually was like everyone was like,"
00:04:55,00:04:56,"oh crap, that's actually, that's new."
00:04:56,00:04:57,"That's, what is that?"
00:04:57,00:04:58,It's yellow and it's bendy.
00:04:58,00:04:59,That's amazing.
00:04:59,00:04:59,- When did we last have one?
00:04:59,00:05:00,It's been a long time.
00:05:00,00:05:02,"- Well, I went to one in Dubai this year."
00:05:02,00:05:04,"- Oh yes, okay, so this year."
00:05:04,00:05:06,"- Oh yeah, they did that, hold on."
00:05:06,00:05:08,"- Well, they did one during COVID,"
00:05:08,00:05:10,and obviously no one could go.
00:05:10,00:05:13,"And then when I went, everything was closed."
00:05:13,00:05:15,"So you couldn't even get an Uber, everyone had gone home."
00:05:15,00:05:16,"- Oh, right."
00:05:16,00:05:17,- 'Cause that's what it is.
00:05:17,00:05:20,"They build them these sort of huge things, don't they?"
00:05:20,00:05:22,And all the different countries have their different stalls
00:05:22,00:05:24,"where they're saying, in Uzbekistan,"
00:05:24,00:05:26,we make amazing bananas or whatever.
00:05:26,00:05:29,"And then two years later, they all go home and that's it."
00:05:29,00:05:31,"- They only do with countries that are on the rise, right?"
00:05:31,00:05:32,- Yeah.
00:05:32,00:05:34,"- Like, we wouldn't do a world,"
00:05:34,00:05:36,America wouldn't do a World Fair anymore.
00:05:36,00:05:38,"We are the world, why would we do a World Fair?"
00:05:38,00:05:39,- There was the big one in America.
00:05:39,00:05:40,Carl Sagan went to as a kid.
00:05:40,00:05:43,So Sagan would be in his 80s if he was still alive
00:05:43,00:05:45,"in the 1990s, so, you know, within that world."
00:05:45,00:05:48,"- The one in Dubai, just to say this is quite interesting"
00:05:48,00:05:51,'cause each country made their own sort of building
00:05:51,00:05:52,and they were all kind of shaped
00:05:52,00:05:56,with Uzbekistani design or Azerbaijani design or whatever.
00:05:56,00:05:57,And now they're changing it
00:05:57,00:06:00,and they're turning it into flats the whole place.
00:06:00,00:06:01,- Oh wow.
00:06:01,00:06:03,- And they're gonna make it so you can live in this area.
00:06:03,00:06:04,But it means that all these buildings
00:06:04,00:06:06,are just these incredible designs
00:06:06,00:06:08,that have made from the best architects in the world.
00:06:08,00:06:09,- It sounds like you're selling Dubai
00:06:09,00:06:10,"instead of cancelling Dubai,"
00:06:10,00:06:14,which I thought you were the cancelling Dubai.
00:06:14,00:06:15,- Is it Dubai?
00:06:15,00:06:16,"- There's no, you can't get an Uber there."
00:06:16,00:06:18,"You can't, there's no shops there already for you."
00:06:18,00:06:19,So I'm gonna live here.
00:06:19,00:06:22,"- Oh, that's the bad side of Dubai, guys."
00:06:22,00:06:24,I'm all the bad crap.
00:06:24,00:06:26,"- Famously, there are no shops in Dubai."
00:06:26,00:06:30,Someone emailed in and I've got a bunch of their fact now
00:06:30,00:06:32,and also not credit them
00:06:32,00:06:32,'cause I don't think we're gonna end up
00:06:32,00:06:34,talking about World Fairs.
00:06:34,00:06:37,"It was a few years ago, the Brazilian delegation"
00:06:37,00:06:40,turned their entire thing into a trampoline.
00:06:40,00:06:41,- What?
00:06:41,00:06:43,"- It was something like a 4,000 square foot trampoline,"
00:06:43,00:06:45,the Brazilian bit of the world.
00:06:45,00:06:47,- Was it to sell rubber?
00:06:47,00:06:48,- I don't think it was.
00:06:48,00:06:49,I don't even think it was.
00:06:49,00:06:50,"I think it was just saying,"
00:06:50,00:06:52,"look, everyone else has got good stuff here."
00:06:52,00:06:54,"Well, you've got a big old trampoline."
00:06:54,00:06:56,"So just come along, have a bounce, enjoy yourself."
00:06:56,00:07:00,- They had a big project that at the last minute
00:07:00,00:07:00,got taken away.
00:07:00,00:07:03,"They went, what have we got?"
00:07:03,00:07:04,- Why are we talking about the World Fair?
00:07:04,00:07:05,"- I'm sorry, I got distracted."
00:07:05,00:07:07,"- Yeah, this is what happens when Ella is around."
00:07:07,00:07:08,"- Because during the World Fair,"
00:07:08,00:07:10,the banana was introduced to America.
00:07:10,00:07:11,- Yeah.
00:07:11,00:07:12,- And it's not food introduction.
00:07:12,00:07:13,- By Fairchild or someone else.
00:07:13,00:07:16,"- By someone else, that was like a sporadic thing."
00:07:16,00:07:18,"But then when he really got going,"
00:07:18,00:07:19,he was privately funded as well.
00:07:19,00:07:20,- Yes.
00:07:20,00:07:22,- By Barbaul Lathrop.
00:07:22,00:07:22,"- Yes, yes, yes."
00:07:22,00:07:25,"A wonderfully gay, fabulous figure, basically,"
00:07:25,00:07:27,who was just this incredible philanthropist.
00:07:27,00:07:29,"- Squillionaire, just looking for something to fund."
00:07:29,00:07:31,"- And they bumped into each other on a boat, didn't they?"
00:07:31,00:07:33,"And he just went, I'll fund this trip."
00:07:33,00:07:35,Are you trying to steal avocados?
00:07:35,00:07:37,"- Yeah, why not?"
00:07:37,00:07:37,This sounds great.
00:07:37,00:07:41,"- Can I just say, as an explorer with National Geographic,"
00:07:41,00:07:43,"that is our dream, that we're like, no, no, no."
00:07:43,00:07:45,"If you think I am kidding, you do not know,"
00:07:45,00:07:48,"like my friend group, in the sense that we are like,"
00:07:48,00:07:49,"we literally just sit there, constantly going,"
00:07:49,00:07:52,"all right, how do we get this kind of thing"
00:07:52,00:07:53,from philanthropy?
00:07:53,00:07:54,And every so often it works out.
00:07:54,00:07:56,"So I've got friends that like,"
00:07:56,00:07:59,"they're like this smart friend of the philanthropist,"
00:07:59,00:08:01,who is like some billionaire or millionaire.
00:08:01,00:08:03,"- They're like their sugar mama, dadda, whatever."
00:08:03,00:08:05,- Have I ever told you the story of Nat Geo?
00:08:05,00:08:07,Somebody walks up to me.
00:08:07,00:08:08,"It's really old guy, bless him."
00:08:08,00:08:10,That's the first time I've ever been at National Geographic.
00:08:10,00:08:13,"And he looks at me and goes, I'm from Austin, Texas."
00:08:13,00:08:14,"I'm not an oil man, but I've got money"
00:08:14,00:08:16,and I want to give you some.
00:08:16,00:08:17,(laughing)
00:08:17,00:08:19,- What the hell?
00:08:19,00:08:20,- I saw that money in my account.
00:08:20,00:08:22,An expedition was part funded by it.
00:08:22,00:08:24,"- Wow, so as simple as that."
00:08:24,00:08:25,"Okay, so it does happen."
00:08:25,00:08:27,"Yeah, that's amazing."
00:08:27,00:08:28,"So Fairchild, I agree."
00:08:28,00:08:30,"I think reading about him,"
00:08:30,00:08:31,he seems like an extraordinary guy.
00:08:31,00:08:34,"I'm surprised I'd never heard of him, for example."
00:08:34,00:08:36,"But if you're in America and you're eating,"
00:08:36,00:08:39,"say like peaches or nectarines or avocados or mangoes,"
00:08:39,00:08:42,"most likely the one that you're eating right now,"
00:08:42,00:08:44,"someone's bound to be eating one right now as they listen,"
00:08:44,00:08:47,shares genes from the ones that Fairchild
00:08:47,00:08:49,introduced to the country all those years ago.
00:08:49,00:08:54,What a sort of footprint he's left in the country.
00:08:54,00:08:55,- It's incredible.
00:08:55,00:08:57,- Send us your photos.
00:08:57,00:09:01,"If you're eating a mango now in America specifically,"
00:09:01,00:09:03,"or an avocado, some quinoa."
00:09:03,00:09:05,"- Yeah, did he bring in quinoa?"
00:09:05,00:09:07,"- Yep, podcast at qi.com."
00:09:07,00:09:09,- Mangosteens?
00:09:09,00:09:11,"- The mangosteen, oh great, let's talk about this."
00:09:11,00:09:12,This is great.
00:09:12,00:09:14,"- Go on, what about the mangosteen?"
00:09:14,00:09:17,- It's a fruit that he introduced and that never took off.
00:09:17,00:09:18,'Cause he introduced thousands.
00:09:18,00:09:19,And they didn't all take off.
00:09:19,00:09:22,"- Yeah, you can still buy mangosteens though, can't you?"
00:09:22,00:09:23,- Think so.
00:09:23,00:09:24,They just never explained it.
00:09:24,00:09:26,- I had never heard of the mangosteen before.
00:09:26,00:09:27,- I had never. - Really?
00:09:27,00:09:27,- Yeah.
00:09:27,00:09:30,- The guy who wrote the book on David Fairchild
00:09:30,00:09:32,"is Dan Stone, who's a friend of mine."
00:09:32,00:09:34,"And apparently while he was writing this book,"
00:09:34,00:09:36,everybody would just send him really exotic fruit
00:09:36,00:09:38,like for the whole time he was writing the book.
00:09:38,00:09:40,"'Cause they were like, this is good for you, no?"
00:09:40,00:09:41,- Yeah. - He's not sure.
00:09:41,00:09:43,"- Yeah, the book's called The Food Explorer, by the way."
00:09:43,00:09:46,I think it's fair to say that every bit of research I have
00:09:46,00:09:48,"is from Dan Stone, so yeah, well done."
00:09:48,00:09:50,"- So Dan, tell us about mangosteen, Sandy."
00:09:50,00:09:51,"- Well, as far as I can tell,"
00:09:51,00:09:53,"again, Dan and I have never heard of them before"
00:09:53,00:09:55,and you two are having them for breakfast every day.
00:09:55,00:09:57,So correct me if I'm wrong.
00:09:57,00:10:00,"But the size of a fist, roughly, and they're like a lychee."
00:10:00,00:10:01,- Brilliant.
00:10:01,00:10:03,"- But the problem is, they're not great for farming."
00:10:03,00:10:05,"And what he was doing, Fairchild,"
00:10:05,00:10:07,you have to persuade the farmers to grow the things
00:10:07,00:10:08,and the public to buy them.
00:10:08,00:10:11,"So it's got two jobs to carry out, basically."
00:10:11,00:10:12,"And he couldn't persuade either, apparently,"
00:10:12,00:10:13,either side of the equation.
00:10:13,00:10:17,"'Cause they're really hard, they bruise worse than peaches"
00:10:17,00:10:19,and they're just a nightmare to transport
00:10:19,00:10:21,and they go off really quickly.
00:10:21,00:10:23,But he said they were the queen of fruits.
00:10:23,00:10:24,"- They were his favorites. - Oh, really?"
00:10:24,00:10:25,- I know. - And he kept trying
00:10:25,00:10:28,"to make them happen, like fetch in Mean Girls."
00:10:28,00:10:29,(laughing)
00:10:29,00:10:30,He kept trying to make it happen
00:10:30,00:10:33,and no one was picking up on it.
00:10:33,00:10:35,"And so all these things he brought into the country,"
00:10:35,00:10:37,but the one of which you headlined your fact with
00:10:37,00:10:40,is very interesting because it was the beer hops.
00:10:40,00:10:41,"And you'd think you'd just go into a country,"
00:10:41,00:10:43,"grab some fruit and leave the country,"
00:10:43,00:10:45,"but no, people were so protective."
00:10:45,00:10:48,They would have boys sleeping with the hops at night
00:10:48,00:10:49,to make sure no one would steal.
00:10:49,00:10:51,"- Yeah, they would pay to security, that's the thing."
00:10:51,00:10:53,- So he'd come in and integrate himself with the communities.
00:10:53,00:10:55,He would sort of become friends.
00:10:55,00:10:57,"- And so this particular hop,"
00:10:57,00:10:58,"so this is, I think, the Sems hop,"
00:10:58,00:11:02,"he basically started talking about Sems,"
00:11:02,00:11:04,"the guy that came up with it, who was dead at this point."
00:11:04,00:11:08,"And he offered the son of Sems, basically he said,"
00:11:08,00:11:10,"""Look, I'm really scared that in a few generations,"
00:11:10,00:11:12,"""people aren't gonna know about your dad, blah, blah, blah."""
00:11:12,00:11:15,"So he was like, ""Why don't you build a plaque?"
00:11:15,00:11:16,"""I will pay for it."""
00:11:16,00:11:18,So he basically put money down.
00:11:18,00:11:20,Impressive US diplomacy here.
00:11:20,00:11:23,And they made such a song and dance about it.
00:11:23,00:11:24,Everybody was really happy.
00:11:24,00:11:26,"The whole, like, everybody in the town was happy about it."
00:11:26,00:11:30,And then apparently somebody at night knocks on his door
00:11:30,00:11:32,"when it's raining and goes, ""Do you want some?"
00:11:32,00:11:33,"""Do you want some cuttings?"""
00:11:33,00:11:35,And apparently he has to really restrain himself
00:11:35,00:11:37,"to not be like, ""Yes, this is exactly why I did all this"
00:11:37,00:11:40,"""and I've been manipulating you guys for weeks."""
00:11:40,00:11:41,"And he was like, ""Yeah, okay."""
00:11:41,00:11:43,"And he goes, ""Okay, I can't do this publicly."
00:11:43,00:11:46,"""I have to do it quietly, but I'll send 100 cuttings"
00:11:46,00:11:48,"""to the next station down the line."""
00:11:48,00:11:49,"- Oh, not even handing them over now."
00:11:49,00:11:50,"- No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no."
00:11:50,00:11:52,It was proper espionage.
00:11:52,00:11:53,- That's amazing.
00:11:53,00:11:57,"- It's hilarious, but also to think of all the espionage"
00:11:57,00:11:59,that the US government has ever done.
00:11:59,00:12:01,- I just can't object to this one.
00:12:01,00:12:05,"- Yeah, that's why American beer now is so delicious."
00:12:05,00:12:06,(laughing)
00:12:06,00:12:08,"I mean, how bad must it have been?"
00:12:08,00:12:10,"- So, here's the crazy thing."
00:12:10,00:12:11,"Apparently during Prohibition,"
00:12:11,00:12:15,all his hops were uprooted.
00:12:15,00:12:17,So all the same hops that Fertile Halled.
00:12:17,00:12:18,"- Oh, really?"
00:12:18,00:12:19,"- Yeah, they were all uprooted during the--"
00:12:19,00:12:20,- I read that.
00:12:20,00:12:21,"Basically when Prohibition came in,"
00:12:21,00:12:23,all the breweries closed down.
00:12:23,00:12:24,"And then when they reopened,"
00:12:24,00:12:26,there was a few more big ones
00:12:26,00:12:28,and they decided to sell what they knew would sell
00:12:28,00:12:31,'cause they weren't sure anyone would buy any beer anymore.
00:12:31,00:12:33,"And so they went with the really safe stuff,"
00:12:33,00:12:36,which was the light beers and the mass produced stuff.
00:12:36,00:12:38,"- Okay, now can you explain Hershey's?"
00:12:38,00:12:39,- Hershey's.
00:12:39,00:12:40,- Tastes like sick.
00:12:40,00:12:42,- Tastes like sick to British people.
00:12:42,00:12:44,"- Well, you know, it contains some chemicals"
00:12:44,00:12:47,which happen to also taste like sick.
00:12:47,00:12:49,- I don't know how people have gone around tasting sick.
00:12:49,00:12:50,"They haven't, they haven't."
00:12:50,00:12:51,They really haven't.
00:12:51,00:12:52,That's not how it is.
00:12:52,00:12:53,"- Well, if you're eating a Hershey's bar right now,"
00:12:53,00:12:54,please send a photo.
00:12:54,00:12:56,"If you're being sick, if you're, you know."
00:12:56,00:12:58,"- Oh, yes, that one."
00:12:58,00:13:00,- Podcast at qr.com.
00:13:00,00:13:02,- Do they have your address?
00:13:02,00:13:03,"'Cause I feel like if they have your address,"
00:13:03,00:13:05,"they could send the Mangosteans and the sick,"
00:13:05,00:13:07,"et cetera, et cetera, to the address."
00:13:07,00:13:08,- We've just moved offices.
00:13:08,00:13:10,And the reason being that the old office
00:13:10,00:13:12,was just full of sick and Mangosteans.
00:13:12,00:13:13,"- Soon undated, yeah."
00:13:13,00:13:16,But everyone's tasted sick if they've ever been sick.
00:13:16,00:13:16,- True.
00:13:16,00:13:17,- You know.
00:13:17,00:13:18,"- Oh, wow."
00:13:18,00:13:19,"- You just taste it in reverse, don't you?"
00:13:19,00:13:21,"Sorry to, I mean to, you know, to lower the tone."
00:13:21,00:13:22,- That's nasty.
00:13:22,00:13:24,- That's how we know what American chocolate tastes like.
00:13:24,00:13:25,- Yeah.
00:13:25,00:13:26,- Great.
00:13:26,00:13:27,- Thank you.
00:13:27,00:13:30,- Could you guys hear about the cherry blossom trees in DC
00:13:30,00:13:32,"and how he's responsible for all of them, basically?"
00:13:32,00:13:35,"So, I mean, we have them now in London quite a lot."
00:13:35,00:13:37,They're very kind of ornamental and very beautiful.
00:13:37,00:13:38,But he introduced them from Japan.
00:13:38,00:13:41,And then it became all the rage and people were like queuing
00:13:41,00:13:43,up to see him and Alexander Graham Bell's daughters.
00:13:43,00:13:45,"- Is that their house, wasn't it?"
00:13:45,00:13:46,"He put it to his, yeah."
00:13:46,00:13:47,"- Exactly, exactly."
00:13:47,00:13:50,And then basically Washington DC was not the beautiful
00:13:50,00:13:52,metropolis it now is.
00:13:52,00:13:53,Back then it was kind of ugly.
00:13:53,00:13:56,"And he started saying, well, maybe we should just plant"
00:13:56,00:13:58,some cherry blossom trees around here.
00:13:58,00:13:59,And that would be kind of beautiful.
00:13:59,00:14:02,And then the first lady heard of this.
00:14:02,00:14:06,"And before you know it, the Japanese who at this point"
00:14:06,00:14:09,they're not particularly like chummy with.
00:14:09,00:14:11,"They're like, okay, this could be a symbol of friendship."
00:14:11,00:14:13,"If you give us 300 cherry blossom trees,"
00:14:13,00:14:15,we can plant them in DC.
00:14:15,00:14:19,"And the Japanese got carried away, ended up shipping 2000."
00:14:19,00:14:20,But they opened the crate.
00:14:20,00:14:22,"So I think it was in Seattle and went, oh crap,"
00:14:22,00:14:23,they were diseased.
00:14:23,00:14:25,They were absolutely infested with invasive species.
00:14:25,00:14:29,So then they had to publicly burn the symbol of friendship
00:14:29,00:14:31,between Japan and the US.
00:14:31,00:14:33,And it was like on the front page of the New York Times.
00:14:33,00:14:34,- And the thing I read was it was from orders
00:14:34,00:14:37,"of the president, which feels like he should have been busier"
00:14:37,00:14:39,than having to make executive decisions
00:14:39,00:14:42,of agricultural imports.
00:14:42,00:14:43,"- Although it was his decision, wasn't it?"
00:14:43,00:14:46,Because it was him and the first lady who kind of made
00:14:46,00:14:47,"the decision to bring it over, wasn't it?"
00:14:47,00:14:48,- Wow.
00:14:48,00:14:50,"- But the Japanese were like, are bad."
00:14:50,00:14:51,And so it was all fine.
00:14:51,00:14:54,They sent more over and then they are now.
00:14:54,00:14:56,"- And as a result, US-Japanese relations"
00:14:56,00:14:57,"stayed very harmonious, didn't they?"
00:14:57,00:14:58,- Yeah.
00:14:58,00:14:59,"- Yeah, good."
00:14:59,00:15:00,- It was interesting 'cause the ones
00:15:00,00:15:02,"that they sent over the second time,"
00:15:02,00:15:06,they had to make sure that they were really not infested.
00:15:06,00:15:08,So they raised the trees in virgin soil.
00:15:08,00:15:10,So the soil was brand new
00:15:10,00:15:12,and they'd never been anywhere else.
00:15:12,00:15:16,They wrapped the roots in damp moss to stop any--
00:15:16,00:15:18,- It's a long work for a friendship man.
00:15:18,00:15:18,- Yeah.
00:15:18,00:15:21,- That's great.
00:15:21,00:15:26,"And they fumigated it twice, once to asphyxiate the insects"
00:15:26,00:15:28,and then once just in case.
00:15:28,00:15:29,(laughing)
00:15:29,00:15:31,"But yeah, and the reason that they did this"
00:15:31,00:15:34,"is because this guy, a fair child,"
00:15:34,00:15:38,"had a nemesis called Charles Marlatt, didn't he?"
00:15:38,00:15:38,- Yep.
00:15:38,00:15:39,- This is an amazing story.
00:15:39,00:15:43,So Charles Marlatt was in charge of the FDA
00:15:43,00:15:47,"sort of anti-insect part of the FDA,"
00:15:47,00:15:49,but they were boyhood friends.
00:15:49,00:15:53,And actually Marlatt was Fairchild's best man at his wedding.
00:15:53,00:15:56,But then they fell out because Fairchild basically got
00:15:56,00:15:58,"a load of easy jobs through his friends and family,"
00:15:58,00:16:00,he'll have a bit of nepotism and stuff.
00:16:00,00:16:02,And Marlatt had to work hard for his job.
00:16:02,00:16:04,And so they really fell out.
00:16:04,00:16:06,"And Marlatt basically, whenever Fairchild brought in"
00:16:06,00:16:09,"any new species, he would be like,"
00:16:09,00:16:10,"""Does insects on that get rid of it?"
00:16:10,00:16:12,"""Burn it, do it now."""
00:16:12,00:16:13,"And so they really, really fell out."
00:16:13,00:16:15,"- I have to defend the entomologist,"
00:16:15,00:16:17,even though I love doing Fairchild.
00:16:17,00:16:19,"So it's worth saying that like Fairchild,"
00:16:19,00:16:22,"he did get a lot of fame,"
00:16:22,00:16:23,but a lot of that was off his own back.
00:16:23,00:16:25,"But then, yeah, sure, he married into like"
00:16:25,00:16:26,this really prominent family
00:16:26,00:16:28,and became really big with National Geographic.
00:16:28,00:16:31,"But today, we would actually side with the entomologist."
00:16:31,00:16:34,"Like, scientifically, he's the sound one."
00:16:34,00:16:35,"Not the botanist just being like,"
00:16:35,00:16:37,"""Well, let's just hope it's gonna be fine"
00:16:37,00:16:39,"""when we bring all these parts from all over the world."""
00:16:39,00:16:40,"- Yeah, definitely."
00:16:40,00:16:41,"- It was dangerous, yeah."
00:16:41,00:16:43,- I read this amazing story that he wanted to send
00:16:43,00:16:47,"a thousand mangoes back to America,"
00:16:47,00:16:50,but he put them on a boat and they were too heavy.
00:16:50,00:16:54,And so he solved it by getting a load of local children
00:16:54,00:16:55,to eat them all.
00:16:55,00:16:56,- What?
00:16:56,00:16:57,- Because all he needed were the stones.
00:16:57,00:17:00,He didn't need the mangoes themselves.
00:17:00,00:17:02,"So he just got all the kids and said,"
00:17:02,00:17:04,"""Free mangoes as many as you can eat."""
00:17:04,00:17:05,"They all went, ""Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no."""
00:17:05,00:17:06,"- U.S. diplomacy, there we go."
00:17:06,00:17:07,That's another...
00:17:07,00:17:10,"- I thought you were gonna say something really clever,"
00:17:10,00:17:13,"like, ""He only needed to ship the children there."""
00:17:13,00:17:15,- And then they poo the mouse.
00:17:15,00:17:16,"- Exactly, exactly."
00:17:16,00:17:17,"And I was thinking, ""Oh, those children are brave,"
00:17:17,00:17:18,"""like pooing at a mango stone."
00:17:18,00:17:19,"""That's not funny."""
00:17:19,00:17:22,"No, children famously a bit more heavy than a mango as well."
00:17:22,00:17:25,"So, wait was your issue."
00:17:25,00:17:26,"- Oh, no."
00:17:26,00:17:26,I'm sorry.
00:17:26,00:17:35,"- Okay, it's time for fact number two, and that is James."
00:17:35,00:17:37,"- Okay, my fact this week is that up one stage"
00:17:37,00:17:41,"of the 17th century, every woman living on the Yemeni island"
00:17:41,00:17:43,of Sokotra was called Maria.
00:17:43,00:17:45,- Was it?
00:17:45,00:17:46,"Okay, okay."
00:17:46,00:17:48,- How many women were on the island?
00:17:48,00:17:51,"- Well, I don't know, but it wasn't completely insignificant."
00:17:51,00:17:52,"It's a big island, right?"
00:17:52,00:17:53,It's about the size of what you've been there.
00:17:53,00:17:54,- Long Island.
00:17:54,00:17:55,"- It's big, haven't you?"
00:17:55,00:17:56,"- Long Island, yeah, yeah."
00:17:56,00:18:00,- Is it that they were hosting a sound of music reality show?
00:18:00,00:18:01,- In the 17th century.
00:18:01,00:18:02,"- Oh, yeah, yeah."
00:18:02,00:18:04,- I feel like it's a real Yemeni vibe.
00:18:04,00:18:07,It's like the tribesmen and the sound of music.
00:18:07,00:18:10,"- Well, I don't know exactly how many people live there."
00:18:10,00:18:12,How many people do you say live there now?
00:18:12,00:18:13,"It's in the 10, 10,000."
00:18:13,00:18:15,"- I think it's about 40,000."
00:18:15,00:18:16,"- 40,000, yeah."
00:18:16,00:18:17,"It would have been less then,"
00:18:17,00:18:20,but basically it was a Christian island.
00:18:20,00:18:23,"By tradition, it was St. Thomas who was shipwrecked there"
00:18:23,00:18:25,in the year 52 AD.
00:18:25,00:18:27,"And he supposedly brought in Christianity,"
00:18:27,00:18:30,but definitely the Greeks brought in the 4th century
00:18:30,00:18:31,that definitely happened.
00:18:31,00:18:34,And Marco Polo wrote about it in the 13th century
00:18:34,00:18:35,that there were Christians there.
00:18:35,00:18:39,"And in the 17th century, there was a guy called Padre Vincenzo"
00:18:39,00:18:41,and he visited Socatra.
00:18:41,00:18:46,"And he found that they were still Christian ostensibly,"
00:18:46,00:18:48,but they'd kind of moved to other beliefs
00:18:48,00:18:51,"because Socatra is a place it's very difficult to get to,"
00:18:51,00:18:53,"especially at certain times of year,"
00:18:53,00:18:54,you can't really get there at all.
00:18:54,00:18:56,"- The monsoon is, yeah, good luck."
00:18:56,00:18:58,- And so because they were isolated
00:18:58,00:19:00,"from the rest of the world,"
00:19:00,00:19:02,they kind of had this new version of Christianity.
00:19:02,00:19:05,So a lot of them were called Maria.
00:19:05,00:19:07,"There were still a lot of churches,"
00:19:07,00:19:09,"but for instance, they used to do sacrifices to the moon"
00:19:09,00:19:10,and a few different things.
00:19:10,00:19:12,- Why not keep some of your old beliefs in?
00:19:12,00:19:13,Just spice it all up a bit.
00:19:13,00:19:14,What year was that again?
00:19:14,00:19:17,- It was in the mid 17th century.
00:19:17,00:19:18,- Why were they called Maria?
00:19:18,00:19:20,"- Because Mary, the mother of Jesus."
00:19:20,00:19:23,"- Oh, that must have been confusing."
00:19:23,00:19:25,"- Oh, yeah. - No, 'cause they'd..."
00:19:25,00:19:25,- Have you been there?
00:19:25,00:19:27,"- Yeah, so I've been to Socatra."
00:19:27,00:19:30,"It is, I can verify that it's very difficult to get there."
00:19:30,00:19:31,- Have you met a Maria?
00:19:31,00:19:33,- I have not met a Maria
00:19:33,00:19:36,'cause weirdly there's no Christians left on the island.
00:19:36,00:19:38,"- Oh, what's that?"
00:19:38,00:19:39,"- Someone's had Maria, come on."
00:19:39,00:19:43,(all laughing)
00:19:43,00:19:45,- They're all Muslims now.
00:19:45,00:19:49,"- So I went there kind of 2018, I think, or 2019."
00:19:49,00:19:50,And we had three options to get there.
00:19:50,00:19:53,"Either we fly in via mainland Yemen,"
00:19:53,00:19:54,but the airport we were flying into
00:19:54,00:19:56,was on Al Qaeda stronghold.
00:19:56,00:19:59,So decided maybe that's not the best way of getting in.
00:19:59,00:20:02,"And then the other route was via,"
00:20:02,00:20:04,"kind of almost like a private jet via the Emirates,"
00:20:04,00:20:06,the place that you like.
00:20:06,00:20:09,"But they were only giving us verbal permission,"
00:20:09,00:20:10,not written permission.
00:20:10,00:20:14,And then the third option was to get on a cement cargo ship
00:20:14,00:20:17,from Oman and sail through pirate waters.
00:20:17,00:20:19,"And the ship was like infested with cockroaches,"
00:20:19,00:20:20,like completely infested.
00:20:20,00:20:23,"And it had like a, the toilet was like a basket"
00:20:23,00:20:25,"on the side of the ship, like attached with rope."
00:20:25,00:20:26,- Is this the route you went?
00:20:26,00:20:27,- Yeah. - Whoa.
00:20:27,00:20:28,"- Yeah, it was hilarious."
00:20:28,00:20:30,- No pirates?
00:20:30,00:20:33,"- Yeah, we luckily didn't have, you know."
00:20:33,00:20:35,"The Swede in the group had his wits about him,"
00:20:35,00:20:36,"let me tell you that every time,"
00:20:36,00:20:41,every time a ship went past you like just very nervous.
00:20:41,00:20:43,"- But yeah, so it's really hard to get to"
00:20:43,00:20:44,"and that's the thing, right?"
00:20:44,00:20:45,But then that's good news for other things.
00:20:45,00:20:48,So it means that they have amazing biodiversity there.
00:20:48,00:20:50,"- Yeah, you've seen the trees there, there."
00:20:50,00:20:51,- They look incredible.
00:20:51,00:20:52,"I mean, the dragonblood tree,"
00:20:52,00:20:54,"I know that's the most famous really,"
00:20:54,00:20:56,"that's the sort of like the headline tree out there,"
00:20:56,00:20:58,but they do look beautiful.
00:20:58,00:20:58,- They're beautiful.
00:20:58,00:20:59,"- They look, they're described,"
00:20:59,00:21:00,"if you'd want to picture it,"
00:21:00,00:21:02,they're described as sort of looking like umbrellas.
00:21:02,00:21:04,But a lot of them look like umbrellas with a high wind
00:21:04,00:21:07,where you know when your umbrella flips on side out
00:21:07,00:21:09,'cause you see the stems coming up
00:21:09,00:21:12,"and they're known for the fact that if the sap comes out,"
00:21:12,00:21:15,"it's red sap, hence the kind of dragonblood thing."
00:21:15,00:21:17,And they've been exporting that for years
00:21:17,00:21:20,and it's been used for all sorts of like nail polish
00:21:20,00:21:23,and medicines and so on.
00:21:23,00:21:24,- Smirring gladiators?
00:21:24,00:21:25,- Really? - Really?
00:21:25,00:21:27,- I think gladiators supposedly had a bit of it
00:21:27,00:21:30,to smear them as decoration and a bit as disinfectant.
00:21:30,00:21:32,"But the thing is that the tree,"
00:21:32,00:21:34,"I think it only exists there now,"
00:21:34,00:21:37,but pollen has been found all around the Mediterranean
00:21:37,00:21:39,as in fossilized or archeologists
00:21:39,00:21:40,have found pollen of it around the Med.
00:21:40,00:21:43,So this is what the Med used to look like.
00:21:43,00:21:45,There used to be these trees much more commonly.
00:21:45,00:21:46,"- So the dragon's blood tree,"
00:21:46,00:21:48,there's different species of dragon's blood.
00:21:48,00:21:50,And there are still what we call
00:21:50,00:21:52,in biology relic populations.
00:21:52,00:21:55,"So kind of populations that are on their last leg in Socotra,"
00:21:55,00:21:57,but there's different species of dragon's blood
00:21:57,00:21:59,in the Canary Islands.
00:21:59,00:22:00,There's another species in Ouan
00:22:00,00:22:02,and kind of a remote part of Oman.
00:22:02,00:22:04,And it looks like the dragon's blood tree
00:22:04,00:22:07,was like a really dominant tree
00:22:07,00:22:10,in the whole of kind of that old world.
00:22:10,00:22:12,It's kind of old school.
00:22:12,00:22:14,It should kind of really be on its out and it is.
00:22:14,00:22:15,- But it is right.
00:22:15,00:22:17,"They're saying possibly in the next 80 years,"
00:22:17,00:22:18,"if we're not careful,"
00:22:18,00:22:21,it's gonna be an extinct species of tree.
00:22:21,00:22:22,And it's so interesting how it survives
00:22:22,00:22:25,'cause most trees obviously get their water
00:22:25,00:22:26,through the roots under the ground.
00:22:26,00:22:29,But this tree has worked out a way.
00:22:29,00:22:31,"I don't know if that's a language you use about trees,"
00:22:31,00:22:33,but it's got the ability to take in the moisture
00:22:33,00:22:35,of the clouds that are going above it.
00:22:35,00:22:38,"So it can pull from above as well as below,"
00:22:38,00:22:39,which is pretty amazing.
00:22:39,00:22:42,- It injects much more water into the soil
00:22:42,00:22:43,from the air than it gets in rainfall.
00:22:43,00:22:45,'Cause sometimes it's foggy and cloudy
00:22:45,00:22:46,and it sort of sucks all that.
00:22:46,00:22:48,"It's called horizontal precipitation capture,"
00:22:48,00:22:50,which is as it sounds.
00:22:50,00:22:53,But they've got I think 92 different plant species
00:22:53,00:22:54,which live in the undergrowth.
00:22:54,00:22:56,The few surveys have found that.
00:22:56,00:22:58,And seven of them are only found
00:22:58,00:23:00,living in the undergrowth of the dragon's blood tree.
00:23:00,00:23:01,That's mad.
00:23:01,00:23:02,- That's so cool.
00:23:02,00:23:04,- I suppose that would make it an umbrella species.
00:23:04,00:23:05,It looks like an umbrella.
00:23:05,00:23:06,- Oh!
00:23:06,00:23:09,"- I'll tell you what, at National Geographic,"
00:23:09,00:23:10,they go wild for that long.
00:23:10,00:23:11,"- Yeah, yeah."
00:23:11,00:23:12,"- I mean, when you turn up there,"
00:23:12,00:23:15,"I'm not gonna lie, you're like, what is this place?"
00:23:15,00:23:17,"It looks, there's so few places on Earth"
00:23:17,00:23:18,"where you look at them and you go,"
00:23:18,00:23:19,"""Oh, that looks really alien."""
00:23:19,00:23:22,Like that's a really unusual landscape.
00:23:22,00:23:25,"And cicotra is definitely that, like these canyons,"
00:23:25,00:23:27,"like Grand Canyon or more obviously not that scale,"
00:23:27,00:23:29,but with these dragon blood trees.
00:23:29,00:23:31,"And other trees as well, you know,"
00:23:31,00:23:32,and giant snails and a bunch of stuff
00:23:32,00:23:34,"that you're just like, ""What is this?"""
00:23:34,00:23:35,"- Well, Ella, I can ask you,"
00:23:35,00:23:37,"as the only one who's been there,"
00:23:37,00:23:40,did it seem to you at all like the atmosphere
00:23:40,00:23:45,of the planet Pandora in the global mega hit avatar films?
00:23:45,00:23:49,"- Okay, okay, actually this is a good crowd"
00:23:49,00:23:52,"to ask this because I've heard that as well,"
00:23:52,00:23:54,but that was an inspiration.
00:23:54,00:23:57,And I wondered if we knew what the source of that was
00:23:57,00:23:59,"because I could, here's the thing,"
00:23:59,00:24:00,"the thing with cicotra is,"
00:24:00,00:24:02,"if you speak to people that are really in the know,"
00:24:02,00:24:05,"so people, the kind of off the beat travelers,"
00:24:05,00:24:08,"people that are very interested in kind of biology,"
00:24:08,00:24:09,"that kind of thing, they all know cicotra."
00:24:09,00:24:11,It's like this hidden secret
00:24:11,00:24:14,that actually everybody in a certain industry knows about.
00:24:14,00:24:17,"Like, you know, and it's on people's dreams."
00:24:17,00:24:18,I've met very rich people
00:24:18,00:24:19,that are desperate for me to take them to cicotra.
00:24:19,00:24:21,"And I'm like, sure, once I've dealt with the pirate situation,"
00:24:21,00:24:23,"I will get you, and you're very rich."
00:24:23,00:24:27,- Cue of wizards Texans just waiting to be.
00:24:27,00:24:28,"- But yeah, I wondered about that"
00:24:28,00:24:30,"because I was like, I can see that,"
00:24:30,00:24:31,but I just wonder what the source is.
00:24:31,00:24:34,"'Cause I just, being that we care about fact here, guys,"
00:24:34,00:24:35,right? - Yeah.
00:24:35,00:24:36,- Right? - Yeah.
00:24:36,00:24:37,- Right? - Sure.
00:24:37,00:24:37,- I need more.
00:24:37,00:24:39,"- Well, there's one thing we care about more than facts,"
00:24:39,00:24:40,and that's the continued success
00:24:40,00:24:42,of the way of water franchise.
00:24:42,00:24:44,(laughing)
00:24:44,00:24:45,"Nevermind, nevermind, nevermind."
00:24:45,00:24:48,"- Just on the Christianity in Yemen in the 17th century,"
00:24:48,00:24:52,this was what Padre Vincenza was talking about.
00:24:52,00:24:53,A few weird things that they did.
00:24:53,00:24:56,"They had a priest called Adambo,"
00:24:56,00:24:58,who was elected by the people
00:24:58,00:25:00,and changed every single year.
00:25:00,00:25:03,Just like almost like an archbishop of the island.
00:25:03,00:25:05,- But democratic. - But democratic.
00:25:05,00:25:06,"That's quite cool, isn't it?"
00:25:06,00:25:07,"- Yeah, very cool."
00:25:07,00:25:08,- Let me tell you about modern day Yemen.
00:25:08,00:25:10,(laughing)
00:25:10,00:25:12,"- The other thing is, in the churches,"
00:25:12,00:25:15,"they had like a, what would you call it, like an altar,"
00:25:15,00:25:18,and every day they would smear it with butter.
00:25:18,00:25:19,"- Oh, lovely."
00:25:19,00:25:20,- That does sound kind of--
00:25:20,00:25:21,- What for what reason?
00:25:21,00:25:22,"- Yeah, do they slide along it?"
00:25:22,00:25:24,(laughing)
00:25:24,00:25:25,'Cause that would be a great way
00:25:25,00:25:27,"of starting a service, wouldn't it?"
00:25:27,00:25:28,"- You know, whoosh, I'm here."
00:25:28,00:25:30,"- Was it sort of like, you're going up for your body of Christ?"
00:25:30,00:25:32,Would you like some butter?
00:25:32,00:25:33,(laughing)
00:25:33,00:25:34,- I don't know how this is just the fantasies
00:25:34,00:25:36,of these two heathens.
00:25:36,00:25:39,That's what would take those two heathens back to church.
00:25:39,00:25:41,- I've got a general Yemen fact.
00:25:41,00:25:42,"- Oh, yeah. - Yeah."
00:25:42,00:25:44,"- During, so Yemen, I think,"
00:25:44,00:25:46,used to be a British colony protectorate.
00:25:46,00:25:47,- Protectorate the south of it.
00:25:47,00:25:49,- That's safe to say about anywhere in the world.
00:25:49,00:25:50,- Yeah.
00:25:50,00:25:51,(laughing)
00:25:51,00:25:53,- The British were involved in something.
00:25:53,00:25:54,"- Well, you know, yeah."
00:25:54,00:25:58,"- So during that era, the port of Aden, which was,"
00:25:58,00:26:01,"and I think even after the rest of Yemen might have gained it,"
00:26:01,00:26:03,"it depends, Aden maintained a kind of special status."
00:26:03,00:26:07,"Basically, Aden was in a pretty constant state of emergency."
00:26:07,00:26:08,Things were so dicey there
00:26:08,00:26:10,that British citizens living there were issued
00:26:10,00:26:13,pretty much as standard with revolvers
00:26:13,00:26:15,in case of assassination attempts on them.
00:26:15,00:26:16,"Imagine that, imagine just moving to somewhere"
00:26:16,00:26:18,and being fitted with a revolver.
00:26:18,00:26:19,"- Yeah, Yemen's an interesting place."
00:26:19,00:26:22,"Like, during, so there was a revolution"
00:26:22,00:26:24,and obviously now there's a war.
00:26:24,00:26:27,"And there was like a protest and outside the protest,"
00:26:27,00:26:29,"it says, ""No bazookas."""
00:26:29,00:26:30,(laughing)
00:26:30,00:26:31,- So you were allowed to...
00:26:31,00:26:31,- Wow.
00:26:31,00:26:33,(laughing)
00:26:33,00:26:34,"- Other way, but just no bazookas."
00:26:34,00:26:37,"We're drawing the line of, oh, and land mines."
00:26:37,00:26:39,"They were like, ""No bazookas and no hand grenades."""
00:26:39,00:26:40,- Oh my God.
00:26:40,00:26:41,- That's so funny.
00:26:41,00:26:42,"'Cause like, we just had protests here."
00:26:42,00:26:43,And if you brought like a...
00:26:43,00:26:44,- A whistle.
00:26:44,00:26:45,"- A whistle or a luggage tag,"
00:26:45,00:26:48,they'd kind of ship your way to prison.
00:26:48,00:26:48,"- Yeah, no, no, no, no."
00:26:48,00:26:50,"But in defense of my parents' home land,"
00:26:50,00:26:52,"I will say it is a,"
00:26:52,00:26:54,have you seen pictures of mainland Yemen
00:26:54,00:26:55,and the island of Scotland?
00:26:55,00:26:57,It's the most stunning place.
00:26:57,00:26:59,"And I know, like, I'm biased,"
00:26:59,00:27:01,but it is absolutely absolutely beautiful.
00:27:01,00:27:02,- I saw a photo of a place.
00:27:02,00:27:03,I wonder if you've seen it in person.
00:27:03,00:27:05,"You've been there quite a few times, right?"
00:27:05,00:27:07,It's described as the Manhattan of the desert.
00:27:07,00:27:08,- Yes.
00:27:08,00:27:09,"- I mean, it sounds incredible."
00:27:09,00:27:11,"That was Freya Stark, explorer who called it that"
00:27:11,00:27:12,in the 1930s.
00:27:12,00:27:16,But this is a 16th century walled city
00:27:16,00:27:18,that was the first ever city of skyscrapers.
00:27:18,00:27:20,They went seven floors high
00:27:20,00:27:23,and the buildings were made of mud.
00:27:23,00:27:24,It was just a mud trouble.
00:27:24,00:27:25,- And higher actually.
00:27:25,00:27:25,"- Yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:27:25,00:27:27,"- And there's still, obviously,"
00:27:27,00:27:29,"there's been renovations and so on,"
00:27:29,00:27:30,but is there anything original?
00:27:30,00:27:31,"- Oh, it's all there."
00:27:31,00:27:33,"Yeah, so it's a UNESCO World Heritage Site."
00:27:33,00:27:34,"Again, so it's,"
00:27:34,00:27:36,so Sokotra is also a UNESCO World Heritage Site.
00:27:36,00:27:38,"And it's basically buildings,"
00:27:38,00:27:40,"10, 11, whatever, stories high."
00:27:40,00:27:43,The really cute thing is that
00:27:43,00:27:46,some of those houses have bridges
00:27:46,00:27:47,on the top of the houses
00:27:47,00:27:48,because people can't be bothered
00:27:48,00:27:49,to go all the way downstairs.
00:27:49,00:27:49,'Cause I have elevators.
00:27:49,00:27:52,"They're like, right, historic buildings, right?"
00:27:52,00:27:53,"So they, instead of going all the way"
00:27:53,00:27:54,"downstairs to go visit the neighbors,"
00:27:54,00:27:56,"they just go to the top,"
00:27:56,00:27:57,which they call the drill band.
00:27:57,00:28:00,They just leg it along these little bridges.
00:28:00,00:28:01,"- But the thing is, it's so old"
00:28:01,00:28:02,and it's still inhabited.
00:28:02,00:28:02,That's the amazing.
00:28:02,00:28:03,"- Oh, no, no, it's inhabited."
00:28:03,00:28:04,It's completely inhabited.
00:28:04,00:28:06,It's a lived in and World Heritage Site.
00:28:06,00:28:07,It's great.
00:28:07,00:28:08,"I mean, when you turn up there,"
00:28:08,00:28:09,"you're like, are you kidding?"
00:28:09,00:28:12,"So bazookas and pistols, yes,"
00:28:12,00:28:14,but also heritage.
00:28:14,00:28:14,- It was the...
00:28:14,00:28:16,"- Go visit, guys."
00:28:16,00:28:18,- It was the only place you could get coffee from
00:28:18,00:28:21,for 200 years until one of these people
00:28:21,00:28:24,who stole plants went in.
00:28:24,00:28:25,(laughing)
00:28:25,00:28:25,"- You're hero, Zala."
00:28:25,00:28:27,"- Suddenly, I don't like them."
00:28:27,00:28:29,"Went in, nicked all the coffee."
00:28:29,00:28:32,"And if Mocha, which is the place"
00:28:32,00:28:34,"where the coffee was exported from,"
00:28:34,00:28:36,"if they still had the monopoly on coffee,"
00:28:36,00:28:38,there would be enough money for everyone in Yemen
00:28:38,00:28:41,"to get a payment of $16,000 per year"
00:28:41,00:28:42,on top of anything else they earned.
00:28:42,00:28:43,- Are you kidding me?
00:28:43,00:28:44,- And that would be eight times higher
00:28:44,00:28:47,than the actual average salary of a person from Yemen.
00:28:47,00:28:48,- Wow.
00:28:48,00:28:49,- So yeah.
00:28:49,00:28:53,Just one more thing on Marys.
00:28:53,00:28:54,- Oh yeah.
00:28:54,00:28:56,"- At the end of the 18th century,"
00:28:56,00:28:58,24% of women in England were called Mary.
00:28:58,00:29:01,"- The secotra of the North, so called it."
00:29:01,00:29:02,(laughing)
00:29:02,00:29:04,"- And in Vexan, which is in France,"
00:29:04,00:29:06,"just Northwest of Paris,"
00:29:06,00:29:11,"in 1740, 68.4% of women were called Mary."
00:29:11,00:29:13,- What?
00:29:13,00:29:15,"- Or Marie, it would be."
00:29:15,00:29:17,- Do any of you have Marys in your family?
00:29:17,00:29:18,- I have a cousin.
00:29:18,00:29:20,"- Yeah, my, Rosemary is my auntie."
00:29:20,00:29:22,"So there's, yeah, I wonder if it's that,"
00:29:22,00:29:23,if it's the double barrel first.
00:29:23,00:29:25,"- Well, in France, that's what happens."
00:29:25,00:29:27,"So around that time, around the 18th century,"
00:29:27,00:29:29,"they started doing the double names,"
00:29:29,00:29:32,"so you could have Marie Claire or Marie, whatever."
00:29:32,00:29:35,"And yeah, so they started almost,"
00:29:35,00:29:36,everyone was called Marie something.
00:29:36,00:29:37,- Oh.
00:29:37,00:29:42,"- In 1379, 33% of the male population of Sheffield"
00:29:42,00:29:46,"were called John, and 22% of the women were called Alice."
00:29:46,00:29:49,- John and Alice have invited us round.
00:29:49,00:29:50,- Be more specific!
00:29:50,00:29:52,(laughing)
00:29:52,00:29:53,- That's us!
00:29:53,00:29:55,(laughing)
00:29:55,00:29:58,(upbeat music)
00:29:58,00:30:02,"- Okay, it is time for fact number three,"
00:30:02,00:30:04,and that is Andy.
00:30:04,00:30:06,"- My fact is that during the Second World War,"
00:30:06,00:30:09,the making of Spitfires was so secret
00:30:09,00:30:10,that one married couple didn't know
00:30:10,00:30:12,they were both working on it.
00:30:12,00:30:13,- Was that John and Alice?
00:30:13,00:30:14,- It was John and Alice.
00:30:14,00:30:15,- That's cool.
00:30:15,00:30:16,- It's so weird.
00:30:16,00:30:17,- I wonder if they both thought
00:30:17,00:30:19,that the other was having enough.
00:30:19,00:30:20,"- I know, imagine them going to work in the morning,"
00:30:20,00:30:22,playing off to work.
00:30:22,00:30:23,"- Yeah, me too."
00:30:23,00:30:25,- Okay. - See you later.
00:30:25,00:30:26,- I'm going in this direction.
00:30:26,00:30:27,- Oh.
00:30:27,00:30:29,(laughing)
00:30:29,00:30:31,- I'll just pop back to the house for a minute.
00:30:31,00:30:32,"- Who's there somewhere at work,"
00:30:32,00:30:35,whose job it was to keep them apart as well?
00:30:35,00:30:38,A nightmare life of the coming to the canteen
00:30:38,00:30:38,at the same time.
00:30:38,00:30:41,"Oh, hey, what are you coming for?"
00:30:42,00:30:43,- It's such a weird fact.
00:30:43,00:30:44,- How did they find out?
00:30:44,00:30:45,So many questions.
00:30:45,00:30:46,- They found out decades later.
00:30:46,00:30:47,That's the crazy thing.
00:30:47,00:30:48,So this is a slight--
00:30:48,00:30:50,- Was that the only secret thing they were working?
00:30:50,00:30:51,I have so many questions.
00:30:51,00:30:52,Was that the only secret thing they were working on?
00:30:52,00:30:53,- I think they were both working
00:30:53,00:30:54,in this specific factory.
00:30:54,00:30:56,- The same factory even?
00:30:56,00:30:58,"- Yeah, it was the same factory, yeah, yeah."
00:30:58,00:30:58,But so this is--
00:30:58,00:31:00,"- I mean, they might be idiots, guys."
00:31:00,00:31:02,(laughing)
00:31:02,00:31:04,"- Basically, for anyone who doesn't know,"
00:31:04,00:31:05,"we're talking about the Spitfire,"
00:31:05,00:31:07,the Super Marine Spitfires legendary plane
00:31:07,00:31:10,"of the Second World War and big thing in Britain,"
00:31:10,00:31:13,"a kind of national myth item in Britain, the Spitfire."
00:31:13,00:31:14,"And there was a factory in Southampton,"
00:31:14,00:31:17,"which made, I think, most of the Spitfires,"
00:31:17,00:31:19,"and it was bombed in 1940 by the Luftwaffe,"
00:31:19,00:31:21,"and it was not just bombed, it was flattened,"
00:31:21,00:31:23,and this was a disaster.
00:31:23,00:31:25,"And they needed to work out how to, you know,"
00:31:25,00:31:26,"keep Spitfire production going,"
00:31:26,00:31:28,but keep it safe from bombing raids.
00:31:28,00:31:29,"And what they did was they said,"
00:31:29,00:31:31,"well, we'll make it in secret."
00:31:31,00:31:32,"And not only that, we'll divide all the factories"
00:31:32,00:31:35,"into, you know, lots of different tiny micro factories"
00:31:35,00:31:37,"around the place, which are all hidden."
00:31:37,00:31:39,"So they used all sorts of little offices or garages,"
00:31:39,00:31:43,"a laundry, an old glove factory, they just divide,"
00:31:43,00:31:45,"it was amazing, they just divided it up."
00:31:45,00:31:47,And lots of them were in Salisbury and Reading
00:31:47,00:31:49,"and Trowbridge and just like all over the place, basically."
00:31:49,00:31:51,"And this came out decades after the war,"
00:31:51,00:31:54,"that this is how it had been done, basically."
00:31:54,00:31:56,And there was an engineer who worked on them
00:31:56,00:31:58,"called Norman Parker, and he said in 2021,"
00:31:58,00:32:00,he was interviewed about it.
00:32:00,00:32:02,He was about 95 at the time that he was talking about this.
00:32:02,00:32:04,"He said, ""We had one case, there was a couple"
00:32:04,00:32:06,"at a dinner party in the 1970s,"
00:32:06,00:32:07,"and over the dinner table, the wife said,"
00:32:07,00:32:11,"""Oh, I was building Spitfires in Salisbury during the war."""
00:32:11,00:32:14,"And the husband said, ""No, you weren't, I was."""
00:32:14,00:32:16,And they had both been working in the same factory
00:32:16,00:32:16,and they didn't know it.
00:32:16,00:32:19,"- It could be a false memory, I guess."
00:32:19,00:32:21,"- I think this is a really bad marriage, guys."
00:32:21,00:32:22,- Yeah.
00:32:22,00:32:23,- I've got-
00:32:23,00:32:24,"- Well, there are a number of things"
00:32:24,00:32:25,"it could have been, but basically."
00:32:25,00:32:27,(laughing)
00:32:27,00:32:27,- Yeah.
00:32:27,00:32:29,- I reckon I have things with my siblings
00:32:29,00:32:32,"that we talk about when we were really, really young."
00:32:32,00:32:34,And we all think that we were the one
00:32:34,00:32:35,who did a certain thing.
00:32:35,00:32:36,"- Oh, right."
00:32:36,00:32:37,- Do you know what I mean?
00:32:37,00:32:38,"- Yeah, I see, you're throwing shade on the-"
00:32:38,00:32:40,"- I'm not saying that's true, but I'm just saying,"
00:32:40,00:32:44,"I remember I was, my brother was locked in a toilet"
00:32:44,00:32:46,in France when we went to a restaurant once
00:32:46,00:32:47,and we had to get him out.
00:32:47,00:32:49,And then he thinks it was my sister who was that.
00:32:49,00:32:50,Do you know what I mean?
00:32:50,00:32:52,"So it's like, weirdo."
00:32:52,00:32:53,"- Yeah, yeah."
00:32:53,00:32:56,- Or it could be that they're telling the truth
00:32:56,00:32:57,and it's a real thing.
00:32:57,00:32:58,(laughing)
00:32:58,00:33:00,- Do we know what they worked on specifically?
00:33:00,00:33:01,"- Well, that's the other thing,"
00:33:01,00:33:03,production was divvied up in lots of ways.
00:33:03,00:33:06,So it might have been by same factory.
00:33:06,00:33:08,"It was a factory, it was at different sites"
00:33:08,00:33:10,"or it was a, you know, they probably weren't in the same room."
00:33:10,00:33:12,- He could have been making the leather chairs
00:33:12,00:33:14,"for what could be used for a car, but it was for a plane."
00:33:14,00:33:15,And as in like-
00:33:15,00:33:16,"- Sure, yeah, yeah."
00:33:16,00:33:16,"- That's what I mean, to the level"
00:33:16,00:33:17,of what were they making.
00:33:17,00:33:18,"- Exactly, yeah."
00:33:18,00:33:19,- The spitfire.
00:33:19,00:33:20,"- It's plausible, for sure."
00:33:20,00:33:21,"- Yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:33:21,00:33:22,"- I mean, it's-"
00:33:22,00:33:22,- I think they sort of dug into it.
00:33:22,00:33:23,- And everyone was very secretive.
00:33:23,00:33:24,- And people were very secretive.
00:33:24,00:33:26,"Or you might know in a couple,"
00:33:26,00:33:27,I'm working on something that's secret
00:33:27,00:33:29,and I can't really tell you what it's about.
00:33:29,00:33:31,And they're both in war work.
00:33:31,00:33:33,"And the thing is about aviation, during the Second World War,"
00:33:33,00:33:36,65% of the aviation workforce were women
00:33:36,00:33:38,because most of the men were in the arm.
00:33:38,00:33:40,"- So statistically, she's more likely to be correct."
00:33:40,00:33:41,"- Absolutely, yeah."
00:33:41,00:33:44,"Like I say, I think they're both correct."
00:33:44,00:33:46,"- So she's told this guy at the dinner table,"
00:33:46,00:33:48,"he's gone, wow, what an amazing life."
00:33:48,00:33:49,What did you do?
00:33:49,00:33:50,"Yeah, yes, spitfires as well."
00:33:50,00:33:52,(laughing)
00:33:52,00:33:54,"- So anyway, the spitfire."
00:33:54,00:33:55,- Spitfire is amazing.
00:33:55,00:33:56,- So are you into the spitfire?
00:33:56,00:33:57,- Yeah.
00:33:57,00:33:58,"- 'Cause I feel like I don't,"
00:33:58,00:34:01,"I feel, how do I put this politely?"
00:34:01,00:34:02,- The people that talk about spitfires a lot
00:34:02,00:34:04,tend to be a few years older than you.
00:34:04,00:34:05,- Thank you.
00:34:05,00:34:06,That's actually a compliment guys.
00:34:06,00:34:07,"I don't know if you heard that was,"
00:34:07,00:34:09,(laughing)
00:34:09,00:34:12,I'm young seeming for a guy as interested in spitfires.
00:34:12,00:34:14,(laughing)
00:34:14,00:34:17,"- Shit, my teacher at school when I was a kid,"
00:34:17,00:34:19,"was an older guy, was really into spitfires."
00:34:19,00:34:21,"- I think actually, Ella, you'll find,"
00:34:21,00:34:23,the more that you meet Andy and talk to him.
00:34:23,00:34:24,- He's an old man.
00:34:24,00:34:26,"- Well, a lot of the things he's interested in,"
00:34:26,00:34:28,you would expect older men to be interested in.
00:34:28,00:34:29,- Is that fair to say?
00:34:29,00:34:31,"- I think it's not, I'm fair."
00:34:31,00:34:33,(laughing)
00:34:33,00:34:35,"I'm not really, I'm not deeply into them,"
00:34:35,00:34:37,but I am interested in logistics.
00:34:37,00:34:40,(laughing)
00:34:40,00:34:41,"- So for those who can't see this,"
00:34:41,00:34:43,he might be shaking a little bit.
00:34:43,00:34:44,(laughing)
00:34:44,00:34:45,"I'm not really, really into it."
00:34:45,00:34:47,- I'm trembling with joy.
00:34:47,00:34:47,"Yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:34:47,00:34:49,"I had a look at, just, you know,"
00:34:49,00:34:51,we check what we've talked about before in this podcast.
00:34:51,00:34:53,"I had a look, I can't believe you guys have stopped me"
00:34:53,00:34:56,for nine years from ever mentioning the spitfire
00:34:56,00:34:56,on this show.
00:34:56,00:34:57,We've never mentioned that.
00:34:57,00:34:58,"- Well done guys, high five for the rest of the day."
00:34:58,00:35:00,(laughing)
00:35:00,00:35:01,- Great place.
00:35:01,00:35:03,"- Yeah, incredible plane and also,"
00:35:03,00:35:06,what a group effort of the UK during wartime
00:35:06,00:35:08,to make this plane built to the numbers
00:35:08,00:35:09,that it was built at.
00:35:09,00:35:11,"Basically, there was, I was reading an article saying"
00:35:11,00:35:14,that it was effectively like one of the early kick starters
00:35:14,00:35:16,"where people funded,"
00:35:16,00:35:19,coal communities would go around funding single planes
00:35:19,00:35:21,"and they, as a result, got to name the plane."
00:35:21,00:35:23,So lots of the planes flying that were in the war
00:35:23,00:35:26,had names like Dorothy of Great Britain and Empire
00:35:26,00:35:29,and that was funded entirely by women called Dorothy.
00:35:29,00:35:32,"So, it's so, yes, it's so funny."
00:35:32,00:35:33,- Maria plane.
00:35:33,00:35:35,"- Yeah, by the fact that 70% of women"
00:35:35,00:35:36,were called Dorothy.
00:35:36,00:35:38,(laughing)
00:35:38,00:35:41,- There was the dog fighter as well.
00:35:41,00:35:43,"There was, and that was the Kennel Club"
00:35:43,00:35:44,"who had funded that. - All right,"
00:35:44,00:35:45,it wasn't people who did dog fighting.
00:35:45,00:35:46,(laughing)
00:35:46,00:35:48,Think for the back of the pub.
00:35:48,00:35:51,"- But check this out, this is the most incredible one."
00:35:51,00:35:54,There was one that was POWs of Oflag.
00:35:54,00:35:55,This is a prison camp in Germany
00:35:55,00:35:59,with captured officers who donated their month's pay
00:35:59,00:36:00,through the Red Cross.
00:36:00,00:36:02,Then that went into the building of a plane.
00:36:02,00:36:06,So they were in prison and they were funding the plane.
00:36:06,00:36:07,- That was war actually.
00:36:07,00:36:10,- I read about that and they had to send letters back
00:36:10,00:36:14,"saying I want to give my money to this crowdfunding, right?"
00:36:14,00:36:16,But they had to do it in code.
00:36:16,00:36:18,"So, because you couldn't send a message"
00:36:18,00:36:20,"that the Germans will be able to read saying,"
00:36:20,00:36:22,please put all my money into spitfires.
00:36:22,00:36:24,"Otherwise they're just gonna accidentally lose it, aren't they?"
00:36:24,00:36:26,"- Yeah, exactly. - It's amazing."
00:36:26,00:36:27,"- It was, that was a really nice thing,"
00:36:27,00:36:30,"this crowdfunding effort, which I had not heard of."
00:36:30,00:36:31,"- What would they have called it back then, though?"
00:36:31,00:36:32,It wouldn't have been crowdfunding.
00:36:32,00:36:34,- They were called Spitfire Funds.
00:36:34,00:36:36,And the planes were kind of arbitrarily priced.
00:36:36,00:36:38,"They said 5,000 pounds will buy a Spitfire,"
00:36:38,00:36:40,"which was not actually a true figure,"
00:36:40,00:36:41,but it sort of was a peg for people too.
00:36:41,00:36:43,"- But also that thing of charities,"
00:36:43,00:36:44,"these days they would say,"
00:36:44,00:36:46,two pounds will buy a meal for one person.
00:36:46,00:36:48,"- Yeah, it was like six pounds will buy a rivet."
00:36:48,00:36:49,"- Exactly. - And 2,000 pounds"
00:36:49,00:36:50,will get you a wing.
00:36:50,00:36:51,- No.
00:36:51,00:36:53,- So you can see what you were buying.
00:36:53,00:36:54,- They raised a lot of money.
00:36:54,00:36:56,It was nearly given a much less sexy name
00:36:56,00:36:57,than the Spitfire.
00:36:57,00:36:59,Spitfire's quite a swashbuckling name.
00:36:59,00:37:03,"Other contenders included Scarab, Shrike,"
00:37:03,00:37:04,"which is quite good, 'cause that's a bird"
00:37:04,00:37:07,"that impales its prey, and it's quite sort of..."
00:37:07,00:37:10,"But I looked up the complete list of Super Marine aircraft,"
00:37:10,00:37:12,and there were some many bad options
00:37:12,00:37:14,that the Spitfire could have been called.
00:37:14,00:37:16,"There was the Super Marine Commercial Amphibian,"
00:37:16,00:37:18,"the Super Marine Sea Urchin,"
00:37:18,00:37:20,"Super Marine Spiteful, quite good,"
00:37:20,00:37:24,"the Super Marine Seagull, Super Marine Sea Otter."
00:37:24,00:37:25,"- No, no, no, they're taking the..."
00:37:25,00:37:29,"- No, they're a rip, and the Super Marine Baby."
00:37:29,00:37:30,"- Oh, yeah. - Oh, yeah."
00:37:30,00:37:31,"- I know. - In a brainstorm,"
00:37:31,00:37:33,sometimes there are bad ideas.
00:37:33,00:37:35,"- Unleash the babies, yeah, yeah."
00:37:35,00:37:36,"But they mostly began with this,"
00:37:36,00:37:38,and they were mostly sea planes.
00:37:38,00:37:39,"That's what they started out as,"
00:37:39,00:37:41,"the firm started out making sea planes and so, yeah."
00:37:41,00:37:44,"- I love sea planes. - Yeah, they're cool."
00:37:44,00:37:47,- Imagine they're a plane where you can just land anywhere.
00:37:47,00:37:50,"As long as there's a body of water, you just land."
00:37:50,00:37:51,- So not on land.
00:37:51,00:37:52,"- Yeah, well, yeah."
00:37:52,00:37:54,"- No, no, no, no, sorry."
00:37:54,00:37:55,- I'm sorry.
00:37:55,00:37:57,- Dan suddenly brings the facts.
00:37:57,00:37:59,- You get special life jackets in case you land on land.
00:37:59,00:38:01,"- Yeah, yeah, exactly."
00:38:01,00:38:06,"- These Super Marine Spitfires,"
00:38:06,00:38:08,"when they were taxiing,"
00:38:08,00:38:10,"so just kind of driving around the airport,"
00:38:10,00:38:12,"they were quite often sort of,"
00:38:12,00:38:15,"not overturned, but get really wobbly."
00:38:15,00:38:17,And so what would happen is someone would often sit
00:38:17,00:38:19,"on the tail of the plane to keep them steady,"
00:38:19,00:38:21,"and it was often a woman who did this,"
00:38:21,00:38:24,and there was a particular woman called Margaret Horton
00:38:24,00:38:28,"who did this in 1943 at RAF, Heibaldstow,"
00:38:28,00:38:29,and she was sat on the back
00:38:29,00:38:32,and the guy was a little bit anxious to get in the air
00:38:32,00:38:34,and forgot to get her off the tail.
00:38:34,00:38:35,"- No, no, no."
00:38:35,00:38:36,- So started taking off
00:38:36,00:38:39,while she was sitting on the tail of the Spitfire.
00:38:39,00:38:43,"And he radioed down to traffic controls saying,"
00:38:43,00:38:46,there's something wrong with this plane.
00:38:46,00:38:48,It's kind of really heavy.
00:38:48,00:38:50,"- And so they talked him down,"
00:38:50,00:38:54,but they never told him that there was a woman on the back.
00:38:54,00:38:55,"- Oh, no way."
00:38:55,00:38:57,"- Well, because as soon as they tell him,"
00:38:57,00:38:58,he's gonna be--
00:38:58,00:38:58,"- Yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:38:58,00:38:59,- So true.
00:38:59,00:39:01,"- So they're like, oh yeah, there's obviously a problem"
00:39:01,00:39:04,"with the wing, we'll just talk you down on how to get down."
00:39:04,00:39:06,And so he never knew until he landed that this woman was--
00:39:06,00:39:07,- Bloody hell.
00:39:07,00:39:08,- And she survived.
00:39:08,00:39:10,"- She survived, yeah, yeah."
00:39:10,00:39:11,- She survived.
00:39:11,00:39:14,There's a museum called Tagmeer Military Aviation Museum.
00:39:14,00:39:15,"And when you go to it,"
00:39:15,00:39:16,there's a model that they've made.
00:39:16,00:39:19,So you can see a model of a Spitfire taking off
00:39:19,00:39:20,with this woman.
00:39:20,00:39:22,- A little plasticine woman
00:39:22,00:39:24,or whatever the material is holding on the tail wing.
00:39:24,00:39:26,- It's so funny.
00:39:26,00:39:27,- It's so brilliant.
00:39:27,00:39:30,- Should we say why it was so good?
00:39:30,00:39:32,"- I'm intrigued, yeah."
00:39:32,00:39:34,"So apparently all the pilots loved it,"
00:39:34,00:39:36,"but I'm like, why, why did they all love it?"
00:39:36,00:39:38,"- Well, it was really nimble."
00:39:38,00:39:40,"It turned very, very fast."
00:39:40,00:39:41,"And also the other thing about it was,"
00:39:41,00:39:43,"it was, you know, it's like,"
00:39:43,00:39:45,"if you guys want to tease me when I say this bit,"
00:39:45,00:39:46,"I don't mind, right?"
00:39:46,00:39:50,"But basically they had flush riveting, which is a good--"
00:39:50,00:39:52,(laughing)
00:39:52,00:39:54,"Okay, talk amongst yourselves."
00:39:54,00:39:56,Dear listener.
00:39:56,00:39:59,"No, so metal skin, very, very cool."
00:39:59,00:40:01,"But if you had lumpy rivets all over it,"
00:40:01,00:40:02,"which most planes did before that,"
00:40:02,00:40:04,it drags the plane back a bit.
00:40:04,00:40:07,"Whereas if you sink, you use the little countersunk rivets,"
00:40:07,00:40:09,so you can see where it's going to go.
00:40:09,00:40:10,"So it's like, what's going on?"
00:40:10,00:40:12,"If you sink, you use the little countersunk rivets,"
00:40:12,00:40:14,"so you sort of, it's exactly level"
00:40:14,00:40:15,"with the surface of the plane,"
00:40:15,00:40:17,then the airflow is very efficient
00:40:17,00:40:19,and you get a much faster plane.
00:40:19,00:40:21,And they did some experiments on early spitfires.
00:40:21,00:40:22,They replicated what it would be like
00:40:22,00:40:26,if it had external rivets by gluing split peas
00:40:26,00:40:28,onto the spots where the rivets were all over the plane
00:40:28,00:40:31,"and then flying it, doing a speed test, basically."
00:40:31,00:40:33,"And it was about 20, 22 miles an hour slower."
00:40:33,00:40:35,"It was a fair chunk slower,"
00:40:35,00:40:37,which would have had a serious effect
00:40:37,00:40:39,"if you were in a combat situation, you know."
00:40:39,00:40:40,So yeah.
00:40:40,00:40:42,- Couldn't you have stopped the enemy
00:40:42,00:40:45,by going in and putting peas on his plane?
00:40:45,00:40:46,- Definitely.
00:40:46,00:40:50,"That was a big part of the early SIS job was, yeah."
00:40:50,00:40:52,- I used to do that and so did my wife.
00:40:52,00:40:53,(laughing)
00:40:53,00:40:56,- So that fact would be even more impressive
00:40:56,00:40:57,if I knew what a rivet was.
00:40:57,00:40:59,(hissing)
00:40:59,00:41:00,- Yeah.
00:41:00,00:41:03,"Well, you've got to retain some mystery, I'm afraid."
00:41:03,00:41:06,"- That's still under the secrets act, actually."
00:41:06,00:41:07,- What the hell's a rivet?
00:41:07,00:41:09,"- A kind of screw, kind of screw."
00:41:09,00:41:10,- Like a big old screw.
00:41:10,00:41:11,- It joins the bits of the plane
00:41:11,00:41:12,to the other bits of the plane.
00:41:12,00:41:14,- I'm googling rivet.
00:41:14,00:41:15,- That's so funny.
00:41:15,00:41:16,- You know the word riveting?
00:41:16,00:41:18,It's got nothing to do with what a rivet is.
00:41:18,00:41:19,(laughing)
00:41:19,00:41:20,"- Hold on, rivet."
00:41:20,00:41:21,Just googling.
00:41:21,00:41:24,"- 'Cause it holds you together, it holds you in place."
00:41:24,00:41:25,"Yeah, you're right."
00:41:25,00:41:28,"- This is, yeah, they're just, it's a kind of screw."
00:41:28,00:41:30,"- Yeah, yeah, basically, yeah."
00:41:30,00:41:33,- Message in if you didn't know what a rivet was.
00:41:33,00:41:35,"- And if you like, I can repeat that fact for you now."
00:41:35,00:41:38,And it'll be even more exciting this time round.
00:41:38,00:41:40,"- Shouldn't be that, though."
00:41:40,00:41:41,"- Yeah, I'll just quickly mention."
00:41:41,00:41:42,- What?
00:41:42,00:41:43,(laughing)
00:41:43,00:41:44,- I feel like we've got it now.
00:41:44,00:41:46,I've read a tenth of my stuff out.
00:41:46,00:41:48,I haven't told you about the Super Marine Walrus.
00:41:48,00:41:50,- So it's just not of interest.
00:41:50,00:41:52,"Like, what are your subjects that they won't let you"
00:41:52,00:41:52,normally talk about?
00:41:52,00:41:55,"I just need to know, like, how valid."
00:41:55,00:41:57,- It's mostly second-world war logistic.
00:41:57,00:41:59,"- Yeah, we end up letting him do it"
00:41:59,00:42:02,because he does crowbar it in somehow into any old fact.
00:42:02,00:42:03,- So it is a question for you.
00:42:03,00:42:07,Do you follow current war strategy and logistics?
00:42:07,00:42:09,"Like, I've got a whole bunch of male friends"
00:42:09,00:42:12,who are so into the logistics of the Ukrainian war
00:42:12,00:42:15,that it's gone beyond anything that I think is normal.
00:42:15,00:42:18,- You'd have to ask my wife what's normal
00:42:18,00:42:21,in terms of what--
00:42:21,00:42:23,- It's past and present.
00:42:23,00:42:25,- I think logistics is interesting.
00:42:25,00:42:27,(laughing)
00:42:27,00:42:32,"And I'm not, I'm blushing now, but actually,"
00:42:32,00:42:32,I'm not ashamed.
00:42:32,00:42:35,"- Logistics is interesting, needs to go on your tombstone."
00:42:35,00:42:38,"- We can't all be, we can't all be bloody explorers, you know,"
00:42:38,00:42:40,on cool cement ships.
00:42:40,00:42:41,I'm gonna stay on the cement ship.
00:42:41,00:42:43,"Thank you, I don't wanna see Sokotra."
00:42:43,00:42:45,- Look at the rivets on Andy's tombstone.
00:42:45,00:42:47,(laughing)
00:42:47,00:42:48,"- Oh, dear."
00:42:48,00:42:52,- We've been so mean.
00:42:52,00:42:53,"- No, no."
00:42:53,00:42:54,"- Look, some people need to be in logistics."
00:42:54,00:42:55,Just--
00:42:55,00:42:56,"- Well, actually, James is right."
00:42:56,00:42:58,"We're not actually out of time, but we should move on."
00:42:58,00:43:00,"- Oh, can I tell you, can I tell you one more?"
00:43:00,00:43:02,"Like, sort of, Spitfire here,"
00:43:02,00:43:04,he actually wrote a book partly about the Spitfire.
00:43:04,00:43:05,Douglas Bader?
00:43:05,00:43:06,- Yeah.
00:43:06,00:43:06,"- Yeah, yeah."
00:43:06,00:43:08,"- He was a really famous pilot,"
00:43:08,00:43:09,"partly because I think it was in,"
00:43:09,00:43:10,I don't know if it was an accident.
00:43:10,00:43:11,- But he famously had no legs.
00:43:11,00:43:12,- He had no legs.
00:43:12,00:43:13,But he nonetheless--
00:43:13,00:43:15,- He almost lost his legs during mission flight.
00:43:15,00:43:18,"- Yeah, flying accident, yeah, yeah, flying incidents."
00:43:18,00:43:20,And he became a Spitfire ace nonetheless.
00:43:20,00:43:22,"In the Second World War, he was shot down over France,"
00:43:22,00:43:24,"and he ejected, so he survived,"
00:43:24,00:43:26,but he lost one of his prosthetic legs
00:43:26,00:43:28,in the course of being shot down.
00:43:28,00:43:30,"Well, no, he was treated with a lot of respect"
00:43:30,00:43:32,"by the Germans who captured him,"
00:43:32,00:43:34,because there were rules about that.
00:43:34,00:43:35,And he was in a prisoner of war camp.
00:43:35,00:43:38,"And Göring, who was the head of the Luftwaffe,"
00:43:38,00:43:41,"gave special permission for an artificial leg,"
00:43:41,00:43:45,a spare leg to be parachuted into his prisoner of war camp.
00:43:45,00:43:45,- Amazing.
00:43:45,00:43:46,- Yeah.
00:43:46,00:43:47,"- I think what happened was, though,"
00:43:47,00:43:49,"he kept trying to escape,"
00:43:49,00:43:51,and so they confiscated his prosthetic in the end.
00:43:51,00:43:53,"- Yes, they did, yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:43:53,00:43:55,"That was before the relationship started, I guess."
00:43:55,00:43:56,"Yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:43:56,00:43:57,And that was called Operation Leg.
00:43:57,00:43:58,- Nice.
00:43:58,00:44:00,- Where do they come up with their legs?
00:44:00,00:44:02,(all laughing)
00:44:02,00:44:04,"- There's one other hero we should mention,"
00:44:04,00:44:06,which is Lady Houston.
00:44:06,00:44:07,Lady Houston's sort of the reason
00:44:07,00:44:11,that the Spitfire became the Spitfire during the war.
00:44:11,00:44:14,"She was a suffrager, political activist."
00:44:14,00:44:17,"She also was one of the richest women in the UK,"
00:44:17,00:44:18,if not the richest at one point.
00:44:18,00:44:22,And she was someone who kept helping out with war efforts.
00:44:22,00:44:23,She was always donating things.
00:44:23,00:44:26,"- I think the war people didn't like her very much, right?"
00:44:26,00:44:27,- That's right.
00:44:27,00:44:30,- Because she kept saying that they weren't giving
00:44:30,00:44:32,enough money to the war effort.
00:44:32,00:44:33,"They weren't giving enough equipment,"
00:44:33,00:44:34,all that kind of stuff.
00:44:34,00:44:36,"And she would go around with placards saying,"
00:44:36,00:44:38,"""Give them more guns,"" kind of thing."
00:44:38,00:44:39,And they got really annoyed.
00:44:39,00:44:42,But she did get a lot of money together.
00:44:42,00:44:44,"And I think, are you gonna say that she helped"
00:44:44,00:44:46,to pay for the design of the Spitfire?
00:44:46,00:44:47,"- Yeah, basically what it was,"
00:44:47,00:44:49,"was there was a thing called the Snyder Trophy,"
00:44:49,00:44:52,which was a biannual international airspeed race.
00:44:52,00:44:54,And Britain won it twice.
00:44:54,00:44:56,"And the idea was if they won the third one,"
00:44:56,00:44:57,they would get to keep the trophy for good.
00:44:57,00:44:59,"But at this point, the government said,"
00:44:59,00:45:00,"""We're not gonna fund this stuff."
00:45:00,00:45:01,"""We need all the money."""
00:45:01,00:45:03,And she thought that was a huge mistake.
00:45:03,00:45:04,"- It was seen as a bit of a like,"
00:45:04,00:45:06,"""This is a crazy wonder weapon idea."
00:45:06,00:45:09,"""It's not gonna, like this is a mad waste of money."""
00:45:09,00:45:10,- It was in a depression.
00:45:10,00:45:11,"It was, yeah."
00:45:11,00:45:13,"- This was in like late 20s, early 30s."
00:45:13,00:45:14,This was before.
00:45:14,00:45:15,- Exactly.
00:45:15,00:45:18,"And so she said, ""Well, no, that shouldn't be the case."""
00:45:18,00:45:19,So she funded it.
00:45:19,00:45:21,She funded it for it to go ahead.
00:45:21,00:45:23,"And as a result, Rolls-Royce developed a new engine"
00:45:23,00:45:25,that became Spitfire's engine and so on.
00:45:25,00:45:28,So it was down to her and making that happen.
00:45:28,00:45:31,She was the wizened old Texan of her day.
00:45:31,00:45:33,"- Yeah, she was."
00:45:33,00:45:33,- Exactly.
00:45:33,00:45:36,- They're wonderful.
00:45:36,00:45:37,"Let me tell you, if you've got some money,"
00:45:37,00:45:38,lose some of it with me.
00:45:38,00:45:39,It's fine.
00:45:39,00:45:42,- We also have a Patreon just to say.
00:45:42,00:45:44,- Dammit.
00:45:44,00:45:53,"- Okay, it's time for our final fact of the show."
00:45:53,00:45:54,And that is my fact.
00:45:54,00:45:57,My fact this week is that one of the original names proposed
00:45:57,00:46:01,for what we now know as Neanderthals was Homo Stupidus.
00:46:01,00:46:05,- Brilliant.
00:46:05,00:46:07,"- Yeah, so this was in the early days"
00:46:07,00:46:10,"when we were finding skulls of what was then thought like,"
00:46:10,00:46:11,is this a bear?
00:46:11,00:46:14,"Is this a sort of just like, no one knew what it's a plane."
00:46:14,00:46:18,There was a point where we were finding lots of skulls
00:46:18,00:46:20,and we didn't quite know what this thing was.
00:46:20,00:46:22,It would later turn out to be Neanderthals.
00:46:22,00:46:25,"And when they got to a point where they were thinking,"
00:46:25,00:46:27,"""Okay, actually we do have a new different species"
00:46:27,00:46:29,"of Homo here, we need to give it a name."""
00:46:29,00:46:31,But by the look of it and by the skeletons that have been
00:46:31,00:46:35,"found, it looked like a very clumsy, bulky idiot."
00:46:35,00:46:39,"And so a very famous scientist at the time, Ernest Haeckel,"
00:46:39,00:46:42,"suggested, why not call it Homo Stupidus,"
00:46:42,00:46:46,to really dig home that this is why this moron
00:46:46,00:46:48,is no longer existing on our planet.
00:46:48,00:46:50,"Now we now know that this is completely wrong,"
00:46:50,00:46:53,that Neanderthals were actually very intelligent.
00:46:53,00:46:56,"They did art, they could sing, perhaps."
00:46:56,00:46:57,There's lots of things that we're discovering
00:46:57,00:46:58,more and more about them.
00:46:58,00:47:02,"They used penicillin even, like a whole version of penicillin."
00:47:02,00:47:03,"- I mean, prehistoric version."
00:47:03,00:47:04,"- Prehistoric, yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:47:04,00:47:05,- Not over the counter stuff.
00:47:05,00:47:06,- Sure.
00:47:06,00:47:07,"- Yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:47:07,00:47:09,"But you're a Neanderthal expert, Ella."
00:47:09,00:47:11,- So I have a number of questions.
00:47:11,00:47:12,One is...
00:47:12,00:47:13,- I feel we're doing this the wrong way around.
00:47:13,00:47:15,(all laughing)
00:47:15,00:47:17,"- No, this is definitely targeted at you three."
00:47:17,00:47:19,"So when you have the guest on,"
00:47:19,00:47:21,are the topics always consistently the topics
00:47:21,00:47:22,that they are specialists in?
00:47:22,00:47:24,"And if so, why did I get a spitfire?"
00:47:24,00:47:26,(all laughing)
00:47:26,00:47:28,"- I think we try, we try a bit of inside baseball."
00:47:28,00:47:31,We try to do things that our guests
00:47:31,00:47:32,are going to know a lot about.
00:47:32,00:47:33,"- Yeah, on your Wikipedia page,"
00:47:33,00:47:35,it says you're an expert in rivets.
00:47:35,00:47:36,(all laughing)
00:47:36,00:47:38,- Please nobody edit it.
00:47:38,00:47:41,There's already a whole bunch of untruths on that page.
00:47:41,00:47:44,- But sometimes a little fact about maybe logistics
00:47:44,00:47:46,or military strategy will just slip through that.
00:47:46,00:47:48,- I wish this was being filmed 'cause you're Facebook.
00:47:48,00:47:51,(all laughing)
00:47:51,00:47:54,"- Yeah, no, the thing with..."
00:47:54,00:47:59,So taxonomy is the system of naming things in biology.
00:47:59,00:48:02,"And there's this rule called, it's an a priori thing."
00:48:02,00:48:07,And what it means is that if we find a fossil today
00:48:07,00:48:10,"and we call it something,"
00:48:10,00:48:13,that is the name it is given if it becomes a species.
00:48:13,00:48:15,"So if I find a fossil today and I go,"
00:48:15,00:48:17,"oh, it might be homo sapien,"
00:48:17,00:48:20,or it might be homo shriver.
00:48:20,00:48:23,"- Okay, we already had a hop of stupidness."
00:48:23,00:48:25,(all laughing)
00:48:25,00:48:28,"- Then let's say there's this, but I publish it."
00:48:28,00:48:31,"So if I publish it in any journal,"
00:48:31,00:48:34,"then later on, if people are still like,"
00:48:34,00:48:36,"no, no, no, we don't think that's a separate species."
00:48:36,00:48:39,If suddenly two more of them are found
00:48:39,00:48:41,that really do look similar.
00:48:41,00:48:42,"And somebody goes, no, actually,"
00:48:42,00:48:46,we really do think that now needs to be a species.
00:48:46,00:48:50,"They can't go, well, we want to call it homo, whatever."
00:48:50,00:48:52,"No, no, the a priori rule is very clear."
00:48:52,00:48:54,It has to be called that.
00:48:54,00:48:57,"So luckily, homo neanderthalensis must have got in there earlier"
00:48:57,00:49:00,'cause otherwise we would be stuck with that bloody name.
00:49:00,00:49:01,"- Yeah, it was proposed."
00:49:01,00:49:03,It was never seriously taken to a board.
00:49:03,00:49:04,"It was a guy called Dr. William King,"
00:49:04,00:49:08,who was an Irish geologist who eventually was the one
00:49:08,00:49:09,"who said, let's call it neanderthal"
00:49:09,00:49:12,"because it was found, the particular one they were looking at,"
00:49:12,00:49:15,found in 1856 at the Neander River Valley.
00:49:15,00:49:17,So it was named after the area.
00:49:17,00:49:19,"- And Thal is a valley, isn't it?"
00:49:19,00:49:20,I don't know that.
00:49:20,00:49:21,"- Oh, I don't know that."
00:49:21,00:49:23,- It was in the Neander Valley.
00:49:23,00:49:24,It was in the Neander Valley.
00:49:24,00:49:25,"- Wow. - Yeah, that's all."
00:49:25,00:49:30,- So the homo neanderthalensis is what we call it now.
00:49:30,00:49:33,But some people call it homo sapiens neanderthalensis
00:49:33,00:49:36,because it might be a subspecies of homo sapien.
00:49:36,00:49:39,"If it was called homo sapien stupidas,"
00:49:39,00:49:42,then that would literally be stupid wise man.
00:49:42,00:49:43,- Oh yeah.
00:49:43,00:49:46,- Because sapiens means wise and that would have been quieter.
00:49:46,00:49:49,"- Yeah, I don't actually know how sapiens was picked"
00:49:49,00:49:50,'cause it does feel like we've given ourselves
00:49:50,00:49:53,"the nice end of the violence, you know."
00:49:53,00:49:55,"- Yeah, we're great, but I'm just saying it's a bit--"
00:49:55,00:49:59,"- With the naming committee, of course we're gonna."
00:49:59,00:50:02,- Some people said once that the brain is the only thing
00:50:02,00:50:05,"that named itself, which I think is nice."
00:50:05,00:50:07,So brain must be a really good word for it.
00:50:07,00:50:10,"- Yeah, it's actually a rubbish word, isn't it?"
00:50:10,00:50:11,"- Yeah, I think your brain would have come up"
00:50:11,00:50:12,with something better than that.
00:50:12,00:50:14,- Yeah. - Idiot.
00:50:14,00:50:15,- One of the names that the neanderthal could have had
00:50:15,00:50:18,"was Gibraltar man, homo gibraltaris or whatever,"
00:50:18,00:50:20,"because the first, I think the first skulls"
00:50:20,00:50:23,"were found in Gibraltar, but they were found too early."
00:50:23,00:50:25,And they were found by I think a soldier
00:50:25,00:50:28,"and he was a soldier and geologist and he said,"
00:50:28,00:50:29,"I think this might be something new,"
00:50:29,00:50:32,"but he didn't really get anywhere, you know."
00:50:32,00:50:32,"- Yeah, I think there was a few"
00:50:32,00:50:34,"that were found technically before,"
00:50:34,00:50:35,but they just didn't identify that.
00:50:35,00:50:37,"I think there was one in, I think the spi one as well,"
00:50:37,00:50:40,"which is Belgium, I think that's also an early one,"
00:50:40,00:50:42,where they just didn't--
00:50:42,00:50:44,"- Oh, Flint, sorry, Flint was his name, Edmund Flint,"
00:50:44,00:50:46,"which is a nice sort of prehistoric sounding name,"
00:50:46,00:50:46,"or you know, like that."
00:50:46,00:50:48,- He sounds like he's from Flintstones.
00:50:48,00:50:50,"- Yeah, he does, and he found it,"
00:50:50,00:50:51,"but again, he didn't get anywhere."
00:50:51,00:50:53,"And actually, I think the last neanderthals"
00:50:53,00:50:54,also lived in Gibraltar.
00:50:54,00:50:56,"- Well, that's, I disagree with that."
00:50:56,00:50:58,"- Ooh, go on."
00:50:58,00:51:00,"- No, I think the team out there really believed that,"
00:51:00,00:51:03,but I don't think most of the rest of us believe that.
00:51:03,00:51:04,I think we think it's a tosser.
00:51:04,00:51:07,"They might have been the Iberian Peninsula, but I just, yeah."
00:51:07,00:51:08,"- Was it somewhere islandy,"
00:51:08,00:51:10,where things kind of cling on a bit?
00:51:10,00:51:11,"- It was probably just the south,"
00:51:11,00:51:13,"but also we just don't know, actually."
00:51:13,00:51:15,The dates are consciously shifting.
00:51:15,00:51:16,"When I say that, I mean that"
00:51:16,00:51:19,"when the scientists are dating them,"
00:51:19,00:51:21,they're realizing that all the dates we thought we had
00:51:21,00:51:24,"are kind of not as great, shall we say?"
00:51:24,00:51:26,There's many question marks about these dates.
00:51:26,00:51:29,- I was reading about a neanderthal site in Croatia
00:51:29,00:51:31,called Krapina Cave.
00:51:31,00:51:31,- Yeah.
00:51:31,00:51:35,- And what I found is that they found copper lights in there.
00:51:35,00:51:37,So that suggests that the neanderthals
00:51:37,00:51:39,might have actually crept in a cave.
00:51:39,00:51:40,- Do you know what?
00:51:40,00:51:41,- Do you know what?
00:51:41,00:51:44,"It would take you lot for me to realize that Krapina,"
00:51:44,00:51:46,"which is an integral part of my research,"
00:51:46,00:51:47,(laughing)
00:51:47,00:51:49,is actually crabby.
00:51:49,00:51:50,(laughing)
00:51:50,00:51:53,I had never in all my years realized that before.
00:51:53,00:51:54,- That's so good.
00:51:54,00:51:55,- Thank you.
00:51:55,00:51:56,- You're very welcome.
00:51:56,00:51:57,- Don't really appreciate it.
00:51:57,00:51:57,"No, I'm not gonna high five you."
00:51:57,00:52:00,- Sometimes it takes a fool to teach a wise woman.
00:52:00,00:52:01,- That's stupid.
00:52:01,00:52:04,(laughing)
00:52:04,00:52:06,"- Ella, do you know whether or not"
00:52:06,00:52:08,you're a bit neanderthal?
00:52:08,00:52:10,"- Yeah, yeah, I got tested."
00:52:10,00:52:11,- Yeah.
00:52:11,00:52:11,"- What's your, what's your number?"
00:52:11,00:52:12,- I don't know.
00:52:12,00:52:13,I can't remember.
00:52:13,00:52:14,- You can't remember?
00:52:14,00:52:15,- I can't remember.
00:52:15,00:52:16,- You study neanderthals and you can even be--
00:52:16,00:52:16,- I can't remember.
00:52:16,00:52:17,Retaining it.
00:52:17,00:52:20,It was average-ish as far as I can remember.
00:52:20,00:52:21,- Is that what I want?
00:52:21,00:52:21,"- 2% is average, yeah."
00:52:21,00:52:22,"- 2%, and you can do that."
00:52:22,00:52:24,"So the National Geographic Society,"
00:52:24,00:52:26,they have a geographic project
00:52:26,00:52:28,where you do a swab in your mouth and you send it in
00:52:28,00:52:29,and then they can give you the results
00:52:29,00:52:30,and tell you whether you're not.
00:52:30,00:52:32,"And then I think we've, you know,"
00:52:32,00:52:35,we know Ozzy Osbourne is a bit neanderthal.
00:52:35,00:52:37,"- I mean, we mostly are."
00:52:37,00:52:39,"- Is it, everyone outside Africa is a couple of percent"
00:52:39,00:52:43,"and that because early humans left Africa,"
00:52:43,00:52:45,"bred with neanderthals,"
00:52:45,00:52:48,"those populations spread to like Europe, Asia."
00:52:48,00:52:51,"But then, so is it called ghost DNA?"
00:52:51,00:52:52,I love this.
00:52:52,00:52:53,"- Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:52:53,00:52:55,- Even people in Africa these days have kind of
00:52:55,00:52:57,a small fraction of a percent of neanderthal DNA.
00:52:57,00:52:59,"- Well, so there's a few things going on there."
00:52:59,00:53:01,"One is that, yes, it's,"
00:53:01,00:53:03,so everybody outside of sub-Saharan Africa.
00:53:03,00:53:05,"So like the Tennesseans have got some,"
00:53:05,00:53:06,"you know, the Egyptians have got some."
00:53:06,00:53:08,"And what it is is neanderthals were more European,"
00:53:08,00:53:10,Asian species and never went into Africa.
00:53:10,00:53:13,"So it was, that's why sub-Saharan don't really have it."
00:53:13,00:53:16,"The ghost DNA, so this is really cool."
00:53:16,00:53:20,So now ancient DNA is so fascinating
00:53:20,00:53:21,that they have been able to identify
00:53:21,00:53:23,that there are other species out there
00:53:23,00:53:25,"called Homo God knows what,"
00:53:25,00:53:28,but they just don't have a single fossil for it.
00:53:28,00:53:30,"They don't know anything about this,"
00:53:30,00:53:34,"but they know based on looking at all of our DNA globally,"
00:53:34,00:53:37,there were other species that we interbred with.
00:53:37,00:53:38,And we just don't know.
00:53:38,00:53:39,So we know that we interbred with neanderthals.
00:53:39,00:53:42,We know that we interbred with a species called Denisiva.
00:53:42,00:53:45,"And then yeah, in the process of doing all this,"
00:53:45,00:53:47,they've also come across a few ghost lineages.
00:53:47,00:53:49,"And they're like, how do you marry it up"
00:53:49,00:53:50,with the fossils that are out there?
00:53:50,00:53:52,"'Cause you're like, I don't know what it looks like."
00:53:52,00:53:55,"- So can we, do we not name it until we find a fossil?"
00:53:55,00:53:57,"- So in genetics, if it's a ghost lineage,"
00:53:57,00:53:59,they tend to like give it like population Y
00:53:59,00:54:01,or population X or that kind of thing.
00:54:01,00:54:03,They don't give it a name because they really don't know.
00:54:03,00:54:07,"- You've got to give it a cooler name than that, you know?"
00:54:07,00:54:08,"- With that, yeah, that's the whole point."
00:54:08,00:54:10,"It's a standby name, isn't it?"
00:54:10,00:54:11,"- Oh yeah, I see."
00:54:11,00:54:13,And then they'll come up with a really cool name first.
00:54:13,00:54:14,"- Yeah, yeah, yeah, you're right."
00:54:14,00:54:16,"- But like imagine if like, so you've got Homo naledi,"
00:54:16,00:54:20,which is a new species that they discovered in South Africa.
00:54:20,00:54:23,"And that might be the ghost lineage,"
00:54:23,00:54:24,but that might be one of them.
00:54:24,00:54:25,"But we just, we don't know."
00:54:25,00:54:27,"'Cause until we've got DNA, we can't compare the two."
00:54:27,00:54:29,- A DNA from a fossil.
00:54:29,00:54:30,"- Yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:54:30,00:54:32,You need the DNA.
00:54:32,00:54:34,You need DNA from the fossils you've got
00:54:34,00:54:36,to be able to compare it to this ghost lineage.
00:54:36,00:54:38,- So it might be from Homo naledi.
00:54:38,00:54:39,"- It might be naledi, it might be naledi."
00:54:39,00:54:41,We just don't know.
00:54:41,00:54:42,It's so cool.
00:54:42,00:54:43,- It's cool.
00:54:43,00:54:44,"- So the guy that found naledi, Lee Berger,"
00:54:44,00:54:45,"is like, I reckon it is."
00:54:45,00:54:47,"But we were like, maybe."
00:54:47,00:54:48,We don't know though.
00:54:48,00:54:49,- Yeah.
00:54:49,00:54:50,"- Sorry, I got very excited."
00:54:50,00:54:51,"- No, it is exciting."
00:54:51,00:54:52,It's incredible.
00:54:52,00:54:54,"- Do you know, is his name Svante Pabo?"
00:54:54,00:54:55,"- Svante Pabo, yeah."
00:54:55,00:54:57,- So he's a Swedish DNA expert.
00:54:57,00:54:59,"And I think, did he start the field of extracting DNA"
00:54:59,00:55:00,from ancient bones?
00:55:00,00:55:01,- He got a Nobel Prize for it.
00:55:01,00:55:02,"- Oh, nice."
00:55:02,00:55:05,"Well, congratulations, Professor Pabo."
00:55:05,00:55:07,- And it was really funny because he won it for medicine.
00:55:07,00:55:10,"And everybody went, we just had COVID."
00:55:10,00:55:11,What?
00:55:11,00:55:12,We just had COVID.
00:55:12,00:55:13,And you've given it to this guy.
00:55:13,00:55:16,He's found a DNA for slow clap.
00:55:16,00:55:19,- He published this study.
00:55:19,00:55:22,"And you know, he'd realized that you could extract DNA"
00:55:22,00:55:22,from old bones.
00:55:22,00:55:23,And that's a huge realization.
00:55:23,00:55:25,He worked out how to do it as well.
00:55:25,00:55:28,"And he got letters, lots of letters from men saying,"
00:55:28,00:55:31,"""I'm Neanderthal actually."""
00:55:31,00:55:33,"And he said, ""Fully or partly, Neanderthal."""
00:55:33,00:55:37,And offering him samples to analyze for his work.
00:55:37,00:55:38,- What kind of samples?
00:55:38,00:55:39,- I think spit samples.
00:55:39,00:55:42,"I think, but there's a really interesting,"
00:55:42,00:55:44,there's definitely a gender divide here
00:55:44,00:55:48,"because 12 women wrote into him to say,"
00:55:48,00:55:50,"""My husband is definitely, he's a Neanderthal."""
00:55:50,00:55:52,You can study him if you like.
00:55:52,00:55:55,Only two men wrote saying the same of their wives.
00:55:55,00:55:57,"And I don't know if any women wrote in saying,"
00:55:57,00:56:00,"""I think I'm pretty sure I'm a Neanderthal."""
00:56:00,00:56:00,So there's an interesting thing
00:56:00,00:56:02,about how we think of Neanderthals today.
00:56:02,00:56:04,"That's what it tells us about, really."
00:56:04,00:56:05,- Fair enough.
00:56:05,00:56:06,"- That's actually so true because,"
00:56:06,00:56:09,"sorry, I pointed at you very aggressively then, but."
00:56:09,00:56:10,- Andy just for the listeners.
00:56:10,00:56:11,- Yes.
00:56:11,00:56:15,So I made a show called Neanderthals for the BBC and PBS.
00:56:15,00:56:17,And.
00:56:17,00:56:19,"- Oh, with Andy Serkis."
00:56:19,00:56:21,- Andy Serkis who is Gollum in Lord of the Rings.
00:56:21,00:56:22,"- Yeah, and a million other things."
00:56:22,00:56:25,Like the guy's got a very impressive resume.
00:56:25,00:56:27,And there was this really big discussion
00:56:27,00:56:29,"because we were like, ""Blatingly, you're gonna make,"
00:56:29,00:56:31,"""the reconstruction is gonna be a male."""
00:56:31,00:56:34,"But actually, why are the reconstructions of cave men"
00:56:34,00:56:36,always men?
00:56:36,00:56:36,"Like, it doesn't make,"
00:56:36,00:56:38,like think about the descent of man image
00:56:38,00:56:40,"where it's like, you know, from ape to human."
00:56:40,00:56:41,It's always just men.
00:56:41,00:56:42,"And it's like, well, they definitely"
00:56:42,00:56:44,"didn't do that on their own, right?"
00:56:44,00:56:46,"So it's like, where are the women in this?"
00:56:46,00:56:47,And we had a really big discussion.
00:56:47,00:56:51,"And in the end, we did make a man and we called it Ned."
00:56:51,00:56:52,But we did make a Nelly.
00:56:52,00:56:55,But the Nelly was not of the same quality.
00:56:55,00:56:58,"The animation wasn't, it wasn't Andy Serkis' work."
00:56:58,00:56:59,Let's just put it like that.
00:56:59,00:57:02,- Was Andy Serkis playing the motion capture Neanderthal?
00:57:02,00:57:03,"- He brought the Neanderthal to life, basically."
00:57:03,00:57:06,- Did he co-host as that?
00:57:06,00:57:08,"- No, no, no, he was, there's this scene where he,"
00:57:08,00:57:09,"actually, I love this scene."
00:57:09,00:57:11,"It kind of gives me goosebumps when I see it,"
00:57:11,00:57:13,where he wakes the Neanderthal up from his slumber.
00:57:13,00:57:16,So it's an Iraqi Neanderthal and he wakes it up from its slumber.
00:57:16,00:57:16,So he's used it.
00:57:16,00:57:19,He's like Andy's freaking Serkis.
00:57:19,00:57:21,- Was he both of the male and the female?
00:57:21,00:57:22,"- No, no, no."
00:57:22,00:57:24,"They literally, then he was forgotten about."
00:57:24,00:57:25,Not in your Nelly.
00:57:25,00:57:27,"- No, no, no, no, no."
00:57:27,00:57:28,- But he was.
00:57:28,00:57:30,- I do wish he co-hosted it as the end of the film.
00:57:30,00:57:31,"- Yeah, that would have been."
00:57:31,00:57:31,- What could she have been?
00:57:31,00:57:32,- Al-Shamahi.
00:57:32,00:57:35,(laughing)
00:57:35,00:57:38,- So do you guys know why Neanderthals
00:57:38,00:57:40,have got such a bad rep?
00:57:40,00:57:42,"- Oh, oh, was it, oh."
00:57:42,00:57:44,"- Did they find what were effectively, unfortunately,"
00:57:44,00:57:47,deformed skeletons and so on?
00:57:47,00:57:48,"And yeah, and so we just thought,"
00:57:48,00:57:51,"ah, that must be what they all looked like."
00:57:51,00:57:55,"- Yeah, so basically it was an individual,"
00:57:55,00:57:58,"L'Achabalocin, don't query my French."
00:57:58,00:58:02,And it was a highly arthritic individual.
00:58:02,00:58:04,"It was an old man, although I'm pretty sure"
00:58:04,00:58:07,"it was only like 40, but, you know, old for the time,"
00:58:07,00:58:09,but very young for today.
00:58:09,00:58:12,(laughing)
00:58:12,00:58:13,"And they basically, he was--"
00:58:13,00:58:14,- I don't like the way you looked at me
00:58:14,00:58:16,"when you said that, I like that."
00:58:16,00:58:17,(laughing)
00:58:17,00:58:19,- He was highly arthritic.
00:58:19,00:58:21,"And there's a number of things going on here,"
00:58:21,00:58:26,but the guy who did the reconstruction of this fossil
00:58:26,00:58:30,"basically portrayed it as being like,"
00:58:30,00:58:31,"essentially knuckle-dragging,"
00:58:31,00:58:34,"well, kind of its heads jutting forward."
00:58:34,00:58:37,"It's, you know, its knees are bent, blah, blah, blah."
00:58:37,00:58:40,And then they obviously realized later on
00:58:40,00:58:41,"that that was completely incorrect,"
00:58:41,00:58:42,but it was too late.
00:58:42,00:58:44,"It was like it got out there that this is,"
00:58:44,00:58:46,and because we were looking for a missing link
00:58:46,00:58:47,"in inverted commas, right?"
00:58:47,00:58:49,So it kind of fit the narrative.
00:58:49,00:58:50,"And it was a new field, right?"
00:58:50,00:58:53,Reconstructing what somebody looked like from a fossil
00:58:53,00:58:55,"was such a new field that, you know,"
00:58:55,00:58:57,"and so essentially, it's everybody's speculating since"
00:58:57,00:58:59,"as to why he did such a bad job,"
00:58:59,00:59:01,which is really embarrassing because he's a legacy
00:59:01,00:59:04,"amongst other things, 'cause he's quite a renowned person,"
00:59:04,00:59:07,is that he basically did an awful PR job on the underfills.
00:59:07,00:59:11,"- Oh, this is amazing, like if just like, for instance,"
00:59:11,00:59:13,"in a million years time, they find humans"
00:59:13,00:59:16,"and they only find my body,"
00:59:16,00:59:18,"I have very bad sinuses, right?"
00:59:18,00:59:21,They're just gonna think all humans had a cold all the time.
00:59:21,00:59:22,- That's it.
00:59:22,00:59:22,"- Yeah, that's it."
00:59:22,00:59:24,"- You know, and that's basically what happened."
00:59:24,00:59:25,- That's completely--
00:59:25,00:59:26,- They're gonna find Dan's body and think
00:59:26,00:59:28,all humans were unbelievably hairy.
00:59:28,00:59:30,"- So they'll think, oh, wait, they--"
00:59:30,00:59:31,- I love how you guys don't know how bodies
00:59:31,00:59:33,"and decomposition work, so we're sure, yeah,"
00:59:33,00:59:35,hair is gonna be found on--
00:59:35,00:59:36,"- They'll find Andy and they'll be like,"
00:59:36,00:59:40,"well, all humans used to make model hair replacements."
00:59:40,00:59:42,- That's 'cause they'll have found me in my tomb
00:59:42,00:59:44,where I've been buried with all my air fixes.
00:59:44,00:59:47,"- And all your rivet pivots, rivets, rivets."
00:59:47,00:59:48,"- Oh, my riveting."
00:59:48,00:59:49,(all laughing)
00:59:49,00:59:52,(upbeat music)
00:59:52,00:59:56,"- Okay, that's it, that is all of our facts."
00:59:56,00:59:58,Thank you so much for listening.
