00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,580
 (upbeat music)

2
00:00:02,580 --> 00:00:05,800
 - Hi everyone, welcome to this week's episode

3
00:00:05,800 --> 00:00:07,040
 of "Notice Things of Fish"

4
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:12,040
 where we are joined by the wonderful Ella Al-Shemahi.

5
00:00:12,040 --> 00:00:16,280
 You might remember Ella from episode 373

6
00:00:16,280 --> 00:00:19,800
 of "Notice Things of Fish" when she last appeared,

7
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:21,040
 but if you don't remember that,

8
00:00:21,040 --> 00:00:24,520
 then she is a paleoanthropologist.

9
00:00:24,520 --> 00:00:26,200
 She's an expert in Neanderthals.

10
00:00:26,200 --> 00:00:29,200
 She is a National Geographic Explorer.

11
00:00:29,200 --> 00:00:32,000
 She's just an all-round badass.

12
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,160
 Ella has written a book called "The Handshake

13
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:36,440
 "A Gripping History,"

14
00:00:36,440 --> 00:00:38,560
 which we talked about last time she was on,

15
00:00:38,560 --> 00:00:40,900
 but she's also been on loads of TV shows,

16
00:00:40,900 --> 00:00:42,360
 loads of documentaries.

17
00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:45,500
 The last one I think was called "Our Changing Planet,"

18
00:00:45,500 --> 00:00:48,320
 all about the world's most threatened ecosystems,

19
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:49,900
 and you can actually still watch that

20
00:00:49,900 --> 00:00:54,140
 if you go to BBC iPlayer or PBS Video app.

21
00:00:54,140 --> 00:00:56,360
 Anyway, really hope you enjoyed this week's show.

22
00:00:56,360 --> 00:00:58,160
 Don't forget, "Club Fish" exists,

23
00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:00,720
 a place where you can get loads of extra content

24
00:01:00,720 --> 00:01:02,480
 and ad-free episodes.

25
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:05,480
 Don't forget, there are still one or two tickets,

26
00:01:05,480 --> 00:01:08,780
 I think, possibly left for our live shows

27
00:01:08,780 --> 00:01:10,720
 coming up in the Soho Theatre in London,

28
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:12,040
 and you can get those by going to

29
00:01:12,040 --> 00:01:15,240
 noticethingsofish.com/soho.

30
00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:16,640
 Anyway, that's enough of that.

31
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:18,800
 Really hope you enjoy this week's show with Ella,

32
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:21,000
 and it's on with the podcast.

33
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,580
 (upbeat music)

34
00:01:24,260 --> 00:01:28,420
 (speaking in foreign language)

35
00:01:28,420 --> 00:01:38,140
 - Hello, and welcome to another episode

36
00:01:38,140 --> 00:01:40,700
 of No Such Thing as a Fish, a weekly podcast

37
00:01:40,700 --> 00:01:43,460
 coming to you from the QI offices in Hoburn.

38
00:01:43,460 --> 00:01:45,500
 My name is Dan Schreiber, I am sitting here

39
00:01:45,500 --> 00:01:47,940
 with Andrew Hunter Murray, James Harkin,

40
00:01:47,940 --> 00:01:50,140
 and Ella Alshamahi, and once again,

41
00:01:50,140 --> 00:01:51,700
 we have gathered around the microphones

42
00:01:51,700 --> 00:01:54,340
 with our four favorite facts from the last seven days,

43
00:01:54,340 --> 00:01:57,060
 and in no particular order, here we go.

44
00:01:57,060 --> 00:02:00,460
 Starting with fact number one, and that is Ella.

45
00:02:00,460 --> 00:02:03,740
 - American beer was so bad in the early 1900s

46
00:02:03,740 --> 00:02:08,740
 that the US government sent Alexander Graham Bell's son-in-law

47
00:02:08,740 --> 00:02:14,140
 on a secret mission to Bavaria to steal German hops.

48
00:02:14,140 --> 00:02:16,780
 - Wow, God, so much to unpack.

49
00:02:16,780 --> 00:02:20,340
 - Yeah, okay, so Alexander Graham Bell's son-in-law,

50
00:02:20,340 --> 00:02:21,540
 was that an important part of,

51
00:02:21,540 --> 00:02:22,660
 was that what the American government

52
00:02:22,660 --> 00:02:23,860
 were looking for, was that the brief?

53
00:02:23,860 --> 00:02:26,180
 - The really sad thing is, David Fairchild

54
00:02:26,180 --> 00:02:28,460
 is like a hugely celebrated botanist,

55
00:02:28,460 --> 00:02:30,540
 and is described as the food explorer,

56
00:02:30,540 --> 00:02:31,700
 and yet for our purposes,

57
00:02:31,700 --> 00:02:34,140
 he's just Alexander Graham Bell's son-in-law.

58
00:02:34,140 --> 00:02:36,620
 'Cause to be fair, if he was your father-in-law,

59
00:02:36,620 --> 00:02:38,540
 that's the end of your identity, right?

60
00:02:38,540 --> 00:02:39,860
 - But was it, maybe this was at the point

61
00:02:39,860 --> 00:02:42,060
 when there was only two telephones in the country,

62
00:02:42,060 --> 00:02:43,780
 and so the government would just call him up

63
00:02:43,780 --> 00:02:46,040
 and say, "You got anyone we could use?"

64
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:46,880
 - Yeah.

65
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:49,100
 - So you think when he invented two telephones,

66
00:02:49,100 --> 00:02:51,140
 Alexander Graham Bell, he gave one to the government,

67
00:02:51,140 --> 00:02:54,380
 and kept one himself, and no one else needs one, it's fine.

68
00:02:54,380 --> 00:02:55,660
 - And it became like the bat phone,

69
00:02:55,660 --> 00:02:57,460
 was any time they were needed for anything.

70
00:02:57,460 --> 00:02:58,300
 - The bell phone.

71
00:02:58,300 --> 00:02:59,140
 - Yeah, the bell phone.

72
00:02:59,140 --> 00:03:01,300
 - I'm loving the facts today, guys.

73
00:03:01,300 --> 00:03:03,340
 - So yeah, what's this guy, Fairchild?

74
00:03:03,340 --> 00:03:04,660
 - So, all right, so David Fairchild,

75
00:03:04,660 --> 00:03:08,420
 so he's a food explorer, and I think he's absolutely

76
00:03:08,420 --> 00:03:11,100
 fascinating, 'cause explorers usually go around the planet,

77
00:03:11,100 --> 00:03:12,380
 let's be honest, discovering stuff,

78
00:03:12,380 --> 00:03:14,500
 but also pillaging a lot, and what have you,

79
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:17,540
 and like stealing artifacts, and whatever takes your fancy.

80
00:03:17,540 --> 00:03:21,100
 But this guy did it with plants, with botany,

81
00:03:21,100 --> 00:03:23,620
 which is, in my mind, is just like the loveliest thing

82
00:03:23,620 --> 00:03:25,380
 to go around the planet stealing.

83
00:03:25,380 --> 00:03:27,260
 (laughing)

84
00:03:27,260 --> 00:03:29,220
 'Cause all he's doing is, he's basically turned around

85
00:03:29,220 --> 00:03:31,300
 at the beginning of the 1900s going,

86
00:03:31,300 --> 00:03:33,460
 and the end of the 1800s going,

87
00:03:33,460 --> 00:03:36,020
 America is a country clearly on the rise,

88
00:03:36,020 --> 00:03:39,660
 but our agriculture's bad, our food is bad,

89
00:03:39,660 --> 00:03:44,540
 but our industries as related to plants are just bad,

90
00:03:44,540 --> 00:03:47,260
 so I'm gonna go off to 50-odd countries,

91
00:03:47,260 --> 00:03:51,220
 and just collect samples, send seeds back,

92
00:03:51,220 --> 00:03:53,100
 send saplings back, that kind of thing.

93
00:03:53,100 --> 00:03:55,780
 And because it's plants, I just can't get mad at him,

94
00:03:55,780 --> 00:03:57,580
 because I'm just like, you were just helping

95
00:03:57,580 --> 00:03:59,540
 to feed your people, and build industry.

96
00:03:59,540 --> 00:04:01,700
 - Could we get him canceled because he was like,

97
00:04:01,700 --> 00:04:03,660
 stealing from the farms in other countries?

98
00:04:03,660 --> 00:04:04,900
 - Are you trying to get him canceled?

99
00:04:04,900 --> 00:04:06,340
 - I'm doing my best.

100
00:04:06,340 --> 00:04:08,500
 I do this on this podcast, you know, and we have that.

101
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:10,460
 - Don't ever mention anyone you like on this show.

102
00:04:10,460 --> 00:04:12,620
 James will find a way to destroy it.

103
00:04:12,620 --> 00:04:14,700
 - Do not do this to me, 'cause I actually,

104
00:04:14,700 --> 00:04:17,540
 I've decided that he's like the one explorer

105
00:04:17,540 --> 00:04:19,300
 that I really have nothing bad to say about.

106
00:04:19,300 --> 00:04:20,980
 I'm like, I'm not fair enough,

107
00:04:20,980 --> 00:04:22,300
 you're trying to feed your people.

108
00:04:22,300 --> 00:04:24,900
 He did give the Americans broccoli and kale, so.

109
00:04:24,900 --> 00:04:26,860
 - Oh yeah, yeah, I love those two things.

110
00:04:26,860 --> 00:04:30,060
 - It's interesting how limited American food was.

111
00:04:30,060 --> 00:04:33,620
 I didn't really appreciate that before the 1890s,

112
00:04:33,620 --> 00:04:34,580
 when he really got crack.

113
00:04:34,580 --> 00:04:36,180
 They had occasional introductions,

114
00:04:36,180 --> 00:04:39,260
 like in the World's Fair in 1876,

115
00:04:39,260 --> 00:04:41,500
 which was effectively America's 100th birthday,

116
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:43,820
 they got the banana, that was good.

117
00:04:43,820 --> 00:04:44,660
 That was a big advance.

118
00:04:44,660 --> 00:04:47,300
 - Also, can we just take a second to talk about world fairs?

119
00:04:47,300 --> 00:04:48,860
 Aren't they just the best thing ever?

120
00:04:48,860 --> 00:04:49,860
 - Yeah.

121
00:04:49,860 --> 00:04:51,060
 - Just this world where you were like,

122
00:04:51,060 --> 00:04:53,540
 oh, let's just do a World Fair.

123
00:04:53,540 --> 00:04:55,260
 And it actually was like everyone was like,

124
00:04:55,260 --> 00:04:56,540
 oh crap, that's actually, that's new.

125
00:04:56,540 --> 00:04:57,380
 That's, what is that?

126
00:04:57,380 --> 00:04:58,220
 It's yellow and it's bendy.

127
00:04:58,220 --> 00:04:59,060
 That's amazing.

128
00:04:59,060 --> 00:04:59,940
 - When did we last have one?

129
00:04:59,940 --> 00:05:00,780
 It's been a long time.

130
00:05:00,780 --> 00:05:02,980
 - Well, I went to one in Dubai this year.

131
00:05:02,980 --> 00:05:04,820
 - Oh yes, okay, so this year.

132
00:05:04,820 --> 00:05:06,340
 - Oh yeah, they did that, hold on.

133
00:05:06,340 --> 00:05:08,180
 - Well, they did one during COVID,

134
00:05:08,180 --> 00:05:10,220
 and obviously no one could go.

135
00:05:10,220 --> 00:05:13,380
 And then when I went, everything was closed.

136
00:05:13,380 --> 00:05:15,780
 So you couldn't even get an Uber, everyone had gone home.

137
00:05:15,780 --> 00:05:16,620
 - Oh, right.

138
00:05:16,620 --> 00:05:17,460
 - 'Cause that's what it is.

139
00:05:17,460 --> 00:05:20,300
 They build them these sort of huge things, don't they?

140
00:05:20,300 --> 00:05:22,700
 And all the different countries have their different stalls

141
00:05:22,700 --> 00:05:24,540
 where they're saying, in Uzbekistan,

142
00:05:24,540 --> 00:05:26,620
 we make amazing bananas or whatever.

143
00:05:26,620 --> 00:05:29,180
 And then two years later, they all go home and that's it.

144
00:05:29,180 --> 00:05:31,940
 - They only do with countries that are on the rise, right?

145
00:05:31,940 --> 00:05:32,780
 - Yeah.

146
00:05:32,780 --> 00:05:34,580
 - Like, we wouldn't do a world,

147
00:05:34,580 --> 00:05:36,060
 America wouldn't do a World Fair anymore.

148
00:05:36,060 --> 00:05:38,300
 We are the world, why would we do a World Fair?

149
00:05:38,300 --> 00:05:39,260
 - There was the big one in America.

150
00:05:39,260 --> 00:05:40,660
 Carl Sagan went to as a kid.

151
00:05:40,660 --> 00:05:43,140
 So Sagan would be in his 80s if he was still alive

152
00:05:43,140 --> 00:05:45,380
 in the 1990s, so, you know, within that world.

153
00:05:45,380 --> 00:05:48,060
 - The one in Dubai, just to say this is quite interesting

154
00:05:48,060 --> 00:05:51,460
 'cause each country made their own sort of building

155
00:05:51,460 --> 00:05:52,900
 and they were all kind of shaped

156
00:05:52,900 --> 00:05:56,620
 with Uzbekistani design or Azerbaijani design or whatever.

157
00:05:56,620 --> 00:05:57,780
 And now they're changing it

158
00:05:57,780 --> 00:06:00,300
 and they're turning it into flats the whole place.

159
00:06:00,300 --> 00:06:01,140
 - Oh wow.

160
00:06:01,140 --> 00:06:03,140
 - And they're gonna make it so you can live in this area.

161
00:06:03,140 --> 00:06:04,660
 But it means that all these buildings

162
00:06:04,660 --> 00:06:06,620
 are just these incredible designs

163
00:06:06,620 --> 00:06:08,620
 that have made from the best architects in the world.

164
00:06:08,620 --> 00:06:09,940
 - It sounds like you're selling Dubai

165
00:06:09,940 --> 00:06:10,980
 instead of cancelling Dubai,

166
00:06:10,980 --> 00:06:14,620
 which I thought you were the cancelling Dubai.

167
00:06:14,620 --> 00:06:15,460
 - Is it Dubai?

168
00:06:15,460 --> 00:06:16,820
 - There's no, you can't get an Uber there.

169
00:06:16,820 --> 00:06:18,420
 You can't, there's no shops there already for you.

170
00:06:18,420 --> 00:06:19,260
 So I'm gonna live here.

171
00:06:19,260 --> 00:06:22,500
 - Oh, that's the bad side of Dubai, guys.

172
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:24,140
 I'm all the bad crap.

173
00:06:24,140 --> 00:06:26,260
 - Famously, there are no shops in Dubai.

174
00:06:26,260 --> 00:06:30,620
 Someone emailed in and I've got a bunch of their fact now

175
00:06:30,620 --> 00:06:32,100
 and also not credit them

176
00:06:32,100 --> 00:06:32,940
 'cause I don't think we're gonna end up

177
00:06:32,940 --> 00:06:34,220
 talking about World Fairs.

178
00:06:34,220 --> 00:06:37,300
 It was a few years ago, the Brazilian delegation

179
00:06:37,300 --> 00:06:40,820
 turned their entire thing into a trampoline.

180
00:06:40,820 --> 00:06:41,660
 - What?

181
00:06:41,660 --> 00:06:43,420
 - It was something like a 4,000 square foot trampoline,

182
00:06:43,420 --> 00:06:45,900
 the Brazilian bit of the world.

183
00:06:45,900 --> 00:06:47,060
 - Was it to sell rubber?

184
00:06:47,060 --> 00:06:48,340
 - I don't think it was.

185
00:06:48,340 --> 00:06:49,580
 I don't even think it was.

186
00:06:49,580 --> 00:06:50,700
 I think it was just saying,

187
00:06:50,700 --> 00:06:52,820
 look, everyone else has got good stuff here.

188
00:06:52,820 --> 00:06:54,100
 Well, you've got a big old trampoline.

189
00:06:54,100 --> 00:06:56,620
 So just come along, have a bounce, enjoy yourself.

190
00:06:56,620 --> 00:07:00,140
 - They had a big project that at the last minute

191
00:07:00,140 --> 00:07:00,980
 got taken away.

192
00:07:00,980 --> 00:07:03,300
 They went, what have we got?

193
00:07:03,300 --> 00:07:04,740
 - Why are we talking about the World Fair?

194
00:07:04,740 --> 00:07:05,580
 - I'm sorry, I got distracted.

195
00:07:05,580 --> 00:07:07,340
 - Yeah, this is what happens when Ella is around.

196
00:07:07,340 --> 00:07:08,860
 - Because during the World Fair,

197
00:07:08,860 --> 00:07:10,540
 the banana was introduced to America.

198
00:07:10,540 --> 00:07:11,380
 - Yeah.

199
00:07:11,380 --> 00:07:12,460
 - And it's not food introduction.

200
00:07:12,460 --> 00:07:13,980
 - By Fairchild or someone else.

201
00:07:13,980 --> 00:07:16,340
 - By someone else, that was like a sporadic thing.

202
00:07:16,340 --> 00:07:18,460
 But then when he really got going,

203
00:07:18,460 --> 00:07:19,980
 he was privately funded as well.

204
00:07:19,980 --> 00:07:20,820
 - Yes.

205
00:07:20,820 --> 00:07:22,020
 - By Barbaul Lathrop.

206
00:07:22,020 --> 00:07:22,860
 - Yes, yes, yes.

207
00:07:22,860 --> 00:07:25,860
 A wonderfully gay, fabulous figure, basically,

208
00:07:25,860 --> 00:07:27,780
 who was just this incredible philanthropist.

209
00:07:27,780 --> 00:07:29,620
 - Squillionaire, just looking for something to fund.

210
00:07:29,620 --> 00:07:31,460
 - And they bumped into each other on a boat, didn't they?

211
00:07:31,460 --> 00:07:33,500
 And he just went, I'll fund this trip.

212
00:07:33,500 --> 00:07:35,700
 Are you trying to steal avocados?

213
00:07:35,700 --> 00:07:37,020
 - Yeah, why not?

214
00:07:37,020 --> 00:07:37,860
 This sounds great.

215
00:07:37,860 --> 00:07:41,420
 - Can I just say, as an explorer with National Geographic,

216
00:07:41,420 --> 00:07:43,780
 that is our dream, that we're like, no, no, no.

217
00:07:43,780 --> 00:07:45,940
 If you think I am kidding, you do not know,

218
00:07:45,940 --> 00:07:48,020
 like my friend group, in the sense that we are like,

219
00:07:48,020 --> 00:07:49,660
 we literally just sit there, constantly going,

220
00:07:49,660 --> 00:07:52,140
 all right, how do we get this kind of thing

221
00:07:52,140 --> 00:07:53,180
 from philanthropy?

222
00:07:53,180 --> 00:07:54,900
 And every so often it works out.

223
00:07:54,900 --> 00:07:56,500
 So I've got friends that like,

224
00:07:56,500 --> 00:07:59,420
 they're like this smart friend of the philanthropist,

225
00:07:59,420 --> 00:08:01,500
 who is like some billionaire or millionaire.

226
00:08:01,500 --> 00:08:03,420
 - They're like their sugar mama, dadda, whatever.

227
00:08:03,420 --> 00:08:05,780
 - Have I ever told you the story of Nat Geo?

228
00:08:05,780 --> 00:08:07,060
 Somebody walks up to me.

229
00:08:07,060 --> 00:08:08,660
 It's really old guy, bless him.

230
00:08:08,660 --> 00:08:10,620
 That's the first time I've ever been at National Geographic.

231
00:08:10,620 --> 00:08:13,540
 And he looks at me and goes, I'm from Austin, Texas.

232
00:08:13,540 --> 00:08:14,980
 I'm not an oil man, but I've got money

233
00:08:14,980 --> 00:08:16,320
 and I want to give you some.

234
00:08:16,320 --> 00:08:17,660
 (laughing)

235
00:08:17,660 --> 00:08:19,060
 - What the hell?

236
00:08:19,060 --> 00:08:20,700
 - I saw that money in my account.

237
00:08:20,700 --> 00:08:22,420
 An expedition was part funded by it.

238
00:08:22,420 --> 00:08:24,140
 - Wow, so as simple as that.

239
00:08:24,140 --> 00:08:25,260
 Okay, so it does happen.

240
00:08:25,260 --> 00:08:27,020
 Yeah, that's amazing.

241
00:08:27,020 --> 00:08:28,860
 So Fairchild, I agree.

242
00:08:28,860 --> 00:08:30,540
 I think reading about him,

243
00:08:30,540 --> 00:08:31,860
 he seems like an extraordinary guy.

244
00:08:31,860 --> 00:08:34,540
 I'm surprised I'd never heard of him, for example.

245
00:08:34,540 --> 00:08:36,420
 But if you're in America and you're eating,

246
00:08:36,420 --> 00:08:39,980
 say like peaches or nectarines or avocados or mangoes,

247
00:08:39,980 --> 00:08:42,540
 most likely the one that you're eating right now,

248
00:08:42,540 --> 00:08:44,860
 someone's bound to be eating one right now as they listen,

249
00:08:44,860 --> 00:08:47,280
 shares genes from the ones that Fairchild

250
00:08:47,280 --> 00:08:49,980
 introduced to the country all those years ago.

251
00:08:49,980 --> 00:08:54,380
 What a sort of footprint he's left in the country.

252
00:08:54,380 --> 00:08:55,620
 - It's incredible.

253
00:08:55,620 --> 00:08:57,340
 - Send us your photos.

254
00:08:57,340 --> 00:09:01,340
 If you're eating a mango now in America specifically,

255
00:09:01,340 --> 00:09:03,860
 or an avocado, some quinoa.

256
00:09:03,860 --> 00:09:05,580
 - Yeah, did he bring in quinoa?

257
00:09:05,580 --> 00:09:07,780
 - Yep, podcast at qi.com.

258
00:09:07,780 --> 00:09:09,060
 - Mangosteens?

259
00:09:09,060 --> 00:09:11,420
 - The mangosteen, oh great, let's talk about this.

260
00:09:11,420 --> 00:09:12,300
 This is great.

261
00:09:12,300 --> 00:09:14,300
 - Go on, what about the mangosteen?

262
00:09:14,300 --> 00:09:17,660
 - It's a fruit that he introduced and that never took off.

263
00:09:17,660 --> 00:09:18,980
 'Cause he introduced thousands.

264
00:09:18,980 --> 00:09:19,820
 And they didn't all take off.

265
00:09:19,820 --> 00:09:22,540
 - Yeah, you can still buy mangosteens though, can't you?

266
00:09:22,540 --> 00:09:23,380
 - Think so.

267
00:09:23,380 --> 00:09:24,460
 They just never explained it.

268
00:09:24,460 --> 00:09:26,100
 - I had never heard of the mangosteen before.

269
00:09:26,100 --> 00:09:27,060
 - I had never. - Really?

270
00:09:27,060 --> 00:09:27,900
 - Yeah.

271
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:30,500
 - The guy who wrote the book on David Fairchild

272
00:09:30,500 --> 00:09:32,060
 is Dan Stone, who's a friend of mine.

273
00:09:32,060 --> 00:09:34,180
 And apparently while he was writing this book,

274
00:09:34,180 --> 00:09:36,780
 everybody would just send him really exotic fruit

275
00:09:36,780 --> 00:09:38,460
 like for the whole time he was writing the book.

276
00:09:38,460 --> 00:09:40,380
 'Cause they were like, this is good for you, no?

277
00:09:40,380 --> 00:09:41,860
 - Yeah. - He's not sure.

278
00:09:41,860 --> 00:09:43,540
 - Yeah, the book's called The Food Explorer, by the way.

279
00:09:43,540 --> 00:09:46,060
 I think it's fair to say that every bit of research I have

280
00:09:46,060 --> 00:09:48,540
 is from Dan Stone, so yeah, well done.

281
00:09:48,540 --> 00:09:50,340
 - So Dan, tell us about mangosteen, Sandy.

282
00:09:50,340 --> 00:09:51,940
 - Well, as far as I can tell,

283
00:09:51,940 --> 00:09:53,900
 again, Dan and I have never heard of them before

284
00:09:53,900 --> 00:09:55,780
 and you two are having them for breakfast every day.

285
00:09:55,780 --> 00:09:57,060
 So correct me if I'm wrong.

286
00:09:57,060 --> 00:10:00,860
 But the size of a fist, roughly, and they're like a lychee.

287
00:10:00,860 --> 00:10:01,700
 - Brilliant.

288
00:10:01,700 --> 00:10:03,780
 - But the problem is, they're not great for farming.

289
00:10:03,780 --> 00:10:05,820
 And what he was doing, Fairchild,

290
00:10:05,820 --> 00:10:07,620
 you have to persuade the farmers to grow the things

291
00:10:07,620 --> 00:10:08,940
 and the public to buy them.

292
00:10:08,940 --> 00:10:11,260
 So it's got two jobs to carry out, basically.

293
00:10:11,260 --> 00:10:12,900
 And he couldn't persuade either, apparently,

294
00:10:12,900 --> 00:10:13,980
 either side of the equation.

295
00:10:13,980 --> 00:10:17,340
 'Cause they're really hard, they bruise worse than peaches

296
00:10:17,340 --> 00:10:19,660
 and they're just a nightmare to transport

297
00:10:19,660 --> 00:10:21,580
 and they go off really quickly.

298
00:10:21,580 --> 00:10:23,540
 But he said they were the queen of fruits.

299
00:10:23,540 --> 00:10:24,820
 - They were his favorites. - Oh, really?

300
00:10:24,820 --> 00:10:25,940
 - I know. - And he kept trying

301
00:10:25,940 --> 00:10:28,740
 to make them happen, like fetch in Mean Girls.

302
00:10:28,740 --> 00:10:29,580
 (laughing)

303
00:10:29,580 --> 00:10:30,940
 He kept trying to make it happen

304
00:10:30,940 --> 00:10:33,060
 and no one was picking up on it.

305
00:10:33,060 --> 00:10:35,020
 And so all these things he brought into the country,

306
00:10:35,020 --> 00:10:37,700
 but the one of which you headlined your fact with

307
00:10:37,700 --> 00:10:40,260
 is very interesting because it was the beer hops.

308
00:10:40,260 --> 00:10:41,940
 And you'd think you'd just go into a country,

309
00:10:41,940 --> 00:10:43,540
 grab some fruit and leave the country,

310
00:10:43,540 --> 00:10:45,340
 but no, people were so protective.

311
00:10:45,340 --> 00:10:48,660
 They would have boys sleeping with the hops at night

312
00:10:48,660 --> 00:10:49,500
 to make sure no one would steal.

313
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:51,100
 - Yeah, they would pay to security, that's the thing.

314
00:10:51,100 --> 00:10:53,740
 - So he'd come in and integrate himself with the communities.

315
00:10:53,740 --> 00:10:55,180
 He would sort of become friends.

316
00:10:55,180 --> 00:10:57,060
 - And so this particular hop,

317
00:10:57,060 --> 00:10:58,500
 so this is, I think, the Sems hop,

318
00:10:58,500 --> 00:11:02,300
 he basically started talking about Sems,

319
00:11:02,300 --> 00:11:04,460
 the guy that came up with it, who was dead at this point.

320
00:11:04,460 --> 00:11:08,620
 And he offered the son of Sems, basically he said,

321
00:11:08,620 --> 00:11:10,820
 "Look, I'm really scared that in a few generations,

322
00:11:10,820 --> 00:11:12,940
 "people aren't gonna know about your dad, blah, blah, blah."

323
00:11:12,940 --> 00:11:15,140
 So he was like, "Why don't you build a plaque?

324
00:11:15,140 --> 00:11:16,300
 "I will pay for it."

325
00:11:16,300 --> 00:11:18,820
 So he basically put money down.

326
00:11:18,820 --> 00:11:20,700
 Impressive US diplomacy here.

327
00:11:20,700 --> 00:11:23,180
 And they made such a song and dance about it.

328
00:11:23,180 --> 00:11:24,020
 Everybody was really happy.

329
00:11:24,020 --> 00:11:26,980
 The whole, like, everybody in the town was happy about it.

330
00:11:26,980 --> 00:11:30,220
 And then apparently somebody at night knocks on his door

331
00:11:30,220 --> 00:11:32,500
 when it's raining and goes, "Do you want some?

332
00:11:32,500 --> 00:11:33,900
 "Do you want some cuttings?"

333
00:11:33,900 --> 00:11:35,780
 And apparently he has to really restrain himself

334
00:11:35,780 --> 00:11:37,700
 to not be like, "Yes, this is exactly why I did all this

335
00:11:37,700 --> 00:11:40,220
 "and I've been manipulating you guys for weeks."

336
00:11:40,220 --> 00:11:41,540
 And he was like, "Yeah, okay."

337
00:11:41,540 --> 00:11:43,860
 And he goes, "Okay, I can't do this publicly.

338
00:11:43,860 --> 00:11:46,220
 "I have to do it quietly, but I'll send 100 cuttings

339
00:11:46,220 --> 00:11:48,260
 "to the next station down the line."

340
00:11:48,260 --> 00:11:49,700
 - Oh, not even handing them over now.

341
00:11:49,700 --> 00:11:50,940
 - No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

342
00:11:50,940 --> 00:11:52,380
 It was proper espionage.

343
00:11:52,380 --> 00:11:53,220
 - That's amazing.

344
00:11:53,220 --> 00:11:57,780
 - It's hilarious, but also to think of all the espionage

345
00:11:57,780 --> 00:11:59,140
 that the US government has ever done.

346
00:11:59,140 --> 00:12:01,100
 - I just can't object to this one.

347
00:12:01,100 --> 00:12:05,340
 - Yeah, that's why American beer now is so delicious.

348
00:12:05,340 --> 00:12:06,860
 (laughing)

349
00:12:06,860 --> 00:12:08,660
 I mean, how bad must it have been?

350
00:12:08,660 --> 00:12:10,460
 - So, here's the crazy thing.

351
00:12:10,460 --> 00:12:11,860
 Apparently during Prohibition,

352
00:12:11,860 --> 00:12:15,580
 all his hops were uprooted.

353
00:12:15,580 --> 00:12:17,420
 So all the same hops that Fertile Halled.

354
00:12:17,420 --> 00:12:18,260
 - Oh, really?

355
00:12:18,260 --> 00:12:19,340
 - Yeah, they were all uprooted during the--

356
00:12:19,340 --> 00:12:20,180
 - I read that.

357
00:12:20,180 --> 00:12:21,540
 Basically when Prohibition came in,

358
00:12:21,540 --> 00:12:23,620
 all the breweries closed down.

359
00:12:23,620 --> 00:12:24,980
 And then when they reopened,

360
00:12:24,980 --> 00:12:26,660
 there was a few more big ones

361
00:12:26,660 --> 00:12:28,940
 and they decided to sell what they knew would sell

362
00:12:28,940 --> 00:12:31,340
 'cause they weren't sure anyone would buy any beer anymore.

363
00:12:31,340 --> 00:12:33,020
 And so they went with the really safe stuff,

364
00:12:33,020 --> 00:12:36,300
 which was the light beers and the mass produced stuff.

365
00:12:36,300 --> 00:12:38,100
 - Okay, now can you explain Hershey's?

366
00:12:38,100 --> 00:12:39,460
 - Hershey's.

367
00:12:39,460 --> 00:12:40,300
 - Tastes like sick.

368
00:12:40,300 --> 00:12:42,140
 - Tastes like sick to British people.

369
00:12:42,140 --> 00:12:44,340
 - Well, you know, it contains some chemicals

370
00:12:44,340 --> 00:12:47,220
 which happen to also taste like sick.

371
00:12:47,220 --> 00:12:49,980
 - I don't know how people have gone around tasting sick.

372
00:12:49,980 --> 00:12:50,820
 They haven't, they haven't.

373
00:12:50,820 --> 00:12:51,660
 They really haven't.

374
00:12:51,660 --> 00:12:52,500
 That's not how it is.

375
00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:53,780
 - Well, if you're eating a Hershey's bar right now,

376
00:12:53,780 --> 00:12:54,980
 please send a photo.

377
00:12:54,980 --> 00:12:56,740
 If you're being sick, if you're, you know.

378
00:12:56,740 --> 00:12:58,300
 - Oh, yes, that one.

379
00:12:58,300 --> 00:13:00,540
 - Podcast at qr.com.

380
00:13:00,540 --> 00:13:02,220
 - Do they have your address?

381
00:13:02,220 --> 00:13:03,420
 'Cause I feel like if they have your address,

382
00:13:03,420 --> 00:13:05,900
 they could send the Mangosteans and the sick,

383
00:13:05,900 --> 00:13:07,740
 et cetera, et cetera, to the address.

384
00:13:07,740 --> 00:13:08,980
 - We've just moved offices.

385
00:13:08,980 --> 00:13:10,540
 And the reason being that the old office

386
00:13:10,540 --> 00:13:12,580
 was just full of sick and Mangosteans.

387
00:13:12,580 --> 00:13:13,860
 - Soon undated, yeah.

388
00:13:13,860 --> 00:13:16,140
 But everyone's tasted sick if they've ever been sick.

389
00:13:16,140 --> 00:13:16,980
 - True.

390
00:13:16,980 --> 00:13:17,820
 - You know.

391
00:13:17,820 --> 00:13:18,660
 - Oh, wow.

392
00:13:18,660 --> 00:13:19,500
 - You just taste it in reverse, don't you?

393
00:13:19,500 --> 00:13:21,620
 Sorry to, I mean to, you know, to lower the tone.

394
00:13:21,620 --> 00:13:22,460
 - That's nasty.

395
00:13:22,460 --> 00:13:24,500
 - That's how we know what American chocolate tastes like.

396
00:13:24,500 --> 00:13:25,340
 - Yeah.

397
00:13:25,340 --> 00:13:26,180
 - Great.

398
00:13:26,180 --> 00:13:27,020
 - Thank you.

399
00:13:27,020 --> 00:13:30,460
 - Could you guys hear about the cherry blossom trees in DC

400
00:13:30,460 --> 00:13:32,540
 and how he's responsible for all of them, basically?

401
00:13:32,540 --> 00:13:35,540
 So, I mean, we have them now in London quite a lot.

402
00:13:35,540 --> 00:13:37,500
 They're very kind of ornamental and very beautiful.

403
00:13:37,500 --> 00:13:38,940
 But he introduced them from Japan.

404
00:13:38,940 --> 00:13:41,620
 And then it became all the rage and people were like queuing

405
00:13:41,620 --> 00:13:43,980
 up to see him and Alexander Graham Bell's daughters.

406
00:13:43,980 --> 00:13:45,140
 - Is that their house, wasn't it?

407
00:13:45,140 --> 00:13:46,340
 He put it to his, yeah.

408
00:13:46,340 --> 00:13:47,580
 - Exactly, exactly.

409
00:13:47,580 --> 00:13:50,900
 And then basically Washington DC was not the beautiful

410
00:13:50,900 --> 00:13:52,700
 metropolis it now is.

411
00:13:52,700 --> 00:13:53,940
 Back then it was kind of ugly.

412
00:13:53,940 --> 00:13:56,620
 And he started saying, well, maybe we should just plant

413
00:13:56,620 --> 00:13:58,380
 some cherry blossom trees around here.

414
00:13:58,380 --> 00:13:59,700
 And that would be kind of beautiful.

415
00:13:59,700 --> 00:14:02,980
 And then the first lady heard of this.

416
00:14:02,980 --> 00:14:06,540
 And before you know it, the Japanese who at this point

417
00:14:06,540 --> 00:14:09,220
 they're not particularly like chummy with.

418
00:14:09,220 --> 00:14:11,100
 They're like, okay, this could be a symbol of friendship.

419
00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:13,660
 If you give us 300 cherry blossom trees,

420
00:14:13,660 --> 00:14:15,540
 we can plant them in DC.

421
00:14:15,540 --> 00:14:19,260
 And the Japanese got carried away, ended up shipping 2000.

422
00:14:19,260 --> 00:14:20,540
 But they opened the crate.

423
00:14:20,540 --> 00:14:22,660
 So I think it was in Seattle and went, oh crap,

424
00:14:22,660 --> 00:14:23,500
 they were diseased.

425
00:14:23,500 --> 00:14:25,860
 They were absolutely infested with invasive species.

426
00:14:25,860 --> 00:14:29,100
 So then they had to publicly burn the symbol of friendship

427
00:14:29,100 --> 00:14:31,580
 between Japan and the US.

428
00:14:31,580 --> 00:14:33,460
 And it was like on the front page of the New York Times.

429
00:14:33,460 --> 00:14:34,980
 - And the thing I read was it was from orders

430
00:14:34,980 --> 00:14:37,580
 of the president, which feels like he should have been busier

431
00:14:37,580 --> 00:14:39,700
 than having to make executive decisions

432
00:14:39,700 --> 00:14:42,020
 of agricultural imports.

433
00:14:42,020 --> 00:14:43,500
 - Although it was his decision, wasn't it?

434
00:14:43,500 --> 00:14:46,060
 Because it was him and the first lady who kind of made

435
00:14:46,060 --> 00:14:47,980
 the decision to bring it over, wasn't it?

436
00:14:47,980 --> 00:14:48,820
 - Wow.

437
00:14:48,820 --> 00:14:50,460
 - But the Japanese were like, are bad.

438
00:14:50,460 --> 00:14:51,980
 And so it was all fine.

439
00:14:51,980 --> 00:14:54,220
 They sent more over and then they are now.

440
00:14:54,220 --> 00:14:56,380
 - And as a result, US-Japanese relations

441
00:14:56,380 --> 00:14:57,780
 stayed very harmonious, didn't they?

442
00:14:57,780 --> 00:14:58,620
 - Yeah.

443
00:14:58,620 --> 00:14:59,620
 - Yeah, good.

444
00:14:59,620 --> 00:15:00,940
 - It was interesting 'cause the ones

445
00:15:00,940 --> 00:15:02,780
 that they sent over the second time,

446
00:15:02,780 --> 00:15:06,020
 they had to make sure that they were really not infested.

447
00:15:06,020 --> 00:15:08,780
 So they raised the trees in virgin soil.

448
00:15:08,780 --> 00:15:10,940
 So the soil was brand new

449
00:15:10,940 --> 00:15:12,940
 and they'd never been anywhere else.

450
00:15:12,940 --> 00:15:16,620
 They wrapped the roots in damp moss to stop any--

451
00:15:16,620 --> 00:15:18,020
 - It's a long work for a friendship man.

452
00:15:18,020 --> 00:15:18,860
 - Yeah.

453
00:15:18,860 --> 00:15:21,300
 - That's great.

454
00:15:21,300 --> 00:15:26,300
 And they fumigated it twice, once to asphyxiate the insects

455
00:15:26,300 --> 00:15:28,060
 and then once just in case.

456
00:15:28,060 --> 00:15:29,580
 (laughing)

457
00:15:29,580 --> 00:15:31,460
 But yeah, and the reason that they did this

458
00:15:31,460 --> 00:15:34,340
 is because this guy, a fair child,

459
00:15:34,340 --> 00:15:38,020
 had a nemesis called Charles Marlatt, didn't he?

460
00:15:38,020 --> 00:15:38,860
 - Yep.

461
00:15:38,860 --> 00:15:39,780
 - This is an amazing story.

462
00:15:39,780 --> 00:15:43,620
 So Charles Marlatt was in charge of the FDA

463
00:15:43,620 --> 00:15:47,860
 sort of anti-insect part of the FDA,

464
00:15:47,860 --> 00:15:49,180
 but they were boyhood friends.

465
00:15:49,180 --> 00:15:53,020
 And actually Marlatt was Fairchild's best man at his wedding.

466
00:15:53,020 --> 00:15:56,220
 But then they fell out because Fairchild basically got

467
00:15:56,220 --> 00:15:58,860
 a load of easy jobs through his friends and family,

468
00:15:58,860 --> 00:16:00,260
 he'll have a bit of nepotism and stuff.

469
00:16:00,260 --> 00:16:02,900
 And Marlatt had to work hard for his job.

470
00:16:02,900 --> 00:16:04,300
 And so they really fell out.

471
00:16:04,300 --> 00:16:06,940
 And Marlatt basically, whenever Fairchild brought in

472
00:16:06,940 --> 00:16:09,100
 any new species, he would be like,

473
00:16:09,100 --> 00:16:10,660
 "Does insects on that get rid of it?

474
00:16:10,660 --> 00:16:12,300
 "Burn it, do it now."

475
00:16:12,300 --> 00:16:13,780
 And so they really, really fell out.

476
00:16:13,780 --> 00:16:15,900
 - I have to defend the entomologist,

477
00:16:15,900 --> 00:16:17,020
 even though I love doing Fairchild.

478
00:16:17,020 --> 00:16:19,940
 So it's worth saying that like Fairchild,

479
00:16:19,940 --> 00:16:22,260
 he did get a lot of fame,

480
00:16:22,260 --> 00:16:23,540
 but a lot of that was off his own back.

481
00:16:23,540 --> 00:16:25,020
 But then, yeah, sure, he married into like

482
00:16:25,020 --> 00:16:26,140
 this really prominent family

483
00:16:26,140 --> 00:16:28,020
 and became really big with National Geographic.

484
00:16:28,020 --> 00:16:31,260
 But today, we would actually side with the entomologist.

485
00:16:31,260 --> 00:16:34,180
 Like, scientifically, he's the sound one.

486
00:16:34,180 --> 00:16:35,420
 Not the botanist just being like,

487
00:16:35,420 --> 00:16:37,020
 "Well, let's just hope it's gonna be fine

488
00:16:37,020 --> 00:16:39,340
 "when we bring all these parts from all over the world."

489
00:16:39,340 --> 00:16:40,180
 - Yeah, definitely.

490
00:16:40,180 --> 00:16:41,660
 - It was dangerous, yeah.

491
00:16:41,660 --> 00:16:43,940
 - I read this amazing story that he wanted to send

492
00:16:43,940 --> 00:16:47,860
 a thousand mangoes back to America,

493
00:16:47,860 --> 00:16:50,260
 but he put them on a boat and they were too heavy.

494
00:16:50,260 --> 00:16:54,100
 And so he solved it by getting a load of local children

495
00:16:54,100 --> 00:16:55,420
 to eat them all.

496
00:16:55,420 --> 00:16:56,260
 - What?

497
00:16:56,260 --> 00:16:57,740
 - Because all he needed were the stones.

498
00:16:57,740 --> 00:17:00,580
 He didn't need the mangoes themselves.

499
00:17:00,580 --> 00:17:02,500
 So he just got all the kids and said,

500
00:17:02,500 --> 00:17:04,260
 "Free mangoes as many as you can eat."

501
00:17:04,260 --> 00:17:05,420
 They all went, "Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no."

502
00:17:05,420 --> 00:17:06,980
 - U.S. diplomacy, there we go.

503
00:17:06,980 --> 00:17:07,820
 That's another...

504
00:17:07,820 --> 00:17:10,140
 - I thought you were gonna say something really clever,

505
00:17:10,140 --> 00:17:13,260
 like, "He only needed to ship the children there."

506
00:17:13,260 --> 00:17:15,140
 - And then they poo the mouse.

507
00:17:15,140 --> 00:17:16,340
 - Exactly, exactly.

508
00:17:16,340 --> 00:17:17,740
 And I was thinking, "Oh, those children are brave,

509
00:17:17,740 --> 00:17:18,820
 "like pooing at a mango stone.

510
00:17:18,820 --> 00:17:19,940
 "That's not funny."

511
00:17:19,940 --> 00:17:22,900
 No, children famously a bit more heavy than a mango as well.

512
00:17:22,900 --> 00:17:25,100
 So, wait was your issue.

513
00:17:25,100 --> 00:17:26,020
 - Oh, no.

514
00:17:26,020 --> 00:17:26,860
 I'm sorry.

515
00:17:26,860 --> 00:17:35,100
 - Okay, it's time for fact number two, and that is James.

516
00:17:35,100 --> 00:17:37,340
 - Okay, my fact this week is that up one stage

517
00:17:37,340 --> 00:17:41,420
 of the 17th century, every woman living on the Yemeni island

518
00:17:41,420 --> 00:17:43,780
 of Sokotra was called Maria.

519
00:17:43,780 --> 00:17:45,780
 - Was it?

520
00:17:45,780 --> 00:17:46,780
 Okay, okay.

521
00:17:46,780 --> 00:17:48,540
 - How many women were on the island?

522
00:17:48,540 --> 00:17:51,500
 - Well, I don't know, but it wasn't completely insignificant.

523
00:17:51,500 --> 00:17:52,460
 It's a big island, right?

524
00:17:52,460 --> 00:17:53,820
 It's about the size of what you've been there.

525
00:17:53,820 --> 00:17:54,660
 - Long Island.

526
00:17:54,660 --> 00:17:55,500
 - It's big, haven't you?

527
00:17:55,500 --> 00:17:56,340
 - Long Island, yeah, yeah.

528
00:17:56,340 --> 00:18:00,900
 - Is it that they were hosting a sound of music reality show?

529
00:18:00,900 --> 00:18:01,740
 - In the 17th century.

530
00:18:01,740 --> 00:18:02,820
 - Oh, yeah, yeah.

531
00:18:02,820 --> 00:18:04,620
 - I feel like it's a real Yemeni vibe.

532
00:18:04,620 --> 00:18:07,140
 It's like the tribesmen and the sound of music.

533
00:18:07,140 --> 00:18:10,900
 - Well, I don't know exactly how many people live there.

534
00:18:10,900 --> 00:18:12,780
 How many people do you say live there now?

535
00:18:12,780 --> 00:18:13,620
 It's in the 10, 10,000.

536
00:18:13,620 --> 00:18:15,020
 - I think it's about 40,000.

537
00:18:15,020 --> 00:18:16,380
 - 40,000, yeah.

538
00:18:16,380 --> 00:18:17,420
 It would have been less then,

539
00:18:17,420 --> 00:18:20,740
 but basically it was a Christian island.

540
00:18:20,740 --> 00:18:23,980
 By tradition, it was St. Thomas who was shipwrecked there

541
00:18:23,980 --> 00:18:25,780
 in the year 52 AD.

542
00:18:25,780 --> 00:18:27,540
 And he supposedly brought in Christianity,

543
00:18:27,540 --> 00:18:30,460
 but definitely the Greeks brought in the 4th century

544
00:18:30,460 --> 00:18:31,980
 that definitely happened.

545
00:18:31,980 --> 00:18:34,340
 And Marco Polo wrote about it in the 13th century

546
00:18:34,340 --> 00:18:35,660
 that there were Christians there.

547
00:18:35,660 --> 00:18:39,220
 And in the 17th century, there was a guy called Padre Vincenzo

548
00:18:39,220 --> 00:18:41,620
 and he visited Socatra.

549
00:18:41,620 --> 00:18:46,180
 And he found that they were still Christian ostensibly,

550
00:18:46,180 --> 00:18:48,860
 but they'd kind of moved to other beliefs

551
00:18:48,860 --> 00:18:51,940
 because Socatra is a place it's very difficult to get to,

552
00:18:51,940 --> 00:18:53,140
 especially at certain times of year,

553
00:18:53,140 --> 00:18:54,180
 you can't really get there at all.

554
00:18:54,180 --> 00:18:56,260
 - The monsoon is, yeah, good luck.

555
00:18:56,260 --> 00:18:58,500
 - And so because they were isolated

556
00:18:58,500 --> 00:19:00,580
 from the rest of the world,

557
00:19:00,580 --> 00:19:02,900
 they kind of had this new version of Christianity.

558
00:19:02,900 --> 00:19:05,540
 So a lot of them were called Maria.

559
00:19:05,540 --> 00:19:07,340
 There were still a lot of churches,

560
00:19:07,340 --> 00:19:09,820
 but for instance, they used to do sacrifices to the moon

561
00:19:09,820 --> 00:19:10,820
 and a few different things.

562
00:19:10,820 --> 00:19:12,420
 - Why not keep some of your old beliefs in?

563
00:19:12,420 --> 00:19:13,620
 Just spice it all up a bit.

564
00:19:13,620 --> 00:19:14,900
 What year was that again?

565
00:19:14,900 --> 00:19:17,100
 - It was in the mid 17th century.

566
00:19:17,100 --> 00:19:18,260
 - Why were they called Maria?

567
00:19:18,260 --> 00:19:20,620
 - Because Mary, the mother of Jesus.

568
00:19:20,620 --> 00:19:23,940
 - Oh, that must have been confusing.

569
00:19:23,940 --> 00:19:25,020
 - Oh, yeah. - No, 'cause they'd...

570
00:19:25,020 --> 00:19:25,860
 - Have you been there?

571
00:19:25,860 --> 00:19:27,540
 - Yeah, so I've been to Socatra.

572
00:19:27,540 --> 00:19:30,700
 It is, I can verify that it's very difficult to get there.

573
00:19:30,700 --> 00:19:31,980
 - Have you met a Maria?

574
00:19:31,980 --> 00:19:33,060
 - I have not met a Maria

575
00:19:33,060 --> 00:19:36,460
 'cause weirdly there's no Christians left on the island.

576
00:19:36,460 --> 00:19:38,180
 - Oh, what's that?

577
00:19:38,180 --> 00:19:39,820
 - Someone's had Maria, come on.

578
00:19:39,820 --> 00:19:43,380
 (all laughing)

579
00:19:43,380 --> 00:19:45,420
 - They're all Muslims now.

580
00:19:45,420 --> 00:19:49,140
 - So I went there kind of 2018, I think, or 2019.

581
00:19:49,140 --> 00:19:50,420
 And we had three options to get there.

582
00:19:50,420 --> 00:19:53,220
 Either we fly in via mainland Yemen,

583
00:19:53,220 --> 00:19:54,540
 but the airport we were flying into

584
00:19:54,540 --> 00:19:56,380
 was on Al Qaeda stronghold.

585
00:19:56,380 --> 00:19:59,620
 So decided maybe that's not the best way of getting in.

586
00:19:59,620 --> 00:20:02,380
 And then the other route was via,

587
00:20:02,380 --> 00:20:04,300
 kind of almost like a private jet via the Emirates,

588
00:20:04,300 --> 00:20:06,220
 the place that you like.

589
00:20:06,220 --> 00:20:09,140
 But they were only giving us verbal permission,

590
00:20:09,140 --> 00:20:10,660
 not written permission.

591
00:20:10,660 --> 00:20:14,540
 And then the third option was to get on a cement cargo ship

592
00:20:14,540 --> 00:20:17,820
 from Oman and sail through pirate waters.

593
00:20:17,820 --> 00:20:19,820
 And the ship was like infested with cockroaches,

594
00:20:19,820 --> 00:20:20,900
 like completely infested.

595
00:20:20,900 --> 00:20:23,620
 And it had like a, the toilet was like a basket

596
00:20:23,620 --> 00:20:25,380
 on the side of the ship, like attached with rope.

597
00:20:25,380 --> 00:20:26,220
 - Is this the route you went?

598
00:20:26,220 --> 00:20:27,060
 - Yeah. - Whoa.

599
00:20:27,060 --> 00:20:28,980
 - Yeah, it was hilarious.

600
00:20:28,980 --> 00:20:30,300
 - No pirates?

601
00:20:30,300 --> 00:20:33,860
 - Yeah, we luckily didn't have, you know.

602
00:20:33,860 --> 00:20:35,660
 The Swede in the group had his wits about him,

603
00:20:35,660 --> 00:20:36,620
 let me tell you that every time,

604
00:20:36,620 --> 00:20:41,100
 every time a ship went past you like just very nervous.

605
00:20:41,100 --> 00:20:43,340
 - But yeah, so it's really hard to get to

606
00:20:43,340 --> 00:20:44,180
 and that's the thing, right?

607
00:20:44,180 --> 00:20:45,980
 But then that's good news for other things.

608
00:20:45,980 --> 00:20:48,580
 So it means that they have amazing biodiversity there.

609
00:20:48,580 --> 00:20:50,260
 - Yeah, you've seen the trees there, there.

610
00:20:50,260 --> 00:20:51,420
 - They look incredible.

611
00:20:51,420 --> 00:20:52,460
 I mean, the dragonblood tree,

612
00:20:52,460 --> 00:20:54,460
 I know that's the most famous really,

613
00:20:54,460 --> 00:20:56,860
 that's the sort of like the headline tree out there,

614
00:20:56,860 --> 00:20:58,020
 but they do look beautiful.

615
00:20:58,020 --> 00:20:58,860
 - They're beautiful.

616
00:20:58,860 --> 00:20:59,700
 - They look, they're described,

617
00:20:59,700 --> 00:21:00,540
 if you'd want to picture it,

618
00:21:00,540 --> 00:21:02,220
 they're described as sort of looking like umbrellas.

619
00:21:02,220 --> 00:21:04,860
 But a lot of them look like umbrellas with a high wind

620
00:21:04,860 --> 00:21:07,420
 where you know when your umbrella flips on side out

621
00:21:07,420 --> 00:21:09,500
 'cause you see the stems coming up

622
00:21:09,500 --> 00:21:12,860
 and they're known for the fact that if the sap comes out,

623
00:21:12,860 --> 00:21:15,620
 it's red sap, hence the kind of dragonblood thing.

624
00:21:15,620 --> 00:21:17,420
 And they've been exporting that for years

625
00:21:17,420 --> 00:21:20,820
 and it's been used for all sorts of like nail polish

626
00:21:20,820 --> 00:21:23,060
 and medicines and so on.

627
00:21:23,060 --> 00:21:24,260
 - Smirring gladiators?

628
00:21:24,260 --> 00:21:25,100
 - Really? - Really?

629
00:21:25,100 --> 00:21:27,420
 - I think gladiators supposedly had a bit of it

630
00:21:27,420 --> 00:21:30,420
 to smear them as decoration and a bit as disinfectant.

631
00:21:30,420 --> 00:21:32,300
 But the thing is that the tree,

632
00:21:32,300 --> 00:21:34,180
 I think it only exists there now,

633
00:21:34,180 --> 00:21:37,020
 but pollen has been found all around the Mediterranean

634
00:21:37,020 --> 00:21:39,340
 as in fossilized or archeologists

635
00:21:39,340 --> 00:21:40,620
 have found pollen of it around the Med.

636
00:21:40,620 --> 00:21:43,100
 So this is what the Med used to look like.

637
00:21:43,100 --> 00:21:45,300
 There used to be these trees much more commonly.

638
00:21:45,300 --> 00:21:46,140
 - So the dragon's blood tree,

639
00:21:46,140 --> 00:21:48,620
 there's different species of dragon's blood.

640
00:21:48,620 --> 00:21:50,780
 And there are still what we call

641
00:21:50,780 --> 00:21:52,700
 in biology relic populations.

642
00:21:52,700 --> 00:21:55,540
 So kind of populations that are on their last leg in Socotra,

643
00:21:55,540 --> 00:21:57,620
 but there's different species of dragon's blood

644
00:21:57,620 --> 00:21:59,340
 in the Canary Islands.

645
00:21:59,340 --> 00:22:00,700
 There's another species in Ouan

646
00:22:00,700 --> 00:22:02,340
 and kind of a remote part of Oman.

647
00:22:02,340 --> 00:22:04,820
 And it looks like the dragon's blood tree

648
00:22:04,820 --> 00:22:07,580
 was like a really dominant tree

649
00:22:07,580 --> 00:22:10,980
 in the whole of kind of that old world.

650
00:22:10,980 --> 00:22:12,380
 It's kind of old school.

651
00:22:12,380 --> 00:22:14,860
 It should kind of really be on its out and it is.

652
00:22:14,860 --> 00:22:15,700
 - But it is right.

653
00:22:15,700 --> 00:22:17,380
 They're saying possibly in the next 80 years,

654
00:22:17,380 --> 00:22:18,220
 if we're not careful,

655
00:22:18,220 --> 00:22:21,100
 it's gonna be an extinct species of tree.

656
00:22:21,100 --> 00:22:22,780
 And it's so interesting how it survives

657
00:22:22,780 --> 00:22:25,140
 'cause most trees obviously get their water

658
00:22:25,140 --> 00:22:26,500
 through the roots under the ground.

659
00:22:26,500 --> 00:22:29,300
 But this tree has worked out a way.

660
00:22:29,300 --> 00:22:31,140
 I don't know if that's a language you use about trees,

661
00:22:31,140 --> 00:22:33,500
 but it's got the ability to take in the moisture

662
00:22:33,500 --> 00:22:35,180
 of the clouds that are going above it.

663
00:22:35,180 --> 00:22:38,220
 So it can pull from above as well as below,

664
00:22:38,220 --> 00:22:39,540
 which is pretty amazing.

665
00:22:39,540 --> 00:22:42,140
 - It injects much more water into the soil

666
00:22:42,140 --> 00:22:43,500
 from the air than it gets in rainfall.

667
00:22:43,500 --> 00:22:45,060
 'Cause sometimes it's foggy and cloudy

668
00:22:45,060 --> 00:22:46,620
 and it sort of sucks all that.

669
00:22:46,620 --> 00:22:48,980
 It's called horizontal precipitation capture,

670
00:22:48,980 --> 00:22:50,500
 which is as it sounds.

671
00:22:50,500 --> 00:22:53,540
 But they've got I think 92 different plant species

672
00:22:53,540 --> 00:22:54,660
 which live in the undergrowth.

673
00:22:54,660 --> 00:22:56,300
 The few surveys have found that.

674
00:22:56,300 --> 00:22:58,140
 And seven of them are only found

675
00:22:58,140 --> 00:23:00,260
 living in the undergrowth of the dragon's blood tree.

676
00:23:00,260 --> 00:23:01,300
 That's mad.

677
00:23:01,300 --> 00:23:02,140
 - That's so cool.

678
00:23:02,140 --> 00:23:04,180
 - I suppose that would make it an umbrella species.

679
00:23:04,180 --> 00:23:05,260
 It looks like an umbrella.

680
00:23:05,260 --> 00:23:06,100
 - Oh!

681
00:23:06,100 --> 00:23:09,060
 - I'll tell you what, at National Geographic,

682
00:23:09,060 --> 00:23:10,540
 they go wild for that long.

683
00:23:10,540 --> 00:23:11,380
 - Yeah, yeah.

684
00:23:11,380 --> 00:23:12,900
 - I mean, when you turn up there,

685
00:23:12,900 --> 00:23:15,260
 I'm not gonna lie, you're like, what is this place?

686
00:23:15,260 --> 00:23:17,300
 It looks, there's so few places on Earth

687
00:23:17,300 --> 00:23:18,140
 where you look at them and you go,

688
00:23:18,140 --> 00:23:19,740
 "Oh, that looks really alien."

689
00:23:19,740 --> 00:23:22,660
 Like that's a really unusual landscape.

690
00:23:22,660 --> 00:23:25,260
 And cicotra is definitely that, like these canyons,

691
00:23:25,260 --> 00:23:27,780
 like Grand Canyon or more obviously not that scale,

692
00:23:27,780 --> 00:23:29,740
 but with these dragon blood trees.

693
00:23:29,740 --> 00:23:31,100
 And other trees as well, you know,

694
00:23:31,100 --> 00:23:32,700
 and giant snails and a bunch of stuff

695
00:23:32,700 --> 00:23:34,220
 that you're just like, "What is this?"

696
00:23:34,220 --> 00:23:35,940
 - Well, Ella, I can ask you,

697
00:23:35,940 --> 00:23:37,700
 as the only one who's been there,

698
00:23:37,700 --> 00:23:40,700
 did it seem to you at all like the atmosphere

699
00:23:40,700 --> 00:23:45,700
 of the planet Pandora in the global mega hit avatar films?

700
00:23:45,700 --> 00:23:49,460
 - Okay, okay, actually this is a good crowd

701
00:23:49,460 --> 00:23:52,940
 to ask this because I've heard that as well,

702
00:23:52,940 --> 00:23:54,940
 but that was an inspiration.

703
00:23:54,940 --> 00:23:57,540
 And I wondered if we knew what the source of that was

704
00:23:57,540 --> 00:23:59,300
 because I could, here's the thing,

705
00:23:59,300 --> 00:24:00,780
 the thing with cicotra is,

706
00:24:00,780 --> 00:24:02,980
 if you speak to people that are really in the know,

707
00:24:02,980 --> 00:24:05,980
 so people, the kind of off the beat travelers,

708
00:24:05,980 --> 00:24:08,140
 people that are very interested in kind of biology,

709
00:24:08,140 --> 00:24:09,820
 that kind of thing, they all know cicotra.

710
00:24:09,820 --> 00:24:11,660
 It's like this hidden secret

711
00:24:11,660 --> 00:24:14,900
 that actually everybody in a certain industry knows about.

712
00:24:14,900 --> 00:24:17,020
 Like, you know, and it's on people's dreams.

713
00:24:17,020 --> 00:24:18,220
 I've met very rich people

714
00:24:18,220 --> 00:24:19,660
 that are desperate for me to take them to cicotra.

715
00:24:19,660 --> 00:24:21,860
 And I'm like, sure, once I've dealt with the pirate situation,

716
00:24:21,860 --> 00:24:23,900
 I will get you, and you're very rich.

717
00:24:23,900 --> 00:24:27,180
 - Cue of wizards Texans just waiting to be.

718
00:24:27,180 --> 00:24:28,780
 - But yeah, I wondered about that

719
00:24:28,780 --> 00:24:30,420
 because I was like, I can see that,

720
00:24:30,420 --> 00:24:31,940
 but I just wonder what the source is.

721
00:24:31,940 --> 00:24:34,580
 'Cause I just, being that we care about fact here, guys,

722
00:24:34,580 --> 00:24:35,420
 right? - Yeah.

723
00:24:35,420 --> 00:24:36,260
 - Right? - Yeah.

724
00:24:36,260 --> 00:24:37,100
 - Right? - Sure.

725
00:24:37,100 --> 00:24:37,940
 - I need more.

726
00:24:37,940 --> 00:24:39,020
 - Well, there's one thing we care about more than facts,

727
00:24:39,020 --> 00:24:40,220
 and that's the continued success

728
00:24:40,220 --> 00:24:42,300
 of the way of water franchise.

729
00:24:42,300 --> 00:24:44,180
 (laughing)

730
00:24:44,180 --> 00:24:45,220
 Nevermind, nevermind, nevermind.

731
00:24:45,220 --> 00:24:48,980
 - Just on the Christianity in Yemen in the 17th century,

732
00:24:48,980 --> 00:24:52,420
 this was what Padre Vincenza was talking about.

733
00:24:52,420 --> 00:24:53,860
 A few weird things that they did.

734
00:24:53,860 --> 00:24:56,700
 They had a priest called Adambo,

735
00:24:56,700 --> 00:24:58,620
 who was elected by the people

736
00:24:58,620 --> 00:25:00,340
 and changed every single year.

737
00:25:00,340 --> 00:25:03,820
 Just like almost like an archbishop of the island.

738
00:25:03,820 --> 00:25:05,420
 - But democratic. - But democratic.

739
00:25:05,420 --> 00:25:06,260
 That's quite cool, isn't it?

740
00:25:06,260 --> 00:25:07,100
 - Yeah, very cool.

741
00:25:07,100 --> 00:25:08,340
 - Let me tell you about modern day Yemen.

742
00:25:08,340 --> 00:25:10,300
 (laughing)

743
00:25:10,300 --> 00:25:12,060
 - The other thing is, in the churches,

744
00:25:12,060 --> 00:25:15,380
 they had like a, what would you call it, like an altar,

745
00:25:15,380 --> 00:25:18,100
 and every day they would smear it with butter.

746
00:25:18,100 --> 00:25:19,420
 - Oh, lovely.

747
00:25:19,420 --> 00:25:20,260
 - That does sound kind of--

748
00:25:20,260 --> 00:25:21,220
 - What for what reason?

749
00:25:21,220 --> 00:25:22,940
 - Yeah, do they slide along it?

750
00:25:22,940 --> 00:25:24,980
 (laughing)

751
00:25:24,980 --> 00:25:25,820
 'Cause that would be a great way

752
00:25:25,820 --> 00:25:27,020
 of starting a service, wouldn't it?

753
00:25:27,020 --> 00:25:28,860
 - You know, whoosh, I'm here.

754
00:25:28,860 --> 00:25:30,900
 - Was it sort of like, you're going up for your body of Christ?

755
00:25:30,900 --> 00:25:32,340
 Would you like some butter?

756
00:25:32,340 --> 00:25:33,300
 (laughing)

757
00:25:33,300 --> 00:25:34,860
 - I don't know how this is just the fantasies

758
00:25:34,860 --> 00:25:36,220
 of these two heathens.

759
00:25:36,220 --> 00:25:39,900
 That's what would take those two heathens back to church.

760
00:25:39,900 --> 00:25:41,340
 - I've got a general Yemen fact.

761
00:25:41,340 --> 00:25:42,460
 - Oh, yeah. - Yeah.

762
00:25:42,460 --> 00:25:44,180
 - During, so Yemen, I think,

763
00:25:44,180 --> 00:25:46,860
 used to be a British colony protectorate.

764
00:25:46,860 --> 00:25:47,700
 - Protectorate the south of it.

765
00:25:47,700 --> 00:25:49,340
 - That's safe to say about anywhere in the world.

766
00:25:49,340 --> 00:25:50,180
 - Yeah.

767
00:25:50,180 --> 00:25:51,020
 (laughing)

768
00:25:51,020 --> 00:25:53,700
 - The British were involved in something.

769
00:25:53,700 --> 00:25:54,860
 - Well, you know, yeah.

770
00:25:54,860 --> 00:25:58,780
 - So during that era, the port of Aden, which was,

771
00:25:58,780 --> 00:26:01,180
 and I think even after the rest of Yemen might have gained it,

772
00:26:01,180 --> 00:26:03,580
 it depends, Aden maintained a kind of special status.

773
00:26:03,580 --> 00:26:07,260
 Basically, Aden was in a pretty constant state of emergency.

774
00:26:07,260 --> 00:26:08,980
 Things were so dicey there

775
00:26:08,980 --> 00:26:10,700
 that British citizens living there were issued

776
00:26:10,700 --> 00:26:13,100
 pretty much as standard with revolvers

777
00:26:13,100 --> 00:26:15,540
 in case of assassination attempts on them.

778
00:26:15,540 --> 00:26:16,900
 Imagine that, imagine just moving to somewhere

779
00:26:16,900 --> 00:26:18,420
 and being fitted with a revolver.

780
00:26:18,420 --> 00:26:19,860
 - Yeah, Yemen's an interesting place.

781
00:26:19,860 --> 00:26:22,540
 Like, during, so there was a revolution

782
00:26:22,540 --> 00:26:24,060
 and obviously now there's a war.

783
00:26:24,060 --> 00:26:27,420
 And there was like a protest and outside the protest,

784
00:26:27,420 --> 00:26:29,460
 it says, "No bazookas."

785
00:26:29,460 --> 00:26:30,300
 (laughing)

786
00:26:30,300 --> 00:26:31,140
 - So you were allowed to...

787
00:26:31,140 --> 00:26:31,980
 - Wow.

788
00:26:31,980 --> 00:26:33,580
 (laughing)

789
00:26:33,580 --> 00:26:34,700
 - Other way, but just no bazookas.

790
00:26:34,700 --> 00:26:37,060
 We're drawing the line of, oh, and land mines.

791
00:26:37,060 --> 00:26:39,420
 They were like, "No bazookas and no hand grenades."

792
00:26:39,420 --> 00:26:40,260
 - Oh my God.

793
00:26:40,260 --> 00:26:41,100
 - That's so funny.

794
00:26:41,100 --> 00:26:42,420
 'Cause like, we just had protests here.

795
00:26:42,420 --> 00:26:43,740
 And if you brought like a...

796
00:26:43,740 --> 00:26:44,580
 - A whistle.

797
00:26:44,580 --> 00:26:45,980
 - A whistle or a luggage tag,

798
00:26:45,980 --> 00:26:48,020
 they'd kind of ship your way to prison.

799
00:26:48,020 --> 00:26:48,860
 - Yeah, no, no, no, no.

800
00:26:48,860 --> 00:26:50,660
 But in defense of my parents' home land,

801
00:26:50,660 --> 00:26:52,780
 I will say it is a,

802
00:26:52,780 --> 00:26:54,500
 have you seen pictures of mainland Yemen

803
00:26:54,500 --> 00:26:55,340
 and the island of Scotland?

804
00:26:55,340 --> 00:26:57,660
 It's the most stunning place.

805
00:26:57,660 --> 00:26:59,020
 And I know, like, I'm biased,

806
00:26:59,020 --> 00:27:01,140
 but it is absolutely absolutely beautiful.

807
00:27:01,140 --> 00:27:02,300
 - I saw a photo of a place.

808
00:27:02,300 --> 00:27:03,580
 I wonder if you've seen it in person.

809
00:27:03,580 --> 00:27:05,580
 You've been there quite a few times, right?

810
00:27:05,580 --> 00:27:07,620
 It's described as the Manhattan of the desert.

811
00:27:07,620 --> 00:27:08,460
 - Yes.

812
00:27:08,460 --> 00:27:09,300
 - I mean, it sounds incredible.

813
00:27:09,300 --> 00:27:11,620
 That was Freya Stark, explorer who called it that

814
00:27:11,620 --> 00:27:12,540
 in the 1930s.

815
00:27:12,540 --> 00:27:16,020
 But this is a 16th century walled city

816
00:27:16,020 --> 00:27:18,860
 that was the first ever city of skyscrapers.

817
00:27:18,860 --> 00:27:20,740
 They went seven floors high

818
00:27:20,740 --> 00:27:23,020
 and the buildings were made of mud.

819
00:27:23,020 --> 00:27:24,180
 It was just a mud trouble.

820
00:27:24,180 --> 00:27:25,020
 - And higher actually.

821
00:27:25,020 --> 00:27:25,860
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

822
00:27:25,860 --> 00:27:27,340
 - And there's still, obviously,

823
00:27:27,340 --> 00:27:29,140
 there's been renovations and so on,

824
00:27:29,140 --> 00:27:30,340
 but is there anything original?

825
00:27:30,340 --> 00:27:31,180
 - Oh, it's all there.

826
00:27:31,180 --> 00:27:33,500
 Yeah, so it's a UNESCO World Heritage Site.

827
00:27:33,500 --> 00:27:34,660
 Again, so it's,

828
00:27:34,660 --> 00:27:36,620
 so Sokotra is also a UNESCO World Heritage Site.

829
00:27:36,620 --> 00:27:38,500
 And it's basically buildings,

830
00:27:38,500 --> 00:27:40,580
 10, 11, whatever, stories high.

831
00:27:40,580 --> 00:27:43,660
 The really cute thing is that

832
00:27:43,660 --> 00:27:46,140
 some of those houses have bridges

833
00:27:46,140 --> 00:27:47,180
 on the top of the houses

834
00:27:47,180 --> 00:27:48,220
 because people can't be bothered

835
00:27:48,220 --> 00:27:49,140
 to go all the way downstairs.

836
00:27:49,140 --> 00:27:49,980
 'Cause I have elevators.

837
00:27:49,980 --> 00:27:52,180
 They're like, right, historic buildings, right?

838
00:27:52,180 --> 00:27:53,300
 So they, instead of going all the way

839
00:27:53,300 --> 00:27:54,500
 downstairs to go visit the neighbors,

840
00:27:54,500 --> 00:27:56,860
 they just go to the top,

841
00:27:56,860 --> 00:27:57,820
 which they call the drill band.

842
00:27:57,820 --> 00:28:00,380
 They just leg it along these little bridges.

843
00:28:00,380 --> 00:28:01,220
 - But the thing is, it's so old

844
00:28:01,220 --> 00:28:02,060
 and it's still inhabited.

845
00:28:02,060 --> 00:28:02,900
 That's the amazing.

846
00:28:02,900 --> 00:28:03,740
 - Oh, no, no, it's inhabited.

847
00:28:03,740 --> 00:28:04,700
 It's completely inhabited.

848
00:28:04,700 --> 00:28:06,420
 It's a lived in and World Heritage Site.

849
00:28:06,420 --> 00:28:07,260
 It's great.

850
00:28:07,260 --> 00:28:08,100
 I mean, when you turn up there,

851
00:28:08,100 --> 00:28:09,620
 you're like, are you kidding?

852
00:28:09,620 --> 00:28:12,260
 So bazookas and pistols, yes,

853
00:28:12,260 --> 00:28:14,020
 but also heritage.

854
00:28:14,020 --> 00:28:14,860
 - It was the...

855
00:28:14,860 --> 00:28:16,380
 - Go visit, guys.

856
00:28:16,380 --> 00:28:18,340
 - It was the only place you could get coffee from

857
00:28:18,340 --> 00:28:21,900
 for 200 years until one of these people

858
00:28:21,900 --> 00:28:24,180
 who stole plants went in.

859
00:28:24,180 --> 00:28:25,020
 (laughing)

860
00:28:25,020 --> 00:28:25,860
 - You're hero, Zala.

861
00:28:25,860 --> 00:28:27,580
 - Suddenly, I don't like them.

862
00:28:27,580 --> 00:28:29,860
 Went in, nicked all the coffee.

863
00:28:29,860 --> 00:28:32,500
 And if Mocha, which is the place

864
00:28:32,500 --> 00:28:34,620
 where the coffee was exported from,

865
00:28:34,620 --> 00:28:36,700
 if they still had the monopoly on coffee,

866
00:28:36,700 --> 00:28:38,620
 there would be enough money for everyone in Yemen

867
00:28:38,620 --> 00:28:41,380
 to get a payment of $16,000 per year

868
00:28:41,380 --> 00:28:42,540
 on top of anything else they earned.

869
00:28:42,540 --> 00:28:43,380
 - Are you kidding me?

870
00:28:43,380 --> 00:28:44,500
 - And that would be eight times higher

871
00:28:44,500 --> 00:28:47,380
 than the actual average salary of a person from Yemen.

872
00:28:47,380 --> 00:28:48,420
 - Wow.

873
00:28:48,420 --> 00:28:49,260
 - So yeah.

874
00:28:49,260 --> 00:28:53,660
 Just one more thing on Marys.

875
00:28:53,660 --> 00:28:54,500
 - Oh yeah.

876
00:28:54,500 --> 00:28:56,020
 - At the end of the 18th century,

877
00:28:56,020 --> 00:28:58,580
 24% of women in England were called Mary.

878
00:28:58,580 --> 00:29:01,500
 - The secotra of the North, so called it.

879
00:29:01,500 --> 00:29:02,660
 (laughing)

880
00:29:02,660 --> 00:29:04,980
 - And in Vexan, which is in France,

881
00:29:04,980 --> 00:29:06,900
 just Northwest of Paris,

882
00:29:06,900 --> 00:29:11,900
 in 1740, 68.4% of women were called Mary.

883
00:29:11,900 --> 00:29:13,140
 - What?

884
00:29:13,140 --> 00:29:15,140
 - Or Marie, it would be.

885
00:29:15,140 --> 00:29:17,620
 - Do any of you have Marys in your family?

886
00:29:17,620 --> 00:29:18,620
 - I have a cousin.

887
00:29:18,620 --> 00:29:20,700
 - Yeah, my, Rosemary is my auntie.

888
00:29:20,700 --> 00:29:22,180
 So there's, yeah, I wonder if it's that,

889
00:29:22,180 --> 00:29:23,260
 if it's the double barrel first.

890
00:29:23,260 --> 00:29:25,180
 - Well, in France, that's what happens.

891
00:29:25,180 --> 00:29:27,900
 So around that time, around the 18th century,

892
00:29:27,900 --> 00:29:29,740
 they started doing the double names,

893
00:29:29,740 --> 00:29:32,940
 so you could have Marie Claire or Marie, whatever.

894
00:29:32,940 --> 00:29:35,060
 And yeah, so they started almost,

895
00:29:35,060 --> 00:29:36,660
 everyone was called Marie something.

896
00:29:36,660 --> 00:29:37,660
 - Oh.

897
00:29:37,660 --> 00:29:42,460
 - In 1379, 33% of the male population of Sheffield

898
00:29:42,460 --> 00:29:46,620
 were called John, and 22% of the women were called Alice.

899
00:29:46,620 --> 00:29:49,860
 - John and Alice have invited us round.

900
00:29:49,860 --> 00:29:50,860
 - Be more specific!

901
00:29:50,860 --> 00:29:52,660
 (laughing)

902
00:29:52,660 --> 00:29:53,580
 - That's us!

903
00:29:53,580 --> 00:29:55,420
 (laughing)

904
00:29:55,420 --> 00:29:58,000
 (upbeat music)

905
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:02,660
 - Okay, it is time for fact number three,

906
00:30:02,660 --> 00:30:04,820
 and that is Andy.

907
00:30:04,820 --> 00:30:06,820
 - My fact is that during the Second World War,

908
00:30:06,820 --> 00:30:09,060
 the making of Spitfires was so secret

909
00:30:09,060 --> 00:30:10,940
 that one married couple didn't know

910
00:30:10,940 --> 00:30:12,440
 they were both working on it.

911
00:30:12,440 --> 00:30:13,460
 - Was that John and Alice?

912
00:30:13,460 --> 00:30:14,980
 - It was John and Alice.

913
00:30:14,980 --> 00:30:15,820
 - That's cool.

914
00:30:15,820 --> 00:30:16,660
 - It's so weird.

915
00:30:16,660 --> 00:30:17,740
 - I wonder if they both thought

916
00:30:17,740 --> 00:30:19,180
 that the other was having enough.

917
00:30:19,180 --> 00:30:20,980
 - I know, imagine them going to work in the morning,

918
00:30:20,980 --> 00:30:22,620
 playing off to work.

919
00:30:22,620 --> 00:30:23,540
 - Yeah, me too.

920
00:30:23,540 --> 00:30:25,700
 - Okay. - See you later.

921
00:30:25,700 --> 00:30:26,860
 - I'm going in this direction.

922
00:30:26,860 --> 00:30:27,700
 - Oh.

923
00:30:27,700 --> 00:30:29,180
 (laughing)

924
00:30:29,180 --> 00:30:31,780
 - I'll just pop back to the house for a minute.

925
00:30:31,780 --> 00:30:32,960
 - Who's there somewhere at work,

926
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:35,580
 whose job it was to keep them apart as well?

927
00:30:35,580 --> 00:30:38,060
 A nightmare life of the coming to the canteen

928
00:30:38,060 --> 00:30:38,900
 at the same time.

929
00:30:38,900 --> 00:30:41,140
 Oh, hey, what are you coming for?

930
00:30:42,260 --> 00:30:43,100
 - It's such a weird fact.

931
00:30:43,100 --> 00:30:44,520
 - How did they find out?

932
00:30:44,520 --> 00:30:45,360
 So many questions.

933
00:30:45,360 --> 00:30:46,600
 - They found out decades later.

934
00:30:46,600 --> 00:30:47,980
 That's the crazy thing.

935
00:30:47,980 --> 00:30:48,980
 So this is a slight--

936
00:30:48,980 --> 00:30:50,600
 - Was that the only secret thing they were working?

937
00:30:50,600 --> 00:30:51,440
 I have so many questions.

938
00:30:51,440 --> 00:30:52,720
 Was that the only secret thing they were working on?

939
00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:53,560
 - I think they were both working

940
00:30:53,560 --> 00:30:54,680
 in this specific factory.

941
00:30:54,680 --> 00:30:56,520
 - The same factory even?

942
00:30:56,520 --> 00:30:58,080
 - Yeah, it was the same factory, yeah, yeah.

943
00:30:58,080 --> 00:30:58,920
 But so this is--

944
00:30:58,920 --> 00:31:00,560
 - I mean, they might be idiots, guys.

945
00:31:00,560 --> 00:31:02,720
 (laughing)

946
00:31:02,720 --> 00:31:04,520
 - Basically, for anyone who doesn't know,

947
00:31:04,520 --> 00:31:05,680
 we're talking about the Spitfire,

948
00:31:05,680 --> 00:31:07,480
 the Super Marine Spitfires legendary plane

949
00:31:07,480 --> 00:31:10,360
 of the Second World War and big thing in Britain,

950
00:31:10,360 --> 00:31:13,300
 a kind of national myth item in Britain, the Spitfire.

951
00:31:13,300 --> 00:31:14,820
 And there was a factory in Southampton,

952
00:31:14,820 --> 00:31:17,100
 which made, I think, most of the Spitfires,

953
00:31:17,100 --> 00:31:19,820
 and it was bombed in 1940 by the Luftwaffe,

954
00:31:19,820 --> 00:31:21,460
 and it was not just bombed, it was flattened,

955
00:31:21,460 --> 00:31:23,180
 and this was a disaster.

956
00:31:23,180 --> 00:31:25,420
 And they needed to work out how to, you know,

957
00:31:25,420 --> 00:31:26,860
 keep Spitfire production going,

958
00:31:26,860 --> 00:31:28,460
 but keep it safe from bombing raids.

959
00:31:28,460 --> 00:31:29,700
 And what they did was they said,

960
00:31:29,700 --> 00:31:31,260
 well, we'll make it in secret.

961
00:31:31,260 --> 00:31:32,980
 And not only that, we'll divide all the factories

962
00:31:32,980 --> 00:31:35,420
 into, you know, lots of different tiny micro factories

963
00:31:35,420 --> 00:31:37,020
 around the place, which are all hidden.

964
00:31:37,020 --> 00:31:39,980
 So they used all sorts of little offices or garages,

965
00:31:39,980 --> 00:31:43,160
 a laundry, an old glove factory, they just divide,

966
00:31:43,160 --> 00:31:45,440
 it was amazing, they just divided it up.

967
00:31:45,440 --> 00:31:47,120
 And lots of them were in Salisbury and Reading

968
00:31:47,120 --> 00:31:49,840
 and Trowbridge and just like all over the place, basically.

969
00:31:49,840 --> 00:31:51,920
 And this came out decades after the war,

970
00:31:51,920 --> 00:31:54,200
 that this is how it had been done, basically.

971
00:31:54,200 --> 00:31:56,400
 And there was an engineer who worked on them

972
00:31:56,400 --> 00:31:58,680
 called Norman Parker, and he said in 2021,

973
00:31:58,680 --> 00:32:00,120
 he was interviewed about it.

974
00:32:00,120 --> 00:32:02,840
 He was about 95 at the time that he was talking about this.

975
00:32:02,840 --> 00:32:04,440
 He said, "We had one case, there was a couple

976
00:32:04,440 --> 00:32:06,160
 at a dinner party in the 1970s,

977
00:32:06,160 --> 00:32:07,880
 and over the dinner table, the wife said,

978
00:32:07,880 --> 00:32:11,020
 "Oh, I was building Spitfires in Salisbury during the war."

979
00:32:11,020 --> 00:32:14,260
 And the husband said, "No, you weren't, I was."

980
00:32:14,260 --> 00:32:16,020
 And they had both been working in the same factory

981
00:32:16,020 --> 00:32:16,860
 and they didn't know it.

982
00:32:16,860 --> 00:32:19,820
 - It could be a false memory, I guess.

983
00:32:19,820 --> 00:32:21,580
 - I think this is a really bad marriage, guys.

984
00:32:21,580 --> 00:32:22,420
 - Yeah.

985
00:32:22,420 --> 00:32:23,260
 - I've got-

986
00:32:23,260 --> 00:32:24,100
 - Well, there are a number of things

987
00:32:24,100 --> 00:32:25,540
 it could have been, but basically.

988
00:32:25,540 --> 00:32:27,020
 (laughing)

989
00:32:27,020 --> 00:32:27,860
 - Yeah.

990
00:32:27,860 --> 00:32:29,740
 - I reckon I have things with my siblings

991
00:32:29,740 --> 00:32:32,260
 that we talk about when we were really, really young.

992
00:32:32,260 --> 00:32:34,060
 And we all think that we were the one

993
00:32:34,060 --> 00:32:35,380
 who did a certain thing.

994
00:32:35,380 --> 00:32:36,220
 - Oh, right.

995
00:32:36,220 --> 00:32:37,060
 - Do you know what I mean?

996
00:32:37,060 --> 00:32:38,740
 - Yeah, I see, you're throwing shade on the-

997
00:32:38,740 --> 00:32:40,940
 - I'm not saying that's true, but I'm just saying,

998
00:32:40,940 --> 00:32:44,780
 I remember I was, my brother was locked in a toilet

999
00:32:44,780 --> 00:32:46,500
 in France when we went to a restaurant once

1000
00:32:46,500 --> 00:32:47,420
 and we had to get him out.

1001
00:32:47,420 --> 00:32:49,460
 And then he thinks it was my sister who was that.

1002
00:32:49,460 --> 00:32:50,300
 Do you know what I mean?

1003
00:32:50,300 --> 00:32:52,580
 So it's like, weirdo.

1004
00:32:52,580 --> 00:32:53,620
 - Yeah, yeah.

1005
00:32:53,620 --> 00:32:56,060
 - Or it could be that they're telling the truth

1006
00:32:56,060 --> 00:32:57,100
 and it's a real thing.

1007
00:32:57,100 --> 00:32:58,420
 (laughing)

1008
00:32:58,420 --> 00:33:00,980
 - Do we know what they worked on specifically?

1009
00:33:00,980 --> 00:33:01,980
 - Well, that's the other thing,

1010
00:33:01,980 --> 00:33:03,900
 production was divvied up in lots of ways.

1011
00:33:03,900 --> 00:33:06,080
 So it might have been by same factory.

1012
00:33:06,080 --> 00:33:08,180
 It was a factory, it was at different sites

1013
00:33:08,180 --> 00:33:10,500
 or it was a, you know, they probably weren't in the same room.

1014
00:33:10,500 --> 00:33:12,220
 - He could have been making the leather chairs

1015
00:33:12,220 --> 00:33:14,340
 for what could be used for a car, but it was for a plane.

1016
00:33:14,340 --> 00:33:15,180
 And as in like-

1017
00:33:15,180 --> 00:33:16,020
 - Sure, yeah, yeah.

1018
00:33:16,020 --> 00:33:16,860
 - That's what I mean, to the level

1019
00:33:16,860 --> 00:33:17,700
 of what were they making.

1020
00:33:17,700 --> 00:33:18,540
 - Exactly, yeah.

1021
00:33:18,540 --> 00:33:19,380
 - The spitfire.

1022
00:33:19,380 --> 00:33:20,420
 - It's plausible, for sure.

1023
00:33:20,420 --> 00:33:21,260
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1024
00:33:21,260 --> 00:33:22,100
 - I mean, it's-

1025
00:33:22,100 --> 00:33:22,940
 - I think they sort of dug into it.

1026
00:33:22,940 --> 00:33:23,780
 - And everyone was very secretive.

1027
00:33:23,780 --> 00:33:24,620
 - And people were very secretive.

1028
00:33:24,620 --> 00:33:26,420
 Or you might know in a couple,

1029
00:33:26,420 --> 00:33:27,900
 I'm working on something that's secret

1030
00:33:27,900 --> 00:33:29,580
 and I can't really tell you what it's about.

1031
00:33:29,580 --> 00:33:31,620
 And they're both in war work.

1032
00:33:31,620 --> 00:33:33,880
 And the thing is about aviation, during the Second World War,

1033
00:33:33,880 --> 00:33:36,560
 65% of the aviation workforce were women

1034
00:33:36,560 --> 00:33:38,100
 because most of the men were in the arm.

1035
00:33:38,100 --> 00:33:40,800
 - So statistically, she's more likely to be correct.

1036
00:33:40,800 --> 00:33:41,920
 - Absolutely, yeah.

1037
00:33:41,920 --> 00:33:44,760
 Like I say, I think they're both correct.

1038
00:33:44,760 --> 00:33:46,560
 - So she's told this guy at the dinner table,

1039
00:33:46,560 --> 00:33:48,240
 he's gone, wow, what an amazing life.

1040
00:33:48,240 --> 00:33:49,360
 What did you do?

1041
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:50,760
 Yeah, yes, spitfires as well.

1042
00:33:50,760 --> 00:33:52,880
 (laughing)

1043
00:33:52,880 --> 00:33:54,200
 - So anyway, the spitfire.

1044
00:33:54,200 --> 00:33:55,280
 - Spitfire is amazing.

1045
00:33:55,280 --> 00:33:56,880
 - So are you into the spitfire?

1046
00:33:56,880 --> 00:33:57,720
 - Yeah.

1047
00:33:57,720 --> 00:33:58,720
 - 'Cause I feel like I don't,

1048
00:33:58,720 --> 00:34:01,080
 I feel, how do I put this politely?

1049
00:34:01,080 --> 00:34:02,500
 - The people that talk about spitfires a lot

1050
00:34:02,500 --> 00:34:04,560
 tend to be a few years older than you.

1051
00:34:04,560 --> 00:34:05,560
 - Thank you.

1052
00:34:05,560 --> 00:34:06,640
 That's actually a compliment guys.

1053
00:34:06,640 --> 00:34:07,980
 I don't know if you heard that was,

1054
00:34:07,980 --> 00:34:09,260
 (laughing)

1055
00:34:09,260 --> 00:34:12,440
 I'm young seeming for a guy as interested in spitfires.

1056
00:34:12,440 --> 00:34:14,400
 (laughing)

1057
00:34:14,400 --> 00:34:17,280
 - Shit, my teacher at school when I was a kid,

1058
00:34:17,280 --> 00:34:19,800
 was an older guy, was really into spitfires.

1059
00:34:19,800 --> 00:34:21,960
 - I think actually, Ella, you'll find,

1060
00:34:21,960 --> 00:34:23,920
 the more that you meet Andy and talk to him.

1061
00:34:23,920 --> 00:34:24,760
 - He's an old man.

1062
00:34:24,760 --> 00:34:26,340
 - Well, a lot of the things he's interested in,

1063
00:34:26,340 --> 00:34:28,900
 you would expect older men to be interested in.

1064
00:34:28,900 --> 00:34:29,740
 - Is that fair to say?

1065
00:34:29,740 --> 00:34:31,100
 - I think it's not, I'm fair.

1066
00:34:31,100 --> 00:34:33,220
 (laughing)

1067
00:34:33,220 --> 00:34:35,820
 I'm not really, I'm not deeply into them,

1068
00:34:35,820 --> 00:34:37,940
 but I am interested in logistics.

1069
00:34:37,940 --> 00:34:40,300
 (laughing)

1070
00:34:40,300 --> 00:34:41,540
 - So for those who can't see this,

1071
00:34:41,540 --> 00:34:43,100
 he might be shaking a little bit.

1072
00:34:43,100 --> 00:34:44,020
 (laughing)

1073
00:34:44,020 --> 00:34:45,860
 I'm not really, really into it.

1074
00:34:45,860 --> 00:34:47,040
 - I'm trembling with joy.

1075
00:34:47,040 --> 00:34:47,880
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1076
00:34:47,880 --> 00:34:49,800
 I had a look at, just, you know,

1077
00:34:49,800 --> 00:34:51,660
 we check what we've talked about before in this podcast.

1078
00:34:51,660 --> 00:34:53,540
 I had a look, I can't believe you guys have stopped me

1079
00:34:53,540 --> 00:34:56,100
 for nine years from ever mentioning the spitfire

1080
00:34:56,100 --> 00:34:56,940
 on this show.

1081
00:34:56,940 --> 00:34:57,780
 We've never mentioned that.

1082
00:34:57,780 --> 00:34:58,620
 - Well done guys, high five for the rest of the day.

1083
00:34:58,620 --> 00:35:00,340
 (laughing)

1084
00:35:00,340 --> 00:35:01,180
 - Great place.

1085
00:35:01,180 --> 00:35:03,260
 - Yeah, incredible plane and also,

1086
00:35:03,260 --> 00:35:06,380
 what a group effort of the UK during wartime

1087
00:35:06,380 --> 00:35:08,340
 to make this plane built to the numbers

1088
00:35:08,340 --> 00:35:09,180
 that it was built at.

1089
00:35:09,180 --> 00:35:11,540
 Basically, there was, I was reading an article saying

1090
00:35:11,540 --> 00:35:14,580
 that it was effectively like one of the early kick starters

1091
00:35:14,580 --> 00:35:16,260
 where people funded,

1092
00:35:16,260 --> 00:35:19,020
 coal communities would go around funding single planes

1093
00:35:19,020 --> 00:35:21,340
 and they, as a result, got to name the plane.

1094
00:35:21,340 --> 00:35:23,740
 So lots of the planes flying that were in the war

1095
00:35:23,740 --> 00:35:26,620
 had names like Dorothy of Great Britain and Empire

1096
00:35:26,620 --> 00:35:29,540
 and that was funded entirely by women called Dorothy.

1097
00:35:29,540 --> 00:35:32,700
 So, it's so, yes, it's so funny.

1098
00:35:32,700 --> 00:35:33,540
 - Maria plane.

1099
00:35:33,540 --> 00:35:35,540
 - Yeah, by the fact that 70% of women

1100
00:35:35,540 --> 00:35:36,880
 were called Dorothy.

1101
00:35:36,880 --> 00:35:38,300
 (laughing)

1102
00:35:38,300 --> 00:35:41,180
 - There was the dog fighter as well.

1103
00:35:41,180 --> 00:35:43,260
 There was, and that was the Kennel Club

1104
00:35:43,260 --> 00:35:44,100
 who had funded that. - All right,

1105
00:35:44,100 --> 00:35:45,540
 it wasn't people who did dog fighting.

1106
00:35:45,540 --> 00:35:46,380
 (laughing)

1107
00:35:46,380 --> 00:35:48,460
 Think for the back of the pub.

1108
00:35:48,460 --> 00:35:51,100
 - But check this out, this is the most incredible one.

1109
00:35:51,100 --> 00:35:54,220
 There was one that was POWs of Oflag.

1110
00:35:54,220 --> 00:35:55,900
 This is a prison camp in Germany

1111
00:35:55,900 --> 00:35:59,180
 with captured officers who donated their month's pay

1112
00:35:59,180 --> 00:36:00,540
 through the Red Cross.

1113
00:36:00,540 --> 00:36:02,700
 Then that went into the building of a plane.

1114
00:36:02,700 --> 00:36:06,140
 So they were in prison and they were funding the plane.

1115
00:36:06,140 --> 00:36:07,380
 - That was war actually.

1116
00:36:07,380 --> 00:36:10,940
 - I read about that and they had to send letters back

1117
00:36:10,940 --> 00:36:14,860
 saying I want to give my money to this crowdfunding, right?

1118
00:36:14,860 --> 00:36:16,740
 But they had to do it in code.

1119
00:36:16,740 --> 00:36:18,860
 So, because you couldn't send a message

1120
00:36:18,860 --> 00:36:20,420
 that the Germans will be able to read saying,

1121
00:36:20,420 --> 00:36:22,420
 please put all my money into spitfires.

1122
00:36:22,420 --> 00:36:24,500
 Otherwise they're just gonna accidentally lose it, aren't they?

1123
00:36:24,500 --> 00:36:26,220
 - Yeah, exactly. - It's amazing.

1124
00:36:26,220 --> 00:36:27,860
 - It was, that was a really nice thing,

1125
00:36:27,860 --> 00:36:30,100
 this crowdfunding effort, which I had not heard of.

1126
00:36:30,100 --> 00:36:31,300
 - What would they have called it back then, though?

1127
00:36:31,300 --> 00:36:32,260
 It wouldn't have been crowdfunding.

1128
00:36:32,260 --> 00:36:34,540
 - They were called Spitfire Funds.

1129
00:36:34,540 --> 00:36:36,980
 And the planes were kind of arbitrarily priced.

1130
00:36:36,980 --> 00:36:38,780
 They said 5,000 pounds will buy a Spitfire,

1131
00:36:38,780 --> 00:36:40,140
 which was not actually a true figure,

1132
00:36:40,140 --> 00:36:41,940
 but it sort of was a peg for people too.

1133
00:36:41,940 --> 00:36:43,660
 - But also that thing of charities,

1134
00:36:43,660 --> 00:36:44,500
 these days they would say,

1135
00:36:44,500 --> 00:36:46,860
 two pounds will buy a meal for one person.

1136
00:36:46,860 --> 00:36:48,820
 - Yeah, it was like six pounds will buy a rivet.

1137
00:36:48,820 --> 00:36:49,900
 - Exactly. - And 2,000 pounds

1138
00:36:49,900 --> 00:36:50,740
 will get you a wing.

1139
00:36:50,740 --> 00:36:51,580
 - No.

1140
00:36:51,580 --> 00:36:53,060
 - So you can see what you were buying.

1141
00:36:53,060 --> 00:36:54,980
 - They raised a lot of money.

1142
00:36:54,980 --> 00:36:56,940
 It was nearly given a much less sexy name

1143
00:36:56,940 --> 00:36:57,780
 than the Spitfire.

1144
00:36:57,780 --> 00:36:59,740
 Spitfire's quite a swashbuckling name.

1145
00:36:59,740 --> 00:37:03,340
 Other contenders included Scarab, Shrike,

1146
00:37:03,340 --> 00:37:04,860
 which is quite good, 'cause that's a bird

1147
00:37:04,860 --> 00:37:07,740
 that impales its prey, and it's quite sort of...

1148
00:37:07,740 --> 00:37:10,380
 But I looked up the complete list of Super Marine aircraft,

1149
00:37:10,380 --> 00:37:12,540
 and there were some many bad options

1150
00:37:12,540 --> 00:37:14,260
 that the Spitfire could have been called.

1151
00:37:14,260 --> 00:37:16,860
 There was the Super Marine Commercial Amphibian,

1152
00:37:16,860 --> 00:37:18,780
 the Super Marine Sea Urchin,

1153
00:37:18,780 --> 00:37:20,980
 Super Marine Spiteful, quite good,

1154
00:37:20,980 --> 00:37:24,260
 the Super Marine Seagull, Super Marine Sea Otter.

1155
00:37:24,260 --> 00:37:25,940
 - No, no, no, they're taking the...

1156
00:37:25,940 --> 00:37:29,020
 - No, they're a rip, and the Super Marine Baby.

1157
00:37:29,020 --> 00:37:30,580
 - Oh, yeah. - Oh, yeah.

1158
00:37:30,580 --> 00:37:31,580
 - I know. - In a brainstorm,

1159
00:37:31,580 --> 00:37:33,220
 sometimes there are bad ideas.

1160
00:37:33,220 --> 00:37:35,780
 - Unleash the babies, yeah, yeah.

1161
00:37:35,780 --> 00:37:36,740
 But they mostly began with this,

1162
00:37:36,740 --> 00:37:38,100
 and they were mostly sea planes.

1163
00:37:38,100 --> 00:37:39,180
 That's what they started out as,

1164
00:37:39,180 --> 00:37:41,900
 the firm started out making sea planes and so, yeah.

1165
00:37:41,900 --> 00:37:44,620
 - I love sea planes. - Yeah, they're cool.

1166
00:37:44,620 --> 00:37:47,980
 - Imagine they're a plane where you can just land anywhere.

1167
00:37:47,980 --> 00:37:50,260
 As long as there's a body of water, you just land.

1168
00:37:50,260 --> 00:37:51,340
 - So not on land.

1169
00:37:51,340 --> 00:37:52,660
 - Yeah, well, yeah.

1170
00:37:52,660 --> 00:37:54,460
 - No, no, no, no, sorry.

1171
00:37:54,460 --> 00:37:55,780
 - I'm sorry.

1172
00:37:55,780 --> 00:37:57,380
 - Dan suddenly brings the facts.

1173
00:37:57,380 --> 00:37:59,900
 - You get special life jackets in case you land on land.

1174
00:37:59,900 --> 00:38:01,380
 - Yeah, yeah, exactly.

1175
00:38:01,380 --> 00:38:06,100
 - These Super Marine Spitfires,

1176
00:38:06,100 --> 00:38:08,060
 when they were taxiing,

1177
00:38:08,060 --> 00:38:10,900
 so just kind of driving around the airport,

1178
00:38:10,900 --> 00:38:12,780
 they were quite often sort of,

1179
00:38:12,780 --> 00:38:15,060
 not overturned, but get really wobbly.

1180
00:38:15,060 --> 00:38:17,220
 And so what would happen is someone would often sit

1181
00:38:17,220 --> 00:38:19,940
 on the tail of the plane to keep them steady,

1182
00:38:19,940 --> 00:38:21,740
 and it was often a woman who did this,

1183
00:38:21,740 --> 00:38:24,380
 and there was a particular woman called Margaret Horton

1184
00:38:24,380 --> 00:38:28,380
 who did this in 1943 at RAF, Heibaldstow,

1185
00:38:28,380 --> 00:38:29,980
 and she was sat on the back

1186
00:38:29,980 --> 00:38:32,380
 and the guy was a little bit anxious to get in the air

1187
00:38:32,380 --> 00:38:34,060
 and forgot to get her off the tail.

1188
00:38:34,060 --> 00:38:35,340
 - No, no, no.

1189
00:38:35,340 --> 00:38:36,940
 - So started taking off

1190
00:38:36,940 --> 00:38:39,820
 while she was sitting on the tail of the Spitfire.

1191
00:38:39,820 --> 00:38:43,900
 And he radioed down to traffic controls saying,

1192
00:38:43,900 --> 00:38:46,060
 there's something wrong with this plane.

1193
00:38:46,060 --> 00:38:48,300
 It's kind of really heavy.

1194
00:38:48,980 --> 00:38:50,820
 - And so they talked him down,

1195
00:38:50,820 --> 00:38:54,300
 but they never told him that there was a woman on the back.

1196
00:38:54,300 --> 00:38:55,420
 - Oh, no way.

1197
00:38:55,420 --> 00:38:57,220
 - Well, because as soon as they tell him,

1198
00:38:57,220 --> 00:38:58,060
 he's gonna be--

1199
00:38:58,060 --> 00:38:58,900
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1200
00:38:58,900 --> 00:38:59,740
 - So true.

1201
00:38:59,740 --> 00:39:01,620
 - So they're like, oh yeah, there's obviously a problem

1202
00:39:01,620 --> 00:39:04,060
 with the wing, we'll just talk you down on how to get down.

1203
00:39:04,060 --> 00:39:06,700
 And so he never knew until he landed that this woman was--

1204
00:39:06,700 --> 00:39:07,540
 - Bloody hell.

1205
00:39:07,540 --> 00:39:08,860
 - And she survived.

1206
00:39:08,860 --> 00:39:10,180
 - She survived, yeah, yeah.

1207
00:39:10,180 --> 00:39:11,020
 - She survived.

1208
00:39:11,020 --> 00:39:14,060
 There's a museum called Tagmeer Military Aviation Museum.

1209
00:39:14,060 --> 00:39:15,380
 And when you go to it,

1210
00:39:15,380 --> 00:39:16,780
 there's a model that they've made.

1211
00:39:16,780 --> 00:39:19,460
 So you can see a model of a Spitfire taking off

1212
00:39:19,460 --> 00:39:20,300
 with this woman.

1213
00:39:20,300 --> 00:39:22,300
 - A little plasticine woman

1214
00:39:22,300 --> 00:39:24,820
 or whatever the material is holding on the tail wing.

1215
00:39:24,820 --> 00:39:26,140
 - It's so funny.

1216
00:39:26,140 --> 00:39:27,460
 - It's so brilliant.

1217
00:39:27,460 --> 00:39:30,620
 - Should we say why it was so good?

1218
00:39:30,620 --> 00:39:32,140
 - I'm intrigued, yeah.

1219
00:39:32,140 --> 00:39:34,380
 So apparently all the pilots loved it,

1220
00:39:34,380 --> 00:39:36,660
 but I'm like, why, why did they all love it?

1221
00:39:36,660 --> 00:39:38,460
 - Well, it was really nimble.

1222
00:39:38,460 --> 00:39:40,260
 It turned very, very fast.

1223
00:39:40,260 --> 00:39:41,860
 And also the other thing about it was,

1224
00:39:41,860 --> 00:39:43,060
 it was, you know, it's like,

1225
00:39:43,060 --> 00:39:45,740
 if you guys want to tease me when I say this bit,

1226
00:39:45,740 --> 00:39:46,580
 I don't mind, right?

1227
00:39:46,580 --> 00:39:50,700
 But basically they had flush riveting, which is a good--

1228
00:39:50,700 --> 00:39:52,020
 (laughing)

1229
00:39:52,020 --> 00:39:54,780
 Okay, talk amongst yourselves.

1230
00:39:54,780 --> 00:39:56,220
 Dear listener.

1231
00:39:56,220 --> 00:39:59,460
 No, so metal skin, very, very cool.

1232
00:39:59,460 --> 00:40:01,260
 But if you had lumpy rivets all over it,

1233
00:40:01,260 --> 00:40:02,780
 which most planes did before that,

1234
00:40:02,780 --> 00:40:04,820
 it drags the plane back a bit.

1235
00:40:04,820 --> 00:40:07,340
 Whereas if you sink, you use the little countersunk rivets,

1236
00:40:07,340 --> 00:40:09,420
 so you can see where it's going to go.

1237
00:40:09,420 --> 00:40:10,860
 So it's like, what's going on?

1238
00:40:10,860 --> 00:40:12,740
 If you sink, you use the little countersunk rivets,

1239
00:40:12,740 --> 00:40:14,500
 so you sort of, it's exactly level

1240
00:40:14,500 --> 00:40:15,740
 with the surface of the plane,

1241
00:40:15,740 --> 00:40:17,620
 then the airflow is very efficient

1242
00:40:17,620 --> 00:40:19,180
 and you get a much faster plane.

1243
00:40:19,180 --> 00:40:21,380
 And they did some experiments on early spitfires.

1244
00:40:21,380 --> 00:40:22,740
 They replicated what it would be like

1245
00:40:22,740 --> 00:40:26,020
 if it had external rivets by gluing split peas

1246
00:40:26,020 --> 00:40:28,380
 onto the spots where the rivets were all over the plane

1247
00:40:28,380 --> 00:40:31,140
 and then flying it, doing a speed test, basically.

1248
00:40:31,140 --> 00:40:33,980
 And it was about 20, 22 miles an hour slower.

1249
00:40:33,980 --> 00:40:35,820
 It was a fair chunk slower,

1250
00:40:35,820 --> 00:40:37,340
 which would have had a serious effect

1251
00:40:37,340 --> 00:40:39,820
 if you were in a combat situation, you know.

1252
00:40:39,820 --> 00:40:40,660
 So yeah.

1253
00:40:40,660 --> 00:40:42,900
 - Couldn't you have stopped the enemy

1254
00:40:42,900 --> 00:40:45,580
 by going in and putting peas on his plane?

1255
00:40:45,580 --> 00:40:46,420
 - Definitely.

1256
00:40:46,420 --> 00:40:50,420
 That was a big part of the early SIS job was, yeah.

1257
00:40:50,420 --> 00:40:52,220
 - I used to do that and so did my wife.

1258
00:40:52,220 --> 00:40:53,300
 (laughing)

1259
00:40:53,300 --> 00:40:56,060
 - So that fact would be even more impressive

1260
00:40:56,060 --> 00:40:57,700
 if I knew what a rivet was.

1261
00:40:57,700 --> 00:40:59,820
 (hissing)

1262
00:40:59,820 --> 00:41:00,660
 - Yeah.

1263
00:41:00,660 --> 00:41:03,860
 Well, you've got to retain some mystery, I'm afraid.

1264
00:41:03,860 --> 00:41:06,060
 - That's still under the secrets act, actually.

1265
00:41:06,060 --> 00:41:07,500
 - What the hell's a rivet?

1266
00:41:07,500 --> 00:41:09,220
 - A kind of screw, kind of screw.

1267
00:41:09,220 --> 00:41:10,220
 - Like a big old screw.

1268
00:41:10,220 --> 00:41:11,940
 - It joins the bits of the plane

1269
00:41:11,940 --> 00:41:12,780
 to the other bits of the plane.

1270
00:41:12,780 --> 00:41:14,540
 - I'm googling rivet.

1271
00:41:14,540 --> 00:41:15,380
 - That's so funny.

1272
00:41:15,380 --> 00:41:16,740
 - You know the word riveting?

1273
00:41:16,740 --> 00:41:18,560
 It's got nothing to do with what a rivet is.

1274
00:41:18,560 --> 00:41:19,700
 (laughing)

1275
00:41:19,700 --> 00:41:20,780
 - Hold on, rivet.

1276
00:41:20,780 --> 00:41:21,620
 Just googling.

1277
00:41:21,620 --> 00:41:24,620
 - 'Cause it holds you together, it holds you in place.

1278
00:41:24,620 --> 00:41:25,780
 Yeah, you're right.

1279
00:41:25,780 --> 00:41:28,420
 - This is, yeah, they're just, it's a kind of screw.

1280
00:41:28,420 --> 00:41:30,100
 - Yeah, yeah, basically, yeah.

1281
00:41:30,100 --> 00:41:33,260
 - Message in if you didn't know what a rivet was.

1282
00:41:33,260 --> 00:41:35,420
 - And if you like, I can repeat that fact for you now.

1283
00:41:35,420 --> 00:41:38,020
 And it'll be even more exciting this time round.

1284
00:41:38,980 --> 00:41:40,180
 - Shouldn't be that, though.

1285
00:41:40,180 --> 00:41:41,720
 - Yeah, I'll just quickly mention.

1286
00:41:41,720 --> 00:41:42,560
 - What?

1287
00:41:42,560 --> 00:41:43,380
 (laughing)

1288
00:41:43,380 --> 00:41:44,460
 - I feel like we've got it now.

1289
00:41:44,460 --> 00:41:46,380
 I've read a tenth of my stuff out.

1290
00:41:46,380 --> 00:41:48,860
 I haven't told you about the Super Marine Walrus.

1291
00:41:48,860 --> 00:41:50,020
 - So it's just not of interest.

1292
00:41:50,020 --> 00:41:52,020
 Like, what are your subjects that they won't let you

1293
00:41:52,020 --> 00:41:52,860
 normally talk about?

1294
00:41:52,860 --> 00:41:55,700
 I just need to know, like, how valid.

1295
00:41:55,700 --> 00:41:57,220
 - It's mostly second-world war logistic.

1296
00:41:57,220 --> 00:41:59,460
 - Yeah, we end up letting him do it

1297
00:41:59,460 --> 00:42:02,140
 because he does crowbar it in somehow into any old fact.

1298
00:42:02,140 --> 00:42:03,340
 - So it is a question for you.

1299
00:42:03,340 --> 00:42:07,700
 Do you follow current war strategy and logistics?

1300
00:42:07,700 --> 00:42:09,500
 Like, I've got a whole bunch of male friends

1301
00:42:09,500 --> 00:42:12,460
 who are so into the logistics of the Ukrainian war

1302
00:42:12,460 --> 00:42:15,700
 that it's gone beyond anything that I think is normal.

1303
00:42:15,700 --> 00:42:18,540
 - You'd have to ask my wife what's normal

1304
00:42:18,540 --> 00:42:21,460
 in terms of what--

1305
00:42:21,460 --> 00:42:23,100
 - It's past and present.

1306
00:42:23,100 --> 00:42:25,140
 - I think logistics is interesting.

1307
00:42:25,140 --> 00:42:27,380
 (laughing)

1308
00:42:27,380 --> 00:42:32,020
 And I'm not, I'm blushing now, but actually,

1309
00:42:32,020 --> 00:42:32,860
 I'm not ashamed.

1310
00:42:32,860 --> 00:42:35,500
 - Logistics is interesting, needs to go on your tombstone.

1311
00:42:35,500 --> 00:42:38,860
 - We can't all be, we can't all be bloody explorers, you know,

1312
00:42:38,860 --> 00:42:40,500
 on cool cement ships.

1313
00:42:40,500 --> 00:42:41,820
 I'm gonna stay on the cement ship.

1314
00:42:41,820 --> 00:42:43,060
 Thank you, I don't wanna see Sokotra.

1315
00:42:43,060 --> 00:42:45,140
 - Look at the rivets on Andy's tombstone.

1316
00:42:45,140 --> 00:42:47,580
 (laughing)

1317
00:42:47,580 --> 00:42:48,900
 - Oh, dear.

1318
00:42:48,900 --> 00:42:52,340
 - We've been so mean.

1319
00:42:52,340 --> 00:42:53,180
 - No, no.

1320
00:42:53,180 --> 00:42:54,620
 - Look, some people need to be in logistics.

1321
00:42:54,620 --> 00:42:55,460
 Just--

1322
00:42:55,460 --> 00:42:56,300
 - Well, actually, James is right.

1323
00:42:56,300 --> 00:42:58,700
 We're not actually out of time, but we should move on.

1324
00:42:58,700 --> 00:43:00,020
 - Oh, can I tell you, can I tell you one more?

1325
00:43:00,020 --> 00:43:02,220
 Like, sort of, Spitfire here,

1326
00:43:02,220 --> 00:43:04,380
 he actually wrote a book partly about the Spitfire.

1327
00:43:04,380 --> 00:43:05,300
 Douglas Bader?

1328
00:43:05,300 --> 00:43:06,140
 - Yeah.

1329
00:43:06,140 --> 00:43:06,960
 - Yeah, yeah.

1330
00:43:06,960 --> 00:43:08,060
 - He was a really famous pilot,

1331
00:43:08,060 --> 00:43:09,860
 partly because I think it was in,

1332
00:43:09,860 --> 00:43:10,700
 I don't know if it was an accident.

1333
00:43:10,700 --> 00:43:11,900
 - But he famously had no legs.

1334
00:43:11,900 --> 00:43:12,740
 - He had no legs.

1335
00:43:12,740 --> 00:43:13,940
 But he nonetheless--

1336
00:43:13,940 --> 00:43:15,900
 - He almost lost his legs during mission flight.

1337
00:43:15,900 --> 00:43:18,060
 - Yeah, flying accident, yeah, yeah, flying incidents.

1338
00:43:18,060 --> 00:43:20,300
 And he became a Spitfire ace nonetheless.

1339
00:43:20,300 --> 00:43:22,460
 In the Second World War, he was shot down over France,

1340
00:43:22,460 --> 00:43:24,640
 and he ejected, so he survived,

1341
00:43:24,640 --> 00:43:26,340
 but he lost one of his prosthetic legs

1342
00:43:26,340 --> 00:43:28,620
 in the course of being shot down.

1343
00:43:28,620 --> 00:43:30,580
 Well, no, he was treated with a lot of respect

1344
00:43:30,580 --> 00:43:32,260
 by the Germans who captured him,

1345
00:43:32,260 --> 00:43:34,100
 because there were rules about that.

1346
00:43:34,100 --> 00:43:35,880
 And he was in a prisoner of war camp.

1347
00:43:35,880 --> 00:43:38,100
 And Göring, who was the head of the Luftwaffe,

1348
00:43:38,100 --> 00:43:41,620
 gave special permission for an artificial leg,

1349
00:43:41,620 --> 00:43:45,100
 a spare leg to be parachuted into his prisoner of war camp.

1350
00:43:45,100 --> 00:43:45,940
 - Amazing.

1351
00:43:45,940 --> 00:43:46,780
 - Yeah.

1352
00:43:46,780 --> 00:43:47,620
 - I think what happened was, though,

1353
00:43:47,620 --> 00:43:49,100
 he kept trying to escape,

1354
00:43:49,100 --> 00:43:51,980
 and so they confiscated his prosthetic in the end.

1355
00:43:51,980 --> 00:43:53,380
 - Yes, they did, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1356
00:43:53,380 --> 00:43:55,500
 That was before the relationship started, I guess.

1357
00:43:55,500 --> 00:43:56,340
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1358
00:43:56,340 --> 00:43:57,980
 And that was called Operation Leg.

1359
00:43:57,980 --> 00:43:58,820
 - Nice.

1360
00:43:58,820 --> 00:44:00,260
 - Where do they come up with their legs?

1361
00:44:00,260 --> 00:44:02,940
 (all laughing)

1362
00:44:02,940 --> 00:44:04,500
 - There's one other hero we should mention,

1363
00:44:04,500 --> 00:44:06,020
 which is Lady Houston.

1364
00:44:06,020 --> 00:44:07,700
 Lady Houston's sort of the reason

1365
00:44:07,700 --> 00:44:11,420
 that the Spitfire became the Spitfire during the war.

1366
00:44:11,420 --> 00:44:14,100
 She was a suffrager, political activist.

1367
00:44:14,100 --> 00:44:17,020
 She also was one of the richest women in the UK,

1368
00:44:17,020 --> 00:44:18,900
 if not the richest at one point.

1369
00:44:18,900 --> 00:44:22,100
 And she was someone who kept helping out with war efforts.

1370
00:44:22,100 --> 00:44:23,420
 She was always donating things.

1371
00:44:23,420 --> 00:44:26,940
 - I think the war people didn't like her very much, right?

1372
00:44:26,940 --> 00:44:27,780
 - That's right.

1373
00:44:27,780 --> 00:44:30,300
 - Because she kept saying that they weren't giving

1374
00:44:30,300 --> 00:44:32,260
 enough money to the war effort.

1375
00:44:32,260 --> 00:44:33,700
 They weren't giving enough equipment,

1376
00:44:33,700 --> 00:44:34,740
 all that kind of stuff.

1377
00:44:34,740 --> 00:44:36,700
 And she would go around with placards saying,

1378
00:44:36,700 --> 00:44:38,380
 "Give them more guns," kind of thing.

1379
00:44:38,380 --> 00:44:39,460
 And they got really annoyed.

1380
00:44:39,460 --> 00:44:42,260
 But she did get a lot of money together.

1381
00:44:42,260 --> 00:44:44,420
 And I think, are you gonna say that she helped

1382
00:44:44,420 --> 00:44:46,540
 to pay for the design of the Spitfire?

1383
00:44:46,540 --> 00:44:47,660
 - Yeah, basically what it was,

1384
00:44:47,660 --> 00:44:49,260
 was there was a thing called the Snyder Trophy,

1385
00:44:49,260 --> 00:44:52,380
 which was a biannual international airspeed race.

1386
00:44:52,380 --> 00:44:54,260
 And Britain won it twice.

1387
00:44:54,260 --> 00:44:56,060
 And the idea was if they won the third one,

1388
00:44:56,060 --> 00:44:57,820
 they would get to keep the trophy for good.

1389
00:44:57,820 --> 00:44:59,020
 But at this point, the government said,

1390
00:44:59,020 --> 00:45:00,460
 "We're not gonna fund this stuff.

1391
00:45:00,460 --> 00:45:01,780
 "We need all the money."

1392
00:45:01,780 --> 00:45:03,180
 And she thought that was a huge mistake.

1393
00:45:03,180 --> 00:45:04,460
 - It was seen as a bit of a like,

1394
00:45:04,460 --> 00:45:06,660
 "This is a crazy wonder weapon idea.

1395
00:45:06,660 --> 00:45:09,060
 "It's not gonna, like this is a mad waste of money."

1396
00:45:09,060 --> 00:45:10,300
 - It was in a depression.

1397
00:45:10,300 --> 00:45:11,140
 It was, yeah.

1398
00:45:11,140 --> 00:45:13,300
 - This was in like late 20s, early 30s.

1399
00:45:13,300 --> 00:45:14,540
 This was before.

1400
00:45:14,540 --> 00:45:15,380
 - Exactly.

1401
00:45:15,380 --> 00:45:18,060
 And so she said, "Well, no, that shouldn't be the case."

1402
00:45:18,060 --> 00:45:19,020
 So she funded it.

1403
00:45:19,020 --> 00:45:21,020
 She funded it for it to go ahead.

1404
00:45:21,020 --> 00:45:23,820
 And as a result, Rolls-Royce developed a new engine

1405
00:45:23,820 --> 00:45:25,740
 that became Spitfire's engine and so on.

1406
00:45:25,740 --> 00:45:28,940
 So it was down to her and making that happen.

1407
00:45:28,940 --> 00:45:31,900
 She was the wizened old Texan of her day.

1408
00:45:31,900 --> 00:45:33,020
 - Yeah, she was.

1409
00:45:33,020 --> 00:45:33,860
 - Exactly.

1410
00:45:33,860 --> 00:45:36,060
 - They're wonderful.

1411
00:45:36,060 --> 00:45:37,860
 Let me tell you, if you've got some money,

1412
00:45:37,860 --> 00:45:38,980
 lose some of it with me.

1413
00:45:38,980 --> 00:45:39,820
 It's fine.

1414
00:45:39,820 --> 00:45:42,460
 - We also have a Patreon just to say.

1415
00:45:42,460 --> 00:45:44,820
 - Dammit.

1416
00:45:44,820 --> 00:45:53,020
 - Okay, it's time for our final fact of the show.

1417
00:45:53,020 --> 00:45:54,220
 And that is my fact.

1418
00:45:54,220 --> 00:45:57,700
 My fact this week is that one of the original names proposed

1419
00:45:57,700 --> 00:46:01,700
 for what we now know as Neanderthals was Homo Stupidus.

1420
00:46:01,700 --> 00:46:05,380
 - Brilliant.

1421
00:46:05,380 --> 00:46:07,340
 - Yeah, so this was in the early days

1422
00:46:07,340 --> 00:46:10,380
 when we were finding skulls of what was then thought like,

1423
00:46:10,380 --> 00:46:11,300
 is this a bear?

1424
00:46:11,300 --> 00:46:14,580
 Is this a sort of just like, no one knew what it's a plane.

1425
00:46:14,580 --> 00:46:18,180
 There was a point where we were finding lots of skulls

1426
00:46:18,180 --> 00:46:20,020
 and we didn't quite know what this thing was.

1427
00:46:20,020 --> 00:46:22,500
 It would later turn out to be Neanderthals.

1428
00:46:22,500 --> 00:46:25,420
 And when they got to a point where they were thinking,

1429
00:46:25,420 --> 00:46:27,900
 "Okay, actually we do have a new different species

1430
00:46:27,900 --> 00:46:29,940
 of Homo here, we need to give it a name."

1431
00:46:29,940 --> 00:46:31,980
 But by the look of it and by the skeletons that have been

1432
00:46:31,980 --> 00:46:35,060
 found, it looked like a very clumsy, bulky idiot.

1433
00:46:35,060 --> 00:46:39,860
 And so a very famous scientist at the time, Ernest Haeckel,

1434
00:46:39,860 --> 00:46:42,460
 suggested, why not call it Homo Stupidus,

1435
00:46:42,460 --> 00:46:46,220
 to really dig home that this is why this moron

1436
00:46:46,220 --> 00:46:48,420
 is no longer existing on our planet.

1437
00:46:48,420 --> 00:46:50,580
 Now we now know that this is completely wrong,

1438
00:46:50,580 --> 00:46:53,100
 that Neanderthals were actually very intelligent.

1439
00:46:53,100 --> 00:46:56,260
 They did art, they could sing, perhaps.

1440
00:46:56,260 --> 00:46:57,540
 There's lots of things that we're discovering

1441
00:46:57,540 --> 00:46:58,380
 more and more about them.

1442
00:46:58,380 --> 00:47:02,140
 They used penicillin even, like a whole version of penicillin.

1443
00:47:02,140 --> 00:47:03,460
 - I mean, prehistoric version.

1444
00:47:03,460 --> 00:47:04,780
 - Prehistoric, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1445
00:47:04,780 --> 00:47:05,620
 - Not over the counter stuff.

1446
00:47:05,620 --> 00:47:06,460
 - Sure.

1447
00:47:06,460 --> 00:47:07,300
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1448
00:47:07,300 --> 00:47:09,260
 But you're a Neanderthal expert, Ella.

1449
00:47:09,260 --> 00:47:11,060
 - So I have a number of questions.

1450
00:47:11,060 --> 00:47:12,060
 One is...

1451
00:47:12,060 --> 00:47:13,820
 - I feel we're doing this the wrong way around.

1452
00:47:13,820 --> 00:47:15,540
 (all laughing)

1453
00:47:15,540 --> 00:47:17,460
 - No, this is definitely targeted at you three.

1454
00:47:17,460 --> 00:47:19,180
 So when you have the guest on,

1455
00:47:19,180 --> 00:47:21,620
 are the topics always consistently the topics

1456
00:47:21,620 --> 00:47:22,900
 that they are specialists in?

1457
00:47:22,900 --> 00:47:24,700
 And if so, why did I get a spitfire?

1458
00:47:24,700 --> 00:47:26,300
 (all laughing)

1459
00:47:26,300 --> 00:47:28,740
 - I think we try, we try a bit of inside baseball.

1460
00:47:28,740 --> 00:47:31,180
 We try to do things that our guests

1461
00:47:31,180 --> 00:47:32,260
 are going to know a lot about.

1462
00:47:32,260 --> 00:47:33,740
 - Yeah, on your Wikipedia page,

1463
00:47:33,740 --> 00:47:35,300
 it says you're an expert in rivets.

1464
00:47:35,300 --> 00:47:36,740
 (all laughing)

1465
00:47:36,740 --> 00:47:38,380
 - Please nobody edit it.

1466
00:47:38,380 --> 00:47:41,740
 There's already a whole bunch of untruths on that page.

1467
00:47:41,740 --> 00:47:44,340
 - But sometimes a little fact about maybe logistics

1468
00:47:44,340 --> 00:47:46,940
 or military strategy will just slip through that.

1469
00:47:46,940 --> 00:47:48,940
 - I wish this was being filmed 'cause you're Facebook.

1470
00:47:48,940 --> 00:47:51,220
 (all laughing)

1471
00:47:51,220 --> 00:47:54,580
 - Yeah, no, the thing with...

1472
00:47:54,580 --> 00:47:59,300
 So taxonomy is the system of naming things in biology.

1473
00:47:59,300 --> 00:48:02,700
 And there's this rule called, it's an a priori thing.

1474
00:48:02,700 --> 00:48:07,700
 And what it means is that if we find a fossil today

1475
00:48:07,700 --> 00:48:10,220
 and we call it something,

1476
00:48:10,220 --> 00:48:13,060
 that is the name it is given if it becomes a species.

1477
00:48:13,060 --> 00:48:15,380
 So if I find a fossil today and I go,

1478
00:48:15,380 --> 00:48:17,100
 oh, it might be homo sapien,

1479
00:48:17,100 --> 00:48:20,100
 or it might be homo shriver.

1480
00:48:20,100 --> 00:48:23,060
 - Okay, we already had a hop of stupidness.

1481
00:48:23,060 --> 00:48:25,260
 (all laughing)

1482
00:48:25,260 --> 00:48:28,220
 - Then let's say there's this, but I publish it.

1483
00:48:28,220 --> 00:48:31,540
 So if I publish it in any journal,

1484
00:48:31,540 --> 00:48:34,580
 then later on, if people are still like,

1485
00:48:34,580 --> 00:48:36,900
 no, no, no, we don't think that's a separate species.

1486
00:48:36,900 --> 00:48:39,260
 If suddenly two more of them are found

1487
00:48:39,260 --> 00:48:41,340
 that really do look similar.

1488
00:48:41,340 --> 00:48:42,460
 And somebody goes, no, actually,

1489
00:48:42,460 --> 00:48:46,420
 we really do think that now needs to be a species.

1490
00:48:46,420 --> 00:48:50,260
 They can't go, well, we want to call it homo, whatever.

1491
00:48:50,260 --> 00:48:52,900
 No, no, the a priori rule is very clear.

1492
00:48:52,900 --> 00:48:54,180
 It has to be called that.

1493
00:48:54,180 --> 00:48:57,660
 So luckily, homo neanderthalensis must have got in there earlier

1494
00:48:57,660 --> 00:49:00,260
 'cause otherwise we would be stuck with that bloody name.

1495
00:49:00,260 --> 00:49:01,340
 - Yeah, it was proposed.

1496
00:49:01,340 --> 00:49:03,060
 It was never seriously taken to a board.

1497
00:49:03,060 --> 00:49:04,780
 It was a guy called Dr. William King,

1498
00:49:04,780 --> 00:49:08,100
 who was an Irish geologist who eventually was the one

1499
00:49:08,100 --> 00:49:09,620
 who said, let's call it neanderthal

1500
00:49:09,620 --> 00:49:12,820
 because it was found, the particular one they were looking at,

1501
00:49:12,820 --> 00:49:15,140
 found in 1856 at the Neander River Valley.

1502
00:49:15,140 --> 00:49:17,260
 So it was named after the area.

1503
00:49:17,260 --> 00:49:19,420
 - And Thal is a valley, isn't it?

1504
00:49:19,420 --> 00:49:20,260
 I don't know that.

1505
00:49:20,260 --> 00:49:21,100
 - Oh, I don't know that.

1506
00:49:21,100 --> 00:49:23,060
 - It was in the Neander Valley.

1507
00:49:23,060 --> 00:49:24,140
 It was in the Neander Valley.

1508
00:49:24,140 --> 00:49:25,540
 - Wow. - Yeah, that's all.

1509
00:49:25,540 --> 00:49:30,060
 - So the homo neanderthalensis is what we call it now.

1510
00:49:30,060 --> 00:49:33,260
 But some people call it homo sapiens neanderthalensis

1511
00:49:33,260 --> 00:49:36,100
 because it might be a subspecies of homo sapien.

1512
00:49:36,100 --> 00:49:39,500
 If it was called homo sapien stupidas,

1513
00:49:39,500 --> 00:49:42,540
 then that would literally be stupid wise man.

1514
00:49:42,540 --> 00:49:43,380
 - Oh yeah.

1515
00:49:43,380 --> 00:49:46,780
 - Because sapiens means wise and that would have been quieter.

1516
00:49:46,780 --> 00:49:49,500
 - Yeah, I don't actually know how sapiens was picked

1517
00:49:49,500 --> 00:49:50,820
 'cause it does feel like we've given ourselves

1518
00:49:50,820 --> 00:49:53,020
 the nice end of the violence, you know.

1519
00:49:53,020 --> 00:49:55,940
 - Yeah, we're great, but I'm just saying it's a bit--

1520
00:49:55,940 --> 00:49:59,380
 - With the naming committee, of course we're gonna.

1521
00:49:59,380 --> 00:50:02,540
 - Some people said once that the brain is the only thing

1522
00:50:02,540 --> 00:50:05,660
 that named itself, which I think is nice.

1523
00:50:05,660 --> 00:50:07,820
 So brain must be a really good word for it.

1524
00:50:07,820 --> 00:50:10,020
 - Yeah, it's actually a rubbish word, isn't it?

1525
00:50:10,020 --> 00:50:11,740
 - Yeah, I think your brain would have come up

1526
00:50:11,740 --> 00:50:12,900
 with something better than that.

1527
00:50:12,900 --> 00:50:14,180
 - Yeah. - Idiot.

1528
00:50:14,180 --> 00:50:15,860
 - One of the names that the neanderthal could have had

1529
00:50:15,860 --> 00:50:18,460
 was Gibraltar man, homo gibraltaris or whatever,

1530
00:50:18,460 --> 00:50:20,740
 because the first, I think the first skulls

1531
00:50:20,740 --> 00:50:23,060
 were found in Gibraltar, but they were found too early.

1532
00:50:23,060 --> 00:50:25,100
 And they were found by I think a soldier

1533
00:50:25,100 --> 00:50:28,060
 and he was a soldier and geologist and he said,

1534
00:50:28,060 --> 00:50:29,580
 I think this might be something new,

1535
00:50:29,580 --> 00:50:32,020
 but he didn't really get anywhere, you know.

1536
00:50:32,020 --> 00:50:32,940
 - Yeah, I think there was a few

1537
00:50:32,940 --> 00:50:34,500
 that were found technically before,

1538
00:50:34,500 --> 00:50:35,620
 but they just didn't identify that.

1539
00:50:35,620 --> 00:50:37,900
 I think there was one in, I think the spi one as well,

1540
00:50:37,900 --> 00:50:40,700
 which is Belgium, I think that's also an early one,

1541
00:50:40,700 --> 00:50:42,300
 where they just didn't--

1542
00:50:42,300 --> 00:50:44,540
 - Oh, Flint, sorry, Flint was his name, Edmund Flint,

1543
00:50:44,540 --> 00:50:46,140
 which is a nice sort of prehistoric sounding name,

1544
00:50:46,140 --> 00:50:46,980
 or you know, like that.

1545
00:50:46,980 --> 00:50:48,340
 - He sounds like he's from Flintstones.

1546
00:50:48,340 --> 00:50:50,300
 - Yeah, he does, and he found it,

1547
00:50:50,300 --> 00:50:51,340
 but again, he didn't get anywhere.

1548
00:50:51,340 --> 00:50:53,220
 And actually, I think the last neanderthals

1549
00:50:53,220 --> 00:50:54,220
 also lived in Gibraltar.

1550
00:50:54,220 --> 00:50:56,980
 - Well, that's, I disagree with that.

1551
00:50:56,980 --> 00:50:58,060
 - Ooh, go on.

1552
00:50:58,060 --> 00:51:00,740
 - No, I think the team out there really believed that,

1553
00:51:00,740 --> 00:51:03,380
 but I don't think most of the rest of us believe that.

1554
00:51:03,380 --> 00:51:04,660
 I think we think it's a tosser.

1555
00:51:04,660 --> 00:51:07,220
 They might have been the Iberian Peninsula, but I just, yeah.

1556
00:51:07,220 --> 00:51:08,500
 - Was it somewhere islandy,

1557
00:51:08,500 --> 00:51:10,100
 where things kind of cling on a bit?

1558
00:51:10,100 --> 00:51:11,420
 - It was probably just the south,

1559
00:51:11,420 --> 00:51:13,260
 but also we just don't know, actually.

1560
00:51:13,260 --> 00:51:15,100
 The dates are consciously shifting.

1561
00:51:15,100 --> 00:51:16,380
 When I say that, I mean that

1562
00:51:16,380 --> 00:51:19,420
 when the scientists are dating them,

1563
00:51:19,420 --> 00:51:21,540
 they're realizing that all the dates we thought we had

1564
00:51:21,540 --> 00:51:24,860
 are kind of not as great, shall we say?

1565
00:51:24,860 --> 00:51:26,660
 There's many question marks about these dates.

1566
00:51:26,660 --> 00:51:29,700
 - I was reading about a neanderthal site in Croatia

1567
00:51:29,700 --> 00:51:31,140
 called Krapina Cave.

1568
00:51:31,140 --> 00:51:31,980
 - Yeah.

1569
00:51:31,980 --> 00:51:35,820
 - And what I found is that they found copper lights in there.

1570
00:51:35,820 --> 00:51:37,980
 So that suggests that the neanderthals

1571
00:51:37,980 --> 00:51:39,780
 might have actually crept in a cave.

1572
00:51:39,780 --> 00:51:40,620
 - Do you know what?

1573
00:51:40,620 --> 00:51:41,460
 - Do you know what?

1574
00:51:41,460 --> 00:51:44,260
 It would take you lot for me to realize that Krapina,

1575
00:51:44,260 --> 00:51:46,500
 which is an integral part of my research,

1576
00:51:46,500 --> 00:51:47,660
 (laughing)

1577
00:51:47,660 --> 00:51:49,220
 is actually crabby.

1578
00:51:49,220 --> 00:51:50,500
 (laughing)

1579
00:51:50,500 --> 00:51:53,700
 I had never in all my years realized that before.

1580
00:51:53,700 --> 00:51:54,540
 - That's so good.

1581
00:51:54,540 --> 00:51:55,380
 - Thank you.

1582
00:51:55,380 --> 00:51:56,220
 - You're very welcome.

1583
00:51:56,220 --> 00:51:57,060
 - Don't really appreciate it.

1584
00:51:57,060 --> 00:51:57,900
 No, I'm not gonna high five you.

1585
00:51:57,900 --> 00:52:00,500
 - Sometimes it takes a fool to teach a wise woman.

1586
00:52:00,500 --> 00:52:01,340
 - That's stupid.

1587
00:52:01,340 --> 00:52:04,220
 (laughing)

1588
00:52:04,220 --> 00:52:06,620
 - Ella, do you know whether or not

1589
00:52:06,620 --> 00:52:08,940
 you're a bit neanderthal?

1590
00:52:08,940 --> 00:52:10,180
 - Yeah, yeah, I got tested.

1591
00:52:10,180 --> 00:52:11,020
 - Yeah.

1592
00:52:11,020 --> 00:52:11,840
 - What's your, what's your number?

1593
00:52:11,840 --> 00:52:12,680
 - I don't know.

1594
00:52:12,680 --> 00:52:13,520
 I can't remember.

1595
00:52:13,520 --> 00:52:14,360
 - You can't remember?

1596
00:52:14,360 --> 00:52:15,200
 - I can't remember.

1597
00:52:15,200 --> 00:52:16,020
 - You study neanderthals and you can even be--

1598
00:52:16,020 --> 00:52:16,860
 - I can't remember.

1599
00:52:16,860 --> 00:52:17,700
 Retaining it.

1600
00:52:17,700 --> 00:52:20,180
 It was average-ish as far as I can remember.

1601
00:52:20,180 --> 00:52:21,020
 - Is that what I want?

1602
00:52:21,020 --> 00:52:21,860
 - 2% is average, yeah.

1603
00:52:21,860 --> 00:52:22,900
 - 2%, and you can do that.

1604
00:52:22,900 --> 00:52:24,580
 So the National Geographic Society,

1605
00:52:24,580 --> 00:52:26,540
 they have a geographic project

1606
00:52:26,540 --> 00:52:28,740
 where you do a swab in your mouth and you send it in

1607
00:52:28,740 --> 00:52:29,980
 and then they can give you the results

1608
00:52:29,980 --> 00:52:30,820
 and tell you whether you're not.

1609
00:52:30,820 --> 00:52:32,460
 And then I think we've, you know,

1610
00:52:32,460 --> 00:52:35,380
 we know Ozzy Osbourne is a bit neanderthal.

1611
00:52:35,380 --> 00:52:37,020
 - I mean, we mostly are.

1612
00:52:37,020 --> 00:52:39,860
 - Is it, everyone outside Africa is a couple of percent

1613
00:52:39,860 --> 00:52:43,820
 and that because early humans left Africa,

1614
00:52:43,820 --> 00:52:45,100
 bred with neanderthals,

1615
00:52:45,100 --> 00:52:48,900
 those populations spread to like Europe, Asia.

1616
00:52:48,900 --> 00:52:51,340
 But then, so is it called ghost DNA?

1617
00:52:51,340 --> 00:52:52,180
 I love this.

1618
00:52:52,180 --> 00:52:53,020
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1619
00:52:53,020 --> 00:52:55,740
 - Even people in Africa these days have kind of

1620
00:52:55,740 --> 00:52:57,740
 a small fraction of a percent of neanderthal DNA.

1621
00:52:57,740 --> 00:52:59,740
 - Well, so there's a few things going on there.

1622
00:52:59,740 --> 00:53:01,620
 One is that, yes, it's,

1623
00:53:01,620 --> 00:53:03,700
 so everybody outside of sub-Saharan Africa.

1624
00:53:03,700 --> 00:53:05,260
 So like the Tennesseans have got some,

1625
00:53:05,260 --> 00:53:06,700
 you know, the Egyptians have got some.

1626
00:53:06,700 --> 00:53:08,860
 And what it is is neanderthals were more European,

1627
00:53:08,860 --> 00:53:10,780
 Asian species and never went into Africa.

1628
00:53:10,780 --> 00:53:13,660
 So it was, that's why sub-Saharan don't really have it.

1629
00:53:13,660 --> 00:53:16,540
 The ghost DNA, so this is really cool.

1630
00:53:16,540 --> 00:53:20,100
 So now ancient DNA is so fascinating

1631
00:53:20,100 --> 00:53:21,700
 that they have been able to identify

1632
00:53:21,700 --> 00:53:23,180
 that there are other species out there

1633
00:53:23,180 --> 00:53:25,620
 called Homo God knows what,

1634
00:53:25,620 --> 00:53:28,860
 but they just don't have a single fossil for it.

1635
00:53:28,860 --> 00:53:30,740
 They don't know anything about this,

1636
00:53:30,740 --> 00:53:34,700
 but they know based on looking at all of our DNA globally,

1637
00:53:34,700 --> 00:53:37,100
 there were other species that we interbred with.

1638
00:53:37,100 --> 00:53:38,220
 And we just don't know.

1639
00:53:38,220 --> 00:53:39,860
 So we know that we interbred with neanderthals.

1640
00:53:39,860 --> 00:53:42,900
 We know that we interbred with a species called Denisiva.

1641
00:53:42,900 --> 00:53:45,180
 And then yeah, in the process of doing all this,

1642
00:53:45,180 --> 00:53:47,500
 they've also come across a few ghost lineages.

1643
00:53:47,500 --> 00:53:49,420
 And they're like, how do you marry it up

1644
00:53:49,420 --> 00:53:50,580
 with the fossils that are out there?

1645
00:53:50,580 --> 00:53:52,300
 'Cause you're like, I don't know what it looks like.

1646
00:53:52,300 --> 00:53:55,340
 - So can we, do we not name it until we find a fossil?

1647
00:53:55,340 --> 00:53:57,540
 - So in genetics, if it's a ghost lineage,

1648
00:53:57,540 --> 00:53:59,820
 they tend to like give it like population Y

1649
00:53:59,820 --> 00:54:01,860
 or population X or that kind of thing.

1650
00:54:01,860 --> 00:54:03,980
 They don't give it a name because they really don't know.

1651
00:54:03,980 --> 00:54:07,300
 - You've got to give it a cooler name than that, you know?

1652
00:54:07,300 --> 00:54:08,420
 - With that, yeah, that's the whole point.

1653
00:54:08,420 --> 00:54:10,180
 It's a standby name, isn't it?

1654
00:54:10,180 --> 00:54:11,020
 - Oh yeah, I see.

1655
00:54:11,020 --> 00:54:13,140
 And then they'll come up with a really cool name first.

1656
00:54:13,140 --> 00:54:14,540
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah, you're right.

1657
00:54:14,540 --> 00:54:16,740
 - But like imagine if like, so you've got Homo naledi,

1658
00:54:16,740 --> 00:54:20,220
 which is a new species that they discovered in South Africa.

1659
00:54:20,220 --> 00:54:23,220
 And that might be the ghost lineage,

1660
00:54:23,220 --> 00:54:24,420
 but that might be one of them.

1661
00:54:24,420 --> 00:54:25,740
 But we just, we don't know.

1662
00:54:25,740 --> 00:54:27,980
 'Cause until we've got DNA, we can't compare the two.

1663
00:54:27,980 --> 00:54:29,620
 - A DNA from a fossil.

1664
00:54:29,620 --> 00:54:30,700
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1665
00:54:30,700 --> 00:54:32,620
 You need the DNA.

1666
00:54:32,620 --> 00:54:34,940
 You need DNA from the fossils you've got

1667
00:54:34,940 --> 00:54:36,660
 to be able to compare it to this ghost lineage.

1668
00:54:36,660 --> 00:54:38,820
 - So it might be from Homo naledi.

1669
00:54:38,820 --> 00:54:39,660
 - It might be naledi, it might be naledi.

1670
00:54:39,660 --> 00:54:41,340
 We just don't know.

1671
00:54:41,340 --> 00:54:42,180
 It's so cool.

1672
00:54:42,180 --> 00:54:43,020
 - It's cool.

1673
00:54:43,020 --> 00:54:44,340
 - So the guy that found naledi, Lee Berger,

1674
00:54:44,340 --> 00:54:45,660
 is like, I reckon it is.

1675
00:54:45,660 --> 00:54:47,380
 But we were like, maybe.

1676
00:54:47,380 --> 00:54:48,660
 We don't know though.

1677
00:54:48,660 --> 00:54:49,500
 - Yeah.

1678
00:54:49,500 --> 00:54:50,340
 - Sorry, I got very excited.

1679
00:54:50,340 --> 00:54:51,180
 - No, it is exciting.

1680
00:54:51,180 --> 00:54:52,020
 It's incredible.

1681
00:54:52,020 --> 00:54:54,620
 - Do you know, is his name Svante Pabo?

1682
00:54:54,620 --> 00:54:55,660
 - Svante Pabo, yeah.

1683
00:54:55,660 --> 00:54:57,420
 - So he's a Swedish DNA expert.

1684
00:54:57,420 --> 00:54:59,900
 And I think, did he start the field of extracting DNA

1685
00:54:59,900 --> 00:55:00,740
 from ancient bones?

1686
00:55:00,740 --> 00:55:01,860
 - He got a Nobel Prize for it.

1687
00:55:01,860 --> 00:55:02,820
 - Oh, nice.

1688
00:55:02,820 --> 00:55:05,380
 Well, congratulations, Professor Pabo.

1689
00:55:05,380 --> 00:55:07,620
 - And it was really funny because he won it for medicine.

1690
00:55:07,620 --> 00:55:10,940
 And everybody went, we just had COVID.

1691
00:55:10,940 --> 00:55:11,860
 What?

1692
00:55:11,860 --> 00:55:12,900
 We just had COVID.

1693
00:55:12,900 --> 00:55:13,860
 And you've given it to this guy.

1694
00:55:13,860 --> 00:55:16,580
 He's found a DNA for slow clap.

1695
00:55:16,580 --> 00:55:19,420
 - He published this study.

1696
00:55:19,420 --> 00:55:22,140
 And you know, he'd realized that you could extract DNA

1697
00:55:22,140 --> 00:55:22,980
 from old bones.

1698
00:55:22,980 --> 00:55:23,820
 And that's a huge realization.

1699
00:55:23,820 --> 00:55:25,060
 He worked out how to do it as well.

1700
00:55:25,060 --> 00:55:28,580
 And he got letters, lots of letters from men saying,

1701
00:55:28,580 --> 00:55:31,100
 "I'm Neanderthal actually."

1702
00:55:31,100 --> 00:55:33,900
 And he said, "Fully or partly, Neanderthal."

1703
00:55:33,900 --> 00:55:37,220
 And offering him samples to analyze for his work.

1704
00:55:37,220 --> 00:55:38,540
 - What kind of samples?

1705
00:55:38,540 --> 00:55:39,500
 - I think spit samples.

1706
00:55:39,500 --> 00:55:42,500
 I think, but there's a really interesting,

1707
00:55:42,500 --> 00:55:44,820
 there's definitely a gender divide here

1708
00:55:44,820 --> 00:55:48,020
 because 12 women wrote into him to say,

1709
00:55:48,020 --> 00:55:50,860
 "My husband is definitely, he's a Neanderthal."

1710
00:55:50,860 --> 00:55:52,300
 You can study him if you like.

1711
00:55:52,300 --> 00:55:55,860
 Only two men wrote saying the same of their wives.

1712
00:55:55,860 --> 00:55:57,580
 And I don't know if any women wrote in saying,

1713
00:55:57,580 --> 00:56:00,140
 "I think I'm pretty sure I'm a Neanderthal."

1714
00:56:00,140 --> 00:56:00,980
 So there's an interesting thing

1715
00:56:00,980 --> 00:56:02,660
 about how we think of Neanderthals today.

1716
00:56:02,660 --> 00:56:04,380
 That's what it tells us about, really.

1717
00:56:04,380 --> 00:56:05,220
 - Fair enough.

1718
00:56:05,220 --> 00:56:06,980
 - That's actually so true because,

1719
00:56:06,980 --> 00:56:09,500
 sorry, I pointed at you very aggressively then, but.

1720
00:56:09,500 --> 00:56:10,940
 - Andy just for the listeners.

1721
00:56:10,940 --> 00:56:11,900
 - Yes.

1722
00:56:11,900 --> 00:56:15,900
 So I made a show called Neanderthals for the BBC and PBS.

1723
00:56:15,900 --> 00:56:17,380
 And.

1724
00:56:17,380 --> 00:56:19,500
 - Oh, with Andy Serkis.

1725
00:56:19,500 --> 00:56:21,820
 - Andy Serkis who is Gollum in Lord of the Rings.

1726
00:56:21,820 --> 00:56:22,940
 - Yeah, and a million other things.

1727
00:56:22,940 --> 00:56:25,340
 Like the guy's got a very impressive resume.

1728
00:56:25,340 --> 00:56:27,260
 And there was this really big discussion

1729
00:56:27,260 --> 00:56:29,300
 because we were like, "Blatingly, you're gonna make,

1730
00:56:29,300 --> 00:56:31,260
 "the reconstruction is gonna be a male."

1731
00:56:31,260 --> 00:56:34,500
 But actually, why are the reconstructions of cave men

1732
00:56:34,500 --> 00:56:36,020
 always men?

1733
00:56:36,020 --> 00:56:36,860
 Like, it doesn't make,

1734
00:56:36,860 --> 00:56:38,380
 like think about the descent of man image

1735
00:56:38,380 --> 00:56:40,420
 where it's like, you know, from ape to human.

1736
00:56:40,420 --> 00:56:41,660
 It's always just men.

1737
00:56:41,660 --> 00:56:42,940
 And it's like, well, they definitely

1738
00:56:42,940 --> 00:56:44,260
 didn't do that on their own, right?

1739
00:56:44,260 --> 00:56:46,420
 So it's like, where are the women in this?

1740
00:56:46,420 --> 00:56:47,940
 And we had a really big discussion.

1741
00:56:47,940 --> 00:56:51,500
 And in the end, we did make a man and we called it Ned.

1742
00:56:51,500 --> 00:56:52,620
 But we did make a Nelly.

1743
00:56:52,620 --> 00:56:55,460
 But the Nelly was not of the same quality.

1744
00:56:55,460 --> 00:56:58,420
 The animation wasn't, it wasn't Andy Serkis' work.

1745
00:56:58,420 --> 00:56:59,260
 Let's just put it like that.

1746
00:56:59,260 --> 00:57:02,060
 - Was Andy Serkis playing the motion capture Neanderthal?

1747
00:57:02,060 --> 00:57:03,780
 - He brought the Neanderthal to life, basically.

1748
00:57:03,780 --> 00:57:06,620
 - Did he co-host as that?

1749
00:57:06,620 --> 00:57:08,980
 - No, no, no, he was, there's this scene where he,

1750
00:57:08,980 --> 00:57:09,940
 actually, I love this scene.

1751
00:57:09,940 --> 00:57:11,380
 It kind of gives me goosebumps when I see it,

1752
00:57:11,380 --> 00:57:13,620
 where he wakes the Neanderthal up from his slumber.

1753
00:57:13,620 --> 00:57:16,020
 So it's an Iraqi Neanderthal and he wakes it up from its slumber.

1754
00:57:16,020 --> 00:57:16,860
 So he's used it.

1755
00:57:16,860 --> 00:57:19,340
 He's like Andy's freaking Serkis.

1756
00:57:19,340 --> 00:57:21,300
 - Was he both of the male and the female?

1757
00:57:21,300 --> 00:57:22,140
 - No, no, no.

1758
00:57:22,140 --> 00:57:24,580
 They literally, then he was forgotten about.

1759
00:57:24,580 --> 00:57:25,660
 Not in your Nelly.

1760
00:57:25,660 --> 00:57:27,420
 - No, no, no, no, no.

1761
00:57:27,420 --> 00:57:28,260
 - But he was.

1762
00:57:28,260 --> 00:57:30,260
 - I do wish he co-hosted it as the end of the film.

1763
00:57:30,260 --> 00:57:31,100
 - Yeah, that would have been.

1764
00:57:31,100 --> 00:57:31,940
 - What could she have been?

1765
00:57:31,940 --> 00:57:32,780
 - Al-Shamahi.

1766
00:57:32,780 --> 00:57:35,020
 (laughing)

1767
00:57:35,020 --> 00:57:38,100
 - So do you guys know why Neanderthals

1768
00:57:38,100 --> 00:57:40,220
 have got such a bad rep?

1769
00:57:40,220 --> 00:57:42,100
 - Oh, oh, was it, oh.

1770
00:57:42,100 --> 00:57:44,820
 - Did they find what were effectively, unfortunately,

1771
00:57:44,820 --> 00:57:47,100
 deformed skeletons and so on?

1772
00:57:47,100 --> 00:57:48,660
 And yeah, and so we just thought,

1773
00:57:48,660 --> 00:57:51,020
 ah, that must be what they all looked like.

1774
00:57:51,020 --> 00:57:55,180
 - Yeah, so basically it was an individual,

1775
00:57:55,180 --> 00:57:58,900
 L'Achabalocin, don't query my French.

1776
00:57:58,900 --> 00:58:02,900
 And it was a highly arthritic individual.

1777
00:58:02,900 --> 00:58:04,780
 It was an old man, although I'm pretty sure

1778
00:58:04,780 --> 00:58:07,900
 it was only like 40, but, you know, old for the time,

1779
00:58:07,900 --> 00:58:09,980
 but very young for today.

1780
00:58:09,980 --> 00:58:12,220
 (laughing)

1781
00:58:12,220 --> 00:58:13,900
 And they basically, he was--

1782
00:58:13,900 --> 00:58:14,940
 - I don't like the way you looked at me

1783
00:58:14,940 --> 00:58:16,260
 when you said that, I like that.

1784
00:58:16,260 --> 00:58:17,460
 (laughing)

1785
00:58:17,460 --> 00:58:19,020
 - He was highly arthritic.

1786
00:58:19,020 --> 00:58:21,460
 And there's a number of things going on here,

1787
00:58:21,460 --> 00:58:26,460
 but the guy who did the reconstruction of this fossil

1788
00:58:26,460 --> 00:58:30,060
 basically portrayed it as being like,

1789
00:58:30,060 --> 00:58:31,220
 essentially knuckle-dragging,

1790
00:58:31,220 --> 00:58:34,020
 well, kind of its heads jutting forward.

1791
00:58:34,020 --> 00:58:37,340
 It's, you know, its knees are bent, blah, blah, blah.

1792
00:58:37,340 --> 00:58:40,100
 And then they obviously realized later on

1793
00:58:40,100 --> 00:58:41,660
 that that was completely incorrect,

1794
00:58:41,660 --> 00:58:42,500
 but it was too late.

1795
00:58:42,500 --> 00:58:44,580
 It was like it got out there that this is,

1796
00:58:44,580 --> 00:58:46,380
 and because we were looking for a missing link

1797
00:58:46,380 --> 00:58:47,620
 in inverted commas, right?

1798
00:58:47,620 --> 00:58:49,140
 So it kind of fit the narrative.

1799
00:58:49,140 --> 00:58:50,780
 And it was a new field, right?

1800
00:58:50,780 --> 00:58:53,940
 Reconstructing what somebody looked like from a fossil

1801
00:58:53,940 --> 00:58:55,540
 was such a new field that, you know,

1802
00:58:55,540 --> 00:58:57,940
 and so essentially, it's everybody's speculating since

1803
00:58:57,940 --> 00:58:59,380
 as to why he did such a bad job,

1804
00:58:59,380 --> 00:59:01,940
 which is really embarrassing because he's a legacy

1805
00:59:01,940 --> 00:59:04,980
 amongst other things, 'cause he's quite a renowned person,

1806
00:59:04,980 --> 00:59:07,740
 is that he basically did an awful PR job on the underfills.

1807
00:59:07,740 --> 00:59:11,100
 - Oh, this is amazing, like if just like, for instance,

1808
00:59:11,100 --> 00:59:13,260
 in a million years time, they find humans

1809
00:59:13,260 --> 00:59:16,300
 and they only find my body,

1810
00:59:16,300 --> 00:59:18,300
 I have very bad sinuses, right?

1811
00:59:18,300 --> 00:59:21,300
 They're just gonna think all humans had a cold all the time.

1812
00:59:21,300 --> 00:59:22,140
 - That's it.

1813
00:59:22,140 --> 00:59:22,980
 - Yeah, that's it.

1814
00:59:22,980 --> 00:59:24,340
 - You know, and that's basically what happened.

1815
00:59:24,340 --> 00:59:25,180
 - That's completely--

1816
00:59:25,180 --> 00:59:26,740
 - They're gonna find Dan's body and think

1817
00:59:26,740 --> 00:59:28,500
 all humans were unbelievably hairy.

1818
00:59:28,500 --> 00:59:30,300
 - So they'll think, oh, wait, they--

1819
00:59:30,300 --> 00:59:31,860
 - I love how you guys don't know how bodies

1820
00:59:31,860 --> 00:59:33,660
 and decomposition work, so we're sure, yeah,

1821
00:59:33,660 --> 00:59:35,860
 hair is gonna be found on--

1822
00:59:35,860 --> 00:59:36,900
 - They'll find Andy and they'll be like,

1823
00:59:36,900 --> 00:59:40,900
 well, all humans used to make model hair replacements.

1824
00:59:40,900 --> 00:59:42,460
 - That's 'cause they'll have found me in my tomb

1825
00:59:42,460 --> 00:59:44,980
 where I've been buried with all my air fixes.

1826
00:59:44,980 --> 00:59:47,420
 - And all your rivet pivots, rivets, rivets.

1827
00:59:47,420 --> 00:59:48,380
 - Oh, my riveting.

1828
00:59:48,380 --> 00:59:49,900
 (all laughing)

1829
00:59:49,900 --> 00:59:52,480
 (upbeat music)

1830
00:59:52,480 --> 00:59:56,860
 - Okay, that's it, that is all of our facts.

1831
00:59:56,860 --> 00:59:58,340
