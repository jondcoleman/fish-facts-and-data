00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580
 (upbeat music)

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:05.800
 - Hi everyone, welcome to this week's episode

00:00:05.800 --> 00:00:07.040
 of "Notice Things of Fish"

00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:12.040
 where we are joined by the wonderful Ella Al-Shemahi.

00:00:12.040 --> 00:00:16.280
 You might remember Ella from episode 373

00:00:16.280 --> 00:00:19.800
 of "Notice Things of Fish" when she last appeared,

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:21.040
 but if you don't remember that,

00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:24.520
 then she is a paleoanthropologist.

00:00:24.520 --> 00:00:26.200
 She's an expert in Neanderthals.

00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:29.200
 She is a National Geographic Explorer.

00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:32.000
 She's just an all-round badass.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.160
 Ella has written a book called "The Handshake

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:36.440
 "A Gripping History,"

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:38.560
 which we talked about last time she was on,

00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:40.900
 but she's also been on loads of TV shows,

00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:42.360
 loads of documentaries.

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:45.500
 The last one I think was called "Our Changing Planet,"

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:48.320
 all about the world's most threatened ecosystems,

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:49.900
 and you can actually still watch that

00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:54.140
 if you go to BBC iPlayer or PBS Video app.

00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:56.360
 Anyway, really hope you enjoyed this week's show.

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:58.160
 Don't forget, "Club Fish" exists,

00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:00.720
 a place where you can get loads of extra content

00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:02.480
 and ad-free episodes.

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:05.480
 Don't forget, there are still one or two tickets,

00:01:05.480 --> 00:01:08.780
 I think, possibly left for our live shows

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:10.720
 coming up in the Soho Theatre in London,

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:12.040
 and you can get those by going to

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:15.240
 noticethingsofish.com/soho.

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:16.640
 Anyway, that's enough of that.

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:18.800
 Really hope you enjoy this week's show with Ella,

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:21.000
 and it's on with the podcast.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.580
 (upbeat music)

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:28.420
 (speaking in foreign language)

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:38.140
 - Hello, and welcome to another episode

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:40.700
 of No Such Thing as a Fish, a weekly podcast

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:43.460
 coming to you from the QI offices in Hoburn.

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:45.500
 My name is Dan Schreiber, I am sitting here

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:47.940
 with Andrew Hunter Murray, James Harkin,

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:50.140
 and Ella Alshamahi, and once again,

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:51.700
 we have gathered around the microphones

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:54.340
 with our four favorite facts from the last seven days,

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:57.060
 and in no particular order, here we go.

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:00.460
 Starting with fact number one, and that is Ella.

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:03.740
 - American beer was so bad in the early 1900s

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:08.740
 that the US government sent Alexander Graham Bell's son-in-law

00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:14.140
 on a secret mission to Bavaria to steal German hops.

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:16.780
 - Wow, God, so much to unpack.

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:20.340
 - Yeah, okay, so Alexander Graham Bell's son-in-law,

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:21.540
 was that an important part of,

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:22.660
 was that what the American government

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:23.860
 were looking for, was that the brief?

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:26.180
 - The really sad thing is, David Fairchild

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:28.460
 is like a hugely celebrated botanist,

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:30.540
 and is described as the food explorer,

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:31.700
 and yet for our purposes,

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:34.140
 he's just Alexander Graham Bell's son-in-law.

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:36.620
 'Cause to be fair, if he was your father-in-law,

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:38.540
 that's the end of your identity, right?

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:39.860
 - But was it, maybe this was at the point

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:42.060
 when there was only two telephones in the country,

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:43.780
 and so the government would just call him up

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:46.040
 and say, "You got anyone we could use?"

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:46.880
 - Yeah.

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:49.100
 - So you think when he invented two telephones,

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:51.140
 Alexander Graham Bell, he gave one to the government,

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:54.380
 and kept one himself, and no one else needs one, it's fine.

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:55.660
 - And it became like the bat phone,

00:02:55.660 --> 00:02:57.460
 was any time they were needed for anything.

00:02:57.460 --> 00:02:58.300
 - The bell phone.

00:02:58.300 --> 00:02:59.140
 - Yeah, the bell phone.

00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:01.300
 - I'm loving the facts today, guys.

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:03.340
 - So yeah, what's this guy, Fairchild?

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:04.660
 - So, all right, so David Fairchild,

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:08.420
 so he's a food explorer, and I think he's absolutely

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:11.100
 fascinating, 'cause explorers usually go around the planet,

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:12.380
 let's be honest, discovering stuff,

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:14.500
 but also pillaging a lot, and what have you,

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:17.540
 and like stealing artifacts, and whatever takes your fancy.

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:21.100
 But this guy did it with plants, with botany,

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:23.620
 which is, in my mind, is just like the loveliest thing

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:25.380
 to go around the planet stealing.

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:27.260
 (laughing)

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:29.220
 'Cause all he's doing is, he's basically turned around

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:31.300
 at the beginning of the 1900s going,

00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:33.460
 and the end of the 1800s going,

00:03:33.460 --> 00:03:36.020
 America is a country clearly on the rise,

00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:39.660
 but our agriculture's bad, our food is bad,

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:44.540
 but our industries as related to plants are just bad,

00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:47.260
 so I'm gonna go off to 50-odd countries,

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:51.220
 and just collect samples, send seeds back,

00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:53.100
 send saplings back, that kind of thing.

00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:55.780
 And because it's plants, I just can't get mad at him,

00:03:55.780 --> 00:03:57.580
 because I'm just like, you were just helping

00:03:57.580 --> 00:03:59.540
 to feed your people, and build industry.

00:03:59.540 --> 00:04:01.700
 - Could we get him canceled because he was like,

00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:03.660
 stealing from the farms in other countries?

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:04.900
 - Are you trying to get him canceled?

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:06.340
 - I'm doing my best.

00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:08.500
 I do this on this podcast, you know, and we have that.

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:10.460
 - Don't ever mention anyone you like on this show.

00:04:10.460 --> 00:04:12.620
 James will find a way to destroy it.

00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:14.700
 - Do not do this to me, 'cause I actually,

00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:17.540
 I've decided that he's like the one explorer

00:04:17.540 --> 00:04:19.300
 that I really have nothing bad to say about.

00:04:19.300 --> 00:04:20.980
 I'm like, I'm not fair enough,

00:04:20.980 --> 00:04:22.300
 you're trying to feed your people.

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:24.900
 He did give the Americans broccoli and kale, so.

00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:26.860
 - Oh yeah, yeah, I love those two things.

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:30.060
 - It's interesting how limited American food was.

00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:33.620
 I didn't really appreciate that before the 1890s,

00:04:33.620 --> 00:04:34.580
 when he really got crack.

00:04:34.580 --> 00:04:36.180
 They had occasional introductions,

00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:39.260
 like in the World's Fair in 1876,

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:41.500
 which was effectively America's 100th birthday,

00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:43.820
 they got the banana, that was good.

00:04:43.820 --> 00:04:44.660
 That was a big advance.

00:04:44.660 --> 00:04:47.300
 - Also, can we just take a second to talk about world fairs?

00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:48.860
 Aren't they just the best thing ever?

00:04:48.860 --> 00:04:49.860
 - Yeah.

00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:51.060
 - Just this world where you were like,

00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:53.540
 oh, let's just do a World Fair.

00:04:53.540 --> 00:04:55.260
 And it actually was like everyone was like,

00:04:55.260 --> 00:04:56.540
 oh crap, that's actually, that's new.

00:04:56.540 --> 00:04:57.380
 That's, what is that?

00:04:57.380 --> 00:04:58.220
 It's yellow and it's bendy.

00:04:58.220 --> 00:04:59.060
 That's amazing.

00:04:59.060 --> 00:04:59.940
 - When did we last have one?

00:04:59.940 --> 00:05:00.780
 It's been a long time.

00:05:00.780 --> 00:05:02.980
 - Well, I went to one in Dubai this year.

00:05:02.980 --> 00:05:04.820
 - Oh yes, okay, so this year.

00:05:04.820 --> 00:05:06.340
 - Oh yeah, they did that, hold on.

00:05:06.340 --> 00:05:08.180
 - Well, they did one during COVID,

00:05:08.180 --> 00:05:10.220
 and obviously no one could go.

00:05:10.220 --> 00:05:13.380
 And then when I went, everything was closed.

00:05:13.380 --> 00:05:15.780
 So you couldn't even get an Uber, everyone had gone home.

00:05:15.780 --> 00:05:16.620
 - Oh, right.

00:05:16.620 --> 00:05:17.460
 - 'Cause that's what it is.

00:05:17.460 --> 00:05:20.300
 They build them these sort of huge things, don't they?

00:05:20.300 --> 00:05:22.700
 And all the different countries have their different stalls

00:05:22.700 --> 00:05:24.540
 where they're saying, in Uzbekistan,

00:05:24.540 --> 00:05:26.620
 we make amazing bananas or whatever.

00:05:26.620 --> 00:05:29.180
 And then two years later, they all go home and that's it.

00:05:29.180 --> 00:05:31.940
 - They only do with countries that are on the rise, right?

00:05:31.940 --> 00:05:32.780
 - Yeah.

00:05:32.780 --> 00:05:34.580
 - Like, we wouldn't do a world,

00:05:34.580 --> 00:05:36.060
 America wouldn't do a World Fair anymore.

00:05:36.060 --> 00:05:38.300
 We are the world, why would we do a World Fair?

00:05:38.300 --> 00:05:39.260
 - There was the big one in America.

00:05:39.260 --> 00:05:40.660
 Carl Sagan went to as a kid.

00:05:40.660 --> 00:05:43.140
 So Sagan would be in his 80s if he was still alive

00:05:43.140 --> 00:05:45.380
 in the 1990s, so, you know, within that world.

00:05:45.380 --> 00:05:48.060
 - The one in Dubai, just to say this is quite interesting

00:05:48.060 --> 00:05:51.460
 'cause each country made their own sort of building

00:05:51.460 --> 00:05:52.900
 and they were all kind of shaped

00:05:52.900 --> 00:05:56.620
 with Uzbekistani design or Azerbaijani design or whatever.

00:05:56.620 --> 00:05:57.780
 And now they're changing it

00:05:57.780 --> 00:06:00.300
 and they're turning it into flats the whole place.

00:06:00.300 --> 00:06:01.140
 - Oh wow.

00:06:01.140 --> 00:06:03.140
 - And they're gonna make it so you can live in this area.

00:06:03.140 --> 00:06:04.660
 But it means that all these buildings

00:06:04.660 --> 00:06:06.620
 are just these incredible designs

00:06:06.620 --> 00:06:08.620
 that have made from the best architects in the world.

00:06:08.620 --> 00:06:09.940
 - It sounds like you're selling Dubai

00:06:09.940 --> 00:06:10.980
 instead of cancelling Dubai,

00:06:10.980 --> 00:06:14.620
 which I thought you were the cancelling Dubai.

00:06:14.620 --> 00:06:15.460
 - Is it Dubai?

00:06:15.460 --> 00:06:16.820
 - There's no, you can't get an Uber there.

00:06:16.820 --> 00:06:18.420
 You can't, there's no shops there already for you.

00:06:18.420 --> 00:06:19.260
 So I'm gonna live here.

00:06:19.260 --> 00:06:22.500
 - Oh, that's the bad side of Dubai, guys.

00:06:22.500 --> 00:06:24.140
 I'm all the bad crap.

00:06:24.140 --> 00:06:26.260
 - Famously, there are no shops in Dubai.

00:06:26.260 --> 00:06:30.620
 Someone emailed in and I've got a bunch of their fact now

00:06:30.620 --> 00:06:32.100
 and also not credit them

00:06:32.100 --> 00:06:32.940
 'cause I don't think we're gonna end up

00:06:32.940 --> 00:06:34.220
 talking about World Fairs.

00:06:34.220 --> 00:06:37.300
 It was a few years ago, the Brazilian delegation

00:06:37.300 --> 00:06:40.820
 turned their entire thing into a trampoline.

00:06:40.820 --> 00:06:41.660
 - What?

00:06:41.660 --> 00:06:43.420
 - It was something like a 4,000 square foot trampoline,

00:06:43.420 --> 00:06:45.900
 the Brazilian bit of the world.

00:06:45.900 --> 00:06:47.060
 - Was it to sell rubber?

00:06:47.060 --> 00:06:48.340
 - I don't think it was.

00:06:48.340 --> 00:06:49.580
 I don't even think it was.

00:06:49.580 --> 00:06:50.700
 I think it was just saying,

00:06:50.700 --> 00:06:52.820
 look, everyone else has got good stuff here.

00:06:52.820 --> 00:06:54.100
 Well, you've got a big old trampoline.

00:06:54.100 --> 00:06:56.620
 So just come along, have a bounce, enjoy yourself.

00:06:56.620 --> 00:07:00.140
 - They had a big project that at the last minute

00:07:00.140 --> 00:07:00.980
 got taken away.

00:07:00.980 --> 00:07:03.300
 They went, what have we got?

00:07:03.300 --> 00:07:04.740
 - Why are we talking about the World Fair?

00:07:04.740 --> 00:07:05.580
 - I'm sorry, I got distracted.

00:07:05.580 --> 00:07:07.340
 - Yeah, this is what happens when Ella is around.

00:07:07.340 --> 00:07:08.860
 - Because during the World Fair,

00:07:08.860 --> 00:07:10.540
 the banana was introduced to America.

00:07:10.540 --> 00:07:11.380
 - Yeah.

00:07:11.380 --> 00:07:12.460
 - And it's not food introduction.

00:07:12.460 --> 00:07:13.980
 - By Fairchild or someone else.

00:07:13.980 --> 00:07:16.340
 - By someone else, that was like a sporadic thing.

00:07:16.340 --> 00:07:18.460
 But then when he really got going,

00:07:18.460 --> 00:07:19.980
 he was privately funded as well.

00:07:19.980 --> 00:07:20.820
 - Yes.

00:07:20.820 --> 00:07:22.020
 - By Barbaul Lathrop.

00:07:22.020 --> 00:07:22.860
 - Yes, yes, yes.

00:07:22.860 --> 00:07:25.860
 A wonderfully gay, fabulous figure, basically,

00:07:25.860 --> 00:07:27.780
 who was just this incredible philanthropist.

00:07:27.780 --> 00:07:29.620
 - Squillionaire, just looking for something to fund.

00:07:29.620 --> 00:07:31.460
 - And they bumped into each other on a boat, didn't they?

00:07:31.460 --> 00:07:33.500
 And he just went, I'll fund this trip.

00:07:33.500 --> 00:07:35.700
 Are you trying to steal avocados?

00:07:35.700 --> 00:07:37.020
 - Yeah, why not?

00:07:37.020 --> 00:07:37.860
 This sounds great.

00:07:37.860 --> 00:07:41.420
 - Can I just say, as an explorer with National Geographic,

00:07:41.420 --> 00:07:43.780
 that is our dream, that we're like, no, no, no.

00:07:43.780 --> 00:07:45.940
 If you think I am kidding, you do not know,

00:07:45.940 --> 00:07:48.020
 like my friend group, in the sense that we are like,

00:07:48.020 --> 00:07:49.660
 we literally just sit there, constantly going,

00:07:49.660 --> 00:07:52.140
 all right, how do we get this kind of thing

00:07:52.140 --> 00:07:53.180
 from philanthropy?

00:07:53.180 --> 00:07:54.900
 And every so often it works out.

00:07:54.900 --> 00:07:56.500
 So I've got friends that like,

00:07:56.500 --> 00:07:59.420
 they're like this smart friend of the philanthropist,

00:07:59.420 --> 00:08:01.500
 who is like some billionaire or millionaire.

00:08:01.500 --> 00:08:03.420
 - They're like their sugar mama, dadda, whatever.

00:08:03.420 --> 00:08:05.780
 - Have I ever told you the story of Nat Geo?

00:08:05.780 --> 00:08:07.060
 Somebody walks up to me.

00:08:07.060 --> 00:08:08.660
 It's really old guy, bless him.

00:08:08.660 --> 00:08:10.620
 That's the first time I've ever been at National Geographic.

00:08:10.620 --> 00:08:13.540
 And he looks at me and goes, I'm from Austin, Texas.

00:08:13.540 --> 00:08:14.980
 I'm not an oil man, but I've got money

00:08:14.980 --> 00:08:16.320
 and I want to give you some.

00:08:16.320 --> 00:08:17.660
 (laughing)

00:08:17.660 --> 00:08:19.060
 - What the hell?

00:08:19.060 --> 00:08:20.700
 - I saw that money in my account.

00:08:20.700 --> 00:08:22.420
 An expedition was part funded by it.

00:08:22.420 --> 00:08:24.140
 - Wow, so as simple as that.

00:08:24.140 --> 00:08:25.260
 Okay, so it does happen.

00:08:25.260 --> 00:08:27.020
 Yeah, that's amazing.

00:08:27.020 --> 00:08:28.860
 So Fairchild, I agree.

00:08:28.860 --> 00:08:30.540
 I think reading about him,

00:08:30.540 --> 00:08:31.860
 he seems like an extraordinary guy.

00:08:31.860 --> 00:08:34.540
 I'm surprised I'd never heard of him, for example.

00:08:34.540 --> 00:08:36.420
 But if you're in America and you're eating,

00:08:36.420 --> 00:08:39.980
 say like peaches or nectarines or avocados or mangoes,

00:08:39.980 --> 00:08:42.540
 most likely the one that you're eating right now,

00:08:42.540 --> 00:08:44.860
 someone's bound to be eating one right now as they listen,

00:08:44.860 --> 00:08:47.280
 shares genes from the ones that Fairchild

00:08:47.280 --> 00:08:49.980
 introduced to the country all those years ago.

00:08:49.980 --> 00:08:54.380
 What a sort of footprint he's left in the country.

00:08:54.380 --> 00:08:55.620
 - It's incredible.

00:08:55.620 --> 00:08:57.340
 - Send us your photos.

00:08:57.340 --> 00:09:01.340
 If you're eating a mango now in America specifically,

00:09:01.340 --> 00:09:03.860
 or an avocado, some quinoa.

00:09:03.860 --> 00:09:05.580
 - Yeah, did he bring in quinoa?

00:09:05.580 --> 00:09:07.780
 - Yep, podcast at qi.com.

00:09:07.780 --> 00:09:09.060
 - Mangosteens?

00:09:09.060 --> 00:09:11.420
 - The mangosteen, oh great, let's talk about this.

00:09:11.420 --> 00:09:12.300
 This is great.

00:09:12.300 --> 00:09:14.300
 - Go on, what about the mangosteen?

00:09:14.300 --> 00:09:17.660
 - It's a fruit that he introduced and that never took off.

00:09:17.660 --> 00:09:18.980
 'Cause he introduced thousands.

00:09:18.980 --> 00:09:19.820
 And they didn't all take off.

00:09:19.820 --> 00:09:22.540
 - Yeah, you can still buy mangosteens though, can't you?

00:09:22.540 --> 00:09:23.380
 - Think so.

00:09:23.380 --> 00:09:24.460
 They just never explained it.

00:09:24.460 --> 00:09:26.100
 - I had never heard of the mangosteen before.

00:09:26.100 --> 00:09:27.060
 - I had never. - Really?

00:09:27.060 --> 00:09:27.900
 - Yeah.

00:09:27.900 --> 00:09:30.500
 - The guy who wrote the book on David Fairchild

00:09:30.500 --> 00:09:32.060
 is Dan Stone, who's a friend of mine.

00:09:32.060 --> 00:09:34.180
 And apparently while he was writing this book,

00:09:34.180 --> 00:09:36.780
 everybody would just send him really exotic fruit

00:09:36.780 --> 00:09:38.460
 like for the whole time he was writing the book.

00:09:38.460 --> 00:09:40.380
 'Cause they were like, this is good for you, no?

00:09:40.380 --> 00:09:41.860
 - Yeah. - He's not sure.

00:09:41.860 --> 00:09:43.540
 - Yeah, the book's called The Food Explorer, by the way.

00:09:43.540 --> 00:09:46.060
 I think it's fair to say that every bit of research I have

00:09:46.060 --> 00:09:48.540
 is from Dan Stone, so yeah, well done.

00:09:48.540 --> 00:09:50.340
 - So Dan, tell us about mangosteen, Sandy.

00:09:50.340 --> 00:09:51.940
 - Well, as far as I can tell,

00:09:51.940 --> 00:09:53.900
 again, Dan and I have never heard of them before

00:09:53.900 --> 00:09:55.780
 and you two are having them for breakfast every day.

00:09:55.780 --> 00:09:57.060
 So correct me if I'm wrong.

00:09:57.060 --> 00:10:00.860
 But the size of a fist, roughly, and they're like a lychee.

00:10:00.860 --> 00:10:01.700
 - Brilliant.

00:10:01.700 --> 00:10:03.780
 - But the problem is, they're not great for farming.

00:10:03.780 --> 00:10:05.820
 And what he was doing, Fairchild,

00:10:05.820 --> 00:10:07.620
 you have to persuade the farmers to grow the things

00:10:07.620 --> 00:10:08.940
 and the public to buy them.

00:10:08.940 --> 00:10:11.260
 So it's got two jobs to carry out, basically.

00:10:11.260 --> 00:10:12.900
 And he couldn't persuade either, apparently,

00:10:12.900 --> 00:10:13.980
 either side of the equation.

00:10:13.980 --> 00:10:17.340
 'Cause they're really hard, they bruise worse than peaches

00:10:17.340 --> 00:10:19.660
 and they're just a nightmare to transport

00:10:19.660 --> 00:10:21.580
 and they go off really quickly.

00:10:21.580 --> 00:10:23.540
 But he said they were the queen of fruits.

00:10:23.540 --> 00:10:24.820
 - They were his favorites. - Oh, really?

00:10:24.820 --> 00:10:25.940
 - I know. - And he kept trying

00:10:25.940 --> 00:10:28.740
 to make them happen, like fetch in Mean Girls.

00:10:28.740 --> 00:10:29.580
 (laughing)

00:10:29.580 --> 00:10:30.940
 He kept trying to make it happen

00:10:30.940 --> 00:10:33.060
 and no one was picking up on it.

00:10:33.060 --> 00:10:35.020
 And so all these things he brought into the country,

00:10:35.020 --> 00:10:37.700
 but the one of which you headlined your fact with

00:10:37.700 --> 00:10:40.260
 is very interesting because it was the beer hops.

00:10:40.260 --> 00:10:41.940
 And you'd think you'd just go into a country,

00:10:41.940 --> 00:10:43.540
 grab some fruit and leave the country,

00:10:43.540 --> 00:10:45.340
 but no, people were so protective.

00:10:45.340 --> 00:10:48.660
 They would have boys sleeping with the hops at night

00:10:48.660 --> 00:10:49.500
 to make sure no one would steal.

00:10:49.500 --> 00:10:51.100
 - Yeah, they would pay to security, that's the thing.

00:10:51.100 --> 00:10:53.740
 - So he'd come in and integrate himself with the communities.

00:10:53.740 --> 00:10:55.180
 He would sort of become friends.

00:10:55.180 --> 00:10:57.060
 - And so this particular hop,

00:10:57.060 --> 00:10:58.500
 so this is, I think, the Sems hop,

00:10:58.500 --> 00:11:02.300
 he basically started talking about Sems,

00:11:02.300 --> 00:11:04.460
 the guy that came up with it, who was dead at this point.

00:11:04.460 --> 00:11:08.620
 And he offered the son of Sems, basically he said,

00:11:08.620 --> 00:11:10.820
 "Look, I'm really scared that in a few generations,

00:11:10.820 --> 00:11:12.940
 "people aren't gonna know about your dad, blah, blah, blah."

00:11:12.940 --> 00:11:15.140
 So he was like, "Why don't you build a plaque?

00:11:15.140 --> 00:11:16.300
 "I will pay for it."

00:11:16.300 --> 00:11:18.820
 So he basically put money down.

00:11:18.820 --> 00:11:20.700
 Impressive US diplomacy here.

00:11:20.700 --> 00:11:23.180
 And they made such a song and dance about it.

00:11:23.180 --> 00:11:24.020
 Everybody was really happy.

00:11:24.020 --> 00:11:26.980
 The whole, like, everybody in the town was happy about it.

00:11:26.980 --> 00:11:30.220
 And then apparently somebody at night knocks on his door

00:11:30.220 --> 00:11:32.500
 when it's raining and goes, "Do you want some?

00:11:32.500 --> 00:11:33.900
 "Do you want some cuttings?"

00:11:33.900 --> 00:11:35.780
 And apparently he has to really restrain himself

00:11:35.780 --> 00:11:37.700
 to not be like, "Yes, this is exactly why I did all this

00:11:37.700 --> 00:11:40.220
 "and I've been manipulating you guys for weeks."

00:11:40.220 --> 00:11:41.540
 And he was like, "Yeah, okay."

00:11:41.540 --> 00:11:43.860
 And he goes, "Okay, I can't do this publicly.

00:11:43.860 --> 00:11:46.220
 "I have to do it quietly, but I'll send 100 cuttings

00:11:46.220 --> 00:11:48.260
 "to the next station down the line."

00:11:48.260 --> 00:11:49.700
 - Oh, not even handing them over now.

00:11:49.700 --> 00:11:50.940
 - No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

00:11:50.940 --> 00:11:52.380
 It was proper espionage.

00:11:52.380 --> 00:11:53.220
 - That's amazing.

00:11:53.220 --> 00:11:57.780
 - It's hilarious, but also to think of all the espionage

00:11:57.780 --> 00:11:59.140
 that the US government has ever done.

00:11:59.140 --> 00:12:01.100
 - I just can't object to this one.

00:12:01.100 --> 00:12:05.340
 - Yeah, that's why American beer now is so delicious.

00:12:05.340 --> 00:12:06.860
 (laughing)

00:12:06.860 --> 00:12:08.660
 I mean, how bad must it have been?

00:12:08.660 --> 00:12:10.460
 - So, here's the crazy thing.

00:12:10.460 --> 00:12:11.860
 Apparently during Prohibition,

00:12:11.860 --> 00:12:15.580
 all his hops were uprooted.

00:12:15.580 --> 00:12:17.420
 So all the same hops that Fertile Halled.

00:12:17.420 --> 00:12:18.260
 - Oh, really?

00:12:18.260 --> 00:12:19.340
 - Yeah, they were all uprooted during the--

00:12:19.340 --> 00:12:20.180
 - I read that.

00:12:20.180 --> 00:12:21.540
 Basically when Prohibition came in,

00:12:21.540 --> 00:12:23.620
 all the breweries closed down.

00:12:23.620 --> 00:12:24.980
 And then when they reopened,

00:12:24.980 --> 00:12:26.660
 there was a few more big ones

00:12:26.660 --> 00:12:28.940
 and they decided to sell what they knew would sell

00:12:28.940 --> 00:12:31.340
 'cause they weren't sure anyone would buy any beer anymore.

00:12:31.340 --> 00:12:33.020
 And so they went with the really safe stuff,

00:12:33.020 --> 00:12:36.300
 which was the light beers and the mass produced stuff.

00:12:36.300 --> 00:12:38.100
 - Okay, now can you explain Hershey's?

00:12:38.100 --> 00:12:39.460
 - Hershey's.

00:12:39.460 --> 00:12:40.300
 - Tastes like sick.

00:12:40.300 --> 00:12:42.140
 - Tastes like sick to British people.

00:12:42.140 --> 00:12:44.340
 - Well, you know, it contains some chemicals

00:12:44.340 --> 00:12:47.220
 which happen to also taste like sick.

00:12:47.220 --> 00:12:49.980
 - I don't know how people have gone around tasting sick.

00:12:49.980 --> 00:12:50.820
 They haven't, they haven't.

00:12:50.820 --> 00:12:51.660
 They really haven't.

00:12:51.660 --> 00:12:52.500
 That's not how it is.

00:12:52.500 --> 00:12:53.780
 - Well, if you're eating a Hershey's bar right now,

00:12:53.780 --> 00:12:54.980
 please send a photo.

00:12:54.980 --> 00:12:56.740
 If you're being sick, if you're, you know.

00:12:56.740 --> 00:12:58.300
 - Oh, yes, that one.

00:12:58.300 --> 00:13:00.540
 - Podcast at qr.com.

00:13:00.540 --> 00:13:02.220
 - Do they have your address?

00:13:02.220 --> 00:13:03.420
 'Cause I feel like if they have your address,

00:13:03.420 --> 00:13:05.900
 they could send the Mangosteans and the sick,

00:13:05.900 --> 00:13:07.740
 et cetera, et cetera, to the address.

00:13:07.740 --> 00:13:08.980
 - We've just moved offices.

00:13:08.980 --> 00:13:10.540
 And the reason being that the old office

00:13:10.540 --> 00:13:12.580
 was just full of sick and Mangosteans.

00:13:12.580 --> 00:13:13.860
 - Soon undated, yeah.

00:13:13.860 --> 00:13:16.140
 But everyone's tasted sick if they've ever been sick.

00:13:16.140 --> 00:13:16.980
 - True.

00:13:16.980 --> 00:13:17.820
 - You know.

00:13:17.820 --> 00:13:18.660
 - Oh, wow.

00:13:18.660 --> 00:13:19.500
 - You just taste it in reverse, don't you?

00:13:19.500 --> 00:13:21.620
 Sorry to, I mean to, you know, to lower the tone.

00:13:21.620 --> 00:13:22.460
 - That's nasty.

00:13:22.460 --> 00:13:24.500
 - That's how we know what American chocolate tastes like.

00:13:24.500 --> 00:13:25.340
 - Yeah.

00:13:25.340 --> 00:13:26.180
 - Great.

00:13:26.180 --> 00:13:27.020
 - Thank you.

00:13:27.020 --> 00:13:30.460
 - Could you guys hear about the cherry blossom trees in DC

00:13:30.460 --> 00:13:32.540
 and how he's responsible for all of them, basically?

00:13:32.540 --> 00:13:35.540
 So, I mean, we have them now in London quite a lot.

00:13:35.540 --> 00:13:37.500
 They're very kind of ornamental and very beautiful.

00:13:37.500 --> 00:13:38.940
 But he introduced them from Japan.

00:13:38.940 --> 00:13:41.620
 And then it became all the rage and people were like queuing

00:13:41.620 --> 00:13:43.980
 up to see him and Alexander Graham Bell's daughters.

00:13:43.980 --> 00:13:45.140
 - Is that their house, wasn't it?

00:13:45.140 --> 00:13:46.340
 He put it to his, yeah.

00:13:46.340 --> 00:13:47.580
 - Exactly, exactly.

00:13:47.580 --> 00:13:50.900
 And then basically Washington DC was not the beautiful

00:13:50.900 --> 00:13:52.700
 metropolis it now is.

00:13:52.700 --> 00:13:53.940
 Back then it was kind of ugly.

00:13:53.940 --> 00:13:56.620
 And he started saying, well, maybe we should just plant

00:13:56.620 --> 00:13:58.380
 some cherry blossom trees around here.

00:13:58.380 --> 00:13:59.700
 And that would be kind of beautiful.

00:13:59.700 --> 00:14:02.980
 And then the first lady heard of this.

00:14:02.980 --> 00:14:06.540
 And before you know it, the Japanese who at this point

00:14:06.540 --> 00:14:09.220
 they're not particularly like chummy with.

00:14:09.220 --> 00:14:11.100
 They're like, okay, this could be a symbol of friendship.

00:14:11.100 --> 00:14:13.660
 If you give us 300 cherry blossom trees,

00:14:13.660 --> 00:14:15.540
 we can plant them in DC.

00:14:15.540 --> 00:14:19.260
 And the Japanese got carried away, ended up shipping 2000.

00:14:19.260 --> 00:14:20.540
 But they opened the crate.

00:14:20.540 --> 00:14:22.660
 So I think it was in Seattle and went, oh crap,

00:14:22.660 --> 00:14:23.500
 they were diseased.

00:14:23.500 --> 00:14:25.860
 They were absolutely infested with invasive species.

00:14:25.860 --> 00:14:29.100
 So then they had to publicly burn the symbol of friendship

00:14:29.100 --> 00:14:31.580
 between Japan and the US.

00:14:31.580 --> 00:14:33.460
 And it was like on the front page of the New York Times.

00:14:33.460 --> 00:14:34.980
 - And the thing I read was it was from orders

00:14:34.980 --> 00:14:37.580
 of the president, which feels like he should have been busier

00:14:37.580 --> 00:14:39.700
 than having to make executive decisions

00:14:39.700 --> 00:14:42.020
 of agricultural imports.

00:14:42.020 --> 00:14:43.500
 - Although it was his decision, wasn't it?

00:14:43.500 --> 00:14:46.060
 Because it was him and the first lady who kind of made

00:14:46.060 --> 00:14:47.980
 the decision to bring it over, wasn't it?

00:14:47.980 --> 00:14:48.820
 - Wow.

00:14:48.820 --> 00:14:50.460
 - But the Japanese were like, are bad.

00:14:50.460 --> 00:14:51.980
 And so it was all fine.

00:14:51.980 --> 00:14:54.220
 They sent more over and then they are now.

00:14:54.220 --> 00:14:56.380
 - And as a result, US-Japanese relations

00:14:56.380 --> 00:14:57.780
 stayed very harmonious, didn't they?

00:14:57.780 --> 00:14:58.620
 - Yeah.

00:14:58.620 --> 00:14:59.620
 - Yeah, good.

00:14:59.620 --> 00:15:00.940
 - It was interesting 'cause the ones

00:15:00.940 --> 00:15:02.780
 that they sent over the second time,

00:15:02.780 --> 00:15:06.020
 they had to make sure that they were really not infested.

00:15:06.020 --> 00:15:08.780
 So they raised the trees in virgin soil.

00:15:08.780 --> 00:15:10.940
 So the soil was brand new

00:15:10.940 --> 00:15:12.940
 and they'd never been anywhere else.

00:15:12.940 --> 00:15:16.620
 They wrapped the roots in damp moss to stop any--

00:15:16.620 --> 00:15:18.020
 - It's a long work for a friendship man.

00:15:18.020 --> 00:15:18.860
 - Yeah.

00:15:18.860 --> 00:15:21.300
 - That's great.

00:15:21.300 --> 00:15:26.300
 And they fumigated it twice, once to asphyxiate the insects

00:15:26.300 --> 00:15:28.060
 and then once just in case.

00:15:28.060 --> 00:15:29.580
 (laughing)

00:15:29.580 --> 00:15:31.460
 But yeah, and the reason that they did this

00:15:31.460 --> 00:15:34.340
 is because this guy, a fair child,

00:15:34.340 --> 00:15:38.020
 had a nemesis called Charles Marlatt, didn't he?

00:15:38.020 --> 00:15:38.860
 - Yep.

00:15:38.860 --> 00:15:39.780
 - This is an amazing story.

00:15:39.780 --> 00:15:43.620
 So Charles Marlatt was in charge of the FDA

00:15:43.620 --> 00:15:47.860
 sort of anti-insect part of the FDA,

00:15:47.860 --> 00:15:49.180
 but they were boyhood friends.

00:15:49.180 --> 00:15:53.020
 And actually Marlatt was Fairchild's best man at his wedding.

00:15:53.020 --> 00:15:56.220
 But then they fell out because Fairchild basically got

00:15:56.220 --> 00:15:58.860
 a load of easy jobs through his friends and family,

00:15:58.860 --> 00:16:00.260
 he'll have a bit of nepotism and stuff.

00:16:00.260 --> 00:16:02.900
 And Marlatt had to work hard for his job.

00:16:02.900 --> 00:16:04.300
 And so they really fell out.

00:16:04.300 --> 00:16:06.940
 And Marlatt basically, whenever Fairchild brought in

00:16:06.940 --> 00:16:09.100
 any new species, he would be like,

00:16:09.100 --> 00:16:10.660
 "Does insects on that get rid of it?

00:16:10.660 --> 00:16:12.300
 "Burn it, do it now."

00:16:12.300 --> 00:16:13.780
 And so they really, really fell out.

00:16:13.780 --> 00:16:15.900
 - I have to defend the entomologist,

00:16:15.900 --> 00:16:17.020
 even though I love doing Fairchild.

00:16:17.020 --> 00:16:19.940
 So it's worth saying that like Fairchild,

00:16:19.940 --> 00:16:22.260
 he did get a lot of fame,

00:16:22.260 --> 00:16:23.540
 but a lot of that was off his own back.

00:16:23.540 --> 00:16:25.020
 But then, yeah, sure, he married into like

00:16:25.020 --> 00:16:26.140
 this really prominent family

00:16:26.140 --> 00:16:28.020
 and became really big with National Geographic.

00:16:28.020 --> 00:16:31.260
 But today, we would actually side with the entomologist.

00:16:31.260 --> 00:16:34.180
 Like, scientifically, he's the sound one.

00:16:34.180 --> 00:16:35.420
 Not the botanist just being like,

00:16:35.420 --> 00:16:37.020
 "Well, let's just hope it's gonna be fine

00:16:37.020 --> 00:16:39.340
 "when we bring all these parts from all over the world."

00:16:39.340 --> 00:16:40.180
 - Yeah, definitely.

00:16:40.180 --> 00:16:41.660
 - It was dangerous, yeah.

00:16:41.660 --> 00:16:43.940
 - I read this amazing story that he wanted to send

00:16:43.940 --> 00:16:47.860
 a thousand mangoes back to America,

00:16:47.860 --> 00:16:50.260
 but he put them on a boat and they were too heavy.

00:16:50.260 --> 00:16:54.100
 And so he solved it by getting a load of local children

00:16:54.100 --> 00:16:55.420
 to eat them all.

00:16:55.420 --> 00:16:56.260
 - What?

00:16:56.260 --> 00:16:57.740
 - Because all he needed were the stones.

00:16:57.740 --> 00:17:00.580
 He didn't need the mangoes themselves.

00:17:00.580 --> 00:17:02.500
 So he just got all the kids and said,

00:17:02.500 --> 00:17:04.260
 "Free mangoes as many as you can eat."

00:17:04.260 --> 00:17:05.420
 They all went, "Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no."

00:17:05.420 --> 00:17:06.980
 - U.S. diplomacy, there we go.

00:17:06.980 --> 00:17:07.820
 That's another...

00:17:07.820 --> 00:17:10.140
 - I thought you were gonna say something really clever,

00:17:10.140 --> 00:17:13.260
 like, "He only needed to ship the children there."

00:17:13.260 --> 00:17:15.140
 - And then they poo the mouse.

00:17:15.140 --> 00:17:16.340
 - Exactly, exactly.

00:17:16.340 --> 00:17:17.740
 And I was thinking, "Oh, those children are brave,

00:17:17.740 --> 00:17:18.820
 "like pooing at a mango stone.

00:17:18.820 --> 00:17:19.940
 "That's not funny."

00:17:19.940 --> 00:17:22.900
 No, children famously a bit more heavy than a mango as well.

00:17:22.900 --> 00:17:25.100
 So, wait was your issue.

00:17:25.100 --> 00:17:26.020
 - Oh, no.

00:17:26.020 --> 00:17:26.860
 I'm sorry.

00:17:26.860 --> 00:17:35.100
 - Okay, it's time for fact number two, and that is James.

00:17:35.100 --> 00:17:37.340
 - Okay, my fact this week is that up one stage

00:17:37.340 --> 00:17:41.420
 of the 17th century, every woman living on the Yemeni island

00:17:41.420 --> 00:17:43.780
 of Sokotra was called Maria.

00:17:43.780 --> 00:17:45.780
 - Was it?

00:17:45.780 --> 00:17:46.780
 Okay, okay.

00:17:46.780 --> 00:17:48.540
 - How many women were on the island?

00:17:48.540 --> 00:17:51.500
 - Well, I don't know, but it wasn't completely insignificant.

00:17:51.500 --> 00:17:52.460
 It's a big island, right?

00:17:52.460 --> 00:17:53.820
 It's about the size of what you've been there.

00:17:53.820 --> 00:17:54.660
 - Long Island.

00:17:54.660 --> 00:17:55.500
 - It's big, haven't you?

00:17:55.500 --> 00:17:56.340
 - Long Island, yeah, yeah.

00:17:56.340 --> 00:18:00.900
 - Is it that they were hosting a sound of music reality show?

00:18:00.900 --> 00:18:01.740
 - In the 17th century.

00:18:01.740 --> 00:18:02.820
 - Oh, yeah, yeah.

00:18:02.820 --> 00:18:04.620
 - I feel like it's a real Yemeni vibe.

00:18:04.620 --> 00:18:07.140
 It's like the tribesmen and the sound of music.

00:18:07.140 --> 00:18:10.900
 - Well, I don't know exactly how many people live there.

00:18:10.900 --> 00:18:12.780
 How many people do you say live there now?

00:18:12.780 --> 00:18:13.620
 It's in the 10, 10,000.

00:18:13.620 --> 00:18:15.020
 - I think it's about 40,000.

00:18:15.020 --> 00:18:16.380
 - 40,000, yeah.

00:18:16.380 --> 00:18:17.420
 It would have been less then,

00:18:17.420 --> 00:18:20.740
 but basically it was a Christian island.

00:18:20.740 --> 00:18:23.980
 By tradition, it was St. Thomas who was shipwrecked there

00:18:23.980 --> 00:18:25.780
 in the year 52 AD.

00:18:25.780 --> 00:18:27.540
 And he supposedly brought in Christianity,

00:18:27.540 --> 00:18:30.460
 but definitely the Greeks brought in the 4th century

00:18:30.460 --> 00:18:31.980
 that definitely happened.

00:18:31.980 --> 00:18:34.340
 And Marco Polo wrote about it in the 13th century

00:18:34.340 --> 00:18:35.660
 that there were Christians there.

00:18:35.660 --> 00:18:39.220
 And in the 17th century, there was a guy called Padre Vincenzo

00:18:39.220 --> 00:18:41.620
 and he visited Socatra.

00:18:41.620 --> 00:18:46.180
 And he found that they were still Christian ostensibly,

00:18:46.180 --> 00:18:48.860
 but they'd kind of moved to other beliefs

00:18:48.860 --> 00:18:51.940
 because Socatra is a place it's very difficult to get to,

00:18:51.940 --> 00:18:53.140
 especially at certain times of year,

00:18:53.140 --> 00:18:54.180
 you can't really get there at all.

00:18:54.180 --> 00:18:56.260
 - The monsoon is, yeah, good luck.

00:18:56.260 --> 00:18:58.500
 - And so because they were isolated

00:18:58.500 --> 00:19:00.580
 from the rest of the world,

00:19:00.580 --> 00:19:02.900
 they kind of had this new version of Christianity.

00:19:02.900 --> 00:19:05.540
 So a lot of them were called Maria.

00:19:05.540 --> 00:19:07.340
 There were still a lot of churches,

00:19:07.340 --> 00:19:09.820
 but for instance, they used to do sacrifices to the moon

00:19:09.820 --> 00:19:10.820
 and a few different things.

00:19:10.820 --> 00:19:12.420
 - Why not keep some of your old beliefs in?

00:19:12.420 --> 00:19:13.620
 Just spice it all up a bit.

00:19:13.620 --> 00:19:14.900
 What year was that again?

00:19:14.900 --> 00:19:17.100
 - It was in the mid 17th century.

00:19:17.100 --> 00:19:18.260
 - Why were they called Maria?

00:19:18.260 --> 00:19:20.620
 - Because Mary, the mother of Jesus.

00:19:20.620 --> 00:19:23.940
 - Oh, that must have been confusing.

00:19:23.940 --> 00:19:25.020
 - Oh, yeah. - No, 'cause they'd...

00:19:25.020 --> 00:19:25.860
 - Have you been there?

00:19:25.860 --> 00:19:27.540
 - Yeah, so I've been to Socatra.

00:19:27.540 --> 00:19:30.700
 It is, I can verify that it's very difficult to get there.

00:19:30.700 --> 00:19:31.980
 - Have you met a Maria?

00:19:31.980 --> 00:19:33.060
 - I have not met a Maria

00:19:33.060 --> 00:19:36.460
 'cause weirdly there's no Christians left on the island.

00:19:36.460 --> 00:19:38.180
 - Oh, what's that?

00:19:38.180 --> 00:19:39.820
 - Someone's had Maria, come on.

00:19:39.820 --> 00:19:43.380
 (all laughing)

00:19:43.380 --> 00:19:45.420
 - They're all Muslims now.

00:19:45.420 --> 00:19:49.140
 - So I went there kind of 2018, I think, or 2019.

00:19:49.140 --> 00:19:50.420
 And we had three options to get there.

00:19:50.420 --> 00:19:53.220
 Either we fly in via mainland Yemen,

00:19:53.220 --> 00:19:54.540
 but the airport we were flying into

00:19:54.540 --> 00:19:56.380
 was on Al Qaeda stronghold.

00:19:56.380 --> 00:19:59.620
 So decided maybe that's not the best way of getting in.

00:19:59.620 --> 00:20:02.380
 And then the other route was via,

00:20:02.380 --> 00:20:04.300
 kind of almost like a private jet via the Emirates,

00:20:04.300 --> 00:20:06.220
 the place that you like.

00:20:06.220 --> 00:20:09.140
 But they were only giving us verbal permission,

00:20:09.140 --> 00:20:10.660
 not written permission.

00:20:10.660 --> 00:20:14.540
 And then the third option was to get on a cement cargo ship

00:20:14.540 --> 00:20:17.820
 from Oman and sail through pirate waters.

00:20:17.820 --> 00:20:19.820
 And the ship was like infested with cockroaches,

00:20:19.820 --> 00:20:20.900
 like completely infested.

00:20:20.900 --> 00:20:23.620
 And it had like a, the toilet was like a basket

00:20:23.620 --> 00:20:25.380
 on the side of the ship, like attached with rope.

00:20:25.380 --> 00:20:26.220
 - Is this the route you went?

00:20:26.220 --> 00:20:27.060
 - Yeah. - Whoa.

00:20:27.060 --> 00:20:28.980
 - Yeah, it was hilarious.

00:20:28.980 --> 00:20:30.300
 - No pirates?

00:20:30.300 --> 00:20:33.860
 - Yeah, we luckily didn't have, you know.

00:20:33.860 --> 00:20:35.660
 The Swede in the group had his wits about him,

00:20:35.660 --> 00:20:36.620
 let me tell you that every time,

00:20:36.620 --> 00:20:41.100
 every time a ship went past you like just very nervous.

00:20:41.100 --> 00:20:43.340
 - But yeah, so it's really hard to get to

00:20:43.340 --> 00:20:44.180
 and that's the thing, right?

00:20:44.180 --> 00:20:45.980
 But then that's good news for other things.

00:20:45.980 --> 00:20:48.580
 So it means that they have amazing biodiversity there.

00:20:48.580 --> 00:20:50.260
 - Yeah, you've seen the trees there, there.

00:20:50.260 --> 00:20:51.420
 - They look incredible.

00:20:51.420 --> 00:20:52.460
 I mean, the dragonblood tree,

00:20:52.460 --> 00:20:54.460
 I know that's the most famous really,

00:20:54.460 --> 00:20:56.860
 that's the sort of like the headline tree out there,

00:20:56.860 --> 00:20:58.020
 but they do look beautiful.

00:20:58.020 --> 00:20:58.860
 - They're beautiful.

00:20:58.860 --> 00:20:59.700
 - They look, they're described,

00:20:59.700 --> 00:21:00.540
 if you'd want to picture it,

00:21:00.540 --> 00:21:02.220
 they're described as sort of looking like umbrellas.

00:21:02.220 --> 00:21:04.860
 But a lot of them look like umbrellas with a high wind

00:21:04.860 --> 00:21:07.420
 where you know when your umbrella flips on side out

00:21:07.420 --> 00:21:09.500
 'cause you see the stems coming up

00:21:09.500 --> 00:21:12.860
 and they're known for the fact that if the sap comes out,

00:21:12.860 --> 00:21:15.620
 it's red sap, hence the kind of dragonblood thing.

00:21:15.620 --> 00:21:17.420
 And they've been exporting that for years

00:21:17.420 --> 00:21:20.820
 and it's been used for all sorts of like nail polish

00:21:20.820 --> 00:21:23.060
 and medicines and so on.

00:21:23.060 --> 00:21:24.260
 - Smirring gladiators?

00:21:24.260 --> 00:21:25.100
 - Really? - Really?

00:21:25.100 --> 00:21:27.420
 - I think gladiators supposedly had a bit of it

00:21:27.420 --> 00:21:30.420
 to smear them as decoration and a bit as disinfectant.

00:21:30.420 --> 00:21:32.300
 But the thing is that the tree,

00:21:32.300 --> 00:21:34.180
 I think it only exists there now,

00:21:34.180 --> 00:21:37.020
 but pollen has been found all around the Mediterranean

00:21:37.020 --> 00:21:39.340
 as in fossilized or archeologists

00:21:39.340 --> 00:21:40.620
 have found pollen of it around the Med.

00:21:40.620 --> 00:21:43.100
 So this is what the Med used to look like.

00:21:43.100 --> 00:21:45.300
 There used to be these trees much more commonly.

00:21:45.300 --> 00:21:46.140
 - So the dragon's blood tree,

00:21:46.140 --> 00:21:48.620
 there's different species of dragon's blood.

00:21:48.620 --> 00:21:50.780
 And there are still what we call

00:21:50.780 --> 00:21:52.700
 in biology relic populations.

00:21:52.700 --> 00:21:55.540
 So kind of populations that are on their last leg in Socotra,

00:21:55.540 --> 00:21:57.620
 but there's different species of dragon's blood

00:21:57.620 --> 00:21:59.340
 in the Canary Islands.

00:21:59.340 --> 00:22:00.700
 There's another species in Ouan

00:22:00.700 --> 00:22:02.340
 and kind of a remote part of Oman.

00:22:02.340 --> 00:22:04.820
 And it looks like the dragon's blood tree

00:22:04.820 --> 00:22:07.580
 was like a really dominant tree

00:22:07.580 --> 00:22:10.980
 in the whole of kind of that old world.

00:22:10.980 --> 00:22:12.380
 It's kind of old school.

00:22:12.380 --> 00:22:14.860
 It should kind of really be on its out and it is.

00:22:14.860 --> 00:22:15.700
 - But it is right.

00:22:15.700 --> 00:22:17.380
 They're saying possibly in the next 80 years,

00:22:17.380 --> 00:22:18.220
 if we're not careful,

00:22:18.220 --> 00:22:21.100
 it's gonna be an extinct species of tree.

00:22:21.100 --> 00:22:22.780
 And it's so interesting how it survives

00:22:22.780 --> 00:22:25.140
 'cause most trees obviously get their water

00:22:25.140 --> 00:22:26.500
 through the roots under the ground.

00:22:26.500 --> 00:22:29.300
 But this tree has worked out a way.

00:22:29.300 --> 00:22:31.140
 I don't know if that's a language you use about trees,

00:22:31.140 --> 00:22:33.500
 but it's got the ability to take in the moisture

00:22:33.500 --> 00:22:35.180
 of the clouds that are going above it.

00:22:35.180 --> 00:22:38.220
 So it can pull from above as well as below,

00:22:38.220 --> 00:22:39.540
 which is pretty amazing.

00:22:39.540 --> 00:22:42.140
 - It injects much more water into the soil

00:22:42.140 --> 00:22:43.500
 from the air than it gets in rainfall.

00:22:43.500 --> 00:22:45.060
 'Cause sometimes it's foggy and cloudy

00:22:45.060 --> 00:22:46.620
 and it sort of sucks all that.

00:22:46.620 --> 00:22:48.980
 It's called horizontal precipitation capture,

00:22:48.980 --> 00:22:50.500
 which is as it sounds.

00:22:50.500 --> 00:22:53.540
 But they've got I think 92 different plant species

00:22:53.540 --> 00:22:54.660
 which live in the undergrowth.

00:22:54.660 --> 00:22:56.300
 The few surveys have found that.

00:22:56.300 --> 00:22:58.140
 And seven of them are only found

00:22:58.140 --> 00:23:00.260
 living in the undergrowth of the dragon's blood tree.

00:23:00.260 --> 00:23:01.300
 That's mad.

00:23:01.300 --> 00:23:02.140
 - That's so cool.

00:23:02.140 --> 00:23:04.180
 - I suppose that would make it an umbrella species.

00:23:04.180 --> 00:23:05.260
 It looks like an umbrella.

00:23:05.260 --> 00:23:06.100
 - Oh!

00:23:06.100 --> 00:23:09.060
 - I'll tell you what, at National Geographic,

00:23:09.060 --> 00:23:10.540
 they go wild for that long.

00:23:10.540 --> 00:23:11.380
 - Yeah, yeah.

00:23:11.380 --> 00:23:12.900
 - I mean, when you turn up there,

00:23:12.900 --> 00:23:15.260
 I'm not gonna lie, you're like, what is this place?

00:23:15.260 --> 00:23:17.300
 It looks, there's so few places on Earth

00:23:17.300 --> 00:23:18.140
 where you look at them and you go,

00:23:18.140 --> 00:23:19.740
 "Oh, that looks really alien."

00:23:19.740 --> 00:23:22.660
 Like that's a really unusual landscape.

00:23:22.660 --> 00:23:25.260
 And cicotra is definitely that, like these canyons,

00:23:25.260 --> 00:23:27.780
 like Grand Canyon or more obviously not that scale,

00:23:27.780 --> 00:23:29.740
 but with these dragon blood trees.

00:23:29.740 --> 00:23:31.100
 And other trees as well, you know,

00:23:31.100 --> 00:23:32.700
 and giant snails and a bunch of stuff

00:23:32.700 --> 00:23:34.220
 that you're just like, "What is this?"

00:23:34.220 --> 00:23:35.940
 - Well, Ella, I can ask you,

00:23:35.940 --> 00:23:37.700
 as the only one who's been there,

00:23:37.700 --> 00:23:40.700
 did it seem to you at all like the atmosphere

00:23:40.700 --> 00:23:45.700
 of the planet Pandora in the global mega hit avatar films?

00:23:45.700 --> 00:23:49.460
 - Okay, okay, actually this is a good crowd

00:23:49.460 --> 00:23:52.940
 to ask this because I've heard that as well,

00:23:52.940 --> 00:23:54.940
 but that was an inspiration.

00:23:54.940 --> 00:23:57.540
 And I wondered if we knew what the source of that was

00:23:57.540 --> 00:23:59.300
 because I could, here's the thing,

00:23:59.300 --> 00:24:00.780
 the thing with cicotra is,

00:24:00.780 --> 00:24:02.980
 if you speak to people that are really in the know,

00:24:02.980 --> 00:24:05.980
 so people, the kind of off the beat travelers,

00:24:05.980 --> 00:24:08.140
 people that are very interested in kind of biology,

00:24:08.140 --> 00:24:09.820
 that kind of thing, they all know cicotra.

00:24:09.820 --> 00:24:11.660
 It's like this hidden secret

00:24:11.660 --> 00:24:14.900
 that actually everybody in a certain industry knows about.

00:24:14.900 --> 00:24:17.020
 Like, you know, and it's on people's dreams.

00:24:17.020 --> 00:24:18.220
 I've met very rich people

00:24:18.220 --> 00:24:19.660
 that are desperate for me to take them to cicotra.

00:24:19.660 --> 00:24:21.860
 And I'm like, sure, once I've dealt with the pirate situation,

00:24:21.860 --> 00:24:23.900
 I will get you, and you're very rich.

00:24:23.900 --> 00:24:27.180
 - Cue of wizards Texans just waiting to be.

00:24:27.180 --> 00:24:28.780
 - But yeah, I wondered about that

00:24:28.780 --> 00:24:30.420
 because I was like, I can see that,

00:24:30.420 --> 00:24:31.940
 but I just wonder what the source is.

00:24:31.940 --> 00:24:34.580
 'Cause I just, being that we care about fact here, guys,

00:24:34.580 --> 00:24:35.420
 right? - Yeah.

00:24:35.420 --> 00:24:36.260
 - Right? - Yeah.

00:24:36.260 --> 00:24:37.100
 - Right? - Sure.

00:24:37.100 --> 00:24:37.940
 - I need more.

00:24:37.940 --> 00:24:39.020
 - Well, there's one thing we care about more than facts,

00:24:39.020 --> 00:24:40.220
 and that's the continued success

00:24:40.220 --> 00:24:42.300
 of the way of water franchise.

00:24:42.300 --> 00:24:44.180
 (laughing)

00:24:44.180 --> 00:24:45.220
 Nevermind, nevermind, nevermind.

00:24:45.220 --> 00:24:48.980
 - Just on the Christianity in Yemen in the 17th century,

00:24:48.980 --> 00:24:52.420
 this was what Padre Vincenza was talking about.

00:24:52.420 --> 00:24:53.860
 A few weird things that they did.

00:24:53.860 --> 00:24:56.700
 They had a priest called Adambo,

00:24:56.700 --> 00:24:58.620
 who was elected by the people

00:24:58.620 --> 00:25:00.340
 and changed every single year.

00:25:00.340 --> 00:25:03.820
 Just like almost like an archbishop of the island.

00:25:03.820 --> 00:25:05.420
 - But democratic. - But democratic.

00:25:05.420 --> 00:25:06.260
 That's quite cool, isn't it?

00:25:06.260 --> 00:25:07.100
 - Yeah, very cool.

00:25:07.100 --> 00:25:08.340
 - Let me tell you about modern day Yemen.

00:25:08.340 --> 00:25:10.300
 (laughing)

00:25:10.300 --> 00:25:12.060
 - The other thing is, in the churches,

00:25:12.060 --> 00:25:15.380
 they had like a, what would you call it, like an altar,

00:25:15.380 --> 00:25:18.100
 and every day they would smear it with butter.

00:25:18.100 --> 00:25:19.420
 - Oh, lovely.

00:25:19.420 --> 00:25:20.260
 - That does sound kind of--

00:25:20.260 --> 00:25:21.220
 - What for what reason?

00:25:21.220 --> 00:25:22.940
 - Yeah, do they slide along it?

00:25:22.940 --> 00:25:24.980
 (laughing)

00:25:24.980 --> 00:25:25.820
 'Cause that would be a great way

00:25:25.820 --> 00:25:27.020
 of starting a service, wouldn't it?

00:25:27.020 --> 00:25:28.860
 - You know, whoosh, I'm here.

00:25:28.860 --> 00:25:30.900
 - Was it sort of like, you're going up for your body of Christ?

00:25:30.900 --> 00:25:32.340
 Would you like some butter?

00:25:32.340 --> 00:25:33.300
 (laughing)

00:25:33.300 --> 00:25:34.860
 - I don't know how this is just the fantasies

00:25:34.860 --> 00:25:36.220
 of these two heathens.

00:25:36.220 --> 00:25:39.900
 That's what would take those two heathens back to church.

00:25:39.900 --> 00:25:41.340
 - I've got a general Yemen fact.

00:25:41.340 --> 00:25:42.460
 - Oh, yeah. - Yeah.

00:25:42.460 --> 00:25:44.180
 - During, so Yemen, I think,

00:25:44.180 --> 00:25:46.860
 used to be a British colony protectorate.

00:25:46.860 --> 00:25:47.700
 - Protectorate the south of it.

00:25:47.700 --> 00:25:49.340
 - That's safe to say about anywhere in the world.

00:25:49.340 --> 00:25:50.180
 - Yeah.

00:25:50.180 --> 00:25:51.020
 (laughing)

00:25:51.020 --> 00:25:53.700
 - The British were involved in something.

00:25:53.700 --> 00:25:54.860
 - Well, you know, yeah.

00:25:54.860 --> 00:25:58.780
 - So during that era, the port of Aden, which was,

00:25:58.780 --> 00:26:01.180
 and I think even after the rest of Yemen might have gained it,

00:26:01.180 --> 00:26:03.580
 it depends, Aden maintained a kind of special status.

00:26:03.580 --> 00:26:07.260
 Basically, Aden was in a pretty constant state of emergency.

00:26:07.260 --> 00:26:08.980
 Things were so dicey there

00:26:08.980 --> 00:26:10.700
 that British citizens living there were issued

00:26:10.700 --> 00:26:13.100
 pretty much as standard with revolvers

00:26:13.100 --> 00:26:15.540
 in case of assassination attempts on them.

00:26:15.540 --> 00:26:16.900
 Imagine that, imagine just moving to somewhere

00:26:16.900 --> 00:26:18.420
 and being fitted with a revolver.

00:26:18.420 --> 00:26:19.860
 - Yeah, Yemen's an interesting place.

00:26:19.860 --> 00:26:22.540
 Like, during, so there was a revolution

00:26:22.540 --> 00:26:24.060
 and obviously now there's a war.

00:26:24.060 --> 00:26:27.420
 And there was like a protest and outside the protest,

00:26:27.420 --> 00:26:29.460
 it says, "No bazookas."

00:26:29.460 --> 00:26:30.300
 (laughing)

00:26:30.300 --> 00:26:31.140
 - So you were allowed to...

00:26:31.140 --> 00:26:31.980
 - Wow.

00:26:31.980 --> 00:26:33.580
 (laughing)

00:26:33.580 --> 00:26:34.700
 - Other way, but just no bazookas.

00:26:34.700 --> 00:26:37.060
 We're drawing the line of, oh, and land mines.

00:26:37.060 --> 00:26:39.420
 They were like, "No bazookas and no hand grenades."

00:26:39.420 --> 00:26:40.260
 - Oh my God.

00:26:40.260 --> 00:26:41.100
 - That's so funny.

00:26:41.100 --> 00:26:42.420
 'Cause like, we just had protests here.

00:26:42.420 --> 00:26:43.740
 And if you brought like a...

00:26:43.740 --> 00:26:44.580
 - A whistle.

00:26:44.580 --> 00:26:45.980
 - A whistle or a luggage tag,

00:26:45.980 --> 00:26:48.020
 they'd kind of ship your way to prison.

00:26:48.020 --> 00:26:48.860
 - Yeah, no, no, no, no.

00:26:48.860 --> 00:26:50.660
 But in defense of my parents' home land,

00:26:50.660 --> 00:26:52.780
 I will say it is a,

00:26:52.780 --> 00:26:54.500
 have you seen pictures of mainland Yemen

00:26:54.500 --> 00:26:55.340
 and the island of Scotland?

00:26:55.340 --> 00:26:57.660
 It's the most stunning place.

00:26:57.660 --> 00:26:59.020
 And I know, like, I'm biased,

00:26:59.020 --> 00:27:01.140
 but it is absolutely absolutely beautiful.

00:27:01.140 --> 00:27:02.300
 - I saw a photo of a place.

00:27:02.300 --> 00:27:03.580
 I wonder if you've seen it in person.

00:27:03.580 --> 00:27:05.580
 You've been there quite a few times, right?

00:27:05.580 --> 00:27:07.620
 It's described as the Manhattan of the desert.

00:27:07.620 --> 00:27:08.460
 - Yes.

00:27:08.460 --> 00:27:09.300
 - I mean, it sounds incredible.

00:27:09.300 --> 00:27:11.620
 That was Freya Stark, explorer who called it that

00:27:11.620 --> 00:27:12.540
 in the 1930s.

00:27:12.540 --> 00:27:16.020
 But this is a 16th century walled city

00:27:16.020 --> 00:27:18.860
 that was the first ever city of skyscrapers.

00:27:18.860 --> 00:27:20.740
 They went seven floors high

00:27:20.740 --> 00:27:23.020
 and the buildings were made of mud.

00:27:23.020 --> 00:27:24.180
 It was just a mud trouble.

00:27:24.180 --> 00:27:25.020
 - And higher actually.

00:27:25.020 --> 00:27:25.860
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:27:25.860 --> 00:27:27.340
 - And there's still, obviously,

00:27:27.340 --> 00:27:29.140
 there's been renovations and so on,

00:27:29.140 --> 00:27:30.340
 but is there anything original?

00:27:30.340 --> 00:27:31.180
 - Oh, it's all there.

00:27:31.180 --> 00:27:33.500
 Yeah, so it's a UNESCO World Heritage Site.

00:27:33.500 --> 00:27:34.660
 Again, so it's,

00:27:34.660 --> 00:27:36.620
 so Sokotra is also a UNESCO World Heritage Site.

00:27:36.620 --> 00:27:38.500
 And it's basically buildings,

00:27:38.500 --> 00:27:40.580
 10, 11, whatever, stories high.

00:27:40.580 --> 00:27:43.660
 The really cute thing is that

00:27:43.660 --> 00:27:46.140
 some of those houses have bridges

00:27:46.140 --> 00:27:47.180
 on the top of the houses

00:27:47.180 --> 00:27:48.220
 because people can't be bothered

00:27:48.220 --> 00:27:49.140
 to go all the way downstairs.

00:27:49.140 --> 00:27:49.980
 'Cause I have elevators.

00:27:49.980 --> 00:27:52.180
 They're like, right, historic buildings, right?

00:27:52.180 --> 00:27:53.300
 So they, instead of going all the way

00:27:53.300 --> 00:27:54.500
 downstairs to go visit the neighbors,

00:27:54.500 --> 00:27:56.860
 they just go to the top,

00:27:56.860 --> 00:27:57.820
 which they call the drill band.

00:27:57.820 --> 00:28:00.380
 They just leg it along these little bridges.

00:28:00.380 --> 00:28:01.220
 - But the thing is, it's so old

00:28:01.220 --> 00:28:02.060
 and it's still inhabited.

00:28:02.060 --> 00:28:02.900
 That's the amazing.

00:28:02.900 --> 00:28:03.740
 - Oh, no, no, it's inhabited.

00:28:03.740 --> 00:28:04.700
 It's completely inhabited.

00:28:04.700 --> 00:28:06.420
 It's a lived in and World Heritage Site.

00:28:06.420 --> 00:28:07.260
 It's great.

00:28:07.260 --> 00:28:08.100
 I mean, when you turn up there,

00:28:08.100 --> 00:28:09.620
 you're like, are you kidding?

00:28:09.620 --> 00:28:12.260
 So bazookas and pistols, yes,

00:28:12.260 --> 00:28:14.020
 but also heritage.

00:28:14.020 --> 00:28:14.860
 - It was the...

00:28:14.860 --> 00:28:16.380
 - Go visit, guys.

00:28:16.380 --> 00:28:18.340
 - It was the only place you could get coffee from

00:28:18.340 --> 00:28:21.900
 for 200 years until one of these people

00:28:21.900 --> 00:28:24.180
 who stole plants went in.

00:28:24.180 --> 00:28:25.020
 (laughing)

00:28:25.020 --> 00:28:25.860
 - You're hero, Zala.

00:28:25.860 --> 00:28:27.580
 - Suddenly, I don't like them.

00:28:27.580 --> 00:28:29.860
 Went in, nicked all the coffee.

00:28:29.860 --> 00:28:32.500
 And if Mocha, which is the place

00:28:32.500 --> 00:28:34.620
 where the coffee was exported from,

00:28:34.620 --> 00:28:36.700
 if they still had the monopoly on coffee,

00:28:36.700 --> 00:28:38.620
 there would be enough money for everyone in Yemen

00:28:38.620 --> 00:28:41.380
 to get a payment of $16,000 per year

00:28:41.380 --> 00:28:42.540
 on top of anything else they earned.

00:28:42.540 --> 00:28:43.380
 - Are you kidding me?

00:28:43.380 --> 00:28:44.500
 - And that would be eight times higher

00:28:44.500 --> 00:28:47.380
 than the actual average salary of a person from Yemen.

00:28:47.380 --> 00:28:48.420
 - Wow.

00:28:48.420 --> 00:28:49.260
 - So yeah.

00:28:49.260 --> 00:28:53.660
 Just one more thing on Marys.

00:28:53.660 --> 00:28:54.500
 - Oh yeah.

00:28:54.500 --> 00:28:56.020
 - At the end of the 18th century,

00:28:56.020 --> 00:28:58.580
 24% of women in England were called Mary.

00:28:58.580 --> 00:29:01.500
 - The secotra of the North, so called it.

00:29:01.500 --> 00:29:02.660
 (laughing)

00:29:02.660 --> 00:29:04.980
 - And in Vexan, which is in France,

00:29:04.980 --> 00:29:06.900
 just Northwest of Paris,

00:29:06.900 --> 00:29:11.900
 in 1740, 68.4% of women were called Mary.

00:29:11.900 --> 00:29:13.140
 - What?

00:29:13.140 --> 00:29:15.140
 - Or Marie, it would be.

00:29:15.140 --> 00:29:17.620
 - Do any of you have Marys in your family?

00:29:17.620 --> 00:29:18.620
 - I have a cousin.

00:29:18.620 --> 00:29:20.700
 - Yeah, my, Rosemary is my auntie.

00:29:20.700 --> 00:29:22.180
 So there's, yeah, I wonder if it's that,

00:29:22.180 --> 00:29:23.260
 if it's the double barrel first.

00:29:23.260 --> 00:29:25.180
 - Well, in France, that's what happens.

00:29:25.180 --> 00:29:27.900
 So around that time, around the 18th century,

00:29:27.900 --> 00:29:29.740
 they started doing the double names,

00:29:29.740 --> 00:29:32.940
 so you could have Marie Claire or Marie, whatever.

00:29:32.940 --> 00:29:35.060
 And yeah, so they started almost,

00:29:35.060 --> 00:29:36.660
 everyone was called Marie something.

00:29:36.660 --> 00:29:37.660
 - Oh.

00:29:37.660 --> 00:29:42.460
 - In 1379, 33% of the male population of Sheffield

00:29:42.460 --> 00:29:46.620
 were called John, and 22% of the women were called Alice.

00:29:46.620 --> 00:29:49.860
 - John and Alice have invited us round.

00:29:49.860 --> 00:29:50.860
 - Be more specific!

00:29:50.860 --> 00:29:52.660
 (laughing)

00:29:52.660 --> 00:29:53.580
 - That's us!

00:29:53.580 --> 00:29:55.420
 (laughing)

00:29:55.420 --> 00:29:58.000
 (upbeat music)

00:29:58.000 --> 00:30:02.660
 - Okay, it is time for fact number three,

00:30:02.660 --> 00:30:04.820
 and that is Andy.

00:30:04.820 --> 00:30:06.820
 - My fact is that during the Second World War,

00:30:06.820 --> 00:30:09.060
 the making of Spitfires was so secret

00:30:09.060 --> 00:30:10.940
 that one married couple didn't know

00:30:10.940 --> 00:30:12.440
 they were both working on it.

00:30:12.440 --> 00:30:13.460
 - Was that John and Alice?

00:30:13.460 --> 00:30:14.980
 - It was John and Alice.

00:30:14.980 --> 00:30:15.820
 - That's cool.

00:30:15.820 --> 00:30:16.660
 - It's so weird.

00:30:16.660 --> 00:30:17.740
 - I wonder if they both thought

00:30:17.740 --> 00:30:19.180
 that the other was having enough.

00:30:19.180 --> 00:30:20.980
 - I know, imagine them going to work in the morning,

00:30:20.980 --> 00:30:22.620
 playing off to work.

00:30:22.620 --> 00:30:23.540
 - Yeah, me too.

00:30:23.540 --> 00:30:25.700
 - Okay. - See you later.

00:30:25.700 --> 00:30:26.860
 - I'm going in this direction.

00:30:26.860 --> 00:30:27.700
 - Oh.

00:30:27.700 --> 00:30:29.180
 (laughing)

00:30:29.180 --> 00:30:31.780
 - I'll just pop back to the house for a minute.

00:30:31.780 --> 00:30:32.960
 - Who's there somewhere at work,

00:30:32.960 --> 00:30:35.580
 whose job it was to keep them apart as well?

00:30:35.580 --> 00:30:38.060
 A nightmare life of the coming to the canteen

00:30:38.060 --> 00:30:38.900
 at the same time.

00:30:38.900 --> 00:30:41.140
 Oh, hey, what are you coming for?

00:30:42.260 --> 00:30:43.100
 - It's such a weird fact.

00:30:43.100 --> 00:30:44.520
 - How did they find out?

00:30:44.520 --> 00:30:45.360
 So many questions.

00:30:45.360 --> 00:30:46.600
 - They found out decades later.

00:30:46.600 --> 00:30:47.980
 That's the crazy thing.

00:30:47.980 --> 00:30:48.980
 So this is a slight--

00:30:48.980 --> 00:30:50.600
 - Was that the only secret thing they were working?

00:30:50.600 --> 00:30:51.440
 I have so many questions.

00:30:51.440 --> 00:30:52.720
 Was that the only secret thing they were working on?

00:30:52.720 --> 00:30:53.560
 - I think they were both working

00:30:53.560 --> 00:30:54.680
 in this specific factory.

00:30:54.680 --> 00:30:56.520
 - The same factory even?

00:30:56.520 --> 00:30:58.080
 - Yeah, it was the same factory, yeah, yeah.

00:30:58.080 --> 00:30:58.920
 But so this is--

00:30:58.920 --> 00:31:00.560
 - I mean, they might be idiots, guys.

00:31:00.560 --> 00:31:02.720
 (laughing)

00:31:02.720 --> 00:31:04.520
 - Basically, for anyone who doesn't know,

00:31:04.520 --> 00:31:05.680
 we're talking about the Spitfire,

00:31:05.680 --> 00:31:07.480
 the Super Marine Spitfires legendary plane

00:31:07.480 --> 00:31:10.360
 of the Second World War and big thing in Britain,

00:31:10.360 --> 00:31:13.300
 a kind of national myth item in Britain, the Spitfire.

00:31:13.300 --> 00:31:14.820
 And there was a factory in Southampton,

00:31:14.820 --> 00:31:17.100
 which made, I think, most of the Spitfires,

00:31:17.100 --> 00:31:19.820
 and it was bombed in 1940 by the Luftwaffe,

00:31:19.820 --> 00:31:21.460
 and it was not just bombed, it was flattened,

00:31:21.460 --> 00:31:23.180
 and this was a disaster.

00:31:23.180 --> 00:31:25.420
 And they needed to work out how to, you know,

00:31:25.420 --> 00:31:26.860
 keep Spitfire production going,

00:31:26.860 --> 00:31:28.460
 but keep it safe from bombing raids.

00:31:28.460 --> 00:31:29.700
 And what they did was they said,

00:31:29.700 --> 00:31:31.260
 well, we'll make it in secret.

00:31:31.260 --> 00:31:32.980
 And not only that, we'll divide all the factories

00:31:32.980 --> 00:31:35.420
 into, you know, lots of different tiny micro factories

00:31:35.420 --> 00:31:37.020
 around the place, which are all hidden.

00:31:37.020 --> 00:31:39.980
 So they used all sorts of little offices or garages,

00:31:39.980 --> 00:31:43.160
 a laundry, an old glove factory, they just divide,

00:31:43.160 --> 00:31:45.440
 it was amazing, they just divided it up.

00:31:45.440 --> 00:31:47.120
 And lots of them were in Salisbury and Reading

00:31:47.120 --> 00:31:49.840
 and Trowbridge and just like all over the place, basically.

00:31:49.840 --> 00:31:51.920
 And this came out decades after the war,

00:31:51.920 --> 00:31:54.200
 that this is how it had been done, basically.

00:31:54.200 --> 00:31:56.400
 And there was an engineer who worked on them

00:31:56.400 --> 00:31:58.680
 called Norman Parker, and he said in 2021,

00:31:58.680 --> 00:32:00.120
 he was interviewed about it.

00:32:00.120 --> 00:32:02.840
 He was about 95 at the time that he was talking about this.

00:32:02.840 --> 00:32:04.440
 He said, "We had one case, there was a couple

00:32:04.440 --> 00:32:06.160
 at a dinner party in the 1970s,

00:32:06.160 --> 00:32:07.880
 and over the dinner table, the wife said,

00:32:07.880 --> 00:32:11.020
 "Oh, I was building Spitfires in Salisbury during the war."

00:32:11.020 --> 00:32:14.260
 And the husband said, "No, you weren't, I was."

00:32:14.260 --> 00:32:16.020
 And they had both been working in the same factory

00:32:16.020 --> 00:32:16.860
 and they didn't know it.

00:32:16.860 --> 00:32:19.820
 - It could be a false memory, I guess.

00:32:19.820 --> 00:32:21.580
 - I think this is a really bad marriage, guys.

00:32:21.580 --> 00:32:22.420
 - Yeah.

00:32:22.420 --> 00:32:23.260
 - I've got-

00:32:23.260 --> 00:32:24.100
 - Well, there are a number of things

00:32:24.100 --> 00:32:25.540
 it could have been, but basically.

00:32:25.540 --> 00:32:27.020
 (laughing)

00:32:27.020 --> 00:32:27.860
 - Yeah.

00:32:27.860 --> 00:32:29.740
 - I reckon I have things with my siblings

00:32:29.740 --> 00:32:32.260
 that we talk about when we were really, really young.

00:32:32.260 --> 00:32:34.060
 And we all think that we were the one

00:32:34.060 --> 00:32:35.380
 who did a certain thing.

00:32:35.380 --> 00:32:36.220
 - Oh, right.

00:32:36.220 --> 00:32:37.060
 - Do you know what I mean?

00:32:37.060 --> 00:32:38.740
 - Yeah, I see, you're throwing shade on the-

00:32:38.740 --> 00:32:40.940
 - I'm not saying that's true, but I'm just saying,

00:32:40.940 --> 00:32:44.780
 I remember I was, my brother was locked in a toilet

00:32:44.780 --> 00:32:46.500
 in France when we went to a restaurant once

00:32:46.500 --> 00:32:47.420
 and we had to get him out.

00:32:47.420 --> 00:32:49.460
 And then he thinks it was my sister who was that.

00:32:49.460 --> 00:32:50.300
 Do you know what I mean?

00:32:50.300 --> 00:32:52.580
 So it's like, weirdo.

00:32:52.580 --> 00:32:53.620
 - Yeah, yeah.

00:32:53.620 --> 00:32:56.060
 - Or it could be that they're telling the truth

00:32:56.060 --> 00:32:57.100
 and it's a real thing.

00:32:57.100 --> 00:32:58.420
 (laughing)

00:32:58.420 --> 00:33:00.980
 - Do we know what they worked on specifically?

00:33:00.980 --> 00:33:01.980
 - Well, that's the other thing,

00:33:01.980 --> 00:33:03.900
 production was divvied up in lots of ways.

00:33:03.900 --> 00:33:06.080
 So it might have been by same factory.

00:33:06.080 --> 00:33:08.180
 It was a factory, it was at different sites

00:33:08.180 --> 00:33:10.500
 or it was a, you know, they probably weren't in the same room.

00:33:10.500 --> 00:33:12.220
 - He could have been making the leather chairs

00:33:12.220 --> 00:33:14.340
 for what could be used for a car, but it was for a plane.

00:33:14.340 --> 00:33:15.180
 And as in like-

00:33:15.180 --> 00:33:16.020
 - Sure, yeah, yeah.

00:33:16.020 --> 00:33:16.860
 - That's what I mean, to the level

00:33:16.860 --> 00:33:17.700
 of what were they making.

00:33:17.700 --> 00:33:18.540
 - Exactly, yeah.

00:33:18.540 --> 00:33:19.380
 - The spitfire.

00:33:19.380 --> 00:33:20.420
 - It's plausible, for sure.

00:33:20.420 --> 00:33:21.260
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:33:21.260 --> 00:33:22.100
 - I mean, it's-

00:33:22.100 --> 00:33:22.940
 - I think they sort of dug into it.

00:33:22.940 --> 00:33:23.780
 - And everyone was very secretive.

00:33:23.780 --> 00:33:24.620
 - And people were very secretive.

00:33:24.620 --> 00:33:26.420
 Or you might know in a couple,

00:33:26.420 --> 00:33:27.900
 I'm working on something that's secret

00:33:27.900 --> 00:33:29.580
 and I can't really tell you what it's about.

00:33:29.580 --> 00:33:31.620
 And they're both in war work.

00:33:31.620 --> 00:33:33.880
 And the thing is about aviation, during the Second World War,

00:33:33.880 --> 00:33:36.560
 65% of the aviation workforce were women

00:33:36.560 --> 00:33:38.100
 because most of the men were in the arm.

00:33:38.100 --> 00:33:40.800
 - So statistically, she's more likely to be correct.

00:33:40.800 --> 00:33:41.920
 - Absolutely, yeah.

00:33:41.920 --> 00:33:44.760
 Like I say, I think they're both correct.

00:33:44.760 --> 00:33:46.560
 - So she's told this guy at the dinner table,

00:33:46.560 --> 00:33:48.240
 he's gone, wow, what an amazing life.

00:33:48.240 --> 00:33:49.360
 What did you do?

00:33:49.360 --> 00:33:50.760
 Yeah, yes, spitfires as well.

00:33:50.760 --> 00:33:52.880
 (laughing)

00:33:52.880 --> 00:33:54.200
 - So anyway, the spitfire.

00:33:54.200 --> 00:33:55.280
 - Spitfire is amazing.

00:33:55.280 --> 00:33:56.880
 - So are you into the spitfire?

00:33:56.880 --> 00:33:57.720
 - Yeah.

00:33:57.720 --> 00:33:58.720
 - 'Cause I feel like I don't,

00:33:58.720 --> 00:34:01.080
 I feel, how do I put this politely?

00:34:01.080 --> 00:34:02.500
 - The people that talk about spitfires a lot

00:34:02.500 --> 00:34:04.560
 tend to be a few years older than you.

00:34:04.560 --> 00:34:05.560
 - Thank you.

00:34:05.560 --> 00:34:06.640
 That's actually a compliment guys.

00:34:06.640 --> 00:34:07.980
 I don't know if you heard that was,

00:34:07.980 --> 00:34:09.260
 (laughing)

00:34:09.260 --> 00:34:12.440
 I'm young seeming for a guy as interested in spitfires.

00:34:12.440 --> 00:34:14.400
 (laughing)

00:34:14.400 --> 00:34:17.280
 - Shit, my teacher at school when I was a kid,

00:34:17.280 --> 00:34:19.800
 was an older guy, was really into spitfires.

00:34:19.800 --> 00:34:21.960
 - I think actually, Ella, you'll find,

00:34:21.960 --> 00:34:23.920
 the more that you meet Andy and talk to him.

00:34:23.920 --> 00:34:24.760
 - He's an old man.

00:34:24.760 --> 00:34:26.340
 - Well, a lot of the things he's interested in,

00:34:26.340 --> 00:34:28.900
 you would expect older men to be interested in.

00:34:28.900 --> 00:34:29.740
 - Is that fair to say?

00:34:29.740 --> 00:34:31.100
 - I think it's not, I'm fair.

00:34:31.100 --> 00:34:33.220
 (laughing)

00:34:33.220 --> 00:34:35.820
 I'm not really, I'm not deeply into them,

00:34:35.820 --> 00:34:37.940
 but I am interested in logistics.

00:34:37.940 --> 00:34:40.300
 (laughing)

00:34:40.300 --> 00:34:41.540
 - So for those who can't see this,

00:34:41.540 --> 00:34:43.100
 he might be shaking a little bit.

00:34:43.100 --> 00:34:44.020
 (laughing)

00:34:44.020 --> 00:34:45.860
 I'm not really, really into it.

00:34:45.860 --> 00:34:47.040
 - I'm trembling with joy.

00:34:47.040 --> 00:34:47.880
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:34:47.880 --> 00:34:49.800
 I had a look at, just, you know,

00:34:49.800 --> 00:34:51.660
 we check what we've talked about before in this podcast.

00:34:51.660 --> 00:34:53.540
 I had a look, I can't believe you guys have stopped me

00:34:53.540 --> 00:34:56.100
 for nine years from ever mentioning the spitfire

00:34:56.100 --> 00:34:56.940
 on this show.

00:34:56.940 --> 00:34:57.780
 We've never mentioned that.

00:34:57.780 --> 00:34:58.620
 - Well done guys, high five for the rest of the day.

00:34:58.620 --> 00:35:00.340
 (laughing)

00:35:00.340 --> 00:35:01.180
 - Great place.

00:35:01.180 --> 00:35:03.260
 - Yeah, incredible plane and also,

00:35:03.260 --> 00:35:06.380
 what a group effort of the UK during wartime

00:35:06.380 --> 00:35:08.340
 to make this plane built to the numbers

00:35:08.340 --> 00:35:09.180
 that it was built at.

00:35:09.180 --> 00:35:11.540
 Basically, there was, I was reading an article saying

00:35:11.540 --> 00:35:14.580
 that it was effectively like one of the early kick starters

00:35:14.580 --> 00:35:16.260
 where people funded,

00:35:16.260 --> 00:35:19.020
 coal communities would go around funding single planes

00:35:19.020 --> 00:35:21.340
 and they, as a result, got to name the plane.

00:35:21.340 --> 00:35:23.740
 So lots of the planes flying that were in the war

00:35:23.740 --> 00:35:26.620
 had names like Dorothy of Great Britain and Empire

00:35:26.620 --> 00:35:29.540
 and that was funded entirely by women called Dorothy.

00:35:29.540 --> 00:35:32.700
 So, it's so, yes, it's so funny.

00:35:32.700 --> 00:35:33.540
 - Maria plane.

00:35:33.540 --> 00:35:35.540
 - Yeah, by the fact that 70% of women

00:35:35.540 --> 00:35:36.880
 were called Dorothy.

00:35:36.880 --> 00:35:38.300
 (laughing)

00:35:38.300 --> 00:35:41.180
 - There was the dog fighter as well.

00:35:41.180 --> 00:35:43.260
 There was, and that was the Kennel Club

00:35:43.260 --> 00:35:44.100
 who had funded that. - All right,

00:35:44.100 --> 00:35:45.540
 it wasn't people who did dog fighting.

00:35:45.540 --> 00:35:46.380
 (laughing)

00:35:46.380 --> 00:35:48.460
 Think for the back of the pub.

00:35:48.460 --> 00:35:51.100
 - But check this out, this is the most incredible one.

00:35:51.100 --> 00:35:54.220
 There was one that was POWs of Oflag.

00:35:54.220 --> 00:35:55.900
 This is a prison camp in Germany

00:35:55.900 --> 00:35:59.180
 with captured officers who donated their month's pay

00:35:59.180 --> 00:36:00.540
 through the Red Cross.

00:36:00.540 --> 00:36:02.700
 Then that went into the building of a plane.

00:36:02.700 --> 00:36:06.140
 So they were in prison and they were funding the plane.

00:36:06.140 --> 00:36:07.380
 - That was war actually.

00:36:07.380 --> 00:36:10.940
 - I read about that and they had to send letters back

00:36:10.940 --> 00:36:14.860
 saying I want to give my money to this crowdfunding, right?

00:36:14.860 --> 00:36:16.740
 But they had to do it in code.

00:36:16.740 --> 00:36:18.860
 So, because you couldn't send a message

00:36:18.860 --> 00:36:20.420
 that the Germans will be able to read saying,

00:36:20.420 --> 00:36:22.420
 please put all my money into spitfires.

00:36:22.420 --> 00:36:24.500
 Otherwise they're just gonna accidentally lose it, aren't they?

00:36:24.500 --> 00:36:26.220
 - Yeah, exactly. - It's amazing.

00:36:26.220 --> 00:36:27.860
 - It was, that was a really nice thing,

00:36:27.860 --> 00:36:30.100
 this crowdfunding effort, which I had not heard of.

00:36:30.100 --> 00:36:31.300
 - What would they have called it back then, though?

00:36:31.300 --> 00:36:32.260
 It wouldn't have been crowdfunding.

00:36:32.260 --> 00:36:34.540
 - They were called Spitfire Funds.

00:36:34.540 --> 00:36:36.980
 And the planes were kind of arbitrarily priced.

00:36:36.980 --> 00:36:38.780
 They said 5,000 pounds will buy a Spitfire,

00:36:38.780 --> 00:36:40.140
 which was not actually a true figure,

00:36:40.140 --> 00:36:41.940
 but it sort of was a peg for people too.

00:36:41.940 --> 00:36:43.660
 - But also that thing of charities,

00:36:43.660 --> 00:36:44.500
 these days they would say,

00:36:44.500 --> 00:36:46.860
 two pounds will buy a meal for one person.

00:36:46.860 --> 00:36:48.820
 - Yeah, it was like six pounds will buy a rivet.

00:36:48.820 --> 00:36:49.900
 - Exactly. - And 2,000 pounds

00:36:49.900 --> 00:36:50.740
 will get you a wing.

00:36:50.740 --> 00:36:51.580
 - No.

00:36:51.580 --> 00:36:53.060
 - So you can see what you were buying.

00:36:53.060 --> 00:36:54.980
 - They raised a lot of money.

00:36:54.980 --> 00:36:56.940
 It was nearly given a much less sexy name

00:36:56.940 --> 00:36:57.780
 than the Spitfire.

00:36:57.780 --> 00:36:59.740
 Spitfire's quite a swashbuckling name.

00:36:59.740 --> 00:37:03.340
 Other contenders included Scarab, Shrike,

00:37:03.340 --> 00:37:04.860
 which is quite good, 'cause that's a bird

00:37:04.860 --> 00:37:07.740
 that impales its prey, and it's quite sort of...

00:37:07.740 --> 00:37:10.380
 But I looked up the complete list of Super Marine aircraft,

00:37:10.380 --> 00:37:12.540
 and there were some many bad options

00:37:12.540 --> 00:37:14.260
 that the Spitfire could have been called.

00:37:14.260 --> 00:37:16.860
 There was the Super Marine Commercial Amphibian,

00:37:16.860 --> 00:37:18.780
 the Super Marine Sea Urchin,

00:37:18.780 --> 00:37:20.980
 Super Marine Spiteful, quite good,

00:37:20.980 --> 00:37:24.260
 the Super Marine Seagull, Super Marine Sea Otter.

00:37:24.260 --> 00:37:25.940
 - No, no, no, they're taking the...

00:37:25.940 --> 00:37:29.020
 - No, they're a rip, and the Super Marine Baby.

00:37:29.020 --> 00:37:30.580
 - Oh, yeah. - Oh, yeah.

00:37:30.580 --> 00:37:31.580
 - I know. - In a brainstorm,

00:37:31.580 --> 00:37:33.220
 sometimes there are bad ideas.

00:37:33.220 --> 00:37:35.780
 - Unleash the babies, yeah, yeah.

00:37:35.780 --> 00:37:36.740
 But they mostly began with this,

00:37:36.740 --> 00:37:38.100
 and they were mostly sea planes.

00:37:38.100 --> 00:37:39.180
 That's what they started out as,

00:37:39.180 --> 00:37:41.900
 the firm started out making sea planes and so, yeah.

00:37:41.900 --> 00:37:44.620
 - I love sea planes. - Yeah, they're cool.

00:37:44.620 --> 00:37:47.980
 - Imagine they're a plane where you can just land anywhere.

00:37:47.980 --> 00:37:50.260
 As long as there's a body of water, you just land.

00:37:50.260 --> 00:37:51.340
 - So not on land.

00:37:51.340 --> 00:37:52.660
 - Yeah, well, yeah.

00:37:52.660 --> 00:37:54.460
 - No, no, no, no, sorry.

00:37:54.460 --> 00:37:55.780
 - I'm sorry.

00:37:55.780 --> 00:37:57.380
 - Dan suddenly brings the facts.

00:37:57.380 --> 00:37:59.900
 - You get special life jackets in case you land on land.

00:37:59.900 --> 00:38:01.380
 - Yeah, yeah, exactly.

00:38:01.380 --> 00:38:06.100
 - These Super Marine Spitfires,

00:38:06.100 --> 00:38:08.060
 when they were taxiing,

00:38:08.060 --> 00:38:10.900
 so just kind of driving around the airport,

00:38:10.900 --> 00:38:12.780
 they were quite often sort of,

00:38:12.780 --> 00:38:15.060
 not overturned, but get really wobbly.

00:38:15.060 --> 00:38:17.220
 And so what would happen is someone would often sit

00:38:17.220 --> 00:38:19.940
 on the tail of the plane to keep them steady,

00:38:19.940 --> 00:38:21.740
 and it was often a woman who did this,

00:38:21.740 --> 00:38:24.380
 and there was a particular woman called Margaret Horton

00:38:24.380 --> 00:38:28.380
 who did this in 1943 at RAF, Heibaldstow,

00:38:28.380 --> 00:38:29.980
 and she was sat on the back

00:38:29.980 --> 00:38:32.380
 and the guy was a little bit anxious to get in the air

00:38:32.380 --> 00:38:34.060
 and forgot to get her off the tail.

00:38:34.060 --> 00:38:35.340
 - No, no, no.

00:38:35.340 --> 00:38:36.940
 - So started taking off

00:38:36.940 --> 00:38:39.820
 while she was sitting on the tail of the Spitfire.

00:38:39.820 --> 00:38:43.900
 And he radioed down to traffic controls saying,

00:38:43.900 --> 00:38:46.060
 there's something wrong with this plane.

00:38:46.060 --> 00:38:48.300
 It's kind of really heavy.

00:38:48.980 --> 00:38:50.820
 - And so they talked him down,

00:38:50.820 --> 00:38:54.300
 but they never told him that there was a woman on the back.

00:38:54.300 --> 00:38:55.420
 - Oh, no way.

00:38:55.420 --> 00:38:57.220
 - Well, because as soon as they tell him,

00:38:57.220 --> 00:38:58.060
 he's gonna be--

00:38:58.060 --> 00:38:58.900
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:38:58.900 --> 00:38:59.740
 - So true.

00:38:59.740 --> 00:39:01.620
 - So they're like, oh yeah, there's obviously a problem

00:39:01.620 --> 00:39:04.060
 with the wing, we'll just talk you down on how to get down.

00:39:04.060 --> 00:39:06.700
 And so he never knew until he landed that this woman was--

00:39:06.700 --> 00:39:07.540
 - Bloody hell.

00:39:07.540 --> 00:39:08.860
 - And she survived.

00:39:08.860 --> 00:39:10.180
 - She survived, yeah, yeah.

00:39:10.180 --> 00:39:11.020
 - She survived.

00:39:11.020 --> 00:39:14.060
 There's a museum called Tagmeer Military Aviation Museum.

00:39:14.060 --> 00:39:15.380
 And when you go to it,

00:39:15.380 --> 00:39:16.780
 there's a model that they've made.

00:39:16.780 --> 00:39:19.460
 So you can see a model of a Spitfire taking off

00:39:19.460 --> 00:39:20.300
 with this woman.

00:39:20.300 --> 00:39:22.300
 - A little plasticine woman

00:39:22.300 --> 00:39:24.820
 or whatever the material is holding on the tail wing.

00:39:24.820 --> 00:39:26.140
 - It's so funny.

00:39:26.140 --> 00:39:27.460
 - It's so brilliant.

00:39:27.460 --> 00:39:30.620
 - Should we say why it was so good?

00:39:30.620 --> 00:39:32.140
 - I'm intrigued, yeah.

00:39:32.140 --> 00:39:34.380
 So apparently all the pilots loved it,

00:39:34.380 --> 00:39:36.660
 but I'm like, why, why did they all love it?

00:39:36.660 --> 00:39:38.460
 - Well, it was really nimble.

00:39:38.460 --> 00:39:40.260
 It turned very, very fast.

00:39:40.260 --> 00:39:41.860
 And also the other thing about it was,

00:39:41.860 --> 00:39:43.060
 it was, you know, it's like,

00:39:43.060 --> 00:39:45.740
 if you guys want to tease me when I say this bit,

00:39:45.740 --> 00:39:46.580
 I don't mind, right?

00:39:46.580 --> 00:39:50.700
 But basically they had flush riveting, which is a good--

00:39:50.700 --> 00:39:52.020
 (laughing)

00:39:52.020 --> 00:39:54.780
 Okay, talk amongst yourselves.

00:39:54.780 --> 00:39:56.220
 Dear listener.

00:39:56.220 --> 00:39:59.460
 No, so metal skin, very, very cool.

00:39:59.460 --> 00:40:01.260
 But if you had lumpy rivets all over it,

00:40:01.260 --> 00:40:02.780
 which most planes did before that,

00:40:02.780 --> 00:40:04.820
 it drags the plane back a bit.

00:40:04.820 --> 00:40:07.340
 Whereas if you sink, you use the little countersunk rivets,

00:40:07.340 --> 00:40:09.420
 so you can see where it's going to go.

00:40:09.420 --> 00:40:10.860
 So it's like, what's going on?

00:40:10.860 --> 00:40:12.740
 If you sink, you use the little countersunk rivets,

00:40:12.740 --> 00:40:14.500
 so you sort of, it's exactly level

00:40:14.500 --> 00:40:15.740
 with the surface of the plane,

00:40:15.740 --> 00:40:17.620
 then the airflow is very efficient

00:40:17.620 --> 00:40:19.180
 and you get a much faster plane.

00:40:19.180 --> 00:40:21.380
 And they did some experiments on early spitfires.

00:40:21.380 --> 00:40:22.740
 They replicated what it would be like

00:40:22.740 --> 00:40:26.020
 if it had external rivets by gluing split peas

00:40:26.020 --> 00:40:28.380
 onto the spots where the rivets were all over the plane

00:40:28.380 --> 00:40:31.140
 and then flying it, doing a speed test, basically.

00:40:31.140 --> 00:40:33.980
 And it was about 20, 22 miles an hour slower.

00:40:33.980 --> 00:40:35.820
 It was a fair chunk slower,

00:40:35.820 --> 00:40:37.340
 which would have had a serious effect

00:40:37.340 --> 00:40:39.820
 if you were in a combat situation, you know.

00:40:39.820 --> 00:40:40.660
 So yeah.

00:40:40.660 --> 00:40:42.900
 - Couldn't you have stopped the enemy

00:40:42.900 --> 00:40:45.580
 by going in and putting peas on his plane?

00:40:45.580 --> 00:40:46.420
 - Definitely.

00:40:46.420 --> 00:40:50.420
 That was a big part of the early SIS job was, yeah.

00:40:50.420 --> 00:40:52.220
 - I used to do that and so did my wife.

00:40:52.220 --> 00:40:53.300
 (laughing)

00:40:53.300 --> 00:40:56.060
 - So that fact would be even more impressive

00:40:56.060 --> 00:40:57.700
 if I knew what a rivet was.

00:40:57.700 --> 00:40:59.820
 (hissing)

00:40:59.820 --> 00:41:00.660
 - Yeah.

00:41:00.660 --> 00:41:03.860
 Well, you've got to retain some mystery, I'm afraid.

00:41:03.860 --> 00:41:06.060
 - That's still under the secrets act, actually.

00:41:06.060 --> 00:41:07.500
 - What the hell's a rivet?

00:41:07.500 --> 00:41:09.220
 - A kind of screw, kind of screw.

00:41:09.220 --> 00:41:10.220
 - Like a big old screw.

00:41:10.220 --> 00:41:11.940
 - It joins the bits of the plane

00:41:11.940 --> 00:41:12.780
 to the other bits of the plane.

00:41:12.780 --> 00:41:14.540
 - I'm googling rivet.

00:41:14.540 --> 00:41:15.380
 - That's so funny.

00:41:15.380 --> 00:41:16.740
 - You know the word riveting?

00:41:16.740 --> 00:41:18.560
 It's got nothing to do with what a rivet is.

00:41:18.560 --> 00:41:19.700
 (laughing)

00:41:19.700 --> 00:41:20.780
 - Hold on, rivet.

00:41:20.780 --> 00:41:21.620
 Just googling.

00:41:21.620 --> 00:41:24.620
 - 'Cause it holds you together, it holds you in place.

00:41:24.620 --> 00:41:25.780
 Yeah, you're right.

00:41:25.780 --> 00:41:28.420
 - This is, yeah, they're just, it's a kind of screw.

00:41:28.420 --> 00:41:30.100
 - Yeah, yeah, basically, yeah.

00:41:30.100 --> 00:41:33.260
 - Message in if you didn't know what a rivet was.

00:41:33.260 --> 00:41:35.420
 - And if you like, I can repeat that fact for you now.

00:41:35.420 --> 00:41:38.020
 And it'll be even more exciting this time round.

00:41:38.980 --> 00:41:40.180
 - Shouldn't be that, though.

00:41:40.180 --> 00:41:41.720
 - Yeah, I'll just quickly mention.

00:41:41.720 --> 00:41:42.560
 - What?

00:41:42.560 --> 00:41:43.380
 (laughing)

00:41:43.380 --> 00:41:44.460
 - I feel like we've got it now.

00:41:44.460 --> 00:41:46.380
 I've read a tenth of my stuff out.

00:41:46.380 --> 00:41:48.860
 I haven't told you about the Super Marine Walrus.

00:41:48.860 --> 00:41:50.020
 - So it's just not of interest.

00:41:50.020 --> 00:41:52.020
 Like, what are your subjects that they won't let you

00:41:52.020 --> 00:41:52.860
 normally talk about?

00:41:52.860 --> 00:41:55.700
 I just need to know, like, how valid.

00:41:55.700 --> 00:41:57.220
 - It's mostly second-world war logistic.

00:41:57.220 --> 00:41:59.460
 - Yeah, we end up letting him do it

00:41:59.460 --> 00:42:02.140
 because he does crowbar it in somehow into any old fact.

00:42:02.140 --> 00:42:03.340
 - So it is a question for you.

00:42:03.340 --> 00:42:07.700
 Do you follow current war strategy and logistics?

00:42:07.700 --> 00:42:09.500
 Like, I've got a whole bunch of male friends

00:42:09.500 --> 00:42:12.460
 who are so into the logistics of the Ukrainian war

00:42:12.460 --> 00:42:15.700
 that it's gone beyond anything that I think is normal.

00:42:15.700 --> 00:42:18.540
 - You'd have to ask my wife what's normal

00:42:18.540 --> 00:42:21.460
 in terms of what--

00:42:21.460 --> 00:42:23.100
 - It's past and present.

00:42:23.100 --> 00:42:25.140
 - I think logistics is interesting.

00:42:25.140 --> 00:42:27.380
 (laughing)

00:42:27.380 --> 00:42:32.020
 And I'm not, I'm blushing now, but actually,

00:42:32.020 --> 00:42:32.860
 I'm not ashamed.

00:42:32.860 --> 00:42:35.500
 - Logistics is interesting, needs to go on your tombstone.

00:42:35.500 --> 00:42:38.860
 - We can't all be, we can't all be bloody explorers, you know,

00:42:38.860 --> 00:42:40.500
 on cool cement ships.

00:42:40.500 --> 00:42:41.820
 I'm gonna stay on the cement ship.

00:42:41.820 --> 00:42:43.060
 Thank you, I don't wanna see Sokotra.

00:42:43.060 --> 00:42:45.140
 - Look at the rivets on Andy's tombstone.

00:42:45.140 --> 00:42:47.580
 (laughing)

00:42:47.580 --> 00:42:48.900
 - Oh, dear.

00:42:48.900 --> 00:42:52.340
 - We've been so mean.

00:42:52.340 --> 00:42:53.180
 - No, no.

00:42:53.180 --> 00:42:54.620
 - Look, some people need to be in logistics.

00:42:54.620 --> 00:42:55.460
 Just--

00:42:55.460 --> 00:42:56.300
 - Well, actually, James is right.

00:42:56.300 --> 00:42:58.700
 We're not actually out of time, but we should move on.

00:42:58.700 --> 00:43:00.020
 - Oh, can I tell you, can I tell you one more?

00:43:00.020 --> 00:43:02.220
 Like, sort of, Spitfire here,

00:43:02.220 --> 00:43:04.380
 he actually wrote a book partly about the Spitfire.

00:43:04.380 --> 00:43:05.300
 Douglas Bader?

00:43:05.300 --> 00:43:06.140
 - Yeah.

00:43:06.140 --> 00:43:06.960
 - Yeah, yeah.

00:43:06.960 --> 00:43:08.060
 - He was a really famous pilot,

00:43:08.060 --> 00:43:09.860
 partly because I think it was in,

00:43:09.860 --> 00:43:10.700
 I don't know if it was an accident.

00:43:10.700 --> 00:43:11.900
 - But he famously had no legs.

00:43:11.900 --> 00:43:12.740
 - He had no legs.

00:43:12.740 --> 00:43:13.940
 But he nonetheless--

00:43:13.940 --> 00:43:15.900
 - He almost lost his legs during mission flight.

00:43:15.900 --> 00:43:18.060
 - Yeah, flying accident, yeah, yeah, flying incidents.

00:43:18.060 --> 00:43:20.300
 And he became a Spitfire ace nonetheless.

00:43:20.300 --> 00:43:22.460
 In the Second World War, he was shot down over France,

00:43:22.460 --> 00:43:24.640
 and he ejected, so he survived,

00:43:24.640 --> 00:43:26.340
 but he lost one of his prosthetic legs

00:43:26.340 --> 00:43:28.620
 in the course of being shot down.

00:43:28.620 --> 00:43:30.580
 Well, no, he was treated with a lot of respect

00:43:30.580 --> 00:43:32.260
 by the Germans who captured him,

00:43:32.260 --> 00:43:34.100
 because there were rules about that.

00:43:34.100 --> 00:43:35.880
 And he was in a prisoner of war camp.

00:43:35.880 --> 00:43:38.100
 And Göring, who was the head of the Luftwaffe,

00:43:38.100 --> 00:43:41.620
 gave special permission for an artificial leg,

00:43:41.620 --> 00:43:45.100
 a spare leg to be parachuted into his prisoner of war camp.

00:43:45.100 --> 00:43:45.940
 - Amazing.

00:43:45.940 --> 00:43:46.780
 - Yeah.

00:43:46.780 --> 00:43:47.620
 - I think what happened was, though,

00:43:47.620 --> 00:43:49.100
 he kept trying to escape,

00:43:49.100 --> 00:43:51.980
 and so they confiscated his prosthetic in the end.

00:43:51.980 --> 00:43:53.380
 - Yes, they did, yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:43:53.380 --> 00:43:55.500
 That was before the relationship started, I guess.

00:43:55.500 --> 00:43:56.340
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:43:56.340 --> 00:43:57.980
 And that was called Operation Leg.

00:43:57.980 --> 00:43:58.820
 - Nice.

00:43:58.820 --> 00:44:00.260
 - Where do they come up with their legs?

00:44:00.260 --> 00:44:02.940
 (all laughing)

00:44:02.940 --> 00:44:04.500
 - There's one other hero we should mention,

00:44:04.500 --> 00:44:06.020
 which is Lady Houston.

00:44:06.020 --> 00:44:07.700
 Lady Houston's sort of the reason

00:44:07.700 --> 00:44:11.420
 that the Spitfire became the Spitfire during the war.

00:44:11.420 --> 00:44:14.100
 She was a suffrager, political activist.

00:44:14.100 --> 00:44:17.020
 She also was one of the richest women in the UK,

00:44:17.020 --> 00:44:18.900
 if not the richest at one point.

00:44:18.900 --> 00:44:22.100
 And she was someone who kept helping out with war efforts.

00:44:22.100 --> 00:44:23.420
 She was always donating things.

00:44:23.420 --> 00:44:26.940
 - I think the war people didn't like her very much, right?

00:44:26.940 --> 00:44:27.780
 - That's right.

00:44:27.780 --> 00:44:30.300
 - Because she kept saying that they weren't giving

00:44:30.300 --> 00:44:32.260
 enough money to the war effort.

00:44:32.260 --> 00:44:33.700
 They weren't giving enough equipment,

00:44:33.700 --> 00:44:34.740
 all that kind of stuff.

00:44:34.740 --> 00:44:36.700
 And she would go around with placards saying,

00:44:36.700 --> 00:44:38.380
 "Give them more guns," kind of thing.

00:44:38.380 --> 00:44:39.460
 And they got really annoyed.

00:44:39.460 --> 00:44:42.260
 But she did get a lot of money together.

00:44:42.260 --> 00:44:44.420
 And I think, are you gonna say that she helped

00:44:44.420 --> 00:44:46.540
 to pay for the design of the Spitfire?

00:44:46.540 --> 00:44:47.660
 - Yeah, basically what it was,

00:44:47.660 --> 00:44:49.260
 was there was a thing called the Snyder Trophy,

00:44:49.260 --> 00:44:52.380
 which was a biannual international airspeed race.

00:44:52.380 --> 00:44:54.260
 And Britain won it twice.

00:44:54.260 --> 00:44:56.060
 And the idea was if they won the third one,

00:44:56.060 --> 00:44:57.820
 they would get to keep the trophy for good.

00:44:57.820 --> 00:44:59.020
 But at this point, the government said,

00:44:59.020 --> 00:45:00.460
 "We're not gonna fund this stuff.

00:45:00.460 --> 00:45:01.780
 "We need all the money."

00:45:01.780 --> 00:45:03.180
 And she thought that was a huge mistake.

00:45:03.180 --> 00:45:04.460
 - It was seen as a bit of a like,

00:45:04.460 --> 00:45:06.660
 "This is a crazy wonder weapon idea.

00:45:06.660 --> 00:45:09.060
 "It's not gonna, like this is a mad waste of money."

00:45:09.060 --> 00:45:10.300
 - It was in a depression.

00:45:10.300 --> 00:45:11.140
 It was, yeah.

00:45:11.140 --> 00:45:13.300
 - This was in like late 20s, early 30s.

00:45:13.300 --> 00:45:14.540
 This was before.

00:45:14.540 --> 00:45:15.380
 - Exactly.

00:45:15.380 --> 00:45:18.060
 And so she said, "Well, no, that shouldn't be the case."

00:45:18.060 --> 00:45:19.020
 So she funded it.

00:45:19.020 --> 00:45:21.020
 She funded it for it to go ahead.

00:45:21.020 --> 00:45:23.820
 And as a result, Rolls-Royce developed a new engine

00:45:23.820 --> 00:45:25.740
 that became Spitfire's engine and so on.

00:45:25.740 --> 00:45:28.940
 So it was down to her and making that happen.

00:45:28.940 --> 00:45:31.900
 She was the wizened old Texan of her day.

00:45:31.900 --> 00:45:33.020
 - Yeah, she was.

00:45:33.020 --> 00:45:33.860
 - Exactly.

00:45:33.860 --> 00:45:36.060
 - They're wonderful.

00:45:36.060 --> 00:45:37.860
 Let me tell you, if you've got some money,

00:45:37.860 --> 00:45:38.980
 lose some of it with me.

00:45:38.980 --> 00:45:39.820
 It's fine.

00:45:39.820 --> 00:45:42.460
 - We also have a Patreon just to say.

00:45:42.460 --> 00:45:44.820
 - Dammit.

00:45:44.820 --> 00:45:53.020
 - Okay, it's time for our final fact of the show.

00:45:53.020 --> 00:45:54.220
 And that is my fact.

00:45:54.220 --> 00:45:57.700
 My fact this week is that one of the original names proposed

00:45:57.700 --> 00:46:01.700
 for what we now know as Neanderthals was Homo Stupidus.

00:46:01.700 --> 00:46:05.380
 - Brilliant.

00:46:05.380 --> 00:46:07.340
 - Yeah, so this was in the early days

00:46:07.340 --> 00:46:10.380
 when we were finding skulls of what was then thought like,

00:46:10.380 --> 00:46:11.300
 is this a bear?

00:46:11.300 --> 00:46:14.580
 Is this a sort of just like, no one knew what it's a plane.

00:46:14.580 --> 00:46:18.180
 There was a point where we were finding lots of skulls

00:46:18.180 --> 00:46:20.020
 and we didn't quite know what this thing was.

00:46:20.020 --> 00:46:22.500
 It would later turn out to be Neanderthals.

00:46:22.500 --> 00:46:25.420
 And when they got to a point where they were thinking,

00:46:25.420 --> 00:46:27.900
 "Okay, actually we do have a new different species

00:46:27.900 --> 00:46:29.940
 of Homo here, we need to give it a name."

00:46:29.940 --> 00:46:31.980
 But by the look of it and by the skeletons that have been

00:46:31.980 --> 00:46:35.060
 found, it looked like a very clumsy, bulky idiot.

00:46:35.060 --> 00:46:39.860
 And so a very famous scientist at the time, Ernest Haeckel,

00:46:39.860 --> 00:46:42.460
 suggested, why not call it Homo Stupidus,

00:46:42.460 --> 00:46:46.220
 to really dig home that this is why this moron

00:46:46.220 --> 00:46:48.420
 is no longer existing on our planet.

00:46:48.420 --> 00:46:50.580
 Now we now know that this is completely wrong,

00:46:50.580 --> 00:46:53.100
 that Neanderthals were actually very intelligent.

00:46:53.100 --> 00:46:56.260
 They did art, they could sing, perhaps.

00:46:56.260 --> 00:46:57.540
 There's lots of things that we're discovering

00:46:57.540 --> 00:46:58.380
 more and more about them.

00:46:58.380 --> 00:47:02.140
 They used penicillin even, like a whole version of penicillin.

00:47:02.140 --> 00:47:03.460
 - I mean, prehistoric version.

00:47:03.460 --> 00:47:04.780
 - Prehistoric, yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:47:04.780 --> 00:47:05.620
 - Not over the counter stuff.

00:47:05.620 --> 00:47:06.460
 - Sure.

00:47:06.460 --> 00:47:07.300
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:47:07.300 --> 00:47:09.260
 But you're a Neanderthal expert, Ella.

00:47:09.260 --> 00:47:11.060
 - So I have a number of questions.

00:47:11.060 --> 00:47:12.060
 One is...

00:47:12.060 --> 00:47:13.820
 - I feel we're doing this the wrong way around.

00:47:13.820 --> 00:47:15.540
 (all laughing)

00:47:15.540 --> 00:47:17.460
 - No, this is definitely targeted at you three.

00:47:17.460 --> 00:47:19.180
 So when you have the guest on,

00:47:19.180 --> 00:47:21.620
 are the topics always consistently the topics

00:47:21.620 --> 00:47:22.900
 that they are specialists in?

00:47:22.900 --> 00:47:24.700
 And if so, why did I get a spitfire?

00:47:24.700 --> 00:47:26.300
 (all laughing)

00:47:26.300 --> 00:47:28.740
 - I think we try, we try a bit of inside baseball.

00:47:28.740 --> 00:47:31.180
 We try to do things that our guests

00:47:31.180 --> 00:47:32.260
 are going to know a lot about.

00:47:32.260 --> 00:47:33.740
 - Yeah, on your Wikipedia page,

00:47:33.740 --> 00:47:35.300
 it says you're an expert in rivets.

00:47:35.300 --> 00:47:36.740
 (all laughing)

00:47:36.740 --> 00:47:38.380
 - Please nobody edit it.

00:47:38.380 --> 00:47:41.740
 There's already a whole bunch of untruths on that page.

00:47:41.740 --> 00:47:44.340
 - But sometimes a little fact about maybe logistics

00:47:44.340 --> 00:47:46.940
 or military strategy will just slip through that.

00:47:46.940 --> 00:47:48.940
 - I wish this was being filmed 'cause you're Facebook.

00:47:48.940 --> 00:47:51.220
 (all laughing)

00:47:51.220 --> 00:47:54.580
 - Yeah, no, the thing with...

00:47:54.580 --> 00:47:59.300
 So taxonomy is the system of naming things in biology.

00:47:59.300 --> 00:48:02.700
 And there's this rule called, it's an a priori thing.

00:48:02.700 --> 00:48:07.700
 And what it means is that if we find a fossil today

00:48:07.700 --> 00:48:10.220
 and we call it something,

00:48:10.220 --> 00:48:13.060
 that is the name it is given if it becomes a species.

00:48:13.060 --> 00:48:15.380
 So if I find a fossil today and I go,

00:48:15.380 --> 00:48:17.100
 oh, it might be homo sapien,

00:48:17.100 --> 00:48:20.100
 or it might be homo shriver.

00:48:20.100 --> 00:48:23.060
 - Okay, we already had a hop of stupidness.

00:48:23.060 --> 00:48:25.260
 (all laughing)

00:48:25.260 --> 00:48:28.220
 - Then let's say there's this, but I publish it.

00:48:28.220 --> 00:48:31.540
 So if I publish it in any journal,

00:48:31.540 --> 00:48:34.580
 then later on, if people are still like,

00:48:34.580 --> 00:48:36.900
 no, no, no, we don't think that's a separate species.

00:48:36.900 --> 00:48:39.260
 If suddenly two more of them are found

00:48:39.260 --> 00:48:41.340
 that really do look similar.

00:48:41.340 --> 00:48:42.460
 And somebody goes, no, actually,

00:48:42.460 --> 00:48:46.420
 we really do think that now needs to be a species.

00:48:46.420 --> 00:48:50.260
 They can't go, well, we want to call it homo, whatever.

00:48:50.260 --> 00:48:52.900
 No, no, the a priori rule is very clear.

00:48:52.900 --> 00:48:54.180
 It has to be called that.

00:48:54.180 --> 00:48:57.660
 So luckily, homo neanderthalensis must have got in there earlier

00:48:57.660 --> 00:49:00.260
 'cause otherwise we would be stuck with that bloody name.

00:49:00.260 --> 00:49:01.340
 - Yeah, it was proposed.

00:49:01.340 --> 00:49:03.060
 It was never seriously taken to a board.

00:49:03.060 --> 00:49:04.780
 It was a guy called Dr. William King,

00:49:04.780 --> 00:49:08.100
 who was an Irish geologist who eventually was the one

00:49:08.100 --> 00:49:09.620
 who said, let's call it neanderthal

00:49:09.620 --> 00:49:12.820
 because it was found, the particular one they were looking at,

00:49:12.820 --> 00:49:15.140
 found in 1856 at the Neander River Valley.

00:49:15.140 --> 00:49:17.260
 So it was named after the area.

00:49:17.260 --> 00:49:19.420
 - And Thal is a valley, isn't it?

00:49:19.420 --> 00:49:20.260
 I don't know that.

00:49:20.260 --> 00:49:21.100
 - Oh, I don't know that.

00:49:21.100 --> 00:49:23.060
 - It was in the Neander Valley.

00:49:23.060 --> 00:49:24.140
 It was in the Neander Valley.

00:49:24.140 --> 00:49:25.540
 - Wow. - Yeah, that's all.

00:49:25.540 --> 00:49:30.060
 - So the homo neanderthalensis is what we call it now.

00:49:30.060 --> 00:49:33.260
 But some people call it homo sapiens neanderthalensis

00:49:33.260 --> 00:49:36.100
 because it might be a subspecies of homo sapien.

00:49:36.100 --> 00:49:39.500
 If it was called homo sapien stupidas,

00:49:39.500 --> 00:49:42.540
 then that would literally be stupid wise man.

00:49:42.540 --> 00:49:43.380
 - Oh yeah.

00:49:43.380 --> 00:49:46.780
 - Because sapiens means wise and that would have been quieter.

00:49:46.780 --> 00:49:49.500
 - Yeah, I don't actually know how sapiens was picked

00:49:49.500 --> 00:49:50.820
 'cause it does feel like we've given ourselves

00:49:50.820 --> 00:49:53.020
 the nice end of the violence, you know.

00:49:53.020 --> 00:49:55.940
 - Yeah, we're great, but I'm just saying it's a bit--

00:49:55.940 --> 00:49:59.380
 - With the naming committee, of course we're gonna.

00:49:59.380 --> 00:50:02.540
 - Some people said once that the brain is the only thing

00:50:02.540 --> 00:50:05.660
 that named itself, which I think is nice.

00:50:05.660 --> 00:50:07.820
 So brain must be a really good word for it.

00:50:07.820 --> 00:50:10.020
 - Yeah, it's actually a rubbish word, isn't it?

00:50:10.020 --> 00:50:11.740
 - Yeah, I think your brain would have come up

00:50:11.740 --> 00:50:12.900
 with something better than that.

00:50:12.900 --> 00:50:14.180
 - Yeah. - Idiot.

00:50:14.180 --> 00:50:15.860
 - One of the names that the neanderthal could have had

00:50:15.860 --> 00:50:18.460
 was Gibraltar man, homo gibraltaris or whatever,

00:50:18.460 --> 00:50:20.740
 because the first, I think the first skulls

00:50:20.740 --> 00:50:23.060
 were found in Gibraltar, but they were found too early.

00:50:23.060 --> 00:50:25.100
 And they were found by I think a soldier

00:50:25.100 --> 00:50:28.060
 and he was a soldier and geologist and he said,

00:50:28.060 --> 00:50:29.580
 I think this might be something new,

00:50:29.580 --> 00:50:32.020
 but he didn't really get anywhere, you know.

00:50:32.020 --> 00:50:32.940
 - Yeah, I think there was a few

00:50:32.940 --> 00:50:34.500
 that were found technically before,

00:50:34.500 --> 00:50:35.620
 but they just didn't identify that.

00:50:35.620 --> 00:50:37.900
 I think there was one in, I think the spi one as well,

00:50:37.900 --> 00:50:40.700
 which is Belgium, I think that's also an early one,

00:50:40.700 --> 00:50:42.300
 where they just didn't--

00:50:42.300 --> 00:50:44.540
 - Oh, Flint, sorry, Flint was his name, Edmund Flint,

00:50:44.540 --> 00:50:46.140
 which is a nice sort of prehistoric sounding name,

00:50:46.140 --> 00:50:46.980
 or you know, like that.

00:50:46.980 --> 00:50:48.340
 - He sounds like he's from Flintstones.

00:50:48.340 --> 00:50:50.300
 - Yeah, he does, and he found it,

00:50:50.300 --> 00:50:51.340
 but again, he didn't get anywhere.

00:50:51.340 --> 00:50:53.220
 And actually, I think the last neanderthals

00:50:53.220 --> 00:50:54.220
 also lived in Gibraltar.

00:50:54.220 --> 00:50:56.980
 - Well, that's, I disagree with that.

00:50:56.980 --> 00:50:58.060
 - Ooh, go on.

00:50:58.060 --> 00:51:00.740
 - No, I think the team out there really believed that,

00:51:00.740 --> 00:51:03.380
 but I don't think most of the rest of us believe that.

00:51:03.380 --> 00:51:04.660
 I think we think it's a tosser.

00:51:04.660 --> 00:51:07.220
 They might have been the Iberian Peninsula, but I just, yeah.

00:51:07.220 --> 00:51:08.500
 - Was it somewhere islandy,

00:51:08.500 --> 00:51:10.100
 where things kind of cling on a bit?

00:51:10.100 --> 00:51:11.420
 - It was probably just the south,

00:51:11.420 --> 00:51:13.260
 but also we just don't know, actually.

00:51:13.260 --> 00:51:15.100
 The dates are consciously shifting.

00:51:15.100 --> 00:51:16.380
 When I say that, I mean that

00:51:16.380 --> 00:51:19.420
 when the scientists are dating them,

00:51:19.420 --> 00:51:21.540
 they're realizing that all the dates we thought we had

00:51:21.540 --> 00:51:24.860
 are kind of not as great, shall we say?

00:51:24.860 --> 00:51:26.660
 There's many question marks about these dates.

00:51:26.660 --> 00:51:29.700
 - I was reading about a neanderthal site in Croatia

00:51:29.700 --> 00:51:31.140
 called Krapina Cave.

00:51:31.140 --> 00:51:31.980
 - Yeah.

00:51:31.980 --> 00:51:35.820
 - And what I found is that they found copper lights in there.

00:51:35.820 --> 00:51:37.980
 So that suggests that the neanderthals

00:51:37.980 --> 00:51:39.780
 might have actually crept in a cave.

00:51:39.780 --> 00:51:40.620
 - Do you know what?

00:51:40.620 --> 00:51:41.460
 - Do you know what?

00:51:41.460 --> 00:51:44.260
 It would take you lot for me to realize that Krapina,

00:51:44.260 --> 00:51:46.500
 which is an integral part of my research,

00:51:46.500 --> 00:51:47.660
 (laughing)

00:51:47.660 --> 00:51:49.220
 is actually crabby.

00:51:49.220 --> 00:51:50.500
 (laughing)

00:51:50.500 --> 00:51:53.700
 I had never in all my years realized that before.

00:51:53.700 --> 00:51:54.540
 - That's so good.

00:51:54.540 --> 00:51:55.380
 - Thank you.

00:51:55.380 --> 00:51:56.220
 - You're very welcome.

00:51:56.220 --> 00:51:57.060
 - Don't really appreciate it.

00:51:57.060 --> 00:51:57.900
 No, I'm not gonna high five you.

00:51:57.900 --> 00:52:00.500
 - Sometimes it takes a fool to teach a wise woman.

00:52:00.500 --> 00:52:01.340
 - That's stupid.

00:52:01.340 --> 00:52:04.220
 (laughing)

00:52:04.220 --> 00:52:06.620
 - Ella, do you know whether or not

00:52:06.620 --> 00:52:08.940
 you're a bit neanderthal?

00:52:08.940 --> 00:52:10.180
 - Yeah, yeah, I got tested.

00:52:10.180 --> 00:52:11.020
 - Yeah.

00:52:11.020 --> 00:52:11.840
 - What's your, what's your number?

00:52:11.840 --> 00:52:12.680
 - I don't know.

00:52:12.680 --> 00:52:13.520
 I can't remember.

00:52:13.520 --> 00:52:14.360
 - You can't remember?

00:52:14.360 --> 00:52:15.200
 - I can't remember.

00:52:15.200 --> 00:52:16.020
 - You study neanderthals and you can even be--

00:52:16.020 --> 00:52:16.860
 - I can't remember.

00:52:16.860 --> 00:52:17.700
 Retaining it.

00:52:17.700 --> 00:52:20.180
 It was average-ish as far as I can remember.

00:52:20.180 --> 00:52:21.020
 - Is that what I want?

00:52:21.020 --> 00:52:21.860
 - 2% is average, yeah.

00:52:21.860 --> 00:52:22.900
 - 2%, and you can do that.

00:52:22.900 --> 00:52:24.580
 So the National Geographic Society,

00:52:24.580 --> 00:52:26.540
 they have a geographic project

00:52:26.540 --> 00:52:28.740
 where you do a swab in your mouth and you send it in

00:52:28.740 --> 00:52:29.980
 and then they can give you the results

00:52:29.980 --> 00:52:30.820
 and tell you whether you're not.

00:52:30.820 --> 00:52:32.460
 And then I think we've, you know,

00:52:32.460 --> 00:52:35.380
 we know Ozzy Osbourne is a bit neanderthal.

00:52:35.380 --> 00:52:37.020
 - I mean, we mostly are.

00:52:37.020 --> 00:52:39.860
 - Is it, everyone outside Africa is a couple of percent

00:52:39.860 --> 00:52:43.820
 and that because early humans left Africa,

00:52:43.820 --> 00:52:45.100
 bred with neanderthals,

00:52:45.100 --> 00:52:48.900
 those populations spread to like Europe, Asia.

00:52:48.900 --> 00:52:51.340
 But then, so is it called ghost DNA?

00:52:51.340 --> 00:52:52.180
 I love this.

00:52:52.180 --> 00:52:53.020
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:52:53.020 --> 00:52:55.740
 - Even people in Africa these days have kind of

00:52:55.740 --> 00:52:57.740
 a small fraction of a percent of neanderthal DNA.

00:52:57.740 --> 00:52:59.740
 - Well, so there's a few things going on there.

00:52:59.740 --> 00:53:01.620
 One is that, yes, it's,

00:53:01.620 --> 00:53:03.700
 so everybody outside of sub-Saharan Africa.

00:53:03.700 --> 00:53:05.260
 So like the Tennesseans have got some,

00:53:05.260 --> 00:53:06.700
 you know, the Egyptians have got some.

00:53:06.700 --> 00:53:08.860
 And what it is is neanderthals were more European,

00:53:08.860 --> 00:53:10.780
 Asian species and never went into Africa.

00:53:10.780 --> 00:53:13.660
 So it was, that's why sub-Saharan don't really have it.

00:53:13.660 --> 00:53:16.540
 The ghost DNA, so this is really cool.

00:53:16.540 --> 00:53:20.100
 So now ancient DNA is so fascinating

00:53:20.100 --> 00:53:21.700
 that they have been able to identify

00:53:21.700 --> 00:53:23.180
 that there are other species out there

00:53:23.180 --> 00:53:25.620
 called Homo God knows what,

00:53:25.620 --> 00:53:28.860
 but they just don't have a single fossil for it.

00:53:28.860 --> 00:53:30.740
 They don't know anything about this,

00:53:30.740 --> 00:53:34.700
 but they know based on looking at all of our DNA globally,

00:53:34.700 --> 00:53:37.100
 there were other species that we interbred with.

00:53:37.100 --> 00:53:38.220
 And we just don't know.

00:53:38.220 --> 00:53:39.860
 So we know that we interbred with neanderthals.

00:53:39.860 --> 00:53:42.900
 We know that we interbred with a species called Denisiva.

00:53:42.900 --> 00:53:45.180
 And then yeah, in the process of doing all this,

00:53:45.180 --> 00:53:47.500
 they've also come across a few ghost lineages.

00:53:47.500 --> 00:53:49.420
 And they're like, how do you marry it up

00:53:49.420 --> 00:53:50.580
 with the fossils that are out there?

00:53:50.580 --> 00:53:52.300
 'Cause you're like, I don't know what it looks like.

00:53:52.300 --> 00:53:55.340
 - So can we, do we not name it until we find a fossil?

00:53:55.340 --> 00:53:57.540
 - So in genetics, if it's a ghost lineage,

00:53:57.540 --> 00:53:59.820
 they tend to like give it like population Y

00:53:59.820 --> 00:54:01.860
 or population X or that kind of thing.

00:54:01.860 --> 00:54:03.980
 They don't give it a name because they really don't know.

00:54:03.980 --> 00:54:07.300
 - You've got to give it a cooler name than that, you know?

00:54:07.300 --> 00:54:08.420
 - With that, yeah, that's the whole point.

00:54:08.420 --> 00:54:10.180
 It's a standby name, isn't it?

00:54:10.180 --> 00:54:11.020
 - Oh yeah, I see.

00:54:11.020 --> 00:54:13.140
 And then they'll come up with a really cool name first.

00:54:13.140 --> 00:54:14.540
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah, you're right.

00:54:14.540 --> 00:54:16.740
 - But like imagine if like, so you've got Homo naledi,

00:54:16.740 --> 00:54:20.220
 which is a new species that they discovered in South Africa.

00:54:20.220 --> 00:54:23.220
 And that might be the ghost lineage,

00:54:23.220 --> 00:54:24.420
 but that might be one of them.

00:54:24.420 --> 00:54:25.740
 But we just, we don't know.

00:54:25.740 --> 00:54:27.980
 'Cause until we've got DNA, we can't compare the two.

00:54:27.980 --> 00:54:29.620
 - A DNA from a fossil.

00:54:29.620 --> 00:54:30.700
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:54:30.700 --> 00:54:32.620
 You need the DNA.

00:54:32.620 --> 00:54:34.940
 You need DNA from the fossils you've got

00:54:34.940 --> 00:54:36.660
 to be able to compare it to this ghost lineage.

00:54:36.660 --> 00:54:38.820
 - So it might be from Homo naledi.

00:54:38.820 --> 00:54:39.660
 - It might be naledi, it might be naledi.

00:54:39.660 --> 00:54:41.340
 We just don't know.

00:54:41.340 --> 00:54:42.180
 It's so cool.

00:54:42.180 --> 00:54:43.020
 - It's cool.

00:54:43.020 --> 00:54:44.340
 - So the guy that found naledi, Lee Berger,

00:54:44.340 --> 00:54:45.660
 is like, I reckon it is.

00:54:45.660 --> 00:54:47.380
 But we were like, maybe.

00:54:47.380 --> 00:54:48.660
 We don't know though.

00:54:48.660 --> 00:54:49.500
 - Yeah.

00:54:49.500 --> 00:54:50.340
 - Sorry, I got very excited.

00:54:50.340 --> 00:54:51.180
 - No, it is exciting.

00:54:51.180 --> 00:54:52.020
 It's incredible.

00:54:52.020 --> 00:54:54.620
 - Do you know, is his name Svante Pabo?

00:54:54.620 --> 00:54:55.660
 - Svante Pabo, yeah.

00:54:55.660 --> 00:54:57.420
 - So he's a Swedish DNA expert.

00:54:57.420 --> 00:54:59.900
 And I think, did he start the field of extracting DNA

00:54:59.900 --> 00:55:00.740
 from ancient bones?

00:55:00.740 --> 00:55:01.860
 - He got a Nobel Prize for it.

00:55:01.860 --> 00:55:02.820
 - Oh, nice.

00:55:02.820 --> 00:55:05.380
 Well, congratulations, Professor Pabo.

00:55:05.380 --> 00:55:07.620
 - And it was really funny because he won it for medicine.

00:55:07.620 --> 00:55:10.940
 And everybody went, we just had COVID.

00:55:10.940 --> 00:55:11.860
 What?

00:55:11.860 --> 00:55:12.900
 We just had COVID.

00:55:12.900 --> 00:55:13.860
 And you've given it to this guy.

00:55:13.860 --> 00:55:16.580
 He's found a DNA for slow clap.

00:55:16.580 --> 00:55:19.420
 - He published this study.

00:55:19.420 --> 00:55:22.140
 And you know, he'd realized that you could extract DNA

00:55:22.140 --> 00:55:22.980
 from old bones.

00:55:22.980 --> 00:55:23.820
 And that's a huge realization.

00:55:23.820 --> 00:55:25.060
 He worked out how to do it as well.

00:55:25.060 --> 00:55:28.580
 And he got letters, lots of letters from men saying,

00:55:28.580 --> 00:55:31.100
 "I'm Neanderthal actually."

00:55:31.100 --> 00:55:33.900
 And he said, "Fully or partly, Neanderthal."

00:55:33.900 --> 00:55:37.220
 And offering him samples to analyze for his work.

00:55:37.220 --> 00:55:38.540
 - What kind of samples?

00:55:38.540 --> 00:55:39.500
 - I think spit samples.

00:55:39.500 --> 00:55:42.500
 I think, but there's a really interesting,

00:55:42.500 --> 00:55:44.820
 there's definitely a gender divide here

00:55:44.820 --> 00:55:48.020
 because 12 women wrote into him to say,

00:55:48.020 --> 00:55:50.860
 "My husband is definitely, he's a Neanderthal."

00:55:50.860 --> 00:55:52.300
 You can study him if you like.

00:55:52.300 --> 00:55:55.860
 Only two men wrote saying the same of their wives.

00:55:55.860 --> 00:55:57.580
 And I don't know if any women wrote in saying,

00:55:57.580 --> 00:56:00.140
 "I think I'm pretty sure I'm a Neanderthal."

00:56:00.140 --> 00:56:00.980
 So there's an interesting thing

00:56:00.980 --> 00:56:02.660
 about how we think of Neanderthals today.

00:56:02.660 --> 00:56:04.380
 That's what it tells us about, really.

00:56:04.380 --> 00:56:05.220
 - Fair enough.

00:56:05.220 --> 00:56:06.980
 - That's actually so true because,

00:56:06.980 --> 00:56:09.500
 sorry, I pointed at you very aggressively then, but.

00:56:09.500 --> 00:56:10.940
 - Andy just for the listeners.

00:56:10.940 --> 00:56:11.900
 - Yes.

00:56:11.900 --> 00:56:15.900
 So I made a show called Neanderthals for the BBC and PBS.

00:56:15.900 --> 00:56:17.380
 And.

00:56:17.380 --> 00:56:19.500
 - Oh, with Andy Serkis.

00:56:19.500 --> 00:56:21.820
 - Andy Serkis who is Gollum in Lord of the Rings.

00:56:21.820 --> 00:56:22.940
 - Yeah, and a million other things.

00:56:22.940 --> 00:56:25.340
 Like the guy's got a very impressive resume.

00:56:25.340 --> 00:56:27.260
 And there was this really big discussion

00:56:27.260 --> 00:56:29.300
 because we were like, "Blatingly, you're gonna make,

00:56:29.300 --> 00:56:31.260
 "the reconstruction is gonna be a male."

00:56:31.260 --> 00:56:34.500
 But actually, why are the reconstructions of cave men

00:56:34.500 --> 00:56:36.020
 always men?

00:56:36.020 --> 00:56:36.860
 Like, it doesn't make,

00:56:36.860 --> 00:56:38.380
 like think about the descent of man image

00:56:38.380 --> 00:56:40.420
 where it's like, you know, from ape to human.

00:56:40.420 --> 00:56:41.660
 It's always just men.

00:56:41.660 --> 00:56:42.940
 And it's like, well, they definitely

00:56:42.940 --> 00:56:44.260
 didn't do that on their own, right?

00:56:44.260 --> 00:56:46.420
 So it's like, where are the women in this?

00:56:46.420 --> 00:56:47.940
 And we had a really big discussion.

00:56:47.940 --> 00:56:51.500
 And in the end, we did make a man and we called it Ned.

00:56:51.500 --> 00:56:52.620
 But we did make a Nelly.

00:56:52.620 --> 00:56:55.460
 But the Nelly was not of the same quality.

00:56:55.460 --> 00:56:58.420
 The animation wasn't, it wasn't Andy Serkis' work.

00:56:58.420 --> 00:56:59.260
 Let's just put it like that.

00:56:59.260 --> 00:57:02.060
 - Was Andy Serkis playing the motion capture Neanderthal?

00:57:02.060 --> 00:57:03.780
 - He brought the Neanderthal to life, basically.

00:57:03.780 --> 00:57:06.620
 - Did he co-host as that?

00:57:06.620 --> 00:57:08.980
 - No, no, no, he was, there's this scene where he,

00:57:08.980 --> 00:57:09.940
 actually, I love this scene.

00:57:09.940 --> 00:57:11.380
 It kind of gives me goosebumps when I see it,

00:57:11.380 --> 00:57:13.620
 where he wakes the Neanderthal up from his slumber.

00:57:13.620 --> 00:57:16.020
 So it's an Iraqi Neanderthal and he wakes it up from its slumber.

00:57:16.020 --> 00:57:16.860
 So he's used it.

00:57:16.860 --> 00:57:19.340
 He's like Andy's freaking Serkis.

00:57:19.340 --> 00:57:21.300
 - Was he both of the male and the female?

00:57:21.300 --> 00:57:22.140
 - No, no, no.

00:57:22.140 --> 00:57:24.580
 They literally, then he was forgotten about.

00:57:24.580 --> 00:57:25.660
 Not in your Nelly.

00:57:25.660 --> 00:57:27.420
 - No, no, no, no, no.

00:57:27.420 --> 00:57:28.260
 - But he was.

00:57:28.260 --> 00:57:30.260
 - I do wish he co-hosted it as the end of the film.

00:57:30.260 --> 00:57:31.100
 - Yeah, that would have been.

00:57:31.100 --> 00:57:31.940
 - What could she have been?

00:57:31.940 --> 00:57:32.780
 - Al-Shamahi.

00:57:32.780 --> 00:57:35.020
 (laughing)

00:57:35.020 --> 00:57:38.100
 - So do you guys know why Neanderthals

00:57:38.100 --> 00:57:40.220
 have got such a bad rep?

00:57:40.220 --> 00:57:42.100
 - Oh, oh, was it, oh.

00:57:42.100 --> 00:57:44.820
 - Did they find what were effectively, unfortunately,

00:57:44.820 --> 00:57:47.100
 deformed skeletons and so on?

00:57:47.100 --> 00:57:48.660
 And yeah, and so we just thought,

00:57:48.660 --> 00:57:51.020
 ah, that must be what they all looked like.

00:57:51.020 --> 00:57:55.180
 - Yeah, so basically it was an individual,

00:57:55.180 --> 00:57:58.900
 L'Achabalocin, don't query my French.

00:57:58.900 --> 00:58:02.900
 And it was a highly arthritic individual.

00:58:02.900 --> 00:58:04.780
 It was an old man, although I'm pretty sure

00:58:04.780 --> 00:58:07.900
 it was only like 40, but, you know, old for the time,

00:58:07.900 --> 00:58:09.980
 but very young for today.

00:58:09.980 --> 00:58:12.220
 (laughing)

00:58:12.220 --> 00:58:13.900
 And they basically, he was--

00:58:13.900 --> 00:58:14.940
 - I don't like the way you looked at me

00:58:14.940 --> 00:58:16.260
 when you said that, I like that.

00:58:16.260 --> 00:58:17.460
 (laughing)

00:58:17.460 --> 00:58:19.020
 - He was highly arthritic.

00:58:19.020 --> 00:58:21.460
 And there's a number of things going on here,

00:58:21.460 --> 00:58:26.460
 but the guy who did the reconstruction of this fossil

00:58:26.460 --> 00:58:30.060
 basically portrayed it as being like,

00:58:30.060 --> 00:58:31.220
 essentially knuckle-dragging,

00:58:31.220 --> 00:58:34.020
 well, kind of its heads jutting forward.

00:58:34.020 --> 00:58:37.340
 It's, you know, its knees are bent, blah, blah, blah.

00:58:37.340 --> 00:58:40.100
 And then they obviously realized later on

00:58:40.100 --> 00:58:41.660
 that that was completely incorrect,

00:58:41.660 --> 00:58:42.500
 but it was too late.

00:58:42.500 --> 00:58:44.580
 It was like it got out there that this is,

00:58:44.580 --> 00:58:46.380
 and because we were looking for a missing link

00:58:46.380 --> 00:58:47.620
 in inverted commas, right?

00:58:47.620 --> 00:58:49.140
 So it kind of fit the narrative.

00:58:49.140 --> 00:58:50.780
 And it was a new field, right?

00:58:50.780 --> 00:58:53.940
 Reconstructing what somebody looked like from a fossil

00:58:53.940 --> 00:58:55.540
 was such a new field that, you know,

00:58:55.540 --> 00:58:57.940
 and so essentially, it's everybody's speculating since

00:58:57.940 --> 00:58:59.380
 as to why he did such a bad job,

00:58:59.380 --> 00:59:01.940
 which is really embarrassing because he's a legacy

00:59:01.940 --> 00:59:04.980
 amongst other things, 'cause he's quite a renowned person,

00:59:04.980 --> 00:59:07.740
 is that he basically did an awful PR job on the underfills.

00:59:07.740 --> 00:59:11.100
 - Oh, this is amazing, like if just like, for instance,

00:59:11.100 --> 00:59:13.260
 in a million years time, they find humans

00:59:13.260 --> 00:59:16.300
 and they only find my body,

00:59:16.300 --> 00:59:18.300
 I have very bad sinuses, right?

00:59:18.300 --> 00:59:21.300
 They're just gonna think all humans had a cold all the time.

00:59:21.300 --> 00:59:22.140
 - That's it.

00:59:22.140 --> 00:59:22.980
 - Yeah, that's it.

00:59:22.980 --> 00:59:24.340
 - You know, and that's basically what happened.

00:59:24.340 --> 00:59:25.180
 - That's completely--

00:59:25.180 --> 00:59:26.740
 - They're gonna find Dan's body and think

00:59:26.740 --> 00:59:28.500
 all humans were unbelievably hairy.

00:59:28.500 --> 00:59:30.300
 - So they'll think, oh, wait, they--

00:59:30.300 --> 00:59:31.860
 - I love how you guys don't know how bodies

00:59:31.860 --> 00:59:33.660
 and decomposition work, so we're sure, yeah,

00:59:33.660 --> 00:59:35.860
 hair is gonna be found on--

00:59:35.860 --> 00:59:36.900
 - They'll find Andy and they'll be like,

00:59:36.900 --> 00:59:40.900
 well, all humans used to make model hair replacements.

00:59:40.900 --> 00:59:42.460
 - That's 'cause they'll have found me in my tomb

00:59:42.460 --> 00:59:44.980
 where I've been buried with all my air fixes.

00:59:44.980 --> 00:59:47.420
 - And all your rivet pivots, rivets, rivets.

00:59:47.420 --> 00:59:48.380
 - Oh, my riveting.

00:59:48.380 --> 00:59:49.900
 (all laughing)

00:59:49.900 --> 00:59:52.480
 (upbeat music)

00:59:52.480 --> 00:59:56.860
