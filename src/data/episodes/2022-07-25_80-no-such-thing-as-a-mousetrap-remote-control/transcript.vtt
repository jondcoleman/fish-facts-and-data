 [SPEAKING SPANISH]

00:00:05.980 --> 00:00:14.000
 Hello, and welcome to another episode of No Such Thing

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.360
 as a Fish, a weekly podcast this week

00:00:16.360 --> 00:00:18.860
 coming to you from the Edinburgh Fringe Festival.

00:00:18.860 --> 00:00:20.920
 My name is Dan Schreiber, and joining me

00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:22.440
 as ever is the three QILs.

00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:25.860
 Please welcome to the stage Andy, Barry,

00:00:25.860 --> 00:00:29.820
 James Harkin, and Anish Zinski.

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:30.820
 Oh!

00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:37.400
 And once again, we have gathered around the microphones

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:39.900
 with our four favorite facts from the last seven days,

00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:41.440
 and no particular order.

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:43.500
 Here we go, starting with you.

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:44.200
 Andy Murray.

00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:47.780
 Andy, my name is Andy.

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:49.820
 My fact this week is that the first ever pencils

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:53.300
 we used to draw on sheep.

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:55.420
 The fact-- and I found this out last month

00:00:55.420 --> 00:00:59.860
 at the Cumberland Pencil Museum, which is an amazing museum.

00:00:59.860 --> 00:01:02.040
 If you're ever in the area, you have to go.

00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:04.420
 It's in Kessik, and it features, among many other things,

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:08.140
 a giant collage of Chris Evans made of pencils,

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:10.940
 which is the most nightmare-ish thing you could--

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:13.020
 it's so amazing.

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:14.820
 Yeah, so first pencils we used for sheep.

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:15.140
 Why?

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:16.340
 So why?

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:18.300
 Well, I mean, the story is, and it's not

00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:20.300
 sure how much this is sort of half-myth,

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:22.660
 but the story is that some shepherds found a load of graphite,

00:01:22.660 --> 00:01:24.860
 which had been turfed up in a storm.

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:27.000
 The tree had been blown out, and there was this sort of black

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:28.460
 shiny stuff in the roots.

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:30.700
 And they realized that it made marks and stuff,

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:33.180
 and that's how they started using it to draw on their sheep.

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:35.900
 And the first ever pencils were just lumps of graphite wrapped

00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:36.820
 in sheep skin.

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:37.620
 OK, that's good.

00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:39.140
 I did slightly have an impression

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:40.340
 that they were sort of riding, you know,

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:44.160
 novels, and then they just hand your sheep into a publisher.

00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:46.260
 Yeah, there you go.

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:49.260
 So when did someone decide that we can now take it off sheep

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:50.860
 and put it into other uses?

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:53.500
 Well, that initial discovery was in the 16th century.

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:55.500
 And there are some people who say that it went back earlier.

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:57.220
 People say that the Aztecs might have found it

00:01:57.220 --> 00:01:59.140
 and used it as a market a few hundred years before,

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:00.980
 but there isn't too much evidence about that.

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:03.220
 Yeah, but it was a massive market, wasn't it, the graphite?

00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:04.660
 Like, if you stole graphite, you would

00:02:04.660 --> 00:02:06.700
 be sent to Australia as punishment.

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:08.740
 Yeah, and they used to have, like, armed guards,

00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:11.200
 shaperoning their horses and carts with a graphite down

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:12.700
 to London, didn't they, from Cambodia?

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:14.500
 Yeah, and even the miners, as you were mining it,

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:17.380
 you would have two men with blunderbosses next to you

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:19.780
 to make sure you weren't slipping it into your pockets.

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:21.820
 It is kind of extraordinary.

00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:23.980
 And so there was this naturally occurring graphite

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:26.780
 that was found in Borodale in the Lake District.

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:30.020
 And that's the only big source of solid graphite

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:31.220
 that's ever been found.

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:34.180
 So we, I mean, Britain controlled the pencil industry

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:35.380
 for some time.

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:36.460
 Yeah, we were nailing that.

00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:38.740
 It was huge, that was a massive deal.

00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:41.820
 And, right, now, the Cumberland Pantsam Museum says this,

00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:43.300
 and I can't quite believe it.

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:46.980
 They say that in 1650, graphite was briefly more valuable

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:47.940
 than gold.

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:49.660
 But what they did was they deliberately

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:52.540
 only mined it for short amounts of time in the year

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:54.540
 to kind of keep the price up.

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:56.020
 Because we have this monopoly on it,

00:02:56.020 --> 00:02:57.820
 and we've sent it all the way around the world,

00:02:57.820 --> 00:02:59.780
 and they just wanted to keep the price as high as possible.

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:01.460
 Oh, clever.

00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:03.860
 But now, hasn't it now turned once again

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:05.940
 into one of the most expensive materials in the world?

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:08.020
 Yeah, the pencils are more expensive than gold.

00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:09.860
 Yeah, yeah.

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:10.380
 No, no.

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:11.220
 But so--

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:14.660
 And a few here, I'll sell to you after the show.

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:17.900
 We met-- James and I have actually met a guy whose--

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:20.780
 his name's Andre Geim, and he discovered--

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:23.100
 so he's a scientist, but he does all sorts of interesting

00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:23.700
 science things.

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:25.980
 For example, they had the biggest-- what was it?

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:27.860
 The biggest magnet in the world.

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:29.620
 Yeah, he made a frog levitate.

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:33.300
 So basically, he was passing the biggest magnet in the world,

00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:34.740
 and he thought, oh, that's a pretty big magnet.

00:03:34.740 --> 00:03:36.980
 I wonder what would happen if you something went into it.

00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:39.380
 So he threw his ham sandwich into it, and it floated.

00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:41.020
 It just floated inside this magnet.

00:03:41.020 --> 00:03:43.860
 And then he won an award for floating a frog inside it.

00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:46.660
 Do you think sheep and frogs have a mutual support group

00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:50.420
 where they discuss what people have subjected them to?

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:53.020
 And they drew all over me for 300 years.

00:03:53.020 --> 00:03:55.820
 Well, I was levitated between magnets.

00:03:55.820 --> 00:03:57.740
 Will you say you chucked a ham sandwich in there?

00:03:57.740 --> 00:03:58.260
 Yeah.

00:03:58.260 --> 00:03:59.580
 That's an amazingly cavalier use of what

00:03:59.580 --> 00:04:01.700
 is presumably a really expensive bit of equipment.

00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:02.300
 I know.

00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:05.900
 It was a bowl of ham sandwich.

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:07.820
 Yeah, he won a Nick Nobel Prize for that,

00:04:07.820 --> 00:04:11.660
 but then he won a Nobel Prize for discovering graphene,

00:04:11.660 --> 00:04:12.460
 which is done.

00:04:12.460 --> 00:04:13.660
 Which is pencils.

00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:16.700
 You know that when you write with them, that bit that comes out?

00:04:16.700 --> 00:04:19.700
 Back to you, James.

00:04:19.700 --> 00:04:23.020
 Yeah, it's a layer of carbon, which is basically one atom thick.

00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:24.380
 They think it's going to be the future, and they'll

00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:25.420
 make all sorts of things out.

00:04:25.420 --> 00:04:28.180
 And it turns out that it's the strongest material

00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:30.060
 that we found in the universe.

00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:33.620
 Graphene is so strong that if you had a sheet of it,

00:04:33.620 --> 00:04:35.180
 I think I read this.

00:04:35.180 --> 00:04:37.580
 You could balance an elephant, right?

00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:39.420
 And a grown elephant on--

00:04:39.420 --> 00:04:41.220
 the elephant is standing on a pencil,

00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:44.100
 and the pencil is pointing down on a sheet of graphene,

00:04:44.100 --> 00:04:45.620
 and the graphene won't break.

00:04:45.620 --> 00:04:47.020
 That's how strong it is.

00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:49.220
 How are you lifting the elephant onto the pencil, though?

00:04:49.220 --> 00:04:52.300
 I think that's the question.

00:04:52.300 --> 00:04:55.100
 So you were saying about how long was it until we had pencils?

00:04:55.100 --> 00:04:57.540
 Well, actually, graphite is kind of OK,

00:04:57.540 --> 00:04:59.660
 but it wasn't quite good for pencils,

00:04:59.660 --> 00:05:01.740
 because it kind of fell apart a little bit.

00:05:01.740 --> 00:05:05.460
 And in 1843, an artist called William Brockenden

00:05:05.460 --> 00:05:08.300
 invented a machine, which could press graphite

00:05:08.300 --> 00:05:10.260
 so that you could have actual lead,

00:05:10.260 --> 00:05:11.820
 like you would have in pencils.

00:05:11.820 --> 00:05:14.780
 But that machine actually has had a much better use.

00:05:14.780 --> 00:05:17.060
 They found out you could use it to make pills,

00:05:17.060 --> 00:05:19.380
 and all the pills that you eat today--

00:05:19.380 --> 00:05:22.180
 All the pills, all the many pills I have--

00:05:22.180 --> 00:05:23.860
 I have some in my pocket, which I'm going to sell to Dan,

00:05:23.860 --> 00:05:25.900
 I'll bet the show.

00:05:25.900 --> 00:05:27.900
 Yeah, all the pills that you take today

00:05:27.900 --> 00:05:30.500
 have come because of the invention of pencils.

00:05:30.500 --> 00:05:31.100
 Wow.

00:05:31.100 --> 00:05:31.940
 It's interesting, isn't it?

00:05:31.940 --> 00:05:32.940
 Really?

00:05:32.940 --> 00:05:35.940
 Oh, and tabloids used to be pills, didn't they?

00:05:35.940 --> 00:05:36.740
 Oh, yeah.

00:05:36.740 --> 00:05:38.060
 That was the origin of the tabloid.

00:05:38.060 --> 00:05:42.140
 Pills used to be much harder to swallow back in the days.

00:05:42.140 --> 00:05:44.700
 That's-- I wanted to use this as a main fact for the show,

00:05:44.700 --> 00:05:46.980
 but bubble wrap was not used as bubble wrap.

00:05:46.980 --> 00:05:48.900
 It was originally designed as wallpaper.

00:05:48.900 --> 00:05:50.700
 And then for years, we're trying to get people

00:05:50.700 --> 00:05:53.140
 to buy their futuristic wallpaper.

00:05:53.140 --> 00:05:55.260
 And no one liked it, and it sat in an office for ages.

00:05:55.260 --> 00:05:57.100
 And then suddenly, someone just went--

00:05:57.100 --> 00:05:58.700
 when we put it in this box, and it worked,

00:05:58.700 --> 00:06:00.020
 and suddenly, that's how the industry grew.

00:06:00.020 --> 00:06:01.180
 But they sat there for years, just going,

00:06:01.180 --> 00:06:02.180
 what are we going to do with our--

00:06:02.180 --> 00:06:04.500
 They sat there for years, just popping the wallpaper.

00:06:04.500 --> 00:06:06.780
 This is amazing.

00:06:06.780 --> 00:06:08.300
 No one getting any work done.

00:06:08.300 --> 00:06:09.300
 Yeah.

00:06:09.300 --> 00:06:12.420
 The 2013, they had a thing called the Diagram Prize.

00:06:12.420 --> 00:06:15.900
 They have it every year, and it's for the weirdest book title.

00:06:15.900 --> 00:06:19.020
 And in that year, the prize was won by a book called

00:06:19.020 --> 00:06:22.580
 Goblin Proofing, One's Chicken Coop.

00:06:22.580 --> 00:06:25.060
 But what came second, or what beat to the prize,

00:06:25.060 --> 00:06:28.460
 was a book called How to Sharpen Pencils.

00:06:28.460 --> 00:06:29.780
 It's by David Reese.

00:06:29.780 --> 00:06:31.980
 And I went on to Amazon to see if I could buy it.

00:06:31.980 --> 00:06:34.700
 And they have a deal where people who buy the sharpening

00:06:34.700 --> 00:06:37.660
 pencils book also buy pencil sharpeners

00:06:37.660 --> 00:06:39.900
 and a set of 12 pencils.

00:06:39.900 --> 00:06:42.620
 And you can get them all for 45 pounds, 87.

00:06:42.620 --> 00:06:44.420
 That's not bad.

00:06:44.420 --> 00:06:47.940
 It is actually just the shorter version of the title of that book.

00:06:47.940 --> 00:06:50.860
 So the longer version is a practical and theoretical treatise

00:06:50.860 --> 00:06:52.700
 on the artisanal craft of pencil sharpening

00:06:52.700 --> 00:06:54.940
 for writers, artists, contractors, and flange turners.

00:06:54.940 --> 00:07:00.220
 It has unbelievably high ratings.

00:07:00.220 --> 00:07:02.780
 So it has 82 ratings on Amazon.

00:07:02.780 --> 00:07:05.500
 And more than three-quarters of them are five-star ratings.

00:07:05.500 --> 00:07:07.260
 So one rating, the top five-star rating,

00:07:07.260 --> 00:07:13.060
 is headed sharp and to the point, which was nice.

00:07:13.060 --> 00:07:14.980
 He also runs the guy who wrote it, David Reese.

00:07:14.980 --> 00:07:18.140
 Now runs a pencil sharpener sharpening business,

00:07:18.140 --> 00:07:20.780
 where you can send your pencil to him.

00:07:20.780 --> 00:07:21.820
 Why?

00:07:21.820 --> 00:07:22.820
 And he'll send it back.

00:07:22.820 --> 00:07:23.820
 And he will sharpen it.

00:07:23.820 --> 00:07:24.860
 Wrapped in bubble wrap.

00:07:24.860 --> 00:07:27.340
 He says, there's a quote from him.

00:07:27.340 --> 00:07:30.700
 He says, I'm sure there's probably somebody in India

00:07:30.700 --> 00:07:32.300
 who could sharpen your pencil for less.

00:07:32.300 --> 00:07:34.620
 But if you want authentic American craftsmanship.

00:07:34.620 --> 00:07:37.340
 Wow.

00:07:37.340 --> 00:07:39.740
 Is it true, the thing about the musing pencils in space?

00:07:39.740 --> 00:07:42.420
 It's true that they did, but the thing that isn't true

00:07:42.420 --> 00:07:46.540
 is that America spent billions making a special ball pod pen.

00:07:46.540 --> 00:07:47.940
 And the Russians just took a pencil.

00:07:47.940 --> 00:07:49.380
 Actually, they all just took pencils.

00:07:49.380 --> 00:07:50.300
 OK, yeah.

00:07:50.300 --> 00:07:52.300
 And then the space pen was developed,

00:07:52.300 --> 00:07:55.940
 which was that great pen that you can buy commercially now.

00:07:55.940 --> 00:07:58.380
 And a really interesting thing, it was down to that pen

00:07:58.380 --> 00:07:59.860
 that both Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin

00:07:59.860 --> 00:08:03.620
 were able to get off the moon because, yeah, no one knows

00:08:03.620 --> 00:08:05.500
 how important this actually was.

00:08:05.500 --> 00:08:07.900
 So as they were on the moon, and it was time for take off,

00:08:07.900 --> 00:08:09.980
 they had the ignition switch, which had to go on

00:08:09.980 --> 00:08:12.380
 to set the boosters off to launch back in space.

00:08:12.380 --> 00:08:15.180
 And as Buzz Aldrin's flicked it on, it broken half.

00:08:15.180 --> 00:08:18.300
 And he thought, oh, that's--

00:08:18.300 --> 00:08:21.500
 I think he didn't say, oh, oh.

00:08:21.500 --> 00:08:22.740
 What's he daisy?

00:08:22.740 --> 00:08:25.500
 Oh, spaghetti, oh.

00:08:25.500 --> 00:08:27.980
 So what he did was he took out his pen,

00:08:27.980 --> 00:08:31.140
 and he put it into the switch, and he used that as the switch

00:08:31.140 --> 00:08:32.620
 to get them off the moon, yeah.

00:08:32.620 --> 00:08:33.660
 Wow, that's amazing.

00:08:33.660 --> 00:08:35.100
 I did not know that.

00:08:35.100 --> 00:08:36.180
 Wow.

00:08:36.180 --> 00:08:42.580
 The world's largest pencil has a 250 pound eraser on the end.

00:08:42.580 --> 00:08:45.180
 The lead is 4,000 pounds in weight.

00:08:45.180 --> 00:08:47.700
 And the exterior is a perfect yellow hue

00:08:47.700 --> 00:08:49.700
 of these typical American yellow pencils.

00:08:49.700 --> 00:08:51.420
 It's from Pennsylvania.

00:08:51.420 --> 00:08:53.540
 No, no way.

00:08:53.540 --> 00:08:57.060
 Sorry, is it really?

00:08:57.060 --> 00:08:59.020
 The graph out is from Pennsylvania.

00:08:59.020 --> 00:09:00.180
 Yeah, is it really?

00:09:00.180 --> 00:09:01.940
 I never noticed that.

00:09:01.940 --> 00:09:03.940
 Oh, my god.

00:09:03.940 --> 00:09:05.980
 This is not spelled pencil, but here is it.

00:09:05.980 --> 00:09:06.980
 Yeah.

00:09:06.980 --> 00:09:08.780
 Wait, did you just notice when he said it out loud just then?

00:09:08.780 --> 00:09:10.460
 I noticed it when everyone laughed.

00:09:10.460 --> 00:09:13.460
 Oh.

00:09:13.460 --> 00:09:15.980
 It'd be a really cool sort of cartoon character

00:09:15.980 --> 00:09:19.500
 of a vampire with pencils for teach from Pennsylvania.

00:09:19.500 --> 00:09:21.260
 That'd be great.

00:09:21.260 --> 00:09:22.260
 Amazing.

00:09:22.260 --> 00:09:25.420
 They-- the one problem with this massive pencil

00:09:25.420 --> 00:09:26.740
 that they didn't think of--

00:09:26.740 --> 00:09:28.700
 Well, then it can't be lifted by any human.

00:09:28.700 --> 00:09:31.700
 Is that the one problem?

00:09:31.700 --> 00:09:33.100
 There was one more problem.

00:09:33.100 --> 00:09:36.300
 They said, we thought about making the world's largest pencil

00:09:36.300 --> 00:09:38.020
 sharpener, but we ran out of money.

00:09:38.020 --> 00:09:44.020
 Do you know the speaking of having rubbers on them,

00:09:44.020 --> 00:09:47.700
 the guy who discovered that rubber could erase pencils?

00:09:47.700 --> 00:09:50.420
 So before that, people used to use wet bread, didn't they?

00:09:50.420 --> 00:09:51.580
 Yes, breadcrumbs.

00:09:51.580 --> 00:09:53.660
 But the guy who discovered that rubber-- first row,

00:09:53.660 --> 00:09:55.700
 that rubber could be used to erase pencil--

00:09:55.700 --> 00:09:58.460
 also discovered oxygen is priestly.

00:09:58.460 --> 00:09:59.300
 Yeah, yeah.

00:09:59.300 --> 00:10:00.900
 And he was the first person to write, oh, by the way,

00:10:00.900 --> 00:10:02.380
 this rubber thing I'm using to write down

00:10:02.380 --> 00:10:05.580
 on my chemical theories is really useful for erasing

00:10:05.580 --> 00:10:06.460
 the wrong ones.

00:10:06.460 --> 00:10:07.100
 That's amazing.

00:10:07.100 --> 00:10:07.940
 Yeah.

00:10:07.940 --> 00:10:10.980
 The guy who thought of first putting a rubber

00:10:10.980 --> 00:10:15.060
 on the end of a pencil was a guy called Hyman Lipman.

00:10:15.060 --> 00:10:17.300
 This-- what are you laughing at?

00:10:17.300 --> 00:10:21.700
 Well, Hyman is a perfectly normal name, absolutely.

00:10:21.700 --> 00:10:24.940
 This was in 1862, and he came up with this idea,

00:10:24.940 --> 00:10:27.020
 put a rubber on a pencil, brilliant idea.

00:10:27.020 --> 00:10:29.820
 He sold his patent to a guy called Joseph Rockendorfer

00:10:29.820 --> 00:10:31.900
 for $100,000.

00:10:31.900 --> 00:10:34.660
 And then Rockendorfer thought, ah, I've got the patent now.

00:10:34.660 --> 00:10:37.860
 He started suing everyone else who was making them.

00:10:37.860 --> 00:10:40.820
 But the Supreme Court of the United States ruled against him

00:10:40.820 --> 00:10:43.300
 saying that the patent was invalid because actually,

00:10:43.300 --> 00:10:44.980
 he was just taking two other inventions

00:10:44.980 --> 00:10:46.380
 and sticking them together.

00:10:46.380 --> 00:10:48.780
 And so he paid $100,000 for nothing.

00:10:48.780 --> 00:10:49.940
 So two inventions stuck together

00:10:49.940 --> 00:10:51.220
 doesn't constitute a new invention.

00:10:51.220 --> 00:10:52.140
 No, why?

00:10:52.140 --> 00:10:53.140
 Nothing.

00:10:53.140 --> 00:10:55.780
 [LAUGHTER]

00:10:55.780 --> 00:10:58.060
 Don't get excited about the mouse trap remote control,

00:10:58.060 --> 00:10:59.060
 anytime soon.

00:10:59.060 --> 00:11:02.860
 [LAUGHTER]

00:11:02.860 --> 00:11:04.420
 OK, time for fact number two.

00:11:04.420 --> 00:11:05.460
 And that is my fact.

00:11:05.460 --> 00:11:07.860
 My fact this week is drinking alcohol

00:11:07.860 --> 00:11:09.380
 makes you more attractive.

00:11:09.380 --> 00:11:12.500
 It's something that they discovered fairly recently.

00:11:12.500 --> 00:11:14.140
 And they did this with test studies with students.

00:11:14.140 --> 00:11:16.100
 So if you drink a glass of alcohol,

00:11:16.100 --> 00:11:18.180
 it makes your face more attractive.

00:11:18.180 --> 00:11:20.620
 But then if you drink another, then you reduce yourself

00:11:20.620 --> 00:11:21.740
 again back to--

00:11:21.740 --> 00:11:23.260
 No, it's-- yeah, so it's basically.

00:11:23.260 --> 00:11:24.860
 They say that it just relaxes your face,

00:11:24.860 --> 00:11:26.420
 a glass of alcohol relaxes your face,

00:11:26.420 --> 00:11:27.700
 and makes you seem more sexy.

00:11:27.700 --> 00:11:28.220
 Is that--

00:11:28.220 --> 00:11:30.100
 You can't see me back home, but the audience is going,

00:11:30.100 --> 00:11:33.500
 whoa, I didn't know Captain Sexy was in the room.

00:11:33.500 --> 00:11:36.220
 It's one thing about faces that the more relaxed they are,

00:11:36.220 --> 00:11:37.820
 the sexier they are.

00:11:37.820 --> 00:11:42.420
 That's why Slack drawed people famously gorgeous.

00:11:42.420 --> 00:11:43.940
 Well, there are a couple of theories, aren't they?

00:11:43.940 --> 00:11:47.420
 Because it could be that your pupils get larger

00:11:47.420 --> 00:11:48.940
 after a glass of wine, when people--

00:11:48.940 --> 00:11:50.020
 that's the sign of attraction.

00:11:50.020 --> 00:11:52.660
 So you look more attractive if you have very large pupils.

00:11:52.660 --> 00:11:54.540
 Or it could be the other theories possible

00:11:54.540 --> 00:11:56.140
 that your cheeks get a bit rosier.

00:11:56.140 --> 00:11:58.620
 And that's the sort of sign of vitality and health

00:11:58.620 --> 00:11:59.820
 and all of this stuff, so.

00:11:59.820 --> 00:12:00.420
 It is worth it.

00:12:00.420 --> 00:12:01.820
 It's only one glass of wine, though.

00:12:01.820 --> 00:12:03.220
 I mean, I can't believe people's physical appearance

00:12:03.220 --> 00:12:05.980
 changes that much between one glass of wine,

00:12:05.980 --> 00:12:08.260
 one glasses of wine, and I've had too many actually.

00:12:08.260 --> 00:12:09.900
 [LAUGHTER]

00:12:09.900 --> 00:12:14.540
 Your glass is a very large, though, I don't know.

00:12:14.540 --> 00:12:16.420
 There was a study done about beer goggles as well

00:12:16.420 --> 00:12:18.540
 that they gave people alcohol and they

00:12:18.540 --> 00:12:20.500
 asked them to rate people's faces.

00:12:20.500 --> 00:12:23.740
 And they said it was a roughly 10% increase in ratings

00:12:23.740 --> 00:12:25.900
 of attractiveness when you got drunk compared to when

00:12:25.900 --> 00:12:27.980
 you were sober, so that was supposedly

00:12:27.980 --> 00:12:30.100
 to prove that beer goggles exist.

00:12:30.100 --> 00:12:34.180
 There was also a study where people were split into four groups.

00:12:34.180 --> 00:12:37.300
 So basically this study showed that people, when they're drunk,

00:12:37.300 --> 00:12:38.420
 think they're more attractive.

00:12:38.420 --> 00:12:39.980
 So they're asked to look at pictures of themselves,

00:12:39.980 --> 00:12:41.420
 if it is themselves, and if they're a bit pissed,

00:12:41.420 --> 00:12:42.740
 they're like, yeah, I'm really hot.

00:12:42.740 --> 00:12:45.660
 But people who think they're drunk, but aren't drunk,

00:12:45.660 --> 00:12:47.740
 still think they're more attractive.

00:12:47.740 --> 00:12:51.340
 So they gave people what they said was six shots of vodka.

00:12:51.340 --> 00:12:52.780
 And then it wasn't vodka.

00:12:52.780 --> 00:12:54.940
 It was just water that smells a bit like vodka.

00:12:54.940 --> 00:12:56.460
 And then they asked them to watch a video themselves,

00:12:56.460 --> 00:12:58.500
 and they operated their attractiveness.

00:12:58.500 --> 00:13:00.820
 Because they obviously convinced themselves they were drunk.

00:13:00.820 --> 00:13:03.180
 And then thought, well, when I'm drunk, I become more attractive.

00:13:03.180 --> 00:13:04.740
 So isn't that interesting?

00:13:04.740 --> 00:13:05.700
 That was really cool.

00:13:05.700 --> 00:13:08.820
 I mean, we said that some of the animal experiments

00:13:08.820 --> 00:13:11.660
 were quite cruel, but I think giving people water and saying

00:13:11.660 --> 00:13:14.540
 it's vodka is about as cruel as you can get.

00:13:14.540 --> 00:13:16.340
 I'd be suing.

00:13:16.340 --> 00:13:18.820
 Six shots is an awful lot, isn't it?

00:13:18.820 --> 00:13:20.300
 Oh, Andy.

00:13:20.300 --> 00:13:22.620
 [LAUGHTER]

00:13:22.620 --> 00:13:24.180
 It was with me, temperance guys.

00:13:24.180 --> 00:13:26.500
 [LAUGHTER]

00:13:26.500 --> 00:13:29.700
 But what if all alcohol was just replaced by placebo alcohol

00:13:29.700 --> 00:13:31.820
 and no one told us?

00:13:31.820 --> 00:13:32.820
 Yeah.

00:13:32.820 --> 00:13:34.740
 And we just have the same-- it would just be exactly the same.

00:13:34.740 --> 00:13:36.660
 If we think we're drunk, when we're not,

00:13:36.660 --> 00:13:38.740
 they could just save all that money making alcohol.

00:13:38.740 --> 00:13:40.580
 Yeah, it's just the kind of stuff that smells and tastes

00:13:40.580 --> 00:13:41.900
 a bit like alcohol, and then--

00:13:41.900 --> 00:13:43.220
 They've been doing it for the last 10 years.

00:13:43.220 --> 00:13:46.220
 I was part of the committee that decided.

00:13:46.220 --> 00:13:49.260
 Mine is real, but you're guys.

00:13:49.260 --> 00:13:52.100
 There's also a study that showed that men rate pictures.

00:13:52.100 --> 00:13:54.220
 So yeah, we think people are more attractive when we're

00:13:54.220 --> 00:13:58.420
 a bit drunk, and men even rate women more attractively

00:13:58.420 --> 00:14:01.380
 when they look at pictures of them when they are red alcohol-related

00:14:01.380 --> 00:14:02.380
 words.

00:14:02.380 --> 00:14:03.580
 No.

00:14:03.580 --> 00:14:05.420
 If you say the word "beer" to a man and then

00:14:05.420 --> 00:14:06.620
 put a picture of a woman in front of him,

00:14:06.620 --> 00:14:10.980
 he's like, oh, yeah, she's hotter than she was five minutes ago.

00:14:10.980 --> 00:14:13.940
 So if you felt that you were slightly unattractive in life,

00:14:13.940 --> 00:14:16.980
 you could just rename yourself whiskey, or--

00:14:16.980 --> 00:14:17.900
 Hello, I'm beer.

00:14:17.900 --> 00:14:18.900
 Lovely to meet you.

00:14:18.900 --> 00:14:19.940
 Well, hello, beer.

00:14:19.940 --> 00:14:21.420
 Lovely to meet you.

00:14:21.420 --> 00:14:22.020
 Really?

00:14:22.020 --> 00:14:23.060
 Yeah, I think that's a really good idea.

00:14:23.060 --> 00:14:24.660
 Oh, my God.

00:14:24.660 --> 00:14:26.100
 I found out about another study.

00:14:26.100 --> 00:14:28.580
 This is a 2013 study by a group.

00:14:28.580 --> 00:14:31.380
 I think it was a German scientist.

00:14:31.380 --> 00:14:33.260
 How to get a bartender's attention.

00:14:33.260 --> 00:14:35.020
 The results revealed that bar staff responded

00:14:35.020 --> 00:14:37.500
 to a set of two non-verbal signals.

00:14:37.500 --> 00:14:38.020
 Well, exciting.

00:14:38.020 --> 00:14:39.540
 What are these signals going to be?

00:14:39.540 --> 00:14:42.180
 First, customers position themselves directly

00:14:42.180 --> 00:14:43.900
 at the bar counter.

00:14:43.900 --> 00:14:46.860
 [LAUGHTER]

00:14:46.860 --> 00:14:49.860
 And secondly, they look at a member of staff.

00:14:49.860 --> 00:14:53.220
 [LAUGHTER]

00:14:53.220 --> 00:14:55.300
 Because I have been doing it wrong for years.

00:14:55.300 --> 00:14:58.260
 You've been stood outside looking at a horse.

00:14:58.260 --> 00:15:00.420
 [LAUGHTER]

00:15:00.420 --> 00:15:03.260
 And so fruit flies use alcohol as medicine.

00:15:03.260 --> 00:15:07.060
 They are often attacked by parasitic wasps who kind of lay eggs in them

00:15:07.060 --> 00:15:10.020
 and then eat them from the inside when they're born.

00:15:10.020 --> 00:15:13.420
 But what they can do is they can drink loads and loads and loads

00:15:13.420 --> 00:15:14.460
 and loads of alcohol.

00:15:14.460 --> 00:15:17.100
 And the alcohol kills the wasps, but it doesn't kill them

00:15:17.100 --> 00:15:18.180
 because they're like hard.

00:15:18.180 --> 00:15:20.500
 They're not like you, Andy.

00:15:20.500 --> 00:15:21.700
 They can take it.

00:15:21.700 --> 00:15:25.900
 But even better is when they'll even see a parasitic wasp,

00:15:25.900 --> 00:15:30.500
 they will play the children with alcohol to save them as well.

00:15:30.500 --> 00:15:32.700
 That's what they're telling the social workers, is it?

00:15:32.700 --> 00:15:35.580
 [LAUGHTER]

00:15:35.580 --> 00:15:38.740
 I read another slightly interesting science report,

00:15:38.740 --> 00:15:42.100
 which is that our faces look better from behind.

00:15:42.100 --> 00:15:45.260
 So apparently, when you see someone from behind,

00:15:45.260 --> 00:15:47.460
 you picture what their face looks like.

00:15:47.460 --> 00:15:49.380
 And you project this face onto a person.

00:15:49.380 --> 00:15:51.220
 And ultimately, it's usually disappointing

00:15:51.220 --> 00:15:54.380
 when the person turns around according to scientists.

00:15:54.380 --> 00:15:57.540
 And so they've said the best view for any human

00:15:57.540 --> 00:15:59.780
 is from behind of a face.

00:15:59.780 --> 00:16:00.860
 Yeah.

00:16:00.860 --> 00:16:03.940
 Also, I found this just quite funny.

00:16:03.940 --> 00:16:07.180
 You know, there's that whole concept of a wingman.

00:16:07.180 --> 00:16:10.220
 Frogs invented the idea of wingmaning.

00:16:10.220 --> 00:16:12.100
 So I read this report where apparently,

00:16:12.100 --> 00:16:13.700
 and they did this test on, I think,

00:16:13.700 --> 00:16:16.460
 it was 120 female frogs and a couple of guys.

00:16:16.460 --> 00:16:17.220
 And so--

00:16:17.220 --> 00:16:18.220
 A couple of guys.

00:16:18.220 --> 00:16:20.060
 A couple of male frogs, you mean?

00:16:20.060 --> 00:16:21.980
 Couple of man frogs, yeah.

00:16:21.980 --> 00:16:25.340
 And so the man frogs would come into the bar.

00:16:25.340 --> 00:16:29.860
 And one of the man frogs would bring an ugly mate,

00:16:29.860 --> 00:16:30.860
 as the scientists call it.

00:16:30.860 --> 00:16:33.860
 And the ugly mate would come in, and it'd make the other frog

00:16:33.860 --> 00:16:36.180
 look better looking, and then the other female frogs

00:16:36.180 --> 00:16:38.260
 would be like, oh, who's the good looking?

00:16:38.260 --> 00:16:40.380
 Yeah, I always take a slug to a bar.

00:16:40.380 --> 00:16:43.620
 [LAUGHTER]

00:16:43.620 --> 00:16:45.060
 It works pretty badly.

00:16:45.060 --> 00:16:47.220
 [LAUGHTER]

00:16:47.220 --> 00:16:49.820
 Everyone who's getting off with the slug is tricky, but--

00:16:49.820 --> 00:16:53.780
 [LAUGHTER]

00:16:53.780 --> 00:16:55.380
 We're going to have to move on.

00:16:55.380 --> 00:16:57.340
 OK, it's time for fact number three.

00:16:57.340 --> 00:16:58.780
 And that is James Harkin.

00:16:58.780 --> 00:17:02.820
 OK, my fact this week is that the National Giant Vegetable

00:17:02.820 --> 00:17:07.060
 Championships had to move venue in the mid-80s as the pumpkins

00:17:07.060 --> 00:17:09.540
 started getting too big to fit through the doors.

00:17:09.540 --> 00:17:11.180
 [LAUGHTER]

00:17:11.180 --> 00:17:14.180
 Sorry, I just find that so funny.

00:17:14.180 --> 00:17:14.980
 Let's--

00:17:14.980 --> 00:17:16.780
 Do we know how big the doors were?

00:17:16.780 --> 00:17:17.940
 Yeah, it was a pub.

00:17:17.940 --> 00:17:20.780
 It was called the Milk Haven, it's in Cumbran.

00:17:20.780 --> 00:17:23.740
 And so it's a proper double swinging doors.

00:17:23.740 --> 00:17:26.540
 And in the mid-80s, yeah, they had to move it,

00:17:26.540 --> 00:17:30.100
 and then it moved to the Cumbran Working Men's Club, which

00:17:30.100 --> 00:17:32.500
 presumably just had bigger doors.

00:17:32.500 --> 00:17:34.060
 Where is Cumbran, sorry?

00:17:34.060 --> 00:17:35.060
 It's in South Wales.

00:17:35.060 --> 00:17:35.860
 OK.

00:17:35.860 --> 00:17:37.780
 So how big were these pumpkins?

00:17:37.780 --> 00:17:40.060
 Oh, well, I'm not sure how big they were then.

00:17:40.060 --> 00:17:44.620
 The heaviest pumpkin in history weighed 1,054 kilograms,

00:17:44.620 --> 00:17:47.620
 which is about the same weight as the Ford Fiesta.

00:17:47.620 --> 00:17:49.700
 But let's practical for the commuter.

00:17:49.700 --> 00:17:53.020
 [LAUGHTER]

00:17:53.020 --> 00:17:57.580
 Just at midnight going, this hasn't changed at all.

00:17:57.580 --> 00:18:00.140
 It was grown by Benny Meyer from Switzerland,

00:18:00.140 --> 00:18:02.060
 and it was according to the Guinness Book of Records,

00:18:02.060 --> 00:18:05.900
 it was authenticated by the great pumpkin commonwealth.

00:18:05.900 --> 00:18:12.100
 I was reading today on Pumpkin.com that apparently they--

00:18:12.100 --> 00:18:15.260
 this is new thing for Halloween now, whereby people actively

00:18:15.260 --> 00:18:16.900
 want ugly-looking pumpkins.

00:18:16.900 --> 00:18:19.500
 And they've been trying to breed out ugly-looking pumpkins

00:18:19.500 --> 00:18:21.500
 for a very long time, because anyone buying a pumpkin

00:18:21.500 --> 00:18:22.940
 wants a good-looking pumpkin.

00:18:22.940 --> 00:18:26.660
 Now a sort of warty-looking, disfigured pumpkin

00:18:26.660 --> 00:18:27.540
 is all the rage.

00:18:27.540 --> 00:18:29.940
 And so they actually-- it's a very lucrative business

00:18:29.940 --> 00:18:31.900
 at the moment to mess up your pumpkins,

00:18:31.900 --> 00:18:35.980
 to make him look a bit odd from one day of the year.

00:18:35.980 --> 00:18:38.220
 The ugly-warty pumpkins are very popular

00:18:38.220 --> 00:18:40.460
 with the good-looking pumpkins who take them to bars.

00:18:40.460 --> 00:18:42.620
 [LAUGHTER]

00:18:42.620 --> 00:18:44.860
 No, these giant pumpkins, they are amazing.

00:18:44.860 --> 00:18:47.060
 They grow them on pallets, as in they

00:18:47.060 --> 00:18:49.580
 put a pallet underneath the ground while it grows,

00:18:49.580 --> 00:18:51.180
 so that once it's got big enough, they

00:18:51.180 --> 00:18:53.940
 can get a four-cliff truck down and put it under the ground

00:18:53.940 --> 00:18:57.100
 and lift it up, because otherwise it'll just burst or explode.

00:18:57.100 --> 00:18:59.300
 I read an account of a guy who managed to--

00:18:59.300 --> 00:19:02.500
 he put a four-cliff truck fork, the roux, his pumpkin.

00:19:02.500 --> 00:19:03.220
 Oh, my God.

00:19:03.220 --> 00:19:05.500
 As he was taking it to the competition.

00:19:05.500 --> 00:19:06.620
 Does that-- oh, my God.

00:19:06.620 --> 00:19:08.780
 Oh, my God.

00:19:08.780 --> 00:19:10.380
 There's a guy called Clive Bevan.

00:19:10.380 --> 00:19:11.780
 He grows giant pumpkins.

00:19:11.780 --> 00:19:16.820
 And in 2011, he donated some to be crushed by a monster truck

00:19:16.820 --> 00:19:18.180
 at a charity event.

00:19:18.180 --> 00:19:20.180
 And I don't think there's a better evening out

00:19:20.180 --> 00:19:23.540
 than watching a giant truck crush a giant pumpkin.

00:19:23.540 --> 00:19:24.340
 Yeah.

00:19:24.340 --> 00:19:25.780
 It's not amazing.

00:19:25.780 --> 00:19:28.660
 He's been sort of poached by the Malaysian government

00:19:28.660 --> 00:19:30.540
 to grow giant pumpkins for them.

00:19:30.540 --> 00:19:32.060
 And the ones who grew there, they're way

00:19:32.060 --> 00:19:34.980
 about 20 stone, and they have to be moved by helicopter.

00:19:34.980 --> 00:19:38.260
 There was a study done about how big pumpkins can get.

00:19:38.260 --> 00:19:42.100
 And they put a lot of pumpkins in like this weird vice

00:19:42.100 --> 00:19:45.340
 instrument, and they saw how much pressure it could get.

00:19:45.340 --> 00:19:47.740
 And they worked out that in a perfect world,

00:19:47.740 --> 00:19:51.060
 you could get a pumpkin that was 20,000 pounds,

00:19:51.060 --> 00:19:53.540
 which is the size of two elephants.

00:19:53.540 --> 00:19:55.660
 And that's what their skin could hold before it would just

00:19:55.660 --> 00:19:56.260
 give up.

00:19:56.260 --> 00:19:58.420
 That does sound like a perfect world, James.

00:19:58.420 --> 00:20:05.500
 This is why I never won Miss World.

00:20:05.500 --> 00:20:14.060
 The longest carrot ever was 19 feet long.

00:20:14.060 --> 00:20:15.460
 Whoa.

00:20:15.460 --> 00:20:17.460
 And the longest beetroot, 21 feet.

00:20:17.460 --> 00:20:20.980
 Longest part of ever, 18 feet, five inches.

00:20:20.980 --> 00:20:22.620
 What they do is they grow them in pipes.

00:20:22.620 --> 00:20:25.580
 So you get a very long pipe, and you grow it along that.

00:20:25.580 --> 00:20:27.180
 And it's very, very hard to get them out of the soil

00:20:27.180 --> 00:20:27.980
 without breaking them.

00:20:27.980 --> 00:20:30.260
 And also, you don't know how well you've done,

00:20:30.260 --> 00:20:30.940
 until you pick them.

00:20:30.940 --> 00:20:33.740
 That's the exciting thing about growing them.

00:20:33.740 --> 00:20:35.900
 [LAUGHTER]

00:20:35.900 --> 00:20:37.380
 So they're like icebergs now.

00:20:37.380 --> 00:20:38.860
 They're just thinking, you could grow them.

00:20:38.860 --> 00:20:39.660
 So that's a lettuces.

00:20:39.660 --> 00:20:40.180
 Oh, sorry.

00:20:40.180 --> 00:20:41.180
 Yes.

00:20:41.180 --> 00:20:42.180
 Yeah.

00:20:42.180 --> 00:20:44.940
 [APPLAUSE]

00:20:44.940 --> 00:20:47.140
 Do you know who grew those?

00:20:47.140 --> 00:20:50.540
 Because there's one man who's held the world records

00:20:50.540 --> 00:20:54.700
 for the largest broccoli kale carrot cabbage,

00:20:54.700 --> 00:20:57.540
 red cabbage, celery, and beet fruit.

00:20:57.540 --> 00:20:58.260
 Whoa.

00:20:58.260 --> 00:21:01.460
 And I don't know how he holds down a day job.

00:21:01.460 --> 00:21:03.900
 But he's called John Evans from Alaska,

00:21:03.900 --> 00:21:05.820
 and he's broken all of those records.

00:21:05.820 --> 00:21:07.940
 Alaska, Alaska is the place to grow giant vegetables.

00:21:07.940 --> 00:21:11.300
 Because in the summer months, you get 20 hours of sunshine a day.

00:21:11.300 --> 00:21:12.580
 And so they grow really large, because they

00:21:12.580 --> 00:21:14.060
 do more photosynthesizing.

00:21:14.060 --> 00:21:15.900
 So if you want to grow-- if you want to beat records,

00:21:15.900 --> 00:21:16.620
 move to Alaska.

00:21:16.620 --> 00:21:17.980
 It's amazing it started in Wales, which

00:21:17.980 --> 00:21:22.020
 gets about half an hour of sunshine a day.

00:21:22.020 --> 00:21:24.500
 Can I turn the conversation to doors?

00:21:24.500 --> 00:21:29.580
 So it's relevant, right?

00:21:29.580 --> 00:21:32.940
 That's three days on doors.com.

00:21:32.940 --> 00:21:36.460
 I'm not go wasted.

00:21:36.460 --> 00:21:41.140
 So one thing that I found out, which I found amazing,

00:21:41.140 --> 00:21:42.380
 is that we always have the impression

00:21:42.380 --> 00:21:43.940
 that people were smaller back in the day

00:21:43.940 --> 00:21:45.380
 because of the height of doors.

00:21:45.380 --> 00:21:46.940
 Yeah, you would go to old British pubs,

00:21:46.940 --> 00:21:48.100
 and the doors would be quite low.

00:21:48.100 --> 00:21:50.180
 And we thought, wow, everyone was so small back then.

00:21:50.180 --> 00:21:51.100
 That's not true.

00:21:51.100 --> 00:21:53.420
 It's in fact, it's that it was just doors cost a lot.

00:21:53.420 --> 00:21:54.260
 It was a shrunk.

00:21:54.260 --> 00:21:55.380
 Yeah, the doors of sunshine.

00:21:55.380 --> 00:21:58.540
 No, doors were quite a costly material back in the day.

00:21:58.540 --> 00:22:00.820
 So why would you have a ginormous door in your house?

00:22:00.820 --> 00:22:03.260
 You would just build something quite small that you could get into.

00:22:03.260 --> 00:22:03.860
 And--

00:22:03.860 --> 00:22:06.700
 I guess also, if it was smaller, it would be less heat-syscaping.

00:22:06.700 --> 00:22:07.220
 Yes.

00:22:07.220 --> 00:22:08.500
 So maybe a better--

00:22:08.500 --> 00:22:10.700
 The revolving door was invented by a man

00:22:10.700 --> 00:22:12.980
 who hated holding doors open for women.

00:22:12.980 --> 00:22:15.340
 [LAUGHTER]

00:22:15.340 --> 00:22:16.180
 Really?

00:22:16.180 --> 00:22:19.220
 Yeah, he was called Fear Filer's Fun Kennel.

00:22:19.220 --> 00:22:21.740
 But the great thing about this guy, he has a Wikipedia page.

00:22:21.740 --> 00:22:24.900
 He has loads of articles about him in all sorts of newspapers.

00:22:24.900 --> 00:22:29.340
 But in only one place can I find that he had only one arm.

00:22:29.340 --> 00:22:32.020
 And nowhere else mentions that he only had one arm.

00:22:32.020 --> 00:22:32.540
 Wow.

00:22:32.540 --> 00:22:34.220
 You think that'd be the first thing, right?

00:22:34.220 --> 00:22:36.660
 Yeah, as much as it explains his aversion

00:22:36.660 --> 00:22:38.220
 to opening doors for people.

00:22:38.220 --> 00:22:41.060
 [LAUGHTER]

00:22:41.060 --> 00:22:43.100
 Actually, a conventional door took his other arm.

00:22:43.100 --> 00:22:45.460
 [LAUGHTER]

00:22:45.460 --> 00:22:50.580
 There is a-- I have read a manual on taxidermy, which says,

00:22:50.580 --> 00:22:54.020
 do not make sure the doors of your taxidermy workshop

00:22:54.020 --> 00:22:56.340
 are large enough to get out the animals that you are.

00:22:56.340 --> 00:22:58.620
 Because there was one guy who had a bad experience

00:22:58.620 --> 00:23:01.300
 with an elephant, a genuinely stuffed an elephant,

00:23:01.300 --> 00:23:03.060
 and then could not get it out of his workshop.

00:23:03.060 --> 00:23:04.940
 How did he get it in there?

00:23:04.940 --> 00:23:06.740
 I don't know.

00:23:06.740 --> 00:23:09.420
 I think maybe he raised it in there and killed us there.

00:23:09.420 --> 00:23:14.020
 [LAUGHTER]

00:23:14.020 --> 00:23:15.540
 Do you know that the automatic door

00:23:15.540 --> 00:23:18.140
 was invented a very long time ago?

00:23:18.140 --> 00:23:21.260
 Like, so we think of it as probably quite a modern invention,

00:23:21.260 --> 00:23:23.020
 and absolutely the sort of modern--

00:23:23.020 --> 00:23:24.100
 Because it's electric.

00:23:24.100 --> 00:23:25.100
 Yeah, the electric, exactly.

00:23:25.100 --> 00:23:27.020
 The motion sensor thing where you would be.

00:23:27.020 --> 00:23:27.780
 Yeah, exactly.

00:23:27.780 --> 00:23:31.820
 Yeah, but there's evidence that hero/heron of Alexandria

00:23:31.820 --> 00:23:34.260
 actually invented an automatic door using

00:23:34.260 --> 00:23:37.420
 pneumatics and using water and so on in order to get it open

00:23:37.420 --> 00:23:37.700
 and close.

00:23:37.700 --> 00:23:39.020
 He was an amazing guy.

00:23:39.020 --> 00:23:40.140
 This guy was extraordinary.

00:23:40.140 --> 00:23:42.260
 He was a guy who invented--

00:23:42.260 --> 00:23:44.180
 He invented the first vending machine.

00:23:44.180 --> 00:23:45.940
 It was a coin-operated vending machine.

00:23:45.940 --> 00:23:48.100
 He used to teach in the libraries of Alexandria.

00:23:48.100 --> 00:23:49.100
 So this is how old it is.

00:23:49.100 --> 00:23:51.380
 And the first vending machine, you put a coin in it

00:23:51.380 --> 00:23:52.860
 and it gave you some holy water.

00:23:52.860 --> 00:23:53.780
 How cool is that?

00:23:53.780 --> 00:23:54.820
 That's what this guy did.

00:23:54.820 --> 00:23:56.140
 He was like the Steve Jobs of his day.

00:23:56.140 --> 00:23:57.460
 No, I wanted the Mars Bar.

00:23:57.460 --> 00:24:01.060
 [LAUGHTER]

00:24:01.060 --> 00:24:03.740
 OK, it's time for our final fact of the show.

00:24:03.740 --> 00:24:05.780
 And that is Chazinski.

00:24:05.780 --> 00:24:08.900
 Yes, my fact is that the beaded lacewing insect

00:24:08.900 --> 00:24:13.260
 incapacitates its prey by farting on it.

00:24:13.260 --> 00:24:14.900
 So the beaded lacewing is lace wings

00:24:14.900 --> 00:24:17.140
 of those little insects, which are really understudied.

00:24:17.140 --> 00:24:18.380
 Hardly anything is known about them,

00:24:18.380 --> 00:24:20.340
 and they have those transparent wings.

00:24:20.340 --> 00:24:24.660
 So when it's fully grown, it just is a vegetarian, vegan.

00:24:24.660 --> 00:24:28.020
 But as a larva, as a baby, when it's less principled,

00:24:28.020 --> 00:24:31.020
 it is really carnivorous.

00:24:31.020 --> 00:24:35.260
 And so these larvae go around, and they live in termite nests.

00:24:35.260 --> 00:24:37.580
 And they go around and stun termites

00:24:37.580 --> 00:24:41.620
 with vapor-phase toxicon, which they release from their anus.

00:24:41.620 --> 00:24:45.540
 The larva raises its anus up in the air in the termite's face.

00:24:45.540 --> 00:24:47.980
 And excretes this scent.

00:24:47.980 --> 00:24:50.220
 And the termite feels OK for a little bit.

00:24:50.220 --> 00:24:51.860
 Then it becomes immobilized.

00:24:51.860 --> 00:24:54.100
 And then within a couple of minutes, it's kind of fainted.

00:24:54.100 --> 00:24:56.300
 And then it dies after about three hours.

00:24:56.300 --> 00:24:59.180
 And it makes it much easier to pull apart and eat,

00:24:59.180 --> 00:25:01.820
 which is quite an impressive way of killing your victim.

00:25:01.820 --> 00:25:02.740
 I mean, yeah.

00:25:02.740 --> 00:25:03.240
 Yeah.

00:25:03.240 --> 00:25:06.020
 The other thing I read is that these lacewing larvae,

00:25:06.020 --> 00:25:09.740
 are 30 times smaller than the termites that they're eating.

00:25:09.740 --> 00:25:10.780
 Wow.

00:25:10.780 --> 00:25:11.260
 Yeah.

00:25:11.260 --> 00:25:15.220
 It's a real David and Goliath situation.

00:25:15.220 --> 00:25:20.700
 I can't imagine what your Bible class was like.

00:25:20.700 --> 00:25:25.180
 Well, and they can incapacitate six termites in one fart.

00:25:25.180 --> 00:25:26.080
 Wow.

00:25:26.080 --> 00:25:27.980
 So very efficient.

00:25:27.980 --> 00:25:31.380
 On the flip side of using something as a weapon,

00:25:31.380 --> 00:25:35.260
 using your bum as a weapon, I read about a slug in Canada.

00:25:35.260 --> 00:25:37.180
 Careful, you may be talking about a friend of mine.

00:25:37.180 --> 00:25:43.820
 So apparently this slug, when it gets scared,

00:25:43.820 --> 00:25:45.900
 when it gets frightened, it's bum falls off.

00:25:45.900 --> 00:25:47.740
 [LAUGHTER]

00:25:47.740 --> 00:25:51.940
 It's like, boom, it's like, whoa, whoa.

00:25:51.940 --> 00:25:55.020
 Yeah, it's called the Canadian blue-gray tail dropper slug.

00:25:55.020 --> 00:25:56.300
 [LAUGHTER]

00:25:56.300 --> 00:25:58.620
 Yeah, it's bum just falls off.

00:25:58.620 --> 00:26:01.900
 There was a study about whether a farts contain germs.

00:26:01.900 --> 00:26:03.540
 And there are a couple of scientists from Brisbane

00:26:03.540 --> 00:26:04.180
 to study this.

00:26:04.180 --> 00:26:06.100
 They asked a colleague to break wind

00:26:06.100 --> 00:26:10.020
 over two different petri dishes, firstly fully clothed,

00:26:10.020 --> 00:26:12.380
 and then with their pants down.

00:26:12.380 --> 00:26:15.500
 And the second one, trousers down,

00:26:15.500 --> 00:26:18.020
 developed a kind of bacteria that you

00:26:18.020 --> 00:26:20.220
 only find in the gut or on the skin.

00:26:20.220 --> 00:26:22.180
 And a clothing-fulded one didn't grow anything.

00:26:22.180 --> 00:26:25.620
 So the conclusion was, don't fart naked

00:26:25.620 --> 00:26:26.860
 near food that you're doing.

00:26:26.860 --> 00:26:30.300
 [LAUGHTER]

00:26:30.300 --> 00:26:34.300
 You know, I've got to rethink my dinner party strategies.

00:26:34.300 --> 00:26:38.260
 I'm really sorry about last Friday evening, guys.

00:26:38.260 --> 00:26:41.180
 Our farts, human farts, travel at seven miles per hour

00:26:41.180 --> 00:26:43.940
 on a good fart.

00:26:43.940 --> 00:26:46.380
 That's about double walking speed, isn't it?

00:26:46.380 --> 00:26:48.220
 That's why if you've ever tried to chase a fart,

00:26:48.220 --> 00:26:53.180
 but a walking pace, you can't catch up with it.

00:26:53.180 --> 00:26:57.740
 Wait, so someone's farted that way,

00:26:57.740 --> 00:26:59.820
 and you've got after it like a gray hound.

00:26:59.820 --> 00:27:02.020
 Yeah.

00:27:02.020 --> 00:27:05.620
 Yeah, I think those little gray hounds do.

00:27:05.620 --> 00:27:07.580
 So there was a study done that looked

00:27:07.580 --> 00:27:09.540
 about how embarrassed people are and how little

00:27:09.540 --> 00:27:11.100
 they would like to fart in public.

00:27:11.100 --> 00:27:12.900
 Given the set of circumstances.

00:27:12.900 --> 00:27:15.060
 So they were told you could either do a silent and not

00:27:15.060 --> 00:27:15.860
 smelly fart.

00:27:15.860 --> 00:27:18.860
 And most people were like, well, I'll do that one, please.

00:27:18.860 --> 00:27:20.620
 And they were like, the one I least want to do

00:27:20.620 --> 00:27:23.980
 is the really loud, really disgusting one.

00:27:23.980 --> 00:27:28.540
 But that's very different to your dinner party strategy.

00:27:28.540 --> 00:27:29.460
 I was an outlier.

00:27:29.460 --> 00:27:32.460
 They had to discount me from the study.

00:27:32.460 --> 00:27:35.660
 But people are much more reversed to making a noise

00:27:35.660 --> 00:27:37.660
 than doing the smell, I guess, because the noise is more

00:27:37.660 --> 00:27:39.540
 obvious than it comes from you.

00:27:39.540 --> 00:27:42.220
 But people would much rather omit what is actually much more

00:27:42.220 --> 00:27:43.940
 unpleasant for everyone else around you, isn't it?

00:27:43.940 --> 00:27:45.300
 Because no one minds hearing a noise.

00:27:45.300 --> 00:27:46.540
 Well, the interesting thing about that

00:27:46.540 --> 00:27:48.700
 is humans can't really tell where smells come from.

00:27:48.700 --> 00:27:52.180
 It's really hard because you smell in like one dimension.

00:27:52.180 --> 00:27:56.540
 But then there are animals that can smell in stereo like moles.

00:27:56.540 --> 00:27:59.340
 And so if you had a mole sat there next to you, Anna,

00:27:59.340 --> 00:28:02.380
 it would know exactly where the smell came from.

00:28:02.380 --> 00:28:03.380
 But it couldn't tell anyone.

00:28:03.380 --> 00:28:04.540
 That's the tragedy of the mole.

00:28:07.980 --> 00:28:11.180
 So fats are caused by oligosaccharides

00:28:11.180 --> 00:28:12.300
 that are little molecules, and they're

00:28:12.300 --> 00:28:15.140
 eaten by bacteria in your gut.

00:28:15.140 --> 00:28:18.540
 And the bacteria then make tiny little fats, which turn

00:28:18.540 --> 00:28:19.900
 into human fats.

00:28:19.900 --> 00:28:22.020
 So actually, a human fat is thousands

00:28:22.020 --> 00:28:24.180
 of little tiny bacterial fats.

00:28:24.180 --> 00:28:26.220
 That's honestly the best fact I've ever heard in my life.

00:28:26.220 --> 00:28:28.220
 Are you kidding me?

00:28:28.220 --> 00:28:30.820
 We have a collection of life farting on us

00:28:30.820 --> 00:28:33.180
 that we just release it as one big wharf.

00:28:33.180 --> 00:28:34.380
 You got it.

00:28:34.380 --> 00:28:36.900
 So it kind of technically means it's never really your fold.

00:28:37.900 --> 00:28:38.900
 Exactly.

00:28:38.900 --> 00:28:42.180
 You can always blame it on someone else.

00:28:42.180 --> 00:28:44.860
 The 1956 Grand National is quite famous.

00:28:44.860 --> 00:28:46.460
 There's a horse called Devon Locke.

00:28:46.460 --> 00:28:48.860
 And just as it was coming down the final straight,

00:28:48.860 --> 00:28:51.820
 it was miles ahead, and it just collapsed on the floor.

00:28:51.820 --> 00:28:55.300
 But actually, according to the headlad of the stable,

00:28:55.300 --> 00:28:58.620
 he tightened the girth, which is like the strapping

00:28:58.620 --> 00:29:02.940
 of the around the belly of the horse just before the off.

00:29:02.940 --> 00:29:05.420
 He tightened it with one more notch

00:29:05.420 --> 00:29:07.220
 and then another one for good luck.

00:29:07.220 --> 00:29:09.340
 But also, the owner of the horse had already

00:29:09.340 --> 00:29:11.060
 done exactly the same thing.

00:29:11.060 --> 00:29:15.100
 And one theory is that the horse that was miles in the lead

00:29:15.100 --> 00:29:19.140
 collapsed because it farted and massive, massive fart,

00:29:19.140 --> 00:29:20.220
 and then collapsed.

00:29:20.220 --> 00:29:24.660
 Imagine someone doing your belt loops up four notches

00:29:24.660 --> 00:29:26.180
 tighter than you used to.

00:29:26.180 --> 00:29:29.900
 Like, I'm almost breaking wind even thinking about that

00:29:29.900 --> 00:29:30.420
 happening.

00:29:30.420 --> 00:29:35.340
 OK, that's it.

00:29:35.340 --> 00:29:36.340
 That's all of our facts.

00:29:36.340 --> 00:29:37.620
