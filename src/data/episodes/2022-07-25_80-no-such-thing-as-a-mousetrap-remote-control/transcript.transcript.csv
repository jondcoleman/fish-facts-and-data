00:00:02,00:00:05,[SPEAKING SPANISH]
00:00:05,00:00:14,"Hello, and welcome to another episode of No Such Thing"
00:00:14,00:00:16,"as a Fish, a weekly podcast this week"
00:00:16,00:00:18,coming to you from the Edinburgh Fringe Festival.
00:00:18,00:00:20,"My name is Dan Schreiber, and joining me"
00:00:20,00:00:22,as ever is the three QILs.
00:00:22,00:00:25,"Please welcome to the stage Andy, Barry,"
00:00:25,00:00:29,"James Harkin, and Anish Zinski."
00:00:29,00:00:30,Oh!
00:00:30,00:00:37,"And once again, we have gathered around the microphones"
00:00:37,00:00:39,"with our four favorite facts from the last seven days,"
00:00:39,00:00:41,and no particular order.
00:00:41,00:00:43,"Here we go, starting with you."
00:00:43,00:00:44,Andy Murray.
00:00:44,00:00:47,"Andy, my name is Andy."
00:00:47,00:00:49,My fact this week is that the first ever pencils
00:00:49,00:00:53,we used to draw on sheep.
00:00:53,00:00:55,The fact-- and I found this out last month
00:00:55,00:00:59,"at the Cumberland Pencil Museum, which is an amazing museum."
00:00:59,00:01:02,"If you're ever in the area, you have to go."
00:01:02,00:01:04,"It's in Kessik, and it features, among many other things,"
00:01:04,00:01:08,"a giant collage of Chris Evans made of pencils,"
00:01:08,00:01:10,which is the most nightmare-ish thing you could--
00:01:10,00:01:13,it's so amazing.
00:01:13,00:01:14,"Yeah, so first pencils we used for sheep."
00:01:14,00:01:15,Why?
00:01:15,00:01:16,So why?
00:01:16,00:01:18,"Well, I mean, the story is, and it's not"
00:01:18,00:01:20,"sure how much this is sort of half-myth,"
00:01:20,00:01:22,"but the story is that some shepherds found a load of graphite,"
00:01:22,00:01:24,which had been turfed up in a storm.
00:01:24,00:01:27,"The tree had been blown out, and there was this sort of black"
00:01:27,00:01:28,shiny stuff in the roots.
00:01:28,00:01:30,"And they realized that it made marks and stuff,"
00:01:30,00:01:33,and that's how they started using it to draw on their sheep.
00:01:33,00:01:35,And the first ever pencils were just lumps of graphite wrapped
00:01:35,00:01:36,in sheep skin.
00:01:36,00:01:37,"OK, that's good."
00:01:37,00:01:39,I did slightly have an impression
00:01:39,00:01:40,"that they were sort of riding, you know,"
00:01:40,00:01:44,"novels, and then they just hand your sheep into a publisher."
00:01:44,00:01:46,"Yeah, there you go."
00:01:46,00:01:49,So when did someone decide that we can now take it off sheep
00:01:49,00:01:50,and put it into other uses?
00:01:50,00:01:53,"Well, that initial discovery was in the 16th century."
00:01:53,00:01:55,And there are some people who say that it went back earlier.
00:01:55,00:01:57,People say that the Aztecs might have found it
00:01:57,00:01:59,"and used it as a market a few hundred years before,"
00:01:59,00:02:00,but there isn't too much evidence about that.
00:02:00,00:02:03,"Yeah, but it was a massive market, wasn't it, the graphite?"
00:02:03,00:02:04,"Like, if you stole graphite, you would"
00:02:04,00:02:06,be sent to Australia as punishment.
00:02:06,00:02:08,"Yeah, and they used to have, like, armed guards,"
00:02:08,00:02:11,shaperoning their horses and carts with a graphite down
00:02:11,00:02:12,"to London, didn't they, from Cambodia?"
00:02:12,00:02:14,"Yeah, and even the miners, as you were mining it,"
00:02:14,00:02:17,you would have two men with blunderbosses next to you
00:02:17,00:02:19,to make sure you weren't slipping it into your pockets.
00:02:19,00:02:21,It is kind of extraordinary.
00:02:21,00:02:23,And so there was this naturally occurring graphite
00:02:23,00:02:26,that was found in Borodale in the Lake District.
00:02:26,00:02:30,And that's the only big source of solid graphite
00:02:30,00:02:31,that's ever been found.
00:02:31,00:02:34,"So we, I mean, Britain controlled the pencil industry"
00:02:34,00:02:35,for some time.
00:02:35,00:02:36,"Yeah, we were nailing that."
00:02:36,00:02:38,"It was huge, that was a massive deal."
00:02:38,00:02:41,"And, right, now, the Cumberland Pantsam Museum says this,"
00:02:41,00:02:43,and I can't quite believe it.
00:02:43,00:02:46,"They say that in 1650, graphite was briefly more valuable"
00:02:46,00:02:47,than gold.
00:02:47,00:02:49,But what they did was they deliberately
00:02:49,00:02:52,only mined it for short amounts of time in the year
00:02:52,00:02:54,to kind of keep the price up.
00:02:54,00:02:56,"Because we have this monopoly on it,"
00:02:56,00:02:57,"and we've sent it all the way around the world,"
00:02:57,00:02:59,and they just wanted to keep the price as high as possible.
00:02:59,00:03:01,"Oh, clever."
00:03:01,00:03:03,"But now, hasn't it now turned once again"
00:03:03,00:03:05,into one of the most expensive materials in the world?
00:03:05,00:03:08,"Yeah, the pencils are more expensive than gold."
00:03:08,00:03:09,"Yeah, yeah."
00:03:09,00:03:10,"No, no."
00:03:10,00:03:11,But so--
00:03:11,00:03:14,"And a few here, I'll sell to you after the show."
00:03:14,00:03:17,We met-- James and I have actually met a guy whose--
00:03:17,00:03:20,"his name's Andre Geim, and he discovered--"
00:03:20,00:03:23,"so he's a scientist, but he does all sorts of interesting"
00:03:23,00:03:23,science things.
00:03:23,00:03:25,"For example, they had the biggest-- what was it?"
00:03:25,00:03:27,The biggest magnet in the world.
00:03:27,00:03:29,"Yeah, he made a frog levitate."
00:03:29,00:03:33,"So basically, he was passing the biggest magnet in the world,"
00:03:33,00:03:34,"and he thought, oh, that's a pretty big magnet."
00:03:34,00:03:36,I wonder what would happen if you something went into it.
00:03:36,00:03:39,"So he threw his ham sandwich into it, and it floated."
00:03:39,00:03:41,It just floated inside this magnet.
00:03:41,00:03:43,And then he won an award for floating a frog inside it.
00:03:43,00:03:46,Do you think sheep and frogs have a mutual support group
00:03:46,00:03:50,where they discuss what people have subjected them to?
00:03:50,00:03:53,And they drew all over me for 300 years.
00:03:53,00:03:55,"Well, I was levitated between magnets."
00:03:55,00:03:57,Will you say you chucked a ham sandwich in there?
00:03:57,00:03:58,Yeah.
00:03:58,00:03:59,That's an amazingly cavalier use of what
00:03:59,00:04:01,is presumably a really expensive bit of equipment.
00:04:01,00:04:02,I know.
00:04:02,00:04:05,It was a bowl of ham sandwich.
00:04:05,00:04:07,"Yeah, he won a Nick Nobel Prize for that,"
00:04:07,00:04:11,"but then he won a Nobel Prize for discovering graphene,"
00:04:11,00:04:12,which is done.
00:04:12,00:04:13,Which is pencils.
00:04:13,00:04:16,"You know that when you write with them, that bit that comes out?"
00:04:16,00:04:19,"Back to you, James."
00:04:19,00:04:23,"Yeah, it's a layer of carbon, which is basically one atom thick."
00:04:23,00:04:24,"They think it's going to be the future, and they'll"
00:04:24,00:04:25,make all sorts of things out.
00:04:25,00:04:28,And it turns out that it's the strongest material
00:04:28,00:04:30,that we found in the universe.
00:04:30,00:04:33,"Graphene is so strong that if you had a sheet of it,"
00:04:33,00:04:35,I think I read this.
00:04:35,00:04:37,"You could balance an elephant, right?"
00:04:37,00:04:39,And a grown elephant on--
00:04:39,00:04:41,"the elephant is standing on a pencil,"
00:04:41,00:04:44,"and the pencil is pointing down on a sheet of graphene,"
00:04:44,00:04:45,and the graphene won't break.
00:04:45,00:04:47,That's how strong it is.
00:04:47,00:04:49,"How are you lifting the elephant onto the pencil, though?"
00:04:49,00:04:52,I think that's the question.
00:04:52,00:04:55,So you were saying about how long was it until we had pencils?
00:04:55,00:04:57,"Well, actually, graphite is kind of OK,"
00:04:57,00:04:59,"but it wasn't quite good for pencils,"
00:04:59,00:05:01,because it kind of fell apart a little bit.
00:05:01,00:05:05,"And in 1843, an artist called William Brockenden"
00:05:05,00:05:08,"invented a machine, which could press graphite"
00:05:08,00:05:10,"so that you could have actual lead,"
00:05:10,00:05:11,like you would have in pencils.
00:05:11,00:05:14,But that machine actually has had a much better use.
00:05:14,00:05:17,"They found out you could use it to make pills,"
00:05:17,00:05:19,and all the pills that you eat today--
00:05:19,00:05:22,"All the pills, all the many pills I have--"
00:05:22,00:05:23,"I have some in my pocket, which I'm going to sell to Dan,"
00:05:23,00:05:25,I'll bet the show.
00:05:25,00:05:27,"Yeah, all the pills that you take today"
00:05:27,00:05:30,have come because of the invention of pencils.
00:05:30,00:05:31,Wow.
00:05:31,00:05:31,"It's interesting, isn't it?"
00:05:31,00:05:32,Really?
00:05:32,00:05:35,"Oh, and tabloids used to be pills, didn't they?"
00:05:35,00:05:36,"Oh, yeah."
00:05:36,00:05:38,That was the origin of the tabloid.
00:05:38,00:05:42,Pills used to be much harder to swallow back in the days.
00:05:42,00:05:44,"That's-- I wanted to use this as a main fact for the show,"
00:05:44,00:05:46,but bubble wrap was not used as bubble wrap.
00:05:46,00:05:48,It was originally designed as wallpaper.
00:05:48,00:05:50,"And then for years, we're trying to get people"
00:05:50,00:05:53,to buy their futuristic wallpaper.
00:05:53,00:05:55,"And no one liked it, and it sat in an office for ages."
00:05:55,00:05:57,"And then suddenly, someone just went--"
00:05:57,00:05:58,"when we put it in this box, and it worked,"
00:05:58,00:06:00,"and suddenly, that's how the industry grew."
00:06:00,00:06:01,"But they sat there for years, just going,"
00:06:01,00:06:02,what are we going to do with our--
00:06:02,00:06:04,"They sat there for years, just popping the wallpaper."
00:06:04,00:06:06,This is amazing.
00:06:06,00:06:08,No one getting any work done.
00:06:08,00:06:09,Yeah.
00:06:09,00:06:12,"The 2013, they had a thing called the Diagram Prize."
00:06:12,00:06:15,"They have it every year, and it's for the weirdest book title."
00:06:15,00:06:19,"And in that year, the prize was won by a book called"
00:06:19,00:06:22,"Goblin Proofing, One's Chicken Coop."
00:06:22,00:06:25,"But what came second, or what beat to the prize,"
00:06:25,00:06:28,was a book called How to Sharpen Pencils.
00:06:28,00:06:29,It's by David Reese.
00:06:29,00:06:31,And I went on to Amazon to see if I could buy it.
00:06:31,00:06:34,And they have a deal where people who buy the sharpening
00:06:34,00:06:37,pencils book also buy pencil sharpeners
00:06:37,00:06:39,and a set of 12 pencils.
00:06:39,00:06:42,"And you can get them all for 45 pounds, 87."
00:06:42,00:06:44,That's not bad.
00:06:44,00:06:47,It is actually just the shorter version of the title of that book.
00:06:47,00:06:50,So the longer version is a practical and theoretical treatise
00:06:50,00:06:52,on the artisanal craft of pencil sharpening
00:06:52,00:06:54,"for writers, artists, contractors, and flange turners."
00:06:54,00:07:00,It has unbelievably high ratings.
00:07:00,00:07:02,So it has 82 ratings on Amazon.
00:07:02,00:07:05,And more than three-quarters of them are five-star ratings.
00:07:05,00:07:07,"So one rating, the top five-star rating,"
00:07:07,00:07:13,"is headed sharp and to the point, which was nice."
00:07:13,00:07:14,"He also runs the guy who wrote it, David Reese."
00:07:14,00:07:18,"Now runs a pencil sharpener sharpening business,"
00:07:18,00:07:20,where you can send your pencil to him.
00:07:20,00:07:21,Why?
00:07:21,00:07:22,And he'll send it back.
00:07:22,00:07:23,And he will sharpen it.
00:07:23,00:07:24,Wrapped in bubble wrap.
00:07:24,00:07:27,"He says, there's a quote from him."
00:07:27,00:07:30,"He says, I'm sure there's probably somebody in India"
00:07:30,00:07:32,who could sharpen your pencil for less.
00:07:32,00:07:34,But if you want authentic American craftsmanship.
00:07:34,00:07:37,Wow.
00:07:37,00:07:39,"Is it true, the thing about the musing pencils in space?"
00:07:39,00:07:42,"It's true that they did, but the thing that isn't true"
00:07:42,00:07:46,is that America spent billions making a special ball pod pen.
00:07:46,00:07:47,And the Russians just took a pencil.
00:07:47,00:07:49,"Actually, they all just took pencils."
00:07:49,00:07:50,"OK, yeah."
00:07:50,00:07:52,"And then the space pen was developed,"
00:07:52,00:07:55,which was that great pen that you can buy commercially now.
00:07:55,00:07:58,"And a really interesting thing, it was down to that pen"
00:07:58,00:07:59,that both Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin
00:07:59,00:08:03,"were able to get off the moon because, yeah, no one knows"
00:08:03,00:08:05,how important this actually was.
00:08:05,00:08:07,"So as they were on the moon, and it was time for take off,"
00:08:07,00:08:09,"they had the ignition switch, which had to go on"
00:08:09,00:08:12,to set the boosters off to launch back in space.
00:08:12,00:08:15,"And as Buzz Aldrin's flicked it on, it broken half."
00:08:15,00:08:18,"And he thought, oh, that's--"
00:08:18,00:08:21,"I think he didn't say, oh, oh."
00:08:21,00:08:22,What's he daisy?
00:08:22,00:08:25,"Oh, spaghetti, oh."
00:08:25,00:08:27,"So what he did was he took out his pen,"
00:08:27,00:08:31,"and he put it into the switch, and he used that as the switch"
00:08:31,00:08:32,"to get them off the moon, yeah."
00:08:32,00:08:33,"Wow, that's amazing."
00:08:33,00:08:35,I did not know that.
00:08:35,00:08:36,Wow.
00:08:36,00:08:42,The world's largest pencil has a 250 pound eraser on the end.
00:08:42,00:08:45,"The lead is 4,000 pounds in weight."
00:08:45,00:08:47,And the exterior is a perfect yellow hue
00:08:47,00:08:49,of these typical American yellow pencils.
00:08:49,00:08:51,It's from Pennsylvania.
00:08:51,00:08:53,"No, no way."
00:08:53,00:08:57,"Sorry, is it really?"
00:08:57,00:08:59,The graph out is from Pennsylvania.
00:08:59,00:09:00,"Yeah, is it really?"
00:09:00,00:09:01,I never noticed that.
00:09:01,00:09:03,"Oh, my god."
00:09:03,00:09:05,"This is not spelled pencil, but here is it."
00:09:05,00:09:06,Yeah.
00:09:06,00:09:08,"Wait, did you just notice when he said it out loud just then?"
00:09:08,00:09:10,I noticed it when everyone laughed.
00:09:10,00:09:13,Oh.
00:09:13,00:09:15,It'd be a really cool sort of cartoon character
00:09:15,00:09:19,of a vampire with pencils for teach from Pennsylvania.
00:09:19,00:09:21,That'd be great.
00:09:21,00:09:22,Amazing.
00:09:22,00:09:25,They-- the one problem with this massive pencil
00:09:25,00:09:26,that they didn't think of--
00:09:26,00:09:28,"Well, then it can't be lifted by any human."
00:09:28,00:09:31,Is that the one problem?
00:09:31,00:09:33,There was one more problem.
00:09:33,00:09:36,"They said, we thought about making the world's largest pencil"
00:09:36,00:09:38,"sharpener, but we ran out of money."
00:09:38,00:09:44,"Do you know the speaking of having rubbers on them,"
00:09:44,00:09:47,the guy who discovered that rubber could erase pencils?
00:09:47,00:09:50,"So before that, people used to use wet bread, didn't they?"
00:09:50,00:09:51,"Yes, breadcrumbs."
00:09:51,00:09:53,"But the guy who discovered that rubber-- first row,"
00:09:53,00:09:55,that rubber could be used to erase pencil--
00:09:55,00:09:58,also discovered oxygen is priestly.
00:09:58,00:09:59,"Yeah, yeah."
00:09:59,00:10:00,"And he was the first person to write, oh, by the way,"
00:10:00,00:10:02,this rubber thing I'm using to write down
00:10:02,00:10:05,on my chemical theories is really useful for erasing
00:10:05,00:10:06,the wrong ones.
00:10:06,00:10:07,That's amazing.
00:10:07,00:10:07,Yeah.
00:10:07,00:10:10,The guy who thought of first putting a rubber
00:10:10,00:10:15,on the end of a pencil was a guy called Hyman Lipman.
00:10:15,00:10:17,This-- what are you laughing at?
00:10:17,00:10:21,"Well, Hyman is a perfectly normal name, absolutely."
00:10:21,00:10:24,"This was in 1862, and he came up with this idea,"
00:10:24,00:10:27,"put a rubber on a pencil, brilliant idea."
00:10:27,00:10:29,He sold his patent to a guy called Joseph Rockendorfer
00:10:29,00:10:31,"for $100,000."
00:10:31,00:10:34,"And then Rockendorfer thought, ah, I've got the patent now."
00:10:34,00:10:37,He started suing everyone else who was making them.
00:10:37,00:10:40,But the Supreme Court of the United States ruled against him
00:10:40,00:10:43,"saying that the patent was invalid because actually,"
00:10:43,00:10:44,he was just taking two other inventions
00:10:44,00:10:46,and sticking them together.
00:10:46,00:10:48,"And so he paid $100,000 for nothing."
00:10:48,00:10:49,So two inventions stuck together
00:10:49,00:10:51,doesn't constitute a new invention.
00:10:51,00:10:52,"No, why?"
00:10:52,00:10:53,Nothing.
00:10:53,00:10:55,[LAUGHTER]
00:10:55,00:10:58,"Don't get excited about the mouse trap remote control,"
00:10:58,00:10:59,anytime soon.
00:10:59,00:11:02,[LAUGHTER]
00:11:02,00:11:04,"OK, time for fact number two."
00:11:04,00:11:05,And that is my fact.
00:11:05,00:11:07,My fact this week is drinking alcohol
00:11:07,00:11:09,makes you more attractive.
00:11:09,00:11:12,It's something that they discovered fairly recently.
00:11:12,00:11:14,And they did this with test studies with students.
00:11:14,00:11:16,"So if you drink a glass of alcohol,"
00:11:16,00:11:18,it makes your face more attractive.
00:11:18,00:11:20,"But then if you drink another, then you reduce yourself"
00:11:20,00:11:21,again back to--
00:11:21,00:11:23,"No, it's-- yeah, so it's basically."
00:11:23,00:11:24,"They say that it just relaxes your face,"
00:11:24,00:11:26,"a glass of alcohol relaxes your face,"
00:11:26,00:11:27,and makes you seem more sexy.
00:11:27,00:11:28,Is that--
00:11:28,00:11:30,"You can't see me back home, but the audience is going,"
00:11:30,00:11:33,"whoa, I didn't know Captain Sexy was in the room."
00:11:33,00:11:36,"It's one thing about faces that the more relaxed they are,"
00:11:36,00:11:37,the sexier they are.
00:11:37,00:11:42,That's why Slack drawed people famously gorgeous.
00:11:42,00:11:43,"Well, there are a couple of theories, aren't they?"
00:11:43,00:11:47,Because it could be that your pupils get larger
00:11:47,00:11:48,"after a glass of wine, when people--"
00:11:48,00:11:50,that's the sign of attraction.
00:11:50,00:11:52,So you look more attractive if you have very large pupils.
00:11:52,00:11:54,Or it could be the other theories possible
00:11:54,00:11:56,that your cheeks get a bit rosier.
00:11:56,00:11:58,And that's the sort of sign of vitality and health
00:11:58,00:11:59,"and all of this stuff, so."
00:11:59,00:12:00,It is worth it.
00:12:00,00:12:01,"It's only one glass of wine, though."
00:12:01,00:12:03,"I mean, I can't believe people's physical appearance"
00:12:03,00:12:05,"changes that much between one glass of wine,"
00:12:05,00:12:08,"one glasses of wine, and I've had too many actually."
00:12:08,00:12:09,[LAUGHTER]
00:12:09,00:12:14,"Your glass is a very large, though, I don't know."
00:12:14,00:12:16,There was a study done about beer goggles as well
00:12:16,00:12:18,that they gave people alcohol and they
00:12:18,00:12:20,asked them to rate people's faces.
00:12:20,00:12:23,And they said it was a roughly 10% increase in ratings
00:12:23,00:12:25,of attractiveness when you got drunk compared to when
00:12:25,00:12:27,"you were sober, so that was supposedly"
00:12:27,00:12:30,to prove that beer goggles exist.
00:12:30,00:12:34,There was also a study where people were split into four groups.
00:12:34,00:12:37,"So basically this study showed that people, when they're drunk,"
00:12:37,00:12:38,think they're more attractive.
00:12:38,00:12:39,"So they're asked to look at pictures of themselves,"
00:12:39,00:12:41,"if it is themselves, and if they're a bit pissed,"
00:12:41,00:12:42,"they're like, yeah, I'm really hot."
00:12:42,00:12:45,"But people who think they're drunk, but aren't drunk,"
00:12:45,00:12:47,still think they're more attractive.
00:12:47,00:12:51,So they gave people what they said was six shots of vodka.
00:12:51,00:12:52,And then it wasn't vodka.
00:12:52,00:12:54,It was just water that smells a bit like vodka.
00:12:54,00:12:56,"And then they asked them to watch a video themselves,"
00:12:56,00:12:58,and they operated their attractiveness.
00:12:58,00:13:00,Because they obviously convinced themselves they were drunk.
00:13:00,00:13:03,"And then thought, well, when I'm drunk, I become more attractive."
00:13:03,00:13:04,So isn't that interesting?
00:13:04,00:13:05,That was really cool.
00:13:05,00:13:08,"I mean, we said that some of the animal experiments"
00:13:08,00:13:11,"were quite cruel, but I think giving people water and saying"
00:13:11,00:13:14,it's vodka is about as cruel as you can get.
00:13:14,00:13:16,I'd be suing.
00:13:16,00:13:18,"Six shots is an awful lot, isn't it?"
00:13:18,00:13:20,"Oh, Andy."
00:13:20,00:13:22,[LAUGHTER]
00:13:22,00:13:24,"It was with me, temperance guys."
00:13:24,00:13:26,[LAUGHTER]
00:13:26,00:13:29,But what if all alcohol was just replaced by placebo alcohol
00:13:29,00:13:31,and no one told us?
00:13:31,00:13:32,Yeah.
00:13:32,00:13:34,And we just have the same-- it would just be exactly the same.
00:13:34,00:13:36,"If we think we're drunk, when we're not,"
00:13:36,00:13:38,they could just save all that money making alcohol.
00:13:38,00:13:40,"Yeah, it's just the kind of stuff that smells and tastes"
00:13:40,00:13:41,"a bit like alcohol, and then--"
00:13:41,00:13:43,They've been doing it for the last 10 years.
00:13:43,00:13:46,I was part of the committee that decided.
00:13:46,00:13:49,"Mine is real, but you're guys."
00:13:49,00:13:52,There's also a study that showed that men rate pictures.
00:13:52,00:13:54,"So yeah, we think people are more attractive when we're"
00:13:54,00:13:58,"a bit drunk, and men even rate women more attractively"
00:13:58,00:14:01,when they look at pictures of them when they are red alcohol-related
00:14:01,00:14:02,words.
00:14:02,00:14:03,No.
00:14:03,00:14:05,"If you say the word ""beer"" to a man and then"
00:14:05,00:14:06,"put a picture of a woman in front of him,"
00:14:06,00:14:10,"he's like, oh, yeah, she's hotter than she was five minutes ago."
00:14:10,00:14:13,"So if you felt that you were slightly unattractive in life,"
00:14:13,00:14:16,"you could just rename yourself whiskey, or--"
00:14:16,00:14:17,"Hello, I'm beer."
00:14:17,00:14:18,Lovely to meet you.
00:14:18,00:14:19,"Well, hello, beer."
00:14:19,00:14:21,Lovely to meet you.
00:14:21,00:14:22,Really?
00:14:22,00:14:23,"Yeah, I think that's a really good idea."
00:14:23,00:14:24,"Oh, my God."
00:14:24,00:14:26,I found out about another study.
00:14:26,00:14:28,This is a 2013 study by a group.
00:14:28,00:14:31,I think it was a German scientist.
00:14:31,00:14:33,How to get a bartender's attention.
00:14:33,00:14:35,The results revealed that bar staff responded
00:14:35,00:14:37,to a set of two non-verbal signals.
00:14:37,00:14:38,"Well, exciting."
00:14:38,00:14:39,What are these signals going to be?
00:14:39,00:14:42,"First, customers position themselves directly"
00:14:42,00:14:43,at the bar counter.
00:14:43,00:14:46,[LAUGHTER]
00:14:46,00:14:49,"And secondly, they look at a member of staff."
00:14:49,00:14:53,[LAUGHTER]
00:14:53,00:14:55,Because I have been doing it wrong for years.
00:14:55,00:14:58,You've been stood outside looking at a horse.
00:14:58,00:15:00,[LAUGHTER]
00:15:00,00:15:03,And so fruit flies use alcohol as medicine.
00:15:03,00:15:07,They are often attacked by parasitic wasps who kind of lay eggs in them
00:15:07,00:15:10,and then eat them from the inside when they're born.
00:15:10,00:15:13,But what they can do is they can drink loads and loads and loads
00:15:13,00:15:14,and loads of alcohol.
00:15:14,00:15:17,"And the alcohol kills the wasps, but it doesn't kill them"
00:15:17,00:15:18,because they're like hard.
00:15:18,00:15:20,"They're not like you, Andy."
00:15:20,00:15:21,They can take it.
00:15:21,00:15:25,"But even better is when they'll even see a parasitic wasp,"
00:15:25,00:15:30,they will play the children with alcohol to save them as well.
00:15:30,00:15:32,"That's what they're telling the social workers, is it?"
00:15:32,00:15:35,[LAUGHTER]
00:15:35,00:15:38,"I read another slightly interesting science report,"
00:15:38,00:15:42,which is that our faces look better from behind.
00:15:42,00:15:45,"So apparently, when you see someone from behind,"
00:15:45,00:15:47,you picture what their face looks like.
00:15:47,00:15:49,And you project this face onto a person.
00:15:49,00:15:51,"And ultimately, it's usually disappointing"
00:15:51,00:15:54,when the person turns around according to scientists.
00:15:54,00:15:57,And so they've said the best view for any human
00:15:57,00:15:59,is from behind of a face.
00:15:59,00:16:00,Yeah.
00:16:00,00:16:03,"Also, I found this just quite funny."
00:16:03,00:16:07,"You know, there's that whole concept of a wingman."
00:16:07,00:16:10,Frogs invented the idea of wingmaning.
00:16:10,00:16:12,"So I read this report where apparently,"
00:16:12,00:16:13,"and they did this test on, I think,"
00:16:13,00:16:16,it was 120 female frogs and a couple of guys.
00:16:16,00:16:17,And so--
00:16:17,00:16:18,A couple of guys.
00:16:18,00:16:20,"A couple of male frogs, you mean?"
00:16:20,00:16:21,"Couple of man frogs, yeah."
00:16:21,00:16:25,And so the man frogs would come into the bar.
00:16:25,00:16:29,"And one of the man frogs would bring an ugly mate,"
00:16:29,00:16:30,as the scientists call it.
00:16:30,00:16:33,"And the ugly mate would come in, and it'd make the other frog"
00:16:33,00:16:36,"look better looking, and then the other female frogs"
00:16:36,00:16:38,"would be like, oh, who's the good looking?"
00:16:38,00:16:40,"Yeah, I always take a slug to a bar."
00:16:40,00:16:43,[LAUGHTER]
00:16:43,00:16:45,It works pretty badly.
00:16:45,00:16:47,[LAUGHTER]
00:16:47,00:16:49,"Everyone who's getting off with the slug is tricky, but--"
00:16:49,00:16:53,[LAUGHTER]
00:16:53,00:16:55,We're going to have to move on.
00:16:55,00:16:57,"OK, it's time for fact number three."
00:16:57,00:16:58,And that is James Harkin.
00:16:58,00:17:02,"OK, my fact this week is that the National Giant Vegetable"
00:17:02,00:17:07,Championships had to move venue in the mid-80s as the pumpkins
00:17:07,00:17:09,started getting too big to fit through the doors.
00:17:09,00:17:11,[LAUGHTER]
00:17:11,00:17:14,"Sorry, I just find that so funny."
00:17:14,00:17:14,Let's--
00:17:14,00:17:16,Do we know how big the doors were?
00:17:16,00:17:17,"Yeah, it was a pub."
00:17:17,00:17:20,"It was called the Milk Haven, it's in Cumbran."
00:17:20,00:17:23,And so it's a proper double swinging doors.
00:17:23,00:17:26,"And in the mid-80s, yeah, they had to move it,"
00:17:26,00:17:30,"and then it moved to the Cumbran Working Men's Club, which"
00:17:30,00:17:32,presumably just had bigger doors.
00:17:32,00:17:34,"Where is Cumbran, sorry?"
00:17:34,00:17:35,It's in South Wales.
00:17:35,00:17:35,OK.
00:17:35,00:17:37,So how big were these pumpkins?
00:17:37,00:17:40,"Oh, well, I'm not sure how big they were then."
00:17:40,00:17:44,"The heaviest pumpkin in history weighed 1,054 kilograms,"
00:17:44,00:17:47,which is about the same weight as the Ford Fiesta.
00:17:47,00:17:49,But let's practical for the commuter.
00:17:49,00:17:53,[LAUGHTER]
00:17:53,00:17:57,"Just at midnight going, this hasn't changed at all."
00:17:57,00:18:00,"It was grown by Benny Meyer from Switzerland,"
00:18:00,00:18:02,"and it was according to the Guinness Book of Records,"
00:18:02,00:18:05,it was authenticated by the great pumpkin commonwealth.
00:18:05,00:18:12,I was reading today on Pumpkin.com that apparently they--
00:18:12,00:18:15,"this is new thing for Halloween now, whereby people actively"
00:18:15,00:18:16,want ugly-looking pumpkins.
00:18:16,00:18:19,And they've been trying to breed out ugly-looking pumpkins
00:18:19,00:18:21,"for a very long time, because anyone buying a pumpkin"
00:18:21,00:18:22,wants a good-looking pumpkin.
00:18:22,00:18:26,"Now a sort of warty-looking, disfigured pumpkin"
00:18:26,00:18:27,is all the rage.
00:18:27,00:18:29,And so they actually-- it's a very lucrative business
00:18:29,00:18:31,"at the moment to mess up your pumpkins,"
00:18:31,00:18:35,to make him look a bit odd from one day of the year.
00:18:35,00:18:38,The ugly-warty pumpkins are very popular
00:18:38,00:18:40,with the good-looking pumpkins who take them to bars.
00:18:40,00:18:42,[LAUGHTER]
00:18:42,00:18:44,"No, these giant pumpkins, they are amazing."
00:18:44,00:18:47,"They grow them on pallets, as in they"
00:18:47,00:18:49,"put a pallet underneath the ground while it grows,"
00:18:49,00:18:51,"so that once it's got big enough, they"
00:18:51,00:18:53,can get a four-cliff truck down and put it under the ground
00:18:53,00:18:57,"and lift it up, because otherwise it'll just burst or explode."
00:18:57,00:18:59,I read an account of a guy who managed to--
00:18:59,00:19:02,"he put a four-cliff truck fork, the roux, his pumpkin."
00:19:02,00:19:03,"Oh, my God."
00:19:03,00:19:05,As he was taking it to the competition.
00:19:05,00:19:06,"Does that-- oh, my God."
00:19:06,00:19:08,"Oh, my God."
00:19:08,00:19:10,There's a guy called Clive Bevan.
00:19:10,00:19:11,He grows giant pumpkins.
00:19:11,00:19:16,"And in 2011, he donated some to be crushed by a monster truck"
00:19:16,00:19:18,at a charity event.
00:19:18,00:19:20,And I don't think there's a better evening out
00:19:20,00:19:23,than watching a giant truck crush a giant pumpkin.
00:19:23,00:19:24,Yeah.
00:19:24,00:19:25,It's not amazing.
00:19:25,00:19:28,He's been sort of poached by the Malaysian government
00:19:28,00:19:30,to grow giant pumpkins for them.
00:19:30,00:19:32,"And the ones who grew there, they're way"
00:19:32,00:19:34,"about 20 stone, and they have to be moved by helicopter."
00:19:34,00:19:38,There was a study done about how big pumpkins can get.
00:19:38,00:19:42,And they put a lot of pumpkins in like this weird vice
00:19:42,00:19:45,"instrument, and they saw how much pressure it could get."
00:19:45,00:19:47,"And they worked out that in a perfect world,"
00:19:47,00:19:51,"you could get a pumpkin that was 20,000 pounds,"
00:19:51,00:19:53,which is the size of two elephants.
00:19:53,00:19:55,And that's what their skin could hold before it would just
00:19:55,00:19:56,give up.
00:19:56,00:19:58,"That does sound like a perfect world, James."
00:19:58,00:20:05,This is why I never won Miss World.
00:20:05,00:20:14,The longest carrot ever was 19 feet long.
00:20:14,00:20:15,Whoa.
00:20:15,00:20:17,"And the longest beetroot, 21 feet."
00:20:17,00:20:20,"Longest part of ever, 18 feet, five inches."
00:20:20,00:20:22,What they do is they grow them in pipes.
00:20:22,00:20:25,"So you get a very long pipe, and you grow it along that."
00:20:25,00:20:27,"And it's very, very hard to get them out of the soil"
00:20:27,00:20:27,without breaking them.
00:20:27,00:20:30,"And also, you don't know how well you've done,"
00:20:30,00:20:30,until you pick them.
00:20:30,00:20:33,That's the exciting thing about growing them.
00:20:33,00:20:35,[LAUGHTER]
00:20:35,00:20:37,So they're like icebergs now.
00:20:37,00:20:38,"They're just thinking, you could grow them."
00:20:38,00:20:39,So that's a lettuces.
00:20:39,00:20:40,"Oh, sorry."
00:20:40,00:20:41,Yes.
00:20:41,00:20:42,Yeah.
00:20:42,00:20:44,[APPLAUSE]
00:20:44,00:20:47,Do you know who grew those?
00:20:47,00:20:50,Because there's one man who's held the world records
00:20:50,00:20:54,"for the largest broccoli kale carrot cabbage,"
00:20:54,00:20:57,"red cabbage, celery, and beet fruit."
00:20:57,00:20:58,Whoa.
00:20:58,00:21:01,And I don't know how he holds down a day job.
00:21:01,00:21:03,"But he's called John Evans from Alaska,"
00:21:03,00:21:05,and he's broken all of those records.
00:21:05,00:21:07,"Alaska, Alaska is the place to grow giant vegetables."
00:21:07,00:21:11,"Because in the summer months, you get 20 hours of sunshine a day."
00:21:11,00:21:12,"And so they grow really large, because they"
00:21:12,00:21:14,do more photosynthesizing.
00:21:14,00:21:15,"So if you want to grow-- if you want to beat records,"
00:21:15,00:21:16,move to Alaska.
00:21:16,00:21:17,"It's amazing it started in Wales, which"
00:21:17,00:21:22,gets about half an hour of sunshine a day.
00:21:22,00:21:24,Can I turn the conversation to doors?
00:21:24,00:21:29,"So it's relevant, right?"
00:21:29,00:21:32,That's three days on doors.com.
00:21:32,00:21:36,I'm not go wasted.
00:21:36,00:21:41,"So one thing that I found out, which I found amazing,"
00:21:41,00:21:42,is that we always have the impression
00:21:42,00:21:43,that people were smaller back in the day
00:21:43,00:21:45,because of the height of doors.
00:21:45,00:21:46,"Yeah, you would go to old British pubs,"
00:21:46,00:21:48,and the doors would be quite low.
00:21:48,00:21:50,"And we thought, wow, everyone was so small back then."
00:21:50,00:21:51,That's not true.
00:21:51,00:21:53,"It's in fact, it's that it was just doors cost a lot."
00:21:53,00:21:54,It was a shrunk.
00:21:54,00:21:55,"Yeah, the doors of sunshine."
00:21:55,00:21:58,"No, doors were quite a costly material back in the day."
00:21:58,00:22:00,So why would you have a ginormous door in your house?
00:22:00,00:22:03,You would just build something quite small that you could get into.
00:22:03,00:22:03,And--
00:22:03,00:22:06,"I guess also, if it was smaller, it would be less heat-syscaping."
00:22:06,00:22:07,Yes.
00:22:07,00:22:08,So maybe a better--
00:22:08,00:22:10,The revolving door was invented by a man
00:22:10,00:22:12,who hated holding doors open for women.
00:22:12,00:22:15,[LAUGHTER]
00:22:15,00:22:16,Really?
00:22:16,00:22:19,"Yeah, he was called Fear Filer's Fun Kennel."
00:22:19,00:22:21,"But the great thing about this guy, he has a Wikipedia page."
00:22:21,00:22:24,He has loads of articles about him in all sorts of newspapers.
00:22:24,00:22:29,But in only one place can I find that he had only one arm.
00:22:29,00:22:32,And nowhere else mentions that he only had one arm.
00:22:32,00:22:32,Wow.
00:22:32,00:22:34,"You think that'd be the first thing, right?"
00:22:34,00:22:36,"Yeah, as much as it explains his aversion"
00:22:36,00:22:38,to opening doors for people.
00:22:38,00:22:41,[LAUGHTER]
00:22:41,00:22:43,"Actually, a conventional door took his other arm."
00:22:43,00:22:45,[LAUGHTER]
00:22:45,00:22:50,"There is a-- I have read a manual on taxidermy, which says,"
00:22:50,00:22:54,do not make sure the doors of your taxidermy workshop
00:22:54,00:22:56,are large enough to get out the animals that you are.
00:22:56,00:22:58,Because there was one guy who had a bad experience
00:22:58,00:23:01,"with an elephant, a genuinely stuffed an elephant,"
00:23:01,00:23:03,and then could not get it out of his workshop.
00:23:03,00:23:04,How did he get it in there?
00:23:04,00:23:06,I don't know.
00:23:06,00:23:09,I think maybe he raised it in there and killed us there.
00:23:09,00:23:14,[LAUGHTER]
00:23:14,00:23:15,Do you know that the automatic door
00:23:15,00:23:18,was invented a very long time ago?
00:23:18,00:23:21,"Like, so we think of it as probably quite a modern invention,"
00:23:21,00:23:23,and absolutely the sort of modern--
00:23:23,00:23:24,Because it's electric.
00:23:24,00:23:25,"Yeah, the electric, exactly."
00:23:25,00:23:27,The motion sensor thing where you would be.
00:23:27,00:23:27,"Yeah, exactly."
00:23:27,00:23:31,"Yeah, but there's evidence that hero/heron of Alexandria"
00:23:31,00:23:34,actually invented an automatic door using
00:23:34,00:23:37,pneumatics and using water and so on in order to get it open
00:23:37,00:23:37,and close.
00:23:37,00:23:39,He was an amazing guy.
00:23:39,00:23:40,This guy was extraordinary.
00:23:40,00:23:42,He was a guy who invented--
00:23:42,00:23:44,He invented the first vending machine.
00:23:44,00:23:45,It was a coin-operated vending machine.
00:23:45,00:23:48,He used to teach in the libraries of Alexandria.
00:23:48,00:23:49,So this is how old it is.
00:23:49,00:23:51,"And the first vending machine, you put a coin in it"
00:23:51,00:23:52,and it gave you some holy water.
00:23:52,00:23:53,How cool is that?
00:23:53,00:23:54,That's what this guy did.
00:23:54,00:23:56,He was like the Steve Jobs of his day.
00:23:56,00:23:57,"No, I wanted the Mars Bar."
00:23:57,00:24:01,[LAUGHTER]
00:24:01,00:24:03,"OK, it's time for our final fact of the show."
00:24:03,00:24:05,And that is Chazinski.
00:24:05,00:24:08,"Yes, my fact is that the beaded lacewing insect"
00:24:08,00:24:13,incapacitates its prey by farting on it.
00:24:13,00:24:14,So the beaded lacewing is lace wings
00:24:14,00:24:17,"of those little insects, which are really understudied."
00:24:17,00:24:18,"Hardly anything is known about them,"
00:24:18,00:24:20,and they have those transparent wings.
00:24:20,00:24:24,"So when it's fully grown, it just is a vegetarian, vegan."
00:24:24,00:24:28,"But as a larva, as a baby, when it's less principled,"
00:24:28,00:24:31,it is really carnivorous.
00:24:31,00:24:35,"And so these larvae go around, and they live in termite nests."
00:24:35,00:24:37,And they go around and stun termites
00:24:37,00:24:41,"with vapor-phase toxicon, which they release from their anus."
00:24:41,00:24:45,The larva raises its anus up in the air in the termite's face.
00:24:45,00:24:47,And excretes this scent.
00:24:47,00:24:50,And the termite feels OK for a little bit.
00:24:50,00:24:51,Then it becomes immobilized.
00:24:51,00:24:54,"And then within a couple of minutes, it's kind of fainted."
00:24:54,00:24:56,And then it dies after about three hours.
00:24:56,00:24:59,"And it makes it much easier to pull apart and eat,"
00:24:59,00:25:01,which is quite an impressive way of killing your victim.
00:25:01,00:25:02,"I mean, yeah."
00:25:02,00:25:03,Yeah.
00:25:03,00:25:06,"The other thing I read is that these lacewing larvae,"
00:25:06,00:25:09,are 30 times smaller than the termites that they're eating.
00:25:09,00:25:10,Wow.
00:25:10,00:25:11,Yeah.
00:25:11,00:25:15,It's a real David and Goliath situation.
00:25:15,00:25:20,I can't imagine what your Bible class was like.
00:25:20,00:25:25,"Well, and they can incapacitate six termites in one fart."
00:25:25,00:25:26,Wow.
00:25:26,00:25:27,So very efficient.
00:25:27,00:25:31,"On the flip side of using something as a weapon,"
00:25:31,00:25:35,"using your bum as a weapon, I read about a slug in Canada."
00:25:35,00:25:37,"Careful, you may be talking about a friend of mine."
00:25:37,00:25:43,"So apparently this slug, when it gets scared,"
00:25:43,00:25:45,"when it gets frightened, it's bum falls off."
00:25:45,00:25:47,[LAUGHTER]
00:25:47,00:25:51,"It's like, boom, it's like, whoa, whoa."
00:25:51,00:25:55,"Yeah, it's called the Canadian blue-gray tail dropper slug."
00:25:55,00:25:56,[LAUGHTER]
00:25:56,00:25:58,"Yeah, it's bum just falls off."
00:25:58,00:26:01,There was a study about whether a farts contain germs.
00:26:01,00:26:03,And there are a couple of scientists from Brisbane
00:26:03,00:26:04,to study this.
00:26:04,00:26:06,They asked a colleague to break wind
00:26:06,00:26:10,"over two different petri dishes, firstly fully clothed,"
00:26:10,00:26:12,and then with their pants down.
00:26:12,00:26:15,"And the second one, trousers down,"
00:26:15,00:26:18,developed a kind of bacteria that you
00:26:18,00:26:20,only find in the gut or on the skin.
00:26:20,00:26:22,And a clothing-fulded one didn't grow anything.
00:26:22,00:26:25,"So the conclusion was, don't fart naked"
00:26:25,00:26:26,near food that you're doing.
00:26:26,00:26:30,[LAUGHTER]
00:26:30,00:26:34,"You know, I've got to rethink my dinner party strategies."
00:26:34,00:26:38,"I'm really sorry about last Friday evening, guys."
00:26:38,00:26:41,"Our farts, human farts, travel at seven miles per hour"
00:26:41,00:26:43,on a good fart.
00:26:43,00:26:46,"That's about double walking speed, isn't it?"
00:26:46,00:26:48,"That's why if you've ever tried to chase a fart,"
00:26:48,00:26:53,"but a walking pace, you can't catch up with it."
00:26:53,00:26:57,"Wait, so someone's farted that way,"
00:26:57,00:26:59,and you've got after it like a gray hound.
00:26:59,00:27:02,Yeah.
00:27:02,00:27:05,"Yeah, I think those little gray hounds do."
00:27:05,00:27:07,So there was a study done that looked
00:27:07,00:27:09,about how embarrassed people are and how little
00:27:09,00:27:11,they would like to fart in public.
00:27:11,00:27:12,Given the set of circumstances.
00:27:12,00:27:15,So they were told you could either do a silent and not
00:27:15,00:27:15,smelly fart.
00:27:15,00:27:18,"And most people were like, well, I'll do that one, please."
00:27:18,00:27:20,"And they were like, the one I least want to do"
00:27:20,00:27:23,"is the really loud, really disgusting one."
00:27:23,00:27:28,But that's very different to your dinner party strategy.
00:27:28,00:27:29,I was an outlier.
00:27:29,00:27:32,They had to discount me from the study.
00:27:32,00:27:35,But people are much more reversed to making a noise
00:27:35,00:27:37,"than doing the smell, I guess, because the noise is more"
00:27:37,00:27:39,obvious than it comes from you.
00:27:39,00:27:42,But people would much rather omit what is actually much more
00:27:42,00:27:43,"unpleasant for everyone else around you, isn't it?"
00:27:43,00:27:45,Because no one minds hearing a noise.
00:27:45,00:27:46,"Well, the interesting thing about that"
00:27:46,00:27:48,is humans can't really tell where smells come from.
00:27:48,00:27:52,It's really hard because you smell in like one dimension.
00:27:52,00:27:56,But then there are animals that can smell in stereo like moles.
00:27:56,00:27:59,"And so if you had a mole sat there next to you, Anna,"
00:27:59,00:28:02,it would know exactly where the smell came from.
00:28:02,00:28:03,But it couldn't tell anyone.
00:28:03,00:28:04,That's the tragedy of the mole.
00:28:07,00:28:11,So fats are caused by oligosaccharides
00:28:11,00:28:12,"that are little molecules, and they're"
00:28:12,00:28:15,eaten by bacteria in your gut.
00:28:15,00:28:18,"And the bacteria then make tiny little fats, which turn"
00:28:18,00:28:19,into human fats.
00:28:19,00:28:22,"So actually, a human fat is thousands"
00:28:22,00:28:24,of little tiny bacterial fats.
00:28:24,00:28:26,That's honestly the best fact I've ever heard in my life.
00:28:26,00:28:28,Are you kidding me?
00:28:28,00:28:30,We have a collection of life farting on us
00:28:30,00:28:33,that we just release it as one big wharf.
00:28:33,00:28:34,You got it.
00:28:34,00:28:36,So it kind of technically means it's never really your fold.
00:28:37,00:28:38,Exactly.
00:28:38,00:28:42,You can always blame it on someone else.
00:28:42,00:28:44,The 1956 Grand National is quite famous.
00:28:44,00:28:46,There's a horse called Devon Locke.
00:28:46,00:28:48,"And just as it was coming down the final straight,"
00:28:48,00:28:51,"it was miles ahead, and it just collapsed on the floor."
00:28:51,00:28:55,"But actually, according to the headlad of the stable,"
00:28:55,00:28:58,"he tightened the girth, which is like the strapping"
00:28:58,00:29:02,of the around the belly of the horse just before the off.
00:29:02,00:29:05,He tightened it with one more notch
00:29:05,00:29:07,and then another one for good luck.
00:29:07,00:29:09,"But also, the owner of the horse had already"
00:29:09,00:29:11,done exactly the same thing.
00:29:11,00:29:15,And one theory is that the horse that was miles in the lead
00:29:15,00:29:19,"collapsed because it farted and massive, massive fart,"
00:29:19,00:29:20,and then collapsed.
00:29:20,00:29:24,Imagine someone doing your belt loops up four notches
00:29:24,00:29:26,tighter than you used to.
00:29:26,00:29:29,"Like, I'm almost breaking wind even thinking about that"
00:29:29,00:29:30,happening.
00:29:30,00:29:35,"OK, that's it."
00:29:35,00:29:36,That's all of our facts.
