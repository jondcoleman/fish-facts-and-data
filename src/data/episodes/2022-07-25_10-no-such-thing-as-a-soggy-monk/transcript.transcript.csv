00:00:00,00:00:01,We run it on QI a few years ago.
00:00:01,00:00:02,Yeah.
00:00:02,00:00:04,"Um, which was, there's no such thing as a fish."
00:00:04,00:00:05,It ended up not such thing as a fish.
00:00:05,00:00:09,"No, seriously, it's ended up the Oxford Dictionary of Underwater Life."
00:00:09,00:00:11,"It says it right there, first paragraph."
00:00:11,00:00:12,No such thing as a fish.
00:00:12,00:00:29,"Hello, and welcome to another episode of ""No Such Thing"""
00:00:29,00:00:33,as a fish coming to you from the QI offices in Covert Garden.
00:00:33,00:00:34,My name is Dan Treiber.
00:00:34,00:00:39,"I'm sitting here with three other QI elves, James Harkin, Andy Murray,"
00:00:39,00:00:41,"and on fact-checking Judy's this week, Ann Miller."
00:00:41,00:00:44,"And once again, we're going to go over our favorite facts"
00:00:44,00:00:45,from the last seven days.
00:00:45,00:00:48,"Joining us today, we have a special guest, a comedian"
00:00:48,00:00:50,"and friend of ours, Eric Lamper."
00:00:50,00:00:51,"Hello, how are you doing, mate?"
00:00:51,00:00:52,"I'm very good, thanks."
00:00:52,00:00:54,Eric is a good friend of ours.
00:00:54,00:00:55,He's a comedian.
00:00:55,00:00:59,"He recently, as a stand-up, opened for Eddie Isard."
00:00:59,00:01:01,"In French, it was a French gig."
00:01:01,00:01:03,And Eric did his set in French entirely.
00:01:03,00:01:05,He's also going to star in an upcoming movie
00:01:05,00:01:07,called Amstar Dam.
00:01:07,00:01:08,"Yeah, that's true."
00:01:08,00:01:10,"Yeah, I think it'll be here, I think."
00:01:10,00:01:11,"Oh, what's it about?"
00:01:11,00:01:12,So it's not bad.
00:01:12,00:01:14,It's like a fairy tale world.
00:01:14,00:01:16,It is a stoner film with that name.
00:01:16,00:01:18,"Yeah, I'm quite excited, you know."
00:01:18,00:01:20,Based in Neverlands.
00:01:20,00:01:21,"Yeah, so it's in Amsterdam, yeah."
00:01:21,00:01:24,And I can't really reveal too much.
00:01:24,00:01:27,I have a fact about Amsterdam to hear it.
00:01:27,00:01:29,"I can't remember what year it was, it was about, I don't know,"
00:01:29,00:01:30,80 years or so ago.
00:01:30,00:01:33,But there was a fog so bad that 29 people
00:01:33,00:01:38,fell into the canals in a single night.
00:01:38,00:01:39,That's fantastic.
00:01:39,00:01:41,"OK, let's start with fact number one."
00:01:41,00:01:43,"And we're going to start with our special guest, Eric."
00:01:43,00:01:46,[NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]
00:01:46,00:01:50,"In 1923, Jockey Frank Hayes won a race in Belmont Park"
00:01:50,00:01:53,"in New York, despite being dead."
00:01:53,00:01:54,Wow.
00:01:54,00:01:55,"OK, so explain that one."
00:01:55,00:01:55,Yeah.
00:01:55,00:01:57,"No, he started alive, right?"
00:01:57,00:01:58,He started alive.
00:01:58,00:01:59,Oh.
00:01:59,00:02:01,So he died mid-race?
00:02:01,00:02:02,"Mid-race, yeah."
00:02:02,00:02:04,"OK, give us more of the story."
00:02:04,00:02:07,"Well, basically, he suffered from a heart attack mid-race."
00:02:07,00:02:10,But he was straddled nice and strong in the saddle.
00:02:10,00:02:12,And the horse won.
00:02:12,00:02:15,But how does-- is there a seat belt?
00:02:15,00:02:16,"Maybe he killed over, right?"
00:02:16,00:02:19,"Yeah, but you're not going to move his chains, sort of like,"
00:02:19,00:02:20,"slammed over, can I think."
00:02:20,00:02:23,So he's got his feet nice and strapped in.
00:02:23,00:02:26,"And you've got your hands, as well, sort of tied around the--"
00:02:26,00:02:27,the reins.
00:02:27,00:02:28,"Oh, yeah."
00:02:28,00:02:31,Did anyone notice during the race?
00:02:31,00:02:33,It was the only discovered after he had won.
00:02:33,00:02:35,He was probably the only one who was just kept running
00:02:35,00:02:37,more and more laps.
00:02:37,00:02:40,He's probably the only one not hitting the horse.
00:02:40,00:02:41,"Yeah, yes, still won."
00:02:41,00:02:43,What does that say about cruelty?
00:02:43,00:02:45,"Yeah, listen, this horse-- am I right in saying"
00:02:45,00:02:46,it was called sweet kiss?
00:02:46,00:02:48,"Sweet, sweet kiss of death."
00:02:48,00:02:49,Sweet kiss of death.
00:02:49,00:02:50,That's what they nicknamed it afterwards.
00:02:50,00:02:51,Is it?
00:02:51,00:02:51,Yeah.
00:02:51,00:02:52,Wow.
00:02:52,00:02:54,This is an interesting link.
00:02:54,00:02:56,"Your dad, Eric, is a jockie, isn't he?"
00:02:56,00:02:58,"Yeah, I mean, that's one of the reasons why I thought."
00:02:58,00:03:01,"I mean, I only found out this fact this week."
00:03:01,00:03:03,"But yeah, my dad is indeed a jockie."
00:03:03,00:03:06,"Because you're pretty tall, if you don't mind me saying."
00:03:06,00:03:12,"Yeah, and I've got big gums as well, which has never helped."
00:03:12,00:03:14,"As school they'd be like, oh, clearly your dad's"
00:03:14,00:03:15,had sex with a horse.
00:03:15,00:03:18,It's all fair.
00:03:18,00:03:19,"Unfortunately, I'm hung like a human."
00:03:20,00:03:23,[LAUGHTER]
00:03:23,00:03:25,You know the way that jockie's sit.
00:03:25,00:03:28,It's kind of like a crouched thing where they're leaning forward.
00:03:28,00:03:30,"Not the dead ones, the alive ones."
00:03:30,00:03:32,This is called the monkey crouch.
00:03:32,00:03:36,And it was invented by a guy called Todd Sloan in 1897.
00:03:36,00:03:38,And what's interesting about it is no one
00:03:38,00:03:40,rode horses like that before in horse races.
00:03:40,00:03:43,"And when he invented that, horse race times and records"
00:03:43,00:03:46,improved by 5% to 7% in a single year.
00:03:46,00:03:48,So he just completely changed the spot
00:03:48,00:03:50,by deciding to crouch down on lean forward.
00:03:50,00:03:51,No one had ever done it before.
00:03:51,00:03:52,"Wow, that's amazing."
00:03:52,00:03:54,"That's like the, um, in the foes."
00:03:54,00:03:55,"Yeah, in high jump."
00:03:55,00:03:56,Yes.
00:03:56,00:03:59,"I mean, that completely transformed the sport, didn't it?"
00:03:59,00:04:02,"We did a couple of years ago, the new way of throwing a javelin,"
00:04:02,00:04:05,"which was invented very briefly in the 1930s,"
00:04:05,00:04:08,"which is to hold it by one end, swing around, and let go."
00:04:08,00:04:09,The javelin.
00:04:09,00:04:10,"Yeah, like throwing the hammer."
00:04:10,00:04:15,And it was banned almost immediately for obvious reasons.
00:04:15,00:04:18,But it did provide amazingly long javelin throws.
00:04:18,00:04:20,"In fact, to the extent that it could have been quite dangerous,"
00:04:20,00:04:23,"A, because it goes too far and might have spectators,"
00:04:23,00:04:27,"and B, because it's very hard to get it in exactly the right direction."
00:04:27,00:04:30,It's getting paled to say it's incredible.
00:04:30,00:04:37,"A slight margin of error in the Paris Olympics in 1904, 1900."
00:04:37,00:04:38,"Paris 1900, yeah."
00:04:38,00:04:39,Paris 1900.
00:04:39,00:04:42,"People trained in the public parks, javelins."
00:04:42,00:04:45,And they had to be warm to be extra vigilant.
00:04:45,00:04:49,"Some people trained at night, so there was less chance of hitting people."
00:04:49,00:04:52,But also more chance of hitting people.
00:04:52,00:04:56,The interesting thing about javelins is that they make them lesser or dynamic
00:04:56,00:05:00,"as the time goes on, because the length of a running track"
00:05:00,00:05:02,is always going to be about 100 meters.
00:05:02,00:05:05,And so what they do is they have to make sure the javelin can't be thrown more
00:05:05,00:05:06,than that.
00:05:06,00:05:09,"People get stronger and stronger and better, and they get closer to 100 meters."
00:05:09,00:05:13,And then they always make the javelins a little bit worse so that people can't get that far.
00:05:13,00:05:20,"By the end, it'll just be like a toothpick, not really a heavy toothpick."
00:05:20,00:05:22,"Wow, OK, so what were you always out with at the--"
00:05:22,00:05:26,I was 18 and 97 when he discovered that idea.
00:05:26,00:05:28,"OK, that's amazing."
00:05:28,00:05:33,It's an interesting thing when you start looking into what people have achieved once they've
00:05:33,00:05:34,died.
00:05:34,00:05:38,There's a really one of my favorite stories from the Gnobel's world.
00:05:38,00:05:41,"We've had Mark Abrams, the founder, on a few podcasts ago."
00:05:41,00:05:46,"And he wrote a book years ago called The Gnobel Prizes 2, Why Chickens Prefer Beautiful Humans."
00:05:46,00:05:52,"There's a fantastic story about a man called Laal Bahari, who in 1975, when he went to the bank"
00:05:52,00:05:58,"to apply for a loan, he discovered that he'd been declared dead by his uncle, who wanted"
00:05:58,00:06:02,to declare him dead in order to get the land rights for the farm that he owned.
00:06:02,00:06:09,And he spent 19 years as a dead man trying to get recognized as a living man.
00:06:09,00:06:10,And it just no one would recognize him.
00:06:10,00:06:14,And he did incredible things like he stood for parliaments.
00:06:14,00:06:18,"He tried to get arrested countless times because they arrested him technically, it meant"
00:06:18,00:06:19,he was alive.
00:06:19,00:06:20,So they couldn't arrest him.
00:06:20,00:06:21,He would do all this stuff.
00:06:21,00:06:23,"And they're like, we can't arrest you because you're dead."
00:06:23,00:06:29,"And so for 19 years, he stayed dead technically and he finally got a court to overturn it."
00:06:29,00:06:32,And he set up in his town where he lived.
00:06:32,00:06:38,"And I think for all of India, which is where he's from, a whole network and a group in support"
00:06:38,00:06:41,"of people who have been declared dead, who are in fact alive."
00:06:41,00:06:43,"Oh, I'd love to have that power."
00:06:43,00:06:45,That's so amazing.
00:06:45,00:06:49,It's called the Association of Dead People that he created.
00:06:49,00:06:52,And it was in 1994 that he was finally proven to be alive.
00:06:52,00:06:56,"It's a massive problem as well, in places where the paperwork often doesn't catch up with"
00:06:56,00:07:00,"people's actual legal status or whether or alive or not, that it happens a great deal."
00:07:00,00:07:02,"It's why there's a need for an association, you know?"
00:07:02,00:07:03,Was that in India?
00:07:03,00:07:04,"Yes, it was."
00:07:04,00:07:07,"Well, I do believe in reincarnation, that's why he was born again."
00:07:07,00:07:08,That's possible.
00:07:08,00:07:13,"Well, let's go back to horse racing and jockey and stuff like that."
00:07:13,00:07:20,"And there was a jockey, a very successful one called Lafitte, Pinque, Jr. And in order to"
00:07:20,00:07:25,"keep his weight down, he would take a single peanut, slice it into slivers and eat just half"
00:07:25,00:07:26,of it for lunch.
00:07:26,00:07:29,The dieting for a jockey is actually mad.
00:07:29,00:07:34,"So like me and my mum and my mum's French, so we'd eat like so much, we'd probably pick"
00:07:34,00:07:35,out.
00:07:35,00:07:38,But he'd always eat salads and stuff.
00:07:38,00:07:44,And then I remember when we were in South Africa for one of his races and he carved himself
00:07:44,00:07:46,"in black bin bags, right?"
00:07:46,00:07:49,And just sell it taped all the way up to his neck.
00:07:49,00:07:54,And then he pushed a wheelbarrow full of things and he ran around with the wheelbarrow around
00:07:54,00:07:55,the field to lose the weight.
00:07:55,00:08:01,And then I remember he took off all the black bin bags and it just pulled out like a waterfall.
00:08:01,00:08:02,It was disgusting.
00:08:02,00:08:03,That's amazing.
00:08:03,00:08:07,"I also read the people's speed walk, a jockey speed walk instead of run because they don't"
00:08:07,00:08:09,"want to put an extra muscle, don't know if that's good."
00:08:09,00:08:10,Muscle weight.
00:08:10,00:08:11,"Muscle weight, yeah."
00:08:11,00:08:12,Muscle weight.
00:08:12,00:08:13,"Muscle weight, yeah."
00:08:13,00:08:14,Is it AP McCoy?
00:08:14,00:08:15,Yeah.
00:08:15,00:08:16,He's one of the great jockeys of time.
00:08:16,00:08:17,"Yeah, I lived near him."
00:08:17,00:08:18,Do you?
00:08:18,00:08:19,"New market, yeah."
00:08:19,00:08:23,"He has very intensive, almost-golding-hot baths."
00:08:23,00:08:26,"Same reason I think, to sweat out so much of the water in his body."
00:08:26,00:08:29,"He does it for a couple of hours, a couple of times a day before a race."
00:08:29,00:08:30,Yeah.
00:08:30,00:08:35,"Like sometimes I'll commit a crime leader, police, just to see if they get away with it."
00:08:35,00:08:37,That's like two stones gone.
00:08:37,00:08:41,"Okay, before we move on, Anne, have you got any facts you want to-"
00:08:41,00:08:42,"Yeah, I do."
00:08:42,00:08:44,James's Amsterdam fog was in 1893.
00:08:44,00:08:48,It was 79 people who fell into the canals that one night.
00:08:48,00:08:51,So what's where you're going in fog?
00:08:51,00:08:56,"Frank Hayes, the New York Times, reckoned that he died just after his horse took lead"
00:08:56,00:08:58,before he finished.
00:08:58,00:09:05,"And they put it down to his heavy training regime, and his excitement coming first, which so-"
00:09:05,00:09:07,"Well, the horse is excitement."
00:09:07,00:09:08,Frank Hayes' excitement.
00:09:08,00:09:09,"Oh, okay."
00:09:09,00:09:12,"Have he been working so hard, and then he suddenly saw he was about to win, and that made"
00:09:12,00:09:13,a big deal.
00:09:13,00:09:14,"Well, it gave way."
00:09:14,00:09:18,"There is a tumbler I found called Curious History, I haven't seen them before, but they"
00:09:18,00:09:22,"are probably one of the 20 best tumblers in the world, according to MSN, and they say"
00:09:22,00:09:27,"their spectators thought he was showing off and was riding one-handed, kind of like riding"
00:09:27,00:09:28,a bike with no hands.
00:09:28,00:09:33,"See, it's going over the line, and then when he realized he died till the race was over,"
00:09:33,00:09:37,"which the javelin spinning round technique, actually quite effective, the current world"
00:09:37,00:09:46,"record was 83 meters, and the guy who spun around threw 112, but was then disallowed, because"
00:09:46,00:09:49,"yeah, didn't want the copycats, that was in 1966."
00:09:49,00:09:52,So the world record for javelin has been disqualified at the time?
00:09:52,00:09:55,"Well, that one was because he did not want the world over your head."
00:09:55,00:10:04,"I don't think anyone's got that far, but the thing is every time they change the javelin,"
00:10:04,00:10:08,"that invalidates all previous records, because you're not on a level playing field."
00:10:08,00:10:13,"Yeah, the current record is with the current javelin is 98.48 meters, so still less than the"
00:10:13,00:10:14,guy who spun over his head.
00:10:14,00:10:15,That's amazing.
00:10:15,00:10:16,"So yeah, it's pretty good."
00:10:16,00:10:17,Good.
00:10:17,00:10:18,Factional Nuggets.
00:10:18,00:10:28,"Okay, let's move on to fact number two."
00:10:28,00:10:33,"Fact number two is my fact, and that is that some Buddhist monks run marathons to achieve"
00:10:33,00:10:35,enlightenment.
00:10:35,00:10:42,"So this is a, I think, extraordinary endurance test."
00:10:42,00:10:46,"Kind of seems like it's the greatest endurance test on our planet, which is done by these"
00:10:46,00:10:51,"monks who are known as the marathon monks, and these marathon monks achieve enlightenment"
00:10:51,00:10:57,by going on these huge thousand day running challenges that go over the course of seven
00:10:57,00:11:05,"years, and each year they have to do 100 days in one chunk of running a distance per day."
00:11:05,00:11:10,"So 30 kilometers for the first 100 days, then they take a break, then they do another 100"
00:11:10,00:11:14,"days next year and year two, they do 30 kilometers again per day."
00:11:14,00:11:19,"Number three, it's 30 kilometers again, and it's 30 for four, and then for five they do 200"
00:11:19,00:11:20,day straight.
00:11:20,00:11:25,"On year six it jumps up to 60 kilometers per day for 100 day straight, and then in year"
00:11:25,00:11:31,"seven it's 84 kilometers per day for 100 day straight, and then 30 kilometers additional"
00:11:31,00:11:33,100 days after that.
00:11:33,00:11:38,And if at any point during this whole process they fail to reach the number that they're
00:11:38,00:11:42,"meant to reach on that target, they kill themselves."
00:11:42,00:11:47,And only 46 people in the hundred years or so that this has been going on had successfully
00:11:47,00:11:48,completed it.
00:11:48,00:11:51,So they kill themselves if they haven't already died in the meantime.
00:11:51,00:11:52,Exactly.
00:11:52,00:11:56,"But if they sort of if they run short by a couple of kilometers, they carry, they dress"
00:11:56,00:12:00,in white because the white is the symbol of the color of death.
00:12:00,00:12:01,So they're dressed for death.
00:12:01,00:12:04,They bring a sword and a rope.
00:12:04,00:12:05,So they can either.
00:12:05,00:12:06,Sounds a lot.
00:12:06,00:12:07,A couple of camera.
00:12:07,00:12:11,Are you sure you've got your packs right?
00:12:11,00:12:16,"Yeah, so they have the option of hanging themselves or of stabbing themselves."
00:12:16,00:12:19,I think they may not still kill themselves.
00:12:19,00:12:23,"I think they haven't since the since the 19th century, I think it's been officially a bit"
00:12:23,00:12:24,discouraged.
00:12:24,00:12:25,"Yeah, yeah, it's been."
00:12:25,00:12:26,That's true.
00:12:26,00:12:27,The original hard.
00:12:27,00:12:33,"I mean, there is an area near the mountain where these monks live in Japan, which is called"
00:12:33,00:12:34,the mountain high.
00:12:34,00:12:38,"I don't know how to pronounce that properly, it's H-I-E-I, and it's littered with unmarked"
00:12:38,00:12:44,graves from the people pre-19th century monks who did not manage to finish and complete
00:12:44,00:12:46,it and had to kill themselves as a result.
00:12:46,00:12:50,"But the idea is that if you do complete it, you get a medal."
00:12:50,00:12:54,"You get a nice little medal, you get to get it back and those flowers and they still will"
00:12:54,00:12:57,blanket around you for when you finish it.
00:12:57,00:13:01,"Well, actually, you say silver blanket, but one thing that I found out about monks is"
00:13:01,00:13:08,that they have a technique where they can heat themselves up.
00:13:08,00:13:13,"So it's a yoga technique called tummo, and they can enter like a deep meditation, and"
00:13:13,00:13:21,"if there's a few monks around each other, and they can have like cold blankets on them,"
00:13:21,00:13:24,and they can heat those blankets in a cold room.
00:13:24,00:13:25,Wow.
00:13:25,00:13:26,And other people would die.
00:13:26,00:13:31,"There have been experiments on those guys who had wet blankets put on them, and they"
00:13:31,00:13:35,started steaming until they were completely dry.
00:13:35,00:13:40,"There isn't an endurance swimmer who we've covered on QI on TV, and he is able to raise"
00:13:40,00:13:45,"his body temperature by up to one or two degrees, because he swims in very icy water."
00:13:45,00:13:49,"And I wrote to him and asked, is this true, and one of his representatives wrote back and"
00:13:49,00:13:51,"said, ""Yep, that's what he does."""
00:13:51,00:13:54,Let's go back to crazy monks.
00:13:54,00:13:55,"Yes, yeah."
00:13:55,00:13:56,Let's do that.
00:13:56,00:13:59,"I'll tell you one more thing about the marathon monks just to bring us back in, which is"
00:13:59,00:14:05,that so 46 people only have ever completed this course.
00:14:05,00:14:09,"I think I've got the number wrong, and it would be great to know when this practice started,"
00:14:09,00:14:14,"because I think it's either 100 years ago, 400 years ago, or 1000 years ago."
00:14:14,00:14:19,But 46 people have completed it.
00:14:19,00:14:20,One guy did it twice.
00:14:20,00:14:21,Yeah.
00:14:21,00:14:24,He's super enlightened.
00:14:24,00:14:25,Yeah.
00:14:25,00:14:27,How many marathons has Eddie is up there?
00:14:27,00:14:28,"Yeah, quite a lot."
00:14:28,00:14:30,"No, did he do six days?"
00:14:30,00:14:35,"Yeah, Eddie did 43 marathons in 51 days in 2009."
00:14:35,00:14:40,"Also, his marathons were presumably a lot shorter, I'm guessing."
00:14:40,00:14:43,"No, I marathon is always the same distance, no?"
00:14:43,00:14:45,"Although, they're not always the same distance."
00:14:45,00:14:51,"The original distance run after the Battle of Marathon was, I think, about 22 miles."
00:14:51,00:14:54,"It wasn't any more than 25, either."
00:14:54,00:14:55,And there was a lot of early flux.
00:14:55,00:15:02,"But wasn't the first marathon by this guy that had to run from Argos to, like, somewhere else,"
00:15:02,00:15:04,because he was reporting on a battle.
00:15:04,00:15:05,"Oh, OK, the battle I was."
00:15:05,00:15:06,There had been one.
00:15:06,00:15:07,It wasn't that we've lost the battle.
00:15:07,00:15:09,"You need to flee immediately, I was, hey, we won, guys."
00:15:09,00:15:12,"OK, right, so it was the Battle of Marathon."
00:15:12,00:15:13,That's it.
00:15:13,00:15:15,"It wasn't actually called that one marathon, yeah."
00:15:15,00:15:16,"Yeah, it was that one."
00:15:16,00:15:20,"There is a really interesting thing about the official modern marathon length,"
00:15:20,00:15:24,which is that it's 26 miles and 385 yards.
00:15:24,00:15:28,"And it was only, it's only been the case since 1908."
00:15:28,00:15:30,And it was done to please the British royal family.
00:15:30,00:15:34,"Because Queen Alexandra wanted the race to start on the lawn at Windsor Castle,"
00:15:34,00:15:37,so that her children could watch from the nursery window.
00:15:37,00:15:39,And then an extra mile was added to the race.
00:15:39,00:15:42,"And then, at the end of the race, 385 yards were added, so that it could finish"
00:15:42,00:15:46,in front of the royal box at the Olympic Stadium in White City.
00:15:46,00:15:51,So it's all been done an extra mile and 385 yards.
00:15:51,00:15:53,At the Royal Wim.
00:15:53,00:15:55,Here's the thing about crazy marathon.
00:15:55,00:15:58,So as a Italian athlete called Maro Prosperi.
00:15:58,00:16:03,"And in 1994, he was running a marathon in the Moroccan Sahara."
00:16:03,00:16:04,But he got lost.
00:16:04,00:16:11,"And when they found him nine days later, he'd run 200 kilometers off course into Algeria."
00:16:11,00:16:15,He'd lost 18 kilograms and only survived by drinking his own urine
00:16:15,00:16:19,and eating bats that he found in an abandoned mosque.
00:16:19,00:16:21,Wow.
00:16:21,00:16:25,"But this guy, he had to catch these bats."
00:16:25,00:16:26,That's pretty impressive as well.
00:16:26,00:16:30,"If he, after running, lose his weight, drinking your own urine,"
00:16:30,00:16:34,"still out of the car, now I'm going to catch these bats."
00:16:34,00:16:35,Wow.
00:16:35,00:16:37,And he just must have thought he was having a terrible race.
00:16:37,00:16:39,"But he was, he might have thought he was winning."
00:16:39,00:16:40,"Yeah, he's done."
00:16:40,00:16:42,The other guy's up in here any minute.
00:16:42,00:16:46,"So anyway, he got a bit dispirited as you would after a few days."
00:16:46,00:16:50,And he wrote a note to his wife and he took a pen knife from his rucksack.
00:16:50,00:16:53,And he rucksack and he slits his wrists.
00:16:53,00:16:59,"But he was so dehydrated that his blood, his blood thickened so much,"
00:16:59,00:17:02,it clotted the wound so he couldn't even kill himself.
00:17:02,00:17:03,And then they eventually found him.
00:17:03,00:17:06,"Well, you should have had as a rope or some sword."
00:17:06,00:17:07,Some sort.
00:17:07,00:17:10,It's a bit of sword.
00:17:10,00:17:14,"I really like the story of when the modern Olympics came back,"
00:17:14,00:17:17,the very first marathon that was run.
00:17:17,00:17:19,"Because it was a big, it was a big, it was the, I guess,"
00:17:19,00:17:21,big event for Greece.
00:17:21,00:17:23,The idea that that is what they would win.
00:17:23,00:17:26,"The marathon, the marathon was so rooted in their culture."
00:17:26,00:17:29,And they already had been disappointed because they lost discus.
00:17:29,00:17:32,They were furious because that should have been one of the events that they wanted.
00:17:32,00:17:34,I have a quick thing about that.
00:17:34,00:17:40,The guy who won the discus had never competed with one of their discuses before.
00:17:40,00:17:41,He was an American.
00:17:41,00:17:46,"And he had had to practice what made in America, which was extremely heavy."
00:17:46,00:17:50,"And so he got to the real Olympics, completely fluffed his first two goals,"
00:17:50,00:17:53,because he wasn't used to playing with this new discus.
00:17:53,00:17:55,And then through the winning shows.
00:17:55,00:17:57,"By the way, you're throwing it like a frisbee as well."
00:17:57,00:18:01,"Well, that might be what is the sport move."
00:18:01,00:18:02,The monkey crouch.
00:18:02,00:18:03,Yeah.
00:18:03,00:18:05,"Sorry, you were saying about the marathon."
00:18:05,00:18:08,"No, so they've been sort of shamed in the discus."
00:18:08,00:18:10,They lost it to that man.
00:18:10,00:18:12,And so they desperately needed the win in the marathon.
00:18:12,00:18:16,So there were 17 people competing in the marathon.
00:18:16,00:18:20,And they had good chances of winning as 13 of those athletes were from Greece.
00:18:20,00:18:23,So that was pretty high odds.
00:18:23,00:18:24,"But it's great, because very early audit the race."
00:18:24,00:18:25,So it kind of shows you.
00:18:25,00:18:29,"It shows you a different age of sportsmen as well when you hear these stories of how more,"
00:18:29,00:18:31,kind of like they had the right stuff.
00:18:31,00:18:32,And there was more grit.
00:18:32,00:18:36,So the early leader in the race was actually a Frenchman runner.
00:18:36,00:18:40,"But he ended up pulling out of the race, because he got to exhaust."
00:18:40,00:18:44,"But mid race, while he was in the lead, he made a stop at a local inn"
00:18:44,00:18:47,to drink a glass of cognac from his future father-in-law.
00:18:47,00:18:51,So he had time to stop and have two drinks and then carry on.
00:18:51,00:18:53,But then he dropped out because of exhaustion.
00:18:53,00:18:56,So the guy who ended up winning was from Greece.
00:18:56,00:18:58,His name was Spirited and Louise.
00:18:58,00:19:00,He ran it in two hours and 58 minutes.
00:19:00,00:19:05,"And what fueled him along the way, what his kind of choice of drinks, where he had wine,"
00:19:05,00:19:09,"milk, beer, some orange juice, and an Easter egg."
00:19:09,00:19:10,Brilliant.
00:19:10,00:19:13,"Yeah, that's the winner of the first ever modern Olympic marathon."
00:19:13,00:19:14,A Easter egg.
00:19:14,00:19:15,An Easter egg.
00:19:15,00:19:18,"About the guy going into a pub, they used to do that in the Tour de France."
00:19:18,00:19:23,"You know, that lake, whatever the tour would go by a pub or a bar."
00:19:23,00:19:28,The cyclists would just all get out and on mass run into the bar and just pilfer everything
00:19:28,00:19:32,they could get on the wine and all the beers and everything like that.
00:19:32,00:19:33,And they would run out again and then go.
00:19:33,00:19:38,"So all the people who ran bars and that went past the Tour de France thing, they would"
00:19:38,00:19:41,always close down the shutters and try and stop the cyclists from getting in.
00:19:41,00:19:43,"It's always the French, isn't it?"
00:19:43,00:19:48,"Eric, as your dad, I've stopped halfway through a race for a glass of orange juice slash wine."
00:19:48,00:19:52,"Well, my dad's English, so no, but he stayed for a nice roast dinner."
00:19:52,00:19:55,I love it as well.
00:19:55,00:20:00,"The second and third place were won by Greece as well, but the third place winner got to qualify"
00:20:00,00:20:04,because he was later found to have covered part of the course in a carriage.
00:20:04,00:20:05,In a carriage got a lift.
00:20:05,00:20:06,No one said it was against the rules.
00:20:06,00:20:07,That's all I'm saying.
00:20:07,00:20:08,I think we should move on.
00:20:08,00:20:09,"Yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:20:09,00:20:14,"Before we do, Anne, have you got anything for us?"
00:20:14,00:20:15,"Oh, I have got so much for you."
00:20:15,00:20:16,"Oh, great."
00:20:16,00:20:22,"So the man, the swimmer who can change his own body temperature is called Lewis Pue, PUGH,"
00:20:22,00:20:25,"so that's Pue, let's run with you."
00:20:25,00:20:29,"And he is the only person who has swam long distance in every ocean in the world, including"
00:20:29,00:20:33,"the North Pole, which he did wearing goggles, speedos and a cap."
00:20:33,00:20:34,Wow.
00:20:34,00:20:35,That was all.
00:20:35,00:20:39,"And CNN, CNN, I've called him the human polar bear, so that's him."
00:20:39,00:20:44,"But the marathon running mugs, they seem to be keeping records since 1885, makes it 129"
00:20:44,00:20:47,"years, 46 of them have done it since then."
00:20:47,00:20:48,Okay.
00:20:48,00:20:49,Eating bats is not good for you.
00:20:49,00:20:50,They spread diseases.
00:20:50,00:20:53,"Guinea, actually a few weeks ago, have banned eating bats because they've got an Ebola"
00:20:53,00:20:58,"breakout and they're learning the bats for their 62 people, 62 people have died and they"
00:20:58,00:21:02,eat them either in a peppery soup or they drive them out before a fire.
00:21:02,00:21:06,They advise not eating bats until the Ebola has gone away.
00:21:06,00:21:10,"In terms of eating strange things while you run, it's not quite Easter eggs, but a same"
00:21:10,00:21:13,bolt famously loves his chicken nuggets.
00:21:13,00:21:16,"When he, on the day he won a gold medal in Beijing, they asked him how he did it and he said"
00:21:16,00:21:20,"he basically got up late, eight chicken nuggets went back to bed, eight more chicken nuggets"
00:21:20,00:21:21,did the race.
00:21:21,00:21:22,Such a show off.
00:21:22,00:21:23,Such a show off.
00:21:23,00:21:24,Got a world record.
00:21:24,00:21:27,"Apparently you got through a thousand chicken nuggets over the Beijing Olympics, which"
00:21:27,00:21:30,worked out 100 a day.
00:21:30,00:21:34,"That's a marathon, that's like a marathon monk, but that's the equivalent of two actual"
00:21:34,00:21:37,"chickens, which is pretty impressive."
00:21:37,00:21:38,That has not been factored.
00:21:38,00:21:49,"If you're listening to the man, that's for you."
00:21:49,00:21:54,"Okay, on to fact number three and that is yours, James."
00:21:54,00:21:59,"Okay, my fact this week is the Slovakian and Slovenian embassies in Washington meet once"
00:21:59,00:22:04,a month to exchange wrongly-addressed mail.
00:22:04,00:22:05,That's fantastic.
00:22:05,00:22:06,Isn't that great?
00:22:06,00:22:13,"I just, this came from a website, SlovakRepublic.org, I think it seems to be pretty kosher."
00:22:13,00:22:19,"This Slovak website, I've got a special section of the website saying, ""We are not Slovenia."""
00:22:19,00:22:23,They've got a load of examples.
00:22:23,00:22:28,"Apparently, George W. Bush once said, ""The only thing I know about Slovakia is what"
00:22:28,00:22:33,"I learned first-hand from your foreign minister who came to Texas, and their foreign minister"
00:22:33,00:22:34,had never been to Texas.
00:22:34,00:22:37,"It was the Slovenian foreign minister who'd been there before."""
00:22:37,00:22:38,Oh really?
00:22:38,00:22:39,"It's difficult, George W."
00:22:39,00:22:45,"It's not just him, Silvio Berlusconi introduced Slovenian Prime Minister Anton Rupp to the"
00:22:45,00:22:51,"crowd of journalists saying, ""I'm very happy to be here today with the Prime Minister"
00:22:51,00:22:52,"of Slovakia."""
00:22:52,00:22:55,It's very easily done.
00:22:55,00:23:00,It does happen for these countries that we find that we keep seeing examples of people
00:23:00,00:23:08,"putting a minimum effort into actually working out who they are, remember that famous incident"
00:23:08,00:23:14,"with the National Anthem for Kazakhstan, up on the podium, this girl with one gold medal,"
00:23:14,00:23:17,and then they play the Borat version.
00:23:17,00:23:26,"The lyrics are in, ""The lyrics are like we have the cleanest prostitutes in the region."""
00:23:26,00:23:31,"Kazakhstan's prostitutes are the cleanest in the region, except, of course, for Turkmenistan."
00:23:31,00:23:35,"Kazakhstan, Kazakhstan, you varied eyes place, come grasp the mighty penis of our leader from"
00:23:35,00:23:38,junction with Testi's to Tipov at space.
00:23:38,00:23:40,That's what she stood there for.
00:23:40,00:23:46,"Going back to the Slovak thing, there was a Slovak cultural group in America, and they"
00:23:46,00:23:51,"had a big map of their country, and there was an old guy came in, and he was looking around"
00:23:51,00:23:55,"and they asked what he was doing, and he was trying to find his grandfather's village, because"
00:23:55,00:23:58,his grandfather was from there.
00:23:58,00:24:02,"But then his wife came over to him and she looked at the sign and said, ""You're not Slovakia"
00:24:02,00:24:03,"Slovenian!"""
00:24:03,00:24:10,"Some of his guy got his whole life thinking of Slovakia, then he was actually Slovenian."
00:24:10,00:24:18,"If they don't know, how can you know, the rest of the world know?"
00:24:18,00:24:19,That's great.
00:24:19,00:24:24,"Yeah, I read about, there was a new couple, I think they just got married, and they wanted"
00:24:24,00:24:29,"to get a flight to Sydney, and they bought the flight, and it was a lot cheaper than they"
00:24:29,00:24:30,thought.
00:24:30,00:24:37,"And when they got there, they found out that they'd actually gone to Sydney Nova Scotia by accident."
00:24:37,00:24:41,"This is, unlike Jars, you're from Sydney, aren't you?"
00:24:41,00:24:46,"Unlike Jars Sydney, this is a former mining town with a population of 26,083, and one of the"
00:24:46,00:24:48,highest unemployment rates in Canada.
00:24:48,00:24:51,It does have a very nice opera house.
00:24:51,00:24:59,"Well, this couple, they said, ""Oh, we're just going to make the most of it,"" and they were"
00:24:59,00:25:04,looking forward to looking at the pickup trucks and eating the local lobster.
00:25:04,00:25:05,Brilliant.
00:25:05,00:25:06,That's fantastic.
00:25:06,00:25:08,"Yeah, that's a good opportunity."
00:25:08,00:25:09,Yeah.
00:25:09,00:25:13,"Okay, so I was looking at other mix-ups, and I saw a newspaper story."
00:25:13,00:25:18,The FDA in America was warning people not to mix up the prescription eyedrops called
00:25:18,00:25:24,"Juresol, with the acid-containing watt-remover Juresol."
00:25:24,00:25:29,"Apparently, these are two medicines with very similar names, and people have been putting"
00:25:29,00:25:32,"this acid in their eyes, thinking it was eyedrops."
00:25:32,00:25:33,"Oh, my God."
00:25:33,00:25:37,And that got me to thinking if there's any other medicines with similar names and what could
00:25:37,00:25:38,happen.
00:25:38,00:25:43,I found a brilliant list online of commonly confused medicines.
00:25:43,00:25:47,"So there's a drug called Allegra, which is a drug often used for the temporary relief"
00:25:47,00:25:51,"of runny nose, and people keep getting that mixed up with Viagra."
00:25:51,00:25:52,Ah.
00:25:52,00:25:53,That's their excuse.
00:25:53,00:25:54,Yeah.
00:25:54,00:26:00,But there's something that actually helps to cook carrots and potatoes.
00:26:00,00:26:01,It's called Vegicil.
00:26:01,00:26:06,Some people confuse it.
00:26:06,00:26:09,And there was another thing called Bino.
00:26:09,00:26:12,"This was a company name, and it was an anti-gas thing."
00:26:12,00:26:16,"If you've got a bit of gas, you take this Bino, and it makes you feel better."
00:26:16,00:26:21,"But people were mistaking it for B&O, which is Beladonna and Opium."
00:26:21,00:26:22,"Oh, wow."
00:26:22,00:26:25,And anything to add?
00:26:25,00:26:28,Just another Slovakia Slovenia.
00:26:28,00:26:31,"They've basically got really similar flags as well, which doesn't help."
00:26:31,00:26:33,They've got a white blue red stripe with a shield on the front.
00:26:33,00:26:36,"Shields are different, everything else is the same."
00:26:36,00:26:40,"So Slovenia have done a contest to find a new flag, but I don't think they've adopted it"
00:26:40,00:26:43,"yet, which will distinguish them."
00:26:43,00:26:47,And then there's a professor from the University of...
00:26:47,00:26:55,"The University of Libliyana, who said he reckons a problem with the confusion, is that Slovenia"
00:26:55,00:26:56,hasn't got a brand.
00:26:56,00:27:00,"Finland is Nokia and Sweden has like here, and they need their own brand."
00:27:00,00:27:03,"But someone suggested Slovenia becomes the one-hour country, because you can get everywhere"
00:27:03,00:27:04,within an hour.
00:27:04,00:27:06,It's very small.
00:27:06,00:27:12,"And then with the confusion as well, there was that thing at the London Olympics when the"
00:27:12,00:27:16,"North Korean women's football team walked off, because they showed the South Korean flag,"
00:27:16,00:27:18,not the North Korean.
00:27:18,00:27:19,That's very embarrassing.
00:27:19,00:27:24,They did not go down well welcoming them with the wrong flag.
00:27:24,00:27:27,"And just at the end, you're Bino, and there was a second Dennis Menis who made his debut"
00:27:27,00:27:28,in America.
00:27:28,00:27:34,"Of course, literally within five days of being debuted, yeah, the Americas, Dennis Menis,"
00:27:34,00:27:38,"and they had a very similar look, and they were done completely independently of each other."
00:27:38,00:27:41,It was like deep impact in Armageddon.
00:27:41,00:27:43,I'm from Bonteno and Dante's peak.
00:27:43,00:27:44,Yep.
00:27:44,00:27:46,Any others?
00:27:46,00:27:48,"Um, Genesis and Exodus."
00:27:48,00:27:49,The bands?
00:27:49,00:27:50,No.
00:27:50,00:28:02,"So, let's move on to our final fact of the show, and we come on to Mr. Andy Murray."
00:28:02,00:28:03,Andy.
00:28:03,00:28:04,Okay.
00:28:04,00:28:09,"My fact is, in the 18th century, there were genuine medsons called Alan's nipple liniment,"
00:28:09,00:28:16,"Grimston's eye snuff, Miller's worm plums, and Italian bussam friend."
00:28:16,00:28:19,"Do you know what was in any of them, or..."
00:28:19,00:28:23,"Well, somebody said that Grimston's eye snuff was just pepper, just black pepper ground"
00:28:23,00:28:24,up.
00:28:24,00:28:31,"But a lot of patent medsons really consisted only of sort of 50% alcohol, so they were..."
00:28:31,00:28:36,"And a lot of them, we call them patent medsons, of course, all these fantastically named old"
00:28:36,00:28:38,hamlin's wizard oil.
00:28:38,00:28:39,"Just, you know, beautifully named..."
00:28:39,00:28:40,How I want that.
00:28:40,00:28:41,Yeah.
00:28:41,00:28:47,"Sugar plums for worms, aromatic lozen jizz of steel, cockings, coff lozen jizz, gingerbread"
00:28:47,00:28:48,worm cakes.
00:28:48,00:28:52,"For some of them that did have active ingredients, there was one called Mrs. Winslow's soothing"
00:28:52,00:28:54,syrup.
00:28:54,00:29:01,"And that was a mainly a baby's and children, and it contained a full gram of morphine per ounce."
00:29:01,00:29:03,"And cops' baby friend, that was another baby one."
00:29:03,00:29:05,Cops' baby friend.
00:29:05,00:29:12,And the label there boasted 8.5% alcohol and 1/8th grain sulfate of opium per ounce.
00:29:12,00:29:15,And that was marketed to help baby sleep.
00:29:15,00:29:16,Yeah.
00:29:16,00:29:20,"You could buy heroin, couldn't you, in the first world war, to send to troops on the front"
00:29:20,00:29:21,line?
00:29:21,00:29:22,Yeah.
00:29:22,00:29:23,"But I didn't harrods, I think."
00:29:23,00:29:24,"Really, I think so."
00:29:24,00:29:25,"Still can, I think."
00:29:25,00:29:26,I'm not.
00:29:26,00:29:27,It's a count.
00:29:27,00:29:28,"Yeah, but behind harrods."
00:29:28,00:29:29,We should fact.
00:29:29,00:29:30,(LAUGHTER)
00:29:30,00:29:37,"Has anyone heard about, during the Middle Ages, when there was the Black Death, that Farts"
00:29:37,00:29:40,in a jar was a thing that was prescribed for people?
00:29:40,00:29:46,"Yeah, the idea was that if you conditioned the smell of something quite disgusting,"
00:29:46,00:29:49,"to your nose by the time, if there was an outbreak of Black Death around you, you would become"
00:29:49,00:29:53,"accustomed to that kind of smell, so it kind of made you immune to what was going to happen."
00:29:53,00:29:56,"So you would go to the doctor, and they would give you a fart in a jar."
00:29:56,00:30:00,"I don't know if it was your own fart, or if it was a pre-packaged fart, and you would"
00:30:00,00:30:01,go home with it.
00:30:01,00:30:03,"And then you would rip open the lid, have a sniff."
00:30:03,00:30:06,In case of emergency brake glass.
00:30:06,00:30:07,(LAUGHTER)
00:30:07,00:30:08,Rake wind.
00:30:08,00:30:09,(LAUGHTER)
00:30:09,00:30:10,That's incredible.
00:30:10,00:30:13,"What is that, like an early version of the vaccination idea?"
00:30:13,00:30:14,Sort of.
00:30:14,00:30:18,"Making small doses of a poison to build up a resistance, which is the Roman Emperor's"
00:30:18,00:30:19,did.
00:30:19,00:30:20,"Yes, exactly."
00:30:20,00:30:21,To build up the resistance.
00:30:21,00:30:23,You were not putting up a resistance to your own farts.
00:30:23,00:30:27,"Well, it was fair enough, when I had, which I've been doing for years."
00:30:27,00:30:34,"When I had my appendix taken out, they cut in testing by accident, and stomach acid"
00:30:34,00:30:37,"was pouring out, and I was digesting myself, right?"
00:30:37,00:30:41,"So I was in hospital for like three months, and you know, I wasn't allowed to eat anything,"
00:30:41,00:30:47,"so because I wasn't allowed to eat anything, because nothing worked, I also confirmed."
00:30:47,00:30:52,"So there was gas trapped inside, and the nurses did say, ""You're allowed to leave or eat"
00:30:52,00:30:57,"when you can fart,"" and it took me two months to essentially release any gas."
00:30:57,00:31:04,"And when it came out, it was the worst thing I've ever, ever, ever, but what was also really"
00:31:04,00:31:08,horrible was that I had to call the nurse to make a smell it.
00:31:08,00:31:09,(LAUGHTER)
00:31:09,00:31:10,Which is the opposite.
00:31:10,00:31:13,I have a feeling you didn't really have to call out.
00:31:13,00:31:15,She's probably already ringing your taxi.
00:31:15,00:31:19,"She's probably got a matching story about the worst thing she's ever smelled, and he called"
00:31:19,00:31:23,"me in to smell it, it wasn't that."
00:31:23,00:31:28,The other cool thing about a lot of these medicines that I really like is that beyond all the
00:31:28,00:31:32,"kind of crazy names they had, some of them probably worked better than a lot of medical"
00:31:32,00:31:37,"alternatives, which were being touted by real doctors, I doctors with medical degrees"
00:31:37,00:31:38,at the time.
00:31:38,00:31:39,Right.
00:31:39,00:31:44,"And things like homeopathy, in the 18th century, homeopathy was your best bet, because all the"
00:31:44,00:31:48,other medicines were more likely to kill you and likely to kill you quite fast.
00:31:48,00:31:53,"So that, I think, has accounted for a lot of alternative and complementary medicines today,"
00:31:53,00:31:56,"still being popular, is that it had an initial lead."
00:31:56,00:31:57,Yeah.
00:31:57,00:32:01,"They used to call them snake oil salesmen, they still do a little bit, don't they?"
00:32:01,00:32:02,Yeah.
00:32:02,00:32:05,And I remember reading that actually snake oil is good for you.
00:32:05,00:32:13,"If someone sold you some snake oil, it contains 20% of omega-3s, which is a thing that people"
00:32:13,00:32:17,"like to take, it's supposed to be good for your heart, and salmon, which is one thing that"
00:32:17,00:32:20,people do take for omega-3 on the contains 18%.
00:32:20,00:32:22,So actually snake oil would do you a bit of good?
00:32:22,00:32:26,"I think it's all these medicines, it's trial and error."
00:32:26,00:32:33,"So at the beginning of medicine time, you know, trying some honey with hedgehog hair, you"
00:32:33,00:32:34,never know.
00:32:34,00:32:35,"You'd be like, yeah, just try that."
00:32:35,00:32:36,Yeah.
00:32:36,00:32:37,For your eyes.
00:32:37,00:32:38,"For your eyes, probably as well."
00:32:38,00:32:43,"The last thing when you're in pain, you're a little bit delirious, and you'll turn to your"
00:32:43,00:32:47,"friend, your internet friend, just to go, what do I take?"
00:32:47,00:32:48,"And they'll just say, oh, yeah, just do that."
00:32:48,00:32:49,And you will do it.
00:32:49,00:32:50,Yeah.
00:32:50,00:32:57,There's a group of people in the Amazon who they like to put snakes down their trousers
00:32:57,00:33:00,"to bite their penises, which gives them length and directions, and I wonder how they"
00:33:00,00:33:01,found that out.
00:33:01,00:33:07,"They're really just trying to cure their runny noses, that's what they claim."
00:33:07,00:33:11,"I was reading a lot about placebo, in relation to, you know, this kind of medicine."
00:33:11,00:33:12,This is incredible.
00:33:12,00:33:20,"There was a drug introduced in the 70s called Cymetadine, which cured 80% of stomach ulcers."
00:33:20,00:33:25,"Now as time passed, it felt just 50% of stomach ulcers which it cured."
00:33:25,00:33:30,"And this seems to have occurred after the introduction of renitadine, which is a competing"
00:33:30,00:33:33,"and it was supposedly a better, more effective drug."
00:33:33,00:33:38,So people think that the placebo effect of the initial drug stopped working because doctors
00:33:38,00:33:44,"knew there was another supposedly better drug, and that's why the success rate fell."
00:33:44,00:33:48,"Because doctors have also been tested giving medicine to patients, and half of them have"
00:33:48,00:33:49,"said, I think this is a really good drug."
00:33:49,00:33:51,I'm very excited about it.
00:33:51,00:33:52,It's shown really well in trials.
00:33:52,00:33:56,"And half of them have said, I'm not sure about this, but take it anyway, see if it does"
00:33:56,00:34:02,"be good, patients have reported much less pain with the first sample adopted, same pill."
00:34:02,00:34:03,It's incredible.
00:34:03,00:34:04,Wow.
00:34:04,00:34:05,Yeah.
00:34:05,00:34:07,"And placebo injections are more effective than placebo pills, because it's more dramatic"
00:34:07,00:34:08,intervention.
00:34:08,00:34:10,It feels culturally people think that.
00:34:10,00:34:13,I wonder if placebo works with all of these really weird things that they did in the
00:34:13,00:34:16,"light, the middle ages and stuff like that."
00:34:16,00:34:20,"So like, for instance, in the 14th century, one reason, one way that you could cure impotence"
00:34:20,00:34:24,was to wear your trousers on your head for 24 hours.
00:34:24,00:34:27,It's hard to imagine the placebo effect work in that.
00:34:27,00:34:31,It's hard to imagine finding anyone who wants to have sex with you after you're on the
00:34:31,00:34:33,village all day with the trousers on your head.
00:34:33,00:34:35,Speak for yourself.
00:34:35,00:34:36,"The placebo effect doesn't always work, though."
00:34:36,00:34:41,"I was reading about Greek philosopher Heraclitus, who spent the last day of his life laying"
00:34:41,00:34:48,"the sun, covered in cow dung, convinced it would cure him, and it didn't work."
00:34:48,00:34:56,"Curum of, from what, friendship?"
00:34:56,00:35:04,"Perfectly right, just to add that it was until 1916 that you could buy cocaine and heroin"
00:35:04,00:35:05,at Harrods.
00:35:05,00:35:09,"I thought this was a joke or not, but in the article it said, you could buy gift packs of"
00:35:09,00:35:11,both the send to soldiers.
00:35:11,00:35:12,Yeah.
00:35:12,00:35:13,Wow.
00:35:13,00:35:14,That's true.
00:35:14,00:35:15,It was a very nice little Christmas gift.
00:35:15,00:35:18,"I had fun when you were talking, watching the weirdest YouTube video I've ever seen"
00:35:18,00:35:21,"about how to bottle your farts, so thanks for that."
00:35:21,00:35:26,"According to N-miniac, the way to do it is to do it while you're in the bath, because that's"
00:35:26,00:35:30,"how you can best direct said fart to jar, but what I quite like was he began his video by"
00:35:30,00:35:33,washing out the jar before he put the farts in.
00:35:33,00:35:36,"Oh, yeah, you don't want to get that jar dirty."
00:35:36,00:35:37,Yeah.
00:35:37,00:35:41,"I just sort of quickly add that from the website that I got the farts in the jar from,"
00:35:41,00:35:45,"there was a line at the bottom talking about, because it gave examples of how it was done"
00:35:45,00:35:46,and so on.
00:35:46,00:35:50,"It's sounds funny now, but the plague was no joke."
00:35:50,00:36:05,"OK, that's it for another episode of No Such Thing as a Fish."
00:36:05,00:36:06,That's all of our facts.
00:36:06,00:36:07,"Thanks so much, everyone, for listening."
00:36:07,00:36:12,"If you want to get in touch with us to question us about anything, you can get us all on Twitter."

00:36:24,00:36:26,"It's my name, Eric Lampair, Eric Lampair."
00:36:26,00:36:27,Eric Lampair.
00:36:27,00:36:31,"And of course, if you want to explore any of the topics that we've spoken about a bit more,"
00:36:31,00:36:35,"you can head to the qi.com/podcastpage, where we're going to have lots of links, we're"
00:36:35,00:36:39,"going to have videos, we're going to have pictures, anything that we've spoken about, hopefully"

00:36:41,00:36:44,And we're going to be back again next week with another podcast.
