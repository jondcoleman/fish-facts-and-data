1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,680
 We run it on QI a few years ago.

2
00:00:01,680 --> 00:00:02,200
 Yeah.

3
00:00:02,200 --> 00:00:04,360
 Um, which was, there's no such thing as a fish.

4
00:00:04,360 --> 00:00:05,680
 It ended up not such thing as a fish.

5
00:00:05,680 --> 00:00:09,680
 No, seriously, it's ended up the Oxford Dictionary of Underwater Life.

6
00:00:09,680 --> 00:00:11,520
 It says it right there, first paragraph.

7
00:00:11,520 --> 00:00:12,600
 No such thing as a fish.

8
00:00:12,600 --> 00:00:29,800
 Hello, and welcome to another episode of "No Such Thing"

9
00:00:29,800 --> 00:00:33,400
 as a fish coming to you from the QI offices in Covert Garden.

10
00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:34,480
 My name is Dan Treiber.

11
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:39,240
 I'm sitting here with three other QI elves, James Harkin, Andy Murray,

12
00:00:39,240 --> 00:00:41,800
 and on fact-checking Judy's this week, Ann Miller.

13
00:00:41,800 --> 00:00:44,440
 And once again, we're going to go over our favorite facts

14
00:00:44,440 --> 00:00:45,640
 from the last seven days.

15
00:00:45,640 --> 00:00:48,760
 Joining us today, we have a special guest, a comedian

16
00:00:48,760 --> 00:00:50,560
 and friend of ours, Eric Lamper.

17
00:00:50,560 --> 00:00:51,800
 Hello, how are you doing, mate?

18
00:00:51,800 --> 00:00:52,600
 I'm very good, thanks.

19
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:54,760
 Eric is a good friend of ours.

20
00:00:54,760 --> 00:00:55,880
 He's a comedian.

21
00:00:55,880 --> 00:00:59,400
 He recently, as a stand-up, opened for Eddie Isard.

22
00:00:59,400 --> 00:01:01,240
 In French, it was a French gig.

23
00:01:01,240 --> 00:01:03,560
 And Eric did his set in French entirely.

24
00:01:03,560 --> 00:01:05,560
 He's also going to star in an upcoming movie

25
00:01:05,560 --> 00:01:07,240
 called Amstar Dam.

26
00:01:07,240 --> 00:01:08,240
 Yeah, that's true.

27
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:10,520
 Yeah, I think it'll be here, I think.

28
00:01:10,520 --> 00:01:11,480
 Oh, what's it about?

29
00:01:11,480 --> 00:01:12,320
 So it's not bad.

30
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:14,520
 It's like a fairy tale world.

31
00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:16,800
 It is a stoner film with that name.

32
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:18,440
 Yeah, I'm quite excited, you know.

33
00:01:18,440 --> 00:01:20,000
 Based in Neverlands.

34
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,880
 Yeah, so it's in Amsterdam, yeah.

35
00:01:21,880 --> 00:01:24,240
 And I can't really reveal too much.

36
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:27,000
 I have a fact about Amsterdam to hear it.

37
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,840
 I can't remember what year it was, it was about, I don't know,

38
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:30,840
 80 years or so ago.

39
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:33,840
 But there was a fog so bad that 29 people

40
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:38,200
 fell into the canals in a single night.

41
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:39,520
 That's fantastic.

42
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:41,520
 OK, let's start with fact number one.

43
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:43,920
 And we're going to start with our special guest, Eric.

44
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:46,320
 [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

45
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:50,480
 In 1923, Jockey Frank Hayes won a race in Belmont Park

46
00:01:50,480 --> 00:01:53,640
 in New York, despite being dead.

47
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:54,160
 Wow.

48
00:01:54,160 --> 00:01:55,480
 OK, so explain that one.

49
00:01:55,480 --> 00:01:55,920
 Yeah.

50
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:57,840
 No, he started alive, right?

51
00:01:57,840 --> 00:01:58,920
 He started alive.

52
00:01:58,920 --> 00:01:59,840
 Oh.

53
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:01,120
 So he died mid-race?

54
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:02,800
 Mid-race, yeah.

55
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:04,280
 OK, give us more of the story.

56
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:07,800
 Well, basically, he suffered from a heart attack mid-race.

57
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:10,800
 But he was straddled nice and strong in the saddle.

58
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:12,280
 And the horse won.

59
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:15,080
 But how does-- is there a seat belt?

60
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:16,920
 Maybe he killed over, right?

61
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:19,120
 Yeah, but you're not going to move his chains, sort of like,

62
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:20,440
 slammed over, can I think.

63
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:23,240
 So he's got his feet nice and strapped in.

64
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:26,960
 And you've got your hands, as well, sort of tied around the--

65
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:27,960
 the reins.

66
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:28,960
 Oh, yeah.

67
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:31,080
 Did anyone notice during the race?

68
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:33,200
 It was the only discovered after he had won.

69
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:35,560
 He was probably the only one who was just kept running

70
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:37,600
 more and more laps.

71
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:40,280
 He's probably the only one not hitting the horse.

72
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:41,720
 Yeah, yes, still won.

73
00:02:41,720 --> 00:02:43,480
 What does that say about cruelty?

74
00:02:43,480 --> 00:02:45,560
 Yeah, listen, this horse-- am I right in saying

75
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:46,920
 it was called sweet kiss?

76
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:48,360
 Sweet, sweet kiss of death.

77
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:49,280
 Sweet kiss of death.

78
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:50,960
 That's what they nicknamed it afterwards.

79
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:51,280
 Is it?

80
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:51,800
 Yeah.

81
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:52,600
 Wow.

82
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:54,160
 This is an interesting link.

83
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:56,560
 Your dad, Eric, is a jockie, isn't he?

84
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:58,440
 Yeah, I mean, that's one of the reasons why I thought.

85
00:02:58,440 --> 00:03:01,320
 I mean, I only found out this fact this week.

86
00:03:01,320 --> 00:03:03,880
 But yeah, my dad is indeed a jockie.

87
00:03:03,880 --> 00:03:06,080
 Because you're pretty tall, if you don't mind me saying.

88
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:12,200
 Yeah, and I've got big gums as well, which has never helped.

89
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:14,080
 As school they'd be like, oh, clearly your dad's

90
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:15,640
 had sex with a horse.

91
00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:18,240
 It's all fair.

92
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:19,800
 Unfortunately, I'm hung like a human.

93
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:23,200
 [LAUGHTER]

94
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:25,320
 You know the way that jockie's sit.

95
00:03:25,320 --> 00:03:28,280
 It's kind of like a crouched thing where they're leaning forward.

96
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:30,320
 Not the dead ones, the alive ones.

97
00:03:30,320 --> 00:03:32,440
 This is called the monkey crouch.

98
00:03:32,440 --> 00:03:36,480
 And it was invented by a guy called Todd Sloan in 1897.

99
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:38,360
 And what's interesting about it is no one

100
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:40,560
 rode horses like that before in horse races.

101
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:43,120
 And when he invented that, horse race times and records

102
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:46,480
 improved by 5% to 7% in a single year.

103
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:48,240
 So he just completely changed the spot

104
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:50,520
 by deciding to crouch down on lean forward.

105
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:51,520
 No one had ever done it before.

106
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:52,520
 Wow, that's amazing.

107
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:54,120
 That's like the, um, in the foes.

108
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:55,680
 Yeah, in high jump.

109
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:56,480
 Yes.

110
00:03:56,480 --> 00:03:59,640
 I mean, that completely transformed the sport, didn't it?

111
00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:02,680
 We did a couple of years ago, the new way of throwing a javelin,

112
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:05,000
 which was invented very briefly in the 1930s,

113
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:08,840
 which is to hold it by one end, swing around, and let go.

114
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:09,360
 The javelin.

115
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:10,880
 Yeah, like throwing the hammer.

116
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:15,840
 And it was banned almost immediately for obvious reasons.

117
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:18,640
 But it did provide amazingly long javelin throws.

118
00:04:18,640 --> 00:04:20,760
 In fact, to the extent that it could have been quite dangerous,

119
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:23,040
 A, because it goes too far and might have spectators,

120
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:27,640
 and B, because it's very hard to get it in exactly the right direction.

121
00:04:27,640 --> 00:04:30,160
 It's getting paled to say it's incredible.

122
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:37,760
 A slight margin of error in the Paris Olympics in 1904, 1900.

123
00:04:37,760 --> 00:04:38,880
 Paris 1900, yeah.

124
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:39,760
 Paris 1900.

125
00:04:39,760 --> 00:04:42,960
 People trained in the public parks, javelins.

126
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:45,320
 And they had to be warm to be extra vigilant.

127
00:04:45,320 --> 00:04:49,160
 Some people trained at night, so there was less chance of hitting people.

128
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:52,200
 But also more chance of hitting people.

129
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:56,480
 The interesting thing about javelins is that they make them lesser or dynamic

130
00:04:56,480 --> 00:05:00,400
 as the time goes on, because the length of a running track

131
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:02,520
 is always going to be about 100 meters.

132
00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:05,840
 And so what they do is they have to make sure the javelin can't be thrown more

133
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:06,480
 than that.

134
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:09,560
 People get stronger and stronger and better, and they get closer to 100 meters.

135
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:13,280
 And then they always make the javelins a little bit worse so that people can't get that far.

136
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:20,360
 By the end, it'll just be like a toothpick, not really a heavy toothpick.

137
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:22,520
 Wow, OK, so what were you always out with at the--

138
00:05:22,520 --> 00:05:26,840
 I was 18 and 97 when he discovered that idea.

139
00:05:26,840 --> 00:05:28,360
 OK, that's amazing.

140
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:33,160
 It's an interesting thing when you start looking into what people have achieved once they've

141
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:34,560
 died.

142
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:38,640
 There's a really one of my favorite stories from the Gnobel's world.

143
00:05:38,640 --> 00:05:41,200
 We've had Mark Abrams, the founder, on a few podcasts ago.

144
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:46,280
 And he wrote a book years ago called The Gnobel Prizes 2, Why Chickens Prefer Beautiful Humans.

145
00:05:46,280 --> 00:05:52,440
 There's a fantastic story about a man called Laal Bahari, who in 1975, when he went to the bank

146
00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:58,480
 to apply for a loan, he discovered that he'd been declared dead by his uncle, who wanted

147
00:05:58,480 --> 00:06:02,800
 to declare him dead in order to get the land rights for the farm that he owned.

148
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:09,040
 And he spent 19 years as a dead man trying to get recognized as a living man.

149
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:10,680
 And it just no one would recognize him.

150
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:14,320
 And he did incredible things like he stood for parliaments.

151
00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:18,080
 He tried to get arrested countless times because they arrested him technically, it meant

152
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:19,320
 he was alive.

153
00:06:19,320 --> 00:06:20,320
 So they couldn't arrest him.

154
00:06:20,320 --> 00:06:21,320
 He would do all this stuff.

155
00:06:21,320 --> 00:06:23,440
 And they're like, we can't arrest you because you're dead.

156
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:29,120
 And so for 19 years, he stayed dead technically and he finally got a court to overturn it.

157
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:32,600
 And he set up in his town where he lived.

158
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:38,400
 And I think for all of India, which is where he's from, a whole network and a group in support

159
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:41,720
 of people who have been declared dead, who are in fact alive.

160
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:43,840
 Oh, I'd love to have that power.

161
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:45,240
 That's so amazing.

162
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:49,000
 It's called the Association of Dead People that he created.

163
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:52,000
 And it was in 1994 that he was finally proven to be alive.

164
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:56,480
 It's a massive problem as well, in places where the paperwork often doesn't catch up with

165
00:06:56,480 --> 00:07:00,920
 people's actual legal status or whether or alive or not, that it happens a great deal.

166
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:02,880
 It's why there's a need for an association, you know?

167
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:03,880
 Was that in India?

168
00:07:03,880 --> 00:07:04,880
 Yes, it was.

169
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:07,600
 Well, I do believe in reincarnation, that's why he was born again.

170
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:08,600
 That's possible.

171
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:13,960
 Well, let's go back to horse racing and jockey and stuff like that.

172
00:07:13,960 --> 00:07:20,280
 And there was a jockey, a very successful one called Lafitte, Pinque, Jr. And in order to

173
00:07:20,280 --> 00:07:25,520
 keep his weight down, he would take a single peanut, slice it into slivers and eat just half

174
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:26,920
 of it for lunch.

175
00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:29,680
 The dieting for a jockey is actually mad.

176
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:34,680
 So like me and my mum and my mum's French, so we'd eat like so much, we'd probably pick

177
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:35,680
 out.

178
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:38,880
 But he'd always eat salads and stuff.

179
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:44,320
 And then I remember when we were in South Africa for one of his races and he carved himself

180
00:07:44,320 --> 00:07:46,200
 in black bin bags, right?

181
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:49,200
 And just sell it taped all the way up to his neck.

182
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:54,120
 And then he pushed a wheelbarrow full of things and he ran around with the wheelbarrow around

183
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:55,680
 the field to lose the weight.

184
00:07:55,680 --> 00:08:01,200
 And then I remember he took off all the black bin bags and it just pulled out like a waterfall.

185
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:02,200
 It was disgusting.

186
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:03,200
 That's amazing.

187
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:07,840
 I also read the people's speed walk, a jockey speed walk instead of run because they don't

188
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:09,880
 want to put an extra muscle, don't know if that's good.

189
00:08:09,880 --> 00:08:10,880
 Muscle weight.

190
00:08:10,880 --> 00:08:11,880
 Muscle weight, yeah.

191
00:08:11,880 --> 00:08:12,880
 Muscle weight.

192
00:08:12,880 --> 00:08:13,880
 Muscle weight, yeah.

193
00:08:13,880 --> 00:08:14,880
 Is it AP McCoy?

194
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:15,880
 Yeah.

195
00:08:15,880 --> 00:08:16,880
 He's one of the great jockeys of time.

196
00:08:16,880 --> 00:08:17,880
 Yeah, I lived near him.

197
00:08:17,880 --> 00:08:18,880
 Do you?

198
00:08:18,880 --> 00:08:19,880
 New market, yeah.

199
00:08:19,880 --> 00:08:23,320
 He has very intensive, almost-golding-hot baths.

200
00:08:23,320 --> 00:08:26,360
 Same reason I think, to sweat out so much of the water in his body.

201
00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:29,600
 He does it for a couple of hours, a couple of times a day before a race.

202
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:30,600
 Yeah.

203
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:35,400
 Like sometimes I'll commit a crime leader, police, just to see if they get away with it.

204
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:37,520
 That's like two stones gone.

205
00:08:37,520 --> 00:08:41,080
 Okay, before we move on, Anne, have you got any facts you want to-

206
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:42,080
 Yeah, I do.

207
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:44,600
 James's Amsterdam fog was in 1893.

208
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:48,280
 It was 79 people who fell into the canals that one night.

209
00:08:48,280 --> 00:08:51,320
 So what's where you're going in fog?

210
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:56,920
 Frank Hayes, the New York Times, reckoned that he died just after his horse took lead

211
00:08:56,920 --> 00:08:58,280
 before he finished.

212
00:08:58,280 --> 00:09:05,760
 And they put it down to his heavy training regime, and his excitement coming first, which so-

213
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:07,760
 Well, the horse is excitement.

214
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:08,760
 Frank Hayes' excitement.

215
00:09:08,760 --> 00:09:09,760
 Oh, okay.

216
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:12,560
 Have he been working so hard, and then he suddenly saw he was about to win, and that made

217
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:13,560
 a big deal.

218
00:09:13,560 --> 00:09:14,560
 Well, it gave way.

219
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:18,200
 There is a tumbler I found called Curious History, I haven't seen them before, but they

220
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:22,760
 are probably one of the 20 best tumblers in the world, according to MSN, and they say

221
00:09:22,760 --> 00:09:27,200
 their spectators thought he was showing off and was riding one-handed, kind of like riding

222
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:28,200
 a bike with no hands.

223
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:33,280
 See, it's going over the line, and then when he realized he died till the race was over,

224
00:09:33,280 --> 00:09:37,720
 which the javelin spinning round technique, actually quite effective, the current world

225
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:46,000
 record was 83 meters, and the guy who spun around threw 112, but was then disallowed, because

226
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:49,720
 yeah, didn't want the copycats, that was in 1966.

227
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:52,320
 So the world record for javelin has been disqualified at the time?

228
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:55,520
 Well, that one was because he did not want the world over your head.

229
00:09:55,520 --> 00:10:04,680
 I don't think anyone's got that far, but the thing is every time they change the javelin,

230
00:10:04,680 --> 00:10:08,560
 that invalidates all previous records, because you're not on a level playing field.

231
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:13,360
 Yeah, the current record is with the current javelin is 98.48 meters, so still less than the

232
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:14,880
 guy who spun over his head.

233
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:15,880
 That's amazing.

234
00:10:15,880 --> 00:10:16,880
 So yeah, it's pretty good.

235
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:17,880
 Good.

236
00:10:17,880 --> 00:10:18,880
 Factional Nuggets.

237
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:28,000
 Okay, let's move on to fact number two.

238
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:33,880
 Fact number two is my fact, and that is that some Buddhist monks run marathons to achieve

239
00:10:33,880 --> 00:10:35,840
 enlightenment.

240
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:42,480
 So this is a, I think, extraordinary endurance test.

241
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:46,880
 Kind of seems like it's the greatest endurance test on our planet, which is done by these

242
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:51,920
 monks who are known as the marathon monks, and these marathon monks achieve enlightenment

243
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:57,400
 by going on these huge thousand day running challenges that go over the course of seven

244
00:10:57,400 --> 00:11:05,380
 years, and each year they have to do 100 days in one chunk of running a distance per day.

245
00:11:05,380 --> 00:11:10,440
 So 30 kilometers for the first 100 days, then they take a break, then they do another 100

246
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:14,920
 days next year and year two, they do 30 kilometers again per day.

247
00:11:14,920 --> 00:11:19,800
 Number three, it's 30 kilometers again, and it's 30 for four, and then for five they do 200

248
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:20,800
 day straight.

249
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:25,760
 On year six it jumps up to 60 kilometers per day for 100 day straight, and then in year

250
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:31,360
 seven it's 84 kilometers per day for 100 day straight, and then 30 kilometers additional

251
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:33,280
 100 days after that.

252
00:11:33,280 --> 00:11:38,760
 And if at any point during this whole process they fail to reach the number that they're

253
00:11:38,760 --> 00:11:42,120
 meant to reach on that target, they kill themselves.

254
00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:47,720
 And only 46 people in the hundred years or so that this has been going on had successfully

255
00:11:47,720 --> 00:11:48,720
 completed it.

256
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:51,840
 So they kill themselves if they haven't already died in the meantime.

257
00:11:51,840 --> 00:11:52,840
 Exactly.

258
00:11:52,840 --> 00:11:56,360
 But if they sort of if they run short by a couple of kilometers, they carry, they dress

259
00:11:56,360 --> 00:12:00,000
 in white because the white is the symbol of the color of death.

260
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,720
 So they're dressed for death.

261
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:04,160
 They bring a sword and a rope.

262
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:05,160
 So they can either.

263
00:12:05,160 --> 00:12:06,160
 Sounds a lot.

264
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:07,160
 A couple of camera.

265
00:12:07,160 --> 00:12:11,320
 Are you sure you've got your packs right?

266
00:12:11,320 --> 00:12:16,760
 Yeah, so they have the option of hanging themselves or of stabbing themselves.

267
00:12:16,760 --> 00:12:19,200
 I think they may not still kill themselves.

268
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:23,800
 I think they haven't since the since the 19th century, I think it's been officially a bit

269
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:24,800
 discouraged.

270
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:25,800
 Yeah, yeah, it's been.

271
00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:26,800
 That's true.

272
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:27,800
 The original hard.

273
00:12:27,800 --> 00:12:33,240
 I mean, there is an area near the mountain where these monks live in Japan, which is called

274
00:12:33,240 --> 00:12:34,320
 the mountain high.

275
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:38,880
 I don't know how to pronounce that properly, it's H-I-E-I, and it's littered with unmarked

276
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:44,640
 graves from the people pre-19th century monks who did not manage to finish and complete

277
00:12:44,640 --> 00:12:46,960
 it and had to kill themselves as a result.

278
00:12:46,960 --> 00:12:50,200
 But the idea is that if you do complete it, you get a medal.

279
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:54,360
 You get a nice little medal, you get to get it back and those flowers and they still will

280
00:12:54,360 --> 00:12:57,720
 blanket around you for when you finish it.

281
00:12:57,720 --> 00:13:01,960
 Well, actually, you say silver blanket, but one thing that I found out about monks is

282
00:13:01,960 --> 00:13:08,560
 that they have a technique where they can heat themselves up.

283
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:13,440
 So it's a yoga technique called tummo, and they can enter like a deep meditation, and

284
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:21,720
 if there's a few monks around each other, and they can have like cold blankets on them,

285
00:13:21,720 --> 00:13:24,160
 and they can heat those blankets in a cold room.

286
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:25,160
 Wow.

287
00:13:25,160 --> 00:13:26,160
 And other people would die.

288
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:31,720
 There have been experiments on those guys who had wet blankets put on them, and they

289
00:13:31,720 --> 00:13:35,840
 started steaming until they were completely dry.

290
00:13:35,840 --> 00:13:40,360
 There isn't an endurance swimmer who we've covered on QI on TV, and he is able to raise

291
00:13:40,360 --> 00:13:45,840
 his body temperature by up to one or two degrees, because he swims in very icy water.

292
00:13:45,840 --> 00:13:49,760
 And I wrote to him and asked, is this true, and one of his representatives wrote back and

293
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:51,760
 said, "Yep, that's what he does."

294
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:54,320
 Let's go back to crazy monks.

295
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:55,320
 Yes, yeah.

296
00:13:55,320 --> 00:13:56,320
 Let's do that.

297
00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:59,600
 I'll tell you one more thing about the marathon monks just to bring us back in, which is

298
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:05,680
 that so 46 people only have ever completed this course.

299
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:09,680
 I think I've got the number wrong, and it would be great to know when this practice started,

300
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:14,840
 because I think it's either 100 years ago, 400 years ago, or 1000 years ago.

301
00:14:14,840 --> 00:14:19,200
 But 46 people have completed it.

302
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:20,840
 One guy did it twice.

303
00:14:20,840 --> 00:14:21,840
 Yeah.

304
00:14:21,840 --> 00:14:24,640
 He's super enlightened.

305
00:14:24,640 --> 00:14:25,640
 Yeah.

306
00:14:25,640 --> 00:14:27,360
 How many marathons has Eddie is up there?

307
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:28,360
 Yeah, quite a lot.

308
00:14:28,360 --> 00:14:30,360
 No, did he do six days?

309
00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:35,040
 Yeah, Eddie did 43 marathons in 51 days in 2009.

310
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:40,680
 Also, his marathons were presumably a lot shorter, I'm guessing.

311
00:14:40,680 --> 00:14:43,400
 No, I marathon is always the same distance, no?

312
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:45,920
 Although, they're not always the same distance.

313
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:51,680
 The original distance run after the Battle of Marathon was, I think, about 22 miles.

314
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:54,280
 It wasn't any more than 25, either.

315
00:14:54,280 --> 00:14:55,680
 And there was a lot of early flux.

316
00:14:55,680 --> 00:15:02,200
 But wasn't the first marathon by this guy that had to run from Argos to, like, somewhere else,

317
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:04,200
 because he was reporting on a battle.

318
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:05,200
 Oh, OK, the battle I was.

319
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:06,200
 There had been one.

320
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:07,600
 It wasn't that we've lost the battle.

321
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:09,880
 You need to flee immediately, I was, hey, we won, guys.

322
00:15:09,880 --> 00:15:12,400
 OK, right, so it was the Battle of Marathon.

323
00:15:12,400 --> 00:15:13,400
 That's it.

324
00:15:13,400 --> 00:15:15,240
 It wasn't actually called that one marathon, yeah.

325
00:15:15,240 --> 00:15:16,240
 Yeah, it was that one.

326
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:20,320
 There is a really interesting thing about the official modern marathon length,

327
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:24,440
 which is that it's 26 miles and 385 yards.

328
00:15:24,440 --> 00:15:28,080
 And it was only, it's only been the case since 1908.

329
00:15:28,080 --> 00:15:30,880
 And it was done to please the British royal family.

330
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:34,640
 Because Queen Alexandra wanted the race to start on the lawn at Windsor Castle,

331
00:15:34,640 --> 00:15:37,560
 so that her children could watch from the nursery window.

332
00:15:37,560 --> 00:15:39,200
 And then an extra mile was added to the race.

333
00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:42,760
 And then, at the end of the race, 385 yards were added, so that it could finish

334
00:15:42,760 --> 00:15:46,480
 in front of the royal box at the Olympic Stadium in White City.

335
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:51,160
 So it's all been done an extra mile and 385 yards.

336
00:15:51,160 --> 00:15:53,000
 At the Royal Wim.

337
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,240
 Here's the thing about crazy marathon.

338
00:15:55,240 --> 00:15:58,280
 So as a Italian athlete called Maro Prosperi.

339
00:15:58,280 --> 00:16:03,120
 And in 1994, he was running a marathon in the Moroccan Sahara.

340
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:04,760
 But he got lost.

341
00:16:04,760 --> 00:16:11,920
 And when they found him nine days later, he'd run 200 kilometers off course into Algeria.

342
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:15,880
 He'd lost 18 kilograms and only survived by drinking his own urine

343
00:16:15,880 --> 00:16:19,440
 and eating bats that he found in an abandoned mosque.

344
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:21,760
 Wow.

345
00:16:21,760 --> 00:16:25,360
 But this guy, he had to catch these bats.

346
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:26,680
 That's pretty impressive as well.

347
00:16:26,680 --> 00:16:30,560
 If he, after running, lose his weight, drinking your own urine,

348
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:34,160
 still out of the car, now I'm going to catch these bats.

349
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:35,000
 Wow.

350
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,520
 And he just must have thought he was having a terrible race.

351
00:16:37,520 --> 00:16:39,160
 But he was, he might have thought he was winning.

352
00:16:39,160 --> 00:16:40,200
 Yeah, he's done.

353
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:42,600
 The other guy's up in here any minute.

354
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:46,680
 So anyway, he got a bit dispirited as you would after a few days.

355
00:16:46,680 --> 00:16:50,680
 And he wrote a note to his wife and he took a pen knife from his rucksack.

356
00:16:50,680 --> 00:16:53,880
 And he rucksack and he slits his wrists.

357
00:16:53,880 --> 00:16:59,600
 But he was so dehydrated that his blood, his blood thickened so much,

358
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:02,160
 it clotted the wound so he couldn't even kill himself.

359
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:03,720
 And then they eventually found him.

360
00:17:03,720 --> 00:17:06,720
 Well, you should have had as a rope or some sword.

361
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:07,720
 Some sort.

362
00:17:07,720 --> 00:17:10,880
 It's a bit of sword.

363
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:14,200
 I really like the story of when the modern Olympics came back,

364
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:17,000
 the very first marathon that was run.

365
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,840
 Because it was a big, it was a big, it was the, I guess,

366
00:17:19,840 --> 00:17:21,080
 big event for Greece.

367
00:17:21,080 --> 00:17:23,080
 The idea that that is what they would win.

368
00:17:23,080 --> 00:17:26,320
 The marathon, the marathon was so rooted in their culture.

369
00:17:26,320 --> 00:17:29,200
 And they already had been disappointed because they lost discus.

370
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:32,840
 They were furious because that should have been one of the events that they wanted.

371
00:17:32,840 --> 00:17:34,280
 I have a quick thing about that.

372
00:17:34,280 --> 00:17:40,720
 The guy who won the discus had never competed with one of their discuses before.

373
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:41,720
 He was an American.

374
00:17:41,720 --> 00:17:46,360
 And he had had to practice what made in America, which was extremely heavy.

375
00:17:46,360 --> 00:17:50,840
 And so he got to the real Olympics, completely fluffed his first two goals,

376
00:17:50,840 --> 00:17:53,640
 because he wasn't used to playing with this new discus.

377
00:17:53,640 --> 00:17:55,360
 And then through the winning shows.

378
00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:57,760
 By the way, you're throwing it like a frisbee as well.

379
00:17:57,760 --> 00:18:01,400
 Well, that might be what is the sport move.

380
00:18:01,400 --> 00:18:02,400
 The monkey crouch.

381
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:03,680
 Yeah.

382
00:18:03,680 --> 00:18:05,040
 Sorry, you were saying about the marathon.

383
00:18:05,040 --> 00:18:08,440
 No, so they've been sort of shamed in the discus.

384
00:18:08,440 --> 00:18:10,040
 They lost it to that man.

385
00:18:10,040 --> 00:18:12,520
 And so they desperately needed the win in the marathon.

386
00:18:12,520 --> 00:18:16,200
 So there were 17 people competing in the marathon.

387
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:20,600
 And they had good chances of winning as 13 of those athletes were from Greece.

388
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:23,040
 So that was pretty high odds.

389
00:18:23,040 --> 00:18:24,880
 But it's great, because very early audit the race.

390
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:25,800
 So it kind of shows you.

391
00:18:25,800 --> 00:18:29,640
 It shows you a different age of sportsmen as well when you hear these stories of how more,

392
00:18:29,640 --> 00:18:31,120
 kind of like they had the right stuff.

393
00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:32,640
 And there was more grit.

394
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:36,280
 So the early leader in the race was actually a Frenchman runner.

395
00:18:36,280 --> 00:18:40,240
 But he ended up pulling out of the race, because he got to exhaust.

396
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:44,720
 But mid race, while he was in the lead, he made a stop at a local inn

397
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:47,880
 to drink a glass of cognac from his future father-in-law.

398
00:18:47,880 --> 00:18:51,680
 So he had time to stop and have two drinks and then carry on.

399
00:18:51,680 --> 00:18:53,920
 But then he dropped out because of exhaustion.

400
00:18:53,920 --> 00:18:56,080
 So the guy who ended up winning was from Greece.

401
00:18:56,080 --> 00:18:58,280
 His name was Spirited and Louise.

402
00:18:58,280 --> 00:19:00,680
 He ran it in two hours and 58 minutes.

403
00:19:00,680 --> 00:19:05,880
 And what fueled him along the way, what his kind of choice of drinks, where he had wine,

404
00:19:05,880 --> 00:19:09,840
 milk, beer, some orange juice, and an Easter egg.

405
00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:10,840
 Brilliant.

406
00:19:10,840 --> 00:19:13,760
 Yeah, that's the winner of the first ever modern Olympic marathon.

407
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:14,760
 A Easter egg.

408
00:19:14,760 --> 00:19:15,760
 An Easter egg.

409
00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:18,520
 About the guy going into a pub, they used to do that in the Tour de France.

410
00:19:18,520 --> 00:19:23,880
 You know, that lake, whatever the tour would go by a pub or a bar.

411
00:19:23,880 --> 00:19:28,760
 The cyclists would just all get out and on mass run into the bar and just pilfer everything

412
00:19:28,760 --> 00:19:32,080
 they could get on the wine and all the beers and everything like that.

413
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:33,640
 And they would run out again and then go.

414
00:19:33,640 --> 00:19:38,080
 So all the people who ran bars and that went past the Tour de France thing, they would

415
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:41,800
 always close down the shutters and try and stop the cyclists from getting in.

416
00:19:41,800 --> 00:19:43,800
 It's always the French, isn't it?

417
00:19:43,800 --> 00:19:48,240
 Eric, as your dad, I've stopped halfway through a race for a glass of orange juice slash wine.

418
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:52,480
 Well, my dad's English, so no, but he stayed for a nice roast dinner.

419
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:55,640
 I love it as well.

420
00:19:55,640 --> 00:20:00,400
 The second and third place were won by Greece as well, but the third place winner got to qualify

421
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:04,240
 because he was later found to have covered part of the course in a carriage.

422
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:05,960
 In a carriage got a lift.

423
00:20:05,960 --> 00:20:06,960
 No one said it was against the rules.

424
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:07,960
 That's all I'm saying.

425
00:20:07,960 --> 00:20:08,960
 I think we should move on.

426
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:09,960
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

427
00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:14,400
 Before we do, Anne, have you got anything for us?

428
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:15,880
 Oh, I have got so much for you.

429
00:20:15,880 --> 00:20:16,880
 Oh, great.

430
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:22,880
 So the man, the swimmer who can change his own body temperature is called Lewis Pue, PUGH,

431
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:25,400
 so that's Pue, let's run with you.

432
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:29,440
 And he is the only person who has swam long distance in every ocean in the world, including

433
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:33,000
 the North Pole, which he did wearing goggles, speedos and a cap.

434
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:34,000
 Wow.

435
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,000
 That was all.

436
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:39,720
 And CNN, CNN, I've called him the human polar bear, so that's him.

437
00:20:39,720 --> 00:20:44,840
 But the marathon running mugs, they seem to be keeping records since 1885, makes it 129

438
00:20:44,840 --> 00:20:47,640
 years, 46 of them have done it since then.

439
00:20:47,640 --> 00:20:48,640
 Okay.

440
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:49,640
 Eating bats is not good for you.

441
00:20:49,640 --> 00:20:50,640
 They spread diseases.

442
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:53,880
 Guinea, actually a few weeks ago, have banned eating bats because they've got an Ebola

443
00:20:53,880 --> 00:20:58,760
 breakout and they're learning the bats for their 62 people, 62 people have died and they

444
00:20:58,760 --> 00:21:02,360
 eat them either in a peppery soup or they drive them out before a fire.

445
00:21:02,360 --> 00:21:06,720
 They advise not eating bats until the Ebola has gone away.

446
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:10,640
 In terms of eating strange things while you run, it's not quite Easter eggs, but a same

447
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:13,040
 bolt famously loves his chicken nuggets.

448
00:21:13,040 --> 00:21:16,920
 When he, on the day he won a gold medal in Beijing, they asked him how he did it and he said

449
00:21:16,920 --> 00:21:20,360
 he basically got up late, eight chicken nuggets went back to bed, eight more chicken nuggets

450
00:21:20,360 --> 00:21:21,360
 did the race.

451
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:22,360
 Such a show off.

452
00:21:22,360 --> 00:21:23,360
 Such a show off.

453
00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:24,360
 Got a world record.

454
00:21:24,360 --> 00:21:27,320
 Apparently you got through a thousand chicken nuggets over the Beijing Olympics, which

455
00:21:27,320 --> 00:21:30,320
 worked out 100 a day.

456
00:21:30,320 --> 00:21:34,400
 That's a marathon, that's like a marathon monk, but that's the equivalent of two actual

457
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:37,200
 chickens, which is pretty impressive.

458
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:38,440
 That has not been factored.

459
00:21:38,440 --> 00:21:49,920
 If you're listening to the man, that's for you.

460
00:21:49,920 --> 00:21:54,040
 Okay, on to fact number three and that is yours, James.

461
00:21:54,040 --> 00:21:59,880
 Okay, my fact this week is the Slovakian and Slovenian embassies in Washington meet once

462
00:21:59,880 --> 00:22:04,760
 a month to exchange wrongly-addressed mail.

463
00:22:04,760 --> 00:22:05,760
 That's fantastic.

464
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:06,760
 Isn't that great?

465
00:22:06,760 --> 00:22:13,960
 I just, this came from a website, SlovakRepublic.org, I think it seems to be pretty kosher.

466
00:22:13,960 --> 00:22:19,160
 This Slovak website, I've got a special section of the website saying, "We are not Slovenia."

467
00:22:19,160 --> 00:22:23,480
 They've got a load of examples.

468
00:22:23,480 --> 00:22:28,480
 Apparently, George W. Bush once said, "The only thing I know about Slovakia is what

469
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:33,400
 I learned first-hand from your foreign minister who came to Texas, and their foreign minister

470
00:22:33,400 --> 00:22:34,680
 had never been to Texas.

471
00:22:34,680 --> 00:22:37,840
 It was the Slovenian foreign minister who'd been there before."

472
00:22:37,840 --> 00:22:38,840
 Oh really?

473
00:22:38,840 --> 00:22:39,840
 It's difficult, George W.

474
00:22:39,840 --> 00:22:45,960
 It's not just him, Silvio Berlusconi introduced Slovenian Prime Minister Anton Rupp to the

475
00:22:45,960 --> 00:22:51,040
 crowd of journalists saying, "I'm very happy to be here today with the Prime Minister

476
00:22:51,040 --> 00:22:52,040
 of Slovakia."

477
00:22:52,040 --> 00:22:55,000
 It's very easily done.

478
00:22:55,000 --> 00:23:00,440
 It does happen for these countries that we find that we keep seeing examples of people

479
00:23:00,440 --> 00:23:08,080
 putting a minimum effort into actually working out who they are, remember that famous incident

480
00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:14,120
 with the National Anthem for Kazakhstan, up on the podium, this girl with one gold medal,

481
00:23:14,120 --> 00:23:17,280
 and then they play the Borat version.

482
00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:26,400
 The lyrics are in, "The lyrics are like we have the cleanest prostitutes in the region."

483
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:31,160
 Kazakhstan's prostitutes are the cleanest in the region, except, of course, for Turkmenistan.

484
00:23:31,160 --> 00:23:35,720
 Kazakhstan, Kazakhstan, you varied eyes place, come grasp the mighty penis of our leader from

485
00:23:35,720 --> 00:23:38,400
 junction with Testi's to Tipov at space.

486
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:40,760
 That's what she stood there for.

487
00:23:40,760 --> 00:23:46,040
 Going back to the Slovak thing, there was a Slovak cultural group in America, and they

488
00:23:46,040 --> 00:23:51,400
 had a big map of their country, and there was an old guy came in, and he was looking around

489
00:23:51,400 --> 00:23:55,960
 and they asked what he was doing, and he was trying to find his grandfather's village, because

490
00:23:55,960 --> 00:23:58,320
 his grandfather was from there.

491
00:23:58,320 --> 00:24:02,160
 But then his wife came over to him and she looked at the sign and said, "You're not Slovakia

492
00:24:02,160 --> 00:24:03,160
 Slovenian!"

493
00:24:03,160 --> 00:24:10,960
 Some of his guy got his whole life thinking of Slovakia, then he was actually Slovenian.

494
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:18,160
 If they don't know, how can you know, the rest of the world know?

495
00:24:18,160 --> 00:24:19,160
 That's great.

496
00:24:19,160 --> 00:24:24,640
 Yeah, I read about, there was a new couple, I think they just got married, and they wanted

497
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:29,320
 to get a flight to Sydney, and they bought the flight, and it was a lot cheaper than they

498
00:24:29,320 --> 00:24:30,320
 thought.

499
00:24:30,320 --> 00:24:37,720
 And when they got there, they found out that they'd actually gone to Sydney Nova Scotia by accident.

500
00:24:37,720 --> 00:24:41,000
 This is, unlike Jars, you're from Sydney, aren't you?

501
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:46,800
 Unlike Jars Sydney, this is a former mining town with a population of 26,083, and one of the

502
00:24:46,800 --> 00:24:48,680
 highest unemployment rates in Canada.

503
00:24:48,680 --> 00:24:51,480
 It does have a very nice opera house.

504
00:24:51,480 --> 00:24:59,960
 Well, this couple, they said, "Oh, we're just going to make the most of it," and they were

505
00:24:59,960 --> 00:25:04,320
 looking forward to looking at the pickup trucks and eating the local lobster.

506
00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:05,320
 Brilliant.

507
00:25:05,320 --> 00:25:06,320
 That's fantastic.

508
00:25:06,320 --> 00:25:08,240
 Yeah, that's a good opportunity.

509
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:09,240
 Yeah.

510
00:25:09,240 --> 00:25:13,360
 Okay, so I was looking at other mix-ups, and I saw a newspaper story.

511
00:25:13,360 --> 00:25:18,720
 The FDA in America was warning people not to mix up the prescription eyedrops called

512
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:24,240
 Juresol, with the acid-containing watt-remover Juresol.

513
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:29,520
 Apparently, these are two medicines with very similar names, and people have been putting

514
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:32,200
 this acid in their eyes, thinking it was eyedrops.

515
00:25:32,200 --> 00:25:33,200
 Oh, my God.

516
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:37,360
 And that got me to thinking if there's any other medicines with similar names and what could

517
00:25:37,360 --> 00:25:38,360
 happen.

518
00:25:38,360 --> 00:25:43,000
 I found a brilliant list online of commonly confused medicines.

519
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:47,640
 So there's a drug called Allegra, which is a drug often used for the temporary relief

520
00:25:47,640 --> 00:25:51,440
 of runny nose, and people keep getting that mixed up with Viagra.

521
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:52,440
 Ah.

522
00:25:52,440 --> 00:25:53,880
 That's their excuse.

523
00:25:53,880 --> 00:25:54,880
 Yeah.

524
00:25:54,880 --> 00:26:00,400
 But there's something that actually helps to cook carrots and potatoes.

525
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:01,920
 It's called Vegicil.

526
00:26:01,920 --> 00:26:06,960
 Some people confuse it.

527
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:09,240
 And there was another thing called Bino.

528
00:26:09,240 --> 00:26:12,480
 This was a company name, and it was an anti-gas thing.

529
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:16,320
 If you've got a bit of gas, you take this Bino, and it makes you feel better.

530
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:21,040
 But people were mistaking it for B&O, which is Beladonna and Opium.

531
00:26:21,040 --> 00:26:22,760
 Oh, wow.

532
00:26:22,760 --> 00:26:25,560
 And anything to add?

533
00:26:25,560 --> 00:26:28,240
 Just another Slovakia Slovenia.

534
00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:31,480
 They've basically got really similar flags as well, which doesn't help.

535
00:26:31,480 --> 00:26:33,880
 They've got a white blue red stripe with a shield on the front.

536
00:26:33,880 --> 00:26:36,440
 Shields are different, everything else is the same.

537
00:26:36,440 --> 00:26:40,840
 So Slovenia have done a contest to find a new flag, but I don't think they've adopted it

538
00:26:40,840 --> 00:26:43,240
 yet, which will distinguish them.

539
00:26:43,240 --> 00:26:47,320
 And then there's a professor from the University of...

540
00:26:47,320 --> 00:26:55,560
 The University of Libliyana, who said he reckons a problem with the confusion, is that Slovenia

541
00:26:55,560 --> 00:26:56,560
 hasn't got a brand.

542
00:26:56,560 --> 00:27:00,120
 Finland is Nokia and Sweden has like here, and they need their own brand.

543
00:27:00,120 --> 00:27:03,760
 But someone suggested Slovenia becomes the one-hour country, because you can get everywhere

544
00:27:03,760 --> 00:27:04,760
 within an hour.

545
00:27:04,760 --> 00:27:06,880
 It's very small.

546
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:12,120
 And then with the confusion as well, there was that thing at the London Olympics when the

547
00:27:12,120 --> 00:27:16,360
 North Korean women's football team walked off, because they showed the South Korean flag,

548
00:27:16,360 --> 00:27:18,360
 not the North Korean.

549
00:27:18,360 --> 00:27:19,880
 That's very embarrassing.

550
00:27:19,880 --> 00:27:24,040
 They did not go down well welcoming them with the wrong flag.

551
00:27:24,040 --> 00:27:27,440
 And just at the end, you're Bino, and there was a second Dennis Menis who made his debut

552
00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:28,840
 in America.

553
00:27:28,840 --> 00:27:34,400
 Of course, literally within five days of being debuted, yeah, the Americas, Dennis Menis,

554
00:27:34,400 --> 00:27:38,560
 and they had a very similar look, and they were done completely independently of each other.

555
00:27:38,560 --> 00:27:41,000
 It was like deep impact in Armageddon.

556
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:43,360
 I'm from Bonteno and Dante's peak.

557
00:27:43,360 --> 00:27:44,360
 Yep.

558
00:27:44,360 --> 00:27:46,360
 Any others?

559
00:27:46,360 --> 00:27:48,560
 Um, Genesis and Exodus.

560
00:27:48,560 --> 00:27:49,560
 The bands?

561
00:27:49,560 --> 00:27:50,560
 No.

562
00:27:50,560 --> 00:28:02,840
 So, let's move on to our final fact of the show, and we come on to Mr. Andy Murray.

563
00:28:02,840 --> 00:28:03,840
 Andy.

564
00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:04,840
 Okay.

565
00:28:04,840 --> 00:28:09,880
 My fact is, in the 18th century, there were genuine medsons called Alan's nipple liniment,

566
00:28:09,880 --> 00:28:16,080
 Grimston's eye snuff, Miller's worm plums, and Italian bussam friend.

567
00:28:16,080 --> 00:28:19,040
 Do you know what was in any of them, or...

568
00:28:19,040 --> 00:28:23,920
 Well, somebody said that Grimston's eye snuff was just pepper, just black pepper ground

569
00:28:23,920 --> 00:28:24,920
 up.

570
00:28:24,920 --> 00:28:31,760
 But a lot of patent medsons really consisted only of sort of 50% alcohol, so they were...

571
00:28:31,760 --> 00:28:36,800
 And a lot of them, we call them patent medsons, of course, all these fantastically named old

572
00:28:36,800 --> 00:28:38,800
 hamlin's wizard oil.

573
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:39,880
 Just, you know, beautifully named...

574
00:28:39,880 --> 00:28:40,880
 How I want that.

575
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:41,880
 Yeah.

576
00:28:41,880 --> 00:28:47,880
 Sugar plums for worms, aromatic lozen jizz of steel, cockings, coff lozen jizz, gingerbread

577
00:28:47,880 --> 00:28:48,880
 worm cakes.

578
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:52,720
 For some of them that did have active ingredients, there was one called Mrs. Winslow's soothing

579
00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:54,120
 syrup.

580
00:28:54,120 --> 00:29:01,080
 And that was a mainly a baby's and children, and it contained a full gram of morphine per ounce.

581
00:29:01,080 --> 00:29:03,640
 And cops' baby friend, that was another baby one.

582
00:29:03,640 --> 00:29:05,640
 Cops' baby friend.

583
00:29:05,640 --> 00:29:12,080
 And the label there boasted 8.5% alcohol and 1/8th grain sulfate of opium per ounce.

584
00:29:12,080 --> 00:29:15,080
 And that was marketed to help baby sleep.

585
00:29:15,080 --> 00:29:16,080
 Yeah.

586
00:29:16,080 --> 00:29:20,320
 You could buy heroin, couldn't you, in the first world war, to send to troops on the front

587
00:29:20,320 --> 00:29:21,320
 line?

588
00:29:21,320 --> 00:29:22,320
 Yeah.

589
00:29:22,320 --> 00:29:23,320
 But I didn't harrods, I think.

590
00:29:23,320 --> 00:29:24,320
 Really, I think so.

591
00:29:24,320 --> 00:29:25,320
 Still can, I think.

592
00:29:25,320 --> 00:29:26,320
 I'm not.

593
00:29:26,320 --> 00:29:27,320
 It's a count.

594
00:29:27,320 --> 00:29:28,320
 Yeah, but behind harrods.

595
00:29:28,320 --> 00:29:29,320
 We should fact.

596
00:29:29,320 --> 00:29:30,320
 (LAUGHTER)

597
00:29:30,320 --> 00:29:37,960
 Has anyone heard about, during the Middle Ages, when there was the Black Death, that Farts

598
00:29:37,960 --> 00:29:40,760
 in a jar was a thing that was prescribed for people?

599
00:29:40,760 --> 00:29:46,040
 Yeah, the idea was that if you conditioned the smell of something quite disgusting,

600
00:29:46,040 --> 00:29:49,680
 to your nose by the time, if there was an outbreak of Black Death around you, you would become

601
00:29:49,680 --> 00:29:53,320
 accustomed to that kind of smell, so it kind of made you immune to what was going to happen.

602
00:29:53,320 --> 00:29:56,400
 So you would go to the doctor, and they would give you a fart in a jar.

603
00:29:56,400 --> 00:30:00,440
 I don't know if it was your own fart, or if it was a pre-packaged fart, and you would

604
00:30:00,440 --> 00:30:01,440
 go home with it.

605
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:03,640
 And then you would rip open the lid, have a sniff.

606
00:30:03,640 --> 00:30:06,400
 In case of emergency brake glass.

607
00:30:06,400 --> 00:30:07,400
 (LAUGHTER)

608
00:30:07,400 --> 00:30:08,400
 Rake wind.

609
00:30:08,400 --> 00:30:09,400
 (LAUGHTER)

610
00:30:09,400 --> 00:30:10,400
 That's incredible.

611
00:30:10,400 --> 00:30:13,160
 What is that, like an early version of the vaccination idea?

612
00:30:13,160 --> 00:30:14,160
 Sort of.

613
00:30:14,160 --> 00:30:18,280
 Making small doses of a poison to build up a resistance, which is the Roman Emperor's

614
00:30:18,280 --> 00:30:19,280
 did.

615
00:30:19,280 --> 00:30:20,280
 Yes, exactly.

616
00:30:20,280 --> 00:30:21,280
 To build up the resistance.

617
00:30:21,280 --> 00:30:23,680
 You were not putting up a resistance to your own farts.

618
00:30:23,680 --> 00:30:27,920
 Well, it was fair enough, when I had, which I've been doing for years.

619
00:30:27,920 --> 00:30:34,280
 When I had my appendix taken out, they cut in testing by accident, and stomach acid

620
00:30:34,280 --> 00:30:37,280
 was pouring out, and I was digesting myself, right?

621
00:30:37,280 --> 00:30:41,640
 So I was in hospital for like three months, and you know, I wasn't allowed to eat anything,

622
00:30:41,640 --> 00:30:47,040
 so because I wasn't allowed to eat anything, because nothing worked, I also confirmed.

623
00:30:47,040 --> 00:30:52,320
 So there was gas trapped inside, and the nurses did say, "You're allowed to leave or eat

624
00:30:52,320 --> 00:30:57,880
 when you can fart," and it took me two months to essentially release any gas.

625
00:30:57,880 --> 00:31:04,720
 And when it came out, it was the worst thing I've ever, ever, ever, but what was also really

626
00:31:04,720 --> 00:31:08,920
 horrible was that I had to call the nurse to make a smell it.

627
00:31:08,920 --> 00:31:09,920
 (LAUGHTER)

628
00:31:09,920 --> 00:31:10,920
 Which is the opposite.

629
00:31:10,920 --> 00:31:13,520
 I have a feeling you didn't really have to call out.

630
00:31:13,520 --> 00:31:15,840
 She's probably already ringing your taxi.

631
00:31:15,840 --> 00:31:19,800
 She's probably got a matching story about the worst thing she's ever smelled, and he called

632
00:31:19,800 --> 00:31:23,120
 me in to smell it, it wasn't that.

633
00:31:23,120 --> 00:31:28,000
 The other cool thing about a lot of these medicines that I really like is that beyond all the

634
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:32,680
 kind of crazy names they had, some of them probably worked better than a lot of medical

635
00:31:32,680 --> 00:31:37,200
 alternatives, which were being touted by real doctors, I doctors with medical degrees

636
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:38,200
 at the time.

637
00:31:38,200 --> 00:31:39,200
 Right.

638
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:44,420
 And things like homeopathy, in the 18th century, homeopathy was your best bet, because all the

639
00:31:44,420 --> 00:31:48,560
 other medicines were more likely to kill you and likely to kill you quite fast.

640
00:31:48,560 --> 00:31:53,680
 So that, I think, has accounted for a lot of alternative and complementary medicines today,

641
00:31:53,680 --> 00:31:56,840
 still being popular, is that it had an initial lead.

642
00:31:56,840 --> 00:31:57,840
 Yeah.

643
00:31:57,840 --> 00:32:01,080
 They used to call them snake oil salesmen, they still do a little bit, don't they?

644
00:32:01,080 --> 00:32:02,080
 Yeah.

645
00:32:02,080 --> 00:32:05,120
 And I remember reading that actually snake oil is good for you.

646
00:32:05,120 --> 00:32:13,040
 If someone sold you some snake oil, it contains 20% of omega-3s, which is a thing that people

647
00:32:13,040 --> 00:32:17,120
 like to take, it's supposed to be good for your heart, and salmon, which is one thing that

648
00:32:17,120 --> 00:32:20,000
 people do take for omega-3 on the contains 18%.

649
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:22,160
 So actually snake oil would do you a bit of good?

650
00:32:22,160 --> 00:32:26,120
 I think it's all these medicines, it's trial and error.

651
00:32:26,120 --> 00:32:33,640
 So at the beginning of medicine time, you know, trying some honey with hedgehog hair, you

652
00:32:33,640 --> 00:32:34,640
 never know.

653
00:32:34,640 --> 00:32:35,640
 You'd be like, yeah, just try that.

654
00:32:35,640 --> 00:32:36,640
 Yeah.

655
00:32:36,640 --> 00:32:37,640
 For your eyes.

656
00:32:37,640 --> 00:32:38,640
 For your eyes, probably as well.

657
00:32:38,640 --> 00:32:43,640
 The last thing when you're in pain, you're a little bit delirious, and you'll turn to your

658
00:32:43,640 --> 00:32:47,440
 friend, your internet friend, just to go, what do I take?

659
00:32:47,440 --> 00:32:48,840
 And they'll just say, oh, yeah, just do that.

660
00:32:48,840 --> 00:32:49,840
 And you will do it.

661
00:32:49,840 --> 00:32:50,840
 Yeah.

662
00:32:50,840 --> 00:32:57,280
 There's a group of people in the Amazon who they like to put snakes down their trousers

663
00:32:57,280 --> 00:33:00,640
 to bite their penises, which gives them length and directions, and I wonder how they

664
00:33:00,640 --> 00:33:01,640
 found that out.

665
00:33:01,640 --> 00:33:07,040
 They're really just trying to cure their runny noses, that's what they claim.

666
00:33:07,040 --> 00:33:11,360
 I was reading a lot about placebo, in relation to, you know, this kind of medicine.

667
00:33:11,360 --> 00:33:12,360
 This is incredible.

668
00:33:12,360 --> 00:33:20,800
 There was a drug introduced in the 70s called Cymetadine, which cured 80% of stomach ulcers.

669
00:33:20,800 --> 00:33:25,480
 Now as time passed, it felt just 50% of stomach ulcers which it cured.

670
00:33:25,480 --> 00:33:30,200
 And this seems to have occurred after the introduction of renitadine, which is a competing

671
00:33:30,200 --> 00:33:33,160
 and it was supposedly a better, more effective drug.

672
00:33:33,160 --> 00:33:38,720
 So people think that the placebo effect of the initial drug stopped working because doctors

673
00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:44,000
 knew there was another supposedly better drug, and that's why the success rate fell.

674
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:48,240
 Because doctors have also been tested giving medicine to patients, and half of them have

675
00:33:48,240 --> 00:33:49,920
 said, I think this is a really good drug.

676
00:33:49,920 --> 00:33:51,000
 I'm very excited about it.

677
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:52,800
 It's shown really well in trials.

678
00:33:52,800 --> 00:33:56,800
 And half of them have said, I'm not sure about this, but take it anyway, see if it does

679
00:33:56,800 --> 00:34:02,520
 be good, patients have reported much less pain with the first sample adopted, same pill.

680
00:34:02,520 --> 00:34:03,520
 It's incredible.

681
00:34:03,520 --> 00:34:04,520
 Wow.

682
00:34:04,520 --> 00:34:05,520
 Yeah.

683
00:34:05,520 --> 00:34:07,480
 And placebo injections are more effective than placebo pills, because it's more dramatic

684
00:34:07,480 --> 00:34:08,480
 intervention.

685
00:34:08,480 --> 00:34:10,000
 It feels culturally people think that.

686
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:13,840
 I wonder if placebo works with all of these really weird things that they did in the

687
00:34:13,840 --> 00:34:16,240
 light, the middle ages and stuff like that.

688
00:34:16,240 --> 00:34:20,760
 So like, for instance, in the 14th century, one reason, one way that you could cure impotence

689
00:34:20,760 --> 00:34:24,320
 was to wear your trousers on your head for 24 hours.

690
00:34:24,320 --> 00:34:27,840
 It's hard to imagine the placebo effect work in that.

691
00:34:27,840 --> 00:34:31,160
 It's hard to imagine finding anyone who wants to have sex with you after you're on the

692
00:34:31,160 --> 00:34:33,080
 village all day with the trousers on your head.

693
00:34:33,080 --> 00:34:35,080
 Speak for yourself.

694
00:34:35,080 --> 00:34:36,960
 The placebo effect doesn't always work, though.

695
00:34:36,960 --> 00:34:41,720
 I was reading about Greek philosopher Heraclitus, who spent the last day of his life laying

696
00:34:41,720 --> 00:34:48,720
 the sun, covered in cow dung, convinced it would cure him, and it didn't work.

697
00:34:48,720 --> 00:34:56,760
 Curum of, from what, friendship?

698
00:34:56,760 --> 00:35:04,640
 Perfectly right, just to add that it was until 1916 that you could buy cocaine and heroin

699
00:35:04,640 --> 00:35:05,640
 at Harrods.

700
00:35:05,640 --> 00:35:09,840
 I thought this was a joke or not, but in the article it said, you could buy gift packs of

701
00:35:09,840 --> 00:35:11,640
 both the send to soldiers.

702
00:35:11,640 --> 00:35:12,640
 Yeah.

703
00:35:12,640 --> 00:35:13,640
 Wow.

704
00:35:13,640 --> 00:35:14,640
 That's true.

705
00:35:14,640 --> 00:35:15,640
 It was a very nice little Christmas gift.

706
00:35:15,640 --> 00:35:18,560
 I had fun when you were talking, watching the weirdest YouTube video I've ever seen

707
00:35:18,560 --> 00:35:21,320
 about how to bottle your farts, so thanks for that.

708
00:35:21,320 --> 00:35:26,120
 According to N-miniac, the way to do it is to do it while you're in the bath, because that's

709
00:35:26,120 --> 00:35:30,440
 how you can best direct said fart to jar, but what I quite like was he began his video by

710
00:35:30,440 --> 00:35:33,840
 washing out the jar before he put the farts in.

711
00:35:33,840 --> 00:35:36,000
 Oh, yeah, you don't want to get that jar dirty.

712
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:37,000
 Yeah.

713
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:41,000
 I just sort of quickly add that from the website that I got the farts in the jar from,

714
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:45,720
 there was a line at the bottom talking about, because it gave examples of how it was done

715
00:35:45,720 --> 00:35:46,720
 and so on.

716
00:35:46,720 --> 00:35:50,560
 It's sounds funny now, but the plague was no joke.

717
00:35:50,560 --> 00:36:05,240
 OK, that's it for another episode of No Such Thing as a Fish.

718
00:36:05,240 --> 00:36:06,240
 That's all of our facts.

719
00:36:06,240 --> 00:36:07,920
