WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.680
 We run it on QI a few years ago.

00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:02.200
 Yeah.

00:00:02.200 --> 00:00:04.360
 Um, which was, there's no such thing as a fish.

00:00:04.360 --> 00:00:05.680
 It ended up not such thing as a fish.

00:00:05.680 --> 00:00:09.680
 No, seriously, it's ended up the Oxford Dictionary of Underwater Life.

00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:11.520
 It says it right there, first paragraph.

00:00:11.520 --> 00:00:12.600
 No such thing as a fish.

00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:29.800
 Hello, and welcome to another episode of "No Such Thing"

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:33.400
 as a fish coming to you from the QI offices in Covert Garden.

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:34.480
 My name is Dan Treiber.

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:39.240
 I'm sitting here with three other QI elves, James Harkin, Andy Murray,

00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:41.800
 and on fact-checking Judy's this week, Ann Miller.

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:44.440
 And once again, we're going to go over our favorite facts

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:45.640
 from the last seven days.

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:48.760
 Joining us today, we have a special guest, a comedian

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:50.560
 and friend of ours, Eric Lamper.

00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:51.800
 Hello, how are you doing, mate?

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:52.600
 I'm very good, thanks.

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:54.760
 Eric is a good friend of ours.

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:55.880
 He's a comedian.

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:59.400
 He recently, as a stand-up, opened for Eddie Isard.

00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:01.240
 In French, it was a French gig.

00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:03.560
 And Eric did his set in French entirely.

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:05.560
 He's also going to star in an upcoming movie

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:07.240
 called Amstar Dam.

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:08.240
 Yeah, that's true.

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:10.520
 Yeah, I think it'll be here, I think.

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:11.480
 Oh, what's it about?

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:12.320
 So it's not bad.

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:14.520
 It's like a fairy tale world.

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:16.800
 It is a stoner film with that name.

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:18.440
 Yeah, I'm quite excited, you know.

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:20.000
 Based in Neverlands.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:21.880
 Yeah, so it's in Amsterdam, yeah.

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:24.240
 And I can't really reveal too much.

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:27.000
 I have a fact about Amsterdam to hear it.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.840
 I can't remember what year it was, it was about, I don't know,

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:30.840
 80 years or so ago.

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:33.840
 But there was a fog so bad that 29 people

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:38.200
 fell into the canals in a single night.

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:39.520
 That's fantastic.

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:41.520
 OK, let's start with fact number one.

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:43.920
 And we're going to start with our special guest, Eric.

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:46.320
 [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:50.480
 In 1923, Jockey Frank Hayes won a race in Belmont Park

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:53.640
 in New York, despite being dead.

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:54.160
 Wow.

00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:55.480
 OK, so explain that one.

00:01:55.480 --> 00:01:55.920
 Yeah.

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:57.840
 No, he started alive, right?

00:01:57.840 --> 00:01:58.920
 He started alive.

00:01:58.920 --> 00:01:59.840
 Oh.

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:01.120
 So he died mid-race?

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:02.800
 Mid-race, yeah.

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:04.280
 OK, give us more of the story.

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:07.800
 Well, basically, he suffered from a heart attack mid-race.

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:10.800
 But he was straddled nice and strong in the saddle.

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:12.280
 And the horse won.

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:15.080
 But how does-- is there a seat belt?

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:16.920
 Maybe he killed over, right?

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:19.120
 Yeah, but you're not going to move his chains, sort of like,

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:20.440
 slammed over, can I think.

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:23.240
 So he's got his feet nice and strapped in.

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:26.960
 And you've got your hands, as well, sort of tied around the--

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:27.960
 the reins.

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:28.960
 Oh, yeah.

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:31.080
 Did anyone notice during the race?

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:33.200
 It was the only discovered after he had won.

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:35.560
 He was probably the only one who was just kept running

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:37.600
 more and more laps.

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:40.280
 He's probably the only one not hitting the horse.

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:41.720
 Yeah, yes, still won.

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:43.480
 What does that say about cruelty?

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:45.560
 Yeah, listen, this horse-- am I right in saying

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:46.920
 it was called sweet kiss?

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:48.360
 Sweet, sweet kiss of death.

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:49.280
 Sweet kiss of death.

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:50.960
 That's what they nicknamed it afterwards.

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:51.280
 Is it?

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:51.800
 Yeah.

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:52.600
 Wow.

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:54.160
 This is an interesting link.

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:56.560
 Your dad, Eric, is a jockie, isn't he?

00:02:56.560 --> 00:02:58.440
 Yeah, I mean, that's one of the reasons why I thought.

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:01.320
 I mean, I only found out this fact this week.

00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:03.880
 But yeah, my dad is indeed a jockie.

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:06.080
 Because you're pretty tall, if you don't mind me saying.

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:12.200
 Yeah, and I've got big gums as well, which has never helped.

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:14.080
 As school they'd be like, oh, clearly your dad's

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:15.640
 had sex with a horse.

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:18.240
 It's all fair.

00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:19.800
 Unfortunately, I'm hung like a human.

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:23.200
 [LAUGHTER]

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:25.320
 You know the way that jockie's sit.

00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:28.280
 It's kind of like a crouched thing where they're leaning forward.

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:30.320
 Not the dead ones, the alive ones.

00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:32.440
 This is called the monkey crouch.

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:36.480
 And it was invented by a guy called Todd Sloan in 1897.

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:38.360
 And what's interesting about it is no one

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:40.560
 rode horses like that before in horse races.

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:43.120
 And when he invented that, horse race times and records

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:46.480
 improved by 5% to 7% in a single year.

00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:48.240
 So he just completely changed the spot

00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:50.520
 by deciding to crouch down on lean forward.

00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:51.520
 No one had ever done it before.

00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:52.520
 Wow, that's amazing.

00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:54.120
 That's like the, um, in the foes.

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:55.680
 Yeah, in high jump.

00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:56.480
 Yes.

00:03:56.480 --> 00:03:59.640
 I mean, that completely transformed the sport, didn't it?

00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:02.680
 We did a couple of years ago, the new way of throwing a javelin,

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:05.000
 which was invented very briefly in the 1930s,

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:08.840
 which is to hold it by one end, swing around, and let go.

00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:09.360
 The javelin.

00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:10.880
 Yeah, like throwing the hammer.

00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:15.840
 And it was banned almost immediately for obvious reasons.

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:18.640
 But it did provide amazingly long javelin throws.

00:04:18.640 --> 00:04:20.760
 In fact, to the extent that it could have been quite dangerous,

00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:23.040
 A, because it goes too far and might have spectators,

00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:27.640
 and B, because it's very hard to get it in exactly the right direction.

00:04:27.640 --> 00:04:30.160
 It's getting paled to say it's incredible.

00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:37.760
 A slight margin of error in the Paris Olympics in 1904, 1900.

00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:38.880
 Paris 1900, yeah.

00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:39.760
 Paris 1900.

00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:42.960
 People trained in the public parks, javelins.

00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:45.320
 And they had to be warm to be extra vigilant.

00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:49.160
 Some people trained at night, so there was less chance of hitting people.

00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:52.200
 But also more chance of hitting people.

00:04:52.200 --> 00:04:56.480
 The interesting thing about javelins is that they make them lesser or dynamic

00:04:56.480 --> 00:05:00.400
 as the time goes on, because the length of a running track

00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:02.520
 is always going to be about 100 meters.

00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:05.840
 And so what they do is they have to make sure the javelin can't be thrown more

00:05:05.840 --> 00:05:06.480
 than that.

00:05:06.480 --> 00:05:09.560
 People get stronger and stronger and better, and they get closer to 100 meters.

00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:13.280
 And then they always make the javelins a little bit worse so that people can't get that far.

00:05:13.280 --> 00:05:20.360
 By the end, it'll just be like a toothpick, not really a heavy toothpick.

00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:22.520
 Wow, OK, so what were you always out with at the--

00:05:22.520 --> 00:05:26.840
 I was 18 and 97 when he discovered that idea.

00:05:26.840 --> 00:05:28.360
 OK, that's amazing.

00:05:28.360 --> 00:05:33.160
 It's an interesting thing when you start looking into what people have achieved once they've

00:05:33.160 --> 00:05:34.560
 died.

00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:38.640
 There's a really one of my favorite stories from the Gnobel's world.

00:05:38.640 --> 00:05:41.200
 We've had Mark Abrams, the founder, on a few podcasts ago.

00:05:41.200 --> 00:05:46.280
 And he wrote a book years ago called The Gnobel Prizes 2, Why Chickens Prefer Beautiful Humans.

00:05:46.280 --> 00:05:52.440
 There's a fantastic story about a man called Laal Bahari, who in 1975, when he went to the bank

00:05:52.440 --> 00:05:58.480
 to apply for a loan, he discovered that he'd been declared dead by his uncle, who wanted

00:05:58.480 --> 00:06:02.800
 to declare him dead in order to get the land rights for the farm that he owned.

00:06:02.800 --> 00:06:09.040
 And he spent 19 years as a dead man trying to get recognized as a living man.

00:06:09.040 --> 00:06:10.680
 And it just no one would recognize him.

00:06:10.680 --> 00:06:14.320
 And he did incredible things like he stood for parliaments.

00:06:14.320 --> 00:06:18.080
 He tried to get arrested countless times because they arrested him technically, it meant

00:06:18.080 --> 00:06:19.320
 he was alive.

00:06:19.320 --> 00:06:20.320
 So they couldn't arrest him.

00:06:20.320 --> 00:06:21.320
 He would do all this stuff.

00:06:21.320 --> 00:06:23.440
 And they're like, we can't arrest you because you're dead.

00:06:23.440 --> 00:06:29.120
 And so for 19 years, he stayed dead technically and he finally got a court to overturn it.

00:06:29.120 --> 00:06:32.600
 And he set up in his town where he lived.

00:06:32.600 --> 00:06:38.400
 And I think for all of India, which is where he's from, a whole network and a group in support

00:06:38.400 --> 00:06:41.720
 of people who have been declared dead, who are in fact alive.

00:06:41.720 --> 00:06:43.840
 Oh, I'd love to have that power.

00:06:43.840 --> 00:06:45.240
 That's so amazing.

00:06:45.240 --> 00:06:49.000
 It's called the Association of Dead People that he created.

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:52.000
 And it was in 1994 that he was finally proven to be alive.

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:56.480
 It's a massive problem as well, in places where the paperwork often doesn't catch up with

00:06:56.480 --> 00:07:00.920
 people's actual legal status or whether or alive or not, that it happens a great deal.

00:07:00.920 --> 00:07:02.880
 It's why there's a need for an association, you know?

00:07:02.880 --> 00:07:03.880
 Was that in India?

00:07:03.880 --> 00:07:04.880
 Yes, it was.

00:07:04.880 --> 00:07:07.600
 Well, I do believe in reincarnation, that's why he was born again.

00:07:07.600 --> 00:07:08.600
 That's possible.

00:07:08.600 --> 00:07:13.960
 Well, let's go back to horse racing and jockey and stuff like that.

00:07:13.960 --> 00:07:20.280
 And there was a jockey, a very successful one called Lafitte, Pinque, Jr. And in order to

00:07:20.280 --> 00:07:25.520
 keep his weight down, he would take a single peanut, slice it into slivers and eat just half

00:07:25.520 --> 00:07:26.920
 of it for lunch.

00:07:26.920 --> 00:07:29.680
 The dieting for a jockey is actually mad.

00:07:29.680 --> 00:07:34.680
 So like me and my mum and my mum's French, so we'd eat like so much, we'd probably pick

00:07:34.680 --> 00:07:35.680
 out.

00:07:35.680 --> 00:07:38.880
 But he'd always eat salads and stuff.

00:07:38.880 --> 00:07:44.320
 And then I remember when we were in South Africa for one of his races and he carved himself

00:07:44.320 --> 00:07:46.200
 in black bin bags, right?

00:07:46.200 --> 00:07:49.200
 And just sell it taped all the way up to his neck.

00:07:49.200 --> 00:07:54.120
 And then he pushed a wheelbarrow full of things and he ran around with the wheelbarrow around

00:07:54.120 --> 00:07:55.680
 the field to lose the weight.

00:07:55.680 --> 00:08:01.200
 And then I remember he took off all the black bin bags and it just pulled out like a waterfall.

00:08:01.200 --> 00:08:02.200
 It was disgusting.

00:08:02.200 --> 00:08:03.200
 That's amazing.

00:08:03.200 --> 00:08:07.840
 I also read the people's speed walk, a jockey speed walk instead of run because they don't

00:08:07.840 --> 00:08:09.880
 want to put an extra muscle, don't know if that's good.

00:08:09.880 --> 00:08:10.880
 Muscle weight.

00:08:10.880 --> 00:08:11.880
 Muscle weight, yeah.

00:08:11.880 --> 00:08:12.880
 Muscle weight.

00:08:12.880 --> 00:08:13.880
 Muscle weight, yeah.

00:08:13.880 --> 00:08:14.880
 Is it AP McCoy?

00:08:14.880 --> 00:08:15.880
 Yeah.

00:08:15.880 --> 00:08:16.880
 He's one of the great jockeys of time.

00:08:16.880 --> 00:08:17.880
 Yeah, I lived near him.

00:08:17.880 --> 00:08:18.880
 Do you?

00:08:18.880 --> 00:08:19.880
 New market, yeah.

00:08:19.880 --> 00:08:23.320
 He has very intensive, almost-golding-hot baths.

00:08:23.320 --> 00:08:26.360
 Same reason I think, to sweat out so much of the water in his body.

00:08:26.360 --> 00:08:29.600
 He does it for a couple of hours, a couple of times a day before a race.

00:08:29.600 --> 00:08:30.600
 Yeah.

00:08:30.600 --> 00:08:35.400
 Like sometimes I'll commit a crime leader, police, just to see if they get away with it.

00:08:35.400 --> 00:08:37.520
 That's like two stones gone.

00:08:37.520 --> 00:08:41.080
 Okay, before we move on, Anne, have you got any facts you want to-

00:08:41.080 --> 00:08:42.080
 Yeah, I do.

00:08:42.080 --> 00:08:44.600
 James's Amsterdam fog was in 1893.

00:08:44.600 --> 00:08:48.280
 It was 79 people who fell into the canals that one night.

00:08:48.280 --> 00:08:51.320
 So what's where you're going in fog?

00:08:51.320 --> 00:08:56.920
 Frank Hayes, the New York Times, reckoned that he died just after his horse took lead

00:08:56.920 --> 00:08:58.280
 before he finished.

00:08:58.280 --> 00:09:05.760
 And they put it down to his heavy training regime, and his excitement coming first, which so-

00:09:05.760 --> 00:09:07.760
 Well, the horse is excitement.

00:09:07.760 --> 00:09:08.760
 Frank Hayes' excitement.

00:09:08.760 --> 00:09:09.760
 Oh, okay.

00:09:09.760 --> 00:09:12.560
 Have he been working so hard, and then he suddenly saw he was about to win, and that made

00:09:12.560 --> 00:09:13.560
 a big deal.

00:09:13.560 --> 00:09:14.560
 Well, it gave way.

00:09:14.560 --> 00:09:18.200
 There is a tumbler I found called Curious History, I haven't seen them before, but they

00:09:18.200 --> 00:09:22.760
 are probably one of the 20 best tumblers in the world, according to MSN, and they say

00:09:22.760 --> 00:09:27.200
 their spectators thought he was showing off and was riding one-handed, kind of like riding

00:09:27.200 --> 00:09:28.200
 a bike with no hands.

00:09:28.200 --> 00:09:33.280
 See, it's going over the line, and then when he realized he died till the race was over,

00:09:33.280 --> 00:09:37.720
 which the javelin spinning round technique, actually quite effective, the current world

00:09:37.720 --> 00:09:46.000
 record was 83 meters, and the guy who spun around threw 112, but was then disallowed, because

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:49.720
 yeah, didn't want the copycats, that was in 1966.

00:09:49.720 --> 00:09:52.320
 So the world record for javelin has been disqualified at the time?

00:09:52.320 --> 00:09:55.520
 Well, that one was because he did not want the world over your head.

00:09:55.520 --> 00:10:04.680
 I don't think anyone's got that far, but the thing is every time they change the javelin,

00:10:04.680 --> 00:10:08.560
 that invalidates all previous records, because you're not on a level playing field.

00:10:08.560 --> 00:10:13.360
 Yeah, the current record is with the current javelin is 98.48 meters, so still less than the

00:10:13.360 --> 00:10:14.880
 guy who spun over his head.

00:10:14.880 --> 00:10:15.880
 That's amazing.

00:10:15.880 --> 00:10:16.880
 So yeah, it's pretty good.

00:10:16.880 --> 00:10:17.880
 Good.

00:10:17.880 --> 00:10:18.880
 Factional Nuggets.

00:10:18.880 --> 00:10:28.000
 Okay, let's move on to fact number two.

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:33.880
 Fact number two is my fact, and that is that some Buddhist monks run marathons to achieve

00:10:33.880 --> 00:10:35.840
 enlightenment.

00:10:35.840 --> 00:10:42.480
 So this is a, I think, extraordinary endurance test.

00:10:42.480 --> 00:10:46.880
 Kind of seems like it's the greatest endurance test on our planet, which is done by these

00:10:46.880 --> 00:10:51.920
 monks who are known as the marathon monks, and these marathon monks achieve enlightenment

00:10:51.920 --> 00:10:57.400
 by going on these huge thousand day running challenges that go over the course of seven

00:10:57.400 --> 00:11:05.380
 years, and each year they have to do 100 days in one chunk of running a distance per day.

00:11:05.380 --> 00:11:10.440
 So 30 kilometers for the first 100 days, then they take a break, then they do another 100

00:11:10.440 --> 00:11:14.920
 days next year and year two, they do 30 kilometers again per day.

00:11:14.920 --> 00:11:19.800
 Number three, it's 30 kilometers again, and it's 30 for four, and then for five they do 200

00:11:19.800 --> 00:11:20.800
 day straight.

00:11:20.800 --> 00:11:25.760
 On year six it jumps up to 60 kilometers per day for 100 day straight, and then in year

00:11:25.760 --> 00:11:31.360
 seven it's 84 kilometers per day for 100 day straight, and then 30 kilometers additional

00:11:31.360 --> 00:11:33.280
 100 days after that.

00:11:33.280 --> 00:11:38.760
 And if at any point during this whole process they fail to reach the number that they're

00:11:38.760 --> 00:11:42.120
 meant to reach on that target, they kill themselves.

00:11:42.120 --> 00:11:47.720
 And only 46 people in the hundred years or so that this has been going on had successfully

00:11:47.720 --> 00:11:48.720
 completed it.

00:11:48.720 --> 00:11:51.840
 So they kill themselves if they haven't already died in the meantime.

00:11:51.840 --> 00:11:52.840
 Exactly.

00:11:52.840 --> 00:11:56.360
 But if they sort of if they run short by a couple of kilometers, they carry, they dress

00:11:56.360 --> 00:12:00.000
 in white because the white is the symbol of the color of death.

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:01.720
 So they're dressed for death.

00:12:01.720 --> 00:12:04.160
 They bring a sword and a rope.

00:12:04.160 --> 00:12:05.160
 So they can either.

00:12:05.160 --> 00:12:06.160
 Sounds a lot.

00:12:06.160 --> 00:12:07.160
 A couple of camera.

00:12:07.160 --> 00:12:11.320
 Are you sure you've got your packs right?

00:12:11.320 --> 00:12:16.760
 Yeah, so they have the option of hanging themselves or of stabbing themselves.

00:12:16.760 --> 00:12:19.200
 I think they may not still kill themselves.

00:12:19.200 --> 00:12:23.800
 I think they haven't since the since the 19th century, I think it's been officially a bit

00:12:23.800 --> 00:12:24.800
 discouraged.

00:12:24.800 --> 00:12:25.800
 Yeah, yeah, it's been.

00:12:25.800 --> 00:12:26.800
 That's true.

00:12:26.800 --> 00:12:27.800
 The original hard.

00:12:27.800 --> 00:12:33.240
 I mean, there is an area near the mountain where these monks live in Japan, which is called

00:12:33.240 --> 00:12:34.320
 the mountain high.

00:12:34.320 --> 00:12:38.880
 I don't know how to pronounce that properly, it's H-I-E-I, and it's littered with unmarked

00:12:38.880 --> 00:12:44.640
 graves from the people pre-19th century monks who did not manage to finish and complete

00:12:44.640 --> 00:12:46.960
 it and had to kill themselves as a result.

00:12:46.960 --> 00:12:50.200
 But the idea is that if you do complete it, you get a medal.

00:12:50.200 --> 00:12:54.360
 You get a nice little medal, you get to get it back and those flowers and they still will

00:12:54.360 --> 00:12:57.720
 blanket around you for when you finish it.

00:12:57.720 --> 00:13:01.960
 Well, actually, you say silver blanket, but one thing that I found out about monks is

00:13:01.960 --> 00:13:08.560
 that they have a technique where they can heat themselves up.

00:13:08.560 --> 00:13:13.440
 So it's a yoga technique called tummo, and they can enter like a deep meditation, and

00:13:13.440 --> 00:13:21.720
 if there's a few monks around each other, and they can have like cold blankets on them,

00:13:21.720 --> 00:13:24.160
 and they can heat those blankets in a cold room.

00:13:24.160 --> 00:13:25.160
 Wow.

00:13:25.160 --> 00:13:26.160
 And other people would die.

00:13:26.160 --> 00:13:31.720
 There have been experiments on those guys who had wet blankets put on them, and they

00:13:31.720 --> 00:13:35.840
 started steaming until they were completely dry.

00:13:35.840 --> 00:13:40.360
 There isn't an endurance swimmer who we've covered on QI on TV, and he is able to raise

00:13:40.360 --> 00:13:45.840
 his body temperature by up to one or two degrees, because he swims in very icy water.

00:13:45.840 --> 00:13:49.760
 And I wrote to him and asked, is this true, and one of his representatives wrote back and

00:13:49.760 --> 00:13:51.760
 said, "Yep, that's what he does."

00:13:51.760 --> 00:13:54.320
 Let's go back to crazy monks.

00:13:54.320 --> 00:13:55.320
 Yes, yeah.

00:13:55.320 --> 00:13:56.320
 Let's do that.

00:13:56.320 --> 00:13:59.600
 I'll tell you one more thing about the marathon monks just to bring us back in, which is

00:13:59.600 --> 00:14:05.680
 that so 46 people only have ever completed this course.

00:14:05.680 --> 00:14:09.680
 I think I've got the number wrong, and it would be great to know when this practice started,

00:14:09.680 --> 00:14:14.840
 because I think it's either 100 years ago, 400 years ago, or 1000 years ago.

00:14:14.840 --> 00:14:19.200
 But 46 people have completed it.

00:14:19.200 --> 00:14:20.840
 One guy did it twice.

00:14:20.840 --> 00:14:21.840
 Yeah.

00:14:21.840 --> 00:14:24.640
 He's super enlightened.

00:14:24.640 --> 00:14:25.640
 Yeah.

00:14:25.640 --> 00:14:27.360
 How many marathons has Eddie is up there?

00:14:27.360 --> 00:14:28.360
 Yeah, quite a lot.

00:14:28.360 --> 00:14:30.360
 No, did he do six days?

00:14:30.360 --> 00:14:35.040
 Yeah, Eddie did 43 marathons in 51 days in 2009.

00:14:35.040 --> 00:14:40.680
 Also, his marathons were presumably a lot shorter, I'm guessing.

00:14:40.680 --> 00:14:43.400
 No, I marathon is always the same distance, no?

00:14:43.400 --> 00:14:45.920
 Although, they're not always the same distance.

00:14:45.920 --> 00:14:51.680
 The original distance run after the Battle of Marathon was, I think, about 22 miles.

00:14:51.680 --> 00:14:54.280
 It wasn't any more than 25, either.

00:14:54.280 --> 00:14:55.680
 And there was a lot of early flux.

00:14:55.680 --> 00:15:02.200
 But wasn't the first marathon by this guy that had to run from Argos to, like, somewhere else,

00:15:02.200 --> 00:15:04.200
 because he was reporting on a battle.

00:15:04.200 --> 00:15:05.200
 Oh, OK, the battle I was.

00:15:05.200 --> 00:15:06.200
 There had been one.

00:15:06.200 --> 00:15:07.600
 It wasn't that we've lost the battle.

00:15:07.600 --> 00:15:09.880
 You need to flee immediately, I was, hey, we won, guys.

00:15:09.880 --> 00:15:12.400
 OK, right, so it was the Battle of Marathon.

00:15:12.400 --> 00:15:13.400
 That's it.

00:15:13.400 --> 00:15:15.240
 It wasn't actually called that one marathon, yeah.

00:15:15.240 --> 00:15:16.240
 Yeah, it was that one.

00:15:16.240 --> 00:15:20.320
 There is a really interesting thing about the official modern marathon length,

00:15:20.320 --> 00:15:24.440
 which is that it's 26 miles and 385 yards.

00:15:24.440 --> 00:15:28.080
 And it was only, it's only been the case since 1908.

00:15:28.080 --> 00:15:30.880
 And it was done to please the British royal family.

00:15:30.880 --> 00:15:34.640
 Because Queen Alexandra wanted the race to start on the lawn at Windsor Castle,

00:15:34.640 --> 00:15:37.560
 so that her children could watch from the nursery window.

00:15:37.560 --> 00:15:39.200
 And then an extra mile was added to the race.

00:15:39.200 --> 00:15:42.760
 And then, at the end of the race, 385 yards were added, so that it could finish

00:15:42.760 --> 00:15:46.480
 in front of the royal box at the Olympic Stadium in White City.

00:15:46.480 --> 00:15:51.160
 So it's all been done an extra mile and 385 yards.

00:15:51.160 --> 00:15:53.000
 At the Royal Wim.

00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:55.240
 Here's the thing about crazy marathon.

00:15:55.240 --> 00:15:58.280
 So as a Italian athlete called Maro Prosperi.

00:15:58.280 --> 00:16:03.120
 And in 1994, he was running a marathon in the Moroccan Sahara.

00:16:03.120 --> 00:16:04.760
 But he got lost.

00:16:04.760 --> 00:16:11.920
 And when they found him nine days later, he'd run 200 kilometers off course into Algeria.

00:16:11.920 --> 00:16:15.880
 He'd lost 18 kilograms and only survived by drinking his own urine

00:16:15.880 --> 00:16:19.440
 and eating bats that he found in an abandoned mosque.

00:16:19.440 --> 00:16:21.760
 Wow.

00:16:21.760 --> 00:16:25.360
 But this guy, he had to catch these bats.

00:16:25.360 --> 00:16:26.680
 That's pretty impressive as well.

00:16:26.680 --> 00:16:30.560
 If he, after running, lose his weight, drinking your own urine,

00:16:30.560 --> 00:16:34.160
 still out of the car, now I'm going to catch these bats.

00:16:34.160 --> 00:16:35.000
 Wow.

00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:37.520
 And he just must have thought he was having a terrible race.

00:16:37.520 --> 00:16:39.160
 But he was, he might have thought he was winning.

00:16:39.160 --> 00:16:40.200
 Yeah, he's done.

00:16:40.200 --> 00:16:42.600
 The other guy's up in here any minute.

00:16:42.600 --> 00:16:46.680
 So anyway, he got a bit dispirited as you would after a few days.

00:16:46.680 --> 00:16:50.680
 And he wrote a note to his wife and he took a pen knife from his rucksack.

00:16:50.680 --> 00:16:53.880
 And he rucksack and he slits his wrists.

00:16:53.880 --> 00:16:59.600
 But he was so dehydrated that his blood, his blood thickened so much,

00:16:59.600 --> 00:17:02.160
 it clotted the wound so he couldn't even kill himself.

00:17:02.160 --> 00:17:03.720
 And then they eventually found him.

00:17:03.720 --> 00:17:06.720
 Well, you should have had as a rope or some sword.

00:17:06.720 --> 00:17:07.720
 Some sort.

00:17:07.720 --> 00:17:10.880
 It's a bit of sword.

00:17:10.880 --> 00:17:14.200
 I really like the story of when the modern Olympics came back,

00:17:14.200 --> 00:17:17.000
 the very first marathon that was run.

00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:19.840
 Because it was a big, it was a big, it was the, I guess,

00:17:19.840 --> 00:17:21.080
 big event for Greece.

00:17:21.080 --> 00:17:23.080
 The idea that that is what they would win.

00:17:23.080 --> 00:17:26.320
 The marathon, the marathon was so rooted in their culture.

00:17:26.320 --> 00:17:29.200
 And they already had been disappointed because they lost discus.

00:17:29.200 --> 00:17:32.840
 They were furious because that should have been one of the events that they wanted.

00:17:32.840 --> 00:17:34.280
 I have a quick thing about that.

00:17:34.280 --> 00:17:40.720
 The guy who won the discus had never competed with one of their discuses before.

00:17:40.720 --> 00:17:41.720
 He was an American.

00:17:41.720 --> 00:17:46.360
 And he had had to practice what made in America, which was extremely heavy.

00:17:46.360 --> 00:17:50.840
 And so he got to the real Olympics, completely fluffed his first two goals,

00:17:50.840 --> 00:17:53.640
 because he wasn't used to playing with this new discus.

00:17:53.640 --> 00:17:55.360
 And then through the winning shows.

00:17:55.360 --> 00:17:57.760
 By the way, you're throwing it like a frisbee as well.

00:17:57.760 --> 00:18:01.400
 Well, that might be what is the sport move.

00:18:01.400 --> 00:18:02.400
 The monkey crouch.

00:18:02.400 --> 00:18:03.680
 Yeah.

00:18:03.680 --> 00:18:05.040
 Sorry, you were saying about the marathon.

00:18:05.040 --> 00:18:08.440
 No, so they've been sort of shamed in the discus.

00:18:08.440 --> 00:18:10.040
 They lost it to that man.

00:18:10.040 --> 00:18:12.520
 And so they desperately needed the win in the marathon.

00:18:12.520 --> 00:18:16.200
 So there were 17 people competing in the marathon.

00:18:16.200 --> 00:18:20.600
 And they had good chances of winning as 13 of those athletes were from Greece.

00:18:20.600 --> 00:18:23.040
 So that was pretty high odds.

00:18:23.040 --> 00:18:24.880
 But it's great, because very early audit the race.

00:18:24.880 --> 00:18:25.800
 So it kind of shows you.

00:18:25.800 --> 00:18:29.640
 It shows you a different age of sportsmen as well when you hear these stories of how more,

00:18:29.640 --> 00:18:31.120
 kind of like they had the right stuff.

00:18:31.120 --> 00:18:32.640
 And there was more grit.

00:18:32.640 --> 00:18:36.280
 So the early leader in the race was actually a Frenchman runner.

00:18:36.280 --> 00:18:40.240
 But he ended up pulling out of the race, because he got to exhaust.

00:18:40.240 --> 00:18:44.720
 But mid race, while he was in the lead, he made a stop at a local inn

00:18:44.720 --> 00:18:47.880
 to drink a glass of cognac from his future father-in-law.

00:18:47.880 --> 00:18:51.680
 So he had time to stop and have two drinks and then carry on.

00:18:51.680 --> 00:18:53.920
 But then he dropped out because of exhaustion.

00:18:53.920 --> 00:18:56.080
 So the guy who ended up winning was from Greece.

00:18:56.080 --> 00:18:58.280
 His name was Spirited and Louise.

00:18:58.280 --> 00:19:00.680
 He ran it in two hours and 58 minutes.

00:19:00.680 --> 00:19:05.880
 And what fueled him along the way, what his kind of choice of drinks, where he had wine,

00:19:05.880 --> 00:19:09.840
 milk, beer, some orange juice, and an Easter egg.

00:19:09.840 --> 00:19:10.840
 Brilliant.

00:19:10.840 --> 00:19:13.760
 Yeah, that's the winner of the first ever modern Olympic marathon.

00:19:13.760 --> 00:19:14.760
 A Easter egg.

00:19:14.760 --> 00:19:15.760
 An Easter egg.

00:19:15.760 --> 00:19:18.520
 About the guy going into a pub, they used to do that in the Tour de France.

00:19:18.520 --> 00:19:23.880
 You know, that lake, whatever the tour would go by a pub or a bar.

00:19:23.880 --> 00:19:28.760
 The cyclists would just all get out and on mass run into the bar and just pilfer everything

00:19:28.760 --> 00:19:32.080
 they could get on the wine and all the beers and everything like that.

00:19:32.080 --> 00:19:33.640
 And they would run out again and then go.

00:19:33.640 --> 00:19:38.080
 So all the people who ran bars and that went past the Tour de France thing, they would

00:19:38.080 --> 00:19:41.800
 always close down the shutters and try and stop the cyclists from getting in.

00:19:41.800 --> 00:19:43.800
 It's always the French, isn't it?

00:19:43.800 --> 00:19:48.240
 Eric, as your dad, I've stopped halfway through a race for a glass of orange juice slash wine.

00:19:48.240 --> 00:19:52.480
 Well, my dad's English, so no, but he stayed for a nice roast dinner.

00:19:52.480 --> 00:19:55.640
 I love it as well.

00:19:55.640 --> 00:20:00.400
 The second and third place were won by Greece as well, but the third place winner got to qualify

00:20:00.400 --> 00:20:04.240
 because he was later found to have covered part of the course in a carriage.

00:20:04.240 --> 00:20:05.960
 In a carriage got a lift.

00:20:05.960 --> 00:20:06.960
 No one said it was against the rules.

00:20:06.960 --> 00:20:07.960
 That's all I'm saying.

00:20:07.960 --> 00:20:08.960
 I think we should move on.

00:20:08.960 --> 00:20:09.960
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:20:09.960 --> 00:20:14.400
 Before we do, Anne, have you got anything for us?

00:20:14.400 --> 00:20:15.880
 Oh, I have got so much for you.

00:20:15.880 --> 00:20:16.880
 Oh, great.

00:20:16.880 --> 00:20:22.880
 So the man, the swimmer who can change his own body temperature is called Lewis Pue, PUGH,

00:20:22.880 --> 00:20:25.400
 so that's Pue, let's run with you.

00:20:25.400 --> 00:20:29.440
 And he is the only person who has swam long distance in every ocean in the world, including

00:20:29.440 --> 00:20:33.000
 the North Pole, which he did wearing goggles, speedos and a cap.

00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:34.000
 Wow.

00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:35.000
 That was all.

00:20:35.000 --> 00:20:39.720
 And CNN, CNN, I've called him the human polar bear, so that's him.

00:20:39.720 --> 00:20:44.840
 But the marathon running mugs, they seem to be keeping records since 1885, makes it 129

00:20:44.840 --> 00:20:47.640
 years, 46 of them have done it since then.

00:20:47.640 --> 00:20:48.640
 Okay.

00:20:48.640 --> 00:20:49.640
 Eating bats is not good for you.

00:20:49.640 --> 00:20:50.640
 They spread diseases.

00:20:50.640 --> 00:20:53.880
 Guinea, actually a few weeks ago, have banned eating bats because they've got an Ebola

00:20:53.880 --> 00:20:58.760
 breakout and they're learning the bats for their 62 people, 62 people have died and they

00:20:58.760 --> 00:21:02.360
 eat them either in a peppery soup or they drive them out before a fire.

00:21:02.360 --> 00:21:06.720
 They advise not eating bats until the Ebola has gone away.

00:21:06.720 --> 00:21:10.640
 In terms of eating strange things while you run, it's not quite Easter eggs, but a same

00:21:10.640 --> 00:21:13.040
 bolt famously loves his chicken nuggets.

00:21:13.040 --> 00:21:16.920
 When he, on the day he won a gold medal in Beijing, they asked him how he did it and he said

00:21:16.920 --> 00:21:20.360
 he basically got up late, eight chicken nuggets went back to bed, eight more chicken nuggets

00:21:20.360 --> 00:21:21.360
 did the race.

00:21:21.360 --> 00:21:22.360
 Such a show off.

00:21:22.360 --> 00:21:23.360
 Such a show off.

00:21:23.360 --> 00:21:24.360
 Got a world record.

00:21:24.360 --> 00:21:27.320
 Apparently you got through a thousand chicken nuggets over the Beijing Olympics, which

00:21:27.320 --> 00:21:30.320
 worked out 100 a day.

00:21:30.320 --> 00:21:34.400
 That's a marathon, that's like a marathon monk, but that's the equivalent of two actual

00:21:34.400 --> 00:21:37.200
 chickens, which is pretty impressive.

00:21:37.200 --> 00:21:38.440
 That has not been factored.

00:21:38.440 --> 00:21:49.920
 If you're listening to the man, that's for you.

00:21:49.920 --> 00:21:54.040
 Okay, on to fact number three and that is yours, James.

00:21:54.040 --> 00:21:59.880
 Okay, my fact this week is the Slovakian and Slovenian embassies in Washington meet once

00:21:59.880 --> 00:22:04.760
 a month to exchange wrongly-addressed mail.

00:22:04.760 --> 00:22:05.760
 That's fantastic.

00:22:05.760 --> 00:22:06.760
 Isn't that great?

00:22:06.760 --> 00:22:13.960
 I just, this came from a website, SlovakRepublic.org, I think it seems to be pretty kosher.

00:22:13.960 --> 00:22:19.160
 This Slovak website, I've got a special section of the website saying, "We are not Slovenia."

00:22:19.160 --> 00:22:23.480
 They've got a load of examples.

00:22:23.480 --> 00:22:28.480
 Apparently, George W. Bush once said, "The only thing I know about Slovakia is what

00:22:28.480 --> 00:22:33.400
 I learned first-hand from your foreign minister who came to Texas, and their foreign minister

00:22:33.400 --> 00:22:34.680
 had never been to Texas.

00:22:34.680 --> 00:22:37.840
 It was the Slovenian foreign minister who'd been there before."

00:22:37.840 --> 00:22:38.840
 Oh really?

00:22:38.840 --> 00:22:39.840
 It's difficult, George W.

00:22:39.840 --> 00:22:45.960
 It's not just him, Silvio Berlusconi introduced Slovenian Prime Minister Anton Rupp to the

00:22:45.960 --> 00:22:51.040
 crowd of journalists saying, "I'm very happy to be here today with the Prime Minister

00:22:51.040 --> 00:22:52.040
 of Slovakia."

00:22:52.040 --> 00:22:55.000
 It's very easily done.

00:22:55.000 --> 00:23:00.440
 It does happen for these countries that we find that we keep seeing examples of people

00:23:00.440 --> 00:23:08.080
 putting a minimum effort into actually working out who they are, remember that famous incident

00:23:08.080 --> 00:23:14.120
 with the National Anthem for Kazakhstan, up on the podium, this girl with one gold medal,

00:23:14.120 --> 00:23:17.280
 and then they play the Borat version.

00:23:17.280 --> 00:23:26.400
 The lyrics are in, "The lyrics are like we have the cleanest prostitutes in the region."

00:23:26.400 --> 00:23:31.160
 Kazakhstan's prostitutes are the cleanest in the region, except, of course, for Turkmenistan.

00:23:31.160 --> 00:23:35.720
 Kazakhstan, Kazakhstan, you varied eyes place, come grasp the mighty penis of our leader from

00:23:35.720 --> 00:23:38.400
 junction with Testi's to Tipov at space.

00:23:38.400 --> 00:23:40.760
 That's what she stood there for.

00:23:40.760 --> 00:23:46.040
 Going back to the Slovak thing, there was a Slovak cultural group in America, and they

00:23:46.040 --> 00:23:51.400
 had a big map of their country, and there was an old guy came in, and he was looking around

00:23:51.400 --> 00:23:55.960
 and they asked what he was doing, and he was trying to find his grandfather's village, because

00:23:55.960 --> 00:23:58.320
 his grandfather was from there.

00:23:58.320 --> 00:24:02.160
 But then his wife came over to him and she looked at the sign and said, "You're not Slovakia

00:24:02.160 --> 00:24:03.160
 Slovenian!"

00:24:03.160 --> 00:24:10.960
 Some of his guy got his whole life thinking of Slovakia, then he was actually Slovenian.

00:24:10.960 --> 00:24:18.160
 If they don't know, how can you know, the rest of the world know?

00:24:18.160 --> 00:24:19.160
 That's great.

00:24:19.160 --> 00:24:24.640
 Yeah, I read about, there was a new couple, I think they just got married, and they wanted

00:24:24.640 --> 00:24:29.320
 to get a flight to Sydney, and they bought the flight, and it was a lot cheaper than they

00:24:29.320 --> 00:24:30.320
 thought.

00:24:30.320 --> 00:24:37.720
 And when they got there, they found out that they'd actually gone to Sydney Nova Scotia by accident.

00:24:37.720 --> 00:24:41.000
 This is, unlike Jars, you're from Sydney, aren't you?

00:24:41.000 --> 00:24:46.800
 Unlike Jars Sydney, this is a former mining town with a population of 26,083, and one of the

00:24:46.800 --> 00:24:48.680
 highest unemployment rates in Canada.

00:24:48.680 --> 00:24:51.480
 It does have a very nice opera house.

00:24:51.480 --> 00:24:59.960
 Well, this couple, they said, "Oh, we're just going to make the most of it," and they were

00:24:59.960 --> 00:25:04.320
 looking forward to looking at the pickup trucks and eating the local lobster.

00:25:04.320 --> 00:25:05.320
 Brilliant.

00:25:05.320 --> 00:25:06.320
 That's fantastic.

00:25:06.320 --> 00:25:08.240
 Yeah, that's a good opportunity.

00:25:08.240 --> 00:25:09.240
 Yeah.

00:25:09.240 --> 00:25:13.360
 Okay, so I was looking at other mix-ups, and I saw a newspaper story.

00:25:13.360 --> 00:25:18.720
 The FDA in America was warning people not to mix up the prescription eyedrops called

00:25:18.720 --> 00:25:24.240
 Juresol, with the acid-containing watt-remover Juresol.

00:25:24.240 --> 00:25:29.520
 Apparently, these are two medicines with very similar names, and people have been putting

00:25:29.520 --> 00:25:32.200
 this acid in their eyes, thinking it was eyedrops.

00:25:32.200 --> 00:25:33.200
 Oh, my God.

00:25:33.200 --> 00:25:37.360
 And that got me to thinking if there's any other medicines with similar names and what could

00:25:37.360 --> 00:25:38.360
 happen.

00:25:38.360 --> 00:25:43.000
 I found a brilliant list online of commonly confused medicines.

00:25:43.000 --> 00:25:47.640
 So there's a drug called Allegra, which is a drug often used for the temporary relief

00:25:47.640 --> 00:25:51.440
 of runny nose, and people keep getting that mixed up with Viagra.

00:25:51.440 --> 00:25:52.440
 Ah.

00:25:52.440 --> 00:25:53.880
 That's their excuse.

00:25:53.880 --> 00:25:54.880
 Yeah.

00:25:54.880 --> 00:26:00.400
 But there's something that actually helps to cook carrots and potatoes.

00:26:00.400 --> 00:26:01.920
 It's called Vegicil.

00:26:01.920 --> 00:26:06.960
 Some people confuse it.

00:26:06.960 --> 00:26:09.240
 And there was another thing called Bino.

00:26:09.240 --> 00:26:12.480
 This was a company name, and it was an anti-gas thing.

00:26:12.480 --> 00:26:16.320
 If you've got a bit of gas, you take this Bino, and it makes you feel better.

00:26:16.320 --> 00:26:21.040
 But people were mistaking it for B&O, which is Beladonna and Opium.

00:26:21.040 --> 00:26:22.760
 Oh, wow.

00:26:22.760 --> 00:26:25.560
 And anything to add?

00:26:25.560 --> 00:26:28.240
 Just another Slovakia Slovenia.

00:26:28.240 --> 00:26:31.480
 They've basically got really similar flags as well, which doesn't help.

00:26:31.480 --> 00:26:33.880
 They've got a white blue red stripe with a shield on the front.

00:26:33.880 --> 00:26:36.440
 Shields are different, everything else is the same.

00:26:36.440 --> 00:26:40.840
 So Slovenia have done a contest to find a new flag, but I don't think they've adopted it

00:26:40.840 --> 00:26:43.240
 yet, which will distinguish them.

00:26:43.240 --> 00:26:47.320
 And then there's a professor from the University of...

00:26:47.320 --> 00:26:55.560
 The University of Libliyana, who said he reckons a problem with the confusion, is that Slovenia

00:26:55.560 --> 00:26:56.560
 hasn't got a brand.

00:26:56.560 --> 00:27:00.120
 Finland is Nokia and Sweden has like here, and they need their own brand.

00:27:00.120 --> 00:27:03.760
 But someone suggested Slovenia becomes the one-hour country, because you can get everywhere

00:27:03.760 --> 00:27:04.760
 within an hour.

00:27:04.760 --> 00:27:06.880
 It's very small.

00:27:06.880 --> 00:27:12.120
 And then with the confusion as well, there was that thing at the London Olympics when the

00:27:12.120 --> 00:27:16.360
 North Korean women's football team walked off, because they showed the South Korean flag,

00:27:16.360 --> 00:27:18.360
 not the North Korean.

00:27:18.360 --> 00:27:19.880
 That's very embarrassing.

00:27:19.880 --> 00:27:24.040
 They did not go down well welcoming them with the wrong flag.

00:27:24.040 --> 00:27:27.440
 And just at the end, you're Bino, and there was a second Dennis Menis who made his debut

00:27:27.440 --> 00:27:28.840
 in America.

00:27:28.840 --> 00:27:34.400
 Of course, literally within five days of being debuted, yeah, the Americas, Dennis Menis,

00:27:34.400 --> 00:27:38.560
 and they had a very similar look, and they were done completely independently of each other.

00:27:38.560 --> 00:27:41.000
 It was like deep impact in Armageddon.

00:27:41.000 --> 00:27:43.360
 I'm from Bonteno and Dante's peak.

00:27:43.360 --> 00:27:44.360
 Yep.

00:27:44.360 --> 00:27:46.360
 Any others?

00:27:46.360 --> 00:27:48.560
 Um, Genesis and Exodus.

00:27:48.560 --> 00:27:49.560
 The bands?

00:27:49.560 --> 00:27:50.560
 No.

00:27:50.560 --> 00:28:02.840
 So, let's move on to our final fact of the show, and we come on to Mr. Andy Murray.

00:28:02.840 --> 00:28:03.840
 Andy.

00:28:03.840 --> 00:28:04.840
 Okay.

00:28:04.840 --> 00:28:09.880
 My fact is, in the 18th century, there were genuine medsons called Alan's nipple liniment,

00:28:09.880 --> 00:28:16.080
 Grimston's eye snuff, Miller's worm plums, and Italian bussam friend.

00:28:16.080 --> 00:28:19.040
 Do you know what was in any of them, or...

00:28:19.040 --> 00:28:23.920
 Well, somebody said that Grimston's eye snuff was just pepper, just black pepper ground

00:28:23.920 --> 00:28:24.920
 up.

00:28:24.920 --> 00:28:31.760
 But a lot of patent medsons really consisted only of sort of 50% alcohol, so they were...

00:28:31.760 --> 00:28:36.800
 And a lot of them, we call them patent medsons, of course, all these fantastically named old

00:28:36.800 --> 00:28:38.800
 hamlin's wizard oil.

00:28:38.800 --> 00:28:39.880
 Just, you know, beautifully named...

00:28:39.880 --> 00:28:40.880
 How I want that.

00:28:40.880 --> 00:28:41.880
 Yeah.

00:28:41.880 --> 00:28:47.880
 Sugar plums for worms, aromatic lozen jizz of steel, cockings, coff lozen jizz, gingerbread

00:28:47.880 --> 00:28:48.880
 worm cakes.

00:28:48.880 --> 00:28:52.720
 For some of them that did have active ingredients, there was one called Mrs. Winslow's soothing

00:28:52.720 --> 00:28:54.120
 syrup.

00:28:54.120 --> 00:29:01.080
 And that was a mainly a baby's and children, and it contained a full gram of morphine per ounce.

00:29:01.080 --> 00:29:03.640
 And cops' baby friend, that was another baby one.

00:29:03.640 --> 00:29:05.640
 Cops' baby friend.

00:29:05.640 --> 00:29:12.080
 And the label there boasted 8.5% alcohol and 1/8th grain sulfate of opium per ounce.

00:29:12.080 --> 00:29:15.080
 And that was marketed to help baby sleep.

00:29:15.080 --> 00:29:16.080
 Yeah.

00:29:16.080 --> 00:29:20.320
 You could buy heroin, couldn't you, in the first world war, to send to troops on the front

00:29:20.320 --> 00:29:21.320
 line?

00:29:21.320 --> 00:29:22.320
 Yeah.

00:29:22.320 --> 00:29:23.320
 But I didn't harrods, I think.

00:29:23.320 --> 00:29:24.320
 Really, I think so.

00:29:24.320 --> 00:29:25.320
 Still can, I think.

00:29:25.320 --> 00:29:26.320
 I'm not.

00:29:26.320 --> 00:29:27.320
 It's a count.

00:29:27.320 --> 00:29:28.320
 Yeah, but behind harrods.

00:29:28.320 --> 00:29:29.320
 We should fact.

00:29:29.320 --> 00:29:30.320
 (LAUGHTER)

00:29:30.320 --> 00:29:37.960
 Has anyone heard about, during the Middle Ages, when there was the Black Death, that Farts

00:29:37.960 --> 00:29:40.760
 in a jar was a thing that was prescribed for people?

00:29:40.760 --> 00:29:46.040
 Yeah, the idea was that if you conditioned the smell of something quite disgusting,

00:29:46.040 --> 00:29:49.680
 to your nose by the time, if there was an outbreak of Black Death around you, you would become

00:29:49.680 --> 00:29:53.320
 accustomed to that kind of smell, so it kind of made you immune to what was going to happen.

00:29:53.320 --> 00:29:56.400
 So you would go to the doctor, and they would give you a fart in a jar.

00:29:56.400 --> 00:30:00.440
 I don't know if it was your own fart, or if it was a pre-packaged fart, and you would

00:30:00.440 --> 00:30:01.440
 go home with it.

00:30:01.440 --> 00:30:03.640
 And then you would rip open the lid, have a sniff.

00:30:03.640 --> 00:30:06.400
 In case of emergency brake glass.

00:30:06.400 --> 00:30:07.400
 (LAUGHTER)

00:30:07.400 --> 00:30:08.400
 Rake wind.

00:30:08.400 --> 00:30:09.400
 (LAUGHTER)

00:30:09.400 --> 00:30:10.400
 That's incredible.

00:30:10.400 --> 00:30:13.160
 What is that, like an early version of the vaccination idea?

00:30:13.160 --> 00:30:14.160
 Sort of.

00:30:14.160 --> 00:30:18.280
 Making small doses of a poison to build up a resistance, which is the Roman Emperor's

00:30:18.280 --> 00:30:19.280
 did.

00:30:19.280 --> 00:30:20.280
 Yes, exactly.

00:30:20.280 --> 00:30:21.280
 To build up the resistance.

00:30:21.280 --> 00:30:23.680
 You were not putting up a resistance to your own farts.

00:30:23.680 --> 00:30:27.920
 Well, it was fair enough, when I had, which I've been doing for years.

00:30:27.920 --> 00:30:34.280
 When I had my appendix taken out, they cut in testing by accident, and stomach acid

00:30:34.280 --> 00:30:37.280
 was pouring out, and I was digesting myself, right?

00:30:37.280 --> 00:30:41.640
 So I was in hospital for like three months, and you know, I wasn't allowed to eat anything,

00:30:41.640 --> 00:30:47.040
 so because I wasn't allowed to eat anything, because nothing worked, I also confirmed.

00:30:47.040 --> 00:30:52.320
 So there was gas trapped inside, and the nurses did say, "You're allowed to leave or eat

00:30:52.320 --> 00:30:57.880
 when you can fart," and it took me two months to essentially release any gas.

00:30:57.880 --> 00:31:04.720
 And when it came out, it was the worst thing I've ever, ever, ever, but what was also really

00:31:04.720 --> 00:31:08.920
 horrible was that I had to call the nurse to make a smell it.

00:31:08.920 --> 00:31:09.920
 (LAUGHTER)

00:31:09.920 --> 00:31:10.920
 Which is the opposite.

00:31:10.920 --> 00:31:13.520
 I have a feeling you didn't really have to call out.

00:31:13.520 --> 00:31:15.840
 She's probably already ringing your taxi.

00:31:15.840 --> 00:31:19.800
 She's probably got a matching story about the worst thing she's ever smelled, and he called

00:31:19.800 --> 00:31:23.120
 me in to smell it, it wasn't that.

00:31:23.120 --> 00:31:28.000
 The other cool thing about a lot of these medicines that I really like is that beyond all the

00:31:28.000 --> 00:31:32.680
 kind of crazy names they had, some of them probably worked better than a lot of medical

00:31:32.680 --> 00:31:37.200
 alternatives, which were being touted by real doctors, I doctors with medical degrees

00:31:37.200 --> 00:31:38.200
 at the time.

00:31:38.200 --> 00:31:39.200
 Right.

00:31:39.200 --> 00:31:44.420
 And things like homeopathy, in the 18th century, homeopathy was your best bet, because all the

00:31:44.420 --> 00:31:48.560
 other medicines were more likely to kill you and likely to kill you quite fast.

00:31:48.560 --> 00:31:53.680
 So that, I think, has accounted for a lot of alternative and complementary medicines today,

00:31:53.680 --> 00:31:56.840
 still being popular, is that it had an initial lead.

00:31:56.840 --> 00:31:57.840
 Yeah.

00:31:57.840 --> 00:32:01.080
 They used to call them snake oil salesmen, they still do a little bit, don't they?

00:32:01.080 --> 00:32:02.080
 Yeah.

00:32:02.080 --> 00:32:05.120
 And I remember reading that actually snake oil is good for you.

00:32:05.120 --> 00:32:13.040
 If someone sold you some snake oil, it contains 20% of omega-3s, which is a thing that people

00:32:13.040 --> 00:32:17.120
 like to take, it's supposed to be good for your heart, and salmon, which is one thing that

00:32:17.120 --> 00:32:20.000
 people do take for omega-3 on the contains 18%.

00:32:20.000 --> 00:32:22.160
 So actually snake oil would do you a bit of good?

00:32:22.160 --> 00:32:26.120
 I think it's all these medicines, it's trial and error.

00:32:26.120 --> 00:32:33.640
 So at the beginning of medicine time, you know, trying some honey with hedgehog hair, you

00:32:33.640 --> 00:32:34.640
 never know.

00:32:34.640 --> 00:32:35.640
 You'd be like, yeah, just try that.

00:32:35.640 --> 00:32:36.640
 Yeah.

00:32:36.640 --> 00:32:37.640
 For your eyes.

00:32:37.640 --> 00:32:38.640
 For your eyes, probably as well.

00:32:38.640 --> 00:32:43.640
 The last thing when you're in pain, you're a little bit delirious, and you'll turn to your

00:32:43.640 --> 00:32:47.440
 friend, your internet friend, just to go, what do I take?

00:32:47.440 --> 00:32:48.840
 And they'll just say, oh, yeah, just do that.

00:32:48.840 --> 00:32:49.840
 And you will do it.

00:32:49.840 --> 00:32:50.840
 Yeah.

00:32:50.840 --> 00:32:57.280
 There's a group of people in the Amazon who they like to put snakes down their trousers

00:32:57.280 --> 00:33:00.640
 to bite their penises, which gives them length and directions, and I wonder how they

00:33:00.640 --> 00:33:01.640
 found that out.

00:33:01.640 --> 00:33:07.040
 They're really just trying to cure their runny noses, that's what they claim.

00:33:07.040 --> 00:33:11.360
 I was reading a lot about placebo, in relation to, you know, this kind of medicine.

00:33:11.360 --> 00:33:12.360
 This is incredible.

00:33:12.360 --> 00:33:20.800
 There was a drug introduced in the 70s called Cymetadine, which cured 80% of stomach ulcers.

00:33:20.800 --> 00:33:25.480
 Now as time passed, it felt just 50% of stomach ulcers which it cured.

00:33:25.480 --> 00:33:30.200
 And this seems to have occurred after the introduction of renitadine, which is a competing

00:33:30.200 --> 00:33:33.160
 and it was supposedly a better, more effective drug.

00:33:33.160 --> 00:33:38.720
 So people think that the placebo effect of the initial drug stopped working because doctors

00:33:38.720 --> 00:33:44.000
 knew there was another supposedly better drug, and that's why the success rate fell.

00:33:44.000 --> 00:33:48.240
 Because doctors have also been tested giving medicine to patients, and half of them have

00:33:48.240 --> 00:33:49.920
 said, I think this is a really good drug.

00:33:49.920 --> 00:33:51.000
 I'm very excited about it.

00:33:51.000 --> 00:33:52.800
 It's shown really well in trials.

00:33:52.800 --> 00:33:56.800
 And half of them have said, I'm not sure about this, but take it anyway, see if it does

00:33:56.800 --> 00:34:02.520
 be good, patients have reported much less pain with the first sample adopted, same pill.

00:34:02.520 --> 00:34:03.520
 It's incredible.

00:34:03.520 --> 00:34:04.520
 Wow.

00:34:04.520 --> 00:34:05.520
 Yeah.

00:34:05.520 --> 00:34:07.480
 And placebo injections are more effective than placebo pills, because it's more dramatic

00:34:07.480 --> 00:34:08.480
 intervention.

00:34:08.480 --> 00:34:10.000
 It feels culturally people think that.

00:34:10.000 --> 00:34:13.840
 I wonder if placebo works with all of these really weird things that they did in the

00:34:13.840 --> 00:34:16.240
 light, the middle ages and stuff like that.

00:34:16.240 --> 00:34:20.760
 So like, for instance, in the 14th century, one reason, one way that you could cure impotence

00:34:20.760 --> 00:34:24.320
 was to wear your trousers on your head for 24 hours.

00:34:24.320 --> 00:34:27.840
 It's hard to imagine the placebo effect work in that.

00:34:27.840 --> 00:34:31.160
 It's hard to imagine finding anyone who wants to have sex with you after you're on the

00:34:31.160 --> 00:34:33.080
 village all day with the trousers on your head.

00:34:33.080 --> 00:34:35.080
 Speak for yourself.

00:34:35.080 --> 00:34:36.960
 The placebo effect doesn't always work, though.

00:34:36.960 --> 00:34:41.720
 I was reading about Greek philosopher Heraclitus, who spent the last day of his life laying

00:34:41.720 --> 00:34:48.720
 the sun, covered in cow dung, convinced it would cure him, and it didn't work.

00:34:48.720 --> 00:34:56.760
 Curum of, from what, friendship?

00:34:56.760 --> 00:35:04.640
 Perfectly right, just to add that it was until 1916 that you could buy cocaine and heroin

00:35:04.640 --> 00:35:05.640
 at Harrods.

00:35:05.640 --> 00:35:09.840
 I thought this was a joke or not, but in the article it said, you could buy gift packs of

00:35:09.840 --> 00:35:11.640
 both the send to soldiers.

00:35:11.640 --> 00:35:12.640
 Yeah.

00:35:12.640 --> 00:35:13.640
 Wow.

00:35:13.640 --> 00:35:14.640
 That's true.

00:35:14.640 --> 00:35:15.640
 It was a very nice little Christmas gift.

00:35:15.640 --> 00:35:18.560
 I had fun when you were talking, watching the weirdest YouTube video I've ever seen

00:35:18.560 --> 00:35:21.320
 about how to bottle your farts, so thanks for that.

00:35:21.320 --> 00:35:26.120
 According to N-miniac, the way to do it is to do it while you're in the bath, because that's

00:35:26.120 --> 00:35:30.440
 how you can best direct said fart to jar, but what I quite like was he began his video by

00:35:30.440 --> 00:35:33.840
 washing out the jar before he put the farts in.

00:35:33.840 --> 00:35:36.000
 Oh, yeah, you don't want to get that jar dirty.

00:35:36.000 --> 00:35:37.000
 Yeah.

00:35:37.000 --> 00:35:41.000
 I just sort of quickly add that from the website that I got the farts in the jar from,

00:35:41.000 --> 00:35:45.720
 there was a line at the bottom talking about, because it gave examples of how it was done

00:35:45.720 --> 00:35:46.720
 and so on.

00:35:46.720 --> 00:35:50.560
 It's sounds funny now, but the plague was no joke.

00:35:50.560 --> 00:36:05.240
 OK, that's it for another episode of No Such Thing as a Fish.

00:36:05.240 --> 00:36:06.240
 That's all of our facts.

00:36:06.240 --> 00:36:07.920
