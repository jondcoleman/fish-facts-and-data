00:00:00,00:00:04,[MUSIC]
00:00:04,00:00:08,"Hey Clubfish members, welcome to your secret bonus bit of content."
00:00:08,00:00:10,We've got a compilation for you today.
00:00:10,00:00:14,This is the best of the outtakes of things that didn't make it to the main show.
00:00:14,00:00:17,"It features me, James, Andy, and Anna."
00:00:17,00:00:19,But you've got some bonus voices joining us this week.
00:00:19,00:00:25,"We've got Reese Darby, the brilliant Reese, and of course, the excellent Miles Jupp."
00:00:25,00:00:27,You will have heard them on recent episodes.
00:00:27,00:00:32,And this is all the stuff that didn't quite fit into the main episodes.
00:00:32,00:00:36,"Oh and quickly before we get into it, just a quick thank you to everyone who came to the Crosswise festival."
00:00:36,00:00:38,We had such a fun gig.
00:00:38,00:00:41,There was an awesome ending to it where we did a quiz with members from the audience.
00:00:41,00:00:43,It was just so much fun.
00:00:43,00:00:45,So thank you everyone who came.
00:00:45,00:00:48,There's some people traveled all the way from America to come see the show.
00:00:48,00:00:50,Hope you enjoyed it.
00:00:50,00:00:54,"And if anyone else wants to come and see us do another live show,"
00:00:54,00:00:56,we're returning to the London Podcast Festival.
00:00:56,00:00:59,We're going to be there on the 5th and 6th of September.
00:00:59,00:01:03,We've got a couple of great guests lined up to join us on stage.
00:01:03,00:01:05,Go to know such thing as a fish.com.
00:01:05,00:01:06,You'll find the links there.
00:01:06,00:01:08,Come and see us live.
00:01:08,00:01:11,And I believe that there's going to be online streaming as well.
00:01:11,00:01:14,"So if you are overseas and you want to watch it,"
00:01:14,00:01:18,do check it out and buy your tickets to watch it online as it happens live.
00:01:18,00:01:23,"Last thing to mention is if you miss last week's drop us a line,"
00:01:23,00:01:26,just to let you know that the price of club fish is going up by 1 pound.
00:01:26,00:01:30,So it is going to be 3 pounds 99 going forward.
00:01:30,00:01:31,Hope that's okay with you all.
00:01:31,00:01:35,We promise that we're going to continue to put out really fun formats.
00:01:35,00:01:37,So don't go anywhere.
00:01:37,00:01:39,And don't go anywhere right now because here we go.
00:01:39,00:01:40,It's the compilation.
00:01:40,00:01:44,The four fishers recent miles on with the outtakes.
00:01:44,00:02:06,"- There's a world one connection,"
00:02:06,00:02:08,as well as a world two connection in ugly.
00:02:08,00:02:10,Which is really cool actually.
00:02:10,00:02:13,"So in world one, there was an understandable fear that the Germans"
00:02:13,00:02:15,were going to invade via Essex.
00:02:15,00:02:20,And a plan was drawn up to evacuate the whole of Essex to Oxfordshire.
00:02:20,00:02:21,1.4 million people.
00:02:21,00:02:24,I don't think they told the people of Oxfordshire.
00:02:24,00:02:26,"- Yeah, you were, what do you hear? - You didn't mention it."
00:02:26,00:02:27,There's going to be some stuff happening.
00:02:27,00:02:29,Just don't worry about it.
00:02:29,00:02:30,Just keep your door shut.
00:02:30,00:02:33,"But they all got these, you know, things from the council saying"
00:02:33,00:02:35,this is what to do.
00:02:35,00:02:37,- Councils have really diminished over there.
00:02:37,00:02:39,They're like now they sometimes can't collect glass.
00:02:39,00:02:43,"Well, there's the undefonding, isn't it? We don't get the war anymore."
00:02:43,00:02:48,"And the information said, when ugly church bells ring incessantly,"
00:02:48,00:02:51,"that's your sign, get out, goes to Oxfordshire."
00:02:51,00:02:55,"And they also, and they were told destroy all alcohol"
00:02:55,00:02:58,because if the Germans arrive and they're invading
00:02:58,00:03:03,"and they get drunk, that's even worse than a sober invading Nazi."
00:03:03,00:03:04,Which is quite weird.
00:03:04,00:03:06,"- Really, that is weird because didn't,"
00:03:06,00:03:08,wasn't the battle of fishguard when the French came over?
00:03:09,00:03:12,"In the 18th century, the last time Britain was invaded at all."
00:03:12,00:03:15,"They arrived, they all got drunk and couldn't do anything."
00:03:15,00:03:17,"- Well, I think it's really on the fence."
00:03:17,00:03:19,"Yes, will alcohol make the invaders worse or better?"
00:03:19,00:03:21,And maybe it depends on whether they're French or German.
00:03:21,00:03:22,"- Oh, yeah, maybe."
00:03:22,00:03:26,"But anyway, it's really cool because everyone was given"
00:03:26,00:03:27,these evacuation routes.
00:03:27,00:03:29,And it meant you had to take all the back roads
00:03:29,00:03:31,because the army would be using the main roads.
00:03:31,00:03:34,So they had these maps and there were arrows all over Essex
00:03:34,00:03:37,painted on walls and trees and lamp posts
00:03:37,00:03:39,and big white arrows showing people the way.
00:03:39,00:03:43,And the only remnant that remains now is in Ugly.
00:03:43,00:03:47,There's a wall which just has now only the little plaque left saying
00:03:47,00:03:50,"this is where the big white arrow was saying, ""Get out of door."""
00:03:50,00:03:53,"Imagine arriving as a Nazi going, ""Where is everyone?"""
00:03:53,00:03:56,And then seeing giant arrows pointing at you towards
00:03:56,00:03:58,where you needed to go.
00:03:58,00:04:02,"- We haven't got this through, Winston."
00:04:02,00:04:05,Protesters have some good gear.
00:04:06,00:04:08,Like I was looking at Stanstead protests.
00:04:08,00:04:10,So there was a protest in Stanstead a few years ago
00:04:10,00:04:14,over a bunch of migrants who were being sent away
00:04:14,00:04:16,and that one of those taken in the dead of night
00:04:16,00:04:19,stuck on a charter plane sent back to the country
00:04:19,00:04:22,from which they'd come from a while ago.
00:04:22,00:04:24,Big protest about that.
00:04:24,00:04:28,But the way they did it was they formed a circle around the plane.
00:04:28,00:04:29,So they got bought cutters.
00:04:29,00:04:30,They got into Stanstead Airport.
00:04:30,00:04:32,They formed a circle around the plane
00:04:32,00:04:35,and they locked themselves in this circle
00:04:35,00:04:39,by putting their arms in pipes filled with expanding foam
00:04:39,00:04:41,and attaching their arms to each other.
00:04:41,00:04:42,So I put my arm in one end of the pipe
00:04:42,00:04:44,and he puts his arm in the other.
00:04:44,00:04:45,"Where you get it, what does it expand?"
00:04:45,00:04:48,- It's almost like you know those Chinese finger traps
00:04:48,00:04:49,"that you put your fingers in,"
00:04:49,00:04:50,but like a super big version of that.
00:04:50,00:04:52,"- Exactly, it's a giant one of those."
00:04:52,00:04:53,- What if I need a piss?
00:04:53,00:04:55,"- Well, you can't, you just have to go loose."
00:04:55,00:04:56,You can't hold your willy.
00:04:56,00:04:59,"- So sorry, you're in a big circle with your arms in the pipes."
00:04:59,00:05:00,Or our fingers touching.
00:05:00,00:05:02,- If you want to be happy.
00:05:02,00:05:03,- Possibly not.
00:05:03,00:05:06,"- I don't think they, I think you don't want them touching"
00:05:06,00:05:08,because you could have a wider circumference
00:05:08,00:05:09,if you're not touching.
00:05:09,00:05:10,- What do you mean?
00:05:10,00:05:11,"- Oh yeah, true."
00:05:11,00:05:13,- But what if I feel lonely or scared?
00:05:13,00:05:15,"- No, I do want to be holding hands with someone."
00:05:15,00:05:18,- They're the sacrifices you make to save these things.
00:05:18,00:05:20,- Someone else can't even help me have a piss
00:05:20,00:05:21,because they've got their arms in the kitchen.
00:05:21,00:05:23,"- Well, there's got to be, I've got it."
00:05:23,00:05:24,There's got to be an external agent
00:05:24,00:05:27,who's free to go around helping people have a piss.
00:05:27,00:05:28,"- There was one piss helper, yes."
00:05:28,00:05:32,- What do we need to do then is arrest the piss assistant
00:05:33,00:05:34,and then the whole protest falls apart.
00:05:34,00:05:38,"- Yeah, they all wet themselves and it's over."
00:05:38,00:05:40,- And that's how all protests tend.
00:05:40,00:05:41,"- I need the toilet, let's go."
00:05:41,00:05:43,"I've wet myself, we're done for the day."
00:05:43,00:05:44,- How did it end then?
00:05:44,00:05:47,How did they actually un-tube them?
00:05:47,00:05:47,- They're still there.
00:05:47,00:05:48,- They're still there.
00:05:48,00:05:49,- They're still there.
00:05:49,00:05:51,- I've claimed stuck in the middle.
00:05:51,00:05:54,They tried to prosecute them on.
00:05:54,00:05:56,"Some, actually, anti-terrorism charges"
00:05:56,00:05:57,before our judge a couple of years ago.
00:05:57,00:05:59,So that's fucking ridiculous.
00:05:59,00:06:00,These guys aren't terrorists.
00:06:00,00:06:02,But they were extracted from the pipes first.
00:06:02,00:06:04,I don't think anyone's still walking around with the pipes.
00:06:04,00:06:05,- Catch their arms.
00:06:05,00:06:09,"- If you are writing, oh, you can't, probably."
00:06:09,00:06:12,"- If your piss helper is free,"
00:06:12,00:06:14,they ask if they can drop us a line.
00:06:14,00:06:19,- Is a stanza to Gatwick that's won the award for best toilet
00:06:19,00:06:20,like multiple years?
00:06:20,00:06:22,- I can't be stanced at.
00:06:22,00:06:22,- No?
00:06:22,00:06:26,- Unless they're talking about the entire app policy
00:06:26,00:06:27,for the toilet.
00:06:27,00:06:29,"- Is it, can I ask that?"
00:06:29,00:06:32,Is it an individual cubicle or is it a design of toilet?
00:06:32,00:06:33,"- No, no, it's the whole toilet."
00:06:33,00:06:34,It's the cleanliness.
00:06:34,00:06:37,It's in the window as you go down into the toilets.
00:06:37,00:06:38,"You know, you walked in and go, wow."
00:06:38,00:06:40,"- Wait, there's a window as you go down to the toilet."
00:06:40,00:06:42,"- Yeah, it's a little cabinet where they keep it."
00:06:42,00:06:44,"- It's a viewing, does your toilet have a viewing though?"
00:06:44,00:06:45,- It should.
00:06:45,00:06:52,- Can I give you a music recommendation related to this fact?
00:06:52,00:06:53,"- Yes, please."
00:06:53,00:06:54,- It's my favorite song I found recently.
00:06:54,00:06:57,"So in 1978, for sure, some listeners remember,"
00:06:57,00:06:59,there was the big frequency change
00:06:59,00:07:01,"where all of the radio stations in the UK,"
00:07:01,00:07:02,"all the big BBC ones,"
00:07:02,00:07:04,hops to a different frequency
00:07:04,00:07:06,because of e-regulations.
00:07:06,00:07:09,And no one had the internet then.
00:07:09,00:07:10,"So it was like, how are they going to know"
00:07:10,00:07:12,"that their station is at a different frequency,"
00:07:12,00:07:14,especially given that.
00:07:14,00:07:17,I believe Radio 3 hopped the frequency
00:07:17,00:07:18,that used to be Radio 1.
00:07:18,00:07:21,So you'd tune in hoping for Tony Blackburn
00:07:21,00:07:23,"and you'd get, in certain name,"
00:07:23,00:07:26,with famous Radio 3 presenter in the 1970s.
00:07:26,00:07:28,- I honestly thought the Tony Blackburn
00:07:28,00:07:29,was currently on Radio 3 with you.
00:07:29,00:07:32,"- He might be, he might be."
00:07:32,00:07:34,And the only reason I know it's him is because
00:07:34,00:07:36,one of the things they did to tell people was
00:07:36,00:07:40,Tony Blackburn stayed at Radio 3 for the day to tell people
00:07:40,00:07:42,"a bit like if you move house,"
00:07:42,00:07:44,you stay at the house that you've just moved out of.
00:07:44,00:07:46,"So when your mates come around, you can go,"
00:07:46,00:07:47,"""I don't live here anymore."""
00:07:47,00:07:49,"So if you tuned in, he'd be like,"
00:07:49,00:07:50,"""Hello, it's me, Tony."
00:07:50,00:07:51,"I'm not here anymore, though."""
00:07:51,00:07:52,- That's not confusing at all.
00:07:52,00:07:54,- Go to the stage.
00:07:54,00:07:56,"- Well, they get someone else to say,"
00:07:56,00:07:58,Tony doesn't live here anymore.
00:07:58,00:08:00,"- If you want him, he's on Radio 1."
00:08:00,00:08:02,- It's just a dedicated guy.
00:08:02,00:08:03,"- That's great, that's so good."
00:08:03,00:08:05,- It was also this incredible song
00:08:05,00:08:08,"by the King Singers, who are very famous"
00:08:08,00:08:10,"at the time, Accapella Group from King's College Cambridge."
00:08:10,00:08:12,They released a single to help people remember
00:08:12,00:08:14,all the new frequencies.
00:08:14,00:08:16,And you've got to look at that.
00:08:16,00:08:17,It's beautiful.
00:08:17,00:08:20,"It starts, just I'll just give you the first line."
00:08:20,00:08:23,A new international agreement comes into effect.
00:08:23,00:08:26,And many of the frequencies used for the BBC
00:08:26,00:08:29,will be changed at a time.
00:08:29,00:08:30,I think it was unlike that.
00:08:30,00:08:32,"- Is that the tune, or are you just riff that?"
00:08:32,00:08:34,- It's a bit like that.
00:08:34,00:08:36,"It's like, Accapella Church music."
00:08:36,00:08:37,- Wow.
00:08:37,00:08:39,- But it told everyone what frequencies to go to.
00:08:39,00:08:41,"- I reckon, because it said at a time,"
00:08:41,00:08:43,that was a really weird way of saying it.
00:08:43,00:08:46,But the frequency for Radio 1 was 97 to 99.
00:08:46,00:08:49,So was it that it was a rhyme if that was it?
00:08:49,00:08:52,- They were actually different frequencies at the time.
00:08:52,00:08:56,"And so it's, and there wasn't that much rhyming in this."
00:08:56,00:08:58,I must say much like a lot of songs.
00:08:58,00:09:01,- The whole point of putting things in a song
00:09:01,00:09:04,"to help you remember, is it make them rhyme?"
00:09:04,00:09:06,- There's no way it makes it easier whatsoever.
00:09:06,00:09:07,"It's just a string of numbers,"
00:09:07,00:09:09,somewhere much require boys.
00:09:09,00:09:13,- There were two.
00:09:13,00:09:16,"In fact, the world's only two female fighter pilot aces,"
00:09:16,00:09:17,"which I think to be an ace,"
00:09:17,00:09:19,you sort of had to shoot down five planes
00:09:19,00:09:21,or more vaguely varied.
00:09:21,00:09:24,"But one of them was this woman called Lillia Litviak,"
00:09:24,00:09:26,who was in one of the other regiments
00:09:26,00:09:29,that were flying for the Soviets in the Second World War.
00:09:29,00:09:32,And there was just an account which she recounted
00:09:32,00:09:34,"and people who were in the same regiment as her recounted,"
00:09:34,00:09:35,"which sounds really fun,"
00:09:35,00:09:40,where she was in this dogfight with a German called Irvenmeier.
00:09:40,00:09:42,And he'd shot down 12 planes before.
00:09:42,00:09:44,So he was well up there in ace territory.
00:09:44,00:09:47,And she defeated him really resoundingly.
00:09:47,00:09:49,And then it sounds like there's one of those nice moments
00:09:49,00:09:51,"where he came right down, he was okay."
00:09:51,00:09:55,"But he was like, who the hell defeats me?"
00:09:55,00:09:59,Introduce me to the man who just bested me.
00:09:59,00:10:01,And so they trotted him up.
00:10:01,00:10:02,"Yeah, did you read about this?"
00:10:02,00:10:03,"- No, I'm just excited."
00:10:03,00:10:05,"- Yeah, go on."
00:10:05,00:10:08,"- So he got shot down, but he landed okay or?"
00:10:08,00:10:09,- He landed okay in that way.
00:10:09,00:10:11,People seem to sometimes survive.
00:10:11,00:10:13,And demanded to be taken to the man who shot him down.
00:10:13,00:10:15,"- Yeah, I was so presumptuous."
00:10:15,00:10:16,- I know.
00:10:16,00:10:19,- I just think you don't automatically get to meet the person
00:10:19,00:10:19,who shot you down.
00:10:19,00:10:23,- That's not my voice for you.
00:10:23,00:10:24,- You've got to follow themselves.
00:10:24,00:10:26,"- Yeah, he was pissed off."
00:10:26,00:10:28,"He was introduced to a woman, he said,"
00:10:28,00:10:29,"""Bugger off, guys, come on."
00:10:29,00:10:30,Where's the real guy?
00:10:30,00:10:31,"Stop taking a piss."""
00:10:31,00:10:32,"- Very funny, okay, yeah."
00:10:32,00:10:34,"That happened to Mary Ellis,"
00:10:34,00:10:35,who was another of the 88 girls.
00:10:35,00:10:36,"She landed a Wellington bomber,"
00:10:36,00:10:38,"which was a black and huge plane at the time,"
00:10:38,00:10:40,at an RAF base.
00:10:40,00:10:43,"And the staff said, ""Oh great, so where's the pilot?"""
00:10:43,00:10:44,"And she said, ""Oh, I'm the pilot."""
00:10:44,00:10:46,"And they point blank refused to believe it,"
00:10:46,00:10:48,"to the extent of searching the plane,"
00:10:48,00:10:50,because they thought they were being pranked.
00:10:50,00:10:51,But there's no way this would work.
00:10:51,00:10:54,- And he also does that on just normal domestic flights.
00:10:54,00:10:56,"If it's a woman who comes up at the time,"
00:10:56,00:10:59,"he's like, ""Come on, let's get the real one on."""
00:10:59,00:11:01,"- Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:11:01,00:11:04,"Dolores Moghrin, she became a pilot after the war."
00:11:04,00:11:06,"She wasn't allowed to say, ""This is your captain speaking."""
00:11:06,00:11:07,- What? - Because people would freak out
00:11:07,00:11:10,and presumably storm the cockpit or whatever.
00:11:10,00:11:11,- Yes.
00:11:11,00:11:14,"- Can I just say, ""I'm never quite sure on airplanes."""
00:11:14,00:11:16,"When they say, ""This is your captain."""
00:11:16,00:11:18,I'm never sure if it's the person who's piloting
00:11:18,00:11:20,"and plane speaking, all the head of the steward"
00:11:20,00:11:21,and stewardessing staff.
00:11:21,00:11:23,"- I think it's the captain. - Yeah, it's the person piloting."
00:11:23,00:11:25,"- When they say, ""This is the captain speaking,"""
00:11:25,00:11:27,"generally speaking, it's the captain."
00:11:27,00:11:28,- It's not the stewardess.
00:11:28,00:11:31,"- Unless they say, ""This is the captain of catering speaking."""
00:11:31,00:11:35,You will receive your cups of tea very shortly.
00:11:35,00:11:38,"Just texting at the moment to the airport, actually."
00:11:38,00:11:39,- There's going to be a little bit of turbulence
00:11:39,00:11:40,"on the trolley this afternoon,"
00:11:40,00:11:42,but we're going to get your drinks to you.
00:11:44,00:11:45,"- No, who invented Larson Found Officers?"
00:11:45,00:11:48,- Is it someone... - It's my famous.
00:11:48,00:11:49,- Is this guy called Conan Doyle?
00:11:49,00:11:50,- Winston Doyle. - It's always Conan Doyle.
00:11:50,00:11:52,- Neither of those two.
00:11:52,00:11:54,"But it's someone more famous, in fact,"
00:11:54,00:11:55,"than either of those two, I would say."
00:11:55,00:11:57,- Thanks to the Winston Churchill. - Genghis Khan.
00:11:57,00:11:58,- Jesus. - John Wayne.
00:11:58,00:12:00,- It was Napoleon Donapat.
00:12:00,00:12:02,"- Oh, I forgot. - Oh, wow."
00:12:02,00:12:03,"- Sorry, Andy."
00:12:03,00:12:04,- Napoleon won? - Yeah.
00:12:04,00:12:05,- I can't even walk.
00:12:05,00:12:06,You're saying he invented now what?
00:12:06,00:12:07,- Larson Found. - Larson Found.
00:12:07,00:12:09,- Yeah. - It's been so long.
00:12:09,00:12:10,"- Part of his thing,"
00:12:10,00:12:13,"like Napoleon was bringing everything to Paris,"
00:12:13,00:12:16,"kind of thing, like centralising the whole country."
00:12:16,00:12:20,"And as part of that, he set up an office on the Yildesitay"
00:12:20,00:12:22,"for lost objects, and it still exists."
00:12:22,00:12:26,- Cool. - And they have a cabinet of curiosities
00:12:26,00:12:27,"that include several human skulls,"
00:12:27,00:12:31,"a wooden leg, and two chunks of masonry"
00:12:31,00:12:32,from the World Trade Centre.
00:12:32,00:12:34,And can you believe that?
00:12:34,00:12:36,"- Well, that's somehow got lost."
00:12:36,00:12:39,"- Yeah. - Well, that's the thing with Larson Found."
00:12:39,00:12:40,"You don't know how it got there, right?"
00:12:40,00:12:43,- How do they know the masonry is from the World Trade Centre?
00:12:44,00:12:45,- There must be clues.
00:12:45,00:12:46,- They've properly analysed that.
00:12:46,00:12:47,Wow.
00:12:47,00:12:48,- I guess so. - That was amazing.
00:12:48,00:12:51,- Yeah. - And the modern system there
00:12:51,00:12:53,"was organised by a guy called Louis Lapine,"
00:12:53,00:12:56,who was known as the Little Man with a big stick.
00:12:56,00:13:00,"And he was a French policeman,"
00:13:00,00:13:04,"and he was well known for handling the crowds in Paris,"
00:13:04,00:13:05,whenever there was riots and stuff.
00:13:05,00:13:10,But he was also famous for accusing
00:13:10,00:13:14,"friend of the podcast, a polinear of stealing the Mona Lisa."
00:13:14,00:13:15,Do you remember that story?
00:13:15,00:13:17,"- Yeah, and the cast. - And the reason,"
00:13:17,00:13:18,I'm sure you're very familiar.
00:13:18,00:13:20,"- Yes, this was episode 300."
00:13:20,00:13:21,- He chose what sort of thing.
00:13:21,00:13:22,That was a very good one.
00:13:22,00:13:24,- I enjoyed that. - I think I was driving
00:13:24,00:13:26,from Patnie.
00:13:26,00:13:28,- He had an accident.
00:13:28,00:13:32,"- But yeah, he was like really famous"
00:13:32,00:13:34,and really well respected.
00:13:34,00:13:34,But when this...
00:13:34,00:13:35,- A big stick.
00:13:35,00:13:37,- A big stick.
00:13:37,00:13:38,"- They had to respect him, yeah."
00:13:38,00:13:40,"But when this Mona Lisa thing happened,"
00:13:40,00:13:42,"he lost all of his credibility, really."
00:13:42,00:13:44,"- The police officer, Lapine."
00:13:44,00:13:46,"- They say when you've got with the Mona Lisa,"
00:13:46,00:13:49,because it's been stolen quite a few times.
00:13:49,00:13:50,"But every time,"
00:13:50,00:13:53,"it doesn't matter where you're coming from to steal it,"
00:13:53,00:13:55,the painting can see you.
00:13:55,00:13:59,"- And this is actually a good hint,"
00:13:59,00:14:03,the only way to get it without her seeing you
00:14:03,00:14:04,is going from behind.
00:14:04,00:14:06,- And that's the wall.
00:14:07,00:14:09,"- Don't take that advice out of context, please."
00:14:09,00:14:15,"- Just on like early trends in general,"
00:14:15,00:14:19,have you heard about railway madmen?
00:14:19,00:14:22,"- This was a... - Oh, was it like spinoff?"
00:14:22,00:14:22,- Yeah.
00:14:22,00:14:31,- What was that?
00:14:31,00:14:34,- It was the opening theme.
00:14:37,00:14:39,"- This was the thing, when trains were introduced,"
00:14:39,00:14:41,"and growing, there was railway mania,"
00:14:41,00:14:43,"which was when everyone was just building trains,"
00:14:43,00:14:44,"across the UK in particular,"
00:14:44,00:14:47,"with no thought of whether they needed to be a train, basically."
00:14:47,00:14:49,"- No, they got given huge subsidies"
00:14:49,00:14:51,for building train tracks and stuff.
00:14:51,00:14:53,"- For a while, it was the most profitable thing you could do."
00:14:53,00:14:55,So people were just building mad little railways
00:14:55,00:14:57,"everywhere, thousands of miles."
00:14:57,00:14:59,But railway madmen was a different thing.
00:14:59,00:15:01,"People were worried at the time of social change,"
00:15:01,00:15:04,and you were locked in the compartments.
00:15:04,00:15:05,That was another thing.
00:15:05,00:15:09,"So people really freaked out at the prospect of train travel,"
00:15:09,00:15:10,making people lose their way.
00:15:10,00:15:12,"It's specifically man as well,"
00:15:12,00:15:15,"and just go bananas and berserk, basically."
00:15:15,00:15:17,- Yeah. - 'Cause of the speed you were going?
00:15:17,00:15:18,'Cause of the speed...
00:15:18,00:15:20,"- Also, it enclosed in tunnels a lot."
00:15:20,00:15:21,I think that was a problem.
00:15:21,00:15:22,- There was a lot of...
00:15:22,00:15:24,"Yeah, there's a historian called Amy Millen Smith,"
00:15:24,00:15:28,"and she did a fantastic report on this,"
00:15:28,00:15:29,like a thesis about it.
00:15:29,00:15:32,"So it was normal men who were completely fine,"
00:15:32,00:15:34,"but it was partly all the stuff you said, James,"
00:15:34,00:15:37,and partly stress and overwork and anxiety of mod...
00:15:37,00:15:39,"Like just modern life, the modern condition,"
00:15:39,00:15:42,"meant that, you know, in 1869, a gentleman suddenly"
00:15:42,00:15:44,took off all his clothing and leaned out of the windows
00:15:44,00:15:46,"of his carriage, talking nonsense, you know."
00:15:46,00:15:49,"And it was just apparently as soon as the train stopped,"
00:15:49,00:15:51,"or they got off the train, they completely recovered their wits,"
00:15:51,00:15:52,and they were fine.
00:15:52,00:15:54,It was literally the act of being on a moving train.
00:15:54,00:15:57,"- Now hang on, can I button with..."
00:15:57,00:16:00,Is there anything to do with sitting backwards on a train?
00:16:00,00:16:03,"- Oh, don't worry. - They looked into that scientific issue whereby"
00:16:03,00:16:06,it could drive you mad if you're always facing the wrong way
00:16:06,00:16:08,and going in a certain direction.
00:16:08,00:16:10,- Yeah. - And I hope it's going backwards on a train.
00:16:10,00:16:11,"- It feels sick, yeah, yeah. - It's you."
00:16:11,00:16:13,"- Yeah, none of you guys. - I love it."
00:16:13,00:16:16,"- Well, yeah, I'm not a fan of it."
00:16:16,00:16:19,So I think it could be linked to a bit of madness that might come.
00:16:19,00:16:21,- I prefer it. I prefer seeing backwards on my...
00:16:21,00:16:22,"- Yeah, yeah, yeah. - I actually prefer it as well,"
00:16:22,00:16:24,"because if you crash head on to something,"
00:16:24,00:16:26,then you have something to stop you from...
00:16:26,00:16:27,"- Oh, y'all crash theory."
00:16:27,00:16:27,- Yeah.
00:16:27,00:16:31,"- And don't think backwards crash theory. - Yeah, yeah, that's interesting."
00:16:31,00:16:35,"- So you think James that they should put all the seats in a car backwards, presumably?"
00:16:35,00:16:37,"- Well, I think I'm not the only person who thinks that."
00:16:37,00:16:39,"- Really? - I mean, that is safer."
00:16:39,00:16:40,"- Except the driver seat, presumably."
00:16:40,00:16:45,- Just don't hold the cars reverse everywhere.
00:16:45,00:16:46,- Yeah.
00:16:46,00:16:48,"- That's... yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:16:48,00:16:50,- Just lean around. You're arm over the other seat.
00:16:50,00:16:51,You do that classic move.
00:16:51,00:16:52,"- Yes, nice, nice. - Yeah."
00:16:52,00:16:54,- Everyone would drive a lot more slowly.
00:16:54,00:16:55,- Yeah. - Just safer.
00:16:56,00:16:59,- Do you guys know a right-handed batter called...
00:16:59,00:17:05,"Lassa Rousseau, Talibula, Minerva, Lenny Vé Vaca,"
00:17:05,00:17:09,"Boulin, Miner, Kula, Cala, Kebalau?"
00:17:09,00:17:11,"- Yes, of course. - Yeah, I have his shirt,"
00:17:11,00:17:13,but it can't be a fortune to get his name on the pack.
00:17:13,00:17:16,Is that... - I don't know him.
00:17:16,00:17:19,- Is it a real name of someone we have heard of?
00:17:19,00:17:19,"- No, no, it's not."
00:17:19,00:17:21,"It's just the longest crooked, his name ever,"
00:17:21,00:17:23,but he's just a pacific ricketer from Fiji.
00:17:23,00:17:24,And he sounds like a great guy.
00:17:24,00:17:26,Larger because of his long name.
00:17:26,00:17:28,"His surname means ""Returned Alive"""
00:17:28,00:17:31,"from Nancula Hospital at La Kemba Island in the Lao Group,"
00:17:31,00:17:34,which is easier to pronounce if you want to do it that way.
00:17:34,00:17:36,"- Last members for the Lao Group, please."
00:17:36,00:17:37,Last members for the Lao Group.
00:17:37,00:17:41,Buses departing shortly.
00:17:41,00:17:44,"But yeah, he was great."
00:17:44,00:17:45,He used to...
00:17:45,00:17:47,"They played one international game, Fiji,"
00:17:47,00:17:50,against New Zealand in the 1940s and '50s when he played.
00:17:50,00:17:54,"And they made him serenade them with South Sea songs after the match,"
00:17:54,00:17:55,which he did.
00:17:55,00:17:57,"A game, lovely man, I know."
00:17:57,00:18:02,- You know that it took 120 years after the invention of the cricket box
00:18:02,00:18:04,to invent the cricket helmet.
00:18:04,00:18:07,- Okay.
00:18:07,00:18:09,- I like to post that show to people's priorities.
00:18:09,00:18:11,"- Pretty much. - Why, doesn't it?"
00:18:11,00:18:12,- Would you agree with that?
00:18:12,00:18:15,"- I'd have thought, yeah, even terms of what you're keen on."
00:18:15,00:18:16,I suppose it...
00:18:16,00:18:17,- You've got a skull.
00:18:17,00:18:19,You don't have a penis skull.
00:18:19,00:18:21,- You don't have a genital exoskeleton.
00:18:21,00:18:21,- Exactly.
00:18:21,00:18:22,- Yeah.
00:18:22,00:18:27,- We're hoping these less than the guys can do something.
00:18:27,00:18:32,- The ball is generally going to be in the lower part of your body.
00:18:32,00:18:33,- Amid ships.
00:18:33,00:18:34,- Yeah.
00:18:34,00:18:37,"- Well, it's absolutely about how bouncing the surface as well, isn't it?"
00:18:37,00:18:40,These days it's very bouncing because they're protective and stuff.
00:18:40,00:18:41,"But if it was opened to the elements at the time,"
00:18:41,00:18:43,the bounce could be variable.
00:18:43,00:18:44,"It's more lighty to be lower and slower,"
00:18:44,00:18:45,so you'd be more lighty to take one.
00:18:45,00:18:47,And the plums than in the noggin.
00:18:49,00:18:54,"- Yeah, about 1850s was the Palner's patent-growing protector, as it was called,"
00:18:54,00:18:56,before that you'd just stuff a hanky down there to improvise it.
00:18:56,00:18:58,But it was only in the 1970s.
00:18:58,00:19:00,- It was your hanky made out of Kevlar or what?
00:19:00,00:19:01,- Thank you.
00:19:01,00:19:02,"- Yeah, yeah."
00:19:02,00:19:04,"- But if it isn't very well used, hanky,"
00:19:04,00:19:05,I think that can actually...
00:19:05,00:19:07,(laughing)
00:19:07,00:19:09,- It's hard to fold.
00:19:09,00:19:13,- A heavy head cold actually does protect you
00:19:13,00:19:16,"in unpredictable ways, yeah."
00:19:16,00:19:18,"And if there's any you could ever use the same one as a kind of gumbee hanky,"
00:19:18,00:19:19,it's the first crooked helmet at the same time.
00:19:19,00:19:21,(laughing)
00:19:21,00:19:22,- It's so slanky tied and it's gone.
00:19:22,00:19:25,- Would you have a commentate on Cricket?
00:19:25,00:19:26,"Well, I hope you'd done it."
00:19:26,00:19:29,- I think I have done online just briefly.
00:19:29,00:19:33,"Yeah, it's quite, it's quite awesome responsibility to be perfectly honest."
00:19:33,00:19:35,"If you're thinking, the other people can't see it, and I've really got to..."
00:19:35,00:19:36,- Yeah.
00:19:36,00:19:37,"- You know, like when you say to the drive in the left,"
00:19:37,00:19:38,"it's like, I can't see my left shoulder."
00:19:38,00:19:40,Can you tell me if there's anything coming down that hill?
00:19:40,00:19:41,(laughing)
00:19:41,00:19:43,"It's that sort of pressure, but for hours."
00:19:43,00:19:44,- It's days.
00:19:44,00:19:45,"- I mean, these people can be, you know,"
00:19:45,00:19:46,they can be sort of several countries where
00:19:46,00:19:48,and I've got to describe what's going on.
00:19:48,00:19:50,I think it's more high pressure work than people imagine.
00:19:50,00:19:52,"- Well, I did read a description of what it's like"
00:19:52,00:19:54,commentating on something like Test Match Special.
00:19:54,00:19:55,I can't remember who it was who did it.
00:19:55,00:19:57,"Well, like one of the famous commentators said,"
00:19:57,00:20:00,"""Look, this is the apex of human civilization."
00:20:00,00:20:03,"""You're sitting observing a nice cricket match happening."
00:20:03,00:20:05,"""People are sending in homemade cakes to you,"
00:20:05,00:20:08,"""which you can then review on there during a lull in play, basically."""
00:20:08,00:20:09,- That the whole play is a lull.
00:20:09,00:20:10,- Yeah.
00:20:10,00:20:12,There's a sort of breathing space.
00:20:12,00:20:13,"It's not like commentating on tennis or something like that,"
00:20:13,00:20:14,"which must be, you know."
00:20:14,00:20:16,- Have you a radio commentator for tennis?
00:20:16,00:20:18,That's a horse racing or whatever.
00:20:18,00:20:19,- Exactly.
00:20:19,00:20:21,"- You know, your word per minute is just--"
00:20:21,00:20:23,"- Exactly, yeah, yeah, I've seen them."
00:20:23,00:20:25,"- But this is, he was saying, I think it was a he."
00:20:25,00:20:30,"You were either having to describe the immediate play,"
00:20:30,00:20:32,"which like if there's something going on,"
00:20:32,00:20:34,"you need to explain that really clearly to the listener,"
00:20:34,00:20:36,"like he was saying, and then during the quieter bits,"
00:20:36,00:20:38,you're talking more about the overall shape of the game.
00:20:38,00:20:39,"And during the really quiet bits,"
00:20:39,00:20:42,he's talking about the grounds and the whole history
00:20:42,00:20:43,of cricket.
00:20:43,00:20:44,And so you've got three different modes
00:20:44,00:20:47,that you can switch between to a depending on what.
00:20:47,00:20:48,"- Oh, you've got mode full, which is something"
00:20:48,00:20:50,completely unrelated.
00:20:50,00:20:51,"Have you guys ever seen the clip of,"
00:20:51,00:20:54,it's the Australian commentator and he tells the joke
00:20:54,00:20:57,"that it's a Nicknack party work, give the frog a loan."
00:20:57,00:20:58,- Right.
00:20:58,00:20:59,"- Look at Daniel, is that a Keith?"
00:20:59,00:21:01,"- It's a Keith, it's Kerrio Keith."
00:21:01,00:21:04,"And he's, and I can't, who he's commentating with,"
00:21:04,00:21:05,but there's always a straight man
00:21:05,00:21:06,who's actually commentating on the cricket
00:21:06,00:21:08,"and then, you know, someone more joking."
00:21:08,00:21:10,And he's trying to tell this very long joke
00:21:10,00:21:12,and the other commentator is trying to get in the way
00:21:12,00:21:14,and explain what's happening in the cricket.
00:21:14,00:21:15,"And then every two minutes he says,"
00:21:15,00:21:16,"""And there's no run."""
00:21:16,00:21:19,(laughter)
00:21:19,00:21:21,- That's where you use your elbow to test the temperature
00:21:21,00:21:24,"of bath water, for instance, rather than your fingers aren't"
00:21:24,00:21:25,actually very sensitive to people with their hands
00:21:25,00:21:27,"and go, ""That's okay, but it's not actually..."""
00:21:27,00:21:29,- I feel like my hands are sensitive to temperature.
00:21:29,00:21:30,- I thought it was that your elbow is the
00:21:30,00:21:32,bit of you that's most like a baby.
00:21:32,00:21:34,"- 'Cause I always wear gloves, I always wear gloves"
00:21:34,00:21:36,"when it's cold, I don't wear elbow patches."
00:21:36,00:21:37,"- Oh, you should do it."
00:21:37,00:21:39,- You lose so much heat through your elbows.
00:21:39,00:21:41,"- Yeah, yeah, but you're only, yeah."
00:21:41,00:21:42,"- But also you're down the skatepark a lot,"
00:21:42,00:21:44,you're called protective equipment.
00:21:44,00:21:45,So they're elbow guards.
00:21:45,00:21:47,You just don't think of them as well.
00:21:47,00:21:48,- Of course.
00:21:48,00:21:50,- What's the sport wear?
00:21:50,00:21:51,"It's two villages versus another,"
00:21:51,00:21:53,and it doesn't seem to be a limit on another.
00:21:53,00:21:55,And it's basically getting a ball from...
00:21:55,00:21:56,- Yeah.
00:21:56,00:21:57,- Two posts or something like that.
00:21:57,00:21:58,- Something that's getting from one thing.
00:21:58,00:22:00,- Oppies versus the Downies or opposite of the Downers.
00:22:00,00:22:03,"And it's just like village football, really."
00:22:03,00:22:05,- But there's no limit on numbers on the Down.
00:22:05,00:22:07,"- Well, I think these days the police limit"
00:22:07,00:22:08,who can go.
00:22:08,00:22:10,(laughter)
00:22:10,00:22:10,- Yeah.
00:22:10,00:22:13,"- I mean, those sort of sports wear"
00:22:13,00:22:14,there's a flexibility.
00:22:14,00:22:15,Like how did it go?
00:22:15,00:22:18,"La Cross, there's a sort of set length,"
00:22:18,00:22:21,or parameters within which the length of a lacrosse pitch
00:22:21,00:22:23,"must be, but actually there is no side boundary."
00:22:23,00:22:25,That's entirely based on where you happen to be playing.
00:22:25,00:22:26,- Yeah.
00:22:26,00:22:27,"- So you can set off running in wonder,"
00:22:27,00:22:28,and you can just keep going until there's an obstacle.
00:22:28,00:22:30,"Essentially, that doesn't get out."
00:22:30,00:22:31,"- Yeah, yeah, you can do that."
00:22:31,00:22:32,- We used to do that at school.
00:22:32,00:22:34,And I play football in the playground.
00:22:34,00:22:35,"You would have one goal,"
00:22:35,00:22:38,and you'd have two teams shooting towards the same goal.
00:22:38,00:22:39,And you would just get someone who would get the ball
00:22:39,00:22:42,I'd just run in the complete opposite direction
00:22:42,00:22:44,with the ball so everyone had to chase after them.
00:22:44,00:22:48,"- It's quite, 'cause there's no boundaries."
00:22:48,00:22:50,- But that is true in official lacrosse rules.
00:22:50,00:22:51,I think it's just women's lacrosse.
00:22:51,00:22:53,"I weirdly, I think men's lacrosse does have boundaries,"
00:22:53,00:22:54,but women's lacrosse--
00:22:54,00:22:55,- Men need boundaries.
00:22:55,00:22:56,(laughter)
00:22:56,00:22:57,- It's good indeed.
00:22:57,00:23:00,- Wasn't it something about like the earliest games
00:23:00,00:23:02,of lacrosse had an insane number of people?
00:23:02,00:23:05,- The American lacrosse foundation claims
00:23:05,00:23:07,"the earliest games could have over 100,000 players."
00:23:07,00:23:08,- Stop it.
00:23:09,00:23:11,- And try commentating on that.
00:23:11,00:23:13,- Or state of those changing rooms as well.
00:23:13,00:23:15,(laughter)
00:23:15,00:23:17,- But it's like the handshake before the game is going to take--
00:23:17,00:23:19,(laughter)
00:23:19,00:23:21,"- But it's a sort of roughly tafty sport in America,"
00:23:21,00:23:22,"I think, isn't it, LaCrosse?"
00:23:22,00:23:25,We might associate LaCrosse with sort of girls'
00:23:25,00:23:26,boarding schools.
00:23:26,00:23:27,- Yeah.
00:23:27,00:23:28,"- In America, then it'd be--"
00:23:28,00:23:33,"- Well, 'cause women's lacrosse and men's lacrosse"
00:23:33,00:23:34,"are like just different games, aren't they?"
00:23:34,00:23:36,"- Yeah. - They have different rules, different."
00:23:36,00:23:37,"- Yeah, totally different."
00:23:37,00:23:38,- But you wouldn't hear phrases like
00:23:38,00:23:41,"roughty tafty in the men's lacrosse that they play in America,"
00:23:41,00:23:44,"for instance, whereas you might in the female boarding school"
00:23:44,00:23:45,across the replay here.
00:23:45,00:23:47,I've never heard roughty tafty before.
00:23:47,00:23:48,"- Well, why not exist as a different--"
00:23:48,00:23:49,"- No, the phrase. - No, the phrase."
00:23:49,00:23:50,"- No, the phrase."
00:23:50,00:23:51,"- No, no, no."
00:23:51,00:23:51,- Some sort of post-surgery.
00:23:51,00:23:52,(laughter)
00:23:52,00:23:55,- Even if it's a bubble that's a dessert.
00:23:55,00:23:58,"- Oh, then animals, golden hamsters can navigate their way home,"
00:23:58,00:24:00,even when blindfolded and let it a complicated route
00:24:00,00:24:01,away from their nests.
00:24:01,00:24:02,- Can they? How do they do it?
00:24:02,00:24:03,Do we know?
00:24:03,00:24:06,"- No,, I don't think we do know."
00:24:06,00:24:07,"- Oh, and it's really mysterious, isn't it?"
00:24:07,00:24:09,"Because it's, you know, some of these senses are not,"
00:24:09,00:24:10,we don't fully understand.
00:24:10,00:24:11,"So there's a thing called the,"
00:24:11,00:24:13,"oh, it's called the Reed Warbler bird."
00:24:13,00:24:14,"- Oh, yeah."
00:24:14,00:24:17,"- And the scientists wanted to disrupt,"
00:24:17,00:24:19,they thought they must be using the Earth's magnetic field.
00:24:19,00:24:20,"Okay, so we'll disrupt it."
00:24:20,00:24:24,So they attached small magnets to these birds' foreheads
00:24:24,00:24:24,"in an experiment,"
00:24:24,00:24:26,and they also blocked their view of the stars.
00:24:26,00:24:29,"And, obviously, they couldn't navigate."
00:24:29,00:24:30,(laughter)
00:24:30,00:24:31,I don't really know what that proves.
00:24:31,00:24:32,(laughter)
00:24:32,00:24:35,- The homing pigeons used to use in the war
00:24:35,00:24:37,to work out where sort of various ships were in things.
00:24:37,00:24:38,Because they had their homing instincts.
00:24:38,00:24:41,And they would know that they would fly
00:24:41,00:24:43,at a very particular pace.
00:24:43,00:24:44,And they would know what time they were released.
00:24:44,00:24:45,"And so they're there for,"
00:24:45,00:24:47,and the angle from which they basically arrived.
00:24:47,00:24:50,They could work out how far away from that distance.
00:24:50,00:24:51,- Really?
00:24:51,00:24:52,- You'd work out the maths backwards.
00:24:52,00:24:54,So they've arrived from over there.
00:24:54,00:24:55,They set off at this time.
00:24:55,00:24:56,"So they must have there for,"
00:24:56,00:24:57,that's the way they work.
00:24:57,00:24:58,- I usually have a 20-hour.
00:24:58,00:25:00,- But how do they know where they set off from?
00:25:00,00:25:02,- 'Cause they're going to note on them.
00:25:02,00:25:04,"- Oh, what time they set off?"
00:25:04,00:25:06,"- Well, that information must be,"
00:25:06,00:25:07,"yes, I was going to say that must be radio,"
00:25:07,00:25:08,but then presumably the people radioing
00:25:08,00:25:10,and say where they were.
00:25:10,00:25:11,"But maybe, maybe there's so many internet."
00:25:11,00:25:12,Maybe everything.
00:25:12,00:25:14,Any radio signal you send can be intercepted.
00:25:14,00:25:15,"But I'm not going to tell you where we are,"
00:25:15,00:25:17,but it's 7.58 and I'm releasing the pigeon.
00:25:17,00:25:18,"- Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:25:18,00:25:20,- And then it's making that what you will.
00:25:20,00:25:21,(laughter)
00:25:21,00:25:22,"- Good luck with that, yeah."
00:25:22,00:25:25,"- Oh, Keith has gone off on one."
00:25:25,00:25:27,They were genuinely useful.
00:25:27,00:25:28,"They were, they were, they were,"
00:25:28,00:25:29,they were sort of called up.
00:25:29,00:25:31,People that were sort of looked after pigeons
00:25:31,00:25:32,"were suddenly, they would, they were,"
00:25:32,00:25:33,they hide him on for them.
00:25:33,00:25:36,"- Yeah, suddenly we went from complete weirdo loners"
00:25:36,00:25:39,"to very sought after people, I'm so sorry."
00:25:39,00:25:40,- Oh my God.
00:25:40,00:25:42,"- That's not how I feel about pigeon fancies, really."
00:25:42,00:25:44,- For our audience are in the pigeon loft at the moment.
00:25:44,00:25:45,- I know.
00:25:45,00:25:45,"- Yeah, yeah."
00:25:45,00:25:48,- I've got on satire.
00:25:48,00:25:51,"You know, tatler, we're all subscribers."
00:25:51,00:25:52,- Of course.
00:25:52,00:25:52,- Yeah.
00:25:52,00:25:54,- That was meant to be satirical.
00:25:54,00:25:55,(laughter)
00:25:55,00:25:56,It was meant to be taking the piss out of you.
00:25:56,00:25:57,- Can you explain what it is?
00:25:57,00:25:58,- Sorry for those of us.
00:25:58,00:25:59,- Sorry.
00:25:59,00:26:00,- We grew up in Bolton.
00:26:00,00:26:02,- Sorry.
00:26:02,00:26:03,It's really not your area.
00:26:03,00:26:05,"- Right, world of interiors, but about people."
00:26:05,00:26:07,(laughter)
00:26:07,00:26:09,"- So yes, tatler for international listeners"
00:26:09,00:26:11,and anyone who's more civilized
00:26:11,00:26:14,is basically a magazine for high society.
00:26:14,00:26:17,It's like photographs of people who aren't quite
00:26:17,00:26:19,"the royal family, 'cause they probably can't get access"
00:26:19,00:26:21,"to them, but who are mates with the royal family."
00:26:21,00:26:22,"- Right, so."
00:26:22,00:26:23,- Having wedding.
00:26:23,00:26:25,"- Is it tatler that's got, sort of on the back page,"
00:26:25,00:26:27,"there's always like a, it's not a high street honey,"
00:26:27,00:26:30,"but it's kind of a, it's like an eligible young lady"
00:26:30,00:26:32,who is engaged.
00:26:32,00:26:33,"I think maybe that's it, is like,"
00:26:33,00:26:34,look at this beautiful young woman.
00:26:34,00:26:35,She's just gone engaged.
00:26:35,00:26:36,You can't get together with her.
00:26:36,00:26:36,"- Oh, right."
00:26:36,00:26:37,- Is that it?
00:26:37,00:26:38,"- Probably about, yeah."
00:26:38,00:26:40,"I mean, it doesn't sound like any other magazine would have that."
00:26:40,00:26:42,"- Yeah, like Country Life has a sort of,"
00:26:42,00:26:44,"yeah, it's made like a lady of the month."
00:26:44,00:26:45,"- Maybe it's Country Life, I'm not talking about that."
00:26:45,00:26:48,"- But yes, it's a sort of that with an RT black and white photo."
00:26:48,00:26:49,- Yes.
00:26:49,00:26:51,- And sometimes I think it's like single-hand looking.
00:26:51,00:26:52,- Really?
00:26:52,00:26:54,- And free available in your area.
00:26:54,00:26:55,"- Oh, that kind of thing, isn't it?"
00:26:55,00:26:57,- So this is the page three of...
00:26:57,00:27:00,"- Except it's page like 128, 'cause of all the adverts"
00:27:00,00:27:01,for posh watches.
00:27:01,00:27:01,"- Yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:27:01,00:27:02,- And it's a monthly publication.
00:27:02,00:27:04,So it doesn't work in the way that's sort of Metro used to have
00:27:04,00:27:06,"our eyes saw yesterday on the 802 from Voxelore,"
00:27:06,00:27:08,"but we're like, I think I saw you back."
00:27:08,00:27:09,"Must have been, I must have been up for four months ago."
00:27:09,00:27:11,(laughing)
00:27:11,00:27:12,I think you admired my plowing.
00:27:12,00:27:14,(laughing)
00:27:14,00:27:14,- That's disgusting.
00:27:14,00:27:15,- I was.
00:27:15,00:27:16,"- Oh, yeah."
00:27:16,00:27:17,- Rude of me.
00:27:17,00:27:18,- Yeah.
00:27:18,00:27:20,"- Yeah, so what about time?"
00:27:20,00:27:20,"- Oh, yeah, sorry."
00:27:20,00:27:23,It was founded by a guy called Richard Steele
00:27:23,00:27:26,who called himself Isaac Bickerstaff
00:27:26,00:27:27,"when he edited ""Tatler"""
00:27:27,00:27:29,"and Isaac Bickerstaff, actually."
00:27:29,00:27:30,You'll remember the name James.
00:27:30,00:27:31,"- I do know the name, but why?"
00:27:31,00:27:36,"- It was because Jonathan Swift, once published in 1708,"
00:27:36,00:27:38,"so another great, the other great probably satirist"
00:27:38,00:27:41,"at the time, published the ""Almania"" predictions of the year,"
00:27:41,00:27:44,writing as Isaac Bickerstaff and he predicted the death
00:27:44,00:27:48,of this astrologer and society person called John Partridge.
00:27:48,00:27:51,"And he predicted it on April 1st, it was an April 4th joke."
00:27:51,00:27:52,"And this poor guy John Partridge,"
00:27:52,00:27:54,"who was a bit of a butt of jokes,"
00:27:54,00:27:56,spent the rest of his life trying to convince people
00:27:56,00:27:59,that he wasn't dead and when this turned up.
00:27:59,00:28:02,"And he wrote a letter saying, I'm not dead."
00:28:02,00:28:04,"And Jonathan Swift said, well, that's a hoax"
00:28:04,00:28:07,"'cause he is, you know, seeing the body made."
00:28:07,00:28:07,- Yeah.
00:28:07,00:28:09,"- It was an unkind time, a lot of sick burns"
00:28:09,00:28:11,"being dished out all over the place,"
00:28:11,00:28:12,"like saying one of the Irish are so hungry,"
00:28:12,00:28:14,"why don't they just eat their babies,"
00:28:14,00:28:15,which was during the famine.
00:28:15,00:28:17,It was incredibly harsh satir.
00:28:17,00:28:19,- Right.
00:28:19,00:28:20,"- Imagine that, imagine that,"
00:28:20,00:28:23,"'cause it sounds bad now, but it doesn't really love the famine."
00:28:23,00:28:24,"- Yeah, yeah, yeah, no."
00:28:24,00:28:25,- It's actually even worse.
00:28:25,00:28:26,"- It's pitch black, exactly."
00:28:26,00:28:28,He's trying to draw attention to the famine.
00:28:28,00:28:30,"And, you know, the awful cruelty that has caused it."
00:28:30,00:28:31,"But he's, you know,"
00:28:31,00:28:33,he's doing those through a reading process.
00:28:33,00:28:34,"- These days, there's not enough nuance on Twitter"
00:28:34,00:28:35,for people to get that.
00:28:35,00:28:37,I don't think he'd be able to have done it today.
00:28:37,00:28:39,- So there's a foremost satirist of your time
00:28:39,00:28:41,"and it's just to be considered an age lord,"
00:28:41,00:28:42,but he actually is a brutal guy.
00:28:42,00:28:44,"It's nuanced, for heaven's sake."
00:28:44,00:28:46,(laughing)
00:28:46,00:28:48,"- One of you try, we're doing down the people."
00:28:48,00:28:49,I want one of you to tweet something
00:28:49,00:28:53,about a group of people eating babies today
00:28:53,00:28:54,and see what happens to you.
00:28:54,00:28:56,- I'm not on Twitter.
00:28:56,00:28:57,"So, one of you two will--"
00:28:57,00:28:59,"- On Twitter, we'll go down and storm these days."
00:28:59,00:29:01,I can show you that in a group of news.
00:29:01,00:29:02,- I could put it in a WhatsApp group.
00:29:02,00:29:05,(laughing)
00:29:05,00:29:06,- Just see.
00:29:06,00:29:07,- Yeah.
00:29:07,00:29:08,"- Yeah, the Christmas one's gone quite."
00:29:08,00:29:10,(laughing)
00:29:10,00:29:11,- Just out of the blue.
00:29:11,00:29:13,"- Oh, what's Mars up to?"
00:29:13,00:29:15,"- Oh, what are we thinking this year?"
00:29:15,00:29:18,"- Another pseudonym, John Barron."
00:29:18,00:29:19,Do you know this one?
00:29:19,00:29:20,"- No, Barron."
00:29:20,00:29:21,- How do you know the name Barron?
00:29:21,00:29:22,- Barron. - Barron.
00:29:22,00:29:24,"- Or Barron, like, Barron."
00:29:24,00:29:26,- B-A-D-L-R-O-N.
00:29:26,00:29:27,- The Barron Knights.
00:29:27,00:29:28,- She's a famous Barron these days.
00:29:28,00:29:29,- Barron Trump.
00:29:29,00:29:30,- Yes.
00:29:30,00:29:32,"So, Donald Trump pseudonym, John Barron."
00:29:32,00:29:37,"So, when Forbes were doing the richest people list,"
00:29:37,00:29:39,"John Barron wrote to them saying,"
00:29:39,00:29:40,"""Oh, you've got to put Trump in here."""
00:29:40,00:29:41,He's a billionaire.
00:29:41,00:29:42,- No.
00:29:42,00:29:43,"- Yeah, and he's got a few others."
00:29:43,00:29:46,"There's a guy called John Miller,"
00:29:46,00:29:48,"who once wrote to People Magazine,"
00:29:48,00:29:51,"who'd said something about Trump saying actually,"
00:29:51,00:29:53,Trump is a very compassionate husband.
00:29:53,00:29:56,And lots of beautiful women are always asking to go out with him.
00:29:56,00:29:59,"In fact, Madonna called and wanted to go out with him."
00:29:59,00:30:00,That I could tell you.
00:30:00,00:30:02,- But what makes you think that's one of his pseudonyms?
00:30:02,00:30:04,"- We, it came out in court later."
00:30:04,00:30:06,"- Oh, that's amazing, that's it."
00:30:06,00:30:09,(upbeat music)
00:30:09,00:30:13,"- Okay, that's it."
00:30:13,00:30:15,That is all of our outtakes.
