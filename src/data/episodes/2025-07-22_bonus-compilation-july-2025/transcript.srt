 [MUSIC]

2
00:00:04,320 --> 00:00:08,240
 Hey Clubfish members, welcome to your secret bonus bit of content.

3
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:10,000
 We've got a compilation for you today.

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:14,320
 This is the best of the outtakes of things that didn't make it to the main show.

5
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:17,040
 It features me, James, Andy, and Anna.

6
00:00:17,040 --> 00:00:19,920
 But you've got some bonus voices joining us this week.

7
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:25,440
 We've got Reese Darby, the brilliant Reese, and of course, the excellent Miles Jupp.

8
00:00:25,440 --> 00:00:27,360
 You will have heard them on recent episodes.

9
00:00:27,360 --> 00:00:32,000
 And this is all the stuff that didn't quite fit into the main episodes.

10
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:36,560
 Oh and quickly before we get into it, just a quick thank you to everyone who came to the Crosswise festival.

11
00:00:36,560 --> 00:00:38,000
 We had such a fun gig.

12
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,680
 There was an awesome ending to it where we did a quiz with members from the audience.

13
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:43,360
 It was just so much fun.

14
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:45,200
 So thank you everyone who came.

15
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:48,640
 There's some people traveled all the way from America to come see the show.

16
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:50,400
 Hope you enjoyed it.

17
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:54,080
 And if anyone else wants to come and see us do another live show,

18
00:00:54,080 --> 00:00:56,800
 we're returning to the London Podcast Festival.

19
00:00:56,800 --> 00:00:59,840
 We're going to be there on the 5th and 6th of September.

20
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:03,280
 We've got a couple of great guests lined up to join us on stage.

21
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:05,280
 Go to know such thing as a fish.com.

22
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:06,720
 You'll find the links there.

23
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:08,320
 Come and see us live.

24
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:11,840
 And I believe that there's going to be online streaming as well.

25
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:14,320
 So if you are overseas and you want to watch it,

26
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:18,800
 do check it out and buy your tickets to watch it online as it happens live.

27
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:23,280
 Last thing to mention is if you miss last week's drop us a line,

28
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:26,960
 just to let you know that the price of club fish is going up by 1 pound.

29
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:30,560
 So it is going to be 3 pounds 99 going forward.

30
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:31,760
 Hope that's okay with you all.

31
00:01:31,760 --> 00:01:35,680
 We promise that we're going to continue to put out really fun formats.

32
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:37,200
 So don't go anywhere.

33
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:39,200
 And don't go anywhere right now because here we go.

34
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:40,480
 It's the compilation.

35
00:01:40,480 --> 00:01:44,080
 The four fishers recent miles on with the outtakes.

36
00:01:44,080 --> 00:02:06,320
 - There's a world one connection,

37
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:08,080
 as well as a world two connection in ugly.

38
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:10,640
 Which is really cool actually.

39
00:02:10,640 --> 00:02:13,760
 So in world one, there was an understandable fear that the Germans

40
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:15,440
 were going to invade via Essex.

41
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:20,480
 And a plan was drawn up to evacuate the whole of Essex to Oxfordshire.

42
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:21,920
 1.4 million people.

43
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:24,000
 I don't think they told the people of Oxfordshire.

44
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,640
 - Yeah, you were, what do you hear? - You didn't mention it.

45
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:27,760
 There's going to be some stuff happening.

46
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:29,200
 Just don't worry about it.

47
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:30,720
 Just keep your door shut.

48
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:33,760
 But they all got these, you know, things from the council saying

49
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:35,440
 this is what to do.

50
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:37,280
 - Councils have really diminished over there.

51
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:39,520
 They're like now they sometimes can't collect glass.

52
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:43,920
 Well, there's the undefonding, isn't it? We don't get the war anymore.

53
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:48,880
 And the information said, when ugly church bells ring incessantly,

54
00:02:48,880 --> 00:02:51,760
 that's your sign, get out, goes to Oxfordshire.

55
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:55,280
 And they also, and they were told destroy all alcohol

56
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:58,720
 because if the Germans arrive and they're invading

57
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:03,360
 and they get drunk, that's even worse than a sober invading Nazi.

58
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:04,400
 Which is quite weird.

59
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:06,080
 - Really, that is weird because didn't,

60
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:08,720
 wasn't the battle of fishguard when the French came over?

61
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:12,960
 In the 18th century, the last time Britain was invaded at all.

62
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:15,680
 They arrived, they all got drunk and couldn't do anything.

63
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:17,120
 - Well, I think it's really on the fence.

64
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:19,280
 Yes, will alcohol make the invaders worse or better?

65
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:21,280
 And maybe it depends on whether they're French or German.

66
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:22,000
 - Oh, yeah, maybe.

67
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:26,480
 But anyway, it's really cool because everyone was given

68
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:27,920
 these evacuation routes.

69
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:29,520
 And it meant you had to take all the back roads

70
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:31,680
 because the army would be using the main roads.

71
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:34,880
 So they had these maps and there were arrows all over Essex

72
00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:37,040
 painted on walls and trees and lamp posts

73
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:39,840
 and big white arrows showing people the way.

74
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:43,440
 And the only remnant that remains now is in Ugly.

75
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:47,360
 There's a wall which just has now only the little plaque left saying

76
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:50,800
 this is where the big white arrow was saying, "Get out of door."

77
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:53,600
 Imagine arriving as a Nazi going, "Where is everyone?"

78
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:56,400
 And then seeing giant arrows pointing at you towards

79
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:58,560
 where you needed to go.

80
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:02,000
 - We haven't got this through, Winston.

81
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:05,840
 Protesters have some good gear.

82
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:08,000
 Like I was looking at Stanstead protests.

83
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,080
 So there was a protest in Stanstead a few years ago

84
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:14,400
 over a bunch of migrants who were being sent away

85
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:16,800
 and that one of those taken in the dead of night

86
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:19,600
 stuck on a charter plane sent back to the country

87
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:22,480
 from which they'd come from a while ago.

88
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:24,160
 Big protest about that.

89
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:28,160
 But the way they did it was they formed a circle around the plane.

90
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:29,200
 So they got bought cutters.

91
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:30,800
 They got into Stanstead Airport.

92
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:32,720
 They formed a circle around the plane

93
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:35,120
 and they locked themselves in this circle

94
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:39,600
 by putting their arms in pipes filled with expanding foam

95
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:41,120
 and attaching their arms to each other.

96
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:42,800
 So I put my arm in one end of the pipe

97
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:44,320
 and he puts his arm in the other.

98
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:45,840
 Where you get it, what does it expand?

99
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:48,160
 - It's almost like you know those Chinese finger traps

100
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:49,440
 that you put your fingers in,

101
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:50,880
 but like a super big version of that.

102
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:52,480
 - Exactly, it's a giant one of those.

103
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:53,360
 - What if I need a piss?

104
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:55,520
 - Well, you can't, you just have to go loose.

105
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:56,480
 You can't hold your willy.

106
00:04:56,480 --> 00:04:59,680
 - So sorry, you're in a big circle with your arms in the pipes.

107
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:00,480
 Or our fingers touching.

108
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:02,960
 - If you want to be happy.

109
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:03,760
 - Possibly not.

110
00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:06,400
 - I don't think they, I think you don't want them touching

111
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:08,320
 because you could have a wider circumference

112
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:09,440
 if you're not touching.

113
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:10,240
 - What do you mean?

114
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:11,120
 - Oh yeah, true.

115
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:13,120
 - But what if I feel lonely or scared?

116
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:15,760
 - No, I do want to be holding hands with someone.

117
00:05:15,760 --> 00:05:18,560
 - They're the sacrifices you make to save these things.

118
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:20,000
 - Someone else can't even help me have a piss

119
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,520
 because they've got their arms in the kitchen.

120
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:23,600
 - Well, there's got to be, I've got it.

121
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:24,960
 There's got to be an external agent

122
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:27,120
 who's free to go around helping people have a piss.

123
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:28,560
 - There was one piss helper, yes.

124
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:32,320
 - What do we need to do then is arrest the piss assistant

125
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:34,480
 and then the whole protest falls apart.

126
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:38,640
 - Yeah, they all wet themselves and it's over.

127
00:05:38,640 --> 00:05:40,240
 - And that's how all protests tend.

128
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:41,840
 - I need the toilet, let's go.

129
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:43,840
 I've wet myself, we're done for the day.

130
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:44,880
 - How did it end then?

131
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:47,040
 How did they actually un-tube them?

132
00:05:47,040 --> 00:05:47,840
 - They're still there.

133
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:48,800
 - They're still there.

134
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:49,760
 - They're still there.

135
00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:51,440
 - I've claimed stuck in the middle.

136
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:54,640
 They tried to prosecute them on.

137
00:05:54,640 --> 00:05:56,480
 Some, actually, anti-terrorism charges

138
00:05:56,480 --> 00:05:57,760
 before our judge a couple of years ago.

139
00:05:57,760 --> 00:05:59,040
 So that's fucking ridiculous.

140
00:05:59,040 --> 00:06:00,240
 These guys aren't terrorists.

141
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:02,720
 But they were extracted from the pipes first.

142
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:04,480
 I don't think anyone's still walking around with the pipes.

143
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:05,200
 - Catch their arms.

144
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:09,600
 - If you are writing, oh, you can't, probably.

145
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:12,480
 - If your piss helper is free,

146
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:14,160
 they ask if they can drop us a line.

147
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:19,840
 - Is a stanza to Gatwick that's won the award for best toilet

148
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:20,880
 like multiple years?

149
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:22,240
 - I can't be stanced at.

150
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:22,800
 - No?

151
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:26,880
 - Unless they're talking about the entire app policy

152
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:27,600
 for the toilet.

153
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:29,680
 - Is it, can I ask that?

154
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:32,480
 Is it an individual cubicle or is it a design of toilet?

155
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:33,680
 - No, no, it's the whole toilet.

156
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:34,560
 It's the cleanliness.

157
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:37,440
 It's in the window as you go down into the toilets.

158
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:38,800
 You know, you walked in and go, wow.

159
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:40,720
 - Wait, there's a window as you go down to the toilet.

160
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:42,080
 - Yeah, it's a little cabinet where they keep it.

161
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:44,240
 - It's a viewing, does your toilet have a viewing though?

162
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:45,440
 - It should.

163
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:52,480
 - Can I give you a music recommendation related to this fact?

164
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:53,280
 - Yes, please.

165
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:54,720
 - It's my favorite song I found recently.

166
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:57,200
 So in 1978, for sure, some listeners remember,

167
00:06:57,200 --> 00:06:59,520
 there was the big frequency change

168
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:01,360
 where all of the radio stations in the UK,

169
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:02,640
 all the big BBC ones,

170
00:07:02,640 --> 00:07:04,080
 hops to a different frequency

171
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:06,800
 because of e-regulations.

172
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:09,120
 And no one had the internet then.

173
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:10,880
 So it was like, how are they going to know

174
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:12,960
 that their station is at a different frequency,

175
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:14,720
 especially given that.

176
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:17,280
 I believe Radio 3 hopped the frequency

177
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:18,960
 that used to be Radio 1.

178
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:21,760
 So you'd tune in hoping for Tony Blackburn

179
00:07:21,760 --> 00:07:23,440
 and you'd get, in certain name,

180
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:26,720
 with famous Radio 3 presenter in the 1970s.

181
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:28,320
 - I honestly thought the Tony Blackburn

182
00:07:28,320 --> 00:07:29,920
 was currently on Radio 3 with you.

183
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:32,640
 - He might be, he might be.

184
00:07:32,640 --> 00:07:34,560
 And the only reason I know it's him is because

185
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:36,320
 one of the things they did to tell people was

186
00:07:36,320 --> 00:07:40,880
 Tony Blackburn stayed at Radio 3 for the day to tell people

187
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:42,160
 a bit like if you move house,

188
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:44,480
 you stay at the house that you've just moved out of.

189
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:46,400
 So when your mates come around, you can go,

190
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:47,680
 "I don't live here anymore."

191
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:49,200
 So if you tuned in, he'd be like,

192
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:50,400
 "Hello, it's me, Tony.

193
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:51,680
 I'm not here anymore, though."

194
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:52,880
 - That's not confusing at all.

195
00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:54,720
 - Go to the stage.

196
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:56,800
 - Well, they get someone else to say,

197
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:58,240
 Tony doesn't live here anymore.

198
00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:00,720
 - If you want him, he's on Radio 1.

199
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:02,080
 - It's just a dedicated guy.

200
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:03,680
 - That's great, that's so good.

201
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:05,920
 - It was also this incredible song

202
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:08,000
 by the King Singers, who are very famous

203
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,560
 at the time, Accapella Group from King's College Cambridge.

204
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:12,800
 They released a single to help people remember

205
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:14,160
 all the new frequencies.

206
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:16,720
 And you've got to look at that.

207
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:17,840
 It's beautiful.

208
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:20,480
 It starts, just I'll just give you the first line.

209
00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:23,360
 A new international agreement comes into effect.

210
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:26,240
 And many of the frequencies used for the BBC

211
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:29,040
 will be changed at a time.

212
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:30,800
 I think it was unlike that.

213
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:32,800
 - Is that the tune, or are you just riff that?

214
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:34,240
 - It's a bit like that.

215
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:36,240
 It's like, Accapella Church music.

216
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:37,040
 - Wow.

217
00:08:37,040 --> 00:08:39,680
 - But it told everyone what frequencies to go to.

218
00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:41,600
 - I reckon, because it said at a time,

219
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:43,040
 that was a really weird way of saying it.

220
00:08:43,040 --> 00:08:46,480
 But the frequency for Radio 1 was 97 to 99.

221
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:49,280
 So was it that it was a rhyme if that was it?

222
00:08:49,280 --> 00:08:52,080
 - They were actually different frequencies at the time.

223
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:56,640
 And so it's, and there wasn't that much rhyming in this.

224
00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:58,720
 I must say much like a lot of songs.

225
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:01,760
 - The whole point of putting things in a song

226
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:04,240
 to help you remember, is it make them rhyme?

227
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:06,400
 - There's no way it makes it easier whatsoever.

228
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:07,920
 It's just a string of numbers,

229
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:09,200
 somewhere much require boys.

230
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:13,120
 - There were two.

231
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:16,800
 In fact, the world's only two female fighter pilot aces,

232
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:17,840
 which I think to be an ace,

233
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:19,440
 you sort of had to shoot down five planes

234
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:21,360
 or more vaguely varied.

235
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:24,240
 But one of them was this woman called Lillia Litviak,

236
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:26,640
 who was in one of the other regiments

237
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:29,920
 that were flying for the Soviets in the Second World War.

238
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:32,560
 And there was just an account which she recounted

239
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:34,400
 and people who were in the same regiment as her recounted,

240
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:35,760
 which sounds really fun,

241
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:40,320
 where she was in this dogfight with a German called Irvenmeier.

242
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:42,160
 And he'd shot down 12 planes before.

243
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:44,480
 So he was well up there in ace territory.

244
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:47,840
 And she defeated him really resoundingly.

245
00:09:47,840 --> 00:09:49,520
 And then it sounds like there's one of those nice moments

246
00:09:49,520 --> 00:09:51,680
 where he came right down, he was okay.

247
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:55,360
 But he was like, who the hell defeats me?

248
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:59,360
 Introduce me to the man who just bested me.

249
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:01,040
 And so they trotted him up.

250
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:02,000
 Yeah, did you read about this?

251
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,360
 - No, I'm just excited.

252
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:05,120
 - Yeah, go on.

253
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:08,320
 - So he got shot down, but he landed okay or?

254
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:09,760
 - He landed okay in that way.

255
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:11,280
 People seem to sometimes survive.

256
00:10:11,280 --> 00:10:13,840
 And demanded to be taken to the man who shot him down.

257
00:10:13,840 --> 00:10:15,360
 - Yeah, I was so presumptuous.

258
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:16,560
 - I know.

259
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:19,200
 - I just think you don't automatically get to meet the person

260
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:19,840
 who shot you down.

261
00:10:19,840 --> 00:10:23,200
 - That's not my voice for you.

262
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:24,880
 - You've got to follow themselves.

263
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:26,640
 - Yeah, he was pissed off.

264
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:28,080
 He was introduced to a woman, he said,

265
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:29,200
 "Bugger off, guys, come on.

266
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:30,000
 Where's the real guy?

267
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,040
 Stop taking a piss."

268
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:32,320
 - Very funny, okay, yeah.

269
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:34,320
 That happened to Mary Ellis,

270
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:35,440
 who was another of the 88 girls.

271
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:36,720
 She landed a Wellington bomber,

272
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:38,720
 which was a black and huge plane at the time,

273
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:40,000
 at an RAF base.

274
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:43,120
 And the staff said, "Oh great, so where's the pilot?"

275
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:44,720
 And she said, "Oh, I'm the pilot."

276
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:46,640
 And they point blank refused to believe it,

277
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:48,640
 to the extent of searching the plane,

278
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:50,160
 because they thought they were being pranked.

279
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:51,440
 But there's no way this would work.

280
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:54,640
 - And he also does that on just normal domestic flights.

281
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:56,240
 If it's a woman who comes up at the time,

282
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:59,200
 he's like, "Come on, let's get the real one on."

283
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:01,600
 - Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

284
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:04,000
 Dolores Moghrin, she became a pilot after the war.

285
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,240
 She wasn't allowed to say, "This is your captain speaking."

286
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:07,680
 - What? - Because people would freak out

287
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:10,480
 and presumably storm the cockpit or whatever.

288
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:11,840
 - Yes.

289
00:11:11,840 --> 00:11:14,400
 - Can I just say, "I'm never quite sure on airplanes."

290
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:16,080
 When they say, "This is your captain."

291
00:11:16,080 --> 00:11:18,080
 I'm never sure if it's the person who's piloting

292
00:11:18,080 --> 00:11:20,080
 and plane speaking, all the head of the steward

293
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:21,280
 and stewardessing staff.

294
00:11:21,280 --> 00:11:23,280
 - I think it's the captain. - Yeah, it's the person piloting.

295
00:11:23,280 --> 00:11:25,120
 - When they say, "This is the captain speaking,"

296
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:27,120
 generally speaking, it's the captain.

297
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:28,880
 - It's not the stewardess.

298
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:31,280
 - Unless they say, "This is the captain of catering speaking."

299
00:11:31,280 --> 00:11:35,120
 You will receive your cups of tea very shortly.

300
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:38,080
 Just texting at the moment to the airport, actually.

301
00:11:38,080 --> 00:11:39,440
 - There's going to be a little bit of turbulence

302
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:40,880
 on the trolley this afternoon,

303
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:42,960
 but we're going to get your drinks to you.

304
00:11:44,080 --> 00:11:45,840
 - No, who invented Larson Found Officers?

305
00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:48,160
 - Is it someone... - It's my famous.

306
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:49,520
 - Is this guy called Conan Doyle?

307
00:11:49,520 --> 00:11:50,960
 - Winston Doyle. - It's always Conan Doyle.

308
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:52,240
 - Neither of those two.

309
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:54,000
 But it's someone more famous, in fact,

310
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,600
 than either of those two, I would say.

311
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:57,120
 - Thanks to the Winston Churchill. - Genghis Khan.

312
00:11:57,120 --> 00:11:58,400
 - Jesus. - John Wayne.

313
00:11:58,400 --> 00:12:00,400
 - It was Napoleon Donapat.

314
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:02,240
 - Oh, I forgot. - Oh, wow.

315
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:03,200
 - Sorry, Andy.

316
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:04,720
 - Napoleon won? - Yeah.

317
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:05,440
 - I can't even walk.

318
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:06,400
 You're saying he invented now what?

319
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:07,920
 - Larson Found. - Larson Found.

320
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:09,120
 - Yeah. - It's been so long.

321
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:10,240
 - Part of his thing,

322
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:13,600
 like Napoleon was bringing everything to Paris,

323
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:16,960
 kind of thing, like centralising the whole country.

324
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:20,480
 And as part of that, he set up an office on the Yildesitay

325
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:22,880
 for lost objects, and it still exists.

326
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:26,000
 - Cool. - And they have a cabinet of curiosities

327
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,760
 that include several human skulls,

328
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:31,040
 a wooden leg, and two chunks of masonry

329
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:32,320
 from the World Trade Centre.

330
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:34,960
 And can you believe that?

331
00:12:34,960 --> 00:12:36,880
 - Well, that's somehow got lost.

332
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:39,280
 - Yeah. - Well, that's the thing with Larson Found.

333
00:12:39,280 --> 00:12:40,720
 You don't know how it got there, right?

334
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:43,280
 - How do they know the masonry is from the World Trade Centre?

335
00:12:44,080 --> 00:12:45,120
 - There must be clues.

336
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:46,800
 - They've properly analysed that.

337
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:47,600
 Wow.

338
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:48,800
 - I guess so. - That was amazing.

339
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:51,200
 - Yeah. - And the modern system there

340
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:53,840
 was organised by a guy called Louis Lapine,

341
00:12:53,840 --> 00:12:56,800
 who was known as the Little Man with a big stick.

342
00:12:56,800 --> 00:13:00,480
 And he was a French policeman,

343
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:04,160
 and he was well known for handling the crowds in Paris,

344
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:05,600
 whenever there was riots and stuff.

345
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:10,240
 But he was also famous for accusing

346
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:14,000
 friend of the podcast, a polinear of stealing the Mona Lisa.

347
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,920
 Do you remember that story?

348
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:17,120
 - Yeah, and the cast. - And the reason,

349
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:18,320
 I'm sure you're very familiar.

350
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:20,400
 - Yes, this was episode 300.

351
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:21,440
 - He chose what sort of thing.

352
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:22,960
 That was a very good one.

353
00:13:22,960 --> 00:13:24,880
 - I enjoyed that. - I think I was driving

354
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:26,240
 from Patnie.

355
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:28,640
 - He had an accident.

356
00:13:28,640 --> 00:13:32,320
 - But yeah, he was like really famous

357
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:34,080
 and really well respected.

358
00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:34,880
 But when this...

359
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:35,520
 - A big stick.

360
00:13:35,520 --> 00:13:37,120
 - A big stick.

361
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:38,880
 - They had to respect him, yeah.

362
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:40,480
 But when this Mona Lisa thing happened,

363
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:42,240
 he lost all of his credibility, really.

364
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:44,800
 - The police officer, Lapine.

365
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:46,720
 - They say when you've got with the Mona Lisa,

366
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:49,120
 because it's been stolen quite a few times.

367
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:50,160
 But every time,

368
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:53,280
 it doesn't matter where you're coming from to steal it,

369
00:13:53,280 --> 00:13:55,120
 the painting can see you.

370
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:59,440
 - And this is actually a good hint,

371
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:03,040
 the only way to get it without her seeing you

372
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:04,160
 is going from behind.

373
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:06,480
 - And that's the wall.

374
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:09,520
 - Don't take that advice out of context, please.

375
00:14:09,520 --> 00:14:15,680
 - Just on like early trends in general,

376
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:19,360
 have you heard about railway madmen?

377
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:22,240
 - This was a... - Oh, was it like spinoff?

378
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:22,960
 - Yeah.

379
00:14:22,960 --> 00:14:31,520
 - What was that?

380
00:14:31,520 --> 00:14:34,240
 - It was the opening theme.

381
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:39,520
 - This was the thing, when trains were introduced,

382
00:14:39,520 --> 00:14:41,520
 and growing, there was railway mania,

383
00:14:41,520 --> 00:14:43,120
 which was when everyone was just building trains,

384
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:44,800
 across the UK in particular,

385
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:47,680
 with no thought of whether they needed to be a train, basically.

386
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:49,520
 - No, they got given huge subsidies

387
00:14:49,520 --> 00:14:51,200
 for building train tracks and stuff.

388
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:53,600
 - For a while, it was the most profitable thing you could do.

389
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:55,600
 So people were just building mad little railways

390
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:57,200
 everywhere, thousands of miles.

391
00:14:57,200 --> 00:14:59,360
 But railway madmen was a different thing.

392
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:01,680
 People were worried at the time of social change,

393
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:04,960
 and you were locked in the compartments.

394
00:15:04,960 --> 00:15:05,920
 That was another thing.

395
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:09,440
 So people really freaked out at the prospect of train travel,

396
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:10,720
 making people lose their way.

397
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:12,400
 It's specifically man as well,

398
00:15:12,400 --> 00:15:15,200
 and just go bananas and berserk, basically.

399
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:17,040
 - Yeah. - 'Cause of the speed you were going?

400
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:18,160
 'Cause of the speed...

401
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:20,480
 - Also, it enclosed in tunnels a lot.

402
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:21,680
 I think that was a problem.

403
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:22,640
 - There was a lot of...

404
00:15:22,640 --> 00:15:24,800
 Yeah, there's a historian called Amy Millen Smith,

405
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:28,000
 and she did a fantastic report on this,

406
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,600
 like a thesis about it.

407
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:32,640
 So it was normal men who were completely fine,

408
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:34,480
 but it was partly all the stuff you said, James,

409
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:37,360
 and partly stress and overwork and anxiety of mod...

410
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:39,760
 Like just modern life, the modern condition,

411
00:15:39,760 --> 00:15:42,800
 meant that, you know, in 1869, a gentleman suddenly

412
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:44,800
 took off all his clothing and leaned out of the windows

413
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:46,800
 of his carriage, talking nonsense, you know.

414
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:49,760
 And it was just apparently as soon as the train stopped,

415
00:15:49,760 --> 00:15:51,760
 or they got off the train, they completely recovered their wits,

416
00:15:51,760 --> 00:15:52,320
 and they were fine.

417
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:54,320
 It was literally the act of being on a moving train.

418
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:57,040
 - Now hang on, can I button with...

419
00:15:57,040 --> 00:16:00,240
 Is there anything to do with sitting backwards on a train?

420
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:03,520
 - Oh, don't worry. - They looked into that scientific issue whereby

421
00:16:03,520 --> 00:16:06,800
 it could drive you mad if you're always facing the wrong way

422
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:08,400
 and going in a certain direction.

423
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:10,240
 - Yeah. - And I hope it's going backwards on a train.

424
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:11,920
 - It feels sick, yeah, yeah. - It's you.

425
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:13,600
 - Yeah, none of you guys. - I love it.

426
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:16,240
 - Well, yeah, I'm not a fan of it.

427
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:19,280
 So I think it could be linked to a bit of madness that might come.

428
00:16:19,280 --> 00:16:21,120
 - I prefer it. I prefer seeing backwards on my...

429
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:22,720
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah. - I actually prefer it as well,

430
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:24,560
 because if you crash head on to something,

431
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:26,320
 then you have something to stop you from...

432
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:27,200
 - Oh, y'all crash theory.

433
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:27,920
 - Yeah.

434
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:31,760
 - And don't think backwards crash theory. - Yeah, yeah, that's interesting.

435
00:16:31,760 --> 00:16:35,040
 - So you think James that they should put all the seats in a car backwards, presumably?

436
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:37,600
 - Well, I think I'm not the only person who thinks that.

437
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:39,040
 - Really? - I mean, that is safer.

438
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:40,400
 - Except the driver seat, presumably.

439
00:16:40,400 --> 00:16:45,040
 - Just don't hold the cars reverse everywhere.

440
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:46,400
 - Yeah.

441
00:16:46,400 --> 00:16:48,240
 - That's... yeah, yeah, yeah.

442
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:50,320
 - Just lean around. You're arm over the other seat.

443
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:51,440
 You do that classic move.

444
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:52,800
 - Yes, nice, nice. - Yeah.

445
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:54,560
 - Everyone would drive a lot more slowly.

446
00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:55,280
 - Yeah. - Just safer.

447
00:16:56,880 --> 00:16:59,520
 - Do you guys know a right-handed batter called...

448
00:16:59,520 --> 00:17:05,840
 Lassa Rousseau, Talibula, Minerva, Lenny Vé Vaca,

449
00:17:05,840 --> 00:17:09,760
 Boulin, Miner, Kula, Cala, Kebalau?

450
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:11,600
 - Yes, of course. - Yeah, I have his shirt,

451
00:17:11,600 --> 00:17:13,760
 but it can't be a fortune to get his name on the pack.

452
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:16,640
 Is that... - I don't know him.

453
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:19,040
 - Is it a real name of someone we have heard of?

454
00:17:19,040 --> 00:17:19,840
 - No, no, it's not.

455
00:17:19,840 --> 00:17:21,200
 It's just the longest crooked, his name ever,

456
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:23,200
 but he's just a pacific ricketer from Fiji.

457
00:17:23,200 --> 00:17:24,880
 And he sounds like a great guy.

458
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:26,240
 Larger because of his long name.

459
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:28,560
 His surname means "Returned Alive"

460
00:17:28,560 --> 00:17:31,520
 from Nancula Hospital at La Kemba Island in the Lao Group,

461
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:34,640
 which is easier to pronounce if you want to do it that way.

462
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:36,480
 - Last members for the Lao Group, please.

463
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:37,760
 Last members for the Lao Group.

464
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:41,120
 Buses departing shortly.

465
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:44,880
 But yeah, he was great.

466
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:45,600
 He used to...

467
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:47,120
 They played one international game, Fiji,

468
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:50,640
 against New Zealand in the 1940s and '50s when he played.

469
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:54,160
 And they made him serenade them with South Sea songs after the match,

470
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:55,200
 which he did.

471
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:57,360
 A game, lovely man, I know.

472
00:17:57,360 --> 00:18:02,960
 - You know that it took 120 years after the invention of the cricket box

473
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:04,960
 to invent the cricket helmet.

474
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:07,680
 - Okay.

475
00:18:07,680 --> 00:18:09,680
 - I like to post that show to people's priorities.

476
00:18:09,680 --> 00:18:11,200
 - Pretty much. - Why, doesn't it?

477
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:12,080
 - Would you agree with that?

478
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:15,040
 - I'd have thought, yeah, even terms of what you're keen on.

479
00:18:15,040 --> 00:18:16,160
 I suppose it...

480
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:17,440
 - You've got a skull.

481
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:19,040
 You don't have a penis skull.

482
00:18:19,040 --> 00:18:21,040
 - You don't have a genital exoskeleton.

483
00:18:21,040 --> 00:18:21,840
 - Exactly.

484
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:22,720
 - Yeah.

485
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:27,280
 - We're hoping these less than the guys can do something.

486
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:32,560
 - The ball is generally going to be in the lower part of your body.

487
00:18:32,560 --> 00:18:33,600
 - Amid ships.

488
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:34,240
 - Yeah.

489
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:37,600
 - Well, it's absolutely about how bouncing the surface as well, isn't it?

490
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:40,000
 These days it's very bouncing because they're protective and stuff.

491
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,520
 But if it was opened to the elements at the time,

492
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:43,280
 the bounce could be variable.

493
00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:44,640
 It's more lighty to be lower and slower,

494
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:45,840
 so you'd be more lighty to take one.

495
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:47,040
 And the plums than in the noggin.

496
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:54,480
 - Yeah, about 1850s was the Palner's patent-growing protector, as it was called,

497
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:56,880
 before that you'd just stuff a hanky down there to improvise it.

498
00:18:56,880 --> 00:18:58,960
 But it was only in the 1970s.

499
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:00,720
 - It was your hanky made out of Kevlar or what?

500
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:01,360
 - Thank you.

501
00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:02,160
 - Yeah, yeah.

502
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:04,160
 - But if it isn't very well used, hanky,

503
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:05,360
 I think that can actually...

504
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:07,360
 (laughing)

505
00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:09,360
 - It's hard to fold.

506
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:13,680
 - A heavy head cold actually does protect you

507
00:19:13,680 --> 00:19:16,080
 in unpredictable ways, yeah.

508
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:18,560
 And if there's any you could ever use the same one as a kind of gumbee hanky,

509
00:19:18,560 --> 00:19:19,920
 it's the first crooked helmet at the same time.

510
00:19:19,920 --> 00:19:21,120
 (laughing)

511
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:22,640
 - It's so slanky tied and it's gone.

512
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:25,440
 - Would you have a commentate on Cricket?

513
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:26,240
 Well, I hope you'd done it.

514
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:29,760
 - I think I have done online just briefly.

515
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:33,280
 Yeah, it's quite, it's quite awesome responsibility to be perfectly honest.

516
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:35,760
 If you're thinking, the other people can't see it, and I've really got to...

517
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:36,400
 - Yeah.

518
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:37,360
 - You know, like when you say to the drive in the left,

519
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:38,720
 it's like, I can't see my left shoulder.

520
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:40,240
 Can you tell me if there's anything coming down that hill?

521
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:41,440
 (laughing)

522
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:43,120
 It's that sort of pressure, but for hours.

523
00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:44,640
 - It's days.

524
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:45,440
 - I mean, these people can be, you know,

525
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:46,720
 they can be sort of several countries where

526
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:48,480
 and I've got to describe what's going on.

527
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:50,480
 I think it's more high pressure work than people imagine.

528
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:52,080
 - Well, I did read a description of what it's like

529
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:54,320
 commentating on something like Test Match Special.

530
00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:55,520
 I can't remember who it was who did it.

531
00:19:55,520 --> 00:19:57,120
 Well, like one of the famous commentators said,

532
00:19:57,120 --> 00:20:00,320
 "Look, this is the apex of human civilization.

533
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:03,360
 "You're sitting observing a nice cricket match happening.

534
00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:05,040
 "People are sending in homemade cakes to you,

535
00:20:05,040 --> 00:20:08,160
 "which you can then review on there during a lull in play, basically."

536
00:20:08,160 --> 00:20:09,760
 - That the whole play is a lull.

537
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:10,560
 - Yeah.

538
00:20:10,560 --> 00:20:12,000
 There's a sort of breathing space.

539
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:13,920
 It's not like commentating on tennis or something like that,

540
00:20:13,920 --> 00:20:14,720
 which must be, you know.

541
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:16,400
 - Have you a radio commentator for tennis?

542
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:18,560
 That's a horse racing or whatever.

543
00:20:18,560 --> 00:20:19,400
 - Exactly.

544
00:20:19,400 --> 00:20:21,600
 - You know, your word per minute is just--

545
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:23,360
 - Exactly, yeah, yeah, I've seen them.

546
00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:25,840
 - But this is, he was saying, I think it was a he.

547
00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:30,400
 You were either having to describe the immediate play,

548
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:32,080
 which like if there's something going on,

549
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:34,000
 you need to explain that really clearly to the listener,

550
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,640
 like he was saying, and then during the quieter bits,

551
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:38,680
 you're talking more about the overall shape of the game.

552
00:20:38,680 --> 00:20:39,760
 And during the really quiet bits,

553
00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:42,280
 he's talking about the grounds and the whole history

554
00:20:42,280 --> 00:20:43,120
 of cricket.

555
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:44,520
 And so you've got three different modes

556
00:20:44,520 --> 00:20:47,080
 that you can switch between to a depending on what.

557
00:20:47,080 --> 00:20:48,920
 - Oh, you've got mode full, which is something

558
00:20:48,920 --> 00:20:50,040
 completely unrelated.

559
00:20:50,040 --> 00:20:51,880
 Have you guys ever seen the clip of,

560
00:20:51,880 --> 00:20:54,040
 it's the Australian commentator and he tells the joke

561
00:20:54,040 --> 00:20:57,400
 that it's a Nicknack party work, give the frog a loan.

562
00:20:57,400 --> 00:20:58,240
 - Right.

563
00:20:58,240 --> 00:20:59,720
 - Look at Daniel, is that a Keith?

564
00:20:59,720 --> 00:21:01,720
 - It's a Keith, it's Kerrio Keith.

565
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:04,120
 And he's, and I can't, who he's commentating with,

566
00:21:04,120 --> 00:21:05,200
 but there's always a straight man

567
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:06,520
 who's actually commentating on the cricket

568
00:21:06,520 --> 00:21:08,000
 and then, you know, someone more joking.

569
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,200
 And he's trying to tell this very long joke

570
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:12,680
 and the other commentator is trying to get in the way

571
00:21:12,680 --> 00:21:14,200
 and explain what's happening in the cricket.

572
00:21:14,200 --> 00:21:15,800
 And then every two minutes he says,

573
00:21:15,800 --> 00:21:16,760
 "And there's no run."

574
00:21:16,760 --> 00:21:19,560
 (laughter)

575
00:21:19,560 --> 00:21:21,920
 - That's where you use your elbow to test the temperature

576
00:21:21,920 --> 00:21:24,160
 of bath water, for instance, rather than your fingers aren't

577
00:21:24,160 --> 00:21:25,600
 actually very sensitive to people with their hands

578
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:27,480
 and go, "That's okay, but it's not actually..."

579
00:21:27,480 --> 00:21:29,600
 - I feel like my hands are sensitive to temperature.

580
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:30,760
 - I thought it was that your elbow is the

581
00:21:30,760 --> 00:21:32,040
 bit of you that's most like a baby.

582
00:21:32,040 --> 00:21:34,320
 - 'Cause I always wear gloves, I always wear gloves

583
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:36,600
 when it's cold, I don't wear elbow patches.

584
00:21:36,600 --> 00:21:37,920
 - Oh, you should do it.

585
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:39,600
 - You lose so much heat through your elbows.

586
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:41,160
 - Yeah, yeah, but you're only, yeah.

587
00:21:41,160 --> 00:21:42,640
 - But also you're down the skatepark a lot,

588
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:44,600
 you're called protective equipment.

589
00:21:44,600 --> 00:21:45,840
 So they're elbow guards.

590
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:47,160
 You just don't think of them as well.

591
00:21:47,160 --> 00:21:48,000
 - Of course.

592
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,320
 - What's the sport wear?

593
00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:51,680
 It's two villages versus another,

594
00:21:51,680 --> 00:21:53,720
 and it doesn't seem to be a limit on another.

595
00:21:53,720 --> 00:21:55,280
 And it's basically getting a ball from...

596
00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:56,120
 - Yeah.

597
00:21:56,120 --> 00:21:57,360
 - Two posts or something like that.

598
00:21:57,360 --> 00:21:58,200
 - Something that's getting from one thing.

599
00:21:58,200 --> 00:22:00,600
 - Oppies versus the Downies or opposite of the Downers.

600
00:22:00,600 --> 00:22:03,080
 And it's just like village football, really.

601
00:22:03,080 --> 00:22:05,680
 - But there's no limit on numbers on the Down.

602
00:22:05,680 --> 00:22:07,600
 - Well, I think these days the police limit

603
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:08,600
 who can go.

604
00:22:08,600 --> 00:22:10,080
 (laughter)

605
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:10,920
 - Yeah.

606
00:22:10,920 --> 00:22:13,200
 - I mean, those sort of sports wear

607
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:14,040
 there's a flexibility.

608
00:22:14,040 --> 00:22:15,680
 Like how did it go?

609
00:22:15,680 --> 00:22:18,920
 La Cross, there's a sort of set length,

610
00:22:18,920 --> 00:22:21,200
 or parameters within which the length of a lacrosse pitch

611
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:23,080
 must be, but actually there is no side boundary.

612
00:22:23,080 --> 00:22:25,560
 That's entirely based on where you happen to be playing.

613
00:22:25,560 --> 00:22:26,400
 - Yeah.

614
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:27,240
 - So you can set off running in wonder,

615
00:22:27,240 --> 00:22:28,920
 and you can just keep going until there's an obstacle.

616
00:22:28,920 --> 00:22:30,520
 Essentially, that doesn't get out.

617
00:22:30,520 --> 00:22:31,360
 - Yeah, yeah, you can do that.

618
00:22:31,360 --> 00:22:32,200
 - We used to do that at school.

619
00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:34,320
 And I play football in the playground.

620
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:35,560
 You would have one goal,

621
00:22:35,560 --> 00:22:38,080
 and you'd have two teams shooting towards the same goal.

622
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:39,840
 And you would just get someone who would get the ball

623
00:22:39,840 --> 00:22:42,120
 I'd just run in the complete opposite direction

624
00:22:42,120 --> 00:22:44,840
 with the ball so everyone had to chase after them.

625
00:22:44,840 --> 00:22:48,400
 - It's quite, 'cause there's no boundaries.

626
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:50,320
 - But that is true in official lacrosse rules.

627
00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:51,440
 I think it's just women's lacrosse.

628
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:53,920
 I weirdly, I think men's lacrosse does have boundaries,

629
00:22:53,920 --> 00:22:54,760
 but women's lacrosse--

630
00:22:54,760 --> 00:22:55,600
 - Men need boundaries.

631
00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:56,440
 (laughter)

632
00:22:56,440 --> 00:22:57,600
 - It's good indeed.

633
00:22:57,600 --> 00:23:00,360
 - Wasn't it something about like the earliest games

634
00:23:00,360 --> 00:23:02,920
 of lacrosse had an insane number of people?

635
00:23:02,920 --> 00:23:05,320
 - The American lacrosse foundation claims

636
00:23:05,320 --> 00:23:07,960
 the earliest games could have over 100,000 players.

637
00:23:07,960 --> 00:23:08,800
 - Stop it.

638
00:23:09,800 --> 00:23:11,840
 - And try commentating on that.

639
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:13,640
 - Or state of those changing rooms as well.

640
00:23:13,640 --> 00:23:15,400
 (laughter)

641
00:23:15,400 --> 00:23:17,880
 - But it's like the handshake before the game is going to take--

642
00:23:17,880 --> 00:23:19,200
 (laughter)

643
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:21,560
 - But it's a sort of roughly tafty sport in America,

644
00:23:21,560 --> 00:23:22,920
 I think, isn't it, LaCrosse?

645
00:23:22,920 --> 00:23:25,520
 We might associate LaCrosse with sort of girls'

646
00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:26,360
 boarding schools.

647
00:23:26,360 --> 00:23:27,200
 - Yeah.

648
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:28,040
 - In America, then it'd be--

649
00:23:28,040 --> 00:23:33,040
 - Well, 'cause women's lacrosse and men's lacrosse

650
00:23:33,040 --> 00:23:34,960
 are like just different games, aren't they?

651
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:36,360
 - Yeah. - They have different rules, different.

652
00:23:36,360 --> 00:23:37,360
 - Yeah, totally different.

653
00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:38,440
 - But you wouldn't hear phrases like

654
00:23:38,440 --> 00:23:41,440
 roughty tafty in the men's lacrosse that they play in America,

655
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:44,200
 for instance, whereas you might in the female boarding school

656
00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:45,720
 across the replay here.

657
00:23:45,720 --> 00:23:47,200
 I've never heard roughty tafty before.

658
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:48,360
 - Well, why not exist as a different--

659
00:23:48,360 --> 00:23:49,360
 - No, the phrase. - No, the phrase.

660
00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:50,200
 - No, the phrase.

661
00:23:50,200 --> 00:23:51,040
 - No, no, no.

662
00:23:51,040 --> 00:23:51,880
 - Some sort of post-surgery.

663
00:23:51,880 --> 00:23:52,720
 (laughter)

664
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:55,720
 - Even if it's a bubble that's a dessert.

665
00:23:55,720 --> 00:23:58,320
 - Oh, then animals, golden hamsters can navigate their way home,

666
00:23:58,320 --> 00:24:00,760
 even when blindfolded and let it a complicated route

667
00:24:00,760 --> 00:24:01,960
 away from their nests.

668
00:24:01,960 --> 00:24:02,960
 - Can they? How do they do it?

669
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:03,800
 Do we know?

670
00:24:03,800 --> 00:24:06,320
 - No,, I don't think we do know.

671
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:07,440
 - Oh, and it's really mysterious, isn't it?

672
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:09,240
 Because it's, you know, some of these senses are not,

673
00:24:09,240 --> 00:24:10,360
 we don't fully understand.

674
00:24:10,360 --> 00:24:11,800
 So there's a thing called the,

675
00:24:11,800 --> 00:24:13,480
 oh, it's called the Reed Warbler bird.

676
00:24:13,480 --> 00:24:14,320
 - Oh, yeah.

677
00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:17,040
 - And the scientists wanted to disrupt,

678
00:24:17,040 --> 00:24:19,200
 they thought they must be using the Earth's magnetic field.

679
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:20,800
 Okay, so we'll disrupt it.

680
00:24:20,800 --> 00:24:24,120
 So they attached small magnets to these birds' foreheads

681
00:24:24,120 --> 00:24:24,960
 in an experiment,

682
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:26,680
 and they also blocked their view of the stars.

683
00:24:26,680 --> 00:24:29,560
 And, obviously, they couldn't navigate.

684
00:24:29,560 --> 00:24:30,400
 (laughter)

685
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:31,920
 I don't really know what that proves.

686
00:24:31,920 --> 00:24:32,760
 (laughter)

687
00:24:32,760 --> 00:24:35,000
 - The homing pigeons used to use in the war

688
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:37,280
 to work out where sort of various ships were in things.

689
00:24:37,280 --> 00:24:38,960
 Because they had their homing instincts.

690
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:41,440
 And they would know that they would fly

691
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:43,120
 at a very particular pace.

692
00:24:43,120 --> 00:24:44,760
 And they would know what time they were released.

693
00:24:44,760 --> 00:24:45,800
 And so they're there for,

694
00:24:45,800 --> 00:24:47,600
 and the angle from which they basically arrived.

695
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:50,800
 They could work out how far away from that distance.

696
00:24:50,800 --> 00:24:51,640
 - Really?

697
00:24:51,640 --> 00:24:52,680
 - You'd work out the maths backwards.

698
00:24:52,680 --> 00:24:54,200
 So they've arrived from over there.

699
00:24:54,200 --> 00:24:55,440
 They set off at this time.

700
00:24:55,440 --> 00:24:56,400
 So they must have there for,

701
00:24:56,400 --> 00:24:57,240
 that's the way they work.

702
00:24:57,240 --> 00:24:58,240
 - I usually have a 20-hour.

703
00:24:58,240 --> 00:25:00,680
 - But how do they know where they set off from?

704
00:25:00,680 --> 00:25:02,680
 - 'Cause they're going to note on them.

705
00:25:02,680 --> 00:25:04,480
 - Oh, what time they set off?

706
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:06,480
 - Well, that information must be,

707
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:07,760
 yes, I was going to say that must be radio,

708
00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:08,760
 but then presumably the people radioing

709
00:25:08,760 --> 00:25:10,000
 and say where they were.

710
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:11,960
 But maybe, maybe there's so many internet.

711
00:25:11,960 --> 00:25:12,800
 Maybe everything.

712
00:25:12,800 --> 00:25:14,600
 Any radio signal you send can be intercepted.

713
00:25:14,600 --> 00:25:15,880
 But I'm not going to tell you where we are,

714
00:25:15,880 --> 00:25:17,760
 but it's 7.58 and I'm releasing the pigeon.

715
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:18,760
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

716
00:25:18,760 --> 00:25:20,560
 - And then it's making that what you will.

717
00:25:20,560 --> 00:25:21,480
 (laughter)

718
00:25:21,480 --> 00:25:22,880
 - Good luck with that, yeah.

719
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:25,120
 - Oh, Keith has gone off on one.

720
00:25:25,120 --> 00:25:27,120
 They were genuinely useful.

721
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:28,280
 They were, they were, they were,

722
00:25:28,280 --> 00:25:29,240
 they were sort of called up.

723
00:25:29,240 --> 00:25:31,440
 People that were sort of looked after pigeons

724
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:32,840
 were suddenly, they would, they were,

725
00:25:32,840 --> 00:25:33,960
 they hide him on for them.

726
00:25:33,960 --> 00:25:36,440
 - Yeah, suddenly we went from complete weirdo loners

727
00:25:36,440 --> 00:25:39,840
 to very sought after people, I'm so sorry.

728
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:40,680
 - Oh my God.

729
00:25:40,680 --> 00:25:42,200
 - That's not how I feel about pigeon fancies, really.

730
00:25:42,200 --> 00:25:44,240
 - For our audience are in the pigeon loft at the moment.

731
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:45,080
 - I know.

732
00:25:45,080 --> 00:25:45,920
 - Yeah, yeah.

733
00:25:45,920 --> 00:25:48,480
 - I've got on satire.

734
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:51,200
 You know, tatler, we're all subscribers.

735
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:52,040
 - Of course.

736
00:25:52,040 --> 00:25:52,880
 - Yeah.

737
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:54,320
 - That was meant to be satirical.

738
00:25:54,320 --> 00:25:55,320
 (laughter)

739
00:25:55,320 --> 00:25:56,800
 It was meant to be taking the piss out of you.

740
00:25:56,800 --> 00:25:57,640
 - Can you explain what it is?

741
00:25:57,640 --> 00:25:58,640
 - Sorry for those of us.

742
00:25:58,640 --> 00:25:59,640
 - Sorry.

743
00:25:59,640 --> 00:26:00,480
 - We grew up in Bolton.

744
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:02,000
 - Sorry.

745
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:03,600
 It's really not your area.

746
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:05,520
 - Right, world of interiors, but about people.

747
00:26:05,520 --> 00:26:07,960
 (laughter)

748
00:26:07,960 --> 00:26:09,600
 - So yes, tatler for international listeners

749
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:11,920
 and anyone who's more civilized

750
00:26:11,920 --> 00:26:14,880
 is basically a magazine for high society.

751
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:17,960
 It's like photographs of people who aren't quite

752
00:26:17,960 --> 00:26:19,840
 the royal family, 'cause they probably can't get access

753
00:26:19,840 --> 00:26:21,840
 to them, but who are mates with the royal family.

754
00:26:21,840 --> 00:26:22,680
 - Right, so.

755
00:26:22,680 --> 00:26:23,520
 - Having wedding.

756
00:26:23,520 --> 00:26:25,520
 - Is it tatler that's got, sort of on the back page,

757
00:26:25,520 --> 00:26:27,760
 there's always like a, it's not a high street honey,

758
00:26:27,760 --> 00:26:30,480
 but it's kind of a, it's like an eligible young lady

759
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:32,320
 who is engaged.

760
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:33,320
 I think maybe that's it, is like,

761
00:26:33,320 --> 00:26:34,320
 look at this beautiful young woman.

762
00:26:34,320 --> 00:26:35,160
 She's just gone engaged.

763
00:26:35,160 --> 00:26:36,000
 You can't get together with her.

764
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:36,840
 - Oh, right.

765
00:26:36,840 --> 00:26:37,680
 - Is that it?

766
00:26:37,680 --> 00:26:38,520
 - Probably about, yeah.

767
00:26:38,520 --> 00:26:40,000
 I mean, it doesn't sound like any other magazine would have that.

768
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:42,200
 - Yeah, like Country Life has a sort of,

769
00:26:42,200 --> 00:26:44,120
 yeah, it's made like a lady of the month.

770
00:26:44,120 --> 00:26:45,920
 - Maybe it's Country Life, I'm not talking about that.

771
00:26:45,920 --> 00:26:48,360
 - But yes, it's a sort of that with an RT black and white photo.

772
00:26:48,360 --> 00:26:49,200
 - Yes.

773
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:51,840
 - And sometimes I think it's like single-hand looking.

774
00:26:51,840 --> 00:26:52,680
 - Really?

775
00:26:52,680 --> 00:26:54,240
 - And free available in your area.

776
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:55,560
 - Oh, that kind of thing, isn't it?

777
00:26:55,560 --> 00:26:57,720
 - So this is the page three of...

778
00:26:57,720 --> 00:27:00,000
 - Except it's page like 128, 'cause of all the adverts

779
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:01,000
 for posh watches.

780
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:01,840
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

781
00:27:01,840 --> 00:27:02,680
 - And it's a monthly publication.

782
00:27:02,680 --> 00:27:04,480
 So it doesn't work in the way that's sort of Metro used to have

783
00:27:04,480 --> 00:27:06,760
 our eyes saw yesterday on the 802 from Voxelore,

784
00:27:06,760 --> 00:27:08,080
 but we're like, I think I saw you back.

785
00:27:08,080 --> 00:27:09,920
 Must have been, I must have been up for four months ago.

786
00:27:09,920 --> 00:27:11,120
 (laughing)

787
00:27:11,120 --> 00:27:12,520
 I think you admired my plowing.

788
00:27:12,520 --> 00:27:14,000
 (laughing)

789
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:14,840
 - That's disgusting.

790
00:27:14,840 --> 00:27:15,680
 - I was.

791
00:27:15,680 --> 00:27:16,520
 - Oh, yeah.

792
00:27:16,520 --> 00:27:17,360
 - Rude of me.

793
00:27:17,360 --> 00:27:18,200
 - Yeah.

794
00:27:18,200 --> 00:27:20,000
 - Yeah, so what about time?

795
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:20,840
 - Oh, yeah, sorry.

796
00:27:20,840 --> 00:27:23,640
 It was founded by a guy called Richard Steele

797
00:27:23,640 --> 00:27:26,200
 who called himself Isaac Bickerstaff

798
00:27:26,200 --> 00:27:27,360
 when he edited "Tatler"

799
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:29,200
 and Isaac Bickerstaff, actually.

800
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:30,480
 You'll remember the name James.

801
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:31,720
 - I do know the name, but why?

802
00:27:31,720 --> 00:27:36,080
 - It was because Jonathan Swift, once published in 1708,

803
00:27:36,080 --> 00:27:38,560
 so another great, the other great probably satirist

804
00:27:38,560 --> 00:27:41,440
 at the time, published the "Almania" predictions of the year,

805
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:44,880
 writing as Isaac Bickerstaff and he predicted the death

806
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:48,600
 of this astrologer and society person called John Partridge.

807
00:27:48,600 --> 00:27:51,160
 And he predicted it on April 1st, it was an April 4th joke.

808
00:27:51,160 --> 00:27:52,800
 And this poor guy John Partridge,

809
00:27:52,800 --> 00:27:54,400
 who was a bit of a butt of jokes,

810
00:27:54,400 --> 00:27:56,760
 spent the rest of his life trying to convince people

811
00:27:56,760 --> 00:27:59,560
 that he wasn't dead and when this turned up.

812
00:27:59,560 --> 00:28:02,560
 And he wrote a letter saying, I'm not dead.

813
00:28:02,560 --> 00:28:04,440
 And Jonathan Swift said, well, that's a hoax

814
00:28:04,440 --> 00:28:07,000
 'cause he is, you know, seeing the body made.

815
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:07,840
 - Yeah.

816
00:28:07,840 --> 00:28:09,480
 - It was an unkind time, a lot of sick burns

817
00:28:09,480 --> 00:28:11,280
 being dished out all over the place,

818
00:28:11,280 --> 00:28:12,960
 like saying one of the Irish are so hungry,

819
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:14,320
 why don't they just eat their babies,

820
00:28:14,320 --> 00:28:15,320
 which was during the famine.

821
00:28:15,320 --> 00:28:17,920
 It was incredibly harsh satir.

822
00:28:17,920 --> 00:28:19,240
 - Right.

823
00:28:19,240 --> 00:28:20,960
 - Imagine that, imagine that,

824
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:23,560
 'cause it sounds bad now, but it doesn't really love the famine.

825
00:28:23,560 --> 00:28:24,400
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah, no.

826
00:28:24,400 --> 00:28:25,240
 - It's actually even worse.

827
00:28:25,240 --> 00:28:26,600
 - It's pitch black, exactly.

828
00:28:26,600 --> 00:28:28,040
 He's trying to draw attention to the famine.

829
00:28:28,040 --> 00:28:30,000
 And, you know, the awful cruelty that has caused it.

830
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:31,040
 But he's, you know,

831
00:28:31,040 --> 00:28:33,000
 he's doing those through a reading process.

832
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:34,800
 - These days, there's not enough nuance on Twitter

833
00:28:34,800 --> 00:28:35,800
 for people to get that.

834
00:28:35,800 --> 00:28:37,280
 I don't think he'd be able to have done it today.

835
00:28:37,280 --> 00:28:39,080
 - So there's a foremost satirist of your time

836
00:28:39,080 --> 00:28:41,160
 and it's just to be considered an age lord,

837
00:28:41,160 --> 00:28:42,880
 but he actually is a brutal guy.

838
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:44,480
 It's nuanced, for heaven's sake.

839
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:46,240
 (laughing)

840
00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:48,280
 - One of you try, we're doing down the people.

841
00:28:48,280 --> 00:28:49,960
 I want one of you to tweet something

842
00:28:49,960 --> 00:28:53,080
 about a group of people eating babies today

843
00:28:53,080 --> 00:28:54,320
 and see what happens to you.

844
00:28:54,320 --> 00:28:56,240
 - I'm not on Twitter.

845
00:28:56,240 --> 00:28:57,400
 So, one of you two will--

846
00:28:57,400 --> 00:28:59,040
 - On Twitter, we'll go down and storm these days.

847
00:28:59,040 --> 00:29:01,280
 I can show you that in a group of news.

848
00:29:01,280 --> 00:29:02,880
 - I could put it in a WhatsApp group.

849
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:05,120
 (laughing)

850
00:29:05,120 --> 00:29:06,200
 - Just see.

851
00:29:06,200 --> 00:29:07,040
 - Yeah.

852
00:29:07,040 --> 00:29:08,520
 - Yeah, the Christmas one's gone quite.

853
00:29:08,520 --> 00:29:10,560
 (laughing)

854
00:29:10,560 --> 00:29:11,800
 - Just out of the blue.

855
00:29:11,800 --> 00:29:13,400
 - Oh, what's Mars up to?

856
00:29:13,400 --> 00:29:15,280
 - Oh, what are we thinking this year?

857
00:29:15,280 --> 00:29:18,200
 - Another pseudonym, John Barron.

858
00:29:18,200 --> 00:29:19,440
 Do you know this one?

859
00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:20,440
 - No, Barron.

860
00:29:20,440 --> 00:29:21,960
 - How do you know the name Barron?

861
00:29:21,960 --> 00:29:22,960
 - Barron. - Barron.

862
00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:24,800
 - Or Barron, like, Barron.

863
00:29:24,800 --> 00:29:26,600
 - B-A-D-L-R-O-N.

864
00:29:26,600 --> 00:29:27,440
 - The Barron Knights.

865
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:28,920
 - She's a famous Barron these days.

866
00:29:28,920 --> 00:29:29,760
 - Barron Trump.

867
00:29:29,760 --> 00:29:30,600
 - Yes.

868
00:29:30,600 --> 00:29:32,960
 So, Donald Trump pseudonym, John Barron.

869
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:37,720
 So, when Forbes were doing the richest people list,

870
00:29:37,720 --> 00:29:39,120
 John Barron wrote to them saying,

871
00:29:39,120 --> 00:29:40,440
 "Oh, you've got to put Trump in here."

872
00:29:40,440 --> 00:29:41,680
 He's a billionaire.

873
00:29:41,680 --> 00:29:42,520
 - No.

874
00:29:42,520 --> 00:29:43,880
 - Yeah, and he's got a few others.

875
00:29:43,880 --> 00:29:46,120
 There's a guy called John Miller,

876
00:29:46,120 --> 00:29:48,160
 who once wrote to People Magazine,

877
00:29:48,160 --> 00:29:51,520
 who'd said something about Trump saying actually,

878
00:29:51,520 --> 00:29:53,760
 Trump is a very compassionate husband.

879
00:29:53,760 --> 00:29:56,800
 And lots of beautiful women are always asking to go out with him.

880
00:29:56,800 --> 00:29:59,000
 In fact, Madonna called and wanted to go out with him.

881
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:00,520
 That I could tell you.

882
00:30:00,520 --> 00:30:02,400
 - But what makes you think that's one of his pseudonyms?

883
00:30:02,400 --> 00:30:04,440
 - We, it came out in court later.

884
00:30:04,440 --> 00:30:06,840
 - Oh, that's amazing, that's it.

885
00:30:06,840 --> 00:30:09,420
 (upbeat music)

886
00:30:09,420 --> 00:30:13,520
 - Okay, that's it.

887
00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:15,480
 That is all of our outtakes.

888
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:17,560
 If you have anything to say about them,

889
00:30:17,560 --> 00:30:20,520
 if you want to share any extra juicy bits of detail

890
00:30:20,520 --> 00:30:21,440
 that you know about them,

891
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:25,280
 you can message us on podcast@qy.com.

892
00:30:25,280 --> 00:30:27,080
 Those emails go through to Andy,

893
00:30:27,080 --> 00:30:29,760
 and a lot of those emails then get taken over

894
00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:31,640
 to drop us a line where we discuss them.

895
00:30:31,640 --> 00:30:34,760
 So send us your favorite facts, send us an anecdote,

896
00:30:34,760 --> 00:30:37,400
 send us anything that you think is worth sharing,

897
00:30:37,400 --> 00:30:40,640
 and hopefully you can make it onto a drop us a line.

898
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:42,880
 Just a reminder, no such thing as a fish.com.

899
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:46,080
 You got the ticket link for all of our upcoming gigs,

900
00:30:46,080 --> 00:30:48,680

902
00:30:51,560 --> 00:30:54,240
 and that is the fifth and sixth of September.

903
00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:56,440
 So get your tickets now, and that's it.

907
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:02,280
 Goodbye.

908
00:31:02,280 --> 00:31:04,860
 (upbeat music)

909
00:31:04,860 --> 00:31:07,440
 (upbeat music)

910
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:08,600
 (upbeat music)
