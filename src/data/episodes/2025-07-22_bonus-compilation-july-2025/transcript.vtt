 [MUSIC]

00:00:04.320 --> 00:00:08.240
 Hey Clubfish members, welcome to your secret bonus bit of content.

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:10.000
 We've got a compilation for you today.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:14.320
 This is the best of the outtakes of things that didn't make it to the main show.

00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:17.040
 It features me, James, Andy, and Anna.

00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:19.920
 But you've got some bonus voices joining us this week.

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:25.440
 We've got Reese Darby, the brilliant Reese, and of course, the excellent Miles Jupp.

00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:27.360
 You will have heard them on recent episodes.

00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:32.000
 And this is all the stuff that didn't quite fit into the main episodes.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.560
 Oh and quickly before we get into it, just a quick thank you to everyone who came to the Crosswise festival.

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:38.000
 We had such a fun gig.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.680
 There was an awesome ending to it where we did a quiz with members from the audience.

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:43.360
 It was just so much fun.

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:45.200
 So thank you everyone who came.

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:48.640
 There's some people traveled all the way from America to come see the show.

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:50.400
 Hope you enjoyed it.

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:54.080
 And if anyone else wants to come and see us do another live show,

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:56.800
 we're returning to the London Podcast Festival.

00:00:56.800 --> 00:00:59.840
 We're going to be there on the 5th and 6th of September.

00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:03.280
 We've got a couple of great guests lined up to join us on stage.

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:05.280
 Go to know such thing as a fish.com.

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:06.720
 You'll find the links there.

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:08.320
 Come and see us live.

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:11.840
 And I believe that there's going to be online streaming as well.

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:14.320
 So if you are overseas and you want to watch it,

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:18.800
 do check it out and buy your tickets to watch it online as it happens live.

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:23.280
 Last thing to mention is if you miss last week's drop us a line,

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:26.960
 just to let you know that the price of club fish is going up by 1 pound.

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:30.560
 So it is going to be 3 pounds 99 going forward.

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:31.760
 Hope that's okay with you all.

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:35.680
 We promise that we're going to continue to put out really fun formats.

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:37.200
 So don't go anywhere.

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:39.200
 And don't go anywhere right now because here we go.

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:40.480
 It's the compilation.

00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:44.080
 The four fishers recent miles on with the outtakes.

00:01:44.080 --> 00:02:06.320
 - There's a world one connection,

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:08.080
 as well as a world two connection in ugly.

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:10.640
 Which is really cool actually.

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:13.760
 So in world one, there was an understandable fear that the Germans

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:15.440
 were going to invade via Essex.

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:20.480
 And a plan was drawn up to evacuate the whole of Essex to Oxfordshire.

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:21.920
 1.4 million people.

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:24.000
 I don't think they told the people of Oxfordshire.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.640
 - Yeah, you were, what do you hear? - You didn't mention it.

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:27.760
 There's going to be some stuff happening.

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:29.200
 Just don't worry about it.

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:30.720
 Just keep your door shut.

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:33.760
 But they all got these, you know, things from the council saying

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:35.440
 this is what to do.

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:37.280
 - Councils have really diminished over there.

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:39.520
 They're like now they sometimes can't collect glass.

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:43.920
 Well, there's the undefonding, isn't it? We don't get the war anymore.

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:48.880
 And the information said, when ugly church bells ring incessantly,

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:51.760
 that's your sign, get out, goes to Oxfordshire.

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:55.280
 And they also, and they were told destroy all alcohol

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:58.720
 because if the Germans arrive and they're invading

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:03.360
 and they get drunk, that's even worse than a sober invading Nazi.

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:04.400
 Which is quite weird.

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:06.080
 - Really, that is weird because didn't,

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:08.720
 wasn't the battle of fishguard when the French came over?

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:12.960
 In the 18th century, the last time Britain was invaded at all.

00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:15.680
 They arrived, they all got drunk and couldn't do anything.

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:17.120
 - Well, I think it's really on the fence.

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:19.280
 Yes, will alcohol make the invaders worse or better?

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:21.280
 And maybe it depends on whether they're French or German.

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:22.000
 - Oh, yeah, maybe.

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:26.480
 But anyway, it's really cool because everyone was given

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:27.920
 these evacuation routes.

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:29.520
 And it meant you had to take all the back roads

00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:31.680
 because the army would be using the main roads.

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:34.880
 So they had these maps and there were arrows all over Essex

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:37.040
 painted on walls and trees and lamp posts

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:39.840
 and big white arrows showing people the way.

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:43.440
 And the only remnant that remains now is in Ugly.

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:47.360
 There's a wall which just has now only the little plaque left saying

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:50.800
 this is where the big white arrow was saying, "Get out of door."

00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:53.600
 Imagine arriving as a Nazi going, "Where is everyone?"

00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:56.400
 And then seeing giant arrows pointing at you towards

00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:58.560
 where you needed to go.

00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:02.000
 - We haven't got this through, Winston.

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:05.840
 Protesters have some good gear.

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:08.000
 Like I was looking at Stanstead protests.

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:10.080
 So there was a protest in Stanstead a few years ago

00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:14.400
 over a bunch of migrants who were being sent away

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:16.800
 and that one of those taken in the dead of night

00:04:16.800 --> 00:04:19.600
 stuck on a charter plane sent back to the country

00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:22.480
 from which they'd come from a while ago.

00:04:22.480 --> 00:04:24.160
 Big protest about that.

00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:28.160
 But the way they did it was they formed a circle around the plane.

00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:29.200
 So they got bought cutters.

00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:30.800
 They got into Stanstead Airport.

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:32.720
 They formed a circle around the plane

00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:35.120
 and they locked themselves in this circle

00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:39.600
 by putting their arms in pipes filled with expanding foam

00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:41.120
 and attaching their arms to each other.

00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:42.800
 So I put my arm in one end of the pipe

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:44.320
 and he puts his arm in the other.

00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:45.840
 Where you get it, what does it expand?

00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:48.160
 - It's almost like you know those Chinese finger traps

00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:49.440
 that you put your fingers in,

00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:50.880
 but like a super big version of that.

00:04:50.880 --> 00:04:52.480
 - Exactly, it's a giant one of those.

00:04:52.480 --> 00:04:53.360
 - What if I need a piss?

00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:55.520
 - Well, you can't, you just have to go loose.

00:04:55.520 --> 00:04:56.480
 You can't hold your willy.

00:04:56.480 --> 00:04:59.680
 - So sorry, you're in a big circle with your arms in the pipes.

00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:00.480
 Or our fingers touching.

00:05:00.480 --> 00:05:02.960
 - If you want to be happy.

00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:03.760
 - Possibly not.

00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:06.400
 - I don't think they, I think you don't want them touching

00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:08.320
 because you could have a wider circumference

00:05:08.320 --> 00:05:09.440
 if you're not touching.

00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:10.240
 - What do you mean?

00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:11.120
 - Oh yeah, true.

00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:13.120
 - But what if I feel lonely or scared?

00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:15.760
 - No, I do want to be holding hands with someone.

00:05:15.760 --> 00:05:18.560
 - They're the sacrifices you make to save these things.

00:05:18.560 --> 00:05:20.000
 - Someone else can't even help me have a piss

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:21.520
 because they've got their arms in the kitchen.

00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:23.600
 - Well, there's got to be, I've got it.

00:05:23.600 --> 00:05:24.960
 There's got to be an external agent

00:05:24.960 --> 00:05:27.120
 who's free to go around helping people have a piss.

00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:28.560
 - There was one piss helper, yes.

00:05:28.560 --> 00:05:32.320
 - What do we need to do then is arrest the piss assistant

00:05:33.200 --> 00:05:34.480
 and then the whole protest falls apart.

00:05:34.480 --> 00:05:38.640
 - Yeah, they all wet themselves and it's over.

00:05:38.640 --> 00:05:40.240
 - And that's how all protests tend.

00:05:40.240 --> 00:05:41.840
 - I need the toilet, let's go.

00:05:41.840 --> 00:05:43.840
 I've wet myself, we're done for the day.

00:05:43.840 --> 00:05:44.880
 - How did it end then?

00:05:44.880 --> 00:05:47.040
 How did they actually un-tube them?

00:05:47.040 --> 00:05:47.840
 - They're still there.

00:05:47.840 --> 00:05:48.800
 - They're still there.

00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:49.760
 - They're still there.

00:05:49.760 --> 00:05:51.440
 - I've claimed stuck in the middle.

00:05:51.440 --> 00:05:54.640
 They tried to prosecute them on.

00:05:54.640 --> 00:05:56.480
 Some, actually, anti-terrorism charges

00:05:56.480 --> 00:05:57.760
 before our judge a couple of years ago.

00:05:57.760 --> 00:05:59.040
 So that's fucking ridiculous.

00:05:59.040 --> 00:06:00.240
 These guys aren't terrorists.

00:06:00.240 --> 00:06:02.720
 But they were extracted from the pipes first.

00:06:02.720 --> 00:06:04.480
 I don't think anyone's still walking around with the pipes.

00:06:04.480 --> 00:06:05.200
 - Catch their arms.

00:06:05.200 --> 00:06:09.600
 - If you are writing, oh, you can't, probably.

00:06:09.600 --> 00:06:12.480
 - If your piss helper is free,

00:06:12.480 --> 00:06:14.160
 they ask if they can drop us a line.

00:06:14.160 --> 00:06:19.840
 - Is a stanza to Gatwick that's won the award for best toilet

00:06:19.840 --> 00:06:20.880
 like multiple years?

00:06:20.880 --> 00:06:22.240
 - I can't be stanced at.

00:06:22.240 --> 00:06:22.800
 - No?

00:06:22.800 --> 00:06:26.880
 - Unless they're talking about the entire app policy

00:06:26.880 --> 00:06:27.600
 for the toilet.

00:06:27.600 --> 00:06:29.680
 - Is it, can I ask that?

00:06:29.680 --> 00:06:32.480
 Is it an individual cubicle or is it a design of toilet?

00:06:32.480 --> 00:06:33.680
 - No, no, it's the whole toilet.

00:06:33.680 --> 00:06:34.560
 It's the cleanliness.

00:06:34.560 --> 00:06:37.440
 It's in the window as you go down into the toilets.

00:06:37.440 --> 00:06:38.800
 You know, you walked in and go, wow.

00:06:38.800 --> 00:06:40.720
 - Wait, there's a window as you go down to the toilet.

00:06:40.720 --> 00:06:42.080
 - Yeah, it's a little cabinet where they keep it.

00:06:42.080 --> 00:06:44.240
 - It's a viewing, does your toilet have a viewing though?

00:06:44.240 --> 00:06:45.440
 - It should.

00:06:45.440 --> 00:06:52.480
 - Can I give you a music recommendation related to this fact?

00:06:52.480 --> 00:06:53.280
 - Yes, please.

00:06:53.280 --> 00:06:54.720
 - It's my favorite song I found recently.

00:06:54.720 --> 00:06:57.200
 So in 1978, for sure, some listeners remember,

00:06:57.200 --> 00:06:59.520
 there was the big frequency change

00:06:59.520 --> 00:07:01.360
 where all of the radio stations in the UK,

00:07:01.360 --> 00:07:02.640
 all the big BBC ones,

00:07:02.640 --> 00:07:04.080
 hops to a different frequency

00:07:04.080 --> 00:07:06.800
 because of e-regulations.

00:07:06.800 --> 00:07:09.120
 And no one had the internet then.

00:07:09.120 --> 00:07:10.880
 So it was like, how are they going to know

00:07:10.880 --> 00:07:12.960
 that their station is at a different frequency,

00:07:12.960 --> 00:07:14.720
 especially given that.

00:07:14.720 --> 00:07:17.280
 I believe Radio 3 hopped the frequency

00:07:17.280 --> 00:07:18.960
 that used to be Radio 1.

00:07:18.960 --> 00:07:21.760
 So you'd tune in hoping for Tony Blackburn

00:07:21.760 --> 00:07:23.440
 and you'd get, in certain name,

00:07:23.440 --> 00:07:26.720
 with famous Radio 3 presenter in the 1970s.

00:07:26.720 --> 00:07:28.320
 - I honestly thought the Tony Blackburn

00:07:28.320 --> 00:07:29.920
 was currently on Radio 3 with you.

00:07:29.920 --> 00:07:32.640
 - He might be, he might be.

00:07:32.640 --> 00:07:34.560
 And the only reason I know it's him is because

00:07:34.560 --> 00:07:36.320
 one of the things they did to tell people was

00:07:36.320 --> 00:07:40.880
 Tony Blackburn stayed at Radio 3 for the day to tell people

00:07:40.880 --> 00:07:42.160
 a bit like if you move house,

00:07:42.160 --> 00:07:44.480
 you stay at the house that you've just moved out of.

00:07:44.480 --> 00:07:46.400
 So when your mates come around, you can go,

00:07:46.400 --> 00:07:47.680
 "I don't live here anymore."

00:07:47.680 --> 00:07:49.200
 So if you tuned in, he'd be like,

00:07:49.200 --> 00:07:50.400
 "Hello, it's me, Tony.

00:07:50.400 --> 00:07:51.680
 I'm not here anymore, though."

00:07:51.680 --> 00:07:52.880
 - That's not confusing at all.

00:07:52.880 --> 00:07:54.720
 - Go to the stage.

00:07:54.720 --> 00:07:56.800
 - Well, they get someone else to say,

00:07:56.800 --> 00:07:58.240
 Tony doesn't live here anymore.

00:07:58.240 --> 00:08:00.720
 - If you want him, he's on Radio 1.

00:08:00.720 --> 00:08:02.080
 - It's just a dedicated guy.

00:08:02.080 --> 00:08:03.680
 - That's great, that's so good.

00:08:03.680 --> 00:08:05.920
 - It was also this incredible song

00:08:05.920 --> 00:08:08.000
 by the King Singers, who are very famous

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:10.560
 at the time, Accapella Group from King's College Cambridge.

00:08:10.560 --> 00:08:12.800
 They released a single to help people remember

00:08:12.800 --> 00:08:14.160
 all the new frequencies.

00:08:14.160 --> 00:08:16.720
 And you've got to look at that.

00:08:16.720 --> 00:08:17.840
 It's beautiful.

00:08:17.840 --> 00:08:20.480
 It starts, just I'll just give you the first line.

00:08:20.480 --> 00:08:23.360
 A new international agreement comes into effect.

00:08:23.360 --> 00:08:26.240
 And many of the frequencies used for the BBC

00:08:26.240 --> 00:08:29.040
 will be changed at a time.

00:08:29.040 --> 00:08:30.800
 I think it was unlike that.

00:08:30.800 --> 00:08:32.800
 - Is that the tune, or are you just riff that?

00:08:32.800 --> 00:08:34.240
 - It's a bit like that.

00:08:34.240 --> 00:08:36.240
 It's like, Accapella Church music.

00:08:36.240 --> 00:08:37.040
 - Wow.

00:08:37.040 --> 00:08:39.680
 - But it told everyone what frequencies to go to.

00:08:39.680 --> 00:08:41.600
 - I reckon, because it said at a time,

00:08:41.600 --> 00:08:43.040
 that was a really weird way of saying it.

00:08:43.040 --> 00:08:46.480
 But the frequency for Radio 1 was 97 to 99.

00:08:46.480 --> 00:08:49.280
 So was it that it was a rhyme if that was it?

00:08:49.280 --> 00:08:52.080
 - They were actually different frequencies at the time.

00:08:52.080 --> 00:08:56.640
 And so it's, and there wasn't that much rhyming in this.

00:08:56.640 --> 00:08:58.720
 I must say much like a lot of songs.

00:08:58.720 --> 00:09:01.760
 - The whole point of putting things in a song

00:09:01.760 --> 00:09:04.240
 to help you remember, is it make them rhyme?

00:09:04.240 --> 00:09:06.400
 - There's no way it makes it easier whatsoever.

00:09:06.400 --> 00:09:07.920
 It's just a string of numbers,

00:09:07.920 --> 00:09:09.200
 somewhere much require boys.

00:09:09.200 --> 00:09:13.120
 - There were two.

00:09:13.120 --> 00:09:16.800
 In fact, the world's only two female fighter pilot aces,

00:09:16.800 --> 00:09:17.840
 which I think to be an ace,

00:09:17.840 --> 00:09:19.440
 you sort of had to shoot down five planes

00:09:19.440 --> 00:09:21.360
 or more vaguely varied.

00:09:21.360 --> 00:09:24.240
 But one of them was this woman called Lillia Litviak,

00:09:24.240 --> 00:09:26.640
 who was in one of the other regiments

00:09:26.640 --> 00:09:29.920
 that were flying for the Soviets in the Second World War.

00:09:29.920 --> 00:09:32.560
 And there was just an account which she recounted

00:09:32.560 --> 00:09:34.400
 and people who were in the same regiment as her recounted,

00:09:34.400 --> 00:09:35.760
 which sounds really fun,

00:09:35.760 --> 00:09:40.320
 where she was in this dogfight with a German called Irvenmeier.

00:09:40.320 --> 00:09:42.160
 And he'd shot down 12 planes before.

00:09:42.160 --> 00:09:44.480
 So he was well up there in ace territory.

00:09:44.480 --> 00:09:47.840
 And she defeated him really resoundingly.

00:09:47.840 --> 00:09:49.520
 And then it sounds like there's one of those nice moments

00:09:49.520 --> 00:09:51.680
 where he came right down, he was okay.

00:09:51.680 --> 00:09:55.360
 But he was like, who the hell defeats me?

00:09:55.360 --> 00:09:59.360
 Introduce me to the man who just bested me.

00:09:59.360 --> 00:10:01.040
 And so they trotted him up.

00:10:01.040 --> 00:10:02.000
 Yeah, did you read about this?

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:03.360
 - No, I'm just excited.

00:10:03.360 --> 00:10:05.120
 - Yeah, go on.

00:10:05.120 --> 00:10:08.320
 - So he got shot down, but he landed okay or?

00:10:08.320 --> 00:10:09.760
 - He landed okay in that way.

00:10:09.760 --> 00:10:11.280
 People seem to sometimes survive.

00:10:11.280 --> 00:10:13.840
 And demanded to be taken to the man who shot him down.

00:10:13.840 --> 00:10:15.360
 - Yeah, I was so presumptuous.

00:10:15.360 --> 00:10:16.560
 - I know.

00:10:16.560 --> 00:10:19.200
 - I just think you don't automatically get to meet the person

00:10:19.200 --> 00:10:19.840
 who shot you down.

00:10:19.840 --> 00:10:23.200
 - That's not my voice for you.

00:10:23.200 --> 00:10:24.880
 - You've got to follow themselves.

00:10:24.880 --> 00:10:26.640
 - Yeah, he was pissed off.

00:10:26.640 --> 00:10:28.080
 He was introduced to a woman, he said,

00:10:28.080 --> 00:10:29.200
 "Bugger off, guys, come on.

00:10:29.200 --> 00:10:30.000
 Where's the real guy?

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:31.040
 Stop taking a piss."

00:10:31.040 --> 00:10:32.320
 - Very funny, okay, yeah.

00:10:32.320 --> 00:10:34.320
 That happened to Mary Ellis,

00:10:34.320 --> 00:10:35.440
 who was another of the 88 girls.

00:10:35.440 --> 00:10:36.720
 She landed a Wellington bomber,

00:10:36.720 --> 00:10:38.720
 which was a black and huge plane at the time,

00:10:38.720 --> 00:10:40.000
 at an RAF base.

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:43.120
 And the staff said, "Oh great, so where's the pilot?"

00:10:43.120 --> 00:10:44.720
 And she said, "Oh, I'm the pilot."

00:10:44.720 --> 00:10:46.640
 And they point blank refused to believe it,

00:10:46.640 --> 00:10:48.640
 to the extent of searching the plane,

00:10:48.640 --> 00:10:50.160
 because they thought they were being pranked.

00:10:50.160 --> 00:10:51.440
 But there's no way this would work.

00:10:51.440 --> 00:10:54.640
 - And he also does that on just normal domestic flights.

00:10:54.640 --> 00:10:56.240
 If it's a woman who comes up at the time,

00:10:56.240 --> 00:10:59.200
 he's like, "Come on, let's get the real one on."

00:10:59.200 --> 00:11:01.600
 - Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:11:01.600 --> 00:11:04.000
 Dolores Moghrin, she became a pilot after the war.

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:06.240
 She wasn't allowed to say, "This is your captain speaking."

00:11:06.240 --> 00:11:07.680
 - What? - Because people would freak out

00:11:07.680 --> 00:11:10.480
 and presumably storm the cockpit or whatever.

00:11:10.480 --> 00:11:11.840
 - Yes.

00:11:11.840 --> 00:11:14.400
 - Can I just say, "I'm never quite sure on airplanes."

00:11:14.400 --> 00:11:16.080
 When they say, "This is your captain."

00:11:16.080 --> 00:11:18.080
 I'm never sure if it's the person who's piloting

00:11:18.080 --> 00:11:20.080
 and plane speaking, all the head of the steward

00:11:20.080 --> 00:11:21.280
 and stewardessing staff.

00:11:21.280 --> 00:11:23.280
 - I think it's the captain. - Yeah, it's the person piloting.

00:11:23.280 --> 00:11:25.120
 - When they say, "This is the captain speaking,"

00:11:25.120 --> 00:11:27.120
 generally speaking, it's the captain.

00:11:27.120 --> 00:11:28.880
 - It's not the stewardess.

00:11:28.880 --> 00:11:31.280
 - Unless they say, "This is the captain of catering speaking."

00:11:31.280 --> 00:11:35.120
 You will receive your cups of tea very shortly.

00:11:35.120 --> 00:11:38.080
 Just texting at the moment to the airport, actually.

00:11:38.080 --> 00:11:39.440
 - There's going to be a little bit of turbulence

00:11:39.440 --> 00:11:40.880
 on the trolley this afternoon,

00:11:40.880 --> 00:11:42.960
 but we're going to get your drinks to you.

00:11:44.080 --> 00:11:45.840
 - No, who invented Larson Found Officers?

00:11:45.840 --> 00:11:48.160
 - Is it someone... - It's my famous.

00:11:48.160 --> 00:11:49.520
 - Is this guy called Conan Doyle?

00:11:49.520 --> 00:11:50.960
 - Winston Doyle. - It's always Conan Doyle.

00:11:50.960 --> 00:11:52.240
 - Neither of those two.

00:11:52.240 --> 00:11:54.000
 But it's someone more famous, in fact,

00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:55.600
 than either of those two, I would say.

00:11:55.600 --> 00:11:57.120
 - Thanks to the Winston Churchill. - Genghis Khan.

00:11:57.120 --> 00:11:58.400
 - Jesus. - John Wayne.

00:11:58.400 --> 00:12:00.400
 - It was Napoleon Donapat.

00:12:00.400 --> 00:12:02.240
 - Oh, I forgot. - Oh, wow.

00:12:02.240 --> 00:12:03.200
 - Sorry, Andy.

00:12:03.200 --> 00:12:04.720
 - Napoleon won? - Yeah.

00:12:04.720 --> 00:12:05.440
 - I can't even walk.

00:12:05.440 --> 00:12:06.400
 You're saying he invented now what?

00:12:06.400 --> 00:12:07.920
 - Larson Found. - Larson Found.

00:12:07.920 --> 00:12:09.120
 - Yeah. - It's been so long.

00:12:09.120 --> 00:12:10.240
 - Part of his thing,

00:12:10.240 --> 00:12:13.600
 like Napoleon was bringing everything to Paris,

00:12:13.600 --> 00:12:16.960
 kind of thing, like centralising the whole country.

00:12:16.960 --> 00:12:20.480
 And as part of that, he set up an office on the Yildesitay

00:12:20.480 --> 00:12:22.880
 for lost objects, and it still exists.

00:12:22.880 --> 00:12:26.000
 - Cool. - And they have a cabinet of curiosities

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:27.760
 that include several human skulls,

00:12:27.760 --> 00:12:31.040
 a wooden leg, and two chunks of masonry

00:12:31.040 --> 00:12:32.320
 from the World Trade Centre.

00:12:32.320 --> 00:12:34.960
 And can you believe that?

00:12:34.960 --> 00:12:36.880
 - Well, that's somehow got lost.

00:12:36.880 --> 00:12:39.280
 - Yeah. - Well, that's the thing with Larson Found.

00:12:39.280 --> 00:12:40.720
 You don't know how it got there, right?

00:12:40.720 --> 00:12:43.280
 - How do they know the masonry is from the World Trade Centre?

00:12:44.080 --> 00:12:45.120
 - There must be clues.

00:12:45.120 --> 00:12:46.800
 - They've properly analysed that.

00:12:46.800 --> 00:12:47.600
 Wow.

00:12:47.600 --> 00:12:48.800
 - I guess so. - That was amazing.

00:12:48.800 --> 00:12:51.200
 - Yeah. - And the modern system there

00:12:51.200 --> 00:12:53.840
 was organised by a guy called Louis Lapine,

00:12:53.840 --> 00:12:56.800
 who was known as the Little Man with a big stick.

00:12:56.800 --> 00:13:00.480
 And he was a French policeman,

00:13:00.480 --> 00:13:04.160
 and he was well known for handling the crowds in Paris,

00:13:04.160 --> 00:13:05.600
 whenever there was riots and stuff.

00:13:05.600 --> 00:13:10.240
 But he was also famous for accusing

00:13:10.240 --> 00:13:14.000
 friend of the podcast, a polinear of stealing the Mona Lisa.

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:15.920
 Do you remember that story?

00:13:15.920 --> 00:13:17.120
 - Yeah, and the cast. - And the reason,

00:13:17.120 --> 00:13:18.320
 I'm sure you're very familiar.

00:13:18.320 --> 00:13:20.400
 - Yes, this was episode 300.

00:13:20.400 --> 00:13:21.440
 - He chose what sort of thing.

00:13:21.440 --> 00:13:22.960
 That was a very good one.

00:13:22.960 --> 00:13:24.880
 - I enjoyed that. - I think I was driving

00:13:24.880 --> 00:13:26.240
 from Patnie.

00:13:26.240 --> 00:13:28.640
 - He had an accident.

00:13:28.640 --> 00:13:32.320
 - But yeah, he was like really famous

00:13:32.320 --> 00:13:34.080
 and really well respected.

00:13:34.080 --> 00:13:34.880
 But when this...

00:13:34.880 --> 00:13:35.520
 - A big stick.

00:13:35.520 --> 00:13:37.120
 - A big stick.

00:13:37.120 --> 00:13:38.880
 - They had to respect him, yeah.

00:13:38.880 --> 00:13:40.480
 But when this Mona Lisa thing happened,

00:13:40.480 --> 00:13:42.240
 he lost all of his credibility, really.

00:13:42.240 --> 00:13:44.800
 - The police officer, Lapine.

00:13:44.800 --> 00:13:46.720
 - They say when you've got with the Mona Lisa,

00:13:46.720 --> 00:13:49.120
 because it's been stolen quite a few times.

00:13:49.120 --> 00:13:50.160
 But every time,

00:13:50.160 --> 00:13:53.280
 it doesn't matter where you're coming from to steal it,

00:13:53.280 --> 00:13:55.120
 the painting can see you.

00:13:55.120 --> 00:13:59.440
 - And this is actually a good hint,

00:13:59.440 --> 00:14:03.040
 the only way to get it without her seeing you

00:14:03.040 --> 00:14:04.160
 is going from behind.

00:14:04.160 --> 00:14:06.480
 - And that's the wall.

00:14:07.760 --> 00:14:09.520
 - Don't take that advice out of context, please.

00:14:09.520 --> 00:14:15.680
 - Just on like early trends in general,

00:14:15.680 --> 00:14:19.360
 have you heard about railway madmen?

00:14:19.360 --> 00:14:22.240
 - This was a... - Oh, was it like spinoff?

00:14:22.240 --> 00:14:22.960
 - Yeah.

00:14:22.960 --> 00:14:31.520
 - What was that?

00:14:31.520 --> 00:14:34.240
 - It was the opening theme.

00:14:37.440 --> 00:14:39.520
 - This was the thing, when trains were introduced,

00:14:39.520 --> 00:14:41.520
 and growing, there was railway mania,

00:14:41.520 --> 00:14:43.120
 which was when everyone was just building trains,

00:14:43.120 --> 00:14:44.800
 across the UK in particular,

00:14:44.800 --> 00:14:47.680
 with no thought of whether they needed to be a train, basically.

00:14:47.680 --> 00:14:49.520
 - No, they got given huge subsidies

00:14:49.520 --> 00:14:51.200
 for building train tracks and stuff.

00:14:51.200 --> 00:14:53.600
 - For a while, it was the most profitable thing you could do.

00:14:53.600 --> 00:14:55.600
 So people were just building mad little railways

00:14:55.600 --> 00:14:57.200
 everywhere, thousands of miles.

00:14:57.200 --> 00:14:59.360
 But railway madmen was a different thing.

00:14:59.360 --> 00:15:01.680
 People were worried at the time of social change,

00:15:01.680 --> 00:15:04.960
 and you were locked in the compartments.

00:15:04.960 --> 00:15:05.920
 That was another thing.

00:15:05.920 --> 00:15:09.440
 So people really freaked out at the prospect of train travel,

00:15:09.440 --> 00:15:10.720
 making people lose their way.

00:15:10.720 --> 00:15:12.400
 It's specifically man as well,

00:15:12.400 --> 00:15:15.200
 and just go bananas and berserk, basically.

00:15:15.200 --> 00:15:17.040
 - Yeah. - 'Cause of the speed you were going?

00:15:17.040 --> 00:15:18.160
 'Cause of the speed...

00:15:18.160 --> 00:15:20.480
 - Also, it enclosed in tunnels a lot.

00:15:20.480 --> 00:15:21.680
 I think that was a problem.

00:15:21.680 --> 00:15:22.640
 - There was a lot of...

00:15:22.640 --> 00:15:24.800
 Yeah, there's a historian called Amy Millen Smith,

00:15:24.800 --> 00:15:28.000
 and she did a fantastic report on this,

00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:29.600
 like a thesis about it.

00:15:29.600 --> 00:15:32.640
 So it was normal men who were completely fine,

00:15:32.640 --> 00:15:34.480
 but it was partly all the stuff you said, James,

00:15:34.480 --> 00:15:37.360
 and partly stress and overwork and anxiety of mod...

00:15:37.360 --> 00:15:39.760
 Like just modern life, the modern condition,

00:15:39.760 --> 00:15:42.800
 meant that, you know, in 1869, a gentleman suddenly

00:15:42.800 --> 00:15:44.800
 took off all his clothing and leaned out of the windows

00:15:44.800 --> 00:15:46.800
 of his carriage, talking nonsense, you know.

00:15:46.800 --> 00:15:49.760
 And it was just apparently as soon as the train stopped,

00:15:49.760 --> 00:15:51.760
 or they got off the train, they completely recovered their wits,

00:15:51.760 --> 00:15:52.320
 and they were fine.

00:15:52.320 --> 00:15:54.320
 It was literally the act of being on a moving train.

00:15:54.320 --> 00:15:57.040
 - Now hang on, can I button with...

00:15:57.040 --> 00:16:00.240
 Is there anything to do with sitting backwards on a train?

00:16:00.240 --> 00:16:03.520
 - Oh, don't worry. - They looked into that scientific issue whereby

00:16:03.520 --> 00:16:06.800
 it could drive you mad if you're always facing the wrong way

00:16:06.800 --> 00:16:08.400
 and going in a certain direction.

00:16:08.400 --> 00:16:10.240
 - Yeah. - And I hope it's going backwards on a train.

00:16:10.240 --> 00:16:11.920
 - It feels sick, yeah, yeah. - It's you.

00:16:11.920 --> 00:16:13.600
 - Yeah, none of you guys. - I love it.

00:16:13.600 --> 00:16:16.240
 - Well, yeah, I'm not a fan of it.

00:16:16.240 --> 00:16:19.280
 So I think it could be linked to a bit of madness that might come.

00:16:19.280 --> 00:16:21.120
 - I prefer it. I prefer seeing backwards on my...

00:16:21.120 --> 00:16:22.720
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah. - I actually prefer it as well,

00:16:22.720 --> 00:16:24.560
 because if you crash head on to something,

00:16:24.560 --> 00:16:26.320
 then you have something to stop you from...

00:16:26.320 --> 00:16:27.200
 - Oh, y'all crash theory.

00:16:27.200 --> 00:16:27.920
 - Yeah.

00:16:27.920 --> 00:16:31.760
 - And don't think backwards crash theory. - Yeah, yeah, that's interesting.

00:16:31.760 --> 00:16:35.040
 - So you think James that they should put all the seats in a car backwards, presumably?

00:16:35.040 --> 00:16:37.600
 - Well, I think I'm not the only person who thinks that.

00:16:37.600 --> 00:16:39.040
 - Really? - I mean, that is safer.

00:16:39.040 --> 00:16:40.400
 - Except the driver seat, presumably.

00:16:40.400 --> 00:16:45.040
 - Just don't hold the cars reverse everywhere.

00:16:45.040 --> 00:16:46.400
 - Yeah.

00:16:46.400 --> 00:16:48.240
 - That's... yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:16:48.240 --> 00:16:50.320
 - Just lean around. You're arm over the other seat.

00:16:50.320 --> 00:16:51.440
 You do that classic move.

00:16:51.440 --> 00:16:52.800
 - Yes, nice, nice. - Yeah.

00:16:52.800 --> 00:16:54.560
 - Everyone would drive a lot more slowly.

00:16:54.560 --> 00:16:55.280
 - Yeah. - Just safer.

00:16:56.880 --> 00:16:59.520
 - Do you guys know a right-handed batter called...

00:16:59.520 --> 00:17:05.840
 Lassa Rousseau, Talibula, Minerva, Lenny Vé Vaca,

00:17:05.840 --> 00:17:09.760
 Boulin, Miner, Kula, Cala, Kebalau?

00:17:09.760 --> 00:17:11.600
 - Yes, of course. - Yeah, I have his shirt,

00:17:11.600 --> 00:17:13.760
 but it can't be a fortune to get his name on the pack.

00:17:13.760 --> 00:17:16.640
 Is that... - I don't know him.

00:17:16.640 --> 00:17:19.040
 - Is it a real name of someone we have heard of?

00:17:19.040 --> 00:17:19.840
 - No, no, it's not.

00:17:19.840 --> 00:17:21.200
 It's just the longest crooked, his name ever,

00:17:21.200 --> 00:17:23.200
 but he's just a pacific ricketer from Fiji.

00:17:23.200 --> 00:17:24.880
 And he sounds like a great guy.

00:17:24.880 --> 00:17:26.240
 Larger because of his long name.

00:17:26.240 --> 00:17:28.560
 His surname means "Returned Alive"

00:17:28.560 --> 00:17:31.520
 from Nancula Hospital at La Kemba Island in the Lao Group,

00:17:31.520 --> 00:17:34.640
 which is easier to pronounce if you want to do it that way.

00:17:34.640 --> 00:17:36.480
 - Last members for the Lao Group, please.

00:17:36.480 --> 00:17:37.760
 Last members for the Lao Group.

00:17:37.760 --> 00:17:41.120
 Buses departing shortly.

00:17:41.120 --> 00:17:44.880
 But yeah, he was great.

00:17:44.880 --> 00:17:45.600
 He used to...

00:17:45.600 --> 00:17:47.120
 They played one international game, Fiji,

00:17:47.120 --> 00:17:50.640
 against New Zealand in the 1940s and '50s when he played.

00:17:50.640 --> 00:17:54.160
 And they made him serenade them with South Sea songs after the match,

00:17:54.160 --> 00:17:55.200
 which he did.

00:17:55.200 --> 00:17:57.360
 A game, lovely man, I know.

00:17:57.360 --> 00:18:02.960
 - You know that it took 120 years after the invention of the cricket box

00:18:02.960 --> 00:18:04.960
 to invent the cricket helmet.

00:18:04.960 --> 00:18:07.680
 - Okay.

00:18:07.680 --> 00:18:09.680
 - I like to post that show to people's priorities.

00:18:09.680 --> 00:18:11.200
 - Pretty much. - Why, doesn't it?

00:18:11.200 --> 00:18:12.080
 - Would you agree with that?

00:18:12.080 --> 00:18:15.040
 - I'd have thought, yeah, even terms of what you're keen on.

00:18:15.040 --> 00:18:16.160
 I suppose it...

00:18:16.160 --> 00:18:17.440
 - You've got a skull.

00:18:17.440 --> 00:18:19.040
 You don't have a penis skull.

00:18:19.040 --> 00:18:21.040
 - You don't have a genital exoskeleton.

00:18:21.040 --> 00:18:21.840
 - Exactly.

00:18:21.840 --> 00:18:22.720
 - Yeah.

00:18:22.720 --> 00:18:27.280
 - We're hoping these less than the guys can do something.

00:18:27.280 --> 00:18:32.560
 - The ball is generally going to be in the lower part of your body.

00:18:32.560 --> 00:18:33.600
 - Amid ships.

00:18:33.600 --> 00:18:34.240
 - Yeah.

00:18:34.240 --> 00:18:37.600
 - Well, it's absolutely about how bouncing the surface as well, isn't it?

00:18:37.600 --> 00:18:40.000
 These days it's very bouncing because they're protective and stuff.

00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:41.520
 But if it was opened to the elements at the time,

00:18:41.520 --> 00:18:43.280
 the bounce could be variable.

00:18:43.280 --> 00:18:44.640
 It's more lighty to be lower and slower,

00:18:44.640 --> 00:18:45.840
 so you'd be more lighty to take one.

00:18:45.840 --> 00:18:47.040
 And the plums than in the noggin.

00:18:49.600 --> 00:18:54.480
 - Yeah, about 1850s was the Palner's patent-growing protector, as it was called,

00:18:54.480 --> 00:18:56.880
 before that you'd just stuff a hanky down there to improvise it.

00:18:56.880 --> 00:18:58.960
 But it was only in the 1970s.

00:18:58.960 --> 00:19:00.720
 - It was your hanky made out of Kevlar or what?

00:19:00.720 --> 00:19:01.360
 - Thank you.

00:19:01.360 --> 00:19:02.160
 - Yeah, yeah.

00:19:02.160 --> 00:19:04.160
 - But if it isn't very well used, hanky,

00:19:04.160 --> 00:19:05.360
 I think that can actually...

00:19:05.360 --> 00:19:07.360
 (laughing)

00:19:07.360 --> 00:19:09.360
 - It's hard to fold.

00:19:09.360 --> 00:19:13.680
 - A heavy head cold actually does protect you

00:19:13.680 --> 00:19:16.080
 in unpredictable ways, yeah.

00:19:16.080 --> 00:19:18.560
 And if there's any you could ever use the same one as a kind of gumbee hanky,

00:19:18.560 --> 00:19:19.920
 it's the first crooked helmet at the same time.

00:19:19.920 --> 00:19:21.120
 (laughing)

00:19:21.120 --> 00:19:22.640
 - It's so slanky tied and it's gone.

00:19:22.640 --> 00:19:25.440
 - Would you have a commentate on Cricket?

00:19:25.440 --> 00:19:26.240
 Well, I hope you'd done it.

00:19:26.240 --> 00:19:29.760
 - I think I have done online just briefly.

00:19:29.760 --> 00:19:33.280
 Yeah, it's quite, it's quite awesome responsibility to be perfectly honest.

00:19:33.280 --> 00:19:35.760
 If you're thinking, the other people can't see it, and I've really got to...

00:19:35.760 --> 00:19:36.400
 - Yeah.

00:19:36.400 --> 00:19:37.360
 - You know, like when you say to the drive in the left,

00:19:37.360 --> 00:19:38.720
 it's like, I can't see my left shoulder.

00:19:38.720 --> 00:19:40.240
 Can you tell me if there's anything coming down that hill?

00:19:40.240 --> 00:19:41.440
 (laughing)

00:19:41.440 --> 00:19:43.120
 It's that sort of pressure, but for hours.

00:19:43.120 --> 00:19:44.640
 - It's days.

00:19:44.640 --> 00:19:45.440
 - I mean, these people can be, you know,

00:19:45.440 --> 00:19:46.720
 they can be sort of several countries where

00:19:46.720 --> 00:19:48.480
 and I've got to describe what's going on.

00:19:48.480 --> 00:19:50.480
 I think it's more high pressure work than people imagine.

00:19:50.480 --> 00:19:52.080
 - Well, I did read a description of what it's like

00:19:52.080 --> 00:19:54.320
 commentating on something like Test Match Special.

00:19:54.320 --> 00:19:55.520
 I can't remember who it was who did it.

00:19:55.520 --> 00:19:57.120
 Well, like one of the famous commentators said,

00:19:57.120 --> 00:20:00.320
 "Look, this is the apex of human civilization.

00:20:00.320 --> 00:20:03.360
 "You're sitting observing a nice cricket match happening.

00:20:03.360 --> 00:20:05.040
 "People are sending in homemade cakes to you,

00:20:05.040 --> 00:20:08.160
 "which you can then review on there during a lull in play, basically."

00:20:08.160 --> 00:20:09.760
 - That the whole play is a lull.

00:20:09.760 --> 00:20:10.560
 - Yeah.

00:20:10.560 --> 00:20:12.000
 There's a sort of breathing space.

00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:13.920
 It's not like commentating on tennis or something like that,

00:20:13.920 --> 00:20:14.720
 which must be, you know.

00:20:14.720 --> 00:20:16.400
 - Have you a radio commentator for tennis?

00:20:16.400 --> 00:20:18.560
 That's a horse racing or whatever.

00:20:18.560 --> 00:20:19.400
 - Exactly.

00:20:19.400 --> 00:20:21.600
 - You know, your word per minute is just--

00:20:21.600 --> 00:20:23.360
 - Exactly, yeah, yeah, I've seen them.

00:20:23.360 --> 00:20:25.840
 - But this is, he was saying, I think it was a he.

00:20:25.840 --> 00:20:30.400
 You were either having to describe the immediate play,

00:20:30.400 --> 00:20:32.080
 which like if there's something going on,

00:20:32.080 --> 00:20:34.000
 you need to explain that really clearly to the listener,

00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:36.640
 like he was saying, and then during the quieter bits,

00:20:36.640 --> 00:20:38.680
 you're talking more about the overall shape of the game.

00:20:38.680 --> 00:20:39.760
 And during the really quiet bits,

00:20:39.760 --> 00:20:42.280
 he's talking about the grounds and the whole history

00:20:42.280 --> 00:20:43.120
 of cricket.

00:20:43.120 --> 00:20:44.520
 And so you've got three different modes

00:20:44.520 --> 00:20:47.080
 that you can switch between to a depending on what.

00:20:47.080 --> 00:20:48.920
 - Oh, you've got mode full, which is something

00:20:48.920 --> 00:20:50.040
 completely unrelated.

00:20:50.040 --> 00:20:51.880
 Have you guys ever seen the clip of,

00:20:51.880 --> 00:20:54.040
 it's the Australian commentator and he tells the joke

00:20:54.040 --> 00:20:57.400
 that it's a Nicknack party work, give the frog a loan.

00:20:57.400 --> 00:20:58.240
 - Right.

00:20:58.240 --> 00:20:59.720
 - Look at Daniel, is that a Keith?

00:20:59.720 --> 00:21:01.720
 - It's a Keith, it's Kerrio Keith.

00:21:01.720 --> 00:21:04.120
 And he's, and I can't, who he's commentating with,

00:21:04.120 --> 00:21:05.200
 but there's always a straight man

00:21:05.200 --> 00:21:06.520
 who's actually commentating on the cricket

00:21:06.520 --> 00:21:08.000
 and then, you know, someone more joking.

00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:10.200
 And he's trying to tell this very long joke

00:21:10.200 --> 00:21:12.680
 and the other commentator is trying to get in the way

00:21:12.680 --> 00:21:14.200
 and explain what's happening in the cricket.

00:21:14.200 --> 00:21:15.800
 And then every two minutes he says,

00:21:15.800 --> 00:21:16.760
 "And there's no run."

00:21:16.760 --> 00:21:19.560
 (laughter)

00:21:19.560 --> 00:21:21.920
 - That's where you use your elbow to test the temperature

00:21:21.920 --> 00:21:24.160
 of bath water, for instance, rather than your fingers aren't

00:21:24.160 --> 00:21:25.600
 actually very sensitive to people with their hands

00:21:25.600 --> 00:21:27.480
 and go, "That's okay, but it's not actually..."

00:21:27.480 --> 00:21:29.600
 - I feel like my hands are sensitive to temperature.

00:21:29.600 --> 00:21:30.760
 - I thought it was that your elbow is the

00:21:30.760 --> 00:21:32.040
 bit of you that's most like a baby.

00:21:32.040 --> 00:21:34.320
 - 'Cause I always wear gloves, I always wear gloves

00:21:34.320 --> 00:21:36.600
 when it's cold, I don't wear elbow patches.

00:21:36.600 --> 00:21:37.920
 - Oh, you should do it.

00:21:37.920 --> 00:21:39.600
 - You lose so much heat through your elbows.

00:21:39.600 --> 00:21:41.160
 - Yeah, yeah, but you're only, yeah.

00:21:41.160 --> 00:21:42.640
 - But also you're down the skatepark a lot,

00:21:42.640 --> 00:21:44.600
 you're called protective equipment.

00:21:44.600 --> 00:21:45.840
 So they're elbow guards.

00:21:45.840 --> 00:21:47.160
 You just don't think of them as well.

00:21:47.160 --> 00:21:48.000
 - Of course.

00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:50.320
 - What's the sport wear?

00:21:50.320 --> 00:21:51.680
 It's two villages versus another,

00:21:51.680 --> 00:21:53.720
 and it doesn't seem to be a limit on another.

00:21:53.720 --> 00:21:55.280
 And it's basically getting a ball from...

00:21:55.280 --> 00:21:56.120
 - Yeah.

00:21:56.120 --> 00:21:57.360
 - Two posts or something like that.

00:21:57.360 --> 00:21:58.200
 - Something that's getting from one thing.

00:21:58.200 --> 00:22:00.600
 - Oppies versus the Downies or opposite of the Downers.

00:22:00.600 --> 00:22:03.080
 And it's just like village football, really.

00:22:03.080 --> 00:22:05.680
 - But there's no limit on numbers on the Down.

00:22:05.680 --> 00:22:07.600
 - Well, I think these days the police limit

00:22:07.600 --> 00:22:08.600
 who can go.

00:22:08.600 --> 00:22:10.080
 (laughter)

00:22:10.080 --> 00:22:10.920
 - Yeah.

00:22:10.920 --> 00:22:13.200
 - I mean, those sort of sports wear

00:22:13.200 --> 00:22:14.040
 there's a flexibility.

00:22:14.040 --> 00:22:15.680
 Like how did it go?

00:22:15.680 --> 00:22:18.920
 La Cross, there's a sort of set length,

00:22:18.920 --> 00:22:21.200
 or parameters within which the length of a lacrosse pitch

00:22:21.200 --> 00:22:23.080
 must be, but actually there is no side boundary.

00:22:23.080 --> 00:22:25.560
 That's entirely based on where you happen to be playing.

00:22:25.560 --> 00:22:26.400
 - Yeah.

00:22:26.400 --> 00:22:27.240
 - So you can set off running in wonder,

00:22:27.240 --> 00:22:28.920
 and you can just keep going until there's an obstacle.

00:22:28.920 --> 00:22:30.520
 Essentially, that doesn't get out.

00:22:30.520 --> 00:22:31.360
 - Yeah, yeah, you can do that.

00:22:31.360 --> 00:22:32.200
 - We used to do that at school.

00:22:32.200 --> 00:22:34.320
 And I play football in the playground.

00:22:34.320 --> 00:22:35.560
 You would have one goal,

00:22:35.560 --> 00:22:38.080
 and you'd have two teams shooting towards the same goal.

00:22:38.080 --> 00:22:39.840
 And you would just get someone who would get the ball

00:22:39.840 --> 00:22:42.120
 I'd just run in the complete opposite direction

00:22:42.120 --> 00:22:44.840
 with the ball so everyone had to chase after them.

00:22:44.840 --> 00:22:48.400
 - It's quite, 'cause there's no boundaries.

00:22:48.400 --> 00:22:50.320
 - But that is true in official lacrosse rules.

00:22:50.320 --> 00:22:51.440
 I think it's just women's lacrosse.

00:22:51.440 --> 00:22:53.920
 I weirdly, I think men's lacrosse does have boundaries,

00:22:53.920 --> 00:22:54.760
 but women's lacrosse--

00:22:54.760 --> 00:22:55.600
 - Men need boundaries.

00:22:55.600 --> 00:22:56.440
 (laughter)

00:22:56.440 --> 00:22:57.600
 - It's good indeed.

00:22:57.600 --> 00:23:00.360
 - Wasn't it something about like the earliest games

00:23:00.360 --> 00:23:02.920
 of lacrosse had an insane number of people?

00:23:02.920 --> 00:23:05.320
 - The American lacrosse foundation claims

00:23:05.320 --> 00:23:07.960
 the earliest games could have over 100,000 players.

00:23:07.960 --> 00:23:08.800
 - Stop it.

00:23:09.800 --> 00:23:11.840
 - And try commentating on that.

00:23:11.840 --> 00:23:13.640
 - Or state of those changing rooms as well.

00:23:13.640 --> 00:23:15.400
 (laughter)

00:23:15.400 --> 00:23:17.880
 - But it's like the handshake before the game is going to take--

00:23:17.880 --> 00:23:19.200
 (laughter)

00:23:19.200 --> 00:23:21.560
 - But it's a sort of roughly tafty sport in America,

00:23:21.560 --> 00:23:22.920
 I think, isn't it, LaCrosse?

00:23:22.920 --> 00:23:25.520
 We might associate LaCrosse with sort of girls'

00:23:25.520 --> 00:23:26.360
 boarding schools.

00:23:26.360 --> 00:23:27.200
 - Yeah.

00:23:27.200 --> 00:23:28.040
 - In America, then it'd be--

00:23:28.040 --> 00:23:33.040
 - Well, 'cause women's lacrosse and men's lacrosse

00:23:33.040 --> 00:23:34.960
 are like just different games, aren't they?

00:23:34.960 --> 00:23:36.360
 - Yeah. - They have different rules, different.

00:23:36.360 --> 00:23:37.360
 - Yeah, totally different.

00:23:37.360 --> 00:23:38.440
 - But you wouldn't hear phrases like

00:23:38.440 --> 00:23:41.440
 roughty tafty in the men's lacrosse that they play in America,

00:23:41.440 --> 00:23:44.200
 for instance, whereas you might in the female boarding school

00:23:44.200 --> 00:23:45.720
 across the replay here.

00:23:45.720 --> 00:23:47.200
 I've never heard roughty tafty before.

00:23:47.200 --> 00:23:48.360
 - Well, why not exist as a different--

00:23:48.360 --> 00:23:49.360
 - No, the phrase. - No, the phrase.

00:23:49.360 --> 00:23:50.200
 - No, the phrase.

00:23:50.200 --> 00:23:51.040
 - No, no, no.

00:23:51.040 --> 00:23:51.880
 - Some sort of post-surgery.

00:23:51.880 --> 00:23:52.720
 (laughter)

00:23:52.720 --> 00:23:55.720
 - Even if it's a bubble that's a dessert.

00:23:55.720 --> 00:23:58.320
 - Oh, then animals, golden hamsters can navigate their way home,

00:23:58.320 --> 00:24:00.760
 even when blindfolded and let it a complicated route

00:24:00.760 --> 00:24:01.960
 away from their nests.

00:24:01.960 --> 00:24:02.960
 - Can they? How do they do it?

00:24:02.960 --> 00:24:03.800
 Do we know?

00:24:03.800 --> 00:24:06.320
 - No,, I don't think we do know.

00:24:06.320 --> 00:24:07.440
 - Oh, and it's really mysterious, isn't it?

00:24:07.440 --> 00:24:09.240
 Because it's, you know, some of these senses are not,

00:24:09.240 --> 00:24:10.360
 we don't fully understand.

00:24:10.360 --> 00:24:11.800
 So there's a thing called the,

00:24:11.800 --> 00:24:13.480
 oh, it's called the Reed Warbler bird.

00:24:13.480 --> 00:24:14.320
 - Oh, yeah.

00:24:14.320 --> 00:24:17.040
 - And the scientists wanted to disrupt,

00:24:17.040 --> 00:24:19.200
 they thought they must be using the Earth's magnetic field.

00:24:19.200 --> 00:24:20.800
 Okay, so we'll disrupt it.

00:24:20.800 --> 00:24:24.120
 So they attached small magnets to these birds' foreheads

00:24:24.120 --> 00:24:24.960
 in an experiment,

00:24:24.960 --> 00:24:26.680
 and they also blocked their view of the stars.

00:24:26.680 --> 00:24:29.560
 And, obviously, they couldn't navigate.

00:24:29.560 --> 00:24:30.400
 (laughter)

00:24:30.400 --> 00:24:31.920
 I don't really know what that proves.

00:24:31.920 --> 00:24:32.760
 (laughter)

00:24:32.760 --> 00:24:35.000
 - The homing pigeons used to use in the war

00:24:35.000 --> 00:24:37.280
 to work out where sort of various ships were in things.

00:24:37.280 --> 00:24:38.960
 Because they had their homing instincts.

00:24:38.960 --> 00:24:41.440
 And they would know that they would fly

00:24:41.440 --> 00:24:43.120
 at a very particular pace.

00:24:43.120 --> 00:24:44.760
 And they would know what time they were released.

00:24:44.760 --> 00:24:45.800
 And so they're there for,

00:24:45.800 --> 00:24:47.600
 and the angle from which they basically arrived.

00:24:47.600 --> 00:24:50.800
 They could work out how far away from that distance.

00:24:50.800 --> 00:24:51.640
 - Really?

00:24:51.640 --> 00:24:52.680
 - You'd work out the maths backwards.

00:24:52.680 --> 00:24:54.200
 So they've arrived from over there.

00:24:54.200 --> 00:24:55.440
 They set off at this time.

00:24:55.440 --> 00:24:56.400
 So they must have there for,

00:24:56.400 --> 00:24:57.240
 that's the way they work.

00:24:57.240 --> 00:24:58.240
 - I usually have a 20-hour.

00:24:58.240 --> 00:25:00.680
 - But how do they know where they set off from?

00:25:00.680 --> 00:25:02.680
 - 'Cause they're going to note on them.

00:25:02.680 --> 00:25:04.480
 - Oh, what time they set off?

00:25:04.480 --> 00:25:06.480
 - Well, that information must be,

00:25:06.480 --> 00:25:07.760
 yes, I was going to say that must be radio,

00:25:07.760 --> 00:25:08.760
 but then presumably the people radioing

00:25:08.760 --> 00:25:10.000
 and say where they were.

00:25:10.000 --> 00:25:11.960
 But maybe, maybe there's so many internet.

00:25:11.960 --> 00:25:12.800
 Maybe everything.

00:25:12.800 --> 00:25:14.600
 Any radio signal you send can be intercepted.

00:25:14.600 --> 00:25:15.880
 But I'm not going to tell you where we are,

00:25:15.880 --> 00:25:17.760
 but it's 7.58 and I'm releasing the pigeon.

00:25:17.760 --> 00:25:18.760
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:25:18.760 --> 00:25:20.560
 - And then it's making that what you will.

00:25:20.560 --> 00:25:21.480
 (laughter)

00:25:21.480 --> 00:25:22.880
 - Good luck with that, yeah.

00:25:22.880 --> 00:25:25.120
 - Oh, Keith has gone off on one.

00:25:25.120 --> 00:25:27.120
 They were genuinely useful.

00:25:27.120 --> 00:25:28.280
 They were, they were, they were,

00:25:28.280 --> 00:25:29.240
 they were sort of called up.

00:25:29.240 --> 00:25:31.440
 People that were sort of looked after pigeons

00:25:31.440 --> 00:25:32.840
 were suddenly, they would, they were,

00:25:32.840 --> 00:25:33.960
 they hide him on for them.

00:25:33.960 --> 00:25:36.440
 - Yeah, suddenly we went from complete weirdo loners

00:25:36.440 --> 00:25:39.840
 to very sought after people, I'm so sorry.

00:25:39.840 --> 00:25:40.680
 - Oh my God.

00:25:40.680 --> 00:25:42.200
 - That's not how I feel about pigeon fancies, really.

00:25:42.200 --> 00:25:44.240
 - For our audience are in the pigeon loft at the moment.

00:25:44.240 --> 00:25:45.080
 - I know.

00:25:45.080 --> 00:25:45.920
 - Yeah, yeah.

00:25:45.920 --> 00:25:48.480
 - I've got on satire.

00:25:48.480 --> 00:25:51.200
 You know, tatler, we're all subscribers.

00:25:51.200 --> 00:25:52.040
 - Of course.

00:25:52.040 --> 00:25:52.880
 - Yeah.

00:25:52.880 --> 00:25:54.320
 - That was meant to be satirical.

00:25:54.320 --> 00:25:55.320
 (laughter)

00:25:55.320 --> 00:25:56.800
 It was meant to be taking the piss out of you.

00:25:56.800 --> 00:25:57.640
 - Can you explain what it is?

00:25:57.640 --> 00:25:58.640
 - Sorry for those of us.

00:25:58.640 --> 00:25:59.640
 - Sorry.

00:25:59.640 --> 00:26:00.480
 - We grew up in Bolton.

00:26:00.480 --> 00:26:02.000
 - Sorry.

00:26:02.000 --> 00:26:03.600
 It's really not your area.

00:26:03.600 --> 00:26:05.520
 - Right, world of interiors, but about people.

00:26:05.520 --> 00:26:07.960
 (laughter)

00:26:07.960 --> 00:26:09.600
 - So yes, tatler for international listeners

00:26:09.600 --> 00:26:11.920
 and anyone who's more civilized

00:26:11.920 --> 00:26:14.880
 is basically a magazine for high society.

00:26:14.880 --> 00:26:17.960
 It's like photographs of people who aren't quite

00:26:17.960 --> 00:26:19.840
 the royal family, 'cause they probably can't get access

00:26:19.840 --> 00:26:21.840
 to them, but who are mates with the royal family.

00:26:21.840 --> 00:26:22.680
 - Right, so.

00:26:22.680 --> 00:26:23.520
 - Having wedding.

00:26:23.520 --> 00:26:25.520
 - Is it tatler that's got, sort of on the back page,

00:26:25.520 --> 00:26:27.760
 there's always like a, it's not a high street honey,

00:26:27.760 --> 00:26:30.480
 but it's kind of a, it's like an eligible young lady

00:26:30.480 --> 00:26:32.320
 who is engaged.

00:26:32.320 --> 00:26:33.320
 I think maybe that's it, is like,

00:26:33.320 --> 00:26:34.320
 look at this beautiful young woman.

00:26:34.320 --> 00:26:35.160
 She's just gone engaged.

00:26:35.160 --> 00:26:36.000
 You can't get together with her.

00:26:36.000 --> 00:26:36.840
 - Oh, right.

00:26:36.840 --> 00:26:37.680
 - Is that it?

00:26:37.680 --> 00:26:38.520
 - Probably about, yeah.

00:26:38.520 --> 00:26:40.000
 I mean, it doesn't sound like any other magazine would have that.

00:26:40.000 --> 00:26:42.200
 - Yeah, like Country Life has a sort of,

00:26:42.200 --> 00:26:44.120
 yeah, it's made like a lady of the month.

00:26:44.120 --> 00:26:45.920
 - Maybe it's Country Life, I'm not talking about that.

00:26:45.920 --> 00:26:48.360
 - But yes, it's a sort of that with an RT black and white photo.

00:26:48.360 --> 00:26:49.200
 - Yes.

00:26:49.200 --> 00:26:51.840
 - And sometimes I think it's like single-hand looking.

00:26:51.840 --> 00:26:52.680
 - Really?

00:26:52.680 --> 00:26:54.240
 - And free available in your area.

00:26:54.240 --> 00:26:55.560
 - Oh, that kind of thing, isn't it?

00:26:55.560 --> 00:26:57.720
 - So this is the page three of...

00:26:57.720 --> 00:27:00.000
 - Except it's page like 128, 'cause of all the adverts

00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:01.000
 for posh watches.

00:27:01.000 --> 00:27:01.840
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:27:01.840 --> 00:27:02.680
 - And it's a monthly publication.

00:27:02.680 --> 00:27:04.480
 So it doesn't work in the way that's sort of Metro used to have

00:27:04.480 --> 00:27:06.760
 our eyes saw yesterday on the 802 from Voxelore,

00:27:06.760 --> 00:27:08.080
 but we're like, I think I saw you back.

00:27:08.080 --> 00:27:09.920
 Must have been, I must have been up for four months ago.

00:27:09.920 --> 00:27:11.120
 (laughing)

00:27:11.120 --> 00:27:12.520
 I think you admired my plowing.

00:27:12.520 --> 00:27:14.000
 (laughing)

00:27:14.000 --> 00:27:14.840
 - That's disgusting.

00:27:14.840 --> 00:27:15.680
 - I was.

00:27:15.680 --> 00:27:16.520
 - Oh, yeah.

00:27:16.520 --> 00:27:17.360
 - Rude of me.

00:27:17.360 --> 00:27:18.200
 - Yeah.

00:27:18.200 --> 00:27:20.000
 - Yeah, so what about time?

00:27:20.000 --> 00:27:20.840
 - Oh, yeah, sorry.

00:27:20.840 --> 00:27:23.640
 It was founded by a guy called Richard Steele

00:27:23.640 --> 00:27:26.200
 who called himself Isaac Bickerstaff

00:27:26.200 --> 00:27:27.360
 when he edited "Tatler"

00:27:27.360 --> 00:27:29.200
 and Isaac Bickerstaff, actually.

00:27:29.200 --> 00:27:30.480
 You'll remember the name James.

00:27:30.480 --> 00:27:31.720
 - I do know the name, but why?

00:27:31.720 --> 00:27:36.080
 - It was because Jonathan Swift, once published in 1708,

00:27:36.080 --> 00:27:38.560
 so another great, the other great probably satirist

00:27:38.560 --> 00:27:41.440
 at the time, published the "Almania" predictions of the year,

00:27:41.440 --> 00:27:44.880
 writing as Isaac Bickerstaff and he predicted the death

00:27:44.880 --> 00:27:48.600
 of this astrologer and society person called John Partridge.

00:27:48.600 --> 00:27:51.160
 And he predicted it on April 1st, it was an April 4th joke.

00:27:51.160 --> 00:27:52.800
 And this poor guy John Partridge,

00:27:52.800 --> 00:27:54.400
 who was a bit of a butt of jokes,

00:27:54.400 --> 00:27:56.760
 spent the rest of his life trying to convince people

00:27:56.760 --> 00:27:59.560
 that he wasn't dead and when this turned up.

00:27:59.560 --> 00:28:02.560
 And he wrote a letter saying, I'm not dead.

00:28:02.560 --> 00:28:04.440
 And Jonathan Swift said, well, that's a hoax

00:28:04.440 --> 00:28:07.000
 'cause he is, you know, seeing the body made.

00:28:07.000 --> 00:28:07.840
 - Yeah.

00:28:07.840 --> 00:28:09.480
 - It was an unkind time, a lot of sick burns

00:28:09.480 --> 00:28:11.280
 being dished out all over the place,

00:28:11.280 --> 00:28:12.960
 like saying one of the Irish are so hungry,

00:28:12.960 --> 00:28:14.320
 why don't they just eat their babies,

00:28:14.320 --> 00:28:15.320
 which was during the famine.

00:28:15.320 --> 00:28:17.920
 It was incredibly harsh satir.

00:28:17.920 --> 00:28:19.240
 - Right.

00:28:19.240 --> 00:28:20.960
 - Imagine that, imagine that,

00:28:20.960 --> 00:28:23.560
 'cause it sounds bad now, but it doesn't really love the famine.

00:28:23.560 --> 00:28:24.400
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah, no.

00:28:24.400 --> 00:28:25.240
 - It's actually even worse.

00:28:25.240 --> 00:28:26.600
 - It's pitch black, exactly.

00:28:26.600 --> 00:28:28.040
 He's trying to draw attention to the famine.

00:28:28.040 --> 00:28:30.000
 And, you know, the awful cruelty that has caused it.

00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:31.040
 But he's, you know,

00:28:31.040 --> 00:28:33.000
 he's doing those through a reading process.

00:28:33.000 --> 00:28:34.800
 - These days, there's not enough nuance on Twitter

00:28:34.800 --> 00:28:35.800
 for people to get that.

00:28:35.800 --> 00:28:37.280
 I don't think he'd be able to have done it today.

00:28:37.280 --> 00:28:39.080
 - So there's a foremost satirist of your time

00:28:39.080 --> 00:28:41.160
 and it's just to be considered an age lord,

00:28:41.160 --> 00:28:42.880
 but he actually is a brutal guy.

00:28:42.880 --> 00:28:44.480
 It's nuanced, for heaven's sake.

00:28:44.480 --> 00:28:46.240
 (laughing)

00:28:46.240 --> 00:28:48.280
 - One of you try, we're doing down the people.

00:28:48.280 --> 00:28:49.960
 I want one of you to tweet something

00:28:49.960 --> 00:28:53.080
 about a group of people eating babies today

00:28:53.080 --> 00:28:54.320
 and see what happens to you.

00:28:54.320 --> 00:28:56.240
 - I'm not on Twitter.

00:28:56.240 --> 00:28:57.400
 So, one of you two will--

00:28:57.400 --> 00:28:59.040
 - On Twitter, we'll go down and storm these days.

00:28:59.040 --> 00:29:01.280
 I can show you that in a group of news.

00:29:01.280 --> 00:29:02.880
 - I could put it in a WhatsApp group.

00:29:02.880 --> 00:29:05.120
 (laughing)

00:29:05.120 --> 00:29:06.200
 - Just see.

00:29:06.200 --> 00:29:07.040
 - Yeah.

00:29:07.040 --> 00:29:08.520
 - Yeah, the Christmas one's gone quite.

00:29:08.520 --> 00:29:10.560
 (laughing)

00:29:10.560 --> 00:29:11.800
 - Just out of the blue.

00:29:11.800 --> 00:29:13.400
 - Oh, what's Mars up to?

00:29:13.400 --> 00:29:15.280
 - Oh, what are we thinking this year?

00:29:15.280 --> 00:29:18.200
 - Another pseudonym, John Barron.

00:29:18.200 --> 00:29:19.440
 Do you know this one?

00:29:19.440 --> 00:29:20.440
 - No, Barron.

00:29:20.440 --> 00:29:21.960
 - How do you know the name Barron?

00:29:21.960 --> 00:29:22.960
 - Barron. - Barron.

00:29:22.960 --> 00:29:24.800
 - Or Barron, like, Barron.

00:29:24.800 --> 00:29:26.600
 - B-A-D-L-R-O-N.

00:29:26.600 --> 00:29:27.440
 - The Barron Knights.

00:29:27.440 --> 00:29:28.920
 - She's a famous Barron these days.

00:29:28.920 --> 00:29:29.760
 - Barron Trump.

00:29:29.760 --> 00:29:30.600
 - Yes.

00:29:30.600 --> 00:29:32.960
 So, Donald Trump pseudonym, John Barron.

00:29:32.960 --> 00:29:37.720
 So, when Forbes were doing the richest people list,

00:29:37.720 --> 00:29:39.120
 John Barron wrote to them saying,

00:29:39.120 --> 00:29:40.440
 "Oh, you've got to put Trump in here."

00:29:40.440 --> 00:29:41.680
 He's a billionaire.

00:29:41.680 --> 00:29:42.520
 - No.

00:29:42.520 --> 00:29:43.880
 - Yeah, and he's got a few others.

00:29:43.880 --> 00:29:46.120
 There's a guy called John Miller,

00:29:46.120 --> 00:29:48.160
 who once wrote to People Magazine,

00:29:48.160 --> 00:29:51.520
 who'd said something about Trump saying actually,

00:29:51.520 --> 00:29:53.760
 Trump is a very compassionate husband.

00:29:53.760 --> 00:29:56.800
 And lots of beautiful women are always asking to go out with him.

00:29:56.800 --> 00:29:59.000
 In fact, Madonna called and wanted to go out with him.

00:29:59.000 --> 00:30:00.520
 That I could tell you.

00:30:00.520 --> 00:30:02.400
 - But what makes you think that's one of his pseudonyms?

00:30:02.400 --> 00:30:04.440
 - We, it came out in court later.

00:30:04.440 --> 00:30:06.840
 - Oh, that's amazing, that's it.

00:30:06.840 --> 00:30:09.420
 (upbeat music)

00:30:09.420 --> 00:30:13.520
 - Okay, that's it.

00:30:13.520 --> 00:30:15.480
 That is all of our outtakes.

00:30:15.480 --> 00:30:17.560
 If you have anything to say about them,

00:30:17.560 --> 00:30:20.520
 if you want to share any extra juicy bits of detail

00:30:20.520 --> 00:30:21.440
 that you know about them,

00:30:21.440 --> 00:30:25.280
 you can message us on podcast@qy.com.

00:30:25.280 --> 00:30:27.080
 Those emails go through to Andy,

00:30:27.080 --> 00:30:29.760
 and a lot of those emails then get taken over

00:30:29.760 --> 00:30:31.640
 to drop us a line where we discuss them.

00:30:31.640 --> 00:30:34.760
 So send us your favorite facts, send us an anecdote,

00:30:34.760 --> 00:30:37.400
 send us anything that you think is worth sharing,

00:30:37.400 --> 00:30:40.640
 and hopefully you can make it onto a drop us a line.

00:30:40.640 --> 00:30:42.880
 Just a reminder, no such thing as a fish.com.

00:30:42.880 --> 00:30:46.080
 You got the ticket link for all of our upcoming gigs,

00:30:46.080 --> 00:30:48.680

00:30:51.560 --> 00:30:54.240
 and that is the fifth and sixth of September.

00:30:54.240 --> 00:30:56.440
 So get your tickets now, and that's it.

00:30:56.440 --> 00:30:58.480

 We'll see you then.

00:31:01.120 --> 00:31:02.280
 Goodbye.

00:31:02.280 --> 00:31:04.860
 (upbeat music)

00:31:04.860 --> 00:31:07.440
 (upbeat music)

00:31:07.440 --> 00:31:08.600
 (upbeat music)
