00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,840
 Hello and welcome to No Such Thing as a Fish, a weekly podcast coming to you from the QI

3
00:00:15,840 --> 00:00:21,120
 offices in Hoban. My name is Andrew Hunter Murray, I'm joined by James Harkin, Dan Treiber

4
00:00:21,120 --> 00:00:28,560
 and Anna Tadzinski, and this is an upside-down Christmasy end of year-y episode, Lord of

5
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:38,160
 Mistrule style. I'm in charge. The lunatics have taken over the asylum. Exactly that, and instead of

6
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:45,440
 us telling you our facts, you are going to be telling us your facts. No, we will be telling

7
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:51,280
 you your facts. That's it. We will be telling each other your facts, but you are allowed to listen.

8
00:00:53,760 --> 00:01:00,240
 You're welcome. Basically, we have the email address, podcast@QI.com, people write in with all

9
00:01:00,240 --> 00:01:04,000
 sorts of stuff, and if you remember Clubfish, you'll hear every month the kind of things people

10
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:08,240
 write in with them, one of our bonus episodes, but also you send in a huge number of brilliant

11
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:13,440
 extra facts. So we have just gathered around here, we have a massive pile of different facts from

12
00:01:13,440 --> 00:01:17,120
 all of you, some of the absolute best ones that have been sent in over the last year or two.

13
00:01:17,120 --> 00:01:20,400
 You know, because we can all dip into the inbox, we might have seen a couple of them,

14
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:24,480
 a lot of them we'll have never seen before. Yeah, so would someone like to begin?

15
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:28,800
 I got the facts here. Yeah, go on. All right, this is from Haley Dargan. It says,

16
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:34,720
 "A team in Darwin, Australia, drove a car named Mudcrab, seven kilometers underwater across the

17
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:40,160
 harbour. They got bogged down nearly a dozen times and dealt with the threat of crocodiles.

18
00:01:40,160 --> 00:01:44,720
 In doing this, they broke two world records, longest underwater drive and the deepest

19
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:50,080
 underwater drive." Wow. Pretty cool. I didn't, sorry, it's a cut wall kind of car?

20
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:55,200
 It's called the Mudcrab and it's, I guess, amphibious and... Drive sideways. Yep.

21
00:01:55,200 --> 00:02:02,560
 That's cool that it can drive underwater. Very much don't try this with your own car,

22
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:08,080
 warning, right? Yeah, this is, I bet there's a few alterations they've made to their regular car.

23
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:14,400
 There's an old, I think it's a Mitch Hedberg joke. There's something like that,

24
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:20,160
 which I will absolutely butcher, but it's something like, "I went on a date with a girl.

25
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:25,200
 It didn't go very well. She was annoyed that I didn't open the doors for her and rather I swam

26
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:35,200
 straight to the surface." That's a very good joke. That story reminds me of that story we had in

27
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:39,440
 one of our books of the year, our books we did about the news of the year. If you want to catch

28
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:44,880
 up on the news of 2018, why don't you go to Amazon and buy it? But one of the stories was about

29
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:50,080
 those two Australian women, I think this is right, who were following their sat-nav and just,

30
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:53,520
 it was somewhere in Australia and they just followed their sat-nav into the ocean.

31
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:58,240
 Just because the sat-nav had messed up and they just went, "Must be right, must be right."

32
00:02:58,240 --> 00:03:02,880
 It's amazing. And their car got stranded in the sea. Do you remember, we mentioned on the podcast,

33
00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:07,200
 there was a president who had an amphibious car and he used to take, so it wasn't at the White House.

34
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:11,360
 It was Johnson. It was Johnson, that's right. And he would take his friends out in the car

35
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:14,640
 and they would go a bit down a hill where there was a lake at the bottom and then he would fake

36
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:18,400
 losing control. "Oh God, oh God, what is that?" And then they would go in the lake, but they'd

37
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:25,200
 obviously drive on. Very, very cool. If there's ever a weird wacky thing a president did fact,

38
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:29,360
 it's always LBJ, isn't it? It's amazing how time to lose the war in Vietnam.

39
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:34,720
 You lose the war in Vietnam, yeah, is where I was going. It's amazing. In the last decade or so,

40
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:42,160
 we've had such straight down the line presidents happily buttoned up, you know. In the Addo National

41
00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:47,680
 Park in South Africa, if you're driving along there, dung beetles have the right of way.

42
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:52,080
 So if you're driving along and a dung beetle crosses the road, you have to just sit there

43
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:56,160
 and wait for it. "How good is everyone's eyesight in this area? Sorry, that's incredible."

44
00:03:56,160 --> 00:04:00,880
 They are small, but they do push large bowls of dung. "That's a good point. Yeah, fair enough."

45
00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:04,000
 And there must be a lot of traffic jams with a lot of cars stopping. Is that,

46
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:07,040
 "Can you get out of the car and check?" No, just a normal beetle, okay, get back in.

47
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:14,400
 Or a normal poo, yeah. Just a poo in the middle. I'm sure I can't see the beetle, but it must be

48
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:18,800
 there. Pretty sure it's not moving. That would be breakups. You would hear breakups there. It was

49
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:23,600
 like, "Why'd they leave you? Why'd your boyfriend leave you?" He waited five hours, five hours,

50
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:28,640
 because there was a random piece of poo sitting on the road. If you do go driving in any of these

51
00:04:28,640 --> 00:04:34,240
 places like I drove in Yellowstone, I think in a few other places like that, you do have a lot

52
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:40,000
 of traffic jams, because as soon as there's an animal there, everyone stops and you just kind

53
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:44,640
 of sat there at the back. And the first two or three people can all see the animal, but of course,

54
00:04:44,640 --> 00:04:48,800
 then it wanders off and they drive off and everyone else who's in the traffic jam never gets to see it.

55
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:53,280
 And the elves. The elves of Iceland we've spoken about before. Oh yeah. Well, they believe a lot

56
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:57,040
 of people in Iceland believe there are elves and they believe they live in rocks. And so if a rock

57
00:04:57,040 --> 00:05:01,840
 finds its way into the middle of the road and it's a believed home of an elf, you can't move the

58
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:05,840
 rock, you have to drive around literally maybe going off-road in order to get around it until

59
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:09,840
 it's removed safely by the proper authority. Anyway, look guys, I'm sorry, we're moving on to the next

60
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:16,400
 fact. Oh, this is actually a bit of an audience feedback one. It's from Dave Clemer. We mentioned

61
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:23,040
 the Treaty of Versailles and the rights to champagne or naming champagne. Oh yeah. So Dave said,

62
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:26,480
 "I didn't know about that, but it was not shocking given the presence of two other items I knew about

63
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:30,880
 with the extreme military significance in the Treaty of Versailles. One of them was the patent

64
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:37,040
 on aspirin, which Bayer, the German pharmaceutical firm, was required to give up. The second is the

65
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:43,440
 concert pitch for orchestras being standardised such that the A above middle C is 435 Hertz.

66
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:48,240
 That was in the Treaty of Versailles. I think this is on QI this year, isn't it?

67
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:52,720
 Amazing. That's incredible. It might be on your TV in about 18 months' time.

68
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:58,320
 But yeah, the British used to tune their instruments to a different...

69
00:05:58,320 --> 00:06:00,880
 Actually, everyone came to the British way, did they? I can't remember.

70
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:02,480
 I can't remember. Because they won the First World War.

71
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:05,040
 I can't remember. It was so good. That was what really upset the Germans.

72
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:08,560
 This is actually the platform on which Hitler built his rise to power, was that?

73
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:14,480
 Frequency things. 30 years of Hertz was the slogan he wrote, wasn't it? Thank you.

74
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:20,800
 Just a quick fact about that. So if you play, I can play the trumpet, for instance, and when you

75
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:26,240
 tune to the orchestra, you play a B-flat because everyone plays whatever their

76
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:31,440
 notes is tuned to, and then it all comes together, and you can hear if you're slightly flat or

77
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:35,680
 slightly sharp. But B-flat is also the way you tune a Vuvuzela.

78
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:43,360
 How many orchestras? I think there is one Vuvuzela concerto that someone wrote once.

79
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:48,080
 That's incredible. That's so good. That's the sad thing, isn't it?

80
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:53,360
 So few professional Vuvuzelists get a chance. I wonder when, last time,

81
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:56,560
 officially, an instrument's been allowed into the main orchestra posse.

82
00:06:56,560 --> 00:07:00,160
 It's interesting. That's a good point. One of the sort of later,

83
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:03,840
 weird brass instruments, you know? Like, weirder than a French horn.

84
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:09,200
 You'll see a theremin often. But that's not part of a classical orchestra.

85
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:11,440
 Yeah, that's quite neat. That's a great point.

86
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:16,320
 I remember seeing, I watched a piece once. I can't remember who it was by, shame on me,

87
00:07:16,320 --> 00:07:20,480
 but there was a part for cutlery. Lovely.

88
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:24,880
 So the percussionist had a load of cutlery there and they would either rattle it,

89
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:28,560
 or they would drop it, or whatever. Was it a tuning fork? Brilliant.

90
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:30,400
 There we go. There we go. If you're on fire today.

91
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:32,560
 That's another one. Come on.

92
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:37,120
 All right, here we go. This is from Tom Whitfield.

93
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:43,840
 "The world record for highest jump into water is held by Rick Charles at 172 feet."

94
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:49,600
 Can I ask, was that how high the water was, or how high he was before he got in the water?

95
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:53,120
 How would highest jump into water?

96
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:56,800
 I just thought it might be someone like, for instance, I've been to Lake Titicaca,

97
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:59,600
 which is the highest navigational lake in the world.

98
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:00,160
 Right.

99
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:02,000
 If I jumped into Lake Titicaca, I'd like to...

100
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:02,960
 You've broken this record.

101
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:05,840
 I can see what he was saying. Sorry.

102
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:07,920
 It's just a fun bit of whimsy from James, though.

103
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:11,440
 No, I love a fun bit of whimsy. You know me. I get comedy.

104
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:14,080
 I just sometimes like it to be expanded on a little bit.

105
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:17,200
 So, sorry, that's 20 feet higher than the Statue of Liberty.

106
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:21,120
 An air had to be pumped into the pool to break the surface tension.

107
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:23,120
 Otherwise, he would have gone splat.

108
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:24,240
 That's amazing.

109
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:27,280
 I think it's in the '70s or so, because there's footage of it.

110
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:30,000
 So, I follow the YouTube link that Tom put in the email.

111
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,960
 It's unbelievable, because he's basically on a ladder,

112
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:34,400
 which is taller than the Statue of Liberty.

113
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:36,720
 You just see so far up.

114
00:08:36,720 --> 00:08:38,000
 That's hard to get up the ladder.

115
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,600
 I was impressed that he got up the ladder at all.

116
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:40,560
 I mean, it's stunning.

117
00:08:40,560 --> 00:08:43,680
 We're on the second floor of this building, and I struggled most weeks.

118
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:48,160
 What's interesting is someone very, very recently,

119
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:51,840
 and I've heard the term "the highest jump into a body of water ever,"

120
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:54,240
 broke the record just a few days ago.

121
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:56,960
 So, maybe this is an old email, and possibly it was right at the time.

122
00:08:56,960 --> 00:08:59,200
 And he doesn't have water.

123
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:00,560
 It's incredible. You see the footage.

124
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:03,200
 He's standing on the edge of a cliff, and he throws something.

125
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:03,920
 I don't know what it was.

126
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:06,000
 It looks like a giant fish, but I don't think it is.

127
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,560
 Into the water, and as soon as it hits and breaks this tension,

128
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:11,360
 he jumps and goes in, and it's the new world record.

129
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:12,400
 Oh, really?

130
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:14,400
 Okay, well, it must be my turn to read the facts.

131
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:15,840
 I'll take the one closest to me.

132
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:20,080
 This is from Sam Kavayaro.

133
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:23,760
 And Sam says, "I was reading an article about the early human species

134
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:26,000
 that coexisted with Homo sapiens,

135
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:29,200
 and they mentioned the estimates of how many Neanderthals were alive

136
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:31,600
 at any one time, giving an upper limit,

137
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:35,360
 and my brain immediately decided to find a relatable reference scale

138
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:38,960
 and came up with a nearby city that had similar population."

139
00:09:38,960 --> 00:09:40,560
 So, I thought you might not have a sense

140
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:43,200
 of what the population of Olympia, Washington is.

141
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:43,520
 Correct.

142
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:46,400
 Absolutely zero reference for that.

143
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:48,560
 I think that's the capital of Washington, isn't it, Olympia?

144
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:50,160
 I don't even know whether that's true or not.

145
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:51,120
 I simply have not...

146
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:53,040
 I had not heard of Olympia, Washington before now.

147
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:54,320
 It's not the biggest.

148
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:55,280
 It's not Seattle.

149
00:09:55,280 --> 00:09:58,560
 So, I looked up a UK comparison.

150
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:00,880
 "At the estimated most populous,

151
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:04,720
 there were as many Neanderthals as modern humans living in Torquay."

152
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:09,840
 That would be an excellent episode of Faulty Towers.

153
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:11,200
 That's great.

154
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:12,320
 Wait, how many was it?

155
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:13,040
 52,000.

156
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:14,160
 52,000, yeah.

157
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:15,920
 That is unbelievable.

158
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:16,720
 Yeah, that's...

159
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:17,280
 Wow.

160
00:10:17,280 --> 00:10:19,520
 Actually, that would be a cool premise for something.

161
00:10:19,520 --> 00:10:20,640
 Like, the Neanderthals are here.

162
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:22,960
 They all live in Torquay, and it's about the...

163
00:10:22,960 --> 00:10:24,160
 Modern-day Torquay.

164
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:24,800
 Yeah, yeah.

165
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:28,000
 And it's just like the amusing cultural clashes that you get.

166
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:32,640
 Do they remove all of the current population of Torquay

167
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:34,880
 so the population stays at 52,000,

168
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:37,760
 or does the population balloon to 104,000?

169
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:41,440
 I think everyone in Torquay is sort of bought out of their homes,

170
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:43,840
 and it's like, we need to house exactly this number of people,

171
00:10:43,840 --> 00:10:45,200
 so where can we put them up?

172
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:46,400
 You all go to Exeter.

173
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:48,320
 Exactly that.

174
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:49,040
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

175
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:49,600
 Wow.

176
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:50,080
 Yeah.

177
00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:53,200
 So, yeah, there were also 1,000 more Neanderthals in the world

178
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:56,480
 at their peak than there are currently inhabitants

179
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:57,680
 of the county of Rutland.

180
00:10:57,680 --> 00:10:59,680
 Very nice.

181
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:02,480
 So, I mean, I reckon that I have more knowledge

182
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:04,640
 about the city of Olympia in Washington

183
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:06,560
 than I do about the county of Rutland.

184
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:08,160
 I've had my notes the smallest county.

185
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:09,200
 I live very near it,

186
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:12,240
 and I can tell you the difference between the people there

187
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:12,960
 and Neanderthals.

188
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:13,760
 Right.

189
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:15,120
 Oh, there we go.

190
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:15,600
 Ouch.

191
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:16,640
 That's a good slagic.

192
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:19,760
 Rutland used to be a proper county,

193
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:22,080
 and I believe it's now a unitary authority.

194
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:23,360
 So, much like the Neanderthal,

195
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:25,600
 it's actually sort of faded into the past.

196
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:25,920
 Wow.

197
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:26,240
 Really?

198
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:27,040
 The county of Rutland, yes.

199
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:28,480
 I thought it was still a county.

200
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:30,400
 Actually, interesting, the people of Rutland

201
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:34,560
 do bury their dead with flowers and trinkets,

202
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:38,560
 and a rumoured to have mastered fire.

203
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:39,440
 Wow.

204
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:41,200
 And actually, if you get yourself tested,

205
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:42,000
 you are often,

206
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,320
 you are between one and three percent Rutland.

207
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:49,200
 But I've got another one here from David Saunders.

208
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:52,160
 The British basketball league is having to change its name

209
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:54,000
 as no one can Google it,

210
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,160
 because the acronym is shared with a surgical procedure

211
00:11:56,160 --> 00:11:57,840
 that's become very popular in recent years.

212
00:11:57,840 --> 00:11:59,840
 Our Brazilian butt lift.

213
00:11:59,840 --> 00:12:03,360
 That's brilliant.

214
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:05,600
 The league's new logo looks more like it's advertising

215
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:07,360
 the surgery than the basketball.

216
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:08,480
 It's true.

217
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:09,920
 I've seen the new logo and it's a big,

218
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:11,200
 it's a big Bulbas B.

219
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:11,920
 I'll put it that way.

220
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:13,280
 It does.

221
00:12:13,280 --> 00:12:15,040
 It looks a bit like in Bambus.

222
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:16,240
 How interesting.

223
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:16,800
 It's been lifted.

224
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:18,880
 That's cool.

225
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:20,960
 Do you think having a big Brazilian butt

226
00:12:20,960 --> 00:12:22,480
 would help you in the basketball?

227
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:23,200
 Unquestionably.

228
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:23,600
 I don't know.

229
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:24,240
 Of course.

230
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:25,280
 If you've got me there, yeah.

231
00:12:25,280 --> 00:12:27,520
 You're space-hoppering your way along the court on that thing?

232
00:12:27,520 --> 00:12:28,080
 Yeah.

233
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:30,560
 You don't bounce on your arse in basketball.

234
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:32,240
 I think that's a travel violation, yeah.

235
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:37,520
 But do you think like if Kobe Bryant

236
00:12:37,520 --> 00:12:39,680
 was jumping and doing a basket,

237
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:41,040
 he might say to someone,

238
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:42,400
 "Can you smell my arse?"

239
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:44,400
 That was a thing, right?

240
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:46,000
 That was a, yeah, yeah.

241
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,520
 Just tell me how my arse tastes.

242
00:12:47,520 --> 00:12:53,680
 Grandad cried.

243
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:59,840
 Because you're up your bum to the other guy's face, right?

244
00:12:59,840 --> 00:13:01,520
 I was thinking, yeah.

245
00:13:01,520 --> 00:13:02,160
 What was the story?

246
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:04,000
 It was like Shaquille O'Neal and Ed.

247
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:04,960
 Yeah, okay, be right.

248
00:13:04,960 --> 00:13:07,280
 That's like, I just had such a flashback

249
00:13:07,280 --> 00:13:08,080
 to when I was a kid.

250
00:13:08,080 --> 00:13:09,520
 You know, when you used to get so embarrassed,

251
00:13:09,520 --> 00:13:11,440
 your mum's singing along the really wrong words

252
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:12,400
 to modern songs.

253
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:15,520
 And I just felt that shiver hearing you say that.

254
00:13:15,520 --> 00:13:16,240
 You know what?

255
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:18,400
 It was in the same episode that we mentioned that

256
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:20,560
 as the darts, players,

257
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:22,800
 where one of them farted and put the other one up.

258
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:23,280
 Oh, yeah.

259
00:13:23,280 --> 00:13:24,640
 So that's why I'm conflating.

260
00:13:24,640 --> 00:13:25,200
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

261
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:25,840
 See?

262
00:13:25,840 --> 00:13:27,680
 I think that's a good, I think that's...

263
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:29,520
 Don't listen to these guys, James.

264
00:13:29,520 --> 00:13:32,000
 I think that's a really good, like,

265
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,320
 punk line for you in whatever sport you are.

266
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:36,640
 Okay, smell my arse.

267
00:13:36,640 --> 00:13:37,200
 That's my arse.

268
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:40,080
 When I'm playing Scrabble over Christmas,

269
00:13:40,080 --> 00:13:43,120
 I got to say it to my hitmoss.

270
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:45,120
 He has smelled my arse.

271
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:49,280
 Oh, my God.

272
00:13:49,280 --> 00:13:49,920
 Brilliant.

273
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:56,480
 Here's one.

274
00:13:56,480 --> 00:13:58,240
 Ludwig Umeyer.

275
00:13:58,240 --> 00:13:59,840
 In Cuban and other cigar factories,

276
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:02,000
 it used to be common to have a person to read aloud

277
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,000
 to the cigar rollers while they worked.

278
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:04,640
 Oh, yes.

279
00:14:04,640 --> 00:14:06,640
 And the Monte Cristo cigar brand got its name

280
00:14:06,640 --> 00:14:08,080
 because the Count of Monte Cristo

281
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:09,280
 was an extremely popular choice

282
00:14:09,280 --> 00:14:10,800
 for the workers to listen to.

283
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:11,200
 That's incredible.

284
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:12,080
 That's interesting.

285
00:14:12,080 --> 00:14:13,680
 I heard the story one, I think.

286
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:14,000
 Yeah.

287
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,760
 I think we told that on the show at one point.

288
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:16,240
 Oh, did we?

289
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:16,960
 Sorry, okay.

290
00:14:16,960 --> 00:14:18,320
 Yeah, but that's a great extra detail.

291
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:20,240
 Yeah, that's the bit that I think is amazing,

292
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:21,440
 really, the Monte Cristo bit.

293
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:22,320
 It's such a long bit.

294
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:22,800
 It is long, yeah.

295
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:24,880
 You could watch Sony Cigar as well listening to that.

296
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:26,400
 It's long but quite exciting.

297
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:29,680
 And also, it's not very, I would say...

298
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:31,440
 You don't really need to remember what happened at the start,

299
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:33,120
 so you could, like, swoop in and swoop out a bit,

300
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:34,960
 because it's just him and his adventures, isn't it?

301
00:14:34,960 --> 00:14:36,160
 It almost feels like the second half

302
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:36,960
 is a bit like a comic book.

303
00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:38,960
 There's, like, a 300-page digression in Paris

304
00:14:38,960 --> 00:14:39,760
 in the middle bit.

305
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:40,960
 Yeah, I know, but that's...

306
00:14:40,960 --> 00:14:42,240
 But you don't need to know what's happened before.

307
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:43,280
 It's just, like, there's this rich dude

308
00:14:43,280 --> 00:14:44,880
 having a bloody whale of a time.

309
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:45,680
 Yeah.

310
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:49,760
 On Cuba, Fidel Castro once ate 18 bowls of ice cream

311
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:50,720
 in a single sitting.

312
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:52,240
 Okay.

313
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:53,280
 Yeah, he just liked ice cream.

314
00:14:53,280 --> 00:14:55,040
 As like, oh, that wasn't a challenge.

315
00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:55,760
 It wasn't a challenge.

316
00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:56,880
 He really liked ice cream.

317
00:14:56,880 --> 00:14:58,720
 There was a big thing in Cuba,

318
00:14:58,720 --> 00:14:59,840
 which we might have mentioned before,

319
00:14:59,840 --> 00:15:01,360
 about milk and stuff like that,

320
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:04,960
 and being able to feed the country with amazing cows

321
00:15:04,960 --> 00:15:05,840
 and stuff like that.

322
00:15:05,840 --> 00:15:08,880
 So it was partly an advertising thing

323
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:10,000
 about how great our milk is,

324
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,320
 but it was also partly he just loved ice cream.

325
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:12,880
 Right.

326
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:13,520
 His sister died this year.

327
00:15:13,520 --> 00:15:14,480
 His sister passed away.

328
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:15,040
 Yeah.

329
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:15,440
 Really?

330
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:15,840
 Yeah.

331
00:15:15,840 --> 00:15:18,000
 She was a double agent, basically.

332
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,080
 She, to begin with, loved Castro,

333
00:15:20,080 --> 00:15:22,320
 and then when he took over,

334
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:24,400
 and then he continued to sort of go in a direction

335
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:25,600
 that was bad, she went,

336
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:26,880
 hang on a second, I thought you were going to be good

337
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:28,240
 when you got into power, and he wasn't.

338
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:29,600
 And so she left Cuba.

339
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:30,800
 I can't remember where she went.

340
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:32,320
 And, yeah, he became a spy,

341
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:34,960
 and was really a big part in his downfall.

342
00:15:34,960 --> 00:15:35,920
 Sorry he didn't have a downfall.

343
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:36,560
 He...

344
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:37,360
 Sorry, sorry.

345
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:38,080
 Sorry, sorry.

346
00:15:38,080 --> 00:15:40,080
 He basically outlasted 10 U.S. presidents.

347
00:15:40,080 --> 00:15:40,880
 Sorry.

348
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:44,000
 Like, she was the worst spy ever.

349
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:47,520
 I guess that's where the double agent bit comes in.

350
00:15:47,520 --> 00:15:49,200
 She's actually doing a four keeper.

351
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:51,920
 Yeah, I'll make sure I bring him down.

352
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:53,360
 Next week, honestly, he's coming down.

353
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:57,120
 One of the first facts I remember discovering for QI

354
00:15:57,120 --> 00:15:59,760
 was in a cigar magazine about Kennedy

355
00:15:59,760 --> 00:16:01,360
 when he placed the embargo on Cuba.

356
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:04,080
 His last move before that was to order

357
00:16:04,080 --> 00:16:06,320
 a couple of suitcases of Cuban cigars, wasn't it?

358
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:07,920
 Well, he would have them sent over to him,

359
00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:10,000
 and then the gates came down.

360
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,880
 I love though that they would discover that fact in Cuba

361
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:15,840
 while someone's reading out a biography of JFK

362
00:16:15,840 --> 00:16:17,440
 as part of the Rolex system.

363
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:17,760
 Yes.

364
00:16:17,760 --> 00:16:18,400
 He did what?

365
00:16:18,400 --> 00:16:20,160
 The factory workers.

366
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:22,240
 Shall I take another?

367
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:22,640
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

368
00:16:22,640 --> 00:16:23,440
 Back to from the middle.

369
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:25,200
 Okay, again, this is the closest to me.

370
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:26,720
 So, Rebecca from Ottawa.

371
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:30,160
 I think not the band, probably the province.

372
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:32,080
 We'll find out, I guess.

373
00:16:32,080 --> 00:16:35,120
 What did Ottawa sing?

374
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:35,680
 Final Count?

375
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:36,640
 No, not the Final Count.

376
00:16:36,640 --> 00:16:38,480
 That's something really famous, they say.

377
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:39,360
 Sorry, I don't know.

378
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:41,440
 Final Countdown was when they called Europe.

379
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:42,800
 Yeah, Ottawa.

380
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:45,440
 Ottawa, not Ottawa.

381
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:47,040
 They did D-I-S-C-O.

382
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:48,640
 Oh, that's a big story.

383
00:16:48,640 --> 00:16:49,920
 D-I-S-C-O.

384
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:51,440
 But unfortunately, slightly different names.

385
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:52,800
 So, Brenda's that whole bit.

386
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:57,440
 So, Rebecca, who is a person who lives in Ottawa,

387
00:16:57,440 --> 00:16:58,640
 an Ottawa, you might say.

388
00:16:58,640 --> 00:17:01,840
 Right, say that.

389
00:17:01,840 --> 00:17:03,040
 Do you think there's a shop in Ottawa?

390
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:05,200
 Ottawa and Ottomans.

391
00:17:05,200 --> 00:17:06,400
 Like a furniture shop.

392
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:06,720
 Yeah.

393
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:07,680
 There should be, shouldn't there?

394
00:17:07,680 --> 00:17:08,560
 There should be, yeah.

395
00:17:08,560 --> 00:17:11,760
 Ottawa, Rebecca, writes,

396
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:15,120
 "Thought you might enjoy this new story from Canada

397
00:17:15,120 --> 00:17:16,160
 about a sad goat."

398
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:18,960
 She goes on to put the headline,

399
00:17:18,960 --> 00:17:22,320
 which is "Mysterious Screams on BC Island,"

400
00:17:22,320 --> 00:17:24,080
 British Columbia, I imagine.

401
00:17:24,080 --> 00:17:26,560
 "Turn out to be from a sad goat,

402
00:17:26,560 --> 00:17:28,560
 Royal Canadian Mounted Police say."

403
00:17:28,560 --> 00:17:32,560
 And yeah, there was basically a lot of sounds

404
00:17:32,560 --> 00:17:36,160
 in the bottom of a ravine in British Columbia,

405
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:38,000
 in Quadra Island.

406
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:41,120
 And the Mounties say it didn't come from a person in distress,

407
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:42,800
 but rather a sad goat.

408
00:17:42,800 --> 00:17:44,400
 It sounded apparently a bit like,

409
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:45,600
 "Help! Help!"

410
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:49,040
 Oh, that was great.

411
00:17:49,040 --> 00:17:50,960
 Do we know why the goat was so sad?

412
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:51,200
 Yes.

413
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:54,720
 We, the momma goat's babies had been removed

414
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:56,000
 and she was calling for them.

415
00:17:56,080 --> 00:17:56,640
 Oh.

416
00:17:56,640 --> 00:17:57,280
 Been removed.

417
00:17:57,280 --> 00:17:57,920
 That is sad.

418
00:17:57,920 --> 00:17:59,600
 That has taken a sad turn.

419
00:17:59,600 --> 00:17:59,760
 Yeah.

420
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:01,920
 I'm now, yeah, I'm now siding with her on the dinner.

421
00:18:01,920 --> 00:18:04,080
 Could have been just removed temporarily

422
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:05,120
 to go to nursery.

423
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:06,720
 Yes.

424
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:08,160
 Do you think, do you think that's what it was?

425
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:11,040
 It's hard to sell.

426
00:18:11,040 --> 00:18:14,800
 Thankfully, officers confirmed all was well

427
00:18:14,800 --> 00:18:16,720
 and nobody, besides the momma goats,

428
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:18,080
 was in any kind of distress.

429
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:19,680
 Huh.

430
00:18:19,680 --> 00:18:21,040
 Poor old, poor old momma goat.

431
00:18:21,040 --> 00:18:22,240
 Don't know how much we did enjoy that.

432
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:24,240
 Should be looking around at everyone's faces.

433
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:25,120
 Yeah.

434
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:27,680
 It is de-distressing.

435
00:18:27,680 --> 00:18:28,400
 It was I...

436
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:30,800
 Okay, never mind.

437
00:18:30,800 --> 00:18:32,080
 It was nice idea for a joke.

438
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:36,480
 I got one here, which is from Ivor Cardus.

439
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:39,440
 And it's from chapter five of A Very British Murder

440
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:40,560
 by Lucy Walsley.

441
00:18:40,560 --> 00:18:43,040
 And so this is an extract, I think word for word.

442
00:18:43,040 --> 00:18:44,320
 "During the First World War,

443
00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:47,440
 trainee soldiers were frequently set the initiative test

444
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:48,640
 of hiding and spending the night

445
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:50,800
 in Madame Tussaud's Chamber of Horrors.

446
00:18:50,800 --> 00:18:52,000
 This caused such inconvenience

447
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,840
 that Madame Tussauds was forced officially

448
00:18:53,840 --> 00:18:55,840
 to ask the War Office to stop the practice."

449
00:18:55,840 --> 00:19:00,480
 How many soldiers would fit in Madame Tussaud's Chamber of Horrors

450
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:02,400
 before it became unmanageably...

451
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:02,720
 Yeah.

452
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:04,560
 Like, poor it's just a military training ground at that point.

453
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:05,600
 What is the Chamber of Horrors?

454
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:06,960
 Is it one room? Is it a whole building?

455
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:10,000
 No, it's a sort of labyrinthine basement

456
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,000
 full of, you know, spooky people...

457
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,520
 It's relatively small, though.

458
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:14,400
 It's tight, isn't it?

459
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:15,040
 The corridors.

460
00:19:15,040 --> 00:19:16,160
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

461
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:18,160
 People jump out at you, people grab you.

462
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:20,240
 Yeah, I actually really don't like those

463
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:22,480
 when actors are jumping out at you.

464
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:24,640
 I get why people do, but I just find them really teased.

465
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:26,080
 But you love horror films.

466
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:26,720
 Yeah.

467
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:28,480
 But it's like a live horror film, isn't it?

468
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:30,800
 It's not really, it's just people trying to scare you.

469
00:19:30,800 --> 00:19:34,160
 That actually, now you say it, that is quite like a horror film.

470
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:38,800
 I don't like it because I find both of them equally scary, you know?

471
00:19:38,800 --> 00:19:40,880
 I don't like ghost rides, all things like that,

472
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:43,200
 because I have such high hopes and they're always disappointed

473
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:44,480
 because they're never scary enough.

474
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:47,040
 Except the ghost ride at Alton Towers.

475
00:19:47,040 --> 00:19:48,640
 I'm absolutely terrified in all of them.

476
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:51,040
 I'm shouting to the people behind me in the ghost train.

477
00:19:51,040 --> 00:19:52,400
 Can you smell my ass?

478
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:53,440
 You know, I'm really.

479
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:59,840
 In the after World War One,

480
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:02,000
 K-World War Two,

481
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:06,080
 in World War Two, would Kitchener have been a...

482
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:07,200
 No, not Kitchener.

483
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:07,920
 Who was it?

484
00:20:07,920 --> 00:20:08,640
 An American.

485
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:09,440
 Who's an American?

486
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:11,040
 General?

487
00:20:11,040 --> 00:20:11,440
 General.

488
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:12,000
 Patrick?

489
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:12,720
 Eisenhower?

490
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:14,160
 I can't remember who it was.

491
00:20:14,160 --> 00:20:15,200
 Might have begun with K.

492
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:18,320
 Anyway, an American goes back to France

493
00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:22,400
 and he sees that there's a war grave

494
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:25,280
 that the locals have been looking after for years and years and years.

495
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:29,440
 And what he doesn't have the guts to tell them

496
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:30,960
 is actually they'd mistaken it.

497
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:33,040
 It wasn't a war grave, it was a toilet.

498
00:20:33,040 --> 00:20:37,200
 And they'd had this kind of like latrine,

499
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:39,200
 which all the soldiers had used.

500
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:41,840
 And they'd put something on there to kind of say,

501
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:43,040
 "This is the latrine."

502
00:20:43,040 --> 00:20:44,960
 And the locals, when they came back,

503
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:46,320
 saw it and thought it was a grave.

504
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:46,800
 No.

505
00:20:46,800 --> 00:20:49,360
 And for 25 years, they were putting flowers down.

506
00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:50,400
 Oh, England.

507
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:51,120
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

508
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:53,840
 But like, did they put a headstone down to mark the latrine?

509
00:20:53,840 --> 00:20:56,320
 Because that would be a weird thing to do for one thing.

510
00:20:56,320 --> 00:20:57,040
 It wasn't that.

511
00:20:57,040 --> 00:21:00,080
 It was more like, you know, you put a stick with some flowers.

512
00:21:00,080 --> 00:21:01,920
 So the people would know that it was a latrine.

513
00:21:01,920 --> 00:21:02,720
 Oh, no.

514
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:04,880
 And it was in, whoever it was,

515
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:07,920
 it was in his memoirs that he went back there 25 years later,

516
00:21:07,920 --> 00:21:08,800
 and this is what they would do.

517
00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:10,400
 Why did he go back to the toilet?

518
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:16,240
 I want to have one final poo to remind me of the good old days.

519
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:18,560
 Back to the area where he was stationed.

520
00:21:18,560 --> 00:21:22,320
 What's awful is that if you squatted and took a poo there,

521
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:24,560
 you'd probably be arrested for desecration.

522
00:21:24,560 --> 00:21:24,960
 Yes.

523
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:25,760
 Such a holy mo-

524
00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:27,680
 And yet, you're the only one doing the right thing.

525
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:28,160
 Yes.

526
00:21:28,160 --> 00:21:30,480
 We shout as they dragged you away in chains.

527
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:31,280
 Yeah.

528
00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:31,920
 That's a great story.

529
00:21:31,920 --> 00:21:32,160
 Oh, yeah.

530
00:21:32,160 --> 00:21:32,880
 Hannah, you go.

531
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:35,120
 Here's one from Matilda H.

532
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:39,360
 In 2018, Ikea released an advert designed to be urinated on.

533
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:41,280
 I think we might have said this.

534
00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:42,080
 Yes, I remember this.

535
00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:42,800
 We did do this.

536
00:21:42,800 --> 00:21:44,400
 It was a pregnancy test.

537
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:45,760
 It was.

538
00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:46,480
 Yes.

539
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:48,400
 And it got you a discount on...

540
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:50,560
 Your baby.

541
00:21:50,560 --> 00:21:53,120
 Give you a free baby.

542
00:21:53,120 --> 00:21:54,880
 You got a crib discount on the crib.

543
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:56,080
 Yes, it's baby furniture.

544
00:21:56,080 --> 00:21:58,640
 But I mean, not how much furniture baby needs to be on the crib,

545
00:21:58,640 --> 00:21:58,960
 does it?

546
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:00,480
 They don't need a writing desk or a...

547
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:03,680
 A baby shays long.

548
00:22:03,680 --> 00:22:05,360
 Shays short, yeah.

549
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:10,080
 Yeah, it said a positive pregnancy reading

550
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:12,480
 would get you a discount of 50%.

551
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:13,600
 And according to the agency,

552
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:15,440
 getting the technological aspect of the ad

553
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:16,720
 took some work.

554
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:19,120
 However, they quote in the email,

555
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:22,000
 "The pregnancy test strip was used as a starting point."

556
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:22,640
 Makes sense.

557
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:25,040
 "Which relies on antibodies that bind to the pregnancy hormone,

558
00:22:25,040 --> 00:22:26,960
 HTG, resulting in the color change."

559
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:30,000
 And did you have to take along the now quite urinary magazine

560
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:30,800
 or whatever it was?

561
00:22:30,800 --> 00:22:32,080
 Yeah, I don't know.

562
00:22:32,080 --> 00:22:34,080
 Were they waterproof posters that they put up?

563
00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:35,120
 I guess you did.

564
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:36,000
 But it's not a poster.

565
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,560
 You can't have people going around peeing on the posters.

566
00:22:38,560 --> 00:22:39,680
 Just as releasing an advert.

567
00:22:39,680 --> 00:22:40,160
 Don't know what form came in.

568
00:22:40,160 --> 00:22:41,680
 Yeah, doesn't say capable of the TV.

569
00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:47,120
 People are trying to get a pissy tally.

570
00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:51,280
 So many people were electrocuted by this campaign.

571
00:22:51,280 --> 00:22:52,160
 They had to end it.

572
00:22:52,160 --> 00:22:52,800
 Oh, that's great.

573
00:22:52,800 --> 00:22:53,440
 That's a great fact.

574
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:54,000
 Here's a good one.

575
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:55,440
 I guess this is from Hailey Inslee.

576
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:57,920
 Mass produced tomatoes in cans.

577
00:22:57,920 --> 00:22:59,600
 We're all familiar with those.

578
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:02,640
 Oh, their existence to Galapagos tortoises.

579
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:04,640
 Is it a riddle me this?

580
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:06,080
 Yeah, that is a riddle me this, isn't it?

581
00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:06,640
 What is it?

582
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:07,760
 Would you like to have a riddle?

583
00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:09,200
 Is there any chance we can get it?

584
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:09,520
 No.

585
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:13,440
 So, famously on the beagle,

586
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:17,200
 all the giant tortoises that were brought back were eaten as food, right?

587
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:19,600
 So, you've got a giant turtle that's been eaten,

588
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:22,320
 but you've not got the turtle, but you've got the shell.

589
00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:26,160
 Is it possible that any of the fruit and veg that was on the boat

590
00:23:26,160 --> 00:23:29,840
 was then stored inside the empty shells?

591
00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:29,840
 Really?

592
00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:32,480
 And it kind of kept them fresh enough that they thought,

593
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:33,440
 oh, we should be storing it.

594
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:34,000
 That is really good.

595
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:34,720
 That's really good.

596
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:35,600
 That's very plausible.

597
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:37,920
 Can I have another guess, assuming that that's not right?

598
00:23:37,920 --> 00:23:37,920
 Yeah.

599
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:42,080
 Tomatoes you get in a tin are a very special species

600
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:43,360
 that are not the normal tomatoes you get,

601
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:45,280
 because they work better in tins.

602
00:23:45,280 --> 00:23:50,400
 And these species of tomatoes where the seeds went through a turtle

603
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:53,200
 and in the turtle's poo and grew out of turtle poo.

604
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:53,760
 Very good.

605
00:23:53,760 --> 00:23:55,680
 Do you know James is actually closest here?

606
00:23:55,680 --> 00:23:56,000
 Oh, wow.

607
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:58,080
 I'm going to give James the point, because that's...

608
00:23:58,080 --> 00:23:59,360
 So, okay, I'll tell you what it is.

609
00:23:59,360 --> 00:24:00,560
 It's sort of a bit like that.

610
00:24:00,560 --> 00:24:02,560
 Okay, when you pick a...

611
00:24:02,560 --> 00:24:04,400
 Oh, and you should all have been saying tortoises throughout.

612
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:07,440
 Sorry, I'll take another point.

613
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:11,280
 When you pick a tomato, that short section of stem that comes with it,

614
00:24:11,280 --> 00:24:14,880
 you know, that little spidery bit, is the callix.

615
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:17,120
 And there's a tiny bit of stem breaking off from a joint

616
00:24:17,120 --> 00:24:18,480
 which is called the pedicel, right?

617
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:20,800
 So for many years, these sharp stubs meant you couldn't put them

618
00:24:20,800 --> 00:24:22,800
 into automatic harvesting bins,

619
00:24:22,800 --> 00:24:25,280
 because you'd end up with sharp stubs in the can, right?

620
00:24:25,280 --> 00:24:29,600
 But an American botanist called Charles Rick, two first names,

621
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:32,960
 discovered a tomato plant with jointless pedicels,

622
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:35,200
 but he couldn't get them to germinate.

623
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:39,120
 The only solution he found as a last ditch was to feed the seeds to some tortoises.

624
00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:41,120
 The seeds then germinated quickly.

625
00:24:41,120 --> 00:24:42,080
 He bred from them.

626
00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:42,960
 Within a couple of years,

627
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:45,520
 all mass-produced tinted tomatoes could be machine harvested.

628
00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:46,560
 - Wow! - So I think...

629
00:24:46,560 --> 00:24:49,680
 - James is amazing. - But also, Charles Rick,

630
00:24:49,680 --> 00:24:51,440
 what amazing lateral thinking going...

631
00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:54,800
 The only way I can do this is to feed it through an animal.

632
00:24:54,800 --> 00:24:57,120
 He must have tried various different things,

633
00:24:57,120 --> 00:24:58,960
 even different animals before then, I would think.

634
00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:00,320
 Yeah, that's incredible.

635
00:25:00,320 --> 00:25:01,280
 No, you're right.

636
00:25:01,280 --> 00:25:03,520
 I got one here from Jeff Houghton.

637
00:25:03,520 --> 00:25:06,080
 Check out a guy by the name of Francis Wharton,

638
00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:09,040
 a backwards man, I think, British Columbia, who in the...

639
00:25:09,040 --> 00:25:09,680
 A backwards...

640
00:25:09,680 --> 00:25:11,840
 Backwards, rather than backwards, right?

641
00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:13,600
 From the backwards, not...

642
00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:14,720
 He's a backwards man.

643
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:15,520
 Yeah.

644
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:18,720
 British Columbia, who in the 1960s shot a deer,

645
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:21,600
 used its teeth to make his own dentures,

646
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:24,880
 then used them to eat the deer with its own teeth.

647
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:26,960
 - Wow! - Blimey.

648
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:28,880
 That's incredible, if true.

649
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:29,600
 I've got a question.

650
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:30,000
 Yeah.

651
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:31,840
 Do deer have canine teeth?

652
00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:33,040
 You wouldn't have thought so, would you?

653
00:25:33,040 --> 00:25:34,640
 I would have thought they're mostly molar-based

654
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:35,840
 for all the plants they eat.

655
00:25:35,840 --> 00:25:38,080
 - Yeah. - You wouldn't want to eat sort of live prey.

656
00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:39,520
 But you can sharpen, right?

657
00:25:39,520 --> 00:25:41,040
 Presumably, that's what he was doing.

658
00:25:41,040 --> 00:25:42,400
 He probably shaved them to size.

659
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:42,800
 Yeah.

660
00:25:42,800 --> 00:25:45,120
 Which animal's teeth would you most like to have in your mouth?

661
00:25:45,120 --> 00:25:45,840
 What a great question.

662
00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:49,360
 Well, what about the sheep's head fish

663
00:25:49,360 --> 00:25:50,240
 that we mentioned the other day,

664
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:52,640
 which has the teeth of human teeth?

665
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:53,760
 I wouldn't want those.

666
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:54,320
 I would want...

667
00:25:54,320 --> 00:25:54,960
 Okay, wow.

668
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:57,120
 I mean, shark's teeth, where they grow on a conveyor belt.

669
00:25:57,120 --> 00:25:58,320
 Sorry, just on Anna's point.

670
00:25:58,320 --> 00:25:59,680
 I guess the question is,

671
00:25:59,680 --> 00:26:02,480
 are you doing it to improve yourself,

672
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:05,360
 or has some evil demon come to you saying,

673
00:26:05,360 --> 00:26:07,280
 "You must have another animal's teeth,"

674
00:26:07,280 --> 00:26:10,160
 in which case, Anna's idea is quite clever,

675
00:26:10,160 --> 00:26:10,560
 because you're like,

676
00:26:10,560 --> 00:26:12,960
 "Well, basically, I'm just getting human teeth back."

677
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:14,080
 You're tricking the demon, though.

678
00:26:14,080 --> 00:26:14,320
 Yeah.

679
00:26:14,320 --> 00:26:15,200
 I think the demon will say,

680
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:17,040
 "And it can't be the sheep's head fish."

681
00:26:17,040 --> 00:26:18,880
 It's a nice try.

682
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:19,360
 Yeah.

683
00:26:19,360 --> 00:26:20,640
 That wasn't in the contract.

684
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:22,560
 I want...

685
00:26:22,560 --> 00:26:25,280
 You know how blue whales have that sort of...

686
00:26:25,280 --> 00:26:26,000
 Baleen.

687
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:26,400
 Yeah.

688
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:26,880
 No, no.

689
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:28,160
 There's huge plates of...

690
00:26:28,160 --> 00:26:29,360
 Where you...

691
00:26:29,360 --> 00:26:30,080
 Baleen.

692
00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:30,720
 Baleen.

693
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:31,520
 Yeah.

694
00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:33,680
 The system whereby that you can only get krill through.

695
00:26:33,680 --> 00:26:34,720
 Yeah, because it's called baleen.

696
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:35,040
 Yeah.

697
00:26:35,040 --> 00:26:35,600
 There we go.

698
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:35,920
 I don't...

699
00:26:35,920 --> 00:26:37,600
 I don't baleen.

700
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:38,160
 Oh!

701
00:26:38,160 --> 00:26:38,880
 What's that?

702
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:40,480
 It's what blue whales have.

703
00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:42,240
 That's a nice idea.

704
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:42,400
 Yeah.

705
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:44,160
 So then every meal, every dinner party I go to,

706
00:26:44,160 --> 00:26:46,240
 it's like, "Oh, the guy who can only eat krills coming."

707
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:46,560
 We've got to...

708
00:26:46,560 --> 00:26:50,000
 Kate, hundreds of thousands of krill food.

709
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:52,720
 Got one vegetarian, one vegan, and the krill guys,

710
00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:54,240
 and there's nothing that'll please all of them.

711
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:57,920
 Guys, Dan, I've just realized,

712
00:26:57,920 --> 00:26:59,360
 I don't think you have any canines.

713
00:26:59,360 --> 00:27:00,400
 Oh.

714
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:01,120
 Really?

715
00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:02,240
 Holy moly.

716
00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:02,640
 Look at that.

717
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:03,360
 Holy moly.

718
00:27:03,360 --> 00:27:07,600
 So normally you've got two in the middle,

719
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:09,520
 two on the sides, then two canines, right?

720
00:27:09,520 --> 00:27:11,440
 Where are your third teeth out?

721
00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:12,640
 They're completely flat.

722
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:13,840
 Dan, whoa.

723
00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:16,000
 You're the newly evolved human,

724
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:17,520
 because we don't need our canines anymore,

725
00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:18,720
 because we have cutlery.

726
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:19,520
 So well done.

727
00:27:19,520 --> 00:27:21,840
 Hang on, I find it really hard to bite things these days.

728
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:23,760
 Yeah, you can see Anna's canine's right there.

729
00:27:23,760 --> 00:27:25,760
 No, honestly, this is incredible.

730
00:27:25,760 --> 00:27:27,920
 So, you know, when you go to the pub and you buy a pack of crisps,

731
00:27:27,920 --> 00:27:30,160
 and often you want to open it up so that everyone can eat it,

732
00:27:30,160 --> 00:27:31,280
 you might bite into it.

733
00:27:31,280 --> 00:27:32,400
 For years I could do that,

734
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:34,880
 and then suddenly, five years ago, I can't bite.

735
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:35,120
 I can't get through.

736
00:27:35,120 --> 00:27:36,880
 Someone's come and shaved your teeth in the night.

737
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:38,160
 Holy moly.

738
00:27:38,160 --> 00:27:40,160
 Well, there you go.

739
00:27:40,160 --> 00:27:41,840
 We've learned an interesting fact today,

740
00:27:41,840 --> 00:27:46,560
 and here's another one from Jeff Partica,

741
00:27:46,560 --> 00:27:48,800
 who opens with an admission.

742
00:27:48,800 --> 00:27:51,280
 He says, "I may have a fact-sharing problem.

743
00:27:51,280 --> 00:27:52,400
 Thanks for letting us know,

744
00:27:52,400 --> 00:27:54,720
 but I'd be remiss if I didn't share at least one.

745
00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:56,160
 I myself do not hunt,

746
00:27:56,160 --> 00:27:58,480
 with this fact being one good reason.

747
00:27:58,480 --> 00:27:59,520
 In any given year,

748
00:27:59,520 --> 00:28:02,400
 Michigan, Wisconsin, Minnesota, and Pennsylvania

749
00:28:02,400 --> 00:28:06,160
 combine to issue over 2.5 million deer hunting licenses,

750
00:28:06,160 --> 00:28:07,760
 which, if an organized group,

751
00:28:07,760 --> 00:28:10,480
 would be the largest standing army in the world."

752
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:13,840
 Knowing some hunters, though,

753
00:28:13,840 --> 00:28:17,360
 generally speaking, organized would not be the word I do for them.

754
00:28:17,360 --> 00:28:21,840
 Isn't that the idea of Americans being able to bear arms?

755
00:28:21,840 --> 00:28:22,480
 Certainly is.

756
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:24,240
 In case the government goes rogue,

757
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:26,960
 there is automatically a standing army there.

758
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:27,280
 Right.

759
00:28:27,280 --> 00:28:28,880
 I think that's one of the arguments.

760
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:29,840
 Yeah, yeah.

761
00:28:29,840 --> 00:28:32,720
 Or in case the deer finally get their act together

762
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:34,000
 and rub out on mass.

763
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:34,560
 Yeah, yeah.

764
00:28:34,560 --> 00:28:35,920
 Claim back their teeth.

765
00:28:35,920 --> 00:28:36,800
 I haven't done one for a while.

766
00:28:36,800 --> 00:28:37,280
 Yeah, go for it.

767
00:28:37,280 --> 00:28:37,280
 Go for it.

768
00:28:37,280 --> 00:28:37,920
 Can I read this?

769
00:28:37,920 --> 00:28:41,600
 This is from Noa de Koening from the Netherlands.

770
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:44,320
 "Today I found out that the timer on your washing machine

771
00:28:44,320 --> 00:28:47,200
 doesn't just feel wrong, it often is.

772
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:50,640
 The timer on your washing machine is an estimation

773
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:52,640
 based on the weight of your laundry

774
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:55,120
 or, inverted commas, load sense,

775
00:28:55,120 --> 00:28:57,680
 and it adjusts itself as it goes."

776
00:28:57,680 --> 00:28:58,640
 That's incredible.

777
00:28:58,640 --> 00:28:59,760
 Oh, my God.

778
00:28:59,760 --> 00:29:00,720
 Is it Noa?

779
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:01,040
 Yeah, no.

780
00:29:01,040 --> 00:29:04,240
 Noa, you've saved the world for the second time today,

781
00:29:04,240 --> 00:29:06,240
 because that is...

782
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:08,320
 My mind is blown.

783
00:29:08,320 --> 00:29:10,320
 I've wandered this for years, haven't we all?

784
00:29:10,320 --> 00:29:12,000
 Because how often have we looked

785
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:14,000
 at the last minutes of the washing machine,

786
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:15,040
 especially when you're desperate,

787
00:29:15,040 --> 00:29:15,920
 it's just before you go to bed

788
00:29:15,920 --> 00:29:17,280
 and you're desperate to take it out?

789
00:29:17,280 --> 00:29:19,200
 And apparently, because I did see this one,

790
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:19,920
 I looked into it,

791
00:29:19,920 --> 00:29:22,720
 the last minutes are specifically the ones

792
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:24,480
 where the timing messes up quite a lot.

793
00:29:24,480 --> 00:29:26,160
 Is it because there's less water,

794
00:29:26,160 --> 00:29:27,680
 so they're less heavy, maybe?

795
00:29:27,680 --> 00:29:30,080
 It's because the cycle...

796
00:29:30,080 --> 00:29:31,680
 What's happening in the cycle in the last minutes

797
00:29:31,680 --> 00:29:33,040
 is they're spinning it around,

798
00:29:33,040 --> 00:29:34,560
 so it's to do with water.

799
00:29:34,560 --> 00:29:37,040
 It's trying to shed the excess water.

800
00:29:37,040 --> 00:29:39,200
 So, depending on the density of your wash,

801
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:41,120
 the water can be much greater

802
00:29:41,120 --> 00:29:43,200
 than the washing machine has estimated at the end.

803
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:44,960
 So, yes, it'll spin for longer and longer,

804
00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:46,480
 and that's why they're agonizing.

805
00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:47,520
 When you go in eight minutes,

806
00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:48,480
 you go in eight minutes later,

807
00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:49,760
 it's seven minutes, whatever,

808
00:29:49,760 --> 00:29:50,800
 it's really annoying.

809
00:29:50,800 --> 00:29:51,520
 That's a great fact.

810
00:29:51,520 --> 00:29:52,080
 Thank you, Noa.

811
00:29:52,080 --> 00:29:52,960
 Incredible.

812
00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:54,560
 Can we just say, Dan has lined up

813
00:29:54,560 --> 00:29:55,840
 loads of facts before him.

814
00:29:55,840 --> 00:29:56,800
 Like, he's sort of doing

815
00:29:56,800 --> 00:29:58,320
 monopoly money collection over here.

816
00:29:58,320 --> 00:29:59,840
 No, they just happen to be facing me.

817
00:29:59,840 --> 00:30:00,640
 Oh, interesting.

818
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:02,000
 I mean, arguably,

819
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:03,440
 see all those bits of paper in front of you.

820
00:30:03,440 --> 00:30:04,400
 We can all throw stones.

821
00:30:04,400 --> 00:30:06,640
 Can I read out a fact?

822
00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:07,680
 What? That was just about to...

823
00:30:07,680 --> 00:30:08,880
 I've got 20 lines up to it.

824
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:09,600
 Oh, you've got loads.

825
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:10,160
 You've done loads.

826
00:30:10,160 --> 00:30:10,720
 You've done loads.

827
00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:11,200
 Like, here's one.

828
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:12,480
 Here's one from Dominic Brown.

829
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:12,800
 Oh, I don't know.

830
00:30:12,800 --> 00:30:14,400
 He's a pretty intense host this time.

831
00:30:14,400 --> 00:30:15,440
 Yeah.

832
00:30:15,440 --> 00:30:17,120
 It's about time someone started cracking the whip.

833
00:30:17,120 --> 00:30:18,240
 No, I love this.

834
00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:19,680
 This is from Dominic Brown.

835
00:30:19,680 --> 00:30:21,920
 The US Navy has an army

836
00:30:21,920 --> 00:30:23,120
 which has an air force.

837
00:30:23,120 --> 00:30:26,400
 That's great.

838
00:30:26,400 --> 00:30:26,960
 I was looking this up

839
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:28,080
 to try and find out a bit more about it.

840
00:30:28,080 --> 00:30:29,840
 It turns out that the US Army

841
00:30:29,840 --> 00:30:30,960
 also has its own Navy.

842
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:34,880
 They've got...

843
00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:35,360
 I can't remember.

844
00:30:35,360 --> 00:30:36,800
 It's called Army Watercraft Systems,

845
00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:39,280
 and they have got 130 boats or ships

846
00:30:39,280 --> 00:30:40,800
 or vessels or whatever it is.

847
00:30:40,800 --> 00:30:41,360
 Right.

848
00:30:41,360 --> 00:30:42,960
 It must be quite confusing.

849
00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:43,520
 Yeah.

850
00:30:43,520 --> 00:30:45,440
 I go in here, Chelsea Pyle.

851
00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:46,080
 My husband told me this.

852
00:30:46,080 --> 00:30:47,360
 Sounds like a very expensive house.

853
00:30:47,360 --> 00:30:51,200
 My husband told me this interesting fact,

854
00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:52,640
 and I found an article to explain it.

855
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:56,080
 When Mount St. Helens erupted in 1980,

856
00:30:56,080 --> 00:30:57,280
 the sound of the explosion

857
00:30:57,280 --> 00:30:59,760
 could be heard as far away as Canada.

858
00:30:59,760 --> 00:31:00,960
 So we kind of all know that, right?

859
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:02,000
 Like it sort of went...

860
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:02,800
 Where's Mount St. Helens?

861
00:31:02,800 --> 00:31:03,920
 Quite near Canada, right?

862
00:31:03,920 --> 00:31:04,160
 Is it?

863
00:31:04,160 --> 00:31:05,440
 Yeah.

864
00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:06,640
 I mean, it is, isn't it?

865
00:31:06,640 --> 00:31:07,040
 What?

866
00:31:07,040 --> 00:31:08,640
 It's in the Northwest of America.

867
00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:09,360
 Oh, the USA?

868
00:31:09,360 --> 00:31:09,680
 Yeah.

869
00:31:09,680 --> 00:31:10,160
 Oh, okay.

870
00:31:10,160 --> 00:31:10,960
 Okay.

871
00:31:10,960 --> 00:31:12,160
 It's in Washington.

872
00:31:12,160 --> 00:31:12,480
 Okay.

873
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:13,120
 But still...

874
00:31:13,120 --> 00:31:14,000
 Oh, that's next door.

875
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:15,200
 There's still a distance, though, right?

876
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:16,320
 The point of the next sentence...

877
00:31:16,320 --> 00:31:17,360
 Several hundred miles away

878
00:31:17,360 --> 00:31:18,800
 that you can hear this eruption.

879
00:31:18,800 --> 00:31:19,120
 Yeah, right.

880
00:31:19,120 --> 00:31:19,760
 There you go.

881
00:31:19,760 --> 00:31:20,800
 The sound of the explosion

882
00:31:20,800 --> 00:31:22,960
 could be heard as far away as Canada.

883
00:31:22,960 --> 00:31:25,200
 But to those closest to the epicenter,

884
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:26,400
 it made no sound at all.

885
00:31:26,400 --> 00:31:27,920
 Oh, I see.

886
00:31:27,920 --> 00:31:28,160
 What?

887
00:31:28,160 --> 00:31:28,560
 Yeah.

888
00:31:28,560 --> 00:31:29,120
 What?

889
00:31:29,120 --> 00:31:30,000
 That's pretty amazing.

890
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:30,720
 Is this like a trick

891
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:32,320
 because they were underwater or something?

892
00:31:32,320 --> 00:31:34,080
 How is that possible?

893
00:31:34,080 --> 00:31:35,840
 They were in a mudcrab vehicle,

894
00:31:35,840 --> 00:31:37,840
 setting a world record.

895
00:31:37,840 --> 00:31:38,720
 Is that...

896
00:31:38,720 --> 00:31:40,000
 How?

897
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:42,000
 Is it like being in the eye of a storm?

898
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:42,960
 I guess so, right?

899
00:31:42,960 --> 00:31:43,280
 Yeah.

900
00:31:43,280 --> 00:31:43,920
 Oh.

901
00:31:43,920 --> 00:31:44,480
 It can't be currently.

902
00:31:44,480 --> 00:31:44,880
 No, no, sorry.

903
00:31:44,880 --> 00:31:45,840
 I was just saying yes.

904
00:31:45,840 --> 00:31:47,440
 Is it like that?

905
00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:49,280
 I wasn't saying yes, it is.

906
00:31:49,600 --> 00:31:54,320
 It is weird because sound...

907
00:31:54,320 --> 00:31:57,280
 I don't feel like sound acts like the eye of a storm,

908
00:31:57,280 --> 00:31:59,040
 I guess, which is where it's whirling around you.

909
00:31:59,040 --> 00:32:00,320
 It's not like James talks,

910
00:32:00,320 --> 00:32:01,440
 and if I'm standing right in front of him,

911
00:32:01,440 --> 00:32:03,280
 I can't hear it, but if I step to the side...

912
00:32:03,280 --> 00:32:06,240
 And now James is miming at me for the distance at home.

913
00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:07,520
 That's a really good visual, Ken.

914
00:32:07,520 --> 00:32:08,160
 Yeah.

915
00:32:08,160 --> 00:32:08,800
 That was great.

916
00:32:08,800 --> 00:32:12,480
 If sound gets too loud,

917
00:32:12,480 --> 00:32:15,360
 it creates a shockwave rather than a sound wave.

918
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:16,160
 Oh, yeah.

919
00:32:16,160 --> 00:32:17,760
 Oh, is that so?

920
00:32:17,760 --> 00:32:18,560
 Maybe it's that.

921
00:32:18,560 --> 00:32:18,960
 That's very good.

922
00:32:18,960 --> 00:32:20,080
 Do you not have the reason?

923
00:32:20,080 --> 00:32:22,240
 No, I mean, I'm clicking the link here with my finger

924
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:24,480
 on this bit of paper, but it's not open.

925
00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:25,680
 Sorry, that's my fluff.

926
00:32:25,680 --> 00:32:26,240
 I should have...

927
00:32:26,240 --> 00:32:28,240
 Oh, dear.

928
00:32:28,240 --> 00:32:29,440
 Someone else read it.

929
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:31,920
 This is from Hannah Killen or Kylan?

930
00:32:31,920 --> 00:32:32,640
 Kylan, I think.

931
00:32:32,640 --> 00:32:33,280
 Kylan, okay.

932
00:32:33,280 --> 00:32:35,120
 This is from Hannah Kylan.

933
00:32:35,120 --> 00:32:37,600
 During the World Wars, spies, mainly women,

934
00:32:37,600 --> 00:32:40,960
 were discovered because what would have given them away?

935
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:42,480
 So they trained in language,

936
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:44,960
 they trained in culture and manner.

937
00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:46,480
 What would have given them away?

938
00:32:46,480 --> 00:32:50,080
 Specifically, something specifically female that...

939
00:32:50,080 --> 00:32:52,160
 You know what, I thought it was going to be at first?

940
00:32:52,160 --> 00:32:54,400
 There was a woman who was arrested

941
00:32:54,400 --> 00:32:57,760
 because they had some weird writing on their buttocks.

942
00:32:57,760 --> 00:33:00,320
 And what had happened was they'd sat on a train

943
00:33:00,320 --> 00:33:02,000
 and they were worried about the dirty seats.

944
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:04,720
 So I'd put some newspaper underneath their bum

945
00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:07,680
 and then the print had gone onto their bum cheeks

946
00:33:07,680 --> 00:33:09,360
 and it had been like backwards writing.

947
00:33:09,360 --> 00:33:10,560
 So they didn't really know what it said.

948
00:33:10,560 --> 00:33:12,480
 So they assumed that she'd been dispatched into the country

949
00:33:12,480 --> 00:33:14,960
 with a secret message for the resistance.

950
00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:16,400
 Exactly. Written on her bum.

951
00:33:16,400 --> 00:33:18,320
 And it just said, "Could you smell my ass?"

952
00:33:18,320 --> 00:33:23,680
 Was it they ordered pints instead?

953
00:33:23,680 --> 00:33:26,000
 And in Germany, you don't order pints.

954
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:28,400
 No, I guess like famous examples are

955
00:33:28,400 --> 00:33:30,560
 a spy once was outed when she was giving birth

956
00:33:30,560 --> 00:33:33,040
 and she started swearing in her actual name

957
00:33:33,040 --> 00:33:34,400
 after that kind of stuff.

958
00:33:34,400 --> 00:33:35,760
 No, we talked about the spies,

959
00:33:35,760 --> 00:33:37,280
 the German spies who were caught in the UK

960
00:33:37,280 --> 00:33:39,280
 because didn't they have a lot of...

961
00:33:39,280 --> 00:33:40,960
 Was it sausages in their bag or something?

962
00:33:40,960 --> 00:33:44,080
 And there were French spies who were given away

963
00:33:44,080 --> 00:33:46,000
 because they smelled of garlic or something.

964
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:46,720
 Do you remember that?

965
00:33:46,720 --> 00:33:47,920
 No, it's too crude.

966
00:33:47,920 --> 00:33:49,680
 Yeah, there was an Australian spy

967
00:33:49,680 --> 00:33:51,040
 who was throwing a boomerang.

968
00:33:51,040 --> 00:33:54,000
 There was a Mexican spy with a big sombrero.

969
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:55,920
 It's so cute. There was one amazing story

970
00:33:55,920 --> 00:33:57,120
 where a guy was...

971
00:33:57,120 --> 00:33:59,120
 They thought he was a spy and they just couldn't get him.

972
00:33:59,120 --> 00:34:00,560
 They kept trying, they're interrogating,

973
00:34:00,560 --> 00:34:02,080
 doing all the tricks to get him to do.

974
00:34:02,080 --> 00:34:03,280
 And he was just flawless.

975
00:34:03,280 --> 00:34:05,760
 And then supposedly one day when crossing a road,

976
00:34:05,760 --> 00:34:07,840
 one of the people who was trying to out him

977
00:34:07,840 --> 00:34:10,000
 was behind him and went, "Watch out a car!"

978
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:11,200
 And he looked the wrong way.

979
00:34:11,200 --> 00:34:11,760
 Brilliant.

980
00:34:11,760 --> 00:34:14,480
 And but like, you need a lot of witnesses.

981
00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:16,400
 Like, how does that hold up in court?

982
00:34:16,400 --> 00:34:16,880
 Yeah.

983
00:34:16,880 --> 00:34:18,000
 Everything else is...

984
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:21,760
 Anyway, the answer here is that they knitted wrong.

985
00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:23,680
 So this is from a book by Debbie Stoller

986
00:34:23,680 --> 00:34:24,960
 called Stitch and Bitch.

987
00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:27,280
 And the idea is that Americans knit

988
00:34:27,280 --> 00:34:29,840
 in a very cumbersome, time-consuming way.

989
00:34:29,840 --> 00:34:31,120
 These are Hannah's words.

990
00:34:31,120 --> 00:34:32,080
 It feels like, yes.

991
00:34:32,080 --> 00:34:36,240
 Where they let go of the yarn

992
00:34:36,240 --> 00:34:37,600
 and then loop it around the needle.

993
00:34:37,600 --> 00:34:40,160
 Whereas Europeans never let go of the yarn

994
00:34:40,160 --> 00:34:41,920
 and can make the stitches much faster.

995
00:34:41,920 --> 00:34:44,240
 So they would be outed for their knitting style.

996
00:34:44,240 --> 00:34:44,480
 Wow.

997
00:34:44,480 --> 00:34:47,520
 So this is American spies in France,

998
00:34:47,520 --> 00:34:48,480
 presumably, or in Germany or whatever.

999
00:34:48,480 --> 00:34:50,240
 Yeah, it's going to be interesting.

1000
00:34:50,240 --> 00:34:50,880
 Great fact.

1001
00:34:50,880 --> 00:34:50,960
 Yeah.

1002
00:34:50,960 --> 00:34:53,120
 Because in knitting, people used to knit codes

1003
00:34:53,120 --> 00:34:54,480
 in various wars, didn't they?

1004
00:34:54,480 --> 00:34:56,640
 Like, morse code into knitting.

1005
00:34:56,640 --> 00:34:59,200
 You'd have specific lumps in your knitwear.

1006
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:00,240
 I don't know how much it was done

1007
00:35:00,240 --> 00:35:02,560
 and how much there was a lot of fear mongering around.

1008
00:35:02,560 --> 00:35:03,200
 Oh my God.

1009
00:35:03,200 --> 00:35:05,040
 Is that person wearing a jumper

1010
00:35:05,040 --> 00:35:07,600
 actually transmitting morse code to their friend?

1011
00:35:07,600 --> 00:35:09,600
 But you could definitely knit code into stuff.

1012
00:35:09,600 --> 00:35:11,280
 Remember that, also, that where they used to show you

1013
00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:12,560
 people's heads and tattoo them?

1014
00:35:12,560 --> 00:35:13,040
 Yes.

1015
00:35:13,040 --> 00:35:14,320
 And then this is back in like--

1016
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:14,640
 I think--

1017
00:35:14,640 --> 00:35:16,560
 This is a revolution, so it broke me at times.

1018
00:35:16,560 --> 00:35:17,040
 Yeah.

1019
00:35:17,040 --> 00:35:18,240
 And the hair would grow back.

1020
00:35:18,240 --> 00:35:18,720
 Exactly.

1021
00:35:18,720 --> 00:35:19,680
 There's a problem with that.

1022
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:22,240
 And with the pregnancy one.

1023
00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:22,560
 Yeah.

1024
00:35:22,560 --> 00:35:24,240
 Is you have to wait quite a long time

1025
00:35:24,240 --> 00:35:26,880
 between setting it up and getting the pay off.

1026
00:35:26,880 --> 00:35:29,040
 The message will be out of date by the time.

1027
00:35:29,040 --> 00:35:29,840
 You would think so.

1028
00:35:29,840 --> 00:35:30,560
 You would think so.

1029
00:35:30,560 --> 00:35:31,680
 Wait, what was pregnancy one?

1030
00:35:31,680 --> 00:35:33,040
 Well, like, for instance, the idea

1031
00:35:33,040 --> 00:35:36,080
 that Dan mentioned, which was when a woman gives birth,

1032
00:35:36,080 --> 00:35:37,600
 she'll swear in her own language.

1033
00:35:37,600 --> 00:35:38,480
 Sorry, yes.

1034
00:35:38,480 --> 00:35:40,720
 If you weren't sure someone was an agent

1035
00:35:40,720 --> 00:35:42,400
 and you had to wait for them to get pregnant

1036
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:44,000
 and then wait nine months and then--

1037
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:44,160
 Yes.

1038
00:35:44,160 --> 00:35:44,720
 Yeah.

1039
00:35:44,720 --> 00:35:45,360
 Yeah.

1040
00:35:45,360 --> 00:35:48,000
 And how are you going to impregnate them as well?

1041
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:48,560
 They're what it's not going to be.

1042
00:35:48,560 --> 00:35:49,520
 Probably the normal way.

1043
00:35:49,520 --> 00:35:54,880
 She got pregnant in a peculiarly British way.

1044
00:35:54,880 --> 00:36:04,160
 All right.

1045
00:36:04,160 --> 00:36:06,880
 This is from Jeremy Correken.

1046
00:36:06,880 --> 00:36:10,320
 And he says, "My hometown, Rochester, New York,

1047
00:36:10,320 --> 00:36:13,440
 forgot it had a nuclear reactor.

1048
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:16,800
 And it found out when they were about to tear it down."

1049
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:17,280
 And--

1050
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:19,360
 The wrecking ball has just swung back.

1051
00:36:19,360 --> 00:36:23,280
 I've just thought of something.

1052
00:36:23,280 --> 00:36:24,720
 And there's more detail on this.

1053
00:36:24,720 --> 00:36:26,080
 And it's amazing, actually.

1054
00:36:26,080 --> 00:36:26,960
 I'll just read it to you.

1055
00:36:26,960 --> 00:36:29,600
 So Kodak may be a sinking ship.

1056
00:36:29,600 --> 00:36:30,800
 Kodak the company.

1057
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:31,120
 Oh, yeah.

1058
00:36:31,120 --> 00:36:33,440
 A humorously written piece here.

1059
00:36:33,440 --> 00:36:35,840
 But apparently it's a nuclear sinking ship

1060
00:36:35,840 --> 00:36:36,880
 for more than 30 years.

1061
00:36:36,880 --> 00:36:39,920
 The company kept a small reactor running in its basement

1062
00:36:39,920 --> 00:36:40,960
 in Rochester.

1063
00:36:40,960 --> 00:36:44,160
 And it was used for research and powered by 3.5 pounds

1064
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:45,040
 of uranium.

1065
00:36:45,040 --> 00:36:46,400
 Kodak the--

1066
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:47,360
 I think the camera--

1067
00:36:47,360 --> 00:36:48,160
 The camera people.

1068
00:36:48,160 --> 00:36:49,120
 The camera people.

1069
00:36:49,120 --> 00:36:50,160
 Had their own nuclear.

1070
00:36:50,160 --> 00:36:51,680
 Believe so.

1071
00:36:51,680 --> 00:36:52,400
 That's amazing.

1072
00:36:52,400 --> 00:36:54,400
 And it's the kind they make bombs from.

1073
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:56,000
 Apparently--

1074
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:56,880
 Wow.

1075
00:36:56,880 --> 00:36:57,920
 They took precautions.

1076
00:36:57,920 --> 00:37:00,320
 The reactor was locked away in a concrete bunker.

1077
00:37:00,320 --> 00:37:01,360
 It never leaks.

1078
00:37:01,360 --> 00:37:03,520
 And I'm just going to skip through and try

1079
00:37:03,520 --> 00:37:05,040
 to find out why Kodak would keep getting

1080
00:37:05,040 --> 00:37:05,760
 a nuclear reactor.

1081
00:37:05,760 --> 00:37:07,280
 Is that originally what photobombing was?

1082
00:37:07,280 --> 00:37:10,320
 It was much more dangerous, yeah.

1083
00:37:10,320 --> 00:37:11,360
 So good.

1084
00:37:11,360 --> 00:37:14,160
 So starting decades ago, Kodak had an interest

1085
00:37:14,160 --> 00:37:16,960
 in neutrons, subatomic particles that can be used

1086
00:37:16,960 --> 00:37:19,440
 to determine the makeup of a given material

1087
00:37:19,440 --> 00:37:22,080
 or create an image of it without damaging it.

1088
00:37:22,080 --> 00:37:22,160
 Yeah, you can see that.

1089
00:37:22,160 --> 00:37:24,960
 OK, so you can fire neutrons at something

1090
00:37:24,960 --> 00:37:26,000
 and get an image of it.

1091
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:29,600
 And to do that, you need to create a nuclear reactor

1092
00:37:29,600 --> 00:37:31,680
 in order to generate a bunch of neutrons, I guess.

1093
00:37:31,680 --> 00:37:31,920
 Wow.

1094
00:37:31,920 --> 00:37:32,880
 How else are you going to do it?

1095
00:37:32,880 --> 00:37:33,680
 That's incredible.

1096
00:37:33,680 --> 00:37:34,400
 Can I do one?

1097
00:37:34,400 --> 00:37:34,880
 Yeah.

1098
00:37:34,880 --> 00:37:37,760
 Elizabeth Royce writes, "There's a bridge in West Virginia

1099
00:37:37,760 --> 00:37:40,880
 which was only fixed after the Soviet Union intervened."

1100
00:37:40,880 --> 00:37:43,360
 This is great.

1101
00:37:43,360 --> 00:37:45,600
 So I sort of looked up what was going on here

1102
00:37:45,600 --> 00:37:46,880
 and basically it was an article about it

1103
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:48,480
 on the Blue Ridge Country website.

1104
00:37:48,480 --> 00:37:50,960
 It's called Vulcan, this place, this tiny town.

1105
00:37:50,960 --> 00:37:53,120
 Very few people living there.

1106
00:37:53,120 --> 00:37:54,720
 They had no safe way to drive out of town

1107
00:37:54,720 --> 00:37:57,280
 because there was a bridge that collapsed in 1974.

1108
00:37:57,280 --> 00:37:58,560
 The only way you could get in and out

1109
00:37:58,560 --> 00:38:01,040
 was to drive up the Kentucky side of the tug,

1110
00:38:01,040 --> 00:38:02,320
 which I guess is the river,

1111
00:38:02,320 --> 00:38:04,400
 and walk across a narrow, swinging bridge.

1112
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:06,480
 Children had to crawl under parked railroad cars

1113
00:38:06,480 --> 00:38:08,240
 at the railroad's bridge to get to school.

1114
00:38:08,240 --> 00:38:10,480
 One child lost a leg doing that.

1115
00:38:10,480 --> 00:38:13,280
 So just like horrible situation and, you know,

1116
00:38:13,280 --> 00:38:14,080
 just a nightmare.

1117
00:38:14,080 --> 00:38:15,120
 They can't get in and out of town.

1118
00:38:15,120 --> 00:38:17,600
 And this guy called John Robinette,

1119
00:38:17,600 --> 00:38:20,000
 who was the self-appointed mayor apparently,

1120
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:23,600
 wrote to the Soviet Embassy in 1977 in Whattington, DC,

1121
00:38:23,600 --> 00:38:26,320
 describing Vulcan's plight and requesting foreign aid for a bridge.

1122
00:38:26,320 --> 00:38:31,920
 And the Soviets dispatched a journalist who reported back saying,

1123
00:38:31,920 --> 00:38:33,120
 "Yes, of course, we'll fund your bridge.

1124
00:38:33,120 --> 00:38:35,440
 If America can't do this, we will pay for it."

1125
00:38:35,440 --> 00:38:36,560
 Nice.

1126
00:38:36,560 --> 00:38:38,000
 Because of the PR, PR coup.

1127
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:40,160
 Within hours of that journalist visiting,

1128
00:38:40,160 --> 00:38:42,400
 word came down from the governor saying,

1129
00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:44,480
 "Yeah, we'll build a bridge. We'll build a bridge."

1130
00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:45,200
 And there we go.

1131
00:38:45,200 --> 00:38:48,240
 They kept the promise and eventually the bridge was delivered.

1132
00:38:48,240 --> 00:38:49,200
 According to news reports,

1133
00:38:49,200 --> 00:38:52,080
 Vulcan residents celebrated with illegally imported Russian vodka.

1134
00:38:52,080 --> 00:38:52,560
 Nice.

1135
00:38:52,560 --> 00:38:53,840
 In the American flag hung high.

1136
00:38:53,840 --> 00:38:54,800
 That's a good story.

1137
00:38:54,800 --> 00:38:55,840
 Mia Tappin says,

1138
00:38:55,840 --> 00:38:59,360
 "A lone word is a word borrowed from another language.

1139
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:04,400
 A calque is a direct translation of one word into another language."

1140
00:39:04,400 --> 00:39:05,200
 See?

1141
00:39:05,200 --> 00:39:06,320
 Subtle difference.

1142
00:39:06,320 --> 00:39:06,960
 Remember that.

1143
00:39:06,960 --> 00:39:10,160
 The word calque, and bear in mind my spelling this,

1144
00:39:10,160 --> 00:39:12,000
 C-A-L-Q-U-E,

1145
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:14,640
 the word calque is an example of a lone word

1146
00:39:14,640 --> 00:39:16,640
 because it comes from the French word calque.

1147
00:39:16,640 --> 00:39:19,840
 And the word lone word is an example of a calque

1148
00:39:19,840 --> 00:39:23,200
 because it's directly translated from German as lane word,

1149
00:39:23,200 --> 00:39:24,320
 meaning lone word.

1150
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:25,520
 That's super.

1151
00:39:25,520 --> 00:39:26,400
 So good.

1152
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:26,960
 Wow.

1153
00:39:26,960 --> 00:39:28,080
 I love that.

1154
00:39:28,080 --> 00:39:29,440
 Yeah, that's amazing.

1155
00:39:29,440 --> 00:39:30,080
 Here's a fun one.

1156
00:39:30,080 --> 00:39:31,280
 This is from Dan Maynard.

1157
00:39:31,280 --> 00:39:33,840
 "Hey, I have a fun fact about Aussie Osborne.

1158
00:39:33,840 --> 00:39:35,520
 I tried sending it to James on Instagram,

1159
00:39:35,520 --> 00:39:36,560
 but not sure if you'll see it."

1160
00:39:36,560 --> 00:39:40,880
 Sorry, that's not the fact.

1161
00:39:40,880 --> 00:39:42,400
 I don't really know how Instagram works,

1162
00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:43,120
 I'll be honest.

1163
00:39:43,120 --> 00:39:43,760
 I am on it.

1164
00:39:43,760 --> 00:39:45,760
 No such thing as James Harkin.

1165
00:39:45,760 --> 00:39:46,800
 He is.

1166
00:39:46,800 --> 00:39:47,360
 I can prove that,

1167
00:39:47,360 --> 00:39:49,440
 because I watch him post stuff from @shribeland.

1168
00:39:49,440 --> 00:39:51,040
 Jesus Christ.

1169
00:39:51,040 --> 00:39:52,720
 The self-plugging is off the chouser.

1170
00:39:52,720 --> 00:39:54,240
 Anna, anything you want to...?

1171
00:39:54,240 --> 00:39:56,000
 I've got nothing, thanks.

1172
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:56,880
 Well, Dan writes,

1173
00:39:56,880 --> 00:39:58,160
 "If you don't already know the story,

1174
00:39:58,160 --> 00:40:00,880
 in 1972, Black Sabbath were recording Volume 4

1175
00:40:00,880 --> 00:40:02,480
 in a mansion in Bel-Air.

1176
00:40:02,480 --> 00:40:04,240
 Aussie went and adjusted the thermostat

1177
00:40:04,240 --> 00:40:05,440
 and continued on with the day.

1178
00:40:05,440 --> 00:40:07,840
 Next thing, the cops turn up,

1179
00:40:07,840 --> 00:40:08,800
 sirens blaring,

1180
00:40:08,800 --> 00:40:12,160
 and here everyone thinks it's a drug raid in the house

1181
00:40:12,160 --> 00:40:13,440
 and proceeded to flush away

1182
00:40:13,440 --> 00:40:15,280
 and snort as many drugs as possible.

1183
00:40:15,280 --> 00:40:17,040
 It turns out,

1184
00:40:17,040 --> 00:40:19,120
 Aussie had not adjusted the thermostat,

1185
00:40:19,120 --> 00:40:21,040
 he had in fact hit the emergency call button

1186
00:40:21,040 --> 00:40:22,400
 and alerted the local police.

1187
00:40:22,400 --> 00:40:25,280
 And they were just there to check if everything was okay.

1188
00:40:25,280 --> 00:40:27,200
 We're back, we're back.

1189
00:40:28,160 --> 00:40:29,280
 Let's get back.

1190
00:40:29,280 --> 00:40:30,560
 I suppose there's no crime,

1191
00:40:30,560 --> 00:40:32,560
 there's no criminal offence of having taken drugs,

1192
00:40:32,560 --> 00:40:33,760
 even like five minutes ago.

1193
00:40:33,760 --> 00:40:35,840
 That's really interesting,

1194
00:40:35,840 --> 00:40:38,560
 and I think no one's ever properly tried that in court,

1195
00:40:38,560 --> 00:40:40,560
 because I think that is, in theory, that is true,

1196
00:40:40,560 --> 00:40:43,040
 but it's difficult to say that something's never been

1197
00:40:43,040 --> 00:40:44,880
 in your possession if you've taken it,

1198
00:40:44,880 --> 00:40:46,400
 especially as it's in your body.

1199
00:40:46,400 --> 00:40:47,600
 But if you've taken every bit of it,

1200
00:40:47,600 --> 00:40:49,360
 and it's just fizzing around your nervous system,

1201
00:40:49,360 --> 00:40:51,520
 is it, like, is that still possession?

1202
00:40:51,520 --> 00:40:52,960
 Possession is illegal,

1203
00:40:52,960 --> 00:40:56,080
 and if it's in your stomach, arguably, you're possessing it.

1204
00:40:56,080 --> 00:40:58,800
 And it's very difficult to say it's in my stomach,

1205
00:40:58,800 --> 00:41:00,960
 but at no stage did I ever possess it.

1206
00:41:00,960 --> 00:41:02,720
 This is quite a fun one.

1207
00:41:02,720 --> 00:41:05,040
 Chuck Norris once helped deliver a baby on a helicopter?

1208
00:41:05,040 --> 00:41:05,840
 No, he didn't.

1209
00:41:05,840 --> 00:41:08,480
 This is from James Wetter.

1210
00:41:08,480 --> 00:41:10,480
 It happened in 2013.

1211
00:41:10,480 --> 00:41:12,320
 There was a woman in, you know, the Ars of Silly?

1212
00:41:12,320 --> 00:41:13,360
 Yes.

1213
00:41:13,360 --> 00:41:14,640
 When you're pregnant and you're about to give birth,

1214
00:41:14,640 --> 00:41:15,520
 you go to the mainland.

1215
00:41:15,520 --> 00:41:15,760
 Yeah.

1216
00:41:15,760 --> 00:41:19,520
 But she went into labour

1217
00:41:19,520 --> 00:41:22,640
 and then gave birth in mid-air on the helicopter.

1218
00:41:22,640 --> 00:41:23,360
 Okay.

1219
00:41:23,360 --> 00:41:26,000
 And Chuck Norris happened to be on that helicopter flight,

1220
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:26,320
 right?

1221
00:41:26,320 --> 00:41:30,000
 On board the helicopter was Lieutenant Commander Chuck Norris.

1222
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:32,080
 He was the observer on board the helicopter.

1223
00:41:32,080 --> 00:41:33,200
 Come on.

1224
00:41:33,200 --> 00:41:36,800
 And, yeah, the baby was born mid-air.

1225
00:41:36,800 --> 00:41:39,280
 And they took off with seven passengers on board

1226
00:41:39,280 --> 00:41:40,160
 and landed with eight.

1227
00:41:40,160 --> 00:41:41,040
 That's so cool.

1228
00:41:41,040 --> 00:41:42,560
 And then in 2022, it happened again.

1229
00:41:42,560 --> 00:41:44,000
 Chuck Norris again?

1230
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:45,360
 No, don't think so.

1231
00:41:45,360 --> 00:41:46,000
 I'm not sure.

1232
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:49,600
 Here's one for you, Andy.

1233
00:41:49,600 --> 00:41:53,760
 If you're in a certain town in Switzerland,

1234
00:41:53,760 --> 00:41:54,800
 whose name escapes me,

1235
00:41:55,680 --> 00:42:00,400
 once a year, you can get a helicopter ride for six euros fifty.

1236
00:42:00,400 --> 00:42:01,760
 Riddle me this.

1237
00:42:01,760 --> 00:42:03,120
 Is this?

1238
00:42:03,120 --> 00:42:05,200
 Normally, of course, it would cost you a lot of money to get a helicopter.

1239
00:42:05,200 --> 00:42:05,520
 Right, okay.

1240
00:42:05,520 --> 00:42:06,880
 And where is this one, so?

1241
00:42:06,880 --> 00:42:08,320
 It's in Switzerland somewhere.

1242
00:42:08,320 --> 00:42:10,160
 And is this for me because I'm cheap?

1243
00:42:10,160 --> 00:42:12,800
 No, no, it's because you like infrastructure.

1244
00:42:12,800 --> 00:42:16,640
 And, you know, vehicles and stuff like that.

1245
00:42:16,640 --> 00:42:17,840
 So are you hitching a lift on?

1246
00:42:17,840 --> 00:42:18,800
 I've given too much away.

1247
00:42:18,800 --> 00:42:21,360
 Are you hitching a lift because it's flying under a,

1248
00:42:21,360 --> 00:42:24,400
 what do I like, a finicky, a tour finicky railway?

1249
00:42:24,400 --> 00:42:27,680
 It's a bane of moss and everyone's refusing to get in it.

1250
00:42:27,680 --> 00:42:28,800
 So priceless.

1251
00:42:28,800 --> 00:42:30,080
 Think finiculars.

1252
00:42:30,080 --> 00:42:31,120
 That's a link here.

1253
00:42:31,120 --> 00:42:31,600
 Okay.

1254
00:42:31,600 --> 00:42:33,680
 So rather than a funicular helicopter,

1255
00:42:33,680 --> 00:42:36,000
 whereby it's attached to a tower

1256
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:39,280
 and the rotors provide the power to lift it.

1257
00:42:39,280 --> 00:42:40,080
 Brilliant.

1258
00:42:40,080 --> 00:42:41,920
 But you're going by helicopter.

1259
00:42:41,920 --> 00:42:42,400
 I've got it.

1260
00:42:42,400 --> 00:42:43,120
 I think I've got it.

1261
00:42:43,120 --> 00:42:45,360
 Is it a, it's like a rail replacement bus service,

1262
00:42:45,360 --> 00:42:47,520
 except it's a finicular replacement helicopter.

1263
00:42:47,520 --> 00:42:48,000
 Exactly.

1264
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:50,080
 It's now amazing.

1265
00:42:50,080 --> 00:42:52,240
 And they're not allowed to charge more than the finicular.

1266
00:42:52,240 --> 00:42:52,800
 Precisely.

1267
00:42:52,800 --> 00:42:57,200
 So once a year, they have to put the finicular into maintenance,

1268
00:42:57,200 --> 00:42:59,120
 but they still need to get to their village.

1269
00:42:59,120 --> 00:43:02,800
 And so the government puts on a rail replacement helicopter.

1270
00:43:02,800 --> 00:43:04,640
 And of course they can only charge you the amount

1271
00:43:04,640 --> 00:43:06,240
 that you would charge if it was a train.

1272
00:43:06,240 --> 00:43:08,160
 That is so good.

1273
00:43:08,160 --> 00:43:09,280
 I would just wait at the bottom.

1274
00:43:09,280 --> 00:43:09,840
 No, thank you.

1275
00:43:09,840 --> 00:43:10,880
 I don't need to get home.

1276
00:43:10,880 --> 00:43:12,960
 I'll just wait for the finicular to be back in service.

1277
00:43:12,960 --> 00:43:18,720
 There's a fact I said ages ago.

1278
00:43:18,720 --> 00:43:20,800
 And when I say fact, it's something I said out loud

1279
00:43:20,800 --> 00:43:22,000
 that I'd love to confirm.

1280
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:23,200
 And I still haven't confirmed it.

1281
00:43:23,200 --> 00:43:24,560
 And I promise I've been looking, which

1282
00:43:24,560 --> 00:43:26,640
 is that there was a story that Chuck Norris,

1283
00:43:26,640 --> 00:43:28,640
 the actual Chuck Norris actor, as opposed

1284
00:43:28,640 --> 00:43:32,160
 to the helicopter pilot, all of his movies are arguably,

1285
00:43:32,160 --> 00:43:34,800
 I think, a bit B movie-ish, not very good.

1286
00:43:34,800 --> 00:43:36,640
 You'd watch it for the fighting, right?

1287
00:43:36,640 --> 00:43:37,680
 He's got kids.

1288
00:43:37,680 --> 00:43:39,360
 He doesn't want his kids to watch his movies,

1289
00:43:39,360 --> 00:43:40,400
 because it has fighting.

1290
00:43:40,400 --> 00:43:43,200
 So the story is, is that Chuck Norris edits out

1291
00:43:43,200 --> 00:43:45,040
 the fighting scenes from his movies,

1292
00:43:45,040 --> 00:43:49,360
 and then lets his kids just watch the shitty experiments.

1293
00:43:49,360 --> 00:43:50,560
 That's the whole movie.

1294
00:43:50,560 --> 00:43:51,600
 That's so funny.

1295
00:43:51,600 --> 00:43:52,240
 Chuck Norris.

1296
00:43:52,240 --> 00:43:53,920
 But I read it in an interview with him once,

1297
00:43:53,920 --> 00:43:55,040
 and I can't find it anywhere.

1298
00:43:55,040 --> 00:43:55,920
 So I'm still looking.

1299
00:43:55,920 --> 00:43:56,800
 I'm still on the hunt.

1300
00:43:56,800 --> 00:43:57,040
 Wow.

1301
00:43:57,040 --> 00:43:58,080
 That's a great fact.

1302
00:43:58,080 --> 00:44:01,040
 This is a good one from Dylan Difford.

1303
00:44:01,040 --> 00:44:06,320
 In May 2005, the British Department of Trade and Industry

1304
00:44:06,320 --> 00:44:09,200
 was briefly renamed the Department of Productivity, Energy

1305
00:44:09,200 --> 00:44:10,160
 and Industry.

1306
00:44:10,160 --> 00:44:12,480
 But the name was reverted after one week

1307
00:44:12,480 --> 00:44:15,120
 when it was suggested that this made Minister Alan Johnson,

1308
00:44:15,120 --> 00:44:18,480
 if you remember him, the Productivity, Energy,

1309
00:44:18,480 --> 00:44:20,960
 and Industry Secretary, or Penis.

1310
00:44:21,520 --> 00:44:26,320
 I can't imagine Mr. Johnson had any problem with that.

1311
00:44:26,320 --> 00:44:27,920
 Oh, well indeed he did.

1312
00:44:27,920 --> 00:44:28,560
 Very good.

1313
00:44:28,560 --> 00:44:32,240
 I think this is the shortest one we've got from Stuart Marsh.

1314
00:44:32,240 --> 00:44:34,400
 The company that makes square fire extinguishers

1315
00:44:34,400 --> 00:44:35,200
 is called Oval.

1316
00:44:35,200 --> 00:44:39,440
 What?

1317
00:44:39,440 --> 00:44:42,560
 I've never seen a square fire extinguisher.

1318
00:44:42,560 --> 00:44:44,880
 I think I looked it up when that fact came into the inbox,

1319
00:44:44,880 --> 00:44:45,360
 and it's--

1320
00:44:45,360 --> 00:44:46,400
 What an odd thing to have.

1321
00:44:46,400 --> 00:44:47,120
 They're real.

1322
00:44:47,120 --> 00:44:47,520
 They are real.

1323
00:44:47,520 --> 00:44:48,160
 That's amazing.

1324
00:44:48,160 --> 00:44:49,440
 Do we know why?

1325
00:44:49,440 --> 00:44:51,040
 OK, here's an idea.

1326
00:44:51,040 --> 00:44:54,880
 You put them on a ship, and then they won't roll away.

1327
00:44:54,880 --> 00:44:55,280
 Yeah.

1328
00:44:55,280 --> 00:44:56,160
 Brilliant.

1329
00:44:56,160 --> 00:44:56,880
 Very good.

1330
00:44:56,880 --> 00:44:58,080
 Safe all over.

1331
00:44:58,080 --> 00:44:58,320
 Yeah.

1332
00:44:58,320 --> 00:44:58,800
 Nice.

1333
00:44:58,800 --> 00:45:01,680
 And that is the only reason I can possibly take off for a--

1334
00:45:01,680 --> 00:45:04,800
 Easier to stack in the warehouse.

1335
00:45:04,800 --> 00:45:05,040
 Yeah.

1336
00:45:05,040 --> 00:45:09,280
 If I was shopping for a square fire extinguisher

1337
00:45:09,280 --> 00:45:11,680
 and I was a ship captain, I wouldn't open up the website

1338
00:45:11,680 --> 00:45:15,040
 that was OvalExtinguishers.com.

1339
00:45:15,040 --> 00:45:18,400
 This is from Amy Apple, and apparently was also sent in

1340
00:45:18,400 --> 00:45:19,600
 by John Turbow.

1341
00:45:19,600 --> 00:45:20,240
 Yeah.

1342
00:45:20,240 --> 00:45:25,120
 And Turbow was my nickname when I was younger.

1343
00:45:25,120 --> 00:45:25,680
 It was.

1344
00:45:25,680 --> 00:45:28,320
 And John's your brother's name, so is there some sort of--

1345
00:45:28,320 --> 00:45:31,680
 The fact is that a few years ago,

1346
00:45:31,680 --> 00:45:34,480
 Nicholas Fazel, a biology that University of Lausanne

1347
00:45:34,480 --> 00:45:38,400
 in Switzerland and his colleagues developed a fascination

1348
00:45:38,400 --> 00:45:40,800
 with the penises of seratine bats,

1349
00:45:40,800 --> 00:45:42,800
 which is a species found in woodlands and the attics

1350
00:45:42,800 --> 00:45:43,600
 of old buildings.

1351
00:45:43,600 --> 00:45:47,600
 Seratine bats sport abnormally long penises

1352
00:45:47,600 --> 00:45:49,840
 with wide heart-shaped heads.

1353
00:45:49,840 --> 00:45:52,080
 When erect, the members are around seven times longer

1354
00:45:52,080 --> 00:45:54,720
 than the female's vagina, and their bulbous heads

1355
00:45:54,720 --> 00:45:57,840
 are seven times wider than the vaginal opening.

1356
00:45:57,840 --> 00:45:59,920
 Oh, it's a lot of detail, isn't it?

1357
00:45:59,920 --> 00:46:03,200
 Anyway, Fazel wondered, as you would, how does this work?

1358
00:46:03,200 --> 00:46:05,040
 How can they use that for copulation?

1359
00:46:05,040 --> 00:46:06,640
 Long and short of it, as it were.

1360
00:46:06,640 --> 00:46:08,080
 The long and wide--

1361
00:46:08,080 --> 00:46:11,760
 Basically, they hang upside down.

1362
00:46:11,760 --> 00:46:13,920
 The male climbs onto the female's back

1363
00:46:13,920 --> 00:46:15,920
 and gets her neck, as bats do.

1364
00:46:15,920 --> 00:46:18,480
 But then he uses his erect penis

1365
00:46:18,480 --> 00:46:21,520
 to push the female's tail membrane to the side,

1366
00:46:21,520 --> 00:46:24,560
 locates her vulva, and then he just puts his penis

1367
00:46:24,560 --> 00:46:28,160
 on her vagina, and copulates there.

1368
00:46:28,160 --> 00:46:29,520
 So it's more of a--

1369
00:46:29,520 --> 00:46:30,960
 It's more like a cloacal kiss.

1370
00:46:30,960 --> 00:46:33,040
 It's a cloacal kiss, yes.

1371
00:46:33,040 --> 00:46:34,800
 It's a nice way of putting it.

1372
00:46:34,800 --> 00:46:37,040
 God, they do have massive penises, bats.

1373
00:46:37,040 --> 00:46:37,680
 Do you remember I got--

1374
00:46:37,680 --> 00:46:39,040
 Do you not remember?

1375
00:46:39,040 --> 00:46:42,320
 I showed you a photo, and I got sent a picture

1376
00:46:42,320 --> 00:46:44,000
 by Colonel John Blastridge Snell

1377
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:45,280
 when he was out on his expedition.

1378
00:46:45,280 --> 00:46:47,200
 So look at this big bat, and I opened it.

1379
00:46:47,200 --> 00:46:51,360
 It was a bat that strung up with this giant floppy penis.

1380
00:46:51,360 --> 00:46:52,160
 It was huge.

1381
00:46:52,160 --> 00:46:53,760
 It was huge.

1382
00:46:53,760 --> 00:46:54,240
 Wow.

1383
00:46:54,240 --> 00:46:54,800
 I'm still--

1384
00:46:54,800 --> 00:46:57,680
 It's still burnt in my memory as a terrifying image.

1385
00:46:57,680 --> 00:46:58,960
 Holy dick pic, that's bad.

1386
00:46:58,960 --> 00:47:09,440
 Okay, that's it.

1387
00:47:09,440 --> 00:47:10,640
 That's all of your facts.

1388
00:47:10,640 --> 00:47:11,680
 Thank you very much for listening,

1389
00:47:11,680 --> 00:47:13,040

00:47:28,880 --> 00:47:30,560
 but I haven't done any threading.

1398
00:47:30,560 --> 00:47:30,960
 Okay.

1399
00:47:30,960 --> 00:47:32,960
 Exciting.

 A few other endeavors that we're up to.

1413
00:47:53,680 --> 00:47:56,560
 We also have a portal there to Club Fish,

1414
00:47:56,560 --> 00:47:59,760
 the exclusive members lounge,

1415
00:47:59,760 --> 00:48:01,840
 which is a really fun place to be.

1416
00:48:01,840 --> 00:48:02,960
 Isn't that right, guys?

1417
00:48:02,960 --> 00:48:04,320
 It sure is.

1418
00:48:04,320 --> 00:48:05,840
 If you liked what you just heard

1419
00:48:05,840 --> 00:48:07,920
 for the last 40 minutes or so,

1420
00:48:07,920 --> 00:48:10,720
 every month or so we do a Drop As Align,

1421
00:48:10,720 --> 00:48:13,040
 which is of a similar bent.

1422
00:48:13,040 --> 00:48:13,520
 Yeah, yeah.

1423
00:48:13,520 --> 00:48:14,480
 There's bonus stuff.

1424
00:48:14,480 --> 00:48:15,680
 There are ad-free episodes.

1425
00:48:15,680 --> 00:48:19,760
 There's a thriving fan community called Discord.

1426
00:48:19,760 --> 00:48:20,960
 It's on a thing called Discord.

1427
00:48:20,960 --> 00:48:22,080
 I know what Discord is.

1428
00:48:22,080 --> 00:48:23,280
 Don't write it.

1429
00:48:23,280 --> 00:48:25,840
 It's the place where you would probably find out first

1430
00:48:25,840 --> 00:48:27,200
 about new gigs that we're doing.

1431
00:48:27,200 --> 00:48:28,000
 Yeah.

1432
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:30,640
 There's some tempting schmutter on display at Club Fish.

1433
00:48:30,640 --> 00:48:32,320
 So go to NoSuchThingAsAfish.com.

1434
00:48:32,320 --> 00:48:33,040
 Thanks very much.

1435
00:48:33,040 --> 00:48:33,920
 We'll see you next time.

1436
00:48:33,920 --> 00:48:34,320
 Goodbye.

1437
00:48:34,320 --> 00:48:36,320
 Bye.

1438
00:48:36,320 --> 00:48:39,680
 [MUSIC PLAYING]

1439
00:48:39,680 --> 00:48:42,260
 (upbeat music)

1440
00:48:42,260 --> 00:48:44,840
 (upbeat music)
