00:00:12,00:00:15,"Hello and welcome to No Such Thing as a Fish, a weekly podcast coming to you from the QI"
00:00:15,00:00:21,"offices in Hoban. My name is Andrew Hunter Murray, I'm joined by James Harkin, Dan Treiber"
00:00:21,00:00:28,"and Anna Tadzinski, and this is an upside-down Christmasy end of year-y episode, Lord of"
00:00:28,00:00:38,"Mistrule style. I'm in charge. The lunatics have taken over the asylum. Exactly that, and instead of"
00:00:38,00:00:45,"us telling you our facts, you are going to be telling us your facts. No, we will be telling"
00:00:45,00:00:51,"you your facts. That's it. We will be telling each other your facts, but you are allowed to listen."
00:00:53,00:01:00,"You're welcome. Basically, we have the email address, podcast@QI.com, people write in with all"
00:01:00,00:01:04,"sorts of stuff, and if you remember Clubfish, you'll hear every month the kind of things people"
00:01:04,00:01:08,"write in with them, one of our bonus episodes, but also you send in a huge number of brilliant"
00:01:08,00:01:13,"extra facts. So we have just gathered around here, we have a massive pile of different facts from"
00:01:13,00:01:17,"all of you, some of the absolute best ones that have been sent in over the last year or two."
00:01:17,00:01:20,"You know, because we can all dip into the inbox, we might have seen a couple of them,"
00:01:20,00:01:24,"a lot of them we'll have never seen before. Yeah, so would someone like to begin?"
00:01:24,00:01:28,"I got the facts here. Yeah, go on. All right, this is from Haley Dargan. It says,"
00:01:28,00:01:34,"""A team in Darwin, Australia, drove a car named Mudcrab, seven kilometers underwater across the"
00:01:34,00:01:40,harbour. They got bogged down nearly a dozen times and dealt with the threat of crocodiles.
00:01:40,00:01:44,"In doing this, they broke two world records, longest underwater drive and the deepest"
00:01:44,00:01:50,"underwater drive."" Wow. Pretty cool. I didn't, sorry, it's a cut wall kind of car?"
00:01:50,00:01:55,"It's called the Mudcrab and it's, I guess, amphibious and... Drive sideways. Yep."
00:01:55,00:02:02,"That's cool that it can drive underwater. Very much don't try this with your own car,"
00:02:02,00:02:08,"warning, right? Yeah, this is, I bet there's a few alterations they've made to their regular car."
00:02:08,00:02:14,"There's an old, I think it's a Mitch Hedberg joke. There's something like that,"
00:02:15,00:02:20,"which I will absolutely butcher, but it's something like, ""I went on a date with a girl."
00:02:20,00:02:25,It didn't go very well. She was annoyed that I didn't open the doors for her and rather I swam
00:02:25,00:02:35,"straight to the surface."" That's a very good joke. That story reminds me of that story we had in"
00:02:35,00:02:39,"one of our books of the year, our books we did about the news of the year. If you want to catch"
00:02:39,00:02:44,"up on the news of 2018, why don't you go to Amazon and buy it? But one of the stories was about"
00:02:44,00:02:50,"those two Australian women, I think this is right, who were following their sat-nav and just,"
00:02:50,00:02:53,it was somewhere in Australia and they just followed their sat-nav into the ocean.
00:02:53,00:02:58,"Just because the sat-nav had messed up and they just went, ""Must be right, must be right."""
00:02:58,00:03:02,"It's amazing. And their car got stranded in the sea. Do you remember, we mentioned on the podcast,"
00:03:02,00:03:07,"there was a president who had an amphibious car and he used to take, so it wasn't at the White House."
00:03:07,00:03:11,"It was Johnson. It was Johnson, that's right. And he would take his friends out in the car"
00:03:11,00:03:14,and they would go a bit down a hill where there was a lake at the bottom and then he would fake
00:03:14,00:03:18,"losing control. ""Oh God, oh God, what is that?"" And then they would go in the lake, but they'd"
00:03:18,00:03:25,"obviously drive on. Very, very cool. If there's ever a weird wacky thing a president did fact,"
00:03:25,00:03:29,"it's always LBJ, isn't it? It's amazing how time to lose the war in Vietnam."
00:03:29,00:03:34,"You lose the war in Vietnam, yeah, is where I was going. It's amazing. In the last decade or so,"
00:03:34,00:03:42,"we've had such straight down the line presidents happily buttoned up, you know. In the Addo National"
00:03:42,00:03:47,"Park in South Africa, if you're driving along there, dung beetles have the right of way."
00:03:47,00:03:52,"So if you're driving along and a dung beetle crosses the road, you have to just sit there"
00:03:52,00:03:56,"and wait for it. ""How good is everyone's eyesight in this area? Sorry, that's incredible."""
00:03:56,00:04:00,"They are small, but they do push large bowls of dung. ""That's a good point. Yeah, fair enough."""
00:04:00,00:04:04,"And there must be a lot of traffic jams with a lot of cars stopping. Is that,"
00:04:04,00:04:07,"""Can you get out of the car and check?"" No, just a normal beetle, okay, get back in."
00:04:07,00:04:14,"Or a normal poo, yeah. Just a poo in the middle. I'm sure I can't see the beetle, but it must be"
00:04:14,00:04:18,there. Pretty sure it's not moving. That would be breakups. You would hear breakups there. It was
00:04:18,00:04:23,"like, ""Why'd they leave you? Why'd your boyfriend leave you?"" He waited five hours, five hours,"
00:04:23,00:04:28,because there was a random piece of poo sitting on the road. If you do go driving in any of these
00:04:28,00:04:34,"places like I drove in Yellowstone, I think in a few other places like that, you do have a lot"
00:04:34,00:04:40,"of traffic jams, because as soon as there's an animal there, everyone stops and you just kind"
00:04:40,00:04:44,"of sat there at the back. And the first two or three people can all see the animal, but of course,"
00:04:44,00:04:48,then it wanders off and they drive off and everyone else who's in the traffic jam never gets to see it.
00:04:48,00:04:53,"And the elves. The elves of Iceland we've spoken about before. Oh yeah. Well, they believe a lot"
00:04:53,00:04:57,of people in Iceland believe there are elves and they believe they live in rocks. And so if a rock
00:04:57,00:05:01,"finds its way into the middle of the road and it's a believed home of an elf, you can't move the"
00:05:01,00:05:05,"rock, you have to drive around literally maybe going off-road in order to get around it until"
00:05:05,00:05:09,"it's removed safely by the proper authority. Anyway, look guys, I'm sorry, we're moving on to the next"
00:05:09,00:05:16,"fact. Oh, this is actually a bit of an audience feedback one. It's from Dave Clemer. We mentioned"
00:05:16,00:05:23,"the Treaty of Versailles and the rights to champagne or naming champagne. Oh yeah. So Dave said,"
00:05:23,00:05:26,"""I didn't know about that, but it was not shocking given the presence of two other items I knew about"
00:05:26,00:05:30,with the extreme military significance in the Treaty of Versailles. One of them was the patent
00:05:30,00:05:37,"on aspirin, which Bayer, the German pharmaceutical firm, was required to give up. The second is the"
00:05:37,00:05:43,concert pitch for orchestras being standardised such that the A above middle C is 435 Hertz.
00:05:43,00:05:48,"That was in the Treaty of Versailles. I think this is on QI this year, isn't it?"
00:05:48,00:05:52,Amazing. That's incredible. It might be on your TV in about 18 months' time.
00:05:52,00:05:58,"But yeah, the British used to tune their instruments to a different..."
00:05:58,00:06:00,"Actually, everyone came to the British way, did they? I can't remember."
00:06:00,00:06:02,I can't remember. Because they won the First World War.
00:06:02,00:06:05,I can't remember. It was so good. That was what really upset the Germans.
00:06:05,00:06:08,"This is actually the platform on which Hitler built his rise to power, was that?"
00:06:08,00:06:14,"Frequency things. 30 years of Hertz was the slogan he wrote, wasn't it? Thank you."
00:06:14,00:06:20,"Just a quick fact about that. So if you play, I can play the trumpet, for instance, and when you"
00:06:20,00:06:26,"tune to the orchestra, you play a B-flat because everyone plays whatever their"
00:06:27,00:06:31,"notes is tuned to, and then it all comes together, and you can hear if you're slightly flat or"
00:06:31,00:06:35,slightly sharp. But B-flat is also the way you tune a Vuvuzela.
00:06:35,00:06:43,How many orchestras? I think there is one Vuvuzela concerto that someone wrote once.
00:06:43,00:06:48,"That's incredible. That's so good. That's the sad thing, isn't it?"
00:06:48,00:06:53,"So few professional Vuvuzelists get a chance. I wonder when, last time,"
00:06:53,00:06:56,"officially, an instrument's been allowed into the main orchestra posse."
00:06:56,00:07:00,"It's interesting. That's a good point. One of the sort of later,"
00:07:00,00:07:03,"weird brass instruments, you know? Like, weirder than a French horn."
00:07:03,00:07:09,You'll see a theremin often. But that's not part of a classical orchestra.
00:07:09,00:07:11,"Yeah, that's quite neat. That's a great point."
00:07:11,00:07:16,"I remember seeing, I watched a piece once. I can't remember who it was by, shame on me,"
00:07:16,00:07:20,but there was a part for cutlery. Lovely.
00:07:20,00:07:24,"So the percussionist had a load of cutlery there and they would either rattle it,"
00:07:24,00:07:28,"or they would drop it, or whatever. Was it a tuning fork? Brilliant."
00:07:28,00:07:30,There we go. There we go. If you're on fire today.
00:07:30,00:07:32,That's another one. Come on.
00:07:32,00:07:37,"All right, here we go. This is from Tom Whitfield."
00:07:37,00:07:43,"""The world record for highest jump into water is held by Rick Charles at 172 feet."""
00:07:43,00:07:49,"Can I ask, was that how high the water was, or how high he was before he got in the water?"
00:07:50,00:07:53,How would highest jump into water?
00:07:53,00:07:56,"I just thought it might be someone like, for instance, I've been to Lake Titicaca,"
00:07:56,00:07:59,which is the highest navigational lake in the world.
00:07:59,00:08:00,Right.
00:08:00,00:08:02,"If I jumped into Lake Titicaca, I'd like to..."
00:08:02,00:08:02,You've broken this record.
00:08:02,00:08:05,I can see what he was saying. Sorry.
00:08:05,00:08:07,"It's just a fun bit of whimsy from James, though."
00:08:07,00:08:11,"No, I love a fun bit of whimsy. You know me. I get comedy."
00:08:11,00:08:14,I just sometimes like it to be expanded on a little bit.
00:08:14,00:08:17,"So, sorry, that's 20 feet higher than the Statue of Liberty."
00:08:17,00:08:21,An air had to be pumped into the pool to break the surface tension.
00:08:21,00:08:23,"Otherwise, he would have gone splat."
00:08:23,00:08:24,That's amazing.
00:08:24,00:08:27,"I think it's in the '70s or so, because there's footage of it."
00:08:27,00:08:30,"So, I follow the YouTube link that Tom put in the email."
00:08:30,00:08:32,"It's unbelievable, because he's basically on a ladder,"
00:08:32,00:08:34,which is taller than the Statue of Liberty.
00:08:34,00:08:36,You just see so far up.
00:08:36,00:08:38,That's hard to get up the ladder.
00:08:38,00:08:39,I was impressed that he got up the ladder at all.
00:08:39,00:08:40,"I mean, it's stunning."
00:08:40,00:08:43,"We're on the second floor of this building, and I struggled most weeks."
00:08:45,00:08:48,"What's interesting is someone very, very recently,"
00:08:48,00:08:51,"and I've heard the term ""the highest jump into a body of water ever,"""
00:08:51,00:08:54,broke the record just a few days ago.
00:08:54,00:08:56,"So, maybe this is an old email, and possibly it was right at the time."
00:08:56,00:08:59,And he doesn't have water.
00:08:59,00:09:00,It's incredible. You see the footage.
00:09:00,00:09:03,"He's standing on the edge of a cliff, and he throws something."
00:09:03,00:09:03,I don't know what it was.
00:09:03,00:09:06,"It looks like a giant fish, but I don't think it is."
00:09:06,00:09:08,"Into the water, and as soon as it hits and breaks this tension,"
00:09:08,00:09:11,"he jumps and goes in, and it's the new world record."
00:09:11,00:09:12,"Oh, really?"
00:09:12,00:09:14,"Okay, well, it must be my turn to read the facts."
00:09:14,00:09:15,I'll take the one closest to me.
00:09:15,00:09:20,This is from Sam Kavayaro.
00:09:20,00:09:23,"And Sam says, ""I was reading an article about the early human species"
00:09:23,00:09:26,"that coexisted with Homo sapiens,"
00:09:26,00:09:29,and they mentioned the estimates of how many Neanderthals were alive
00:09:29,00:09:31,"at any one time, giving an upper limit,"
00:09:31,00:09:35,and my brain immediately decided to find a relatable reference scale
00:09:35,00:09:38,"and came up with a nearby city that had similar population."""
00:09:38,00:09:40,"So, I thought you might not have a sense"
00:09:40,00:09:43,"of what the population of Olympia, Washington is."
00:09:43,00:09:43,Correct.
00:09:44,00:09:46,Absolutely zero reference for that.
00:09:46,00:09:48,"I think that's the capital of Washington, isn't it, Olympia?"
00:09:48,00:09:50,I don't even know whether that's true or not.
00:09:50,00:09:51,I simply have not...
00:09:51,00:09:53,"I had not heard of Olympia, Washington before now."
00:09:53,00:09:54,It's not the biggest.
00:09:54,00:09:55,It's not Seattle.
00:09:55,00:09:58,"So, I looked up a UK comparison."
00:09:58,00:10:00,"""At the estimated most populous,"
00:10:00,00:10:04,"there were as many Neanderthals as modern humans living in Torquay."""
00:10:04,00:10:09,That would be an excellent episode of Faulty Towers.
00:10:09,00:10:11,That's great.
00:10:11,00:10:12,"Wait, how many was it?"
00:10:12,00:10:13,"52,000."
00:10:13,00:10:14,"52,000, yeah."
00:10:14,00:10:15,That is unbelievable.
00:10:15,00:10:16,"Yeah, that's..."
00:10:16,00:10:17,Wow.
00:10:17,00:10:19,"Actually, that would be a cool premise for something."
00:10:19,00:10:20,"Like, the Neanderthals are here."
00:10:20,00:10:22,"They all live in Torquay, and it's about the..."
00:10:22,00:10:24,Modern-day Torquay.
00:10:24,00:10:24,"Yeah, yeah."
00:10:24,00:10:28,And it's just like the amusing cultural clashes that you get.
00:10:28,00:10:32,Do they remove all of the current population of Torquay
00:10:32,00:10:34,"so the population stays at 52,000,"
00:10:34,00:10:37,"or does the population balloon to 104,000?"
00:10:37,00:10:41,"I think everyone in Torquay is sort of bought out of their homes,"
00:10:41,00:10:43,"and it's like, we need to house exactly this number of people,"
00:10:43,00:10:45,so where can we put them up?
00:10:45,00:10:46,You all go to Exeter.
00:10:46,00:10:48,Exactly that.
00:10:48,00:10:49,"Yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:10:49,00:10:49,Wow.
00:10:49,00:10:50,Yeah.
00:10:50,00:10:53,"So, yeah, there were also 1,000 more Neanderthals in the world"
00:10:53,00:10:56,at their peak than there are currently inhabitants
00:10:56,00:10:57,of the county of Rutland.
00:10:57,00:10:59,Very nice.
00:10:59,00:11:02,"So, I mean, I reckon that I have more knowledge"
00:11:02,00:11:04,about the city of Olympia in Washington
00:11:04,00:11:06,than I do about the county of Rutland.
00:11:06,00:11:08,I've had my notes the smallest county.
00:11:08,00:11:09,"I live very near it,"
00:11:09,00:11:12,and I can tell you the difference between the people there
00:11:12,00:11:12,and Neanderthals.
00:11:12,00:11:13,Right.
00:11:13,00:11:15,"Oh, there we go."
00:11:15,00:11:15,Ouch.
00:11:15,00:11:16,That's a good slagic.
00:11:16,00:11:19,"Rutland used to be a proper county,"
00:11:19,00:11:22,and I believe it's now a unitary authority.
00:11:22,00:11:23,"So, much like the Neanderthal,"
00:11:23,00:11:25,it's actually sort of faded into the past.
00:11:25,00:11:25,Wow.
00:11:25,00:11:26,Really?
00:11:26,00:11:27,"The county of Rutland, yes."
00:11:27,00:11:28,I thought it was still a county.
00:11:28,00:11:30,"Actually, interesting, the people of Rutland"
00:11:30,00:11:34,"do bury their dead with flowers and trinkets,"
00:11:34,00:11:38,and a rumoured to have mastered fire.
00:11:38,00:11:39,Wow.
00:11:39,00:11:41,"And actually, if you get yourself tested,"
00:11:41,00:11:42,"you are often,"
00:11:42,00:11:44,you are between one and three percent Rutland.
00:11:44,00:11:49,But I've got another one here from David Saunders.
00:11:49,00:11:52,The British basketball league is having to change its name
00:11:52,00:11:54,"as no one can Google it,"
00:11:54,00:11:56,because the acronym is shared with a surgical procedure
00:11:56,00:11:57,that's become very popular in recent years.
00:11:57,00:11:59,Our Brazilian butt lift.
00:11:59,00:12:03,That's brilliant.
00:12:03,00:12:05,The league's new logo looks more like it's advertising
00:12:05,00:12:07,the surgery than the basketball.
00:12:07,00:12:08,It's true.
00:12:08,00:12:09,"I've seen the new logo and it's a big,"
00:12:09,00:12:11,it's a big Bulbas B.
00:12:11,00:12:11,I'll put it that way.
00:12:11,00:12:13,It does.
00:12:13,00:12:15,It looks a bit like in Bambus.
00:12:15,00:12:16,How interesting.
00:12:16,00:12:16,It's been lifted.
00:12:16,00:12:18,That's cool.
00:12:18,00:12:20,Do you think having a big Brazilian butt
00:12:20,00:12:22,would help you in the basketball?
00:12:22,00:12:23,Unquestionably.
00:12:23,00:12:23,I don't know.
00:12:23,00:12:24,Of course.
00:12:24,00:12:25,"If you've got me there, yeah."
00:12:25,00:12:27,You're space-hoppering your way along the court on that thing?
00:12:27,00:12:28,Yeah.
00:12:28,00:12:30,You don't bounce on your arse in basketball.
00:12:30,00:12:32,"I think that's a travel violation, yeah."
00:12:32,00:12:37,But do you think like if Kobe Bryant
00:12:37,00:12:39,"was jumping and doing a basket,"
00:12:39,00:12:41,"he might say to someone,"
00:12:41,00:12:42,"""Can you smell my arse?"""
00:12:42,00:12:44,"That was a thing, right?"
00:12:44,00:12:46,"That was a, yeah, yeah."
00:12:46,00:12:47,Just tell me how my arse tastes.
00:12:47,00:12:53,Grandad cried.
00:12:53,00:12:59,"Because you're up your bum to the other guy's face, right?"
00:12:59,00:13:01,"I was thinking, yeah."
00:13:01,00:13:02,What was the story?
00:13:02,00:13:04,It was like Shaquille O'Neal and Ed.
00:13:04,00:13:04,"Yeah, okay, be right."
00:13:04,00:13:07,"That's like, I just had such a flashback"
00:13:07,00:13:08,to when I was a kid.
00:13:08,00:13:09,"You know, when you used to get so embarrassed,"
00:13:09,00:13:11,your mum's singing along the really wrong words
00:13:11,00:13:12,to modern songs.
00:13:12,00:13:15,And I just felt that shiver hearing you say that.
00:13:15,00:13:16,You know what?
00:13:16,00:13:18,It was in the same episode that we mentioned that
00:13:18,00:13:20,"as the darts, players,"
00:13:20,00:13:22,where one of them farted and put the other one up.
00:13:22,00:13:23,"Oh, yeah."
00:13:23,00:13:24,So that's why I'm conflating.
00:13:24,00:13:25,"Yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:13:25,00:13:25,See?
00:13:25,00:13:27,"I think that's a good, I think that's..."
00:13:27,00:13:29,"Don't listen to these guys, James."
00:13:29,00:13:32,"I think that's a really good, like,"
00:13:32,00:13:34,punk line for you in whatever sport you are.
00:13:34,00:13:36,"Okay, smell my arse."
00:13:36,00:13:37,That's my arse.
00:13:37,00:13:40,"When I'm playing Scrabble over Christmas,"
00:13:40,00:13:43,I got to say it to my hitmoss.
00:13:43,00:13:45,He has smelled my arse.
00:13:45,00:13:49,"Oh, my God."
00:13:49,00:13:49,Brilliant.
00:13:49,00:13:56,Here's one.
00:13:56,00:13:58,Ludwig Umeyer.
00:13:58,00:13:59,"In Cuban and other cigar factories,"
00:13:59,00:14:02,it used to be common to have a person to read aloud
00:14:02,00:14:04,to the cigar rollers while they worked.
00:14:04,00:14:04,"Oh, yes."
00:14:04,00:14:06,And the Monte Cristo cigar brand got its name
00:14:06,00:14:08,because the Count of Monte Cristo
00:14:08,00:14:09,was an extremely popular choice
00:14:09,00:14:10,for the workers to listen to.
00:14:10,00:14:11,That's incredible.
00:14:11,00:14:12,That's interesting.
00:14:12,00:14:13,"I heard the story one, I think."
00:14:13,00:14:14,Yeah.
00:14:14,00:14:15,I think we told that on the show at one point.
00:14:15,00:14:16,"Oh, did we?"
00:14:16,00:14:16,"Sorry, okay."
00:14:16,00:14:18,"Yeah, but that's a great extra detail."
00:14:18,00:14:20,"Yeah, that's the bit that I think is amazing,"
00:14:20,00:14:21,"really, the Monte Cristo bit."
00:14:21,00:14:22,It's such a long bit.
00:14:22,00:14:22,"It is long, yeah."
00:14:22,00:14:24,You could watch Sony Cigar as well listening to that.
00:14:24,00:14:26,It's long but quite exciting.
00:14:26,00:14:29,"And also, it's not very, I would say..."
00:14:29,00:14:31,"You don't really need to remember what happened at the start,"
00:14:31,00:14:33,"so you could, like, swoop in and swoop out a bit,"
00:14:33,00:14:34,"because it's just him and his adventures, isn't it?"
00:14:34,00:14:36,It almost feels like the second half
00:14:36,00:14:36,is a bit like a comic book.
00:14:36,00:14:38,"There's, like, a 300-page digression in Paris"
00:14:38,00:14:39,in the middle bit.
00:14:39,00:14:40,"Yeah, I know, but that's..."
00:14:40,00:14:42,But you don't need to know what's happened before.
00:14:42,00:14:43,"It's just, like, there's this rich dude"
00:14:43,00:14:44,having a bloody whale of a time.
00:14:44,00:14:45,Yeah.
00:14:45,00:14:49,"On Cuba, Fidel Castro once ate 18 bowls of ice cream"
00:14:49,00:14:50,in a single sitting.
00:14:50,00:14:52,Okay.
00:14:52,00:14:53,"Yeah, he just liked ice cream."
00:14:53,00:14:55,"As like, oh, that wasn't a challenge."
00:14:55,00:14:55,It wasn't a challenge.
00:14:55,00:14:56,He really liked ice cream.
00:14:56,00:14:58,"There was a big thing in Cuba,"
00:14:58,00:14:59,"which we might have mentioned before,"
00:14:59,00:15:01,"about milk and stuff like that,"
00:15:01,00:15:04,and being able to feed the country with amazing cows
00:15:04,00:15:05,and stuff like that.
00:15:05,00:15:08,So it was partly an advertising thing
00:15:08,00:15:10,"about how great our milk is,"
00:15:10,00:15:12,but it was also partly he just loved ice cream.
00:15:12,00:15:12,Right.
00:15:12,00:15:13,His sister died this year.
00:15:13,00:15:14,His sister passed away.
00:15:14,00:15:15,Yeah.
00:15:15,00:15:15,Really?
00:15:15,00:15:15,Yeah.
00:15:15,00:15:18,"She was a double agent, basically."
00:15:18,00:15:20,"She, to begin with, loved Castro,"
00:15:20,00:15:22,"and then when he took over,"
00:15:22,00:15:24,and then he continued to sort of go in a direction
00:15:24,00:15:25,"that was bad, she went,"
00:15:25,00:15:26,"hang on a second, I thought you were going to be good"
00:15:26,00:15:28,"when you got into power, and he wasn't."
00:15:28,00:15:29,And so she left Cuba.
00:15:29,00:15:30,I can't remember where she went.
00:15:30,00:15:32,"And, yeah, he became a spy,"
00:15:32,00:15:34,and was really a big part in his downfall.
00:15:34,00:15:35,Sorry he didn't have a downfall.
00:15:35,00:15:36,He...
00:15:36,00:15:37,"Sorry, sorry."
00:15:37,00:15:38,"Sorry, sorry."
00:15:38,00:15:40,He basically outlasted 10 U.S. presidents.
00:15:40,00:15:40,Sorry.
00:15:40,00:15:44,"Like, she was the worst spy ever."
00:15:44,00:15:47,I guess that's where the double agent bit comes in.
00:15:47,00:15:49,She's actually doing a four keeper.
00:15:49,00:15:51,"Yeah, I'll make sure I bring him down."
00:15:51,00:15:53,"Next week, honestly, he's coming down."
00:15:53,00:15:57,One of the first facts I remember discovering for QI
00:15:57,00:15:59,was in a cigar magazine about Kennedy
00:15:59,00:16:01,when he placed the embargo on Cuba.
00:16:01,00:16:04,His last move before that was to order
00:16:04,00:16:06,"a couple of suitcases of Cuban cigars, wasn't it?"
00:16:06,00:16:07,"Well, he would have them sent over to him,"
00:16:07,00:16:10,and then the gates came down.
00:16:10,00:16:12,I love though that they would discover that fact in Cuba
00:16:12,00:16:15,while someone's reading out a biography of JFK
00:16:15,00:16:17,as part of the Rolex system.
00:16:17,00:16:17,Yes.
00:16:17,00:16:18,He did what?
00:16:18,00:16:20,The factory workers.
00:16:20,00:16:22,Shall I take another?
00:16:22,00:16:22,"Yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:16:22,00:16:23,Back to from the middle.
00:16:23,00:16:25,"Okay, again, this is the closest to me."
00:16:25,00:16:26,"So, Rebecca from Ottawa."
00:16:27,00:16:30,"I think not the band, probably the province."
00:16:30,00:16:32,"We'll find out, I guess."
00:16:32,00:16:35,What did Ottawa sing?
00:16:35,00:16:35,Final Count?
00:16:35,00:16:36,"No, not the Final Count."
00:16:36,00:16:38,"That's something really famous, they say."
00:16:38,00:16:39,"Sorry, I don't know."
00:16:39,00:16:41,Final Countdown was when they called Europe.
00:16:41,00:16:42,"Yeah, Ottawa."
00:16:42,00:16:45,"Ottawa, not Ottawa."
00:16:45,00:16:47,They did D-I-S-C-O.
00:16:47,00:16:48,"Oh, that's a big story."
00:16:48,00:16:49,D-I-S-C-O.
00:16:49,00:16:51,"But unfortunately, slightly different names."
00:16:51,00:16:52,"So, Brenda's that whole bit."
00:16:52,00:16:57,"So, Rebecca, who is a person who lives in Ottawa,"
00:16:57,00:16:58,"an Ottawa, you might say."
00:16:58,00:17:01,"Right, say that."
00:17:01,00:17:03,Do you think there's a shop in Ottawa?
00:17:03,00:17:05,Ottawa and Ottomans.
00:17:05,00:17:06,Like a furniture shop.
00:17:06,00:17:06,Yeah.
00:17:06,00:17:07,"There should be, shouldn't there?"
00:17:07,00:17:08,"There should be, yeah."
00:17:08,00:17:11,"Ottawa, Rebecca, writes,"
00:17:11,00:17:15,"""Thought you might enjoy this new story from Canada"
00:17:15,00:17:16,"about a sad goat."""
00:17:16,00:17:18,"She goes on to put the headline,"
00:17:18,00:17:22,"which is ""Mysterious Screams on BC Island,"""
00:17:22,00:17:24,"British Columbia, I imagine."
00:17:24,00:17:26,"""Turn out to be from a sad goat,"
00:17:26,00:17:28,"Royal Canadian Mounted Police say."""
00:17:28,00:17:32,"And yeah, there was basically a lot of sounds"
00:17:32,00:17:36,"in the bottom of a ravine in British Columbia,"
00:17:36,00:17:38,in Quadra Island.
00:17:38,00:17:41,"And the Mounties say it didn't come from a person in distress,"
00:17:41,00:17:42,but rather a sad goat.
00:17:42,00:17:44,"It sounded apparently a bit like,"
00:17:44,00:17:45,"""Help! Help!"""
00:17:45,00:17:49,"Oh, that was great."
00:17:49,00:17:50,Do we know why the goat was so sad?
00:17:50,00:17:51,Yes.
00:17:51,00:17:54,"We, the momma goat's babies had been removed"
00:17:54,00:17:56,and she was calling for them.
00:17:56,00:17:56,Oh.
00:17:56,00:17:57,Been removed.
00:17:57,00:17:57,That is sad.
00:17:57,00:17:59,That has taken a sad turn.
00:17:59,00:17:59,Yeah.
00:17:59,00:18:01,"I'm now, yeah, I'm now siding with her on the dinner."
00:18:01,00:18:04,Could have been just removed temporarily
00:18:04,00:18:05,to go to nursery.
00:18:05,00:18:06,Yes.
00:18:06,00:18:08,"Do you think, do you think that's what it was?"
00:18:08,00:18:11,It's hard to sell.
00:18:11,00:18:14,"Thankfully, officers confirmed all was well"
00:18:14,00:18:16,"and nobody, besides the momma goats,"
00:18:16,00:18:18,was in any kind of distress.
00:18:18,00:18:19,Huh.
00:18:19,00:18:21,"Poor old, poor old momma goat."
00:18:21,00:18:22,Don't know how much we did enjoy that.
00:18:22,00:18:24,Should be looking around at everyone's faces.
00:18:24,00:18:25,Yeah.
00:18:25,00:18:27,It is de-distressing.
00:18:27,00:18:28,It was I...
00:18:28,00:18:30,"Okay, never mind."
00:18:30,00:18:32,It was nice idea for a joke.
00:18:32,00:18:36,"I got one here, which is from Ivor Cardus."
00:18:36,00:18:39,And it's from chapter five of A Very British Murder
00:18:39,00:18:40,by Lucy Walsley.
00:18:40,00:18:43,"And so this is an extract, I think word for word."
00:18:43,00:18:44,"""During the First World War,"
00:18:44,00:18:47,trainee soldiers were frequently set the initiative test
00:18:47,00:18:48,of hiding and spending the night
00:18:48,00:18:50,in Madame Tussaud's Chamber of Horrors.
00:18:50,00:18:52,This caused such inconvenience
00:18:52,00:18:53,that Madame Tussauds was forced officially
00:18:53,00:18:55,"to ask the War Office to stop the practice."""
00:18:55,00:19:00,How many soldiers would fit in Madame Tussaud's Chamber of Horrors
00:19:00,00:19:02,before it became unmanageably...
00:19:02,00:19:02,Yeah.
00:19:02,00:19:04,"Like, poor it's just a military training ground at that point."
00:19:04,00:19:05,What is the Chamber of Horrors?
00:19:05,00:19:06,Is it one room? Is it a whole building?
00:19:06,00:19:10,"No, it's a sort of labyrinthine basement"
00:19:10,00:19:12,"full of, you know, spooky people..."
00:19:12,00:19:13,"It's relatively small, though."
00:19:13,00:19:14,"It's tight, isn't it?"
00:19:14,00:19:15,The corridors.
00:19:15,00:19:16,"Yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:19:16,00:19:18,"People jump out at you, people grab you."
00:19:18,00:19:20,"Yeah, I actually really don't like those"
00:19:20,00:19:22,when actors are jumping out at you.
00:19:22,00:19:24,"I get why people do, but I just find them really teased."
00:19:24,00:19:26,But you love horror films.
00:19:26,00:19:26,Yeah.
00:19:26,00:19:28,"But it's like a live horror film, isn't it?"
00:19:28,00:19:30,"It's not really, it's just people trying to scare you."
00:19:30,00:19:34,"That actually, now you say it, that is quite like a horror film."
00:19:34,00:19:38,"I don't like it because I find both of them equally scary, you know?"
00:19:38,00:19:40,"I don't like ghost rides, all things like that,"
00:19:40,00:19:43,because I have such high hopes and they're always disappointed
00:19:43,00:19:44,because they're never scary enough.
00:19:44,00:19:47,Except the ghost ride at Alton Towers.
00:19:47,00:19:48,I'm absolutely terrified in all of them.
00:19:48,00:19:51,I'm shouting to the people behind me in the ghost train.
00:19:51,00:19:52,Can you smell my ass?
00:19:52,00:19:53,"You know, I'm really."
00:19:53,00:19:59,"In the after World War One,"
00:19:59,00:20:02,"K-World War Two,"
00:20:02,00:20:06,"in World War Two, would Kitchener have been a..."
00:20:06,00:20:07,"No, not Kitchener."
00:20:07,00:20:07,Who was it?
00:20:07,00:20:08,An American.
00:20:08,00:20:09,Who's an American?
00:20:09,00:20:11,General?
00:20:11,00:20:11,General.
00:20:11,00:20:12,Patrick?
00:20:12,00:20:12,Eisenhower?
00:20:12,00:20:14,I can't remember who it was.
00:20:14,00:20:15,Might have begun with K.
00:20:15,00:20:18,"Anyway, an American goes back to France"
00:20:18,00:20:22,and he sees that there's a war grave
00:20:22,00:20:25,that the locals have been looking after for years and years and years.
00:20:25,00:20:29,And what he doesn't have the guts to tell them
00:20:29,00:20:30,is actually they'd mistaken it.
00:20:30,00:20:33,"It wasn't a war grave, it was a toilet."
00:20:33,00:20:37,"And they'd had this kind of like latrine,"
00:20:37,00:20:39,which all the soldiers had used.
00:20:39,00:20:41,"And they'd put something on there to kind of say,"
00:20:41,00:20:43,"""This is the latrine."""
00:20:43,00:20:44,"And the locals, when they came back,"
00:20:44,00:20:46,saw it and thought it was a grave.
00:20:46,00:20:46,No.
00:20:46,00:20:49,"And for 25 years, they were putting flowers down."
00:20:49,00:20:50,"Oh, England."
00:20:50,00:20:51,"Yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:20:51,00:20:53,"But like, did they put a headstone down to mark the latrine?"
00:20:53,00:20:56,Because that would be a weird thing to do for one thing.
00:20:56,00:20:57,It wasn't that.
00:20:57,00:21:00,"It was more like, you know, you put a stick with some flowers."
00:21:00,00:21:01,So the people would know that it was a latrine.
00:21:01,00:21:02,"Oh, no."
00:21:02,00:21:04,"And it was in, whoever it was,"
00:21:04,00:21:07,"it was in his memoirs that he went back there 25 years later,"
00:21:07,00:21:08,and this is what they would do.
00:21:08,00:21:10,Why did he go back to the toilet?
00:21:10,00:21:16,I want to have one final poo to remind me of the good old days.
00:21:16,00:21:18,Back to the area where he was stationed.
00:21:18,00:21:22,"What's awful is that if you squatted and took a poo there,"
00:21:22,00:21:24,you'd probably be arrested for desecration.
00:21:24,00:21:24,Yes.
00:21:24,00:21:25,Such a holy mo-
00:21:25,00:21:27,"And yet, you're the only one doing the right thing."
00:21:27,00:21:28,Yes.
00:21:28,00:21:30,We shout as they dragged you away in chains.
00:21:30,00:21:31,Yeah.
00:21:31,00:21:31,That's a great story.
00:21:31,00:21:32,"Oh, yeah."
00:21:32,00:21:32,"Hannah, you go."
00:21:32,00:21:35,Here's one from Matilda H.
00:21:35,00:21:39,"In 2018, Ikea released an advert designed to be urinated on."
00:21:39,00:21:41,I think we might have said this.
00:21:41,00:21:42,"Yes, I remember this."
00:21:42,00:21:42,We did do this.
00:21:42,00:21:44,It was a pregnancy test.
00:21:44,00:21:45,It was.
00:21:45,00:21:46,Yes.
00:21:46,00:21:48,And it got you a discount on...
00:21:48,00:21:50,Your baby.
00:21:50,00:21:53,Give you a free baby.
00:21:53,00:21:54,You got a crib discount on the crib.
00:21:54,00:21:56,"Yes, it's baby furniture."
00:21:56,00:21:58,"But I mean, not how much furniture baby needs to be on the crib,"
00:21:58,00:21:58,does it?
00:21:58,00:22:00,They don't need a writing desk or a...
00:22:00,00:22:03,A baby shays long.
00:22:03,00:22:05,"Shays short, yeah."
00:22:05,00:22:10,"Yeah, it said a positive pregnancy reading"
00:22:10,00:22:12,would get you a discount of 50%.
00:22:12,00:22:13,"And according to the agency,"
00:22:13,00:22:15,getting the technological aspect of the ad
00:22:15,00:22:16,took some work.
00:22:16,00:22:19,"However, they quote in the email,"
00:22:19,00:22:22,"""The pregnancy test strip was used as a starting point."""
00:22:22,00:22:22,Makes sense.
00:22:22,00:22:25,"""Which relies on antibodies that bind to the pregnancy hormone,"
00:22:25,00:22:26,"HTG, resulting in the color change."""
00:22:26,00:22:30,And did you have to take along the now quite urinary magazine
00:22:30,00:22:30,or whatever it was?
00:22:30,00:22:32,"Yeah, I don't know."
00:22:32,00:22:34,Were they waterproof posters that they put up?
00:22:34,00:22:35,I guess you did.
00:22:35,00:22:36,But it's not a poster.
00:22:36,00:22:38,You can't have people going around peeing on the posters.
00:22:38,00:22:39,Just as releasing an advert.
00:22:39,00:22:40,Don't know what form came in.
00:22:40,00:22:41,"Yeah, doesn't say capable of the TV."
00:22:41,00:22:47,People are trying to get a pissy tally.
00:22:47,00:22:51,So many people were electrocuted by this campaign.
00:22:51,00:22:52,They had to end it.
00:22:52,00:22:52,"Oh, that's great."
00:22:52,00:22:53,That's a great fact.
00:22:53,00:22:54,Here's a good one.
00:22:54,00:22:55,I guess this is from Hailey Inslee.
00:22:55,00:22:57,Mass produced tomatoes in cans.
00:22:57,00:22:59,We're all familiar with those.
00:22:59,00:23:02,"Oh, their existence to Galapagos tortoises."
00:23:02,00:23:04,Is it a riddle me this?
00:23:04,00:23:06,"Yeah, that is a riddle me this, isn't it?"
00:23:06,00:23:06,What is it?
00:23:06,00:23:07,Would you like to have a riddle?
00:23:07,00:23:09,Is there any chance we can get it?
00:23:09,00:23:09,No.
00:23:10,00:23:13,"So, famously on the beagle,"
00:23:13,00:23:17,"all the giant tortoises that were brought back were eaten as food, right?"
00:23:17,00:23:19,"So, you've got a giant turtle that's been eaten,"
00:23:19,00:23:22,"but you've not got the turtle, but you've got the shell."
00:23:22,00:23:26,Is it possible that any of the fruit and veg that was on the boat
00:23:26,00:23:29,was then stored inside the empty shells?
00:23:29,00:23:29,Really?
00:23:29,00:23:32,"And it kind of kept them fresh enough that they thought,"
00:23:32,00:23:33,"oh, we should be storing it."
00:23:33,00:23:34,That is really good.
00:23:34,00:23:34,That's really good.
00:23:34,00:23:35,That's very plausible.
00:23:35,00:23:37,"Can I have another guess, assuming that that's not right?"
00:23:37,00:23:37,Yeah.
00:23:38,00:23:42,Tomatoes you get in a tin are a very special species
00:23:42,00:23:43,"that are not the normal tomatoes you get,"
00:23:43,00:23:45,because they work better in tins.
00:23:45,00:23:50,And these species of tomatoes where the seeds went through a turtle
00:23:50,00:23:53,and in the turtle's poo and grew out of turtle poo.
00:23:53,00:23:53,Very good.
00:23:53,00:23:55,Do you know James is actually closest here?
00:23:55,00:23:56,"Oh, wow."
00:23:56,00:23:58,"I'm going to give James the point, because that's..."
00:23:58,00:23:59,"So, okay, I'll tell you what it is."
00:23:59,00:24:00,It's sort of a bit like that.
00:24:00,00:24:02,"Okay, when you pick a..."
00:24:02,00:24:04,"Oh, and you should all have been saying tortoises throughout."
00:24:04,00:24:07,"Sorry, I'll take another point."
00:24:07,00:24:11,"When you pick a tomato, that short section of stem that comes with it,"
00:24:11,00:24:14,"you know, that little spidery bit, is the callix."
00:24:14,00:24:17,And there's a tiny bit of stem breaking off from a joint
00:24:17,00:24:18,"which is called the pedicel, right?"
00:24:18,00:24:20,"So for many years, these sharp stubs meant you couldn't put them"
00:24:20,00:24:22,"into automatic harvesting bins,"
00:24:22,00:24:25,"because you'd end up with sharp stubs in the can, right?"
00:24:25,00:24:29,"But an American botanist called Charles Rick, two first names,"
00:24:29,00:24:32,"discovered a tomato plant with jointless pedicels,"
00:24:32,00:24:35,but he couldn't get them to germinate.
00:24:35,00:24:39,The only solution he found as a last ditch was to feed the seeds to some tortoises.
00:24:39,00:24:41,The seeds then germinated quickly.
00:24:41,00:24:42,He bred from them.
00:24:42,00:24:42,"Within a couple of years,"
00:24:42,00:24:45,all mass-produced tinted tomatoes could be machine harvested.
00:24:45,00:24:46,- Wow! - So I think...
00:24:46,00:24:49,"- James is amazing. - But also, Charles Rick,"
00:24:49,00:24:51,what amazing lateral thinking going...
00:24:51,00:24:54,The only way I can do this is to feed it through an animal.
00:24:54,00:24:57,"He must have tried various different things,"
00:24:57,00:24:58,"even different animals before then, I would think."
00:24:58,00:25:00,"Yeah, that's incredible."
00:25:00,00:25:01,"No, you're right."
00:25:01,00:25:03,I got one here from Jeff Houghton.
00:25:03,00:25:06,"Check out a guy by the name of Francis Wharton,"
00:25:06,00:25:09,"a backwards man, I think, British Columbia, who in the..."
00:25:09,00:25:09,A backwards...
00:25:09,00:25:11,"Backwards, rather than backwards, right?"
00:25:11,00:25:13,"From the backwards, not..."
00:25:13,00:25:14,He's a backwards man.
00:25:14,00:25:15,Yeah.
00:25:15,00:25:18,"British Columbia, who in the 1960s shot a deer,"
00:25:18,00:25:21,"used its teeth to make his own dentures,"
00:25:21,00:25:24,then used them to eat the deer with its own teeth.
00:25:24,00:25:26,- Wow! - Blimey.
00:25:26,00:25:28,"That's incredible, if true."
00:25:28,00:25:29,I've got a question.
00:25:29,00:25:30,Yeah.
00:25:30,00:25:31,Do deer have canine teeth?
00:25:31,00:25:33,"You wouldn't have thought so, would you?"
00:25:33,00:25:34,I would have thought they're mostly molar-based
00:25:34,00:25:35,for all the plants they eat.
00:25:35,00:25:38,- Yeah. - You wouldn't want to eat sort of live prey.
00:25:38,00:25:39,"But you can sharpen, right?"
00:25:39,00:25:41,"Presumably, that's what he was doing."
00:25:41,00:25:42,He probably shaved them to size.
00:25:42,00:25:42,Yeah.
00:25:42,00:25:45,Which animal's teeth would you most like to have in your mouth?
00:25:45,00:25:45,What a great question.
00:25:45,00:25:49,"Well, what about the sheep's head fish"
00:25:49,00:25:50,"that we mentioned the other day,"
00:25:50,00:25:52,which has the teeth of human teeth?
00:25:52,00:25:53,I wouldn't want those.
00:25:53,00:25:54,I would want...
00:25:54,00:25:54,"Okay, wow."
00:25:54,00:25:57,"I mean, shark's teeth, where they grow on a conveyor belt."
00:25:57,00:25:58,"Sorry, just on Anna's point."
00:25:58,00:25:59,"I guess the question is,"
00:25:59,00:26:02,"are you doing it to improve yourself,"
00:26:02,00:26:05,"or has some evil demon come to you saying,"
00:26:05,00:26:07,"""You must have another animal's teeth,"""
00:26:07,00:26:10,"in which case, Anna's idea is quite clever,"
00:26:10,00:26:10,"because you're like,"
00:26:10,00:26:12,"""Well, basically, I'm just getting human teeth back."""
00:26:12,00:26:14,"You're tricking the demon, though."
00:26:14,00:26:14,Yeah.
00:26:14,00:26:15,"I think the demon will say,"
00:26:15,00:26:17,"""And it can't be the sheep's head fish."""
00:26:17,00:26:18,It's a nice try.
00:26:18,00:26:19,Yeah.
00:26:19,00:26:20,That wasn't in the contract.
00:26:20,00:26:22,I want...
00:26:22,00:26:25,You know how blue whales have that sort of...
00:26:25,00:26:26,Baleen.
00:26:26,00:26:26,Yeah.
00:26:26,00:26:26,"No, no."
00:26:26,00:26:28,There's huge plates of...
00:26:28,00:26:29,Where you...
00:26:29,00:26:30,Baleen.
00:26:30,00:26:30,Baleen.
00:26:30,00:26:31,Yeah.
00:26:31,00:26:33,The system whereby that you can only get krill through.
00:26:33,00:26:34,"Yeah, because it's called baleen."
00:26:34,00:26:35,Yeah.
00:26:35,00:26:35,There we go.
00:26:35,00:26:35,I don't...
00:26:35,00:26:37,I don't baleen.
00:26:37,00:26:38,Oh!
00:26:38,00:26:38,What's that?
00:26:38,00:26:40,It's what blue whales have.
00:26:40,00:26:42,That's a nice idea.
00:26:42,00:26:42,Yeah.
00:26:42,00:26:44,"So then every meal, every dinner party I go to,"
00:26:44,00:26:46,"it's like, ""Oh, the guy who can only eat krills coming."""
00:26:46,00:26:46,We've got to...
00:26:46,00:26:50,"Kate, hundreds of thousands of krill food."
00:26:50,00:26:52,"Got one vegetarian, one vegan, and the krill guys,"
00:26:52,00:26:54,and there's nothing that'll please all of them.
00:26:54,00:26:57,"Guys, Dan, I've just realized,"
00:26:57,00:26:59,I don't think you have any canines.
00:26:59,00:27:00,Oh.
00:27:00,00:27:01,Really?
00:27:01,00:27:02,Holy moly.
00:27:02,00:27:02,Look at that.
00:27:02,00:27:03,Holy moly.
00:27:03,00:27:07,"So normally you've got two in the middle,"
00:27:07,00:27:09,"two on the sides, then two canines, right?"
00:27:09,00:27:11,Where are your third teeth out?
00:27:11,00:27:12,They're completely flat.
00:27:12,00:27:13,"Dan, whoa."
00:27:13,00:27:16,"You're the newly evolved human,"
00:27:16,00:27:17,"because we don't need our canines anymore,"
00:27:17,00:27:18,because we have cutlery.
00:27:18,00:27:19,So well done.
00:27:19,00:27:21,"Hang on, I find it really hard to bite things these days."
00:27:21,00:27:23,"Yeah, you can see Anna's canine's right there."
00:27:23,00:27:25,"No, honestly, this is incredible."
00:27:25,00:27:27,"So, you know, when you go to the pub and you buy a pack of crisps,"
00:27:27,00:27:30,"and often you want to open it up so that everyone can eat it,"
00:27:30,00:27:31,you might bite into it.
00:27:31,00:27:32,"For years I could do that,"
00:27:32,00:27:34,"and then suddenly, five years ago, I can't bite."
00:27:34,00:27:35,I can't get through.
00:27:35,00:27:36,Someone's come and shaved your teeth in the night.
00:27:36,00:27:38,Holy moly.
00:27:38,00:27:40,"Well, there you go."
00:27:40,00:27:41,"We've learned an interesting fact today,"
00:27:41,00:27:46,"and here's another one from Jeff Partica,"
00:27:46,00:27:48,who opens with an admission.
00:27:48,00:27:51,"He says, ""I may have a fact-sharing problem."
00:27:51,00:27:52,"Thanks for letting us know,"
00:27:52,00:27:54,but I'd be remiss if I didn't share at least one.
00:27:54,00:27:56,"I myself do not hunt,"
00:27:56,00:27:58,with this fact being one good reason.
00:27:58,00:27:59,"In any given year,"
00:27:59,00:28:02,"Michigan, Wisconsin, Minnesota, and Pennsylvania"
00:28:02,00:28:06,"combine to issue over 2.5 million deer hunting licenses,"
00:28:06,00:28:07,"which, if an organized group,"
00:28:07,00:28:10,"would be the largest standing army in the world."""
00:28:10,00:28:13,"Knowing some hunters, though,"
00:28:13,00:28:17,"generally speaking, organized would not be the word I do for them."
00:28:17,00:28:21,Isn't that the idea of Americans being able to bear arms?
00:28:21,00:28:22,Certainly is.
00:28:22,00:28:24,"In case the government goes rogue,"
00:28:24,00:28:26,there is automatically a standing army there.
00:28:26,00:28:27,Right.
00:28:27,00:28:28,I think that's one of the arguments.
00:28:28,00:28:29,"Yeah, yeah."
00:28:29,00:28:32,Or in case the deer finally get their act together
00:28:32,00:28:34,and rub out on mass.
00:28:34,00:28:34,"Yeah, yeah."
00:28:34,00:28:35,Claim back their teeth.
00:28:35,00:28:36,I haven't done one for a while.
00:28:36,00:28:37,"Yeah, go for it."
00:28:37,00:28:37,Go for it.
00:28:37,00:28:37,Can I read this?
00:28:37,00:28:41,This is from Noa de Koening from the Netherlands.
00:28:41,00:28:44,"""Today I found out that the timer on your washing machine"
00:28:44,00:28:47,"doesn't just feel wrong, it often is."
00:28:47,00:28:50,The timer on your washing machine is an estimation
00:28:50,00:28:52,based on the weight of your laundry
00:28:52,00:28:55,"or, inverted commas, load sense,"
00:28:55,00:28:57,"and it adjusts itself as it goes."""
00:28:57,00:28:58,That's incredible.
00:28:58,00:28:59,"Oh, my God."
00:28:59,00:29:00,Is it Noa?
00:29:00,00:29:01,"Yeah, no."
00:29:01,00:29:04,"Noa, you've saved the world for the second time today,"
00:29:04,00:29:06,because that is...
00:29:06,00:29:08,My mind is blown.
00:29:08,00:29:10,"I've wandered this for years, haven't we all?"
00:29:10,00:29:12,Because how often have we looked
00:29:12,00:29:14,"at the last minutes of the washing machine,"
00:29:14,00:29:15,"especially when you're desperate,"
00:29:15,00:29:15,it's just before you go to bed
00:29:15,00:29:17,and you're desperate to take it out?
00:29:17,00:29:19,"And apparently, because I did see this one,"
00:29:19,00:29:19,"I looked into it,"
00:29:19,00:29:22,the last minutes are specifically the ones
00:29:22,00:29:24,where the timing messes up quite a lot.
00:29:24,00:29:26,"Is it because there's less water,"
00:29:26,00:29:27,"so they're less heavy, maybe?"
00:29:27,00:29:30,It's because the cycle...
00:29:30,00:29:31,What's happening in the cycle in the last minutes
00:29:31,00:29:33,"is they're spinning it around,"
00:29:33,00:29:34,so it's to do with water.
00:29:34,00:29:37,It's trying to shed the excess water.
00:29:37,00:29:39,"So, depending on the density of your wash,"
00:29:39,00:29:41,the water can be much greater
00:29:41,00:29:43,than the washing machine has estimated at the end.
00:29:43,00:29:44,"So, yes, it'll spin for longer and longer,"
00:29:44,00:29:46,and that's why they're agonizing.
00:29:46,00:29:47,"When you go in eight minutes,"
00:29:47,00:29:48,"you go in eight minutes later,"
00:29:48,00:29:49,"it's seven minutes, whatever,"
00:29:49,00:29:50,it's really annoying.
00:29:50,00:29:51,That's a great fact.
00:29:51,00:29:52,"Thank you, Noa."
00:29:52,00:29:52,Incredible.
00:29:52,00:29:54,"Can we just say, Dan has lined up"
00:29:54,00:29:55,loads of facts before him.
00:29:55,00:29:56,"Like, he's sort of doing"
00:29:56,00:29:58,monopoly money collection over here.
00:29:58,00:29:59,"No, they just happen to be facing me."
00:29:59,00:30:00,"Oh, interesting."
00:30:00,00:30:02,"I mean, arguably,"
00:30:02,00:30:03,see all those bits of paper in front of you.
00:30:03,00:30:04,We can all throw stones.
00:30:04,00:30:06,Can I read out a fact?
00:30:06,00:30:07,What? That was just about to...
00:30:07,00:30:08,I've got 20 lines up to it.
00:30:08,00:30:09,"Oh, you've got loads."
00:30:09,00:30:10,You've done loads.
00:30:10,00:30:10,You've done loads.
00:30:10,00:30:11,"Like, here's one."
00:30:11,00:30:12,Here's one from Dominic Brown.
00:30:12,00:30:12,"Oh, I don't know."
00:30:12,00:30:14,He's a pretty intense host this time.
00:30:14,00:30:15,Yeah.
00:30:15,00:30:17,It's about time someone started cracking the whip.
00:30:17,00:30:18,"No, I love this."
00:30:18,00:30:19,This is from Dominic Brown.
00:30:19,00:30:21,The US Navy has an army
00:30:21,00:30:23,which has an air force.
00:30:23,00:30:26,That's great.
00:30:26,00:30:26,I was looking this up
00:30:26,00:30:28,to try and find out a bit more about it.
00:30:28,00:30:29,It turns out that the US Army
00:30:29,00:30:30,also has its own Navy.
00:30:30,00:30:34,They've got...
00:30:34,00:30:35,I can't remember.
00:30:35,00:30:36,"It's called Army Watercraft Systems,"
00:30:36,00:30:39,and they have got 130 boats or ships
00:30:39,00:30:40,or vessels or whatever it is.
00:30:40,00:30:41,Right.
00:30:41,00:30:42,It must be quite confusing.
00:30:42,00:30:43,Yeah.
00:30:43,00:30:45,"I go in here, Chelsea Pyle."
00:30:45,00:30:46,My husband told me this.
00:30:46,00:30:47,Sounds like a very expensive house.
00:30:47,00:30:51,"My husband told me this interesting fact,"
00:30:51,00:30:52,and I found an article to explain it.
00:30:52,00:30:56,"When Mount St. Helens erupted in 1980,"
00:30:56,00:30:57,the sound of the explosion
00:30:57,00:30:59,could be heard as far away as Canada.
00:30:59,00:31:00,"So we kind of all know that, right?"
00:31:00,00:31:02,Like it sort of went...
00:31:02,00:31:02,Where's Mount St. Helens?
00:31:02,00:31:03,"Quite near Canada, right?"
00:31:03,00:31:04,Is it?
00:31:04,00:31:05,Yeah.
00:31:05,00:31:06,"I mean, it is, isn't it?"
00:31:06,00:31:07,What?
00:31:07,00:31:08,It's in the Northwest of America.
00:31:08,00:31:09,"Oh, the USA?"
00:31:09,00:31:09,Yeah.
00:31:09,00:31:10,"Oh, okay."
00:31:10,00:31:10,Okay.
00:31:10,00:31:12,It's in Washington.
00:31:12,00:31:12,Okay.
00:31:12,00:31:13,But still...
00:31:13,00:31:14,"Oh, that's next door."
00:31:14,00:31:15,"There's still a distance, though, right?"
00:31:15,00:31:16,The point of the next sentence...
00:31:16,00:31:17,Several hundred miles away
00:31:17,00:31:18,that you can hear this eruption.
00:31:18,00:31:19,"Yeah, right."
00:31:19,00:31:19,There you go.
00:31:19,00:31:20,The sound of the explosion
00:31:20,00:31:22,could be heard as far away as Canada.
00:31:22,00:31:25,"But to those closest to the epicenter,"
00:31:25,00:31:26,it made no sound at all.
00:31:26,00:31:27,"Oh, I see."
00:31:27,00:31:28,What?
00:31:28,00:31:28,Yeah.
00:31:28,00:31:29,What?
00:31:29,00:31:30,That's pretty amazing.
00:31:30,00:31:30,Is this like a trick
00:31:30,00:31:32,because they were underwater or something?
00:31:32,00:31:34,How is that possible?
00:31:34,00:31:35,"They were in a mudcrab vehicle,"
00:31:35,00:31:37,setting a world record.
00:31:37,00:31:38,Is that...
00:31:38,00:31:40,How?
00:31:40,00:31:42,Is it like being in the eye of a storm?
00:31:42,00:31:42,"I guess so, right?"
00:31:42,00:31:43,Yeah.
00:31:43,00:31:43,Oh.
00:31:43,00:31:44,It can't be currently.
00:31:44,00:31:44,"No, no, sorry."
00:31:44,00:31:45,I was just saying yes.
00:31:45,00:31:47,Is it like that?
00:31:47,00:31:49,"I wasn't saying yes, it is."
00:31:49,00:31:54,It is weird because sound...
00:31:54,00:31:57,"I don't feel like sound acts like the eye of a storm,"
00:31:57,00:31:59,"I guess, which is where it's whirling around you."
00:31:59,00:32:00,"It's not like James talks,"
00:32:00,00:32:01,"and if I'm standing right in front of him,"
00:32:01,00:32:03,"I can't hear it, but if I step to the side..."
00:32:03,00:32:06,And now James is miming at me for the distance at home.
00:32:06,00:32:07,"That's a really good visual, Ken."
00:32:07,00:32:08,Yeah.
00:32:08,00:32:08,That was great.
00:32:08,00:32:12,"If sound gets too loud,"
00:32:12,00:32:15,it creates a shockwave rather than a sound wave.
00:32:15,00:32:16,"Oh, yeah."
00:32:16,00:32:17,"Oh, is that so?"
00:32:17,00:32:18,Maybe it's that.
00:32:18,00:32:18,That's very good.
00:32:18,00:32:20,Do you not have the reason?
00:32:20,00:32:22,"No, I mean, I'm clicking the link here with my finger"
00:32:22,00:32:24,"on this bit of paper, but it's not open."
00:32:24,00:32:25,"Sorry, that's my fluff."
00:32:25,00:32:26,I should have...
00:32:26,00:32:28,"Oh, dear."
00:32:28,00:32:29,Someone else read it.
00:32:29,00:32:31,This is from Hannah Killen or Kylan?
00:32:31,00:32:32,"Kylan, I think."
00:32:32,00:32:33,"Kylan, okay."
00:32:33,00:32:35,This is from Hannah Kylan.
00:32:35,00:32:37,"During the World Wars, spies, mainly women,"
00:32:37,00:32:40,were discovered because what would have given them away?
00:32:40,00:32:42,"So they trained in language,"
00:32:42,00:32:44,they trained in culture and manner.
00:32:44,00:32:46,What would have given them away?
00:32:46,00:32:50,"Specifically, something specifically female that..."
00:32:50,00:32:52,"You know what, I thought it was going to be at first?"
00:32:52,00:32:54,There was a woman who was arrested
00:32:54,00:32:57,because they had some weird writing on their buttocks.
00:32:57,00:33:00,And what had happened was they'd sat on a train
00:33:00,00:33:02,and they were worried about the dirty seats.
00:33:02,00:33:04,So I'd put some newspaper underneath their bum
00:33:04,00:33:07,and then the print had gone onto their bum cheeks
00:33:07,00:33:09,and it had been like backwards writing.
00:33:09,00:33:10,So they didn't really know what it said.
00:33:10,00:33:12,So they assumed that she'd been dispatched into the country
00:33:12,00:33:14,with a secret message for the resistance.
00:33:14,00:33:16,Exactly. Written on her bum.
00:33:16,00:33:18,"And it just said, ""Could you smell my ass?"""
00:33:18,00:33:23,Was it they ordered pints instead?
00:33:23,00:33:26,"And in Germany, you don't order pints."
00:33:26,00:33:28,"No, I guess like famous examples are"
00:33:28,00:33:30,a spy once was outed when she was giving birth
00:33:30,00:33:33,and she started swearing in her actual name
00:33:33,00:33:34,after that kind of stuff.
00:33:34,00:33:35,"No, we talked about the spies,"
00:33:35,00:33:37,the German spies who were caught in the UK
00:33:37,00:33:39,because didn't they have a lot of...
00:33:39,00:33:40,Was it sausages in their bag or something?
00:33:40,00:33:44,And there were French spies who were given away
00:33:44,00:33:46,because they smelled of garlic or something.
00:33:46,00:33:46,Do you remember that?
00:33:46,00:33:47,"No, it's too crude."
00:33:47,00:33:49,"Yeah, there was an Australian spy"
00:33:49,00:33:51,who was throwing a boomerang.
00:33:51,00:33:54,There was a Mexican spy with a big sombrero.
00:33:54,00:33:55,It's so cute. There was one amazing story
00:33:55,00:33:57,where a guy was...
00:33:57,00:33:59,They thought he was a spy and they just couldn't get him.
00:33:59,00:34:00,"They kept trying, they're interrogating,"
00:34:00,00:34:02,doing all the tricks to get him to do.
00:34:02,00:34:03,And he was just flawless.
00:34:03,00:34:05,"And then supposedly one day when crossing a road,"
00:34:05,00:34:07,one of the people who was trying to out him
00:34:07,00:34:10,"was behind him and went, ""Watch out a car!"""
00:34:10,00:34:11,And he looked the wrong way.
00:34:11,00:34:11,Brilliant.
00:34:11,00:34:14,"And but like, you need a lot of witnesses."
00:34:14,00:34:16,"Like, how does that hold up in court?"
00:34:16,00:34:16,Yeah.
00:34:16,00:34:18,Everything else is...
00:34:18,00:34:21,"Anyway, the answer here is that they knitted wrong."
00:34:21,00:34:23,So this is from a book by Debbie Stoller
00:34:23,00:34:24,called Stitch and Bitch.
00:34:24,00:34:27,And the idea is that Americans knit
00:34:27,00:34:29,"in a very cumbersome, time-consuming way."
00:34:29,00:34:31,These are Hannah's words.
00:34:31,00:34:32,"It feels like, yes."
00:34:32,00:34:36,Where they let go of the yarn
00:34:36,00:34:37,and then loop it around the needle.
00:34:37,00:34:40,Whereas Europeans never let go of the yarn
00:34:40,00:34:41,and can make the stitches much faster.
00:34:41,00:34:44,So they would be outed for their knitting style.
00:34:44,00:34:44,Wow.
00:34:44,00:34:47,"So this is American spies in France,"
00:34:47,00:34:48,"presumably, or in Germany or whatever."
00:34:48,00:34:50,"Yeah, it's going to be interesting."
00:34:50,00:34:50,Great fact.
00:34:50,00:34:50,Yeah.
00:34:50,00:34:53,"Because in knitting, people used to knit codes"
00:34:53,00:34:54,"in various wars, didn't they?"
00:34:54,00:34:56,"Like, morse code into knitting."
00:34:56,00:34:59,You'd have specific lumps in your knitwear.
00:34:59,00:35:00,I don't know how much it was done
00:35:00,00:35:02,and how much there was a lot of fear mongering around.
00:35:02,00:35:03,Oh my God.
00:35:03,00:35:05,Is that person wearing a jumper
00:35:05,00:35:07,actually transmitting morse code to their friend?
00:35:07,00:35:09,But you could definitely knit code into stuff.
00:35:09,00:35:11,"Remember that, also, that where they used to show you"
00:35:11,00:35:12,people's heads and tattoo them?
00:35:12,00:35:13,Yes.
00:35:13,00:35:14,And then this is back in like--
00:35:14,00:35:14,I think--
00:35:14,00:35:16,"This is a revolution, so it broke me at times."
00:35:16,00:35:17,Yeah.
00:35:17,00:35:18,And the hair would grow back.
00:35:18,00:35:18,Exactly.
00:35:18,00:35:19,There's a problem with that.
00:35:19,00:35:22,And with the pregnancy one.
00:35:22,00:35:22,Yeah.
00:35:22,00:35:24,Is you have to wait quite a long time
00:35:24,00:35:26,between setting it up and getting the pay off.
00:35:26,00:35:29,The message will be out of date by the time.
00:35:29,00:35:29,You would think so.
00:35:29,00:35:30,You would think so.
00:35:30,00:35:31,"Wait, what was pregnancy one?"
00:35:31,00:35:33,"Well, like, for instance, the idea"
00:35:33,00:35:36,"that Dan mentioned, which was when a woman gives birth,"
00:35:36,00:35:37,she'll swear in her own language.
00:35:37,00:35:38,"Sorry, yes."
00:35:38,00:35:40,If you weren't sure someone was an agent
00:35:40,00:35:42,and you had to wait for them to get pregnant
00:35:42,00:35:44,and then wait nine months and then--
00:35:44,00:35:44,Yes.
00:35:44,00:35:44,Yeah.
00:35:44,00:35:45,Yeah.
00:35:45,00:35:48,And how are you going to impregnate them as well?
00:35:48,00:35:48,They're what it's not going to be.
00:35:48,00:35:49,Probably the normal way.
00:35:49,00:35:54,She got pregnant in a peculiarly British way.
00:35:54,00:36:04,All right.
00:36:04,00:36:06,This is from Jeremy Correken.
00:36:06,00:36:10,"And he says, ""My hometown, Rochester, New York,"
00:36:10,00:36:13,forgot it had a nuclear reactor.
00:36:13,00:36:16,"And it found out when they were about to tear it down."""
00:36:16,00:36:17,And--
00:36:17,00:36:19,The wrecking ball has just swung back.
00:36:19,00:36:23,I've just thought of something.
00:36:23,00:36:24,And there's more detail on this.
00:36:24,00:36:26,"And it's amazing, actually."
00:36:26,00:36:26,I'll just read it to you.
00:36:26,00:36:29,So Kodak may be a sinking ship.
00:36:29,00:36:30,Kodak the company.
00:36:30,00:36:31,"Oh, yeah."
00:36:31,00:36:33,A humorously written piece here.
00:36:33,00:36:35,But apparently it's a nuclear sinking ship
00:36:35,00:36:36,for more than 30 years.
00:36:36,00:36:39,The company kept a small reactor running in its basement
00:36:39,00:36:40,in Rochester.
00:36:40,00:36:44,And it was used for research and powered by 3.5 pounds
00:36:44,00:36:45,of uranium.
00:36:45,00:36:46,Kodak the--
00:36:46,00:36:47,I think the camera--
00:36:47,00:36:48,The camera people.
00:36:48,00:36:49,The camera people.
00:36:49,00:36:50,Had their own nuclear.
00:36:50,00:36:51,Believe so.
00:36:51,00:36:52,That's amazing.
00:36:52,00:36:54,And it's the kind they make bombs from.
00:36:54,00:36:56,Apparently--
00:36:56,00:36:56,Wow.
00:36:56,00:36:57,They took precautions.
00:36:57,00:37:00,The reactor was locked away in a concrete bunker.
00:37:00,00:37:01,It never leaks.
00:37:01,00:37:03,And I'm just going to skip through and try
00:37:03,00:37:05,to find out why Kodak would keep getting
00:37:05,00:37:05,a nuclear reactor.
00:37:05,00:37:07,Is that originally what photobombing was?
00:37:07,00:37:10,"It was much more dangerous, yeah."
00:37:10,00:37:11,So good.
00:37:11,00:37:14,"So starting decades ago, Kodak had an interest"
00:37:14,00:37:16,"in neutrons, subatomic particles that can be used"
00:37:16,00:37:19,to determine the makeup of a given material
00:37:19,00:37:22,or create an image of it without damaging it.
00:37:22,00:37:22,"Yeah, you can see that."
00:37:22,00:37:24,"OK, so you can fire neutrons at something"
00:37:24,00:37:26,and get an image of it.
00:37:26,00:37:29,"And to do that, you need to create a nuclear reactor"
00:37:29,00:37:31,"in order to generate a bunch of neutrons, I guess."
00:37:31,00:37:31,Wow.
00:37:31,00:37:32,How else are you going to do it?
00:37:32,00:37:33,That's incredible.
00:37:33,00:37:34,Can I do one?
00:37:34,00:37:34,Yeah.
00:37:34,00:37:37,"Elizabeth Royce writes, ""There's a bridge in West Virginia"
00:37:37,00:37:40,"which was only fixed after the Soviet Union intervened."""
00:37:40,00:37:43,This is great.
00:37:43,00:37:45,So I sort of looked up what was going on here
00:37:45,00:37:46,and basically it was an article about it
00:37:46,00:37:48,on the Blue Ridge Country website.
00:37:48,00:37:50,"It's called Vulcan, this place, this tiny town."
00:37:50,00:37:53,Very few people living there.
00:37:53,00:37:54,They had no safe way to drive out of town
00:37:54,00:37:57,because there was a bridge that collapsed in 1974.
00:37:57,00:37:58,The only way you could get in and out
00:37:58,00:38:01,"was to drive up the Kentucky side of the tug,"
00:38:01,00:38:02,"which I guess is the river,"
00:38:02,00:38:04,"and walk across a narrow, swinging bridge."
00:38:04,00:38:06,Children had to crawl under parked railroad cars
00:38:06,00:38:08,at the railroad's bridge to get to school.
00:38:08,00:38:10,One child lost a leg doing that.
00:38:10,00:38:13,"So just like horrible situation and, you know,"
00:38:13,00:38:14,just a nightmare.
00:38:14,00:38:15,They can't get in and out of town.
00:38:15,00:38:17,"And this guy called John Robinette,"
00:38:17,00:38:20,"who was the self-appointed mayor apparently,"
00:38:20,00:38:23,"wrote to the Soviet Embassy in 1977 in Whattington, DC,"
00:38:23,00:38:26,describing Vulcan's plight and requesting foreign aid for a bridge.
00:38:26,00:38:31,"And the Soviets dispatched a journalist who reported back saying,"
00:38:31,00:38:33,"""Yes, of course, we'll fund your bridge."
00:38:33,00:38:35,"If America can't do this, we will pay for it."""
00:38:35,00:38:36,Nice.
00:38:36,00:38:38,"Because of the PR, PR coup."
00:38:38,00:38:40,"Within hours of that journalist visiting,"
00:38:40,00:38:42,"word came down from the governor saying,"
00:38:42,00:38:44,"""Yeah, we'll build a bridge. We'll build a bridge."""
00:38:44,00:38:45,And there we go.
00:38:45,00:38:48,They kept the promise and eventually the bridge was delivered.
00:38:48,00:38:49,"According to news reports,"
00:38:49,00:38:52,Vulcan residents celebrated with illegally imported Russian vodka.
00:38:52,00:38:52,Nice.
00:38:52,00:38:53,In the American flag hung high.
00:38:53,00:38:54,That's a good story.
00:38:54,00:38:55,"Mia Tappin says,"
00:38:55,00:38:59,"""A lone word is a word borrowed from another language."
00:39:00,00:39:04,"A calque is a direct translation of one word into another language."""
00:39:04,00:39:05,See?
00:39:05,00:39:06,Subtle difference.
00:39:06,00:39:06,Remember that.
00:39:06,00:39:10,"The word calque, and bear in mind my spelling this,"
00:39:10,00:39:12,"C-A-L-Q-U-E,"
00:39:12,00:39:14,the word calque is an example of a lone word
00:39:14,00:39:16,because it comes from the French word calque.
00:39:16,00:39:19,And the word lone word is an example of a calque
00:39:19,00:39:23,"because it's directly translated from German as lane word,"
00:39:23,00:39:24,meaning lone word.
00:39:24,00:39:25,That's super.
00:39:25,00:39:26,So good.
00:39:26,00:39:26,Wow.
00:39:26,00:39:28,I love that.
00:39:28,00:39:29,"Yeah, that's amazing."
00:39:29,00:39:30,Here's a fun one.
00:39:30,00:39:31,This is from Dan Maynard.
00:39:31,00:39:33,"""Hey, I have a fun fact about Aussie Osborne."
00:39:33,00:39:35,"I tried sending it to James on Instagram,"
00:39:35,00:39:36,"but not sure if you'll see it."""
00:39:36,00:39:40,"Sorry, that's not the fact."
00:39:40,00:39:42,"I don't really know how Instagram works,"
00:39:42,00:39:43,I'll be honest.
00:39:43,00:39:43,I am on it.
00:39:43,00:39:45,No such thing as James Harkin.
00:39:45,00:39:46,He is.
00:39:46,00:39:47,"I can prove that,"
00:39:47,00:39:49,because I watch him post stuff from @shribeland.
00:39:49,00:39:51,Jesus Christ.
00:39:51,00:39:52,The self-plugging is off the chouser.
00:39:52,00:39:54,"Anna, anything you want to...?"
00:39:54,00:39:56,"I've got nothing, thanks."
00:39:56,00:39:56,"Well, Dan writes,"
00:39:56,00:39:58,"""If you don't already know the story,"
00:39:58,00:40:00,"in 1972, Black Sabbath were recording Volume 4"
00:40:00,00:40:02,in a mansion in Bel-Air.
00:40:02,00:40:04,Aussie went and adjusted the thermostat
00:40:04,00:40:05,and continued on with the day.
00:40:05,00:40:07,"Next thing, the cops turn up,"
00:40:07,00:40:08,"sirens blaring,"
00:40:08,00:40:12,and here everyone thinks it's a drug raid in the house
00:40:12,00:40:13,and proceeded to flush away
00:40:13,00:40:15,and snort as many drugs as possible.
00:40:15,00:40:17,"It turns out,"
00:40:17,00:40:19,"Aussie had not adjusted the thermostat,"
00:40:19,00:40:21,he had in fact hit the emergency call button
00:40:21,00:40:22,and alerted the local police.
00:40:22,00:40:25,And they were just there to check if everything was okay.
00:40:25,00:40:27,"We're back, we're back."
00:40:28,00:40:29,Let's get back.
00:40:29,00:40:30,"I suppose there's no crime,"
00:40:30,00:40:32,"there's no criminal offence of having taken drugs,"
00:40:32,00:40:33,even like five minutes ago.
00:40:33,00:40:35,"That's really interesting,"
00:40:35,00:40:38,"and I think no one's ever properly tried that in court,"
00:40:38,00:40:40,"because I think that is, in theory, that is true,"
00:40:40,00:40:43,but it's difficult to say that something's never been
00:40:43,00:40:44,"in your possession if you've taken it,"
00:40:44,00:40:46,especially as it's in your body.
00:40:46,00:40:47,"But if you've taken every bit of it,"
00:40:47,00:40:49,"and it's just fizzing around your nervous system,"
00:40:49,00:40:51,"is it, like, is that still possession?"
00:40:51,00:40:52,"Possession is illegal,"
00:40:52,00:40:56,"and if it's in your stomach, arguably, you're possessing it."
00:40:56,00:40:58,"And it's very difficult to say it's in my stomach,"
00:40:58,00:41:00,but at no stage did I ever possess it.
00:41:00,00:41:02,This is quite a fun one.
00:41:02,00:41:05,Chuck Norris once helped deliver a baby on a helicopter?
00:41:05,00:41:05,"No, he didn't."
00:41:05,00:41:08,This is from James Wetter.
00:41:08,00:41:10,It happened in 2013.
00:41:10,00:41:12,"There was a woman in, you know, the Ars of Silly?"
00:41:12,00:41:13,Yes.
00:41:13,00:41:14,"When you're pregnant and you're about to give birth,"
00:41:14,00:41:15,you go to the mainland.
00:41:15,00:41:15,Yeah.
00:41:15,00:41:19,But she went into labour
00:41:19,00:41:22,and then gave birth in mid-air on the helicopter.
00:41:22,00:41:23,Okay.
00:41:23,00:41:26,"And Chuck Norris happened to be on that helicopter flight,"
00:41:26,00:41:26,right?
00:41:26,00:41:30,On board the helicopter was Lieutenant Commander Chuck Norris.
00:41:30,00:41:32,He was the observer on board the helicopter.
00:41:32,00:41:33,Come on.
00:41:33,00:41:36,"And, yeah, the baby was born mid-air."
00:41:36,00:41:39,And they took off with seven passengers on board
00:41:39,00:41:40,and landed with eight.
00:41:40,00:41:41,That's so cool.
00:41:41,00:41:42,"And then in 2022, it happened again."
00:41:42,00:41:44,Chuck Norris again?
00:41:44,00:41:45,"No, don't think so."
00:41:45,00:41:46,I'm not sure.
00:41:46,00:41:49,"Here's one for you, Andy."
00:41:49,00:41:53,"If you're in a certain town in Switzerland,"
00:41:53,00:41:54,"whose name escapes me,"
00:41:55,00:42:00,"once a year, you can get a helicopter ride for six euros fifty."
00:42:00,00:42:01,Riddle me this.
00:42:01,00:42:03,Is this?
00:42:03,00:42:05,"Normally, of course, it would cost you a lot of money to get a helicopter."
00:42:05,00:42:05,"Right, okay."
00:42:05,00:42:06,"And where is this one, so?"
00:42:06,00:42:08,It's in Switzerland somewhere.
00:42:08,00:42:10,And is this for me because I'm cheap?
00:42:10,00:42:12,"No, no, it's because you like infrastructure."
00:42:12,00:42:16,"And, you know, vehicles and stuff like that."
00:42:16,00:42:17,So are you hitching a lift on?
00:42:17,00:42:18,I've given too much away.
00:42:18,00:42:21,"Are you hitching a lift because it's flying under a,"
00:42:21,00:42:24,"what do I like, a finicky, a tour finicky railway?"
00:42:24,00:42:27,It's a bane of moss and everyone's refusing to get in it.
00:42:27,00:42:28,So priceless.
00:42:28,00:42:30,Think finiculars.
00:42:30,00:42:31,That's a link here.
00:42:31,00:42:31,Okay.
00:42:31,00:42:33,"So rather than a funicular helicopter,"
00:42:33,00:42:36,whereby it's attached to a tower
00:42:36,00:42:39,and the rotors provide the power to lift it.
00:42:39,00:42:40,Brilliant.
00:42:40,00:42:41,But you're going by helicopter.
00:42:41,00:42:42,I've got it.
00:42:42,00:42:43,I think I've got it.
00:42:43,00:42:45,"Is it a, it's like a rail replacement bus service,"
00:42:45,00:42:47,except it's a finicular replacement helicopter.
00:42:47,00:42:48,Exactly.
00:42:48,00:42:50,It's now amazing.
00:42:50,00:42:52,And they're not allowed to charge more than the finicular.
00:42:52,00:42:52,Precisely.
00:42:52,00:42:57,"So once a year, they have to put the finicular into maintenance,"
00:42:57,00:42:59,but they still need to get to their village.
00:42:59,00:43:02,And so the government puts on a rail replacement helicopter.
00:43:02,00:43:04,And of course they can only charge you the amount
00:43:04,00:43:06,that you would charge if it was a train.
00:43:06,00:43:08,That is so good.
00:43:08,00:43:09,I would just wait at the bottom.
00:43:09,00:43:09,"No, thank you."
00:43:09,00:43:10,I don't need to get home.
00:43:10,00:43:12,I'll just wait for the finicular to be back in service.
00:43:12,00:43:18,There's a fact I said ages ago.
00:43:18,00:43:20,"And when I say fact, it's something I said out loud"
00:43:20,00:43:22,that I'd love to confirm.
00:43:22,00:43:23,And I still haven't confirmed it.
00:43:23,00:43:24,"And I promise I've been looking, which"
00:43:24,00:43:26,"is that there was a story that Chuck Norris,"
00:43:26,00:43:28,"the actual Chuck Norris actor, as opposed"
00:43:28,00:43:32,"to the helicopter pilot, all of his movies are arguably,"
00:43:32,00:43:34,"I think, a bit B movie-ish, not very good."
00:43:34,00:43:36,"You'd watch it for the fighting, right?"
00:43:36,00:43:37,He's got kids.
00:43:37,00:43:39,"He doesn't want his kids to watch his movies,"
00:43:39,00:43:40,because it has fighting.
00:43:40,00:43:43,"So the story is, is that Chuck Norris edits out"
00:43:43,00:43:45,"the fighting scenes from his movies,"
00:43:45,00:43:49,and then lets his kids just watch the shitty experiments.
00:43:49,00:43:50,That's the whole movie.
00:43:50,00:43:51,That's so funny.
00:43:51,00:43:52,Chuck Norris.
00:43:52,00:43:53,"But I read it in an interview with him once,"
00:43:53,00:43:55,and I can't find it anywhere.
00:43:55,00:43:55,So I'm still looking.
00:43:55,00:43:56,I'm still on the hunt.
00:43:56,00:43:57,Wow.
00:43:57,00:43:58,That's a great fact.
00:43:58,00:44:01,This is a good one from Dylan Difford.
00:44:01,00:44:06,"In May 2005, the British Department of Trade and Industry"
00:44:06,00:44:09,"was briefly renamed the Department of Productivity, Energy"
00:44:09,00:44:10,and Industry.
00:44:10,00:44:12,But the name was reverted after one week
00:44:12,00:44:15,"when it was suggested that this made Minister Alan Johnson,"
00:44:15,00:44:18,"if you remember him, the Productivity, Energy,"
00:44:18,00:44:20,"and Industry Secretary, or Penis."
00:44:21,00:44:26,I can't imagine Mr. Johnson had any problem with that.
00:44:26,00:44:27,"Oh, well indeed he did."
00:44:27,00:44:28,Very good.
00:44:28,00:44:32,I think this is the shortest one we've got from Stuart Marsh.
00:44:32,00:44:34,The company that makes square fire extinguishers
00:44:34,00:44:35,is called Oval.
00:44:35,00:44:39,What?
00:44:39,00:44:42,I've never seen a square fire extinguisher.
00:44:42,00:44:44,"I think I looked it up when that fact came into the inbox,"
00:44:44,00:44:45,and it's--
00:44:45,00:44:46,What an odd thing to have.
00:44:46,00:44:47,They're real.
00:44:47,00:44:47,They are real.
00:44:47,00:44:48,That's amazing.
00:44:48,00:44:49,Do we know why?
00:44:49,00:44:51,"OK, here's an idea."
00:44:51,00:44:54,"You put them on a ship, and then they won't roll away."
00:44:54,00:44:55,Yeah.
00:44:55,00:44:56,Brilliant.
00:44:56,00:44:56,Very good.
00:44:56,00:44:58,Safe all over.
00:44:58,00:44:58,Yeah.
00:44:58,00:44:58,Nice.
00:44:58,00:45:01,And that is the only reason I can possibly take off for a--
00:45:01,00:45:04,Easier to stack in the warehouse.
00:45:04,00:45:05,Yeah.
00:45:05,00:45:09,If I was shopping for a square fire extinguisher
00:45:09,00:45:11,"and I was a ship captain, I wouldn't open up the website"
00:45:11,00:45:15,that was OvalExtinguishers.com.
00:45:15,00:45:18,"This is from Amy Apple, and apparently was also sent in"
00:45:18,00:45:19,by John Turbow.
00:45:19,00:45:20,Yeah.
00:45:20,00:45:25,And Turbow was my nickname when I was younger.
00:45:25,00:45:25,It was.
00:45:25,00:45:28,"And John's your brother's name, so is there some sort of--"
00:45:28,00:45:31,"The fact is that a few years ago,"
00:45:31,00:45:34,"Nicholas Fazel, a biology that University of Lausanne"
00:45:34,00:45:38,in Switzerland and his colleagues developed a fascination
00:45:38,00:45:40,"with the penises of seratine bats,"
00:45:40,00:45:42,which is a species found in woodlands and the attics
00:45:42,00:45:43,of old buildings.
00:45:43,00:45:47,Seratine bats sport abnormally long penises
00:45:47,00:45:49,with wide heart-shaped heads.
00:45:49,00:45:52,"When erect, the members are around seven times longer"
00:45:52,00:45:54,"than the female's vagina, and their bulbous heads"
00:45:54,00:45:57,are seven times wider than the vaginal opening.
00:45:57,00:45:59,"Oh, it's a lot of detail, isn't it?"
00:45:59,00:46:03,"Anyway, Fazel wondered, as you would, how does this work?"
00:46:03,00:46:05,How can they use that for copulation?
00:46:05,00:46:06,"Long and short of it, as it were."
00:46:06,00:46:08,The long and wide--
00:46:08,00:46:11,"Basically, they hang upside down."
00:46:11,00:46:13,The male climbs onto the female's back
00:46:13,00:46:15,"and gets her neck, as bats do."
00:46:15,00:46:18,But then he uses his erect penis
00:46:18,00:46:21,"to push the female's tail membrane to the side,"
00:46:21,00:46:24,"locates her vulva, and then he just puts his penis"
00:46:24,00:46:28,"on her vagina, and copulates there."
00:46:28,00:46:29,So it's more of a--
00:46:29,00:46:30,It's more like a cloacal kiss.
00:46:30,00:46:33,"It's a cloacal kiss, yes."
00:46:33,00:46:34,It's a nice way of putting it.
00:46:34,00:46:37,"God, they do have massive penises, bats."
00:46:37,00:46:37,Do you remember I got--
00:46:37,00:46:39,Do you not remember?
00:46:39,00:46:42,"I showed you a photo, and I got sent a picture"
00:46:42,00:46:44,by Colonel John Blastridge Snell
00:46:44,00:46:45,when he was out on his expedition.
00:46:45,00:46:47,"So look at this big bat, and I opened it."
00:46:47,00:46:51,It was a bat that strung up with this giant floppy penis.
00:46:51,00:46:52,It was huge.
00:46:52,00:46:53,It was huge.
00:46:53,00:46:54,Wow.
00:46:54,00:46:54,I'm still--
00:46:54,00:46:57,It's still burnt in my memory as a terrifying image.
00:46:57,00:46:58,"Holy dick pic, that's bad."
00:46:58,00:47:09,"Okay, that's it."
00:47:09,00:47:10,That's all of your facts.
