 "Ofuro mo makashimasu"

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.840
 Hello and welcome to No Such Thing as a Fish, a weekly podcast coming to you from the QI

00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:21.120
 offices in Hoban. My name is Andrew Hunter Murray, I'm joined by James Harkin, Dan Treiber

00:00:21.120 --> 00:00:28.560
 and Anna Tadzinski, and this is an upside-down Christmasy end of year-y episode, Lord of

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:38.160
 Mistrule style. I'm in charge. The lunatics have taken over the asylum. Exactly that, and instead of

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:45.440
 us telling you our facts, you are going to be telling us your facts. No, we will be telling

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:51.280
 you your facts. That's it. We will be telling each other your facts, but you are allowed to listen.

00:00:53.760 --> 00:01:00.240
 You're welcome. Basically, we have the email address, podcast@QI.com, people write in with all

00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:04.000
 sorts of stuff, and if you remember Clubfish, you'll hear every month the kind of things people

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:08.240
 write in with them, one of our bonus episodes, but also you send in a huge number of brilliant

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:13.440
 extra facts. So we have just gathered around here, we have a massive pile of different facts from

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:17.120
 all of you, some of the absolute best ones that have been sent in over the last year or two.

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:20.400
 You know, because we can all dip into the inbox, we might have seen a couple of them,

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:24.480
 a lot of them we'll have never seen before. Yeah, so would someone like to begin?

00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:28.800
 I got the facts here. Yeah, go on. All right, this is from Haley Dargan. It says,

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:34.720
 "A team in Darwin, Australia, drove a car named Mudcrab, seven kilometers underwater across the

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:40.160
 harbour. They got bogged down nearly a dozen times and dealt with the threat of crocodiles.

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:44.720
 In doing this, they broke two world records, longest underwater drive and the deepest

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:50.080
 underwater drive." Wow. Pretty cool. I didn't, sorry, it's a cut wall kind of car?

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:55.200
 It's called the Mudcrab and it's, I guess, amphibious and... Drive sideways. Yep.

00:01:55.200 --> 00:02:02.560
 That's cool that it can drive underwater. Very much don't try this with your own car,

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:08.080
 warning, right? Yeah, this is, I bet there's a few alterations they've made to their regular car.

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:14.400
 There's an old, I think it's a Mitch Hedberg joke. There's something like that,

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:20.160
 which I will absolutely butcher, but it's something like, "I went on a date with a girl.

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:25.200
 It didn't go very well. She was annoyed that I didn't open the doors for her and rather I swam

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:35.200
 straight to the surface." That's a very good joke. That story reminds me of that story we had in

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:39.440
 one of our books of the year, our books we did about the news of the year. If you want to catch

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:44.880
 up on the news of 2018, why don't you go to Amazon and buy it? But one of the stories was about

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:50.080
 those two Australian women, I think this is right, who were following their sat-nav and just,

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:53.520
 it was somewhere in Australia and they just followed their sat-nav into the ocean.

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:58.240
 Just because the sat-nav had messed up and they just went, "Must be right, must be right."

00:02:58.240 --> 00:03:02.880
 It's amazing. And their car got stranded in the sea. Do you remember, we mentioned on the podcast,

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:07.200
 there was a president who had an amphibious car and he used to take, so it wasn't at the White House.

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:11.360
 It was Johnson. It was Johnson, that's right. And he would take his friends out in the car

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:14.640
 and they would go a bit down a hill where there was a lake at the bottom and then he would fake

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:18.400
 losing control. "Oh God, oh God, what is that?" And then they would go in the lake, but they'd

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:25.200
 obviously drive on. Very, very cool. If there's ever a weird wacky thing a president did fact,

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:29.360
 it's always LBJ, isn't it? It's amazing how time to lose the war in Vietnam.

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:34.720
 You lose the war in Vietnam, yeah, is where I was going. It's amazing. In the last decade or so,

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:42.160
 we've had such straight down the line presidents happily buttoned up, you know. In the Addo National

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:47.680
 Park in South Africa, if you're driving along there, dung beetles have the right of way.

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:52.080
 So if you're driving along and a dung beetle crosses the road, you have to just sit there

00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:56.160
 and wait for it. "How good is everyone's eyesight in this area? Sorry, that's incredible."

00:03:56.160 --> 00:04:00.880
 They are small, but they do push large bowls of dung. "That's a good point. Yeah, fair enough."

00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:04.000
 And there must be a lot of traffic jams with a lot of cars stopping. Is that,

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:07.040
 "Can you get out of the car and check?" No, just a normal beetle, okay, get back in.

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:14.400
 Or a normal poo, yeah. Just a poo in the middle. I'm sure I can't see the beetle, but it must be

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:18.800
 there. Pretty sure it's not moving. That would be breakups. You would hear breakups there. It was

00:04:18.800 --> 00:04:23.600
 like, "Why'd they leave you? Why'd your boyfriend leave you?" He waited five hours, five hours,

00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:28.640
 because there was a random piece of poo sitting on the road. If you do go driving in any of these

00:04:28.640 --> 00:04:34.240
 places like I drove in Yellowstone, I think in a few other places like that, you do have a lot

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:40.000
 of traffic jams, because as soon as there's an animal there, everyone stops and you just kind

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:44.640
 of sat there at the back. And the first two or three people can all see the animal, but of course,

00:04:44.640 --> 00:04:48.800
 then it wanders off and they drive off and everyone else who's in the traffic jam never gets to see it.

00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:53.280
 And the elves. The elves of Iceland we've spoken about before. Oh yeah. Well, they believe a lot

00:04:53.280 --> 00:04:57.040
 of people in Iceland believe there are elves and they believe they live in rocks. And so if a rock

00:04:57.040 --> 00:05:01.840
 finds its way into the middle of the road and it's a believed home of an elf, you can't move the

00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:05.840
 rock, you have to drive around literally maybe going off-road in order to get around it until

00:05:05.840 --> 00:05:09.840
 it's removed safely by the proper authority. Anyway, look guys, I'm sorry, we're moving on to the next

00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:16.400
 fact. Oh, this is actually a bit of an audience feedback one. It's from Dave Clemer. We mentioned

00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:23.040
 the Treaty of Versailles and the rights to champagne or naming champagne. Oh yeah. So Dave said,

00:05:23.040 --> 00:05:26.480
 "I didn't know about that, but it was not shocking given the presence of two other items I knew about

00:05:26.480 --> 00:05:30.880
 with the extreme military significance in the Treaty of Versailles. One of them was the patent

00:05:30.880 --> 00:05:37.040
 on aspirin, which Bayer, the German pharmaceutical firm, was required to give up. The second is the

00:05:37.040 --> 00:05:43.440
 concert pitch for orchestras being standardised such that the A above middle C is 435 Hertz.

00:05:43.440 --> 00:05:48.240
 That was in the Treaty of Versailles. I think this is on QI this year, isn't it?

00:05:48.240 --> 00:05:52.720
 Amazing. That's incredible. It might be on your TV in about 18 months' time.

00:05:52.720 --> 00:05:58.320
 But yeah, the British used to tune their instruments to a different...

00:05:58.320 --> 00:06:00.880
 Actually, everyone came to the British way, did they? I can't remember.

00:06:00.880 --> 00:06:02.480
 I can't remember. Because they won the First World War.

00:06:02.480 --> 00:06:05.040
 I can't remember. It was so good. That was what really upset the Germans.

00:06:05.040 --> 00:06:08.560
 This is actually the platform on which Hitler built his rise to power, was that?

00:06:08.560 --> 00:06:14.480
 Frequency things. 30 years of Hertz was the slogan he wrote, wasn't it? Thank you.

00:06:14.480 --> 00:06:20.800
 Just a quick fact about that. So if you play, I can play the trumpet, for instance, and when you

00:06:20.800 --> 00:06:26.240
 tune to the orchestra, you play a B-flat because everyone plays whatever their

00:06:27.440 --> 00:06:31.440
 notes is tuned to, and then it all comes together, and you can hear if you're slightly flat or

00:06:31.440 --> 00:06:35.680
 slightly sharp. But B-flat is also the way you tune a Vuvuzela.

00:06:35.680 --> 00:06:43.360
 How many orchestras? I think there is one Vuvuzela concerto that someone wrote once.

00:06:43.360 --> 00:06:48.080
 That's incredible. That's so good. That's the sad thing, isn't it?

00:06:48.080 --> 00:06:53.360
 So few professional Vuvuzelists get a chance. I wonder when, last time,

00:06:53.360 --> 00:06:56.560
 officially, an instrument's been allowed into the main orchestra posse.

00:06:56.560 --> 00:07:00.160
 It's interesting. That's a good point. One of the sort of later,

00:07:00.160 --> 00:07:03.840
 weird brass instruments, you know? Like, weirder than a French horn.

00:07:03.840 --> 00:07:09.200
 You'll see a theremin often. But that's not part of a classical orchestra.

00:07:09.200 --> 00:07:11.440
 Yeah, that's quite neat. That's a great point.

00:07:11.440 --> 00:07:16.320
 I remember seeing, I watched a piece once. I can't remember who it was by, shame on me,

00:07:16.320 --> 00:07:20.480
 but there was a part for cutlery. Lovely.

00:07:20.480 --> 00:07:24.880
 So the percussionist had a load of cutlery there and they would either rattle it,

00:07:24.880 --> 00:07:28.560
 or they would drop it, or whatever. Was it a tuning fork? Brilliant.

00:07:28.560 --> 00:07:30.400
 There we go. There we go. If you're on fire today.

00:07:30.400 --> 00:07:32.560
 That's another one. Come on.

00:07:32.560 --> 00:07:37.120
 All right, here we go. This is from Tom Whitfield.

00:07:37.120 --> 00:07:43.840
 "The world record for highest jump into water is held by Rick Charles at 172 feet."

00:07:43.840 --> 00:07:49.600
 Can I ask, was that how high the water was, or how high he was before he got in the water?

00:07:50.560 --> 00:07:53.120
 How would highest jump into water?

00:07:53.120 --> 00:07:56.800
 I just thought it might be someone like, for instance, I've been to Lake Titicaca,

00:07:56.800 --> 00:07:59.600
 which is the highest navigational lake in the world.

00:07:59.600 --> 00:08:00.160
 Right.

00:08:00.160 --> 00:08:02.000
 If I jumped into Lake Titicaca, I'd like to...

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:02.960
 You've broken this record.

00:08:02.960 --> 00:08:05.840
 I can see what he was saying. Sorry.

00:08:05.840 --> 00:08:07.920
 It's just a fun bit of whimsy from James, though.

00:08:07.920 --> 00:08:11.440
 No, I love a fun bit of whimsy. You know me. I get comedy.

00:08:11.440 --> 00:08:14.080
 I just sometimes like it to be expanded on a little bit.

00:08:14.080 --> 00:08:17.200
 So, sorry, that's 20 feet higher than the Statue of Liberty.

00:08:17.200 --> 00:08:21.120
 An air had to be pumped into the pool to break the surface tension.

00:08:21.120 --> 00:08:23.120
 Otherwise, he would have gone splat.

00:08:23.120 --> 00:08:24.240
 That's amazing.

00:08:24.240 --> 00:08:27.280
 I think it's in the '70s or so, because there's footage of it.

00:08:27.280 --> 00:08:30.000
 So, I follow the YouTube link that Tom put in the email.

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:32.960
 It's unbelievable, because he's basically on a ladder,

00:08:32.960 --> 00:08:34.400
 which is taller than the Statue of Liberty.

00:08:34.400 --> 00:08:36.720
 You just see so far up.

00:08:36.720 --> 00:08:38.000
 That's hard to get up the ladder.

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:39.600
 I was impressed that he got up the ladder at all.

00:08:39.600 --> 00:08:40.560
 I mean, it's stunning.

00:08:40.560 --> 00:08:43.680
 We're on the second floor of this building, and I struggled most weeks.

00:08:45.040 --> 00:08:48.160
 What's interesting is someone very, very recently,

00:08:48.160 --> 00:08:51.840
 and I've heard the term "the highest jump into a body of water ever,"

00:08:51.840 --> 00:08:54.240
 broke the record just a few days ago.

00:08:54.240 --> 00:08:56.960
 So, maybe this is an old email, and possibly it was right at the time.

00:08:56.960 --> 00:08:59.200
 And he doesn't have water.

00:08:59.200 --> 00:09:00.560
 It's incredible. You see the footage.

00:09:00.560 --> 00:09:03.200
 He's standing on the edge of a cliff, and he throws something.

00:09:03.200 --> 00:09:03.920
 I don't know what it was.

00:09:03.920 --> 00:09:06.000
 It looks like a giant fish, but I don't think it is.

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:08.560
 Into the water, and as soon as it hits and breaks this tension,

00:09:08.560 --> 00:09:11.360
 he jumps and goes in, and it's the new world record.

00:09:11.360 --> 00:09:12.400
 Oh, really?

00:09:12.400 --> 00:09:14.400
 Okay, well, it must be my turn to read the facts.

00:09:14.400 --> 00:09:15.840
 I'll take the one closest to me.

00:09:15.840 --> 00:09:20.080
 This is from Sam Kavayaro.

00:09:20.080 --> 00:09:23.760
 And Sam says, "I was reading an article about the early human species

00:09:23.760 --> 00:09:26.000
 that coexisted with Homo sapiens,

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:29.200
 and they mentioned the estimates of how many Neanderthals were alive

00:09:29.200 --> 00:09:31.600
 at any one time, giving an upper limit,

00:09:31.600 --> 00:09:35.360
 and my brain immediately decided to find a relatable reference scale

00:09:35.360 --> 00:09:38.960
 and came up with a nearby city that had similar population."

00:09:38.960 --> 00:09:40.560
 So, I thought you might not have a sense

00:09:40.560 --> 00:09:43.200
 of what the population of Olympia, Washington is.

00:09:43.200 --> 00:09:43.520
 Correct.

00:09:44.160 --> 00:09:46.400
 Absolutely zero reference for that.

00:09:46.400 --> 00:09:48.560
 I think that's the capital of Washington, isn't it, Olympia?

00:09:48.560 --> 00:09:50.160
 I don't even know whether that's true or not.

00:09:50.160 --> 00:09:51.120
 I simply have not...

00:09:51.120 --> 00:09:53.040
 I had not heard of Olympia, Washington before now.

00:09:53.040 --> 00:09:54.320
 It's not the biggest.

00:09:54.320 --> 00:09:55.280
 It's not Seattle.

00:09:55.280 --> 00:09:58.560
 So, I looked up a UK comparison.

00:09:58.560 --> 00:10:00.880
 "At the estimated most populous,

00:10:00.880 --> 00:10:04.720
 there were as many Neanderthals as modern humans living in Torquay."

00:10:04.720 --> 00:10:09.840
 That would be an excellent episode of Faulty Towers.

00:10:09.840 --> 00:10:11.200
 That's great.

00:10:11.200 --> 00:10:12.320
 Wait, how many was it?

00:10:12.320 --> 00:10:13.040
 52,000.

00:10:13.040 --> 00:10:14.160
 52,000, yeah.

00:10:14.160 --> 00:10:15.920
 That is unbelievable.

00:10:15.920 --> 00:10:16.720
 Yeah, that's...

00:10:16.720 --> 00:10:17.280
 Wow.

00:10:17.280 --> 00:10:19.520
 Actually, that would be a cool premise for something.

00:10:19.520 --> 00:10:20.640
 Like, the Neanderthals are here.

00:10:20.640 --> 00:10:22.960
 They all live in Torquay, and it's about the...

00:10:22.960 --> 00:10:24.160
 Modern-day Torquay.

00:10:24.160 --> 00:10:24.800
 Yeah, yeah.

00:10:24.800 --> 00:10:28.000
 And it's just like the amusing cultural clashes that you get.

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:32.640
 Do they remove all of the current population of Torquay

00:10:32.640 --> 00:10:34.880
 so the population stays at 52,000,

00:10:34.880 --> 00:10:37.760
 or does the population balloon to 104,000?

00:10:37.760 --> 00:10:41.440
 I think everyone in Torquay is sort of bought out of their homes,

00:10:41.440 --> 00:10:43.840
 and it's like, we need to house exactly this number of people,

00:10:43.840 --> 00:10:45.200
 so where can we put them up?

00:10:45.200 --> 00:10:46.400
 You all go to Exeter.

00:10:46.400 --> 00:10:48.320
 Exactly that.

00:10:48.320 --> 00:10:49.040
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:10:49.040 --> 00:10:49.600
 Wow.

00:10:49.600 --> 00:10:50.080
 Yeah.

00:10:50.080 --> 00:10:53.200
 So, yeah, there were also 1,000 more Neanderthals in the world

00:10:53.200 --> 00:10:56.480
 at their peak than there are currently inhabitants

00:10:56.480 --> 00:10:57.680
 of the county of Rutland.

00:10:57.680 --> 00:10:59.680
 Very nice.

00:10:59.680 --> 00:11:02.480
 So, I mean, I reckon that I have more knowledge

00:11:02.480 --> 00:11:04.640
 about the city of Olympia in Washington

00:11:04.640 --> 00:11:06.560
 than I do about the county of Rutland.

00:11:06.560 --> 00:11:08.160
 I've had my notes the smallest county.

00:11:08.160 --> 00:11:09.200
 I live very near it,

00:11:09.200 --> 00:11:12.240
 and I can tell you the difference between the people there

00:11:12.240 --> 00:11:12.960
 and Neanderthals.

00:11:12.960 --> 00:11:13.760
 Right.

00:11:13.760 --> 00:11:15.120
 Oh, there we go.

00:11:15.120 --> 00:11:15.600
 Ouch.

00:11:15.600 --> 00:11:16.640
 That's a good slagic.

00:11:16.640 --> 00:11:19.760
 Rutland used to be a proper county,

00:11:19.760 --> 00:11:22.080
 and I believe it's now a unitary authority.

00:11:22.080 --> 00:11:23.360
 So, much like the Neanderthal,

00:11:23.360 --> 00:11:25.600
 it's actually sort of faded into the past.

00:11:25.600 --> 00:11:25.920
 Wow.

00:11:25.920 --> 00:11:26.240
 Really?

00:11:26.240 --> 00:11:27.040
 The county of Rutland, yes.

00:11:27.040 --> 00:11:28.480
 I thought it was still a county.

00:11:28.480 --> 00:11:30.400
 Actually, interesting, the people of Rutland

00:11:30.400 --> 00:11:34.560
 do bury their dead with flowers and trinkets,

00:11:34.560 --> 00:11:38.560
 and a rumoured to have mastered fire.

00:11:38.560 --> 00:11:39.440
 Wow.

00:11:39.440 --> 00:11:41.200
 And actually, if you get yourself tested,

00:11:41.200 --> 00:11:42.000
 you are often,

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:44.320
 you are between one and three percent Rutland.

00:11:44.320 --> 00:11:49.200
 But I've got another one here from David Saunders.

00:11:49.200 --> 00:11:52.160
 The British basketball league is having to change its name

00:11:52.160 --> 00:11:54.000
 as no one can Google it,

00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:56.160
 because the acronym is shared with a surgical procedure

00:11:56.160 --> 00:11:57.840
 that's become very popular in recent years.

00:11:57.840 --> 00:11:59.840
 Our Brazilian butt lift.

00:11:59.840 --> 00:12:03.360
 That's brilliant.

00:12:03.360 --> 00:12:05.600
 The league's new logo looks more like it's advertising

00:12:05.600 --> 00:12:07.360
 the surgery than the basketball.

00:12:07.920 --> 00:12:08.480
 It's true.

00:12:08.480 --> 00:12:09.920
 I've seen the new logo and it's a big,

00:12:09.920 --> 00:12:11.200
 it's a big Bulbas B.

00:12:11.200 --> 00:12:11.920
 I'll put it that way.

00:12:11.920 --> 00:12:13.280
 It does.

00:12:13.280 --> 00:12:15.040
 It looks a bit like in Bambus.

00:12:15.040 --> 00:12:16.240
 How interesting.

00:12:16.240 --> 00:12:16.800
 It's been lifted.

00:12:16.800 --> 00:12:18.880
 That's cool.

00:12:18.880 --> 00:12:20.960
 Do you think having a big Brazilian butt

00:12:20.960 --> 00:12:22.480
 would help you in the basketball?

00:12:22.480 --> 00:12:23.200
 Unquestionably.

00:12:23.200 --> 00:12:23.600
 I don't know.

00:12:23.600 --> 00:12:24.240
 Of course.

00:12:24.240 --> 00:12:25.280
 If you've got me there, yeah.

00:12:25.280 --> 00:12:27.520
 You're space-hoppering your way along the court on that thing?

00:12:27.520 --> 00:12:28.080
 Yeah.

00:12:28.080 --> 00:12:30.560
 You don't bounce on your arse in basketball.

00:12:30.560 --> 00:12:32.240
 I think that's a travel violation, yeah.

00:12:32.240 --> 00:12:37.520
 But do you think like if Kobe Bryant

00:12:37.520 --> 00:12:39.680
 was jumping and doing a basket,

00:12:39.680 --> 00:12:41.040
 he might say to someone,

00:12:41.040 --> 00:12:42.400
 "Can you smell my arse?"

00:12:42.400 --> 00:12:44.400
 That was a thing, right?

00:12:44.400 --> 00:12:46.000
 That was a, yeah, yeah.

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:47.520
 Just tell me how my arse tastes.

00:12:47.520 --> 00:12:53.680
 Grandad cried.

00:12:53.680 --> 00:12:59.840
 Because you're up your bum to the other guy's face, right?

00:12:59.840 --> 00:13:01.520
 I was thinking, yeah.

00:13:01.520 --> 00:13:02.160
 What was the story?

00:13:02.160 --> 00:13:04.000
 It was like Shaquille O'Neal and Ed.

00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:04.960
 Yeah, okay, be right.

00:13:04.960 --> 00:13:07.280
 That's like, I just had such a flashback

00:13:07.280 --> 00:13:08.080
 to when I was a kid.

00:13:08.080 --> 00:13:09.520
 You know, when you used to get so embarrassed,

00:13:09.520 --> 00:13:11.440
 your mum's singing along the really wrong words

00:13:11.440 --> 00:13:12.400
 to modern songs.

00:13:12.400 --> 00:13:15.520
 And I just felt that shiver hearing you say that.

00:13:15.520 --> 00:13:16.240
 You know what?

00:13:16.240 --> 00:13:18.400
 It was in the same episode that we mentioned that

00:13:18.400 --> 00:13:20.560
 as the darts, players,

00:13:20.560 --> 00:13:22.800
 where one of them farted and put the other one up.

00:13:22.800 --> 00:13:23.280
 Oh, yeah.

00:13:23.280 --> 00:13:24.640
 So that's why I'm conflating.

00:13:24.640 --> 00:13:25.200
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:13:25.200 --> 00:13:25.840
 See?

00:13:25.840 --> 00:13:27.680
 I think that's a good, I think that's...

00:13:27.680 --> 00:13:29.520
 Don't listen to these guys, James.

00:13:29.520 --> 00:13:32.000
 I think that's a really good, like,

00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:34.320
 punk line for you in whatever sport you are.

00:13:34.320 --> 00:13:36.640
 Okay, smell my arse.

00:13:36.640 --> 00:13:37.200
 That's my arse.

00:13:37.200 --> 00:13:40.080
 When I'm playing Scrabble over Christmas,

00:13:40.080 --> 00:13:43.120
 I got to say it to my hitmoss.

00:13:43.120 --> 00:13:45.120
 He has smelled my arse.

00:13:45.120 --> 00:13:49.280
 Oh, my God.

00:13:49.280 --> 00:13:49.920
 Brilliant.

00:13:49.920 --> 00:13:56.480
 Here's one.

00:13:56.480 --> 00:13:58.240
 Ludwig Umeyer.

00:13:58.240 --> 00:13:59.840
 In Cuban and other cigar factories,

00:13:59.840 --> 00:14:02.000
 it used to be common to have a person to read aloud

00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:04.000
 to the cigar rollers while they worked.

00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:04.640
 Oh, yes.

00:14:04.640 --> 00:14:06.640
 And the Monte Cristo cigar brand got its name

00:14:06.640 --> 00:14:08.080
 because the Count of Monte Cristo

00:14:08.080 --> 00:14:09.280
 was an extremely popular choice

00:14:09.280 --> 00:14:10.800
 for the workers to listen to.

00:14:10.800 --> 00:14:11.200
 That's incredible.

00:14:11.200 --> 00:14:12.080
 That's interesting.

00:14:12.080 --> 00:14:13.680
 I heard the story one, I think.

00:14:13.680 --> 00:14:14.000
 Yeah.

00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:15.760
 I think we told that on the show at one point.

00:14:15.760 --> 00:14:16.240
 Oh, did we?

00:14:16.240 --> 00:14:16.960
 Sorry, okay.

00:14:16.960 --> 00:14:18.320
 Yeah, but that's a great extra detail.

00:14:18.320 --> 00:14:20.240
 Yeah, that's the bit that I think is amazing,

00:14:20.240 --> 00:14:21.440
 really, the Monte Cristo bit.

00:14:21.440 --> 00:14:22.320
 It's such a long bit.

00:14:22.320 --> 00:14:22.800
 It is long, yeah.

00:14:22.800 --> 00:14:24.880
 You could watch Sony Cigar as well listening to that.

00:14:24.880 --> 00:14:26.400
 It's long but quite exciting.

00:14:26.400 --> 00:14:29.680
 And also, it's not very, I would say...

00:14:29.680 --> 00:14:31.440
 You don't really need to remember what happened at the start,

00:14:31.440 --> 00:14:33.120
 so you could, like, swoop in and swoop out a bit,

00:14:33.120 --> 00:14:34.960
 because it's just him and his adventures, isn't it?

00:14:34.960 --> 00:14:36.160
 It almost feels like the second half

00:14:36.160 --> 00:14:36.960
 is a bit like a comic book.

00:14:36.960 --> 00:14:38.960
 There's, like, a 300-page digression in Paris

00:14:38.960 --> 00:14:39.760
 in the middle bit.

00:14:39.760 --> 00:14:40.960
 Yeah, I know, but that's...

00:14:40.960 --> 00:14:42.240
 But you don't need to know what's happened before.

00:14:42.240 --> 00:14:43.280
 It's just, like, there's this rich dude

00:14:43.280 --> 00:14:44.880
 having a bloody whale of a time.

00:14:44.880 --> 00:14:45.680
 Yeah.

00:14:45.680 --> 00:14:49.760
 On Cuba, Fidel Castro once ate 18 bowls of ice cream

00:14:49.760 --> 00:14:50.720
 in a single sitting.

00:14:50.720 --> 00:14:52.240
 Okay.

00:14:52.240 --> 00:14:53.280
 Yeah, he just liked ice cream.

00:14:53.280 --> 00:14:55.040
 As like, oh, that wasn't a challenge.

00:14:55.040 --> 00:14:55.760
 It wasn't a challenge.

00:14:55.760 --> 00:14:56.880
 He really liked ice cream.

00:14:56.880 --> 00:14:58.720
 There was a big thing in Cuba,

00:14:58.720 --> 00:14:59.840
 which we might have mentioned before,

00:14:59.840 --> 00:15:01.360
 about milk and stuff like that,

00:15:01.360 --> 00:15:04.960
 and being able to feed the country with amazing cows

00:15:04.960 --> 00:15:05.840
 and stuff like that.

00:15:05.840 --> 00:15:08.880
 So it was partly an advertising thing

00:15:08.880 --> 00:15:10.000
 about how great our milk is,

00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:12.320
 but it was also partly he just loved ice cream.

00:15:12.320 --> 00:15:12.880
 Right.

00:15:12.880 --> 00:15:13.520
 His sister died this year.

00:15:13.520 --> 00:15:14.480
 His sister passed away.

00:15:14.480 --> 00:15:15.040
 Yeah.

00:15:15.040 --> 00:15:15.440
 Really?

00:15:15.440 --> 00:15:15.840
 Yeah.

00:15:15.840 --> 00:15:18.000
 She was a double agent, basically.

00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:20.080
 She, to begin with, loved Castro,

00:15:20.080 --> 00:15:22.320
 and then when he took over,

00:15:22.320 --> 00:15:24.400
 and then he continued to sort of go in a direction

00:15:24.400 --> 00:15:25.600
 that was bad, she went,

00:15:25.600 --> 00:15:26.880
 hang on a second, I thought you were going to be good

00:15:26.880 --> 00:15:28.240
 when you got into power, and he wasn't.

00:15:28.240 --> 00:15:29.600
 And so she left Cuba.

00:15:29.600 --> 00:15:30.800
 I can't remember where she went.

00:15:30.800 --> 00:15:32.320
 And, yeah, he became a spy,

00:15:32.320 --> 00:15:34.960
 and was really a big part in his downfall.

00:15:34.960 --> 00:15:35.920
 Sorry he didn't have a downfall.

00:15:35.920 --> 00:15:36.560
 He...

00:15:36.560 --> 00:15:37.360
 Sorry, sorry.

00:15:37.360 --> 00:15:38.080
 Sorry, sorry.

00:15:38.080 --> 00:15:40.080
 He basically outlasted 10 U.S. presidents.

00:15:40.080 --> 00:15:40.880
 Sorry.

00:15:40.880 --> 00:15:44.000
 Like, she was the worst spy ever.

00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:47.520
 I guess that's where the double agent bit comes in.

00:15:47.520 --> 00:15:49.200
 She's actually doing a four keeper.

00:15:49.200 --> 00:15:51.920
 Yeah, I'll make sure I bring him down.

00:15:51.920 --> 00:15:53.360
 Next week, honestly, he's coming down.

00:15:53.360 --> 00:15:57.120
 One of the first facts I remember discovering for QI

00:15:57.120 --> 00:15:59.760
 was in a cigar magazine about Kennedy

00:15:59.760 --> 00:16:01.360
 when he placed the embargo on Cuba.

00:16:01.360 --> 00:16:04.080
 His last move before that was to order

00:16:04.080 --> 00:16:06.320
 a couple of suitcases of Cuban cigars, wasn't it?

00:16:06.320 --> 00:16:07.920
 Well, he would have them sent over to him,

00:16:07.920 --> 00:16:10.000
 and then the gates came down.

00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:12.880
 I love though that they would discover that fact in Cuba

00:16:12.880 --> 00:16:15.840
 while someone's reading out a biography of JFK

00:16:15.840 --> 00:16:17.440
 as part of the Rolex system.

00:16:17.440 --> 00:16:17.760
 Yes.

00:16:17.760 --> 00:16:18.400
 He did what?

00:16:18.400 --> 00:16:20.160
 The factory workers.

00:16:20.160 --> 00:16:22.240
 Shall I take another?

00:16:22.240 --> 00:16:22.640
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:16:22.640 --> 00:16:23.440
 Back to from the middle.

00:16:23.440 --> 00:16:25.200
 Okay, again, this is the closest to me.

00:16:25.200 --> 00:16:26.720
 So, Rebecca from Ottawa.

00:16:27.680 --> 00:16:30.160
 I think not the band, probably the province.

00:16:30.160 --> 00:16:32.080
 We'll find out, I guess.

00:16:32.080 --> 00:16:35.120
 What did Ottawa sing?

00:16:35.120 --> 00:16:35.680
 Final Count?

00:16:35.680 --> 00:16:36.640
 No, not the Final Count.

00:16:36.640 --> 00:16:38.480
 That's something really famous, they say.

00:16:38.480 --> 00:16:39.360
 Sorry, I don't know.

00:16:39.360 --> 00:16:41.440
 Final Countdown was when they called Europe.

00:16:41.440 --> 00:16:42.800
 Yeah, Ottawa.

00:16:42.800 --> 00:16:45.440
 Ottawa, not Ottawa.

00:16:45.440 --> 00:16:47.040
 They did D-I-S-C-O.

00:16:47.040 --> 00:16:48.640
 Oh, that's a big story.

00:16:48.640 --> 00:16:49.920
 D-I-S-C-O.

00:16:49.920 --> 00:16:51.440
 But unfortunately, slightly different names.

00:16:51.440 --> 00:16:52.800
 So, Brenda's that whole bit.

00:16:52.800 --> 00:16:57.440
 So, Rebecca, who is a person who lives in Ottawa,

00:16:57.440 --> 00:16:58.640
 an Ottawa, you might say.

00:16:58.640 --> 00:17:01.840
 Right, say that.

00:17:01.840 --> 00:17:03.040
 Do you think there's a shop in Ottawa?

00:17:03.040 --> 00:17:05.200
 Ottawa and Ottomans.

00:17:05.200 --> 00:17:06.400
 Like a furniture shop.

00:17:06.400 --> 00:17:06.720
 Yeah.

00:17:06.720 --> 00:17:07.680
 There should be, shouldn't there?

00:17:07.680 --> 00:17:08.560
 There should be, yeah.

00:17:08.560 --> 00:17:11.760
 Ottawa, Rebecca, writes,

00:17:11.760 --> 00:17:15.120
 "Thought you might enjoy this new story from Canada

00:17:15.120 --> 00:17:16.160
 about a sad goat."

00:17:16.160 --> 00:17:18.960
 She goes on to put the headline,

00:17:18.960 --> 00:17:22.320
 which is "Mysterious Screams on BC Island,"

00:17:22.320 --> 00:17:24.080
 British Columbia, I imagine.

00:17:24.080 --> 00:17:26.560
 "Turn out to be from a sad goat,

00:17:26.560 --> 00:17:28.560
 Royal Canadian Mounted Police say."

00:17:28.560 --> 00:17:32.560
 And yeah, there was basically a lot of sounds

00:17:32.560 --> 00:17:36.160
 in the bottom of a ravine in British Columbia,

00:17:36.160 --> 00:17:38.000
 in Quadra Island.

00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:41.120
 And the Mounties say it didn't come from a person in distress,

00:17:41.120 --> 00:17:42.800
 but rather a sad goat.

00:17:42.800 --> 00:17:44.400
 It sounded apparently a bit like,

00:17:44.400 --> 00:17:45.600
 "Help! Help!"

00:17:45.600 --> 00:17:49.040
 Oh, that was great.

00:17:49.040 --> 00:17:50.960
 Do we know why the goat was so sad?

00:17:50.960 --> 00:17:51.200
 Yes.

00:17:51.200 --> 00:17:54.720
 We, the momma goat's babies had been removed

00:17:54.720 --> 00:17:56.000
 and she was calling for them.

00:17:56.080 --> 00:17:56.640
 Oh.

00:17:56.640 --> 00:17:57.280
 Been removed.

00:17:57.280 --> 00:17:57.920
 That is sad.

00:17:57.920 --> 00:17:59.600
 That has taken a sad turn.

00:17:59.600 --> 00:17:59.760
 Yeah.

00:17:59.760 --> 00:18:01.920
 I'm now, yeah, I'm now siding with her on the dinner.

00:18:01.920 --> 00:18:04.080
 Could have been just removed temporarily

00:18:04.080 --> 00:18:05.120
 to go to nursery.

00:18:05.120 --> 00:18:06.720
 Yes.

00:18:06.720 --> 00:18:08.160
 Do you think, do you think that's what it was?

00:18:08.160 --> 00:18:11.040
 It's hard to sell.

00:18:11.040 --> 00:18:14.800
 Thankfully, officers confirmed all was well

00:18:14.800 --> 00:18:16.720
 and nobody, besides the momma goats,

00:18:16.720 --> 00:18:18.080
 was in any kind of distress.

00:18:18.080 --> 00:18:19.680
 Huh.

00:18:19.680 --> 00:18:21.040
 Poor old, poor old momma goat.

00:18:21.040 --> 00:18:22.240
 Don't know how much we did enjoy that.

00:18:22.240 --> 00:18:24.240
 Should be looking around at everyone's faces.

00:18:24.720 --> 00:18:25.120
 Yeah.

00:18:25.120 --> 00:18:27.680
 It is de-distressing.

00:18:27.680 --> 00:18:28.400
 It was I...

00:18:28.400 --> 00:18:30.800
 Okay, never mind.

00:18:30.800 --> 00:18:32.080
 It was nice idea for a joke.

00:18:32.080 --> 00:18:36.480
 I got one here, which is from Ivor Cardus.

00:18:36.480 --> 00:18:39.440
 And it's from chapter five of A Very British Murder

00:18:39.440 --> 00:18:40.560
 by Lucy Walsley.

00:18:40.560 --> 00:18:43.040
 And so this is an extract, I think word for word.

00:18:43.040 --> 00:18:44.320
 "During the First World War,

00:18:44.320 --> 00:18:47.440
 trainee soldiers were frequently set the initiative test

00:18:47.440 --> 00:18:48.640
 of hiding and spending the night

00:18:48.640 --> 00:18:50.800
 in Madame Tussaud's Chamber of Horrors.

00:18:50.800 --> 00:18:52.000
 This caused such inconvenience

00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:53.840
 that Madame Tussauds was forced officially

00:18:53.840 --> 00:18:55.840
 to ask the War Office to stop the practice."

00:18:55.840 --> 00:19:00.480
 How many soldiers would fit in Madame Tussaud's Chamber of Horrors

00:19:00.480 --> 00:19:02.400
 before it became unmanageably...

00:19:02.400 --> 00:19:02.720
 Yeah.

00:19:02.720 --> 00:19:04.560
 Like, poor it's just a military training ground at that point.

00:19:04.560 --> 00:19:05.600
 What is the Chamber of Horrors?

00:19:05.600 --> 00:19:06.960
 Is it one room? Is it a whole building?

00:19:06.960 --> 00:19:10.000
 No, it's a sort of labyrinthine basement

00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:12.000
 full of, you know, spooky people...

00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:13.520
 It's relatively small, though.

00:19:13.520 --> 00:19:14.400
 It's tight, isn't it?

00:19:14.400 --> 00:19:15.040
 The corridors.

00:19:15.040 --> 00:19:16.160
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:19:16.160 --> 00:19:18.160
 People jump out at you, people grab you.

00:19:18.160 --> 00:19:20.240
 Yeah, I actually really don't like those

00:19:20.240 --> 00:19:22.480
 when actors are jumping out at you.

00:19:22.480 --> 00:19:24.640
 I get why people do, but I just find them really teased.

00:19:24.640 --> 00:19:26.080
 But you love horror films.

00:19:26.080 --> 00:19:26.720
 Yeah.

00:19:26.720 --> 00:19:28.480
 But it's like a live horror film, isn't it?

00:19:28.480 --> 00:19:30.800
 It's not really, it's just people trying to scare you.

00:19:30.800 --> 00:19:34.160
 That actually, now you say it, that is quite like a horror film.

00:19:34.160 --> 00:19:38.800
 I don't like it because I find both of them equally scary, you know?

00:19:38.800 --> 00:19:40.880
 I don't like ghost rides, all things like that,

00:19:40.880 --> 00:19:43.200
 because I have such high hopes and they're always disappointed

00:19:43.200 --> 00:19:44.480
 because they're never scary enough.

00:19:44.480 --> 00:19:47.040
 Except the ghost ride at Alton Towers.

00:19:47.040 --> 00:19:48.640
 I'm absolutely terrified in all of them.

00:19:48.640 --> 00:19:51.040
 I'm shouting to the people behind me in the ghost train.

00:19:51.040 --> 00:19:52.400
 Can you smell my ass?

00:19:52.400 --> 00:19:53.440
 You know, I'm really.

00:19:53.440 --> 00:19:59.840
 In the after World War One,

00:19:59.840 --> 00:20:02.000
 K-World War Two,

00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:06.080
 in World War Two, would Kitchener have been a...

00:20:06.080 --> 00:20:07.200
 No, not Kitchener.

00:20:07.200 --> 00:20:07.920
 Who was it?

00:20:07.920 --> 00:20:08.640
 An American.

00:20:08.640 --> 00:20:09.440
 Who's an American?

00:20:09.440 --> 00:20:11.040
 General?

00:20:11.040 --> 00:20:11.440
 General.

00:20:11.440 --> 00:20:12.000
 Patrick?

00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:12.720
 Eisenhower?

00:20:12.720 --> 00:20:14.160
 I can't remember who it was.

00:20:14.160 --> 00:20:15.200
 Might have begun with K.

00:20:15.200 --> 00:20:18.320
 Anyway, an American goes back to France

00:20:18.320 --> 00:20:22.400
 and he sees that there's a war grave

00:20:22.400 --> 00:20:25.280
 that the locals have been looking after for years and years and years.

00:20:25.280 --> 00:20:29.440
 And what he doesn't have the guts to tell them

00:20:29.440 --> 00:20:30.960
 is actually they'd mistaken it.

00:20:30.960 --> 00:20:33.040
 It wasn't a war grave, it was a toilet.

00:20:33.040 --> 00:20:37.200
 And they'd had this kind of like latrine,

00:20:37.200 --> 00:20:39.200
 which all the soldiers had used.

00:20:39.200 --> 00:20:41.840
 And they'd put something on there to kind of say,

00:20:41.840 --> 00:20:43.040
 "This is the latrine."

00:20:43.040 --> 00:20:44.960
 And the locals, when they came back,

00:20:44.960 --> 00:20:46.320
 saw it and thought it was a grave.

00:20:46.320 --> 00:20:46.800
 No.

00:20:46.800 --> 00:20:49.360
 And for 25 years, they were putting flowers down.

00:20:49.360 --> 00:20:50.400
 Oh, England.

00:20:50.400 --> 00:20:51.120
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:20:51.120 --> 00:20:53.840
 But like, did they put a headstone down to mark the latrine?

00:20:53.840 --> 00:20:56.320
 Because that would be a weird thing to do for one thing.

00:20:56.320 --> 00:20:57.040
 It wasn't that.

00:20:57.040 --> 00:21:00.080
 It was more like, you know, you put a stick with some flowers.

00:21:00.080 --> 00:21:01.920
 So the people would know that it was a latrine.

00:21:01.920 --> 00:21:02.720
 Oh, no.

00:21:02.720 --> 00:21:04.880
 And it was in, whoever it was,

00:21:04.880 --> 00:21:07.920
 it was in his memoirs that he went back there 25 years later,

00:21:07.920 --> 00:21:08.800
 and this is what they would do.

00:21:08.800 --> 00:21:10.400
 Why did he go back to the toilet?

00:21:10.400 --> 00:21:16.240
 I want to have one final poo to remind me of the good old days.

00:21:16.240 --> 00:21:18.560
 Back to the area where he was stationed.

00:21:18.560 --> 00:21:22.320
 What's awful is that if you squatted and took a poo there,

00:21:22.320 --> 00:21:24.560
 you'd probably be arrested for desecration.

00:21:24.560 --> 00:21:24.960
 Yes.

00:21:24.960 --> 00:21:25.760
 Such a holy mo-

00:21:25.760 --> 00:21:27.680
 And yet, you're the only one doing the right thing.

00:21:27.680 --> 00:21:28.160
 Yes.

00:21:28.160 --> 00:21:30.480
 We shout as they dragged you away in chains.

00:21:30.480 --> 00:21:31.280
 Yeah.

00:21:31.280 --> 00:21:31.920
 That's a great story.

00:21:31.920 --> 00:21:32.160
 Oh, yeah.

00:21:32.160 --> 00:21:32.880
 Hannah, you go.

00:21:32.880 --> 00:21:35.120
 Here's one from Matilda H.

00:21:35.120 --> 00:21:39.360
 In 2018, Ikea released an advert designed to be urinated on.

00:21:39.360 --> 00:21:41.280
 I think we might have said this.

00:21:41.280 --> 00:21:42.080
 Yes, I remember this.

00:21:42.080 --> 00:21:42.800
 We did do this.

00:21:42.800 --> 00:21:44.400
 It was a pregnancy test.

00:21:44.400 --> 00:21:45.760
 It was.

00:21:45.760 --> 00:21:46.480
 Yes.

00:21:46.480 --> 00:21:48.400
 And it got you a discount on...

00:21:48.400 --> 00:21:50.560
 Your baby.

00:21:50.560 --> 00:21:53.120
 Give you a free baby.

00:21:53.120 --> 00:21:54.880
 You got a crib discount on the crib.

00:21:54.880 --> 00:21:56.080
 Yes, it's baby furniture.

00:21:56.080 --> 00:21:58.640
 But I mean, not how much furniture baby needs to be on the crib,

00:21:58.640 --> 00:21:58.960
 does it?

00:21:58.960 --> 00:22:00.480
 They don't need a writing desk or a...

00:22:00.480 --> 00:22:03.680
 A baby shays long.

00:22:03.680 --> 00:22:05.360
 Shays short, yeah.

00:22:05.360 --> 00:22:10.080
 Yeah, it said a positive pregnancy reading

00:22:10.080 --> 00:22:12.480
 would get you a discount of 50%.

00:22:12.480 --> 00:22:13.600
 And according to the agency,

00:22:13.600 --> 00:22:15.440
 getting the technological aspect of the ad

00:22:15.440 --> 00:22:16.720
 took some work.

00:22:16.720 --> 00:22:19.120
 However, they quote in the email,

00:22:19.120 --> 00:22:22.000
 "The pregnancy test strip was used as a starting point."

00:22:22.000 --> 00:22:22.640
 Makes sense.

00:22:22.640 --> 00:22:25.040
 "Which relies on antibodies that bind to the pregnancy hormone,

00:22:25.040 --> 00:22:26.960
 HTG, resulting in the color change."

00:22:26.960 --> 00:22:30.000
 And did you have to take along the now quite urinary magazine

00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:30.800
 or whatever it was?

00:22:30.800 --> 00:22:32.080
 Yeah, I don't know.

00:22:32.080 --> 00:22:34.080
 Were they waterproof posters that they put up?

00:22:34.080 --> 00:22:35.120
 I guess you did.

00:22:35.120 --> 00:22:36.000
 But it's not a poster.

00:22:36.000 --> 00:22:38.560
 You can't have people going around peeing on the posters.

00:22:38.560 --> 00:22:39.680
 Just as releasing an advert.

00:22:39.680 --> 00:22:40.160
 Don't know what form came in.

00:22:40.160 --> 00:22:41.680
 Yeah, doesn't say capable of the TV.

00:22:41.840 --> 00:22:47.120
 People are trying to get a pissy tally.

00:22:47.120 --> 00:22:51.280
 So many people were electrocuted by this campaign.

00:22:51.280 --> 00:22:52.160
 They had to end it.

00:22:52.160 --> 00:22:52.800
 Oh, that's great.

00:22:52.800 --> 00:22:53.440
 That's a great fact.

00:22:53.440 --> 00:22:54.000
 Here's a good one.

00:22:54.000 --> 00:22:55.440
 I guess this is from Hailey Inslee.

00:22:55.440 --> 00:22:57.920
 Mass produced tomatoes in cans.

00:22:57.920 --> 00:22:59.600
 We're all familiar with those.

00:22:59.600 --> 00:23:02.640
 Oh, their existence to Galapagos tortoises.

00:23:02.640 --> 00:23:04.640
 Is it a riddle me this?

00:23:04.640 --> 00:23:06.080
 Yeah, that is a riddle me this, isn't it?

00:23:06.080 --> 00:23:06.640
 What is it?

00:23:06.640 --> 00:23:07.760
 Would you like to have a riddle?

00:23:07.760 --> 00:23:09.200
 Is there any chance we can get it?

00:23:09.200 --> 00:23:09.520
 No.

00:23:10.080 --> 00:23:13.440
 So, famously on the beagle,

00:23:13.440 --> 00:23:17.200
 all the giant tortoises that were brought back were eaten as food, right?

00:23:17.200 --> 00:23:19.600
 So, you've got a giant turtle that's been eaten,

00:23:19.600 --> 00:23:22.320
 but you've not got the turtle, but you've got the shell.

00:23:22.320 --> 00:23:26.160
 Is it possible that any of the fruit and veg that was on the boat

00:23:26.160 --> 00:23:29.840
 was then stored inside the empty shells?

00:23:29.840 --> 00:23:29.840
 Really?

00:23:29.840 --> 00:23:32.480
 And it kind of kept them fresh enough that they thought,

00:23:32.480 --> 00:23:33.440
 oh, we should be storing it.

00:23:33.440 --> 00:23:34.000
 That is really good.

00:23:34.000 --> 00:23:34.720
 That's really good.

00:23:34.720 --> 00:23:35.600
 That's very plausible.

00:23:35.600 --> 00:23:37.920
 Can I have another guess, assuming that that's not right?

00:23:37.920 --> 00:23:37.920
 Yeah.

00:23:38.960 --> 00:23:42.080
 Tomatoes you get in a tin are a very special species

00:23:42.080 --> 00:23:43.360
 that are not the normal tomatoes you get,

00:23:43.360 --> 00:23:45.280
 because they work better in tins.

00:23:45.280 --> 00:23:50.400
 And these species of tomatoes where the seeds went through a turtle

00:23:50.400 --> 00:23:53.200
 and in the turtle's poo and grew out of turtle poo.

00:23:53.200 --> 00:23:53.760
 Very good.

00:23:53.760 --> 00:23:55.680
 Do you know James is actually closest here?

00:23:55.680 --> 00:23:56.000
 Oh, wow.

00:23:56.000 --> 00:23:58.080
 I'm going to give James the point, because that's...

00:23:58.080 --> 00:23:59.360
 So, okay, I'll tell you what it is.

00:23:59.360 --> 00:24:00.560
 It's sort of a bit like that.

00:24:00.560 --> 00:24:02.560
 Okay, when you pick a...

00:24:02.560 --> 00:24:04.400
 Oh, and you should all have been saying tortoises throughout.

00:24:04.400 --> 00:24:07.440
 Sorry, I'll take another point.

00:24:07.440 --> 00:24:11.280
 When you pick a tomato, that short section of stem that comes with it,

00:24:11.280 --> 00:24:14.880
 you know, that little spidery bit, is the callix.

00:24:14.880 --> 00:24:17.120
 And there's a tiny bit of stem breaking off from a joint

00:24:17.120 --> 00:24:18.480
 which is called the pedicel, right?

00:24:18.480 --> 00:24:20.800
 So for many years, these sharp stubs meant you couldn't put them

00:24:20.800 --> 00:24:22.800
 into automatic harvesting bins,

00:24:22.800 --> 00:24:25.280
 because you'd end up with sharp stubs in the can, right?

00:24:25.280 --> 00:24:29.600
 But an American botanist called Charles Rick, two first names,

00:24:29.600 --> 00:24:32.960
 discovered a tomato plant with jointless pedicels,

00:24:32.960 --> 00:24:35.200
 but he couldn't get them to germinate.

00:24:35.200 --> 00:24:39.120
 The only solution he found as a last ditch was to feed the seeds to some tortoises.

00:24:39.120 --> 00:24:41.120
 The seeds then germinated quickly.

00:24:41.120 --> 00:24:42.080
 He bred from them.

00:24:42.080 --> 00:24:42.960
 Within a couple of years,

00:24:42.960 --> 00:24:45.520
 all mass-produced tinted tomatoes could be machine harvested.

00:24:45.520 --> 00:24:46.560
 - Wow! - So I think...

00:24:46.560 --> 00:24:49.680
 - James is amazing. - But also, Charles Rick,

00:24:49.680 --> 00:24:51.440
 what amazing lateral thinking going...

00:24:51.440 --> 00:24:54.800
 The only way I can do this is to feed it through an animal.

00:24:54.800 --> 00:24:57.120
 He must have tried various different things,

00:24:57.120 --> 00:24:58.960
 even different animals before then, I would think.

00:24:58.960 --> 00:25:00.320
 Yeah, that's incredible.

00:25:00.320 --> 00:25:01.280
 No, you're right.

00:25:01.280 --> 00:25:03.520
 I got one here from Jeff Houghton.

00:25:03.520 --> 00:25:06.080
 Check out a guy by the name of Francis Wharton,

00:25:06.080 --> 00:25:09.040
 a backwards man, I think, British Columbia, who in the...

00:25:09.040 --> 00:25:09.680
 A backwards...

00:25:09.680 --> 00:25:11.840
 Backwards, rather than backwards, right?

00:25:11.840 --> 00:25:13.600
 From the backwards, not...

00:25:13.600 --> 00:25:14.720
 He's a backwards man.

00:25:14.720 --> 00:25:15.520
 Yeah.

00:25:15.520 --> 00:25:18.720
 British Columbia, who in the 1960s shot a deer,

00:25:18.720 --> 00:25:21.600
 used its teeth to make his own dentures,

00:25:21.600 --> 00:25:24.880
 then used them to eat the deer with its own teeth.

00:25:24.880 --> 00:25:26.960
 - Wow! - Blimey.

00:25:26.960 --> 00:25:28.880
 That's incredible, if true.

00:25:28.880 --> 00:25:29.600
 I've got a question.

00:25:29.600 --> 00:25:30.000
 Yeah.

00:25:30.000 --> 00:25:31.840
 Do deer have canine teeth?

00:25:31.840 --> 00:25:33.040
 You wouldn't have thought so, would you?

00:25:33.040 --> 00:25:34.640
 I would have thought they're mostly molar-based

00:25:34.640 --> 00:25:35.840
 for all the plants they eat.

00:25:35.840 --> 00:25:38.080
 - Yeah. - You wouldn't want to eat sort of live prey.

00:25:38.080 --> 00:25:39.520
 But you can sharpen, right?

00:25:39.520 --> 00:25:41.040
 Presumably, that's what he was doing.

00:25:41.040 --> 00:25:42.400
 He probably shaved them to size.

00:25:42.400 --> 00:25:42.800
 Yeah.

00:25:42.800 --> 00:25:45.120
 Which animal's teeth would you most like to have in your mouth?

00:25:45.120 --> 00:25:45.840
 What a great question.

00:25:45.840 --> 00:25:49.360
 Well, what about the sheep's head fish

00:25:49.360 --> 00:25:50.240
 that we mentioned the other day,

00:25:50.240 --> 00:25:52.640
 which has the teeth of human teeth?

00:25:52.640 --> 00:25:53.760
 I wouldn't want those.

00:25:53.760 --> 00:25:54.320
 I would want...

00:25:54.320 --> 00:25:54.960
 Okay, wow.

00:25:54.960 --> 00:25:57.120
 I mean, shark's teeth, where they grow on a conveyor belt.

00:25:57.120 --> 00:25:58.320
 Sorry, just on Anna's point.

00:25:58.320 --> 00:25:59.680
 I guess the question is,

00:25:59.680 --> 00:26:02.480
 are you doing it to improve yourself,

00:26:02.480 --> 00:26:05.360
 or has some evil demon come to you saying,

00:26:05.360 --> 00:26:07.280
 "You must have another animal's teeth,"

00:26:07.280 --> 00:26:10.160
 in which case, Anna's idea is quite clever,

00:26:10.160 --> 00:26:10.560
 because you're like,

00:26:10.560 --> 00:26:12.960
 "Well, basically, I'm just getting human teeth back."

00:26:12.960 --> 00:26:14.080
 You're tricking the demon, though.

00:26:14.080 --> 00:26:14.320
 Yeah.

00:26:14.320 --> 00:26:15.200
 I think the demon will say,

00:26:15.200 --> 00:26:17.040
 "And it can't be the sheep's head fish."

00:26:17.040 --> 00:26:18.880
 It's a nice try.

00:26:18.880 --> 00:26:19.360
 Yeah.

00:26:19.360 --> 00:26:20.640
 That wasn't in the contract.

00:26:20.640 --> 00:26:22.560
 I want...

00:26:22.560 --> 00:26:25.280
 You know how blue whales have that sort of...

00:26:25.280 --> 00:26:26.000
 Baleen.

00:26:26.000 --> 00:26:26.400
 Yeah.

00:26:26.400 --> 00:26:26.880
 No, no.

00:26:26.880 --> 00:26:28.160
 There's huge plates of...

00:26:28.160 --> 00:26:29.360
 Where you...

00:26:29.360 --> 00:26:30.080
 Baleen.

00:26:30.080 --> 00:26:30.720
 Baleen.

00:26:30.720 --> 00:26:31.520
 Yeah.

00:26:31.520 --> 00:26:33.680
 The system whereby that you can only get krill through.

00:26:33.680 --> 00:26:34.720
 Yeah, because it's called baleen.

00:26:34.720 --> 00:26:35.040
 Yeah.

00:26:35.040 --> 00:26:35.600
 There we go.

00:26:35.600 --> 00:26:35.920
 I don't...

00:26:35.920 --> 00:26:37.600
 I don't baleen.

00:26:37.600 --> 00:26:38.160
 Oh!

00:26:38.160 --> 00:26:38.880
 What's that?

00:26:38.880 --> 00:26:40.480
 It's what blue whales have.

00:26:40.480 --> 00:26:42.240
 That's a nice idea.

00:26:42.240 --> 00:26:42.400
 Yeah.

00:26:42.400 --> 00:26:44.160
 So then every meal, every dinner party I go to,

00:26:44.160 --> 00:26:46.240
 it's like, "Oh, the guy who can only eat krills coming."

00:26:46.240 --> 00:26:46.560
 We've got to...

00:26:46.560 --> 00:26:50.000
 Kate, hundreds of thousands of krill food.

00:26:50.000 --> 00:26:52.720
 Got one vegetarian, one vegan, and the krill guys,

00:26:52.720 --> 00:26:54.240
 and there's nothing that'll please all of them.

00:26:54.240 --> 00:26:57.920
 Guys, Dan, I've just realized,

00:26:57.920 --> 00:26:59.360
 I don't think you have any canines.

00:26:59.360 --> 00:27:00.400
 Oh.

00:27:00.400 --> 00:27:01.120
 Really?

00:27:01.120 --> 00:27:02.240
 Holy moly.

00:27:02.240 --> 00:27:02.640
 Look at that.

00:27:02.640 --> 00:27:03.360
 Holy moly.

00:27:03.360 --> 00:27:07.600
 So normally you've got two in the middle,

00:27:07.600 --> 00:27:09.520
 two on the sides, then two canines, right?

00:27:09.520 --> 00:27:11.440
 Where are your third teeth out?

00:27:11.440 --> 00:27:12.640
 They're completely flat.

00:27:12.640 --> 00:27:13.840
 Dan, whoa.

00:27:13.840 --> 00:27:16.000
 You're the newly evolved human,

00:27:16.000 --> 00:27:17.520
 because we don't need our canines anymore,

00:27:17.520 --> 00:27:18.720
 because we have cutlery.

00:27:18.720 --> 00:27:19.520
 So well done.

00:27:19.520 --> 00:27:21.840
 Hang on, I find it really hard to bite things these days.

00:27:21.840 --> 00:27:23.760
 Yeah, you can see Anna's canine's right there.

00:27:23.760 --> 00:27:25.760
 No, honestly, this is incredible.

00:27:25.760 --> 00:27:27.920
 So, you know, when you go to the pub and you buy a pack of crisps,

00:27:27.920 --> 00:27:30.160
 and often you want to open it up so that everyone can eat it,

00:27:30.160 --> 00:27:31.280
 you might bite into it.

00:27:31.280 --> 00:27:32.400
 For years I could do that,

00:27:32.400 --> 00:27:34.880
 and then suddenly, five years ago, I can't bite.

00:27:34.880 --> 00:27:35.120
 I can't get through.

00:27:35.120 --> 00:27:36.880
 Someone's come and shaved your teeth in the night.

00:27:36.880 --> 00:27:38.160
 Holy moly.

00:27:38.160 --> 00:27:40.160
 Well, there you go.

00:27:40.160 --> 00:27:41.840
 We've learned an interesting fact today,

00:27:41.840 --> 00:27:46.560
 and here's another one from Jeff Partica,

00:27:46.560 --> 00:27:48.800
 who opens with an admission.

00:27:48.800 --> 00:27:51.280
 He says, "I may have a fact-sharing problem.

00:27:51.280 --> 00:27:52.400
 Thanks for letting us know,

00:27:52.400 --> 00:27:54.720
 but I'd be remiss if I didn't share at least one.

00:27:54.720 --> 00:27:56.160
 I myself do not hunt,

00:27:56.160 --> 00:27:58.480
 with this fact being one good reason.

00:27:58.480 --> 00:27:59.520
 In any given year,

00:27:59.520 --> 00:28:02.400
 Michigan, Wisconsin, Minnesota, and Pennsylvania

00:28:02.400 --> 00:28:06.160
 combine to issue over 2.5 million deer hunting licenses,

00:28:06.160 --> 00:28:07.760
 which, if an organized group,

00:28:07.760 --> 00:28:10.480
 would be the largest standing army in the world."

00:28:10.480 --> 00:28:13.840
 Knowing some hunters, though,

00:28:13.840 --> 00:28:17.360
 generally speaking, organized would not be the word I do for them.

00:28:17.360 --> 00:28:21.840
 Isn't that the idea of Americans being able to bear arms?

00:28:21.840 --> 00:28:22.480
 Certainly is.

00:28:22.480 --> 00:28:24.240
 In case the government goes rogue,

00:28:24.240 --> 00:28:26.960
 there is automatically a standing army there.

00:28:26.960 --> 00:28:27.280
 Right.

00:28:27.280 --> 00:28:28.880
 I think that's one of the arguments.

00:28:28.880 --> 00:28:29.840
 Yeah, yeah.

00:28:29.840 --> 00:28:32.720
 Or in case the deer finally get their act together

00:28:32.720 --> 00:28:34.000
 and rub out on mass.

00:28:34.000 --> 00:28:34.560
 Yeah, yeah.

00:28:34.560 --> 00:28:35.920
 Claim back their teeth.

00:28:35.920 --> 00:28:36.800
 I haven't done one for a while.

00:28:36.800 --> 00:28:37.280
 Yeah, go for it.

00:28:37.280 --> 00:28:37.280
 Go for it.

00:28:37.280 --> 00:28:37.920
 Can I read this?

00:28:37.920 --> 00:28:41.600
 This is from Noa de Koening from the Netherlands.

00:28:41.600 --> 00:28:44.320
 "Today I found out that the timer on your washing machine

00:28:44.320 --> 00:28:47.200
 doesn't just feel wrong, it often is.

00:28:47.200 --> 00:28:50.640
 The timer on your washing machine is an estimation

00:28:50.640 --> 00:28:52.640
 based on the weight of your laundry

00:28:52.640 --> 00:28:55.120
 or, inverted commas, load sense,

00:28:55.120 --> 00:28:57.680
 and it adjusts itself as it goes."

00:28:57.680 --> 00:28:58.640
 That's incredible.

00:28:58.640 --> 00:28:59.760
 Oh, my God.

00:28:59.760 --> 00:29:00.720
 Is it Noa?

00:29:00.720 --> 00:29:01.040
 Yeah, no.

00:29:01.040 --> 00:29:04.240
 Noa, you've saved the world for the second time today,

00:29:04.240 --> 00:29:06.240
 because that is...

00:29:06.240 --> 00:29:08.320
 My mind is blown.

00:29:08.320 --> 00:29:10.320
 I've wandered this for years, haven't we all?

00:29:10.320 --> 00:29:12.000
 Because how often have we looked

00:29:12.000 --> 00:29:14.000
 at the last minutes of the washing machine,

00:29:14.000 --> 00:29:15.040
 especially when you're desperate,

00:29:15.040 --> 00:29:15.920
 it's just before you go to bed

00:29:15.920 --> 00:29:17.280
 and you're desperate to take it out?

00:29:17.280 --> 00:29:19.200
 And apparently, because I did see this one,

00:29:19.200 --> 00:29:19.920
 I looked into it,

00:29:19.920 --> 00:29:22.720
 the last minutes are specifically the ones

00:29:22.720 --> 00:29:24.480
 where the timing messes up quite a lot.

00:29:24.480 --> 00:29:26.160
 Is it because there's less water,

00:29:26.160 --> 00:29:27.680
 so they're less heavy, maybe?

00:29:27.680 --> 00:29:30.080
 It's because the cycle...

00:29:30.080 --> 00:29:31.680
 What's happening in the cycle in the last minutes

00:29:31.680 --> 00:29:33.040
 is they're spinning it around,

00:29:33.040 --> 00:29:34.560
 so it's to do with water.

00:29:34.560 --> 00:29:37.040
 It's trying to shed the excess water.

00:29:37.040 --> 00:29:39.200
 So, depending on the density of your wash,

00:29:39.200 --> 00:29:41.120
 the water can be much greater

00:29:41.120 --> 00:29:43.200
 than the washing machine has estimated at the end.

00:29:43.200 --> 00:29:44.960
 So, yes, it'll spin for longer and longer,

00:29:44.960 --> 00:29:46.480
 and that's why they're agonizing.

00:29:46.480 --> 00:29:47.520
 When you go in eight minutes,

00:29:47.520 --> 00:29:48.480
 you go in eight minutes later,

00:29:48.480 --> 00:29:49.760
 it's seven minutes, whatever,

00:29:49.760 --> 00:29:50.800
 it's really annoying.

00:29:50.800 --> 00:29:51.520
 That's a great fact.

00:29:51.520 --> 00:29:52.080
 Thank you, Noa.

00:29:52.080 --> 00:29:52.960
 Incredible.

00:29:52.960 --> 00:29:54.560
 Can we just say, Dan has lined up

00:29:54.560 --> 00:29:55.840
 loads of facts before him.

00:29:55.840 --> 00:29:56.800
 Like, he's sort of doing

00:29:56.800 --> 00:29:58.320
 monopoly money collection over here.

00:29:58.320 --> 00:29:59.840
 No, they just happen to be facing me.

00:29:59.840 --> 00:30:00.640
 Oh, interesting.

00:30:00.640 --> 00:30:02.000
 I mean, arguably,

00:30:02.000 --> 00:30:03.440
 see all those bits of paper in front of you.

00:30:03.440 --> 00:30:04.400
 We can all throw stones.

00:30:04.400 --> 00:30:06.640
 Can I read out a fact?

00:30:06.640 --> 00:30:07.680
 What? That was just about to...

00:30:07.680 --> 00:30:08.880
 I've got 20 lines up to it.

00:30:08.880 --> 00:30:09.600
 Oh, you've got loads.

00:30:09.600 --> 00:30:10.160
 You've done loads.

00:30:10.160 --> 00:30:10.720
 You've done loads.

00:30:10.720 --> 00:30:11.200
 Like, here's one.

00:30:11.200 --> 00:30:12.480
 Here's one from Dominic Brown.

00:30:12.480 --> 00:30:12.800
 Oh, I don't know.

00:30:12.800 --> 00:30:14.400
 He's a pretty intense host this time.

00:30:14.400 --> 00:30:15.440
 Yeah.

00:30:15.440 --> 00:30:17.120
 It's about time someone started cracking the whip.

00:30:17.120 --> 00:30:18.240
 No, I love this.

00:30:18.240 --> 00:30:19.680
 This is from Dominic Brown.

00:30:19.680 --> 00:30:21.920
 The US Navy has an army

00:30:21.920 --> 00:30:23.120
 which has an air force.

00:30:23.120 --> 00:30:26.400
 That's great.

00:30:26.400 --> 00:30:26.960
 I was looking this up

00:30:26.960 --> 00:30:28.080
 to try and find out a bit more about it.

00:30:28.080 --> 00:30:29.840
 It turns out that the US Army

00:30:29.840 --> 00:30:30.960
 also has its own Navy.

00:30:30.960 --> 00:30:34.880
 They've got...

00:30:34.880 --> 00:30:35.360
 I can't remember.

00:30:35.360 --> 00:30:36.800
 It's called Army Watercraft Systems,

00:30:36.800 --> 00:30:39.280
 and they have got 130 boats or ships

00:30:39.280 --> 00:30:40.800
 or vessels or whatever it is.

00:30:40.800 --> 00:30:41.360
 Right.

00:30:41.360 --> 00:30:42.960
 It must be quite confusing.

00:30:42.960 --> 00:30:43.520
 Yeah.

00:30:43.520 --> 00:30:45.440
 I go in here, Chelsea Pyle.

00:30:45.440 --> 00:30:46.080
 My husband told me this.

00:30:46.080 --> 00:30:47.360
 Sounds like a very expensive house.

00:30:47.360 --> 00:30:51.200
 My husband told me this interesting fact,

00:30:51.200 --> 00:30:52.640
 and I found an article to explain it.

00:30:52.640 --> 00:30:56.080
 When Mount St. Helens erupted in 1980,

00:30:56.080 --> 00:30:57.280
 the sound of the explosion

00:30:57.280 --> 00:30:59.760
 could be heard as far away as Canada.

00:30:59.760 --> 00:31:00.960
 So we kind of all know that, right?

00:31:00.960 --> 00:31:02.000
 Like it sort of went...

00:31:02.000 --> 00:31:02.800
 Where's Mount St. Helens?

00:31:02.800 --> 00:31:03.920
 Quite near Canada, right?

00:31:03.920 --> 00:31:04.160
 Is it?

00:31:04.160 --> 00:31:05.440
 Yeah.

00:31:05.440 --> 00:31:06.640
 I mean, it is, isn't it?

00:31:06.640 --> 00:31:07.040
 What?

00:31:07.040 --> 00:31:08.640
 It's in the Northwest of America.

00:31:08.640 --> 00:31:09.360
 Oh, the USA?

00:31:09.360 --> 00:31:09.680
 Yeah.

00:31:09.680 --> 00:31:10.160
 Oh, okay.

00:31:10.160 --> 00:31:10.960
 Okay.

00:31:10.960 --> 00:31:12.160
 It's in Washington.

00:31:12.160 --> 00:31:12.480
 Okay.

00:31:12.480 --> 00:31:13.120
 But still...

00:31:13.120 --> 00:31:14.000
 Oh, that's next door.

00:31:14.000 --> 00:31:15.200
 There's still a distance, though, right?

00:31:15.200 --> 00:31:16.320
 The point of the next sentence...

00:31:16.320 --> 00:31:17.360
 Several hundred miles away

00:31:17.360 --> 00:31:18.800
 that you can hear this eruption.

00:31:18.800 --> 00:31:19.120
 Yeah, right.

00:31:19.120 --> 00:31:19.760
 There you go.

00:31:19.760 --> 00:31:20.800
 The sound of the explosion

00:31:20.800 --> 00:31:22.960
 could be heard as far away as Canada.

00:31:22.960 --> 00:31:25.200
 But to those closest to the epicenter,

00:31:25.200 --> 00:31:26.400
 it made no sound at all.

00:31:26.400 --> 00:31:27.920
 Oh, I see.

00:31:27.920 --> 00:31:28.160
 What?

00:31:28.160 --> 00:31:28.560
 Yeah.

00:31:28.560 --> 00:31:29.120
 What?

00:31:29.120 --> 00:31:30.000
 That's pretty amazing.

00:31:30.000 --> 00:31:30.720
 Is this like a trick

00:31:30.720 --> 00:31:32.320
 because they were underwater or something?

00:31:32.320 --> 00:31:34.080
 How is that possible?

00:31:34.080 --> 00:31:35.840
 They were in a mudcrab vehicle,

00:31:35.840 --> 00:31:37.840
 setting a world record.

00:31:37.840 --> 00:31:38.720
 Is that...

00:31:38.720 --> 00:31:40.000
 How?

00:31:40.000 --> 00:31:42.000
 Is it like being in the eye of a storm?

00:31:42.000 --> 00:31:42.960
 I guess so, right?

00:31:42.960 --> 00:31:43.280
 Yeah.

00:31:43.280 --> 00:31:43.920
 Oh.

00:31:43.920 --> 00:31:44.480
 It can't be currently.

00:31:44.480 --> 00:31:44.880
 No, no, sorry.

00:31:44.880 --> 00:31:45.840
 I was just saying yes.

00:31:45.840 --> 00:31:47.440
 Is it like that?

00:31:47.440 --> 00:31:49.280
 I wasn't saying yes, it is.

00:31:49.600 --> 00:31:54.320
 It is weird because sound...

00:31:54.320 --> 00:31:57.280
 I don't feel like sound acts like the eye of a storm,

00:31:57.280 --> 00:31:59.040
 I guess, which is where it's whirling around you.

00:31:59.040 --> 00:32:00.320
 It's not like James talks,

00:32:00.320 --> 00:32:01.440
 and if I'm standing right in front of him,

00:32:01.440 --> 00:32:03.280
 I can't hear it, but if I step to the side...

00:32:03.280 --> 00:32:06.240
 And now James is miming at me for the distance at home.

00:32:06.240 --> 00:32:07.520
 That's a really good visual, Ken.

00:32:07.520 --> 00:32:08.160
 Yeah.

00:32:08.160 --> 00:32:08.800
 That was great.

00:32:08.800 --> 00:32:12.480
 If sound gets too loud,

00:32:12.480 --> 00:32:15.360
 it creates a shockwave rather than a sound wave.

00:32:15.360 --> 00:32:16.160
 Oh, yeah.

00:32:16.160 --> 00:32:17.760
 Oh, is that so?

00:32:17.760 --> 00:32:18.560
 Maybe it's that.

00:32:18.560 --> 00:32:18.960
 That's very good.

00:32:18.960 --> 00:32:20.080
 Do you not have the reason?

00:32:20.080 --> 00:32:22.240
 No, I mean, I'm clicking the link here with my finger

00:32:22.240 --> 00:32:24.480
 on this bit of paper, but it's not open.

00:32:24.480 --> 00:32:25.680
 Sorry, that's my fluff.

00:32:25.680 --> 00:32:26.240
 I should have...

00:32:26.240 --> 00:32:28.240
 Oh, dear.

00:32:28.240 --> 00:32:29.440
 Someone else read it.

00:32:29.440 --> 00:32:31.920
 This is from Hannah Killen or Kylan?

00:32:31.920 --> 00:32:32.640
 Kylan, I think.

00:32:32.640 --> 00:32:33.280
 Kylan, okay.

00:32:33.280 --> 00:32:35.120
 This is from Hannah Kylan.

00:32:35.120 --> 00:32:37.600
 During the World Wars, spies, mainly women,

00:32:37.600 --> 00:32:40.960
 were discovered because what would have given them away?

00:32:40.960 --> 00:32:42.480
 So they trained in language,

00:32:42.480 --> 00:32:44.960
 they trained in culture and manner.

00:32:44.960 --> 00:32:46.480
 What would have given them away?

00:32:46.480 --> 00:32:50.080
 Specifically, something specifically female that...

00:32:50.080 --> 00:32:52.160
 You know what, I thought it was going to be at first?

00:32:52.160 --> 00:32:54.400
 There was a woman who was arrested

00:32:54.400 --> 00:32:57.760
 because they had some weird writing on their buttocks.

00:32:57.760 --> 00:33:00.320
 And what had happened was they'd sat on a train

00:33:00.320 --> 00:33:02.000
 and they were worried about the dirty seats.

00:33:02.000 --> 00:33:04.720
 So I'd put some newspaper underneath their bum

00:33:04.720 --> 00:33:07.680
 and then the print had gone onto their bum cheeks

00:33:07.680 --> 00:33:09.360
 and it had been like backwards writing.

00:33:09.360 --> 00:33:10.560
 So they didn't really know what it said.

00:33:10.560 --> 00:33:12.480
 So they assumed that she'd been dispatched into the country

00:33:12.480 --> 00:33:14.960
 with a secret message for the resistance.

00:33:14.960 --> 00:33:16.400
 Exactly. Written on her bum.

00:33:16.400 --> 00:33:18.320
 And it just said, "Could you smell my ass?"

00:33:18.320 --> 00:33:23.680
 Was it they ordered pints instead?

00:33:23.680 --> 00:33:26.000
 And in Germany, you don't order pints.

00:33:26.000 --> 00:33:28.400
 No, I guess like famous examples are

00:33:28.400 --> 00:33:30.560
 a spy once was outed when she was giving birth

00:33:30.560 --> 00:33:33.040
 and she started swearing in her actual name

00:33:33.040 --> 00:33:34.400
 after that kind of stuff.

00:33:34.400 --> 00:33:35.760
 No, we talked about the spies,

00:33:35.760 --> 00:33:37.280
 the German spies who were caught in the UK

00:33:37.280 --> 00:33:39.280
 because didn't they have a lot of...

00:33:39.280 --> 00:33:40.960
 Was it sausages in their bag or something?

00:33:40.960 --> 00:33:44.080
 And there were French spies who were given away

00:33:44.080 --> 00:33:46.000
 because they smelled of garlic or something.

00:33:46.000 --> 00:33:46.720
 Do you remember that?

00:33:46.720 --> 00:33:47.920
 No, it's too crude.

00:33:47.920 --> 00:33:49.680
 Yeah, there was an Australian spy

00:33:49.680 --> 00:33:51.040
 who was throwing a boomerang.

00:33:51.040 --> 00:33:54.000
 There was a Mexican spy with a big sombrero.

00:33:54.000 --> 00:33:55.920
 It's so cute. There was one amazing story

00:33:55.920 --> 00:33:57.120
 where a guy was...

00:33:57.120 --> 00:33:59.120
 They thought he was a spy and they just couldn't get him.

00:33:59.120 --> 00:34:00.560
 They kept trying, they're interrogating,

00:34:00.560 --> 00:34:02.080
 doing all the tricks to get him to do.

00:34:02.080 --> 00:34:03.280
 And he was just flawless.

00:34:03.280 --> 00:34:05.760
 And then supposedly one day when crossing a road,

00:34:05.760 --> 00:34:07.840
 one of the people who was trying to out him

00:34:07.840 --> 00:34:10.000
 was behind him and went, "Watch out a car!"

00:34:10.000 --> 00:34:11.200
 And he looked the wrong way.

00:34:11.200 --> 00:34:11.760
 Brilliant.

00:34:11.760 --> 00:34:14.480
 And but like, you need a lot of witnesses.

00:34:14.480 --> 00:34:16.400
 Like, how does that hold up in court?

00:34:16.400 --> 00:34:16.880
 Yeah.

00:34:16.880 --> 00:34:18.000
 Everything else is...

00:34:18.000 --> 00:34:21.760
 Anyway, the answer here is that they knitted wrong.

00:34:21.760 --> 00:34:23.680
 So this is from a book by Debbie Stoller

00:34:23.680 --> 00:34:24.960
 called Stitch and Bitch.

00:34:24.960 --> 00:34:27.280
 And the idea is that Americans knit

00:34:27.280 --> 00:34:29.840
 in a very cumbersome, time-consuming way.

00:34:29.840 --> 00:34:31.120
 These are Hannah's words.

00:34:31.120 --> 00:34:32.080
 It feels like, yes.

00:34:32.080 --> 00:34:36.240
 Where they let go of the yarn

00:34:36.240 --> 00:34:37.600
 and then loop it around the needle.

00:34:37.600 --> 00:34:40.160
 Whereas Europeans never let go of the yarn

00:34:40.160 --> 00:34:41.920
 and can make the stitches much faster.

00:34:41.920 --> 00:34:44.240
 So they would be outed for their knitting style.

00:34:44.240 --> 00:34:44.480
 Wow.

00:34:44.480 --> 00:34:47.520
 So this is American spies in France,

00:34:47.520 --> 00:34:48.480
 presumably, or in Germany or whatever.

00:34:48.480 --> 00:34:50.240
 Yeah, it's going to be interesting.

00:34:50.240 --> 00:34:50.880
 Great fact.

00:34:50.880 --> 00:34:50.960
 Yeah.

00:34:50.960 --> 00:34:53.120
 Because in knitting, people used to knit codes

00:34:53.120 --> 00:34:54.480
 in various wars, didn't they?

00:34:54.480 --> 00:34:56.640
 Like, morse code into knitting.

00:34:56.640 --> 00:34:59.200
 You'd have specific lumps in your knitwear.

00:34:59.200 --> 00:35:00.240
 I don't know how much it was done

00:35:00.240 --> 00:35:02.560
 and how much there was a lot of fear mongering around.

00:35:02.560 --> 00:35:03.200
 Oh my God.

00:35:03.200 --> 00:35:05.040
 Is that person wearing a jumper

00:35:05.040 --> 00:35:07.600
 actually transmitting morse code to their friend?

00:35:07.600 --> 00:35:09.600
 But you could definitely knit code into stuff.

00:35:09.600 --> 00:35:11.280
 Remember that, also, that where they used to show you

00:35:11.280 --> 00:35:12.560
 people's heads and tattoo them?

00:35:12.560 --> 00:35:13.040
 Yes.

00:35:13.040 --> 00:35:14.320
 And then this is back in like--

00:35:14.320 --> 00:35:14.640
 I think--

00:35:14.640 --> 00:35:16.560
 This is a revolution, so it broke me at times.

00:35:16.560 --> 00:35:17.040
 Yeah.

00:35:17.040 --> 00:35:18.240
 And the hair would grow back.

00:35:18.240 --> 00:35:18.720
 Exactly.

00:35:18.720 --> 00:35:19.680
 There's a problem with that.

00:35:19.680 --> 00:35:22.240
 And with the pregnancy one.

00:35:22.240 --> 00:35:22.560
 Yeah.

00:35:22.560 --> 00:35:24.240
 Is you have to wait quite a long time

00:35:24.240 --> 00:35:26.880
 between setting it up and getting the pay off.

00:35:26.880 --> 00:35:29.040
 The message will be out of date by the time.

00:35:29.040 --> 00:35:29.840
 You would think so.

00:35:29.840 --> 00:35:30.560
 You would think so.

00:35:30.560 --> 00:35:31.680
 Wait, what was pregnancy one?

00:35:31.680 --> 00:35:33.040
 Well, like, for instance, the idea

00:35:33.040 --> 00:35:36.080
 that Dan mentioned, which was when a woman gives birth,

00:35:36.080 --> 00:35:37.600
 she'll swear in her own language.

00:35:37.600 --> 00:35:38.480
 Sorry, yes.

00:35:38.480 --> 00:35:40.720
 If you weren't sure someone was an agent

00:35:40.720 --> 00:35:42.400
 and you had to wait for them to get pregnant

00:35:42.400 --> 00:35:44.000
 and then wait nine months and then--

00:35:44.000 --> 00:35:44.160
 Yes.

00:35:44.160 --> 00:35:44.720
 Yeah.

00:35:44.720 --> 00:35:45.360
 Yeah.

00:35:45.360 --> 00:35:48.000
 And how are you going to impregnate them as well?

00:35:48.000 --> 00:35:48.560
 They're what it's not going to be.

00:35:48.560 --> 00:35:49.520
 Probably the normal way.

00:35:49.520 --> 00:35:54.880
 She got pregnant in a peculiarly British way.

00:35:54.880 --> 00:36:04.160
 All right.

00:36:04.160 --> 00:36:06.880
 This is from Jeremy Correken.

00:36:06.880 --> 00:36:10.320
 And he says, "My hometown, Rochester, New York,

00:36:10.320 --> 00:36:13.440
 forgot it had a nuclear reactor.

00:36:13.440 --> 00:36:16.800
 And it found out when they were about to tear it down."

00:36:16.800 --> 00:36:17.280
 And--

00:36:17.280 --> 00:36:19.360
 The wrecking ball has just swung back.

00:36:19.360 --> 00:36:23.280
 I've just thought of something.

00:36:23.280 --> 00:36:24.720
 And there's more detail on this.

00:36:24.720 --> 00:36:26.080
 And it's amazing, actually.

00:36:26.080 --> 00:36:26.960
 I'll just read it to you.

00:36:26.960 --> 00:36:29.600
 So Kodak may be a sinking ship.

00:36:29.600 --> 00:36:30.800
 Kodak the company.

00:36:30.800 --> 00:36:31.120
 Oh, yeah.

00:36:31.120 --> 00:36:33.440
 A humorously written piece here.

00:36:33.440 --> 00:36:35.840
 But apparently it's a nuclear sinking ship

00:36:35.840 --> 00:36:36.880
 for more than 30 years.

00:36:36.880 --> 00:36:39.920
 The company kept a small reactor running in its basement

00:36:39.920 --> 00:36:40.960
 in Rochester.

00:36:40.960 --> 00:36:44.160
 And it was used for research and powered by 3.5 pounds

00:36:44.160 --> 00:36:45.040
 of uranium.

00:36:45.040 --> 00:36:46.400
 Kodak the--

00:36:46.400 --> 00:36:47.360
 I think the camera--

00:36:47.360 --> 00:36:48.160
 The camera people.

00:36:48.160 --> 00:36:49.120
 The camera people.

00:36:49.120 --> 00:36:50.160
 Had their own nuclear.

00:36:50.160 --> 00:36:51.680
 Believe so.

00:36:51.680 --> 00:36:52.400
 That's amazing.

00:36:52.400 --> 00:36:54.400
 And it's the kind they make bombs from.

00:36:54.400 --> 00:36:56.000
 Apparently--

00:36:56.000 --> 00:36:56.880
 Wow.

00:36:56.880 --> 00:36:57.920
 They took precautions.

00:36:57.920 --> 00:37:00.320
 The reactor was locked away in a concrete bunker.

00:37:00.320 --> 00:37:01.360
 It never leaks.

00:37:01.360 --> 00:37:03.520
 And I'm just going to skip through and try

00:37:03.520 --> 00:37:05.040
 to find out why Kodak would keep getting

00:37:05.040 --> 00:37:05.760
 a nuclear reactor.

00:37:05.760 --> 00:37:07.280
 Is that originally what photobombing was?

00:37:07.280 --> 00:37:10.320
 It was much more dangerous, yeah.

00:37:10.320 --> 00:37:11.360
 So good.

00:37:11.360 --> 00:37:14.160
 So starting decades ago, Kodak had an interest

00:37:14.160 --> 00:37:16.960
 in neutrons, subatomic particles that can be used

00:37:16.960 --> 00:37:19.440
 to determine the makeup of a given material

00:37:19.440 --> 00:37:22.080
 or create an image of it without damaging it.

00:37:22.080 --> 00:37:22.160
 Yeah, you can see that.

00:37:22.160 --> 00:37:24.960
 OK, so you can fire neutrons at something

00:37:24.960 --> 00:37:26.000
 and get an image of it.

00:37:26.000 --> 00:37:29.600
 And to do that, you need to create a nuclear reactor

00:37:29.600 --> 00:37:31.680
 in order to generate a bunch of neutrons, I guess.

00:37:31.680 --> 00:37:31.920
 Wow.

00:37:31.920 --> 00:37:32.880
 How else are you going to do it?

00:37:32.880 --> 00:37:33.680
 That's incredible.

00:37:33.680 --> 00:37:34.400
 Can I do one?

00:37:34.400 --> 00:37:34.880
 Yeah.

00:37:34.880 --> 00:37:37.760
 Elizabeth Royce writes, "There's a bridge in West Virginia

00:37:37.760 --> 00:37:40.880
 which was only fixed after the Soviet Union intervened."

00:37:40.880 --> 00:37:43.360
 This is great.

00:37:43.360 --> 00:37:45.600
 So I sort of looked up what was going on here

00:37:45.600 --> 00:37:46.880
 and basically it was an article about it

00:37:46.880 --> 00:37:48.480
 on the Blue Ridge Country website.

00:37:48.480 --> 00:37:50.960
 It's called Vulcan, this place, this tiny town.

00:37:50.960 --> 00:37:53.120
 Very few people living there.

00:37:53.120 --> 00:37:54.720
 They had no safe way to drive out of town

00:37:54.720 --> 00:37:57.280
 because there was a bridge that collapsed in 1974.

00:37:57.280 --> 00:37:58.560
 The only way you could get in and out

00:37:58.560 --> 00:38:01.040
 was to drive up the Kentucky side of the tug,

00:38:01.040 --> 00:38:02.320
 which I guess is the river,

00:38:02.320 --> 00:38:04.400
 and walk across a narrow, swinging bridge.

00:38:04.400 --> 00:38:06.480
 Children had to crawl under parked railroad cars

00:38:06.480 --> 00:38:08.240
 at the railroad's bridge to get to school.

00:38:08.240 --> 00:38:10.480
 One child lost a leg doing that.

00:38:10.480 --> 00:38:13.280
 So just like horrible situation and, you know,

00:38:13.280 --> 00:38:14.080
 just a nightmare.

00:38:14.080 --> 00:38:15.120
 They can't get in and out of town.

00:38:15.120 --> 00:38:17.600
 And this guy called John Robinette,

00:38:17.600 --> 00:38:20.000
 who was the self-appointed mayor apparently,

00:38:20.000 --> 00:38:23.600
 wrote to the Soviet Embassy in 1977 in Whattington, DC,

00:38:23.600 --> 00:38:26.320
 describing Vulcan's plight and requesting foreign aid for a bridge.

00:38:26.320 --> 00:38:31.920
 And the Soviets dispatched a journalist who reported back saying,

00:38:31.920 --> 00:38:33.120
 "Yes, of course, we'll fund your bridge.

00:38:33.120 --> 00:38:35.440
 If America can't do this, we will pay for it."

00:38:35.440 --> 00:38:36.560
 Nice.

00:38:36.560 --> 00:38:38.000
 Because of the PR, PR coup.

00:38:38.000 --> 00:38:40.160
 Within hours of that journalist visiting,

00:38:40.160 --> 00:38:42.400
 word came down from the governor saying,

00:38:42.400 --> 00:38:44.480
 "Yeah, we'll build a bridge. We'll build a bridge."

00:38:44.480 --> 00:38:45.200
 And there we go.

00:38:45.200 --> 00:38:48.240
 They kept the promise and eventually the bridge was delivered.

00:38:48.240 --> 00:38:49.200
 According to news reports,

00:38:49.200 --> 00:38:52.080
 Vulcan residents celebrated with illegally imported Russian vodka.

00:38:52.080 --> 00:38:52.560
 Nice.

00:38:52.560 --> 00:38:53.840
 In the American flag hung high.

00:38:53.840 --> 00:38:54.800
 That's a good story.

00:38:54.800 --> 00:38:55.840
 Mia Tappin says,

00:38:55.840 --> 00:38:59.360
 "A lone word is a word borrowed from another language.

00:39:00.000 --> 00:39:04.400
 A calque is a direct translation of one word into another language."

00:39:04.400 --> 00:39:05.200
 See?

00:39:05.200 --> 00:39:06.320
 Subtle difference.

00:39:06.320 --> 00:39:06.960
 Remember that.

00:39:06.960 --> 00:39:10.160
 The word calque, and bear in mind my spelling this,

00:39:10.160 --> 00:39:12.000
 C-A-L-Q-U-E,

00:39:12.000 --> 00:39:14.640
 the word calque is an example of a lone word

00:39:14.640 --> 00:39:16.640
 because it comes from the French word calque.

00:39:16.640 --> 00:39:19.840
 And the word lone word is an example of a calque

00:39:19.840 --> 00:39:23.200
 because it's directly translated from German as lane word,

00:39:23.200 --> 00:39:24.320
 meaning lone word.

00:39:24.320 --> 00:39:25.520
 That's super.

00:39:25.520 --> 00:39:26.400
 So good.

00:39:26.400 --> 00:39:26.960
 Wow.

00:39:26.960 --> 00:39:28.080
 I love that.

00:39:28.080 --> 00:39:29.440
 Yeah, that's amazing.

00:39:29.440 --> 00:39:30.080
 Here's a fun one.

00:39:30.080 --> 00:39:31.280
 This is from Dan Maynard.

00:39:31.280 --> 00:39:33.840
 "Hey, I have a fun fact about Aussie Osborne.

00:39:33.840 --> 00:39:35.520
 I tried sending it to James on Instagram,

00:39:35.520 --> 00:39:36.560
 but not sure if you'll see it."

00:39:36.560 --> 00:39:40.880
 Sorry, that's not the fact.

00:39:40.880 --> 00:39:42.400
 I don't really know how Instagram works,

00:39:42.400 --> 00:39:43.120
 I'll be honest.

00:39:43.120 --> 00:39:43.760
 I am on it.

00:39:43.760 --> 00:39:45.760
 No such thing as James Harkin.

00:39:45.760 --> 00:39:46.800
 He is.

00:39:46.800 --> 00:39:47.360
 I can prove that,

00:39:47.360 --> 00:39:49.440
 because I watch him post stuff from @shribeland.

00:39:49.440 --> 00:39:51.040
 Jesus Christ.

00:39:51.040 --> 00:39:52.720
 The self-plugging is off the chouser.

00:39:52.720 --> 00:39:54.240
 Anna, anything you want to...?

00:39:54.240 --> 00:39:56.000
 I've got nothing, thanks.

00:39:56.000 --> 00:39:56.880
 Well, Dan writes,

00:39:56.880 --> 00:39:58.160
 "If you don't already know the story,

00:39:58.160 --> 00:40:00.880
 in 1972, Black Sabbath were recording Volume 4

00:40:00.880 --> 00:40:02.480
 in a mansion in Bel-Air.

00:40:02.480 --> 00:40:04.240
 Aussie went and adjusted the thermostat

00:40:04.240 --> 00:40:05.440
 and continued on with the day.

00:40:05.440 --> 00:40:07.840
 Next thing, the cops turn up,

00:40:07.840 --> 00:40:08.800
 sirens blaring,

00:40:08.800 --> 00:40:12.160
 and here everyone thinks it's a drug raid in the house

00:40:12.160 --> 00:40:13.440
 and proceeded to flush away

00:40:13.440 --> 00:40:15.280
 and snort as many drugs as possible.

00:40:15.280 --> 00:40:17.040
 It turns out,

00:40:17.040 --> 00:40:19.120
 Aussie had not adjusted the thermostat,

00:40:19.120 --> 00:40:21.040
 he had in fact hit the emergency call button

00:40:21.040 --> 00:40:22.400
 and alerted the local police.

00:40:22.400 --> 00:40:25.280
 And they were just there to check if everything was okay.

00:40:25.280 --> 00:40:27.200
 We're back, we're back.

00:40:28.160 --> 00:40:29.280
 Let's get back.

00:40:29.280 --> 00:40:30.560
 I suppose there's no crime,

00:40:30.560 --> 00:40:32.560
 there's no criminal offence of having taken drugs,

00:40:32.560 --> 00:40:33.760
 even like five minutes ago.

00:40:33.760 --> 00:40:35.840
 That's really interesting,

00:40:35.840 --> 00:40:38.560
 and I think no one's ever properly tried that in court,

00:40:38.560 --> 00:40:40.560
 because I think that is, in theory, that is true,

00:40:40.560 --> 00:40:43.040
 but it's difficult to say that something's never been

00:40:43.040 --> 00:40:44.880
 in your possession if you've taken it,

00:40:44.880 --> 00:40:46.400
 especially as it's in your body.

00:40:46.400 --> 00:40:47.600
 But if you've taken every bit of it,

00:40:47.600 --> 00:40:49.360
 and it's just fizzing around your nervous system,

00:40:49.360 --> 00:40:51.520
 is it, like, is that still possession?

00:40:51.520 --> 00:40:52.960
 Possession is illegal,

00:40:52.960 --> 00:40:56.080
 and if it's in your stomach, arguably, you're possessing it.

00:40:56.080 --> 00:40:58.800
 And it's very difficult to say it's in my stomach,

00:40:58.800 --> 00:41:00.960
 but at no stage did I ever possess it.

00:41:00.960 --> 00:41:02.720
 This is quite a fun one.

00:41:02.720 --> 00:41:05.040
 Chuck Norris once helped deliver a baby on a helicopter?

00:41:05.040 --> 00:41:05.840
 No, he didn't.

00:41:05.840 --> 00:41:08.480
 This is from James Wetter.

00:41:08.480 --> 00:41:10.480
 It happened in 2013.

00:41:10.480 --> 00:41:12.320
 There was a woman in, you know, the Ars of Silly?

00:41:12.320 --> 00:41:13.360
 Yes.

00:41:13.360 --> 00:41:14.640
 When you're pregnant and you're about to give birth,

00:41:14.640 --> 00:41:15.520
 you go to the mainland.

00:41:15.520 --> 00:41:15.760
 Yeah.

00:41:15.760 --> 00:41:19.520
 But she went into labour

00:41:19.520 --> 00:41:22.640
 and then gave birth in mid-air on the helicopter.

00:41:22.640 --> 00:41:23.360
 Okay.

00:41:23.360 --> 00:41:26.000
 And Chuck Norris happened to be on that helicopter flight,

00:41:26.000 --> 00:41:26.320
 right?

00:41:26.320 --> 00:41:30.000
 On board the helicopter was Lieutenant Commander Chuck Norris.

00:41:30.000 --> 00:41:32.080
 He was the observer on board the helicopter.

00:41:32.080 --> 00:41:33.200
 Come on.

00:41:33.200 --> 00:41:36.800
 And, yeah, the baby was born mid-air.

00:41:36.800 --> 00:41:39.280
 And they took off with seven passengers on board

00:41:39.280 --> 00:41:40.160
 and landed with eight.

00:41:40.160 --> 00:41:41.040
 That's so cool.

00:41:41.040 --> 00:41:42.560
 And then in 2022, it happened again.

00:41:42.560 --> 00:41:44.000
 Chuck Norris again?

00:41:44.000 --> 00:41:45.360
 No, don't think so.

00:41:45.360 --> 00:41:46.000
 I'm not sure.

00:41:46.000 --> 00:41:49.600
 Here's one for you, Andy.

00:41:49.600 --> 00:41:53.760
 If you're in a certain town in Switzerland,

00:41:53.760 --> 00:41:54.800
 whose name escapes me,

00:41:55.680 --> 00:42:00.400
 once a year, you can get a helicopter ride for six euros fifty.

00:42:00.400 --> 00:42:01.760
 Riddle me this.

00:42:01.760 --> 00:42:03.120
 Is this?

00:42:03.120 --> 00:42:05.200
 Normally, of course, it would cost you a lot of money to get a helicopter.

00:42:05.200 --> 00:42:05.520
 Right, okay.

00:42:05.520 --> 00:42:06.880
 And where is this one, so?

00:42:06.880 --> 00:42:08.320
 It's in Switzerland somewhere.

00:42:08.320 --> 00:42:10.160
 And is this for me because I'm cheap?

00:42:10.160 --> 00:42:12.800
 No, no, it's because you like infrastructure.

00:42:12.800 --> 00:42:16.640
 And, you know, vehicles and stuff like that.

00:42:16.640 --> 00:42:17.840
 So are you hitching a lift on?

00:42:17.840 --> 00:42:18.800
 I've given too much away.

00:42:18.800 --> 00:42:21.360
 Are you hitching a lift because it's flying under a,

00:42:21.360 --> 00:42:24.400
 what do I like, a finicky, a tour finicky railway?

00:42:24.400 --> 00:42:27.680
 It's a bane of moss and everyone's refusing to get in it.

00:42:27.680 --> 00:42:28.800
 So priceless.

00:42:28.800 --> 00:42:30.080
 Think finiculars.

00:42:30.080 --> 00:42:31.120
 That's a link here.

00:42:31.120 --> 00:42:31.600
 Okay.

00:42:31.600 --> 00:42:33.680
 So rather than a funicular helicopter,

00:42:33.680 --> 00:42:36.000
 whereby it's attached to a tower

00:42:36.000 --> 00:42:39.280
 and the rotors provide the power to lift it.

00:42:39.280 --> 00:42:40.080
 Brilliant.

00:42:40.080 --> 00:42:41.920
 But you're going by helicopter.

00:42:41.920 --> 00:42:42.400
 I've got it.

00:42:42.400 --> 00:42:43.120
 I think I've got it.

00:42:43.120 --> 00:42:45.360
 Is it a, it's like a rail replacement bus service,

00:42:45.360 --> 00:42:47.520
 except it's a finicular replacement helicopter.

00:42:47.520 --> 00:42:48.000
 Exactly.

00:42:48.000 --> 00:42:50.080
 It's now amazing.

00:42:50.080 --> 00:42:52.240
 And they're not allowed to charge more than the finicular.

00:42:52.240 --> 00:42:52.800
 Precisely.

00:42:52.800 --> 00:42:57.200
 So once a year, they have to put the finicular into maintenance,

00:42:57.200 --> 00:42:59.120
 but they still need to get to their village.

00:42:59.120 --> 00:43:02.800
 And so the government puts on a rail replacement helicopter.

00:43:02.800 --> 00:43:04.640
 And of course they can only charge you the amount

00:43:04.640 --> 00:43:06.240
 that you would charge if it was a train.

00:43:06.240 --> 00:43:08.160
 That is so good.

00:43:08.160 --> 00:43:09.280
 I would just wait at the bottom.

00:43:09.280 --> 00:43:09.840
 No, thank you.

00:43:09.840 --> 00:43:10.880
 I don't need to get home.

00:43:10.880 --> 00:43:12.960
 I'll just wait for the finicular to be back in service.

00:43:12.960 --> 00:43:18.720
 There's a fact I said ages ago.

00:43:18.720 --> 00:43:20.800
 And when I say fact, it's something I said out loud

00:43:20.800 --> 00:43:22.000
 that I'd love to confirm.

00:43:22.000 --> 00:43:23.200
 And I still haven't confirmed it.

00:43:23.200 --> 00:43:24.560
 And I promise I've been looking, which

00:43:24.560 --> 00:43:26.640
 is that there was a story that Chuck Norris,

00:43:26.640 --> 00:43:28.640
 the actual Chuck Norris actor, as opposed

00:43:28.640 --> 00:43:32.160
 to the helicopter pilot, all of his movies are arguably,

00:43:32.160 --> 00:43:34.800
 I think, a bit B movie-ish, not very good.

00:43:34.800 --> 00:43:36.640
 You'd watch it for the fighting, right?

00:43:36.640 --> 00:43:37.680
 He's got kids.

00:43:37.680 --> 00:43:39.360
 He doesn't want his kids to watch his movies,

00:43:39.360 --> 00:43:40.400
 because it has fighting.

00:43:40.400 --> 00:43:43.200
 So the story is, is that Chuck Norris edits out

00:43:43.200 --> 00:43:45.040
 the fighting scenes from his movies,

00:43:45.040 --> 00:43:49.360
 and then lets his kids just watch the shitty experiments.

00:43:49.360 --> 00:43:50.560
 That's the whole movie.

00:43:50.560 --> 00:43:51.600
 That's so funny.

00:43:51.600 --> 00:43:52.240
 Chuck Norris.

00:43:52.240 --> 00:43:53.920
 But I read it in an interview with him once,

00:43:53.920 --> 00:43:55.040
 and I can't find it anywhere.

00:43:55.040 --> 00:43:55.920
 So I'm still looking.

00:43:55.920 --> 00:43:56.800
 I'm still on the hunt.

00:43:56.800 --> 00:43:57.040
 Wow.

00:43:57.040 --> 00:43:58.080
 That's a great fact.

00:43:58.080 --> 00:44:01.040
 This is a good one from Dylan Difford.

00:44:01.040 --> 00:44:06.320
 In May 2005, the British Department of Trade and Industry

00:44:06.320 --> 00:44:09.200
 was briefly renamed the Department of Productivity, Energy

00:44:09.200 --> 00:44:10.160
 and Industry.

00:44:10.160 --> 00:44:12.480
 But the name was reverted after one week

00:44:12.480 --> 00:44:15.120
 when it was suggested that this made Minister Alan Johnson,

00:44:15.120 --> 00:44:18.480
 if you remember him, the Productivity, Energy,

00:44:18.480 --> 00:44:20.960
 and Industry Secretary, or Penis.

00:44:21.520 --> 00:44:26.320
 I can't imagine Mr. Johnson had any problem with that.

00:44:26.320 --> 00:44:27.920
 Oh, well indeed he did.

00:44:27.920 --> 00:44:28.560
 Very good.

00:44:28.560 --> 00:44:32.240
 I think this is the shortest one we've got from Stuart Marsh.

00:44:32.240 --> 00:44:34.400
 The company that makes square fire extinguishers

00:44:34.400 --> 00:44:35.200
 is called Oval.

00:44:35.200 --> 00:44:39.440
 What?

00:44:39.440 --> 00:44:42.560
 I've never seen a square fire extinguisher.

00:44:42.560 --> 00:44:44.880
 I think I looked it up when that fact came into the inbox,

00:44:44.880 --> 00:44:45.360
 and it's--

00:44:45.360 --> 00:44:46.400
 What an odd thing to have.

00:44:46.400 --> 00:44:47.120
 They're real.

00:44:47.120 --> 00:44:47.520
 They are real.

00:44:47.520 --> 00:44:48.160
 That's amazing.

00:44:48.160 --> 00:44:49.440
 Do we know why?

00:44:49.440 --> 00:44:51.040
 OK, here's an idea.

00:44:51.040 --> 00:44:54.880
 You put them on a ship, and then they won't roll away.

00:44:54.880 --> 00:44:55.280
 Yeah.

00:44:55.280 --> 00:44:56.160
 Brilliant.

00:44:56.160 --> 00:44:56.880
 Very good.

00:44:56.880 --> 00:44:58.080
 Safe all over.

00:44:58.080 --> 00:44:58.320
 Yeah.

00:44:58.320 --> 00:44:58.800
 Nice.

00:44:58.800 --> 00:45:01.680
 And that is the only reason I can possibly take off for a--

00:45:01.680 --> 00:45:04.800
 Easier to stack in the warehouse.

00:45:04.800 --> 00:45:05.040
 Yeah.

00:45:05.040 --> 00:45:09.280
 If I was shopping for a square fire extinguisher

00:45:09.280 --> 00:45:11.680
 and I was a ship captain, I wouldn't open up the website

00:45:11.680 --> 00:45:15.040
 that was OvalExtinguishers.com.

00:45:15.040 --> 00:45:18.400
 This is from Amy Apple, and apparently was also sent in

00:45:18.400 --> 00:45:19.600
 by John Turbow.

00:45:19.600 --> 00:45:20.240
 Yeah.

00:45:20.240 --> 00:45:25.120
 And Turbow was my nickname when I was younger.

00:45:25.120 --> 00:45:25.680
 It was.

00:45:25.680 --> 00:45:28.320
 And John's your brother's name, so is there some sort of--

00:45:28.320 --> 00:45:31.680
 The fact is that a few years ago,

00:45:31.680 --> 00:45:34.480
 Nicholas Fazel, a biology that University of Lausanne

00:45:34.480 --> 00:45:38.400
 in Switzerland and his colleagues developed a fascination

00:45:38.400 --> 00:45:40.800
 with the penises of seratine bats,

00:45:40.800 --> 00:45:42.800
 which is a species found in woodlands and the attics

00:45:42.800 --> 00:45:43.600
 of old buildings.

00:45:43.600 --> 00:45:47.600
 Seratine bats sport abnormally long penises

00:45:47.600 --> 00:45:49.840
 with wide heart-shaped heads.

00:45:49.840 --> 00:45:52.080
 When erect, the members are around seven times longer

00:45:52.080 --> 00:45:54.720
 than the female's vagina, and their bulbous heads

00:45:54.720 --> 00:45:57.840
 are seven times wider than the vaginal opening.

00:45:57.840 --> 00:45:59.920
 Oh, it's a lot of detail, isn't it?

00:45:59.920 --> 00:46:03.200
 Anyway, Fazel wondered, as you would, how does this work?

00:46:03.200 --> 00:46:05.040
 How can they use that for copulation?

00:46:05.040 --> 00:46:06.640
 Long and short of it, as it were.

00:46:06.640 --> 00:46:08.080
 The long and wide--

00:46:08.080 --> 00:46:11.760
 Basically, they hang upside down.

00:46:11.760 --> 00:46:13.920
 The male climbs onto the female's back

00:46:13.920 --> 00:46:15.920
 and gets her neck, as bats do.

00:46:15.920 --> 00:46:18.480
 But then he uses his erect penis

00:46:18.480 --> 00:46:21.520
 to push the female's tail membrane to the side,

00:46:21.520 --> 00:46:24.560
 locates her vulva, and then he just puts his penis

00:46:24.560 --> 00:46:28.160
 on her vagina, and copulates there.

00:46:28.160 --> 00:46:29.520
 So it's more of a--

00:46:29.520 --> 00:46:30.960
 It's more like a cloacal kiss.

00:46:30.960 --> 00:46:33.040
 It's a cloacal kiss, yes.

00:46:33.040 --> 00:46:34.800
 It's a nice way of putting it.

00:46:34.800 --> 00:46:37.040
 God, they do have massive penises, bats.

00:46:37.040 --> 00:46:37.680
 Do you remember I got--

00:46:37.680 --> 00:46:39.040
 Do you not remember?

00:46:39.040 --> 00:46:42.320
 I showed you a photo, and I got sent a picture

00:46:42.320 --> 00:46:44.000
 by Colonel John Blastridge Snell

00:46:44.000 --> 00:46:45.280
 when he was out on his expedition.

00:46:45.280 --> 00:46:47.200
 So look at this big bat, and I opened it.

00:46:47.200 --> 00:46:51.360
 It was a bat that strung up with this giant floppy penis.

00:46:51.360 --> 00:46:52.160
 It was huge.

00:46:52.160 --> 00:46:53.760
 It was huge.

00:46:53.760 --> 00:46:54.240
 Wow.

00:46:54.240 --> 00:46:54.800
 I'm still--

00:46:54.800 --> 00:46:57.680
 It's still burnt in my memory as a terrifying image.

00:46:57.680 --> 00:46:58.960
 Holy dick pic, that's bad.

00:46:58.960 --> 00:47:09.440
 Okay, that's it.

00:47:09.440 --> 00:47:10.640
 That's all of your facts.

00:47:10.640 --> 00:47:11.680
 Thank you very much for listening,

00:47:11.680 --> 00:47:13.040

 I'm on threads, no such thing as James Harkin,

00:47:28.880 --> 00:47:30.560
 but I haven't done any threading.

00:47:30.560 --> 00:47:30.960
 Okay.

00:47:30.960 --> 00:47:32.960
 Exciting.

00:47:32.960 --> 00:47:33.360
 Dan.

 We have various--

00:47:51.760 --> 00:47:53.680
 A few other endeavors that we're up to.

00:47:53.680 --> 00:47:56.560
 We also have a portal there to Club Fish,

 the exclusive members lounge,

00:47:59.760 --> 00:48:01.840
 which is a really fun place to be.

00:48:01.840 --> 00:48:02.960
 Isn't that right, guys?

00:48:02.960 --> 00:48:04.320
 It sure is.

00:48:04.320 --> 00:48:05.840

 every month or so we do a Drop As Align,

00:48:10.720 --> 00:48:13.040
 which is of a similar bent.

00:48:13.040 --> 00:48:13.520
 Yeah, yeah.

00:48:13.520 --> 00:48:14.480
 There's bonus stuff.

00:48:14.480 --> 00:48:15.680
