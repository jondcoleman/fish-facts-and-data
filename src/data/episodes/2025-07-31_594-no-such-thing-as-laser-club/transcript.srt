00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,640
 Hi everyone, welcome to this, the first of two very special episodes of No Such Thing

2
00:00:07,640 --> 00:00:12,960
 as a Fish. Now, anyone who's into comedy will know that the Edinburgh Fringe Festival

3
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:18,080
 has just begun up in Scotland and we are not going there this year but what we thought

4
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:23,640
 we would do is highlight some of our very favourite comedians who will be up there.

5
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:27,480
 So if you're travelling up to Edinburgh, you can listen to this and decide who you

6
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:32,920
 like and who you want to get tickets for. These are some of our very, very favourite

7
00:00:32,920 --> 00:00:38,200
 comedians out on the circuit right now. We handpicked ones who we think you will especially

8
00:00:38,200 --> 00:00:39,200
 like.

9
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:45,640
 Fact number one will be Ian Smith. He was nominated in 2023 for Best Show at Edinburgh

10
00:00:45,640 --> 00:00:51,640
 for his show Crushing and he is the co-host of the Northern News Podcast with Amy Gladhill.

11
00:00:51,640 --> 00:00:55,320
 It's an absolutely brilliant podcast. If you're not going up to Edinburgh then definitely

12
00:00:55,320 --> 00:01:01,900
 check that out and find out more about him. After Ian, you will hear from Abby Howells.

13
00:01:01,900 --> 00:01:06,960
 Now Abby is a New Zealand comic. You will know her from New Zealand Taskmaster and from

14
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:11,780
 Guy Montgomery's Guy Monspelling Bee. I know a lot of people in the UK dig around the internet

15
00:01:11,780 --> 00:01:16,600
 to find episodes of those and Abby is a particular favourite of anyone who likes New Zealand

16
00:01:16,600 --> 00:01:21,480
 comedy. She will be up in Edinburgh this year so definitely check out her show.

17
00:01:21,480 --> 00:01:27,800
 The third person, fact number three will come from Aruj Ashfak. Now Aruj, she won the Best

18
00:01:27,800 --> 00:01:33,980
 Newcomer at Edinburgh for her show Oh No in 2023. She is based in Mumbai and in fact

19
00:01:33,980 --> 00:01:38,600
 she was the first India based comedian to ever win the award. She's absolutely brilliant,

20
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:40,920
 absolutely lovely. I know you'll love her.

21
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:46,440
 And then finally fact number four will come from Nish Kumar who needs no introduction

22
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:51,240
 I'm sure to anyone listening to this podcast but you'll know him from all British panel

23
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:57,060
 shows especially of course QI. Now a fifth person from this podcast who will be at the

24
00:01:57,060 --> 00:02:03,240
 Edinburgh Fringe is a young up and coming start up called Dan Schreiber. He will be

25
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:08,680
 here with his other podcast The Cryptid Factor which I know a lot of you are fans of. He'll

26
00:02:08,680 --> 00:02:13,740
 be here with Buttons and with Rhys Darby and they will be doing their crazy thing at the

27
00:02:13,740 --> 00:02:19,000
 Gilded Balloon in the first week of the festival. So if you want to see Dan up there you're

28
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:23,840
 going to have to get in there quick. Anyway I really really hope you enjoy this podcast.

29
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:28,360
 It's something a bit new for us having four different guests on but we really enjoy doing

30
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:32,680
 it and I really hope you guys will enjoy it too. If you like what you hear from Nish,

31
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:37,160
 Aruj, Abby or Ian then definitely check those out. If you're not going to Edinburgh then

32
00:02:37,160 --> 00:02:41,320
 get on the internet, follow them all on social media, find out everything they've done on

33
00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:45,860
 YouTube etc. And if you are going to Edinburgh and you see any of them then make sure you

34
00:02:45,860 --> 00:02:50,540
 tell them that NoSix Thinkers and Fish sent you. Anyway that's enough from me. There's

35
00:02:50,540 --> 00:02:53,500
 not much more to say apart from on with the podcast.

36
00:02:53,500 --> 00:03:21,020
 Hello and welcome to another episode of NoSix Thinkers of Fish, a weekly podcast coming

37
00:03:21,020 --> 00:03:27,180
 to you from eight undisclosed locations around the world. My name is Dan Schreiber, I am

38
00:03:27,180 --> 00:03:32,780
 sitting here with Anna Tyshinski, Andrew Hunter Murray, James Harkin and four very

39
00:03:32,780 --> 00:03:37,540
 special guests and once again we have gathered around the microphones with our four favourite

40
00:03:37,540 --> 00:03:44,300
 facts from the last seven days and in no particular order here we go. Starting with fact number

41
00:03:44,300 --> 00:03:51,580
 one and that is Ian Smith. At the 2020 British Puzzle Championship, Sarah Mills solved a

42
00:03:51,580 --> 00:03:57,100
 1000 piece jigsaw puzzle in one hour and 40 minutes. That's an average of one piece every

43
00:03:57,100 --> 00:04:03,260
 six seconds. That's not possible right? Like surely. No, I think it's easy, isn't it? Oh

44
00:04:03,260 --> 00:04:08,900
 come on. Really? Six seconds. Sarah Mills listening to the podcast Furious. I don't know,

45
00:04:08,900 --> 00:04:16,100
 that was a long time, right? And at the end, like the last one, you don't have to think

46
00:04:16,100 --> 00:04:21,780
 about that. Okay, so we can minus the last one in the first one, right? The time is

47
00:04:21,780 --> 00:04:28,620
 sort of really extended out by that first bit where you're just turning them all around.

48
00:04:28,620 --> 00:04:36,220
 Ian, why are you into jigsaws? Is that why you picked this? Well, not really, no. I think

49
00:04:36,220 --> 00:04:42,260
 it started because I was in the Highlands. Me and my girlfriend, we walked past a charity

50
00:04:42,260 --> 00:04:52,420
 shop and we saw like a mad Ravensburger jigsaw, like a really surreal underwater scene that

51
00:04:52,420 --> 00:04:58,780
 looked like it had been compiled by a kind of like Salvador Dali-esque artist. And she

52
00:04:58,780 --> 00:05:03,460
 was laughing at it and she said she'd really loved the jigsaw. But the shop was closed.

53
00:05:03,460 --> 00:05:09,860
 So just by googling descriptions of what I saw in the jigsaw, I tried to track it down.

54
00:05:09,860 --> 00:05:15,340
 And we did that, but then I became very paranoid. I think I have this pessimism that as the

55
00:05:15,340 --> 00:05:20,220
 jigsaw was getting closer to completion, I was convinced that a piece wasn't there.

56
00:05:20,220 --> 00:05:23,260
 Right. Oh, Ian, I thought what you were going to

57
00:05:23,260 --> 00:05:27,140
 say is that when you finished it, she was going to split up with you and the jigsaw was

58
00:05:27,140 --> 00:05:33,920
 the only thing keeping you together. So I'm hiding pieces around the house. No, I sort

59
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:40,520
 of, I lost my head a little bit. And at one point, I'm not proud of this. I emptied the

60
00:05:40,520 --> 00:05:46,540
 Hoover and I looked through all the dust because I thought I'd hoovered up a jigsaw piece.

61
00:05:46,540 --> 00:05:50,740
 I think at one point it was pointing out to me that I'm getting the floor very dirty.

62
00:05:50,740 --> 00:05:54,940
 But I was very happy with that because I was holding a Hoover. I had all the tools to sort

63
00:05:54,940 --> 00:06:02,900
 of clean this up again. But yeah, the piece wasn't missing. The piece was resting on top

64
00:06:02,900 --> 00:06:07,460
 of the jigsaw on a color that it looked similar to. No.

65
00:06:07,460 --> 00:06:11,380
 But yeah, then I sort of entered a jigsaw speed tournament because I thought that'd

66
00:06:11,380 --> 00:06:17,420
 be a fun thing to do with my girlfriend. But yeah, we accidentally entered, I think like

67
00:06:17,420 --> 00:06:23,260
 a championship event. The barriers to entry in the jigsaw world

68
00:06:23,260 --> 00:06:28,420
 seems lower as in normally you can't accidentally enter like the 100 meters at the Olympics.

69
00:06:28,420 --> 00:06:31,940
 And like they really are strict about that. So were you a pair entry? Because this is

70
00:06:31,940 --> 00:06:36,100
 the thing, isn't it? Like, individuals do 500 pieces and then pairs normally do 1000

71
00:06:36,100 --> 00:06:39,900
 pieces. Yeah, yeah. We were a couple, I'm not trying

72
00:06:39,900 --> 00:06:44,420
 to frustrate on the jigsaw community, but we felt like we were the most attractive couple

73
00:06:44,420 --> 00:06:51,980
 at the jigsaw event. I'm sorry, but it was an older group. And we felt like we were really

74
00:06:51,980 --> 00:06:59,260
 young and dynamic. Like I was wearing a leather jacket and sunglasses. I was really playing

75
00:06:59,260 --> 00:07:03,660
 up to the sort of bad boy of jigsaw. The James Dean of jigsaws.

76
00:07:03,660 --> 00:07:05,540
 What everyone wants to know, Ian, is how you did?

77
00:07:05,540 --> 00:07:10,940
 Well, I think that's why I've tried to overcompensate at the beginning by saying we were the coolest

78
00:07:10,940 --> 00:07:21,860
 couple. We did not finish. We didn't finish. And we sort of snuck out because we were there

79
00:07:21,860 --> 00:07:26,900
 for three hours, and we had not done a lot of the jigsaw. And multiple people were already

80
00:07:26,900 --> 00:07:32,620
 standing up and sort of fist pumping. So we just sort of slowly slid it back into the

81
00:07:32,620 --> 00:07:37,580
 box and yeah, I went home. It was quite sad.

82
00:07:37,580 --> 00:07:42,940
 What's the vibe like, Ian? Is it like, if you make any noise, do you get tutted at and

83
00:07:42,940 --> 00:07:46,100
 stuff? It's very serious. Like everyone has a kitchen

84
00:07:46,100 --> 00:07:52,380
 spatula. Everyone except us. Is that for spanking their colleagues if they make a mistake or

85
00:07:52,380 --> 00:07:54,460
 they try and jam a piece in where it doesn't go?

86
00:07:54,460 --> 00:08:02,420
 It's a very racy event, actually. It's apparently to scoop the jigsaw pieces with more ease.

87
00:08:02,420 --> 00:08:08,220
 Because it's quite hard to pick them up. So they scoop in them. The table that won had

88
00:08:08,220 --> 00:08:14,060
 two electrolyte pouches on their table, like if you were running American. And we're like

89
00:08:14,060 --> 00:08:15,500
 doing them for energy.

90
00:08:15,500 --> 00:08:20,400
 If you didn't have a spatula, no wonder you took three hours and hadn't done any of it.

91
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:21,400
 We didn't have the tools.

92
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:26,420
 I can't see how a spatula would help though. I struggle getting an egg out of the frying

93
00:08:26,420 --> 00:08:31,180
 pan and not having the yolk break, let alone trying to get a single piece of jigsaw with

94
00:08:31,180 --> 00:08:33,260
 a spatula. That's a wild skill.

95
00:08:33,260 --> 00:08:37,900
 I think the thing is that if you've done like a cat and you've done the cat, okay, you need

96
00:08:37,900 --> 00:08:41,940
 to move the cat to another part of the table, then you don't want to pick it all up and

97
00:08:41,940 --> 00:08:42,940
 move it.

98
00:08:42,940 --> 00:08:47,020
 Beautiful. Okay, I get it now. Ian, you need to describe this better, mate.

99
00:08:47,020 --> 00:08:48,020
 I'm sorry.

100
00:08:48,020 --> 00:08:49,020
 That was kidding me.

101
00:08:49,020 --> 00:08:56,380
 I think I've only truly learned what the spatula is for right now. I thought it was just for

102
00:08:56,380 --> 00:09:01,220
 scooping, like clearing the table up. But as soon as you said that, I was like, "Yeah,

103
00:09:01,220 --> 00:09:03,700
 that is so clearly what that spatula is for."

104
00:09:03,700 --> 00:09:09,660
 It's such a shame that you didn't, because you know every year there's like, "Oh, this

105
00:09:09,660 --> 00:09:13,980
 guy, he tried to do the marathon and okay, he broke his leg halfway through or he didn't

106
00:09:13,980 --> 00:09:18,620
 do it, but he kept going and three days later, everyone's cheering him over the line and

107
00:09:18,620 --> 00:09:20,220
 that could have been you guys."

108
00:09:20,220 --> 00:09:24,340
 Yeah, still in the venue. Everyone's left. It's like a function room. There's probably

109
00:09:24,340 --> 00:09:29,540
 like another function on there now. It's just like a wedding going on. I'm like, "I'm so

110
00:09:29,540 --> 00:09:30,540
 close now."

111
00:09:30,540 --> 00:09:33,220
 Where did you do it, Ian?

112
00:09:33,220 --> 00:09:35,020
 This was in Newmarket.

113
00:09:35,020 --> 00:09:36,380
 Newmarket, right.

114
00:09:36,380 --> 00:09:42,860
 There was also a car and motorbike event in the same building and it was so easily definable

115
00:09:42,860 --> 00:09:44,980
 of like who was at which event.

116
00:09:44,980 --> 00:09:48,580
 Well, no, they'll have seen you Ian in your leather jacket and thought, "Oh, he's probably

117
00:09:48,580 --> 00:09:51,580
 here for the Harley-Davidson's."

118
00:09:51,580 --> 00:09:55,500
 Did you find that was the end of your career and you've not been able to look at a jigsaw

119
00:09:55,500 --> 00:09:59,060
 since or have you kept your hand in a little bit?

120
00:09:59,060 --> 00:10:04,580
 I haven't done a jigsaw since. Me and my girlfriend were between flats at the minute. We thought

121
00:10:04,580 --> 00:10:08,180
 we were going to be moving in a flat. It got delayed by a lot of times. So we're in like

122
00:10:08,180 --> 00:10:13,660
 Airbnbs for like a week at a time. And with the speed we do a jigsaw, that's not enough

123
00:10:13,660 --> 00:10:18,260
 time to set it up on a table and finish it.

124
00:10:18,260 --> 00:10:19,900
 Do you have a jig roll?

125
00:10:19,900 --> 00:10:27,700
 A jig roll? Is that like a Swiss roll jigsaw combination?

126
00:10:27,700 --> 00:10:33,900
 I was just trying to gauge how professional you are because it's like a bolt of cloth

127
00:10:33,900 --> 00:10:38,540
 that you do the jigsaw on. So you can keep a half-done puzzle on that and the pieces

128
00:10:38,540 --> 00:10:39,540
 stick to it.

129
00:10:39,540 --> 00:10:40,540
 I have one.

130
00:10:40,540 --> 00:10:41,540
 Do you?

131
00:10:41,540 --> 00:10:43,980
 Yeah, yeah. I've never done a jigsaw in my life, but I still have one.

132
00:10:43,980 --> 00:10:44,980
 You've got to be prepared.

133
00:10:44,980 --> 00:10:45,980
 Really?

134
00:10:45,980 --> 00:10:46,980
 You never know.

135
00:10:46,980 --> 00:10:51,260
 You've presumably got a spatula. James, you're halfway there to being the other one.

136
00:10:51,260 --> 00:10:56,300
 What's the difference between a jig roll and, say, your average bit of cloth?

137
00:10:56,300 --> 00:10:59,260
 I'll hand over to my colleague James here who's the other person.

138
00:10:59,260 --> 00:11:04,380
 I've never opened it, so I'm not really sure. But I think it's like slightly more stiff

139
00:11:04,380 --> 00:11:09,340
 than a piece of cloth. So you kind of roll it and it kind of keeps its form a bit more.

140
00:11:09,340 --> 00:11:10,340
 Oh, nice.

141
00:11:10,340 --> 00:11:15,160
 So it kind of holds the integrity of the jigsaw. But I think, like, I bought it for my wife

142
00:11:15,160 --> 00:11:18,980
 because one time she told me she liked jigsaws and I bought her a jigsaw and a jig roll

143
00:11:18,980 --> 00:11:22,340
 and it turned out she didn't like jigsaws after all.

144
00:11:22,340 --> 00:11:25,020
 I think that happens a lot.

145
00:11:25,020 --> 00:11:30,180
 I love the idea that James has a kind of potential hobby's chamber. It's this massive hangar

146
00:11:30,180 --> 00:11:33,620
 and it's full of everything he might possibly want to take up. Like, there's a paragliding

147
00:11:33,620 --> 00:11:37,020
 thing in there and there's like a golden backgammon set and all this.

148
00:11:37,020 --> 00:11:39,620
 Just in case at 2am someone mentions it.

149
00:11:39,620 --> 00:11:40,620
 Yeah.

150
00:11:40,620 --> 00:11:45,260
 They're really secretive at these competitions. So Ravensburger, who are, I think, the big

151
00:11:45,260 --> 00:11:47,420
 cheese of the jigsaw world, aren't they?

152
00:11:47,420 --> 00:11:54,980
 Gibson will try and say they're a big cheese as well, but Ravensburger, they've put them

153
00:11:54,980 --> 00:11:55,980
 in the ground.

154
00:11:55,980 --> 00:11:58,500
 They've cornered the market and edged the market.

155
00:11:58,500 --> 00:12:03,980
 Very strong, very strong. They will generate a new puzzle for every one of these competitions

156
00:12:03,980 --> 00:12:09,100
 and they're kept in top secret conditions in their laboratory in Bister.

157
00:12:09,100 --> 00:12:13,340
 People are so proud of their jigsaws. For example, there's a few charity shops down

158
00:12:13,340 --> 00:12:18,780
 in the area that I live in Margate. In every single one, I saw a giant framed finished

159
00:12:18,780 --> 00:12:22,500
 jigsaw that is just now a piece of art.

160
00:12:22,500 --> 00:12:23,500
 Yeah.

161
00:12:23,500 --> 00:12:29,060
 Dan, that has happened too. I think this is the largest puzzle ever made just two years

162
00:12:29,060 --> 00:12:36,220
 ago in Derbyshire. It's 120,000 pieces. It's 30 centimetres tall, but it's a third of a

163
00:12:36,220 --> 00:12:37,340
 mile long.

164
00:12:37,340 --> 00:12:43,260
 What is the image of? Because it's quite hard to think like a snake would fit in that kind

165
00:12:43,260 --> 00:12:45,060
 of aspect ratio or a worm.

166
00:12:45,060 --> 00:12:49,460
 It's a sausage. It's just a very, very long, very long sausage. Hard to do.

167
00:12:49,460 --> 00:12:50,460
 Wow.

168
00:12:50,460 --> 00:12:51,460
 And that's framed.

169
00:12:51,460 --> 00:12:56,060
 Oh, no, I'm thinking of a different one that was framed, which was 33,000 pieces, give

170
00:12:56,060 --> 00:13:00,820
 or take. And a man called Graham Andrew in Norfolk was trying to do it with a load of

171
00:13:00,820 --> 00:13:04,780
 volunteers like it was a real community effort. People would drop in and help. And as they

172
00:13:04,780 --> 00:13:10,300
 got to the end, they had the nightmare situation that Ian had that four pieces were missing.

173
00:13:10,300 --> 00:13:15,260
 And he had already thought of this. He had bought a second version of the puzzle just

174
00:13:15,260 --> 00:13:22,380
 in case. So they sifted through 33,000 pieces to find the missing four. Unfortunately, they

175
00:13:22,380 --> 00:13:26,100
 didn't quite fit because it wasn't exactly the same cut.

176
00:13:26,100 --> 00:13:27,100
 Oh, God.

177
00:13:27,100 --> 00:13:30,540
 And he said, Mr. Andrew said, I considered squishing them in, but decided it had to be

178
00:13:30,540 --> 00:13:35,820
 done properly. So I asked the company to re-cut them. So the Jigsaw company had to send out

179
00:13:35,820 --> 00:13:38,860
 like a specially print four pieces and send them out.

180
00:13:38,860 --> 00:13:40,180
 And it's done. It's all done.

181
00:13:40,180 --> 00:13:42,940
 It's done now. And that one has been framed and put up.

182
00:13:42,940 --> 00:13:51,900
 Do you think the volunteers he got in one of them thought it is funny to take a piece?

183
00:13:51,900 --> 00:13:57,860
 It's very cruel, but it would be really tempting to go, I'm going to help out for two hours.

184
00:13:57,860 --> 00:14:02,060
 I'm going to really do a decoy, but I'm pocketing two of these pieces.

185
00:14:02,060 --> 00:14:06,660
 It actually sounds like four people had that idea. And I can imagine them all going in

186
00:14:06,660 --> 00:14:10,820
 the pub afterwards, going, you did it as well, you did it as well.

187
00:14:10,820 --> 00:14:14,380
 There's one other cool Jigsaw that you can get your hands on, which I quite like. So

188
00:14:14,380 --> 00:14:22,420
 Jigsaw puzzler people, people who do it, there's a word that describes them, which is dissectologists.

189
00:14:22,420 --> 00:14:26,060
 So this was in the 18th century, when they were first made Jigsaws, they weren't called

190
00:14:26,060 --> 00:14:30,620
 Jigsaws. They were called dissected puzzles or dissected maps. So I guess you were putting

191
00:14:30,620 --> 00:14:35,940
 a dissected map back together. So you became a dissectologist. And in 1985, a guy called

192
00:14:35,940 --> 00:14:41,460
 Tom Tyler founded a club for Jigsaw puzzle lovers. And it's called the benevolent confraternity

193
00:14:41,460 --> 00:14:46,980
 of dissectologists. And this is a club that's still going to this day for Jigsaw.

194
00:14:46,980 --> 00:14:50,380
 I've, I've, I've, I've been, I've, I bought my wife membership.

195
00:14:50,380 --> 00:14:54,820
 No, oh my God. So you've got the exciting, did you get the exciting membership card?

196
00:14:54,820 --> 00:14:55,820
 Yeah.

197
00:14:55,820 --> 00:14:56,820
 Which is a Jigsaw.

198
00:14:56,820 --> 00:14:57,820
 Oh, yeah.

199
00:14:57,820 --> 00:15:01,580
 You know what? I thought buying my wife a Jigsaw and a Jigsaw, Matt was a really bad gift,

200
00:15:01,580 --> 00:15:05,860
 but this is awful, Andy.

201
00:15:05,860 --> 00:15:09,020
 We remain married.

202
00:15:09,020 --> 00:15:12,180
 You can't even, you can't even rip up your membership card in protest because you're

203
00:15:12,180 --> 00:15:15,660
 then just creating a fun puzzle.

204
00:15:15,660 --> 00:15:17,220
 Do you know why Jigsaws are called Jigsaws?

205
00:15:17,220 --> 00:15:21,180
 I could say you use a Jigsaw to cut them, presumably.

206
00:15:21,180 --> 00:15:26,020
 Well, that is it. Apart from when they were invented, the Jigsaw hadn't been invented

207
00:15:26,020 --> 00:15:27,020
 yet.

208
00:15:27,020 --> 00:15:28,020
 Right.

209
00:15:28,020 --> 00:15:33,740
 Now, they don't use Jigsaws anymore. Like they use lasers and stuff. So for a very short

210
00:15:33,740 --> 00:15:38,100
 amount of time, they did use Jigsaws and that was when they named it. But for most of the

211
00:15:38,100 --> 00:15:40,980
 start of their life and most of the end of life, you never use Jigsaws.

212
00:15:40,980 --> 00:15:44,140
 That's so funny. The Jigsaw is the one that goes up and down and up and down, isn't it?

213
00:15:44,140 --> 00:15:47,260
 And you push a bit of wood around in a shape and that.

214
00:15:47,260 --> 00:15:51,660
 And it's named after the fact that it looks like the saw is doing a little jig.

215
00:15:51,660 --> 00:15:52,660
 Right.

216
00:15:52,660 --> 00:15:53,660
 Right.

217
00:15:53,660 --> 00:15:54,660
 This is good. I didn't know that.

218
00:15:54,660 --> 00:15:55,660
 Do you propose?

219
00:15:55,660 --> 00:15:56,660
 That's very weird.

220
00:15:56,660 --> 00:15:58,780
 I would change their name now to Lasers.

221
00:15:58,780 --> 00:15:59,780
 Oh yeah.

222
00:15:59,780 --> 00:16:01,460
 I think more people would buy them.

223
00:16:01,460 --> 00:16:04,780
 In your sunglasses with your leather jacket in the front of the queue.

224
00:16:04,780 --> 00:16:06,300
 With my laser club membership.

225
00:16:06,300 --> 00:16:10,860
 Go down to laser quest, then go down to the laser club.

226
00:16:10,860 --> 00:16:14,860
 All right. Well, we need to wrap up. Ian, you're going to be up in Edinburgh, right?

227
00:16:14,860 --> 00:16:15,860
 With a new show.

228
00:16:15,860 --> 00:16:22,300
 Yeah. I'm doing a show. It's called Foot Spa Half Empty, which is partly because you've

229
00:16:22,300 --> 00:16:26,180
 got to name the show in January before you've written any of it.

230
00:16:26,180 --> 00:16:30,860
 But yeah, it's on at 12.30 in the afternoon at Monkey Barrel.

231
00:16:30,860 --> 00:16:35,500
 Yeah, I feel very excited about it. It's 20 minutes too long at the minute.

232
00:16:35,500 --> 00:16:38,500
 But I've got a bit of time to get rid of that.

233
00:16:38,500 --> 00:16:43,300
 But yeah, I'd love it if people could come along. Otherwise it would be sad if no one

234
00:16:43,300 --> 00:16:44,300
 else comes.

235
00:16:44,300 --> 00:16:55,500
 OK, it's time for fact number two, and that is Abby Howells.

236
00:16:55,500 --> 00:17:03,220
 My fact is in 1386, a pig was put on trial for murder.

237
00:17:03,220 --> 00:17:04,220
 OK.

238
00:17:04,220 --> 00:17:05,220
 What?

239
00:17:05,220 --> 00:17:06,220
 OK.

240
00:17:06,220 --> 00:17:13,700
 Yes, the pig was a bit naughty. It did more the child to dead.

241
00:17:13,700 --> 00:17:16,540
 Oh, wow. This got that quite quickly.

242
00:17:16,540 --> 00:17:22,260
 Yes, but I have one fun fact that will hopefully wind it up.

243
00:17:22,260 --> 00:17:29,580
 It was executed by a hanging, but they dressed the pig in human clothes to kill it.

244
00:17:29,580 --> 00:17:30,580
 Good stuff.

245
00:17:30,580 --> 00:17:33,900
 You're right. There's not there's not enough fun in execution, is there?

246
00:17:33,900 --> 00:17:39,740
 That sends a message that it can be done. Yeah, I mean, it's pretty grim, eh? Dressing

247
00:17:39,740 --> 00:17:41,780
 a pig up in a waistcoat and then hanging it.

248
00:17:41,780 --> 00:17:45,620
 Oh, come on, it's a funny image. Until the hanging, it's a funny image.

249
00:17:45,620 --> 00:17:50,860
 Can I make it even more grim? So she had six piglets and they were all put on trial as

250
00:17:50,860 --> 00:17:52,540
 accessories to murder.

251
00:17:52,540 --> 00:17:53,540
 What?

252
00:17:53,540 --> 00:17:54,540
 What?

253
00:17:54,540 --> 00:17:55,540
 That's really unfair.

254
00:17:55,540 --> 00:17:56,540
 And they were found guilty.

255
00:17:56,540 --> 00:18:01,420
 They were found guilty, but they were acquitted on grounds of youth and that the mother had

256
00:18:01,420 --> 00:18:03,300
 been a bad example to them.

257
00:18:03,300 --> 00:18:06,260
 OK, did they get a better lawyer for that bit of the trial?

258
00:18:06,260 --> 00:18:07,260
 Yeah.

259
00:18:07,260 --> 00:18:09,260
 Because clearly the first one didn't do a great job.

260
00:18:09,260 --> 00:18:13,140
 Yeah, the pig represented themselves and it was a mess.

261
00:18:13,140 --> 00:18:16,660
 Crazy, get a lawyer. No, it's fine.

262
00:18:16,660 --> 00:18:19,700
 This is my moment. I can't do this.

263
00:18:19,700 --> 00:18:24,620
 And then all else I found about it is the actual hanging as well. They had to give the hangman

264
00:18:24,620 --> 00:18:29,900
 a new pair of gloves. After it was part of his pay was that he would get a new pair of

265
00:18:29,900 --> 00:18:31,380
 gloves for doing the hanging.

266
00:18:31,380 --> 00:18:32,380
 This is crazy.

267
00:18:32,380 --> 00:18:37,260
 Yeah, although there was an article on JSTOR that said, and as they put it, the hangman

268
00:18:37,260 --> 00:18:42,980
 in this case, it was in a place called Filets, I think in France, the hangman is still owed

269
00:18:42,980 --> 00:18:45,940
 both for the execution and the new gloves.

270
00:18:45,940 --> 00:18:46,940
 Still?

271
00:18:46,940 --> 00:18:47,940
 Oh, what?

272
00:18:47,940 --> 00:18:48,940
 My gosh.

273
00:18:48,940 --> 00:18:51,900
 Yeah, he's turning in his grave waiting to be paid for this gruesome task because it's

274
00:18:51,900 --> 00:18:53,460
 not easy to dress a pig up.

275
00:18:53,460 --> 00:18:58,180
 It wasn't easy to be a hangman, to be honest, in those days. Like you would get your own

276
00:18:58,180 --> 00:19:02,860
 house and you'd get fed and you'd get loads of stuff, but no one was allowed to come near

277
00:19:02,860 --> 00:19:06,460
 you. No one was allowed to touch you. No one was allowed to talk to you. You'd be like

278
00:19:06,460 --> 00:19:09,860
 a special person in their town, but you'd be completely away.

279
00:19:09,860 --> 00:19:18,620
 Do you think that they are dressing the pig up? Who was ordering there? Was that the

280
00:19:18,620 --> 00:19:23,340
 hangman who was like, listen, I've got an idea. It sounds a little bit crazy.

281
00:19:23,340 --> 00:19:26,420
 I think maybe the local tailor.

282
00:19:26,420 --> 00:19:29,140
 Oh, a bit of advertising.

283
00:19:29,140 --> 00:19:32,620
 Yeah, then the local bluffmakers were like, I'm getting in on this as well.

284
00:19:32,620 --> 00:19:37,900
 Yeah, because a lot of people went to watch, so you've got a big audience there. I read

285
00:19:37,900 --> 00:19:43,340
 one account that they put a human face mask on the pig as well, but there's many accounts,

286
00:19:43,340 --> 00:19:48,020
 so it's hard to know which one necessarily to trust. But I was reading a long article

287
00:19:48,020 --> 00:19:52,500
 in the Medievalist, which is a site that talks about all the stuff that was happening

288
00:19:52,500 --> 00:19:58,700
 back then. They said that in the 12th and 13th century, that the reason a lot of animals

289
00:19:58,700 --> 00:20:03,180
 went on trial in this period. So something like 85 examples that we know of. The reason

290
00:20:03,180 --> 00:20:07,900
 they were happening was law suddenly became a bigger thing in more places around Europe,

291
00:20:07,900 --> 00:20:13,780
 and so there were way more lawyers than they had cases to deal with. And so they needed

292
00:20:13,780 --> 00:20:18,820
 to get practice. And so quite often a lot of lawyers would defend a pig and try and

293
00:20:18,820 --> 00:20:23,460
 get it off using new methods and like, oh, I tried this new thing out. The judge didn't

294
00:20:23,460 --> 00:20:27,500
 like it though. Damn it. Okay, I won't do that with humans. So it's just like a testing

295
00:20:27,500 --> 00:20:33,780
 ground. Because they did. They found cool ways of exonerating their clients, I guess.

296
00:20:33,780 --> 00:20:40,260
 There was a 1500s French lawyer called Chathane, who built his whole legal reputation on being

297
00:20:40,260 --> 00:20:45,500
 the counsel for rats that were on trial for destroying a field of barley. And first of

298
00:20:45,500 --> 00:20:50,020
 all, so they didn't turn up to court when they were summoned. And he found this thing

299
00:20:50,020 --> 00:20:55,180
 in the law that said that if you could plausibly have not seen the notice, then you don't need

300
00:20:55,180 --> 00:20:59,340
 to turn up. And he was like, these rats live in loads of different places. So then every

301
00:20:59,340 --> 00:21:04,620
 single parish council like within a 50 mile radius had to put like a big announcement

302
00:21:04,620 --> 00:21:08,620
 out saying, okay, all rats need to come to court on this date. And then when they still

303
00:21:08,620 --> 00:21:13,140
 didn't appear, the lawyer said, actually, there's a thing in the law that says if a

304
00:21:13,140 --> 00:21:19,300
 person sighted to appear at a court, but they can't come safely, they are allowed to refuse

305
00:21:19,300 --> 00:21:24,440
 to obey. And of course, these rats can't come safely because of the unwearyed vigilance

306
00:21:24,440 --> 00:21:29,500
 of their mortal enemies, the cats who are always waiting.

307
00:21:29,500 --> 00:21:34,540
 I was just wondering, like, you know, in terms of practicing law techniques and stuff, was

308
00:21:34,540 --> 00:21:39,340
 it all that showmanship, you know, the wrestle dazzle that we see, like, I've got a surprise

309
00:21:39,340 --> 00:21:48,740
 witness. He's like, a dog. And the dogs up there with like a cigarette, like, you'll

310
00:21:48,740 --> 00:21:50,140
 never crack me.

311
00:21:50,140 --> 00:21:55,620
 I was going, where did he get his suit? It's stunning. That tailor is good in this town.

312
00:21:55,620 --> 00:22:01,180
 I think one of the theory is that if you were a landowner, and let's say someone at all

313
00:22:01,180 --> 00:22:06,380
 your barley, some rats did, then you would want some money back for it. But you couldn't

314
00:22:06,380 --> 00:22:10,820
 do that unless there'd been some legal process and someone had been found guilty. And so

315
00:22:10,820 --> 00:22:14,660
 that's why these rats were put on trial so that the owners would get something.

316
00:22:14,660 --> 00:22:21,220
 Right. Abby, is this a personal interest of yours? Did you study animal law at uni?

317
00:22:21,220 --> 00:22:29,420
 Well, kind of. No. Well, I do. Okay. Here's, you know, here we go. I have a PhD. And my

318
00:22:29,420 --> 00:22:35,860
 PhD is on women in prison and the way they've portrayed in television, film and theatre.

319
00:22:35,860 --> 00:22:36,860
 Wow.

320
00:22:36,860 --> 00:22:42,020
 It's not a good PhD. I don't treat anyone to find it. It's ideally scraped in. Like when

321
00:22:42,020 --> 00:22:50,540
 I handed it in, they were like, you serious? And I was like, please. It's embarrassing

322
00:22:50,540 --> 00:22:58,340
 for us if you don't pass. But basically a big chunk of my thesis was on public executions

323
00:22:58,340 --> 00:23:03,980
 and like the spectacle of them because they were like, you know, that was the entertainment.

324
00:23:03,980 --> 00:23:08,220
 Like you'd be like, oh, Friday night. What are we going to do? Should we pop down? See

325
00:23:08,220 --> 00:23:13,060
 a lovely execution? Someone's been treasonous. Well, and if it's an animal being executed,

326
00:23:13,060 --> 00:23:16,860
 like that's even better. That's more Rapool, isn't it? Because it's still a bit more rare.

327
00:23:16,860 --> 00:23:22,340
 And you can have a barbecue afterwards. Yeah, I did wonder about that. Did they eat it?

328
00:23:22,340 --> 00:23:27,060
 It feels like in those days, you wouldn't want to waste a pig, even a naughty one.

329
00:23:27,060 --> 00:23:30,780
 Yeah. And one dressed so deshingly. Yeah.

330
00:23:30,780 --> 00:23:34,900
 And one of the theories as to why they did all this stuff is because it just showed that

331
00:23:34,900 --> 00:23:39,500
 the authorities were doing something, right? So all bad stuff's happening. People have

332
00:23:39,500 --> 00:23:44,260
 been, you know, lost the barley or their animals have killed people and they're like, okay,

333
00:23:44,260 --> 00:23:47,700
 well, we have to show that we're not just sitting back and letting this happen. So we're

334
00:23:47,700 --> 00:23:52,980
 going to put something on trial. And quite often, like if your barley got eaten or whatever,

335
00:23:52,980 --> 00:23:57,660
 it would be like all the mice are in trouble, but they would just pick one mouse and then

336
00:23:57,660 --> 00:24:02,220
 put like a show trial on for that one mouse. That's a fiddly job for the tailor, isn't

337
00:24:02,220 --> 00:24:07,580
 it? That's a challenging one. And probably a carpenter, presumably has to build a tiny

338
00:24:07,580 --> 00:24:12,080
 dock for it to go into. What a gig.

339
00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:16,300
 And I think people think maybe it didn't happen in England and Scotland and Wales. It was

340
00:24:16,300 --> 00:24:21,980
 just Western Europe, like Switzerland, France, Italy, because we had jury trials. This is

341
00:24:21,980 --> 00:24:27,340
 what a BBC documentary said. We had jury trials and it would be harder to, with a straight

342
00:24:27,340 --> 00:24:30,580
 face, present a full jury. Well, these cases,

343
00:24:30,580 --> 00:24:36,580
 your jury is supposed to be 12 equals, right? So you have to get, yeah, 12 pigs.

344
00:24:36,580 --> 00:24:40,740
 That's a chaotic courtroom, isn't it?

345
00:24:40,740 --> 00:24:45,780
 I'd love to know more about the hangman who, as was being mentioned before, is so isolated

346
00:24:45,780 --> 00:24:50,420
 from the rest of the community that they presumably are just told, you've got a job today, you've

347
00:24:50,420 --> 00:24:54,820
 got to kill someone. And they just keep rocking up. And he's like, what the fuck is this?

348
00:24:54,820 --> 00:25:02,860
 It's a mouse. Yeah, it's, we've sort of expanded your brief recently. Jesus, how am I gonna

349
00:25:02,860 --> 00:25:04,820
 get the noose around? No one prepared me for this.

350
00:25:04,820 --> 00:25:11,780
 There's actually this hangman in New Zealand. Like, we had a murderer called Minnie Dean.

351
00:25:11,780 --> 00:25:17,260
 And she's one of our most famous murderers that we have here in New Zealand. And she murdered

352
00:25:17,260 --> 00:25:21,780
 children and put them in head boxes. When was this?

353
00:25:21,780 --> 00:25:26,540
 I think like, maybe I want to say like late 1800s, early 1900s.

354
00:25:26,540 --> 00:25:28,740
 Oh, it was a long time ago.

355
00:25:28,740 --> 00:25:34,020
 Long time ago, yeah, yes. And she was found guilty and sentenced to execution. And they

356
00:25:34,020 --> 00:25:38,940
 could find no one to hang her. No one wanted to do it. But they had this guy that basically

357
00:25:38,940 --> 00:25:44,380
 had hung up his noose a long time ago. And then he'd gone to like live in the bush. And

358
00:25:44,380 --> 00:25:48,580
 they were like, we've got to get this guy. He's the only one. And then they found him

359
00:25:48,580 --> 00:25:53,180
 and he's like, I'll do it. But with one condition, I want to spend 30 minutes with her in the

360
00:25:53,180 --> 00:25:59,460
 room. And so he went and like spent 30 minutes with her. And then he was like, I'll do it.

361
00:25:59,460 --> 00:26:02,940
 So she must have been a punishing hang.

362
00:26:02,940 --> 00:26:04,500
 What happened in that 30 minutes?

363
00:26:04,500 --> 00:26:07,540
 No one knows what they talked about.

364
00:26:07,540 --> 00:26:08,540
 That's a film.

365
00:26:08,540 --> 00:26:09,540
 Yeah.

366
00:26:09,540 --> 00:26:13,660
 Yeah. Yeah, I'm sure I've, I'm some very mediocre play scripts have been read about

367
00:26:13,660 --> 00:26:20,260
 them. Pigs are still getting in trouble these days. Are they lots of naughty pigs around?

368
00:26:20,260 --> 00:26:25,660
 Well, I just remember that great story of how Peppa Pig had an episode banned in Australia

369
00:26:25,660 --> 00:26:30,180
 because she makes friends with a spider and they couldn't play that over there because

370
00:26:30,180 --> 00:26:35,420
 it taught young kids to go and walk up to because didn't she say like spiders are our

371
00:26:35,420 --> 00:26:38,340
 friends and they can't harm us or something like that?

372
00:26:38,340 --> 00:26:43,980
 Yeah. But I don't think Peppa's met a funnel web. So it's sort of a big, big problem over

373
00:26:43,980 --> 00:26:52,580
 in Oz. And I think in Korea, she was banned for it was like gangster related stuff.

374
00:26:52,580 --> 00:26:53,580
 What?

375
00:26:53,580 --> 00:26:54,580
 I haven't seen that episode.

376
00:26:54,580 --> 00:26:55,580
 I know.

377
00:26:55,580 --> 00:26:56,580
 I just pulled that from somewhere.

378
00:26:56,580 --> 00:26:58,740
 Is it because she has a different number of digits?

379
00:26:58,740 --> 00:26:59,740
 Yes.

380
00:26:59,740 --> 00:27:00,740
 Who was that?

381
00:27:00,740 --> 00:27:01,740
 That was banned.

382
00:27:01,740 --> 00:27:05,380
 Was that postman Pat or someone like that who got banned because they were like the Yakuza

383
00:27:05,380 --> 00:27:06,500
 with four fingers?

384
00:27:06,500 --> 00:27:10,340
 I know there's one episode of Bluey you can't watch in America.

385
00:27:10,340 --> 00:27:11,340
 Oh, yeah.

386
00:27:11,340 --> 00:27:12,340
 Why?

387
00:27:12,340 --> 00:27:13,340
 Can you guess why in fact?

388
00:27:13,340 --> 00:27:14,340
 Okay.

389
00:27:14,340 --> 00:27:20,620
 So we all know Bluey is the amazing kids show and it's about two dog parents and two dog

390
00:27:20,620 --> 00:27:21,620
 kids.

391
00:27:21,620 --> 00:27:22,620
 Yeah.

392
00:27:22,620 --> 00:27:30,900
 Anti gun, Bluey wants a gun and they say, no Bluey, no T, no guns.

393
00:27:30,900 --> 00:27:31,900
 It's close.

394
00:27:31,900 --> 00:27:32,900
 In fairness.

395
00:27:32,900 --> 00:27:36,620
 Oh, what else do Americans do? The death penalty. Was it death, the death penalty one where

396
00:27:36,620 --> 00:27:37,620
 they execute?

397
00:27:37,620 --> 00:27:38,620
 Yeah.

398
00:27:38,620 --> 00:27:39,620
 Bandit was executed.

399
00:27:39,620 --> 00:27:40,620
 Yeah.

400
00:27:40,620 --> 00:27:43,300
 No, it's not that.

401
00:27:43,300 --> 00:27:48,100
 What it is, is there's an episode where Bandit, who's the dad that gives birth or it looks

402
00:27:48,100 --> 00:27:50,980
 like he's giving birth to a baby.

403
00:27:50,980 --> 00:27:51,980
 Oh, yeah.

404
00:27:51,980 --> 00:27:56,220
 And it's not really happening, but it's, he kind of finds himself in this position where

405
00:27:56,220 --> 00:28:00,220
 he's laid down in a paddling pool and it looks like he's giving birth.

406
00:28:00,220 --> 00:28:06,140
 And I think in America, they thought that this wasn't evidence of like a typical family

407
00:28:06,140 --> 00:28:08,140
 because the man was giving birth.

408
00:28:08,140 --> 00:28:09,740
 But he wasn't giving birth.

409
00:28:09,740 --> 00:28:10,740
 No, he wasn't.

410
00:28:10,740 --> 00:28:11,740
 But like, it's not always.

411
00:28:11,740 --> 00:28:14,220
 You can't be lost in the plot of Bluey.

412
00:28:14,220 --> 00:28:18,220
 I guess when people complain about these things, they're not always completely using

413
00:28:18,220 --> 00:28:19,220
 excellent logic.

414
00:28:19,220 --> 00:28:20,220
 Their brains.

415
00:28:20,220 --> 00:28:21,220
 Yeah.

416
00:28:21,220 --> 00:28:23,340
 Putting in their head.

417
00:28:23,340 --> 00:28:25,500
 So animals are still a guang habi.

418
00:28:25,500 --> 00:28:31,820
 Well, with public executions, like kind of they were initially done to sort of demonstrate

419
00:28:31,820 --> 00:28:33,780
 like the power of the crown, right?

420
00:28:33,780 --> 00:28:37,220
 Like they would have, they were quite theatrical, like quite dramatic.

421
00:28:37,220 --> 00:28:43,940
 Like they would do stuff like, you know, someone receiving a pardon at the 11th hour and people

422
00:28:43,940 --> 00:28:48,620
 would broaden in a carriage, like all extremely performative.

423
00:28:48,620 --> 00:28:52,900
 And one of the reasons that public executions was phased out, there were many of them.

424
00:28:52,900 --> 00:28:59,020
 But because people were given the ability to say last words, people started really liking

425
00:28:59,020 --> 00:29:00,020
 the criminals.

426
00:29:00,020 --> 00:29:04,900
 So like they'd either be like, oh, no, I'm so sorry.

427
00:29:04,900 --> 00:29:07,300
 And they'd be like, oh, bloody hell, this, this seems better.

428
00:29:07,300 --> 00:29:09,100
 I wouldn't want to be executed.

429
00:29:09,100 --> 00:29:13,540
 Or they'd be sort of cavalier and be like, I did it and I do it again.

430
00:29:13,540 --> 00:29:17,300
 And then they sort of became like folk heroes.

431
00:29:17,300 --> 00:29:21,580
 So well, and it just leads me to think like, was the pink given an opportunity to give

432
00:29:21,580 --> 00:29:23,180
 some last words?

433
00:29:23,180 --> 00:29:28,260
 I'm trying to think what noise a pig could make to make the crowd go, oh, hang on, hang

434
00:29:28,260 --> 00:29:29,260
 on.

435
00:29:29,260 --> 00:29:30,260
 That's all folks.

436
00:29:30,260 --> 00:29:31,260
 Presumably.

437
00:29:31,260 --> 00:29:32,980
 You're right.

438
00:29:32,980 --> 00:29:36,300
 So animals are still getting arrested all around the world.

439
00:29:36,300 --> 00:29:37,300
 Oh yeah.

440
00:29:37,300 --> 00:29:43,540
 In Mumbai last year, there was a pigeon who was arrested because they had some Chinese

441
00:29:43,540 --> 00:29:48,580
 words written on their body and they thought it must be a spy.

442
00:29:48,580 --> 00:29:49,580
 What were the words?

443
00:29:49,580 --> 00:29:50,580
 Was it just?

444
00:29:50,580 --> 00:29:52,700
 Cook this side up or something?

445
00:29:52,700 --> 00:29:57,980
 No, it was more like sort of belonging to Taiwan Pigeon Racing Society.

446
00:29:57,980 --> 00:29:58,980
 Right.

447
00:29:58,980 --> 00:30:00,980
 But the people who captured it couldn't read it.

448
00:30:00,980 --> 00:30:05,380
 So they assumed it was what kind of planes were making it in India or something like

449
00:30:05,380 --> 00:30:06,380
 that.

450
00:30:06,380 --> 00:30:07,380
 Google translate, guys.

451
00:30:07,380 --> 00:30:08,380
 Just take a photo.

452
00:30:08,380 --> 00:30:09,380
 Google translate.

453
00:30:09,380 --> 00:30:10,380
 Just make sure.

454
00:30:10,380 --> 00:30:11,380
 Here's another one.

455
00:30:11,380 --> 00:30:17,260
 A few years ago, there were 14 squirrels arrested in Iran who were accused of espionage for

456
00:30:17,260 --> 00:30:18,260
 the United States.

457
00:30:18,260 --> 00:30:19,260
 Oh yeah.

458
00:30:19,260 --> 00:30:26,780
 And apparently what was said was that they had little sort of electronic devices on them.

459
00:30:26,780 --> 00:30:29,100
 Perhaps they were listening in or something like that.

460
00:30:29,100 --> 00:30:31,300
 And then we never really heard anything else about it.

461
00:30:31,300 --> 00:30:34,540
 A few journalists asked the head of police and he said, "Oh, I don't know anything about

462
00:30:34,540 --> 00:30:35,540
 that."

463
00:30:35,540 --> 00:30:41,420
 And basically experts have said that it would be a pretty stupid idea to use squirrels as

464
00:30:41,420 --> 00:30:45,860
 spies because they're extremely unreliable and they tend to just run off wherever they

465
00:30:45,860 --> 00:30:46,860
 want.

466
00:30:46,860 --> 00:30:49,660
 And many, many problems with using them as spies, I would say.

467
00:30:49,660 --> 00:30:50,660
 Yeah.

468
00:30:50,660 --> 00:30:51,660
 They have terrible memories, don't they?

469
00:30:51,660 --> 00:30:54,100
 Don't they bury their nuts and forget where they've buried them?

470
00:30:54,100 --> 00:30:55,860
 And that's how trees grow, basically.

471
00:30:55,860 --> 00:30:58,940
 That's how we have trees on our planet is just because squirrels don't know where dinner

472
00:30:58,940 --> 00:30:59,940
 has been buried.

473
00:30:59,940 --> 00:31:00,940
 Come on.

474
00:31:00,940 --> 00:31:02,140
 They bury a lot of nuts.

475
00:31:02,140 --> 00:31:06,500
 If you buried a thousand nuts, would you remember every single one's location, Dan?

476
00:31:06,500 --> 00:31:09,620
 I'd probably pick one location to put all my nuts in.

477
00:31:09,620 --> 00:31:12,140
 Well, that's your problem, Dan, isn't it?

478
00:31:12,140 --> 00:31:16,140
 That's like the Dan Shriver squirrel would have died out because it just takes one person

479
00:31:16,140 --> 00:31:19,420
 to find that cache of nuts and you have no nuts left.

480
00:31:19,420 --> 00:31:24,060
 Oh, they wouldn't find it and I would have a mega tree, the biggest tree ever.

481
00:31:24,060 --> 00:31:26,340
 Oh, my nuts combined.

482
00:31:26,340 --> 00:31:30,180
 Hey, I read just while I was reading up on pigs and seeing the trouble they get into

483
00:31:30,180 --> 00:31:34,660
 and so on, I came across something I've never heard of before, which is the pig toilet.

484
00:31:34,660 --> 00:31:35,660
 You guys heard of a pig toilet?

485
00:31:35,660 --> 00:31:38,100
 I don't know if I want to know, but go on.

486
00:31:38,100 --> 00:31:40,900
 I'll tell you, you don't, but I've got to say it anyway.

487
00:31:40,900 --> 00:31:47,620
 This is done in farms in China and other bits of Asia where pigs basically eat everything,

488
00:31:47,620 --> 00:31:49,540
 including human feces.

489
00:31:49,540 --> 00:31:56,100
 And so what it is is it's a toilet whereby a tube is attached where the feces goes down

490
00:31:56,100 --> 00:31:59,380
 and it lands in a big bowl for the pigs to eat.

491
00:31:59,380 --> 00:32:03,260
 It's their food bowl, basically, is the end of a human toilet.

492
00:32:03,260 --> 00:32:05,980
 It's a real thing, the pig toilet.

493
00:32:05,980 --> 00:32:08,660
 If that was me, I would maul a child to death.

494
00:32:08,660 --> 00:32:09,660
 Yeah.

495
00:32:09,660 --> 00:32:11,300
 That's what I'm saying.

496
00:32:11,300 --> 00:32:15,100
 If I was the defense lawyer, I'd open with that.

497
00:32:15,100 --> 00:32:16,940
 Maybe stop shitting in its food bowl.

498
00:32:16,940 --> 00:32:17,940
 Maybe.

499
00:32:17,940 --> 00:32:20,140
 Maybe that's the start of the problem.

500
00:32:20,140 --> 00:32:22,620
 It's the real animals here.

501
00:32:22,620 --> 00:32:24,620
 Yeah.

502
00:32:24,620 --> 00:32:25,620
 We need to wrap up.

503
00:32:25,620 --> 00:32:27,580
 Abby, tell us about your Edinburgh show.

504
00:32:27,580 --> 00:32:28,580
 Where are you going to be?

505
00:32:28,580 --> 00:32:29,580
 Hello.

506
00:32:29,580 --> 00:32:32,500
 Yes, I'm coming to Edinburgh all the way from New Zealand.

507
00:32:32,500 --> 00:32:33,500
 What the heck?

508
00:32:33,500 --> 00:32:36,620
 And I'm doing a show called Welcome to My Dream.

509
00:32:36,620 --> 00:32:42,020
 And I'm at Assembly in Studio 4 at 6.40 every single day.

510
00:32:42,020 --> 00:32:49,580
 And my show is about mainly, honestly, my enemies and people that have crossed me.

511
00:32:49,580 --> 00:32:54,460
 And I'm really brave and don't confront them to their face, but talk about it in a comedy

512
00:32:54,460 --> 00:32:55,460
 show.

513
00:32:55,460 --> 00:32:56,460
 On the other side of the world.

514
00:32:56,460 --> 00:32:57,460
 Yes.

515
00:32:57,460 --> 00:33:02,380
 My enemies include a local improv troupe and a museum of optical illusions that I'm in

516
00:33:02,380 --> 00:33:09,380
 a public queue with.

517
00:33:09,380 --> 00:33:17,340
 OK, it's time for fact number three, and that is Uruj Ashfaq.

518
00:33:17,340 --> 00:33:18,340
 Hi.

519
00:33:18,340 --> 00:33:23,500
 My fact is that emotional tears have more protein in them, so they fall slow.

520
00:33:23,500 --> 00:33:27,780
 And it's bi-designed so that our tribe can see us cry and comfort us.

521
00:33:27,780 --> 00:33:28,780
 Very clever.

522
00:33:28,780 --> 00:33:33,980
 I'm vaguely aware that there are different kinds of tears, but I didn't think they were

523
00:33:33,980 --> 00:33:36,260
 made of different things.

524
00:33:36,260 --> 00:33:40,080
 So there are three different types of tears.

525
00:33:40,080 --> 00:33:44,780
 There is basil, which is just the oily layer that we have on our eyelids to keep it from

526
00:33:44,780 --> 00:33:45,780
 drying out.

527
00:33:45,780 --> 00:33:50,620
 There's reflex, which is when we're cutting onions or there's some dust in our eyes.

528
00:33:50,620 --> 00:33:54,420
 So those fall really quickly to flesh away any irritants.

529
00:33:54,420 --> 00:33:59,340
 And then there are emotional tears, and they have the highest amount of protein levels,

530
00:33:59,340 --> 00:34:02,940
 so they fall slower, and they look more dramatic and sad.

531
00:34:02,940 --> 00:34:03,940
 So good.

532
00:34:03,940 --> 00:34:09,900
 I think it's amazing, and when you know this, you can see it, I think, like if you see someone

533
00:34:09,900 --> 00:34:13,740
 and there are tears coming down their face, the difference between, "Oh, I've got something

534
00:34:13,740 --> 00:34:18,260
 in my eye," and, "Oh, I'm really upset and I need to be comforted," you can actually

535
00:34:18,260 --> 00:34:19,940
 see them going slower down the face.

536
00:34:19,940 --> 00:34:20,940
 They seem more viscous.

537
00:34:20,940 --> 00:34:24,140
 I'm really going to look out for that.

538
00:34:24,140 --> 00:34:27,940
 So actually, we shouldn't say when people are upset, the tears were streaming down his

539
00:34:27,940 --> 00:34:28,940
 face.

540
00:34:28,940 --> 00:34:34,980
 We just say the tears were crawling slowly down his face, although I think with onions,

541
00:34:34,980 --> 00:34:39,020
 I kind of want sympathy when I'm cutting onions, I could do some slow tears to draw more attention

542
00:34:39,020 --> 00:34:40,020
 to it.

543
00:34:40,020 --> 00:34:42,060
 It doesn't say anywhere that you have to pick one.

544
00:34:42,060 --> 00:34:44,860
 You could just cry them all at the same time.

545
00:34:44,860 --> 00:34:47,380
 All three.

546
00:34:47,380 --> 00:34:55,700
 I was looking at the origins of why we cry due to emotion, and there's a theory, and

547
00:34:55,700 --> 00:34:56,700
 I love this so much.

548
00:34:56,700 --> 00:34:57,700
 It's by a Dutch psychologist.

549
00:34:57,700 --> 00:35:00,820
 He's called Advinge Hoortz, and he spent 20 years working on tears.

550
00:35:00,820 --> 00:35:05,660
 So he does, he knows his onions, sorry.

551
00:35:05,660 --> 00:35:12,620
 What he thinks is that it's an accident that we associate tears with emotion, right?

552
00:35:12,620 --> 00:35:18,220
 So when infants are wailing, because infants do naturally wail if they're in distress,

553
00:35:18,220 --> 00:35:22,220
 they will squeeze the muscles around their eyes as part of the wailing, and that puts

554
00:35:22,220 --> 00:35:28,260
 pressure on the eyeball so tears happened originally as a kind of reflex.

555
00:35:28,260 --> 00:35:31,780
 And then that became a signal of neediness by children, and we don't really control those

556
00:35:31,780 --> 00:35:35,780
 muscles, which is why it's relatively hard to fake crying.

557
00:35:35,780 --> 00:35:39,300
 And then it evolved naturally, because it turned out it was useful evolutionarily, because

558
00:35:39,300 --> 00:35:40,940
 people can see you crying, they comfort you.

559
00:35:40,940 --> 00:35:41,940
 I think that's it.

560
00:35:41,940 --> 00:35:42,940
 Yeah.

561
00:35:42,940 --> 00:35:43,940
 That's interesting.

562
00:35:43,940 --> 00:35:49,860
 Wouldn't it be nice if babies cried in like harmonies, but they always cry in this really

563
00:35:49,860 --> 00:35:53,020
 annoying discordant sound.

564
00:35:53,020 --> 00:35:57,940
 And of course, that is also an evolutionary thing, because if they made a nice tune when

565
00:35:57,940 --> 00:36:00,740
 they cried, no one would ever come to their help.

566
00:36:00,740 --> 00:36:05,540
 But the interesting thing is like that this sound that they make is actually very similar

567
00:36:05,540 --> 00:36:07,620
 to loads of different animals.

568
00:36:07,620 --> 00:36:11,380
 And loads of different animals make very similar crying sounds.

569
00:36:11,380 --> 00:36:16,700
 That's why when the foxes are having sex in my back garden, I think that my baby's upset.

570
00:36:16,700 --> 00:36:22,620
 Well, she doesn't like, she doesn't like to see that sort of thing.

571
00:36:22,620 --> 00:36:26,220
 And you do make us leap in the garden, so that's what I suppose all the time.

572
00:36:26,220 --> 00:36:31,360
 The really interesting thing is if you get the sound of a baby seal crying, for instance,

573
00:36:31,360 --> 00:36:36,420
 and you play that to a mother deer, then the deer will react as if it's one of her children

574
00:36:36,420 --> 00:36:38,420
 who's sick.

575
00:36:38,420 --> 00:36:44,260
 I wonder what would happen if you played me crying to a baby seal or a mother deer.

576
00:36:44,260 --> 00:36:47,680
 I think it's the same, because it's a very similar sound.

577
00:36:47,680 --> 00:36:52,100
 So they would think, and there's one theory that actually the reason that all everyone

578
00:36:52,100 --> 00:36:57,180
 evolved the same way is because then animals can help each other, but I don't, I think

579
00:36:57,180 --> 00:36:58,180
 that's it.

580
00:36:58,180 --> 00:36:59,180
 Well, who did that study?

581
00:36:59,180 --> 00:37:00,180
 Disney?

582
00:37:00,180 --> 00:37:01,180
 Come on.

583
00:37:01,180 --> 00:37:03,420
 Is that the Snow White Institute?

584
00:37:03,420 --> 00:37:07,060
 Arouge, are you familiar with Sad Bait?

585
00:37:07,060 --> 00:37:11,780
 I was reading about the specifically Indian phenomenon of crying videos where lots of

586
00:37:11,780 --> 00:37:15,380
 influencers will lip-sync and cry along to audio from movies.

587
00:37:15,380 --> 00:37:18,300
 And in about 2017, this was a huge deal.

588
00:37:18,300 --> 00:37:25,260
 I think you know more than me at this point, but I think the second acting showreel almost,

589
00:37:25,260 --> 00:37:26,260
 right?

590
00:37:26,260 --> 00:37:27,260
 Yes.

591
00:37:27,260 --> 00:37:29,900
 Is it a sad scene or is it like, you know, the song Prince Ali in Aladdin?

592
00:37:29,900 --> 00:37:30,900
 No, it's sad, it's sad.

593
00:37:30,900 --> 00:37:34,660
 It's like Bambi's mum dying or something.

594
00:37:34,660 --> 00:37:35,660
 People got famous.

595
00:37:35,660 --> 00:37:39,340
 I mean, there was a kid called Saga Goswami who set up a TikTok in 2017 and basically

596
00:37:39,340 --> 00:37:43,460
 became wealthy and famous off the back of crying along to images.

597
00:37:43,460 --> 00:37:44,460
 Yeah.

598
00:37:44,460 --> 00:37:45,460
 And the government banned it.

599
00:37:45,460 --> 00:37:46,460
 Yes.

600
00:37:46,460 --> 00:37:47,460
 The ban TikTok, yeah.

601
00:37:47,460 --> 00:37:49,900
 Did they ban it because of the crying videos?

602
00:37:49,900 --> 00:37:51,900
 They just thought this is a real downer.

603
00:37:51,900 --> 00:37:54,620
 This is bombing the whole country out.

604
00:37:54,620 --> 00:37:58,220
 Are you thinking this could be something where you could make your fortune, Andy?

605
00:37:58,220 --> 00:38:00,820
 Well, I'm always on the lookout for content.

606
00:38:00,820 --> 00:38:01,820
 You know me.

607
00:38:01,820 --> 00:38:02,820
 I'm content, content, content.

608
00:38:02,820 --> 00:38:06,860
 And I cry a lot, so let's marry these.

609
00:38:06,860 --> 00:38:09,820
 One of the problems with studying crying and its effect and tears in their effect is that

610
00:38:09,820 --> 00:38:13,140
 it's quite hard to make study participants cry on demand.

611
00:38:13,140 --> 00:38:16,260
 So do you guys think you could cry on demand?

612
00:38:16,260 --> 00:38:17,260
 I could.

613
00:38:17,260 --> 00:38:18,260
 Could you?

614
00:38:18,260 --> 00:38:19,260
 Really?

615
00:38:19,260 --> 00:38:20,260
 What would it take if they showed you a sad film?

616
00:38:20,260 --> 00:38:21,260
 You'd be up for it.

617
00:38:21,260 --> 00:38:22,260
 Yes.

618
00:38:22,260 --> 00:38:24,460
 Just let me be by myself for a bit.

619
00:38:24,460 --> 00:38:26,460
 I think I could get into it.

620
00:38:26,460 --> 00:38:31,300
 Gharuj will you always on the verge of tears anyway?

621
00:38:31,300 --> 00:38:34,100
 That actually makes me quite tense here now.

622
00:38:34,100 --> 00:38:37,740
 Have you ever done any acting, Gharuj, where you have to cry?

623
00:38:37,740 --> 00:38:41,260
 In my stand-up bits, I have a whole bit about crying, actually.

624
00:38:41,260 --> 00:38:45,500
 So I almost pretend to cry on stage and everyone was like, "Oh, my God, is she really going

625
00:38:45,500 --> 00:38:46,500
 to cry?"

626
00:38:46,500 --> 00:38:50,940
 And I said, "No, this is just yours and yours of practice."

627
00:38:50,940 --> 00:38:51,940
 What is your trick?

628
00:38:51,940 --> 00:38:53,900
 It's like you think of a sad thing or?

629
00:38:53,900 --> 00:38:54,900
 Yes.

630
00:38:54,900 --> 00:38:59,220
 I tend to really make myself cry, I think, of a sad thing, but otherwise, I just make

631
00:38:59,220 --> 00:39:04,860
 my crying face, which I have a lot of practice of, because I'd be honest, when you cry as

632
00:39:04,860 --> 00:39:09,060
 much as I do, you do end up looking in the mirror every once in a while, and you're like,

633
00:39:09,060 --> 00:39:10,900
 "What am I looking like right now?"

634
00:39:10,900 --> 00:39:13,300
 Have you ever done that?

635
00:39:13,300 --> 00:39:14,900
 Lots in the mirror and cried.

636
00:39:14,900 --> 00:39:15,900
 James is a glubber.

637
00:39:15,900 --> 00:39:18,980
 James lets on that he's one of the strong and silent types actually.

638
00:39:18,980 --> 00:39:22,100
 He's incredibly in touch with his feelings.

639
00:39:22,100 --> 00:39:23,100
 I am.

640
00:39:23,100 --> 00:39:25,540
 As soon as the zoom goes off, I'm going to be in the garden.

641
00:39:25,540 --> 00:39:28,540
 The foxes won't know what's going on.

642
00:39:28,540 --> 00:39:32,940
 I am interested by how people make other people cry, though, because there was quite a famous

643
00:39:32,940 --> 00:39:38,300
 study about how female tears make men less aggressive, which is quite interesting.

644
00:39:38,300 --> 00:39:45,580
 And they got 25 men to smell vials of tears that women had cried out, and they found that

645
00:39:45,580 --> 00:39:50,100
 they were 44% less aggressive in video games afterwards, whatever they were playing, Golden

646
00:39:50,100 --> 00:39:53,340
 Eye or Diddy Kong Racing or whatever.

647
00:39:53,340 --> 00:39:57,300
 And they got 100 women to come and donate tears, and only six of them could produce

648
00:39:57,300 --> 00:39:59,300
 the necessary amount.

649
00:39:59,300 --> 00:40:00,300
 Really?

650
00:40:00,300 --> 00:40:01,300
 Yeah.

651
00:40:01,300 --> 00:40:03,020
 So I really, you know, you could volunteer yourself for science, Erush.

652
00:40:03,020 --> 00:40:04,020
 That would be great.

653
00:40:04,020 --> 00:40:09,960
 And I'm always crying because of men anyway, so it's like a full circle.

654
00:40:09,960 --> 00:40:15,780
 I was looking into what makes Americans cry, and the circumstances under which they cry.

655
00:40:15,780 --> 00:40:21,540
 Have you ever cried at home, at a funeral, in your car, that kind of stuff?

656
00:40:21,540 --> 00:40:25,580
 I mean, all of it, in every single category, women say they cry more than men, or have

657
00:40:25,580 --> 00:40:27,940
 cried more than men in that circumstance.

658
00:40:27,940 --> 00:40:32,420
 But the top five reasons that Americans say would make them cry would be the death of

659
00:40:32,420 --> 00:40:37,980
 a loved one, the death of a pet, feeling extremely sad, saying goodbye to a loved one before a

660
00:40:37,980 --> 00:40:41,620
 long separation, and chopping onions.

661
00:40:41,620 --> 00:40:45,860
 And then chopping onions came before speaking about an emotional subject, watching a sad

662
00:40:45,860 --> 00:40:49,180
 movie, and witnessing injustice or cruelty.

663
00:40:49,180 --> 00:40:52,900
 It could be that they just really like onions.

664
00:40:52,900 --> 00:40:54,460
 What about sporting events?

665
00:40:54,460 --> 00:40:56,660
 That's the only time when I feel emotional, really.

666
00:40:56,660 --> 00:41:00,940
 Oh yeah, actually, the Wimbledon Women's Tennis Final, I was almost crying along in sympathy

667
00:41:00,940 --> 00:41:01,940
 this year.

668
00:41:01,940 --> 00:41:04,760
 That was a tough watch.

669
00:41:04,760 --> 00:41:13,060
 I read that in 17th century America, if the bride didn't cry, like furiously cry, when

670
00:41:13,060 --> 00:41:18,360
 she was getting married, they would accuse her of being a witch, because they believed

671
00:41:18,360 --> 00:41:23,040
 that a witch could only shed three tears at a time through her left eye.

672
00:41:23,040 --> 00:41:24,040
 Oh wow.

673
00:41:24,040 --> 00:41:25,040
 It's so specific.

674
00:41:25,040 --> 00:41:27,660
 So not only do you have to cry, you've got to make sure that right eye cries.

675
00:41:27,660 --> 00:41:28,660
 Yes.

676
00:41:28,660 --> 00:41:30,440
 I mean, the wedding is a happy occasion.

677
00:41:30,440 --> 00:41:31,640
 Should you be sobbing your heart out?

678
00:41:31,640 --> 00:41:33,520
 Tears of happiness, Anna.

679
00:41:33,520 --> 00:41:34,520
 Tears of happiness.

680
00:41:34,520 --> 00:41:35,520
 Yeah.

681
00:41:35,520 --> 00:41:38,440
 I think to be safe, you'd have to make sure you married an absolute bastard so you could

682
00:41:38,440 --> 00:41:40,520
 guarantee crying on your wedding day.

683
00:41:40,520 --> 00:41:43,840
 Have you guys heard of tear catchers?

684
00:41:43,840 --> 00:41:45,000
 These are really cool.

685
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:46,000
 No.

686
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:47,000
 No.

687
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:50,200
 So they're a little bit of glass that you put underneath your eyes.

688
00:41:50,200 --> 00:41:54,640
 They first made in ancient Persia, but the Romans had them as well.

689
00:41:54,640 --> 00:42:00,720
 And the idea was, let's say I went away on a trip, we were touring Australia or something,

690
00:42:00,720 --> 00:42:05,040
 I would give my wife one of these and she would keep it underneath her eyes.

691
00:42:05,040 --> 00:42:09,200
 And then when I came back, I'd be able to see how many tears she'd made because she

692
00:42:09,200 --> 00:42:11,200
 was so upset that I was on top.

693
00:42:11,200 --> 00:42:12,200
 Come on.

694
00:42:12,200 --> 00:42:14,520
 How many wives desperately filling it up with a tap?

695
00:42:14,520 --> 00:42:18,240
 But that was a real thing and even the Victorians had them.

696
00:42:18,240 --> 00:42:21,880
 So you know, we're quite unusual that we don't have them.

697
00:42:21,880 --> 00:42:24,860
 So I was looking at like, you know, crying behaviors around the world in different cultures

698
00:42:24,860 --> 00:42:31,560
 and the bow people of the Andaman Islands, who I think do not exist anymore, but they

699
00:42:31,560 --> 00:42:35,800
 used to until the early 20th century in the late 1800s.

700
00:42:35,800 --> 00:42:40,440
 If you were separated from your bow friend or family member for a long time, when you

701
00:42:40,440 --> 00:42:46,720
 were reunited, the way that you celebrated that is you sat apart and completely ignored

702
00:42:46,720 --> 00:42:50,520
 each other for like a full day, hours and hours, a full day.

703
00:42:50,520 --> 00:42:54,620
 And then as soon as dusk fell, you turned around and you flung your arms around each

704
00:42:54,620 --> 00:42:56,740
 other and you cried for an hour.

705
00:42:56,740 --> 00:42:57,740
 Wow.

706
00:42:57,740 --> 00:42:58,740
 Interesting.

707
00:42:58,740 --> 00:42:59,740
 Yeah.

708
00:42:59,740 --> 00:43:01,740
 Very, very choreographed reunion.

709
00:43:01,740 --> 00:43:06,620
 It's a bit like coming home to a dog, though, isn't it, which you've not seen for a while.

710
00:43:06,620 --> 00:43:10,340
 They will pretend for a while, they hate that you can.

711
00:43:10,340 --> 00:43:17,780
 Anna, can I ask if after about 56 minutes of you crying, is it a faux pas to be checking

712
00:43:17,780 --> 00:43:21,960
 your watch?

713
00:43:21,960 --> 00:43:23,440
 Yeah, I think you're in serious trouble.

714
00:43:23,440 --> 00:43:25,080
 I think you kicked off the island.

715
00:43:25,080 --> 00:43:28,280
 Do you know that tears are like fingerprints?

716
00:43:28,280 --> 00:43:33,760
 So everyone has completely different tears, but that's very rarely useful in a burglary

717
00:43:33,760 --> 00:43:34,760
 investigation.

718
00:43:34,760 --> 00:43:38,520
 That's why I always leave Bambion when I leave the house.

719
00:43:38,520 --> 00:43:42,000
 I just make sure that any burglars had a bit of a week.

720
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:46,400
 But yeah, because they all have different organic substances, different molecular makeup.

721
00:43:46,400 --> 00:43:51,820
 You could just plant evidence then, you just make somebody cry, collect their tears and

722
00:43:51,820 --> 00:43:54,420
 then leave it at the scene of the crime.

723
00:43:54,420 --> 00:43:55,420
 Really good idea.

724
00:43:55,420 --> 00:43:56,420
 Yeah.

725
00:43:56,420 --> 00:44:00,060
 I think we'll edit this so I can actually use it in real life and they can't trace

726
00:44:00,060 --> 00:44:04,260
 it back to me.

727
00:44:04,260 --> 00:44:05,500
 Mouse tears are erotic.

728
00:44:05,500 --> 00:44:07,860
 Oh yeah, I always said it.

729
00:44:07,860 --> 00:44:10,180
 Yeah, look, we all knew it.

730
00:44:10,180 --> 00:44:12,740
 It's two other mice, but it is quite cool.

731
00:44:12,740 --> 00:44:18,720
 These male mouse tears, so they cry and they lubricate their eyebrows.

732
00:44:18,720 --> 00:44:20,720
 Her eyebrows?

733
00:44:20,720 --> 00:44:21,720
 No?

734
00:44:21,720 --> 00:44:22,720
 Their eyeballs.

735
00:44:22,720 --> 00:44:26,120
 Everyone loves a wet eyebrow.

736
00:44:26,120 --> 00:44:29,480
 And then they spread their tears around their body and they groom themselves with them.

737
00:44:29,480 --> 00:44:33,240
 And they found out that if a male mouse is crying and spreading its tears around its body

738
00:44:33,240 --> 00:44:38,280
 and the female mouse comes into contact with it, she will engage in laudosis, which has

739
00:44:38,280 --> 00:44:42,280
 always been one of my favorite words, which is where a female mouse or animal raises their

740
00:44:42,280 --> 00:44:49,520
 rump up to say, do come in.

741
00:44:49,520 --> 00:44:52,820
 You have that on the little mat outside your front door, don't you, Anna?

742
00:44:52,820 --> 00:44:56,220
 The picture of me just bending over my bum out.

743
00:44:56,220 --> 00:44:57,220
 Yeah.

744
00:44:57,220 --> 00:45:01,740
 That's sort of refreshing because men have the opposite reaction to my tears.

745
00:45:01,740 --> 00:45:02,740
 They leave.

746
00:45:02,740 --> 00:45:04,780
 They're like, bye, this is good.

747
00:45:04,780 --> 00:45:07,220
 No, that's them showing you their bottom.

748
00:45:07,220 --> 00:45:08,220
 You've just misinterpreted.

749
00:45:08,220 --> 00:45:13,640
 You know, they're saying, all right, we should wrap up.

750
00:45:13,640 --> 00:45:18,960
 But before you go, Arouge, I believe you're going to be in Edinburgh and not just hanging

751
00:45:18,960 --> 00:45:20,960
 out there doing a show, correct?

752
00:45:20,960 --> 00:45:21,960
 Yes.

753
00:45:21,960 --> 00:45:23,280
 I'm doing my solo show.

754
00:45:23,280 --> 00:45:30,280
 It's called How to be a Baddie from 30th July to 24th August, 625 p.m. at the Monkey

755
00:45:30,280 --> 00:45:31,280
 Barrel.

756
00:45:31,280 --> 00:45:36,080
 I will be a bad girl at the fringe this August.

757
00:45:36,080 --> 00:45:38,040
 Thank you so much for coming on.

758
00:45:38,040 --> 00:45:39,040
 Great to talk crying.

759
00:45:39,040 --> 00:45:43,660
 We're all sobbing now, obviously.

760
00:45:43,660 --> 00:45:52,100
 OK, it's time for our final fact of the show, and that is Nish Kumar.

761
00:45:52,100 --> 00:45:58,700
 In 1967, for eight dates, Jimi Hendrix supported the Monkeys on tour in the United States

762
00:45:58,700 --> 00:45:59,700
 of America.

763
00:45:59,700 --> 00:46:03,860
 What a privilege for him.

764
00:46:03,860 --> 00:46:07,900
 I was trying to come up with an analogy of who it's like supporting whom these days.

765
00:46:07,900 --> 00:46:13,720
 Is it like Leonard Cohen supporting Sabrina Carpenter or something?

766
00:46:13,720 --> 00:46:18,760
 Maybe it's like Kendrick Lamar opening for the Wiggles or something.

767
00:46:18,760 --> 00:46:22,680
 Maybe we're being a tad unkind to the Monkeys, who did, you know, in spite of the fact that

768
00:46:22,680 --> 00:46:27,560
 they were sort of a confected band for a television show, definitely had sort of some musical

769
00:46:27,560 --> 00:46:31,200
 talent, not that I'm denigrating the musicianship of the Wiggles.

770
00:46:31,200 --> 00:46:32,200
 Thank you.

771
00:46:32,200 --> 00:46:34,360
 I was biting my tongue there, but yeah.

772
00:46:34,360 --> 00:46:35,360
 Kendrick and the Wiggles.

773
00:46:35,360 --> 00:46:36,360
 Are you kidding me?

774
00:46:36,360 --> 00:46:37,360
 I'm just kidding.

775
00:46:37,360 --> 00:46:41,060
 So, who is this Jimi Hendrix guy?

776
00:46:41,060 --> 00:46:42,540
 I think we should get into that.

777
00:46:42,540 --> 00:46:43,540
 Yeah.

778
00:46:43,540 --> 00:46:44,980
 Who the hell is this Jimi Hendrix man?

779
00:46:44,980 --> 00:46:45,980
 Yes.

780
00:46:45,980 --> 00:46:48,100
 And actually, he wasn't the biggest thing in the world then, was he?

781
00:46:48,100 --> 00:46:49,100
 No.

782
00:46:49,100 --> 00:46:50,100
 In 1967.

783
00:46:50,100 --> 00:46:51,100
 Yeah.

784
00:46:51,100 --> 00:46:55,420
 He did this famous performance at the Monterey Festival of Pop, because he is American, had

785
00:46:55,420 --> 00:47:01,420
 been in America for years and years, then in '66, he's performing on his own after having

786
00:47:01,420 --> 00:47:05,740
 spent a couple of years as a kind of sideman playing in clubs across the South.

787
00:47:05,740 --> 00:47:10,760
 He's then in Greenwich Village performing kind of with backup musicians, but on his own at

788
00:47:10,760 --> 00:47:16,280
 the cafe where in New York, Chaz Chandler, the recently ex-bassist of the animals, sees

789
00:47:16,280 --> 00:47:21,140
 Hendrix and thinks, right, I'm taking this guy to England, I'm going to find two British

790
00:47:21,140 --> 00:47:25,300
 musicians to back him up in London, and then we're going to put together a band.

791
00:47:25,300 --> 00:47:26,440
 That happens.

792
00:47:26,440 --> 00:47:31,240
 And then from total obscurity, he becomes the hottest thing in London.

793
00:47:31,240 --> 00:47:33,640
 McCartney recommends him to the Monterey Festival of Pop.

794
00:47:33,640 --> 00:47:37,900
 He then goes to the Monterey Festival of Pop and sort of gives one of the kind of seminal

795
00:47:37,900 --> 00:47:44,060
 performances in the development of popular music, because he, you know, he's a fusion

796
00:47:44,060 --> 00:47:49,380
 of psychedelic rock and a lot of that was accelerated by new guitar pedal effects that

797
00:47:49,380 --> 00:47:53,060
 were coming through that he was often the first person to actually have access to.

798
00:47:53,060 --> 00:47:59,580
 But he creates this kind of sound that fuses psychedelic rock with some very, very traditional

799
00:47:59,580 --> 00:48:01,860
 orthodox blues music.

800
00:48:01,860 --> 00:48:05,000
 And you know, he's dressed in a way that no rock star has dressed.

801
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:11,400
 And then at the end of this performance, he does a cover of Wild Thing by the Trugs,

802
00:48:11,400 --> 00:48:15,480
 and then he sets fire to and destroys his guitar on stage.

803
00:48:15,480 --> 00:48:17,480
 Oh, is that the moment?

804
00:48:17,480 --> 00:48:21,880
 The performance is extraordinary, because also, you know, it's a hippie crowd.

805
00:48:21,880 --> 00:48:25,400
 They sort of, when he sings, he's got a very beautiful, delicate song called "The Wind

806
00:48:25,400 --> 00:48:26,400
 cries Mary."

807
00:48:26,400 --> 00:48:30,000
 And the hippie crowd is very enchanted, and then people are just very quickly horrified

808
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:35,080
 as he lets not be around the bush, simulates sex with his guitar for an uncomfortably long

809
00:48:35,080 --> 00:48:36,080
 amount of time.

810
00:48:36,080 --> 00:48:39,660
 And then sets it on fire and smashes it on the stage.

811
00:48:39,660 --> 00:48:44,860
 And the monkeys are watching, and they think, "This is the support act we've been looking

812
00:48:44,860 --> 00:48:47,940
 for for when we played Last Train to Clarksville."

813
00:48:47,940 --> 00:48:51,820
 Well, Mickey Delence, who's in the monkeys, that was the second time he saw him.

814
00:48:51,820 --> 00:48:57,300
 So he actually saw Hendrix in America, Greenwich Village, I think, and he saw him playing with

815
00:48:57,300 --> 00:48:58,300
 his teeth.

816
00:48:58,300 --> 00:49:00,160
 That was amazing, but he didn't get his name.

817
00:49:00,160 --> 00:49:02,640
 So when they were at the gig, they were like, "He was like, "That's the teeth guy.

818
00:49:02,640 --> 00:49:04,320
 We've got to get him."

819
00:49:04,320 --> 00:49:07,920
 And to be fair to the monkeys, they knew their place in rock music, and they knew what his

820
00:49:07,920 --> 00:49:09,820
 emerging place might be.

821
00:49:09,820 --> 00:49:15,000
 They thought, "Won't it be awesome to get to watch Jimi Hendrix every night on tour?"

822
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:16,000
 That's what they wanted.

823
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:17,480
 You said it was for seven or eight nights.

824
00:49:17,480 --> 00:49:20,600
 So presumably, this was not one of the great marriages of the orchestra.

825
00:49:20,600 --> 00:49:26,360
 No, so it sort of became quite quickly apparent that this was a mismatch, even though, as you

826
00:49:26,360 --> 00:49:32,700
 say, Dan, the monkeys were real Hendrix fans, and so would often sneak into the audience

827
00:49:32,700 --> 00:49:39,860
 just so that they could watch him perform to an audience of monkeys fans who were increasingly

828
00:49:39,860 --> 00:49:40,860
 frustrated.

829
00:49:40,860 --> 00:49:46,900
 Well, apparently, one of the things that is said about the concert is that when he tried

830
00:49:46,900 --> 00:49:53,220
 to get them to sing "Foxy Lady," they would yell back "Foxy Davy," after Davy Jones,

831
00:49:53,220 --> 00:49:55,980
 one of the members of the monkeys.

832
00:49:55,980 --> 00:49:59,880
 Yeah, it was not a solid artistic match.

833
00:49:59,880 --> 00:50:04,940
 But also, Hendrix had some experience of doing this kind of thing, because he had opened

834
00:50:04,940 --> 00:50:11,180
 for Engelbert Humperding in England the year before, because, you know, I guess at various

835
00:50:11,180 --> 00:50:16,040
 points you're sort of, you know, especially at that time where the kind of touring circuit

836
00:50:16,040 --> 00:50:20,960
 was just starting, there just weren't that many musicians that fit into the category

837
00:50:20,960 --> 00:50:22,400
 of popular music.

838
00:50:22,400 --> 00:50:28,780
 We hadn't yet managed to silo everything off by Jobra, but I think the issue is almost

839
00:50:28,780 --> 00:50:34,860
 that the monkeys' audience was children and their parents, and I think that that is the

840
00:50:34,860 --> 00:50:39,060
 thing that kind of, that's the thing that creates the issue.

841
00:50:39,060 --> 00:50:44,540
 And he wasn't a big fan, apparently he referred to their music as dishwater, so that's not

842
00:50:44,540 --> 00:50:46,700
 the best compliment, if true.

843
00:50:46,700 --> 00:50:52,800
 So he's looking down, he disdains this audience so much who disdain him in return, and then

844
00:50:52,800 --> 00:50:55,520
 they basically shout each other off the stage, don't they?

845
00:50:55,520 --> 00:50:59,040
 He just eventually said, "Sod this, these guys hate me, I hate them."

846
00:50:59,040 --> 00:51:00,040
 Really?

847
00:51:00,040 --> 00:51:04,640
 Yeah, listen, I'll say this from personal experience, I know what it's like to have

848
00:51:04,640 --> 00:51:05,640
 a bad gig.

849
00:51:05,640 --> 00:51:12,080
 I've had a few bad gigs in my time, and I know what it looks like when an audience

850
00:51:12,080 --> 00:51:17,660
 turns on a performer, and let me tell you, it's not pretty when it's 30 people, but I

851
00:51:17,660 --> 00:51:20,280
 imagine when it's 10,000 people.

852
00:51:20,280 --> 00:51:27,160
 Yeah, those Wiggles crowds are tough, man, they are hard to win over.

853
00:51:27,160 --> 00:51:31,220
 You know you mentioned the "Wing cries Mary," which, I agree, is a really lovely song.

854
00:51:31,220 --> 00:51:35,200
 I didn't realise what that was about, and it's just about lumpy mashed potato.

855
00:51:35,200 --> 00:51:36,200
 Is it?

856
00:51:36,200 --> 00:51:37,200
 Stop it.

857
00:51:37,200 --> 00:51:41,820
 Yeah, it's just about he had a fight with his girlfriend, Kathy Mary Etchingham, apparently

858
00:51:41,820 --> 00:51:45,760
 they had fights a lot, and again, you always picture some like Jimi Hendrix, they've got

859
00:51:45,760 --> 00:51:49,480
 to be having these really passionate fights about huge issues.

860
00:51:49,480 --> 00:51:55,280
 No, the thing they always thought about was her shit cooking, and in 1967, he had a big

861
00:51:55,280 --> 00:51:57,840
 bitch about her lumpy mashed potatoes.

862
00:51:57,840 --> 00:52:01,920
 She stormed out, smashed some plates, and the "Wing cries Mary" is the song he wrote

863
00:52:01,920 --> 00:52:02,920
 that night.

864
00:52:02,920 --> 00:52:09,120
 It has the lyric about picking up broken pieces on the floor and sweeping up the bits of plate.

865
00:52:09,120 --> 00:52:10,800
 There we go, that's all it is.

866
00:52:10,800 --> 00:52:11,800
 That's great.

867
00:52:11,800 --> 00:52:13,740
 Nish, I'm taking you're a mega fan, right?

868
00:52:13,740 --> 00:52:15,300
 From everything you've said so far.

869
00:52:15,300 --> 00:52:18,300
 Yeah, I'm a big Jimi Hendrix fan.

870
00:52:18,300 --> 00:52:22,300
 So the first album I ever bought was a Jimi Hendrix album, which was great.

871
00:52:22,300 --> 00:52:24,260
 That's a great first album to have bought.

872
00:52:24,260 --> 00:52:31,340
 The first single was "Bewitched," so I thought, "Wow, it's a mixed grill, my taste."

873
00:52:31,340 --> 00:52:34,340
 Oh, the monkey's kind of influenced that.

874
00:52:34,340 --> 00:52:35,340
 Yeah.

875
00:52:35,340 --> 00:52:38,340
 But the thing I love and the thing I never knew, and I find this really interesting because

876
00:52:38,340 --> 00:52:42,520
 it's my other area of interest, is that he was a paratrooper.

877
00:52:42,520 --> 00:52:48,600
 He was signed into the US Army, the 101st Airborne Division of the US Army, because there was

878
00:52:48,600 --> 00:52:51,840
 a minor misdemeanor and the judge said, "Well, you've got to join the Army if you want to

879
00:52:51,840 --> 00:52:53,080
 avoid prison."

880
00:52:53,080 --> 00:53:00,000
 So theoretically, if the TV series Band of Brothers had been set not in 1944, but in

881
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:06,440
 the early '60s, Jimi Hendrix could have been a character in that series.

882
00:53:06,440 --> 00:53:09,420
 A fantasy world you can both inhabit.

883
00:53:09,420 --> 00:53:14,260
 Yeah, but you know the plotline to that would then involve the truth, which is that he then

884
00:53:14,260 --> 00:53:16,580
 pretends to be gay to get out of it.

885
00:53:16,580 --> 00:53:17,580
 Yes.

886
00:53:17,580 --> 00:53:18,580
 He was dishonorably discharged.

887
00:53:18,580 --> 00:53:19,580
 Yeah.

888
00:53:19,580 --> 00:53:23,520
 For a comic subplot in Band of Brothers, which gets a bit heavy at times, I would say.

889
00:53:23,520 --> 00:53:26,580
 Here's a thing that I was surprised about with Jimi Hendrix.

890
00:53:26,580 --> 00:53:31,380
 He's obviously the epitome of cool, of psychedelia, of that whole period.

891
00:53:31,380 --> 00:53:35,340
 But when you read into him, actually quite sort of a mundane, boring character.

892
00:53:35,340 --> 00:53:36,920
 He loved playing risk.

893
00:53:36,920 --> 00:53:41,000
 Graham Nash of Crosby Stills and Nash said that he was amazing at risk, particularly

894
00:53:41,000 --> 00:53:42,920
 when he was on LSD.

895
00:53:42,920 --> 00:53:44,600
 That's his military experience coming in.

896
00:53:44,600 --> 00:53:45,600
 It is.

897
00:53:45,600 --> 00:53:46,760
 It's like, "No, I wouldn't go that way."

898
00:53:46,760 --> 00:53:47,760
 Yeah.

899
00:53:47,760 --> 00:53:48,760
 Straight ahead of five of you.

900
00:53:48,760 --> 00:53:53,400
 But he was also a massive fan of Coronation Street.

901
00:53:53,400 --> 00:53:54,400
 Like a huge fan.

902
00:53:54,400 --> 00:53:55,400
 Really?

903
00:53:55,400 --> 00:53:56,400
 Yeah.

904
00:53:56,400 --> 00:53:59,680
 So, according to his girlfriend, who you mentioned, and Kathy.

905
00:53:59,680 --> 00:54:00,680
 Kathy, yeah.

906
00:54:00,680 --> 00:54:01,680
 Yeah.

907
00:54:01,680 --> 00:54:03,640
 She says that he just absolutely binged Coronation Street.

908
00:54:03,640 --> 00:54:08,860
 And there's a theory that the theme tune found its way into one of his songs.

909
00:54:08,860 --> 00:54:12,540
 And if you listen, and I've had to listen just before we came on, on Axis Baldur's

910
00:54:12,540 --> 00:54:16,260
 Love, there is a song called Third Stone from the Sun.

911
00:54:16,260 --> 00:54:17,260
 Have a listen.

912
00:54:17,260 --> 00:54:19,180
 42 seconds into it.

913
00:54:19,180 --> 00:54:22,260
 There's a little riff and no question, it is Cory.

914
00:54:22,260 --> 00:54:24,180
 It is Coronation Street.

915
00:54:24,180 --> 00:54:25,660
 That's amazing.

916
00:54:25,660 --> 00:54:26,660
 Yeah.

917
00:54:26,660 --> 00:54:27,660
 Fantastic.

918
00:54:27,660 --> 00:54:30,820
 All of these amazing artists, like they do have the reputation for the drink.

919
00:54:30,820 --> 00:54:33,140
 There was lots of sex and drugs and rock and roll in Hendrix's life.

920
00:54:33,140 --> 00:54:36,080
 But also, they just have to work incredibly hard for years.

921
00:54:36,080 --> 00:54:40,040
 Like Hendrix just did hundreds of hours of recordings, all of this.

922
00:54:40,040 --> 00:54:42,760
 You know, like he worked so hard all the way through.

923
00:54:42,760 --> 00:54:48,960
 And also, he was living in England in the kind of era of what was it, been two television

924
00:54:48,960 --> 00:54:53,400
 channels or three television channels, like he was not spoiled for choice.

925
00:54:53,400 --> 00:54:55,160
 So he's like, well, I guess Cory's on.

926
00:54:55,160 --> 00:54:58,600
 I've got another Cory link, I think, because I read that he didn't like anyone seeing him

927
00:54:58,600 --> 00:55:01,680
 with his hair curlers in when his hair was being got ready.

928
00:55:01,680 --> 00:55:03,660
 And that's a Cory thing, isn't it?

929
00:55:03,660 --> 00:55:06,100
 They've always got their curlers in.

930
00:55:06,100 --> 00:55:09,140
 It's a tenuous link, but we'll accept it.

931
00:55:09,140 --> 00:55:14,660
 I think he was a bit paranoid about his coolness status, because I read, and I think I verified

932
00:55:14,660 --> 00:55:18,620
 this, maybe you'll know Nish, but in the song "If Six Was Nine", there's a bit where

933
00:55:18,620 --> 00:55:23,540
 he plays the recorder, and he bought it apparently off a street vendor as kind of a joke.

934
00:55:23,540 --> 00:55:25,020
 He plays the recorder at the end.

935
00:55:25,020 --> 00:55:26,020
 It's a weird sound.

936
00:55:26,020 --> 00:55:29,140
 There's often chat online saying, "What's that weird instrument at the end?"

937
00:55:29,140 --> 00:55:32,760
 But it's listed on the original album as a flute.

938
00:55:32,760 --> 00:55:33,760
 It's a flute.

939
00:55:33,760 --> 00:55:34,760
 Yeah, it is.

940
00:55:34,760 --> 00:55:35,760
 Apparently, he was embarrassed.

941
00:55:35,760 --> 00:55:38,260
 He didn't want to go down as a flute.

942
00:55:38,260 --> 00:55:39,260
 He's embarrassed about playing it.

943
00:55:39,260 --> 00:55:42,360
 The problem with it is that as soon as you hear it, you go, "That's a fucking recorder."

944
00:55:42,360 --> 00:55:43,360
 Like that.

945
00:55:43,360 --> 00:55:46,600
 Like, it doesn't even vaguely sound like a flute.

946
00:55:46,600 --> 00:55:47,600
 Oh, Jimmy.

947
00:55:47,600 --> 00:55:48,600
 What's he playing?

948
00:55:48,600 --> 00:55:51,440
 Is it "London's Burning" that comes in just over the top?

949
00:55:51,440 --> 00:55:55,400
 OK, Nish, have you heard the Morgan Freeman thing?

950
00:55:55,400 --> 00:55:56,400
 What?

951
00:55:56,400 --> 00:55:57,400
 No.

952
00:55:57,400 --> 00:56:00,180
 Well, Hendricks didn't die in 1970.

953
00:56:00,180 --> 00:56:03,980
 He faked his own death, and since then, he's been living as Morgan Freeman.

954
00:56:03,980 --> 00:56:04,980
 What?

955
00:56:04,980 --> 00:56:06,900
 It's a big theory online, yeah.

956
00:56:06,900 --> 00:56:07,900
 OK.

957
00:56:07,900 --> 00:56:09,220
 Freeman owns a blues bar in Mississippi.

958
00:56:09,220 --> 00:56:11,020
 He loves the music of the blues.

959
00:56:11,020 --> 00:56:12,020
 Spooky.

960
00:56:12,020 --> 00:56:14,180
 They don't look completely dissimilar.

961
00:56:14,180 --> 00:56:16,620
 And no one's ever seen Morgan Freeman young.

962
00:56:16,620 --> 00:56:20,740
 Well, Morgan Freeman's first film credit was in 1964, which is six years before Hendricks

963
00:56:20,740 --> 00:56:21,740
 died.

964
00:56:21,740 --> 00:56:24,380
 But if Hendricks had been doing the groundwork, he could have created the character and just

965
00:56:24,380 --> 00:56:27,760
 been slowly starring in movies throughout the '60s.

966
00:56:27,760 --> 00:56:29,840
 I mean, it's a pretty--

967
00:56:29,840 --> 00:56:34,960
 Maybe Morgan Freeman is-- you know, when Bowie became Ziggy Stardust, sort of exclusively

968
00:56:34,960 --> 00:56:39,520
 in real life for a period, maybe Morgan Freeman is his Ziggy, but he just hasn't broken out

969
00:56:39,520 --> 00:56:40,520
 of character yet.

970
00:56:40,520 --> 00:56:42,480
 He's just become too immersed.

971
00:56:42,480 --> 00:56:47,560
 Hey, here's a cool thing that connects Jimmy to the world of British comedy.

972
00:56:47,560 --> 00:56:53,240
 The cover of Axis Baldur's Love, you might remember it, it's a very-- it has Hindu gods

973
00:56:53,240 --> 00:56:55,860
 in the background and very colorful.

974
00:56:55,860 --> 00:57:00,580
 That was designed by Roger Law, who created Spitting Image and all the white Spitting

975
00:57:00,580 --> 00:57:01,580
 Image.

976
00:57:01,580 --> 00:57:02,580
 Yeah.

977
00:57:02,580 --> 00:57:03,580
 That's great.

978
00:57:03,580 --> 00:57:04,580
 Oh my God, that's so good.

979
00:57:04,580 --> 00:57:07,100
 Are you guys familiar with Cynthia Plastercaster?

980
00:57:07,100 --> 00:57:08,100
 Oh, yes.

981
00:57:08,100 --> 00:57:09,100
 No.

982
00:57:09,100 --> 00:57:10,100
 How familiar?

983
00:57:10,100 --> 00:57:15,940
 Can you explain what he did?

984
00:57:15,940 --> 00:57:26,080
 Well, I believe Cynthia Plastercaster used to make Plastercasts of the genitals of famous

985
00:57:26,080 --> 00:57:28,520
 people in the '60s.

986
00:57:28,520 --> 00:57:32,280
 That is correct, except the thing is, everyone always says that, when you look up the list

987
00:57:32,280 --> 00:57:36,400
 of people she made them for, I think most famous people said, "I'd rather you didn't

988
00:57:36,400 --> 00:57:38,560
 make a Plastercast of my penis."

989
00:57:38,560 --> 00:57:39,560
 Oh, OK.

990
00:57:39,560 --> 00:57:40,560
 One of the only people who did say--

991
00:57:40,560 --> 00:57:43,480
 There's no easy way of avoiding someone making a Plastercast of your penis.

992
00:57:43,480 --> 00:57:45,360
 Well, yes, but Jimmy didn't.

993
00:57:45,360 --> 00:57:46,360
 He's got the whole Plastercast.

994
00:57:46,360 --> 00:57:47,940
 Isn't that an amazing thing to do?

995
00:57:47,940 --> 00:57:48,940
 Yeah.

996
00:57:48,940 --> 00:57:54,060
 Just say to this random, weird lady kind of groupie, "Yeah, I'll shove my erect penis

997
00:57:54,060 --> 00:57:55,060
 into your plaster."

998
00:57:55,060 --> 00:57:56,060
 That's right.

999
00:57:56,060 --> 00:57:57,300
 No one wants flaccid Plastercast.

1000
00:57:57,300 --> 00:57:58,300
 You're right.

1001
00:57:58,300 --> 00:57:59,300
 You're right.

1002
00:57:59,300 --> 00:58:00,300
 That's so funny.

1003
00:58:00,300 --> 00:58:03,880
 And there's no details on how it was made erect, whether it was a little bit like when

1004
00:58:03,880 --> 00:58:04,880
 you'd give a sperm donation.

1005
00:58:04,880 --> 00:58:07,540
 I don't know if they send you and took room with a bunch of magazines.

1006
00:58:07,540 --> 00:58:12,740
 There was a heavy inference that she was part of the-- there was no magazine in the waiting

1007
00:58:12,740 --> 00:58:13,740
 room.

1008
00:58:13,740 --> 00:58:14,740
 She was the magazine.

1009
00:58:14,740 --> 00:58:15,740
 She was the magazine.

1010
00:58:15,740 --> 00:58:16,740
 Exactly.

1011
00:58:16,740 --> 00:58:17,740
 She was the-- yes.

1012
00:58:17,740 --> 00:58:19,240
 Where is this Plastercast now?

1013
00:58:19,240 --> 00:58:21,680
 It's in the Iceland phallological museum, actually.

1014
00:58:21,680 --> 00:58:22,680
 Get out.

1015
00:58:22,680 --> 00:58:23,680
 Is it really?

1016
00:58:23,680 --> 00:58:24,680
 Yeah.

1017
00:58:24,680 --> 00:58:25,680
 Yeah, I think so.

1018
00:58:25,680 --> 00:58:26,680
 Wow.

1019
00:58:26,680 --> 00:58:27,680
 Have you seen a niche?

1020
00:58:27,680 --> 00:58:28,680
 I have not.

1021
00:58:28,680 --> 00:58:29,680
 Have you been over?

1022
00:58:29,680 --> 00:58:30,680
 Not other than a fan, then.

1023
00:58:30,680 --> 00:58:38,680
 My Hendricks fandom has not extended to going to visit the Plastercast of his penis.

1024
00:58:38,680 --> 00:58:42,760
 Listen, if I'm in the area, of course I'm taking a look at it.

1025
00:58:42,760 --> 00:58:50,540
 Have I seen it on Google Images yet, but that's not-- let's move on.

1026
00:58:50,540 --> 00:58:52,740
 Move on.

1027
00:58:52,740 --> 00:58:54,220
 Is it my phone wallpaper?

1028
00:58:54,220 --> 00:58:55,220
 Yes.

1029
00:58:55,220 --> 00:58:56,220
 Move on.

1030
00:58:56,220 --> 00:58:59,780
 All right, look, we need to wrap up.

1031
00:58:59,780 --> 00:59:01,820
 Nish, you're going to be in Edinburgh, right?

1032
00:59:01,820 --> 00:59:02,820
 Yes.

1033
00:59:02,820 --> 00:59:06,860
 I'm going to be at the Edinburgh Fringe Festival, and I am very excited about it, and this is

1034
00:59:06,860 --> 00:59:12,100
 not me stalling for time whilst I Google what time my show is.

1035
00:59:12,100 --> 00:59:19,320
 My show, which I know the time and location of, is at 10 past 5 in the afternoon at the

1036
00:59:19,320 --> 00:59:22,080
 Assembly Theatre in George Square.

1037
00:59:22,080 --> 00:59:23,080
 Do come along.

1038
00:59:23,080 --> 00:59:24,080
 I will be there.

1039
00:59:24,080 --> 00:59:28,520
 I cannot deliver performance dynamics on a level of Jimi Hendricks, but what I can promise

1040
00:59:28,520 --> 00:59:30,960
 is I will be there on time.

1041
00:59:30,960 --> 00:59:34,840
 What a sound.

1042
00:59:34,840 --> 00:59:38,640
 Okay, that's it.

1043
00:59:38,640 --> 00:59:40,360
 That is all of our guest facts.

1044
00:59:40,360 --> 00:59:43,820
 Come back again next week, because we've got another show with four more comedians who

1045
00:59:43,820 --> 00:59:46,700
 are all going to be going up to the Edinburgh Fringe this year.

1046
00:59:46,700 --> 00:59:47,700
 So we'll see you then.

1047
00:59:47,700 --> 00:59:48,700
 Goodbye.
