00:00:00,00:00:07,"Hi everyone, welcome to this, the first of two very special episodes of No Such Thing"
00:00:07,00:00:12,"as a Fish. Now, anyone who's into comedy will know that the Edinburgh Fringe Festival"
00:00:12,00:00:18,has just begun up in Scotland and we are not going there this year but what we thought
00:00:18,00:00:23,we would do is highlight some of our very favourite comedians who will be up there.
00:00:23,00:00:27,"So if you're travelling up to Edinburgh, you can listen to this and decide who you"
00:00:27,00:00:32,"like and who you want to get tickets for. These are some of our very, very favourite"
00:00:32,00:00:38,comedians out on the circuit right now. We handpicked ones who we think you will especially
00:00:38,00:00:39,like.
00:00:39,00:00:45,Fact number one will be Ian Smith. He was nominated in 2023 for Best Show at Edinburgh
00:00:45,00:00:51,for his show Crushing and he is the co-host of the Northern News Podcast with Amy Gladhill.
00:00:51,00:00:55,It's an absolutely brilliant podcast. If you're not going up to Edinburgh then definitely
00:00:55,00:01:01,"check that out and find out more about him. After Ian, you will hear from Abby Howells."
00:01:01,00:01:06,Now Abby is a New Zealand comic. You will know her from New Zealand Taskmaster and from
00:01:06,00:01:11,Guy Montgomery's Guy Monspelling Bee. I know a lot of people in the UK dig around the internet
00:01:11,00:01:16,to find episodes of those and Abby is a particular favourite of anyone who likes New Zealand
00:01:16,00:01:21,comedy. She will be up in Edinburgh this year so definitely check out her show.
00:01:21,00:01:27,"The third person, fact number three will come from Aruj Ashfak. Now Aruj, she won the Best"
00:01:27,00:01:33,Newcomer at Edinburgh for her show Oh No in 2023. She is based in Mumbai and in fact
00:01:33,00:01:38,"she was the first India based comedian to ever win the award. She's absolutely brilliant,"
00:01:38,00:01:40,absolutely lovely. I know you'll love her.
00:01:40,00:01:46,And then finally fact number four will come from Nish Kumar who needs no introduction
00:01:46,00:01:51,I'm sure to anyone listening to this podcast but you'll know him from all British panel
00:01:51,00:01:57,shows especially of course QI. Now a fifth person from this podcast who will be at the
00:01:57,00:02:03,Edinburgh Fringe is a young up and coming start up called Dan Schreiber. He will be
00:02:03,00:02:08,here with his other podcast The Cryptid Factor which I know a lot of you are fans of. He'll
00:02:08,00:02:13,be here with Buttons and with Rhys Darby and they will be doing their crazy thing at the
00:02:13,00:02:19,Gilded Balloon in the first week of the festival. So if you want to see Dan up there you're
00:02:19,00:02:23,going to have to get in there quick. Anyway I really really hope you enjoy this podcast.
00:02:23,00:02:28,It's something a bit new for us having four different guests on but we really enjoy doing
00:02:28,00:02:32,"it and I really hope you guys will enjoy it too. If you like what you hear from Nish,"
00:02:32,00:02:37,"Aruj, Abby or Ian then definitely check those out. If you're not going to Edinburgh then"
00:02:37,00:02:41,"get on the internet, follow them all on social media, find out everything they've done on"
00:02:41,00:02:45,YouTube etc. And if you are going to Edinburgh and you see any of them then make sure you
00:02:45,00:02:50,tell them that NoSix Thinkers and Fish sent you. Anyway that's enough from me. There's
00:02:50,00:02:53,not much more to say apart from on with the podcast.
00:02:53,00:03:21,"Hello and welcome to another episode of NoSix Thinkers of Fish, a weekly podcast coming"
00:03:21,00:03:27,"to you from eight undisclosed locations around the world. My name is Dan Schreiber, I am"
00:03:27,00:03:32,"sitting here with Anna Tyshinski, Andrew Hunter Murray, James Harkin and four very"
00:03:32,00:03:37,special guests and once again we have gathered around the microphones with our four favourite
00:03:37,00:03:44,facts from the last seven days and in no particular order here we go. Starting with fact number
00:03:44,00:03:51,"one and that is Ian Smith. At the 2020 British Puzzle Championship, Sarah Mills solved a"
00:03:51,00:03:57,1000 piece jigsaw puzzle in one hour and 40 minutes. That's an average of one piece every
00:03:57,00:04:03,"six seconds. That's not possible right? Like surely. No, I think it's easy, isn't it? Oh"
00:04:03,00:04:08,"come on. Really? Six seconds. Sarah Mills listening to the podcast Furious. I don't know,"
00:04:08,00:04:16,"that was a long time, right? And at the end, like the last one, you don't have to think"
00:04:16,00:04:21,"about that. Okay, so we can minus the last one in the first one, right? The time is"
00:04:21,00:04:28,sort of really extended out by that first bit where you're just turning them all around.
00:04:28,00:04:36,"Ian, why are you into jigsaws? Is that why you picked this? Well, not really, no. I think"
00:04:36,00:04:42,"it started because I was in the Highlands. Me and my girlfriend, we walked past a charity"
00:04:42,00:04:52,"shop and we saw like a mad Ravensburger jigsaw, like a really surreal underwater scene that"
00:04:52,00:04:58,looked like it had been compiled by a kind of like Salvador Dali-esque artist. And she
00:04:58,00:05:03,was laughing at it and she said she'd really loved the jigsaw. But the shop was closed.
00:05:03,00:05:09,"So just by googling descriptions of what I saw in the jigsaw, I tried to track it down."
00:05:09,00:05:15,"And we did that, but then I became very paranoid. I think I have this pessimism that as the"
00:05:15,00:05:20,"jigsaw was getting closer to completion, I was convinced that a piece wasn't there."
00:05:20,00:05:23,"Right. Oh, Ian, I thought what you were going to"
00:05:23,00:05:27,"say is that when you finished it, she was going to split up with you and the jigsaw was"
00:05:27,00:05:33,"the only thing keeping you together. So I'm hiding pieces around the house. No, I sort"
00:05:33,00:05:40,"of, I lost my head a little bit. And at one point, I'm not proud of this. I emptied the"
00:05:40,00:05:46,Hoover and I looked through all the dust because I thought I'd hoovered up a jigsaw piece.
00:05:46,00:05:50,I think at one point it was pointing out to me that I'm getting the floor very dirty.
00:05:50,00:05:54,But I was very happy with that because I was holding a Hoover. I had all the tools to sort
00:05:54,00:06:02,"of clean this up again. But yeah, the piece wasn't missing. The piece was resting on top"
00:06:02,00:06:07,of the jigsaw on a color that it looked similar to. No.
00:06:07,00:06:11,"But yeah, then I sort of entered a jigsaw speed tournament because I thought that'd"
00:06:11,00:06:17,"be a fun thing to do with my girlfriend. But yeah, we accidentally entered, I think like"
00:06:17,00:06:23,a championship event. The barriers to entry in the jigsaw world
00:06:23,00:06:28,seems lower as in normally you can't accidentally enter like the 100 meters at the Olympics.
00:06:28,00:06:31,And like they really are strict about that. So were you a pair entry? Because this is
00:06:31,00:06:36,"the thing, isn't it? Like, individuals do 500 pieces and then pairs normally do 1000"
00:06:36,00:06:39,"pieces. Yeah, yeah. We were a couple, I'm not trying"
00:06:39,00:06:44,"to frustrate on the jigsaw community, but we felt like we were the most attractive couple"
00:06:44,00:06:51,"at the jigsaw event. I'm sorry, but it was an older group. And we felt like we were really"
00:06:51,00:06:59,young and dynamic. Like I was wearing a leather jacket and sunglasses. I was really playing
00:06:59,00:07:03,up to the sort of bad boy of jigsaw. The James Dean of jigsaws.
00:07:03,00:07:05,"What everyone wants to know, Ian, is how you did?"
00:07:05,00:07:10,"Well, I think that's why I've tried to overcompensate at the beginning by saying we were the coolest"
00:07:10,00:07:21,couple. We did not finish. We didn't finish. And we sort of snuck out because we were there
00:07:21,00:07:26,"for three hours, and we had not done a lot of the jigsaw. And multiple people were already"
00:07:26,00:07:32,standing up and sort of fist pumping. So we just sort of slowly slid it back into the
00:07:32,00:07:37,"box and yeah, I went home. It was quite sad."
00:07:37,00:07:42,"What's the vibe like, Ian? Is it like, if you make any noise, do you get tutted at and"
00:07:42,00:07:46,stuff? It's very serious. Like everyone has a kitchen
00:07:46,00:07:52,spatula. Everyone except us. Is that for spanking their colleagues if they make a mistake or
00:07:52,00:07:54,they try and jam a piece in where it doesn't go?
00:07:54,00:08:02,"It's a very racy event, actually. It's apparently to scoop the jigsaw pieces with more ease."
00:08:02,00:08:08,Because it's quite hard to pick them up. So they scoop in them. The table that won had
00:08:08,00:08:14,"two electrolyte pouches on their table, like if you were running American. And we're like"
00:08:14,00:08:15,doing them for energy.
00:08:15,00:08:20,"If you didn't have a spatula, no wonder you took three hours and hadn't done any of it."
00:08:20,00:08:21,We didn't have the tools.
00:08:21,00:08:26,I can't see how a spatula would help though. I struggle getting an egg out of the frying
00:08:26,00:08:31,"pan and not having the yolk break, let alone trying to get a single piece of jigsaw with"
00:08:31,00:08:33,a spatula. That's a wild skill.
00:08:33,00:08:37,"I think the thing is that if you've done like a cat and you've done the cat, okay, you need"
00:08:37,00:08:41,"to move the cat to another part of the table, then you don't want to pick it all up and"
00:08:41,00:08:42,move it.
00:08:42,00:08:47,"Beautiful. Okay, I get it now. Ian, you need to describe this better, mate."
00:08:47,00:08:48,I'm sorry.
00:08:48,00:08:49,That was kidding me.
00:08:49,00:08:56,I think I've only truly learned what the spatula is for right now. I thought it was just for
00:08:56,00:09:01,"scooping, like clearing the table up. But as soon as you said that, I was like, ""Yeah,"
00:09:01,00:09:03,"that is so clearly what that spatula is for."""
00:09:03,00:09:09,"It's such a shame that you didn't, because you know every year there's like, ""Oh, this"
00:09:09,00:09:13,"guy, he tried to do the marathon and okay, he broke his leg halfway through or he didn't"
00:09:13,00:09:18,"do it, but he kept going and three days later, everyone's cheering him over the line and"
00:09:18,00:09:20,"that could have been you guys."""
00:09:20,00:09:24,"Yeah, still in the venue. Everyone's left. It's like a function room. There's probably"
00:09:24,00:09:29,"like another function on there now. It's just like a wedding going on. I'm like, ""I'm so"
00:09:29,00:09:30,"close now."""
00:09:30,00:09:33,"Where did you do it, Ian?"
00:09:33,00:09:35,This was in Newmarket.
00:09:35,00:09:36,"Newmarket, right."
00:09:36,00:09:42,There was also a car and motorbike event in the same building and it was so easily definable
00:09:42,00:09:44,of like who was at which event.
00:09:44,00:09:48,"Well, no, they'll have seen you Ian in your leather jacket and thought, ""Oh, he's probably"
00:09:48,00:09:51,"here for the Harley-Davidson's."""
00:09:51,00:09:55,Did you find that was the end of your career and you've not been able to look at a jigsaw
00:09:55,00:09:59,since or have you kept your hand in a little bit?
00:09:59,00:10:04,I haven't done a jigsaw since. Me and my girlfriend were between flats at the minute. We thought
00:10:04,00:10:08,we were going to be moving in a flat. It got delayed by a lot of times. So we're in like
00:10:08,00:10:13,"Airbnbs for like a week at a time. And with the speed we do a jigsaw, that's not enough"
00:10:13,00:10:18,time to set it up on a table and finish it.
00:10:18,00:10:19,Do you have a jig roll?
00:10:19,00:10:27,A jig roll? Is that like a Swiss roll jigsaw combination?
00:10:27,00:10:33,I was just trying to gauge how professional you are because it's like a bolt of cloth
00:10:33,00:10:38,that you do the jigsaw on. So you can keep a half-done puzzle on that and the pieces
00:10:38,00:10:39,stick to it.
00:10:39,00:10:40,I have one.
00:10:40,00:10:41,Do you?
00:10:41,00:10:43,"Yeah, yeah. I've never done a jigsaw in my life, but I still have one."
00:10:43,00:10:44,You've got to be prepared.
00:10:44,00:10:45,Really?
00:10:45,00:10:46,You never know.
00:10:46,00:10:51,"You've presumably got a spatula. James, you're halfway there to being the other one."
00:10:51,00:10:56,"What's the difference between a jig roll and, say, your average bit of cloth?"
00:10:56,00:10:59,I'll hand over to my colleague James here who's the other person.
00:10:59,00:11:04,"I've never opened it, so I'm not really sure. But I think it's like slightly more stiff"
00:11:04,00:11:09,than a piece of cloth. So you kind of roll it and it kind of keeps its form a bit more.
00:11:09,00:11:10,"Oh, nice."
00:11:10,00:11:15,"So it kind of holds the integrity of the jigsaw. But I think, like, I bought it for my wife"
00:11:15,00:11:18,because one time she told me she liked jigsaws and I bought her a jigsaw and a jig roll
00:11:18,00:11:22,and it turned out she didn't like jigsaws after all.
00:11:22,00:11:25,I think that happens a lot.
00:11:25,00:11:30,I love the idea that James has a kind of potential hobby's chamber. It's this massive hangar
00:11:30,00:11:33,"and it's full of everything he might possibly want to take up. Like, there's a paragliding"
00:11:33,00:11:37,thing in there and there's like a golden backgammon set and all this.
00:11:37,00:11:39,Just in case at 2am someone mentions it.
00:11:39,00:11:40,Yeah.
00:11:40,00:11:45,"They're really secretive at these competitions. So Ravensburger, who are, I think, the big"
00:11:45,00:11:47,"cheese of the jigsaw world, aren't they?"
00:11:47,00:11:54,"Gibson will try and say they're a big cheese as well, but Ravensburger, they've put them"
00:11:54,00:11:55,in the ground.
00:11:55,00:11:58,They've cornered the market and edged the market.
00:11:58,00:12:03,"Very strong, very strong. They will generate a new puzzle for every one of these competitions"
00:12:03,00:12:09,and they're kept in top secret conditions in their laboratory in Bister.
00:12:09,00:12:13,"People are so proud of their jigsaws. For example, there's a few charity shops down"
00:12:13,00:12:18,"in the area that I live in Margate. In every single one, I saw a giant framed finished"
00:12:18,00:12:22,jigsaw that is just now a piece of art.
00:12:22,00:12:23,Yeah.
00:12:23,00:12:29,"Dan, that has happened too. I think this is the largest puzzle ever made just two years"
00:12:29,00:12:36,"ago in Derbyshire. It's 120,000 pieces. It's 30 centimetres tall, but it's a third of a"
00:12:36,00:12:37,mile long.
00:12:37,00:12:43,What is the image of? Because it's quite hard to think like a snake would fit in that kind
00:12:43,00:12:45,of aspect ratio or a worm.
00:12:45,00:12:49,"It's a sausage. It's just a very, very long, very long sausage. Hard to do."
00:12:49,00:12:50,Wow.
00:12:50,00:12:51,And that's framed.
00:12:51,00:12:56,"Oh, no, I'm thinking of a different one that was framed, which was 33,000 pieces, give"
00:12:56,00:13:00,or take. And a man called Graham Andrew in Norfolk was trying to do it with a load of
00:13:00,00:13:04,volunteers like it was a real community effort. People would drop in and help. And as they
00:13:04,00:13:10,"got to the end, they had the nightmare situation that Ian had that four pieces were missing."
00:13:10,00:13:15,And he had already thought of this. He had bought a second version of the puzzle just
00:13:15,00:13:22,"in case. So they sifted through 33,000 pieces to find the missing four. Unfortunately, they"
00:13:22,00:13:26,didn't quite fit because it wasn't exactly the same cut.
00:13:26,00:13:27,"Oh, God."
00:13:27,00:13:30,"And he said, Mr. Andrew said, I considered squishing them in, but decided it had to be"
00:13:30,00:13:35,done properly. So I asked the company to re-cut them. So the Jigsaw company had to send out
00:13:35,00:13:38,like a specially print four pieces and send them out.
00:13:38,00:13:40,And it's done. It's all done.
00:13:40,00:13:42,It's done now. And that one has been framed and put up.
00:13:42,00:13:51,Do you think the volunteers he got in one of them thought it is funny to take a piece?
00:13:51,00:13:57,"It's very cruel, but it would be really tempting to go, I'm going to help out for two hours."
00:13:57,00:14:02,"I'm going to really do a decoy, but I'm pocketing two of these pieces."
00:14:02,00:14:06,It actually sounds like four people had that idea. And I can imagine them all going in
00:14:06,00:14:10,"the pub afterwards, going, you did it as well, you did it as well."
00:14:10,00:14:14,"There's one other cool Jigsaw that you can get your hands on, which I quite like. So"
00:14:14,00:14:22,"Jigsaw puzzler people, people who do it, there's a word that describes them, which is dissectologists."
00:14:22,00:14:26,"So this was in the 18th century, when they were first made Jigsaws, they weren't called"
00:14:26,00:14:30,Jigsaws. They were called dissected puzzles or dissected maps. So I guess you were putting
00:14:30,00:14:35,"a dissected map back together. So you became a dissectologist. And in 1985, a guy called"
00:14:35,00:14:41,Tom Tyler founded a club for Jigsaw puzzle lovers. And it's called the benevolent confraternity
00:14:41,00:14:46,of dissectologists. And this is a club that's still going to this day for Jigsaw.
00:14:46,00:14:50,"I've, I've, I've, I've been, I've, I bought my wife membership."
00:14:50,00:14:54,"No, oh my God. So you've got the exciting, did you get the exciting membership card?"
00:14:54,00:14:55,Yeah.
00:14:55,00:14:56,Which is a Jigsaw.
00:14:56,00:14:57,"Oh, yeah."
00:14:57,00:15:01,"You know what? I thought buying my wife a Jigsaw and a Jigsaw, Matt was a really bad gift,"
00:15:01,00:15:05,"but this is awful, Andy."
00:15:05,00:15:09,We remain married.
00:15:09,00:15:12,"You can't even, you can't even rip up your membership card in protest because you're"
00:15:12,00:15:15,then just creating a fun puzzle.
00:15:15,00:15:17,Do you know why Jigsaws are called Jigsaws?
00:15:17,00:15:21,"I could say you use a Jigsaw to cut them, presumably."
00:15:21,00:15:26,"Well, that is it. Apart from when they were invented, the Jigsaw hadn't been invented"
00:15:26,00:15:27,yet.
00:15:27,00:15:28,Right.
00:15:28,00:15:33,"Now, they don't use Jigsaws anymore. Like they use lasers and stuff. So for a very short"
00:15:33,00:15:38,"amount of time, they did use Jigsaws and that was when they named it. But for most of the"
00:15:38,00:15:40,"start of their life and most of the end of life, you never use Jigsaws."
00:15:40,00:15:44,"That's so funny. The Jigsaw is the one that goes up and down and up and down, isn't it?"
00:15:44,00:15:47,And you push a bit of wood around in a shape and that.
00:15:47,00:15:51,And it's named after the fact that it looks like the saw is doing a little jig.
00:15:51,00:15:52,Right.
00:15:52,00:15:53,Right.
00:15:53,00:15:54,This is good. I didn't know that.
00:15:54,00:15:55,Do you propose?
00:15:55,00:15:56,That's very weird.
00:15:56,00:15:58,I would change their name now to Lasers.
00:15:58,00:15:59,Oh yeah.
00:15:59,00:16:01,I think more people would buy them.
00:16:01,00:16:04,In your sunglasses with your leather jacket in the front of the queue.
00:16:04,00:16:06,With my laser club membership.
00:16:06,00:16:10,"Go down to laser quest, then go down to the laser club."
00:16:10,00:16:14,"All right. Well, we need to wrap up. Ian, you're going to be up in Edinburgh, right?"
00:16:14,00:16:15,With a new show.
00:16:15,00:16:22,"Yeah. I'm doing a show. It's called Foot Spa Half Empty, which is partly because you've"
00:16:22,00:16:26,got to name the show in January before you've written any of it.
00:16:26,00:16:30,"But yeah, it's on at 12.30 in the afternoon at Monkey Barrel."
00:16:30,00:16:35,"Yeah, I feel very excited about it. It's 20 minutes too long at the minute."
00:16:35,00:16:38,But I've got a bit of time to get rid of that.
00:16:38,00:16:43,"But yeah, I'd love it if people could come along. Otherwise it would be sad if no one"
00:16:43,00:16:44,else comes.
00:16:44,00:16:55,"OK, it's time for fact number two, and that is Abby Howells."
00:16:55,00:17:03,"My fact is in 1386, a pig was put on trial for murder."
00:17:03,00:17:04,OK.
00:17:04,00:17:05,What?
00:17:05,00:17:06,OK.
00:17:06,00:17:13,"Yes, the pig was a bit naughty. It did more the child to dead."
00:17:13,00:17:16,"Oh, wow. This got that quite quickly."
00:17:16,00:17:22,"Yes, but I have one fun fact that will hopefully wind it up."
00:17:22,00:17:29,"It was executed by a hanging, but they dressed the pig in human clothes to kill it."
00:17:29,00:17:30,Good stuff.
00:17:30,00:17:33,"You're right. There's not there's not enough fun in execution, is there?"
00:17:33,00:17:39,"That sends a message that it can be done. Yeah, I mean, it's pretty grim, eh? Dressing"
00:17:39,00:17:41,a pig up in a waistcoat and then hanging it.
00:17:41,00:17:45,"Oh, come on, it's a funny image. Until the hanging, it's a funny image."
00:17:45,00:17:50,Can I make it even more grim? So she had six piglets and they were all put on trial as
00:17:50,00:17:52,accessories to murder.
00:17:52,00:17:53,What?
00:17:53,00:17:54,What?
00:17:54,00:17:55,That's really unfair.
00:17:55,00:17:56,And they were found guilty.
00:17:56,00:18:01,"They were found guilty, but they were acquitted on grounds of youth and that the mother had"
00:18:01,00:18:03,been a bad example to them.
00:18:03,00:18:06,"OK, did they get a better lawyer for that bit of the trial?"
00:18:06,00:18:07,Yeah.
00:18:07,00:18:09,Because clearly the first one didn't do a great job.
00:18:09,00:18:13,"Yeah, the pig represented themselves and it was a mess."
00:18:13,00:18:16,"Crazy, get a lawyer. No, it's fine."
00:18:16,00:18:19,This is my moment. I can't do this.
00:18:19,00:18:24,And then all else I found about it is the actual hanging as well. They had to give the hangman
00:18:24,00:18:29,a new pair of gloves. After it was part of his pay was that he would get a new pair of
00:18:29,00:18:31,gloves for doing the hanging.
00:18:31,00:18:32,This is crazy.
00:18:32,00:18:37,"Yeah, although there was an article on JSTOR that said, and as they put it, the hangman"
00:18:37,00:18:42,"in this case, it was in a place called Filets, I think in France, the hangman is still owed"
00:18:42,00:18:45,both for the execution and the new gloves.
00:18:45,00:18:46,Still?
00:18:46,00:18:47,"Oh, what?"
00:18:47,00:18:48,My gosh.
00:18:48,00:18:51,"Yeah, he's turning in his grave waiting to be paid for this gruesome task because it's"
00:18:51,00:18:53,not easy to dress a pig up.
00:18:53,00:18:58,"It wasn't easy to be a hangman, to be honest, in those days. Like you would get your own"
00:18:58,00:19:02,"house and you'd get fed and you'd get loads of stuff, but no one was allowed to come near"
00:19:02,00:19:06,you. No one was allowed to touch you. No one was allowed to talk to you. You'd be like
00:19:06,00:19:09,"a special person in their town, but you'd be completely away."
00:19:09,00:19:18,Do you think that they are dressing the pig up? Who was ordering there? Was that the
00:19:18,00:19:23,"hangman who was like, listen, I've got an idea. It sounds a little bit crazy."
00:19:23,00:19:26,I think maybe the local tailor.
00:19:26,00:19:29,"Oh, a bit of advertising."
00:19:29,00:19:32,"Yeah, then the local bluffmakers were like, I'm getting in on this as well."
00:19:32,00:19:37,"Yeah, because a lot of people went to watch, so you've got a big audience there. I read"
00:19:37,00:19:43,"one account that they put a human face mask on the pig as well, but there's many accounts,"
00:19:43,00:19:48,so it's hard to know which one necessarily to trust. But I was reading a long article
00:19:48,00:19:52,"in the Medievalist, which is a site that talks about all the stuff that was happening"
00:19:52,00:19:58,"back then. They said that in the 12th and 13th century, that the reason a lot of animals"
00:19:58,00:20:03,went on trial in this period. So something like 85 examples that we know of. The reason
00:20:03,00:20:07,"they were happening was law suddenly became a bigger thing in more places around Europe,"
00:20:07,00:20:13,and so there were way more lawyers than they had cases to deal with. And so they needed
00:20:13,00:20:18,to get practice. And so quite often a lot of lawyers would defend a pig and try and
00:20:18,00:20:23,"get it off using new methods and like, oh, I tried this new thing out. The judge didn't"
00:20:23,00:20:27,"like it though. Damn it. Okay, I won't do that with humans. So it's just like a testing"
00:20:27,00:20:33,"ground. Because they did. They found cool ways of exonerating their clients, I guess."
00:20:33,00:20:40,"There was a 1500s French lawyer called Chathane, who built his whole legal reputation on being"
00:20:40,00:20:45,the counsel for rats that were on trial for destroying a field of barley. And first of
00:20:45,00:20:50,"all, so they didn't turn up to court when they were summoned. And he found this thing"
00:20:50,00:20:55,"in the law that said that if you could plausibly have not seen the notice, then you don't need"
00:20:55,00:20:59,"to turn up. And he was like, these rats live in loads of different places. So then every"
00:20:59,00:21:04,single parish council like within a 50 mile radius had to put like a big announcement
00:21:04,00:21:08,"out saying, okay, all rats need to come to court on this date. And then when they still"
00:21:08,00:21:13,"didn't appear, the lawyer said, actually, there's a thing in the law that says if a"
00:21:13,00:21:19,"person sighted to appear at a court, but they can't come safely, they are allowed to refuse"
00:21:19,00:21:24,"to obey. And of course, these rats can't come safely because of the unwearyed vigilance"
00:21:24,00:21:29,"of their mortal enemies, the cats who are always waiting."
00:21:29,00:21:34,"I was just wondering, like, you know, in terms of practicing law techniques and stuff, was"
00:21:34,00:21:39,"it all that showmanship, you know, the wrestle dazzle that we see, like, I've got a surprise"
00:21:39,00:21:48,"witness. He's like, a dog. And the dogs up there with like a cigarette, like, you'll"
00:21:48,00:21:50,never crack me.
00:21:50,00:21:55,"I was going, where did he get his suit? It's stunning. That tailor is good in this town."
00:21:55,00:22:01,"I think one of the theory is that if you were a landowner, and let's say someone at all"
00:22:01,00:22:06,"your barley, some rats did, then you would want some money back for it. But you couldn't"
00:22:06,00:22:10,do that unless there'd been some legal process and someone had been found guilty. And so
00:22:10,00:22:14,that's why these rats were put on trial so that the owners would get something.
00:22:14,00:22:21,"Right. Abby, is this a personal interest of yours? Did you study animal law at uni?"
00:22:21,00:22:29,"Well, kind of. No. Well, I do. Okay. Here's, you know, here we go. I have a PhD. And my"
00:22:29,00:22:35,"PhD is on women in prison and the way they've portrayed in television, film and theatre."
00:22:35,00:22:36,Wow.
00:22:36,00:22:42,It's not a good PhD. I don't treat anyone to find it. It's ideally scraped in. Like when
00:22:42,00:22:50,"I handed it in, they were like, you serious? And I was like, please. It's embarrassing"
00:22:50,00:22:58,for us if you don't pass. But basically a big chunk of my thesis was on public executions
00:22:58,00:23:03,"and like the spectacle of them because they were like, you know, that was the entertainment."
00:23:03,00:23:08,"Like you'd be like, oh, Friday night. What are we going to do? Should we pop down? See"
00:23:08,00:23:13,"a lovely execution? Someone's been treasonous. Well, and if it's an animal being executed,"
00:23:13,00:23:16,"like that's even better. That's more Rapool, isn't it? Because it's still a bit more rare."
00:23:16,00:23:22,"And you can have a barbecue afterwards. Yeah, I did wonder about that. Did they eat it?"
00:23:22,00:23:27,"It feels like in those days, you wouldn't want to waste a pig, even a naughty one."
00:23:27,00:23:30,Yeah. And one dressed so deshingly. Yeah.
00:23:30,00:23:34,And one of the theories as to why they did all this stuff is because it just showed that
00:23:34,00:23:39,"the authorities were doing something, right? So all bad stuff's happening. People have"
00:23:39,00:23:44,"been, you know, lost the barley or their animals have killed people and they're like, okay,"
00:23:44,00:23:47,"well, we have to show that we're not just sitting back and letting this happen. So we're"
00:23:47,00:23:52,"going to put something on trial. And quite often, like if your barley got eaten or whatever,"
00:23:52,00:23:57,"it would be like all the mice are in trouble, but they would just pick one mouse and then"
00:23:57,00:24:02,"put like a show trial on for that one mouse. That's a fiddly job for the tailor, isn't"
00:24:02,00:24:07,"it? That's a challenging one. And probably a carpenter, presumably has to build a tiny"
00:24:07,00:24:12,dock for it to go into. What a gig.
00:24:12,00:24:16,And I think people think maybe it didn't happen in England and Scotland and Wales. It was
00:24:16,00:24:21,"just Western Europe, like Switzerland, France, Italy, because we had jury trials. This is"
00:24:21,00:24:27,"what a BBC documentary said. We had jury trials and it would be harder to, with a straight"
00:24:27,00:24:30,"face, present a full jury. Well, these cases,"
00:24:30,00:24:36,"your jury is supposed to be 12 equals, right? So you have to get, yeah, 12 pigs."
00:24:36,00:24:40,"That's a chaotic courtroom, isn't it?"
00:24:40,00:24:45,"I'd love to know more about the hangman who, as was being mentioned before, is so isolated"
00:24:45,00:24:50,"from the rest of the community that they presumably are just told, you've got a job today, you've"
00:24:50,00:24:54,"got to kill someone. And they just keep rocking up. And he's like, what the fuck is this?"
00:24:54,00:25:02,"It's a mouse. Yeah, it's, we've sort of expanded your brief recently. Jesus, how am I gonna"
00:25:02,00:25:04,get the noose around? No one prepared me for this.
00:25:04,00:25:11,"There's actually this hangman in New Zealand. Like, we had a murderer called Minnie Dean."
00:25:11,00:25:17,And she's one of our most famous murderers that we have here in New Zealand. And she murdered
00:25:17,00:25:21,children and put them in head boxes. When was this?
00:25:21,00:25:26,"I think like, maybe I want to say like late 1800s, early 1900s."
00:25:26,00:25:28,"Oh, it was a long time ago."
00:25:28,00:25:34,"Long time ago, yeah, yes. And she was found guilty and sentenced to execution. And they"
00:25:34,00:25:38,could find no one to hang her. No one wanted to do it. But they had this guy that basically
00:25:38,00:25:44,had hung up his noose a long time ago. And then he'd gone to like live in the bush. And
00:25:44,00:25:48,"they were like, we've got to get this guy. He's the only one. And then they found him"
00:25:48,00:25:53,"and he's like, I'll do it. But with one condition, I want to spend 30 minutes with her in the"
00:25:53,00:25:59,"room. And so he went and like spent 30 minutes with her. And then he was like, I'll do it."
00:25:59,00:26:02,So she must have been a punishing hang.
00:26:02,00:26:04,What happened in that 30 minutes?
00:26:04,00:26:07,No one knows what they talked about.
00:26:07,00:26:08,That's a film.
00:26:08,00:26:09,Yeah.
00:26:09,00:26:13,"Yeah. Yeah, I'm sure I've, I'm some very mediocre play scripts have been read about"
00:26:13,00:26:20,them. Pigs are still getting in trouble these days. Are they lots of naughty pigs around?
00:26:20,00:26:25,"Well, I just remember that great story of how Peppa Pig had an episode banned in Australia"
00:26:25,00:26:30,because she makes friends with a spider and they couldn't play that over there because
00:26:30,00:26:35,it taught young kids to go and walk up to because didn't she say like spiders are our
00:26:35,00:26:38,friends and they can't harm us or something like that?
00:26:38,00:26:43,"Yeah. But I don't think Peppa's met a funnel web. So it's sort of a big, big problem over"
00:26:43,00:26:52,"in Oz. And I think in Korea, she was banned for it was like gangster related stuff."
00:26:52,00:26:53,What?
00:26:53,00:26:54,I haven't seen that episode.
00:26:54,00:26:55,I know.
00:26:55,00:26:56,I just pulled that from somewhere.
00:26:56,00:26:58,Is it because she has a different number of digits?
00:26:58,00:26:59,Yes.
00:26:59,00:27:00,Who was that?
00:27:00,00:27:01,That was banned.
00:27:01,00:27:05,Was that postman Pat or someone like that who got banned because they were like the Yakuza
00:27:05,00:27:06,with four fingers?
00:27:06,00:27:10,I know there's one episode of Bluey you can't watch in America.
00:27:10,00:27:11,"Oh, yeah."
00:27:11,00:27:12,Why?
00:27:12,00:27:13,Can you guess why in fact?
00:27:13,00:27:14,Okay.
00:27:14,00:27:20,So we all know Bluey is the amazing kids show and it's about two dog parents and two dog
00:27:20,00:27:21,kids.
00:27:21,00:27:22,Yeah.
00:27:22,00:27:30,"Anti gun, Bluey wants a gun and they say, no Bluey, no T, no guns."
00:27:30,00:27:31,It's close.
00:27:31,00:27:32,In fairness.
00:27:32,00:27:36,"Oh, what else do Americans do? The death penalty. Was it death, the death penalty one where"
00:27:36,00:27:37,they execute?
00:27:37,00:27:38,Yeah.
00:27:38,00:27:39,Bandit was executed.
00:27:39,00:27:40,Yeah.
00:27:40,00:27:43,"No, it's not that."
00:27:43,00:27:48,"What it is, is there's an episode where Bandit, who's the dad that gives birth or it looks"
00:27:48,00:27:50,like he's giving birth to a baby.
00:27:50,00:27:51,"Oh, yeah."
00:27:51,00:27:56,"And it's not really happening, but it's, he kind of finds himself in this position where"
00:27:56,00:28:00,he's laid down in a paddling pool and it looks like he's giving birth.
00:28:00,00:28:06,"And I think in America, they thought that this wasn't evidence of like a typical family"
00:28:06,00:28:08,because the man was giving birth.
00:28:08,00:28:09,But he wasn't giving birth.
00:28:09,00:28:10,"No, he wasn't."
00:28:10,00:28:11,"But like, it's not always."
00:28:11,00:28:14,You can't be lost in the plot of Bluey.
00:28:14,00:28:18,"I guess when people complain about these things, they're not always completely using"
00:28:18,00:28:19,excellent logic.
00:28:19,00:28:20,Their brains.
00:28:20,00:28:21,Yeah.
00:28:21,00:28:23,Putting in their head.
00:28:23,00:28:25,So animals are still a guang habi.
00:28:25,00:28:31,"Well, with public executions, like kind of they were initially done to sort of demonstrate"
00:28:31,00:28:33,"like the power of the crown, right?"
00:28:33,00:28:37,"Like they would have, they were quite theatrical, like quite dramatic."
00:28:37,00:28:43,"Like they would do stuff like, you know, someone receiving a pardon at the 11th hour and people"
00:28:43,00:28:48,"would broaden in a carriage, like all extremely performative."
00:28:48,00:28:52,"And one of the reasons that public executions was phased out, there were many of them."
00:28:52,00:28:59,"But because people were given the ability to say last words, people started really liking"
00:28:59,00:29:00,the criminals.
00:29:00,00:29:04,"So like they'd either be like, oh, no, I'm so sorry."
00:29:04,00:29:07,"And they'd be like, oh, bloody hell, this, this seems better."
00:29:07,00:29:09,I wouldn't want to be executed.
00:29:09,00:29:13,"Or they'd be sort of cavalier and be like, I did it and I do it again."
00:29:13,00:29:17,And then they sort of became like folk heroes.
00:29:17,00:29:21,"So well, and it just leads me to think like, was the pink given an opportunity to give"
00:29:21,00:29:23,some last words?
00:29:23,00:29:28,"I'm trying to think what noise a pig could make to make the crowd go, oh, hang on, hang"
00:29:28,00:29:29,on.
00:29:29,00:29:30,That's all folks.
00:29:30,00:29:31,Presumably.
00:29:31,00:29:32,You're right.
00:29:32,00:29:36,So animals are still getting arrested all around the world.
00:29:36,00:29:37,Oh yeah.
00:29:37,00:29:43,"In Mumbai last year, there was a pigeon who was arrested because they had some Chinese"
00:29:43,00:29:48,words written on their body and they thought it must be a spy.
00:29:48,00:29:49,What were the words?
00:29:49,00:29:50,Was it just?
00:29:50,00:29:52,Cook this side up or something?
00:29:52,00:29:57,"No, it was more like sort of belonging to Taiwan Pigeon Racing Society."
00:29:57,00:29:58,Right.
00:29:58,00:30:00,But the people who captured it couldn't read it.
00:30:00,00:30:05,So they assumed it was what kind of planes were making it in India or something like
00:30:05,00:30:06,that.
00:30:06,00:30:07,"Google translate, guys."
00:30:07,00:30:08,Just take a photo.
00:30:08,00:30:09,Google translate.
00:30:09,00:30:10,Just make sure.
00:30:10,00:30:11,Here's another one.
00:30:11,00:30:17,"A few years ago, there were 14 squirrels arrested in Iran who were accused of espionage for"
00:30:17,00:30:18,the United States.
00:30:18,00:30:19,Oh yeah.
00:30:19,00:30:26,And apparently what was said was that they had little sort of electronic devices on them.
00:30:26,00:30:29,Perhaps they were listening in or something like that.
00:30:29,00:30:31,And then we never really heard anything else about it.
00:30:31,00:30:34,"A few journalists asked the head of police and he said, ""Oh, I don't know anything about"
00:30:34,00:30:35,"that."""
00:30:35,00:30:41,And basically experts have said that it would be a pretty stupid idea to use squirrels as
00:30:41,00:30:45,spies because they're extremely unreliable and they tend to just run off wherever they
00:30:45,00:30:46,want.
00:30:46,00:30:49,"And many, many problems with using them as spies, I would say."
00:30:49,00:30:50,Yeah.
00:30:50,00:30:51,"They have terrible memories, don't they?"
00:30:51,00:30:54,Don't they bury their nuts and forget where they've buried them?
00:30:54,00:30:55,"And that's how trees grow, basically."
00:30:55,00:30:58,That's how we have trees on our planet is just because squirrels don't know where dinner
00:30:58,00:30:59,has been buried.
00:30:59,00:31:00,Come on.
00:31:00,00:31:02,They bury a lot of nuts.
00:31:02,00:31:06,"If you buried a thousand nuts, would you remember every single one's location, Dan?"
00:31:06,00:31:09,I'd probably pick one location to put all my nuts in.
00:31:09,00:31:12,"Well, that's your problem, Dan, isn't it?"
00:31:12,00:31:16,That's like the Dan Shriver squirrel would have died out because it just takes one person
00:31:16,00:31:19,to find that cache of nuts and you have no nuts left.
00:31:19,00:31:24,"Oh, they wouldn't find it and I would have a mega tree, the biggest tree ever."
00:31:24,00:31:26,"Oh, my nuts combined."
00:31:26,00:31:30,"Hey, I read just while I was reading up on pigs and seeing the trouble they get into"
00:31:30,00:31:34,"and so on, I came across something I've never heard of before, which is the pig toilet."
00:31:34,00:31:35,You guys heard of a pig toilet?
00:31:35,00:31:38,"I don't know if I want to know, but go on."
00:31:38,00:31:40,"I'll tell you, you don't, but I've got to say it anyway."
00:31:40,00:31:47,"This is done in farms in China and other bits of Asia where pigs basically eat everything,"
00:31:47,00:31:49,including human feces.
00:31:49,00:31:56,And so what it is is it's a toilet whereby a tube is attached where the feces goes down
00:31:56,00:31:59,and it lands in a big bowl for the pigs to eat.
00:31:59,00:32:03,"It's their food bowl, basically, is the end of a human toilet."
00:32:03,00:32:05,"It's a real thing, the pig toilet."
00:32:05,00:32:08,"If that was me, I would maul a child to death."
00:32:08,00:32:09,Yeah.
00:32:09,00:32:11,That's what I'm saying.
00:32:11,00:32:15,"If I was the defense lawyer, I'd open with that."
00:32:15,00:32:16,Maybe stop shitting in its food bowl.
00:32:16,00:32:17,Maybe.
00:32:17,00:32:20,Maybe that's the start of the problem.
00:32:20,00:32:22,It's the real animals here.
00:32:22,00:32:24,Yeah.
00:32:24,00:32:25,We need to wrap up.
00:32:25,00:32:27,"Abby, tell us about your Edinburgh show."
00:32:27,00:32:28,Where are you going to be?
00:32:28,00:32:29,Hello.
00:32:29,00:32:32,"Yes, I'm coming to Edinburgh all the way from New Zealand."
00:32:32,00:32:33,What the heck?
00:32:33,00:32:36,And I'm doing a show called Welcome to My Dream.
00:32:36,00:32:42,And I'm at Assembly in Studio 4 at 6.40 every single day.
00:32:42,00:32:49,"And my show is about mainly, honestly, my enemies and people that have crossed me."
00:32:49,00:32:54,"And I'm really brave and don't confront them to their face, but talk about it in a comedy"
00:32:54,00:32:55,show.
00:32:55,00:32:56,On the other side of the world.
00:32:56,00:32:57,Yes.
00:32:57,00:33:02,My enemies include a local improv troupe and a museum of optical illusions that I'm in
00:33:02,00:33:09,a public queue with.
00:33:09,00:33:17,"OK, it's time for fact number three, and that is Uruj Ashfaq."
00:33:17,00:33:18,Hi.
00:33:18,00:33:23,"My fact is that emotional tears have more protein in them, so they fall slow."
00:33:23,00:33:27,And it's bi-designed so that our tribe can see us cry and comfort us.
00:33:27,00:33:28,Very clever.
00:33:28,00:33:33,"I'm vaguely aware that there are different kinds of tears, but I didn't think they were"
00:33:33,00:33:36,made of different things.
00:33:36,00:33:40,So there are three different types of tears.
00:33:40,00:33:44,"There is basil, which is just the oily layer that we have on our eyelids to keep it from"
00:33:44,00:33:45,drying out.
00:33:45,00:33:50,"There's reflex, which is when we're cutting onions or there's some dust in our eyes."
00:33:50,00:33:54,So those fall really quickly to flesh away any irritants.
00:33:54,00:33:59,"And then there are emotional tears, and they have the highest amount of protein levels,"
00:33:59,00:34:02,"so they fall slower, and they look more dramatic and sad."
00:34:02,00:34:03,So good.
00:34:03,00:34:09,"I think it's amazing, and when you know this, you can see it, I think, like if you see someone"
00:34:09,00:34:13,"and there are tears coming down their face, the difference between, ""Oh, I've got something"
00:34:13,00:34:18,"in my eye,"" and, ""Oh, I'm really upset and I need to be comforted,"" you can actually"
00:34:18,00:34:19,see them going slower down the face.
00:34:19,00:34:20,They seem more viscous.
00:34:20,00:34:24,I'm really going to look out for that.
00:34:24,00:34:27,"So actually, we shouldn't say when people are upset, the tears were streaming down his"
00:34:27,00:34:28,face.
00:34:28,00:34:34,"We just say the tears were crawling slowly down his face, although I think with onions,"
00:34:34,00:34:39,"I kind of want sympathy when I'm cutting onions, I could do some slow tears to draw more attention"
00:34:39,00:34:40,to it.
00:34:40,00:34:42,It doesn't say anywhere that you have to pick one.
00:34:42,00:34:44,You could just cry them all at the same time.
00:34:44,00:34:47,All three.
00:34:47,00:34:55,"I was looking at the origins of why we cry due to emotion, and there's a theory, and"
00:34:55,00:34:56,I love this so much.
00:34:56,00:34:57,It's by a Dutch psychologist.
00:34:57,00:35:00,"He's called Advinge Hoortz, and he spent 20 years working on tears."
00:35:00,00:35:05,"So he does, he knows his onions, sorry."
00:35:05,00:35:12,"What he thinks is that it's an accident that we associate tears with emotion, right?"
00:35:12,00:35:18,"So when infants are wailing, because infants do naturally wail if they're in distress,"
00:35:18,00:35:22,"they will squeeze the muscles around their eyes as part of the wailing, and that puts"
00:35:22,00:35:28,pressure on the eyeball so tears happened originally as a kind of reflex.
00:35:28,00:35:31,"And then that became a signal of neediness by children, and we don't really control those"
00:35:31,00:35:35,"muscles, which is why it's relatively hard to fake crying."
00:35:35,00:35:39,"And then it evolved naturally, because it turned out it was useful evolutionarily, because"
00:35:39,00:35:40,"people can see you crying, they comfort you."
00:35:40,00:35:41,I think that's it.
00:35:41,00:35:42,Yeah.
00:35:42,00:35:43,That's interesting.
00:35:43,00:35:49,"Wouldn't it be nice if babies cried in like harmonies, but they always cry in this really"
00:35:49,00:35:53,annoying discordant sound.
00:35:53,00:35:57,"And of course, that is also an evolutionary thing, because if they made a nice tune when"
00:35:57,00:36:00,"they cried, no one would ever come to their help."
00:36:00,00:36:05,But the interesting thing is like that this sound that they make is actually very similar
00:36:05,00:36:07,to loads of different animals.
00:36:07,00:36:11,And loads of different animals make very similar crying sounds.
00:36:11,00:36:16,"That's why when the foxes are having sex in my back garden, I think that my baby's upset."
00:36:16,00:36:22,"Well, she doesn't like, she doesn't like to see that sort of thing."
00:36:22,00:36:26,"And you do make us leap in the garden, so that's what I suppose all the time."
00:36:26,00:36:31,"The really interesting thing is if you get the sound of a baby seal crying, for instance,"
00:36:31,00:36:36,"and you play that to a mother deer, then the deer will react as if it's one of her children"
00:36:36,00:36:38,who's sick.
00:36:38,00:36:44,I wonder what would happen if you played me crying to a baby seal or a mother deer.
00:36:44,00:36:47,"I think it's the same, because it's a very similar sound."
00:36:47,00:36:52,"So they would think, and there's one theory that actually the reason that all everyone"
00:36:52,00:36:57,"evolved the same way is because then animals can help each other, but I don't, I think"
00:36:57,00:36:58,that's it.
00:36:58,00:36:59,"Well, who did that study?"
00:36:59,00:37:00,Disney?
00:37:00,00:37:01,Come on.
00:37:01,00:37:03,Is that the Snow White Institute?
00:37:03,00:37:07,"Arouge, are you familiar with Sad Bait?"
00:37:07,00:37:11,I was reading about the specifically Indian phenomenon of crying videos where lots of
00:37:11,00:37:15,influencers will lip-sync and cry along to audio from movies.
00:37:15,00:37:18,"And in about 2017, this was a huge deal."
00:37:18,00:37:25,"I think you know more than me at this point, but I think the second acting showreel almost,"
00:37:25,00:37:26,right?
00:37:26,00:37:27,Yes.
00:37:27,00:37:29,"Is it a sad scene or is it like, you know, the song Prince Ali in Aladdin?"
00:37:29,00:37:30,"No, it's sad, it's sad."
00:37:30,00:37:34,It's like Bambi's mum dying or something.
00:37:34,00:37:35,People got famous.
00:37:35,00:37:39,"I mean, there was a kid called Saga Goswami who set up a TikTok in 2017 and basically"
00:37:39,00:37:43,became wealthy and famous off the back of crying along to images.
00:37:43,00:37:44,Yeah.
00:37:44,00:37:45,And the government banned it.
00:37:45,00:37:46,Yes.
00:37:46,00:37:47,"The ban TikTok, yeah."
00:37:47,00:37:49,Did they ban it because of the crying videos?
00:37:49,00:37:51,They just thought this is a real downer.
00:37:51,00:37:54,This is bombing the whole country out.
00:37:54,00:37:58,"Are you thinking this could be something where you could make your fortune, Andy?"
00:37:58,00:38:00,"Well, I'm always on the lookout for content."
00:38:00,00:38:01,You know me.
00:38:01,00:38:02,"I'm content, content, content."
00:38:02,00:38:06,"And I cry a lot, so let's marry these."
00:38:06,00:38:09,One of the problems with studying crying and its effect and tears in their effect is that
00:38:09,00:38:13,it's quite hard to make study participants cry on demand.
00:38:13,00:38:16,So do you guys think you could cry on demand?
00:38:16,00:38:17,I could.
00:38:17,00:38:18,Could you?
00:38:18,00:38:19,Really?
00:38:19,00:38:20,What would it take if they showed you a sad film?
00:38:20,00:38:21,You'd be up for it.
00:38:21,00:38:22,Yes.
00:38:22,00:38:24,Just let me be by myself for a bit.
00:38:24,00:38:26,I think I could get into it.
00:38:26,00:38:31,Gharuj will you always on the verge of tears anyway?
00:38:31,00:38:34,That actually makes me quite tense here now.
00:38:34,00:38:37,"Have you ever done any acting, Gharuj, where you have to cry?"
00:38:37,00:38:41,"In my stand-up bits, I have a whole bit about crying, actually."
00:38:41,00:38:45,"So I almost pretend to cry on stage and everyone was like, ""Oh, my God, is she really going"
00:38:45,00:38:46,"to cry?"""
00:38:46,00:38:50,"And I said, ""No, this is just yours and yours of practice."""
00:38:50,00:38:51,What is your trick?
00:38:51,00:38:53,It's like you think of a sad thing or?
00:38:53,00:38:54,Yes.
00:38:54,00:38:59,"I tend to really make myself cry, I think, of a sad thing, but otherwise, I just make"
00:38:59,00:39:04,"my crying face, which I have a lot of practice of, because I'd be honest, when you cry as"
00:39:04,00:39:09,"much as I do, you do end up looking in the mirror every once in a while, and you're like,"
00:39:09,00:39:10,"""What am I looking like right now?"""
00:39:10,00:39:13,Have you ever done that?
00:39:13,00:39:14,Lots in the mirror and cried.
00:39:14,00:39:15,James is a glubber.
00:39:15,00:39:18,James lets on that he's one of the strong and silent types actually.
00:39:18,00:39:22,He's incredibly in touch with his feelings.
00:39:22,00:39:23,I am.
00:39:23,00:39:25,"As soon as the zoom goes off, I'm going to be in the garden."
00:39:25,00:39:28,The foxes won't know what's going on.
00:39:28,00:39:32,"I am interested by how people make other people cry, though, because there was quite a famous"
00:39:32,00:39:38,"study about how female tears make men less aggressive, which is quite interesting."
00:39:38,00:39:45,"And they got 25 men to smell vials of tears that women had cried out, and they found that"
00:39:45,00:39:50,"they were 44% less aggressive in video games afterwards, whatever they were playing, Golden"
00:39:50,00:39:53,Eye or Diddy Kong Racing or whatever.
00:39:53,00:39:57,"And they got 100 women to come and donate tears, and only six of them could produce"
00:39:57,00:39:59,the necessary amount.
00:39:59,00:40:00,Really?
00:40:00,00:40:01,Yeah.
00:40:01,00:40:03,"So I really, you know, you could volunteer yourself for science, Erush."
00:40:03,00:40:04,That would be great.
00:40:04,00:40:09,"And I'm always crying because of men anyway, so it's like a full circle."
00:40:09,00:40:15,"I was looking into what makes Americans cry, and the circumstances under which they cry."
00:40:15,00:40:21,"Have you ever cried at home, at a funeral, in your car, that kind of stuff?"
00:40:21,00:40:25,"I mean, all of it, in every single category, women say they cry more than men, or have"
00:40:25,00:40:27,cried more than men in that circumstance.
00:40:27,00:40:32,But the top five reasons that Americans say would make them cry would be the death of
00:40:32,00:40:37,"a loved one, the death of a pet, feeling extremely sad, saying goodbye to a loved one before a"
00:40:37,00:40:41,"long separation, and chopping onions."
00:40:41,00:40:45,"And then chopping onions came before speaking about an emotional subject, watching a sad"
00:40:45,00:40:49,"movie, and witnessing injustice or cruelty."
00:40:49,00:40:52,It could be that they just really like onions.
00:40:52,00:40:54,What about sporting events?
00:40:54,00:40:56,"That's the only time when I feel emotional, really."
00:40:56,00:41:00,"Oh yeah, actually, the Wimbledon Women's Tennis Final, I was almost crying along in sympathy"
00:41:00,00:41:01,this year.
00:41:01,00:41:04,That was a tough watch.
00:41:04,00:41:13,"I read that in 17th century America, if the bride didn't cry, like furiously cry, when"
00:41:13,00:41:18,"she was getting married, they would accuse her of being a witch, because they believed"
00:41:18,00:41:23,that a witch could only shed three tears at a time through her left eye.
00:41:23,00:41:24,Oh wow.
00:41:24,00:41:25,It's so specific.
00:41:25,00:41:27,"So not only do you have to cry, you've got to make sure that right eye cries."
00:41:27,00:41:28,Yes.
00:41:28,00:41:30,"I mean, the wedding is a happy occasion."
00:41:30,00:41:31,Should you be sobbing your heart out?
00:41:31,00:41:33,"Tears of happiness, Anna."
00:41:33,00:41:34,Tears of happiness.
00:41:34,00:41:35,Yeah.
00:41:35,00:41:38,"I think to be safe, you'd have to make sure you married an absolute bastard so you could"
00:41:38,00:41:40,guarantee crying on your wedding day.
00:41:40,00:41:43,Have you guys heard of tear catchers?
00:41:43,00:41:45,These are really cool.
00:41:45,00:41:46,No.
00:41:46,00:41:47,No.
00:41:47,00:41:50,So they're a little bit of glass that you put underneath your eyes.
00:41:50,00:41:54,"They first made in ancient Persia, but the Romans had them as well."
00:41:54,00:42:00,"And the idea was, let's say I went away on a trip, we were touring Australia or something,"
00:42:00,00:42:05,I would give my wife one of these and she would keep it underneath her eyes.
00:42:05,00:42:09,"And then when I came back, I'd be able to see how many tears she'd made because she"
00:42:09,00:42:11,was so upset that I was on top.
00:42:11,00:42:12,Come on.
00:42:12,00:42:14,How many wives desperately filling it up with a tap?
00:42:14,00:42:18,But that was a real thing and even the Victorians had them.
00:42:18,00:42:21,"So you know, we're quite unusual that we don't have them."
00:42:21,00:42:24,"So I was looking at like, you know, crying behaviors around the world in different cultures"
00:42:24,00:42:31,"and the bow people of the Andaman Islands, who I think do not exist anymore, but they"
00:42:31,00:42:35,used to until the early 20th century in the late 1800s.
00:42:35,00:42:40,"If you were separated from your bow friend or family member for a long time, when you"
00:42:40,00:42:46,"were reunited, the way that you celebrated that is you sat apart and completely ignored"
00:42:46,00:42:50,"each other for like a full day, hours and hours, a full day."
00:42:50,00:42:54,"And then as soon as dusk fell, you turned around and you flung your arms around each"
00:42:54,00:42:56,other and you cried for an hour.
00:42:56,00:42:57,Wow.
00:42:57,00:42:58,Interesting.
00:42:58,00:42:59,Yeah.
00:42:59,00:43:01,"Very, very choreographed reunion."
00:43:01,00:43:06,"It's a bit like coming home to a dog, though, isn't it, which you've not seen for a while."
00:43:06,00:43:10,"They will pretend for a while, they hate that you can."
00:43:10,00:43:17,"Anna, can I ask if after about 56 minutes of you crying, is it a faux pas to be checking"
00:43:17,00:43:21,your watch?
00:43:21,00:43:23,"Yeah, I think you're in serious trouble."
00:43:23,00:43:25,I think you kicked off the island.
00:43:25,00:43:28,Do you know that tears are like fingerprints?
00:43:28,00:43:33,"So everyone has completely different tears, but that's very rarely useful in a burglary"
00:43:33,00:43:34,investigation.
00:43:34,00:43:38,That's why I always leave Bambion when I leave the house.
00:43:38,00:43:42,I just make sure that any burglars had a bit of a week.
00:43:42,00:43:46,"But yeah, because they all have different organic substances, different molecular makeup."
00:43:46,00:43:51,"You could just plant evidence then, you just make somebody cry, collect their tears and"
00:43:51,00:43:54,then leave it at the scene of the crime.
00:43:54,00:43:55,Really good idea.
00:43:55,00:43:56,Yeah.
00:43:56,00:44:00,I think we'll edit this so I can actually use it in real life and they can't trace
00:44:00,00:44:04,it back to me.
00:44:04,00:44:05,Mouse tears are erotic.
00:44:05,00:44:07,"Oh yeah, I always said it."
00:44:07,00:44:10,"Yeah, look, we all knew it."
00:44:10,00:44:12,"It's two other mice, but it is quite cool."
00:44:12,00:44:18,"These male mouse tears, so they cry and they lubricate their eyebrows."
00:44:18,00:44:20,Her eyebrows?
00:44:20,00:44:21,No?
00:44:21,00:44:22,Their eyeballs.
00:44:22,00:44:26,Everyone loves a wet eyebrow.
00:44:26,00:44:29,And then they spread their tears around their body and they groom themselves with them.
00:44:29,00:44:33,And they found out that if a male mouse is crying and spreading its tears around its body
00:44:33,00:44:38,"and the female mouse comes into contact with it, she will engage in laudosis, which has"
00:44:38,00:44:42,"always been one of my favorite words, which is where a female mouse or animal raises their"
00:44:42,00:44:49,"rump up to say, do come in."
00:44:49,00:44:52,"You have that on the little mat outside your front door, don't you, Anna?"
00:44:52,00:44:56,The picture of me just bending over my bum out.
00:44:56,00:44:57,Yeah.
00:44:57,00:45:01,That's sort of refreshing because men have the opposite reaction to my tears.
00:45:01,00:45:02,They leave.
00:45:02,00:45:04,"They're like, bye, this is good."
00:45:04,00:45:07,"No, that's them showing you their bottom."
00:45:07,00:45:08,You've just misinterpreted.
00:45:08,00:45:13,"You know, they're saying, all right, we should wrap up."
00:45:13,00:45:18,"But before you go, Arouge, I believe you're going to be in Edinburgh and not just hanging"
00:45:18,00:45:20,"out there doing a show, correct?"
00:45:20,00:45:21,Yes.
00:45:21,00:45:23,I'm doing my solo show.
00:45:23,00:45:30,"It's called How to be a Baddie from 30th July to 24th August, 625 p.m. at the Monkey"
00:45:30,00:45:31,Barrel.
00:45:31,00:45:36,I will be a bad girl at the fringe this August.
00:45:36,00:45:38,Thank you so much for coming on.
00:45:38,00:45:39,Great to talk crying.
00:45:39,00:45:43,"We're all sobbing now, obviously."
00:45:43,00:45:52,"OK, it's time for our final fact of the show, and that is Nish Kumar."
00:45:52,00:45:58,"In 1967, for eight dates, Jimi Hendrix supported the Monkeys on tour in the United States"
00:45:58,00:45:59,of America.
00:45:59,00:46:03,What a privilege for him.
00:46:03,00:46:07,I was trying to come up with an analogy of who it's like supporting whom these days.
00:46:07,00:46:13,Is it like Leonard Cohen supporting Sabrina Carpenter or something?
00:46:13,00:46:18,Maybe it's like Kendrick Lamar opening for the Wiggles or something.
00:46:18,00:46:22,"Maybe we're being a tad unkind to the Monkeys, who did, you know, in spite of the fact that"
00:46:22,00:46:27,"they were sort of a confected band for a television show, definitely had sort of some musical"
00:46:27,00:46:31,"talent, not that I'm denigrating the musicianship of the Wiggles."
00:46:31,00:46:32,Thank you.
00:46:32,00:46:34,"I was biting my tongue there, but yeah."
00:46:34,00:46:35,Kendrick and the Wiggles.
00:46:35,00:46:36,Are you kidding me?
00:46:36,00:46:37,I'm just kidding.
00:46:37,00:46:41,"So, who is this Jimi Hendrix guy?"
00:46:41,00:46:42,I think we should get into that.
00:46:42,00:46:43,Yeah.
00:46:43,00:46:44,Who the hell is this Jimi Hendrix man?
00:46:44,00:46:45,Yes.
00:46:45,00:46:48,"And actually, he wasn't the biggest thing in the world then, was he?"
00:46:48,00:46:49,No.
00:46:49,00:46:50,In 1967.
00:46:50,00:46:51,Yeah.
00:46:51,00:46:55,"He did this famous performance at the Monterey Festival of Pop, because he is American, had"
00:46:55,00:47:01,"been in America for years and years, then in '66, he's performing on his own after having"
00:47:01,00:47:05,spent a couple of years as a kind of sideman playing in clubs across the South.
00:47:05,00:47:10,"He's then in Greenwich Village performing kind of with backup musicians, but on his own at"
00:47:10,00:47:16,"the cafe where in New York, Chaz Chandler, the recently ex-bassist of the animals, sees"
00:47:16,00:47:21,"Hendrix and thinks, right, I'm taking this guy to England, I'm going to find two British"
00:47:21,00:47:25,"musicians to back him up in London, and then we're going to put together a band."
00:47:25,00:47:26,That happens.
00:47:26,00:47:31,"And then from total obscurity, he becomes the hottest thing in London."
00:47:31,00:47:33,McCartney recommends him to the Monterey Festival of Pop.
00:47:33,00:47:37,He then goes to the Monterey Festival of Pop and sort of gives one of the kind of seminal
00:47:37,00:47:44,"performances in the development of popular music, because he, you know, he's a fusion"
00:47:44,00:47:49,of psychedelic rock and a lot of that was accelerated by new guitar pedal effects that
00:47:49,00:47:53,were coming through that he was often the first person to actually have access to.
00:47:53,00:47:59,"But he creates this kind of sound that fuses psychedelic rock with some very, very traditional"
00:47:59,00:48:01,orthodox blues music.
00:48:01,00:48:05,"And you know, he's dressed in a way that no rock star has dressed."
00:48:05,00:48:11,"And then at the end of this performance, he does a cover of Wild Thing by the Trugs,"
00:48:11,00:48:15,and then he sets fire to and destroys his guitar on stage.
00:48:15,00:48:17,"Oh, is that the moment?"
00:48:17,00:48:21,"The performance is extraordinary, because also, you know, it's a hippie crowd."
00:48:21,00:48:25,"They sort of, when he sings, he's got a very beautiful, delicate song called ""The Wind"
00:48:25,00:48:26,"cries Mary."""
00:48:26,00:48:30,"And the hippie crowd is very enchanted, and then people are just very quickly horrified"
00:48:30,00:48:35,"as he lets not be around the bush, simulates sex with his guitar for an uncomfortably long"
00:48:35,00:48:36,amount of time.
00:48:36,00:48:39,And then sets it on fire and smashes it on the stage.
00:48:39,00:48:44,"And the monkeys are watching, and they think, ""This is the support act we've been looking"
00:48:44,00:48:47,"for for when we played Last Train to Clarksville."""
00:48:47,00:48:51,"Well, Mickey Delence, who's in the monkeys, that was the second time he saw him."
00:48:51,00:48:57,"So he actually saw Hendrix in America, Greenwich Village, I think, and he saw him playing with"
00:48:57,00:48:58,his teeth.
00:48:58,00:49:00,"That was amazing, but he didn't get his name."
00:49:00,00:49:02,"So when they were at the gig, they were like, ""He was like, ""That's the teeth guy."
00:49:02,00:49:04,"We've got to get him."""
00:49:04,00:49:07,"And to be fair to the monkeys, they knew their place in rock music, and they knew what his"
00:49:07,00:49:09,emerging place might be.
00:49:09,00:49:15,"They thought, ""Won't it be awesome to get to watch Jimi Hendrix every night on tour?"""
00:49:15,00:49:16,That's what they wanted.
00:49:16,00:49:17,You said it was for seven or eight nights.
00:49:17,00:49:20,"So presumably, this was not one of the great marriages of the orchestra."
00:49:20,00:49:26,"No, so it sort of became quite quickly apparent that this was a mismatch, even though, as you"
00:49:26,00:49:32,"say, Dan, the monkeys were real Hendrix fans, and so would often sneak into the audience"
00:49:32,00:49:39,just so that they could watch him perform to an audience of monkeys fans who were increasingly
00:49:39,00:49:40,frustrated.
00:49:40,00:49:46,"Well, apparently, one of the things that is said about the concert is that when he tried"
00:49:46,00:49:53,"to get them to sing ""Foxy Lady,"" they would yell back ""Foxy Davy,"" after Davy Jones,"
00:49:53,00:49:55,one of the members of the monkeys.
00:49:55,00:49:59,"Yeah, it was not a solid artistic match."
00:49:59,00:50:04,"But also, Hendrix had some experience of doing this kind of thing, because he had opened"
00:50:04,00:50:11,"for Engelbert Humperding in England the year before, because, you know, I guess at various"
00:50:11,00:50:16,"points you're sort of, you know, especially at that time where the kind of touring circuit"
00:50:16,00:50:20,"was just starting, there just weren't that many musicians that fit into the category"
00:50:20,00:50:22,of popular music.
00:50:22,00:50:28,"We hadn't yet managed to silo everything off by Jobra, but I think the issue is almost"
00:50:28,00:50:34,"that the monkeys' audience was children and their parents, and I think that that is the"
00:50:34,00:50:39,"thing that kind of, that's the thing that creates the issue."
00:50:39,00:50:44,"And he wasn't a big fan, apparently he referred to their music as dishwater, so that's not"
00:50:44,00:50:46,"the best compliment, if true."
00:50:46,00:50:52,"So he's looking down, he disdains this audience so much who disdain him in return, and then"
00:50:52,00:50:55,"they basically shout each other off the stage, don't they?"
00:50:55,00:50:59,"He just eventually said, ""Sod this, these guys hate me, I hate them."""
00:50:59,00:51:00,Really?
00:51:00,00:51:04,"Yeah, listen, I'll say this from personal experience, I know what it's like to have"
00:51:04,00:51:05,a bad gig.
00:51:05,00:51:12,"I've had a few bad gigs in my time, and I know what it looks like when an audience"
00:51:12,00:51:17,"turns on a performer, and let me tell you, it's not pretty when it's 30 people, but I"
00:51:17,00:51:20,"imagine when it's 10,000 people."
00:51:20,00:51:27,"Yeah, those Wiggles crowds are tough, man, they are hard to win over."
00:51:27,00:51:31,"You know you mentioned the ""Wing cries Mary,"" which, I agree, is a really lovely song."
00:51:31,00:51:35,"I didn't realise what that was about, and it's just about lumpy mashed potato."
00:51:35,00:51:36,Is it?
00:51:36,00:51:37,Stop it.
00:51:37,00:51:41,"Yeah, it's just about he had a fight with his girlfriend, Kathy Mary Etchingham, apparently"
00:51:41,00:51:45,"they had fights a lot, and again, you always picture some like Jimi Hendrix, they've got"
00:51:45,00:51:49,to be having these really passionate fights about huge issues.
00:51:49,00:51:55,"No, the thing they always thought about was her shit cooking, and in 1967, he had a big"
00:51:55,00:51:57,bitch about her lumpy mashed potatoes.
00:51:57,00:52:01,"She stormed out, smashed some plates, and the ""Wing cries Mary"" is the song he wrote"
00:52:01,00:52:02,that night.
00:52:02,00:52:09,It has the lyric about picking up broken pieces on the floor and sweeping up the bits of plate.
00:52:09,00:52:10,"There we go, that's all it is."
00:52:10,00:52:11,That's great.
00:52:11,00:52:13,"Nish, I'm taking you're a mega fan, right?"
00:52:13,00:52:15,From everything you've said so far.
00:52:15,00:52:18,"Yeah, I'm a big Jimi Hendrix fan."
00:52:18,00:52:22,"So the first album I ever bought was a Jimi Hendrix album, which was great."
00:52:22,00:52:24,That's a great first album to have bought.
00:52:24,00:52:31,"The first single was ""Bewitched,"" so I thought, ""Wow, it's a mixed grill, my taste."""
00:52:31,00:52:34,"Oh, the monkey's kind of influenced that."
00:52:34,00:52:35,Yeah.
00:52:35,00:52:38,"But the thing I love and the thing I never knew, and I find this really interesting because"
00:52:38,00:52:42,"it's my other area of interest, is that he was a paratrooper."
00:52:42,00:52:48,"He was signed into the US Army, the 101st Airborne Division of the US Army, because there was"
00:52:48,00:52:51,"a minor misdemeanor and the judge said, ""Well, you've got to join the Army if you want to"
00:52:51,00:52:53,"avoid prison."""
00:52:53,00:53:00,"So theoretically, if the TV series Band of Brothers had been set not in 1944, but in"
00:53:00,00:53:06,"the early '60s, Jimi Hendrix could have been a character in that series."
00:53:06,00:53:09,A fantasy world you can both inhabit.
00:53:09,00:53:14,"Yeah, but you know the plotline to that would then involve the truth, which is that he then"
00:53:14,00:53:16,pretends to be gay to get out of it.
00:53:16,00:53:17,Yes.
00:53:17,00:53:18,He was dishonorably discharged.
00:53:18,00:53:19,Yeah.
00:53:19,00:53:23,"For a comic subplot in Band of Brothers, which gets a bit heavy at times, I would say."
00:53:23,00:53:26,Here's a thing that I was surprised about with Jimi Hendrix.
00:53:26,00:53:31,"He's obviously the epitome of cool, of psychedelia, of that whole period."
00:53:31,00:53:35,"But when you read into him, actually quite sort of a mundane, boring character."
00:53:35,00:53:36,He loved playing risk.
00:53:36,00:53:41,"Graham Nash of Crosby Stills and Nash said that he was amazing at risk, particularly"
00:53:41,00:53:42,when he was on LSD.
00:53:42,00:53:44,That's his military experience coming in.
00:53:44,00:53:45,It is.
00:53:45,00:53:46,"It's like, ""No, I wouldn't go that way."""
00:53:46,00:53:47,Yeah.
00:53:47,00:53:48,Straight ahead of five of you.
00:53:48,00:53:53,But he was also a massive fan of Coronation Street.
00:53:53,00:53:54,Like a huge fan.
00:53:54,00:53:55,Really?
00:53:55,00:53:56,Yeah.
00:53:56,00:53:59,"So, according to his girlfriend, who you mentioned, and Kathy."
00:53:59,00:54:00,"Kathy, yeah."
00:54:00,00:54:01,Yeah.
00:54:01,00:54:03,She says that he just absolutely binged Coronation Street.
00:54:03,00:54:08,And there's a theory that the theme tune found its way into one of his songs.
00:54:08,00:54:12,"And if you listen, and I've had to listen just before we came on, on Axis Baldur's"
00:54:12,00:54:16,"Love, there is a song called Third Stone from the Sun."
00:54:16,00:54:17,Have a listen.
00:54:17,00:54:19,42 seconds into it.
00:54:19,00:54:22,"There's a little riff and no question, it is Cory."
00:54:22,00:54:24,It is Coronation Street.
00:54:24,00:54:25,That's amazing.
00:54:25,00:54:26,Yeah.
00:54:26,00:54:27,Fantastic.
00:54:27,00:54:30,"All of these amazing artists, like they do have the reputation for the drink."
00:54:30,00:54:33,There was lots of sex and drugs and rock and roll in Hendrix's life.
00:54:33,00:54:36,"But also, they just have to work incredibly hard for years."
00:54:36,00:54:40,"Like Hendrix just did hundreds of hours of recordings, all of this."
00:54:40,00:54:42,"You know, like he worked so hard all the way through."
00:54:42,00:54:48,"And also, he was living in England in the kind of era of what was it, been two television"
00:54:48,00:54:53,"channels or three television channels, like he was not spoiled for choice."
00:54:53,00:54:55,"So he's like, well, I guess Cory's on."
00:54:55,00:54:58,"I've got another Cory link, I think, because I read that he didn't like anyone seeing him"
00:54:58,00:55:01,with his hair curlers in when his hair was being got ready.
00:55:01,00:55:03,"And that's a Cory thing, isn't it?"
00:55:03,00:55:06,They've always got their curlers in.
00:55:06,00:55:09,"It's a tenuous link, but we'll accept it."
00:55:09,00:55:14,"I think he was a bit paranoid about his coolness status, because I read, and I think I verified"
00:55:14,00:55:18,"this, maybe you'll know Nish, but in the song ""If Six Was Nine"", there's a bit where"
00:55:18,00:55:23,"he plays the recorder, and he bought it apparently off a street vendor as kind of a joke."
00:55:23,00:55:25,He plays the recorder at the end.
00:55:25,00:55:26,It's a weird sound.
00:55:26,00:55:29,"There's often chat online saying, ""What's that weird instrument at the end?"""
00:55:29,00:55:32,But it's listed on the original album as a flute.
00:55:32,00:55:33,It's a flute.
00:55:33,00:55:34,"Yeah, it is."
00:55:34,00:55:35,"Apparently, he was embarrassed."
00:55:35,00:55:38,He didn't want to go down as a flute.
00:55:38,00:55:39,He's embarrassed about playing it.
00:55:39,00:55:42,"The problem with it is that as soon as you hear it, you go, ""That's a fucking recorder."""
00:55:42,00:55:43,Like that.
00:55:43,00:55:46,"Like, it doesn't even vaguely sound like a flute."
00:55:46,00:55:47,"Oh, Jimmy."
00:55:47,00:55:48,What's he playing?
00:55:48,00:55:51,"Is it ""London's Burning"" that comes in just over the top?"
00:55:51,00:55:55,"OK, Nish, have you heard the Morgan Freeman thing?"
00:55:55,00:55:56,What?
00:55:56,00:55:57,No.
00:55:57,00:56:00,"Well, Hendricks didn't die in 1970."
00:56:00,00:56:03,"He faked his own death, and since then, he's been living as Morgan Freeman."
00:56:03,00:56:04,What?
00:56:04,00:56:06,"It's a big theory online, yeah."
00:56:06,00:56:07,OK.
00:56:07,00:56:09,Freeman owns a blues bar in Mississippi.
00:56:09,00:56:11,He loves the music of the blues.
00:56:11,00:56:12,Spooky.
00:56:12,00:56:14,They don't look completely dissimilar.
00:56:14,00:56:16,And no one's ever seen Morgan Freeman young.
00:56:16,00:56:20,"Well, Morgan Freeman's first film credit was in 1964, which is six years before Hendricks"
00:56:20,00:56:21,died.
00:56:21,00:56:24,"But if Hendricks had been doing the groundwork, he could have created the character and just"
00:56:24,00:56:27,been slowly starring in movies throughout the '60s.
00:56:27,00:56:29,"I mean, it's a pretty--"
00:56:29,00:56:34,"Maybe Morgan Freeman is-- you know, when Bowie became Ziggy Stardust, sort of exclusively"
00:56:34,00:56:39,"in real life for a period, maybe Morgan Freeman is his Ziggy, but he just hasn't broken out"
00:56:39,00:56:40,of character yet.
00:56:40,00:56:42,He's just become too immersed.
00:56:42,00:56:47,"Hey, here's a cool thing that connects Jimmy to the world of British comedy."
00:56:47,00:56:53,"The cover of Axis Baldur's Love, you might remember it, it's a very-- it has Hindu gods"
00:56:53,00:56:55,in the background and very colorful.
00:56:55,00:57:00,"That was designed by Roger Law, who created Spitting Image and all the white Spitting"
00:57:00,00:57:01,Image.
00:57:01,00:57:02,Yeah.
00:57:02,00:57:03,That's great.
00:57:03,00:57:04,"Oh my God, that's so good."
00:57:04,00:57:07,Are you guys familiar with Cynthia Plastercaster?
00:57:07,00:57:08,"Oh, yes."
00:57:08,00:57:09,No.
00:57:09,00:57:10,How familiar?
00:57:10,00:57:15,Can you explain what he did?
00:57:15,00:57:26,"Well, I believe Cynthia Plastercaster used to make Plastercasts of the genitals of famous"
00:57:26,00:57:28,people in the '60s.
00:57:28,00:57:32,"That is correct, except the thing is, everyone always says that, when you look up the list"
00:57:32,00:57:36,"of people she made them for, I think most famous people said, ""I'd rather you didn't"
00:57:36,00:57:38,"make a Plastercast of my penis."""
00:57:38,00:57:39,"Oh, OK."
00:57:39,00:57:40,One of the only people who did say--
00:57:40,00:57:43,There's no easy way of avoiding someone making a Plastercast of your penis.
00:57:43,00:57:45,"Well, yes, but Jimmy didn't."
00:57:45,00:57:46,He's got the whole Plastercast.
00:57:46,00:57:47,Isn't that an amazing thing to do?
00:57:47,00:57:48,Yeah.
00:57:48,00:57:54,"Just say to this random, weird lady kind of groupie, ""Yeah, I'll shove my erect penis"
00:57:54,00:57:55,"into your plaster."""
00:57:55,00:57:56,That's right.
00:57:56,00:57:57,No one wants flaccid Plastercast.
00:57:57,00:57:58,You're right.
00:57:58,00:57:59,You're right.
00:57:59,00:58:00,That's so funny.
00:58:00,00:58:03,"And there's no details on how it was made erect, whether it was a little bit like when"
00:58:03,00:58:04,you'd give a sperm donation.
00:58:04,00:58:07,I don't know if they send you and took room with a bunch of magazines.
00:58:07,00:58:12,There was a heavy inference that she was part of the-- there was no magazine in the waiting
00:58:12,00:58:13,room.
00:58:13,00:58:14,She was the magazine.
00:58:14,00:58:15,She was the magazine.
00:58:15,00:58:16,Exactly.
00:58:16,00:58:17,She was the-- yes.
00:58:17,00:58:19,Where is this Plastercast now?
00:58:19,00:58:21,"It's in the Iceland phallological museum, actually."
00:58:21,00:58:22,Get out.
00:58:22,00:58:23,Is it really?
00:58:23,00:58:24,Yeah.
00:58:24,00:58:25,"Yeah, I think so."
00:58:25,00:58:26,Wow.
00:58:26,00:58:27,Have you seen a niche?
00:58:27,00:58:28,I have not.
00:58:28,00:58:29,Have you been over?
00:58:29,00:58:30,"Not other than a fan, then."
00:58:30,00:58:38,My Hendricks fandom has not extended to going to visit the Plastercast of his penis.
00:58:38,00:58:42,"Listen, if I'm in the area, of course I'm taking a look at it."
00:58:42,00:58:50,"Have I seen it on Google Images yet, but that's not-- let's move on."
00:58:50,00:58:52,Move on.
00:58:52,00:58:54,Is it my phone wallpaper?
00:58:54,00:58:55,Yes.
00:58:55,00:58:56,Move on.
00:58:56,00:58:59,"All right, look, we need to wrap up."
00:58:59,00:59:01,"Nish, you're going to be in Edinburgh, right?"
00:59:01,00:59:02,Yes.
00:59:02,00:59:06,"I'm going to be at the Edinburgh Fringe Festival, and I am very excited about it, and this is"
00:59:06,00:59:12,not me stalling for time whilst I Google what time my show is.
00:59:12,00:59:19,"My show, which I know the time and location of, is at 10 past 5 in the afternoon at the"
00:59:19,00:59:22,Assembly Theatre in George Square.
00:59:22,00:59:23,Do come along.
00:59:23,00:59:24,I will be there.
00:59:24,00:59:28,"I cannot deliver performance dynamics on a level of Jimi Hendricks, but what I can promise"
00:59:28,00:59:30,is I will be there on time.
00:59:30,00:59:34,What a sound.
00:59:34,00:59:38,"Okay, that's it."
00:59:38,00:59:40,That is all of our guest facts.
00:59:40,00:59:43,"Come back again next week, because we've got another show with four more comedians who"
00:59:43,00:59:46,are all going to be going up to the Edinburgh Fringe this year.
00:59:46,00:59:47,So we'll see you then.
00:59:47,00:59:48,Goodbye.
