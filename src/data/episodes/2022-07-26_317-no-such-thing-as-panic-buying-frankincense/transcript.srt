00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:13,940
 *starts playing*

00:00:13,940 --> 00:00:19,040
 Hello, and welcome to another Working From Home episode of No Such Thing as a Fish,

3
00:00:19,040 --> 00:00:24,180
 a weekly podcast not coming to you from the QI offices in Covent Garden.

4
00:00:24,180 --> 00:00:28,920
 My name is Dan Schreiber, I am sitting here with Anichezinski, Andrew Hunter Murray, and

5
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:33,480
 James Harkin, and once again, we have gathered around the microphones with our four favorite

6
00:00:33,480 --> 00:00:39,000
 facts from the last seven days, and in no particular order, here we go.

7
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:40,800
 Starting with you, Anna.

8
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:46,520
 My fact this week is that when people accidentally swallow coins, they're stomachs, sometimes

9
00:00:46,520 --> 00:00:47,840
 punch holes in them.

10
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:51,080
 I think this is so cool, and it's quite a new thing.

11
00:00:51,080 --> 00:00:54,080
 I'm not suggesting you should swallow a coin to test it out, but-

12
00:00:54,080 --> 00:00:57,240
 Anna, when you say it's quite a new thing, do you mean in the past when people swallow

13
00:00:57,240 --> 00:00:59,040
 coins, it's not done that?

14
00:00:59,040 --> 00:01:00,040
 Yes.

15
00:01:00,040 --> 00:01:01,040
 Wow.

16
00:01:01,040 --> 00:01:04,680
 So you didn't mean that coins are a relatively recent human invention, and we didn't have

17
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:07,720
 the capacity to swallow them until 8000 years ago, right?

18
00:01:07,720 --> 00:01:08,720
 I didn't mean that.

19
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:11,080
 No, people have been swallowing coins since time immemorial.

20
00:01:11,080 --> 00:01:14,000
 It's just that our stomachs have evolved is what you're saying.

21
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,720
 Exactly, in the last 20 years our stomachs have completely changed.

22
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:22,240
 No, that's not what's happened to either, coins have changed though, so this was a problem

23
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:27,200
 that was discovered in America in the 90s, and it turned out that copper coins had

24
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:32,140
 been swapped for copper-covered zinc coins, and if you swallow copper, then your stomach

25
00:01:32,140 --> 00:01:35,680
 acid doesn't really affect it, it can just go through, come out the other end, but if you

26
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:41,040
 got zinc in there, the stomach acid finds it much easier to chip away at it, and so doctors

27
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:43,240
 were finding in the 90s, they were x-raying kids.

28
00:01:43,240 --> 00:01:46,560
 They said they had stomach problems, for instance, and they saw these kind of discs with

29
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:50,120
 lots of holes in them, like really neat holes punched in them, and they didn't really know

30
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:54,400
 what they were, and turned out they were coins, but made of zinc, and they had the holes

31
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:57,440
 punched, and so how cool is that?

32
00:01:57,440 --> 00:01:58,440
 Yeah, it's amazing.

33
00:01:58,440 --> 00:02:00,080
 How come it doesn't dissolve the entire coin?

34
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:02,260
 Why is it so neatly just punching holes in it?

35
00:02:02,260 --> 00:02:07,560
 Well, I would guess that the copper that the zinc coins are sometimes covered with can erode

36
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:10,920
 a bit with use, so I think sometimes bits of copper will have come off on parts of the

37
00:02:10,920 --> 00:02:14,560
 surface, and not on others, and if the acid can get through the copper, it can suddenly

38
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:18,720
 penetrate through the zinc, so it'll be on the bits of the coin where the copper hasn't

39
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:19,720
 been eroded.

40
00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:20,720
 That's clever.

41
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:21,720
 Super clever.

42
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:26,600
 Isn't there a country where coins have holes in them already?

43
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:27,600
 I'm sure…

44
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:28,600
 Yeah, loads of countries.

45
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:29,600
 Yeah.

46
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:30,600
 There's a square hole.

47
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:33,440
 I'm sure there's a country which has either a square or a round hole.

48
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:35,600
 It's probably one of the two in the middle of it.

49
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:36,600
 Yeah.

50
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:37,600
 I can't remember which country that is really annoying.

51
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:41,200
 Well, the way they manufacture those is they get someone at the Royal Mint to swallow

52
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:42,200
 every single coin.

53
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:44,440
 It's a very hard choice of process.

54
00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:47,200
 It's very hard to retrieve them at the end, though, isn't it?

55
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:52,160
 It's not all dogs like the worst fruit machine ever, the money comes out at the end, but

56
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:53,920
 you're not really excited by it.

57
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:54,920
 Yeah.

58
00:02:54,920 --> 00:02:59,200
 You are getting, though, a square hole out of a round hole at the end of it.

59
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:00,200
 Yeah.

60
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:01,200
 Oh, that's cool.

61
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:02,200
 Yeah.

62
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:03,200
 They do it in…

63
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:04,200
 Oh, sorry.

64
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:05,200
 Have you seen that?

65
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:09,040
 I think Wikipedia's Twitter feed tweeted it this weekend.

66
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:10,040
 Have you seen it?

67
00:03:10,040 --> 00:03:11,600
 It's like a Tyler in Japan.

68
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:12,920
 Is it in Japan?

69
00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:16,080
 Where it can recognise you by your anus.

70
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:17,080
 Yeah.

71
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:18,080
 Oh, yeah.

72
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:19,840
 Isn't it amazing?

73
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:21,120
 What an amazing bit of technology.

74
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:22,120
 You like James?

75
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:23,120
 You sit there.

76
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:26,760
 Well, I'm back.

77
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:32,840
 And it's just all the cameras can look at your anus and just say, "Oh, that's you, James."

78
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:33,840
 What possible need is that?

79
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:39,920
 If you hear next door in a public toilet, if you hear a toilet going, "Oh, no, no, no,

80
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:40,920
 you again."

81
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:45,040
 That's the next thing when they were consenting, isn't it?

82
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:47,000
 Is it useful for…

83
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,000
 What is it useful for?

84
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,520
 Is it so that if you've got lots of people in the house and you're trying to monitor your

85
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:53,520
 health, but you don't want to get confused between…

86
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:54,520
 I think it is like that.

87
00:03:54,520 --> 00:03:59,720
 It's like, you know, having a Fitbit on your wrist and it can tell, like, what's wrong

88
00:03:59,720 --> 00:04:00,720
 with you.

89
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:04,840
 But the thing is with the toilet, you can't really carry it around with you, so it needs

90
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:05,840
 to…

91
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:06,840
 And lots of people use it.

92
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:09,840
 So it kind of needs to know who's using it at any one time.

93
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:14,360
 So it can look at your VCs and decides what's wrong with you, maybe?

94
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:19,480
 Maybe for crimes they could use it as, you know, anal recognition, you know, we might be

95
00:04:19,480 --> 00:04:20,480
 able to bust criminals by…

96
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:28,920
 Well, it would save a lot of very embarrassing police line-ups, wouldn't it?

97
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:30,800
 They should call this thing a Fitbit.

98
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:31,800
 That's what they should call it.

99
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:32,800
 They've got to do that.

100
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:33,800
 They've got to do that.

101
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:37,640
 Anyway, so that's what we've got to say about coins, I guess.

102
00:04:37,640 --> 00:04:42,600
 Well, I just wanted to say, the fact that Sink reacts with your stomach acid is quite

103
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:44,200
 an interesting thing.

104
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:50,760
 So in 2015, they invented this new technology, it's like you kind of take a pill and the pill

105
00:04:50,760 --> 00:04:55,520
 has like a tiny motor in it and the motor is activated.

106
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:58,680
 It's made out of zinc and it's activated by your stomach acid.

107
00:04:58,680 --> 00:05:03,600
 So the zinc reacts with your stomach acid and generates like hydrogen bubbles and then

108
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:08,800
 those bubbles mean that it can act like a torpedo and it fires through your stomach so

109
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:13,400
 that it gets into your stomach wall and it can kind of lodge there and it can put stuff

110
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:14,400
 into your bloodstream.

111
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:15,400
 Oh wow.

112
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:16,400
 Isn't that amazing?

113
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:17,400
 Wow.

114
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:18,400
 Awesome.

115
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:22,560
 So it's a motor that's only activated when it reacts, when the Sink reacts with the…

116
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:23,560
 Exactly.

117
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:24,560
 Hydrogen, didn't you say?

118
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:28,560
 It's Sink reacting with hydrochloric acid creating hydrogen bubbles.

119
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:29,560
 That's so clever.

120
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:30,560
 Genius.

121
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:35,840
 And that, isn't that what the Alanis Morissette album Jagged Little Pill is about?

122
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:36,840
 That is.

123
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:41,200
 It's weird though because this technology was only invented in 2015 but that album came

124
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:43,360
 out in the '90s or something.

125
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:45,080
 He's got real foresight though.

126
00:05:45,080 --> 00:05:46,080
 Yeah.

127
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:47,080
 She accidentally didn't patent the invention.

128
00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:48,080
 She released it as lyrics.

129
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:49,080
 Oh, I'm sorry.

130
00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:50,080
 How ironic.

131
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:51,080
 How ironic.

132
00:05:51,080 --> 00:05:56,240
 Have you got any more on this, Anna?

133
00:05:56,240 --> 00:06:00,200
 Just quickly to share some advice, please be advised number one is just don't swallow

134
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:03,840
 coins just because you want to be able to thread them on a string or whatever.

135
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:06,680
 And when I say accidentally, I guess I'm talking about children.

136
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:08,040
 It's mostly them who swallow coins.

137
00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:11,080
 So maybe they're doing it on purpose but they don't know why.

138
00:06:11,080 --> 00:06:15,720
 But the current medical advice is to doctors, if you're looking at an x-ray and you see

139
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:20,520
 some coins in a stomach, is that if it's just a coin that's sort of intact, you can just

140
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:23,600
 leave it, send the patient home and it'll probably pass.

141
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:28,160
 But if it's a coin with scalloped edges or holes in it, then you should endoscopically

142
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:32,400
 remove it because that implies it's been there for a bit too long and it's decided to

143
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:33,400
 sort of bed down.

144
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:34,400
 Oh.

145
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:38,600
 That should be a medical advice out there from an amateur to the experts.

146
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:43,240
 An enthusiastic colour should though, Anna, the right, certainly.

147
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:45,640
 But stomach acid is amazing, isn't it?

148
00:06:45,640 --> 00:06:47,200
 The power of stomach acid.

149
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:50,120
 If you swallow razor blades, again, don't do it because they'll slit your throat on

150
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:53,960
 the way down, but if you do and survive it, your stomach acid can just break them right

151
00:06:53,960 --> 00:06:54,960
 down.

152
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:55,960
 Wow.

153
00:06:55,960 --> 00:06:56,960
 Incredible.

154
00:06:56,960 --> 00:06:57,960
 Is more acidic than battery acid.

155
00:06:57,960 --> 00:06:58,960
 That is amazing.

156
00:06:58,960 --> 00:06:59,960
 Wow.

157
00:06:59,960 --> 00:07:05,160
 So crocodiles, they can secrete stomach acid 10 times faster than any other animals, which

158
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:06,160
 is this amazing.

159
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:09,760
 I mean, when you think about that, that's nuts.

160
00:07:09,760 --> 00:07:13,680
 And it's because they do it because they have these massive meals every so often and they

161
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:15,400
 need to break them down.

162
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:20,280
 And they have, instead of, you know, we've got an aorta blood vessel in our bodies.

163
00:07:20,280 --> 00:07:25,000
 They've got two, one of which supplies the heart, but one of which is a special one which

164
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,400
 goes to the stomach.

165
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:31,560
 And when they eat, the brain, the crocodile's brain signals the heart and it says, don't

166
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:37,200
 send any blood to the lungs, just pump it all to the stomach via the special super highway.

167
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:40,760
 And then there's carbon, lots of carbon dioxide builds up in their blood because none of their

168
00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:42,160
 blood is going to the lungs.

169
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:44,920
 So the carbon dioxide is not getting out of their bloodstream.

170
00:07:44,920 --> 00:07:50,320
 But what that means is that the stomach takes that blood, which is full of carbon dioxide

171
00:07:50,320 --> 00:07:53,560
 and it pulls the carbon dioxide out to create more acid.

172
00:07:53,560 --> 00:07:55,200
 So that's how they make it.

173
00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:59,440
 And they can digest gazelle horns and hooves and they just eat anything and it can just

174
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:00,440
 be broken down.

175
00:08:00,440 --> 00:08:02,000
 It's because they've got this magic method of making it.

176
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,000
 That's incredible.

177
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,000
 That's so cool.

178
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:07,560
 So it's like dual purpose because the vessel is, first of all, going to the stomach to help

179
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:11,640
 it out, but also the increased carbon content of the blood can then be used.

180
00:08:11,640 --> 00:08:12,640
 Yeah.

181
00:08:12,640 --> 00:08:13,640
 They're very clever on it.

182
00:08:13,640 --> 00:08:14,640
 That's amazing.

183
00:08:14,640 --> 00:08:19,760
 Do you know stomach acid is the reason that when you do a number two, it can sting, because

184
00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:22,480
 yeah, I thought that was really interesting.

185
00:08:22,480 --> 00:08:26,080
 So it doesn't, it doesn't eat away at your stomach lining because we've got a very

186
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:28,800
 protective layer of mucus in our stomach lining.

187
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:34,960
 But if you've got a particularly bad lump of turd, then and it comes out and it really

188
00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:41,240
 breathes because it's just so polite for number two, and then you're like, okay, now what's

189
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:42,920
 another polite sitting in for that?

190
00:08:42,920 --> 00:08:43,920
 I forgot all the words.

191
00:08:43,920 --> 00:08:45,680
 I forgot all the other words.

192
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:47,320
 A lump of turd.

193
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:48,680
 A fecal mouser.

194
00:08:48,680 --> 00:08:53,640
 Then there's a little bit of stomach acid still left on the outside of it and your rectum

195
00:08:53,640 --> 00:08:55,120
 isn't protected from it.

196
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:57,440
 Is that right?

197
00:08:57,440 --> 00:09:00,240
 That's not in all cases where it stings, so is it?

198
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:02,680
 If you have a curry, that might be due to the chilies or something.

199
00:09:02,680 --> 00:09:05,120
 I think that is also due to chilies, probably, yeah.

200
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:08,560
 So that's a potent combination of stomach acid and the chili, I guess.

201
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:09,560
 Gosh.

202
00:09:09,560 --> 00:09:12,200
 That would be a painful stool.

203
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:13,200
 Yeah.

204
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:19,480
 So there's the word you should have used at a stool, that's a classy, classy way of telling

205
00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:20,480
 it.

206
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:26,320
 Well, penguins, king penguins specifically, they are like the reverse of crocodiles.

207
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:31,280
 It was a crocodile thing, I said just now.

208
00:09:31,280 --> 00:09:36,480
 So king penguins can basically turn themselves into a fridge, their own stomach on the inside.

209
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:41,600
 They can turn it into a larder because they sometimes have to provide an emergency meal

210
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:47,960
 for their chicks, and they, as a result, don't want to digest any of their food.

211
00:09:47,960 --> 00:09:53,520
 And so they stop producing stomach acid, basically, and that means that the food just, and then

212
00:09:53,520 --> 00:09:58,280
 they just have these fish in their guts for up to three weeks on end, which they can then

213
00:09:58,280 --> 00:10:01,680
 regurgitate undigested, that's how they do it.

214
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:02,680
 Isn't that mental?

215
00:10:02,680 --> 00:10:03,680
 Wow.

216
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:04,680
 Amazing.

217
00:10:04,680 --> 00:10:05,680
 Wow.

218
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:07,560
 And do they, do they keep it at sort of refrigerate a temperature, do we know?

219
00:10:07,560 --> 00:10:09,560
 Because otherwise, we're going to be quiet.

220
00:10:09,560 --> 00:10:10,560
 Quite rotten.

221
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:15,680
 I think if you're a penguin, everything, everything's a refrigerated cell, you're right.

222
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:16,680
 You're right.

223
00:10:16,680 --> 00:10:21,640
 And they do, Anna, they do kind of have antibacterial chemicals, which they can secrete inside themselves

224
00:10:21,640 --> 00:10:22,960
 to preserve the food.

225
00:10:22,960 --> 00:10:24,560
 So that's how they stop it rotting.

226
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:25,560
 Wow.

227
00:10:25,560 --> 00:10:26,560
 Yeah.

228
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:29,760
 So if you're fridge, you know, you lose power in your fridge, but you've got a penguin

229
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:30,760
 lying around.

230
00:10:30,760 --> 00:10:32,760
 You can store your thing in there.

231
00:10:32,760 --> 00:10:33,760
 Yeah.

232
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:34,760
 Great.

233
00:10:34,760 --> 00:10:40,240
 Um, my favorite stupid swallower, I think, is Chris Foster.

234
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:45,760
 Chris Foster from Bournemouth University, who in 2008 was out on a night out with his

235
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:51,120
 friends, who decided that he was too drunk, so tried to take him home to his room and to stop

236
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:52,120
 them from doing this.

237
00:10:52,120 --> 00:10:57,240
 He swallowed his room key and he had no memory of this, but woke up the next morning and

238
00:10:57,240 --> 00:11:00,080
 his friends were all like, mate, you swallowed your room key last night.

239
00:11:00,080 --> 00:11:01,080
 What you can do about it.

240
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:04,120
 And apparently, I like the detail that apparently one of his friends tried the Heimlich maneuver

241
00:11:04,120 --> 00:11:05,120
 on him.

242
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:09,760
 Because you can really imagine the drunken 12 people that someone Heimlich him, just sort

243
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:12,000
 of practically crushing him.

244
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:15,240
 So yeah, he went to your hospital and said, I think I swallowed my key last night.

245
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:21,680
 And indeed, he had, and he was sent home and passed the key 31 hours later and put it back

246
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:22,680
 on the fob.

247
00:11:22,680 --> 00:11:23,680
 Wow.

248
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:25,440
 A happy ending.

249
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:29,920
 And actually, it would have a slightly bigger hole in the key, so it would be easier to get

250
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:30,920
 it on his phone.

251
00:11:30,920 --> 00:11:31,920
 Absolutely.

252
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:32,920
 That's why he did it.

253
00:11:32,920 --> 00:11:35,160
 It's very clear thinking drunkenness.

254
00:11:35,160 --> 00:11:40,520
 My favorite swallower, sorry, we seem to be playing a game of my favorite swallower,

255
00:11:40,520 --> 00:11:43,720
 would probably be a guy from the 19th century.

256
00:11:43,720 --> 00:11:45,600
 Have you heard of the human ostrich?

257
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:46,600
 No.

258
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:48,920
 I haven't heard of the human ostrich.

259
00:11:48,920 --> 00:11:50,920
 This was a thing.

260
00:11:50,920 --> 00:11:53,400
 And in fact, it's not even just one person.

261
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:57,760
 There were loads of actors whose standard thing was the human ostrich, where their trick

262
00:11:57,760 --> 00:12:00,240
 was just swallowing cutlery or glass.

263
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:05,800
 And they were kind of an adjunct to the sword swallowing fraternity.

264
00:12:05,800 --> 00:12:06,800
 And that was just what they did.

265
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:11,040
 So there was a guy called Alfonso, who would eat glass and cork and cotton and wool.

266
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:14,880
 And it sounds more like sort of a swallowing apprentice's or interns.

267
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:18,680
 You know, you start off with a teaspoon, up to a dessert spoon.

268
00:12:18,680 --> 00:12:22,960
 That is how you learn to swallow a swallowing sort, though, not with a teaspoon, first.

269
00:12:22,960 --> 00:12:23,960
 Well.

270
00:12:23,960 --> 00:12:25,680
 That would be something a bit bigger than that.

271
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:30,640
 It's really, so I've been reading the files of the SSAI, which is the Swallow's Association

272
00:12:30,640 --> 00:12:35,720
 International, and they were surveyed about their work.

273
00:12:35,720 --> 00:12:39,480
 And there were 46 of them who got surveyed, because there are only 100 or 200 people

274
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:41,280
 in the world who do this for a living.

275
00:12:41,280 --> 00:12:48,120
 And the 46 people between them had swallowed 2,000 swords over the previous three months.

276
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:50,200
 Half of them had swallowed more than one sword.

277
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:56,400
 Five of them had swallowed 10 swords at a time, and one person had swallowed 16 swords simultaneously.

278
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:57,400
 Simultaneously.

279
00:12:57,400 --> 00:12:58,400
 Simultaneously.

280
00:12:58,400 --> 00:12:59,400
 Simultaneously, I know.

281
00:12:59,400 --> 00:13:00,400
 I know.

282
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:03,080
 And they all got asked about, you know, their tips and tricks.

283
00:13:03,080 --> 00:13:06,200
 And it was a study in the British Medical Journal that they were surveyed for.

284
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:12,640
 So it was trying to work out what injures them, and it turns out it's stubbed toes, actually.

285
00:13:12,640 --> 00:13:16,680
 I was just thinking, right, you don't see swords much these days, do you?

286
00:13:16,680 --> 00:13:21,240
 I mean, people don't use swords much for their original purpose.

287
00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:27,480
 So I just wondered, if you're a sword manufacturer, what percentage of them get swallowed, come

288
00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:28,480
 to you.

289
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:34,480
 Are you tempted as a sword manufacturer to just start rounding off the edges to make it

290
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:36,000
 slightly easier for these guys?

291
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,000
 Yeah.

292
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,000
 That's exactly what I'm thinking.

293
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,600
 If you're a sword manufacturer, you might as well go for where they're back then.

294
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:41,600
 Yeah.

295
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:42,600
 What?

296
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:43,600
 Make them taste nice, maybe.

297
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:44,600
 Yes.

298
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:45,600
 Like a flavoured condom.

299
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:46,600
 But with a sword.

300
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:47,600
 Well, they have a sheath.

301
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:48,600
 Don't they?

302
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:49,600
 So, they do.

303
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:51,600
 But the person is the sheath.

304
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:52,600
 Yes.

305
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:53,600
 That's interesting.

306
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:59,600
 The aim, they said, is to become a living scabbard for the sword.

307
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:00,600
 That's not right.

308
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:01,600
 Yeah.

309
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:05,440
 And because the aim, really, I mean, when you're swallowing a sword, the aim is not to swallow.

310
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:07,960
 Swallowing contracts all the muscles all the way down.

311
00:14:07,960 --> 00:14:09,760
 This is a disastrous thing to do.

312
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:10,960
 So, misnomer, isn't it, really?

313
00:14:10,960 --> 00:14:11,960
 It really is.

314
00:14:11,960 --> 00:14:12,960
 Yeah.

315
00:14:12,960 --> 00:14:14,960
 So, we should call them living scabbards, I think.

316
00:14:14,960 --> 00:14:19,000
 And that's actually what the wealthiest knights in Medieval times used to have, isn't it?

317
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:24,400
 One of their servants would be there at their hip.

318
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:29,880
 And it's the wealthier of the knight, you are, the more swords your living scabbard can accommodate.

319
00:14:29,880 --> 00:14:31,600
 So, it's like choosing a golfer.

320
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:32,600
 Yeah.

321
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:33,600
 Yeah.

322
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:38,440
 Anna, when you sent us this fact, you sent us a link to new scientist, I think, which

323
00:14:38,440 --> 00:14:42,000
 was your evidence for it.

324
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:45,680
 And so, I went on to new scientists to search for swallowing.

325
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:49,000
 And actually, I found some stuff about sword swallowing as well.

326
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:53,280
 So, there is a book that they talked about, which sounds amazing.

327
00:14:53,280 --> 00:14:54,640
 I'm definitely going to buy it.

328
00:14:54,640 --> 00:15:01,120
 It's called Memoirs of a Sword Swallower by Dan Mannix, and it was published in 1951.

329
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:02,920
 And it talks about all sorts of things.

330
00:15:02,920 --> 00:15:10,400
 But one of them is that people used to swallow giant corkscrews, so, I know, right, so this

331
00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:11,400
 is amazing.

332
00:15:11,400 --> 00:15:15,760
 The way that you do it is you put the corkscrew down into your throat, and you're kind of twisting

333
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:16,760
 it round.

334
00:15:16,760 --> 00:15:20,920
 And as you're doing it, you're making your pharynx, which is like the bit of your throat

335
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:21,920
 behind your mouth.

336
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:25,800
 You're making it kind of jump up and down with a muscle, and then you twist it, and then

337
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:28,800
 you make it jump again, and then you twist it, and then you make it jump again.

338
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:31,640
 And you can get the whole corkscrew down your throat.

339
00:15:31,640 --> 00:15:32,640
 Isn't that amazing?

340
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:34,640
 That's the step of art, isn't it?

341
00:15:34,640 --> 00:15:35,960
 The step of sword swallowing.

342
00:15:35,960 --> 00:15:42,000
 And, do you know what they could also swallow is a duck's penis, could you say?

343
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,000
 Yes, they could.

344
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,000
 What did they want it?

345
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:50,920
 What in the cabaret act that would be?

346
00:15:50,920 --> 00:15:53,440
 What an excuse when your life comes home.

347
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:57,200
 I'm a living scabbard.

348
00:15:57,200 --> 00:16:01,520
 Do you know what I think a lot of wives, if they came home and find their heart,

349
00:16:01,520 --> 00:16:05,080
 they had been doing that, and they said, "I'm going to start a career as a giant corkscrew

350
00:16:05,080 --> 00:16:06,080
 swallower."

351
00:16:06,080 --> 00:16:10,240
 They would wish that they'd just been forlating the duck.

352
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:14,840
 I'll be my position.

353
00:16:14,840 --> 00:16:21,440
 Okay, it is time for fact number two, and that is Andy.

354
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:26,600
 My fact is that soldiers in the Russian army weren't issued socks until 2007.

355
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:27,600
 Wow.

356
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:28,600
 Wow.

357
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:29,600
 Wow.

358
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:33,280
 Well, they didn't go around the world fighting barefoot, did they?

359
00:16:33,280 --> 00:16:35,880
 They didn't get... no, no, they're not hippies.

360
00:16:35,880 --> 00:16:39,880
 They're the opposite of hippies in the Russian army, they're very, very tough people.

361
00:16:39,880 --> 00:16:44,840
 But they didn't have the socks that we know and love today.

362
00:16:44,840 --> 00:16:48,720
 Was it a case of bringing your own socks kind of thing?

363
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:49,720
 No.

364
00:16:49,720 --> 00:16:54,560
 They were issued with footwear for between the shoe and the foot, but the thing that the

365
00:16:54,560 --> 00:17:00,240
 Russian army wore for centuries, actually, were these squares of cloth called Port Yankee.

366
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:02,160
 I hope I'm pronouncing that right.

367
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:07,800
 They had cotton ones for the summer and warmer, flannel ones for the winter, and they came

368
00:17:07,800 --> 00:17:13,280
 in a square and you had to do this little elaborate dance of wrapping them around your foot.

369
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:15,240
 But the thing is, they had lots of advantages.

370
00:17:15,240 --> 00:17:19,400
 So they were cheap to make, they were very easy to wash and dry and mend, and if you've

371
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:23,520
 got a hole in it, it didn't matter, because there were several layers to them, so one

372
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:26,840
 hole, you know, is not a problem.

373
00:17:26,840 --> 00:17:28,760
 So there were lots of advantages.

374
00:17:28,760 --> 00:17:29,760
 Yeah.

375
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:35,520
 So I asked my father-in-law, who was in the Russian army, actually, about these, and he said,

376
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:41,000
 yeah, they're pretty good, actually, because one thing is the boots they would give you were

377
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,200
 extremely un-flexible.

378
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:47,600
 So let's say they probably wouldn't fit exactly the shape of your foot.

379
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:52,200
 In fact, they almost certainly wouldn't, but what you could do with these wraps is you

380
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:56,680
 could kind of stuff a little bit here, stuff a little bit there, kind of do it on two layers

381
00:17:56,680 --> 00:18:01,080
 here and on one layer there, so it would make your foot fit exactly in the size of your

382
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:02,080
 boot.

383
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:06,440
 They could turn your foot into whatever size and shape you'd need it to be.

384
00:18:06,440 --> 00:18:07,440
 Yeah.

385
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:08,440
 Pretty much, yeah, exactly.

386
00:18:08,440 --> 00:18:13,240
 I watched a video online of someone wrapping their foot up with one of these, and the process

387
00:18:13,240 --> 00:18:14,240
 was very intricate.

388
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:17,480
 It was like swaddling a baby.

389
00:18:17,480 --> 00:18:21,280
 You have to really tuck it under bits and make sure it flips over this other bit.

390
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:24,720
 So they're wearing a bag over their foot, really, an elaborate bag over their foot, rather

391
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:25,720
 than a fitted sock?

392
00:18:25,720 --> 00:18:26,720
 Yeah.

393
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:29,160
 I mean, what is a sock, but a bag?

394
00:18:29,160 --> 00:18:30,160
 But a footbag?

395
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:31,160
 That's true.

396
00:18:31,160 --> 00:18:34,560
 A sock is more of a bag than these squares of cloth, actually.

397
00:18:34,560 --> 00:18:35,560
 In a sense.

398
00:18:35,560 --> 00:18:41,360
 I suppose because it's comfortably fitted to one's foot, it feels less baggy, but yeah.

399
00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:43,680
 But socks are really important, if you're in the army, right?

400
00:18:43,680 --> 00:18:44,760
 They're super important.

401
00:18:44,760 --> 00:18:45,760
 Yeah.

402
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:50,480
 So in the world where one, for instance, they needed socks for their troops.

403
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:56,080
 And so they got people to knit them, because in those days, the way you made socks was by

404
00:18:56,080 --> 00:18:57,080
 knitting them.

405
00:18:57,080 --> 00:19:00,360
 You didn't have the big manufacturing processes that you have today.

406
00:19:00,360 --> 00:19:05,160
 And the problem with people knitting socks is not everyone is particularly good at knitting.

407
00:19:05,160 --> 00:19:06,160
 Oh, God.

408
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:09,560
 I would pity the soldier who had to deal with one of my socks.

409
00:19:09,560 --> 00:19:12,600
 It would be hell, you'd go barefoot.

410
00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:19,040
 So for instance, there was one army, one person in the army who wrote a poem, and it said,

411
00:19:19,040 --> 00:19:22,080
 "Thank you, kind lady, your socks are some fit.

412
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:25,280
 I used one for a hammock, and one for a mitt."

413
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:26,280
 No.

414
00:19:26,280 --> 00:19:28,880
 Very good.

415
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:32,360
 I thought he was going to finish saying one for my shit.

416
00:19:32,360 --> 00:19:33,880
 I thought that was going to be there.

417
00:19:33,880 --> 00:19:36,160
 And that's why you're not the poet laureate.

418
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:37,160
 I know.

419
00:19:37,160 --> 00:19:41,720
 We should never have submitted that rhyme to you when they asked.

420
00:19:41,720 --> 00:19:44,920
 It's so hard to define sock when you start researching it, isn't it?

421
00:19:44,920 --> 00:19:48,520
 It's like, they've sort of existed forever, all they've only existed for a hundred

422
00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:50,280
 years depending on how you do it.

423
00:19:50,280 --> 00:19:53,800
 So, I love this sort of variety.

424
00:19:53,800 --> 00:19:57,400
 And I found that, as I was really trying to get to grips with the history of them, they've

425
00:19:57,400 --> 00:20:02,840
 climbed up and down the leg like nobody's business over the last two thousand years.

426
00:20:02,840 --> 00:20:03,840
 It's so weird.

427
00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:08,040
 So you've got like, I think the oldest sock is from about two thousand years ago.

428
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:12,280
 And it kind of looks like our socks today, except it has, it was for a sandal.

429
00:20:12,280 --> 00:20:16,600
 And so it's like those socks that have a different bit for each of the toes.

430
00:20:16,600 --> 00:20:20,080
 Like it has one bit for the big toe and then a separate bit for the rest of the foot.

431
00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:25,040
 But then they sort of climbed up the leg gradually so they'd get longer and men were wearing

432
00:20:25,040 --> 00:20:28,480
 breaches when it got to about 14th, 15th century.

433
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:32,240
 So their trousers as it were will get shorter and shorter.

434
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:39,160
 And then eventually it got to a time in the 1400s where socks had turned into tights that

435
00:20:39,160 --> 00:20:43,960
 basically revealed the arse and your tunic or your breaches have become a jacket.

436
00:20:43,960 --> 00:20:48,680
 And there were all these laws about who was allowed to show their bum and who wore it.

437
00:20:48,680 --> 00:20:52,080
 The sock was basically the full leg covering by that point.

438
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:55,400
 And then they sort of descended again and got lower and lower until we have what we have

439
00:20:55,400 --> 00:20:57,720
 today, which is the short sock and trousers.

440
00:20:57,720 --> 00:20:59,720
 So they're just up and down all the time.

441
00:20:59,720 --> 00:21:04,720
 Do you know what that, that sounds like the progress of the Korean war up and down the

442
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:05,720
 Korean peninsula?

443
00:21:05,720 --> 00:21:06,720
 Do you remember?

444
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:10,320
 Because originally the North had made its way almost to the complete South of Ireland.

445
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:13,920
 And then there was a huge troop surge and they got pushed back almost to China.

446
00:21:13,920 --> 00:21:15,200
 And then it stabilized around it.

447
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:16,680
 Is it the 38th parallel?

448
00:21:16,680 --> 00:21:17,680
 That's where they kind of came to the--

449
00:21:17,680 --> 00:21:18,680
 The 38th parallel?

450
00:21:18,680 --> 00:21:19,680
 Yeah.

451
00:21:19,680 --> 00:21:23,120
 So maybe our socks will eventually stop at that parallel on our leg, which I guess would

452
00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:24,120
 be the knee.

453
00:21:24,120 --> 00:21:30,520
 Yeah, that's the parallel I'm trying to draw, and it's a parallel I regret drawing increasingly.

454
00:21:30,520 --> 00:21:32,120
 People used to be killed by their socks.

455
00:21:32,120 --> 00:21:34,360
 In the 19th century they were a real hazard.

456
00:21:34,360 --> 00:21:36,120
 There were lots of warnings about them.

457
00:21:36,120 --> 00:21:39,360
 This was in the age when dyes were quite dangerous.

458
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:41,120
 They weren't dyes were deadly.

459
00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:44,480
 And people used to complain constantly that certain types of socks, particularly the brightly

460
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:48,320
 coloured ones, would leave them with these massive ulcers or swollen feet that they couldn't

461
00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:53,360
 get in and out of their boots and sort of pussy soles, and people would get infections

462
00:21:53,360 --> 00:21:55,160
 from them and die.

463
00:21:55,160 --> 00:21:59,520
 And it got to the stage where in about the 1850s men were recommended to only wear white

464
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:03,440
 socks because if you had socks that had been dyed by certain types of dye, like a lot

465
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:08,800
 of them contained arsenic, which was an ideal, then you were risking your very life.

466
00:22:08,800 --> 00:22:09,800
 Wow.

467
00:22:09,800 --> 00:22:10,800
 In fact, the telegraphs--

468
00:22:10,800 --> 00:22:15,000
 The socks get dyed and then you get dyed.

469
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:21,600
 Again, another reason why you're not poor at loriate, we're just coming up with a lot, aren't we?

470
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:23,680
 But did they didn't actually kill anyone, did they?

471
00:22:23,680 --> 00:22:26,840
 And I don't think there were any recorded deaths where the cause of death was put on the

472
00:22:26,840 --> 00:22:27,840
 former's socks.

473
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:32,160
 I didn't find the death certificates, but there were certainly journalists who said that

474
00:22:32,160 --> 00:22:33,640
 they'd been killing people.

475
00:22:33,640 --> 00:22:37,480
 And you can imagine with infections, people weren't very good at staving off, you know.

476
00:22:37,480 --> 00:22:38,480
 I guess, yeah.

477
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:39,480
 Not in the body.

478
00:22:39,480 --> 00:22:43,920
 And socks advertise themselves for decades afterwards as special, wow, new, non-poisonous

479
00:22:43,920 --> 00:22:44,920
 socks.

480
00:22:44,920 --> 00:22:45,920
 They won't kill you.

481
00:22:45,920 --> 00:22:46,920
 That was the thing.

482
00:22:46,920 --> 00:22:47,920
 Did they?

483
00:22:47,920 --> 00:22:48,920
 Yeah, there are.

484
00:22:48,920 --> 00:22:49,920
 Victorian ads.

485
00:22:49,920 --> 00:22:57,720
 In 2015, someone invented a pair of socks, which were powered by urine.

486
00:22:57,720 --> 00:22:58,720
 Right.

487
00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:00,320
 First question.

488
00:23:00,320 --> 00:23:02,280
 Why do you need to power your socks?

489
00:23:02,280 --> 00:23:05,360
 Can you not get around without powering them?

490
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:06,360
 Good.

491
00:23:06,360 --> 00:23:07,360
 Great question.

492
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:08,360
 Thank you.

493
00:23:08,360 --> 00:23:09,880
 No, no, it's not the only question.

494
00:23:09,880 --> 00:23:10,880
 Yeah.

495
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:14,960
 There's another quite important question coming up about the urine powder.

496
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:15,960
 Yeah.

497
00:23:15,960 --> 00:23:16,960
 Yeah.

498
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:21,400
 So, what these are kind of designed for is if you are, let's say you're going for a hike

499
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:29,240
 or you're out and you get lost or you get into distress and you need to send a signal

500
00:23:29,240 --> 00:23:30,240
 to some people.

501
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:35,160
 But you've forgotten your phone and your, you know, pager or whatever else you were going

502
00:23:35,160 --> 00:23:36,160
 to use to someone.

503
00:23:36,160 --> 00:23:39,880
 Basically, you're only wearing a pair of socks, you're lost ever though.

504
00:23:39,880 --> 00:23:40,880
 That's right.

505
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:41,880
 Yeah.

506
00:23:41,880 --> 00:23:42,880
 All your other clothes have gone.

507
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:43,880
 Yeah.

508
00:23:43,880 --> 00:23:44,880
 You've woken up from a nightmare.

509
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:45,880
 You shot him like yourself.

510
00:23:45,880 --> 00:23:47,400
 So, what do you do?

511
00:23:47,400 --> 00:23:48,400
 You're naked.

512
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:49,400
 You're lost.

513
00:23:49,400 --> 00:23:51,280
 All you have is a pair of socks.

514
00:23:51,280 --> 00:23:57,560
 You just put all you have to do is piss yourself and these, when filled with urine and activated

515
00:23:57,560 --> 00:24:03,520
 by your footsteps, they can send a little message to any prospective rescuers because they've

516
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:08,720
 got these tiny fuel cells which are turned on by fresh urine and the movement of your feet.

517
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:10,440
 Why do they have to do that?

518
00:24:10,440 --> 00:24:12,440
 Why do they have to include the footstep bit?

519
00:24:12,440 --> 00:24:16,800
 Surely you could just like, I don't know, spin them around or something.

520
00:24:16,800 --> 00:24:21,920
 Why do you have to put your pissy socks back on?

521
00:24:21,920 --> 00:24:24,080
 I don't think you need to take them off in the first place.

522
00:24:24,080 --> 00:24:25,880
 You just need to piss off.

523
00:24:25,880 --> 00:24:27,080
 Carefully weed down your legs.

524
00:24:27,080 --> 00:24:28,080
 Just piss on your feet.

525
00:24:28,080 --> 00:24:29,080
 Yeah.

526
00:24:29,080 --> 00:24:30,080
 Okay.

527
00:24:30,080 --> 00:24:34,960
 I think that would be very difficult, especially as a woman, to actually manage to weed into

528
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:36,840
 a sock whilst wearing it.

529
00:24:36,840 --> 00:24:41,200
 Actually, for a man, most of the challenges not pissing on your feet.

530
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:42,200
 Yeah.

531
00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:44,480
 And who's this, who's this notifying Andy?

532
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:48,280
 Is this like some unit of spin centre by the authorities?

533
00:24:48,280 --> 00:24:49,280
 Okay.

534
00:24:49,280 --> 00:24:50,280
 Yeah.

535
00:24:50,280 --> 00:24:54,840
 Like, you know, you know, Prince William, when he worked for Mountain Rescue, he used to

536
00:24:54,840 --> 00:25:00,520
 talk about getting the urine sock alarm every few days, didn't he?

537
00:25:00,520 --> 00:25:01,520
 Yeah.

538
00:25:01,520 --> 00:25:05,440
 So it means that it just proves that you're still alive and that you're worth rescuing.

539
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:06,440
 Ah.

540
00:25:06,440 --> 00:25:07,440
 Ah, you at that stage?

541
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:08,440
 I did not.

542
00:25:08,440 --> 00:25:09,440
 I didn't know.

543
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:10,440
 I didn't know.

544
00:25:10,440 --> 00:25:11,440
 Are you really worth rescuing?

545
00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:17,480
 I think I'm probably rather not be rescued at that point.

546
00:25:17,480 --> 00:25:21,280
 I was just thinking when you said they had adverts for socks that don't kill you.

547
00:25:21,280 --> 00:25:23,640
 You don't see many adverts for socks these days, do you?

548
00:25:23,640 --> 00:25:24,640
 No, that's true.

549
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:27,080
 Can you just assume you're just going to buy that, by guess?

550
00:25:27,080 --> 00:25:28,080
 Yeah.

551
00:25:28,080 --> 00:25:29,080
 Yeah.

552
00:25:29,080 --> 00:25:30,080
 Yeah.

553
00:25:30,080 --> 00:25:31,080
 It's usually when they do stunts, isn't it?

554
00:25:31,080 --> 00:25:32,080
 Stunt advertising.

555
00:25:32,080 --> 00:25:38,000
 So Ted Baker did an advert a few years ago, which was they started selling socks in odd pairs.

556
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:41,120
 So they would sell you instead of just two socks, prepare it.

557
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:45,800
 They would sell you three because there was a report of how we lose an odd sock.

558
00:25:45,800 --> 00:25:46,920
 We always have an odd sock.

559
00:25:46,920 --> 00:25:51,120
 So why not give you an extra sock so that you've always got a pair on the go, yeah?

560
00:25:51,120 --> 00:25:52,120
 That's quite clever.

561
00:25:52,120 --> 00:25:55,560
 I find that very annoying and discomforting, actually.

562
00:25:55,560 --> 00:25:57,040
 Yeah, me too, actually.

563
00:25:57,040 --> 00:25:58,040
 That was very stunty.

564
00:25:58,040 --> 00:25:59,040
 Yeah.

565
00:25:59,040 --> 00:26:00,040
 They had a sock amnesty.

566
00:26:00,040 --> 00:26:04,000
 You were meant to bring in that one odd sock if you were able to buy the pack of three.

567
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:08,040
 Basically, what happens is, as soon as you buy these three socks, you immediately have

568
00:26:08,040 --> 00:26:09,040
 an odd sock.

569
00:26:09,040 --> 00:26:10,040
 Yes.

570
00:26:10,040 --> 00:26:14,880
 So if you buy two, if you buy two of them, then you don't, then you have three pairs of socks.

571
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:15,880
 Right.

572
00:26:15,880 --> 00:26:18,280
 But then you can buy three pairs of socks, aren't you?

573
00:26:18,280 --> 00:26:19,280
 Yeah.

574
00:26:19,280 --> 00:26:26,320
 No, but there is a thing about sorting your socks, which is how amazingly difficult it

575
00:26:26,320 --> 00:26:31,680
 gets as soon as you have any reasonable number of interesting socks.

576
00:26:31,680 --> 00:26:36,440
 So if you have, so, and there are two problems with sock matching, which is if you have more

577
00:26:36,440 --> 00:26:45,800
 than one pair, which I do, sorry, bragg, hashtag bragg, one of them is full of piss, though.

578
00:26:45,800 --> 00:26:49,120
 But if you have more than one pair, firstly, you need to pair more socks, obviously.

579
00:26:49,120 --> 00:26:53,320
 But secondly, there is a larger part of unmatched socks that you have to hunt through, right?

580
00:26:53,320 --> 00:26:58,600
 So if you have five pairs of socks, it actually takes 25 times longer to match than one pair

581
00:26:58,600 --> 00:26:59,600
 of socks.

582
00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:00,600
 Okay.

583
00:27:00,600 --> 00:27:01,600
 This is by an algorithm.

584
00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:07,520
 Allegedly, if you have 100 different pairs of socks, right, it would take 10,000 times

585
00:27:07,520 --> 00:27:12,680
 longer to sort them, then one pair of socks.

586
00:27:12,680 --> 00:27:15,560
 No, I don't believe that.

587
00:27:15,560 --> 00:27:19,800
 And that's worked out that you're obviously sort of pairing them down every time you find a pair.

588
00:27:19,800 --> 00:27:22,680
 Yeah, I mean, I see the algorithms done its job.

589
00:27:22,680 --> 00:27:23,680
 I think so.

590
00:27:23,680 --> 00:27:24,680
 But they haven't done trials.

591
00:27:24,680 --> 00:27:25,680
 The end it gets easier.

592
00:27:25,680 --> 00:27:26,680
 Yeah.

593
00:27:26,680 --> 00:27:27,680
 Yeah, absolutely.

594
00:27:27,680 --> 00:27:30,320
 But the answer, obviously, is to only buy one kind of socks and just buy a hundred of those.

595
00:27:30,320 --> 00:27:31,320
 Yeah.

596
00:27:31,320 --> 00:27:32,920
 Hey, Andy, I've got one more question about your piss socks.

597
00:27:32,920 --> 00:27:33,920
 Oh my gosh.

598
00:27:33,920 --> 00:27:34,920
 God.

599
00:27:34,920 --> 00:27:42,080
 James raised a point there before, which is sometimes it's difficult for guys to aim properly

600
00:27:42,080 --> 00:27:43,080
 and that could land.

601
00:27:43,080 --> 00:27:50,560
 But has there been any cases where the authorities have busted into someone's house because they

602
00:27:50,560 --> 00:27:53,920
 pissed on their socks all the time?

603
00:27:53,920 --> 00:27:56,760
 Yeah, I think that's that.

604
00:27:56,760 --> 00:27:59,200
 Not as far as I know, but what a great question.

605
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:05,120
 It sounds like you haven't really done the research here, Andy.

606
00:28:05,120 --> 00:28:07,560
 I'm just talking about the fact that there's no sock advertising.

607
00:28:07,560 --> 00:28:10,200
 I really like fun socks.

608
00:28:10,200 --> 00:28:13,000
 And so I'm quite surprised that people don't, you know, companies don't make a bigger

609
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:14,000
 deal out of them.

610
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:19,880
 And I especially feel sorry for men when they have to wear suits or like quite bland matching

611
00:28:19,880 --> 00:28:20,880
 outfits.

612
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:25,800
 I know you're all wearing like cartoon themed tops today, but we're working from home.

613
00:28:25,800 --> 00:28:29,320
 But that's the only way that you can really express yourself, right?

614
00:28:29,320 --> 00:28:31,360
 It's by wearing stupid socks.

615
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:35,360
 So I was looking at some stupid socks and I hadn't realized something that I think a lot

616
00:28:35,360 --> 00:28:41,320
 of Canadians are aware of, which is that true dough engages in sock diplomacy a lot.

617
00:28:41,320 --> 00:28:45,760
 And so every sort of diplomatic event he goes to, he's wearing a different and appropriate

618
00:28:45,760 --> 00:28:47,280
 pair of socks.

619
00:28:47,280 --> 00:28:51,440
 And it was particularly apparent when he marched in Toronto's gay pride parade, wearing

620
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:56,520
 a rainbow striped pair, but printed with the words eedmubarak because it was also eed

621
00:28:56,520 --> 00:28:59,160
 the end of Ramadan at the time.

622
00:28:59,160 --> 00:29:00,160
 Wow.

623
00:29:00,160 --> 00:29:02,720
 And they were made by a Toronto based company.

624
00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:05,960
 Unfortunately, unfortunately nobody noticed any of that because he was also blacked up

625
00:29:05,960 --> 00:29:10,960
 at the time.

626
00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:16,080
 And I have one fact about which could have gone into this fact all the previous one, okay?

627
00:29:16,080 --> 00:29:17,080
 Okay.

628
00:29:17,080 --> 00:29:22,520
 So in 2014, there was a great day in an Oregon which was found to be in some distress and

629
00:29:22,520 --> 00:29:24,440
 his owners took him to the vet.

630
00:29:24,440 --> 00:29:27,640
 And if you combine this fact with the previous one, you know what I'm about to say, but they

631
00:29:27,640 --> 00:29:30,200
 found he'd been swallowing socks.

632
00:29:30,200 --> 00:29:31,200
 And they've-

633
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:35,000
 It's all really just now about guessing the number of pairs of socks that he's wearing

634
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:36,000
 from our perspective.

635
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:40,720
 How long do you think it would have taken to match the socks of that kind of reason?

636
00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:46,760
 I reckon the maximum number of socks that a great day can eat for your notice and take

637
00:29:46,760 --> 00:29:49,000
 them to the vet is 16.

638
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:50,000
 Okay.

639
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:51,000
 Okay.

640
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:52,000
 Pairs or individuals?

641
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:53,000
 Individuals.

642
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:55,000
 Because I guess they wouldn't necessarily swallow them in pairs.

643
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:56,000
 Go on.

644
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:57,000
 Any other guesses?

645
00:29:57,000 --> 00:30:00,200
 I'm going to say one sock, yes.

646
00:30:00,200 --> 00:30:01,200
 Wow.

647
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:02,200
 Okay.

648
00:30:02,200 --> 00:30:03,200
 Great Danes are.

649
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:04,200
 They're great.

650
00:30:04,200 --> 00:30:05,200
 So they can fit probably quite a lot.

651
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:06,200
 I think 30 socks.

652
00:30:06,200 --> 00:30:11,440
 I'm going to say, Dan, my ex had a dog who once had a sock and we had to get the sock out

653
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:15,360
 of it, which was an interesting day for us.

654
00:30:15,360 --> 00:30:20,560
 But I'm not sure that the international press would have been particularly interested in

655
00:30:20,560 --> 00:30:23,080
 jumping to one sock.

656
00:30:23,080 --> 00:30:26,440
 Or you missed an opportunity in reporting your story, James.

657
00:30:26,440 --> 00:30:27,440
 Yeah.

658
00:30:27,440 --> 00:30:31,560
 No, that's very good tactical thinking from James.

659
00:30:31,560 --> 00:30:33,760
 So thank you, Dan, for just getting one sock.

660
00:30:33,760 --> 00:30:38,000
 Because normally I was assuming you would do your usual thing and guess if you can 5,000

661
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:39,000
 socks.

662
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:40,000
 Exactly.

663
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:43,000
 I was going to say 100,000.

664
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:46,680
 This dog had eaten 43 and a half socks.

665
00:30:46,680 --> 00:30:47,680
 Wow.

666
00:30:47,680 --> 00:30:48,680
 Yeah.

667
00:30:48,680 --> 00:30:51,200
 And they had to do a sockectomy on it.

668
00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:57,040
 And in fact, this became news because it was published in the Trade magazine, Veterinary Practice

669
00:30:57,040 --> 00:30:58,040
 News.

670
00:30:58,040 --> 00:31:01,160
 And they had a competition for the animal which had eaten the most unusual thing.

671
00:31:01,160 --> 00:31:02,160
 And this great Dan won.

672
00:31:02,160 --> 00:31:03,160
 Great.

673
00:31:03,160 --> 00:31:08,520
 But there were some other runners-up in the competition which included a frog in Texas which

674
00:31:08,520 --> 00:31:14,120
 had eaten the rocks from its rockery and a dog in Florida which had eaten the kebab.

675
00:31:14,120 --> 00:31:17,480
 Now, that doesn't sound interesting, but it had also eaten the skewer.

676
00:31:17,480 --> 00:31:18,480
 Oh, God.

677
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:20,480
 That's going to hurt.

678
00:31:20,480 --> 00:31:27,840
 Okay, it is time for fact number three and that is my fact.

679
00:31:27,840 --> 00:31:33,760
 My fact this week is that in 2016 a man won the lottery for the second time using the exact

680
00:31:33,760 --> 00:31:36,920
 same numbers that won it for him the first time.

681
00:31:36,920 --> 00:31:39,600
 That man's name is Larry Gamble's.

682
00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:43,560
 And he hasn't changed his name since he did this.

683
00:31:43,560 --> 00:31:44,560
 No, no.

684
00:31:44,560 --> 00:31:45,560
 This was his name.

685
00:31:45,560 --> 00:31:50,600
 He also like bouncing around fields like a sheep.

686
00:31:50,600 --> 00:31:51,600
 He's not Larry Gamble's.

687
00:31:51,600 --> 00:31:52,600
 Oh, sorry.

688
00:31:52,600 --> 00:31:53,600
 That's a different guy.

689
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:54,600
 I think he is.

690
00:31:54,600 --> 00:32:01,080
 Larry Gamble's, he's from Madison, Illinois, which is a small place south of Chicago.

691
00:32:01,080 --> 00:32:07,040
 And he won a million dollars in 2016 as part of a lottery and the numbers that he used were

692
00:32:07,040 --> 00:32:12,440
 the same numbers that he used nine years ago when he won 50,000 in a different lottery.

693
00:32:12,440 --> 00:32:15,080
 So he worked twice for him.

694
00:32:15,080 --> 00:32:20,840
 And yeah, he obviously made the news because of his name because of his name, you know,

695
00:32:20,840 --> 00:32:24,520
 it's not like a great day in the sock.

696
00:32:24,520 --> 00:32:29,680
 He was asked if he had any advice on how to win the lottery, which is a great question

697
00:32:29,680 --> 00:32:32,920
 for journalists to ask.

698
00:32:32,920 --> 00:32:36,240
 And he said, "Pick your favourite numbers and stick with them.

699
00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:37,240
 It worked for me."

700
00:32:37,240 --> 00:32:38,240
 That is.

701
00:32:38,240 --> 00:32:39,240
 So there you go.

702
00:32:39,240 --> 00:32:40,240
 Guaranteed.

703
00:32:40,240 --> 00:32:41,240
 Sure, if I were winning.

704
00:32:41,240 --> 00:32:43,280
 I would argue that that's bad advice, though, right?

705
00:32:43,280 --> 00:32:48,760
 Because unless your favourite numbers are numbers that no one else likes, which is pretty

706
00:32:48,760 --> 00:32:52,640
 unlikely, statistically, you're more likely to like the number seven or the number three

707
00:32:52,640 --> 00:32:53,640
 or whatever.

708
00:32:53,640 --> 00:32:55,720
 You want to be choosing numbers that no one likes.

709
00:32:55,720 --> 00:32:56,920
 You want to be choosing horrible ones.

710
00:32:56,920 --> 00:32:57,920
 You're right.

711
00:32:57,920 --> 00:32:58,920
 Yeah, because then you get more.

712
00:32:58,920 --> 00:33:02,760
 Well, there was an article I was reading, which was saying that in each national lottery

713
00:33:02,760 --> 00:33:08,360
 draw, 10,000 people on average choose the numbers one, two, three, four, five and six.

714
00:33:08,360 --> 00:33:12,480
 And given the amount of most jackpots, which is about four million, that means even if

715
00:33:12,480 --> 00:33:13,960
 you win, you get four hundred quid.

716
00:33:13,960 --> 00:33:14,960
 Yeah.

717
00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:15,960
 Oh, wow.

718
00:33:15,960 --> 00:33:16,960
 Because it has a split between those people.

719
00:33:16,960 --> 00:33:17,960
 Mad.

720
00:33:17,960 --> 00:33:21,040
 I reckon that that serves you right for being so unimaginative.

721
00:33:21,040 --> 00:33:22,040
 Agreed.

722
00:33:22,040 --> 00:33:24,800
 I could not agree more.

723
00:33:24,800 --> 00:33:30,040
 Also, I know the number of combinations is so massive that, and I know that that is as

724
00:33:30,040 --> 00:33:32,280
 likely a combination of numbers as any other.

725
00:33:32,280 --> 00:33:33,280
 Is that correct?

726
00:33:33,280 --> 00:33:34,280
 Yeah.

727
00:33:34,280 --> 00:33:35,280
 Like getting those one, two, three.

728
00:33:35,280 --> 00:33:36,600
 However, I think we can all agree.

729
00:33:36,600 --> 00:33:37,600
 It's just not going to happen, is it?

730
00:33:37,600 --> 00:33:39,400
 It's never going to be one, two, three, four, five, six.

731
00:33:39,400 --> 00:33:40,400
 It's not.

732
00:33:40,400 --> 00:33:41,400
 You're right.

733
00:33:41,400 --> 00:33:42,400
 Of course not.

734
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:44,400
 Imagine the statistics be damned.

735
00:33:44,400 --> 00:33:45,400
 It will be a complete scandal.

736
00:33:45,400 --> 00:33:46,920
 It will be outrageous.

737
00:33:46,920 --> 00:33:51,040
 Actually, you know, you've got the first ever lottery ticket in the UK.

738
00:33:51,040 --> 00:33:53,280
 I think it was John Major.

739
00:33:53,280 --> 00:33:54,280
 Oh, yeah.

740
00:33:54,280 --> 00:33:55,280
 Prime Minister.

741
00:33:55,280 --> 00:33:58,720
 Did they not say that he was worried that he was going to win or something?

742
00:33:58,720 --> 00:33:59,720
 Yes.

743
00:33:59,720 --> 00:34:02,560
 He hoped he wouldn't win, because if he won, he would have to give the money back, and he

744
00:34:02,560 --> 00:34:07,440
 knew that his wife would be furious if he won and then he'd have to give back the money.

745
00:34:07,440 --> 00:34:10,200
 Imagine if the first ever national lottery, right?

746
00:34:10,200 --> 00:34:11,200
 It came up.

747
00:34:11,200 --> 00:34:13,720
 And I know if you guys remember it, you're probably too young.

748
00:34:13,720 --> 00:34:16,200
 I remember it because I was 16 and I could buy tickets.

749
00:34:16,200 --> 00:34:17,200
 It was really exciting.

750
00:34:17,200 --> 00:34:22,840
 But imagine if the first ball that came out was one, and then it was two, and it was three

751
00:34:22,840 --> 00:34:26,640
 and a four, then five and six, which is equally likely it could have happened.

752
00:34:26,640 --> 00:34:27,640
 Yeah.

753
00:34:27,640 --> 00:34:29,000
 I think that would have been just the end of it.

754
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:30,480
 No one would have trusted it ever again.

755
00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:31,480
 It would have been a scandal.

756
00:34:31,480 --> 00:34:32,480
 No one would ever buy a ticket again.

757
00:34:32,480 --> 00:34:38,200
 And then John Major's in the corner, because he is absolutely the sort of guy who would

758
00:34:38,200 --> 00:34:39,920
 have taken those numbers.

759
00:34:39,920 --> 00:34:40,920
 Yes.

760
00:34:40,920 --> 00:34:41,920
 It's just likely.

761
00:34:41,920 --> 00:34:44,720
 So any other combination?

762
00:34:44,720 --> 00:34:48,320
 I find this sticking with the same numbers thing really weird, because I found a headline in

763
00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:49,320
 the telegraph.

764
00:34:49,320 --> 00:34:50,560
 This just made me laugh so much.

765
00:34:50,560 --> 00:34:55,920
 It said, "Millionaire lottery winner dreamt numbers 28 years ago."

766
00:34:55,920 --> 00:35:05,280
 And this was a woman who, these numbers came to her in a dream in 1989, and then in 2017, they

767
00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:06,280
 came up.

768
00:35:06,280 --> 00:35:07,280
 Wow.

769
00:35:07,280 --> 00:35:12,920
 Did the dream tell her that it was 2017, or did she just not go round to it?

770
00:35:12,920 --> 00:35:14,680
 No, she'd been, she'd been placing the bets.

771
00:35:14,680 --> 00:35:16,600
 Every single week on that number.

772
00:35:16,600 --> 00:35:18,600
 So many ways.

773
00:35:18,600 --> 00:35:19,600
 Yeah.

774
00:35:19,600 --> 00:35:20,600
 What grandmother does that?

775
00:35:20,600 --> 00:35:21,600
 Okay.

776
00:35:21,600 --> 00:35:22,600
 My grandmother keeps the same numbers.

777
00:35:22,600 --> 00:35:28,000
 I think I do see the logic in keeping the same numbers once you've decided on them, because

778
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:32,360
 then if the numbers do come out, you feel like, "Ah, they were my numbers, and I should have

779
00:35:32,360 --> 00:35:34,640
 put them back on this week, and I didn't do it."

780
00:35:34,640 --> 00:35:35,640
 Yes.

781
00:35:35,640 --> 00:35:39,240
 And once you've started doing that, see the logic between behind not stopping.

782
00:35:39,240 --> 00:35:43,480
 My grandmother says that she didn't buy them one week, and that was the week when numbers

783
00:35:43,480 --> 00:35:44,480
 came up.

784
00:35:44,480 --> 00:35:50,040
 I just don't believe it at all, but she, that's a story in our family, she says it.

785
00:35:50,040 --> 00:35:53,360
 The other logical fallacy that people have is that they look at the numbers and they're

786
00:35:53,360 --> 00:35:54,360
 out by just one.

787
00:35:54,360 --> 00:36:00,280
 And you're like, "Ah, I had 45, and 46 came out, but apart from the fact that each ball is

788
00:36:00,280 --> 00:36:01,760
 not related, they're just numbers."

789
00:36:01,760 --> 00:36:02,760
 Yeah.

790
00:36:02,760 --> 00:36:06,800
 But of course, there are twice as many numbers that are won away from your number as your

791
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:07,800
 actual number.

792
00:36:07,800 --> 00:36:08,800
 Oh, yeah.

793
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:11,760
 So your twice is likely to be won away as the actual number.

794
00:36:11,760 --> 00:36:12,760
 That's a really good point.

795
00:36:12,760 --> 00:36:13,760
 I had thought about that.

796
00:36:13,760 --> 00:36:17,240
 Andy, you were saying about the person who came up with the number through a dream.

797
00:36:17,240 --> 00:36:19,840
 Did you hear about this guy in Spain in the 1970s?

798
00:36:19,840 --> 00:36:20,840
 No.

799
00:36:20,840 --> 00:36:21,840
 No.

800
00:36:21,840 --> 00:36:27,080
 So the way it works in Spain is you could go around the shop looking for specific numbers.

801
00:36:27,080 --> 00:36:30,880
 They printed out the numbers and you would choose whichever one you wanted.

802
00:36:30,880 --> 00:36:38,880
 This guy decided that he wanted a lottery ticket ending in 48, 48, so he went around all

803
00:36:38,880 --> 00:36:44,720
 the shops and eventually found a ticket and he bought it and he won the lottery and they interviewed

804
00:36:44,720 --> 00:36:49,080
 him afterwards like they always do and they said, "Oh, why, you know, what was your secret?"

805
00:36:49,080 --> 00:36:52,760
 And he said, "Oh, well, I was looking for this 48 and they said, "Oh, why are you looking

806
00:36:52,760 --> 00:36:53,760
 for the 48?"

807
00:36:53,760 --> 00:36:58,640
 And he said, "Well, I dreamt of the number seven for seven straight nights and seven times

808
00:36:58,640 --> 00:37:05,640
 seven is 48."

809
00:37:05,640 --> 00:37:06,640
 So good.

810
00:37:06,640 --> 00:37:07,640
 And it worked.

811
00:37:07,640 --> 00:37:08,640
 I love to win.

812
00:37:08,640 --> 00:37:11,400
 Have you guys heard of Stefan Mandel?

813
00:37:11,400 --> 00:37:14,560
 You may well have done researching people who won the lottery lots.

814
00:37:14,560 --> 00:37:22,200
 So he was a Romanian economist and he ended up winning the lottery 14 times because he worked

815
00:37:22,200 --> 00:37:29,280
 out that what he would do is he would form a syndicate and he grew up very, very poor

816
00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:30,280
 Romania.

817
00:37:30,280 --> 00:37:33,560
 He wanted to earn some real money and he would find a lottery and he would wait until

818
00:37:33,560 --> 00:37:38,520
 the jackpot for the lottery was bigger than all possible combinations of tickets.

819
00:37:38,520 --> 00:37:40,960
 So if you bought, you know, every single number.

820
00:37:40,960 --> 00:37:44,680
 So that only applies to certain lotteries obviously because if you did it for things like

821
00:37:44,680 --> 00:37:50,520
 the Euro-Million, it will be so expensive to buy tickets for every combination.

822
00:37:50,520 --> 00:37:56,400
 So he formed this syndicate and he what waited and then he would just buy every single ticket.

823
00:37:56,400 --> 00:37:59,120
 But the main tricky thing is the logistics of it.

824
00:37:59,120 --> 00:38:04,240
 So he had a team of people in Melbourne, he moved to Australia and he found a lottery in

825
00:38:04,240 --> 00:38:09,200
 Virginia in the USA which had enough money in the jackpot.

826
00:38:09,200 --> 00:38:12,080
 So you could print your own tickets at the time.

827
00:38:12,080 --> 00:38:15,520
 So he printed off one ton of tickets.

828
00:38:15,520 --> 00:38:19,760
 He had to ship them all the way to the USA from Australia.

829
00:38:19,760 --> 00:38:26,000
 He waited for the jackpot to be right and then on a certain week in 1992 the jackpot hit

830
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:30,040
 $15 million and he said this is the week we need to go for it.

831
00:38:30,040 --> 00:38:36,960
 But he had to form a team of people to take 1.4 million tickets to a shop and queue up, pay

832
00:38:36,960 --> 00:38:40,600
 for them, get them processed and they're registered as being properly bought.

833
00:38:40,600 --> 00:38:44,400
 And they had three days to do it, 1.4 million tickets.

834
00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:50,120
 He hired couriers who had tens of thousands of tickets each and almost all of them got

835
00:38:50,120 --> 00:38:55,680
 through but there was one batch of tickets, 140,000 which weren't registered.

836
00:38:55,680 --> 00:39:04,000
 There was one ticket which wasn't bought, it was one, two, three, four, five, six.

837
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:09,440
 And so when the time came there was so stressed obviously that the jackpot was in that one combination

838
00:39:09,440 --> 00:39:10,800
 of numbers they would have missed out.

839
00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:13,080
 Thankfully they got it and they won.

840
00:39:13,080 --> 00:39:16,920
 How much was it then that ended up being divided as in how much did each person get?

841
00:39:16,920 --> 00:39:20,440
 Did they get enough to make it worth that obscene and absurd apple?

842
00:39:20,440 --> 00:39:24,200
 I think a lot of people did not get enough to make it worth a hassle but I think he got

843
00:39:24,200 --> 00:39:29,080
 several million dollars and he moved to Vanuatu, the Pacific Island so yeah but everyone got

844
00:39:29,080 --> 00:39:30,840
 some money, everyone did win, you know.

845
00:39:30,840 --> 00:39:31,840
 Okay, worth it.

846
00:39:31,840 --> 00:39:36,680
 I was just thinking if you did buy all the tickets apart from one then basically your odds

847
00:39:36,680 --> 00:39:42,200
 of it being a complete disaster is the same as my odds of winning the lottery if I only buy

848
00:39:42,200 --> 00:39:43,480
 one ticket, isn't it?

849
00:39:43,480 --> 00:39:44,480
 Yeah.

850
00:39:44,480 --> 00:39:45,480
 That's true.

851
00:39:45,480 --> 00:39:47,480
 I am flukking at things.

852
00:39:47,480 --> 00:39:52,680
 It's always showing us the new angle.

853
00:39:52,680 --> 00:39:57,000
 That's the odds of losing the lottery in that case, isn't it?

854
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:58,000
 Yeah.

855
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:04,280
 I think about another guy in Melbourne actually, as you said that guy was who won and he sort

856
00:40:04,280 --> 00:40:09,240
 of often appears on articles about you know Lockest Man in the world and that's this guy

857
00:40:09,240 --> 00:40:15,240
 called Bill Morgan who was in the 90s, he had a bad accident actually and this ends happily

858
00:40:15,240 --> 00:40:18,320
 by the way that's why people say he's the Lockest Man in the world before you start getting

859
00:40:18,320 --> 00:40:19,320
 upset.

860
00:40:19,320 --> 00:40:24,640
 So he had an accident where he ended up dead for 14 minutes.

861
00:40:24,640 --> 00:40:25,640
 Oh right, sorry.

862
00:40:25,640 --> 00:40:33,240
 He genuinely, I thought that was a very short story.

863
00:40:33,240 --> 00:40:37,920
 He ended up dead for 14 minutes like clinically dead but they resuscitated him, he you know

864
00:40:37,920 --> 00:40:42,600
 and twice, he was in a coma for 12 days, they were advised to turn off his life support

865
00:40:42,600 --> 00:40:46,880
 twice because they were like he's going to be completely brain dead but he woke up completely

866
00:40:46,880 --> 00:40:49,680
 fine, turned up, didn't have any brain damage at all.

867
00:40:49,680 --> 00:40:55,200
 So he proposed to his girlfriend straight away, said yes and to celebrate a bit of a low

868
00:40:55,200 --> 00:41:00,560
 brown way of celebrating but he bought a scratch card and he scratched it off and he'd want

869
00:41:00,560 --> 00:41:06,880
 a car and so he was delighted about this and he, and the local news, very, very local news

870
00:41:06,880 --> 00:41:10,680
 I guess got in touch but I mean it was quite a big story because he'd been in this coma and

871
00:41:10,680 --> 00:41:13,080
 he'd suddenly come out and he'd won this car.

872
00:41:13,080 --> 00:41:14,080
 So the local news came.

873
00:41:14,080 --> 00:41:18,640
 Did the local news, the local news also accuse him of being low brown for celebrating coming

874
00:41:18,640 --> 00:41:22,960
 out of his coma?

875
00:41:22,960 --> 00:41:27,160
 I think what I meant was it was quite an underwhelming way to celebrate buying one scratch

876
00:41:27,160 --> 00:41:28,640
 card, you know?

877
00:41:28,640 --> 00:41:29,640
 Okay.

878
00:41:29,640 --> 00:41:34,680
 Look fine, it's a perfectly decent way to celebrate surviving a coma and getting engaged

879
00:41:34,680 --> 00:41:35,680
 buying a scratch card.

880
00:41:35,680 --> 00:41:39,080
 I know what you mean because it's like if you get engaged there's, it's sort of saying

881
00:41:39,080 --> 00:41:43,800
 I am happy to be with you rather than I wish for a dramatic change in my life circumstances.

882
00:41:43,800 --> 00:41:48,960
 So it's a slightly, there's a bit of side eye to it if you say let's, let's try and change

883
00:41:48,960 --> 00:41:49,960
 everything.

884
00:41:49,960 --> 00:41:51,800
 It's actually a bit of an insult, isn't it?

885
00:41:51,800 --> 00:41:55,520
 Right now I've doomed my life, let's try and find something that can possibly resuscitate

886
00:41:55,520 --> 00:41:56,520
 it.

887
00:41:56,520 --> 00:42:02,200
 Anyway, this film, local film crew came to film his delight and they asked him to reenact

888
00:42:02,200 --> 00:42:07,320
 the moment that he'd won the car and so they got him to buy another scratch card and

889
00:42:07,320 --> 00:42:08,320
 scratch it off to reenact.

890
00:42:08,320 --> 00:42:12,240
 Oh my god, I've won a car and then he looked down at the scratch card and he went, oh my

891
00:42:12,240 --> 00:42:18,720
 god, I've won $250,000 and they were like, well you got the line wrong mate and there's

892
00:42:18,720 --> 00:42:21,120
 other scratch card, one of 250 grand.

893
00:42:21,120 --> 00:42:22,120
 Wow.

894
00:42:22,120 --> 00:42:26,560
 And he immediately dumped his fiancee.

895
00:42:26,560 --> 00:42:32,320
 Okay, it's time for our final fact of the show and that is James.

896
00:42:32,320 --> 00:42:37,160
 Okay, in my fact this week is that Zagreb has a museum of hangovers.

897
00:42:37,160 --> 00:42:42,640
 His inventor was inspired when a friend woke up one morning with an unexplained bike pedal

898
00:42:42,640 --> 00:42:46,940
 in his pocket.

899
00:42:46,940 --> 00:42:53,960
 So this is a guy called a Reno W. Yockovich who was a university student in Zagreb in Croatia

900
00:42:53,960 --> 00:42:58,960
 and he said that he told journalists that a friend spoke about how he woke up with a bicycle

901
00:42:58,960 --> 00:43:04,680
 pedal in his pocket and I thought, as I listened to him, why not set up a place and museum with

902
00:43:04,680 --> 00:43:09,640
 a collection of these objects as stories that will illustrate in a funny way these evenings

903
00:43:09,640 --> 00:43:12,600
 of drunkenness and the hangover the next day.

904
00:43:12,600 --> 00:43:16,440
 I rather than just thinking it, he actually went and did it and this is the thing that now

905
00:43:16,440 --> 00:43:19,240
 exists in Croatia.

906
00:43:19,240 --> 00:43:21,640
 It's amazing that it's a real place, yeah.

907
00:43:21,640 --> 00:43:23,880
 Yeah, it sounds really cool, doesn't it?

908
00:43:23,880 --> 00:43:28,200
 The idea of visit when you go inside it, it recreates your drunken journey home so it's

909
00:43:28,200 --> 00:43:33,800
 room by room, you start in the bar and then you go on to sort of graffiti lined walls

910
00:43:33,800 --> 00:43:38,680
 that emulate a street and then you get to store fronts and then at a guard and finally your

911
00:43:38,680 --> 00:43:39,680
 bedroom.

912
00:43:39,680 --> 00:43:40,680
 That's the end of the museum.

913
00:43:40,680 --> 00:43:45,160
 Finally, you swallow your house key.

914
00:43:45,160 --> 00:43:50,120
 They have chalkboard in there where it features the beginning of a sentence which is, I woke

915
00:43:50,120 --> 00:43:54,800
 up with and then you can write in your answers of, you know, the worst thing you've woken

916
00:43:54,800 --> 00:43:59,540
 up with when you've had a hangover and answers in the museum at the moment or when this

917
00:43:59,540 --> 00:44:05,980
 answer was written include two stray dogs, a lot of pumpkins and I saw the girl who wrote

918
00:44:05,980 --> 00:44:11,980
 this, one eye, now this is very frustrating because I saw there's like a video footage

919
00:44:11,980 --> 00:44:16,060
 of inside the museum and you see this girl write one eye but you only see her in profile

920
00:44:16,060 --> 00:44:19,020
 so I couldn't find out if she was lying.

921
00:44:19,020 --> 00:44:24,020
 But it could be that you've lost one of your eyes so you've woken up with one eye or that

922
00:44:24,020 --> 00:44:27,440
 you've woken up with someone else's eye in addition to your own.

923
00:44:27,440 --> 00:44:31,440
 It's either one or three eyes you've got altogether, isn't it?

924
00:44:31,440 --> 00:44:32,440
 Yes, exactly.

925
00:44:32,440 --> 00:44:33,440
 Yeah.

926
00:44:33,440 --> 00:44:34,440
 Which would you prefer?

927
00:44:34,440 --> 00:44:35,440
 Oh.

928
00:44:35,440 --> 00:44:36,440
 I should think three.

929
00:44:36,440 --> 00:44:37,440
 I don't know.

930
00:44:37,440 --> 00:44:39,120
 That implies you might have done something awful though.

931
00:44:39,120 --> 00:44:40,120
 Does it?

932
00:44:40,120 --> 00:44:43,440
 I think that waking up with only one eye implies that something awful has happened.

933
00:44:43,440 --> 00:44:46,960
 No, but I mean, I think it depends if you'd rather harm yourself or someone else James.

934
00:44:46,960 --> 00:44:49,280
 Maybe that's the difference between you and me, you know?

935
00:44:49,280 --> 00:44:53,080
 Well, one other difference between you and me is I assumed I just found the eye.

936
00:44:53,080 --> 00:44:54,080
 I need to.

937
00:44:54,080 --> 00:44:56,160
 I've done something awful to someone to get it.

938
00:44:56,160 --> 00:44:58,160
 I assume I've gouged it out of a love ride.

939
00:44:58,160 --> 00:44:59,160
 I've just seen James.

940
00:44:59,160 --> 00:45:03,160
 You're happy with the three eye option yet the three sock option you seem to be very hesitant

941
00:45:03,160 --> 00:45:04,160
 to have.

942
00:45:04,160 --> 00:45:09,680
 Well, what I'm thinking is if I've had three more eyes, then I might have to have some eyes.

943
00:45:09,680 --> 00:45:12,440
 But James, that will take longer to match them all up.

944
00:45:12,440 --> 00:45:13,440
 Yep.

945
00:45:13,440 --> 00:45:14,440
 You're absolutely right.

946
00:45:14,440 --> 00:45:16,640
 You've got a big pile of eyes that you have to match with.

947
00:45:16,640 --> 00:45:17,640
 Yeah.

948
00:45:17,640 --> 00:45:18,640
 Not if they're all the same colours.

949
00:45:18,640 --> 00:45:20,640
 As long as you've got all blue eyes, you're fine, right?

950
00:45:20,640 --> 00:45:21,640
 Yep.

951
00:45:21,640 --> 00:45:22,640
 Yeah, that's true.

952
00:45:22,640 --> 00:45:24,840
 So if you're ever going to be gouging out people's eyes, why don't go for people

953
00:45:24,840 --> 00:45:25,840
 with the same eye colour.

954
00:45:25,840 --> 00:45:26,840
 Just a little tip.

955
00:45:26,840 --> 00:45:31,400
 Probably an amateur to the professional murderous out there.

956
00:45:31,400 --> 00:45:37,520
 I think I would definitely hope for the chance that I had done something horrible over the

957
00:45:37,520 --> 00:45:40,240
 guarantee of having lost an eye.

958
00:45:40,240 --> 00:45:44,120
 Because I trust my drunken self not to take someone's eye.

959
00:45:44,120 --> 00:45:45,120
 Yeah.

960
00:45:45,120 --> 00:45:46,120
 And maybe...

961
00:45:46,120 --> 00:45:49,360
 You take a gamble and not having removed someone's eye by force rather than the guarantee

962
00:45:49,360 --> 00:45:50,360
 of having your own eye.

963
00:45:50,360 --> 00:45:56,680
 But that may be an inflated sense of my own generosity and pleasantness when drunk.

964
00:45:56,680 --> 00:45:57,680
 Well, yeah.

965
00:45:57,680 --> 00:46:01,200
 Because you and I went on a big night out, quite recently, Andy.

966
00:46:01,200 --> 00:46:02,200
 Didn't we?

967
00:46:02,200 --> 00:46:03,200
 We did.

968
00:46:03,200 --> 00:46:04,840
 How we were the last two men standing for the end of that night out.

969
00:46:04,840 --> 00:46:07,400
 And James, you've been missing three fingers ever since.

970
00:46:07,400 --> 00:46:08,400
 So hangovers.

971
00:46:08,400 --> 00:46:09,400
 Yeah.

972
00:46:09,400 --> 00:46:10,400
 Mmm.

973
00:46:10,400 --> 00:46:11,400
 They're not fun.

974
00:46:11,400 --> 00:46:12,400
 How they?

975
00:46:12,400 --> 00:46:13,400
 No.

976
00:46:13,400 --> 00:46:16,720
 And they're very damaging.

977
00:46:16,720 --> 00:46:21,480
 So on average, 200,000 British workers turn up to work hungover every day.

978
00:46:21,480 --> 00:46:25,920
 And I imagine in these days a lockdown more than that.

979
00:46:25,920 --> 00:46:30,320
 And there's been a couple of papers that have pointed out it's weird that not more research

980
00:46:30,320 --> 00:46:35,640
 has gone into it because it has a massive impact on the economy and on society.

981
00:46:35,640 --> 00:46:41,400
 That number of people being quite debilitating the ill on a daily basis is losing the country

982
00:46:41,400 --> 00:46:42,880
 a lot of money.

983
00:46:42,880 --> 00:46:46,560
 And I was reading one editorial in the current drug abuse journal, which says it's

984
00:46:46,560 --> 00:46:47,560
 really surprising.

985
00:46:47,560 --> 00:46:50,440
 We haven't come up with a cure because of these consequences.

986
00:46:50,440 --> 00:46:52,800
 And it speculates that there's probably ethical reasons.

987
00:46:52,800 --> 00:46:55,600
 So people basically think, a hangover is kind of your punishment.

988
00:46:55,600 --> 00:46:56,600
 You got drunk.

989
00:46:56,600 --> 00:46:59,280
 You can stop getting drunk and then not have hangovers.

990
00:46:59,280 --> 00:47:04,360
 But the journal points out that people assume a hangover's punishment that will prevent

991
00:47:04,360 --> 00:47:06,440
 similar drinking episodes in future.

992
00:47:06,440 --> 00:47:09,640
 However, there is no scientific evidence that supports this assumption.

993
00:47:09,640 --> 00:47:13,920
 Whereas during the hangover, people often state they will never drink again.

994
00:47:13,920 --> 00:47:15,480
 This has never been found to happen.

995
00:47:15,480 --> 00:47:16,480
 It's true.

996
00:47:16,480 --> 00:47:17,480
 That's true.

997
00:47:17,480 --> 00:47:23,000
 The way I like to look at it is you're kind of borrowing some fun from the next day, right?

998
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:28,720
 So if you go out drinking on Friday, then you're borrowing some of Saturday morning's fun

999
00:47:28,720 --> 00:47:30,560
 and having it on Friday night.

1000
00:47:30,560 --> 00:47:35,320
 So you have more fun on Friday, but then on Saturday, you just feel like not fun at all,

1001
00:47:35,320 --> 00:47:36,320
 right?

1002
00:47:36,320 --> 00:47:37,320
 That's a really good way of looking.

1003
00:47:37,320 --> 00:47:39,600
 Oh my God, that's an amazing way of thinking about it.

1004
00:47:39,600 --> 00:47:45,360
 But that explains because I'm very keen on deferring gratification as far as possible.

1005
00:47:45,360 --> 00:47:49,960
 Which probably explains why I'm not a very big drinker because I think, well, I'd rather

1006
00:47:49,960 --> 00:47:54,960
 have no fun at all tonight in the hope of having lots tomorrow.

1007
00:47:54,960 --> 00:48:00,780
 Well, what you could do is play the lottery, like a friend of mine does, where he buys lottery

1008
00:48:00,780 --> 00:48:06,120
 ticket and then he doesn't look at it until the next week, until after the next week's

1009
00:48:06,120 --> 00:48:08,040
 draw has been made.

1010
00:48:08,040 --> 00:48:10,360
 And he's already bought next week's lottery ticket.

1011
00:48:10,360 --> 00:48:15,080
 And what that means is that he always potentially has a winning lottery ticket in his

1012
00:48:15,080 --> 00:48:16,080
 wallet.

1013
00:48:16,080 --> 00:48:19,400
 So he's always got a potentially lottery winning ticket on him.

1014
00:48:19,400 --> 00:48:20,400
 Yeah, exactly.

1015
00:48:20,400 --> 00:48:26,040
 Is he a happy man or is he a bit weird?

1016
00:48:26,040 --> 00:48:27,040
 Is you, isn't it?

1017
00:48:27,040 --> 00:48:28,040
 It's him.

1018
00:48:28,040 --> 00:48:30,560
 Oh God.

1019
00:48:30,560 --> 00:48:35,600
 I was reading about a pretty spectacular hangover that happened in China.

1020
00:48:35,600 --> 00:48:41,280
 There's a guy called Jiang Wu, who was staying at a bed and breakfast in Qingdao.

1021
00:48:41,280 --> 00:48:44,880
 He had fallen asleep in what he thought was his bed and breakfast.

1022
00:48:44,880 --> 00:48:50,120
 It actually turned out to be a shipping container that was being loaded the very next morning

1023
00:48:50,120 --> 00:48:53,680
 onto a cargo that was going to set sail for Los Angeles.

1024
00:48:53,680 --> 00:48:57,200
 So he woke up inside the container.

1025
00:48:57,200 --> 00:48:59,880
 He luckily had his phone on him, who was called as friends.

1026
00:48:59,880 --> 00:49:02,120
 He couldn't get through to a bunch of people called the police.

1027
00:49:02,120 --> 00:49:06,080
 Eventually, they worked out where he might be by tracking the phone.

1028
00:49:06,080 --> 00:49:11,440
 And they found him in a stack of cargo containers that were reaching 60 feet high.

1029
00:49:11,440 --> 00:49:13,480
 And they had to go through.

1030
00:49:13,480 --> 00:49:17,440
 I'd log about, and if he'd not, if he'd not work enough, if it'd been a few hours later,

1031
00:49:17,440 --> 00:49:21,280
 I think they said he would have been on his way to Los Angeles.

1032
00:49:21,280 --> 00:49:22,280
 Oh my God.

1033
00:49:22,280 --> 00:49:24,080
 It's a pretty holiday.

1034
00:49:24,080 --> 00:49:31,880
 There's quality of Airbnb's in the city you mentioned, then, must be so low.

1035
00:49:31,880 --> 00:49:35,520
 Maybe they have extremely luxury shipping containers.

1036
00:49:35,520 --> 00:49:36,520
 Yeah, maybe.

1037
00:49:36,520 --> 00:49:37,520
 Yeah.

1038
00:49:37,520 --> 00:49:38,520
 No.

1039
00:49:38,520 --> 00:49:42,680
 I actually have a favourite hangover that I've, I thought it's my favourite hangover for

1040
00:49:42,680 --> 00:49:45,040
 a long time, and I'm so glad I get to share it.

1041
00:49:45,040 --> 00:49:46,280
 It's Alexander the Great.

1042
00:49:46,280 --> 00:49:48,640
 I think he had the best hangover of all time.

1043
00:49:48,640 --> 00:49:49,640
 OK.

1044
00:49:49,640 --> 00:49:55,440
 So this is in 330 BC, and one of his greatest conquests was he conquered Persepolis.

1045
00:49:55,440 --> 00:49:58,640
 It was the Persian capital, and they've been building up to it for ages.

1046
00:49:58,640 --> 00:50:01,560
 It's this huge, historic moment.

1047
00:50:01,560 --> 00:50:04,920
 And it had a magnificent palace, or series of palaces.

1048
00:50:04,920 --> 00:50:09,880
 And they had hundreds of years' worth of great Persian art and sculpture and writing

1049
00:50:09,880 --> 00:50:10,880
 and lots of treasure.

1050
00:50:10,880 --> 00:50:12,760
 It was the proper jewel of the empire.

1051
00:50:12,760 --> 00:50:16,400
 So anyway, Alexander the Great storms in with his troops takes over this empire.

1052
00:50:16,400 --> 00:50:18,720
 It's the capital, massive moment.

1053
00:50:18,720 --> 00:50:23,400
 And then, so according to one account, everyone got really pissed, as you do, celebrating,

1054
00:50:23,400 --> 00:50:25,600
 absolutely hammers.

1055
00:50:25,600 --> 00:50:30,960
 And apparently, the drinking was far advanced, and Drunken Madness took possession of their

1056
00:50:30,960 --> 00:50:31,960
 minds.

1057
00:50:31,960 --> 00:50:35,880
 And then, according to various accounts, either Alexander and his assistance decided,

1058
00:50:35,880 --> 00:50:40,760
 or this woman decided, who was one of their mistresses, decided that what they should

1059
00:50:40,760 --> 00:50:43,720
 do is they should just burn the whole place down.

1060
00:50:43,720 --> 00:50:49,200
 So she said, wouldn't it be really funny if you got us a bunch of women to burn down this

1061
00:50:49,200 --> 00:50:52,040
 amazing Persian city that's taken so long to build?

1062
00:50:52,040 --> 00:50:56,280
 And they giddy with wine decided that would indeed be absolutely hilarious.

1063
00:50:56,280 --> 00:50:59,000
 And they burnt down the entire place.

1064
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:03,520
 And so I just love the added Alexander the Great woke up the next morning in his newly conquered

1065
00:51:03,520 --> 00:51:04,520
 palace in the city.

1066
00:51:04,520 --> 00:51:07,240
 And went, oh my god, what have I done?

1067
00:51:07,240 --> 00:51:08,240
 Wow.

1068
00:51:08,240 --> 00:51:09,240
 And that's it.

1069
00:51:09,240 --> 00:51:11,200
 And destroyed the Great, and we'll never have that.

1070
00:51:11,200 --> 00:51:14,000
 We'll never have the great jewel of that Persian empire.

1071
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:19,040
 They need to make that into a movie, a sort of historical version of the hangover, the movie

1072
00:51:19,040 --> 00:51:23,520
 just to see what his 24 hours were opposed to that.

1073
00:51:23,520 --> 00:51:24,520
 Wow.

1074
00:51:24,520 --> 00:51:29,240
 The ancient cures are so much fun for hangovers.

1075
00:51:29,240 --> 00:51:34,240
 So there was a big thing of wearing a wreath of flowers in your hair.

1076
00:51:34,240 --> 00:51:38,000
 If you did that while drinking, doctors thought that had curative properties, and that you

1077
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:42,080
 might not get the hangover the next day, did they have to be specific flowers, do you think?

1078
00:51:42,080 --> 00:51:45,360
 I think they probably would have been because that was a big thing, wasn't it?

1079
00:51:45,360 --> 00:51:47,760
 You know, this will cure this and so on.

1080
00:51:47,760 --> 00:51:51,200
 But we know that the treatises about this were written.

1081
00:51:51,200 --> 00:51:55,000
 We just don't know what was in them because we just have references to them.

1082
00:51:55,000 --> 00:51:58,120
 So we don't know exactly which flowers were for which drinks.

1083
00:51:58,120 --> 00:52:00,040
 It's not very helpful, is it?

1084
00:52:00,040 --> 00:52:01,040
 I know.

1085
00:52:01,040 --> 00:52:02,040
 So lovely idea as well.

1086
00:52:02,040 --> 00:52:05,880
 Everyone just in the pub is wearing a wreath of flowers on their head while they get

1087
00:52:05,880 --> 00:52:06,880
 battered.

1088
00:52:06,880 --> 00:52:07,880
 It was quite nice.

1089
00:52:07,880 --> 00:52:14,560
 There was being boiled in a coffin and then buried in hay, which is less nice.

1090
00:52:14,560 --> 00:52:16,400
 This is an alpine tradition.

1091
00:52:16,400 --> 00:52:20,840
 I've read about it in this book, which I really want to get full of books, by a guy called

1092
00:52:20,840 --> 00:52:22,880
 Shaunasi Bishop's Stool.

1093
00:52:22,880 --> 00:52:27,120
 And he's written a book called "Hungover," the morning after, and "One Man's Quest" for

1094
00:52:27,120 --> 00:52:28,120
 the cure.

1095
00:52:28,120 --> 00:52:32,120
 And he basically went on this quest of getting drunk every single night in order that he

1096
00:52:32,120 --> 00:52:33,120
 could test out.

1097
00:52:33,120 --> 00:52:39,400
 And he tried this one, which is traditional, where you lie in this wooden coffin in a dark

1098
00:52:39,400 --> 00:52:45,460
 room and you shut in, and then this lady scoops boiling water into it till you're really hot,

1099
00:52:45,460 --> 00:52:49,240
 and then you get lifted out and chucked into a massive pile of hay and then covered up

1100
00:52:49,240 --> 00:52:50,240
 with hay.

1101
00:52:50,240 --> 00:52:52,480
 And then she digs you out and you're good to go.

1102
00:52:52,480 --> 00:52:54,520
 I swear for tries, isn't it?

1103
00:52:54,520 --> 00:52:55,520
 Is it for tries?

1104
00:52:55,520 --> 00:52:57,920
 Does he report what it's like?

1105
00:52:57,920 --> 00:52:58,920
 Did it work?

1106
00:52:58,920 --> 00:53:03,840
 Because he felt sort of euphoric afterwards, but he didn't actually seem to say that it

1107
00:53:03,840 --> 00:53:09,400
 definitely worked, but he did come up with a hangover cure in this book, and I trust this

1108
00:53:09,400 --> 00:53:12,920
 more than anything, because no one's come up with a proper hangover cure, except this guy

1109
00:53:12,920 --> 00:53:19,240
 who said, "The only solution to the proper hangover symptoms of nausea and headache, basically."

1110
00:53:19,240 --> 00:53:22,540
 So we don't really care about tiredness and stuff, that's just like snap out of it, have

1111
00:53:22,540 --> 00:53:23,540
 a coffee.

1112
00:53:23,540 --> 00:53:28,040
 But nausea and headache, before you go to sleep, take milk thistle for your liver and

1113
00:53:28,040 --> 00:53:33,480
 then you take an amino acid called enacetylcystine, apparently, which is inhaled as mist.

1114
00:53:33,480 --> 00:53:35,900
 I looked it up, you can inhale it as mist, right?

1115
00:53:35,900 --> 00:53:39,360
 Then take vitamins B1, B6 and B12 and some frankincense.

1116
00:53:39,360 --> 00:53:40,360
 If you do that.

1117
00:53:40,360 --> 00:53:43,120
 Well, we're going to get all this stuff.

1118
00:53:43,120 --> 00:53:48,480
 I thought you might be growing it in your garden, I think it'd be easier for me to fight

1119
00:53:48,480 --> 00:53:52,320
 a coffin, some hay, you're the Swiss lady.

1120
00:53:52,320 --> 00:53:53,320
 Yeah.

1121
00:53:53,320 --> 00:53:57,480
 Anna, I love the fact that in a time where we cannot buy tomatoes or pasta, you'll

1122
00:53:57,480 --> 00:53:58,480
 recommend it.

1123
00:53:58,480 --> 00:54:00,120
 People go out and get themselves some frankincense.

1124
00:54:00,120 --> 00:54:07,160
 If you go to Tesco, the frankincense is completely empty at the moment, but you should be able

1125
00:54:07,160 --> 00:54:11,400
 to inhale it as a mist, so just go and buy a packet of mist and your local shop.

1126
00:54:11,400 --> 00:54:12,400
 Guys.

1127
00:54:12,400 --> 00:54:19,640
 I just, there hasn't been as much of a run on mist as the house been on Exfer Institute.

1128
00:54:19,640 --> 00:54:26,520
 Okay, that's it.

1129
00:54:26,520 --> 00:54:27,520
 That is all of our facts.

1130
00:54:27,520 --> 00:54:28,880
 Thank you so much for listening.

1131
00:54:28,880 --> 00:54:31,760

 Well, you can go to our group account, which is at no such thing.

1142

 You can go to our website.

1143
00:54:47,320 --> 00:54:48,760
 No such thing as a fish.com.

1144
00:54:48,760 --> 00:54:49,760
 Do check it out.

1145
00:54:49,760 --> 00:54:51,360
 We have all of our previous episodes up there.

1146
00:54:51,360 --> 00:54:52,360
 It's a merchandise.

1147
00:54:52,360 --> 00:54:53,800
 There's a lot of stuff to check out.

1148
00:54:53,800 --> 00:54:54,800
 Do go.

1149
00:54:54,800 --> 00:54:57,120
 Anyway, we'll be back again next week with another episode.

1150
00:54:57,120 --> 00:55:01,000
 In the meantime, we do really hope that you're all doing okay, that your family's okay,

1151
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:02,000
 your friends are okay.

1152
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:03,240
 Please stay indoors.

1153
00:55:03,240 --> 00:55:04,480
 We will get through this.

1154
00:55:04,480 --> 00:55:07,640
 And thanks for continuing to listen to us throughout this whole process.

1155
00:55:07,640 --> 00:55:09,480
 We'll see you again next week.

1156
00:55:09,480 --> 00:55:09,840
 Goodbye.
