00:00:13,00:00:19,"Hello, and welcome to another Working From Home episode of No Such Thing as a Fish,"
00:00:19,00:00:24,a weekly podcast not coming to you from the QI offices in Covent Garden.
00:00:24,00:00:28,"My name is Dan Schreiber, I am sitting here with Anichezinski, Andrew Hunter Murray, and"
00:00:28,00:00:33,"James Harkin, and once again, we have gathered around the microphones with our four favorite"
00:00:33,00:00:39,"facts from the last seven days, and in no particular order, here we go."
00:00:39,00:00:40,"Starting with you, Anna."
00:00:40,00:00:46,"My fact this week is that when people accidentally swallow coins, they're stomachs, sometimes"
00:00:46,00:00:47,punch holes in them.
00:00:47,00:00:51,"I think this is so cool, and it's quite a new thing."
00:00:51,00:00:54,"I'm not suggesting you should swallow a coin to test it out, but-"
00:00:54,00:00:57,"Anna, when you say it's quite a new thing, do you mean in the past when people swallow"
00:00:57,00:00:59,"coins, it's not done that?"
00:00:59,00:01:00,Yes.
00:01:00,00:01:01,Wow.
00:01:01,00:01:04,"So you didn't mean that coins are a relatively recent human invention, and we didn't have"
00:01:04,00:01:07,"the capacity to swallow them until 8000 years ago, right?"
00:01:07,00:01:08,I didn't mean that.
00:01:08,00:01:11,"No, people have been swallowing coins since time immemorial."
00:01:11,00:01:14,It's just that our stomachs have evolved is what you're saying.
00:01:14,00:01:16,"Exactly, in the last 20 years our stomachs have completely changed."
00:01:16,00:01:22,"No, that's not what's happened to either, coins have changed though, so this was a problem"
00:01:22,00:01:27,"that was discovered in America in the 90s, and it turned out that copper coins had"
00:01:27,00:01:32,"been swapped for copper-covered zinc coins, and if you swallow copper, then your stomach"
00:01:32,00:01:35,"acid doesn't really affect it, it can just go through, come out the other end, but if you"
00:01:35,00:01:41,"got zinc in there, the stomach acid finds it much easier to chip away at it, and so doctors"
00:01:41,00:01:43,"were finding in the 90s, they were x-raying kids."
00:01:43,00:01:46,"They said they had stomach problems, for instance, and they saw these kind of discs with"
00:01:46,00:01:50,"lots of holes in them, like really neat holes punched in them, and they didn't really know"
00:01:50,00:01:54,"what they were, and turned out they were coins, but made of zinc, and they had the holes"
00:01:54,00:01:57,"punched, and so how cool is that?"
00:01:57,00:01:58,"Yeah, it's amazing."
00:01:58,00:02:00,How come it doesn't dissolve the entire coin?
00:02:00,00:02:02,Why is it so neatly just punching holes in it?
00:02:02,00:02:07,"Well, I would guess that the copper that the zinc coins are sometimes covered with can erode"
00:02:07,00:02:10,"a bit with use, so I think sometimes bits of copper will have come off on parts of the"
00:02:10,00:02:14,"surface, and not on others, and if the acid can get through the copper, it can suddenly"
00:02:14,00:02:18,"penetrate through the zinc, so it'll be on the bits of the coin where the copper hasn't"
00:02:18,00:02:19,been eroded.
00:02:19,00:02:20,That's clever.
00:02:20,00:02:21,Super clever.
00:02:21,00:02:26,Isn't there a country where coins have holes in them already?
00:02:26,00:02:27,I'm sure…
00:02:27,00:02:28,"Yeah, loads of countries."
00:02:28,00:02:29,Yeah.
00:02:29,00:02:30,There's a square hole.
00:02:30,00:02:33,I'm sure there's a country which has either a square or a round hole.
00:02:33,00:02:35,It's probably one of the two in the middle of it.
00:02:35,00:02:36,Yeah.
00:02:36,00:02:37,I can't remember which country that is really annoying.
00:02:37,00:02:41,"Well, the way they manufacture those is they get someone at the Royal Mint to swallow"
00:02:41,00:02:42,every single coin.
00:02:42,00:02:44,It's a very hard choice of process.
00:02:44,00:02:47,"It's very hard to retrieve them at the end, though, isn't it?"
00:02:47,00:02:52,"It's not all dogs like the worst fruit machine ever, the money comes out at the end, but"
00:02:52,00:02:53,you're not really excited by it.
00:02:53,00:02:54,Yeah.
00:02:54,00:02:59,"You are getting, though, a square hole out of a round hole at the end of it."
00:02:59,00:03:00,Yeah.
00:03:00,00:03:01,"Oh, that's cool."
00:03:01,00:03:02,Yeah.
00:03:02,00:03:03,They do it in…
00:03:03,00:03:04,"Oh, sorry."
00:03:04,00:03:05,Have you seen that?
00:03:05,00:03:09,I think Wikipedia's Twitter feed tweeted it this weekend.
00:03:09,00:03:10,Have you seen it?
00:03:10,00:03:11,It's like a Tyler in Japan.
00:03:11,00:03:12,Is it in Japan?
00:03:12,00:03:16,Where it can recognise you by your anus.
00:03:16,00:03:17,Yeah.
00:03:17,00:03:18,"Oh, yeah."
00:03:18,00:03:19,Isn't it amazing?
00:03:19,00:03:21,What an amazing bit of technology.
00:03:21,00:03:22,You like James?
00:03:22,00:03:23,You sit there.
00:03:23,00:03:26,"Well, I'm back."
00:03:26,00:03:32,"And it's just all the cameras can look at your anus and just say, ""Oh, that's you, James."""
00:03:32,00:03:33,What possible need is that?
00:03:33,00:03:39,"If you hear next door in a public toilet, if you hear a toilet going, ""Oh, no, no, no,"
00:03:39,00:03:40,"you again."""
00:03:40,00:03:45,"That's the next thing when they were consenting, isn't it?"
00:03:45,00:03:47,Is it useful for…
00:03:47,00:03:48,What is it useful for?
00:03:48,00:03:50,Is it so that if you've got lots of people in the house and you're trying to monitor your
00:03:50,00:03:53,"health, but you don't want to get confused between…"
00:03:53,00:03:54,I think it is like that.
00:03:54,00:03:59,"It's like, you know, having a Fitbit on your wrist and it can tell, like, what's wrong"
00:03:59,00:04:00,with you.
00:04:00,00:04:04,"But the thing is with the toilet, you can't really carry it around with you, so it needs"
00:04:04,00:04:05,to…
00:04:05,00:04:06,And lots of people use it.
00:04:06,00:04:09,So it kind of needs to know who's using it at any one time.
00:04:09,00:04:14,"So it can look at your VCs and decides what's wrong with you, maybe?"
00:04:14,00:04:19,"Maybe for crimes they could use it as, you know, anal recognition, you know, we might be"
00:04:19,00:04:20,able to bust criminals by…
00:04:20,00:04:28,"Well, it would save a lot of very embarrassing police line-ups, wouldn't it?"
00:04:28,00:04:30,They should call this thing a Fitbit.
00:04:30,00:04:31,That's what they should call it.
00:04:31,00:04:32,They've got to do that.
00:04:32,00:04:33,They've got to do that.
00:04:33,00:04:37,"Anyway, so that's what we've got to say about coins, I guess."
00:04:37,00:04:42,"Well, I just wanted to say, the fact that Sink reacts with your stomach acid is quite"
00:04:42,00:04:44,an interesting thing.
00:04:44,00:04:50,"So in 2015, they invented this new technology, it's like you kind of take a pill and the pill"
00:04:50,00:04:55,has like a tiny motor in it and the motor is activated.
00:04:55,00:04:58,It's made out of zinc and it's activated by your stomach acid.
00:04:58,00:05:03,So the zinc reacts with your stomach acid and generates like hydrogen bubbles and then
00:05:03,00:05:08,those bubbles mean that it can act like a torpedo and it fires through your stomach so
00:05:08,00:05:13,that it gets into your stomach wall and it can kind of lodge there and it can put stuff
00:05:13,00:05:14,into your bloodstream.
00:05:14,00:05:15,Oh wow.
00:05:15,00:05:16,Isn't that amazing?
00:05:16,00:05:17,Wow.
00:05:17,00:05:18,Awesome.
00:05:18,00:05:22,"So it's a motor that's only activated when it reacts, when the Sink reacts with the…"
00:05:22,00:05:23,Exactly.
00:05:23,00:05:24,"Hydrogen, didn't you say?"
00:05:24,00:05:28,It's Sink reacting with hydrochloric acid creating hydrogen bubbles.
00:05:28,00:05:29,That's so clever.
00:05:29,00:05:30,Genius.
00:05:30,00:05:35,"And that, isn't that what the Alanis Morissette album Jagged Little Pill is about?"
00:05:35,00:05:36,That is.
00:05:36,00:05:41,It's weird though because this technology was only invented in 2015 but that album came
00:05:41,00:05:43,out in the '90s or something.
00:05:43,00:05:45,He's got real foresight though.
00:05:45,00:05:46,Yeah.
00:05:46,00:05:47,She accidentally didn't patent the invention.
00:05:47,00:05:48,She released it as lyrics.
00:05:48,00:05:49,"Oh, I'm sorry."
00:05:49,00:05:50,How ironic.
00:05:50,00:05:51,How ironic.
00:05:51,00:05:56,"Have you got any more on this, Anna?"
00:05:56,00:06:00,"Just quickly to share some advice, please be advised number one is just don't swallow"
00:06:00,00:06:03,coins just because you want to be able to thread them on a string or whatever.
00:06:03,00:06:06,"And when I say accidentally, I guess I'm talking about children."
00:06:06,00:06:08,It's mostly them who swallow coins.
00:06:08,00:06:11,So maybe they're doing it on purpose but they don't know why.
00:06:11,00:06:15,"But the current medical advice is to doctors, if you're looking at an x-ray and you see"
00:06:15,00:06:20,"some coins in a stomach, is that if it's just a coin that's sort of intact, you can just"
00:06:20,00:06:23,"leave it, send the patient home and it'll probably pass."
00:06:23,00:06:28,"But if it's a coin with scalloped edges or holes in it, then you should endoscopically"
00:06:28,00:06:32,remove it because that implies it's been there for a bit too long and it's decided to
00:06:32,00:06:33,sort of bed down.
00:06:33,00:06:34,Oh.
00:06:34,00:06:38,That should be a medical advice out there from an amateur to the experts.
00:06:38,00:06:43,"An enthusiastic colour should though, Anna, the right, certainly."
00:06:43,00:06:45,"But stomach acid is amazing, isn't it?"
00:06:45,00:06:47,The power of stomach acid.
00:06:47,00:06:50,"If you swallow razor blades, again, don't do it because they'll slit your throat on"
00:06:50,00:06:53,"the way down, but if you do and survive it, your stomach acid can just break them right"
00:06:53,00:06:54,down.
00:06:54,00:06:55,Wow.
00:06:55,00:06:56,Incredible.
00:06:56,00:06:57,Is more acidic than battery acid.
00:06:57,00:06:58,That is amazing.
00:06:58,00:06:59,Wow.
00:06:59,00:07:05,"So crocodiles, they can secrete stomach acid 10 times faster than any other animals, which"
00:07:05,00:07:06,is this amazing.
00:07:06,00:07:09,"I mean, when you think about that, that's nuts."
00:07:09,00:07:13,And it's because they do it because they have these massive meals every so often and they
00:07:13,00:07:15,need to break them down.
00:07:15,00:07:20,"And they have, instead of, you know, we've got an aorta blood vessel in our bodies."
00:07:20,00:07:25,"They've got two, one of which supplies the heart, but one of which is a special one which"
00:07:25,00:07:26,goes to the stomach.
00:07:26,00:07:31,"And when they eat, the brain, the crocodile's brain signals the heart and it says, don't"
00:07:31,00:07:37,"send any blood to the lungs, just pump it all to the stomach via the special super highway."
00:07:37,00:07:40,"And then there's carbon, lots of carbon dioxide builds up in their blood because none of their"
00:07:40,00:07:42,blood is going to the lungs.
00:07:42,00:07:44,So the carbon dioxide is not getting out of their bloodstream.
00:07:44,00:07:50,"But what that means is that the stomach takes that blood, which is full of carbon dioxide"
00:07:50,00:07:53,and it pulls the carbon dioxide out to create more acid.
00:07:53,00:07:55,So that's how they make it.
00:07:55,00:07:59,And they can digest gazelle horns and hooves and they just eat anything and it can just
00:07:59,00:08:00,be broken down.
00:08:00,00:08:02,It's because they've got this magic method of making it.
00:08:02,00:08:03,That's incredible.
00:08:03,00:08:04,That's so cool.
00:08:04,00:08:07,"So it's like dual purpose because the vessel is, first of all, going to the stomach to help"
00:08:07,00:08:11,"it out, but also the increased carbon content of the blood can then be used."
00:08:11,00:08:12,Yeah.
00:08:12,00:08:13,They're very clever on it.
00:08:13,00:08:14,That's amazing.
00:08:14,00:08:19,"Do you know stomach acid is the reason that when you do a number two, it can sting, because"
00:08:19,00:08:22,"yeah, I thought that was really interesting."
00:08:22,00:08:26,"So it doesn't, it doesn't eat away at your stomach lining because we've got a very"
00:08:26,00:08:28,protective layer of mucus in our stomach lining.
00:08:28,00:08:34,"But if you've got a particularly bad lump of turd, then and it comes out and it really"
00:08:34,00:08:41,"breathes because it's just so polite for number two, and then you're like, okay, now what's"
00:08:41,00:08:42,another polite sitting in for that?
00:08:42,00:08:43,I forgot all the words.
00:08:43,00:08:45,I forgot all the other words.
00:08:45,00:08:47,A lump of turd.
00:08:47,00:08:48,A fecal mouser.
00:08:48,00:08:53,Then there's a little bit of stomach acid still left on the outside of it and your rectum
00:08:53,00:08:55,isn't protected from it.
00:08:55,00:08:57,Is that right?
00:08:57,00:09:00,"That's not in all cases where it stings, so is it?"
00:09:00,00:09:02,"If you have a curry, that might be due to the chilies or something."
00:09:02,00:09:05,"I think that is also due to chilies, probably, yeah."
00:09:05,00:09:08,"So that's a potent combination of stomach acid and the chili, I guess."
00:09:08,00:09:09,Gosh.
00:09:09,00:09:12,That would be a painful stool.
00:09:12,00:09:13,Yeah.
00:09:13,00:09:19,"So there's the word you should have used at a stool, that's a classy, classy way of telling"
00:09:19,00:09:20,it.
00:09:20,00:09:26,"Well, penguins, king penguins specifically, they are like the reverse of crocodiles."
00:09:26,00:09:31,"It was a crocodile thing, I said just now."
00:09:31,00:09:36,"So king penguins can basically turn themselves into a fridge, their own stomach on the inside."
00:09:36,00:09:41,They can turn it into a larder because they sometimes have to provide an emergency meal
00:09:41,00:09:47,"for their chicks, and they, as a result, don't want to digest any of their food."
00:09:47,00:09:53,"And so they stop producing stomach acid, basically, and that means that the food just, and then"
00:09:53,00:09:58,"they just have these fish in their guts for up to three weeks on end, which they can then"
00:09:58,00:10:01,"regurgitate undigested, that's how they do it."
00:10:01,00:10:02,Isn't that mental?
00:10:02,00:10:03,Wow.
00:10:03,00:10:04,Amazing.
00:10:04,00:10:05,Wow.
00:10:05,00:10:07,"And do they, do they keep it at sort of refrigerate a temperature, do we know?"
00:10:07,00:10:09,"Because otherwise, we're going to be quiet."
00:10:09,00:10:10,Quite rotten.
00:10:10,00:10:15,"I think if you're a penguin, everything, everything's a refrigerated cell, you're right."
00:10:15,00:10:16,You're right.
00:10:16,00:10:21,"And they do, Anna, they do kind of have antibacterial chemicals, which they can secrete inside themselves"
00:10:21,00:10:22,to preserve the food.
00:10:22,00:10:24,So that's how they stop it rotting.
00:10:24,00:10:25,Wow.
00:10:25,00:10:26,Yeah.
00:10:26,00:10:29,"So if you're fridge, you know, you lose power in your fridge, but you've got a penguin"
00:10:29,00:10:30,lying around.
00:10:30,00:10:32,You can store your thing in there.
00:10:32,00:10:33,Yeah.
00:10:33,00:10:34,Great.
00:10:34,00:10:40,"Um, my favorite stupid swallower, I think, is Chris Foster."
00:10:40,00:10:45,"Chris Foster from Bournemouth University, who in 2008 was out on a night out with his"
00:10:45,00:10:51,"friends, who decided that he was too drunk, so tried to take him home to his room and to stop"
00:10:51,00:10:52,them from doing this.
00:10:52,00:10:57,"He swallowed his room key and he had no memory of this, but woke up the next morning and"
00:10:57,00:11:00,"his friends were all like, mate, you swallowed your room key last night."
00:11:00,00:11:01,What you can do about it.
00:11:01,00:11:04,"And apparently, I like the detail that apparently one of his friends tried the Heimlich maneuver"
00:11:04,00:11:05,on him.
00:11:05,00:11:09,"Because you can really imagine the drunken 12 people that someone Heimlich him, just sort"
00:11:09,00:11:12,of practically crushing him.
00:11:12,00:11:15,"So yeah, he went to your hospital and said, I think I swallowed my key last night."
00:11:15,00:11:21,"And indeed, he had, and he was sent home and passed the key 31 hours later and put it back"
00:11:21,00:11:22,on the fob.
00:11:22,00:11:23,Wow.
00:11:23,00:11:25,A happy ending.
00:11:25,00:11:29,"And actually, it would have a slightly bigger hole in the key, so it would be easier to get"
00:11:29,00:11:30,it on his phone.
00:11:30,00:11:31,Absolutely.
00:11:31,00:11:32,That's why he did it.
00:11:32,00:11:35,It's very clear thinking drunkenness.
00:11:35,00:11:40,"My favorite swallower, sorry, we seem to be playing a game of my favorite swallower,"
00:11:40,00:11:43,would probably be a guy from the 19th century.
00:11:43,00:11:45,Have you heard of the human ostrich?
00:11:45,00:11:46,No.
00:11:46,00:11:48,I haven't heard of the human ostrich.
00:11:48,00:11:50,This was a thing.
00:11:50,00:11:53,"And in fact, it's not even just one person."
00:11:53,00:11:57,"There were loads of actors whose standard thing was the human ostrich, where their trick"
00:11:57,00:12:00,was just swallowing cutlery or glass.
00:12:00,00:12:05,And they were kind of an adjunct to the sword swallowing fraternity.
00:12:05,00:12:06,And that was just what they did.
00:12:06,00:12:11,"So there was a guy called Alfonso, who would eat glass and cork and cotton and wool."
00:12:11,00:12:14,And it sounds more like sort of a swallowing apprentice's or interns.
00:12:14,00:12:18,"You know, you start off with a teaspoon, up to a dessert spoon."
00:12:18,00:12:22,"That is how you learn to swallow a swallowing sort, though, not with a teaspoon, first."
00:12:22,00:12:23,Well.
00:12:23,00:12:25,That would be something a bit bigger than that.
00:12:25,00:12:30,"It's really, so I've been reading the files of the SSAI, which is the Swallow's Association"
00:12:30,00:12:35,"International, and they were surveyed about their work."
00:12:35,00:12:39,"And there were 46 of them who got surveyed, because there are only 100 or 200 people"
00:12:39,00:12:41,in the world who do this for a living.
00:12:41,00:12:48,"And the 46 people between them had swallowed 2,000 swords over the previous three months."
00:12:48,00:12:50,Half of them had swallowed more than one sword.
00:12:50,00:12:56,"Five of them had swallowed 10 swords at a time, and one person had swallowed 16 swords simultaneously."
00:12:56,00:12:57,Simultaneously.
00:12:57,00:12:58,Simultaneously.
00:12:58,00:12:59,"Simultaneously, I know."
00:12:59,00:13:00,I know.
00:13:00,00:13:03,"And they all got asked about, you know, their tips and tricks."
00:13:03,00:13:06,And it was a study in the British Medical Journal that they were surveyed for.
00:13:06,00:13:12,"So it was trying to work out what injures them, and it turns out it's stubbed toes, actually."
00:13:12,00:13:16,"I was just thinking, right, you don't see swords much these days, do you?"
00:13:16,00:13:21,"I mean, people don't use swords much for their original purpose."
00:13:21,00:13:27,"So I just wondered, if you're a sword manufacturer, what percentage of them get swallowed, come"
00:13:27,00:13:28,to you.
00:13:28,00:13:34,Are you tempted as a sword manufacturer to just start rounding off the edges to make it
00:13:34,00:13:36,slightly easier for these guys?
00:13:36,00:13:37,Yeah.
00:13:37,00:13:38,That's exactly what I'm thinking.
00:13:38,00:13:40,"If you're a sword manufacturer, you might as well go for where they're back then."
00:13:40,00:13:41,Yeah.
00:13:41,00:13:42,What?
00:13:42,00:13:43,"Make them taste nice, maybe."
00:13:43,00:13:44,Yes.
00:13:44,00:13:45,Like a flavoured condom.
00:13:45,00:13:46,But with a sword.
00:13:46,00:13:47,"Well, they have a sheath."
00:13:47,00:13:48,Don't they?
00:13:48,00:13:49,"So, they do."
00:13:49,00:13:51,But the person is the sheath.
00:13:51,00:13:52,Yes.
00:13:52,00:13:53,That's interesting.
00:13:53,00:13:59,"The aim, they said, is to become a living scabbard for the sword."
00:13:59,00:14:00,That's not right.
00:14:00,00:14:01,Yeah.
00:14:01,00:14:05,"And because the aim, really, I mean, when you're swallowing a sword, the aim is not to swallow."
00:14:05,00:14:07,Swallowing contracts all the muscles all the way down.
00:14:07,00:14:09,This is a disastrous thing to do.
00:14:09,00:14:10,"So, misnomer, isn't it, really?"
00:14:10,00:14:11,It really is.
00:14:11,00:14:12,Yeah.
00:14:12,00:14:14,"So, we should call them living scabbards, I think."
00:14:14,00:14:19,"And that's actually what the wealthiest knights in Medieval times used to have, isn't it?"
00:14:19,00:14:24,One of their servants would be there at their hip.
00:14:24,00:14:29,"And it's the wealthier of the knight, you are, the more swords your living scabbard can accommodate."
00:14:29,00:14:31,"So, it's like choosing a golfer."
00:14:31,00:14:32,Yeah.
00:14:32,00:14:33,Yeah.
00:14:33,00:14:38,"Anna, when you sent us this fact, you sent us a link to new scientist, I think, which"
00:14:38,00:14:42,was your evidence for it.
00:14:42,00:14:45,"And so, I went on to new scientists to search for swallowing."
00:14:45,00:14:49,"And actually, I found some stuff about sword swallowing as well."
00:14:49,00:14:53,"So, there is a book that they talked about, which sounds amazing."
00:14:53,00:14:54,I'm definitely going to buy it.
00:14:54,00:15:01,"It's called Memoirs of a Sword Swallower by Dan Mannix, and it was published in 1951."
00:15:01,00:15:02,And it talks about all sorts of things.
00:15:02,00:15:10,"But one of them is that people used to swallow giant corkscrews, so, I know, right, so this"
00:15:10,00:15:11,is amazing.
00:15:11,00:15:15,"The way that you do it is you put the corkscrew down into your throat, and you're kind of twisting"
00:15:15,00:15:16,it round.
00:15:16,00:15:20,"And as you're doing it, you're making your pharynx, which is like the bit of your throat"
00:15:20,00:15:21,behind your mouth.
00:15:21,00:15:25,"You're making it kind of jump up and down with a muscle, and then you twist it, and then"
00:15:25,00:15:28,"you make it jump again, and then you twist it, and then you make it jump again."
00:15:28,00:15:31,And you can get the whole corkscrew down your throat.
00:15:31,00:15:32,Isn't that amazing?
00:15:32,00:15:34,"That's the step of art, isn't it?"
00:15:34,00:15:35,The step of sword swallowing.
00:15:35,00:15:42,"And, do you know what they could also swallow is a duck's penis, could you say?"
00:15:42,00:15:44,"Yes, they could."
00:15:44,00:15:46,What did they want it?
00:15:46,00:15:50,What in the cabaret act that would be?
00:15:50,00:15:53,What an excuse when your life comes home.
00:15:53,00:15:57,I'm a living scabbard.
00:15:57,00:16:01,"Do you know what I think a lot of wives, if they came home and find their heart,"
00:16:01,00:16:05,"they had been doing that, and they said, ""I'm going to start a career as a giant corkscrew"
00:16:05,00:16:06,"swallower."""
00:16:06,00:16:10,They would wish that they'd just been forlating the duck.
00:16:10,00:16:14,I'll be my position.
00:16:14,00:16:21,"Okay, it is time for fact number two, and that is Andy."
00:16:21,00:16:26,My fact is that soldiers in the Russian army weren't issued socks until 2007.
00:16:26,00:16:27,Wow.
00:16:27,00:16:28,Wow.
00:16:28,00:16:29,Wow.
00:16:29,00:16:33,"Well, they didn't go around the world fighting barefoot, did they?"
00:16:33,00:16:35,"They didn't get... no, no, they're not hippies."
00:16:35,00:16:39,"They're the opposite of hippies in the Russian army, they're very, very tough people."
00:16:39,00:16:44,But they didn't have the socks that we know and love today.
00:16:44,00:16:48,Was it a case of bringing your own socks kind of thing?
00:16:48,00:16:49,No.
00:16:49,00:16:54,"They were issued with footwear for between the shoe and the foot, but the thing that the"
00:16:54,00:17:00,"Russian army wore for centuries, actually, were these squares of cloth called Port Yankee."
00:17:00,00:17:02,I hope I'm pronouncing that right.
00:17:02,00:17:07,"They had cotton ones for the summer and warmer, flannel ones for the winter, and they came"
00:17:07,00:17:13,in a square and you had to do this little elaborate dance of wrapping them around your foot.
00:17:13,00:17:15,"But the thing is, they had lots of advantages."
00:17:15,00:17:19,"So they were cheap to make, they were very easy to wash and dry and mend, and if you've"
00:17:19,00:17:23,"got a hole in it, it didn't matter, because there were several layers to them, so one"
00:17:23,00:17:26,"hole, you know, is not a problem."
00:17:26,00:17:28,So there were lots of advantages.
00:17:28,00:17:29,Yeah.
00:17:29,00:17:35,"So I asked my father-in-law, who was in the Russian army, actually, about these, and he said,"
00:17:35,00:17:41,"yeah, they're pretty good, actually, because one thing is the boots they would give you were"
00:17:41,00:17:43,extremely un-flexible.
00:17:43,00:17:47,So let's say they probably wouldn't fit exactly the shape of your foot.
00:17:47,00:17:52,"In fact, they almost certainly wouldn't, but what you could do with these wraps is you"
00:17:52,00:17:56,"could kind of stuff a little bit here, stuff a little bit there, kind of do it on two layers"
00:17:56,00:18:01,"here and on one layer there, so it would make your foot fit exactly in the size of your"
00:18:01,00:18:02,boot.
00:18:02,00:18:06,They could turn your foot into whatever size and shape you'd need it to be.
00:18:06,00:18:07,Yeah.
00:18:07,00:18:08,"Pretty much, yeah, exactly."
00:18:08,00:18:13,"I watched a video online of someone wrapping their foot up with one of these, and the process"
00:18:13,00:18:14,was very intricate.
00:18:14,00:18:17,It was like swaddling a baby.
00:18:17,00:18:21,You have to really tuck it under bits and make sure it flips over this other bit.
00:18:21,00:18:24,"So they're wearing a bag over their foot, really, an elaborate bag over their foot, rather"
00:18:24,00:18:25,than a fitted sock?
00:18:25,00:18:26,Yeah.
00:18:26,00:18:29,"I mean, what is a sock, but a bag?"
00:18:29,00:18:30,But a footbag?
00:18:30,00:18:31,That's true.
00:18:31,00:18:34,"A sock is more of a bag than these squares of cloth, actually."
00:18:34,00:18:35,In a sense.
00:18:35,00:18:41,"I suppose because it's comfortably fitted to one's foot, it feels less baggy, but yeah."
00:18:41,00:18:43,"But socks are really important, if you're in the army, right?"
00:18:43,00:18:44,They're super important.
00:18:44,00:18:45,Yeah.
00:18:45,00:18:50,"So in the world where one, for instance, they needed socks for their troops."
00:18:50,00:18:56,"And so they got people to knit them, because in those days, the way you made socks was by"
00:18:56,00:18:57,knitting them.
00:18:57,00:19:00,You didn't have the big manufacturing processes that you have today.
00:19:00,00:19:05,And the problem with people knitting socks is not everyone is particularly good at knitting.
00:19:05,00:19:06,"Oh, God."
00:19:06,00:19:09,I would pity the soldier who had to deal with one of my socks.
00:19:09,00:19:12,"It would be hell, you'd go barefoot."
00:19:12,00:19:19,"So for instance, there was one army, one person in the army who wrote a poem, and it said,"
00:19:19,00:19:22,"""Thank you, kind lady, your socks are some fit."
00:19:22,00:19:25,"I used one for a hammock, and one for a mitt."""
00:19:25,00:19:26,No.
00:19:26,00:19:28,Very good.
00:19:28,00:19:32,I thought he was going to finish saying one for my shit.
00:19:32,00:19:33,I thought that was going to be there.
00:19:33,00:19:36,And that's why you're not the poet laureate.
00:19:36,00:19:37,I know.
00:19:37,00:19:41,We should never have submitted that rhyme to you when they asked.
00:19:41,00:19:44,"It's so hard to define sock when you start researching it, isn't it?"
00:19:44,00:19:48,"It's like, they've sort of existed forever, all they've only existed for a hundred"
00:19:48,00:19:50,years depending on how you do it.
00:19:50,00:19:53,"So, I love this sort of variety."
00:19:53,00:19:57,"And I found that, as I was really trying to get to grips with the history of them, they've"
00:19:57,00:20:02,climbed up and down the leg like nobody's business over the last two thousand years.
00:20:02,00:20:03,It's so weird.
00:20:03,00:20:08,"So you've got like, I think the oldest sock is from about two thousand years ago."
00:20:08,00:20:12,"And it kind of looks like our socks today, except it has, it was for a sandal."
00:20:12,00:20:16,And so it's like those socks that have a different bit for each of the toes.
00:20:16,00:20:20,Like it has one bit for the big toe and then a separate bit for the rest of the foot.
00:20:20,00:20:25,But then they sort of climbed up the leg gradually so they'd get longer and men were wearing
00:20:25,00:20:28,"breaches when it got to about 14th, 15th century."
00:20:28,00:20:32,So their trousers as it were will get shorter and shorter.
00:20:32,00:20:39,And then eventually it got to a time in the 1400s where socks had turned into tights that
00:20:39,00:20:43,basically revealed the arse and your tunic or your breaches have become a jacket.
00:20:43,00:20:48,And there were all these laws about who was allowed to show their bum and who wore it.
00:20:48,00:20:52,The sock was basically the full leg covering by that point.
00:20:52,00:20:55,And then they sort of descended again and got lower and lower until we have what we have
00:20:55,00:20:57,"today, which is the short sock and trousers."
00:20:57,00:20:59,So they're just up and down all the time.
00:20:59,00:21:04,"Do you know what that, that sounds like the progress of the Korean war up and down the"
00:21:04,00:21:05,Korean peninsula?
00:21:05,00:21:06,Do you remember?
00:21:06,00:21:10,Because originally the North had made its way almost to the complete South of Ireland.
00:21:10,00:21:13,And then there was a huge troop surge and they got pushed back almost to China.
00:21:13,00:21:15,And then it stabilized around it.
00:21:15,00:21:16,Is it the 38th parallel?
00:21:16,00:21:17,That's where they kind of came to the--
00:21:17,00:21:18,The 38th parallel?
00:21:18,00:21:19,Yeah.
00:21:19,00:21:23,"So maybe our socks will eventually stop at that parallel on our leg, which I guess would"
00:21:23,00:21:24,be the knee.
00:21:24,00:21:30,"Yeah, that's the parallel I'm trying to draw, and it's a parallel I regret drawing increasingly."
00:21:30,00:21:32,People used to be killed by their socks.
00:21:32,00:21:34,In the 19th century they were a real hazard.
00:21:34,00:21:36,There were lots of warnings about them.
00:21:36,00:21:39,This was in the age when dyes were quite dangerous.
00:21:39,00:21:41,They weren't dyes were deadly.
00:21:41,00:21:44,"And people used to complain constantly that certain types of socks, particularly the brightly"
00:21:44,00:21:48,"coloured ones, would leave them with these massive ulcers or swollen feet that they couldn't"
00:21:48,00:21:53,"get in and out of their boots and sort of pussy soles, and people would get infections"
00:21:53,00:21:55,from them and die.
00:21:55,00:21:59,And it got to the stage where in about the 1850s men were recommended to only wear white
00:21:59,00:22:03,"socks because if you had socks that had been dyed by certain types of dye, like a lot"
00:22:03,00:22:08,"of them contained arsenic, which was an ideal, then you were risking your very life."
00:22:08,00:22:09,Wow.
00:22:09,00:22:10,"In fact, the telegraphs--"
00:22:10,00:22:15,The socks get dyed and then you get dyed.
00:22:15,00:22:21,"Again, another reason why you're not poor at loriate, we're just coming up with a lot, aren't we?"
00:22:21,00:22:23,"But did they didn't actually kill anyone, did they?"
00:22:23,00:22:26,And I don't think there were any recorded deaths where the cause of death was put on the
00:22:26,00:22:27,former's socks.
00:22:27,00:22:32,"I didn't find the death certificates, but there were certainly journalists who said that"
00:22:32,00:22:33,they'd been killing people.
00:22:33,00:22:37,"And you can imagine with infections, people weren't very good at staving off, you know."
00:22:37,00:22:38,"I guess, yeah."
00:22:38,00:22:39,Not in the body.
00:22:39,00:22:43,"And socks advertise themselves for decades afterwards as special, wow, new, non-poisonous"
00:22:43,00:22:44,socks.
00:22:44,00:22:45,They won't kill you.
00:22:45,00:22:46,That was the thing.
00:22:46,00:22:47,Did they?
00:22:47,00:22:48,"Yeah, there are."
00:22:48,00:22:49,Victorian ads.
00:22:49,00:22:57,"In 2015, someone invented a pair of socks, which were powered by urine."
00:22:57,00:22:58,Right.
00:22:58,00:23:00,First question.
00:23:00,00:23:02,Why do you need to power your socks?
00:23:02,00:23:05,Can you not get around without powering them?
00:23:05,00:23:06,Good.
00:23:06,00:23:07,Great question.
00:23:07,00:23:08,Thank you.
00:23:08,00:23:09,"No, no, it's not the only question."
00:23:09,00:23:10,Yeah.
00:23:10,00:23:14,There's another quite important question coming up about the urine powder.
00:23:14,00:23:15,Yeah.
00:23:15,00:23:16,Yeah.
00:23:16,00:23:21,"So, what these are kind of designed for is if you are, let's say you're going for a hike"
00:23:21,00:23:29,or you're out and you get lost or you get into distress and you need to send a signal
00:23:29,00:23:30,to some people.
00:23:30,00:23:35,"But you've forgotten your phone and your, you know, pager or whatever else you were going"
00:23:35,00:23:36,to use to someone.
00:23:36,00:23:39,"Basically, you're only wearing a pair of socks, you're lost ever though."
00:23:39,00:23:40,That's right.
00:23:40,00:23:41,Yeah.
00:23:41,00:23:42,All your other clothes have gone.
00:23:42,00:23:43,Yeah.
00:23:43,00:23:44,You've woken up from a nightmare.
00:23:44,00:23:45,You shot him like yourself.
00:23:45,00:23:47,"So, what do you do?"
00:23:47,00:23:48,You're naked.
00:23:48,00:23:49,You're lost.
00:23:49,00:23:51,All you have is a pair of socks.
00:23:51,00:23:57,"You just put all you have to do is piss yourself and these, when filled with urine and activated"
00:23:57,00:24:03,"by your footsteps, they can send a little message to any prospective rescuers because they've"
00:24:03,00:24:08,got these tiny fuel cells which are turned on by fresh urine and the movement of your feet.
00:24:08,00:24:10,Why do they have to do that?
00:24:10,00:24:12,Why do they have to include the footstep bit?
00:24:12,00:24:16,"Surely you could just like, I don't know, spin them around or something."
00:24:16,00:24:21,Why do you have to put your pissy socks back on?
00:24:21,00:24:24,I don't think you need to take them off in the first place.
00:24:24,00:24:25,You just need to piss off.
00:24:25,00:24:27,Carefully weed down your legs.
00:24:27,00:24:28,Just piss on your feet.
00:24:28,00:24:29,Yeah.
00:24:29,00:24:30,Okay.
00:24:30,00:24:34,"I think that would be very difficult, especially as a woman, to actually manage to weed into"
00:24:34,00:24:36,a sock whilst wearing it.
00:24:36,00:24:41,"Actually, for a man, most of the challenges not pissing on your feet."
00:24:41,00:24:42,Yeah.
00:24:42,00:24:44,"And who's this, who's this notifying Andy?"
00:24:44,00:24:48,Is this like some unit of spin centre by the authorities?
00:24:48,00:24:49,Okay.
00:24:49,00:24:50,Yeah.
00:24:50,00:24:54,"Like, you know, you know, Prince William, when he worked for Mountain Rescue, he used to"
00:24:54,00:25:00,"talk about getting the urine sock alarm every few days, didn't he?"
00:25:00,00:25:01,Yeah.
00:25:01,00:25:05,So it means that it just proves that you're still alive and that you're worth rescuing.
00:25:05,00:25:06,Ah.
00:25:06,00:25:07,"Ah, you at that stage?"
00:25:07,00:25:08,I did not.
00:25:08,00:25:09,I didn't know.
00:25:09,00:25:10,I didn't know.
00:25:10,00:25:11,Are you really worth rescuing?
00:25:11,00:25:17,I think I'm probably rather not be rescued at that point.
00:25:17,00:25:21,I was just thinking when you said they had adverts for socks that don't kill you.
00:25:21,00:25:23,"You don't see many adverts for socks these days, do you?"
00:25:23,00:25:24,"No, that's true."
00:25:24,00:25:27,"Can you just assume you're just going to buy that, by guess?"
00:25:27,00:25:28,Yeah.
00:25:28,00:25:29,Yeah.
00:25:29,00:25:30,Yeah.
00:25:30,00:25:31,"It's usually when they do stunts, isn't it?"
00:25:31,00:25:32,Stunt advertising.
00:25:32,00:25:38,"So Ted Baker did an advert a few years ago, which was they started selling socks in odd pairs."
00:25:38,00:25:41,"So they would sell you instead of just two socks, prepare it."
00:25:41,00:25:45,They would sell you three because there was a report of how we lose an odd sock.
00:25:45,00:25:46,We always have an odd sock.
00:25:46,00:25:51,"So why not give you an extra sock so that you've always got a pair on the go, yeah?"
00:25:51,00:25:52,That's quite clever.
00:25:52,00:25:55,"I find that very annoying and discomforting, actually."
00:25:55,00:25:57,"Yeah, me too, actually."
00:25:57,00:25:58,That was very stunty.
00:25:58,00:25:59,Yeah.
00:25:59,00:26:00,They had a sock amnesty.
00:26:00,00:26:04,You were meant to bring in that one odd sock if you were able to buy the pack of three.
00:26:04,00:26:08,"Basically, what happens is, as soon as you buy these three socks, you immediately have"
00:26:08,00:26:09,an odd sock.
00:26:09,00:26:10,Yes.
00:26:10,00:26:14,"So if you buy two, if you buy two of them, then you don't, then you have three pairs of socks."
00:26:14,00:26:15,Right.
00:26:15,00:26:18,"But then you can buy three pairs of socks, aren't you?"
00:26:18,00:26:19,Yeah.
00:26:19,00:26:26,"No, but there is a thing about sorting your socks, which is how amazingly difficult it"
00:26:26,00:26:31,gets as soon as you have any reasonable number of interesting socks.
00:26:31,00:26:36,"So if you have, so, and there are two problems with sock matching, which is if you have more"
00:26:36,00:26:45,"than one pair, which I do, sorry, bragg, hashtag bragg, one of them is full of piss, though."
00:26:45,00:26:49,"But if you have more than one pair, firstly, you need to pair more socks, obviously."
00:26:49,00:26:53,"But secondly, there is a larger part of unmatched socks that you have to hunt through, right?"
00:26:53,00:26:58,"So if you have five pairs of socks, it actually takes 25 times longer to match than one pair"
00:26:58,00:26:59,of socks.
00:26:59,00:27:00,Okay.
00:27:00,00:27:01,This is by an algorithm.
00:27:01,00:27:07,"Allegedly, if you have 100 different pairs of socks, right, it would take 10,000 times"
00:27:07,00:27:12,"longer to sort them, then one pair of socks."
00:27:12,00:27:15,"No, I don't believe that."
00:27:15,00:27:19,And that's worked out that you're obviously sort of pairing them down every time you find a pair.
00:27:19,00:27:22,"Yeah, I mean, I see the algorithms done its job."
00:27:22,00:27:23,I think so.
00:27:23,00:27:24,But they haven't done trials.
00:27:24,00:27:25,The end it gets easier.
00:27:25,00:27:26,Yeah.
00:27:26,00:27:27,"Yeah, absolutely."
00:27:27,00:27:30,"But the answer, obviously, is to only buy one kind of socks and just buy a hundred of those."
00:27:30,00:27:31,Yeah.
00:27:31,00:27:32,"Hey, Andy, I've got one more question about your piss socks."
00:27:32,00:27:33,Oh my gosh.
00:27:33,00:27:34,God.
00:27:34,00:27:42,"James raised a point there before, which is sometimes it's difficult for guys to aim properly"
00:27:42,00:27:43,and that could land.
00:27:43,00:27:50,But has there been any cases where the authorities have busted into someone's house because they
00:27:50,00:27:53,pissed on their socks all the time?
00:27:53,00:27:56,"Yeah, I think that's that."
00:27:56,00:27:59,"Not as far as I know, but what a great question."
00:27:59,00:28:05,"It sounds like you haven't really done the research here, Andy."
00:28:05,00:28:07,I'm just talking about the fact that there's no sock advertising.
00:28:07,00:28:10,I really like fun socks.
00:28:10,00:28:13,"And so I'm quite surprised that people don't, you know, companies don't make a bigger"
00:28:13,00:28:14,deal out of them.
00:28:14,00:28:19,And I especially feel sorry for men when they have to wear suits or like quite bland matching
00:28:19,00:28:20,outfits.
00:28:20,00:28:25,"I know you're all wearing like cartoon themed tops today, but we're working from home."
00:28:25,00:28:29,"But that's the only way that you can really express yourself, right?"
00:28:29,00:28:31,It's by wearing stupid socks.
00:28:31,00:28:35,So I was looking at some stupid socks and I hadn't realized something that I think a lot
00:28:35,00:28:41,"of Canadians are aware of, which is that true dough engages in sock diplomacy a lot."
00:28:41,00:28:45,"And so every sort of diplomatic event he goes to, he's wearing a different and appropriate"
00:28:45,00:28:47,pair of socks.
00:28:47,00:28:51,"And it was particularly apparent when he marched in Toronto's gay pride parade, wearing"
00:28:51,00:28:56,"a rainbow striped pair, but printed with the words eedmubarak because it was also eed"
00:28:56,00:28:59,the end of Ramadan at the time.
00:28:59,00:29:00,Wow.
00:29:00,00:29:02,And they were made by a Toronto based company.
00:29:02,00:29:05,"Unfortunately, unfortunately nobody noticed any of that because he was also blacked up"
00:29:05,00:29:10,at the time.
00:29:10,00:29:16,"And I have one fact about which could have gone into this fact all the previous one, okay?"
00:29:16,00:29:17,Okay.
00:29:17,00:29:22,"So in 2014, there was a great day in an Oregon which was found to be in some distress and"
00:29:22,00:29:24,his owners took him to the vet.
00:29:24,00:29:27,"And if you combine this fact with the previous one, you know what I'm about to say, but they"
00:29:27,00:29:30,found he'd been swallowing socks.
00:29:30,00:29:31,And they've-
00:29:31,00:29:35,It's all really just now about guessing the number of pairs of socks that he's wearing
00:29:35,00:29:36,from our perspective.
00:29:36,00:29:40,How long do you think it would have taken to match the socks of that kind of reason?
00:29:40,00:29:46,I reckon the maximum number of socks that a great day can eat for your notice and take
00:29:46,00:29:49,them to the vet is 16.
00:29:49,00:29:50,Okay.
00:29:50,00:29:51,Okay.
00:29:51,00:29:52,Pairs or individuals?
00:29:52,00:29:53,Individuals.
00:29:53,00:29:55,Because I guess they wouldn't necessarily swallow them in pairs.
00:29:55,00:29:56,Go on.
00:29:56,00:29:57,Any other guesses?
00:29:57,00:30:00,"I'm going to say one sock, yes."
00:30:00,00:30:01,Wow.
00:30:01,00:30:02,Okay.
00:30:02,00:30:03,Great Danes are.
00:30:03,00:30:04,They're great.
00:30:04,00:30:05,So they can fit probably quite a lot.
00:30:05,00:30:06,I think 30 socks.
00:30:06,00:30:11,"I'm going to say, Dan, my ex had a dog who once had a sock and we had to get the sock out"
00:30:11,00:30:15,"of it, which was an interesting day for us."
00:30:15,00:30:20,But I'm not sure that the international press would have been particularly interested in
00:30:20,00:30:23,jumping to one sock.
00:30:23,00:30:26,"Or you missed an opportunity in reporting your story, James."
00:30:26,00:30:27,Yeah.
00:30:27,00:30:31,"No, that's very good tactical thinking from James."
00:30:31,00:30:33,"So thank you, Dan, for just getting one sock."
00:30:33,00:30:38,"Because normally I was assuming you would do your usual thing and guess if you can 5,000"
00:30:38,00:30:39,socks.
00:30:39,00:30:40,Exactly.
00:30:40,00:30:43,"I was going to say 100,000."
00:30:43,00:30:46,This dog had eaten 43 and a half socks.
00:30:46,00:30:47,Wow.
00:30:47,00:30:48,Yeah.
00:30:48,00:30:51,And they had to do a sockectomy on it.
00:30:51,00:30:57,"And in fact, this became news because it was published in the Trade magazine, Veterinary Practice"
00:30:57,00:30:58,News.
00:30:58,00:31:01,And they had a competition for the animal which had eaten the most unusual thing.
00:31:01,00:31:02,And this great Dan won.
00:31:02,00:31:03,Great.
00:31:03,00:31:08,But there were some other runners-up in the competition which included a frog in Texas which
00:31:08,00:31:14,had eaten the rocks from its rockery and a dog in Florida which had eaten the kebab.
00:31:14,00:31:17,"Now, that doesn't sound interesting, but it had also eaten the skewer."
00:31:17,00:31:18,"Oh, God."
00:31:18,00:31:20,That's going to hurt.
00:31:20,00:31:27,"Okay, it is time for fact number three and that is my fact."
00:31:27,00:31:33,My fact this week is that in 2016 a man won the lottery for the second time using the exact
00:31:33,00:31:36,same numbers that won it for him the first time.
00:31:36,00:31:39,That man's name is Larry Gamble's.
00:31:39,00:31:43,And he hasn't changed his name since he did this.
00:31:43,00:31:44,"No, no."
00:31:44,00:31:45,This was his name.
00:31:45,00:31:50,He also like bouncing around fields like a sheep.
00:31:50,00:31:51,He's not Larry Gamble's.
00:31:51,00:31:52,"Oh, sorry."
00:31:52,00:31:53,That's a different guy.
00:31:53,00:31:54,I think he is.
00:31:54,00:32:01,"Larry Gamble's, he's from Madison, Illinois, which is a small place south of Chicago."
00:32:01,00:32:07,And he won a million dollars in 2016 as part of a lottery and the numbers that he used were
00:32:07,00:32:12,"the same numbers that he used nine years ago when he won 50,000 in a different lottery."
00:32:12,00:32:15,So he worked twice for him.
00:32:15,00:32:20,"And yeah, he obviously made the news because of his name because of his name, you know,"
00:32:20,00:32:24,it's not like a great day in the sock.
00:32:24,00:32:29,"He was asked if he had any advice on how to win the lottery, which is a great question"
00:32:29,00:32:32,for journalists to ask.
00:32:32,00:32:36,"And he said, ""Pick your favourite numbers and stick with them."
00:32:36,00:32:37,"It worked for me."""
00:32:37,00:32:38,That is.
00:32:38,00:32:39,So there you go.
00:32:39,00:32:40,Guaranteed.
00:32:40,00:32:41,"Sure, if I were winning."
00:32:41,00:32:43,"I would argue that that's bad advice, though, right?"
00:32:43,00:32:48,"Because unless your favourite numbers are numbers that no one else likes, which is pretty"
00:32:48,00:32:52,"unlikely, statistically, you're more likely to like the number seven or the number three"
00:32:52,00:32:53,or whatever.
00:32:53,00:32:55,You want to be choosing numbers that no one likes.
00:32:55,00:32:56,You want to be choosing horrible ones.
00:32:56,00:32:57,You're right.
00:32:57,00:32:58,"Yeah, because then you get more."
00:32:58,00:33:02,"Well, there was an article I was reading, which was saying that in each national lottery"
00:33:02,00:33:08,"draw, 10,000 people on average choose the numbers one, two, three, four, five and six."
00:33:08,00:33:12,"And given the amount of most jackpots, which is about four million, that means even if"
00:33:12,00:33:13,"you win, you get four hundred quid."
00:33:13,00:33:14,Yeah.
00:33:14,00:33:15,"Oh, wow."
00:33:15,00:33:16,Because it has a split between those people.
00:33:16,00:33:17,Mad.
00:33:17,00:33:21,I reckon that that serves you right for being so unimaginative.
00:33:21,00:33:22,Agreed.
00:33:22,00:33:24,I could not agree more.
00:33:24,00:33:30,"Also, I know the number of combinations is so massive that, and I know that that is as"
00:33:30,00:33:32,likely a combination of numbers as any other.
00:33:32,00:33:33,Is that correct?
00:33:33,00:33:34,Yeah.
00:33:34,00:33:35,"Like getting those one, two, three."
00:33:35,00:33:36,"However, I think we can all agree."
00:33:36,00:33:37,"It's just not going to happen, is it?"
00:33:37,00:33:39,"It's never going to be one, two, three, four, five, six."
00:33:39,00:33:40,It's not.
00:33:40,00:33:41,You're right.
00:33:41,00:33:42,Of course not.
00:33:42,00:33:44,Imagine the statistics be damned.
00:33:44,00:33:45,It will be a complete scandal.
00:33:45,00:33:46,It will be outrageous.
00:33:46,00:33:51,"Actually, you know, you've got the first ever lottery ticket in the UK."
00:33:51,00:33:53,I think it was John Major.
00:33:53,00:33:54,"Oh, yeah."
00:33:54,00:33:55,Prime Minister.
00:33:55,00:33:58,Did they not say that he was worried that he was going to win or something?
00:33:58,00:33:59,Yes.
00:33:59,00:34:02,"He hoped he wouldn't win, because if he won, he would have to give the money back, and he"
00:34:02,00:34:07,knew that his wife would be furious if he won and then he'd have to give back the money.
00:34:07,00:34:10,"Imagine if the first ever national lottery, right?"
00:34:10,00:34:11,It came up.
00:34:11,00:34:13,"And I know if you guys remember it, you're probably too young."
00:34:13,00:34:16,I remember it because I was 16 and I could buy tickets.
00:34:16,00:34:17,It was really exciting.
00:34:17,00:34:22,"But imagine if the first ball that came out was one, and then it was two, and it was three"
00:34:22,00:34:26,"and a four, then five and six, which is equally likely it could have happened."
00:34:26,00:34:27,Yeah.
00:34:27,00:34:29,I think that would have been just the end of it.
00:34:29,00:34:30,No one would have trusted it ever again.
00:34:30,00:34:31,It would have been a scandal.
00:34:31,00:34:32,No one would ever buy a ticket again.
00:34:32,00:34:38,"And then John Major's in the corner, because he is absolutely the sort of guy who would"
00:34:38,00:34:39,have taken those numbers.
00:34:39,00:34:40,Yes.
00:34:40,00:34:41,It's just likely.
00:34:41,00:34:44,So any other combination?
00:34:44,00:34:48,"I find this sticking with the same numbers thing really weird, because I found a headline in"
00:34:48,00:34:49,the telegraph.
00:34:49,00:34:50,This just made me laugh so much.
00:34:50,00:34:55,"It said, ""Millionaire lottery winner dreamt numbers 28 years ago."""
00:34:55,00:35:05,"And this was a woman who, these numbers came to her in a dream in 1989, and then in 2017, they"
00:35:05,00:35:06,came up.
00:35:06,00:35:07,Wow.
00:35:07,00:35:12,"Did the dream tell her that it was 2017, or did she just not go round to it?"
00:35:12,00:35:14,"No, she'd been, she'd been placing the bets."
00:35:14,00:35:16,Every single week on that number.
00:35:16,00:35:18,So many ways.
00:35:18,00:35:19,Yeah.
00:35:19,00:35:20,What grandmother does that?
00:35:20,00:35:21,Okay.
00:35:21,00:35:22,My grandmother keeps the same numbers.
00:35:22,00:35:28,"I think I do see the logic in keeping the same numbers once you've decided on them, because"
00:35:28,00:35:32,"then if the numbers do come out, you feel like, ""Ah, they were my numbers, and I should have"
00:35:32,00:35:34,"put them back on this week, and I didn't do it."""
00:35:34,00:35:35,Yes.
00:35:35,00:35:39,"And once you've started doing that, see the logic between behind not stopping."
00:35:39,00:35:43,"My grandmother says that she didn't buy them one week, and that was the week when numbers"
00:35:43,00:35:44,came up.
00:35:44,00:35:50,"I just don't believe it at all, but she, that's a story in our family, she says it."
00:35:50,00:35:53,The other logical fallacy that people have is that they look at the numbers and they're
00:35:53,00:35:54,out by just one.
00:35:54,00:36:00,"And you're like, ""Ah, I had 45, and 46 came out, but apart from the fact that each ball is"
00:36:00,00:36:01,"not related, they're just numbers."""
00:36:01,00:36:02,Yeah.
00:36:02,00:36:06,"But of course, there are twice as many numbers that are won away from your number as your"
00:36:06,00:36:07,actual number.
00:36:07,00:36:08,"Oh, yeah."
00:36:08,00:36:11,So your twice is likely to be won away as the actual number.
00:36:11,00:36:12,That's a really good point.
00:36:12,00:36:13,I had thought about that.
00:36:13,00:36:17,"Andy, you were saying about the person who came up with the number through a dream."
00:36:17,00:36:19,Did you hear about this guy in Spain in the 1970s?
00:36:19,00:36:20,No.
00:36:20,00:36:21,No.
00:36:21,00:36:27,So the way it works in Spain is you could go around the shop looking for specific numbers.
00:36:27,00:36:30,They printed out the numbers and you would choose whichever one you wanted.
00:36:30,00:36:38,"This guy decided that he wanted a lottery ticket ending in 48, 48, so he went around all"
00:36:38,00:36:44,the shops and eventually found a ticket and he bought it and he won the lottery and they interviewed
00:36:44,00:36:49,"him afterwards like they always do and they said, ""Oh, why, you know, what was your secret?"""
00:36:49,00:36:52,"And he said, ""Oh, well, I was looking for this 48 and they said, ""Oh, why are you looking"
00:36:52,00:36:53,"for the 48?"""
00:36:53,00:36:58,"And he said, ""Well, I dreamt of the number seven for seven straight nights and seven times"
00:36:58,00:37:05,"seven is 48."""
00:37:05,00:37:06,So good.
00:37:06,00:37:07,And it worked.
00:37:07,00:37:08,I love to win.
00:37:08,00:37:11,Have you guys heard of Stefan Mandel?
00:37:11,00:37:14,You may well have done researching people who won the lottery lots.
00:37:14,00:37:22,So he was a Romanian economist and he ended up winning the lottery 14 times because he worked
00:37:22,00:37:29,"out that what he would do is he would form a syndicate and he grew up very, very poor"
00:37:29,00:37:30,Romania.
00:37:30,00:37:33,He wanted to earn some real money and he would find a lottery and he would wait until
00:37:33,00:37:38,the jackpot for the lottery was bigger than all possible combinations of tickets.
00:37:38,00:37:40,"So if you bought, you know, every single number."
00:37:40,00:37:44,So that only applies to certain lotteries obviously because if you did it for things like
00:37:44,00:37:50,"the Euro-Million, it will be so expensive to buy tickets for every combination."
00:37:50,00:37:56,So he formed this syndicate and he what waited and then he would just buy every single ticket.
00:37:56,00:37:59,But the main tricky thing is the logistics of it.
00:37:59,00:38:04,"So he had a team of people in Melbourne, he moved to Australia and he found a lottery in"
00:38:04,00:38:09,Virginia in the USA which had enough money in the jackpot.
00:38:09,00:38:12,So you could print your own tickets at the time.
00:38:12,00:38:15,So he printed off one ton of tickets.
00:38:15,00:38:19,He had to ship them all the way to the USA from Australia.
00:38:19,00:38:26,He waited for the jackpot to be right and then on a certain week in 1992 the jackpot hit
00:38:26,00:38:30,$15 million and he said this is the week we need to go for it.
00:38:30,00:38:36,"But he had to form a team of people to take 1.4 million tickets to a shop and queue up, pay"
00:38:36,00:38:40,"for them, get them processed and they're registered as being properly bought."
00:38:40,00:38:44,"And they had three days to do it, 1.4 million tickets."
00:38:44,00:38:50,He hired couriers who had tens of thousands of tickets each and almost all of them got
00:38:50,00:38:55,"through but there was one batch of tickets, 140,000 which weren't registered."
00:38:55,00:39:04,"There was one ticket which wasn't bought, it was one, two, three, four, five, six."
00:39:04,00:39:09,And so when the time came there was so stressed obviously that the jackpot was in that one combination
00:39:09,00:39:10,of numbers they would have missed out.
00:39:10,00:39:13,Thankfully they got it and they won.
00:39:13,00:39:16,How much was it then that ended up being divided as in how much did each person get?
00:39:16,00:39:20,Did they get enough to make it worth that obscene and absurd apple?
00:39:20,00:39:24,I think a lot of people did not get enough to make it worth a hassle but I think he got
00:39:24,00:39:29,"several million dollars and he moved to Vanuatu, the Pacific Island so yeah but everyone got"
00:39:29,00:39:30,"some money, everyone did win, you know."
00:39:30,00:39:31,"Okay, worth it."
00:39:31,00:39:36,I was just thinking if you did buy all the tickets apart from one then basically your odds
00:39:36,00:39:42,of it being a complete disaster is the same as my odds of winning the lottery if I only buy
00:39:42,00:39:43,"one ticket, isn't it?"
00:39:43,00:39:44,Yeah.
00:39:44,00:39:45,That's true.
00:39:45,00:39:47,I am flukking at things.
00:39:47,00:39:52,It's always showing us the new angle.
00:39:52,00:39:57,"That's the odds of losing the lottery in that case, isn't it?"
00:39:57,00:39:58,Yeah.
00:39:58,00:40:04,"I think about another guy in Melbourne actually, as you said that guy was who won and he sort"
00:40:04,00:40:09,of often appears on articles about you know Lockest Man in the world and that's this guy
00:40:09,00:40:15,"called Bill Morgan who was in the 90s, he had a bad accident actually and this ends happily"
00:40:15,00:40:18,by the way that's why people say he's the Lockest Man in the world before you start getting
00:40:18,00:40:19,upset.
00:40:19,00:40:24,So he had an accident where he ended up dead for 14 minutes.
00:40:24,00:40:25,"Oh right, sorry."
00:40:25,00:40:33,"He genuinely, I thought that was a very short story."
00:40:33,00:40:37,"He ended up dead for 14 minutes like clinically dead but they resuscitated him, he you know"
00:40:37,00:40:42,"and twice, he was in a coma for 12 days, they were advised to turn off his life support"
00:40:42,00:40:46,twice because they were like he's going to be completely brain dead but he woke up completely
00:40:46,00:40:49,"fine, turned up, didn't have any brain damage at all."
00:40:49,00:40:55,"So he proposed to his girlfriend straight away, said yes and to celebrate a bit of a low"
00:40:55,00:41:00,brown way of celebrating but he bought a scratch card and he scratched it off and he'd want
00:41:00,00:41:06,"a car and so he was delighted about this and he, and the local news, very, very local news"
00:41:06,00:41:10,I guess got in touch but I mean it was quite a big story because he'd been in this coma and
00:41:10,00:41:13,he'd suddenly come out and he'd won this car.
00:41:13,00:41:14,So the local news came.
00:41:14,00:41:18,"Did the local news, the local news also accuse him of being low brown for celebrating coming"
00:41:18,00:41:22,out of his coma?
00:41:22,00:41:27,I think what I meant was it was quite an underwhelming way to celebrate buying one scratch
00:41:27,00:41:28,"card, you know?"
00:41:28,00:41:29,Okay.
00:41:29,00:41:34,"Look fine, it's a perfectly decent way to celebrate surviving a coma and getting engaged"
00:41:34,00:41:35,buying a scratch card.
00:41:35,00:41:39,"I know what you mean because it's like if you get engaged there's, it's sort of saying"
00:41:39,00:41:43,I am happy to be with you rather than I wish for a dramatic change in my life circumstances.
00:41:43,00:41:48,"So it's a slightly, there's a bit of side eye to it if you say let's, let's try and change"
00:41:48,00:41:49,everything.
00:41:49,00:41:51,"It's actually a bit of an insult, isn't it?"
00:41:51,00:41:55,"Right now I've doomed my life, let's try and find something that can possibly resuscitate"
00:41:55,00:41:56,it.
00:41:56,00:42:02,"Anyway, this film, local film crew came to film his delight and they asked him to reenact"
00:42:02,00:42:07,the moment that he'd won the car and so they got him to buy another scratch card and
00:42:07,00:42:08,scratch it off to reenact.
00:42:08,00:42:12,"Oh my god, I've won a car and then he looked down at the scratch card and he went, oh my"
00:42:12,00:42:18,"god, I've won $250,000 and they were like, well you got the line wrong mate and there's"
00:42:18,00:42:21,"other scratch card, one of 250 grand."
00:42:21,00:42:22,Wow.
00:42:22,00:42:26,And he immediately dumped his fiancee.
00:42:26,00:42:32,"Okay, it's time for our final fact of the show and that is James."
00:42:32,00:42:37,"Okay, in my fact this week is that Zagreb has a museum of hangovers."
00:42:37,00:42:42,His inventor was inspired when a friend woke up one morning with an unexplained bike pedal
00:42:42,00:42:46,in his pocket.
00:42:46,00:42:53,So this is a guy called a Reno W. Yockovich who was a university student in Zagreb in Croatia
00:42:53,00:42:58,and he said that he told journalists that a friend spoke about how he woke up with a bicycle
00:42:58,00:43:04,"pedal in his pocket and I thought, as I listened to him, why not set up a place and museum with"
00:43:04,00:43:09,a collection of these objects as stories that will illustrate in a funny way these evenings
00:43:09,00:43:12,of drunkenness and the hangover the next day.
00:43:12,00:43:16,"I rather than just thinking it, he actually went and did it and this is the thing that now"
00:43:16,00:43:19,exists in Croatia.
00:43:19,00:43:21,"It's amazing that it's a real place, yeah."
00:43:21,00:43:23,"Yeah, it sounds really cool, doesn't it?"
00:43:23,00:43:28,"The idea of visit when you go inside it, it recreates your drunken journey home so it's"
00:43:28,00:43:33,"room by room, you start in the bar and then you go on to sort of graffiti lined walls"
00:43:33,00:43:38,that emulate a street and then you get to store fronts and then at a guard and finally your
00:43:38,00:43:39,bedroom.
00:43:39,00:43:40,That's the end of the museum.
00:43:40,00:43:45,"Finally, you swallow your house key."
00:43:45,00:43:50,"They have chalkboard in there where it features the beginning of a sentence which is, I woke"
00:43:50,00:43:54,"up with and then you can write in your answers of, you know, the worst thing you've woken"
00:43:54,00:43:59,up with when you've had a hangover and answers in the museum at the moment or when this
00:43:59,00:44:05,"answer was written include two stray dogs, a lot of pumpkins and I saw the girl who wrote"
00:44:05,00:44:11,"this, one eye, now this is very frustrating because I saw there's like a video footage"
00:44:11,00:44:16,of inside the museum and you see this girl write one eye but you only see her in profile
00:44:16,00:44:19,so I couldn't find out if she was lying.
00:44:19,00:44:24,But it could be that you've lost one of your eyes so you've woken up with one eye or that
00:44:24,00:44:27,you've woken up with someone else's eye in addition to your own.
00:44:27,00:44:31,"It's either one or three eyes you've got altogether, isn't it?"
00:44:31,00:44:32,"Yes, exactly."
00:44:32,00:44:33,Yeah.
00:44:33,00:44:34,Which would you prefer?
00:44:34,00:44:35,Oh.
00:44:35,00:44:36,I should think three.
00:44:36,00:44:37,I don't know.
00:44:37,00:44:39,That implies you might have done something awful though.
00:44:39,00:44:40,Does it?
00:44:40,00:44:43,I think that waking up with only one eye implies that something awful has happened.
00:44:43,00:44:46,"No, but I mean, I think it depends if you'd rather harm yourself or someone else James."
00:44:46,00:44:49,"Maybe that's the difference between you and me, you know?"
00:44:49,00:44:53,"Well, one other difference between you and me is I assumed I just found the eye."
00:44:53,00:44:54,I need to.
00:44:54,00:44:56,I've done something awful to someone to get it.
00:44:56,00:44:58,I assume I've gouged it out of a love ride.
00:44:58,00:44:59,I've just seen James.
00:44:59,00:45:03,You're happy with the three eye option yet the three sock option you seem to be very hesitant
00:45:03,00:45:04,to have.
00:45:04,00:45:09,"Well, what I'm thinking is if I've had three more eyes, then I might have to have some eyes."
00:45:09,00:45:12,"But James, that will take longer to match them all up."
00:45:12,00:45:13,Yep.
00:45:13,00:45:14,You're absolutely right.
00:45:14,00:45:16,You've got a big pile of eyes that you have to match with.
00:45:16,00:45:17,Yeah.
00:45:17,00:45:18,Not if they're all the same colours.
00:45:18,00:45:20,"As long as you've got all blue eyes, you're fine, right?"
00:45:20,00:45:21,Yep.
00:45:21,00:45:22,"Yeah, that's true."
00:45:22,00:45:24,"So if you're ever going to be gouging out people's eyes, why don't go for people"
00:45:24,00:45:25,with the same eye colour.
00:45:25,00:45:26,Just a little tip.
00:45:26,00:45:31,Probably an amateur to the professional murderous out there.
00:45:31,00:45:37,I think I would definitely hope for the chance that I had done something horrible over the
00:45:37,00:45:40,guarantee of having lost an eye.
00:45:40,00:45:44,Because I trust my drunken self not to take someone's eye.
00:45:44,00:45:45,Yeah.
00:45:45,00:45:46,And maybe...
00:45:46,00:45:49,You take a gamble and not having removed someone's eye by force rather than the guarantee
00:45:49,00:45:50,of having your own eye.
00:45:50,00:45:56,But that may be an inflated sense of my own generosity and pleasantness when drunk.
00:45:56,00:45:57,"Well, yeah."
00:45:57,00:46:01,"Because you and I went on a big night out, quite recently, Andy."
00:46:01,00:46:02,Didn't we?
00:46:02,00:46:03,We did.
00:46:03,00:46:04,How we were the last two men standing for the end of that night out.
00:46:04,00:46:07,"And James, you've been missing three fingers ever since."
00:46:07,00:46:08,So hangovers.
00:46:08,00:46:09,Yeah.
00:46:09,00:46:10,Mmm.
00:46:10,00:46:11,They're not fun.
00:46:11,00:46:12,How they?
00:46:12,00:46:13,No.
00:46:13,00:46:16,And they're very damaging.
00:46:16,00:46:21,"So on average, 200,000 British workers turn up to work hungover every day."
00:46:21,00:46:25,And I imagine in these days a lockdown more than that.
00:46:25,00:46:30,And there's been a couple of papers that have pointed out it's weird that not more research
00:46:30,00:46:35,has gone into it because it has a massive impact on the economy and on society.
00:46:35,00:46:41,That number of people being quite debilitating the ill on a daily basis is losing the country
00:46:41,00:46:42,a lot of money.
00:46:42,00:46:46,"And I was reading one editorial in the current drug abuse journal, which says it's"
00:46:46,00:46:47,really surprising.
00:46:47,00:46:50,We haven't come up with a cure because of these consequences.
00:46:50,00:46:52,And it speculates that there's probably ethical reasons.
00:46:52,00:46:55,"So people basically think, a hangover is kind of your punishment."
00:46:55,00:46:56,You got drunk.
00:46:56,00:46:59,You can stop getting drunk and then not have hangovers.
00:46:59,00:47:04,But the journal points out that people assume a hangover's punishment that will prevent
00:47:04,00:47:06,similar drinking episodes in future.
00:47:06,00:47:09,"However, there is no scientific evidence that supports this assumption."
00:47:09,00:47:13,"Whereas during the hangover, people often state they will never drink again."
00:47:13,00:47:15,This has never been found to happen.
00:47:15,00:47:16,It's true.
00:47:16,00:47:17,That's true.
00:47:17,00:47:23,"The way I like to look at it is you're kind of borrowing some fun from the next day, right?"
00:47:23,00:47:28,"So if you go out drinking on Friday, then you're borrowing some of Saturday morning's fun"
00:47:28,00:47:30,and having it on Friday night.
00:47:30,00:47:35,"So you have more fun on Friday, but then on Saturday, you just feel like not fun at all,"
00:47:35,00:47:36,right?
00:47:36,00:47:37,That's a really good way of looking.
00:47:37,00:47:39,"Oh my God, that's an amazing way of thinking about it."
00:47:39,00:47:45,But that explains because I'm very keen on deferring gratification as far as possible.
00:47:45,00:47:49,"Which probably explains why I'm not a very big drinker because I think, well, I'd rather"
00:47:49,00:47:54,have no fun at all tonight in the hope of having lots tomorrow.
00:47:54,00:48:00,"Well, what you could do is play the lottery, like a friend of mine does, where he buys lottery"
00:48:00,00:48:06,"ticket and then he doesn't look at it until the next week, until after the next week's"
00:48:06,00:48:08,draw has been made.
00:48:08,00:48:10,And he's already bought next week's lottery ticket.
00:48:10,00:48:15,And what that means is that he always potentially has a winning lottery ticket in his
00:48:15,00:48:16,wallet.
00:48:16,00:48:19,So he's always got a potentially lottery winning ticket on him.
00:48:19,00:48:20,"Yeah, exactly."
00:48:20,00:48:26,Is he a happy man or is he a bit weird?
00:48:26,00:48:27,"Is you, isn't it?"
00:48:27,00:48:28,It's him.
00:48:28,00:48:30,Oh God.
00:48:30,00:48:35,I was reading about a pretty spectacular hangover that happened in China.
00:48:35,00:48:41,"There's a guy called Jiang Wu, who was staying at a bed and breakfast in Qingdao."
00:48:41,00:48:44,He had fallen asleep in what he thought was his bed and breakfast.
00:48:44,00:48:50,It actually turned out to be a shipping container that was being loaded the very next morning
00:48:50,00:48:53,onto a cargo that was going to set sail for Los Angeles.
00:48:53,00:48:57,So he woke up inside the container.
00:48:57,00:48:59,"He luckily had his phone on him, who was called as friends."
00:48:59,00:49:02,He couldn't get through to a bunch of people called the police.
00:49:02,00:49:06,"Eventually, they worked out where he might be by tracking the phone."
00:49:06,00:49:11,And they found him in a stack of cargo containers that were reaching 60 feet high.
00:49:11,00:49:13,And they had to go through.
00:49:13,00:49:17,"I'd log about, and if he'd not, if he'd not work enough, if it'd been a few hours later,"
00:49:17,00:49:21,I think they said he would have been on his way to Los Angeles.
00:49:21,00:49:22,Oh my God.
00:49:22,00:49:24,It's a pretty holiday.
00:49:24,00:49:31,"There's quality of Airbnb's in the city you mentioned, then, must be so low."
00:49:31,00:49:35,Maybe they have extremely luxury shipping containers.
00:49:35,00:49:36,"Yeah, maybe."
00:49:36,00:49:37,Yeah.
00:49:37,00:49:38,No.
00:49:38,00:49:42,"I actually have a favourite hangover that I've, I thought it's my favourite hangover for"
00:49:42,00:49:45,"a long time, and I'm so glad I get to share it."
00:49:45,00:49:46,It's Alexander the Great.
00:49:46,00:49:48,I think he had the best hangover of all time.
00:49:48,00:49:49,OK.
00:49:49,00:49:55,"So this is in 330 BC, and one of his greatest conquests was he conquered Persepolis."
00:49:55,00:49:58,"It was the Persian capital, and they've been building up to it for ages."
00:49:58,00:50:01,"It's this huge, historic moment."
00:50:01,00:50:04,"And it had a magnificent palace, or series of palaces."
00:50:04,00:50:09,And they had hundreds of years' worth of great Persian art and sculpture and writing
00:50:09,00:50:10,and lots of treasure.
00:50:10,00:50:12,It was the proper jewel of the empire.
00:50:12,00:50:16,"So anyway, Alexander the Great storms in with his troops takes over this empire."
00:50:16,00:50:18,"It's the capital, massive moment."
00:50:18,00:50:23,"And then, so according to one account, everyone got really pissed, as you do, celebrating,"
00:50:23,00:50:25,absolutely hammers.
00:50:25,00:50:30,"And apparently, the drinking was far advanced, and Drunken Madness took possession of their"
00:50:30,00:50:31,minds.
00:50:31,00:50:35,"And then, according to various accounts, either Alexander and his assistance decided,"
00:50:35,00:50:40,"or this woman decided, who was one of their mistresses, decided that what they should"
00:50:40,00:50:43,do is they should just burn the whole place down.
00:50:43,00:50:49,"So she said, wouldn't it be really funny if you got us a bunch of women to burn down this"
00:50:49,00:50:52,amazing Persian city that's taken so long to build?
00:50:52,00:50:56,And they giddy with wine decided that would indeed be absolutely hilarious.
00:50:56,00:50:59,And they burnt down the entire place.
00:50:59,00:51:03,And so I just love the added Alexander the Great woke up the next morning in his newly conquered
00:51:03,00:51:04,palace in the city.
00:51:04,00:51:07,"And went, oh my god, what have I done?"
00:51:07,00:51:08,Wow.
00:51:08,00:51:09,And that's it.
00:51:09,00:51:11,"And destroyed the Great, and we'll never have that."
00:51:11,00:51:14,We'll never have the great jewel of that Persian empire.
00:51:14,00:51:19,"They need to make that into a movie, a sort of historical version of the hangover, the movie"
00:51:19,00:51:23,just to see what his 24 hours were opposed to that.
00:51:23,00:51:24,Wow.
00:51:24,00:51:29,The ancient cures are so much fun for hangovers.
00:51:29,00:51:34,So there was a big thing of wearing a wreath of flowers in your hair.
00:51:34,00:51:38,"If you did that while drinking, doctors thought that had curative properties, and that you"
00:51:38,00:51:42,"might not get the hangover the next day, did they have to be specific flowers, do you think?"
00:51:42,00:51:45,"I think they probably would have been because that was a big thing, wasn't it?"
00:51:45,00:51:47,"You know, this will cure this and so on."
00:51:47,00:51:51,But we know that the treatises about this were written.
00:51:51,00:51:55,We just don't know what was in them because we just have references to them.
00:51:55,00:51:58,So we don't know exactly which flowers were for which drinks.
00:51:58,00:52:00,"It's not very helpful, is it?"
00:52:00,00:52:01,I know.
00:52:01,00:52:02,So lovely idea as well.
00:52:02,00:52:05,Everyone just in the pub is wearing a wreath of flowers on their head while they get
00:52:05,00:52:06,battered.
00:52:06,00:52:07,It was quite nice.
00:52:07,00:52:14,"There was being boiled in a coffin and then buried in hay, which is less nice."
00:52:14,00:52:16,This is an alpine tradition.
00:52:16,00:52:20,"I've read about it in this book, which I really want to get full of books, by a guy called"
00:52:20,00:52:22,Shaunasi Bishop's Stool.
00:52:22,00:52:27,"And he's written a book called ""Hungover,"" the morning after, and ""One Man's Quest"" for"
00:52:27,00:52:28,the cure.
00:52:28,00:52:32,And he basically went on this quest of getting drunk every single night in order that he
00:52:32,00:52:33,could test out.
00:52:33,00:52:39,"And he tried this one, which is traditional, where you lie in this wooden coffin in a dark"
00:52:39,00:52:45,"room and you shut in, and then this lady scoops boiling water into it till you're really hot,"
00:52:45,00:52:49,and then you get lifted out and chucked into a massive pile of hay and then covered up
00:52:49,00:52:50,with hay.
00:52:50,00:52:52,And then she digs you out and you're good to go.
00:52:52,00:52:54,"I swear for tries, isn't it?"
00:52:54,00:52:55,Is it for tries?
00:52:55,00:52:57,Does he report what it's like?
00:52:57,00:52:58,Did it work?
00:52:58,00:53:03,"Because he felt sort of euphoric afterwards, but he didn't actually seem to say that it"
00:53:03,00:53:09,"definitely worked, but he did come up with a hangover cure in this book, and I trust this"
00:53:09,00:53:12,"more than anything, because no one's come up with a proper hangover cure, except this guy"
00:53:12,00:53:19,"who said, ""The only solution to the proper hangover symptoms of nausea and headache, basically."""
00:53:19,00:53:22,"So we don't really care about tiredness and stuff, that's just like snap out of it, have"
00:53:22,00:53:23,a coffee.
00:53:23,00:53:28,"But nausea and headache, before you go to sleep, take milk thistle for your liver and"
00:53:28,00:53:33,"then you take an amino acid called enacetylcystine, apparently, which is inhaled as mist."
00:53:33,00:53:35,"I looked it up, you can inhale it as mist, right?"
00:53:35,00:53:39,"Then take vitamins B1, B6 and B12 and some frankincense."
00:53:39,00:53:40,If you do that.
00:53:40,00:53:43,"Well, we're going to get all this stuff."
00:53:43,00:53:48,"I thought you might be growing it in your garden, I think it'd be easier for me to fight"
00:53:48,00:53:52,"a coffin, some hay, you're the Swiss lady."
00:53:52,00:53:53,Yeah.
00:53:53,00:53:57,"Anna, I love the fact that in a time where we cannot buy tomatoes or pasta, you'll"
00:53:57,00:53:58,recommend it.
00:53:58,00:54:00,People go out and get themselves some frankincense.
00:54:00,00:54:07,"If you go to Tesco, the frankincense is completely empty at the moment, but you should be able"
00:54:07,00:54:11,"to inhale it as a mist, so just go and buy a packet of mist and your local shop."
00:54:11,00:54:12,Guys.
00:54:12,00:54:19,"I just, there hasn't been as much of a run on mist as the house been on Exfer Institute."
00:54:19,00:54:26,"Okay, that's it."
00:54:26,00:54:27,That is all of our facts.
