00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:13.940
 *starts playing*

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:19.040
 Hello, and welcome to another Working From Home episode of No Such Thing as a Fish,

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:24.180
 a weekly podcast not coming to you from the QI offices in Covent Garden.

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:28.920
 My name is Dan Schreiber, I am sitting here with Anichezinski, Andrew Hunter Murray, and

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:33.480
 James Harkin, and once again, we have gathered around the microphones with our four favorite

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:39.000
 facts from the last seven days, and in no particular order, here we go.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:40.800
 Starting with you, Anna.

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:46.520
 My fact this week is that when people accidentally swallow coins, they're stomachs, sometimes

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:47.840
 punch holes in them.

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:51.080
 I think this is so cool, and it's quite a new thing.

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:54.080
 I'm not suggesting you should swallow a coin to test it out, but-

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:57.240
 Anna, when you say it's quite a new thing, do you mean in the past when people swallow

00:00:57.240 --> 00:00:59.040
 coins, it's not done that?

00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:00.040
 Yes.

00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:01.040
 Wow.

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:04.680
 So you didn't mean that coins are a relatively recent human invention, and we didn't have

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:07.720
 the capacity to swallow them until 8000 years ago, right?

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:08.720
 I didn't mean that.

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:11.080
 No, people have been swallowing coins since time immemorial.

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:14.000
 It's just that our stomachs have evolved is what you're saying.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.720
 Exactly, in the last 20 years our stomachs have completely changed.

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:22.240
 No, that's not what's happened to either, coins have changed though, so this was a problem

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:27.200
 that was discovered in America in the 90s, and it turned out that copper coins had

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:32.140
 been swapped for copper-covered zinc coins, and if you swallow copper, then your stomach

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:35.680
 acid doesn't really affect it, it can just go through, come out the other end, but if you

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:41.040
 got zinc in there, the stomach acid finds it much easier to chip away at it, and so doctors

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:43.240
 were finding in the 90s, they were x-raying kids.

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:46.560
 They said they had stomach problems, for instance, and they saw these kind of discs with

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:50.120
 lots of holes in them, like really neat holes punched in them, and they didn't really know

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:54.400
 what they were, and turned out they were coins, but made of zinc, and they had the holes

00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:57.440
 punched, and so how cool is that?

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:58.440
 Yeah, it's amazing.

00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:00.080
 How come it doesn't dissolve the entire coin?

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:02.260
 Why is it so neatly just punching holes in it?

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:07.560
 Well, I would guess that the copper that the zinc coins are sometimes covered with can erode

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:10.920
 a bit with use, so I think sometimes bits of copper will have come off on parts of the

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:14.560
 surface, and not on others, and if the acid can get through the copper, it can suddenly

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:18.720
 penetrate through the zinc, so it'll be on the bits of the coin where the copper hasn't

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:19.720
 been eroded.

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:20.720
 That's clever.

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:21.720
 Super clever.

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:26.600
 Isn't there a country where coins have holes in them already?

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:27.600
 I'm sure…

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:28.600
 Yeah, loads of countries.

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:29.600
 Yeah.

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:30.600
 There's a square hole.

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:33.440
 I'm sure there's a country which has either a square or a round hole.

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:35.600
 It's probably one of the two in the middle of it.

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:36.600
 Yeah.

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:37.600
 I can't remember which country that is really annoying.

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:41.200
 Well, the way they manufacture those is they get someone at the Royal Mint to swallow

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:42.200
 every single coin.

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:44.440
 It's a very hard choice of process.

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:47.200
 It's very hard to retrieve them at the end, though, isn't it?

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:52.160
 It's not all dogs like the worst fruit machine ever, the money comes out at the end, but

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:53.920
 you're not really excited by it.

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:54.920
 Yeah.

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:59.200
 You are getting, though, a square hole out of a round hole at the end of it.

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:00.200
 Yeah.

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:01.200
 Oh, that's cool.

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:02.200
 Yeah.

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:03.200
 They do it in…

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:04.200
 Oh, sorry.

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:05.200
 Have you seen that?

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:09.040
 I think Wikipedia's Twitter feed tweeted it this weekend.

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:10.040
 Have you seen it?

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:11.600
 It's like a Tyler in Japan.

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:12.920
 Is it in Japan?

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:16.080
 Where it can recognise you by your anus.

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:17.080
 Yeah.

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:18.080
 Oh, yeah.

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:19.840
 Isn't it amazing?

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:21.120
 What an amazing bit of technology.

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:22.120
 You like James?

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:23.120
 You sit there.

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:26.760
 Well, I'm back.

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:32.840
 And it's just all the cameras can look at your anus and just say, "Oh, that's you, James."

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:33.840
 What possible need is that?

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:39.920
 If you hear next door in a public toilet, if you hear a toilet going, "Oh, no, no, no,

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:40.920
 you again."

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:45.040
 That's the next thing when they were consenting, isn't it?

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:47.000
 Is it useful for…

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:48.000
 What is it useful for?

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:50.520
 Is it so that if you've got lots of people in the house and you're trying to monitor your

00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:53.520
 health, but you don't want to get confused between…

00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:54.520
 I think it is like that.

00:03:54.520 --> 00:03:59.720
 It's like, you know, having a Fitbit on your wrist and it can tell, like, what's wrong

00:03:59.720 --> 00:04:00.720
 with you.

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:04.840
 But the thing is with the toilet, you can't really carry it around with you, so it needs

00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:05.840
 to…

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:06.840
 And lots of people use it.

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:09.840
 So it kind of needs to know who's using it at any one time.

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:14.360
 So it can look at your VCs and decides what's wrong with you, maybe?

00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:19.480
 Maybe for crimes they could use it as, you know, anal recognition, you know, we might be

00:04:19.480 --> 00:04:20.480
 able to bust criminals by…

00:04:20.480 --> 00:04:28.920
 Well, it would save a lot of very embarrassing police line-ups, wouldn't it?

00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:30.800
 They should call this thing a Fitbit.

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:31.800
 That's what they should call it.

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:32.800
 They've got to do that.

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:33.800
 They've got to do that.

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:37.640
 Anyway, so that's what we've got to say about coins, I guess.

00:04:37.640 --> 00:04:42.600
 Well, I just wanted to say, the fact that Sink reacts with your stomach acid is quite

00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:44.200
 an interesting thing.

00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:50.760
 So in 2015, they invented this new technology, it's like you kind of take a pill and the pill

00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:55.520
 has like a tiny motor in it and the motor is activated.

00:04:55.520 --> 00:04:58.680
 It's made out of zinc and it's activated by your stomach acid.

00:04:58.680 --> 00:05:03.600
 So the zinc reacts with your stomach acid and generates like hydrogen bubbles and then

00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:08.800
 those bubbles mean that it can act like a torpedo and it fires through your stomach so

00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:13.400
 that it gets into your stomach wall and it can kind of lodge there and it can put stuff

00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:14.400
 into your bloodstream.

00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:15.400
 Oh wow.

00:05:15.400 --> 00:05:16.400
 Isn't that amazing?

00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:17.400
 Wow.

00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:18.400
 Awesome.

00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:22.560
 So it's a motor that's only activated when it reacts, when the Sink reacts with the…

00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:23.560
 Exactly.

00:05:23.560 --> 00:05:24.560
 Hydrogen, didn't you say?

00:05:24.560 --> 00:05:28.560
 It's Sink reacting with hydrochloric acid creating hydrogen bubbles.

00:05:28.560 --> 00:05:29.560
 That's so clever.

00:05:29.560 --> 00:05:30.560
 Genius.

00:05:30.560 --> 00:05:35.840
 And that, isn't that what the Alanis Morissette album Jagged Little Pill is about?

00:05:35.840 --> 00:05:36.840
 That is.

00:05:36.840 --> 00:05:41.200
 It's weird though because this technology was only invented in 2015 but that album came

00:05:41.200 --> 00:05:43.360
 out in the '90s or something.

00:05:43.360 --> 00:05:45.080
 He's got real foresight though.

00:05:45.080 --> 00:05:46.080
 Yeah.

00:05:46.080 --> 00:05:47.080
 She accidentally didn't patent the invention.

00:05:47.080 --> 00:05:48.080
 She released it as lyrics.

00:05:48.080 --> 00:05:49.080
 Oh, I'm sorry.

00:05:49.080 --> 00:05:50.080
 How ironic.

00:05:50.080 --> 00:05:51.080
 How ironic.

00:05:51.080 --> 00:05:56.240
 Have you got any more on this, Anna?

00:05:56.240 --> 00:06:00.200
 Just quickly to share some advice, please be advised number one is just don't swallow

00:06:00.200 --> 00:06:03.840
 coins just because you want to be able to thread them on a string or whatever.

00:06:03.840 --> 00:06:06.680
 And when I say accidentally, I guess I'm talking about children.

00:06:06.680 --> 00:06:08.040
 It's mostly them who swallow coins.

00:06:08.040 --> 00:06:11.080
 So maybe they're doing it on purpose but they don't know why.

00:06:11.080 --> 00:06:15.720
 But the current medical advice is to doctors, if you're looking at an x-ray and you see

00:06:15.720 --> 00:06:20.520
 some coins in a stomach, is that if it's just a coin that's sort of intact, you can just

00:06:20.520 --> 00:06:23.600
 leave it, send the patient home and it'll probably pass.

00:06:23.600 --> 00:06:28.160
 But if it's a coin with scalloped edges or holes in it, then you should endoscopically

00:06:28.160 --> 00:06:32.400
 remove it because that implies it's been there for a bit too long and it's decided to

00:06:32.400 --> 00:06:33.400
 sort of bed down.

00:06:33.400 --> 00:06:34.400
 Oh.

00:06:34.400 --> 00:06:38.600
 That should be a medical advice out there from an amateur to the experts.

00:06:38.600 --> 00:06:43.240
 An enthusiastic colour should though, Anna, the right, certainly.

00:06:43.240 --> 00:06:45.640
 But stomach acid is amazing, isn't it?

00:06:45.640 --> 00:06:47.200
 The power of stomach acid.

00:06:47.200 --> 00:06:50.120
 If you swallow razor blades, again, don't do it because they'll slit your throat on

00:06:50.120 --> 00:06:53.960
 the way down, but if you do and survive it, your stomach acid can just break them right

00:06:53.960 --> 00:06:54.960
 down.

00:06:54.960 --> 00:06:55.960
 Wow.

00:06:55.960 --> 00:06:56.960
 Incredible.

00:06:56.960 --> 00:06:57.960
 Is more acidic than battery acid.

00:06:57.960 --> 00:06:58.960
 That is amazing.

00:06:58.960 --> 00:06:59.960
 Wow.

00:06:59.960 --> 00:07:05.160
 So crocodiles, they can secrete stomach acid 10 times faster than any other animals, which

00:07:05.160 --> 00:07:06.160
 is this amazing.

00:07:06.160 --> 00:07:09.760
 I mean, when you think about that, that's nuts.

00:07:09.760 --> 00:07:13.680
 And it's because they do it because they have these massive meals every so often and they

00:07:13.680 --> 00:07:15.400
 need to break them down.

00:07:15.400 --> 00:07:20.280
 And they have, instead of, you know, we've got an aorta blood vessel in our bodies.

00:07:20.280 --> 00:07:25.000
 They've got two, one of which supplies the heart, but one of which is a special one which

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:26.400
 goes to the stomach.

00:07:26.400 --> 00:07:31.560
 And when they eat, the brain, the crocodile's brain signals the heart and it says, don't

00:07:31.560 --> 00:07:37.200
 send any blood to the lungs, just pump it all to the stomach via the special super highway.

00:07:37.200 --> 00:07:40.760
 And then there's carbon, lots of carbon dioxide builds up in their blood because none of their

00:07:40.760 --> 00:07:42.160
 blood is going to the lungs.

00:07:42.160 --> 00:07:44.920
 So the carbon dioxide is not getting out of their bloodstream.

00:07:44.920 --> 00:07:50.320
 But what that means is that the stomach takes that blood, which is full of carbon dioxide

00:07:50.320 --> 00:07:53.560
 and it pulls the carbon dioxide out to create more acid.

00:07:53.560 --> 00:07:55.200
 So that's how they make it.

00:07:55.200 --> 00:07:59.440
 And they can digest gazelle horns and hooves and they just eat anything and it can just

00:07:59.440 --> 00:08:00.440
 be broken down.

00:08:00.440 --> 00:08:02.000
 It's because they've got this magic method of making it.

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:03.000
 That's incredible.

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:04.000
 That's so cool.

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:07.560
 So it's like dual purpose because the vessel is, first of all, going to the stomach to help

00:08:07.560 --> 00:08:11.640
 it out, but also the increased carbon content of the blood can then be used.

00:08:11.640 --> 00:08:12.640
 Yeah.

00:08:12.640 --> 00:08:13.640
 They're very clever on it.

00:08:13.640 --> 00:08:14.640
 That's amazing.

00:08:14.640 --> 00:08:19.760
 Do you know stomach acid is the reason that when you do a number two, it can sting, because

00:08:19.760 --> 00:08:22.480
 yeah, I thought that was really interesting.

00:08:22.480 --> 00:08:26.080
 So it doesn't, it doesn't eat away at your stomach lining because we've got a very

00:08:26.080 --> 00:08:28.800
 protective layer of mucus in our stomach lining.

00:08:28.800 --> 00:08:34.960
 But if you've got a particularly bad lump of turd, then and it comes out and it really

00:08:34.960 --> 00:08:41.240
 breathes because it's just so polite for number two, and then you're like, okay, now what's

00:08:41.240 --> 00:08:42.920
 another polite sitting in for that?

00:08:42.920 --> 00:08:43.920
 I forgot all the words.

00:08:43.920 --> 00:08:45.680
 I forgot all the other words.

00:08:45.680 --> 00:08:47.320
 A lump of turd.

00:08:47.320 --> 00:08:48.680
 A fecal mouser.

00:08:48.680 --> 00:08:53.640
 Then there's a little bit of stomach acid still left on the outside of it and your rectum

00:08:53.640 --> 00:08:55.120
 isn't protected from it.

00:08:55.120 --> 00:08:57.440
 Is that right?

00:08:57.440 --> 00:09:00.240
 That's not in all cases where it stings, so is it?

00:09:00.240 --> 00:09:02.680
 If you have a curry, that might be due to the chilies or something.

00:09:02.680 --> 00:09:05.120
 I think that is also due to chilies, probably, yeah.

00:09:05.120 --> 00:09:08.560
 So that's a potent combination of stomach acid and the chili, I guess.

00:09:08.560 --> 00:09:09.560
 Gosh.

00:09:09.560 --> 00:09:12.200
 That would be a painful stool.

00:09:12.200 --> 00:09:13.200
 Yeah.

00:09:13.200 --> 00:09:19.480
 So there's the word you should have used at a stool, that's a classy, classy way of telling

00:09:19.480 --> 00:09:20.480
 it.

00:09:20.480 --> 00:09:26.320
 Well, penguins, king penguins specifically, they are like the reverse of crocodiles.

00:09:26.320 --> 00:09:31.280
 It was a crocodile thing, I said just now.

00:09:31.280 --> 00:09:36.480
 So king penguins can basically turn themselves into a fridge, their own stomach on the inside.

00:09:36.480 --> 00:09:41.600
 They can turn it into a larder because they sometimes have to provide an emergency meal

00:09:41.600 --> 00:09:47.960
 for their chicks, and they, as a result, don't want to digest any of their food.

00:09:47.960 --> 00:09:53.520
 And so they stop producing stomach acid, basically, and that means that the food just, and then

00:09:53.520 --> 00:09:58.280
 they just have these fish in their guts for up to three weeks on end, which they can then

00:09:58.280 --> 00:10:01.680
 regurgitate undigested, that's how they do it.

00:10:01.680 --> 00:10:02.680
 Isn't that mental?

00:10:02.680 --> 00:10:03.680
 Wow.

00:10:03.680 --> 00:10:04.680
 Amazing.

00:10:04.680 --> 00:10:05.680
 Wow.

00:10:05.680 --> 00:10:07.560
 And do they, do they keep it at sort of refrigerate a temperature, do we know?

00:10:07.560 --> 00:10:09.560
 Because otherwise, we're going to be quiet.

00:10:09.560 --> 00:10:10.560
 Quite rotten.

00:10:10.560 --> 00:10:15.680
 I think if you're a penguin, everything, everything's a refrigerated cell, you're right.

00:10:15.680 --> 00:10:16.680
 You're right.

00:10:16.680 --> 00:10:21.640
 And they do, Anna, they do kind of have antibacterial chemicals, which they can secrete inside themselves

00:10:21.640 --> 00:10:22.960
 to preserve the food.

00:10:22.960 --> 00:10:24.560
 So that's how they stop it rotting.

00:10:24.560 --> 00:10:25.560
 Wow.

00:10:25.560 --> 00:10:26.560
 Yeah.

00:10:26.560 --> 00:10:29.760
 So if you're fridge, you know, you lose power in your fridge, but you've got a penguin

00:10:29.760 --> 00:10:30.760
 lying around.

00:10:30.760 --> 00:10:32.760
 You can store your thing in there.

00:10:32.760 --> 00:10:33.760
 Yeah.

00:10:33.760 --> 00:10:34.760
 Great.

00:10:34.760 --> 00:10:40.240
 Um, my favorite stupid swallower, I think, is Chris Foster.

00:10:40.240 --> 00:10:45.760
 Chris Foster from Bournemouth University, who in 2008 was out on a night out with his

00:10:45.760 --> 00:10:51.120
 friends, who decided that he was too drunk, so tried to take him home to his room and to stop

00:10:51.120 --> 00:10:52.120
 them from doing this.

00:10:52.120 --> 00:10:57.240
 He swallowed his room key and he had no memory of this, but woke up the next morning and

00:10:57.240 --> 00:11:00.080
 his friends were all like, mate, you swallowed your room key last night.

00:11:00.080 --> 00:11:01.080
 What you can do about it.

00:11:01.080 --> 00:11:04.120
 And apparently, I like the detail that apparently one of his friends tried the Heimlich maneuver

00:11:04.120 --> 00:11:05.120
 on him.

00:11:05.120 --> 00:11:09.760
 Because you can really imagine the drunken 12 people that someone Heimlich him, just sort

00:11:09.760 --> 00:11:12.000
 of practically crushing him.

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:15.240
 So yeah, he went to your hospital and said, I think I swallowed my key last night.

00:11:15.240 --> 00:11:21.680
 And indeed, he had, and he was sent home and passed the key 31 hours later and put it back

00:11:21.680 --> 00:11:22.680
 on the fob.

00:11:22.680 --> 00:11:23.680
 Wow.

00:11:23.680 --> 00:11:25.440
 A happy ending.

00:11:25.440 --> 00:11:29.920
 And actually, it would have a slightly bigger hole in the key, so it would be easier to get

00:11:29.920 --> 00:11:30.920
 it on his phone.

00:11:30.920 --> 00:11:31.920
 Absolutely.

00:11:31.920 --> 00:11:32.920
 That's why he did it.

00:11:32.920 --> 00:11:35.160
 It's very clear thinking drunkenness.

00:11:35.160 --> 00:11:40.520
 My favorite swallower, sorry, we seem to be playing a game of my favorite swallower,

00:11:40.520 --> 00:11:43.720
 would probably be a guy from the 19th century.

00:11:43.720 --> 00:11:45.600
 Have you heard of the human ostrich?

00:11:45.600 --> 00:11:46.600
 No.

00:11:46.600 --> 00:11:48.920
 I haven't heard of the human ostrich.

00:11:48.920 --> 00:11:50.920
 This was a thing.

00:11:50.920 --> 00:11:53.400
 And in fact, it's not even just one person.

00:11:53.400 --> 00:11:57.760
 There were loads of actors whose standard thing was the human ostrich, where their trick

00:11:57.760 --> 00:12:00.240
 was just swallowing cutlery or glass.

00:12:00.240 --> 00:12:05.800
 And they were kind of an adjunct to the sword swallowing fraternity.

00:12:05.800 --> 00:12:06.800
 And that was just what they did.

00:12:06.800 --> 00:12:11.040
 So there was a guy called Alfonso, who would eat glass and cork and cotton and wool.

00:12:11.040 --> 00:12:14.880
 And it sounds more like sort of a swallowing apprentice's or interns.

00:12:14.880 --> 00:12:18.680
 You know, you start off with a teaspoon, up to a dessert spoon.

00:12:18.680 --> 00:12:22.960
 That is how you learn to swallow a swallowing sort, though, not with a teaspoon, first.

00:12:22.960 --> 00:12:23.960
 Well.

00:12:23.960 --> 00:12:25.680
 That would be something a bit bigger than that.

00:12:25.680 --> 00:12:30.640
 It's really, so I've been reading the files of the SSAI, which is the Swallow's Association

00:12:30.640 --> 00:12:35.720
 International, and they were surveyed about their work.

00:12:35.720 --> 00:12:39.480
 And there were 46 of them who got surveyed, because there are only 100 or 200 people

00:12:39.480 --> 00:12:41.280
 in the world who do this for a living.

00:12:41.280 --> 00:12:48.120
 And the 46 people between them had swallowed 2,000 swords over the previous three months.

00:12:48.120 --> 00:12:50.200
 Half of them had swallowed more than one sword.

00:12:50.200 --> 00:12:56.400
 Five of them had swallowed 10 swords at a time, and one person had swallowed 16 swords simultaneously.

00:12:56.400 --> 00:12:57.400
 Simultaneously.

00:12:57.400 --> 00:12:58.400
 Simultaneously.

00:12:58.400 --> 00:12:59.400
 Simultaneously, I know.

00:12:59.400 --> 00:13:00.400
 I know.

00:13:00.400 --> 00:13:03.080
 And they all got asked about, you know, their tips and tricks.

00:13:03.080 --> 00:13:06.200
 And it was a study in the British Medical Journal that they were surveyed for.

00:13:06.200 --> 00:13:12.640
 So it was trying to work out what injures them, and it turns out it's stubbed toes, actually.

00:13:12.640 --> 00:13:16.680
 I was just thinking, right, you don't see swords much these days, do you?

00:13:16.680 --> 00:13:21.240
 I mean, people don't use swords much for their original purpose.

00:13:21.240 --> 00:13:27.480
 So I just wondered, if you're a sword manufacturer, what percentage of them get swallowed, come

00:13:27.480 --> 00:13:28.480
 to you.

00:13:28.480 --> 00:13:34.480
 Are you tempted as a sword manufacturer to just start rounding off the edges to make it

00:13:34.480 --> 00:13:36.000
 slightly easier for these guys?

00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:37.000
 Yeah.

00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:38.000
 That's exactly what I'm thinking.

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:40.600
 If you're a sword manufacturer, you might as well go for where they're back then.

00:13:40.600 --> 00:13:41.600
 Yeah.

00:13:41.600 --> 00:13:42.600
 What?

00:13:42.600 --> 00:13:43.600
 Make them taste nice, maybe.

00:13:43.600 --> 00:13:44.600
 Yes.

00:13:44.600 --> 00:13:45.600
 Like a flavoured condom.

00:13:45.600 --> 00:13:46.600
 But with a sword.

00:13:46.600 --> 00:13:47.600
 Well, they have a sheath.

00:13:47.600 --> 00:13:48.600
 Don't they?

00:13:48.600 --> 00:13:49.600
 So, they do.

00:13:49.600 --> 00:13:51.600
 But the person is the sheath.

00:13:51.600 --> 00:13:52.600
 Yes.

00:13:52.600 --> 00:13:53.600
 That's interesting.

00:13:53.600 --> 00:13:59.600
 The aim, they said, is to become a living scabbard for the sword.

00:13:59.600 --> 00:14:00.600
 That's not right.

00:14:00.600 --> 00:14:01.600
 Yeah.

00:14:01.600 --> 00:14:05.440
 And because the aim, really, I mean, when you're swallowing a sword, the aim is not to swallow.

00:14:05.440 --> 00:14:07.960
 Swallowing contracts all the muscles all the way down.

00:14:07.960 --> 00:14:09.760
 This is a disastrous thing to do.

00:14:09.760 --> 00:14:10.960
 So, misnomer, isn't it, really?

00:14:10.960 --> 00:14:11.960
 It really is.

00:14:11.960 --> 00:14:12.960
 Yeah.

00:14:12.960 --> 00:14:14.960
 So, we should call them living scabbards, I think.

00:14:14.960 --> 00:14:19.000
 And that's actually what the wealthiest knights in Medieval times used to have, isn't it?

00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:24.400
 One of their servants would be there at their hip.

00:14:24.400 --> 00:14:29.880
 And it's the wealthier of the knight, you are, the more swords your living scabbard can accommodate.

00:14:29.880 --> 00:14:31.600
 So, it's like choosing a golfer.

00:14:31.600 --> 00:14:32.600
 Yeah.

00:14:32.600 --> 00:14:33.600
 Yeah.

00:14:33.600 --> 00:14:38.440
 Anna, when you sent us this fact, you sent us a link to new scientist, I think, which

00:14:38.440 --> 00:14:42.000
 was your evidence for it.

00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:45.680
 And so, I went on to new scientists to search for swallowing.

00:14:45.680 --> 00:14:49.000
 And actually, I found some stuff about sword swallowing as well.

00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:53.280
 So, there is a book that they talked about, which sounds amazing.

00:14:53.280 --> 00:14:54.640
 I'm definitely going to buy it.

00:14:54.640 --> 00:15:01.120
 It's called Memoirs of a Sword Swallower by Dan Mannix, and it was published in 1951.

00:15:01.120 --> 00:15:02.920
 And it talks about all sorts of things.

00:15:02.920 --> 00:15:10.400
 But one of them is that people used to swallow giant corkscrews, so, I know, right, so this

00:15:10.400 --> 00:15:11.400
 is amazing.

00:15:11.400 --> 00:15:15.760
 The way that you do it is you put the corkscrew down into your throat, and you're kind of twisting

00:15:15.760 --> 00:15:16.760
 it round.

00:15:16.760 --> 00:15:20.920
 And as you're doing it, you're making your pharynx, which is like the bit of your throat

00:15:20.920 --> 00:15:21.920
 behind your mouth.

00:15:21.920 --> 00:15:25.800
 You're making it kind of jump up and down with a muscle, and then you twist it, and then

00:15:25.800 --> 00:15:28.800
 you make it jump again, and then you twist it, and then you make it jump again.

00:15:28.800 --> 00:15:31.640
 And you can get the whole corkscrew down your throat.

00:15:31.640 --> 00:15:32.640
 Isn't that amazing?

00:15:32.640 --> 00:15:34.640
 That's the step of art, isn't it?

00:15:34.640 --> 00:15:35.960
 The step of sword swallowing.

00:15:35.960 --> 00:15:42.000
 And, do you know what they could also swallow is a duck's penis, could you say?

00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:44.000
 Yes, they could.

00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:46.000
 What did they want it?

00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:50.920
 What in the cabaret act that would be?

00:15:50.920 --> 00:15:53.440
 What an excuse when your life comes home.

00:15:53.440 --> 00:15:57.200
 I'm a living scabbard.

00:15:57.200 --> 00:16:01.520
 Do you know what I think a lot of wives, if they came home and find their heart,

00:16:01.520 --> 00:16:05.080
 they had been doing that, and they said, "I'm going to start a career as a giant corkscrew

00:16:05.080 --> 00:16:06.080
 swallower."

00:16:06.080 --> 00:16:10.240
 They would wish that they'd just been forlating the duck.

00:16:10.240 --> 00:16:14.840
 I'll be my position.

00:16:14.840 --> 00:16:21.440
 Okay, it is time for fact number two, and that is Andy.

00:16:21.440 --> 00:16:26.600
 My fact is that soldiers in the Russian army weren't issued socks until 2007.

00:16:26.600 --> 00:16:27.600
 Wow.

00:16:27.600 --> 00:16:28.600
 Wow.

00:16:28.600 --> 00:16:29.600
 Wow.

00:16:29.600 --> 00:16:33.280
 Well, they didn't go around the world fighting barefoot, did they?

00:16:33.280 --> 00:16:35.880
 They didn't get... no, no, they're not hippies.

00:16:35.880 --> 00:16:39.880
 They're the opposite of hippies in the Russian army, they're very, very tough people.

00:16:39.880 --> 00:16:44.840
 But they didn't have the socks that we know and love today.

00:16:44.840 --> 00:16:48.720
 Was it a case of bringing your own socks kind of thing?

00:16:48.720 --> 00:16:49.720
 No.

00:16:49.720 --> 00:16:54.560
 They were issued with footwear for between the shoe and the foot, but the thing that the

00:16:54.560 --> 00:17:00.240
 Russian army wore for centuries, actually, were these squares of cloth called Port Yankee.

00:17:00.240 --> 00:17:02.160
 I hope I'm pronouncing that right.

00:17:02.160 --> 00:17:07.800
 They had cotton ones for the summer and warmer, flannel ones for the winter, and they came

00:17:07.800 --> 00:17:13.280
 in a square and you had to do this little elaborate dance of wrapping them around your foot.

00:17:13.280 --> 00:17:15.240
 But the thing is, they had lots of advantages.

00:17:15.240 --> 00:17:19.400
 So they were cheap to make, they were very easy to wash and dry and mend, and if you've

00:17:19.400 --> 00:17:23.520
 got a hole in it, it didn't matter, because there were several layers to them, so one

00:17:23.520 --> 00:17:26.840
 hole, you know, is not a problem.

00:17:26.840 --> 00:17:28.760
 So there were lots of advantages.

00:17:28.760 --> 00:17:29.760
 Yeah.

00:17:29.760 --> 00:17:35.520
 So I asked my father-in-law, who was in the Russian army, actually, about these, and he said,

00:17:35.520 --> 00:17:41.000
 yeah, they're pretty good, actually, because one thing is the boots they would give you were

00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:43.200
 extremely un-flexible.

00:17:43.200 --> 00:17:47.600
 So let's say they probably wouldn't fit exactly the shape of your foot.

00:17:47.600 --> 00:17:52.200
 In fact, they almost certainly wouldn't, but what you could do with these wraps is you

00:17:52.200 --> 00:17:56.680
 could kind of stuff a little bit here, stuff a little bit there, kind of do it on two layers

00:17:56.680 --> 00:18:01.080
 here and on one layer there, so it would make your foot fit exactly in the size of your

00:18:01.080 --> 00:18:02.080
 boot.

00:18:02.080 --> 00:18:06.440
 They could turn your foot into whatever size and shape you'd need it to be.

00:18:06.440 --> 00:18:07.440
 Yeah.

00:18:07.440 --> 00:18:08.440
 Pretty much, yeah, exactly.

00:18:08.440 --> 00:18:13.240
 I watched a video online of someone wrapping their foot up with one of these, and the process

00:18:13.240 --> 00:18:14.240
 was very intricate.

00:18:14.240 --> 00:18:17.480
 It was like swaddling a baby.

00:18:17.480 --> 00:18:21.280
 You have to really tuck it under bits and make sure it flips over this other bit.

00:18:21.280 --> 00:18:24.720
 So they're wearing a bag over their foot, really, an elaborate bag over their foot, rather

00:18:24.720 --> 00:18:25.720
 than a fitted sock?

00:18:25.720 --> 00:18:26.720
 Yeah.

00:18:26.720 --> 00:18:29.160
 I mean, what is a sock, but a bag?

00:18:29.160 --> 00:18:30.160
 But a footbag?

00:18:30.160 --> 00:18:31.160
 That's true.

00:18:31.160 --> 00:18:34.560
 A sock is more of a bag than these squares of cloth, actually.

00:18:34.560 --> 00:18:35.560
 In a sense.

00:18:35.560 --> 00:18:41.360
 I suppose because it's comfortably fitted to one's foot, it feels less baggy, but yeah.

00:18:41.360 --> 00:18:43.680
 But socks are really important, if you're in the army, right?

00:18:43.680 --> 00:18:44.760
 They're super important.

00:18:44.760 --> 00:18:45.760
 Yeah.

00:18:45.760 --> 00:18:50.480
 So in the world where one, for instance, they needed socks for their troops.

00:18:50.480 --> 00:18:56.080
 And so they got people to knit them, because in those days, the way you made socks was by

00:18:56.080 --> 00:18:57.080
 knitting them.

00:18:57.080 --> 00:19:00.360
 You didn't have the big manufacturing processes that you have today.

00:19:00.360 --> 00:19:05.160
 And the problem with people knitting socks is not everyone is particularly good at knitting.

00:19:05.160 --> 00:19:06.160
 Oh, God.

00:19:06.160 --> 00:19:09.560
 I would pity the soldier who had to deal with one of my socks.

00:19:09.560 --> 00:19:12.600
 It would be hell, you'd go barefoot.

00:19:12.600 --> 00:19:19.040
 So for instance, there was one army, one person in the army who wrote a poem, and it said,

00:19:19.040 --> 00:19:22.080
 "Thank you, kind lady, your socks are some fit.

00:19:22.080 --> 00:19:25.280
 I used one for a hammock, and one for a mitt."

00:19:25.280 --> 00:19:26.280
 No.

00:19:26.280 --> 00:19:28.880
 Very good.

00:19:28.880 --> 00:19:32.360
 I thought he was going to finish saying one for my shit.

00:19:32.360 --> 00:19:33.880
 I thought that was going to be there.

00:19:33.880 --> 00:19:36.160
 And that's why you're not the poet laureate.

00:19:36.160 --> 00:19:37.160
 I know.

00:19:37.160 --> 00:19:41.720
 We should never have submitted that rhyme to you when they asked.

00:19:41.720 --> 00:19:44.920
 It's so hard to define sock when you start researching it, isn't it?

00:19:44.920 --> 00:19:48.520
 It's like, they've sort of existed forever, all they've only existed for a hundred

00:19:48.520 --> 00:19:50.280
 years depending on how you do it.

00:19:50.280 --> 00:19:53.800
 So, I love this sort of variety.

00:19:53.800 --> 00:19:57.400
 And I found that, as I was really trying to get to grips with the history of them, they've

00:19:57.400 --> 00:20:02.840
 climbed up and down the leg like nobody's business over the last two thousand years.

00:20:02.840 --> 00:20:03.840
 It's so weird.

00:20:03.840 --> 00:20:08.040
 So you've got like, I think the oldest sock is from about two thousand years ago.

00:20:08.040 --> 00:20:12.280
 And it kind of looks like our socks today, except it has, it was for a sandal.

00:20:12.280 --> 00:20:16.600
 And so it's like those socks that have a different bit for each of the toes.

00:20:16.600 --> 00:20:20.080
 Like it has one bit for the big toe and then a separate bit for the rest of the foot.

00:20:20.080 --> 00:20:25.040
 But then they sort of climbed up the leg gradually so they'd get longer and men were wearing

00:20:25.040 --> 00:20:28.480
 breaches when it got to about 14th, 15th century.

00:20:28.480 --> 00:20:32.240
 So their trousers as it were will get shorter and shorter.

00:20:32.240 --> 00:20:39.160
 And then eventually it got to a time in the 1400s where socks had turned into tights that

00:20:39.160 --> 00:20:43.960
 basically revealed the arse and your tunic or your breaches have become a jacket.

00:20:43.960 --> 00:20:48.680
 And there were all these laws about who was allowed to show their bum and who wore it.

00:20:48.680 --> 00:20:52.080
 The sock was basically the full leg covering by that point.

00:20:52.080 --> 00:20:55.400
 And then they sort of descended again and got lower and lower until we have what we have

00:20:55.400 --> 00:20:57.720
 today, which is the short sock and trousers.

00:20:57.720 --> 00:20:59.720
 So they're just up and down all the time.

00:20:59.720 --> 00:21:04.720
 Do you know what that, that sounds like the progress of the Korean war up and down the

00:21:04.720 --> 00:21:05.720
 Korean peninsula?

00:21:05.720 --> 00:21:06.720
 Do you remember?

00:21:06.720 --> 00:21:10.320
 Because originally the North had made its way almost to the complete South of Ireland.

00:21:10.320 --> 00:21:13.920
 And then there was a huge troop surge and they got pushed back almost to China.

00:21:13.920 --> 00:21:15.200
 And then it stabilized around it.

00:21:15.200 --> 00:21:16.680
 Is it the 38th parallel?

00:21:16.680 --> 00:21:17.680
 That's where they kind of came to the--

00:21:17.680 --> 00:21:18.680
 The 38th parallel?

00:21:18.680 --> 00:21:19.680
 Yeah.

00:21:19.680 --> 00:21:23.120
 So maybe our socks will eventually stop at that parallel on our leg, which I guess would

00:21:23.120 --> 00:21:24.120
 be the knee.

00:21:24.120 --> 00:21:30.520
 Yeah, that's the parallel I'm trying to draw, and it's a parallel I regret drawing increasingly.

00:21:30.520 --> 00:21:32.120
 People used to be killed by their socks.

00:21:32.120 --> 00:21:34.360
 In the 19th century they were a real hazard.

00:21:34.360 --> 00:21:36.120
 There were lots of warnings about them.

00:21:36.120 --> 00:21:39.360
 This was in the age when dyes were quite dangerous.

00:21:39.360 --> 00:21:41.120
 They weren't dyes were deadly.

00:21:41.120 --> 00:21:44.480
 And people used to complain constantly that certain types of socks, particularly the brightly

00:21:44.480 --> 00:21:48.320
 coloured ones, would leave them with these massive ulcers or swollen feet that they couldn't

00:21:48.320 --> 00:21:53.360
 get in and out of their boots and sort of pussy soles, and people would get infections

00:21:53.360 --> 00:21:55.160
 from them and die.

00:21:55.160 --> 00:21:59.520
 And it got to the stage where in about the 1850s men were recommended to only wear white

00:21:59.520 --> 00:22:03.440
 socks because if you had socks that had been dyed by certain types of dye, like a lot

00:22:03.440 --> 00:22:08.800
 of them contained arsenic, which was an ideal, then you were risking your very life.

00:22:08.800 --> 00:22:09.800
 Wow.

00:22:09.800 --> 00:22:10.800
 In fact, the telegraphs--

00:22:10.800 --> 00:22:15.000
 The socks get dyed and then you get dyed.

00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:21.600
 Again, another reason why you're not poor at loriate, we're just coming up with a lot, aren't we?

00:22:21.600 --> 00:22:23.680
 But did they didn't actually kill anyone, did they?

00:22:23.680 --> 00:22:26.840
 And I don't think there were any recorded deaths where the cause of death was put on the

00:22:26.840 --> 00:22:27.840
 former's socks.

00:22:27.840 --> 00:22:32.160
 I didn't find the death certificates, but there were certainly journalists who said that

00:22:32.160 --> 00:22:33.640
 they'd been killing people.

00:22:33.640 --> 00:22:37.480
 And you can imagine with infections, people weren't very good at staving off, you know.

00:22:37.480 --> 00:22:38.480
 I guess, yeah.

00:22:38.480 --> 00:22:39.480
 Not in the body.

00:22:39.480 --> 00:22:43.920
 And socks advertise themselves for decades afterwards as special, wow, new, non-poisonous

00:22:43.920 --> 00:22:44.920
 socks.

00:22:44.920 --> 00:22:45.920
 They won't kill you.

00:22:45.920 --> 00:22:46.920
 That was the thing.

00:22:46.920 --> 00:22:47.920
 Did they?

00:22:47.920 --> 00:22:48.920
 Yeah, there are.

00:22:48.920 --> 00:22:49.920
 Victorian ads.

00:22:49.920 --> 00:22:57.720
 In 2015, someone invented a pair of socks, which were powered by urine.

00:22:57.720 --> 00:22:58.720
 Right.

00:22:58.720 --> 00:23:00.320
 First question.

00:23:00.320 --> 00:23:02.280
 Why do you need to power your socks?

00:23:02.280 --> 00:23:05.360
 Can you not get around without powering them?

00:23:05.360 --> 00:23:06.360
 Good.

00:23:06.360 --> 00:23:07.360
 Great question.

00:23:07.360 --> 00:23:08.360
 Thank you.

00:23:08.360 --> 00:23:09.880
 No, no, it's not the only question.

00:23:09.880 --> 00:23:10.880
 Yeah.

00:23:10.880 --> 00:23:14.960
 There's another quite important question coming up about the urine powder.

00:23:14.960 --> 00:23:15.960
 Yeah.

00:23:15.960 --> 00:23:16.960
 Yeah.

00:23:16.960 --> 00:23:21.400
 So, what these are kind of designed for is if you are, let's say you're going for a hike

00:23:21.400 --> 00:23:29.240
 or you're out and you get lost or you get into distress and you need to send a signal

00:23:29.240 --> 00:23:30.240
 to some people.

00:23:30.240 --> 00:23:35.160
 But you've forgotten your phone and your, you know, pager or whatever else you were going

00:23:35.160 --> 00:23:36.160
 to use to someone.

00:23:36.160 --> 00:23:39.880
 Basically, you're only wearing a pair of socks, you're lost ever though.

00:23:39.880 --> 00:23:40.880
 That's right.

00:23:40.880 --> 00:23:41.880
 Yeah.

00:23:41.880 --> 00:23:42.880
 All your other clothes have gone.

00:23:42.880 --> 00:23:43.880
 Yeah.

00:23:43.880 --> 00:23:44.880
 You've woken up from a nightmare.

00:23:44.880 --> 00:23:45.880
 You shot him like yourself.

00:23:45.880 --> 00:23:47.400
 So, what do you do?

00:23:47.400 --> 00:23:48.400
 You're naked.

00:23:48.400 --> 00:23:49.400
 You're lost.

00:23:49.400 --> 00:23:51.280
 All you have is a pair of socks.

00:23:51.280 --> 00:23:57.560
 You just put all you have to do is piss yourself and these, when filled with urine and activated

00:23:57.560 --> 00:24:03.520
 by your footsteps, they can send a little message to any prospective rescuers because they've

00:24:03.520 --> 00:24:08.720
 got these tiny fuel cells which are turned on by fresh urine and the movement of your feet.

00:24:08.720 --> 00:24:10.440
 Why do they have to do that?

00:24:10.440 --> 00:24:12.440
 Why do they have to include the footstep bit?

00:24:12.440 --> 00:24:16.800
 Surely you could just like, I don't know, spin them around or something.

00:24:16.800 --> 00:24:21.920
 Why do you have to put your pissy socks back on?

00:24:21.920 --> 00:24:24.080
 I don't think you need to take them off in the first place.

00:24:24.080 --> 00:24:25.880
 You just need to piss off.

00:24:25.880 --> 00:24:27.080
 Carefully weed down your legs.

00:24:27.080 --> 00:24:28.080
 Just piss on your feet.

00:24:28.080 --> 00:24:29.080
 Yeah.

00:24:29.080 --> 00:24:30.080
 Okay.

00:24:30.080 --> 00:24:34.960
 I think that would be very difficult, especially as a woman, to actually manage to weed into

00:24:34.960 --> 00:24:36.840
 a sock whilst wearing it.

00:24:36.840 --> 00:24:41.200
 Actually, for a man, most of the challenges not pissing on your feet.

00:24:41.200 --> 00:24:42.200
 Yeah.

00:24:42.200 --> 00:24:44.480
 And who's this, who's this notifying Andy?

00:24:44.480 --> 00:24:48.280
 Is this like some unit of spin centre by the authorities?

00:24:48.280 --> 00:24:49.280
 Okay.

00:24:49.280 --> 00:24:50.280
 Yeah.

00:24:50.280 --> 00:24:54.840
 Like, you know, you know, Prince William, when he worked for Mountain Rescue, he used to

00:24:54.840 --> 00:25:00.520
 talk about getting the urine sock alarm every few days, didn't he?

00:25:00.520 --> 00:25:01.520
 Yeah.

00:25:01.520 --> 00:25:05.440
 So it means that it just proves that you're still alive and that you're worth rescuing.

00:25:05.440 --> 00:25:06.440
 Ah.

00:25:06.440 --> 00:25:07.440
 Ah, you at that stage?

00:25:07.440 --> 00:25:08.440
 I did not.

00:25:08.440 --> 00:25:09.440
 I didn't know.

00:25:09.440 --> 00:25:10.440
 I didn't know.

00:25:10.440 --> 00:25:11.440
 Are you really worth rescuing?

00:25:11.440 --> 00:25:17.480
 I think I'm probably rather not be rescued at that point.

00:25:17.480 --> 00:25:21.280
 I was just thinking when you said they had adverts for socks that don't kill you.

00:25:21.280 --> 00:25:23.640
 You don't see many adverts for socks these days, do you?

00:25:23.640 --> 00:25:24.640
 No, that's true.

00:25:24.640 --> 00:25:27.080
 Can you just assume you're just going to buy that, by guess?

00:25:27.080 --> 00:25:28.080
 Yeah.

00:25:28.080 --> 00:25:29.080
 Yeah.

00:25:29.080 --> 00:25:30.080
 Yeah.

00:25:30.080 --> 00:25:31.080
 It's usually when they do stunts, isn't it?

00:25:31.080 --> 00:25:32.080
 Stunt advertising.

00:25:32.080 --> 00:25:38.000
 So Ted Baker did an advert a few years ago, which was they started selling socks in odd pairs.

00:25:38.000 --> 00:25:41.120
 So they would sell you instead of just two socks, prepare it.

00:25:41.120 --> 00:25:45.800
 They would sell you three because there was a report of how we lose an odd sock.

00:25:45.800 --> 00:25:46.920
 We always have an odd sock.

00:25:46.920 --> 00:25:51.120
 So why not give you an extra sock so that you've always got a pair on the go, yeah?

00:25:51.120 --> 00:25:52.120
 That's quite clever.

00:25:52.120 --> 00:25:55.560
 I find that very annoying and discomforting, actually.

00:25:55.560 --> 00:25:57.040
 Yeah, me too, actually.

00:25:57.040 --> 00:25:58.040
 That was very stunty.

00:25:58.040 --> 00:25:59.040
 Yeah.

00:25:59.040 --> 00:26:00.040
 They had a sock amnesty.

00:26:00.040 --> 00:26:04.000
 You were meant to bring in that one odd sock if you were able to buy the pack of three.

00:26:04.000 --> 00:26:08.040
 Basically, what happens is, as soon as you buy these three socks, you immediately have

00:26:08.040 --> 00:26:09.040
 an odd sock.

00:26:09.040 --> 00:26:10.040
 Yes.

00:26:10.040 --> 00:26:14.880
 So if you buy two, if you buy two of them, then you don't, then you have three pairs of socks.

00:26:14.880 --> 00:26:15.880
 Right.

00:26:15.880 --> 00:26:18.280
 But then you can buy three pairs of socks, aren't you?

00:26:18.280 --> 00:26:19.280
 Yeah.

00:26:19.280 --> 00:26:26.320
 No, but there is a thing about sorting your socks, which is how amazingly difficult it

00:26:26.320 --> 00:26:31.680
 gets as soon as you have any reasonable number of interesting socks.

00:26:31.680 --> 00:26:36.440
 So if you have, so, and there are two problems with sock matching, which is if you have more

00:26:36.440 --> 00:26:45.800
 than one pair, which I do, sorry, bragg, hashtag bragg, one of them is full of piss, though.

00:26:45.800 --> 00:26:49.120
 But if you have more than one pair, firstly, you need to pair more socks, obviously.

00:26:49.120 --> 00:26:53.320
 But secondly, there is a larger part of unmatched socks that you have to hunt through, right?

00:26:53.320 --> 00:26:58.600
 So if you have five pairs of socks, it actually takes 25 times longer to match than one pair

00:26:58.600 --> 00:26:59.600
 of socks.

00:26:59.600 --> 00:27:00.600
 Okay.

00:27:00.600 --> 00:27:01.600
 This is by an algorithm.

00:27:01.600 --> 00:27:07.520
 Allegedly, if you have 100 different pairs of socks, right, it would take 10,000 times

00:27:07.520 --> 00:27:12.680
 longer to sort them, then one pair of socks.

00:27:12.680 --> 00:27:15.560
 No, I don't believe that.

00:27:15.560 --> 00:27:19.800
 And that's worked out that you're obviously sort of pairing them down every time you find a pair.

00:27:19.800 --> 00:27:22.680
 Yeah, I mean, I see the algorithms done its job.

00:27:22.680 --> 00:27:23.680
 I think so.

00:27:23.680 --> 00:27:24.680
 But they haven't done trials.

00:27:24.680 --> 00:27:25.680
 The end it gets easier.

00:27:25.680 --> 00:27:26.680
 Yeah.

00:27:26.680 --> 00:27:27.680
 Yeah, absolutely.

00:27:27.680 --> 00:27:30.320
 But the answer, obviously, is to only buy one kind of socks and just buy a hundred of those.

00:27:30.320 --> 00:27:31.320
 Yeah.

00:27:31.320 --> 00:27:32.920
 Hey, Andy, I've got one more question about your piss socks.

00:27:32.920 --> 00:27:33.920
 Oh my gosh.

00:27:33.920 --> 00:27:34.920
 God.

00:27:34.920 --> 00:27:42.080
 James raised a point there before, which is sometimes it's difficult for guys to aim properly

00:27:42.080 --> 00:27:43.080
 and that could land.

00:27:43.080 --> 00:27:50.560
 But has there been any cases where the authorities have busted into someone's house because they

00:27:50.560 --> 00:27:53.920
 pissed on their socks all the time?

00:27:53.920 --> 00:27:56.760
 Yeah, I think that's that.

00:27:56.760 --> 00:27:59.200
 Not as far as I know, but what a great question.

00:27:59.200 --> 00:28:05.120
 It sounds like you haven't really done the research here, Andy.

00:28:05.120 --> 00:28:07.560
 I'm just talking about the fact that there's no sock advertising.

00:28:07.560 --> 00:28:10.200
 I really like fun socks.

00:28:10.200 --> 00:28:13.000
 And so I'm quite surprised that people don't, you know, companies don't make a bigger

00:28:13.000 --> 00:28:14.000
 deal out of them.

00:28:14.000 --> 00:28:19.880
 And I especially feel sorry for men when they have to wear suits or like quite bland matching

00:28:19.880 --> 00:28:20.880
 outfits.

00:28:20.880 --> 00:28:25.800
 I know you're all wearing like cartoon themed tops today, but we're working from home.

00:28:25.800 --> 00:28:29.320
 But that's the only way that you can really express yourself, right?

00:28:29.320 --> 00:28:31.360
 It's by wearing stupid socks.

00:28:31.360 --> 00:28:35.360
 So I was looking at some stupid socks and I hadn't realized something that I think a lot

00:28:35.360 --> 00:28:41.320
 of Canadians are aware of, which is that true dough engages in sock diplomacy a lot.

00:28:41.320 --> 00:28:45.760
 And so every sort of diplomatic event he goes to, he's wearing a different and appropriate

00:28:45.760 --> 00:28:47.280
 pair of socks.

00:28:47.280 --> 00:28:51.440
 And it was particularly apparent when he marched in Toronto's gay pride parade, wearing

00:28:51.440 --> 00:28:56.520
 a rainbow striped pair, but printed with the words eedmubarak because it was also eed

00:28:56.520 --> 00:28:59.160
 the end of Ramadan at the time.

00:28:59.160 --> 00:29:00.160
 Wow.

00:29:00.160 --> 00:29:02.720
 And they were made by a Toronto based company.

00:29:02.720 --> 00:29:05.960
 Unfortunately, unfortunately nobody noticed any of that because he was also blacked up

00:29:05.960 --> 00:29:10.960
 at the time.

00:29:10.960 --> 00:29:16.080
 And I have one fact about which could have gone into this fact all the previous one, okay?

00:29:16.080 --> 00:29:17.080
 Okay.

00:29:17.080 --> 00:29:22.520
 So in 2014, there was a great day in an Oregon which was found to be in some distress and

00:29:22.520 --> 00:29:24.440
 his owners took him to the vet.

00:29:24.440 --> 00:29:27.640
 And if you combine this fact with the previous one, you know what I'm about to say, but they

00:29:27.640 --> 00:29:30.200
 found he'd been swallowing socks.

00:29:30.200 --> 00:29:31.200
 And they've-

00:29:31.200 --> 00:29:35.000
 It's all really just now about guessing the number of pairs of socks that he's wearing

00:29:35.000 --> 00:29:36.000
 from our perspective.

00:29:36.000 --> 00:29:40.720
 How long do you think it would have taken to match the socks of that kind of reason?

00:29:40.720 --> 00:29:46.760
 I reckon the maximum number of socks that a great day can eat for your notice and take

00:29:46.760 --> 00:29:49.000
 them to the vet is 16.

00:29:49.000 --> 00:29:50.000
 Okay.

00:29:50.000 --> 00:29:51.000
 Okay.

00:29:51.000 --> 00:29:52.000
 Pairs or individuals?

00:29:52.000 --> 00:29:53.000
 Individuals.

00:29:53.000 --> 00:29:55.000
 Because I guess they wouldn't necessarily swallow them in pairs.

00:29:55.000 --> 00:29:56.000
 Go on.

00:29:56.000 --> 00:29:57.000
 Any other guesses?

00:29:57.000 --> 00:30:00.200
 I'm going to say one sock, yes.

00:30:00.200 --> 00:30:01.200
 Wow.

00:30:01.200 --> 00:30:02.200
 Okay.

00:30:02.200 --> 00:30:03.200
 Great Danes are.

00:30:03.200 --> 00:30:04.200
 They're great.

00:30:04.200 --> 00:30:05.200
 So they can fit probably quite a lot.

00:30:05.200 --> 00:30:06.200
 I think 30 socks.

00:30:06.200 --> 00:30:11.440
 I'm going to say, Dan, my ex had a dog who once had a sock and we had to get the sock out

00:30:11.440 --> 00:30:15.360
 of it, which was an interesting day for us.

00:30:15.360 --> 00:30:20.560
 But I'm not sure that the international press would have been particularly interested in

00:30:20.560 --> 00:30:23.080
 jumping to one sock.

00:30:23.080 --> 00:30:26.440
 Or you missed an opportunity in reporting your story, James.

00:30:26.440 --> 00:30:27.440
 Yeah.

00:30:27.440 --> 00:30:31.560
 No, that's very good tactical thinking from James.

00:30:31.560 --> 00:30:33.760
 So thank you, Dan, for just getting one sock.

00:30:33.760 --> 00:30:38.000
 Because normally I was assuming you would do your usual thing and guess if you can 5,000

00:30:38.000 --> 00:30:39.000
 socks.

00:30:39.000 --> 00:30:40.000
 Exactly.

00:30:40.000 --> 00:30:43.000
 I was going to say 100,000.

00:30:43.000 --> 00:30:46.680
 This dog had eaten 43 and a half socks.

00:30:46.680 --> 00:30:47.680
 Wow.

00:30:47.680 --> 00:30:48.680
 Yeah.

00:30:48.680 --> 00:30:51.200
 And they had to do a sockectomy on it.

00:30:51.200 --> 00:30:57.040
 And in fact, this became news because it was published in the Trade magazine, Veterinary Practice

00:30:57.040 --> 00:30:58.040
 News.

00:30:58.040 --> 00:31:01.160
 And they had a competition for the animal which had eaten the most unusual thing.

00:31:01.160 --> 00:31:02.160
 And this great Dan won.

00:31:02.160 --> 00:31:03.160
 Great.

00:31:03.160 --> 00:31:08.520
 But there were some other runners-up in the competition which included a frog in Texas which

00:31:08.520 --> 00:31:14.120
 had eaten the rocks from its rockery and a dog in Florida which had eaten the kebab.

00:31:14.120 --> 00:31:17.480
 Now, that doesn't sound interesting, but it had also eaten the skewer.

00:31:17.480 --> 00:31:18.480
 Oh, God.

00:31:18.480 --> 00:31:20.480
 That's going to hurt.

00:31:20.480 --> 00:31:27.840
 Okay, it is time for fact number three and that is my fact.

00:31:27.840 --> 00:31:33.760
 My fact this week is that in 2016 a man won the lottery for the second time using the exact

00:31:33.760 --> 00:31:36.920
 same numbers that won it for him the first time.

00:31:36.920 --> 00:31:39.600
 That man's name is Larry Gamble's.

00:31:39.600 --> 00:31:43.560
 And he hasn't changed his name since he did this.

00:31:43.560 --> 00:31:44.560
 No, no.

00:31:44.560 --> 00:31:45.560
 This was his name.

00:31:45.560 --> 00:31:50.600
 He also like bouncing around fields like a sheep.

00:31:50.600 --> 00:31:51.600
 He's not Larry Gamble's.

00:31:51.600 --> 00:31:52.600
 Oh, sorry.

00:31:52.600 --> 00:31:53.600
 That's a different guy.

00:31:53.600 --> 00:31:54.600
 I think he is.

00:31:54.600 --> 00:32:01.080
 Larry Gamble's, he's from Madison, Illinois, which is a small place south of Chicago.

00:32:01.080 --> 00:32:07.040
 And he won a million dollars in 2016 as part of a lottery and the numbers that he used were

00:32:07.040 --> 00:32:12.440
 the same numbers that he used nine years ago when he won 50,000 in a different lottery.

00:32:12.440 --> 00:32:15.080
 So he worked twice for him.

00:32:15.080 --> 00:32:20.840
 And yeah, he obviously made the news because of his name because of his name, you know,

00:32:20.840 --> 00:32:24.520
 it's not like a great day in the sock.

00:32:24.520 --> 00:32:29.680
 He was asked if he had any advice on how to win the lottery, which is a great question

00:32:29.680 --> 00:32:32.920
 for journalists to ask.

00:32:32.920 --> 00:32:36.240
 And he said, "Pick your favourite numbers and stick with them.

00:32:36.240 --> 00:32:37.240
 It worked for me."

00:32:37.240 --> 00:32:38.240
 That is.

00:32:38.240 --> 00:32:39.240
 So there you go.

00:32:39.240 --> 00:32:40.240
 Guaranteed.

00:32:40.240 --> 00:32:41.240
 Sure, if I were winning.

00:32:41.240 --> 00:32:43.280
 I would argue that that's bad advice, though, right?

00:32:43.280 --> 00:32:48.760
 Because unless your favourite numbers are numbers that no one else likes, which is pretty

00:32:48.760 --> 00:32:52.640
 unlikely, statistically, you're more likely to like the number seven or the number three

00:32:52.640 --> 00:32:53.640
 or whatever.

00:32:53.640 --> 00:32:55.720
 You want to be choosing numbers that no one likes.

00:32:55.720 --> 00:32:56.920
 You want to be choosing horrible ones.

00:32:56.920 --> 00:32:57.920
 You're right.

00:32:57.920 --> 00:32:58.920
 Yeah, because then you get more.

00:32:58.920 --> 00:33:02.760
 Well, there was an article I was reading, which was saying that in each national lottery

00:33:02.760 --> 00:33:08.360
 draw, 10,000 people on average choose the numbers one, two, three, four, five and six.

00:33:08.360 --> 00:33:12.480
 And given the amount of most jackpots, which is about four million, that means even if

00:33:12.480 --> 00:33:13.960
 you win, you get four hundred quid.

00:33:13.960 --> 00:33:14.960
 Yeah.

00:33:14.960 --> 00:33:15.960
 Oh, wow.

00:33:15.960 --> 00:33:16.960
 Because it has a split between those people.

00:33:16.960 --> 00:33:17.960
 Mad.

00:33:17.960 --> 00:33:21.040
 I reckon that that serves you right for being so unimaginative.

00:33:21.040 --> 00:33:22.040
 Agreed.

00:33:22.040 --> 00:33:24.800
 I could not agree more.

00:33:24.800 --> 00:33:30.040
 Also, I know the number of combinations is so massive that, and I know that that is as

00:33:30.040 --> 00:33:32.280
 likely a combination of numbers as any other.

00:33:32.280 --> 00:33:33.280
 Is that correct?

00:33:33.280 --> 00:33:34.280
 Yeah.

00:33:34.280 --> 00:33:35.280
 Like getting those one, two, three.

00:33:35.280 --> 00:33:36.600
 However, I think we can all agree.

00:33:36.600 --> 00:33:37.600
 It's just not going to happen, is it?

00:33:37.600 --> 00:33:39.400
 It's never going to be one, two, three, four, five, six.

00:33:39.400 --> 00:33:40.400
 It's not.

00:33:40.400 --> 00:33:41.400
 You're right.

00:33:41.400 --> 00:33:42.400
 Of course not.

00:33:42.400 --> 00:33:44.400
 Imagine the statistics be damned.

00:33:44.400 --> 00:33:45.400
 It will be a complete scandal.

00:33:45.400 --> 00:33:46.920
 It will be outrageous.

00:33:46.920 --> 00:33:51.040
 Actually, you know, you've got the first ever lottery ticket in the UK.

00:33:51.040 --> 00:33:53.280
 I think it was John Major.

00:33:53.280 --> 00:33:54.280
 Oh, yeah.

00:33:54.280 --> 00:33:55.280
 Prime Minister.

00:33:55.280 --> 00:33:58.720
 Did they not say that he was worried that he was going to win or something?

00:33:58.720 --> 00:33:59.720
 Yes.

00:33:59.720 --> 00:34:02.560
 He hoped he wouldn't win, because if he won, he would have to give the money back, and he

00:34:02.560 --> 00:34:07.440
 knew that his wife would be furious if he won and then he'd have to give back the money.

00:34:07.440 --> 00:34:10.200
 Imagine if the first ever national lottery, right?

00:34:10.200 --> 00:34:11.200
 It came up.

00:34:11.200 --> 00:34:13.720
 And I know if you guys remember it, you're probably too young.

00:34:13.720 --> 00:34:16.200
 I remember it because I was 16 and I could buy tickets.

00:34:16.200 --> 00:34:17.200
 It was really exciting.

00:34:17.200 --> 00:34:22.840
 But imagine if the first ball that came out was one, and then it was two, and it was three

00:34:22.840 --> 00:34:26.640
 and a four, then five and six, which is equally likely it could have happened.

00:34:26.640 --> 00:34:27.640
 Yeah.

00:34:27.640 --> 00:34:29.000
 I think that would have been just the end of it.

00:34:29.000 --> 00:34:30.480
 No one would have trusted it ever again.

00:34:30.480 --> 00:34:31.480
 It would have been a scandal.

00:34:31.480 --> 00:34:32.480
 No one would ever buy a ticket again.

00:34:32.480 --> 00:34:38.200
 And then John Major's in the corner, because he is absolutely the sort of guy who would

00:34:38.200 --> 00:34:39.920
 have taken those numbers.

00:34:39.920 --> 00:34:40.920
 Yes.

00:34:40.920 --> 00:34:41.920
 It's just likely.

00:34:41.920 --> 00:34:44.720
 So any other combination?

00:34:44.720 --> 00:34:48.320
 I find this sticking with the same numbers thing really weird, because I found a headline in

00:34:48.320 --> 00:34:49.320
 the telegraph.

00:34:49.320 --> 00:34:50.560
 This just made me laugh so much.

00:34:50.560 --> 00:34:55.920
 It said, "Millionaire lottery winner dreamt numbers 28 years ago."

00:34:55.920 --> 00:35:05.280
 And this was a woman who, these numbers came to her in a dream in 1989, and then in 2017, they

00:35:05.280 --> 00:35:06.280
 came up.

00:35:06.280 --> 00:35:07.280
 Wow.

00:35:07.280 --> 00:35:12.920
 Did the dream tell her that it was 2017, or did she just not go round to it?

00:35:12.920 --> 00:35:14.680
 No, she'd been, she'd been placing the bets.

00:35:14.680 --> 00:35:16.600
 Every single week on that number.

00:35:16.600 --> 00:35:18.600
 So many ways.

00:35:18.600 --> 00:35:19.600
 Yeah.

00:35:19.600 --> 00:35:20.600
 What grandmother does that?

00:35:20.600 --> 00:35:21.600
 Okay.

00:35:21.600 --> 00:35:22.600
 My grandmother keeps the same numbers.

00:35:22.600 --> 00:35:28.000
 I think I do see the logic in keeping the same numbers once you've decided on them, because

00:35:28.000 --> 00:35:32.360
 then if the numbers do come out, you feel like, "Ah, they were my numbers, and I should have

00:35:32.360 --> 00:35:34.640
 put them back on this week, and I didn't do it."

00:35:34.640 --> 00:35:35.640
 Yes.

00:35:35.640 --> 00:35:39.240
 And once you've started doing that, see the logic between behind not stopping.

00:35:39.240 --> 00:35:43.480
 My grandmother says that she didn't buy them one week, and that was the week when numbers

00:35:43.480 --> 00:35:44.480
 came up.

00:35:44.480 --> 00:35:50.040
 I just don't believe it at all, but she, that's a story in our family, she says it.

00:35:50.040 --> 00:35:53.360
 The other logical fallacy that people have is that they look at the numbers and they're

00:35:53.360 --> 00:35:54.360
 out by just one.

00:35:54.360 --> 00:36:00.280
 And you're like, "Ah, I had 45, and 46 came out, but apart from the fact that each ball is

00:36:00.280 --> 00:36:01.760
 not related, they're just numbers."

00:36:01.760 --> 00:36:02.760
 Yeah.

00:36:02.760 --> 00:36:06.800
 But of course, there are twice as many numbers that are won away from your number as your

00:36:06.800 --> 00:36:07.800
 actual number.

00:36:07.800 --> 00:36:08.800
 Oh, yeah.

00:36:08.800 --> 00:36:11.760
 So your twice is likely to be won away as the actual number.

00:36:11.760 --> 00:36:12.760
 That's a really good point.

00:36:12.760 --> 00:36:13.760
 I had thought about that.

00:36:13.760 --> 00:36:17.240
 Andy, you were saying about the person who came up with the number through a dream.

00:36:17.240 --> 00:36:19.840
 Did you hear about this guy in Spain in the 1970s?

00:36:19.840 --> 00:36:20.840
 No.

00:36:20.840 --> 00:36:21.840
 No.

00:36:21.840 --> 00:36:27.080
 So the way it works in Spain is you could go around the shop looking for specific numbers.

00:36:27.080 --> 00:36:30.880
 They printed out the numbers and you would choose whichever one you wanted.

00:36:30.880 --> 00:36:38.880
 This guy decided that he wanted a lottery ticket ending in 48, 48, so he went around all

00:36:38.880 --> 00:36:44.720
 the shops and eventually found a ticket and he bought it and he won the lottery and they interviewed

00:36:44.720 --> 00:36:49.080
 him afterwards like they always do and they said, "Oh, why, you know, what was your secret?"

00:36:49.080 --> 00:36:52.760
 And he said, "Oh, well, I was looking for this 48 and they said, "Oh, why are you looking

00:36:52.760 --> 00:36:53.760
 for the 48?"

00:36:53.760 --> 00:36:58.640
 And he said, "Well, I dreamt of the number seven for seven straight nights and seven times

00:36:58.640 --> 00:37:05.640
 seven is 48."

00:37:05.640 --> 00:37:06.640
 So good.

00:37:06.640 --> 00:37:07.640
 And it worked.

00:37:07.640 --> 00:37:08.640
 I love to win.

00:37:08.640 --> 00:37:11.400
 Have you guys heard of Stefan Mandel?

00:37:11.400 --> 00:37:14.560
 You may well have done researching people who won the lottery lots.

00:37:14.560 --> 00:37:22.200
 So he was a Romanian economist and he ended up winning the lottery 14 times because he worked

00:37:22.200 --> 00:37:29.280
 out that what he would do is he would form a syndicate and he grew up very, very poor

00:37:29.280 --> 00:37:30.280
 Romania.

00:37:30.280 --> 00:37:33.560
 He wanted to earn some real money and he would find a lottery and he would wait until

00:37:33.560 --> 00:37:38.520
 the jackpot for the lottery was bigger than all possible combinations of tickets.

00:37:38.520 --> 00:37:40.960
 So if you bought, you know, every single number.

00:37:40.960 --> 00:37:44.680
 So that only applies to certain lotteries obviously because if you did it for things like

00:37:44.680 --> 00:37:50.520
 the Euro-Million, it will be so expensive to buy tickets for every combination.

00:37:50.520 --> 00:37:56.400
 So he formed this syndicate and he what waited and then he would just buy every single ticket.

00:37:56.400 --> 00:37:59.120
 But the main tricky thing is the logistics of it.

00:37:59.120 --> 00:38:04.240
 So he had a team of people in Melbourne, he moved to Australia and he found a lottery in

00:38:04.240 --> 00:38:09.200
 Virginia in the USA which had enough money in the jackpot.

00:38:09.200 --> 00:38:12.080
 So you could print your own tickets at the time.

00:38:12.080 --> 00:38:15.520
 So he printed off one ton of tickets.

00:38:15.520 --> 00:38:19.760
 He had to ship them all the way to the USA from Australia.

00:38:19.760 --> 00:38:26.000
 He waited for the jackpot to be right and then on a certain week in 1992 the jackpot hit

00:38:26.000 --> 00:38:30.040
 $15 million and he said this is the week we need to go for it.

00:38:30.040 --> 00:38:36.960
 But he had to form a team of people to take 1.4 million tickets to a shop and queue up, pay

00:38:36.960 --> 00:38:40.600
 for them, get them processed and they're registered as being properly bought.

00:38:40.600 --> 00:38:44.400
 And they had three days to do it, 1.4 million tickets.

00:38:44.400 --> 00:38:50.120
 He hired couriers who had tens of thousands of tickets each and almost all of them got

00:38:50.120 --> 00:38:55.680
 through but there was one batch of tickets, 140,000 which weren't registered.

00:38:55.680 --> 00:39:04.000
 There was one ticket which wasn't bought, it was one, two, three, four, five, six.

00:39:04.000 --> 00:39:09.440
 And so when the time came there was so stressed obviously that the jackpot was in that one combination

00:39:09.440 --> 00:39:10.800
 of numbers they would have missed out.

00:39:10.800 --> 00:39:13.080
 Thankfully they got it and they won.

00:39:13.080 --> 00:39:16.920
 How much was it then that ended up being divided as in how much did each person get?

00:39:16.920 --> 00:39:20.440
 Did they get enough to make it worth that obscene and absurd apple?

00:39:20.440 --> 00:39:24.200
 I think a lot of people did not get enough to make it worth a hassle but I think he got

00:39:24.200 --> 00:39:29.080
 several million dollars and he moved to Vanuatu, the Pacific Island so yeah but everyone got

00:39:29.080 --> 00:39:30.840
 some money, everyone did win, you know.

00:39:30.840 --> 00:39:31.840
 Okay, worth it.

00:39:31.840 --> 00:39:36.680
 I was just thinking if you did buy all the tickets apart from one then basically your odds

00:39:36.680 --> 00:39:42.200
 of it being a complete disaster is the same as my odds of winning the lottery if I only buy

00:39:42.200 --> 00:39:43.480
 one ticket, isn't it?

00:39:43.480 --> 00:39:44.480
 Yeah.

00:39:44.480 --> 00:39:45.480
 That's true.

00:39:45.480 --> 00:39:47.480
 I am flukking at things.

00:39:47.480 --> 00:39:52.680
 It's always showing us the new angle.

00:39:52.680 --> 00:39:57.000
 That's the odds of losing the lottery in that case, isn't it?

00:39:57.000 --> 00:39:58.000
 Yeah.

00:39:58.000 --> 00:40:04.280
 I think about another guy in Melbourne actually, as you said that guy was who won and he sort

00:40:04.280 --> 00:40:09.240
 of often appears on articles about you know Lockest Man in the world and that's this guy

00:40:09.240 --> 00:40:15.240
 called Bill Morgan who was in the 90s, he had a bad accident actually and this ends happily

00:40:15.240 --> 00:40:18.320
 by the way that's why people say he's the Lockest Man in the world before you start getting

00:40:18.320 --> 00:40:19.320
 upset.

00:40:19.320 --> 00:40:24.640
 So he had an accident where he ended up dead for 14 minutes.

00:40:24.640 --> 00:40:25.640
 Oh right, sorry.

00:40:25.640 --> 00:40:33.240
 He genuinely, I thought that was a very short story.

00:40:33.240 --> 00:40:37.920
 He ended up dead for 14 minutes like clinically dead but they resuscitated him, he you know

00:40:37.920 --> 00:40:42.600
 and twice, he was in a coma for 12 days, they were advised to turn off his life support

00:40:42.600 --> 00:40:46.880
 twice because they were like he's going to be completely brain dead but he woke up completely

00:40:46.880 --> 00:40:49.680
 fine, turned up, didn't have any brain damage at all.

00:40:49.680 --> 00:40:55.200
 So he proposed to his girlfriend straight away, said yes and to celebrate a bit of a low

00:40:55.200 --> 00:41:00.560
 brown way of celebrating but he bought a scratch card and he scratched it off and he'd want

00:41:00.560 --> 00:41:06.880
 a car and so he was delighted about this and he, and the local news, very, very local news

00:41:06.880 --> 00:41:10.680
 I guess got in touch but I mean it was quite a big story because he'd been in this coma and

00:41:10.680 --> 00:41:13.080
 he'd suddenly come out and he'd won this car.

00:41:13.080 --> 00:41:14.080
 So the local news came.

00:41:14.080 --> 00:41:18.640
 Did the local news, the local news also accuse him of being low brown for celebrating coming

00:41:18.640 --> 00:41:22.960
 out of his coma?

00:41:22.960 --> 00:41:27.160
 I think what I meant was it was quite an underwhelming way to celebrate buying one scratch

00:41:27.160 --> 00:41:28.640
 card, you know?

00:41:28.640 --> 00:41:29.640
 Okay.

00:41:29.640 --> 00:41:34.680
 Look fine, it's a perfectly decent way to celebrate surviving a coma and getting engaged

00:41:34.680 --> 00:41:35.680
 buying a scratch card.

00:41:35.680 --> 00:41:39.080
 I know what you mean because it's like if you get engaged there's, it's sort of saying

00:41:39.080 --> 00:41:43.800
 I am happy to be with you rather than I wish for a dramatic change in my life circumstances.

00:41:43.800 --> 00:41:48.960
 So it's a slightly, there's a bit of side eye to it if you say let's, let's try and change

00:41:48.960 --> 00:41:49.960
 everything.

00:41:49.960 --> 00:41:51.800
 It's actually a bit of an insult, isn't it?

00:41:51.800 --> 00:41:55.520
 Right now I've doomed my life, let's try and find something that can possibly resuscitate

00:41:55.520 --> 00:41:56.520
 it.

00:41:56.520 --> 00:42:02.200
 Anyway, this film, local film crew came to film his delight and they asked him to reenact

00:42:02.200 --> 00:42:07.320
 the moment that he'd won the car and so they got him to buy another scratch card and

00:42:07.320 --> 00:42:08.320
 scratch it off to reenact.

00:42:08.320 --> 00:42:12.240
 Oh my god, I've won a car and then he looked down at the scratch card and he went, oh my

00:42:12.240 --> 00:42:18.720
 god, I've won $250,000 and they were like, well you got the line wrong mate and there's

00:42:18.720 --> 00:42:21.120
 other scratch card, one of 250 grand.

00:42:21.120 --> 00:42:22.120
 Wow.

00:42:22.120 --> 00:42:26.560
 And he immediately dumped his fiancee.

00:42:26.560 --> 00:42:32.320
 Okay, it's time for our final fact of the show and that is James.

00:42:32.320 --> 00:42:37.160
 Okay, in my fact this week is that Zagreb has a museum of hangovers.

00:42:37.160 --> 00:42:42.640
 His inventor was inspired when a friend woke up one morning with an unexplained bike pedal

00:42:42.640 --> 00:42:46.940
 in his pocket.

00:42:46.940 --> 00:42:53.960
 So this is a guy called a Reno W. Yockovich who was a university student in Zagreb in Croatia

00:42:53.960 --> 00:42:58.960
 and he said that he told journalists that a friend spoke about how he woke up with a bicycle

00:42:58.960 --> 00:43:04.680
 pedal in his pocket and I thought, as I listened to him, why not set up a place and museum with

00:43:04.680 --> 00:43:09.640
 a collection of these objects as stories that will illustrate in a funny way these evenings

00:43:09.640 --> 00:43:12.600
 of drunkenness and the hangover the next day.

00:43:12.600 --> 00:43:16.440
 I rather than just thinking it, he actually went and did it and this is the thing that now

00:43:16.440 --> 00:43:19.240
 exists in Croatia.

00:43:19.240 --> 00:43:21.640
 It's amazing that it's a real place, yeah.

00:43:21.640 --> 00:43:23.880
 Yeah, it sounds really cool, doesn't it?

00:43:23.880 --> 00:43:28.200
 The idea of visit when you go inside it, it recreates your drunken journey home so it's

00:43:28.200 --> 00:43:33.800
 room by room, you start in the bar and then you go on to sort of graffiti lined walls

00:43:33.800 --> 00:43:38.680
 that emulate a street and then you get to store fronts and then at a guard and finally your

00:43:38.680 --> 00:43:39.680
 bedroom.

00:43:39.680 --> 00:43:40.680
 That's the end of the museum.

00:43:40.680 --> 00:43:45.160
 Finally, you swallow your house key.

00:43:45.160 --> 00:43:50.120
 They have chalkboard in there where it features the beginning of a sentence which is, I woke

00:43:50.120 --> 00:43:54.800
 up with and then you can write in your answers of, you know, the worst thing you've woken

00:43:54.800 --> 00:43:59.540
 up with when you've had a hangover and answers in the museum at the moment or when this

00:43:59.540 --> 00:44:05.980
 answer was written include two stray dogs, a lot of pumpkins and I saw the girl who wrote

00:44:05.980 --> 00:44:11.980
 this, one eye, now this is very frustrating because I saw there's like a video footage

00:44:11.980 --> 00:44:16.060
 of inside the museum and you see this girl write one eye but you only see her in profile

00:44:16.060 --> 00:44:19.020
 so I couldn't find out if she was lying.

00:44:19.020 --> 00:44:24.020
 But it could be that you've lost one of your eyes so you've woken up with one eye or that

00:44:24.020 --> 00:44:27.440
 you've woken up with someone else's eye in addition to your own.

00:44:27.440 --> 00:44:31.440
 It's either one or three eyes you've got altogether, isn't it?

00:44:31.440 --> 00:44:32.440
 Yes, exactly.

00:44:32.440 --> 00:44:33.440
 Yeah.

00:44:33.440 --> 00:44:34.440
 Which would you prefer?

00:44:34.440 --> 00:44:35.440
 Oh.

00:44:35.440 --> 00:44:36.440
 I should think three.

00:44:36.440 --> 00:44:37.440
 I don't know.

00:44:37.440 --> 00:44:39.120
 That implies you might have done something awful though.

00:44:39.120 --> 00:44:40.120
 Does it?

00:44:40.120 --> 00:44:43.440
 I think that waking up with only one eye implies that something awful has happened.

00:44:43.440 --> 00:44:46.960
 No, but I mean, I think it depends if you'd rather harm yourself or someone else James.

00:44:46.960 --> 00:44:49.280
 Maybe that's the difference between you and me, you know?

00:44:49.280 --> 00:44:53.080
 Well, one other difference between you and me is I assumed I just found the eye.

00:44:53.080 --> 00:44:54.080
 I need to.

00:44:54.080 --> 00:44:56.160
 I've done something awful to someone to get it.

00:44:56.160 --> 00:44:58.160
 I assume I've gouged it out of a love ride.

00:44:58.160 --> 00:44:59.160
 I've just seen James.

00:44:59.160 --> 00:45:03.160
 You're happy with the three eye option yet the three sock option you seem to be very hesitant

00:45:03.160 --> 00:45:04.160
 to have.

00:45:04.160 --> 00:45:09.680
 Well, what I'm thinking is if I've had three more eyes, then I might have to have some eyes.

00:45:09.680 --> 00:45:12.440
 But James, that will take longer to match them all up.

00:45:12.440 --> 00:45:13.440
 Yep.

00:45:13.440 --> 00:45:14.440
 You're absolutely right.

00:45:14.440 --> 00:45:16.640
 You've got a big pile of eyes that you have to match with.

00:45:16.640 --> 00:45:17.640
 Yeah.

00:45:17.640 --> 00:45:18.640
 Not if they're all the same colours.

00:45:18.640 --> 00:45:20.640
 As long as you've got all blue eyes, you're fine, right?

00:45:20.640 --> 00:45:21.640
 Yep.

00:45:21.640 --> 00:45:22.640
 Yeah, that's true.

00:45:22.640 --> 00:45:24.840
 So if you're ever going to be gouging out people's eyes, why don't go for people

00:45:24.840 --> 00:45:25.840
 with the same eye colour.

00:45:25.840 --> 00:45:26.840
 Just a little tip.

00:45:26.840 --> 00:45:31.400
 Probably an amateur to the professional murderous out there.

00:45:31.400 --> 00:45:37.520
 I think I would definitely hope for the chance that I had done something horrible over the

00:45:37.520 --> 00:45:40.240
 guarantee of having lost an eye.

00:45:40.240 --> 00:45:44.120
 Because I trust my drunken self not to take someone's eye.

00:45:44.120 --> 00:45:45.120
 Yeah.

00:45:45.120 --> 00:45:46.120
 And maybe...

00:45:46.120 --> 00:45:49.360
 You take a gamble and not having removed someone's eye by force rather than the guarantee

00:45:49.360 --> 00:45:50.360
 of having your own eye.

00:45:50.360 --> 00:45:56.680
 But that may be an inflated sense of my own generosity and pleasantness when drunk.

00:45:56.680 --> 00:45:57.680
 Well, yeah.

00:45:57.680 --> 00:46:01.200
 Because you and I went on a big night out, quite recently, Andy.

00:46:01.200 --> 00:46:02.200
 Didn't we?

00:46:02.200 --> 00:46:03.200
 We did.

00:46:03.200 --> 00:46:04.840
 How we were the last two men standing for the end of that night out.

00:46:04.840 --> 00:46:07.400
 And James, you've been missing three fingers ever since.

00:46:07.400 --> 00:46:08.400
 So hangovers.

00:46:08.400 --> 00:46:09.400
 Yeah.

00:46:09.400 --> 00:46:10.400
 Mmm.

00:46:10.400 --> 00:46:11.400
 They're not fun.

00:46:11.400 --> 00:46:12.400
 How they?

00:46:12.400 --> 00:46:13.400
 No.

00:46:13.400 --> 00:46:16.720
 And they're very damaging.

00:46:16.720 --> 00:46:21.480
 So on average, 200,000 British workers turn up to work hungover every day.

00:46:21.480 --> 00:46:25.920
 And I imagine in these days a lockdown more than that.

00:46:25.920 --> 00:46:30.320
 And there's been a couple of papers that have pointed out it's weird that not more research

00:46:30.320 --> 00:46:35.640
 has gone into it because it has a massive impact on the economy and on society.

00:46:35.640 --> 00:46:41.400
 That number of people being quite debilitating the ill on a daily basis is losing the country

00:46:41.400 --> 00:46:42.880
 a lot of money.

00:46:42.880 --> 00:46:46.560
 And I was reading one editorial in the current drug abuse journal, which says it's

00:46:46.560 --> 00:46:47.560
 really surprising.

00:46:47.560 --> 00:46:50.440
 We haven't come up with a cure because of these consequences.

00:46:50.440 --> 00:46:52.800
 And it speculates that there's probably ethical reasons.

00:46:52.800 --> 00:46:55.600
 So people basically think, a hangover is kind of your punishment.

00:46:55.600 --> 00:46:56.600
 You got drunk.

00:46:56.600 --> 00:46:59.280
 You can stop getting drunk and then not have hangovers.

00:46:59.280 --> 00:47:04.360
 But the journal points out that people assume a hangover's punishment that will prevent

00:47:04.360 --> 00:47:06.440
 similar drinking episodes in future.

00:47:06.440 --> 00:47:09.640
 However, there is no scientific evidence that supports this assumption.

00:47:09.640 --> 00:47:13.920
 Whereas during the hangover, people often state they will never drink again.

00:47:13.920 --> 00:47:15.480
 This has never been found to happen.

00:47:15.480 --> 00:47:16.480
 It's true.

00:47:16.480 --> 00:47:17.480
 That's true.

00:47:17.480 --> 00:47:23.000
 The way I like to look at it is you're kind of borrowing some fun from the next day, right?

00:47:23.000 --> 00:47:28.720
 So if you go out drinking on Friday, then you're borrowing some of Saturday morning's fun

00:47:28.720 --> 00:47:30.560
 and having it on Friday night.

00:47:30.560 --> 00:47:35.320
 So you have more fun on Friday, but then on Saturday, you just feel like not fun at all,

00:47:35.320 --> 00:47:36.320
 right?

00:47:36.320 --> 00:47:37.320
 That's a really good way of looking.

00:47:37.320 --> 00:47:39.600
 Oh my God, that's an amazing way of thinking about it.

00:47:39.600 --> 00:47:45.360
 But that explains because I'm very keen on deferring gratification as far as possible.

00:47:45.360 --> 00:47:49.960
 Which probably explains why I'm not a very big drinker because I think, well, I'd rather

00:47:49.960 --> 00:47:54.960
 have no fun at all tonight in the hope of having lots tomorrow.

00:47:54.960 --> 00:48:00.780
 Well, what you could do is play the lottery, like a friend of mine does, where he buys lottery

00:48:00.780 --> 00:48:06.120
 ticket and then he doesn't look at it until the next week, until after the next week's

00:48:06.120 --> 00:48:08.040
 draw has been made.

00:48:08.040 --> 00:48:10.360
 And he's already bought next week's lottery ticket.

00:48:10.360 --> 00:48:15.080
 And what that means is that he always potentially has a winning lottery ticket in his

00:48:15.080 --> 00:48:16.080
 wallet.

00:48:16.080 --> 00:48:19.400
 So he's always got a potentially lottery winning ticket on him.

00:48:19.400 --> 00:48:20.400
 Yeah, exactly.

00:48:20.400 --> 00:48:26.040
 Is he a happy man or is he a bit weird?

00:48:26.040 --> 00:48:27.040
 Is you, isn't it?

00:48:27.040 --> 00:48:28.040
 It's him.

00:48:28.040 --> 00:48:30.560
 Oh God.

00:48:30.560 --> 00:48:35.600
 I was reading about a pretty spectacular hangover that happened in China.

00:48:35.600 --> 00:48:41.280
 There's a guy called Jiang Wu, who was staying at a bed and breakfast in Qingdao.

00:48:41.280 --> 00:48:44.880
 He had fallen asleep in what he thought was his bed and breakfast.

00:48:44.880 --> 00:48:50.120
 It actually turned out to be a shipping container that was being loaded the very next morning

00:48:50.120 --> 00:48:53.680
 onto a cargo that was going to set sail for Los Angeles.

00:48:53.680 --> 00:48:57.200
 So he woke up inside the container.

00:48:57.200 --> 00:48:59.880
 He luckily had his phone on him, who was called as friends.

00:48:59.880 --> 00:49:02.120
 He couldn't get through to a bunch of people called the police.

00:49:02.120 --> 00:49:06.080
 Eventually, they worked out where he might be by tracking the phone.

00:49:06.080 --> 00:49:11.440
 And they found him in a stack of cargo containers that were reaching 60 feet high.

00:49:11.440 --> 00:49:13.480
 And they had to go through.

00:49:13.480 --> 00:49:17.440
 I'd log about, and if he'd not, if he'd not work enough, if it'd been a few hours later,

00:49:17.440 --> 00:49:21.280
 I think they said he would have been on his way to Los Angeles.

00:49:21.280 --> 00:49:22.280
 Oh my God.

00:49:22.280 --> 00:49:24.080
 It's a pretty holiday.

00:49:24.080 --> 00:49:31.880
 There's quality of Airbnb's in the city you mentioned, then, must be so low.

00:49:31.880 --> 00:49:35.520
 Maybe they have extremely luxury shipping containers.

00:49:35.520 --> 00:49:36.520
 Yeah, maybe.

00:49:36.520 --> 00:49:37.520
 Yeah.

00:49:37.520 --> 00:49:38.520
 No.

00:49:38.520 --> 00:49:42.680
 I actually have a favourite hangover that I've, I thought it's my favourite hangover for

00:49:42.680 --> 00:49:45.040
 a long time, and I'm so glad I get to share it.

00:49:45.040 --> 00:49:46.280
 It's Alexander the Great.

00:49:46.280 --> 00:49:48.640
 I think he had the best hangover of all time.

00:49:48.640 --> 00:49:49.640
 OK.

00:49:49.640 --> 00:49:55.440
 So this is in 330 BC, and one of his greatest conquests was he conquered Persepolis.

00:49:55.440 --> 00:49:58.640
 It was the Persian capital, and they've been building up to it for ages.

00:49:58.640 --> 00:50:01.560
 It's this huge, historic moment.

00:50:01.560 --> 00:50:04.920
 And it had a magnificent palace, or series of palaces.

00:50:04.920 --> 00:50:09.880
 And they had hundreds of years' worth of great Persian art and sculpture and writing

00:50:09.880 --> 00:50:10.880
 and lots of treasure.

00:50:10.880 --> 00:50:12.760
 It was the proper jewel of the empire.

00:50:12.760 --> 00:50:16.400
 So anyway, Alexander the Great storms in with his troops takes over this empire.

00:50:16.400 --> 00:50:18.720
 It's the capital, massive moment.

00:50:18.720 --> 00:50:23.400
 And then, so according to one account, everyone got really pissed, as you do, celebrating,

00:50:23.400 --> 00:50:25.600
 absolutely hammers.

00:50:25.600 --> 00:50:30.960
 And apparently, the drinking was far advanced, and Drunken Madness took possession of their

00:50:30.960 --> 00:50:31.960
 minds.

00:50:31.960 --> 00:50:35.880
 And then, according to various accounts, either Alexander and his assistance decided,

00:50:35.880 --> 00:50:40.760
 or this woman decided, who was one of their mistresses, decided that what they should

00:50:40.760 --> 00:50:43.720
 do is they should just burn the whole place down.

00:50:43.720 --> 00:50:49.200
 So she said, wouldn't it be really funny if you got us a bunch of women to burn down this

00:50:49.200 --> 00:50:52.040
 amazing Persian city that's taken so long to build?

00:50:52.040 --> 00:50:56.280
 And they giddy with wine decided that would indeed be absolutely hilarious.

00:50:56.280 --> 00:50:59.000
 And they burnt down the entire place.

00:50:59.000 --> 00:51:03.520
 And so I just love the added Alexander the Great woke up the next morning in his newly conquered

00:51:03.520 --> 00:51:04.520
 palace in the city.

00:51:04.520 --> 00:51:07.240
 And went, oh my god, what have I done?

00:51:07.240 --> 00:51:08.240
 Wow.

00:51:08.240 --> 00:51:09.240
 And that's it.

00:51:09.240 --> 00:51:11.200
 And destroyed the Great, and we'll never have that.

00:51:11.200 --> 00:51:14.000
 We'll never have the great jewel of that Persian empire.

00:51:14.000 --> 00:51:19.040
 They need to make that into a movie, a sort of historical version of the hangover, the movie

00:51:19.040 --> 00:51:23.520
 just to see what his 24 hours were opposed to that.

00:51:23.520 --> 00:51:24.520
 Wow.

00:51:24.520 --> 00:51:29.240
 The ancient cures are so much fun for hangovers.

00:51:29.240 --> 00:51:34.240
 So there was a big thing of wearing a wreath of flowers in your hair.

00:51:34.240 --> 00:51:38.000
 If you did that while drinking, doctors thought that had curative properties, and that you

00:51:38.000 --> 00:51:42.080
 might not get the hangover the next day, did they have to be specific flowers, do you think?

00:51:42.080 --> 00:51:45.360
 I think they probably would have been because that was a big thing, wasn't it?

00:51:45.360 --> 00:51:47.760
 You know, this will cure this and so on.

00:51:47.760 --> 00:51:51.200
 But we know that the treatises about this were written.

00:51:51.200 --> 00:51:55.000
 We just don't know what was in them because we just have references to them.

00:51:55.000 --> 00:51:58.120
 So we don't know exactly which flowers were for which drinks.

00:51:58.120 --> 00:52:00.040
 It's not very helpful, is it?

00:52:00.040 --> 00:52:01.040
 I know.

00:52:01.040 --> 00:52:02.040
 So lovely idea as well.

00:52:02.040 --> 00:52:05.880
 Everyone just in the pub is wearing a wreath of flowers on their head while they get

00:52:05.880 --> 00:52:06.880
 battered.

00:52:06.880 --> 00:52:07.880
 It was quite nice.

00:52:07.880 --> 00:52:14.560
 There was being boiled in a coffin and then buried in hay, which is less nice.

00:52:14.560 --> 00:52:16.400
 This is an alpine tradition.

00:52:16.400 --> 00:52:20.840
 I've read about it in this book, which I really want to get full of books, by a guy called

00:52:20.840 --> 00:52:22.880
 Shaunasi Bishop's Stool.

00:52:22.880 --> 00:52:27.120
 And he's written a book called "Hungover," the morning after, and "One Man's Quest" for

00:52:27.120 --> 00:52:28.120
 the cure.

00:52:28.120 --> 00:52:32.120
 And he basically went on this quest of getting drunk every single night in order that he

00:52:32.120 --> 00:52:33.120
 could test out.

00:52:33.120 --> 00:52:39.400
 And he tried this one, which is traditional, where you lie in this wooden coffin in a dark

00:52:39.400 --> 00:52:45.460
 room and you shut in, and then this lady scoops boiling water into it till you're really hot,

00:52:45.460 --> 00:52:49.240
 and then you get lifted out and chucked into a massive pile of hay and then covered up

00:52:49.240 --> 00:52:50.240
 with hay.

00:52:50.240 --> 00:52:52.480
 And then she digs you out and you're good to go.

00:52:52.480 --> 00:52:54.520
 I swear for tries, isn't it?

00:52:54.520 --> 00:52:55.520
 Is it for tries?

00:52:55.520 --> 00:52:57.920
 Does he report what it's like?

00:52:57.920 --> 00:52:58.920
 Did it work?

00:52:58.920 --> 00:53:03.840
 Because he felt sort of euphoric afterwards, but he didn't actually seem to say that it

00:53:03.840 --> 00:53:09.400
 definitely worked, but he did come up with a hangover cure in this book, and I trust this

00:53:09.400 --> 00:53:12.920
 more than anything, because no one's come up with a proper hangover cure, except this guy

00:53:12.920 --> 00:53:19.240
 who said, "The only solution to the proper hangover symptoms of nausea and headache, basically."

00:53:19.240 --> 00:53:22.540
 So we don't really care about tiredness and stuff, that's just like snap out of it, have

00:53:22.540 --> 00:53:23.540
 a coffee.

00:53:23.540 --> 00:53:28.040
 But nausea and headache, before you go to sleep, take milk thistle for your liver and

00:53:28.040 --> 00:53:33.480
 then you take an amino acid called enacetylcystine, apparently, which is inhaled as mist.

00:53:33.480 --> 00:53:35.900
 I looked it up, you can inhale it as mist, right?

00:53:35.900 --> 00:53:39.360
 Then take vitamins B1, B6 and B12 and some frankincense.

00:53:39.360 --> 00:53:40.360
 If you do that.

00:53:40.360 --> 00:53:43.120
 Well, we're going to get all this stuff.

00:53:43.120 --> 00:53:48.480
 I thought you might be growing it in your garden, I think it'd be easier for me to fight

00:53:48.480 --> 00:53:52.320
 a coffin, some hay, you're the Swiss lady.

00:53:52.320 --> 00:53:53.320
 Yeah.

00:53:53.320 --> 00:53:57.480
 Anna, I love the fact that in a time where we cannot buy tomatoes or pasta, you'll

00:53:57.480 --> 00:53:58.480
 recommend it.

00:53:58.480 --> 00:54:00.120
 People go out and get themselves some frankincense.

00:54:00.120 --> 00:54:07.160
 If you go to Tesco, the frankincense is completely empty at the moment, but you should be able

00:54:07.160 --> 00:54:11.400
 to inhale it as a mist, so just go and buy a packet of mist and your local shop.

00:54:11.400 --> 00:54:12.400
 Guys.

00:54:12.400 --> 00:54:19.640
 I just, there hasn't been as much of a run on mist as the house been on Exfer Institute.

00:54:19.640 --> 00:54:26.520
 Okay, that's it.

00:54:26.520 --> 00:54:27.520
 That is all of our facts.

00:54:27.520 --> 00:54:28.880

00:54:47.320 --> 00:54:48.760
 No such thing as a fish.com.

00:54:48.760 --> 00:54:49.760
 Do check it out.

00:54:49.760 --> 00:54:51.360
 We have all of our previous episodes up there.

00:54:51.360 --> 00:54:52.360
 It's a merchandise.

00:54:52.360 --> 00:54:53.800
 There's a lot of stuff to check out.

00:54:53.800 --> 00:54:54.800
 Do go.

00:54:54.800 --> 00:54:57.120
 Anyway, we'll be back again next week with another episode.

00:54:57.120 --> 00:55:01.000
 In the meantime, we do really hope that you're all doing okay, that your family's okay,

00:55:01.000 --> 00:55:02.000
 your friends are okay.

00:55:02.000 --> 00:55:03.240
 Please stay indoors.

00:55:03.240 --> 00:55:04.480
 We will get through this.

00:55:04.480 --> 00:55:07.640
 And thanks for continuing to listen to us throughout this whole process.

00:55:07.640 --> 00:55:09.480
 We'll see you again next week.

00:55:09.480 --> 00:55:09.840
 Goodbye.

00:55:09.840 --> 00:55:19.840
