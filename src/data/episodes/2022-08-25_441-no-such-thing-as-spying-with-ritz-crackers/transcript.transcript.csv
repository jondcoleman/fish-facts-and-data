00:00:00,00:00:04,"Hi everyone, welcome to this week's episode of No Such Thing as a Fish before we start."
00:00:04,00:00:10,"If you don't have plans in the next couple of weeks and you live in the Scottish area,"
00:00:10,00:00:16,"then you must come and see our show. We will be in Inverness, Aberdeen, Edinburgh and Glasgow"
00:00:16,00:00:21,between the 31st of August and the 4th of September and you will not regret it. It is
00:00:21,00:00:27,such a fun night with all sorts of facts and silliness and just messing around. There'll
00:00:27,00:00:32,be a prize for someone on the stage. I can't give you any more details about that. But
00:00:32,00:00:37,"if you're in Scotland and you'd like to come and see the show, then go to nosuchthingsafish.com/live"
00:00:37,00:00:44,"and the details are there. We also have a show coming up in Cardiff on the 13th of September,"
00:00:44,00:00:49,which I think is very nearly sold out if it's not already sold out and we have a show in
00:00:49,00:00:55,"London on the 9th of September. Now that is sold out, but you can see it virtually. So"
00:00:55,00:00:58,there are virtual audience tickets available for that and if you would like to get those
00:00:58,00:01:04,"or indeed the tickets for Cardiff, then again go to nosuchthingsafish.com/live. Thank you"
00:01:04,00:01:08,very much to everyone who's joined Club Fish in the last few weeks. We're having a whole
00:01:08,00:01:15,great amount of fun behind that velvet rope with loads of bonus material and ad free episodes.
00:01:15,00:01:21,"If you are interested in joining Club Fish, then do go to nosuchthingsafish.com/apple or"
00:01:21,00:01:27,"nosuchthingsafish.com/patreon for more about that. But as I always say in this situation,"
00:01:27,00:01:32,the main podcast will always always always be free and that free podcast is just about
00:01:32,00:01:36,"to begin. Okay, so on with the podcast."
00:01:36,00:01:56,"Hello and welcome to another episode of No Such Thing as a Fish, a weekly podcast coming"
00:01:56,00:02:01,"to you from the QI offices in Covert Garden. My name is Dan Schreiber, I'm sitting here"
00:02:01,00:02:06,"with James Harkin, Anna Tyshinski and Andrew Hunter Murray and once again we have gathered"
00:02:06,00:02:10,round the microphones with our four favourite facts from the last seven days and in no particular
00:02:10,00:02:16,order here we go. Starting with fact number one and that is James.
00:02:16,00:02:23,"Okay, my fact this week is that in the 1930 World Cup semi-final between the USA and Argentina,"
00:02:23,00:02:29,the American medic accidentally chlorophened himself and had to be carried off.
00:02:29,00:02:35,It's very funny and it raises for me a lot of other questions like who was he trying
00:02:35,00:02:42,to chloroform? Was it like a classic movie where the bank robber or whoever is trying
00:02:42,00:02:47,to steal someone puts the rag over them? Was he like holding his face?
00:02:47,00:02:52,There is so much wrong with this fact I think and we might go into all of it but it's basically
00:02:52,00:02:57,it's on the FIFA website so I think it counts as a fact for us but I can't see it mentioned
00:02:57,00:03:03,in any contemporary part and chloroform doesn't really work like that.
00:03:03,00:03:06,Incredible self-drive-by on your own face.
00:03:06,00:03:10,So he was called Jack Cole is that right?
00:03:10,00:03:13,And there are a few versions of events on there so one is that he ran on the pitch trying
00:03:13,00:03:18,to help another player and then a thing broke in his bag and he had chloroform in his bag
00:03:18,00:03:23,and then that broke and then the fumes were raised and knocked him out.
00:03:23,00:03:27,Another version is that he went on to the pitch to argue with the referee about something
00:03:27,00:03:33,and threw a bottle of chloroform onto the ground in anger and then it came up and a
00:03:33,00:03:34,fume stopped him out.
00:03:34,00:03:37,"That's a red card, that's a red card from the header."
00:03:37,00:03:42,The earliest I've managed to trace a story back is to a journalist called Brian Glanville
00:03:42,00:03:45,and a lot of people think he's the greatest football writer of all time he's really really
00:03:45,00:03:52,famous but he was born in 1931 so he couldn't have been at this match but it is on the FIFA
00:03:52,00:03:56,website but the other thing is if you look at contemporary reports from the newspapers
00:03:56,00:04:00,at the time it's not mentioned and I found an interview with Jack Cole which was done
00:04:00,00:04:03,about 15 years later and he doesn't mention it in that interview.
00:04:03,00:04:08,"You might not though, to be fair, he couldn't remember."
00:04:08,00:04:14,"It's amazing, the self-knockout is just phenomenal right, like it's one of those things where"
00:04:14,00:04:17,you don't know what to do when you see someone do it and Ash who wrote the theme tune for
00:04:17,00:04:22,"our song, he once was in a bar fight, it's very weird, exactly, you can't quite imagine"
00:04:22,00:04:23,it.
00:04:23,00:04:30,"He's so zen, so this was I guess just pre-zen, just pre-zen Ash and he went for the first"
00:04:30,00:04:33,"punch against these other people, he took the swing and as he took the swing he took"
00:04:33,00:04:39,"a step forward, slipped, fell on the ground, knocked himself out and that was end of fight."
00:04:39,00:04:40,Is that his only ever fight?
00:04:40,00:04:42,"Yeah, he KO'd himself on the first go."
00:04:42,00:04:47,So he actually has a 100% record of knocking someone out.
00:04:47,00:04:50,"One win, one loss in his only match."
00:04:50,00:04:54,Another source I found this is a book called Angels with Dirty Faces by Jonathan Wilson
00:04:54,00:04:59,which is the best book that I've ever read on South American football and he mentions
00:04:59,00:05:00,it in that.
00:05:00,00:05:04,"It's like such a big qualifier, like this is the best book I've ever read, is what they'll"
00:05:04,00:05:09,use on the camera.
00:05:09,00:05:14,"This generally, so we haven't really properly said, but 1930 World Cup was the very first"
00:05:14,00:05:19,ever World Cup and it was set up because the Olympics weren't taking football seriously
00:05:19,00:05:21,and they weren't having it as recognized as an official sport.
00:05:21,00:05:27,"So this was set up in South America, but as a result of that distance it meant that a"
00:05:27,00:05:31,lot of countries around the world didn't come and play because the journey there and the
00:05:31,00:05:35,journey back as well as the subsequent tournament would mean they were out of play for like
00:05:35,00:05:38,three months which didn't work with their local tournaments and so on.
00:05:38,00:05:41,Also expensive for a lot of countries.
00:05:41,00:05:46,"Also the home countries, so England, Northern Ireland, Scotland, Wales, they thought that"
00:05:46,00:05:51,actually really they were more important than FIFA and so they had their own kind of home
00:05:51,00:05:55,nations tournament and they didn't really see this as a proper World Cup so they weren't
00:05:55,00:05:56,in it.
00:05:56,00:06:02,So I read that the American team who were playing in this semi-final was mostly made up of English
00:06:02,00:06:04,and Scottish professional footballers.
00:06:04,00:06:05,"Mostly Scottish, yeah."
00:06:05,00:06:09,"I did account, I made it to be five Scottish players and one English player."
00:06:09,00:06:10,It's a lot.
00:06:10,00:06:11,It is a lot.
00:06:11,00:06:12,It's more than you're normally allowed.
00:06:12,00:06:13,I don't know.
00:06:13,00:06:14,I think.
00:06:14,00:06:18,"Well, and Col was Irish, I think, wasn't he?"
00:06:18,00:06:19,Yeah.
00:06:19,00:06:22,"In fact, he was Irish, brought up in Scotland and he'd just gone to America to track down"
00:06:22,00:06:26,"his father who'd run out on him and he found himself in America and they were like, ""God,"
00:06:26,00:06:27,are you from the British Isles?
00:06:27,00:06:28,"Yeah, would you mind playing for us?"""
00:06:28,00:06:29,Wow.
00:06:29,00:06:32,"But it's weird because America were quite good then, so I don't know why they had to"
00:06:32,00:06:33,poach.
00:06:33,00:06:37,This was like a heyday for American football and it sort of plummeted after this because
00:06:37,00:06:41,"of the football wars or the soccer wars, I think, where it's so unexciting."
00:06:41,00:06:43,It's the most boring war ever.
00:06:43,00:06:44,"Oh, okay."
00:06:44,00:06:46,It's like there were two bodies.
00:06:46,00:06:48,Everyone just clawed four of themselves.
00:06:48,00:06:52,"No, there were two bodies trying to manage football who were competing with each other."
00:06:52,00:06:57,"It was like the USFA and the ASL and they fought so much that everyone was like, ""Well,"
00:06:57,00:06:58,this is tedious.
00:06:58,00:06:59,"You're all arguing so much."""
00:06:59,00:07:01,"And the depression came, which didn't help."
00:07:01,00:07:06,"So, and the American team, they were known by the French as the shot potters because"
00:07:06,00:07:07,they were so big.
00:07:07,00:07:10,"They were like really big, strong players."
00:07:10,00:07:12,But they got battered in this game.
00:07:12,00:07:16,They lost 6-1 to Argentina and one of the reasons might have been because one of the
00:07:16,00:07:19,players got a broken leg in the first half.
00:07:19,00:07:21,I so don't believe this.
00:07:21,00:07:24,"Look, I've seen people with broken legs and it's really painful."
00:07:24,00:07:28,"It was guy called Ralph Tracy and apparently afterwards he was diagnosed with that, but"
00:07:28,00:07:31,"I reckon it was a tiny chipped bone, Max."
00:07:31,00:07:32,You're saying he played on?
00:07:32,00:07:33,Yeah.
00:07:33,00:07:34,He played on the whole game.
00:07:34,00:07:35,He got broken leg.
00:07:35,00:07:36,"Yeah, really early on."
00:07:36,00:07:40,"It was really weird because there was another player, Andy Old, who ripped his lip open."
00:07:40,00:07:41,Yeah.
00:07:41,00:07:44,And the problem was is that there were no sort of proper rules about how you could treat
00:07:44,00:07:45,the wound.
00:07:45,00:07:50,"And so, he played the rest of a match with a rag in his mouth to sort of stem the bleeding."
00:07:50,00:07:53,"Unfortunately, that rag had got chlorophyll on it."
00:07:53,00:07:54,Yeah.
00:07:54,00:07:59,"And so, basically, they were a good team, but they basically got beaten from pillar to post."
00:07:59,00:08:04,"And in the end, by the second half, they really were just hobbling around and the Argentinians"
00:08:04,00:08:05,absolutely battered them.
00:08:05,00:08:06,Yeah.
00:08:06,00:08:11,"I guess because it was 6-1 and America scored their goal in the last, in the 89th minute,"
00:08:11,00:08:12,I think.
00:08:12,00:08:13,Did they?
00:08:13,00:08:14,Yeah.
00:08:14,00:08:15,"Well, you think, kind of, what's the point?"
00:08:15,00:08:16,Why are you still trying at that point?
00:08:16,00:08:17,"No, that's great."
00:08:17,00:08:18,It's a bit of honor.
00:08:18,00:08:19,Yeah.
00:08:19,00:08:22,"In the final, which was Argentina versus Uruguay, Uruguay won that final."
00:08:22,00:08:25,"And in Argentina, they kicked off."
00:08:25,00:08:28,The Uruguayan embassy was attacked.
00:08:28,00:08:33,They did a morning parade through Buenos Aires and two people were reportedly shot for not
00:08:33,00:08:35,saluting as the parade went past.
00:08:35,00:08:37,"Oh, my God."
00:08:37,00:08:38,Amazing.
00:08:38,00:08:42,"The one newspaper said that since they'd lost Argentina, probably it meant that international"
00:08:42,00:08:47,"football tournaments were a bit useless, so they should just never do them ever again."
00:08:47,00:08:51,And eight players from that Argentinian team never played for the country ever again.
00:08:51,00:08:52,Wow.
00:08:52,00:08:53,Yeah.
00:08:53,00:08:55,"This feels like it's about, you know, in a marriage where you have a massive fight about"
00:08:55,00:08:56,where you keep the spoons?
00:08:56,00:08:58,"It's not about, not about the spoons really."
00:08:58,00:08:59,I don't think it's about the spoons.
00:08:59,00:09:02,I think it actually always is about where you keep the spoons because it's a very clear
00:09:02,00:09:03,place where they should be.
00:09:03,00:09:04,Yeah.
00:09:04,00:09:08,"And he's like to his wife, ""You've had an affair just like this about the spoons, isn't it?"
00:09:08,00:09:10,"Yes, it's about the spoons."""
00:09:10,00:09:16,"Yeah, there was a ref called John Langanus, and he's pronounced Longanus."
00:09:16,00:09:17,Longanus.
00:09:17,00:09:18,Sorry.
00:09:18,00:09:21,I imagine that's what the fans sung to him.
00:09:21,00:09:22,Yeah.
00:09:22,00:09:23,John Longanus.
00:09:23,00:09:24,Longanus.
00:09:24,00:09:25,"He was Belgian, right?"
00:09:25,00:09:26,Yes.
00:09:26,00:09:31,"And he was the head ref of the, I'd say he was the one who officiated the final."
00:09:31,00:09:36,"And he was really worried about the tensions running really high, as James says, like even"
00:09:36,00:09:37,post the match.
00:09:37,00:09:42,"So one of the Argentinian players, Luis Monti, he got a death threat sent, and the referee"
00:09:42,00:09:45,demanded a quick escape route to get back to his ship.
00:09:45,00:09:49,"He wanted, not a secret tunnel, but as near as damn it, a safe passage back to his."
00:09:49,00:09:50,Exactly.
00:09:50,00:09:51,Because he thought whatever call he makes.
00:09:51,00:09:54,So Longanus asked for a safe passage to him.
00:09:54,00:09:55,Yeah.
00:09:55,00:10:00,"So I mean, it did sound like it was a bit of an intense atmosphere, and there was a"
00:10:00,00:10:02,controversial goal in that final as well.
00:10:02,00:10:03,So yeah.
00:10:03,00:10:08,"Well, Luis Monti, for instance, he was like the hard man of the Argentinian defense, but"
00:10:08,00:10:12,"he did get this death threat, and afterwards there was a suggestion in the Argentinian"
00:10:12,00:10:17,media that it was one of the Uruguayan players who drank him up with a silly voice and said
00:10:17,00:10:19,he was going to kill him.
00:10:19,00:10:23,"But in the end, he still played, he didn't think he was going to play, but all the way"
00:10:23,00:10:27,"through, he would kind of try and ingratiate himself with the crowd."
00:10:27,00:10:31,"So whenever a Uruguayan player went down, he would sort of go and help them up and stuff"
00:10:31,00:10:32,like that.
00:10:32,00:10:34,"What, in the hope of the guy who was going to kill him, holding the revolver somewhere"
00:10:34,00:10:36,"in the crowd, thought, oh, he is a nice guy actually."
00:10:36,00:10:37,"After all, yeah."
00:10:37,00:10:38,Yeah.
00:10:38,00:10:40,I'll put it away.
00:10:40,00:10:44,"One of the other things about the crowd that was there, so it was 90,000 plus, but that"
00:10:44,00:10:50,"was only five days into the tournament because their main stadium, the Estadio Centenario,"
00:10:50,00:10:53,"was not ready in time, and because of the weather as well, were raining."
00:10:53,00:10:57,So there were two other smaller stadiums where they ended up going through as well.
00:10:57,00:10:59,"Yeah, it was the grass hadn't grown properly, right?"
00:10:59,00:11:03,"And so they thought that the studs would kind of dig it up, the cleats for American listeners"
00:11:03,00:11:06,would kind of dig up the ground.
00:11:06,00:11:07,Was this because of the weather?
00:11:07,00:11:11,Because one thing I read was that it had rained for 92 consecutive days before the first game
00:11:11,00:11:12,of this world cup.
00:11:12,00:11:13,"Oh, my God."
00:11:13,00:11:14,Wow.
00:11:14,00:11:15,92 days.
00:11:15,00:11:16,Imagine the state of their reservoirs.
00:11:16,00:11:17,Lovely.
00:11:17,00:11:18,"Yeah, gorgeous."
00:11:18,00:11:19,Lovely.
00:11:19,00:11:20,Very green lawns.
00:11:20,00:11:22,I could do it in 92 days of rain right now.
00:11:22,00:11:23,It's like that.
00:11:23,00:11:26,Do you remember that summer when Rihanna's umbrella was in the charts and it rained for
00:11:26,00:11:28,like three months non-stop here as well?
00:11:28,00:11:29,"Yeah, yeah."
00:11:29,00:11:32,So why the song did so well?
00:11:32,00:11:33,"There was a suggestion of that, yeah."
00:11:33,00:11:38,I remember it was like they had real problems at Wimbledon because they couldn't play any
00:11:38,00:11:40,of the matches because it just rained non-stop.
00:11:40,00:11:42,And is there a suggestion that Rihanna did some Cloudseed in May?
00:11:42,00:11:43,"Well, there is."
00:11:43,00:11:44,Wow.
00:11:44,00:11:45,I think the label did.
00:11:45,00:11:46,Yeah.
00:11:46,00:11:47,She probably didn't know about it.
00:11:47,00:11:50,"She flew the Cessna herself, hoping that..."
00:11:50,00:11:51,Chloroform.
00:11:51,00:11:52,Chloroform?
00:11:52,00:11:53,Yeah.
00:11:53,00:11:54,"No, thank you."
00:11:54,00:11:59,"I've got a sample here, and let's try it."
00:11:59,00:12:02,"That's enough of your chat up line, Simon."
00:12:02,00:12:09,"So, yeah, chloroform is really, really interesting stuff in that."
00:12:09,00:12:11,I just love the story of how it was first used.
00:12:11,00:12:15,It was first sort of properly introduced to surgery in the UK by a doctor called James
00:12:15,00:12:16,Simpson.
00:12:16,00:12:20,"And before that, they were using ether, but the dose is very hard to get right, and it"
00:12:20,00:12:23,"smells horrible and all of this, so chloroform was an improvement."
00:12:23,00:12:28,"And in 1847, Simpson had two other doctors who were called Keith and Duncan, their surnames,"
00:12:28,00:12:33,"I think, round to dinner, and he said, ""Look, I've got this stuff, do you want to try it?"""
00:12:33,00:12:38,"And they tried it, got lightheaded, laughed a lot, and then all just fell unconscious."
00:12:38,00:12:40,"And then someone came into the room, and they were just out."
00:12:40,00:12:44,"I imagine one of them went, ""Your surname's also a first name."""
00:12:44,00:12:45,"Yeah, exactly."
00:12:45,00:12:50,They actually had witnesses for the whole thing.
00:12:50,00:12:54,"It sounds like they had really fun parties, these guys, and they'd spent an entire summer"
00:12:54,00:12:59,"trying to find a better replacement for ether, so they'd spent an entire summer inhaling"
00:12:59,00:13:03,"various concoctions of gases around their dining room tables, sort of collapsing and"
00:13:03,00:13:05,having fits and stuff.
00:13:05,00:13:08,"And then they remembered that, ""I've got this thing called chloroform that a friend told"
00:13:08,00:13:09,me about.
00:13:09,00:13:10,"I think it's under some waste paper."""
00:13:10,00:13:11,Picked it out.
00:13:11,00:13:17,"They tried it, and apparently unwanted hilarity seized the party for a while, and their conversation"
00:13:17,00:13:20,was of unusual intelligence for a few minutes.
00:13:20,00:13:24,"The first woman who took it was actually at the party that night, because there were family"
00:13:24,00:13:28,and friends there who were finding them also charming and entertaining.
00:13:28,00:13:31,"And so once they'd sampled it a few times, the guests had to say, ""Well, can we ever"
00:13:31,00:13:32,"go?"""
00:13:32,00:13:37,"And she apparently gallantly took her turn and then fell asleep while crying, ""I'm an"
00:13:37,00:13:38,angel.
00:13:38,00:13:39,"I'm an angel."""
00:13:39,00:13:40,"Oh, okay."
00:13:40,00:13:44,"Actually, I think she wasn't the first woman to take chloroform."
00:13:44,00:13:45,"No, sorry."
00:13:45,00:13:46,Maybe it wasn't.
00:13:46,00:13:49,"So it had been discovered, it was discovered about three times by three different people"
00:13:49,00:13:51,in the same month or so.
00:13:51,00:13:54,"And I should say, a lot of my facts have come from a book called ""Cloroform"" by Linda"
00:13:54,00:13:56,"Stratman, which is great and rollicking."
00:13:56,00:13:57,Absolutely.
00:13:57,00:13:58,Knockout.
00:13:58,00:13:59,"Again, on the cover."
00:13:59,00:14:02,It's for the cover.
00:14:02,00:14:07,"So Samuel Guthrie was a doctor in Massachusetts, and he thought what he had was this thing called"
00:14:07,00:14:12,"Dutch liquid, which there was an existing recipe for, which involved chlorine and, you"
00:14:12,00:14:14,"know, chlorate ether."
00:14:14,00:14:18,"So he had made it, but he kind of accidentally distilled it one extra time, or there was"
00:14:18,00:14:20,an extra ingredient in the mix when he made it.
00:14:20,00:14:22,So he had chloroform without knowing it.
00:14:22,00:14:27,"But because he thought it was a known substance, which was already being used for medicine,"
00:14:27,00:14:31,he just kept some in his lab and would distribute bottles to friends and family.
00:14:31,00:14:36,"And his daughter, who was eight-year-old Cynthia, would often run into the lab, dip her fingers"
00:14:36,00:14:40,"in the liquid, taste it, and that was just a little treat for her."
00:14:40,00:14:44,"On one occasion, she took too much of it, and she fell over completely asleep."
00:14:44,00:14:45,"Oh, my God."
00:14:45,00:14:48,And so she was probably the first person to be knocked out by chloroform.
00:14:48,00:14:49,Wow.
00:14:49,00:14:50,What a claim.
00:14:50,00:14:51,Yeah.
00:14:51,00:14:54,"And Stratman writes, ""It is probable that he simply assumed she was drunk."""
00:14:54,00:14:56,"It's all right, everyone."
00:14:56,00:14:59,It's all right by eight-year-old's drunk.
00:14:59,00:15:01,She's not to self out with chloroform.
00:15:01,00:15:02,Don't worry.
00:15:02,00:15:03,And what do we use it for today?
00:15:03,00:15:05,Is it used still to put patients under?
00:15:05,00:15:06,No.
00:15:06,00:15:07,We use it for manufacturing.
00:15:07,00:15:10,I think it's used to make Teflon and some other stuff.
00:15:10,00:15:12,"It's a sort of primer ingredient for Teflon, yeah."
00:15:12,00:15:13,Right.
00:15:13,00:15:14,Yeah.
00:15:14,00:15:15,"But no, it sort of fell out of use."
00:15:15,00:15:18,It started falling out of use in the 19th century because people started to question
00:15:18,00:15:19,it.
00:15:19,00:15:20,It kills people.
00:15:20,00:15:21,"Yeah, sometimes."
00:15:21,00:15:22,"Also, I think it gets a bad press."
00:15:22,00:15:23,"Like, it kills."
00:15:23,00:15:27,"They did a massive study and found that it killed one in 2,500 of the patients that it"
00:15:27,00:15:31,"had been used on in the 19th century, which is not great, but it's not terrible for 19th"
00:15:31,00:15:32,century medicine.
00:15:32,00:15:33,"No, for 19th century."
00:15:33,00:15:37,And then there was another study which found it could like four in a thousand.
00:15:37,00:15:40,But I think the four in a thousand one was done in the Civil War when everyone was quite
00:15:40,00:15:41,injured anyway.
00:15:41,00:15:42,Right.
00:15:42,00:15:43,So you're not at your best.
00:15:43,00:15:44,Yeah.
00:15:44,00:15:47,"What a journey it's had, you know, in terms of its repurposed uses."
00:15:47,00:15:49,"Like if it was on, who do you think you are?"
00:15:49,00:15:53,"And you were like, your ancestor used to like kidnap people, you know, and then you're..."
00:15:53,00:15:55,Is that something to be proud of?
00:15:55,00:15:57,"Well, in movies, that's the classic thing."
00:15:57,00:15:59,It gets used to fumigate grain.
00:15:59,00:16:00,That's a fun...
00:16:00,00:16:01,Does it?
00:16:01,00:16:02,"Yeah, yeah."
00:16:02,00:16:03,It's a fun use of it.
00:16:03,00:16:04,It's been great.
00:16:04,00:16:06,It's from the great glory days of kidnapping and curing people in the Civil War.
00:16:06,00:16:11,"You know, like a farmer, now you're in like the cooking industry with Teflon."
00:16:11,00:16:15,"We don't know that anyone was really kind of kidnapped using it, right?"
00:16:15,00:16:17,Because it's really hard to use.
00:16:17,00:16:18,Yeah.
00:16:18,00:16:23,"We might have said this before, but basically you'd need the exact correct dosage."
00:16:23,00:16:26,Otherwise they would just feel a bit woozy or they would die.
00:16:26,00:16:29,You'd have to get the exact thing in between and also it would take around five minutes.
00:16:29,00:16:30,It takes minutes.
00:16:30,00:16:31,Did it even happen in movies?
00:16:31,00:16:32,Or is that one of those missing memories?
00:16:32,00:16:33,"Yeah, it does."
00:16:33,00:16:34,It happens in a Sherlock Holmes story.
00:16:34,00:16:36,"It happens in Dickens, I think."
00:16:36,00:16:38,"Or Wilkie Collins, I think, maybe?"
00:16:38,00:16:42,"That's weird, because Dickens' wife used chloroform to give birth."
00:16:42,00:16:45,"So Dickens was well into chloroform, right?"
00:16:45,00:16:49,"And it's in one of his books, and I can't remember which one it is, unfortunately."
00:16:49,00:16:53,"But it was in one of his books, but he doesn't call it chloroform because whenever the book"
00:16:53,00:16:57,"was sent set, it was before chloroform had been invented."
00:16:57,00:17:01,"So he talks about this kind of special thing which knocks someone out really quickly, but"
00:17:01,00:17:04,he doesn't specifically say it's chloroform because he was so into chloroform we're pretty
00:17:04,00:17:05,sure that's what he meant.
00:17:05,00:17:06,That's great.
00:17:06,00:17:10,"Like you say, it is quite hard to administer, and it does have this really dark Goldilocks"
00:17:10,00:17:13,"phase where it works, and then on either side it's a bit useless."
00:17:13,00:17:17,"But even so, there was this massive spate of crimes reported in the '40s as soon as it"
00:17:17,00:17:18,became popular.
00:17:18,00:17:19,1840s.
00:17:19,00:17:20,In the 1840s.
00:17:20,00:17:21,"Yeah, the '40s."
00:17:21,00:17:22,Sorry.
00:17:22,00:17:23,Sorry.
00:17:23,00:17:24,"Yeah, yeah."
00:17:24,00:17:25,I think you were seeing.
00:17:25,00:17:27,"When I say the '90s, I'm usually referring to the 1790s."
00:17:27,00:17:28,Yeah.
00:17:28,00:17:29,Yeah.
00:17:29,00:17:30,Yeah.
00:17:30,00:17:31,It was his club night.
00:17:31,00:17:32,How's it going then?
00:17:32,00:17:33,There's a lot of baroque music.
00:17:33,00:17:34,A lot of ether.
00:17:34,00:17:35,"A lot of fun, actually."
00:17:35,00:17:40,"But yeah, there were things, there were all these stories about, you know, a handkerchief"
00:17:40,00:17:44,"would be waved in the face of someone and they would collapse, or a lot of stories of women"
00:17:44,00:17:47,coming up behind men and putting a handkerchief to their face and then.
00:17:47,00:17:48,Women chloroforming men.
00:17:48,00:17:49,Yes.
00:17:49,00:17:50,Blow for equality.
00:17:50,00:17:51,I know.
00:17:51,00:17:52,"Score, right?"
00:17:52,00:17:57,"But there was one doctor, actually, who got so annoyed by all these stories by, I think,"
00:17:57,00:17:58,the 1850s or '60s.
00:17:58,00:18:02,"Because he said, this doesn't make any sense, it takes minutes and minutes for it to work,"
00:18:02,00:18:06,that he eventually soaked a handkerchief in chloroform and waved it in front of his aunt's
00:18:06,00:18:10,face until he was absolutely exhausted of shaking to prove that it couldn't do anything.
00:18:10,00:18:11,"Oh, that's great."
00:18:11,00:18:13,Has he proven that to his aunt?
00:18:13,00:18:16,"Maybe, though, I don't know the argument that came before that."
00:18:16,00:18:17,Yeah.
00:18:17,00:18:18,Some misgivings.
00:18:18,00:18:19,Yeah.
00:18:19,00:18:29,"OK, it is time for fact number two and that is Anna."
00:18:29,00:18:34,My fact is that there's a group of astronomers called Solar Wind Sherpas who drag their equipment
00:18:34,00:18:37,around the world to watch every single solar eclipse.
00:18:37,00:18:38,Wow.
00:18:38,00:18:41,I think these guys are so cool.
00:18:41,00:18:46,"They've been going since 1995, so they visited every single eclipse since then, eclipses"
00:18:46,00:18:49,"happened, total eclipses were talking, but I want to re-18 months."
00:18:49,00:18:56,"It was set up by this woman called Shadia Refai Habal, who's a scientist, and yeah,"
00:18:56,00:18:59,"they take all their equipment and they go and watch eclipses, and they want to see the"
00:18:59,00:19:04,"corona, which is the bit when you see a totality in an eclipse, you've got that little bit"
00:19:04,00:19:10,"of ring of light around it, and that's basically the stuff that the sun is emitting, and it's"
00:19:10,00:19:14,"always too bright, the sun, the rest of the sunlight is too bright for us usually to see"
00:19:14,00:19:15,it.
00:19:15,00:19:17,It's not bad for them to google corona these days.
00:19:17,00:19:23,"It was a struggle with the beer, but I think the last few years has made it a lot worse."
00:19:23,00:19:26,"And so how long they've been doing this, how long they've been trekking?"
00:19:26,00:19:27,Since '95.
00:19:27,00:19:28,Since '95.
00:19:28,00:19:29,Yeah.
00:19:29,00:19:30,That's 1795.
00:19:30,00:19:31,Yeah.
00:19:31,00:19:32,Wow.
00:19:32,00:19:34,"They're called umbra files as well, aren't they?"
00:19:34,00:19:35,There's shadow.
00:19:35,00:19:37,"They've got called coronafiles, eclipsaholics."
00:19:37,00:19:42,"Yeah, you don't want the coronafiles nickname catching on, you really want to shed that."
00:19:42,00:19:47,"I got these from the website BeingInTheShadow.com, which is an eclipse chaser."
00:19:47,00:19:48,So set that up.
00:19:48,00:19:49,Who's seen 12 now?
00:19:49,00:19:50,Cool.
00:19:50,00:19:51,You've seen 12.
00:19:51,00:19:52,That's so cool.
00:19:52,00:19:53,It's a lot.
00:19:53,00:19:54,People get really into it.
00:19:54,00:19:55,Yeah.
00:19:55,00:19:56,"You know, they see their first one."
00:19:56,00:19:57,"You think if you've seen one eclipse, you've seen them all?"
00:19:57,00:19:58,I know.
00:19:58,00:20:03,"I know the eclipsah files are going to come up now, going to throw some shade."
00:20:03,00:20:07,"But yeah, I would have thought they were all the same."
00:20:07,00:20:10,"You'd think so, but I guess it's such a unique event even for our soldiers."
00:20:10,00:20:12,"Well, obviously not if they've seen 20 others."
00:20:12,00:20:17,"No, I guess I mean like your first cocaine high, once you've done that, you know, some"
00:20:17,00:20:20,"people do, I guess, they do get addicted."
00:20:20,00:20:21,They really get addicted.
00:20:21,00:20:25,"They do say it's a kind of transformative experience and they just, wow, they need it"
00:20:25,00:20:26,again.
00:20:26,00:20:27,Yeah.
00:20:27,00:20:30,"Well, Matt Parker, a buddy of ours, who's friend of the podcast, Steve Mould, who was"
00:20:30,00:20:31,on last week.
00:20:31,00:20:32,They were in a group together.
00:20:32,00:20:37,"He goes chasing eclipses, sometimes on cruises with his wife because Lucy, his wife is an"
00:20:37,00:20:39,actual solar physicist.
00:20:39,00:20:42,"She looks at coronal mass ejection for her, for her livelihood."
00:20:42,00:20:46,"And actually, just speaking of them as a couple, there's a thing that gets done with"
00:20:46,00:20:47,eclipses now.
00:20:47,00:20:49,"So it's called Bailey's beads, right?"
00:20:49,00:20:54,"And that is an actual phenomena of, like a corona, but they're just really beads rather"
00:20:54,00:20:55,than a full circle.
00:20:55,00:20:56,Exactly.
00:20:56,00:20:57,So it looks like diamonds.
00:20:57,00:20:58,When the moon is over the sun.
00:20:58,00:20:59,When the moon is over the sun.
00:20:59,00:21:03,And it's to do with the fact that I believe because the moon obviously has bumps and lumps
00:21:03,00:21:04,all over it.
00:21:04,00:21:08,"It's sort of like when the final bit of the eclipse is covered, a little bit will come"
00:21:08,00:21:09,through a bit that's a bit lower.
00:21:09,00:21:14,"And so they look like little diamonds and people propose to their, you won't be able"
00:21:14,00:21:15,to see you being proposed to.
00:21:15,00:21:16,Oh yeah.
00:21:16,00:21:17,Good point.
00:21:17,00:21:18,It's a totality of an eclipse.
00:21:18,00:21:19,It's a totality of an eclipse.
00:21:19,00:21:20,I'm just not so distracting.
00:21:20,00:21:21,"I definitely say no, regardless."
00:21:21,00:21:24,You've only got six minutes to watch it.
00:21:24,00:21:25,"Well, wait a minute."
00:21:25,00:21:28,You can see people in the dark when there's a new moon or something.
00:21:28,00:21:29,You can still see people.
00:21:29,00:21:32,But I thought the whole point of a totality in eclipse was that you can't see anything.
00:21:32,00:21:34,You can't see a cost.
00:21:34,00:21:35,You can.
00:21:35,00:21:36,"It doesn't go pitch black, Andy."
00:21:36,00:21:37,Do you still remember the eclipse?
00:21:37,00:21:38,"There's still stars, for instance."
00:21:38,00:21:39,When there's a solar eclipse.
00:21:39,00:21:40,Yeah.
00:21:40,00:21:42,"It just goes quite dark, like a light night."
00:21:42,00:21:43,Do you?
00:21:43,00:21:44,1999.
00:21:44,00:21:45,We were all alive.
00:21:45,00:21:46,Oh yeah.
00:21:46,00:21:47,But I wasn't in Cornwall wherever it was.
00:21:47,00:21:49,I actually was in Cornwall and it wasn't that dark.
00:21:49,00:21:51,"It was quite dark, but you could make out someone proposing to you."
00:21:51,00:21:52,"If someone said, ""When are you marrying me?"""
00:21:52,00:21:53,I wouldn't be groping around.
00:21:53,00:21:54,Who says that?
00:21:54,00:21:55,There are so many possibilities.
00:21:55,00:21:56,Wow.
00:21:56,00:21:57,"Oh, okay."
00:21:57,00:21:58,I thought it wasn't really dark.
00:21:58,00:22:03,"Well, when there's no moon at night time, you can still make things out."
00:22:03,00:22:04,You can still make out like shadows.
00:22:04,00:22:06,I've got my phone torch on.
00:22:06,00:22:11,"Was that the thing when the, because the last, was it the last time a full eclipse was in"
00:22:11,00:22:12,the UK?
00:22:12,00:22:13,It was 1999.
00:22:13,00:22:14,Yeah.
00:22:14,00:22:15,Anywhere in the UK.
00:22:15,00:22:16,"I remember seeing footage of it, wasn't it?"
00:22:16,00:22:18,Lots of people were taking photos with flashes on their cameras at the time.
00:22:18,00:22:21,"It was just incredibly annoying, because, you know, obviously you're trying to see the"
00:22:21,00:22:22,wonder of the eclipse.
00:22:22,00:22:23,"Yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:22:23,00:22:27,"Yeah, you would have been the pain in the ass with a massive torch, right?"
00:22:27,00:22:29,I've lost my diamond ring.
00:22:29,00:22:35,"There was a big solar eclipse in North America in 2017, but at that time they had a load"
00:22:35,00:22:39,of monitoring stations and they were checking the bees in North America.
00:22:39,00:22:47,"And at the moment of complete pitch black, all of the bees went silent, apart from one"
00:22:47,00:22:48,bee.
00:22:48,00:22:49,What?
00:22:49,00:22:51,It was one bee who buzzed.
00:22:51,00:22:52,No.
00:22:52,00:22:53,And they don't know why.
00:22:53,00:22:54,They can't work out.
00:22:54,00:22:55,This is a Disney film.
00:22:55,00:22:56,I'm not fucking Eric.
00:22:56,00:22:57,Really?
00:22:57,00:22:58,It was not so funny.
00:22:58,00:22:59,That's amazing.
00:22:59,00:23:00,Just one bee didn't get the memo.
00:23:00,00:23:01,Yeah.
00:23:01,00:23:07,"One day, Galen at the University of Missouri says that maybe he was slow getting back to"
00:23:07,00:23:13,"the hive, or he was a bee with particularly good eyesight, who was affected by the eclipse."
00:23:13,00:23:14,That's so funny.
00:23:14,00:23:19,"There was a story about a squirrel going nuts as well during the eclipse, and I go really,"
00:23:19,00:23:20,really spitty.
00:23:20,00:23:22,"Sorry, I missed my own thing."
00:23:22,00:23:26,"And afterwards they were like, do squirrels go crazy in the eclipse?"
00:23:26,00:23:30,"Or was it just the fact that we only saw one squirrel, and we're basing all the knowledge"
00:23:30,00:23:31,now on that.
00:23:31,00:23:38,"So, on this point, there has been a study from 2020 titled Total Eclipse of the Zoo, which"
00:23:38,00:23:41,is all about how all the different animals in the zoo react.
00:23:41,00:23:43,Why does that work as a pun?
00:23:43,00:23:44,It doesn't rhyme with heart.
00:23:44,00:23:45,It's not a pun.
00:23:45,00:23:46,It's a reference to eclipses.
00:23:46,00:23:49,But it's a reference to the song.
00:23:49,00:23:51,"Yeah, it's a reference to the song, Total Eclipse."
00:23:51,00:23:52,Then it's a bad reference.
00:23:52,00:23:54,"If you're going to make a reference, make it a good reference."
00:23:54,00:23:59,"Total eclipse of the heart, but you take out the E, and then you just study deer."
00:23:59,00:24:00,That's good.
00:24:00,00:24:01,That's really good.
00:24:01,00:24:02,That is good.
00:24:02,00:24:04,"Well, they wanted, I think, a slightly broader remit for their study."
00:24:04,00:24:08,"Total eclipse of the heart, or the deer, and other animals."
00:24:08,00:24:11,"All sorts of animals, actually."
00:24:11,00:24:15,Warthogs anecdotally show no reaction to Total Eclipses.
00:24:15,00:24:17,Komodo dragons move around a bit more than usual.
00:24:17,00:24:18,OK.
00:24:18,00:24:19,Giraffes huddle together.
00:24:19,00:24:20,Oh.
00:24:20,00:24:21,Yeah.
00:24:21,00:24:22,That's so good.
00:24:22,00:24:23,Spiders dismantle their webs.
00:24:23,00:24:24,"Yeah, where is that?"
00:24:24,00:24:27,"Well, like one specific species of spider rights."
00:24:27,00:24:29,"Yeah, the orb waivers."
00:24:29,00:24:30,It takes it down.
00:24:30,00:24:32,Total eclipse of taking your web apart.
00:24:32,00:24:33,There we go.
00:24:33,00:24:34,It's closer.
00:24:34,00:24:35,It's lovely.
00:24:35,00:24:36,There you go.
00:24:36,00:24:37,Yeah.
00:24:37,00:24:38,Much closer.
00:24:38,00:24:39,"Oh, dear."
00:24:39,00:24:43,"There was a, from in August 2017, the, I think this is the eclipse that you were talking"
00:24:43,00:24:44,about.
00:24:44,00:24:48,"There was a story went round, which it turns out wasn't true, but it got picked up by everyone."
00:24:48,00:24:50,"We think it's, we think it's not true."
00:24:50,00:24:55,It's not confirmed entirely where a bunch of people were hospitalized because their eyeballs
00:24:55,00:24:59,were really hurting because they weren't able to get their hands on the proper glasses that
00:24:59,00:25:02,you would wear to use to look at the eclipse.
00:25:02,00:25:06,So instead they thought they'd put suntan lotion on their eyeballs and that would help.
00:25:06,00:25:07,"No, that's not true."
00:25:07,00:25:08,That's the story.
00:25:08,00:25:12,And it was reported by Forbes and Snopes tried to get to the bottom of it and they called
00:25:12,00:25:13,up all the places.
00:25:13,00:25:18,"They never heard back from the one lady who was quoted, who was called Trish Patterson,"
00:25:18,00:25:20,who gave a quote saying that this had happened.
00:25:20,00:25:21,So it's inconclusive.
00:25:21,00:25:22,Because people have sunglasses.
00:25:22,00:25:23,"I mean, that's the thing."
00:25:23,00:25:27,"Most people didn't have sunglasses at the point, but I mean, normal sunglasses, not"
00:25:27,00:25:29,"special sunglasses, because I know you can't get special."
00:25:29,00:25:31,Are they lined with a particular crevium?
00:25:31,00:25:32,"Yeah, they are."
00:25:32,00:25:34,"But that's Andy says, you would have thought before you go to the suntan lotion on the"
00:25:34,00:25:37,"eyeball, you would go prepare sunglasses, like an ordinary pair of sunglasses."
00:25:37,00:25:40,"Yeah, but you might just be out in the beach that day or whatever."
00:25:40,00:25:41,You've got your suntan lotion.
00:25:41,00:25:42,You haven't got access to glasses.
00:25:42,00:25:46,"You've forgotten as a solar eclipse, I think you're going to someone said you could use"
00:25:46,00:25:48,a Ritz cracker because there's little holes in the Ritz cracker.
00:25:48,00:25:51,"So if you hold two Ritz crackers to your eyes, I don't think that works either."
00:25:51,00:25:52,Does it?
00:25:52,00:25:53,"No, it's ultraviolet."
00:25:53,00:25:56,Because it will still let the sunlight onto your retina to burn it.
00:25:56,00:26:00,I think you might be able to hold a Ritz cracker and then put a sheet of paper behind it.
00:26:00,00:26:02,And I reckon you'd see the...
00:26:02,00:26:05,"Because then the image of the sun appears on the paper, but don't put the cracker over"
00:26:05,00:26:06,your eyes.
00:26:06,00:26:09,"Well, look lots to test out when the next solar eclipse happens."
00:26:09,00:26:12,"I never thought of using a Ritz cracker for stuff like that, though."
00:26:12,00:26:15,"You could spy on people with a Ritz cracker or like, you know, when they have newspapers"
00:26:15,00:26:16,"on a bench in a park, a spy."
00:26:16,00:26:18,So I'm just holding up a Ritz cracker.
00:26:18,00:26:22,"I think the idea is that you think someone's reading the newspaper, which is a completely"
00:26:22,00:26:27,"normal thing that someone might do, whereas putting two Ritz crackers over your eyes is"
00:26:27,00:26:30,going to automatically arouse suspicion.
00:26:30,00:26:33,You'd have to spend years normalizing that activity.
00:26:33,00:26:36,And there could be a really fun viral ad campaign Ritz crackers did.
00:26:36,00:26:37,Like the Ice Bucket Challenge.
00:26:37,00:26:38,"Yeah, yeah."
00:26:38,00:26:39,You've got wits putting Ritz crackers over your eyes.
00:26:39,00:26:40,Yes.
00:26:40,00:26:41,Everyone does it.
00:26:41,00:26:42,Get Ritzy.
00:26:42,00:26:43,Yeah.
00:26:43,00:26:46,And then it's all part of the long game for that bench moment.
00:26:46,00:26:51,If anyone from Ritz crackers is listening or am I six or please do get in touch.
00:26:51,00:26:56,It's unlikely brand partnership in history.
00:26:56,00:27:03,"So another famous eclipse chaser is Cecilia Payne Gaposchkin in 1919, when she was 19"
00:27:03,00:27:07,"years old, she went on a solar eclipse expedition to Africa."
00:27:07,00:27:10,She later became the first woman to chair a Harvard department.
00:27:10,00:27:15,So she's a very famous academic and she is a person who proved what stars are made of
00:27:15,00:27:18,by spectroscopy of the light emitted.
00:27:18,00:27:23,"So she worked out that it's made of helium and hydrogen, mostly all the stars, the sun"
00:27:23,00:27:24,and all stars.
00:27:24,00:27:29,But we only found that out when she was in the early 20th century.
00:27:29,00:27:30,"Oh, early 20th century."
00:27:30,00:27:31,Yeah.
00:27:31,00:27:32,"So before that, they thought it must be made of metal."
00:27:32,00:27:38,Some kind of maybe some meteorites are flying into the sun and that metal kind of burns
00:27:38,00:27:39,and burns and burns.
00:27:39,00:27:40,That's what they thought.
00:27:40,00:27:44,"Anyway, she worked out that it was made of mostly hydrogen and she wrote this paper about"
00:27:44,00:27:49,"it, but everyone thought it was obviously bullshit."
00:27:49,00:27:53,How on earth could that possibly be true that the stars are made of hydrogen and helium?
00:27:53,00:27:59,"And so when she wrote her thesis at the very end, she wrote, this result is almost certainly"
00:27:59,00:28:00,not real.
00:28:00,00:28:01,What?
00:28:01,00:28:02,"Oh, no."
00:28:02,00:28:04,Because she wants to protect her career.
00:28:04,00:28:07,"She thought that if she did this, yeah, she didn't back herself."
00:28:07,00:28:10,"And it would be another 10, 20 years before people realized that that was true."
00:28:10,00:28:11,That's terrible.
00:28:11,00:28:14,"Well, all you're hedging your bets and cheating, guys."
00:28:14,00:28:18,"You can't say, oh, here's what I definitely think, except I may be just joking."
00:28:18,00:28:21,Have you guys heard of Donald Liebenberg?
00:28:21,00:28:22,Donald Liebenberg.
00:28:22,00:28:23,No.
00:28:23,00:28:28,"From Clemson University in South Carolina, a very well-established umbra file, eclipse"
00:28:28,00:28:29,a holic.
00:28:29,00:28:30,Okay.
00:28:30,00:28:31,Call him what you will.
00:28:31,00:28:32,Nerd.
00:28:32,00:28:36,So he's not seen more eclipses than anyone else.
00:28:36,00:28:40,"There is a group of people who, as of 2017, had seen 33 each and they were the front runners,"
00:28:40,00:28:41,which is a lot.
00:28:41,00:28:46,"Oh, do you reckon there's going to be like a murder mystery where they all knock each"
00:28:46,00:28:51,"other off so that one person has the most or there's another eclipse, but it's a difficult"
00:28:51,00:28:56,"place and they all stop each other from getting there and like it's a mad, mad, mad, mad world."
00:28:56,00:28:57,"Oh, yeah."
00:28:57,00:28:58,Yeah.
00:28:58,00:28:59,This is great.
00:28:59,00:29:00,Yeah.
00:29:00,00:29:01,"Anyway, Liebenberg, he's, okay, riddle me this."
00:29:01,00:29:03,He's not seen the most eclipses in the world.
00:29:03,00:29:09,"He's only seen 26, but he's spent more time in the totality of eclipse than anyone else."
00:29:09,00:29:12,"Even though other people have seen several more than him, yes."
00:29:12,00:29:13,How can it be?
00:29:13,00:29:15,Is he a pilot?
00:29:15,00:29:18,"No, but you're so close to the right."
00:29:18,00:29:19,Was he on a plane?
00:29:19,00:29:20,Hostess.
00:29:20,00:29:21,He's an ass.
00:29:21,00:29:22,"Yes, yes."
00:29:22,00:29:26,"No, for the 1973 eclipse, which is on June 30th of that year, there was a group of eclipse"
00:29:26,00:29:32,experts who got on Concord and they followed the path of it and they experienced 74 minutes
00:29:32,00:29:34,of total eclipse at a thousand miles an hour.
00:29:34,00:29:35,Crazy.
00:29:35,00:29:36,How cool is that?
00:29:36,00:29:37,It is cool.
00:29:37,00:29:38,You've got too much money.
00:29:38,00:29:41,"How did they see where they were going, Andy?"
00:29:41,00:29:42,Surely.
00:29:42,00:29:46,"Obviously, the plane had a torch on its front and planes have headlights, you know."
00:29:46,00:29:53,"But to me, right, the whole point of an eclipse is it's over in like six minutes, right?"
00:29:53,00:29:54,Yeah.
00:29:54,00:29:58,It's like it's bright and then the six minutes of weirdness and then it's bright again.
00:29:58,00:30:02,"If you're going for 74 minutes, you might as well just fly at night time."
00:30:02,00:30:03,Exactly.
00:30:03,00:30:05,But I think things might stay weird and get really weird.
00:30:05,00:30:06,79.
00:30:06,00:30:13,So you're going to replenish the suntan on your eyeballs.
00:30:13,00:30:18,"I was wondering about the glasses for people who can get hold of them, the special ones."
00:30:18,00:30:25,And I found out that there's a company called American Paper Optics who are the main producers
00:30:25,00:30:29,of them in America and their revenue doubles in years of solar eclipses.
00:30:29,00:30:30,Wait a minute.
00:30:30,00:30:31,A lot of people buy it.
00:30:31,00:30:33,Do you think it would more than double?
00:30:33,00:30:34,You would.
00:30:34,00:30:38,You think it would be an enormous spike in those years and quite leaving the other years.
00:30:38,00:30:43,"They make other types of glasses as well, right?"
00:30:43,00:30:45,They make 3D glasses.
00:30:45,00:30:50,"So most of their customers, you know, when you get a 3D cinema or you sell them in cereal"
00:30:50,00:30:55,packets or they're mostly freebies that they hand out so they get branding deals with companies.
00:30:55,00:30:59,"But in like in 2017, for instance, their revenue went from seven million to 14 million dollars."
00:30:59,00:31:00,That's doubling.
00:31:00,00:31:01,And that's doubling.
00:31:01,00:31:03,That's what doubling is.
00:31:03,00:31:06,And they've prepared for two and a half years for the 2017 eclipses.
00:31:06,00:31:09,They doubled their stuff and the guy who runs...
00:31:09,00:31:12,"Well, they could afford to, couldn't they, with all that double revenue they were counting"
00:31:12,00:31:13,on?
00:31:13,00:31:14,It works out perfectly.
00:31:14,00:31:15,That's good projection.
00:31:15,00:31:20,And the guy who runs the company is a guy called John Gerrit who seems to be really obsessed
00:31:20,00:31:21,with eclipses.
00:31:21,00:31:26,He actually got his big glasses break in the cardboard glasses world in 1991 when this
00:31:26,00:31:28,"astronomer got in touch and said, ""There's going to be an eclipse."
00:31:28,00:31:29,"Can you make some glasses for me?"""
00:31:29,00:31:33,I hear that you make cardboard glasses.
00:31:33,00:31:34,And it ended up being a massive deal.
00:31:34,00:31:41,And he sold a million glasses to Corona Beer in 1991 when the eclipse was in Mexico.
00:31:41,00:31:46,"And I think it must be that Corona, because of the Corona and the Corona, perfect partnership."
00:31:46,00:31:47,Genius.
00:31:47,00:31:48,Brilliant.
00:31:48,00:31:49,That's very good.
00:31:49,00:31:50,Yeah.
00:31:50,00:31:54,"There was, you know, we spoke about solar eclipses not on a podcast, but on a book."
00:31:54,00:31:56,"2017, our book of the year."
00:31:56,00:32:01,"We had literally our scripted conversation in there and there's a great fact in there,"
00:32:01,00:32:07,"which is that NASA has two accounts, which is NASA Moon and at NASA Sun."
00:32:07,00:32:13,"And on the day of the eclipse, NASA Moon blocked NASA Sun on Twitter."
00:32:13,00:32:14,Yeah.
00:32:14,00:32:15,Brilliant.
00:32:15,00:32:16,Okay.
00:32:16,00:32:22,It is time for fact number three.
00:32:22,00:32:23,And that is my fact.
00:32:23,00:32:27,"My fact this week is that in 1906, there was a music streaming service which involved"
00:32:27,00:32:33,just two people playing keyboards down the telephone.
00:32:33,00:32:38,So would I ring up and I'd immediately get piano music played at me?
00:32:38,00:32:39,You would.
00:32:39,00:32:40,Yeah.
00:32:40,00:32:41,"So this was someone waiting for a call, basically."
00:32:41,00:32:45,"And whenever the phone rang, they'd have to answer it and start playing piano at me."
00:32:45,00:32:46,No.
00:32:46,00:32:50,This is phenomenal when you think about the sort of the scale of what this person had
00:32:50,00:32:51,built.
00:32:51,00:32:56,So this was a lawyer called Thaddeus Cahill and he's 1867 to 1934.
00:32:56,00:33:02,"And at the end of the 1800s, he decides he wants to invent a machine whereby if you called"
00:33:02,00:33:07,"up this one phone number, you would get music just streaming to you."
00:33:07,00:33:08,And it was a subscription model.
00:33:08,00:33:11,So he was going to sell it to hotels and restaurants and so on.
00:33:11,00:33:15,What you would do is you would hold a paper funnel to the phone receiver.
00:33:15,00:33:19,So that would act as your amplifier to the room that you were playing it out to.
00:33:19,00:33:24,And I think in answer to your question that they would be just playing Bach or whatever
00:33:24,00:33:27,"and whenever you phone them up, you would get whatever they're playing at the time."
00:33:27,00:33:29,"So if they're playing chopsticks, you get chopsticks."
00:33:29,00:33:34,"So he basically invented the concept of music, sort of background music that can just be"
00:33:34,00:33:35,playing.
00:33:35,00:33:41,"But he, to do this, he invented a machine which was called the Telharmonium, which was"
00:33:41,00:33:47,"as big as the office space that we're in right now, a ginormous room in Manhattan."
00:33:47,00:33:51,"Can I just say, Dan, sorry to interrupt, but people at home don't know what the QI office"
00:33:51,00:33:52,is like.
00:33:52,00:33:56,I think at the moment they're imagining like an aircraft hanger or something.
00:33:56,00:33:57,We now have clips on YouTube.
00:33:57,00:33:58,You can watch it.
00:33:58,00:33:59,You're so right.
00:33:59,00:34:00,It weighed 200 tons.
00:34:00,00:34:01,It weighed 200 tons.
00:34:01,00:34:04,And it was 60 feet long.
00:34:04,00:34:07,So it's actually significantly longer than the bit of the office that you can currently
00:34:07,00:34:09,see now if you are watching on YouTube.
00:34:09,00:34:10,Yes.
00:34:10,00:34:11,Yeah.
00:34:11,00:34:13,"A picture, more feet the other way from the video."
00:34:13,00:34:19,They had all these phone lines that would be hanging in front of basically a ginormous
00:34:19,00:34:23,"gramophone horn, which was the music as what was being pumped through."
00:34:23,00:34:27,"I mean, it's very complicated to get your head around what this machine was, but effectively"
00:34:27,00:34:29,what Cahill had invented was the first synthesizer.
00:34:29,00:34:31,It was electronic music.
00:34:31,00:34:35,I love the way of explaining how complicated all the wires were and stuff.
00:34:35,00:34:41,The Republican and Herald newspaper in Pennsylvania in 1907 started off explaining how it works
00:34:41,00:34:45,"and then said, ""It would be useless to describe the more complex principles of the Telharmonium"
00:34:45,00:34:48,"because it would require diagrams and mathematics."""
00:34:48,00:34:49,I'm with him.
00:34:49,00:34:51,It really tells I want to dance relatively.
00:34:51,00:34:52,Yeah.
00:34:52,00:34:55,What's the surname of that?
00:34:55,00:34:56,Yeah.
00:34:56,00:35:01,"So this was in Manhattan, as I say, it was located on Broadway in 39th Street."
00:35:01,00:35:03,It took up an entire floor of the building.
00:35:03,00:35:05,He called it the Telharmonic Hall.
00:35:05,00:35:07,He also called it the Music Plant.
00:35:07,00:35:12,"And he advertised it as the music of AD 2000, which is really cool, really sci-fi."
00:35:12,00:35:16,He knew he was onto something that was kind of looking into the future.
00:35:16,00:35:18,"Now, there's no radio at this point."
00:35:18,00:35:24,This guy is decades ahead of any other kind of broadcasting of just playing music out.
00:35:24,00:35:29,"And there was a rumor that this was all generated, this music, by two people who would supposedly"
00:35:29,00:35:30,play for 24 hours.
00:35:30,00:35:34,"That was said in passing in an article, so there's no confirmation on that."
00:35:34,00:35:35,It might appear.
00:35:35,00:35:37,"Yeah, but the music was being played by people."
00:35:37,00:35:42,"And supposedly, this is where I get confused, could emulate sounds like the flute, or-"
00:35:42,00:35:43,"Well, it was electronic."
00:35:43,00:35:45,That was why it was so amazing.
00:35:45,00:35:46,"Yeah, but how?"
00:35:46,00:35:47,Did they record the-
00:35:47,00:35:48,"No, no."
00:35:48,00:35:49,You add...
00:35:49,00:35:50,"So I thought this was really interesting, because I've never known how, like, when you"
00:35:50,00:35:53,"get an electric keyboard and you press a button that plays a symbol or whatever, how"
00:35:53,00:35:54,do they do it?
00:35:54,00:35:57,And it's basically just you add lots of harmonics to one tone.
00:35:57,00:36:01,"So another amazing thing about this is it wasn't a normal musical instrument, it was"
00:36:01,00:36:02,an electronic instrument.
00:36:02,00:36:06,"So I think if you stood next to it, I'm not quite sure how the gramophone horn bit works."
00:36:06,00:36:09,"If you stood next to it, you couldn't hear it play, I don't think."
00:36:09,00:36:13,"You could only hear it play when the electrical signals were transmitted through cables, and"
00:36:13,00:36:16,they were interpreted into sound at the other side.
00:36:16,00:36:20,"And the electrical signals through this very complex system, you could overlay lots of"
00:36:20,00:36:23,"different notes on top of each other, so you'd have, like, the main note."
00:36:23,00:36:26,"But then they worked out that the reason a trumpet sounds different to, like, a violin"
00:36:26,00:36:31,"is because there are kind of, like, harmonic sounds overlaying that main note."
00:36:31,00:36:32,That's insane.
00:36:32,00:36:33,It is unbelievable.
00:36:33,00:36:34,I'd love to know how realistic it was.
00:36:34,00:36:35,Wow.
00:36:35,00:36:39,"I mean, it is that on top of what Anna's saying, there's quite a lot more, but it would be"
00:36:39,00:36:42,kind of difficult to explain without mathematics in the program.
00:36:42,00:36:46,So we probably won't go into all that stuff now.
00:36:46,00:36:48,And we don't have any recordings.
00:36:48,00:36:49,This is the other thing.
00:36:49,00:36:50,And it doesn't exist.
00:36:50,00:36:51,And it doesn't exist anymore.
00:36:51,00:36:52,And it doesn't exist anymore.
00:36:52,00:36:53,It was all for scrap.
00:36:53,00:36:54,It's incredibly tragic.
00:36:54,00:36:55,And there were complaints as well.
00:36:55,00:36:59,So it interrupted other transmissions at various points.
00:36:59,00:37:00,Yes.
00:37:00,00:37:01,So many complaints.
00:37:01,00:37:03,"The US Navy complained that they had secret wireless transmissions, which they'd like"
00:37:03,00:37:08,"to hear, but they were getting Rossini overtures instead, thanks to the telemonium."
00:37:08,00:37:10,It interrupted phone calls a lot.
00:37:10,00:37:14,"I mean, that was one of the reasons that it didn't succeed in the end, was that there"
00:37:14,00:37:16,were just so many problems with it.
00:37:16,00:37:18,People would be on the phone and music would bleed in.
00:37:18,00:37:21,"And in fact, I read one newspaper article from the time saying it had almost broken"
00:37:21,00:37:26,up a marriage because a husband had called his wife to say he was working late in the
00:37:26,00:37:27,office.
00:37:27,00:37:30,But she heard the William Tell overture playing in the background.
00:37:30,00:37:34,"So of course said, bullshit you in the office, may you round at a concert."
00:37:34,00:37:38,Having sex to the William Tell overture.
00:37:38,00:37:46,"The US Navy one, I think, by the way, later on, I think in 1911, he worked with a guy"
00:37:46,00:37:51,called De Forest and they came up with a new system that was basically the teleharmonium.
00:37:51,00:37:55,"But instead of going through telephone lines, they would use radio technology."
00:37:55,00:37:59,"And it was when the US Navy was using radio technology as well, they would get that kind"
00:37:59,00:38:00,of thing.
00:38:00,00:38:03,"And there was a later bit of his grill where he was working on something else, where he"
00:38:03,00:38:04,was still.
00:38:04,00:38:09,And it must have been good because it did get good reviews.
00:38:09,00:38:11,So we don't have any samples of it anymore.
00:38:11,00:38:15,But Mark Twain basically said he would postpone his death just to hear it again.
00:38:15,00:38:16,Wow.
00:38:16,00:38:17,Yeah.
00:38:17,00:38:18,How comfortable was he that he could do that?
00:38:18,00:38:19,Exactly.
00:38:19,00:38:22,He just sounds like you're in a situation where someone's about to kill you and you're
00:38:22,00:38:23,"like, no, no, just one second."
00:38:23,00:38:27,I just want to listen to the William Tell overture one more time.
00:38:27,00:38:30,"A last, yeah, like a last meal, a last song."
00:38:30,00:38:34,"So he was quoted, he went to a recital basically, he was invited to go to one."
00:38:34,00:38:39,"And he said, every time I see or hear a new wonder like this, I have to postpone my death"
00:38:39,00:38:40,right off.
00:38:40,00:38:44,I couldn't possibly leave the world until I've heard this again and again.
00:38:44,00:38:50,"And so in 1907, at this point, the plan of Cahill was that he wanted to put it into places"
00:38:50,00:38:54,"like, as I said, hotels and restaurants, but he couldn't get it into people's homes."
00:38:54,00:38:58,And Twain managed to work out that he could get it into his home because of his celebrity
00:38:58,00:38:59,status and so on.
00:38:59,00:39:04,And so the Times reported that he was going to glory in the fact that he would be able
00:39:04,00:39:08,to rejoice over other dead people when he died in having been the first man to have
00:39:08,00:39:12,tellharmonium music tuned in his house like gas.
00:39:12,00:39:15,"Twain, Twain seemed really, really, really like it."
00:39:15,00:39:18,"He said he wanted street lights to be connected to it, which would play the funeral march"
00:39:18,00:39:21,during his funeral as his funeral procession.
00:39:21,00:39:24,"He seems quite obsessed with death, doesn't he Mark Taylor at the moment?"
00:39:24,00:39:25,"Yeah, yeah."
00:39:25,00:39:26,"He was getting elbow at this point, wasn't he?"
00:39:26,00:39:27,Yeah.
00:39:27,00:39:30,"He was annoying, making him in the afterlife immediately going, ""Yeah, in your face, I"
00:39:30,00:39:31,"heard the tellharmonium!"""
00:39:31,00:39:37,"Well, you do know that got dismantled after two years, don't you, and no one ever heard"
00:39:37,00:39:38,of it ever again.
00:39:38,00:39:39,What?
00:39:39,00:39:45,"So there was an earlier thing called the Teatrophone in 1881, and that played, it was in Paris,"
00:39:45,00:39:50,"and it was the theatre phone, and it transmitted music, but also some theatrical productions"
00:39:50,00:39:51,over the phone.
00:39:51,00:39:52,Cool.
00:39:52,00:39:53,"No, hang on a second."
00:39:53,00:39:54,Did phones exist in 1881?
00:39:54,00:39:55,"Yeah, yeah."
00:39:55,00:39:56,There were quite a few.
00:39:56,00:39:57,There was only one.
00:39:57,00:39:58,Yeah.
00:39:58,00:40:00,Now there were some in 1880.
00:40:00,00:40:01,"Oh, okay."
00:40:01,00:40:02,"Yeah, yeah."
00:40:02,00:40:03,When was it in the 1870?
00:40:03,00:40:04,Was that when Bell patented?
00:40:04,00:40:05,"Yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:40:05,00:40:06,"It was early, wasn't it?"
00:40:06,00:40:07,Yeah.
00:40:07,00:40:09,"Well, because people thought with the phone, weirdly, they thought the phone was going to"
00:40:09,00:40:12,"be used for mass entertainment, and they sampled this loads of time."
00:40:12,00:40:15,"So yeah, there was the 1881 thing."
00:40:15,00:40:19,"There was, I think the longest-running, most successful version of mass entertainment via"
00:40:19,00:40:25,"phone was the telephone newspaper, and this was in Hungary, and it was invented in 1893,"
00:40:25,00:40:31,"and it ran until 1944, and it was a subscriber service, and you just called it whenever,"
00:40:31,00:40:35,"and it started off just being a news service, so you called it, and they tell you the news."
00:40:35,00:40:41,"But then it was music performances, there were fun, new pop songs, whatever you played."
00:40:41,00:40:42,When was this?
00:40:42,00:40:43,"It was probably shows, 1893."
00:40:43,00:40:47,"So was it a live programme, or so you didn't request?"
00:40:47,00:40:51,"You had to tune in at, let's say, noon for the headlines, and if you missed the headlines,"
00:40:51,00:40:54,"you might get the column later on, or the crossword."
00:40:54,00:40:57,"Yeah, there was no record option, you can go to it later on."
00:40:57,00:40:58,That's brilliant.
00:40:58,00:40:59,That's incredible.
00:40:59,00:41:04,"Even in the 1920s, 10,000 people were signed up to the system in Hungary, where you called"
00:41:04,00:41:05,up to get your news.
00:41:05,00:41:08,"That's amazing, but do you remember when the internet first started, and it was through"
00:41:08,00:41:12,"telephone lines, and anyone was making a call, you couldn't use the internet?"
00:41:12,00:41:13,"Yes, yes."
00:41:13,00:41:15,"Well, it would be the same here, if someone was listening to the news, you wouldn't be"
00:41:15,00:41:16,able to make a call.
00:41:16,00:41:18,"That would be really annoying, wouldn't it?"
00:41:18,00:41:19,Yes.
00:41:19,00:41:20,Yeah.
00:41:20,00:41:25,"So the telephone wires were laid between Buckingham Palace and a bunch of concert halls in London,"
00:41:25,00:41:28,"so that the royal family, whenever they wanted to, could listen to a concert."
00:41:28,00:41:29,Cool.
00:41:29,00:41:32,"Without having to, because it was a bit lowering to go into a music hall, for instance, if you're"
00:41:32,00:41:37,"the Queen Victoria, you know, you definitely wouldn't go into a music hall."
00:41:37,00:41:40,"Even having a phone line laid to a music hall is, I think, a bit undignified."
00:41:40,00:41:43,"Wow, you are one of the snobs of the 1890s."
00:41:43,00:41:49,"If there's a raucous, naughty performance, maybe you can't see her getting naked as well."
00:41:49,00:41:54,"She's probably just enjoying the ""da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da"" as a great tune."
00:41:54,00:41:57,"But I guess if, yeah, it depends on the venues, I suppose, as in some venues, I'm sure we're"
00:41:57,00:41:58,very reputable.
00:41:58,00:42:00,There must have been some reputable music hall.
00:42:00,00:42:04,"Well, she wasn't doing a phone call to some sort of a pub in Soho."
00:42:04,00:42:07,"It was going to be a guinea minute for this phone call, ma'am, are you sure?"
00:42:07,00:42:11,"It wasn't a sex line, okay, but it was so that..."
00:42:11,00:42:15,She was saying Queen Victoria didn't have a sex line installed in Buckingham Palace.
00:42:15,00:42:18,"Not that we know of, but we can't be sure."
00:42:18,00:42:21,But it was for the slightly more improper performances that it wouldn't do to be seen
00:42:21,00:42:22,at.
00:42:22,00:42:23,Who knows?
00:42:23,00:42:24,That's so cool.
00:42:24,00:42:26,On music platforms these days.
00:42:26,00:42:32,"So obviously, huge music platforms, you know, like Spotify and things like that."
00:42:32,00:42:36,One growing and rapidly growing music platform is Peloton Bikes.
00:42:36,00:42:37,"Oh, yeah."
00:42:37,00:42:38,Yeah.
00:42:38,00:42:39,"Like, they've all got..."
00:42:39,00:42:43,They've got licensing deals and they've got their own in-house music department specifically
00:42:43,00:42:44,to license...
00:42:44,00:42:46,"Oh, do you mean Exercise Bikes?"
00:42:46,00:42:47,The brand Peloton?
00:42:47,00:42:48,"Yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:42:48,00:42:49,It's in...
00:42:49,00:42:53,"Not anyone in the TARDO France because anyone who's not in the lead, but it's in the main"
00:42:53,00:42:54,group.
00:42:54,00:42:55,They have to carry a big boot.
00:42:55,00:42:59,"Yeah, there's the yellow headphones and whoever's in the lead on the TARDO France gets to listen"
00:42:59,00:43:00,to the music.
00:43:00,00:43:01,"Oh, of course."
00:43:01,00:43:02,"Yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:43:02,00:43:06,"No, but the Prince, as in the musician Prince, dead now, but the Grateful Dead, confusingly"
00:43:06,00:43:12,"I think a lot of him is still alive, and Beyonce, they've all licensed their music specifically"
00:43:12,00:43:16,to Peloton for massive amounts of money because it gets used in the exercise classes.
00:43:16,00:43:19,So this is the forefront of streaming is Exercise Bikes basically.
00:43:19,00:43:22,"But it's not exclusive tracks, is it?"
00:43:22,00:43:23,"No, you can still get them on Spotify."
00:43:23,00:43:24,"Yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:43:24,00:43:25,You can.
00:43:25,00:43:29,"So in the early days, I think Peloton was just using a lot of the music in their exercise"
00:43:29,00:43:33,classes and obviously they're making money out of these exercise classes and I think
00:43:33,00:43:35,it was a big old fuss about it.
00:43:35,00:43:36,"Well, that's a big..."
00:43:36,00:43:40,"I mean, I think we've said that Guitar Hero with certain bands like Aerosmith were making"
00:43:40,00:43:44,more money from the licensing deal that they did for that than they would make on their
00:43:44,00:43:45,records.
00:43:45,00:43:46,"Yeah, that's a big industry now."
00:43:46,00:43:50,"Would you want to, I don't know much Grateful Dead, I know a bit of Prince and it's weird"
00:43:50,00:43:51,and I don't know if I'd want to cycle to it.
00:43:51,00:43:53,Beyonce can totally see the cycling...
00:43:53,00:43:56,"Yeah, she's really the queen of Peloton."
00:43:56,00:44:01,You can get Beyonce-themed classes specifically to do on your bike.
00:44:01,00:44:04,"And riding your bike, of course, gives you an amazing arse, which is what she already"
00:44:04,00:44:05,has.
00:44:05,00:44:07,So that's something to strive for while you're riding.
00:44:07,00:44:13,"I just see that from somebody who cycles a lot, by the way, and you basically cycle"
00:44:13,00:44:16,"every day and you're like, ""You know what, people who cycle amazing arse."""
00:44:16,00:44:18,"Oh, my God, that is rock hard."
00:44:18,00:44:22,I'm sitting on two boulders right now.
00:44:22,00:44:32,"Okay, it's time for our final fact of the show, and that is Andy."
00:44:32,00:44:37,My fact is that Australian Aboriginal people sometimes built objects specifically to arouse
00:44:37,00:44:39,the curiosity of emus.
00:44:39,00:44:45,"Well, it wasn't nice of them."
00:44:45,00:44:46,It was naughty.
00:44:46,00:44:48,"Well, it wasn't naughty either."
00:44:48,00:44:49,It was just a spicy.
00:44:49,00:44:52,"Well, as they say in Australia, ""Curiosity kills the emu."""
00:44:52,00:44:53,"Yeah, exactly."
00:44:53,00:44:58,"And it did kill the emu in this case, but the unborn emus in the egg."
00:44:58,00:44:59,That feels worse.
00:44:59,00:45:05,"Well, this is maybe the worst way I've ever introduced the fact of the show."
00:45:05,00:45:06,There are these things.
00:45:06,00:45:08,The emu crawlers and Aboriginal peoples were built them.
00:45:08,00:45:13,"They're cylinders of carved wood, and when you bang the end with the flat of your hand,"
00:45:13,00:45:18,it produces a sound which apparently is reasonably like the noise of a female emu.
00:45:18,00:45:22,"And this has to be a female emu as well because with emus, the male is the one who sits on"
00:45:22,00:45:26,"the eggs and nurses them towards, incubates them."
00:45:26,00:45:27,That's the thing.
00:45:27,00:45:32,"And so one hunter will hide in the bush playing this thing, making the noise of a female,"
00:45:32,00:45:33,banging away.
00:45:33,00:45:38,"And the male will say, ""Oh, a female emu,"" and go and explore."
00:45:38,00:45:43,"And then his colleague, the man in the bush's colleague, will steal the emu's eggs without"
00:45:43,00:45:46,"being pecked to death, and that is absolutely the name of the game when you're hunting."
00:45:46,00:45:48,And so then you've got a lovely emu omelet.
00:45:48,00:45:49,Feed four people.
00:45:49,00:45:51,Feed four people.
00:45:51,00:45:56,"And the other way it was used sometimes is to distract a mob of females, and you can"
00:45:56,00:45:59,move them to one place where you want them to go so you can shoot them.
00:45:59,00:46:03,So it was used by hunters sometimes as well.
00:46:03,00:46:07,"So I will say the father, in Andy's case, kind of had it coming because he was going"
00:46:07,00:46:09,"to cheat on the mother of his children, right?"
00:46:09,00:46:11,"Yeah, but you know what's happening at the same time."
00:46:11,00:46:16,"Like when a male emu is incubating the eggs, the woman's off shagging other emus."
00:46:16,00:46:17,It's true.
00:46:17,00:46:22,"And not only that, she shags the other emu, gets a baby in an egg, and then slips it under"
00:46:22,00:46:23,the other father.
00:46:23,00:46:24,Yeah.
00:46:24,00:46:25,It's all complicated.
00:46:25,00:46:26,There's no villain in this piece.
00:46:26,00:46:27,"Oh, no."
00:46:27,00:46:28,No villain.
00:46:28,00:46:30,"I thought the male was the villain a while ago, Anna."
00:46:30,00:46:32,"She can store sperm as well, right?"
00:46:32,00:46:35,Like multiple different sperm that she can then revert like this.
00:46:35,00:46:36,You've got to sort of larder.
00:46:36,00:46:37,I didn't know that.
00:46:37,00:46:38,I catch it.
00:46:38,00:46:39,That's what I read.
00:46:39,00:46:41,It sounds like Dan's saying there's a kind of cupboard inside the female emu.
00:46:41,00:46:42,That's kind of how it works.
00:46:42,00:46:43,Yeah.
00:46:43,00:46:44,But can she select?
00:46:44,00:46:47,I think he'll have a little bit of Tony today and then fertilize from him.
00:46:47,00:46:48,I don't think so.
00:46:48,00:46:53,I don't think there's a sort of like spice shelf for the difference.
00:46:53,00:46:57,"But the male doesn't eat or drink or defecate during the incubation of the eggs, which is"
00:46:57,00:46:58,56 days.
00:46:58,00:47:03,"I'm not going to judge him for hearing a female and thinking, ""Oh, I wonder..."""
00:47:03,00:47:07,"So he doesn't have time to poo, but he does have the chance to shag another female."
00:47:07,00:47:08,Yeah.
00:47:08,00:47:09,It's all about priorities.
00:47:09,00:47:10,"Yeah, isn't it?"
00:47:10,00:47:12,How appealing is he going to be to that female?
00:47:12,00:47:15,It hasn't showered in 50 days.
00:47:15,00:47:18,Bows on leash immediately.
00:47:18,00:47:23,"There's a slight advantage for the males, I think, when the females can bring other eggs"
00:47:23,00:47:28,"back and make him incubate them, even though they don't belong to him, because if he's sitting"
00:47:28,00:47:32,"on his own eggs, but also some other dad's eggs, if the eggs get attacked, at least it"
00:47:32,00:47:34,raises the chances that someone else's kids will be lost.
00:47:34,00:47:35,"Oh, okay."
00:47:35,00:47:36,That's pretty dark.
00:47:36,00:47:37,Yeah.
00:47:37,00:47:41,"I suppose one of the thing is, the first eggs to hatch will be his eggs, right?"
00:47:41,00:47:46,"Because he was the first one there, and that means that when all of the kids have hatched,"
00:47:46,00:47:51,"his will be the oldest and perhaps the strongest, so that might help as well."
00:47:51,00:47:55,"Because the male looks after the chicks for, I think, about seven months."
00:47:55,00:47:59,"It's a long old time that the male is doing the carry-off, and sometimes we'll take on"
00:47:59,00:48:03,other chicks which got lost from other broods.
00:48:03,00:48:04,"Yeah, right."
00:48:04,00:48:10,"This object that they make, if you can imagine a didgeridoo, it's like a small didgeridoo,"
00:48:10,00:48:16,"and it's sometimes known as a woman's didgeridoo, because it's a small version of it, and they're"
00:48:16,00:48:17,made in the same way.
00:48:17,00:48:23,"So they're not necessarily made by the humans, they're kind of naturally made by ants eating"
00:48:23,00:48:26,"out the middle of a trunk, and then decorated."
00:48:26,00:48:31,"And they do sound, if you listen to a didgeridoo, so I haven't heard what the emu cooler sounds"
00:48:31,00:48:35,"like, but I imagine it's a slightly higher-pitched version of a didgeridoo, they do sound a bit"
00:48:35,00:48:36,like emus.
00:48:36,00:48:41,"Like, the emu noise is very kind of like something grunting underwater, I thought, which is a"
00:48:41,00:48:47,"little bit like a didgeridoo, but it's not the only way to attract an emu if you're in"
00:48:47,00:48:48,the business.
00:48:48,00:48:49,Really?
00:48:49,00:48:50,Yeah.
00:48:50,00:48:51,It must be.
00:48:51,00:48:52,Myriad ways.
00:48:52,00:48:53,"Oh, God, there are a lot of ways."
00:48:53,00:48:54,Yeah.
00:48:54,00:48:57,Des Fallon called himself the world champion emu cooler in the '90s.
00:48:57,00:48:59,I can't find any official record of that.
00:48:59,00:49:04,"I think it might have just been self-styled, but he said, and this does work, and lots"
00:49:04,00:49:09,"of people do it now, you lie on your back and you wave your legs in the air, kind of like"
00:49:09,00:49:13,"a turtle that's been turned over, and you sort of make a noise like a strangled cat sort"
00:49:13,00:49:18,"of grunting noise, and halfway between it being in pain and being in love, I think one"
00:49:18,00:49:19,researcher said.
00:49:19,00:49:20,That's amazing.
00:49:20,00:49:23,"So that's a good version or take on that, which is that you lay on your back and you"
00:49:23,00:49:28,put one leg in the air with your foot in that position that it looks like it's an emu's
00:49:28,00:49:33,"head, and it confuses the emu into thinking it's another emu, and it comes over to investigate"
00:49:33,00:49:34,you.
00:49:34,00:49:35,Because they're so stupid.
00:49:35,00:49:39,"Apparently, they're so stupid according to a big research study that was done."
00:49:39,00:49:43,"I can tell you that emus do really like, they're like shiny objects a lot."
00:49:43,00:49:47,"So if you put a disco ball in a tree, emus will stare at it for hours on end."
00:49:47,00:49:48,Really?
00:49:48,00:49:49,Really?
00:49:49,00:49:51,"And then once, a bit of macarena?"
00:49:51,00:49:55,"Well, I think this has been, a similar thing has been used in hunting them."
00:49:55,00:50:01,"So again, traditional aboriginal hunters will lure emus by hanging a ball of emu feathers"
00:50:01,00:50:06,"and rags from a tree, which I guess must catch the light, or I mean, it certainly looks weird"
00:50:06,00:50:07,and it's an unusual object for them.
00:50:07,00:50:10,"And they just gather around it and they're captivated, at which point you can throw a"
00:50:10,00:50:12,spear at them and kill them.
00:50:12,00:50:14,"Is that not because they're all going, ""Hang on, we're flightless."
00:50:14,00:50:17,"How did that emu get up in the tree?"""
00:50:17,00:50:19,She's cracked it.
00:50:19,00:50:22,"Hey Barry, what was the trick?"
00:50:22,00:50:23,Come on.
00:50:23,00:50:24,That's so good.
00:50:24,00:50:25,They can't fly.
00:50:25,00:50:30,"They do when they run, they still sort of wave their tiny little wings that they have."
00:50:30,00:50:34,They think they're not fully sure why they do this from the article I read.
00:50:34,00:50:38,The suggestion is it's a balance thing to help them with the speed because they can go
00:50:38,00:50:40,"very, very fast."
00:50:40,00:50:44,"But I did read that when they have, because they have predators like dingoes and eagles"
00:50:44,00:50:45,and so on in Australia.
00:50:45,00:50:51,And one way that they fight against a dingo is they leap into the air and they just start
00:50:51,00:50:55,"stomping them, sort of like just jumping on their head and shoving them into the ground."
00:50:55,00:50:56,They've got claws.
00:50:56,00:50:57,Nice.
00:50:57,00:51:00,But it's just such a wonderful fighting style touch.
00:51:00,00:51:01,The tantrum.
00:51:01,00:51:02,It's a toddler tantrum.
00:51:02,00:51:08,"Just on emu penises, which are rare, but, no, sorry, they're not rare for emus."
00:51:08,00:51:09,Every emu.
00:51:09,00:51:10,Every emu.
00:51:10,00:51:14,Half of emus have an emu penis.
00:51:14,00:51:16,Nobody else has an emu penis.
00:51:16,00:51:21,But birds with penises are rare because 97% of bird species don't have them and emus
00:51:21,00:51:22,are in the rare.
00:51:22,00:51:27,"But they don't have blood in their penises or when they have an erection, it doesn't"
00:51:27,00:51:28,fill up with blood.
00:51:28,00:51:35,"It fills with lymphatic fluid, which is very unusual and it's also low pressure."
00:51:35,00:51:36,Yeah.
00:51:36,00:51:38,So they can't keep an erection for very long.
00:51:38,00:51:43,But one interesting thing about that is that the other birds that have penises also are
00:51:43,00:51:44,lymph-based.
00:51:44,00:51:45,Yeah.
00:51:45,00:51:51,And so that means that the earliest ancestor of these two lineages of penis birds must have
00:51:51,00:51:55,also had a limp lymph penis.
00:51:55,00:51:59,"And what that means is that it was some time, a long time ago, and what came before the"
00:51:59,00:52:01,"birds, the dinosaurs."
00:52:01,00:52:07,And so if we ever find out that a dinosaur had a penis and at the moment we haven't found
00:52:07,00:52:11,"it in the fossil record, but if we ever do, there's a good chance that it would also be"
00:52:11,00:52:12,a lymph-based.
00:52:12,00:52:13,"Ah, interesting."
00:52:13,00:52:14,Wow.
00:52:14,00:52:15,Yeah.
00:52:15,00:52:19,I saw a picture of an incredible penis the other day and it was sent to me by John Blasch's
00:52:19,00:52:20,"Snell, the explorer."
00:52:20,00:52:23,Was it his?
00:52:23,00:52:26,You really should probably block him.
00:52:26,00:52:30,"His only fan's account is really, really cool."
00:52:30,00:52:31,This is a great explorer.
00:52:31,00:52:36,He's a friend of the podcast and he showed me a picture of a bat that he'd caught out.
00:52:36,00:52:39,"I think it was in the Amazon somewhere, ginormous."
00:52:39,00:52:40,It looked like it was as tall as us basically.
00:52:40,00:52:42,Did he catch it by the penis?
00:52:42,00:52:46,"He might as well have, because this bat was hung unlike anything I've seen."
00:52:46,00:52:50,It was like a human penis on a bat.
00:52:50,00:52:51,It was insane.
00:52:51,00:52:52,I'll show you the photo later.
00:52:52,00:52:53,It's truly extraordinary.
00:52:53,00:52:54,"I'm all right, actually."
00:52:54,00:52:55,Are you?
00:52:55,00:52:56,"Okay, Andy."
00:52:56,00:52:57,I'll get it to you.
00:52:57,00:53:00,"I wonder, because they hang upside down a lot, I'm just trying to think of..."
00:53:00,00:53:02,It would just keep bashing them in the face.
00:53:02,00:53:08,I thought it was windy here.
00:53:08,00:53:11,Did you guys read the Emu story from earlier this year?
00:53:11,00:53:12,No.
00:53:12,00:53:13,"It was only a month ago, I think."
00:53:13,00:53:15,It was Malmesbury in Wiltshire.
00:53:15,00:53:16,Where I used to live.
00:53:16,00:53:17,Really?
00:53:17,00:53:18,"Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:53:18,00:53:19,Very exciting.
00:53:19,00:53:21,I wish I'd still lived there for this story.
00:53:21,00:53:26,"Well, there was a man who crashed his car into a shop front and he was with an accomplice."
00:53:26,00:53:30,"He ran away from the scene of the crash because he was incredibly drunk and incredibly high,"
00:53:30,00:53:31,I think.
00:53:31,00:53:36,"He was incredibly in charge of a car, crashed it into a building, legged it, and the chef"
00:53:36,00:53:39,"of the local hotel was a guy called Dean Wade, saw him do this, thought, ""I'm not letting"
00:53:39,00:53:40,someone get away with that.
00:53:40,00:53:41,"That's terrible."""
00:53:41,00:53:42,Chased after him.
00:53:42,00:53:43,They ran away.
00:53:43,00:53:46,"They ran for quite some distance and they ended up at the edge of the local wildlife enclosure,"
00:53:46,00:53:48,which has a field full of Emus.
00:53:48,00:53:50,"And Dean Wade shouted, ""Don't go in there."
00:53:50,00:53:51,"There are Emus."""
00:53:51,00:53:52,"And the guy said, ""I'm going in there."
00:53:52,00:53:53,"I'll take on the Emus."""
00:53:53,00:53:56,"And the Emus absolutely, they pecked him a new one."
00:53:56,00:53:58,They really went for him.
00:53:58,00:54:02,He shouldn't have lain on his back and flailed around in the air.
00:54:02,00:54:06,"He was trying to do kung fu kicks and karate chops on this Emus, and the Emus was absolutely"
00:54:06,00:54:10,"just dodging all of it and pecking and pecking and pecking him, and he was apprehended this"
00:54:10,00:54:11,man.
00:54:11,00:54:14,"I think we're crediting the Emus with the apprehension right, because the fact that"
00:54:14,00:54:17,"this guy, the chef, is still in full chef's guard."
00:54:17,00:54:21,"He knew that the Emus could take care of it, so he was then free to go get the police."
00:54:21,00:54:23,Was he sort of shepherding them towards the Emus?
00:54:23,00:54:26,"I'm not sure if it was a deliberate conscious thought, but I think when it happened he thought"
00:54:26,00:54:27,that's a stroke of luck.
00:54:27,00:54:29,I wonder if he was okay with this guy?
00:54:29,00:54:30,I think he's fine.
00:54:30,00:54:31,"Yeah, he's been alright."
00:54:31,00:54:32,He lived.
00:54:32,00:54:35,"I wonder if the chef was torn to get the police, or to then go and steal the eggs from the"
00:54:35,00:54:36,next.
00:54:36,00:54:37,"Yeah, you're right."
00:54:37,00:54:38,That would be great for the cocktail.
00:54:38,00:54:40,Have we ever done the Emu War?
00:54:40,00:54:41,"Yeah, we have."
00:54:41,00:54:42,Have we on the show?
00:54:42,00:54:45,"No, it was in International Factball, which I think isn't canon."
00:54:45,00:54:50,"Well, the interesting thing about it is when we mentioned it, did we mention that it's"
00:54:50,00:54:51,basically a myth?
00:54:51,00:54:52,Is it?
00:54:52,00:54:53,No way.
00:54:53,00:54:59,"So the idea is that Australia went to war against the Emus and lost, and far be it from"
00:54:59,00:55:05,"me to back up the Australians, but it turns out that basically it was one Western Australian"
00:55:05,00:55:10,"governor did declare war on the Emus, but didn't send all of his guys out there."
00:55:10,00:55:17,"He sent three people out to attack all these Emus, three men, a pickup truck and two machine"
00:55:17,00:55:21,"guns, and that was against 20,000 Emus."
00:55:21,00:55:25,"And basically what had happened was there had been the war, the Second World War, and"
00:55:25,00:55:30,"the Australian government had given land to a lot of veterans, but the land was really"
00:55:30,00:55:31,"dry, it was really barren."
00:55:31,00:55:36,"They couldn't really grow anything apart from wheat, and the Emus loved wheat, so the Emus"
00:55:36,00:55:40,"were going after the wheat, and the governor of Western Australia decided, well, we're"
00:55:40,00:55:42,"going to declare war on them, and we're going to shoot them."
00:55:42,00:55:44,"Well, because they've got all these veterans living there."
00:55:44,00:55:45,"Well, that's what they thought."
00:55:45,00:55:49,"They thought we'll send three of our actual army guys, and we'll get all of the veterans"
00:55:49,00:55:53,"to come in as well, but actually really, I mean, there was no chance that they were"
00:55:53,00:55:54,ever going to do anything.
00:55:54,00:55:59,"I think it was Major Meredith, who was the guy in charge of them, and he said, basically"
00:55:59,00:56:03,"the birds could keep running even after they'd been shot, and so there was very little chance"
00:56:03,00:56:04,of them winning this engagement.
00:56:04,00:56:08,"Well, the other thing is like, if you had a big mob of Emus, let's say there's a hundred"
00:56:08,00:56:14,"in a mob, as soon as you shot them, they split up into two fifties, and it was like the Gremlins"
00:56:14,00:56:15,when they get water on them.
00:56:15,00:56:20,"It's like being attacked by a worm, and you chop it up, and you just keep making it worse."
00:56:20,00:56:24,"And Meredith said after he said, if we had a military division with the bullet carrying"
00:56:24,00:56:30,"capacity of these birds, it would face any army in the world."
00:56:30,00:56:33,And really the reason that it became a big deal is because it was the time of the Great
00:56:33,00:56:38,"Depression, and the Great Emu War was kind of a funny story that they could have in the"
00:56:38,00:56:39,newspapers all the time.
00:56:39,00:56:40,"Yeah, right."
00:56:40,00:56:41,It is funny.
00:56:41,00:56:42,And it is funny.
00:56:42,00:56:43,It is.
00:56:43,00:56:44,That's amazing.
00:56:44,00:56:45,That's not quite true.
00:56:45,00:56:46,That's incredible.
00:56:46,00:56:49,"I feel like Aussies get so much crap for the Emu War, so now there you go, you can come"
00:56:49,00:56:50,back up people with.
00:56:50,00:56:52,We only sent three old blokes in there.
00:56:52,00:56:53,Exactly.
00:56:53,00:56:56,"And I have to say, on Twitter, this is probably the most requested story that people sent"
00:56:56,00:56:58,"to me saying, have you guys ever spoken about the Emu War?"
00:56:58,00:56:59,It's just constantly...
00:56:59,00:57:00,So there you go.
