00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,900
 Hi everyone, welcome to this week's episode of No Such Thing as a Fish before we start.

2
00:00:04,900 --> 00:00:10,880
 If you don't have plans in the next couple of weeks and you live in the Scottish area,

3
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:16,860
 then you must come and see our show. We will be in Inverness, Aberdeen, Edinburgh and Glasgow

4
00:00:16,860 --> 00:00:21,720
 between the 31st of August and the 4th of September and you will not regret it. It is

5
00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:27,360
 such a fun night with all sorts of facts and silliness and just messing around. There'll

6
00:00:27,360 --> 00:00:32,440
 be a prize for someone on the stage. I can't give you any more details about that. But

7
00:00:32,440 --> 00:00:37,360
 if you're in Scotland and you'd like to come and see the show, then go to nosuchthingsafish.com/live

8
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:44,040
 and the details are there. We also have a show coming up in Cardiff on the 13th of September,

9
00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:49,400
 which I think is very nearly sold out if it's not already sold out and we have a show in

10
00:00:49,400 --> 00:00:55,080
 London on the 9th of September. Now that is sold out, but you can see it virtually. So

11
00:00:55,080 --> 00:00:58,600
 there are virtual audience tickets available for that and if you would like to get those

12
00:00:58,600 --> 00:01:04,440
 or indeed the tickets for Cardiff, then again go to nosuchthingsafish.com/live. Thank you

13
00:01:04,440 --> 00:01:08,520
 very much to everyone who's joined Club Fish in the last few weeks. We're having a whole

14
00:01:08,520 --> 00:01:15,840
 great amount of fun behind that velvet rope with loads of bonus material and ad free episodes.

15
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:21,140

17
00:01:27,320 --> 00:01:32,360
 the main podcast will always always always be free and that free podcast is just about

18
00:01:32,360 --> 00:01:36,720
 to begin. Okay, so on with the podcast.

19
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:56,220
 Hello and welcome to another episode of No Such Thing as a Fish, a weekly podcast coming

20
00:01:56,220 --> 00:02:01,100
 to you from the QI offices in Covert Garden. My name is Dan Schreiber, I'm sitting here

21
00:02:01,100 --> 00:02:06,100
 with James Harkin, Anna Tyshinski and Andrew Hunter Murray and once again we have gathered

22
00:02:06,100 --> 00:02:10,720
 round the microphones with our four favourite facts from the last seven days and in no particular

23
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:16,200
 order here we go. Starting with fact number one and that is James.

24
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:23,780
 Okay, my fact this week is that in the 1930 World Cup semi-final between the USA and Argentina,

25
00:02:23,780 --> 00:02:29,160
 the American medic accidentally chlorophened himself and had to be carried off.

26
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:35,080
 It's very funny and it raises for me a lot of other questions like who was he trying

27
00:02:35,080 --> 00:02:42,940
 to chloroform? Was it like a classic movie where the bank robber or whoever is trying

28
00:02:42,940 --> 00:02:47,460
 to steal someone puts the rag over them? Was he like holding his face?

29
00:02:47,460 --> 00:02:52,540
 There is so much wrong with this fact I think and we might go into all of it but it's basically

30
00:02:52,540 --> 00:02:57,860
 it's on the FIFA website so I think it counts as a fact for us but I can't see it mentioned

31
00:02:57,860 --> 00:03:03,140
 in any contemporary part and chloroform doesn't really work like that.

32
00:03:03,140 --> 00:03:06,800
 Incredible self-drive-by on your own face.

33
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:10,600
 So he was called Jack Cole is that right?

34
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:13,960
 And there are a few versions of events on there so one is that he ran on the pitch trying

35
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:18,280
 to help another player and then a thing broke in his bag and he had chloroform in his bag

36
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:23,680
 and then that broke and then the fumes were raised and knocked him out.

37
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:27,920
 Another version is that he went on to the pitch to argue with the referee about something

38
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:33,380
 and threw a bottle of chloroform onto the ground in anger and then it came up and a

39
00:03:33,380 --> 00:03:34,380
 fume stopped him out.

40
00:03:34,380 --> 00:03:37,280
 That's a red card, that's a red card from the header.

41
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:42,280
 The earliest I've managed to trace a story back is to a journalist called Brian Glanville

42
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:45,940
 and a lot of people think he's the greatest football writer of all time he's really really

43
00:03:45,940 --> 00:03:52,020
 famous but he was born in 1931 so he couldn't have been at this match but it is on the FIFA

44
00:03:52,020 --> 00:03:56,140
 website but the other thing is if you look at contemporary reports from the newspapers

45
00:03:56,140 --> 00:04:00,440
 at the time it's not mentioned and I found an interview with Jack Cole which was done

46
00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:03,980
 about 15 years later and he doesn't mention it in that interview.

47
00:04:03,980 --> 00:04:08,940
 You might not though, to be fair, he couldn't remember.

48
00:04:08,940 --> 00:04:14,080
 It's amazing, the self-knockout is just phenomenal right, like it's one of those things where

49
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:17,880
 you don't know what to do when you see someone do it and Ash who wrote the theme tune for

50
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:22,900
 our song, he once was in a bar fight, it's very weird, exactly, you can't quite imagine

51
00:04:22,900 --> 00:04:23,900
 it.

52
00:04:23,900 --> 00:04:30,220
 He's so zen, so this was I guess just pre-zen, just pre-zen Ash and he went for the first

53
00:04:30,220 --> 00:04:33,820
 punch against these other people, he took the swing and as he took the swing he took

54
00:04:33,820 --> 00:04:39,000
 a step forward, slipped, fell on the ground, knocked himself out and that was end of fight.

55
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,340
 Is that his only ever fight?

56
00:04:40,340 --> 00:04:42,340
 Yeah, he KO'd himself on the first go.

57
00:04:42,340 --> 00:04:47,580
 So he actually has a 100% record of knocking someone out.

58
00:04:47,580 --> 00:04:50,300
 One win, one loss in his only match.

59
00:04:50,300 --> 00:04:54,260
 Another source I found this is a book called Angels with Dirty Faces by Jonathan Wilson

60
00:04:54,260 --> 00:04:59,140
 which is the best book that I've ever read on South American football and he mentions

61
00:04:59,140 --> 00:05:00,140
 it in that.

62
00:05:00,140 --> 00:05:04,580
 It's like such a big qualifier, like this is the best book I've ever read, is what they'll

63
00:05:04,580 --> 00:05:09,220
 use on the camera.

64
00:05:09,220 --> 00:05:14,180
 This generally, so we haven't really properly said, but 1930 World Cup was the very first

65
00:05:14,180 --> 00:05:19,100
 ever World Cup and it was set up because the Olympics weren't taking football seriously

66
00:05:19,100 --> 00:05:21,820
 and they weren't having it as recognized as an official sport.

67
00:05:21,820 --> 00:05:27,020
 So this was set up in South America, but as a result of that distance it meant that a

68
00:05:27,020 --> 00:05:31,140
 lot of countries around the world didn't come and play because the journey there and the

69
00:05:31,140 --> 00:05:35,220
 journey back as well as the subsequent tournament would mean they were out of play for like

70
00:05:35,220 --> 00:05:38,820
 three months which didn't work with their local tournaments and so on.

71
00:05:38,820 --> 00:05:41,900
 Also expensive for a lot of countries.

72
00:05:41,900 --> 00:05:46,780
 Also the home countries, so England, Northern Ireland, Scotland, Wales, they thought that

73
00:05:46,780 --> 00:05:51,860
 actually really they were more important than FIFA and so they had their own kind of home

74
00:05:51,860 --> 00:05:55,500
 nations tournament and they didn't really see this as a proper World Cup so they weren't

75
00:05:55,500 --> 00:05:56,500
 in it.

76
00:05:56,500 --> 00:06:02,780
 So I read that the American team who were playing in this semi-final was mostly made up of English

77
00:06:02,780 --> 00:06:04,780
 and Scottish professional footballers.

78
00:06:04,780 --> 00:06:05,780
 Mostly Scottish, yeah.

79
00:06:05,780 --> 00:06:09,860
 I did account, I made it to be five Scottish players and one English player.

80
00:06:09,860 --> 00:06:10,860
 It's a lot.

81
00:06:10,860 --> 00:06:11,860
 It is a lot.

82
00:06:11,860 --> 00:06:12,860
 It's more than you're normally allowed.

83
00:06:12,860 --> 00:06:13,860
 I don't know.

84
00:06:13,860 --> 00:06:14,860
 I think.

85
00:06:14,860 --> 00:06:18,300
 Well, and Col was Irish, I think, wasn't he?

86
00:06:18,300 --> 00:06:19,300
 Yeah.

87
00:06:19,300 --> 00:06:22,260
 In fact, he was Irish, brought up in Scotland and he'd just gone to America to track down

88
00:06:22,260 --> 00:06:26,260
 his father who'd run out on him and he found himself in America and they were like, "God,

89
00:06:26,260 --> 00:06:27,260
 are you from the British Isles?

90
00:06:27,260 --> 00:06:28,580
 Yeah, would you mind playing for us?"

91
00:06:28,580 --> 00:06:29,580
 Wow.

92
00:06:29,580 --> 00:06:32,260
 But it's weird because America were quite good then, so I don't know why they had to

93
00:06:32,260 --> 00:06:33,260
 poach.

94
00:06:33,260 --> 00:06:37,140
 This was like a heyday for American football and it sort of plummeted after this because

95
00:06:37,140 --> 00:06:41,780
 of the football wars or the soccer wars, I think, where it's so unexciting.

96
00:06:41,780 --> 00:06:43,900
 It's the most boring war ever.

97
00:06:43,900 --> 00:06:44,900
 Oh, okay.

98
00:06:44,900 --> 00:06:46,380
 It's like there were two bodies.

99
00:06:46,380 --> 00:06:48,220
 Everyone just clawed four of themselves.

100
00:06:48,220 --> 00:06:52,540
 No, there were two bodies trying to manage football who were competing with each other.

101
00:06:52,540 --> 00:06:57,940
 It was like the USFA and the ASL and they fought so much that everyone was like, "Well,

102
00:06:57,940 --> 00:06:58,940
 this is tedious.

103
00:06:58,940 --> 00:06:59,940
 You're all arguing so much."

104
00:06:59,940 --> 00:07:01,580
 And the depression came, which didn't help.

105
00:07:01,580 --> 00:07:06,220
 So, and the American team, they were known by the French as the shot potters because

106
00:07:06,220 --> 00:07:07,820
 they were so big.

107
00:07:07,820 --> 00:07:10,660
 They were like really big, strong players.

108
00:07:10,660 --> 00:07:12,060
 But they got battered in this game.

109
00:07:12,060 --> 00:07:16,500
 They lost 6-1 to Argentina and one of the reasons might have been because one of the

110
00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:19,540
 players got a broken leg in the first half.

111
00:07:19,540 --> 00:07:21,020
 I so don't believe this.

112
00:07:21,020 --> 00:07:24,140
 Look, I've seen people with broken legs and it's really painful.

113
00:07:24,140 --> 00:07:28,660
 It was guy called Ralph Tracy and apparently afterwards he was diagnosed with that, but

114
00:07:28,660 --> 00:07:31,260
 I reckon it was a tiny chipped bone, Max.

115
00:07:31,260 --> 00:07:32,260
 You're saying he played on?

116
00:07:32,260 --> 00:07:33,260
 Yeah.

117
00:07:33,260 --> 00:07:34,260
 He played on the whole game.

118
00:07:34,260 --> 00:07:35,260
 He got broken leg.

119
00:07:35,260 --> 00:07:36,260
 Yeah, really early on.

120
00:07:36,260 --> 00:07:40,500
 It was really weird because there was another player, Andy Old, who ripped his lip open.

121
00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:41,500
 Yeah.

122
00:07:41,500 --> 00:07:44,740
 And the problem was is that there were no sort of proper rules about how you could treat

123
00:07:44,740 --> 00:07:45,740
 the wound.

124
00:07:45,740 --> 00:07:50,140
 And so, he played the rest of a match with a rag in his mouth to sort of stem the bleeding.

125
00:07:50,140 --> 00:07:53,060
 Unfortunately, that rag had got chlorophyll on it.

126
00:07:53,060 --> 00:07:54,060
 Yeah.

127
00:07:54,060 --> 00:07:59,980
 And so, basically, they were a good team, but they basically got beaten from pillar to post.

128
00:07:59,980 --> 00:08:04,980
 And in the end, by the second half, they really were just hobbling around and the Argentinians

129
00:08:04,980 --> 00:08:05,980
 absolutely battered them.

130
00:08:05,980 --> 00:08:06,980
 Yeah.

131
00:08:06,980 --> 00:08:11,940
 I guess because it was 6-1 and America scored their goal in the last, in the 89th minute,

132
00:08:11,940 --> 00:08:12,940
 I think.

133
00:08:12,940 --> 00:08:13,940
 Did they?

134
00:08:13,940 --> 00:08:14,940
 Yeah.

135
00:08:14,940 --> 00:08:15,940
 Well, you think, kind of, what's the point?

136
00:08:15,940 --> 00:08:16,940
 Why are you still trying at that point?

137
00:08:16,940 --> 00:08:17,940
 No, that's great.

138
00:08:17,940 --> 00:08:18,940
 It's a bit of honor.

139
00:08:18,940 --> 00:08:19,940
 Yeah.

140
00:08:19,940 --> 00:08:22,140
 In the final, which was Argentina versus Uruguay, Uruguay won that final.

141
00:08:22,140 --> 00:08:25,420
 And in Argentina, they kicked off.

142
00:08:25,420 --> 00:08:28,140
 The Uruguayan embassy was attacked.

143
00:08:28,140 --> 00:08:33,620
 They did a morning parade through Buenos Aires and two people were reportedly shot for not

144
00:08:33,620 --> 00:08:35,820
 saluting as the parade went past.

145
00:08:35,820 --> 00:08:37,500
 Oh, my God.

146
00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:38,500
 Amazing.

147
00:08:38,500 --> 00:08:42,900
 The one newspaper said that since they'd lost Argentina, probably it meant that international

148
00:08:42,900 --> 00:08:47,300
 football tournaments were a bit useless, so they should just never do them ever again.

149
00:08:47,300 --> 00:08:51,100
 And eight players from that Argentinian team never played for the country ever again.

150
00:08:51,100 --> 00:08:52,100
 Wow.

151
00:08:52,100 --> 00:08:53,100
 Yeah.

152
00:08:53,100 --> 00:08:55,820
 This feels like it's about, you know, in a marriage where you have a massive fight about

153
00:08:55,820 --> 00:08:56,820
 where you keep the spoons?

154
00:08:56,820 --> 00:08:58,660
 It's not about, not about the spoons really.

155
00:08:58,660 --> 00:08:59,660
 I don't think it's about the spoons.

156
00:08:59,660 --> 00:09:02,740
 I think it actually always is about where you keep the spoons because it's a very clear

157
00:09:02,740 --> 00:09:03,740
 place where they should be.

158
00:09:03,740 --> 00:09:04,740
 Yeah.

159
00:09:04,740 --> 00:09:08,140
 And he's like to his wife, "You've had an affair just like this about the spoons, isn't it?

160
00:09:08,140 --> 00:09:10,140
 Yes, it's about the spoons."

161
00:09:10,140 --> 00:09:16,660
 Yeah, there was a ref called John Langanus, and he's pronounced Longanus.

162
00:09:16,660 --> 00:09:17,660
 Longanus.

163
00:09:17,660 --> 00:09:18,660
 Sorry.

164
00:09:18,660 --> 00:09:21,060
 I imagine that's what the fans sung to him.

165
00:09:21,060 --> 00:09:22,060
 Yeah.

166
00:09:22,060 --> 00:09:23,060
 John Longanus.

167
00:09:23,060 --> 00:09:24,060
 Longanus.

168
00:09:24,060 --> 00:09:25,980
 He was Belgian, right?

169
00:09:25,980 --> 00:09:26,980
 Yes.

170
00:09:26,980 --> 00:09:31,220
 And he was the head ref of the, I'd say he was the one who officiated the final.

171
00:09:31,220 --> 00:09:36,620
 And he was really worried about the tensions running really high, as James says, like even

172
00:09:36,620 --> 00:09:37,620
 post the match.

173
00:09:37,620 --> 00:09:42,500
 So one of the Argentinian players, Luis Monti, he got a death threat sent, and the referee

174
00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:45,500
 demanded a quick escape route to get back to his ship.

175
00:09:45,500 --> 00:09:49,820
 He wanted, not a secret tunnel, but as near as damn it, a safe passage back to his.

176
00:09:49,820 --> 00:09:50,820
 Exactly.

177
00:09:50,820 --> 00:09:51,820
 Because he thought whatever call he makes.

178
00:09:51,820 --> 00:09:54,700
 So Longanus asked for a safe passage to him.

179
00:09:54,700 --> 00:09:55,700
 Yeah.

180
00:09:55,700 --> 00:10:00,900
 So I mean, it did sound like it was a bit of an intense atmosphere, and there was a

181
00:10:00,900 --> 00:10:02,900
 controversial goal in that final as well.

182
00:10:02,900 --> 00:10:03,900
 So yeah.

183
00:10:03,900 --> 00:10:08,340
 Well, Luis Monti, for instance, he was like the hard man of the Argentinian defense, but

184
00:10:08,340 --> 00:10:12,620
 he did get this death threat, and afterwards there was a suggestion in the Argentinian

185
00:10:12,620 --> 00:10:17,940
 media that it was one of the Uruguayan players who drank him up with a silly voice and said

186
00:10:17,940 --> 00:10:19,740
 he was going to kill him.

187
00:10:19,740 --> 00:10:23,380
 But in the end, he still played, he didn't think he was going to play, but all the way

188
00:10:23,380 --> 00:10:27,140
 through, he would kind of try and ingratiate himself with the crowd.

189
00:10:27,140 --> 00:10:31,140
 So whenever a Uruguayan player went down, he would sort of go and help them up and stuff

190
00:10:31,140 --> 00:10:32,140
 like that.

191
00:10:32,140 --> 00:10:34,220
 What, in the hope of the guy who was going to kill him, holding the revolver somewhere

192
00:10:34,220 --> 00:10:36,540
 in the crowd, thought, oh, he is a nice guy actually.

193
00:10:36,540 --> 00:10:37,540
 After all, yeah.

194
00:10:37,540 --> 00:10:38,540
 Yeah.

195
00:10:38,540 --> 00:10:40,540
 I'll put it away.

196
00:10:40,540 --> 00:10:44,780
 One of the other things about the crowd that was there, so it was 90,000 plus, but that

197
00:10:44,780 --> 00:10:50,660
 was only five days into the tournament because their main stadium, the Estadio Centenario,

198
00:10:50,660 --> 00:10:53,940
 was not ready in time, and because of the weather as well, were raining.

199
00:10:53,940 --> 00:10:57,500
 So there were two other smaller stadiums where they ended up going through as well.

200
00:10:57,500 --> 00:10:59,580
 Yeah, it was the grass hadn't grown properly, right?

201
00:10:59,580 --> 00:11:03,900
 And so they thought that the studs would kind of dig it up, the cleats for American listeners

202
00:11:03,900 --> 00:11:06,100
 would kind of dig up the ground.

203
00:11:06,100 --> 00:11:07,100
 Was this because of the weather?

204
00:11:07,100 --> 00:11:11,100
 Because one thing I read was that it had rained for 92 consecutive days before the first game

205
00:11:11,100 --> 00:11:12,100
 of this world cup.

206
00:11:12,100 --> 00:11:13,100
 Oh, my God.

207
00:11:13,100 --> 00:11:14,100
 Wow.

208
00:11:14,100 --> 00:11:15,100
 92 days.

209
00:11:15,100 --> 00:11:16,100
 Imagine the state of their reservoirs.

210
00:11:16,100 --> 00:11:17,100
 Lovely.

211
00:11:17,100 --> 00:11:18,100
 Yeah, gorgeous.

212
00:11:18,100 --> 00:11:19,100
 Lovely.

213
00:11:19,100 --> 00:11:20,100
 Very green lawns.

214
00:11:20,100 --> 00:11:22,420
 I could do it in 92 days of rain right now.

215
00:11:22,420 --> 00:11:23,420
 It's like that.

216
00:11:23,420 --> 00:11:26,860
 Do you remember that summer when Rihanna's umbrella was in the charts and it rained for

217
00:11:26,860 --> 00:11:28,660
 like three months non-stop here as well?

218
00:11:28,660 --> 00:11:29,660
 Yeah, yeah.

219
00:11:29,660 --> 00:11:32,100
 So why the song did so well?

220
00:11:32,100 --> 00:11:33,700
 There was a suggestion of that, yeah.

221
00:11:33,700 --> 00:11:38,100
 I remember it was like they had real problems at Wimbledon because they couldn't play any

222
00:11:38,100 --> 00:11:40,300
 of the matches because it just rained non-stop.

223
00:11:40,300 --> 00:11:42,700
 And is there a suggestion that Rihanna did some Cloudseed in May?

224
00:11:42,700 --> 00:11:43,700
 Well, there is.

225
00:11:43,700 --> 00:11:44,700
 Wow.

226
00:11:44,700 --> 00:11:45,700
 I think the label did.

227
00:11:45,700 --> 00:11:46,700
 Yeah.

228
00:11:46,700 --> 00:11:47,700
 She probably didn't know about it.

229
00:11:47,700 --> 00:11:50,580
 She flew the Cessna herself, hoping that...

230
00:11:50,580 --> 00:11:51,580
 Chloroform.

231
00:11:51,580 --> 00:11:52,580
 Chloroform?

232
00:11:52,580 --> 00:11:53,580
 Yeah.

233
00:11:53,580 --> 00:11:54,580
 No, thank you.

234
00:11:54,580 --> 00:11:59,540
 I've got a sample here, and let's try it.

235
00:11:59,540 --> 00:12:02,900
 That's enough of your chat up line, Simon.

236
00:12:02,900 --> 00:12:09,060
 So, yeah, chloroform is really, really interesting stuff in that.

237
00:12:09,060 --> 00:12:11,260
 I just love the story of how it was first used.

238
00:12:11,260 --> 00:12:15,220
 It was first sort of properly introduced to surgery in the UK by a doctor called James

239
00:12:15,220 --> 00:12:16,220
 Simpson.

240
00:12:16,220 --> 00:12:20,820
 And before that, they were using ether, but the dose is very hard to get right, and it

241
00:12:20,820 --> 00:12:23,780
 smells horrible and all of this, so chloroform was an improvement.

242
00:12:23,780 --> 00:12:28,780
 And in 1847, Simpson had two other doctors who were called Keith and Duncan, their surnames,

243
00:12:28,780 --> 00:12:33,740
 I think, round to dinner, and he said, "Look, I've got this stuff, do you want to try it?"

244
00:12:33,740 --> 00:12:38,380
 And they tried it, got lightheaded, laughed a lot, and then all just fell unconscious.

245
00:12:38,380 --> 00:12:40,660
 And then someone came into the room, and they were just out.

246
00:12:40,660 --> 00:12:44,020
 I imagine one of them went, "Your surname's also a first name."

247
00:12:44,020 --> 00:12:45,020
 Yeah, exactly.

248
00:12:45,020 --> 00:12:50,500
 They actually had witnesses for the whole thing.

249
00:12:50,500 --> 00:12:54,940
 It sounds like they had really fun parties, these guys, and they'd spent an entire summer

250
00:12:54,940 --> 00:12:59,260
 trying to find a better replacement for ether, so they'd spent an entire summer inhaling

251
00:12:59,260 --> 00:13:03,740
 various concoctions of gases around their dining room tables, sort of collapsing and

252
00:13:03,740 --> 00:13:05,420
 having fits and stuff.

253
00:13:05,420 --> 00:13:08,300
 And then they remembered that, "I've got this thing called chloroform that a friend told

254
00:13:08,300 --> 00:13:09,300
 me about.

255
00:13:09,300 --> 00:13:10,740
 I think it's under some waste paper."

256
00:13:10,740 --> 00:13:11,740
 Picked it out.

257
00:13:11,740 --> 00:13:17,180
 They tried it, and apparently unwanted hilarity seized the party for a while, and their conversation

258
00:13:17,180 --> 00:13:20,940
 was of unusual intelligence for a few minutes.

259
00:13:20,940 --> 00:13:24,660
 The first woman who took it was actually at the party that night, because there were family

260
00:13:24,660 --> 00:13:28,060
 and friends there who were finding them also charming and entertaining.

261
00:13:28,060 --> 00:13:31,860
 And so once they'd sampled it a few times, the guests had to say, "Well, can we ever

262
00:13:31,860 --> 00:13:32,860
 go?"

263
00:13:32,860 --> 00:13:37,980
 And she apparently gallantly took her turn and then fell asleep while crying, "I'm an

264
00:13:37,980 --> 00:13:38,980
 angel.

265
00:13:38,980 --> 00:13:39,980
 I'm an angel."

266
00:13:39,980 --> 00:13:40,980
 Oh, okay.

267
00:13:40,980 --> 00:13:44,260
 Actually, I think she wasn't the first woman to take chloroform.

268
00:13:44,260 --> 00:13:45,260
 No, sorry.

269
00:13:45,260 --> 00:13:46,260
 Maybe it wasn't.

270
00:13:46,260 --> 00:13:49,500
 So it had been discovered, it was discovered about three times by three different people

271
00:13:49,500 --> 00:13:51,540
 in the same month or so.

272
00:13:51,540 --> 00:13:54,700
 And I should say, a lot of my facts have come from a book called "Cloroform" by Linda

273
00:13:54,700 --> 00:13:56,780
 Stratman, which is great and rollicking.

274
00:13:56,780 --> 00:13:57,780
 Absolutely.

275
00:13:57,780 --> 00:13:58,780
 Knockout.

276
00:13:58,780 --> 00:13:59,940
 Again, on the cover.

277
00:13:59,940 --> 00:14:02,460
 It's for the cover.

278
00:14:02,460 --> 00:14:07,020
 So Samuel Guthrie was a doctor in Massachusetts, and he thought what he had was this thing called

279
00:14:07,020 --> 00:14:12,780
 Dutch liquid, which there was an existing recipe for, which involved chlorine and, you

280
00:14:12,780 --> 00:14:14,180
 know, chlorate ether.

281
00:14:14,180 --> 00:14:18,460
 So he had made it, but he kind of accidentally distilled it one extra time, or there was

282
00:14:18,460 --> 00:14:20,740
 an extra ingredient in the mix when he made it.

283
00:14:20,740 --> 00:14:22,780
 So he had chloroform without knowing it.

284
00:14:22,780 --> 00:14:27,020
 But because he thought it was a known substance, which was already being used for medicine,

285
00:14:27,020 --> 00:14:31,100
 he just kept some in his lab and would distribute bottles to friends and family.

286
00:14:31,100 --> 00:14:36,300
 And his daughter, who was eight-year-old Cynthia, would often run into the lab, dip her fingers

287
00:14:36,300 --> 00:14:40,460
 in the liquid, taste it, and that was just a little treat for her.

288
00:14:40,460 --> 00:14:44,380
 On one occasion, she took too much of it, and she fell over completely asleep.

289
00:14:44,380 --> 00:14:45,380
 Oh, my God.

290
00:14:45,380 --> 00:14:48,060
 And so she was probably the first person to be knocked out by chloroform.

291
00:14:48,060 --> 00:14:49,060
 Wow.

292
00:14:49,060 --> 00:14:50,060
 What a claim.

293
00:14:50,060 --> 00:14:51,060
 Yeah.

294
00:14:51,060 --> 00:14:54,540
 And Stratman writes, "It is probable that he simply assumed she was drunk."

295
00:14:54,540 --> 00:14:56,100
 It's all right, everyone.

296
00:14:56,100 --> 00:14:59,100
 It's all right by eight-year-old's drunk.

297
00:14:59,100 --> 00:15:01,020
 She's not to self out with chloroform.

298
00:15:01,020 --> 00:15:02,020
 Don't worry.

299
00:15:02,020 --> 00:15:03,700
 And what do we use it for today?

300
00:15:03,700 --> 00:15:05,580
 Is it used still to put patients under?

301
00:15:05,580 --> 00:15:06,580
 No.

302
00:15:06,580 --> 00:15:07,580
 We use it for manufacturing.

303
00:15:07,580 --> 00:15:10,020
 I think it's used to make Teflon and some other stuff.

304
00:15:10,020 --> 00:15:12,100
 It's a sort of primer ingredient for Teflon, yeah.

305
00:15:12,100 --> 00:15:13,100
 Right.

306
00:15:13,100 --> 00:15:14,100
 Yeah.

307
00:15:14,100 --> 00:15:15,100
 But no, it sort of fell out of use.

308
00:15:15,100 --> 00:15:18,140
 It started falling out of use in the 19th century because people started to question

309
00:15:18,140 --> 00:15:19,140
 it.

310
00:15:19,140 --> 00:15:20,140
 It kills people.

311
00:15:20,140 --> 00:15:21,140
 Yeah, sometimes.

312
00:15:21,140 --> 00:15:22,140
 Also, I think it gets a bad press.

313
00:15:22,140 --> 00:15:23,140
 Like, it kills.

314
00:15:23,140 --> 00:15:27,260
 They did a massive study and found that it killed one in 2,500 of the patients that it

315
00:15:27,260 --> 00:15:31,820
 had been used on in the 19th century, which is not great, but it's not terrible for 19th

316
00:15:31,820 --> 00:15:32,820
 century medicine.

317
00:15:32,820 --> 00:15:33,820
 No, for 19th century.

318
00:15:33,820 --> 00:15:37,100
 And then there was another study which found it could like four in a thousand.

319
00:15:37,100 --> 00:15:40,180
 But I think the four in a thousand one was done in the Civil War when everyone was quite

320
00:15:40,180 --> 00:15:41,180
 injured anyway.

321
00:15:41,180 --> 00:15:42,180
 Right.

322
00:15:42,180 --> 00:15:43,180
 So you're not at your best.

323
00:15:43,180 --> 00:15:44,180
 Yeah.

324
00:15:44,180 --> 00:15:47,900
 What a journey it's had, you know, in terms of its repurposed uses.

325
00:15:47,900 --> 00:15:49,220
 Like if it was on, who do you think you are?

326
00:15:49,220 --> 00:15:53,660
 And you were like, your ancestor used to like kidnap people, you know, and then you're...

327
00:15:53,660 --> 00:15:55,300
 Is that something to be proud of?

328
00:15:55,300 --> 00:15:57,900
 Well, in movies, that's the classic thing.

329
00:15:57,900 --> 00:15:59,340
 It gets used to fumigate grain.

330
00:15:59,340 --> 00:16:00,340
 That's a fun...

331
00:16:00,340 --> 00:16:01,340
 Does it?

332
00:16:01,340 --> 00:16:02,340
 Yeah, yeah.

333
00:16:02,340 --> 00:16:03,340
 It's a fun use of it.

334
00:16:03,340 --> 00:16:04,340
 It's been great.

335
00:16:04,340 --> 00:16:06,860
 It's from the great glory days of kidnapping and curing people in the Civil War.

336
00:16:06,860 --> 00:16:11,500
 You know, like a farmer, now you're in like the cooking industry with Teflon.

337
00:16:11,500 --> 00:16:15,980
 We don't know that anyone was really kind of kidnapped using it, right?

338
00:16:15,980 --> 00:16:17,620
 Because it's really hard to use.

339
00:16:17,620 --> 00:16:18,620
 Yeah.

340
00:16:18,620 --> 00:16:23,260
 We might have said this before, but basically you'd need the exact correct dosage.

341
00:16:23,260 --> 00:16:26,180
 Otherwise they would just feel a bit woozy or they would die.

342
00:16:26,180 --> 00:16:29,940
 You'd have to get the exact thing in between and also it would take around five minutes.

343
00:16:29,940 --> 00:16:30,940
 It takes minutes.

344
00:16:30,940 --> 00:16:31,940
 Did it even happen in movies?

345
00:16:31,940 --> 00:16:32,940
 Or is that one of those missing memories?

346
00:16:32,940 --> 00:16:33,940
 Yeah, it does.

347
00:16:33,940 --> 00:16:34,940
 It happens in a Sherlock Holmes story.

348
00:16:34,940 --> 00:16:36,740
 It happens in Dickens, I think.

349
00:16:36,740 --> 00:16:38,500
 Or Wilkie Collins, I think, maybe?

350
00:16:38,500 --> 00:16:42,460
 That's weird, because Dickens' wife used chloroform to give birth.

351
00:16:42,460 --> 00:16:45,460
 So Dickens was well into chloroform, right?

352
00:16:45,460 --> 00:16:49,220
 And it's in one of his books, and I can't remember which one it is, unfortunately.

353
00:16:49,220 --> 00:16:53,860
 But it was in one of his books, but he doesn't call it chloroform because whenever the book

354
00:16:53,860 --> 00:16:57,220
 was sent set, it was before chloroform had been invented.

355
00:16:57,220 --> 00:17:01,180
 So he talks about this kind of special thing which knocks someone out really quickly, but

356
00:17:01,180 --> 00:17:04,860
 he doesn't specifically say it's chloroform because he was so into chloroform we're pretty

357
00:17:04,860 --> 00:17:05,860
 sure that's what he meant.

358
00:17:05,860 --> 00:17:06,860
 That's great.

359
00:17:06,860 --> 00:17:10,420
 Like you say, it is quite hard to administer, and it does have this really dark Goldilocks

360
00:17:10,420 --> 00:17:13,300
 phase where it works, and then on either side it's a bit useless.

361
00:17:13,300 --> 00:17:17,420
 But even so, there was this massive spate of crimes reported in the '40s as soon as it

362
00:17:17,420 --> 00:17:18,420
 became popular.

363
00:17:18,420 --> 00:17:19,420
 1840s.

364
00:17:19,420 --> 00:17:20,420
 In the 1840s.

365
00:17:20,420 --> 00:17:21,420
 Yeah, the '40s.

366
00:17:21,420 --> 00:17:22,420
 Sorry.

367
00:17:22,420 --> 00:17:23,420
 Sorry.

368
00:17:23,420 --> 00:17:24,420
 Yeah, yeah.

369
00:17:24,420 --> 00:17:25,420
 I think you were seeing.

370
00:17:25,420 --> 00:17:27,900
 When I say the '90s, I'm usually referring to the 1790s.

371
00:17:27,900 --> 00:17:28,900
 Yeah.

372
00:17:28,900 --> 00:17:29,900
 Yeah.

373
00:17:29,900 --> 00:17:30,900
 Yeah.

374
00:17:30,900 --> 00:17:31,900
 It was his club night.

375
00:17:31,900 --> 00:17:32,900
 How's it going then?

376
00:17:32,900 --> 00:17:33,900
 There's a lot of baroque music.

377
00:17:33,900 --> 00:17:34,900
 A lot of ether.

378
00:17:34,900 --> 00:17:35,900
 A lot of fun, actually.

379
00:17:35,900 --> 00:17:40,780
 But yeah, there were things, there were all these stories about, you know, a handkerchief

380
00:17:40,780 --> 00:17:44,420
 would be waved in the face of someone and they would collapse, or a lot of stories of women

381
00:17:44,420 --> 00:17:47,300
 coming up behind men and putting a handkerchief to their face and then.

382
00:17:47,300 --> 00:17:48,300
 Women chloroforming men.

383
00:17:48,300 --> 00:17:49,300
 Yes.

384
00:17:49,300 --> 00:17:50,300
 Blow for equality.

385
00:17:50,300 --> 00:17:51,300
 I know.

386
00:17:51,300 --> 00:17:52,500
 Score, right?

387
00:17:52,500 --> 00:17:57,100
 But there was one doctor, actually, who got so annoyed by all these stories by, I think,

388
00:17:57,100 --> 00:17:58,100
 the 1850s or '60s.

389
00:17:58,100 --> 00:18:02,020
 Because he said, this doesn't make any sense, it takes minutes and minutes for it to work,

390
00:18:02,020 --> 00:18:06,220
 that he eventually soaked a handkerchief in chloroform and waved it in front of his aunt's

391
00:18:06,220 --> 00:18:10,740
 face until he was absolutely exhausted of shaking to prove that it couldn't do anything.

392
00:18:10,740 --> 00:18:11,740
 Oh, that's great.

393
00:18:11,740 --> 00:18:13,620
 Has he proven that to his aunt?

394
00:18:13,620 --> 00:18:16,540
 Maybe, though, I don't know the argument that came before that.

395
00:18:16,540 --> 00:18:17,540
 Yeah.

396
00:18:17,540 --> 00:18:18,540
 Some misgivings.

397
00:18:18,540 --> 00:18:19,540
 Yeah.

398
00:18:19,540 --> 00:18:29,020
 OK, it is time for fact number two and that is Anna.

399
00:18:29,020 --> 00:18:34,380
 My fact is that there's a group of astronomers called Solar Wind Sherpas who drag their equipment

400
00:18:34,380 --> 00:18:37,260
 around the world to watch every single solar eclipse.

401
00:18:37,260 --> 00:18:38,260
 Wow.

402
00:18:38,260 --> 00:18:41,980
 I think these guys are so cool.

403
00:18:41,980 --> 00:18:46,780
 They've been going since 1995, so they visited every single eclipse since then, eclipses

404
00:18:46,780 --> 00:18:49,900
 happened, total eclipses were talking, but I want to re-18 months.

405
00:18:49,900 --> 00:18:56,180
 It was set up by this woman called Shadia Refai Habal, who's a scientist, and yeah,

406
00:18:56,180 --> 00:18:59,740
 they take all their equipment and they go and watch eclipses, and they want to see the

407
00:18:59,740 --> 00:19:04,140
 corona, which is the bit when you see a totality in an eclipse, you've got that little bit

408
00:19:04,140 --> 00:19:10,420
 of ring of light around it, and that's basically the stuff that the sun is emitting, and it's

409
00:19:10,420 --> 00:19:14,580
 always too bright, the sun, the rest of the sunlight is too bright for us usually to see

410
00:19:14,580 --> 00:19:15,580
 it.

411
00:19:15,580 --> 00:19:17,780
 It's not bad for them to google corona these days.

412
00:19:17,780 --> 00:19:23,660
 It was a struggle with the beer, but I think the last few years has made it a lot worse.

413
00:19:23,660 --> 00:19:26,120
 And so how long they've been doing this, how long they've been trekking?

414
00:19:26,120 --> 00:19:27,120
 Since '95.

415
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:28,120
 Since '95.

416
00:19:28,120 --> 00:19:29,120
 Yeah.

417
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:30,120
 That's 1795.

418
00:19:30,120 --> 00:19:31,120
 Yeah.

419
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:32,120
 Wow.

420
00:19:32,120 --> 00:19:34,260
 They're called umbra files as well, aren't they?

421
00:19:34,260 --> 00:19:35,260
 There's shadow.

422
00:19:35,260 --> 00:19:37,900
 They've got called coronafiles, eclipsaholics.

423
00:19:37,900 --> 00:19:42,900
 Yeah, you don't want the coronafiles nickname catching on, you really want to shed that.

424
00:19:42,900 --> 00:19:47,620
 I got these from the website BeingInTheShadow.com, which is an eclipse chaser.

425
00:19:47,620 --> 00:19:48,620
 So set that up.

426
00:19:48,620 --> 00:19:49,620
 Who's seen 12 now?

427
00:19:49,620 --> 00:19:50,620
 Cool.

428
00:19:50,620 --> 00:19:51,620
 You've seen 12.

429
00:19:51,620 --> 00:19:52,620
 That's so cool.

430
00:19:52,620 --> 00:19:53,620
 It's a lot.

431
00:19:53,620 --> 00:19:54,620
 People get really into it.

432
00:19:54,620 --> 00:19:55,620
 Yeah.

433
00:19:55,620 --> 00:19:56,620
 You know, they see their first one.

434
00:19:56,620 --> 00:19:57,620
 You think if you've seen one eclipse, you've seen them all?

435
00:19:57,620 --> 00:19:58,620
 I know.

436
00:19:58,620 --> 00:20:03,700
 I know the eclipsah files are going to come up now, going to throw some shade.

437
00:20:03,700 --> 00:20:07,440
 But yeah, I would have thought they were all the same.

438
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:10,580
 You'd think so, but I guess it's such a unique event even for our soldiers.

439
00:20:10,580 --> 00:20:12,700
 Well, obviously not if they've seen 20 others.

440
00:20:12,700 --> 00:20:17,860
 No, I guess I mean like your first cocaine high, once you've done that, you know, some

441
00:20:17,860 --> 00:20:20,900
 people do, I guess, they do get addicted.

442
00:20:20,900 --> 00:20:21,900
 They really get addicted.

443
00:20:21,900 --> 00:20:25,380
 They do say it's a kind of transformative experience and they just, wow, they need it

444
00:20:25,380 --> 00:20:26,380
 again.

445
00:20:26,380 --> 00:20:27,380
 Yeah.

446
00:20:27,380 --> 00:20:30,100
 Well, Matt Parker, a buddy of ours, who's friend of the podcast, Steve Mould, who was

447
00:20:30,100 --> 00:20:31,100
 on last week.

448
00:20:31,100 --> 00:20:32,180
 They were in a group together.

449
00:20:32,180 --> 00:20:37,180
 He goes chasing eclipses, sometimes on cruises with his wife because Lucy, his wife is an

450
00:20:37,180 --> 00:20:39,100
 actual solar physicist.

451
00:20:39,100 --> 00:20:42,900
 She looks at coronal mass ejection for her, for her livelihood.

452
00:20:42,900 --> 00:20:46,620
 And actually, just speaking of them as a couple, there's a thing that gets done with

453
00:20:46,620 --> 00:20:47,820
 eclipses now.

454
00:20:47,820 --> 00:20:49,900
 So it's called Bailey's beads, right?

455
00:20:49,900 --> 00:20:54,300
 And that is an actual phenomena of, like a corona, but they're just really beads rather

456
00:20:54,300 --> 00:20:55,300
 than a full circle.

457
00:20:55,300 --> 00:20:56,300
 Exactly.

458
00:20:56,300 --> 00:20:57,300
 So it looks like diamonds.

459
00:20:57,300 --> 00:20:58,300
 When the moon is over the sun.

460
00:20:58,300 --> 00:20:59,580
 When the moon is over the sun.

461
00:20:59,580 --> 00:21:03,700
 And it's to do with the fact that I believe because the moon obviously has bumps and lumps

462
00:21:03,700 --> 00:21:04,700
 all over it.

463
00:21:04,700 --> 00:21:08,140
 It's sort of like when the final bit of the eclipse is covered, a little bit will come

464
00:21:08,140 --> 00:21:09,740
 through a bit that's a bit lower.

465
00:21:09,740 --> 00:21:14,060
 And so they look like little diamonds and people propose to their, you won't be able

466
00:21:14,060 --> 00:21:15,540
 to see you being proposed to.

467
00:21:15,540 --> 00:21:16,540
 Oh yeah.

468
00:21:16,540 --> 00:21:17,540
 Good point.

469
00:21:17,540 --> 00:21:18,540
 It's a totality of an eclipse.

470
00:21:18,540 --> 00:21:19,540
 It's a totality of an eclipse.

471
00:21:19,540 --> 00:21:20,540
 I'm just not so distracting.

472
00:21:20,540 --> 00:21:21,540
 I definitely say no, regardless.

473
00:21:21,540 --> 00:21:24,540
 You've only got six minutes to watch it.

474
00:21:24,540 --> 00:21:25,780
 Well, wait a minute.

475
00:21:25,780 --> 00:21:28,900
 You can see people in the dark when there's a new moon or something.

476
00:21:28,900 --> 00:21:29,900
 You can still see people.

477
00:21:29,900 --> 00:21:32,860
 But I thought the whole point of a totality in eclipse was that you can't see anything.

478
00:21:32,860 --> 00:21:34,020
 You can't see a cost.

479
00:21:34,020 --> 00:21:35,020
 You can.

480
00:21:35,020 --> 00:21:36,020
 It doesn't go pitch black, Andy.

481
00:21:36,020 --> 00:21:37,020
 Do you still remember the eclipse?

482
00:21:37,020 --> 00:21:38,020
 There's still stars, for instance.

483
00:21:38,020 --> 00:21:39,020
 When there's a solar eclipse.

484
00:21:39,020 --> 00:21:40,020
 Yeah.

485
00:21:40,020 --> 00:21:42,140
 It just goes quite dark, like a light night.

486
00:21:42,140 --> 00:21:43,140
 Do you?

487
00:21:43,140 --> 00:21:44,140
 1999.

488
00:21:44,140 --> 00:21:45,140
 We were all alive.

489
00:21:45,140 --> 00:21:46,140
 Oh yeah.

490
00:21:46,140 --> 00:21:47,140
 But I wasn't in Cornwall wherever it was.

491
00:21:47,140 --> 00:21:49,340
 I actually was in Cornwall and it wasn't that dark.

492
00:21:49,340 --> 00:21:51,940
 It was quite dark, but you could make out someone proposing to you.

493
00:21:51,940 --> 00:21:52,940
 If someone said, "When are you marrying me?"

494
00:21:52,940 --> 00:21:53,940
 I wouldn't be groping around.

495
00:21:53,940 --> 00:21:54,940
 Who says that?

496
00:21:54,940 --> 00:21:55,940
 There are so many possibilities.

497
00:21:55,940 --> 00:21:56,940
 Wow.

498
00:21:56,940 --> 00:21:57,940
 Oh, okay.

499
00:21:57,940 --> 00:21:58,940
 I thought it wasn't really dark.

500
00:21:58,940 --> 00:22:03,460
 Well, when there's no moon at night time, you can still make things out.

501
00:22:03,460 --> 00:22:04,940
 You can still make out like shadows.

502
00:22:04,940 --> 00:22:06,940
 I've got my phone torch on.

503
00:22:06,940 --> 00:22:11,380
 Was that the thing when the, because the last, was it the last time a full eclipse was in

504
00:22:11,380 --> 00:22:12,380
 the UK?

505
00:22:12,380 --> 00:22:13,380
 It was 1999.

506
00:22:13,380 --> 00:22:14,380
 Yeah.

507
00:22:14,380 --> 00:22:15,380
 Anywhere in the UK.

508
00:22:15,380 --> 00:22:16,380
 I remember seeing footage of it, wasn't it?

509
00:22:16,380 --> 00:22:18,380
 Lots of people were taking photos with flashes on their cameras at the time.

510
00:22:18,380 --> 00:22:21,860
 It was just incredibly annoying, because, you know, obviously you're trying to see the

511
00:22:21,860 --> 00:22:22,860
 wonder of the eclipse.

512
00:22:22,860 --> 00:22:23,860
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

513
00:22:23,860 --> 00:22:27,220
 Yeah, you would have been the pain in the ass with a massive torch, right?

514
00:22:27,220 --> 00:22:29,780
 I've lost my diamond ring.

515
00:22:29,780 --> 00:22:35,580
 There was a big solar eclipse in North America in 2017, but at that time they had a load

516
00:22:35,580 --> 00:22:39,740
 of monitoring stations and they were checking the bees in North America.

517
00:22:39,740 --> 00:22:47,380
 And at the moment of complete pitch black, all of the bees went silent, apart from one

518
00:22:47,380 --> 00:22:48,380
 bee.

519
00:22:48,380 --> 00:22:49,380
 What?

520
00:22:49,380 --> 00:22:51,860
 It was one bee who buzzed.

521
00:22:51,860 --> 00:22:52,860
 No.

522
00:22:52,860 --> 00:22:53,860
 And they don't know why.

523
00:22:53,860 --> 00:22:54,860
 They can't work out.

524
00:22:54,860 --> 00:22:55,860
 This is a Disney film.

525
00:22:55,860 --> 00:22:56,860
 I'm not fucking Eric.

526
00:22:56,860 --> 00:22:57,860
 Really?

527
00:22:57,860 --> 00:22:58,860
 It was not so funny.

528
00:22:58,860 --> 00:22:59,860
 That's amazing.

529
00:22:59,860 --> 00:23:00,860
 Just one bee didn't get the memo.

530
00:23:00,860 --> 00:23:01,860
 Yeah.

531
00:23:01,860 --> 00:23:07,060
 One day, Galen at the University of Missouri says that maybe he was slow getting back to

532
00:23:07,060 --> 00:23:13,780
 the hive, or he was a bee with particularly good eyesight, who was affected by the eclipse.

533
00:23:13,780 --> 00:23:14,780
 That's so funny.

534
00:23:14,780 --> 00:23:19,020
 There was a story about a squirrel going nuts as well during the eclipse, and I go really,

535
00:23:19,020 --> 00:23:20,020
 really spitty.

536
00:23:20,020 --> 00:23:22,780
 Sorry, I missed my own thing.

537
00:23:22,780 --> 00:23:26,460
 And afterwards they were like, do squirrels go crazy in the eclipse?

538
00:23:26,460 --> 00:23:30,140
 Or was it just the fact that we only saw one squirrel, and we're basing all the knowledge

539
00:23:30,140 --> 00:23:31,700
 now on that.

540
00:23:31,700 --> 00:23:38,180
 So, on this point, there has been a study from 2020 titled Total Eclipse of the Zoo, which

541
00:23:38,180 --> 00:23:41,220
 is all about how all the different animals in the zoo react.

542
00:23:41,220 --> 00:23:43,060
 Why does that work as a pun?

543
00:23:43,060 --> 00:23:44,540
 It doesn't rhyme with heart.

544
00:23:44,540 --> 00:23:45,540
 It's not a pun.

545
00:23:45,540 --> 00:23:46,540
 It's a reference to eclipses.

546
00:23:46,540 --> 00:23:49,060
 But it's a reference to the song.

547
00:23:49,060 --> 00:23:51,260
 Yeah, it's a reference to the song, Total Eclipse.

548
00:23:51,260 --> 00:23:52,260
 Then it's a bad reference.

549
00:23:52,260 --> 00:23:54,140
 If you're going to make a reference, make it a good reference.

550
00:23:54,140 --> 00:23:59,260
 Total eclipse of the heart, but you take out the E, and then you just study deer.

551
00:23:59,260 --> 00:24:00,260
 That's good.

552
00:24:00,260 --> 00:24:01,260
 That's really good.

553
00:24:01,260 --> 00:24:02,260
 That is good.

554
00:24:02,260 --> 00:24:04,260
 Well, they wanted, I think, a slightly broader remit for their study.

555
00:24:04,260 --> 00:24:08,260
 Total eclipse of the heart, or the deer, and other animals.

556
00:24:08,260 --> 00:24:11,060
 All sorts of animals, actually.

557
00:24:11,060 --> 00:24:15,140
 Warthogs anecdotally show no reaction to Total Eclipses.

558
00:24:15,140 --> 00:24:17,260
 Komodo dragons move around a bit more than usual.

559
00:24:17,260 --> 00:24:18,260
 OK.

560
00:24:18,260 --> 00:24:19,260
 Giraffes huddle together.

561
00:24:19,260 --> 00:24:20,260
 Oh.

562
00:24:20,260 --> 00:24:21,260
 Yeah.

563
00:24:21,260 --> 00:24:22,260
 That's so good.

564
00:24:22,260 --> 00:24:23,260
 Spiders dismantle their webs.

565
00:24:23,260 --> 00:24:24,260
 Yeah, where is that?

566
00:24:24,260 --> 00:24:27,620
 Well, like one specific species of spider rights.

567
00:24:27,620 --> 00:24:29,180
 Yeah, the orb waivers.

568
00:24:29,180 --> 00:24:30,180
 It takes it down.

569
00:24:30,180 --> 00:24:32,180
 Total eclipse of taking your web apart.

570
00:24:32,180 --> 00:24:33,180
 There we go.

571
00:24:33,180 --> 00:24:34,180
 It's closer.

572
00:24:34,180 --> 00:24:35,180
 It's lovely.

573
00:24:35,180 --> 00:24:36,180
 There you go.

574
00:24:36,180 --> 00:24:37,180
 Yeah.

575
00:24:37,180 --> 00:24:38,180
 Much closer.

576
00:24:38,180 --> 00:24:39,180
 Oh, dear.

577
00:24:39,180 --> 00:24:43,700
 There was a, from in August 2017, the, I think this is the eclipse that you were talking

578
00:24:43,700 --> 00:24:44,700
 about.

579
00:24:44,700 --> 00:24:48,700
 There was a story went round, which it turns out wasn't true, but it got picked up by everyone.

580
00:24:48,700 --> 00:24:50,400
 We think it's, we think it's not true.

581
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:55,700
 It's not confirmed entirely where a bunch of people were hospitalized because their eyeballs

582
00:24:55,700 --> 00:24:59,980
 were really hurting because they weren't able to get their hands on the proper glasses that

583
00:24:59,980 --> 00:25:02,380
 you would wear to use to look at the eclipse.

584
00:25:02,380 --> 00:25:06,700
 So instead they thought they'd put suntan lotion on their eyeballs and that would help.

585
00:25:06,700 --> 00:25:07,700
 No, that's not true.

586
00:25:07,700 --> 00:25:08,700
 That's the story.

587
00:25:08,700 --> 00:25:12,420
 And it was reported by Forbes and Snopes tried to get to the bottom of it and they called

588
00:25:12,420 --> 00:25:13,420
 up all the places.

589
00:25:13,420 --> 00:25:18,420
 They never heard back from the one lady who was quoted, who was called Trish Patterson,

590
00:25:18,420 --> 00:25:20,860
 who gave a quote saying that this had happened.

591
00:25:20,860 --> 00:25:21,860
 So it's inconclusive.

592
00:25:21,860 --> 00:25:22,860
 Because people have sunglasses.

593
00:25:22,860 --> 00:25:23,860
 I mean, that's the thing.

594
00:25:23,860 --> 00:25:27,660
 Most people didn't have sunglasses at the point, but I mean, normal sunglasses, not

595
00:25:27,660 --> 00:25:29,460
 special sunglasses, because I know you can't get special.

596
00:25:29,460 --> 00:25:31,220
 Are they lined with a particular crevium?

597
00:25:31,220 --> 00:25:32,220
 Yeah, they are.

598
00:25:32,220 --> 00:25:34,700
 But that's Andy says, you would have thought before you go to the suntan lotion on the

599
00:25:34,700 --> 00:25:37,460
 eyeball, you would go prepare sunglasses, like an ordinary pair of sunglasses.

600
00:25:37,460 --> 00:25:40,300
 Yeah, but you might just be out in the beach that day or whatever.

601
00:25:40,300 --> 00:25:41,300
 You've got your suntan lotion.

602
00:25:41,300 --> 00:25:42,620
 You haven't got access to glasses.

603
00:25:42,620 --> 00:25:46,180
 You've forgotten as a solar eclipse, I think you're going to someone said you could use

604
00:25:46,180 --> 00:25:48,580
 a Ritz cracker because there's little holes in the Ritz cracker.

605
00:25:48,580 --> 00:25:51,820
 So if you hold two Ritz crackers to your eyes, I don't think that works either.

606
00:25:51,820 --> 00:25:52,820
 Does it?

607
00:25:52,820 --> 00:25:53,820
 No, it's ultraviolet.

608
00:25:53,820 --> 00:25:56,780
 Because it will still let the sunlight onto your retina to burn it.

609
00:25:56,780 --> 00:26:00,780
 I think you might be able to hold a Ritz cracker and then put a sheet of paper behind it.

610
00:26:00,780 --> 00:26:02,340
 And I reckon you'd see the...

611
00:26:02,340 --> 00:26:05,940
 Because then the image of the sun appears on the paper, but don't put the cracker over

612
00:26:05,940 --> 00:26:06,940
 your eyes.

613
00:26:06,940 --> 00:26:09,700
 Well, look lots to test out when the next solar eclipse happens.

614
00:26:09,700 --> 00:26:12,220
 I never thought of using a Ritz cracker for stuff like that, though.

615
00:26:12,220 --> 00:26:15,420
 You could spy on people with a Ritz cracker or like, you know, when they have newspapers

616
00:26:15,420 --> 00:26:16,820
 on a bench in a park, a spy.

617
00:26:16,820 --> 00:26:18,340
 So I'm just holding up a Ritz cracker.

618
00:26:18,340 --> 00:26:22,780
 I think the idea is that you think someone's reading the newspaper, which is a completely

619
00:26:22,780 --> 00:26:27,580
 normal thing that someone might do, whereas putting two Ritz crackers over your eyes is

620
00:26:27,580 --> 00:26:30,740
 going to automatically arouse suspicion.

621
00:26:30,740 --> 00:26:33,340
 You'd have to spend years normalizing that activity.

622
00:26:33,340 --> 00:26:36,140
 And there could be a really fun viral ad campaign Ritz crackers did.

623
00:26:36,140 --> 00:26:37,140
 Like the Ice Bucket Challenge.

624
00:26:37,140 --> 00:26:38,140
 Yeah, yeah.

625
00:26:38,140 --> 00:26:39,660
 You've got wits putting Ritz crackers over your eyes.

626
00:26:39,660 --> 00:26:40,660
 Yes.

627
00:26:40,660 --> 00:26:41,660
 Everyone does it.

628
00:26:41,660 --> 00:26:42,660
 Get Ritzy.

629
00:26:42,660 --> 00:26:43,660
 Yeah.

630
00:26:43,660 --> 00:26:46,420
 And then it's all part of the long game for that bench moment.

631
00:26:46,420 --> 00:26:51,580
 If anyone from Ritz crackers is listening or am I six or please do get in touch.

632
00:26:51,580 --> 00:26:56,220
 It's unlikely brand partnership in history.

633
00:26:56,220 --> 00:27:03,100
 So another famous eclipse chaser is Cecilia Payne Gaposchkin in 1919, when she was 19

634
00:27:03,100 --> 00:27:07,260
 years old, she went on a solar eclipse expedition to Africa.

635
00:27:07,260 --> 00:27:10,660
 She later became the first woman to chair a Harvard department.

636
00:27:10,660 --> 00:27:15,980
 So she's a very famous academic and she is a person who proved what stars are made of

637
00:27:15,980 --> 00:27:18,420
 by spectroscopy of the light emitted.

638
00:27:18,420 --> 00:27:23,540
 So she worked out that it's made of helium and hydrogen, mostly all the stars, the sun

639
00:27:23,540 --> 00:27:24,540
 and all stars.

640
00:27:24,540 --> 00:27:29,260
 But we only found that out when she was in the early 20th century.

641
00:27:29,260 --> 00:27:30,260
 Oh, early 20th century.

642
00:27:30,260 --> 00:27:31,260
 Yeah.

643
00:27:31,260 --> 00:27:32,980
 So before that, they thought it must be made of metal.

644
00:27:32,980 --> 00:27:38,540
 Some kind of maybe some meteorites are flying into the sun and that metal kind of burns

645
00:27:38,540 --> 00:27:39,540
 and burns and burns.

646
00:27:39,540 --> 00:27:40,540
 That's what they thought.

647
00:27:40,540 --> 00:27:44,940
 Anyway, she worked out that it was made of mostly hydrogen and she wrote this paper about

648
00:27:44,940 --> 00:27:49,020
 it, but everyone thought it was obviously bullshit.

649
00:27:49,020 --> 00:27:53,980
 How on earth could that possibly be true that the stars are made of hydrogen and helium?

650
00:27:53,980 --> 00:27:59,740
 And so when she wrote her thesis at the very end, she wrote, this result is almost certainly

651
00:27:59,740 --> 00:28:00,740
 not real.

652
00:28:00,740 --> 00:28:01,740
 What?

653
00:28:01,740 --> 00:28:02,740
 Oh, no.

654
00:28:02,740 --> 00:28:04,580
 Because she wants to protect her career.

655
00:28:04,580 --> 00:28:07,340
 She thought that if she did this, yeah, she didn't back herself.

656
00:28:07,340 --> 00:28:10,820
 And it would be another 10, 20 years before people realized that that was true.

657
00:28:10,820 --> 00:28:11,820
 That's terrible.

658
00:28:11,820 --> 00:28:14,180
 Well, all you're hedging your bets and cheating, guys.

659
00:28:14,180 --> 00:28:18,500
 You can't say, oh, here's what I definitely think, except I may be just joking.

660
00:28:18,500 --> 00:28:21,300
 Have you guys heard of Donald Liebenberg?

661
00:28:21,300 --> 00:28:22,800
 Donald Liebenberg.

662
00:28:22,800 --> 00:28:23,800
 No.

663
00:28:23,800 --> 00:28:28,860
 From Clemson University in South Carolina, a very well-established umbra file, eclipse

664
00:28:28,860 --> 00:28:29,860
 a holic.

665
00:28:29,860 --> 00:28:30,860
 Okay.

666
00:28:30,860 --> 00:28:31,860
 Call him what you will.

667
00:28:31,860 --> 00:28:32,860
 Nerd.

668
00:28:32,860 --> 00:28:36,660
 So he's not seen more eclipses than anyone else.

669
00:28:36,660 --> 00:28:40,620
 There is a group of people who, as of 2017, had seen 33 each and they were the front runners,

670
00:28:40,620 --> 00:28:41,620
 which is a lot.

671
00:28:41,620 --> 00:28:46,260
 Oh, do you reckon there's going to be like a murder mystery where they all knock each

672
00:28:46,260 --> 00:28:51,020
 other off so that one person has the most or there's another eclipse, but it's a difficult

673
00:28:51,020 --> 00:28:56,100
 place and they all stop each other from getting there and like it's a mad, mad, mad, mad world.

674
00:28:56,100 --> 00:28:57,100
 Oh, yeah.

675
00:28:57,100 --> 00:28:58,100
 Yeah.

676
00:28:58,100 --> 00:28:59,100
 This is great.

677
00:28:59,100 --> 00:29:00,100
 Yeah.

678
00:29:00,100 --> 00:29:01,600
 Anyway, Liebenberg, he's, okay, riddle me this.

679
00:29:01,600 --> 00:29:03,420
 He's not seen the most eclipses in the world.

680
00:29:03,420 --> 00:29:09,940
 He's only seen 26, but he's spent more time in the totality of eclipse than anyone else.

681
00:29:09,940 --> 00:29:12,460
 Even though other people have seen several more than him, yes.

682
00:29:12,460 --> 00:29:13,460
 How can it be?

683
00:29:13,460 --> 00:29:15,220
 Is he a pilot?

684
00:29:15,220 --> 00:29:18,340
 No, but you're so close to the right.

685
00:29:18,340 --> 00:29:19,340
 Was he on a plane?

686
00:29:19,340 --> 00:29:20,340
 Hostess.

687
00:29:20,340 --> 00:29:21,340
 He's an ass.

688
00:29:21,340 --> 00:29:22,340
 Yes, yes.

689
00:29:22,340 --> 00:29:26,500
 No, for the 1973 eclipse, which is on June 30th of that year, there was a group of eclipse

690
00:29:26,500 --> 00:29:32,340
 experts who got on Concord and they followed the path of it and they experienced 74 minutes

691
00:29:32,340 --> 00:29:34,900
 of total eclipse at a thousand miles an hour.

692
00:29:34,900 --> 00:29:35,900
 Crazy.

693
00:29:35,900 --> 00:29:36,900
 How cool is that?

694
00:29:36,900 --> 00:29:37,900
 It is cool.

695
00:29:37,900 --> 00:29:38,900
 You've got too much money.

696
00:29:38,900 --> 00:29:41,700
 How did they see where they were going, Andy?

697
00:29:41,700 --> 00:29:42,700
 Surely.

698
00:29:42,700 --> 00:29:46,940
 Obviously, the plane had a torch on its front and planes have headlights, you know.

699
00:29:46,940 --> 00:29:53,140
 But to me, right, the whole point of an eclipse is it's over in like six minutes, right?

700
00:29:53,140 --> 00:29:54,140
 Yeah.

701
00:29:54,140 --> 00:29:58,980
 It's like it's bright and then the six minutes of weirdness and then it's bright again.

702
00:29:58,980 --> 00:30:02,220
 If you're going for 74 minutes, you might as well just fly at night time.

703
00:30:02,220 --> 00:30:03,220
 Exactly.

704
00:30:03,220 --> 00:30:05,500
 But I think things might stay weird and get really weird.

705
00:30:05,500 --> 00:30:06,500
 79.

706
00:30:06,500 --> 00:30:13,060
 So you're going to replenish the suntan on your eyeballs.

707
00:30:13,060 --> 00:30:18,380
 I was wondering about the glasses for people who can get hold of them, the special ones.

708
00:30:18,380 --> 00:30:25,660
 And I found out that there's a company called American Paper Optics who are the main producers

709
00:30:25,660 --> 00:30:29,700
 of them in America and their revenue doubles in years of solar eclipses.

710
00:30:29,700 --> 00:30:30,700
 Wait a minute.

711
00:30:30,700 --> 00:30:31,700
 A lot of people buy it.

712
00:30:31,700 --> 00:30:33,340
 Do you think it would more than double?

713
00:30:33,340 --> 00:30:34,340
 You would.

714
00:30:34,340 --> 00:30:38,220
 You think it would be an enormous spike in those years and quite leaving the other years.

715
00:30:38,220 --> 00:30:43,860
 They make other types of glasses as well, right?

716
00:30:43,860 --> 00:30:45,020
 They make 3D glasses.

717
00:30:45,020 --> 00:30:50,340
 So most of their customers, you know, when you get a 3D cinema or you sell them in cereal

718
00:30:50,340 --> 00:30:55,140
 packets or they're mostly freebies that they hand out so they get branding deals with companies.

719
00:30:55,140 --> 00:30:59,620
 But in like in 2017, for instance, their revenue went from seven million to 14 million dollars.

720
00:30:59,620 --> 00:31:00,620
 That's doubling.

721
00:31:00,620 --> 00:31:01,620
 And that's doubling.

722
00:31:01,620 --> 00:31:03,120
 That's what doubling is.

723
00:31:03,120 --> 00:31:06,620
 And they've prepared for two and a half years for the 2017 eclipses.

724
00:31:06,620 --> 00:31:09,580
 They doubled their stuff and the guy who runs...

725
00:31:09,580 --> 00:31:12,300
 Well, they could afford to, couldn't they, with all that double revenue they were counting

726
00:31:12,300 --> 00:31:13,300
 on?

727
00:31:13,300 --> 00:31:14,300
 It works out perfectly.

728
00:31:14,300 --> 00:31:15,300
 That's good projection.

729
00:31:15,300 --> 00:31:20,620
 And the guy who runs the company is a guy called John Gerrit who seems to be really obsessed

730
00:31:20,620 --> 00:31:21,620
 with eclipses.

731
00:31:21,620 --> 00:31:26,500
 He actually got his big glasses break in the cardboard glasses world in 1991 when this

732
00:31:26,500 --> 00:31:28,620
 astronomer got in touch and said, "There's going to be an eclipse.

733
00:31:28,620 --> 00:31:29,620
 Can you make some glasses for me?"

734
00:31:29,620 --> 00:31:33,060
 I hear that you make cardboard glasses.

735
00:31:33,060 --> 00:31:34,520
 And it ended up being a massive deal.

736
00:31:34,520 --> 00:31:41,560
 And he sold a million glasses to Corona Beer in 1991 when the eclipse was in Mexico.

737
00:31:41,560 --> 00:31:46,080
 And I think it must be that Corona, because of the Corona and the Corona, perfect partnership.

738
00:31:46,080 --> 00:31:47,080
 Genius.

739
00:31:47,080 --> 00:31:48,080
 Brilliant.

740
00:31:48,080 --> 00:31:49,080
 That's very good.

741
00:31:49,080 --> 00:31:50,080
 Yeah.

742
00:31:50,080 --> 00:31:54,480
 There was, you know, we spoke about solar eclipses not on a podcast, but on a book.

743
00:31:54,480 --> 00:31:56,560
 2017, our book of the year.

744
00:31:56,560 --> 00:32:01,480
 We had literally our scripted conversation in there and there's a great fact in there,

745
00:32:01,480 --> 00:32:07,700
 which is that NASA has two accounts, which is NASA Moon and at NASA Sun.

746
00:32:07,700 --> 00:32:13,220
 And on the day of the eclipse, NASA Moon blocked NASA Sun on Twitter.

747
00:32:13,220 --> 00:32:14,220
 Yeah.

748
00:32:14,220 --> 00:32:15,220
 Brilliant.

749
00:32:15,220 --> 00:32:16,220
 Okay.

750
00:32:16,220 --> 00:32:22,260
 It is time for fact number three.

751
00:32:22,260 --> 00:32:23,340
 And that is my fact.

752
00:32:23,340 --> 00:32:27,740
 My fact this week is that in 1906, there was a music streaming service which involved

753
00:32:27,740 --> 00:32:33,520
 just two people playing keyboards down the telephone.

754
00:32:33,520 --> 00:32:38,040
 So would I ring up and I'd immediately get piano music played at me?

755
00:32:38,040 --> 00:32:39,040
 You would.

756
00:32:39,040 --> 00:32:40,040
 Yeah.

757
00:32:40,040 --> 00:32:41,040
 So this was someone waiting for a call, basically.

758
00:32:41,040 --> 00:32:45,240
 And whenever the phone rang, they'd have to answer it and start playing piano at me.

759
00:32:45,240 --> 00:32:46,240
 No.

760
00:32:46,240 --> 00:32:50,000
 This is phenomenal when you think about the sort of the scale of what this person had

761
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:51,000
 built.

762
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:56,640
 So this was a lawyer called Thaddeus Cahill and he's 1867 to 1934.

763
00:32:56,640 --> 00:33:02,640
 And at the end of the 1800s, he decides he wants to invent a machine whereby if you called

764
00:33:02,640 --> 00:33:07,180
 up this one phone number, you would get music just streaming to you.

765
00:33:07,180 --> 00:33:08,540
 And it was a subscription model.

766
00:33:08,540 --> 00:33:11,760
 So he was going to sell it to hotels and restaurants and so on.

767
00:33:11,760 --> 00:33:15,460
 What you would do is you would hold a paper funnel to the phone receiver.

768
00:33:15,460 --> 00:33:19,940
 So that would act as your amplifier to the room that you were playing it out to.

769
00:33:19,940 --> 00:33:24,260
 And I think in answer to your question that they would be just playing Bach or whatever

770
00:33:24,260 --> 00:33:27,600
 and whenever you phone them up, you would get whatever they're playing at the time.

771
00:33:27,600 --> 00:33:29,760
 So if they're playing chopsticks, you get chopsticks.

772
00:33:29,760 --> 00:33:34,480
 So he basically invented the concept of music, sort of background music that can just be

773
00:33:34,480 --> 00:33:35,480
 playing.

774
00:33:35,480 --> 00:33:41,720
 But he, to do this, he invented a machine which was called the Telharmonium, which was

775
00:33:41,720 --> 00:33:47,000
 as big as the office space that we're in right now, a ginormous room in Manhattan.

776
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:51,800
 Can I just say, Dan, sorry to interrupt, but people at home don't know what the QI office

777
00:33:51,800 --> 00:33:52,800
 is like.

778
00:33:52,800 --> 00:33:56,360
 I think at the moment they're imagining like an aircraft hanger or something.

779
00:33:56,360 --> 00:33:57,940
 We now have clips on YouTube.

780
00:33:57,940 --> 00:33:58,940
 You can watch it.

781
00:33:58,940 --> 00:33:59,940
 You're so right.

782
00:33:59,940 --> 00:34:00,940
 It weighed 200 tons.

783
00:34:00,940 --> 00:34:01,940
 It weighed 200 tons.

784
00:34:01,940 --> 00:34:04,220
 And it was 60 feet long.

785
00:34:04,220 --> 00:34:07,180
 So it's actually significantly longer than the bit of the office that you can currently

786
00:34:07,180 --> 00:34:09,260
 see now if you are watching on YouTube.

787
00:34:09,260 --> 00:34:10,260
 Yes.

788
00:34:10,260 --> 00:34:11,260
 Yeah.

789
00:34:11,260 --> 00:34:13,780
 A picture, more feet the other way from the video.

790
00:34:13,780 --> 00:34:19,300
 They had all these phone lines that would be hanging in front of basically a ginormous

791
00:34:19,300 --> 00:34:23,220
 gramophone horn, which was the music as what was being pumped through.

792
00:34:23,220 --> 00:34:27,120
 I mean, it's very complicated to get your head around what this machine was, but effectively

793
00:34:27,120 --> 00:34:29,860
 what Cahill had invented was the first synthesizer.

794
00:34:29,860 --> 00:34:31,260
 It was electronic music.

795
00:34:31,260 --> 00:34:35,520
 I love the way of explaining how complicated all the wires were and stuff.

796
00:34:35,520 --> 00:34:41,000
 The Republican and Herald newspaper in Pennsylvania in 1907 started off explaining how it works

797
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:45,800
 and then said, "It would be useless to describe the more complex principles of the Telharmonium

798
00:34:45,800 --> 00:34:48,800
 because it would require diagrams and mathematics."

799
00:34:48,800 --> 00:34:49,800
 I'm with him.

800
00:34:49,800 --> 00:34:51,800
 It really tells I want to dance relatively.

801
00:34:51,800 --> 00:34:52,800
 Yeah.

802
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:55,800
 What's the surname of that?

803
00:34:55,800 --> 00:34:56,800
 Yeah.

804
00:34:56,800 --> 00:35:01,020
 So this was in Manhattan, as I say, it was located on Broadway in 39th Street.

805
00:35:01,020 --> 00:35:03,380
 It took up an entire floor of the building.

806
00:35:03,380 --> 00:35:05,380
 He called it the Telharmonic Hall.

807
00:35:05,380 --> 00:35:07,560
 He also called it the Music Plant.

808
00:35:07,560 --> 00:35:12,560
 And he advertised it as the music of AD 2000, which is really cool, really sci-fi.

809
00:35:12,560 --> 00:35:16,160
 He knew he was onto something that was kind of looking into the future.

810
00:35:16,160 --> 00:35:18,320
 Now, there's no radio at this point.

811
00:35:18,320 --> 00:35:24,720
 This guy is decades ahead of any other kind of broadcasting of just playing music out.

812
00:35:24,720 --> 00:35:29,500
 And there was a rumor that this was all generated, this music, by two people who would supposedly

813
00:35:29,500 --> 00:35:30,880
 play for 24 hours.

814
00:35:30,880 --> 00:35:34,600
 That was said in passing in an article, so there's no confirmation on that.

815
00:35:34,600 --> 00:35:35,600
 It might appear.

816
00:35:35,600 --> 00:35:37,920
 Yeah, but the music was being played by people.

817
00:35:37,920 --> 00:35:42,760
 And supposedly, this is where I get confused, could emulate sounds like the flute, or-

818
00:35:42,760 --> 00:35:43,760
 Well, it was electronic.

819
00:35:43,760 --> 00:35:45,080
 That was why it was so amazing.

820
00:35:45,080 --> 00:35:46,080
 Yeah, but how?

821
00:35:46,080 --> 00:35:47,080
 Did they record the-

822
00:35:47,080 --> 00:35:48,080
 No, no.

823
00:35:48,080 --> 00:35:49,080
 You add...

824
00:35:49,080 --> 00:35:50,080
 So I thought this was really interesting, because I've never known how, like, when you

825
00:35:50,080 --> 00:35:53,000
 get an electric keyboard and you press a button that plays a symbol or whatever, how

826
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:54,000
 do they do it?

827
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:57,400
 And it's basically just you add lots of harmonics to one tone.

828
00:35:57,400 --> 00:36:01,000
 So another amazing thing about this is it wasn't a normal musical instrument, it was

829
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:02,400
 an electronic instrument.

830
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:06,480
 So I think if you stood next to it, I'm not quite sure how the gramophone horn bit works.

831
00:36:06,480 --> 00:36:09,320
 If you stood next to it, you couldn't hear it play, I don't think.

832
00:36:09,320 --> 00:36:13,720
 You could only hear it play when the electrical signals were transmitted through cables, and

833
00:36:13,720 --> 00:36:16,360
 they were interpreted into sound at the other side.

834
00:36:16,360 --> 00:36:20,600
 And the electrical signals through this very complex system, you could overlay lots of

835
00:36:20,600 --> 00:36:23,080
 different notes on top of each other, so you'd have, like, the main note.

836
00:36:23,080 --> 00:36:26,600
 But then they worked out that the reason a trumpet sounds different to, like, a violin

837
00:36:26,600 --> 00:36:31,120
 is because there are kind of, like, harmonic sounds overlaying that main note.

838
00:36:31,120 --> 00:36:32,120
 That's insane.

839
00:36:32,120 --> 00:36:33,120
 It is unbelievable.

840
00:36:33,120 --> 00:36:34,360
 I'd love to know how realistic it was.

841
00:36:34,360 --> 00:36:35,360
 Wow.

842
00:36:35,360 --> 00:36:39,640
 I mean, it is that on top of what Anna's saying, there's quite a lot more, but it would be

843
00:36:39,640 --> 00:36:42,720
 kind of difficult to explain without mathematics in the program.

844
00:36:42,720 --> 00:36:46,360
 So we probably won't go into all that stuff now.

845
00:36:46,360 --> 00:36:48,000
 And we don't have any recordings.

846
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:49,000
 This is the other thing.

847
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:50,000
 And it doesn't exist.

848
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:51,000
 And it doesn't exist anymore.

849
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:52,000
 And it doesn't exist anymore.

850
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:53,000
 It was all for scrap.

851
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:54,000
 It's incredibly tragic.

852
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:55,600
 And there were complaints as well.

853
00:36:55,600 --> 00:36:59,040
 So it interrupted other transmissions at various points.

854
00:36:59,040 --> 00:37:00,040
 Yes.

855
00:37:00,040 --> 00:37:01,040
 So many complaints.

856
00:37:01,040 --> 00:37:03,480
 The US Navy complained that they had secret wireless transmissions, which they'd like

857
00:37:03,480 --> 00:37:08,120
 to hear, but they were getting Rossini overtures instead, thanks to the telemonium.

858
00:37:08,120 --> 00:37:10,600
 It interrupted phone calls a lot.

859
00:37:10,600 --> 00:37:14,360
 I mean, that was one of the reasons that it didn't succeed in the end, was that there

860
00:37:14,360 --> 00:37:16,040
 were just so many problems with it.

861
00:37:16,040 --> 00:37:18,160
 People would be on the phone and music would bleed in.

862
00:37:18,160 --> 00:37:21,800
 And in fact, I read one newspaper article from the time saying it had almost broken

863
00:37:21,800 --> 00:37:26,560
 up a marriage because a husband had called his wife to say he was working late in the

864
00:37:26,560 --> 00:37:27,560
 office.

865
00:37:27,560 --> 00:37:30,600
 But she heard the William Tell overture playing in the background.

866
00:37:30,600 --> 00:37:34,640
 So of course said, bullshit you in the office, may you round at a concert.

867
00:37:34,640 --> 00:37:38,520
 Having sex to the William Tell overture.

868
00:37:38,520 --> 00:37:46,520
 The US Navy one, I think, by the way, later on, I think in 1911, he worked with a guy

869
00:37:46,520 --> 00:37:51,000
 called De Forest and they came up with a new system that was basically the teleharmonium.

870
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:55,200
 But instead of going through telephone lines, they would use radio technology.

871
00:37:55,200 --> 00:37:59,540
 And it was when the US Navy was using radio technology as well, they would get that kind

872
00:37:59,540 --> 00:38:00,540
 of thing.

873
00:38:00,540 --> 00:38:03,000
 And there was a later bit of his grill where he was working on something else, where he

874
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:04,000
 was still.

875
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:09,000
 And it must have been good because it did get good reviews.

876
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:11,200
 So we don't have any samples of it anymore.

877
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:15,040
 But Mark Twain basically said he would postpone his death just to hear it again.

878
00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:16,040
 Wow.

879
00:38:16,040 --> 00:38:17,040
 Yeah.

880
00:38:17,040 --> 00:38:18,840
 How comfortable was he that he could do that?

881
00:38:18,840 --> 00:38:19,840
 Exactly.

882
00:38:19,840 --> 00:38:22,720
 He just sounds like you're in a situation where someone's about to kill you and you're

883
00:38:22,720 --> 00:38:23,960
 like, no, no, just one second.

884
00:38:23,960 --> 00:38:27,720
 I just want to listen to the William Tell overture one more time.

885
00:38:27,720 --> 00:38:30,480
 A last, yeah, like a last meal, a last song.

886
00:38:30,480 --> 00:38:34,540
 So he was quoted, he went to a recital basically, he was invited to go to one.

887
00:38:34,540 --> 00:38:39,020
 And he said, every time I see or hear a new wonder like this, I have to postpone my death

888
00:38:39,020 --> 00:38:40,020
 right off.

889
00:38:40,020 --> 00:38:44,140
 I couldn't possibly leave the world until I've heard this again and again.

890
00:38:44,140 --> 00:38:50,500
 And so in 1907, at this point, the plan of Cahill was that he wanted to put it into places

891
00:38:50,500 --> 00:38:54,460
 like, as I said, hotels and restaurants, but he couldn't get it into people's homes.

892
00:38:54,460 --> 00:38:58,020
 And Twain managed to work out that he could get it into his home because of his celebrity

893
00:38:58,020 --> 00:38:59,740
 status and so on.

894
00:38:59,740 --> 00:39:04,040
 And so the Times reported that he was going to glory in the fact that he would be able

895
00:39:04,040 --> 00:39:08,280
 to rejoice over other dead people when he died in having been the first man to have

896
00:39:08,280 --> 00:39:12,400
 tellharmonium music tuned in his house like gas.

897
00:39:12,400 --> 00:39:15,040
 Twain, Twain seemed really, really, really like it.

898
00:39:15,040 --> 00:39:18,640
 He said he wanted street lights to be connected to it, which would play the funeral march

899
00:39:18,640 --> 00:39:21,240
 during his funeral as his funeral procession.

900
00:39:21,240 --> 00:39:24,400
 He seems quite obsessed with death, doesn't he Mark Taylor at the moment?

901
00:39:24,400 --> 00:39:25,400
 Yeah, yeah.

902
00:39:25,400 --> 00:39:26,400
 He was getting elbow at this point, wasn't he?

903
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:27,400
 Yeah.

904
00:39:27,400 --> 00:39:30,460
 He was annoying, making him in the afterlife immediately going, "Yeah, in your face, I

905
00:39:30,460 --> 00:39:31,460
 heard the tellharmonium!"

906
00:39:31,460 --> 00:39:37,260
 Well, you do know that got dismantled after two years, don't you, and no one ever heard

907
00:39:37,260 --> 00:39:38,260
 of it ever again.

908
00:39:38,260 --> 00:39:39,260
 What?

909
00:39:39,260 --> 00:39:45,220
 So there was an earlier thing called the Teatrophone in 1881, and that played, it was in Paris,

910
00:39:45,220 --> 00:39:50,300
 and it was the theatre phone, and it transmitted music, but also some theatrical productions

911
00:39:50,300 --> 00:39:51,300
 over the phone.

912
00:39:51,300 --> 00:39:52,300
 Cool.

913
00:39:52,300 --> 00:39:53,300
 No, hang on a second.

914
00:39:53,300 --> 00:39:54,300
 Did phones exist in 1881?

915
00:39:54,300 --> 00:39:55,300
 Yeah, yeah.

916
00:39:55,300 --> 00:39:56,300
 There were quite a few.

917
00:39:56,300 --> 00:39:57,300
 There was only one.

918
00:39:57,300 --> 00:39:58,300
 Yeah.

919
00:39:58,300 --> 00:40:00,280
 Now there were some in 1880.

920
00:40:00,280 --> 00:40:01,280
 Oh, okay.

921
00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:02,280
 Yeah, yeah.

922
00:40:02,280 --> 00:40:03,280
 When was it in the 1870?

923
00:40:03,280 --> 00:40:04,280
 Was that when Bell patented?

924
00:40:04,280 --> 00:40:05,280
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

925
00:40:05,280 --> 00:40:06,280
 It was early, wasn't it?

926
00:40:06,280 --> 00:40:07,280
 Yeah.

927
00:40:07,280 --> 00:40:09,280
 Well, because people thought with the phone, weirdly, they thought the phone was going to

928
00:40:09,280 --> 00:40:12,300
 be used for mass entertainment, and they sampled this loads of time.

929
00:40:12,300 --> 00:40:15,080
 So yeah, there was the 1881 thing.

930
00:40:15,080 --> 00:40:19,240
 There was, I think the longest-running, most successful version of mass entertainment via

931
00:40:19,240 --> 00:40:25,520
 phone was the telephone newspaper, and this was in Hungary, and it was invented in 1893,

932
00:40:25,520 --> 00:40:31,620
 and it ran until 1944, and it was a subscriber service, and you just called it whenever,

933
00:40:31,620 --> 00:40:35,840
 and it started off just being a news service, so you called it, and they tell you the news.

934
00:40:35,840 --> 00:40:41,740
 But then it was music performances, there were fun, new pop songs, whatever you played.

935
00:40:41,740 --> 00:40:42,740
 When was this?

936
00:40:42,740 --> 00:40:43,740
 It was probably shows, 1893.

937
00:40:43,740 --> 00:40:47,740
 So was it a live programme, or so you didn't request?

938
00:40:47,740 --> 00:40:51,820
 You had to tune in at, let's say, noon for the headlines, and if you missed the headlines,

939
00:40:51,820 --> 00:40:54,460
 you might get the column later on, or the crossword.

940
00:40:54,460 --> 00:40:57,680
 Yeah, there was no record option, you can go to it later on.

941
00:40:57,680 --> 00:40:58,680
 That's brilliant.

942
00:40:58,680 --> 00:40:59,680
 That's incredible.

943
00:40:59,680 --> 00:41:04,400
 Even in the 1920s, 10,000 people were signed up to the system in Hungary, where you called

944
00:41:04,400 --> 00:41:05,400
 up to get your news.

945
00:41:05,400 --> 00:41:08,200
 That's amazing, but do you remember when the internet first started, and it was through

946
00:41:08,200 --> 00:41:12,720
 telephone lines, and anyone was making a call, you couldn't use the internet?

947
00:41:12,720 --> 00:41:13,720
 Yes, yes.

948
00:41:13,720 --> 00:41:15,840
 Well, it would be the same here, if someone was listening to the news, you wouldn't be

949
00:41:15,840 --> 00:41:16,840
 able to make a call.

950
00:41:16,840 --> 00:41:18,880
 That would be really annoying, wouldn't it?

951
00:41:18,880 --> 00:41:19,880
 Yes.

952
00:41:19,880 --> 00:41:20,880
 Yeah.

953
00:41:20,880 --> 00:41:25,060
 So the telephone wires were laid between Buckingham Palace and a bunch of concert halls in London,

954
00:41:25,060 --> 00:41:28,560
 so that the royal family, whenever they wanted to, could listen to a concert.

955
00:41:28,560 --> 00:41:29,560
 Cool.

956
00:41:29,560 --> 00:41:32,180
 Without having to, because it was a bit lowering to go into a music hall, for instance, if you're

957
00:41:32,180 --> 00:41:37,300
 the Queen Victoria, you know, you definitely wouldn't go into a music hall.

958
00:41:37,300 --> 00:41:40,280
 Even having a phone line laid to a music hall is, I think, a bit undignified.

959
00:41:40,280 --> 00:41:43,180
 Wow, you are one of the snobs of the 1890s.

960
00:41:43,180 --> 00:41:49,100
 If there's a raucous, naughty performance, maybe you can't see her getting naked as well.

961
00:41:49,100 --> 00:41:54,080
 She's probably just enjoying the "da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da" as a great tune.

962
00:41:54,080 --> 00:41:57,880
 But I guess if, yeah, it depends on the venues, I suppose, as in some venues, I'm sure we're

963
00:41:57,880 --> 00:41:58,880
 very reputable.

964
00:41:58,880 --> 00:42:00,440
 There must have been some reputable music hall.

965
00:42:00,440 --> 00:42:04,280
 Well, she wasn't doing a phone call to some sort of a pub in Soho.

966
00:42:04,280 --> 00:42:07,560
 It was going to be a guinea minute for this phone call, ma'am, are you sure?

967
00:42:07,560 --> 00:42:11,520
 It wasn't a sex line, okay, but it was so that...

968
00:42:11,520 --> 00:42:15,080
 She was saying Queen Victoria didn't have a sex line installed in Buckingham Palace.

969
00:42:15,080 --> 00:42:18,160
 Not that we know of, but we can't be sure.

970
00:42:18,160 --> 00:42:21,880
 But it was for the slightly more improper performances that it wouldn't do to be seen

971
00:42:21,880 --> 00:42:22,880
 at.

972
00:42:22,880 --> 00:42:23,880
 Who knows?

973
00:42:23,880 --> 00:42:24,880
 That's so cool.

974
00:42:24,880 --> 00:42:26,580
 On music platforms these days.

975
00:42:26,580 --> 00:42:32,300
 So obviously, huge music platforms, you know, like Spotify and things like that.

976
00:42:32,300 --> 00:42:36,740
 One growing and rapidly growing music platform is Peloton Bikes.

977
00:42:36,740 --> 00:42:37,740
 Oh, yeah.

978
00:42:37,740 --> 00:42:38,740
 Yeah.

979
00:42:38,740 --> 00:42:39,740
 Like, they've all got...

980
00:42:39,740 --> 00:42:43,420
 They've got licensing deals and they've got their own in-house music department specifically

981
00:42:43,420 --> 00:42:44,420
 to license...

982
00:42:44,420 --> 00:42:46,380
 Oh, do you mean Exercise Bikes?

983
00:42:46,380 --> 00:42:47,380
 The brand Peloton?

984
00:42:47,380 --> 00:42:48,380
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

985
00:42:48,380 --> 00:42:49,380
 It's in...

986
00:42:49,380 --> 00:42:53,880
 Not anyone in the TARDO France because anyone who's not in the lead, but it's in the main

987
00:42:53,880 --> 00:42:54,880
 group.

988
00:42:54,880 --> 00:42:55,880
 They have to carry a big boot.

989
00:42:55,880 --> 00:42:59,880
 Yeah, there's the yellow headphones and whoever's in the lead on the TARDO France gets to listen

990
00:42:59,880 --> 00:43:00,880
 to the music.

991
00:43:00,880 --> 00:43:01,880
 Oh, of course.

992
00:43:01,880 --> 00:43:02,880
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

993
00:43:02,880 --> 00:43:06,760
 No, but the Prince, as in the musician Prince, dead now, but the Grateful Dead, confusingly

994
00:43:06,760 --> 00:43:12,120
 I think a lot of him is still alive, and Beyonce, they've all licensed their music specifically

995
00:43:12,120 --> 00:43:16,560
 to Peloton for massive amounts of money because it gets used in the exercise classes.

996
00:43:16,560 --> 00:43:19,900
 So this is the forefront of streaming is Exercise Bikes basically.

997
00:43:19,900 --> 00:43:22,140
 But it's not exclusive tracks, is it?

998
00:43:22,140 --> 00:43:23,620
 No, you can still get them on Spotify.

999
00:43:23,620 --> 00:43:24,620
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1000
00:43:24,620 --> 00:43:25,620
 You can.

1001
00:43:25,620 --> 00:43:29,340
 So in the early days, I think Peloton was just using a lot of the music in their exercise

1002
00:43:29,340 --> 00:43:33,260
 classes and obviously they're making money out of these exercise classes and I think

1003
00:43:33,260 --> 00:43:35,780
 it was a big old fuss about it.

1004
00:43:35,780 --> 00:43:36,780
 Well, that's a big...

1005
00:43:36,780 --> 00:43:40,500
 I mean, I think we've said that Guitar Hero with certain bands like Aerosmith were making

1006
00:43:40,500 --> 00:43:44,140
 more money from the licensing deal that they did for that than they would make on their

1007
00:43:44,140 --> 00:43:45,140
 records.

1008
00:43:45,140 --> 00:43:46,140
 Yeah, that's a big industry now.

1009
00:43:46,140 --> 00:43:50,080
 Would you want to, I don't know much Grateful Dead, I know a bit of Prince and it's weird

1010
00:43:50,080 --> 00:43:51,480
 and I don't know if I'd want to cycle to it.

1011
00:43:51,480 --> 00:43:53,600
 Beyonce can totally see the cycling...

1012
00:43:53,600 --> 00:43:56,720
 Yeah, she's really the queen of Peloton.

1013
00:43:56,720 --> 00:44:01,440
 You can get Beyonce-themed classes specifically to do on your bike.

1014
00:44:01,440 --> 00:44:04,720
 And riding your bike, of course, gives you an amazing arse, which is what she already

1015
00:44:04,720 --> 00:44:05,720
 has.

1016
00:44:05,720 --> 00:44:07,720
 So that's something to strive for while you're riding.

1017
00:44:07,720 --> 00:44:13,440
 I just see that from somebody who cycles a lot, by the way, and you basically cycle

1018
00:44:13,440 --> 00:44:16,820
 every day and you're like, "You know what, people who cycle amazing arse."

1019
00:44:16,820 --> 00:44:18,820
 Oh, my God, that is rock hard.

1020
00:44:18,820 --> 00:44:22,780
 I'm sitting on two boulders right now.

1021
00:44:22,780 --> 00:44:32,220
 Okay, it's time for our final fact of the show, and that is Andy.

1022
00:44:32,220 --> 00:44:37,580
 My fact is that Australian Aboriginal people sometimes built objects specifically to arouse

1023
00:44:37,580 --> 00:44:39,900
 the curiosity of emus.

1024
00:44:39,900 --> 00:44:45,320
 Well, it wasn't nice of them.

1025
00:44:45,320 --> 00:44:46,320
 It was naughty.

1026
00:44:46,320 --> 00:44:48,080
 Well, it wasn't naughty either.

1027
00:44:48,080 --> 00:44:49,080
 It was just a spicy.

1028
00:44:49,080 --> 00:44:52,680
 Well, as they say in Australia, "Curiosity kills the emu."

1029
00:44:52,680 --> 00:44:53,680
 Yeah, exactly.

1030
00:44:53,680 --> 00:44:58,520
 And it did kill the emu in this case, but the unborn emus in the egg.

1031
00:44:58,520 --> 00:44:59,520
 That feels worse.

1032
00:44:59,520 --> 00:45:05,560
 Well, this is maybe the worst way I've ever introduced the fact of the show.

1033
00:45:05,560 --> 00:45:06,560
 There are these things.

1034
00:45:06,560 --> 00:45:08,860
 The emu crawlers and Aboriginal peoples were built them.

1035
00:45:08,860 --> 00:45:13,140
 They're cylinders of carved wood, and when you bang the end with the flat of your hand,

1036
00:45:13,140 --> 00:45:18,220
 it produces a sound which apparently is reasonably like the noise of a female emu.

1037
00:45:18,220 --> 00:45:22,140
 And this has to be a female emu as well because with emus, the male is the one who sits on

1038
00:45:22,140 --> 00:45:26,220
 the eggs and nurses them towards, incubates them.

1039
00:45:26,220 --> 00:45:27,540
 That's the thing.

1040
00:45:27,540 --> 00:45:32,660
 And so one hunter will hide in the bush playing this thing, making the noise of a female,

1041
00:45:32,660 --> 00:45:33,660
 banging away.

1042
00:45:33,660 --> 00:45:38,540
 And the male will say, "Oh, a female emu," and go and explore.

1043
00:45:38,540 --> 00:45:43,040
 And then his colleague, the man in the bush's colleague, will steal the emu's eggs without

1044
00:45:43,040 --> 00:45:46,360
 being pecked to death, and that is absolutely the name of the game when you're hunting.

1045
00:45:46,360 --> 00:45:48,400
 And so then you've got a lovely emu omelet.

1046
00:45:48,400 --> 00:45:49,400
 Feed four people.

1047
00:45:49,400 --> 00:45:51,200
 Feed four people.

1048
00:45:51,200 --> 00:45:56,840
 And the other way it was used sometimes is to distract a mob of females, and you can

1049
00:45:56,840 --> 00:45:59,860
 move them to one place where you want them to go so you can shoot them.

1050
00:45:59,860 --> 00:46:03,040
 So it was used by hunters sometimes as well.

1051
00:46:03,040 --> 00:46:07,060
 So I will say the father, in Andy's case, kind of had it coming because he was going

1052
00:46:07,060 --> 00:46:09,060
 to cheat on the mother of his children, right?

1053
00:46:09,060 --> 00:46:11,800
 Yeah, but you know what's happening at the same time.

1054
00:46:11,800 --> 00:46:16,860
 Like when a male emu is incubating the eggs, the woman's off shagging other emus.

1055
00:46:16,860 --> 00:46:17,860
 It's true.

1056
00:46:17,860 --> 00:46:22,260
 And not only that, she shags the other emu, gets a baby in an egg, and then slips it under

1057
00:46:22,260 --> 00:46:23,260
 the other father.

1058
00:46:23,260 --> 00:46:24,260
 Yeah.

1059
00:46:24,260 --> 00:46:25,260
 It's all complicated.

1060
00:46:25,260 --> 00:46:26,340
 There's no villain in this piece.

1061
00:46:26,340 --> 00:46:27,340
 Oh, no.

1062
00:46:27,340 --> 00:46:28,340
 No villain.

1063
00:46:28,340 --> 00:46:30,540
 I thought the male was the villain a while ago, Anna.

1064
00:46:30,540 --> 00:46:32,060
 She can store sperm as well, right?

1065
00:46:32,060 --> 00:46:35,360
 Like multiple different sperm that she can then revert like this.

1066
00:46:35,360 --> 00:46:36,360
 You've got to sort of larder.

1067
00:46:36,360 --> 00:46:37,360
 I didn't know that.

1068
00:46:37,360 --> 00:46:38,360
 I catch it.

1069
00:46:38,360 --> 00:46:39,360
 That's what I read.

1070
00:46:39,360 --> 00:46:41,920
 It sounds like Dan's saying there's a kind of cupboard inside the female emu.

1071
00:46:41,920 --> 00:46:42,920
 That's kind of how it works.

1072
00:46:42,920 --> 00:46:43,920
 Yeah.

1073
00:46:43,920 --> 00:46:44,920
 But can she select?

1074
00:46:44,920 --> 00:46:47,560
 I think he'll have a little bit of Tony today and then fertilize from him.

1075
00:46:47,560 --> 00:46:48,560
 I don't think so.

1076
00:46:48,560 --> 00:46:53,020
 I don't think there's a sort of like spice shelf for the difference.

1077
00:46:53,020 --> 00:46:57,580
 But the male doesn't eat or drink or defecate during the incubation of the eggs, which is

1078
00:46:57,580 --> 00:46:58,580
 56 days.

1079
00:46:58,580 --> 00:47:03,700
 I'm not going to judge him for hearing a female and thinking, "Oh, I wonder..."

1080
00:47:03,700 --> 00:47:07,580
 So he doesn't have time to poo, but he does have the chance to shag another female.

1081
00:47:07,580 --> 00:47:08,580
 Yeah.

1082
00:47:08,580 --> 00:47:09,580
 It's all about priorities.

1083
00:47:09,580 --> 00:47:10,580
 Yeah, isn't it?

1084
00:47:10,580 --> 00:47:12,700
 How appealing is he going to be to that female?

1085
00:47:12,700 --> 00:47:15,380
 It hasn't showered in 50 days.

1086
00:47:15,380 --> 00:47:18,380
 Bows on leash immediately.

1087
00:47:18,380 --> 00:47:23,540
 There's a slight advantage for the males, I think, when the females can bring other eggs

1088
00:47:23,540 --> 00:47:28,420
 back and make him incubate them, even though they don't belong to him, because if he's sitting

1089
00:47:28,420 --> 00:47:32,460
 on his own eggs, but also some other dad's eggs, if the eggs get attacked, at least it

1090
00:47:32,460 --> 00:47:34,820
 raises the chances that someone else's kids will be lost.

1091
00:47:34,820 --> 00:47:35,820
 Oh, okay.

1092
00:47:35,820 --> 00:47:36,820
 That's pretty dark.

1093
00:47:36,820 --> 00:47:37,820
 Yeah.

1094
00:47:37,820 --> 00:47:41,580
 I suppose one of the thing is, the first eggs to hatch will be his eggs, right?

1095
00:47:41,580 --> 00:47:46,760
 Because he was the first one there, and that means that when all of the kids have hatched,

1096
00:47:46,760 --> 00:47:51,500
 his will be the oldest and perhaps the strongest, so that might help as well.

1097
00:47:51,500 --> 00:47:55,260
 Because the male looks after the chicks for, I think, about seven months.

1098
00:47:55,260 --> 00:47:59,580
 It's a long old time that the male is doing the carry-off, and sometimes we'll take on

1099
00:47:59,580 --> 00:48:03,500
 other chicks which got lost from other broods.

1100
00:48:03,500 --> 00:48:04,500
 Yeah, right.

1101
00:48:04,500 --> 00:48:10,940
 This object that they make, if you can imagine a didgeridoo, it's like a small didgeridoo,

1102
00:48:10,940 --> 00:48:16,300
 and it's sometimes known as a woman's didgeridoo, because it's a small version of it, and they're

1103
00:48:16,300 --> 00:48:17,420
 made in the same way.

1104
00:48:17,420 --> 00:48:23,220
 So they're not necessarily made by the humans, they're kind of naturally made by ants eating

1105
00:48:23,220 --> 00:48:26,820
 out the middle of a trunk, and then decorated.

1106
00:48:26,820 --> 00:48:31,220
 And they do sound, if you listen to a didgeridoo, so I haven't heard what the emu cooler sounds

1107
00:48:31,220 --> 00:48:35,380
 like, but I imagine it's a slightly higher-pitched version of a didgeridoo, they do sound a bit

1108
00:48:35,380 --> 00:48:36,380
 like emus.

1109
00:48:36,380 --> 00:48:41,460
 Like, the emu noise is very kind of like something grunting underwater, I thought, which is a

1110
00:48:41,460 --> 00:48:47,340
 little bit like a didgeridoo, but it's not the only way to attract an emu if you're in

1111
00:48:47,340 --> 00:48:48,340
 the business.

1112
00:48:48,340 --> 00:48:49,340
 Really?

1113
00:48:49,340 --> 00:48:50,340
 Yeah.

1114
00:48:50,340 --> 00:48:51,340
 It must be.

1115
00:48:51,340 --> 00:48:52,340
 Myriad ways.

1116
00:48:52,340 --> 00:48:53,660
 Oh, God, there are a lot of ways.

1117
00:48:53,660 --> 00:48:54,660
 Yeah.

1118
00:48:54,660 --> 00:48:57,180
 Des Fallon called himself the world champion emu cooler in the '90s.

1119
00:48:57,180 --> 00:48:59,500
 I can't find any official record of that.

1120
00:48:59,500 --> 00:49:04,220
 I think it might have just been self-styled, but he said, and this does work, and lots

1121
00:49:04,220 --> 00:49:09,020
 of people do it now, you lie on your back and you wave your legs in the air, kind of like

1122
00:49:09,020 --> 00:49:13,300
 a turtle that's been turned over, and you sort of make a noise like a strangled cat sort

1123
00:49:13,300 --> 00:49:18,220
 of grunting noise, and halfway between it being in pain and being in love, I think one

1124
00:49:18,220 --> 00:49:19,220
 researcher said.

1125
00:49:19,220 --> 00:49:20,220
 That's amazing.

1126
00:49:20,220 --> 00:49:23,700
 So that's a good version or take on that, which is that you lay on your back and you

1127
00:49:23,700 --> 00:49:28,780
 put one leg in the air with your foot in that position that it looks like it's an emu's

1128
00:49:28,780 --> 00:49:33,900
 head, and it confuses the emu into thinking it's another emu, and it comes over to investigate

1129
00:49:33,900 --> 00:49:34,900
 you.

1130
00:49:34,900 --> 00:49:35,900
 Because they're so stupid.

1131
00:49:35,900 --> 00:49:39,260
 Apparently, they're so stupid according to a big research study that was done.

1132
00:49:39,260 --> 00:49:43,340
 I can tell you that emus do really like, they're like shiny objects a lot.

1133
00:49:43,340 --> 00:49:47,700
 So if you put a disco ball in a tree, emus will stare at it for hours on end.

1134
00:49:47,700 --> 00:49:48,700
 Really?

1135
00:49:48,700 --> 00:49:49,700
 Really?

1136
00:49:49,700 --> 00:49:51,220
 And then once, a bit of macarena?

1137
00:49:51,220 --> 00:49:55,620
 Well, I think this has been, a similar thing has been used in hunting them.

1138
00:49:55,620 --> 00:50:01,300
 So again, traditional aboriginal hunters will lure emus by hanging a ball of emu feathers

1139
00:50:01,300 --> 00:50:06,140
 and rags from a tree, which I guess must catch the light, or I mean, it certainly looks weird

1140
00:50:06,140 --> 00:50:07,860
 and it's an unusual object for them.

1141
00:50:07,860 --> 00:50:10,660
 And they just gather around it and they're captivated, at which point you can throw a

1142
00:50:10,660 --> 00:50:12,060
 spear at them and kill them.

1143
00:50:12,060 --> 00:50:14,580
 Is that not because they're all going, "Hang on, we're flightless.

1144
00:50:14,580 --> 00:50:17,460
 How did that emu get up in the tree?"

1145
00:50:17,460 --> 00:50:19,580
 She's cracked it.

1146
00:50:19,580 --> 00:50:22,940
 Hey Barry, what was the trick?

1147
00:50:22,940 --> 00:50:23,940
 Come on.

1148
00:50:23,940 --> 00:50:24,940
 That's so good.

1149
00:50:24,940 --> 00:50:25,940
 They can't fly.

1150
00:50:25,940 --> 00:50:30,920
 They do when they run, they still sort of wave their tiny little wings that they have.

1151
00:50:30,920 --> 00:50:34,660
 They think they're not fully sure why they do this from the article I read.

1152
00:50:34,660 --> 00:50:38,240
 The suggestion is it's a balance thing to help them with the speed because they can go

1153
00:50:38,240 --> 00:50:40,420
 very, very fast.

1154
00:50:40,420 --> 00:50:44,100
 But I did read that when they have, because they have predators like dingoes and eagles

1155
00:50:44,100 --> 00:50:45,980
 and so on in Australia.

1156
00:50:45,980 --> 00:50:51,060
 And one way that they fight against a dingo is they leap into the air and they just start

1157
00:50:51,060 --> 00:50:55,500
 stomping them, sort of like just jumping on their head and shoving them into the ground.

1158
00:50:55,500 --> 00:50:56,500
 They've got claws.

1159
00:50:56,500 --> 00:50:57,500
 Nice.

1160
00:50:57,500 --> 00:51:00,340
 But it's just such a wonderful fighting style touch.

1161
00:51:00,340 --> 00:51:01,340
 The tantrum.

1162
00:51:01,340 --> 00:51:02,780
 It's a toddler tantrum.

1163
00:51:02,780 --> 00:51:08,940
 Just on emu penises, which are rare, but, no, sorry, they're not rare for emus.

1164
00:51:08,940 --> 00:51:09,940
 Every emu.

1165
00:51:09,940 --> 00:51:10,940
 Every emu.

1166
00:51:10,940 --> 00:51:14,380
 Half of emus have an emu penis.

1167
00:51:14,380 --> 00:51:16,540
 Nobody else has an emu penis.

1168
00:51:16,540 --> 00:51:21,540
 But birds with penises are rare because 97% of bird species don't have them and emus

1169
00:51:21,540 --> 00:51:22,900
 are in the rare.

1170
00:51:22,900 --> 00:51:27,540
 But they don't have blood in their penises or when they have an erection, it doesn't

1171
00:51:27,540 --> 00:51:28,540
 fill up with blood.

1172
00:51:28,540 --> 00:51:35,620
 It fills with lymphatic fluid, which is very unusual and it's also low pressure.

1173
00:51:35,620 --> 00:51:36,620
 Yeah.

1174
00:51:36,620 --> 00:51:38,860
 So they can't keep an erection for very long.

1175
00:51:38,860 --> 00:51:43,820
 But one interesting thing about that is that the other birds that have penises also are

1176
00:51:43,820 --> 00:51:44,820
 lymph-based.

1177
00:51:44,820 --> 00:51:45,820
 Yeah.

1178
00:51:45,820 --> 00:51:51,500
 And so that means that the earliest ancestor of these two lineages of penis birds must have

1179
00:51:51,500 --> 00:51:55,580
 also had a limp lymph penis.

1180
00:51:55,580 --> 00:51:59,940
 And what that means is that it was some time, a long time ago, and what came before the

1181
00:51:59,940 --> 00:52:01,980
 birds, the dinosaurs.

1182
00:52:01,980 --> 00:52:07,020
 And so if we ever find out that a dinosaur had a penis and at the moment we haven't found

1183
00:52:07,020 --> 00:52:11,140
 it in the fossil record, but if we ever do, there's a good chance that it would also be

1184
00:52:11,140 --> 00:52:12,140
 a lymph-based.

1185
00:52:12,140 --> 00:52:13,140
 Ah, interesting.

1186
00:52:13,140 --> 00:52:14,140
 Wow.

1187
00:52:14,140 --> 00:52:15,140
 Yeah.

1188
00:52:15,140 --> 00:52:19,300
 I saw a picture of an incredible penis the other day and it was sent to me by John Blasch's

1189
00:52:19,300 --> 00:52:20,500
 Snell, the explorer.

1190
00:52:20,500 --> 00:52:23,900
 Was it his?

1191
00:52:23,900 --> 00:52:26,700
 You really should probably block him.

1192
00:52:26,700 --> 00:52:30,020
 His only fan's account is really, really cool.

1193
00:52:30,020 --> 00:52:31,700
 This is a great explorer.

1194
00:52:31,700 --> 00:52:36,380
 He's a friend of the podcast and he showed me a picture of a bat that he'd caught out.

1195
00:52:36,380 --> 00:52:39,100
 I think it was in the Amazon somewhere, ginormous.

1196
00:52:39,100 --> 00:52:40,700
 It looked like it was as tall as us basically.

1197
00:52:40,700 --> 00:52:42,780
 Did he catch it by the penis?

1198
00:52:42,780 --> 00:52:46,860
 He might as well have, because this bat was hung unlike anything I've seen.

1199
00:52:46,860 --> 00:52:50,060
 It was like a human penis on a bat.

1200
00:52:50,060 --> 00:52:51,060
 It was insane.

1201
00:52:51,060 --> 00:52:52,620
 I'll show you the photo later.

1202
00:52:52,620 --> 00:52:53,620
 It's truly extraordinary.

1203
00:52:53,620 --> 00:52:54,620
 I'm all right, actually.

1204
00:52:54,620 --> 00:52:55,620
 Are you?

1205
00:52:55,620 --> 00:52:56,620
 Okay, Andy.

1206
00:52:56,620 --> 00:52:57,620
 I'll get it to you.

1207
00:52:57,620 --> 00:53:00,860
 I wonder, because they hang upside down a lot, I'm just trying to think of...

1208
00:53:00,860 --> 00:53:02,860
 It would just keep bashing them in the face.

1209
00:53:02,860 --> 00:53:08,420
 I thought it was windy here.

1210
00:53:08,420 --> 00:53:11,020
 Did you guys read the Emu story from earlier this year?

1211
00:53:11,020 --> 00:53:12,020
 No.

1212
00:53:12,020 --> 00:53:13,020
 It was only a month ago, I think.

1213
00:53:13,020 --> 00:53:15,540
 It was Malmesbury in Wiltshire.

1214
00:53:15,540 --> 00:53:16,540
 Where I used to live.

1215
00:53:16,540 --> 00:53:17,540
 Really?

1216
00:53:17,540 --> 00:53:18,540
 Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1217
00:53:18,540 --> 00:53:19,540
 Very exciting.

1218
00:53:19,540 --> 00:53:21,060
 I wish I'd still lived there for this story.

1219
00:53:21,060 --> 00:53:26,300
 Well, there was a man who crashed his car into a shop front and he was with an accomplice.

1220
00:53:26,300 --> 00:53:30,940
 He ran away from the scene of the crash because he was incredibly drunk and incredibly high,

1221
00:53:30,940 --> 00:53:31,940
 I think.

1222
00:53:31,940 --> 00:53:36,340
 He was incredibly in charge of a car, crashed it into a building, legged it, and the chef

1223
00:53:36,340 --> 00:53:39,700
 of the local hotel was a guy called Dean Wade, saw him do this, thought, "I'm not letting

1224
00:53:39,700 --> 00:53:40,860
 someone get away with that.

1225
00:53:40,860 --> 00:53:41,860
 That's terrible."

1226
00:53:41,860 --> 00:53:42,860
 Chased after him.

1227
00:53:42,860 --> 00:53:43,860
 They ran away.

1228
00:53:43,860 --> 00:53:46,860
 They ran for quite some distance and they ended up at the edge of the local wildlife enclosure,

1229
00:53:46,860 --> 00:53:48,740
 which has a field full of Emus.

1230
00:53:48,740 --> 00:53:50,780
 And Dean Wade shouted, "Don't go in there.

1231
00:53:50,780 --> 00:53:51,780
 There are Emus."

1232
00:53:51,780 --> 00:53:52,780
 And the guy said, "I'm going in there.

1233
00:53:52,780 --> 00:53:53,780
 I'll take on the Emus."

1234
00:53:53,780 --> 00:53:56,620
 And the Emus absolutely, they pecked him a new one.

1235
00:53:56,620 --> 00:53:58,740
 They really went for him.

1236
00:53:58,740 --> 00:54:02,460
 He shouldn't have lain on his back and flailed around in the air.

1237
00:54:02,460 --> 00:54:06,540
 He was trying to do kung fu kicks and karate chops on this Emus, and the Emus was absolutely

1238
00:54:06,540 --> 00:54:10,580
 just dodging all of it and pecking and pecking and pecking him, and he was apprehended this

1239
00:54:10,580 --> 00:54:11,580
 man.

1240
00:54:11,580 --> 00:54:14,340
 I think we're crediting the Emus with the apprehension right, because the fact that

1241
00:54:14,340 --> 00:54:17,140
 this guy, the chef, is still in full chef's guard.

1242
00:54:17,140 --> 00:54:21,740
 He knew that the Emus could take care of it, so he was then free to go get the police.

1243
00:54:21,740 --> 00:54:23,460
 Was he sort of shepherding them towards the Emus?

1244
00:54:23,460 --> 00:54:26,540
 I'm not sure if it was a deliberate conscious thought, but I think when it happened he thought

1245
00:54:26,540 --> 00:54:27,540
 that's a stroke of luck.

1246
00:54:27,540 --> 00:54:29,340
 I wonder if he was okay with this guy?

1247
00:54:29,340 --> 00:54:30,340
 I think he's fine.

1248
00:54:30,340 --> 00:54:31,340
 Yeah, he's been alright.

1249
00:54:31,340 --> 00:54:32,340
 He lived.

1250
00:54:32,340 --> 00:54:35,340
 I wonder if the chef was torn to get the police, or to then go and steal the eggs from the

1251
00:54:35,340 --> 00:54:36,340
 next.

1252
00:54:36,340 --> 00:54:37,340
 Yeah, you're right.

1253
00:54:37,340 --> 00:54:38,340
 That would be great for the cocktail.

1254
00:54:38,340 --> 00:54:40,060
 Have we ever done the Emu War?

1255
00:54:40,060 --> 00:54:41,060
 Yeah, we have.

1256
00:54:41,060 --> 00:54:42,060
 Have we on the show?

1257
00:54:42,060 --> 00:54:45,260
 No, it was in International Factball, which I think isn't canon.

1258
00:54:45,260 --> 00:54:50,580
 Well, the interesting thing about it is when we mentioned it, did we mention that it's

1259
00:54:50,580 --> 00:54:51,580
 basically a myth?

1260
00:54:51,580 --> 00:54:52,580
 Is it?

1261
00:54:52,580 --> 00:54:53,580
 No way.

1262
00:54:53,580 --> 00:54:59,220
 So the idea is that Australia went to war against the Emus and lost, and far be it from

1263
00:54:59,220 --> 00:55:05,420
 me to back up the Australians, but it turns out that basically it was one Western Australian

1264
00:55:05,420 --> 00:55:10,100
 governor did declare war on the Emus, but didn't send all of his guys out there.

1265
00:55:10,100 --> 00:55:17,100
 He sent three people out to attack all these Emus, three men, a pickup truck and two machine

1266
00:55:17,100 --> 00:55:21,540
 guns, and that was against 20,000 Emus.

1267
00:55:21,540 --> 00:55:25,980
 And basically what had happened was there had been the war, the Second World War, and

1268
00:55:25,980 --> 00:55:30,220
 the Australian government had given land to a lot of veterans, but the land was really

1269
00:55:30,220 --> 00:55:31,220
 dry, it was really barren.

1270
00:55:31,220 --> 00:55:36,220
 They couldn't really grow anything apart from wheat, and the Emus loved wheat, so the Emus

1271
00:55:36,220 --> 00:55:40,180
 were going after the wheat, and the governor of Western Australia decided, well, we're

1272
00:55:40,180 --> 00:55:42,660
 going to declare war on them, and we're going to shoot them.

1273
00:55:42,660 --> 00:55:44,500
 Well, because they've got all these veterans living there.

1274
00:55:44,500 --> 00:55:45,620
 Well, that's what they thought.

1275
00:55:45,620 --> 00:55:49,620
 They thought we'll send three of our actual army guys, and we'll get all of the veterans

1276
00:55:49,620 --> 00:55:53,740
 to come in as well, but actually really, I mean, there was no chance that they were

1277
00:55:53,740 --> 00:55:54,740
 ever going to do anything.

1278
00:55:54,740 --> 00:55:59,180
 I think it was Major Meredith, who was the guy in charge of them, and he said, basically

1279
00:55:59,180 --> 00:56:03,140
 the birds could keep running even after they'd been shot, and so there was very little chance

1280
00:56:03,140 --> 00:56:04,460
 of them winning this engagement.

1281
00:56:04,460 --> 00:56:08,820
 Well, the other thing is like, if you had a big mob of Emus, let's say there's a hundred

1282
00:56:08,820 --> 00:56:14,260
 in a mob, as soon as you shot them, they split up into two fifties, and it was like the Gremlins

1283
00:56:14,260 --> 00:56:15,740
 when they get water on them.

1284
00:56:15,740 --> 00:56:20,860
 It's like being attacked by a worm, and you chop it up, and you just keep making it worse.

1285
00:56:20,860 --> 00:56:24,100
 And Meredith said after he said, if we had a military division with the bullet carrying

1286
00:56:24,100 --> 00:56:30,420
 capacity of these birds, it would face any army in the world.

1287
00:56:30,420 --> 00:56:33,780
 And really the reason that it became a big deal is because it was the time of the Great

1288
00:56:33,780 --> 00:56:38,580
 Depression, and the Great Emu War was kind of a funny story that they could have in the

1289
00:56:38,580 --> 00:56:39,980
 newspapers all the time.

1290
00:56:39,980 --> 00:56:40,980
 Yeah, right.

1291
00:56:40,980 --> 00:56:41,980
 It is funny.

1292
00:56:41,980 --> 00:56:42,980
 And it is funny.

1293
00:56:42,980 --> 00:56:43,980
 It is.

1294
00:56:43,980 --> 00:56:44,980
 That's amazing.

1295
00:56:44,980 --> 00:56:45,980
 That's not quite true.

1296
00:56:45,980 --> 00:56:46,980
 That's incredible.

1297
00:56:46,980 --> 00:56:49,660
 I feel like Aussies get so much crap for the Emu War, so now there you go, you can come

1298
00:56:49,660 --> 00:56:50,660
 back up people with.

1299
00:56:50,660 --> 00:56:52,020
 We only sent three old blokes in there.

1300
00:56:52,020 --> 00:56:53,020
 Exactly.

1301
00:56:53,020 --> 00:56:56,000
 And I have to say, on Twitter, this is probably the most requested story that people sent

1302
00:56:56,000 --> 00:56:58,620
 to me saying, have you guys ever spoken about the Emu War?

1303
00:56:58,620 --> 00:56:59,620
 It's just constantly...

1304
00:56:59,620 --> 00:57:00,620
 So there you go.

1305
00:57:00,620 --> 00:57:01,620
 You're welcome, Australia, isn't it?

1306
00:57:01,620 --> 00:57:02,620
 Yeah.

1307
00:57:02,620 --> 00:57:11,620
 Considering you cheat so much at cricket, you should be very glad to have said this.

1308
00:57:11,620 --> 00:57:12,620
 Okay, that's it.

1309
00:57:12,620 --> 00:57:13,620
