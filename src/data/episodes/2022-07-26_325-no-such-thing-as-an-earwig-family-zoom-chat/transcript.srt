1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,100
 Oh no, they're not gonna wake me up.

2
00:00:06,100 --> 00:00:10,360
 Oh no, they're not gonna wake me up.

3
00:00:10,360 --> 00:00:19,500
 Hello and welcome to another episode of No Such Thing as a Fish, a weekly podcast coming

4
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:23,260
 to you from four undisclosed locations in the UK.

5
00:00:23,260 --> 00:00:24,260
 My name is Dan Schreiber.

6
00:00:24,260 --> 00:00:29,140
 I am sitting here with Andrew Hunter Murray, James Harkin, and Anna Tajinsky, and once

7
00:00:29,140 --> 00:00:33,100
 again, we have gathered around the microphones with our four favorite facts from the last

8
00:00:33,100 --> 00:00:37,500
 seven days, and in a particular order, here we go.

9
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:39,900
 Starting with you, Andy.

10
00:00:39,900 --> 00:00:44,700
 My fact is that Paris's first public transport system failed because wealthy passengers bought

11
00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:48,940
 all the seats for themselves and then persuaded the government to ban poor people.

12
00:00:48,940 --> 00:00:49,940
 Wow.

13
00:00:49,940 --> 00:00:50,940
 Incredible.

14
00:00:50,940 --> 00:00:56,140
 But if they were selling all the tickets, surely that's not a failure.

15
00:00:56,140 --> 00:01:00,580
 Well, then the rich apparently does lost interest and then stopped using it, and then no one

16
00:01:00,580 --> 00:01:01,580
 was using it.

17
00:01:01,580 --> 00:01:03,420
 So it was a complete disaster.

18
00:01:03,420 --> 00:01:07,740
 This is from an article on Lapham's Quarterly, which is an amazing website.

19
00:01:07,740 --> 00:01:08,740
 It's really brilliant.

20
00:01:08,740 --> 00:01:12,700
 It's got so many fascinating things on it, and it's partly based on this brilliant sounding

21
00:01:12,700 --> 00:01:17,660
 book about buses, which is called "Engine of Modernity" by Masha Belenky.

22
00:01:17,660 --> 00:01:21,940
 Andy, have you already moved on from Fennicular Railways then?

23
00:01:21,940 --> 00:01:25,900
 I'm afraid so.

24
00:01:25,900 --> 00:01:34,060
 So this was called The Carrots, and it was set up by Blaise Pascal.

25
00:01:34,060 --> 00:01:37,740
 So we briefly actually mentioned before that Blaise Pascal set up the first public transport

26
00:01:37,740 --> 00:01:40,980
 system in Paris, but I didn't know what happened to it.

27
00:01:40,980 --> 00:01:44,420
 And it was basically a carriage with eight passengers and two staff, and they were rude.

28
00:01:44,420 --> 00:01:45,420
 I'm sorry, when was it?

29
00:01:45,420 --> 00:01:46,420
 Did you say?

30
00:01:46,420 --> 00:01:47,420
 Oh, I'm sorry.

31
00:01:47,420 --> 00:01:48,420
 It was in 1662.

32
00:01:48,420 --> 00:01:50,980
 And who was Blaise Pascal again?

33
00:01:50,980 --> 00:01:57,980
 He was a thinker, mathematician, probability dude, and what's Paris again?

34
00:01:57,980 --> 00:02:01,900
 I'm sorry, who were you?

35
00:02:01,900 --> 00:02:06,860
 Anyway, the point is, wealthy riders didn't like sharing with poor people.

36
00:02:06,860 --> 00:02:11,060
 I think they weren't even, I think, really poor people were not even allowed on in the first

37
00:02:11,060 --> 00:02:12,060
 place.

38
00:02:12,060 --> 00:02:15,500
 So I think wealthy people didn't like even sharing with the middle classes.

39
00:02:15,500 --> 00:02:18,860
 And so they would buy up all the seats in the carriage for themselves.

40
00:02:18,860 --> 00:02:21,860
 And it lasted, I think, a few weeks.

41
00:02:21,860 --> 00:02:26,620
 It was this really weird attempt to set up public transport, which didn't work because social

42
00:02:26,620 --> 00:02:27,940
 hierarchy just got in line.

43
00:02:27,940 --> 00:02:31,820
 Oh, I think it lasted a bit longer than that, because they had quite a few different routes

44
00:02:31,820 --> 00:02:32,820
 by the end.

45
00:02:32,820 --> 00:02:33,820
 So they started off.

46
00:02:33,820 --> 00:02:34,980
 It was Blaise Pascal.

47
00:02:34,980 --> 00:02:40,300
 He put the money in, along with a few other people, including the Duke of Roane.

48
00:02:40,300 --> 00:02:48,060
 And the first route went from Pascal's house to the Duke of Roane's house, just by coincidence.

49
00:02:48,060 --> 00:02:51,380
 And it went through the centre of Paris, but it did pick people up on the way.

50
00:02:51,380 --> 00:02:55,340
 And then they, I think they had three or four other lines, and then they even had a circle

51
00:02:55,340 --> 00:02:57,500
 line that connected all of them.

52
00:02:57,500 --> 00:03:04,740
 And it was carried on going even after Pascal died, but once he died, it kind of went off.

53
00:03:04,740 --> 00:03:11,060
 And they banned, the government banned soldiers and pages and other kind of livery to people

54
00:03:11,060 --> 00:03:12,540
 in uniform kind of people.

55
00:03:12,540 --> 00:03:16,740
 And when they banned those, everyone rioted against it, and that's kind of when it all

56
00:03:16,740 --> 00:03:18,020
 fell out of favour.

57
00:03:18,020 --> 00:03:23,380
 So this is what I did, because I read that, and I didn't quite understand why people wanted

58
00:03:23,380 --> 00:03:24,980
 men in uniform banned.

59
00:03:24,980 --> 00:03:27,220
 Well, they were the middle class, basically.

60
00:03:27,220 --> 00:03:32,260
 A men in uniform would be not the working class, but not the, not the post shows.

61
00:03:32,260 --> 00:03:36,100
 They'd be the in between people that you didn't really want to, want to mix with.

62
00:03:36,100 --> 00:03:37,100
 Right.

63
00:03:37,100 --> 00:03:39,940
 So they had, they had a fashion ban on the bus, then, right?

64
00:03:39,940 --> 00:03:46,500
 Did they have people, was it the doctor's job, or the bus driver's job to go, "I'm sorry,

65
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:48,180
 you don't look good enough for my bus."

66
00:03:48,180 --> 00:03:51,580
 Or did you have to provide more concrete evidence, because you can be quite a good looking

67
00:03:51,580 --> 00:03:52,580
 tailor.

68
00:03:52,580 --> 00:03:56,580
 Surely you had to provide your CV, or maybe some really references from the former boys

69
00:03:56,580 --> 00:03:58,540
 or something, and it was to get on the bus.

70
00:03:58,540 --> 00:04:01,580
 I don't really know how they managed to police it, to be honest.

71
00:04:01,580 --> 00:04:02,580
 I suppose.

72
00:04:02,580 --> 00:04:08,280
 I suppose that the other, the other posh people on the bus would go, "That man is a livery

73
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:09,280
 man."

74
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:12,580
 Yeah, livery is pretty easy to spot.

75
00:04:12,580 --> 00:04:13,580
 Yeah.

76
00:04:13,580 --> 00:04:16,260
 You could, you know what livery is when you say, "There was actually, I do know one thing

77
00:04:16,260 --> 00:04:20,060
 about how it was police, which is that you could be whipped if you interfered with the operations

78
00:04:20,060 --> 00:04:21,060
 of the bus."

79
00:04:21,060 --> 00:04:22,060
 Wow.

80
00:04:22,060 --> 00:04:23,060
 Oh.

81
00:04:23,060 --> 00:04:24,060
 Yeah.

82
00:04:24,060 --> 00:04:25,060
 Quite right, too.

83
00:04:25,060 --> 00:04:26,060
 I mean, you could still be arrested.

84
00:04:26,060 --> 00:04:29,420
 I think if you try to interfere with the operations of a public bus today, if you climb onto

85
00:04:29,420 --> 00:04:32,740
 the driver's lap and take control of the wheel, you are in trouble.

86
00:04:32,740 --> 00:04:33,740
 That's true.

87
00:04:33,740 --> 00:04:37,900
 And there probably is still some sort of fashion laws with modern-day London buses.

88
00:04:37,900 --> 00:04:43,500
 Like, if I went on nude, that might be seen as worthy of not allowing me on.

89
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:44,500
 True.

90
00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:45,500
 Yeah.

91
00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:48,060
 I just don't know it.

92
00:04:48,060 --> 00:04:52,420
 And this really did sort of fall by the wayside, the idea of public transport for a long time,

93
00:04:52,420 --> 00:04:53,420
 didn't it?

94
00:04:53,420 --> 00:04:56,180
 So obviously you could get coaches and you could, you could hire lots if you could hire a

95
00:04:56,180 --> 00:05:01,420
 private coach or get on a post-chase or whatever, but the idea that a bus would have a specific

96
00:05:01,420 --> 00:05:05,380
 route and you knew when it was going to be wet and you could wait there and pick it up.

97
00:05:05,380 --> 00:05:10,700
 Then didn't come back until 1828, I think, in Europe and in Nantes.

98
00:05:10,700 --> 00:05:13,660
 That's a long gap between buses, isn't it?

99
00:05:13,660 --> 00:05:14,660
 Yeah.

100
00:05:14,660 --> 00:05:21,180
 If you just missed the last one in the 1690s and you're like, OK, I'll wait for the next one.

101
00:05:21,180 --> 00:05:22,380
 It's there on the schedule.

102
00:05:22,380 --> 00:05:23,380
 What?

103
00:05:23,380 --> 00:05:24,380
 Wait?

104
00:05:24,380 --> 00:05:25,380
 Oh, it's fine.

105
00:05:25,380 --> 00:05:26,380
 1828.

106
00:05:26,380 --> 00:05:27,380
 It's only 1747 now.

107
00:05:27,380 --> 00:05:28,380
 That's fine.

108
00:05:28,380 --> 00:05:30,380
 No, it's not the clock.

109
00:05:30,380 --> 00:05:32,820
 1828, too, suddenly came at once.

110
00:05:32,820 --> 00:05:35,140
 It was the classic.

111
00:05:35,140 --> 00:05:37,900
 But he didn't even want it to be a public transport system.

112
00:05:37,900 --> 00:05:38,900
 Really, did he?

113
00:05:38,900 --> 00:05:43,540
 This was a guy called Stanislas Bordry and he had a bathhouse and he basically just

114
00:05:43,540 --> 00:05:48,660
 wanted to get people to his bathhouse and so he put on a public bus in order to transport

115
00:05:48,660 --> 00:05:51,580
 them there and he realised people were getting on it, but they're not getting in the bath

116
00:05:51,580 --> 00:05:52,580
 at the end.

117
00:05:52,580 --> 00:05:58,580
 That would be quite useful for your new bus drives, Stan, you have to get changed when

118
00:05:58,580 --> 00:06:01,900
 you get to the bathhouse.

119
00:06:01,900 --> 00:06:06,060
 It would be amazing if you could get a bus which was going to the swimming pool and

120
00:06:06,060 --> 00:06:09,260
 the bus just ended up in the swimming pool and you could just swim out.

121
00:06:09,260 --> 00:06:10,260
 Oh, like a piece.

122
00:06:10,260 --> 00:06:11,260
 You know what I mean?

123
00:06:11,260 --> 00:06:17,380
 It just goes in and then the bus goes out of the ramp or the swimmers who finish get off.

124
00:06:17,380 --> 00:06:21,660
 Like in the Italian job, is it where there's a bus kind of gets to the edge of the cliff

125
00:06:21,660 --> 00:06:25,660
 at the end and you could kind of jump off the bus and dive into the water?

126
00:06:25,660 --> 00:06:26,660
 That's quite cool.

127
00:06:26,660 --> 00:06:27,660
 Yeah.

128
00:06:27,660 --> 00:06:30,060
 You need to have people, have you seen that movie James?

129
00:06:30,060 --> 00:06:33,780
 Have I fuck?

130
00:06:33,780 --> 00:06:41,180
 You should write a book about films because you are knowledgeable, but you've seen

131
00:06:41,180 --> 00:06:42,180
 none of them.

132
00:06:42,180 --> 00:06:43,180
 It's great.

133
00:06:43,180 --> 00:06:48,740
 The 19th century buses, when they came back, they were the first ones that had an upper deck,

134
00:06:48,740 --> 00:06:49,740
 which was really cool.

135
00:06:49,740 --> 00:06:54,620
 So the upper deck, you could go there for half price, but only if you were a man, they wouldn't

136
00:06:54,620 --> 00:07:00,340
 let women go up there and the reason was because it was deemed unbecoming for a woman

137
00:07:00,340 --> 00:07:03,820
 to go up there in the big skirts that they were wearing and even actually impossible because

138
00:07:03,820 --> 00:07:08,780
 it was like a ladder to get to the top deck and also because it was completely in the open.

139
00:07:08,780 --> 00:07:12,660
 So most of the time you just get drenched by rain or wind or whatever, so it was deemed

140
00:07:12,660 --> 00:07:14,660
 unbecoming for women to get drenched.

141
00:07:14,660 --> 00:07:17,820
 Is that because if someone's following you up the stairs, they see up your dress to your

142
00:07:17,820 --> 00:07:18,820
 panties?

143
00:07:18,820 --> 00:07:23,500
 Well, that might have been some of that in there because actually when they brought the

144
00:07:23,500 --> 00:07:29,980
 public transport into France the second time, it kind of became a thing where it was giving

145
00:07:29,980 --> 00:07:36,580
 women more chance to move around and it was associated with like transgression in women.

146
00:07:36,580 --> 00:07:40,940
 Like a lot of whenever any kind of freedom got given to women in history, like people thought,

147
00:07:40,940 --> 00:07:42,900
 "Oh, this must be a terrible thing."

148
00:07:42,900 --> 00:07:47,700
 Yeah, but as James is saying as well, there's a suggestion, which I think is a very, it's

149
00:07:47,700 --> 00:07:52,820
 a more jokey suggestion that the skirts, the frames of those giant hoop skirts would be

150
00:07:52,820 --> 00:07:55,540
 so large they physically couldn't fit them.

151
00:07:55,540 --> 00:08:00,300
 They would get stuck on the way up, but yeah, but as a result, it became quite a social

152
00:08:00,300 --> 00:08:05,740
 place, the bus and there was sort of known bus perverts who would sort of just hang out

153
00:08:05,740 --> 00:08:07,860
 just so that they could be around all these women.

154
00:08:07,860 --> 00:08:12,740
 I'm so worried, Dan, that you've alighted immediately that it became quite a social place

155
00:08:12,740 --> 00:08:14,860
 and there were these bus perverts.

156
00:08:14,860 --> 00:08:19,180
 So that's the definition of a social place is if you've got a good pervert there, holding

157
00:08:19,180 --> 00:08:20,180
 court.

158
00:08:20,180 --> 00:08:29,780
 I mean, it led to bus pervertism where you would have guys would just spend the whole day

159
00:08:29,780 --> 00:08:35,540
 on the bus and if another lady came on, they would sit next to her or be squashed up next

160
00:08:35,540 --> 00:08:42,300
 to someone, it was the perfect way for the pervert to suddenly have access to a bunch of women,

161
00:08:42,300 --> 00:08:43,300
 which was a big problem.

162
00:08:43,300 --> 00:08:47,620
 Not saying it is a good thing, guys, but the bad buses are quite sociable.

163
00:08:47,620 --> 00:08:48,620
 Now aren't they?

164
00:08:48,620 --> 00:08:49,780
 The Venger bus, for instance.

165
00:08:49,780 --> 00:08:50,780
 Yeah.

166
00:08:50,780 --> 00:08:53,380
 The bus, the bus is Spice World the movie.

167
00:08:53,380 --> 00:08:54,380
 They all had a pervert.

168
00:08:54,380 --> 00:08:59,180
 The acquaintance with buses is from film, even though you don't watch film.

169
00:08:59,180 --> 00:09:02,940
 I just think it is a social thing, the bus, isn't it?

170
00:09:02,940 --> 00:09:03,940
 True.

171
00:09:03,940 --> 00:09:05,300
 Have you seen Spice World the movie?

172
00:09:05,300 --> 00:09:07,380
 No, I obviously haven't seen Spice World the movie.

173
00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:10,540
 I haven't either, but it's got Richard E. Grant, isn't it?

174
00:09:10,540 --> 00:09:11,540
 He's the bus driver.

175
00:09:11,540 --> 00:09:12,540
 He's the manager.

176
00:09:12,540 --> 00:09:13,540
 Yeah.

177
00:09:13,540 --> 00:09:15,340
 Oh, yeah, but does he also drive the bus?

178
00:09:15,340 --> 00:09:17,220
 I think at what point he does drive the bus, yeah.

179
00:09:17,220 --> 00:09:18,220
 Okay.

180
00:09:18,220 --> 00:09:23,180
 So does Victoria Beckham, but I don't call her the bus driver in the movie.

181
00:09:23,180 --> 00:09:25,820
 Summer holiday with Cliff Richard, that I had a bus in it.

182
00:09:25,820 --> 00:09:26,820
 Yep.

183
00:09:26,820 --> 00:09:27,820
 Yeah.

184
00:09:27,820 --> 00:09:30,820
 I think the Spice World won a Stanley clear coach by the definitions we're running by.

185
00:09:30,820 --> 00:09:32,140
 It's not like anyone could board.

186
00:09:32,140 --> 00:09:36,620
 It's not that Spice Girls paid their 180 fat, got on, and there's lots of other people

187
00:09:36,620 --> 00:09:37,620
 got on and off.

188
00:09:37,620 --> 00:09:41,460
 Didn't the Spice Girls buy out all the seats in that bus, so no one else could get on it?

189
00:09:41,460 --> 00:09:42,460
 Yeah.

190
00:09:42,460 --> 00:09:43,460
 That's right.

191
00:09:43,460 --> 00:09:46,260
 Imagine how long it would take to tour the country if all the buses taking the

192
00:09:46,260 --> 00:09:50,460
 bans around with public buses.

193
00:09:50,460 --> 00:09:55,380
 We got three hours to get there, but we've got 40 stops along the way.

194
00:09:55,380 --> 00:09:58,540
 Can I tell you guys a personal, something personal?

195
00:09:58,540 --> 00:09:59,540
 Yeah.

196
00:09:59,540 --> 00:10:00,540
 Oh, boy.

197
00:10:00,540 --> 00:10:05,100
 I was recently reading an old copy of the Pickwick Papers that I found.

198
00:10:05,100 --> 00:10:06,620
 I think my parents asked ages ago.

199
00:10:06,620 --> 00:10:09,220
 Well, no, I think I inherited it from my grandma.

200
00:10:09,220 --> 00:10:15,100
 Anyway, I opened it to one page, and there was a bus ticket in there, or a tram ticket, sorry.

201
00:10:15,100 --> 00:10:16,980
 It's just a scrap of tram ticket.

202
00:10:16,980 --> 00:10:22,940
 It's from London United tramways, so I looked that up, and that ran from 1894 to 1933.

203
00:10:22,940 --> 00:10:27,500
 And it's punched for a journey in the sort of Wimbledon Kingston area.

204
00:10:27,500 --> 00:10:28,700
 And it says it costs two pennies.

205
00:10:28,700 --> 00:10:30,220
 It was 2D.

206
00:10:30,220 --> 00:10:31,220
 And isn't that cool?

207
00:10:31,220 --> 00:10:32,500
 And I don't know who owned it.

208
00:10:32,500 --> 00:10:37,060
 And I looked at that one, like, looking up the, when the ticket was from, when those stops

209
00:10:37,060 --> 00:10:39,580
 existed, and also the advert on the other side.

210
00:10:39,580 --> 00:10:44,140
 So on the other side, there's an advert for Holloway's magic ointment, or Holloway's

211
00:10:44,140 --> 00:10:45,140
 all-rounder ointment.

212
00:10:45,140 --> 00:10:46,140
 Okay.

213
00:10:46,140 --> 00:10:47,980
 I think it's from 1900.

214
00:10:47,980 --> 00:10:48,980
 Wow.

215
00:10:48,980 --> 00:10:49,980
 What does this ointment do?

216
00:10:49,980 --> 00:10:51,580
 That's what I'm getting from the story.

217
00:10:51,580 --> 00:10:53,420
 It cures absolutely everything, James.

218
00:10:53,420 --> 00:10:54,420
 It's an all-round remedy.

219
00:10:54,420 --> 00:11:00,740
 It's literally said, backache, heart attacks, brain disease, vomiting.

220
00:11:00,740 --> 00:11:01,740
 It's all there.

221
00:11:01,740 --> 00:11:04,860
 Actually, then I went on a stupid rabbit hole that was made by a guy called Thomas Holloway,

222
00:11:04,860 --> 00:11:06,780
 and it made him super rich.

223
00:11:06,780 --> 00:11:13,820
 And so he bought this mansion called Tittonhurst Park, and that, Dan, you do recognise it.

224
00:11:13,820 --> 00:11:15,420
 Why do you recognise it?

225
00:11:15,420 --> 00:11:16,420
 The Beatles?

226
00:11:16,420 --> 00:11:17,420
 Yeah.

227
00:11:17,420 --> 00:11:19,460
 Apparently John Lennon lived there a hundred years after him.

228
00:11:19,460 --> 00:11:20,460
 Yeah, wow.

229
00:11:20,460 --> 00:11:26,060
 So that was a convoluted way that I got to John Lennon via this fact.

230
00:11:26,060 --> 00:11:27,060
 But anyway, isn't that cool?

231
00:11:27,060 --> 00:11:29,740
 I've got a bus ticket from 120 years ago.

232
00:11:29,740 --> 00:11:30,740
 That is very cool.

233
00:11:30,740 --> 00:11:31,740
 I think so.

234
00:11:31,740 --> 00:11:34,140
 Do you know, can I give a quick personal story?

235
00:11:34,140 --> 00:11:40,900
 When I went to Zanzibar on Honeymoon, suddenly coming up next, did you find a bus ticket

236
00:11:40,900 --> 00:11:45,900
 that used to belong to Freddie Mercury or something?

237
00:11:45,900 --> 00:11:52,620
 No, next to me is Anna's grandmother driving a bus, I just couldn't believe it.

238
00:11:52,620 --> 00:11:57,740
 Next to me is a bus that I used to get, not obviously the exact bus, but a bus that I

239
00:11:57,740 --> 00:12:00,340
 used to get in Hong Kong as a kid.

240
00:12:00,340 --> 00:12:04,700
 And I suddenly looked around and all the buses in Zanzibar were the old buses from Hong

241
00:12:04,700 --> 00:12:06,100
 Kong, from my childhood.

242
00:12:06,100 --> 00:12:07,100
 Wow.

243
00:12:07,100 --> 00:12:11,420
 And I think when buses are put out of, you know, when new buses come in to say London

244
00:12:11,420 --> 00:12:14,700
 or whatever, they shift out all these buses to all these different countries.

245
00:12:14,700 --> 00:12:15,700
 Yeah.

246
00:12:15,700 --> 00:12:16,700
 And Zanzibar.

247
00:12:16,700 --> 00:12:17,700
 That is awesome.

248
00:12:17,700 --> 00:12:19,300
 All the old London buses went to Macau, I think.

249
00:12:19,300 --> 00:12:22,700
 So if you, they might not be there anymore, about 10 years ago, if you went on a bus in

250
00:12:22,700 --> 00:12:24,860
 Macau, they were old London buses.

251
00:12:24,860 --> 00:12:25,860
 Wow.

252
00:12:25,860 --> 00:12:30,100
 And the Bendy buses, I think we've said before, they went somewhere super inappropriate.

253
00:12:30,100 --> 00:12:31,100
 Yeah.

254
00:12:31,100 --> 00:12:37,860
 I don't mean like they went to a sex club, but I mean they went to a place where they were

255
00:12:37,860 --> 00:12:46,420
 at the bus.

256
00:12:46,420 --> 00:12:52,420
 Can I quickly tell you the most desperate ever press release I found about buses?

257
00:12:52,420 --> 00:12:53,420
 Okay.

258
00:12:53,420 --> 00:12:57,260
 This was at the time the James Bond film Spectre was coming out.

259
00:12:57,260 --> 00:13:00,400
 The press releases by National Express, the bus company.

260
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:04,860
 So often sophisticated James Bond is unquestionably one of the most glamorous characters of all time,

261
00:13:04,860 --> 00:13:09,100
 but was the world's most famous by named after a humble bus?

262
00:13:09,100 --> 00:13:12,460
 It's a question National Express hopes to answer once and for all.

263
00:13:12,460 --> 00:13:15,580
 We know where he got his name James Bond.

264
00:13:15,580 --> 00:13:16,580
 I know.

265
00:13:16,580 --> 00:13:17,580
 I know.

266
00:13:17,580 --> 00:13:19,100
 But the 007 bit, I mean.

267
00:13:19,100 --> 00:13:20,100
 Oh, right.

268
00:13:20,100 --> 00:13:21,100
 Okay.

269
00:13:21,100 --> 00:13:22,100
 Sorry, yeah.

270
00:13:22,100 --> 00:13:25,260
 The National Express 007 coach service, which was formerly a bus route when it was taken

271
00:13:25,260 --> 00:13:29,420
 over in 1973, operates nine times daily between Deal and Victoria.

272
00:13:29,420 --> 00:13:34,620
 It has rumored Bond author Fleming was inspired by the destination blind of his local bus to adopt

273
00:13:34,620 --> 00:13:38,860
 the number and they go on and on and on about it.

274
00:13:38,860 --> 00:13:42,540
 And they even got a National Express driver to say, well, James Bond is more likely to be

275
00:13:42,540 --> 00:13:44,180
 seen behind the wheel of a Bentley.

276
00:13:44,180 --> 00:13:48,860
 It's a massive honor to drive the 007 and it certainly attracts a lot of attention.

277
00:13:48,860 --> 00:13:50,300
 It's always a talking point.

278
00:13:50,300 --> 00:13:55,260
 You see heads turning by as you go by and people pointing, they're definitely more passengers

279
00:13:55,260 --> 00:13:57,460
 recently, perhaps because of the new film.

280
00:13:57,460 --> 00:13:59,380
 I would have thought that's definitely the case.

281
00:13:59,380 --> 00:14:12,660
 It turns out that the National Numbering Scheme wasn't actually introduced until the mid-1970s.

282
00:14:12,660 --> 00:14:13,660
 Okay.

283
00:14:13,660 --> 00:14:16,780
 It is time for fact number two and that is Anna.

284
00:14:16,780 --> 00:14:21,060
 My fact this week is that Aladdin is Chinese.

285
00:14:21,060 --> 00:14:22,060
 What?

286
00:14:22,060 --> 00:14:35,900
 Are you doing your own life for the fact now, Anna?

287
00:14:35,900 --> 00:14:36,900
 Thank you.

288
00:14:36,900 --> 00:14:37,900
 I know.

289
00:14:37,900 --> 00:14:38,900
 Right.

290
00:14:38,900 --> 00:14:43,700
 So I decided I wanted to read Aladdin, so I read about this new translation.

291
00:14:43,700 --> 00:14:48,500
 So I bought it recently, opened it and the very first line of the story.

292
00:14:48,500 --> 00:14:50,500
 No bus tickets in there.

293
00:14:50,500 --> 00:14:53,340
 One way to get on a budget carpet.

294
00:14:53,340 --> 00:14:57,740
 It's a bus ticket from Shanghai, which is how I knew.

295
00:14:57,740 --> 00:15:01,380
 The first line is in one of China's vast and wealthy kingdoms.

296
00:15:01,380 --> 00:15:03,940
 I thought this is a shit translation.

297
00:15:03,940 --> 00:15:07,180
 They've got the bloody country wrong, first sentence.

298
00:15:07,180 --> 00:15:10,780
 But turns out it's bang on and he was from China.

299
00:15:10,780 --> 00:15:16,020
 And so the whole story behind Aladdin and the 2001 Arabian Knights, which is what it's

300
00:15:16,020 --> 00:15:22,140
 a part of, is kind of an amazing story of tales being passed from one country to the next.

301
00:15:22,140 --> 00:15:28,300
 So basically it was written down for the first time by a French guy called Antoine Galon.

302
00:15:28,300 --> 00:15:31,060
 And this is in the very early 1700s.

303
00:15:31,060 --> 00:15:35,260
 And he'd been told it by a Syrian who he'd met, a guy from Aleppo.

304
00:15:35,260 --> 00:15:37,620
 And the Syrian had told it as him being a Chinese person.

305
00:15:37,620 --> 00:15:41,660
 So it was told in Arabia, but Aladdin was Chinese.

306
00:15:41,660 --> 00:15:45,540
 And it was just this thing where whenever something is kind of exotic or foreign, we go

307
00:15:45,540 --> 00:15:46,540
 east.

308
00:15:46,540 --> 00:15:49,180
 We seem to just go east when we're telling a story as an exotic or foreign.

309
00:15:49,180 --> 00:15:53,660
 So if you were in Persia, then you wanted to convey that something was like exotic or

310
00:15:53,660 --> 00:15:56,740
 a bit strange, you put it in China, set it in China.

311
00:15:56,740 --> 00:16:03,420
 And I don't know what you do in Chinese, set it in Japan, yeah, Japan, Alaska.

312
00:16:03,420 --> 00:16:04,580
 Is his name Aladdin then?

313
00:16:04,580 --> 00:16:06,620
 Because that's not a very Chinese name.

314
00:16:06,620 --> 00:16:08,460
 No, this is the weird thing about it.

315
00:16:08,460 --> 00:16:11,220
 The details are quite Arabic.

316
00:16:11,220 --> 00:16:16,140
 So they didn't read no much about actual China, but they were just setting it in China.

317
00:16:16,140 --> 00:16:19,180
 So throughout the story, you'll read, you know, he was in one of these classic Chinese

318
00:16:19,180 --> 00:16:20,180
 palaces.

319
00:16:20,180 --> 00:16:23,900
 And then they'll describe the palace and it'll be a combination of an Arabian palace with

320
00:16:23,900 --> 00:16:26,940
 some French influence because it was written down by a French guy.

321
00:16:26,940 --> 00:16:29,900
 Was there a theory that Galon had invented it himself as well?

322
00:16:29,900 --> 00:16:34,500
 Because it took a long time to track down the Syrian who, it's a monk who had told him

323
00:16:34,500 --> 00:16:35,500
 the story.

324
00:16:35,500 --> 00:16:37,500
 Yeah, this is also amazing.

325
00:16:37,500 --> 00:16:38,500
 Yeah.

326
00:16:38,500 --> 00:16:42,660
 I love that this was, this mystery was solved sort of hundreds of years later.

327
00:16:42,660 --> 00:16:48,100
 So yeah, Galon said that he'd, he wrote down a thousand and one nights, the Arabic stories.

328
00:16:48,100 --> 00:16:50,500
 And then people were clamoring for more.

329
00:16:50,500 --> 00:16:54,020
 And so he wrote down some more stories that weren't in the original Arabic version he

330
00:16:54,020 --> 00:16:55,020
 was translating.

331
00:16:55,020 --> 00:16:57,900
 And he said that he'd been told them by this Syrian guy.

332
00:16:57,900 --> 00:17:02,580
 But everyone sort of assumed he'd just made them up and then given them this origin story

333
00:17:02,580 --> 00:17:03,740
 from Syria.

334
00:17:03,740 --> 00:17:08,780
 And then they found the autobiography of the Syrian guy who's called Hannah Diab.

335
00:17:08,780 --> 00:17:12,860
 They found the autobiography in 1993, isn't it, which I just, it's how incredible is that

336
00:17:12,860 --> 00:17:15,460
 sort of 280 years later?

337
00:17:15,460 --> 00:17:19,380
 Does he say it is autobiography, met a French guy today and told him this brilliant story

338
00:17:19,380 --> 00:17:20,700
 about a Chinese guy in the lab?

339
00:17:20,700 --> 00:17:22,700
 He does, he mentions it.

340
00:17:22,700 --> 00:17:25,420
 He does, he mentions it in his memoirs.

341
00:17:25,420 --> 00:17:30,180
 And there is a theory now, a new theory which is that the story of Aladdin might be an

342
00:17:30,180 --> 00:17:32,820
 autobiography of this guy called Diab.

343
00:17:32,820 --> 00:17:37,380
 And he's talking about when he arrived in Paris because he arrived in Versailles and they

344
00:17:37,380 --> 00:17:39,460
 had all these wonderful things.

345
00:17:39,460 --> 00:17:43,580
 And Aladdin is obviously the story of a young boy who kind of gets lots of riches and

346
00:17:43,580 --> 00:17:44,580
 stuff.

347
00:17:44,580 --> 00:17:49,580
 And so it might have been him kind of turning his experiences into an Arabic story.

348
00:17:49,580 --> 00:17:50,580
 Wow.

349
00:17:50,580 --> 00:17:52,860
 Well, definitely influenced by his time in France anyway.

350
00:17:52,860 --> 00:17:56,940
 Because yeah, when Aladdin magics is palessed out of nothing, it's very much Versailles

351
00:17:56,940 --> 00:17:57,940
 influenced.

352
00:17:57,940 --> 00:18:02,220
 It's pretty amazing that this was a very famous text for its time, right?

353
00:18:02,220 --> 00:18:03,740
 The Arabian Nights.

354
00:18:03,740 --> 00:18:05,860
 And then this guy comes along.

355
00:18:05,860 --> 00:18:11,180
 He adds not only probably the most famous story, which is Aladdin, but he also adds the story

356
00:18:11,180 --> 00:18:13,580
 of Ali Barba and the 40 Thieves.

357
00:18:13,580 --> 00:18:19,060
 He adds the seven voyages of Simbad, the sailor, the three most famous stories probably had

358
00:18:19,060 --> 00:18:20,740
 nothing to do with the original.

359
00:18:20,740 --> 00:18:21,740
 It's fanfiction.

360
00:18:21,740 --> 00:18:22,740
 Yeah.

361
00:18:22,740 --> 00:18:26,540
 He added to a book which has suddenly overtaken the book.

362
00:18:26,540 --> 00:18:29,340
 Yeah, he was, it wasn't that famous when he was translating it, was it?

363
00:18:29,340 --> 00:18:30,340
 I don't think.

364
00:18:30,340 --> 00:18:33,020
 And he was kind of the one who made it famous.

365
00:18:33,020 --> 00:18:37,580
 And the problem was like Europe, yeah, yeah, sorry, in Europe for sure.

366
00:18:37,580 --> 00:18:40,220
 But like I kind of said, people wanted more.

367
00:18:40,220 --> 00:18:43,580
 And so his publishers just started going, oh, we'll just write some more, then put them

368
00:18:43,580 --> 00:18:44,900
 in your name.

369
00:18:44,900 --> 00:18:49,420
 So they started taking other stories from Turkey and from other parts of Eastern Europe

370
00:18:49,420 --> 00:18:53,220
 and then putting them in as part of the 1,001 Nights.

371
00:18:53,220 --> 00:18:56,060
 And he's like, no, no, wait, no, don't put those shit ones in.

372
00:18:56,060 --> 00:18:57,060
 I'll give you some more.

373
00:18:57,060 --> 00:18:58,060
 I'll give you some more.

374
00:18:58,060 --> 00:19:00,860
 Like these new ones like Symbad and Aladdin came from.

375
00:19:00,860 --> 00:19:02,660
 That's a good way to threaten an author.

376
00:19:02,660 --> 00:19:05,020
 To threaten to write the sequel really badly.

377
00:19:05,020 --> 00:19:06,020
 That's true.

378
00:19:06,020 --> 00:19:08,260
 They should do that with George R.R. Martin, shouldn't they?

379
00:19:08,260 --> 00:19:11,900
 They should say, we're just going to write the last Game of Thrones.

380
00:19:11,900 --> 00:19:14,700
 We're just going to get E.L. James to write it.

381
00:19:14,700 --> 00:19:17,860
 He's like, no, no, no.

382
00:19:17,860 --> 00:19:21,900
 He also had his windows in Paris pelted with kind of rotten fruit and hard objects

383
00:19:21,900 --> 00:19:23,740
 by people who wanted more stories.

384
00:19:23,740 --> 00:19:27,140
 The reading public was much more demanding in those days.

385
00:19:27,140 --> 00:19:30,380
 Imagine if I'd done that to Hillary Mantell for the last five years,

386
00:19:30,380 --> 00:19:34,060
 just kind of attacking her with various missiles.

387
00:19:34,060 --> 00:19:37,340
 And it wouldn't induce you to want to satisfy your public by writing something.

388
00:19:37,340 --> 00:19:38,180
 But it did.

389
00:19:38,180 --> 00:19:38,940
 And he did.

390
00:19:38,940 --> 00:19:42,140
 But the story that we all know, I would say,

391
00:19:42,140 --> 00:19:47,340
 is as a result of the brilliant animated 1992 movie.

392
00:19:47,340 --> 00:19:49,300
 I think we've all seen that, have we?

393
00:19:49,300 --> 00:19:50,180
 Have we all seen that?

394
00:19:50,180 --> 00:19:51,140
 Yeah, of course, yeah.

395
00:19:51,140 --> 00:19:51,900
 We've all seen that.

396
00:19:51,900 --> 00:19:55,620
 So I'm going to take very quiet over there.

397
00:19:55,620 --> 00:20:01,660
 But yeah, so classic Hollywood distorted the facts of the story,

398
00:20:01,660 --> 00:20:03,420
 bent them to be a different story altogether.

399
00:20:03,420 --> 00:20:07,180
 So in it, Aladdin's not a Norfolk in the original story,

400
00:20:07,180 --> 00:20:08,500
 which he's portrayed as in the movie.

401
00:20:08,500 --> 00:20:09,820
 He lives with his mum.

402
00:20:09,820 --> 00:20:13,580
 And in the original story, it's not just one genie granting wishes.

403
00:20:13,580 --> 00:20:15,260
 It's two genies.

404
00:20:15,260 --> 00:20:18,220
 There's a genie of the lamp and there's a genie of the ring.

405
00:20:18,220 --> 00:20:20,140
 And then it's not three wishes.

406
00:20:20,140 --> 00:20:21,700
 Like, he gets as many wishes.

407
00:20:21,700 --> 00:20:23,020
 He just keeps wishing away.

408
00:20:23,020 --> 00:20:24,220
 Is this having a wishing party?

409
00:20:24,220 --> 00:20:26,940
 Did he do that trick that everyone says they're going to do

410
00:20:26,940 --> 00:20:29,660
 when they're a kid where the first wish is infinite wishes?

411
00:20:29,660 --> 00:20:30,460
 Is that how he does it?

412
00:20:30,460 --> 00:20:32,500
 Oh, yeah.

413
00:20:32,500 --> 00:20:33,220
 It's not allowed.

414
00:20:33,220 --> 00:20:35,300
 The genie specifically bands that are in the Disney film,

415
00:20:35,300 --> 00:20:38,060
 which you wouldn't know if you had watched it, James.

416
00:20:38,060 --> 00:20:40,260
 I really thought that was the rest of it.

417
00:20:40,260 --> 00:20:41,900
 That's so good that it's infinite, though.

418
00:20:41,900 --> 00:20:43,220
 I always thought it was a million.

419
00:20:43,220 --> 00:20:45,660
 How stupid would I have looked with you guys

420
00:20:45,660 --> 00:20:46,900
 as I got to my millionth wish?

421
00:20:46,900 --> 00:20:49,060
 You guys get to carry that one.

422
00:20:49,060 --> 00:20:50,660
 You could just use your millionth wish

423
00:20:50,660 --> 00:20:52,660
 to ask for another million wishes.

424
00:20:52,660 --> 00:20:56,380
 I'm like, Jesus, what are you saying?

425
00:20:56,380 --> 00:20:58,620
 Although you could have asked for a thousand and one

426
00:20:58,620 --> 00:21:01,180
 in Arabic because the reason it's a thousand and one

427
00:21:01,180 --> 00:21:03,100
 nights is actually because that was like an Arabic word

428
00:21:03,100 --> 00:21:05,580
 for infinite, infinite stories.

429
00:21:05,580 --> 00:21:06,620
 It was meant to be.

430
00:21:06,620 --> 00:21:09,940
 Yeah, because if they called it 270 nights, roughly,

431
00:21:09,940 --> 00:21:12,020
 it's not as impressive or sexy, is it?

432
00:21:12,020 --> 00:21:13,100
 It's not.

433
00:21:13,100 --> 00:21:15,860
 But also, no wonder the publishers wanted more stories.

434
00:21:15,860 --> 00:21:19,620
 This is nowhere near the number you've promised.

435
00:21:19,620 --> 00:21:21,420
 Hey, the most striking thing about the story,

436
00:21:21,420 --> 00:21:23,900
 which, as I say, I have just read, and it is great,

437
00:21:23,900 --> 00:21:24,740
 is Aladdin.

438
00:21:24,740 --> 00:21:29,380
 It's a complete dickhead, like not a likable character at all.

439
00:21:29,380 --> 00:21:31,100
 So the reason his dad dies at the start

440
00:21:31,100 --> 00:21:34,060
 is because Aladdin is so lazy and greasy and dissipated

441
00:21:34,060 --> 00:21:36,500
 and cruel that his dad's just devastated

442
00:21:36,500 --> 00:21:39,180
 that he won't follow him in his career path.

443
00:21:39,180 --> 00:21:41,980
 And basically, he just gets really lucky.

444
00:21:41,980 --> 00:21:43,780
 He gets sort of kidnapped by this bloke

445
00:21:43,780 --> 00:21:45,980
 who reveals all these riches to him.

446
00:21:45,980 --> 00:21:49,060
 And then he manages to escape the bloke, the wizard.

447
00:21:49,060 --> 00:21:52,340
 And then just uses all the riches to seduce the princess.

448
00:21:52,340 --> 00:21:54,140
 He falls in love with the princess

449
00:21:54,140 --> 00:21:57,580
 because he hears that she's going to be going to the bath.

450
00:21:57,580 --> 00:22:00,260
 I don't know what number bath she wants to be.

451
00:22:00,260 --> 00:22:01,420
 At the time.

452
00:22:01,420 --> 00:22:03,300
 But he hears she's going to be going to the baths.

453
00:22:03,300 --> 00:22:05,620
 And so he sneaks in to spy on her

454
00:22:05,620 --> 00:22:08,060
 because he's never seen a woman unveiled before.

455
00:22:08,060 --> 00:22:11,900
 She's her face from behind the door, really fancies her.

456
00:22:11,900 --> 00:22:15,180
 And she's going to marry this guy who seems like a really decent bloke,

457
00:22:15,180 --> 00:22:19,340
 the viseous son. And Aladdin, just on their wedding night,

458
00:22:19,340 --> 00:22:21,540
 on the viseous and her wedding night,

459
00:22:21,540 --> 00:22:25,940
 uses the lamp to magic their marriage bed into his own home.

460
00:22:25,940 --> 00:22:27,460
 And then he gets the viseous son out.

461
00:22:27,460 --> 00:22:28,940
 He sends him out to spend the whole night

462
00:22:28,940 --> 00:22:31,100
 in a freezing cold toilet outside

463
00:22:31,100 --> 00:22:32,500
 and then lies with the princess.

464
00:22:32,500 --> 00:22:33,700
 Wow, that's how he seduced him.

465
00:22:33,700 --> 00:22:35,180
 So that's why he's called Aladdin, isn't it?

466
00:22:35,180 --> 00:22:37,460
 Because he's an absolute lad.

467
00:22:37,460 --> 00:22:40,660
 That's the full name is an absolute lad in, yeah.

468
00:22:40,660 --> 00:22:42,860
 An absolute lad gets in there.

469
00:22:42,860 --> 00:22:45,060
 Yeah.

470
00:22:45,060 --> 00:22:48,340
 So, Anna, you haven't been reading the Richard Burton one, right?

471
00:22:48,340 --> 00:22:51,140
 No, this is a new translation, which I would recommend

472
00:22:51,140 --> 00:22:54,140
 because it's by this woman called Yasmin Seal, who is French Syrian,

473
00:22:54,140 --> 00:22:56,580
 which I just love because obviously it was an amalgamation

474
00:22:56,580 --> 00:22:59,980
 of French and Syrian when it was first written.

475
00:22:59,980 --> 00:23:01,500
 But no, not that one.

476
00:23:01,500 --> 00:23:02,020
 Why?

477
00:23:02,020 --> 00:23:04,300
 Because Richard Burton was the, Richard Burton

478
00:23:04,300 --> 00:23:06,700
 the Victorian explorer and linguist.

479
00:23:06,700 --> 00:23:08,260
 He did all these amazing adventures.

480
00:23:08,260 --> 00:23:10,780
 He visited Mecca in disguise once.

481
00:23:10,780 --> 00:23:12,500
 And he would have been killed if he'd been discovered.

482
00:23:12,500 --> 00:23:13,860
 You know, he was an amazing adventurer.

483
00:23:13,860 --> 00:23:19,980
 But Burton wrote a really erotic translation of "The Thousand of One Nights"

484
00:23:19,980 --> 00:23:21,940
 because he also translated the calmasutra

485
00:23:21,940 --> 00:23:26,220
 and he was very sexy.

486
00:23:26,220 --> 00:23:30,500
 Visor the bus pervert of his day, he was.

487
00:23:30,500 --> 00:23:31,980
 But in his version of Aladdin,

488
00:23:31,980 --> 00:23:33,340
 Aladdin's father is impotent.

489
00:23:33,340 --> 00:23:37,140
 And so he takes an opium-based medicine to thicken his semen.

490
00:23:37,140 --> 00:23:38,140
 Jesus.

491
00:23:38,140 --> 00:23:40,660
 That's just a detail of the story.

492
00:23:40,660 --> 00:23:41,340
 Cool.

493
00:23:41,340 --> 00:23:44,500
 I think that's the Holloway's ointment of its day, isn't it?

494
00:23:44,500 --> 00:23:46,980
 [LAUGHTER]

495
00:23:46,980 --> 00:23:49,700
 Yeah, his version had to be privately printed, didn't it?

496
00:23:49,700 --> 00:23:50,420
 It was--

497
00:23:50,420 --> 00:23:51,180
 Yeah, I think it did.

498
00:23:51,180 --> 00:23:52,380
 --because of the sexual content.

499
00:23:52,380 --> 00:23:54,660
 Yeah, you had to-- you couldn't buy it.

500
00:23:54,660 --> 00:23:56,580
 It was through subscription that you had to get it.

501
00:23:56,580 --> 00:23:56,980
 Wow.

502
00:23:56,980 --> 00:23:57,740
 Yeah.

503
00:23:57,740 --> 00:23:59,260
 And I haven't seen the Disney film for a while,

504
00:23:59,260 --> 00:24:01,740
 but I'm pretty sure they didn't leave that element, did they?

505
00:24:01,740 --> 00:24:02,980
 It's strongly implied.

506
00:24:02,980 --> 00:24:06,780
 [LAUGHTER]

507
00:24:06,780 --> 00:24:09,460
 Yeah, he was a pretty crazy character at Richard Burton.

508
00:24:09,460 --> 00:24:11,260
 I'm never sure how I feel about him.

509
00:24:11,260 --> 00:24:13,820
 But he did like to sex things up.

510
00:24:13,820 --> 00:24:16,220
 I suppose he didn't need to sex up the kamasucha too much.

511
00:24:16,220 --> 00:24:17,220
 No.

512
00:24:17,220 --> 00:24:18,820
 He wrote his own-- I think most of what we know about him

513
00:24:18,820 --> 00:24:20,340
 is from his own autobiography, and also

514
00:24:20,340 --> 00:24:22,460
 the biography of his adoring wife.

515
00:24:22,460 --> 00:24:25,700
 And he claimed that he learned Latin fluently at the age of three

516
00:24:25,700 --> 00:24:28,060
 and Greek fluently at the age of four.

517
00:24:28,060 --> 00:24:30,660
 And he could play chess blindfolded.

518
00:24:30,660 --> 00:24:32,940
 And he-- but he was amazing.

519
00:24:32,940 --> 00:24:34,100
 He just sort of traveled everywhere.

520
00:24:34,100 --> 00:24:37,660
 He ended up speaking 40 languages, got in loads of trouble.

521
00:24:37,660 --> 00:24:40,060
 I think he got-- he was a soldier in India.

522
00:24:40,060 --> 00:24:43,340
 And he got kicked out of India, and his life as a soldier

523
00:24:43,340 --> 00:24:45,700
 failed when his governor basically

524
00:24:45,700 --> 00:24:47,540
 asked him to investigate some rumors

525
00:24:47,540 --> 00:24:49,900
 that they'd heard about brothels in the city.

526
00:24:49,900 --> 00:24:51,900
 And because he had an eye for detail,

527
00:24:51,900 --> 00:24:53,900
 especially a lascivious detail, he just

528
00:24:53,900 --> 00:24:56,340
 investigated them way too hard.

529
00:24:56,340 --> 00:24:59,060
 So he spent lots and lots of time in brothels,

530
00:24:59,060 --> 00:25:02,900
 just taking meticulous notes about exactly what was going on.

531
00:25:02,900 --> 00:25:05,660
 And the authorities were like, fuck, this is rank, Richard.

532
00:25:05,660 --> 00:25:06,820
 Oh, go home.

533
00:25:06,820 --> 00:25:08,580
 You are sick.

534
00:25:08,580 --> 00:25:10,500
 And killed is grit.

535
00:25:10,500 --> 00:25:13,100
 Did you know that the queen has played Aladdin?

536
00:25:13,100 --> 00:25:15,700
 It was when she was-- it was during the war.

537
00:25:15,700 --> 00:25:18,140
 During the war, Queen Elizabeth played Aladdin

538
00:25:18,140 --> 00:25:22,620
 in the royal family's pantomime to raise money for soldiers.

539
00:25:22,620 --> 00:25:25,540
 I think they invited a small audience of aristocrats.

540
00:25:25,540 --> 00:25:28,660
 And she would have been in her early teens, I guess, at the time.

541
00:25:28,660 --> 00:25:29,340
 Yeah.

542
00:25:29,340 --> 00:25:32,260
 Queen-- her pre-queens, they call them in the royal family.

543
00:25:32,260 --> 00:25:35,140
 [LAUGHTER]

544
00:25:35,140 --> 00:25:36,100
 And was it with the others?

545
00:25:36,100 --> 00:25:39,460
 And it was, like, Margaret-- the parents or Margaret?

546
00:25:39,460 --> 00:25:43,660
 Margaret was in it, but I don't think she was playing the parents.

547
00:25:43,660 --> 00:25:47,180
 It's like when you're at school, when I was at school,

548
00:25:47,180 --> 00:25:50,580
 in the Nativity Play, when I was in the top,

549
00:25:50,580 --> 00:25:54,060
 yeah, I played Joseph, which was very nice.

550
00:25:54,060 --> 00:25:55,740
 The main part-- main role.

551
00:25:55,740 --> 00:25:57,020
 Yeah, I don't know if you know that.

552
00:25:57,020 --> 00:26:00,100
 Don't know if you know the Nativity story, but it's--

553
00:26:00,100 --> 00:26:01,220
 He's a pretty big deal at it.

554
00:26:01,220 --> 00:26:02,260
 This is a pretty big one.

555
00:26:02,260 --> 00:26:06,060
 My brother, in the same play, played a blade of grass.

556
00:26:06,060 --> 00:26:07,460
 [LAUGHTER]

557
00:26:07,460 --> 00:26:10,220
 Wow.

558
00:26:10,220 --> 00:26:11,740
 Wow.

559
00:26:11,740 --> 00:26:12,420
 Blade of grass.

560
00:26:12,420 --> 00:26:14,420
 They couldn't find a single bigger role

561
00:26:14,420 --> 00:26:16,860
 for him than a single blade of grass.

562
00:26:16,860 --> 00:26:18,340
 Not even a few blades of grass.

563
00:26:18,340 --> 00:26:20,180
 No, there was a few different--

564
00:26:20,180 --> 00:26:23,260
 I don't think he was, like, head blade of grass.

565
00:26:23,260 --> 00:26:26,140
 And he didn't have a speaking role.

566
00:26:26,140 --> 00:26:26,980
 I'm just trying to--

567
00:26:26,980 --> 00:26:28,780
 He didn't understand any blade of grass.

568
00:26:28,780 --> 00:26:32,500
 There's no sentient grass in the story.

569
00:26:32,500 --> 00:26:35,580
 But basically, you had the load of the kids

570
00:26:35,580 --> 00:26:38,260
 would kind of stand there and kind of wave in the breeze

571
00:26:38,260 --> 00:26:39,820
 as if they were a blade of grass.

572
00:26:39,820 --> 00:26:41,820
 I don't remember any grass being mentioned

573
00:26:41,820 --> 00:26:44,060
 in any version of the negativity I've ever heard.

574
00:26:44,060 --> 00:26:46,780
 Well, what did the donkey eat?

575
00:26:46,780 --> 00:26:48,780
 I guess straw?

576
00:26:48,780 --> 00:26:51,060
 What straw if it's not dry grass?

577
00:26:51,060 --> 00:26:52,020
 Yeah, fair enough.

578
00:26:52,020 --> 00:26:54,780
 So where's his role to be eaten by the donkey at some point?

579
00:26:54,780 --> 00:26:58,380
 [LAUGHTER]

580
00:26:58,380 --> 00:27:01,540
 Oh, my goodness.

581
00:27:01,540 --> 00:27:03,900
 OK, it is time for fact number three.

582
00:27:03,900 --> 00:27:05,140
 And that is my fact.

583
00:27:05,140 --> 00:27:07,540
 My fact this week is that merry grounds

584
00:27:07,540 --> 00:27:12,140
 were invented in medieval times for nights to ride on.

585
00:27:12,140 --> 00:27:16,460
 So this is carousels for any Americans listening.

586
00:27:16,460 --> 00:27:19,220
 The merry ground has a very long history.

587
00:27:19,220 --> 00:27:21,780
 It sort of originates back in the 12th century.

588
00:27:21,780 --> 00:27:25,260
 There was a game that was played on horseback

589
00:27:25,260 --> 00:27:30,660
 where a sort of scented ball used to be tossed around to people.

590
00:27:30,660 --> 00:27:33,140
 And if you dropped it, or if it smashed on you,

591
00:27:33,140 --> 00:27:35,020
 it would release a kind of perfume.

592
00:27:35,020 --> 00:27:38,180
 And that perfume would stink you up for the rest of the match.

593
00:27:38,180 --> 00:27:42,820
 And that word was carouselo, which meant little war.

594
00:27:42,820 --> 00:27:44,900
 Carouselo is a sort of bastardization

595
00:27:44,900 --> 00:27:47,980
 of it by the Italians who took it on.

596
00:27:47,980 --> 00:27:52,140
 And then they realized how useful this was in combat training

597
00:27:52,140 --> 00:27:52,860
 purposes.

598
00:27:52,860 --> 00:27:57,060
 And so little war, carouselo slowly

599
00:27:57,060 --> 00:28:01,620
 morphed into nights sitting on what were effectively

600
00:28:01,620 --> 00:28:02,620
 saddles.

601
00:28:02,620 --> 00:28:05,420
 And they would go around a pole on chains.

602
00:28:05,420 --> 00:28:09,020
 And they would have to try and lance with their lances

603
00:28:09,020 --> 00:28:10,380
 a little ring.

604
00:28:10,380 --> 00:28:12,660
 And that was the very beginnings of what

605
00:28:12,660 --> 00:28:14,580
 eventually turned into what we now

606
00:28:14,580 --> 00:28:16,660
 have as the modern day carousel.

607
00:28:16,660 --> 00:28:19,180
 So yeah, it was originally for night training.

608
00:28:19,180 --> 00:28:22,980
 So this game where you throw balls at people.

609
00:28:22,980 --> 00:28:24,660
 And if you drop them, they make you

610
00:28:24,660 --> 00:28:27,860
 smell like perfume.

611
00:28:27,860 --> 00:28:29,700
 What's the point in that?

612
00:28:29,700 --> 00:28:33,460
 I think it's really weird.

613
00:28:33,460 --> 00:28:35,820
 Basically, if you smell like perfume,

614
00:28:35,820 --> 00:28:37,020
 you smell quite nice.

615
00:28:37,020 --> 00:28:39,180
 And the other people will smell like they've been riding around

616
00:28:39,180 --> 00:28:40,340
 on a horse all afternoon.

617
00:28:40,340 --> 00:28:41,740
 They'll be sweaty and disgusting.

618
00:28:41,740 --> 00:28:44,340
 And supposedly, there's perfume people of the losers.

619
00:28:44,340 --> 00:28:45,140
 I say they've won.

620
00:28:45,140 --> 00:28:46,140
 I agree.

621
00:28:46,140 --> 00:28:47,980
 Because I read about this as well.

622
00:28:47,980 --> 00:28:49,700
 And that was the one thing that stuck with me.

623
00:28:49,700 --> 00:28:51,180
 This seems like a pretty stupid--

624
00:28:51,180 --> 00:28:53,500
 a bit like Quidditch being a stupid game.

625
00:28:53,500 --> 00:28:55,780
 This is kind of a stupid game where it's not really

626
00:28:55,780 --> 00:28:59,380
 obvious what the point of winning or losing is.

627
00:28:59,380 --> 00:29:00,820
 I just didn't like it at all.

628
00:29:00,820 --> 00:29:02,580
 You wouldn't say that James about Quidditch

629
00:29:02,580 --> 00:29:06,260
 to the people who play Quidditch in the park near my house.

630
00:29:06,260 --> 00:29:08,820
 And they're not even flying.

631
00:29:08,820 --> 00:29:10,540
 Are they a scary looking bunch?

632
00:29:10,540 --> 00:29:11,820
 They've all got sticks.

633
00:29:11,820 --> 00:29:12,340
 That's true.

634
00:29:12,340 --> 00:29:13,900
 Although the sticks do have to be clamped

635
00:29:13,900 --> 00:29:17,820
 between their legs, otherwise it's easy.

636
00:29:17,820 --> 00:29:19,220
 I think it's the shame of it, right?

637
00:29:19,220 --> 00:29:21,940
 So Andy could sit at the stinking of perfume

638
00:29:21,940 --> 00:29:23,900
 in the dining hall afterwards shrieking.

639
00:29:23,900 --> 00:29:26,260
 I've won in most senses at the word.

640
00:29:26,260 --> 00:29:27,500
 He likes.

641
00:29:27,500 --> 00:29:30,300
 But in the end, everyone knows that you've lost.

642
00:29:30,300 --> 00:29:30,980
 That's true.

643
00:29:30,980 --> 00:29:33,660
 I suppose if you play an actual spot and then you

644
00:29:33,660 --> 00:29:36,580
 go to the pub afterwards, you don't really know who's lost.

645
00:29:36,580 --> 00:29:39,380
 It's not obvious to everyone else in the pub who's lost.

646
00:29:39,380 --> 00:29:40,380
 But then everyone--

647
00:29:40,380 --> 00:29:43,020
 As Anna points out, it is obvious.

648
00:29:43,020 --> 00:29:44,940
 Because any time I finish playing sport,

649
00:29:44,940 --> 00:29:45,740
 I'm the one who's lost.

650
00:29:45,740 --> 00:29:51,140
 It's so early carousels, though.

651
00:29:51,140 --> 00:29:53,380
 They were powered by animals walking in a circle,

652
00:29:53,380 --> 00:29:54,340
 which I had no idea about.

653
00:29:54,340 --> 00:29:56,580
 So instead of, as well as having a fake horse

654
00:29:56,580 --> 00:29:58,980
 that you'd be riding on, there would be a real horse.

655
00:29:58,980 --> 00:30:01,260
 Why don't you just get on the real horse?

656
00:30:01,260 --> 00:30:05,500
 Like, if the whole point is to train how to ride horses,

657
00:30:05,500 --> 00:30:07,340
 and you've got an actual horse there,

658
00:30:07,340 --> 00:30:09,980
 why are you sitting on the fake one?

659
00:30:09,980 --> 00:30:10,740
 Yeah, it's true.

660
00:30:10,740 --> 00:30:11,660
 Very weird.

661
00:30:11,660 --> 00:30:15,260
 Those horses-- I mean, that is so demeaning for those horses.

662
00:30:15,260 --> 00:30:17,300
 Imagine your job being to pull around

663
00:30:17,300 --> 00:30:22,100
 a fake, much less developed version of yourself.

664
00:30:22,100 --> 00:30:24,900
 Well, that's basically taking your child for a walk in the park,

665
00:30:24,900 --> 00:30:25,700
 isn't it?

666
00:30:25,700 --> 00:30:27,860
 [LAUGHTER]

667
00:30:27,860 --> 00:30:30,540
 Because they used to put knights on loose horses

668
00:30:30,540 --> 00:30:31,860
 and sort of push them around.

669
00:30:31,860 --> 00:30:34,420
 They would have squires pulling the horses

670
00:30:34,420 --> 00:30:36,820
 so that they could practice their jousting.

671
00:30:36,820 --> 00:30:38,140
 What do you mean fake horses?

672
00:30:38,140 --> 00:30:38,900
 Like wooden horses?

673
00:30:38,900 --> 00:30:41,220
 Yeah, wooden horses, exactly.

674
00:30:41,220 --> 00:30:45,060
 They would try and hit a target called a quintane, wouldn't they?

675
00:30:45,060 --> 00:30:46,860
 Which we've mentioned on QI a quintane,

676
00:30:46,860 --> 00:30:48,420
 but I don't think we've mentioned here.

677
00:30:48,420 --> 00:30:53,140
 And it basically is a-- it's a wooden post with a target on,

678
00:30:53,140 --> 00:30:55,020
 and the target is on a bit of a lever.

679
00:30:55,020 --> 00:30:57,460
 So when you hit it, it flips around.

680
00:30:57,460 --> 00:31:00,780
 And that was the way that you would test how to do jousting.

681
00:31:00,780 --> 00:31:03,220
 It was a crucial for jousting training,

682
00:31:03,220 --> 00:31:06,220
 but jousting wasn't the most crucial thing that knights

683
00:31:06,220 --> 00:31:07,700
 did in competitions, right?

684
00:31:07,700 --> 00:31:08,980
 I think we've mentioned this on QI.

685
00:31:08,980 --> 00:31:10,780
 But for most of the Middle Ages,

686
00:31:10,780 --> 00:31:12,900
 if you went to a tournament as a knight,

687
00:31:12,900 --> 00:31:16,660
 they did the melee, which was like a very chaotic--

688
00:31:16,660 --> 00:31:19,620
 it's like the Royal Rumble, wasn't it, melee?

689
00:31:19,620 --> 00:31:21,380
 What's the Royal Rumble?

690
00:31:21,380 --> 00:31:25,780
 Well, it began in medieval times.

691
00:31:25,780 --> 00:31:26,980
 Goddamn it.

692
00:31:26,980 --> 00:31:28,460
 That explained what the Royal Rumble is.

693
00:31:28,460 --> 00:31:30,820
 Nana's told us if this is the same as a melee.

694
00:31:30,820 --> 00:31:36,540
 Royal Rumble is a WWE event where you have about 30 wrestlers

695
00:31:36,540 --> 00:31:39,740
 who will all attack each other at the same time in the ring.

696
00:31:39,740 --> 00:31:42,300
 They're staggered in, so you would have someone two people

697
00:31:42,300 --> 00:31:44,980
 started off, and then let's say every two minutes,

698
00:31:44,980 --> 00:31:47,820
 a new person enters the ring, to win the match,

699
00:31:47,820 --> 00:31:50,020
 you have to flip someone over the top rope,

700
00:31:50,020 --> 00:31:51,700
 and they have to make contact with the floor.

701
00:31:51,700 --> 00:31:53,940
 So it's not exactly the same.

702
00:31:53,940 --> 00:31:56,300
 So it's the same way that there's loads of them involved

703
00:31:56,300 --> 00:31:57,740
 or fighting each other, right?

704
00:31:57,740 --> 00:31:58,740
 Yeah, exactly.

705
00:31:58,740 --> 00:32:01,180
 But also, like in the Royal Rumble, in the melee,

706
00:32:01,180 --> 00:32:03,100
 you could kind of sneak in the corner

707
00:32:03,100 --> 00:32:05,300
 and hide under some coats or something,

708
00:32:05,300 --> 00:32:08,460
 and let everyone else beat each other in the fight,

709
00:32:08,460 --> 00:32:10,660
 and then you could jump out at the last minute and fight.

710
00:32:10,660 --> 00:32:14,340
 Classic, classic Sean Michaels tactic of WWF.

711
00:32:14,340 --> 00:32:15,180
 Absolutely.

712
00:32:15,180 --> 00:32:17,900
 Well, he actually got it from the medieval English.

713
00:32:17,900 --> 00:32:21,740
 Are there coats in the corner during a wrestling match?

714
00:32:21,740 --> 00:32:22,980
 It feels like, as you're coming,

715
00:32:22,980 --> 00:32:26,660
 he just, "Oh, leave your coat on the bed, we'll be."

716
00:32:26,660 --> 00:32:28,740
 The English used to be famous for this strategy,

717
00:32:28,740 --> 00:32:31,260
 where if there were lots of different groups around,

718
00:32:31,260 --> 00:32:32,820
 the English would say they weren't going to play.

719
00:32:32,820 --> 00:32:34,780
 They're not interested in the melee at all,

720
00:32:34,780 --> 00:32:36,460
 so that all the other teams would play

721
00:32:36,460 --> 00:32:38,180
 and really, really tie each other out.

722
00:32:38,180 --> 00:32:40,060
 This was around the time of Henry II,

723
00:32:40,060 --> 00:32:42,980
 and once all the other teams are really, really tied out,

724
00:32:42,980 --> 00:32:45,460
 they've been knocked off their horses, they've run out of steam,

725
00:32:45,460 --> 00:32:46,980
 the English suddenly would gallop in,

726
00:32:46,980 --> 00:32:49,020
 and so we'd change our minds of playing, we're playing,

727
00:32:49,020 --> 00:32:52,060
 and then they'd completely vanquished everyone else on the pitch.

728
00:32:52,060 --> 00:32:53,660
 -Wow. -That was what we were known for.

729
00:32:53,660 --> 00:32:56,660
 Well, they probably, they wouldn't invite us back to the next melee,

730
00:32:56,660 --> 00:32:58,020
 would they?

731
00:32:58,020 --> 00:32:59,700
 We were, they're still doing them in France,

732
00:32:59,700 --> 00:33:01,860
 so we just never, we haven't been asked for 800 years.

733
00:33:01,860 --> 00:33:04,740
 -Oh. -But the reason jousting became popular,

734
00:33:04,740 --> 00:33:07,100
 do you know why it was switched to jousting from melee?

735
00:33:07,100 --> 00:33:07,780
 No.

736
00:33:07,780 --> 00:33:11,420
 This is that knights were so violent, they were massive thugs,

737
00:33:11,420 --> 00:33:12,900
 and it was a serious problem.

738
00:33:12,900 --> 00:33:14,780
 So the first ever mass peace movement,

739
00:33:14,780 --> 00:33:16,140
 the peace and truth of God movement,

740
00:33:16,140 --> 00:33:20,140
 was basically to stop knights from killing each other and everyone else.

741
00:33:20,140 --> 00:33:22,900
 And they, so they used to do things like a knights tournament,

742
00:33:22,900 --> 00:33:24,500
 wouldn't just be in one area,

743
00:33:24,500 --> 00:33:26,700
 until the, quite near the end of the Middle Ages,

744
00:33:26,700 --> 00:33:29,220
 a knights tournament would be across the countryside,

745
00:33:29,220 --> 00:33:32,380
 so you have 29, and they're just fighting each other,

746
00:33:32,380 --> 00:33:33,660
 they gallop across the countryside,

747
00:33:33,660 --> 00:33:34,740
 they used to do things like,

748
00:33:34,740 --> 00:33:36,820
 they bash down the doors of peasant's homes,

749
00:33:36,820 --> 00:33:38,020
 and be like, you've got to give me a shelter,

750
00:33:38,020 --> 00:33:39,300
 let me hide in your cupboard,

751
00:33:39,300 --> 00:33:40,460
 and then if another knight came,

752
00:33:40,460 --> 00:33:42,140
 then they'd burn down the peasant's house,

753
00:33:42,140 --> 00:33:44,220
 to burn the knight's house, to get rid of him.

754
00:33:44,220 --> 00:33:45,300
 There's nothing you can do,

755
00:33:45,300 --> 00:33:47,780
 as a peasant, you're obliged to give knights bed and board,

756
00:33:47,780 --> 00:33:48,900
 if they ask for it.

757
00:33:48,900 --> 00:33:50,900
 And they used to ruin people's crops,

758
00:33:50,900 --> 00:33:53,740
 you know, they'd burn down fences and hedges.

759
00:33:53,740 --> 00:33:55,260
 It was just chaos, and so...

760
00:33:55,260 --> 00:33:56,220
 That was amazing.

761
00:33:56,220 --> 00:33:59,100
 It's had super fun, incredibly fun,

762
00:33:59,100 --> 00:34:00,860
 and I think mainly the clergy said,

763
00:34:00,860 --> 00:34:02,580
 this is getting out of control.

764
00:34:02,580 --> 00:34:05,060
 Let's make it one-on-one about the shall we.

765
00:34:05,060 --> 00:34:07,620
 So if you had a house, and the knight came along,

766
00:34:07,620 --> 00:34:10,140
 and they said, we want to stay in your house,

767
00:34:10,140 --> 00:34:11,740
 you had to let them stay.

768
00:34:11,740 --> 00:34:14,020
 It was actually if it was your Lord,

769
00:34:14,020 --> 00:34:15,780
 but yeah, it would usually be that guy,

770
00:34:15,780 --> 00:34:18,340
 and you had to feed them for as long as they wanted feeding,

771
00:34:18,340 --> 00:34:19,460
 and give them somewhere to sleep,

772
00:34:19,460 --> 00:34:20,300
 which was pretty harsh,

773
00:34:20,300 --> 00:34:21,660
 because they obviously had enough to eat,

774
00:34:21,660 --> 00:34:22,940
 and by and large, you didn't.

775
00:34:22,940 --> 00:34:23,900
 Yeah.

776
00:34:23,900 --> 00:34:25,300
 They must have come over and said,

777
00:34:25,300 --> 00:34:26,140
 can I stay with you?

778
00:34:26,140 --> 00:34:27,300
 And you said, how many knights?

779
00:34:27,300 --> 00:34:28,980
 And they said, well, there's 600 others.

780
00:34:28,980 --> 00:34:31,220
 LAUGHTER

781
00:34:31,220 --> 00:34:34,820
 On innovations of how it slowly evolved

782
00:34:34,820 --> 00:34:38,340
 into the modern-day carousel merry-ground that we have,

783
00:34:38,340 --> 00:34:40,140
 I was trying to find at what points

784
00:34:40,140 --> 00:34:42,460
 it sort of turned more and more into what we have,

785
00:34:42,460 --> 00:34:45,340
 and I discovered, now I'm still on the case

786
00:34:45,340 --> 00:34:47,340
 with this investigation, I must say.

787
00:34:47,340 --> 00:34:49,060
 So this might be wrong,

788
00:34:49,060 --> 00:34:53,100
 but I think that the person who invented the device

789
00:34:53,100 --> 00:34:55,860
 that allowed the horse to go up and down the pole

790
00:34:55,860 --> 00:34:57,660
 as it's going round,

791
00:34:57,660 --> 00:34:58,980
 you see, you know what I'm talking about?

792
00:34:58,980 --> 00:35:00,740
 How, yeah, so it's a string fellow.

793
00:35:00,740 --> 00:35:01,740
 Yeah.

794
00:35:01,740 --> 00:35:04,580
 LAUGHTER

795
00:35:04,580 --> 00:35:08,820
 It was a bad called Merlin, which is a nice-- No.

796
00:35:08,820 --> 00:35:13,140
 Yeah, I believe that it was a man called John Joseph Merlin.

797
00:35:13,140 --> 00:35:15,780
 Now, he's been mentioned on the podcast before,

798
00:35:15,780 --> 00:35:18,180
 because he was the man who invented roller skates

799
00:35:18,180 --> 00:35:21,780
 and first displayed them when he played a violin at a party

800
00:35:21,780 --> 00:35:24,140
 and ended up crashing into a giant mirror.

801
00:35:24,140 --> 00:35:26,580
 You remember him, this is that very same man.

802
00:35:26,580 --> 00:35:31,700
 And he was an amazing inventor during his lifetime

803
00:35:31,700 --> 00:35:33,340
 of living in London, particularly.

804
00:35:33,340 --> 00:35:35,580
 He was from Belgium to begin with.

805
00:35:35,580 --> 00:35:37,300
 And he invented all sorts of things

806
00:35:37,300 --> 00:35:40,020
 like a self-propelled wheelchair.

807
00:35:40,020 --> 00:35:43,820
 He had a pedal-operated revolving tea table.

808
00:35:43,820 --> 00:35:46,820
 He had mechanical chariots that used to go around London.

809
00:35:46,820 --> 00:35:50,500
 And he had his own museum, which was called the Merlin's Mechanical

810
00:35:50,500 --> 00:35:55,380
 Museum, and in it is the description of this carousel

811
00:35:55,380 --> 00:35:58,500
 with horses that go up and down and noble people

812
00:35:58,500 --> 00:36:02,100
 and rich people of the time used to come and hire it out,

813
00:36:02,100 --> 00:36:04,500
 specifically just to have rides on it at this place.

814
00:36:04,500 --> 00:36:08,660
 So this is, he died at the beginning of 1800, 1803.

815
00:36:08,660 --> 00:36:10,820
 So we're talking late 1700s here.

816
00:36:10,820 --> 00:36:13,500
 It's the first description that I can find of that innovation

817
00:36:13,500 --> 00:36:16,220
 of the horse going up and down, invented by Merlin.

818
00:36:16,220 --> 00:36:19,740
 So is your theory that Merlin first existed in the 1800s,

819
00:36:19,740 --> 00:36:22,060
 invented that, and then went back in time to King Arthur

820
00:36:22,060 --> 00:36:25,500
 and co, and brought with him his training after the night?

821
00:36:25,500 --> 00:36:28,020
 Well, you've taken the theory further, but I'm on board.

822
00:36:28,020 --> 00:36:30,940
 I absolutely will fold that into the idea.

823
00:36:30,940 --> 00:36:34,420
 And Merlin, I believe, in the Disney Sword and the Stone,

824
00:36:34,420 --> 00:36:37,860
 which is very closely original story, it's not.

825
00:36:37,860 --> 00:36:40,300
 Merlin at the end enters on roller skates.

826
00:36:40,300 --> 00:36:41,420
 Is he?

827
00:36:41,420 --> 00:36:45,420
 So this is all coming together, fairly certain.

828
00:36:45,420 --> 00:36:47,540
 Wow, it's just a shame no one will hear it once, James.

829
00:36:47,540 --> 00:36:48,540
 Is that it?

830
00:36:48,540 --> 00:36:55,900
 Oh, I have a fact about aeroplane rides at a fun fair.

831
00:36:55,900 --> 00:36:59,540
 OK, so the flight simulating aeroplane ride at a fun fair,

832
00:36:59,540 --> 00:37:01,940
 where you sit in a little plane and it moves up

833
00:37:01,940 --> 00:37:03,460
 and left and right and rolls around a bit.

834
00:37:03,460 --> 00:37:06,020
 That was invented to train pilots.

835
00:37:06,020 --> 00:37:07,020
 Wow.

836
00:37:07,020 --> 00:37:07,660
 That is terrifying.

837
00:37:07,660 --> 00:37:14,700
 Genuinely, this was built in the early '30s, I think,

838
00:37:14,700 --> 00:37:17,260
 maybe late '20s, by an event called Lee Ily.

839
00:37:17,260 --> 00:37:20,060
 He built a small plane called the orientator,

840
00:37:20,060 --> 00:37:21,660
 and it would tilt left and right.

841
00:37:21,660 --> 00:37:23,820
 It was in this huge y-shaped fork.

842
00:37:23,820 --> 00:37:27,180
 So the plane was stuck in the y of the fork, as it were.

843
00:37:27,180 --> 00:37:29,500
 And it would turn and roll and twist.

844
00:37:29,500 --> 00:37:32,420
 And he thought this would be useful for training pilots.

845
00:37:32,420 --> 00:37:34,660
 And he only sold five of them, all of them

846
00:37:34,660 --> 00:37:37,500
 to the Cuban government.

847
00:37:37,500 --> 00:37:40,220
 And that's what it was used for.

848
00:37:40,220 --> 00:37:41,940
 And then a friend of his saw it and said,

849
00:37:41,940 --> 00:37:44,260
 have you suggested turning it into a carnival ride?

850
00:37:44,260 --> 00:37:46,140
 Because that looks really fun.

851
00:37:46,140 --> 00:37:48,100
 And that's what he did.

852
00:37:48,100 --> 00:37:49,820
 And he spent the rest of his life inventing

853
00:37:49,820 --> 00:37:52,540
 the Lupo plane and the Rollo plane and the Rocco plane

854
00:37:52,540 --> 00:37:53,540
 and all these rides.

855
00:37:53,540 --> 00:37:54,140
 That's amazing.

856
00:37:54,140 --> 00:37:56,780
 I mean, you've got the carousel, which

857
00:37:56,780 --> 00:37:59,380
 was for training nights, and you've got this for training.

858
00:37:59,380 --> 00:38:02,420
 You know, that big boat that kind of goes up and down

859
00:38:02,420 --> 00:38:03,380
 in a rocking motion.

860
00:38:03,380 --> 00:38:06,260
 Is that to train Vikings or something?

861
00:38:06,260 --> 00:38:07,060
 Yeah.

862
00:38:07,060 --> 00:38:10,780
 That's where Admiral Nelson was going to describe us.

863
00:38:10,780 --> 00:38:14,020
 [MUSIC PLAYING]

864
00:38:14,020 --> 00:38:16,780
 OK, it is time for our final fact of the show.

865
00:38:16,780 --> 00:38:18,900
 And that is James.

866
00:38:18,900 --> 00:38:22,540
 OK, my fact this week is that in some parts of Japan,

867
00:38:22,540 --> 00:38:25,900
 earwigs are known as Chinpo Kiri.

868
00:38:25,900 --> 00:38:30,580
 Literally penis cutters.

869
00:38:30,580 --> 00:38:34,820
 They're much more powerful in Japan.

870
00:38:34,820 --> 00:38:37,700
 I don't think they're literally cutting penises.

871
00:38:37,700 --> 00:38:41,900
 I think it might be-- well, OK, so let me tell you where I found this.

872
00:38:41,900 --> 00:38:44,340
 It basically came up on my RSS feed last week.

873
00:38:44,340 --> 00:38:46,260
 But I went to look for evidence.

874
00:38:46,260 --> 00:38:49,860
 I found a paper from 2013 from a Japanese entomologist

875
00:38:49,860 --> 00:38:54,660
 called Kenta Takada called vulgar dialects names of earwigs

876
00:38:54,660 --> 00:38:57,580
 used in the Kansai region of Japan.

877
00:38:57,580 --> 00:39:01,100
 OK, so I went on to Google Translate

878
00:39:01,100 --> 00:39:02,820
 because this paper was in Japanese.

879
00:39:02,820 --> 00:39:06,020
 And it seems like the reason that they're called this

880
00:39:06,020 --> 00:39:09,340
 is when they have penises in the back earwigs don't they.

881
00:39:09,340 --> 00:39:11,820
 On their bumps, they have like these little penises.

882
00:39:11,820 --> 00:39:14,860
 And also in Japan, in this particular area,

883
00:39:14,860 --> 00:39:18,420
 Kansai area, which is round Oscar and wherever,

884
00:39:18,420 --> 00:39:20,460
 they were found in toilets.

885
00:39:20,460 --> 00:39:21,780
 They were found around toilets.

886
00:39:21,780 --> 00:39:24,500
 So it might be that if you see something

887
00:39:24,500 --> 00:39:26,140
 with pinces on it around the toilets,

888
00:39:26,140 --> 00:39:29,020
 you might call it a penis cutter because it's like there

889
00:39:29,020 --> 00:39:31,020
 might be a folklore that that would happen.

890
00:39:31,020 --> 00:39:32,900
 Yeah, makes sense.

891
00:39:32,900 --> 00:39:35,820
 So we don't think they actually cut penises.

892
00:39:35,820 --> 00:39:38,820
 But it's just that it so happens that in this particular part

893
00:39:38,820 --> 00:39:42,900
 of Japan, they give it a rude name.

894
00:39:42,900 --> 00:39:45,700
 I'm sure you guys have researched earwig penises.

895
00:39:45,700 --> 00:39:46,220
 Oh, yeah.

896
00:39:46,220 --> 00:39:46,700
 All over it.

897
00:39:46,700 --> 00:39:49,700
 Because this is another Japanese connection.

898
00:39:49,700 --> 00:39:52,460
 If you search Japan earwig penis,

899
00:39:52,460 --> 00:39:56,020
 it brings up a study done by Yoshitaka Kamimura

900
00:39:56,020 --> 00:39:58,540
 of the Tokyo Metropolitan University

901
00:39:58,540 --> 00:40:02,140
 who deliberately broke earwig penises off

902
00:40:02,140 --> 00:40:04,380
 while they were mid-sex.

903
00:40:04,380 --> 00:40:05,660
 That's not very nice.

904
00:40:05,660 --> 00:40:07,100
 Just out of my ass.

905
00:40:07,100 --> 00:40:07,940
 Not out of my ass.

906
00:40:07,940 --> 00:40:10,340
 So there is a species.

907
00:40:10,340 --> 00:40:13,140
 Lots of species have two penises.

908
00:40:13,140 --> 00:40:15,340
 The males do anyway.

909
00:40:15,340 --> 00:40:17,900
 And there was a lot of theorizing about whether they were used

910
00:40:17,900 --> 00:40:18,900
 or not.

911
00:40:18,900 --> 00:40:24,540
 And so Yoshitaka Kamimura, he decided to test it

912
00:40:24,540 --> 00:40:25,700
 and his colleagues.

913
00:40:25,700 --> 00:40:27,820
 And they would interrupt mating earwigs

914
00:40:27,820 --> 00:40:29,580
 by pinching the male and lifting him off.

915
00:40:29,580 --> 00:40:31,660
 And because they're very, very, very long penises

916
00:40:31,660 --> 00:40:33,900
 relative to the earwig, they're the same length again.

917
00:40:33,900 --> 00:40:36,900
 They're quite easily broken and they're quite sensitive.

918
00:40:36,900 --> 00:40:39,780
 So the penises all broke off.

919
00:40:39,780 --> 00:40:43,260
 But within two days, they found that these males

920
00:40:43,260 --> 00:40:46,740
 who'd had a penis broken off could inseminate new females

921
00:40:46,740 --> 00:40:48,020
 they were introduced to.

922
00:40:48,020 --> 00:40:52,140
 And they collected 663 of these earwigs from around Japan

923
00:40:52,140 --> 00:40:55,460
 just to test whether they had been undergoing similar problems

924
00:40:55,460 --> 00:40:57,060
 without the scientists interfering

925
00:40:57,060 --> 00:40:58,900
 and snapping their penises off.

926
00:40:58,900 --> 00:41:01,180
 And they found that only a few had had sexual accidents

927
00:41:01,180 --> 00:41:02,540
 like this, but a few had.

928
00:41:02,540 --> 00:41:04,100
 So three males had lost a penis.

929
00:41:04,100 --> 00:41:08,580
 And two females had a severed penis inside them

930
00:41:08,580 --> 00:41:09,940
 from an earlier.

931
00:41:09,940 --> 00:41:12,660
 So that's only one penis unaccounted for from those.

932
00:41:12,660 --> 00:41:13,500
 It's good.

933
00:41:13,500 --> 00:41:16,940
 Keep your eyes peeled.

934
00:41:16,940 --> 00:41:18,340
 The other thing that was the second penis

935
00:41:18,340 --> 00:41:19,580
 is the wrong way around, right?

936
00:41:19,580 --> 00:41:22,380
 So they must have to learn a whole new sexual position

937
00:41:22,380 --> 00:41:24,500
 in that two-day period.

938
00:41:24,500 --> 00:41:26,860
 I assumed it just moved into the position

939
00:41:26,860 --> 00:41:29,220
 vacated by the first one, but you might well be right.

940
00:41:29,220 --> 00:41:30,820
 Oh, OK, I don't know.

941
00:41:30,820 --> 00:41:35,300
 Well, they think they have two because they used to use

942
00:41:35,300 --> 00:41:36,620
 both at the same time.

943
00:41:36,620 --> 00:41:38,660
 Well, some species only have one.

944
00:41:38,660 --> 00:41:41,140
 Some species only have one, but of the ones who have two,

945
00:41:41,140 --> 00:41:45,340
 they think that some females might have had a double vagina.

946
00:41:45,340 --> 00:41:47,740
 I think they've found double vaginaed females, right?

947
00:41:47,740 --> 00:41:51,020
 But they've never witnessed the double penises

948
00:41:51,020 --> 00:41:52,460
 interacting with the double vaginas.

949
00:41:52,460 --> 00:41:55,540
 But it does seem like the obvious thing, doesn't it?

950
00:41:55,540 --> 00:41:59,460
 If you've ever seen a glove and a hand,

951
00:41:59,460 --> 00:42:01,500
 you do automatically see what's going in the other.

952
00:42:01,500 --> 00:42:07,500
 But then you do find men with only one hand,

953
00:42:07,500 --> 00:42:08,980
 and they're women with an extra hand

954
00:42:08,980 --> 00:42:10,500
 found in their glove, don't you?

955
00:42:10,500 --> 00:42:13,340
 [LAUGHTER]

956
00:42:13,340 --> 00:42:19,060
 I was just wondering if maybe the Japanese name penis cutters

957
00:42:19,060 --> 00:42:21,820
 might be because they cut their own penis off sometimes

958
00:42:21,820 --> 00:42:24,980
 when it falls off accidentally.

959
00:42:24,980 --> 00:42:27,700
 So maybe it's not you're worried about your own penis.

960
00:42:27,700 --> 00:42:29,260
 You're kind of worried about the--

961
00:42:29,260 --> 00:42:30,700
 No, I don't think that's true.

962
00:42:30,700 --> 00:42:32,500
 I don't think so.

963
00:42:32,500 --> 00:42:34,660
 I really, really don't like earwigs.

964
00:42:34,660 --> 00:42:37,100
 And I very rarely come across them in my day-to-day life.

965
00:42:37,100 --> 00:42:39,340
 But I remember, as a child, thinking they're really

966
00:42:39,340 --> 00:42:41,020
 scaring, because they can really net view.

967
00:42:41,020 --> 00:42:42,020
 Can they?

968
00:42:42,020 --> 00:42:44,180
 Yeah, when they get their little pincers together,

969
00:42:44,180 --> 00:42:45,220
 they can really be--

970
00:42:45,220 --> 00:42:46,700
 I don't know if I've ever seen one.

971
00:42:46,700 --> 00:42:47,540
 Yeah, I've never seen one.

972
00:42:47,540 --> 00:42:48,460
 Weirdly.

973
00:42:48,460 --> 00:42:49,740
 You've never seen a name?

974
00:42:49,740 --> 00:42:54,500
 They're a bit like any movie from before, 1993.

975
00:42:54,500 --> 00:42:56,380
 But I don't recall ever seen it.

976
00:42:56,380 --> 00:42:58,340
 You get them in the UK, I suppose you must do,

977
00:42:58,340 --> 00:42:59,380
 but I don't remember.

978
00:42:59,380 --> 00:43:00,780
 I cannot believe this is literally

979
00:43:00,780 --> 00:43:02,020
 like you've never seen an ant.

980
00:43:02,020 --> 00:43:03,020
 I've never seen one.

981
00:43:03,020 --> 00:43:04,620
 Well, you just have never looked at the floor.

982
00:43:04,620 --> 00:43:06,180
 I just think maybe I've seen them

983
00:43:06,180 --> 00:43:08,300
 and just thought it was a beetle or something.

984
00:43:08,300 --> 00:43:09,020
 Yeah.

985
00:43:09,020 --> 00:43:11,300
 They look like little scorpions, really, don't they?

986
00:43:11,300 --> 00:43:13,100
 Because of the pincers.

987
00:43:13,100 --> 00:43:15,380
 And the pincers are-- they're very strange,

988
00:43:15,380 --> 00:43:17,300
 because it's quite weird having this defensive device

989
00:43:17,300 --> 00:43:18,620
 on your backside.

990
00:43:18,620 --> 00:43:22,420
 And it has a few purposes, but one is for males

991
00:43:22,420 --> 00:43:26,380
 to spar with each other and to show who's dominant or whatever.

992
00:43:26,380 --> 00:43:28,820
 But I was watching a video of two male earwig sparring

993
00:43:28,820 --> 00:43:30,260
 with their pincers, and it's so awkward,

994
00:43:30,260 --> 00:43:33,500
 because imagine kind of having to spar with someone

995
00:43:33,500 --> 00:43:35,380
 with your butt cheeks.

996
00:43:35,380 --> 00:43:37,980
 So they have to prey around with their necks

997
00:43:37,980 --> 00:43:42,060
 to try and control their pincers, so they're jumping at each other.

998
00:43:42,060 --> 00:43:43,260
 It's just-- it's so--

999
00:43:43,260 --> 00:43:45,260
 That is a royal rumble, I want to see.

1000
00:43:45,260 --> 00:43:47,900
 [LAUGHTER]

1001
00:43:47,900 --> 00:43:49,620
 You're only allowed to use your butt.

1002
00:43:49,620 --> 00:43:50,220
 Yeah.

1003
00:43:50,220 --> 00:43:52,660
 Leave your coat on the bed, and leave your trousers under it.

1004
00:43:52,660 --> 00:43:56,180
 [LAUGHTER]

1005
00:43:56,180 --> 00:44:00,740
 Well, also, it's not a fight to the death.

1006
00:44:00,740 --> 00:44:02,580
 It's just a fight to when someone's like,

1007
00:44:02,580 --> 00:44:03,860
 oh, OK, I've had it off.

1008
00:44:03,860 --> 00:44:06,380
 And they declare a winner, and they go off

1009
00:44:06,380 --> 00:44:09,940
 and they burrow themselves in a sort of shameful hiding,

1010
00:44:09,940 --> 00:44:10,860
 don't they?

1011
00:44:10,860 --> 00:44:11,780
 Yeah, what?

1012
00:44:11,780 --> 00:44:14,220
 Yeah, they get-- it's sort of like once you've lost,

1013
00:44:14,220 --> 00:44:17,460
 they jump away, and then they dig themselves a hole

1014
00:44:17,460 --> 00:44:18,260
 and stay in there.

1015
00:44:18,260 --> 00:44:21,260
 And the victor is sort of like, yeah, I don't know why.

1016
00:44:21,260 --> 00:44:21,900
 Wow.

1017
00:44:21,900 --> 00:44:24,060
 So they can cry in peace, I think.

1018
00:44:24,060 --> 00:44:25,940
 Once Andy had had that scented ball

1019
00:44:25,940 --> 00:44:28,300
 explode all over his face, he spent some time alone

1020
00:44:28,300 --> 00:44:30,020
 in a bathroom cubicle, didn't he?

1021
00:44:30,020 --> 00:44:33,020
 [LAUGHTER]

1022
00:44:33,020 --> 00:44:33,820
 That's amazing.

1023
00:44:33,820 --> 00:44:36,780
 It's amazing that Earwigs have shame and honor codes,

1024
00:44:36,780 --> 00:44:38,060
 like there are any of us.

1025
00:44:38,060 --> 00:44:39,460
 I'm just surprised.

1026
00:44:39,460 --> 00:44:41,180
 And they've got very strong family values.

1027
00:44:41,180 --> 00:44:43,180
 So the sibling stayed together much longer

1028
00:44:43,180 --> 00:44:44,020
 than they need to.

1029
00:44:44,020 --> 00:44:47,300
 Another Earwig raises her young, and she's very attached,

1030
00:44:47,300 --> 00:44:49,660
 and she's very sweet, so she sits on her eggs

1031
00:44:49,660 --> 00:44:51,820
 and then on her nymphs on her baby Earwigs.

1032
00:44:51,820 --> 00:44:53,700
 She'll sit on top of them all to nurture them

1033
00:44:53,700 --> 00:44:56,540
 and lick all the mold and fungi off them.

1034
00:44:56,540 --> 00:44:59,540
 And then the Earwigs are ready to leave the nest

1035
00:44:59,540 --> 00:45:02,020
 very early on, but they all stay together anyway.

1036
00:45:02,020 --> 00:45:03,780
 And they think it might be something to do with the fact

1037
00:45:03,780 --> 00:45:06,020
 that they all eat other's feces.

1038
00:45:06,020 --> 00:45:07,820
 So when time gets up--

1039
00:45:07,820 --> 00:45:09,500
 That was so nice until then.

1040
00:45:09,500 --> 00:45:11,860
 It was reminded me of how during lockdown,

1041
00:45:11,860 --> 00:45:15,380
 I'm seeing a lot of my family on Zoom quizzes and stuff.

1042
00:45:15,380 --> 00:45:17,060
 I'm like, oh, we're a bit like Earwigs,

1043
00:45:17,060 --> 00:45:18,700
 but we don't eat each other's shit.

1044
00:45:18,700 --> 00:45:20,460
 Well, it's one of the main problems with Zoom, isn't it?

1045
00:45:20,460 --> 00:45:22,060
 And then they're trying to overcome this problem

1046
00:45:22,060 --> 00:45:23,820
 with the technology.

1047
00:45:23,820 --> 00:45:25,740
 Because these guys eat each other's poop.

1048
00:45:25,740 --> 00:45:27,900
 And it's only when they don't have much food left.

1049
00:45:27,900 --> 00:45:28,660
 Oh, yeah.

1050
00:45:28,660 --> 00:45:29,660
 It eats food.

1051
00:45:29,660 --> 00:45:31,980
 You wouldn't-- yeah, if you have a pizza in the freezer,

1052
00:45:31,980 --> 00:45:35,620
 you're not going to go straight for that too, right?

1053
00:45:35,620 --> 00:45:38,220
 That's pretty much their attitude.

1054
00:45:38,220 --> 00:45:40,780
 But it does seem to help them stay alive for an extra few days

1055
00:45:40,780 --> 00:45:41,820
 in times of one.

1056
00:45:41,820 --> 00:45:44,140
 The mum, though, you say that she's very caring.

1057
00:45:44,140 --> 00:45:45,700
 And absolutely, that's right.

1058
00:45:45,700 --> 00:45:49,380
 But she does do an interesting survival of the fittest thing,

1059
00:45:49,380 --> 00:45:51,300
 whereby the mothers have the ability

1060
00:45:51,300 --> 00:45:56,100
 to smell out who the healthier of their offspring are.

1061
00:45:56,100 --> 00:45:58,740
 It's a chemical smell that comes off the offspring

1062
00:45:58,740 --> 00:45:59,460
 that they can smell.

1063
00:45:59,460 --> 00:46:00,660
 And so once they've identified--

1064
00:46:00,660 --> 00:46:04,260
 because they have such a big collection of babies,

1065
00:46:04,260 --> 00:46:07,100
 it's something like up to 60, I think I read.

1066
00:46:07,100 --> 00:46:08,940
 30 to 60 at a time.

1067
00:46:08,940 --> 00:46:11,060
 So they need to make sure that the healthy ones

1068
00:46:11,060 --> 00:46:11,980
 are the ones that survive.

1069
00:46:11,980 --> 00:46:13,380
 So they smell them out.

1070
00:46:13,380 --> 00:46:14,660
 And once they know which ones they are,

1071
00:46:14,660 --> 00:46:18,260
 they'll give them more shit to eat just to make them healthier.

1072
00:46:18,260 --> 00:46:22,220
 And they'll pay less attention to the less healthy ones.

1073
00:46:22,220 --> 00:46:23,540
 Yeah.

1074
00:46:23,540 --> 00:46:24,300
 Ouch.

1075
00:46:24,300 --> 00:46:26,020
 So yeah, survival of the fittest.

1076
00:46:26,020 --> 00:46:28,540
 Good mums, but also very, very disciplined.

1077
00:46:28,540 --> 00:46:30,740
 Mm-hmm.

1078
00:46:30,740 --> 00:46:35,340
 This fight was about the names of earwigs and what people call them.

1079
00:46:35,340 --> 00:46:39,500
 In different countries, they have really weird synonyms.

1080
00:46:39,500 --> 00:46:40,820
 I don't know if synonyms are right words.

1081
00:46:40,820 --> 00:46:43,340
 So like the manks word in the Isle of Man,

1082
00:46:43,340 --> 00:46:46,820
 their word for earwig is the same as their word for a dung fork.

1083
00:46:46,820 --> 00:46:47,820
 A dung fork?

1084
00:46:47,820 --> 00:46:48,820
 A dung fork.

1085
00:46:48,820 --> 00:46:50,460
 You know like a pitchfork that you use to pick up dung

1086
00:46:50,460 --> 00:46:51,940
 and then move it from one part of the farm

1087
00:46:51,940 --> 00:46:53,020
 to the other part of the farm?

1088
00:46:53,020 --> 00:46:54,020
 Oh, yeah, yeah.

1089
00:46:54,020 --> 00:46:55,460
 So just a dung fork.

1090
00:46:55,460 --> 00:46:58,500
 Is that what the earwigs use to eat their siblings' feces as well?

1091
00:46:58,500 --> 00:47:04,540
 In Scotch, Gaelic, the word for earwig is the same as the word

1092
00:47:04,540 --> 00:47:07,500
 for having your mouth so full that your cheeks puff out.

1093
00:47:07,500 --> 00:47:08,500
 What?

1094
00:47:08,500 --> 00:47:09,500
 I don't know.

1095
00:47:09,500 --> 00:47:10,500
 I don't know.

1096
00:47:10,500 --> 00:47:11,500
 It's so weird.

1097
00:47:11,500 --> 00:47:14,660
 The Greek word for earwigs is the same as the word for alligator

1098
00:47:14,660 --> 00:47:16,780
 and pruning scissors.

1099
00:47:16,780 --> 00:47:21,180
 The Hungarian word for earwigs is the same for a catchy song.

1100
00:47:21,180 --> 00:47:22,180
 Like an earwag.

1101
00:47:22,180 --> 00:47:23,180
 Oh, an earwag.

1102
00:47:23,180 --> 00:47:24,180
 An earwag.

1103
00:47:24,180 --> 00:47:27,620
 In German, it's an oven, I think, in earwigs as well.

1104
00:47:27,620 --> 00:47:29,180
 So that must be a link between those two.

1105
00:47:29,180 --> 00:47:30,180
 Yeah, okay.

1106
00:47:30,180 --> 00:47:32,700
 It makes me think that it must have been very confusing and greets.

1107
00:47:32,700 --> 00:47:35,540
 If you said to somebody, could you please go and fetch my pruning scissors

1108
00:47:35,540 --> 00:47:37,540
 there in the second drawer down in my bedroom?

1109
00:47:37,540 --> 00:47:39,060
 Come back with an alligator.

1110
00:47:39,060 --> 00:47:40,780
 Are you come back with an alligator, sir?

1111
00:47:40,780 --> 00:47:43,820
 I mean, it's a dangerous game.

1112
00:47:43,820 --> 00:47:47,580
 In Spanish, the word for earwigs is same as for an overhead kick and football.

1113
00:47:47,580 --> 00:47:48,580
 Oh, cool.

1114
00:47:48,580 --> 00:47:49,580
 Wow.

1115
00:47:49,580 --> 00:47:50,580
 So weird.

1116
00:47:50,580 --> 00:47:51,580
 Yeah.

1117
00:47:51,580 --> 00:47:52,580
 Oh, wait.

1118
00:47:52,580 --> 00:47:53,580
 I have a theory about why that one might be.

1119
00:47:53,580 --> 00:47:54,580
 Oh, what?

1120
00:47:54,580 --> 00:47:55,580
 It's a pretty tenuous theory.

1121
00:47:55,580 --> 00:48:01,180
 But when earwigs are mating, they have a really complicated sort of dance they do,

1122
00:48:01,180 --> 00:48:02,180
 getting to know each other.

1123
00:48:02,180 --> 00:48:04,380
 And I think they smell each other.

1124
00:48:04,380 --> 00:48:07,660
 And the male might do a little bit of flexing to show off.

1125
00:48:07,660 --> 00:48:10,380
 And the female nibbles his forceps.

1126
00:48:10,380 --> 00:48:14,620
 And after about ten minutes, she will raise up her abdomen at the back, right?

1127
00:48:14,620 --> 00:48:20,260
 And then the male has to twist his abdomen 180 degrees left to right.

1128
00:48:20,260 --> 00:48:22,060
 So his bum is upside down, basically.

1129
00:48:22,060 --> 00:48:23,620
 And that means that it's facing upwards.

1130
00:48:23,620 --> 00:48:26,580
 And that means that he can couple with her.

1131
00:48:26,580 --> 00:48:28,900
 And then they spend several hours having sex.

1132
00:48:28,900 --> 00:48:35,060
 But that flexibility of the abdomen might be why the bicycle kick has the same name as

1133
00:48:35,060 --> 00:48:36,060
 the earwigs.

1134
00:48:36,060 --> 00:48:37,060
 It could help it.

1135
00:48:37,060 --> 00:48:38,060
 It could help it.

1136
00:48:38,060 --> 00:48:41,860
 So can you tell me why the Ukrainian word for earwigs is the same as their word for

1137
00:48:41,860 --> 00:48:42,860
 pimp?

1138
00:48:42,860 --> 00:48:43,860
 Well.

1139
00:48:43,860 --> 00:48:49,940
 Again, it's to do with turning your bum 180 degrees.

1140
00:48:49,940 --> 00:48:55,660
 Okay, that is it.

1141
00:48:55,660 --> 00:48:56,660
 That is all of our facts.

1142
00:48:56,660 --> 00:48:58,140
