00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.100
 Oh no, they're not gonna wake me up.

00:00:06.100 --> 00:00:10.360
 Oh no, they're not gonna wake me up.

00:00:10.360 --> 00:00:19.500
 Hello and welcome to another episode of No Such Thing as a Fish, a weekly podcast coming

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:23.260
 to you from four undisclosed locations in the UK.

00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:24.260
 My name is Dan Schreiber.

00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:29.140
 I am sitting here with Andrew Hunter Murray, James Harkin, and Anna Tajinsky, and once

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:33.100
 again, we have gathered around the microphones with our four favorite facts from the last

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:37.500
 seven days, and in a particular order, here we go.

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:39.900
 Starting with you, Andy.

00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:44.700
 My fact is that Paris's first public transport system failed because wealthy passengers bought

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:48.940
 all the seats for themselves and then persuaded the government to ban poor people.

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:49.940
 Wow.

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:50.940
 Incredible.

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:56.140
 But if they were selling all the tickets, surely that's not a failure.

00:00:56.140 --> 00:01:00.580
 Well, then the rich apparently does lost interest and then stopped using it, and then no one

00:01:00.580 --> 00:01:01.580
 was using it.

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:03.420
 So it was a complete disaster.

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:07.740
 This is from an article on Lapham's Quarterly, which is an amazing website.

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:08.740
 It's really brilliant.

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:12.700
 It's got so many fascinating things on it, and it's partly based on this brilliant sounding

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:17.660
 book about buses, which is called "Engine of Modernity" by Masha Belenky.

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:21.940
 Andy, have you already moved on from Fennicular Railways then?

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:25.900
 I'm afraid so.

00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:34.060
 So this was called The Carrots, and it was set up by Blaise Pascal.

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:37.740
 So we briefly actually mentioned before that Blaise Pascal set up the first public transport

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:40.980
 system in Paris, but I didn't know what happened to it.

00:01:40.980 --> 00:01:44.420
 And it was basically a carriage with eight passengers and two staff, and they were rude.

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:45.420
 I'm sorry, when was it?

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:46.420
 Did you say?

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:47.420
 Oh, I'm sorry.

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:48.420
 It was in 1662.

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:50.980
 And who was Blaise Pascal again?

00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:57.980
 He was a thinker, mathematician, probability dude, and what's Paris again?

00:01:57.980 --> 00:02:01.900
 I'm sorry, who were you?

00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:06.860
 Anyway, the point is, wealthy riders didn't like sharing with poor people.

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:11.060
 I think they weren't even, I think, really poor people were not even allowed on in the first

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:12.060
 place.

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:15.500
 So I think wealthy people didn't like even sharing with the middle classes.

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:18.860
 And so they would buy up all the seats in the carriage for themselves.

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:21.860
 And it lasted, I think, a few weeks.

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:26.620
 It was this really weird attempt to set up public transport, which didn't work because social

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:27.940
 hierarchy just got in line.

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:31.820
 Oh, I think it lasted a bit longer than that, because they had quite a few different routes

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:32.820
 by the end.

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:33.820
 So they started off.

00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:34.980
 It was Blaise Pascal.

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:40.300
 He put the money in, along with a few other people, including the Duke of Roane.

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:48.060
 And the first route went from Pascal's house to the Duke of Roane's house, just by coincidence.

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:51.380
 And it went through the centre of Paris, but it did pick people up on the way.

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:55.340
 And then they, I think they had three or four other lines, and then they even had a circle

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:57.500
 line that connected all of them.

00:02:57.500 --> 00:03:04.740
 And it was carried on going even after Pascal died, but once he died, it kind of went off.

00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:11.060
 And they banned, the government banned soldiers and pages and other kind of livery to people

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:12.540
 in uniform kind of people.

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:16.740
 And when they banned those, everyone rioted against it, and that's kind of when it all

00:03:16.740 --> 00:03:18.020
 fell out of favour.

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:23.380
 So this is what I did, because I read that, and I didn't quite understand why people wanted

00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:24.980
 men in uniform banned.

00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:27.220
 Well, they were the middle class, basically.

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:32.260
 A men in uniform would be not the working class, but not the, not the post shows.

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:36.100
 They'd be the in between people that you didn't really want to, want to mix with.

00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:37.100
 Right.

00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:39.940
 So they had, they had a fashion ban on the bus, then, right?

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:46.500
 Did they have people, was it the doctor's job, or the bus driver's job to go, "I'm sorry,

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:48.180
 you don't look good enough for my bus."

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:51.580
 Or did you have to provide more concrete evidence, because you can be quite a good looking

00:03:51.580 --> 00:03:52.580
 tailor.

00:03:52.580 --> 00:03:56.580
 Surely you had to provide your CV, or maybe some really references from the former boys

00:03:56.580 --> 00:03:58.540
 or something, and it was to get on the bus.

00:03:58.540 --> 00:04:01.580
 I don't really know how they managed to police it, to be honest.

00:04:01.580 --> 00:04:02.580
 I suppose.

00:04:02.580 --> 00:04:08.280
 I suppose that the other, the other posh people on the bus would go, "That man is a livery

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:09.280
 man."

00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:12.580
 Yeah, livery is pretty easy to spot.

00:04:12.580 --> 00:04:13.580
 Yeah.

00:04:13.580 --> 00:04:16.260
 You could, you know what livery is when you say, "There was actually, I do know one thing

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:20.060
 about how it was police, which is that you could be whipped if you interfered with the operations

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:21.060
 of the bus."

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:22.060
 Wow.

00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:23.060
 Oh.

00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:24.060
 Yeah.

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:25.060
 Quite right, too.

00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:26.060
 I mean, you could still be arrested.

00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:29.420
 I think if you try to interfere with the operations of a public bus today, if you climb onto

00:04:29.420 --> 00:04:32.740
 the driver's lap and take control of the wheel, you are in trouble.

00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:33.740
 That's true.

00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:37.900
 And there probably is still some sort of fashion laws with modern-day London buses.

00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:43.500
 Like, if I went on nude, that might be seen as worthy of not allowing me on.

00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:44.500
 True.

00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:45.500
 Yeah.

00:04:45.500 --> 00:04:48.060
 I just don't know it.

00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:52.420
 And this really did sort of fall by the wayside, the idea of public transport for a long time,

00:04:52.420 --> 00:04:53.420
 didn't it?

00:04:53.420 --> 00:04:56.180
 So obviously you could get coaches and you could, you could hire lots if you could hire a

00:04:56.180 --> 00:05:01.420
 private coach or get on a post-chase or whatever, but the idea that a bus would have a specific

00:05:01.420 --> 00:05:05.380
 route and you knew when it was going to be wet and you could wait there and pick it up.

00:05:05.380 --> 00:05:10.700
 Then didn't come back until 1828, I think, in Europe and in Nantes.

00:05:10.700 --> 00:05:13.660
 That's a long gap between buses, isn't it?

00:05:13.660 --> 00:05:14.660
 Yeah.

00:05:14.660 --> 00:05:21.180
 If you just missed the last one in the 1690s and you're like, OK, I'll wait for the next one.

00:05:21.180 --> 00:05:22.380
 It's there on the schedule.

00:05:22.380 --> 00:05:23.380
 What?

00:05:23.380 --> 00:05:24.380
 Wait?

00:05:24.380 --> 00:05:25.380
 Oh, it's fine.

00:05:25.380 --> 00:05:26.380
 1828.

00:05:26.380 --> 00:05:27.380
 It's only 1747 now.

00:05:27.380 --> 00:05:28.380
 That's fine.

00:05:28.380 --> 00:05:30.380
 No, it's not the clock.

00:05:30.380 --> 00:05:32.820
 1828, too, suddenly came at once.

00:05:32.820 --> 00:05:35.140
 It was the classic.

00:05:35.140 --> 00:05:37.900
 But he didn't even want it to be a public transport system.

00:05:37.900 --> 00:05:38.900
 Really, did he?

00:05:38.900 --> 00:05:43.540
 This was a guy called Stanislas Bordry and he had a bathhouse and he basically just

00:05:43.540 --> 00:05:48.660
 wanted to get people to his bathhouse and so he put on a public bus in order to transport

00:05:48.660 --> 00:05:51.580
 them there and he realised people were getting on it, but they're not getting in the bath

00:05:51.580 --> 00:05:52.580
 at the end.

00:05:52.580 --> 00:05:58.580
 That would be quite useful for your new bus drives, Stan, you have to get changed when

00:05:58.580 --> 00:06:01.900
 you get to the bathhouse.

00:06:01.900 --> 00:06:06.060
 It would be amazing if you could get a bus which was going to the swimming pool and

00:06:06.060 --> 00:06:09.260
 the bus just ended up in the swimming pool and you could just swim out.

00:06:09.260 --> 00:06:10.260
 Oh, like a piece.

00:06:10.260 --> 00:06:11.260
 You know what I mean?

00:06:11.260 --> 00:06:17.380
 It just goes in and then the bus goes out of the ramp or the swimmers who finish get off.

00:06:17.380 --> 00:06:21.660
 Like in the Italian job, is it where there's a bus kind of gets to the edge of the cliff

00:06:21.660 --> 00:06:25.660
 at the end and you could kind of jump off the bus and dive into the water?

00:06:25.660 --> 00:06:26.660
 That's quite cool.

00:06:26.660 --> 00:06:27.660
 Yeah.

00:06:27.660 --> 00:06:30.060
 You need to have people, have you seen that movie James?

00:06:30.060 --> 00:06:33.780
 Have I fuck?

00:06:33.780 --> 00:06:41.180
 You should write a book about films because you are knowledgeable, but you've seen

00:06:41.180 --> 00:06:42.180
 none of them.

00:06:42.180 --> 00:06:43.180
 It's great.

00:06:43.180 --> 00:06:48.740
 The 19th century buses, when they came back, they were the first ones that had an upper deck,

00:06:48.740 --> 00:06:49.740
 which was really cool.

00:06:49.740 --> 00:06:54.620
 So the upper deck, you could go there for half price, but only if you were a man, they wouldn't

00:06:54.620 --> 00:07:00.340
 let women go up there and the reason was because it was deemed unbecoming for a woman

00:07:00.340 --> 00:07:03.820
 to go up there in the big skirts that they were wearing and even actually impossible because

00:07:03.820 --> 00:07:08.780
 it was like a ladder to get to the top deck and also because it was completely in the open.

00:07:08.780 --> 00:07:12.660
 So most of the time you just get drenched by rain or wind or whatever, so it was deemed

00:07:12.660 --> 00:07:14.660
 unbecoming for women to get drenched.

00:07:14.660 --> 00:07:17.820
 Is that because if someone's following you up the stairs, they see up your dress to your

00:07:17.820 --> 00:07:18.820
 panties?

00:07:18.820 --> 00:07:23.500
 Well, that might have been some of that in there because actually when they brought the

00:07:23.500 --> 00:07:29.980
 public transport into France the second time, it kind of became a thing where it was giving

00:07:29.980 --> 00:07:36.580
 women more chance to move around and it was associated with like transgression in women.

00:07:36.580 --> 00:07:40.940
 Like a lot of whenever any kind of freedom got given to women in history, like people thought,

00:07:40.940 --> 00:07:42.900
 "Oh, this must be a terrible thing."

00:07:42.900 --> 00:07:47.700
 Yeah, but as James is saying as well, there's a suggestion, which I think is a very, it's

00:07:47.700 --> 00:07:52.820
 a more jokey suggestion that the skirts, the frames of those giant hoop skirts would be

00:07:52.820 --> 00:07:55.540
 so large they physically couldn't fit them.

00:07:55.540 --> 00:08:00.300
 They would get stuck on the way up, but yeah, but as a result, it became quite a social

00:08:00.300 --> 00:08:05.740
 place, the bus and there was sort of known bus perverts who would sort of just hang out

00:08:05.740 --> 00:08:07.860
 just so that they could be around all these women.

00:08:07.860 --> 00:08:12.740
 I'm so worried, Dan, that you've alighted immediately that it became quite a social place

00:08:12.740 --> 00:08:14.860
 and there were these bus perverts.

00:08:14.860 --> 00:08:19.180
 So that's the definition of a social place is if you've got a good pervert there, holding

00:08:19.180 --> 00:08:20.180
 court.

00:08:20.180 --> 00:08:29.780
 I mean, it led to bus pervertism where you would have guys would just spend the whole day

00:08:29.780 --> 00:08:35.540
 on the bus and if another lady came on, they would sit next to her or be squashed up next

00:08:35.540 --> 00:08:42.300
 to someone, it was the perfect way for the pervert to suddenly have access to a bunch of women,

00:08:42.300 --> 00:08:43.300
 which was a big problem.

00:08:43.300 --> 00:08:47.620
 Not saying it is a good thing, guys, but the bad buses are quite sociable.

00:08:47.620 --> 00:08:48.620
 Now aren't they?

00:08:48.620 --> 00:08:49.780
 The Venger bus, for instance.

00:08:49.780 --> 00:08:50.780
 Yeah.

00:08:50.780 --> 00:08:53.380
 The bus, the bus is Spice World the movie.

00:08:53.380 --> 00:08:54.380
 They all had a pervert.

00:08:54.380 --> 00:08:59.180
 The acquaintance with buses is from film, even though you don't watch film.

00:08:59.180 --> 00:09:02.940
 I just think it is a social thing, the bus, isn't it?

00:09:02.940 --> 00:09:03.940
 True.

00:09:03.940 --> 00:09:05.300
 Have you seen Spice World the movie?

00:09:05.300 --> 00:09:07.380
 No, I obviously haven't seen Spice World the movie.

00:09:07.380 --> 00:09:10.540
 I haven't either, but it's got Richard E. Grant, isn't it?

00:09:10.540 --> 00:09:11.540
 He's the bus driver.

00:09:11.540 --> 00:09:12.540
 He's the manager.

00:09:12.540 --> 00:09:13.540
 Yeah.

00:09:13.540 --> 00:09:15.340
 Oh, yeah, but does he also drive the bus?

00:09:15.340 --> 00:09:17.220
 I think at what point he does drive the bus, yeah.

00:09:17.220 --> 00:09:18.220
 Okay.

00:09:18.220 --> 00:09:23.180
 So does Victoria Beckham, but I don't call her the bus driver in the movie.

00:09:23.180 --> 00:09:25.820
 Summer holiday with Cliff Richard, that I had a bus in it.

00:09:25.820 --> 00:09:26.820
 Yep.

00:09:26.820 --> 00:09:27.820
 Yeah.

00:09:27.820 --> 00:09:30.820
 I think the Spice World won a Stanley clear coach by the definitions we're running by.

00:09:30.820 --> 00:09:32.140
 It's not like anyone could board.

00:09:32.140 --> 00:09:36.620
 It's not that Spice Girls paid their 180 fat, got on, and there's lots of other people

00:09:36.620 --> 00:09:37.620
 got on and off.

00:09:37.620 --> 00:09:41.460
 Didn't the Spice Girls buy out all the seats in that bus, so no one else could get on it?

00:09:41.460 --> 00:09:42.460
 Yeah.

00:09:42.460 --> 00:09:43.460
 That's right.

00:09:43.460 --> 00:09:46.260
 Imagine how long it would take to tour the country if all the buses taking the

00:09:46.260 --> 00:09:50.460
 bans around with public buses.

00:09:50.460 --> 00:09:55.380
 We got three hours to get there, but we've got 40 stops along the way.

00:09:55.380 --> 00:09:58.540
 Can I tell you guys a personal, something personal?

00:09:58.540 --> 00:09:59.540
 Yeah.

00:09:59.540 --> 00:10:00.540
 Oh, boy.

00:10:00.540 --> 00:10:05.100
 I was recently reading an old copy of the Pickwick Papers that I found.

00:10:05.100 --> 00:10:06.620
 I think my parents asked ages ago.

00:10:06.620 --> 00:10:09.220
 Well, no, I think I inherited it from my grandma.

00:10:09.220 --> 00:10:15.100
 Anyway, I opened it to one page, and there was a bus ticket in there, or a tram ticket, sorry.

00:10:15.100 --> 00:10:16.980
 It's just a scrap of tram ticket.

00:10:16.980 --> 00:10:22.940
 It's from London United tramways, so I looked that up, and that ran from 1894 to 1933.

00:10:22.940 --> 00:10:27.500
 And it's punched for a journey in the sort of Wimbledon Kingston area.

00:10:27.500 --> 00:10:28.700
 And it says it costs two pennies.

00:10:28.700 --> 00:10:30.220
 It was 2D.

00:10:30.220 --> 00:10:31.220
 And isn't that cool?

00:10:31.220 --> 00:10:32.500
 And I don't know who owned it.

00:10:32.500 --> 00:10:37.060
 And I looked at that one, like, looking up the, when the ticket was from, when those stops

00:10:37.060 --> 00:10:39.580
 existed, and also the advert on the other side.

00:10:39.580 --> 00:10:44.140
 So on the other side, there's an advert for Holloway's magic ointment, or Holloway's

00:10:44.140 --> 00:10:45.140
 all-rounder ointment.

00:10:45.140 --> 00:10:46.140
 Okay.

00:10:46.140 --> 00:10:47.980
 I think it's from 1900.

00:10:47.980 --> 00:10:48.980
 Wow.

00:10:48.980 --> 00:10:49.980
 What does this ointment do?

00:10:49.980 --> 00:10:51.580
 That's what I'm getting from the story.

00:10:51.580 --> 00:10:53.420
 It cures absolutely everything, James.

00:10:53.420 --> 00:10:54.420
 It's an all-round remedy.

00:10:54.420 --> 00:11:00.740
 It's literally said, backache, heart attacks, brain disease, vomiting.

00:11:00.740 --> 00:11:01.740
 It's all there.

00:11:01.740 --> 00:11:04.860
 Actually, then I went on a stupid rabbit hole that was made by a guy called Thomas Holloway,

00:11:04.860 --> 00:11:06.780
 and it made him super rich.

00:11:06.780 --> 00:11:13.820
 And so he bought this mansion called Tittonhurst Park, and that, Dan, you do recognise it.

00:11:13.820 --> 00:11:15.420
 Why do you recognise it?

00:11:15.420 --> 00:11:16.420
 The Beatles?

00:11:16.420 --> 00:11:17.420
 Yeah.

00:11:17.420 --> 00:11:19.460
 Apparently John Lennon lived there a hundred years after him.

00:11:19.460 --> 00:11:20.460
 Yeah, wow.

00:11:20.460 --> 00:11:26.060
 So that was a convoluted way that I got to John Lennon via this fact.

00:11:26.060 --> 00:11:27.060
 But anyway, isn't that cool?

00:11:27.060 --> 00:11:29.740
 I've got a bus ticket from 120 years ago.

00:11:29.740 --> 00:11:30.740
 That is very cool.

00:11:30.740 --> 00:11:31.740
 I think so.

00:11:31.740 --> 00:11:34.140
 Do you know, can I give a quick personal story?

00:11:34.140 --> 00:11:40.900
 When I went to Zanzibar on Honeymoon, suddenly coming up next, did you find a bus ticket

00:11:40.900 --> 00:11:45.900
 that used to belong to Freddie Mercury or something?

00:11:45.900 --> 00:11:52.620
 No, next to me is Anna's grandmother driving a bus, I just couldn't believe it.

00:11:52.620 --> 00:11:57.740
 Next to me is a bus that I used to get, not obviously the exact bus, but a bus that I

00:11:57.740 --> 00:12:00.340
 used to get in Hong Kong as a kid.

00:12:00.340 --> 00:12:04.700
 And I suddenly looked around and all the buses in Zanzibar were the old buses from Hong

00:12:04.700 --> 00:12:06.100
 Kong, from my childhood.

00:12:06.100 --> 00:12:07.100
 Wow.

00:12:07.100 --> 00:12:11.420
 And I think when buses are put out of, you know, when new buses come in to say London

00:12:11.420 --> 00:12:14.700
 or whatever, they shift out all these buses to all these different countries.

00:12:14.700 --> 00:12:15.700
 Yeah.

00:12:15.700 --> 00:12:16.700
 And Zanzibar.

00:12:16.700 --> 00:12:17.700
 That is awesome.

00:12:17.700 --> 00:12:19.300
 All the old London buses went to Macau, I think.

00:12:19.300 --> 00:12:22.700
 So if you, they might not be there anymore, about 10 years ago, if you went on a bus in

00:12:22.700 --> 00:12:24.860
 Macau, they were old London buses.

00:12:24.860 --> 00:12:25.860
 Wow.

00:12:25.860 --> 00:12:30.100
 And the Bendy buses, I think we've said before, they went somewhere super inappropriate.

00:12:30.100 --> 00:12:31.100
 Yeah.

00:12:31.100 --> 00:12:37.860
 I don't mean like they went to a sex club, but I mean they went to a place where they were

00:12:37.860 --> 00:12:46.420
 at the bus.

00:12:46.420 --> 00:12:52.420
 Can I quickly tell you the most desperate ever press release I found about buses?

00:12:52.420 --> 00:12:53.420
 Okay.

00:12:53.420 --> 00:12:57.260
 This was at the time the James Bond film Spectre was coming out.

00:12:57.260 --> 00:13:00.400
 The press releases by National Express, the bus company.

00:13:00.400 --> 00:13:04.860
 So often sophisticated James Bond is unquestionably one of the most glamorous characters of all time,

00:13:04.860 --> 00:13:09.100
 but was the world's most famous by named after a humble bus?

00:13:09.100 --> 00:13:12.460
 It's a question National Express hopes to answer once and for all.

00:13:12.460 --> 00:13:15.580
 We know where he got his name James Bond.

00:13:15.580 --> 00:13:16.580
 I know.

00:13:16.580 --> 00:13:17.580
 I know.

00:13:17.580 --> 00:13:19.100
 But the 007 bit, I mean.

00:13:19.100 --> 00:13:20.100
 Oh, right.

00:13:20.100 --> 00:13:21.100
 Okay.

00:13:21.100 --> 00:13:22.100
 Sorry, yeah.

00:13:22.100 --> 00:13:25.260
 The National Express 007 coach service, which was formerly a bus route when it was taken

00:13:25.260 --> 00:13:29.420
 over in 1973, operates nine times daily between Deal and Victoria.

00:13:29.420 --> 00:13:34.620
 It has rumored Bond author Fleming was inspired by the destination blind of his local bus to adopt

00:13:34.620 --> 00:13:38.860
 the number and they go on and on and on about it.

00:13:38.860 --> 00:13:42.540
 And they even got a National Express driver to say, well, James Bond is more likely to be

00:13:42.540 --> 00:13:44.180
 seen behind the wheel of a Bentley.

00:13:44.180 --> 00:13:48.860
 It's a massive honor to drive the 007 and it certainly attracts a lot of attention.

00:13:48.860 --> 00:13:50.300
 It's always a talking point.

00:13:50.300 --> 00:13:55.260
 You see heads turning by as you go by and people pointing, they're definitely more passengers

00:13:55.260 --> 00:13:57.460
 recently, perhaps because of the new film.

00:13:57.460 --> 00:13:59.380
 I would have thought that's definitely the case.

00:13:59.380 --> 00:14:12.660
 It turns out that the National Numbering Scheme wasn't actually introduced until the mid-1970s.

00:14:12.660 --> 00:14:13.660
 Okay.

00:14:13.660 --> 00:14:16.780
 It is time for fact number two and that is Anna.

00:14:16.780 --> 00:14:21.060
 My fact this week is that Aladdin is Chinese.

00:14:21.060 --> 00:14:22.060
 What?

00:14:22.060 --> 00:14:35.900
 Are you doing your own life for the fact now, Anna?

00:14:35.900 --> 00:14:36.900
 Thank you.

00:14:36.900 --> 00:14:37.900
 I know.

00:14:37.900 --> 00:14:38.900
 Right.

00:14:38.900 --> 00:14:43.700
 So I decided I wanted to read Aladdin, so I read about this new translation.

00:14:43.700 --> 00:14:48.500
 So I bought it recently, opened it and the very first line of the story.

00:14:48.500 --> 00:14:50.500
 No bus tickets in there.

00:14:50.500 --> 00:14:53.340
 One way to get on a budget carpet.

00:14:53.340 --> 00:14:57.740
 It's a bus ticket from Shanghai, which is how I knew.

00:14:57.740 --> 00:15:01.380
 The first line is in one of China's vast and wealthy kingdoms.

00:15:01.380 --> 00:15:03.940
 I thought this is a shit translation.

00:15:03.940 --> 00:15:07.180
 They've got the bloody country wrong, first sentence.

00:15:07.180 --> 00:15:10.780
 But turns out it's bang on and he was from China.

00:15:10.780 --> 00:15:16.020
 And so the whole story behind Aladdin and the 2001 Arabian Knights, which is what it's

00:15:16.020 --> 00:15:22.140
 a part of, is kind of an amazing story of tales being passed from one country to the next.

00:15:22.140 --> 00:15:28.300
 So basically it was written down for the first time by a French guy called Antoine Galon.

00:15:28.300 --> 00:15:31.060
 And this is in the very early 1700s.

00:15:31.060 --> 00:15:35.260
 And he'd been told it by a Syrian who he'd met, a guy from Aleppo.

00:15:35.260 --> 00:15:37.620
 And the Syrian had told it as him being a Chinese person.

00:15:37.620 --> 00:15:41.660
 So it was told in Arabia, but Aladdin was Chinese.

00:15:41.660 --> 00:15:45.540
 And it was just this thing where whenever something is kind of exotic or foreign, we go

00:15:45.540 --> 00:15:46.540
 east.

00:15:46.540 --> 00:15:49.180
 We seem to just go east when we're telling a story as an exotic or foreign.

00:15:49.180 --> 00:15:53.660
 So if you were in Persia, then you wanted to convey that something was like exotic or

00:15:53.660 --> 00:15:56.740
 a bit strange, you put it in China, set it in China.

00:15:56.740 --> 00:16:03.420
 And I don't know what you do in Chinese, set it in Japan, yeah, Japan, Alaska.

00:16:03.420 --> 00:16:04.580
 Is his name Aladdin then?

00:16:04.580 --> 00:16:06.620
 Because that's not a very Chinese name.

00:16:06.620 --> 00:16:08.460
 No, this is the weird thing about it.

00:16:08.460 --> 00:16:11.220
 The details are quite Arabic.

00:16:11.220 --> 00:16:16.140
 So they didn't read no much about actual China, but they were just setting it in China.

00:16:16.140 --> 00:16:19.180
 So throughout the story, you'll read, you know, he was in one of these classic Chinese

00:16:19.180 --> 00:16:20.180
 palaces.

00:16:20.180 --> 00:16:23.900
 And then they'll describe the palace and it'll be a combination of an Arabian palace with

00:16:23.900 --> 00:16:26.940
 some French influence because it was written down by a French guy.

00:16:26.940 --> 00:16:29.900
 Was there a theory that Galon had invented it himself as well?

00:16:29.900 --> 00:16:34.500
 Because it took a long time to track down the Syrian who, it's a monk who had told him

00:16:34.500 --> 00:16:35.500
 the story.

00:16:35.500 --> 00:16:37.500
 Yeah, this is also amazing.

00:16:37.500 --> 00:16:38.500
 Yeah.

00:16:38.500 --> 00:16:42.660
 I love that this was, this mystery was solved sort of hundreds of years later.

00:16:42.660 --> 00:16:48.100
 So yeah, Galon said that he'd, he wrote down a thousand and one nights, the Arabic stories.

00:16:48.100 --> 00:16:50.500
 And then people were clamoring for more.

00:16:50.500 --> 00:16:54.020
 And so he wrote down some more stories that weren't in the original Arabic version he

00:16:54.020 --> 00:16:55.020
 was translating.

00:16:55.020 --> 00:16:57.900
 And he said that he'd been told them by this Syrian guy.

00:16:57.900 --> 00:17:02.580
 But everyone sort of assumed he'd just made them up and then given them this origin story

00:17:02.580 --> 00:17:03.740
 from Syria.

00:17:03.740 --> 00:17:08.780
 And then they found the autobiography of the Syrian guy who's called Hannah Diab.

00:17:08.780 --> 00:17:12.860
 They found the autobiography in 1993, isn't it, which I just, it's how incredible is that

00:17:12.860 --> 00:17:15.460
 sort of 280 years later?

00:17:15.460 --> 00:17:19.380
 Does he say it is autobiography, met a French guy today and told him this brilliant story

00:17:19.380 --> 00:17:20.700
 about a Chinese guy in the lab?

00:17:20.700 --> 00:17:22.700
 He does, he mentions it.

00:17:22.700 --> 00:17:25.420
 He does, he mentions it in his memoirs.

00:17:25.420 --> 00:17:30.180
 And there is a theory now, a new theory which is that the story of Aladdin might be an

00:17:30.180 --> 00:17:32.820
 autobiography of this guy called Diab.

00:17:32.820 --> 00:17:37.380
 And he's talking about when he arrived in Paris because he arrived in Versailles and they

00:17:37.380 --> 00:17:39.460
 had all these wonderful things.

00:17:39.460 --> 00:17:43.580
 And Aladdin is obviously the story of a young boy who kind of gets lots of riches and

00:17:43.580 --> 00:17:44.580
 stuff.

00:17:44.580 --> 00:17:49.580
 And so it might have been him kind of turning his experiences into an Arabic story.

00:17:49.580 --> 00:17:50.580
 Wow.

00:17:50.580 --> 00:17:52.860
 Well, definitely influenced by his time in France anyway.

00:17:52.860 --> 00:17:56.940
 Because yeah, when Aladdin magics is palessed out of nothing, it's very much Versailles

00:17:56.940 --> 00:17:57.940
 influenced.

00:17:57.940 --> 00:18:02.220
 It's pretty amazing that this was a very famous text for its time, right?

00:18:02.220 --> 00:18:03.740
 The Arabian Nights.

00:18:03.740 --> 00:18:05.860
 And then this guy comes along.

00:18:05.860 --> 00:18:11.180
 He adds not only probably the most famous story, which is Aladdin, but he also adds the story

00:18:11.180 --> 00:18:13.580
 of Ali Barba and the 40 Thieves.

00:18:13.580 --> 00:18:19.060
 He adds the seven voyages of Simbad, the sailor, the three most famous stories probably had

00:18:19.060 --> 00:18:20.740
 nothing to do with the original.

00:18:20.740 --> 00:18:21.740
 It's fanfiction.

00:18:21.740 --> 00:18:22.740
 Yeah.

00:18:22.740 --> 00:18:26.540
 He added to a book which has suddenly overtaken the book.

00:18:26.540 --> 00:18:29.340
 Yeah, he was, it wasn't that famous when he was translating it, was it?

00:18:29.340 --> 00:18:30.340
 I don't think.

00:18:30.340 --> 00:18:33.020
 And he was kind of the one who made it famous.

00:18:33.020 --> 00:18:37.580
 And the problem was like Europe, yeah, yeah, sorry, in Europe for sure.

00:18:37.580 --> 00:18:40.220
 But like I kind of said, people wanted more.

00:18:40.220 --> 00:18:43.580
 And so his publishers just started going, oh, we'll just write some more, then put them

00:18:43.580 --> 00:18:44.900
 in your name.

00:18:44.900 --> 00:18:49.420
 So they started taking other stories from Turkey and from other parts of Eastern Europe

00:18:49.420 --> 00:18:53.220
 and then putting them in as part of the 1,001 Nights.

00:18:53.220 --> 00:18:56.060
 And he's like, no, no, wait, no, don't put those shit ones in.

00:18:56.060 --> 00:18:57.060
 I'll give you some more.

00:18:57.060 --> 00:18:58.060
 I'll give you some more.

00:18:58.060 --> 00:19:00.860
 Like these new ones like Symbad and Aladdin came from.

00:19:00.860 --> 00:19:02.660
 That's a good way to threaten an author.

00:19:02.660 --> 00:19:05.020
 To threaten to write the sequel really badly.

00:19:05.020 --> 00:19:06.020
 That's true.

00:19:06.020 --> 00:19:08.260
 They should do that with George R.R. Martin, shouldn't they?

00:19:08.260 --> 00:19:11.900
 They should say, we're just going to write the last Game of Thrones.

00:19:11.900 --> 00:19:14.700
 We're just going to get E.L. James to write it.

00:19:14.700 --> 00:19:17.860
 He's like, no, no, no.

00:19:17.860 --> 00:19:21.900
 He also had his windows in Paris pelted with kind of rotten fruit and hard objects

00:19:21.900 --> 00:19:23.740
 by people who wanted more stories.

00:19:23.740 --> 00:19:27.140
 The reading public was much more demanding in those days.

00:19:27.140 --> 00:19:30.380
 Imagine if I'd done that to Hillary Mantell for the last five years,

00:19:30.380 --> 00:19:34.060
 just kind of attacking her with various missiles.

00:19:34.060 --> 00:19:37.340
 And it wouldn't induce you to want to satisfy your public by writing something.

00:19:37.340 --> 00:19:38.180
 But it did.

00:19:38.180 --> 00:19:38.940
 And he did.

00:19:38.940 --> 00:19:42.140
 But the story that we all know, I would say,

00:19:42.140 --> 00:19:47.340
 is as a result of the brilliant animated 1992 movie.

00:19:47.340 --> 00:19:49.300
 I think we've all seen that, have we?

00:19:49.300 --> 00:19:50.180
 Have we all seen that?

00:19:50.180 --> 00:19:51.140
 Yeah, of course, yeah.

00:19:51.140 --> 00:19:51.900
 We've all seen that.

00:19:51.900 --> 00:19:55.620
 So I'm going to take very quiet over there.

00:19:55.620 --> 00:20:01.660
 But yeah, so classic Hollywood distorted the facts of the story,

00:20:01.660 --> 00:20:03.420
 bent them to be a different story altogether.

00:20:03.420 --> 00:20:07.180
 So in it, Aladdin's not a Norfolk in the original story,

00:20:07.180 --> 00:20:08.500
 which he's portrayed as in the movie.

00:20:08.500 --> 00:20:09.820
 He lives with his mum.

00:20:09.820 --> 00:20:13.580
 And in the original story, it's not just one genie granting wishes.

00:20:13.580 --> 00:20:15.260
 It's two genies.

00:20:15.260 --> 00:20:18.220
 There's a genie of the lamp and there's a genie of the ring.

00:20:18.220 --> 00:20:20.140
 And then it's not three wishes.

00:20:20.140 --> 00:20:21.700
 Like, he gets as many wishes.

00:20:21.700 --> 00:20:23.020
 He just keeps wishing away.

00:20:23.020 --> 00:20:24.220
 Is this having a wishing party?

00:20:24.220 --> 00:20:26.940
 Did he do that trick that everyone says they're going to do

00:20:26.940 --> 00:20:29.660
 when they're a kid where the first wish is infinite wishes?

00:20:29.660 --> 00:20:30.460
 Is that how he does it?

00:20:30.460 --> 00:20:32.500
 Oh, yeah.

00:20:32.500 --> 00:20:33.220
 It's not allowed.

00:20:33.220 --> 00:20:35.300
 The genie specifically bands that are in the Disney film,

00:20:35.300 --> 00:20:38.060
 which you wouldn't know if you had watched it, James.

00:20:38.060 --> 00:20:40.260
 I really thought that was the rest of it.

00:20:40.260 --> 00:20:41.900
 That's so good that it's infinite, though.

00:20:41.900 --> 00:20:43.220
 I always thought it was a million.

00:20:43.220 --> 00:20:45.660
 How stupid would I have looked with you guys

00:20:45.660 --> 00:20:46.900
 as I got to my millionth wish?

00:20:46.900 --> 00:20:49.060
 You guys get to carry that one.

00:20:49.060 --> 00:20:50.660
 You could just use your millionth wish

00:20:50.660 --> 00:20:52.660
 to ask for another million wishes.

00:20:52.660 --> 00:20:56.380
 I'm like, Jesus, what are you saying?

00:20:56.380 --> 00:20:58.620
 Although you could have asked for a thousand and one

00:20:58.620 --> 00:21:01.180
 in Arabic because the reason it's a thousand and one

00:21:01.180 --> 00:21:03.100
 nights is actually because that was like an Arabic word

00:21:03.100 --> 00:21:05.580
 for infinite, infinite stories.

00:21:05.580 --> 00:21:06.620
 It was meant to be.

00:21:06.620 --> 00:21:09.940
 Yeah, because if they called it 270 nights, roughly,

00:21:09.940 --> 00:21:12.020
 it's not as impressive or sexy, is it?

00:21:12.020 --> 00:21:13.100
 It's not.

00:21:13.100 --> 00:21:15.860
 But also, no wonder the publishers wanted more stories.

00:21:15.860 --> 00:21:19.620
 This is nowhere near the number you've promised.

00:21:19.620 --> 00:21:21.420
 Hey, the most striking thing about the story,

00:21:21.420 --> 00:21:23.900
 which, as I say, I have just read, and it is great,

00:21:23.900 --> 00:21:24.740
 is Aladdin.

00:21:24.740 --> 00:21:29.380
 It's a complete dickhead, like not a likable character at all.

00:21:29.380 --> 00:21:31.100
 So the reason his dad dies at the start

00:21:31.100 --> 00:21:34.060
 is because Aladdin is so lazy and greasy and dissipated

00:21:34.060 --> 00:21:36.500
 and cruel that his dad's just devastated

00:21:36.500 --> 00:21:39.180
 that he won't follow him in his career path.

00:21:39.180 --> 00:21:41.980
 And basically, he just gets really lucky.

00:21:41.980 --> 00:21:43.780
 He gets sort of kidnapped by this bloke

00:21:43.780 --> 00:21:45.980
 who reveals all these riches to him.

00:21:45.980 --> 00:21:49.060
 And then he manages to escape the bloke, the wizard.

00:21:49.060 --> 00:21:52.340
 And then just uses all the riches to seduce the princess.

00:21:52.340 --> 00:21:54.140
 He falls in love with the princess

00:21:54.140 --> 00:21:57.580
 because he hears that she's going to be going to the bath.

00:21:57.580 --> 00:22:00.260
 I don't know what number bath she wants to be.

00:22:00.260 --> 00:22:01.420
 At the time.

00:22:01.420 --> 00:22:03.300
 But he hears she's going to be going to the baths.

00:22:03.300 --> 00:22:05.620
 And so he sneaks in to spy on her

00:22:05.620 --> 00:22:08.060
 because he's never seen a woman unveiled before.

00:22:08.060 --> 00:22:11.900
 She's her face from behind the door, really fancies her.

00:22:11.900 --> 00:22:15.180
 And she's going to marry this guy who seems like a really decent bloke,

00:22:15.180 --> 00:22:19.340
 the viseous son. And Aladdin, just on their wedding night,

00:22:19.340 --> 00:22:21.540
 on the viseous and her wedding night,

00:22:21.540 --> 00:22:25.940
 uses the lamp to magic their marriage bed into his own home.

00:22:25.940 --> 00:22:27.460
 And then he gets the viseous son out.

00:22:27.460 --> 00:22:28.940
 He sends him out to spend the whole night

00:22:28.940 --> 00:22:31.100
 in a freezing cold toilet outside

00:22:31.100 --> 00:22:32.500
 and then lies with the princess.

00:22:32.500 --> 00:22:33.700
 Wow, that's how he seduced him.

00:22:33.700 --> 00:22:35.180
 So that's why he's called Aladdin, isn't it?

00:22:35.180 --> 00:22:37.460
 Because he's an absolute lad.

00:22:37.460 --> 00:22:40.660
 That's the full name is an absolute lad in, yeah.

00:22:40.660 --> 00:22:42.860
 An absolute lad gets in there.

00:22:42.860 --> 00:22:45.060
 Yeah.

00:22:45.060 --> 00:22:48.340
 So, Anna, you haven't been reading the Richard Burton one, right?

00:22:48.340 --> 00:22:51.140
 No, this is a new translation, which I would recommend

00:22:51.140 --> 00:22:54.140
 because it's by this woman called Yasmin Seal, who is French Syrian,

00:22:54.140 --> 00:22:56.580
 which I just love because obviously it was an amalgamation

00:22:56.580 --> 00:22:59.980
 of French and Syrian when it was first written.

00:22:59.980 --> 00:23:01.500
 But no, not that one.

00:23:01.500 --> 00:23:02.020
 Why?

00:23:02.020 --> 00:23:04.300
 Because Richard Burton was the, Richard Burton

00:23:04.300 --> 00:23:06.700
 the Victorian explorer and linguist.

00:23:06.700 --> 00:23:08.260
 He did all these amazing adventures.

00:23:08.260 --> 00:23:10.780
 He visited Mecca in disguise once.

00:23:10.780 --> 00:23:12.500
 And he would have been killed if he'd been discovered.

00:23:12.500 --> 00:23:13.860
 You know, he was an amazing adventurer.

00:23:13.860 --> 00:23:19.980
 But Burton wrote a really erotic translation of "The Thousand of One Nights"

00:23:19.980 --> 00:23:21.940
 because he also translated the calmasutra

00:23:21.940 --> 00:23:26.220
 and he was very sexy.

00:23:26.220 --> 00:23:30.500
 Visor the bus pervert of his day, he was.

00:23:30.500 --> 00:23:31.980
 But in his version of Aladdin,

00:23:31.980 --> 00:23:33.340
 Aladdin's father is impotent.

00:23:33.340 --> 00:23:37.140
 And so he takes an opium-based medicine to thicken his semen.

00:23:37.140 --> 00:23:38.140
 Jesus.

00:23:38.140 --> 00:23:40.660
 That's just a detail of the story.

00:23:40.660 --> 00:23:41.340
 Cool.

00:23:41.340 --> 00:23:44.500
 I think that's the Holloway's ointment of its day, isn't it?

00:23:44.500 --> 00:23:46.980
 [LAUGHTER]

00:23:46.980 --> 00:23:49.700
 Yeah, his version had to be privately printed, didn't it?

00:23:49.700 --> 00:23:50.420
 It was--

00:23:50.420 --> 00:23:51.180
 Yeah, I think it did.

00:23:51.180 --> 00:23:52.380
 --because of the sexual content.

00:23:52.380 --> 00:23:54.660
 Yeah, you had to-- you couldn't buy it.

00:23:54.660 --> 00:23:56.580
 It was through subscription that you had to get it.

00:23:56.580 --> 00:23:56.980
 Wow.

00:23:56.980 --> 00:23:57.740
 Yeah.

00:23:57.740 --> 00:23:59.260
 And I haven't seen the Disney film for a while,

00:23:59.260 --> 00:24:01.740
 but I'm pretty sure they didn't leave that element, did they?

00:24:01.740 --> 00:24:02.980
 It's strongly implied.

00:24:02.980 --> 00:24:06.780
 [LAUGHTER]

00:24:06.780 --> 00:24:09.460
 Yeah, he was a pretty crazy character at Richard Burton.

00:24:09.460 --> 00:24:11.260
 I'm never sure how I feel about him.

00:24:11.260 --> 00:24:13.820
 But he did like to sex things up.

00:24:13.820 --> 00:24:16.220
 I suppose he didn't need to sex up the kamasucha too much.

00:24:16.220 --> 00:24:17.220
 No.

00:24:17.220 --> 00:24:18.820
 He wrote his own-- I think most of what we know about him

00:24:18.820 --> 00:24:20.340
 is from his own autobiography, and also

00:24:20.340 --> 00:24:22.460
 the biography of his adoring wife.

00:24:22.460 --> 00:24:25.700
 And he claimed that he learned Latin fluently at the age of three

00:24:25.700 --> 00:24:28.060
 and Greek fluently at the age of four.

00:24:28.060 --> 00:24:30.660
 And he could play chess blindfolded.

00:24:30.660 --> 00:24:32.940
 And he-- but he was amazing.

00:24:32.940 --> 00:24:34.100
 He just sort of traveled everywhere.

00:24:34.100 --> 00:24:37.660
 He ended up speaking 40 languages, got in loads of trouble.

00:24:37.660 --> 00:24:40.060
 I think he got-- he was a soldier in India.

00:24:40.060 --> 00:24:43.340
 And he got kicked out of India, and his life as a soldier

00:24:43.340 --> 00:24:45.700
 failed when his governor basically

00:24:45.700 --> 00:24:47.540
 asked him to investigate some rumors

00:24:47.540 --> 00:24:49.900
 that they'd heard about brothels in the city.

00:24:49.900 --> 00:24:51.900
 And because he had an eye for detail,

00:24:51.900 --> 00:24:53.900
 especially a lascivious detail, he just

00:24:53.900 --> 00:24:56.340
 investigated them way too hard.

00:24:56.340 --> 00:24:59.060
 So he spent lots and lots of time in brothels,

00:24:59.060 --> 00:25:02.900
 just taking meticulous notes about exactly what was going on.

00:25:02.900 --> 00:25:05.660
 And the authorities were like, fuck, this is rank, Richard.

00:25:05.660 --> 00:25:06.820
 Oh, go home.

00:25:06.820 --> 00:25:08.580
 You are sick.

00:25:08.580 --> 00:25:10.500
 And killed is grit.

00:25:10.500 --> 00:25:13.100
 Did you know that the queen has played Aladdin?

00:25:13.100 --> 00:25:15.700
 It was when she was-- it was during the war.

00:25:15.700 --> 00:25:18.140
 During the war, Queen Elizabeth played Aladdin

00:25:18.140 --> 00:25:22.620
 in the royal family's pantomime to raise money for soldiers.

00:25:22.620 --> 00:25:25.540
 I think they invited a small audience of aristocrats.

00:25:25.540 --> 00:25:28.660
 And she would have been in her early teens, I guess, at the time.

00:25:28.660 --> 00:25:29.340
 Yeah.

00:25:29.340 --> 00:25:32.260
 Queen-- her pre-queens, they call them in the royal family.

00:25:32.260 --> 00:25:35.140
 [LAUGHTER]

00:25:35.140 --> 00:25:36.100
 And was it with the others?

00:25:36.100 --> 00:25:39.460
 And it was, like, Margaret-- the parents or Margaret?

00:25:39.460 --> 00:25:43.660
 Margaret was in it, but I don't think she was playing the parents.

00:25:43.660 --> 00:25:47.180
 It's like when you're at school, when I was at school,

00:25:47.180 --> 00:25:50.580
 in the Nativity Play, when I was in the top,

00:25:50.580 --> 00:25:54.060
 yeah, I played Joseph, which was very nice.

00:25:54.060 --> 00:25:55.740
 The main part-- main role.

00:25:55.740 --> 00:25:57.020
 Yeah, I don't know if you know that.

00:25:57.020 --> 00:26:00.100
 Don't know if you know the Nativity story, but it's--

00:26:00.100 --> 00:26:01.220
 He's a pretty big deal at it.

00:26:01.220 --> 00:26:02.260
 This is a pretty big one.

00:26:02.260 --> 00:26:06.060
 My brother, in the same play, played a blade of grass.

00:26:06.060 --> 00:26:07.460
 [LAUGHTER]

00:26:07.460 --> 00:26:10.220
 Wow.

00:26:10.220 --> 00:26:11.740
 Wow.

00:26:11.740 --> 00:26:12.420
 Blade of grass.

00:26:12.420 --> 00:26:14.420
 They couldn't find a single bigger role

00:26:14.420 --> 00:26:16.860
 for him than a single blade of grass.

00:26:16.860 --> 00:26:18.340
 Not even a few blades of grass.

00:26:18.340 --> 00:26:20.180
 No, there was a few different--

00:26:20.180 --> 00:26:23.260
 I don't think he was, like, head blade of grass.

00:26:23.260 --> 00:26:26.140
 And he didn't have a speaking role.

00:26:26.140 --> 00:26:26.980
 I'm just trying to--

00:26:26.980 --> 00:26:28.780
 He didn't understand any blade of grass.

00:26:28.780 --> 00:26:32.500
 There's no sentient grass in the story.

00:26:32.500 --> 00:26:35.580
 But basically, you had the load of the kids

00:26:35.580 --> 00:26:38.260
 would kind of stand there and kind of wave in the breeze

00:26:38.260 --> 00:26:39.820
 as if they were a blade of grass.

00:26:39.820 --> 00:26:41.820
 I don't remember any grass being mentioned

00:26:41.820 --> 00:26:44.060
 in any version of the negativity I've ever heard.

00:26:44.060 --> 00:26:46.780
 Well, what did the donkey eat?

00:26:46.780 --> 00:26:48.780
 I guess straw?

00:26:48.780 --> 00:26:51.060
 What straw if it's not dry grass?

00:26:51.060 --> 00:26:52.020
 Yeah, fair enough.

00:26:52.020 --> 00:26:54.780
 So where's his role to be eaten by the donkey at some point?

00:26:54.780 --> 00:26:58.380
 [LAUGHTER]

00:26:58.380 --> 00:27:01.540
 Oh, my goodness.

00:27:01.540 --> 00:27:03.900
 OK, it is time for fact number three.

00:27:03.900 --> 00:27:05.140
 And that is my fact.

00:27:05.140 --> 00:27:07.540
 My fact this week is that merry grounds

00:27:07.540 --> 00:27:12.140
 were invented in medieval times for nights to ride on.

00:27:12.140 --> 00:27:16.460
 So this is carousels for any Americans listening.

00:27:16.460 --> 00:27:19.220
 The merry ground has a very long history.

00:27:19.220 --> 00:27:21.780
 It sort of originates back in the 12th century.

00:27:21.780 --> 00:27:25.260
 There was a game that was played on horseback

00:27:25.260 --> 00:27:30.660
 where a sort of scented ball used to be tossed around to people.

00:27:30.660 --> 00:27:33.140
 And if you dropped it, or if it smashed on you,

00:27:33.140 --> 00:27:35.020
 it would release a kind of perfume.

00:27:35.020 --> 00:27:38.180
 And that perfume would stink you up for the rest of the match.

00:27:38.180 --> 00:27:42.820
 And that word was carouselo, which meant little war.

00:27:42.820 --> 00:27:44.900
 Carouselo is a sort of bastardization

00:27:44.900 --> 00:27:47.980
 of it by the Italians who took it on.

00:27:47.980 --> 00:27:52.140
 And then they realized how useful this was in combat training

00:27:52.140 --> 00:27:52.860
 purposes.

00:27:52.860 --> 00:27:57.060
 And so little war, carouselo slowly

00:27:57.060 --> 00:28:01.620
 morphed into nights sitting on what were effectively

00:28:01.620 --> 00:28:02.620
 saddles.

00:28:02.620 --> 00:28:05.420
 And they would go around a pole on chains.

00:28:05.420 --> 00:28:09.020
 And they would have to try and lance with their lances

00:28:09.020 --> 00:28:10.380
 a little ring.

00:28:10.380 --> 00:28:12.660
 And that was the very beginnings of what

00:28:12.660 --> 00:28:14.580
 eventually turned into what we now

00:28:14.580 --> 00:28:16.660
 have as the modern day carousel.

00:28:16.660 --> 00:28:19.180
 So yeah, it was originally for night training.

00:28:19.180 --> 00:28:22.980
 So this game where you throw balls at people.

00:28:22.980 --> 00:28:24.660
 And if you drop them, they make you

00:28:24.660 --> 00:28:27.860
 smell like perfume.

00:28:27.860 --> 00:28:29.700
 What's the point in that?

00:28:29.700 --> 00:28:33.460
 I think it's really weird.

00:28:33.460 --> 00:28:35.820
 Basically, if you smell like perfume,

00:28:35.820 --> 00:28:37.020
 you smell quite nice.

00:28:37.020 --> 00:28:39.180
 And the other people will smell like they've been riding around

00:28:39.180 --> 00:28:40.340
 on a horse all afternoon.

00:28:40.340 --> 00:28:41.740
 They'll be sweaty and disgusting.

00:28:41.740 --> 00:28:44.340
 And supposedly, there's perfume people of the losers.

00:28:44.340 --> 00:28:45.140
 I say they've won.

00:28:45.140 --> 00:28:46.140
 I agree.

00:28:46.140 --> 00:28:47.980
 Because I read about this as well.

00:28:47.980 --> 00:28:49.700
 And that was the one thing that stuck with me.

00:28:49.700 --> 00:28:51.180
 This seems like a pretty stupid--

00:28:51.180 --> 00:28:53.500
 a bit like Quidditch being a stupid game.

00:28:53.500 --> 00:28:55.780
 This is kind of a stupid game where it's not really

00:28:55.780 --> 00:28:59.380
 obvious what the point of winning or losing is.

00:28:59.380 --> 00:29:00.820
 I just didn't like it at all.

00:29:00.820 --> 00:29:02.580
 You wouldn't say that James about Quidditch

00:29:02.580 --> 00:29:06.260
 to the people who play Quidditch in the park near my house.

00:29:06.260 --> 00:29:08.820
 And they're not even flying.

00:29:08.820 --> 00:29:10.540
 Are they a scary looking bunch?

00:29:10.540 --> 00:29:11.820
 They've all got sticks.

00:29:11.820 --> 00:29:12.340
 That's true.

00:29:12.340 --> 00:29:13.900
 Although the sticks do have to be clamped

00:29:13.900 --> 00:29:17.820
 between their legs, otherwise it's easy.

00:29:17.820 --> 00:29:19.220
 I think it's the shame of it, right?

00:29:19.220 --> 00:29:21.940
 So Andy could sit at the stinking of perfume

00:29:21.940 --> 00:29:23.900
 in the dining hall afterwards shrieking.

00:29:23.900 --> 00:29:26.260
 I've won in most senses at the word.

00:29:26.260 --> 00:29:27.500
 He likes.

00:29:27.500 --> 00:29:30.300
 But in the end, everyone knows that you've lost.

00:29:30.300 --> 00:29:30.980
 That's true.

00:29:30.980 --> 00:29:33.660
 I suppose if you play an actual spot and then you

00:29:33.660 --> 00:29:36.580
 go to the pub afterwards, you don't really know who's lost.

00:29:36.580 --> 00:29:39.380
 It's not obvious to everyone else in the pub who's lost.

00:29:39.380 --> 00:29:40.380
 But then everyone--

00:29:40.380 --> 00:29:43.020
 As Anna points out, it is obvious.

00:29:43.020 --> 00:29:44.940
 Because any time I finish playing sport,

00:29:44.940 --> 00:29:45.740
 I'm the one who's lost.

00:29:45.740 --> 00:29:51.140
 It's so early carousels, though.

00:29:51.140 --> 00:29:53.380
 They were powered by animals walking in a circle,

00:29:53.380 --> 00:29:54.340
 which I had no idea about.

00:29:54.340 --> 00:29:56.580
 So instead of, as well as having a fake horse

00:29:56.580 --> 00:29:58.980
 that you'd be riding on, there would be a real horse.

00:29:58.980 --> 00:30:01.260
 Why don't you just get on the real horse?

00:30:01.260 --> 00:30:05.500
 Like, if the whole point is to train how to ride horses,

00:30:05.500 --> 00:30:07.340
 and you've got an actual horse there,

00:30:07.340 --> 00:30:09.980
 why are you sitting on the fake one?

00:30:09.980 --> 00:30:10.740
 Yeah, it's true.

00:30:10.740 --> 00:30:11.660
 Very weird.

00:30:11.660 --> 00:30:15.260
 Those horses-- I mean, that is so demeaning for those horses.

00:30:15.260 --> 00:30:17.300
 Imagine your job being to pull around

00:30:17.300 --> 00:30:22.100
 a fake, much less developed version of yourself.

00:30:22.100 --> 00:30:24.900
 Well, that's basically taking your child for a walk in the park,

00:30:24.900 --> 00:30:25.700
 isn't it?

00:30:25.700 --> 00:30:27.860
 [LAUGHTER]

00:30:27.860 --> 00:30:30.540
 Because they used to put knights on loose horses

00:30:30.540 --> 00:30:31.860
 and sort of push them around.

00:30:31.860 --> 00:30:34.420
 They would have squires pulling the horses

00:30:34.420 --> 00:30:36.820
 so that they could practice their jousting.

00:30:36.820 --> 00:30:38.140
 What do you mean fake horses?

00:30:38.140 --> 00:30:38.900
 Like wooden horses?

00:30:38.900 --> 00:30:41.220
 Yeah, wooden horses, exactly.

00:30:41.220 --> 00:30:45.060
 They would try and hit a target called a quintane, wouldn't they?

00:30:45.060 --> 00:30:46.860
 Which we've mentioned on QI a quintane,

00:30:46.860 --> 00:30:48.420
 but I don't think we've mentioned here.

00:30:48.420 --> 00:30:53.140
 And it basically is a-- it's a wooden post with a target on,

00:30:53.140 --> 00:30:55.020
 and the target is on a bit of a lever.

00:30:55.020 --> 00:30:57.460
 So when you hit it, it flips around.

00:30:57.460 --> 00:31:00.780
 And that was the way that you would test how to do jousting.

00:31:00.780 --> 00:31:03.220
 It was a crucial for jousting training,

00:31:03.220 --> 00:31:06.220
 but jousting wasn't the most crucial thing that knights

00:31:06.220 --> 00:31:07.700
 did in competitions, right?

00:31:07.700 --> 00:31:08.980
 I think we've mentioned this on QI.

00:31:08.980 --> 00:31:10.780
 But for most of the Middle Ages,

00:31:10.780 --> 00:31:12.900
 if you went to a tournament as a knight,

00:31:12.900 --> 00:31:16.660
 they did the melee, which was like a very chaotic--

00:31:16.660 --> 00:31:19.620
 it's like the Royal Rumble, wasn't it, melee?

00:31:19.620 --> 00:31:21.380
 What's the Royal Rumble?

00:31:21.380 --> 00:31:25.780
 Well, it began in medieval times.

00:31:25.780 --> 00:31:26.980
 Goddamn it.

00:31:26.980 --> 00:31:28.460
 That explained what the Royal Rumble is.

00:31:28.460 --> 00:31:30.820
 Nana's told us if this is the same as a melee.

00:31:30.820 --> 00:31:36.540
 Royal Rumble is a WWE event where you have about 30 wrestlers

00:31:36.540 --> 00:31:39.740
 who will all attack each other at the same time in the ring.

00:31:39.740 --> 00:31:42.300
 They're staggered in, so you would have someone two people

00:31:42.300 --> 00:31:44.980
 started off, and then let's say every two minutes,

00:31:44.980 --> 00:31:47.820
 a new person enters the ring, to win the match,

00:31:47.820 --> 00:31:50.020
 you have to flip someone over the top rope,

00:31:50.020 --> 00:31:51.700
 and they have to make contact with the floor.

00:31:51.700 --> 00:31:53.940
 So it's not exactly the same.

00:31:53.940 --> 00:31:56.300
 So it's the same way that there's loads of them involved

00:31:56.300 --> 00:31:57.740
 or fighting each other, right?

00:31:57.740 --> 00:31:58.740
 Yeah, exactly.

00:31:58.740 --> 00:32:01.180
 But also, like in the Royal Rumble, in the melee,

00:32:01.180 --> 00:32:03.100
 you could kind of sneak in the corner

00:32:03.100 --> 00:32:05.300
 and hide under some coats or something,

00:32:05.300 --> 00:32:08.460
 and let everyone else beat each other in the fight,

00:32:08.460 --> 00:32:10.660
 and then you could jump out at the last minute and fight.

00:32:10.660 --> 00:32:14.340
 Classic, classic Sean Michaels tactic of WWF.

00:32:14.340 --> 00:32:15.180
 Absolutely.

00:32:15.180 --> 00:32:17.900
 Well, he actually got it from the medieval English.

00:32:17.900 --> 00:32:21.740
 Are there coats in the corner during a wrestling match?

00:32:21.740 --> 00:32:22.980
 It feels like, as you're coming,

00:32:22.980 --> 00:32:26.660
 he just, "Oh, leave your coat on the bed, we'll be."

00:32:26.660 --> 00:32:28.740
 The English used to be famous for this strategy,

00:32:28.740 --> 00:32:31.260
 where if there were lots of different groups around,

00:32:31.260 --> 00:32:32.820
 the English would say they weren't going to play.

00:32:32.820 --> 00:32:34.780
 They're not interested in the melee at all,

00:32:34.780 --> 00:32:36.460
 so that all the other teams would play

00:32:36.460 --> 00:32:38.180
 and really, really tie each other out.

00:32:38.180 --> 00:32:40.060
 This was around the time of Henry II,

00:32:40.060 --> 00:32:42.980
 and once all the other teams are really, really tied out,

00:32:42.980 --> 00:32:45.460
 they've been knocked off their horses, they've run out of steam,

00:32:45.460 --> 00:32:46.980
 the English suddenly would gallop in,

00:32:46.980 --> 00:32:49.020
 and so we'd change our minds of playing, we're playing,

00:32:49.020 --> 00:32:52.060
 and then they'd completely vanquished everyone else on the pitch.

00:32:52.060 --> 00:32:53.660
 -Wow. -That was what we were known for.

00:32:53.660 --> 00:32:56.660
 Well, they probably, they wouldn't invite us back to the next melee,

00:32:56.660 --> 00:32:58.020
 would they?

00:32:58.020 --> 00:32:59.700
 We were, they're still doing them in France,

00:32:59.700 --> 00:33:01.860
 so we just never, we haven't been asked for 800 years.

00:33:01.860 --> 00:33:04.740
 -Oh. -But the reason jousting became popular,

00:33:04.740 --> 00:33:07.100
 do you know why it was switched to jousting from melee?

00:33:07.100 --> 00:33:07.780
 No.

00:33:07.780 --> 00:33:11.420
 This is that knights were so violent, they were massive thugs,

00:33:11.420 --> 00:33:12.900
 and it was a serious problem.

00:33:12.900 --> 00:33:14.780
 So the first ever mass peace movement,

00:33:14.780 --> 00:33:16.140
 the peace and truth of God movement,

00:33:16.140 --> 00:33:20.140
 was basically to stop knights from killing each other and everyone else.

00:33:20.140 --> 00:33:22.900
 And they, so they used to do things like a knights tournament,

00:33:22.900 --> 00:33:24.500
 wouldn't just be in one area,

00:33:24.500 --> 00:33:26.700
 until the, quite near the end of the Middle Ages,

00:33:26.700 --> 00:33:29.220
 a knights tournament would be across the countryside,

00:33:29.220 --> 00:33:32.380
 so you have 29, and they're just fighting each other,

00:33:32.380 --> 00:33:33.660
 they gallop across the countryside,

00:33:33.660 --> 00:33:34.740
 they used to do things like,

00:33:34.740 --> 00:33:36.820
 they bash down the doors of peasant's homes,

00:33:36.820 --> 00:33:38.020
 and be like, you've got to give me a shelter,

00:33:38.020 --> 00:33:39.300
 let me hide in your cupboard,

00:33:39.300 --> 00:33:40.460
 and then if another knight came,

00:33:40.460 --> 00:33:42.140
 then they'd burn down the peasant's house,

00:33:42.140 --> 00:33:44.220
 to burn the knight's house, to get rid of him.

00:33:44.220 --> 00:33:45.300
 There's nothing you can do,

00:33:45.300 --> 00:33:47.780
 as a peasant, you're obliged to give knights bed and board,

00:33:47.780 --> 00:33:48.900
 if they ask for it.

00:33:48.900 --> 00:33:50.900
 And they used to ruin people's crops,

00:33:50.900 --> 00:33:53.740
 you know, they'd burn down fences and hedges.

00:33:53.740 --> 00:33:55.260
 It was just chaos, and so...

00:33:55.260 --> 00:33:56.220
 That was amazing.

00:33:56.220 --> 00:33:59.100
 It's had super fun, incredibly fun,

00:33:59.100 --> 00:34:00.860
 and I think mainly the clergy said,

00:34:00.860 --> 00:34:02.580
 this is getting out of control.

00:34:02.580 --> 00:34:05.060
 Let's make it one-on-one about the shall we.

00:34:05.060 --> 00:34:07.620
 So if you had a house, and the knight came along,

00:34:07.620 --> 00:34:10.140
 and they said, we want to stay in your house,

00:34:10.140 --> 00:34:11.740
 you had to let them stay.

00:34:11.740 --> 00:34:14.020
 It was actually if it was your Lord,

00:34:14.020 --> 00:34:15.780
 but yeah, it would usually be that guy,

00:34:15.780 --> 00:34:18.340
 and you had to feed them for as long as they wanted feeding,

00:34:18.340 --> 00:34:19.460
 and give them somewhere to sleep,

00:34:19.460 --> 00:34:20.300
 which was pretty harsh,

00:34:20.300 --> 00:34:21.660
 because they obviously had enough to eat,

00:34:21.660 --> 00:34:22.940
 and by and large, you didn't.

00:34:22.940 --> 00:34:23.900
 Yeah.

00:34:23.900 --> 00:34:25.300
 They must have come over and said,

00:34:25.300 --> 00:34:26.140
 can I stay with you?

00:34:26.140 --> 00:34:27.300
 And you said, how many knights?

00:34:27.300 --> 00:34:28.980
 And they said, well, there's 600 others.

00:34:28.980 --> 00:34:31.220
 LAUGHTER

00:34:31.220 --> 00:34:34.820
 On innovations of how it slowly evolved

00:34:34.820 --> 00:34:38.340
 into the modern-day carousel merry-ground that we have,

00:34:38.340 --> 00:34:40.140
 I was trying to find at what points

00:34:40.140 --> 00:34:42.460
 it sort of turned more and more into what we have,

00:34:42.460 --> 00:34:45.340
 and I discovered, now I'm still on the case

00:34:45.340 --> 00:34:47.340
 with this investigation, I must say.

00:34:47.340 --> 00:34:49.060
 So this might be wrong,

00:34:49.060 --> 00:34:53.100
 but I think that the person who invented the device

00:34:53.100 --> 00:34:55.860
 that allowed the horse to go up and down the pole

00:34:55.860 --> 00:34:57.660
 as it's going round,

00:34:57.660 --> 00:34:58.980
 you see, you know what I'm talking about?

00:34:58.980 --> 00:35:00.740
 How, yeah, so it's a string fellow.

00:35:00.740 --> 00:35:01.740
 Yeah.

00:35:01.740 --> 00:35:04.580
 LAUGHTER

00:35:04.580 --> 00:35:08.820
 It was a bad called Merlin, which is a nice-- No.

00:35:08.820 --> 00:35:13.140
 Yeah, I believe that it was a man called John Joseph Merlin.

00:35:13.140 --> 00:35:15.780
 Now, he's been mentioned on the podcast before,

00:35:15.780 --> 00:35:18.180
 because he was the man who invented roller skates

00:35:18.180 --> 00:35:21.780
 and first displayed them when he played a violin at a party

00:35:21.780 --> 00:35:24.140
 and ended up crashing into a giant mirror.

00:35:24.140 --> 00:35:26.580
 You remember him, this is that very same man.

00:35:26.580 --> 00:35:31.700
 And he was an amazing inventor during his lifetime

00:35:31.700 --> 00:35:33.340
 of living in London, particularly.

00:35:33.340 --> 00:35:35.580
 He was from Belgium to begin with.

00:35:35.580 --> 00:35:37.300
 And he invented all sorts of things

00:35:37.300 --> 00:35:40.020
 like a self-propelled wheelchair.

00:35:40.020 --> 00:35:43.820
 He had a pedal-operated revolving tea table.

00:35:43.820 --> 00:35:46.820
 He had mechanical chariots that used to go around London.

00:35:46.820 --> 00:35:50.500
 And he had his own museum, which was called the Merlin's Mechanical

00:35:50.500 --> 00:35:55.380
 Museum, and in it is the description of this carousel

00:35:55.380 --> 00:35:58.500
 with horses that go up and down and noble people

00:35:58.500 --> 00:36:02.100
 and rich people of the time used to come and hire it out,

00:36:02.100 --> 00:36:04.500
 specifically just to have rides on it at this place.

00:36:04.500 --> 00:36:08.660
 So this is, he died at the beginning of 1800, 1803.

00:36:08.660 --> 00:36:10.820
 So we're talking late 1700s here.

00:36:10.820 --> 00:36:13.500
 It's the first description that I can find of that innovation

00:36:13.500 --> 00:36:16.220
 of the horse going up and down, invented by Merlin.

00:36:16.220 --> 00:36:19.740
 So is your theory that Merlin first existed in the 1800s,

00:36:19.740 --> 00:36:22.060
 invented that, and then went back in time to King Arthur

00:36:22.060 --> 00:36:25.500
 and co, and brought with him his training after the night?

00:36:25.500 --> 00:36:28.020
 Well, you've taken the theory further, but I'm on board.

00:36:28.020 --> 00:36:30.940
 I absolutely will fold that into the idea.

00:36:30.940 --> 00:36:34.420
 And Merlin, I believe, in the Disney Sword and the Stone,

00:36:34.420 --> 00:36:37.860
 which is very closely original story, it's not.

00:36:37.860 --> 00:36:40.300
 Merlin at the end enters on roller skates.

00:36:40.300 --> 00:36:41.420
 Is he?

00:36:41.420 --> 00:36:45.420
 So this is all coming together, fairly certain.

00:36:45.420 --> 00:36:47.540
 Wow, it's just a shame no one will hear it once, James.

00:36:47.540 --> 00:36:48.540
 Is that it?

00:36:48.540 --> 00:36:55.900
 Oh, I have a fact about aeroplane rides at a fun fair.

00:36:55.900 --> 00:36:59.540
 OK, so the flight simulating aeroplane ride at a fun fair,

00:36:59.540 --> 00:37:01.940
 where you sit in a little plane and it moves up

00:37:01.940 --> 00:37:03.460
 and left and right and rolls around a bit.

00:37:03.460 --> 00:37:06.020
 That was invented to train pilots.

00:37:06.020 --> 00:37:07.020
 Wow.

00:37:07.020 --> 00:37:07.660
 That is terrifying.

00:37:07.660 --> 00:37:14.700
 Genuinely, this was built in the early '30s, I think,

00:37:14.700 --> 00:37:17.260
 maybe late '20s, by an event called Lee Ily.

00:37:17.260 --> 00:37:20.060
 He built a small plane called the orientator,

00:37:20.060 --> 00:37:21.660
 and it would tilt left and right.

00:37:21.660 --> 00:37:23.820
 It was in this huge y-shaped fork.

00:37:23.820 --> 00:37:27.180
 So the plane was stuck in the y of the fork, as it were.

00:37:27.180 --> 00:37:29.500
 And it would turn and roll and twist.

00:37:29.500 --> 00:37:32.420
 And he thought this would be useful for training pilots.

00:37:32.420 --> 00:37:34.660
 And he only sold five of them, all of them

00:37:34.660 --> 00:37:37.500
 to the Cuban government.

00:37:37.500 --> 00:37:40.220
 And that's what it was used for.

00:37:40.220 --> 00:37:41.940
 And then a friend of his saw it and said,

00:37:41.940 --> 00:37:44.260
 have you suggested turning it into a carnival ride?

00:37:44.260 --> 00:37:46.140
 Because that looks really fun.

00:37:46.140 --> 00:37:48.100
 And that's what he did.

00:37:48.100 --> 00:37:49.820
 And he spent the rest of his life inventing

00:37:49.820 --> 00:37:52.540
 the Lupo plane and the Rollo plane and the Rocco plane

00:37:52.540 --> 00:37:53.540
 and all these rides.

00:37:53.540 --> 00:37:54.140
 That's amazing.

00:37:54.140 --> 00:37:56.780
 I mean, you've got the carousel, which

00:37:56.780 --> 00:37:59.380
 was for training nights, and you've got this for training.

00:37:59.380 --> 00:38:02.420
 You know, that big boat that kind of goes up and down

00:38:02.420 --> 00:38:03.380
 in a rocking motion.

00:38:03.380 --> 00:38:06.260
 Is that to train Vikings or something?

00:38:06.260 --> 00:38:07.060
 Yeah.

00:38:07.060 --> 00:38:10.780
 That's where Admiral Nelson was going to describe us.

00:38:10.780 --> 00:38:14.020
 [MUSIC PLAYING]

00:38:14.020 --> 00:38:16.780
 OK, it is time for our final fact of the show.

00:38:16.780 --> 00:38:18.900
 And that is James.

00:38:18.900 --> 00:38:22.540
 OK, my fact this week is that in some parts of Japan,

00:38:22.540 --> 00:38:25.900
 earwigs are known as Chinpo Kiri.

00:38:25.900 --> 00:38:30.580
 Literally penis cutters.

00:38:30.580 --> 00:38:34.820
 They're much more powerful in Japan.

00:38:34.820 --> 00:38:37.700
 I don't think they're literally cutting penises.

00:38:37.700 --> 00:38:41.900
 I think it might be-- well, OK, so let me tell you where I found this.

00:38:41.900 --> 00:38:44.340
 It basically came up on my RSS feed last week.

00:38:44.340 --> 00:38:46.260
 But I went to look for evidence.

00:38:46.260 --> 00:38:49.860
 I found a paper from 2013 from a Japanese entomologist

00:38:49.860 --> 00:38:54.660
 called Kenta Takada called vulgar dialects names of earwigs

00:38:54.660 --> 00:38:57.580
 used in the Kansai region of Japan.

00:38:57.580 --> 00:39:01.100
 OK, so I went on to Google Translate

00:39:01.100 --> 00:39:02.820
 because this paper was in Japanese.

00:39:02.820 --> 00:39:06.020
 And it seems like the reason that they're called this

00:39:06.020 --> 00:39:09.340
 is when they have penises in the back earwigs don't they.

00:39:09.340 --> 00:39:11.820
 On their bumps, they have like these little penises.

00:39:11.820 --> 00:39:14.860
 And also in Japan, in this particular area,

00:39:14.860 --> 00:39:18.420
 Kansai area, which is round Oscar and wherever,

00:39:18.420 --> 00:39:20.460
 they were found in toilets.

00:39:20.460 --> 00:39:21.780
 They were found around toilets.

00:39:21.780 --> 00:39:24.500
 So it might be that if you see something

00:39:24.500 --> 00:39:26.140
 with pinces on it around the toilets,

00:39:26.140 --> 00:39:29.020
 you might call it a penis cutter because it's like there

00:39:29.020 --> 00:39:31.020
 might be a folklore that that would happen.

00:39:31.020 --> 00:39:32.900
 Yeah, makes sense.

00:39:32.900 --> 00:39:35.820
 So we don't think they actually cut penises.

00:39:35.820 --> 00:39:38.820
 But it's just that it so happens that in this particular part

00:39:38.820 --> 00:39:42.900
 of Japan, they give it a rude name.

00:39:42.900 --> 00:39:45.700
 I'm sure you guys have researched earwig penises.

00:39:45.700 --> 00:39:46.220
 Oh, yeah.

00:39:46.220 --> 00:39:46.700
 All over it.

00:39:46.700 --> 00:39:49.700
 Because this is another Japanese connection.

00:39:49.700 --> 00:39:52.460
 If you search Japan earwig penis,

00:39:52.460 --> 00:39:56.020
 it brings up a study done by Yoshitaka Kamimura

00:39:56.020 --> 00:39:58.540
 of the Tokyo Metropolitan University

00:39:58.540 --> 00:40:02.140
 who deliberately broke earwig penises off

00:40:02.140 --> 00:40:04.380
 while they were mid-sex.

00:40:04.380 --> 00:40:05.660
 That's not very nice.

00:40:05.660 --> 00:40:07.100
 Just out of my ass.

00:40:07.100 --> 00:40:07.940
 Not out of my ass.

00:40:07.940 --> 00:40:10.340
 So there is a species.

00:40:10.340 --> 00:40:13.140
 Lots of species have two penises.

00:40:13.140 --> 00:40:15.340
 The males do anyway.

00:40:15.340 --> 00:40:17.900
 And there was a lot of theorizing about whether they were used

00:40:17.900 --> 00:40:18.900
 or not.

00:40:18.900 --> 00:40:24.540
 And so Yoshitaka Kamimura, he decided to test it

00:40:24.540 --> 00:40:25.700
 and his colleagues.

00:40:25.700 --> 00:40:27.820
 And they would interrupt mating earwigs

00:40:27.820 --> 00:40:29.580
 by pinching the male and lifting him off.

00:40:29.580 --> 00:40:31.660
 And because they're very, very, very long penises

00:40:31.660 --> 00:40:33.900
 relative to the earwig, they're the same length again.

00:40:33.900 --> 00:40:36.900
 They're quite easily broken and they're quite sensitive.

00:40:36.900 --> 00:40:39.780
 So the penises all broke off.

00:40:39.780 --> 00:40:43.260
 But within two days, they found that these males

00:40:43.260 --> 00:40:46.740
 who'd had a penis broken off could inseminate new females

00:40:46.740 --> 00:40:48.020
 they were introduced to.

00:40:48.020 --> 00:40:52.140
 And they collected 663 of these earwigs from around Japan

00:40:52.140 --> 00:40:55.460
 just to test whether they had been undergoing similar problems

00:40:55.460 --> 00:40:57.060
 without the scientists interfering

00:40:57.060 --> 00:40:58.900
 and snapping their penises off.

00:40:58.900 --> 00:41:01.180
 And they found that only a few had had sexual accidents

00:41:01.180 --> 00:41:02.540
 like this, but a few had.

00:41:02.540 --> 00:41:04.100
 So three males had lost a penis.

00:41:04.100 --> 00:41:08.580
 And two females had a severed penis inside them

00:41:08.580 --> 00:41:09.940
 from an earlier.

00:41:09.940 --> 00:41:12.660
 So that's only one penis unaccounted for from those.

00:41:12.660 --> 00:41:13.500
 It's good.

00:41:13.500 --> 00:41:16.940
 Keep your eyes peeled.

00:41:16.940 --> 00:41:18.340
 The other thing that was the second penis

00:41:18.340 --> 00:41:19.580
 is the wrong way around, right?

00:41:19.580 --> 00:41:22.380
 So they must have to learn a whole new sexual position

00:41:22.380 --> 00:41:24.500
 in that two-day period.

00:41:24.500 --> 00:41:26.860
 I assumed it just moved into the position

00:41:26.860 --> 00:41:29.220
 vacated by the first one, but you might well be right.

00:41:29.220 --> 00:41:30.820
 Oh, OK, I don't know.

00:41:30.820 --> 00:41:35.300
 Well, they think they have two because they used to use

00:41:35.300 --> 00:41:36.620
 both at the same time.

00:41:36.620 --> 00:41:38.660
 Well, some species only have one.

00:41:38.660 --> 00:41:41.140
 Some species only have one, but of the ones who have two,

00:41:41.140 --> 00:41:45.340
 they think that some females might have had a double vagina.

00:41:45.340 --> 00:41:47.740
 I think they've found double vaginaed females, right?

00:41:47.740 --> 00:41:51.020
 But they've never witnessed the double penises

00:41:51.020 --> 00:41:52.460
 interacting with the double vaginas.

00:41:52.460 --> 00:41:55.540
 But it does seem like the obvious thing, doesn't it?

00:41:55.540 --> 00:41:59.460
 If you've ever seen a glove and a hand,

00:41:59.460 --> 00:42:01.500
 you do automatically see what's going in the other.

00:42:01.500 --> 00:42:07.500
 But then you do find men with only one hand,

00:42:07.500 --> 00:42:08.980
 and they're women with an extra hand

00:42:08.980 --> 00:42:10.500
 found in their glove, don't you?

00:42:10.500 --> 00:42:13.340
 [LAUGHTER]

00:42:13.340 --> 00:42:19.060
 I was just wondering if maybe the Japanese name penis cutters

00:42:19.060 --> 00:42:21.820
 might be because they cut their own penis off sometimes

00:42:21.820 --> 00:42:24.980
 when it falls off accidentally.

00:42:24.980 --> 00:42:27.700
 So maybe it's not you're worried about your own penis.

00:42:27.700 --> 00:42:29.260
 You're kind of worried about the--

00:42:29.260 --> 00:42:30.700
 No, I don't think that's true.

00:42:30.700 --> 00:42:32.500
 I don't think so.

00:42:32.500 --> 00:42:34.660
 I really, really don't like earwigs.

00:42:34.660 --> 00:42:37.100
 And I very rarely come across them in my day-to-day life.

00:42:37.100 --> 00:42:39.340
 But I remember, as a child, thinking they're really

00:42:39.340 --> 00:42:41.020
 scaring, because they can really net view.

00:42:41.020 --> 00:42:42.020
 Can they?

00:42:42.020 --> 00:42:44.180
 Yeah, when they get their little pincers together,

00:42:44.180 --> 00:42:45.220
 they can really be--

00:42:45.220 --> 00:42:46.700
 I don't know if I've ever seen one.

00:42:46.700 --> 00:42:47.540
 Yeah, I've never seen one.

00:42:47.540 --> 00:42:48.460
 Weirdly.

00:42:48.460 --> 00:42:49.740
 You've never seen a name?

00:42:49.740 --> 00:42:54.500
 They're a bit like any movie from before, 1993.

00:42:54.500 --> 00:42:56.380
 But I don't recall ever seen it.

00:42:56.380 --> 00:42:58.340
 You get them in the UK, I suppose you must do,

00:42:58.340 --> 00:42:59.380
 but I don't remember.

00:42:59.380 --> 00:43:00.780
 I cannot believe this is literally

00:43:00.780 --> 00:43:02.020
 like you've never seen an ant.

00:43:02.020 --> 00:43:03.020
 I've never seen one.

00:43:03.020 --> 00:43:04.620
 Well, you just have never looked at the floor.

00:43:04.620 --> 00:43:06.180
 I just think maybe I've seen them

00:43:06.180 --> 00:43:08.300
 and just thought it was a beetle or something.

00:43:08.300 --> 00:43:09.020
 Yeah.

00:43:09.020 --> 00:43:11.300
 They look like little scorpions, really, don't they?

00:43:11.300 --> 00:43:13.100
 Because of the pincers.

00:43:13.100 --> 00:43:15.380
 And the pincers are-- they're very strange,

00:43:15.380 --> 00:43:17.300
 because it's quite weird having this defensive device

00:43:17.300 --> 00:43:18.620
 on your backside.

00:43:18.620 --> 00:43:22.420
 And it has a few purposes, but one is for males

00:43:22.420 --> 00:43:26.380
 to spar with each other and to show who's dominant or whatever.

00:43:26.380 --> 00:43:28.820
 But I was watching a video of two male earwig sparring

00:43:28.820 --> 00:43:30.260
 with their pincers, and it's so awkward,

00:43:30.260 --> 00:43:33.500
 because imagine kind of having to spar with someone

00:43:33.500 --> 00:43:35.380
 with your butt cheeks.

00:43:35.380 --> 00:43:37.980
 So they have to prey around with their necks

00:43:37.980 --> 00:43:42.060
 to try and control their pincers, so they're jumping at each other.

00:43:42.060 --> 00:43:43.260
 It's just-- it's so--

00:43:43.260 --> 00:43:45.260
 That is a royal rumble, I want to see.

00:43:45.260 --> 00:43:47.900
 [LAUGHTER]

00:43:47.900 --> 00:43:49.620
 You're only allowed to use your butt.

00:43:49.620 --> 00:43:50.220
 Yeah.

00:43:50.220 --> 00:43:52.660
 Leave your coat on the bed, and leave your trousers under it.

00:43:52.660 --> 00:43:56.180
 [LAUGHTER]

00:43:56.180 --> 00:44:00.740
 Well, also, it's not a fight to the death.

00:44:00.740 --> 00:44:02.580
 It's just a fight to when someone's like,

00:44:02.580 --> 00:44:03.860
 oh, OK, I've had it off.

00:44:03.860 --> 00:44:06.380
 And they declare a winner, and they go off

00:44:06.380 --> 00:44:09.940
 and they burrow themselves in a sort of shameful hiding,

00:44:09.940 --> 00:44:10.860
 don't they?

00:44:10.860 --> 00:44:11.780
 Yeah, what?

00:44:11.780 --> 00:44:14.220
 Yeah, they get-- it's sort of like once you've lost,

00:44:14.220 --> 00:44:17.460
 they jump away, and then they dig themselves a hole

00:44:17.460 --> 00:44:18.260
 and stay in there.

00:44:18.260 --> 00:44:21.260
 And the victor is sort of like, yeah, I don't know why.

00:44:21.260 --> 00:44:21.900
 Wow.

00:44:21.900 --> 00:44:24.060
 So they can cry in peace, I think.

00:44:24.060 --> 00:44:25.940
 Once Andy had had that scented ball

00:44:25.940 --> 00:44:28.300
 explode all over his face, he spent some time alone

00:44:28.300 --> 00:44:30.020
 in a bathroom cubicle, didn't he?

00:44:30.020 --> 00:44:33.020
 [LAUGHTER]

00:44:33.020 --> 00:44:33.820
 That's amazing.

00:44:33.820 --> 00:44:36.780
 It's amazing that Earwigs have shame and honor codes,

00:44:36.780 --> 00:44:38.060
 like there are any of us.

00:44:38.060 --> 00:44:39.460
 I'm just surprised.

00:44:39.460 --> 00:44:41.180
 And they've got very strong family values.

00:44:41.180 --> 00:44:43.180
 So the sibling stayed together much longer

00:44:43.180 --> 00:44:44.020
 than they need to.

00:44:44.020 --> 00:44:47.300
 Another Earwig raises her young, and she's very attached,

00:44:47.300 --> 00:44:49.660
 and she's very sweet, so she sits on her eggs

00:44:49.660 --> 00:44:51.820
 and then on her nymphs on her baby Earwigs.

00:44:51.820 --> 00:44:53.700
 She'll sit on top of them all to nurture them

00:44:53.700 --> 00:44:56.540
 and lick all the mold and fungi off them.

00:44:56.540 --> 00:44:59.540
 And then the Earwigs are ready to leave the nest

00:44:59.540 --> 00:45:02.020
 very early on, but they all stay together anyway.

00:45:02.020 --> 00:45:03.780
 And they think it might be something to do with the fact

00:45:03.780 --> 00:45:06.020
 that they all eat other's feces.

00:45:06.020 --> 00:45:07.820
 So when time gets up--

00:45:07.820 --> 00:45:09.500
 That was so nice until then.

00:45:09.500 --> 00:45:11.860
 It was reminded me of how during lockdown,

00:45:11.860 --> 00:45:15.380
 I'm seeing a lot of my family on Zoom quizzes and stuff.

00:45:15.380 --> 00:45:17.060
 I'm like, oh, we're a bit like Earwigs,

00:45:17.060 --> 00:45:18.700
 but we don't eat each other's shit.

00:45:18.700 --> 00:45:20.460
 Well, it's one of the main problems with Zoom, isn't it?

00:45:20.460 --> 00:45:22.060
 And then they're trying to overcome this problem

00:45:22.060 --> 00:45:23.820
 with the technology.

00:45:23.820 --> 00:45:25.740
 Because these guys eat each other's poop.

00:45:25.740 --> 00:45:27.900
 And it's only when they don't have much food left.

00:45:27.900 --> 00:45:28.660
 Oh, yeah.

00:45:28.660 --> 00:45:29.660
 It eats food.

00:45:29.660 --> 00:45:31.980
 You wouldn't-- yeah, if you have a pizza in the freezer,

00:45:31.980 --> 00:45:35.620
 you're not going to go straight for that too, right?

00:45:35.620 --> 00:45:38.220
 That's pretty much their attitude.

00:45:38.220 --> 00:45:40.780
 But it does seem to help them stay alive for an extra few days

00:45:40.780 --> 00:45:41.820
 in times of one.

00:45:41.820 --> 00:45:44.140
 The mum, though, you say that she's very caring.

00:45:44.140 --> 00:45:45.700
 And absolutely, that's right.

00:45:45.700 --> 00:45:49.380
 But she does do an interesting survival of the fittest thing,

00:45:49.380 --> 00:45:51.300
 whereby the mothers have the ability

00:45:51.300 --> 00:45:56.100
 to smell out who the healthier of their offspring are.

00:45:56.100 --> 00:45:58.740
 It's a chemical smell that comes off the offspring

00:45:58.740 --> 00:45:59.460
 that they can smell.

00:45:59.460 --> 00:46:00.660
 And so once they've identified--

00:46:00.660 --> 00:46:04.260
 because they have such a big collection of babies,

00:46:04.260 --> 00:46:07.100
 it's something like up to 60, I think I read.

00:46:07.100 --> 00:46:08.940
 30 to 60 at a time.

00:46:08.940 --> 00:46:11.060
 So they need to make sure that the healthy ones

00:46:11.060 --> 00:46:11.980
 are the ones that survive.

00:46:11.980 --> 00:46:13.380
 So they smell them out.

00:46:13.380 --> 00:46:14.660
 And once they know which ones they are,

00:46:14.660 --> 00:46:18.260
 they'll give them more shit to eat just to make them healthier.

00:46:18.260 --> 00:46:22.220
 And they'll pay less attention to the less healthy ones.

00:46:22.220 --> 00:46:23.540
 Yeah.

00:46:23.540 --> 00:46:24.300
 Ouch.

00:46:24.300 --> 00:46:26.020
 So yeah, survival of the fittest.

00:46:26.020 --> 00:46:28.540
 Good mums, but also very, very disciplined.

00:46:28.540 --> 00:46:30.740
 Mm-hmm.

00:46:30.740 --> 00:46:35.340
 This fight was about the names of earwigs and what people call them.

00:46:35.340 --> 00:46:39.500
 In different countries, they have really weird synonyms.

00:46:39.500 --> 00:46:40.820
 I don't know if synonyms are right words.

00:46:40.820 --> 00:46:43.340
 So like the manks word in the Isle of Man,

00:46:43.340 --> 00:46:46.820
 their word for earwig is the same as their word for a dung fork.

00:46:46.820 --> 00:46:47.820
 A dung fork?

00:46:47.820 --> 00:46:48.820
 A dung fork.

00:46:48.820 --> 00:46:50.460
 You know like a pitchfork that you use to pick up dung

00:46:50.460 --> 00:46:51.940
 and then move it from one part of the farm

00:46:51.940 --> 00:46:53.020
 to the other part of the farm?

00:46:53.020 --> 00:46:54.020
 Oh, yeah, yeah.

00:46:54.020 --> 00:46:55.460
 So just a dung fork.

00:46:55.460 --> 00:46:58.500
 Is that what the earwigs use to eat their siblings' feces as well?

00:46:58.500 --> 00:47:04.540
 In Scotch, Gaelic, the word for earwig is the same as the word

00:47:04.540 --> 00:47:07.500
 for having your mouth so full that your cheeks puff out.

00:47:07.500 --> 00:47:08.500
 What?

00:47:08.500 --> 00:47:09.500
 I don't know.

00:47:09.500 --> 00:47:10.500
 I don't know.

00:47:10.500 --> 00:47:11.500
 It's so weird.

00:47:11.500 --> 00:47:14.660
 The Greek word for earwigs is the same as the word for alligator

00:47:14.660 --> 00:47:16.780
 and pruning scissors.

00:47:16.780 --> 00:47:21.180
 The Hungarian word for earwigs is the same for a catchy song.

00:47:21.180 --> 00:47:22.180
 Like an earwag.

00:47:22.180 --> 00:47:23.180
 Oh, an earwag.

00:47:23.180 --> 00:47:24.180
 An earwag.

00:47:24.180 --> 00:47:27.620
 In German, it's an oven, I think, in earwigs as well.

00:47:27.620 --> 00:47:29.180
 So that must be a link between those two.

00:47:29.180 --> 00:47:30.180
 Yeah, okay.

00:47:30.180 --> 00:47:32.700
 It makes me think that it must have been very confusing and greets.

00:47:32.700 --> 00:47:35.540
 If you said to somebody, could you please go and fetch my pruning scissors

00:47:35.540 --> 00:47:37.540
 there in the second drawer down in my bedroom?

00:47:37.540 --> 00:47:39.060
 Come back with an alligator.

00:47:39.060 --> 00:47:40.780
 Are you come back with an alligator, sir?

00:47:40.780 --> 00:47:43.820
 I mean, it's a dangerous game.

00:47:43.820 --> 00:47:47.580
 In Spanish, the word for earwigs is same as for an overhead kick and football.

00:47:47.580 --> 00:47:48.580
 Oh, cool.

00:47:48.580 --> 00:47:49.580
 Wow.

00:47:49.580 --> 00:47:50.580
 So weird.

00:47:50.580 --> 00:47:51.580
 Yeah.

00:47:51.580 --> 00:47:52.580
 Oh, wait.

00:47:52.580 --> 00:47:53.580
 I have a theory about why that one might be.

00:47:53.580 --> 00:47:54.580
 Oh, what?

00:47:54.580 --> 00:47:55.580
 It's a pretty tenuous theory.

00:47:55.580 --> 00:48:01.180
 But when earwigs are mating, they have a really complicated sort of dance they do,

00:48:01.180 --> 00:48:02.180
 getting to know each other.

00:48:02.180 --> 00:48:04.380
 And I think they smell each other.

00:48:04.380 --> 00:48:07.660
 And the male might do a little bit of flexing to show off.

00:48:07.660 --> 00:48:10.380
 And the female nibbles his forceps.

00:48:10.380 --> 00:48:14.620
 And after about ten minutes, she will raise up her abdomen at the back, right?

00:48:14.620 --> 00:48:20.260
 And then the male has to twist his abdomen 180 degrees left to right.

00:48:20.260 --> 00:48:22.060
 So his bum is upside down, basically.

00:48:22.060 --> 00:48:23.620
 And that means that it's facing upwards.

00:48:23.620 --> 00:48:26.580
 And that means that he can couple with her.

00:48:26.580 --> 00:48:28.900
 And then they spend several hours having sex.

00:48:28.900 --> 00:48:35.060
 But that flexibility of the abdomen might be why the bicycle kick has the same name as

00:48:35.060 --> 00:48:36.060
 the earwigs.

00:48:36.060 --> 00:48:37.060
 It could help it.

00:48:37.060 --> 00:48:38.060
 It could help it.

00:48:38.060 --> 00:48:41.860
 So can you tell me why the Ukrainian word for earwigs is the same as their word for

00:48:41.860 --> 00:48:42.860
 pimp?

00:48:42.860 --> 00:48:43.860
 Well.

00:48:43.860 --> 00:48:49.940
 Again, it's to do with turning your bum 180 degrees.

00:48:49.940 --> 00:48:55.660
 Okay, that is it.

00:48:55.660 --> 00:48:56.660
 That is all of our facts.

00:48:56.660 --> 00:48:58.140
 Thank you so much for listening.

00:48:58.140 --> 00:49:00.940

 We have all of our previous episodes up there, and links to little bits of merchandise that

00:49:21.580 --> 00:49:23.140
 we've released over the years.

00:49:23.140 --> 00:49:25.300
