00:00:00,00:00:06,"Oh no, they're not gonna wake me up."
00:00:06,00:00:10,"Oh no, they're not gonna wake me up."
00:00:10,00:00:19,"Hello and welcome to another episode of No Such Thing as a Fish, a weekly podcast coming"
00:00:19,00:00:23,to you from four undisclosed locations in the UK.
00:00:23,00:00:24,My name is Dan Schreiber.
00:00:24,00:00:29,"I am sitting here with Andrew Hunter Murray, James Harkin, and Anna Tajinsky, and once"
00:00:29,00:00:33,"again, we have gathered around the microphones with our four favorite facts from the last"
00:00:33,00:00:37,"seven days, and in a particular order, here we go."
00:00:37,00:00:39,"Starting with you, Andy."
00:00:39,00:00:44,My fact is that Paris's first public transport system failed because wealthy passengers bought
00:00:44,00:00:48,all the seats for themselves and then persuaded the government to ban poor people.
00:00:48,00:00:49,Wow.
00:00:49,00:00:50,Incredible.
00:00:50,00:00:56,"But if they were selling all the tickets, surely that's not a failure."
00:00:56,00:01:00,"Well, then the rich apparently does lost interest and then stopped using it, and then no one"
00:01:00,00:01:01,was using it.
00:01:01,00:01:03,So it was a complete disaster.
00:01:03,00:01:07,"This is from an article on Lapham's Quarterly, which is an amazing website."
00:01:07,00:01:08,It's really brilliant.
00:01:08,00:01:12,"It's got so many fascinating things on it, and it's partly based on this brilliant sounding"
00:01:12,00:01:17,"book about buses, which is called ""Engine of Modernity"" by Masha Belenky."
00:01:17,00:01:21,"Andy, have you already moved on from Fennicular Railways then?"
00:01:21,00:01:25,I'm afraid so.
00:01:25,00:01:34,"So this was called The Carrots, and it was set up by Blaise Pascal."
00:01:34,00:01:37,So we briefly actually mentioned before that Blaise Pascal set up the first public transport
00:01:37,00:01:40,"system in Paris, but I didn't know what happened to it."
00:01:40,00:01:44,"And it was basically a carriage with eight passengers and two staff, and they were rude."
00:01:44,00:01:45,"I'm sorry, when was it?"
00:01:45,00:01:46,Did you say?
00:01:46,00:01:47,"Oh, I'm sorry."
00:01:47,00:01:48,It was in 1662.
00:01:48,00:01:50,And who was Blaise Pascal again?
00:01:50,00:01:57,"He was a thinker, mathematician, probability dude, and what's Paris again?"
00:01:57,00:02:01,"I'm sorry, who were you?"
00:02:01,00:02:06,"Anyway, the point is, wealthy riders didn't like sharing with poor people."
00:02:06,00:02:11,"I think they weren't even, I think, really poor people were not even allowed on in the first"
00:02:11,00:02:12,place.
00:02:12,00:02:15,So I think wealthy people didn't like even sharing with the middle classes.
00:02:15,00:02:18,And so they would buy up all the seats in the carriage for themselves.
00:02:18,00:02:21,"And it lasted, I think, a few weeks."
00:02:21,00:02:26,"It was this really weird attempt to set up public transport, which didn't work because social"
00:02:26,00:02:27,hierarchy just got in line.
00:02:27,00:02:31,"Oh, I think it lasted a bit longer than that, because they had quite a few different routes"
00:02:31,00:02:32,by the end.
00:02:32,00:02:33,So they started off.
00:02:33,00:02:34,It was Blaise Pascal.
00:02:34,00:02:40,"He put the money in, along with a few other people, including the Duke of Roane."
00:02:40,00:02:48,"And the first route went from Pascal's house to the Duke of Roane's house, just by coincidence."
00:02:48,00:02:51,"And it went through the centre of Paris, but it did pick people up on the way."
00:02:51,00:02:55,"And then they, I think they had three or four other lines, and then they even had a circle"
00:02:55,00:02:57,line that connected all of them.
00:02:57,00:03:04,"And it was carried on going even after Pascal died, but once he died, it kind of went off."
00:03:04,00:03:11,"And they banned, the government banned soldiers and pages and other kind of livery to people"
00:03:11,00:03:12,in uniform kind of people.
00:03:12,00:03:16,"And when they banned those, everyone rioted against it, and that's kind of when it all"
00:03:16,00:03:18,fell out of favour.
00:03:18,00:03:23,"So this is what I did, because I read that, and I didn't quite understand why people wanted"
00:03:23,00:03:24,men in uniform banned.
00:03:24,00:03:27,"Well, they were the middle class, basically."
00:03:27,00:03:32,"A men in uniform would be not the working class, but not the, not the post shows."
00:03:32,00:03:36,"They'd be the in between people that you didn't really want to, want to mix with."
00:03:36,00:03:37,Right.
00:03:37,00:03:39,"So they had, they had a fashion ban on the bus, then, right?"
00:03:39,00:03:46,"Did they have people, was it the doctor's job, or the bus driver's job to go, ""I'm sorry,"
00:03:46,00:03:48,"you don't look good enough for my bus."""
00:03:48,00:03:51,"Or did you have to provide more concrete evidence, because you can be quite a good looking"
00:03:51,00:03:52,tailor.
00:03:52,00:03:56,"Surely you had to provide your CV, or maybe some really references from the former boys"
00:03:56,00:03:58,"or something, and it was to get on the bus."
00:03:58,00:04:01,"I don't really know how they managed to police it, to be honest."
00:04:01,00:04:02,I suppose.
00:04:02,00:04:08,"I suppose that the other, the other posh people on the bus would go, ""That man is a livery"
00:04:08,00:04:09,"man."""
00:04:09,00:04:12,"Yeah, livery is pretty easy to spot."
00:04:12,00:04:13,Yeah.
00:04:13,00:04:16,"You could, you know what livery is when you say, ""There was actually, I do know one thing"
00:04:16,00:04:20,"about how it was police, which is that you could be whipped if you interfered with the operations"
00:04:20,00:04:21,"of the bus."""
00:04:21,00:04:22,Wow.
00:04:22,00:04:23,Oh.
00:04:23,00:04:24,Yeah.
00:04:24,00:04:25,"Quite right, too."
00:04:25,00:04:26,"I mean, you could still be arrested."
00:04:26,00:04:29,"I think if you try to interfere with the operations of a public bus today, if you climb onto"
00:04:29,00:04:32,"the driver's lap and take control of the wheel, you are in trouble."
00:04:32,00:04:33,That's true.
00:04:33,00:04:37,And there probably is still some sort of fashion laws with modern-day London buses.
00:04:37,00:04:43,"Like, if I went on nude, that might be seen as worthy of not allowing me on."
00:04:43,00:04:44,True.
00:04:44,00:04:45,Yeah.
00:04:45,00:04:48,I just don't know it.
00:04:48,00:04:52,"And this really did sort of fall by the wayside, the idea of public transport for a long time,"
00:04:52,00:04:53,didn't it?
00:04:53,00:04:56,"So obviously you could get coaches and you could, you could hire lots if you could hire a"
00:04:56,00:05:01,"private coach or get on a post-chase or whatever, but the idea that a bus would have a specific"
00:05:01,00:05:05,route and you knew when it was going to be wet and you could wait there and pick it up.
00:05:05,00:05:10,"Then didn't come back until 1828, I think, in Europe and in Nantes."
00:05:10,00:05:13,"That's a long gap between buses, isn't it?"
00:05:13,00:05:14,Yeah.
00:05:14,00:05:21,"If you just missed the last one in the 1690s and you're like, OK, I'll wait for the next one."
00:05:21,00:05:22,It's there on the schedule.
00:05:22,00:05:23,What?
00:05:23,00:05:24,Wait?
00:05:24,00:05:25,"Oh, it's fine."
00:05:25,00:05:26,1828.
00:05:26,00:05:27,It's only 1747 now.
00:05:27,00:05:28,That's fine.
00:05:28,00:05:30,"No, it's not the clock."
00:05:30,00:05:32,"1828, too, suddenly came at once."
00:05:32,00:05:35,It was the classic.
00:05:35,00:05:37,But he didn't even want it to be a public transport system.
00:05:37,00:05:38,"Really, did he?"
00:05:38,00:05:43,This was a guy called Stanislas Bordry and he had a bathhouse and he basically just
00:05:43,00:05:48,wanted to get people to his bathhouse and so he put on a public bus in order to transport
00:05:48,00:05:51,"them there and he realised people were getting on it, but they're not getting in the bath"
00:05:51,00:05:52,at the end.
00:05:52,00:05:58,"That would be quite useful for your new bus drives, Stan, you have to get changed when"
00:05:58,00:06:01,you get to the bathhouse.
00:06:01,00:06:06,It would be amazing if you could get a bus which was going to the swimming pool and
00:06:06,00:06:09,the bus just ended up in the swimming pool and you could just swim out.
00:06:09,00:06:10,"Oh, like a piece."
00:06:10,00:06:11,You know what I mean?
00:06:11,00:06:17,It just goes in and then the bus goes out of the ramp or the swimmers who finish get off.
00:06:17,00:06:21,"Like in the Italian job, is it where there's a bus kind of gets to the edge of the cliff"
00:06:21,00:06:25,at the end and you could kind of jump off the bus and dive into the water?
00:06:25,00:06:26,That's quite cool.
00:06:26,00:06:27,Yeah.
00:06:27,00:06:30,"You need to have people, have you seen that movie James?"
00:06:30,00:06:33,Have I fuck?
00:06:33,00:06:41,"You should write a book about films because you are knowledgeable, but you've seen"
00:06:41,00:06:42,none of them.
00:06:42,00:06:43,It's great.
00:06:43,00:06:48,"The 19th century buses, when they came back, they were the first ones that had an upper deck,"
00:06:48,00:06:49,which was really cool.
00:06:49,00:06:54,"So the upper deck, you could go there for half price, but only if you were a man, they wouldn't"
00:06:54,00:07:00,let women go up there and the reason was because it was deemed unbecoming for a woman
00:07:00,00:07:03,to go up there in the big skirts that they were wearing and even actually impossible because
00:07:03,00:07:08,it was like a ladder to get to the top deck and also because it was completely in the open.
00:07:08,00:07:12,"So most of the time you just get drenched by rain or wind or whatever, so it was deemed"
00:07:12,00:07:14,unbecoming for women to get drenched.
00:07:14,00:07:17,"Is that because if someone's following you up the stairs, they see up your dress to your"
00:07:17,00:07:18,panties?
00:07:18,00:07:23,"Well, that might have been some of that in there because actually when they brought the"
00:07:23,00:07:29,"public transport into France the second time, it kind of became a thing where it was giving"
00:07:29,00:07:36,women more chance to move around and it was associated with like transgression in women.
00:07:36,00:07:40,"Like a lot of whenever any kind of freedom got given to women in history, like people thought,"
00:07:40,00:07:42,"""Oh, this must be a terrible thing."""
00:07:42,00:07:47,"Yeah, but as James is saying as well, there's a suggestion, which I think is a very, it's"
00:07:47,00:07:52,"a more jokey suggestion that the skirts, the frames of those giant hoop skirts would be"
00:07:52,00:07:55,so large they physically couldn't fit them.
00:07:55,00:08:00,"They would get stuck on the way up, but yeah, but as a result, it became quite a social"
00:08:00,00:08:05,"place, the bus and there was sort of known bus perverts who would sort of just hang out"
00:08:05,00:08:07,just so that they could be around all these women.
00:08:07,00:08:12,"I'm so worried, Dan, that you've alighted immediately that it became quite a social place"
00:08:12,00:08:14,and there were these bus perverts.
00:08:14,00:08:19,"So that's the definition of a social place is if you've got a good pervert there, holding"
00:08:19,00:08:20,court.
00:08:20,00:08:29,"I mean, it led to bus pervertism where you would have guys would just spend the whole day"
00:08:29,00:08:35,"on the bus and if another lady came on, they would sit next to her or be squashed up next"
00:08:35,00:08:42,"to someone, it was the perfect way for the pervert to suddenly have access to a bunch of women,"
00:08:42,00:08:43,which was a big problem.
00:08:43,00:08:47,"Not saying it is a good thing, guys, but the bad buses are quite sociable."
00:08:47,00:08:48,Now aren't they?
00:08:48,00:08:49,"The Venger bus, for instance."
00:08:49,00:08:50,Yeah.
00:08:50,00:08:53,"The bus, the bus is Spice World the movie."
00:08:53,00:08:54,They all had a pervert.
00:08:54,00:08:59,"The acquaintance with buses is from film, even though you don't watch film."
00:08:59,00:09:02,"I just think it is a social thing, the bus, isn't it?"
00:09:02,00:09:03,True.
00:09:03,00:09:05,Have you seen Spice World the movie?
00:09:05,00:09:07,"No, I obviously haven't seen Spice World the movie."
00:09:07,00:09:10,"I haven't either, but it's got Richard E. Grant, isn't it?"
00:09:10,00:09:11,He's the bus driver.
00:09:11,00:09:12,He's the manager.
00:09:12,00:09:13,Yeah.
00:09:13,00:09:15,"Oh, yeah, but does he also drive the bus?"
00:09:15,00:09:17,"I think at what point he does drive the bus, yeah."
00:09:17,00:09:18,Okay.
00:09:18,00:09:23,"So does Victoria Beckham, but I don't call her the bus driver in the movie."
00:09:23,00:09:25,"Summer holiday with Cliff Richard, that I had a bus in it."
00:09:25,00:09:26,Yep.
00:09:26,00:09:27,Yeah.
00:09:27,00:09:30,I think the Spice World won a Stanley clear coach by the definitions we're running by.
00:09:30,00:09:32,It's not like anyone could board.
00:09:32,00:09:36,"It's not that Spice Girls paid their 180 fat, got on, and there's lots of other people"
00:09:36,00:09:37,got on and off.
00:09:37,00:09:41,"Didn't the Spice Girls buy out all the seats in that bus, so no one else could get on it?"
00:09:41,00:09:42,Yeah.
00:09:42,00:09:43,That's right.
00:09:43,00:09:46,Imagine how long it would take to tour the country if all the buses taking the
00:09:46,00:09:50,bans around with public buses.
00:09:50,00:09:55,"We got three hours to get there, but we've got 40 stops along the way."
00:09:55,00:09:58,"Can I tell you guys a personal, something personal?"
00:09:58,00:09:59,Yeah.
00:09:59,00:10:00,"Oh, boy."
00:10:00,00:10:05,I was recently reading an old copy of the Pickwick Papers that I found.
00:10:05,00:10:06,I think my parents asked ages ago.
00:10:06,00:10:09,"Well, no, I think I inherited it from my grandma."
00:10:09,00:10:15,"Anyway, I opened it to one page, and there was a bus ticket in there, or a tram ticket, sorry."
00:10:15,00:10:16,It's just a scrap of tram ticket.
00:10:16,00:10:22,"It's from London United tramways, so I looked that up, and that ran from 1894 to 1933."
00:10:22,00:10:27,And it's punched for a journey in the sort of Wimbledon Kingston area.
00:10:27,00:10:28,And it says it costs two pennies.
00:10:28,00:10:30,It was 2D.
00:10:30,00:10:31,And isn't that cool?
00:10:31,00:10:32,And I don't know who owned it.
00:10:32,00:10:37,"And I looked at that one, like, looking up the, when the ticket was from, when those stops"
00:10:37,00:10:39,"existed, and also the advert on the other side."
00:10:39,00:10:44,"So on the other side, there's an advert for Holloway's magic ointment, or Holloway's"
00:10:44,00:10:45,all-rounder ointment.
00:10:45,00:10:46,Okay.
00:10:46,00:10:47,I think it's from 1900.
00:10:47,00:10:48,Wow.
00:10:48,00:10:49,What does this ointment do?
00:10:49,00:10:51,That's what I'm getting from the story.
00:10:51,00:10:53,"It cures absolutely everything, James."
00:10:53,00:10:54,It's an all-round remedy.
00:10:54,00:11:00,"It's literally said, backache, heart attacks, brain disease, vomiting."
00:11:00,00:11:01,It's all there.
00:11:01,00:11:04,"Actually, then I went on a stupid rabbit hole that was made by a guy called Thomas Holloway,"
00:11:04,00:11:06,and it made him super rich.
00:11:06,00:11:13,"And so he bought this mansion called Tittonhurst Park, and that, Dan, you do recognise it."
00:11:13,00:11:15,Why do you recognise it?
00:11:15,00:11:16,The Beatles?
00:11:16,00:11:17,Yeah.
00:11:17,00:11:19,Apparently John Lennon lived there a hundred years after him.
00:11:19,00:11:20,"Yeah, wow."
00:11:20,00:11:26,So that was a convoluted way that I got to John Lennon via this fact.
00:11:26,00:11:27,"But anyway, isn't that cool?"
00:11:27,00:11:29,I've got a bus ticket from 120 years ago.
00:11:29,00:11:30,That is very cool.
00:11:30,00:11:31,I think so.
00:11:31,00:11:34,"Do you know, can I give a quick personal story?"
00:11:34,00:11:40,"When I went to Zanzibar on Honeymoon, suddenly coming up next, did you find a bus ticket"
00:11:40,00:11:45,that used to belong to Freddie Mercury or something?
00:11:45,00:11:52,"No, next to me is Anna's grandmother driving a bus, I just couldn't believe it."
00:11:52,00:11:57,"Next to me is a bus that I used to get, not obviously the exact bus, but a bus that I"
00:11:57,00:12:00,used to get in Hong Kong as a kid.
00:12:00,00:12:04,And I suddenly looked around and all the buses in Zanzibar were the old buses from Hong
00:12:04,00:12:06,"Kong, from my childhood."
00:12:06,00:12:07,Wow.
00:12:07,00:12:11,"And I think when buses are put out of, you know, when new buses come in to say London"
00:12:11,00:12:14,"or whatever, they shift out all these buses to all these different countries."
00:12:14,00:12:15,Yeah.
00:12:15,00:12:16,And Zanzibar.
00:12:16,00:12:17,That is awesome.
00:12:17,00:12:19,"All the old London buses went to Macau, I think."
00:12:19,00:12:22,"So if you, they might not be there anymore, about 10 years ago, if you went on a bus in"
00:12:22,00:12:24,"Macau, they were old London buses."
00:12:24,00:12:25,Wow.
00:12:25,00:12:30,"And the Bendy buses, I think we've said before, they went somewhere super inappropriate."
00:12:30,00:12:31,Yeah.
00:12:31,00:12:37,"I don't mean like they went to a sex club, but I mean they went to a place where they were"
00:12:37,00:12:46,at the bus.
00:12:46,00:12:52,Can I quickly tell you the most desperate ever press release I found about buses?
00:12:52,00:12:53,Okay.
00:12:53,00:12:57,This was at the time the James Bond film Spectre was coming out.
00:12:57,00:13:00,"The press releases by National Express, the bus company."
00:13:00,00:13:04,"So often sophisticated James Bond is unquestionably one of the most glamorous characters of all time,"
00:13:04,00:13:09,but was the world's most famous by named after a humble bus?
00:13:09,00:13:12,It's a question National Express hopes to answer once and for all.
00:13:12,00:13:15,We know where he got his name James Bond.
00:13:15,00:13:16,I know.
00:13:16,00:13:17,I know.
00:13:17,00:13:19,"But the 007 bit, I mean."
00:13:19,00:13:20,"Oh, right."
00:13:20,00:13:21,Okay.
00:13:21,00:13:22,"Sorry, yeah."
00:13:22,00:13:25,"The National Express 007 coach service, which was formerly a bus route when it was taken"
00:13:25,00:13:29,"over in 1973, operates nine times daily between Deal and Victoria."
00:13:29,00:13:34,It has rumored Bond author Fleming was inspired by the destination blind of his local bus to adopt
00:13:34,00:13:38,the number and they go on and on and on about it.
00:13:38,00:13:42,"And they even got a National Express driver to say, well, James Bond is more likely to be"
00:13:42,00:13:44,seen behind the wheel of a Bentley.
00:13:44,00:13:48,It's a massive honor to drive the 007 and it certainly attracts a lot of attention.
00:13:48,00:13:50,It's always a talking point.
00:13:50,00:13:55,"You see heads turning by as you go by and people pointing, they're definitely more passengers"
00:13:55,00:13:57,"recently, perhaps because of the new film."
00:13:57,00:13:59,I would have thought that's definitely the case.
00:13:59,00:14:12,It turns out that the National Numbering Scheme wasn't actually introduced until the mid-1970s.
00:14:12,00:14:13,Okay.
00:14:13,00:14:16,It is time for fact number two and that is Anna.
00:14:16,00:14:21,My fact this week is that Aladdin is Chinese.
00:14:21,00:14:22,What?
00:14:22,00:14:35,"Are you doing your own life for the fact now, Anna?"
00:14:35,00:14:36,Thank you.
00:14:36,00:14:37,I know.
00:14:37,00:14:38,Right.
00:14:38,00:14:43,"So I decided I wanted to read Aladdin, so I read about this new translation."
00:14:43,00:14:48,"So I bought it recently, opened it and the very first line of the story."
00:14:48,00:14:50,No bus tickets in there.
00:14:50,00:14:53,One way to get on a budget carpet.
00:14:53,00:14:57,"It's a bus ticket from Shanghai, which is how I knew."
00:14:57,00:15:01,The first line is in one of China's vast and wealthy kingdoms.
00:15:01,00:15:03,I thought this is a shit translation.
00:15:03,00:15:07,"They've got the bloody country wrong, first sentence."
00:15:07,00:15:10,But turns out it's bang on and he was from China.
00:15:10,00:15:16,"And so the whole story behind Aladdin and the 2001 Arabian Knights, which is what it's"
00:15:16,00:15:22,"a part of, is kind of an amazing story of tales being passed from one country to the next."
00:15:22,00:15:28,So basically it was written down for the first time by a French guy called Antoine Galon.
00:15:28,00:15:31,And this is in the very early 1700s.
00:15:31,00:15:35,"And he'd been told it by a Syrian who he'd met, a guy from Aleppo."
00:15:35,00:15:37,And the Syrian had told it as him being a Chinese person.
00:15:37,00:15:41,"So it was told in Arabia, but Aladdin was Chinese."
00:15:41,00:15:45,"And it was just this thing where whenever something is kind of exotic or foreign, we go"
00:15:45,00:15:46,east.
00:15:46,00:15:49,We seem to just go east when we're telling a story as an exotic or foreign.
00:15:49,00:15:53,"So if you were in Persia, then you wanted to convey that something was like exotic or"
00:15:53,00:15:56,"a bit strange, you put it in China, set it in China."
00:15:56,00:16:03,"And I don't know what you do in Chinese, set it in Japan, yeah, Japan, Alaska."
00:16:03,00:16:04,Is his name Aladdin then?
00:16:04,00:16:06,Because that's not a very Chinese name.
00:16:06,00:16:08,"No, this is the weird thing about it."
00:16:08,00:16:11,The details are quite Arabic.
00:16:11,00:16:16,"So they didn't read no much about actual China, but they were just setting it in China."
00:16:16,00:16:19,"So throughout the story, you'll read, you know, he was in one of these classic Chinese"
00:16:19,00:16:20,palaces.
00:16:20,00:16:23,And then they'll describe the palace and it'll be a combination of an Arabian palace with
00:16:23,00:16:26,some French influence because it was written down by a French guy.
00:16:26,00:16:29,Was there a theory that Galon had invented it himself as well?
00:16:29,00:16:34,"Because it took a long time to track down the Syrian who, it's a monk who had told him"
00:16:34,00:16:35,the story.
00:16:35,00:16:37,"Yeah, this is also amazing."
00:16:37,00:16:38,Yeah.
00:16:38,00:16:42,"I love that this was, this mystery was solved sort of hundreds of years later."
00:16:42,00:16:48,"So yeah, Galon said that he'd, he wrote down a thousand and one nights, the Arabic stories."
00:16:48,00:16:50,And then people were clamoring for more.
00:16:50,00:16:54,And so he wrote down some more stories that weren't in the original Arabic version he
00:16:54,00:16:55,was translating.
00:16:55,00:16:57,And he said that he'd been told them by this Syrian guy.
00:16:57,00:17:02,But everyone sort of assumed he'd just made them up and then given them this origin story
00:17:02,00:17:03,from Syria.
00:17:03,00:17:08,And then they found the autobiography of the Syrian guy who's called Hannah Diab.
00:17:08,00:17:12,"They found the autobiography in 1993, isn't it, which I just, it's how incredible is that"
00:17:12,00:17:15,sort of 280 years later?
00:17:15,00:17:19,"Does he say it is autobiography, met a French guy today and told him this brilliant story"
00:17:19,00:17:20,about a Chinese guy in the lab?
00:17:20,00:17:22,"He does, he mentions it."
00:17:22,00:17:25,"He does, he mentions it in his memoirs."
00:17:25,00:17:30,"And there is a theory now, a new theory which is that the story of Aladdin might be an"
00:17:30,00:17:32,autobiography of this guy called Diab.
00:17:32,00:17:37,And he's talking about when he arrived in Paris because he arrived in Versailles and they
00:17:37,00:17:39,had all these wonderful things.
00:17:39,00:17:43,And Aladdin is obviously the story of a young boy who kind of gets lots of riches and
00:17:43,00:17:44,stuff.
00:17:44,00:17:49,And so it might have been him kind of turning his experiences into an Arabic story.
00:17:49,00:17:50,Wow.
00:17:50,00:17:52,"Well, definitely influenced by his time in France anyway."
00:17:52,00:17:56,"Because yeah, when Aladdin magics is palessed out of nothing, it's very much Versailles"
00:17:56,00:17:57,influenced.
00:17:57,00:18:02,"It's pretty amazing that this was a very famous text for its time, right?"
00:18:02,00:18:03,The Arabian Nights.
00:18:03,00:18:05,And then this guy comes along.
00:18:05,00:18:11,"He adds not only probably the most famous story, which is Aladdin, but he also adds the story"
00:18:11,00:18:13,of Ali Barba and the 40 Thieves.
00:18:13,00:18:19,"He adds the seven voyages of Simbad, the sailor, the three most famous stories probably had"
00:18:19,00:18:20,nothing to do with the original.
00:18:20,00:18:21,It's fanfiction.
00:18:21,00:18:22,Yeah.
00:18:22,00:18:26,He added to a book which has suddenly overtaken the book.
00:18:26,00:18:29,"Yeah, he was, it wasn't that famous when he was translating it, was it?"
00:18:29,00:18:30,I don't think.
00:18:30,00:18:33,And he was kind of the one who made it famous.
00:18:33,00:18:37,"And the problem was like Europe, yeah, yeah, sorry, in Europe for sure."
00:18:37,00:18:40,"But like I kind of said, people wanted more."
00:18:40,00:18:43,"And so his publishers just started going, oh, we'll just write some more, then put them"
00:18:43,00:18:44,in your name.
00:18:44,00:18:49,So they started taking other stories from Turkey and from other parts of Eastern Europe
00:18:49,00:18:53,"and then putting them in as part of the 1,001 Nights."
00:18:53,00:18:56,"And he's like, no, no, wait, no, don't put those shit ones in."
00:18:56,00:18:57,I'll give you some more.
00:18:57,00:18:58,I'll give you some more.
00:18:58,00:19:00,Like these new ones like Symbad and Aladdin came from.
00:19:00,00:19:02,That's a good way to threaten an author.
00:19:02,00:19:05,To threaten to write the sequel really badly.
00:19:05,00:19:06,That's true.
00:19:06,00:19:08,"They should do that with George R.R. Martin, shouldn't they?"
00:19:08,00:19:11,"They should say, we're just going to write the last Game of Thrones."
00:19:11,00:19:14,We're just going to get E.L. James to write it.
00:19:14,00:19:17,"He's like, no, no, no."
00:19:17,00:19:21,He also had his windows in Paris pelted with kind of rotten fruit and hard objects
00:19:21,00:19:23,by people who wanted more stories.
00:19:23,00:19:27,The reading public was much more demanding in those days.
00:19:27,00:19:30,"Imagine if I'd done that to Hillary Mantell for the last five years,"
00:19:30,00:19:34,just kind of attacking her with various missiles.
00:19:34,00:19:37,And it wouldn't induce you to want to satisfy your public by writing something.
00:19:37,00:19:38,But it did.
00:19:38,00:19:38,And he did.
00:19:38,00:19:42,"But the story that we all know, I would say,"
00:19:42,00:19:47,is as a result of the brilliant animated 1992 movie.
00:19:47,00:19:49,"I think we've all seen that, have we?"
00:19:49,00:19:50,Have we all seen that?
00:19:50,00:19:51,"Yeah, of course, yeah."
00:19:51,00:19:51,We've all seen that.
00:19:51,00:19:55,So I'm going to take very quiet over there.
00:19:55,00:20:01,"But yeah, so classic Hollywood distorted the facts of the story,"
00:20:01,00:20:03,bent them to be a different story altogether.
00:20:03,00:20:07,"So in it, Aladdin's not a Norfolk in the original story,"
00:20:07,00:20:08,which he's portrayed as in the movie.
00:20:08,00:20:09,He lives with his mum.
00:20:09,00:20:13,"And in the original story, it's not just one genie granting wishes."
00:20:13,00:20:15,It's two genies.
00:20:15,00:20:18,There's a genie of the lamp and there's a genie of the ring.
00:20:18,00:20:20,And then it's not three wishes.
00:20:20,00:20:21,"Like, he gets as many wishes."
00:20:21,00:20:23,He just keeps wishing away.
00:20:23,00:20:24,Is this having a wishing party?
00:20:24,00:20:26,Did he do that trick that everyone says they're going to do
00:20:26,00:20:29,when they're a kid where the first wish is infinite wishes?
00:20:29,00:20:30,Is that how he does it?
00:20:30,00:20:32,"Oh, yeah."
00:20:32,00:20:33,It's not allowed.
00:20:33,00:20:35,"The genie specifically bands that are in the Disney film,"
00:20:35,00:20:38,"which you wouldn't know if you had watched it, James."
00:20:38,00:20:40,I really thought that was the rest of it.
00:20:40,00:20:41,"That's so good that it's infinite, though."
00:20:41,00:20:43,I always thought it was a million.
00:20:43,00:20:45,How stupid would I have looked with you guys
00:20:45,00:20:46,as I got to my millionth wish?
00:20:46,00:20:49,You guys get to carry that one.
00:20:49,00:20:50,You could just use your millionth wish
00:20:50,00:20:52,to ask for another million wishes.
00:20:52,00:20:56,"I'm like, Jesus, what are you saying?"
00:20:56,00:20:58,Although you could have asked for a thousand and one
00:20:58,00:21:01,in Arabic because the reason it's a thousand and one
00:21:01,00:21:03,nights is actually because that was like an Arabic word
00:21:03,00:21:05,"for infinite, infinite stories."
00:21:05,00:21:06,It was meant to be.
00:21:06,00:21:09,"Yeah, because if they called it 270 nights, roughly,"
00:21:09,00:21:12,"it's not as impressive or sexy, is it?"
00:21:12,00:21:13,It's not.
00:21:13,00:21:15,"But also, no wonder the publishers wanted more stories."
00:21:15,00:21:19,This is nowhere near the number you've promised.
00:21:19,00:21:21,"Hey, the most striking thing about the story,"
00:21:21,00:21:23,"which, as I say, I have just read, and it is great,"
00:21:23,00:21:24,is Aladdin.
00:21:24,00:21:29,"It's a complete dickhead, like not a likable character at all."
00:21:29,00:21:31,So the reason his dad dies at the start
00:21:31,00:21:34,is because Aladdin is so lazy and greasy and dissipated
00:21:34,00:21:36,and cruel that his dad's just devastated
00:21:36,00:21:39,that he won't follow him in his career path.
00:21:39,00:21:41,"And basically, he just gets really lucky."
00:21:41,00:21:43,He gets sort of kidnapped by this bloke
00:21:43,00:21:45,who reveals all these riches to him.
00:21:45,00:21:49,"And then he manages to escape the bloke, the wizard."
00:21:49,00:21:52,And then just uses all the riches to seduce the princess.
00:21:52,00:21:54,He falls in love with the princess
00:21:54,00:21:57,because he hears that she's going to be going to the bath.
00:21:57,00:22:00,I don't know what number bath she wants to be.
00:22:00,00:22:01,At the time.
00:22:01,00:22:03,But he hears she's going to be going to the baths.
00:22:03,00:22:05,And so he sneaks in to spy on her
00:22:05,00:22:08,because he's never seen a woman unveiled before.
00:22:08,00:22:11,"She's her face from behind the door, really fancies her."
00:22:11,00:22:15,"And she's going to marry this guy who seems like a really decent bloke,"
00:22:15,00:22:19,"the viseous son. And Aladdin, just on their wedding night,"
00:22:19,00:22:21,"on the viseous and her wedding night,"
00:22:21,00:22:25,uses the lamp to magic their marriage bed into his own home.
00:22:25,00:22:27,And then he gets the viseous son out.
00:22:27,00:22:28,He sends him out to spend the whole night
00:22:28,00:22:31,in a freezing cold toilet outside
00:22:31,00:22:32,and then lies with the princess.
00:22:32,00:22:33,"Wow, that's how he seduced him."
00:22:33,00:22:35,"So that's why he's called Aladdin, isn't it?"
00:22:35,00:22:37,Because he's an absolute lad.
00:22:37,00:22:40,"That's the full name is an absolute lad in, yeah."
00:22:40,00:22:42,An absolute lad gets in there.
00:22:42,00:22:45,Yeah.
00:22:45,00:22:48,"So, Anna, you haven't been reading the Richard Burton one, right?"
00:22:48,00:22:51,"No, this is a new translation, which I would recommend"
00:22:51,00:22:54,"because it's by this woman called Yasmin Seal, who is French Syrian,"
00:22:54,00:22:56,which I just love because obviously it was an amalgamation
00:22:56,00:22:59,of French and Syrian when it was first written.
00:22:59,00:23:01,"But no, not that one."
00:23:01,00:23:02,Why?
00:23:02,00:23:04,"Because Richard Burton was the, Richard Burton"
00:23:04,00:23:06,the Victorian explorer and linguist.
00:23:06,00:23:08,He did all these amazing adventures.
00:23:08,00:23:10,He visited Mecca in disguise once.
00:23:10,00:23:12,And he would have been killed if he'd been discovered.
00:23:12,00:23:13,"You know, he was an amazing adventurer."
00:23:13,00:23:19,"But Burton wrote a really erotic translation of ""The Thousand of One Nights"""
00:23:19,00:23:21,because he also translated the calmasutra
00:23:21,00:23:26,and he was very sexy.
00:23:26,00:23:30,"Visor the bus pervert of his day, he was."
00:23:30,00:23:31,"But in his version of Aladdin,"
00:23:31,00:23:33,Aladdin's father is impotent.
00:23:33,00:23:37,And so he takes an opium-based medicine to thicken his semen.
00:23:37,00:23:38,Jesus.
00:23:38,00:23:40,That's just a detail of the story.
00:23:40,00:23:41,Cool.
00:23:41,00:23:44,"I think that's the Holloway's ointment of its day, isn't it?"
00:23:44,00:23:46,[LAUGHTER]
00:23:46,00:23:49,"Yeah, his version had to be privately printed, didn't it?"
00:23:49,00:23:50,It was--
00:23:50,00:23:51,"Yeah, I think it did."
00:23:51,00:23:52,--because of the sexual content.
00:23:52,00:23:54,"Yeah, you had to-- you couldn't buy it."
00:23:54,00:23:56,It was through subscription that you had to get it.
00:23:56,00:23:56,Wow.
00:23:56,00:23:57,Yeah.
00:23:57,00:23:59,"And I haven't seen the Disney film for a while,"
00:23:59,00:24:01,"but I'm pretty sure they didn't leave that element, did they?"
00:24:01,00:24:02,It's strongly implied.
00:24:02,00:24:06,[LAUGHTER]
00:24:06,00:24:09,"Yeah, he was a pretty crazy character at Richard Burton."
00:24:09,00:24:11,I'm never sure how I feel about him.
00:24:11,00:24:13,But he did like to sex things up.
00:24:13,00:24:16,I suppose he didn't need to sex up the kamasucha too much.
00:24:16,00:24:17,No.
00:24:17,00:24:18,He wrote his own-- I think most of what we know about him
00:24:18,00:24:20,"is from his own autobiography, and also"
00:24:20,00:24:22,the biography of his adoring wife.
00:24:22,00:24:25,And he claimed that he learned Latin fluently at the age of three
00:24:25,00:24:28,and Greek fluently at the age of four.
00:24:28,00:24:30,And he could play chess blindfolded.
00:24:30,00:24:32,And he-- but he was amazing.
00:24:32,00:24:34,He just sort of traveled everywhere.
00:24:34,00:24:37,"He ended up speaking 40 languages, got in loads of trouble."
00:24:37,00:24:40,I think he got-- he was a soldier in India.
00:24:40,00:24:43,"And he got kicked out of India, and his life as a soldier"
00:24:43,00:24:45,failed when his governor basically
00:24:45,00:24:47,asked him to investigate some rumors
00:24:47,00:24:49,that they'd heard about brothels in the city.
00:24:49,00:24:51,"And because he had an eye for detail,"
00:24:51,00:24:53,"especially a lascivious detail, he just"
00:24:53,00:24:56,investigated them way too hard.
00:24:56,00:24:59,"So he spent lots and lots of time in brothels,"
00:24:59,00:25:02,just taking meticulous notes about exactly what was going on.
00:25:02,00:25:05,"And the authorities were like, fuck, this is rank, Richard."
00:25:05,00:25:06,"Oh, go home."
00:25:06,00:25:08,You are sick.
00:25:08,00:25:10,And killed is grit.
00:25:10,00:25:13,Did you know that the queen has played Aladdin?
00:25:13,00:25:15,It was when she was-- it was during the war.
00:25:15,00:25:18,"During the war, Queen Elizabeth played Aladdin"
00:25:18,00:25:22,in the royal family's pantomime to raise money for soldiers.
00:25:22,00:25:25,I think they invited a small audience of aristocrats.
00:25:25,00:25:28,"And she would have been in her early teens, I guess, at the time."
00:25:28,00:25:29,Yeah.
00:25:29,00:25:32,"Queen-- her pre-queens, they call them in the royal family."
00:25:32,00:25:35,[LAUGHTER]
00:25:35,00:25:36,And was it with the others?
00:25:36,00:25:39,"And it was, like, Margaret-- the parents or Margaret?"
00:25:39,00:25:43,"Margaret was in it, but I don't think she was playing the parents."
00:25:43,00:25:47,"It's like when you're at school, when I was at school,"
00:25:47,00:25:50,"in the Nativity Play, when I was in the top,"
00:25:50,00:25:54,"yeah, I played Joseph, which was very nice."
00:25:54,00:25:55,The main part-- main role.
00:25:55,00:25:57,"Yeah, I don't know if you know that."
00:25:57,00:26:00,"Don't know if you know the Nativity story, but it's--"
00:26:00,00:26:01,He's a pretty big deal at it.
00:26:01,00:26:02,This is a pretty big one.
00:26:02,00:26:06,"My brother, in the same play, played a blade of grass."
00:26:06,00:26:07,[LAUGHTER]
00:26:07,00:26:10,Wow.
00:26:10,00:26:11,Wow.
00:26:11,00:26:12,Blade of grass.
00:26:12,00:26:14,They couldn't find a single bigger role
00:26:14,00:26:16,for him than a single blade of grass.
00:26:16,00:26:18,Not even a few blades of grass.
00:26:18,00:26:20,"No, there was a few different--"
00:26:20,00:26:23,"I don't think he was, like, head blade of grass."
00:26:23,00:26:26,And he didn't have a speaking role.
00:26:26,00:26:26,I'm just trying to--
00:26:26,00:26:28,He didn't understand any blade of grass.
00:26:28,00:26:32,There's no sentient grass in the story.
00:26:32,00:26:35,"But basically, you had the load of the kids"
00:26:35,00:26:38,would kind of stand there and kind of wave in the breeze
00:26:38,00:26:39,as if they were a blade of grass.
00:26:39,00:26:41,I don't remember any grass being mentioned
00:26:41,00:26:44,in any version of the negativity I've ever heard.
00:26:44,00:26:46,"Well, what did the donkey eat?"
00:26:46,00:26:48,I guess straw?
00:26:48,00:26:51,What straw if it's not dry grass?
00:26:51,00:26:52,"Yeah, fair enough."
00:26:52,00:26:54,So where's his role to be eaten by the donkey at some point?
00:26:54,00:26:58,[LAUGHTER]
00:26:58,00:27:01,"Oh, my goodness."
00:27:01,00:27:03,"OK, it is time for fact number three."
00:27:03,00:27:05,And that is my fact.
00:27:05,00:27:07,My fact this week is that merry grounds
00:27:07,00:27:12,were invented in medieval times for nights to ride on.
00:27:12,00:27:16,So this is carousels for any Americans listening.
00:27:16,00:27:19,The merry ground has a very long history.
00:27:19,00:27:21,It sort of originates back in the 12th century.
00:27:21,00:27:25,There was a game that was played on horseback
00:27:25,00:27:30,where a sort of scented ball used to be tossed around to people.
00:27:30,00:27:33,"And if you dropped it, or if it smashed on you,"
00:27:33,00:27:35,it would release a kind of perfume.
00:27:35,00:27:38,And that perfume would stink you up for the rest of the match.
00:27:38,00:27:42,"And that word was carouselo, which meant little war."
00:27:42,00:27:44,Carouselo is a sort of bastardization
00:27:44,00:27:47,of it by the Italians who took it on.
00:27:47,00:27:52,And then they realized how useful this was in combat training
00:27:52,00:27:52,purposes.
00:27:52,00:27:57,"And so little war, carouselo slowly"
00:27:57,00:28:01,morphed into nights sitting on what were effectively
00:28:01,00:28:02,saddles.
00:28:02,00:28:05,And they would go around a pole on chains.
00:28:05,00:28:09,And they would have to try and lance with their lances
00:28:09,00:28:10,a little ring.
00:28:10,00:28:12,And that was the very beginnings of what
00:28:12,00:28:14,eventually turned into what we now
00:28:14,00:28:16,have as the modern day carousel.
00:28:16,00:28:19,"So yeah, it was originally for night training."
00:28:19,00:28:22,So this game where you throw balls at people.
00:28:22,00:28:24,"And if you drop them, they make you"
00:28:24,00:28:27,smell like perfume.
00:28:27,00:28:29,What's the point in that?
00:28:29,00:28:33,I think it's really weird.
00:28:33,00:28:35,"Basically, if you smell like perfume,"
00:28:35,00:28:37,you smell quite nice.
00:28:37,00:28:39,And the other people will smell like they've been riding around
00:28:39,00:28:40,on a horse all afternoon.
00:28:40,00:28:41,They'll be sweaty and disgusting.
00:28:41,00:28:44,"And supposedly, there's perfume people of the losers."
00:28:44,00:28:45,I say they've won.
00:28:45,00:28:46,I agree.
00:28:46,00:28:47,Because I read about this as well.
00:28:47,00:28:49,And that was the one thing that stuck with me.
00:28:49,00:28:51,This seems like a pretty stupid--
00:28:51,00:28:53,a bit like Quidditch being a stupid game.
00:28:53,00:28:55,This is kind of a stupid game where it's not really
00:28:55,00:28:59,obvious what the point of winning or losing is.
00:28:59,00:29:00,I just didn't like it at all.
00:29:00,00:29:02,You wouldn't say that James about Quidditch
00:29:02,00:29:06,to the people who play Quidditch in the park near my house.
00:29:06,00:29:08,And they're not even flying.
00:29:08,00:29:10,Are they a scary looking bunch?
00:29:10,00:29:11,They've all got sticks.
00:29:11,00:29:12,That's true.
00:29:12,00:29:13,Although the sticks do have to be clamped
00:29:13,00:29:17,"between their legs, otherwise it's easy."
00:29:17,00:29:19,"I think it's the shame of it, right?"
00:29:19,00:29:21,So Andy could sit at the stinking of perfume
00:29:21,00:29:23,in the dining hall afterwards shrieking.
00:29:23,00:29:26,I've won in most senses at the word.
00:29:26,00:29:27,He likes.
00:29:27,00:29:30,"But in the end, everyone knows that you've lost."
00:29:30,00:29:30,That's true.
00:29:30,00:29:33,I suppose if you play an actual spot and then you
00:29:33,00:29:36,"go to the pub afterwards, you don't really know who's lost."
00:29:36,00:29:39,It's not obvious to everyone else in the pub who's lost.
00:29:39,00:29:40,But then everyone--
00:29:40,00:29:43,"As Anna points out, it is obvious."
00:29:43,00:29:44,"Because any time I finish playing sport,"
00:29:44,00:29:45,I'm the one who's lost.
00:29:45,00:29:51,"It's so early carousels, though."
00:29:51,00:29:53,"They were powered by animals walking in a circle,"
00:29:53,00:29:54,which I had no idea about.
00:29:54,00:29:56,"So instead of, as well as having a fake horse"
00:29:56,00:29:58,"that you'd be riding on, there would be a real horse."
00:29:58,00:30:01,Why don't you just get on the real horse?
00:30:01,00:30:05,"Like, if the whole point is to train how to ride horses,"
00:30:05,00:30:07,"and you've got an actual horse there,"
00:30:07,00:30:09,why are you sitting on the fake one?
00:30:09,00:30:10,"Yeah, it's true."
00:30:10,00:30:11,Very weird.
00:30:11,00:30:15,"Those horses-- I mean, that is so demeaning for those horses."
00:30:15,00:30:17,Imagine your job being to pull around
00:30:17,00:30:22,"a fake, much less developed version of yourself."
00:30:22,00:30:24,"Well, that's basically taking your child for a walk in the park,"
00:30:24,00:30:25,isn't it?
00:30:25,00:30:27,[LAUGHTER]
00:30:27,00:30:30,Because they used to put knights on loose horses
00:30:30,00:30:31,and sort of push them around.
00:30:31,00:30:34,They would have squires pulling the horses
00:30:34,00:30:36,so that they could practice their jousting.
00:30:36,00:30:38,What do you mean fake horses?
00:30:38,00:30:38,Like wooden horses?
00:30:38,00:30:41,"Yeah, wooden horses, exactly."
00:30:41,00:30:45,"They would try and hit a target called a quintane, wouldn't they?"
00:30:45,00:30:46,"Which we've mentioned on QI a quintane,"
00:30:46,00:30:48,but I don't think we've mentioned here.
00:30:48,00:30:53,"And it basically is a-- it's a wooden post with a target on,"
00:30:53,00:30:55,and the target is on a bit of a lever.
00:30:55,00:30:57,"So when you hit it, it flips around."
00:30:57,00:31:00,And that was the way that you would test how to do jousting.
00:31:00,00:31:03,"It was a crucial for jousting training,"
00:31:03,00:31:06,but jousting wasn't the most crucial thing that knights
00:31:06,00:31:07,"did in competitions, right?"
00:31:07,00:31:08,I think we've mentioned this on QI.
00:31:08,00:31:10,"But for most of the Middle Ages,"
00:31:10,00:31:12,"if you went to a tournament as a knight,"
00:31:12,00:31:16,"they did the melee, which was like a very chaotic--"
00:31:16,00:31:19,"it's like the Royal Rumble, wasn't it, melee?"
00:31:19,00:31:21,What's the Royal Rumble?
00:31:21,00:31:25,"Well, it began in medieval times."
00:31:25,00:31:26,Goddamn it.
00:31:26,00:31:28,That explained what the Royal Rumble is.
00:31:28,00:31:30,Nana's told us if this is the same as a melee.
00:31:30,00:31:36,Royal Rumble is a WWE event where you have about 30 wrestlers
00:31:36,00:31:39,who will all attack each other at the same time in the ring.
00:31:39,00:31:42,"They're staggered in, so you would have someone two people"
00:31:42,00:31:44,"started off, and then let's say every two minutes,"
00:31:44,00:31:47,"a new person enters the ring, to win the match,"
00:31:47,00:31:50,"you have to flip someone over the top rope,"
00:31:50,00:31:51,and they have to make contact with the floor.
00:31:51,00:31:53,So it's not exactly the same.
00:31:53,00:31:56,So it's the same way that there's loads of them involved
00:31:56,00:31:57,"or fighting each other, right?"
00:31:57,00:31:58,"Yeah, exactly."
00:31:58,00:32:01,"But also, like in the Royal Rumble, in the melee,"
00:32:01,00:32:03,you could kind of sneak in the corner
00:32:03,00:32:05,"and hide under some coats or something,"
00:32:05,00:32:08,"and let everyone else beat each other in the fight,"
00:32:08,00:32:10,and then you could jump out at the last minute and fight.
00:32:10,00:32:14,"Classic, classic Sean Michaels tactic of WWF."
00:32:14,00:32:15,Absolutely.
00:32:15,00:32:17,"Well, he actually got it from the medieval English."
00:32:17,00:32:21,Are there coats in the corner during a wrestling match?
00:32:21,00:32:22,"It feels like, as you're coming,"
00:32:22,00:32:26,"he just, ""Oh, leave your coat on the bed, we'll be."""
00:32:26,00:32:28,"The English used to be famous for this strategy,"
00:32:28,00:32:31,"where if there were lots of different groups around,"
00:32:31,00:32:32,the English would say they weren't going to play.
00:32:32,00:32:34,"They're not interested in the melee at all,"
00:32:34,00:32:36,so that all the other teams would play
00:32:36,00:32:38,"and really, really tie each other out."
00:32:38,00:32:40,"This was around the time of Henry II,"
00:32:40,00:32:42,"and once all the other teams are really, really tied out,"
00:32:42,00:32:45,"they've been knocked off their horses, they've run out of steam,"
00:32:45,00:32:46,"the English suddenly would gallop in,"
00:32:46,00:32:49,"and so we'd change our minds of playing, we're playing,"
00:32:49,00:32:52,and then they'd completely vanquished everyone else on the pitch.
00:32:52,00:32:53,-Wow. -That was what we were known for.
00:32:53,00:32:56,"Well, they probably, they wouldn't invite us back to the next melee,"
00:32:56,00:32:58,would they?
00:32:58,00:32:59,"We were, they're still doing them in France,"
00:32:59,00:33:01,"so we just never, we haven't been asked for 800 years."
00:33:01,00:33:04,"-Oh. -But the reason jousting became popular,"
00:33:04,00:33:07,do you know why it was switched to jousting from melee?
00:33:07,00:33:07,No.
00:33:07,00:33:11,"This is that knights were so violent, they were massive thugs,"
00:33:11,00:33:12,and it was a serious problem.
00:33:12,00:33:14,"So the first ever mass peace movement,"
00:33:14,00:33:16,"the peace and truth of God movement,"
00:33:16,00:33:20,was basically to stop knights from killing each other and everyone else.
00:33:20,00:33:22,"And they, so they used to do things like a knights tournament,"
00:33:22,00:33:24,"wouldn't just be in one area,"
00:33:24,00:33:26,"until the, quite near the end of the Middle Ages,"
00:33:26,00:33:29,"a knights tournament would be across the countryside,"
00:33:29,00:33:32,"so you have 29, and they're just fighting each other,"
00:33:32,00:33:33,"they gallop across the countryside,"
00:33:33,00:33:34,"they used to do things like,"
00:33:34,00:33:36,"they bash down the doors of peasant's homes,"
00:33:36,00:33:38,"and be like, you've got to give me a shelter,"
00:33:38,00:33:39,"let me hide in your cupboard,"
00:33:39,00:33:40,"and then if another knight came,"
00:33:40,00:33:42,"then they'd burn down the peasant's house,"
00:33:42,00:33:44,"to burn the knight's house, to get rid of him."
00:33:44,00:33:45,"There's nothing you can do,"
00:33:45,00:33:47,"as a peasant, you're obliged to give knights bed and board,"
00:33:47,00:33:48,if they ask for it.
00:33:48,00:33:50,"And they used to ruin people's crops,"
00:33:50,00:33:53,"you know, they'd burn down fences and hedges."
00:33:53,00:33:55,"It was just chaos, and so..."
00:33:55,00:33:56,That was amazing.
00:33:56,00:33:59,"It's had super fun, incredibly fun,"
00:33:59,00:34:00,"and I think mainly the clergy said,"
00:34:00,00:34:02,this is getting out of control.
00:34:02,00:34:05,Let's make it one-on-one about the shall we.
00:34:05,00:34:07,"So if you had a house, and the knight came along,"
00:34:07,00:34:10,"and they said, we want to stay in your house,"
00:34:10,00:34:11,you had to let them stay.
00:34:11,00:34:14,"It was actually if it was your Lord,"
00:34:14,00:34:15,"but yeah, it would usually be that guy,"
00:34:15,00:34:18,"and you had to feed them for as long as they wanted feeding,"
00:34:18,00:34:19,"and give them somewhere to sleep,"
00:34:19,00:34:20,"which was pretty harsh,"
00:34:20,00:34:21,"because they obviously had enough to eat,"
00:34:21,00:34:22,"and by and large, you didn't."
00:34:22,00:34:23,Yeah.
00:34:23,00:34:25,"They must have come over and said,"
00:34:25,00:34:26,can I stay with you?
00:34:26,00:34:27,"And you said, how many knights?"
00:34:27,00:34:28,"And they said, well, there's 600 others."
00:34:28,00:34:31,LAUGHTER
00:34:31,00:34:34,On innovations of how it slowly evolved
00:34:34,00:34:38,"into the modern-day carousel merry-ground that we have,"
00:34:38,00:34:40,I was trying to find at what points
00:34:40,00:34:42,"it sort of turned more and more into what we have,"
00:34:42,00:34:45,"and I discovered, now I'm still on the case"
00:34:45,00:34:47,"with this investigation, I must say."
00:34:47,00:34:49,"So this might be wrong,"
00:34:49,00:34:53,but I think that the person who invented the device
00:34:53,00:34:55,that allowed the horse to go up and down the pole
00:34:55,00:34:57,"as it's going round,"
00:34:57,00:34:58,"you see, you know what I'm talking about?"
00:34:58,00:35:00,"How, yeah, so it's a string fellow."
00:35:00,00:35:01,Yeah.
00:35:01,00:35:04,LAUGHTER
00:35:04,00:35:08,"It was a bad called Merlin, which is a nice-- No."
00:35:08,00:35:13,"Yeah, I believe that it was a man called John Joseph Merlin."
00:35:13,00:35:15,"Now, he's been mentioned on the podcast before,"
00:35:15,00:35:18,because he was the man who invented roller skates
00:35:18,00:35:21,and first displayed them when he played a violin at a party
00:35:21,00:35:24,and ended up crashing into a giant mirror.
00:35:24,00:35:26,"You remember him, this is that very same man."
00:35:26,00:35:31,And he was an amazing inventor during his lifetime
00:35:31,00:35:33,"of living in London, particularly."
00:35:33,00:35:35,He was from Belgium to begin with.
00:35:35,00:35:37,And he invented all sorts of things
00:35:37,00:35:40,like a self-propelled wheelchair.
00:35:40,00:35:43,He had a pedal-operated revolving tea table.
00:35:43,00:35:46,He had mechanical chariots that used to go around London.
00:35:46,00:35:50,"And he had his own museum, which was called the Merlin's Mechanical"
00:35:50,00:35:55,"Museum, and in it is the description of this carousel"
00:35:55,00:35:58,with horses that go up and down and noble people
00:35:58,00:36:02,"and rich people of the time used to come and hire it out,"
00:36:02,00:36:04,specifically just to have rides on it at this place.
00:36:04,00:36:08,"So this is, he died at the beginning of 1800, 1803."
00:36:08,00:36:10,So we're talking late 1700s here.
00:36:10,00:36:13,It's the first description that I can find of that innovation
00:36:13,00:36:16,"of the horse going up and down, invented by Merlin."
00:36:16,00:36:19,"So is your theory that Merlin first existed in the 1800s,"
00:36:19,00:36:22,"invented that, and then went back in time to King Arthur"
00:36:22,00:36:25,"and co, and brought with him his training after the night?"
00:36:25,00:36:28,"Well, you've taken the theory further, but I'm on board."
00:36:28,00:36:30,I absolutely will fold that into the idea.
00:36:30,00:36:34,"And Merlin, I believe, in the Disney Sword and the Stone,"
00:36:34,00:36:37,"which is very closely original story, it's not."
00:36:37,00:36:40,Merlin at the end enters on roller skates.
00:36:40,00:36:41,Is he?
00:36:41,00:36:45,"So this is all coming together, fairly certain."
00:36:45,00:36:47,"Wow, it's just a shame no one will hear it once, James."
00:36:47,00:36:48,Is that it?
00:36:48,00:36:55,"Oh, I have a fact about aeroplane rides at a fun fair."
00:36:55,00:36:59,"OK, so the flight simulating aeroplane ride at a fun fair,"
00:36:59,00:37:01,where you sit in a little plane and it moves up
00:37:01,00:37:03,and left and right and rolls around a bit.
00:37:03,00:37:06,That was invented to train pilots.
00:37:06,00:37:07,Wow.
00:37:07,00:37:07,That is terrifying.
00:37:07,00:37:14,"Genuinely, this was built in the early '30s, I think,"
00:37:14,00:37:17,"maybe late '20s, by an event called Lee Ily."
00:37:17,00:37:20,"He built a small plane called the orientator,"
00:37:20,00:37:21,and it would tilt left and right.
00:37:21,00:37:23,It was in this huge y-shaped fork.
00:37:23,00:37:27,"So the plane was stuck in the y of the fork, as it were."
00:37:27,00:37:29,And it would turn and roll and twist.
00:37:29,00:37:32,And he thought this would be useful for training pilots.
00:37:32,00:37:34,"And he only sold five of them, all of them"
00:37:34,00:37:37,to the Cuban government.
00:37:37,00:37:40,And that's what it was used for.
00:37:40,00:37:41,"And then a friend of his saw it and said,"
00:37:41,00:37:44,have you suggested turning it into a carnival ride?
00:37:44,00:37:46,Because that looks really fun.
00:37:46,00:37:48,And that's what he did.
00:37:48,00:37:49,And he spent the rest of his life inventing
00:37:49,00:37:52,the Lupo plane and the Rollo plane and the Rocco plane
00:37:52,00:37:53,and all these rides.
00:37:53,00:37:54,That's amazing.
00:37:54,00:37:56,"I mean, you've got the carousel, which"
00:37:56,00:37:59,"was for training nights, and you've got this for training."
00:37:59,00:38:02,"You know, that big boat that kind of goes up and down"
00:38:02,00:38:03,in a rocking motion.
00:38:03,00:38:06,Is that to train Vikings or something?
00:38:06,00:38:07,Yeah.
00:38:07,00:38:10,That's where Admiral Nelson was going to describe us.
00:38:10,00:38:14,[MUSIC PLAYING]
00:38:14,00:38:16,"OK, it is time for our final fact of the show."
00:38:16,00:38:18,And that is James.
00:38:18,00:38:22,"OK, my fact this week is that in some parts of Japan,"
00:38:22,00:38:25,earwigs are known as Chinpo Kiri.
00:38:25,00:38:30,Literally penis cutters.
00:38:30,00:38:34,They're much more powerful in Japan.
00:38:34,00:38:37,I don't think they're literally cutting penises.
00:38:37,00:38:41,"I think it might be-- well, OK, so let me tell you where I found this."
00:38:41,00:38:44,It basically came up on my RSS feed last week.
00:38:44,00:38:46,But I went to look for evidence.
00:38:46,00:38:49,I found a paper from 2013 from a Japanese entomologist
00:38:49,00:38:54,called Kenta Takada called vulgar dialects names of earwigs
00:38:54,00:38:57,used in the Kansai region of Japan.
00:38:57,00:39:01,"OK, so I went on to Google Translate"
00:39:01,00:39:02,because this paper was in Japanese.
00:39:02,00:39:06,And it seems like the reason that they're called this
00:39:06,00:39:09,is when they have penises in the back earwigs don't they.
00:39:09,00:39:11,"On their bumps, they have like these little penises."
00:39:11,00:39:14,"And also in Japan, in this particular area,"
00:39:14,00:39:18,"Kansai area, which is round Oscar and wherever,"
00:39:18,00:39:20,they were found in toilets.
00:39:20,00:39:21,They were found around toilets.
00:39:21,00:39:24,So it might be that if you see something
00:39:24,00:39:26,"with pinces on it around the toilets,"
00:39:26,00:39:29,you might call it a penis cutter because it's like there
00:39:29,00:39:31,might be a folklore that that would happen.
00:39:31,00:39:32,"Yeah, makes sense."
00:39:32,00:39:35,So we don't think they actually cut penises.
00:39:35,00:39:38,But it's just that it so happens that in this particular part
00:39:38,00:39:42,"of Japan, they give it a rude name."
00:39:42,00:39:45,I'm sure you guys have researched earwig penises.
00:39:45,00:39:46,"Oh, yeah."
00:39:46,00:39:46,All over it.
00:39:46,00:39:49,Because this is another Japanese connection.
00:39:49,00:39:52,"If you search Japan earwig penis,"
00:39:52,00:39:56,it brings up a study done by Yoshitaka Kamimura
00:39:56,00:39:58,of the Tokyo Metropolitan University
00:39:58,00:40:02,who deliberately broke earwig penises off
00:40:02,00:40:04,while they were mid-sex.
00:40:04,00:40:05,That's not very nice.
00:40:05,00:40:07,Just out of my ass.
00:40:07,00:40:07,Not out of my ass.
00:40:07,00:40:10,So there is a species.
00:40:10,00:40:13,Lots of species have two penises.
00:40:13,00:40:15,The males do anyway.
00:40:15,00:40:17,And there was a lot of theorizing about whether they were used
00:40:17,00:40:18,or not.
00:40:18,00:40:24,"And so Yoshitaka Kamimura, he decided to test it"
00:40:24,00:40:25,and his colleagues.
00:40:25,00:40:27,And they would interrupt mating earwigs
00:40:27,00:40:29,by pinching the male and lifting him off.
00:40:29,00:40:31,"And because they're very, very, very long penises"
00:40:31,00:40:33,"relative to the earwig, they're the same length again."
00:40:33,00:40:36,They're quite easily broken and they're quite sensitive.
00:40:36,00:40:39,So the penises all broke off.
00:40:39,00:40:43,"But within two days, they found that these males"
00:40:43,00:40:46,who'd had a penis broken off could inseminate new females
00:40:46,00:40:48,they were introduced to.
00:40:48,00:40:52,And they collected 663 of these earwigs from around Japan
00:40:52,00:40:55,just to test whether they had been undergoing similar problems
00:40:55,00:40:57,without the scientists interfering
00:40:57,00:40:58,and snapping their penises off.
00:40:58,00:41:01,And they found that only a few had had sexual accidents
00:41:01,00:41:02,"like this, but a few had."
00:41:02,00:41:04,So three males had lost a penis.
00:41:04,00:41:08,And two females had a severed penis inside them
00:41:08,00:41:09,from an earlier.
00:41:09,00:41:12,So that's only one penis unaccounted for from those.
00:41:12,00:41:13,It's good.
00:41:13,00:41:16,Keep your eyes peeled.
00:41:16,00:41:18,The other thing that was the second penis
00:41:18,00:41:19,"is the wrong way around, right?"
00:41:19,00:41:22,So they must have to learn a whole new sexual position
00:41:22,00:41:24,in that two-day period.
00:41:24,00:41:26,I assumed it just moved into the position
00:41:26,00:41:29,"vacated by the first one, but you might well be right."
00:41:29,00:41:30,"Oh, OK, I don't know."
00:41:30,00:41:35,"Well, they think they have two because they used to use"
00:41:35,00:41:36,both at the same time.
00:41:36,00:41:38,"Well, some species only have one."
00:41:38,00:41:41,"Some species only have one, but of the ones who have two,"
00:41:41,00:41:45,they think that some females might have had a double vagina.
00:41:45,00:41:47,"I think they've found double vaginaed females, right?"
00:41:47,00:41:51,But they've never witnessed the double penises
00:41:51,00:41:52,interacting with the double vaginas.
00:41:52,00:41:55,"But it does seem like the obvious thing, doesn't it?"
00:41:55,00:41:59,"If you've ever seen a glove and a hand,"
00:41:59,00:42:01,you do automatically see what's going in the other.
00:42:01,00:42:07,"But then you do find men with only one hand,"
00:42:07,00:42:08,and they're women with an extra hand
00:42:08,00:42:10,"found in their glove, don't you?"
00:42:10,00:42:13,[LAUGHTER]
00:42:13,00:42:19,I was just wondering if maybe the Japanese name penis cutters
00:42:19,00:42:21,might be because they cut their own penis off sometimes
00:42:21,00:42:24,when it falls off accidentally.
00:42:24,00:42:27,So maybe it's not you're worried about your own penis.
00:42:27,00:42:29,You're kind of worried about the--
00:42:29,00:42:30,"No, I don't think that's true."
00:42:30,00:42:32,I don't think so.
00:42:32,00:42:34,"I really, really don't like earwigs."
00:42:34,00:42:37,And I very rarely come across them in my day-to-day life.
00:42:37,00:42:39,"But I remember, as a child, thinking they're really"
00:42:39,00:42:41,"scaring, because they can really net view."
00:42:41,00:42:42,Can they?
00:42:42,00:42:44,"Yeah, when they get their little pincers together,"
00:42:44,00:42:45,they can really be--
00:42:45,00:42:46,I don't know if I've ever seen one.
00:42:46,00:42:47,"Yeah, I've never seen one."
00:42:47,00:42:48,Weirdly.
00:42:48,00:42:49,You've never seen a name?
00:42:49,00:42:54,"They're a bit like any movie from before, 1993."
00:42:54,00:42:56,But I don't recall ever seen it.
00:42:56,00:42:58,"You get them in the UK, I suppose you must do,"
00:42:58,00:42:59,but I don't remember.
00:42:59,00:43:00,I cannot believe this is literally
00:43:00,00:43:02,like you've never seen an ant.
00:43:02,00:43:03,I've never seen one.
00:43:03,00:43:04,"Well, you just have never looked at the floor."
00:43:04,00:43:06,I just think maybe I've seen them
00:43:06,00:43:08,and just thought it was a beetle or something.
00:43:08,00:43:09,Yeah.
00:43:09,00:43:11,"They look like little scorpions, really, don't they?"
00:43:11,00:43:13,Because of the pincers.
00:43:13,00:43:15,"And the pincers are-- they're very strange,"
00:43:15,00:43:17,because it's quite weird having this defensive device
00:43:17,00:43:18,on your backside.
00:43:18,00:43:22,"And it has a few purposes, but one is for males"
00:43:22,00:43:26,to spar with each other and to show who's dominant or whatever.
00:43:26,00:43:28,But I was watching a video of two male earwig sparring
00:43:28,00:43:30,"with their pincers, and it's so awkward,"
00:43:30,00:43:33,because imagine kind of having to spar with someone
00:43:33,00:43:35,with your butt cheeks.
00:43:35,00:43:37,So they have to prey around with their necks
00:43:37,00:43:42,"to try and control their pincers, so they're jumping at each other."
00:43:42,00:43:43,It's just-- it's so--
00:43:43,00:43:45,"That is a royal rumble, I want to see."
00:43:45,00:43:47,[LAUGHTER]
00:43:47,00:43:49,You're only allowed to use your butt.
00:43:49,00:43:50,Yeah.
00:43:50,00:43:52,"Leave your coat on the bed, and leave your trousers under it."
00:43:52,00:43:56,[LAUGHTER]
00:43:56,00:44:00,"Well, also, it's not a fight to the death."
00:44:00,00:44:02,"It's just a fight to when someone's like,"
00:44:02,00:44:03,"oh, OK, I've had it off."
00:44:03,00:44:06,"And they declare a winner, and they go off"
00:44:06,00:44:09,"and they burrow themselves in a sort of shameful hiding,"
00:44:09,00:44:10,don't they?
00:44:10,00:44:11,"Yeah, what?"
00:44:11,00:44:14,"Yeah, they get-- it's sort of like once you've lost,"
00:44:14,00:44:17,"they jump away, and then they dig themselves a hole"
00:44:17,00:44:18,and stay in there.
00:44:18,00:44:21,"And the victor is sort of like, yeah, I don't know why."
00:44:21,00:44:21,Wow.
00:44:21,00:44:24,"So they can cry in peace, I think."
00:44:24,00:44:25,Once Andy had had that scented ball
00:44:25,00:44:28,"explode all over his face, he spent some time alone"
00:44:28,00:44:30,"in a bathroom cubicle, didn't he?"
00:44:30,00:44:33,[LAUGHTER]
00:44:33,00:44:33,That's amazing.
00:44:33,00:44:36,"It's amazing that Earwigs have shame and honor codes,"
00:44:36,00:44:38,like there are any of us.
00:44:38,00:44:39,I'm just surprised.
00:44:39,00:44:41,And they've got very strong family values.
00:44:41,00:44:43,So the sibling stayed together much longer
00:44:43,00:44:44,than they need to.
00:44:44,00:44:47,"Another Earwig raises her young, and she's very attached,"
00:44:47,00:44:49,"and she's very sweet, so she sits on her eggs"
00:44:49,00:44:51,and then on her nymphs on her baby Earwigs.
00:44:51,00:44:53,She'll sit on top of them all to nurture them
00:44:53,00:44:56,and lick all the mold and fungi off them.
00:44:56,00:44:59,And then the Earwigs are ready to leave the nest
00:44:59,00:45:02,"very early on, but they all stay together anyway."
00:45:02,00:45:03,And they think it might be something to do with the fact
00:45:03,00:45:06,that they all eat other's feces.
00:45:06,00:45:07,So when time gets up--
00:45:07,00:45:09,That was so nice until then.
00:45:09,00:45:11,"It was reminded me of how during lockdown,"
00:45:11,00:45:15,I'm seeing a lot of my family on Zoom quizzes and stuff.
00:45:15,00:45:17,"I'm like, oh, we're a bit like Earwigs,"
00:45:17,00:45:18,but we don't eat each other's shit.
00:45:18,00:45:20,"Well, it's one of the main problems with Zoom, isn't it?"
00:45:20,00:45:22,And then they're trying to overcome this problem
00:45:22,00:45:23,with the technology.
00:45:23,00:45:25,Because these guys eat each other's poop.
00:45:25,00:45:27,And it's only when they don't have much food left.
00:45:27,00:45:28,"Oh, yeah."
00:45:28,00:45:29,It eats food.
00:45:29,00:45:31,"You wouldn't-- yeah, if you have a pizza in the freezer,"
00:45:31,00:45:35,"you're not going to go straight for that too, right?"
00:45:35,00:45:38,That's pretty much their attitude.
00:45:38,00:45:40,But it does seem to help them stay alive for an extra few days
00:45:40,00:45:41,in times of one.
00:45:41,00:45:44,"The mum, though, you say that she's very caring."
00:45:44,00:45:45,"And absolutely, that's right."
00:45:45,00:45:49,"But she does do an interesting survival of the fittest thing,"
00:45:49,00:45:51,whereby the mothers have the ability
00:45:51,00:45:56,to smell out who the healthier of their offspring are.
00:45:56,00:45:58,It's a chemical smell that comes off the offspring
00:45:58,00:45:59,that they can smell.
00:45:59,00:46:00,And so once they've identified--
00:46:00,00:46:04,"because they have such a big collection of babies,"
00:46:04,00:46:07,"it's something like up to 60, I think I read."
00:46:07,00:46:08,30 to 60 at a time.
00:46:08,00:46:11,So they need to make sure that the healthy ones
00:46:11,00:46:11,are the ones that survive.
00:46:11,00:46:13,So they smell them out.
00:46:13,00:46:14,"And once they know which ones they are,"
00:46:14,00:46:18,they'll give them more shit to eat just to make them healthier.
00:46:18,00:46:22,And they'll pay less attention to the less healthy ones.
00:46:22,00:46:23,Yeah.
00:46:23,00:46:24,Ouch.
00:46:24,00:46:26,"So yeah, survival of the fittest."
00:46:26,00:46:28,"Good mums, but also very, very disciplined."
00:46:28,00:46:30,Mm-hmm.
00:46:30,00:46:35,This fight was about the names of earwigs and what people call them.
00:46:35,00:46:39,"In different countries, they have really weird synonyms."
00:46:39,00:46:40,I don't know if synonyms are right words.
00:46:40,00:46:43,"So like the manks word in the Isle of Man,"
00:46:43,00:46:46,their word for earwig is the same as their word for a dung fork.
00:46:46,00:46:47,A dung fork?
00:46:47,00:46:48,A dung fork.
00:46:48,00:46:50,You know like a pitchfork that you use to pick up dung
00:46:50,00:46:51,and then move it from one part of the farm
00:46:51,00:46:53,to the other part of the farm?
00:46:53,00:46:54,"Oh, yeah, yeah."
00:46:54,00:46:55,So just a dung fork.
00:46:55,00:46:58,Is that what the earwigs use to eat their siblings' feces as well?
00:46:58,00:47:04,"In Scotch, Gaelic, the word for earwig is the same as the word"
00:47:04,00:47:07,for having your mouth so full that your cheeks puff out.
00:47:07,00:47:08,What?
00:47:08,00:47:09,I don't know.
00:47:09,00:47:10,I don't know.
00:47:10,00:47:11,It's so weird.
00:47:11,00:47:14,The Greek word for earwigs is the same as the word for alligator
00:47:14,00:47:16,and pruning scissors.
00:47:16,00:47:21,The Hungarian word for earwigs is the same for a catchy song.
00:47:21,00:47:22,Like an earwag.
00:47:22,00:47:23,"Oh, an earwag."
00:47:23,00:47:24,An earwag.
00:47:24,00:47:27,"In German, it's an oven, I think, in earwigs as well."
00:47:27,00:47:29,So that must be a link between those two.
00:47:29,00:47:30,"Yeah, okay."
00:47:30,00:47:32,It makes me think that it must have been very confusing and greets.
00:47:32,00:47:35,"If you said to somebody, could you please go and fetch my pruning scissors"
00:47:35,00:47:37,there in the second drawer down in my bedroom?
00:47:37,00:47:39,Come back with an alligator.
00:47:39,00:47:40,"Are you come back with an alligator, sir?"
00:47:40,00:47:43,"I mean, it's a dangerous game."
00:47:43,00:47:47,"In Spanish, the word for earwigs is same as for an overhead kick and football."
00:47:47,00:47:48,"Oh, cool."
00:47:48,00:47:49,Wow.
00:47:49,00:47:50,So weird.
00:47:50,00:47:51,Yeah.
00:47:51,00:47:52,"Oh, wait."
00:47:52,00:47:53,I have a theory about why that one might be.
00:47:53,00:47:54,"Oh, what?"
00:47:54,00:47:55,It's a pretty tenuous theory.
00:47:55,00:48:01,"But when earwigs are mating, they have a really complicated sort of dance they do,"
00:48:01,00:48:02,getting to know each other.
00:48:02,00:48:04,And I think they smell each other.
00:48:04,00:48:07,And the male might do a little bit of flexing to show off.
00:48:07,00:48:10,And the female nibbles his forceps.
00:48:10,00:48:14,"And after about ten minutes, she will raise up her abdomen at the back, right?"
00:48:14,00:48:20,And then the male has to twist his abdomen 180 degrees left to right.
00:48:20,00:48:22,"So his bum is upside down, basically."
00:48:22,00:48:23,And that means that it's facing upwards.
00:48:23,00:48:26,And that means that he can couple with her.
00:48:26,00:48:28,And then they spend several hours having sex.
00:48:28,00:48:35,But that flexibility of the abdomen might be why the bicycle kick has the same name as
00:48:35,00:48:36,the earwigs.
00:48:36,00:48:37,It could help it.
00:48:37,00:48:38,It could help it.
00:48:38,00:48:41,So can you tell me why the Ukrainian word for earwigs is the same as their word for
00:48:41,00:48:42,pimp?
00:48:42,00:48:43,Well.
00:48:43,00:48:49,"Again, it's to do with turning your bum 180 degrees."
00:48:49,00:48:55,"Okay, that is it."
00:48:55,00:48:56,That is all of our facts.
