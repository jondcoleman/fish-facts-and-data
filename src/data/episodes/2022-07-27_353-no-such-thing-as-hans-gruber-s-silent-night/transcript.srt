00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,760
 (somber music)

2
00:00:02,760 --> 00:00:04,960
 - Hey everyone, welcome to this week's episode of Fish,

3
00:00:04,960 --> 00:00:06,360
 a very special episode.

4
00:00:06,360 --> 00:00:09,560
 It is our 2020 Christmas Spectacular,

5
00:00:09,560 --> 00:00:11,960
 recorded live at King's Place in London

6
00:00:11,960 --> 00:00:14,440
 to an audience of zero.

7
00:00:14,440 --> 00:00:17,040
 There was literally no one sitting in the room with us

8
00:00:17,040 --> 00:00:18,400
 in this giant hall.

9
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:20,200
 There were of course people live streaming it

10
00:00:20,200 --> 00:00:22,520
 and a huge thank you to everyone who joined us on the night

11
00:00:22,520 --> 00:00:24,320
 from whatever bit of the world you live in.

12
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:25,840
 It was a really fun night.

13
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:29,260
 We had a lot of fun with Christmas crackers and presents

14
00:00:29,260 --> 00:00:31,880
 and we did a Q and A at the end of the show.

15
00:00:31,880 --> 00:00:34,280
 In fact, if you wanna watch the full extended version

16
00:00:34,280 --> 00:00:36,080
 of the show that you're about to hear,

17
00:00:36,080 --> 00:00:40,440
 you can go to qi.com/fish and buy a ticket to the stream

18
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:42,760
 and it's already happened, but you can watch the show

19
00:00:42,760 --> 00:00:45,880
 and that'll be up there until the end of the year.

20
00:00:45,880 --> 00:00:48,080
 In the meantime, we hope you enjoy this show

21
00:00:48,080 --> 00:00:49,720
 and we hope you have a merry Christmas.

22
00:00:49,720 --> 00:00:51,960
 We know it's a tough one this year.

23
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:54,320
 We send you all our love and we look forward to seeing you

24
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:57,040
 all in the new year, hopefully live and in person,

25
00:00:57,040 --> 00:00:59,780
 but if not, well, we'll still be here every week

26
00:00:59,780 --> 00:01:02,100
 on the internet, telling our favorite facts

27
00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:03,660
 to each other and to you.

28
00:01:03,660 --> 00:01:05,380
 All right, Dorks, we love you.

29
00:01:05,380 --> 00:01:07,340
 Merry Christmas and enjoy the show.

30
00:01:07,340 --> 00:01:11,680
 (upbeat music)

31
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:25,740
 - Hello and welcome to another episode

32
00:01:25,740 --> 00:01:28,360
 of No Such Thing as a Fish, a weekly podcast

33
00:01:28,360 --> 00:01:31,580
 coming to you live from King's Place in London.

34
00:01:31,580 --> 00:01:36,320
 - I'll edit the chairs in later.

35
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:37,700
 - We'll get that in.

36
00:01:37,700 --> 00:01:39,000
 My name is Dan Schreiber.

37
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,800
 I am sitting here with Anna Tyshinski, Andrew Hunter Murray

38
00:01:41,800 --> 00:01:43,960
 and James Harkin and once again,

39
00:01:43,960 --> 00:01:45,920
 we have gathered around the microphones

40
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:48,680
 with our four favorite facts from the last seven days

41
00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:51,980
 and in no particular order, here we go.

42
00:01:51,980 --> 00:01:54,600
 Starting with fact number one, and that's my fact this week,

43
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:57,620
 my fact is that every year in the UK,

44
00:01:57,620 --> 00:02:00,140
 a joke committee gets together to whittle down

45
00:02:00,140 --> 00:02:03,860
 a short list of jokes that they think are unfunny enough

46
00:02:03,860 --> 00:02:05,620
 to put in Christmas crackers.

47
00:02:05,620 --> 00:02:07,540
 - Amazing.

48
00:02:07,540 --> 00:02:09,340
 - Yeah, there's a company called Robin Reed,

49
00:02:09,340 --> 00:02:11,140
 which was set up by a guy called Julian Reed

50
00:02:11,140 --> 00:02:13,780
 and every year they get together, a group of them,

51
00:02:13,780 --> 00:02:17,340
 they sit in a room and they each read out jokes

52
00:02:17,340 --> 00:02:19,860
 and if it gets a laugh, Julian rejects it.

53
00:02:19,860 --> 00:02:20,700
 - Really?

54
00:02:20,700 --> 00:02:22,220
 - He says, nope, that's not going in.

55
00:02:22,220 --> 00:02:23,060
 - Oh, wow.

56
00:02:23,060 --> 00:02:25,100
 - It's this big theory, which I think a lot of people know,

57
00:02:25,100 --> 00:02:27,100
 which is that the idea of cracker jokes

58
00:02:27,100 --> 00:02:28,620
 is that they're not meant to be funny,

59
00:02:28,620 --> 00:02:31,460
 they're meant to be grown worthy because you don't wanna

60
00:02:31,460 --> 00:02:34,740
 isolate anyone at the dinner table of wanting to tell a joke

61
00:02:34,740 --> 00:02:36,380
 if they know that they might deliver it

62
00:02:36,380 --> 00:02:37,460
 and it won't get a laugh.

63
00:02:37,460 --> 00:02:38,940
 - And also if you're one of those kind of people

64
00:02:38,940 --> 00:02:41,140
 who doesn't really understand jokes very well,

65
00:02:41,140 --> 00:02:43,820
 you're not feeling bad because you're not laughing, right?

66
00:02:43,820 --> 00:02:46,140
 Everyone else is laughing, you're like, I don't understand.

67
00:02:46,140 --> 00:02:46,980
 - Yeah.

68
00:02:46,980 --> 00:02:49,500
 - I think Richard Wiseman theorized this, didn't he?

69
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:51,100
 Who's like, obviously a great psychologist

70
00:02:51,100 --> 00:02:52,600
 who also talks about Christmas crackers.

71
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:56,020
 But the idea is that you are supposed to blame your tools.

72
00:02:56,020 --> 00:02:57,420
 No one is a bad workman.

73
00:02:57,420 --> 00:02:59,620
 You don't humiliate anyone round the dinner table

74
00:02:59,620 --> 00:03:01,940
 that they can't deliver good jokes.

75
00:03:01,940 --> 00:03:03,980
 So it's all the jokes fault, which is quite nice.

76
00:03:03,980 --> 00:03:05,660
 It's a scapegoat, it's a scape joke.

77
00:03:05,660 --> 00:03:08,100
 - Okay, who do you think laughs most at cracker jokes?

78
00:03:08,100 --> 00:03:09,020
 - Who laughs most?

79
00:03:09,020 --> 00:03:11,940
 - Well, which profession member laughs most at cracker jokes?

80
00:03:11,940 --> 00:03:13,740
 - Well, comedians don't laugh at any jokes.

81
00:03:13,740 --> 00:03:14,580
 - No.

82
00:03:14,580 --> 00:03:15,420
 - To be honest.

83
00:03:15,420 --> 00:03:16,260
 - They just say that was good.

84
00:03:16,260 --> 00:03:17,100
 (laughing)

85
00:03:17,100 --> 00:03:19,260
 - Yeah, needs work, needs work.

86
00:03:19,260 --> 00:03:20,100
 Don't open with it.

87
00:03:21,980 --> 00:03:22,820
 - There was a survey.

88
00:03:22,820 --> 00:03:25,600
 They found a thousand people from 10 professions, okay,

89
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:28,780
 to take part, so a hundred from each job, right?

90
00:03:28,780 --> 00:03:30,000
 So they got 10 kinds of job.

91
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,360
 And their reactions were rated into a laugh, a smile,

92
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:33,640
 or nothing, okay?

93
00:03:33,640 --> 00:03:35,960
 And then they, Robin Reed released the results

94
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:37,080
 of this study.

95
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:39,240
 So the profession that laughed most

96
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:40,840
 was funeral directors.

97
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:41,920
 - Oh, really?

98
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:44,000
 - Then doctors, then accountants.

99
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:47,000
 The vickers were the least likely to laugh.

100
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,520
 I can't believe they got a hundred vickers

101
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:49,840
 and a hundred funeral directors

102
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:52,340
 and seriously got them to do this research.

103
00:03:52,340 --> 00:03:53,900
 - That's a fun sitcom, surely.

104
00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:56,420
 That science lab, they all get locks in.

105
00:03:56,420 --> 00:03:58,300
 A hundred vickers, a hundred funeral directors.

106
00:03:58,300 --> 00:04:00,620
 - Yeah, we get to pull these crackers, by the way.

107
00:04:00,620 --> 00:04:01,460
 Yeah, why not?

108
00:04:01,460 --> 00:04:02,300
 We can read our shit.

109
00:04:02,300 --> 00:04:03,140
 - Well, I know why not,

110
00:04:03,140 --> 00:04:04,380
 'cause we're not allowed to touch each other

111
00:04:04,380 --> 00:04:05,860
 or even get close to each other.

112
00:04:05,860 --> 00:04:07,140
 - We can pull our own crackers.

113
00:04:07,140 --> 00:04:07,980
 - Okay.

114
00:04:07,980 --> 00:04:08,820
 - Yeah.

115
00:04:08,820 --> 00:04:09,660
 - Okay.

116
00:04:09,660 --> 00:04:10,860
 - I actually, let me pull it out now.

117
00:04:10,860 --> 00:04:12,180
 I'm gonna tell you something about that.

118
00:04:12,180 --> 00:04:15,180
 - All right, it's gonna be an awkward silence now.

119
00:04:15,180 --> 00:04:17,340
 - Oh, that lovely smell.

120
00:04:17,340 --> 00:04:18,180
 - So nice.

121
00:04:18,180 --> 00:04:19,020
 - It's good, isn't it?

122
00:04:19,020 --> 00:04:19,920
 - Oh, nice smell.

123
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:21,240
 - Oh, okay.

124
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:22,620
 - Oh, God, I've got wounds here.

125
00:04:22,620 --> 00:04:23,920
 - I've got, yeah, I've got a joke here.

126
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:24,760
 - Okay.

127
00:04:24,760 --> 00:04:25,600
 - Yeah.

128
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:28,400
 - What did Adam say on the day before Christmas?

129
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:32,400
 - I was born many, many thousands of years before Jesus,

130
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:36,280
 so this really doesn't have any application to me as a person.

131
00:04:36,280 --> 00:04:37,920
 - Don't touch that fucking apple.

132
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:39,080
 (laughing)

133
00:04:39,080 --> 00:04:40,800
 - He said, "Happy Christmas, Eve."

134
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:42,520
 Or it's just a variation on that.

135
00:04:42,520 --> 00:04:43,480
 - A variation, you got it.

136
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:44,320
 It's Christmas.

137
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:45,160
 - Eve.

138
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:46,000
 - Well done.

139
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:46,840
 I've got one.

140
00:04:46,840 --> 00:04:50,560
 - Who played Edward Scissorhands in the movie of the same name?

141
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:53,160
 It was a Christian Bale, Edward Norton, Sean Penn,

142
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:54,080
 or Johnny Depp.

143
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:55,800
 - I don't get it.

144
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:56,640
 - No.

145
00:04:56,640 --> 00:04:58,800
 (laughing)

146
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:00,800
 - Is that one of those that you're not supposed to get?

147
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:01,640
 - I think so.

148
00:05:01,640 --> 00:05:02,480
 I think we all--

149
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:04,240
 - No, we're given facts as well.

150
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:05,080
 These are trivia questions.

151
00:05:05,080 --> 00:05:06,080
 - Oh, right, okay.

152
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:07,680
 - If we'd known about these crackers years ago,

153
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:09,880
 we could, this is a goldmine of information.

154
00:05:09,880 --> 00:05:12,480
 - I've got one.

155
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:14,480
 I'm gonna save that one for fact number four.

156
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:15,720
 - Who got these crackers?

157
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:16,560
 Are you really?

158
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:17,400
 - No.

159
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:18,240
 - Okay, here's a joke.

160
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:19,080
 - Reminds me of jokes, yeah.

161
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:21,640
 - Why did the oyster leave the party early?

162
00:05:21,640 --> 00:05:26,040
 - 'Cause he'd had a shucking bad time.

163
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:27,800
 - That's really good, but no.

164
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:30,520
 - 'Cause he was being really shellfish.

165
00:05:30,520 --> 00:05:34,760
 - These are so much better than the slightly sexist one

166
00:05:34,760 --> 00:05:35,600
 that I've got.

167
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:37,400
 - Why did the oyster leave the party early?

168
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:38,240
 - Yes.

169
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:40,080
 - 'Cause he wanted to get a pearly night.

170
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:42,200
 - Pearly, pearly, yeah, yeah, yeah.

171
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:44,800
 No, he pulled a muscle.

172
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:45,640
 - Oh.

173
00:05:45,640 --> 00:05:46,480
 - He pulled a muscle.

174
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:47,300
 - Oh, nice.

175
00:05:47,300 --> 00:05:48,140
 - That's deep.

176
00:05:48,140 --> 00:05:48,980
 - So.

177
00:05:48,980 --> 00:05:49,800
 - Do you say sexy as opposed to sexy?

178
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:50,840
 - Sexy, it should have been sexy, shouldn't it?

179
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:51,680
 - Yeah, very sexy.

180
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:54,200
 - I have the world, I had the world record

181
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:56,520
 for pulling crackers on your own.

182
00:05:56,520 --> 00:05:59,920
 For a short amount of time earlier this year.

183
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:00,760
 - Guinness world record.

184
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:01,600
 - Guinness world record.

185
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:04,160
 As in the guy from Guinness was there and watched me do it

186
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:07,280
 and counted how many I pulled and I beat the world record,

187
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:09,920
 only for it to be beaten about three hours later

188
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:11,400
 by Alan Davis.

189
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:12,240
 - No.

190
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:15,040
 - Yeah, so we did it in a QI rehearsal.

191
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:17,600
 And I was pretending to be Alan for the show

192
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:19,240
 and they gave me two boxes of crackers

193
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:21,320
 and saw how many I could pull in a minute.

194
00:06:21,320 --> 00:06:23,960
 And I, yeah, absolutely smashed it.

195
00:06:23,960 --> 00:06:25,680
 And then because I did so many,

196
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:27,360
 they gave Alan an extra box

197
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:28,880
 and then he could beat my record.

198
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:29,720
 - Oh.

199
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:30,560
 - That's sad.

200
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:31,760
 - How many did you get?

201
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:34,240
 - It was two full boxes, so it must have been 24.

202
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:36,000
 - Did he manage to make a call back to HQ

203
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,480
 and say log Harken down

204
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:39,280
 or did you just miss that altogether?

205
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:41,160
 - No, I might have got really lucky

206
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:43,280
 that when they were printing the Guinness Book of Records

207
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:46,720
 in 2020, it was just in that, you know, two-hour slot.

208
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:49,480
 - I wonder why you kept changing the recording schedule,

209
00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:50,920
 didn't you, to make sure?

210
00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:53,480
 - I've got another one.

211
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:55,880
 - Which actress and her mother died within a day of each other

212
00:06:55,880 --> 00:06:57,800
 in December, 2016?

213
00:06:57,800 --> 00:06:59,400
 - This is genuinely in a cracker.

214
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:01,880
 - It's Carrie Fisher and Debbie Reynolds.

215
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:03,400
 - Debbie Reynolds, that's right.

216
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:05,160
 - To be honest, the funeral directors

217
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:07,120
 would have pissed themselves at that one.

218
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:11,440
 - Christmas has come, you're bang on time for them.

219
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:12,960
 - It's genuinely a Christmasy thing.

220
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:14,200
 - What have you got?

221
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:15,200
 I've had Johnny Depp

222
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:17,240
 and I've had people dying within a day of each other.

223
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:18,280
 - You just haven't got the joke out

224
00:07:18,280 --> 00:07:19,440
 with a slightly different format

225
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:21,680
 and you can't tell the difference between a fact and a joke,

226
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:23,000
 which is what's been holding his back for years.

227
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,480
 - Who played the role of Nelson Mandela

228
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:26,480
 in the 2009 film Invictus?

229
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:29,240
 What is this cracker?

230
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:32,520
 - This is bullshit.

231
00:07:32,520 --> 00:07:33,360
 - Jesus.

232
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:37,080
 - I've got another joke from Christmas Crackers.

233
00:07:37,080 --> 00:07:40,400
 And that is, what kind of medicine does Dracula take?

234
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:42,680
 - Blood.

235
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:44,040
 - The answer is, and you'll get this

236
00:07:44,040 --> 00:07:45,520
 in quite a lot of your crackers this year.

237
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:47,840
 A lot of people will get this in their crackers this year.

238
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:52,560
 The answer is con-medicine, C-O-N medicine.

239
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:54,280
 Doesn't make any sense, right?

240
00:07:54,280 --> 00:07:56,560
 So according to Matt Parker, who is our friend,

241
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:59,760
 who's a mathematician and all around good guy,

242
00:07:59,760 --> 00:08:04,080
 according to him, when computers write down the letters F-F-I,

243
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:07,880
 okay, the FF and I'll kind of squish together.

244
00:08:07,880 --> 00:08:10,800
 So instead of putting them down as actual letters on their own,

245
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:13,520
 they have just an F-F-I character.

246
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:17,240
 So it's just one code that they put in just for the F-F-I.

247
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:19,680
 Now, not all computers can read that.

248
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:22,240
 Not all computers know that when they see that code,

249
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:23,400
 they're supposed to put F-F-I.

250
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:25,480
 So some of them just miss it out.

251
00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:28,840
 And so it's supposed to be coffin medicine,

252
00:08:28,840 --> 00:08:30,680
 but loads and loads of cracker companies

253
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:32,520
 have this particular computer system

254
00:08:32,520 --> 00:08:34,280
 that misses out the F-F-I.

255
00:08:34,280 --> 00:08:35,640
 And for years and years and years,

256
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:37,120
 you'll see it on the internet every year.

257
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:38,360
 People see this and they're like,

258
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:39,320
 I don't get this joke.

259
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:40,560
 Oh, what's it mean?

260
00:08:40,560 --> 00:08:41,440
 What's it mean?

261
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:42,240
 That's so good.

262
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:44,000
 That's amazing.

263
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,440
 You know, you claimed you had alleged that yours was sexist,

264
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:47,280
 even though it wasn't, it was sexy.

265
00:08:47,280 --> 00:08:48,200
 It wasn't, really, yeah.

266
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:48,560
 But--

267
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:49,440
 I don't think it was sexy.

268
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:50,480
 Sorry, I've got to say.

269
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:51,600
 I think it was sexy.

270
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:52,360
 I was certainly aroused.

271
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:54,280
 All the muscle.

272
00:08:54,280 --> 00:08:57,600
 Well, the person who runs the Tom Smith Cracker Company--

273
00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:00,600
 so Tom Smith was allegedly the person who invented crackers

274
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:01,760
 150 years ago.

275
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:04,680
 And his company became a company as today,

276
00:09:04,680 --> 00:09:06,520
 which still sells a hell of a lot of crackers.

277
00:09:06,520 --> 00:09:08,920
 Person who runs it said in 2005

278
00:09:08,920 --> 00:09:11,320
 that the only changes they've made to any of the jokes

279
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:13,240
 since 1950 is going through every year

280
00:09:13,240 --> 00:09:15,200
 to take out the offensive ones.

281
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:18,760
 So that's why they seem quite dated, yeah.

282
00:09:18,760 --> 00:09:22,440
 She said it's mainly things attacking the Scottish and women.

283
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:24,120
 Not attacking, sorry.

284
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:26,880
 Choshing in a potentially offensive way

285
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:28,400
 about Scottish people and women.

286
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:30,040
 And they go through, extract those.

287
00:09:30,040 --> 00:09:31,880
 That means for years, they were looking at the coffin

288
00:09:31,880 --> 00:09:35,400
 Dracula joke, going, that's good, that's nice.

289
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:36,240
 It's not offensive.

290
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:38,240
 Not offensive.

291
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:41,000
 We should give a shout out to Peter Kimpton, who literally

292
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,160
 wrote the book on crackers.

293
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:44,160
 He's written a book, A History of Christmas Crackers.

294
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:46,600
 And I think he used to work for the Tom Smith Company as well.

295
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:49,240
 So he went, I think he went through the company archives,

296
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:51,040
 because they used to have crackers for everything.

297
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:52,200
 It wasn't just for Christmas.

298
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:54,200
 Or rather, I think they released them at Christmas,

299
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:55,240
 but they were themed every year.

300
00:09:55,240 --> 00:09:58,240
 So for example, in 1882, the crackers

301
00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:01,160
 were featured around the Battle of Tel El Kabir

302
00:10:01,160 --> 00:10:02,720
 in the Anglo-Egyptian War.

303
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:03,720
 That's a theme.

304
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:04,440
 Wow.

305
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:08,160
 In 1904, you had Tom Smith's Russo Japanese War crackers.

306
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:09,480
 I didn't know what was in them.

307
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:11,920
 But they had a lot of these very themed ones.

308
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:14,080
 So they had suffragette ones, had spinster ones,

309
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:16,840
 specifically for spinsters, which included a wedding ring,

310
00:10:16,840 --> 00:10:19,440
 some faded flowers, and some makeup.

311
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:20,080
 Wow.

312
00:10:20,080 --> 00:10:20,640
 Yeah.

313
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:21,360
 That's robbing it in.

314
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:23,360
 What are you going to do with a wedding ring?

315
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:23,720
 You're right.

316
00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:24,480
 Yeah, you're right.

317
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:25,080
 Yeah.

318
00:10:25,080 --> 00:10:25,760
 It is robbing it in.

319
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:26,360
 Yeah.

320
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:28,160
 I even think if you're a spinster who finally

321
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:30,520
 gets lucky at Christmas, manages to almost seduce someone

322
00:10:30,520 --> 00:10:32,240
 and then says, well, I happen to have this wedding ring

323
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:33,920
 from a Christmas cracker.

324
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:36,440
 That might be what puts them right off.

325
00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:38,880
 They also had one for the discovery

326
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:42,400
 of the tomb of Tutankhamun in 1920 or whatever that was.

327
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:45,960
 And in the same year, one that celebrated the Prince Edward's

328
00:10:45,960 --> 00:10:47,480
 World Tour.

329
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:49,680
 And it was advertised with, you've met the prince,

330
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:52,440
 now pull the cracker.

331
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:54,520
 That's so good.

332
00:10:54,520 --> 00:10:57,840
 So this Tom Smith guy, it's a ledge that he invented it.

333
00:10:57,840 --> 00:11:00,200
 And he got the idea when he was in Paris.

334
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:03,920
 And he had seen it was in baguette shots and baguette shots.

335
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:06,560
 Exclusively, they sold baguettes only.

336
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:08,840
 And it was little sweets wrapped up.

337
00:11:08,840 --> 00:11:11,360
 Why were those being sold in baguette shops then?

338
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:12,880
 This is a tiny baguette you've got.

339
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:14,000
 This isn't going to feed the whole family.

340
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,440
 A terrible mix up.

341
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:17,000
 Yeah, they were next to the baguettes.

342
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,280
 They weren't in the baguettes.

343
00:11:18,280 --> 00:11:20,120
 But he saw that and he thought, that looks really interesting.

344
00:11:20,120 --> 00:11:22,520
 Why don't I try and apply that back to my shop back in England?

345
00:11:22,520 --> 00:11:23,480
 He did that.

346
00:11:23,480 --> 00:11:24,920
 It was inspired by the baguette, too.

347
00:11:24,920 --> 00:11:27,280
 Because often you get pulled.

348
00:11:27,280 --> 00:11:28,640
 The tug of war of the baguette.

349
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:31,840
 Yeah, no, but he it's there's a lot of mythology around it, right?

350
00:11:31,840 --> 00:11:33,880
 Because we don't we don't know what the true story is.

351
00:11:33,880 --> 00:11:35,960
 And it sort of evolved over time.

352
00:11:35,960 --> 00:11:38,360
 So the crackling bit was supposedly he was at his house,

353
00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:42,160
 asleep by the fire and a log cracked.

354
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:46,040
 And he woke up and went, my goodness, bangs of expectation.

355
00:11:46,040 --> 00:11:48,920
 And supposedly, which is what they were called for ages.

356
00:11:48,920 --> 00:11:52,040
 I've tried to find that term, bangs of expectation.

357
00:11:52,040 --> 00:11:53,880
 I can't find it before about 1960.

358
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:55,680
 Yes, that's why I mean it seems like mythology, right?

359
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:58,560
 It just kind of appears saying they were originally called

360
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:01,400
 bangs of expectation, but I don't think it's true because they were

361
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:03,880
 definitely called Cossack for a while, weren't they?

362
00:12:03,880 --> 00:12:06,560
 Which was apparently because the crack sounds like a Cossack's whip.

363
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:09,000
 And you do see that, but that's interesting.

364
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:12,560
 Actually, the the the exact wording, according to the myth of him

365
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:17,080
 waking up by the fire, is he yelled, bangs of bonbons as soon as he woke up.

366
00:12:17,080 --> 00:12:22,880
 And then he thought, wow, that would be great inside my weird baguette thing.

367
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:26,000
 And then that evolved into the cracker.

368
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,920
 I'm banned from all the bakeries now, though.

369
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:29,600
 So it was his mythology, wasn't it?

370
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:32,680
 Was it? Yeah, as in he said, I've invented the cracker.

371
00:12:32,680 --> 00:12:34,760
 I'm genius. Here's how I did it.

372
00:12:34,760 --> 00:12:36,800
 And he claimed to be the inventor.

373
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:38,680
 And I think he did invent them, didn't he?

374
00:12:38,680 --> 00:12:40,520
 He did. He definitely did invent them.

375
00:12:40,520 --> 00:12:44,400
 There was someone else around the time who was interviewed by Henry Mayhew,

376
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:47,720
 the journalist in 1850, just before Thomas Smith came along.

377
00:12:47,720 --> 00:12:52,440
 And he was called Gaudente Sparanjapani, which I want him

378
00:12:52,440 --> 00:12:54,320
 to invent of them because of that name.

379
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:58,680
 And so he he was an Italian migrant and he came over and he said he invented them.

380
00:12:58,680 --> 00:13:02,440
 And he actually in the interview by Henry Mayhew, he gives him an Italian accent,

381
00:13:02,440 --> 00:13:06,080
 which I won't. But he said, yes, writes down the Italian accent.

382
00:13:06,080 --> 00:13:09,680
 Yeah, so it's D.E. for the it's dem for them.

383
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:11,480
 Right. It's pretty crude.

384
00:13:11,480 --> 00:13:14,920
 He said, yes, I make detonating crackers and I'm the only man in England

385
00:13:14,920 --> 00:13:16,480
 skillful enough to make them.

386
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:19,640
 It lives in my breast alone, the full entire secret.

387
00:13:19,640 --> 00:13:21,440
 And then he said what they're useful for.

388
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:26,320
 And he said what happens is at parties, the pretty lady pull a sudden bang

389
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:30,440
 and the lady goes, ah, wow.

390
00:13:30,440 --> 00:13:32,280
 Amazing.

391
00:13:32,280 --> 00:13:35,920
 Amazing that he kind of talking about the lady going, ah, and all that.

392
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:38,680
 Because both of his daughters were really prominent suffragettes.

393
00:13:38,680 --> 00:13:40,760
 What made them become prominent suffragettes?

394
00:13:40,760 --> 00:13:43,840
 We may never know that's spooking ladies.

395
00:13:43,840 --> 00:13:49,720
 One of them was Maude Ancliffe, Senate, and she was once imprisoned

396
00:13:49,720 --> 00:13:52,880
 in Holloway for breaking the windows of the offices of the Daily Mail

397
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:55,520
 because they hadn't reported a rally that had happened.

398
00:13:55,520 --> 00:13:59,080
 But in fairness, the newspaper paid her fine in the end and she came out.

399
00:13:59,080 --> 00:14:05,040
 And she was part of a group called Women's Social and Political Union.

400
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:07,600
 But she left them in 1908.

401
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:11,360
 She resigned because she really she thought that the people who were in charge

402
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:13,160
 really weren't doing the job properly.

403
00:14:13,160 --> 00:14:17,320
 And then I found separately that in 1909 they made their first ever

404
00:14:17,320 --> 00:14:21,280
 suffragette Christmas crackers the year after she left.

405
00:14:21,280 --> 00:14:24,040
 That must have been such a slam.

406
00:14:24,040 --> 00:14:26,240
 Oh, that is a real slam because she ran.

407
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:29,000
 She took over the company, Spiranya Pania's company and ran it.

408
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,560
 And I've got a suspicion.

409
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:34,200
 I don't like to cast suspicions on a true feminist, but I think she might have

410
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:37,760
 just pretended to be a suffragette to sell crackers because she used to put

411
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:40,840
 adverts for the cracker company in all the suffragette newspapers.

412
00:14:40,840 --> 00:14:45,480
 Oh, it's a good I mean, it's a good idea because who goes when they see a cracker?

413
00:14:45,480 --> 00:14:47,360
 Women. Where do you find lots of women?

414
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:48,440
 Suffragette rallies.

415
00:14:48,440 --> 00:14:50,360
 It's a marketing genius.

416
00:14:50,360 --> 00:14:52,680
 I've got to imagine if you let off a cracker at a suffragette rally,

417
00:14:52,680 --> 00:14:55,200
 the uproar and the riot that would have broken out.

418
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:58,400
 But actually, isn't that true about the bank that I read somewhere?

419
00:14:58,400 --> 00:15:02,760
 In fact, it was on the Tom Smith website that they used to put them all

420
00:15:02,760 --> 00:15:06,240
 together and pull them and make a massive bank to train soldiers.

421
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:08,360
 What it would be like in war.

422
00:15:08,360 --> 00:15:09,760
 It's on their website.

423
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:10,960
 I mean, that's amazing.

424
00:15:10,960 --> 00:15:11,840
 The Second World War.

425
00:15:11,840 --> 00:15:13,920
 It was where I'm getting used to the sound of gunfire.

426
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:17,800
 You can only imagine how unprepared you would be for D Day.

427
00:15:17,800 --> 00:15:21,200
 Calling around the beach is looking for your paper crown.

428
00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:24,720
 Wait for the joke. Wait for the joke.

429
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:26,720
 Who played?

430
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:31,240
 We've got to move on shortly.

431
00:15:31,240 --> 00:15:34,000
 Oh, can I tell you about a giant cracker very quickly?

432
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:37,000
 It's from. Oh, man, I think it's around the turn of the century.

433
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:40,800
 So the around 1900, the Smith factory, they made an eight foot cracker,

434
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:45,160
 which was to be pulled by a group of clowns led by the famous Harry Payne

435
00:15:45,160 --> 00:15:46,800
 at the Drury Lane pantomime.

436
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:48,200
 It contained various things.

437
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:51,200
 So the sources all differ because it was meant to be reused every night.

438
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:54,920
 But it apparently contained a costume change for the whole cast inside the cracker.

439
00:15:54,920 --> 00:15:58,480
 Several hundred smaller crackers, which were then handed out to the children

440
00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:01,400
 in the audience. And then other sources say there was just a person inside

441
00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:05,360
 the cracker, a sort of child who just burst out of the cracker and started doing something.

442
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:08,960
 Wow. But yeah, that's very dangerous because you risk snapping the child

443
00:16:08,960 --> 00:16:12,400
 right in half, but useful if you're a spinster,

444
00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:14,400
 because you have a child without having to get married.

445
00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:20,600
 Spinsters in the audience, spinsters night at Drury Lane.

446
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:25,960
 I've actually just got I got one last thing before we move on,

447
00:16:25,960 --> 00:16:28,960
 which is that the crackers that I was talking about this joke committee

448
00:16:28,960 --> 00:16:30,680
 was run by Julian Reed.

449
00:16:30,680 --> 00:16:34,760
 So Julian Reed started this in 1975 when he was a young schoolboy.

450
00:16:34,760 --> 00:16:35,760
 He was obsessed over it.

451
00:16:35,760 --> 00:16:39,200
 He got a two pound fifty cracker kit and he made his own crackers

452
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:42,240
 and he started making them himself and he started selling them to local shops,

453
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:43,640
 built it up and built it up.

454
00:16:43,640 --> 00:16:48,680
 And he's become this guy who 40 Christmases later is still making crackers

455
00:16:48,680 --> 00:16:50,680
 for the country over 10 million go over.

456
00:16:50,680 --> 00:16:56,320
 So I actually emailed him to say, can you give me any extra facts about crackers?

457
00:16:56,320 --> 00:16:59,120
 Some of the stuff that I've already said about the committee and rejecting.

458
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:02,880
 But what he's also done is he has read out to me

459
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:05,520
 some of the jokes that made it through the committee this year.

460
00:17:05,800 --> 00:17:09,040
 That will be appearing in this year's Christmas crackers.

461
00:17:09,040 --> 00:17:11,680
 If you get a Robin Reed, you're going to hear a minute.

462
00:17:11,680 --> 00:17:14,080
 So this goes out actually that day before Christmas.

463
00:17:14,080 --> 00:17:16,560
 So spoiler alert, spoiler alert.

464
00:17:16,560 --> 00:17:18,360
 Yeah, yeah. So, yeah, apologies.

465
00:17:18,360 --> 00:17:20,600
 I really hope he reads out the con medicine one.

466
00:17:20,600 --> 00:17:25,720
 I really hope because who plays Edward Scissorhunt.

467
00:17:25,720 --> 00:17:30,760
 So we've become we've become WhatsApp buddies and he's been sending me voice memos.

468
00:17:30,760 --> 00:17:34,920
 So here here are a few of the jokes that will be appearing in this year's crackers.

469
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:38,080
 This is Julian Reed, founder of Robin Reed crackers.

470
00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:41,120
 Why did the doughnut seller retire?

471
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:43,560
 He was fed up with the whole business.

472
00:17:43,560 --> 00:17:48,280
 What is the best thing about deadly snakes?

473
00:17:48,280 --> 00:17:51,320
 They've got poisonality.

474
00:17:51,320 --> 00:17:56,400
 What do you call a man with a seagull on his head?

475
00:17:56,400 --> 00:18:00,760
 Cliff got it.

476
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:04,440
 That's from the voice of the jokes of crackers.

477
00:18:04,440 --> 00:18:06,520
 That amazing.

478
00:18:06,520 --> 00:18:10,200
 Anyway, thank you to Julian for that, and we need to move on to our next fact.

479
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:14,960
 So it is time for fact number two, and that is Anna.

480
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:21,040
 My fact this week is that in the 1880s to defend against attacks on nativity scenes,

481
00:18:21,040 --> 00:18:24,760
 one priest issued knuckle dusters to his congregation.

482
00:18:24,760 --> 00:18:30,560
 Wow, things got pretty heated round about this time.

483
00:18:30,840 --> 00:18:34,880
 So this was there were a lot of riots going on round about this time

484
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:37,200
 in the UK from anti-papers.

485
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:39,560
 So basically, a lot of people felt like the Anglican church

486
00:18:39,560 --> 00:18:42,440
 was creeping back towards Catholicism and the Pope

487
00:18:42,440 --> 00:18:45,080
 and doing all sorts of things like putting decorations up

488
00:18:45,080 --> 00:18:48,680
 and doing weird blessings and worshipping idols and, you know,

489
00:18:48,680 --> 00:18:52,360
 all that fun frivolous stuff that the Protestant church didn't really like.

490
00:18:52,360 --> 00:18:54,880
 And so when, for instance, people put up

491
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:59,120
 nativity scenes and did this big ceremony called the blessing of the crib,

492
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:02,280
 they were often vandalised and people used to get quite violent.

493
00:19:02,280 --> 00:19:06,600
 And so there was a priest who issued knuckle dusters.

494
00:19:06,600 --> 00:19:09,000
 And you can actually see them if you go to Clevedon court,

495
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:12,280
 which is in Somerset, I think, one of the knuckle dusters is on display

496
00:19:12,280 --> 00:19:15,520
 that he issued to the people of the state at home to say,

497
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:18,000
 look, if they start trying to tear down your nativity,

498
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:21,800
 you have my blessing and God's blessing to crack him in the soul.

499
00:19:21,800 --> 00:19:26,400
 Yeah, I mean, he must have been able to source loads of knuckle dusters,

500
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:27,680
 which is quite impressive.

501
00:19:27,680 --> 00:19:30,000
 You had a lot of knuckle dusters around in those days.

502
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,360
 They were a bit more common.

503
00:19:31,360 --> 00:19:33,880
 Were they? Yeah, I used to make them out of coins.

504
00:19:33,880 --> 00:19:36,720
 I used to, like, make holes in coins and then put them together

505
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:40,680
 and you'd be able to give someone a bunch of fives. Nice.

506
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:43,480
 And so do we know if they were used in a big battle?

507
00:19:43,480 --> 00:19:44,880
 I don't have any. I don't know.

508
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:47,680
 It was a big battle because I found a few big battles.

509
00:19:47,680 --> 00:19:52,800
 So one of the main offenders of people who wanted to stop

510
00:19:52,800 --> 00:19:56,920
 all these processions and stuff was a guy called SB Andrew, who was in Manchester.

511
00:19:57,560 --> 00:20:01,080
 And I was reading a story about him in the British newspaper archives.

512
00:20:01,080 --> 00:20:05,280
 And this was in the sun in Thursday, the 5th of January, 1871.

513
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:08,040
 And apparently there was a procession going round

514
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:11,640
 and he tried to stop them from walking around with this cross.

515
00:20:11,640 --> 00:20:13,520
 And he just stopped them and stopped them and stopped them.

516
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:15,040
 And eventually they went round.

517
00:20:15,040 --> 00:20:18,000
 And then the next day they've been trying to put decorations up.

518
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:19,920
 And then he'd take the decorations down

519
00:20:19,920 --> 00:20:22,640
 and then he put the decorations up again and then he'd take them down

520
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:24,320
 and they put them up again and he'd take them down.

521
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:28,960
 And eventually there was a massive brawl between all these kind of church people.

522
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:32,800
 And they called the police and the police came, a whole load of police came,

523
00:20:32,800 --> 00:20:35,560
 but they said that they had no authority inside the church.

524
00:20:35,560 --> 00:20:37,800
 So all they could do was sit outside the church

525
00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:40,840
 while everyone was having a massive scrap in his face.

526
00:20:40,840 --> 00:20:43,320
 And eventually no one came out, so they just left.

527
00:20:43,320 --> 00:20:46,320
 But this guy did get arrested and find five pounds.

528
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:47,880
 Wow.

529
00:20:47,880 --> 00:20:52,200
 Yeah, so Nativity Thefts, modern day Nativity Thefts

530
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:55,040
 and anyone trying to tamper with it is a big deal in America.

531
00:20:55,040 --> 00:20:58,160
 It's got to the point where churches have been fitting baby Jesus

532
00:20:58,160 --> 00:21:01,280
 with GPS tracking systems because people come in

533
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:03,640
 and they steal the baby Jesus and they wander off.

534
00:21:03,640 --> 00:21:07,080
 And a lot of people, A, find it upset that baby Jesus is missing,

535
00:21:07,080 --> 00:21:09,080
 but B, some of them are really expensive.

536
00:21:09,080 --> 00:21:11,080
 So there was one church, which is in Florida,

537
00:21:11,080 --> 00:21:18,360
 which had a life-size ceramic Jesus, which was 1,350 pounds.

538
00:21:18,360 --> 00:21:21,520
 Done. Sorry, pretty hard to tell.

539
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:24,240
 That's right.

540
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:28,080
 Yeah, so it was very expensive and they wandered off with it,

541
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:31,640
 but it was a GPS tracking system, which as soon as there's movement in Jesus,

542
00:21:31,640 --> 00:21:33,440
 it sets off and it starts going.

543
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:36,320
 And so you can silently follow without the people knowing

544
00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:37,760
 that there's the GPS in there.

545
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:41,640
 And he was found face-down on a carpet of a woman, so they find her.

546
00:21:41,640 --> 00:21:44,600
 Sorry, repeat that sentence, but better.

547
00:21:44,600 --> 00:21:47,840
 Face-down in the carpets of a woman.

548
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:53,960
 So he was found in a nearby house, leg face-down on a carpet, not dead.

549
00:21:53,960 --> 00:21:55,160
 He was ceramic.

550
00:21:55,160 --> 00:21:57,160
 It's just something about saying in the carpet of a woman,

551
00:21:57,160 --> 00:21:59,960
 which I'm just absolutely fouled.

552
00:21:59,960 --> 00:22:00,960
 Oh dear.

553
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:01,960
 Too sexy for a cracker joke?

554
00:22:01,960 --> 00:22:03,760
 I think it's been banned, yeah.

555
00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:06,760
 Do you know where Benedict Cumberbatch's first role was

556
00:22:06,760 --> 00:22:08,760
 in a school nativity play, like a lot of people?

557
00:22:08,760 --> 00:22:12,840
 Yeah, apparently he pushed Mary off stage because she was talking too long.

558
00:22:12,840 --> 00:22:16,160
 Wow. He still does that. It's really awkward.

559
00:22:16,160 --> 00:22:18,480
 The outtakes for Sherlock are insane.

560
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:22,360
 I'm the first nativity ever, I don't think we've mentioned,

561
00:22:22,360 --> 00:22:25,560
 but it was made by a friend of the podcast in Francis of Assisi.

562
00:22:25,560 --> 00:22:26,560
 Oh.

563
00:22:26,560 --> 00:22:28,360
 He's going to guess who, yeah.

564
00:22:28,360 --> 00:22:29,360
 Oh, sorry.

565
00:22:29,360 --> 00:22:30,760
 Friend of the podcast, who could it be?

566
00:22:30,760 --> 00:22:32,360
 Oh, I want to know who you would have guessed now.

567
00:22:32,360 --> 00:22:33,360
 Everard Digby.

568
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:34,360
 Everard Digby.

569
00:22:34,360 --> 00:22:35,360
 So sad.

570
00:22:35,360 --> 00:22:36,560
 William Haslet, I would have gone for it.

571
00:22:36,560 --> 00:22:37,560
 William Haslet.

572
00:22:37,560 --> 00:22:39,040
 Julian Reed, off cracker face.

573
00:22:39,040 --> 00:22:41,040
 Julian Reed.

574
00:22:41,040 --> 00:22:44,480
 Imagine, whenever people say, "What's your ideal dinner party?"

575
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:47,880
 I would always say, definitely William Haslet.

576
00:22:47,880 --> 00:22:50,640
 Everard Digby, a Julian of cracker fame.

577
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:52,840
 Just to keep the conversation spicy.

578
00:22:52,840 --> 00:22:55,680
 He could lob another one in anytime.

579
00:22:55,680 --> 00:22:57,640
 If anyone loves Julian Banzit.

580
00:22:57,640 --> 00:23:01,440
 No, it was St. Francis, a friend of the podcast.

581
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:05,840
 And he set up the first nativity scene in a little Italian town in 1223.

582
00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:11,320
 And he made this manger and he got a doll that he cradled as he gave mass.

583
00:23:11,320 --> 00:23:14,240
 And apparently the doll, so this is what's meant to happen in nativities,

584
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:17,880
 the doll rose from its eternal sleep, as dolls are usually in,

585
00:23:17,880 --> 00:23:21,160
 and cried real tears of joy, which obviously didn't happen.

586
00:23:21,160 --> 00:23:22,160
 And then people...

587
00:23:22,160 --> 00:23:23,960
 I mean, that sounds like Pinocchio.

588
00:23:23,960 --> 00:23:28,880
 Dolls on in an eternal sleep, they're just not alive.

589
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:31,320
 Well, don't ruin... I mean, there might be kids watching.

590
00:23:31,320 --> 00:23:32,320
 Isn't that what you tell your children?

591
00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:33,320
 Oh, bloody hope not.

592
00:23:33,320 --> 00:23:37,960
 Wait, I think that's spoiling all of religion,

593
00:23:37,960 --> 00:23:40,120
 which is... That's a different kettle of fish, I think.

594
00:23:40,120 --> 00:23:41,120
 That's too big.

595
00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:42,120
 The doll woke up.

596
00:23:42,120 --> 00:23:46,200
 Imagine if you're a doll and you wake up and you're face down in a woman's carpet,

597
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:47,200
 that would be surprising.

598
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:51,120
 I think this is probably quite dramatic for the doll as well.

599
00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:53,680
 Swat team with a tracker making their way into the room.

600
00:23:53,680 --> 00:23:55,480
 There he is. Secure the asset.

601
00:23:55,480 --> 00:23:56,960
 And you got a messiah complex.

602
00:23:56,960 --> 00:23:58,720
 It'd be very weird.

603
00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:02,440
 Sorry, Anna, you were saying about St. Francis of Assisi.

604
00:24:02,440 --> 00:24:05,080
 Look, I was mostly done, but it is the case.

605
00:24:05,080 --> 00:24:07,640
 I think it's more true that apparently Francis himself

606
00:24:07,640 --> 00:24:10,440
 was so moved by the mass that he himself was giving

607
00:24:10,440 --> 00:24:13,160
 that as he spoke the word Bethlehem during it,

608
00:24:13,160 --> 00:24:15,560
 his voice sounded like the bleeding of a lamb.

609
00:24:15,560 --> 00:24:18,360
 I didn't know that was what happened when you were very moved by something.

610
00:24:18,360 --> 00:24:19,360
 Bethlehem.

611
00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:20,360
 Bethlehem.

612
00:24:20,360 --> 00:24:21,960
 Bethlehem.

613
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:22,960
 There you go.

614
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:23,960
 Very powerful.

615
00:24:23,960 --> 00:24:25,360
 Weird thing to record.

616
00:24:25,360 --> 00:24:27,560
 Weird, like, weird detail to record about that.

617
00:24:27,560 --> 00:24:31,920
 Was it his diary? Did he say, "I was so good in the mass today

618
00:24:31,920 --> 00:24:33,320
 "that I sounded like a sheep"?

619
00:24:33,320 --> 00:24:37,160
 I don't know. I think his mate wrote the diary.

620
00:24:37,160 --> 00:24:39,640
 I do actually have an nativity sheep fact.

621
00:24:39,640 --> 00:24:40,640
 Come on.

622
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:43,080
 It's a nativity sheep and dolls, actually, so it really works.

623
00:24:43,080 --> 00:24:44,640
 It's a story from 2018.

624
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:46,880
 The sourcing is impeccable, Metro,

625
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:49,960
 but it is Amazon has pulled a sheep sex doll from its website

626
00:24:49,960 --> 00:24:52,920
 after a mum accidentally bought it for her son's nativity play.

627
00:24:52,920 --> 00:24:56,520
 It was so, OK.

628
00:24:56,520 --> 00:24:58,640
 I don't really know much about sheep sex dolls,

629
00:24:58,640 --> 00:25:00,320
 but I reckon you could get away with it, couldn't you?

630
00:25:00,320 --> 00:25:03,240
 Well, I know. So it's a joke gag gift, right?

631
00:25:03,240 --> 00:25:07,600
 It was called a stag night bonkin sheep,

632
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:12,280
 and it has a big... How did she not realise when she was answering it?

633
00:25:12,280 --> 00:25:15,440
 I think it was sort of those customers also bought things,

634
00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:18,840
 because she bought a Joseph outfit, and it was also more...

635
00:25:18,840 --> 00:25:23,640
 So anyway, she sent her son to school with the doll blown up,

636
00:25:23,640 --> 00:25:27,720
 but it had a really big hole at the back end, and it was, you know...

637
00:25:27,720 --> 00:25:30,760
 Anyway, I'm surprised the teachers knew what it was, really,

638
00:25:30,760 --> 00:25:34,880
 but they refused to use it. They sent the boy home, and the woman added...

639
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:36,840
 They sent the boy home!

640
00:25:36,840 --> 00:25:38,320
 They kept the sheep.

641
00:25:38,320 --> 00:25:41,120
 That's harsh, because they can't have said...

642
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:43,560
 If this is a young... It was a young boy, yeah.

643
00:25:43,560 --> 00:25:46,000
 A seven-year-old boy, and you send them home

644
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:49,680
 because they've done something wrong, you can't say the reason I'm sending you home

645
00:25:49,680 --> 00:25:55,080
 is because this inflatable sheep is normally had sex with my people, can you?

646
00:25:55,080 --> 00:25:57,000
 And that kid doesn't know what's happening.

647
00:25:57,000 --> 00:26:00,800
 No, I know. Well, she added her son had become really attached to it

648
00:26:00,800 --> 00:26:02,920
 and really liked it, and she said...

649
00:26:02,920 --> 00:26:05,840
 She said, "No, for heaven's sake, no."

650
00:26:05,840 --> 00:26:09,920
 She said, "He's probably in his room right now, stuffing Lego in the hole."

651
00:26:09,920 --> 00:26:11,920
 Wow.

652
00:26:11,920 --> 00:26:15,920
 I'm so sorry.

653
00:26:15,920 --> 00:26:19,920
 - Wow. - See, we do some Francis. We do this stuff.

654
00:26:19,920 --> 00:26:23,920
 It's lowbrow to highbrow, highbrow to lowbrow here, isn't it?

655
00:26:23,920 --> 00:26:28,560
 Do you know who is very pro Christian Christmas, the Merry Christmas?

656
00:26:28,560 --> 00:26:30,080
 - Christians. - The Pope.

657
00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:34,600
 Yeah, all correct. I should have closed the field a bit there.

658
00:26:34,600 --> 00:26:38,600
 Are you reading this from your cracker trivia?

659
00:26:38,600 --> 00:26:41,600
 - Someone you wouldn't expect. Richard Dawkins. - OK.

660
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:43,600
 Richard Dawkins, very pro Christmas.

661
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:45,600
 We found this out in an article that he wrote.

662
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:47,600
 It was a letter, actually, in the new statesman that was published,

663
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:52,600
 written as an open letter to David Cameron in which he wishes him Merry Christmas,

664
00:26:52,600 --> 00:26:55,600
 adding that he would not accept substitutes to that.

665
00:26:55,600 --> 00:26:57,600
 No happy holidays, no nothing.

666
00:26:57,600 --> 00:27:01,600
 He said, "All that happy holiday season stuff with holiday cards and holiday presents

667
00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:03,600
 is a tiresome import from the United States

668
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:07,600
 where it has long been fostered more by rival religions than atheists."

669
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:11,600
 As a cultural Anglican, so he kind of puts himself as that.

670
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:14,600
 He says, "I recoil from such secular carols

671
00:27:14,600 --> 00:27:16,600
 as White Christmas, Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer

672
00:27:16,600 --> 00:27:19,600
 and the loathsome Jingle Bells, but I am happy to sing real carols.

673
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:22,600
 And in the unlikely event that anyone wants me to read a lesson,

674
00:27:22,600 --> 00:27:26,600
 I'll gladly oblige, only from the King James version, of course."

675
00:27:26,600 --> 00:27:28,600
 - Jesus Christ. - Who's there?

676
00:27:28,600 --> 00:27:32,600
 Was David Cameron like, "Didn't even invite you, mate?"

677
00:27:32,600 --> 00:27:35,600
 No, he's not on anyone's dinner party list, is he?

678
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:37,600
 - Dawkins or Cameron? - Dawkins.

679
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:39,600
 I'd be fun. Him and Julian.

680
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:42,600
 Dan, did you listen to the quote that you just read?

681
00:27:42,600 --> 00:27:45,600
 He's pro-classic. Oh, no, I'm modern. What am I talking about?

682
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:47,600
 Yeah, I love Rudolph.

683
00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:50,600
 So, you know, people are always saying, are they, that Christmas,

684
00:27:50,600 --> 00:27:53,600
 you know, it's not quite as religious as it should be.

685
00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:57,600
 There's someone who said, "This festival teaches even the little children

686
00:27:57,600 --> 00:28:00,600
 "that are heartless and simple to be greedy.

687
00:28:00,600 --> 00:28:03,600
 "The tender minds of the young begin to be impressed

688
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:06,600
 "with that which is commercial and sordid."

689
00:28:06,600 --> 00:28:10,600
 And that was written by Cappadocia and Bishop Asterius of Amasea

690
00:28:10,600 --> 00:28:12,600
 in 400 A.D.

691
00:28:12,600 --> 00:28:14,600
 - Wow. - That was amazing.

692
00:28:14,600 --> 00:28:17,600
 What was Saint Augustine as well, and a bit later than that,

693
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:20,600
 but not much, he was saying that, "Stop giving people gifts.

694
00:28:20,600 --> 00:28:22,600
 "You need to give people alms instead.

695
00:28:22,600 --> 00:28:24,600
 "You need to give to charity. Stop giving gifts."

696
00:28:24,600 --> 00:28:26,600
 That was right at the start, because at the start,

697
00:28:26,600 --> 00:28:28,600
 they didn't really celebrate Christmas, Christians,

698
00:28:28,600 --> 00:28:31,600
 because in early Christianity, you wouldn't celebrate birthdays

699
00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:33,600
 because it was kind of a pagan thing.

700
00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:36,600
 And so to celebrate Jesus' birthday was just ridiculous.

701
00:28:36,600 --> 00:28:38,600
 So it was quite late when they did it, and even then,

702
00:28:38,600 --> 00:28:40,600
 they were already saying, "This is too commercial."

703
00:28:40,600 --> 00:28:42,600
 What? I mean, were there any shops?

704
00:28:42,600 --> 00:28:46,600
 But I was just trying to envisage 400 A.D. shops, though.

705
00:28:46,600 --> 00:28:48,600
 Sort of what you would give someone.

706
00:28:48,600 --> 00:28:49,600
 There wasn't wrapping paper.

707
00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:51,600
 There will have been, like, baguette shops, wouldn't there?

708
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:54,600
 So I've always been exclusive baguette shops.

709
00:28:54,600 --> 00:28:56,600
 We've got to move on to our next fact, guys.

710
00:28:56,600 --> 00:28:58,600
 Can I give you another? Just quick.

711
00:28:58,600 --> 00:29:02,600
 Just it's people who don't like Christmas.

712
00:29:02,600 --> 00:29:04,600
 So YouGov does a lot of surveying of people,

713
00:29:04,600 --> 00:29:06,600
 and they ask all sorts of Christmassy questions.

714
00:29:06,600 --> 00:29:09,600
 So there was a survey recently, and they sort of matched people

715
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:11,600
 who don't like Christmas with all the other attributes

716
00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:14,600
 that they know about all the people on their database.

717
00:29:14,600 --> 00:29:17,600
 So people who don't like Christmas are more likely to say,

718
00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:19,600
 "There's no point in getting married.

719
00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:22,600
 Over half of marriages end in divorce anyway."

720
00:29:22,600 --> 00:29:23,600
 They're more likely to say,

721
00:29:23,600 --> 00:29:25,600
 "I think the Olympics is more financial trouble

722
00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:27,600
 to a city than it's worth."

723
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:29,600
 And they're also more likely to say,

724
00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:33,600
 "I don't understand what many emojis mean."

725
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:38,600
 Did they only interview Richard Dawkins?

726
00:29:38,600 --> 00:29:43,600
 OK, it is time for fact number three, and that is Andy.

727
00:29:43,600 --> 00:29:45,600
 My fact is that when asked this year,

728
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:48,600
 21% of people said they didn't want Christmas carol singers

729
00:29:48,600 --> 00:29:51,600
 visiting their home because of coronavirus.

730
00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:54,600
 Another 55% said they didn't want carol singers

731
00:29:54,600 --> 00:29:58,600
 regardless of coronavirus.

732
00:29:58,600 --> 00:30:02,600
 Maybe those 21% were slightly using the COVID as an excuse,

733
00:30:02,600 --> 00:30:05,600
 but it seems that people just don't want carol singers.

734
00:30:05,600 --> 00:30:06,600
 No, they hate them.

735
00:30:06,600 --> 00:30:09,600
 I mean, I like the sound of carols.

736
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:11,600
 Would you guys say you didn't want?

737
00:30:11,600 --> 00:30:13,600
 I would say I do want, yeah.

738
00:30:13,600 --> 00:30:16,600
 I would say that this year I haven't really opened my door

739
00:30:16,600 --> 00:30:20,600
 to anyone other than an Amazon delivery guy.

740
00:30:20,600 --> 00:30:22,600
 If he was singing at the same time,

741
00:30:22,600 --> 00:30:24,600
 you wouldn't keep the door closed.

742
00:30:24,600 --> 00:30:26,600
 I've actually become quite good friends with that

743
00:30:26,600 --> 00:30:28,600
 by Amazon delivery guy now.

744
00:30:28,600 --> 00:30:32,600
 Another blow-up sheet, Mr. Harden.

745
00:30:32,600 --> 00:30:36,600
 Yeah, only 13% of people surveyed actively wanted carolers,

746
00:30:36,600 --> 00:30:38,600
 and the math doesn't quite add up,

747
00:30:38,600 --> 00:30:41,600
 but 11% were in the "don't know" camp, a bit indecisive.

748
00:30:41,600 --> 00:30:42,600
 Wow.

749
00:30:42,600 --> 00:30:44,600
 There is a bit of a weird thing of if you're the only audience

750
00:30:44,600 --> 00:30:46,600
 standing there at your front door.

751
00:30:46,600 --> 00:30:47,600
 It's awkward.

752
00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:48,600
 It is awkward.

753
00:30:48,600 --> 00:30:51,600
 Oh, come on, you've done Edinburgh shows like that.

754
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:54,600
 We're literally doing a show with that one at the audience.

755
00:30:54,600 --> 00:30:57,600
 What I wouldn't give for one audience member right now.

756
00:30:57,600 --> 00:31:00,600
 There is a thing where people don't like them,

757
00:31:00,600 --> 00:31:03,600
 and there was kind of uproar in 2009.

758
00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:06,600
 There was this thing, it was in a place just opposite Preston,

759
00:31:06,600 --> 00:31:09,600
 where Neighborhood Watch distributed these cards.

760
00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:11,600
 They put them through people's letterboxes,

761
00:31:11,600 --> 00:31:13,600
 and they gave them out in cafes and pubs and stuff.

762
00:31:13,600 --> 00:31:15,600
 And there were cards you can put in your window saying,

763
00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:18,600
 "Carol singers would not welcome that house."

764
00:31:18,600 --> 00:31:20,600
 I'm asking if there was one person that I could stay

765
00:31:20,600 --> 00:31:22,600
 called "carol singer."

766
00:31:22,600 --> 00:31:23,600
 It would feel awful.

767
00:31:23,600 --> 00:31:26,600
 She lives with Bill Stickers, I believe.

768
00:31:26,600 --> 00:31:28,600
 Jesus.

769
00:31:28,600 --> 00:31:30,600
 I actually was looking up "carol singers"

770
00:31:30,600 --> 00:31:33,600
 in the newspaper archive, British newspaper archive,

771
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:35,600
 and the only one I could find was a carol singer

772
00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:37,600
 who was brutally murdered about 100 years ago,

773
00:31:37,600 --> 00:31:39,600
 which really ruined my search terms.

774
00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:42,600
 Well, to be fair, there were two separate editions.

775
00:31:42,600 --> 00:31:45,600
 We do search the newspaper archive for "carol singer shot."

776
00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:48,600
 There were twice that that did happen in history,

777
00:31:48,600 --> 00:31:49,600
 30 years apart.

778
00:31:49,600 --> 00:31:52,600
 One was in 1916 in Newcastle.

779
00:31:52,600 --> 00:31:55,600
 There was a guy called John Nixon who shot someone

780
00:31:55,600 --> 00:31:57,600
 who was carol singing outside his house.

781
00:31:57,600 --> 00:31:59,600
 Apparently they were kind of friends,

782
00:31:59,600 --> 00:32:00,600
 and they might have been...

783
00:32:00,600 --> 00:32:02,600
 I think he might have owned a pub,

784
00:32:02,600 --> 00:32:03,600
 or he'd owned somewhere near a pub,

785
00:32:03,600 --> 00:32:05,600
 and they'd been drinking earlier that day,

786
00:32:05,600 --> 00:32:07,600
 and then they decided to carol sing,

787
00:32:07,600 --> 00:32:08,600
 and then he decided to shoot them.

788
00:32:08,600 --> 00:32:10,600
 Wait, so were they singing together?

789
00:32:10,600 --> 00:32:13,600
 No, they were singing at his property.

790
00:32:13,600 --> 00:32:16,600
 And then another one in 1886,

791
00:32:16,600 --> 00:32:19,600
 the rising sun in Clapham was a pub,

792
00:32:19,600 --> 00:32:21,600
 and again, the landlord shot someone

793
00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:23,600
 because they were carol singing.

794
00:32:23,600 --> 00:32:25,600
 So it's a very dangerous, dangerous thing

795
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:29,600
 if you're in the turn of the 19th, 20th century.

796
00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:30,600
 Wow.

797
00:32:30,600 --> 00:32:32,600
 It's weird how the hatred goes back a long way.

798
00:32:32,600 --> 00:32:34,600
 So if you look them up, in 1906,

799
00:32:34,600 --> 00:32:36,600
 the leading article across the papers,

800
00:32:36,600 --> 00:32:38,600
 there was this big thing about whether carol singing

801
00:32:38,600 --> 00:32:41,600
 was a very annoying, and they should be banned altogether.

802
00:32:41,600 --> 00:32:44,600
 And there was a piece written, like a leader piece,

803
00:32:44,600 --> 00:32:45,600
 in, like, the...

804
00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:48,600
 I think the Bexhill on Sea newspaper or something saying,

805
00:32:48,600 --> 00:32:50,600
 "We love carol singers. This is really unfair."

806
00:32:50,600 --> 00:32:52,600
 And it published the letters it got in response,

807
00:32:52,600 --> 00:32:53,600
 and they were furious.

808
00:32:53,600 --> 00:32:55,600
 So it got all these letters in response to it,

809
00:32:55,600 --> 00:32:56,600
 publishing this thing saying,

810
00:32:56,600 --> 00:32:58,600
 "Look, carol singers are harmless, surely."

811
00:32:58,600 --> 00:32:59,600
 One of them said,

812
00:32:59,600 --> 00:33:02,600
 "I don't think the writer kind of experienced firsthand

813
00:33:02,600 --> 00:33:04,600
 the bands of carol singers so called

814
00:33:04,600 --> 00:33:07,600
 that have visited this town the past few Christmases."

815
00:33:07,600 --> 00:33:09,600
 Another, and this is 1906,

816
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:11,600
 said, "Most of us who have experienced it

817
00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:13,600
 would be inclined to call it not carol singing,

818
00:33:13,600 --> 00:33:16,600
 but carol howling or carol murdering."

819
00:33:16,600 --> 00:33:17,600
 Wow.

820
00:33:17,600 --> 00:33:20,600
 And that was only 20 years after there had been a carol murder.

821
00:33:20,600 --> 00:33:21,600
 So that's pretty insensitive.

822
00:33:21,600 --> 00:33:22,600
 It really is.

823
00:33:22,600 --> 00:33:24,600
 1887, in the Essex Newsman,

824
00:33:24,600 --> 00:33:26,600
 someone said, "The singer's antics

825
00:33:26,600 --> 00:33:29,600
 were little better than Rowdy Burlesque,

826
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:32,600
 drunken or half-drunken orgies."

827
00:33:32,600 --> 00:33:34,600
 That sounds quite good, actually.

828
00:33:34,600 --> 00:33:36,600
 It's quite something to open your door to.

829
00:33:36,600 --> 00:33:37,600
 You're expecting silent night.

830
00:33:37,600 --> 00:33:39,600
 Just singing while Shepard's watched

831
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:42,600
 while you twirl your nipple pasting.

832
00:33:42,600 --> 00:33:44,600
 So it seems to be a thing of Christmas music.

833
00:33:44,600 --> 00:33:46,600
 It's another thing people really don't like

834
00:33:46,600 --> 00:33:47,600
 when it's too early.

835
00:33:47,600 --> 00:33:48,600
 So another survey,

836
00:33:48,600 --> 00:33:50,600
 "Do you enjoy hearing Christmas music

837
00:33:50,600 --> 00:33:51,600
 a month before Christmas?"

838
00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:53,600
 So November 25th, "Are you up for it?"

839
00:33:53,600 --> 00:33:55,600
 4% said, "Yes, I'm up for it."

840
00:33:55,600 --> 00:33:57,600
 The other 96% were not up for it.

841
00:33:57,600 --> 00:33:59,600
 Or maybe they would don't know, as I know.

842
00:33:59,600 --> 00:34:00,600
 But 5% of people surveyed

843
00:34:00,600 --> 00:34:02,600
 didn't want to hear Christmas music

844
00:34:02,600 --> 00:34:04,600
 until the 24th of December.

845
00:34:04,600 --> 00:34:05,600
 What?

846
00:34:05,600 --> 00:34:06,600
 5% surveyed.

847
00:34:06,600 --> 00:34:07,600
 More than we're happy to hear it

848
00:34:07,600 --> 00:34:09,600
 in the end of November.

849
00:34:09,600 --> 00:34:10,600
 Nothing until the day before.

850
00:34:10,600 --> 00:34:12,600
 Do you remember when you guys were in Australia

851
00:34:12,600 --> 00:34:14,600
 with me for the tour, for fish,

852
00:34:14,600 --> 00:34:15,600
 and we went to my parents' house,

853
00:34:15,600 --> 00:34:18,600
 and it was, I think, May or something like that?

854
00:34:18,600 --> 00:34:21,600
 The only thing my dad played was Christmas music.

855
00:34:21,600 --> 00:34:22,600
 Is that right?

856
00:34:22,600 --> 00:34:23,600
 Yeah, do you not remember?

857
00:34:23,600 --> 00:34:25,600
 I remember the day, but I don't remember the music.

858
00:34:25,600 --> 00:34:26,600
 It was a lovely day.

859
00:34:26,600 --> 00:34:27,600
 It was a lovely day,

860
00:34:27,600 --> 00:34:28,600
 and it was probably made better

861
00:34:28,600 --> 00:34:29,600
 because of the Christmas carols.

862
00:34:29,600 --> 00:34:30,600
 But for some reason,

863
00:34:30,600 --> 00:34:32,600
 the only playlist that was coming up was...

864
00:34:32,600 --> 00:34:33,600
 Do you know what?

865
00:34:33,600 --> 00:34:34,600
 I remembered why they did that.

866
00:34:34,600 --> 00:34:36,600
 Well, I remembered why we were at your parents' house.

867
00:34:36,600 --> 00:34:37,600
 It was my birthday,

868
00:34:37,600 --> 00:34:39,600
 and we went there as a special birthday treat to celebrate.

869
00:34:39,600 --> 00:34:42,600
 So they must equate me with the Messiah, I suppose.

870
00:34:42,600 --> 00:34:45,600
 Ah, the ceramic one, or...

871
00:34:45,600 --> 00:34:47,600
 Be fair, you were faced down in a car

872
00:34:47,600 --> 00:34:49,600
 quite early on in the day.

873
00:34:49,600 --> 00:34:53,600
 They had a reputation for being raunchy, though.

874
00:34:53,600 --> 00:34:55,600
 They were banned by the church multiple times,

875
00:34:55,600 --> 00:34:59,600
 and medieval Christmases were generally really, like, raucous,

876
00:34:59,600 --> 00:35:02,600
 and it was the 12 days where, basically,

877
00:35:02,600 --> 00:35:04,600
 all one big pagan drunken mess.

878
00:35:04,600 --> 00:35:06,600
 And a lot of the carols,

879
00:35:06,600 --> 00:35:07,600
 like Holly and the Ivy,

880
00:35:07,600 --> 00:35:09,600
 was actually a pagan fertility dance, they think,

881
00:35:09,600 --> 00:35:10,600
 or related to it,

882
00:35:10,600 --> 00:35:12,600
 so it would be accompanied by dance moves.

883
00:35:12,600 --> 00:35:13,600
 And I've read things that say

884
00:35:13,600 --> 00:35:15,600
 maybe the Holly and the Ivy equate

885
00:35:15,600 --> 00:35:17,600
 with male and female genitals.

886
00:35:17,600 --> 00:35:20,600
 And if you read the lyrics with that in mind,

887
00:35:20,600 --> 00:35:21,600
 things like the big thorn

888
00:35:21,600 --> 00:35:23,600
 that's mentioned in about verse three,

889
00:35:23,600 --> 00:35:26,600
 do suddenly sound quite raunchy.

890
00:35:26,600 --> 00:35:28,600
 And you can imagine the congregation dancing

891
00:35:28,600 --> 00:35:30,600
 in a bit of a sort of Beyonce way,

892
00:35:30,600 --> 00:35:33,600
 that maybe a 10th century priest might object to.

893
00:35:33,600 --> 00:35:34,600
 Yeah.

894
00:35:34,600 --> 00:35:35,600
 Wow.

895
00:35:35,600 --> 00:35:37,600
 I think that's why they do carols singing round to houses, right,

896
00:35:37,600 --> 00:35:39,600
 because it was banned from churches,

897
00:35:39,600 --> 00:35:40,600
 and they can kind of see

898
00:35:40,600 --> 00:35:42,600
 if they're all doing sexy dances.

899
00:35:42,600 --> 00:35:46,600
 There was a great one in Sri Lanka in 2016.

900
00:35:46,600 --> 00:35:49,600
 The church accidentally printed the wrong lyrics for Hail Mary.

901
00:35:49,600 --> 00:35:53,600
 They accidentally printed Tupac's version of Hail Mary,

902
00:35:53,600 --> 00:35:54,600
 and so they all had the lyrics.

903
00:35:54,600 --> 00:35:56,600
 And it is one of those things where,

904
00:35:56,600 --> 00:35:58,600
 when you read the lyrics, I've got them here,

905
00:35:58,600 --> 00:35:59,600
 there's a few bits where it says,

906
00:35:59,600 --> 00:36:01,600
 "This blows like a 12-gauge shorty,"

907
00:36:01,600 --> 00:36:03,600
 or shorty rather, so a gun,

908
00:36:03,600 --> 00:36:05,600
 but 12 days kind of immediately you're thinking,

909
00:36:05,600 --> 00:36:06,600
 "Okay, is this Christmassy?"

910
00:36:06,600 --> 00:36:07,600
 "This sounds Christmassy."

911
00:36:07,600 --> 00:36:08,600
 Okay.

912
00:36:08,600 --> 00:36:09,600
 "Feel me."

913
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:12,600
 And God said he should send his one begotten son.

914
00:36:12,600 --> 00:36:13,600
 I mean, he's...

915
00:36:13,600 --> 00:36:14,600
 Yeah, "Feel me like you feel Jesus."

916
00:36:14,600 --> 00:36:15,600
 Yeah, exactly.

917
00:36:15,600 --> 00:36:16,600
 And the Holy Spirit in you.

918
00:36:16,600 --> 00:36:17,600
 It's legit.

919
00:36:17,600 --> 00:36:19,600
 So I imagine they got in quite a few verses into this

920
00:36:19,600 --> 00:36:21,600
 before realizing Tupac was behind the lyrics,

921
00:36:21,600 --> 00:36:23,600
 as opposed to, yeah.

922
00:36:23,600 --> 00:36:25,600
 You know the song Silent Night?

923
00:36:25,600 --> 00:36:26,600
 Yeah.

924
00:36:26,600 --> 00:36:27,600
 I'm sure you do.

925
00:36:27,600 --> 00:36:28,600
 It's written by two people.

926
00:36:28,600 --> 00:36:31,600
 The lyrics written by a guy called Joseph Moore,

927
00:36:31,600 --> 00:36:33,600
 who was a priest in Salzburg,

928
00:36:33,600 --> 00:36:37,600
 and the music was written by an organist called Franz Gruber,

929
00:36:37,600 --> 00:36:39,600
 who is from a village called Arndorf,

930
00:36:39,600 --> 00:36:41,600
 and became very popular, of course.

931
00:36:41,600 --> 00:36:44,600
 They both died, as people do.

932
00:36:44,600 --> 00:36:46,600
 And in 1912...

933
00:36:46,600 --> 00:36:47,600
 Oh, there.

934
00:36:47,600 --> 00:36:48,600
 Spoiler alert.

935
00:36:48,600 --> 00:36:49,600
 Too soon.

936
00:36:49,600 --> 00:36:50,600
 I'm talking about it.

937
00:36:50,600 --> 00:36:53,600
 That was just another one for the funeral directors.

938
00:36:53,600 --> 00:36:56,600
 In 1912, the Austrian Taurus Office decided

939
00:36:56,600 --> 00:36:59,600
 that they wanted a memorial for these two writers.

940
00:36:59,600 --> 00:37:02,600
 And there were loads of paintings of this guy called Gruber,

941
00:37:02,600 --> 00:37:04,600
 but there were no paintings of Moore,

942
00:37:04,600 --> 00:37:06,600
 because he hated having his painting done.

943
00:37:06,600 --> 00:37:09,600
 And so to get this sculpture,

944
00:37:09,600 --> 00:37:13,600
 they dig up his grave and take out his skull,

945
00:37:13,600 --> 00:37:15,600
 so that they can make a sculpture of him.

946
00:37:15,600 --> 00:37:17,600
 And the sculpture is still there,

947
00:37:17,600 --> 00:37:21,600
 and they reinterred the skull in the chapel where the sculpture is.

948
00:37:21,600 --> 00:37:23,600
 But that's going a long way, isn't it?

949
00:37:23,600 --> 00:37:25,600
 That's misinterpreting the word "sculpture."

950
00:37:25,600 --> 00:37:28,600
 That's insane.

951
00:37:28,600 --> 00:37:30,600
 Did they do a sculpture of then the skull,

952
00:37:30,600 --> 00:37:32,600
 or did they put flesh over it?

953
00:37:32,600 --> 00:37:34,600
 I think they must have got the skull and gone,

954
00:37:34,600 --> 00:37:37,600
 while he's got, you know, he's got big cheekbones.

955
00:37:37,600 --> 00:37:40,600
 Imagine not liking having your portrait done in life,

956
00:37:40,600 --> 00:37:42,600
 and then imagine if he could have known that after his death,

957
00:37:42,600 --> 00:37:45,600
 people would dig up his body to do the thing he didn't want done

958
00:37:45,600 --> 00:37:47,600
 even when he was alive.

959
00:37:47,600 --> 00:37:49,600
 He probably would have acquiesced to one in his lifetime

960
00:37:49,600 --> 00:37:51,600
 if he knew that was going to happen.

961
00:37:51,600 --> 00:37:53,600
 Franz Gruber is such a good name,

962
00:37:53,600 --> 00:37:55,600
 because it's almost exactly the villain of Die Hard.

963
00:37:55,600 --> 00:37:57,600
 I know, that's like Hans Gruber.

964
00:37:57,600 --> 00:38:00,600
 Because I've never seen Die Hard, but I do know about that.

965
00:38:00,600 --> 00:38:02,600
 And when I saw this guy who was called Franz Gruber,

966
00:38:02,600 --> 00:38:04,600
 I genuinely thought it was him,

967
00:38:04,600 --> 00:38:06,600
 and I was like, "This is the best fact I've ever heard."

968
00:38:06,600 --> 00:38:08,600
 Silent Night was written by Hans Gruber?

969
00:38:08,600 --> 00:38:12,600
 Yeah, he wrote it at the Nakatomi Plaza building.

970
00:38:12,600 --> 00:38:15,600
 The guy who wrote Silent Night apparently did it,

971
00:38:15,600 --> 00:38:17,600
 because the organ was broken,

972
00:38:17,600 --> 00:38:21,600
 and he needed an emergency to come up with the tune in time for Christmas.

973
00:38:21,600 --> 00:38:23,600
 And I think he was near Salzburg,

974
00:38:23,600 --> 00:38:26,600
 and so he was a vicar, wasn't he, or a priest,

975
00:38:26,600 --> 00:38:28,600
 and he went to this church, he was working in this church,

976
00:38:28,600 --> 00:38:31,600
 and the organ was quite crap, didn't work,

977
00:38:31,600 --> 00:38:33,600
 and so he was very good at the guitar,

978
00:38:33,600 --> 00:38:35,600
 and so instead it was supposed to be a company by the guitar

979
00:38:35,600 --> 00:38:38,600
 in its early days, and then it became more acapella.

980
00:38:38,600 --> 00:38:41,600
 But it was so popular, within 30 years,

981
00:38:41,600 --> 00:38:43,600
 there was a version along the Labrador Coast

982
00:38:43,600 --> 00:38:45,600
 where it was translated into Inuktitut,

983
00:38:45,600 --> 00:38:48,600
 as in like the Inuit language, in 30 years.

984
00:38:48,600 --> 00:38:51,600
 Oh my God, and you know why they went to the organ?

985
00:38:51,600 --> 00:38:53,600
 So they were playing it on the guitar,

986
00:38:53,600 --> 00:38:55,600
 but the guitar was banned from churches.

987
00:38:55,600 --> 00:38:57,600
 It wasn't seen as a church instrument,

988
00:38:57,600 --> 00:39:00,600
 so you could only allow it to play certain instruments in church.

989
00:39:00,600 --> 00:39:02,600
 He wrote it on the guitar, they wouldn't let him play it,

990
00:39:02,600 --> 00:39:04,600
 so he played it outside,

991
00:39:04,600 --> 00:39:06,600
 and then that's why he had to get the organist in.

992
00:39:06,600 --> 00:39:09,600
 I didn't know that carols used to be for all occasions,

993
00:39:09,600 --> 00:39:11,600
 much like crackers, they were just themed differently,

994
00:39:11,600 --> 00:39:14,600
 so there were Easter carols, there were New Year carols.

995
00:39:14,600 --> 00:39:17,600
 Was the one for the Anglo-Egyptian War of 18, whatever it was?

996
00:39:17,600 --> 00:39:20,600
 Okay, there wasn't, but there was a Battle of Agincourt carol.

997
00:39:20,600 --> 00:39:21,600
 No way.

998
00:39:21,600 --> 00:39:23,600
 Yes, there was a carol that was written

999
00:39:23,600 --> 00:39:25,600
 after the Battle of Agincourt in 1415.

1000
00:39:25,600 --> 00:39:26,600
 Oh, so not for it.

1001
00:39:26,600 --> 00:39:29,600
 No one was running out of the front with their guitar.

1002
00:39:29,600 --> 00:39:31,600
 No, sadly, I think they waited until the result was in

1003
00:39:31,600 --> 00:39:33,600
 before they commemorated it in song,

1004
00:39:33,600 --> 00:39:35,600
 because otherwise that's cocky.

1005
00:39:35,600 --> 00:39:38,600
 In the Second World War, carol singers kept going,

1006
00:39:38,600 --> 00:39:40,600
 but they were a bit restricted,

1007
00:39:40,600 --> 00:39:43,600
 and so to be safe during the blackout in Britain,

1008
00:39:43,600 --> 00:39:45,600
 in World War II, in London specifically,

1009
00:39:45,600 --> 00:39:47,600
 they weren't allowed to carry lanterns around with them

1010
00:39:47,600 --> 00:39:48,600
 when it kind of lights,

1011
00:39:48,600 --> 00:39:50,600
 so they couldn't actually read their hym sheets at all,

1012
00:39:50,600 --> 00:39:54,600
 and you couldn't see them, obviously, when you open the door.

1013
00:39:54,600 --> 00:39:57,600
 And they also issued with a government warning

1014
00:39:57,600 --> 00:40:01,600
 that they mustn't warble like air raid sirens.

1015
00:40:01,600 --> 00:40:04,600
 That's a bad singing, if you can't tell the difference

1016
00:40:04,600 --> 00:40:06,600
 between a carol singing and an air raid siren.

1017
00:40:06,600 --> 00:40:08,600
 People flocking to the underground

1018
00:40:08,600 --> 00:40:10,600
 every time they're all dancing.

1019
00:40:10,600 --> 00:40:12,600
 No, no, no. It's okay.

1020
00:40:12,600 --> 00:40:15,600
 I suppose that bit that goes, blah, blah, blah.

1021
00:40:15,600 --> 00:40:17,600
 That does sound a bit like it.

1022
00:40:17,600 --> 00:40:19,600
 It does sound like it, yeah.

1023
00:40:19,600 --> 00:40:22,600
 We've got to move on in the set, guys, for our final fact.

1024
00:40:22,600 --> 00:40:23,600
 I'll tell you what.

1025
00:40:23,600 --> 00:40:26,600
 While I was searching for carol singer shot

1026
00:40:26,600 --> 00:40:28,600
 on the newspaper archives,

1027
00:40:28,600 --> 00:40:30,600
 I came across an article in The Sun

1028
00:40:30,600 --> 00:40:33,600
 from Thursday the 5th of January, 1871,

1029
00:40:33,600 --> 00:40:35,600
 and they had a Christmas cracker joke.

1030
00:40:35,600 --> 00:40:36,600
 Do you want to hear it?

1031
00:40:36,600 --> 00:40:37,600
 Yeah.

1032
00:40:37,600 --> 00:40:38,600
 Because we did that before.

1033
00:40:38,600 --> 00:40:41,600
 What ancient author is supposed to have written

1034
00:40:41,600 --> 00:40:43,600
 a treatise on plum pudding?

1035
00:40:43,600 --> 00:40:45,600
 I think I've got it.

1036
00:40:45,600 --> 00:40:46,600
 Have you?

1037
00:40:46,600 --> 00:40:47,600
 Is it Suetonius?

1038
00:40:47,600 --> 00:40:49,600
 It's Suetonius.

1039
00:40:49,600 --> 00:40:51,600
 Isn't that amazing?

1040
00:40:51,600 --> 00:40:54,600
 That is in The Sun in 1871.

1041
00:40:54,600 --> 00:40:55,600
 The Sun's changed, hasn't it?

1042
00:40:55,600 --> 00:40:56,600
 It's amazing.

1043
00:40:56,600 --> 00:40:59,600
 And just for anyone watching who doesn't get that,

1044
00:40:59,600 --> 00:41:02,600
 can we explain what that means?

1045
00:41:02,600 --> 00:41:03,600
 I don't think so.

1046
00:41:03,600 --> 00:41:05,600
 Suetonius is a type of pastry

1047
00:41:05,600 --> 00:41:07,600
 that's made out of animal innards.

1048
00:41:07,600 --> 00:41:09,600
 And Suetonius was an orator.

1049
00:41:09,600 --> 00:41:11,600
 Classical writer.

1050
00:41:11,600 --> 00:41:13,600
 You're welcome.

1051
00:41:13,600 --> 00:41:16,600
 In the same article, by the way,

1052
00:41:16,600 --> 00:41:18,600
 it said the noticeable feature of Liverpool police sheets

1053
00:41:18,600 --> 00:41:21,600
 on Monday was the fact that only 66 persons

1054
00:41:21,600 --> 00:41:25,600
 had been booked for being drunk and disorderly.

1055
00:41:25,600 --> 00:41:26,600
 Good numbers.

1056
00:41:26,600 --> 00:41:28,600
 Small victories.

1057
00:41:28,600 --> 00:41:30,600
 OK, should we move on to our final fact?

1058
00:41:30,600 --> 00:41:31,600
 Yes.

1059
00:41:31,600 --> 00:41:33,600
 All right, it is time for our final fact of the show,

1060
00:41:33,600 --> 00:41:35,600
 and that is James.

1061
00:41:35,600 --> 00:41:38,600
 OK, my fact this week is that Jim carries makeup

1062
00:41:38,600 --> 00:41:41,600
 for the Grinch was so onerous to apply,

1063
00:41:41,600 --> 00:41:44,600
 the studio brought in one of the CIA's experts

1064
00:41:44,600 --> 00:41:47,600
 at Enduring Torture to help him get through it.

1065
00:41:47,600 --> 00:41:51,600
 So yeah, this is about Jim Carrey and the making of the Grinch.

1066
00:41:51,600 --> 00:41:54,600
 And he had so much makeup on.

1067
00:41:54,600 --> 00:41:57,600
 He said it was like being buried alive.

1068
00:41:57,600 --> 00:42:00,600
 The main guy who was in charge of it was Ron Howard, the director.

1069
00:42:00,600 --> 00:42:03,600
 And he had a partner who was a producer called Brian Grazer.

1070
00:42:03,600 --> 00:42:06,600
 And Brian Grazer had a friend who was from the CIA,

1071
00:42:06,600 --> 00:42:10,600
 and he was a specialised in kind of helping people get through torture.

1072
00:42:10,600 --> 00:42:13,600
 And he spent the weekend with Jim Carrey saying,

1073
00:42:13,600 --> 00:42:16,600
 this is the way that you have to sit through hours and hours and hours.

1074
00:42:16,600 --> 00:42:20,600
 It was eight and a half hours that he had to sit there having this makeup on.

1075
00:42:20,600 --> 00:42:21,600
 That's a lot.

1076
00:42:21,600 --> 00:42:22,600
 He got taught how to do it.

1077
00:42:22,600 --> 00:42:25,600
 And Carrey said at first that he thought it was quite hilarious,

1078
00:42:25,600 --> 00:42:28,600
 but in the end, you know, it did the job and they made the film.

1079
00:42:28,600 --> 00:42:30,600
 Because he said that he wasn't going to do the film.

1080
00:42:30,600 --> 00:42:31,600
 You know, he said this is too much.

1081
00:42:31,600 --> 00:42:34,600
 Yeah, he said he had to sort of become a Zen master.

1082
00:42:34,600 --> 00:42:38,600
 He had to train himself to just be at peace.

1083
00:42:38,600 --> 00:42:40,600
 The guy, the CIA guy had to teach him a lot of things.

1084
00:42:40,600 --> 00:42:42,600
 One of the main things was distraction.

1085
00:42:42,600 --> 00:42:45,600
 He was saying, and there's a clip of Jim Carrey talking about this

1086
00:42:45,600 --> 00:42:47,600
 on The Graham Norton Show where he really goes into it,

1087
00:42:47,600 --> 00:42:50,600
 where he says, you just have to punch yourself at times, just at random.

1088
00:42:50,600 --> 00:42:52,600
 Just go, it hit yourself in the leg.

1089
00:42:52,600 --> 00:42:56,600
 Suddenly just get up to check something, do something very different.

1090
00:42:56,600 --> 00:42:58,600
 He did a lot of smoking while he was doing it.

1091
00:42:58,600 --> 00:43:03,600
 This is not describing the Zen monk that I have in my mind.

1092
00:43:03,600 --> 00:43:08,600
 But the stress of it with the smoking was just to get through the stress.

1093
00:43:08,600 --> 00:43:11,600
 But the problem was, is that he was wearing this really thick grinch suit,

1094
00:43:11,600 --> 00:43:13,600
 which was made of yak hair.

1095
00:43:13,600 --> 00:43:15,600
 And so he had to have a really long extended pipe.

1096
00:43:15,600 --> 00:43:17,600
 So he was sitting there sort of going on.

1097
00:43:17,600 --> 00:43:20,600
 That's so Dr. Sussian, isn't it?

1098
00:43:20,600 --> 00:43:24,600
 But then of course the movie did go on to win the Oscar for best makeup.

1099
00:43:24,600 --> 00:43:26,600
 So it was all worth it in the end.

1100
00:43:26,600 --> 00:43:27,600
 Is it?

1101
00:43:27,600 --> 00:43:29,600
 Will he have been happy about the best makeup Oscar?

1102
00:43:29,600 --> 00:43:31,600
 Because it feels like it's a bit of a slap in the face.

1103
00:43:31,600 --> 00:43:35,600
 And apparently they're saying all the stuff around your body is getting an award.

1104
00:43:35,600 --> 00:43:36,600
 And you are not.

1105
00:43:36,600 --> 00:43:38,600
 Yeah, but I'll be honest.

1106
00:43:38,600 --> 00:43:43,600
 I don't think that his performance in the Grinch probably was going to win best actor in the Oscars.

1107
00:43:43,600 --> 00:43:46,600
 Yeah, I started watching it as research for this fact.

1108
00:43:46,600 --> 00:43:50,600
 And I can say that I've seen the first six minutes of the film.

1109
00:43:50,600 --> 00:43:53,600
 Would you describe the makeup as deserving of a best actor role?

1110
00:43:53,600 --> 00:43:55,600
 Makeup is incredible, yeah.

1111
00:43:55,600 --> 00:43:56,600
 Yeah, regardless of the movie.

1112
00:43:56,600 --> 00:44:02,600
 So the guy who did it is called Kazuhiro Tsuji, and he's an amazing sort of legend of the makeup world.

1113
00:44:02,600 --> 00:44:05,600
 And he said that, yeah, Kerry was a bit of a nightmare to work with.

1114
00:44:05,600 --> 00:44:08,600
 And that, I mean, it sounds horrible being under all this makeup.

1115
00:44:08,600 --> 00:44:10,600
 It sounds really, really restrictive.

1116
00:44:10,600 --> 00:44:16,600
 But Kerry apparently sometimes said, you're painting me a different color to the color you painted me yesterday.

1117
00:44:16,600 --> 00:44:20,600
 And Tsuji obviously wanted to say, why would I do that?

1118
00:44:20,600 --> 00:44:24,600
 Why on this big budget Hollywood film would I paint you a different color?

1119
00:44:24,600 --> 00:44:29,600
 Imagine if you started watching it, and you're just like, wait a minute, I just went from green to red.

1120
00:44:29,600 --> 00:44:30,600
 It used to be green.

1121
00:44:30,600 --> 00:44:33,600
 And Kerry kept saying, you've got to fix it.

1122
00:44:33,600 --> 00:44:34,600
 You've got to fix this.

1123
00:44:34,600 --> 00:44:37,600
 And he said in an interview, so I fixed it.

1124
00:44:37,600 --> 00:44:40,600
 I kept painting it the same color, you know, claimed it was different.

1125
00:44:40,600 --> 00:44:41,600
 Yeah.

1126
00:44:41,600 --> 00:44:47,600
 Fittingly, actually, I think he only took that job in exchange for a green card.

1127
00:44:47,600 --> 00:44:50,600
 So if anyone knew about the color green, it was this guy.

1128
00:44:50,600 --> 00:44:51,600
 Brilliant, brilliant.

1129
00:44:51,600 --> 00:44:53,600
 It's not quite that, actually.

1130
00:44:53,600 --> 00:44:56,600
 No, no, no, that's absolutely true.

1131
00:44:56,600 --> 00:44:57,600
 It's not why he took the job.

1132
00:44:57,600 --> 00:45:01,600
 He took the job because he was offered it and he thought this would be great.

1133
00:45:01,600 --> 00:45:08,600
 He was doing the job, but the stress that Jim Kerry put him under during this job was so intense that he had to quit.

1134
00:45:08,600 --> 00:45:12,600
 And he actually had to get a bit of therapy because Jim Kerry was kicking his foot through.

1135
00:45:12,600 --> 00:45:16,600
 This is before he was then monk-like and had a CIA guy come in, I think.

1136
00:45:16,600 --> 00:45:20,600
 The guy, this makeup artist says he was a real dick on the set.

1137
00:45:20,600 --> 00:45:22,600
 He was rude to everyone.

1138
00:45:22,600 --> 00:45:24,600
 And Jim Kerry goes very method.

1139
00:45:24,600 --> 00:45:28,600
 It's hard to know if he thought he was the Grinch and he was embodying that character.

1140
00:45:28,600 --> 00:45:29,600
 What an excuse.

1141
00:45:29,600 --> 00:45:30,600
 Come on.

1142
00:45:30,600 --> 00:45:35,600
 Well, there's a very famous documentary, which I'll mention in a second, but just to finish that,

1143
00:45:35,600 --> 00:45:42,600
 he basically sent this guy off the movie because he was so traumatized by Jim Kerry, how he spoke to him and everyone else.

1144
00:45:42,600 --> 00:45:48,600
 So he was off for a couple of weeks and Jim Kerry called him up himself and so did Ron Howard and said,

1145
00:45:48,600 --> 00:45:53,600
 "Please come back. I've worked on my temper. I'm zen-like now. Please come back and do it."

1146
00:45:53,600 --> 00:45:54,600
 And he said, "Okay, I will."

1147
00:45:54,600 --> 00:45:56,600
 And his friends said to him, "Why don't you do it for more money?"

1148
00:45:56,600 --> 00:45:58,600
 He said, "I don't want to ask for more money."

1149
00:45:58,600 --> 00:46:01,600
 But then he went, "Okay, I'll tell you what though. I'll do it for a green card."

1150
00:46:01,600 --> 00:46:03,600
 And that's how...

1151
00:46:03,600 --> 00:46:05,600
 So you can work in America?

1152
00:46:05,600 --> 00:46:06,600
 Yes.

1153
00:46:06,600 --> 00:46:09,600
 Well, then I think they didn't even give him the green card until he got the BAFTA.

1154
00:46:09,600 --> 00:46:10,600
 It was a hard one thing.

1155
00:46:10,600 --> 00:46:11,600
 The BAFTA or the Oscar?

1156
00:46:11,600 --> 00:46:17,600
 No, it was BAFTA, weirdly, but it was quite a big deal for once the BAFTA was in America then in that one year.

1157
00:46:17,600 --> 00:46:20,600
 So he got a BAFTA for the makeup and then they gave him a green card.

1158
00:46:20,600 --> 00:46:23,600
 But that was a high bar to have to pass.

1159
00:46:23,600 --> 00:46:28,600
 So the movie you're talking about where he goes method is called Jim and Andy, isn't it?

1160
00:46:28,600 --> 00:46:31,600
 Well, the movie was Man on the Moon where he plays Andy Kaufman.

1161
00:46:31,600 --> 00:46:32,600
 But yeah, there was a documentary.

1162
00:46:32,600 --> 00:46:38,600
 They did a documentary where it was like that, but he got the job while he was working on Man on the Moon, didn't he?

1163
00:46:38,600 --> 00:46:48,600
 And Audrey Geisel, who was Dr. Seuss's wife, went to visit him while he was doing that movie and tried to decide if he was going to get the job.

1164
00:46:48,600 --> 00:46:56,600
 Now, he was doing this movie pretending to be Andy Kaufman and was so method that he wouldn't respond to Jim Carrey.

1165
00:46:56,600 --> 00:47:01,600
 He would only respond to Andy Kaufman and he would just pretend to be him completely.

1166
00:47:01,600 --> 00:47:04,600
 Basically, for the whole making this movie, he was Andy Kaufman.

1167
00:47:04,600 --> 00:47:09,600
 And so when Audrey Geisel came to interview him and said, "Do you want to do the Grinch?"

1168
00:47:09,600 --> 00:47:18,600
 The only way she could find out what he would be like was if Andy Kaufman did an impression of Jim Carrey who was doing an impression of being the Grinch.

1169
00:47:18,600 --> 00:47:19,600
 Yes.

1170
00:47:19,600 --> 00:47:20,600
 Wow.

1171
00:47:20,600 --> 00:47:21,600
 Yeah.

1172
00:47:21,600 --> 00:47:23,600
 There's a dog in the Grinch.

1173
00:47:23,600 --> 00:47:25,600
 The Grinch has a dog.

1174
00:47:25,600 --> 00:47:27,600
 But it looks pretty normal.

1175
00:47:27,600 --> 00:47:30,600
 Certainly in the first six minutes, there are some interactions between the Grinch and his dog.

1176
00:47:30,600 --> 00:47:33,600
 And I found out later the dog is voiced by a human.

1177
00:47:33,600 --> 00:47:35,600
 And you can use the dog's box.

1178
00:47:35,600 --> 00:47:36,600
 That's disgusting.

1179
00:47:36,600 --> 00:47:38,600
 It's putting dogs out of business as humans.

1180
00:47:38,600 --> 00:47:39,600
 Yeah.

1181
00:47:39,600 --> 00:47:41,600
 It's a guy called Frank Welker.

1182
00:47:41,600 --> 00:47:42,600
 Oh.

1183
00:47:42,600 --> 00:47:43,600
 Frank Welker, yeah.

1184
00:47:43,600 --> 00:47:44,600
 Oh, okay.

1185
00:47:44,600 --> 00:47:45,600
 Does he do a lot of dogs?

1186
00:47:45,600 --> 00:47:49,600
 Frank Welker's probably got more Hollywood box office hits behind him than any actor alive.

1187
00:47:49,600 --> 00:47:50,600
 Huge claim.

1188
00:47:50,600 --> 00:47:51,600
 Huge.

1189
00:47:51,600 --> 00:47:53,600
 Well, I mean, so this is the thing.

1190
00:47:53,600 --> 00:47:56,600
 He does have form in playing dogs because he also played Scooby-Doo.

1191
00:47:56,600 --> 00:47:57,600
 Oh, there you go.

1192
00:47:57,600 --> 00:47:58,600
 Yeah.

1193
00:47:58,600 --> 00:47:59,600
 So maybe it's his thing.

1194
00:47:59,600 --> 00:48:00,600
 Can I go to Frank Welker's IMDB?

1195
00:48:00,600 --> 00:48:02,600
 He is the most successful actor on earth.

1196
00:48:02,600 --> 00:48:05,600
 I can't believe this because surely we would have heard of him more.

1197
00:48:05,600 --> 00:48:07,600
 No, because he does voices.

1198
00:48:07,600 --> 00:48:11,600
 It's like Andy Serkis before we found out his name and he was Gollum and King Kong.

1199
00:48:11,600 --> 00:48:12,600
 Yeah, yeah.

1200
00:48:12,600 --> 00:48:14,600
 Well, this is a bit like the original Grinch, right?

1201
00:48:14,600 --> 00:48:20,600
 Thel Ravenscroft was the voice of the Grinch and he was Tony the Tiger and lots of other people.

1202
00:48:20,600 --> 00:48:24,600
 But people didn't know that because, sorry, he sung the Grinch's songs.

1203
00:48:24,600 --> 00:48:27,600
 But Boris Karloff was the Grinch's normal voice.

1204
00:48:27,600 --> 00:48:28,600
 So cool.

1205
00:48:28,600 --> 00:48:30,600
 Which, well, that's what cool that he was.

1206
00:48:30,600 --> 00:48:31,600
 Frankenstein.

1207
00:48:31,600 --> 00:48:32,600
 Yeah.

1208
00:48:32,600 --> 00:48:33,600
 The Mummy.

1209
00:48:33,600 --> 00:48:35,600
 It is very cool, but then he got all the credit.

1210
00:48:35,600 --> 00:48:37,600
 So it was reported as him being the Grinch.

1211
00:48:37,600 --> 00:48:40,600
 Whereas actually the main song was sung by Tony the Tiger.

1212
00:48:40,600 --> 00:48:44,600
 And it was great.

1213
00:48:44,600 --> 00:48:47,600
 Can I give you another joke from our crackers earlier on?

1214
00:48:47,600 --> 00:48:48,600
 Yeah, you were saving one.

1215
00:48:48,600 --> 00:48:49,600
 Yeah, it's this one.

1216
00:48:49,600 --> 00:48:52,600
 What is the name of the Grinch's dog?

1217
00:48:52,600 --> 00:48:53,600
 It's A. Ben.

1218
00:48:53,600 --> 00:48:54,600
 B. Max.

1219
00:48:54,600 --> 00:48:55,600
 C. Sam.

1220
00:48:55,600 --> 00:48:57,600
 Or D. Buddy.

1221
00:48:57,600 --> 00:49:02,600
 I literally watched the film and I have a note about the dog and Dan is the one who knows.

1222
00:49:02,600 --> 00:49:03,600
 I'm so upset.

1223
00:49:03,600 --> 00:49:04,600
 What is it?

1224
00:49:04,600 --> 00:49:05,600
 I'm going for Max.

1225
00:49:05,600 --> 00:49:08,600
 Oh, I'll say Dan knows the answer.

1226
00:49:08,600 --> 00:49:10,600
 I mean, go for something else if you want.

1227
00:49:10,600 --> 00:49:11,600
 I'll say Buddy.

1228
00:49:11,600 --> 00:49:12,600
 I'll spin it all.

1229
00:49:12,600 --> 00:49:13,600
 Put everything on Buddy.

1230
00:49:13,600 --> 00:49:15,600
 It's Max.

1231
00:49:15,600 --> 00:49:17,600
 The Grinch wasn't green originally.

1232
00:49:17,600 --> 00:49:19,600
 He was black and white with pink eyes.

1233
00:49:19,600 --> 00:49:20,600
 Yeah.

1234
00:49:20,600 --> 00:49:23,600
 I'm not sure if that's with pink eyes or with pink eye, the medical condition.

1235
00:49:23,600 --> 00:49:24,600
 I doubt it.

1236
00:49:24,600 --> 00:49:26,600
 That wasn't what it was about, certainly.

1237
00:49:26,600 --> 00:49:27,600
 That was a theme.

1238
00:49:27,600 --> 00:49:29,600
 Do you know what color green he is?

1239
00:49:29,600 --> 00:49:30,600
 What shade of green?

1240
00:49:30,600 --> 00:49:34,600
 Is there a particular Grinch green that Dr. Seuss demanded?

1241
00:49:34,600 --> 00:49:35,600
 Kind of.

1242
00:49:35,600 --> 00:49:36,600
 It's ugly car.

1243
00:49:36,600 --> 00:49:42,600
 And that's not a specific green, obviously, but the director of that film, Chuck Jones,

1244
00:49:42,600 --> 00:49:47,600
 was inspired to use that color green because he had this ugly car that he rented that was

1245
00:49:47,600 --> 00:49:49,600
 this horrible shade of green.

1246
00:49:49,600 --> 00:49:52,600
 And he went, actually, that would look amazing on my Grinch.

1247
00:49:52,600 --> 00:49:53,600
 Wow.

1248
00:49:53,600 --> 00:49:55,600
 And he picked that exact color and put it on the Grinch.

1249
00:49:55,600 --> 00:49:59,600
 Actually, speaking of Grinch-related cars, Audrey Geisel, who we're talking about, who,

1250
00:49:59,600 --> 00:50:05,600
 sadly, she died a couple of years ago, but at the age of 97, and she ran all of the Dr.

1251
00:50:05,600 --> 00:50:09,600
 Seuss estate for quite a long time, she had a Cadillac that she would drive around with

1252
00:50:09,600 --> 00:50:11,600
 with the number plate that read Grinch.

1253
00:50:11,600 --> 00:50:12,600
 Wow.

1254
00:50:12,600 --> 00:50:13,600
 Psycho.

1255
00:50:13,600 --> 00:50:19,600
 It's not Grinch posters, sort of, Reformation of Character or Pre is what I'd want to know.

1256
00:50:19,600 --> 00:50:26,600
 I think deep down, the Grinch is a good guy who is misunderstood at the start, right?

1257
00:50:26,600 --> 00:50:30,600
 Because there were two kids, two little boys called Bob and David Grinch from New Jersey.

1258
00:50:30,600 --> 00:50:35,600
 They wrote a letter to Dr. Seuss saying everyone makes fun of them all the time because they're

1259
00:50:35,600 --> 00:50:36,600
 called the Grinch brothers.

1260
00:50:36,600 --> 00:50:40,600
 And he wrote back to them saying, no, the Grinch is a hero, a changed man.

1261
00:50:40,600 --> 00:50:43,600
 Tell the other kids it's not where you start, it's where you end up.

1262
00:50:43,600 --> 00:50:50,600
 That's a hard message when your head is being flushed down a toilet to articulate.

1263
00:50:50,600 --> 00:50:54,600
 And I looked into some makeup, a little bit of movie makeup stuff.

1264
00:50:54,600 --> 00:50:55,600
 Oh, yeah.

1265
00:50:55,600 --> 00:50:58,600
 And so traumatizing makeup experiences in films.

1266
00:50:58,600 --> 00:51:04,600
 And I think the prize goes to the person who played the Tin Man in Wizard of Oz originally,

1267
00:51:04,600 --> 00:51:05,600
 who was Buddy Ebson.

1268
00:51:05,600 --> 00:51:08,600
 So the Tin Man in the Wizard of Oz was extremely intense.

1269
00:51:08,600 --> 00:51:12,600
 It was one of those, took five hours to put the makeup on every morning, and then five

1270
00:51:12,600 --> 00:51:13,600
 hours to take it off again.

1271
00:51:13,600 --> 00:51:15,600
 And you don't know when they even got the acting in.

1272
00:51:15,600 --> 00:51:19,600
 And eventually he got really ill from all these aluminium powder fumes.

1273
00:51:19,600 --> 00:51:21,600
 He was ingesting and inhaling.

1274
00:51:21,600 --> 00:51:23,600
 And he woke up in the middle of the night screaming.

1275
00:51:23,600 --> 00:51:25,600
 And he had violent cramping all over his body.

1276
00:51:25,600 --> 00:51:26,600
 And he was rushed to hospital.

1277
00:51:26,600 --> 00:51:28,600
 He was in this oxygen tent for weeks.

1278
00:51:28,600 --> 00:51:31,600
 And did they find he didn't have a heart?

1279
00:51:31,600 --> 00:51:33,600
 That was both about the Tin Man.

1280
00:51:33,600 --> 00:51:37,600
 The thing is, Andy, spoiler alert, he did have a heart all along.

1281
00:51:37,600 --> 00:51:38,600
 Did he?

1282
00:51:38,600 --> 00:51:39,600
 I think.

1283
00:51:39,600 --> 00:51:40,600
 Wait, was that it?

1284
00:51:40,600 --> 00:51:41,600
 Oh God, it's been a long time.

1285
00:51:41,600 --> 00:51:42,600
 Does he?

1286
00:51:42,600 --> 00:51:43,600
 I've got Tin.

1287
00:51:43,600 --> 00:51:45,600
 They don't tear out someone's heart, do they, in the film?

1288
00:51:45,600 --> 00:51:46,600
 It's been a while since I've seen it.

1289
00:51:46,600 --> 00:51:48,600
 But I'd be really surprised if it ended with that.

1290
00:51:48,600 --> 00:51:50,600
 I think the lesson is he doesn't need a heart.

1291
00:51:50,600 --> 00:51:52,600
 I think, does he get like a medal of a heart?

1292
00:51:52,600 --> 00:51:53,600
 Or is that the courage for the lion?

1293
00:51:53,600 --> 00:51:55,600
 Thousands of people in the comments are screaming right now.

1294
00:51:55,600 --> 00:51:56,600
 Oh my God.

1295
00:51:56,600 --> 00:51:57,600
 Sorry.

1296
00:51:57,600 --> 00:51:58,600
 Thousands.

1297
00:51:58,600 --> 00:52:01,600
 Well, he, so he didn't need a heart, but he did need the use of his lungs,

1298
00:52:01,600 --> 00:52:02,600
 which he didn't have for a while.

1299
00:52:02,600 --> 00:52:04,600
 And his skin turned blue.

1300
00:52:04,600 --> 00:52:05,600
 And the studio just wouldn't believe it.

1301
00:52:05,600 --> 00:52:07,600
 So the studio were like, no, this is rubbish.

1302
00:52:07,600 --> 00:52:08,600
 You're just malingering.

1303
00:52:08,600 --> 00:52:09,600
 Come back in.

1304
00:52:09,600 --> 00:52:11,600
 You sent someone to the hospital, I think,

1305
00:52:11,600 --> 00:52:14,600
 or to his home when he was just of emerging from this coma to say,

1306
00:52:14,600 --> 00:52:16,600
 you've got to come back and do the acting.

1307
00:52:16,600 --> 00:52:19,600
 And a nurse said, no, no, no, he really is in a bad way.

1308
00:52:19,600 --> 00:52:21,600
 And so they replaced him.

1309
00:52:21,600 --> 00:52:23,600
 And not only did they replace him with this guy, Jack Haley,

1310
00:52:23,600 --> 00:52:24,600
 who played the Tin man,

1311
00:52:24,600 --> 00:52:29,600
 but they never told Jack Haley why the last person had resigned.

1312
00:52:29,600 --> 00:52:31,600
 That's incredible.

1313
00:52:31,600 --> 00:52:35,600
 I've got a makeup fact about the Grinch.

1314
00:52:35,600 --> 00:52:36,600
 Oh, great.

1315
00:52:36,600 --> 00:52:37,600
 Mr. Grinch makeup.

1316
00:52:37,600 --> 00:52:38,600
 Kazuhiro Tsuji.

1317
00:52:38,600 --> 00:52:39,600
 So he's done a few things.

1318
00:52:39,600 --> 00:52:40,600
 He did Men in Black.

1319
00:52:40,600 --> 00:52:42,600
 You know when the guy is sort of a cockroach turned human

1320
00:52:42,600 --> 00:52:44,600
 and he's kind of twitchy under the skin.

1321
00:52:44,600 --> 00:52:45,600
 Terrifying.

1322
00:52:45,600 --> 00:52:48,600
 He designed the silicon, the live twitching silicon.

1323
00:52:48,600 --> 00:52:50,600
 And it was, I think, silicon gel.

1324
00:52:50,600 --> 00:52:52,600
 So it's kind of implant gel on people's faces.

1325
00:52:52,600 --> 00:52:53,600
 So he did that.

1326
00:52:53,600 --> 00:52:54,600
 He did Benjamin Button.

1327
00:52:54,600 --> 00:52:55,600
 He's done all sorts of stuff.

1328
00:52:55,600 --> 00:52:58,600
 But he also, he came out of retirement to do Churchill,

1329
00:52:58,600 --> 00:53:02,600
 because Gary Oldman was playing Churchill a few years ago

1330
00:53:02,600 --> 00:53:04,600
 in a film called Darkest Hour.

1331
00:53:04,600 --> 00:53:07,600
 So he did a wig for Gary Oldman,

1332
00:53:07,600 --> 00:53:09,600
 which has a very specific thing,

1333
00:53:09,600 --> 00:53:13,600
 because Churchill was about mid-60s in the war, I think.

1334
00:53:13,600 --> 00:53:16,600
 And can you guess what he used for Churchill's very fine hair

1335
00:53:16,600 --> 00:53:18,600
 for that face of his life?

1336
00:53:18,600 --> 00:53:21,600
 Well, it wasn't his own pubes or anything, was it?

1337
00:53:21,600 --> 00:53:22,600
 Oh, come on.

1338
00:53:22,600 --> 00:53:24,600
 His own pubes?

1339
00:53:24,600 --> 00:53:28,600
 No, of course it wasn't his own pubes.

1340
00:53:28,600 --> 00:53:30,600
 Picture Churchill in your mind's eye.

1341
00:53:30,600 --> 00:53:31,600
 What is his hairline?

1342
00:53:31,600 --> 00:53:33,600
 Oh, my gosh.

1343
00:53:33,600 --> 00:53:35,600
 It's so much less good than that answer.

1344
00:53:35,600 --> 00:53:39,600
 But it was, it was baby's hair, right, to mimic elderly hair.

1345
00:53:39,600 --> 00:53:40,600
 So he was asked about it.

1346
00:53:40,600 --> 00:53:42,600
 He said baby's hair is the most expensive you can buy in the world,

1347
00:53:42,600 --> 00:53:44,600
 because it's very fine and very thin.

1348
00:53:44,600 --> 00:53:47,600
 And he was quoted, "No one is killed,"

1349
00:53:47,600 --> 00:53:49,600
 alarming way to start talking about this.

1350
00:53:49,600 --> 00:53:52,600
 That just feels like he's protesting way too much.

1351
00:53:52,600 --> 00:53:53,600
 Way too much.

1352
00:53:53,600 --> 00:53:55,600
 No one is killed.

1353
00:53:55,600 --> 00:53:58,600
 No one over the age of two is killed.

1354
00:53:58,600 --> 00:54:01,600
 A baby grows hair, and sometimes they decide to cut it.

1355
00:54:01,600 --> 00:54:04,600
 But it's so far, and it's for the hairline,

1356
00:54:04,600 --> 00:54:06,600
 because often your hair at your hairline is finer.

1357
00:54:06,600 --> 00:54:07,600
 Wow.

1358
00:54:07,600 --> 00:54:08,600
 But it was so fragile.

1359
00:54:08,600 --> 00:54:10,600
 He had to make a new wig every 10 days.

1360
00:54:10,600 --> 00:54:14,600
 How many children did he have to shave?

1361
00:54:14,600 --> 00:54:16,600
 We've got to wrap up soon.

1362
00:54:16,600 --> 00:54:19,600
 Guys, we've actually gone way further than we ever should have

1363
00:54:19,600 --> 00:54:20,600
 in a live stream.

1364
00:54:20,600 --> 00:54:24,600
 So just more Christmas movie stuff really quickly.

1365
00:54:24,600 --> 00:54:28,600
 The IMDB Top 100 Christmas Movies by rating.

1366
00:54:28,600 --> 00:54:30,600
 It's a wonderful life.

1367
00:54:30,600 --> 00:54:32,600
 How the Grinch Stole Christmas, which I thought was going to be

1368
00:54:32,600 --> 00:54:33,600
 the one that we were talking about,

1369
00:54:33,600 --> 00:54:36,600
 was actually the 1966 one that Anna was talking about.

1370
00:54:36,600 --> 00:54:38,600
 Charlie Brown's Christmas, and then Die Hard,

1371
00:54:38,600 --> 00:54:40,600
 which is the controversial one, right?

1372
00:54:40,600 --> 00:54:41,600
 Because some people think it's Christmas.

1373
00:54:41,600 --> 00:54:42,600
 Some people think it isn't.

1374
00:54:42,600 --> 00:54:43,600
 Yeah.

1375
00:54:43,600 --> 00:54:46,600
 But the villain did write Silent Night, so I think that's probably OK.

1376
00:54:46,600 --> 00:54:47,600
 Exactly.

1377
00:54:47,600 --> 00:54:48,600
 That's why it is.

1378
00:54:48,600 --> 00:54:49,600
 Is that why?

1379
00:54:49,600 --> 00:54:51,600
 So I read an article, a scientific article,

1380
00:54:51,600 --> 00:54:55,600
 by Urs A. Dierke called "Every Stainer Story,

1381
00:54:55,600 --> 00:54:58,600
 the Many Dirty Undershirts of John McClain in Die Hard."

1382
00:54:58,600 --> 00:55:02,600
 He says, "This article explores that 34 undershirts

1383
00:55:02,600 --> 00:55:07,600
 worn by Bruce Willis and his stuntmen in the 1988 action film Die Hard."

1384
00:55:07,600 --> 00:55:08,600
 OK?

1385
00:55:08,600 --> 00:55:10,600
 And they go through all of these things,

1386
00:55:10,600 --> 00:55:14,600
 and they tell you exactly what they mean and all that kind of stuff.

1387
00:55:14,600 --> 00:55:17,600
 So the dirty undershirt, according to Urs A. Dierke,

1388
00:55:17,600 --> 00:55:21,600
 is a symbol for injustice and class in other films,

1389
00:55:21,600 --> 00:55:24,600
 such as a streetcar named Desire and Rocky and Rambo.

1390
00:55:24,600 --> 00:55:27,600
 It's further tied to male sexuality and violence

1391
00:55:27,600 --> 00:55:31,600
 in films such as Bonnie and Clyde, Cruising, and White House Down.

1392
00:55:31,600 --> 00:55:34,600
 And they said that all these different shirts,

1393
00:55:34,600 --> 00:55:37,600
 they were all stained in a slightly different way

1394
00:55:37,600 --> 00:55:40,600
 so that you could know which ones were at all the different parts of the movie.

1395
00:55:40,600 --> 00:55:41,600
 Right.

1396
00:55:41,600 --> 00:55:43,600
 So you had some that are really unstained and some that aren't.

1397
00:55:43,600 --> 00:55:45,600
 And they were all numbered on a rail,

1398
00:55:45,600 --> 00:55:47,600
 and he would like, "Oh, I'm going to have number 12 today."

1399
00:55:47,600 --> 00:55:48,600
 Right?

1400
00:55:48,600 --> 00:55:51,600
 And all the stains were specific to things that had happened.

1401
00:55:51,600 --> 00:55:54,600
 And according to the article, it was a planned design process

1402
00:55:54,600 --> 00:55:57,600
 in which no stain was accidental.

1403
00:55:57,600 --> 00:55:59,600
 That is really cool.

1404
00:55:59,600 --> 00:56:01,600
 And that wasn't written by a crazed journalist.

1405
00:56:01,600 --> 00:56:04,600
 That was written by someone. That's the absolute truth.

1406
00:56:04,600 --> 00:56:06,600
 This is written by an academic, yeah.

1407
00:56:06,600 --> 00:56:08,600
 So, for instance, one of the shirts is in the Smithsonian now.

1408
00:56:08,600 --> 00:56:09,600
 Wow.

1409
00:56:09,600 --> 00:56:10,600
 So that kind of looks at 12.

1410
00:56:10,600 --> 00:56:11,600
 Yeah, he starts off with a nice, clean vest.

1411
00:56:11,600 --> 00:56:13,600
 And by the end, he's absolutely mullet.

1412
00:56:13,600 --> 00:56:15,600
 But you'd never consider that.

1413
00:56:15,600 --> 00:56:17,600
 I assumed there was one shirt. How wrong was I?

1414
00:56:17,600 --> 00:56:18,600
 Really wrong.

1415
00:56:18,600 --> 00:56:23,600
 Okay, that is it. That is all of our facts.

1416
00:56:23,600 --> 00:56:25,600
