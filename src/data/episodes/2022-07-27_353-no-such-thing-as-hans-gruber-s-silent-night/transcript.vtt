00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.760
 (somber music)

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:04.960
 - Hey everyone, welcome to this week's episode of Fish,

00:00:04.960 --> 00:00:06.360
 a very special episode.

00:00:06.360 --> 00:00:09.560
 It is our 2020 Christmas Spectacular,

00:00:09.560 --> 00:00:11.960
 recorded live at King's Place in London

00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:14.440
 to an audience of zero.

00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:17.040
 There was literally no one sitting in the room with us

00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:18.400
 in this giant hall.

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:20.200
 There were of course people live streaming it

00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:22.520
 and a huge thank you to everyone who joined us on the night

00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:24.320
 from whatever bit of the world you live in.

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:25.840
 It was a really fun night.

00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:29.260
 We had a lot of fun with Christmas crackers and presents

00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:31.880
 and we did a Q and A at the end of the show.

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:34.280
 In fact, if you wanna watch the full extended version

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:36.080
 of the show that you're about to hear,

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:40.440
 you can go to qi.com/fish and buy a ticket to the stream

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:42.760
 and it's already happened, but you can watch the show

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:45.880
 and that'll be up there until the end of the year.

00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:48.080
 In the meantime, we hope you enjoy this show

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:49.720
 and we hope you have a merry Christmas.

00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:51.960
 We know it's a tough one this year.

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:54.320
 We send you all our love and we look forward to seeing you

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:57.040
 all in the new year, hopefully live and in person,

00:00:57.040 --> 00:00:59.780
 but if not, well, we'll still be here every week

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:02.100
 on the internet, telling our favorite facts

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:03.660
 to each other and to you.

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:05.380
 All right, Dorks, we love you.

00:01:05.380 --> 00:01:07.340
 Merry Christmas and enjoy the show.

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:11.680
 (upbeat music)

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:25.740
 - Hello and welcome to another episode

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:28.360
 of No Such Thing as a Fish, a weekly podcast

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:31.580
 coming to you live from King's Place in London.

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:36.320
 - I'll edit the chairs in later.

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:37.700
 - We'll get that in.

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:39.000
 My name is Dan Schreiber.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.800
 I am sitting here with Anna Tyshinski, Andrew Hunter Murray

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:43.960
 and James Harkin and once again,

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:45.920
 we have gathered around the microphones

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:48.680
 with our four favorite facts from the last seven days

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:51.980
 and in no particular order, here we go.

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:54.600
 Starting with fact number one, and that's my fact this week,

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:57.620
 my fact is that every year in the UK,

00:01:57.620 --> 00:02:00.140
 a joke committee gets together to whittle down

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:03.860
 a short list of jokes that they think are unfunny enough

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:05.620
 to put in Christmas crackers.

00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:07.540
 - Amazing.

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:09.340
 - Yeah, there's a company called Robin Reed,

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:11.140
 which was set up by a guy called Julian Reed

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:13.780
 and every year they get together, a group of them,

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:17.340
 they sit in a room and they each read out jokes

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:19.860
 and if it gets a laugh, Julian rejects it.

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:20.700
 - Really?

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:22.220
 - He says, nope, that's not going in.

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:23.060
 - Oh, wow.

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:25.100
 - It's this big theory, which I think a lot of people know,

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:27.100
 which is that the idea of cracker jokes

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:28.620
 is that they're not meant to be funny,

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:31.460
 they're meant to be grown worthy because you don't wanna

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:34.740
 isolate anyone at the dinner table of wanting to tell a joke

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:36.380
 if they know that they might deliver it

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:37.460
 and it won't get a laugh.

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:38.940
 - And also if you're one of those kind of people

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:41.140
 who doesn't really understand jokes very well,

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:43.820
 you're not feeling bad because you're not laughing, right?

00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:46.140
 Everyone else is laughing, you're like, I don't understand.

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:46.980
 - Yeah.

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:49.500
 - I think Richard Wiseman theorized this, didn't he?

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:51.100
 Who's like, obviously a great psychologist

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:52.600
 who also talks about Christmas crackers.

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:56.020
 But the idea is that you are supposed to blame your tools.

00:02:56.020 --> 00:02:57.420
 No one is a bad workman.

00:02:57.420 --> 00:02:59.620
 You don't humiliate anyone round the dinner table

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:01.940
 that they can't deliver good jokes.

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:03.980
 So it's all the jokes fault, which is quite nice.

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:05.660
 It's a scapegoat, it's a scape joke.

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:08.100
 - Okay, who do you think laughs most at cracker jokes?

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:09.020
 - Who laughs most?

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:11.940
 - Well, which profession member laughs most at cracker jokes?

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:13.740
 - Well, comedians don't laugh at any jokes.

00:03:13.740 --> 00:03:14.580
 - No.

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:15.420
 - To be honest.

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:16.260
 - They just say that was good.

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:17.100
 (laughing)

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:19.260
 - Yeah, needs work, needs work.

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:20.100
 Don't open with it.

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:22.820
 - There was a survey.

00:03:22.820 --> 00:03:25.600
 They found a thousand people from 10 professions, okay,

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:28.780
 to take part, so a hundred from each job, right?

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:30.000
 So they got 10 kinds of job.

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.360
 And their reactions were rated into a laugh, a smile,

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:33.640
 or nothing, okay?

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:35.960
 And then they, Robin Reed released the results

00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:37.080
 of this study.

00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:39.240
 So the profession that laughed most

00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:40.840
 was funeral directors.

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:41.920
 - Oh, really?

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:44.000
 - Then doctors, then accountants.

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:47.000
 The vickers were the least likely to laugh.

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:48.520
 I can't believe they got a hundred vickers

00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:49.840
 and a hundred funeral directors

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:52.340
 and seriously got them to do this research.

00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:53.900
 - That's a fun sitcom, surely.

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:56.420
 That science lab, they all get locks in.

00:03:56.420 --> 00:03:58.300
 A hundred vickers, a hundred funeral directors.

00:03:58.300 --> 00:04:00.620
 - Yeah, we get to pull these crackers, by the way.

00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:01.460
 Yeah, why not?

00:04:01.460 --> 00:04:02.300
 We can read our shit.

00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:03.140
 - Well, I know why not,

00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:04.380
 'cause we're not allowed to touch each other

00:04:04.380 --> 00:04:05.860
 or even get close to each other.

00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:07.140
 - We can pull our own crackers.

00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:07.980
 - Okay.

00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:08.820
 - Yeah.

00:04:08.820 --> 00:04:09.660
 - Okay.

00:04:09.660 --> 00:04:10.860
 - I actually, let me pull it out now.

00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:12.180
 I'm gonna tell you something about that.

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:15.180
 - All right, it's gonna be an awkward silence now.

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:17.340
 - Oh, that lovely smell.

00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:18.180
 - So nice.

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:19.020
 - It's good, isn't it?

00:04:19.020 --> 00:04:19.920
 - Oh, nice smell.

00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:21.240
 - Oh, okay.

00:04:21.240 --> 00:04:22.620
 - Oh, God, I've got wounds here.

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:23.920
 - I've got, yeah, I've got a joke here.

00:04:23.920 --> 00:04:24.760
 - Okay.

00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:25.600
 - Yeah.

00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:28.400
 - What did Adam say on the day before Christmas?

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:32.400
 - I was born many, many thousands of years before Jesus,

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:36.280
 so this really doesn't have any application to me as a person.

00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:37.920
 - Don't touch that fucking apple.

00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:39.080
 (laughing)

00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:40.800
 - He said, "Happy Christmas, Eve."

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:42.520
 Or it's just a variation on that.

00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:43.480
 - A variation, you got it.

00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:44.320
 It's Christmas.

00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:45.160
 - Eve.

00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:46.000
 - Well done.

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:46.840
 I've got one.

00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:50.560
 - Who played Edward Scissorhands in the movie of the same name?

00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:53.160
 It was a Christian Bale, Edward Norton, Sean Penn,

00:04:53.160 --> 00:04:54.080
 or Johnny Depp.

00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:55.800
 - I don't get it.

00:04:55.800 --> 00:04:56.640
 - No.

00:04:56.640 --> 00:04:58.800
 (laughing)

00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:00.800
 - Is that one of those that you're not supposed to get?

00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:01.640
 - I think so.

00:05:01.640 --> 00:05:02.480
 I think we all--

00:05:02.480 --> 00:05:04.240
 - No, we're given facts as well.

00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:05.080
 These are trivia questions.

00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:06.080
 - Oh, right, okay.

00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:07.680
 - If we'd known about these crackers years ago,

00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:09.880
 we could, this is a goldmine of information.

00:05:09.880 --> 00:05:12.480
 - I've got one.

00:05:12.480 --> 00:05:14.480
 I'm gonna save that one for fact number four.

00:05:14.480 --> 00:05:15.720
 - Who got these crackers?

00:05:15.720 --> 00:05:16.560
 Are you really?

00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:17.400
 - No.

00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:18.240
 - Okay, here's a joke.

00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:19.080
 - Reminds me of jokes, yeah.

00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:21.640
 - Why did the oyster leave the party early?

00:05:21.640 --> 00:05:26.040
 - 'Cause he'd had a shucking bad time.

00:05:26.040 --> 00:05:27.800
 - That's really good, but no.

00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:30.520
 - 'Cause he was being really shellfish.

00:05:30.520 --> 00:05:34.760
 - These are so much better than the slightly sexist one

00:05:34.760 --> 00:05:35.600
 that I've got.

00:05:35.600 --> 00:05:37.400
 - Why did the oyster leave the party early?

00:05:37.400 --> 00:05:38.240
 - Yes.

00:05:38.240 --> 00:05:40.080
 - 'Cause he wanted to get a pearly night.

00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:42.200
 - Pearly, pearly, yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:05:42.200 --> 00:05:44.800
 No, he pulled a muscle.

00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:45.640
 - Oh.

00:05:45.640 --> 00:05:46.480
 - He pulled a muscle.

00:05:46.480 --> 00:05:47.300
 - Oh, nice.

00:05:47.300 --> 00:05:48.140
 - That's deep.

00:05:48.140 --> 00:05:48.980
 - So.

00:05:48.980 --> 00:05:49.800
 - Do you say sexy as opposed to sexy?

00:05:49.800 --> 00:05:50.840
 - Sexy, it should have been sexy, shouldn't it?

00:05:50.840 --> 00:05:51.680
 - Yeah, very sexy.

00:05:51.680 --> 00:05:54.200
 - I have the world, I had the world record

00:05:54.200 --> 00:05:56.520
 for pulling crackers on your own.

00:05:56.520 --> 00:05:59.920
 For a short amount of time earlier this year.

00:05:59.920 --> 00:06:00.760
 - Guinness world record.

00:06:00.760 --> 00:06:01.600
 - Guinness world record.

00:06:01.600 --> 00:06:04.160
 As in the guy from Guinness was there and watched me do it

00:06:04.160 --> 00:06:07.280
 and counted how many I pulled and I beat the world record,

00:06:07.280 --> 00:06:09.920
 only for it to be beaten about three hours later

00:06:09.920 --> 00:06:11.400
 by Alan Davis.

00:06:11.400 --> 00:06:12.240
 - No.

00:06:12.240 --> 00:06:15.040
 - Yeah, so we did it in a QI rehearsal.

00:06:15.040 --> 00:06:17.600
 And I was pretending to be Alan for the show

00:06:17.600 --> 00:06:19.240
 and they gave me two boxes of crackers

00:06:19.240 --> 00:06:21.320
 and saw how many I could pull in a minute.

00:06:21.320 --> 00:06:23.960
 And I, yeah, absolutely smashed it.

00:06:23.960 --> 00:06:25.680
 And then because I did so many,

00:06:25.680 --> 00:06:27.360
 they gave Alan an extra box

00:06:27.360 --> 00:06:28.880
 and then he could beat my record.

00:06:28.880 --> 00:06:29.720
 - Oh.

00:06:29.720 --> 00:06:30.560
 - That's sad.

00:06:30.560 --> 00:06:31.760
 - How many did you get?

00:06:31.760 --> 00:06:34.240
 - It was two full boxes, so it must have been 24.

00:06:34.240 --> 00:06:36.000
 - Did he manage to make a call back to HQ

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:37.480
 and say log Harken down

00:06:37.480 --> 00:06:39.280
 or did you just miss that altogether?

00:06:39.280 --> 00:06:41.160
 - No, I might have got really lucky

00:06:41.160 --> 00:06:43.280
 that when they were printing the Guinness Book of Records

00:06:43.280 --> 00:06:46.720
 in 2020, it was just in that, you know, two-hour slot.

00:06:46.720 --> 00:06:49.480
 - I wonder why you kept changing the recording schedule,

00:06:49.480 --> 00:06:50.920
 didn't you, to make sure?

00:06:50.920 --> 00:06:53.480
 - I've got another one.

00:06:53.480 --> 00:06:55.880
 - Which actress and her mother died within a day of each other

00:06:55.880 --> 00:06:57.800
 in December, 2016?

00:06:57.800 --> 00:06:59.400
 - This is genuinely in a cracker.

00:06:59.400 --> 00:07:01.880
 - It's Carrie Fisher and Debbie Reynolds.

00:07:01.880 --> 00:07:03.400
 - Debbie Reynolds, that's right.

00:07:03.400 --> 00:07:05.160
 - To be honest, the funeral directors

00:07:05.160 --> 00:07:07.120
 would have pissed themselves at that one.

00:07:07.120 --> 00:07:11.440
 - Christmas has come, you're bang on time for them.

00:07:11.440 --> 00:07:12.960
 - It's genuinely a Christmasy thing.

00:07:12.960 --> 00:07:14.200
 - What have you got?

00:07:14.200 --> 00:07:15.200
 I've had Johnny Depp

00:07:15.200 --> 00:07:17.240
 and I've had people dying within a day of each other.

00:07:17.240 --> 00:07:18.280
 - You just haven't got the joke out

00:07:18.280 --> 00:07:19.440
 with a slightly different format

00:07:19.440 --> 00:07:21.680
 and you can't tell the difference between a fact and a joke,

00:07:21.680 --> 00:07:23.000
 which is what's been holding his back for years.

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:24.480
 - Who played the role of Nelson Mandela

00:07:24.480 --> 00:07:26.480
 in the 2009 film Invictus?

00:07:26.480 --> 00:07:29.240
 What is this cracker?

00:07:29.240 --> 00:07:32.520
 - This is bullshit.

00:07:32.520 --> 00:07:33.360
 - Jesus.

00:07:33.360 --> 00:07:37.080
 - I've got another joke from Christmas Crackers.

00:07:37.080 --> 00:07:40.400
 And that is, what kind of medicine does Dracula take?

00:07:40.400 --> 00:07:42.680
 - Blood.

00:07:42.680 --> 00:07:44.040
 - The answer is, and you'll get this

00:07:44.040 --> 00:07:45.520
 in quite a lot of your crackers this year.

00:07:45.520 --> 00:07:47.840
 A lot of people will get this in their crackers this year.

00:07:47.840 --> 00:07:52.560
 The answer is con-medicine, C-O-N medicine.

00:07:52.560 --> 00:07:54.280
 Doesn't make any sense, right?

00:07:54.280 --> 00:07:56.560
 So according to Matt Parker, who is our friend,

00:07:56.560 --> 00:07:59.760
 who's a mathematician and all around good guy,

00:07:59.760 --> 00:08:04.080
 according to him, when computers write down the letters F-F-I,

00:08:04.080 --> 00:08:07.880
 okay, the FF and I'll kind of squish together.

00:08:07.880 --> 00:08:10.800
 So instead of putting them down as actual letters on their own,

00:08:10.800 --> 00:08:13.520
 they have just an F-F-I character.

00:08:13.520 --> 00:08:17.240
 So it's just one code that they put in just for the F-F-I.

00:08:17.240 --> 00:08:19.680
 Now, not all computers can read that.

00:08:19.680 --> 00:08:22.240
 Not all computers know that when they see that code,

00:08:22.240 --> 00:08:23.400
 they're supposed to put F-F-I.

00:08:23.400 --> 00:08:25.480
 So some of them just miss it out.

00:08:25.480 --> 00:08:28.840
 And so it's supposed to be coffin medicine,

00:08:28.840 --> 00:08:30.680
 but loads and loads of cracker companies

00:08:30.680 --> 00:08:32.520
 have this particular computer system

00:08:32.520 --> 00:08:34.280
 that misses out the F-F-I.

00:08:34.280 --> 00:08:35.640
 And for years and years and years,

00:08:35.640 --> 00:08:37.120
 you'll see it on the internet every year.

00:08:37.120 --> 00:08:38.360
 People see this and they're like,

00:08:38.360 --> 00:08:39.320
 I don't get this joke.

00:08:39.320 --> 00:08:40.560
 Oh, what's it mean?

00:08:40.560 --> 00:08:41.440
 What's it mean?

00:08:41.440 --> 00:08:42.240
 That's so good.

00:08:42.240 --> 00:08:44.000
 That's amazing.

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:46.440
 You know, you claimed you had alleged that yours was sexist,

00:08:46.440 --> 00:08:47.280
 even though it wasn't, it was sexy.

00:08:47.280 --> 00:08:48.200
 It wasn't, really, yeah.

00:08:48.200 --> 00:08:48.560
 But--

00:08:48.560 --> 00:08:49.440
 I don't think it was sexy.

00:08:49.440 --> 00:08:50.480
 Sorry, I've got to say.

00:08:50.480 --> 00:08:51.600
 I think it was sexy.

00:08:51.600 --> 00:08:52.360
 I was certainly aroused.

00:08:52.360 --> 00:08:54.280
 All the muscle.

00:08:54.280 --> 00:08:57.600
 Well, the person who runs the Tom Smith Cracker Company--

00:08:57.600 --> 00:09:00.600
 so Tom Smith was allegedly the person who invented crackers

00:09:00.600 --> 00:09:01.760
 150 years ago.

00:09:01.760 --> 00:09:04.680
 And his company became a company as today,

00:09:04.680 --> 00:09:06.520
 which still sells a hell of a lot of crackers.

00:09:06.520 --> 00:09:08.920
 Person who runs it said in 2005

00:09:08.920 --> 00:09:11.320
 that the only changes they've made to any of the jokes

00:09:11.320 --> 00:09:13.240
 since 1950 is going through every year

00:09:13.240 --> 00:09:15.200
 to take out the offensive ones.

00:09:15.200 --> 00:09:18.760
 So that's why they seem quite dated, yeah.

00:09:18.760 --> 00:09:22.440
 She said it's mainly things attacking the Scottish and women.

00:09:22.440 --> 00:09:24.120
 Not attacking, sorry.

00:09:24.120 --> 00:09:26.880
 Choshing in a potentially offensive way

00:09:26.880 --> 00:09:28.400
 about Scottish people and women.

00:09:28.400 --> 00:09:30.040
 And they go through, extract those.

00:09:30.040 --> 00:09:31.880
 That means for years, they were looking at the coffin

00:09:31.880 --> 00:09:35.400
 Dracula joke, going, that's good, that's nice.

00:09:35.400 --> 00:09:36.240
 It's not offensive.

00:09:36.240 --> 00:09:38.240
 Not offensive.

00:09:38.240 --> 00:09:41.000
 We should give a shout out to Peter Kimpton, who literally

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:42.160
 wrote the book on crackers.

00:09:42.160 --> 00:09:44.160
 He's written a book, A History of Christmas Crackers.

00:09:44.160 --> 00:09:46.600
 And I think he used to work for the Tom Smith Company as well.

00:09:46.600 --> 00:09:49.240
 So he went, I think he went through the company archives,

00:09:49.240 --> 00:09:51.040
 because they used to have crackers for everything.

00:09:51.040 --> 00:09:52.200
 It wasn't just for Christmas.

00:09:52.200 --> 00:09:54.200
 Or rather, I think they released them at Christmas,

00:09:54.200 --> 00:09:55.240
 but they were themed every year.

00:09:55.240 --> 00:09:58.240
 So for example, in 1882, the crackers

00:09:58.240 --> 00:10:01.160
 were featured around the Battle of Tel El Kabir

00:10:01.160 --> 00:10:02.720
 in the Anglo-Egyptian War.

00:10:02.720 --> 00:10:03.720
 That's a theme.

00:10:03.720 --> 00:10:04.440
 Wow.

00:10:04.440 --> 00:10:08.160
 In 1904, you had Tom Smith's Russo Japanese War crackers.

00:10:08.160 --> 00:10:09.480
 I didn't know what was in them.

00:10:09.480 --> 00:10:11.920
 But they had a lot of these very themed ones.

00:10:11.920 --> 00:10:14.080
 So they had suffragette ones, had spinster ones,

00:10:14.080 --> 00:10:16.840
 specifically for spinsters, which included a wedding ring,

00:10:16.840 --> 00:10:19.440
 some faded flowers, and some makeup.

00:10:19.440 --> 00:10:20.080
 Wow.

00:10:20.080 --> 00:10:20.640
 Yeah.

00:10:20.640 --> 00:10:21.360
 That's robbing it in.

00:10:21.360 --> 00:10:23.360
 What are you going to do with a wedding ring?

00:10:23.360 --> 00:10:23.720
 You're right.

00:10:23.720 --> 00:10:24.480
 Yeah, you're right.

00:10:24.480 --> 00:10:25.080
 Yeah.

00:10:25.080 --> 00:10:25.760
 It is robbing it in.

00:10:25.760 --> 00:10:26.360
 Yeah.

00:10:26.360 --> 00:10:28.160
 I even think if you're a spinster who finally

00:10:28.160 --> 00:10:30.520
 gets lucky at Christmas, manages to almost seduce someone

00:10:30.520 --> 00:10:32.240
 and then says, well, I happen to have this wedding ring

00:10:32.240 --> 00:10:33.920
 from a Christmas cracker.

00:10:33.920 --> 00:10:36.440
 That might be what puts them right off.

00:10:36.440 --> 00:10:38.880
 They also had one for the discovery

00:10:38.880 --> 00:10:42.400
 of the tomb of Tutankhamun in 1920 or whatever that was.

00:10:42.400 --> 00:10:45.960
 And in the same year, one that celebrated the Prince Edward's

00:10:45.960 --> 00:10:47.480
 World Tour.

00:10:47.480 --> 00:10:49.680
 And it was advertised with, you've met the prince,

00:10:49.680 --> 00:10:52.440
 now pull the cracker.

00:10:52.440 --> 00:10:54.520
 That's so good.

00:10:54.520 --> 00:10:57.840
 So this Tom Smith guy, it's a ledge that he invented it.

00:10:57.840 --> 00:11:00.200
 And he got the idea when he was in Paris.

00:11:00.200 --> 00:11:03.920
 And he had seen it was in baguette shots and baguette shots.

00:11:03.920 --> 00:11:06.560
 Exclusively, they sold baguettes only.

00:11:06.560 --> 00:11:08.840
 And it was little sweets wrapped up.

00:11:08.840 --> 00:11:11.360
 Why were those being sold in baguette shops then?

00:11:11.360 --> 00:11:12.880
 This is a tiny baguette you've got.

00:11:12.880 --> 00:11:14.000
 This isn't going to feed the whole family.

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:15.440
 A terrible mix up.

00:11:15.440 --> 00:11:17.000
 Yeah, they were next to the baguettes.

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:18.280
 They weren't in the baguettes.

00:11:18.280 --> 00:11:20.120
 But he saw that and he thought, that looks really interesting.

00:11:20.120 --> 00:11:22.520
 Why don't I try and apply that back to my shop back in England?

00:11:22.520 --> 00:11:23.480
 He did that.

00:11:23.480 --> 00:11:24.920
 It was inspired by the baguette, too.

00:11:24.920 --> 00:11:27.280
 Because often you get pulled.

00:11:27.280 --> 00:11:28.640
 The tug of war of the baguette.

00:11:28.640 --> 00:11:31.840
 Yeah, no, but he it's there's a lot of mythology around it, right?

00:11:31.840 --> 00:11:33.880
 Because we don't we don't know what the true story is.

00:11:33.880 --> 00:11:35.960
 And it sort of evolved over time.

00:11:35.960 --> 00:11:38.360
 So the crackling bit was supposedly he was at his house,

00:11:38.360 --> 00:11:42.160
 asleep by the fire and a log cracked.

00:11:42.160 --> 00:11:46.040
 And he woke up and went, my goodness, bangs of expectation.

00:11:46.040 --> 00:11:48.920
 And supposedly, which is what they were called for ages.

00:11:48.920 --> 00:11:52.040
 I've tried to find that term, bangs of expectation.

00:11:52.040 --> 00:11:53.880
 I can't find it before about 1960.

00:11:53.880 --> 00:11:55.680
 Yes, that's why I mean it seems like mythology, right?

00:11:55.680 --> 00:11:58.560
 It just kind of appears saying they were originally called

00:11:58.560 --> 00:12:01.400
 bangs of expectation, but I don't think it's true because they were

00:12:01.400 --> 00:12:03.880
 definitely called Cossack for a while, weren't they?

00:12:03.880 --> 00:12:06.560
 Which was apparently because the crack sounds like a Cossack's whip.

00:12:06.560 --> 00:12:09.000
 And you do see that, but that's interesting.

00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:12.560
 Actually, the the the exact wording, according to the myth of him

00:12:12.560 --> 00:12:17.080
 waking up by the fire, is he yelled, bangs of bonbons as soon as he woke up.

00:12:17.080 --> 00:12:22.880
 And then he thought, wow, that would be great inside my weird baguette thing.

00:12:23.120 --> 00:12:26.000
 And then that evolved into the cracker.

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:27.920
 I'm banned from all the bakeries now, though.

00:12:27.920 --> 00:12:29.600
 So it was his mythology, wasn't it?

00:12:29.600 --> 00:12:32.680
 Was it? Yeah, as in he said, I've invented the cracker.

00:12:32.680 --> 00:12:34.760
 I'm genius. Here's how I did it.

00:12:34.760 --> 00:12:36.800
 And he claimed to be the inventor.

00:12:36.800 --> 00:12:38.680
 And I think he did invent them, didn't he?

00:12:38.680 --> 00:12:40.520
 He did. He definitely did invent them.

00:12:40.520 --> 00:12:44.400
 There was someone else around the time who was interviewed by Henry Mayhew,

00:12:44.400 --> 00:12:47.720
 the journalist in 1850, just before Thomas Smith came along.

00:12:47.720 --> 00:12:52.440
 And he was called Gaudente Sparanjapani, which I want him

00:12:52.440 --> 00:12:54.320
 to invent of them because of that name.

00:12:54.320 --> 00:12:58.680
 And so he he was an Italian migrant and he came over and he said he invented them.

00:12:58.680 --> 00:13:02.440
 And he actually in the interview by Henry Mayhew, he gives him an Italian accent,

00:13:02.440 --> 00:13:06.080
 which I won't. But he said, yes, writes down the Italian accent.

00:13:06.080 --> 00:13:09.680
 Yeah, so it's D.E. for the it's dem for them.

00:13:09.680 --> 00:13:11.480
 Right. It's pretty crude.

00:13:11.480 --> 00:13:14.920
 He said, yes, I make detonating crackers and I'm the only man in England

00:13:14.920 --> 00:13:16.480
 skillful enough to make them.

00:13:16.480 --> 00:13:19.640
 It lives in my breast alone, the full entire secret.

00:13:19.640 --> 00:13:21.440
 And then he said what they're useful for.

00:13:21.440 --> 00:13:26.320
 And he said what happens is at parties, the pretty lady pull a sudden bang

00:13:26.320 --> 00:13:30.440
 and the lady goes, ah, wow.

00:13:30.440 --> 00:13:32.280
 Amazing.

00:13:32.280 --> 00:13:35.920
 Amazing that he kind of talking about the lady going, ah, and all that.

00:13:35.920 --> 00:13:38.680
 Because both of his daughters were really prominent suffragettes.

00:13:38.680 --> 00:13:40.760
 What made them become prominent suffragettes?

00:13:40.760 --> 00:13:43.840
 We may never know that's spooking ladies.

00:13:43.840 --> 00:13:49.720
 One of them was Maude Ancliffe, Senate, and she was once imprisoned

00:13:49.720 --> 00:13:52.880
 in Holloway for breaking the windows of the offices of the Daily Mail

00:13:52.880 --> 00:13:55.520
 because they hadn't reported a rally that had happened.

00:13:55.520 --> 00:13:59.080
 But in fairness, the newspaper paid her fine in the end and she came out.

00:13:59.080 --> 00:14:05.040
 And she was part of a group called Women's Social and Political Union.

00:14:05.040 --> 00:14:07.600
 But she left them in 1908.

00:14:07.600 --> 00:14:11.360
 She resigned because she really she thought that the people who were in charge

00:14:11.360 --> 00:14:13.160
 really weren't doing the job properly.

00:14:13.160 --> 00:14:17.320
 And then I found separately that in 1909 they made their first ever

00:14:17.320 --> 00:14:21.280
 suffragette Christmas crackers the year after she left.

00:14:21.280 --> 00:14:24.040
 That must have been such a slam.

00:14:24.040 --> 00:14:26.240
 Oh, that is a real slam because she ran.

00:14:26.240 --> 00:14:29.000
 She took over the company, Spiranya Pania's company and ran it.

00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:30.560
 And I've got a suspicion.

00:14:30.560 --> 00:14:34.200
 I don't like to cast suspicions on a true feminist, but I think she might have

00:14:34.200 --> 00:14:37.760
 just pretended to be a suffragette to sell crackers because she used to put

00:14:37.760 --> 00:14:40.840
 adverts for the cracker company in all the suffragette newspapers.

00:14:40.840 --> 00:14:45.480
 Oh, it's a good I mean, it's a good idea because who goes when they see a cracker?

00:14:45.480 --> 00:14:47.360
 Women. Where do you find lots of women?

00:14:47.360 --> 00:14:48.440
 Suffragette rallies.

00:14:48.440 --> 00:14:50.360
 It's a marketing genius.

00:14:50.360 --> 00:14:52.680
 I've got to imagine if you let off a cracker at a suffragette rally,

00:14:52.680 --> 00:14:55.200
 the uproar and the riot that would have broken out.

00:14:55.200 --> 00:14:58.400
 But actually, isn't that true about the bank that I read somewhere?

00:14:58.400 --> 00:15:02.760
 In fact, it was on the Tom Smith website that they used to put them all

00:15:02.760 --> 00:15:06.240
 together and pull them and make a massive bank to train soldiers.

00:15:06.240 --> 00:15:08.360
 What it would be like in war.

00:15:08.360 --> 00:15:09.760
 It's on their website.

00:15:09.760 --> 00:15:10.960
 I mean, that's amazing.

00:15:10.960 --> 00:15:11.840
 The Second World War.

00:15:11.840 --> 00:15:13.920
 It was where I'm getting used to the sound of gunfire.

00:15:14.800 --> 00:15:17.800
 You can only imagine how unprepared you would be for D Day.

00:15:17.800 --> 00:15:21.200
 Calling around the beach is looking for your paper crown.

00:15:21.200 --> 00:15:24.720
 Wait for the joke. Wait for the joke.

00:15:24.720 --> 00:15:26.720
 Who played?

00:15:26.720 --> 00:15:31.240
 We've got to move on shortly.

00:15:31.240 --> 00:15:34.000
 Oh, can I tell you about a giant cracker very quickly?

00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:37.000
 It's from. Oh, man, I think it's around the turn of the century.

00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:40.800
 So the around 1900, the Smith factory, they made an eight foot cracker,

00:15:41.040 --> 00:15:45.160
 which was to be pulled by a group of clowns led by the famous Harry Payne

00:15:45.160 --> 00:15:46.800
 at the Drury Lane pantomime.

00:15:46.800 --> 00:15:48.200
 It contained various things.

00:15:48.200 --> 00:15:51.200
 So the sources all differ because it was meant to be reused every night.

00:15:51.200 --> 00:15:54.920
 But it apparently contained a costume change for the whole cast inside the cracker.

00:15:54.920 --> 00:15:58.480
 Several hundred smaller crackers, which were then handed out to the children

00:15:58.480 --> 00:16:01.400
 in the audience. And then other sources say there was just a person inside

00:16:01.400 --> 00:16:05.360
 the cracker, a sort of child who just burst out of the cracker and started doing something.

00:16:05.360 --> 00:16:08.960
 Wow. But yeah, that's very dangerous because you risk snapping the child

00:16:08.960 --> 00:16:12.400
 right in half, but useful if you're a spinster,

00:16:12.400 --> 00:16:14.400
 because you have a child without having to get married.

00:16:14.400 --> 00:16:20.600
 Spinsters in the audience, spinsters night at Drury Lane.

00:16:20.600 --> 00:16:25.960
 I've actually just got I got one last thing before we move on,

00:16:25.960 --> 00:16:28.960
 which is that the crackers that I was talking about this joke committee

00:16:28.960 --> 00:16:30.680
 was run by Julian Reed.

00:16:30.680 --> 00:16:34.760
 So Julian Reed started this in 1975 when he was a young schoolboy.

00:16:34.760 --> 00:16:35.760
 He was obsessed over it.

00:16:35.760 --> 00:16:39.200
 He got a two pound fifty cracker kit and he made his own crackers

00:16:39.200 --> 00:16:42.240
 and he started making them himself and he started selling them to local shops,

00:16:42.240 --> 00:16:43.640
 built it up and built it up.

00:16:43.640 --> 00:16:48.680
 And he's become this guy who 40 Christmases later is still making crackers

00:16:48.680 --> 00:16:50.680
 for the country over 10 million go over.

00:16:50.680 --> 00:16:56.320
 So I actually emailed him to say, can you give me any extra facts about crackers?

00:16:56.320 --> 00:16:59.120
 Some of the stuff that I've already said about the committee and rejecting.

00:16:59.120 --> 00:17:02.880
 But what he's also done is he has read out to me

00:17:02.880 --> 00:17:05.520
 some of the jokes that made it through the committee this year.

00:17:05.800 --> 00:17:09.040
 That will be appearing in this year's Christmas crackers.

00:17:09.040 --> 00:17:11.680
 If you get a Robin Reed, you're going to hear a minute.

00:17:11.680 --> 00:17:14.080
 So this goes out actually that day before Christmas.

00:17:14.080 --> 00:17:16.560
 So spoiler alert, spoiler alert.

00:17:16.560 --> 00:17:18.360
 Yeah, yeah. So, yeah, apologies.

00:17:18.360 --> 00:17:20.600
 I really hope he reads out the con medicine one.

00:17:20.600 --> 00:17:25.720
 I really hope because who plays Edward Scissorhunt.

00:17:25.720 --> 00:17:30.760
 So we've become we've become WhatsApp buddies and he's been sending me voice memos.

00:17:30.760 --> 00:17:34.920
 So here here are a few of the jokes that will be appearing in this year's crackers.

00:17:35.200 --> 00:17:38.080
 This is Julian Reed, founder of Robin Reed crackers.

00:17:38.080 --> 00:17:41.120
 Why did the doughnut seller retire?

00:17:41.120 --> 00:17:43.560
 He was fed up with the whole business.

00:17:43.560 --> 00:17:48.280
 What is the best thing about deadly snakes?

00:17:48.280 --> 00:17:51.320
 They've got poisonality.

00:17:51.320 --> 00:17:56.400
 What do you call a man with a seagull on his head?

00:17:56.400 --> 00:18:00.760
 Cliff got it.

00:18:01.520 --> 00:18:04.440
 That's from the voice of the jokes of crackers.

00:18:04.440 --> 00:18:06.520
 That amazing.

00:18:06.520 --> 00:18:10.200
 Anyway, thank you to Julian for that, and we need to move on to our next fact.

00:18:10.200 --> 00:18:14.960
 So it is time for fact number two, and that is Anna.

00:18:14.960 --> 00:18:21.040
 My fact this week is that in the 1880s to defend against attacks on nativity scenes,

00:18:21.040 --> 00:18:24.760
 one priest issued knuckle dusters to his congregation.

00:18:24.760 --> 00:18:30.560
 Wow, things got pretty heated round about this time.

00:18:30.840 --> 00:18:34.880
 So this was there were a lot of riots going on round about this time

00:18:34.880 --> 00:18:37.200
 in the UK from anti-papers.

00:18:37.200 --> 00:18:39.560
 So basically, a lot of people felt like the Anglican church

00:18:39.560 --> 00:18:42.440
 was creeping back towards Catholicism and the Pope

00:18:42.440 --> 00:18:45.080
 and doing all sorts of things like putting decorations up

00:18:45.080 --> 00:18:48.680
 and doing weird blessings and worshipping idols and, you know,

00:18:48.680 --> 00:18:52.360
 all that fun frivolous stuff that the Protestant church didn't really like.

00:18:52.360 --> 00:18:54.880
 And so when, for instance, people put up

00:18:54.880 --> 00:18:59.120
 nativity scenes and did this big ceremony called the blessing of the crib,

00:18:59.280 --> 00:19:02.280
 they were often vandalised and people used to get quite violent.

00:19:02.280 --> 00:19:06.600
 And so there was a priest who issued knuckle dusters.

00:19:06.600 --> 00:19:09.000
 And you can actually see them if you go to Clevedon court,

00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:12.280
 which is in Somerset, I think, one of the knuckle dusters is on display

00:19:12.280 --> 00:19:15.520
 that he issued to the people of the state at home to say,

00:19:15.520 --> 00:19:18.000
 look, if they start trying to tear down your nativity,

00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:21.800
 you have my blessing and God's blessing to crack him in the soul.

00:19:21.800 --> 00:19:26.400
 Yeah, I mean, he must have been able to source loads of knuckle dusters,

00:19:26.400 --> 00:19:27.680
 which is quite impressive.

00:19:27.680 --> 00:19:30.000
 You had a lot of knuckle dusters around in those days.

00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:31.360
 They were a bit more common.

00:19:31.360 --> 00:19:33.880
 Were they? Yeah, I used to make them out of coins.

00:19:33.880 --> 00:19:36.720
 I used to, like, make holes in coins and then put them together

00:19:36.720 --> 00:19:40.680
 and you'd be able to give someone a bunch of fives. Nice.

00:19:40.680 --> 00:19:43.480
 And so do we know if they were used in a big battle?

00:19:43.480 --> 00:19:44.880
 I don't have any. I don't know.

00:19:44.880 --> 00:19:47.680
 It was a big battle because I found a few big battles.

00:19:47.680 --> 00:19:52.800
 So one of the main offenders of people who wanted to stop

00:19:52.800 --> 00:19:56.920
 all these processions and stuff was a guy called SB Andrew, who was in Manchester.

00:19:57.560 --> 00:20:01.080
 And I was reading a story about him in the British newspaper archives.

00:20:01.080 --> 00:20:05.280
 And this was in the sun in Thursday, the 5th of January, 1871.

00:20:05.280 --> 00:20:08.040
 And apparently there was a procession going round

00:20:08.040 --> 00:20:11.640
 and he tried to stop them from walking around with this cross.

00:20:11.640 --> 00:20:13.520
 And he just stopped them and stopped them and stopped them.

00:20:13.520 --> 00:20:15.040
 And eventually they went round.

00:20:15.040 --> 00:20:18.000
 And then the next day they've been trying to put decorations up.

00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:19.920
 And then he'd take the decorations down

00:20:19.920 --> 00:20:22.640
 and then he put the decorations up again and then he'd take them down

00:20:22.640 --> 00:20:24.320
 and they put them up again and he'd take them down.

00:20:24.320 --> 00:20:28.960
 And eventually there was a massive brawl between all these kind of church people.

00:20:28.960 --> 00:20:32.800
 And they called the police and the police came, a whole load of police came,

00:20:32.800 --> 00:20:35.560
 but they said that they had no authority inside the church.

00:20:35.560 --> 00:20:37.800
 So all they could do was sit outside the church

00:20:37.800 --> 00:20:40.840
 while everyone was having a massive scrap in his face.

00:20:40.840 --> 00:20:43.320
 And eventually no one came out, so they just left.

00:20:43.320 --> 00:20:46.320
 But this guy did get arrested and find five pounds.

00:20:46.320 --> 00:20:47.880
 Wow.

00:20:47.880 --> 00:20:52.200
 Yeah, so Nativity Thefts, modern day Nativity Thefts

00:20:52.200 --> 00:20:55.040
 and anyone trying to tamper with it is a big deal in America.

00:20:55.040 --> 00:20:58.160
 It's got to the point where churches have been fitting baby Jesus

00:20:58.160 --> 00:21:01.280
 with GPS tracking systems because people come in

00:21:01.280 --> 00:21:03.640
 and they steal the baby Jesus and they wander off.

00:21:03.640 --> 00:21:07.080
 And a lot of people, A, find it upset that baby Jesus is missing,

00:21:07.080 --> 00:21:09.080
 but B, some of them are really expensive.

00:21:09.080 --> 00:21:11.080
 So there was one church, which is in Florida,

00:21:11.080 --> 00:21:18.360
 which had a life-size ceramic Jesus, which was 1,350 pounds.

00:21:18.360 --> 00:21:21.520
 Done. Sorry, pretty hard to tell.

00:21:22.240 --> 00:21:24.240
 That's right.

00:21:24.240 --> 00:21:28.080
 Yeah, so it was very expensive and they wandered off with it,

00:21:28.080 --> 00:21:31.640
 but it was a GPS tracking system, which as soon as there's movement in Jesus,

00:21:31.640 --> 00:21:33.440
 it sets off and it starts going.

00:21:33.440 --> 00:21:36.320
 And so you can silently follow without the people knowing

00:21:36.320 --> 00:21:37.760
 that there's the GPS in there.

00:21:37.760 --> 00:21:41.640
 And he was found face-down on a carpet of a woman, so they find her.

00:21:41.640 --> 00:21:44.600
 Sorry, repeat that sentence, but better.

00:21:44.600 --> 00:21:47.840
 Face-down in the carpets of a woman.

00:21:47.840 --> 00:21:53.960
 So he was found in a nearby house, leg face-down on a carpet, not dead.

00:21:53.960 --> 00:21:55.160
 He was ceramic.

00:21:55.160 --> 00:21:57.160
 It's just something about saying in the carpet of a woman,

00:21:57.160 --> 00:21:59.960
 which I'm just absolutely fouled.

00:21:59.960 --> 00:22:00.960
 Oh dear.

00:22:00.960 --> 00:22:01.960
 Too sexy for a cracker joke?

00:22:01.960 --> 00:22:03.760
 I think it's been banned, yeah.

00:22:03.760 --> 00:22:06.760
 Do you know where Benedict Cumberbatch's first role was

00:22:06.760 --> 00:22:08.760
 in a school nativity play, like a lot of people?

00:22:08.760 --> 00:22:12.840
 Yeah, apparently he pushed Mary off stage because she was talking too long.

00:22:12.840 --> 00:22:16.160
 Wow. He still does that. It's really awkward.

00:22:16.160 --> 00:22:18.480
 The outtakes for Sherlock are insane.

00:22:18.480 --> 00:22:22.360
 I'm the first nativity ever, I don't think we've mentioned,

00:22:22.360 --> 00:22:25.560
 but it was made by a friend of the podcast in Francis of Assisi.

00:22:25.560 --> 00:22:26.560
 Oh.

00:22:26.560 --> 00:22:28.360
 He's going to guess who, yeah.

00:22:28.360 --> 00:22:29.360
 Oh, sorry.

00:22:29.360 --> 00:22:30.760
 Friend of the podcast, who could it be?

00:22:30.760 --> 00:22:32.360
 Oh, I want to know who you would have guessed now.

00:22:32.360 --> 00:22:33.360
 Everard Digby.

00:22:33.360 --> 00:22:34.360
 Everard Digby.

00:22:34.360 --> 00:22:35.360
 So sad.

00:22:35.360 --> 00:22:36.560
 William Haslet, I would have gone for it.

00:22:36.560 --> 00:22:37.560
 William Haslet.

00:22:37.560 --> 00:22:39.040
 Julian Reed, off cracker face.

00:22:39.040 --> 00:22:41.040
 Julian Reed.

00:22:41.040 --> 00:22:44.480
 Imagine, whenever people say, "What's your ideal dinner party?"

00:22:44.480 --> 00:22:47.880
 I would always say, definitely William Haslet.

00:22:47.880 --> 00:22:50.640
 Everard Digby, a Julian of cracker fame.

00:22:50.640 --> 00:22:52.840
 Just to keep the conversation spicy.

00:22:52.840 --> 00:22:55.680
 He could lob another one in anytime.

00:22:55.680 --> 00:22:57.640
 If anyone loves Julian Banzit.

00:22:57.640 --> 00:23:01.440
 No, it was St. Francis, a friend of the podcast.

00:23:01.440 --> 00:23:05.840
 And he set up the first nativity scene in a little Italian town in 1223.

00:23:05.840 --> 00:23:11.320
 And he made this manger and he got a doll that he cradled as he gave mass.

00:23:11.320 --> 00:23:14.240
 And apparently the doll, so this is what's meant to happen in nativities,

00:23:14.240 --> 00:23:17.880
 the doll rose from its eternal sleep, as dolls are usually in,

00:23:17.880 --> 00:23:21.160
 and cried real tears of joy, which obviously didn't happen.

00:23:21.160 --> 00:23:22.160
 And then people...

00:23:22.160 --> 00:23:23.960
 I mean, that sounds like Pinocchio.

00:23:23.960 --> 00:23:28.880
 Dolls on in an eternal sleep, they're just not alive.

00:23:28.880 --> 00:23:31.320
 Well, don't ruin... I mean, there might be kids watching.

00:23:31.320 --> 00:23:32.320
 Isn't that what you tell your children?

00:23:32.320 --> 00:23:33.320
 Oh, bloody hope not.

00:23:33.320 --> 00:23:37.960
 Wait, I think that's spoiling all of religion,

00:23:37.960 --> 00:23:40.120
 which is... That's a different kettle of fish, I think.

00:23:40.120 --> 00:23:41.120
 That's too big.

00:23:41.120 --> 00:23:42.120
 The doll woke up.

00:23:42.120 --> 00:23:46.200
 Imagine if you're a doll and you wake up and you're face down in a woman's carpet,

00:23:46.200 --> 00:23:47.200
 that would be surprising.

00:23:47.200 --> 00:23:51.120
 I think this is probably quite dramatic for the doll as well.

00:23:51.120 --> 00:23:53.680
 Swat team with a tracker making their way into the room.

00:23:53.680 --> 00:23:55.480
 There he is. Secure the asset.

00:23:55.480 --> 00:23:56.960
 And you got a messiah complex.

00:23:56.960 --> 00:23:58.720
 It'd be very weird.

00:23:58.720 --> 00:24:02.440
 Sorry, Anna, you were saying about St. Francis of Assisi.

00:24:02.440 --> 00:24:05.080
 Look, I was mostly done, but it is the case.

00:24:05.080 --> 00:24:07.640
 I think it's more true that apparently Francis himself

00:24:07.640 --> 00:24:10.440
 was so moved by the mass that he himself was giving

00:24:10.440 --> 00:24:13.160
 that as he spoke the word Bethlehem during it,

00:24:13.160 --> 00:24:15.560
 his voice sounded like the bleeding of a lamb.

00:24:15.560 --> 00:24:18.360
 I didn't know that was what happened when you were very moved by something.

00:24:18.360 --> 00:24:19.360
 Bethlehem.

00:24:19.360 --> 00:24:20.360
 Bethlehem.

00:24:20.360 --> 00:24:21.960
 Bethlehem.

00:24:21.960 --> 00:24:22.960
 There you go.

00:24:22.960 --> 00:24:23.960
 Very powerful.

00:24:23.960 --> 00:24:25.360
 Weird thing to record.

00:24:25.360 --> 00:24:27.560
 Weird, like, weird detail to record about that.

00:24:27.560 --> 00:24:31.920
 Was it his diary? Did he say, "I was so good in the mass today

00:24:31.920 --> 00:24:33.320
 "that I sounded like a sheep"?

00:24:33.320 --> 00:24:37.160
 I don't know. I think his mate wrote the diary.

00:24:37.160 --> 00:24:39.640
 I do actually have an nativity sheep fact.

00:24:39.640 --> 00:24:40.640
 Come on.

00:24:40.640 --> 00:24:43.080
 It's a nativity sheep and dolls, actually, so it really works.

00:24:43.080 --> 00:24:44.640
 It's a story from 2018.

00:24:44.640 --> 00:24:46.880
 The sourcing is impeccable, Metro,

00:24:46.880 --> 00:24:49.960
 but it is Amazon has pulled a sheep sex doll from its website

00:24:49.960 --> 00:24:52.920
 after a mum accidentally bought it for her son's nativity play.

00:24:52.920 --> 00:24:56.520
 It was so, OK.

00:24:56.520 --> 00:24:58.640
 I don't really know much about sheep sex dolls,

00:24:58.640 --> 00:25:00.320
 but I reckon you could get away with it, couldn't you?

00:25:00.320 --> 00:25:03.240
 Well, I know. So it's a joke gag gift, right?

00:25:03.240 --> 00:25:07.600
 It was called a stag night bonkin sheep,

00:25:07.600 --> 00:25:12.280
 and it has a big... How did she not realise when she was answering it?

00:25:12.280 --> 00:25:15.440
 I think it was sort of those customers also bought things,

00:25:15.440 --> 00:25:18.840
 because she bought a Joseph outfit, and it was also more...

00:25:18.840 --> 00:25:23.640
 So anyway, she sent her son to school with the doll blown up,

00:25:23.640 --> 00:25:27.720
 but it had a really big hole at the back end, and it was, you know...

00:25:27.720 --> 00:25:30.760
 Anyway, I'm surprised the teachers knew what it was, really,

00:25:30.760 --> 00:25:34.880
 but they refused to use it. They sent the boy home, and the woman added...

00:25:34.880 --> 00:25:36.840
 They sent the boy home!

00:25:36.840 --> 00:25:38.320
 They kept the sheep.

00:25:38.320 --> 00:25:41.120
 That's harsh, because they can't have said...

00:25:41.120 --> 00:25:43.560
 If this is a young... It was a young boy, yeah.

00:25:43.560 --> 00:25:46.000
 A seven-year-old boy, and you send them home

00:25:46.000 --> 00:25:49.680
 because they've done something wrong, you can't say the reason I'm sending you home

00:25:49.680 --> 00:25:55.080
 is because this inflatable sheep is normally had sex with my people, can you?

00:25:55.080 --> 00:25:57.000
 And that kid doesn't know what's happening.

00:25:57.000 --> 00:26:00.800
 No, I know. Well, she added her son had become really attached to it

00:26:00.800 --> 00:26:02.920
 and really liked it, and she said...

00:26:02.920 --> 00:26:05.840
 She said, "No, for heaven's sake, no."

00:26:05.840 --> 00:26:09.920
 She said, "He's probably in his room right now, stuffing Lego in the hole."

00:26:09.920 --> 00:26:11.920
 Wow.

00:26:11.920 --> 00:26:15.920
 I'm so sorry.

00:26:15.920 --> 00:26:19.920
 - Wow. - See, we do some Francis. We do this stuff.

00:26:19.920 --> 00:26:23.920
 It's lowbrow to highbrow, highbrow to lowbrow here, isn't it?

00:26:23.920 --> 00:26:28.560
 Do you know who is very pro Christian Christmas, the Merry Christmas?

00:26:28.560 --> 00:26:30.080
 - Christians. - The Pope.

00:26:30.080 --> 00:26:34.600
 Yeah, all correct. I should have closed the field a bit there.

00:26:34.600 --> 00:26:38.600
 Are you reading this from your cracker trivia?

00:26:38.600 --> 00:26:41.600
 - Someone you wouldn't expect. Richard Dawkins. - OK.

00:26:41.600 --> 00:26:43.600
 Richard Dawkins, very pro Christmas.

00:26:43.600 --> 00:26:45.600
 We found this out in an article that he wrote.

00:26:45.600 --> 00:26:47.600
 It was a letter, actually, in the new statesman that was published,

00:26:47.600 --> 00:26:52.600
 written as an open letter to David Cameron in which he wishes him Merry Christmas,

00:26:52.600 --> 00:26:55.600
 adding that he would not accept substitutes to that.

00:26:55.600 --> 00:26:57.600
 No happy holidays, no nothing.

00:26:57.600 --> 00:27:01.600
 He said, "All that happy holiday season stuff with holiday cards and holiday presents

00:27:01.600 --> 00:27:03.600
 is a tiresome import from the United States

00:27:03.600 --> 00:27:07.600
 where it has long been fostered more by rival religions than atheists."

00:27:07.600 --> 00:27:11.600
 As a cultural Anglican, so he kind of puts himself as that.

00:27:11.600 --> 00:27:14.600
 He says, "I recoil from such secular carols

00:27:14.600 --> 00:27:16.600
 as White Christmas, Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer

00:27:16.600 --> 00:27:19.600
 and the loathsome Jingle Bells, but I am happy to sing real carols.

00:27:19.600 --> 00:27:22.600
 And in the unlikely event that anyone wants me to read a lesson,

00:27:22.600 --> 00:27:26.600
 I'll gladly oblige, only from the King James version, of course."

00:27:26.600 --> 00:27:28.600
 - Jesus Christ. - Who's there?

00:27:28.600 --> 00:27:32.600
 Was David Cameron like, "Didn't even invite you, mate?"

00:27:32.600 --> 00:27:35.600
 No, he's not on anyone's dinner party list, is he?

00:27:35.600 --> 00:27:37.600
 - Dawkins or Cameron? - Dawkins.

00:27:37.600 --> 00:27:39.600
 I'd be fun. Him and Julian.

00:27:39.600 --> 00:27:42.600
 Dan, did you listen to the quote that you just read?

00:27:42.600 --> 00:27:45.600
 He's pro-classic. Oh, no, I'm modern. What am I talking about?

00:27:45.600 --> 00:27:47.600
 Yeah, I love Rudolph.

00:27:47.600 --> 00:27:50.600
 So, you know, people are always saying, are they, that Christmas,

00:27:50.600 --> 00:27:53.600
 you know, it's not quite as religious as it should be.

00:27:53.600 --> 00:27:57.600
 There's someone who said, "This festival teaches even the little children

00:27:57.600 --> 00:28:00.600
 "that are heartless and simple to be greedy.

00:28:00.600 --> 00:28:03.600
 "The tender minds of the young begin to be impressed

00:28:03.600 --> 00:28:06.600
 "with that which is commercial and sordid."

00:28:06.600 --> 00:28:10.600
 And that was written by Cappadocia and Bishop Asterius of Amasea

00:28:10.600 --> 00:28:12.600
 in 400 A.D.

00:28:12.600 --> 00:28:14.600
 - Wow. - That was amazing.

00:28:14.600 --> 00:28:17.600
 What was Saint Augustine as well, and a bit later than that,

00:28:17.600 --> 00:28:20.600
 but not much, he was saying that, "Stop giving people gifts.

00:28:20.600 --> 00:28:22.600
 "You need to give people alms instead.

00:28:22.600 --> 00:28:24.600
 "You need to give to charity. Stop giving gifts."

00:28:24.600 --> 00:28:26.600
 That was right at the start, because at the start,

00:28:26.600 --> 00:28:28.600
 they didn't really celebrate Christmas, Christians,

00:28:28.600 --> 00:28:31.600
 because in early Christianity, you wouldn't celebrate birthdays

00:28:31.600 --> 00:28:33.600
 because it was kind of a pagan thing.

00:28:33.600 --> 00:28:36.600
 And so to celebrate Jesus' birthday was just ridiculous.

00:28:36.600 --> 00:28:38.600
 So it was quite late when they did it, and even then,

00:28:38.600 --> 00:28:40.600
 they were already saying, "This is too commercial."

00:28:40.600 --> 00:28:42.600
 What? I mean, were there any shops?

00:28:42.600 --> 00:28:46.600
 But I was just trying to envisage 400 A.D. shops, though.

00:28:46.600 --> 00:28:48.600
 Sort of what you would give someone.

00:28:48.600 --> 00:28:49.600
 There wasn't wrapping paper.

00:28:49.600 --> 00:28:51.600
 There will have been, like, baguette shops, wouldn't there?

00:28:51.600 --> 00:28:54.600
 So I've always been exclusive baguette shops.

00:28:54.600 --> 00:28:56.600
 We've got to move on to our next fact, guys.

00:28:56.600 --> 00:28:58.600
 Can I give you another? Just quick.

00:28:58.600 --> 00:29:02.600
 Just it's people who don't like Christmas.

00:29:02.600 --> 00:29:04.600
 So YouGov does a lot of surveying of people,

00:29:04.600 --> 00:29:06.600
 and they ask all sorts of Christmassy questions.

00:29:06.600 --> 00:29:09.600
 So there was a survey recently, and they sort of matched people

00:29:09.600 --> 00:29:11.600
 who don't like Christmas with all the other attributes

00:29:11.600 --> 00:29:14.600
 that they know about all the people on their database.

00:29:14.600 --> 00:29:17.600
 So people who don't like Christmas are more likely to say,

00:29:17.600 --> 00:29:19.600
 "There's no point in getting married.

00:29:19.600 --> 00:29:22.600
 Over half of marriages end in divorce anyway."

00:29:22.600 --> 00:29:23.600
 They're more likely to say,

00:29:23.600 --> 00:29:25.600
 "I think the Olympics is more financial trouble

00:29:25.600 --> 00:29:27.600
 to a city than it's worth."

00:29:27.600 --> 00:29:29.600
 And they're also more likely to say,

00:29:29.600 --> 00:29:33.600
 "I don't understand what many emojis mean."

00:29:33.600 --> 00:29:38.600
 Did they only interview Richard Dawkins?

00:29:38.600 --> 00:29:43.600
 OK, it is time for fact number three, and that is Andy.

00:29:43.600 --> 00:29:45.600
 My fact is that when asked this year,

00:29:45.600 --> 00:29:48.600
 21% of people said they didn't want Christmas carol singers

00:29:48.600 --> 00:29:51.600
 visiting their home because of coronavirus.

00:29:51.600 --> 00:29:54.600
 Another 55% said they didn't want carol singers

00:29:54.600 --> 00:29:58.600
 regardless of coronavirus.

00:29:58.600 --> 00:30:02.600
 Maybe those 21% were slightly using the COVID as an excuse,

00:30:02.600 --> 00:30:05.600
 but it seems that people just don't want carol singers.

00:30:05.600 --> 00:30:06.600
 No, they hate them.

00:30:06.600 --> 00:30:09.600
 I mean, I like the sound of carols.

00:30:09.600 --> 00:30:11.600
 Would you guys say you didn't want?

00:30:11.600 --> 00:30:13.600
 I would say I do want, yeah.

00:30:13.600 --> 00:30:16.600
 I would say that this year I haven't really opened my door

00:30:16.600 --> 00:30:20.600
 to anyone other than an Amazon delivery guy.

00:30:20.600 --> 00:30:22.600
 If he was singing at the same time,

00:30:22.600 --> 00:30:24.600
 you wouldn't keep the door closed.

00:30:24.600 --> 00:30:26.600
 I've actually become quite good friends with that

00:30:26.600 --> 00:30:28.600
 by Amazon delivery guy now.

00:30:28.600 --> 00:30:32.600
 Another blow-up sheet, Mr. Harden.

00:30:32.600 --> 00:30:36.600
 Yeah, only 13% of people surveyed actively wanted carolers,

00:30:36.600 --> 00:30:38.600
 and the math doesn't quite add up,

00:30:38.600 --> 00:30:41.600
 but 11% were in the "don't know" camp, a bit indecisive.

00:30:41.600 --> 00:30:42.600
 Wow.

00:30:42.600 --> 00:30:44.600
 There is a bit of a weird thing of if you're the only audience

00:30:44.600 --> 00:30:46.600
 standing there at your front door.

00:30:46.600 --> 00:30:47.600
 It's awkward.

00:30:47.600 --> 00:30:48.600
 It is awkward.

00:30:48.600 --> 00:30:51.600
 Oh, come on, you've done Edinburgh shows like that.

00:30:51.600 --> 00:30:54.600
 We're literally doing a show with that one at the audience.

00:30:54.600 --> 00:30:57.600
 What I wouldn't give for one audience member right now.

00:30:57.600 --> 00:31:00.600
 There is a thing where people don't like them,

00:31:00.600 --> 00:31:03.600
 and there was kind of uproar in 2009.

00:31:03.600 --> 00:31:06.600
 There was this thing, it was in a place just opposite Preston,

00:31:06.600 --> 00:31:09.600
 where Neighborhood Watch distributed these cards.

00:31:09.600 --> 00:31:11.600
 They put them through people's letterboxes,

00:31:11.600 --> 00:31:13.600
 and they gave them out in cafes and pubs and stuff.

00:31:13.600 --> 00:31:15.600
 And there were cards you can put in your window saying,

00:31:15.600 --> 00:31:18.600
 "Carol singers would not welcome that house."

00:31:18.600 --> 00:31:20.600
 I'm asking if there was one person that I could stay

00:31:20.600 --> 00:31:22.600
 called "carol singer."

00:31:22.600 --> 00:31:23.600
 It would feel awful.

00:31:23.600 --> 00:31:26.600
 She lives with Bill Stickers, I believe.

00:31:26.600 --> 00:31:28.600
 Jesus.

00:31:28.600 --> 00:31:30.600
 I actually was looking up "carol singers"

00:31:30.600 --> 00:31:33.600
 in the newspaper archive, British newspaper archive,

00:31:33.600 --> 00:31:35.600
 and the only one I could find was a carol singer

00:31:35.600 --> 00:31:37.600
 who was brutally murdered about 100 years ago,

00:31:37.600 --> 00:31:39.600
 which really ruined my search terms.

00:31:39.600 --> 00:31:42.600
 Well, to be fair, there were two separate editions.

00:31:42.600 --> 00:31:45.600
 We do search the newspaper archive for "carol singer shot."

00:31:45.600 --> 00:31:48.600
 There were twice that that did happen in history,

00:31:48.600 --> 00:31:49.600
 30 years apart.

00:31:49.600 --> 00:31:52.600
 One was in 1916 in Newcastle.

00:31:52.600 --> 00:31:55.600
 There was a guy called John Nixon who shot someone

00:31:55.600 --> 00:31:57.600
 who was carol singing outside his house.

00:31:57.600 --> 00:31:59.600
 Apparently they were kind of friends,

00:31:59.600 --> 00:32:00.600
 and they might have been...

00:32:00.600 --> 00:32:02.600
 I think he might have owned a pub,

00:32:02.600 --> 00:32:03.600
 or he'd owned somewhere near a pub,

00:32:03.600 --> 00:32:05.600
 and they'd been drinking earlier that day,

00:32:05.600 --> 00:32:07.600
 and then they decided to carol sing,

00:32:07.600 --> 00:32:08.600
 and then he decided to shoot them.

00:32:08.600 --> 00:32:10.600
 Wait, so were they singing together?

00:32:10.600 --> 00:32:13.600
 No, they were singing at his property.

00:32:13.600 --> 00:32:16.600
 And then another one in 1886,

00:32:16.600 --> 00:32:19.600
 the rising sun in Clapham was a pub,

00:32:19.600 --> 00:32:21.600
 and again, the landlord shot someone

00:32:21.600 --> 00:32:23.600
 because they were carol singing.

00:32:23.600 --> 00:32:25.600
 So it's a very dangerous, dangerous thing

00:32:25.600 --> 00:32:29.600
 if you're in the turn of the 19th, 20th century.

00:32:29.600 --> 00:32:30.600
 Wow.

00:32:30.600 --> 00:32:32.600
 It's weird how the hatred goes back a long way.

00:32:32.600 --> 00:32:34.600
 So if you look them up, in 1906,

00:32:34.600 --> 00:32:36.600
 the leading article across the papers,

00:32:36.600 --> 00:32:38.600
 there was this big thing about whether carol singing

00:32:38.600 --> 00:32:41.600
 was a very annoying, and they should be banned altogether.

00:32:41.600 --> 00:32:44.600
 And there was a piece written, like a leader piece,

00:32:44.600 --> 00:32:45.600
 in, like, the...

00:32:45.600 --> 00:32:48.600
 I think the Bexhill on Sea newspaper or something saying,

00:32:48.600 --> 00:32:50.600
 "We love carol singers. This is really unfair."

00:32:50.600 --> 00:32:52.600
 And it published the letters it got in response,

00:32:52.600 --> 00:32:53.600
 and they were furious.

00:32:53.600 --> 00:32:55.600
 So it got all these letters in response to it,

00:32:55.600 --> 00:32:56.600
 publishing this thing saying,

00:32:56.600 --> 00:32:58.600
 "Look, carol singers are harmless, surely."

00:32:58.600 --> 00:32:59.600
 One of them said,

00:32:59.600 --> 00:33:02.600
 "I don't think the writer kind of experienced firsthand

00:33:02.600 --> 00:33:04.600
 the bands of carol singers so called

00:33:04.600 --> 00:33:07.600
 that have visited this town the past few Christmases."

00:33:07.600 --> 00:33:09.600
 Another, and this is 1906,

00:33:09.600 --> 00:33:11.600
 said, "Most of us who have experienced it

00:33:11.600 --> 00:33:13.600
 would be inclined to call it not carol singing,

00:33:13.600 --> 00:33:16.600
 but carol howling or carol murdering."

00:33:16.600 --> 00:33:17.600
 Wow.

00:33:17.600 --> 00:33:20.600
 And that was only 20 years after there had been a carol murder.

00:33:20.600 --> 00:33:21.600
 So that's pretty insensitive.

00:33:21.600 --> 00:33:22.600
 It really is.

00:33:22.600 --> 00:33:24.600
 1887, in the Essex Newsman,

00:33:24.600 --> 00:33:26.600
 someone said, "The singer's antics

00:33:26.600 --> 00:33:29.600
 were little better than Rowdy Burlesque,

00:33:29.600 --> 00:33:32.600
 drunken or half-drunken orgies."

00:33:32.600 --> 00:33:34.600
 That sounds quite good, actually.

00:33:34.600 --> 00:33:36.600
 It's quite something to open your door to.

00:33:36.600 --> 00:33:37.600
 You're expecting silent night.

00:33:37.600 --> 00:33:39.600
 Just singing while Shepard's watched

00:33:39.600 --> 00:33:42.600
 while you twirl your nipple pasting.

00:33:42.600 --> 00:33:44.600
 So it seems to be a thing of Christmas music.

00:33:44.600 --> 00:33:46.600
 It's another thing people really don't like

00:33:46.600 --> 00:33:47.600
 when it's too early.

00:33:47.600 --> 00:33:48.600
 So another survey,

00:33:48.600 --> 00:33:50.600
 "Do you enjoy hearing Christmas music

00:33:50.600 --> 00:33:51.600
 a month before Christmas?"

00:33:51.600 --> 00:33:53.600
 So November 25th, "Are you up for it?"

00:33:53.600 --> 00:33:55.600
 4% said, "Yes, I'm up for it."

00:33:55.600 --> 00:33:57.600
 The other 96% were not up for it.

00:33:57.600 --> 00:33:59.600
 Or maybe they would don't know, as I know.

00:33:59.600 --> 00:34:00.600
 But 5% of people surveyed

00:34:00.600 --> 00:34:02.600
 didn't want to hear Christmas music

00:34:02.600 --> 00:34:04.600
 until the 24th of December.

00:34:04.600 --> 00:34:05.600
 What?

00:34:05.600 --> 00:34:06.600
 5% surveyed.

00:34:06.600 --> 00:34:07.600
 More than we're happy to hear it

00:34:07.600 --> 00:34:09.600
 in the end of November.

00:34:09.600 --> 00:34:10.600
 Nothing until the day before.

00:34:10.600 --> 00:34:12.600
 Do you remember when you guys were in Australia

00:34:12.600 --> 00:34:14.600
 with me for the tour, for fish,

00:34:14.600 --> 00:34:15.600
 and we went to my parents' house,

00:34:15.600 --> 00:34:18.600
 and it was, I think, May or something like that?

00:34:18.600 --> 00:34:21.600
 The only thing my dad played was Christmas music.

00:34:21.600 --> 00:34:22.600
 Is that right?

00:34:22.600 --> 00:34:23.600
 Yeah, do you not remember?

00:34:23.600 --> 00:34:25.600
 I remember the day, but I don't remember the music.

00:34:25.600 --> 00:34:26.600
 It was a lovely day.

00:34:26.600 --> 00:34:27.600
 It was a lovely day,

00:34:27.600 --> 00:34:28.600
 and it was probably made better

00:34:28.600 --> 00:34:29.600
 because of the Christmas carols.

00:34:29.600 --> 00:34:30.600
 But for some reason,

00:34:30.600 --> 00:34:32.600
 the only playlist that was coming up was...

00:34:32.600 --> 00:34:33.600
 Do you know what?

00:34:33.600 --> 00:34:34.600
 I remembered why they did that.

00:34:34.600 --> 00:34:36.600
 Well, I remembered why we were at your parents' house.

00:34:36.600 --> 00:34:37.600
 It was my birthday,

00:34:37.600 --> 00:34:39.600
 and we went there as a special birthday treat to celebrate.

00:34:39.600 --> 00:34:42.600
 So they must equate me with the Messiah, I suppose.

00:34:42.600 --> 00:34:45.600
 Ah, the ceramic one, or...

00:34:45.600 --> 00:34:47.600
 Be fair, you were faced down in a car

00:34:47.600 --> 00:34:49.600
 quite early on in the day.

00:34:49.600 --> 00:34:53.600
 They had a reputation for being raunchy, though.

00:34:53.600 --> 00:34:55.600
 They were banned by the church multiple times,

00:34:55.600 --> 00:34:59.600
 and medieval Christmases were generally really, like, raucous,

00:34:59.600 --> 00:35:02.600
 and it was the 12 days where, basically,

00:35:02.600 --> 00:35:04.600
 all one big pagan drunken mess.

00:35:04.600 --> 00:35:06.600
 And a lot of the carols,

00:35:06.600 --> 00:35:07.600
 like Holly and the Ivy,

00:35:07.600 --> 00:35:09.600
 was actually a pagan fertility dance, they think,

00:35:09.600 --> 00:35:10.600
 or related to it,

00:35:10.600 --> 00:35:12.600
 so it would be accompanied by dance moves.

00:35:12.600 --> 00:35:13.600
 And I've read things that say

00:35:13.600 --> 00:35:15.600
 maybe the Holly and the Ivy equate

00:35:15.600 --> 00:35:17.600
 with male and female genitals.

00:35:17.600 --> 00:35:20.600
 And if you read the lyrics with that in mind,

00:35:20.600 --> 00:35:21.600
 things like the big thorn

00:35:21.600 --> 00:35:23.600
 that's mentioned in about verse three,

00:35:23.600 --> 00:35:26.600
 do suddenly sound quite raunchy.

00:35:26.600 --> 00:35:28.600
 And you can imagine the congregation dancing

00:35:28.600 --> 00:35:30.600
 in a bit of a sort of Beyonce way,

00:35:30.600 --> 00:35:33.600
 that maybe a 10th century priest might object to.

00:35:33.600 --> 00:35:34.600
 Yeah.

00:35:34.600 --> 00:35:35.600
 Wow.

00:35:35.600 --> 00:35:37.600
 I think that's why they do carols singing round to houses, right,

00:35:37.600 --> 00:35:39.600
 because it was banned from churches,

00:35:39.600 --> 00:35:40.600
 and they can kind of see

00:35:40.600 --> 00:35:42.600
 if they're all doing sexy dances.

00:35:42.600 --> 00:35:46.600
 There was a great one in Sri Lanka in 2016.

00:35:46.600 --> 00:35:49.600
 The church accidentally printed the wrong lyrics for Hail Mary.

00:35:49.600 --> 00:35:53.600
 They accidentally printed Tupac's version of Hail Mary,

00:35:53.600 --> 00:35:54.600
 and so they all had the lyrics.

00:35:54.600 --> 00:35:56.600
 And it is one of those things where,

00:35:56.600 --> 00:35:58.600
 when you read the lyrics, I've got them here,

00:35:58.600 --> 00:35:59.600
 there's a few bits where it says,

00:35:59.600 --> 00:36:01.600
 "This blows like a 12-gauge shorty,"

00:36:01.600 --> 00:36:03.600
 or shorty rather, so a gun,

00:36:03.600 --> 00:36:05.600
 but 12 days kind of immediately you're thinking,

00:36:05.600 --> 00:36:06.600
 "Okay, is this Christmassy?"

00:36:06.600 --> 00:36:07.600
 "This sounds Christmassy."

00:36:07.600 --> 00:36:08.600
 Okay.

00:36:08.600 --> 00:36:09.600
 "Feel me."

00:36:09.600 --> 00:36:12.600
 And God said he should send his one begotten son.

00:36:12.600 --> 00:36:13.600
 I mean, he's...

00:36:13.600 --> 00:36:14.600
 Yeah, "Feel me like you feel Jesus."

00:36:14.600 --> 00:36:15.600
 Yeah, exactly.

00:36:15.600 --> 00:36:16.600
 And the Holy Spirit in you.

00:36:16.600 --> 00:36:17.600
 It's legit.

00:36:17.600 --> 00:36:19.600
 So I imagine they got in quite a few verses into this

00:36:19.600 --> 00:36:21.600
 before realizing Tupac was behind the lyrics,

00:36:21.600 --> 00:36:23.600
 as opposed to, yeah.

00:36:23.600 --> 00:36:25.600
 You know the song Silent Night?

00:36:25.600 --> 00:36:26.600
 Yeah.

00:36:26.600 --> 00:36:27.600
 I'm sure you do.

00:36:27.600 --> 00:36:28.600
 It's written by two people.

00:36:28.600 --> 00:36:31.600
 The lyrics written by a guy called Joseph Moore,

00:36:31.600 --> 00:36:33.600
 who was a priest in Salzburg,

00:36:33.600 --> 00:36:37.600
 and the music was written by an organist called Franz Gruber,

00:36:37.600 --> 00:36:39.600
 who is from a village called Arndorf,

00:36:39.600 --> 00:36:41.600
 and became very popular, of course.

00:36:41.600 --> 00:36:44.600
 They both died, as people do.

00:36:44.600 --> 00:36:46.600
 And in 1912...

00:36:46.600 --> 00:36:47.600
 Oh, there.

00:36:47.600 --> 00:36:48.600
 Spoiler alert.

00:36:48.600 --> 00:36:49.600
 Too soon.

00:36:49.600 --> 00:36:50.600
 I'm talking about it.

00:36:50.600 --> 00:36:53.600
 That was just another one for the funeral directors.

00:36:53.600 --> 00:36:56.600
 In 1912, the Austrian Taurus Office decided

00:36:56.600 --> 00:36:59.600
 that they wanted a memorial for these two writers.

00:36:59.600 --> 00:37:02.600
 And there were loads of paintings of this guy called Gruber,

00:37:02.600 --> 00:37:04.600
 but there were no paintings of Moore,

00:37:04.600 --> 00:37:06.600
 because he hated having his painting done.

00:37:06.600 --> 00:37:09.600
 And so to get this sculpture,

00:37:09.600 --> 00:37:13.600
 they dig up his grave and take out his skull,

00:37:13.600 --> 00:37:15.600
 so that they can make a sculpture of him.

00:37:15.600 --> 00:37:17.600
 And the sculpture is still there,

00:37:17.600 --> 00:37:21.600
 and they reinterred the skull in the chapel where the sculpture is.

00:37:21.600 --> 00:37:23.600
 But that's going a long way, isn't it?

00:37:23.600 --> 00:37:25.600
 That's misinterpreting the word "sculpture."

00:37:25.600 --> 00:37:28.600
 That's insane.

00:37:28.600 --> 00:37:30.600
 Did they do a sculpture of then the skull,

00:37:30.600 --> 00:37:32.600
 or did they put flesh over it?

00:37:32.600 --> 00:37:34.600
 I think they must have got the skull and gone,

00:37:34.600 --> 00:37:37.600
 while he's got, you know, he's got big cheekbones.

00:37:37.600 --> 00:37:40.600
 Imagine not liking having your portrait done in life,

00:37:40.600 --> 00:37:42.600
 and then imagine if he could have known that after his death,

00:37:42.600 --> 00:37:45.600
 people would dig up his body to do the thing he didn't want done

00:37:45.600 --> 00:37:47.600
 even when he was alive.

00:37:47.600 --> 00:37:49.600
 He probably would have acquiesced to one in his lifetime

00:37:49.600 --> 00:37:51.600
 if he knew that was going to happen.

00:37:51.600 --> 00:37:53.600
 Franz Gruber is such a good name,

00:37:53.600 --> 00:37:55.600
 because it's almost exactly the villain of Die Hard.

00:37:55.600 --> 00:37:57.600
 I know, that's like Hans Gruber.

00:37:57.600 --> 00:38:00.600
 Because I've never seen Die Hard, but I do know about that.

00:38:00.600 --> 00:38:02.600
 And when I saw this guy who was called Franz Gruber,

00:38:02.600 --> 00:38:04.600
 I genuinely thought it was him,

00:38:04.600 --> 00:38:06.600
 and I was like, "This is the best fact I've ever heard."

00:38:06.600 --> 00:38:08.600
 Silent Night was written by Hans Gruber?

00:38:08.600 --> 00:38:12.600
 Yeah, he wrote it at the Nakatomi Plaza building.

00:38:12.600 --> 00:38:15.600
 The guy who wrote Silent Night apparently did it,

00:38:15.600 --> 00:38:17.600
 because the organ was broken,

00:38:17.600 --> 00:38:21.600
 and he needed an emergency to come up with the tune in time for Christmas.

00:38:21.600 --> 00:38:23.600
 And I think he was near Salzburg,

00:38:23.600 --> 00:38:26.600
 and so he was a vicar, wasn't he, or a priest,

00:38:26.600 --> 00:38:28.600
 and he went to this church, he was working in this church,

00:38:28.600 --> 00:38:31.600
 and the organ was quite crap, didn't work,

00:38:31.600 --> 00:38:33.600
 and so he was very good at the guitar,

00:38:33.600 --> 00:38:35.600
 and so instead it was supposed to be a company by the guitar

00:38:35.600 --> 00:38:38.600
 in its early days, and then it became more acapella.

00:38:38.600 --> 00:38:41.600
 But it was so popular, within 30 years,

00:38:41.600 --> 00:38:43.600
 there was a version along the Labrador Coast

00:38:43.600 --> 00:38:45.600
 where it was translated into Inuktitut,

00:38:45.600 --> 00:38:48.600
 as in like the Inuit language, in 30 years.

00:38:48.600 --> 00:38:51.600
 Oh my God, and you know why they went to the organ?

00:38:51.600 --> 00:38:53.600
 So they were playing it on the guitar,

00:38:53.600 --> 00:38:55.600
 but the guitar was banned from churches.

00:38:55.600 --> 00:38:57.600
 It wasn't seen as a church instrument,

00:38:57.600 --> 00:39:00.600
 so you could only allow it to play certain instruments in church.

00:39:00.600 --> 00:39:02.600
 He wrote it on the guitar, they wouldn't let him play it,

00:39:02.600 --> 00:39:04.600
 so he played it outside,

00:39:04.600 --> 00:39:06.600
 and then that's why he had to get the organist in.

00:39:06.600 --> 00:39:09.600
 I didn't know that carols used to be for all occasions,

00:39:09.600 --> 00:39:11.600
 much like crackers, they were just themed differently,

00:39:11.600 --> 00:39:14.600
 so there were Easter carols, there were New Year carols.

00:39:14.600 --> 00:39:17.600
 Was the one for the Anglo-Egyptian War of 18, whatever it was?

00:39:17.600 --> 00:39:20.600
 Okay, there wasn't, but there was a Battle of Agincourt carol.

00:39:20.600 --> 00:39:21.600
 No way.

00:39:21.600 --> 00:39:23.600
 Yes, there was a carol that was written

00:39:23.600 --> 00:39:25.600
 after the Battle of Agincourt in 1415.

00:39:25.600 --> 00:39:26.600
 Oh, so not for it.

00:39:26.600 --> 00:39:29.600
 No one was running out of the front with their guitar.

00:39:29.600 --> 00:39:31.600
 No, sadly, I think they waited until the result was in

00:39:31.600 --> 00:39:33.600
 before they commemorated it in song,

00:39:33.600 --> 00:39:35.600
 because otherwise that's cocky.

00:39:35.600 --> 00:39:38.600
 In the Second World War, carol singers kept going,

00:39:38.600 --> 00:39:40.600
 but they were a bit restricted,

00:39:40.600 --> 00:39:43.600
 and so to be safe during the blackout in Britain,

00:39:43.600 --> 00:39:45.600
 in World War II, in London specifically,

00:39:45.600 --> 00:39:47.600
 they weren't allowed to carry lanterns around with them

00:39:47.600 --> 00:39:48.600
 when it kind of lights,

00:39:48.600 --> 00:39:50.600
 so they couldn't actually read their hym sheets at all,

00:39:50.600 --> 00:39:54.600
 and you couldn't see them, obviously, when you open the door.

00:39:54.600 --> 00:39:57.600
 And they also issued with a government warning

00:39:57.600 --> 00:40:01.600
 that they mustn't warble like air raid sirens.

00:40:01.600 --> 00:40:04.600
 That's a bad singing, if you can't tell the difference

00:40:04.600 --> 00:40:06.600
 between a carol singing and an air raid siren.

00:40:06.600 --> 00:40:08.600
 People flocking to the underground

00:40:08.600 --> 00:40:10.600
 every time they're all dancing.

00:40:10.600 --> 00:40:12.600
 No, no, no. It's okay.

00:40:12.600 --> 00:40:15.600
 I suppose that bit that goes, blah, blah, blah.

00:40:15.600 --> 00:40:17.600
 That does sound a bit like it.

00:40:17.600 --> 00:40:19.600
 It does sound like it, yeah.

00:40:19.600 --> 00:40:22.600
 We've got to move on in the set, guys, for our final fact.

00:40:22.600 --> 00:40:23.600
 I'll tell you what.

00:40:23.600 --> 00:40:26.600
 While I was searching for carol singer shot

00:40:26.600 --> 00:40:28.600
 on the newspaper archives,

00:40:28.600 --> 00:40:30.600
 I came across an article in The Sun

00:40:30.600 --> 00:40:33.600
 from Thursday the 5th of January, 1871,

00:40:33.600 --> 00:40:35.600
 and they had a Christmas cracker joke.

00:40:35.600 --> 00:40:36.600
 Do you want to hear it?

00:40:36.600 --> 00:40:37.600
 Yeah.

00:40:37.600 --> 00:40:38.600
 Because we did that before.

00:40:38.600 --> 00:40:41.600
 What ancient author is supposed to have written

00:40:41.600 --> 00:40:43.600
 a treatise on plum pudding?

00:40:43.600 --> 00:40:45.600
 I think I've got it.

00:40:45.600 --> 00:40:46.600
 Have you?

00:40:46.600 --> 00:40:47.600
 Is it Suetonius?

00:40:47.600 --> 00:40:49.600
 It's Suetonius.

00:40:49.600 --> 00:40:51.600
 Isn't that amazing?

00:40:51.600 --> 00:40:54.600
 That is in The Sun in 1871.

00:40:54.600 --> 00:40:55.600
 The Sun's changed, hasn't it?

00:40:55.600 --> 00:40:56.600
 It's amazing.

00:40:56.600 --> 00:40:59.600
 And just for anyone watching who doesn't get that,

00:40:59.600 --> 00:41:02.600
 can we explain what that means?

00:41:02.600 --> 00:41:03.600
 I don't think so.

00:41:03.600 --> 00:41:05.600
 Suetonius is a type of pastry

00:41:05.600 --> 00:41:07.600
 that's made out of animal innards.

00:41:07.600 --> 00:41:09.600
 And Suetonius was an orator.

00:41:09.600 --> 00:41:11.600
 Classical writer.

00:41:11.600 --> 00:41:13.600
 You're welcome.

00:41:13.600 --> 00:41:16.600
 In the same article, by the way,

00:41:16.600 --> 00:41:18.600
 it said the noticeable feature of Liverpool police sheets

00:41:18.600 --> 00:41:21.600
 on Monday was the fact that only 66 persons

00:41:21.600 --> 00:41:25.600
 had been booked for being drunk and disorderly.

00:41:25.600 --> 00:41:26.600
 Good numbers.

00:41:26.600 --> 00:41:28.600
 Small victories.

00:41:28.600 --> 00:41:30.600
 OK, should we move on to our final fact?

00:41:30.600 --> 00:41:31.600
 Yes.

00:41:31.600 --> 00:41:33.600
 All right, it is time for our final fact of the show,

00:41:33.600 --> 00:41:35.600
 and that is James.

00:41:35.600 --> 00:41:38.600
 OK, my fact this week is that Jim carries makeup

00:41:38.600 --> 00:41:41.600
 for the Grinch was so onerous to apply,

00:41:41.600 --> 00:41:44.600
 the studio brought in one of the CIA's experts

00:41:44.600 --> 00:41:47.600
 at Enduring Torture to help him get through it.

00:41:47.600 --> 00:41:51.600
 So yeah, this is about Jim Carrey and the making of the Grinch.

00:41:51.600 --> 00:41:54.600
 And he had so much makeup on.

00:41:54.600 --> 00:41:57.600
 He said it was like being buried alive.

00:41:57.600 --> 00:42:00.600
 The main guy who was in charge of it was Ron Howard, the director.

00:42:00.600 --> 00:42:03.600
 And he had a partner who was a producer called Brian Grazer.

00:42:03.600 --> 00:42:06.600
 And Brian Grazer had a friend who was from the CIA,

00:42:06.600 --> 00:42:10.600
 and he was a specialised in kind of helping people get through torture.

00:42:10.600 --> 00:42:13.600
 And he spent the weekend with Jim Carrey saying,

00:42:13.600 --> 00:42:16.600
 this is the way that you have to sit through hours and hours and hours.

00:42:16.600 --> 00:42:20.600
 It was eight and a half hours that he had to sit there having this makeup on.

00:42:20.600 --> 00:42:21.600
 That's a lot.

00:42:21.600 --> 00:42:22.600
 He got taught how to do it.

00:42:22.600 --> 00:42:25.600
 And Carrey said at first that he thought it was quite hilarious,

00:42:25.600 --> 00:42:28.600
 but in the end, you know, it did the job and they made the film.

00:42:28.600 --> 00:42:30.600
 Because he said that he wasn't going to do the film.

00:42:30.600 --> 00:42:31.600
 You know, he said this is too much.

00:42:31.600 --> 00:42:34.600
 Yeah, he said he had to sort of become a Zen master.

00:42:34.600 --> 00:42:38.600
 He had to train himself to just be at peace.

00:42:38.600 --> 00:42:40.600
 The guy, the CIA guy had to teach him a lot of things.

00:42:40.600 --> 00:42:42.600
 One of the main things was distraction.

00:42:42.600 --> 00:42:45.600
 He was saying, and there's a clip of Jim Carrey talking about this

00:42:45.600 --> 00:42:47.600
 on The Graham Norton Show where he really goes into it,

00:42:47.600 --> 00:42:50.600
 where he says, you just have to punch yourself at times, just at random.

00:42:50.600 --> 00:42:52.600
 Just go, it hit yourself in the leg.

00:42:52.600 --> 00:42:56.600
 Suddenly just get up to check something, do something very different.

00:42:56.600 --> 00:42:58.600
 He did a lot of smoking while he was doing it.

00:42:58.600 --> 00:43:03.600
 This is not describing the Zen monk that I have in my mind.

00:43:03.600 --> 00:43:08.600
 But the stress of it with the smoking was just to get through the stress.

00:43:08.600 --> 00:43:11.600
 But the problem was, is that he was wearing this really thick grinch suit,

00:43:11.600 --> 00:43:13.600
 which was made of yak hair.

00:43:13.600 --> 00:43:15.600
 And so he had to have a really long extended pipe.

00:43:15.600 --> 00:43:17.600
 So he was sitting there sort of going on.

00:43:17.600 --> 00:43:20.600
 That's so Dr. Sussian, isn't it?

00:43:20.600 --> 00:43:24.600
 But then of course the movie did go on to win the Oscar for best makeup.

00:43:24.600 --> 00:43:26.600
 So it was all worth it in the end.

00:43:26.600 --> 00:43:27.600
 Is it?

00:43:27.600 --> 00:43:29.600
 Will he have been happy about the best makeup Oscar?

00:43:29.600 --> 00:43:31.600
 Because it feels like it's a bit of a slap in the face.

00:43:31.600 --> 00:43:35.600
 And apparently they're saying all the stuff around your body is getting an award.

00:43:35.600 --> 00:43:36.600
 And you are not.

00:43:36.600 --> 00:43:38.600
 Yeah, but I'll be honest.

00:43:38.600 --> 00:43:43.600
 I don't think that his performance in the Grinch probably was going to win best actor in the Oscars.

00:43:43.600 --> 00:43:46.600
 Yeah, I started watching it as research for this fact.

00:43:46.600 --> 00:43:50.600
 And I can say that I've seen the first six minutes of the film.

00:43:50.600 --> 00:43:53.600
 Would you describe the makeup as deserving of a best actor role?

00:43:53.600 --> 00:43:55.600
 Makeup is incredible, yeah.

00:43:55.600 --> 00:43:56.600
 Yeah, regardless of the movie.

00:43:56.600 --> 00:44:02.600
 So the guy who did it is called Kazuhiro Tsuji, and he's an amazing sort of legend of the makeup world.

00:44:02.600 --> 00:44:05.600
 And he said that, yeah, Kerry was a bit of a nightmare to work with.

00:44:05.600 --> 00:44:08.600
 And that, I mean, it sounds horrible being under all this makeup.

00:44:08.600 --> 00:44:10.600
 It sounds really, really restrictive.

00:44:10.600 --> 00:44:16.600
 But Kerry apparently sometimes said, you're painting me a different color to the color you painted me yesterday.

00:44:16.600 --> 00:44:20.600
 And Tsuji obviously wanted to say, why would I do that?

00:44:20.600 --> 00:44:24.600
 Why on this big budget Hollywood film would I paint you a different color?

00:44:24.600 --> 00:44:29.600
 Imagine if you started watching it, and you're just like, wait a minute, I just went from green to red.

00:44:29.600 --> 00:44:30.600
 It used to be green.

00:44:30.600 --> 00:44:33.600
 And Kerry kept saying, you've got to fix it.

00:44:33.600 --> 00:44:34.600
 You've got to fix this.

00:44:34.600 --> 00:44:37.600
 And he said in an interview, so I fixed it.

00:44:37.600 --> 00:44:40.600
 I kept painting it the same color, you know, claimed it was different.

00:44:40.600 --> 00:44:41.600
 Yeah.

00:44:41.600 --> 00:44:47.600
 Fittingly, actually, I think he only took that job in exchange for a green card.

00:44:47.600 --> 00:44:50.600
 So if anyone knew about the color green, it was this guy.

00:44:50.600 --> 00:44:51.600
 Brilliant, brilliant.

00:44:51.600 --> 00:44:53.600
 It's not quite that, actually.

00:44:53.600 --> 00:44:56.600
 No, no, no, that's absolutely true.

00:44:56.600 --> 00:44:57.600
 It's not why he took the job.

00:44:57.600 --> 00:45:01.600
 He took the job because he was offered it and he thought this would be great.

00:45:01.600 --> 00:45:08.600
 He was doing the job, but the stress that Jim Kerry put him under during this job was so intense that he had to quit.

00:45:08.600 --> 00:45:12.600
 And he actually had to get a bit of therapy because Jim Kerry was kicking his foot through.

00:45:12.600 --> 00:45:16.600
 This is before he was then monk-like and had a CIA guy come in, I think.

00:45:16.600 --> 00:45:20.600
 The guy, this makeup artist says he was a real dick on the set.

00:45:20.600 --> 00:45:22.600
 He was rude to everyone.

00:45:22.600 --> 00:45:24.600
 And Jim Kerry goes very method.

00:45:24.600 --> 00:45:28.600
 It's hard to know if he thought he was the Grinch and he was embodying that character.

00:45:28.600 --> 00:45:29.600
 What an excuse.

00:45:29.600 --> 00:45:30.600
 Come on.

00:45:30.600 --> 00:45:35.600
 Well, there's a very famous documentary, which I'll mention in a second, but just to finish that,

00:45:35.600 --> 00:45:42.600
 he basically sent this guy off the movie because he was so traumatized by Jim Kerry, how he spoke to him and everyone else.

00:45:42.600 --> 00:45:48.600
 So he was off for a couple of weeks and Jim Kerry called him up himself and so did Ron Howard and said,

00:45:48.600 --> 00:45:53.600
 "Please come back. I've worked on my temper. I'm zen-like now. Please come back and do it."

00:45:53.600 --> 00:45:54.600
 And he said, "Okay, I will."

00:45:54.600 --> 00:45:56.600
 And his friends said to him, "Why don't you do it for more money?"

00:45:56.600 --> 00:45:58.600
 He said, "I don't want to ask for more money."

00:45:58.600 --> 00:46:01.600
 But then he went, "Okay, I'll tell you what though. I'll do it for a green card."

00:46:01.600 --> 00:46:03.600
 And that's how...

00:46:03.600 --> 00:46:05.600
 So you can work in America?

00:46:05.600 --> 00:46:06.600
 Yes.

00:46:06.600 --> 00:46:09.600
 Well, then I think they didn't even give him the green card until he got the BAFTA.

00:46:09.600 --> 00:46:10.600
 It was a hard one thing.

00:46:10.600 --> 00:46:11.600
 The BAFTA or the Oscar?

00:46:11.600 --> 00:46:17.600
 No, it was BAFTA, weirdly, but it was quite a big deal for once the BAFTA was in America then in that one year.

00:46:17.600 --> 00:46:20.600
 So he got a BAFTA for the makeup and then they gave him a green card.

00:46:20.600 --> 00:46:23.600
 But that was a high bar to have to pass.

00:46:23.600 --> 00:46:28.600
 So the movie you're talking about where he goes method is called Jim and Andy, isn't it?

00:46:28.600 --> 00:46:31.600
 Well, the movie was Man on the Moon where he plays Andy Kaufman.

00:46:31.600 --> 00:46:32.600
 But yeah, there was a documentary.

00:46:32.600 --> 00:46:38.600
 They did a documentary where it was like that, but he got the job while he was working on Man on the Moon, didn't he?

00:46:38.600 --> 00:46:48.600
 And Audrey Geisel, who was Dr. Seuss's wife, went to visit him while he was doing that movie and tried to decide if he was going to get the job.

00:46:48.600 --> 00:46:56.600
 Now, he was doing this movie pretending to be Andy Kaufman and was so method that he wouldn't respond to Jim Carrey.

00:46:56.600 --> 00:47:01.600
 He would only respond to Andy Kaufman and he would just pretend to be him completely.

00:47:01.600 --> 00:47:04.600
 Basically, for the whole making this movie, he was Andy Kaufman.

00:47:04.600 --> 00:47:09.600
 And so when Audrey Geisel came to interview him and said, "Do you want to do the Grinch?"

00:47:09.600 --> 00:47:18.600
 The only way she could find out what he would be like was if Andy Kaufman did an impression of Jim Carrey who was doing an impression of being the Grinch.

00:47:18.600 --> 00:47:19.600
 Yes.

00:47:19.600 --> 00:47:20.600
 Wow.

00:47:20.600 --> 00:47:21.600
 Yeah.

00:47:21.600 --> 00:47:23.600
 There's a dog in the Grinch.

00:47:23.600 --> 00:47:25.600
 The Grinch has a dog.

00:47:25.600 --> 00:47:27.600
 But it looks pretty normal.

00:47:27.600 --> 00:47:30.600
 Certainly in the first six minutes, there are some interactions between the Grinch and his dog.

00:47:30.600 --> 00:47:33.600
 And I found out later the dog is voiced by a human.

00:47:33.600 --> 00:47:35.600
 And you can use the dog's box.

00:47:35.600 --> 00:47:36.600
 That's disgusting.

00:47:36.600 --> 00:47:38.600
 It's putting dogs out of business as humans.

00:47:38.600 --> 00:47:39.600
 Yeah.

00:47:39.600 --> 00:47:41.600
 It's a guy called Frank Welker.

00:47:41.600 --> 00:47:42.600
 Oh.

00:47:42.600 --> 00:47:43.600
 Frank Welker, yeah.

00:47:43.600 --> 00:47:44.600
 Oh, okay.

00:47:44.600 --> 00:47:45.600
 Does he do a lot of dogs?

00:47:45.600 --> 00:47:49.600
 Frank Welker's probably got more Hollywood box office hits behind him than any actor alive.

00:47:49.600 --> 00:47:50.600
 Huge claim.

00:47:50.600 --> 00:47:51.600
 Huge.

00:47:51.600 --> 00:47:53.600
 Well, I mean, so this is the thing.

00:47:53.600 --> 00:47:56.600
 He does have form in playing dogs because he also played Scooby-Doo.

00:47:56.600 --> 00:47:57.600
 Oh, there you go.

00:47:57.600 --> 00:47:58.600
 Yeah.

00:47:58.600 --> 00:47:59.600
 So maybe it's his thing.

00:47:59.600 --> 00:48:00.600
 Can I go to Frank Welker's IMDB?

00:48:00.600 --> 00:48:02.600
 He is the most successful actor on earth.

00:48:02.600 --> 00:48:05.600
 I can't believe this because surely we would have heard of him more.

00:48:05.600 --> 00:48:07.600
 No, because he does voices.

00:48:07.600 --> 00:48:11.600
 It's like Andy Serkis before we found out his name and he was Gollum and King Kong.

00:48:11.600 --> 00:48:12.600
 Yeah, yeah.

00:48:12.600 --> 00:48:14.600
 Well, this is a bit like the original Grinch, right?

00:48:14.600 --> 00:48:20.600
 Thel Ravenscroft was the voice of the Grinch and he was Tony the Tiger and lots of other people.

00:48:20.600 --> 00:48:24.600
 But people didn't know that because, sorry, he sung the Grinch's songs.

00:48:24.600 --> 00:48:27.600
 But Boris Karloff was the Grinch's normal voice.

00:48:27.600 --> 00:48:28.600
 So cool.

00:48:28.600 --> 00:48:30.600
 Which, well, that's what cool that he was.

00:48:30.600 --> 00:48:31.600
 Frankenstein.

00:48:31.600 --> 00:48:32.600
 Yeah.

00:48:32.600 --> 00:48:33.600
 The Mummy.

00:48:33.600 --> 00:48:35.600
 It is very cool, but then he got all the credit.

00:48:35.600 --> 00:48:37.600
 So it was reported as him being the Grinch.

00:48:37.600 --> 00:48:40.600
 Whereas actually the main song was sung by Tony the Tiger.

00:48:40.600 --> 00:48:44.600
 And it was great.

00:48:44.600 --> 00:48:47.600
 Can I give you another joke from our crackers earlier on?

00:48:47.600 --> 00:48:48.600
 Yeah, you were saving one.

00:48:48.600 --> 00:48:49.600
 Yeah, it's this one.

00:48:49.600 --> 00:48:52.600
 What is the name of the Grinch's dog?

00:48:52.600 --> 00:48:53.600
 It's A. Ben.

00:48:53.600 --> 00:48:54.600
 B. Max.

00:48:54.600 --> 00:48:55.600
 C. Sam.

00:48:55.600 --> 00:48:57.600
 Or D. Buddy.

00:48:57.600 --> 00:49:02.600
 I literally watched the film and I have a note about the dog and Dan is the one who knows.

00:49:02.600 --> 00:49:03.600
 I'm so upset.

00:49:03.600 --> 00:49:04.600
 What is it?

00:49:04.600 --> 00:49:05.600
 I'm going for Max.

00:49:05.600 --> 00:49:08.600
 Oh, I'll say Dan knows the answer.

00:49:08.600 --> 00:49:10.600
 I mean, go for something else if you want.

00:49:10.600 --> 00:49:11.600
 I'll say Buddy.

00:49:11.600 --> 00:49:12.600
 I'll spin it all.

00:49:12.600 --> 00:49:13.600
 Put everything on Buddy.

00:49:13.600 --> 00:49:15.600
 It's Max.

00:49:15.600 --> 00:49:17.600
 The Grinch wasn't green originally.

00:49:17.600 --> 00:49:19.600
 He was black and white with pink eyes.

00:49:19.600 --> 00:49:20.600
 Yeah.

00:49:20.600 --> 00:49:23.600
 I'm not sure if that's with pink eyes or with pink eye, the medical condition.

00:49:23.600 --> 00:49:24.600
 I doubt it.

00:49:24.600 --> 00:49:26.600
 That wasn't what it was about, certainly.

00:49:26.600 --> 00:49:27.600
 That was a theme.

00:49:27.600 --> 00:49:29.600
 Do you know what color green he is?

00:49:29.600 --> 00:49:30.600
 What shade of green?

00:49:30.600 --> 00:49:34.600
 Is there a particular Grinch green that Dr. Seuss demanded?

00:49:34.600 --> 00:49:35.600
 Kind of.

00:49:35.600 --> 00:49:36.600
 It's ugly car.

00:49:36.600 --> 00:49:42.600
 And that's not a specific green, obviously, but the director of that film, Chuck Jones,

00:49:42.600 --> 00:49:47.600
 was inspired to use that color green because he had this ugly car that he rented that was

00:49:47.600 --> 00:49:49.600
 this horrible shade of green.

00:49:49.600 --> 00:49:52.600
 And he went, actually, that would look amazing on my Grinch.

00:49:52.600 --> 00:49:53.600
 Wow.

00:49:53.600 --> 00:49:55.600
 And he picked that exact color and put it on the Grinch.

00:49:55.600 --> 00:49:59.600
 Actually, speaking of Grinch-related cars, Audrey Geisel, who we're talking about, who,

00:49:59.600 --> 00:50:05.600
 sadly, she died a couple of years ago, but at the age of 97, and she ran all of the Dr.

00:50:05.600 --> 00:50:09.600
 Seuss estate for quite a long time, she had a Cadillac that she would drive around with

00:50:09.600 --> 00:50:11.600
 with the number plate that read Grinch.

00:50:11.600 --> 00:50:12.600
 Wow.

00:50:12.600 --> 00:50:13.600
 Psycho.

00:50:13.600 --> 00:50:19.600
 It's not Grinch posters, sort of, Reformation of Character or Pre is what I'd want to know.

00:50:19.600 --> 00:50:26.600
 I think deep down, the Grinch is a good guy who is misunderstood at the start, right?

00:50:26.600 --> 00:50:30.600
 Because there were two kids, two little boys called Bob and David Grinch from New Jersey.

00:50:30.600 --> 00:50:35.600
 They wrote a letter to Dr. Seuss saying everyone makes fun of them all the time because they're

00:50:35.600 --> 00:50:36.600
 called the Grinch brothers.

00:50:36.600 --> 00:50:40.600
 And he wrote back to them saying, no, the Grinch is a hero, a changed man.

00:50:40.600 --> 00:50:43.600
 Tell the other kids it's not where you start, it's where you end up.

00:50:43.600 --> 00:50:50.600
 That's a hard message when your head is being flushed down a toilet to articulate.

00:50:50.600 --> 00:50:54.600
 And I looked into some makeup, a little bit of movie makeup stuff.

00:50:54.600 --> 00:50:55.600
 Oh, yeah.

00:50:55.600 --> 00:50:58.600
 And so traumatizing makeup experiences in films.

00:50:58.600 --> 00:51:04.600
 And I think the prize goes to the person who played the Tin Man in Wizard of Oz originally,

00:51:04.600 --> 00:51:05.600
 who was Buddy Ebson.

00:51:05.600 --> 00:51:08.600
 So the Tin Man in the Wizard of Oz was extremely intense.

00:51:08.600 --> 00:51:12.600
 It was one of those, took five hours to put the makeup on every morning, and then five

00:51:12.600 --> 00:51:13.600
 hours to take it off again.

00:51:13.600 --> 00:51:15.600
 And you don't know when they even got the acting in.

00:51:15.600 --> 00:51:19.600
 And eventually he got really ill from all these aluminium powder fumes.

00:51:19.600 --> 00:51:21.600
 He was ingesting and inhaling.

00:51:21.600 --> 00:51:23.600
 And he woke up in the middle of the night screaming.

00:51:23.600 --> 00:51:25.600
 And he had violent cramping all over his body.

00:51:25.600 --> 00:51:26.600
 And he was rushed to hospital.

00:51:26.600 --> 00:51:28.600
 He was in this oxygen tent for weeks.

00:51:28.600 --> 00:51:31.600
 And did they find he didn't have a heart?

00:51:31.600 --> 00:51:33.600
 That was both about the Tin Man.

00:51:33.600 --> 00:51:37.600
 The thing is, Andy, spoiler alert, he did have a heart all along.

00:51:37.600 --> 00:51:38.600
 Did he?

00:51:38.600 --> 00:51:39.600
 I think.

00:51:39.600 --> 00:51:40.600
 Wait, was that it?

00:51:40.600 --> 00:51:41.600
 Oh God, it's been a long time.

00:51:41.600 --> 00:51:42.600
 Does he?

00:51:42.600 --> 00:51:43.600
 I've got Tin.

00:51:43.600 --> 00:51:45.600
 They don't tear out someone's heart, do they, in the film?

00:51:45.600 --> 00:51:46.600
 It's been a while since I've seen it.

00:51:46.600 --> 00:51:48.600
 But I'd be really surprised if it ended with that.

00:51:48.600 --> 00:51:50.600
 I think the lesson is he doesn't need a heart.

00:51:50.600 --> 00:51:52.600
 I think, does he get like a medal of a heart?

00:51:52.600 --> 00:51:53.600
 Or is that the courage for the lion?

00:51:53.600 --> 00:51:55.600
 Thousands of people in the comments are screaming right now.

00:51:55.600 --> 00:51:56.600
 Oh my God.

00:51:56.600 --> 00:51:57.600
 Sorry.

00:51:57.600 --> 00:51:58.600
 Thousands.

00:51:58.600 --> 00:52:01.600
 Well, he, so he didn't need a heart, but he did need the use of his lungs,

00:52:01.600 --> 00:52:02.600
 which he didn't have for a while.

00:52:02.600 --> 00:52:04.600
 And his skin turned blue.

00:52:04.600 --> 00:52:05.600
 And the studio just wouldn't believe it.

00:52:05.600 --> 00:52:07.600
 So the studio were like, no, this is rubbish.

00:52:07.600 --> 00:52:08.600
 You're just malingering.

00:52:08.600 --> 00:52:09.600
 Come back in.

00:52:09.600 --> 00:52:11.600
 You sent someone to the hospital, I think,

00:52:11.600 --> 00:52:14.600
 or to his home when he was just of emerging from this coma to say,

00:52:14.600 --> 00:52:16.600
 you've got to come back and do the acting.

00:52:16.600 --> 00:52:19.600
 And a nurse said, no, no, no, he really is in a bad way.

00:52:19.600 --> 00:52:21.600
 And so they replaced him.

00:52:21.600 --> 00:52:23.600
 And not only did they replace him with this guy, Jack Haley,

00:52:23.600 --> 00:52:24.600
 who played the Tin man,

00:52:24.600 --> 00:52:29.600
 but they never told Jack Haley why the last person had resigned.

00:52:29.600 --> 00:52:31.600
 That's incredible.

00:52:31.600 --> 00:52:35.600
 I've got a makeup fact about the Grinch.

00:52:35.600 --> 00:52:36.600
 Oh, great.

00:52:36.600 --> 00:52:37.600
 Mr. Grinch makeup.

00:52:37.600 --> 00:52:38.600
 Kazuhiro Tsuji.

00:52:38.600 --> 00:52:39.600
 So he's done a few things.

00:52:39.600 --> 00:52:40.600
 He did Men in Black.

00:52:40.600 --> 00:52:42.600
 You know when the guy is sort of a cockroach turned human

00:52:42.600 --> 00:52:44.600
 and he's kind of twitchy under the skin.

00:52:44.600 --> 00:52:45.600
 Terrifying.

00:52:45.600 --> 00:52:48.600
 He designed the silicon, the live twitching silicon.

00:52:48.600 --> 00:52:50.600
 And it was, I think, silicon gel.

00:52:50.600 --> 00:52:52.600
 So it's kind of implant gel on people's faces.

00:52:52.600 --> 00:52:53.600
 So he did that.

00:52:53.600 --> 00:52:54.600
 He did Benjamin Button.

00:52:54.600 --> 00:52:55.600
 He's done all sorts of stuff.

00:52:55.600 --> 00:52:58.600
 But he also, he came out of retirement to do Churchill,

00:52:58.600 --> 00:53:02.600
 because Gary Oldman was playing Churchill a few years ago

00:53:02.600 --> 00:53:04.600
 in a film called Darkest Hour.

00:53:04.600 --> 00:53:07.600
 So he did a wig for Gary Oldman,

00:53:07.600 --> 00:53:09.600
 which has a very specific thing,

00:53:09.600 --> 00:53:13.600
 because Churchill was about mid-60s in the war, I think.

00:53:13.600 --> 00:53:16.600
 And can you guess what he used for Churchill's very fine hair

00:53:16.600 --> 00:53:18.600
 for that face of his life?

00:53:18.600 --> 00:53:21.600
 Well, it wasn't his own pubes or anything, was it?

00:53:21.600 --> 00:53:22.600
 Oh, come on.

00:53:22.600 --> 00:53:24.600
 His own pubes?

00:53:24.600 --> 00:53:28.600
 No, of course it wasn't his own pubes.

00:53:28.600 --> 00:53:30.600
 Picture Churchill in your mind's eye.

00:53:30.600 --> 00:53:31.600
 What is his hairline?

00:53:31.600 --> 00:53:33.600
 Oh, my gosh.

00:53:33.600 --> 00:53:35.600
 It's so much less good than that answer.

00:53:35.600 --> 00:53:39.600
 But it was, it was baby's hair, right, to mimic elderly hair.

00:53:39.600 --> 00:53:40.600
 So he was asked about it.

00:53:40.600 --> 00:53:42.600
 He said baby's hair is the most expensive you can buy in the world,

00:53:42.600 --> 00:53:44.600
 because it's very fine and very thin.

00:53:44.600 --> 00:53:47.600
 And he was quoted, "No one is killed,"

00:53:47.600 --> 00:53:49.600
 alarming way to start talking about this.

00:53:49.600 --> 00:53:52.600
 That just feels like he's protesting way too much.

00:53:52.600 --> 00:53:53.600
 Way too much.

00:53:53.600 --> 00:53:55.600
 No one is killed.

00:53:55.600 --> 00:53:58.600
 No one over the age of two is killed.

00:53:58.600 --> 00:54:01.600
 A baby grows hair, and sometimes they decide to cut it.

00:54:01.600 --> 00:54:04.600
 But it's so far, and it's for the hairline,

00:54:04.600 --> 00:54:06.600
 because often your hair at your hairline is finer.

00:54:06.600 --> 00:54:07.600
 Wow.

00:54:07.600 --> 00:54:08.600
 But it was so fragile.

00:54:08.600 --> 00:54:10.600
 He had to make a new wig every 10 days.

00:54:10.600 --> 00:54:14.600
 How many children did he have to shave?

00:54:14.600 --> 00:54:16.600
 We've got to wrap up soon.

00:54:16.600 --> 00:54:19.600
 Guys, we've actually gone way further than we ever should have

00:54:19.600 --> 00:54:20.600
 in a live stream.

00:54:20.600 --> 00:54:24.600
 So just more Christmas movie stuff really quickly.

00:54:24.600 --> 00:54:28.600
 The IMDB Top 100 Christmas Movies by rating.

00:54:28.600 --> 00:54:30.600
 It's a wonderful life.

00:54:30.600 --> 00:54:32.600
 How the Grinch Stole Christmas, which I thought was going to be

00:54:32.600 --> 00:54:33.600
 the one that we were talking about,

00:54:33.600 --> 00:54:36.600
 was actually the 1966 one that Anna was talking about.

00:54:36.600 --> 00:54:38.600
 Charlie Brown's Christmas, and then Die Hard,

00:54:38.600 --> 00:54:40.600
 which is the controversial one, right?

00:54:40.600 --> 00:54:41.600
 Because some people think it's Christmas.

00:54:41.600 --> 00:54:42.600
 Some people think it isn't.

00:54:42.600 --> 00:54:43.600
 Yeah.

00:54:43.600 --> 00:54:46.600
 But the villain did write Silent Night, so I think that's probably OK.

00:54:46.600 --> 00:54:47.600
 Exactly.

00:54:47.600 --> 00:54:48.600
 That's why it is.

00:54:48.600 --> 00:54:49.600
 Is that why?

00:54:49.600 --> 00:54:51.600
 So I read an article, a scientific article,

00:54:51.600 --> 00:54:55.600
 by Urs A. Dierke called "Every Stainer Story,

00:54:55.600 --> 00:54:58.600
 the Many Dirty Undershirts of John McClain in Die Hard."

00:54:58.600 --> 00:55:02.600
 He says, "This article explores that 34 undershirts

00:55:02.600 --> 00:55:07.600
 worn by Bruce Willis and his stuntmen in the 1988 action film Die Hard."

00:55:07.600 --> 00:55:08.600
 OK?

00:55:08.600 --> 00:55:10.600
 And they go through all of these things,

00:55:10.600 --> 00:55:14.600
 and they tell you exactly what they mean and all that kind of stuff.

00:55:14.600 --> 00:55:17.600
 So the dirty undershirt, according to Urs A. Dierke,

00:55:17.600 --> 00:55:21.600
 is a symbol for injustice and class in other films,

00:55:21.600 --> 00:55:24.600
 such as a streetcar named Desire and Rocky and Rambo.

00:55:24.600 --> 00:55:27.600
 It's further tied to male sexuality and violence

00:55:27.600 --> 00:55:31.600
 in films such as Bonnie and Clyde, Cruising, and White House Down.

00:55:31.600 --> 00:55:34.600
 And they said that all these different shirts,

00:55:34.600 --> 00:55:37.600
 they were all stained in a slightly different way

00:55:37.600 --> 00:55:40.600
 so that you could know which ones were at all the different parts of the movie.

00:55:40.600 --> 00:55:41.600
 Right.

00:55:41.600 --> 00:55:43.600
 So you had some that are really unstained and some that aren't.

00:55:43.600 --> 00:55:45.600
 And they were all numbered on a rail,

00:55:45.600 --> 00:55:47.600
 and he would like, "Oh, I'm going to have number 12 today."

00:55:47.600 --> 00:55:48.600
 Right?

00:55:48.600 --> 00:55:51.600
 And all the stains were specific to things that had happened.

00:55:51.600 --> 00:55:54.600
 And according to the article, it was a planned design process

00:55:54.600 --> 00:55:57.600
 in which no stain was accidental.

00:55:57.600 --> 00:55:59.600
 That is really cool.

00:55:59.600 --> 00:56:01.600
 And that wasn't written by a crazed journalist.

00:56:01.600 --> 00:56:04.600
 That was written by someone. That's the absolute truth.

00:56:04.600 --> 00:56:06.600
 This is written by an academic, yeah.

00:56:06.600 --> 00:56:08.600
 So, for instance, one of the shirts is in the Smithsonian now.

00:56:08.600 --> 00:56:09.600
 Wow.

00:56:09.600 --> 00:56:10.600
 So that kind of looks at 12.

00:56:10.600 --> 00:56:11.600
 Yeah, he starts off with a nice, clean vest.

00:56:11.600 --> 00:56:13.600
 And by the end, he's absolutely mullet.

00:56:13.600 --> 00:56:15.600
 But you'd never consider that.

00:56:15.600 --> 00:56:17.600
 I assumed there was one shirt. How wrong was I?

00:56:17.600 --> 00:56:18.600
 Really wrong.

00:56:18.600 --> 00:56:23.600
 Okay, that is it. That is all of our facts.

00:56:23.600 --> 00:56:25.600
