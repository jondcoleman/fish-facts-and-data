00:00:00,00:00:04,We run it on QI a few years ago. Yeah. Which was there's no such thing as a fish.
00:00:04,00:00:09,"You have no such thing as a fish. No seriously, it's in the Oxford Dictionary of Underwater Life."
00:00:09,00:00:12,"He says it right there, first paragraph. No such thing as a fish."
00:00:12,00:00:24,"Hello and welcome to another episode of No Such Thing as a Fish, a weekly podcast coming to you"
00:00:24,00:00:28,from the QI offices in Covent Garden. My name is Dan Shriver. I'm sitting here with three other
00:00:28,00:00:34,"elves Andy Murray, Anna Chazinski and James Harkin. And once again, we've gathered around the table"
00:00:34,00:00:38,"with our favorite facts from the last seven days. So here we go in no particular order,"
00:00:38,00:00:46,our favorite things from the last week. Anna. My fact is that rats wearing polyester pants
00:00:46,00:00:54,"can't get directions. What, how did they find this out? So this guy, it was in 1993 and it was"
00:00:54,00:00:59,Dr. Armad Shafiq and he dressed up 75 rats. We just established why he did this first?
00:00:59,00:01:04,"Yeah, he wanted to see if polyester decreases fertility. It's science, Dan. Okay. Yeah."
00:01:04,00:01:10,"So yeah, he split them into five groups, dressed one group up in cotton trousers or pants,"
00:01:10,00:01:14,"dressed another group up in polyester pants, another group up in wool pants, another group up"
00:01:14,00:01:20,"in 50/50, which I think is what most people wear, right? Right. It's like 50% cotton, 50% polyester."
00:01:20,00:01:24,"And yeah, they have to wear these pants continuously for six months and then he shoved them in with"
00:01:24,00:01:31,"a load of women. I mean, female rats. No, maybe that was where he went wrong. I mean, a lot of the women"
00:01:31,00:01:37,"got pregnant. Sorry, yeah, he shoved them in with a load of female rats and he found that the"
00:01:37,00:01:43,ones wearing polyester pants tried to mount the females and their ability to penetrate them
00:01:43,00:01:47,"was significantly reduced. And the idea is synthetic fabrics are bad for you, is that it?"
00:01:47,00:01:52,"Yeah, actually, he said that, but I think that's controversial. A lot of studies say wearing"
00:01:52,00:01:59,"polyester boxes might reduce your sperm count, but how weird. Yeah. But then I read quite a good quote"
00:01:59,00:02:03,"from a doctor saying, ""How come during the 70s and 80s when everyone was wearing tight polyester"
00:02:03,00:02:07,"clothes suddenly the human population didn't decrease rapidly?"" Yeah, there were a lot of"
00:02:07,00:02:12,"advances in other areas as well. We're only working a while, but the only variable was what kind of"
00:02:12,00:02:17,"finds trousers everywhere. Yeah, so anyway, he thinks the reason this happens and the reason that it"
00:02:17,00:02:22,"maybe happens in humans, but the reason that it happens definitely in rats is that it creates"
00:02:22,00:02:27,"kind of a static electricity around, if you're wearing polyester, tight polyester. So you've got"
00:02:27,00:02:33,"electric genitals. You've got electric genitals, yeah. That's a great thing. And the sperm hate that."
00:02:33,00:02:39,"And I found this out in a book called ""Bonk"" by Mary Roach, who we love because she writes excellent"
00:02:39,00:02:44,"books. So ""Bonk"" is a scientific approach to sex, but it's really well written. It's really entertaining"
00:02:44,00:02:48,"read. I thought when I heard the fact, I read into this guy just very quickly because I wanted to see"
00:02:48,00:02:53,what kind of character he was. And there was a great little thing that Mary Roach had found out that
00:02:53,00:02:59,"he was Nobel Prize nominated. But the thing is she checked up to see if he was Nobel nominated,"
00:02:59,00:03:04,and the rules of Nobel are that they don't reveal who the nominations were until 50 years after
00:03:04,00:03:08,the nomination itself. So you can go around. She's saying put that on your resume. You can go around
00:03:08,00:03:14,saying you're a Nobel Prize nominated person and no one will ever know. But he also performed the
00:03:14,00:03:19,"world's first bladder transplant. He also did the same experiment on dogs, which I find so I think"
00:03:19,00:03:24,he might have just really liked putting pants on animals. He was quite clear in the study that he
00:03:24,00:03:30,washed them every time they were soiled. Rats do soil themselves a lot. They urinate almost all the time.
00:03:30,00:03:34,"Oh, that's a lot of washing, man. Yeah. Unless it was just number two's that he was cleaning up."
00:03:35,00:03:42,"But so rats urinate all the time everywhere to attract women, female rats. They also"
00:03:42,00:03:47,weave on food to marketers edible standard practice. Yeah. Females will weave on a male that they
00:03:47,00:03:52,particularly like male rats will do the same to females. Young rats will weave on older rats.
00:03:52,00:03:57,And no one knows why they do that. And dominant males regularly weave on their subordinates.
00:03:57,00:04:02,"Not standard practice. No, that's a lot of weaving to be cleaning up after. Is that clear?"
00:04:02,00:04:07,"Do they have to constantly drink? Possessently in the pub, just downing pines."
00:04:07,00:04:15,So we don't know why they piss on each other? I think the idea is maybe that it contains
00:04:15,00:04:19,pheromones or something like that. But it seems like such a blunt instrument to us because we don't
00:04:19,00:04:23,"know about whatever pheromones maybe it is. So they probably look at us going, all these humans,"
00:04:23,00:04:27,"they make noises with their mouths, when they're happy, when they're sad, to please people, to make"
00:04:27,00:04:33,"people angry. It's grotesque. Why are they marking that you're lying, there was edible."
00:04:33,00:04:41,"Going back to Mary Roach, which is where you got the fact about rats in Pants from. I read it a"
00:04:41,00:04:45,"few years ago, I think it was in the J series and because you have to tenuously tie everything"
00:04:45,00:04:48,"to the letter of the alphabet you're studying. Mine was at a J for jiggy, brackets, jiggy."
00:04:48,00:04:56,"Other incredible facts from this book, Bonk, I love this one. In 1851 a gynecologist called James"
00:04:56,00:05:00,Platt White was expelled from the American Medical Association from inviting medical students to
00:05:00,00:05:04,observe a consenting woman giving birth because his colleagues were so outraged by the idea of a
00:05:04,00:05:08,male doctor looking at female genitals. I was given birth to in front of a bunch of students.
00:05:08,00:05:13,"Why? Really? Yeah. It was pretty awesome. Can you remember much about it? Of course, of course I can,"
00:05:13,00:05:20,"we are. It's not a talk about how beautiful I was. Oh, and the other two fifths of the human penis"
00:05:20,00:05:25,"is hidden beneath the skin. Two fifths. Two fifths? It's like an iceberg. Oh, and I think the other"
00:05:25,00:05:28,thing I should have mentioned on this podcast before is about the postage stamp penis test.
00:05:28,00:05:33,"Well, say it anyway, what is it? In the 20th century, if someone couldn't get an erection,"
00:05:33,00:05:37,it was either going to be psychological or it was going to be physiological. So to test whether or not
00:05:37,00:05:41,"it was purely bodily problem or whether it was all in the mind, they would attach a strip of"
00:05:41,00:05:46,perforated postage stamps around the base of the penis and then leave you overnight. If it was a
00:05:46,00:05:49,"purely psychological problem, you would have an erection as you slept and the perforations would"
00:05:49,00:05:54,"tear, whereas if it was a physiological problem, you wouldn't and you'd wake up still. Well, the thing"
00:05:54,00:06:05,"was when you woke up and your penis had been sent to basketball. Okay, time for back number two,"
00:06:05,00:06:09,"Andrew Hunter Murray. Okay, my effect is that during the First World War,"
00:06:09,00:06:16,"entertainment for the troops included organised pillow fights, wheelbarrow races and wrestling on"
00:06:16,00:06:21,"the backs of mules. Sounds like fun. It does sound like fun. Wrestling on top of a mule,"
00:06:21,00:06:25,"like two men on a top of a mule. What I think it is, is two men on two different mules"
00:06:25,00:06:29,"trying to push the other one off. Like low key jasting, but I haven't confirmed that,"
00:06:29,00:06:35,"so you may be right. It may be, it may be two men on one mule. So that's a lot to put on one mule."
00:06:35,00:06:40,Yeah. I do know you're not allowed legally to ride a llama. What do you mean? Nobody's allowed to
00:06:40,00:06:45,"ride a llama. It's just in this country or? Well, again, you test the limits of my knowledge."
00:06:45,00:06:48,"Should we have llamas in Britain? We do have llamas in Britain. They're farmed quite a lot,"
00:06:48,00:06:53,"but it's really bad for them to ride them. So they have quite weak backs, and you could load them"
00:06:53,00:06:57,"up with a bit of weight, but really not very much. And when you look at them, they've got these lovely"
00:06:57,00:07:01,vertical high necks and then quite a dip in their backs. You can easily see that riding them
00:07:01,00:07:06,"would be quite bad for them, actually. Their audience ride them everywhere. They didn't care."
00:07:06,00:07:11,"Anyway, yes, so these were just the various things that were done to keep morale up"
00:07:11,00:07:14,"among British troops, because obviously there's a lot of time going on between battles."
00:07:14,00:07:18,"So where did these fights take place? So they in the front line, do we think? Just front trench?"
00:07:18,00:07:22,"I just spec'd a little bit further. Yeah, they probably didn't do wheelbarrow races in no"
00:07:22,00:07:27,"man's land. Did they? No. Just going over the top with your pillows. So, I'm sorry, just so yeah,"
00:07:27,00:07:31,"just this this pillow fight that we only know about it, because these are first one more diaries,"
00:07:31,00:07:35,which the National Archive have been digitising. And you can go and see them at Q and you can go and
00:07:35,00:07:39,look through them. They have hundreds of thousands of documents. They have a copy of the Doomsday
00:07:39,00:07:46,"book there. A replica of it, but nonetheless, it's very cool. Wow. Yeah, very good. Hey, so pillows"
00:07:46,00:07:52,"used to be made of stone. How long would you like to fight with those, would you? No. When was this?"
00:07:52,00:07:56,"In the 70s. These are thousands of years old. So the very earliest pillows are Mesopotamian,"
00:07:56,00:08:02,"they're about 9,000 years old. And they're made of stone and they're carved in a half moon shape,"
00:08:02,00:08:05,so they can support your neck. Some people think that it was just to stop insects crawling into your
00:08:05,00:08:09,"nose and mouth as you slept. Okay. On the day he died, Martin Luther King had a pillow fight,"
00:08:09,00:08:13,few years before he died. It's recorded in Andrew Young's biography. Andrew Young was a really good
00:08:13,00:08:20,"friend of his and the three of them were in the Memphis Lorraine Hotel. And, yeah, apparently,"
00:08:20,00:08:24,Martin Luther King and another friend set up on this other guy with pillows and beat him about. That's
00:08:24,00:08:29,"a pillow assault. Yeah, it was pillow assault. Yeah, it was pillow abuse. Japan actually has issued"
00:08:29,00:08:34,"an official pillow for pillow fighting. Oh, they're really into each panel. Yeah, there's an annual"
00:08:34,00:08:41,"pillow fight day in Japan. And, you know, if a pillow has a zip, if a pillow has feathers that you"
00:08:41,00:08:44,"could choke on. Made out of stone. Made out of stone. You died, mate. You know, there's a lot of,"
00:08:44,00:08:50,there's a lot of pain that can be brought on by a pillow. And the safest pillow you can use for
00:08:50,00:08:53,"a pillow fight. What does that know? Yeah, you've seen them. It's got many feathers. Yeah,"
00:08:53,00:08:58,what feathers? We're not allowed to feathers anymore in a pillow fight. If feathers come out and
00:08:58,00:09:01,"you choke on a feather, you can die. That's part of the joy of pillow fighting. It's true. Feathers"
00:09:01,00:09:07,everywhere. Peter the Great of Russia used used a young male orderly stomach as a pillow when he
00:09:07,00:09:12,"was traveling. He would fall asleep and he would wake up an hour or two later, completely refreshed,"
00:09:12,00:09:17,"because he sometimes had convulsions, which might have been epileptic convulsions, we're not sure."
00:09:17,00:09:21,"But when it became a proper convulsion, the only cure was to put him in the company of someone he"
00:09:21,00:09:25,"found relaxing. And so when he married his second wife, it was always her or another young woman."
00:09:25,00:09:30,He would just put his head in her lap. She was choking his head. It's like the idea of like him
00:09:30,00:09:38,"going to bed with his wife. So night honey, laying back on a man. At the top of the bed."
00:09:38,00:09:46,I have to sleep on the legs as well. The pillow is too hot. I need to turn it over.
00:09:46,00:09:52,"If we go back to entertainment in the First World War, because I know this is one of your boss's"
00:09:52,00:09:56,"favourite things, Andy. The wipers times, if you guys have ever read the wipers times,"
00:09:56,00:10:02,"which is so good. In his lot, the other boss. He's not John Lloyd. Andy does his moon nighting at"
00:10:02,00:10:06,"private eye. But I think he did a documentary on the wipers times, didn't they? I just find it"
00:10:06,00:10:11,"amazing. So in 1916, in the trenches, the wipers times was the trench newspaper. And it was a"
00:10:11,00:10:16,"theoretical newspaper, really funny, like private eye or the daily mash. And it happened just"
00:10:16,00:10:20,because it was when they were in EEPRA and they just stumbled across a printing press that was
00:10:20,00:10:25,lying around. And then they started distributing this newspaper. It would do things like publish
00:10:25,00:10:31,articles apologising for when the British sheld their own people. And it was pretty subversive when
00:10:31,00:10:35,"you read it. You think, how on earth did they get away with printing and distributing this to"
00:10:35,00:10:39,"normal soldiers? Yeah, it was always so delicious. Given that they had their letters checked and they"
00:10:39,00:10:42,"had to be read all the way through to check they weren't saying anything negative about the war,"
00:10:42,00:10:46,"but they were allowed to publish this newspaper, which is extremely negative about their experiences"
00:10:46,00:10:50,"in the trenches. It's kind of weird. It's amazing. I have one more really, I'm one of my favourite"
00:10:50,00:10:56,facts about the First World War. Okay. They dug a section of trench to help people train for life
00:10:56,00:11:01,in the trenches in Blackpool. But they also took visitors around. You could pay a penny and visit
00:11:01,00:11:05,"them. They were called the loose trenches and be shown around by a soldier who was recuperating,"
00:11:05,00:11:08,who'd been actually at the front in France or Belgium. Imagine spending all that time on the
00:11:08,00:11:14,front line in World War I and then being sent to Blackpool. I'm allowed to say that because I'm from
00:11:14,00:11:23,Lancashire. The record for the largest pillow fight ever engaged in was set in Chicago in 2013 and
00:11:23,00:11:30,"involved 3,813 people, but four and a half thousand pillows, which I think is cheating. So some of you"
00:11:30,00:11:34,"have lied too? Yeah, I guess so. Oh. Didn't know it was allowed. Got to check the old Japanese pillow"
00:11:34,00:11:40,"fighting rules. Just, this is pretty non-secretary, but about world records. I just really like that"
00:11:40,00:11:49,thing about the world record custard pie fight. The record was 253 custard pies thrown in the
00:11:49,00:11:57,"fight. It would have been 255, but two of the pies were mysteriously eaten. That mysterious."
00:11:57,00:12:04,"That's quite small for a custard pie fight. We could beat that. We could beat that in a QI audience,"
00:12:04,00:12:07,couldn't we? Yeah. Don't know how the studio managers are going to feel about that.
00:12:07,00:12:15,"Okay, time to move on to fact number three and that is James."
00:12:15,00:12:22,"Okay, my fact is that the atmosphere on Venus is so hot that if you took a pizza out of a freezer"
00:12:22,00:12:29,that it would cook in three seconds. Wow. And would it cook all the way through? Or would it burn
00:12:29,00:12:34,"on the surface and not cook in the middle? Great question. Yeah. I imagine, yeah, there would be a"
00:12:34,00:12:42,"certain rare quality of the inside. Yeah, and singe on the outside. And this comes from a talk by"
00:12:42,00:12:47,"Neil DeGrasse Tyson and it was about his book, which was Death by Black Hole and other cosmic"
00:12:47,00:12:53,"quandaries. And he says in his book, I think that it would take either seven or nine seconds,"
00:12:53,00:12:58,"but in this article about his talk, someone corrected him and said it would be three seconds."
00:12:58,00:13:01,"Oh, okay. I'd not show what the correction was. I think it might have been to do the pressure"
00:13:01,00:13:06,"or something. I like, I like when scientists come up with these sort of weird analogies. Yeah,"
00:13:06,00:13:12,"that way it is good because someone might say to you, okay, it's 800 degrees Fahrenheit on Venus,"
00:13:12,00:13:16,"but what does that mean to anyone? Yeah, it's just a number, isn't it? Yeah. But also,"
00:13:16,00:13:22,"if it's 800 degrees Fahrenheit on Venus, why are you having pizza? You should have a nice ice cream."
00:13:22,00:13:27,"Maybe a cool lemonade. Boy, yeah. And if you're in a refrigerator as well, stay in the fridge,"
00:13:27,00:13:34,"it's boiling outside. How are you powering this fridge? Okay, there are certain, certain administrative"
00:13:34,00:13:40,"problems there, but nonetheless, that's what would happen. In fact, fridges in the Arctic,"
00:13:40,00:13:45,"the Chukchi, I think, do this and probably in Canada, they do it as well. They use refrigerators"
00:13:45,00:13:51,"to keep things warm because if you have food outside, it'll freeze, but if you put it in the refrigerator"
00:13:51,00:13:55,"where it's like three degrees, it'll keep it stopped for fridges. Do they call the fridge the oven?"
00:13:56,00:14:03,No. I'm speaking of weather on planets. Do you guys know about planet H-D-1-8-9-7-3-3-B? Of course.
00:14:03,00:14:12,"So this is a planet that is 63 light years away from us and it rains glass sideways in 7,000 kilometers"
00:14:12,00:14:18,"per hour wind on this planet. Wow. I want light to play golf in that. Do you know, I actually tweeted"
00:14:18,00:14:22,"this a few days ago and I think someone responded with that exact answer. Yeah, it sounds like a cool"
00:14:22,00:14:27,"place. So it's got this deep blue hue, which they've worked out as a result of it's molten glass,"
00:14:27,00:14:33,"so it's silicate in the atmosphere, which is shooting down sideways. Wow. Have you guys heard about"
00:14:33,00:14:40,"the mysterious light? Oh, Venus. No, Daniel, we haven't heard about your mysterious light."
00:14:40,00:14:45,"The ash in light, it's called. It's a light that happens on the planet that scientists have been"
00:14:45,00:14:49,studying. Have no idea what it is. There's a lot of theories. No one's decided what it is yet.
00:14:49,00:14:54,Herschel saw it. Patrick Moore was a kind of called Franz von Gruthlisson. I can't pronounce his name
00:14:54,00:15:00,"probably, but he believed that it was fires from a celebration of a new vanusian emperor being announced."
00:15:00,00:15:03,All these scientists have been looking at it over the years and we still don't know what it is. So
00:15:03,00:15:07,it's a mystery and they could be lightning. It's just a patch of light that just comes up and I have
00:15:07,00:15:12,"no idea what it is. For a long time, they did think that could be life on Venus because it's so"
00:15:12,00:15:17,"covered in clouds, it was really difficult to see, but with telescopes, what was going on under"
00:15:17,00:15:22,there? So it was only when they sent probes down that they realized actually there was no way anything
00:15:22,00:15:27,"could possibly live down here. When the Soviet and the nearer program sent probes down there,"
00:15:27,00:15:32,the longest any of the probes lasted was 127 minutes before they melted.
00:15:32,00:15:38,Really? The surface of Venus is hot enough to melt an aluminium pan. So I don't know what you're
00:15:38,00:15:46,"serving this pizza wrong. Hey, you want to hear some stuff about pizza? Yeah, yeah, yeah, go on."
00:15:46,00:15:50,This was a publicity stunt by Pizza Hut in the early 2000s. They claimed that they were the first
00:15:50,00:15:57,company in the world to deliver a pizza to outer space because the company sent one on a Russian
00:15:57,00:16:02,"rocket to the International Space Station and then Yuri Usichov, one of the Russian cosmonauts,"
00:16:02,00:16:07,"living there, ate it and Pizza Hut paid about 700,000 quid for that. So I think we can all agree,"
00:16:07,00:16:11,money was spent. It is now that they've got this kind of promotion from the QI podcast.
00:16:11,00:16:16,"Before they were wondering if anything had happened to it. Yeah, but they paid all this money."
00:16:16,00:16:22,"And in return, they got to do that. Then they got footage of Mr Usichov flashing a thumbs up after"
00:16:22,00:16:28,eating the pizza and then for pasting the chain's logo on a rocket last year. You do you guys know
00:16:28,00:16:35,"about Pizza Hut's proposal package? No. So this cot... Sounds romantic. It is romantic, cost $10,000 and"
00:16:35,00:16:42,"$10.00. It was a limited edition offer in 2012 and it came with a red ruby ring, a limousine which"
00:16:42,00:16:48,"took you to your location of choice, flowers, fireworks, a photographer and the cherry on the icing,"
00:16:48,00:16:52,a $10 dinner box. What's a $10 dinner box? It's like a box with pizza in it and some cheese sticks.
00:16:52,00:16:59,Another thing the Pizza Hut has is its own perfume called ode to Pizza Hut. It smells apparently
00:16:59,00:17:04,"like a freshly opened box of pizza, although a professional smellologist, whatever we're calling them,"
00:17:04,00:17:10,"actually said it smells like cinnamon, baby powder and most overwhelmingly feet. They're not my favorite"
00:17:10,00:17:15,"toppings. Actually, speaking of William Marry Me, this is something I looked into for the last"
00:17:15,00:17:21,fact we were discussing for the Iceland fact. But the first woman who ever placed a personal ad
00:17:21,00:17:27,"in a newspaper was immediately committed to an asylum. What did it say? Did it say blah, blah, blah?"
00:17:27,00:17:33,"I'm going to kill everyone, Marry Me. No, she was just committed to doing asylum by the"
00:17:33,00:17:39,meds. She placed a personal ad in the Manchester weekly journal in 1727. She was called Helen Morrison
00:17:39,00:17:43,and the first person to respond was the mayor who had a locked up in an asylum for a month for doing
00:17:43,00:17:49,something so completeness. I don't believe that. When was the last time you were in Manchester?
00:17:49,00:17:57,"I don't mean much. A few things about weather. Okay. On planets, the great dark spot on Neptune has"
00:17:57,00:18:04,"winds of 1,500 miles per hour. If there winds anywhere on Earth, for instance, are more than"
00:18:04,00:18:10,"about 120 miles an hour, it's no longer possible to stay upright and it's 1,500 miles an hour there,"
00:18:10,00:18:15,"so 10 times more. So you're telling us if you opened an umbrella, you would fly. You would fly."
00:18:15,00:18:21,"Well, you would certainly be throwing along the floor if not fly. Awesome. Also on Mars, the"
00:18:21,00:18:28,"atmosphere is so thin on Mars that if you stood at the equator at noon, it would feel like summer"
00:18:28,00:18:36,"at your feet and winter at your head. Wow. Wow. So crouched to eat your pizza, stand up to eat your"
00:18:36,00:18:42,"ice cream dessert. The beautiful clouds floating around your midwreff. Yeah, it's very thin, so you"
00:18:42,00:18:47,wouldn't really see much of it. Would it be like being a giant on Earth? Yeah. Maybe. I'm just trying
00:18:47,00:18:52,"to get a clear sense of what it would look like to be there. I was looking at weird ways to cook stuff,"
00:18:52,00:18:57,"okay? Because, you know, pizza on Venus, a weird way to cook stuff, tips for other weird ways to cook"
00:18:57,00:19:01,"stuff. If your oven's broken, poaching salmon in the dishwasher, apparently what actually works,"
00:19:01,00:19:06,"have you, does it work? Yeah. Yeah. It's great. Rapid and tin foil. Yeah. A cook on top of your car"
00:19:06,00:19:09,"engine, you've got a drive for about an hour in your car for something to cook properly like an egg,"
00:19:09,00:19:13,but the other good way to cook something when your oven's broken is to put it in the middle of
00:19:13,00:19:19,"a compost heap. And so there's a guy who likes to do this, I was reading his blog and it gets really"
00:19:19,00:19:24,"hot in the middle of compost heaps. So in fact, once our compost heap and our garden set on fire,"
00:19:24,00:19:30,"it was mental and our garden, but also composty. Yeah, so maybe you know, wrap it in foil again,"
00:19:30,00:19:36,"but this guy says, I quote, now whenever I hanker for a real breakfast treat, I drop a few eggs in"
00:19:36,00:19:42,the compost heap in the evening and look forward to a morning feast. Be sure when he says drop a few eggs.
00:19:42,00:19:54,"Okay, time for the final fact of the show. And that is my fact. And my fact this week is that in Iceland,"
00:19:54,00:19:58,there is a phone app that tells you if you're related to the person that you're hitting on.
00:19:58,00:20:02,"Okay, I don't usually go to frozen food supermarkets to hit some people, but maybe you do."
00:20:02,00:20:06,"Okay, the country, Iceland, they've got a really small population over there."
00:20:06,00:20:12,"Some like 320,000 people, so many people were accidentally finding out, you know, in the bedroom chat in"
00:20:12,00:20:17,"the morning. So like, oh, so what do you want today? Oh, go to my, my mom's, my mom's barbecue."
00:20:17,00:20:21,"Oh, I'm going to a barbecue today. Oh, what's up? Oh, my God. Cousin too."
00:20:21,00:20:25,"Yeah, that's that's how it works. My grandmother's birthday today. Oh, me too, too."
00:20:25,00:20:34,"Yeah, so where do you live? Just in the next bedroom, actually. Yeah, so this is this is a really"
00:20:34,00:20:38,important app because they want to stop the gene pool from becoming incestuous. And it's basically
00:20:38,00:20:42,"in a bar, you both have the app on your phones, you bump the phones, their motto is bump phones before"
00:20:42,00:20:47,you bump in the bed. And the idea is that then tells you whether or not you're related. It's very
00:20:47,00:20:52,"clever. That's great. Isn't the feature, the specific feature in this app is called, I'm going to"
00:20:52,00:20:59,"mispronounce this, sif yasperspilia, which is called the incest spoiler. Yeah, it's got negative"
00:20:59,00:21:03,connotations. It implies you're ruining something that could have been otherwise a bit of an experience.
00:21:03,00:21:10,Sounds like you wanted incest incest spoiler alert. It's what you would receive with your phone.
00:21:10,00:21:17,"Incest spoiler alert. Yeah. That's so good. But yeah, I just think that's what I really love most about"
00:21:17,00:21:22,it other than like it's it's a very interesting app. Is the fact that apps are getting to the point
00:21:22,00:21:28,"now where we've just got so many options of lifestyle choices via reading a little app that we,"
00:21:28,00:21:34,"you know, my friend knew that she was giving birth because her pregnancy contraction app told her,"
00:21:34,00:21:41,"I mean, yeah, I don't know how that works. There also in Japan at the moment, there's a new app,"
00:21:41,00:21:48,"which, okay, basically, this sounds really weird, but there's a bra now in Japan that doesn't come off"
00:21:48,00:21:53,unless you truly love the person that you're talking to or that you're having relationships.
00:21:53,00:21:59,You're kind of like a chastity bra and the way that it knows that you do like the person is something in
00:21:59,00:22:05,"the bra that monitors your pulsating heart, your heart then sends a message to your iPhone where there"
00:22:05,00:22:11,is an app that releases the bra and then it can come off. What about when you go go to sleep at the end
00:22:11,00:22:17,of the day and you want to take a bra off? You have to feign being in love. And also fast a heart rate.
00:22:17,00:22:22,What if you're being mugged and then your bra comes off? Those photographs son rollercoasters will be
00:22:22,00:22:30,"really interesting. Everyone's bra, so I don't know. It wasn't scared. That's not what you're pressed to say."
00:22:30,00:22:40,There was an app in Azerbaijan in 2013 that would tell you the results of the election as soon as the
00:22:40,00:22:46,"results came in. Unfortunately, anyone who downloaded it got a message the day before the polls opened"
00:22:46,00:22:54,saying there was a massive landslide for the current president. There's a really good one I read about
00:22:54,00:23:00,the other day called Run P and it's an app and the idea behind it is so you know when you're in the
00:23:00,00:23:04,cinema and you're watching a movie and you really need the toilet but it's a great movie and you're
00:23:04,00:23:09,going I have no idea when I need to go. So the app is you open it up and you type in the name of the
00:23:09,00:23:13,movie that you're watching and people have watched the movie before have put this into the app. So if
00:23:13,00:23:18,you're watching Guardians of the Galaxy it will say one hour 28 minutes in you're going to get to a scene
00:23:18,00:23:22,that says that's like this. Perfect time to go. It's a boring scene. It's not needed to know the rest of
00:23:22,00:23:27,the plot. So it tells you exactly in every movie where you need to go for a P. That's good. That's so
00:23:27,00:23:36,"good. It's really great. Wow. Okay, incest. Should we talk about incest? Yes, please. So in Hawaii they"
00:23:36,00:23:45,used to revere incest and they had a system called Nia Upo-Oh whose aim was to keep the royal lineage
00:23:45,00:23:50,as clear as possible and the very top of the society was a Kapu and that was a product of a royal
00:23:50,00:23:55,brother and sister and if you were the son or daughter of a royal brother or sister you were
00:23:55,00:24:04,"considered a god. Partly because you had seven legs and we're blue. Yeah. Wow, weird. Yeah. So in"
00:24:04,00:24:09,"Russia, China, Ivory Coast, Spain, Portugal and quite a few other places it's not illegal to commit"
00:24:09,00:24:16,incest but in Korea it's really illegal and actually you can't not allow to marry anyone who's
00:24:16,00:24:23,related more closely than 8th cousin. Oh my god. Yeah. Although obviously it's difficult to check that.
00:24:23,00:24:29,You're not allowed to knowingly do that but you by law I think you have to check that they're not
00:24:29,00:24:34,second cousins. In South Korea you're not it was decreed in 3008 that if you had the same surname as
00:24:34,00:24:39,someone else you couldn't marry them because of this incest. However a fifth of people in South
00:24:39,00:24:43,Korea have the surname Kim so there are all these people who might love each other very much and be
00:24:43,00:24:48,very distantly not related at all essentially but legally they weren't allowed to marry. So I think
00:24:48,00:24:52,"they've changed it now. Have they a little bit? Yeah, they have. In 1997 it was repealed but before"
00:24:52,00:24:57,that every so often they would just have an amnesty and say okay a few ten thousand of you can get
00:24:57,00:25:01,married to each other. Interesting. Yeah that's very interesting. Yeah it is. I was going to talk about
00:25:01,00:25:05,Iceland. Does anyone interested in Iceland? I love Iceland. Have you been to Iceland?
00:25:05,00:25:12,Yes I have. I always think Iceland is like a geography teacher's best ever thing because it's got
00:25:12,00:25:16,everything like what it is. Oh my god it's worth flakes and you know tectonic plates and everything
00:25:16,00:25:22,that geezers. Yeah. They also believe in elves which is very exciting. Oh yeah. 54% I think it's
00:25:22,00:25:29,in 1998. Well yeah I remember because I only know this because John Lloyd told me this years ago he
00:25:29,00:25:36,said that 54% believe in it but if you get them drunk something like 90% admit that they actually
00:25:36,00:25:41,believe in it. I'm so really like that's great. There was quite a good comment from an Icelandic
00:25:41,00:25:45,academic who was saying you say that it's geographically fascinating who was saying you can completely
00:25:45,00:25:50,believe if you've lived there and grown up there the earth is so volatile and moving all the time and
00:25:50,00:25:54,whips the smoke shooting up out of the ground and stuff it's kind of not surprising that people think
00:25:54,00:25:59,there are spirits everywhere and there's a really sweet story of a politician an Icelandic politician
00:25:59,00:26:06,a couple of years ago his cast ban off the road and he said that he was saved from any injury by elves
00:26:06,00:26:11,and then a short while later they were going to build over the elf home and the elves lived in a nearby
00:26:11,00:26:15,boulder and so the politician said no you can't do that and said we'll have to move the boulder
00:26:15,00:26:19,that the elves live in so they got someone who speaks to elves to talk to the elves who are
00:26:19,00:26:23,invisible to most people and they said okay you can move our boulder but we really need to have a
00:26:23,00:26:27,view of the sea and it's got to be on grass because we like to keep sheep also invisible sheep
00:26:27,00:26:33,south facing garden yeah and they did invisible tiny elf size sheep uh that you know elves are
00:26:33,00:26:38,human sizes Icelandic elves are they yeah oh I see people but they're invisible way they look like
00:26:38,00:26:44,people but they're invisible that is the only difference the car I didn't know they were I didn't
00:26:44,00:26:48,know they were man sizes it were um should we move on I was just going to say quickly uh because I
00:26:48,00:26:51,think I think I must be one of James's favorite museums or whichever one of you loves weird museums
00:26:51,00:26:55,Iceland has the phallological museum and that has as well which is the penis museum
00:26:55,00:27:00,penis museum say the real sorry sorry I'm like I would mention penis is too much I felt like we
00:27:00,00:27:06,should use a different word two thirds of its underground well you say that but parts of it are
00:27:06,00:27:11,invisible because it claims to have um penises as well as penises is lots of animals it claims to
00:27:11,00:27:16,have elf penises oh and the elf penises look like human penises yeah but they're invisible
00:27:16,00:27:21,so it's just a huge empty cabinet it's I've brought in my collection of elf penises I'm really
00:27:21,00:27:25,disappointed that none of you have used it I'm actually on the wall I'm actually wearing my elf
00:27:25,00:27:31,dick coat right now it's just a coat of penises but you can't I wish you could see it
00:27:33,00:27:46,anyway have you had your mouth open this whole podcast okay that's it that's all our facts thanks
