WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.480
 We run it on QI a few years ago. Yeah. Which was there's no such thing as a fish.

00:00:04.480 --> 00:00:09.520
 You have no such thing as a fish. No seriously, it's in the Oxford Dictionary of Underwater Life.

00:00:09.520 --> 00:00:12.480
 He says it right there, first paragraph. No such thing as a fish.

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:24.400
 Hello and welcome to another episode of No Such Thing as a Fish, a weekly podcast coming to you

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:28.720
 from the QI offices in Covent Garden. My name is Dan Shriver. I'm sitting here with three other

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:34.080
 elves Andy Murray, Anna Chazinski and James Harkin. And once again, we've gathered around the table

00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:38.240
 with our favorite facts from the last seven days. So here we go in no particular order,

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:46.960
 our favorite things from the last week. Anna. My fact is that rats wearing polyester pants

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:54.080
 can't get directions. What, how did they find this out? So this guy, it was in 1993 and it was

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:59.920
 Dr. Armad Shafiq and he dressed up 75 rats. We just established why he did this first?

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:04.720
 Yeah, he wanted to see if polyester decreases fertility. It's science, Dan. Okay. Yeah.

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:10.720
 So yeah, he split them into five groups, dressed one group up in cotton trousers or pants,

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:14.560
 dressed another group up in polyester pants, another group up in wool pants, another group up

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:20.160
 in 50/50, which I think is what most people wear, right? Right. It's like 50% cotton, 50% polyester.

00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:24.320
 And yeah, they have to wear these pants continuously for six months and then he shoved them in with

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:31.040
 a load of women. I mean, female rats. No, maybe that was where he went wrong. I mean, a lot of the women

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:37.200
 got pregnant. Sorry, yeah, he shoved them in with a load of female rats and he found that the

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:43.520
 ones wearing polyester pants tried to mount the females and their ability to penetrate them

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:47.840
 was significantly reduced. And the idea is synthetic fabrics are bad for you, is that it?

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:52.480
 Yeah, actually, he said that, but I think that's controversial. A lot of studies say wearing

00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:59.120
 polyester boxes might reduce your sperm count, but how weird. Yeah. But then I read quite a good quote

00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:03.280
 from a doctor saying, "How come during the 70s and 80s when everyone was wearing tight polyester

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:07.840
 clothes suddenly the human population didn't decrease rapidly?" Yeah, there were a lot of

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:12.800
 advances in other areas as well. We're only working a while, but the only variable was what kind of

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:17.680
 finds trousers everywhere. Yeah, so anyway, he thinks the reason this happens and the reason that it

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:22.560
 maybe happens in humans, but the reason that it happens definitely in rats is that it creates

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:27.120
 kind of a static electricity around, if you're wearing polyester, tight polyester. So you've got

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:33.680
 electric genitals. You've got electric genitals, yeah. That's a great thing. And the sperm hate that.

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:39.360
 And I found this out in a book called "Bonk" by Mary Roach, who we love because she writes excellent

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:44.400
 books. So "Bonk" is a scientific approach to sex, but it's really well written. It's really entertaining

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:48.640
 read. I thought when I heard the fact, I read into this guy just very quickly because I wanted to see

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:53.600
 what kind of character he was. And there was a great little thing that Mary Roach had found out that

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:59.760
 he was Nobel Prize nominated. But the thing is she checked up to see if he was Nobel nominated,

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:04.640
 and the rules of Nobel are that they don't reveal who the nominations were until 50 years after

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:08.560
 the nomination itself. So you can go around. She's saying put that on your resume. You can go around

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:14.320
 saying you're a Nobel Prize nominated person and no one will ever know. But he also performed the

00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:19.760
 world's first bladder transplant. He also did the same experiment on dogs, which I find so I think

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:24.240
 he might have just really liked putting pants on animals. He was quite clear in the study that he

00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:30.080
 washed them every time they were soiled. Rats do soil themselves a lot. They urinate almost all the time.

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:34.800
 Oh, that's a lot of washing, man. Yeah. Unless it was just number two's that he was cleaning up.

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:42.080
 But so rats urinate all the time everywhere to attract women, female rats. They also

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:47.600
 weave on food to marketers edible standard practice. Yeah. Females will weave on a male that they

00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:52.880
 particularly like male rats will do the same to females. Young rats will weave on older rats.

00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:57.520
 And no one knows why they do that. And dominant males regularly weave on their subordinates.

00:03:57.520 --> 00:04:02.720
 Not standard practice. No, that's a lot of weaving to be cleaning up after. Is that clear?

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:07.360
 Do they have to constantly drink? Possessently in the pub, just downing pines.

00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:15.200
 So we don't know why they piss on each other? I think the idea is maybe that it contains

00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:19.920
 pheromones or something like that. But it seems like such a blunt instrument to us because we don't

00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:23.200
 know about whatever pheromones maybe it is. So they probably look at us going, all these humans,

00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:27.360
 they make noises with their mouths, when they're happy, when they're sad, to please people, to make

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:33.840
 people angry. It's grotesque. Why are they marking that you're lying, there was edible.

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:41.120
 Going back to Mary Roach, which is where you got the fact about rats in Pants from. I read it a

00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:45.200
 few years ago, I think it was in the J series and because you have to tenuously tie everything

00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:48.720
 to the letter of the alphabet you're studying. Mine was at a J for jiggy, brackets, jiggy.

00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:56.000
 Other incredible facts from this book, Bonk, I love this one. In 1851 a gynecologist called James

00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:00.160
 Platt White was expelled from the American Medical Association from inviting medical students to

00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:04.480
 observe a consenting woman giving birth because his colleagues were so outraged by the idea of a

00:05:04.480 --> 00:05:08.800
 male doctor looking at female genitals. I was given birth to in front of a bunch of students.

00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:13.360
 Why? Really? Yeah. It was pretty awesome. Can you remember much about it? Of course, of course I can,

00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:20.000
 we are. It's not a talk about how beautiful I was. Oh, and the other two fifths of the human penis

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:25.040
 is hidden beneath the skin. Two fifths. Two fifths? It's like an iceberg. Oh, and I think the other

00:05:25.040 --> 00:05:28.960
 thing I should have mentioned on this podcast before is about the postage stamp penis test.

00:05:28.960 --> 00:05:33.360
 Well, say it anyway, what is it? In the 20th century, if someone couldn't get an erection,

00:05:33.360 --> 00:05:37.440
 it was either going to be psychological or it was going to be physiological. So to test whether or not

00:05:37.440 --> 00:05:41.920
 it was purely bodily problem or whether it was all in the mind, they would attach a strip of

00:05:41.920 --> 00:05:46.560
 perforated postage stamps around the base of the penis and then leave you overnight. If it was a

00:05:46.560 --> 00:05:49.920
 purely psychological problem, you would have an erection as you slept and the perforations would

00:05:49.920 --> 00:05:54.960
 tear, whereas if it was a physiological problem, you wouldn't and you'd wake up still. Well, the thing

00:05:54.960 --> 00:06:05.680
 was when you woke up and your penis had been sent to basketball. Okay, time for back number two,

00:06:05.680 --> 00:06:09.680
 Andrew Hunter Murray. Okay, my effect is that during the First World War,

00:06:09.680 --> 00:06:16.720
 entertainment for the troops included organised pillow fights, wheelbarrow races and wrestling on

00:06:16.720 --> 00:06:21.040
 the backs of mules. Sounds like fun. It does sound like fun. Wrestling on top of a mule,

00:06:21.040 --> 00:06:25.600
 like two men on a top of a mule. What I think it is, is two men on two different mules

00:06:25.600 --> 00:06:29.280
 trying to push the other one off. Like low key jasting, but I haven't confirmed that,

00:06:29.280 --> 00:06:35.040
 so you may be right. It may be, it may be two men on one mule. So that's a lot to put on one mule.

00:06:35.040 --> 00:06:40.080
 Yeah. I do know you're not allowed legally to ride a llama. What do you mean? Nobody's allowed to

00:06:40.080 --> 00:06:45.600
 ride a llama. It's just in this country or? Well, again, you test the limits of my knowledge.

00:06:45.600 --> 00:06:48.720
 Should we have llamas in Britain? We do have llamas in Britain. They're farmed quite a lot,

00:06:48.720 --> 00:06:53.920
 but it's really bad for them to ride them. So they have quite weak backs, and you could load them

00:06:53.920 --> 00:06:57.520
 up with a bit of weight, but really not very much. And when you look at them, they've got these lovely

00:06:57.520 --> 00:07:01.760
 vertical high necks and then quite a dip in their backs. You can easily see that riding them

00:07:01.760 --> 00:07:06.160
 would be quite bad for them, actually. Their audience ride them everywhere. They didn't care.

00:07:06.160 --> 00:07:11.200
 Anyway, yes, so these were just the various things that were done to keep morale up

00:07:11.200 --> 00:07:14.720
 among British troops, because obviously there's a lot of time going on between battles.

00:07:14.720 --> 00:07:18.880
 So where did these fights take place? So they in the front line, do we think? Just front trench?

00:07:18.880 --> 00:07:22.560
 I just spec'd a little bit further. Yeah, they probably didn't do wheelbarrow races in no

00:07:22.560 --> 00:07:27.600
 man's land. Did they? No. Just going over the top with your pillows. So, I'm sorry, just so yeah,

00:07:27.600 --> 00:07:31.520
 just this this pillow fight that we only know about it, because these are first one more diaries,

00:07:31.520 --> 00:07:35.520
 which the National Archive have been digitising. And you can go and see them at Q and you can go and

00:07:35.520 --> 00:07:39.440
 look through them. They have hundreds of thousands of documents. They have a copy of the Doomsday

00:07:39.440 --> 00:07:46.160
 book there. A replica of it, but nonetheless, it's very cool. Wow. Yeah, very good. Hey, so pillows

00:07:46.160 --> 00:07:52.080
 used to be made of stone. How long would you like to fight with those, would you? No. When was this?

00:07:52.080 --> 00:07:56.960
 In the 70s. These are thousands of years old. So the very earliest pillows are Mesopotamian,

00:07:56.960 --> 00:08:02.000
 they're about 9,000 years old. And they're made of stone and they're carved in a half moon shape,

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:05.680
 so they can support your neck. Some people think that it was just to stop insects crawling into your

00:08:05.680 --> 00:08:09.840
 nose and mouth as you slept. Okay. On the day he died, Martin Luther King had a pillow fight,

00:08:09.840 --> 00:08:13.760
 few years before he died. It's recorded in Andrew Young's biography. Andrew Young was a really good

00:08:13.760 --> 00:08:20.000
 friend of his and the three of them were in the Memphis Lorraine Hotel. And, yeah, apparently,

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:24.160
 Martin Luther King and another friend set up on this other guy with pillows and beat him about. That's

00:08:24.160 --> 00:08:29.760
 a pillow assault. Yeah, it was pillow assault. Yeah, it was pillow abuse. Japan actually has issued

00:08:29.760 --> 00:08:34.240
 an official pillow for pillow fighting. Oh, they're really into each panel. Yeah, there's an annual

00:08:34.240 --> 00:08:41.200
 pillow fight day in Japan. And, you know, if a pillow has a zip, if a pillow has feathers that you

00:08:41.200 --> 00:08:44.960
 could choke on. Made out of stone. Made out of stone. You died, mate. You know, there's a lot of,

00:08:44.960 --> 00:08:50.000
 there's a lot of pain that can be brought on by a pillow. And the safest pillow you can use for

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:53.200
 a pillow fight. What does that know? Yeah, you've seen them. It's got many feathers. Yeah,

00:08:53.200 --> 00:08:58.240
 what feathers? We're not allowed to feathers anymore in a pillow fight. If feathers come out and

00:08:58.240 --> 00:09:01.760
 you choke on a feather, you can die. That's part of the joy of pillow fighting. It's true. Feathers

00:09:01.760 --> 00:09:07.040
 everywhere. Peter the Great of Russia used used a young male orderly stomach as a pillow when he

00:09:07.040 --> 00:09:12.880
 was traveling. He would fall asleep and he would wake up an hour or two later, completely refreshed,

00:09:12.880 --> 00:09:17.440
 because he sometimes had convulsions, which might have been epileptic convulsions, we're not sure.

00:09:17.440 --> 00:09:21.600
 But when it became a proper convulsion, the only cure was to put him in the company of someone he

00:09:21.600 --> 00:09:25.920
 found relaxing. And so when he married his second wife, it was always her or another young woman.

00:09:25.920 --> 00:09:30.240
 He would just put his head in her lap. She was choking his head. It's like the idea of like him

00:09:30.240 --> 00:09:38.000
 going to bed with his wife. So night honey, laying back on a man. At the top of the bed.

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:46.160
 I have to sleep on the legs as well. The pillow is too hot. I need to turn it over.

00:09:46.160 --> 00:09:52.080
 If we go back to entertainment in the First World War, because I know this is one of your boss's

00:09:52.080 --> 00:09:56.000
 favourite things, Andy. The wipers times, if you guys have ever read the wipers times,

00:09:56.000 --> 00:10:02.240
 which is so good. In his lot, the other boss. He's not John Lloyd. Andy does his moon nighting at

00:10:02.240 --> 00:10:06.560
 private eye. But I think he did a documentary on the wipers times, didn't they? I just find it

00:10:06.560 --> 00:10:11.120
 amazing. So in 1916, in the trenches, the wipers times was the trench newspaper. And it was a

00:10:11.120 --> 00:10:16.000
 theoretical newspaper, really funny, like private eye or the daily mash. And it happened just

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:20.080
 because it was when they were in EEPRA and they just stumbled across a printing press that was

00:10:20.080 --> 00:10:25.120
 lying around. And then they started distributing this newspaper. It would do things like publish

00:10:25.120 --> 00:10:31.440
 articles apologising for when the British sheld their own people. And it was pretty subversive when

00:10:31.440 --> 00:10:35.840
 you read it. You think, how on earth did they get away with printing and distributing this to

00:10:35.840 --> 00:10:39.840
 normal soldiers? Yeah, it was always so delicious. Given that they had their letters checked and they

00:10:39.840 --> 00:10:42.640
 had to be read all the way through to check they weren't saying anything negative about the war,

00:10:42.640 --> 00:10:46.320
 but they were allowed to publish this newspaper, which is extremely negative about their experiences

00:10:46.320 --> 00:10:50.880
 in the trenches. It's kind of weird. It's amazing. I have one more really, I'm one of my favourite

00:10:50.880 --> 00:10:56.480
 facts about the First World War. Okay. They dug a section of trench to help people train for life

00:10:56.480 --> 00:11:01.280
 in the trenches in Blackpool. But they also took visitors around. You could pay a penny and visit

00:11:01.280 --> 00:11:05.120
 them. They were called the loose trenches and be shown around by a soldier who was recuperating,

00:11:05.120 --> 00:11:08.960
 who'd been actually at the front in France or Belgium. Imagine spending all that time on the

00:11:08.960 --> 00:11:14.960
 front line in World War I and then being sent to Blackpool. I'm allowed to say that because I'm from

00:11:14.960 --> 00:11:23.440
 Lancashire. The record for the largest pillow fight ever engaged in was set in Chicago in 2013 and

00:11:23.440 --> 00:11:30.000
 involved 3,813 people, but four and a half thousand pillows, which I think is cheating. So some of you

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:34.480
 have lied too? Yeah, I guess so. Oh. Didn't know it was allowed. Got to check the old Japanese pillow

00:11:34.480 --> 00:11:40.720
 fighting rules. Just, this is pretty non-secretary, but about world records. I just really like that

00:11:40.720 --> 00:11:49.600
 thing about the world record custard pie fight. The record was 253 custard pies thrown in the

00:11:49.600 --> 00:11:57.280
 fight. It would have been 255, but two of the pies were mysteriously eaten. That mysterious.

00:11:57.280 --> 00:12:04.080
 That's quite small for a custard pie fight. We could beat that. We could beat that in a QI audience,

00:12:04.080 --> 00:12:07.200
 couldn't we? Yeah. Don't know how the studio managers are going to feel about that.

00:12:07.280 --> 00:12:15.360
 Okay, time to move on to fact number three and that is James.

00:12:15.360 --> 00:12:22.960
 Okay, my fact is that the atmosphere on Venus is so hot that if you took a pizza out of a freezer

00:12:22.960 --> 00:12:29.600
 that it would cook in three seconds. Wow. And would it cook all the way through? Or would it burn

00:12:29.600 --> 00:12:34.160
 on the surface and not cook in the middle? Great question. Yeah. I imagine, yeah, there would be a

00:12:34.160 --> 00:12:42.400
 certain rare quality of the inside. Yeah, and singe on the outside. And this comes from a talk by

00:12:42.400 --> 00:12:47.920
 Neil DeGrasse Tyson and it was about his book, which was Death by Black Hole and other cosmic

00:12:47.920 --> 00:12:53.200
 quandaries. And he says in his book, I think that it would take either seven or nine seconds,

00:12:53.200 --> 00:12:58.000
 but in this article about his talk, someone corrected him and said it would be three seconds.

00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:01.840
 Oh, okay. I'd not show what the correction was. I think it might have been to do the pressure

00:13:01.840 --> 00:13:06.960
 or something. I like, I like when scientists come up with these sort of weird analogies. Yeah,

00:13:06.960 --> 00:13:12.480
 that way it is good because someone might say to you, okay, it's 800 degrees Fahrenheit on Venus,

00:13:12.480 --> 00:13:16.320
 but what does that mean to anyone? Yeah, it's just a number, isn't it? Yeah. But also,

00:13:16.320 --> 00:13:22.000
 if it's 800 degrees Fahrenheit on Venus, why are you having pizza? You should have a nice ice cream.

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:27.840
 Maybe a cool lemonade. Boy, yeah. And if you're in a refrigerator as well, stay in the fridge,

00:13:27.840 --> 00:13:34.400
 it's boiling outside. How are you powering this fridge? Okay, there are certain, certain administrative

00:13:34.400 --> 00:13:40.240
 problems there, but nonetheless, that's what would happen. In fact, fridges in the Arctic,

00:13:40.240 --> 00:13:45.920
 the Chukchi, I think, do this and probably in Canada, they do it as well. They use refrigerators

00:13:45.920 --> 00:13:51.360
 to keep things warm because if you have food outside, it'll freeze, but if you put it in the refrigerator

00:13:51.360 --> 00:13:55.680
 where it's like three degrees, it'll keep it stopped for fridges. Do they call the fridge the oven?

00:13:56.080 --> 00:14:03.600
 No. I'm speaking of weather on planets. Do you guys know about planet H-D-1-8-9-7-3-3-B? Of course.

00:14:03.600 --> 00:14:12.640
 So this is a planet that is 63 light years away from us and it rains glass sideways in 7,000 kilometers

00:14:12.640 --> 00:14:18.000
 per hour wind on this planet. Wow. I want light to play golf in that. Do you know, I actually tweeted

00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:22.320
 this a few days ago and I think someone responded with that exact answer. Yeah, it sounds like a cool

00:14:22.320 --> 00:14:27.280
 place. So it's got this deep blue hue, which they've worked out as a result of it's molten glass,

00:14:27.280 --> 00:14:33.920
 so it's silicate in the atmosphere, which is shooting down sideways. Wow. Have you guys heard about

00:14:33.920 --> 00:14:40.560
 the mysterious light? Oh, Venus. No, Daniel, we haven't heard about your mysterious light.

00:14:40.560 --> 00:14:45.280
 The ash in light, it's called. It's a light that happens on the planet that scientists have been

00:14:45.280 --> 00:14:49.600
 studying. Have no idea what it is. There's a lot of theories. No one's decided what it is yet.

00:14:49.600 --> 00:14:54.800
 Herschel saw it. Patrick Moore was a kind of called Franz von Gruthlisson. I can't pronounce his name

00:14:54.800 --> 00:15:00.560
 probably, but he believed that it was fires from a celebration of a new vanusian emperor being announced.

00:15:00.560 --> 00:15:03.680
 All these scientists have been looking at it over the years and we still don't know what it is. So

00:15:03.680 --> 00:15:07.920
 it's a mystery and they could be lightning. It's just a patch of light that just comes up and I have

00:15:07.920 --> 00:15:12.320
 no idea what it is. For a long time, they did think that could be life on Venus because it's so

00:15:12.320 --> 00:15:17.280
 covered in clouds, it was really difficult to see, but with telescopes, what was going on under

00:15:17.280 --> 00:15:22.320
 there? So it was only when they sent probes down that they realized actually there was no way anything

00:15:22.320 --> 00:15:27.520
 could possibly live down here. When the Soviet and the nearer program sent probes down there,

00:15:27.520 --> 00:15:32.720
 the longest any of the probes lasted was 127 minutes before they melted.

00:15:32.720 --> 00:15:38.320
 Really? The surface of Venus is hot enough to melt an aluminium pan. So I don't know what you're

00:15:38.320 --> 00:15:46.160
 serving this pizza wrong. Hey, you want to hear some stuff about pizza? Yeah, yeah, yeah, go on.

00:15:46.160 --> 00:15:50.800
 This was a publicity stunt by Pizza Hut in the early 2000s. They claimed that they were the first

00:15:50.800 --> 00:15:57.040
 company in the world to deliver a pizza to outer space because the company sent one on a Russian

00:15:57.040 --> 00:16:02.480
 rocket to the International Space Station and then Yuri Usichov, one of the Russian cosmonauts,

00:16:02.480 --> 00:16:07.840
 living there, ate it and Pizza Hut paid about 700,000 quid for that. So I think we can all agree,

00:16:07.840 --> 00:16:11.520
 money was spent. It is now that they've got this kind of promotion from the QI podcast.

00:16:11.520 --> 00:16:16.080
 Before they were wondering if anything had happened to it. Yeah, but they paid all this money.

00:16:16.080 --> 00:16:22.080
 And in return, they got to do that. Then they got footage of Mr Usichov flashing a thumbs up after

00:16:22.080 --> 00:16:28.240
 eating the pizza and then for pasting the chain's logo on a rocket last year. You do you guys know

00:16:28.240 --> 00:16:35.920
 about Pizza Hut's proposal package? No. So this cot... Sounds romantic. It is romantic, cost $10,000 and

00:16:35.920 --> 00:16:42.560
 $10.00. It was a limited edition offer in 2012 and it came with a red ruby ring, a limousine which

00:16:42.560 --> 00:16:48.160
 took you to your location of choice, flowers, fireworks, a photographer and the cherry on the icing,

00:16:48.160 --> 00:16:52.400
 a $10 dinner box. What's a $10 dinner box? It's like a box with pizza in it and some cheese sticks.

00:16:52.400 --> 00:16:59.200
 Another thing the Pizza Hut has is its own perfume called ode to Pizza Hut. It smells apparently

00:16:59.200 --> 00:17:04.560
 like a freshly opened box of pizza, although a professional smellologist, whatever we're calling them,

00:17:04.560 --> 00:17:10.320
 actually said it smells like cinnamon, baby powder and most overwhelmingly feet. They're not my favorite

00:17:10.320 --> 00:17:15.520
 toppings. Actually, speaking of William Marry Me, this is something I looked into for the last

00:17:15.520 --> 00:17:21.120
 fact we were discussing for the Iceland fact. But the first woman who ever placed a personal ad

00:17:21.120 --> 00:17:27.280
 in a newspaper was immediately committed to an asylum. What did it say? Did it say blah, blah, blah?

00:17:27.280 --> 00:17:33.120
 I'm going to kill everyone, Marry Me. No, she was just committed to doing asylum by the

00:17:33.120 --> 00:17:39.760
 meds. She placed a personal ad in the Manchester weekly journal in 1727. She was called Helen Morrison

00:17:39.760 --> 00:17:43.920
 and the first person to respond was the mayor who had a locked up in an asylum for a month for doing

00:17:43.920 --> 00:17:49.440
 something so completeness. I don't believe that. When was the last time you were in Manchester?

00:17:49.440 --> 00:17:57.600
 I don't mean much. A few things about weather. Okay. On planets, the great dark spot on Neptune has

00:17:57.600 --> 00:18:04.320
 winds of 1,500 miles per hour. If there winds anywhere on Earth, for instance, are more than

00:18:04.320 --> 00:18:10.480
 about 120 miles an hour, it's no longer possible to stay upright and it's 1,500 miles an hour there,

00:18:10.480 --> 00:18:15.360
 so 10 times more. So you're telling us if you opened an umbrella, you would fly. You would fly.

00:18:15.360 --> 00:18:21.520
 Well, you would certainly be throwing along the floor if not fly. Awesome. Also on Mars, the

00:18:21.520 --> 00:18:28.960
 atmosphere is so thin on Mars that if you stood at the equator at noon, it would feel like summer

00:18:28.960 --> 00:18:36.240
 at your feet and winter at your head. Wow. Wow. So crouched to eat your pizza, stand up to eat your

00:18:36.240 --> 00:18:42.000
 ice cream dessert. The beautiful clouds floating around your midwreff. Yeah, it's very thin, so you

00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:47.520
 wouldn't really see much of it. Would it be like being a giant on Earth? Yeah. Maybe. I'm just trying

00:18:47.520 --> 00:18:52.160
 to get a clear sense of what it would look like to be there. I was looking at weird ways to cook stuff,

00:18:52.160 --> 00:18:57.200
 okay? Because, you know, pizza on Venus, a weird way to cook stuff, tips for other weird ways to cook

00:18:57.200 --> 00:19:01.360
 stuff. If your oven's broken, poaching salmon in the dishwasher, apparently what actually works,

00:19:01.360 --> 00:19:06.400
 have you, does it work? Yeah. Yeah. It's great. Rapid and tin foil. Yeah. A cook on top of your car

00:19:06.400 --> 00:19:09.840
 engine, you've got a drive for about an hour in your car for something to cook properly like an egg,

00:19:09.840 --> 00:19:13.920
 but the other good way to cook something when your oven's broken is to put it in the middle of

00:19:13.920 --> 00:19:19.120
 a compost heap. And so there's a guy who likes to do this, I was reading his blog and it gets really

00:19:19.120 --> 00:19:24.240
 hot in the middle of compost heaps. So in fact, once our compost heap and our garden set on fire,

00:19:24.240 --> 00:19:30.640
 it was mental and our garden, but also composty. Yeah, so maybe you know, wrap it in foil again,

00:19:30.640 --> 00:19:36.720
 but this guy says, I quote, now whenever I hanker for a real breakfast treat, I drop a few eggs in

00:19:36.720 --> 00:19:42.000
 the compost heap in the evening and look forward to a morning feast. Be sure when he says drop a few eggs.

00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:54.320
 Okay, time for the final fact of the show. And that is my fact. And my fact this week is that in Iceland,

00:19:54.320 --> 00:19:58.240
 there is a phone app that tells you if you're related to the person that you're hitting on.

00:19:58.240 --> 00:20:02.960
 Okay, I don't usually go to frozen food supermarkets to hit some people, but maybe you do.

00:20:02.960 --> 00:20:06.640
 Okay, the country, Iceland, they've got a really small population over there.

00:20:06.640 --> 00:20:12.800
 Some like 320,000 people, so many people were accidentally finding out, you know, in the bedroom chat in

00:20:12.800 --> 00:20:17.760
 the morning. So like, oh, so what do you want today? Oh, go to my, my mom's, my mom's barbecue.

00:20:17.760 --> 00:20:21.920
 Oh, I'm going to a barbecue today. Oh, what's up? Oh, my God. Cousin too.

00:20:21.920 --> 00:20:25.520
 Yeah, that's that's how it works. My grandmother's birthday today. Oh, me too, too.

00:20:25.520 --> 00:20:34.160
 Yeah, so where do you live? Just in the next bedroom, actually. Yeah, so this is this is a really

00:20:34.160 --> 00:20:38.880
 important app because they want to stop the gene pool from becoming incestuous. And it's basically

00:20:38.880 --> 00:20:42.800
 in a bar, you both have the app on your phones, you bump the phones, their motto is bump phones before

00:20:42.800 --> 00:20:47.600
 you bump in the bed. And the idea is that then tells you whether or not you're related. It's very

00:20:47.600 --> 00:20:52.000
 clever. That's great. Isn't the feature, the specific feature in this app is called, I'm going to

00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:59.600
 mispronounce this, sif yasperspilia, which is called the incest spoiler. Yeah, it's got negative

00:20:59.600 --> 00:21:03.680
 connotations. It implies you're ruining something that could have been otherwise a bit of an experience.

00:21:03.680 --> 00:21:10.160
 Sounds like you wanted incest incest spoiler alert. It's what you would receive with your phone.

00:21:10.160 --> 00:21:17.040
 Incest spoiler alert. Yeah. That's so good. But yeah, I just think that's what I really love most about

00:21:17.040 --> 00:21:22.640
 it other than like it's it's a very interesting app. Is the fact that apps are getting to the point

00:21:22.640 --> 00:21:28.960
 now where we've just got so many options of lifestyle choices via reading a little app that we,

00:21:28.960 --> 00:21:34.800
 you know, my friend knew that she was giving birth because her pregnancy contraction app told her,

00:21:34.800 --> 00:21:41.520
 I mean, yeah, I don't know how that works. There also in Japan at the moment, there's a new app,

00:21:41.520 --> 00:21:48.880
 which, okay, basically, this sounds really weird, but there's a bra now in Japan that doesn't come off

00:21:48.880 --> 00:21:53.920
 unless you truly love the person that you're talking to or that you're having relationships.

00:21:53.920 --> 00:21:59.760
 You're kind of like a chastity bra and the way that it knows that you do like the person is something in

00:21:59.760 --> 00:22:05.520
 the bra that monitors your pulsating heart, your heart then sends a message to your iPhone where there

00:22:05.520 --> 00:22:11.200
 is an app that releases the bra and then it can come off. What about when you go go to sleep at the end

00:22:11.200 --> 00:22:17.360
 of the day and you want to take a bra off? You have to feign being in love. And also fast a heart rate.

00:22:17.360 --> 00:22:22.800
 What if you're being mugged and then your bra comes off? Those photographs son rollercoasters will be

00:22:22.800 --> 00:22:30.720
 really interesting. Everyone's bra, so I don't know. It wasn't scared. That's not what you're pressed to say.

00:22:30.720 --> 00:22:40.000
 There was an app in Azerbaijan in 2013 that would tell you the results of the election as soon as the

00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:46.080
 results came in. Unfortunately, anyone who downloaded it got a message the day before the polls opened

00:22:46.080 --> 00:22:54.800
 saying there was a massive landslide for the current president. There's a really good one I read about

00:22:54.800 --> 00:23:00.240
 the other day called Run P and it's an app and the idea behind it is so you know when you're in the

00:23:00.240 --> 00:23:04.240
 cinema and you're watching a movie and you really need the toilet but it's a great movie and you're

00:23:04.240 --> 00:23:09.040
 going I have no idea when I need to go. So the app is you open it up and you type in the name of the

00:23:09.040 --> 00:23:13.520
 movie that you're watching and people have watched the movie before have put this into the app. So if

00:23:13.520 --> 00:23:18.000
 you're watching Guardians of the Galaxy it will say one hour 28 minutes in you're going to get to a scene

00:23:18.000 --> 00:23:22.880
 that says that's like this. Perfect time to go. It's a boring scene. It's not needed to know the rest of

00:23:22.880 --> 00:23:27.440
 the plot. So it tells you exactly in every movie where you need to go for a P. That's good. That's so

00:23:27.440 --> 00:23:36.880
 good. It's really great. Wow. Okay, incest. Should we talk about incest? Yes, please. So in Hawaii they

00:23:36.880 --> 00:23:45.280
 used to revere incest and they had a system called Nia Upo-Oh whose aim was to keep the royal lineage

00:23:45.280 --> 00:23:50.960
 as clear as possible and the very top of the society was a Kapu and that was a product of a royal

00:23:50.960 --> 00:23:55.760
 brother and sister and if you were the son or daughter of a royal brother or sister you were

00:23:55.760 --> 00:24:04.000
 considered a god. Partly because you had seven legs and we're blue. Yeah. Wow, weird. Yeah. So in

00:24:04.000 --> 00:24:09.600
 Russia, China, Ivory Coast, Spain, Portugal and quite a few other places it's not illegal to commit

00:24:09.600 --> 00:24:16.720
 incest but in Korea it's really illegal and actually you can't not allow to marry anyone who's

00:24:16.720 --> 00:24:23.520
 related more closely than 8th cousin. Oh my god. Yeah. Although obviously it's difficult to check that.

00:24:23.520 --> 00:24:29.120
 You're not allowed to knowingly do that but you by law I think you have to check that they're not

00:24:29.120 --> 00:24:34.720
 second cousins. In South Korea you're not it was decreed in 3008 that if you had the same surname as

00:24:34.720 --> 00:24:39.440
 someone else you couldn't marry them because of this incest. However a fifth of people in South

00:24:39.440 --> 00:24:43.520
 Korea have the surname Kim so there are all these people who might love each other very much and be

00:24:43.520 --> 00:24:48.480
 very distantly not related at all essentially but legally they weren't allowed to marry. So I think

00:24:48.480 --> 00:24:52.960
 they've changed it now. Have they a little bit? Yeah, they have. In 1997 it was repealed but before

00:24:52.960 --> 00:24:57.520
 that every so often they would just have an amnesty and say okay a few ten thousand of you can get

00:24:57.520 --> 00:25:01.520
 married to each other. Interesting. Yeah that's very interesting. Yeah it is. I was going to talk about

00:25:01.520 --> 00:25:05.920
 Iceland. Does anyone interested in Iceland? I love Iceland. Have you been to Iceland?

00:25:05.920 --> 00:25:12.320
 Yes I have. I always think Iceland is like a geography teacher's best ever thing because it's got

00:25:12.320 --> 00:25:16.560
 everything like what it is. Oh my god it's worth flakes and you know tectonic plates and everything

00:25:16.560 --> 00:25:22.960
 that geezers. Yeah. They also believe in elves which is very exciting. Oh yeah. 54% I think it's

00:25:22.960 --> 00:25:29.120
 in 1998. Well yeah I remember because I only know this because John Lloyd told me this years ago he

00:25:29.120 --> 00:25:36.480
 said that 54% believe in it but if you get them drunk something like 90% admit that they actually

00:25:36.480 --> 00:25:41.440
 believe in it. I'm so really like that's great. There was quite a good comment from an Icelandic

00:25:41.440 --> 00:25:45.840
 academic who was saying you say that it's geographically fascinating who was saying you can completely

00:25:45.840 --> 00:25:50.480
 believe if you've lived there and grown up there the earth is so volatile and moving all the time and

00:25:50.480 --> 00:25:54.320
 whips the smoke shooting up out of the ground and stuff it's kind of not surprising that people think

00:25:54.320 --> 00:25:59.920
 there are spirits everywhere and there's a really sweet story of a politician an Icelandic politician

00:25:59.920 --> 00:26:06.240
 a couple of years ago his cast ban off the road and he said that he was saved from any injury by elves

00:26:06.240 --> 00:26:11.360
 and then a short while later they were going to build over the elf home and the elves lived in a nearby

00:26:11.360 --> 00:26:15.920
 boulder and so the politician said no you can't do that and said we'll have to move the boulder

00:26:15.920 --> 00:26:19.920
 that the elves live in so they got someone who speaks to elves to talk to the elves who are

00:26:19.920 --> 00:26:23.600
 invisible to most people and they said okay you can move our boulder but we really need to have a

00:26:23.600 --> 00:26:27.920
 view of the sea and it's got to be on grass because we like to keep sheep also invisible sheep

00:26:27.920 --> 00:26:33.440
 south facing garden yeah and they did invisible tiny elf size sheep uh that you know elves are

00:26:33.440 --> 00:26:38.720
 human sizes Icelandic elves are they yeah oh I see people but they're invisible way they look like

00:26:38.720 --> 00:26:44.160
 people but they're invisible that is the only difference the car I didn't know they were I didn't

00:26:44.160 --> 00:26:48.240
 know they were man sizes it were um should we move on I was just going to say quickly uh because I

00:26:48.240 --> 00:26:51.600
 think I think I must be one of James's favorite museums or whichever one of you loves weird museums

00:26:51.600 --> 00:26:55.920
 Iceland has the phallological museum and that has as well which is the penis museum
