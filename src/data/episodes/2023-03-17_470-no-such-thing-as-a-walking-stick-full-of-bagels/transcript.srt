00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,280
 Hi everybody, Andy here. Just before we start this week's show, we have two exciting announcements

2
00:00:06,280 --> 00:00:12,200
 to make. The first is about who our special guest is this week. She is a brilliant Canadian

3
00:00:12,200 --> 00:00:19,900
 writer, screenwriter, showrunner, now also a first time author. She is Monica Heisey

4
00:00:19,900 --> 00:00:24,480
 and her debut novel, Really Good Actually is out within the last few weeks and it is

5
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:29,120
 unsurprisingly really good actually. It's all about the life and travails of a woman

6
00:00:29,120 --> 00:00:34,040
 who has become a surprisingly young divorcee. It is extremely funny. It's kind of, you

7
00:00:34,040 --> 00:00:39,560
 know, accidentally snort milk out of your nose funny. It's great. Highly recommended.

8
00:00:39,560 --> 00:00:43,800
 So we hope you enjoy the show. Monica was great as you will hear shortly. The second

9
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:48,800
 announcement we have to make is that we are doing a live show of no such thing as a fish.

10
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:53,720
 Very exciting. We are going to be at the Hallowed British Library in London. They are having

11
00:00:53,720 --> 00:00:59,480
 a season all about animals and as part of that, we are doing a show called Fantastic Beasts.

12
00:00:59,480 --> 00:01:03,540
 It's going to be Dan, James, myself and a special guest to be announced. It's going

13
00:01:03,540 --> 00:01:07,120
 to be on the 21st of April and if you don't live anywhere near the British Library, there

14
00:01:07,120 --> 00:01:14,520
 is also going to be a streamed version of it. So just go to no such thing as a fish.com/live.

15
00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:18,720
 You will see there the tickets are available for our British Library show. So check it

16
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:36,200
 out. Okay, that's it. That's all of the announcements on with the show.

17
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:41,680
 Hello and welcome to another episode of no such thing as a fish, a weekly podcast coming

18
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:47,440
 to you from four undisclosed locations in the UK. My name is Dan Schreiber. I am sitting

19
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:52,720
 here with James Harkin, Andrew Hunter Murray and Monica Heisei. And once again, we have

20
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:57,040
 gathered around the microphones with our four favorite facts from the last seven days.

21
00:01:57,040 --> 00:02:04,040
 And in a particular order here we go. Starting with fact number one, that is Monica.

22
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:10,080
 So my fact is that in ancient Hebrew times, men could get a divorce if their wife had

23
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:14,560
 been alone in a room with another man. And I was really interested in this fact because

24
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:21,000
 my divorce lawyer told me that this may still be true. I couldn't find anything backing

25
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:27,080
 up, but she basically said if he could prove that a man and a woman had been alone together

26
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:32,360
 in a room for more than an hour, it could be reasonably assumed legally that adultery

27
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:35,600
 had occurred. I think we should just say that we're not all in the same room at the

28
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:42,680
 moment. I think that's very important. No. I think people were a bit desperate because

29
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:48,200
 it used to be that you could only get divorced for five reasons, one of which was adultery.

30
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:51,840
 And so I think people just could stretch it a bit to prove you really just trying to get

31
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:56,560
 out. The history of what you needed to say or

32
00:02:56,560 --> 00:03:00,920
 allege or agree that you had been doing to get divorced is absolutely mad. For a long

33
00:03:00,920 --> 00:03:06,400
 time it was only adultery or adultery was the only substantial grounds and then they

34
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:10,120
 introduced other ones a bit later on. But there was one rule where if one of you had

35
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:15,720
 committed adultery, then your partner could divorce you. But if you both had, they might

36
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:19,840
 not be able to because legally the divorce was kind of an acknowledgement that one person

37
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:24,840
 had committed wrong with the other was being like an eye for an eye and a shag for a shag.

38
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:30,120
 Yeah. And if you'd both done it, then you weren't allowed to lie saying, "Oh, I've committed

39
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:34,800
 adulterally." Sorry, that's a Ned Flanders version of adultery. You weren't allowed to

40
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:39,280
 lie saying you'd committed adultery. That's perjury. So they made it very, very difficult.

41
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:45,240
 Well, that's religion for you. And also it was a very specific definition as well. Adultery

42
00:03:45,240 --> 00:03:52,120
 legally is a married person having full sex with someone of the opposite gender. So if

43
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:56,640
 your husband had a gay affair and you were a woman, you couldn't sue him for divorce

44
00:03:56,640 --> 00:04:00,560
 on grounds of adultery, but you could sue him for unreasonable behavior.

45
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:06,320
 No, really? Yeah. Wow. This thing in the Jewish law, this is from the Mishnah, which is the

46
00:04:06,320 --> 00:04:12,120
 oldest written question of Jewish oral traditions. And the thing is that because if the woman

47
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:18,120
 had been in a room with another man, in theory, there can't be any other witnesses, right?

48
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:22,200
 Because it's basically one person's word against another person's word. And okay, you have

49
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:25,960
 the perjury thing. But what they would do is they would give you the ordeal of bitter

50
00:04:25,960 --> 00:04:31,040
 water. And this was to tell if you were telling the truth or not. So they would give the woman

51
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:37,240
 some water with some dust in it. And it's not really clear what the dust is. It might

52
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:42,720
 be bits of barley, it might be bits of something else. And the idea is if the woman drinks it

53
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:47,360
 and the water is so bitter that she has to like spit it out. And then that proves that

54
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:48,360
 she was in the wrong.

55
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:49,360
 God, it's like witch trials.

56
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:52,360
 A little bit like that. It's a trial by ordeal though, we can't let it.

57
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:57,160
 I feel like I give myself this test every morning when I try for one sip of the water that's

58
00:04:57,160 --> 00:04:59,200
 been out by my bedside table all night.

59
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:05,120
 I'll tell you, the worst divorce situation I read about in this research was to do with

60
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:08,120
 if you were divorcing the king of Thailand.

61
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:13,520
 The problem is that if you go to divorce the king of Thailand, you have to obviously accuse

62
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:18,600
 the king of Thailand of reasons for the divorce. Unfortunately, by law in Thailand, you were

63
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:24,080
 not allowed to accuse the king of anything. So when the current king's divorce case was

64
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:28,320
 going on, I think he was the crown prince at the time, he went to court and he made

65
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:33,120
 all these accusations against the wife. And the wife had to just say, "Yeah, he was fine.

66
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:38,320
 Couldn't say anything. Couldn't defend himself." Yeah. So he obviously won.

67
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:44,600
 I've got a fact about the king of Thailand. Do you remember the king and I, the play or

68
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:45,600
 Mee's Coldplay?

69
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:46,600
 Yeah.

70
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:52,880
 It's about someone called Anna Leonowens who went to work for the king of Thailand. And

71
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:58,400
 the real life Anna Leonowens was the great aunt of Boris Karloff who played, was it

72
00:05:58,400 --> 00:05:59,400
 Frankenstein or?

73
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:00,400
 Yeah.

74
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:03,400
 Yeah. Yeah. It's just a fact.

75
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:09,480
 It's just two people you wouldn't expect to be related to each other, I reckon.

76
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:14,080
 Yes. Yeah. That's very true. Like Ben Elton and Luke Longley are brothers-in-law. That would

77
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:16,880
 mean nothing to no one except Australians. Yeah.

78
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:19,200
 I've never heard of Luke. Who's Luke Longley?

79
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:23,280
 One of the great Australian basketball players played with the Chicago Bulls in the Michael

80
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:25,600
 Jordan period. He's a legend.

81
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:30,480
 One of the great Australian basketball players. How big is this cohort?

82
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:35,920
 There's three of them. And one of them is related by marriage, but not blood to Ben Elton.

83
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:36,920
 Amazing.

84
00:06:36,920 --> 00:06:39,440
 Gosh. Why didn't you pick that as your headline fact this week, Darren?

85
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:43,600
 I've been pitching it for nine years, you guys. Swatting it away every week. I found

86
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:48,640
 a modern divorce story, which I can't believe that this is true, but it was reported in a

87
00:06:48,640 --> 00:06:56,960
 bunch of places. So this is to do with a Bosnian couple, Sana Klarek and her husband, Adnan.

88
00:06:56,960 --> 00:07:03,000
 And Adnan had not been happy in the marriage, and he started looking around for love and

89
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:07,840
 he went online. And so he started chatting to someone online. He used a fake name just

90
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:13,000
 to make sure that no one could clock on to who he was. He met someone. He said, "I suddenly

91
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:16,600
 was in love again. It was beautiful. I thought I'd finally found someone who understands

92
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:21,920
 me and who's in a similar situation in a bad marriage like I am." So they decided to meet

93
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:29,080
 up. And they meet up and he sees a city in the spot where his online love should be.

94
00:07:29,080 --> 00:07:34,920
 His wife, who has also gone online, created a pseudonym, looked for love. They found each

95
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:39,640
 other. And what's remarkable is that is how they found out that each of them were basically

96
00:07:39,640 --> 00:07:44,760
 cheating on each other and divorced off the back of it, despite falling back in love with

97
00:07:44,760 --> 00:07:48,900
 each other in this online scenario. They looked at it as negative.

98
00:07:48,900 --> 00:07:52,440
 Reverse Pina Colada song.

99
00:07:52,440 --> 00:07:56,200
 It's like a Richard Curtis film until the last sentence, isn't it?

100
00:07:56,200 --> 00:07:59,640
 Yeah. Yeah. Super plot twist in the end there.

101
00:07:59,640 --> 00:08:05,640
 There was a guy in New York. He was from New York anyway. And he divorced his wife in Dominican

102
00:08:05,640 --> 00:08:13,240
 Republic and she didn't find out for 22 years. So he filled in the form and got her to sign

103
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:18,480
 something which she didn't know what she was signing. And he got an official divorce and

104
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:23,080
 then she only found out when she got a letter through about the house that they owned and

105
00:08:23,080 --> 00:08:26,960
 her name wasn't on the deeds. And she sort of rang her lawyer and said, "What's going

106
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:30,960
 on?" And he said, "Well, it turns out you're not married and you haven't been for 22 years."

107
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:33,160
 But they can't have been living together.

108
00:08:33,160 --> 00:08:34,160
 Yeah.

109
00:08:34,160 --> 00:08:35,160
 What?

110
00:08:35,160 --> 00:08:38,960
 He just didn't tell her that they weren't married anymore. And what she said in the case

111
00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:43,520
 and I couldn't find out what in the end happened, but she said that she thought that he'd done

112
00:08:43,520 --> 00:08:48,280
 it deliberately so that he would own everything. If he left her in the future, she wouldn't

113
00:08:48,280 --> 00:08:49,880
 have any rights. That's what she said.

114
00:08:49,880 --> 00:08:52,000
 But then he stayed with her for decades?

115
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:56,560
 Yeah. Because apparently, I mean, I can't really speak for him. But what she said is

116
00:08:56,560 --> 00:09:02,200
 that the marriage was kind of happy, but he just did it as a kind of backup in case he

117
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:03,200
 needed it in the future.

118
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:04,200
 Oh my God.

119
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:05,200
 Oh no.

120
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:07,200
 That's about that, isn't it?

121
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:13,720
 I became really obsessed with unreasonable behavior as a category. So they changed the

122
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:20,240
 law in 2022 and now you could have a no fault divorce in the UK, which means that you don't

123
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:24,240
 have to identify a guilty parting. You can just both agree that you want to dissolve

124
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:28,880
 your marriage. But prior to that, you had to pick one of these five categories, kind

125
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:33,360
 of whether or not there was something going on. And unreasonable behavior is such a very

126
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:38,760
 capacious category. And I think 51% of women filing for divorce in this country, that was

127
00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:44,360
 their grounds. They're only 36% of men. And a lot of it has to do with gaming. People

128
00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:48,680
 were divorcing because either their husbands were gaming too often, but a lot of them like

129
00:09:48,680 --> 00:09:52,400
 a non-negligible portion, or people who are having digital affairs.

130
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:55,800
 So you're basically meeting someone via, not by fortnight.

131
00:09:55,800 --> 00:10:02,560
 Your Sims avatar is having sex with someone else's Sim.

132
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:07,600
 So what are the other limits to this, what was it called again?

133
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:08,600
 Unreasonable behavior.

134
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:09,600
 Unreasonable behavior.

135
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:11,160
 What are you worried about, Dan?

136
00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:16,720
 Excessive Ben Elton memorabilia purchases from eBay. Is that, do I need to watch out?

137
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:23,760
 I do think it's a very bendy category. It basically is like a prolonged commitment to behavior

138
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:29,920
 that is a problem to the marriage. So that can include like actively building a life separate

139
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:35,480
 to your partner. If you're developing too many not shared interests, or you're really

140
00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:41,040
 going hard on, I don't know, you have a new hobby and you're going away and pursuing rock

141
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:45,840
 climbing all the time, and your partner is no interested in whatsoever. Eventually, after

142
00:10:45,840 --> 00:10:49,560
 a certain amount of rock climbing, I suppose it can become unreasonable.

143
00:10:49,560 --> 00:10:55,360
 I think reckless spending counts as well. If you're spending loads of money on Ben Elton

144
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:56,360
 memorabilia, Dan.

145
00:10:56,360 --> 00:11:01,660
 I'm done. Yeah. Did you guys ever hear of the Brighton Quickie?

146
00:11:01,660 --> 00:11:05,200
 This is a divorce practice. And I've done a fair bit of reading about it. I can't quite

147
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:09,680
 work out how real it was. Basically, in 1923, the law was changed saying you could petition

148
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:13,760
 on adultery only. It was the only grounds for divorce. And that led to this thing where

149
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:17,640
 it's kind of like Monica's original fact about the being in a room together. You would

150
00:11:17,640 --> 00:11:22,000
 go down, as the husband, you would agree to be the adulterer. You'd book a hotel room

151
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:26,800
 in Brighton because it's easy on the train from London. You spend the night there with

152
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:31,120
 a woman you don't know. You don't have sex or anything. But there's a hotel receipt saying

153
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:35,000
 you've booked a room for two the next morning. Maybe you're witnessed by the chambermaid.

154
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,760
 You could two pairs of shoes outside the door.

155
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:43,440
 Exactly. Exactly. And there's then a small body of evidence that you can use to get your

156
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:44,440
 divorce.

157
00:11:44,440 --> 00:11:45,440
 And then Tim's link back.

158
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:50,040
 Yeah. You haven't even got to commit adultery, but you will be divorced in due course. But

159
00:11:50,040 --> 00:11:54,960
 I just can't tell how much it actually happened if at all. It's in a few novels and it's

160
00:11:54,960 --> 00:11:55,960
 written about at the time.

161
00:11:55,960 --> 00:11:56,960
 But it's not.

162
00:11:56,960 --> 00:12:00,800
 Also, how important is the chambermaid in this? Are all the rooms in this hotel packed

163
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:03,800
 with people going for a Brighton quickie? And she's got to sort of be...

164
00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:04,800
 She's the witness.

165
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:08,480
 Yeah. She's the witness for like 40 things a day where she has to...

166
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:12,800
 Was that... Yeah. Then I saw the shoes outside that door. And then was it the pancakes?

167
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:17,760
 I took a tea and they were on top of the bed. There was a pillow on the floor. So that's

168
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:18,760
 suggestive.

169
00:12:18,760 --> 00:12:22,840
 I read that in Delaware and Colorado, you can get your marriage annulled if you did

170
00:12:22,840 --> 00:12:30,480
 it for a dare. But none of the other 48 states is that explicitly in the rules. Like probably

171
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:33,600
 you still could get an annullment if you said that but you would have to go into something

172
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:38,980
 else. But in those two states, it explicitly says it is illegal to get married on a dare.

173
00:12:38,980 --> 00:12:41,520
 I mean, all marriages are kind of a dare.

174
00:12:41,520 --> 00:12:42,520
 Oh, they're?

175
00:12:42,520 --> 00:12:43,520
 Yeah.

176
00:12:43,520 --> 00:12:44,520
 That's what a proposal is. It's a big dare.

177
00:12:44,520 --> 00:12:48,200
 Yeah. I dare you to stay with me until one or both of us dies.

178
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:50,560
 I bet your wife is wishing she shows truth though.

179
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:52,920
 Yeah. Every day.

180
00:12:52,920 --> 00:12:59,440
 I got a thing which is one of really classic Marvin Gaye albums, which was called Here,

181
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:04,980
 My Dear, was made within a divorce proceeding whereby Marvin Gaye didn't quite have the

182
00:13:04,980 --> 00:13:10,360
 alimony that he needed to pay for his child. And so the agreement was the next album that

183
00:13:10,360 --> 00:13:15,120
 you do, your wife, who you're now divorcing, is going to get half of the money, royalties

184
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:20,720
 and the upfront money from the album itself. And he decided, well, I don't want her making

185
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:24,640
 any money. So I'm going to do a quickie album basically. I'm just going to not really do

186
00:13:24,640 --> 00:13:28,200
 anything good. It's going to come out and it's just going to be panned by the critics.

187
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:33,000
 No one's going to like it. And then suddenly he got fascinated by the notion of this album

188
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:38,000
 and ended up putting more heart and soul into this album, possibly than any of his other

189
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:41,720
 albums. He was really hands on. He wrote the lyrics. He never writes lyrics for his songs

190
00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:46,120
 according to the stuff that I was reading. He never really was hands on with playing

191
00:13:46,120 --> 00:13:51,060
 the piano. But in this album, he insisted on doing the lyrics, the piano. And it was

192
00:13:51,060 --> 00:13:55,160
 panned at the time, but it's been, it's one of those albums that's been reviewed by everyone

193
00:13:55,160 --> 00:14:00,880
 since, you know, the Rolling Stone has named it one of the best 500 albums ever made three

194
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:04,800
 times in lists that they released. And it constantly appears on these lists now, but

195
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:08,240
 it was a, it's a pure divorce album. Pretty cool.

196
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:11,540
 What's the story of the producers, the film the producers done? We've just done, you've

197
00:14:11,540 --> 00:14:15,640
 given us a fact, which is the song Pina Colada, and now you've given us the film, the producers,

198
00:14:15,640 --> 00:14:17,480
 but you've translated it to being about Marvin Gaye.

199
00:14:17,480 --> 00:14:18,480
 No, no, no.

200
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:20,000
 We see you. We see what you do.

201
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:24,640
 They made it bad. He made this good during the process. The producers was bad.

202
00:14:24,640 --> 00:14:29,440
 I wonder at what point he decided to start making it good. Like if he's like, I'm going

203
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:34,320
 to make it so bad. And then what day did he realize, oh, I'm actually very invested.

204
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:35,920
 I'm really trying quite hard now.

205
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:36,920
 Yeah. I don't know.

206
00:14:36,920 --> 00:14:39,720
 I guess if you're an artist, it's going to be really hard to go. I'll just put out a

207
00:14:39,720 --> 00:14:44,400
 shit album. Like that's, that must be a painful thing to do, to make a decision on.

208
00:14:44,400 --> 00:14:49,520
 I don't know. Some of them managed, don't they? But I think like, I think if he didn't

209
00:14:49,520 --> 00:14:53,920
 normally play piano and didn't normally write the lyrics, and then he started doing it,

210
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:57,600
 he must have not normally done it because he didn't think he was as good as the people

211
00:14:57,600 --> 00:15:01,680
 who were doing it, right? Originally. And then when he started doing it, he's like, oh,

212
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:02,680
 this is pretty good.

213
00:15:02,680 --> 00:15:08,040
 It's also a little bit self myth making. I tried to make an album which said I've made

214
00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:11,440
 one of the 500 greatest of all time.

215
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:13,920
 Oh, that's just me.

216
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:22,000
 Okay, it is time for fact number two. And that is Andy.

217
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:27,480
 My fact is that the same fingers are responsible for the clicks in the Adams family theme,

218
00:15:27,480 --> 00:15:33,440
 the bongos in the Mission Impossible theme, and the xylophone in the Simpsons theme. The

219
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:39,120
 same human fingers created three of the great artworks of the 20th century. I think it's

220
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:41,520
 unbelievable. I think it's so great.

221
00:15:41,520 --> 00:15:44,160
 Would you say that you play the xylophone with your fingers?

222
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:45,760
 I was going to question that.

223
00:15:45,760 --> 00:15:46,760
 Yeah.

224
00:15:46,760 --> 00:15:54,320
 His name was Woodfingers Richards and he, he was incredible. You know what fingers Richards,

225
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:59,960
 when he clicked his fingers for the Adams family, he set himself on fire.

226
00:15:59,960 --> 00:16:04,000
 Emil Richards, he was a hero of percussion. I should say where I got this. It was via

227
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:08,240
 a brilliant piece published each year by a guy called Tom Whitwell, which is a 52 things

228
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:12,120
 you learn each year. I think I may have mentioned him before, either one or two or three years

229
00:16:12,120 --> 00:16:15,440
 ago, but anyway, it's a brilliant list. And this is one of the facts. I just couldn't

230
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:21,880
 believe it. And Emil Richards, it turns out, born 1932, died 2019 in between those two dates,

231
00:16:21,880 --> 00:16:25,000
 at the most amazing musical career.

232
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,000
 Yeah.

233
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:31,440
 He played with Frank Sinatra. He toured with George Harrison. He was one of the most amazing

234
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:34,800
 session musicians ever. The list of people who played with this just,

235
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:39,840
 He played with Charlie Mingus, you know, he was proppered into the scene of jazz and blues

236
00:16:39,840 --> 00:16:43,960
 and, and then, yeah, as you say, he went on tour and also played on three George Harrison

237
00:16:43,960 --> 00:16:49,920
 albums. He was inducted into the Percussive Arts Society Hall of Fame in 1994. That's

238
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:52,760
 a very hard Hall of Fame to get into.

239
00:16:52,760 --> 00:16:55,760
 Is it harder to get into than the Australian Basketball Hall of Fame?

240
00:16:55,760 --> 00:16:56,760
 Yes.

241
00:16:56,760 --> 00:17:01,480
 I imagine to get in, you have to do a special knock to get into the Percussive Art of Fame.

242
00:17:01,480 --> 00:17:04,160
 But no, yeah, what an extraordinary guy.

243
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:08,580
 Yeah, it's amazing. Frank Zafer, Doris Day, The Beach Boys, The Bee Gees, Blondie, Ella

244
00:17:08,580 --> 00:17:13,040
 Fitzgerald, Marvin Gaye. I don't know if it was on the, the album.

245
00:17:13,040 --> 00:17:14,040
 Oh, imagine.

246
00:17:14,040 --> 00:17:17,320
 What? I think, I think Marvin did all his finger clicks on that album.

247
00:17:17,320 --> 00:17:23,160
 Right, okay. He was just incredible. I love this. His autobiography was called My Life

248
00:17:23,160 --> 00:17:24,160
 Behind Bars.

249
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:25,160
 Oh, very nice.

250
00:17:25,160 --> 00:17:30,520
 Oh, you may have come across this in the course of your research. Do you, can you guess what

251
00:17:30,520 --> 00:17:33,080
 kind of animal he wanted to come back as in the next life?

252
00:17:33,080 --> 00:17:34,080
 Oh, I didn't see that.

253
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:35,080
 I did not see that.

254
00:17:35,080 --> 00:17:38,120
 Something, something percussive. So, uh...

255
00:17:38,120 --> 00:17:39,120
 Woodpecker.

256
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:42,240
 Oh, such a good, such a good guess. I wish it was that.

257
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:43,920
 Imagine it's just totally unrelated.

258
00:17:43,920 --> 00:17:46,200
 No, no, no. It is related to his percussionist life.

259
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:47,200
 Oh, it is.

260
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:48,200
 He had an octopus.

261
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:50,200
 Oh, so he can have more arms.

262
00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:53,160
 Woodpecker is better, actually, yeah.

263
00:17:53,160 --> 00:17:57,560
 Six of them are legs in an octopus.

264
00:17:57,560 --> 00:18:00,440
 He had the world's largest collection of percussive instruments.

265
00:18:00,440 --> 00:18:01,440
 Really?

266
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:05,640
 This guy, yeah, he had 700, over 770.

267
00:18:05,640 --> 00:18:16,120
 I don't know if that's 771, maybe, but he, he had an angklung, a bulbul terang, a chimta,

268
00:18:16,120 --> 00:18:23,560
 a flapamba, a jengu, a mvira, and a pak havaj.

269
00:18:23,560 --> 00:18:27,280
 When I was looking him up, they said he's a, he plays the vibraphone and I went to look

270
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:31,840
 up what a vibraphone was and the first thing that just said not to be confused with the

271
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:32,840
 vibraphlap.

272
00:18:32,840 --> 00:18:35,240
 And what is that?

273
00:18:35,240 --> 00:18:36,240
 Always getting them fixed up.

274
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:40,600
 The vibraphlap is, have you ever seen that instrument? It's like a piece of wire bent

275
00:18:40,600 --> 00:18:43,720
 into a U and there's a wooden ball on the end.

276
00:18:43,720 --> 00:18:49,880
 It hits the box. So that's a vibraphlap and a vibraphone is more, looks like a xylophone.

277
00:18:49,880 --> 00:18:51,560
 I don't know how you would confuse them.

278
00:18:51,560 --> 00:18:56,480
 They don't look at all alike and they're both so obscure that I feel like it's very unlikely

279
00:18:56,480 --> 00:19:00,500
 you'll be talking about one and not know what the other one is like either you're not talking

280
00:19:00,500 --> 00:19:06,840
 about these at all or there's no risk of you confusing the two.

281
00:19:06,840 --> 00:19:09,440
 So he did the Mission Impossible theme tune.

282
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:14,680
 The bong goes on that and I was looking into the Mission Impossible theme tune generally.

283
00:19:14,680 --> 00:19:20,480
 So there's this fact, which is that the beat of the song was written to the Morse code

284
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:22,200
 of M and I.

285
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:25,320
 So can you give us the one it goes like for anyone who doesn't.

286
00:19:25,320 --> 00:19:26,600
 Andy, you're a bigger fan.

287
00:19:26,600 --> 00:19:28,400
 I always end up doing Bond by accident.

288
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:29,400
 Can you do it quickly?

289
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:33,960
 Do you mean the bit they go bam, bam, bam, bam, bam, bam, bam, bam, bam, bam, bam.

290
00:19:33,960 --> 00:19:34,960
 Yes.

291
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:35,960
 Yeah.

292
00:19:35,960 --> 00:19:38,680
 So it's dash, dash, dot, dot is the thing for it.

293
00:19:38,680 --> 00:19:39,680
 Great.

294
00:19:39,680 --> 00:19:44,440
 But the guy who wrote it, Shifrin, he wrote that whole song he says in three minutes.

295
00:19:44,440 --> 00:19:45,440
 Wow.

296
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:46,440
 Really?

297
00:19:46,440 --> 00:19:47,440
 Yeah.

298
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:50,000
 You often hear that with a few musicians where they say I just banged that out and it just

299
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:54,320
 came to me as a fully formed piece and that happened and that happened with Mission Impossible.

300
00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:55,320
 So that's quite cool.

301
00:19:55,320 --> 00:19:58,120
 And the same with the James Bond theme.

302
00:19:58,120 --> 00:20:03,600
 That wasn't written in a quick time, but if by a guy called Monty Norman and he actually,

303
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:08,800
 which is, I really like this, he was hired by the Bond people to come up specifically

304
00:20:08,800 --> 00:20:09,800
 with this theme.

305
00:20:09,800 --> 00:20:15,200
 And they took him out to Jamaica on a holiday and he met Connery out there and Ursula Andres.

306
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:17,200
 Because they were filming Dr. No.

307
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:19,240
 Yeah, they were filming Dr. No, the first one out there.

308
00:20:19,240 --> 00:20:22,120
 And so he was brought to meet them all and get a vibe of it.

309
00:20:22,120 --> 00:20:26,680
 And he ended up just using a previous tune that he had written for a completely different

310
00:20:26,680 --> 00:20:28,360
 adaption that never got used.

311
00:20:28,360 --> 00:20:34,040
 It was a stage production of VS Naples' novel, A House for Mr. Biswas.

312
00:20:34,040 --> 00:20:38,160
 That's the original James Bond theme and it was played on Sitar.

313
00:20:38,160 --> 00:20:43,160
 It's the other one that goes da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, oh, because I know the original

314
00:20:43,160 --> 00:20:48,720
 lyrics about something like, I was born with an unfortunate sneeze and yes, that's it.

315
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:52,160
 My parents said that I was made the wrong way around.

316
00:20:52,160 --> 00:20:54,520
 Oh my God.

317
00:20:54,520 --> 00:20:58,520
 This is a bigger repurpose than Candle in the Wind.

318
00:20:58,520 --> 00:21:00,840
 This is a big shift.

319
00:21:00,840 --> 00:21:01,840
 So strange.

320
00:21:01,840 --> 00:21:07,880
 And I think at the end of the song, he sneezes so much that he falls into a lay cuss of that

321
00:21:07,880 --> 00:21:08,880
 tune.

322
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:09,880
 Oh, right.

323
00:21:09,880 --> 00:21:10,880
 Wow.

324
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:13,120
 This guy, Monty Norman, he also wrote an autobiography.

325
00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:15,280
 So Life Behind Bar is a very good title.

326
00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:18,520
 Do you know, Andy, you look like you might know the title of his autobiography.

327
00:21:18,520 --> 00:21:19,520
 No, I don't.

328
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:20,960
 Is it Musical and James Bond theme?

329
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:21,960
 No.

330
00:21:21,960 --> 00:21:22,960
 Well, I'm not going to get it.

331
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:26,160
 It was called A Walking Stick Full of Bagels.

332
00:21:26,160 --> 00:21:27,160
 Okay.

333
00:21:27,160 --> 00:21:28,160
 You know that.

334
00:21:28,160 --> 00:21:30,160
 Without knowing the context, that is not a good title for it.

335
00:21:30,160 --> 00:21:32,720
 I think that must have been a classic phrase back in the day.

336
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:34,480
 You're like a walking stick full of bagels.

337
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:35,640
 And what does that mean?

338
00:21:35,640 --> 00:21:37,360
 How would a stick be full of anything?

339
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:38,360
 There we go.

340
00:21:38,360 --> 00:21:39,360
 Yeah.

341
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:40,360
 So many questions.

342
00:21:40,360 --> 00:21:43,240
 I bet they were all answered in the unpublished autobiography and we are yet to find out.

343
00:21:43,240 --> 00:21:49,160
 I think the best autobiography title I've ever heard was Tori Spelling's Autobiography,

344
00:21:49,160 --> 00:21:51,160
 Storytelling by Tori Spelling.

345
00:21:51,160 --> 00:21:52,160
 Genius.

346
00:21:52,160 --> 00:21:53,160
 Really strong title.

347
00:21:53,160 --> 00:21:54,160
 I've got it.

348
00:21:54,160 --> 00:21:55,160
 I got it off that title.

349
00:21:55,160 --> 00:21:58,160
 But that doesn't go down well in the divorce case.

350
00:21:58,160 --> 00:21:59,160
 Tori Spelling's Autobiography.

351
00:21:59,160 --> 00:22:07,160
 Have you guys heard of the village of Kong Thong in northeast India?

352
00:22:07,160 --> 00:22:08,160
 No.

353
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:12,400
 This is a village where every child is given a theme tune.

354
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:13,400
 Oh, cool.

355
00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:14,920
 So it's a little village.

356
00:22:14,920 --> 00:22:16,960
 It's really cut off from the rest of India.

357
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:18,440
 I don't think you can get that by car.

358
00:22:18,440 --> 00:22:20,880
 I think you can get that by boat.

359
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:26,160
 It's in the middle of a jungle and people would forage for broom grass, which they would

360
00:22:26,160 --> 00:22:27,280
 sell on.

361
00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:31,120
 And so a lot of the time you would spend in the jungle sort of walking around probably

362
00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:32,120
 alone.

363
00:22:32,120 --> 00:22:36,800
 And the thing is in the jungle is quite hard to hear people for long distances because

364
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:39,200
 it all gets soaked in by the trees.

365
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:43,800
 And so they came up with this different way of telling people you're around by having

366
00:22:43,800 --> 00:22:47,560
 a different tune that you would whistle or you would shout or whatever.

367
00:22:47,560 --> 00:22:52,200
 And so when you're born, you get your theme tune and then for the rest of your life, whenever

368
00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:55,080
 you're in the jungle, people will make this little doodoo doodoo doodoo.

369
00:22:55,080 --> 00:22:57,080
 You'd be like, oh, that's me.

370
00:22:57,080 --> 00:22:58,080
 That was the Simpsons.

371
00:22:58,080 --> 00:22:59,080
 So cool.

372
00:22:59,080 --> 00:23:00,080
 Yeah.

373
00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:01,080
 Yeah.

374
00:23:01,080 --> 00:23:05,880
 I think lawyers will be in touch with that kid.

375
00:23:05,880 --> 00:23:09,160
 He was from the Simpson family of Kong Thong.

376
00:23:09,160 --> 00:23:11,080
 That is so cool, isn't it?

377
00:23:11,080 --> 00:23:12,080
 That's awesome.

378
00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:16,320
 Unfortunately, it's kind of dying out because people now will connect with each other using

379
00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:19,680
 mobile phones so they don't need these theme tunes so much.

380
00:23:19,680 --> 00:23:22,720
 Yes, again, the internet's ruined it all.

381
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:28,960
 I'm having a quick think about songs that use the old Panda Rooze as a kind of iconic

382
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:29,960
 bit of it.

383
00:23:29,960 --> 00:23:34,240
 And obviously, if you're thinking theme tunes, the Friends theme tune, I'll be there for

384
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:36,080
 you by the Rem Brands.

385
00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:38,200
 There's like a clapping bit, right?

386
00:23:38,200 --> 00:23:39,200
 Yeah.

387
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:40,200
 So it's four claps.

388
00:23:40,200 --> 00:23:43,520
 Apparently, there's a bit of controversy because Courtney Cox did five claps on a TV

389
00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:46,280
 show once and it sent the writers of the song mad.

390
00:23:46,280 --> 00:23:51,480
 But the song, I'll be there for you, it was actually a song composed specifically for

391
00:23:51,480 --> 00:23:55,560
 the TV show and the Rem Brands had very minimal input into the writing itself.

392
00:23:55,560 --> 00:24:02,000
 It was the actual creators of Friends who wrote the song and it proved to be such an

393
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:06,240
 iconic theme tune that everyone was begging for it to be released in the...

394
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:09,320
 Yeah, I bought it in the chance when it came out.

395
00:24:09,320 --> 00:24:14,120
 So what that was was they had to go into a studio and write a whole song because there

396
00:24:14,120 --> 00:24:15,600
 wasn't a whole song.

397
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:17,760
 It was only the theme tune bit of the song.

398
00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:19,800
 They needed two more verses to be added in.

399
00:24:19,800 --> 00:24:20,800
 Oh, really?

400
00:24:20,800 --> 00:24:21,800
 Yeah.

401
00:24:21,800 --> 00:24:25,320
 So it was a backwards constructed full song that ended up coming out.

402
00:24:25,320 --> 00:24:26,320
 That's so interesting.

403
00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:27,320
 So it was 40 seconds long.

404
00:24:27,320 --> 00:24:31,320
 There was like a time in the 90s when all the theme tunes used to come out and you could

405
00:24:31,320 --> 00:24:35,480
 buy them for the charts like the exfiles did around that time as well.

406
00:24:35,480 --> 00:24:39,080
 And they all did quite well in the charts just because people thought, oh, I like that

407
00:24:39,080 --> 00:24:40,080
 song.

408
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:41,080
 Yeah.

409
00:24:41,080 --> 00:24:42,080
 I love...

410
00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:43,080
 I mean, the exfiles is my favorite theme tune of all time.

411
00:24:43,080 --> 00:24:44,800
 And it turns out, so the guy who composed that's called...

412
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:45,800
 Mark Snow?

413
00:24:45,800 --> 00:24:46,960
 Yeah, Mark Snow.

414
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:49,360
 And David DeColvany claims, I think this is tongue in cheek.

415
00:24:49,360 --> 00:24:53,920
 I mean, it completely is tongue in cheek, but he says there were lyrics to the exfiles

416
00:24:53,920 --> 00:24:58,760
 theme tune by Mark Snow and these are the lyrics.

417
00:24:58,760 --> 00:25:05,400
 The exfiles is a show, show, show, show, show, with music by Mark Snow, snow, snow, snow.

418
00:25:05,400 --> 00:25:10,480
 Those are the only two lyrics that we know of according to DeColvany.

419
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:13,040
 Do you guys know what composers of TV theme tunes hate?

420
00:25:13,040 --> 00:25:14,040
 I guess.

421
00:25:14,040 --> 00:25:21,120
 Oh, when on TV shows, when the continuity announcer goes next up on BBC Three.

422
00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:24,200
 That's a really good point.

423
00:25:24,200 --> 00:25:29,640
 I'm specifically talking about the skip intro button, which is very controversial.

424
00:25:29,640 --> 00:25:34,680
 They get furious, those guys and gals, about the skip intro because Netflix found out that

425
00:25:34,680 --> 00:25:37,680
 users were frequently fast forwarding a bit because, you know, if you're watching three

426
00:25:37,680 --> 00:25:40,560
 episodes in a night, you don't want to see the theme tune three times.

427
00:25:40,560 --> 00:25:45,960
 So Netflix claims, I can't quite believe this, skip intro is pressed 136 million times a

428
00:25:45,960 --> 00:25:51,440
 day, which cumulatively saves 130 years of human time.

429
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:57,200
 We never, especially the shows where they've put some proper effort into the, into the

430
00:25:57,200 --> 00:25:58,200
 intros.

431
00:25:58,200 --> 00:26:00,760
 I think you lose quite a lot from not having those intros.

432
00:26:00,760 --> 00:26:04,840
 Can you imagine watching Game of Thrones and not having that amazing theme tune with

433
00:26:04,840 --> 00:26:09,560
 all the stuff happening and then just going straight into the shaggy nuts?

434
00:26:09,560 --> 00:26:10,560
 Yeah, exactly.

435
00:26:10,560 --> 00:26:11,560
 Yeah.

436
00:26:11,560 --> 00:26:12,560
 It really sets the vibe.

437
00:26:12,560 --> 00:26:17,440
 I think grooving to the soprano's theme is like maybe 30% of what I like about watching

438
00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:18,440
 the show.

439
00:26:18,440 --> 00:26:22,920
 Obviously the rest of the other 70% is that it's groundbreaking, beautiful human drama.

440
00:26:22,920 --> 00:26:25,000
 But the theme tune is also up there.

441
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:26,000
 It's a bop.

442
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:27,000
 I agree.

443
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:28,100
 We stand up in our house.

444
00:26:28,100 --> 00:26:30,440
 We stand in silence for every theme tune.

445
00:26:30,440 --> 00:26:32,960
 It's a huge respect in this household.

446
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:36,280
 Monica, aren't you show running on a show at the moment?

447
00:26:36,280 --> 00:26:38,840
 I just finished show running on a show.

448
00:26:38,840 --> 00:26:40,880
 Are you going to get to pick the theme tune?

449
00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:44,000
 I think we're going to have like proper opening titles.

450
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:46,640
 So we're going to have to do a whole, you're going to have to figure out a whole thing.

451
00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:47,640
 Yeah.

452
00:26:47,640 --> 00:26:50,760
 I've really been shown my own limitations in this area because my description is like,

453
00:26:50,760 --> 00:26:53,200
 I want it to sound cool.

454
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:58,200
 No, out of their fiend back home.

455
00:26:58,200 --> 00:27:00,040
 Well, I got, I got some advice for you, Monica.

456
00:27:00,040 --> 00:27:05,140
 If you're working with the sound person, do a, do a secret thing here, which is do actually

457
00:27:05,140 --> 00:27:11,080
 write lyrics to whatever the theme tune is, but don't put them out because you could then

458
00:27:11,080 --> 00:27:13,640
 claim 50% royalties on the song.

459
00:27:13,640 --> 00:27:16,240
 This is what Jean Roddenberry did with Star Trek.

460
00:27:16,240 --> 00:27:18,400
 He wrote lyrics for the Star Trek song.

461
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:20,120
 They never use them.

462
00:27:20,120 --> 00:27:23,480
 And anytime a royalty check came in, he was a co-writer of the song.

463
00:27:23,480 --> 00:27:25,680
 So he got 50% of everything.

464
00:27:25,680 --> 00:27:27,440
 And the song suicide is painless.

465
00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:28,920
 The mash theme tune.

466
00:27:28,920 --> 00:27:34,880
 It was used in the Robert Altman movie commissioned specifically for that movie by Robert Altman.

467
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:37,660
 And he tried to write the lyrics for it, couldn't crack it.

468
00:27:37,660 --> 00:27:42,940
 And so he asked his son, Michael, who was 15 years old at the time, to write the lyrics.

469
00:27:42,940 --> 00:27:44,580
 So Michael did that.

470
00:27:44,580 --> 00:27:49,260
 And as a result of that song not only being used in the movie, but then the long running

471
00:27:49,260 --> 00:27:54,460
 TV show with Alan Alder, he says, Altman says that he made $70,000 for directing that

472
00:27:54,460 --> 00:27:55,460
 movie.

473
00:27:55,460 --> 00:28:00,100
 And his son has earned more than a million dollars over the years just from that being

474
00:28:00,100 --> 00:28:01,100
 sold.

475
00:28:01,100 --> 00:28:04,020
 Those lyrics are good though, aren't they, for suicide is painless.

476
00:28:04,020 --> 00:28:09,200
 But G. Roddenberry, is he not just stealing half of the credit?

477
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:10,200
 Yeah.

478
00:28:10,200 --> 00:28:11,200
 It feels like it.

479
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:14,840
 It feels like the workers and the musicians who have done all this work and he's just

480
00:28:14,840 --> 00:28:17,840
 like, well, I'll pretend that I've written some lyrics and take half the money.

481
00:28:17,840 --> 00:28:19,240
 It's quite cheeky.

482
00:28:19,240 --> 00:28:20,240
 It's very cheeky.

483
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:22,020
 Hey, that's the business we're in, guys.

484
00:28:22,020 --> 00:28:23,020
 And Monica.

485
00:28:23,020 --> 00:28:24,020
 Is it?

486
00:28:24,020 --> 00:28:25,020
 Oh.

487
00:28:25,020 --> 00:28:26,020
 That's Hollywood, baby.

488
00:28:26,020 --> 00:28:27,020
 Gosh.

489
00:28:27,020 --> 00:28:28,020
 Business is business.

490
00:28:28,020 --> 00:28:33,520
 Just quickly, Ed Sheeran has written the theme tune to James Bond, despite no one having

491
00:28:33,520 --> 00:28:37,380
 requested that he do that, which I think is quite sweet.

492
00:28:37,380 --> 00:28:39,660
 I think that's a very Ed Sheeran thing to do.

493
00:28:39,660 --> 00:28:44,460
 But that's, isn't that, I would say that when a new Bond comes out, people submit songs.

494
00:28:44,460 --> 00:28:45,700
 That's how that's always worked.

495
00:28:45,700 --> 00:28:46,700
 No, it's not.

496
00:28:46,700 --> 00:28:47,700
 You don't send in.

497
00:28:47,700 --> 00:28:51,300
 There are so many songs that are out that are rejected Bond songs by bands that submitted

498
00:28:51,300 --> 00:28:53,980
 a song that didn't get used, which they then use.

499
00:28:53,980 --> 00:28:54,980
 Is there a process?

500
00:28:54,980 --> 00:28:57,340
 Is there an open process by which, I mean, could we submit one?

501
00:28:57,340 --> 00:28:58,340
 Yeah.

502
00:28:58,340 --> 00:28:59,340
 That's what I was thinking.

503
00:28:59,340 --> 00:29:00,340
 Did they accept anything?

504
00:29:00,340 --> 00:29:01,340
 They've...

505
00:29:01,340 --> 00:29:02,340
 That can't be true.

506
00:29:02,340 --> 00:29:04,320
 I thought that they would commission a cool art.

507
00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:06,820
 It can't be like a bake-off.

508
00:29:06,820 --> 00:29:09,420
 The last film, they asked Billie Eilish to do...

509
00:29:09,420 --> 00:29:10,420
 Yeah.

510
00:29:10,420 --> 00:29:11,420
 No, she just got lucky.

511
00:29:11,420 --> 00:29:13,420
 She just happens to have the best what they said in a million.

512
00:29:13,420 --> 00:29:14,420
 Yeah.

513
00:29:14,420 --> 00:29:15,420
 Wow.

514
00:29:15,420 --> 00:29:16,420
 Exactly.

515
00:29:16,420 --> 00:29:17,420
 And hers just happens to be the best one.

516
00:29:17,420 --> 00:29:18,420
 And they listen to them blind as well.

517
00:29:18,420 --> 00:29:19,420
 Yeah.

518
00:29:19,420 --> 00:29:20,420
 They don't, you know, they don't prejudice themselves.

519
00:29:20,420 --> 00:29:21,420
 It's like the voice.

520
00:29:21,420 --> 00:29:22,420
 It's like the voice.

521
00:29:22,420 --> 00:29:23,420
 It could be anyone.

522
00:29:23,420 --> 00:29:24,420
 But I can't be true, Dan.

523
00:29:24,420 --> 00:29:25,420
 It can't be true.

524
00:29:25,420 --> 00:29:27,940
 Because they always pick the trendiest person in the world at the time, don't they?

525
00:29:27,940 --> 00:29:28,940
 No, I mean...

526
00:29:28,940 --> 00:29:31,420
 And Ed Sheeran has consistently been the second trendiest person in the world.

527
00:29:31,420 --> 00:29:33,420
 She just keeps missing it.

528
00:29:33,420 --> 00:29:36,500
 The reason I say it is I know that Radiohead had a rejected Bond song.

529
00:29:36,500 --> 00:29:38,900
 So I'm trying to work back from there.

530
00:29:38,900 --> 00:29:41,540
 And I'm pretty sure Johnny Cash had one as well.

531
00:29:41,540 --> 00:29:43,260
 And I think this is a thing.

532
00:29:43,260 --> 00:29:44,260
 Yeah.

533
00:29:44,260 --> 00:29:45,260
 But I can't say for sure.

534
00:29:45,260 --> 00:29:46,260
 Wow.

535
00:29:46,260 --> 00:29:49,940
 Maybe they asked people to tender for it, rather than anyone being able to send stuff in.

536
00:29:49,940 --> 00:29:50,940
 Oh, yeah.

537
00:29:50,940 --> 00:29:51,940
 I think they sent...

538
00:29:51,940 --> 00:29:53,260
 I think they asked, like, a group of people.

539
00:29:53,260 --> 00:29:54,540
 I don't think it is open.

540
00:29:54,540 --> 00:29:55,540
 Right.

541
00:29:55,540 --> 00:29:56,540
 Yeah.

542
00:29:56,540 --> 00:29:57,540
 It's not quite as open as that.

543
00:29:57,540 --> 00:29:58,540
 Open season.

544
00:29:58,540 --> 00:29:59,540
 Because you'd see...

545
00:29:59,540 --> 00:30:00,540
 There'd be a thing every three years, wouldn't there?

546
00:30:00,540 --> 00:30:01,540
 Yeah, exactly.

547
00:30:01,540 --> 00:30:04,940
 Have you guys heard of Dusan Sestic?

548
00:30:04,940 --> 00:30:07,940
 He's a composer of the Bosnian National Anthem.

549
00:30:07,940 --> 00:30:09,580
 We spoke about Bosnia earlier.

550
00:30:09,580 --> 00:30:14,700
 He entered the competition to do the Bosnian National Anthem.

551
00:30:14,700 --> 00:30:15,860
 He did really want to win.

552
00:30:15,860 --> 00:30:18,180
 He just wanted to get, like, second or third place.

553
00:30:18,180 --> 00:30:19,380
 There was money for it.

554
00:30:19,380 --> 00:30:21,900
 He, like, was quite into the old Yugoslavia.

555
00:30:21,900 --> 00:30:23,860
 He didn't really care about the new Bosnia.

556
00:30:23,860 --> 00:30:27,180
 But he thought, "I'll get some money out of it because I'm a decent composer."

557
00:30:27,180 --> 00:30:31,820
 Anyway, he won and he wrote the National Anthem for Bosnia.

558
00:30:31,820 --> 00:30:36,620
 And then, in 2009, someone noticed that it was remarkably similar to the theme tune of

559
00:30:36,620 --> 00:30:40,900
 National Lampoon's Animal House, the 1978 movie.

560
00:30:40,900 --> 00:30:41,900
 Right.

561
00:30:41,900 --> 00:30:45,700
 And when you listen to the both, they are almost identical.

562
00:30:45,700 --> 00:30:48,260
 Like, there is no difference whatsoever.

563
00:30:48,260 --> 00:30:53,140
 But, bless him, he went on TV and they were all like, "Well, how come you made our National

564
00:30:53,140 --> 00:30:54,140
 Lampoon the theme tune?"

565
00:30:54,140 --> 00:30:56,340
 She said, "That's the Lampoon's Animal House."

566
00:30:56,340 --> 00:31:00,180
 And he said, "Oh, maybe as a young man, I heard it and it kind of stuck in my head.

567
00:31:00,180 --> 00:31:02,700
 But I didn't deliberately plagiarise it.

568
00:31:02,700 --> 00:31:03,700
 It just so happened."

569
00:31:03,700 --> 00:31:04,700
 That is brilliant.

570
00:31:04,700 --> 00:31:05,700
 Yeah.

571
00:31:05,700 --> 00:31:10,580
 This is the problem with big national policies being decided by right-in contest.

572
00:31:10,580 --> 00:31:14,500
 This is why Canadian legal tender is called the Looney and the Tooney.

573
00:31:14,500 --> 00:31:17,020
 Oh, what?

574
00:31:17,020 --> 00:31:19,820
 The $1 coin has a loon on it, so it's called the Looney.

575
00:31:19,820 --> 00:31:23,860
 And then they had a contest to name the $2 coin, which has a polar bear on it.

576
00:31:23,860 --> 00:31:26,500
 And the winning entry was the Tooney.

577
00:31:26,500 --> 00:31:28,420
 And now that is actually what we call it.

578
00:31:28,420 --> 00:31:32,820
 And it just makes us sound like a joke country.

579
00:31:32,820 --> 00:31:36,700
 Without knowing the other options, Monica, I do think Tooney's quite good.

580
00:31:36,700 --> 00:31:39,460
 I think there's a bit of Bodie McBoatface to it.

581
00:31:39,460 --> 00:31:40,460
 Yeah, yeah.

582
00:31:40,460 --> 00:31:41,460
 We can't speak.

583
00:31:41,460 --> 00:31:42,460
 Haven't they also...

584
00:31:42,460 --> 00:31:43,460
 The Looney and the Tooney.

585
00:31:43,460 --> 00:31:44,460
 Yeah, it works.

586
00:31:44,460 --> 00:31:53,540
 Haven't they recently, just while we're talking about money and having mentioned Star Trek,

587
00:31:53,540 --> 00:31:58,220
 there was the thing where you would spockify your Canadian dollar, right?

588
00:31:58,220 --> 00:32:03,180
 The guy who was on the picture looks so similar to Leonardo Nimoy from Star Trek that you

589
00:32:03,180 --> 00:32:06,020
 would draw spockiers on him and you would draw the hair, basically.

590
00:32:06,020 --> 00:32:07,420
 Yes, it was called spocking.

591
00:32:07,420 --> 00:32:08,420
 Spocking.

592
00:32:08,420 --> 00:32:14,420
 And the Bank of Canada had to issue a statement saying that it was legal to do but inappropriate.

593
00:32:14,420 --> 00:32:21,060
 And I think they've, from what I read, they've changed his image now on the bill.

594
00:32:21,060 --> 00:32:22,060
 Is that right?

595
00:32:22,060 --> 00:32:25,780
 There's a new version of the same guy just so it's less spockable.

596
00:32:25,780 --> 00:32:26,780
 Yeah.

597
00:32:26,780 --> 00:32:31,020
 I think if you draw that spock on any note, then Chee Roddenberry owns half your money.

598
00:32:31,020 --> 00:32:36,180
 Yeah, and then a spock, that was spockspersonic for another agency in Canada, an angel agency

599
00:32:36,180 --> 00:32:40,380
 said to the Bank of Canada, "This is fine as you say it's perfectly legal and I'm sure

600
00:32:40,380 --> 00:32:43,380
 Sir Wilfrid Laurier would get it.

601
00:32:43,380 --> 00:32:46,820
 Who's the man pictured off the bill who died in 1919."

602
00:32:46,820 --> 00:32:53,780
 I've just got one more theme tune I quickly want to bring up, which is The Fresh Prince

603
00:32:53,780 --> 00:32:54,860
 of Bel Air.

604
00:32:54,860 --> 00:32:57,500
 So we all know that theme tune.

605
00:32:57,500 --> 00:33:03,180
 It's a Kraken song by Will Smith and it was a song that he wrote despite not being necessarily

606
00:33:03,180 --> 00:33:04,420
 asked to write it at the time.

607
00:33:04,420 --> 00:33:07,580
 He kind of just did it and he showed it to, I believe it was Quincy Jones who was doing

608
00:33:07,580 --> 00:33:11,060
 the music for the show and they said, "Yeah, you can go and do it."

609
00:33:11,060 --> 00:33:15,580
 Obviously it's a massive hit and when it was released in 1992 as a single, but here's

610
00:33:15,580 --> 00:33:19,740
 the thing, I don't know if James, you bought singles as you were saying back in the day.

611
00:33:19,740 --> 00:33:25,340
 In 1992, The Fresh Prince of Bel Air theme tune was only released exclusively in the Netherlands

612
00:33:25,340 --> 00:33:27,860
 and Spain and that's where it charted.

613
00:33:27,860 --> 00:33:28,860
 That's it.

614
00:33:28,860 --> 00:33:32,340
 That's really, because when you said that, I thought to myself, how come I didn't buy

615
00:33:32,340 --> 00:33:33,340
 that?

616
00:33:33,340 --> 00:33:36,500
 Like I was so sure that I would, if I was around at the time I would have bought it because

617
00:33:36,500 --> 00:33:40,420
 I bought Wicky Wicky Wild Wild West or whatever it was by Will Smith.

618
00:33:40,420 --> 00:33:41,420
 Great song.

619
00:33:41,420 --> 00:33:44,820
 Yeah, I bought all his other crap, so I was really surprised.

620
00:33:44,820 --> 00:33:47,620
 James, did you buy Willenium?

621
00:33:47,620 --> 00:33:48,620
 That was a great album.

622
00:33:48,620 --> 00:33:49,620
 Oh, an album.

623
00:33:49,620 --> 00:33:51,180
 No, I was more of a singles buyer really.

624
00:33:51,180 --> 00:33:54,180
 It's not a good album then.

625
00:33:54,180 --> 00:34:00,700
 I'm sorry, I think enough time has passed that I'm able to have a pop at Willenium.

626
00:34:00,700 --> 00:34:07,180
 What's the name of that album out of your dash?

627
00:34:07,180 --> 00:34:13,460
 Okay, it is time for fact number three and that is my fact.

628
00:34:13,460 --> 00:34:19,660
 My fact this week is that in 2024, the first ever theater production of Dracula will celebrate

629
00:34:19,660 --> 00:34:21,940
 its hundredth anniversary.

630
00:34:21,940 --> 00:34:26,420
 Unfortunately, fans can't celebrate it in the venue it was performed in because it's

631
00:34:26,420 --> 00:34:33,620
 currently occupied by an over 18s adult themed crazy golf course called the House of Holes.

632
00:34:33,620 --> 00:34:36,620
 Filthy.

633
00:34:36,620 --> 00:34:43,220
 This is in Darby, a city in the UK and I was there recently on the weekend for a game of

634
00:34:43,220 --> 00:34:44,220
 bitty golf.

635
00:34:44,220 --> 00:34:47,620
 How was your quick round?

636
00:34:47,620 --> 00:34:52,860
 I was there doing a ghost story festival and afterwards I was hanging out with this really

637
00:34:52,860 --> 00:34:56,380
 cool guy called Chris Horton and he said I've got a fish fact for you.

638
00:34:56,380 --> 00:35:01,140
 And he told me he'd passed the House of Holes and made him laugh and so yeah, so it is a

639
00:35:01,140 --> 00:35:04,460
 very well known theater as well as called the Grand Theater.

640
00:35:04,460 --> 00:35:08,700
 Then it just got repurposed over the years to be something new and there was restaurants

641
00:35:08,700 --> 00:35:13,580
 in its place and so on and now there is this amazing crazy golf.

642
00:35:13,580 --> 00:35:14,740
 The House of Holes.

643
00:35:14,740 --> 00:35:15,740
 Yeah.

644
00:35:15,740 --> 00:35:19,860
 Can I just, I'm sure we'll talk more about crazy or can I talk specifically about the

645
00:35:19,860 --> 00:35:21,380
 House of Holes and Darby.

646
00:35:21,380 --> 00:35:22,380
 Yeah, sure.

647
00:35:22,380 --> 00:35:24,340
 I don't mean to cast any experts on it.

648
00:35:24,340 --> 00:35:25,860
 I don't think it's terribly erotic.

649
00:35:25,860 --> 00:35:26,860
 It doesn't seem to be from the website.

650
00:35:26,860 --> 00:35:27,860
 Oh, really?

651
00:35:27,860 --> 00:35:29,260
 It seems like a lot of it just seems to be novelty.

652
00:35:29,260 --> 00:35:32,740
 Because I think that people at home, some people at home will have an image in their

653
00:35:32,740 --> 00:35:35,300
 heads of what it is.

654
00:35:35,300 --> 00:35:36,300
 Yeah.

655
00:35:36,300 --> 00:35:38,900
 But let's sort of give context then through images.

656
00:35:38,900 --> 00:35:44,140
 One of the holes, you have to hit the ball through a bunch of standing dildos for example.

657
00:35:44,140 --> 00:35:46,540
 Yes, I'm not saying it's totally erotic.

658
00:35:46,540 --> 00:35:52,660
 There's another one where for some reason there's a lot of blow-up dolls that are uninflated

659
00:35:52,660 --> 00:35:57,420
 hanging on washing lines, just hanging in the vicinity of the hole itself.

660
00:35:57,420 --> 00:36:01,660
 Yeah, the area where you play pool, because you know these places, indoor places have

661
00:36:01,660 --> 00:36:03,300
 like, you can play arcades and stuff.

662
00:36:03,300 --> 00:36:07,020
 The area where you play pool is called anal butt.

663
00:36:07,020 --> 00:36:08,020
 What?

664
00:36:08,020 --> 00:36:14,260
 Yeah, and anal has a four instead of the second A in anal, so AN4L butt.

665
00:36:14,260 --> 00:36:16,260
 Well, it's not got to do with pool.

666
00:36:16,260 --> 00:36:17,260
 What does that mean?

667
00:36:17,260 --> 00:36:18,260
 Not quite sure.

668
00:36:18,260 --> 00:36:19,260
 I couldn't get to the bottom of that one.

669
00:36:19,260 --> 00:36:20,260
 But it's there.

670
00:36:20,260 --> 00:36:26,220
 Surely the phrase anal and butt are sort of achieving the same, feeling a little redundant

671
00:36:26,220 --> 00:36:27,220
 to me personally.

672
00:36:27,220 --> 00:36:30,100
 It's definitely a redundant adjective, isn't it?

673
00:36:30,100 --> 00:36:33,540
 How's your butt, well, it's very anal.

674
00:36:33,540 --> 00:36:38,780
 But I don't know what's in the water in Derby, but there was a newspaper piece a couple of

675
00:36:38,780 --> 00:36:39,780
 months ago.

676
00:36:39,780 --> 00:36:45,660
 Derby is now about to get its second erotic mini golf venue.

677
00:36:45,660 --> 00:36:46,900
 It's really popular.

678
00:36:46,900 --> 00:36:56,340
 The new glory holes golf venue will apparently include risque items and decor and some Derby

679
00:36:56,340 --> 00:36:57,540
 themed holes as well.

680
00:36:57,540 --> 00:36:58,540
 So that's nice.

681
00:36:58,540 --> 00:36:59,540
 That's cool.

682
00:36:59,540 --> 00:37:00,540
 That's good.

683
00:37:00,540 --> 00:37:03,860
 Can I quickly, just because let's give this fact just a tiny bit of substance before we

684
00:37:03,860 --> 00:37:09,780
 get into erotic golf, I just want to quickly say that the production just for context was

685
00:37:09,780 --> 00:37:15,180
 the first ever Dracula production and it was put on in the early 1920s and it was a show

686
00:37:15,180 --> 00:37:21,260
 that was sanctioned and approved by Florence Stoker, who was the widow of Bram Stoker.

687
00:37:21,260 --> 00:37:25,220
 And this was the production that became the sort of official theater production that as

688
00:37:25,220 --> 00:37:31,980
 it traveled around the UK and then went international, cast in its lead, Bella Lagosi, who became,

689
00:37:31,980 --> 00:37:34,540
 as we all know, the iconic Dracula in film.

690
00:37:34,540 --> 00:37:41,140
 And weirdly, the final performance that Bella Lagosi ever did as Dracula on stage was back

691
00:37:41,140 --> 00:37:47,020
 in Derby at another theater just around the corner from the ground some 20-odd years later.

692
00:37:47,020 --> 00:37:52,620
 So Derby does have a real Dracula connection as a result of this, very interesting.

693
00:37:52,620 --> 00:37:57,180
 And Lagosi, so he got the role in 1927 when the play moved to the USA.

694
00:37:57,180 --> 00:37:58,700
 That's when Lagosi entered the scene.

695
00:37:58,700 --> 00:38:03,820
 And then in the fifties, it was when he toured again and came back to Derby and did a big

696
00:38:03,820 --> 00:38:05,500
 English tour of this show.

697
00:38:05,500 --> 00:38:08,340
 And he got really upset because apparently the audiences were laughing sometimes because

698
00:38:08,340 --> 00:38:10,060
 Dracula was no longer the big scary thing.

699
00:38:10,060 --> 00:38:14,900
 It had been, it was the early fifties, you know, people have been through a bit since

700
00:38:14,900 --> 00:38:15,900
 the time t's.

701
00:38:15,900 --> 00:38:21,660
 They, they're not as scared and yeah, it seems to have prompted the end of his career, which

702
00:38:21,660 --> 00:38:22,660
 is very sad.

703
00:38:22,660 --> 00:38:26,340
 And it was also this play was also very important for the image of Dracula, the guy who wrote

704
00:38:26,340 --> 00:38:28,420
 it, a guy called Hamilton Dean.

705
00:38:28,420 --> 00:38:34,780
 He made Dracula appear as that more modern suave sort of coat wearing cocktail drinking

706
00:38:34,780 --> 00:38:40,860
 kind of character rather than Brams just all out vampire chaos energy zombie like sir.

707
00:38:40,860 --> 00:38:43,020
 Does it, he drink cocktails?

708
00:38:43,020 --> 00:38:44,020
 Does he?

709
00:38:44,020 --> 00:38:46,140
 Is it passion fruit martini?

710
00:38:46,140 --> 00:38:47,700
 Sorry, he does.

711
00:38:47,700 --> 00:38:52,700
 There was actually one earlier theater production of Dracula, which came out eight days before

712
00:38:52,700 --> 00:38:54,560
 the novel came out.

713
00:38:54,560 --> 00:38:59,620
 This was if you did a novel, someone else could make a play of it and there's not much

714
00:38:59,620 --> 00:39:03,660
 you can do about it unless you put on your own play.

715
00:39:03,660 --> 00:39:10,880
 And so what Bram Stoker did was he had a dramatic reading of his book on stage.

716
00:39:10,880 --> 00:39:13,820
 They had to have it open for the paying public.

717
00:39:13,820 --> 00:39:20,580
 So they would put bills up half an hour before it started saying Dracula on in half an hour

718
00:39:20,580 --> 00:39:26,420
 add two people bought tickets for it and sat in the audience while a couple of actors sort

719
00:39:26,420 --> 00:39:28,580
 of just read through the book.

720
00:39:28,580 --> 00:39:32,380
 And from them doing that, it meant that no one else could play on because he owed copyright

721
00:39:32,380 --> 00:39:33,820
 on the theater production.

722
00:39:33,820 --> 00:39:34,820
 How amazing.

723
00:39:34,820 --> 00:39:35,820
 Yeah.

724
00:39:35,820 --> 00:39:36,820
 Monica, have you done that with really good actually?

725
00:39:36,820 --> 00:39:40,900
 I should do to stop someone doing a bootleg play.

726
00:39:40,900 --> 00:39:46,620
 That's basically what my experience of doing the Edinburgh fringe was going out half an

727
00:39:46,620 --> 00:39:53,620
 hour before the show being like somebody and then you know, mildly entertaining two people.

728
00:39:53,620 --> 00:39:57,100
 Chills, actual chills remembering that everyone's Edinburgh.

729
00:39:57,100 --> 00:39:58,100
 Yeah.

730
00:39:58,100 --> 00:39:59,100
 Okay, Dan.

731
00:39:59,100 --> 00:40:00,100
 We've done the Dracula thing.

732
00:40:00,100 --> 00:40:01,100
 Can we go back to the erotic?

733
00:40:01,100 --> 00:40:02,100
 Mini golf.

734
00:40:02,100 --> 00:40:03,100
 Let's do it.

735
00:40:03,100 --> 00:40:07,620
 I just remembered when you were talking about that that I have played not played golf, but

736
00:40:07,620 --> 00:40:14,460
 I've used a golf club shaped like a penis at the penis museum in Reykjavik.

737
00:40:14,460 --> 00:40:18,980
 They have one and you can sort of pick it up and play with it.

738
00:40:18,980 --> 00:40:24,100
 And yeah, it's like it's just the head part of the golf club is shaped like a penis.

739
00:40:24,100 --> 00:40:26,420
 But it's not it's not for a serious golfer, right?

740
00:40:26,420 --> 00:40:30,260
 As in it's not built for proper play, you know, master's conditions.

741
00:40:30,260 --> 00:40:35,260
 I don't think it adheres to the official USPGA rules.

742
00:40:35,260 --> 00:40:36,860
 It's like a walking stick full of bagels.

743
00:40:36,860 --> 00:40:42,060
 You're not going to use it as an actual assist as a walking stick.

744
00:40:42,060 --> 00:40:48,220
 I think there's a link between the original boom in crazy golf and the current Derby based

745
00:40:48,220 --> 00:40:50,140
 boom in erotic golf.

746
00:40:50,140 --> 00:40:51,140
 Okay.

747
00:40:51,140 --> 00:40:52,860
 So when was the original boom?

748
00:40:52,860 --> 00:40:55,180
 Twenties and thirties.

749
00:40:55,180 --> 00:40:58,820
 Some some lots of sources say that it completely went out when the Great Depression happened.

750
00:40:58,820 --> 00:41:05,020
 But actually, it didn't really it actually boomed during the early thirties.

751
00:41:05,020 --> 00:41:09,740
 During that period, apparently the USA built 25,000 mini golf courses.

752
00:41:09,740 --> 00:41:14,020
 It was described as a devastating craze in the times in 1930.

753
00:41:14,020 --> 00:41:17,740
 And I think the theory behind it is that property value had collapsed and the value of lots

754
00:41:17,740 --> 00:41:21,660
 of things have collapsed and people started their own tiny businesses to generate small

755
00:41:21,660 --> 00:41:23,300
 amounts of income.

756
00:41:23,300 --> 00:41:27,220
 You know, it doesn't have to be anything huge, but it's it's a small local thing on

757
00:41:27,220 --> 00:41:30,580
 whatever kind of waste ground or land you've got.

758
00:41:30,580 --> 00:41:34,420
 You know, some restaurants turned it half the restaurant became a mini golf course and

759
00:41:34,420 --> 00:41:36,100
 the rest of it stayed a restaurant.

760
00:41:36,100 --> 00:41:39,320
 So maybe times of financial hardship when you get a lot more mini golf because you get

761
00:41:39,320 --> 00:41:41,300
 shops that are closed or empty.

762
00:41:41,300 --> 00:41:45,580
 So the new glory hole golf is the site of the old gap store in Derby.

763
00:41:45,580 --> 00:41:47,700
 You know, you've got retail space available.

764
00:41:47,700 --> 00:41:48,700
 What is a glory hole?

765
00:41:48,700 --> 00:41:49,700
 I've got a gap.

766
00:41:49,700 --> 00:41:54,020
 So no, that's my economic theory.

767
00:41:54,020 --> 00:41:56,140
 No, it's a really, yeah, it's a really good theory.

768
00:41:56,140 --> 00:41:59,620
 It's almost a thesis rather than a podcast, isn't it?

769
00:41:59,620 --> 00:42:01,460
 Mini golf doesn't use golf balls.

770
00:42:01,460 --> 00:42:04,460
 Yes, they do.

771
00:42:04,460 --> 00:42:09,100
 There are there are special mini golf balls.

772
00:42:09,100 --> 00:42:10,100
 They're kind of more rubbery.

773
00:42:10,100 --> 00:42:11,100
 They're more rubbery.

774
00:42:11,100 --> 00:42:12,100
 They bounce more.

775
00:42:12,100 --> 00:42:14,900
 And there's a stand that I find this mad.

776
00:42:14,900 --> 00:42:16,380
 There's the world crazy golf championships.

777
00:42:16,380 --> 00:42:19,100
 I mean, there are a few world crazy golf championships.

778
00:42:19,100 --> 00:42:23,020
 One is in Hastings and normally apparently they only get about three overseas players

779
00:42:23,020 --> 00:42:24,020
 each year.

780
00:42:24,020 --> 00:42:29,900
 So the extent to which this world is a bit debatable, but they don't tell you at the

781
00:42:29,900 --> 00:42:34,620
 world crazy golf championships what the ball is until the day before it starts.

782
00:42:34,620 --> 00:42:37,260
 Okay, but it's always going to be spherical.

783
00:42:37,260 --> 00:42:38,260
 It's always going to be spherical.

784
00:42:38,260 --> 00:42:39,420
 I'm pretty sure about that.

785
00:42:39,420 --> 00:42:43,380
 But then other championships, they will they'll let you play a different ball on every hole.

786
00:42:43,380 --> 00:42:46,260
 And the only rule is that once you've started a hole, you have to play the same ball all

787
00:42:46,260 --> 00:42:47,260
 the way through the end.

788
00:42:47,260 --> 00:42:48,260
 Like normal golf.

789
00:42:48,260 --> 00:42:49,260
 Is that true?

790
00:42:49,260 --> 00:42:50,260
 How about local?

791
00:42:50,260 --> 00:42:51,260
 Or mini golf?

792
00:42:51,260 --> 00:42:53,820
 Like we play in Narrabean in Australia.

793
00:42:53,820 --> 00:42:55,420
 They're using special balls.

794
00:42:55,420 --> 00:42:58,700
 I think they'll be more rubbery for sure if you check them.

795
00:42:58,700 --> 00:42:59,700
 Yeah.

796
00:42:59,700 --> 00:43:03,020
 Who would have thought this would be the fact that blew my mind most in this whole round

797
00:43:03,020 --> 00:43:05,220
 of nine years golf again.

798
00:43:05,220 --> 00:43:07,060
 I'm going.

799
00:43:07,060 --> 00:43:11,420
 This is I'm afraid it's back to the it's back to a tangent from the original erotic

800
00:43:11,420 --> 00:43:12,420
 mini golf thing.

801
00:43:12,420 --> 00:43:13,420
 Oh yeah.

802
00:43:13,420 --> 00:43:16,460
 Just that it was on, you know, this new place opening up is going to be called glory holes

803
00:43:16,460 --> 00:43:17,460
 golf.

804
00:43:17,460 --> 00:43:22,420
 And we got an email in the fish and box recently subject line Gibbon glory hole action.

805
00:43:22,420 --> 00:43:23,420
 Oh my God.

806
00:43:23,420 --> 00:43:24,420
 I know this story.

807
00:43:24,420 --> 00:43:25,420
 This is incredible.

808
00:43:25,420 --> 00:43:29,820
 This is a Gibbon in a zoo or a sanctuary.

809
00:43:29,820 --> 00:43:34,660
 This is a female Gibbon and she was living on her own and she got pregnant and it

810
00:43:34,660 --> 00:43:39,820
 was it was basically a virgin birth and it was it was so exciting for the scientists.

811
00:43:39,820 --> 00:43:40,820
 They thought I can't believe this.

812
00:43:40,820 --> 00:43:44,620
 Anyway, they did a bit of an investigation and it turned out obviously it was not a virgin

813
00:43:44,620 --> 00:43:45,620
 birth.

814
00:43:45,620 --> 00:43:51,700
 In between her enclosure and the next door neighbor male Gibbons enclosure was a nine

815
00:43:51,700 --> 00:43:59,180
 millimeter hole through which they had managed to successfully breed and become parents.

816
00:43:59,180 --> 00:44:00,180
 Nine.

817
00:44:00,180 --> 00:44:04,580
 They were just sort of both mushing up against the wall.

818
00:44:04,580 --> 00:44:06,140
 I'm afraid so.

819
00:44:06,140 --> 00:44:07,140
 Life finds a way.

820
00:44:07,140 --> 00:44:08,140
 Yes.

821
00:44:08,140 --> 00:44:09,140
 Wow.

822
00:44:09,140 --> 00:44:11,700
 That's a scene I don't want to see in Jurassic Park.

823
00:44:11,700 --> 00:44:15,220
 I would like to hear David Attenborough do one of his little jokes.

824
00:44:15,220 --> 00:44:19,740
 You know when he sort of makes the animals a fool or he's like our nest is as good a

825
00:44:19,740 --> 00:44:21,700
 place as any.

826
00:44:21,700 --> 00:44:31,660
 Okay, it's time for our final fact of the show and that is James.

827
00:44:31,660 --> 00:44:36,740
 Okay, my fact this week is that in twenty nine and eight to the Canadian Prime Minister

828
00:44:36,740 --> 00:44:42,380
 called ten Downing Street to offer condolences for the death of Margaret Thatcher.

829
00:44:42,380 --> 00:44:44,060
 In fact, she wasn't dead.

830
00:44:44,060 --> 00:44:48,580
 It was a misunderstanding due to the death of the Canadian Transport Minister's cat

831
00:44:48,580 --> 00:44:50,260
 who was also called Thatcher.

832
00:44:50,260 --> 00:44:51,260
 Superb.

833
00:44:51,260 --> 00:44:52,260
 Yeah.

834
00:44:52,260 --> 00:44:53,260
 Really good.

835
00:44:53,260 --> 00:44:54,260
 What a cool.

836
00:44:54,260 --> 00:44:55,260
 What a cool.

837
00:44:55,260 --> 00:44:56,260
 Flying the wall at that cool.

838
00:44:56,260 --> 00:44:57,260
 Yeah.

839
00:44:57,260 --> 00:44:58,260
 A muggy, not a Maggie.

840
00:44:58,260 --> 00:44:59,260
 Oh, brilliant.

841
00:44:59,260 --> 00:45:00,260
 Brilliant.

842
00:45:00,260 --> 00:45:01,260
 Was that you Dan?

843
00:45:01,260 --> 00:45:02,260
 Someone else?

844
00:45:02,260 --> 00:45:03,260
 No, no, no.

845
00:45:03,260 --> 00:45:04,260
 That's the headline of the Guardian article.

846
00:45:04,260 --> 00:45:05,260
 That's wrong.

847
00:45:05,260 --> 00:45:06,260
 Amazing.

848
00:45:06,260 --> 00:45:08,780
 It was a black tie dinner in Toronto.

849
00:45:08,780 --> 00:45:14,100
 Two thousand Canadian Conservatives were there and many of them got a text message saying

850
00:45:14,100 --> 00:45:21,620
 simply Thatcher has died and Demetri Seedas, who was the aide to the Prime Minister, who

851
00:45:21,620 --> 00:45:26,780
 was Stephen Harper at the time, he was sent to ride a letter of condolence and he ran

852
00:45:26,780 --> 00:45:31,100
 Buckingham Palace in Ten Downing Street to kind of work out what they should say and

853
00:45:31,100 --> 00:45:36,060
 you know, and offer condolences as well and then he found out that they hadn't died and

854
00:45:36,060 --> 00:45:42,620
 it turned out that Transport Minister John Baird had a 16 year old grey cat called Thatcher

855
00:45:42,620 --> 00:45:48,740
 and sadly that cat had died but he denied sending the text later on but there definitely

856
00:45:48,740 --> 00:45:52,700
 was a text that was sent to all these people about the cat.

857
00:45:52,700 --> 00:45:57,460
 This is like international incident version of David's dead on Big Brezwick.

858
00:45:57,460 --> 00:45:58,460
 Yes.

859
00:45:58,460 --> 00:46:02,900
 That's the greatest TV moment ever.

860
00:46:02,900 --> 00:46:04,420
 There was a famous David who died.

861
00:46:04,420 --> 00:46:05,420
 David Bowie.

862
00:46:05,420 --> 00:46:06,420
 Yeah.

863
00:46:06,420 --> 00:46:10,460
 Did someone in the building know who, I don't know why I'm telling this story, everyone

864
00:46:10,460 --> 00:46:11,460
 knows it better than me apparently.

865
00:46:11,460 --> 00:46:12,460
 Monica, you can tell it.

866
00:46:12,460 --> 00:46:13,460
 No, no, no.

867
00:46:13,460 --> 00:46:14,460
 Please, you tell it.

868
00:46:14,460 --> 00:46:15,460
 I've actually only seen the clip.

869
00:46:15,460 --> 00:46:19,620
 Okay, so in the Big Brother household that year was Angie Bowie, the first wife of David

870
00:46:19,620 --> 00:46:25,660
 Bowie and also in the house that year was David Guest, who was Liza Minnelli's ex-husband.

871
00:46:25,660 --> 00:46:26,660
 Right.

872
00:46:26,660 --> 00:46:30,380
 Angie gets called in while David Guest is having a sleep in his bed.

873
00:46:30,380 --> 00:46:34,820
 Everyone knows he's having a sleep so he's not around and she gets told that David Bowie

874
00:46:34,820 --> 00:46:41,260
 has died, so she is obviously, she didn't like her ex-husband, but she's also very distressed

875
00:46:41,260 --> 00:46:42,580
 because he was a huge part of her life.

876
00:46:42,580 --> 00:46:46,380
 She comes out, she's trying to keep it secret, and one of the other Americans who's staying

877
00:46:46,380 --> 00:46:49,260
 in the house comes up and says, "Are you okay?"

878
00:46:49,260 --> 00:46:52,880
 And she says, "You can't tell anyone, but David's dead."

879
00:46:52,880 --> 00:46:56,900
 And this other woman immediately freaks out because she thinks it's David Guest who's

880
00:46:56,900 --> 00:46:59,540
 died, but Angie hasn't made the connection.

881
00:46:59,540 --> 00:47:02,060
 So Angie's kind of going, "God, I didn't think you were that big a Bowie fan.

882
00:47:02,060 --> 00:47:07,260
 I can't see how this has erupted, and it causes chaos in the house for five minutes.

883
00:47:07,260 --> 00:47:08,780
 It's TV at its finest."

884
00:47:08,780 --> 00:47:11,940
 Well, imagine that, but with 2,000 Canadian conservatives.

885
00:47:11,940 --> 00:47:12,940
 Yeah.

886
00:47:12,940 --> 00:47:14,900
 What a scene it must have been.

887
00:47:14,900 --> 00:47:16,620
 The true patriot love tribute dinner.

888
00:47:16,620 --> 00:47:17,620
 Oh, is that what it was?

889
00:47:17,620 --> 00:47:18,620
 That's what it was called.

890
00:47:18,620 --> 00:47:22,860
 Military family's honoring thing, but Canadian politics moniker is fabulous.

891
00:47:22,860 --> 00:47:24,860
 Who's doing it?

892
00:47:24,860 --> 00:47:29,300
 Well, I feel like there is, I feel like there is a list of political scandals in Canada

893
00:47:29,300 --> 00:47:36,860
 on Wikipedia and some of them are pretty dry, like the usual grift or bribery or slightly

894
00:47:36,860 --> 00:47:37,860
 dodgy dealings.

895
00:47:37,860 --> 00:47:39,900
 But there are some fun ones.

896
00:47:39,900 --> 00:47:42,540
 Tunergate might be my favorite.

897
00:47:42,540 --> 00:47:43,540
 Tunergate.

898
00:47:43,540 --> 00:47:45,860
 Were you involved in Tunergate, Monica?

899
00:47:45,860 --> 00:47:48,620
 Not to my knowledge, but I'll never admit it if so.

900
00:47:48,620 --> 00:47:50,220
 You'll never catch me.

901
00:47:50,220 --> 00:47:51,220
 Sorry.

902
00:47:51,220 --> 00:47:54,380
 Tunergate, actually think about it now, Tunergate is way too long ago.

903
00:47:54,380 --> 00:47:55,380
 You're clear.

904
00:47:55,380 --> 00:47:56,380
 You're clear.

905
00:47:56,380 --> 00:47:57,380
 You're clear.

906
00:47:57,380 --> 00:47:59,540
 I'm a Canadian cans of decomposing tuna.

907
00:47:59,540 --> 00:48:01,820
 Oh, that was the central problem, right?

908
00:48:01,820 --> 00:48:05,740
 And it wasn't really, really, really unsafe, but it had started to go off before it was

909
00:48:05,740 --> 00:48:06,740
 put in the cans.

910
00:48:06,740 --> 00:48:10,620
 The firm involved was called Starkis and they said, "No, you just, these inspectors, they

911
00:48:10,620 --> 00:48:12,020
 just don't like fish.

912
00:48:12,020 --> 00:48:13,020
 That's their problem."

913
00:48:13,020 --> 00:48:15,900
 And they said, "And we'll close down our plant and you'll lose all these jobs."

914
00:48:15,900 --> 00:48:18,100
 And you know, and that's when it becomes a political thing.

915
00:48:18,100 --> 00:48:22,060
 Because then the fisheries minister said, "Oh, yeah, it's probably, it's fine.

916
00:48:22,060 --> 00:48:23,900
 Yeah, all this stuff, it's great.

917
00:48:23,900 --> 00:48:25,500
 It's actually good."

918
00:48:25,500 --> 00:48:29,180
 And he got a panel together, just like, "Look, can you just assess this tuna, please?"

919
00:48:29,180 --> 00:48:31,660
 And they said, "Yeah, this is rotting tuna in these cans."

920
00:48:31,660 --> 00:48:34,220
 And he says, "Okay, I think we need a different panel."

921
00:48:34,220 --> 00:48:37,500
 And he got a different panel together who eventually said, "Yes, these million tons

922
00:48:37,500 --> 00:48:39,460
 of rotting tuna are fine."

923
00:48:39,460 --> 00:48:40,460
 And then he resigned.

924
00:48:40,460 --> 00:48:41,460
 Yeah.

925
00:48:41,460 --> 00:48:42,940
 And I don't think much of the tuna was eaten in the end.

926
00:48:42,940 --> 00:48:44,460
 And then the firm went bust anyway.

927
00:48:44,460 --> 00:48:49,060
 So that's a very classic Canadian scandal where it's like, it threatened to really kick off

928
00:48:49,060 --> 00:48:55,780
 and ultimately they just, nobody really consumed the tuna and it was sort of fine.

929
00:48:55,780 --> 00:48:59,580
 That's like the other great Canadian political scandal, the Fuddleduddle incident.

930
00:48:59,580 --> 00:49:00,580
 What's this?

931
00:49:00,580 --> 00:49:06,380
 The Fuddleduddle incident in 1971 happened to the first Prime Minister Trudeau, our current

932
00:49:06,380 --> 00:49:11,940
 Prime Minister's father, who was accused of having spoken or at least mouthed unparliamentary

933
00:49:11,940 --> 00:49:13,980
 language in the House of Commons.

934
00:49:13,980 --> 00:49:18,620
 He seemed to have been caught mouthing the words "fuck off."

935
00:49:18,620 --> 00:49:23,620
 But when pressed by television reporters would only admit having moved his lips, they were

936
00:49:23,620 --> 00:49:25,820
 like, "What were you thinking when you moved your lips?"

937
00:49:25,820 --> 00:49:31,140
 And his response was, "What is the nature of your thoughts when you say Fuddleduddle

938
00:49:31,140 --> 00:49:33,380
 or something like that?"

939
00:49:33,380 --> 00:49:36,100
 Implying that he had said Fuddleduddle instead of "fuck off."

940
00:49:36,100 --> 00:49:37,100
 Right.

941
00:49:37,100 --> 00:49:38,100
 That's good.

942
00:49:38,100 --> 00:49:41,060
 If no one's heard you, you know, you're across the room from them.

943
00:49:41,060 --> 00:49:46,340
 Well, then in 2015, his son actually stated on the record that his dad had not said Fuddleduddle.

944
00:49:46,340 --> 00:49:47,980
 And this is a big scandal.

945
00:49:47,980 --> 00:49:48,980
 Minor scandal.

946
00:49:48,980 --> 00:49:49,980
 But that's sort of the scale.

947
00:49:49,980 --> 00:49:55,060
 It's like someone, that's always the scale, it's always a little bit funny, like someone

948
00:49:55,060 --> 00:49:59,420
 threw a pie in Jean Chrétien's face in the '90s and that was quite a big deal.

949
00:49:59,420 --> 00:50:05,860
 The pies were actually coordinated ongoing assault with Fuddleduddle, entartiste, sewer

950
00:50:05,860 --> 00:50:08,340
 Canadian satirical political group.

951
00:50:08,340 --> 00:50:14,100
 And they even released a hit list of people they wanted to get with pies, including Celine

952
00:50:14,100 --> 00:50:16,540
 Dion and Conrad Black and Chrétien.

953
00:50:16,540 --> 00:50:20,180
 And then they were successful in pieing Chrétien twice.

954
00:50:20,180 --> 00:50:21,180
 Right.

955
00:50:21,180 --> 00:50:22,260
 Oh, that's got to stink.

956
00:50:22,260 --> 00:50:27,300
 The pies, were they the kind of clown pies where it's just custard or is it actual like

957
00:50:27,300 --> 00:50:28,300
 apple pies?

958
00:50:28,300 --> 00:50:29,300
 Cream pies.

959
00:50:29,300 --> 00:50:31,220
 Like, oh, it's just cream pies.

960
00:50:31,220 --> 00:50:35,640
 It may even have been shaving cream or just like what you guys would unfortunately call

961
00:50:35,640 --> 00:50:36,640
 squirty cream.

962
00:50:36,640 --> 00:50:37,640
 Squirty cream.

963
00:50:37,640 --> 00:50:41,340
 It's not a nice thing to say and I'm sorry to say it.

964
00:50:41,340 --> 00:50:46,860
 Speaking of shaving cream, I can't believe we managed to get onto shaving cream.

965
00:50:46,860 --> 00:50:51,940
 William Lyon Mackenzie King, who was Prime Minister of Canada for 22 years.

966
00:50:51,940 --> 00:50:52,940
 My favourite.

967
00:50:52,940 --> 00:50:56,580
 Well, I'm not surprised because he did seances and stuff right then.

968
00:50:56,580 --> 00:51:01,220
 But he also used to see symbols in his shaving cream in the morning, which he thought would

969
00:51:01,220 --> 00:51:02,220
 predict the future.

970
00:51:02,220 --> 00:51:03,220
 Yeah.

971
00:51:03,220 --> 00:51:04,220
 Wow.

972
00:51:04,220 --> 00:51:08,200
 I mean, he was he was Prime Minister for 21 years, which possibly is still the record

973
00:51:08,200 --> 00:51:09,800
 length or anyone to do it.

974
00:51:09,800 --> 00:51:11,280
 He had quite a tragic family life.

975
00:51:11,280 --> 00:51:14,240
 He lost all of his family during the war.

976
00:51:14,240 --> 00:51:19,280
 And so as a result, turned like many people did to spirituality as a thing.

977
00:51:19,280 --> 00:51:23,720
 But what many people didn't realise at the time was he was taking that spirituality into

978
00:51:23,720 --> 00:51:31,000
 the into the office with him as a Prime Minister and getting guidance from the spirits of Leonardo

979
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:34,040
 Da Vinci and his deceased dogs.

980
00:51:34,040 --> 00:51:38,060
 The shaving film thing, he was shaved and then the shaving film would go into the water

981
00:51:38,060 --> 00:51:40,860
 on the in the sink kind of thing.

982
00:51:40,860 --> 00:51:46,300
 And at one stage, he saw a polar bear and an eagle and the polar bear was supposed to

983
00:51:46,300 --> 00:51:50,900
 represent like Russia or Soviet Union, I should say, and the eagle supposed to represent

984
00:51:50,900 --> 00:51:51,900
 America.

985
00:51:51,900 --> 00:51:55,220
 And they were kind of fighting in shaving cream.

986
00:51:55,220 --> 00:52:00,300
 And then a dog appeared in the shaving cream, which he thought symbolised Canada, and then

987
00:52:00,300 --> 00:52:03,860
 it came and helped to push the bear off the eagle.

988
00:52:03,860 --> 00:52:08,040
 And that was kind of him thinking that he what side he needs to be in the Cold War needs

989
00:52:08,040 --> 00:52:09,040
 to be on the other side.

990
00:52:09,040 --> 00:52:12,300
 As if he didn't know what side he should probably be on in the Cold War.

991
00:52:12,300 --> 00:52:16,460
 I think that probably just confirmed his suspicions.

992
00:52:16,460 --> 00:52:20,880
 I do feel like a polar bear would be fairly easy to see in shaving cream.

993
00:52:20,880 --> 00:52:25,160
 Like I'm wondering if the shapes he was seeing were sort of like, you know, I saw a vision

994
00:52:25,160 --> 00:52:29,440
 in my shaving cream of a cloud meeting sort of a fog.

995
00:52:29,440 --> 00:52:30,440
 Yeah.

996
00:52:30,440 --> 00:52:31,440
 Oh my God.

997
00:52:31,440 --> 00:52:32,440
 What a character.

998
00:52:32,440 --> 00:52:33,440
 Yeah, amazing guy.

999
00:52:33,440 --> 00:52:38,140
 So just having a look through the old, the old fish inbox, podcast at qi.com.

1000
00:52:38,140 --> 00:52:40,640
 Really good fact we got in from, from John Ford.

1001
00:52:40,640 --> 00:52:41,640
 So thank you, John.

1002
00:52:41,640 --> 00:52:43,980
 This is something maybe you've done at Monica.

1003
00:52:43,980 --> 00:52:50,260
 It's that Canada flies a new flag over its parliament every single day, every single

1004
00:52:50,260 --> 00:52:57,100
 day there's a new flag, and they give the used one to a Canadian and you can apply to

1005
00:52:57,100 --> 00:52:58,100
 get your own flag.

1006
00:52:58,100 --> 00:53:01,180
 And you think I have done this?

1007
00:53:01,180 --> 00:53:04,720
 Well, guess it's possible.

1008
00:53:04,720 --> 00:53:10,000
 Feel like you haven't anymore.

1009
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:14,080
 I haven't quite, no, but if I said that I have the option, well, you have the option,

1010
00:53:14,080 --> 00:53:16,960
 but unfortunately you won't get the flag.

1011
00:53:16,960 --> 00:53:18,400
 So this is a bad thing.

1012
00:53:18,400 --> 00:53:21,960
 The current waiting time is 100 years.

1013
00:53:21,960 --> 00:53:24,960
 It's more than a century because so many people have applied.

1014
00:53:24,960 --> 00:53:27,360
 So they mentioned this on the website, like it's a totally normal thing.

1015
00:53:27,360 --> 00:53:30,120
 Yeah, they say the current waiting time is more than 100 years.

1016
00:53:30,120 --> 00:53:34,900
 And so you can either log on and make a request, why would you, or you can change your details

1017
00:53:34,900 --> 00:53:38,780
 if you made a request, you know, five years ago and you're moving house now.

1018
00:53:38,780 --> 00:53:39,940
 Just to keep it updated.

1019
00:53:39,940 --> 00:53:41,340
 But why would you do that either?

1020
00:53:41,340 --> 00:53:44,340
 Are you allowed to do it for your next generation?

1021
00:53:44,340 --> 00:53:45,340
 Exactly.

1022
00:53:45,340 --> 00:53:46,340
 Can I go to the descendants?

1023
00:53:46,340 --> 00:53:50,900
 I don't think I'll know any of my hundred year from now descendants well enough to care

1024
00:53:50,900 --> 00:53:53,180
 whether or not they get a flag.

1025
00:53:53,180 --> 00:53:55,780
 It's also like not hard to get.

1026
00:53:55,780 --> 00:53:56,780
 It's not very special.

1027
00:53:56,780 --> 00:53:59,480
 It's only been up over a parliament for one day.

1028
00:53:59,480 --> 00:54:00,480
 Yep.

1029
00:54:00,480 --> 00:54:02,680
 You could just get your own flag.

1030
00:54:02,680 --> 00:54:05,680
 It's the kind of shit I buy in eBay.

1031
00:54:05,680 --> 00:54:08,440
 This is all part of my divorce.

1032
00:54:08,440 --> 00:54:11,340
 That's giving unreasonable behavior to me actually.

1033
00:54:11,340 --> 00:54:19,280
 Have you been reading about William Amos from the Liberal Party in the last few months?

1034
00:54:19,280 --> 00:54:28,060
 Very recently he was on a parliamentary Zoom call and he had to apologize because he said

1035
00:54:28,060 --> 00:54:35,660
 I urinated without realizing I was on camera and the amazing thing was is that the month

1036
00:54:35,660 --> 00:54:41,260
 earlier he'd also been recorded in the nude during the virtual session of the Canadian

1037
00:54:41,260 --> 00:54:42,340
 Parliament.

1038
00:54:42,340 --> 00:54:44,460
 So twice in two months.

1039
00:54:44,460 --> 00:54:50,520
 The first time he'd been out for a jog and he was kind of getting changed while the

1040
00:54:50,520 --> 00:54:53,720
 session was going on and they could see.

1041
00:54:53,720 --> 00:54:54,720
 See it all.

1042
00:54:54,720 --> 00:54:55,720
 Yeah.

1043
00:54:55,720 --> 00:54:56,720
 See the right honorable member.

1044
00:54:56,720 --> 00:54:59,160
 See his loony and his toony.

1045
00:54:59,160 --> 00:55:01,880
 But yeah.

1046
00:55:01,880 --> 00:55:06,880
 I can see myself not falling for that just I can see myself doing that.

1047
00:55:06,880 --> 00:55:07,880
 Twice in a row?

1048
00:55:07,880 --> 00:55:10,360
 You quickly check maybe not twice in a row.

1049
00:55:10,360 --> 00:55:12,720
 I think what's better than this case right?

1050
00:55:12,720 --> 00:55:16,340
 Yeah I would definitely get a post-it for the camera after the first time.

1051
00:55:16,340 --> 00:55:17,340
 Yeah.

1052
00:55:17,340 --> 00:55:18,340
 Would I?

1053
00:55:18,340 --> 00:55:19,340
 I don't know.

1054
00:55:19,340 --> 00:55:20,840
 No you would think I couldn't possibly do that again.

1055
00:55:20,840 --> 00:55:21,840
 That's what you think.

1056
00:55:21,840 --> 00:55:22,840
 That's what you think.

1057
00:55:22,840 --> 00:55:24,740
 Oh my god that was the stupidest day of my life.

1058
00:55:24,740 --> 00:55:28,180
 No more mistakes on that front and then you just go along and you know do you say he was

1059
00:55:28,180 --> 00:55:30,100
 urinating into a cup or something?

1060
00:55:30,100 --> 00:55:31,100
 I don't.

1061
00:55:31,100 --> 00:55:32,100
 I don't know.

1062
00:55:32,100 --> 00:55:35,700
 As far as I can tell because this kind of thing has now happened you know we're pretty

1063
00:55:35,700 --> 00:55:36,700
 deep in the pandemic.

1064
00:55:36,700 --> 00:55:38,100
 It's not happened a number of times.

1065
00:55:38,100 --> 00:55:43,380
 It's been fairly high profile people and it has as far as I'm aware never happened to

1066
00:55:43,380 --> 00:55:44,380
 a woman.

1067
00:55:44,380 --> 00:55:51,280
 It's just men who I don't know haven't thought it through or aren't worried enough.

1068
00:55:51,280 --> 00:55:54,260
 I can't even believe that you're saying that you think this could happen to you.

1069
00:55:54,260 --> 00:55:56,920
 This would never happen to me.

1070
00:55:56,920 --> 00:56:02,440
 There's no world in which I would be like okay I'm doing a work Zoom.

1071
00:56:02,440 --> 00:56:05,000
 I'm going to quickly get fully nude.

1072
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:13,460
 No one has to know.

1073
00:56:13,460 --> 00:56:14,460
 Okay that's it.

1074
00:56:14,460 --> 00:56:15,460

 It is Storming the Charts here.

1091

 As we speak it's been in the Sunday Times Best Sellers list for four weeks.

1092
00:57:11,260 --> 00:57:13,140
 It is an absolute rockin' book.

1093
