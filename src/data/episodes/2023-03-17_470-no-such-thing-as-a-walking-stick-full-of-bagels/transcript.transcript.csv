00:00:00,00:00:06,"Hi everybody, Andy here. Just before we start this week's show, we have two exciting announcements"
00:00:06,00:00:12,to make. The first is about who our special guest is this week. She is a brilliant Canadian
00:00:12,00:00:19,"writer, screenwriter, showrunner, now also a first time author. She is Monica Heisey"
00:00:19,00:00:24,"and her debut novel, Really Good Actually is out within the last few weeks and it is"
00:00:24,00:00:29,unsurprisingly really good actually. It's all about the life and travails of a woman
00:00:29,00:00:34,"who has become a surprisingly young divorcee. It is extremely funny. It's kind of, you"
00:00:34,00:00:39,"know, accidentally snort milk out of your nose funny. It's great. Highly recommended."
00:00:39,00:00:43,So we hope you enjoy the show. Monica was great as you will hear shortly. The second
00:00:43,00:00:48,announcement we have to make is that we are doing a live show of no such thing as a fish.
00:00:48,00:00:53,Very exciting. We are going to be at the Hallowed British Library in London. They are having
00:00:53,00:00:59,"a season all about animals and as part of that, we are doing a show called Fantastic Beasts."
00:00:59,00:01:03,"It's going to be Dan, James, myself and a special guest to be announced. It's going"
00:01:03,00:01:07,"to be on the 21st of April and if you don't live anywhere near the British Library, there"
00:01:07,00:01:14,is also going to be a streamed version of it. So just go to no such thing as a fish.com/live.
00:01:14,00:01:18,You will see there the tickets are available for our British Library show. So check it
00:01:18,00:01:36,"out. Okay, that's it. That's all of the announcements on with the show."
00:01:36,00:01:41,"Hello and welcome to another episode of no such thing as a fish, a weekly podcast coming"
00:01:41,00:01:47,to you from four undisclosed locations in the UK. My name is Dan Schreiber. I am sitting
00:01:47,00:01:52,"here with James Harkin, Andrew Hunter Murray and Monica Heisei. And once again, we have"
00:01:52,00:01:57,gathered around the microphones with our four favorite facts from the last seven days.
00:01:57,00:02:04,"And in a particular order here we go. Starting with fact number one, that is Monica."
00:02:04,00:02:10,"So my fact is that in ancient Hebrew times, men could get a divorce if their wife had"
00:02:10,00:02:14,been alone in a room with another man. And I was really interested in this fact because
00:02:14,00:02:21,my divorce lawyer told me that this may still be true. I couldn't find anything backing
00:02:21,00:02:27,"up, but she basically said if he could prove that a man and a woman had been alone together"
00:02:27,00:02:32,"in a room for more than an hour, it could be reasonably assumed legally that adultery"
00:02:32,00:02:35,had occurred. I think we should just say that we're not all in the same room at the
00:02:35,00:02:42,moment. I think that's very important. No. I think people were a bit desperate because
00:02:42,00:02:48,"it used to be that you could only get divorced for five reasons, one of which was adultery."
00:02:48,00:02:51,And so I think people just could stretch it a bit to prove you really just trying to get
00:02:51,00:02:56,out. The history of what you needed to say or
00:02:56,00:03:00,allege or agree that you had been doing to get divorced is absolutely mad. For a long
00:03:00,00:03:06,time it was only adultery or adultery was the only substantial grounds and then they
00:03:06,00:03:10,introduced other ones a bit later on. But there was one rule where if one of you had
00:03:10,00:03:15,"committed adultery, then your partner could divorce you. But if you both had, they might"
00:03:15,00:03:19,not be able to because legally the divorce was kind of an acknowledgement that one person
00:03:19,00:03:24,had committed wrong with the other was being like an eye for an eye and a shag for a shag.
00:03:24,00:03:30,"Yeah. And if you'd both done it, then you weren't allowed to lie saying, ""Oh, I've committed"
00:03:30,00:03:34,"adulterally."" Sorry, that's a Ned Flanders version of adultery. You weren't allowed to"
00:03:34,00:03:39,"lie saying you'd committed adultery. That's perjury. So they made it very, very difficult."
00:03:39,00:03:45,"Well, that's religion for you. And also it was a very specific definition as well. Adultery"
00:03:45,00:03:52,legally is a married person having full sex with someone of the opposite gender. So if
00:03:52,00:03:56,"your husband had a gay affair and you were a woman, you couldn't sue him for divorce"
00:03:56,00:04:00,"on grounds of adultery, but you could sue him for unreasonable behavior."
00:04:00,00:04:06,"No, really? Yeah. Wow. This thing in the Jewish law, this is from the Mishnah, which is the"
00:04:06,00:04:12,oldest written question of Jewish oral traditions. And the thing is that because if the woman
00:04:12,00:04:18,"had been in a room with another man, in theory, there can't be any other witnesses, right?"
00:04:18,00:04:22,"Because it's basically one person's word against another person's word. And okay, you have"
00:04:22,00:04:25,the perjury thing. But what they would do is they would give you the ordeal of bitter
00:04:25,00:04:31,water. And this was to tell if you were telling the truth or not. So they would give the woman
00:04:31,00:04:37,some water with some dust in it. And it's not really clear what the dust is. It might
00:04:37,00:04:42,"be bits of barley, it might be bits of something else. And the idea is if the woman drinks it"
00:04:42,00:04:47,and the water is so bitter that she has to like spit it out. And then that proves that
00:04:47,00:04:48,she was in the wrong.
00:04:48,00:04:49,"God, it's like witch trials."
00:04:49,00:04:52,"A little bit like that. It's a trial by ordeal though, we can't let it."
00:04:52,00:04:57,I feel like I give myself this test every morning when I try for one sip of the water that's
00:04:57,00:04:59,been out by my bedside table all night.
00:04:59,00:05:05,"I'll tell you, the worst divorce situation I read about in this research was to do with"
00:05:05,00:05:08,if you were divorcing the king of Thailand.
00:05:08,00:05:13,"The problem is that if you go to divorce the king of Thailand, you have to obviously accuse"
00:05:13,00:05:18,"the king of Thailand of reasons for the divorce. Unfortunately, by law in Thailand, you were"
00:05:18,00:05:24,not allowed to accuse the king of anything. So when the current king's divorce case was
00:05:24,00:05:28,"going on, I think he was the crown prince at the time, he went to court and he made"
00:05:28,00:05:33,"all these accusations against the wife. And the wife had to just say, ""Yeah, he was fine."
00:05:33,00:05:38,"Couldn't say anything. Couldn't defend himself."" Yeah. So he obviously won."
00:05:38,00:05:44,"I've got a fact about the king of Thailand. Do you remember the king and I, the play or"
00:05:44,00:05:45,Mee's Coldplay?
00:05:45,00:05:46,Yeah.
00:05:46,00:05:52,It's about someone called Anna Leonowens who went to work for the king of Thailand. And
00:05:52,00:05:58,"the real life Anna Leonowens was the great aunt of Boris Karloff who played, was it"
00:05:58,00:05:59,Frankenstein or?
00:05:59,00:06:00,Yeah.
00:06:00,00:06:03,Yeah. Yeah. It's just a fact.
00:06:03,00:06:09,"It's just two people you wouldn't expect to be related to each other, I reckon."
00:06:09,00:06:14,Yes. Yeah. That's very true. Like Ben Elton and Luke Longley are brothers-in-law. That would
00:06:14,00:06:16,mean nothing to no one except Australians. Yeah.
00:06:16,00:06:19,I've never heard of Luke. Who's Luke Longley?
00:06:19,00:06:23,One of the great Australian basketball players played with the Chicago Bulls in the Michael
00:06:23,00:06:25,Jordan period. He's a legend.
00:06:25,00:06:30,One of the great Australian basketball players. How big is this cohort?
00:06:30,00:06:35,"There's three of them. And one of them is related by marriage, but not blood to Ben Elton."
00:06:35,00:06:36,Amazing.
00:06:36,00:06:39,"Gosh. Why didn't you pick that as your headline fact this week, Darren?"
00:06:39,00:06:43,"I've been pitching it for nine years, you guys. Swatting it away every week. I found"
00:06:43,00:06:48,"a modern divorce story, which I can't believe that this is true, but it was reported in a"
00:06:48,00:06:56,"bunch of places. So this is to do with a Bosnian couple, Sana Klarek and her husband, Adnan."
00:06:56,00:07:03,"And Adnan had not been happy in the marriage, and he started looking around for love and"
00:07:03,00:07:07,he went online. And so he started chatting to someone online. He used a fake name just
00:07:07,00:07:13,"to make sure that no one could clock on to who he was. He met someone. He said, ""I suddenly"
00:07:13,00:07:16,was in love again. It was beautiful. I thought I'd finally found someone who understands
00:07:16,00:07:21,"me and who's in a similar situation in a bad marriage like I am."" So they decided to meet"
00:07:21,00:07:29,up. And they meet up and he sees a city in the spot where his online love should be.
00:07:29,00:07:34,"His wife, who has also gone online, created a pseudonym, looked for love. They found each"
00:07:34,00:07:39,other. And what's remarkable is that is how they found out that each of them were basically
00:07:39,00:07:44,"cheating on each other and divorced off the back of it, despite falling back in love with"
00:07:44,00:07:48,each other in this online scenario. They looked at it as negative.
00:07:48,00:07:52,Reverse Pina Colada song.
00:07:52,00:07:56,"It's like a Richard Curtis film until the last sentence, isn't it?"
00:07:56,00:07:59,Yeah. Yeah. Super plot twist in the end there.
00:07:59,00:08:05,There was a guy in New York. He was from New York anyway. And he divorced his wife in Dominican
00:08:05,00:08:13,Republic and she didn't find out for 22 years. So he filled in the form and got her to sign
00:08:13,00:08:18,something which she didn't know what she was signing. And he got an official divorce and
00:08:18,00:08:23,then she only found out when she got a letter through about the house that they owned and
00:08:23,00:08:26,"her name wasn't on the deeds. And she sort of rang her lawyer and said, ""What's going"
00:08:26,00:08:30,"on?"" And he said, ""Well, it turns out you're not married and you haven't been for 22 years."""
00:08:30,00:08:33,But they can't have been living together.
00:08:33,00:08:34,Yeah.
00:08:34,00:08:35,What?
00:08:35,00:08:38,He just didn't tell her that they weren't married anymore. And what she said in the case
00:08:38,00:08:43,"and I couldn't find out what in the end happened, but she said that she thought that he'd done"
00:08:43,00:08:48,"it deliberately so that he would own everything. If he left her in the future, she wouldn't"
00:08:48,00:08:49,have any rights. That's what she said.
00:08:49,00:08:52,But then he stayed with her for decades?
00:08:52,00:08:56,"Yeah. Because apparently, I mean, I can't really speak for him. But what she said is"
00:08:56,00:09:02,"that the marriage was kind of happy, but he just did it as a kind of backup in case he"
00:09:02,00:09:03,needed it in the future.
00:09:03,00:09:04,Oh my God.
00:09:04,00:09:05,Oh no.
00:09:05,00:09:07,"That's about that, isn't it?"
00:09:07,00:09:13,I became really obsessed with unreasonable behavior as a category. So they changed the
00:09:13,00:09:20,"law in 2022 and now you could have a no fault divorce in the UK, which means that you don't"
00:09:20,00:09:24,have to identify a guilty parting. You can just both agree that you want to dissolve
00:09:24,00:09:28,"your marriage. But prior to that, you had to pick one of these five categories, kind"
00:09:28,00:09:33,of whether or not there was something going on. And unreasonable behavior is such a very
00:09:33,00:09:38,"capacious category. And I think 51% of women filing for divorce in this country, that was"
00:09:38,00:09:44,their grounds. They're only 36% of men. And a lot of it has to do with gaming. People
00:09:44,00:09:48,"were divorcing because either their husbands were gaming too often, but a lot of them like"
00:09:48,00:09:52,"a non-negligible portion, or people who are having digital affairs."
00:09:52,00:09:55,"So you're basically meeting someone via, not by fortnight."
00:09:55,00:10:02,Your Sims avatar is having sex with someone else's Sim.
00:10:02,00:10:07,"So what are the other limits to this, what was it called again?"
00:10:07,00:10:08,Unreasonable behavior.
00:10:08,00:10:09,Unreasonable behavior.
00:10:09,00:10:11,"What are you worried about, Dan?"
00:10:11,00:10:16,"Excessive Ben Elton memorabilia purchases from eBay. Is that, do I need to watch out?"
00:10:16,00:10:23,I do think it's a very bendy category. It basically is like a prolonged commitment to behavior
00:10:23,00:10:29,that is a problem to the marriage. So that can include like actively building a life separate
00:10:29,00:10:35,"to your partner. If you're developing too many not shared interests, or you're really"
00:10:35,00:10:41,"going hard on, I don't know, you have a new hobby and you're going away and pursuing rock"
00:10:41,00:10:45,"climbing all the time, and your partner is no interested in whatsoever. Eventually, after"
00:10:45,00:10:49,"a certain amount of rock climbing, I suppose it can become unreasonable."
00:10:49,00:10:55,I think reckless spending counts as well. If you're spending loads of money on Ben Elton
00:10:55,00:10:56,"memorabilia, Dan."
00:10:56,00:11:01,I'm done. Yeah. Did you guys ever hear of the Brighton Quickie?
00:11:01,00:11:05,This is a divorce practice. And I've done a fair bit of reading about it. I can't quite
00:11:05,00:11:09,"work out how real it was. Basically, in 1923, the law was changed saying you could petition"
00:11:09,00:11:13,on adultery only. It was the only grounds for divorce. And that led to this thing where
00:11:13,00:11:17,it's kind of like Monica's original fact about the being in a room together. You would
00:11:17,00:11:22,"go down, as the husband, you would agree to be the adulterer. You'd book a hotel room"
00:11:22,00:11:26,in Brighton because it's easy on the train from London. You spend the night there with
00:11:26,00:11:31,a woman you don't know. You don't have sex or anything. But there's a hotel receipt saying
00:11:31,00:11:35,you've booked a room for two the next morning. Maybe you're witnessed by the chambermaid.
00:11:35,00:11:37,You could two pairs of shoes outside the door.
00:11:37,00:11:43,Exactly. Exactly. And there's then a small body of evidence that you can use to get your
00:11:43,00:11:44,divorce.
00:11:44,00:11:45,And then Tim's link back.
00:11:45,00:11:50,"Yeah. You haven't even got to commit adultery, but you will be divorced in due course. But"
00:11:50,00:11:54,I just can't tell how much it actually happened if at all. It's in a few novels and it's
00:11:54,00:11:55,written about at the time.
00:11:55,00:11:56,But it's not.
00:11:56,00:12:00,"Also, how important is the chambermaid in this? Are all the rooms in this hotel packed"
00:12:00,00:12:03,with people going for a Brighton quickie? And she's got to sort of be...
00:12:03,00:12:04,She's the witness.
00:12:04,00:12:08,Yeah. She's the witness for like 40 things a day where she has to...
00:12:08,00:12:12,Was that... Yeah. Then I saw the shoes outside that door. And then was it the pancakes?
00:12:12,00:12:17,I took a tea and they were on top of the bed. There was a pillow on the floor. So that's
00:12:17,00:12:18,suggestive.
00:12:18,00:12:22,"I read that in Delaware and Colorado, you can get your marriage annulled if you did"
00:12:22,00:12:30,it for a dare. But none of the other 48 states is that explicitly in the rules. Like probably
00:12:30,00:12:33,you still could get an annullment if you said that but you would have to go into something
00:12:33,00:12:38,"else. But in those two states, it explicitly says it is illegal to get married on a dare."
00:12:38,00:12:41,"I mean, all marriages are kind of a dare."
00:12:41,00:12:42,"Oh, they're?"
00:12:42,00:12:43,Yeah.
00:12:43,00:12:44,That's what a proposal is. It's a big dare.
00:12:44,00:12:48,Yeah. I dare you to stay with me until one or both of us dies.
00:12:48,00:12:50,I bet your wife is wishing she shows truth though.
00:12:50,00:12:52,Yeah. Every day.
00:12:52,00:12:59,"I got a thing which is one of really classic Marvin Gaye albums, which was called Here,"
00:12:59,00:13:04,"My Dear, was made within a divorce proceeding whereby Marvin Gaye didn't quite have the"
00:13:04,00:13:10,alimony that he needed to pay for his child. And so the agreement was the next album that
00:13:10,00:13:15,"you do, your wife, who you're now divorcing, is going to get half of the money, royalties"
00:13:15,00:13:20,"and the upfront money from the album itself. And he decided, well, I don't want her making"
00:13:20,00:13:24,any money. So I'm going to do a quickie album basically. I'm just going to not really do
00:13:24,00:13:28,anything good. It's going to come out and it's just going to be panned by the critics.
00:13:28,00:13:33,No one's going to like it. And then suddenly he got fascinated by the notion of this album
00:13:33,00:13:38,"and ended up putting more heart and soul into this album, possibly than any of his other"
00:13:38,00:13:41,albums. He was really hands on. He wrote the lyrics. He never writes lyrics for his songs
00:13:41,00:13:46,according to the stuff that I was reading. He never really was hands on with playing
00:13:46,00:13:51,"the piano. But in this album, he insisted on doing the lyrics, the piano. And it was"
00:13:51,00:13:55,"panned at the time, but it's been, it's one of those albums that's been reviewed by everyone"
00:13:55,00:14:00,"since, you know, the Rolling Stone has named it one of the best 500 albums ever made three"
00:14:00,00:14:04,"times in lists that they released. And it constantly appears on these lists now, but"
00:14:04,00:14:08,"it was a, it's a pure divorce album. Pretty cool."
00:14:08,00:14:11,"What's the story of the producers, the film the producers done? We've just done, you've"
00:14:11,00:14:15,"given us a fact, which is the song Pina Colada, and now you've given us the film, the producers,"
00:14:15,00:14:17,but you've translated it to being about Marvin Gaye.
00:14:17,00:14:18,"No, no, no."
00:14:18,00:14:20,We see you. We see what you do.
00:14:20,00:14:24,They made it bad. He made this good during the process. The producers was bad.
00:14:24,00:14:29,"I wonder at what point he decided to start making it good. Like if he's like, I'm going"
00:14:29,00:14:34,"to make it so bad. And then what day did he realize, oh, I'm actually very invested."
00:14:34,00:14:35,I'm really trying quite hard now.
00:14:35,00:14:36,Yeah. I don't know.
00:14:36,00:14:39,"I guess if you're an artist, it's going to be really hard to go. I'll just put out a"
00:14:39,00:14:44,"shit album. Like that's, that must be a painful thing to do, to make a decision on."
00:14:44,00:14:49,"I don't know. Some of them managed, don't they? But I think like, I think if he didn't"
00:14:49,00:14:53,"normally play piano and didn't normally write the lyrics, and then he started doing it,"
00:14:53,00:14:57,he must have not normally done it because he didn't think he was as good as the people
00:14:57,00:15:01,"who were doing it, right? Originally. And then when he started doing it, he's like, oh,"
00:15:01,00:15:02,this is pretty good.
00:15:02,00:15:08,It's also a little bit self myth making. I tried to make an album which said I've made
00:15:08,00:15:11,one of the 500 greatest of all time.
00:15:11,00:15:13,"Oh, that's just me."
00:15:13,00:15:22,"Okay, it is time for fact number two. And that is Andy."
00:15:22,00:15:27,"My fact is that the same fingers are responsible for the clicks in the Adams family theme,"
00:15:27,00:15:33,"the bongos in the Mission Impossible theme, and the xylophone in the Simpsons theme. The"
00:15:33,00:15:39,same human fingers created three of the great artworks of the 20th century. I think it's
00:15:39,00:15:41,unbelievable. I think it's so great.
00:15:41,00:15:44,Would you say that you play the xylophone with your fingers?
00:15:44,00:15:45,I was going to question that.
00:15:45,00:15:46,Yeah.
00:15:46,00:15:54,"His name was Woodfingers Richards and he, he was incredible. You know what fingers Richards,"
00:15:54,00:15:59,"when he clicked his fingers for the Adams family, he set himself on fire."
00:15:59,00:16:04,"Emil Richards, he was a hero of percussion. I should say where I got this. It was via"
00:16:04,00:16:08,"a brilliant piece published each year by a guy called Tom Whitwell, which is a 52 things"
00:16:08,00:16:12,"you learn each year. I think I may have mentioned him before, either one or two or three years"
00:16:12,00:16:15,"ago, but anyway, it's a brilliant list. And this is one of the facts. I just couldn't"
00:16:15,00:16:21,"believe it. And Emil Richards, it turns out, born 1932, died 2019 in between those two dates,"
00:16:21,00:16:25,at the most amazing musical career.
00:16:25,00:16:26,Yeah.
00:16:26,00:16:31,He played with Frank Sinatra. He toured with George Harrison. He was one of the most amazing
00:16:31,00:16:34,"session musicians ever. The list of people who played with this just,"
00:16:34,00:16:39,"He played with Charlie Mingus, you know, he was proppered into the scene of jazz and blues"
00:16:39,00:16:43,"and, and then, yeah, as you say, he went on tour and also played on three George Harrison"
00:16:43,00:16:49,albums. He was inducted into the Percussive Arts Society Hall of Fame in 1994. That's
00:16:49,00:16:52,a very hard Hall of Fame to get into.
00:16:52,00:16:55,Is it harder to get into than the Australian Basketball Hall of Fame?
00:16:55,00:16:56,Yes.
00:16:56,00:17:01,"I imagine to get in, you have to do a special knock to get into the Percussive Art of Fame."
00:17:01,00:17:04,"But no, yeah, what an extraordinary guy."
00:17:04,00:17:08,"Yeah, it's amazing. Frank Zafer, Doris Day, The Beach Boys, The Bee Gees, Blondie, Ella"
00:17:08,00:17:13,"Fitzgerald, Marvin Gaye. I don't know if it was on the, the album."
00:17:13,00:17:14,"Oh, imagine."
00:17:14,00:17:17,"What? I think, I think Marvin did all his finger clicks on that album."
00:17:17,00:17:23,"Right, okay. He was just incredible. I love this. His autobiography was called My Life"
00:17:23,00:17:24,Behind Bars.
00:17:24,00:17:25,"Oh, very nice."
00:17:25,00:17:30,"Oh, you may have come across this in the course of your research. Do you, can you guess what"
00:17:30,00:17:33,kind of animal he wanted to come back as in the next life?
00:17:33,00:17:34,"Oh, I didn't see that."
00:17:34,00:17:35,I did not see that.
00:17:35,00:17:38,"Something, something percussive. So, uh..."
00:17:38,00:17:39,Woodpecker.
00:17:39,00:17:42,"Oh, such a good, such a good guess. I wish it was that."
00:17:42,00:17:43,Imagine it's just totally unrelated.
00:17:43,00:17:46,"No, no, no. It is related to his percussionist life."
00:17:46,00:17:47,"Oh, it is."
00:17:47,00:17:48,He had an octopus.
00:17:48,00:17:50,"Oh, so he can have more arms."
00:17:50,00:17:53,"Woodpecker is better, actually, yeah."
00:17:53,00:17:57,Six of them are legs in an octopus.
00:17:57,00:18:00,He had the world's largest collection of percussive instruments.
00:18:00,00:18:01,Really?
00:18:01,00:18:05,"This guy, yeah, he had 700, over 770."
00:18:05,00:18:16,"I don't know if that's 771, maybe, but he, he had an angklung, a bulbul terang, a chimta,"
00:18:16,00:18:23,"a flapamba, a jengu, a mvira, and a pak havaj."
00:18:23,00:18:27,"When I was looking him up, they said he's a, he plays the vibraphone and I went to look"
00:18:27,00:18:31,up what a vibraphone was and the first thing that just said not to be confused with the
00:18:31,00:18:32,vibraphlap.
00:18:32,00:18:35,And what is that?
00:18:35,00:18:36,Always getting them fixed up.
00:18:36,00:18:40,"The vibraphlap is, have you ever seen that instrument? It's like a piece of wire bent"
00:18:40,00:18:43,into a U and there's a wooden ball on the end.
00:18:43,00:18:49,"It hits the box. So that's a vibraphlap and a vibraphone is more, looks like a xylophone."
00:18:49,00:18:51,I don't know how you would confuse them.
00:18:51,00:18:56,They don't look at all alike and they're both so obscure that I feel like it's very unlikely
00:18:56,00:19:00,you'll be talking about one and not know what the other one is like either you're not talking
00:19:00,00:19:06,about these at all or there's no risk of you confusing the two.
00:19:06,00:19:09,So he did the Mission Impossible theme tune.
00:19:09,00:19:14,The bong goes on that and I was looking into the Mission Impossible theme tune generally.
00:19:14,00:19:20,"So there's this fact, which is that the beat of the song was written to the Morse code"
00:19:20,00:19:22,of M and I.
00:19:22,00:19:25,So can you give us the one it goes like for anyone who doesn't.
00:19:25,00:19:26,"Andy, you're a bigger fan."
00:19:26,00:19:28,I always end up doing Bond by accident.
00:19:28,00:19:29,Can you do it quickly?
00:19:29,00:19:33,"Do you mean the bit they go bam, bam, bam, bam, bam, bam, bam, bam, bam, bam, bam."
00:19:33,00:19:34,Yes.
00:19:34,00:19:35,Yeah.
00:19:35,00:19:38,"So it's dash, dash, dot, dot is the thing for it."
00:19:38,00:19:39,Great.
00:19:39,00:19:44,"But the guy who wrote it, Shifrin, he wrote that whole song he says in three minutes."
00:19:44,00:19:45,Wow.
00:19:45,00:19:46,Really?
00:19:46,00:19:47,Yeah.
00:19:47,00:19:50,You often hear that with a few musicians where they say I just banged that out and it just
00:19:50,00:19:54,came to me as a fully formed piece and that happened and that happened with Mission Impossible.
00:19:54,00:19:55,So that's quite cool.
00:19:55,00:19:58,And the same with the James Bond theme.
00:19:58,00:20:03,"That wasn't written in a quick time, but if by a guy called Monty Norman and he actually,"
00:20:03,00:20:08,"which is, I really like this, he was hired by the Bond people to come up specifically"
00:20:08,00:20:09,with this theme.
00:20:09,00:20:15,And they took him out to Jamaica on a holiday and he met Connery out there and Ursula Andres.
00:20:15,00:20:17,Because they were filming Dr. No.
00:20:17,00:20:19,"Yeah, they were filming Dr. No, the first one out there."
00:20:19,00:20:22,And so he was brought to meet them all and get a vibe of it.
00:20:22,00:20:26,And he ended up just using a previous tune that he had written for a completely different
00:20:26,00:20:28,adaption that never got used.
00:20:28,00:20:34,"It was a stage production of VS Naples' novel, A House for Mr. Biswas."
00:20:34,00:20:38,That's the original James Bond theme and it was played on Sitar.
00:20:38,00:20:43,"It's the other one that goes da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, oh, because I know the original"
00:20:43,00:20:48,"lyrics about something like, I was born with an unfortunate sneeze and yes, that's it."
00:20:48,00:20:52,My parents said that I was made the wrong way around.
00:20:52,00:20:54,Oh my God.
00:20:54,00:20:58,This is a bigger repurpose than Candle in the Wind.
00:20:58,00:21:00,This is a big shift.
00:21:00,00:21:01,So strange.
00:21:01,00:21:07,"And I think at the end of the song, he sneezes so much that he falls into a lay cuss of that"
00:21:07,00:21:08,tune.
00:21:08,00:21:09,"Oh, right."
00:21:09,00:21:10,Wow.
00:21:10,00:21:13,"This guy, Monty Norman, he also wrote an autobiography."
00:21:13,00:21:15,So Life Behind Bar is a very good title.
00:21:15,00:21:18,"Do you know, Andy, you look like you might know the title of his autobiography."
00:21:18,00:21:19,"No, I don't."
00:21:19,00:21:20,Is it Musical and James Bond theme?
00:21:20,00:21:21,No.
00:21:21,00:21:22,"Well, I'm not going to get it."
00:21:22,00:21:26,It was called A Walking Stick Full of Bagels.
00:21:26,00:21:27,Okay.
00:21:27,00:21:28,You know that.
00:21:28,00:21:30,"Without knowing the context, that is not a good title for it."
00:21:30,00:21:32,I think that must have been a classic phrase back in the day.
00:21:32,00:21:34,You're like a walking stick full of bagels.
00:21:34,00:21:35,And what does that mean?
00:21:35,00:21:37,How would a stick be full of anything?
00:21:37,00:21:38,There we go.
00:21:38,00:21:39,Yeah.
00:21:39,00:21:40,So many questions.
00:21:40,00:21:43,I bet they were all answered in the unpublished autobiography and we are yet to find out.
00:21:43,00:21:49,"I think the best autobiography title I've ever heard was Tori Spelling's Autobiography,"
00:21:49,00:21:51,Storytelling by Tori Spelling.
00:21:51,00:21:52,Genius.
00:21:52,00:21:53,Really strong title.
00:21:53,00:21:54,I've got it.
00:21:54,00:21:55,I got it off that title.
00:21:55,00:21:58,But that doesn't go down well in the divorce case.
00:21:58,00:21:59,Tori Spelling's Autobiography.
00:21:59,00:22:07,Have you guys heard of the village of Kong Thong in northeast India?
00:22:07,00:22:08,No.
00:22:08,00:22:12,This is a village where every child is given a theme tune.
00:22:12,00:22:13,"Oh, cool."
00:22:13,00:22:14,So it's a little village.
00:22:14,00:22:16,It's really cut off from the rest of India.
00:22:16,00:22:18,I don't think you can get that by car.
00:22:18,00:22:20,I think you can get that by boat.
00:22:20,00:22:26,"It's in the middle of a jungle and people would forage for broom grass, which they would"
00:22:26,00:22:27,sell on.
00:22:27,00:22:31,And so a lot of the time you would spend in the jungle sort of walking around probably
00:22:31,00:22:32,alone.
00:22:32,00:22:36,And the thing is in the jungle is quite hard to hear people for long distances because
00:22:36,00:22:39,it all gets soaked in by the trees.
00:22:39,00:22:43,And so they came up with this different way of telling people you're around by having
00:22:43,00:22:47,a different tune that you would whistle or you would shout or whatever.
00:22:47,00:22:52,"And so when you're born, you get your theme tune and then for the rest of your life, whenever"
00:22:52,00:22:55,"you're in the jungle, people will make this little doodoo doodoo doodoo."
00:22:55,00:22:57,"You'd be like, oh, that's me."
00:22:57,00:22:58,That was the Simpsons.
00:22:58,00:22:59,So cool.
00:22:59,00:23:00,Yeah.
00:23:00,00:23:01,Yeah.
00:23:01,00:23:05,I think lawyers will be in touch with that kid.
00:23:05,00:23:09,He was from the Simpson family of Kong Thong.
00:23:09,00:23:11,"That is so cool, isn't it?"
00:23:11,00:23:12,That's awesome.
00:23:12,00:23:16,"Unfortunately, it's kind of dying out because people now will connect with each other using"
00:23:16,00:23:19,mobile phones so they don't need these theme tunes so much.
00:23:19,00:23:22,"Yes, again, the internet's ruined it all."
00:23:22,00:23:28,I'm having a quick think about songs that use the old Panda Rooze as a kind of iconic
00:23:28,00:23:29,bit of it.
00:23:29,00:23:34,"And obviously, if you're thinking theme tunes, the Friends theme tune, I'll be there for"
00:23:34,00:23:36,you by the Rem Brands.
00:23:36,00:23:38,"There's like a clapping bit, right?"
00:23:38,00:23:39,Yeah.
00:23:39,00:23:40,So it's four claps.
00:23:40,00:23:43,"Apparently, there's a bit of controversy because Courtney Cox did five claps on a TV"
00:23:43,00:23:46,show once and it sent the writers of the song mad.
00:23:46,00:23:51,"But the song, I'll be there for you, it was actually a song composed specifically for"
00:23:51,00:23:55,the TV show and the Rem Brands had very minimal input into the writing itself.
00:23:55,00:24:02,It was the actual creators of Friends who wrote the song and it proved to be such an
00:24:02,00:24:06,iconic theme tune that everyone was begging for it to be released in the...
00:24:06,00:24:09,"Yeah, I bought it in the chance when it came out."
00:24:09,00:24:14,So what that was was they had to go into a studio and write a whole song because there
00:24:14,00:24:15,wasn't a whole song.
00:24:15,00:24:17,It was only the theme tune bit of the song.
00:24:17,00:24:19,They needed two more verses to be added in.
00:24:19,00:24:20,"Oh, really?"
00:24:20,00:24:21,Yeah.
00:24:21,00:24:25,So it was a backwards constructed full song that ended up coming out.
00:24:25,00:24:26,That's so interesting.
00:24:26,00:24:27,So it was 40 seconds long.
00:24:27,00:24:31,There was like a time in the 90s when all the theme tunes used to come out and you could
00:24:31,00:24:35,buy them for the charts like the exfiles did around that time as well.
00:24:35,00:24:39,"And they all did quite well in the charts just because people thought, oh, I like that"
00:24:39,00:24:40,song.
00:24:40,00:24:41,Yeah.
00:24:41,00:24:42,I love...
00:24:42,00:24:43,"I mean, the exfiles is my favorite theme tune of all time."
00:24:43,00:24:44,"And it turns out, so the guy who composed that's called..."
00:24:44,00:24:45,Mark Snow?
00:24:45,00:24:46,"Yeah, Mark Snow."
00:24:46,00:24:49,"And David DeColvany claims, I think this is tongue in cheek."
00:24:49,00:24:53,"I mean, it completely is tongue in cheek, but he says there were lyrics to the exfiles"
00:24:53,00:24:58,theme tune by Mark Snow and these are the lyrics.
00:24:58,00:25:05,"The exfiles is a show, show, show, show, show, with music by Mark Snow, snow, snow, snow."
00:25:05,00:25:10,Those are the only two lyrics that we know of according to DeColvany.
00:25:10,00:25:13,Do you guys know what composers of TV theme tunes hate?
00:25:13,00:25:14,I guess.
00:25:14,00:25:21,"Oh, when on TV shows, when the continuity announcer goes next up on BBC Three."
00:25:21,00:25:24,That's a really good point.
00:25:24,00:25:29,"I'm specifically talking about the skip intro button, which is very controversial."
00:25:29,00:25:34,"They get furious, those guys and gals, about the skip intro because Netflix found out that"
00:25:34,00:25:37,"users were frequently fast forwarding a bit because, you know, if you're watching three"
00:25:37,00:25:40,"episodes in a night, you don't want to see the theme tune three times."
00:25:40,00:25:45,"So Netflix claims, I can't quite believe this, skip intro is pressed 136 million times a"
00:25:45,00:25:51,"day, which cumulatively saves 130 years of human time."
00:25:51,00:25:57,"We never, especially the shows where they've put some proper effort into the, into the"
00:25:57,00:25:58,intros.
00:25:58,00:26:00,I think you lose quite a lot from not having those intros.
00:26:00,00:26:04,Can you imagine watching Game of Thrones and not having that amazing theme tune with
00:26:04,00:26:09,all the stuff happening and then just going straight into the shaggy nuts?
00:26:09,00:26:10,"Yeah, exactly."
00:26:10,00:26:11,Yeah.
00:26:11,00:26:12,It really sets the vibe.
00:26:12,00:26:17,I think grooving to the soprano's theme is like maybe 30% of what I like about watching
00:26:17,00:26:18,the show.
00:26:18,00:26:22,"Obviously the rest of the other 70% is that it's groundbreaking, beautiful human drama."
00:26:22,00:26:25,But the theme tune is also up there.
00:26:25,00:26:26,It's a bop.
00:26:26,00:26:27,I agree.
00:26:27,00:26:28,We stand up in our house.
00:26:28,00:26:30,We stand in silence for every theme tune.
00:26:30,00:26:32,It's a huge respect in this household.
00:26:32,00:26:36,"Monica, aren't you show running on a show at the moment?"
00:26:36,00:26:38,I just finished show running on a show.
00:26:38,00:26:40,Are you going to get to pick the theme tune?
00:26:40,00:26:44,I think we're going to have like proper opening titles.
00:26:44,00:26:46,"So we're going to have to do a whole, you're going to have to figure out a whole thing."
00:26:46,00:26:47,Yeah.
00:26:47,00:26:50,"I've really been shown my own limitations in this area because my description is like,"
00:26:50,00:26:53,I want it to sound cool.
00:26:53,00:26:58,"No, out of their fiend back home."
00:26:58,00:27:00,"Well, I got, I got some advice for you, Monica."
00:27:00,00:27:05,"If you're working with the sound person, do a, do a secret thing here, which is do actually"
00:27:05,00:27:11,"write lyrics to whatever the theme tune is, but don't put them out because you could then"
00:27:11,00:27:13,claim 50% royalties on the song.
00:27:13,00:27:16,This is what Jean Roddenberry did with Star Trek.
00:27:16,00:27:18,He wrote lyrics for the Star Trek song.
00:27:18,00:27:20,They never use them.
00:27:20,00:27:23,"And anytime a royalty check came in, he was a co-writer of the song."
00:27:23,00:27:25,So he got 50% of everything.
00:27:25,00:27:27,And the song suicide is painless.
00:27:27,00:27:28,The mash theme tune.
00:27:28,00:27:34,It was used in the Robert Altman movie commissioned specifically for that movie by Robert Altman.
00:27:34,00:27:37,"And he tried to write the lyrics for it, couldn't crack it."
00:27:37,00:27:42,"And so he asked his son, Michael, who was 15 years old at the time, to write the lyrics."
00:27:42,00:27:44,So Michael did that.
00:27:44,00:27:49,"And as a result of that song not only being used in the movie, but then the long running"
00:27:49,00:27:54,"TV show with Alan Alder, he says, Altman says that he made $70,000 for directing that"
00:27:54,00:27:55,movie.
00:27:55,00:28:00,And his son has earned more than a million dollars over the years just from that being
00:28:00,00:28:01,sold.
00:28:01,00:28:04,"Those lyrics are good though, aren't they, for suicide is painless."
00:28:04,00:28:09,"But G. Roddenberry, is he not just stealing half of the credit?"
00:28:09,00:28:10,Yeah.
00:28:10,00:28:11,It feels like it.
00:28:11,00:28:14,It feels like the workers and the musicians who have done all this work and he's just
00:28:14,00:28:17,"like, well, I'll pretend that I've written some lyrics and take half the money."
00:28:17,00:28:19,It's quite cheeky.
00:28:19,00:28:20,It's very cheeky.
00:28:20,00:28:22,"Hey, that's the business we're in, guys."
00:28:22,00:28:23,And Monica.
00:28:23,00:28:24,Is it?
00:28:24,00:28:25,Oh.
00:28:25,00:28:26,"That's Hollywood, baby."
00:28:26,00:28:27,Gosh.
00:28:27,00:28:28,Business is business.
00:28:28,00:28:33,"Just quickly, Ed Sheeran has written the theme tune to James Bond, despite no one having"
00:28:33,00:28:37,"requested that he do that, which I think is quite sweet."
00:28:37,00:28:39,I think that's a very Ed Sheeran thing to do.
00:28:39,00:28:44,"But that's, isn't that, I would say that when a new Bond comes out, people submit songs."
00:28:44,00:28:45,That's how that's always worked.
00:28:45,00:28:46,"No, it's not."
00:28:46,00:28:47,You don't send in.
00:28:47,00:28:51,There are so many songs that are out that are rejected Bond songs by bands that submitted
00:28:51,00:28:53,"a song that didn't get used, which they then use."
00:28:53,00:28:54,Is there a process?
00:28:54,00:28:57,"Is there an open process by which, I mean, could we submit one?"
00:28:57,00:28:58,Yeah.
00:28:58,00:28:59,That's what I was thinking.
00:28:59,00:29:00,Did they accept anything?
00:29:00,00:29:01,They've...
00:29:01,00:29:02,That can't be true.
00:29:02,00:29:04,I thought that they would commission a cool art.
00:29:04,00:29:06,It can't be like a bake-off.
00:29:06,00:29:09,"The last film, they asked Billie Eilish to do..."
00:29:09,00:29:10,Yeah.
00:29:10,00:29:11,"No, she just got lucky."
00:29:11,00:29:13,She just happens to have the best what they said in a million.
00:29:13,00:29:14,Yeah.
00:29:14,00:29:15,Wow.
00:29:15,00:29:16,Exactly.
00:29:16,00:29:17,And hers just happens to be the best one.
00:29:17,00:29:18,And they listen to them blind as well.
00:29:18,00:29:19,Yeah.
00:29:19,00:29:20,"They don't, you know, they don't prejudice themselves."
00:29:20,00:29:21,It's like the voice.
00:29:21,00:29:22,It's like the voice.
00:29:22,00:29:23,It could be anyone.
00:29:23,00:29:24,"But I can't be true, Dan."
00:29:24,00:29:25,It can't be true.
00:29:25,00:29:27,"Because they always pick the trendiest person in the world at the time, don't they?"
00:29:27,00:29:28,"No, I mean..."
00:29:28,00:29:31,And Ed Sheeran has consistently been the second trendiest person in the world.
00:29:31,00:29:33,She just keeps missing it.
00:29:33,00:29:36,The reason I say it is I know that Radiohead had a rejected Bond song.
00:29:36,00:29:38,So I'm trying to work back from there.
00:29:38,00:29:41,And I'm pretty sure Johnny Cash had one as well.
00:29:41,00:29:43,And I think this is a thing.
00:29:43,00:29:44,Yeah.
00:29:44,00:29:45,But I can't say for sure.
00:29:45,00:29:46,Wow.
00:29:46,00:29:49,"Maybe they asked people to tender for it, rather than anyone being able to send stuff in."
00:29:49,00:29:50,"Oh, yeah."
00:29:50,00:29:51,I think they sent...
00:29:51,00:29:53,"I think they asked, like, a group of people."
00:29:53,00:29:54,I don't think it is open.
00:29:54,00:29:55,Right.
00:29:55,00:29:56,Yeah.
00:29:56,00:29:57,It's not quite as open as that.
00:29:57,00:29:58,Open season.
00:29:58,00:29:59,Because you'd see...
00:29:59,00:30:00,"There'd be a thing every three years, wouldn't there?"
00:30:00,00:30:01,"Yeah, exactly."
00:30:01,00:30:04,Have you guys heard of Dusan Sestic?
00:30:04,00:30:07,He's a composer of the Bosnian National Anthem.
00:30:07,00:30:09,We spoke about Bosnia earlier.
00:30:09,00:30:14,He entered the competition to do the Bosnian National Anthem.
00:30:14,00:30:15,He did really want to win.
00:30:15,00:30:18,"He just wanted to get, like, second or third place."
00:30:18,00:30:19,There was money for it.
00:30:19,00:30:21,"He, like, was quite into the old Yugoslavia."
00:30:21,00:30:23,He didn't really care about the new Bosnia.
00:30:23,00:30:27,"But he thought, ""I'll get some money out of it because I'm a decent composer."""
00:30:27,00:30:31,"Anyway, he won and he wrote the National Anthem for Bosnia."
00:30:31,00:30:36,"And then, in 2009, someone noticed that it was remarkably similar to the theme tune of"
00:30:36,00:30:40,"National Lampoon's Animal House, the 1978 movie."
00:30:40,00:30:41,Right.
00:30:41,00:30:45,"And when you listen to the both, they are almost identical."
00:30:45,00:30:48,"Like, there is no difference whatsoever."
00:30:48,00:30:53,"But, bless him, he went on TV and they were all like, ""Well, how come you made our National"
00:30:53,00:30:54,"Lampoon the theme tune?"""
00:30:54,00:30:56,"She said, ""That's the Lampoon's Animal House."""
00:30:56,00:31:00,"And he said, ""Oh, maybe as a young man, I heard it and it kind of stuck in my head."
00:31:00,00:31:02,But I didn't deliberately plagiarise it.
00:31:02,00:31:03,"It just so happened."""
00:31:03,00:31:04,That is brilliant.
00:31:04,00:31:05,Yeah.
00:31:05,00:31:10,This is the problem with big national policies being decided by right-in contest.
00:31:10,00:31:14,This is why Canadian legal tender is called the Looney and the Tooney.
00:31:14,00:31:17,"Oh, what?"
00:31:17,00:31:19,"The $1 coin has a loon on it, so it's called the Looney."
00:31:19,00:31:23,"And then they had a contest to name the $2 coin, which has a polar bear on it."
00:31:23,00:31:26,And the winning entry was the Tooney.
00:31:26,00:31:28,And now that is actually what we call it.
00:31:28,00:31:32,And it just makes us sound like a joke country.
00:31:32,00:31:36,"Without knowing the other options, Monica, I do think Tooney's quite good."
00:31:36,00:31:39,I think there's a bit of Bodie McBoatface to it.
00:31:39,00:31:40,"Yeah, yeah."
00:31:40,00:31:41,We can't speak.
00:31:41,00:31:42,Haven't they also...
00:31:42,00:31:43,The Looney and the Tooney.
00:31:43,00:31:44,"Yeah, it works."
00:31:44,00:31:53,"Haven't they recently, just while we're talking about money and having mentioned Star Trek,"
00:31:53,00:31:58,"there was the thing where you would spockify your Canadian dollar, right?"
00:31:58,00:32:03,The guy who was on the picture looks so similar to Leonardo Nimoy from Star Trek that you
00:32:03,00:32:06,"would draw spockiers on him and you would draw the hair, basically."
00:32:06,00:32:07,"Yes, it was called spocking."
00:32:07,00:32:08,Spocking.
00:32:08,00:32:14,And the Bank of Canada had to issue a statement saying that it was legal to do but inappropriate.
00:32:14,00:32:21,"And I think they've, from what I read, they've changed his image now on the bill."
00:32:21,00:32:22,Is that right?
00:32:22,00:32:25,There's a new version of the same guy just so it's less spockable.
00:32:25,00:32:26,Yeah.
00:32:26,00:32:31,"I think if you draw that spock on any note, then Chee Roddenberry owns half your money."
00:32:31,00:32:36,"Yeah, and then a spock, that was spockspersonic for another agency in Canada, an angel agency"
00:32:36,00:32:40,"said to the Bank of Canada, ""This is fine as you say it's perfectly legal and I'm sure"
00:32:40,00:32:43,Sir Wilfrid Laurier would get it.
00:32:43,00:32:46,"Who's the man pictured off the bill who died in 1919."""
00:32:46,00:32:53,"I've just got one more theme tune I quickly want to bring up, which is The Fresh Prince"
00:32:53,00:32:54,of Bel Air.
00:32:54,00:32:57,So we all know that theme tune.
00:32:57,00:33:03,It's a Kraken song by Will Smith and it was a song that he wrote despite not being necessarily
00:33:03,00:33:04,asked to write it at the time.
00:33:04,00:33:07,"He kind of just did it and he showed it to, I believe it was Quincy Jones who was doing"
00:33:07,00:33:11,"the music for the show and they said, ""Yeah, you can go and do it."""
00:33:11,00:33:15,"Obviously it's a massive hit and when it was released in 1992 as a single, but here's"
00:33:15,00:33:19,"the thing, I don't know if James, you bought singles as you were saying back in the day."
00:33:19,00:33:25,"In 1992, The Fresh Prince of Bel Air theme tune was only released exclusively in the Netherlands"
00:33:25,00:33:27,and Spain and that's where it charted.
00:33:27,00:33:28,That's it.
00:33:28,00:33:32,"That's really, because when you said that, I thought to myself, how come I didn't buy"
00:33:32,00:33:33,that?
00:33:33,00:33:36,"Like I was so sure that I would, if I was around at the time I would have bought it because"
00:33:36,00:33:40,I bought Wicky Wicky Wild Wild West or whatever it was by Will Smith.
00:33:40,00:33:41,Great song.
00:33:41,00:33:44,"Yeah, I bought all his other crap, so I was really surprised."
00:33:44,00:33:47,"James, did you buy Willenium?"
00:33:47,00:33:48,That was a great album.
00:33:48,00:33:49,"Oh, an album."
00:33:49,00:33:51,"No, I was more of a singles buyer really."
00:33:51,00:33:54,It's not a good album then.
00:33:54,00:34:00,"I'm sorry, I think enough time has passed that I'm able to have a pop at Willenium."
00:34:00,00:34:07,What's the name of that album out of your dash?
00:34:07,00:34:13,"Okay, it is time for fact number three and that is my fact."
00:34:13,00:34:19,"My fact this week is that in 2024, the first ever theater production of Dracula will celebrate"
00:34:19,00:34:21,its hundredth anniversary.
00:34:21,00:34:26,"Unfortunately, fans can't celebrate it in the venue it was performed in because it's"
00:34:26,00:34:33,currently occupied by an over 18s adult themed crazy golf course called the House of Holes.
00:34:33,00:34:36,Filthy.
00:34:36,00:34:43,"This is in Darby, a city in the UK and I was there recently on the weekend for a game of"
00:34:43,00:34:44,bitty golf.
00:34:44,00:34:47,How was your quick round?
00:34:47,00:34:52,I was there doing a ghost story festival and afterwards I was hanging out with this really
00:34:52,00:34:56,cool guy called Chris Horton and he said I've got a fish fact for you.
00:34:56,00:35:01,"And he told me he'd passed the House of Holes and made him laugh and so yeah, so it is a"
00:35:01,00:35:04,very well known theater as well as called the Grand Theater.
00:35:04,00:35:08,Then it just got repurposed over the years to be something new and there was restaurants
00:35:08,00:35:13,in its place and so on and now there is this amazing crazy golf.
00:35:13,00:35:14,The House of Holes.
00:35:14,00:35:15,Yeah.
00:35:15,00:35:19,"Can I just, I'm sure we'll talk more about crazy or can I talk specifically about the"
00:35:19,00:35:21,House of Holes and Darby.
00:35:21,00:35:22,"Yeah, sure."
00:35:22,00:35:24,I don't mean to cast any experts on it.
00:35:24,00:35:25,I don't think it's terribly erotic.
00:35:25,00:35:26,It doesn't seem to be from the website.
00:35:26,00:35:27,"Oh, really?"
00:35:27,00:35:29,It seems like a lot of it just seems to be novelty.
00:35:29,00:35:32,"Because I think that people at home, some people at home will have an image in their"
00:35:32,00:35:35,heads of what it is.
00:35:35,00:35:36,Yeah.
00:35:36,00:35:38,But let's sort of give context then through images.
00:35:38,00:35:44,"One of the holes, you have to hit the ball through a bunch of standing dildos for example."
00:35:44,00:35:46,"Yes, I'm not saying it's totally erotic."
00:35:46,00:35:52,There's another one where for some reason there's a lot of blow-up dolls that are uninflated
00:35:52,00:35:57,"hanging on washing lines, just hanging in the vicinity of the hole itself."
00:35:57,00:36:01,"Yeah, the area where you play pool, because you know these places, indoor places have"
00:36:01,00:36:03,"like, you can play arcades and stuff."
00:36:03,00:36:07,The area where you play pool is called anal butt.
00:36:07,00:36:08,What?
00:36:08,00:36:14,"Yeah, and anal has a four instead of the second A in anal, so AN4L butt."
00:36:14,00:36:16,"Well, it's not got to do with pool."
00:36:16,00:36:17,What does that mean?
00:36:17,00:36:18,Not quite sure.
00:36:18,00:36:19,I couldn't get to the bottom of that one.
00:36:19,00:36:20,But it's there.
00:36:20,00:36:26,"Surely the phrase anal and butt are sort of achieving the same, feeling a little redundant"
00:36:26,00:36:27,to me personally.
00:36:27,00:36:30,"It's definitely a redundant adjective, isn't it?"
00:36:30,00:36:33,"How's your butt, well, it's very anal."
00:36:33,00:36:38,"But I don't know what's in the water in Derby, but there was a newspaper piece a couple of"
00:36:38,00:36:39,months ago.
00:36:39,00:36:45,Derby is now about to get its second erotic mini golf venue.
00:36:45,00:36:46,It's really popular.
00:36:46,00:36:56,The new glory holes golf venue will apparently include risque items and decor and some Derby
00:36:56,00:36:57,themed holes as well.
00:36:57,00:36:58,So that's nice.
00:36:58,00:36:59,That's cool.
00:36:59,00:37:00,That's good.
00:37:00,00:37:03,"Can I quickly, just because let's give this fact just a tiny bit of substance before we"
00:37:03,00:37:09,"get into erotic golf, I just want to quickly say that the production just for context was"
00:37:09,00:37:15,the first ever Dracula production and it was put on in the early 1920s and it was a show
00:37:15,00:37:21,"that was sanctioned and approved by Florence Stoker, who was the widow of Bram Stoker."
00:37:21,00:37:25,And this was the production that became the sort of official theater production that as
00:37:25,00:37:31,"it traveled around the UK and then went international, cast in its lead, Bella Lagosi, who became,"
00:37:31,00:37:34,"as we all know, the iconic Dracula in film."
00:37:34,00:37:41,"And weirdly, the final performance that Bella Lagosi ever did as Dracula on stage was back"
00:37:41,00:37:47,in Derby at another theater just around the corner from the ground some 20-odd years later.
00:37:47,00:37:52,"So Derby does have a real Dracula connection as a result of this, very interesting."
00:37:52,00:37:57,"And Lagosi, so he got the role in 1927 when the play moved to the USA."
00:37:57,00:37:58,That's when Lagosi entered the scene.
00:37:58,00:38:03,"And then in the fifties, it was when he toured again and came back to Derby and did a big"
00:38:03,00:38:05,English tour of this show.
00:38:05,00:38:08,And he got really upset because apparently the audiences were laughing sometimes because
00:38:08,00:38:10,Dracula was no longer the big scary thing.
00:38:10,00:38:14,"It had been, it was the early fifties, you know, people have been through a bit since"
00:38:14,00:38:15,the time t's.
00:38:15,00:38:21,"They, they're not as scared and yeah, it seems to have prompted the end of his career, which"
00:38:21,00:38:22,is very sad.
00:38:22,00:38:26,"And it was also this play was also very important for the image of Dracula, the guy who wrote"
00:38:26,00:38:28,"it, a guy called Hamilton Dean."
00:38:28,00:38:34,He made Dracula appear as that more modern suave sort of coat wearing cocktail drinking
00:38:34,00:38:40,kind of character rather than Brams just all out vampire chaos energy zombie like sir.
00:38:40,00:38:43,"Does it, he drink cocktails?"
00:38:43,00:38:44,Does he?
00:38:44,00:38:46,Is it passion fruit martini?
00:38:46,00:38:47,"Sorry, he does."
00:38:47,00:38:52,"There was actually one earlier theater production of Dracula, which came out eight days before"
00:38:52,00:38:54,the novel came out.
00:38:54,00:38:59,"This was if you did a novel, someone else could make a play of it and there's not much"
00:38:59,00:39:03,you can do about it unless you put on your own play.
00:39:03,00:39:10,And so what Bram Stoker did was he had a dramatic reading of his book on stage.
00:39:10,00:39:13,They had to have it open for the paying public.
00:39:13,00:39:20,So they would put bills up half an hour before it started saying Dracula on in half an hour
00:39:20,00:39:26,add two people bought tickets for it and sat in the audience while a couple of actors sort
00:39:26,00:39:28,of just read through the book.
00:39:28,00:39:32,"And from them doing that, it meant that no one else could play on because he owed copyright"
00:39:32,00:39:33,on the theater production.
00:39:33,00:39:34,How amazing.
00:39:34,00:39:35,Yeah.
00:39:35,00:39:36,"Monica, have you done that with really good actually?"
00:39:36,00:39:40,I should do to stop someone doing a bootleg play.
00:39:40,00:39:46,That's basically what my experience of doing the Edinburgh fringe was going out half an
00:39:46,00:39:53,"hour before the show being like somebody and then you know, mildly entertaining two people."
00:39:53,00:39:57,"Chills, actual chills remembering that everyone's Edinburgh."
00:39:57,00:39:58,Yeah.
00:39:58,00:39:59,"Okay, Dan."
00:39:59,00:40:00,We've done the Dracula thing.
00:40:00,00:40:01,Can we go back to the erotic?
00:40:01,00:40:02,Mini golf.
00:40:02,00:40:03,Let's do it.
00:40:03,00:40:07,"I just remembered when you were talking about that that I have played not played golf, but"
00:40:07,00:40:14,I've used a golf club shaped like a penis at the penis museum in Reykjavik.
00:40:14,00:40:18,They have one and you can sort of pick it up and play with it.
00:40:18,00:40:24,"And yeah, it's like it's just the head part of the golf club is shaped like a penis."
00:40:24,00:40:26,"But it's not it's not for a serious golfer, right?"
00:40:26,00:40:30,"As in it's not built for proper play, you know, master's conditions."
00:40:30,00:40:35,I don't think it adheres to the official USPGA rules.
00:40:35,00:40:36,It's like a walking stick full of bagels.
00:40:36,00:40:42,You're not going to use it as an actual assist as a walking stick.
00:40:42,00:40:48,I think there's a link between the original boom in crazy golf and the current Derby based
00:40:48,00:40:50,boom in erotic golf.
00:40:50,00:40:51,Okay.
00:40:51,00:40:52,So when was the original boom?
00:40:52,00:40:55,Twenties and thirties.
00:40:55,00:40:58,Some some lots of sources say that it completely went out when the Great Depression happened.
00:40:58,00:41:05,"But actually, it didn't really it actually boomed during the early thirties."
00:41:05,00:41:09,"During that period, apparently the USA built 25,000 mini golf courses."
00:41:09,00:41:14,It was described as a devastating craze in the times in 1930.
00:41:14,00:41:17,And I think the theory behind it is that property value had collapsed and the value of lots
00:41:17,00:41:21,of things have collapsed and people started their own tiny businesses to generate small
00:41:21,00:41:23,amounts of income.
00:41:23,00:41:27,"You know, it doesn't have to be anything huge, but it's it's a small local thing on"
00:41:27,00:41:30,whatever kind of waste ground or land you've got.
00:41:30,00:41:34,"You know, some restaurants turned it half the restaurant became a mini golf course and"
00:41:34,00:41:36,the rest of it stayed a restaurant.
00:41:36,00:41:39,So maybe times of financial hardship when you get a lot more mini golf because you get
00:41:39,00:41:41,shops that are closed or empty.
00:41:41,00:41:45,So the new glory hole golf is the site of the old gap store in Derby.
00:41:45,00:41:47,"You know, you've got retail space available."
00:41:47,00:41:48,What is a glory hole?
00:41:48,00:41:49,I've got a gap.
00:41:49,00:41:54,"So no, that's my economic theory."
00:41:54,00:41:56,"No, it's a really, yeah, it's a really good theory."
00:41:56,00:41:59,"It's almost a thesis rather than a podcast, isn't it?"
00:41:59,00:42:01,Mini golf doesn't use golf balls.
00:42:01,00:42:04,"Yes, they do."
00:42:04,00:42:09,There are there are special mini golf balls.
00:42:09,00:42:10,They're kind of more rubbery.
00:42:10,00:42:11,They're more rubbery.
00:42:11,00:42:12,They bounce more.
00:42:12,00:42:14,And there's a stand that I find this mad.
00:42:14,00:42:16,There's the world crazy golf championships.
00:42:16,00:42:19,"I mean, there are a few world crazy golf championships."
00:42:19,00:42:23,One is in Hastings and normally apparently they only get about three overseas players
00:42:23,00:42:24,each year.
00:42:24,00:42:29,"So the extent to which this world is a bit debatable, but they don't tell you at the"
00:42:29,00:42:34,world crazy golf championships what the ball is until the day before it starts.
00:42:34,00:42:37,"Okay, but it's always going to be spherical."
00:42:37,00:42:38,It's always going to be spherical.
00:42:38,00:42:39,I'm pretty sure about that.
00:42:39,00:42:43,"But then other championships, they will they'll let you play a different ball on every hole."
00:42:43,00:42:46,"And the only rule is that once you've started a hole, you have to play the same ball all"
00:42:46,00:42:47,the way through the end.
00:42:47,00:42:48,Like normal golf.
00:42:48,00:42:49,Is that true?
00:42:49,00:42:50,How about local?
00:42:50,00:42:51,Or mini golf?
00:42:51,00:42:53,Like we play in Narrabean in Australia.
00:42:53,00:42:55,They're using special balls.
00:42:55,00:42:58,I think they'll be more rubbery for sure if you check them.
00:42:58,00:42:59,Yeah.
00:42:59,00:43:03,Who would have thought this would be the fact that blew my mind most in this whole round
00:43:03,00:43:05,of nine years golf again.
00:43:05,00:43:07,I'm going.
00:43:07,00:43:11,This is I'm afraid it's back to the it's back to a tangent from the original erotic
00:43:11,00:43:12,mini golf thing.
00:43:12,00:43:13,Oh yeah.
00:43:13,00:43:16,"Just that it was on, you know, this new place opening up is going to be called glory holes"
00:43:16,00:43:17,golf.
00:43:17,00:43:22,And we got an email in the fish and box recently subject line Gibbon glory hole action.
00:43:22,00:43:23,Oh my God.
00:43:23,00:43:24,I know this story.
00:43:24,00:43:25,This is incredible.
00:43:25,00:43:29,This is a Gibbon in a zoo or a sanctuary.
00:43:29,00:43:34,This is a female Gibbon and she was living on her own and she got pregnant and it
00:43:34,00:43:39,was it was basically a virgin birth and it was it was so exciting for the scientists.
00:43:39,00:43:40,They thought I can't believe this.
00:43:40,00:43:44,"Anyway, they did a bit of an investigation and it turned out obviously it was not a virgin"
00:43:44,00:43:45,birth.
00:43:45,00:43:51,In between her enclosure and the next door neighbor male Gibbons enclosure was a nine
00:43:51,00:43:59,millimeter hole through which they had managed to successfully breed and become parents.
00:43:59,00:44:00,Nine.
00:44:00,00:44:04,They were just sort of both mushing up against the wall.
00:44:04,00:44:06,I'm afraid so.
00:44:06,00:44:07,Life finds a way.
00:44:07,00:44:08,Yes.
00:44:08,00:44:09,Wow.
00:44:09,00:44:11,That's a scene I don't want to see in Jurassic Park.
00:44:11,00:44:15,I would like to hear David Attenborough do one of his little jokes.
00:44:15,00:44:19,You know when he sort of makes the animals a fool or he's like our nest is as good a
00:44:19,00:44:21,place as any.
00:44:21,00:44:31,"Okay, it's time for our final fact of the show and that is James."
00:44:31,00:44:36,"Okay, my fact this week is that in twenty nine and eight to the Canadian Prime Minister"
00:44:36,00:44:42,called ten Downing Street to offer condolences for the death of Margaret Thatcher.
00:44:42,00:44:44,"In fact, she wasn't dead."
00:44:44,00:44:48,It was a misunderstanding due to the death of the Canadian Transport Minister's cat
00:44:48,00:44:50,who was also called Thatcher.
00:44:50,00:44:51,Superb.
00:44:51,00:44:52,Yeah.
00:44:52,00:44:53,Really good.
00:44:53,00:44:54,What a cool.
00:44:54,00:44:55,What a cool.
00:44:55,00:44:56,Flying the wall at that cool.
00:44:56,00:44:57,Yeah.
00:44:57,00:44:58,"A muggy, not a Maggie."
00:44:58,00:44:59,"Oh, brilliant."
00:44:59,00:45:00,Brilliant.
00:45:00,00:45:01,Was that you Dan?
00:45:01,00:45:02,Someone else?
00:45:02,00:45:03,"No, no, no."
00:45:03,00:45:04,That's the headline of the Guardian article.
00:45:04,00:45:05,That's wrong.
00:45:05,00:45:06,Amazing.
00:45:06,00:45:08,It was a black tie dinner in Toronto.
00:45:08,00:45:14,Two thousand Canadian Conservatives were there and many of them got a text message saying
00:45:14,00:45:21,"simply Thatcher has died and Demetri Seedas, who was the aide to the Prime Minister, who"
00:45:21,00:45:26,"was Stephen Harper at the time, he was sent to ride a letter of condolence and he ran"
00:45:26,00:45:31,Buckingham Palace in Ten Downing Street to kind of work out what they should say and
00:45:31,00:45:36,"you know, and offer condolences as well and then he found out that they hadn't died and"
00:45:36,00:45:42,it turned out that Transport Minister John Baird had a 16 year old grey cat called Thatcher
00:45:42,00:45:48,and sadly that cat had died but he denied sending the text later on but there definitely
00:45:48,00:45:52,was a text that was sent to all these people about the cat.
00:45:52,00:45:57,This is like international incident version of David's dead on Big Brezwick.
00:45:57,00:45:58,Yes.
00:45:58,00:46:02,That's the greatest TV moment ever.
00:46:02,00:46:04,There was a famous David who died.
00:46:04,00:46:05,David Bowie.
00:46:05,00:46:06,Yeah.
00:46:06,00:46:10,"Did someone in the building know who, I don't know why I'm telling this story, everyone"
00:46:10,00:46:11,knows it better than me apparently.
00:46:11,00:46:12,"Monica, you can tell it."
00:46:12,00:46:13,"No, no, no."
00:46:13,00:46:14,"Please, you tell it."
00:46:14,00:46:15,I've actually only seen the clip.
00:46:15,00:46:19,"Okay, so in the Big Brother household that year was Angie Bowie, the first wife of David"
00:46:19,00:46:25,"Bowie and also in the house that year was David Guest, who was Liza Minnelli's ex-husband."
00:46:25,00:46:26,Right.
00:46:26,00:46:30,Angie gets called in while David Guest is having a sleep in his bed.
00:46:30,00:46:34,Everyone knows he's having a sleep so he's not around and she gets told that David Bowie
00:46:34,00:46:41,"has died, so she is obviously, she didn't like her ex-husband, but she's also very distressed"
00:46:41,00:46:42,because he was a huge part of her life.
00:46:42,00:46:46,"She comes out, she's trying to keep it secret, and one of the other Americans who's staying"
00:46:46,00:46:49,"in the house comes up and says, ""Are you okay?"""
00:46:49,00:46:52,"And she says, ""You can't tell anyone, but David's dead."""
00:46:52,00:46:56,And this other woman immediately freaks out because she thinks it's David Guest who's
00:46:56,00:46:59,"died, but Angie hasn't made the connection."
00:46:59,00:47:02,"So Angie's kind of going, ""God, I didn't think you were that big a Bowie fan."
00:47:02,00:47:07,"I can't see how this has erupted, and it causes chaos in the house for five minutes."
00:47:07,00:47:08,"It's TV at its finest."""
00:47:08,00:47:11,"Well, imagine that, but with 2,000 Canadian conservatives."
00:47:11,00:47:12,Yeah.
00:47:12,00:47:14,What a scene it must have been.
00:47:14,00:47:16,The true patriot love tribute dinner.
00:47:16,00:47:17,"Oh, is that what it was?"
00:47:17,00:47:18,That's what it was called.
00:47:18,00:47:22,"Military family's honoring thing, but Canadian politics moniker is fabulous."
00:47:22,00:47:24,Who's doing it?
00:47:24,00:47:29,"Well, I feel like there is, I feel like there is a list of political scandals in Canada"
00:47:29,00:47:36,"on Wikipedia and some of them are pretty dry, like the usual grift or bribery or slightly"
00:47:36,00:47:37,dodgy dealings.
00:47:37,00:47:39,But there are some fun ones.
00:47:39,00:47:42,Tunergate might be my favorite.
00:47:42,00:47:43,Tunergate.
00:47:43,00:47:45,"Were you involved in Tunergate, Monica?"
00:47:45,00:47:48,"Not to my knowledge, but I'll never admit it if so."
00:47:48,00:47:50,You'll never catch me.
00:47:50,00:47:51,Sorry.
00:47:51,00:47:54,"Tunergate, actually think about it now, Tunergate is way too long ago."
00:47:54,00:47:55,You're clear.
00:47:55,00:47:56,You're clear.
00:47:56,00:47:57,You're clear.
00:47:57,00:47:59,I'm a Canadian cans of decomposing tuna.
00:47:59,00:48:01,"Oh, that was the central problem, right?"
00:48:01,00:48:05,"And it wasn't really, really, really unsafe, but it had started to go off before it was"
00:48:05,00:48:06,put in the cans.
00:48:06,00:48:10,"The firm involved was called Starkis and they said, ""No, you just, these inspectors, they"
00:48:10,00:48:12,just don't like fish.
00:48:12,00:48:13,"That's their problem."""
00:48:13,00:48:15,"And they said, ""And we'll close down our plant and you'll lose all these jobs."""
00:48:15,00:48:18,"And you know, and that's when it becomes a political thing."
00:48:18,00:48:22,"Because then the fisheries minister said, ""Oh, yeah, it's probably, it's fine."
00:48:22,00:48:23,"Yeah, all this stuff, it's great."
00:48:23,00:48:25,"It's actually good."""
00:48:25,00:48:29,"And he got a panel together, just like, ""Look, can you just assess this tuna, please?"""
00:48:29,00:48:31,"And they said, ""Yeah, this is rotting tuna in these cans."""
00:48:31,00:48:34,"And he says, ""Okay, I think we need a different panel."""
00:48:34,00:48:37,"And he got a different panel together who eventually said, ""Yes, these million tons"
00:48:37,00:48:39,"of rotting tuna are fine."""
00:48:39,00:48:40,And then he resigned.
00:48:40,00:48:41,Yeah.
00:48:41,00:48:42,And I don't think much of the tuna was eaten in the end.
00:48:42,00:48:44,And then the firm went bust anyway.
00:48:44,00:48:49,"So that's a very classic Canadian scandal where it's like, it threatened to really kick off"
00:48:49,00:48:55,"and ultimately they just, nobody really consumed the tuna and it was sort of fine."
00:48:55,00:48:59,"That's like the other great Canadian political scandal, the Fuddleduddle incident."
00:48:59,00:49:00,What's this?
00:49:00,00:49:06,"The Fuddleduddle incident in 1971 happened to the first Prime Minister Trudeau, our current"
00:49:06,00:49:11,"Prime Minister's father, who was accused of having spoken or at least mouthed unparliamentary"
00:49:11,00:49:13,language in the House of Commons.
00:49:13,00:49:18,"He seemed to have been caught mouthing the words ""fuck off."""
00:49:18,00:49:23,"But when pressed by television reporters would only admit having moved his lips, they were"
00:49:23,00:49:25,"like, ""What were you thinking when you moved your lips?"""
00:49:25,00:49:31,"And his response was, ""What is the nature of your thoughts when you say Fuddleduddle"
00:49:31,00:49:33,"or something like that?"""
00:49:33,00:49:36,"Implying that he had said Fuddleduddle instead of ""fuck off."""
00:49:36,00:49:37,Right.
00:49:37,00:49:38,That's good.
00:49:38,00:49:41,"If no one's heard you, you know, you're across the room from them."
00:49:41,00:49:46,"Well, then in 2015, his son actually stated on the record that his dad had not said Fuddleduddle."
00:49:46,00:49:47,And this is a big scandal.
00:49:47,00:49:48,Minor scandal.
00:49:48,00:49:49,But that's sort of the scale.
00:49:49,00:49:55,"It's like someone, that's always the scale, it's always a little bit funny, like someone"
00:49:55,00:49:59,threw a pie in Jean Chrétien's face in the '90s and that was quite a big deal.
00:49:59,00:50:05,"The pies were actually coordinated ongoing assault with Fuddleduddle, entartiste, sewer"
00:50:05,00:50:08,Canadian satirical political group.
00:50:08,00:50:14,"And they even released a hit list of people they wanted to get with pies, including Celine"
00:50:14,00:50:16,Dion and Conrad Black and Chrétien.
00:50:16,00:50:20,And then they were successful in pieing Chrétien twice.
00:50:20,00:50:21,Right.
00:50:21,00:50:22,"Oh, that's got to stink."
00:50:22,00:50:27,"The pies, were they the kind of clown pies where it's just custard or is it actual like"
00:50:27,00:50:28,apple pies?
00:50:28,00:50:29,Cream pies.
00:50:29,00:50:31,"Like, oh, it's just cream pies."
00:50:31,00:50:35,It may even have been shaving cream or just like what you guys would unfortunately call
00:50:35,00:50:36,squirty cream.
00:50:36,00:50:37,Squirty cream.
00:50:37,00:50:41,It's not a nice thing to say and I'm sorry to say it.
00:50:41,00:50:46,"Speaking of shaving cream, I can't believe we managed to get onto shaving cream."
00:50:46,00:50:51,"William Lyon Mackenzie King, who was Prime Minister of Canada for 22 years."
00:50:51,00:50:52,My favourite.
00:50:52,00:50:56,"Well, I'm not surprised because he did seances and stuff right then."
00:50:56,00:51:01,"But he also used to see symbols in his shaving cream in the morning, which he thought would"
00:51:01,00:51:02,predict the future.
00:51:02,00:51:03,Yeah.
00:51:03,00:51:04,Wow.
00:51:04,00:51:08,"I mean, he was he was Prime Minister for 21 years, which possibly is still the record"
00:51:08,00:51:09,length or anyone to do it.
00:51:09,00:51:11,He had quite a tragic family life.
00:51:11,00:51:14,He lost all of his family during the war.
00:51:14,00:51:19,"And so as a result, turned like many people did to spirituality as a thing."
00:51:19,00:51:23,But what many people didn't realise at the time was he was taking that spirituality into
00:51:23,00:51:31,the into the office with him as a Prime Minister and getting guidance from the spirits of Leonardo
00:51:31,00:51:34,Da Vinci and his deceased dogs.
00:51:34,00:51:38,"The shaving film thing, he was shaved and then the shaving film would go into the water"
00:51:38,00:51:40,on the in the sink kind of thing.
00:51:40,00:51:46,"And at one stage, he saw a polar bear and an eagle and the polar bear was supposed to"
00:51:46,00:51:50,"represent like Russia or Soviet Union, I should say, and the eagle supposed to represent"
00:51:50,00:51:51,America.
00:51:51,00:51:55,And they were kind of fighting in shaving cream.
00:51:55,00:52:00,"And then a dog appeared in the shaving cream, which he thought symbolised Canada, and then"
00:52:00,00:52:03,it came and helped to push the bear off the eagle.
00:52:03,00:52:08,And that was kind of him thinking that he what side he needs to be in the Cold War needs
00:52:08,00:52:09,to be on the other side.
00:52:09,00:52:12,As if he didn't know what side he should probably be on in the Cold War.
00:52:12,00:52:16,I think that probably just confirmed his suspicions.
00:52:16,00:52:20,I do feel like a polar bear would be fairly easy to see in shaving cream.
00:52:20,00:52:25,"Like I'm wondering if the shapes he was seeing were sort of like, you know, I saw a vision"
00:52:25,00:52:29,in my shaving cream of a cloud meeting sort of a fog.
00:52:29,00:52:30,Yeah.
00:52:30,00:52:31,Oh my God.
00:52:31,00:52:32,What a character.
00:52:32,00:52:33,"Yeah, amazing guy."
00:52:33,00:52:38,"So just having a look through the old, the old fish inbox, podcast at qi.com."
00:52:38,00:52:40,"Really good fact we got in from, from John Ford."
00:52:40,00:52:41,"So thank you, John."
00:52:41,00:52:43,This is something maybe you've done at Monica.
00:52:43,00:52:50,"It's that Canada flies a new flag over its parliament every single day, every single"
00:52:50,00:52:57,"day there's a new flag, and they give the used one to a Canadian and you can apply to"
00:52:57,00:52:58,get your own flag.
00:52:58,00:53:01,And you think I have done this?
00:53:01,00:53:04,"Well, guess it's possible."
00:53:04,00:53:10,Feel like you haven't anymore.
00:53:10,00:53:14,"I haven't quite, no, but if I said that I have the option, well, you have the option,"
00:53:14,00:53:16,but unfortunately you won't get the flag.
00:53:16,00:53:18,So this is a bad thing.
00:53:18,00:53:21,The current waiting time is 100 years.
00:53:21,00:53:24,It's more than a century because so many people have applied.
00:53:24,00:53:27,"So they mentioned this on the website, like it's a totally normal thing."
00:53:27,00:53:30,"Yeah, they say the current waiting time is more than 100 years."
00:53:30,00:53:34,"And so you can either log on and make a request, why would you, or you can change your details"
00:53:34,00:53:38,"if you made a request, you know, five years ago and you're moving house now."
00:53:38,00:53:39,Just to keep it updated.
00:53:39,00:53:41,But why would you do that either?
00:53:41,00:53:44,Are you allowed to do it for your next generation?
00:53:44,00:53:45,Exactly.
00:53:45,00:53:46,Can I go to the descendants?
00:53:46,00:53:50,I don't think I'll know any of my hundred year from now descendants well enough to care
00:53:50,00:53:53,whether or not they get a flag.
00:53:53,00:53:55,It's also like not hard to get.
00:53:55,00:53:56,It's not very special.
00:53:56,00:53:59,It's only been up over a parliament for one day.
00:53:59,00:54:00,Yep.
00:54:00,00:54:02,You could just get your own flag.
00:54:02,00:54:05,It's the kind of shit I buy in eBay.
00:54:05,00:54:08,This is all part of my divorce.
00:54:08,00:54:11,That's giving unreasonable behavior to me actually.
00:54:11,00:54:19,Have you been reading about William Amos from the Liberal Party in the last few months?
00:54:19,00:54:28,Very recently he was on a parliamentary Zoom call and he had to apologize because he said
00:54:28,00:54:35,I urinated without realizing I was on camera and the amazing thing was is that the month
00:54:35,00:54:41,earlier he'd also been recorded in the nude during the virtual session of the Canadian
00:54:41,00:54:42,Parliament.
00:54:42,00:54:44,So twice in two months.
00:54:44,00:54:50,The first time he'd been out for a jog and he was kind of getting changed while the
00:54:50,00:54:53,session was going on and they could see.
00:54:53,00:54:54,See it all.
00:54:54,00:54:55,Yeah.
00:54:55,00:54:56,See the right honorable member.
00:54:56,00:54:59,See his loony and his toony.
00:54:59,00:55:01,But yeah.
00:55:01,00:55:06,I can see myself not falling for that just I can see myself doing that.
00:55:06,00:55:07,Twice in a row?
00:55:07,00:55:10,You quickly check maybe not twice in a row.
00:55:10,00:55:12,I think what's better than this case right?
00:55:12,00:55:16,Yeah I would definitely get a post-it for the camera after the first time.
00:55:16,00:55:17,Yeah.
00:55:17,00:55:18,Would I?
00:55:18,00:55:19,I don't know.
00:55:19,00:55:20,No you would think I couldn't possibly do that again.
00:55:20,00:55:21,That's what you think.
00:55:21,00:55:22,That's what you think.
00:55:22,00:55:24,Oh my god that was the stupidest day of my life.
00:55:24,00:55:28,No more mistakes on that front and then you just go along and you know do you say he was
00:55:28,00:55:30,urinating into a cup or something?
00:55:30,00:55:31,I don't.
00:55:31,00:55:32,I don't know.
00:55:32,00:55:35,As far as I can tell because this kind of thing has now happened you know we're pretty
00:55:35,00:55:36,deep in the pandemic.
00:55:36,00:55:38,It's not happened a number of times.
00:55:38,00:55:43,It's been fairly high profile people and it has as far as I'm aware never happened to
00:55:43,00:55:44,a woman.
00:55:44,00:55:51,It's just men who I don't know haven't thought it through or aren't worried enough.
00:55:51,00:55:54,I can't even believe that you're saying that you think this could happen to you.
00:55:54,00:55:56,This would never happen to me.
00:55:56,00:56:02,There's no world in which I would be like okay I'm doing a work Zoom.
00:56:02,00:56:05,I'm going to quickly get fully nude.
00:56:05,00:56:13,No one has to know.
