WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.280
 Hi everybody, Andy here. Just before we start this week's show, we have two exciting announcements

00:00:06.280 --> 00:00:12.200
 to make. The first is about who our special guest is this week. She is a brilliant Canadian

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:19.900
 writer, screenwriter, showrunner, now also a first time author. She is Monica Heisey

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:24.480
 and her debut novel, Really Good Actually is out within the last few weeks and it is

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:29.120
 unsurprisingly really good actually. It's all about the life and travails of a woman

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:34.040
 who has become a surprisingly young divorcee. It is extremely funny. It's kind of, you

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:39.560
 know, accidentally snort milk out of your nose funny. It's great. Highly recommended.

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:43.800
 So we hope you enjoy the show. Monica was great as you will hear shortly. The second

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:48.800
 announcement we have to make is that we are doing a live show of no such thing as a fish.

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:53.720
 Very exciting. We are going to be at the Hallowed British Library in London. They are having

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:59.480
 a season all about animals and as part of that, we are doing a show called Fantastic Beasts.

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:03.540
 It's going to be Dan, James, myself and a special guest to be announced. It's going

00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:07.120
 to be on the 21st of April and if you don't live anywhere near the British Library, there

00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:14.520
 is also going to be a streamed version of it. So just go to no such thing as a fish.com/live.

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:18.720
 You will see there the tickets are available for our British Library show. So check it

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:36.200
 out. Okay, that's it. That's all of the announcements on with the show.

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:41.680
 Hello and welcome to another episode of no such thing as a fish, a weekly podcast coming

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:47.440
 to you from four undisclosed locations in the UK. My name is Dan Schreiber. I am sitting

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:52.720
 here with James Harkin, Andrew Hunter Murray and Monica Heisei. And once again, we have

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:57.040
 gathered around the microphones with our four favorite facts from the last seven days.

00:01:57.040 --> 00:02:04.040
 And in a particular order here we go. Starting with fact number one, that is Monica.

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:10.080
 So my fact is that in ancient Hebrew times, men could get a divorce if their wife had

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:14.560
 been alone in a room with another man. And I was really interested in this fact because

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:21.000
 my divorce lawyer told me that this may still be true. I couldn't find anything backing

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:27.080
 up, but she basically said if he could prove that a man and a woman had been alone together

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:32.360
 in a room for more than an hour, it could be reasonably assumed legally that adultery

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:35.600
 had occurred. I think we should just say that we're not all in the same room at the

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:42.680
 moment. I think that's very important. No. I think people were a bit desperate because

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:48.200
 it used to be that you could only get divorced for five reasons, one of which was adultery.

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:51.840
 And so I think people just could stretch it a bit to prove you really just trying to get

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:56.560
 out. The history of what you needed to say or

00:02:56.560 --> 00:03:00.920
 allege or agree that you had been doing to get divorced is absolutely mad. For a long

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:06.400
 time it was only adultery or adultery was the only substantial grounds and then they

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:10.120
 introduced other ones a bit later on. But there was one rule where if one of you had

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:15.720
 committed adultery, then your partner could divorce you. But if you both had, they might

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:19.840
 not be able to because legally the divorce was kind of an acknowledgement that one person

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:24.840
 had committed wrong with the other was being like an eye for an eye and a shag for a shag.

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:30.120
 Yeah. And if you'd both done it, then you weren't allowed to lie saying, "Oh, I've committed

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:34.800
 adulterally." Sorry, that's a Ned Flanders version of adultery. You weren't allowed to

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:39.280
 lie saying you'd committed adultery. That's perjury. So they made it very, very difficult.

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:45.240
 Well, that's religion for you. And also it was a very specific definition as well. Adultery

00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:52.120
 legally is a married person having full sex with someone of the opposite gender. So if

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:56.640
 your husband had a gay affair and you were a woman, you couldn't sue him for divorce

00:03:56.640 --> 00:04:00.560
 on grounds of adultery, but you could sue him for unreasonable behavior.

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:06.320
 No, really? Yeah. Wow. This thing in the Jewish law, this is from the Mishnah, which is the

00:04:06.320 --> 00:04:12.120
 oldest written question of Jewish oral traditions. And the thing is that because if the woman

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:18.120
 had been in a room with another man, in theory, there can't be any other witnesses, right?

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:22.200
 Because it's basically one person's word against another person's word. And okay, you have

00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:25.960
 the perjury thing. But what they would do is they would give you the ordeal of bitter

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:31.040
 water. And this was to tell if you were telling the truth or not. So they would give the woman

00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:37.240
 some water with some dust in it. And it's not really clear what the dust is. It might

00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:42.720
 be bits of barley, it might be bits of something else. And the idea is if the woman drinks it

00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:47.360
 and the water is so bitter that she has to like spit it out. And then that proves that

00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:48.360
 she was in the wrong.

00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:49.360
 God, it's like witch trials.

00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:52.360
 A little bit like that. It's a trial by ordeal though, we can't let it.

00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:57.160
 I feel like I give myself this test every morning when I try for one sip of the water that's

00:04:57.160 --> 00:04:59.200
 been out by my bedside table all night.

00:04:59.200 --> 00:05:05.120
 I'll tell you, the worst divorce situation I read about in this research was to do with

00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:08.120
 if you were divorcing the king of Thailand.

00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:13.520
 The problem is that if you go to divorce the king of Thailand, you have to obviously accuse

00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:18.600
 the king of Thailand of reasons for the divorce. Unfortunately, by law in Thailand, you were

00:05:18.600 --> 00:05:24.080
 not allowed to accuse the king of anything. So when the current king's divorce case was

00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:28.320
 going on, I think he was the crown prince at the time, he went to court and he made

00:05:28.320 --> 00:05:33.120
 all these accusations against the wife. And the wife had to just say, "Yeah, he was fine.

00:05:33.120 --> 00:05:38.320
 Couldn't say anything. Couldn't defend himself." Yeah. So he obviously won.

00:05:38.320 --> 00:05:44.600
 I've got a fact about the king of Thailand. Do you remember the king and I, the play or

00:05:44.600 --> 00:05:45.600
 Mee's Coldplay?

00:05:45.600 --> 00:05:46.600
 Yeah.

00:05:46.600 --> 00:05:52.880
 It's about someone called Anna Leonowens who went to work for the king of Thailand. And

00:05:52.880 --> 00:05:58.400
 the real life Anna Leonowens was the great aunt of Boris Karloff who played, was it

00:05:58.400 --> 00:05:59.400
 Frankenstein or?

00:05:59.400 --> 00:06:00.400
 Yeah.

00:06:00.400 --> 00:06:03.400
 Yeah. Yeah. It's just a fact.

00:06:03.400 --> 00:06:09.480
 It's just two people you wouldn't expect to be related to each other, I reckon.

00:06:09.480 --> 00:06:14.080
 Yes. Yeah. That's very true. Like Ben Elton and Luke Longley are brothers-in-law. That would

00:06:14.080 --> 00:06:16.880
 mean nothing to no one except Australians. Yeah.

00:06:16.880 --> 00:06:19.200
 I've never heard of Luke. Who's Luke Longley?

00:06:19.200 --> 00:06:23.280
 One of the great Australian basketball players played with the Chicago Bulls in the Michael

00:06:23.280 --> 00:06:25.600
 Jordan period. He's a legend.

00:06:25.600 --> 00:06:30.480
 One of the great Australian basketball players. How big is this cohort?

00:06:30.480 --> 00:06:35.920
 There's three of them. And one of them is related by marriage, but not blood to Ben Elton.

00:06:35.920 --> 00:06:36.920
 Amazing.

00:06:36.920 --> 00:06:39.440
 Gosh. Why didn't you pick that as your headline fact this week, Darren?

00:06:39.440 --> 00:06:43.600
 I've been pitching it for nine years, you guys. Swatting it away every week. I found

00:06:43.600 --> 00:06:48.640
 a modern divorce story, which I can't believe that this is true, but it was reported in a

00:06:48.640 --> 00:06:56.960
 bunch of places. So this is to do with a Bosnian couple, Sana Klarek and her husband, Adnan.

00:06:56.960 --> 00:07:03.000
 And Adnan had not been happy in the marriage, and he started looking around for love and

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:07.840
 he went online. And so he started chatting to someone online. He used a fake name just

00:07:07.840 --> 00:07:13.000
 to make sure that no one could clock on to who he was. He met someone. He said, "I suddenly

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:16.600
 was in love again. It was beautiful. I thought I'd finally found someone who understands

00:07:16.600 --> 00:07:21.920
 me and who's in a similar situation in a bad marriage like I am." So they decided to meet

00:07:21.920 --> 00:07:29.080
 up. And they meet up and he sees a city in the spot where his online love should be.

00:07:29.080 --> 00:07:34.920
 His wife, who has also gone online, created a pseudonym, looked for love. They found each

00:07:34.920 --> 00:07:39.640
 other. And what's remarkable is that is how they found out that each of them were basically

00:07:39.640 --> 00:07:44.760
 cheating on each other and divorced off the back of it, despite falling back in love with

00:07:44.760 --> 00:07:48.900
 each other in this online scenario. They looked at it as negative.

00:07:48.900 --> 00:07:52.440
 Reverse Pina Colada song.

00:07:52.440 --> 00:07:56.200
 It's like a Richard Curtis film until the last sentence, isn't it?

00:07:56.200 --> 00:07:59.640
 Yeah. Yeah. Super plot twist in the end there.

00:07:59.640 --> 00:08:05.640
 There was a guy in New York. He was from New York anyway. And he divorced his wife in Dominican

00:08:05.640 --> 00:08:13.240
 Republic and she didn't find out for 22 years. So he filled in the form and got her to sign

00:08:13.240 --> 00:08:18.480
 something which she didn't know what she was signing. And he got an official divorce and

00:08:18.480 --> 00:08:23.080
 then she only found out when she got a letter through about the house that they owned and

00:08:23.080 --> 00:08:26.960
 her name wasn't on the deeds. And she sort of rang her lawyer and said, "What's going

00:08:26.960 --> 00:08:30.960
 on?" And he said, "Well, it turns out you're not married and you haven't been for 22 years."

00:08:30.960 --> 00:08:33.160
 But they can't have been living together.

00:08:33.160 --> 00:08:34.160
 Yeah.

00:08:34.160 --> 00:08:35.160
 What?

00:08:35.160 --> 00:08:38.960
 He just didn't tell her that they weren't married anymore. And what she said in the case

00:08:38.960 --> 00:08:43.520
 and I couldn't find out what in the end happened, but she said that she thought that he'd done

00:08:43.520 --> 00:08:48.280
 it deliberately so that he would own everything. If he left her in the future, she wouldn't

00:08:48.280 --> 00:08:49.880
 have any rights. That's what she said.

00:08:49.880 --> 00:08:52.000
 But then he stayed with her for decades?

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:56.560
 Yeah. Because apparently, I mean, I can't really speak for him. But what she said is

00:08:56.560 --> 00:09:02.200
 that the marriage was kind of happy, but he just did it as a kind of backup in case he

00:09:02.200 --> 00:09:03.200
 needed it in the future.

00:09:03.200 --> 00:09:04.200
 Oh my God.

00:09:04.200 --> 00:09:05.200
 Oh no.

00:09:05.200 --> 00:09:07.200
 That's about that, isn't it?

00:09:07.200 --> 00:09:13.720
 I became really obsessed with unreasonable behavior as a category. So they changed the

00:09:13.720 --> 00:09:20.240
 law in 2022 and now you could have a no fault divorce in the UK, which means that you don't

00:09:20.240 --> 00:09:24.240
 have to identify a guilty parting. You can just both agree that you want to dissolve

00:09:24.240 --> 00:09:28.880
 your marriage. But prior to that, you had to pick one of these five categories, kind

00:09:28.880 --> 00:09:33.360
 of whether or not there was something going on. And unreasonable behavior is such a very

00:09:33.360 --> 00:09:38.760
 capacious category. And I think 51% of women filing for divorce in this country, that was

00:09:38.760 --> 00:09:44.360
 their grounds. They're only 36% of men. And a lot of it has to do with gaming. People

00:09:44.360 --> 00:09:48.680
 were divorcing because either their husbands were gaming too often, but a lot of them like

00:09:48.680 --> 00:09:52.400
 a non-negligible portion, or people who are having digital affairs.

00:09:52.400 --> 00:09:55.800
 So you're basically meeting someone via, not by fortnight.

00:09:55.800 --> 00:10:02.560
 Your Sims avatar is having sex with someone else's Sim.

00:10:02.560 --> 00:10:07.600
 So what are the other limits to this, what was it called again?

00:10:07.600 --> 00:10:08.600
 Unreasonable behavior.

00:10:08.600 --> 00:10:09.600
 Unreasonable behavior.

00:10:09.600 --> 00:10:11.160
 What are you worried about, Dan?

00:10:11.160 --> 00:10:16.720
 Excessive Ben Elton memorabilia purchases from eBay. Is that, do I need to watch out?

00:10:16.720 --> 00:10:23.760
 I do think it's a very bendy category. It basically is like a prolonged commitment to behavior

00:10:23.760 --> 00:10:29.920
 that is a problem to the marriage. So that can include like actively building a life separate

00:10:29.920 --> 00:10:35.480
 to your partner. If you're developing too many not shared interests, or you're really

00:10:35.480 --> 00:10:41.040
 going hard on, I don't know, you have a new hobby and you're going away and pursuing rock

00:10:41.040 --> 00:10:45.840
 climbing all the time, and your partner is no interested in whatsoever. Eventually, after

00:10:45.840 --> 00:10:49.560
 a certain amount of rock climbing, I suppose it can become unreasonable.

00:10:49.560 --> 00:10:55.360
 I think reckless spending counts as well. If you're spending loads of money on Ben Elton

00:10:55.360 --> 00:10:56.360
 memorabilia, Dan.

00:10:56.360 --> 00:11:01.660
 I'm done. Yeah. Did you guys ever hear of the Brighton Quickie?

00:11:01.660 --> 00:11:05.200
 This is a divorce practice. And I've done a fair bit of reading about it. I can't quite

00:11:05.200 --> 00:11:09.680
 work out how real it was. Basically, in 1923, the law was changed saying you could petition

00:11:09.680 --> 00:11:13.760
 on adultery only. It was the only grounds for divorce. And that led to this thing where

00:11:13.760 --> 00:11:17.640
 it's kind of like Monica's original fact about the being in a room together. You would

00:11:17.640 --> 00:11:22.000
 go down, as the husband, you would agree to be the adulterer. You'd book a hotel room

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:26.800
 in Brighton because it's easy on the train from London. You spend the night there with

00:11:26.800 --> 00:11:31.120
 a woman you don't know. You don't have sex or anything. But there's a hotel receipt saying

00:11:31.120 --> 00:11:35.000
 you've booked a room for two the next morning. Maybe you're witnessed by the chambermaid.

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:37.760
 You could two pairs of shoes outside the door.

00:11:37.760 --> 00:11:43.440
 Exactly. Exactly. And there's then a small body of evidence that you can use to get your

00:11:43.440 --> 00:11:44.440
 divorce.

00:11:44.440 --> 00:11:45.440
 And then Tim's link back.

00:11:45.440 --> 00:11:50.040
 Yeah. You haven't even got to commit adultery, but you will be divorced in due course. But

00:11:50.040 --> 00:11:54.960
 I just can't tell how much it actually happened if at all. It's in a few novels and it's

00:11:54.960 --> 00:11:55.960
 written about at the time.

00:11:55.960 --> 00:11:56.960
 But it's not.

00:11:56.960 --> 00:12:00.800
 Also, how important is the chambermaid in this? Are all the rooms in this hotel packed

00:12:00.800 --> 00:12:03.800
 with people going for a Brighton quickie? And she's got to sort of be...

00:12:03.800 --> 00:12:04.800
 She's the witness.

00:12:04.800 --> 00:12:08.480
 Yeah. She's the witness for like 40 things a day where she has to...

00:12:08.480 --> 00:12:12.800
 Was that... Yeah. Then I saw the shoes outside that door. And then was it the pancakes?

00:12:12.800 --> 00:12:17.760
 I took a tea and they were on top of the bed. There was a pillow on the floor. So that's

00:12:17.760 --> 00:12:18.760
 suggestive.

00:12:18.760 --> 00:12:22.840
 I read that in Delaware and Colorado, you can get your marriage annulled if you did

00:12:22.840 --> 00:12:30.480
 it for a dare. But none of the other 48 states is that explicitly in the rules. Like probably

00:12:30.480 --> 00:12:33.600
 you still could get an annullment if you said that but you would have to go into something

00:12:33.600 --> 00:12:38.980
 else. But in those two states, it explicitly says it is illegal to get married on a dare.

00:12:38.980 --> 00:12:41.520
 I mean, all marriages are kind of a dare.

00:12:41.520 --> 00:12:42.520
 Oh, they're?

00:12:42.520 --> 00:12:43.520
 Yeah.

00:12:43.520 --> 00:12:44.520
 That's what a proposal is. It's a big dare.

00:12:44.520 --> 00:12:48.200
 Yeah. I dare you to stay with me until one or both of us dies.

00:12:48.200 --> 00:12:50.560
 I bet your wife is wishing she shows truth though.

00:12:50.560 --> 00:12:52.920
 Yeah. Every day.

00:12:52.920 --> 00:12:59.440
 I got a thing which is one of really classic Marvin Gaye albums, which was called Here,

00:12:59.440 --> 00:13:04.980
 My Dear, was made within a divorce proceeding whereby Marvin Gaye didn't quite have the

00:13:04.980 --> 00:13:10.360
 alimony that he needed to pay for his child. And so the agreement was the next album that

00:13:10.360 --> 00:13:15.120
 you do, your wife, who you're now divorcing, is going to get half of the money, royalties

00:13:15.120 --> 00:13:20.720
 and the upfront money from the album itself. And he decided, well, I don't want her making

00:13:20.720 --> 00:13:24.640
 any money. So I'm going to do a quickie album basically. I'm just going to not really do

00:13:24.640 --> 00:13:28.200
 anything good. It's going to come out and it's just going to be panned by the critics.

00:13:28.200 --> 00:13:33.000
 No one's going to like it. And then suddenly he got fascinated by the notion of this album

00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:38.000
 and ended up putting more heart and soul into this album, possibly than any of his other

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:41.720
 albums. He was really hands on. He wrote the lyrics. He never writes lyrics for his songs

00:13:41.720 --> 00:13:46.120
 according to the stuff that I was reading. He never really was hands on with playing

00:13:46.120 --> 00:13:51.060
 the piano. But in this album, he insisted on doing the lyrics, the piano. And it was

00:13:51.060 --> 00:13:55.160
 panned at the time, but it's been, it's one of those albums that's been reviewed by everyone

00:13:55.160 --> 00:14:00.880
 since, you know, the Rolling Stone has named it one of the best 500 albums ever made three

00:14:00.880 --> 00:14:04.800
 times in lists that they released. And it constantly appears on these lists now, but

00:14:04.800 --> 00:14:08.240
 it was a, it's a pure divorce album. Pretty cool.

00:14:08.240 --> 00:14:11.540
 What's the story of the producers, the film the producers done? We've just done, you've

00:14:11.540 --> 00:14:15.640
 given us a fact, which is the song Pina Colada, and now you've given us the film, the producers,

00:14:15.640 --> 00:14:17.480
 but you've translated it to being about Marvin Gaye.

00:14:17.480 --> 00:14:18.480
 No, no, no.

00:14:18.480 --> 00:14:20.000
 We see you. We see what you do.

00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:24.640
 They made it bad. He made this good during the process. The producers was bad.

00:14:24.640 --> 00:14:29.440
 I wonder at what point he decided to start making it good. Like if he's like, I'm going

00:14:29.440 --> 00:14:34.320
 to make it so bad. And then what day did he realize, oh, I'm actually very invested.

00:14:34.320 --> 00:14:35.920
 I'm really trying quite hard now.

00:14:35.920 --> 00:14:36.920
 Yeah. I don't know.

00:14:36.920 --> 00:14:39.720
 I guess if you're an artist, it's going to be really hard to go. I'll just put out a

00:14:39.720 --> 00:14:44.400
 shit album. Like that's, that must be a painful thing to do, to make a decision on.

00:14:44.400 --> 00:14:49.520
 I don't know. Some of them managed, don't they? But I think like, I think if he didn't

00:14:49.520 --> 00:14:53.920
 normally play piano and didn't normally write the lyrics, and then he started doing it,

00:14:53.920 --> 00:14:57.600
 he must have not normally done it because he didn't think he was as good as the people

00:14:57.600 --> 00:15:01.680
 who were doing it, right? Originally. And then when he started doing it, he's like, oh,

00:15:01.680 --> 00:15:02.680
 this is pretty good.

00:15:02.680 --> 00:15:08.040
 It's also a little bit self myth making. I tried to make an album which said I've made

00:15:08.040 --> 00:15:11.440
 one of the 500 greatest of all time.

00:15:11.440 --> 00:15:13.920
 Oh, that's just me.

00:15:13.920 --> 00:15:22.000
 Okay, it is time for fact number two. And that is Andy.

00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:27.480
 My fact is that the same fingers are responsible for the clicks in the Adams family theme,

00:15:27.480 --> 00:15:33.440
 the bongos in the Mission Impossible theme, and the xylophone in the Simpsons theme. The

00:15:33.440 --> 00:15:39.120
 same human fingers created three of the great artworks of the 20th century. I think it's

00:15:39.120 --> 00:15:41.520
 unbelievable. I think it's so great.

00:15:41.520 --> 00:15:44.160
 Would you say that you play the xylophone with your fingers?

00:15:44.160 --> 00:15:45.760
 I was going to question that.

00:15:45.760 --> 00:15:46.760
 Yeah.

00:15:46.760 --> 00:15:54.320
 His name was Woodfingers Richards and he, he was incredible. You know what fingers Richards,

00:15:54.320 --> 00:15:59.960
 when he clicked his fingers for the Adams family, he set himself on fire.

00:15:59.960 --> 00:16:04.000
 Emil Richards, he was a hero of percussion. I should say where I got this. It was via

00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:08.240
 a brilliant piece published each year by a guy called Tom Whitwell, which is a 52 things

00:16:08.240 --> 00:16:12.120
 you learn each year. I think I may have mentioned him before, either one or two or three years

00:16:12.120 --> 00:16:15.440
 ago, but anyway, it's a brilliant list. And this is one of the facts. I just couldn't

00:16:15.440 --> 00:16:21.880
 believe it. And Emil Richards, it turns out, born 1932, died 2019 in between those two dates,

00:16:21.880 --> 00:16:25.000
 at the most amazing musical career.

00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:26.000
 Yeah.

00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:31.440
 He played with Frank Sinatra. He toured with George Harrison. He was one of the most amazing

00:16:31.440 --> 00:16:34.800
 session musicians ever. The list of people who played with this just,

00:16:34.800 --> 00:16:39.840
 He played with Charlie Mingus, you know, he was proppered into the scene of jazz and blues

00:16:39.840 --> 00:16:43.960
 and, and then, yeah, as you say, he went on tour and also played on three George Harrison

00:16:43.960 --> 00:16:49.920
 albums. He was inducted into the Percussive Arts Society Hall of Fame in 1994. That's

00:16:49.920 --> 00:16:52.760
 a very hard Hall of Fame to get into.

00:16:52.760 --> 00:16:55.760
 Is it harder to get into than the Australian Basketball Hall of Fame?

00:16:55.760 --> 00:16:56.760
 Yes.

00:16:56.760 --> 00:17:01.480
 I imagine to get in, you have to do a special knock to get into the Percussive Art of Fame.

00:17:01.480 --> 00:17:04.160
 But no, yeah, what an extraordinary guy.

00:17:04.160 --> 00:17:08.580
 Yeah, it's amazing. Frank Zafer, Doris Day, The Beach Boys, The Bee Gees, Blondie, Ella

00:17:08.580 --> 00:17:13.040
 Fitzgerald, Marvin Gaye. I don't know if it was on the, the album.

00:17:13.040 --> 00:17:14.040
 Oh, imagine.

00:17:14.040 --> 00:17:17.320
 What? I think, I think Marvin did all his finger clicks on that album.

00:17:17.320 --> 00:17:23.160
 Right, okay. He was just incredible. I love this. His autobiography was called My Life

00:17:23.160 --> 00:17:24.160
 Behind Bars.

00:17:24.160 --> 00:17:25.160
 Oh, very nice.

00:17:25.160 --> 00:17:30.520
 Oh, you may have come across this in the course of your research. Do you, can you guess what

00:17:30.520 --> 00:17:33.080
 kind of animal he wanted to come back as in the next life?

00:17:33.080 --> 00:17:34.080
 Oh, I didn't see that.

00:17:34.080 --> 00:17:35.080
 I did not see that.

00:17:35.080 --> 00:17:38.120
 Something, something percussive. So, uh...

00:17:38.120 --> 00:17:39.120
 Woodpecker.

00:17:39.120 --> 00:17:42.240
 Oh, such a good, such a good guess. I wish it was that.

00:17:42.240 --> 00:17:43.920
 Imagine it's just totally unrelated.

00:17:43.920 --> 00:17:46.200
 No, no, no. It is related to his percussionist life.

00:17:46.200 --> 00:17:47.200
 Oh, it is.

00:17:47.200 --> 00:17:48.200
 He had an octopus.

00:17:48.200 --> 00:17:50.200
 Oh, so he can have more arms.

00:17:50.200 --> 00:17:53.160
 Woodpecker is better, actually, yeah.

00:17:53.160 --> 00:17:57.560
 Six of them are legs in an octopus.

00:17:57.560 --> 00:18:00.440
 He had the world's largest collection of percussive instruments.

00:18:00.440 --> 00:18:01.440
 Really?

00:18:01.440 --> 00:18:05.640
 This guy, yeah, he had 700, over 770.

00:18:05.640 --> 00:18:16.120
 I don't know if that's 771, maybe, but he, he had an angklung, a bulbul terang, a chimta,

00:18:16.120 --> 00:18:23.560
 a flapamba, a jengu, a mvira, and a pak havaj.

00:18:23.560 --> 00:18:27.280
 When I was looking him up, they said he's a, he plays the vibraphone and I went to look

00:18:27.280 --> 00:18:31.840
 up what a vibraphone was and the first thing that just said not to be confused with the

00:18:31.840 --> 00:18:32.840
 vibraphlap.

00:18:32.840 --> 00:18:35.240
 And what is that?

00:18:35.240 --> 00:18:36.240
 Always getting them fixed up.

00:18:36.240 --> 00:18:40.600
 The vibraphlap is, have you ever seen that instrument? It's like a piece of wire bent

00:18:40.600 --> 00:18:43.720
 into a U and there's a wooden ball on the end.

00:18:43.720 --> 00:18:49.880
 It hits the box. So that's a vibraphlap and a vibraphone is more, looks like a xylophone.

00:18:49.880 --> 00:18:51.560
 I don't know how you would confuse them.

00:18:51.560 --> 00:18:56.480
 They don't look at all alike and they're both so obscure that I feel like it's very unlikely

00:18:56.480 --> 00:19:00.500
 you'll be talking about one and not know what the other one is like either you're not talking

00:19:00.500 --> 00:19:06.840
 about these at all or there's no risk of you confusing the two.

00:19:06.840 --> 00:19:09.440
 So he did the Mission Impossible theme tune.

00:19:09.440 --> 00:19:14.680
 The bong goes on that and I was looking into the Mission Impossible theme tune generally.

00:19:14.680 --> 00:19:20.480
 So there's this fact, which is that the beat of the song was written to the Morse code

00:19:20.480 --> 00:19:22.200
 of M and I.

00:19:22.200 --> 00:19:25.320
 So can you give us the one it goes like for anyone who doesn't.

00:19:25.320 --> 00:19:26.600
 Andy, you're a bigger fan.

00:19:26.600 --> 00:19:28.400
 I always end up doing Bond by accident.

00:19:28.400 --> 00:19:29.400
 Can you do it quickly?

00:19:29.400 --> 00:19:33.960
 Do you mean the bit they go bam, bam, bam, bam, bam, bam, bam, bam, bam, bam, bam.

00:19:33.960 --> 00:19:34.960
 Yes.

00:19:34.960 --> 00:19:35.960
 Yeah.

00:19:35.960 --> 00:19:38.680
 So it's dash, dash, dot, dot is the thing for it.

00:19:38.680 --> 00:19:39.680
 Great.

00:19:39.680 --> 00:19:44.440
 But the guy who wrote it, Shifrin, he wrote that whole song he says in three minutes.

00:19:44.440 --> 00:19:45.440
 Wow.

00:19:45.440 --> 00:19:46.440
 Really?

00:19:46.440 --> 00:19:47.440
 Yeah.

00:19:47.440 --> 00:19:50.000
 You often hear that with a few musicians where they say I just banged that out and it just

00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:54.320
 came to me as a fully formed piece and that happened and that happened with Mission Impossible.

00:19:54.320 --> 00:19:55.320
 So that's quite cool.

00:19:55.320 --> 00:19:58.120
 And the same with the James Bond theme.

00:19:58.120 --> 00:20:03.600
 That wasn't written in a quick time, but if by a guy called Monty Norman and he actually,

00:20:03.600 --> 00:20:08.800
 which is, I really like this, he was hired by the Bond people to come up specifically

00:20:08.800 --> 00:20:09.800
 with this theme.

00:20:09.800 --> 00:20:15.200
 And they took him out to Jamaica on a holiday and he met Connery out there and Ursula Andres.

00:20:15.200 --> 00:20:17.200
 Because they were filming Dr. No.

00:20:17.200 --> 00:20:19.240
 Yeah, they were filming Dr. No, the first one out there.

00:20:19.240 --> 00:20:22.120
 And so he was brought to meet them all and get a vibe of it.

00:20:22.120 --> 00:20:26.680
 And he ended up just using a previous tune that he had written for a completely different

00:20:26.680 --> 00:20:28.360
 adaption that never got used.

00:20:28.360 --> 00:20:34.040
 It was a stage production of VS Naples' novel, A House for Mr. Biswas.

00:20:34.040 --> 00:20:38.160
 That's the original James Bond theme and it was played on Sitar.

00:20:38.160 --> 00:20:43.160
 It's the other one that goes da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, oh, because I know the original

00:20:43.160 --> 00:20:48.720
 lyrics about something like, I was born with an unfortunate sneeze and yes, that's it.

00:20:48.720 --> 00:20:52.160
 My parents said that I was made the wrong way around.

00:20:52.160 --> 00:20:54.520
 Oh my God.

00:20:54.520 --> 00:20:58.520
 This is a bigger repurpose than Candle in the Wind.

00:20:58.520 --> 00:21:00.840
 This is a big shift.

00:21:00.840 --> 00:21:01.840
 So strange.

00:21:01.840 --> 00:21:07.880
 And I think at the end of the song, he sneezes so much that he falls into a lay cuss of that

00:21:07.880 --> 00:21:08.880
 tune.

00:21:08.880 --> 00:21:09.880
 Oh, right.

00:21:09.880 --> 00:21:10.880
 Wow.

00:21:10.880 --> 00:21:13.120
 This guy, Monty Norman, he also wrote an autobiography.

00:21:13.120 --> 00:21:15.280
 So Life Behind Bar is a very good title.

00:21:15.280 --> 00:21:18.520
 Do you know, Andy, you look like you might know the title of his autobiography.

00:21:18.520 --> 00:21:19.520
 No, I don't.

00:21:19.520 --> 00:21:20.960
 Is it Musical and James Bond theme?

00:21:20.960 --> 00:21:21.960
 No.

00:21:21.960 --> 00:21:22.960
 Well, I'm not going to get it.

00:21:22.960 --> 00:21:26.160
 It was called A Walking Stick Full of Bagels.

00:21:26.160 --> 00:21:27.160
 Okay.

00:21:27.160 --> 00:21:28.160
 You know that.

00:21:28.160 --> 00:21:30.160
 Without knowing the context, that is not a good title for it.

00:21:30.160 --> 00:21:32.720
 I think that must have been a classic phrase back in the day.

00:21:32.720 --> 00:21:34.480
 You're like a walking stick full of bagels.

00:21:34.480 --> 00:21:35.640
 And what does that mean?

00:21:35.640 --> 00:21:37.360
 How would a stick be full of anything?

00:21:37.360 --> 00:21:38.360
 There we go.

00:21:38.360 --> 00:21:39.360
 Yeah.

00:21:39.360 --> 00:21:40.360
 So many questions.

00:21:40.360 --> 00:21:43.240
 I bet they were all answered in the unpublished autobiography and we are yet to find out.

00:21:43.240 --> 00:21:49.160
 I think the best autobiography title I've ever heard was Tori Spelling's Autobiography,

00:21:49.160 --> 00:21:51.160
 Storytelling by Tori Spelling.

00:21:51.160 --> 00:21:52.160
 Genius.

00:21:52.160 --> 00:21:53.160
 Really strong title.

00:21:53.160 --> 00:21:54.160
 I've got it.

00:21:54.160 --> 00:21:55.160
 I got it off that title.

00:21:55.160 --> 00:21:58.160
 But that doesn't go down well in the divorce case.

00:21:58.160 --> 00:21:59.160
 Tori Spelling's Autobiography.

00:21:59.160 --> 00:22:07.160
 Have you guys heard of the village of Kong Thong in northeast India?

00:22:07.160 --> 00:22:08.160
 No.

00:22:08.160 --> 00:22:12.400
 This is a village where every child is given a theme tune.

00:22:12.400 --> 00:22:13.400
 Oh, cool.

00:22:13.400 --> 00:22:14.920
 So it's a little village.

00:22:14.920 --> 00:22:16.960
 It's really cut off from the rest of India.

00:22:16.960 --> 00:22:18.440
 I don't think you can get that by car.

00:22:18.440 --> 00:22:20.880
 I think you can get that by boat.

00:22:20.880 --> 00:22:26.160
 It's in the middle of a jungle and people would forage for broom grass, which they would

00:22:26.160 --> 00:22:27.280
 sell on.

00:22:27.280 --> 00:22:31.120
 And so a lot of the time you would spend in the jungle sort of walking around probably

00:22:31.120 --> 00:22:32.120
 alone.

00:22:32.120 --> 00:22:36.800
 And the thing is in the jungle is quite hard to hear people for long distances because

00:22:36.800 --> 00:22:39.200
 it all gets soaked in by the trees.

00:22:39.200 --> 00:22:43.800
 And so they came up with this different way of telling people you're around by having

00:22:43.800 --> 00:22:47.560
 a different tune that you would whistle or you would shout or whatever.

00:22:47.560 --> 00:22:52.200
 And so when you're born, you get your theme tune and then for the rest of your life, whenever

00:22:52.200 --> 00:22:55.080
 you're in the jungle, people will make this little doodoo doodoo doodoo.

00:22:55.080 --> 00:22:57.080
 You'd be like, oh, that's me.

00:22:57.080 --> 00:22:58.080
 That was the Simpsons.

00:22:58.080 --> 00:22:59.080
 So cool.

00:22:59.080 --> 00:23:00.080
 Yeah.

00:23:00.080 --> 00:23:01.080
 Yeah.

00:23:01.080 --> 00:23:05.880
 I think lawyers will be in touch with that kid.

00:23:05.880 --> 00:23:09.160
 He was from the Simpson family of Kong Thong.

00:23:09.160 --> 00:23:11.080
 That is so cool, isn't it?

00:23:11.080 --> 00:23:12.080
 That's awesome.

00:23:12.080 --> 00:23:16.320
 Unfortunately, it's kind of dying out because people now will connect with each other using

00:23:16.320 --> 00:23:19.680
 mobile phones so they don't need these theme tunes so much.

00:23:19.680 --> 00:23:22.720
 Yes, again, the internet's ruined it all.

00:23:22.720 --> 00:23:28.960
 I'm having a quick think about songs that use the old Panda Rooze as a kind of iconic

00:23:28.960 --> 00:23:29.960
 bit of it.

00:23:29.960 --> 00:23:34.240
 And obviously, if you're thinking theme tunes, the Friends theme tune, I'll be there for

00:23:34.240 --> 00:23:36.080
 you by the Rem Brands.

00:23:36.080 --> 00:23:38.200
 There's like a clapping bit, right?

00:23:38.200 --> 00:23:39.200
 Yeah.

00:23:39.200 --> 00:23:40.200
 So it's four claps.

00:23:40.200 --> 00:23:43.520
 Apparently, there's a bit of controversy because Courtney Cox did five claps on a TV

00:23:43.520 --> 00:23:46.280
 show once and it sent the writers of the song mad.

00:23:46.280 --> 00:23:51.480
 But the song, I'll be there for you, it was actually a song composed specifically for

00:23:51.480 --> 00:23:55.560
 the TV show and the Rem Brands had very minimal input into the writing itself.

00:23:55.560 --> 00:24:02.000
 It was the actual creators of Friends who wrote the song and it proved to be such an

00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:06.240
 iconic theme tune that everyone was begging for it to be released in the...

00:24:06.240 --> 00:24:09.320
 Yeah, I bought it in the chance when it came out.

00:24:09.320 --> 00:24:14.120
 So what that was was they had to go into a studio and write a whole song because there

00:24:14.120 --> 00:24:15.600
 wasn't a whole song.

00:24:15.600 --> 00:24:17.760
 It was only the theme tune bit of the song.

00:24:17.760 --> 00:24:19.800
 They needed two more verses to be added in.

00:24:19.800 --> 00:24:20.800
 Oh, really?

00:24:20.800 --> 00:24:21.800
 Yeah.

00:24:21.800 --> 00:24:25.320
 So it was a backwards constructed full song that ended up coming out.

00:24:25.320 --> 00:24:26.320
 That's so interesting.

00:24:26.320 --> 00:24:27.320
 So it was 40 seconds long.

00:24:27.320 --> 00:24:31.320
 There was like a time in the 90s when all the theme tunes used to come out and you could

00:24:31.320 --> 00:24:35.480
 buy them for the charts like the exfiles did around that time as well.

00:24:35.480 --> 00:24:39.080
 And they all did quite well in the charts just because people thought, oh, I like that

00:24:39.080 --> 00:24:40.080
 song.

00:24:40.080 --> 00:24:41.080
 Yeah.

00:24:41.080 --> 00:24:42.080
 I love...

00:24:42.080 --> 00:24:43.080
 I mean, the exfiles is my favorite theme tune of all time.

00:24:43.080 --> 00:24:44.800
 And it turns out, so the guy who composed that's called...

00:24:44.800 --> 00:24:45.800
 Mark Snow?

00:24:45.800 --> 00:24:46.960
 Yeah, Mark Snow.

00:24:46.960 --> 00:24:49.360
 And David DeColvany claims, I think this is tongue in cheek.

00:24:49.360 --> 00:24:53.920
 I mean, it completely is tongue in cheek, but he says there were lyrics to the exfiles

00:24:53.920 --> 00:24:58.760
 theme tune by Mark Snow and these are the lyrics.

00:24:58.760 --> 00:25:05.400
 The exfiles is a show, show, show, show, show, with music by Mark Snow, snow, snow, snow.

00:25:05.400 --> 00:25:10.480
 Those are the only two lyrics that we know of according to DeColvany.

00:25:10.480 --> 00:25:13.040
 Do you guys know what composers of TV theme tunes hate?

00:25:13.040 --> 00:25:14.040
 I guess.

00:25:14.040 --> 00:25:21.120
 Oh, when on TV shows, when the continuity announcer goes next up on BBC Three.

00:25:21.120 --> 00:25:24.200
 That's a really good point.

00:25:24.200 --> 00:25:29.640
 I'm specifically talking about the skip intro button, which is very controversial.

00:25:29.640 --> 00:25:34.680
 They get furious, those guys and gals, about the skip intro because Netflix found out that

00:25:34.680 --> 00:25:37.680
 users were frequently fast forwarding a bit because, you know, if you're watching three

00:25:37.680 --> 00:25:40.560
 episodes in a night, you don't want to see the theme tune three times.

00:25:40.560 --> 00:25:45.960
 So Netflix claims, I can't quite believe this, skip intro is pressed 136 million times a

00:25:45.960 --> 00:25:51.440
 day, which cumulatively saves 130 years of human time.

00:25:51.440 --> 00:25:57.200
 We never, especially the shows where they've put some proper effort into the, into the

00:25:57.200 --> 00:25:58.200
 intros.

00:25:58.200 --> 00:26:00.760
 I think you lose quite a lot from not having those intros.

00:26:00.760 --> 00:26:04.840
 Can you imagine watching Game of Thrones and not having that amazing theme tune with

00:26:04.840 --> 00:26:09.560
 all the stuff happening and then just going straight into the shaggy nuts?

00:26:09.560 --> 00:26:10.560
 Yeah, exactly.

00:26:10.560 --> 00:26:11.560
 Yeah.

00:26:11.560 --> 00:26:12.560
 It really sets the vibe.

00:26:12.560 --> 00:26:17.440
 I think grooving to the soprano's theme is like maybe 30% of what I like about watching

00:26:17.440 --> 00:26:18.440
 the show.

00:26:18.440 --> 00:26:22.920
 Obviously the rest of the other 70% is that it's groundbreaking, beautiful human drama.

00:26:22.920 --> 00:26:25.000
 But the theme tune is also up there.

00:26:25.000 --> 00:26:26.000
 It's a bop.

00:26:26.000 --> 00:26:27.000
 I agree.

00:26:27.000 --> 00:26:28.100
 We stand up in our house.

00:26:28.100 --> 00:26:30.440
 We stand in silence for every theme tune.

00:26:30.440 --> 00:26:32.960
 It's a huge respect in this household.

00:26:32.960 --> 00:26:36.280
 Monica, aren't you show running on a show at the moment?

00:26:36.280 --> 00:26:38.840
 I just finished show running on a show.

00:26:38.840 --> 00:26:40.880
 Are you going to get to pick the theme tune?

00:26:40.880 --> 00:26:44.000
 I think we're going to have like proper opening titles.

00:26:44.000 --> 00:26:46.640
 So we're going to have to do a whole, you're going to have to figure out a whole thing.

00:26:46.640 --> 00:26:47.640
 Yeah.

00:26:47.640 --> 00:26:50.760
 I've really been shown my own limitations in this area because my description is like,

00:26:50.760 --> 00:26:53.200
 I want it to sound cool.

00:26:53.200 --> 00:26:58.200
 No, out of their fiend back home.

00:26:58.200 --> 00:27:00.040
 Well, I got, I got some advice for you, Monica.

00:27:00.040 --> 00:27:05.140
 If you're working with the sound person, do a, do a secret thing here, which is do actually

00:27:05.140 --> 00:27:11.080
 write lyrics to whatever the theme tune is, but don't put them out because you could then

00:27:11.080 --> 00:27:13.640
 claim 50% royalties on the song.

00:27:13.640 --> 00:27:16.240
 This is what Jean Roddenberry did with Star Trek.

00:27:16.240 --> 00:27:18.400
 He wrote lyrics for the Star Trek song.

00:27:18.400 --> 00:27:20.120
 They never use them.

00:27:20.120 --> 00:27:23.480
 And anytime a royalty check came in, he was a co-writer of the song.

00:27:23.480 --> 00:27:25.680
 So he got 50% of everything.

00:27:25.680 --> 00:27:27.440
 And the song suicide is painless.

00:27:27.440 --> 00:27:28.920
 The mash theme tune.

00:27:28.920 --> 00:27:34.880
 It was used in the Robert Altman movie commissioned specifically for that movie by Robert Altman.

00:27:34.880 --> 00:27:37.660
 And he tried to write the lyrics for it, couldn't crack it.

00:27:37.660 --> 00:27:42.940
 And so he asked his son, Michael, who was 15 years old at the time, to write the lyrics.

00:27:42.940 --> 00:27:44.580
 So Michael did that.

00:27:44.580 --> 00:27:49.260
 And as a result of that song not only being used in the movie, but then the long running

00:27:49.260 --> 00:27:54.460
 TV show with Alan Alder, he says, Altman says that he made $70,000 for directing that

00:27:54.460 --> 00:27:55.460
 movie.

00:27:55.460 --> 00:28:00.100
 And his son has earned more than a million dollars over the years just from that being

00:28:00.100 --> 00:28:01.100
 sold.

00:28:01.100 --> 00:28:04.020
 Those lyrics are good though, aren't they, for suicide is painless.

00:28:04.020 --> 00:28:09.200
 But G. Roddenberry, is he not just stealing half of the credit?

00:28:09.200 --> 00:28:10.200
 Yeah.

00:28:10.200 --> 00:28:11.200
 It feels like it.

00:28:11.200 --> 00:28:14.840
 It feels like the workers and the musicians who have done all this work and he's just

00:28:14.840 --> 00:28:17.840
 like, well, I'll pretend that I've written some lyrics and take half the money.

00:28:17.840 --> 00:28:19.240
 It's quite cheeky.

00:28:19.240 --> 00:28:20.240
 It's very cheeky.

00:28:20.240 --> 00:28:22.020
 Hey, that's the business we're in, guys.

00:28:22.020 --> 00:28:23.020
 And Monica.

00:28:23.020 --> 00:28:24.020
 Is it?

00:28:24.020 --> 00:28:25.020
 Oh.

00:28:25.020 --> 00:28:26.020
 That's Hollywood, baby.

00:28:26.020 --> 00:28:27.020
 Gosh.

00:28:27.020 --> 00:28:28.020
 Business is business.

00:28:28.020 --> 00:28:33.520
 Just quickly, Ed Sheeran has written the theme tune to James Bond, despite no one having

00:28:33.520 --> 00:28:37.380
 requested that he do that, which I think is quite sweet.

00:28:37.380 --> 00:28:39.660
 I think that's a very Ed Sheeran thing to do.

00:28:39.660 --> 00:28:44.460
 But that's, isn't that, I would say that when a new Bond comes out, people submit songs.

00:28:44.460 --> 00:28:45.700
 That's how that's always worked.

00:28:45.700 --> 00:28:46.700
 No, it's not.

00:28:46.700 --> 00:28:47.700
 You don't send in.

00:28:47.700 --> 00:28:51.300
 There are so many songs that are out that are rejected Bond songs by bands that submitted

00:28:51.300 --> 00:28:53.980
 a song that didn't get used, which they then use.

00:28:53.980 --> 00:28:54.980
 Is there a process?

00:28:54.980 --> 00:28:57.340
 Is there an open process by which, I mean, could we submit one?

00:28:57.340 --> 00:28:58.340
 Yeah.

00:28:58.340 --> 00:28:59.340
 That's what I was thinking.

00:28:59.340 --> 00:29:00.340
 Did they accept anything?

00:29:00.340 --> 00:29:01.340
 They've...

00:29:01.340 --> 00:29:02.340
 That can't be true.

00:29:02.340 --> 00:29:04.320
 I thought that they would commission a cool art.

00:29:04.320 --> 00:29:06.820
 It can't be like a bake-off.

00:29:06.820 --> 00:29:09.420
 The last film, they asked Billie Eilish to do...

00:29:09.420 --> 00:29:10.420
 Yeah.

00:29:10.420 --> 00:29:11.420
 No, she just got lucky.

00:29:11.420 --> 00:29:13.420
 She just happens to have the best what they said in a million.

00:29:13.420 --> 00:29:14.420
 Yeah.

00:29:14.420 --> 00:29:15.420
 Wow.

00:29:15.420 --> 00:29:16.420
 Exactly.

00:29:16.420 --> 00:29:17.420
 And hers just happens to be the best one.

00:29:17.420 --> 00:29:18.420
 And they listen to them blind as well.

00:29:18.420 --> 00:29:19.420
 Yeah.

00:29:19.420 --> 00:29:20.420
 They don't, you know, they don't prejudice themselves.

00:29:20.420 --> 00:29:21.420
 It's like the voice.

00:29:21.420 --> 00:29:22.420
 It's like the voice.

00:29:22.420 --> 00:29:23.420
 It could be anyone.

00:29:23.420 --> 00:29:24.420
 But I can't be true, Dan.

00:29:24.420 --> 00:29:25.420
 It can't be true.

00:29:25.420 --> 00:29:27.940
 Because they always pick the trendiest person in the world at the time, don't they?

00:29:27.940 --> 00:29:28.940
 No, I mean...

00:29:28.940 --> 00:29:31.420
 And Ed Sheeran has consistently been the second trendiest person in the world.

00:29:31.420 --> 00:29:33.420
 She just keeps missing it.

00:29:33.420 --> 00:29:36.500
 The reason I say it is I know that Radiohead had a rejected Bond song.

00:29:36.500 --> 00:29:38.900
 So I'm trying to work back from there.

00:29:38.900 --> 00:29:41.540
 And I'm pretty sure Johnny Cash had one as well.

00:29:41.540 --> 00:29:43.260
 And I think this is a thing.

00:29:43.260 --> 00:29:44.260
 Yeah.

00:29:44.260 --> 00:29:45.260
 But I can't say for sure.

00:29:45.260 --> 00:29:46.260
 Wow.

00:29:46.260 --> 00:29:49.940
 Maybe they asked people to tender for it, rather than anyone being able to send stuff in.

00:29:49.940 --> 00:29:50.940
 Oh, yeah.

00:29:50.940 --> 00:29:51.940
 I think they sent...

00:29:51.940 --> 00:29:53.260
 I think they asked, like, a group of people.

00:29:53.260 --> 00:29:54.540
 I don't think it is open.

00:29:54.540 --> 00:29:55.540
 Right.

00:29:55.540 --> 00:29:56.540
 Yeah.

00:29:56.540 --> 00:29:57.540
 It's not quite as open as that.

00:29:57.540 --> 00:29:58.540
 Open season.

00:29:58.540 --> 00:29:59.540
 Because you'd see...

00:29:59.540 --> 00:30:00.540
 There'd be a thing every three years, wouldn't there?

00:30:00.540 --> 00:30:01.540
 Yeah, exactly.

00:30:01.540 --> 00:30:04.940
 Have you guys heard of Dusan Sestic?

00:30:04.940 --> 00:30:07.940
 He's a composer of the Bosnian National Anthem.

00:30:07.940 --> 00:30:09.580
 We spoke about Bosnia earlier.

00:30:09.580 --> 00:30:14.700
 He entered the competition to do the Bosnian National Anthem.

00:30:14.700 --> 00:30:15.860
 He did really want to win.

00:30:15.860 --> 00:30:18.180
 He just wanted to get, like, second or third place.

00:30:18.180 --> 00:30:19.380
 There was money for it.

00:30:19.380 --> 00:30:21.900
 He, like, was quite into the old Yugoslavia.

00:30:21.900 --> 00:30:23.860
 He didn't really care about the new Bosnia.

00:30:23.860 --> 00:30:27.180
 But he thought, "I'll get some money out of it because I'm a decent composer."

00:30:27.180 --> 00:30:31.820
 Anyway, he won and he wrote the National Anthem for Bosnia.

00:30:31.820 --> 00:30:36.620
 And then, in 2009, someone noticed that it was remarkably similar to the theme tune of

00:30:36.620 --> 00:30:40.900
 National Lampoon's Animal House, the 1978 movie.

00:30:40.900 --> 00:30:41.900
 Right.

00:30:41.900 --> 00:30:45.700
 And when you listen to the both, they are almost identical.

00:30:45.700 --> 00:30:48.260
 Like, there is no difference whatsoever.

00:30:48.260 --> 00:30:53.140
 But, bless him, he went on TV and they were all like, "Well, how come you made our National

00:30:53.140 --> 00:30:54.140
 Lampoon the theme tune?"

00:30:54.140 --> 00:30:56.340
 She said, "That's the Lampoon's Animal House."

00:30:56.340 --> 00:31:00.180
 And he said, "Oh, maybe as a young man, I heard it and it kind of stuck in my head.

00:31:00.180 --> 00:31:02.700
 But I didn't deliberately plagiarise it.

00:31:02.700 --> 00:31:03.700
 It just so happened."

00:31:03.700 --> 00:31:04.700
 That is brilliant.

00:31:04.700 --> 00:31:05.700
 Yeah.

00:31:05.700 --> 00:31:10.580
 This is the problem with big national policies being decided by right-in contest.

00:31:10.580 --> 00:31:14.500
 This is why Canadian legal tender is called the Looney and the Tooney.

00:31:14.500 --> 00:31:17.020
 Oh, what?

00:31:17.020 --> 00:31:19.820
 The $1 coin has a loon on it, so it's called the Looney.

00:31:19.820 --> 00:31:23.860
 And then they had a contest to name the $2 coin, which has a polar bear on it.

00:31:23.860 --> 00:31:26.500
 And the winning entry was the Tooney.

00:31:26.500 --> 00:31:28.420
 And now that is actually what we call it.

00:31:28.420 --> 00:31:32.820
 And it just makes us sound like a joke country.

00:31:32.820 --> 00:31:36.700
 Without knowing the other options, Monica, I do think Tooney's quite good.

00:31:36.700 --> 00:31:39.460
 I think there's a bit of Bodie McBoatface to it.

00:31:39.460 --> 00:31:40.460
 Yeah, yeah.

00:31:40.460 --> 00:31:41.460
 We can't speak.

00:31:41.460 --> 00:31:42.460
 Haven't they also...

00:31:42.460 --> 00:31:43.460
 The Looney and the Tooney.

00:31:43.460 --> 00:31:44.460
 Yeah, it works.

00:31:44.460 --> 00:31:53.540
 Haven't they recently, just while we're talking about money and having mentioned Star Trek,

00:31:53.540 --> 00:31:58.220
 there was the thing where you would spockify your Canadian dollar, right?

00:31:58.220 --> 00:32:03.180
 The guy who was on the picture looks so similar to Leonardo Nimoy from Star Trek that you

00:32:03.180 --> 00:32:06.020
 would draw spockiers on him and you would draw the hair, basically.

00:32:06.020 --> 00:32:07.420
 Yes, it was called spocking.

00:32:07.420 --> 00:32:08.420
 Spocking.

00:32:08.420 --> 00:32:14.420
 And the Bank of Canada had to issue a statement saying that it was legal to do but inappropriate.

00:32:14.420 --> 00:32:21.060
 And I think they've, from what I read, they've changed his image now on the bill.

00:32:21.060 --> 00:32:22.060
 Is that right?

00:32:22.060 --> 00:32:25.780
 There's a new version of the same guy just so it's less spockable.

00:32:25.780 --> 00:32:26.780
 Yeah.

00:32:26.780 --> 00:32:31.020
 I think if you draw that spock on any note, then Chee Roddenberry owns half your money.

00:32:31.020 --> 00:32:36.180
 Yeah, and then a spock, that was spockspersonic for another agency in Canada, an angel agency

00:32:36.180 --> 00:32:40.380
 said to the Bank of Canada, "This is fine as you say it's perfectly legal and I'm sure

00:32:40.380 --> 00:32:43.380
 Sir Wilfrid Laurier would get it.

00:32:43.380 --> 00:32:46.820
 Who's the man pictured off the bill who died in 1919."

00:32:46.820 --> 00:32:53.780
 I've just got one more theme tune I quickly want to bring up, which is The Fresh Prince

00:32:53.780 --> 00:32:54.860
 of Bel Air.

00:32:54.860 --> 00:32:57.500
 So we all know that theme tune.

00:32:57.500 --> 00:33:03.180
 It's a Kraken song by Will Smith and it was a song that he wrote despite not being necessarily

00:33:03.180 --> 00:33:04.420
 asked to write it at the time.

00:33:04.420 --> 00:33:07.580
 He kind of just did it and he showed it to, I believe it was Quincy Jones who was doing

00:33:07.580 --> 00:33:11.060
 the music for the show and they said, "Yeah, you can go and do it."

00:33:11.060 --> 00:33:15.580
 Obviously it's a massive hit and when it was released in 1992 as a single, but here's

00:33:15.580 --> 00:33:19.740
 the thing, I don't know if James, you bought singles as you were saying back in the day.

00:33:19.740 --> 00:33:25.340
 In 1992, The Fresh Prince of Bel Air theme tune was only released exclusively in the Netherlands

00:33:25.340 --> 00:33:27.860
 and Spain and that's where it charted.

00:33:27.860 --> 00:33:28.860
 That's it.

00:33:28.860 --> 00:33:32.340
 That's really, because when you said that, I thought to myself, how come I didn't buy

00:33:32.340 --> 00:33:33.340
 that?

00:33:33.340 --> 00:33:36.500
 Like I was so sure that I would, if I was around at the time I would have bought it because

00:33:36.500 --> 00:33:40.420
 I bought Wicky Wicky Wild Wild West or whatever it was by Will Smith.

00:33:40.420 --> 00:33:41.420
 Great song.

00:33:41.420 --> 00:33:44.820
 Yeah, I bought all his other crap, so I was really surprised.

00:33:44.820 --> 00:33:47.620
 James, did you buy Willenium?

00:33:47.620 --> 00:33:48.620
 That was a great album.

00:33:48.620 --> 00:33:49.620
 Oh, an album.

00:33:49.620 --> 00:33:51.180
 No, I was more of a singles buyer really.

00:33:51.180 --> 00:33:54.180
 It's not a good album then.

00:33:54.180 --> 00:34:00.700
 I'm sorry, I think enough time has passed that I'm able to have a pop at Willenium.

00:34:00.700 --> 00:34:07.180
 What's the name of that album out of your dash?

00:34:07.180 --> 00:34:13.460
 Okay, it is time for fact number three and that is my fact.

00:34:13.460 --> 00:34:19.660
 My fact this week is that in 2024, the first ever theater production of Dracula will celebrate

00:34:19.660 --> 00:34:21.940
 its hundredth anniversary.

00:34:21.940 --> 00:34:26.420
 Unfortunately, fans can't celebrate it in the venue it was performed in because it's

00:34:26.420 --> 00:34:33.620
 currently occupied by an over 18s adult themed crazy golf course called the House of Holes.

00:34:33.620 --> 00:34:36.620
 Filthy.

00:34:36.620 --> 00:34:43.220
 This is in Darby, a city in the UK and I was there recently on the weekend for a game of

00:34:43.220 --> 00:34:44.220
 bitty golf.

00:34:44.220 --> 00:34:47.620
 How was your quick round?

00:34:47.620 --> 00:34:52.860
 I was there doing a ghost story festival and afterwards I was hanging out with this really

00:34:52.860 --> 00:34:56.380
 cool guy called Chris Horton and he said I've got a fish fact for you.

00:34:56.380 --> 00:35:01.140
 And he told me he'd passed the House of Holes and made him laugh and so yeah, so it is a

00:35:01.140 --> 00:35:04.460
 very well known theater as well as called the Grand Theater.

00:35:04.460 --> 00:35:08.700
 Then it just got repurposed over the years to be something new and there was restaurants

00:35:08.700 --> 00:35:13.580
 in its place and so on and now there is this amazing crazy golf.

00:35:13.580 --> 00:35:14.740
 The House of Holes.

00:35:14.740 --> 00:35:15.740
 Yeah.

00:35:15.740 --> 00:35:19.860
 Can I just, I'm sure we'll talk more about crazy or can I talk specifically about the

00:35:19.860 --> 00:35:21.380
 House of Holes and Darby.

00:35:21.380 --> 00:35:22.380
 Yeah, sure.

00:35:22.380 --> 00:35:24.340
 I don't mean to cast any experts on it.

00:35:24.340 --> 00:35:25.860
 I don't think it's terribly erotic.

00:35:25.860 --> 00:35:26.860
 It doesn't seem to be from the website.

00:35:26.860 --> 00:35:27.860
 Oh, really?

00:35:27.860 --> 00:35:29.260
 It seems like a lot of it just seems to be novelty.

00:35:29.260 --> 00:35:32.740
 Because I think that people at home, some people at home will have an image in their

00:35:32.740 --> 00:35:35.300
 heads of what it is.

00:35:35.300 --> 00:35:36.300
 Yeah.

00:35:36.300 --> 00:35:38.900
 But let's sort of give context then through images.

00:35:38.900 --> 00:35:44.140
 One of the holes, you have to hit the ball through a bunch of standing dildos for example.

00:35:44.140 --> 00:35:46.540
 Yes, I'm not saying it's totally erotic.

00:35:46.540 --> 00:35:52.660
 There's another one where for some reason there's a lot of blow-up dolls that are uninflated

00:35:52.660 --> 00:35:57.420
 hanging on washing lines, just hanging in the vicinity of the hole itself.

00:35:57.420 --> 00:36:01.660
 Yeah, the area where you play pool, because you know these places, indoor places have

00:36:01.660 --> 00:36:03.300
 like, you can play arcades and stuff.

00:36:03.300 --> 00:36:07.020
 The area where you play pool is called anal butt.

00:36:07.020 --> 00:36:08.020
 What?

00:36:08.020 --> 00:36:14.260
 Yeah, and anal has a four instead of the second A in anal, so AN4L butt.

00:36:14.260 --> 00:36:16.260
 Well, it's not got to do with pool.

00:36:16.260 --> 00:36:17.260
 What does that mean?

00:36:17.260 --> 00:36:18.260
 Not quite sure.

00:36:18.260 --> 00:36:19.260
 I couldn't get to the bottom of that one.

00:36:19.260 --> 00:36:20.260
 But it's there.

00:36:20.260 --> 00:36:26.220
 Surely the phrase anal and butt are sort of achieving the same, feeling a little redundant

00:36:26.220 --> 00:36:27.220
 to me personally.

00:36:27.220 --> 00:36:30.100
 It's definitely a redundant adjective, isn't it?

00:36:30.100 --> 00:36:33.540
 How's your butt, well, it's very anal.

00:36:33.540 --> 00:36:38.780
 But I don't know what's in the water in Derby, but there was a newspaper piece a couple of

00:36:38.780 --> 00:36:39.780
 months ago.

00:36:39.780 --> 00:36:45.660
 Derby is now about to get its second erotic mini golf venue.

00:36:45.660 --> 00:36:46.900
 It's really popular.

00:36:46.900 --> 00:36:56.340
 The new glory holes golf venue will apparently include risque items and decor and some Derby

00:36:56.340 --> 00:36:57.540
 themed holes as well.

00:36:57.540 --> 00:36:58.540
 So that's nice.

00:36:58.540 --> 00:36:59.540
 That's cool.

00:36:59.540 --> 00:37:00.540
 That's good.

00:37:00.540 --> 00:37:03.860
 Can I quickly, just because let's give this fact just a tiny bit of substance before we

00:37:03.860 --> 00:37:09.780
 get into erotic golf, I just want to quickly say that the production just for context was

00:37:09.780 --> 00:37:15.180
 the first ever Dracula production and it was put on in the early 1920s and it was a show

00:37:15.180 --> 00:37:21.260
 that was sanctioned and approved by Florence Stoker, who was the widow of Bram Stoker.

00:37:21.260 --> 00:37:25.220
 And this was the production that became the sort of official theater production that as

00:37:25.220 --> 00:37:31.980
 it traveled around the UK and then went international, cast in its lead, Bella Lagosi, who became,

00:37:31.980 --> 00:37:34.540
 as we all know, the iconic Dracula in film.

00:37:34.540 --> 00:37:41.140
 And weirdly, the final performance that Bella Lagosi ever did as Dracula on stage was back

00:37:41.140 --> 00:37:47.020
 in Derby at another theater just around the corner from the ground some 20-odd years later.

00:37:47.020 --> 00:37:52.620
 So Derby does have a real Dracula connection as a result of this, very interesting.

00:37:52.620 --> 00:37:57.180
 And Lagosi, so he got the role in 1927 when the play moved to the USA.

00:37:57.180 --> 00:37:58.700
 That's when Lagosi entered the scene.

00:37:58.700 --> 00:38:03.820
 And then in the fifties, it was when he toured again and came back to Derby and did a big

00:38:03.820 --> 00:38:05.500
 English tour of this show.

00:38:05.500 --> 00:38:08.340
 And he got really upset because apparently the audiences were laughing sometimes because

00:38:08.340 --> 00:38:10.060
 Dracula was no longer the big scary thing.

00:38:10.060 --> 00:38:14.900
 It had been, it was the early fifties, you know, people have been through a bit since

00:38:14.900 --> 00:38:15.900
 the time t's.

00:38:15.900 --> 00:38:21.660
 They, they're not as scared and yeah, it seems to have prompted the end of his career, which

00:38:21.660 --> 00:38:22.660
 is very sad.

00:38:22.660 --> 00:38:26.340
 And it was also this play was also very important for the image of Dracula, the guy who wrote

00:38:26.340 --> 00:38:28.420
 it, a guy called Hamilton Dean.

00:38:28.420 --> 00:38:34.780
 He made Dracula appear as that more modern suave sort of coat wearing cocktail drinking

00:38:34.780 --> 00:38:40.860
 kind of character rather than Brams just all out vampire chaos energy zombie like sir.

00:38:40.860 --> 00:38:43.020
 Does it, he drink cocktails?

00:38:43.020 --> 00:38:44.020
 Does he?

00:38:44.020 --> 00:38:46.140
 Is it passion fruit martini?

00:38:46.140 --> 00:38:47.700
 Sorry, he does.

00:38:47.700 --> 00:38:52.700
 There was actually one earlier theater production of Dracula, which came out eight days before

00:38:52.700 --> 00:38:54.560
 the novel came out.

00:38:54.560 --> 00:38:59.620
 This was if you did a novel, someone else could make a play of it and there's not much

00:38:59.620 --> 00:39:03.660
 you can do about it unless you put on your own play.

00:39:03.660 --> 00:39:10.880
 And so what Bram Stoker did was he had a dramatic reading of his book on stage.

00:39:10.880 --> 00:39:13.820
 They had to have it open for the paying public.

00:39:13.820 --> 00:39:20.580
 So they would put bills up half an hour before it started saying Dracula on in half an hour

00:39:20.580 --> 00:39:26.420
 add two people bought tickets for it and sat in the audience while a couple of actors sort

00:39:26.420 --> 00:39:28.580
 of just read through the book.

00:39:28.580 --> 00:39:32.380
 And from them doing that, it meant that no one else could play on because he owed copyright

00:39:32.380 --> 00:39:33.820
 on the theater production.

00:39:33.820 --> 00:39:34.820
 How amazing.

00:39:34.820 --> 00:39:35.820
 Yeah.

00:39:35.820 --> 00:39:36.820
 Monica, have you done that with really good actually?

00:39:36.820 --> 00:39:40.900
 I should do to stop someone doing a bootleg play.

00:39:40.900 --> 00:39:46.620
 That's basically what my experience of doing the Edinburgh fringe was going out half an

00:39:46.620 --> 00:39:53.620
 hour before the show being like somebody and then you know, mildly entertaining two people.

00:39:53.620 --> 00:39:57.100
 Chills, actual chills remembering that everyone's Edinburgh.

00:39:57.100 --> 00:39:58.100
 Yeah.

00:39:58.100 --> 00:39:59.100
 Okay, Dan.

00:39:59.100 --> 00:40:00.100
 We've done the Dracula thing.

00:40:00.100 --> 00:40:01.100
 Can we go back to the erotic?

00:40:01.100 --> 00:40:02.100
 Mini golf.

00:40:02.100 --> 00:40:03.100
 Let's do it.

00:40:03.100 --> 00:40:07.620
 I just remembered when you were talking about that that I have played not played golf, but

00:40:07.620 --> 00:40:14.460
 I've used a golf club shaped like a penis at the penis museum in Reykjavik.

00:40:14.460 --> 00:40:18.980
 They have one and you can sort of pick it up and play with it.

00:40:18.980 --> 00:40:24.100
 And yeah, it's like it's just the head part of the golf club is shaped like a penis.

00:40:24.100 --> 00:40:26.420
 But it's not it's not for a serious golfer, right?

00:40:26.420 --> 00:40:30.260
 As in it's not built for proper play, you know, master's conditions.

00:40:30.260 --> 00:40:35.260
 I don't think it adheres to the official USPGA rules.

00:40:35.260 --> 00:40:36.860
 It's like a walking stick full of bagels.

00:40:36.860 --> 00:40:42.060
 You're not going to use it as an actual assist as a walking stick.

00:40:42.060 --> 00:40:48.220
 I think there's a link between the original boom in crazy golf and the current Derby based

00:40:48.220 --> 00:40:50.140
 boom in erotic golf.

00:40:50.140 --> 00:40:51.140
 Okay.

00:40:51.140 --> 00:40:52.860
 So when was the original boom?

00:40:52.860 --> 00:40:55.180
 Twenties and thirties.

00:40:55.180 --> 00:40:58.820
 Some some lots of sources say that it completely went out when the Great Depression happened.

00:40:58.820 --> 00:41:05.020
 But actually, it didn't really it actually boomed during the early thirties.

00:41:05.020 --> 00:41:09.740
 During that period, apparently the USA built 25,000 mini golf courses.

00:41:09.740 --> 00:41:14.020
 It was described as a devastating craze in the times in 1930.

00:41:14.020 --> 00:41:17.740
 And I think the theory behind it is that property value had collapsed and the value of lots

00:41:17.740 --> 00:41:21.660
 of things have collapsed and people started their own tiny businesses to generate small

00:41:21.660 --> 00:41:23.300
 amounts of income.

00:41:23.300 --> 00:41:27.220
 You know, it doesn't have to be anything huge, but it's it's a small local thing on

00:41:27.220 --> 00:41:30.580
 whatever kind of waste ground or land you've got.

00:41:30.580 --> 00:41:34.420
 You know, some restaurants turned it half the restaurant became a mini golf course and

00:41:34.420 --> 00:41:36.100
 the rest of it stayed a restaurant.

00:41:36.100 --> 00:41:39.320
 So maybe times of financial hardship when you get a lot more mini golf because you get

00:41:39.320 --> 00:41:41.300
 shops that are closed or empty.

00:41:41.300 --> 00:41:45.580
 So the new glory hole golf is the site of the old gap store in Derby.

00:41:45.580 --> 00:41:47.700
 You know, you've got retail space available.

00:41:47.700 --> 00:41:48.700
 What is a glory hole?

00:41:48.700 --> 00:41:49.700
 I've got a gap.

00:41:49.700 --> 00:41:54.020
 So no, that's my economic theory.

00:41:54.020 --> 00:41:56.140
 No, it's a really, yeah, it's a really good theory.

00:41:56.140 --> 00:41:59.620
 It's almost a thesis rather than a podcast, isn't it?

00:41:59.620 --> 00:42:01.460
 Mini golf doesn't use golf balls.

00:42:01.460 --> 00:42:04.460
 Yes, they do.

00:42:04.460 --> 00:42:09.100
 There are there are special mini golf balls.

00:42:09.100 --> 00:42:10.100
 They're kind of more rubbery.

00:42:10.100 --> 00:42:11.100
 They're more rubbery.

00:42:11.100 --> 00:42:12.100
 They bounce more.

00:42:12.100 --> 00:42:14.900
 And there's a stand that I find this mad.

00:42:14.900 --> 00:42:16.380
 There's the world crazy golf championships.

00:42:16.380 --> 00:42:19.100
 I mean, there are a few world crazy golf championships.

00:42:19.100 --> 00:42:23.020
 One is in Hastings and normally apparently they only get about three overseas players

00:42:23.020 --> 00:42:24.020
 each year.

00:42:24.020 --> 00:42:29.900
 So the extent to which this world is a bit debatable, but they don't tell you at the

00:42:29.900 --> 00:42:34.620
 world crazy golf championships what the ball is until the day before it starts.

00:42:34.620 --> 00:42:37.260
 Okay, but it's always going to be spherical.

00:42:37.260 --> 00:42:38.260
 It's always going to be spherical.

00:42:38.260 --> 00:42:39.420
 I'm pretty sure about that.

00:42:39.420 --> 00:42:43.380
 But then other championships, they will they'll let you play a different ball on every hole.

00:42:43.380 --> 00:42:46.260
 And the only rule is that once you've started a hole, you have to play the same ball all

00:42:46.260 --> 00:42:47.260
 the way through the end.

00:42:47.260 --> 00:42:48.260
 Like normal golf.

00:42:48.260 --> 00:42:49.260
 Is that true?

00:42:49.260 --> 00:42:50.260
 How about local?

00:42:50.260 --> 00:42:51.260
 Or mini golf?

00:42:51.260 --> 00:42:53.820
 Like we play in Narrabean in Australia.

00:42:53.820 --> 00:42:55.420
 They're using special balls.

00:42:55.420 --> 00:42:58.700
 I think they'll be more rubbery for sure if you check them.

00:42:58.700 --> 00:42:59.700
 Yeah.

00:42:59.700 --> 00:43:03.020
 Who would have thought this would be the fact that blew my mind most in this whole round

00:43:03.020 --> 00:43:05.220
 of nine years golf again.

00:43:05.220 --> 00:43:07.060
 I'm going.

00:43:07.060 --> 00:43:11.420
 This is I'm afraid it's back to the it's back to a tangent from the original erotic

00:43:11.420 --> 00:43:12.420
 mini golf thing.

00:43:12.420 --> 00:43:13.420
 Oh yeah.

00:43:13.420 --> 00:43:16.460
 Just that it was on, you know, this new place opening up is going to be called glory holes

00:43:16.460 --> 00:43:17.460
 golf.

00:43:17.460 --> 00:43:22.420
 And we got an email in the fish and box recently subject line Gibbon glory hole action.

00:43:22.420 --> 00:43:23.420
 Oh my God.

00:43:23.420 --> 00:43:24.420
 I know this story.

00:43:24.420 --> 00:43:25.420
 This is incredible.

00:43:25.420 --> 00:43:29.820
 This is a Gibbon in a zoo or a sanctuary.

00:43:29.820 --> 00:43:34.660
 This is a female Gibbon and she was living on her own and she got pregnant and it

00:43:34.660 --> 00:43:39.820
 was it was basically a virgin birth and it was it was so exciting for the scientists.

00:43:39.820 --> 00:43:40.820
 They thought I can't believe this.

00:43:40.820 --> 00:43:44.620
 Anyway, they did a bit of an investigation and it turned out obviously it was not a virgin

00:43:44.620 --> 00:43:45.620
 birth.

00:43:45.620 --> 00:43:51.700
 In between her enclosure and the next door neighbor male Gibbons enclosure was a nine

00:43:51.700 --> 00:43:59.180
 millimeter hole through which they had managed to successfully breed and become parents.

00:43:59.180 --> 00:44:00.180
 Nine.

00:44:00.180 --> 00:44:04.580
 They were just sort of both mushing up against the wall.

00:44:04.580 --> 00:44:06.140
 I'm afraid so.

00:44:06.140 --> 00:44:07.140
 Life finds a way.

00:44:07.140 --> 00:44:08.140
 Yes.

00:44:08.140 --> 00:44:09.140
 Wow.

00:44:09.140 --> 00:44:11.700
 That's a scene I don't want to see in Jurassic Park.

00:44:11.700 --> 00:44:15.220
 I would like to hear David Attenborough do one of his little jokes.

00:44:15.220 --> 00:44:19.740
 You know when he sort of makes the animals a fool or he's like our nest is as good a

00:44:19.740 --> 00:44:21.700
 place as any.

00:44:21.700 --> 00:44:31.660
 Okay, it's time for our final fact of the show and that is James.

00:44:31.660 --> 00:44:36.740
 Okay, my fact this week is that in twenty nine and eight to the Canadian Prime Minister

00:44:36.740 --> 00:44:42.380
 called ten Downing Street to offer condolences for the death of Margaret Thatcher.

00:44:42.380 --> 00:44:44.060
 In fact, she wasn't dead.

00:44:44.060 --> 00:44:48.580
 It was a misunderstanding due to the death of the Canadian Transport Minister's cat

00:44:48.580 --> 00:44:50.260
 who was also called Thatcher.

00:44:50.260 --> 00:44:51.260
 Superb.

00:44:51.260 --> 00:44:52.260
 Yeah.

00:44:52.260 --> 00:44:53.260
 Really good.

00:44:53.260 --> 00:44:54.260
 What a cool.

00:44:54.260 --> 00:44:55.260
 What a cool.

00:44:55.260 --> 00:44:56.260
 Flying the wall at that cool.

00:44:56.260 --> 00:44:57.260
 Yeah.

00:44:57.260 --> 00:44:58.260
 A muggy, not a Maggie.

00:44:58.260 --> 00:44:59.260
 Oh, brilliant.

00:44:59.260 --> 00:45:00.260
 Brilliant.

00:45:00.260 --> 00:45:01.260
 Was that you Dan?

00:45:01.260 --> 00:45:02.260
 Someone else?

00:45:02.260 --> 00:45:03.260
 No, no, no.

00:45:03.260 --> 00:45:04.260
 That's the headline of the Guardian article.

00:45:04.260 --> 00:45:05.260
 That's wrong.

00:45:05.260 --> 00:45:06.260
 Amazing.

00:45:06.260 --> 00:45:08.780
 It was a black tie dinner in Toronto.

00:45:08.780 --> 00:45:14.100
 Two thousand Canadian Conservatives were there and many of them got a text message saying

00:45:14.100 --> 00:45:21.620
 simply Thatcher has died and Demetri Seedas, who was the aide to the Prime Minister, who

00:45:21.620 --> 00:45:26.780
 was Stephen Harper at the time, he was sent to ride a letter of condolence and he ran

00:45:26.780 --> 00:45:31.100
 Buckingham Palace in Ten Downing Street to kind of work out what they should say and

00:45:31.100 --> 00:45:36.060
 you know, and offer condolences as well and then he found out that they hadn't died and

00:45:36.060 --> 00:45:42.620
 it turned out that Transport Minister John Baird had a 16 year old grey cat called Thatcher

00:45:42.620 --> 00:45:48.740
 and sadly that cat had died but he denied sending the text later on but there definitely

00:45:48.740 --> 00:45:52.700
 was a text that was sent to all these people about the cat.

00:45:52.700 --> 00:45:57.460
 This is like international incident version of David's dead on Big Brezwick.

00:45:57.460 --> 00:45:58.460
 Yes.

00:45:58.460 --> 00:46:02.900
 That's the greatest TV moment ever.

00:46:02.900 --> 00:46:04.420
 There was a famous David who died.

00:46:04.420 --> 00:46:05.420
 David Bowie.

00:46:05.420 --> 00:46:06.420
 Yeah.

00:46:06.420 --> 00:46:10.460
 Did someone in the building know who, I don't know why I'm telling this story, everyone

00:46:10.460 --> 00:46:11.460
 knows it better than me apparently.

00:46:11.460 --> 00:46:12.460
 Monica, you can tell it.

00:46:12.460 --> 00:46:13.460
 No, no, no.

00:46:13.460 --> 00:46:14.460
 Please, you tell it.

00:46:14.460 --> 00:46:15.460
 I've actually only seen the clip.

00:46:15.460 --> 00:46:19.620
 Okay, so in the Big Brother household that year was Angie Bowie, the first wife of David

00:46:19.620 --> 00:46:25.660
 Bowie and also in the house that year was David Guest, who was Liza Minnelli's ex-husband.

00:46:25.660 --> 00:46:26.660
 Right.

00:46:26.660 --> 00:46:30.380
 Angie gets called in while David Guest is having a sleep in his bed.

00:46:30.380 --> 00:46:34.820
 Everyone knows he's having a sleep so he's not around and she gets told that David Bowie

00:46:34.820 --> 00:46:41.260
 has died, so she is obviously, she didn't like her ex-husband, but she's also very distressed

00:46:41.260 --> 00:46:42.580
 because he was a huge part of her life.

00:46:42.580 --> 00:46:46.380
 She comes out, she's trying to keep it secret, and one of the other Americans who's staying

00:46:46.380 --> 00:46:49.260
 in the house comes up and says, "Are you okay?"

00:46:49.260 --> 00:46:52.880
 And she says, "You can't tell anyone, but David's dead."

00:46:52.880 --> 00:46:56.900
 And this other woman immediately freaks out because she thinks it's David Guest who's

00:46:56.900 --> 00:46:59.540
 died, but Angie hasn't made the connection.

00:46:59.540 --> 00:47:02.060
 So Angie's kind of going, "God, I didn't think you were that big a Bowie fan.

00:47:02.060 --> 00:47:07.260
 I can't see how this has erupted, and it causes chaos in the house for five minutes.

00:47:07.260 --> 00:47:08.780
 It's TV at its finest."

00:47:08.780 --> 00:47:11.940
 Well, imagine that, but with 2,000 Canadian conservatives.

00:47:11.940 --> 00:47:12.940
 Yeah.

00:47:12.940 --> 00:47:14.900
 What a scene it must have been.

00:47:14.900 --> 00:47:16.620
 The true patriot love tribute dinner.

00:47:16.620 --> 00:47:17.620
 Oh, is that what it was?

00:47:17.620 --> 00:47:18.620
 That's what it was called.

00:47:18.620 --> 00:47:22.860
 Military family's honoring thing, but Canadian politics moniker is fabulous.

00:47:22.860 --> 00:47:24.860
 Who's doing it?

00:47:24.860 --> 00:47:29.300
 Well, I feel like there is, I feel like there is a list of political scandals in Canada

00:47:29.300 --> 00:47:36.860
 on Wikipedia and some of them are pretty dry, like the usual grift or bribery or slightly

00:47:36.860 --> 00:47:37.860
 dodgy dealings.

00:47:37.860 --> 00:47:39.900
 But there are some fun ones.

00:47:39.900 --> 00:47:42.540
 Tunergate might be my favorite.

00:47:42.540 --> 00:47:43.540
 Tunergate.

00:47:43.540 --> 00:47:45.860
 Were you involved in Tunergate, Monica?

00:47:45.860 --> 00:47:48.620
 Not to my knowledge, but I'll never admit it if so.

00:47:48.620 --> 00:47:50.220
 You'll never catch me.

00:47:50.220 --> 00:47:51.220
 Sorry.

00:47:51.220 --> 00:47:54.380
 Tunergate, actually think about it now, Tunergate is way too long ago.

00:47:54.380 --> 00:47:55.380
 You're clear.

00:47:55.380 --> 00:47:56.380
 You're clear.

00:47:56.380 --> 00:47:57.380
 You're clear.

00:47:57.380 --> 00:47:59.540
 I'm a Canadian cans of decomposing tuna.

00:47:59.540 --> 00:48:01.820
 Oh, that was the central problem, right?

00:48:01.820 --> 00:48:05.740
 And it wasn't really, really, really unsafe, but it had started to go off before it was

00:48:05.740 --> 00:48:06.740
 put in the cans.

00:48:06.740 --> 00:48:10.620
 The firm involved was called Starkis and they said, "No, you just, these inspectors, they

00:48:10.620 --> 00:48:12.020
 just don't like fish.

00:48:12.020 --> 00:48:13.020
 That's their problem."

00:48:13.020 --> 00:48:15.900
 And they said, "And we'll close down our plant and you'll lose all these jobs."

00:48:15.900 --> 00:48:18.100
 And you know, and that's when it becomes a political thing.

00:48:18.100 --> 00:48:22.060
 Because then the fisheries minister said, "Oh, yeah, it's probably, it's fine.

00:48:22.060 --> 00:48:23.900
 Yeah, all this stuff, it's great.

00:48:23.900 --> 00:48:25.500
 It's actually good."

00:48:25.500 --> 00:48:29.180
 And he got a panel together, just like, "Look, can you just assess this tuna, please?"

00:48:29.180 --> 00:48:31.660
 And they said, "Yeah, this is rotting tuna in these cans."

00:48:31.660 --> 00:48:34.220
 And he says, "Okay, I think we need a different panel."

00:48:34.220 --> 00:48:37.500
 And he got a different panel together who eventually said, "Yes, these million tons

00:48:37.500 --> 00:48:39.460
 of rotting tuna are fine."

00:48:39.460 --> 00:48:40.460
 And then he resigned.

00:48:40.460 --> 00:48:41.460
 Yeah.

00:48:41.460 --> 00:48:42.940
 And I don't think much of the tuna was eaten in the end.

00:48:42.940 --> 00:48:44.460
 And then the firm went bust anyway.

00:48:44.460 --> 00:48:49.060
 So that's a very classic Canadian scandal where it's like, it threatened to really kick off

00:48:49.060 --> 00:48:55.780
 and ultimately they just, nobody really consumed the tuna and it was sort of fine.

00:48:55.780 --> 00:48:59.580
 That's like the other great Canadian political scandal, the Fuddleduddle incident.

00:48:59.580 --> 00:49:00.580
 What's this?

00:49:00.580 --> 00:49:06.380
 The Fuddleduddle incident in 1971 happened to the first Prime Minister Trudeau, our current

00:49:06.380 --> 00:49:11.940
 Prime Minister's father, who was accused of having spoken or at least mouthed unparliamentary

00:49:11.940 --> 00:49:13.980
 language in the House of Commons.

00:49:13.980 --> 00:49:18.620
 He seemed to have been caught mouthing the words "fuck off."

00:49:18.620 --> 00:49:23.620
 But when pressed by television reporters would only admit having moved his lips, they were

00:49:23.620 --> 00:49:25.820
 like, "What were you thinking when you moved your lips?"

00:49:25.820 --> 00:49:31.140
 And his response was, "What is the nature of your thoughts when you say Fuddleduddle

00:49:31.140 --> 00:49:33.380
 or something like that?"

00:49:33.380 --> 00:49:36.100
 Implying that he had said Fuddleduddle instead of "fuck off."

00:49:36.100 --> 00:49:37.100
 Right.

00:49:37.100 --> 00:49:38.100
 That's good.

00:49:38.100 --> 00:49:41.060
 If no one's heard you, you know, you're across the room from them.

00:49:41.060 --> 00:49:46.340
 Well, then in 2015, his son actually stated on the record that his dad had not said Fuddleduddle.

00:49:46.340 --> 00:49:47.980
 And this is a big scandal.

00:49:47.980 --> 00:49:48.980
 Minor scandal.

00:49:48.980 --> 00:49:49.980
 But that's sort of the scale.

00:49:49.980 --> 00:49:55.060
 It's like someone, that's always the scale, it's always a little bit funny, like someone

00:49:55.060 --> 00:49:59.420
 threw a pie in Jean Chrétien's face in the '90s and that was quite a big deal.

00:49:59.420 --> 00:50:05.860
 The pies were actually coordinated ongoing assault with Fuddleduddle, entartiste, sewer

00:50:05.860 --> 00:50:08.340
 Canadian satirical political group.

00:50:08.340 --> 00:50:14.100
 And they even released a hit list of people they wanted to get with pies, including Celine

00:50:14.100 --> 00:50:16.540
 Dion and Conrad Black and Chrétien.

00:50:16.540 --> 00:50:20.180
 And then they were successful in pieing Chrétien twice.

00:50:20.180 --> 00:50:21.180
 Right.

00:50:21.180 --> 00:50:22.260
 Oh, that's got to stink.

00:50:22.260 --> 00:50:27.300
 The pies, were they the kind of clown pies where it's just custard or is it actual like

00:50:27.300 --> 00:50:28.300
 apple pies?

00:50:28.300 --> 00:50:29.300
 Cream pies.

00:50:29.300 --> 00:50:31.220
 Like, oh, it's just cream pies.

00:50:31.220 --> 00:50:35.640
 It may even have been shaving cream or just like what you guys would unfortunately call

00:50:35.640 --> 00:50:36.640
 squirty cream.

00:50:36.640 --> 00:50:37.640
 Squirty cream.

00:50:37.640 --> 00:50:41.340
 It's not a nice thing to say and I'm sorry to say it.

00:50:41.340 --> 00:50:46.860
 Speaking of shaving cream, I can't believe we managed to get onto shaving cream.

00:50:46.860 --> 00:50:51.940
 William Lyon Mackenzie King, who was Prime Minister of Canada for 22 years.

00:50:51.940 --> 00:50:52.940
 My favourite.

00:50:52.940 --> 00:50:56.580
 Well, I'm not surprised because he did seances and stuff right then.

00:50:56.580 --> 00:51:01.220
 But he also used to see symbols in his shaving cream in the morning, which he thought would

00:51:01.220 --> 00:51:02.220
 predict the future.

00:51:02.220 --> 00:51:03.220
 Yeah.

00:51:03.220 --> 00:51:04.220
 Wow.

00:51:04.220 --> 00:51:08.200
 I mean, he was he was Prime Minister for 21 years, which possibly is still the record

00:51:08.200 --> 00:51:09.800
 length or anyone to do it.

00:51:09.800 --> 00:51:11.280
 He had quite a tragic family life.

00:51:11.280 --> 00:51:14.240
 He lost all of his family during the war.

00:51:14.240 --> 00:51:19.280
 And so as a result, turned like many people did to spirituality as a thing.

00:51:19.280 --> 00:51:23.720
 But what many people didn't realise at the time was he was taking that spirituality into

00:51:23.720 --> 00:51:31.000
 the into the office with him as a Prime Minister and getting guidance from the spirits of Leonardo

00:51:31.000 --> 00:51:34.040
 Da Vinci and his deceased dogs.

00:51:34.040 --> 00:51:38.060
 The shaving film thing, he was shaved and then the shaving film would go into the water

00:51:38.060 --> 00:51:40.860
 on the in the sink kind of thing.

00:51:40.860 --> 00:51:46.300
 And at one stage, he saw a polar bear and an eagle and the polar bear was supposed to

00:51:46.300 --> 00:51:50.900
 represent like Russia or Soviet Union, I should say, and the eagle supposed to represent

00:51:50.900 --> 00:51:51.900
 America.

00:51:51.900 --> 00:51:55.220
 And they were kind of fighting in shaving cream.

00:51:55.220 --> 00:52:00.300
 And then a dog appeared in the shaving cream, which he thought symbolised Canada, and then

00:52:00.300 --> 00:52:03.860
 it came and helped to push the bear off the eagle.

00:52:03.860 --> 00:52:08.040
 And that was kind of him thinking that he what side he needs to be in the Cold War needs

00:52:08.040 --> 00:52:09.040
 to be on the other side.

00:52:09.040 --> 00:52:12.300
 As if he didn't know what side he should probably be on in the Cold War.

00:52:12.300 --> 00:52:16.460
 I think that probably just confirmed his suspicions.

00:52:16.460 --> 00:52:20.880
 I do feel like a polar bear would be fairly easy to see in shaving cream.

00:52:20.880 --> 00:52:25.160
 Like I'm wondering if the shapes he was seeing were sort of like, you know, I saw a vision

00:52:25.160 --> 00:52:29.440
 in my shaving cream of a cloud meeting sort of a fog.

00:52:29.440 --> 00:52:30.440
 Yeah.

00:52:30.440 --> 00:52:31.440
 Oh my God.

00:52:31.440 --> 00:52:32.440
 What a character.

00:52:32.440 --> 00:52:33.440
 Yeah, amazing guy.

00:52:33.440 --> 00:52:38.140
 So just having a look through the old, the old fish inbox, podcast at qi.com.

00:52:38.140 --> 00:52:40.640
 Really good fact we got in from, from John Ford.

00:52:40.640 --> 00:52:41.640
 So thank you, John.

00:52:41.640 --> 00:52:43.980
 This is something maybe you've done at Monica.

00:52:43.980 --> 00:52:50.260
 It's that Canada flies a new flag over its parliament every single day, every single

00:52:50.260 --> 00:52:57.100
 day there's a new flag, and they give the used one to a Canadian and you can apply to

00:52:57.100 --> 00:52:58.100
 get your own flag.

00:52:58.100 --> 00:53:01.180
 And you think I have done this?

00:53:01.180 --> 00:53:04.720
 Well, guess it's possible.

00:53:04.720 --> 00:53:10.000
 Feel like you haven't anymore.

00:53:10.000 --> 00:53:14.080
 I haven't quite, no, but if I said that I have the option, well, you have the option,

00:53:14.080 --> 00:53:16.960
 but unfortunately you won't get the flag.

00:53:16.960 --> 00:53:18.400
 So this is a bad thing.

00:53:18.400 --> 00:53:21.960
 The current waiting time is 100 years.

00:53:21.960 --> 00:53:24.960
 It's more than a century because so many people have applied.

00:53:24.960 --> 00:53:27.360
 So they mentioned this on the website, like it's a totally normal thing.

00:53:27.360 --> 00:53:30.120
 Yeah, they say the current waiting time is more than 100 years.

00:53:30.120 --> 00:53:34.900
 And so you can either log on and make a request, why would you, or you can change your details

00:53:34.900 --> 00:53:38.780
 if you made a request, you know, five years ago and you're moving house now.

00:53:38.780 --> 00:53:39.940
 Just to keep it updated.

00:53:39.940 --> 00:53:41.340
 But why would you do that either?

00:53:41.340 --> 00:53:44.340
 Are you allowed to do it for your next generation?

00:53:44.340 --> 00:53:45.340
 Exactly.

00:53:45.340 --> 00:53:46.340
 Can I go to the descendants?

00:53:46.340 --> 00:53:50.900
 I don't think I'll know any of my hundred year from now descendants well enough to care

00:53:50.900 --> 00:53:53.180
 whether or not they get a flag.

00:53:53.180 --> 00:53:55.780
 It's also like not hard to get.

00:53:55.780 --> 00:53:56.780
 It's not very special.

00:53:56.780 --> 00:53:59.480
 It's only been up over a parliament for one day.

00:53:59.480 --> 00:54:00.480
 Yep.

00:54:00.480 --> 00:54:02.680
 You could just get your own flag.

00:54:02.680 --> 00:54:05.680
 It's the kind of shit I buy in eBay.

00:54:05.680 --> 00:54:08.440
 This is all part of my divorce.

00:54:08.440 --> 00:54:11.340
 That's giving unreasonable behavior to me actually.

00:54:11.340 --> 00:54:19.280
 Have you been reading about William Amos from the Liberal Party in the last few months?

00:54:19.280 --> 00:54:28.060
 Very recently he was on a parliamentary Zoom call and he had to apologize because he said

00:54:28.060 --> 00:54:35.660
 I urinated without realizing I was on camera and the amazing thing was is that the month

00:54:35.660 --> 00:54:41.260
 earlier he'd also been recorded in the nude during the virtual session of the Canadian

00:54:41.260 --> 00:54:42.340
 Parliament.

00:54:42.340 --> 00:54:44.460
 So twice in two months.

00:54:44.460 --> 00:54:50.520
 The first time he'd been out for a jog and he was kind of getting changed while the

00:54:50.520 --> 00:54:53.720
 session was going on and they could see.

00:54:53.720 --> 00:54:54.720
 See it all.

00:54:54.720 --> 00:54:55.720
 Yeah.

00:54:55.720 --> 00:54:56.720
 See the right honorable member.

00:54:56.720 --> 00:54:59.160
 See his loony and his toony.

00:54:59.160 --> 00:55:01.880
 But yeah.

00:55:01.880 --> 00:55:06.880
 I can see myself not falling for that just I can see myself doing that.

00:55:06.880 --> 00:55:07.880
 Twice in a row?

00:55:07.880 --> 00:55:10.360
 You quickly check maybe not twice in a row.

00:55:10.360 --> 00:55:12.720
 I think what's better than this case right?

00:55:12.720 --> 00:55:16.340
 Yeah I would definitely get a post-it for the camera after the first time.

00:55:16.340 --> 00:55:17.340
 Yeah.

00:55:17.340 --> 00:55:18.340
 Would I?

00:55:18.340 --> 00:55:19.340
 I don't know.

00:55:19.340 --> 00:55:20.840
 No you would think I couldn't possibly do that again.

00:55:20.840 --> 00:55:21.840
 That's what you think.

00:55:21.840 --> 00:55:22.840
 That's what you think.

00:55:22.840 --> 00:55:24.740
 Oh my god that was the stupidest day of my life.

00:55:24.740 --> 00:55:28.180
 No more mistakes on that front and then you just go along and you know do you say he was

00:55:28.180 --> 00:55:30.100
 urinating into a cup or something?

00:55:30.100 --> 00:55:31.100
 I don't.

00:55:31.100 --> 00:55:32.100
 I don't know.

00:55:32.100 --> 00:55:35.700
 As far as I can tell because this kind of thing has now happened you know we're pretty

00:55:35.700 --> 00:55:36.700
 deep in the pandemic.

00:55:36.700 --> 00:55:38.100
 It's not happened a number of times.

00:55:38.100 --> 00:55:43.380
 It's been fairly high profile people and it has as far as I'm aware never happened to

00:55:43.380 --> 00:55:44.380
 a woman.

00:55:44.380 --> 00:55:51.280
 It's just men who I don't know haven't thought it through or aren't worried enough.

00:55:51.280 --> 00:55:54.260
 I can't even believe that you're saying that you think this could happen to you.

00:55:54.260 --> 00:55:56.920
 This would never happen to me.

00:55:56.920 --> 00:56:02.440
 There's no world in which I would be like okay I'm doing a work Zoom.

00:56:02.440 --> 00:56:05.000
 I'm going to quickly get fully nude.

00:56:05.000 --> 00:56:13.460
 No one has to know.

00:56:13.460 --> 00:56:14.460
 Okay that's it.

00:56:14.460 --> 00:56:15.460

 It is an absolute rockin' book.

00:57:13.140 --> 00:57:14.460
