00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,580
 (upbeat music)

2
00:00:02,580 --> 00:00:05,640
 (speaking in foreign language)

3
00:00:05,640 --> 00:00:08,040
 (upbeat music)

4
00:00:08,040 --> 00:00:10,940
 (upbeat music)

5
00:00:10,940 --> 00:00:13,880
 - Hello and welcome to another episode

6
00:00:13,880 --> 00:00:16,020
 of No Such Thing as a Fish.

7
00:00:16,020 --> 00:00:19,020
 (audience cheering)

8
00:00:19,020 --> 00:00:22,660
 (speaking in foreign language)

9
00:00:22,660 --> 00:00:24,660
 from Oxford.

10
00:00:24,660 --> 00:00:28,160
 (audience cheering)

11
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:29,400
 My name is Dan Schreiber.

12
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:31,480
 Here I am sitting here with Anna Chazinski,

13
00:00:31,480 --> 00:00:33,360
 Andrew Hunter Murray, and James Harkin.

14
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:35,600
 And once again, we have gathered around the microphones

15
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:38,080
 with our four favorite facts from the last seven days

16
00:00:38,080 --> 00:00:40,240
 and in no particular order, here we go.

17
00:00:40,240 --> 00:00:42,080
 Starting with you, Anna.

18
00:00:42,080 --> 00:00:44,920
 - My fact this week is that the Victorian soldier,

19
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:48,600
 Major Charles Bendire, once braved enemy fire

20
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:50,280
 to get an egg from a tree,

21
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:52,680
 then held it in his mouth while he climbed down.

22
00:00:52,680 --> 00:00:55,320
 And on finding that it was stuck inside his mouth,

23
00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:57,320
 removed one of his teeth to free it.

24
00:00:57,320 --> 00:01:00,160
 (audience laughing)

25
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:01,000
 It's amazing.

26
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:04,440
 - This is just egg collecting or egging, in fact,

27
00:01:04,440 --> 00:01:07,520
 was a really popular pursuit in the 19th century.

28
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:09,600
 And still some people do it today.

29
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:10,800
 And yeah, he was an egger.

30
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:13,520
 And it was thought of as quite a manly pursuit.

31
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:17,120
 It was very dangerous because like birds lay their eggs

32
00:01:17,120 --> 00:01:19,240
 in precarious positions on cliff faces

33
00:01:19,240 --> 00:01:20,960
 or really high up trees and stuff.

34
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:23,840
 So yeah, Major Charles Bendire got up there

35
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:26,640
 to prove his manhood and yeah, had to have his tooth removed.

36
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:28,880
 And he was being attacked by a patchies, wasn't he?

37
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:29,720
 - Yes.

38
00:01:29,720 --> 00:01:30,880
 - This was an America.

39
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:34,080
 He was trying to get an egg of a zone-tailed hawk.

40
00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:36,720
 And I looked to see how big those eggs are.

41
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:39,960
 And they are about three inches by two inches.

42
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:41,200
 Okay, so if you can imagine that.

43
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:43,120
 What, I've got my phone here.

44
00:01:43,120 --> 00:01:46,640
 The width of my phone, this is an iPhone 6s plus.

45
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:52,760
 This is about the same width as the egg.

46
00:01:52,760 --> 00:01:53,960
 So I'm gonna put it in my mouth.

47
00:01:53,960 --> 00:01:54,800
 Okay.

48
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:57,240
 - Wow.

49
00:01:57,240 --> 00:01:58,240
 - Wow.

50
00:01:58,240 --> 00:01:59,080
 - Listen to this at home.

51
00:01:59,080 --> 00:02:00,080
 This is incredible stuff.

52
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:03,760
 This is, I mean, the people of Oxford

53
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:05,800
 have never seen anyone deep-throw tonight before.

54
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:09,000
 (audience laughing)

55
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,080
 - Nobody has.

56
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:14,080
 - Please no one text me right now.

57
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:16,320
 (audience laughing)

58
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:18,640
 But anyway, that gives you an idea of how big the egg was.

59
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:21,240
 - That's the width of it.

60
00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:23,640
 - Yes, so that's the length actually

61
00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:24,720
 and the width is two inches.

62
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:26,440
 So it's a bit smaller, widthwise.

63
00:02:26,440 --> 00:02:27,600
 It's egg-shaped.

64
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:28,440
 - Wait, is it okay?

65
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:31,240
 (audience laughing)

66
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:34,880
 - You therefore put it in kind of with the long end.

67
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:35,720
 - Yeah.

68
00:02:35,720 --> 00:02:36,720
 - You put it in the wrong way round.

69
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:39,080
 - I know, but I'm terrible, Ega.

70
00:02:39,080 --> 00:02:40,600
 But my feeling is that Charles Bendier

71
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:41,880
 might have done it that way, right?

72
00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:44,000
 Because surely that's how it must have gotten stuck.

73
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:44,840
 - Maybe.

74
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:47,600
 - Well, I think also his jaw swallled up, swelled up.

75
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:50,160
 Due to being under fire, it was a very tense situation.

76
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:51,880
 And I think that made his jaw swell up a bit.

77
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:52,720
 Meaning that--

78
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:53,560
 - Is that what happens?

79
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:55,720
 - That's one account I read, and he had to get,

80
00:02:55,720 --> 00:02:58,760
 so his men took it out under threat of court martial.

81
00:02:58,760 --> 00:03:00,520
 He said, "I will court martial you if you don't..."

82
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:01,360
 - How he went?

83
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:04,640
 (audience laughing)

84
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:05,480
 - Yeah.

85
00:03:05,480 --> 00:03:06,640
 - And his tooth broke, didn't he?

86
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:08,920
 So it may not have been an entire tooth

87
00:03:08,920 --> 00:03:11,240
 and his tooth broke as it was on the way out

88
00:03:11,240 --> 00:03:12,880
 or he insisted that it was broken

89
00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:14,560
 to ensure that he retained the egg.

90
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:16,960
 - So, but burgers, no, sorry, Ega's,

91
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:19,400
 who had dangerous times.

92
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:21,680
 There was another guy called Francis J. Britwell.

93
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:23,360
 I'm pretty sure this is 19th century.

94
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:26,160
 He was strangled by his own climbing rope,

95
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:28,800
 climbing to reach a nest in a tall pine tree

96
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:30,480
 on his honeymoon.

97
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:31,360
 (laughing)

98
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:33,840
 - Oh, yeah, that's a good honeymoon.

99
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:35,760
 - The other thing is that guy, I Googled him

100
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:37,440
 to see if there was anything else about him.

101
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:39,480
 And that seems to be literally the only thing

102
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:41,240
 we know about him.

103
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:43,000
 - Imagine that, that's all you're known for,

104
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,520
 trying to get an egg on your honeymoon.

105
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:45,520
 (laughing)

106
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:47,560
 - He died doing what he loved,

107
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:49,040
 but not doing who he loved,

108
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:50,680
 which is what honeymoon's all about.

109
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:53,440
 (laughing)

110
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:54,800
 - Miss the entire point.

111
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:57,840
 - Yeah, but they get really obsessive, don't they,

112
00:03:57,840 --> 00:03:58,680
 these collectors?

113
00:03:58,680 --> 00:03:59,680
 - Yeah, and they still happen.

114
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:01,680
 So, there's a society called the Jordan,

115
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:03,400
 Jordan, or Jordan Society,

116
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:05,960
 which is named after an egg collector of the 19th century.

117
00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:08,160
 And this sort of still exists,

118
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:09,480
 although they're honorary members now,

119
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:12,400
 because it's actually illegal to take eggs out of bird's nest

120
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:16,640
 because it kind of damages birds' procreation cycles.

121
00:04:16,640 --> 00:04:18,040
 But yeah, there are loads of them around.

122
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:23,000
 So, there's actually one of the UK's most prolific egg collectors

123
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:26,360
 called Colin Watson, who I think had more eggs than anyone else

124
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:28,920
 in the late '90s, and then they all got seized by the police.

125
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:32,680
 But he died falling out of a tree in 2006.

126
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:33,520
 - Oh, yeah.

127
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:34,920
 - So again, still very risky.

128
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:37,520
 - And he's supposedly been retired for years, right?

129
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:38,360
 - Yeah.

130
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:39,440
 - Because he kept getting arrested,

131
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:41,160
 so he said, "I'm no longer in the game."

132
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:46,160
 And then, but he was on a watch list of 300 egg collectors.

133
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:50,240
 So, there's a list where they come,

134
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:52,320
 and they think you have it.

135
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:53,320
 They raid your house.

136
00:04:53,320 --> 00:04:56,840
 - Oh, no, there was one guy who had 3,600 eggs in his house.

137
00:04:56,840 --> 00:05:00,520
 And when the RSPB smashed his door in with the police,

138
00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:02,600
 he said to them, "Thank God you've come.

139
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:03,800
 I can't stop."

140
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:06,080
 So, this is a real obsession that people have.

141
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:06,920
 - Yeah, that's right.

142
00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:09,560
 And often it's the wives or the family who call the police,

143
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:11,120
 don't they, or call the RSPB?

144
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:12,800
 Because they're worried about their husbands,

145
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:14,640
 and they always is husbands.

146
00:05:14,640 --> 00:05:21,520
 Literally every single person on this list is a male age between 25 and 45.

147
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:24,880
 No woman has ever been convicted of eggs, eh?

148
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:25,960
 - Oh, I guess.

149
00:05:25,960 --> 00:05:27,400
 - They're just better at it.

150
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:28,400
 - Thank you.

151
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:31,920
 - I do it all the time.

152
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:33,680
 No one's ever caught me.

153
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:36,440
 - There was a guy called Mervin Shorthouse in the '70s,

154
00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:38,800
 and so there's an egg collection at Trink,

155
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:41,720
 which Walter Rothschild collected, thousands,

156
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:43,800
 maybe I think hundreds of thousands of eggs.

157
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:48,160
 But he broke in, and he posed as a wheelchair-bound invalid,

158
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:53,720
 and he stole, over the course of three years, 10,000 eggs, 10,000.

159
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:56,600
 I think that's about 10 a day for three years, every day,

160
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:59,320
 including Christmas and your birthday.

161
00:05:59,320 --> 00:06:02,080
 And then he mixed up all the labels to apparently cover the theft.

162
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:03,360
 I'm not sure how that covers the theft,

163
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:05,640
 because you've been probably 10,000 eggs in your house.

164
00:06:05,640 --> 00:06:07,840
 - I've heard that with any museum thefts,

165
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:12,080
 and any general theft where there's a label involved,

166
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:15,280
 the biggest problem that any scientist cares about

167
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:16,840
 is they don't care if a thing is stolen,

168
00:06:16,840 --> 00:06:19,280
 because most likely it will be recovered down the line.

169
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:21,240
 A black market trade will reveal it somewhere

170
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:22,520
 somewhere in a house.

171
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:24,960
 It's when you remove the data that says what it was,

172
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:26,600
 where it was, and how it was found.

173
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:28,680
 That's the most important thing that goes missing,

174
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:29,680
 the little label.

175
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:30,520
 - Yeah, yeah.

176
00:06:30,520 --> 00:06:32,080
 - So we're saying steal what you like, but keep labels.

177
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:32,920
 - Leave the labels.

178
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:33,920
 - Yeah.

179
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:36,200
 - steal the labels up, even worse.

180
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:37,200
 - Yeah.

181
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:38,440
 - So strong.

182
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:41,160
 - It must have going into a museum where nothing was labeled.

183
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:42,440
 You were just looking at stuff going,

184
00:06:42,440 --> 00:06:43,640
 "What the fuck is that?"

185
00:06:43,640 --> 00:06:45,080
 (audience laughs)

186
00:06:45,080 --> 00:06:45,920
 No idea.

187
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:46,760
 Is it angel Egyptian?

188
00:06:46,760 --> 00:06:48,120
 Is it 1920s?

189
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:50,200
 There was, it isn't quite gangster.

190
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:51,960
 There's this amazing New Yorker article,

191
00:06:51,960 --> 00:06:53,320
 which I would really recommend,

192
00:06:53,320 --> 00:06:55,360
 which kind of goes through the long history

193
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:57,480
 of egging kind of in the modern day.

194
00:06:57,480 --> 00:07:01,000
 And one of the things it describes is a raid in 1994,

195
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,360
 and this was by the RSPB,

196
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:04,760
 the investigative of the RSPB,

197
00:07:04,760 --> 00:07:07,600
 who was specifically outcatch egg thieves,

198
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:11,680
 and he raided this hotel in Salisbury in 1994.

199
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:12,520
 And there was this,

200
00:07:12,520 --> 00:07:14,440
 'cause he knew that there was a short-down society

201
00:07:14,440 --> 00:07:15,640
 dinner taking place.

202
00:07:15,640 --> 00:07:19,480
 And the RSPB actually planted an attractive female employee

203
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:21,560
 at the bar at the meeting of the egg thieves

204
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:23,200
 to try and get secrets out of them.

205
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:25,040
 Did they think they were gonna get laid?

206
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:28,360
 (audience laughs)

207
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:31,160
 - There's another thing, when you get a prison,

208
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:32,200
 and people have been to prison,

209
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:34,200
 it's illegal to collect bird eggs.

210
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:35,760
 They get a hard time in prison,

211
00:07:35,760 --> 00:07:37,040
 according to one investigator,

212
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:39,160
 'cause it just seems very weird as a crime.

213
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:40,560
 (audience laughs)

214
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:42,400
 And some of them will only speak on the radio

215
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:44,960
 if their voices are disguised,

216
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:46,520
 like they're a terrorist.

217
00:07:46,520 --> 00:07:48,000
 (audience laughs)

218
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,760
 - Oh, yeah, there's one who's called Mr. X,

219
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:51,320
 who's a known egg for eggs.

220
00:07:51,320 --> 00:07:53,320
 (audience laughs)

221
00:07:53,320 --> 00:07:54,920
 Oh, that's what he's done.

222
00:07:54,920 --> 00:07:57,160
 (audience laughs)

223
00:07:57,160 --> 00:07:59,240
 Eggers and you two have the same sense of humour.

224
00:07:59,240 --> 00:08:00,240
 (audience laughs)

225
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:02,480
 But he goes around wearing a crow mask all the time

226
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:03,720
 to disguise his identity.

227
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:06,960
 - He disguises himself by wearing a crow mask.

228
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:09,880
 (audience laughs)

229
00:08:09,880 --> 00:08:11,960
 - He's climbing up trees, though, isn't he?

230
00:08:11,960 --> 00:08:14,360
 (audience laughs)

231
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:16,040
 - I think both other crows and humans

232
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:17,360
 would rumble him immediately.

233
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:20,360
 (audience laughs)

234
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:23,240
 Have you guys heard of the national egg collection?

235
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:24,080
 - No. - This is cool.

236
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:25,440
 This was the first world war thing.

237
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:27,720
 Basically, there were lots of wounded soldiers and sailors,

238
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:30,160
 and the country had to start a massive egg collecting drive

239
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:32,480
 to send to the soldiers and sailors.

240
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:35,760
 They collected a million a week, a million eggs a week,

241
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:37,360
 and they sent them to the front,

242
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:39,040
 which is very dangerous place for an egg.

243
00:08:39,040 --> 00:08:40,880
 (audience laughs)

244
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:43,160
 People wrote their names and addresses on each egg

245
00:08:43,160 --> 00:08:44,640
 with a message for wounded people.

246
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:47,200
 So if you were a soldier lying in hospital near the front,

247
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:48,760
 you would get an egg to live with you with a message

248
00:08:48,760 --> 00:08:50,520
 saying, "Well done, and this is for me,

249
00:08:50,520 --> 00:08:51,640
 "and this is who I am."

250
00:08:51,640 --> 00:08:52,480
 - Oh, yeah.

251
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:53,960
 - I don't think anyone got married off the back of eggs.

252
00:08:53,960 --> 00:08:55,600
 That would be very romantic, I think.

253
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:56,600
 (audience laughs)

254
00:08:56,600 --> 00:08:57,920
 - A similar thing of writing on eggs.

255
00:08:57,920 --> 00:08:59,920
 Have you guys heard of clown eggs?

256
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:02,640
 - If you're a clown, you have a unique pattern

257
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:04,880
 of painting on your face,

258
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:07,560
 and in order to trademark your face,

259
00:09:07,560 --> 00:09:09,360
 you need to paint it on an egg.

260
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:11,800
 And you give that egg to this warehouse in East London.

261
00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:12,760
 There's a few more now,

262
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:14,200
 but initially it was in East London,

263
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:16,800
 and that would trademark your face officially as a thing.

264
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:18,720
 And there's thousands and thousands of eggs.

265
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:19,760
 It's an amazing tradition.

266
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:22,520
 - What if you're a bald clown with no makeup?

267
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:23,600
 - And no features.

268
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:25,120
 (audience laughs)

269
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:27,160
 Like that guy on Twitter.

270
00:09:27,160 --> 00:09:29,080
 (audience laughs)

271
00:09:29,080 --> 00:09:30,600
 He is a dickhead, isn't he?

272
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:31,440
 (audience laughs)

273
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:32,600
 He's so rude.

274
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:34,080
 (audience laughs)

275
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:37,240
 - Can I do some stuff about sticking things in your mouth?

276
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:39,080
 (audience laughs)

277
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:40,240
 - Yeah.

278
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:41,240
 - Is it post curfew?

279
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:42,520
 - Yeah, is it going.

280
00:09:42,520 --> 00:09:45,440
 - So there's a guy called Dinesh Upadhyaya,

281
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:47,280
 who's a science teacher from India,

282
00:09:47,280 --> 00:09:50,640
 and he holds 48 world records for stuffing objects

283
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:52,160
 into his mouth.

284
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:53,000
 - Impressive.

285
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:56,040
 - So he's put five golf balls in there.

286
00:09:56,040 --> 00:09:59,920
 He's 79 grapes, 92 pencils.

287
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:01,400
 - Penisles.

288
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:02,720
 - 92 pencils.

289
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:03,720
 (audience laughs)

290
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:05,480
 - He must have been heavily sharpened.

291
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:07,120
 - Surely.

292
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:09,760
 - You can't go one pencil in your mouth.

293
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:11,720
 - Yeah, you don't tell James what he can't come to do,

294
00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:12,560
 I don't know.

295
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:13,400
 - You put a pencil in there.

296
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:15,040
 - Oh, not all the way in, just.

297
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:16,320
 - Yeah, so they're kind of,

298
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:17,800
 if you can imagine at home,

299
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:19,080
 putting a pencil in your mouth,

300
00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:21,800
 but not sideways like the blood tensor.

301
00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:23,080
 - Like a smokin' a cigar.

302
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:24,320
 - Yes, exactly like that.

303
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:26,000
 So he does that 92 times.

304
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,000
 (audience laughs)

305
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:30,080
 He's done 12 lit candles in his mouth,

306
00:10:30,080 --> 00:10:31,800
 and he says that daily practice

307
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:34,080
 was the key to his success.

308
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:38,440
 And he says he aims to break all possible mouth-stuffing records

309
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:39,720
 as soon as possible.

310
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:41,800
 (audience laughs)

311
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:42,840
 He says, "Great, doesn't he?"

312
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:44,480
 - That's so great.

313
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:46,520
 - I don't reckon he's gone much competition.

314
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:47,360
 I think that's neat.

315
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:49,400
 He could've just put two candles in his mouth.

316
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:50,400
 No one else is doing it.

317
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:52,480
 (audience laughs)

318
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:55,160
 Also, if you're competing over putting lit candles

319
00:10:55,160 --> 00:10:56,000
 in your mouth,

320
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
 you absolutely need to specify on that record

321
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,120
 which way you've inserted it into your mouth.

322
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:02,240
 'Cause if it's just lit and facing outwards,

323
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:03,840
 that's not remotely impressive.

324
00:11:03,840 --> 00:11:04,680
 - Yeah, you're right.

325
00:11:04,680 --> 00:11:06,560
 - That's just you put a bit of wax in your mouth.

326
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:09,000
 - Oh no, because it's, you know,

327
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,440
 the longer you take to put more in,

328
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:13,160
 the closer the flame gets to your head.

329
00:11:13,160 --> 00:11:14,800
 - What do you mean it burns down?

330
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:16,240
 - Yeah, it would burn towards your head.

331
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:18,000
 - You'd have to be pretty slow putting them in.

332
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,000
 - You wouldn't, yeah.

333
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:19,840
 - I don't.

334
00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:23,680
 - It would be like a very, very slow James Bond villain-esque.

335
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:24,920
 (audience laughs)

336
00:11:24,920 --> 00:11:26,760
 - Have you put them Mr. Bond?

337
00:11:26,760 --> 00:11:29,240
 (audience laughs)

338
00:11:29,240 --> 00:11:31,680
 - What budget Bond films have you wanted?

339
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:35,280
 (audience laughs)

340
00:11:35,280 --> 00:11:36,120
 - The dumbest of Bond.

341
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:38,000
 I expect you to age one year.

342
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:41,000
 (audience laughs)

343
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:45,580
 (upbeat music)

344
00:11:45,580 --> 00:11:52,920
 - Okay, it is time for fact number two, and that is James.

345
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:56,000
 - Okay, my fact this week is that if a woman left her husband

346
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,960
 in 18th century England,

347
00:11:57,960 --> 00:12:00,880
 the husband would often put a lost and found advert

348
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:02,240
 in the local newspaper.

349
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:03,760
 (audience laughs)

350
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:05,280
 And this is the thing that happened.

351
00:12:05,280 --> 00:12:08,760
 And it's the thing that happened in the 1700s,

352
00:12:08,760 --> 00:12:11,480
 but it happened all the way to 1980.

353
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:15,680
 But the golden age of it was in, I mean golden age, yeah.

354
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:17,480
 What's the opposite of a golden age?

355
00:12:17,480 --> 00:12:18,560
 - Shitty age.

356
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:19,560
 (audience laughs)

357
00:12:19,560 --> 00:12:22,040
 - The shitty age of it was the 1700s.

358
00:12:22,040 --> 00:12:25,560
 And there's a blog called georgineera.blogspot.com.

359
00:12:25,560 --> 00:12:27,840
 And they've collected a load of examples from history.

360
00:12:27,840 --> 00:12:30,640
 So they've got one from the leads intelligentsia

361
00:12:30,640 --> 00:12:34,720
 from 1797, one from the Chester Chronicle of 1799.

362
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:37,080
 And basically for more than 300 years,

363
00:12:37,080 --> 00:12:40,080
 if your wife left you, you might put an advert

364
00:12:40,080 --> 00:12:42,240
 in the newspaper saying you basically

365
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:44,800
 be no longer responsible for her debts.

366
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:45,640
 - Yeah.

367
00:12:45,640 --> 00:12:46,480
 - Basically.

368
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:47,480
 - Because husbands basically were responsible

369
00:12:47,480 --> 00:12:48,840
 for paying for their wives at all times, weren't they?

370
00:12:48,840 --> 00:12:50,880
 So if your wife screwed up like that,

371
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:52,400
 then you were like, I'm not responsible for that.

372
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:53,240
 - Yeah.

373
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:56,200
 - The thing was, people did this thinking it was a legal thing

374
00:12:56,200 --> 00:12:57,040
 that would help them out.

375
00:12:57,040 --> 00:12:59,280
 Actually, it had no legal basis whatsoever.

376
00:12:59,280 --> 00:13:01,320
 Maybe in colonial times in America for a show

377
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:02,720
 I'm out of time, it might have worked,

378
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:04,880
 but certainly not in 1980, it wouldn't have worked.

379
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:06,040
 (audience laughs)

380
00:13:06,040 --> 00:13:07,440
 And the phrasing was always the same.

381
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:08,960
 It was, my wife is not here anymore.

382
00:13:08,960 --> 00:13:09,840
 She's left the house.

383
00:13:09,840 --> 00:13:12,520
 I will not pay for any of her debts.

384
00:13:12,520 --> 00:13:15,480
 It's a bit like, you know, you know on Twitter

385
00:13:15,480 --> 00:13:18,120
 where it says like retweets are not endorsements.

386
00:13:18,120 --> 00:13:19,760
 And everyone thinks that's a legal thing

387
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:22,520
 that will save them if they do anything.

388
00:13:22,520 --> 00:13:23,960
 And it absolutely won't.

389
00:13:23,960 --> 00:13:24,800
 - Oh no.

390
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:25,640
 - Well, this is exactly the same thing.

391
00:13:25,640 --> 00:13:26,480
 - What?

392
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:27,480
 (audience laughs)

393
00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:29,960
 - I've been retweeting some pretty bad egg-based accounts.

394
00:13:29,960 --> 00:13:31,200
 (audience laughs)

395
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:32,520
 And they did all have the same wording,

396
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:34,320
 but some of them got pretty funky with the language.

397
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:35,160
 Only a few.

398
00:13:35,160 --> 00:13:37,760
 So I found one from 1841, which said,

399
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:39,960
 "Whereas Fanny Martin has, without calls,

400
00:13:39,960 --> 00:13:42,640
 "left my habitation and is floating on the ocean

401
00:13:42,640 --> 00:13:44,400
 "of tyrannical extravagance.

402
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:45,960
 (audience laughs)

403
00:13:45,960 --> 00:13:49,480
 "Pro to prodigality, taking a wild goose chase

404
00:13:49,480 --> 00:13:52,920
 "and kindling her pipe with the call of curiosity."

405
00:13:52,920 --> 00:13:55,520
 (audience laughs)

406
00:13:55,520 --> 00:13:57,680
 (audience laughs)

407
00:13:57,680 --> 00:13:58,960
 - Amazing.

408
00:13:58,960 --> 00:14:01,000
 - That's a great tagline for our show, isn't it?

409
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,200
 - Oh yeah.

410
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:05,360
 - What was it kindling your pipe with the call of curiosity?

411
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:06,680
 (audience laughs)

412
00:14:06,680 --> 00:14:09,120
 - But the women used to get understandably quite annoyed

413
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:10,880
 'cause often they'd left their husbands

414
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:13,120
 for totally justified reasons.

415
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:15,400
 Even though in all of these ads, as James says,

416
00:14:15,400 --> 00:14:17,920
 they all the ad said, without just calls.

417
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:21,360
 And so the women started coming back from the very early days

418
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:23,920
 and posting their own ads in newspapers,

419
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:25,680
 actually explaining why they'd done this.

420
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:29,440
 So for instance, in 1810, there was a woman called Elizabeth Dick

421
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:31,200
 and her husband had put this advert out saying,

422
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:32,440
 "No, it's not a funny name.

423
00:14:32,440 --> 00:14:33,280
 "Come on."

424
00:14:33,280 --> 00:14:34,640
 (audience laughs)

425
00:14:34,640 --> 00:14:35,480
 - How are you Fanny?

426
00:14:35,480 --> 00:14:38,600
 - Her husband had said that she'd gone without just calls.

427
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:40,200
 And so she posted an advert in the paper,

428
00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:41,600
 a couple of weeks later, saying,

429
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:44,120
 "It is true that I left my husband's bed and board,

430
00:14:44,120 --> 00:14:47,040
 "but not before he made several attempts to murder me."

431
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:49,880
 (audience laughs)

432
00:14:49,880 --> 00:14:50,960
 - It used to do weird things.

433
00:14:50,960 --> 00:14:52,520
 The my favorite thing that I read about this,

434
00:14:52,520 --> 00:14:54,280
 if there was a sort of marital dispute,

435
00:14:54,280 --> 00:14:57,400
 there used to be a thing which was marital jewels.

436
00:14:57,400 --> 00:14:58,720
 Have you heard of that?

437
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:01,520
 So it's, you know, classic pistols at dawn,

438
00:15:01,520 --> 00:15:05,560
 except this was husband versus wife to sort out an argument.

439
00:15:05,560 --> 00:15:07,920
 And there were specific rules about the marital jewel

440
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:09,280
 that you had to hear by.

441
00:15:09,280 --> 00:15:12,720
 So the basic rules were that you would go to the place,

442
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:14,360
 there would be an adjudicator.

443
00:15:14,360 --> 00:15:17,200
 The wife was armed with three rocks

444
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:19,440
 and that she could wrap them around in cloth

445
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:22,000
 to swing and hit the husband with.

446
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,200
 And this is in the 1200s.

447
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:28,280
 The man basically had wooden clubs,

448
00:15:28,280 --> 00:15:30,640
 but he had to have a disadvantage to the fight.

449
00:15:30,640 --> 00:15:33,480
 So his disadvantage was he had to have one arm tied

450
00:15:33,480 --> 00:15:36,080
 behind his back and he had to fight the jewel

451
00:15:36,080 --> 00:15:38,400
 from within a three-foot hole in the ground.

452
00:15:38,400 --> 00:15:40,560
 (audience laughs)

453
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:43,920
 So he would be sat whacking away

454
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:46,760
 and she could stand, he could never leave the hole

455
00:15:46,760 --> 00:15:49,720
 and she could run around and smack him with her rocks.

456
00:15:49,720 --> 00:15:52,040
 And that was a real thing,

457
00:15:52,040 --> 00:15:56,320
 and there's countless accounts of the marital jewel happening.

458
00:15:56,320 --> 00:15:57,640
 We should bring that back.

459
00:15:57,640 --> 00:16:02,640
 - As a married man, I don't think we should bring that back.

460
00:16:02,640 --> 00:16:03,800
 - Yeah, why did I say that?

461
00:16:03,800 --> 00:16:05,280
 - We should certainly bring it back as a game.

462
00:16:05,280 --> 00:16:07,800
 I mean, that is a fun game, you're standing in a hole.

463
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:10,520
 You've got, maybe let's make the club out of foam or something.

464
00:16:10,520 --> 00:16:12,560
 - That's like a channel five game show, isn't it?

465
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:13,400
 - Yeah.

466
00:16:13,400 --> 00:16:18,200
 - I forgot to tell you guys, I had a marital argument this morning

467
00:16:18,200 --> 00:16:19,720
 but you forgot to tell us.

468
00:16:19,720 --> 00:16:20,720
 (audience laughs)

469
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:22,120
 - It's something I didn't realize I did.

470
00:16:22,120 --> 00:16:23,840
 I woke up in the morning and I was like,

471
00:16:23,840 --> 00:16:24,680
 "You okay?"

472
00:16:24,680 --> 00:16:27,200
 And she said, "You slept all class night."

473
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:28,640
 I was like, "Did I?"

474
00:16:28,640 --> 00:16:29,640
 What did I say?

475
00:16:29,640 --> 00:16:32,920
 She said, "You said, "I have many secrets."

476
00:16:32,920 --> 00:16:35,680
 (audience laughs)

477
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:38,520
 And that was it.

478
00:16:38,520 --> 00:16:41,720
 She was up for the rest of the night.

479
00:16:41,720 --> 00:16:44,240
 I was like, "He's fucking secrets."

480
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:45,400
 Done.

481
00:16:45,400 --> 00:16:46,720
 She knows about the egg stealing.

482
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:48,960
 (audience laughs)

483
00:16:48,960 --> 00:16:52,480
 - So I was looking at classified adverts in the newspaper.

484
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:54,280
 That's the thing that happens.

485
00:16:54,280 --> 00:16:57,400
 So classified adverts were an enormous thing.

486
00:16:57,400 --> 00:16:59,440
 You know, they kept loads of newspapers going

487
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:00,640
 in the days before Craigslist

488
00:17:00,640 --> 00:17:02,600
 and whatever people use these days.

489
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:06,080
 But the London Review of Books used to have

490
00:17:06,080 --> 00:17:09,080
 the greatest personal's adverts to find love

491
00:17:09,080 --> 00:17:10,440
 out of any publication.

492
00:17:10,440 --> 00:17:13,280
 And people used to collect these and read them avidly.

493
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:15,960
 So they included things like,

494
00:17:15,960 --> 00:17:18,120
 these are all complete ones, by the way.

495
00:17:18,120 --> 00:17:20,000
 Angry troll up, 37.

496
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:20,840
 Offers?

497
00:17:20,840 --> 00:17:23,840
 (audience laughs)

498
00:17:23,840 --> 00:17:26,840
 Amazing.

499
00:17:26,840 --> 00:17:27,920
 There was another one.

500
00:17:27,920 --> 00:17:30,920
 Less Venus in first, more Derek in Bucksdon.

501
00:17:30,920 --> 00:17:32,680
 (audience laughs)

502
00:17:32,680 --> 00:17:33,520
 Interested?

503
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:34,520
 Right.

504
00:17:34,520 --> 00:17:36,080
 Right to Derek in Bucksdon.

505
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:37,760
 (audience laughs)

506
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:39,960
 And this is my favorite, favorite, favorite, favorite one.

507
00:17:39,960 --> 00:17:43,440
 Vegan love God on the brink of mental and physical collapse,

508
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:47,520
 male 26, seeks pallid calcium deficient female

509
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:49,640
 for nights of apathy, depression, and headaches

510
00:17:49,640 --> 00:17:51,360
 while touring the moral high ground.

511
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:54,880
 (audience laughs)

512
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:56,320
 - So you mentioned Craigslist.

513
00:17:56,320 --> 00:17:58,280
 They have some really funny postings that have gone up

514
00:17:58,280 --> 00:17:59,280
 and a lot of them are jokes.

515
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:01,040
 But some of them, I was reading through, you know,

516
00:18:01,040 --> 00:18:03,680
 their best ones they've had.

517
00:18:03,680 --> 00:18:06,240
 And some of them I think are real and incredibly sad.

518
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:08,960
 So this was one posting on Craigslist a few years ago.

519
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:11,480
 I need someone to hide Easter eggs in my apartment

520
00:18:11,480 --> 00:18:12,720
 when I'm not there.

521
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:14,440
 They are small and filled with candy.

522
00:18:14,440 --> 00:18:16,360
 I would like to find them myself on Sunday.

523
00:18:16,360 --> 00:18:19,480
 I am willing to pay serious enquiries only.

524
00:18:19,480 --> 00:18:21,080
 You want someone to, I know.

525
00:18:21,080 --> 00:18:22,840
 - I mean, it sounds like someone weaning them

526
00:18:22,840 --> 00:18:24,360
 self off ex stealing, doesn't it?

527
00:18:24,360 --> 00:18:25,200
 (audience laughs)

528
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:27,600
 Please, please, please ignore the rumful

529
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:29,720
 of 10,000 eggs with mismatched labels.

530
00:18:29,720 --> 00:18:31,200
 (audience laughs)

531
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:33,080
 And the man dressed as a crow in a car.

532
00:18:33,080 --> 00:18:35,640
 (audience laughs)

533
00:18:35,640 --> 00:18:36,640
 - There was another one.

534
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:39,360
 There was one about a man who claimed

535
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:41,280
 that he'd robbed a woman's purse.

536
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:43,640
 But then he'd caught her eye after he was robbing it.

537
00:18:43,640 --> 00:18:44,680
 So he'd mugged a woman.

538
00:18:44,680 --> 00:18:46,400
 He'd then he'd put an ad on Craigslist saying,

539
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:48,320
 "Hi, I mugged you the other day."

540
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:50,000
 But then I caught your eye.

541
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,840
 There was a quick moment when our eyes met

542
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:53,400
 and I felt something strong.

543
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:54,880
 I think you felt it too.

544
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:55,880
 (audience laughs)

545
00:18:55,880 --> 00:18:59,240
 If I wasn't so shy, brackets also committing a crime.

546
00:18:59,240 --> 00:19:00,760
 Close brackets.

547
00:19:00,760 --> 00:19:02,400
 I would have asked your name.

548
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:03,840
 I, of course, later got your name

549
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:05,200
 from your driver's license.

550
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:08,160
 (audience laughs)

551
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:11,240
 So Jennifer, if you'd like to get together for a drink,

552
00:19:11,240 --> 00:19:12,400
 please call me.

553
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:14,200
 - I'm made. - I'm outside your front door.

554
00:19:14,200 --> 00:19:15,680
 (audience laughs)

555
00:19:15,680 --> 00:19:16,720
 Do you know that Guns and Roses

556
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:18,400
 got together through a personal's advert?

557
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:19,520
 - Did they? - Yeah.

558
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:21,600
 So there was, this used to be a thing

559
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:22,680
 for bands getting together.

560
00:19:22,680 --> 00:19:24,400
 So they were posted in music magazines

561
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:25,640
 and obviously which have a music you like,

562
00:19:25,640 --> 00:19:27,040
 you posted in that magazine.

563
00:19:27,040 --> 00:19:28,920
 So the advert said, "Base player needed

564
00:19:28,920 --> 00:19:31,600
 "for band influenced by Aerosmith, Alice Cooper."

565
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:32,880
 - Call slash.

566
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:34,000
 - Oh, what? - Call slash.

567
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:34,840
 - Call slash.

568
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:37,160
 - And they used to put the holes in the enemy,

569
00:19:37,160 --> 00:19:38,000
 didn't they quite a lot?

570
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,080
 I remember when I was growing up

571
00:19:39,080 --> 00:19:40,520
 and of course that's closed down today.

572
00:19:40,520 --> 00:19:41,680
 - Just today. - Yeah.

573
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:42,520
 - What?

574
00:19:42,520 --> 00:19:43,920
 - Last issue goes out on Friday.

575
00:19:43,920 --> 00:19:44,760
 - You joking.

576
00:19:44,760 --> 00:19:45,600
 - No jokes.

577
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:47,200
 - Last chance if you want to get in a band, Andy.

578
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:48,800
 (audience laughs)

579
00:19:48,800 --> 00:19:49,840
 - I thought I was in one.

580
00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:50,680
 (audience laughs)

581
00:19:50,680 --> 00:19:52,400
 So it was a weird sort of vocal band.

582
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:54,640
 (audience laughs)

583
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:56,400
 - I think there's a problem in classifieds, right?

584
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:57,880
 When people are looking into the history of them

585
00:19:57,880 --> 00:20:00,040
 'cause you don't get any other extra information.

586
00:20:00,040 --> 00:20:02,520
 So there's this really good looking book,

587
00:20:02,520 --> 00:20:04,880
 which is called "Found Strange Red Cow."

588
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:08,800
 And it's called that because it's related to an advert

589
00:20:08,800 --> 00:20:11,960
 that was placed in the Pennsylvania Gazette in the 19th century

590
00:20:11,960 --> 00:20:14,120
 which said, "Found Strange Red Cow."

591
00:20:14,120 --> 00:20:15,480
 And it was about a cow that wandered

592
00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:16,440
 onto someone's property

593
00:20:16,440 --> 00:20:19,120
 and will return to owner who proves that they own it.

594
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:22,280
 But another example of one of the ads in this book

595
00:20:22,280 --> 00:20:24,640
 is 1892 in New York.

596
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:27,800
 Wanted a young lady of German parentage

597
00:20:27,800 --> 00:20:30,240
 must be 36 inch bust

598
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:32,960
 and understand bookkeeping on a small scale.

599
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:33,960
 (audience laughs)

600
00:20:33,960 --> 00:20:36,040
 - What job requires?

601
00:20:36,040 --> 00:20:37,600
 All of those very specific issues.

602
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:38,800
 - But I'm willing to compromise

603
00:20:38,800 --> 00:20:40,920
 on the bookkeeping on a small scale.

604
00:20:40,920 --> 00:20:43,760
 (audience laughs)

605
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:46,000
 - Okay, move on to fact number three.

606
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:47,240
 And that is my fact.

607
00:20:47,240 --> 00:20:50,080
 My fact this week is that there is a bell

608
00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:55,080
 that's been ringing in Oxford nonstop for 178 years.

609
00:20:55,080 --> 00:20:57,720
 Yeah.

610
00:20:57,720 --> 00:20:59,480
 - Yeah, you guys must be pissed off about that.

611
00:20:59,480 --> 00:21:00,320
 - Yeah.

612
00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:01,160
 - Sounds really annoying.

613
00:21:01,160 --> 00:21:02,840
 - The hometown fact or where we're recording

614
00:21:02,840 --> 00:21:03,800
 or home city fact.

615
00:21:03,800 --> 00:21:06,600
 It's, this is in the Clarendon Laboratory.

616
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:09,040
 It's a 10 minute walk from where we are right now.

617
00:21:09,040 --> 00:21:11,440
 And back in 1840, they set this up

618
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:14,720
 with a new experimental battery that they wanted to test out.

619
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:16,280
 And effectively, it's two batteries

620
00:21:16,280 --> 00:21:18,920
 and a little bell hanging between

621
00:21:18,920 --> 00:21:21,400
 and it oscillates and just goes between the two bells.

622
00:21:21,400 --> 00:21:23,240
 And they thought it would last for a while.

623
00:21:23,240 --> 00:21:25,640
 But since 1840, it has not stopped.

624
00:21:25,640 --> 00:21:26,480
 It is still going.

625
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:27,560
 I visited it today.

626
00:21:27,560 --> 00:21:28,400
 You can go and see it.

627
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:29,240
 - Oh, did you?

628
00:21:29,240 --> 00:21:31,120
 - And you look really close and it's just tingling, tingling.

629
00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:32,720
 - It's just tiny here at Dinging.

630
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:33,880
 - No, I made the noise.

631
00:21:33,880 --> 00:21:38,120
 It's behind two bits of very thick glass

632
00:21:38,120 --> 00:21:39,840
 and then it's in a thicker, a bit of glass

633
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:41,120
 even so once you get to it.

634
00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:42,440
 - I don't know it's Dinging then.

635
00:21:42,440 --> 00:21:43,480
 - 'Cause I made the noise.

636
00:21:43,480 --> 00:21:47,840
 - We don't know what noise it's making if any,

637
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:49,160
 but you can see it physically.

638
00:21:49,160 --> 00:21:50,640
 - Well, it's likely to be a Dinging.

639
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:51,560
 - It's one of those things when you see it.

640
00:21:51,560 --> 00:21:52,600
 You're like, tingling, tingling.

641
00:21:52,600 --> 00:21:55,120
 It's got the motion of that.

642
00:21:55,120 --> 00:21:57,440
 And yeah, so this has been going

643
00:21:57,440 --> 00:21:58,360
 and it's battery powered.

644
00:21:58,360 --> 00:21:59,520
 This is what's most impressive.

645
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:02,440
 It's not as if it's a perpetual motion or anything.

646
00:22:02,440 --> 00:22:04,200
 Which would actually be more impressive.

647
00:22:04,200 --> 00:22:05,040
 - Yeah.

648
00:22:05,040 --> 00:22:09,640
 - Given how that would break the laws of the universe.

649
00:22:09,640 --> 00:22:13,960
 - No, I don't want to show this over the science first.

650
00:22:13,960 --> 00:22:16,000
 It's another perpetual motion thing I've built.

651
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:19,280
 - The problem is is that because they don't know

652
00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:21,720
 the exact composer of what's going inside it,

653
00:22:21,720 --> 00:22:23,640
 they need to just leave it

654
00:22:23,640 --> 00:22:26,280
 because the experiment now is how long will this go for.

655
00:22:26,280 --> 00:22:27,720
 It's like Schroddinger's battery.

656
00:22:27,720 --> 00:22:31,520
 If you touch it and go in, you ruin the experiment.

657
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:33,520
 So yeah, so they're just going to wait it out.

658
00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:34,680
 It's a long-term experiment.

659
00:22:34,680 --> 00:22:37,240
 - The best guess is that it's 2,000 alternate layers

660
00:22:37,240 --> 00:22:40,720
 of metal foil and paper coated with manganese dioxide

661
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:43,200
 and honey compressed into a glass tube

662
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:46,200
 and sealed from humidity in a casing of sulphur.

663
00:22:46,200 --> 00:22:47,040
 - Honey!

664
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:47,880
 - That is, honey.

665
00:22:47,880 --> 00:22:49,200
 - That's a good guess, isn't it?

666
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:51,920
 (all laughing)

667
00:22:51,920 --> 00:22:54,680
 - You were close, but it was peanut butter.

668
00:22:54,680 --> 00:22:57,200
 (all laughing)

669
00:22:57,200 --> 00:22:59,920
 I just find it amazing that this stuff doesn't erode,

670
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:04,240
 which I know metals are very erosion proof,

671
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:09,240
 but the clapper has struck the bell 10,911,456,000 times

672
00:23:09,240 --> 00:23:12,960
 since it started.

673
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:15,640
 That's like almost 11 billion times.

674
00:23:15,640 --> 00:23:18,440
 - Yeah, they think that the physical bell will break

675
00:23:18,440 --> 00:23:20,320
 before the battery itself breaks.

676
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:22,280
 'Cause there's a lot of metallic dust at the bottom,

677
00:23:22,280 --> 00:23:25,040
 isn't there, where it's kind of eroded over time?

678
00:23:25,040 --> 00:23:25,880
 - Yeah.

679
00:23:25,880 --> 00:23:27,920
 - But you know what, this experiment is called

680
00:23:27,920 --> 00:23:30,040
 the Oxford Dry Pile experiment

681
00:23:30,040 --> 00:23:32,600
 and it's been going longer than physics.

682
00:23:32,600 --> 00:23:35,400
 (all laughing)

683
00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:38,200
 By which I mean that it was bought in 1840,

684
00:23:38,200 --> 00:23:40,760
 like you say, by Reverend Robert Walker

685
00:23:40,760 --> 00:23:43,600
 and he was a reader in experimental philosophy

686
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:45,760
 and that's what they called physics back then.

687
00:23:45,760 --> 00:23:47,760
 So it's before you had physics professors.

688
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:48,600
 - Yeah, wow.

689
00:23:48,600 --> 00:23:49,440
 - That's cool, isn't it?

690
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:50,280
 - That is cool.

691
00:23:50,280 --> 00:23:52,960
 - Also, the battery was effectively made in 1825.

692
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:56,280
 They started ringing it as a bell in 1840,

693
00:23:56,280 --> 00:23:59,160
 but Walter, with the first batteries, was 1800.

694
00:23:59,160 --> 00:24:02,200
 So in 25 years, they created a battery

695
00:24:02,200 --> 00:24:05,600
 that is still running today and just nailed it.

696
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:07,200
 - I imagine when it stops, they'll be like,

697
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:08,400
 have you tried rubbing it?

698
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:11,160
 (all laughing)

699
00:24:11,160 --> 00:24:12,000
 - I think we should say,

700
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:13,120
 'cause I think there's been a few moments

701
00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:17,000
 where it has stopped due to humidity and stuff like that,

702
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:18,400
 but it's always come back on.

703
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:20,520
 - Does anyone else have a problem with dry pile being

704
00:24:20,520 --> 00:24:22,040
 a way for this incredible?

705
00:24:22,040 --> 00:24:23,520
 - Terrible problem with dry piles.

706
00:24:23,520 --> 00:24:24,960
 (all laughing)

707
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:28,200
 My notes are all about completely different stuff, actually.

708
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:30,120
 It's mostly a list of pharmacists

709
00:24:30,120 --> 00:24:31,680
 that I've visited today.

710
00:24:31,680 --> 00:24:33,840
 (all laughing)

711
00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:35,080
 - It's an unfortunate name

712
00:24:35,080 --> 00:24:37,720
 who was an extremely important piece of, you know,

713
00:24:37,720 --> 00:24:40,440
 physical progress, but the Voltaic pile

714
00:24:40,440 --> 00:24:45,440
 invented by Volta of voltage fame is what it's basically based on.

715
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:48,080
 And I didn't actually realize how they worked,

716
00:24:48,080 --> 00:24:51,360
 but basically it's just the Voltaic pile

717
00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:54,400
 is alternating layers of two different types of metal.

718
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:58,920
 And if you've got metals of two different chemical components,

719
00:24:58,920 --> 00:25:00,760
 then charge will travel between them.

720
00:25:00,760 --> 00:25:03,480
 If you put like salty watery paper between them,

721
00:25:03,480 --> 00:25:05,320
 so that allows electricity to conduct,

722
00:25:05,320 --> 00:25:07,200
 'cause you've got this watery salty paper.

723
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:10,680
 So the metal slightly dissolves into that paper.

724
00:25:10,680 --> 00:25:12,080
 And then when they touch each other,

725
00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:14,680
 then the current travels through them

726
00:25:14,680 --> 00:25:16,120
 and a circuit is created.

727
00:25:16,120 --> 00:25:18,560
 So it's just a pile of metal with a wet paper in between.

728
00:25:18,560 --> 00:25:19,400
 - It was bizarre.

729
00:25:19,400 --> 00:25:20,400
 - That's electricity.

730
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:23,640
 - And he's the guy who demonstrated electricity

731
00:25:23,640 --> 00:25:26,840
 first by electrocuting loads of frogs, right?

732
00:25:26,840 --> 00:25:28,280
 Volta, so he--

733
00:25:28,280 --> 00:25:29,640
 - And Galvani as well.

734
00:25:29,640 --> 00:25:33,160
 - And Galvani, so these were the two electricity pioneers

735
00:25:33,160 --> 00:25:34,520
 of the early 19th century.

736
00:25:34,520 --> 00:25:36,120
 And they were kind of for this fight,

737
00:25:36,120 --> 00:25:39,280
 because Volta used to put two different types of metal

738
00:25:39,280 --> 00:25:40,880
 on a dead frog's leg.

739
00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:42,360
 And the frog's leg would twitch.

740
00:25:42,360 --> 00:25:44,480
 And he'd say, look, that shows that these two different metals

741
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:45,600
 are creating electricity.

742
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:48,960
 And Galvani, from where we get the word Galvanise,

743
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:51,680
 said, no, no, it's because the frog's leg

744
00:25:51,680 --> 00:25:53,640
 is generating electricity.

745
00:25:53,640 --> 00:25:56,040
 And he thought that dead animal, you know,

746
00:25:56,040 --> 00:25:58,280
 bit created electricity.

747
00:25:58,280 --> 00:25:59,400
 So he turns out he was wrong.

748
00:25:59,400 --> 00:26:01,680
 - But we could have had a world where instead of a battery,

749
00:26:01,680 --> 00:26:03,440
 you have to shove a dead frog's leg

750
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:05,120
 into the back of your torch.

751
00:26:05,120 --> 00:26:06,120
 - A better world.

752
00:26:06,120 --> 00:26:07,200
 - A better world.

753
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:08,200
 (laughing)

754
00:26:08,200 --> 00:26:09,640
 - Do you know Volta did an experiment

755
00:26:09,640 --> 00:26:11,880
 just after he invented the Voltaic pile

756
00:26:11,880 --> 00:26:14,960
 where he found out that electricity takes sour.

757
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:17,240
 And the way that he did this was he got a number of volunteers

758
00:26:17,240 --> 00:26:18,600
 to form a chain.

759
00:26:18,600 --> 00:26:21,040
 And they each pinched the tongue of the person,

760
00:26:21,040 --> 00:26:22,640
 I won't do it Andy, don't worry.

761
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:24,080
 Of the person next to them.

762
00:26:24,080 --> 00:26:26,880
 And so they were all in a chain pinching each other's tongue.

763
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:29,840
 And then he put some electricity going through them.

764
00:26:29,840 --> 00:26:31,680
 And everyone could taste the fingers

765
00:26:31,680 --> 00:26:34,320
 of the person next to them going sour.

766
00:26:34,320 --> 00:26:35,160
 - Really?

767
00:26:35,160 --> 00:26:36,320
 - That's a good experiment.

768
00:26:36,320 --> 00:26:38,440
 - But how do you get the volunteers for that

769
00:26:38,440 --> 00:26:39,680
 in your class of mind ever?

770
00:26:39,680 --> 00:26:42,720
 Wanted, what are the volunteers for wacky stuff?

771
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:43,560
 (laughing)

772
00:26:43,560 --> 00:26:44,640
 Actually, we don't have electricity.

773
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:46,640
 And he'd say, come and taste my fingers.

774
00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:48,800
 (laughing)

775
00:26:48,800 --> 00:26:50,440
 Taste my finger was the Victorian equivalent

776
00:26:50,440 --> 00:26:51,640
 of pull my finger actually.

777
00:26:51,640 --> 00:26:53,200
 (laughing)

778
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:55,480
 - Do you know, just on how batteries work

779
00:26:55,480 --> 00:26:58,320
 and how, you know, electrical current flows.

780
00:26:58,320 --> 00:27:00,880
 In the 19th century, there were a lot of cases

781
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:02,840
 of exploding teeth.

782
00:27:02,840 --> 00:27:05,480
 And I know it sounds like those two sentences are unrelated.

783
00:27:05,480 --> 00:27:08,040
 But they've realized, people have realized

784
00:27:08,040 --> 00:27:09,680
 that the most likely explanation for this

785
00:27:09,680 --> 00:27:11,080
 is that people used to have teeth

786
00:27:11,080 --> 00:27:12,680
 that were made of metal, obviously.

787
00:27:12,680 --> 00:27:14,960
 And they would often be two different types of metal.

788
00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:16,920
 And there were all these dentist records

789
00:27:16,920 --> 00:27:18,680
 and doctors records of exploding teeth.

790
00:27:18,680 --> 00:27:21,040
 Like, people would be in huge amounts of pain.

791
00:27:21,040 --> 00:27:22,800
 And they'd feel like there was an electric current

792
00:27:22,800 --> 00:27:23,920
 going into their gums.

793
00:27:23,920 --> 00:27:25,480
 And then their teeth would explode.

794
00:27:25,480 --> 00:27:27,200
 And it's actually because they literally

795
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:29,280
 were turning their mouths into a battery.

796
00:27:29,280 --> 00:27:30,960
 So if you had these two different types of metal

797
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:32,280
 and they were making contact,

798
00:27:32,280 --> 00:27:34,400
 then there was a circuit running around your mouth.

799
00:27:34,400 --> 00:27:37,160
 - Well, and that's what happens if you have a filling

800
00:27:37,160 --> 00:27:38,280
 and you bite a bit of metal,

801
00:27:38,280 --> 00:27:39,760
 you're making a tiny little battery there,

802
00:27:39,760 --> 00:27:40,600
 aren't you? - Yeah.

803
00:27:40,600 --> 00:27:41,320
 - That's why that's so painful.

804
00:27:41,320 --> 00:27:42,160
 - Really?

805
00:27:42,160 --> 00:27:43,000
 - Yeah.

806
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:43,840
 - Is that painful?

807
00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:44,680
 - Yeah.

808
00:27:44,680 --> 00:27:47,240
 (laughing)

809
00:27:47,240 --> 00:27:48,720
 - I was looking a bit into,

810
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:50,240
 'cause this is a long-term experiment

811
00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:51,720
 that's been going on.

812
00:27:51,720 --> 00:27:53,320
 I just looked into long-term experiments.

813
00:27:53,320 --> 00:27:56,160
 And I found one which I thought was really interesting.

814
00:27:56,160 --> 00:27:59,040
 There was a paper that was published in 1998

815
00:27:59,040 --> 00:28:00,360
 and the title of it was,

816
00:28:00,360 --> 00:28:03,840
 "Does knuckle cracking lead to arthritis of the fingers?"

817
00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:08,160
 And this was written by a scientist called Donald Unger,

818
00:28:08,160 --> 00:28:12,080
 who basically for 60 years cracked his knuckles

819
00:28:12,080 --> 00:28:14,320
 in order to work out if it was arthritis

820
00:28:14,320 --> 00:28:15,720
 that you would get off the back of it.

821
00:28:15,720 --> 00:28:17,320
 He did it because when he was a kid,

822
00:28:17,320 --> 00:28:19,120
 his mother and his aunties said to him,

823
00:28:19,120 --> 00:28:21,360
 "Stop cracking your knuckles, you're gonna get arthritis."

824
00:28:21,360 --> 00:28:22,400
 And he thought, "No, I'm not."

825
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:25,320
 So he said, "60 years on the left hand alone,

826
00:28:25,320 --> 00:28:26,920
 cracking his knuckles."

827
00:28:26,920 --> 00:28:28,480
 And then he didn't crack his right hand.

828
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:29,320
 - Exactly.

829
00:28:29,320 --> 00:28:30,600
 So it started as a kid.

830
00:28:30,600 --> 00:28:33,080
 Just was like every day he would crack his knuckles

831
00:28:33,080 --> 00:28:34,600
 and he got to the end and his answer was,

832
00:28:34,600 --> 00:28:36,120
 "No, it doesn't give you arthritis."

833
00:28:36,120 --> 00:28:38,160
 - Although, that seems like a very petty thing

834
00:28:38,160 --> 00:28:40,800
 to spite your mother for 60 years.

835
00:28:40,800 --> 00:28:41,960
 - Yeah.

836
00:28:41,960 --> 00:28:43,440
 - It was an unhealthy relationship.

837
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:44,280
 - Okay.

838
00:28:44,280 --> 00:28:45,800
 I have done further papers and it turns out

839
00:28:45,800 --> 00:28:47,440
 the broccoli is not delicious.

840
00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:50,440
 (audience laughing)

841
00:28:50,440 --> 00:28:55,480
 And it turns out, I won't go blind if I keep doing that.

842
00:28:55,480 --> 00:28:59,160
 (audience laughing)

843
00:28:59,160 --> 00:29:00,520
 - Should we move on to our final fact?

844
00:29:00,520 --> 00:29:01,360
 - Yeah.

845
00:29:01,360 --> 00:29:03,680
 - Okay, it is our final fact of the show

846
00:29:03,680 --> 00:29:05,440
 and that is Andy.

847
00:29:05,440 --> 00:29:07,280
 - My fact is that King Edward VII

848
00:29:07,280 --> 00:29:10,440
 had a liquor invented specifically for him to drink

849
00:29:10,440 --> 00:29:11,640
 while driving.

850
00:29:11,640 --> 00:29:14,800
 (audience laughing)

851
00:29:14,800 --> 00:29:17,800
 This was very pretty health and safety.

852
00:29:17,800 --> 00:29:19,960
 So there's a drink, it's called the King's Ginger

853
00:29:19,960 --> 00:29:21,920
 'cause it was named for him.

854
00:29:21,920 --> 00:29:24,560
 He was the first monarch to drive a car.

855
00:29:24,560 --> 00:29:26,040
 He was driving from about 1898.

856
00:29:26,040 --> 00:29:27,280
 He was an early adopter.

857
00:29:27,280 --> 00:29:28,840
 He became King in 1901.

858
00:29:28,840 --> 00:29:31,400
 And he was a huge fan of drinking,

859
00:29:31,400 --> 00:29:34,120
 but he was driving around on quite chilly mores,

860
00:29:34,120 --> 00:29:35,320
 open top cars.

861
00:29:35,320 --> 00:29:38,000
 And his doctor, this is the story of the drink,

862
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:40,400
 was worried that he might get cold and chilly.

863
00:29:40,400 --> 00:29:43,520
 So instead of giving him medical advice,

864
00:29:43,520 --> 00:29:47,400
 he just asked a wine merchant to invent a new alcohol for him.

865
00:29:47,400 --> 00:29:49,920
 And it's very gingery and it's called King's Ginger.

866
00:29:49,920 --> 00:29:50,800
 - And it still exists, right?

867
00:29:50,800 --> 00:29:51,640
 - It still exists.

868
00:29:51,640 --> 00:29:54,200
 And actually, I've brought some along with me tonight.

869
00:29:54,200 --> 00:29:55,040
 - That's so good.

870
00:29:55,040 --> 00:29:57,000
 - My wine was literally about to run out.

871
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:58,480
 - Well, have you got a cup?

872
00:29:58,480 --> 00:29:59,960
 - I've got four.

873
00:29:59,960 --> 00:30:01,920
 I did try and find shot glasses in my house,

874
00:30:01,920 --> 00:30:04,880
 but due to my lifestyle, I've got one.

875
00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:08,000
 (audience laughing)

876
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:12,400
 I've then got two measuring shot glasses,

877
00:30:12,400 --> 00:30:14,760
 which he used for K&Pepa.

878
00:30:14,760 --> 00:30:15,840
 (audience laughing)

879
00:30:15,840 --> 00:30:18,320
 And I've got one shot glass I borrowed from the venue.

880
00:30:18,320 --> 00:30:19,280
 Thank you very much.

881
00:30:19,280 --> 00:30:20,720
 (audience laughing)

882
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:23,400
 So if you'd like to, oh, Cracky.

883
00:30:23,400 --> 00:30:24,720
 - I'm not driving home later.

884
00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:25,960
 Am I still allowed to drink it?

885
00:30:25,960 --> 00:30:27,800
 (audience laughing)

886
00:30:27,800 --> 00:30:30,600
 - We don't normally finish with alcohol consumption on stage.

887
00:30:30,600 --> 00:30:32,600
 Sorry, we normally start with it, but.

888
00:30:32,600 --> 00:30:34,320
 (audience laughing)

889
00:30:34,320 --> 00:30:36,320
 And it's shot at it, right.

890
00:30:36,320 --> 00:30:37,480
 - It was a shot glass.

891
00:30:37,480 --> 00:30:40,480
 (audience laughing)

892
00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:43,480
 (audience cheering)

893
00:30:43,480 --> 00:30:47,120
 - Okay, should we talk about facts and stuff?

894
00:30:47,120 --> 00:30:48,120
 - Yeah, sure.

895
00:30:48,120 --> 00:30:50,200
 - Oh yeah, ever the seventh.

896
00:30:50,200 --> 00:30:53,080
 He liked drinking, he liked generally having a good time,

897
00:30:53,080 --> 00:30:54,400
 didn't he, ever the seventh?

898
00:30:54,400 --> 00:30:57,880
 So old Bertie, one of the things he was famous for

899
00:30:57,880 --> 00:31:02,320
 was having a siège d'amour or a loft chair,

900
00:31:02,320 --> 00:31:05,720
 which is an item which I think still exists today,

901
00:31:05,720 --> 00:31:08,000
 but it was made for his own personal use,

902
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:10,320
 a brothel called Lushabane,

903
00:31:10,320 --> 00:31:12,440
 which was a very famous brothel in Paris.

904
00:31:12,440 --> 00:31:14,800
 And if you should look it up, the loft chair,

905
00:31:14,800 --> 00:31:16,600
 if ever the seventh, and apparently it's made for him

906
00:31:16,600 --> 00:31:18,920
 to have sex with two women at the same time.

907
00:31:18,920 --> 00:31:21,720
 It's a bizarre contraption, it's got stirrups on it,

908
00:31:21,720 --> 00:31:23,200
 it's got hand grips on it.

909
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:25,280
 I've steered it for about 45 minutes today,

910
00:31:25,280 --> 00:31:26,840
 and I cannot for the life of me work out

911
00:31:26,840 --> 00:31:28,760
 how you could have sex with one person.

912
00:31:28,760 --> 00:31:31,440
 - Let alone two, using this chair.

913
00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:32,440
 - But he was worried, wasn't he,

914
00:31:32,440 --> 00:31:35,320
 because he got quite massive later in life,

915
00:31:35,320 --> 00:31:37,560
 and so his main worry was he didn't,

916
00:31:37,560 --> 00:31:39,760
 he was having a lot of sex still with a lot of people,

917
00:31:39,760 --> 00:31:42,200
 and he didn't want to crush them while he was having sex.

918
00:31:42,200 --> 00:31:43,600
 That was his decision.

919
00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:48,000
 So the chair gave him the sort of the uncrushability

920
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:51,520
 that he was looking for when having a minasie toire.

921
00:31:51,520 --> 00:31:53,720
 - Yeah. - And can I just say quickly,

922
00:31:53,720 --> 00:31:55,320
 because I know we're in England,

923
00:31:55,320 --> 00:31:57,720
 and everyone knows who Edward the seventh is,

924
00:31:57,720 --> 00:32:00,280
 but as you know, there's little else spoken about

925
00:32:00,280 --> 00:32:03,320
 these days, contemporary national discourse.

926
00:32:03,320 --> 00:32:07,680
 But for international listeners, he was the son of Queen Victoria.

927
00:32:07,680 --> 00:32:11,600
 He was born in 1841, which, for context of this podcast,

928
00:32:11,600 --> 00:32:14,400
 was one year after the bell started ringing in Oxford.

929
00:32:14,400 --> 00:32:16,160
 (audience laughs)

930
00:32:16,160 --> 00:32:18,800
 And he was, yeah, he was known as Dirty Bertie.

931
00:32:18,800 --> 00:32:22,560
 He was such a odd character, but very influential as well.

932
00:32:22,560 --> 00:32:24,400
 A lot of things have gone through history

933
00:32:24,400 --> 00:32:27,000
 that are said to be, as a result of him,

934
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:30,200
 one we know for sure is the fact that the royals get two birthdays.

935
00:32:30,200 --> 00:32:31,600
 The Queen has two birthdays.

936
00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:32,920
 That's down to him.

937
00:32:32,920 --> 00:32:34,600
 Because his birthday was at a bad time.

938
00:32:34,600 --> 00:32:35,600
 It was in a wintery time.

939
00:32:35,600 --> 00:32:37,920
 So he said, "I want a more a summary one."

940
00:32:37,920 --> 00:32:39,840
 So he gave himself a second birthday.

941
00:32:39,840 --> 00:32:41,880
 So that's down to him.

942
00:32:41,880 --> 00:32:43,120
 Some royal drinks.

943
00:32:43,120 --> 00:32:44,000
 - Oh, yeah. - All right.

944
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:47,000
 - So you said Queen Victoria, who was his mother?

945
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:49,760
 - Yes. - Her favorite drink was whiskey

946
00:32:49,760 --> 00:32:52,200
 and red wine mixed together.

947
00:32:52,200 --> 00:32:53,040
 - Yeah, that's true.

948
00:32:53,040 --> 00:32:54,520
 I think we found out from Gladstone,

949
00:32:54,520 --> 00:32:56,880
 didn't we, a Prime Minister of the 19th century?

950
00:32:56,880 --> 00:32:59,360
 And yeah, he did not like the idea.

951
00:32:59,360 --> 00:33:03,120
 He wrote, "She has her claret strengthened,

952
00:33:03,120 --> 00:33:06,160
 "and I should have thought spoiled with whiskey,

953
00:33:06,160 --> 00:33:07,960
 "but that was her drink."

954
00:33:07,960 --> 00:33:10,640
 Kate Middleton likes crack, baby.

955
00:33:10,640 --> 00:33:14,000
 - Sorry. - Hey, never called me baby again.

956
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:16,640
 (laughing)

957
00:33:16,640 --> 00:33:19,400
 That was a very legally contentious statement, James.

958
00:33:19,400 --> 00:33:20,560
 It's a cocktail.

959
00:33:20,560 --> 00:33:21,400
 There's no crack in it.

960
00:33:21,400 --> 00:33:23,560
 It's called vodka, raspberry liqueur,

961
00:33:23,560 --> 00:33:25,280
 passion fruit and champagne.

962
00:33:25,280 --> 00:33:27,040
 It's called crack, baby.

963
00:33:27,040 --> 00:33:28,200
 That's one of her favorite drinks.

964
00:33:28,200 --> 00:33:30,000
 Did you know that there is a new drink

965
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:31,720
 that's been invented called a Voktail?

966
00:33:31,720 --> 00:33:32,920
 This is from last year.

967
00:33:32,920 --> 00:33:34,440
 It's by the University of Singapore

968
00:33:34,440 --> 00:33:36,240
 and it's a virtual cocktail.

969
00:33:36,240 --> 00:33:38,000
 So it's a special glass,

970
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:39,600
 which can make you think you're drinking alcohol,

971
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:41,240
 even though you're not.

972
00:33:41,240 --> 00:33:43,320
 - Sounds awful. - It's got three methods.

973
00:33:43,320 --> 00:33:45,680
 So you pour a liquid in, you pour just normal water in

974
00:33:45,680 --> 00:33:48,440
 and then there's a light that goes on in the glass.

975
00:33:48,440 --> 00:33:50,600
 So already you think, "Oh, it's a lovely red cocktail,"

976
00:33:50,600 --> 00:33:54,200
 whatever, then there are electrodes all around the rim

977
00:33:54,200 --> 00:33:55,880
 where you can alter the sweetness

978
00:33:55,880 --> 00:33:57,240
 or the saltiness or the bitterness

979
00:33:57,240 --> 00:33:59,440
 by stimulating the tongue with a small electric current,

980
00:33:59,440 --> 00:34:00,200
 like--

981
00:34:00,200 --> 00:34:02,040
 - Valter. - Yeah, man, vulter.

982
00:34:02,040 --> 00:34:03,920
 And finally, there's a tube in the side

983
00:34:03,920 --> 00:34:05,680
 which releases gases to make you think

984
00:34:05,680 --> 00:34:06,840
 that you're drinking something else.

985
00:34:06,840 --> 00:34:08,400
 So you can think you're drinking lemonade

986
00:34:08,400 --> 00:34:09,600
 even though you're drinking water.

987
00:34:09,600 --> 00:34:11,000
 And then do they smack you over the head

988
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:12,280
 so you have a headache in the morning?

989
00:34:12,280 --> 00:34:14,280
 (laughing)

990
00:34:14,280 --> 00:34:18,680
 Hey, we're gonna have to wrap up shortly.

991
00:34:18,680 --> 00:34:21,160
 Do you guys have anything before we do?

992
00:34:21,160 --> 00:34:22,200
 I've had so much kings to enjoy.

993
00:34:22,200 --> 00:34:23,560
 I can't really see any more, though.

994
00:34:23,560 --> 00:34:25,560
 (laughing)

995
00:34:26,560 --> 00:34:29,600
 I got one last thing which I really like,

996
00:34:29,600 --> 00:34:32,200
 which is that there's a lot of celebrity alcohols

997
00:34:32,200 --> 00:34:33,560
 that have been released over the years.

998
00:34:33,560 --> 00:34:37,760
 And my favorite, like ACDC, do wine, iron maiden, do beer,

999
00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:41,120
 Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie and Danny DeVito,

1000
00:34:41,120 --> 00:34:42,800
 they all have their different wines.

1001
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:44,840
 My favorite one is that the band Hanson,

1002
00:34:44,840 --> 00:34:46,680
 famous for the song "Umbop,"

1003
00:34:46,680 --> 00:34:50,000
 they released their own beer, which they called "Umbops."

1004
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:53,880
 And that's available at shops.

1005
00:34:53,880 --> 00:34:55,800
 It shops, I think you'll find it.

1006
00:34:55,800 --> 00:34:58,120
 (laughing)

1007
00:34:58,120 --> 00:34:59,280
 Okay, that is it.

1008
00:34:59,280 --> 00:35:00,360
 That is all of our facts.

1009
00:35:00,360 --> 00:35:01,760

 Andy.

1015
00:35:09,880 --> 00:35:11,080
 (speaking in foreign language)

1016
00:35:11,080 --> 00:35:13,000
 James Haken and Shazinski.

 You can email us at qa.com.

1021
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:20,920
 Nosuchthing is a fish.com.

1022

 We've got links to our tour.

1023
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:23,520
 We have links to our book.

1024
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:26,560
 We have links to this, well, very soon, hopefully,

1025
00:35:26,560 --> 00:35:29,320
 our cassette, when we're about to give one away.

1026
00:35:29,320 --> 00:35:30,880
 Because we ask the audience here in Oxford

1027
00:35:30,880 --> 00:35:32,600
 to give us a fact.

1028
00:35:32,600 --> 00:35:34,400
 Their favorite fact, James is picked a winner.

1029
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:38,080
 So the winner is, it is Ryan O'Reilly.

1030
00:35:38,080 --> 00:35:42,800
 The fact is that in 2005, Babu, a male red panda,

1031
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:46,440
 a Birmingham nature center in Birmingham, escaped.

1032
00:35:46,440 --> 00:35:49,720
 He was subsequently named Brummy of the Year.

1033
00:35:49,720 --> 00:35:52,040
 (laughing)

1034
00:35:53,400 --> 00:35:54,400
 Amazing.

1035
00:35:54,400 --> 00:35:55,800
 What for escaping Birmingham?

1036
00:35:55,800 --> 00:35:58,800
 (laughing)

1037
00:35:58,800 --> 00:36:01,480
 Ryan come find us outside at the end of the show.

1038
00:36:01,480 --> 00:36:02,680
 We'll give you a cassette.

1039
00:36:02,680 --> 00:36:05,120
 And this is, we're not selling them anywhere else.

1040
00:36:05,120 --> 00:36:06,880
 So if anyone wants one, they're going to be out in the foyer.

1041
00:36:06,880 --> 00:36:08,520
 We're going to be out there as well, signing them.

1042
00:36:08,520 --> 00:36:10,000
 Guys, thank you so much for being here.

1043
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:12,040
 We'll be back again next week with another episode.

1044
00:36:12,040 --> 00:36:12,880
 Goodbye.

1045
00:36:12,880 --> 00:36:15,880
 (audience cheering)

1046
00:36:15,880 --> 00:36:18,460
 (upbeat music)

1047
00:36:19,300 --> 00:36:22,300
 (audience cheering)

1048
00:36:22,300 --> 00:36:25,300
 (audience cheering)
