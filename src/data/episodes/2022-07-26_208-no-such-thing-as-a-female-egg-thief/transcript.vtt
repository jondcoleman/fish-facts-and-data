00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580
 (upbeat music)

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:05.640
 (speaking in foreign language)

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:08.040
 (upbeat music)

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:10.940
 (upbeat music)

00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:13.880
 - Hello and welcome to another episode

00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:16.020
 of No Such Thing as a Fish.

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:19.020
 (audience cheering)

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:22.660
 (speaking in foreign language)

00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:24.660
 from Oxford.

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:28.160
 (audience cheering)

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:29.400
 My name is Dan Schreiber.

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:31.480
 Here I am sitting here with Anna Chazinski,

00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:33.360
 Andrew Hunter Murray, and James Harkin.

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:35.600
 And once again, we have gathered around the microphones

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:38.080
 with our four favorite facts from the last seven days

00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:40.240
 and in no particular order, here we go.

00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:42.080
 Starting with you, Anna.

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:44.920
 - My fact this week is that the Victorian soldier,

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:48.600
 Major Charles Bendire, once braved enemy fire

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:50.280
 to get an egg from a tree,

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:52.680
 then held it in his mouth while he climbed down.

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:55.320
 And on finding that it was stuck inside his mouth,

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:57.320
 removed one of his teeth to free it.

00:00:57.320 --> 00:01:00.160
 (audience laughing)

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:01.000
 It's amazing.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:04.440
 - This is just egg collecting or egging, in fact,

00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:07.520
 was a really popular pursuit in the 19th century.

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:09.600
 And still some people do it today.

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:10.800
 And yeah, he was an egger.

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:13.520
 And it was thought of as quite a manly pursuit.

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:17.120
 It was very dangerous because like birds lay their eggs

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:19.240
 in precarious positions on cliff faces

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:20.960
 or really high up trees and stuff.

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:23.840
 So yeah, Major Charles Bendire got up there

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:26.640
 to prove his manhood and yeah, had to have his tooth removed.

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:28.880
 And he was being attacked by a patchies, wasn't he?

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:29.720
 - Yes.

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:30.880
 - This was an America.

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:34.080
 He was trying to get an egg of a zone-tailed hawk.

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:36.720
 And I looked to see how big those eggs are.

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:39.960
 And they are about three inches by two inches.

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:41.200
 Okay, so if you can imagine that.

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:43.120
 What, I've got my phone here.

00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:46.640
 The width of my phone, this is an iPhone 6s plus.

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:52.760
 This is about the same width as the egg.

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:53.960
 So I'm gonna put it in my mouth.

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:54.800
 Okay.

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:57.240
 - Wow.

00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:58.240
 - Wow.

00:01:58.240 --> 00:01:59.080
 - Listen to this at home.

00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:00.080
 This is incredible stuff.

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:03.760
 This is, I mean, the people of Oxford

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:05.800
 have never seen anyone deep-throw tonight before.

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:09.000
 (audience laughing)

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:10.080
 - Nobody has.

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:14.080
 - Please no one text me right now.

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:16.320
 (audience laughing)

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:18.640
 But anyway, that gives you an idea of how big the egg was.

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:21.240
 - That's the width of it.

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:23.640
 - Yes, so that's the length actually

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:24.720
 and the width is two inches.

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:26.440
 So it's a bit smaller, widthwise.

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:27.600
 It's egg-shaped.

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:28.440
 - Wait, is it okay?

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:31.240
 (audience laughing)

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:34.880
 - You therefore put it in kind of with the long end.

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:35.720
 - Yeah.

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:36.720
 - You put it in the wrong way round.

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:39.080
 - I know, but I'm terrible, Ega.

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:40.600
 But my feeling is that Charles Bendier

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:41.880
 might have done it that way, right?

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:44.000
 Because surely that's how it must have gotten stuck.

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:44.840
 - Maybe.

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:47.600
 - Well, I think also his jaw swallled up, swelled up.

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:50.160
 Due to being under fire, it was a very tense situation.

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:51.880
 And I think that made his jaw swell up a bit.

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:52.720
 Meaning that--

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:53.560
 - Is that what happens?

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:55.720
 - That's one account I read, and he had to get,

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:58.760
 so his men took it out under threat of court martial.

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:00.520
 He said, "I will court martial you if you don't..."

00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:01.360
 - How he went?

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:04.640
 (audience laughing)

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:05.480
 - Yeah.

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:06.640
 - And his tooth broke, didn't he?

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:08.920
 So it may not have been an entire tooth

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:11.240
 and his tooth broke as it was on the way out

00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:12.880
 or he insisted that it was broken

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:14.560
 to ensure that he retained the egg.

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:16.960
 - So, but burgers, no, sorry, Ega's,

00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:19.400
 who had dangerous times.

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:21.680
 There was another guy called Francis J. Britwell.

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:23.360
 I'm pretty sure this is 19th century.

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:26.160
 He was strangled by his own climbing rope,

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:28.800
 climbing to reach a nest in a tall pine tree

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:30.480
 on his honeymoon.

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:31.360
 (laughing)

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:33.840
 - Oh, yeah, that's a good honeymoon.

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:35.760
 - The other thing is that guy, I Googled him

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:37.440
 to see if there was anything else about him.

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:39.480
 And that seems to be literally the only thing

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:41.240
 we know about him.

00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:43.000
 - Imagine that, that's all you're known for,

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:44.520
 trying to get an egg on your honeymoon.

00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:45.520
 (laughing)

00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:47.560
 - He died doing what he loved,

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:49.040
 but not doing who he loved,

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:50.680
 which is what honeymoon's all about.

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:53.440
 (laughing)

00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:54.800
 - Miss the entire point.

00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:57.840
 - Yeah, but they get really obsessive, don't they,

00:03:57.840 --> 00:03:58.680
 these collectors?

00:03:58.680 --> 00:03:59.680
 - Yeah, and they still happen.

00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:01.680
 So, there's a society called the Jordan,

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:03.400
 Jordan, or Jordan Society,

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:05.960
 which is named after an egg collector of the 19th century.

00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:08.160
 And this sort of still exists,

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:09.480
 although they're honorary members now,

00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:12.400
 because it's actually illegal to take eggs out of bird's nest

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:16.640
 because it kind of damages birds' procreation cycles.

00:04:16.640 --> 00:04:18.040
 But yeah, there are loads of them around.

00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:23.000
 So, there's actually one of the UK's most prolific egg collectors

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:26.360
 called Colin Watson, who I think had more eggs than anyone else

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:28.920
 in the late '90s, and then they all got seized by the police.

00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:32.680
 But he died falling out of a tree in 2006.

00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:33.520
 - Oh, yeah.

00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:34.920
 - So again, still very risky.

00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:37.520
 - And he's supposedly been retired for years, right?

00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:38.360
 - Yeah.

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:39.440
 - Because he kept getting arrested,

00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:41.160
 so he said, "I'm no longer in the game."

00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:46.160
 And then, but he was on a watch list of 300 egg collectors.

00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:50.240
 So, there's a list where they come,

00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:52.320
 and they think you have it.

00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:53.320
 They raid your house.

00:04:53.320 --> 00:04:56.840
 - Oh, no, there was one guy who had 3,600 eggs in his house.

00:04:56.840 --> 00:05:00.520
 And when the RSPB smashed his door in with the police,

00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:02.600
 he said to them, "Thank God you've come.

00:05:02.600 --> 00:05:03.800
 I can't stop."

00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:06.080
 So, this is a real obsession that people have.

00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:06.920
 - Yeah, that's right.

00:05:06.920 --> 00:05:09.560
 And often it's the wives or the family who call the police,

00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:11.120
 don't they, or call the RSPB?

00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:12.800
 Because they're worried about their husbands,

00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:14.640
 and they always is husbands.

00:05:14.640 --> 00:05:21.520
 Literally every single person on this list is a male age between 25 and 45.

00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:24.880
 No woman has ever been convicted of eggs, eh?

00:05:24.880 --> 00:05:25.960
 - Oh, I guess.

00:05:25.960 --> 00:05:27.400
 - They're just better at it.

00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:28.400
 - Thank you.

00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:31.920
 - I do it all the time.

00:05:31.920 --> 00:05:33.680
 No one's ever caught me.

00:05:33.680 --> 00:05:36.440
 - There was a guy called Mervin Shorthouse in the '70s,

00:05:36.440 --> 00:05:38.800
 and so there's an egg collection at Trink,

00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:41.720
 which Walter Rothschild collected, thousands,

00:05:41.720 --> 00:05:43.800
 maybe I think hundreds of thousands of eggs.

00:05:43.800 --> 00:05:48.160
 But he broke in, and he posed as a wheelchair-bound invalid,

00:05:48.160 --> 00:05:53.720
 and he stole, over the course of three years, 10,000 eggs, 10,000.

00:05:53.720 --> 00:05:56.600
 I think that's about 10 a day for three years, every day,

00:05:56.600 --> 00:05:59.320
 including Christmas and your birthday.

00:05:59.320 --> 00:06:02.080
 And then he mixed up all the labels to apparently cover the theft.

00:06:02.080 --> 00:06:03.360
 I'm not sure how that covers the theft,

00:06:03.360 --> 00:06:05.640
 because you've been probably 10,000 eggs in your house.

00:06:05.640 --> 00:06:07.840
 - I've heard that with any museum thefts,

00:06:07.840 --> 00:06:12.080
 and any general theft where there's a label involved,

00:06:12.080 --> 00:06:15.280
 the biggest problem that any scientist cares about

00:06:15.280 --> 00:06:16.840
 is they don't care if a thing is stolen,

00:06:16.840 --> 00:06:19.280
 because most likely it will be recovered down the line.

00:06:19.280 --> 00:06:21.240
 A black market trade will reveal it somewhere

00:06:21.240 --> 00:06:22.520
 somewhere in a house.

00:06:22.520 --> 00:06:24.960
 It's when you remove the data that says what it was,

00:06:24.960 --> 00:06:26.600
 where it was, and how it was found.

00:06:26.600 --> 00:06:28.680
 That's the most important thing that goes missing,

00:06:28.680 --> 00:06:29.680
 the little label.

00:06:29.680 --> 00:06:30.520
 - Yeah, yeah.

00:06:30.520 --> 00:06:32.080
 - So we're saying steal what you like, but keep labels.

00:06:32.080 --> 00:06:32.920
 - Leave the labels.

00:06:32.920 --> 00:06:33.920
 - Yeah.

00:06:33.920 --> 00:06:36.200
 - steal the labels up, even worse.

00:06:36.200 --> 00:06:37.200
 - Yeah.

00:06:37.200 --> 00:06:38.440
 - So strong.

00:06:38.440 --> 00:06:41.160
 - It must have going into a museum where nothing was labeled.

00:06:41.160 --> 00:06:42.440
 You were just looking at stuff going,

00:06:42.440 --> 00:06:43.640
 "What the fuck is that?"

00:06:43.640 --> 00:06:45.080
 (audience laughs)

00:06:45.080 --> 00:06:45.920
 No idea.

00:06:45.920 --> 00:06:46.760
 Is it angel Egyptian?

00:06:46.760 --> 00:06:48.120
 Is it 1920s?

00:06:48.120 --> 00:06:50.200
 There was, it isn't quite gangster.

00:06:50.200 --> 00:06:51.960
 There's this amazing New Yorker article,

00:06:51.960 --> 00:06:53.320
 which I would really recommend,

00:06:53.320 --> 00:06:55.360
 which kind of goes through the long history

00:06:55.360 --> 00:06:57.480
 of egging kind of in the modern day.

00:06:57.480 --> 00:07:01.000
 And one of the things it describes is a raid in 1994,

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:03.360
 and this was by the RSPB,

00:07:03.360 --> 00:07:04.760
 the investigative of the RSPB,

00:07:04.760 --> 00:07:07.600
 who was specifically outcatch egg thieves,

00:07:07.600 --> 00:07:11.680
 and he raided this hotel in Salisbury in 1994.

00:07:11.680 --> 00:07:12.520
 And there was this,

00:07:12.520 --> 00:07:14.440
 'cause he knew that there was a short-down society

00:07:14.440 --> 00:07:15.640
 dinner taking place.

00:07:15.640 --> 00:07:19.480
 And the RSPB actually planted an attractive female employee

00:07:19.480 --> 00:07:21.560
 at the bar at the meeting of the egg thieves

00:07:21.560 --> 00:07:23.200
 to try and get secrets out of them.

00:07:23.200 --> 00:07:25.040
 Did they think they were gonna get laid?

00:07:25.040 --> 00:07:28.360
 (audience laughs)

00:07:28.360 --> 00:07:31.160
 - There's another thing, when you get a prison,

00:07:31.160 --> 00:07:32.200
 and people have been to prison,

00:07:32.200 --> 00:07:34.200
 it's illegal to collect bird eggs.

00:07:34.200 --> 00:07:35.760
 They get a hard time in prison,

00:07:35.760 --> 00:07:37.040
 according to one investigator,

00:07:37.040 --> 00:07:39.160
 'cause it just seems very weird as a crime.

00:07:39.160 --> 00:07:40.560
 (audience laughs)

00:07:40.560 --> 00:07:42.400
 And some of them will only speak on the radio

00:07:42.400 --> 00:07:44.960
 if their voices are disguised,

00:07:44.960 --> 00:07:46.520
 like they're a terrorist.

00:07:46.520 --> 00:07:48.000
 (audience laughs)

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:49.760
 - Oh, yeah, there's one who's called Mr. X,

00:07:49.760 --> 00:07:51.320
 who's a known egg for eggs.

00:07:51.320 --> 00:07:53.320
 (audience laughs)

00:07:53.320 --> 00:07:54.920
 Oh, that's what he's done.

00:07:54.920 --> 00:07:57.160
 (audience laughs)

00:07:57.160 --> 00:07:59.240
 Eggers and you two have the same sense of humour.

00:07:59.240 --> 00:08:00.240
 (audience laughs)

00:08:00.240 --> 00:08:02.480
 But he goes around wearing a crow mask all the time

00:08:02.480 --> 00:08:03.720
 to disguise his identity.

00:08:03.720 --> 00:08:06.960
 - He disguises himself by wearing a crow mask.

00:08:06.960 --> 00:08:09.880
 (audience laughs)

00:08:09.880 --> 00:08:11.960
 - He's climbing up trees, though, isn't he?

00:08:11.960 --> 00:08:14.360
 (audience laughs)

00:08:14.360 --> 00:08:16.040
 - I think both other crows and humans

00:08:16.040 --> 00:08:17.360
 would rumble him immediately.

00:08:17.360 --> 00:08:20.360
 (audience laughs)

00:08:20.360 --> 00:08:23.240
 Have you guys heard of the national egg collection?

00:08:23.240 --> 00:08:24.080
 - No. - This is cool.

00:08:24.080 --> 00:08:25.440
 This was the first world war thing.

00:08:25.440 --> 00:08:27.720
 Basically, there were lots of wounded soldiers and sailors,

00:08:27.720 --> 00:08:30.160
 and the country had to start a massive egg collecting drive

00:08:30.160 --> 00:08:32.480
 to send to the soldiers and sailors.

00:08:32.480 --> 00:08:35.760
 They collected a million a week, a million eggs a week,

00:08:35.760 --> 00:08:37.360
 and they sent them to the front,

00:08:37.360 --> 00:08:39.040
 which is very dangerous place for an egg.

00:08:39.040 --> 00:08:40.880
 (audience laughs)

00:08:40.880 --> 00:08:43.160
 People wrote their names and addresses on each egg

00:08:43.160 --> 00:08:44.640
 with a message for wounded people.

00:08:44.640 --> 00:08:47.200
 So if you were a soldier lying in hospital near the front,

00:08:47.200 --> 00:08:48.760
 you would get an egg to live with you with a message

00:08:48.760 --> 00:08:50.520
 saying, "Well done, and this is for me,

00:08:50.520 --> 00:08:51.640
 "and this is who I am."

00:08:51.640 --> 00:08:52.480
 - Oh, yeah.

00:08:52.480 --> 00:08:53.960
 - I don't think anyone got married off the back of eggs.

00:08:53.960 --> 00:08:55.600
 That would be very romantic, I think.

00:08:55.600 --> 00:08:56.600
 (audience laughs)

00:08:56.600 --> 00:08:57.920
 - A similar thing of writing on eggs.

00:08:57.920 --> 00:08:59.920
 Have you guys heard of clown eggs?

00:08:59.920 --> 00:09:02.640
 - If you're a clown, you have a unique pattern

00:09:02.640 --> 00:09:04.880
 of painting on your face,

00:09:04.880 --> 00:09:07.560
 and in order to trademark your face,

00:09:07.560 --> 00:09:09.360
 you need to paint it on an egg.

00:09:09.360 --> 00:09:11.800
 And you give that egg to this warehouse in East London.

00:09:11.800 --> 00:09:12.760
 There's a few more now,

00:09:12.760 --> 00:09:14.200
 but initially it was in East London,

00:09:14.200 --> 00:09:16.800
 and that would trademark your face officially as a thing.

00:09:16.800 --> 00:09:18.720
 And there's thousands and thousands of eggs.

00:09:18.720 --> 00:09:19.760
 It's an amazing tradition.

00:09:19.760 --> 00:09:22.520
 - What if you're a bald clown with no makeup?

00:09:22.520 --> 00:09:23.600
 - And no features.

00:09:23.600 --> 00:09:25.120
 (audience laughs)

00:09:25.120 --> 00:09:27.160
 Like that guy on Twitter.

00:09:27.160 --> 00:09:29.080
 (audience laughs)

00:09:29.080 --> 00:09:30.600
 He is a dickhead, isn't he?

00:09:30.600 --> 00:09:31.440
 (audience laughs)

00:09:31.440 --> 00:09:32.600
 He's so rude.

00:09:32.600 --> 00:09:34.080
 (audience laughs)

00:09:34.080 --> 00:09:37.240
 - Can I do some stuff about sticking things in your mouth?

00:09:37.240 --> 00:09:39.080
 (audience laughs)

00:09:39.080 --> 00:09:40.240
 - Yeah.

00:09:40.240 --> 00:09:41.240
 - Is it post curfew?

00:09:41.240 --> 00:09:42.520
 - Yeah, is it going.

00:09:42.520 --> 00:09:45.440
 - So there's a guy called Dinesh Upadhyaya,

00:09:45.440 --> 00:09:47.280
 who's a science teacher from India,

00:09:47.280 --> 00:09:50.640
 and he holds 48 world records for stuffing objects

00:09:50.640 --> 00:09:52.160
 into his mouth.

00:09:52.160 --> 00:09:53.000
 - Impressive.

00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:56.040
 - So he's put five golf balls in there.

00:09:56.040 --> 00:09:59.920
 He's 79 grapes, 92 pencils.

00:09:59.920 --> 00:10:01.400
 - Penisles.

00:10:01.400 --> 00:10:02.720
 - 92 pencils.

00:10:02.720 --> 00:10:03.720
 (audience laughs)

00:10:03.720 --> 00:10:05.480
 - He must have been heavily sharpened.

00:10:05.480 --> 00:10:07.120
 - Surely.

00:10:07.120 --> 00:10:09.760
 - You can't go one pencil in your mouth.

00:10:09.760 --> 00:10:11.720
 - Yeah, you don't tell James what he can't come to do,

00:10:11.720 --> 00:10:12.560
 I don't know.

00:10:12.560 --> 00:10:13.400
 - You put a pencil in there.

00:10:13.400 --> 00:10:15.040
 - Oh, not all the way in, just.

00:10:15.040 --> 00:10:16.320
 - Yeah, so they're kind of,

00:10:16.320 --> 00:10:17.800
 if you can imagine at home,

00:10:17.800 --> 00:10:19.080
 putting a pencil in your mouth,

00:10:19.080 --> 00:10:21.800
 but not sideways like the blood tensor.

00:10:21.800 --> 00:10:23.080
 - Like a smokin' a cigar.

00:10:23.080 --> 00:10:24.320
 - Yes, exactly like that.

00:10:24.320 --> 00:10:26.000
 So he does that 92 times.

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:27.000
 (audience laughs)

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:30.080
 He's done 12 lit candles in his mouth,

00:10:30.080 --> 00:10:31.800
 and he says that daily practice

00:10:31.800 --> 00:10:34.080
 was the key to his success.

00:10:34.080 --> 00:10:38.440
 And he says he aims to break all possible mouth-stuffing records

00:10:38.440 --> 00:10:39.720
 as soon as possible.

00:10:39.720 --> 00:10:41.800
 (audience laughs)

00:10:41.800 --> 00:10:42.840
 He says, "Great, doesn't he?"

00:10:42.840 --> 00:10:44.480
 - That's so great.

00:10:44.480 --> 00:10:46.520
 - I don't reckon he's gone much competition.

00:10:46.520 --> 00:10:47.360
 I think that's neat.

00:10:47.360 --> 00:10:49.400
 He could've just put two candles in his mouth.

00:10:49.400 --> 00:10:50.400
 No one else is doing it.

00:10:50.400 --> 00:10:52.480
 (audience laughs)

00:10:52.480 --> 00:10:55.160
 Also, if you're competing over putting lit candles

00:10:55.160 --> 00:10:56.000
 in your mouth,

00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:58.000
 you absolutely need to specify on that record

00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:00.120
 which way you've inserted it into your mouth.

00:11:00.120 --> 00:11:02.240
 'Cause if it's just lit and facing outwards,

00:11:02.240 --> 00:11:03.840
 that's not remotely impressive.

00:11:03.840 --> 00:11:04.680
 - Yeah, you're right.

00:11:04.680 --> 00:11:06.560
 - That's just you put a bit of wax in your mouth.

00:11:06.560 --> 00:11:09.000
 - Oh no, because it's, you know,

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:10.440
 the longer you take to put more in,

00:11:10.440 --> 00:11:13.160
 the closer the flame gets to your head.

00:11:13.160 --> 00:11:14.800
 - What do you mean it burns down?

00:11:14.800 --> 00:11:16.240
 - Yeah, it would burn towards your head.

00:11:16.240 --> 00:11:18.000
 - You'd have to be pretty slow putting them in.

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:19.000
 - You wouldn't, yeah.

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:19.840
 - I don't.

00:11:19.840 --> 00:11:23.680
 - It would be like a very, very slow James Bond villain-esque.

00:11:23.680 --> 00:11:24.920
 (audience laughs)

00:11:24.920 --> 00:11:26.760
 - Have you put them Mr. Bond?

00:11:26.760 --> 00:11:29.240
 (audience laughs)

00:11:29.240 --> 00:11:31.680
 - What budget Bond films have you wanted?

00:11:31.680 --> 00:11:35.280
 (audience laughs)

00:11:35.280 --> 00:11:36.120
 - The dumbest of Bond.

00:11:36.120 --> 00:11:38.000
 I expect you to age one year.

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:41.000
 (audience laughs)

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:45.580
 (upbeat music)

00:11:45.580 --> 00:11:52.920
 - Okay, it is time for fact number two, and that is James.

00:11:52.920 --> 00:11:56.000
 - Okay, my fact this week is that if a woman left her husband

00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:57.960
 in 18th century England,

00:11:57.960 --> 00:12:00.880
 the husband would often put a lost and found advert

00:12:00.880 --> 00:12:02.240
 in the local newspaper.

00:12:02.240 --> 00:12:03.760
 (audience laughs)

00:12:03.760 --> 00:12:05.280
 And this is the thing that happened.

00:12:05.280 --> 00:12:08.760
 And it's the thing that happened in the 1700s,

00:12:08.760 --> 00:12:11.480
 but it happened all the way to 1980.

00:12:11.480 --> 00:12:15.680
 But the golden age of it was in, I mean golden age, yeah.

00:12:15.680 --> 00:12:17.480
 What's the opposite of a golden age?

00:12:17.480 --> 00:12:18.560
 - Shitty age.

00:12:18.560 --> 00:12:19.560
 (audience laughs)

00:12:19.560 --> 00:12:22.040
 - The shitty age of it was the 1700s.

00:12:22.040 --> 00:12:25.560
 And there's a blog called georgineera.blogspot.com.

00:12:25.560 --> 00:12:27.840
 And they've collected a load of examples from history.

00:12:27.840 --> 00:12:30.640
 So they've got one from the leads intelligentsia

00:12:30.640 --> 00:12:34.720
 from 1797, one from the Chester Chronicle of 1799.

00:12:34.720 --> 00:12:37.080
 And basically for more than 300 years,

00:12:37.080 --> 00:12:40.080
 if your wife left you, you might put an advert

00:12:40.080 --> 00:12:42.240
 in the newspaper saying you basically

00:12:42.240 --> 00:12:44.800
 be no longer responsible for her debts.

00:12:44.800 --> 00:12:45.640
 - Yeah.

00:12:45.640 --> 00:12:46.480
 - Basically.

00:12:46.480 --> 00:12:47.480
 - Because husbands basically were responsible

00:12:47.480 --> 00:12:48.840
 for paying for their wives at all times, weren't they?

00:12:48.840 --> 00:12:50.880
 So if your wife screwed up like that,

00:12:50.880 --> 00:12:52.400
 then you were like, I'm not responsible for that.

00:12:52.400 --> 00:12:53.240
 - Yeah.

00:12:53.240 --> 00:12:56.200
 - The thing was, people did this thinking it was a legal thing

00:12:56.200 --> 00:12:57.040
 that would help them out.

00:12:57.040 --> 00:12:59.280
 Actually, it had no legal basis whatsoever.

00:12:59.280 --> 00:13:01.320
 Maybe in colonial times in America for a show

00:13:01.320 --> 00:13:02.720
 I'm out of time, it might have worked,

00:13:02.720 --> 00:13:04.880
 but certainly not in 1980, it wouldn't have worked.

00:13:04.880 --> 00:13:06.040
 (audience laughs)

00:13:06.040 --> 00:13:07.440
 And the phrasing was always the same.

00:13:07.440 --> 00:13:08.960
 It was, my wife is not here anymore.

00:13:08.960 --> 00:13:09.840
 She's left the house.

00:13:09.840 --> 00:13:12.520
 I will not pay for any of her debts.

00:13:12.520 --> 00:13:15.480
 It's a bit like, you know, you know on Twitter

00:13:15.480 --> 00:13:18.120
 where it says like retweets are not endorsements.

00:13:18.120 --> 00:13:19.760
 And everyone thinks that's a legal thing

00:13:19.760 --> 00:13:22.520
 that will save them if they do anything.

00:13:22.520 --> 00:13:23.960
 And it absolutely won't.

00:13:23.960 --> 00:13:24.800
 - Oh no.

00:13:24.800 --> 00:13:25.640
 - Well, this is exactly the same thing.

00:13:25.640 --> 00:13:26.480
 - What?

00:13:26.480 --> 00:13:27.480
 (audience laughs)

00:13:27.480 --> 00:13:29.960
 - I've been retweeting some pretty bad egg-based accounts.

00:13:29.960 --> 00:13:31.200
 (audience laughs)

00:13:31.200 --> 00:13:32.520
 And they did all have the same wording,

00:13:32.520 --> 00:13:34.320
 but some of them got pretty funky with the language.

00:13:34.320 --> 00:13:35.160
 Only a few.

00:13:35.160 --> 00:13:37.760
 So I found one from 1841, which said,

00:13:37.760 --> 00:13:39.960
 "Whereas Fanny Martin has, without calls,

00:13:39.960 --> 00:13:42.640
 "left my habitation and is floating on the ocean

00:13:42.640 --> 00:13:44.400
 "of tyrannical extravagance.

00:13:44.400 --> 00:13:45.960
 (audience laughs)

00:13:45.960 --> 00:13:49.480
 "Pro to prodigality, taking a wild goose chase

00:13:49.480 --> 00:13:52.920
 "and kindling her pipe with the call of curiosity."

00:13:52.920 --> 00:13:55.520
 (audience laughs)

00:13:55.520 --> 00:13:57.680
 (audience laughs)

00:13:57.680 --> 00:13:58.960
 - Amazing.

00:13:58.960 --> 00:14:01.000
 - That's a great tagline for our show, isn't it?

00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:02.200
 - Oh yeah.

00:14:02.200 --> 00:14:05.360
 - What was it kindling your pipe with the call of curiosity?

00:14:05.360 --> 00:14:06.680
 (audience laughs)

00:14:06.680 --> 00:14:09.120
 - But the women used to get understandably quite annoyed

00:14:09.120 --> 00:14:10.880
 'cause often they'd left their husbands

00:14:10.880 --> 00:14:13.120
 for totally justified reasons.

00:14:13.120 --> 00:14:15.400
 Even though in all of these ads, as James says,

00:14:15.400 --> 00:14:17.920
 they all the ad said, without just calls.

00:14:17.920 --> 00:14:21.360
 And so the women started coming back from the very early days

00:14:21.360 --> 00:14:23.920
 and posting their own ads in newspapers,

00:14:23.920 --> 00:14:25.680
 actually explaining why they'd done this.

00:14:25.680 --> 00:14:29.440
 So for instance, in 1810, there was a woman called Elizabeth Dick

00:14:29.440 --> 00:14:31.200
 and her husband had put this advert out saying,

00:14:31.200 --> 00:14:32.440
 "No, it's not a funny name.

00:14:32.440 --> 00:14:33.280
 "Come on."

00:14:33.280 --> 00:14:34.640
 (audience laughs)

00:14:34.640 --> 00:14:35.480
 - How are you Fanny?

00:14:35.480 --> 00:14:38.600
 - Her husband had said that she'd gone without just calls.

00:14:38.600 --> 00:14:40.200
 And so she posted an advert in the paper,

00:14:40.200 --> 00:14:41.600
 a couple of weeks later, saying,

00:14:41.600 --> 00:14:44.120
 "It is true that I left my husband's bed and board,

00:14:44.120 --> 00:14:47.040
 "but not before he made several attempts to murder me."

00:14:47.040 --> 00:14:49.880
 (audience laughs)

00:14:49.880 --> 00:14:50.960
 - It used to do weird things.

00:14:50.960 --> 00:14:52.520
 The my favorite thing that I read about this,

00:14:52.520 --> 00:14:54.280
 if there was a sort of marital dispute,

00:14:54.280 --> 00:14:57.400
 there used to be a thing which was marital jewels.

00:14:57.400 --> 00:14:58.720
 Have you heard of that?

00:14:58.720 --> 00:15:01.520
 So it's, you know, classic pistols at dawn,

00:15:01.520 --> 00:15:05.560
 except this was husband versus wife to sort out an argument.

00:15:05.560 --> 00:15:07.920
 And there were specific rules about the marital jewel

00:15:07.920 --> 00:15:09.280
 that you had to hear by.

00:15:09.280 --> 00:15:12.720
 So the basic rules were that you would go to the place,

00:15:12.720 --> 00:15:14.360
 there would be an adjudicator.

00:15:14.360 --> 00:15:17.200
 The wife was armed with three rocks

00:15:17.200 --> 00:15:19.440
 and that she could wrap them around in cloth

00:15:19.440 --> 00:15:22.000
 to swing and hit the husband with.

00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:24.200
 And this is in the 1200s.

00:15:24.200 --> 00:15:28.280
 The man basically had wooden clubs,

00:15:28.280 --> 00:15:30.640
 but he had to have a disadvantage to the fight.

00:15:30.640 --> 00:15:33.480
 So his disadvantage was he had to have one arm tied

00:15:33.480 --> 00:15:36.080
 behind his back and he had to fight the jewel

00:15:36.080 --> 00:15:38.400
 from within a three-foot hole in the ground.

00:15:38.400 --> 00:15:40.560
 (audience laughs)

00:15:40.560 --> 00:15:43.920
 So he would be sat whacking away

00:15:43.920 --> 00:15:46.760
 and she could stand, he could never leave the hole

00:15:46.760 --> 00:15:49.720
 and she could run around and smack him with her rocks.

00:15:49.720 --> 00:15:52.040
 And that was a real thing,

00:15:52.040 --> 00:15:56.320
 and there's countless accounts of the marital jewel happening.

00:15:56.320 --> 00:15:57.640
 We should bring that back.

00:15:57.640 --> 00:16:02.640
 - As a married man, I don't think we should bring that back.

00:16:02.640 --> 00:16:03.800
 - Yeah, why did I say that?

00:16:03.800 --> 00:16:05.280
 - We should certainly bring it back as a game.

00:16:05.280 --> 00:16:07.800
 I mean, that is a fun game, you're standing in a hole.

00:16:07.800 --> 00:16:10.520
 You've got, maybe let's make the club out of foam or something.

00:16:10.520 --> 00:16:12.560
 - That's like a channel five game show, isn't it?

00:16:12.560 --> 00:16:13.400
 - Yeah.

00:16:13.400 --> 00:16:18.200
 - I forgot to tell you guys, I had a marital argument this morning

00:16:18.200 --> 00:16:19.720
 but you forgot to tell us.

00:16:19.720 --> 00:16:20.720
 (audience laughs)

00:16:20.720 --> 00:16:22.120
 - It's something I didn't realize I did.

00:16:22.120 --> 00:16:23.840
 I woke up in the morning and I was like,

00:16:23.840 --> 00:16:24.680
 "You okay?"

00:16:24.680 --> 00:16:27.200
 And she said, "You slept all class night."

00:16:27.200 --> 00:16:28.640
 I was like, "Did I?"

00:16:28.640 --> 00:16:29.640
 What did I say?

00:16:29.640 --> 00:16:32.920
 She said, "You said, "I have many secrets."

00:16:32.920 --> 00:16:35.680
 (audience laughs)

00:16:35.680 --> 00:16:38.520
 And that was it.

00:16:38.520 --> 00:16:41.720
 She was up for the rest of the night.

00:16:41.720 --> 00:16:44.240
 I was like, "He's fucking secrets."

00:16:44.240 --> 00:16:45.400
 Done.

00:16:45.400 --> 00:16:46.720
 She knows about the egg stealing.

00:16:46.720 --> 00:16:48.960
 (audience laughs)

00:16:48.960 --> 00:16:52.480
 - So I was looking at classified adverts in the newspaper.

00:16:52.480 --> 00:16:54.280
 That's the thing that happens.

00:16:54.280 --> 00:16:57.400
 So classified adverts were an enormous thing.

00:16:57.400 --> 00:16:59.440
 You know, they kept loads of newspapers going

00:16:59.440 --> 00:17:00.640
 in the days before Craigslist

00:17:00.640 --> 00:17:02.600
 and whatever people use these days.

00:17:02.600 --> 00:17:06.080
 But the London Review of Books used to have

00:17:06.080 --> 00:17:09.080
 the greatest personal's adverts to find love

00:17:09.080 --> 00:17:10.440
 out of any publication.

00:17:10.440 --> 00:17:13.280
 And people used to collect these and read them avidly.

00:17:13.280 --> 00:17:15.960
 So they included things like,

00:17:15.960 --> 00:17:18.120
 these are all complete ones, by the way.

00:17:18.120 --> 00:17:20.000
 Angry troll up, 37.

00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:20.840
 Offers?

00:17:20.840 --> 00:17:23.840
 (audience laughs)

00:17:23.840 --> 00:17:26.840
 Amazing.

00:17:26.840 --> 00:17:27.920
 There was another one.

00:17:27.920 --> 00:17:30.920
 Less Venus in first, more Derek in Bucksdon.

00:17:30.920 --> 00:17:32.680
 (audience laughs)

00:17:32.680 --> 00:17:33.520
 Interested?

00:17:33.520 --> 00:17:34.520
 Right.

00:17:34.520 --> 00:17:36.080
 Right to Derek in Bucksdon.

00:17:36.080 --> 00:17:37.760
 (audience laughs)

00:17:37.760 --> 00:17:39.960
 And this is my favorite, favorite, favorite, favorite one.

00:17:39.960 --> 00:17:43.440
 Vegan love God on the brink of mental and physical collapse,

00:17:43.440 --> 00:17:47.520
 male 26, seeks pallid calcium deficient female

00:17:47.520 --> 00:17:49.640
 for nights of apathy, depression, and headaches

00:17:49.640 --> 00:17:51.360
 while touring the moral high ground.

00:17:51.360 --> 00:17:54.880
 (audience laughs)

00:17:54.880 --> 00:17:56.320
 - So you mentioned Craigslist.

00:17:56.320 --> 00:17:58.280
 They have some really funny postings that have gone up

00:17:58.280 --> 00:17:59.280
 and a lot of them are jokes.

00:17:59.280 --> 00:18:01.040
 But some of them, I was reading through, you know,

00:18:01.040 --> 00:18:03.680
 their best ones they've had.

00:18:03.680 --> 00:18:06.240
 And some of them I think are real and incredibly sad.

00:18:06.240 --> 00:18:08.960
 So this was one posting on Craigslist a few years ago.

00:18:08.960 --> 00:18:11.480
 I need someone to hide Easter eggs in my apartment

00:18:11.480 --> 00:18:12.720
 when I'm not there.

00:18:12.720 --> 00:18:14.440
 They are small and filled with candy.

00:18:14.440 --> 00:18:16.360
 I would like to find them myself on Sunday.

00:18:16.360 --> 00:18:19.480
 I am willing to pay serious enquiries only.

00:18:19.480 --> 00:18:21.080
 You want someone to, I know.

00:18:21.080 --> 00:18:22.840
 - I mean, it sounds like someone weaning them

00:18:22.840 --> 00:18:24.360
 self off ex stealing, doesn't it?

00:18:24.360 --> 00:18:25.200
 (audience laughs)

00:18:25.200 --> 00:18:27.600
 Please, please, please ignore the rumful

00:18:27.600 --> 00:18:29.720
 of 10,000 eggs with mismatched labels.

00:18:29.720 --> 00:18:31.200
 (audience laughs)

00:18:31.200 --> 00:18:33.080
 And the man dressed as a crow in a car.

00:18:33.080 --> 00:18:35.640
 (audience laughs)

00:18:35.640 --> 00:18:36.640
 - There was another one.

00:18:36.640 --> 00:18:39.360
 There was one about a man who claimed

00:18:39.360 --> 00:18:41.280
 that he'd robbed a woman's purse.

00:18:41.280 --> 00:18:43.640
 But then he'd caught her eye after he was robbing it.

00:18:43.640 --> 00:18:44.680
 So he'd mugged a woman.

00:18:44.680 --> 00:18:46.400
 He'd then he'd put an ad on Craigslist saying,

00:18:46.400 --> 00:18:48.320
 "Hi, I mugged you the other day."

00:18:48.320 --> 00:18:50.000
 But then I caught your eye.

00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:51.840
 There was a quick moment when our eyes met

00:18:51.840 --> 00:18:53.400
 and I felt something strong.

00:18:53.400 --> 00:18:54.880
 I think you felt it too.

00:18:54.880 --> 00:18:55.880
 (audience laughs)

00:18:55.880 --> 00:18:59.240
 If I wasn't so shy, brackets also committing a crime.

00:18:59.240 --> 00:19:00.760
 Close brackets.

00:19:00.760 --> 00:19:02.400
 I would have asked your name.

00:19:02.400 --> 00:19:03.840
 I, of course, later got your name

00:19:03.840 --> 00:19:05.200
 from your driver's license.

00:19:05.200 --> 00:19:08.160
 (audience laughs)

00:19:08.160 --> 00:19:11.240
 So Jennifer, if you'd like to get together for a drink,

00:19:11.240 --> 00:19:12.400
 please call me.

00:19:12.400 --> 00:19:14.200
 - I'm made. - I'm outside your front door.

00:19:14.200 --> 00:19:15.680
 (audience laughs)

00:19:15.680 --> 00:19:16.720
 Do you know that Guns and Roses

00:19:16.720 --> 00:19:18.400
 got together through a personal's advert?

00:19:18.400 --> 00:19:19.520
 - Did they? - Yeah.

00:19:19.520 --> 00:19:21.600
 So there was, this used to be a thing

00:19:21.600 --> 00:19:22.680
 for bands getting together.

00:19:22.680 --> 00:19:24.400
 So they were posted in music magazines

00:19:24.400 --> 00:19:25.640
 and obviously which have a music you like,

00:19:25.640 --> 00:19:27.040
 you posted in that magazine.

00:19:27.040 --> 00:19:28.920
 So the advert said, "Base player needed

00:19:28.920 --> 00:19:31.600
 "for band influenced by Aerosmith, Alice Cooper."

00:19:31.600 --> 00:19:32.880
 - Call slash.

00:19:32.880 --> 00:19:34.000
 - Oh, what? - Call slash.

00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:34.840
 - Call slash.

00:19:34.840 --> 00:19:37.160
 - And they used to put the holes in the enemy,

00:19:37.160 --> 00:19:38.000
 didn't they quite a lot?

00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:39.080
 I remember when I was growing up

00:19:39.080 --> 00:19:40.520
 and of course that's closed down today.

00:19:40.520 --> 00:19:41.680
 - Just today. - Yeah.

00:19:41.680 --> 00:19:42.520
 - What?

00:19:42.520 --> 00:19:43.920
 - Last issue goes out on Friday.

00:19:43.920 --> 00:19:44.760
 - You joking.

00:19:44.760 --> 00:19:45.600
 - No jokes.

00:19:45.600 --> 00:19:47.200
 - Last chance if you want to get in a band, Andy.

00:19:47.200 --> 00:19:48.800
 (audience laughs)

00:19:48.800 --> 00:19:49.840
 - I thought I was in one.

00:19:49.840 --> 00:19:50.680
 (audience laughs)

00:19:50.680 --> 00:19:52.400
 So it was a weird sort of vocal band.

00:19:52.400 --> 00:19:54.640
 (audience laughs)

00:19:54.640 --> 00:19:56.400
 - I think there's a problem in classifieds, right?

00:19:56.400 --> 00:19:57.880
 When people are looking into the history of them

00:19:57.880 --> 00:20:00.040
 'cause you don't get any other extra information.

00:20:00.040 --> 00:20:02.520
 So there's this really good looking book,

00:20:02.520 --> 00:20:04.880
 which is called "Found Strange Red Cow."

00:20:04.880 --> 00:20:08.800
 And it's called that because it's related to an advert

00:20:08.800 --> 00:20:11.960
 that was placed in the Pennsylvania Gazette in the 19th century

00:20:11.960 --> 00:20:14.120
 which said, "Found Strange Red Cow."

00:20:14.120 --> 00:20:15.480
 And it was about a cow that wandered

00:20:15.480 --> 00:20:16.440
 onto someone's property

00:20:16.440 --> 00:20:19.120
 and will return to owner who proves that they own it.

00:20:19.120 --> 00:20:22.280
 But another example of one of the ads in this book

00:20:22.280 --> 00:20:24.640
 is 1892 in New York.

00:20:24.640 --> 00:20:27.800
 Wanted a young lady of German parentage

00:20:27.800 --> 00:20:30.240
 must be 36 inch bust

00:20:30.240 --> 00:20:32.960
 and understand bookkeeping on a small scale.

00:20:32.960 --> 00:20:33.960
 (audience laughs)

00:20:33.960 --> 00:20:36.040
 - What job requires?

00:20:36.040 --> 00:20:37.600
 All of those very specific issues.

00:20:37.600 --> 00:20:38.800
 - But I'm willing to compromise

00:20:38.800 --> 00:20:40.920
 on the bookkeeping on a small scale.

00:20:40.920 --> 00:20:43.760
 (audience laughs)

00:20:43.760 --> 00:20:46.000
 - Okay, move on to fact number three.

00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:47.240
 And that is my fact.

00:20:47.240 --> 00:20:50.080
 My fact this week is that there is a bell

00:20:50.080 --> 00:20:55.080
 that's been ringing in Oxford nonstop for 178 years.

00:20:55.080 --> 00:20:57.720
 Yeah.

00:20:57.720 --> 00:20:59.480
 - Yeah, you guys must be pissed off about that.

00:20:59.480 --> 00:21:00.320
 - Yeah.

00:21:00.320 --> 00:21:01.160
 - Sounds really annoying.

00:21:01.160 --> 00:21:02.840
 - The hometown fact or where we're recording

00:21:02.840 --> 00:21:03.800
 or home city fact.

00:21:03.800 --> 00:21:06.600
 It's, this is in the Clarendon Laboratory.

00:21:06.600 --> 00:21:09.040
 It's a 10 minute walk from where we are right now.

00:21:09.040 --> 00:21:11.440
 And back in 1840, they set this up

00:21:11.440 --> 00:21:14.720
 with a new experimental battery that they wanted to test out.

00:21:14.720 --> 00:21:16.280
 And effectively, it's two batteries

00:21:16.280 --> 00:21:18.920
 and a little bell hanging between

00:21:18.920 --> 00:21:21.400
 and it oscillates and just goes between the two bells.

00:21:21.400 --> 00:21:23.240
 And they thought it would last for a while.

00:21:23.240 --> 00:21:25.640
 But since 1840, it has not stopped.

00:21:25.640 --> 00:21:26.480
 It is still going.

00:21:26.480 --> 00:21:27.560
 I visited it today.

00:21:27.560 --> 00:21:28.400
 You can go and see it.

00:21:28.400 --> 00:21:29.240
 - Oh, did you?

00:21:29.240 --> 00:21:31.120
 - And you look really close and it's just tingling, tingling.

00:21:31.120 --> 00:21:32.720
 - It's just tiny here at Dinging.

00:21:32.720 --> 00:21:33.880
 - No, I made the noise.

00:21:33.880 --> 00:21:38.120
 It's behind two bits of very thick glass

00:21:38.120 --> 00:21:39.840
 and then it's in a thicker, a bit of glass

00:21:39.840 --> 00:21:41.120
 even so once you get to it.

00:21:41.120 --> 00:21:42.440
 - I don't know it's Dinging then.

00:21:42.440 --> 00:21:43.480
 - 'Cause I made the noise.

00:21:43.480 --> 00:21:47.840
 - We don't know what noise it's making if any,

00:21:47.840 --> 00:21:49.160
 but you can see it physically.

00:21:49.160 --> 00:21:50.640
 - Well, it's likely to be a Dinging.

00:21:50.640 --> 00:21:51.560
 - It's one of those things when you see it.

00:21:51.560 --> 00:21:52.600
 You're like, tingling, tingling.

00:21:52.600 --> 00:21:55.120
 It's got the motion of that.

00:21:55.120 --> 00:21:57.440
 And yeah, so this has been going

00:21:57.440 --> 00:21:58.360
 and it's battery powered.

00:21:58.360 --> 00:21:59.520
 This is what's most impressive.

00:21:59.520 --> 00:22:02.440
 It's not as if it's a perpetual motion or anything.

00:22:02.440 --> 00:22:04.200
 Which would actually be more impressive.

00:22:04.200 --> 00:22:05.040
 - Yeah.

00:22:05.040 --> 00:22:09.640
 - Given how that would break the laws of the universe.

00:22:09.640 --> 00:22:13.960
 - No, I don't want to show this over the science first.

00:22:13.960 --> 00:22:16.000
 It's another perpetual motion thing I've built.

00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:19.280
 - The problem is is that because they don't know

00:22:19.280 --> 00:22:21.720
 the exact composer of what's going inside it,

00:22:21.720 --> 00:22:23.640
 they need to just leave it

00:22:23.640 --> 00:22:26.280
 because the experiment now is how long will this go for.

00:22:26.280 --> 00:22:27.720
 It's like Schroddinger's battery.

00:22:27.720 --> 00:22:31.520
 If you touch it and go in, you ruin the experiment.

00:22:31.520 --> 00:22:33.520
 So yeah, so they're just going to wait it out.

00:22:33.520 --> 00:22:34.680
 It's a long-term experiment.

00:22:34.680 --> 00:22:37.240
 - The best guess is that it's 2,000 alternate layers

00:22:37.240 --> 00:22:40.720
 of metal foil and paper coated with manganese dioxide

00:22:40.720 --> 00:22:43.200
 and honey compressed into a glass tube

00:22:43.200 --> 00:22:46.200
 and sealed from humidity in a casing of sulphur.

00:22:46.200 --> 00:22:47.040
 - Honey!

00:22:47.040 --> 00:22:47.880
 - That is, honey.

00:22:47.880 --> 00:22:49.200
 - That's a good guess, isn't it?

00:22:49.200 --> 00:22:51.920
 (all laughing)

00:22:51.920 --> 00:22:54.680
 - You were close, but it was peanut butter.

00:22:54.680 --> 00:22:57.200
 (all laughing)

00:22:57.200 --> 00:22:59.920
 I just find it amazing that this stuff doesn't erode,

00:22:59.920 --> 00:23:04.240
 which I know metals are very erosion proof,

00:23:04.240 --> 00:23:09.240
 but the clapper has struck the bell 10,911,456,000 times

00:23:09.240 --> 00:23:12.960
 since it started.

00:23:12.960 --> 00:23:15.640
 That's like almost 11 billion times.

00:23:15.640 --> 00:23:18.440
 - Yeah, they think that the physical bell will break

00:23:18.440 --> 00:23:20.320
 before the battery itself breaks.

00:23:20.320 --> 00:23:22.280
 'Cause there's a lot of metallic dust at the bottom,

00:23:22.280 --> 00:23:25.040
 isn't there, where it's kind of eroded over time?

00:23:25.040 --> 00:23:25.880
 - Yeah.

00:23:25.880 --> 00:23:27.920
 - But you know what, this experiment is called

00:23:27.920 --> 00:23:30.040
 the Oxford Dry Pile experiment

00:23:30.040 --> 00:23:32.600
 and it's been going longer than physics.

00:23:32.600 --> 00:23:35.400
 (all laughing)

00:23:35.400 --> 00:23:38.200
 By which I mean that it was bought in 1840,

00:23:38.200 --> 00:23:40.760
 like you say, by Reverend Robert Walker

00:23:40.760 --> 00:23:43.600
 and he was a reader in experimental philosophy

00:23:43.600 --> 00:23:45.760
 and that's what they called physics back then.

00:23:45.760 --> 00:23:47.760
 So it's before you had physics professors.

00:23:47.760 --> 00:23:48.600
 - Yeah, wow.

00:23:48.600 --> 00:23:49.440
 - That's cool, isn't it?

00:23:49.440 --> 00:23:50.280
 - That is cool.

00:23:50.280 --> 00:23:52.960
 - Also, the battery was effectively made in 1825.

00:23:52.960 --> 00:23:56.280
 They started ringing it as a bell in 1840,

00:23:56.280 --> 00:23:59.160
 but Walter, with the first batteries, was 1800.

00:23:59.160 --> 00:24:02.200
 So in 25 years, they created a battery

00:24:02.200 --> 00:24:05.600
 that is still running today and just nailed it.

00:24:05.600 --> 00:24:07.200
 - I imagine when it stops, they'll be like,

00:24:07.200 --> 00:24:08.400
 have you tried rubbing it?

00:24:08.400 --> 00:24:11.160
 (all laughing)

00:24:11.160 --> 00:24:12.000
 - I think we should say,

00:24:12.000 --> 00:24:13.120
 'cause I think there's been a few moments

00:24:13.120 --> 00:24:17.000
 where it has stopped due to humidity and stuff like that,

00:24:17.000 --> 00:24:18.400
 but it's always come back on.

00:24:18.400 --> 00:24:20.520
 - Does anyone else have a problem with dry pile being

00:24:20.520 --> 00:24:22.040
 a way for this incredible?

00:24:22.040 --> 00:24:23.520
 - Terrible problem with dry piles.

00:24:23.520 --> 00:24:24.960
 (all laughing)

00:24:24.960 --> 00:24:28.200
 My notes are all about completely different stuff, actually.

00:24:28.200 --> 00:24:30.120
 It's mostly a list of pharmacists

00:24:30.120 --> 00:24:31.680
 that I've visited today.

00:24:31.680 --> 00:24:33.840
 (all laughing)

00:24:33.840 --> 00:24:35.080
 - It's an unfortunate name

00:24:35.080 --> 00:24:37.720
 who was an extremely important piece of, you know,

00:24:37.720 --> 00:24:40.440
 physical progress, but the Voltaic pile

00:24:40.440 --> 00:24:45.440
 invented by Volta of voltage fame is what it's basically based on.

00:24:45.440 --> 00:24:48.080
 And I didn't actually realize how they worked,

00:24:48.080 --> 00:24:51.360
 but basically it's just the Voltaic pile

00:24:51.360 --> 00:24:54.400
 is alternating layers of two different types of metal.

00:24:54.400 --> 00:24:58.920
 And if you've got metals of two different chemical components,

00:24:58.920 --> 00:25:00.760
 then charge will travel between them.

00:25:00.760 --> 00:25:03.480
 If you put like salty watery paper between them,

00:25:03.480 --> 00:25:05.320
 so that allows electricity to conduct,

00:25:05.320 --> 00:25:07.200
 'cause you've got this watery salty paper.

00:25:07.200 --> 00:25:10.680
 So the metal slightly dissolves into that paper.

00:25:10.680 --> 00:25:12.080
 And then when they touch each other,

00:25:12.080 --> 00:25:14.680
 then the current travels through them

00:25:14.680 --> 00:25:16.120
 and a circuit is created.

00:25:16.120 --> 00:25:18.560
 So it's just a pile of metal with a wet paper in between.

00:25:18.560 --> 00:25:19.400
 - It was bizarre.

00:25:19.400 --> 00:25:20.400
 - That's electricity.

00:25:20.400 --> 00:25:23.640
 - And he's the guy who demonstrated electricity

00:25:23.640 --> 00:25:26.840
 first by electrocuting loads of frogs, right?

00:25:26.840 --> 00:25:28.280
 Volta, so he--

00:25:28.280 --> 00:25:29.640
 - And Galvani as well.

00:25:29.640 --> 00:25:33.160
 - And Galvani, so these were the two electricity pioneers

00:25:33.160 --> 00:25:34.520
 of the early 19th century.

00:25:34.520 --> 00:25:36.120
 And they were kind of for this fight,

00:25:36.120 --> 00:25:39.280
 because Volta used to put two different types of metal

00:25:39.280 --> 00:25:40.880
 on a dead frog's leg.

00:25:40.880 --> 00:25:42.360
 And the frog's leg would twitch.

00:25:42.360 --> 00:25:44.480
 And he'd say, look, that shows that these two different metals

00:25:44.480 --> 00:25:45.600
 are creating electricity.

00:25:45.600 --> 00:25:48.960
 And Galvani, from where we get the word Galvanise,

00:25:48.960 --> 00:25:51.680
 said, no, no, it's because the frog's leg

00:25:51.680 --> 00:25:53.640
 is generating electricity.

00:25:53.640 --> 00:25:56.040
 And he thought that dead animal, you know,

00:25:56.040 --> 00:25:58.280
 bit created electricity.

00:25:58.280 --> 00:25:59.400
 So he turns out he was wrong.

00:25:59.400 --> 00:26:01.680
 - But we could have had a world where instead of a battery,

00:26:01.680 --> 00:26:03.440
 you have to shove a dead frog's leg

00:26:03.440 --> 00:26:05.120
 into the back of your torch.

00:26:05.120 --> 00:26:06.120
 - A better world.

00:26:06.120 --> 00:26:07.200
 - A better world.

00:26:07.200 --> 00:26:08.200
 (laughing)

00:26:08.200 --> 00:26:09.640
 - Do you know Volta did an experiment

00:26:09.640 --> 00:26:11.880
 just after he invented the Voltaic pile

00:26:11.880 --> 00:26:14.960
 where he found out that electricity takes sour.

00:26:14.960 --> 00:26:17.240
 And the way that he did this was he got a number of volunteers

00:26:17.240 --> 00:26:18.600
 to form a chain.

00:26:18.600 --> 00:26:21.040
 And they each pinched the tongue of the person,

00:26:21.040 --> 00:26:22.640
 I won't do it Andy, don't worry.

00:26:22.640 --> 00:26:24.080
 Of the person next to them.

00:26:24.080 --> 00:26:26.880
 And so they were all in a chain pinching each other's tongue.

00:26:26.880 --> 00:26:29.840
 And then he put some electricity going through them.

00:26:29.840 --> 00:26:31.680
 And everyone could taste the fingers

00:26:31.680 --> 00:26:34.320
 of the person next to them going sour.

00:26:34.320 --> 00:26:35.160
 - Really?

00:26:35.160 --> 00:26:36.320
 - That's a good experiment.

00:26:36.320 --> 00:26:38.440
 - But how do you get the volunteers for that

00:26:38.440 --> 00:26:39.680
 in your class of mind ever?

00:26:39.680 --> 00:26:42.720
 Wanted, what are the volunteers for wacky stuff?

00:26:42.720 --> 00:26:43.560
 (laughing)

00:26:43.560 --> 00:26:44.640
 Actually, we don't have electricity.

00:26:44.640 --> 00:26:46.640
 And he'd say, come and taste my fingers.

00:26:46.640 --> 00:26:48.800
 (laughing)

00:26:48.800 --> 00:26:50.440
 Taste my finger was the Victorian equivalent

00:26:50.440 --> 00:26:51.640
 of pull my finger actually.

00:26:51.640 --> 00:26:53.200
 (laughing)

00:26:53.200 --> 00:26:55.480
 - Do you know, just on how batteries work

00:26:55.480 --> 00:26:58.320
 and how, you know, electrical current flows.

00:26:58.320 --> 00:27:00.880
 In the 19th century, there were a lot of cases

00:27:00.880 --> 00:27:02.840
 of exploding teeth.

00:27:02.840 --> 00:27:05.480
 And I know it sounds like those two sentences are unrelated.

00:27:05.480 --> 00:27:08.040
 But they've realized, people have realized

00:27:08.040 --> 00:27:09.680
 that the most likely explanation for this

00:27:09.680 --> 00:27:11.080
 is that people used to have teeth

00:27:11.080 --> 00:27:12.680
 that were made of metal, obviously.

00:27:12.680 --> 00:27:14.960
 And they would often be two different types of metal.

00:27:14.960 --> 00:27:16.920
 And there were all these dentist records

00:27:16.920 --> 00:27:18.680
 and doctors records of exploding teeth.

00:27:18.680 --> 00:27:21.040
 Like, people would be in huge amounts of pain.

00:27:21.040 --> 00:27:22.800
 And they'd feel like there was an electric current

00:27:22.800 --> 00:27:23.920
 going into their gums.

00:27:23.920 --> 00:27:25.480
 And then their teeth would explode.

00:27:25.480 --> 00:27:27.200
 And it's actually because they literally

00:27:27.200 --> 00:27:29.280
 were turning their mouths into a battery.

00:27:29.280 --> 00:27:30.960
 So if you had these two different types of metal

00:27:30.960 --> 00:27:32.280
 and they were making contact,

00:27:32.280 --> 00:27:34.400
 then there was a circuit running around your mouth.

00:27:34.400 --> 00:27:37.160
 - Well, and that's what happens if you have a filling

00:27:37.160 --> 00:27:38.280
 and you bite a bit of metal,

00:27:38.280 --> 00:27:39.760
 you're making a tiny little battery there,

00:27:39.760 --> 00:27:40.600
 aren't you? - Yeah.

00:27:40.600 --> 00:27:41.320
 - That's why that's so painful.

00:27:41.320 --> 00:27:42.160
 - Really?

00:27:42.160 --> 00:27:43.000
 - Yeah.

00:27:43.000 --> 00:27:43.840
 - Is that painful?

00:27:43.840 --> 00:27:44.680
 - Yeah.

00:27:44.680 --> 00:27:47.240
 (laughing)

00:27:47.240 --> 00:27:48.720
 - I was looking a bit into,

00:27:48.720 --> 00:27:50.240
 'cause this is a long-term experiment

00:27:50.240 --> 00:27:51.720
 that's been going on.

00:27:51.720 --> 00:27:53.320
 I just looked into long-term experiments.

00:27:53.320 --> 00:27:56.160
 And I found one which I thought was really interesting.

00:27:56.160 --> 00:27:59.040
 There was a paper that was published in 1998

00:27:59.040 --> 00:28:00.360
 and the title of it was,

00:28:00.360 --> 00:28:03.840
 "Does knuckle cracking lead to arthritis of the fingers?"

00:28:03.840 --> 00:28:08.160
 And this was written by a scientist called Donald Unger,

00:28:08.160 --> 00:28:12.080
 who basically for 60 years cracked his knuckles

00:28:12.080 --> 00:28:14.320
 in order to work out if it was arthritis

00:28:14.320 --> 00:28:15.720
 that you would get off the back of it.

00:28:15.720 --> 00:28:17.320
 He did it because when he was a kid,

00:28:17.320 --> 00:28:19.120
 his mother and his aunties said to him,

00:28:19.120 --> 00:28:21.360
 "Stop cracking your knuckles, you're gonna get arthritis."

00:28:21.360 --> 00:28:22.400
 And he thought, "No, I'm not."

00:28:22.400 --> 00:28:25.320
 So he said, "60 years on the left hand alone,

00:28:25.320 --> 00:28:26.920
 cracking his knuckles."

00:28:26.920 --> 00:28:28.480
 And then he didn't crack his right hand.

00:28:28.480 --> 00:28:29.320
 - Exactly.

00:28:29.320 --> 00:28:30.600
 So it started as a kid.

00:28:30.600 --> 00:28:33.080
 Just was like every day he would crack his knuckles

00:28:33.080 --> 00:28:34.600
 and he got to the end and his answer was,

00:28:34.600 --> 00:28:36.120
 "No, it doesn't give you arthritis."

00:28:36.120 --> 00:28:38.160
 - Although, that seems like a very petty thing

00:28:38.160 --> 00:28:40.800
 to spite your mother for 60 years.

00:28:40.800 --> 00:28:41.960
 - Yeah.

00:28:41.960 --> 00:28:43.440
 - It was an unhealthy relationship.

00:28:43.440 --> 00:28:44.280
 - Okay.

00:28:44.280 --> 00:28:45.800
 I have done further papers and it turns out

00:28:45.800 --> 00:28:47.440
 the broccoli is not delicious.

00:28:47.440 --> 00:28:50.440
 (audience laughing)

00:28:50.440 --> 00:28:55.480
 And it turns out, I won't go blind if I keep doing that.

00:28:55.480 --> 00:28:59.160
 (audience laughing)

00:28:59.160 --> 00:29:00.520
 - Should we move on to our final fact?

00:29:00.520 --> 00:29:01.360
 - Yeah.

00:29:01.360 --> 00:29:03.680
 - Okay, it is our final fact of the show

00:29:03.680 --> 00:29:05.440
 and that is Andy.

00:29:05.440 --> 00:29:07.280
 - My fact is that King Edward VII

00:29:07.280 --> 00:29:10.440
 had a liquor invented specifically for him to drink

00:29:10.440 --> 00:29:11.640
 while driving.

00:29:11.640 --> 00:29:14.800
 (audience laughing)

00:29:14.800 --> 00:29:17.800
 This was very pretty health and safety.

00:29:17.800 --> 00:29:19.960
 So there's a drink, it's called the King's Ginger

00:29:19.960 --> 00:29:21.920
 'cause it was named for him.

00:29:21.920 --> 00:29:24.560
 He was the first monarch to drive a car.

00:29:24.560 --> 00:29:26.040
 He was driving from about 1898.

00:29:26.040 --> 00:29:27.280
 He was an early adopter.

00:29:27.280 --> 00:29:28.840
 He became King in 1901.

00:29:28.840 --> 00:29:31.400
 And he was a huge fan of drinking,

00:29:31.400 --> 00:29:34.120
 but he was driving around on quite chilly mores,

00:29:34.120 --> 00:29:35.320
 open top cars.

00:29:35.320 --> 00:29:38.000
 And his doctor, this is the story of the drink,

00:29:38.000 --> 00:29:40.400
 was worried that he might get cold and chilly.

00:29:40.400 --> 00:29:43.520
 So instead of giving him medical advice,

00:29:43.520 --> 00:29:47.400
 he just asked a wine merchant to invent a new alcohol for him.

00:29:47.400 --> 00:29:49.920
 And it's very gingery and it's called King's Ginger.

00:29:49.920 --> 00:29:50.800
 - And it still exists, right?

00:29:50.800 --> 00:29:51.640
 - It still exists.

00:29:51.640 --> 00:29:54.200
 And actually, I've brought some along with me tonight.

00:29:54.200 --> 00:29:55.040
 - That's so good.

00:29:55.040 --> 00:29:57.000
 - My wine was literally about to run out.

00:29:57.000 --> 00:29:58.480
 - Well, have you got a cup?

00:29:58.480 --> 00:29:59.960
 - I've got four.

00:29:59.960 --> 00:30:01.920
 I did try and find shot glasses in my house,

00:30:01.920 --> 00:30:04.880
 but due to my lifestyle, I've got one.

00:30:04.880 --> 00:30:08.000
 (audience laughing)

00:30:08.000 --> 00:30:12.400
 I've then got two measuring shot glasses,

00:30:12.400 --> 00:30:14.760
 which he used for K&Pepa.

00:30:14.760 --> 00:30:15.840
 (audience laughing)

00:30:15.840 --> 00:30:18.320
 And I've got one shot glass I borrowed from the venue.

00:30:18.320 --> 00:30:19.280
 Thank you very much.

00:30:19.280 --> 00:30:20.720
 (audience laughing)

00:30:20.720 --> 00:30:23.400
 So if you'd like to, oh, Cracky.

00:30:23.400 --> 00:30:24.720
 - I'm not driving home later.

00:30:24.720 --> 00:30:25.960
 Am I still allowed to drink it?

00:30:25.960 --> 00:30:27.800
 (audience laughing)

00:30:27.800 --> 00:30:30.600
 - We don't normally finish with alcohol consumption on stage.

00:30:30.600 --> 00:30:32.600
 Sorry, we normally start with it, but.

00:30:32.600 --> 00:30:34.320
 (audience laughing)

00:30:34.320 --> 00:30:36.320
 And it's shot at it, right.

00:30:36.320 --> 00:30:37.480
 - It was a shot glass.

00:30:37.480 --> 00:30:40.480
 (audience laughing)

00:30:40.480 --> 00:30:43.480
 (audience cheering)

00:30:43.480 --> 00:30:47.120
 - Okay, should we talk about facts and stuff?

00:30:47.120 --> 00:30:48.120
 - Yeah, sure.

00:30:48.120 --> 00:30:50.200
 - Oh yeah, ever the seventh.

00:30:50.200 --> 00:30:53.080
 He liked drinking, he liked generally having a good time,

00:30:53.080 --> 00:30:54.400
 didn't he, ever the seventh?

00:30:54.400 --> 00:30:57.880
 So old Bertie, one of the things he was famous for

00:30:57.880 --> 00:31:02.320
 was having a siège d'amour or a loft chair,

00:31:02.320 --> 00:31:05.720
 which is an item which I think still exists today,

00:31:05.720 --> 00:31:08.000
 but it was made for his own personal use,

00:31:08.000 --> 00:31:10.320
 a brothel called Lushabane,

00:31:10.320 --> 00:31:12.440
 which was a very famous brothel in Paris.

00:31:12.440 --> 00:31:14.800
 And if you should look it up, the loft chair,

00:31:14.800 --> 00:31:16.600
 if ever the seventh, and apparently it's made for him

00:31:16.600 --> 00:31:18.920
 to have sex with two women at the same time.

00:31:18.920 --> 00:31:21.720
 It's a bizarre contraption, it's got stirrups on it,

00:31:21.720 --> 00:31:23.200
 it's got hand grips on it.

00:31:23.200 --> 00:31:25.280
 I've steered it for about 45 minutes today,

00:31:25.280 --> 00:31:26.840
 and I cannot for the life of me work out

00:31:26.840 --> 00:31:28.760
 how you could have sex with one person.

00:31:28.760 --> 00:31:31.440
 - Let alone two, using this chair.

00:31:31.440 --> 00:31:32.440
 - But he was worried, wasn't he,

00:31:32.440 --> 00:31:35.320
 because he got quite massive later in life,

00:31:35.320 --> 00:31:37.560
 and so his main worry was he didn't,

00:31:37.560 --> 00:31:39.760
 he was having a lot of sex still with a lot of people,

00:31:39.760 --> 00:31:42.200
 and he didn't want to crush them while he was having sex.

00:31:42.200 --> 00:31:43.600
 That was his decision.

00:31:43.600 --> 00:31:48.000
 So the chair gave him the sort of the uncrushability

00:31:48.000 --> 00:31:51.520
 that he was looking for when having a minasie toire.

00:31:51.520 --> 00:31:53.720
 - Yeah. - And can I just say quickly,

00:31:53.720 --> 00:31:55.320
 because I know we're in England,

00:31:55.320 --> 00:31:57.720
 and everyone knows who Edward the seventh is,

00:31:57.720 --> 00:32:00.280
 but as you know, there's little else spoken about

00:32:00.280 --> 00:32:03.320
 these days, contemporary national discourse.

00:32:03.320 --> 00:32:07.680
 But for international listeners, he was the son of Queen Victoria.

00:32:07.680 --> 00:32:11.600
 He was born in 1841, which, for context of this podcast,

00:32:11.600 --> 00:32:14.400
 was one year after the bell started ringing in Oxford.

00:32:14.400 --> 00:32:16.160
 (audience laughs)

00:32:16.160 --> 00:32:18.800
 And he was, yeah, he was known as Dirty Bertie.

00:32:18.800 --> 00:32:22.560
 He was such a odd character, but very influential as well.

00:32:22.560 --> 00:32:24.400
 A lot of things have gone through history

00:32:24.400 --> 00:32:27.000
 that are said to be, as a result of him,

00:32:27.000 --> 00:32:30.200
 one we know for sure is the fact that the royals get two birthdays.

00:32:30.200 --> 00:32:31.600
 The Queen has two birthdays.

00:32:31.600 --> 00:32:32.920
 That's down to him.

00:32:32.920 --> 00:32:34.600
 Because his birthday was at a bad time.

00:32:34.600 --> 00:32:35.600
 It was in a wintery time.

00:32:35.600 --> 00:32:37.920
 So he said, "I want a more a summary one."

00:32:37.920 --> 00:32:39.840
 So he gave himself a second birthday.

00:32:39.840 --> 00:32:41.880
 So that's down to him.

00:32:41.880 --> 00:32:43.120
 Some royal drinks.

00:32:43.120 --> 00:32:44.000
 - Oh, yeah. - All right.

00:32:44.000 --> 00:32:47.000
 - So you said Queen Victoria, who was his mother?

00:32:47.000 --> 00:32:49.760
 - Yes. - Her favorite drink was whiskey

00:32:49.760 --> 00:32:52.200
 and red wine mixed together.

00:32:52.200 --> 00:32:53.040
 - Yeah, that's true.

00:32:53.040 --> 00:32:54.520
 I think we found out from Gladstone,

00:32:54.520 --> 00:32:56.880
 didn't we, a Prime Minister of the 19th century?

00:32:56.880 --> 00:32:59.360
 And yeah, he did not like the idea.

00:32:59.360 --> 00:33:03.120
 He wrote, "She has her claret strengthened,

00:33:03.120 --> 00:33:06.160
 "and I should have thought spoiled with whiskey,

00:33:06.160 --> 00:33:07.960
 "but that was her drink."

00:33:07.960 --> 00:33:10.640
 Kate Middleton likes crack, baby.

00:33:10.640 --> 00:33:14.000
 - Sorry. - Hey, never called me baby again.

00:33:14.000 --> 00:33:16.640
 (laughing)

00:33:16.640 --> 00:33:19.400
 That was a very legally contentious statement, James.

00:33:19.400 --> 00:33:20.560
 It's a cocktail.

00:33:20.560 --> 00:33:21.400
 There's no crack in it.

00:33:21.400 --> 00:33:23.560
 It's called vodka, raspberry liqueur,

00:33:23.560 --> 00:33:25.280
 passion fruit and champagne.

00:33:25.280 --> 00:33:27.040
 It's called crack, baby.

00:33:27.040 --> 00:33:28.200
 That's one of her favorite drinks.

00:33:28.200 --> 00:33:30.000
 Did you know that there is a new drink

00:33:30.000 --> 00:33:31.720
 that's been invented called a Voktail?

00:33:31.720 --> 00:33:32.920
 This is from last year.

00:33:32.920 --> 00:33:34.440
 It's by the University of Singapore

00:33:34.440 --> 00:33:36.240
 and it's a virtual cocktail.

00:33:36.240 --> 00:33:38.000
 So it's a special glass,

00:33:38.000 --> 00:33:39.600
 which can make you think you're drinking alcohol,

00:33:39.600 --> 00:33:41.240
 even though you're not.

00:33:41.240 --> 00:33:43.320
 - Sounds awful. - It's got three methods.

00:33:43.320 --> 00:33:45.680
 So you pour a liquid in, you pour just normal water in

00:33:45.680 --> 00:33:48.440
 and then there's a light that goes on in the glass.

00:33:48.440 --> 00:33:50.600
 So already you think, "Oh, it's a lovely red cocktail,"

00:33:50.600 --> 00:33:54.200
 whatever, then there are electrodes all around the rim

00:33:54.200 --> 00:33:55.880
 where you can alter the sweetness

00:33:55.880 --> 00:33:57.240
 or the saltiness or the bitterness

00:33:57.240 --> 00:33:59.440
 by stimulating the tongue with a small electric current,

00:33:59.440 --> 00:34:00.200
 like--

00:34:00.200 --> 00:34:02.040
 - Valter. - Yeah, man, vulter.

00:34:02.040 --> 00:34:03.920
 And finally, there's a tube in the side

00:34:03.920 --> 00:34:05.680
 which releases gases to make you think

00:34:05.680 --> 00:34:06.840
 that you're drinking something else.

00:34:06.840 --> 00:34:08.400
 So you can think you're drinking lemonade

00:34:08.400 --> 00:34:09.600
 even though you're drinking water.

00:34:09.600 --> 00:34:11.000
 And then do they smack you over the head

00:34:11.000 --> 00:34:12.280
 so you have a headache in the morning?

00:34:12.280 --> 00:34:14.280
 (laughing)

00:34:14.280 --> 00:34:18.680
 Hey, we're gonna have to wrap up shortly.

00:34:18.680 --> 00:34:21.160
 Do you guys have anything before we do?

00:34:21.160 --> 00:34:22.200
 I've had so much kings to enjoy.

00:34:22.200 --> 00:34:23.560
 I can't really see any more, though.

00:34:23.560 --> 00:34:25.560
 (laughing)

00:34:26.560 --> 00:34:29.600
 I got one last thing which I really like,

00:34:29.600 --> 00:34:32.200
 which is that there's a lot of celebrity alcohols

00:34:32.200 --> 00:34:33.560
 that have been released over the years.

00:34:33.560 --> 00:34:37.760
 And my favorite, like ACDC, do wine, iron maiden, do beer,

00:34:37.760 --> 00:34:41.120
 Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie and Danny DeVito,

00:34:41.120 --> 00:34:42.800
 they all have their different wines.

00:34:42.800 --> 00:34:44.840
 My favorite one is that the band Hanson,

00:34:44.840 --> 00:34:46.680
 famous for the song "Umbop,"

00:34:46.680 --> 00:34:50.000
 they released their own beer, which they called "Umbops."

00:34:50.000 --> 00:34:53.880
 And that's available at shops.

00:34:53.880 --> 00:34:55.800
 It shops, I think you'll find it.

00:34:55.800 --> 00:34:58.120
 (laughing)

00:34:58.120 --> 00:34:59.280
 Okay, that is it.

00:34:59.280 --> 00:35:00.360
 That is all of our facts.

00:35:00.360 --> 00:35:01.760

 We've got links to our tour.

00:35:22.320 --> 00:35:23.520
 We have links to our book.

00:35:23.520 --> 00:35:26.560
 We have links to this, well, very soon, hopefully,

00:35:26.560 --> 00:35:29.320
 our cassette, when we're about to give one away.

00:35:29.320 --> 00:35:30.880
 Because we ask the audience here in Oxford

00:35:30.880 --> 00:35:32.600
 to give us a fact.

00:35:32.600 --> 00:35:34.400
 Their favorite fact, James is picked a winner.

00:35:34.400 --> 00:35:38.080
 So the winner is, it is Ryan O'Reilly.

00:35:38.080 --> 00:35:42.800
 The fact is that in 2005, Babu, a male red panda,

00:35:42.800 --> 00:35:46.440
 a Birmingham nature center in Birmingham, escaped.

00:35:46.440 --> 00:35:49.720
 He was subsequently named Brummy of the Year.

00:35:49.720 --> 00:35:52.040
 (laughing)

00:35:53.400 --> 00:35:54.400
 Amazing.

00:35:54.400 --> 00:35:55.800
 What for escaping Birmingham?

00:35:55.800 --> 00:35:58.800
 (laughing)

00:35:58.800 --> 00:36:01.480
 Ryan come find us outside at the end of the show.

00:36:01.480 --> 00:36:02.680
 We'll give you a cassette.

00:36:02.680 --> 00:36:05.120
 And this is, we're not selling them anywhere else.

00:36:05.120 --> 00:36:06.880
 So if anyone wants one, they're going to be out in the foyer.

00:36:06.880 --> 00:36:08.520
 We're going to be out there as well, signing them.

00:36:08.520 --> 00:36:10.000
 Guys, thank you so much for being here.

00:36:10.000 --> 00:36:12.040
 We'll be back again next week with another episode.

00:36:12.040 --> 00:36:12.880
 Goodbye.

00:36:12.880 --> 00:36:15.880
 (audience cheering)

00:36:15.880 --> 00:36:18.460
 (upbeat music)

00:36:19.300 --> 00:36:22.300
 (audience cheering)

00:36:22.300 --> 00:36:25.300
 (audience cheering)
