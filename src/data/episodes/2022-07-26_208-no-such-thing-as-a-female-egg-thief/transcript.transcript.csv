00:00:08,00:00:10,(upbeat music)
00:00:10,00:00:13,- Hello and welcome to another episode
00:00:13,00:00:16,of No Such Thing as a Fish.
00:00:16,00:00:19,(audience cheering)
00:00:19,00:00:22,(speaking in foreign language)
00:00:22,00:00:24,from Oxford.
00:00:24,00:00:28,(audience cheering)
00:00:28,00:00:29,My name is Dan Schreiber.
00:00:29,00:00:31,"Here I am sitting here with Anna Chazinski,"
00:00:31,00:00:33,"Andrew Hunter Murray, and James Harkin."
00:00:33,00:00:35,"And once again, we have gathered around the microphones"
00:00:35,00:00:38,with our four favorite facts from the last seven days
00:00:38,00:00:40,"and in no particular order, here we go."
00:00:40,00:00:42,"Starting with you, Anna."
00:00:42,00:00:44,"- My fact this week is that the Victorian soldier,"
00:00:44,00:00:48,"Major Charles Bendire, once braved enemy fire"
00:00:48,00:00:50,"to get an egg from a tree,"
00:00:50,00:00:52,then held it in his mouth while he climbed down.
00:00:52,00:00:55,"And on finding that it was stuck inside his mouth,"
00:00:55,00:00:57,removed one of his teeth to free it.
00:00:57,00:01:00,(audience laughing)
00:01:00,00:01:01,It's amazing.
00:01:01,00:01:04,"- This is just egg collecting or egging, in fact,"
00:01:04,00:01:07,was a really popular pursuit in the 19th century.
00:01:07,00:01:09,And still some people do it today.
00:01:09,00:01:10,"And yeah, he was an egger."
00:01:10,00:01:13,And it was thought of as quite a manly pursuit.
00:01:13,00:01:17,It was very dangerous because like birds lay their eggs
00:01:17,00:01:19,in precarious positions on cliff faces
00:01:19,00:01:20,or really high up trees and stuff.
00:01:20,00:01:23,"So yeah, Major Charles Bendire got up there"
00:01:23,00:01:26,"to prove his manhood and yeah, had to have his tooth removed."
00:01:26,00:01:28,"And he was being attacked by a patchies, wasn't he?"
00:01:28,00:01:29,- Yes.
00:01:29,00:01:30,- This was an America.
00:01:30,00:01:34,He was trying to get an egg of a zone-tailed hawk.
00:01:34,00:01:36,And I looked to see how big those eggs are.
00:01:36,00:01:39,And they are about three inches by two inches.
00:01:39,00:01:41,"Okay, so if you can imagine that."
00:01:41,00:01:43,"What, I've got my phone here."
00:01:43,00:01:46,"The width of my phone, this is an iPhone 6s plus."
00:01:46,00:01:52,This is about the same width as the egg.
00:01:52,00:01:53,So I'm gonna put it in my mouth.
00:01:53,00:01:54,Okay.
00:01:56,00:01:57,- Wow.
00:01:57,00:01:58,- Wow.
00:01:58,00:01:59,- Listen to this at home.
00:01:59,00:02:00,This is incredible stuff.
00:02:00,00:02:03,"This is, I mean, the people of Oxford"
00:02:03,00:02:05,have never seen anyone deep-throw tonight before.
00:02:05,00:02:09,(audience laughing)
00:02:09,00:02:10,- Nobody has.
00:02:10,00:02:14,- Please no one text me right now.
00:02:14,00:02:16,(audience laughing)
00:02:16,00:02:18,"But anyway, that gives you an idea of how big the egg was."
00:02:18,00:02:21,- That's the width of it.
00:02:21,00:02:23,"- Yes, so that's the length actually"
00:02:23,00:02:24,and the width is two inches.
00:02:24,00:02:26,"So it's a bit smaller, widthwise."
00:02:26,00:02:27,It's egg-shaped.
00:02:27,00:02:28,"- Wait, is it okay?"
00:02:28,00:02:31,(audience laughing)
00:02:31,00:02:34,- You therefore put it in kind of with the long end.
00:02:34,00:02:35,- Yeah.
00:02:35,00:02:36,- You put it in the wrong way round.
00:02:36,00:02:39,"- I know, but I'm terrible, Ega."
00:02:39,00:02:40,But my feeling is that Charles Bendier
00:02:40,00:02:41,"might have done it that way, right?"
00:02:41,00:02:44,Because surely that's how it must have gotten stuck.
00:02:44,00:02:44,- Maybe.
00:02:44,00:02:47,"- Well, I think also his jaw swallled up, swelled up."
00:02:47,00:02:50,"Due to being under fire, it was a very tense situation."
00:02:50,00:02:51,And I think that made his jaw swell up a bit.
00:02:51,00:02:52,Meaning that--
00:02:52,00:02:53,- Is that what happens?
00:02:53,00:02:55,"- That's one account I read, and he had to get,"
00:02:55,00:02:58,so his men took it out under threat of court martial.
00:02:58,00:03:00,"He said, ""I will court martial you if you don't..."""
00:03:00,00:03:01,- How he went?
00:03:01,00:03:04,(audience laughing)
00:03:04,00:03:05,- Yeah.
00:03:05,00:03:06,"- And his tooth broke, didn't he?"
00:03:06,00:03:08,So it may not have been an entire tooth
00:03:08,00:03:11,and his tooth broke as it was on the way out
00:03:11,00:03:12,or he insisted that it was broken
00:03:12,00:03:14,to ensure that he retained the egg.
00:03:14,00:03:16,"- So, but burgers, no, sorry, Ega's,"
00:03:16,00:03:19,who had dangerous times.
00:03:19,00:03:21,There was another guy called Francis J. Britwell.
00:03:21,00:03:23,I'm pretty sure this is 19th century.
00:03:23,00:03:26,"He was strangled by his own climbing rope,"
00:03:26,00:03:28,climbing to reach a nest in a tall pine tree
00:03:28,00:03:30,on his honeymoon.
00:03:30,00:03:31,(laughing)
00:03:31,00:03:33,"- Oh, yeah, that's a good honeymoon."
00:03:33,00:03:35,"- The other thing is that guy, I Googled him"
00:03:35,00:03:37,to see if there was anything else about him.
00:03:37,00:03:39,And that seems to be literally the only thing
00:03:39,00:03:41,we know about him.
00:03:41,00:03:43,"- Imagine that, that's all you're known for,"
00:03:43,00:03:44,trying to get an egg on your honeymoon.
00:03:44,00:03:45,(laughing)
00:03:45,00:03:47,"- He died doing what he loved,"
00:03:47,00:03:49,"but not doing who he loved,"
00:03:49,00:03:50,which is what honeymoon's all about.
00:03:50,00:03:53,(laughing)
00:03:53,00:03:54,- Miss the entire point.
00:03:54,00:03:57,"- Yeah, but they get really obsessive, don't they,"
00:03:57,00:03:58,these collectors?
00:03:58,00:03:59,"- Yeah, and they still happen."
00:03:59,00:04:01,"So, there's a society called the Jordan,"
00:04:01,00:04:03,"Jordan, or Jordan Society,"
00:04:03,00:04:05,which is named after an egg collector of the 19th century.
00:04:05,00:04:08,"And this sort of still exists,"
00:04:08,00:04:09,"although they're honorary members now,"
00:04:09,00:04:12,because it's actually illegal to take eggs out of bird's nest
00:04:12,00:04:16,because it kind of damages birds' procreation cycles.
00:04:16,00:04:18,"But yeah, there are loads of them around."
00:04:18,00:04:23,"So, there's actually one of the UK's most prolific egg collectors"
00:04:23,00:04:26,"called Colin Watson, who I think had more eggs than anyone else"
00:04:26,00:04:28,"in the late '90s, and then they all got seized by the police."
00:04:28,00:04:32,But he died falling out of a tree in 2006.
00:04:32,00:04:33,"- Oh, yeah."
00:04:33,00:04:34,"- So again, still very risky."
00:04:34,00:04:37,"- And he's supposedly been retired for years, right?"
00:04:37,00:04:38,- Yeah.
00:04:38,00:04:39,"- Because he kept getting arrested,"
00:04:39,00:04:41,"so he said, ""I'm no longer in the game."""
00:04:41,00:04:46,"And then, but he was on a watch list of 300 egg collectors."
00:04:47,00:04:50,"So, there's a list where they come,"
00:04:50,00:04:52,and they think you have it.
00:04:52,00:04:53,They raid your house.
00:04:53,00:04:56,"- Oh, no, there was one guy who had 3,600 eggs in his house."
00:04:56,00:05:00,"And when the RSPB smashed his door in with the police,"
00:05:00,00:05:02,"he said to them, ""Thank God you've come."
00:05:02,00:05:03,"I can't stop."""
00:05:03,00:05:06,"So, this is a real obsession that people have."
00:05:06,00:05:06,"- Yeah, that's right."
00:05:06,00:05:09,"And often it's the wives or the family who call the police,"
00:05:09,00:05:11,"don't they, or call the RSPB?"
00:05:11,00:05:12,"Because they're worried about their husbands,"
00:05:12,00:05:14,and they always is husbands.
00:05:14,00:05:21,Literally every single person on this list is a male age between 25 and 45.
00:05:21,00:05:24,"No woman has ever been convicted of eggs, eh?"
00:05:24,00:05:25,"- Oh, I guess."
00:05:25,00:05:27,- They're just better at it.
00:05:27,00:05:28,- Thank you.
00:05:28,00:05:31,- I do it all the time.
00:05:31,00:05:33,No one's ever caught me.
00:05:33,00:05:36,"- There was a guy called Mervin Shorthouse in the '70s,"
00:05:36,00:05:38,"and so there's an egg collection at Trink,"
00:05:38,00:05:41,"which Walter Rothschild collected, thousands,"
00:05:41,00:05:43,maybe I think hundreds of thousands of eggs.
00:05:43,00:05:48,"But he broke in, and he posed as a wheelchair-bound invalid,"
00:05:48,00:05:53,"and he stole, over the course of three years, 10,000 eggs, 10,000."
00:05:53,00:05:56,"I think that's about 10 a day for three years, every day,"
00:05:56,00:05:59,including Christmas and your birthday.
00:05:59,00:06:02,And then he mixed up all the labels to apparently cover the theft.
00:06:02,00:06:03,"I'm not sure how that covers the theft,"
00:06:03,00:06:05,"because you've been probably 10,000 eggs in your house."
00:06:05,00:06:07,"- I've heard that with any museum thefts,"
00:06:07,00:06:12,"and any general theft where there's a label involved,"
00:06:12,00:06:15,the biggest problem that any scientist cares about
00:06:15,00:06:16,"is they don't care if a thing is stolen,"
00:06:16,00:06:19,because most likely it will be recovered down the line.
00:06:19,00:06:21,A black market trade will reveal it somewhere
00:06:21,00:06:22,somewhere in a house.
00:06:22,00:06:24,"It's when you remove the data that says what it was,"
00:06:24,00:06:26,"where it was, and how it was found."
00:06:26,00:06:28,"That's the most important thing that goes missing,"
00:06:28,00:06:29,the little label.
00:06:29,00:06:30,"- Yeah, yeah."
00:06:30,00:06:32,"- So we're saying steal what you like, but keep labels."
00:06:32,00:06:32,- Leave the labels.
00:06:32,00:06:33,- Yeah.
00:06:33,00:06:36,"- steal the labels up, even worse."
00:06:36,00:06:37,- Yeah.
00:06:37,00:06:38,- So strong.
00:06:38,00:06:41,- It must have going into a museum where nothing was labeled.
00:06:41,00:06:42,"You were just looking at stuff going,"
00:06:42,00:06:43,"""What the fuck is that?"""
00:06:43,00:06:45,(audience laughs)
00:06:45,00:06:45,No idea.
00:06:45,00:06:46,Is it angel Egyptian?
00:06:46,00:06:48,Is it 1920s?
00:06:48,00:06:50,"There was, it isn't quite gangster."
00:06:50,00:06:51,"There's this amazing New Yorker article,"
00:06:51,00:06:53,"which I would really recommend,"
00:06:53,00:06:55,which kind of goes through the long history
00:06:55,00:06:57,of egging kind of in the modern day.
00:06:57,00:07:01,"And one of the things it describes is a raid in 1994,"
00:07:01,00:07:03,"and this was by the RSPB,"
00:07:03,00:07:04,"the investigative of the RSPB,"
00:07:04,00:07:07,"who was specifically outcatch egg thieves,"
00:07:07,00:07:11,and he raided this hotel in Salisbury in 1994.
00:07:11,00:07:12,"And there was this,"
00:07:12,00:07:14,'cause he knew that there was a short-down society
00:07:14,00:07:15,dinner taking place.
00:07:15,00:07:19,And the RSPB actually planted an attractive female employee
00:07:19,00:07:21,at the bar at the meeting of the egg thieves
00:07:21,00:07:23,to try and get secrets out of them.
00:07:23,00:07:25,Did they think they were gonna get laid?
00:07:25,00:07:28,(audience laughs)
00:07:28,00:07:31,"- There's another thing, when you get a prison,"
00:07:31,00:07:32,"and people have been to prison,"
00:07:32,00:07:34,it's illegal to collect bird eggs.
00:07:34,00:07:35,"They get a hard time in prison,"
00:07:35,00:07:37,"according to one investigator,"
00:07:37,00:07:39,'cause it just seems very weird as a crime.
00:07:39,00:07:40,(audience laughs)
00:07:40,00:07:42,And some of them will only speak on the radio
00:07:42,00:07:44,"if their voices are disguised,"
00:07:44,00:07:46,like they're a terrorist.
00:07:46,00:07:48,(audience laughs)
00:07:48,00:07:49,"- Oh, yeah, there's one who's called Mr. X,"
00:07:49,00:07:51,who's a known egg for eggs.
00:07:51,00:07:53,(audience laughs)
00:07:53,00:07:54,"Oh, that's what he's done."
00:07:54,00:07:57,(audience laughs)
00:07:57,00:07:59,Eggers and you two have the same sense of humour.
00:07:59,00:08:00,(audience laughs)
00:08:00,00:08:02,But he goes around wearing a crow mask all the time
00:08:02,00:08:03,to disguise his identity.
00:08:03,00:08:06,- He disguises himself by wearing a crow mask.
00:08:06,00:08:09,(audience laughs)
00:08:09,00:08:11,"- He's climbing up trees, though, isn't he?"
00:08:11,00:08:14,(audience laughs)
00:08:14,00:08:16,- I think both other crows and humans
00:08:16,00:08:17,would rumble him immediately.
00:08:17,00:08:20,(audience laughs)
00:08:20,00:08:23,Have you guys heard of the national egg collection?
00:08:23,00:08:24,- No. - This is cool.
00:08:24,00:08:25,This was the first world war thing.
00:08:25,00:08:27,"Basically, there were lots of wounded soldiers and sailors,"
00:08:27,00:08:30,and the country had to start a massive egg collecting drive
00:08:30,00:08:32,to send to the soldiers and sailors.
00:08:32,00:08:35,"They collected a million a week, a million eggs a week,"
00:08:35,00:08:37,"and they sent them to the front,"
00:08:37,00:08:39,which is very dangerous place for an egg.
00:08:39,00:08:40,(audience laughs)
00:08:40,00:08:43,People wrote their names and addresses on each egg
00:08:43,00:08:44,with a message for wounded people.
00:08:44,00:08:47,"So if you were a soldier lying in hospital near the front,"
00:08:47,00:08:48,you would get an egg to live with you with a message
00:08:48,00:08:50,"saying, ""Well done, and this is for me,"
00:08:50,00:08:51,"""and this is who I am."""
00:08:51,00:08:52,"- Oh, yeah."
00:08:52,00:08:53,- I don't think anyone got married off the back of eggs.
00:08:53,00:08:55,"That would be very romantic, I think."
00:08:55,00:08:56,(audience laughs)
00:08:56,00:08:57,- A similar thing of writing on eggs.
00:08:57,00:08:59,Have you guys heard of clown eggs?
00:08:59,00:09:02,"- If you're a clown, you have a unique pattern"
00:09:02,00:09:04,"of painting on your face,"
00:09:04,00:09:07,"and in order to trademark your face,"
00:09:07,00:09:09,you need to paint it on an egg.
00:09:09,00:09:11,And you give that egg to this warehouse in East London.
00:09:11,00:09:12,"There's a few more now,"
00:09:12,00:09:14,"but initially it was in East London,"
00:09:14,00:09:16,and that would trademark your face officially as a thing.
00:09:16,00:09:18,And there's thousands and thousands of eggs.
00:09:18,00:09:19,It's an amazing tradition.
00:09:19,00:09:22,- What if you're a bald clown with no makeup?
00:09:22,00:09:23,- And no features.
00:09:23,00:09:25,(audience laughs)
00:09:25,00:09:27,Like that guy on Twitter.
00:09:27,00:09:29,(audience laughs)
00:09:29,00:09:30,"He is a dickhead, isn't he?"
00:09:30,00:09:31,(audience laughs)
00:09:31,00:09:32,He's so rude.
00:09:32,00:09:34,(audience laughs)
00:09:34,00:09:37,- Can I do some stuff about sticking things in your mouth?
00:09:37,00:09:39,(audience laughs)
00:09:39,00:09:40,- Yeah.
00:09:40,00:09:41,- Is it post curfew?
00:09:41,00:09:42,"- Yeah, is it going."
00:09:42,00:09:45,"- So there's a guy called Dinesh Upadhyaya,"
00:09:45,00:09:47,"who's a science teacher from India,"
00:09:47,00:09:50,and he holds 48 world records for stuffing objects
00:09:50,00:09:52,into his mouth.
00:09:52,00:09:53,- Impressive.
00:09:53,00:09:56,- So he's put five golf balls in there.
00:09:56,00:09:59,"He's 79 grapes, 92 pencils."
00:09:59,00:10:01,- Penisles.
00:10:01,00:10:02,- 92 pencils.
00:10:02,00:10:03,(audience laughs)
00:10:03,00:10:05,- He must have been heavily sharpened.
00:10:05,00:10:07,- Surely.
00:10:07,00:10:09,- You can't go one pencil in your mouth.
00:10:09,00:10:11,"- Yeah, you don't tell James what he can't come to do,"
00:10:11,00:10:12,I don't know.
00:10:12,00:10:13,- You put a pencil in there.
00:10:13,00:10:15,"- Oh, not all the way in, just."
00:10:15,00:10:16,"- Yeah, so they're kind of,"
00:10:16,00:10:17,"if you can imagine at home,"
00:10:17,00:10:19,"putting a pencil in your mouth,"
00:10:19,00:10:21,but not sideways like the blood tensor.
00:10:21,00:10:23,- Like a smokin' a cigar.
00:10:23,00:10:24,"- Yes, exactly like that."
00:10:24,00:10:26,So he does that 92 times.
00:10:26,00:10:27,(audience laughs)
00:10:27,00:10:30,"He's done 12 lit candles in his mouth,"
00:10:30,00:10:31,and he says that daily practice
00:10:31,00:10:34,was the key to his success.
00:10:34,00:10:38,And he says he aims to break all possible mouth-stuffing records
00:10:38,00:10:39,as soon as possible.
00:10:39,00:10:41,(audience laughs)
00:10:41,00:10:42,"He says, ""Great, doesn't he?"""
00:10:42,00:10:44,- That's so great.
00:10:44,00:10:46,- I don't reckon he's gone much competition.
00:10:46,00:10:47,I think that's neat.
00:10:47,00:10:49,He could've just put two candles in his mouth.
00:10:49,00:10:50,No one else is doing it.
00:10:50,00:10:52,(audience laughs)
00:10:52,00:10:55,"Also, if you're competing over putting lit candles"
00:10:55,00:10:56,"in your mouth,"
00:10:56,00:10:58,you absolutely need to specify on that record
00:10:58,00:11:00,which way you've inserted it into your mouth.
00:11:00,00:11:02,"'Cause if it's just lit and facing outwards,"
00:11:02,00:11:03,that's not remotely impressive.
00:11:03,00:11:04,"- Yeah, you're right."
00:11:04,00:11:06,- That's just you put a bit of wax in your mouth.
00:11:06,00:11:09,"- Oh no, because it's, you know,"
00:11:09,00:11:10,"the longer you take to put more in,"
00:11:10,00:11:13,the closer the flame gets to your head.
00:11:13,00:11:14,- What do you mean it burns down?
00:11:14,00:11:16,"- Yeah, it would burn towards your head."
00:11:16,00:11:18,- You'd have to be pretty slow putting them in.
00:11:18,00:11:19,"- You wouldn't, yeah."
00:11:19,00:11:19,- I don't.
00:11:19,00:11:23,"- It would be like a very, very slow James Bond villain-esque."
00:11:23,00:11:24,(audience laughs)
00:11:24,00:11:26,- Have you put them Mr. Bond?
00:11:26,00:11:29,(audience laughs)
00:11:29,00:11:31,- What budget Bond films have you wanted?
00:11:31,00:11:35,(audience laughs)
00:11:35,00:11:36,- The dumbest of Bond.
00:11:36,00:11:38,I expect you to age one year.
00:11:38,00:11:41,(audience laughs)
00:11:41,00:11:45,(upbeat music)
00:11:45,00:11:52,"- Okay, it is time for fact number two, and that is James."
00:11:52,00:11:56,"- Okay, my fact this week is that if a woman left her husband"
00:11:56,00:11:57,"in 18th century England,"
00:11:57,00:12:00,the husband would often put a lost and found advert
00:12:00,00:12:02,in the local newspaper.
00:12:02,00:12:03,(audience laughs)
00:12:03,00:12:05,And this is the thing that happened.
00:12:05,00:12:08,"And it's the thing that happened in the 1700s,"
00:12:08,00:12:11,but it happened all the way to 1980.
00:12:11,00:12:15,"But the golden age of it was in, I mean golden age, yeah."
00:12:15,00:12:17,What's the opposite of a golden age?
00:12:17,00:12:18,- Shitty age.
00:12:18,00:12:19,(audience laughs)
00:12:19,00:12:22,- The shitty age of it was the 1700s.
00:12:22,00:12:25,And there's a blog called georgineera.blogspot.com.
00:12:25,00:12:27,And they've collected a load of examples from history.
00:12:27,00:12:30,So they've got one from the leads intelligentsia
00:12:30,00:12:34,"from 1797, one from the Chester Chronicle of 1799."
00:12:34,00:12:37,"And basically for more than 300 years,"
00:12:37,00:12:40,"if your wife left you, you might put an advert"
00:12:40,00:12:42,in the newspaper saying you basically
00:12:42,00:12:44,be no longer responsible for her debts.
00:12:44,00:12:45,- Yeah.
00:12:45,00:12:46,- Basically.
00:12:46,00:12:47,- Because husbands basically were responsible
00:12:47,00:12:48,"for paying for their wives at all times, weren't they?"
00:12:48,00:12:50,"So if your wife screwed up like that,"
00:12:50,00:12:52,"then you were like, I'm not responsible for that."
00:12:52,00:12:53,- Yeah.
00:12:53,00:12:56,"- The thing was, people did this thinking it was a legal thing"
00:12:56,00:12:57,that would help them out.
00:12:57,00:12:59,"Actually, it had no legal basis whatsoever."
00:12:59,00:13:01,Maybe in colonial times in America for a show
00:13:01,00:13:02,"I'm out of time, it might have worked,"
00:13:02,00:13:04,"but certainly not in 1980, it wouldn't have worked."
00:13:04,00:13:06,(audience laughs)
00:13:06,00:13:07,And the phrasing was always the same.
00:13:07,00:13:08,"It was, my wife is not here anymore."
00:13:08,00:13:09,She's left the house.
00:13:09,00:13:12,I will not pay for any of her debts.
00:13:12,00:13:15,"It's a bit like, you know, you know on Twitter"
00:13:15,00:13:18,where it says like retweets are not endorsements.
00:13:18,00:13:19,And everyone thinks that's a legal thing
00:13:19,00:13:22,that will save them if they do anything.
00:13:22,00:13:23,And it absolutely won't.
00:13:23,00:13:24,- Oh no.
00:13:24,00:13:25,"- Well, this is exactly the same thing."
00:13:25,00:13:26,- What?
00:13:26,00:13:27,(audience laughs)
00:13:27,00:13:29,- I've been retweeting some pretty bad egg-based accounts.
00:13:29,00:13:31,(audience laughs)
00:13:31,00:13:32,"And they did all have the same wording,"
00:13:32,00:13:34,but some of them got pretty funky with the language.
00:13:34,00:13:35,Only a few.
00:13:35,00:13:37,"So I found one from 1841, which said,"
00:13:37,00:13:39,"""Whereas Fanny Martin has, without calls,"
00:13:39,00:13:42,"""left my habitation and is floating on the ocean"
00:13:42,00:13:44,"""of tyrannical extravagance."
00:13:44,00:13:45,(audience laughs)
00:13:45,00:13:49,"""Pro to prodigality, taking a wild goose chase"
00:13:49,00:13:52,"""and kindling her pipe with the call of curiosity."""
00:13:52,00:13:55,(audience laughs)
00:13:55,00:13:57,(audience laughs)
00:13:57,00:13:58,- Amazing.
00:13:58,00:14:01,"- That's a great tagline for our show, isn't it?"
00:14:01,00:14:02,- Oh yeah.
00:14:02,00:14:05,- What was it kindling your pipe with the call of curiosity?
00:14:05,00:14:06,(audience laughs)
00:14:06,00:14:09,- But the women used to get understandably quite annoyed
00:14:09,00:14:10,'cause often they'd left their husbands
00:14:10,00:14:13,for totally justified reasons.
00:14:13,00:14:15,"Even though in all of these ads, as James says,"
00:14:15,00:14:17,"they all the ad said, without just calls."
00:14:17,00:14:21,And so the women started coming back from the very early days
00:14:21,00:14:23,"and posting their own ads in newspapers,"
00:14:23,00:14:25,actually explaining why they'd done this.
00:14:25,00:14:29,"So for instance, in 1810, there was a woman called Elizabeth Dick"
00:14:29,00:14:31,"and her husband had put this advert out saying,"
00:14:31,00:14:32,"""No, it's not a funny name."
00:14:32,00:14:33,"""Come on."""
00:14:33,00:14:34,(audience laughs)
00:14:34,00:14:35,- How are you Fanny?
00:14:35,00:14:38,- Her husband had said that she'd gone without just calls.
00:14:38,00:14:40,"And so she posted an advert in the paper,"
00:14:40,00:14:41,"a couple of weeks later, saying,"
00:14:41,00:14:44,"""It is true that I left my husband's bed and board,"
00:14:44,00:14:47,"""but not before he made several attempts to murder me."""
00:14:47,00:14:49,(audience laughs)
00:14:49,00:14:50,- It used to do weird things.
00:14:50,00:14:52,"The my favorite thing that I read about this,"
00:14:52,00:14:54,"if there was a sort of marital dispute,"
00:14:54,00:14:57,there used to be a thing which was marital jewels.
00:14:57,00:14:58,Have you heard of that?
00:14:58,00:15:01,"So it's, you know, classic pistols at dawn,"
00:15:01,00:15:05,except this was husband versus wife to sort out an argument.
00:15:05,00:15:07,And there were specific rules about the marital jewel
00:15:07,00:15:09,that you had to hear by.
00:15:09,00:15:12,"So the basic rules were that you would go to the place,"
00:15:12,00:15:14,there would be an adjudicator.
00:15:14,00:15:17,The wife was armed with three rocks
00:15:17,00:15:19,and that she could wrap them around in cloth
00:15:19,00:15:22,to swing and hit the husband with.
00:15:22,00:15:24,And this is in the 1200s.
00:15:24,00:15:28,"The man basically had wooden clubs,"
00:15:28,00:15:30,but he had to have a disadvantage to the fight.
00:15:30,00:15:33,So his disadvantage was he had to have one arm tied
00:15:33,00:15:36,behind his back and he had to fight the jewel
00:15:36,00:15:38,from within a three-foot hole in the ground.
00:15:38,00:15:40,(audience laughs)
00:15:40,00:15:43,So he would be sat whacking away
00:15:43,00:15:46,"and she could stand, he could never leave the hole"
00:15:46,00:15:49,and she could run around and smack him with her rocks.
00:15:49,00:15:52,"And that was a real thing,"
00:15:52,00:15:56,and there's countless accounts of the marital jewel happening.
00:15:56,00:15:57,We should bring that back.
00:15:57,00:16:02,"- As a married man, I don't think we should bring that back."
00:16:02,00:16:03,"- Yeah, why did I say that?"
00:16:03,00:16:05,- We should certainly bring it back as a game.
00:16:05,00:16:07,"I mean, that is a fun game, you're standing in a hole."
00:16:07,00:16:10,"You've got, maybe let's make the club out of foam or something."
00:16:10,00:16:12,"- That's like a channel five game show, isn't it?"
00:16:12,00:16:13,- Yeah.
00:16:13,00:16:18,"- I forgot to tell you guys, I had a marital argument this morning"
00:16:18,00:16:19,but you forgot to tell us.
00:16:19,00:16:20,(audience laughs)
00:16:20,00:16:22,- It's something I didn't realize I did.
00:16:22,00:16:23,"I woke up in the morning and I was like,"
00:16:23,00:16:24,"""You okay?"""
00:16:24,00:16:27,"And she said, ""You slept all class night."""
00:16:27,00:16:28,"I was like, ""Did I?"""
00:16:28,00:16:29,What did I say?
00:16:29,00:16:32,"She said, ""You said, ""I have many secrets."""
00:16:32,00:16:35,(audience laughs)
00:16:35,00:16:38,And that was it.
00:16:38,00:16:41,She was up for the rest of the night.
00:16:41,00:16:44,"I was like, ""He's fucking secrets."""
00:16:44,00:16:45,Done.
00:16:45,00:16:46,She knows about the egg stealing.
00:16:46,00:16:48,(audience laughs)
00:16:48,00:16:52,- So I was looking at classified adverts in the newspaper.
00:16:52,00:16:54,That's the thing that happens.
00:16:54,00:16:57,So classified adverts were an enormous thing.
00:16:57,00:16:59,"You know, they kept loads of newspapers going"
00:16:59,00:17:00,in the days before Craigslist
00:17:00,00:17:02,and whatever people use these days.
00:17:02,00:17:06,But the London Review of Books used to have
00:17:06,00:17:09,the greatest personal's adverts to find love
00:17:09,00:17:10,out of any publication.
00:17:10,00:17:13,And people used to collect these and read them avidly.
00:17:13,00:17:15,"So they included things like,"
00:17:15,00:17:18,"these are all complete ones, by the way."
00:17:18,00:17:20,"Angry troll up, 37."
00:17:20,00:17:20,Offers?
00:17:20,00:17:23,(audience laughs)
00:17:23,00:17:26,Amazing.
00:17:26,00:17:27,There was another one.
00:17:27,00:17:30,"Less Venus in first, more Derek in Bucksdon."
00:17:30,00:17:32,(audience laughs)
00:17:32,00:17:33,Interested?
00:17:33,00:17:34,Right.
00:17:34,00:17:36,Right to Derek in Bucksdon.
00:17:36,00:17:37,(audience laughs)
00:17:37,00:17:39,"And this is my favorite, favorite, favorite, favorite one."
00:17:39,00:17:43,"Vegan love God on the brink of mental and physical collapse,"
00:17:43,00:17:47,"male 26, seeks pallid calcium deficient female"
00:17:47,00:17:49,"for nights of apathy, depression, and headaches"
00:17:49,00:17:51,while touring the moral high ground.
00:17:51,00:17:54,(audience laughs)
00:17:54,00:17:56,- So you mentioned Craigslist.
00:17:56,00:17:58,They have some really funny postings that have gone up
00:17:58,00:17:59,and a lot of them are jokes.
00:17:59,00:18:01,"But some of them, I was reading through, you know,"
00:18:01,00:18:03,their best ones they've had.
00:18:03,00:18:06,And some of them I think are real and incredibly sad.
00:18:06,00:18:08,So this was one posting on Craigslist a few years ago.
00:18:08,00:18:11,I need someone to hide Easter eggs in my apartment
00:18:11,00:18:12,when I'm not there.
00:18:12,00:18:14,They are small and filled with candy.
00:18:14,00:18:16,I would like to find them myself on Sunday.
00:18:16,00:18:19,I am willing to pay serious enquiries only.
00:18:19,00:18:21,"You want someone to, I know."
00:18:21,00:18:22,"- I mean, it sounds like someone weaning them"
00:18:22,00:18:24,"self off ex stealing, doesn't it?"
00:18:24,00:18:25,(audience laughs)
00:18:25,00:18:27,"Please, please, please ignore the rumful"
00:18:27,00:18:29,"of 10,000 eggs with mismatched labels."
00:18:29,00:18:31,(audience laughs)
00:18:31,00:18:33,And the man dressed as a crow in a car.
00:18:33,00:18:35,(audience laughs)
00:18:35,00:18:36,- There was another one.
00:18:36,00:18:39,There was one about a man who claimed
00:18:39,00:18:41,that he'd robbed a woman's purse.
00:18:41,00:18:43,But then he'd caught her eye after he was robbing it.
00:18:43,00:18:44,So he'd mugged a woman.
00:18:44,00:18:46,"He'd then he'd put an ad on Craigslist saying,"
00:18:46,00:18:48,"""Hi, I mugged you the other day."""
00:18:48,00:18:50,But then I caught your eye.
00:18:50,00:18:51,There was a quick moment when our eyes met
00:18:51,00:18:53,and I felt something strong.
00:18:53,00:18:54,I think you felt it too.
00:18:54,00:18:55,(audience laughs)
00:18:55,00:18:59,"If I wasn't so shy, brackets also committing a crime."
00:18:59,00:19:00,Close brackets.
00:19:00,00:19:02,I would have asked your name.
00:19:02,00:19:03,"I, of course, later got your name"
00:19:03,00:19:05,from your driver's license.
00:19:05,00:19:08,(audience laughs)
00:19:08,00:19:11,"So Jennifer, if you'd like to get together for a drink,"
00:19:11,00:19:12,please call me.
00:19:12,00:19:14,- I'm made. - I'm outside your front door.
00:19:14,00:19:15,(audience laughs)
00:19:15,00:19:16,Do you know that Guns and Roses
00:19:16,00:19:18,got together through a personal's advert?
00:19:18,00:19:19,- Did they? - Yeah.
00:19:19,00:19:21,"So there was, this used to be a thing"
00:19:21,00:19:22,for bands getting together.
00:19:22,00:19:24,So they were posted in music magazines
00:19:24,00:19:25,"and obviously which have a music you like,"
00:19:25,00:19:27,you posted in that magazine.
00:19:27,00:19:28,"So the advert said, ""Base player needed"
00:19:28,00:19:31,"""for band influenced by Aerosmith, Alice Cooper."""
00:19:31,00:19:32,- Call slash.
00:19:32,00:19:34,"- Oh, what? - Call slash."
00:19:34,00:19:34,- Call slash.
00:19:34,00:19:37,"- And they used to put the holes in the enemy,"
00:19:37,00:19:38,didn't they quite a lot?
00:19:38,00:19:39,I remember when I was growing up
00:19:39,00:19:40,and of course that's closed down today.
00:19:40,00:19:41,- Just today. - Yeah.
00:19:41,00:19:42,- What?
00:19:42,00:19:43,- Last issue goes out on Friday.
00:19:43,00:19:44,- You joking.
00:19:44,00:19:45,- No jokes.
00:19:45,00:19:47,"- Last chance if you want to get in a band, Andy."
00:19:47,00:19:48,(audience laughs)
00:19:48,00:19:49,- I thought I was in one.
00:19:49,00:19:50,(audience laughs)
00:19:50,00:19:52,So it was a weird sort of vocal band.
00:19:52,00:19:54,(audience laughs)
00:19:54,00:19:56,"- I think there's a problem in classifieds, right?"
00:19:56,00:19:57,When people are looking into the history of them
00:19:57,00:20:00,'cause you don't get any other extra information.
00:20:00,00:20:02,"So there's this really good looking book,"
00:20:02,00:20:04,"which is called ""Found Strange Red Cow."""
00:20:04,00:20:08,And it's called that because it's related to an advert
00:20:08,00:20:11,that was placed in the Pennsylvania Gazette in the 19th century
00:20:11,00:20:14,"which said, ""Found Strange Red Cow."""
00:20:14,00:20:15,And it was about a cow that wandered
00:20:15,00:20:16,onto someone's property
00:20:16,00:20:19,and will return to owner who proves that they own it.
00:20:19,00:20:22,But another example of one of the ads in this book
00:20:22,00:20:24,is 1892 in New York.
00:20:24,00:20:27,Wanted a young lady of German parentage
00:20:27,00:20:30,must be 36 inch bust
00:20:30,00:20:32,and understand bookkeeping on a small scale.
00:20:32,00:20:33,(audience laughs)
00:20:33,00:20:36,- What job requires?
00:20:36,00:20:37,All of those very specific issues.
00:20:37,00:20:38,- But I'm willing to compromise
00:20:38,00:20:40,on the bookkeeping on a small scale.
00:20:40,00:20:43,(audience laughs)
00:20:43,00:20:46,"- Okay, move on to fact number three."
00:20:46,00:20:47,And that is my fact.
00:20:47,00:20:50,My fact this week is that there is a bell
00:20:50,00:20:55,that's been ringing in Oxford nonstop for 178 years.
00:20:55,00:20:57,Yeah.
00:20:57,00:20:59,"- Yeah, you guys must be pissed off about that."
00:20:59,00:21:00,- Yeah.
00:21:00,00:21:01,- Sounds really annoying.
00:21:01,00:21:02,- The hometown fact or where we're recording
00:21:02,00:21:03,or home city fact.
00:21:03,00:21:06,"It's, this is in the Clarendon Laboratory."
00:21:06,00:21:09,It's a 10 minute walk from where we are right now.
00:21:09,00:21:11,"And back in 1840, they set this up"
00:21:11,00:21:14,with a new experimental battery that they wanted to test out.
00:21:14,00:21:16,"And effectively, it's two batteries"
00:21:16,00:21:18,and a little bell hanging between
00:21:18,00:21:21,and it oscillates and just goes between the two bells.
00:21:21,00:21:23,And they thought it would last for a while.
00:21:23,00:21:25,"But since 1840, it has not stopped."
00:21:25,00:21:26,It is still going.
00:21:26,00:21:27,I visited it today.
00:21:27,00:21:28,You can go and see it.
00:21:28,00:21:29,"- Oh, did you?"
00:21:29,00:21:31,"- And you look really close and it's just tingling, tingling."
00:21:31,00:21:32,- It's just tiny here at Dinging.
00:21:32,00:21:33,"- No, I made the noise."
00:21:33,00:21:38,It's behind two bits of very thick glass
00:21:38,00:21:39,"and then it's in a thicker, a bit of glass"
00:21:39,00:21:41,even so once you get to it.
00:21:41,00:21:42,- I don't know it's Dinging then.
00:21:42,00:21:43,- 'Cause I made the noise.
00:21:43,00:21:47,"- We don't know what noise it's making if any,"
00:21:47,00:21:49,but you can see it physically.
00:21:49,00:21:50,"- Well, it's likely to be a Dinging."
00:21:50,00:21:51,- It's one of those things when you see it.
00:21:51,00:21:52,"You're like, tingling, tingling."
00:21:52,00:21:55,It's got the motion of that.
00:21:55,00:21:57,"And yeah, so this has been going"
00:21:57,00:21:58,and it's battery powered.
00:21:58,00:21:59,This is what's most impressive.
00:21:59,00:22:02,It's not as if it's a perpetual motion or anything.
00:22:02,00:22:04,Which would actually be more impressive.
00:22:04,00:22:05,- Yeah.
00:22:05,00:22:09,- Given how that would break the laws of the universe.
00:22:09,00:22:13,"- No, I don't want to show this over the science first."
00:22:13,00:22:16,It's another perpetual motion thing I've built.
00:22:16,00:22:19,- The problem is is that because they don't know
00:22:19,00:22:21,"the exact composer of what's going inside it,"
00:22:21,00:22:23,they need to just leave it
00:22:23,00:22:26,because the experiment now is how long will this go for.
00:22:26,00:22:27,It's like Schroddinger's battery.
00:22:27,00:22:31,"If you touch it and go in, you ruin the experiment."
00:22:31,00:22:33,"So yeah, so they're just going to wait it out."
00:22:33,00:22:34,It's a long-term experiment.
00:22:34,00:22:37,"- The best guess is that it's 2,000 alternate layers"
00:22:37,00:22:40,of metal foil and paper coated with manganese dioxide
00:22:40,00:22:43,and honey compressed into a glass tube
00:22:43,00:22:46,and sealed from humidity in a casing of sulphur.
00:22:46,00:22:47,- Honey!
00:22:47,00:22:47,"- That is, honey."
00:22:47,00:22:49,"- That's a good guess, isn't it?"
00:22:49,00:22:51,(all laughing)
00:22:51,00:22:54,"- You were close, but it was peanut butter."
00:22:54,00:22:57,(all laughing)
00:22:57,00:22:59,"I just find it amazing that this stuff doesn't erode,"
00:22:59,00:23:04,"which I know metals are very erosion proof,"
00:23:04,00:23:09,"but the clapper has struck the bell 10,911,456,000 times"
00:23:09,00:23:12,since it started.
00:23:12,00:23:15,That's like almost 11 billion times.
00:23:15,00:23:18,"- Yeah, they think that the physical bell will break"
00:23:18,00:23:20,before the battery itself breaks.
00:23:20,00:23:22,"'Cause there's a lot of metallic dust at the bottom,"
00:23:22,00:23:25,"isn't there, where it's kind of eroded over time?"
00:23:25,00:23:25,- Yeah.
00:23:25,00:23:27,"- But you know what, this experiment is called"
00:23:27,00:23:30,the Oxford Dry Pile experiment
00:23:30,00:23:32,and it's been going longer than physics.
00:23:32,00:23:35,(all laughing)
00:23:35,00:23:38,"By which I mean that it was bought in 1840,"
00:23:38,00:23:40,"like you say, by Reverend Robert Walker"
00:23:40,00:23:43,and he was a reader in experimental philosophy
00:23:43,00:23:45,and that's what they called physics back then.
00:23:45,00:23:47,So it's before you had physics professors.
00:23:47,00:23:48,"- Yeah, wow."
00:23:48,00:23:49,"- That's cool, isn't it?"
00:23:49,00:23:50,- That is cool.
00:23:50,00:23:52,"- Also, the battery was effectively made in 1825."
00:23:52,00:23:56,"They started ringing it as a bell in 1840,"
00:23:56,00:23:59,"but Walter, with the first batteries, was 1800."
00:23:59,00:24:02,"So in 25 years, they created a battery"
00:24:02,00:24:05,that is still running today and just nailed it.
00:24:05,00:24:07,"- I imagine when it stops, they'll be like,"
00:24:07,00:24:08,have you tried rubbing it?
00:24:08,00:24:11,(all laughing)
00:24:11,00:24:12,"- I think we should say,"
00:24:12,00:24:13,'cause I think there's been a few moments
00:24:13,00:24:17,"where it has stopped due to humidity and stuff like that,"
00:24:17,00:24:18,but it's always come back on.
00:24:18,00:24:20,- Does anyone else have a problem with dry pile being
00:24:20,00:24:22,a way for this incredible?
00:24:22,00:24:23,- Terrible problem with dry piles.
00:24:23,00:24:24,(all laughing)
00:24:24,00:24:28,"My notes are all about completely different stuff, actually."
00:24:28,00:24:30,It's mostly a list of pharmacists
00:24:30,00:24:31,that I've visited today.
00:24:31,00:24:33,(all laughing)
00:24:33,00:24:35,- It's an unfortunate name
00:24:35,00:24:37,"who was an extremely important piece of, you know,"
00:24:37,00:24:40,"physical progress, but the Voltaic pile"
00:24:40,00:24:45,invented by Volta of voltage fame is what it's basically based on.
00:24:45,00:24:48,"And I didn't actually realize how they worked,"
00:24:48,00:24:51,but basically it's just the Voltaic pile
00:24:51,00:24:54,is alternating layers of two different types of metal.
00:24:54,00:24:58,"And if you've got metals of two different chemical components,"
00:24:58,00:25:00,then charge will travel between them.
00:25:00,00:25:03,"If you put like salty watery paper between them,"
00:25:03,00:25:05,"so that allows electricity to conduct,"
00:25:05,00:25:07,'cause you've got this watery salty paper.
00:25:07,00:25:10,So the metal slightly dissolves into that paper.
00:25:10,00:25:12,"And then when they touch each other,"
00:25:12,00:25:14,then the current travels through them
00:25:14,00:25:16,and a circuit is created.
00:25:16,00:25:18,So it's just a pile of metal with a wet paper in between.
00:25:18,00:25:19,- It was bizarre.
00:25:19,00:25:20,- That's electricity.
00:25:20,00:25:23,- And he's the guy who demonstrated electricity
00:25:23,00:25:26,"first by electrocuting loads of frogs, right?"
00:25:26,00:25:28,"Volta, so he--"
00:25:28,00:25:29,- And Galvani as well.
00:25:29,00:25:33,"- And Galvani, so these were the two electricity pioneers"
00:25:33,00:25:34,of the early 19th century.
00:25:34,00:25:36,"And they were kind of for this fight,"
00:25:36,00:25:39,because Volta used to put two different types of metal
00:25:39,00:25:40,on a dead frog's leg.
00:25:40,00:25:42,And the frog's leg would twitch.
00:25:42,00:25:44,"And he'd say, look, that shows that these two different metals"
00:25:44,00:25:45,are creating electricity.
00:25:45,00:25:48,"And Galvani, from where we get the word Galvanise,"
00:25:48,00:25:51,"said, no, no, it's because the frog's leg"
00:25:51,00:25:53,is generating electricity.
00:25:53,00:25:56,"And he thought that dead animal, you know,"
00:25:56,00:25:58,bit created electricity.
00:25:58,00:25:59,So he turns out he was wrong.
00:25:59,00:26:01,"- But we could have had a world where instead of a battery,"
00:26:01,00:26:03,you have to shove a dead frog's leg
00:26:03,00:26:05,into the back of your torch.
00:26:05,00:26:06,- A better world.
00:26:06,00:26:07,- A better world.
00:26:07,00:26:08,(laughing)
00:26:08,00:26:09,- Do you know Volta did an experiment
00:26:09,00:26:11,just after he invented the Voltaic pile
00:26:11,00:26:14,where he found out that electricity takes sour.
00:26:14,00:26:17,And the way that he did this was he got a number of volunteers
00:26:17,00:26:18,to form a chain.
00:26:18,00:26:21,"And they each pinched the tongue of the person,"
00:26:21,00:26:22,"I won't do it Andy, don't worry."
00:26:22,00:26:24,Of the person next to them.
00:26:24,00:26:26,And so they were all in a chain pinching each other's tongue.
00:26:26,00:26:29,And then he put some electricity going through them.
00:26:29,00:26:31,And everyone could taste the fingers
00:26:31,00:26:34,of the person next to them going sour.
00:26:34,00:26:35,- Really?
00:26:35,00:26:36,- That's a good experiment.
00:26:36,00:26:38,- But how do you get the volunteers for that
00:26:38,00:26:39,in your class of mind ever?
00:26:39,00:26:42,"Wanted, what are the volunteers for wacky stuff?"
00:26:42,00:26:43,(laughing)
00:26:43,00:26:44,"Actually, we don't have electricity."
00:26:44,00:26:46,"And he'd say, come and taste my fingers."
00:26:46,00:26:48,(laughing)
00:26:48,00:26:50,Taste my finger was the Victorian equivalent
00:26:50,00:26:51,of pull my finger actually.
00:26:51,00:26:53,(laughing)
00:26:53,00:26:55,"- Do you know, just on how batteries work"
00:26:55,00:26:58,"and how, you know, electrical current flows."
00:26:58,00:27:00,"In the 19th century, there were a lot of cases"
00:27:00,00:27:02,of exploding teeth.
00:27:02,00:27:05,And I know it sounds like those two sentences are unrelated.
00:27:05,00:27:08,"But they've realized, people have realized"
00:27:08,00:27:09,that the most likely explanation for this
00:27:09,00:27:11,is that people used to have teeth
00:27:11,00:27:12,"that were made of metal, obviously."
00:27:12,00:27:14,And they would often be two different types of metal.
00:27:14,00:27:16,And there were all these dentist records
00:27:16,00:27:18,and doctors records of exploding teeth.
00:27:18,00:27:21,"Like, people would be in huge amounts of pain."
00:27:21,00:27:22,And they'd feel like there was an electric current
00:27:22,00:27:23,going into their gums.
00:27:23,00:27:25,And then their teeth would explode.
00:27:25,00:27:27,And it's actually because they literally
00:27:27,00:27:29,were turning their mouths into a battery.
00:27:29,00:27:30,So if you had these two different types of metal
00:27:30,00:27:32,"and they were making contact,"
00:27:32,00:27:34,then there was a circuit running around your mouth.
00:27:34,00:27:37,"- Well, and that's what happens if you have a filling"
00:27:37,00:27:38,"and you bite a bit of metal,"
00:27:38,00:27:39,"you're making a tiny little battery there,"
00:27:39,00:27:40,aren't you? - Yeah.
00:27:40,00:27:41,- That's why that's so painful.
00:27:41,00:27:42,- Really?
00:27:42,00:27:43,- Yeah.
00:27:43,00:27:43,- Is that painful?
00:27:43,00:27:44,- Yeah.
00:27:44,00:27:47,(laughing)
00:27:47,00:27:48,"- I was looking a bit into,"
00:27:48,00:27:50,'cause this is a long-term experiment
00:27:50,00:27:51,that's been going on.
00:27:51,00:27:53,I just looked into long-term experiments.
00:27:53,00:27:56,And I found one which I thought was really interesting.
00:27:56,00:27:59,There was a paper that was published in 1998
00:27:59,00:28:00,"and the title of it was,"
00:28:00,00:28:03,"""Does knuckle cracking lead to arthritis of the fingers?"""
00:28:03,00:28:08,"And this was written by a scientist called Donald Unger,"
00:28:08,00:28:12,who basically for 60 years cracked his knuckles
00:28:12,00:28:14,in order to work out if it was arthritis
00:28:14,00:28:15,that you would get off the back of it.
00:28:15,00:28:17,"He did it because when he was a kid,"
00:28:17,00:28:19,"his mother and his aunties said to him,"
00:28:19,00:28:21,"""Stop cracking your knuckles, you're gonna get arthritis."""
00:28:21,00:28:22,"And he thought, ""No, I'm not."""
00:28:22,00:28:25,"So he said, ""60 years on the left hand alone,"
00:28:25,00:28:26,"cracking his knuckles."""
00:28:26,00:28:28,And then he didn't crack his right hand.
00:28:28,00:28:29,- Exactly.
00:28:29,00:28:30,So it started as a kid.
00:28:30,00:28:33,Just was like every day he would crack his knuckles
00:28:33,00:28:34,"and he got to the end and his answer was,"
00:28:34,00:28:36,"""No, it doesn't give you arthritis."""
00:28:36,00:28:38,"- Although, that seems like a very petty thing"
00:28:38,00:28:40,to spite your mother for 60 years.
00:28:40,00:28:41,- Yeah.
00:28:41,00:28:43,- It was an unhealthy relationship.
00:28:43,00:28:44,- Okay.
00:28:44,00:28:45,I have done further papers and it turns out
00:28:45,00:28:47,the broccoli is not delicious.
00:28:47,00:28:50,(audience laughing)
00:28:50,00:28:55,"And it turns out, I won't go blind if I keep doing that."
00:28:55,00:28:59,(audience laughing)
00:28:59,00:29:00,- Should we move on to our final fact?
00:29:00,00:29:01,- Yeah.
00:29:01,00:29:03,"- Okay, it is our final fact of the show"
00:29:03,00:29:05,and that is Andy.
00:29:05,00:29:07,- My fact is that King Edward VII
00:29:07,00:29:10,had a liquor invented specifically for him to drink
00:29:10,00:29:11,while driving.
00:29:11,00:29:14,(audience laughing)
00:29:14,00:29:17,This was very pretty health and safety.
00:29:17,00:29:19,"So there's a drink, it's called the King's Ginger"
00:29:19,00:29:21,'cause it was named for him.
00:29:21,00:29:24,He was the first monarch to drive a car.
00:29:24,00:29:26,He was driving from about 1898.
00:29:26,00:29:27,He was an early adopter.
00:29:27,00:29:28,He became King in 1901.
00:29:28,00:29:31,"And he was a huge fan of drinking,"
00:29:31,00:29:34,"but he was driving around on quite chilly mores,"
00:29:34,00:29:35,open top cars.
00:29:35,00:29:38,"And his doctor, this is the story of the drink,"
00:29:38,00:29:40,was worried that he might get cold and chilly.
00:29:40,00:29:43,"So instead of giving him medical advice,"
00:29:43,00:29:47,he just asked a wine merchant to invent a new alcohol for him.
00:29:47,00:29:49,And it's very gingery and it's called King's Ginger.
00:29:49,00:29:50,"- And it still exists, right?"
00:29:50,00:29:51,- It still exists.
00:29:51,00:29:54,"And actually, I've brought some along with me tonight."
00:29:54,00:29:55,- That's so good.
00:29:55,00:29:57,- My wine was literally about to run out.
00:29:57,00:29:58,"- Well, have you got a cup?"
00:29:58,00:29:59,- I've got four.
00:29:59,00:30:01,"I did try and find shot glasses in my house,"
00:30:01,00:30:04,"but due to my lifestyle, I've got one."
00:30:04,00:30:08,(audience laughing)
00:30:08,00:30:12,"I've then got two measuring shot glasses,"
00:30:12,00:30:14,which he used for K&Pepa.
00:30:14,00:30:15,(audience laughing)
00:30:15,00:30:18,And I've got one shot glass I borrowed from the venue.
00:30:18,00:30:19,Thank you very much.
00:30:19,00:30:20,(audience laughing)
00:30:20,00:30:23,"So if you'd like to, oh, Cracky."
00:30:23,00:30:24,- I'm not driving home later.
00:30:24,00:30:25,Am I still allowed to drink it?
00:30:25,00:30:27,(audience laughing)
00:30:27,00:30:30,- We don't normally finish with alcohol consumption on stage.
00:30:30,00:30:32,"Sorry, we normally start with it, but."
00:30:32,00:30:34,(audience laughing)
00:30:34,00:30:36,"And it's shot at it, right."
00:30:36,00:30:37,- It was a shot glass.
00:30:37,00:30:40,(audience laughing)
00:30:40,00:30:43,(audience cheering)
00:30:43,00:30:47,"- Okay, should we talk about facts and stuff?"
00:30:47,00:30:48,"- Yeah, sure."
00:30:48,00:30:50,"- Oh yeah, ever the seventh."
00:30:50,00:30:53,"He liked drinking, he liked generally having a good time,"
00:30:53,00:30:54,"didn't he, ever the seventh?"
00:30:54,00:30:57,"So old Bertie, one of the things he was famous for"
00:30:57,00:31:02,"was having a siège d'amour or a loft chair,"
00:31:02,00:31:05,"which is an item which I think still exists today,"
00:31:05,00:31:08,"but it was made for his own personal use,"
00:31:08,00:31:10,"a brothel called Lushabane,"
00:31:10,00:31:12,which was a very famous brothel in Paris.
00:31:12,00:31:14,"And if you should look it up, the loft chair,"
00:31:14,00:31:16,"if ever the seventh, and apparently it's made for him"
00:31:16,00:31:18,to have sex with two women at the same time.
00:31:18,00:31:21,"It's a bizarre contraption, it's got stirrups on it,"
00:31:21,00:31:23,it's got hand grips on it.
00:31:23,00:31:25,"I've steered it for about 45 minutes today,"
00:31:25,00:31:26,and I cannot for the life of me work out
00:31:26,00:31:28,how you could have sex with one person.
00:31:28,00:31:31,"- Let alone two, using this chair."
00:31:31,00:31:32,"- But he was worried, wasn't he,"
00:31:32,00:31:35,"because he got quite massive later in life,"
00:31:35,00:31:37,"and so his main worry was he didn't,"
00:31:37,00:31:39,"he was having a lot of sex still with a lot of people,"
00:31:39,00:31:42,and he didn't want to crush them while he was having sex.
00:31:42,00:31:43,That was his decision.
00:31:43,00:31:48,So the chair gave him the sort of the uncrushability
00:31:48,00:31:51,that he was looking for when having a minasie toire.
00:31:51,00:31:53,"- Yeah. - And can I just say quickly,"
00:31:53,00:31:55,"because I know we're in England,"
00:31:55,00:31:57,"and everyone knows who Edward the seventh is,"
00:31:57,00:32:00,"but as you know, there's little else spoken about"
00:32:00,00:32:03,"these days, contemporary national discourse."
00:32:03,00:32:07,"But for international listeners, he was the son of Queen Victoria."
00:32:07,00:32:11,"He was born in 1841, which, for context of this podcast,"
00:32:11,00:32:14,was one year after the bell started ringing in Oxford.
00:32:14,00:32:16,(audience laughs)
00:32:16,00:32:18,"And he was, yeah, he was known as Dirty Bertie."
00:32:18,00:32:22,"He was such a odd character, but very influential as well."
00:32:22,00:32:24,A lot of things have gone through history
00:32:24,00:32:27,"that are said to be, as a result of him,"
00:32:27,00:32:30,one we know for sure is the fact that the royals get two birthdays.
00:32:30,00:32:31,The Queen has two birthdays.
00:32:31,00:32:32,That's down to him.
00:32:32,00:32:34,Because his birthday was at a bad time.
00:32:34,00:32:35,It was in a wintery time.
00:32:35,00:32:37,"So he said, ""I want a more a summary one."""
00:32:37,00:32:39,So he gave himself a second birthday.
00:32:39,00:32:41,So that's down to him.
00:32:41,00:32:43,Some royal drinks.
00:32:43,00:32:44,"- Oh, yeah. - All right."
00:32:44,00:32:47,"- So you said Queen Victoria, who was his mother?"
00:32:47,00:32:49,- Yes. - Her favorite drink was whiskey
00:32:49,00:32:52,and red wine mixed together.
00:32:52,00:32:53,"- Yeah, that's true."
00:32:53,00:32:54,"I think we found out from Gladstone,"
00:32:54,00:32:56,"didn't we, a Prime Minister of the 19th century?"
00:32:56,00:32:59,"And yeah, he did not like the idea."
00:32:59,00:33:03,"He wrote, ""She has her claret strengthened,"
00:33:03,00:33:06,"""and I should have thought spoiled with whiskey,"
00:33:06,00:33:07,"""but that was her drink."""
00:33:07,00:33:10,"Kate Middleton likes crack, baby."
00:33:10,00:33:14,"- Sorry. - Hey, never called me baby again."
00:33:14,00:33:16,(laughing)
00:33:16,00:33:19,"That was a very legally contentious statement, James."
00:33:19,00:33:20,It's a cocktail.
00:33:20,00:33:21,There's no crack in it.
00:33:21,00:33:23,"It's called vodka, raspberry liqueur,"
00:33:23,00:33:25,passion fruit and champagne.
00:33:25,00:33:27,"It's called crack, baby."
00:33:27,00:33:28,That's one of her favorite drinks.
00:33:28,00:33:30,Did you know that there is a new drink
00:33:30,00:33:31,that's been invented called a Voktail?
00:33:31,00:33:32,This is from last year.
00:33:32,00:33:34,It's by the University of Singapore
00:33:34,00:33:36,and it's a virtual cocktail.
00:33:36,00:33:38,"So it's a special glass,"
00:33:38,00:33:39,"which can make you think you're drinking alcohol,"
00:33:39,00:33:41,even though you're not.
00:33:41,00:33:43,- Sounds awful. - It's got three methods.
00:33:43,00:33:45,"So you pour a liquid in, you pour just normal water in"
00:33:45,00:33:48,and then there's a light that goes on in the glass.
00:33:48,00:33:50,"So already you think, ""Oh, it's a lovely red cocktail,"""
00:33:50,00:33:54,"whatever, then there are electrodes all around the rim"
00:33:54,00:33:55,where you can alter the sweetness
00:33:55,00:33:57,or the saltiness or the bitterness
00:33:57,00:33:59,"by stimulating the tongue with a small electric current,"
00:33:59,00:34:00,like--
00:34:00,00:34:02,"- Valter. - Yeah, man, vulter."
00:34:02,00:34:03,"And finally, there's a tube in the side"
00:34:03,00:34:05,which releases gases to make you think
00:34:05,00:34:06,that you're drinking something else.
00:34:06,00:34:08,So you can think you're drinking lemonade
00:34:08,00:34:09,even though you're drinking water.
00:34:09,00:34:11,And then do they smack you over the head
00:34:11,00:34:12,so you have a headache in the morning?
00:34:12,00:34:14,(laughing)
00:34:14,00:34:18,"Hey, we're gonna have to wrap up shortly."
00:34:18,00:34:21,Do you guys have anything before we do?
00:34:21,00:34:22,I've had so much kings to enjoy.
00:34:22,00:34:23,"I can't really see any more, though."
00:34:23,00:34:25,(laughing)
00:34:26,00:34:29,"I got one last thing which I really like,"
00:34:29,00:34:32,which is that there's a lot of celebrity alcohols
00:34:32,00:34:33,that have been released over the years.
00:34:33,00:34:37,"And my favorite, like ACDC, do wine, iron maiden, do beer,"
00:34:37,00:34:41,"Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie and Danny DeVito,"
00:34:41,00:34:42,they all have their different wines.
00:34:42,00:34:44,"My favorite one is that the band Hanson,"
00:34:44,00:34:46,"famous for the song ""Umbop,"""
00:34:46,00:34:50,"they released their own beer, which they called ""Umbops."""
00:34:50,00:34:53,And that's available at shops.
00:34:53,00:34:55,"It shops, I think you'll find it."
00:34:55,00:34:58,(laughing)
00:34:58,00:34:59,"Okay, that is it."
00:34:59,00:35:00,That is all of our facts.
00:35:00,00:35:01,Thank you so much for listening.
00:35:01,00:35:03,If you'd like to get in contact with any of us
00:35:03,00:35:05,about the things that we've set over the course

00:35:26,00:35:29,"our cassette, when we're about to give one away."
00:35:29,00:35:30,Because we ask the audience here in Oxford
00:35:30,00:35:32,to give us a fact.
00:35:32,00:35:34,"Their favorite fact, James is picked a winner."
00:35:34,00:35:38,"So the winner is, it is Ryan O'Reilly."
00:35:38,00:35:42,"The fact is that in 2005, Babu, a male red panda,"
00:35:42,00:35:46,"a Birmingham nature center in Birmingham, escaped."
00:35:46,00:35:49,He was subsequently named Brummy of the Year.
00:35:49,00:35:52,(laughing)
00:35:53,00:35:54,Amazing.
00:35:54,00:35:55,What for escaping Birmingham?
00:35:55,00:35:58,(laughing)
00:35:58,00:36:01,Ryan come find us outside at the end of the show.
00:36:01,00:36:02,We'll give you a cassette.
00:36:02,00:36:05,"And this is, we're not selling them anywhere else."
00:36:05,00:36:06,"So if anyone wants one, they're going to be out in the foyer."
00:36:06,00:36:08,"We're going to be out there as well, signing them."
00:36:08,00:36:10,"Guys, thank you so much for being here."
00:36:10,00:36:12,We'll be back again next week with another episode.
00:36:12,00:36:12,Goodbye.
00:36:12,00:36:15,(audience cheering)
00:36:15,00:36:18,(upbeat music)
00:36:19,00:36:22,(audience cheering)
