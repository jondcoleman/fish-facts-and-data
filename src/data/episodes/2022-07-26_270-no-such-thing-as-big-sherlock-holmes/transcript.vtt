00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.000
 Hello and welcome to another episode of no such thing as a fish, a weekly podcast.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
 This week coming to you live from Morish!

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
 (Cheering and applause)

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:44.000
 My name is Dan Schreiber. I am sitting here with Aniches Zinski, Andrew Huntsomari, and James Harkin. And once again, we have gathered around the microphones with our four favorite facts from the last seven days. And in no particular order, here we go.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:01:00.000
 Starting this week with my fact, fact number one, and that is, for the last four years, there has been an annual academic conference dedicated to the archers.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.000
 (Laughter)

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:18.000
 Yep, where speakers present lectures on big unanswered questions such as, "How is it possible the characters can eat so many cakes and pies but never suffer from diabetes?"

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.000
 (Laughter)

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.000
 Do we know the answer to that?

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.000
 Well, the lecture I haven't actually heard the lecture.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:35.000
 I know the answer to that, so I looked into, this is called the Ambridge Paradox. And the scientists who presented the paper made some guesses as to why this might be.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:41.000
 So firstly, fitness levels are very high because, as she says, birthday cards are always delivered by hand.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.000
 (Laughter)

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:53.000
 Messages that could be texted or emails are always relayed face to face. And residents quite often walk long distances just to ask when a relative will be home for tea, or if they would like a coffee.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.000
 (Laughter)

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:58.000
 Did they not also say, "It's all made up?"

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.000
 That was a feature of this lecture.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:08.000
 I think they said as well, lemon drizzle is a cake that they eat a lot. And there's something about what's in lemon drizzle that means that it knocks out.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:11.000
 I know, I know. (Laughter)

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:18.000
 But it's worth saying that these are not just fans who were comedians or whatever are trying to make a point about a comedic lecture.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:24.000
 These are real lecturers. This is a genuine thing. This was set up by three people who love the archers.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:32.000
 One is from a date modern called Kara Courage. And then there's an Oxford University person. There's a sterling university person.

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:35.000
 There's an Oxford University person.

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:37.000
 Yeah, Nicola Hadlam.

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.000
 Talking about the archers.

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:40.000
 (Laughter)

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:41.000
 Wow.

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:43.000
 This university education gone downhill.

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:48.000
 It's just, it's brainy people who happen to listen to the archers and be academics.

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:52.000
 But they have genuine academics who will present an idea or a lecture.

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:57.000
 This is the fourth year that's going to happen. Happening April 5th. So this podcast will have gone out by then most likely.

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:02.000
 So I saw some other of the lectures that they had there.

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:14.000
 Big telephoto lens, small tick list, bird watching, class, and masculinity in Ambridge. I was one of them. And my past nips are bigger than your past nips.

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:15.000
 (Laughter)

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:19.000
 The negative aspects of competing at Flower and Produce shows.

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:21.000
 That's really good.

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:26.000
 And make it through because it's obviously such a, you know, it's been going 60 plus years the archers.

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:28.000
 And so there's so much to pick on.

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:31.000
 Should you say what the archers is for Americans who are listening?

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:33.000
 Absolutely. We just plow on and don't explain it.

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:36.000
 (Laughter)

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:38.000
 See if you can possibly piece it together by the end.

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:43.000
 So yeah, it's an extremely long running series on Radio 4. It goes out twice a day.

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:45.000
 Should we say what Radio 4 is for America?

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:46.000
 Oh my goodness.

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:51.000
 Which is a great radio station, which does radio. I don't know how to make it.

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:55.000
 It's a long running drama. And it's been going for 60 plus years.

00:03:55.000 --> 00:04:03.000
 And yeah, so they do pick up on, so the talks do also include the absence of primary education in the archers.

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:10.000
 Why is there no primary? There's stuff about the flower rotor at the local church who is doing all the flowers.

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:14.000
 Who could possibly do this? Why do so many of them not die is another one.

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:15.000
 Oh yeah.

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:20.000
 Well, it's like the antidote to all other soap. So yeah, it was started in 1951, so that's so long ago.

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:28.000
 No one has ever been murdered. Now, as someone who watched EastEnders as a kid, I find this extraordinary.

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:33.000
 Yeah, because it's based on a village, isn't it, in Worcestershire called Inc. Barrow?

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:34.000
 Yeah.

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:36.000
 Okay, which is a tiny little village where nothing ever happens.

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:41.000
 But actually the crime rate in this village is much, much lower than in the archers.

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:48.000
 So for every hundred people, the amount of crime in the village of Inc. Barrow, which is real, is 1.8 crimes.

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:49.000
 Right.

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:55.000
 And in Ambridge, it's 0.9 crimes. So it's your half as likely to have crime against you in Ambridge, as you are.

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:56.000
 No way.

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:57.000
 The fictional place.

00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:58.000
 Yeah. That's great.

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:05.000
 Whereas EastEnders, if you live in Wolford, your three times more likely to be murdered.

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:11.000
 There have been sort of killing off, so there was a big controversy.

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:15.000
 This is way back when, on the very night that ITV launched, which was the 50s, I think.

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:17.000
 Yeah, 55.

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:21.000
 Grace Archer, one of the main characters, one of the members of the Archer family,

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:28.000
 her character was bumped off, and it was to draw attention away from ITV so that people wouldn't watch it.

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:31.000
 Well, obviously that worked really well.

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:33.000
 You know it actually wasn't because of that.

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:38.000
 Because, well, they always denied it, and this thing came out recently.

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:43.000
 So the woman who played Grace Archer is a woman called Esan Churchman.

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:47.000
 She kept on being asked, after 1955, why is your character been killed off?

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:50.000
 And she always said dead girls tell no tales.

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:55.000
 And then, aged 90, in 2015, she spilled the beans.

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:58.000
 And first of all, she said, ready if I had no idea it was going to be such a big thing.

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:03.000
 So everyone thought it was to overshadow ITV, and maybe it was, maybe they're still lying.

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:05.000
 But they said they had no idea it was going to be such a big deal.

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:08.000
 The reason they killed her was because she'd been asking for equal pay.

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:15.000
 And they tried to exile her already. She'd been exiled to Ireland the year before.

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:17.000
 Within the show.

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:20.000
 Within the show, sorry.

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:25.000
 I don't think Rainier Four has the power to exile people.

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:30.000
 Yes, for the Americans, the producers of the Archers also make the laws of England.

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:32.000
 Well, so what do you mean they tried to exile her?

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:35.000
 Was she just the actor walking back into the studio?

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:36.000
 No.

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:37.000
 I'm back.

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:39.000
 They sent her to Ireland in the show.

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:42.000
 And the public outcry was so much because she was such a popular character

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:45.000
 that they were like, we'd better write her back in, but we've got to off this one.

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:47.000
 So this used to happen quite a bit.

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:51.000
 So there's a guy who plays a doctor, or until recently, I think he played a doctor on the Archers.

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:53.000
 And he was originally rejected.

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:55.000
 He auditioned for the role of a doctor.

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:58.000
 And he was rejected because they said he didn't sound enough like a doctor to play a doctor.

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:00.000
 I say he said, fine.

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:02.000
 So he was given a different role on the show.

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:05.000
 But he could only do Thursday afternoons and weekends because he worked as a doctor.

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:13.000
 So anyway, so there were times when he needed kind of to be in a scene, but he wasn't available

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:15.000
 because he was busy in a GP surgery.

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:18.000
 So the way they got around it was, they just had his wife ask questions,

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:22.000
 and he was supposedly in another room and didn't hear them and did not say.

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:24.000
 This is about time.

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:25.000
 Wow.

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:27.000
 But they do have characters who never speak, don't they?

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:28.000
 I mean, I've never listened to it.

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:32.000
 But apparently there were more than 500 characters who are known to the audience

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:34.000
 who have never spoken a single word in the show.

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:35.000
 Wow.

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:40.000
 So there's a guy called Shane, who has never said anything, but is known to the audience

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:47.000
 is someone who did the cooking at Nelson's Wine Bar in the 80s and was famed for his legendary teach.

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:50.000
 There was a person called Mandy Beesborough.

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:55.000
 She had a daughter called India, whom Oliver and Caroline's foster child, Carly,

00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:59.000
 described as having an asked the size of a continent.

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:01.000
 And she never spoke.

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:03.000
 And there's a guy called Derek Fletcher, who's an Incomer.

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:05.000
 So he came in from somewhere else.

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:12.000
 And he never ever speaks, but as a joke, they always describe him as excessively talkative.

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:13.000
 Very good.

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:14.000
 Very fun.

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:18.000
 There was a guy who's actually got a Guinness World Record for playing a character so long,

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:20.000
 so consistently on the archers.

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:23.000
 His name was Norman Painting, and he played a character called Phil Archer.

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:25.000
 And he'd been doing it.

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:30.000
 The Guinness Record was for doing the same role without a break for more than 50 years.

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:33.000
 So he passed away in 2009.

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:40.000
 But he clearly really wanted a break, because he started penning Archer's episodes himself

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:42.000
 under a pseudonym, which was Bruno Milner.

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:45.000
 And in them, he kept writing his own character out.

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:48.000
 Did he keep trying to kill himself to Ireland?

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:49.000
 Exactly.

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:50.000
 Not kill himself.

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:53.000
 Just like, oh, he's gone off to Ireland this week or whatever.

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:55.000
 Just to give himself a break from the show.

00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:57.000
 Well, because it's such a stressful job.

00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:00.000
 Why, yeah, maybe just... It probably is.

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:02.000
 We know someone in the archers.

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:03.000
 We do.

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:04.000
 Yes.

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:05.000
 I contacted him today.

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:09.000
 So one of the QILs, her husband, played a character in the archers.

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:11.000
 I think he's called Paul.

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:12.000
 And so I answered...

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:13.000
 So the character's called Paul.

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:14.000
 He's called Paul.

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:15.000
 Yes.

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:17.000
 Who got, was getting off with Lillian?

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:19.000
 Again, the character is getting off with Lillian.

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:21.000
 The character Lillian.

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:22.000
 Yes.

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:23.000
 And Lillian.

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:26.000
 And what he said about this was, when we had to do sex scenes,

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:29.000
 it was Lillian's this perennial sex bomb, he says,

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:30.000
 in the archers.

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:32.000
 Didn't realise they had those.

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:35.000
 Whereas the actress is, in fact, gay and happily married,

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:37.000
 whereas she plays this heterosexual sex bomb.

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:40.000
 So Mike, our friend, said, when we had to do sex scenes,

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:43.000
 we both preferred to actually kiss rather than kiss with our hands

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:46.000
 and try to come off and make kissing sounds at the same time.

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:48.000
 It's much easier if you just kiss.

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:49.000
 So...

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:51.000
 Oh, so they did the actual...

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:53.000
 Instead of sound effects, they did the actual snogging.

00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:54.000
 Did they actually have sex?

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:55.000
 No, they didn't do that.

00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:57.000
 The actual sex, penetrative sex.

00:09:57.000 --> 00:09:58.000
 They're in the studio.

00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:07.000
 Okay, it is time for fact number two.

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:09.000
 And that is James.

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:12.000
 Okay, my fact this week is that a company in New York

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:15.000
 has invented coffee cups that grow on trees.

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:20.000
 So, yes, this is amazing.

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:23.000
 So, these are reusable cups that are made from goods,

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:26.000
 which are a plant, which is like pumpkins or marrows

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:27.000
 or something like that.

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:30.000
 And they're grown inside 3D printed molds.

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:34.000
 And so, they grow on a tree and you can literally pluck the cup off the tree

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:36.000
 and use it as a coffee cup immediately.

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:37.000
 Wow.

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:38.000
 It's absolutely amazing.

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:41.000
 And of course, the problem is that coffee cups are really bad to recycle,

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:43.000
 hardly anyone recycles them.

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:46.000
 So, this could be the future of recyclable coffee cups.

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:48.000
 I read that they got the idea from this

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:52.000
 from how the Japanese have been breeding watermelons

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:55.000
 because it's very hard to pack a watermelon in the shape that they are.

00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:59.000
 So, they've been breeding them to be rectangular shaped or box shaped.

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:02.000
 So, you can actually stack them now inside cargo ships

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:04.000
 and so on to get them out there.

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:06.000
 So, they've managed to do it on actual trees outside,

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:08.000
 but the problem is obviously you're going to have pests

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:10.000
 and the weather you never know what's going to happen.

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:12.000
 So, they've done it in a laboratory now.

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:15.000
 But they think that this genuinely could be a future thing.

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:17.000
 And obviously, they are 100% biodegradable.

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:18.000
 Oh, great.

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:19.000
 So, that's the main thing about them.

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:22.000
 Because the coffee cups that we get, they're made of paper,

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:24.000
 but they have polyethylene, I think, on the inside,

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:28.000
 which means that basically you can't recycle them at all.

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:29.000
 Yeah.

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:31.000
 Well, you can, but it's almost impossible.

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:33.000
 It's crazy. Here's a bit of a bummer of a fact.

00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:38.000
 Two point five billion coffee cups are thrown away each year.

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:42.000
 And 99.75% of those are not recycled.

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:44.000
 So, that's just in the UK.

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:46.000
 Fuck!

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:49.000
 And actually, those are 2011 figures,

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:52.000
 and it may be more like five billion a year by now.

00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:56.000
 And also, most of these cups are made from virgin paper pulp,

00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:58.000
 which means they've never been used for anything else.

00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:00.000
 They haven't been recycled from something else.

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:03.000
 So, a tree gets cut down, you turn it into a cup,

00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:05.000
 you drink half the coffee and throw the rest away,

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:07.000
 because it's cold, and that's the last time it ever gets used.

00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:09.000
 They last for 30 years.

00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:11.000
 I mean, time was already bummed out by this fact.

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:13.000
 You've now been at 70 times worse.

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:15.000
 Poor guy.

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:18.000
 But the future is, maybe, by the great of course.

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:19.000
 And trees.

00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:21.000
 Another thing that's obviously quite bad for the environment

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:24.000
 is bottles, and we chuck a lot of bottles away as well.

00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:27.000
 And other countries have this great system of bottle recycling,

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:30.000
 where you get kind of bottle anti-vending machines,

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:32.000
 where you put your plastic bottles in,

00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:34.000
 and you get money out.

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:36.000
 And so, Germany has this, for instance,

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:38.000
 and it's very clever, so you take an empty bottle

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:41.000
 to one of these machines, put it in, you get 25 cents.

00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:45.000
 And so, people have started gaming their system, as you would.

00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:49.000
 And a man in Germany, last year, was sentenced to 10 months in prison

00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:53.000
 after he installed a magnetic sensor within one of these machines,

00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:56.000
 and then there's kind of wooden tunnel that redirected the bottle.

00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:58.000
 So, usually the bottles are shredded when they go in,

00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:00.000
 so that you can't get hold of them again.

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:03.000
 He created a little wooden tunnel that redirected the bottle,

00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:09.000
 so it came straight back out again, and he got 44,362 euros

00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:15.000
 by inserting one bottle, 177,451 times.

00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:18.000
 I'm imagine being right behind him in the queue.

00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:22.000
 [laughter]

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:27.000
 He did say, "The judge actually said this was a logistical masterstroke,"

00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:30.000
 and said, "You must have done nothing else every day

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:33.000
 other than attending the machine, and he did reply.

00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:36.000
 I had a radio next to it because otherwise it was really boring."

00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:40.000
 [laughter]

00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:43.000
 I've been looking into coffee cups.

00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:47.000
 So, there's one, there has been invented, a self-stirring mug.

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:48.000
 That's cool.

00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:51.000
 So, it's got a propeller on the bottom that goes at 3,000 revolutions per minute.

00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:54.000
 [laughter]

00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:55.000
 No, no, no, no.

00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:59.000
 That's what it says. It's a small propeller, but nevertheless, it just stirs it.

00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:03.000
 So, you know, say goodbye to that sludgey hot chocolate misery.

00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:05.000
 Like 50 a second or something.

00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:07.000
 Yeah, it's fast, it's fast. I'm not saying it's fast.

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:10.000
 Say hello shortly to coffee spilled everywhere.

00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:12.000
 Yeah, how can you?

00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:14.000
 I don't know, I don't know how it stays in.

00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:19.000
 And there's another one which sort of heats up, and it's connected to an app.

00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:22.000
 So, it keeps your coffee at the same temperature all the time.

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:24.000
 But it's quite expensive, and it only lasts for it.

00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:26.000
 You have to reach out to the battery every hour.

00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:27.000
 Right.

00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:31.000
 And you need to use an app on your phone to set the temperature you want your drink to be at.

00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:33.000
 So, there are some cheating problems.

00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:35.000
 Yeah, you could just use a microwave, couldn't you?

00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:36.000
 I agree.

00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:38.000
 [laughter]

00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:41.000
 Can we talk about gourds?

00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:42.000
 Yes, please.

00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:44.000
 Gordds, I've not heard of, really.

00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:46.000
 I've seen, I know that there's...

00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:47.000
 You know what a pumpkin is.

00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:48.000
 I know what a pumpkin is.

00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:50.000
 Never heard of the word "gourd" up until researching this.

00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:53.000
 And it's one of the most fascinating things I've ever read about.

00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:54.000
 I have to say.

00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:57.000
 Did you want to say anything specific or just...

00:14:57.000 --> 00:15:00.000
 No, I just want to marvel in the beauty of it.

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:01.000
 No, they're incredible.

00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:05.000
 Gordds have been used for virtually everything throughout history.

00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:07.000
 They're one of the first domesticated things that we've...

00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:09.000
 Before we domesticated.

00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:10.000
 It's true.

00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:11.000
 It's true.

00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:15.000
 We had pet pumpkins before we had pet dogs.

00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:16.000
 Yeah.

00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:19.000
 You don't want to come up against a wild gourd, though.

00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:21.000
 Very dangerous.

00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:23.000
 You might get God.

00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:28.000
 [cheers and applause]

00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:30.000
 Very forgiving, Gordds.

00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:33.000
 That's how old they are.

00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:35.000
 That's the very first pun ever made.

00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:37.000
 Was your favourite use?

00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:42.000
 I really like when you see old Victorian people smoking pipes.

00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:43.000
 That's a gourd.

00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:47.000
 That's the top of a gourd that's been attached to the rest of a bit that sucks in.

00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:50.000
 But the bit that big Sherlock Holmes looking bit, that is a gourd.

00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:51.000
 Big Sherlock Holmes.

00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:53.000
 This is a sequel, wasn't it, too.

00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:54.000
 Sherlock Holmes.

00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:58.000
 A young Sherlock Holmes.

00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:00.000
 [laughter]

00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:03.000
 I love mentioning my dear Watson.

00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:05.000
 [laughter]

00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:07.000
 Holmes smash.

00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:09.000
 [laughter]

00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:12.000
 He's not clever, but he is strong.

00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:14.000
 [laughter]

00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:16.000
 You don't want to make him deduce.

00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:17.000
 [laughter]

00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:19.000
 Yeah, so Gordds are...

00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:20.000
 They have uses.

00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:22.000
 Yeah, they've got great uses.

00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:24.000
 Oh, that's my darling.

00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:27.000
 In China, they use them as cricket boxes.

00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:29.000
 Sorry, do you mean boxes to keep insects?

00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:30.000
 I do.

00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:33.000
 You don't mean cricket boxes that you would put over you.

00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:34.000
 No.

00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:36.000
 They use them to keep crickets.

00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:39.000
 It's quite a statement if you turn up with a massive gourd over your box

00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:40.000
 when you're playing cricket, isn't it?

00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:42.000
 It implies a certain spot.

00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:44.000
 That is a thing, isn't it penis gods?

00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:45.000
 Yeah.

00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:47.000
 In different places around the world.

00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:48.000
 I love the world.

00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:51.000
 They use it for a lot of like hunter-gatherers who don't wear clothes.

00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:54.000
 They would always cover their genitals with a god.

00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:55.000
 Yeah.

00:16:55.000 --> 00:16:57.000
 I think somewhere where they were...

00:16:57.000 --> 00:16:58.000
 Oh, still one, actually.

00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:01.000
 It's in Papua New Guinea, New Guinea, and they're called Cotaker.

00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:04.000
 And they're made of the Calabash, which is a type of gourd.

00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:07.000
 And you can identify different tribes by the way they wear their gourd.

00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:10.000
 So sometimes they'll be pointed straight outwards.

00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:12.000
 Sometimes they'll be straight up.

00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:15.000
 Sometimes they'll be at a specific angle and the direction of the penis.

00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:16.000
 Like a sundial.

00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:17.000
 It's like a sundial.

00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:18.000
 Yeah.

00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:19.000
 What do I...

00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:20.000
 Tell...

00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:21.000
 What time is it?

00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:23.000
 Let's just see Barry's penis course.

00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:24.000
 Oh, yeah.

00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:27.000
 It's not like the hand of a clock.

00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:29.000
 It just stays in the one place.

00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:30.000
 So is it...

00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:33.000
 But can you deduce things about the wearer from the way they're wearing it?

00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:34.000
 Yes.

00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:35.000
 I'd show our coms.

00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:39.000
 You can deduce whether they're working or playing.

00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:41.000
 If they're working, they'll wear smaller ones.

00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:42.000
 And then...

00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:43.000
 Really?

00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:44.000
 Oh, come on.

00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:47.000
 I mean, going to a party or a ceremony or something.

00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:52.000
 But what they do not use is bigger ones to show status or anything like that.

00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:54.000
 You'll wear one similar to your friends.

00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:57.000
 So if you're a part of a group, you'll all wear a certain type.

00:17:57.000 --> 00:17:59.000
 So we would all have the same type.

00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:01.000
 Oh, no.

00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:02.000
 Yeah.

00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:03.000
 Well, we're like, I'm from the north.

00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:06.000
 So I would have a slightly different penis gourd to you guys from the south.

00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:08.000
 Yours would have a whip it attached.

00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:16.000
 And apparently some of the gods are so capacious that travelers on long journeys

00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:18.000
 would keep cigarettes or money in them.

00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:19.000
 In their penis gourd?

00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:22.000
 Well, you don't have pockets to you if you're naked apart from a penis gourd.

00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:24.000
 No, it's a good place to keep it.

00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:27.000
 Which we didn't say, but they would usually be naked apart from penis gourd.

00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:29.000
 It is quite hot there. It's fine.

00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:34.000
 But this was thought to be a problematic thing in the 70s to the Indonesian government

00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:39.000
 who thought in 1971 to '72 the Indonesian government launched Operation penis gourd

00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:45.000
 which was they tried to encourage the locals in Papua New Guinea to wear shorts and shirts.

00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:48.000
 They didn't succeed because people didn't know how to wash their clothes

00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:50.000
 and they didn't really know how to wear them.

00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:53.000
 So there were people who went, missionaries who went and reported people

00:18:53.000 --> 00:18:57.000
 men wearing shorts as hats and women using the dresses as shoulder bags.

00:18:57.000 --> 00:18:59.000
 So it is bad.

00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:04.000
 And like also if you can't find a god, then you kind of improvise.

00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:10.000
 So people in the past would use coconuts or shells or leather or grass or something like that.

00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:13.000
 But in modern years they've been using toothpaste containers,

00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:17.000
 codec film cans and even sardine tins.

00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:19.000
 Wow.

00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:21.000
 Well, yeah.

00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:23.000
 It's not the only...

00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:29.000
 Everyone else was holding that laugh in them.

00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:33.000
 Those codec film tins are not very big, aren't they?

00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:38.000
 I don't know what your status is. If you turn up with one of those.

00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:41.000
 Well, let's see what develops.

00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:53.000
 In modern times, gods are used on the other head, the actual head.

00:19:53.000 --> 00:19:57.000
 That's what you call yours is the other head.

00:19:57.000 --> 00:20:04.000
 Yeah, I mean Nigeria, there was a law that was passed where all motorcyclists had to wear a helmet.

00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:07.000
 And unfortunately helmets are very expensive for a lot of people there.

00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:12.000
 So what they did was they cut a gourd out and you would wear the gourd as your helmet.

00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:16.000
 And it was not seen as a legal thing, but it was very effective.

00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:22.000
 Because they're amazingly sturdy. They're very wooden, the gourd.

00:20:22.000 --> 00:20:25.000
 You're making your own jokes now, guys.

00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:30.000
 Well, the main reason that they're so amazing is because they were used for carrying water and food and stuff like that.

00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:34.000
 And that's why we domesticated them tens of thousands of years ago.

00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:39.000
 Like that is cultivated. We didn't domesticate them.

00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:41.000
 We cultivated you domesticate crops.

00:20:41.000 --> 00:20:44.000
 They're not world animals.

00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:47.000
 In Hawaii, they had a game called Killu.

00:20:47.000 --> 00:20:52.000
 And what you did is you would cut the top off a gourd and then you would spin it and you would try and hit your opponent's killu.

00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:54.000
 A bit like Conkers, almost.

00:20:54.000 --> 00:20:57.000
 But it was taken really seriously.

00:20:57.000 --> 00:21:03.000
 If anyone disturbed the silence that was supposed to prevail during the course of a game, his clothing was set on fire.

00:21:03.000 --> 00:21:07.000
 Sorry, when you say his clothing, do you mean his single penis gourd?

00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:09.000
 That's all he's wearing.

00:21:09.000 --> 00:21:11.000
 This is in Hawaii where they were.

00:21:11.000 --> 00:21:13.000
 Oh, I'm sorry, okay.

00:21:13.000 --> 00:21:15.000
 That is harsh.

00:21:15.000 --> 00:21:18.000
 But it does apply here today, audience, so take note.

00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:20.000
 Should we move on to our next fact?

00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:24.000
 Okay, it is time for fact number three and that is Andy.

00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:29.000
 My fact is that the Mona Lisa effect is where a painting is looking directly at you.

00:21:29.000 --> 00:21:33.000
 That the Mona Lisa effect does not apply to the Mona Lisa.

00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:35.000
 She's not looking at you.

00:21:35.000 --> 00:21:37.000
 She's looking through you.

00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:41.000
 Isn't she looking just over your shoulder at someone more interested?

00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:42.000
 Yes.

00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:45.000
 And that's why she's so enigmatic and brilliant.

00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:48.000
 So this is the effect that's been known as that for years.

00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:54.000
 And then researchers at a German university, Bielefeld, they actually were studying directional gaze.

00:21:54.000 --> 00:21:56.000
 And they thought let's do an experiment on the Mona Lisa.

00:21:56.000 --> 00:22:00.000
 And they gave people images of the Mona Lisa on a screen and rulers.

00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:03.000
 And they said, can you just map where she's looking with the ruler?

00:22:03.000 --> 00:22:06.000
 And she's none of them thought that she was looking at that.

00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:11.000
 Yeah, and then if you look at it, actually, she is obviously just looking, looking a scant, isn't she?

00:22:11.000 --> 00:22:14.000
 She's giving side eye.

00:22:14.000 --> 00:22:15.000
 Yeah.

00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:16.000
 Amazing.

00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:18.000
 So the laughing cavalier is one of these things.

00:22:18.000 --> 00:22:21.000
 And actually, it's quite easy to do this kind of thing.

00:22:21.000 --> 00:22:24.000
 If you do any painting where someone's looking directly in front of them,

00:22:24.000 --> 00:22:27.000
 then that will have the effects of the eyes following you around the room.

00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:28.000
 Yeah.

00:22:28.000 --> 00:22:29.000
 Yeah.

00:22:29.000 --> 00:22:35.000
 It is undeniable that the Mona Lisa has a flickering enigmatic smile, though, isn't it?

00:22:35.000 --> 00:22:37.000
 Even though a lot's been made of it.

00:22:37.000 --> 00:22:39.000
 Because you look up the picture again when you're researching for this.

00:22:39.000 --> 00:22:41.000
 You're like, oh, yeah, that isn't an elusive smile.

00:22:41.000 --> 00:22:46.000
 But there has been a study done recently, which has given quite a convincing explanation

00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:49.000
 for how that enigmatic smile is achieved.

00:22:49.000 --> 00:22:50.000
 And it's really interesting.

00:22:50.000 --> 00:22:54.000
 So it's not about her eyes, it's about our eyes.

00:22:54.000 --> 00:22:57.000
 And what it is is that around her mouth, it's quite blurry.

00:22:57.000 --> 00:23:00.000
 So Da Vinci painted it quite blurry and quite shadowy.

00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:05.000
 And if you look at her eyes, then your peripheral vision is controlled by the rods

00:23:05.000 --> 00:23:07.000
 in the edge of your eyes.

00:23:07.000 --> 00:23:08.000
 So you've got rods and cones.

00:23:08.000 --> 00:23:09.000
 The rods are in the edge.

00:23:09.000 --> 00:23:13.000
 And they're much better at making out shadows and therefore night vision.

00:23:13.000 --> 00:23:16.000
 So when you're looking in the Mona Lisa's eyes, the mouth looks like it's smiling

00:23:16.000 --> 00:23:18.000
 because you see more of a blurry shadow there.

00:23:18.000 --> 00:23:21.000
 But as soon as you look down to the mouth, the smile vanishes.

00:23:21.000 --> 00:23:22.000
 And you can try it.

00:23:22.000 --> 00:23:25.000
 You look at the eyes, the smile is there, you stare at the mouth, it's gone.

00:23:25.000 --> 00:23:26.000
 It's very annoying.

00:23:26.000 --> 00:23:28.000
 You feel like she's flirting with you and then she doesn't give a shit.

00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:31.000
 But we all know that feeling.

00:23:31.000 --> 00:23:35.000
 There are so many theories about what causes the Mona Lisa's looks.

00:23:35.000 --> 00:23:36.000
 They're crazy.

00:23:36.000 --> 00:23:38.000
 And they're not very flattering to her either.

00:23:38.000 --> 00:23:40.000
 So there are all these interesting features.

00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:43.000
 So one theory is she's got slightly yellowed skin.

00:23:43.000 --> 00:23:46.000
 And rather than just that being the age of the painting, some doctors said,

00:23:46.000 --> 00:23:49.000
 "Oh, she's got a thyroid problem."

00:23:49.000 --> 00:23:51.000
 And she's got psychomotor retardation and muscle weakness,

00:23:51.000 --> 00:23:53.000
 leading to a less than fully blossom smile.

00:23:53.000 --> 00:23:57.000
 Another theory is she had a goiter in her neck, sort of swelling,

00:23:57.000 --> 00:23:59.000
 due to a lack of iodine.

00:23:59.000 --> 00:24:01.000
 She's got heart disease, said someone else.

00:24:01.000 --> 00:24:05.000
 Another person said she's smiling because she's got enormously high cholesterol.

00:24:05.000 --> 00:24:07.000
 Does that make people smile?

00:24:07.000 --> 00:24:08.000
 Not really.

00:24:08.000 --> 00:24:13.000
 So the cholesterol thing, I think she has slightly fatty eyes

00:24:13.000 --> 00:24:16.000
 and they think that maybe that's it's not for the smile of the fatty acid.

00:24:16.000 --> 00:24:19.000
 She's smiling with her eyes because of high cholesterol.

00:24:19.000 --> 00:24:22.000
 There is a theory that she's got syphilis.

00:24:22.000 --> 00:24:26.000
 So this is really interesting because we know about the woman who was in the...

00:24:26.000 --> 00:24:29.000
 who was the subject, who was the model for it.

00:24:29.000 --> 00:24:31.000
 She was called Lisa Del Jocondo.

00:24:31.000 --> 00:24:35.000
 And we know a little bit about her spending records, her the actual woman.

00:24:35.000 --> 00:24:39.000
 So for example, we know that she bought in August 15,

00:24:39.000 --> 00:24:44.000
 seven lira of medicinal snail water from the nuns at St. Osseller.

00:24:44.000 --> 00:24:49.000
 And so snail water was a treatment for sexually transmitted diseases.

00:24:49.000 --> 00:24:54.000
 However, also she did buy it 10 years after the painting was actually painted.

00:24:54.000 --> 00:24:56.000
 So we've had to be in especially...

00:24:56.000 --> 00:24:58.000
 Yeah, but we've all had the thing where we feel a bit sick,

00:24:58.000 --> 00:25:00.000
 we put off going to the doctor.

00:25:00.000 --> 00:25:03.000
 So I guess you put it off for 10, 15 years.

00:25:03.000 --> 00:25:05.000
 And she finally went on a guy with snail water.

00:25:05.000 --> 00:25:10.000
 I didn't realize that she's painted on a wooden board, not on canvas.

00:25:10.000 --> 00:25:11.000
 I had no idea.

00:25:11.000 --> 00:25:13.000
 Oh, she did not know that.

00:25:13.000 --> 00:25:14.000
 Did you know it?

00:25:14.000 --> 00:25:15.000
 Yeah, it's not a canvas.

00:25:15.000 --> 00:25:17.000
 That is a plank of wood that she was painted on.

00:25:17.000 --> 00:25:18.000
 Yeah.

00:25:18.000 --> 00:25:19.000
 Wow, cool.

00:25:19.000 --> 00:25:20.000
 Yeah.

00:25:20.000 --> 00:25:23.000
 I am just on the weird stuff that's attributed to her.

00:25:23.000 --> 00:25:27.000
 There was a headline in Discover Magazine, which was really the epitome of...

00:25:27.000 --> 00:25:31.000
 There's a word for headlines that ask questions and the answer is always no.

00:25:31.000 --> 00:25:35.000
 The Betteridge Law or something.

00:25:35.000 --> 00:25:43.000
 The Discover Magazine headline was "Was Mona Lisa's smile caused by Bell's pausie or a punch in the face?"

00:25:43.000 --> 00:25:46.000
 The answer is neither.

00:25:46.000 --> 00:25:51.000
 But yeah, there was a theory that it might have been Bell's pausie where the facial nerve has undergone a bit of degeneration.

00:25:51.000 --> 00:25:53.000
 So it looks a bit limp.

00:25:53.000 --> 00:25:57.000
 Or as someone thinks that this is an academic study that was done

00:25:57.000 --> 00:26:01.000
 that says that a close-up shows a scar suggesting the application of blunt force

00:26:01.000 --> 00:26:06.000
 and also there are changes in the periol area that occur when the anterior teeth are lost

00:26:06.000 --> 00:26:10.000
 and a scar on her lower lip suggests that a teeth of pierce to her face.

00:26:10.000 --> 00:26:13.000
 So what you're looking at is someone who's been in a huge fight.

00:26:13.000 --> 00:26:17.000
 Sent for big Sherlock Holmes.

00:26:17.000 --> 00:26:24.000
 I think we might have said before that Mona Lisa wasn't all that popular until it got stolen.

00:26:24.000 --> 00:26:30.000
 And then it got stolen and then it was a big cause celebra and they became really famous after that.

00:26:30.000 --> 00:26:35.000
 When it was stolen from the Louvre in 1911, the number of visitors to the gallery actually rose

00:26:35.000 --> 00:26:39.000
 and people just went to look at the blank space in the wall where it had been.

00:26:39.000 --> 00:26:43.000
 And it was the first time anyone had ever had to queue to get into the Louvre

00:26:43.000 --> 00:26:49.000
 and that year 1911 was a record year for the gallery and all because people just wanted to see where it used to be.

00:26:49.000 --> 00:26:54.000
 Wow! Isn't that amazing? They just steal it again from themselves.

00:26:54.000 --> 00:27:01.000
 Well, it kind of was stolen by themselves from themselves because it was a guy who was working for the Louvre who stole it.

00:27:01.000 --> 00:27:05.000
 So there had been a threatening letter the year before I can't do what it said.

00:27:05.000 --> 00:27:11.000
 I'm going to steal your paintings or something, but Louvre officials had then hired a glazier's firm

00:27:11.000 --> 00:27:16.000
 to put dozens of the paintings under glass and one of the people working for the glazier's firm

00:27:16.000 --> 00:27:24.000
 Vincent Vincenzo Perugia, an Italian man, he was annoyed because the French always insulted him.

00:27:24.000 --> 00:27:30.000
 They called him things like macaroni eater and I know, other slam and insults.

00:27:30.000 --> 00:27:34.000
 And he stole it. He walked out with his under his coat.

00:27:34.000 --> 00:27:37.000
 Well, he thought that the painting had been stolen from Italy, didn't he?

00:27:37.000 --> 00:27:41.000
 Yes. So that's why he thought he wanted to bring it back to his own land.

00:27:41.000 --> 00:27:48.000
 Right. And there is a theory that during the two years that he had it, he made a copy of it and then he gave back the copy to the Louvre

00:27:48.000 --> 00:27:51.000
 and then he's still got the original or someone has still had the original.

00:27:51.000 --> 00:27:53.000
 He's still aged 180.

00:27:53.000 --> 00:28:00.000
 There was another theory that, and I think this has been discounted at this point, but he was asked to steal it

00:28:00.000 --> 00:28:06.000
 by someone else who planned to make a lot of money off it and they made six copies which they shipped around the world.

00:28:06.000 --> 00:28:12.000
 So, shipped it at a time when it would not have been suspicious and he never wanted the actual Mona Lisa.

00:28:12.000 --> 00:28:19.000
 What he wanted was for it to go missing so that he could then sell to private buyers these six who would never admit to owning it.

00:28:19.000 --> 00:28:25.000
 And that's the plot of what the most highly rated Doctor Who episode of All Time, City of Death.

00:28:25.000 --> 00:28:28.000
 There you go. So that's facts there, right there.

00:28:28.000 --> 00:28:33.000
 People have been obsessed for a long time, even though it generated a lot of publicity, the 1911 thing.

00:28:33.000 --> 00:28:40.000
 Napoleon, for instance, was enough with the painting and almost when the moment it was painted, Leonardo da Vinci knew it was a big deal.

00:28:40.000 --> 00:28:45.000
 He spent something ridiculous like 15 years working on it and after his death was massively critiqued.

00:28:45.000 --> 00:28:50.000
 And then in 1800 Napoleon took it and hung it on his bedroom wall for a few years.

00:28:50.000 --> 00:28:54.000
 Which I find very weird, the idea that he was there looking at it for a few years.

00:28:54.000 --> 00:29:02.000
 I believe that he dated a woman, an Italian woman called Teresa Guadagne, who was the descendant of the real life Mona Lisa.

00:29:02.000 --> 00:29:04.000
 You know where?

00:29:04.000 --> 00:29:07.000
 Imagine someone taking you back to their place.

00:29:07.000 --> 00:29:13.000
 They take you onto their room and you're great, great, great, great, great, great grandmother's on the wall.

00:29:13.000 --> 00:29:17.000
 You have a type.

00:29:17.000 --> 00:29:20.000
 We're going to have to move on very shortly.

00:29:20.000 --> 00:29:24.000
 Just some things about other effects that paintings have on people.

00:29:24.000 --> 00:29:25.000
 Oh yeah.

00:29:25.000 --> 00:29:27.000
 The weird effects paintings have.

00:29:27.000 --> 00:29:39.000
 So in 2007, there was a 32-year-old woman called Rindy Sam who was wearing lipstick when she kissed a painting by the American artist Sy Twombley.

00:29:39.000 --> 00:29:41.000
 And she left this big red smudge.

00:29:41.000 --> 00:29:43.000
 And so he was a very famous modern artist.

00:29:43.000 --> 00:29:44.000
 She kissed this painting.

00:29:44.000 --> 00:29:51.000
 Left this red smudge and she went to court and she explained when I kissed it, I thought the artist would have understood I was overcome with passion.

00:29:51.000 --> 00:29:55.000
 And the court disagreed and she was sentenced to attend a course on good citizenship.

00:29:55.000 --> 00:29:57.000
 Oh wow.

00:29:57.000 --> 00:30:04.000
 Also in America, Martha Rothko, his paintings are said to be such a confrontation of emotion.

00:30:04.000 --> 00:30:06.000
 And this is particularly...

00:30:06.000 --> 00:30:08.000
 He's the one who does the big blocks of colour.

00:30:08.000 --> 00:30:10.000
 Yeah, the ones you can buy in IKEA.

00:30:10.000 --> 00:30:11.000
 Yeah.

00:30:11.000 --> 00:30:13.000
 I can't go in in IKEA anymore.

00:30:13.000 --> 00:30:16.000
 I get to overcome by emotion whenever I go in.

00:30:16.000 --> 00:30:24.000
 He has, in Texas, the Rothko Chapel, which has a lot of his paintings and outside of the security guards that they have there.

00:30:24.000 --> 00:30:29.000
 They also have on standby counselors who can comfort you if the emotions become way too much.

00:30:29.000 --> 00:30:31.000
 And you need to talk about it.

00:30:31.000 --> 00:30:32.000
 Wow.

00:30:32.000 --> 00:30:34.000
 That is an easy job, my bet.

00:30:34.000 --> 00:30:37.000
 So it's the guy who just paints big rectangles.

00:30:37.000 --> 00:30:38.000
 Yeah.

00:30:38.000 --> 00:30:41.000
 And Andy will be appearing on BBC 4 in his new series.

00:30:41.000 --> 00:30:44.000
 Modern art with Andrew Hunterbury.

00:30:44.000 --> 00:30:46.000
 Just a fucking block.

00:30:46.000 --> 00:31:00.000
 All right, we need to move on to our final fact of the show and that is Chuzinsky.

00:31:00.000 --> 00:31:07.000
 Yes, my fact this week is that in ancient Rome there was a job which was to deal with infected earlobes.

00:31:07.000 --> 00:31:13.000
 And this was specifically because people were really into earrings in ancient Rome.

00:31:13.000 --> 00:31:20.000
 And they had big, heavy earrings that sort of, you know, well actually any of us who had our ears pierced they get infected at some point.

00:31:20.000 --> 00:31:21.000
 And so there was a job.

00:31:21.000 --> 00:31:23.000
 It was always a woman who did it.

00:31:23.000 --> 00:31:26.000
 They were called the curricula on matrix.

00:31:26.000 --> 00:31:29.000
 And she would deal with the infected lobes.

00:31:29.000 --> 00:31:33.000
 Or she would also, so either she would work in a salon.

00:31:33.000 --> 00:31:39.000
 So there were a few sources which described them working in the hairdressers and the man would do the barbering, the manly barbering.

00:31:39.000 --> 00:31:42.000
 And the curricula on matrix would do the earlobeing.

00:31:42.000 --> 00:31:48.000
 Or they would be employed as slaves and a household where their specific and only job was to look after their mistresses ears.

00:31:48.000 --> 00:31:53.000
 And you know, take care of their earrings, put earrings into their ears when they needed to be put in.

00:31:53.000 --> 00:31:55.000
 Take them out when they need to know that.

00:31:55.000 --> 00:31:57.000
 That's an easy job, isn't it?

00:31:57.000 --> 00:31:58.000
 That's a pretty easy job.

00:31:58.000 --> 00:32:03.000
 Very much the Mark Rothko Texas Chapel psychiatrist attended of its day, yeah.

00:32:03.000 --> 00:32:05.000
 Barbers were weird as well, actually.

00:32:05.000 --> 00:32:08.000
 Barbers in ancient Rome had various other jobs.

00:32:08.000 --> 00:32:11.000
 So first of all, being a barber was quite different to today.

00:32:11.000 --> 00:32:17.000
 So treatments for hair involved applying things like decomposed leeches, not leeches, rotting leeches.

00:32:17.000 --> 00:32:19.000
 You're in and pigeon droppings to your head.

00:32:19.000 --> 00:32:21.000
 So if you went to get a haircut, that's what you got.

00:32:21.000 --> 00:32:23.000
 And they also performed teeth extraction.

00:32:23.000 --> 00:32:24.000
 Did I just know?

00:32:24.000 --> 00:32:34.000
 It's not like there's the old thing about, I don't know if this is true, but the old thing about the pole for a barber's being white and red is because they did a lot of surgery as well.

00:32:34.000 --> 00:32:38.000
 It is, they did bloodletting, but that was actually the new and improved sign for a barber's.

00:32:38.000 --> 00:32:41.000
 Because before that, the sign was a bowl of blood.

00:32:41.000 --> 00:32:47.000
 And at some point, I think authorities got involved and they said, maybe the balls of blood are going a bit off.

00:32:47.000 --> 00:32:49.000
 Could you replace the balls of blood?

00:32:49.000 --> 00:33:02.000
 And actually about the decomposed leeches, according to Pliny, the best way to get black hair coloring is to apply leeches that have been rotten in red wine for 40 days.

00:33:02.000 --> 00:33:05.000
 And with the juice of that, apply it to the hair.

00:33:05.000 --> 00:33:10.000
 So you have to put it in the red wine for 30 days, presumably drink the wine afterwards because it's waste not one block.

00:33:10.000 --> 00:33:12.000
 And then you put the little bit in your head.

00:33:12.000 --> 00:33:14.000
 Any product today, sir?

00:33:16.000 --> 00:33:20.000
 Just another quite weird job that there used to be in ancient Rome.

00:33:20.000 --> 00:33:22.000
 There was the urine tax collector.

00:33:22.000 --> 00:33:23.000
 Wow.

00:33:23.000 --> 00:33:26.000
 Collected tanks in urine or taxed you every time you eat.

00:33:26.000 --> 00:33:28.000
 Both are equally ridiculous.

00:33:28.000 --> 00:33:29.000
 Exactly. No, it was.

00:33:29.000 --> 00:33:31.000
 This was for the batting houses.

00:33:31.000 --> 00:33:34.000
 If the toilets were there, they would overflow with urine.

00:33:34.000 --> 00:33:36.000
 They would have to be taken away.

00:33:36.000 --> 00:33:42.000
 But the urine was very necessary for a lot of chemical products at the time, as you were mentioning with the leeches, might be used there.

00:33:42.000 --> 00:33:46.000
 So many things, mouthwash in ancient urine.

00:33:46.000 --> 00:33:50.000
 That was another time, ancient urine.

00:33:50.000 --> 00:33:54.000
 In ancient Rome, mouthwash was urine.

00:33:54.000 --> 00:33:58.000
 You'd go with some urine and that would theory clean your teeth.

00:33:58.000 --> 00:33:59.000
 Would you?

00:33:59.000 --> 00:34:03.000
 Well, I wouldn't, but if I was in ancient Rome, yeah.

00:34:03.000 --> 00:34:05.000
 Wait, so they collected a urine tax?

00:34:05.000 --> 00:34:09.000
 They collected from the people who were purchasing the urine that was taken from the collective pool.

00:34:09.000 --> 00:34:13.000
 For your mouthwash. I can make mouthwash.

00:34:13.000 --> 00:34:21.000
 I imagine, I have read that about mouthwash, but I reckon mostly for dying, bleaching things.

00:34:21.000 --> 00:34:22.000
 Yes.

00:34:22.000 --> 00:34:24.000
 So bleaching hair, you could bleach that with urine.

00:34:24.000 --> 00:34:26.000
 You could tan leather with urine.

00:34:26.000 --> 00:34:27.000
 Lots of things you could do with it.

00:34:27.000 --> 00:34:28.000
 You could wash clothes, maybe?

00:34:28.000 --> 00:34:35.000
 Yeah, they'd stop of being a fuller, where you had to stand in a big tub full of dirty clothes and urine and stamp and just stamp on them.

00:34:35.000 --> 00:34:43.000
 Fun. Yeah. That makes more sense, because I do think that if you are using mouthwash more than your urinating, then you've got a problem.

00:34:43.000 --> 00:34:46.000
 One end or the other, have a clue.

00:34:46.000 --> 00:34:51.000
 Okay, so my job, should we do some more jobs?

00:34:51.000 --> 00:34:53.000
 Yeah, sure, yeah.

00:34:53.000 --> 00:34:57.000
 There was a job in the ancient Rome called The Fist You Later.

00:34:57.000 --> 00:34:59.000
 What?

00:34:59.000 --> 00:35:04.000
 I can't do it now, darling. I'm sorry, but I will do it later.

00:35:04.000 --> 00:35:06.000
 It's like an I.O.U.

00:35:06.000 --> 00:35:10.000
 A Fist You Later was someone who played a flute.

00:35:10.000 --> 00:35:22.000
 And there was a very particular guy called Gaius Grakis, or Gretius, and he was an orator, but he always wanted his oration, his speeches to be at a certain pitch.

00:35:22.000 --> 00:35:33.000
 And according to Cicero, he had this guy who was a flottist, who was playing the flute, and he would play the pitch so that whenever he spoke, he was always, he was never too high and never too low.

00:35:33.000 --> 00:35:45.000
 I read that guy, specifically that guy, would blow a note if he was overexerting himself too much, or speaking with real strained efforts, who might damage his voice.

00:35:45.000 --> 00:35:49.000
 So just to kind of turn it down.

00:35:49.000 --> 00:35:55.000
 I mean, I say it's a job, Cicero said it happened to one guy.

00:35:55.000 --> 00:36:09.000
 That sounds like a flute, sounds legit. A lot of the information we have on the weird jobs in Ancient Rome seem to come from this guy called Jan Gruter, who doesn't seem to be reference at all anymore, but he was this late 16th century Flemish scholar.

00:36:09.000 --> 00:36:13.000
 He was a son of a guy called Wouter Gruter.

00:36:13.000 --> 00:36:24.000
 He published all these volumes of inscriptions, which I just think is good to note, there were guys who went around looking at all the bits of Latin.

00:36:24.000 --> 00:36:30.000
 On bits of stone, all over the empire, and piece them together and working out what jobs existed.

00:36:30.000 --> 00:36:36.000
 But for instance, I think it was him who wrote about in the columbarium of freedmen of Livia.

00:36:36.000 --> 00:36:40.000
 So this is a place where all the slaves of Livia were buried.

00:36:40.000 --> 00:36:43.000
 So Livia was the evil woman from my Claudius, if you've read that.

00:36:43.000 --> 00:36:48.000
 And there were 600 slaves that she had all buried there.

00:36:48.000 --> 00:36:56.000
 And she had slaves, for instance, that were labeled as keeper of the armchair, specifically keeper of the family portraits was one whole job.

00:36:56.000 --> 00:37:01.000
 And the Cura Catelli, which is caretaker of the lap dog.

00:37:01.000 --> 00:37:03.000
 Full job.

00:37:03.000 --> 00:37:11.000
 There was also an ombrelythera, which is mentioned in Asian text, which is literally an ombrella carrier.

00:37:11.000 --> 00:37:22.000
 I also found that amazing etymologically that could is a thing today, a word has come completely wholesale.

00:37:22.000 --> 00:37:25.000
 And also it would mean shade, ombre means shade, isn't it?

00:37:25.000 --> 00:37:26.000
 Yes.

00:37:26.000 --> 00:37:29.000
 So if you're in the sunshine, they would cover you so that you weren't being sunburnt or...

00:37:29.000 --> 00:37:31.000
 Carry the thing that will shade you.

00:37:31.000 --> 00:37:35.000
 Yeah, so it's more like a sombrera carrier, I guess.

00:37:35.000 --> 00:37:37.000
 And a flabby leffer.

00:37:37.000 --> 00:37:40.000
 A flabby liffer, sorry, a fan bearer.

00:37:40.000 --> 00:37:43.000
 A flabby... oh, a fan bearer.

00:37:43.000 --> 00:37:47.000
 No, I've confused my fan bearer and my fan bearer.

00:37:47.000 --> 00:37:49.000
 Oh, I'm too small.

00:37:49.000 --> 00:37:52.000
 Back in you in the face with a peach.

00:37:52.000 --> 00:37:55.000
 It was the orgy planner.

00:37:55.000 --> 00:37:57.000
 That's a cool job.

00:37:57.000 --> 00:37:58.000
 Yeah?

00:37:58.000 --> 00:37:59.000
 Well, yeah.

00:37:59.000 --> 00:38:01.000
 What did they do? They just got people in or...

00:38:01.000 --> 00:38:02.000
 You.

00:38:02.000 --> 00:38:03.000
 In.

00:38:03.000 --> 00:38:05.000
 Out.

00:38:05.000 --> 00:38:06.000
 Out.

00:38:06.000 --> 00:38:12.000
 Shake it all about, I guess.

00:38:12.000 --> 00:38:13.000
 Right.

00:38:13.000 --> 00:38:15.000
 It's what it says on the tin, basically.

00:38:15.000 --> 00:38:17.000
 It was organising the parties.

00:38:17.000 --> 00:38:21.000
 And it was by someone who wasn't quite fit, let's say, socially,

00:38:21.000 --> 00:38:22.000
 to be a part of the orgy.

00:38:22.000 --> 00:38:28.000
 But the rank became such an important role that you would then be invited to the orgy as well.

00:38:28.000 --> 00:38:30.000
 If you'd organised it.

00:38:30.000 --> 00:38:31.000
 Okay, all right.

00:38:31.000 --> 00:38:37.000
 And often you'd be a slave of the person who then... I guess it was like being a PA, wasn't it?

00:38:37.000 --> 00:38:38.000
 You're their slave.

00:38:38.000 --> 00:38:42.000
 And you'd do various things like book their dry cleaning and also you plan their orgy.

00:38:42.000 --> 00:38:46.000
 Probably quite a lot of dry cleaning after that.

00:38:46.000 --> 00:38:48.000
 Okay, that's it. That is all of our facts.

00:38:48.000 --> 00:38:49.000
