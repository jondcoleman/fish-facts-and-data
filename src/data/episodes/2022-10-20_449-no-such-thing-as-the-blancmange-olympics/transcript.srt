1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,580
 (upbeat music)

2
00:00:02,580 --> 00:00:17,220
 - Hello, and welcome to another episode

3
00:00:17,220 --> 00:00:20,220
 of No Such Thing as a Fish, a weekly podcast

4
00:00:20,220 --> 00:00:23,300
 coming to you from the QI offices in Covent Garden.

5
00:00:23,300 --> 00:00:24,620
 My name is Dan Schreiber.

6
00:00:24,620 --> 00:00:27,900
 I'm sitting here with Anna Tyshinski, Andrew Hunter Murray,

7
00:00:27,900 --> 00:00:29,860
 and James Harkin, and once again,

8
00:00:29,860 --> 00:00:31,440
 we have gathered around the microphones

9
00:00:31,440 --> 00:00:34,400
 with our four favorite facts from the last seven days,

10
00:00:34,400 --> 00:00:37,720
 and in no particular order, here we go.

11
00:00:37,720 --> 00:00:41,320
 Starting with fact number one, and that is Andy.

12
00:00:41,320 --> 00:00:43,640
 - My fact is that one traditional Irish recipe

13
00:00:43,640 --> 00:00:46,280
 for Blemange involves moss.

14
00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:47,120
 - Here we go.

15
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:52,120
 - So, this is a cool fact about an old Irish pudding,

16
00:00:52,120 --> 00:00:53,840
 and it's--

17
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:55,680
 - That's what they say if you have to say it's cool.

18
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:56,840
 - Yeah, they have to tell the listener.

19
00:00:56,840 --> 00:00:59,080
 - It's interesting, and it's cool.

20
00:00:59,080 --> 00:01:01,120
 And it's actually from a hack-eye magazine,

21
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:02,160
 which I know you read--

22
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:03,000
 - That's Anna, isn't it?

23
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:03,840
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah, sort of.

24
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:04,680
 - You stole my 19.

25
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:05,500
 - I know, I'm on your turf already.

26
00:01:05,500 --> 00:01:07,400
 But basically, there is this pudding,

27
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:12,040
 and it's made from a thing called dried carrageen.

28
00:01:12,040 --> 00:01:14,680
 Okay, now, it's called moss, it's called Irish moss,

29
00:01:14,680 --> 00:01:17,040
 it's not actually moss, it's a kind of algae,

30
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:19,760
 and it's brown and crusty stuff

31
00:01:19,760 --> 00:01:21,560
 when you take it out of the water, you dry out.

32
00:01:21,560 --> 00:01:22,400
 - Sounds delicious.

33
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:24,360
 (laughing)

34
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:27,320
 - You have to boil it in milk for 20 minutes.

35
00:01:27,320 --> 00:01:28,160
 - Okay.

36
00:01:28,160 --> 00:01:29,280
 - And the thing is, when you boil it in milk,

37
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:31,240
 it vomits out this huge--

38
00:01:31,240 --> 00:01:33,400
 - Sounds absolutely delicious.

39
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:36,000
 - You thought we were having your own cookery show.

40
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,000
 You were next in my jello.

41
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:40,280
 - It sort of vomits out this jelly stuff.

42
00:01:40,280 --> 00:01:41,120
 - Yeah.

43
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:43,560
 - And you add the sugar and vanilla

44
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:45,920
 to make it slightly sweet, and you whisk it all up,

45
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:46,920
 and then you let it chill a bit.

46
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:50,640
 - I just love just going off the jello analogy,

47
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:53,080
 the way that you really, when you said vomiting up,

48
00:01:53,080 --> 00:01:55,600
 you said it a few times, and you really stressed it.

49
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:56,720
 And then when you got to the nice bit

50
00:01:56,720 --> 00:01:58,160
 of adding some vanilla and sugar,

51
00:01:58,160 --> 00:01:59,800
 you were like, "Oh yeah, we'll just gloss over that."

52
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:00,640
 That's fine.

53
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:03,280
 - Yeah, and then you've got your moss blommage.

54
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:06,400
 - And it apparently, it's quite crap, isn't it?

55
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:08,360
 - Well, what's bad about it?

56
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:09,760
 - I just think it's extremely bland,

57
00:02:09,760 --> 00:02:11,520
 but I think it's good if you add a little bit.

58
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:13,080
 - It doesn't really taste of any,

59
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:15,160
 some people say it tastes of the sea.

60
00:02:15,160 --> 00:02:16,000
 - Yes.

61
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,080
 - But actually, I think it just tastes really bland.

62
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:20,280
 And they used to give it to sick people, didn't they?

63
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:21,560
 If you were ill and infirm,

64
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:23,560
 you might get some of this pudding.

65
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:26,440
 It's in a 19th century handbook of invalid cooking

66
00:02:26,440 --> 00:02:29,200
 by Murray Boland, that's one of the early recipes.

67
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:30,040
 - Okay, right.

68
00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:31,680
 - And other recipes in that book,

69
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:35,200
 oatmeal mush, delicious, scraped beef.

70
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:36,760
 - Scraped beef.

71
00:02:36,760 --> 00:02:40,040
 - Milk lemonade, which just sounds disgusting to me.

72
00:02:40,040 --> 00:02:42,960
 Apart from it contains sherry, milk lemonade.

73
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:44,960
 And restorative jelly.

74
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:47,400
 And the restorative part of that is it has port in it.

75
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:48,240
 - Oh, okay, nice.

76
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:49,720
 - Like alko jelly kind of thing.

77
00:02:49,720 --> 00:02:51,800
 - I wish we were doing hello fresh ads in this period,

78
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:54,800
 where these were the recipes that we were advertising.

79
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:56,320
 - This algae, this seaweed,

80
00:02:56,320 --> 00:02:57,360
 how do you pronounce it again, Andy?

81
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:58,280
 - I said carrageen.

82
00:02:58,280 --> 00:02:59,720
 - Carrageen, yeah.

83
00:02:59,720 --> 00:03:02,040
 This is one of those stealth things that's in our life

84
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:04,400
 in so many different ways that we don't quite recognize.

85
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:06,480
 So if you look at the back of the ingredients list

86
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:07,800
 on many of the things in your house,

87
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:09,280
 you're gonna find this as one of the elements.

88
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:11,360
 So it's in things like toothpaste.

89
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:13,640
 It's in shampoo and cosmetics.

90
00:03:13,640 --> 00:03:16,000
 Firefighters use it to get a better foam

91
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,520
 when they're fighting fires.

92
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:18,480
 It's part of that.

93
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:19,880
 Yeah, it's used in that.

94
00:03:19,880 --> 00:03:23,040
 It's used in personal lubricants.

95
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:25,440
 Check your ingredients at home.

96
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:26,280
 But it's everywhere.

97
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:27,320
 Shoe polish everywhere.

98
00:03:27,320 --> 00:03:28,160
 - Laxatives.

99
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:29,280
 - Laxatives, yeah.

100
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:30,920
 - Helps those slide out.

101
00:03:30,920 --> 00:03:33,360
 It seems to be a couch.

102
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:35,080
 - It's good for helping things slide out.

103
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:36,600
 - Yeah, yeah.

104
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:38,560
 But it's very controversial.

105
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:40,520
 Did you guys read about the rabid controversy

106
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:41,800
 surrounding carrageen?

107
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:43,760
 Well--

108
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:45,640
 - Is this athletes?

109
00:03:45,640 --> 00:03:46,800
 - Oh, it's not, maybe there are two.

110
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:47,880
 - Oh no, okay, okay.

111
00:03:47,880 --> 00:03:50,040
 - Oh my God, okay, let's compare controversies.

112
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:53,240
 This is just that it could be very bad for you

113
00:03:53,240 --> 00:03:55,080
 and cause deadly diseases.

114
00:03:55,080 --> 00:03:56,120
 It doesn't.

115
00:03:56,120 --> 00:03:56,960
 But--

116
00:03:56,960 --> 00:03:57,800
 - What?

117
00:03:57,800 --> 00:04:00,080
 - Yeah, there was a roller coaster.

118
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:03,560
 - 'Cause it was a very much a one dip roller coaster.

119
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:06,840
 - This is a rumour that goes around in health circles

120
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:09,280
 about carrageenan, which is like the extract

121
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:10,800
 from the seaweed and carrageenan.

122
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:11,880
 - Ultra concentrated.

123
00:04:11,880 --> 00:04:12,720
 - Essence.

124
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:15,080
 - Yes, and that is used, as we've said,

125
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:15,920
 in lots of thicknesses.

126
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:18,400
 It's also in ice cream, cottage cheese, soy milk,

127
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:19,360
 things like that.

128
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:22,920
 And there was a academic called Joanne Tabakman,

129
00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:25,040
 who I think is still going campaigning against it,

130
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:28,880
 who said a few years ago that it caused all sorts of

131
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:31,560
 cancers, Parkinson's, heart disease, things like that.

132
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:34,600
 She was actually looking at a different thing.

133
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:36,680
 So it turned out someone looked into the study

134
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:39,400
 and she was looking at something that was called like--

135
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:40,480
 - Gamma radiation.

136
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:44,560
 - Yeah, a slightly different kind of seaweed.

137
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:47,560
 But it's great, and if you go on any health website,

138
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:49,920
 it's like avoid carrageen, it will give you cancer,

139
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:51,480
 it'll give you heart attacks, it'll give you--

140
00:04:51,480 --> 00:04:52,960
 So don't believe it.

141
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:54,800
 - It's almost carcinogen.

142
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:56,560
 Like the word is very similar, isn't it?

143
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:57,400
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

144
00:04:57,400 --> 00:04:58,240
 - Maybe that's what she studied.

145
00:04:58,240 --> 00:04:59,640
 She looked at carcinogens and said,

146
00:04:59,640 --> 00:05:00,800
 "Well, these all cause cancer."

147
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:03,720
 - Next to each other in the dictionary.

148
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:05,240
 - Its latter name is really fun.

149
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:06,920
 It's called Chondus Crispus.

150
00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:07,760
 - Ah!

151
00:05:07,760 --> 00:05:09,400
 - It's just a nice-- - Chondus Crispus.

152
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:10,240
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

153
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:12,840
 - I'd like to hear about the sport in controversy,

154
00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:14,760
 and I'd like to have a guess of what it might be,

155
00:05:14,760 --> 00:05:17,360
 'cause it's like a slippery thing, right?

156
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:19,760
 So maybe they attach it to toboggan's

157
00:05:19,760 --> 00:05:22,760
 when you do bobsled, and it makes you fly down the bobsled.

158
00:05:22,760 --> 00:05:24,720
 - That's correct, that's absolutely right.

159
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:26,040
 (laughing)

160
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:27,680
 - Or, here's another version.

161
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:31,000
 They put a load of it in the swimming pool,

162
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,480
 and it thickens up the water,

163
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:35,520
 and it means that you can just run across the water

164
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:36,360
 in a swimming race.

165
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:37,480
 - That would help everyone though.

166
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:39,080
 You have to put it in one lane.

167
00:05:39,080 --> 00:05:40,520
 (laughing)

168
00:05:40,520 --> 00:05:42,640
 One lane, someone doing the 50 meters.

169
00:05:42,640 --> 00:05:44,360
 - Yeah, okay.

170
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:46,000
 - Or you could do it in your opponent's lane,

171
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,240
 and so it slows them down.

172
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:49,400
 - I'd also like a quarter swimming through the big pool.

173
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:50,600
 - I think you have to have a lot of caragine

174
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:52,400
 to turn water into a solid.

175
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:54,680
 - Imagine the Olympic swimming pool.

176
00:05:54,680 --> 00:05:56,920
 You've got one beautiful clear lane of water,

177
00:05:56,920 --> 00:05:58,960
 and all the others are plamange, basically.

178
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:01,040
 (laughing)

179
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:02,120
 - So it's neither of those things.

180
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:02,960
 - It's neither of those.

181
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:03,800
 No, the Australian cricket team

182
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:05,380
 have been using it for years to--

183
00:06:05,380 --> 00:06:07,080
 - No, they haven't. - Classic, all right.

184
00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:08,400
 (laughing)

185
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:10,800
 It's bad that I believe that.

186
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:13,040
 - What it is, is actually, I don't think it's a control,

187
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:14,160
 I jumped the gun a bit.

188
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:15,960
 I think it's also been used by athletes

189
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:18,640
 and bodybuilders, although I'm not completely sure

190
00:06:18,640 --> 00:06:19,880
 if what capacity.

191
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:21,760
 - Maybe make them smoother.

192
00:06:21,760 --> 00:06:23,320
 To make them look smoother.

193
00:06:23,320 --> 00:06:25,360
 - That might be it, yeah.

194
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:27,000
 - There's the control.

195
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,040
 - I said I jumped the gun on it, I really.

196
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:31,120
 But there is, okay, there is a thing.

197
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:34,360
 It's an aphrodisiac, which is good news, but for rats.

198
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:35,800
 - So, okay. - Good news for rats.

199
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:38,120
 - It's fancy rats. - It's fancy rats.

200
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:39,560
 - Really, I mean, it really,

201
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:41,320
 and I think it's a fertility aid, actually.

202
00:06:41,320 --> 00:06:43,360
 It ramps up your testicles, is the phrase I've written down.

203
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:45,000
 - Ramps up your testicles.

204
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,880
 - You don't want to put ramps up your testicles,

205
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:48,440
 that's gonna be.

206
00:06:48,440 --> 00:06:50,680
 - Odd, not too much and tiny little effusions now.

207
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:54,000
 Climbing up, wheelchair-friendly testicles.

208
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,160
 Fun.

209
00:06:55,160 --> 00:06:56,720
 - What does it do, sorry, to your testicles?

210
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:57,920
 - It ramps them up.

211
00:06:57,920 --> 00:07:00,000
 - What's that mean, like the outer coating,

212
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,040
 or like the inner ball?

213
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:04,320
 - It gives the sperm a lot more motility,

214
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:06,920
 and I think it makes the balls bigger, maybe, as well.

215
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:10,360
 - The caragine is responsible for my fair lady,

216
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:13,520
 the musical. - Really?

217
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:14,640
 - Well, we'll see.

218
00:07:14,640 --> 00:07:15,560
 - Wow.

219
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:18,560
 - So, it's used in medical circuits.

220
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:19,720
 - These are terrible headlines,

221
00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:21,360
 these are like those websites, they're like,

222
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:22,200
 did you know that?

223
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:24,680
 - I mean, it's just not there.

224
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:26,880
 - The controversy, you're seaweed.

225
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:30,280
 - Well, it's used medicinally, Irish masks.

226
00:07:30,280 --> 00:07:32,080
 It's good for like your throat,

227
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:34,120
 it's supposed to be good for your throat.

228
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:35,600
 In fact, there's some evidence

229
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:38,760
 that it might stunt the replication of COVID, as well,

230
00:07:38,760 --> 00:07:40,680
 although that's not certain yet.

231
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:42,560
 But anyway, the person who introduced it

232
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:45,640
 into medical use was a guy called Mr. Todd Hunter.

233
00:07:45,640 --> 00:07:48,760
 And Mr. Todd Hunter is more famous as a playwright.

234
00:07:48,760 --> 00:07:50,760
 Okay, and he did a play called

235
00:07:50,760 --> 00:07:54,440
 The Land of Hearts Desire in Dublin,

236
00:07:54,440 --> 00:07:57,400
 and it was so bad, so, so bad,

237
00:07:57,400 --> 00:07:59,200
 that everyone just booed him off.

238
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:01,160
 They kept booing him, every time he put it on,

239
00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:02,680
 they booed him off, they booed him off,

240
00:08:02,680 --> 00:08:06,440
 was taken off the rotor of the playhouse,

241
00:08:06,440 --> 00:08:09,120
 and it was replaced by Arms of the Man,

242
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:12,200
 which was the first success of George Bernard Shaw,

243
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:13,800
 who went on to write Pygmalion,

244
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:15,240
 which my fair lady was based on.

245
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:16,720
 - Yes. - I was gonna guess that.

246
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:17,560
 - Yeah. - Yeah.

247
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:18,880
 - That's flawless. - That's amazing.

248
00:08:18,880 --> 00:08:21,400
 - Actually, I think that does check out, that's great.

249
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:25,440
 I've got in my notes here, I don't know who wrote these.

250
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:28,200
 The Irish Moss saved America,

251
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:33,200
 because there was a lot of it grown in the USA,

252
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:37,840
 and there, in fact, there's a town near Boston,

253
00:08:37,840 --> 00:08:39,240
 it's called Skituate.

254
00:08:40,920 --> 00:08:43,760
 Skituated, very near Boston, brilliant,

255
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:46,400
 which is, supposedly, it calls itself

256
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:48,120
 the most Irish town in the whole of the USA,

257
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:51,040
 about 50% of the population there are Irish,

258
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:52,640
 and from the 1840s onwards,

259
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:55,160
 it was a big site for Irish moss farming,

260
00:08:55,160 --> 00:08:57,360
 as in they farmed it, they grew it.

261
00:08:57,360 --> 00:09:01,360
 - Yeah, you get it, it kind of comes onto the shore

262
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:03,480
 in North America and in Europe, doesn't it?

263
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:05,480
 - Exactly, yeah, yeah, and he saw some in the water,

264
00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:06,320
 and he thought, wait, I know that,

265
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:07,760
 I recognize that from when I was in Ireland,

266
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:10,040
 and so he set up the industry, basically,

267
00:09:10,040 --> 00:09:11,480
 this guy who's called Daniel Ward.

268
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:14,000
 Anyway, so it became big, big, big industry for this town.

269
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,400
 During the Second World War,

270
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:17,640
 suddenly, there was a thing called agar,

271
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:19,640
 it's an agar jelly, you know?

272
00:09:19,640 --> 00:09:20,640
 That was no longer available,

273
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:22,440
 'cause that was grown in the Far East.

274
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:26,240
 - Okay, and you need agar to grow bacteria and stuff?

275
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:27,680
 - Well, it's a thickening agent,

276
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:29,320
 it's in all sorts of foods,

277
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:30,960
 and basically, it was no longer available,

278
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:32,920
 'cause it was largely grown in Japan and places like that,

279
00:09:32,920 --> 00:09:35,320
 which were obviously no longer trading with the USA.

280
00:09:35,320 --> 00:09:37,360
 Irish moss carrion, and basically,

281
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:39,520
 rocketed in production.

282
00:09:39,520 --> 00:09:43,080
 In Canada, they made 261,000 pounds in 1941.

283
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:45,800
 The next year, they made over 2 million pounds

284
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:48,040
 of this stuff for use in foods.

285
00:09:48,040 --> 00:09:50,040
 Yeah, it was a huge deal.

286
00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:52,040
 - And why did it save America?

287
00:09:52,040 --> 00:09:52,880
 - Well--

288
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:53,880
 - Otherwise, they would have starved to death

289
00:09:53,880 --> 00:09:55,200
 if they didn't have ice cream or whatever.

290
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:57,160
 - Well, they wouldn't have had pleasant sauces,

291
00:09:57,160 --> 00:09:59,520
 drinks of war, in fact, on morale.

292
00:09:59,520 --> 00:10:02,240
 - Yeah, yeah, is it called the man in the high castle,

293
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:03,720
 where they imagined that the Germans

294
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:04,920
 had won the Second World War?

295
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:07,720
 - I think we should make a prequel of it,

296
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:09,840
 where we actually look at what the reason

297
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:12,720
 they lost the war, and it was because of this lack of aga.

298
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:14,440
 - Probably, that's huge, yeah.

299
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:15,280
 - That's right.

300
00:10:15,280 --> 00:10:16,520
 - So, are you buying that?

301
00:10:16,520 --> 00:10:17,360
 - Nope.

302
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:18,200
 (laughing)

303
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:19,040
 - You know how we were saying

304
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:20,960
 that carrageen was in health food?

305
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:23,320
 Always has been, many thousands of years has been round,

306
00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:25,360
 and I came across an article in the New York Times

307
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:28,400
 in, I think it was, like, 1904 or something,

308
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:30,640
 and it was, I just found it really amusing

309
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:32,880
 how little the police obviously had to do at this time.

310
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:36,840
 So, it was a story about how a Romanian gypsy woman

311
00:10:36,840 --> 00:10:40,520
 had been arrested in Jamaica for charging over $7,000,

312
00:10:40,520 --> 00:10:43,440
 which was a lot then, for basically Irish moss.

313
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:45,200
 - It's a lot now for Irish moss.

314
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:46,040
 - It's good.

315
00:10:46,040 --> 00:10:46,880
 - It is, don't pay that for Irish moss.

316
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:48,880
 - But how much Irish moss are we talking about?

317
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:50,400
 - It was a very small tincture

318
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:52,560
 dropped in a glass of water, in secret.

319
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:53,720
 - $7,000?

320
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:54,560
 - Yeah, it's too much, isn't it?

321
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:55,480
 - Who's the buyer?

322
00:10:55,480 --> 00:10:58,000
 - Well, it was this lady who had a hunchback

323
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,360
 that she wanted cured, so she employed a healer,

324
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:02,560
 this woman who said she was Romanian.

325
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:05,040
 Anyway, the healer said she boiled some water,

326
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:06,800
 she covered it with cloth and she said,

327
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:09,160
 "Look at that water, don't touch it, don't move,

328
00:11:09,160 --> 00:11:12,080
 "don't tell anyone for 24 hours what I've done,

329
00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:13,480
 "and then you'll be cured."

330
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:16,080
 And the woman, idiot, ruined the cure by telling her mates,

331
00:11:16,080 --> 00:11:17,640
 she was like, "Look, I've employed this doctor,

332
00:11:17,640 --> 00:11:19,880
 "but I'm a bit suspicious about the cure,"

333
00:11:19,880 --> 00:11:20,880
 'cause she just told me to, like,

334
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:22,320
 not touch this glass of water for 24 hours.

335
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:24,080
 - For 24 hours, while she goes to the coast

336
00:11:24,080 --> 00:11:26,360
 and gets the nearest ship with her new $7,000.

337
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:27,680
 - Well, no, 'cause she'd only charged,

338
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:28,960
 like, a hundred at that point.

339
00:11:28,960 --> 00:11:30,840
 So, the woman reported it to the police.

340
00:11:30,840 --> 00:11:32,600
 Two detectives came to her house,

341
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:34,480
 hid behind the curtains,

342
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:37,640
 and the Romanian lady came back to say,

343
00:11:37,640 --> 00:11:39,960
 "You know, okay, that was the first step,

344
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:41,920
 "now the next step comes,"

345
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:44,720
 and the detectives saw her slip some Irish moss

346
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:46,920
 into the water and then say,

347
00:11:46,920 --> 00:11:49,640
 "Okay, now I'm gonna charge you $7,000,"

348
00:11:49,640 --> 00:11:51,680
 and then, as she was gonna hand over the money

349
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:53,720
 in the details, the detectives jumped up.

350
00:11:53,720 --> 00:11:56,160
 - Do you get police doing that much these days?

351
00:11:56,160 --> 00:11:57,400
 Sort of, "We'll come into your house,

352
00:11:57,400 --> 00:11:58,560
 "hide behind your curtains."

353
00:11:58,560 --> 00:11:59,800
 - I think that's fine. - That's whether you don't.

354
00:11:59,800 --> 00:12:01,520
 I think it's a disgrace.

355
00:12:01,520 --> 00:12:02,960
 I want, for my taxes,

356
00:12:02,960 --> 00:12:05,520
 I want policemen hiding behind my curtains

357
00:12:05,520 --> 00:12:06,360
 every day of the week.

358
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:07,840
 - Did she have an exact time she was coming back?

359
00:12:07,840 --> 00:12:10,760
 How long were the police hiding behind the curtains?

360
00:12:10,760 --> 00:12:11,920
 - She said Wednesday.

361
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:14,400
 - Passing another cup of tea behind the curtains.

362
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:16,240
 (laughing)

363
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:17,120
 - She had to knock,

364
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:18,440
 so they could just hang out in the kitchen,

365
00:12:18,440 --> 00:12:19,280
 I suppose, until--

366
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:20,760
 - Like a surprise party.

367
00:12:20,760 --> 00:12:22,200
 Everyone, everyone, quick, quick, quick, quick.

368
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:23,040
 - Exactly, exactly.

369
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:24,720
 - False alarm, it's an Amazon delivery.

370
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:27,600
 - Did you guys hear about Mim Flynn?

371
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:28,560
 - Mim Flynn. - Mim Flynn.

372
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:30,040
 - The Irish mossing queen?

373
00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:30,880
 - No. - No.

374
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:32,520
 (laughing)

375
00:12:32,520 --> 00:12:34,480
 - She was, she wasn't a beauty queen or anything.

376
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:38,080
 She was the queen of the Irish moss industry

377
00:12:38,080 --> 00:12:40,320
 because she was a great mosser,

378
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:42,000
 and she started at the age of nine.

379
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,320
 - Is a mosser someone who eats it or who collects it?

380
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:45,160
 - Harvested it.

381
00:12:45,160 --> 00:12:48,760
 - I think she was in Skituate, Skituate.

382
00:12:48,760 --> 00:12:50,600
 - I thought you said she was Irish.

383
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:51,680
 - No, Irish moss.

384
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:52,520
 - Oh, I see.

385
00:12:52,520 --> 00:12:53,520
 - Oh, where was she? - She was the--

386
00:12:53,520 --> 00:12:54,360
 - America. - In Skituate.

387
00:12:54,360 --> 00:12:57,160
 - She was the American Irish mossing--

388
00:12:57,160 --> 00:12:59,600
 - Did we not pay attention?

389
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:00,840
 Remember his hilarious pun earlier?

390
00:13:00,840 --> 00:13:02,160
 - It's just outside Boston.

391
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:03,840
 - I blank them out too, but--

392
00:13:03,840 --> 00:13:06,440
 - Skituated, just outside Boston.

393
00:13:06,440 --> 00:13:09,160
 - I must not have been here at the time.

394
00:13:09,160 --> 00:13:10,500
 - I didn't hear.

395
00:13:10,500 --> 00:13:11,340
 - I don't think I was.

396
00:13:11,340 --> 00:13:12,180
 - I don't think there was any evidence.

397
00:13:12,180 --> 00:13:15,360
 - Audio, imagine if I had to out your original paper.

398
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:18,160
 (laughing)

399
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:19,880
 - So, but yeah, give us more about her.

400
00:13:19,880 --> 00:13:21,800
 Is she-- - How's she doing?

401
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:23,000
 - I think she's passed away now.

402
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:23,840
 - Right.

403
00:13:23,840 --> 00:13:24,920
 - But Skituate these days,

404
00:13:24,920 --> 00:13:26,640
 it does have a mossing museum.

405
00:13:26,640 --> 00:13:27,480
 - Cool.

406
00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:28,320
 - Yeah. - Is it?

407
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:29,160
 - Yeah, yeah.

408
00:13:29,160 --> 00:13:31,840
 There's no longer much of an industry as Moot Evices.

409
00:13:31,840 --> 00:13:32,960
 - Well, if you're in Skituate,

410
00:13:32,960 --> 00:13:34,160
 and you're wondering what to do.

411
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:37,120
 - Yeah, also, I've probably said Skituate wrong.

412
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:37,960
 That all the way through.

413
00:13:37,960 --> 00:13:40,080
 - So, look on the map, don't ask a local.

414
00:13:40,080 --> 00:13:40,920
 - Yeah, yeah.

415
00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:43,200
 Get a pair of compasses, put the middle point in Boston,

416
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:45,680
 and the other arm to 30 miles,

417
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:47,520
 and it'll be on that line.

418
00:13:47,520 --> 00:13:48,520
 - Which way? - Which way?

419
00:13:48,520 --> 00:13:49,840
 - Which way?

420
00:13:49,840 --> 00:13:51,040
 - Well, it'll be coastal.

421
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:53,320
 So, I only know it's 30 miles outside Boston.

422
00:13:53,320 --> 00:13:54,160
 - Okay, cool.

423
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:55,000
 (laughing)

424
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,520
 - Just go 30 miles south of Boston,

425
00:13:56,520 --> 00:13:57,880
 along the coast, and if it's not there,

426
00:13:57,880 --> 00:13:59,080
 go 60 miles north.

427
00:13:59,080 --> 00:14:01,040
 (laughing)

428
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:02,840
 - So, just on Belmont,

429
00:14:02,840 --> 00:14:04,400
 we should talk about the fact that

430
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:05,560
 it was only quite recently

431
00:14:05,560 --> 00:14:06,920
 that it stopped containing meat.

432
00:14:06,920 --> 00:14:08,000
 - Yeah. - Yeah.

433
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:08,840
 - Really? - Yeah.

434
00:14:08,840 --> 00:14:09,680
 Weird.

435
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:10,800
 So, Belmont's been around since,

436
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:11,760
 I think the earliest recipe

437
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:13,800
 maybe comes from Baghdad in the 10th century,

438
00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:15,680
 a long time,

439
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:17,320
 and it was only in the 18th century

440
00:14:17,320 --> 00:14:19,000
 they thought, "Let's stop putting chicken in this."

441
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:19,840
 - Yeah.

442
00:14:19,840 --> 00:14:20,680
 (laughing)

443
00:14:20,680 --> 00:14:22,320
 - It just sounds so rough.

444
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:24,840
 - They just used chicken as,

445
00:14:24,840 --> 00:14:26,360
 basically, in the same way

446
00:14:26,360 --> 00:14:27,440
 that they used this seaweed

447
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:29,880
 as kind of to make it more gelatinous,

448
00:14:29,880 --> 00:14:31,280
 to make it stringy.

449
00:14:31,280 --> 00:14:32,680
 It had a pleasant stringiness, I think.

450
00:14:32,680 --> 00:14:33,520
 - Oh, lovely.

451
00:14:33,520 --> 00:14:35,960
 - And you shredded and really pounded up the chicken,

452
00:14:35,960 --> 00:14:37,760
 so it lost all of its flavor, I believe,

453
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:40,920
 and mixed it up with some almond milk

454
00:14:40,920 --> 00:14:43,640
 and some sugar and some rice.

455
00:14:43,640 --> 00:14:45,360
 And yum, and they still eat it in turkey,

456
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:46,440
 almost the same thing, it seems like.

457
00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:47,280
 - Oh, really?

458
00:14:47,280 --> 00:14:48,920
 What actually would the chicken in still?

459
00:14:48,920 --> 00:14:51,360
 - Yeah, yeah, it's called tavuk gogsu,

460
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:53,240
 and it literally means,

461
00:14:53,240 --> 00:14:54,840
 and I really want English people to have gone

462
00:14:54,840 --> 00:14:56,440
 and ordered it, having done the Google translate,

463
00:14:56,440 --> 00:14:58,760
 'cause it literally means chicken breast.

464
00:14:58,760 --> 00:15:01,360
 But you order it, and what you get is a blamange.

465
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:03,320
 (laughing)

466
00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:04,640
 You look at everything on the menu,

467
00:15:04,640 --> 00:15:06,680
 and you're like, "Oh, I can't, I don't want that, I don't."

468
00:15:06,680 --> 00:15:07,800
 Oh, chicken breast!

469
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:09,560
 (laughing)

470
00:15:09,560 --> 00:15:10,560
 That's safe.

471
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:13,440
 - What a weird-ass chicken, so they have it in turkey.

472
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:14,840
 - Have you guys heard of Bompas and Pa?

473
00:15:14,840 --> 00:15:15,680
 - No.

474
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:16,840
 - They're a jelly innovation firm,

475
00:15:16,840 --> 00:15:19,480
 and they basically do absolutely mad things

476
00:15:19,480 --> 00:15:20,840
 with jelly all the time.

477
00:15:20,840 --> 00:15:23,280
 They're constantly coming up with incredible innovations,

478
00:15:23,280 --> 00:15:25,600
 and weird flavors, and anyway,

479
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:27,800
 I just look through a list of all the things

480
00:15:27,800 --> 00:15:28,880
 they've done over the years.

481
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:31,840
 One year, for Valentine's Day, they created a jelly

482
00:15:31,840 --> 00:15:34,200
 which was called throbber.

483
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:35,040
 - Oh, boy.

484
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:37,680
 - THROBR, which I can--

485
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:38,760
 - Sounds like an app, doesn't it?

486
00:15:38,760 --> 00:15:40,640
 - It does sound like an app.

487
00:15:40,640 --> 00:15:42,160
 It's amazing what this jelly does.

488
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:44,640
 It locks onto your heart rate,

489
00:15:44,640 --> 00:15:48,760
 and it pulses in time with your heart rate

490
00:15:48,760 --> 00:15:50,400
 as you're eating it.

491
00:15:50,400 --> 00:15:51,640
 I don't know.

492
00:15:51,640 --> 00:15:53,120
 So if you get very excited as you're eating

493
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:55,560
 the jelly, the jelly itself will start reflecting that.

494
00:15:55,560 --> 00:15:58,720
 - It does feel like, 'cause it's called throbber,

495
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:01,920
 that perhaps, if you got an erection,

496
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:04,200
 the stiffer your erection, the stiffer the jelly

497
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:05,040
 would get.

498
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:06,760
 (all laughing)

499
00:16:06,760 --> 00:16:08,040
 - Make a steak knife for this one.

500
00:16:08,040 --> 00:16:10,640
 (all laughing)

501
00:16:10,640 --> 00:16:18,160
 - Okay, it is time for fact number two,

502
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:20,040
 and that is James.

503
00:16:20,040 --> 00:16:22,640
 - Okay, my fact this week is that when communism fell

504
00:16:22,640 --> 00:16:26,080
 in Czechoslovakia, the US ambassador in the country

505
00:16:26,080 --> 00:16:27,840
 was Shirley Temple.

506
00:16:27,840 --> 00:16:29,400
 (all laughing)

507
00:16:29,400 --> 00:16:30,720
 - Really weird.

508
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:32,120
 - I think this is amazing.

509
00:16:32,120 --> 00:16:33,640
 Some people might know this already.

510
00:16:33,640 --> 00:16:35,320
 I've spoken to one or two people who have,

511
00:16:35,320 --> 00:16:39,400
 but to me, Shirley Temple is a child movie star

512
00:16:39,400 --> 00:16:41,480
 who basically retired when she was 10 years old.

513
00:16:41,480 --> 00:16:42,320
 - Exactly.

514
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:44,440
 - But actually, when she got a bit older,

515
00:16:44,440 --> 00:16:46,640
 when she was 44, she became a diplomat,

516
00:16:46,640 --> 00:16:48,920
 and she did loads of stuff for the US.

517
00:16:48,920 --> 00:16:52,880
 She was the first woman to serve as US ambassador to Ghana,

518
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:56,680
 but she was also the ambassador in Czechoslovakia in 1989

519
00:16:56,680 --> 00:16:58,920
 when the Velvet Revolution happened,

520
00:16:58,920 --> 00:17:02,840
 and the communist regime fell in what is now Czechia,

521
00:17:02,840 --> 00:17:03,840
 and Slovakia.

522
00:17:03,840 --> 00:17:04,800
 - Yeah. - Amazing.

523
00:17:04,800 --> 00:17:05,640
 - It is amazing.

524
00:17:05,640 --> 00:17:07,560
 - Weirdly, she was sort of there

525
00:17:07,560 --> 00:17:09,240
 towards the start as well, wasn't she?

526
00:17:09,240 --> 00:17:11,320
 She thinks maybe one of the things that helped her

527
00:17:11,320 --> 00:17:13,920
 get that gig was the fact that in the '60s,

528
00:17:13,920 --> 00:17:16,800
 she'd been in Czechoslovakia,

529
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:19,480
 and I think she was working for a multiple sclerosis foundation,

530
00:17:19,480 --> 00:17:20,680
 which is where she got her taste

531
00:17:20,680 --> 00:17:22,400
 for international diplomacy and stuff,

532
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:23,920
 so her brother had MS,

533
00:17:23,920 --> 00:17:26,280
 and so she founded this organization.

534
00:17:26,280 --> 00:17:28,640
 She was doing some international work in Czechoslovakia,

535
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:31,440
 and she happened to be there at the time

536
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:32,760
 that the Russians basically invaded

537
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:35,440
 to crush the uprising, to crush the Prague Spring,

538
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:38,680
 and yeah, she remembers watching from her balcony

539
00:17:38,680 --> 00:17:40,240
 as a woman got gunned down,

540
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:42,080
 and that made her think, yeah,

541
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:43,960
 I'll take a career in diplomacy.

542
00:17:43,960 --> 00:17:44,800
 (laughing)

543
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:46,240
 - Yeah, the other thing was that she married

544
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:49,440
 her second husband in, I think, in her 30s,

545
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:52,560
 and he was an aquaculture engineer and oceanographer,

546
00:17:52,560 --> 00:17:55,360
 so that also got her to go into the environmental side

547
00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:57,160
 of diplomacy, so that was part of it.

548
00:17:57,160 --> 00:18:00,360
 - She's really, I mean, so she did have political ambitions

549
00:18:00,360 --> 00:18:01,680
 outside of being an ambassador.

550
00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:04,880
 She was a Republican candidate.

551
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:07,800
 She wanted to run for the House of Representatives in 1967,

552
00:18:07,800 --> 00:18:11,600
 and she lost out to a guy called Congressman Pete McCloskey,

553
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:14,720
 but she obviously had close relationships

554
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:16,480
 with the leading Republicans at the time,

555
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:18,080
 because it was under Gerald Ford

556
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:20,240
 that she was the ambassador to Ghana.

557
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:22,840
 She was under Ronald Reagan when she did another

558
00:18:22,840 --> 00:18:24,800
 of her posts, and then the Czechoslovakia one

559
00:18:24,800 --> 00:18:28,400
 was George H.W. Bush, Bush Sr.

560
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:30,200
 She must have been really good mates with them,

561
00:18:30,200 --> 00:18:33,080
 and you can see that this child stock,

562
00:18:33,080 --> 00:18:35,560
 'cause Shirley Temple really is even to my generation.

563
00:18:35,560 --> 00:18:37,680
 I used to watch her movies in black and white as a kid.

564
00:18:37,680 --> 00:18:39,680
 Like, I know-- - When were you born?

565
00:18:39,680 --> 00:18:41,760
 (laughing)

566
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:43,400
 - Danny, you're 100 years old.

567
00:18:43,400 --> 00:18:44,600
 - Right, okay.

568
00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:46,880
 - Yeah, no, but no, like, she's still a name

569
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:47,880
 that most of us know.

570
00:18:47,880 --> 00:18:50,520
 I mean, largely it might because of the drink,

571
00:18:50,520 --> 00:18:53,160
 the non-alcoholic mocktail that you can get.

572
00:18:53,160 --> 00:18:54,560
 - But before this, I thought Shirley Temple,

573
00:18:54,560 --> 00:18:57,720
 old child, sort of, like, curly hair, child actor,

574
00:18:57,720 --> 00:18:59,200
 like, hugely famous child star,

575
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:00,520
 and also non-alcoholic drink.

576
00:19:00,520 --> 00:19:02,240
 - I only thought Good Ship Lollipop,

577
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:03,800
 which was that song that she sang.

578
00:19:03,800 --> 00:19:05,160
 That's basically all I know about.

579
00:19:05,160 --> 00:19:06,480
 - But in a lot of her early films,

580
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:08,680
 she preaches fiscal responsibility,

581
00:19:08,680 --> 00:19:11,800
 and the importance of a low-tax, small state.

582
00:19:11,800 --> 00:19:13,040
 So it's kind of unsurprising that her--

583
00:19:13,040 --> 00:19:14,880
 - That's who we should have seen it, actually.

584
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:17,360
 - She was an independent Republican candidate,

585
00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:20,080
 I think, for the 1967 election

586
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:22,400
 to be a part of the U.S. House of Representatives.

587
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:23,240
 - What does that mean in the end?

588
00:19:23,240 --> 00:19:25,920
 - I believe that it means she was Republican,

589
00:19:25,920 --> 00:19:28,440
 but she wasn't officially on the ticket, I think.

590
00:19:28,440 --> 00:19:29,840
 I'm not sure about that.

591
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:31,520
 But she said during the election,

592
00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:33,720
 "I think men are fine and here to stay,

593
00:19:33,720 --> 00:19:35,240
 "but I have a hunch that it wouldn't hurt

594
00:19:35,240 --> 00:19:37,000
 "to have a woman's viewpoint expressed

595
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,240
 "in that delegation of 38 men."

596
00:19:39,240 --> 00:19:42,120
 - Mmm, yeah. - Too much too soon, Shirley.

597
00:19:42,120 --> 00:19:43,400
 (laughing)

598
00:19:43,400 --> 00:19:45,680
 - She started, okay, so she's a child actor, as we know,

599
00:19:45,680 --> 00:19:47,280
 in sort of like age six.

600
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:49,600
 She was already winning like special Oscars

601
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:50,840
 that were being given to her.

602
00:19:50,840 --> 00:19:51,760
 Like, she was a big deal.

603
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:53,840
 What's, I did not know this.

604
00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:56,320
 There's something quite seedy about her intro

605
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:57,880
 into the world of acting.

606
00:19:57,880 --> 00:19:59,040
 Nothing against her.

607
00:19:59,040 --> 00:20:00,680
 It's her parents who obviously signed her up.

608
00:20:00,680 --> 00:20:02,760
 She was three at the time, you know.

609
00:20:02,760 --> 00:20:05,920
 And it was part of this thing called baby burlesques.

610
00:20:05,920 --> 00:20:08,360
 - Yes, it's incredibly weird.

611
00:20:08,360 --> 00:20:09,360
 - Yeah, did you watch it?

612
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:10,200
 'Cause I didn't.

613
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:12,960
 (laughing)

614
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:15,400
 - The bad news is we've all had our laptops taken away.

615
00:20:15,400 --> 00:20:17,280
 (laughing)

616
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:18,560
 Is it online, I assume, or is it not?

617
00:20:18,560 --> 00:20:19,880
 - It must be somewhere, right?

618
00:20:19,880 --> 00:20:21,640
 - It must be historical.

619
00:20:21,640 --> 00:20:22,560
 - 'Cause it's quite obscure.

620
00:20:22,560 --> 00:20:23,640
 It's like early 30s.

621
00:20:23,640 --> 00:20:24,480
 I think it's hard.

622
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:25,520
 I couldn't find an online version.

623
00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:26,840
 There's one film which I reckon you can get

624
00:20:26,840 --> 00:20:27,880
 on YouTube if you tried.

625
00:20:27,880 --> 00:20:29,440
 - Oh, it's on the dark web.

626
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:31,880
 (laughing)

627
00:20:31,880 --> 00:20:33,720
 - So what, yeah, sorry, Dad, you should tell what it was.

628
00:20:33,720 --> 00:20:35,720
 - Yeah, okay, so it's described by The New York Times

629
00:20:35,720 --> 00:20:38,280
 as a series of sexually suggestive one real shorts

630
00:20:38,280 --> 00:20:40,560
 in which children played all the roles.

631
00:20:40,560 --> 00:20:42,760
 - Yeah, so what it was is basically

632
00:20:42,760 --> 00:20:45,720
 they were parodies of films for grown-ups.

633
00:20:45,720 --> 00:20:49,040
 So at the time, all the grown-up stars

634
00:20:49,040 --> 00:20:51,840
 were people like Marlena Dietrich and Mae West,

635
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:54,880
 and they were obviously very sexy women

636
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:56,480
 with very flirtatious dialogue.

637
00:20:56,480 --> 00:20:57,400
 And these baby burlesques,

638
00:20:57,400 --> 00:21:00,240
 they kind of did parody versions of these films

639
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:02,200
 where there are children playing the roles.

640
00:21:02,200 --> 00:21:03,720
 - Like Bugsie Malone, I guess, right?

641
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:04,960
 Is like a close version of it.

642
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:07,200
 - Yeah, but not with like saucy dialogue.

643
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:08,960
 - It's so weird. - I'm a three-year-old.

644
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:09,960
 - So weird.

645
00:21:09,960 --> 00:21:11,960
 - In defense of the olden days.

646
00:21:11,960 --> 00:21:14,000
 - Oh, come on. - I think it was probably okay.

647
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,960
 It was a comedy, and they wore,

648
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:19,840
 so they'd wear sexy outfits on the top half,

649
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:21,560
 and then they'd have their nappies on,

650
00:21:21,560 --> 00:21:22,720
 on the bottom half,

651
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:24,960
 like they're doing kind of a Zoom meeting from home.

652
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:26,800
 (laughing)

653
00:21:26,800 --> 00:21:28,200
 - I don't think it would get made today.

654
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:29,360
 - No. - And the stories

655
00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:30,880
 that Shirley Temple would tell about it

656
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:32,440
 in later in her autobiography,

657
00:21:32,440 --> 00:21:34,280
 where she'd say that if they got in trouble,

658
00:21:34,280 --> 00:21:37,320
 the kids that were part of this production

659
00:21:37,320 --> 00:21:39,160
 would be sent off to a sound booth

660
00:21:39,160 --> 00:21:41,120
 where they'd have to sit on a block of ice.

661
00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:43,440
 - Apparently, every night,

662
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:46,040
 Shirley Temple's mother would curl her hair

663
00:21:46,040 --> 00:21:48,400
 into 56 perfect curls,

664
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:49,520
 so she would have to sit there

665
00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:51,520
 and do her hair every single night.

666
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:53,600
 And then she would be read a bedtime story,

667
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:56,000
 but the bedtime story was the next day's script

668
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:57,480
 that she had to learn.

669
00:21:57,480 --> 00:21:59,560
 And so the mother would read the lines from the script,

670
00:21:59,560 --> 00:22:00,880
 and she'd have to parrot them back,

671
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:02,560
 and she'd keep doing that until she fell asleep.

672
00:22:02,560 --> 00:22:03,760
 - So Shirley Temple's mom got her,

673
00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:06,800
 she does sound like a proper, classic,

674
00:22:06,800 --> 00:22:10,600
 good old fashioned Hollywood insane pushy mum, as in.

675
00:22:10,600 --> 00:22:13,680
 She ensured that other child actors

676
00:22:13,680 --> 00:22:15,120
 who might threaten her daughter's roles

677
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:16,680
 had their parts cut.

678
00:22:16,680 --> 00:22:17,520
 - Which parts?

679
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:19,240
 (laughing)

680
00:22:19,240 --> 00:22:21,600
 Body parts. - Fingers, yeah, yeah.

681
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:23,520
 And so she was very protective,

682
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:26,760
 very, very forceful in getting Shirley too fame.

683
00:22:26,760 --> 00:22:30,240
 Also, one thing she stole from Shirley Temple herself

684
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:31,800
 was the year of her life.

685
00:22:31,800 --> 00:22:33,960
 She knocked a year off Shirley Temple's age.

686
00:22:33,960 --> 00:22:35,280
 So Shirley was at her--

687
00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:37,040
 - That's actually giving someone an extra year.

688
00:22:37,040 --> 00:22:39,400
 - Oh my God, she's the perfect mum.

689
00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:40,240
 (laughing)

690
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:42,040
 - I mean, if my mum could suddenly turn around

691
00:22:42,040 --> 00:22:44,440
 and say that I'm 35, that'd be great.

692
00:22:44,440 --> 00:22:45,440
 - Well, no, but she wouldn't be.

693
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:47,200
 She'd be telling you a year, as in,

694
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:50,640
 so Shirley Temple was at her 12th birthday party,

695
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:52,600
 and her mum said, "Oh, by the way, you're 13."

696
00:22:52,600 --> 00:22:55,520
 - Ah, well, but when she was nine,

697
00:22:55,520 --> 00:22:56,800
 they said that she was eight.

698
00:22:56,800 --> 00:22:58,800
 - But that's why, so that's because

699
00:22:58,800 --> 00:23:00,160
 it's all part of the same story.

700
00:23:00,160 --> 00:23:01,000
 - It's all the same process.

701
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:03,760
 See, when she was three or four, her mum thought,

702
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:05,080
 "Oh no, she's getting a bit too old

703
00:23:05,080 --> 00:23:06,720
 "for this whole baby game."

704
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:07,800
 Like, she's about to be,

705
00:23:07,800 --> 00:23:09,600
 no, I think she was about to turn five and a half

706
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:10,680
 or something, so her mum was like,

707
00:23:10,680 --> 00:23:12,520
 "Right, we're gonna make her four and a half again."

708
00:23:12,520 --> 00:23:14,800
 And then Shirley, from the age of four and a half,

709
00:23:14,800 --> 00:23:16,520
 thought that she was four and a half,

710
00:23:16,520 --> 00:23:17,360
 five and a half, six and a half,

711
00:23:17,360 --> 00:23:18,800
 and then it was when she was 12

712
00:23:18,800 --> 00:23:20,960
 that her mum went, "Actually, surprise."

713
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:22,040
 Welcome to a teenagerhood.

714
00:23:22,040 --> 00:23:24,360
 - She's like turning the clock back in the autumn

715
00:23:24,360 --> 00:23:26,080
 and turning it forward again in the spring.

716
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:27,160
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. - Exactly.

717
00:23:27,160 --> 00:23:28,760
 - So your mum could do this for you, James,

718
00:23:28,760 --> 00:23:30,800
 but you'd be on borrowed time.

719
00:23:30,840 --> 00:23:34,080
 - I'm perhaps borrowing time at this stage of my life.

720
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:37,160
 I am up for borrowing any time I can borrow.

721
00:23:37,160 --> 00:23:41,040
 And on her eighth birthday, so she was actually nine,

722
00:23:41,040 --> 00:23:43,280
 but she was, I thought she was eight,

723
00:23:43,280 --> 00:23:46,600
 she got 135,000 gifts.

724
00:23:46,600 --> 00:23:48,480
 - Yeah, that's amazing, isn't it?

725
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:49,600
 - Pretty amazing.

726
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:51,960
 And it was sent to her by fans around the world, right?

727
00:23:51,960 --> 00:23:53,120
 - No, all from her mum. - It wasn't just her parents,

728
00:23:53,120 --> 00:23:54,720
 yeah, her mum was, yeah.

729
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:58,000
 - She got a kangaroo from Australia.

730
00:23:58,000 --> 00:23:59,600
 - That's a burden, anything. - What?

731
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:00,440
 - Is it?

732
00:24:00,440 --> 00:24:02,280
 Well, you can keep other presents in the pouch.

733
00:24:02,280 --> 00:24:05,200
 - Good point, guys, it's a suitcase.

734
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:08,400
 - Yeah, it sounds, her life just sounds insane.

735
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:11,360
 She was the biggest box office star of the year

736
00:24:11,360 --> 00:24:13,320
 in 1936, '37, and '38,

737
00:24:13,320 --> 00:24:15,080
 which I think were the years where she was eight, nine,

738
00:24:15,080 --> 00:24:16,520
 and 10, I mean.

739
00:24:16,520 --> 00:24:18,400
 - She's the biggest child star that's ever been.

740
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:20,280
 There's been no contest ever since, really.

741
00:24:20,280 --> 00:24:22,400
 - Carly Culkin is the only other one I could think of.

742
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:24,840
 - I think in terms of the amount she earned at the time,

743
00:24:24,840 --> 00:24:26,600
 the fact that she was the only person

744
00:24:26,600 --> 00:24:28,200
 anyone wanted in any films,

745
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:29,480
 between the ages of three and 10,

746
00:24:29,480 --> 00:24:31,240
 she was in 29 films.

747
00:24:31,240 --> 00:24:35,080
 1935, her salary was $2,500 a week.

748
00:24:35,080 --> 00:24:37,840
 This is when she was seven, six or seven.

749
00:24:37,840 --> 00:24:39,160
 - That was a lot of money in those days.

750
00:24:39,160 --> 00:24:42,360
 It wasn't just like a third of a tincture of Iron Moss.

751
00:24:42,360 --> 00:24:47,120
 - God, her house was stuffed with Iron Moss though, wow.

752
00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:48,680
 She was also responsible

753
00:24:48,680 --> 00:24:51,600
 for quite a random bit of cultural input, possibly,

754
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:54,120
 and that is the Novel, The Power and the Glory.

755
00:24:54,120 --> 00:24:54,960
 - Okay.

756
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:58,240
 - By Graham Greene, and this is because

757
00:24:58,240 --> 00:25:00,280
 she had sort of a feud with Graham Greene

758
00:25:00,280 --> 00:25:02,800
 at the age of sort of nine, eight or nine.

759
00:25:02,800 --> 00:25:05,560
 - It's so funny, I didn't celebrate with you.

760
00:25:05,560 --> 00:25:08,560
 - Do you remember in the 90s or the early 2000s,

761
00:25:08,560 --> 00:25:10,640
 they used to have celebrity boxing

762
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:12,680
 and like Ricky Gervais fought with,

763
00:25:12,680 --> 00:25:14,360
 I don't know, some random person.

764
00:25:14,360 --> 00:25:15,200
 - Did they?

765
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:16,040
 - Yeah, yeah.

766
00:25:16,040 --> 00:25:16,880
 - I don't remember that.

767
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:18,360
 - Like Patrick Kilty or something like that, yeah.

768
00:25:18,360 --> 00:25:21,720
 - I just want to see Graham Greene in Shirley Temple.

769
00:25:21,720 --> 00:25:22,960
 - Clocking Shirley Temple.

770
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:25,320
 - That is a pay-per-view I would pay for.

771
00:25:25,320 --> 00:25:26,640
 - I think I'd back Shirley.

772
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:29,440
 She was pretty tough under those ringlets.

773
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:30,560
 He was quite mean about her.

774
00:25:30,560 --> 00:25:33,520
 He wrote a review of her films saying,

775
00:25:33,520 --> 00:25:35,600
 sort of suggesting that she was trained

776
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:37,960
 to deliberately be a bit cocket-ish.

777
00:25:37,960 --> 00:25:40,320
 Saying she symbolized dimpled depravity.

778
00:25:40,320 --> 00:25:41,880
 She had a well-developed rump.

779
00:25:41,880 --> 00:25:44,560
 And suggesting that her films were targeting

780
00:25:44,560 --> 00:25:45,800
 sleazy middle-aged men.

781
00:25:45,800 --> 00:25:49,440
 And it's unclear how humorous he was being.

782
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:51,360
 Having read it, I don't think he was being that humorous.

783
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:53,280
 I think it was just a pretty nasty review.

784
00:25:53,280 --> 00:25:57,640
 And then her mum and Fox decided to sue him for slander,

785
00:25:57,640 --> 00:25:59,520
 for saying that, for suggesting that.

786
00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:02,920
 And he, according to a friend who wrote a biography of him,

787
00:26:02,920 --> 00:26:07,080
 years later, he realized that he was about to be sued.

788
00:26:07,080 --> 00:26:08,800
 And so he might go to prison.

789
00:26:08,800 --> 00:26:12,280
 So he fled from England, where he was, to Mexico,

790
00:26:12,280 --> 00:26:14,200
 which didn't have any extradition rules.

791
00:26:14,200 --> 00:26:17,680
 And in Mexico, that was where he was inspired to write,

792
00:26:17,680 --> 00:26:19,520
 maybe his greatest magnum opus,

793
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:21,080
 Para and the Glory, set in Mexico.

794
00:26:21,080 --> 00:26:21,920
 - Done a case.

795
00:26:21,920 --> 00:26:22,760
 - About oppression of Catholics.

796
00:26:22,760 --> 00:26:26,520
 - As an adult, she broke the ice, whatever,

797
00:26:26,520 --> 00:26:27,600
 she sent him a copy.

798
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:29,560
 - She was been sitting on all that time.

799
00:26:29,560 --> 00:26:31,160
 - She sent him a copy of her autobiography,

800
00:26:31,160 --> 00:26:32,400
 and she invited him to tea.

801
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:34,560
 So clearly there weren't very many hard feelings

802
00:26:34,560 --> 00:26:35,960
 on her part.

803
00:26:35,960 --> 00:26:37,480
 - Well, she was a diplomat, wasn't she?

804
00:26:37,480 --> 00:26:38,800
 - Oh, yeah, there you go.

805
00:26:38,800 --> 00:26:41,160
 - Well, she had got 3,500 pounds

806
00:26:41,160 --> 00:26:43,320
 from Graham Greene in the settlement.

807
00:26:43,320 --> 00:26:44,680
 - I wonder how much she saw of that, though.

808
00:26:44,680 --> 00:26:45,880
 I haven't got this written down,

809
00:26:45,880 --> 00:26:47,440
 but I do, in the course of reading,

810
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:49,400
 remember that a lot of the money was taken

811
00:26:49,400 --> 00:26:51,800
 by the parents and wasn't seen by Shirley.

812
00:26:51,800 --> 00:26:52,920
 So I've got the figures.

813
00:26:52,920 --> 00:26:53,760
 - Yeah, what are they?

814
00:26:53,760 --> 00:26:57,920
 - Right, she earned $3,200,000 in her acting career,

815
00:26:57,920 --> 00:26:59,280
 quite a lot of money at the time.

816
00:26:59,280 --> 00:27:01,360
 By the time she was 22 years old,

817
00:27:01,360 --> 00:27:03,240
 there was $44,000 left.

818
00:27:03,240 --> 00:27:05,040
 - And was that because it was depleted by her parents?

819
00:27:05,040 --> 00:27:06,240
 - It was her dad, right?

820
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:08,000
 So her dad was a banker,

821
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:10,880
 and so he was in charge of all of her money,

822
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:13,040
 obviously her parents, they would be,

823
00:27:13,040 --> 00:27:14,360
 but she'd never blamed him.

824
00:27:14,360 --> 00:27:16,000
 She reckons that he got duped.

825
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:18,160
 So basically he made a load of bad investments

826
00:27:18,160 --> 00:27:20,200
 because people could see he was making a load of money,

827
00:27:20,200 --> 00:27:22,480
 and he didn't really, you know, he wasn't the greatest.

828
00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:24,040
 He left school when he was in seventh grade.

829
00:27:24,040 --> 00:27:25,880
 He wasn't the greatest banker of all time.

830
00:27:25,880 --> 00:27:26,720
 - I wonder if she was a banker?

831
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:29,000
 He was kind of like a monopoly banker, basically.

832
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:30,400
 "I'll be the banker, yeah, great."

833
00:27:30,400 --> 00:27:31,920
 - They should have looked underneath the bar.

834
00:27:31,920 --> 00:27:33,320
 That's where the money would have been.

835
00:27:33,320 --> 00:27:35,640
 But yeah, she said that she didn't blame him one little bit,

836
00:27:35,640 --> 00:27:37,760
 and it was the people that counseled him

837
00:27:37,760 --> 00:27:39,560
 who were the bad guys. - Who were the baddies, okay.

838
00:27:39,560 --> 00:27:42,520
 - Just a quite a nice link between her past

839
00:27:42,520 --> 00:27:44,560
 and her sort of future,

840
00:27:44,560 --> 00:27:47,080
 if you're placing yourself in 1940.

841
00:27:47,080 --> 00:27:48,440
 It goes back to this fact,

842
00:27:48,440 --> 00:27:49,600
 James' fact at the start of the show,

843
00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:51,040
 so when communism fell.

844
00:27:51,040 --> 00:27:53,520
 So basically, she never liked references

845
00:27:53,520 --> 00:27:55,720
 to her history as a child star, you know.

846
00:27:55,720 --> 00:27:57,000
 She would say it's not for everyone.

847
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:57,840
 Everyone was a child.

848
00:27:57,840 --> 00:27:59,240
 How come I'm the only one who,

849
00:27:59,240 --> 00:28:02,320
 as a very high achieving diplomat and politician,

850
00:28:02,320 --> 00:28:05,000
 you know, gets labeled as former child star?

851
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:06,400
 - Well, not everyone.

852
00:28:06,400 --> 00:28:09,240
 Like, that kind of havel wasn't in movies.

853
00:28:09,240 --> 00:28:12,080
 - We don't know.

854
00:28:12,080 --> 00:28:14,040
 There might have been some obscured Czech films

855
00:28:14,040 --> 00:28:18,080
 undiscovered with him spouting philosophy age nine.

856
00:28:18,080 --> 00:28:20,360
 But she did give them a treat just once.

857
00:28:20,360 --> 00:28:23,120
 So it was when communism did fall in Czechoslovakia,

858
00:28:23,120 --> 00:28:24,760
 big day, very exciting.

859
00:28:24,760 --> 00:28:26,920
 She called all of her senior staff together,

860
00:28:26,920 --> 00:28:28,360
 shut the doors, very private room,

861
00:28:28,360 --> 00:28:30,720
 and apparently looked them very sternly in the eye

862
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:33,000
 and said, "I'm only going to do this once."

863
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:34,400
 And then she started prancing around the room

864
00:28:34,400 --> 00:28:35,720
 and singing on the good chip lot.

865
00:28:35,720 --> 00:28:37,440
 (all laughing)

866
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:39,280
 - That's amazing. - It's awesome.

867
00:28:39,280 --> 00:28:42,200
 - I've just got one thing on child stars

868
00:28:42,200 --> 00:28:44,160
 and how to become a child star, because--

869
00:28:44,160 --> 00:28:45,000
 - A bit late for us.

870
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:46,640
 - A bit late for us, but you know,

871
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:48,000
 I've got a kid on the way,

872
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:50,880
 so I could actually get going on this,

873
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:53,440
 which is there's a company called Jam 2000,

874
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:55,120
 and they're the agency that basically,

875
00:28:55,120 --> 00:28:57,240
 when you see a baby in the UK on TV

876
00:28:57,240 --> 00:28:59,960
 and call the midwife, even the crown or Sherlock,

877
00:28:59,960 --> 00:29:01,360
 if there's a baby in it,

878
00:29:01,360 --> 00:29:03,880
 it's a good chance that Jam 2000 gave them.

879
00:29:03,880 --> 00:29:05,960
 So when the baby is born,

880
00:29:05,960 --> 00:29:07,440
 the baby can get an acting license

881
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:09,360
 within a few hours of being born.

882
00:29:09,360 --> 00:29:11,120
 In America, it takes about 15 days.

883
00:29:11,120 --> 00:29:13,600
 You've got to be 15 days old to get a worker's permit

884
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:14,720
 or acting. - How do you,

885
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:16,520
 do you need to audition?

886
00:29:16,520 --> 00:29:18,360
 Like, when you're coming out of the birth canal,

887
00:29:18,360 --> 00:29:20,440
 you're like, "Mary, come lie down."

888
00:29:20,440 --> 00:29:21,280
 - Exactly.

889
00:29:21,280 --> 00:29:22,120
 So that's the issue.

890
00:29:22,120 --> 00:29:23,640
 They say that often people complain,

891
00:29:23,640 --> 00:29:25,000
 like, "This baby's crying all the time."

892
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:26,560
 They say, "Well, you just happened to have

893
00:29:26,560 --> 00:29:27,720
 been given a crying baby."

894
00:29:27,720 --> 00:29:29,360
 Unfortunately, that's the case.

895
00:29:29,360 --> 00:29:31,800
 But they do have specifications that they like,

896
00:29:31,800 --> 00:29:35,920
 so triplets or twins are particularly liked,

897
00:29:35,920 --> 00:29:37,680
 because twins, most likely,

898
00:29:37,680 --> 00:29:39,160
 you're gonna be born three weeks early.

899
00:29:39,160 --> 00:29:42,360
 Triplets, in some cases, seven weeks early, right?

900
00:29:42,360 --> 00:29:43,400
 - Is that good?

901
00:29:43,400 --> 00:29:44,680
 - It's good. - I guess they'll be extra small

902
00:29:44,680 --> 00:29:46,640
 'cause they can get older and they can look newborn.

903
00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:47,480
 - Exactly.

904
00:29:47,480 --> 00:29:49,000
 - I actually thought it would be that

905
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:51,120
 they would only have to work for 20 minutes at a time

906
00:29:51,120 --> 00:29:52,720
 'cause you can keep swapping them in and out.

907
00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:54,080
 - That's the other reason.

908
00:29:54,080 --> 00:29:55,680
 So when they're looking for tiny babies,

909
00:29:55,680 --> 00:29:56,640
 twins are fantastic.

910
00:29:56,640 --> 00:29:58,240
 They're tiny, but you can do double time

911
00:29:58,240 --> 00:30:00,480
 because you've got two babies to swap in there.

912
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:02,560
 - Oh, babies look almost identical anyway.

913
00:30:02,560 --> 00:30:03,920
 - So you would think so, right?

914
00:30:03,920 --> 00:30:06,880
 But sometimes it's to do with hair and sometimes to do,

915
00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:08,720
 but yeah, so the youngest that this company said

916
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:11,120
 that they've ever handed over as a four-day-old baby

917
00:30:11,120 --> 00:30:12,720
 in order to be used.

918
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:13,560
 - Amazing.

919
00:30:13,560 --> 00:30:14,920
 - And so it's a great article

920
00:30:14,920 --> 00:30:16,280
 where it just tells you about different types

921
00:30:16,280 --> 00:30:18,320
 babies have been using and just a little nugget

922
00:30:18,320 --> 00:30:19,880
 for any Star Wars fans out there.

923
00:30:19,880 --> 00:30:21,400
 In Star Wars Revenge of the Sith,

924
00:30:21,400 --> 00:30:24,600
 we get to see Luke and Leia, who are twins that are born.

925
00:30:24,600 --> 00:30:26,680
 - Wait, that's episode three.

926
00:30:26,680 --> 00:30:27,720
 - Three, yeah.

927
00:30:27,720 --> 00:30:29,480
 - So you get to see them as babies

928
00:30:29,480 --> 00:30:31,400
 and that's where you learn that their brother and sister

929
00:30:31,400 --> 00:30:35,240
 in the series and the babies that were used for that

930
00:30:35,240 --> 00:30:39,120
 were actually one, which was a guy called Aidan Barton.

931
00:30:39,120 --> 00:30:41,440
 He plays both Luke and Leia.

932
00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:42,280
 - Really?

933
00:30:42,280 --> 00:30:43,120
 - So when you look at them--

934
00:30:43,120 --> 00:30:45,080
 - He's like, "Alex Guinness in kind hearts and coronets."

935
00:30:45,080 --> 00:30:46,200
 (laughing)

936
00:30:46,200 --> 00:30:49,040
 - Yeah, he's Eddie Murphy and then meet--

937
00:30:49,040 --> 00:30:50,400
 - What a reference to you to make James.

938
00:30:50,400 --> 00:30:52,320
 From somebody who hasn't seen any films made before

939
00:30:52,320 --> 00:30:54,680
 about 1987, for you to make a kind hearts and coronets

940
00:30:54,680 --> 00:30:56,240
 reference, what have you done with James?

941
00:30:56,240 --> 00:30:58,080
 - That's just somebody who does a lot of quizzes.

942
00:30:58,080 --> 00:31:00,280
 (laughing)

943
00:31:00,280 --> 00:31:02,080
 Sorry, yeah, I've not seen Star Wars.

944
00:31:02,080 --> 00:31:03,120
 What are you talking about?

945
00:31:03,120 --> 00:31:04,200
 - So-- - Twins.

946
00:31:04,200 --> 00:31:05,880
 - Also, can I, can I, quick, quick, sorry.

947
00:31:05,880 --> 00:31:06,840
 - No, no, no, no, I know what you're gonna say

948
00:31:06,840 --> 00:31:08,200
 and don't say it because we're going--

949
00:31:08,200 --> 00:31:09,200
 - The point of which you find out in the series

950
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:10,440
 that Luke and Leia are siblings.

951
00:31:10,440 --> 00:31:13,040
 - Yeah, if you start at episode one like a psychopath.

952
00:31:13,040 --> 00:31:14,200
 - James, where would you start?

953
00:31:14,200 --> 00:31:15,040
 - One.

954
00:31:15,040 --> 00:31:15,880
 - There we go.

955
00:31:15,880 --> 00:31:16,720
 When's he gonna find out?

956
00:31:16,720 --> 00:31:18,280
 - Come on, you've asked James the only person

957
00:31:18,280 --> 00:31:20,440
 who doesn't know when to start watching Star Wars

958
00:31:20,440 --> 00:31:22,200
 and I think that's an unfair sample.

959
00:31:22,200 --> 00:31:24,960
 - It's the first episode, there's a second episode

960
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:25,800
 that you find out.

961
00:31:25,800 --> 00:31:26,640
 - Presumably, they wouldn't have called

962
00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:27,680
 them episode one, two, and three

963
00:31:27,680 --> 00:31:29,680
 if they didn't want you to watch them first, would they?

964
00:31:29,680 --> 00:31:31,000
 - Absolutely, no, no, no.

965
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:32,680
 - It's absolutely correct.

966
00:31:32,680 --> 00:31:33,920
 Jabba the Hutt was actually played

967
00:31:33,920 --> 00:31:36,680
 by a six-week-old baby on that episode.

968
00:31:36,680 --> 00:31:38,020
 Very overfed.

969
00:31:38,020 --> 00:31:40,600
 (upbeat music)

970
00:31:40,600 --> 00:31:45,720
 Okay, it is time for fact number three

971
00:31:45,720 --> 00:31:46,980
 and that is my fact.

972
00:31:46,980 --> 00:31:49,500
 My fact this week is that there used to be a cinema

973
00:31:49,500 --> 00:31:51,920
 in Melbourne, Australia that had a cloakroom

974
00:31:51,920 --> 00:31:53,440
 to keep your babies in.

975
00:31:53,440 --> 00:31:54,760
 (laughing)

976
00:31:54,760 --> 00:31:55,800
 What?

977
00:31:55,800 --> 00:31:58,020
 So this was called the Sun Theater

978
00:31:58,020 --> 00:32:00,560
 and this was a place where when you were arriving

979
00:32:00,560 --> 00:32:02,180
 at the cinema, you would have a cloakroom

980
00:32:02,180 --> 00:32:03,740
 but rather than leaving your coat in there,

981
00:32:03,740 --> 00:32:06,960
 you would push your baby in its pram into the cloakroom,

982
00:32:06,960 --> 00:32:09,420
 be given a ticket, and then go watch the movie.

983
00:32:09,420 --> 00:32:11,180
 Now, obviously you don't want to completely abandon

984
00:32:11,180 --> 00:32:13,260
 your baby, so while you're watching the movie,

985
00:32:13,260 --> 00:32:15,780
 if your baby in the cloakroom kicks off

986
00:32:15,780 --> 00:32:17,820
 and starts crying inconsolably,

987
00:32:17,820 --> 00:32:20,240
 the ticket number that you hold will flash up

988
00:32:20,240 --> 00:32:22,260
 on the screen of the movie to let you know

989
00:32:22,260 --> 00:32:24,100
 that you're desperately needed in the cloakroom

990
00:32:24,100 --> 00:32:26,140
 so you can get out and look after your baby.

991
00:32:26,140 --> 00:32:26,980
 - It's very clever.

992
00:32:26,980 --> 00:32:27,820
 - Brilliant.

993
00:32:27,820 --> 00:32:29,740
 - Hang on, would it flash up for all the other members

994
00:32:29,740 --> 00:32:30,580
 of the audience?

995
00:32:30,580 --> 00:32:32,220
 Is it gonna replace the image that was on the screen

996
00:32:32,220 --> 00:32:34,020
 or is it a little thing in the corner that's subtle?

997
00:32:34,020 --> 00:32:36,500
 - Like, I think just a quick superimpose

998
00:32:36,500 --> 00:32:37,780
 at the number 29, whatever.

999
00:32:37,780 --> 00:32:39,120
 - Really, on the screen, mid-film?

1000
00:32:39,120 --> 00:32:39,960
 - I think that would be all right.

1001
00:32:39,960 --> 00:32:41,560
 - But be mid-film, I don't know if it would be

1002
00:32:41,560 --> 00:32:43,320
 directly over the whole thing, it might be in the corner.

1003
00:32:43,320 --> 00:32:44,800
 I couldn't actually find that out.

1004
00:32:44,800 --> 00:32:46,160
 - It's a must-be corner.

1005
00:32:46,160 --> 00:32:47,000
 - I don't know.

1006
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:48,080
 - I'll be so annoying 'cause babies cry constantly

1007
00:32:48,080 --> 00:32:51,480
 and if you've got 50 babies at a big blockbuster film

1008
00:32:51,480 --> 00:32:53,680
 in the cloakroom, you're just gonna be watching a series

1009
00:32:53,680 --> 00:32:55,520
 of numbers flashing up in the national lottery.

1010
00:32:55,520 --> 00:32:56,360
 - Exactly.

1011
00:32:56,360 --> 00:32:57,200
 (laughing)

1012
00:32:57,200 --> 00:32:58,040
 - So this--

1013
00:32:58,040 --> 00:32:58,880
 - It's ingenious.

1014
00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:00,160
 - It was a very clever idea and this was--

1015
00:33:00,160 --> 00:33:01,280
 - Why do we not have it today?

1016
00:33:01,280 --> 00:33:02,280
 - Exactly, why don't we?

1017
00:33:02,280 --> 00:33:03,120
 It seems like a very--

1018
00:33:03,120 --> 00:33:05,240
 - 'Cause people don't think they should just leave their babies.

1019
00:33:05,240 --> 00:33:06,760
 - Yeah, I don't think I'd leave my baby now

1020
00:33:06,760 --> 00:33:08,680
 that I say that out loud.

1021
00:33:08,680 --> 00:33:10,480
 - Well, your baby's probably in the movie.

1022
00:33:10,480 --> 00:33:12,800
 - That's right, it's in the movie, yeah.

1023
00:33:12,800 --> 00:33:14,000
 Well, you do have baby cinema now,

1024
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:15,680
 which we take my son to go and see.

1025
00:33:15,680 --> 00:33:16,520
 - Yeah, I got to that.

1026
00:33:16,520 --> 00:33:17,520
 - Yeah, we took--

1027
00:33:17,520 --> 00:33:19,720
 - You really should take your child along sometimes.

1028
00:33:19,720 --> 00:33:21,280
 - I know, I know.

1029
00:33:21,280 --> 00:33:23,280
 - The first movie that we took, "Wilf" to see,

1030
00:33:23,280 --> 00:33:25,800
 Fenella, my wife took "Wilf" to see was the movie

1031
00:33:25,800 --> 00:33:27,300
 that was on the biopic of Churchill

1032
00:33:27,300 --> 00:33:29,360
 that came out about four years back.

1033
00:33:29,360 --> 00:33:31,880
 - So all the babies look like Churchill.

1034
00:33:31,880 --> 00:33:33,320
 - Like "Wilf" was really into it

1035
00:33:33,320 --> 00:33:35,840
 'cause he was like, "Wow, it's me in a suit when I'm older."

1036
00:33:35,840 --> 00:33:37,880
 This is amazing.

1037
00:33:37,880 --> 00:33:41,440
 So the Sun Theater had opened up in Melbourne in 1938

1038
00:33:41,440 --> 00:33:42,960
 and it was a single screen theater.

1039
00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:46,560
 It had 1,050 seats and it was really massive.

1040
00:33:46,560 --> 00:33:48,920
 It was a big deal and then over time,

1041
00:33:48,920 --> 00:33:51,320
 people stopped going as much and they had to sell

1042
00:33:51,320 --> 00:33:54,240
 and new owners turned it into smaller screens.

1043
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:55,800
 So they stopped doing it.

1044
00:33:55,800 --> 00:33:58,800
 It's no longer a, you don't bring your Pram in there anymore,

1045
00:33:58,800 --> 00:34:00,120
 which is a shame.

1046
00:34:00,120 --> 00:34:02,080
 - And I can't find any other cinema that did this.

1047
00:34:02,080 --> 00:34:05,040
 - No, no, yeah. - I think it was just this one.

1048
00:34:05,040 --> 00:34:08,320
 - There are people who've left their children

1049
00:34:08,320 --> 00:34:09,600
 in cloak rooms before.

1050
00:34:09,600 --> 00:34:11,680
 I won't go so far as to say, "This is a thing,"

1051
00:34:11,680 --> 00:34:13,580
 because it's not.

1052
00:34:13,580 --> 00:34:15,860
 But in 1999, Tony Blair's chief of staff

1053
00:34:15,860 --> 00:34:17,840
 was a guy called Jonathan Powell and--

1054
00:34:17,840 --> 00:34:19,400
 - Oh, I remember Powell.

1055
00:34:19,400 --> 00:34:20,840
 Oh, those are the good old days, weren't they?

1056
00:34:20,840 --> 00:34:21,840
 - Friend of Anna.

1057
00:34:21,840 --> 00:34:24,740
 Anyway, he went to the Groucho Club

1058
00:34:24,740 --> 00:34:26,040
 and left his eight-week-old daughter

1059
00:34:26,040 --> 00:34:28,240
 with a cloakroom attendant and that was--

1060
00:34:28,240 --> 00:34:30,360
 And there was a brief comment about it

1061
00:34:30,360 --> 00:34:32,200
 and then the family complained saying,

1062
00:34:32,200 --> 00:34:33,560
 "The child has a right to a private life,"

1063
00:34:33,560 --> 00:34:34,640
 and I think the newspaper said,

1064
00:34:34,640 --> 00:34:36,160
 "Well, don't leave the child in the cloakroom then."

1065
00:34:36,160 --> 00:34:39,280
 Anyway, but the Observer sent a reporter

1066
00:34:39,280 --> 00:34:41,880
 called Saskia Sessons, who took a colleague of hers,

1067
00:34:41,880 --> 00:34:45,200
 five-month-old baby, to various cloakrooms all over London.

1068
00:34:45,200 --> 00:34:47,400
 It's a great feature.

1069
00:34:47,400 --> 00:34:49,920
 So King's Cross left luggage office?

1070
00:34:49,920 --> 00:34:50,880
 Absolutely not.

1071
00:34:50,880 --> 00:34:51,840
 The Ivy Restaurant?

1072
00:34:51,840 --> 00:34:54,160
 Yes, please leave the baby with us.

1073
00:34:54,160 --> 00:34:55,640
 We'll stash him on a ledge.

1074
00:34:55,640 --> 00:34:58,720
 National Gallery were incredibly rude to Saskia

1075
00:34:58,720 --> 00:35:00,200
 and her young friend.

1076
00:35:00,200 --> 00:35:02,040
 One of the cloakroom attendants said,

1077
00:35:02,040 --> 00:35:03,000
 "Out of the question."

1078
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:05,040
 The second said, "You need your head examined,"

1079
00:35:05,040 --> 00:35:07,880
 and the third said, "That's very, very irresponsible."

1080
00:35:07,880 --> 00:35:08,720
 - Get on, yeah. - I know.

1081
00:35:08,720 --> 00:35:10,520
 - So, wait a minute, that was all in the same--

1082
00:35:10,520 --> 00:35:11,360
 - That was all so close.

1083
00:35:11,360 --> 00:35:13,160
 - She keeps saying, "I want a second opinion."

1084
00:35:13,160 --> 00:35:15,120
 "I want a third opinion."

1085
00:35:15,120 --> 00:35:16,680
 - But restaurants seemed to be much more willing.

1086
00:35:16,680 --> 00:35:19,080
 The Oxo Tower Brasserie, which is a restaurant in London,

1087
00:35:19,080 --> 00:35:21,680
 said, "Yes, of course, please leave the baby with us."

1088
00:35:21,680 --> 00:35:23,040
 - I guess restaurants are smaller,

1089
00:35:23,040 --> 00:35:25,400
 so you can go to the parent if there's an issue,

1090
00:35:25,400 --> 00:35:26,600
 whereas National Gallery feel like

1091
00:35:26,600 --> 00:35:27,960
 you can lose the parent, right?

1092
00:35:27,960 --> 00:35:29,360
 - That's true, yeah.

1093
00:35:29,360 --> 00:35:31,440
 - One famous person left in the cloakroom

1094
00:35:31,440 --> 00:35:34,440
 is a character from Importance of Being Earnest,

1095
00:35:34,440 --> 00:35:37,640
 left in a handbag in the station.

1096
00:35:37,640 --> 00:35:41,440
 So I thought I'd look into that play by Oscar Wilde.

1097
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:44,800
 Yeah, so Oscar Wilde famously,

1098
00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:48,680
 could you tell I can't find anything else about cloakrooms?

1099
00:35:48,680 --> 00:35:53,320
 So he was famously brought up with charges of immorality,

1100
00:35:53,320 --> 00:35:55,520
 wasn't he, because he was homosexual.

1101
00:35:55,520 --> 00:35:57,480
 And in 1952, there was a movie,

1102
00:35:57,480 --> 00:35:59,720
 the first movie made of the Importance of Being Earnest,

1103
00:35:59,720 --> 00:36:03,200
 and it was directed by a guy called Anthony Asquith.

1104
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:06,680
 And Anthony Asquith was the son of Herbert Henry Asquith,

1105
00:36:06,680 --> 00:36:08,360
 who was home secretary,

1106
00:36:08,360 --> 00:36:11,120
 and he was the one who brought the charges of immorality

1107
00:36:11,120 --> 00:36:12,320
 against Oscar Wilde,

1108
00:36:12,320 --> 00:36:14,360
 which got him imprisoned in Reading jail.

1109
00:36:14,360 --> 00:36:15,200
 - That's interesting.

1110
00:36:15,200 --> 00:36:17,960
 - Yeah, and so he was the one who got him imprisoned,

1111
00:36:17,960 --> 00:36:20,600
 and then his son was the director of the movie.

1112
00:36:20,600 --> 00:36:21,440
 - That's really good.

1113
00:36:21,440 --> 00:36:22,600
 - You look great full circle.

1114
00:36:22,600 --> 00:36:25,040
 - I found some famous people who worked in cloakrooms.

1115
00:36:25,040 --> 00:36:25,860
 - Oh yeah, cool.

1116
00:36:25,860 --> 00:36:27,200
 - Mark Ormond.

1117
00:36:27,200 --> 00:36:28,960
 - Oh, from Soft Cell.

1118
00:36:28,960 --> 00:36:29,800
 - Soft Cell.

1119
00:36:29,800 --> 00:36:31,000
 - Of Tainted Love fame.

1120
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:32,880
 - Can I just ask, is that the most famous,

1121
00:36:32,880 --> 00:36:33,920
 and you're going to less and less?

1122
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:34,840
 'Cause I haven't heard of him,

1123
00:36:34,840 --> 00:36:36,280
 I'm gonna scratch off the dress.

1124
00:36:36,280 --> 00:36:37,360
 - Don't worry, I actually,

1125
00:36:37,360 --> 00:36:39,160
 I started with my weakest one.

1126
00:36:39,160 --> 00:36:40,000
 - Okay, great.

1127
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:40,880
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1128
00:36:40,880 --> 00:36:42,160
 Where did he work in the cloakroom?

1129
00:36:42,160 --> 00:36:43,000
 Sorry, did you solve?

1130
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:45,840
 - Probably at the front bit, where you take his clothes.

1131
00:36:45,840 --> 00:36:47,320
 - So he was high up in the role.

1132
00:36:47,320 --> 00:36:49,440
 - I didn't write it down, I'm sorry.

1133
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:50,560
 - Silla Black.

1134
00:36:50,560 --> 00:36:51,400
 - Yeah.

1135
00:36:51,400 --> 00:36:53,240
 - The cloakroom attendant at the cavern club.

1136
00:36:53,240 --> 00:36:54,320
 - Who else is on your list?

1137
00:36:54,320 --> 00:36:55,160
 - Boy George.

1138
00:36:55,160 --> 00:36:56,720
 - Boy George, yeah.

1139
00:36:56,720 --> 00:36:57,560
 - He, um.

1140
00:36:57,560 --> 00:36:58,880
 - At the culture club, wasn't it?

1141
00:36:58,880 --> 00:36:59,720
 (laughing)

1142
00:36:59,720 --> 00:37:01,040
 - Good, sorry.

1143
00:37:01,040 --> 00:37:02,760
 That's the band that Boy George was in.

1144
00:37:02,760 --> 00:37:04,240
 - Thank you, didn't get it yet.

1145
00:37:04,240 --> 00:37:06,480
 - Yeah, and Boy George is a singer in the band.

1146
00:37:06,480 --> 00:37:07,320
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1147
00:37:07,320 --> 00:37:09,000
 - Cool, I don't want to ruin every joke by asking,

1148
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:10,840
 so sometimes I'll just stay quiet and let it happen.

1149
00:37:10,840 --> 00:37:12,600
 - Karma Chameleon was the big hit.

1150
00:37:12,600 --> 00:37:14,360
 - That didn't help the joke.

1151
00:37:14,360 --> 00:37:16,680
 - No, just I'm just helping Anna understand who this is.

1152
00:37:16,680 --> 00:37:17,520
 - Good to learn.

1153
00:37:17,520 --> 00:37:18,360
 - He was interviewed about it later,

1154
00:37:18,360 --> 00:37:20,240
 and he said, "I was always rippling through pockets

1155
00:37:20,240 --> 00:37:23,000
 "and handbags, most people were too pissed to notice."

1156
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:24,000
 - Oh, yeah.

1157
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:25,680
 - Any babies in the handbags?

1158
00:37:25,680 --> 00:37:27,680
 - He didn't find the people.

1159
00:37:27,680 --> 00:37:28,680
 - Riffling, hey?

1160
00:37:28,680 --> 00:37:29,760
 - In my notes, I've got riffing,

1161
00:37:29,760 --> 00:37:31,200
 but that can't possibly be true.

1162
00:37:31,200 --> 00:37:33,440
 - No, I just would always say rifling.

1163
00:37:33,440 --> 00:37:35,640
 - That's better, then that is correct, yep.

1164
00:37:35,640 --> 00:37:37,560
 Sorry, yeah.

1165
00:37:37,560 --> 00:37:38,840
 - On cloakrooms.

1166
00:37:38,840 --> 00:37:40,160
 - Oh, yeah.

1167
00:37:40,160 --> 00:37:42,560
 - I read, so I think we've talked before about

1168
00:37:42,560 --> 00:37:46,240
 how popcorn wasn't really loud in cinemas until the third,

1169
00:37:46,240 --> 00:37:48,120
 and it was sort of post-depression, I think,

1170
00:37:48,120 --> 00:37:49,760
 when everyone was so depressed.

1171
00:37:49,760 --> 00:37:51,600
 They were like, "Let us have the popcorn."

1172
00:37:51,600 --> 00:37:54,040
 And also, yeah, the cinemas filled that.

1173
00:37:54,040 --> 00:37:55,320
 - They thought people would tread it

1174
00:37:55,320 --> 00:37:57,000
 into the nice carpets, didn't they?

1175
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:58,400
 - Well, before that, exactly.

1176
00:37:58,400 --> 00:37:59,720
 They thought people would tread it into the carpets.

1177
00:37:59,720 --> 00:38:00,560
 It was too noisy,

1178
00:38:00,560 --> 00:38:02,680
 and so you used to have to leave your popcorn in the cloakroom

1179
00:38:02,680 --> 00:38:06,400
 'cause people set up popcorn stands all outside cinemas,

1180
00:38:06,400 --> 00:38:07,960
 and they sell it to you, leaving the cloakroom.

1181
00:38:07,960 --> 00:38:10,080
 - That's amazing, just hand it in like a gun or something,

1182
00:38:10,080 --> 00:38:12,040
 and then you get it back afterwards.

1183
00:38:12,040 --> 00:38:14,200
 - You take a gun to the cinema?

1184
00:38:14,200 --> 00:38:16,280
 - No, sorry, I'm thinking of the thing in Old West.

1185
00:38:16,280 --> 00:38:17,760
 - Every time someone looks at their phone

1186
00:38:17,760 --> 00:38:18,760
 in the middle of a movie.

1187
00:38:18,760 --> 00:38:21,000
 (laughing)

1188
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:23,280
 - You got in a lot of trouble in your tour

1189
00:38:23,280 --> 00:38:25,920
 of some national gallery clothes, didn't you?

1190
00:38:25,920 --> 00:38:27,720
 Keep my AK-47.

1191
00:38:27,720 --> 00:38:29,280
 - Wasn't there a thing where you had to hand in your gun

1192
00:38:29,280 --> 00:38:31,480
 when you went to a Wild West bar?

1193
00:38:31,480 --> 00:38:33,840
 - Towns, like most of the Wild West towns

1194
00:38:33,840 --> 00:38:35,560
 wouldn't allow guns inside,

1195
00:38:35,560 --> 00:38:37,880
 so they would have a way to sort of stop, you know?

1196
00:38:37,880 --> 00:38:38,720
 - I think that's where--

1197
00:38:38,720 --> 00:38:40,360
 - Often you had them taken at the periphery

1198
00:38:40,360 --> 00:38:41,560
 of what we've talked about.

1199
00:38:41,560 --> 00:38:44,320
 - In fact, I think we said that in the OK Corral,

1200
00:38:44,320 --> 00:38:45,680
 problem was the reason it happened

1201
00:38:45,680 --> 00:38:46,960
 is 'cause they hadn't put their guns

1202
00:38:46,960 --> 00:38:48,480
 in the cloakroom before they arrived.

1203
00:38:48,480 --> 00:38:50,840
 - Exactly, that's what I'm thinking of.

1204
00:38:50,840 --> 00:38:52,720
 That's my incredibly convoluted part of that, you know?

1205
00:38:52,720 --> 00:38:54,840
 - Actually, speaking of weapons in cloakrooms,

1206
00:38:54,840 --> 00:38:57,520
 tell me something famous about the Houses of Parliament.

1207
00:38:57,520 --> 00:38:59,120
 - Oh yeah, the swords in the cloakroom.

1208
00:38:59,120 --> 00:39:01,280
 You've got a place for your swords.

1209
00:39:01,280 --> 00:39:03,360
 - There are hooks in the cloakroom

1210
00:39:03,360 --> 00:39:05,520
 so you can hang up your sword.

1211
00:39:05,520 --> 00:39:07,000
 - Yep, absolutely.

1212
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:09,240
 If you go into the Houses of Parliament cloakrooms,

1213
00:39:09,240 --> 00:39:12,560
 all the coat hangers have a loop of pink ribbon around them,

1214
00:39:12,560 --> 00:39:15,320
 and that is for holding your sword.

1215
00:39:15,320 --> 00:39:17,760
 So you're not allowed to sword in the chamber.

1216
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:22,400
 And I read a good expose of the fact that this,

1217
00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:23,640
 there's no evidence, this is true.

1218
00:39:23,640 --> 00:39:25,440
 So various reasons.

1219
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:28,560
 So in the massive fire in the 1830s,

1220
00:39:28,560 --> 00:39:29,640
 when everything was destroyed,

1221
00:39:29,640 --> 00:39:32,160
 that was way after anyone would ever bring swords in.

1222
00:39:32,160 --> 00:39:35,040
 And so it's weird that they would have the sword hooks.

1223
00:39:35,040 --> 00:39:36,560
 But even if they were for swords,

1224
00:39:36,560 --> 00:39:38,840
 the first mention that they were was 1928,

1225
00:39:38,840 --> 00:39:40,000
 and it was like an MP saying,

1226
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:41,080
 "Hey, they've got ribbons there."

1227
00:39:41,080 --> 00:39:43,720
 And that's from the olden days 'cause of the sword thing.

1228
00:39:43,720 --> 00:39:45,680
 And actually, all the mentions before that

1229
00:39:45,680 --> 00:39:48,440
 say they were for a much more sensible item.

1230
00:39:48,440 --> 00:39:49,280
 - Umbrella's.

1231
00:39:49,280 --> 00:39:51,280
 - Umbrella's.

1232
00:39:51,280 --> 00:39:52,240
 There you go.

1233
00:39:52,240 --> 00:39:55,360
 - I've got a bit of Australian cinema news

1234
00:39:55,360 --> 00:39:58,520
 just while we were talking about Aussie cinemas.

1235
00:39:58,520 --> 00:40:01,280
 Australia's longest running pornographic cinema

1236
00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:03,920
 is finally going to shut down.

1237
00:40:03,920 --> 00:40:04,880
 And according to the article,

1238
00:40:04,880 --> 00:40:06,480
 it's called the Crazy Horse Cinema.

1239
00:40:06,480 --> 00:40:07,880
 And according to the article,

1240
00:40:07,880 --> 00:40:09,720
 dozens of 90 year old pensioners

1241
00:40:09,720 --> 00:40:11,800
 are gonna be absolutely distraught

1242
00:40:11,800 --> 00:40:13,480
 'cause it's their meeting place.

1243
00:40:13,480 --> 00:40:16,480
 - There's a big group of 90.

1244
00:40:16,480 --> 00:40:18,200
 - What did she say?

1245
00:40:18,200 --> 00:40:20,000
 What's she doing?

1246
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:21,360
 She's gonna get a cold.

1247
00:40:21,360 --> 00:40:24,360
 He's not a real plumber.

1248
00:40:24,360 --> 00:40:26,600
 Sorry, what?

1249
00:40:26,600 --> 00:40:29,600
 - Yeah, this place has been open for many years.

1250
00:40:29,600 --> 00:40:32,440
 And supposedly it's a really good meeting ground

1251
00:40:32,440 --> 00:40:34,440
 for a lot of these 90 year old pensioners.

1252
00:40:34,440 --> 00:40:36,560
 So they all meet up there at 10 a.m.

1253
00:40:36,560 --> 00:40:39,720
 - Very early to start.

1254
00:40:39,720 --> 00:40:41,560
 - Very early.

1255
00:40:41,560 --> 00:40:43,000
 This comes from a quote from the lady.

1256
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:45,320
 They come and they do their thing in the morning.

1257
00:40:45,320 --> 00:40:46,160
 - Disgusting.

1258
00:40:46,160 --> 00:40:48,120
 (laughing)

1259
00:40:48,120 --> 00:40:51,520
 They come and then they have their meeting.

1260
00:40:51,520 --> 00:40:53,280
 - Yeah, they could come and do their thing in the morning,

1261
00:40:53,280 --> 00:40:54,400
 whatever that is they do.

1262
00:40:54,400 --> 00:40:56,800
 And then they go and maybe do some shopping for the wife

1263
00:40:56,800 --> 00:40:57,640
 and maybe have some lunch

1264
00:40:57,640 --> 00:40:58,720
 and then come back if they like.

1265
00:40:58,720 --> 00:40:59,560
 What they get is--

1266
00:40:59,560 --> 00:41:00,400
 - Oh, they sell mail pensioners.

1267
00:41:00,400 --> 00:41:01,240
 - It's mail pensioners

1268
00:41:01,240 --> 00:41:04,200
 and they get a $10 pensioner all day ticket

1269
00:41:04,200 --> 00:41:06,200
 to the porno cinema.

1270
00:41:06,200 --> 00:41:07,040
 - What?

1271
00:41:07,040 --> 00:41:08,200
 So sorry, when they're having this meeting,

1272
00:41:08,200 --> 00:41:09,040
 is it in the cinema?

1273
00:41:09,040 --> 00:41:10,680
 Why won't you film? - It's not really a meeting, is it?

1274
00:41:10,680 --> 00:41:12,080
 It's sort of like a gathering.

1275
00:41:12,080 --> 00:41:13,960
 - I even think as a teenager,

1276
00:41:13,960 --> 00:41:15,400
 I would be able to get my money's worth

1277
00:41:15,400 --> 00:41:18,280
 from an old day ticket on a graphic cinema.

1278
00:41:18,280 --> 00:41:19,120
 (laughing)

1279
00:41:19,120 --> 00:41:19,960
 It's a pensioner.

1280
00:41:19,960 --> 00:41:21,800
 - For angry sales in Australia.

1281
00:41:21,800 --> 00:41:24,040
 (laughing)

1282
00:41:24,040 --> 00:41:24,880
 - That's so funny.

1283
00:41:24,880 --> 00:41:26,920
 - Yeah, so these guys, these nine-year-olds

1284
00:41:26,920 --> 00:41:27,840
 have been going for 20 years.

1285
00:41:27,840 --> 00:41:31,400
 So, you know, they were a fruity, fresh 70-year-olds

1286
00:41:31,400 --> 00:41:32,240
 at the time.

1287
00:41:32,240 --> 00:41:35,400
 And yeah, and then obviously--

1288
00:41:35,400 --> 00:41:36,400
 - These lads are gonna be thrilled

1289
00:41:36,400 --> 00:41:38,320
 when they find out about the internet.

1290
00:41:38,320 --> 00:41:40,560
 (laughing)

1291
00:41:41,400 --> 00:41:44,360
 - Yeah, that's, you know, so they're distraught

1292
00:41:44,360 --> 00:41:45,200
 at the moment.

1293
00:41:45,200 --> 00:41:46,040
 And it's closing this year.

1294
00:41:46,040 --> 00:41:47,760
 This is from this year, this article.

1295
00:41:47,760 --> 00:41:50,400
 - Good, but crazy, the crazy boys.

1296
00:41:50,400 --> 00:41:53,200
 - Knock it down, so the ground with salt.

1297
00:41:53,200 --> 00:41:54,040
 - I don't know.

1298
00:41:54,040 --> 00:41:55,040
 It keeps them out for the full day,

1299
00:41:55,040 --> 00:41:56,680
 which is judging by the sounds of these men.

1300
00:41:56,680 --> 00:41:57,520
 Sounds like some of the boys.

1301
00:41:57,520 --> 00:41:58,360
 - That's the poor idea, yeah.

1302
00:41:58,360 --> 00:41:59,200
 - Yeah.

1303
00:41:59,200 --> 00:42:00,040
 - Is popcorn allowed?

1304
00:42:00,040 --> 00:42:01,120
 - Um, as a matter of the cup,

1305
00:42:01,120 --> 00:42:02,960
 it's got bigger concerns, actually.

1306
00:42:02,960 --> 00:42:03,800
 (laughing)

1307
00:42:03,800 --> 00:42:06,380
 (upbeat music)

1308
00:42:09,040 --> 00:42:12,040
 - Okay, it is time for our final fact of the show,

1309
00:42:12,040 --> 00:42:14,000
 and that is Anna.

1310
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:17,280
 - My fact this week is that the original vapes

1311
00:42:17,280 --> 00:42:19,000
 were Pez dispensers.

1312
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:21,280
 (laughing)

1313
00:42:21,280 --> 00:42:24,580
 So, you know, for people in the UK who maybe don't,

1314
00:42:24,580 --> 00:42:27,240
 Pez dispensers are like those sweet holders.

1315
00:42:27,240 --> 00:42:29,240
 They're a huge deal in America, right?

1316
00:42:29,240 --> 00:42:31,680
 They're kind of tubes that hold sweets,

1317
00:42:31,680 --> 00:42:32,640
 and they have a funny head on top.

1318
00:42:32,640 --> 00:42:33,880
 - Well, yeah, so you got a little funny head,

1319
00:42:33,880 --> 00:42:35,600
 and you tip the head back,

1320
00:42:35,600 --> 00:42:39,520
 and it's like an elevator system where the latest sweet

1321
00:42:39,520 --> 00:42:41,360
 that's sitting on top arrives at the top,

1322
00:42:41,360 --> 00:42:43,040
 bing, and you get to pull it out,

1323
00:42:43,040 --> 00:42:46,320
 and it's a little rectangular sweetie.

1324
00:42:46,320 --> 00:42:47,880
 - Like a brick, but much smaller.

1325
00:42:47,880 --> 00:42:49,680
 - Exactly, like a tiny brick built.

1326
00:42:49,680 --> 00:42:51,260
 - Yeah, if you were building a house for an else.

1327
00:42:51,260 --> 00:42:53,200
 - Imagine if you were building a house,

1328
00:42:53,200 --> 00:42:54,240
 but you had an elevator,

1329
00:42:54,240 --> 00:42:56,160
 and every time you needed to put a brick on,

1330
00:42:56,160 --> 00:42:58,160
 the brick had to come up in an elevator.

1331
00:42:58,160 --> 00:42:59,000
 - Yeah.

1332
00:42:59,000 --> 00:42:59,840
 - And then it would come out.

1333
00:42:59,840 --> 00:43:01,480
 - Well, this is a classically helpful,

1334
00:43:01,480 --> 00:43:03,440
 no such thing as a fishing explainer.

1335
00:43:03,440 --> 00:43:04,280
 - The lucky thing is,

1336
00:43:04,280 --> 00:43:06,040
 everyone knows one of Pez,

1337
00:43:06,040 --> 00:43:07,360
 (all laughing)

1338
00:43:07,360 --> 00:43:08,920
 - That was a waste of your time in ours.

1339
00:43:08,920 --> 00:43:11,540
 - Yeah, it's, yeah, and you,

1340
00:43:11,540 --> 00:43:13,200
 - Are you gonna, so you're gonna try as well now?

1341
00:43:13,200 --> 00:43:16,080
 - I think of them as kind of confectionary staplers,

1342
00:43:16,080 --> 00:43:18,120
 'cause you have to load it in cartilage with sweets,

1343
00:43:18,120 --> 00:43:19,880
 don't you, and you like some staples.

1344
00:43:19,880 --> 00:43:22,080
 - That's actually the best simile that we've had so far.

1345
00:43:22,080 --> 00:43:23,200
 - That was actually really good, yeah.

1346
00:43:23,200 --> 00:43:24,040
 - We'll allow it.

1347
00:43:24,040 --> 00:43:28,680
 Anyway, Pez sweets were created in 1927 in Vienna.

1348
00:43:28,680 --> 00:43:30,000
 - And people smoke them.

1349
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:33,040
 - And people load them into their cigarettes.

1350
00:43:33,040 --> 00:43:34,080
 No, but they were created

1351
00:43:34,080 --> 00:43:36,320
 by a guy called Edward Haas III,

1352
00:43:36,320 --> 00:43:38,400
 and he was an anti-smoking campaigner,

1353
00:43:38,400 --> 00:43:39,680
 thought it was bad for your health,

1354
00:43:39,680 --> 00:43:41,360
 well done, very forward-thinking of him,

1355
00:43:41,360 --> 00:43:43,200
 and he wanted to create a tablet

1356
00:43:43,200 --> 00:43:47,000
 that helped people to cut down on smoking or overeating.

1357
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:49,800
 And so they were these mint tablets,

1358
00:43:49,800 --> 00:43:51,720
 and that was what they were explicitly for.

1359
00:43:51,720 --> 00:43:55,400
 Early advert said, "No smoking, pezzing allowed."

1360
00:43:55,400 --> 00:43:56,520
 Like vaping.

1361
00:43:56,520 --> 00:43:59,360
 And then when the dispensers came about in the '50s,

1362
00:43:59,360 --> 00:44:01,440
 they are sort of, well, the first ones were shaped

1363
00:44:01,440 --> 00:44:03,400
 so like really like cigarette lighters,

1364
00:44:03,400 --> 00:44:07,120
 and they were for adults, marketed very much for adults.

1365
00:44:07,120 --> 00:44:09,640
 - And they used to send women in sort of like

1366
00:44:09,640 --> 00:44:13,680
 quite cleavage-heavy dresses around in vans.

1367
00:44:13,680 --> 00:44:14,520
 - Cleavage-heavy.

1368
00:44:14,520 --> 00:44:15,680
 - Low putts, we call them.

1369
00:44:15,680 --> 00:44:17,880
 - Yeah, cleavage-heavy, not all right.

1370
00:44:17,880 --> 00:44:19,840
 I guess we're wearing a very cleavage-heavy top tonight.

1371
00:44:19,840 --> 00:44:21,680
 It's a cut.

1372
00:44:21,680 --> 00:44:24,760
 Your saucy fashion show, the descriptions are not good.

1373
00:44:24,760 --> 00:44:28,320
 - They said they do look a bit like lighters,

1374
00:44:28,320 --> 00:44:30,040
 but according to Sean Peterson,

1375
00:44:30,040 --> 00:44:33,360
 who's the historian at Pez Candy, incorporated,

1376
00:44:33,360 --> 00:44:36,200
 they were only designed that way to fit into pockets.

1377
00:44:36,200 --> 00:44:38,400
 It's just a coincidence that they look like lighters

1378
00:44:38,400 --> 00:44:40,880
 'cause lighters are also designed to go into pockets.

1379
00:44:40,880 --> 00:44:43,840
 - Yeah, I did hear that Pez Candy,

1380
00:44:43,840 --> 00:44:46,040
 incorporated does have an official historian, I thought.

1381
00:44:46,040 --> 00:44:46,960
 - Sean Peterson.

1382
00:44:46,960 --> 00:44:50,040
 - It's a very light historian gig,

1383
00:44:50,040 --> 00:44:52,360
 as in it's a very, very small area of history.

1384
00:44:52,360 --> 00:44:54,280
 - I reckon he does other stuff.

1385
00:44:54,280 --> 00:44:55,120
 - You'd have to.

1386
00:44:55,120 --> 00:44:57,760
 - I think usually the historians in these kind of companies

1387
00:44:57,760 --> 00:44:59,440
 are actually someone who does another job,

1388
00:44:59,440 --> 00:45:01,400
 but in their spare time, they kind of--

1389
00:45:01,400 --> 00:45:02,240
 - I'm sure you're right,

1390
00:45:02,240 --> 00:45:03,680
 because otherwise you'd feel like a fool

1391
00:45:03,680 --> 00:45:05,200
 turning up at a historian's conference.

1392
00:45:05,200 --> 00:45:06,080
 They'd be like, "What do you study?"

1393
00:45:06,080 --> 00:45:08,120
 "Oh, the 19th century mostly, what about you?"

1394
00:45:08,120 --> 00:45:09,840
 (laughing)

1395
00:45:09,840 --> 00:45:11,880
 - You sat next to Mary Beard on one side

1396
00:45:11,880 --> 00:45:13,440
 and Dan Snow on the other side.

1397
00:45:13,440 --> 00:45:16,080
 (laughing)

1398
00:45:16,080 --> 00:45:18,240
 - But yeah, it was until they came to America

1399
00:45:18,240 --> 00:45:20,720
 that they still, even when the dispensers were added,

1400
00:45:20,720 --> 00:45:22,440
 this was a way to give up smoking.

1401
00:45:22,440 --> 00:45:24,480
 And apparently it was only when they went to America

1402
00:45:24,480 --> 00:45:26,520
 in the '50s and tried to market them there

1403
00:45:26,520 --> 00:45:27,760
 and they were targeting adults,

1404
00:45:27,760 --> 00:45:29,240
 kids how to quit smoking.

1405
00:45:29,240 --> 00:45:31,200
 America didn't have the same appetite to quit smoking.

1406
00:45:31,200 --> 00:45:32,960
 I think maybe there wasn't such a campaign back then

1407
00:45:32,960 --> 00:45:35,640
 as there was in Austria, saying this is bad.

1408
00:45:35,640 --> 00:45:38,160
 And so they thought, let's start putting fun,

1409
00:45:38,160 --> 00:45:39,400
 turning them into fun kid shapes

1410
00:45:39,400 --> 00:45:40,480
 and marketing them to children.

1411
00:45:40,480 --> 00:45:42,240
 - Yeah, and changing the taste, obviously,

1412
00:45:42,240 --> 00:45:45,600
 of the thing from a sort of anti-smoking nicotine--

1413
00:45:45,600 --> 00:45:47,280
 - Well, they wasn't just peppermint.

1414
00:45:47,280 --> 00:45:49,800
 - No, no, but as in they changed it to sweeties.

1415
00:45:49,800 --> 00:45:50,640
 They made this.

1416
00:45:50,640 --> 00:45:51,760
 - But they were always minty.

1417
00:45:51,760 --> 00:45:53,040
 - They were always minty on the start.

1418
00:45:53,040 --> 00:45:54,200
 - 'Cause that's where the name comes from.

1419
00:45:54,200 --> 00:45:56,120
 It comes from the German for peppermint.

1420
00:45:56,120 --> 00:45:56,960
 - Oh, yeah.

1421
00:45:56,960 --> 00:46:00,360
 - Weirdly, one of the first flavors they had was chlorophyll.

1422
00:46:00,360 --> 00:46:01,200
 - Yeah.

1423
00:46:01,200 --> 00:46:02,040
 - What?

1424
00:46:02,040 --> 00:46:02,880
 - So what is that?

1425
00:46:02,880 --> 00:46:04,800
 - It's the green stuff you get in leaves.

1426
00:46:04,800 --> 00:46:06,400
 - It's hard to know what it tastes like.

1427
00:46:06,400 --> 00:46:07,240
 - Exactly.

1428
00:46:07,240 --> 00:46:08,080
 - I've never thought of it as anything.

1429
00:46:08,080 --> 00:46:09,200
 - It tastes like grass, I reckon.

1430
00:46:09,200 --> 00:46:12,760
 - I would imagine so too, but it's such a weird flavor.

1431
00:46:12,760 --> 00:46:15,560
 Can we talk about Edouard Haas, the third?

1432
00:46:15,560 --> 00:46:16,400
 - Haas, yes.

1433
00:46:16,400 --> 00:46:17,800
 - So it's a really interesting family,

1434
00:46:17,800 --> 00:46:21,080
 because his father, Edward Haas the second,

1435
00:46:21,080 --> 00:46:23,160
 was a baked goods merchant.

1436
00:46:23,160 --> 00:46:24,720
 Okay, so it's all baking powder.

1437
00:46:24,720 --> 00:46:27,000
 And his father, Edward Haas--

1438
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:28,560
 - It's not actually a baked good, is it?

1439
00:46:28,560 --> 00:46:30,360
 - It's a good for baking.

1440
00:46:30,360 --> 00:46:31,880
 - What a good point, it's a baking goods.

1441
00:46:31,880 --> 00:46:33,200
 Yeah, yeah, sorry, I stand corrected.

1442
00:46:33,200 --> 00:46:38,200
 Okay, but basically, Edward the third

1443
00:46:38,200 --> 00:46:41,040
 seems to have invented the first ready-made cake mixture.

1444
00:46:41,040 --> 00:46:41,880
 It's a huge deal.

1445
00:46:41,880 --> 00:46:44,440
 - So wait a minute, was this the one who did Paz,

1446
00:46:44,440 --> 00:46:45,280
 or is this--

1447
00:46:45,280 --> 00:46:46,600
 - The one who did Paz, the third, yeah.

1448
00:46:46,600 --> 00:46:48,280
 Edward the third is the guy who did Hassan

1449
00:46:48,280 --> 00:46:50,720
 for the baking of health sponge cakes.

1450
00:46:50,720 --> 00:46:55,160
 Edward's grandfather, Edward Haas the first, okay.

1451
00:46:55,160 --> 00:46:56,960
 I've read one reference to this.

1452
00:46:56,960 --> 00:46:58,720
 "I cannot find any more detail anywhere,

1453
00:46:58,720 --> 00:47:01,160
 "but there's a source online which claims that he died

1454
00:47:01,160 --> 00:47:04,400
 "as a result of medical experiments he did on himself."

1455
00:47:04,400 --> 00:47:07,320
 There's no further evidence that I found.

1456
00:47:07,320 --> 00:47:10,720
 So if you know, please write in and enlighten us,

1457
00:47:10,720 --> 00:47:15,120
 because it's not clear what he was doing to himself.

1458
00:47:15,120 --> 00:47:17,040
 - They're in the baking industry, what could he have done?

1459
00:47:17,040 --> 00:47:20,120
 He added too much bicarbonate soda to himself.

1460
00:47:20,120 --> 00:47:21,680
 - He wanted to know how hot to bake things,

1461
00:47:21,680 --> 00:47:23,200
 so he tested the temperature himself.

1462
00:47:23,200 --> 00:47:24,040
 - Sat in the oven.

1463
00:47:24,040 --> 00:47:25,720
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1464
00:47:25,720 --> 00:47:26,840
 I mean, he cut a hole in his neck

1465
00:47:26,840 --> 00:47:28,360
 so he could dispense loads of bread

1466
00:47:28,360 --> 00:47:29,520
 when he took his head back.

1467
00:47:29,520 --> 00:47:30,760
 (laughing)

1468
00:47:30,760 --> 00:47:32,840
 - It's so unclear what he did.

1469
00:47:32,840 --> 00:47:35,200
 There's no further detail, so mystery.

1470
00:47:35,200 --> 00:47:38,520
 - So the evolution of the Paz dispenser itself

1471
00:47:38,520 --> 00:47:40,760
 is very exciting, you know.

1472
00:47:40,760 --> 00:47:44,520
 Poor Haas the third didn't get to see the feet

1473
00:47:44,520 --> 00:47:46,960
 that were added to the bottom of a Paz dispenser

1474
00:47:46,960 --> 00:47:48,560
 to allow it to stand.

1475
00:47:48,560 --> 00:47:49,600
 That was a big innovation.

1476
00:47:49,600 --> 00:47:51,880
 It's the Paz we know and love.

1477
00:47:51,880 --> 00:47:53,680
 - That was 1987, I believe, wasn't it?

1478
00:47:53,680 --> 00:47:54,600
 - That was in '87.

1479
00:47:54,600 --> 00:47:56,120
 - And they had weird designs before it.

1480
00:47:56,120 --> 00:47:59,160
 So before they added the feet, there was one in 1956,

1481
00:47:59,160 --> 00:48:02,160
 they invented a sort of space gun.

1482
00:48:02,160 --> 00:48:04,760
 And also, from what I've seen, regular looking guns.

1483
00:48:04,760 --> 00:48:07,880
 So the idea is that the gun would shoot out.

1484
00:48:07,880 --> 00:48:10,680
 It's like a pistol would shoot out the Paz at the end

1485
00:48:10,680 --> 00:48:11,760
 into your mouth.

1486
00:48:11,760 --> 00:48:14,800
 - Of course, you have to put the gun in your mouth.

1487
00:48:14,800 --> 00:48:17,080
 - It doesn't seem like.

1488
00:48:17,080 --> 00:48:19,000
 - The guy who set up the Paz dispenser,

1489
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:20,680
 as we know it, is a guy, well,

1490
00:48:20,680 --> 00:48:22,280
 the guy who was in charge of the decision, basically,

1491
00:48:22,280 --> 00:48:24,400
 was a man called Curtis Alina,

1492
00:48:24,400 --> 00:48:27,600
 who was a European.

1493
00:48:27,600 --> 00:48:30,160
 He was born in Prague in 1922.

1494
00:48:30,160 --> 00:48:33,400
 He was Jewish and that was not a good time

1495
00:48:33,400 --> 00:48:35,880
 to be born Jewish in Central Europe in Prague.

1496
00:48:35,880 --> 00:48:38,080
 His family were all sent to concentration camps.

1497
00:48:38,080 --> 00:48:40,040
 He was the only surviving member of his family

1498
00:48:40,040 --> 00:48:41,800
 in Europe after the war.

1499
00:48:41,800 --> 00:48:46,800
 He went to the USA and he started working for Paz.

1500
00:48:46,800 --> 00:48:49,640
 But the US and the European Paz

1501
00:48:49,640 --> 00:48:51,120
 were kind of two different camps.

1502
00:48:51,120 --> 00:48:53,800
 They were quite remote from each other.

1503
00:48:53,800 --> 00:48:55,040
 They weren't really tied together

1504
00:48:55,040 --> 00:48:57,160
 and he had to persuade the Viennese outfit.

1505
00:48:57,160 --> 00:48:59,200
 They wanted serious sober grown-up mints,

1506
00:48:59,200 --> 00:49:00,960
 you know, adult mints,

1507
00:49:00,960 --> 00:49:03,360
 that this dispenser thing was a good idea.

1508
00:49:03,360 --> 00:49:04,520
 But I just, I mention all of this

1509
00:49:04,520 --> 00:49:06,680
 because there's a weird link to Sigmund Freud,

1510
00:49:06,680 --> 00:49:08,440
 who was from Vienna.

1511
00:49:08,440 --> 00:49:11,600
 - Okay, I'm gonna copy the old James Harkinville circle here.

1512
00:49:11,600 --> 00:49:14,400
 - But the link is not just that they're both in Vienna.

1513
00:49:14,400 --> 00:49:16,200
 - Well, he lived across the street from Sigmund Freud

1514
00:49:16,200 --> 00:49:18,160
 when he was a boy, supposedly.

1515
00:49:18,160 --> 00:49:19,600
 And there was this brilliant website I found

1516
00:49:19,600 --> 00:49:21,400
 which is called Freud's Butcher.com,

1517
00:49:21,400 --> 00:49:23,360
 which is about the history of Sigmund Freud

1518
00:49:23,360 --> 00:49:24,920
 by an author called E.D. Jarrellim.

1519
00:49:24,920 --> 00:49:25,760
 She's great.

1520
00:49:25,760 --> 00:49:28,880
 It's a blog about genealogy, psychology and meat, okay?

1521
00:49:28,880 --> 00:49:32,920
 And there's a theory that she posits

1522
00:49:32,920 --> 00:49:37,200
 that Edward Haas III might have been considering

1523
00:49:37,200 --> 00:49:39,720
 Freud's theory of oral fixation

1524
00:49:39,720 --> 00:49:40,960
 when he came up with the idea

1525
00:49:40,960 --> 00:49:43,240
 of substituting peppermint sweets for cigarettes.

1526
00:49:43,240 --> 00:49:44,080
 - Oh, I see.

1527
00:49:44,080 --> 00:49:47,120
 Not that the Paz dispenser looks a bit like a penis.

1528
00:49:47,120 --> 00:49:48,840
 - No, that's not.

1529
00:49:48,840 --> 00:49:51,880
 Although that's an excellent evolution of the theory.

1530
00:49:51,880 --> 00:49:54,160
 Maybe he was only thinking about it subconsciously,

1531
00:49:54,160 --> 00:49:58,160
 but wouldn't that be appropriate given that it's Freud?

1532
00:49:58,160 --> 00:49:59,000
 - Yeah?

1533
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:01,640
 - What a load of absolute balls.

1534
00:50:01,640 --> 00:50:03,520
 Oh, he happened to live in opposite Freud.

1535
00:50:03,520 --> 00:50:07,200
 What weird convoluted thing can we attribute to that?

1536
00:50:07,200 --> 00:50:08,040
 - Are you right?

1537
00:50:08,040 --> 00:50:10,320
 She says it's a huge stretch.

1538
00:50:10,320 --> 00:50:11,360
 - She says that as well.

1539
00:50:11,360 --> 00:50:12,200
 - She also says that.

1540
00:50:12,200 --> 00:50:13,480
 - Okay, I disagree.

1541
00:50:13,480 --> 00:50:17,120
 - So have you guys come across Steve Gloo?

1542
00:50:17,120 --> 00:50:18,240
 - Oh, no.

1543
00:50:18,240 --> 00:50:19,400
 - The Paz Outlaw.

1544
00:50:19,400 --> 00:50:21,960
 - The Paz Outlaw, self-styled.

1545
00:50:21,960 --> 00:50:24,600
 - I can't believe I genuinely got like a tingle of goosebumps.

1546
00:50:24,600 --> 00:50:26,240
 You both got excited by that.

1547
00:50:26,240 --> 00:50:27,480
 Who's Steve Gloo?

1548
00:50:27,480 --> 00:50:31,280
 - He is basically the king of collecting pezzas.

1549
00:50:31,280 --> 00:50:32,920
 So he would go to Europe

1550
00:50:32,920 --> 00:50:36,120
 and he would get all of these really, really rare pezzas,

1551
00:50:36,120 --> 00:50:37,920
 sometimes digging through garbage

1552
00:50:37,920 --> 00:50:40,320
 to try and get ones which had been thrown out.

1553
00:50:40,320 --> 00:50:42,000
 And then he would take them back to America

1554
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:45,400
 and he would sell them to Paz enthusiasts.

1555
00:50:45,400 --> 00:50:48,920
 And he said at one stage he was making $4.5 million.

1556
00:50:48,920 --> 00:50:52,760
 He made that much in total selling pez candy dispensers

1557
00:50:52,760 --> 00:50:55,960
 that he'd taken from Eastern Europe and sold in America.

1558
00:50:55,960 --> 00:50:57,840
 - And it seemed to be there was some kind of loophole

1559
00:50:57,840 --> 00:50:59,840
 in terms of importing them or...

1560
00:50:59,840 --> 00:51:02,080
 - Well, he just sort of snuck through customs

1561
00:51:02,080 --> 00:51:03,120
 quite a lot with them.

1562
00:51:03,120 --> 00:51:06,000
 And it was, honestly, so this is where I first...

1563
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:07,680
 - Where was he hiding them?

1564
00:51:07,680 --> 00:51:10,320
 - I think often they didn't check.

1565
00:51:10,320 --> 00:51:13,440
 - It's just the right shape.

1566
00:51:13,440 --> 00:51:15,720
 That's why they're shaped like that.

1567
00:51:15,720 --> 00:51:17,160
 - It wasn't one per trip.

1568
00:51:17,160 --> 00:51:19,520
 - I don't think that would have been profitable.

1569
00:51:19,520 --> 00:51:22,320
 - Just a little Mickey Mouse head sticking out his rectum.

1570
00:51:22,320 --> 00:51:25,960
 - Help yourself to one more year down there.

1571
00:51:25,960 --> 00:51:29,280
 - Yeah, this is how I came across this fact initially.

1572
00:51:29,280 --> 00:51:31,480
 I was reading a review of "The Pez Outlaw"

1573
00:51:31,480 --> 00:51:33,280
 which is coming out this year, I think.

1574
00:51:33,280 --> 00:51:35,240
 And it's the film based on his adventures.

1575
00:51:35,240 --> 00:51:37,720
 And it sounds proper exciting stuff.

1576
00:51:37,720 --> 00:51:40,440
 It was him and his son who's an equally avid collector.

1577
00:51:40,440 --> 00:51:42,120
 And he was real down and out.

1578
00:51:42,120 --> 00:51:44,320
 Like wasn't making any money until he came across

1579
00:51:44,320 --> 00:51:46,680
 this big scam where he'd fly to Eastern Europe,

1580
00:51:46,680 --> 00:51:49,760
 go into factories and basically bribe factory workers

1581
00:51:49,760 --> 00:51:51,200
 to give him a bunch of pez he knew

1582
00:51:51,200 --> 00:51:52,960
 would be incredibly valuable.

1583
00:51:52,960 --> 00:51:55,840
 But they drive around in this truck.

1584
00:51:55,840 --> 00:51:58,840
 Apparently his son said he'd drive 24 hours straight.

1585
00:51:58,840 --> 00:52:02,120
 He'd be so tired that he often crashed the truck

1586
00:52:02,120 --> 00:52:04,480
 but just kept plugging away.

1587
00:52:04,480 --> 00:52:09,000
 And he had this amazing rival called Patek

1588
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:14,000
 who was another Pez guy who also got first dibs

1589
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:16,320
 in the factories and flogged pez.

1590
00:52:16,320 --> 00:52:19,440
 And apparently at one point glue pursued Patek

1591
00:52:19,440 --> 00:52:21,600
 across Austria in a car chase.

1592
00:52:21,600 --> 00:52:24,240
 And I said that they like drove on pavements.

1593
00:52:24,240 --> 00:52:25,880
 They were on the wrong side of the road.

1594
00:52:25,880 --> 00:52:28,080
 They had to bribe police with Pez dispensers

1595
00:52:28,080 --> 00:52:29,500
 full of cash he played.

1596
00:52:29,500 --> 00:52:31,480
 (laughing)

1597
00:52:31,480 --> 00:52:34,680
 - It could only be tiny little son teams.

1598
00:52:34,680 --> 00:52:36,080
 - They went with notes apparently.

1599
00:52:36,080 --> 00:52:37,800
 I don't know how many notes you can fit in.

1600
00:52:37,800 --> 00:52:39,600
 A couple of hundred dollar bills maybe.

1601
00:52:39,600 --> 00:52:42,160
 - But then of course big Pez got involved, right?

1602
00:52:42,160 --> 00:52:43,000
 - Big Pez?

1603
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:45,800
 - And so this guy decided he sort of

1604
00:52:45,800 --> 00:52:47,840
 did a little bit of a deal with a guy in Hungary

1605
00:52:47,840 --> 00:52:50,960
 and said that this guy would make extras for him.

1606
00:52:50,960 --> 00:52:53,540
 And they would discontinued ones as well sometimes.

1607
00:52:53,540 --> 00:52:56,260
 So they'd be really, really good expensive,

1608
00:52:56,260 --> 00:52:57,720
 you know, rare Pezes.

1609
00:52:57,720 --> 00:52:59,600
 This guy in Hungary would make them for him

1610
00:52:59,600 --> 00:53:00,840
 and he would buy loads of them

1611
00:53:00,840 --> 00:53:03,240
 and then take them back to America and sell them.

1612
00:53:03,240 --> 00:53:05,920
 But one day he logged into the Pez website

1613
00:53:05,920 --> 00:53:08,920
 and he found a new section called misfit dispensers.

1614
00:53:08,920 --> 00:53:10,640
 And it was all the ones that he'd bought

1615
00:53:10,640 --> 00:53:12,040
 from this guy in Hungary,

1616
00:53:12,040 --> 00:53:15,000
 but Pez was selling them for like a dollar each.

1617
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:17,840
 And they basically just flooded the market

1618
00:53:17,840 --> 00:53:19,680
 with other ones.

1619
00:53:19,680 --> 00:53:24,680
 And he reckons that it left him $250,000 in debt.

1620
00:53:24,680 --> 00:53:26,240
 This one trick.

1621
00:53:26,240 --> 00:53:29,280
 And when he rang up this broker in Hungary and said,

1622
00:53:29,280 --> 00:53:31,120
 "What's happened? Why are they doing this?"

1623
00:53:31,120 --> 00:53:33,160
 The broker said, "The right hand knows

1624
00:53:33,160 --> 00:53:35,300
 what the left is doing."

1625
00:53:35,300 --> 00:53:37,360
 So basically it was all a scam.

1626
00:53:37,360 --> 00:53:39,360
 They just basically fitted him up.

1627
00:53:39,360 --> 00:53:41,120
 - That's extraordinary.

1628
00:53:41,120 --> 00:53:43,880
 - So the dispenser was made by someone called Oscar.

1629
00:53:44,100 --> 00:53:46,400
 (speaks in foreign language)

1630
00:53:46,400 --> 00:53:50,240
 And his patent actually said that it would be helpful

1631
00:53:50,240 --> 00:53:52,840
 for people who have only one hand.

1632
00:53:52,840 --> 00:53:55,560
 So it was a way of dispensing sweets from a box,

1633
00:53:55,560 --> 00:53:57,920
 but you only need one hand to do it.

1634
00:53:57,920 --> 00:53:59,520
 And that's what it says in the patent.

1635
00:53:59,520 --> 00:54:01,120
 It's useful for people with one hand.

1636
00:54:01,120 --> 00:54:02,520
 - That's why it's so useful, actually,

1637
00:54:02,520 --> 00:54:05,360
 for the pensioners at Dan's Blue Movie Cinema

1638
00:54:05,360 --> 00:54:08,240
 who want to have a hand-free and enjoy a cinema snack.

1639
00:54:08,240 --> 00:54:11,280
 - Dan's Blue Movie Cinema, as it is otherwise known.

1640
00:54:11,280 --> 00:54:13,200
 - As it will be, 'cause they're selling it, aren't they?

1641
00:54:13,200 --> 00:54:15,320
 - I have a balloon in my beard.

1642
00:54:15,320 --> 00:54:17,160
 - Because in the patent it says it's important

1643
00:54:17,160 --> 00:54:19,480
 not only for persons who have only one hand,

1644
00:54:19,480 --> 00:54:22,240
 but also persons who often have only one hand free.

1645
00:54:22,240 --> 00:54:24,120
 - Right. - There we go.

1646
00:54:24,120 --> 00:54:26,240
 - His occupation causes their hands

1647
00:54:26,240 --> 00:54:28,360
 to become smeared with dirt.

1648
00:54:28,360 --> 00:54:30,480
 - Well, this is all brilliant news, Dan.

1649
00:54:30,480 --> 00:54:31,760
 - Get in touch with your drums.

1650
00:54:31,760 --> 00:54:33,440
 - Freud's penis dispenser in one hand

1651
00:54:33,440 --> 00:54:35,340
 and your actual penis in the other.

1652
00:54:35,340 --> 00:54:36,580
 (laughing)

1653
00:54:36,580 --> 00:54:39,160
 (upbeat music)

1654
00:54:39,160 --> 00:54:41,880
 - Okay, that's it.

1655
00:54:41,880 --> 00:54:42,920
 - That is all of our facts.
