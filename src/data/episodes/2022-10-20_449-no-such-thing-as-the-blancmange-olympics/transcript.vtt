00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580
 (upbeat music)

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:17.220
 - Hello, and welcome to another episode

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:20.220
 of No Such Thing as a Fish, a weekly podcast

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:23.300
 coming to you from the QI offices in Covent Garden.

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:24.620
 My name is Dan Schreiber.

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:27.900
 I'm sitting here with Anna Tyshinski, Andrew Hunter Murray,

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:29.860
 and James Harkin, and once again,

00:00:29.860 --> 00:00:31.440
 we have gathered around the microphones

00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:34.400
 with our four favorite facts from the last seven days,

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:37.720
 and in no particular order, here we go.

00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:41.320
 Starting with fact number one, and that is Andy.

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:43.640
 - My fact is that one traditional Irish recipe

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:46.280
 for Blemange involves moss.

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:47.120
 - Here we go.

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:52.120
 - So, this is a cool fact about an old Irish pudding,

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:53.840
 and it's--

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:55.680
 - That's what they say if you have to say it's cool.

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:56.840
 - Yeah, they have to tell the listener.

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:59.080
 - It's interesting, and it's cool.

00:00:59.080 --> 00:01:01.120
 And it's actually from a hack-eye magazine,

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:02.160
 which I know you read--

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:03.000
 - That's Anna, isn't it?

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:03.840
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah, sort of.

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:04.680
 - You stole my 19.

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:05.500
 - I know, I'm on your turf already.

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:07.400
 But basically, there is this pudding,

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:12.040
 and it's made from a thing called dried carrageen.

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:14.680
 Okay, now, it's called moss, it's called Irish moss,

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:17.040
 it's not actually moss, it's a kind of algae,

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:19.760
 and it's brown and crusty stuff

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:21.560
 when you take it out of the water, you dry out.

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:22.400
 - Sounds delicious.

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:24.360
 (laughing)

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:27.320
 - You have to boil it in milk for 20 minutes.

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:28.160
 - Okay.

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:29.280
 - And the thing is, when you boil it in milk,

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:31.240
 it vomits out this huge--

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:33.400
 - Sounds absolutely delicious.

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:36.000
 - You thought we were having your own cookery show.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:37.000
 You were next in my jello.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:40.280
 - It sort of vomits out this jelly stuff.

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:41.120
 - Yeah.

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:43.560
 - And you add the sugar and vanilla

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:45.920
 to make it slightly sweet, and you whisk it all up,

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:46.920
 and then you let it chill a bit.

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:50.640
 - I just love just going off the jello analogy,

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:53.080
 the way that you really, when you said vomiting up,

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:55.600
 you said it a few times, and you really stressed it.

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:56.720
 And then when you got to the nice bit

00:01:56.720 --> 00:01:58.160
 of adding some vanilla and sugar,

00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:59.800
 you were like, "Oh yeah, we'll just gloss over that."

00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:00.640
 That's fine.

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:03.280
 - Yeah, and then you've got your moss blommage.

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:06.400
 - And it apparently, it's quite crap, isn't it?

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:08.360
 - Well, what's bad about it?

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:09.760
 - I just think it's extremely bland,

00:02:09.760 --> 00:02:11.520
 but I think it's good if you add a little bit.

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:13.080
 - It doesn't really taste of any,

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:15.160
 some people say it tastes of the sea.

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:16.000
 - Yes.

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.080
 - But actually, I think it just tastes really bland.

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:20.280
 And they used to give it to sick people, didn't they?

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:21.560
 If you were ill and infirm,

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:23.560
 you might get some of this pudding.

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:26.440
 It's in a 19th century handbook of invalid cooking

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:29.200
 by Murray Boland, that's one of the early recipes.

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:30.040
 - Okay, right.

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:31.680
 - And other recipes in that book,

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:35.200
 oatmeal mush, delicious, scraped beef.

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:36.760
 - Scraped beef.

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:40.040
 - Milk lemonade, which just sounds disgusting to me.

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:42.960
 Apart from it contains sherry, milk lemonade.

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:44.960
 And restorative jelly.

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:47.400
 And the restorative part of that is it has port in it.

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:48.240
 - Oh, okay, nice.

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:49.720
 - Like alko jelly kind of thing.

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:51.800
 - I wish we were doing hello fresh ads in this period,

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:54.800
 where these were the recipes that we were advertising.

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:56.320
 - This algae, this seaweed,

00:02:56.320 --> 00:02:57.360
 how do you pronounce it again, Andy?

00:02:57.360 --> 00:02:58.280
 - I said carrageen.

00:02:58.280 --> 00:02:59.720
 - Carrageen, yeah.

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:02.040
 This is one of those stealth things that's in our life

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:04.400
 in so many different ways that we don't quite recognize.

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:06.480
 So if you look at the back of the ingredients list

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:07.800
 on many of the things in your house,

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:09.280
 you're gonna find this as one of the elements.

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:11.360
 So it's in things like toothpaste.

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:13.640
 It's in shampoo and cosmetics.

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:16.000
 Firefighters use it to get a better foam

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:17.520
 when they're fighting fires.

00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:18.480
 It's part of that.

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:19.880
 Yeah, it's used in that.

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:23.040
 It's used in personal lubricants.

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:25.440
 Check your ingredients at home.

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:26.280
 But it's everywhere.

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:27.320
 Shoe polish everywhere.

00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:28.160
 - Laxatives.

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:29.280
 - Laxatives, yeah.

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:30.920
 - Helps those slide out.

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:33.360
 It seems to be a couch.

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:35.080
 - It's good for helping things slide out.

00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:36.600
 - Yeah, yeah.

00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:38.560
 But it's very controversial.

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:40.520
 Did you guys read about the rabid controversy

00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:41.800
 surrounding carrageen?

00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:43.760
 Well--

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:45.640
 - Is this athletes?

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:46.800
 - Oh, it's not, maybe there are two.

00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:47.880
 - Oh no, okay, okay.

00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:50.040
 - Oh my God, okay, let's compare controversies.

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:53.240
 This is just that it could be very bad for you

00:03:53.240 --> 00:03:55.080
 and cause deadly diseases.

00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:56.120
 It doesn't.

00:03:56.120 --> 00:03:56.960
 But--

00:03:56.960 --> 00:03:57.800
 - What?

00:03:57.800 --> 00:04:00.080
 - Yeah, there was a roller coaster.

00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:03.560
 - 'Cause it was a very much a one dip roller coaster.

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:06.840
 - This is a rumour that goes around in health circles

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:09.280
 about carrageenan, which is like the extract

00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:10.800
 from the seaweed and carrageenan.

00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:11.880
 - Ultra concentrated.

00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:12.720
 - Essence.

00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:15.080
 - Yes, and that is used, as we've said,

00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:15.920
 in lots of thicknesses.

00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:18.400
 It's also in ice cream, cottage cheese, soy milk,

00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:19.360
 things like that.

00:04:19.360 --> 00:04:22.920
 And there was a academic called Joanne Tabakman,

00:04:22.920 --> 00:04:25.040
 who I think is still going campaigning against it,

00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:28.880
 who said a few years ago that it caused all sorts of

00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:31.560
 cancers, Parkinson's, heart disease, things like that.

00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:34.600
 She was actually looking at a different thing.

00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:36.680
 So it turned out someone looked into the study

00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:39.400
 and she was looking at something that was called like--

00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:40.480
 - Gamma radiation.

00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:44.560
 - Yeah, a slightly different kind of seaweed.

00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:47.560
 But it's great, and if you go on any health website,

00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:49.920
 it's like avoid carrageen, it will give you cancer,

00:04:49.920 --> 00:04:51.480
 it'll give you heart attacks, it'll give you--

00:04:51.480 --> 00:04:52.960
 So don't believe it.

00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:54.800
 - It's almost carcinogen.

00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:56.560
 Like the word is very similar, isn't it?

00:04:56.560 --> 00:04:57.400
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:04:57.400 --> 00:04:58.240
 - Maybe that's what she studied.

00:04:58.240 --> 00:04:59.640
 She looked at carcinogens and said,

00:04:59.640 --> 00:05:00.800
 "Well, these all cause cancer."

00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:03.720
 - Next to each other in the dictionary.

00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:05.240
 - Its latter name is really fun.

00:05:05.240 --> 00:05:06.920
 It's called Chondus Crispus.

00:05:06.920 --> 00:05:07.760
 - Ah!

00:05:07.760 --> 00:05:09.400
 - It's just a nice-- - Chondus Crispus.

00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:10.240
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:12.840
 - I'd like to hear about the sport in controversy,

00:05:12.840 --> 00:05:14.760
 and I'd like to have a guess of what it might be,

00:05:14.760 --> 00:05:17.360
 'cause it's like a slippery thing, right?

00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:19.760
 So maybe they attach it to toboggan's

00:05:19.760 --> 00:05:22.760
 when you do bobsled, and it makes you fly down the bobsled.

00:05:22.760 --> 00:05:24.720
 - That's correct, that's absolutely right.

00:05:24.720 --> 00:05:26.040
 (laughing)

00:05:26.040 --> 00:05:27.680
 - Or, here's another version.

00:05:27.680 --> 00:05:31.000
 They put a load of it in the swimming pool,

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:33.480
 and it thickens up the water,

00:05:33.480 --> 00:05:35.520
 and it means that you can just run across the water

00:05:35.520 --> 00:05:36.360
 in a swimming race.

00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:37.480
 - That would help everyone though.

00:05:37.480 --> 00:05:39.080
 You have to put it in one lane.

00:05:39.080 --> 00:05:40.520
 (laughing)

00:05:40.520 --> 00:05:42.640
 One lane, someone doing the 50 meters.

00:05:42.640 --> 00:05:44.360
 - Yeah, okay.

00:05:44.360 --> 00:05:46.000
 - Or you could do it in your opponent's lane,

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:47.240
 and so it slows them down.

00:05:47.240 --> 00:05:49.400
 - I'd also like a quarter swimming through the big pool.

00:05:49.400 --> 00:05:50.600
 - I think you have to have a lot of caragine

00:05:50.600 --> 00:05:52.400
 to turn water into a solid.

00:05:52.400 --> 00:05:54.680
 - Imagine the Olympic swimming pool.

00:05:54.680 --> 00:05:56.920
 You've got one beautiful clear lane of water,

00:05:56.920 --> 00:05:58.960
 and all the others are plamange, basically.

00:05:58.960 --> 00:06:01.040
 (laughing)

00:06:01.040 --> 00:06:02.120
 - So it's neither of those things.

00:06:02.120 --> 00:06:02.960
 - It's neither of those.

00:06:02.960 --> 00:06:03.800
 No, the Australian cricket team

00:06:03.800 --> 00:06:05.380
 have been using it for years to--

00:06:05.380 --> 00:06:07.080
 - No, they haven't. - Classic, all right.

00:06:07.080 --> 00:06:08.400
 (laughing)

00:06:08.400 --> 00:06:10.800
 It's bad that I believe that.

00:06:10.800 --> 00:06:13.040
 - What it is, is actually, I don't think it's a control,

00:06:13.040 --> 00:06:14.160
 I jumped the gun a bit.

00:06:14.160 --> 00:06:15.960
 I think it's also been used by athletes

00:06:15.960 --> 00:06:18.640
 and bodybuilders, although I'm not completely sure

00:06:18.640 --> 00:06:19.880
 if what capacity.

00:06:19.880 --> 00:06:21.760
 - Maybe make them smoother.

00:06:21.760 --> 00:06:23.320
 To make them look smoother.

00:06:23.320 --> 00:06:25.360
 - That might be it, yeah.

00:06:25.360 --> 00:06:27.000
 - There's the control.

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:29.040
 - I said I jumped the gun on it, I really.

00:06:29.040 --> 00:06:31.120
 But there is, okay, there is a thing.

00:06:31.120 --> 00:06:34.360
 It's an aphrodisiac, which is good news, but for rats.

00:06:34.360 --> 00:06:35.800
 - So, okay. - Good news for rats.

00:06:35.800 --> 00:06:38.120
 - It's fancy rats. - It's fancy rats.

00:06:38.120 --> 00:06:39.560
 - Really, I mean, it really,

00:06:39.560 --> 00:06:41.320
 and I think it's a fertility aid, actually.

00:06:41.320 --> 00:06:43.360
 It ramps up your testicles, is the phrase I've written down.

00:06:43.360 --> 00:06:45.000
 - Ramps up your testicles.

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:46.880
 - You don't want to put ramps up your testicles,

00:06:46.880 --> 00:06:48.440
 that's gonna be.

00:06:48.440 --> 00:06:50.680
 - Odd, not too much and tiny little effusions now.

00:06:50.680 --> 00:06:54.000
 Climbing up, wheelchair-friendly testicles.

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:55.160
 Fun.

00:06:55.160 --> 00:06:56.720
 - What does it do, sorry, to your testicles?

00:06:56.720 --> 00:06:57.920
 - It ramps them up.

00:06:57.920 --> 00:07:00.000
 - What's that mean, like the outer coating,

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:02.040
 or like the inner ball?

00:07:02.040 --> 00:07:04.320
 - It gives the sperm a lot more motility,

00:07:04.320 --> 00:07:06.920
 and I think it makes the balls bigger, maybe, as well.

00:07:06.920 --> 00:07:10.360
 - The caragine is responsible for my fair lady,

00:07:10.360 --> 00:07:13.520
 the musical. - Really?

00:07:13.520 --> 00:07:14.640
 - Well, we'll see.

00:07:14.640 --> 00:07:15.560
 - Wow.

00:07:15.560 --> 00:07:18.560
 - So, it's used in medical circuits.

00:07:18.560 --> 00:07:19.720
 - These are terrible headlines,

00:07:19.720 --> 00:07:21.360
 these are like those websites, they're like,

00:07:21.360 --> 00:07:22.200
 did you know that?

00:07:22.200 --> 00:07:24.680
 - I mean, it's just not there.

00:07:24.680 --> 00:07:26.880
 - The controversy, you're seaweed.

00:07:26.880 --> 00:07:30.280
 - Well, it's used medicinally, Irish masks.

00:07:30.280 --> 00:07:32.080
 It's good for like your throat,

00:07:32.080 --> 00:07:34.120
 it's supposed to be good for your throat.

00:07:34.120 --> 00:07:35.600
 In fact, there's some evidence

00:07:35.600 --> 00:07:38.760
 that it might stunt the replication of COVID, as well,

00:07:38.760 --> 00:07:40.680
 although that's not certain yet.

00:07:40.680 --> 00:07:42.560
 But anyway, the person who introduced it

00:07:42.560 --> 00:07:45.640
 into medical use was a guy called Mr. Todd Hunter.

00:07:45.640 --> 00:07:48.760
 And Mr. Todd Hunter is more famous as a playwright.

00:07:48.760 --> 00:07:50.760
 Okay, and he did a play called

00:07:50.760 --> 00:07:54.440
 The Land of Hearts Desire in Dublin,

00:07:54.440 --> 00:07:57.400
 and it was so bad, so, so bad,

00:07:57.400 --> 00:07:59.200
 that everyone just booed him off.

00:07:59.200 --> 00:08:01.160
 They kept booing him, every time he put it on,

00:08:01.160 --> 00:08:02.680
 they booed him off, they booed him off,

00:08:02.680 --> 00:08:06.440
 was taken off the rotor of the playhouse,

00:08:06.440 --> 00:08:09.120
 and it was replaced by Arms of the Man,

00:08:09.120 --> 00:08:12.200
 which was the first success of George Bernard Shaw,

00:08:12.200 --> 00:08:13.800
 who went on to write Pygmalion,

00:08:13.800 --> 00:08:15.240
 which my fair lady was based on.

00:08:15.240 --> 00:08:16.720
 - Yes. - I was gonna guess that.

00:08:16.720 --> 00:08:17.560
 - Yeah. - Yeah.

00:08:17.560 --> 00:08:18.880
 - That's flawless. - That's amazing.

00:08:18.880 --> 00:08:21.400
 - Actually, I think that does check out, that's great.

00:08:21.400 --> 00:08:25.440
 I've got in my notes here, I don't know who wrote these.

00:08:25.440 --> 00:08:28.200
 The Irish Moss saved America,

00:08:28.200 --> 00:08:33.200
 because there was a lot of it grown in the USA,

00:08:33.200 --> 00:08:37.840
 and there, in fact, there's a town near Boston,

00:08:37.840 --> 00:08:39.240
 it's called Skituate.

00:08:40.920 --> 00:08:43.760
 Skituated, very near Boston, brilliant,

00:08:43.760 --> 00:08:46.400
 which is, supposedly, it calls itself

00:08:46.400 --> 00:08:48.120
 the most Irish town in the whole of the USA,

00:08:48.120 --> 00:08:51.040
 about 50% of the population there are Irish,

00:08:51.040 --> 00:08:52.640
 and from the 1840s onwards,

00:08:52.640 --> 00:08:55.160
 it was a big site for Irish moss farming,

00:08:55.160 --> 00:08:57.360
 as in they farmed it, they grew it.

00:08:57.360 --> 00:09:01.360
 - Yeah, you get it, it kind of comes onto the shore

00:09:01.360 --> 00:09:03.480
 in North America and in Europe, doesn't it?

00:09:03.480 --> 00:09:05.480
 - Exactly, yeah, yeah, and he saw some in the water,

00:09:05.480 --> 00:09:06.320
 and he thought, wait, I know that,

00:09:06.320 --> 00:09:07.760
 I recognize that from when I was in Ireland,

00:09:07.760 --> 00:09:10.040
 and so he set up the industry, basically,

00:09:10.040 --> 00:09:11.480
 this guy who's called Daniel Ward.

00:09:11.480 --> 00:09:14.000
 Anyway, so it became big, big, big industry for this town.

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:15.400
 During the Second World War,

00:09:15.400 --> 00:09:17.640
 suddenly, there was a thing called agar,

00:09:17.640 --> 00:09:19.640
 it's an agar jelly, you know?

00:09:19.640 --> 00:09:20.640
 That was no longer available,

00:09:20.640 --> 00:09:22.440
 'cause that was grown in the Far East.

00:09:22.440 --> 00:09:26.240
 - Okay, and you need agar to grow bacteria and stuff?

00:09:26.240 --> 00:09:27.680
 - Well, it's a thickening agent,

00:09:27.680 --> 00:09:29.320
 it's in all sorts of foods,

00:09:29.320 --> 00:09:30.960
 and basically, it was no longer available,

00:09:30.960 --> 00:09:32.920
 'cause it was largely grown in Japan and places like that,

00:09:32.920 --> 00:09:35.320
 which were obviously no longer trading with the USA.

00:09:35.320 --> 00:09:37.360
 Irish moss carrion, and basically,

00:09:37.360 --> 00:09:39.520
 rocketed in production.

00:09:39.520 --> 00:09:43.080
 In Canada, they made 261,000 pounds in 1941.

00:09:43.080 --> 00:09:45.800
 The next year, they made over 2 million pounds

00:09:45.800 --> 00:09:48.040
 of this stuff for use in foods.

00:09:48.040 --> 00:09:50.040
 Yeah, it was a huge deal.

00:09:50.040 --> 00:09:52.040
 - And why did it save America?

00:09:52.040 --> 00:09:52.880
 - Well--

00:09:52.880 --> 00:09:53.880
 - Otherwise, they would have starved to death

00:09:53.880 --> 00:09:55.200
 if they didn't have ice cream or whatever.

00:09:55.200 --> 00:09:57.160
 - Well, they wouldn't have had pleasant sauces,

00:09:57.160 --> 00:09:59.520
 drinks of war, in fact, on morale.

00:09:59.520 --> 00:10:02.240
 - Yeah, yeah, is it called the man in the high castle,

00:10:02.240 --> 00:10:03.720
 where they imagined that the Germans

00:10:03.720 --> 00:10:04.920
 had won the Second World War?

00:10:05.480 --> 00:10:07.720
 - I think we should make a prequel of it,

00:10:07.720 --> 00:10:09.840
 where we actually look at what the reason

00:10:09.840 --> 00:10:12.720
 they lost the war, and it was because of this lack of aga.

00:10:12.720 --> 00:10:14.440
 - Probably, that's huge, yeah.

00:10:14.440 --> 00:10:15.280
 - That's right.

00:10:15.280 --> 00:10:16.520
 - So, are you buying that?

00:10:16.520 --> 00:10:17.360
 - Nope.

00:10:17.360 --> 00:10:18.200
 (laughing)

00:10:18.200 --> 00:10:19.040
 - You know how we were saying

00:10:19.040 --> 00:10:20.960
 that carrageen was in health food?

00:10:20.960 --> 00:10:23.320
 Always has been, many thousands of years has been round,

00:10:23.320 --> 00:10:25.360
 and I came across an article in the New York Times

00:10:25.360 --> 00:10:28.400
 in, I think it was, like, 1904 or something,

00:10:28.400 --> 00:10:30.640
 and it was, I just found it really amusing

00:10:30.640 --> 00:10:32.880
 how little the police obviously had to do at this time.

00:10:32.880 --> 00:10:36.840
 So, it was a story about how a Romanian gypsy woman

00:10:36.840 --> 00:10:40.520
 had been arrested in Jamaica for charging over $7,000,

00:10:40.520 --> 00:10:43.440
 which was a lot then, for basically Irish moss.

00:10:43.440 --> 00:10:45.200
 - It's a lot now for Irish moss.

00:10:45.200 --> 00:10:46.040
 - It's good.

00:10:46.040 --> 00:10:46.880
 - It is, don't pay that for Irish moss.

00:10:46.880 --> 00:10:48.880
 - But how much Irish moss are we talking about?

00:10:48.880 --> 00:10:50.400
 - It was a very small tincture

00:10:50.400 --> 00:10:52.560
 dropped in a glass of water, in secret.

00:10:52.560 --> 00:10:53.720
 - $7,000?

00:10:53.720 --> 00:10:54.560
 - Yeah, it's too much, isn't it?

00:10:54.560 --> 00:10:55.480
 - Who's the buyer?

00:10:55.480 --> 00:10:58.000
 - Well, it was this lady who had a hunchback

00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:00.360
 that she wanted cured, so she employed a healer,

00:11:00.360 --> 00:11:02.560
 this woman who said she was Romanian.

00:11:02.560 --> 00:11:05.040
 Anyway, the healer said she boiled some water,

00:11:05.040 --> 00:11:06.800
 she covered it with cloth and she said,

00:11:06.800 --> 00:11:09.160
 "Look at that water, don't touch it, don't move,

00:11:09.160 --> 00:11:12.080
 "don't tell anyone for 24 hours what I've done,

00:11:12.080 --> 00:11:13.480
 "and then you'll be cured."

00:11:13.480 --> 00:11:16.080
 And the woman, idiot, ruined the cure by telling her mates,

00:11:16.080 --> 00:11:17.640
 she was like, "Look, I've employed this doctor,

00:11:17.640 --> 00:11:19.880
 "but I'm a bit suspicious about the cure,"

00:11:19.880 --> 00:11:20.880
 'cause she just told me to, like,

00:11:20.880 --> 00:11:22.320
 not touch this glass of water for 24 hours.

00:11:22.320 --> 00:11:24.080
 - For 24 hours, while she goes to the coast

00:11:24.080 --> 00:11:26.360
 and gets the nearest ship with her new $7,000.

00:11:26.360 --> 00:11:27.680
 - Well, no, 'cause she'd only charged,

00:11:27.680 --> 00:11:28.960
 like, a hundred at that point.

00:11:28.960 --> 00:11:30.840
 So, the woman reported it to the police.

00:11:30.840 --> 00:11:32.600
 Two detectives came to her house,

00:11:32.600 --> 00:11:34.480
 hid behind the curtains,

00:11:34.480 --> 00:11:37.640
 and the Romanian lady came back to say,

00:11:37.640 --> 00:11:39.960
 "You know, okay, that was the first step,

00:11:39.960 --> 00:11:41.920
 "now the next step comes,"

00:11:41.920 --> 00:11:44.720
 and the detectives saw her slip some Irish moss

00:11:44.720 --> 00:11:46.920
 into the water and then say,

00:11:46.920 --> 00:11:49.640
 "Okay, now I'm gonna charge you $7,000,"

00:11:49.640 --> 00:11:51.680
 and then, as she was gonna hand over the money

00:11:51.680 --> 00:11:53.720
 in the details, the detectives jumped up.

00:11:53.720 --> 00:11:56.160
 - Do you get police doing that much these days?

00:11:56.160 --> 00:11:57.400
 Sort of, "We'll come into your house,

00:11:57.400 --> 00:11:58.560
 "hide behind your curtains."

00:11:58.560 --> 00:11:59.800
 - I think that's fine. - That's whether you don't.

00:11:59.800 --> 00:12:01.520
 I think it's a disgrace.

00:12:01.520 --> 00:12:02.960
 I want, for my taxes,

00:12:02.960 --> 00:12:05.520
 I want policemen hiding behind my curtains

00:12:05.520 --> 00:12:06.360
 every day of the week.

00:12:06.360 --> 00:12:07.840
 - Did she have an exact time she was coming back?

00:12:07.840 --> 00:12:10.760
 How long were the police hiding behind the curtains?

00:12:10.760 --> 00:12:11.920
 - She said Wednesday.

00:12:11.920 --> 00:12:14.400
 - Passing another cup of tea behind the curtains.

00:12:14.400 --> 00:12:16.240
 (laughing)

00:12:16.240 --> 00:12:17.120
 - She had to knock,

00:12:17.120 --> 00:12:18.440
 so they could just hang out in the kitchen,

00:12:18.440 --> 00:12:19.280
 I suppose, until--

00:12:19.280 --> 00:12:20.760
 - Like a surprise party.

00:12:20.760 --> 00:12:22.200
 Everyone, everyone, quick, quick, quick, quick.

00:12:22.200 --> 00:12:23.040
 - Exactly, exactly.

00:12:23.040 --> 00:12:24.720
 - False alarm, it's an Amazon delivery.

00:12:24.720 --> 00:12:27.600
 - Did you guys hear about Mim Flynn?

00:12:27.600 --> 00:12:28.560
 - Mim Flynn. - Mim Flynn.

00:12:28.560 --> 00:12:30.040
 - The Irish mossing queen?

00:12:30.040 --> 00:12:30.880
 - No. - No.

00:12:30.880 --> 00:12:32.520
 (laughing)

00:12:32.520 --> 00:12:34.480
 - She was, she wasn't a beauty queen or anything.

00:12:34.480 --> 00:12:38.080
 She was the queen of the Irish moss industry

00:12:38.080 --> 00:12:40.320
 because she was a great mosser,

00:12:40.320 --> 00:12:42.000
 and she started at the age of nine.

00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:44.320
 - Is a mosser someone who eats it or who collects it?

00:12:44.320 --> 00:12:45.160
 - Harvested it.

00:12:45.160 --> 00:12:48.760
 - I think she was in Skituate, Skituate.

00:12:48.760 --> 00:12:50.600
 - I thought you said she was Irish.

00:12:50.600 --> 00:12:51.680
 - No, Irish moss.

00:12:51.680 --> 00:12:52.520
 - Oh, I see.

00:12:52.520 --> 00:12:53.520
 - Oh, where was she? - She was the--

00:12:53.520 --> 00:12:54.360
 - America. - In Skituate.

00:12:54.360 --> 00:12:57.160
 - She was the American Irish mossing--

00:12:57.160 --> 00:12:59.600
 - Did we not pay attention?

00:12:59.600 --> 00:13:00.840
 Remember his hilarious pun earlier?

00:13:00.840 --> 00:13:02.160
 - It's just outside Boston.

00:13:02.160 --> 00:13:03.840
 - I blank them out too, but--

00:13:03.840 --> 00:13:06.440
 - Skituated, just outside Boston.

00:13:06.440 --> 00:13:09.160
 - I must not have been here at the time.

00:13:09.160 --> 00:13:10.500
 - I didn't hear.

00:13:10.500 --> 00:13:11.340
 - I don't think I was.

00:13:11.340 --> 00:13:12.180
 - I don't think there was any evidence.

00:13:12.180 --> 00:13:15.360
 - Audio, imagine if I had to out your original paper.

00:13:15.360 --> 00:13:18.160
 (laughing)

00:13:18.160 --> 00:13:19.880
 - So, but yeah, give us more about her.

00:13:19.880 --> 00:13:21.800
 Is she-- - How's she doing?

00:13:21.800 --> 00:13:23.000
 - I think she's passed away now.

00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:23.840
 - Right.

00:13:23.840 --> 00:13:24.920
 - But Skituate these days,

00:13:24.920 --> 00:13:26.640
 it does have a mossing museum.

00:13:26.640 --> 00:13:27.480
 - Cool.

00:13:27.480 --> 00:13:28.320
 - Yeah. - Is it?

00:13:28.320 --> 00:13:29.160
 - Yeah, yeah.

00:13:29.160 --> 00:13:31.840
 There's no longer much of an industry as Moot Evices.

00:13:31.840 --> 00:13:32.960
 - Well, if you're in Skituate,

00:13:32.960 --> 00:13:34.160
 and you're wondering what to do.

00:13:34.160 --> 00:13:37.120
 - Yeah, also, I've probably said Skituate wrong.

00:13:37.120 --> 00:13:37.960
 That all the way through.

00:13:37.960 --> 00:13:40.080
 - So, look on the map, don't ask a local.

00:13:40.080 --> 00:13:40.920
 - Yeah, yeah.

00:13:40.920 --> 00:13:43.200
 Get a pair of compasses, put the middle point in Boston,

00:13:43.200 --> 00:13:45.680
 and the other arm to 30 miles,

00:13:45.680 --> 00:13:47.520
 and it'll be on that line.

00:13:47.520 --> 00:13:48.520
 - Which way? - Which way?

00:13:48.520 --> 00:13:49.840
 - Which way?

00:13:49.840 --> 00:13:51.040
 - Well, it'll be coastal.

00:13:51.040 --> 00:13:53.320
 So, I only know it's 30 miles outside Boston.

00:13:53.320 --> 00:13:54.160
 - Okay, cool.

00:13:54.160 --> 00:13:55.000
 (laughing)

00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:56.520
 - Just go 30 miles south of Boston,

00:13:56.520 --> 00:13:57.880
 along the coast, and if it's not there,

00:13:57.880 --> 00:13:59.080
 go 60 miles north.

00:13:59.080 --> 00:14:01.040
 (laughing)

00:14:01.040 --> 00:14:02.840
 - So, just on Belmont,

00:14:02.840 --> 00:14:04.400
 we should talk about the fact that

00:14:04.400 --> 00:14:05.560
 it was only quite recently

00:14:05.560 --> 00:14:06.920
 that it stopped containing meat.

00:14:06.920 --> 00:14:08.000
 - Yeah. - Yeah.

00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:08.840
 - Really? - Yeah.

00:14:08.840 --> 00:14:09.680
 Weird.

00:14:09.680 --> 00:14:10.800
 So, Belmont's been around since,

00:14:10.800 --> 00:14:11.760
 I think the earliest recipe

00:14:11.760 --> 00:14:13.800
 maybe comes from Baghdad in the 10th century,

00:14:13.800 --> 00:14:15.680
 a long time,

00:14:15.680 --> 00:14:17.320
 and it was only in the 18th century

00:14:17.320 --> 00:14:19.000
 they thought, "Let's stop putting chicken in this."

00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:19.840
 - Yeah.

00:14:19.840 --> 00:14:20.680
 (laughing)

00:14:20.680 --> 00:14:22.320
 - It just sounds so rough.

00:14:22.320 --> 00:14:24.840
 - They just used chicken as,

00:14:24.840 --> 00:14:26.360
 basically, in the same way

00:14:26.360 --> 00:14:27.440
 that they used this seaweed

00:14:27.440 --> 00:14:29.880
 as kind of to make it more gelatinous,

00:14:29.880 --> 00:14:31.280
 to make it stringy.

00:14:31.280 --> 00:14:32.680
 It had a pleasant stringiness, I think.

00:14:32.680 --> 00:14:33.520
 - Oh, lovely.

00:14:33.520 --> 00:14:35.960
 - And you shredded and really pounded up the chicken,

00:14:35.960 --> 00:14:37.760
 so it lost all of its flavor, I believe,

00:14:37.760 --> 00:14:40.920
 and mixed it up with some almond milk

00:14:40.920 --> 00:14:43.640
 and some sugar and some rice.

00:14:43.640 --> 00:14:45.360
 And yum, and they still eat it in turkey,

00:14:45.360 --> 00:14:46.440
 almost the same thing, it seems like.

00:14:46.440 --> 00:14:47.280
 - Oh, really?

00:14:47.280 --> 00:14:48.920
 What actually would the chicken in still?

00:14:48.920 --> 00:14:51.360
 - Yeah, yeah, it's called tavuk gogsu,

00:14:51.360 --> 00:14:53.240
 and it literally means,

00:14:53.240 --> 00:14:54.840
 and I really want English people to have gone

00:14:54.840 --> 00:14:56.440
 and ordered it, having done the Google translate,

00:14:56.440 --> 00:14:58.760
 'cause it literally means chicken breast.

00:14:58.760 --> 00:15:01.360
 But you order it, and what you get is a blamange.

00:15:01.360 --> 00:15:03.320
 (laughing)

00:15:03.320 --> 00:15:04.640
 You look at everything on the menu,

00:15:04.640 --> 00:15:06.680
 and you're like, "Oh, I can't, I don't want that, I don't."

00:15:06.680 --> 00:15:07.800
 Oh, chicken breast!

00:15:07.800 --> 00:15:09.560
 (laughing)

00:15:09.560 --> 00:15:10.560
 That's safe.

00:15:10.560 --> 00:15:13.440
 - What a weird-ass chicken, so they have it in turkey.

00:15:13.440 --> 00:15:14.840
 - Have you guys heard of Bompas and Pa?

00:15:14.840 --> 00:15:15.680
 - No.

00:15:15.680 --> 00:15:16.840
 - They're a jelly innovation firm,

00:15:16.840 --> 00:15:19.480
 and they basically do absolutely mad things

00:15:19.480 --> 00:15:20.840
 with jelly all the time.

00:15:20.840 --> 00:15:23.280
 They're constantly coming up with incredible innovations,

00:15:23.280 --> 00:15:25.600
 and weird flavors, and anyway,

00:15:25.600 --> 00:15:27.800
 I just look through a list of all the things

00:15:27.800 --> 00:15:28.880
 they've done over the years.

00:15:28.880 --> 00:15:31.840
 One year, for Valentine's Day, they created a jelly

00:15:31.840 --> 00:15:34.200
 which was called throbber.

00:15:34.200 --> 00:15:35.040
 - Oh, boy.

00:15:35.040 --> 00:15:37.680
 - THROBR, which I can--

00:15:37.680 --> 00:15:38.760
 - Sounds like an app, doesn't it?

00:15:38.760 --> 00:15:40.640
 - It does sound like an app.

00:15:40.640 --> 00:15:42.160
 It's amazing what this jelly does.

00:15:42.160 --> 00:15:44.640
 It locks onto your heart rate,

00:15:44.640 --> 00:15:48.760
 and it pulses in time with your heart rate

00:15:48.760 --> 00:15:50.400
 as you're eating it.

00:15:50.400 --> 00:15:51.640
 I don't know.

00:15:51.640 --> 00:15:53.120
 So if you get very excited as you're eating

00:15:53.120 --> 00:15:55.560
 the jelly, the jelly itself will start reflecting that.

00:15:55.560 --> 00:15:58.720
 - It does feel like, 'cause it's called throbber,

00:15:58.720 --> 00:16:01.920
 that perhaps, if you got an erection,

00:16:01.920 --> 00:16:04.200
 the stiffer your erection, the stiffer the jelly

00:16:04.200 --> 00:16:05.040
 would get.

00:16:05.040 --> 00:16:06.760
 (all laughing)

00:16:06.760 --> 00:16:08.040
 - Make a steak knife for this one.

00:16:08.040 --> 00:16:10.640
 (all laughing)

00:16:10.640 --> 00:16:18.160
 - Okay, it is time for fact number two,

00:16:18.160 --> 00:16:20.040
 and that is James.

00:16:20.040 --> 00:16:22.640
 - Okay, my fact this week is that when communism fell

00:16:22.640 --> 00:16:26.080
 in Czechoslovakia, the US ambassador in the country

00:16:26.080 --> 00:16:27.840
 was Shirley Temple.

00:16:27.840 --> 00:16:29.400
 (all laughing)

00:16:29.400 --> 00:16:30.720
 - Really weird.

00:16:30.720 --> 00:16:32.120
 - I think this is amazing.

00:16:32.120 --> 00:16:33.640
 Some people might know this already.

00:16:33.640 --> 00:16:35.320
 I've spoken to one or two people who have,

00:16:35.320 --> 00:16:39.400
 but to me, Shirley Temple is a child movie star

00:16:39.400 --> 00:16:41.480
 who basically retired when she was 10 years old.

00:16:41.480 --> 00:16:42.320
 - Exactly.

00:16:42.320 --> 00:16:44.440
 - But actually, when she got a bit older,

00:16:44.440 --> 00:16:46.640
 when she was 44, she became a diplomat,

00:16:46.640 --> 00:16:48.920
 and she did loads of stuff for the US.

00:16:48.920 --> 00:16:52.880
 She was the first woman to serve as US ambassador to Ghana,

00:16:52.880 --> 00:16:56.680
 but she was also the ambassador in Czechoslovakia in 1989

00:16:56.680 --> 00:16:58.920
 when the Velvet Revolution happened,

00:16:58.920 --> 00:17:02.840
 and the communist regime fell in what is now Czechia,

00:17:02.840 --> 00:17:03.840
 and Slovakia.

00:17:03.840 --> 00:17:04.800
 - Yeah. - Amazing.

00:17:04.800 --> 00:17:05.640
 - It is amazing.

00:17:05.640 --> 00:17:07.560
 - Weirdly, she was sort of there

00:17:07.560 --> 00:17:09.240
 towards the start as well, wasn't she?

00:17:09.240 --> 00:17:11.320
 She thinks maybe one of the things that helped her

00:17:11.320 --> 00:17:13.920
 get that gig was the fact that in the '60s,

00:17:13.920 --> 00:17:16.800
 she'd been in Czechoslovakia,

00:17:16.800 --> 00:17:19.480
 and I think she was working for a multiple sclerosis foundation,

00:17:19.480 --> 00:17:20.680
 which is where she got her taste

00:17:20.680 --> 00:17:22.400
 for international diplomacy and stuff,

00:17:22.400 --> 00:17:23.920
 so her brother had MS,

00:17:23.920 --> 00:17:26.280
 and so she founded this organization.

00:17:26.280 --> 00:17:28.640
 She was doing some international work in Czechoslovakia,

00:17:28.640 --> 00:17:31.440
 and she happened to be there at the time

00:17:31.440 --> 00:17:32.760
 that the Russians basically invaded

00:17:32.760 --> 00:17:35.440
 to crush the uprising, to crush the Prague Spring,

00:17:35.440 --> 00:17:38.680
 and yeah, she remembers watching from her balcony

00:17:38.680 --> 00:17:40.240
 as a woman got gunned down,

00:17:40.240 --> 00:17:42.080
 and that made her think, yeah,

00:17:42.080 --> 00:17:43.960
 I'll take a career in diplomacy.

00:17:43.960 --> 00:17:44.800
 (laughing)

00:17:44.800 --> 00:17:46.240
 - Yeah, the other thing was that she married

00:17:46.240 --> 00:17:49.440
 her second husband in, I think, in her 30s,

00:17:49.440 --> 00:17:52.560
 and he was an aquaculture engineer and oceanographer,

00:17:52.560 --> 00:17:55.360
 so that also got her to go into the environmental side

00:17:55.360 --> 00:17:57.160
 of diplomacy, so that was part of it.

00:17:57.160 --> 00:18:00.360
 - She's really, I mean, so she did have political ambitions

00:18:00.360 --> 00:18:01.680
 outside of being an ambassador.

00:18:01.680 --> 00:18:04.880
 She was a Republican candidate.

00:18:04.880 --> 00:18:07.800
 She wanted to run for the House of Representatives in 1967,

00:18:07.800 --> 00:18:11.600
 and she lost out to a guy called Congressman Pete McCloskey,

00:18:11.600 --> 00:18:14.720
 but she obviously had close relationships

00:18:14.720 --> 00:18:16.480
 with the leading Republicans at the time,

00:18:16.480 --> 00:18:18.080
 because it was under Gerald Ford

00:18:18.080 --> 00:18:20.240
 that she was the ambassador to Ghana.

00:18:20.240 --> 00:18:22.840
 She was under Ronald Reagan when she did another

00:18:22.840 --> 00:18:24.800
 of her posts, and then the Czechoslovakia one

00:18:24.800 --> 00:18:28.400
 was George H.W. Bush, Bush Sr.

00:18:28.400 --> 00:18:30.200
 She must have been really good mates with them,

00:18:30.200 --> 00:18:33.080
 and you can see that this child stock,

00:18:33.080 --> 00:18:35.560
 'cause Shirley Temple really is even to my generation.

00:18:35.560 --> 00:18:37.680
 I used to watch her movies in black and white as a kid.

00:18:37.680 --> 00:18:39.680
 Like, I know-- - When were you born?

00:18:39.680 --> 00:18:41.760
 (laughing)

00:18:41.760 --> 00:18:43.400
 - Danny, you're 100 years old.

00:18:43.400 --> 00:18:44.600
 - Right, okay.

00:18:44.600 --> 00:18:46.880
 - Yeah, no, but no, like, she's still a name

00:18:46.880 --> 00:18:47.880
 that most of us know.

00:18:47.880 --> 00:18:50.520
 I mean, largely it might because of the drink,

00:18:50.520 --> 00:18:53.160
 the non-alcoholic mocktail that you can get.

00:18:53.160 --> 00:18:54.560
 - But before this, I thought Shirley Temple,

00:18:54.560 --> 00:18:57.720
 old child, sort of, like, curly hair, child actor,

00:18:57.720 --> 00:18:59.200
 like, hugely famous child star,

00:18:59.200 --> 00:19:00.520
 and also non-alcoholic drink.

00:19:00.520 --> 00:19:02.240
 - I only thought Good Ship Lollipop,

00:19:02.240 --> 00:19:03.800
 which was that song that she sang.

00:19:03.800 --> 00:19:05.160
 That's basically all I know about.

00:19:05.160 --> 00:19:06.480
 - But in a lot of her early films,

00:19:06.480 --> 00:19:08.680
 she preaches fiscal responsibility,

00:19:08.680 --> 00:19:11.800
 and the importance of a low-tax, small state.

00:19:11.800 --> 00:19:13.040
 So it's kind of unsurprising that her--

00:19:13.040 --> 00:19:14.880
 - That's who we should have seen it, actually.

00:19:14.880 --> 00:19:17.360
 - She was an independent Republican candidate,

00:19:17.360 --> 00:19:20.080
 I think, for the 1967 election

00:19:20.080 --> 00:19:22.400
 to be a part of the U.S. House of Representatives.

00:19:22.400 --> 00:19:23.240
 - What does that mean in the end?

00:19:23.240 --> 00:19:25.920
 - I believe that it means she was Republican,

00:19:25.920 --> 00:19:28.440
 but she wasn't officially on the ticket, I think.

00:19:28.440 --> 00:19:29.840
 I'm not sure about that.

00:19:29.840 --> 00:19:31.520
 But she said during the election,

00:19:31.520 --> 00:19:33.720
 "I think men are fine and here to stay,

00:19:33.720 --> 00:19:35.240
 "but I have a hunch that it wouldn't hurt

00:19:35.240 --> 00:19:37.000
 "to have a woman's viewpoint expressed

00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:39.240
 "in that delegation of 38 men."

00:19:39.240 --> 00:19:42.120
 - Mmm, yeah. - Too much too soon, Shirley.

00:19:42.120 --> 00:19:43.400
 (laughing)

00:19:43.400 --> 00:19:45.680
 - She started, okay, so she's a child actor, as we know,

00:19:45.680 --> 00:19:47.280
 in sort of like age six.

00:19:47.280 --> 00:19:49.600
 She was already winning like special Oscars

00:19:49.600 --> 00:19:50.840
 that were being given to her.

00:19:50.840 --> 00:19:51.760
 Like, she was a big deal.

00:19:51.760 --> 00:19:53.840
 What's, I did not know this.

00:19:53.840 --> 00:19:56.320
 There's something quite seedy about her intro

00:19:56.320 --> 00:19:57.880
 into the world of acting.

00:19:57.880 --> 00:19:59.040
 Nothing against her.

00:19:59.040 --> 00:20:00.680
 It's her parents who obviously signed her up.

00:20:00.680 --> 00:20:02.760
 She was three at the time, you know.

00:20:02.760 --> 00:20:05.920
 And it was part of this thing called baby burlesques.

00:20:05.920 --> 00:20:08.360
 - Yes, it's incredibly weird.

00:20:08.360 --> 00:20:09.360
 - Yeah, did you watch it?

00:20:09.360 --> 00:20:10.200
 'Cause I didn't.

00:20:10.200 --> 00:20:12.960
 (laughing)

00:20:12.960 --> 00:20:15.400
 - The bad news is we've all had our laptops taken away.

00:20:15.400 --> 00:20:17.280
 (laughing)

00:20:17.280 --> 00:20:18.560
 Is it online, I assume, or is it not?

00:20:18.560 --> 00:20:19.880
 - It must be somewhere, right?

00:20:19.880 --> 00:20:21.640
 - It must be historical.

00:20:21.640 --> 00:20:22.560
 - 'Cause it's quite obscure.

00:20:22.560 --> 00:20:23.640
 It's like early 30s.

00:20:23.640 --> 00:20:24.480
 I think it's hard.

00:20:24.480 --> 00:20:25.520
 I couldn't find an online version.

00:20:25.520 --> 00:20:26.840
 There's one film which I reckon you can get

00:20:26.840 --> 00:20:27.880
 on YouTube if you tried.

00:20:27.880 --> 00:20:29.440
 - Oh, it's on the dark web.

00:20:29.440 --> 00:20:31.880
 (laughing)

00:20:31.880 --> 00:20:33.720
 - So what, yeah, sorry, Dad, you should tell what it was.

00:20:33.720 --> 00:20:35.720
 - Yeah, okay, so it's described by The New York Times

00:20:35.720 --> 00:20:38.280
 as a series of sexually suggestive one real shorts

00:20:38.280 --> 00:20:40.560
 in which children played all the roles.

00:20:40.560 --> 00:20:42.760
 - Yeah, so what it was is basically

00:20:42.760 --> 00:20:45.720
 they were parodies of films for grown-ups.

00:20:45.720 --> 00:20:49.040
 So at the time, all the grown-up stars

00:20:49.040 --> 00:20:51.840
 were people like Marlena Dietrich and Mae West,

00:20:51.840 --> 00:20:54.880
 and they were obviously very sexy women

00:20:54.880 --> 00:20:56.480
 with very flirtatious dialogue.

00:20:56.480 --> 00:20:57.400
 And these baby burlesques,

00:20:57.400 --> 00:21:00.240
 they kind of did parody versions of these films

00:21:00.240 --> 00:21:02.200
 where there are children playing the roles.

00:21:02.200 --> 00:21:03.720
 - Like Bugsie Malone, I guess, right?

00:21:03.720 --> 00:21:04.960
 Is like a close version of it.

00:21:04.960 --> 00:21:07.200
 - Yeah, but not with like saucy dialogue.

00:21:07.200 --> 00:21:08.960
 - It's so weird. - I'm a three-year-old.

00:21:08.960 --> 00:21:09.960
 - So weird.

00:21:09.960 --> 00:21:11.960
 - In defense of the olden days.

00:21:11.960 --> 00:21:14.000
 - Oh, come on. - I think it was probably okay.

00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:16.960
 It was a comedy, and they wore,

00:21:16.960 --> 00:21:19.840
 so they'd wear sexy outfits on the top half,

00:21:19.840 --> 00:21:21.560
 and then they'd have their nappies on,

00:21:21.560 --> 00:21:22.720
 on the bottom half,

00:21:22.720 --> 00:21:24.960
 like they're doing kind of a Zoom meeting from home.

00:21:24.960 --> 00:21:26.800
 (laughing)

00:21:26.800 --> 00:21:28.200
 - I don't think it would get made today.

00:21:28.200 --> 00:21:29.360
 - No. - And the stories

00:21:29.360 --> 00:21:30.880
 that Shirley Temple would tell about it

00:21:30.880 --> 00:21:32.440
 in later in her autobiography,

00:21:32.440 --> 00:21:34.280
 where she'd say that if they got in trouble,

00:21:34.280 --> 00:21:37.320
 the kids that were part of this production

00:21:37.320 --> 00:21:39.160
 would be sent off to a sound booth

00:21:39.160 --> 00:21:41.120
 where they'd have to sit on a block of ice.

00:21:41.120 --> 00:21:43.440
 - Apparently, every night,

00:21:43.440 --> 00:21:46.040
 Shirley Temple's mother would curl her hair

00:21:46.040 --> 00:21:48.400
 into 56 perfect curls,

00:21:48.400 --> 00:21:49.520
 so she would have to sit there

00:21:49.520 --> 00:21:51.520
 and do her hair every single night.

00:21:51.520 --> 00:21:53.600
 And then she would be read a bedtime story,

00:21:53.600 --> 00:21:56.000
 but the bedtime story was the next day's script

00:21:56.000 --> 00:21:57.480
 that she had to learn.

00:21:57.480 --> 00:21:59.560
 And so the mother would read the lines from the script,

00:21:59.560 --> 00:22:00.880
 and she'd have to parrot them back,

00:22:00.880 --> 00:22:02.560
 and she'd keep doing that until she fell asleep.

00:22:02.560 --> 00:22:03.760
 - So Shirley Temple's mom got her,

00:22:03.760 --> 00:22:06.800
 she does sound like a proper, classic,

00:22:06.800 --> 00:22:10.600
 good old fashioned Hollywood insane pushy mum, as in.

00:22:10.600 --> 00:22:13.680
 She ensured that other child actors

00:22:13.680 --> 00:22:15.120
 who might threaten her daughter's roles

00:22:15.120 --> 00:22:16.680
 had their parts cut.

00:22:16.680 --> 00:22:17.520
 - Which parts?

00:22:17.520 --> 00:22:19.240
 (laughing)

00:22:19.240 --> 00:22:21.600
 Body parts. - Fingers, yeah, yeah.

00:22:21.600 --> 00:22:23.520
 And so she was very protective,

00:22:23.520 --> 00:22:26.760
 very, very forceful in getting Shirley too fame.

00:22:26.760 --> 00:22:30.240
 Also, one thing she stole from Shirley Temple herself

00:22:30.240 --> 00:22:31.800
 was the year of her life.

00:22:31.800 --> 00:22:33.960
 She knocked a year off Shirley Temple's age.

00:22:33.960 --> 00:22:35.280
 So Shirley was at her--

00:22:35.280 --> 00:22:37.040
 - That's actually giving someone an extra year.

00:22:37.040 --> 00:22:39.400
 - Oh my God, she's the perfect mum.

00:22:39.400 --> 00:22:40.240
 (laughing)

00:22:40.240 --> 00:22:42.040
 - I mean, if my mum could suddenly turn around

00:22:42.040 --> 00:22:44.440
 and say that I'm 35, that'd be great.

00:22:44.440 --> 00:22:45.440
 - Well, no, but she wouldn't be.

00:22:45.440 --> 00:22:47.200
 She'd be telling you a year, as in,

00:22:47.200 --> 00:22:50.640
 so Shirley Temple was at her 12th birthday party,

00:22:50.640 --> 00:22:52.600
 and her mum said, "Oh, by the way, you're 13."

00:22:52.600 --> 00:22:55.520
 - Ah, well, but when she was nine,

00:22:55.520 --> 00:22:56.800
 they said that she was eight.

00:22:56.800 --> 00:22:58.800
 - But that's why, so that's because

00:22:58.800 --> 00:23:00.160
 it's all part of the same story.

00:23:00.160 --> 00:23:01.000
 - It's all the same process.

00:23:01.000 --> 00:23:03.760
 See, when she was three or four, her mum thought,

00:23:03.760 --> 00:23:05.080
 "Oh no, she's getting a bit too old

00:23:05.080 --> 00:23:06.720
 "for this whole baby game."

00:23:06.720 --> 00:23:07.800
 Like, she's about to be,

00:23:07.800 --> 00:23:09.600
 no, I think she was about to turn five and a half

00:23:09.600 --> 00:23:10.680
 or something, so her mum was like,

00:23:10.680 --> 00:23:12.520
 "Right, we're gonna make her four and a half again."

00:23:12.520 --> 00:23:14.800
 And then Shirley, from the age of four and a half,

00:23:14.800 --> 00:23:16.520
 thought that she was four and a half,

00:23:16.520 --> 00:23:17.360
 five and a half, six and a half,

00:23:17.360 --> 00:23:18.800
 and then it was when she was 12

00:23:18.800 --> 00:23:20.960
 that her mum went, "Actually, surprise."

00:23:20.960 --> 00:23:22.040
 Welcome to a teenagerhood.

00:23:22.040 --> 00:23:24.360
 - She's like turning the clock back in the autumn

00:23:24.360 --> 00:23:26.080
 and turning it forward again in the spring.

00:23:26.080 --> 00:23:27.160
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. - Exactly.

00:23:27.160 --> 00:23:28.760
 - So your mum could do this for you, James,

00:23:28.760 --> 00:23:30.800
 but you'd be on borrowed time.

00:23:30.840 --> 00:23:34.080
 - I'm perhaps borrowing time at this stage of my life.

00:23:34.080 --> 00:23:37.160
 I am up for borrowing any time I can borrow.

00:23:37.160 --> 00:23:41.040
 And on her eighth birthday, so she was actually nine,

00:23:41.040 --> 00:23:43.280
 but she was, I thought she was eight,

00:23:43.280 --> 00:23:46.600
 she got 135,000 gifts.

00:23:46.600 --> 00:23:48.480
 - Yeah, that's amazing, isn't it?

00:23:48.480 --> 00:23:49.600
 - Pretty amazing.

00:23:49.600 --> 00:23:51.960
 And it was sent to her by fans around the world, right?

00:23:51.960 --> 00:23:53.120
 - No, all from her mum. - It wasn't just her parents,

00:23:53.120 --> 00:23:54.720
 yeah, her mum was, yeah.

00:23:54.720 --> 00:23:58.000
 - She got a kangaroo from Australia.

00:23:58.000 --> 00:23:59.600
 - That's a burden, anything. - What?

00:23:59.600 --> 00:24:00.440
 - Is it?

00:24:00.440 --> 00:24:02.280
 Well, you can keep other presents in the pouch.

00:24:02.280 --> 00:24:05.200
 - Good point, guys, it's a suitcase.

00:24:05.200 --> 00:24:08.400
 - Yeah, it sounds, her life just sounds insane.

00:24:08.400 --> 00:24:11.360
 She was the biggest box office star of the year

00:24:11.360 --> 00:24:13.320
 in 1936, '37, and '38,

00:24:13.320 --> 00:24:15.080
 which I think were the years where she was eight, nine,

00:24:15.080 --> 00:24:16.520
 and 10, I mean.

00:24:16.520 --> 00:24:18.400
 - She's the biggest child star that's ever been.

00:24:18.400 --> 00:24:20.280
 There's been no contest ever since, really.

00:24:20.280 --> 00:24:22.400
 - Carly Culkin is the only other one I could think of.

00:24:22.400 --> 00:24:24.840
 - I think in terms of the amount she earned at the time,

00:24:24.840 --> 00:24:26.600
 the fact that she was the only person

00:24:26.600 --> 00:24:28.200
 anyone wanted in any films,

00:24:28.200 --> 00:24:29.480
 between the ages of three and 10,

00:24:29.480 --> 00:24:31.240
 she was in 29 films.

00:24:31.240 --> 00:24:35.080
 1935, her salary was $2,500 a week.

00:24:35.080 --> 00:24:37.840
 This is when she was seven, six or seven.

00:24:37.840 --> 00:24:39.160
 - That was a lot of money in those days.

00:24:39.160 --> 00:24:42.360
 It wasn't just like a third of a tincture of Iron Moss.

00:24:42.360 --> 00:24:47.120
 - God, her house was stuffed with Iron Moss though, wow.

00:24:47.120 --> 00:24:48.680
 She was also responsible

00:24:48.680 --> 00:24:51.600
 for quite a random bit of cultural input, possibly,

00:24:51.600 --> 00:24:54.120
 and that is the Novel, The Power and the Glory.

00:24:54.120 --> 00:24:54.960
 - Okay.

00:24:54.960 --> 00:24:58.240
 - By Graham Greene, and this is because

00:24:58.240 --> 00:25:00.280
 she had sort of a feud with Graham Greene

00:25:00.280 --> 00:25:02.800
 at the age of sort of nine, eight or nine.

00:25:02.800 --> 00:25:05.560
 - It's so funny, I didn't celebrate with you.

00:25:05.560 --> 00:25:08.560
 - Do you remember in the 90s or the early 2000s,

00:25:08.560 --> 00:25:10.640
 they used to have celebrity boxing

00:25:10.640 --> 00:25:12.680
 and like Ricky Gervais fought with,

00:25:12.680 --> 00:25:14.360
 I don't know, some random person.

00:25:14.360 --> 00:25:15.200
 - Did they?

00:25:15.200 --> 00:25:16.040
 - Yeah, yeah.

00:25:16.040 --> 00:25:16.880
 - I don't remember that.

00:25:16.880 --> 00:25:18.360
 - Like Patrick Kilty or something like that, yeah.

00:25:18.360 --> 00:25:21.720
 - I just want to see Graham Greene in Shirley Temple.

00:25:21.720 --> 00:25:22.960
 - Clocking Shirley Temple.

00:25:22.960 --> 00:25:25.320
 - That is a pay-per-view I would pay for.

00:25:25.320 --> 00:25:26.640
 - I think I'd back Shirley.

00:25:26.640 --> 00:25:29.440
 She was pretty tough under those ringlets.

00:25:29.440 --> 00:25:30.560
 He was quite mean about her.

00:25:30.560 --> 00:25:33.520
 He wrote a review of her films saying,

00:25:33.520 --> 00:25:35.600
 sort of suggesting that she was trained

00:25:35.600 --> 00:25:37.960
 to deliberately be a bit cocket-ish.

00:25:37.960 --> 00:25:40.320
 Saying she symbolized dimpled depravity.

00:25:40.320 --> 00:25:41.880
 She had a well-developed rump.

00:25:41.880 --> 00:25:44.560
 And suggesting that her films were targeting

00:25:44.560 --> 00:25:45.800
 sleazy middle-aged men.

00:25:45.800 --> 00:25:49.440
 And it's unclear how humorous he was being.

00:25:49.440 --> 00:25:51.360
 Having read it, I don't think he was being that humorous.

00:25:51.360 --> 00:25:53.280
 I think it was just a pretty nasty review.

00:25:53.280 --> 00:25:57.640
 And then her mum and Fox decided to sue him for slander,

00:25:57.640 --> 00:25:59.520
 for saying that, for suggesting that.

00:25:59.520 --> 00:26:02.920
 And he, according to a friend who wrote a biography of him,

00:26:02.920 --> 00:26:07.080
 years later, he realized that he was about to be sued.

00:26:07.080 --> 00:26:08.800
 And so he might go to prison.

00:26:08.800 --> 00:26:12.280
 So he fled from England, where he was, to Mexico,

00:26:12.280 --> 00:26:14.200
 which didn't have any extradition rules.

00:26:14.200 --> 00:26:17.680
 And in Mexico, that was where he was inspired to write,

00:26:17.680 --> 00:26:19.520
 maybe his greatest magnum opus,

00:26:19.520 --> 00:26:21.080
 Para and the Glory, set in Mexico.

00:26:21.080 --> 00:26:21.920
 - Done a case.

00:26:21.920 --> 00:26:22.760
 - About oppression of Catholics.

00:26:22.760 --> 00:26:26.520
 - As an adult, she broke the ice, whatever,

00:26:26.520 --> 00:26:27.600
 she sent him a copy.

00:26:27.600 --> 00:26:29.560
 - She was been sitting on all that time.

00:26:29.560 --> 00:26:31.160
 - She sent him a copy of her autobiography,

00:26:31.160 --> 00:26:32.400
 and she invited him to tea.

00:26:32.400 --> 00:26:34.560
 So clearly there weren't very many hard feelings

00:26:34.560 --> 00:26:35.960
 on her part.

00:26:35.960 --> 00:26:37.480
 - Well, she was a diplomat, wasn't she?

00:26:37.480 --> 00:26:38.800
 - Oh, yeah, there you go.

00:26:38.800 --> 00:26:41.160
 - Well, she had got 3,500 pounds

00:26:41.160 --> 00:26:43.320
 from Graham Greene in the settlement.

00:26:43.320 --> 00:26:44.680
 - I wonder how much she saw of that, though.

00:26:44.680 --> 00:26:45.880
 I haven't got this written down,

00:26:45.880 --> 00:26:47.440
 but I do, in the course of reading,

00:26:47.440 --> 00:26:49.400
 remember that a lot of the money was taken

00:26:49.400 --> 00:26:51.800
 by the parents and wasn't seen by Shirley.

00:26:51.800 --> 00:26:52.920
 So I've got the figures.

00:26:52.920 --> 00:26:53.760
 - Yeah, what are they?

00:26:53.760 --> 00:26:57.920
 - Right, she earned $3,200,000 in her acting career,

00:26:57.920 --> 00:26:59.280
 quite a lot of money at the time.

00:26:59.280 --> 00:27:01.360
 By the time she was 22 years old,

00:27:01.360 --> 00:27:03.240
 there was $44,000 left.

00:27:03.240 --> 00:27:05.040
 - And was that because it was depleted by her parents?

00:27:05.040 --> 00:27:06.240
 - It was her dad, right?

00:27:06.240 --> 00:27:08.000
 So her dad was a banker,

00:27:08.000 --> 00:27:10.880
 and so he was in charge of all of her money,

00:27:10.880 --> 00:27:13.040
 obviously her parents, they would be,

00:27:13.040 --> 00:27:14.360
 but she'd never blamed him.

00:27:14.360 --> 00:27:16.000
 She reckons that he got duped.

00:27:16.000 --> 00:27:18.160
 So basically he made a load of bad investments

00:27:18.160 --> 00:27:20.200
 because people could see he was making a load of money,

00:27:20.200 --> 00:27:22.480
 and he didn't really, you know, he wasn't the greatest.

00:27:22.480 --> 00:27:24.040
 He left school when he was in seventh grade.

00:27:24.040 --> 00:27:25.880
 He wasn't the greatest banker of all time.

00:27:25.880 --> 00:27:26.720
 - I wonder if she was a banker?

00:27:26.720 --> 00:27:29.000
 He was kind of like a monopoly banker, basically.

00:27:29.000 --> 00:27:30.400
 "I'll be the banker, yeah, great."

00:27:30.400 --> 00:27:31.920
 - They should have looked underneath the bar.

00:27:31.920 --> 00:27:33.320
 That's where the money would have been.

00:27:33.320 --> 00:27:35.640
 But yeah, she said that she didn't blame him one little bit,

00:27:35.640 --> 00:27:37.760
 and it was the people that counseled him

00:27:37.760 --> 00:27:39.560
 who were the bad guys. - Who were the baddies, okay.

00:27:39.560 --> 00:27:42.520
 - Just a quite a nice link between her past

00:27:42.520 --> 00:27:44.560
 and her sort of future,

00:27:44.560 --> 00:27:47.080
 if you're placing yourself in 1940.

00:27:47.080 --> 00:27:48.440
 It goes back to this fact,

00:27:48.440 --> 00:27:49.600
 James' fact at the start of the show,

00:27:49.600 --> 00:27:51.040
 so when communism fell.

00:27:51.040 --> 00:27:53.520
 So basically, she never liked references

00:27:53.520 --> 00:27:55.720
 to her history as a child star, you know.

00:27:55.720 --> 00:27:57.000
 She would say it's not for everyone.

00:27:57.000 --> 00:27:57.840
 Everyone was a child.

00:27:57.840 --> 00:27:59.240
 How come I'm the only one who,

00:27:59.240 --> 00:28:02.320
 as a very high achieving diplomat and politician,

00:28:02.320 --> 00:28:05.000
 you know, gets labeled as former child star?

00:28:05.000 --> 00:28:06.400
 - Well, not everyone.

00:28:06.400 --> 00:28:09.240
 Like, that kind of havel wasn't in movies.

00:28:09.240 --> 00:28:12.080
 - We don't know.

00:28:12.080 --> 00:28:14.040
 There might have been some obscured Czech films

00:28:14.040 --> 00:28:18.080
 undiscovered with him spouting philosophy age nine.

00:28:18.080 --> 00:28:20.360
 But she did give them a treat just once.

00:28:20.360 --> 00:28:23.120
 So it was when communism did fall in Czechoslovakia,

00:28:23.120 --> 00:28:24.760
 big day, very exciting.

00:28:24.760 --> 00:28:26.920
 She called all of her senior staff together,

00:28:26.920 --> 00:28:28.360
 shut the doors, very private room,

00:28:28.360 --> 00:28:30.720
 and apparently looked them very sternly in the eye

00:28:30.720 --> 00:28:33.000
 and said, "I'm only going to do this once."

00:28:33.000 --> 00:28:34.400
 And then she started prancing around the room

00:28:34.400 --> 00:28:35.720
 and singing on the good chip lot.

00:28:35.720 --> 00:28:37.440
 (all laughing)

00:28:37.440 --> 00:28:39.280
 - That's amazing. - It's awesome.

00:28:39.280 --> 00:28:42.200
 - I've just got one thing on child stars

00:28:42.200 --> 00:28:44.160
 and how to become a child star, because--

00:28:44.160 --> 00:28:45.000
 - A bit late for us.

00:28:45.000 --> 00:28:46.640
 - A bit late for us, but you know,

00:28:46.640 --> 00:28:48.000
 I've got a kid on the way,

00:28:48.000 --> 00:28:50.880
 so I could actually get going on this,

00:28:50.880 --> 00:28:53.440
 which is there's a company called Jam 2000,

00:28:53.440 --> 00:28:55.120
 and they're the agency that basically,

00:28:55.120 --> 00:28:57.240
 when you see a baby in the UK on TV

00:28:57.240 --> 00:28:59.960
 and call the midwife, even the crown or Sherlock,

00:28:59.960 --> 00:29:01.360
 if there's a baby in it,

00:29:01.360 --> 00:29:03.880
 it's a good chance that Jam 2000 gave them.

00:29:03.880 --> 00:29:05.960
 So when the baby is born,

00:29:05.960 --> 00:29:07.440
 the baby can get an acting license

00:29:07.440 --> 00:29:09.360
 within a few hours of being born.

00:29:09.360 --> 00:29:11.120
 In America, it takes about 15 days.

00:29:11.120 --> 00:29:13.600
 You've got to be 15 days old to get a worker's permit

00:29:13.600 --> 00:29:14.720
 or acting. - How do you,

00:29:14.720 --> 00:29:16.520
 do you need to audition?

00:29:16.520 --> 00:29:18.360
 Like, when you're coming out of the birth canal,

00:29:18.360 --> 00:29:20.440
 you're like, "Mary, come lie down."

00:29:20.440 --> 00:29:21.280
 - Exactly.

00:29:21.280 --> 00:29:22.120
 So that's the issue.

00:29:22.120 --> 00:29:23.640
 They say that often people complain,

00:29:23.640 --> 00:29:25.000
 like, "This baby's crying all the time."

00:29:25.000 --> 00:29:26.560
 They say, "Well, you just happened to have

00:29:26.560 --> 00:29:27.720
 been given a crying baby."

00:29:27.720 --> 00:29:29.360
 Unfortunately, that's the case.

00:29:29.360 --> 00:29:31.800
 But they do have specifications that they like,

00:29:31.800 --> 00:29:35.920
 so triplets or twins are particularly liked,

00:29:35.920 --> 00:29:37.680
 because twins, most likely,

00:29:37.680 --> 00:29:39.160
 you're gonna be born three weeks early.

00:29:39.160 --> 00:29:42.360
 Triplets, in some cases, seven weeks early, right?

00:29:42.360 --> 00:29:43.400
 - Is that good?

00:29:43.400 --> 00:29:44.680
 - It's good. - I guess they'll be extra small

00:29:44.680 --> 00:29:46.640
 'cause they can get older and they can look newborn.

00:29:46.640 --> 00:29:47.480
 - Exactly.

00:29:47.480 --> 00:29:49.000
 - I actually thought it would be that

00:29:49.000 --> 00:29:51.120
 they would only have to work for 20 minutes at a time

00:29:51.120 --> 00:29:52.720
 'cause you can keep swapping them in and out.

00:29:52.720 --> 00:29:54.080
 - That's the other reason.

00:29:54.080 --> 00:29:55.680
 So when they're looking for tiny babies,

00:29:55.680 --> 00:29:56.640
 twins are fantastic.

00:29:56.640 --> 00:29:58.240
 They're tiny, but you can do double time

00:29:58.240 --> 00:30:00.480
 because you've got two babies to swap in there.

00:30:00.480 --> 00:30:02.560
 - Oh, babies look almost identical anyway.

00:30:02.560 --> 00:30:03.920
 - So you would think so, right?

00:30:03.920 --> 00:30:06.880
 But sometimes it's to do with hair and sometimes to do,

00:30:06.880 --> 00:30:08.720
 but yeah, so the youngest that this company said

00:30:08.720 --> 00:30:11.120
 that they've ever handed over as a four-day-old baby

00:30:11.120 --> 00:30:12.720
 in order to be used.

00:30:12.720 --> 00:30:13.560
 - Amazing.

00:30:13.560 --> 00:30:14.920
 - And so it's a great article

00:30:14.920 --> 00:30:16.280
 where it just tells you about different types

00:30:16.280 --> 00:30:18.320
 babies have been using and just a little nugget

00:30:18.320 --> 00:30:19.880
 for any Star Wars fans out there.

00:30:19.880 --> 00:30:21.400
 In Star Wars Revenge of the Sith,

00:30:21.400 --> 00:30:24.600
 we get to see Luke and Leia, who are twins that are born.

00:30:24.600 --> 00:30:26.680
 - Wait, that's episode three.

00:30:26.680 --> 00:30:27.720
 - Three, yeah.

00:30:27.720 --> 00:30:29.480
 - So you get to see them as babies

00:30:29.480 --> 00:30:31.400
 and that's where you learn that their brother and sister

00:30:31.400 --> 00:30:35.240
 in the series and the babies that were used for that

00:30:35.240 --> 00:30:39.120
 were actually one, which was a guy called Aidan Barton.

00:30:39.120 --> 00:30:41.440
 He plays both Luke and Leia.

00:30:41.440 --> 00:30:42.280
 - Really?

00:30:42.280 --> 00:30:43.120
 - So when you look at them--

00:30:43.120 --> 00:30:45.080
 - He's like, "Alex Guinness in kind hearts and coronets."

00:30:45.080 --> 00:30:46.200
 (laughing)

00:30:46.200 --> 00:30:49.040
 - Yeah, he's Eddie Murphy and then meet--

00:30:49.040 --> 00:30:50.400
 - What a reference to you to make James.

00:30:50.400 --> 00:30:52.320
 From somebody who hasn't seen any films made before

00:30:52.320 --> 00:30:54.680
 about 1987, for you to make a kind hearts and coronets

00:30:54.680 --> 00:30:56.240
 reference, what have you done with James?

00:30:56.240 --> 00:30:58.080
 - That's just somebody who does a lot of quizzes.

00:30:58.080 --> 00:31:00.280
 (laughing)

00:31:00.280 --> 00:31:02.080
 Sorry, yeah, I've not seen Star Wars.

00:31:02.080 --> 00:31:03.120
 What are you talking about?

00:31:03.120 --> 00:31:04.200
 - So-- - Twins.

00:31:04.200 --> 00:31:05.880
 - Also, can I, can I, quick, quick, sorry.

00:31:05.880 --> 00:31:06.840
 - No, no, no, no, I know what you're gonna say

00:31:06.840 --> 00:31:08.200
 and don't say it because we're going--

00:31:08.200 --> 00:31:09.200
 - The point of which you find out in the series

00:31:09.200 --> 00:31:10.440
 that Luke and Leia are siblings.

00:31:10.440 --> 00:31:13.040
 - Yeah, if you start at episode one like a psychopath.

00:31:13.040 --> 00:31:14.200
 - James, where would you start?

00:31:14.200 --> 00:31:15.040
 - One.

00:31:15.040 --> 00:31:15.880
 - There we go.

00:31:15.880 --> 00:31:16.720
 When's he gonna find out?

00:31:16.720 --> 00:31:18.280
 - Come on, you've asked James the only person

00:31:18.280 --> 00:31:20.440
 who doesn't know when to start watching Star Wars

00:31:20.440 --> 00:31:22.200
 and I think that's an unfair sample.

00:31:22.200 --> 00:31:24.960
 - It's the first episode, there's a second episode

00:31:24.960 --> 00:31:25.800
 that you find out.

00:31:25.800 --> 00:31:26.640
 - Presumably, they wouldn't have called

00:31:26.640 --> 00:31:27.680
 them episode one, two, and three

00:31:27.680 --> 00:31:29.680
 if they didn't want you to watch them first, would they?

00:31:29.680 --> 00:31:31.000
 - Absolutely, no, no, no.

00:31:31.000 --> 00:31:32.680
 - It's absolutely correct.

00:31:32.680 --> 00:31:33.920
 Jabba the Hutt was actually played

00:31:33.920 --> 00:31:36.680
 by a six-week-old baby on that episode.

00:31:36.680 --> 00:31:38.020
 Very overfed.

00:31:38.020 --> 00:31:40.600
 (upbeat music)

00:31:40.600 --> 00:31:45.720
 Okay, it is time for fact number three

00:31:45.720 --> 00:31:46.980
 and that is my fact.

00:31:46.980 --> 00:31:49.500
 My fact this week is that there used to be a cinema

00:31:49.500 --> 00:31:51.920
 in Melbourne, Australia that had a cloakroom

00:31:51.920 --> 00:31:53.440
 to keep your babies in.

00:31:53.440 --> 00:31:54.760
 (laughing)

00:31:54.760 --> 00:31:55.800
 What?

00:31:55.800 --> 00:31:58.020
 So this was called the Sun Theater

00:31:58.020 --> 00:32:00.560
 and this was a place where when you were arriving

00:32:00.560 --> 00:32:02.180
 at the cinema, you would have a cloakroom

00:32:02.180 --> 00:32:03.740
 but rather than leaving your coat in there,

00:32:03.740 --> 00:32:06.960
 you would push your baby in its pram into the cloakroom,

00:32:06.960 --> 00:32:09.420
 be given a ticket, and then go watch the movie.

00:32:09.420 --> 00:32:11.180
 Now, obviously you don't want to completely abandon

00:32:11.180 --> 00:32:13.260
 your baby, so while you're watching the movie,

00:32:13.260 --> 00:32:15.780
 if your baby in the cloakroom kicks off

00:32:15.780 --> 00:32:17.820
 and starts crying inconsolably,

00:32:17.820 --> 00:32:20.240
 the ticket number that you hold will flash up

00:32:20.240 --> 00:32:22.260
 on the screen of the movie to let you know

00:32:22.260 --> 00:32:24.100
 that you're desperately needed in the cloakroom

00:32:24.100 --> 00:32:26.140
 so you can get out and look after your baby.

00:32:26.140 --> 00:32:26.980
 - It's very clever.

00:32:26.980 --> 00:32:27.820
 - Brilliant.

00:32:27.820 --> 00:32:29.740
 - Hang on, would it flash up for all the other members

00:32:29.740 --> 00:32:30.580
 of the audience?

00:32:30.580 --> 00:32:32.220
 Is it gonna replace the image that was on the screen

00:32:32.220 --> 00:32:34.020
 or is it a little thing in the corner that's subtle?

00:32:34.020 --> 00:32:36.500
 - Like, I think just a quick superimpose

00:32:36.500 --> 00:32:37.780
 at the number 29, whatever.

00:32:37.780 --> 00:32:39.120
 - Really, on the screen, mid-film?

00:32:39.120 --> 00:32:39.960
 - I think that would be all right.

00:32:39.960 --> 00:32:41.560
 - But be mid-film, I don't know if it would be

00:32:41.560 --> 00:32:43.320
 directly over the whole thing, it might be in the corner.

00:32:43.320 --> 00:32:44.800
 I couldn't actually find that out.

00:32:44.800 --> 00:32:46.160
 - It's a must-be corner.

00:32:46.160 --> 00:32:47.000
 - I don't know.

00:32:47.000 --> 00:32:48.080
 - I'll be so annoying 'cause babies cry constantly

00:32:48.080 --> 00:32:51.480
 and if you've got 50 babies at a big blockbuster film

00:32:51.480 --> 00:32:53.680
 in the cloakroom, you're just gonna be watching a series

00:32:53.680 --> 00:32:55.520
 of numbers flashing up in the national lottery.

00:32:55.520 --> 00:32:56.360
 - Exactly.

00:32:56.360 --> 00:32:57.200
 (laughing)

00:32:57.200 --> 00:32:58.040
 - So this--

00:32:58.040 --> 00:32:58.880
 - It's ingenious.

00:32:58.880 --> 00:33:00.160
 - It was a very clever idea and this was--

00:33:00.160 --> 00:33:01.280
 - Why do we not have it today?

00:33:01.280 --> 00:33:02.280
 - Exactly, why don't we?

00:33:02.280 --> 00:33:03.120
 It seems like a very--

00:33:03.120 --> 00:33:05.240
 - 'Cause people don't think they should just leave their babies.

00:33:05.240 --> 00:33:06.760
 - Yeah, I don't think I'd leave my baby now

00:33:06.760 --> 00:33:08.680
 that I say that out loud.

00:33:08.680 --> 00:33:10.480
 - Well, your baby's probably in the movie.

00:33:10.480 --> 00:33:12.800
 - That's right, it's in the movie, yeah.

00:33:12.800 --> 00:33:14.000
 Well, you do have baby cinema now,

00:33:14.000 --> 00:33:15.680
 which we take my son to go and see.

00:33:15.680 --> 00:33:16.520
 - Yeah, I got to that.

00:33:16.520 --> 00:33:17.520
 - Yeah, we took--

00:33:17.520 --> 00:33:19.720
 - You really should take your child along sometimes.

00:33:19.720 --> 00:33:21.280
 - I know, I know.

00:33:21.280 --> 00:33:23.280
 - The first movie that we took, "Wilf" to see,

00:33:23.280 --> 00:33:25.800
 Fenella, my wife took "Wilf" to see was the movie

00:33:25.800 --> 00:33:27.300
 that was on the biopic of Churchill

00:33:27.300 --> 00:33:29.360
 that came out about four years back.

00:33:29.360 --> 00:33:31.880
 - So all the babies look like Churchill.

00:33:31.880 --> 00:33:33.320
 - Like "Wilf" was really into it

00:33:33.320 --> 00:33:35.840
 'cause he was like, "Wow, it's me in a suit when I'm older."

00:33:35.840 --> 00:33:37.880
 This is amazing.

00:33:37.880 --> 00:33:41.440
 So the Sun Theater had opened up in Melbourne in 1938

00:33:41.440 --> 00:33:42.960
 and it was a single screen theater.

00:33:42.960 --> 00:33:46.560
 It had 1,050 seats and it was really massive.

00:33:46.560 --> 00:33:48.920
 It was a big deal and then over time,

00:33:48.920 --> 00:33:51.320
 people stopped going as much and they had to sell

00:33:51.320 --> 00:33:54.240
 and new owners turned it into smaller screens.

00:33:54.240 --> 00:33:55.800
 So they stopped doing it.

00:33:55.800 --> 00:33:58.800
 It's no longer a, you don't bring your Pram in there anymore,

00:33:58.800 --> 00:34:00.120
 which is a shame.

00:34:00.120 --> 00:34:02.080
 - And I can't find any other cinema that did this.

00:34:02.080 --> 00:34:05.040
 - No, no, yeah. - I think it was just this one.

00:34:05.040 --> 00:34:08.320
 - There are people who've left their children

00:34:08.320 --> 00:34:09.600
 in cloak rooms before.

00:34:09.600 --> 00:34:11.680
 I won't go so far as to say, "This is a thing,"

00:34:11.680 --> 00:34:13.580
 because it's not.

00:34:13.580 --> 00:34:15.860
 But in 1999, Tony Blair's chief of staff

00:34:15.860 --> 00:34:17.840
 was a guy called Jonathan Powell and--

00:34:17.840 --> 00:34:19.400
 - Oh, I remember Powell.

00:34:19.400 --> 00:34:20.840
 Oh, those are the good old days, weren't they?

00:34:20.840 --> 00:34:21.840
 - Friend of Anna.

00:34:21.840 --> 00:34:24.740
 Anyway, he went to the Groucho Club

00:34:24.740 --> 00:34:26.040
 and left his eight-week-old daughter

00:34:26.040 --> 00:34:28.240
 with a cloakroom attendant and that was--

00:34:28.240 --> 00:34:30.360
 And there was a brief comment about it

00:34:30.360 --> 00:34:32.200
 and then the family complained saying,

00:34:32.200 --> 00:34:33.560
 "The child has a right to a private life,"

00:34:33.560 --> 00:34:34.640
 and I think the newspaper said,

00:34:34.640 --> 00:34:36.160
 "Well, don't leave the child in the cloakroom then."

00:34:36.160 --> 00:34:39.280
 Anyway, but the Observer sent a reporter

00:34:39.280 --> 00:34:41.880
 called Saskia Sessons, who took a colleague of hers,

00:34:41.880 --> 00:34:45.200
 five-month-old baby, to various cloakrooms all over London.

00:34:45.200 --> 00:34:47.400
 It's a great feature.

00:34:47.400 --> 00:34:49.920
 So King's Cross left luggage office?

00:34:49.920 --> 00:34:50.880
 Absolutely not.

00:34:50.880 --> 00:34:51.840
 The Ivy Restaurant?

00:34:51.840 --> 00:34:54.160
 Yes, please leave the baby with us.

00:34:54.160 --> 00:34:55.640
 We'll stash him on a ledge.

00:34:55.640 --> 00:34:58.720
 National Gallery were incredibly rude to Saskia

00:34:58.720 --> 00:35:00.200
 and her young friend.

00:35:00.200 --> 00:35:02.040
 One of the cloakroom attendants said,

00:35:02.040 --> 00:35:03.000
 "Out of the question."

00:35:03.000 --> 00:35:05.040
 The second said, "You need your head examined,"

00:35:05.040 --> 00:35:07.880
 and the third said, "That's very, very irresponsible."

00:35:07.880 --> 00:35:08.720
 - Get on, yeah. - I know.

00:35:08.720 --> 00:35:10.520
 - So, wait a minute, that was all in the same--

00:35:10.520 --> 00:35:11.360
 - That was all so close.

00:35:11.360 --> 00:35:13.160
 - She keeps saying, "I want a second opinion."

00:35:13.160 --> 00:35:15.120
 "I want a third opinion."

00:35:15.120 --> 00:35:16.680
 - But restaurants seemed to be much more willing.

00:35:16.680 --> 00:35:19.080
 The Oxo Tower Brasserie, which is a restaurant in London,

00:35:19.080 --> 00:35:21.680
 said, "Yes, of course, please leave the baby with us."

00:35:21.680 --> 00:35:23.040
 - I guess restaurants are smaller,

00:35:23.040 --> 00:35:25.400
 so you can go to the parent if there's an issue,

00:35:25.400 --> 00:35:26.600
 whereas National Gallery feel like

00:35:26.600 --> 00:35:27.960
 you can lose the parent, right?

00:35:27.960 --> 00:35:29.360
 - That's true, yeah.

00:35:29.360 --> 00:35:31.440
 - One famous person left in the cloakroom

00:35:31.440 --> 00:35:34.440
 is a character from Importance of Being Earnest,

00:35:34.440 --> 00:35:37.640
 left in a handbag in the station.

00:35:37.640 --> 00:35:41.440
 So I thought I'd look into that play by Oscar Wilde.

00:35:41.440 --> 00:35:44.800
 Yeah, so Oscar Wilde famously,

00:35:44.800 --> 00:35:48.680
 could you tell I can't find anything else about cloakrooms?

00:35:48.680 --> 00:35:53.320
 So he was famously brought up with charges of immorality,

00:35:53.320 --> 00:35:55.520
 wasn't he, because he was homosexual.

00:35:55.520 --> 00:35:57.480
 And in 1952, there was a movie,

00:35:57.480 --> 00:35:59.720
 the first movie made of the Importance of Being Earnest,

00:35:59.720 --> 00:36:03.200
 and it was directed by a guy called Anthony Asquith.

00:36:03.200 --> 00:36:06.680
 And Anthony Asquith was the son of Herbert Henry Asquith,

00:36:06.680 --> 00:36:08.360
 who was home secretary,

00:36:08.360 --> 00:36:11.120
 and he was the one who brought the charges of immorality

00:36:11.120 --> 00:36:12.320
 against Oscar Wilde,

00:36:12.320 --> 00:36:14.360
 which got him imprisoned in Reading jail.

00:36:14.360 --> 00:36:15.200
 - That's interesting.

00:36:15.200 --> 00:36:17.960
 - Yeah, and so he was the one who got him imprisoned,

00:36:17.960 --> 00:36:20.600
 and then his son was the director of the movie.

00:36:20.600 --> 00:36:21.440
 - That's really good.

00:36:21.440 --> 00:36:22.600
 - You look great full circle.

00:36:22.600 --> 00:36:25.040
 - I found some famous people who worked in cloakrooms.

00:36:25.040 --> 00:36:25.860
 - Oh yeah, cool.

00:36:25.860 --> 00:36:27.200
 - Mark Ormond.

00:36:27.200 --> 00:36:28.960
 - Oh, from Soft Cell.

00:36:28.960 --> 00:36:29.800
 - Soft Cell.

00:36:29.800 --> 00:36:31.000
 - Of Tainted Love fame.

00:36:31.000 --> 00:36:32.880
 - Can I just ask, is that the most famous,

00:36:32.880 --> 00:36:33.920
 and you're going to less and less?

00:36:33.920 --> 00:36:34.840
 'Cause I haven't heard of him,

00:36:34.840 --> 00:36:36.280
 I'm gonna scratch off the dress.

00:36:36.280 --> 00:36:37.360
 - Don't worry, I actually,

00:36:37.360 --> 00:36:39.160
 I started with my weakest one.

00:36:39.160 --> 00:36:40.000
 - Okay, great.

00:36:40.000 --> 00:36:40.880
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:36:40.880 --> 00:36:42.160
 Where did he work in the cloakroom?

00:36:42.160 --> 00:36:43.000
 Sorry, did you solve?

00:36:43.000 --> 00:36:45.840
 - Probably at the front bit, where you take his clothes.

00:36:45.840 --> 00:36:47.320
 - So he was high up in the role.

00:36:47.320 --> 00:36:49.440
 - I didn't write it down, I'm sorry.

00:36:49.440 --> 00:36:50.560
 - Silla Black.

00:36:50.560 --> 00:36:51.400
 - Yeah.

00:36:51.400 --> 00:36:53.240
 - The cloakroom attendant at the cavern club.

00:36:53.240 --> 00:36:54.320
 - Who else is on your list?

00:36:54.320 --> 00:36:55.160
 - Boy George.

00:36:55.160 --> 00:36:56.720
 - Boy George, yeah.

00:36:56.720 --> 00:36:57.560
 - He, um.

00:36:57.560 --> 00:36:58.880
 - At the culture club, wasn't it?

00:36:58.880 --> 00:36:59.720
 (laughing)

00:36:59.720 --> 00:37:01.040
 - Good, sorry.

00:37:01.040 --> 00:37:02.760
 That's the band that Boy George was in.

00:37:02.760 --> 00:37:04.240
 - Thank you, didn't get it yet.

00:37:04.240 --> 00:37:06.480
 - Yeah, and Boy George is a singer in the band.

00:37:06.480 --> 00:37:07.320
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:37:07.320 --> 00:37:09.000
 - Cool, I don't want to ruin every joke by asking,

00:37:09.000 --> 00:37:10.840
 so sometimes I'll just stay quiet and let it happen.

00:37:10.840 --> 00:37:12.600
 - Karma Chameleon was the big hit.

00:37:12.600 --> 00:37:14.360
 - That didn't help the joke.

00:37:14.360 --> 00:37:16.680
 - No, just I'm just helping Anna understand who this is.

00:37:16.680 --> 00:37:17.520
 - Good to learn.

00:37:17.520 --> 00:37:18.360
 - He was interviewed about it later,

00:37:18.360 --> 00:37:20.240
 and he said, "I was always rippling through pockets

00:37:20.240 --> 00:37:23.000
 "and handbags, most people were too pissed to notice."

00:37:23.000 --> 00:37:24.000
 - Oh, yeah.

00:37:24.000 --> 00:37:25.680
 - Any babies in the handbags?

00:37:25.680 --> 00:37:27.680
 - He didn't find the people.

00:37:27.680 --> 00:37:28.680
 - Riffling, hey?

00:37:28.680 --> 00:37:29.760
 - In my notes, I've got riffing,

00:37:29.760 --> 00:37:31.200
 but that can't possibly be true.

00:37:31.200 --> 00:37:33.440
 - No, I just would always say rifling.

00:37:33.440 --> 00:37:35.640
 - That's better, then that is correct, yep.

00:37:35.640 --> 00:37:37.560
 Sorry, yeah.

00:37:37.560 --> 00:37:38.840
 - On cloakrooms.

00:37:38.840 --> 00:37:40.160
 - Oh, yeah.

00:37:40.160 --> 00:37:42.560
 - I read, so I think we've talked before about

00:37:42.560 --> 00:37:46.240
 how popcorn wasn't really loud in cinemas until the third,

00:37:46.240 --> 00:37:48.120
 and it was sort of post-depression, I think,

00:37:48.120 --> 00:37:49.760
 when everyone was so depressed.

00:37:49.760 --> 00:37:51.600
 They were like, "Let us have the popcorn."

00:37:51.600 --> 00:37:54.040
 And also, yeah, the cinemas filled that.

00:37:54.040 --> 00:37:55.320
 - They thought people would tread it

00:37:55.320 --> 00:37:57.000
 into the nice carpets, didn't they?

00:37:57.000 --> 00:37:58.400
 - Well, before that, exactly.

00:37:58.400 --> 00:37:59.720
 They thought people would tread it into the carpets.

00:37:59.720 --> 00:38:00.560
 It was too noisy,

00:38:00.560 --> 00:38:02.680
 and so you used to have to leave your popcorn in the cloakroom

00:38:02.680 --> 00:38:06.400
 'cause people set up popcorn stands all outside cinemas,

00:38:06.400 --> 00:38:07.960
 and they sell it to you, leaving the cloakroom.

00:38:07.960 --> 00:38:10.080
 - That's amazing, just hand it in like a gun or something,

00:38:10.080 --> 00:38:12.040
 and then you get it back afterwards.

00:38:12.040 --> 00:38:14.200
 - You take a gun to the cinema?

00:38:14.200 --> 00:38:16.280
 - No, sorry, I'm thinking of the thing in Old West.

00:38:16.280 --> 00:38:17.760
 - Every time someone looks at their phone

00:38:17.760 --> 00:38:18.760
 in the middle of a movie.

00:38:18.760 --> 00:38:21.000
 (laughing)

00:38:21.000 --> 00:38:23.280
 - You got in a lot of trouble in your tour

00:38:23.280 --> 00:38:25.920
 of some national gallery clothes, didn't you?

00:38:25.920 --> 00:38:27.720
 Keep my AK-47.

00:38:27.720 --> 00:38:29.280
 - Wasn't there a thing where you had to hand in your gun

00:38:29.280 --> 00:38:31.480
 when you went to a Wild West bar?

00:38:31.480 --> 00:38:33.840
 - Towns, like most of the Wild West towns

00:38:33.840 --> 00:38:35.560
 wouldn't allow guns inside,

00:38:35.560 --> 00:38:37.880
 so they would have a way to sort of stop, you know?

00:38:37.880 --> 00:38:38.720
 - I think that's where--

00:38:38.720 --> 00:38:40.360
 - Often you had them taken at the periphery

00:38:40.360 --> 00:38:41.560
 of what we've talked about.

00:38:41.560 --> 00:38:44.320
 - In fact, I think we said that in the OK Corral,

00:38:44.320 --> 00:38:45.680
 problem was the reason it happened

00:38:45.680 --> 00:38:46.960
 is 'cause they hadn't put their guns

00:38:46.960 --> 00:38:48.480
 in the cloakroom before they arrived.

00:38:48.480 --> 00:38:50.840
 - Exactly, that's what I'm thinking of.

00:38:50.840 --> 00:38:52.720
 That's my incredibly convoluted part of that, you know?

00:38:52.720 --> 00:38:54.840
 - Actually, speaking of weapons in cloakrooms,

00:38:54.840 --> 00:38:57.520
 tell me something famous about the Houses of Parliament.

00:38:57.520 --> 00:38:59.120
 - Oh yeah, the swords in the cloakroom.

00:38:59.120 --> 00:39:01.280
 You've got a place for your swords.

00:39:01.280 --> 00:39:03.360
 - There are hooks in the cloakroom

00:39:03.360 --> 00:39:05.520
 so you can hang up your sword.

00:39:05.520 --> 00:39:07.000
 - Yep, absolutely.

00:39:07.000 --> 00:39:09.240
 If you go into the Houses of Parliament cloakrooms,

00:39:09.240 --> 00:39:12.560
 all the coat hangers have a loop of pink ribbon around them,

00:39:12.560 --> 00:39:15.320
 and that is for holding your sword.

00:39:15.320 --> 00:39:17.760
 So you're not allowed to sword in the chamber.

00:39:17.760 --> 00:39:22.400
 And I read a good expose of the fact that this,

00:39:22.400 --> 00:39:23.640
 there's no evidence, this is true.

00:39:23.640 --> 00:39:25.440
 So various reasons.

00:39:25.440 --> 00:39:28.560
 So in the massive fire in the 1830s,

00:39:28.560 --> 00:39:29.640
 when everything was destroyed,

00:39:29.640 --> 00:39:32.160
 that was way after anyone would ever bring swords in.

00:39:32.160 --> 00:39:35.040
 And so it's weird that they would have the sword hooks.

00:39:35.040 --> 00:39:36.560
 But even if they were for swords,

00:39:36.560 --> 00:39:38.840
 the first mention that they were was 1928,

00:39:38.840 --> 00:39:40.000
 and it was like an MP saying,

00:39:40.000 --> 00:39:41.080
 "Hey, they've got ribbons there."

00:39:41.080 --> 00:39:43.720
 And that's from the olden days 'cause of the sword thing.

00:39:43.720 --> 00:39:45.680
 And actually, all the mentions before that

00:39:45.680 --> 00:39:48.440
 say they were for a much more sensible item.

00:39:48.440 --> 00:39:49.280
 - Umbrella's.

00:39:49.280 --> 00:39:51.280
 - Umbrella's.

00:39:51.280 --> 00:39:52.240
 There you go.

00:39:52.240 --> 00:39:55.360
 - I've got a bit of Australian cinema news

00:39:55.360 --> 00:39:58.520
 just while we were talking about Aussie cinemas.

00:39:58.520 --> 00:40:01.280
 Australia's longest running pornographic cinema

00:40:01.280 --> 00:40:03.920
 is finally going to shut down.

00:40:03.920 --> 00:40:04.880
 And according to the article,

00:40:04.880 --> 00:40:06.480
 it's called the Crazy Horse Cinema.

00:40:06.480 --> 00:40:07.880
 And according to the article,

00:40:07.880 --> 00:40:09.720
 dozens of 90 year old pensioners

00:40:09.720 --> 00:40:11.800
 are gonna be absolutely distraught

00:40:11.800 --> 00:40:13.480
 'cause it's their meeting place.

00:40:13.480 --> 00:40:16.480
 - There's a big group of 90.

00:40:16.480 --> 00:40:18.200
 - What did she say?

00:40:18.200 --> 00:40:20.000
 What's she doing?

00:40:20.000 --> 00:40:21.360
 She's gonna get a cold.

00:40:21.360 --> 00:40:24.360
 He's not a real plumber.

00:40:24.360 --> 00:40:26.600
 Sorry, what?

00:40:26.600 --> 00:40:29.600
 - Yeah, this place has been open for many years.

00:40:29.600 --> 00:40:32.440
 And supposedly it's a really good meeting ground

00:40:32.440 --> 00:40:34.440
 for a lot of these 90 year old pensioners.

00:40:34.440 --> 00:40:36.560
 So they all meet up there at 10 a.m.

00:40:36.560 --> 00:40:39.720
 - Very early to start.

00:40:39.720 --> 00:40:41.560
 - Very early.

00:40:41.560 --> 00:40:43.000
 This comes from a quote from the lady.

00:40:43.000 --> 00:40:45.320
 They come and they do their thing in the morning.

00:40:45.320 --> 00:40:46.160
 - Disgusting.

00:40:46.160 --> 00:40:48.120
 (laughing)

00:40:48.120 --> 00:40:51.520
 They come and then they have their meeting.

00:40:51.520 --> 00:40:53.280
 - Yeah, they could come and do their thing in the morning,

00:40:53.280 --> 00:40:54.400
 whatever that is they do.

00:40:54.400 --> 00:40:56.800
 And then they go and maybe do some shopping for the wife

00:40:56.800 --> 00:40:57.640
 and maybe have some lunch

00:40:57.640 --> 00:40:58.720
 and then come back if they like.

00:40:58.720 --> 00:40:59.560
 What they get is--

00:40:59.560 --> 00:41:00.400
 - Oh, they sell mail pensioners.

00:41:00.400 --> 00:41:01.240
 - It's mail pensioners

00:41:01.240 --> 00:41:04.200
 and they get a $10 pensioner all day ticket

00:41:04.200 --> 00:41:06.200
 to the porno cinema.

00:41:06.200 --> 00:41:07.040
 - What?

00:41:07.040 --> 00:41:08.200
 So sorry, when they're having this meeting,

00:41:08.200 --> 00:41:09.040
 is it in the cinema?

00:41:09.040 --> 00:41:10.680
 Why won't you film? - It's not really a meeting, is it?

00:41:10.680 --> 00:41:12.080
 It's sort of like a gathering.

00:41:12.080 --> 00:41:13.960
 - I even think as a teenager,

00:41:13.960 --> 00:41:15.400
 I would be able to get my money's worth

00:41:15.400 --> 00:41:18.280
 from an old day ticket on a graphic cinema.

00:41:18.280 --> 00:41:19.120
 (laughing)

00:41:19.120 --> 00:41:19.960
 It's a pensioner.

00:41:19.960 --> 00:41:21.800
 - For angry sales in Australia.

00:41:21.800 --> 00:41:24.040
 (laughing)

00:41:24.040 --> 00:41:24.880
 - That's so funny.

00:41:24.880 --> 00:41:26.920
 - Yeah, so these guys, these nine-year-olds

00:41:26.920 --> 00:41:27.840
 have been going for 20 years.

00:41:27.840 --> 00:41:31.400
 So, you know, they were a fruity, fresh 70-year-olds

00:41:31.400 --> 00:41:32.240
 at the time.

00:41:32.240 --> 00:41:35.400
 And yeah, and then obviously--

00:41:35.400 --> 00:41:36.400
 - These lads are gonna be thrilled

00:41:36.400 --> 00:41:38.320
 when they find out about the internet.

00:41:38.320 --> 00:41:40.560
 (laughing)

00:41:41.400 --> 00:41:44.360
 - Yeah, that's, you know, so they're distraught

00:41:44.360 --> 00:41:45.200
 at the moment.

00:41:45.200 --> 00:41:46.040
 And it's closing this year.

00:41:46.040 --> 00:41:47.760
 This is from this year, this article.

00:41:47.760 --> 00:41:50.400
 - Good, but crazy, the crazy boys.

00:41:50.400 --> 00:41:53.200
 - Knock it down, so the ground with salt.

00:41:53.200 --> 00:41:54.040
 - I don't know.

00:41:54.040 --> 00:41:55.040
 It keeps them out for the full day,

00:41:55.040 --> 00:41:56.680
 which is judging by the sounds of these men.

00:41:56.680 --> 00:41:57.520
 Sounds like some of the boys.

00:41:57.520 --> 00:41:58.360
 - That's the poor idea, yeah.

00:41:58.360 --> 00:41:59.200
 - Yeah.

00:41:59.200 --> 00:42:00.040
 - Is popcorn allowed?

00:42:00.040 --> 00:42:01.120
 - Um, as a matter of the cup,

00:42:01.120 --> 00:42:02.960
 it's got bigger concerns, actually.

00:42:02.960 --> 00:42:03.800
 (laughing)

00:42:03.800 --> 00:42:06.380
 (upbeat music)

00:42:09.040 --> 00:42:12.040
 - Okay, it is time for our final fact of the show,

00:42:12.040 --> 00:42:14.000
 and that is Anna.

00:42:14.000 --> 00:42:17.280
 - My fact this week is that the original vapes

00:42:17.280 --> 00:42:19.000
 were Pez dispensers.

00:42:19.000 --> 00:42:21.280
 (laughing)

00:42:21.280 --> 00:42:24.580
 So, you know, for people in the UK who maybe don't,

00:42:24.580 --> 00:42:27.240
 Pez dispensers are like those sweet holders.

00:42:27.240 --> 00:42:29.240
 They're a huge deal in America, right?

00:42:29.240 --> 00:42:31.680
 They're kind of tubes that hold sweets,

00:42:31.680 --> 00:42:32.640
 and they have a funny head on top.

00:42:32.640 --> 00:42:33.880
 - Well, yeah, so you got a little funny head,

00:42:33.880 --> 00:42:35.600
 and you tip the head back,

00:42:35.600 --> 00:42:39.520
 and it's like an elevator system where the latest sweet

00:42:39.520 --> 00:42:41.360
 that's sitting on top arrives at the top,

00:42:41.360 --> 00:42:43.040
 bing, and you get to pull it out,

00:42:43.040 --> 00:42:46.320
 and it's a little rectangular sweetie.

00:42:46.320 --> 00:42:47.880
 - Like a brick, but much smaller.

00:42:47.880 --> 00:42:49.680
 - Exactly, like a tiny brick built.

00:42:49.680 --> 00:42:51.260
 - Yeah, if you were building a house for an else.

00:42:51.260 --> 00:42:53.200
 - Imagine if you were building a house,

00:42:53.200 --> 00:42:54.240
 but you had an elevator,

00:42:54.240 --> 00:42:56.160
 and every time you needed to put a brick on,

00:42:56.160 --> 00:42:58.160
 the brick had to come up in an elevator.

00:42:58.160 --> 00:42:59.000
 - Yeah.

00:42:59.000 --> 00:42:59.840
 - And then it would come out.

00:42:59.840 --> 00:43:01.480
 - Well, this is a classically helpful,

00:43:01.480 --> 00:43:03.440
 no such thing as a fishing explainer.

00:43:03.440 --> 00:43:04.280
 - The lucky thing is,

00:43:04.280 --> 00:43:06.040
 everyone knows one of Pez,

00:43:06.040 --> 00:43:07.360
 (all laughing)

00:43:07.360 --> 00:43:08.920
 - That was a waste of your time in ours.

00:43:08.920 --> 00:43:11.540
 - Yeah, it's, yeah, and you,

00:43:11.540 --> 00:43:13.200
 - Are you gonna, so you're gonna try as well now?

00:43:13.200 --> 00:43:16.080
 - I think of them as kind of confectionary staplers,

00:43:16.080 --> 00:43:18.120
 'cause you have to load it in cartilage with sweets,

00:43:18.120 --> 00:43:19.880
 don't you, and you like some staples.

00:43:19.880 --> 00:43:22.080
 - That's actually the best simile that we've had so far.

00:43:22.080 --> 00:43:23.200
 - That was actually really good, yeah.

00:43:23.200 --> 00:43:24.040
 - We'll allow it.

00:43:24.040 --> 00:43:28.680
 Anyway, Pez sweets were created in 1927 in Vienna.

00:43:28.680 --> 00:43:30.000
 - And people smoke them.

00:43:30.000 --> 00:43:33.040
 - And people load them into their cigarettes.

00:43:33.040 --> 00:43:34.080
 No, but they were created

00:43:34.080 --> 00:43:36.320
 by a guy called Edward Haas III,

00:43:36.320 --> 00:43:38.400
 and he was an anti-smoking campaigner,

00:43:38.400 --> 00:43:39.680
 thought it was bad for your health,

00:43:39.680 --> 00:43:41.360
 well done, very forward-thinking of him,

00:43:41.360 --> 00:43:43.200
 and he wanted to create a tablet

00:43:43.200 --> 00:43:47.000
 that helped people to cut down on smoking or overeating.

00:43:47.000 --> 00:43:49.800
 And so they were these mint tablets,

00:43:49.800 --> 00:43:51.720
 and that was what they were explicitly for.

00:43:51.720 --> 00:43:55.400
 Early advert said, "No smoking, pezzing allowed."

00:43:55.400 --> 00:43:56.520
 Like vaping.

00:43:56.520 --> 00:43:59.360
 And then when the dispensers came about in the '50s,

00:43:59.360 --> 00:44:01.440
 they are sort of, well, the first ones were shaped

00:44:01.440 --> 00:44:03.400
 so like really like cigarette lighters,

00:44:03.400 --> 00:44:07.120
 and they were for adults, marketed very much for adults.

00:44:07.120 --> 00:44:09.640
 - And they used to send women in sort of like

00:44:09.640 --> 00:44:13.680
 quite cleavage-heavy dresses around in vans.

00:44:13.680 --> 00:44:14.520
 - Cleavage-heavy.

00:44:14.520 --> 00:44:15.680
 - Low putts, we call them.

00:44:15.680 --> 00:44:17.880
 - Yeah, cleavage-heavy, not all right.

00:44:17.880 --> 00:44:19.840
 I guess we're wearing a very cleavage-heavy top tonight.

00:44:19.840 --> 00:44:21.680
 It's a cut.

00:44:21.680 --> 00:44:24.760
 Your saucy fashion show, the descriptions are not good.

00:44:24.760 --> 00:44:28.320
 - They said they do look a bit like lighters,

00:44:28.320 --> 00:44:30.040
 but according to Sean Peterson,

00:44:30.040 --> 00:44:33.360
 who's the historian at Pez Candy, incorporated,

00:44:33.360 --> 00:44:36.200
 they were only designed that way to fit into pockets.

00:44:36.200 --> 00:44:38.400
 It's just a coincidence that they look like lighters

00:44:38.400 --> 00:44:40.880
 'cause lighters are also designed to go into pockets.

00:44:40.880 --> 00:44:43.840
 - Yeah, I did hear that Pez Candy,

00:44:43.840 --> 00:44:46.040
 incorporated does have an official historian, I thought.

00:44:46.040 --> 00:44:46.960
 - Sean Peterson.

00:44:46.960 --> 00:44:50.040
 - It's a very light historian gig,

00:44:50.040 --> 00:44:52.360
 as in it's a very, very small area of history.

00:44:52.360 --> 00:44:54.280
 - I reckon he does other stuff.

00:44:54.280 --> 00:44:55.120
 - You'd have to.

00:44:55.120 --> 00:44:57.760
 - I think usually the historians in these kind of companies

00:44:57.760 --> 00:44:59.440
 are actually someone who does another job,

00:44:59.440 --> 00:45:01.400
 but in their spare time, they kind of--

00:45:01.400 --> 00:45:02.240
 - I'm sure you're right,

00:45:02.240 --> 00:45:03.680
 because otherwise you'd feel like a fool

00:45:03.680 --> 00:45:05.200
 turning up at a historian's conference.

00:45:05.200 --> 00:45:06.080
 They'd be like, "What do you study?"

00:45:06.080 --> 00:45:08.120
 "Oh, the 19th century mostly, what about you?"

00:45:08.120 --> 00:45:09.840
 (laughing)

00:45:09.840 --> 00:45:11.880
 - You sat next to Mary Beard on one side

00:45:11.880 --> 00:45:13.440
 and Dan Snow on the other side.

00:45:13.440 --> 00:45:16.080
 (laughing)

00:45:16.080 --> 00:45:18.240
 - But yeah, it was until they came to America

00:45:18.240 --> 00:45:20.720
 that they still, even when the dispensers were added,

00:45:20.720 --> 00:45:22.440
 this was a way to give up smoking.

00:45:22.440 --> 00:45:24.480
 And apparently it was only when they went to America

00:45:24.480 --> 00:45:26.520
 in the '50s and tried to market them there

00:45:26.520 --> 00:45:27.760
 and they were targeting adults,

00:45:27.760 --> 00:45:29.240
 kids how to quit smoking.

00:45:29.240 --> 00:45:31.200
 America didn't have the same appetite to quit smoking.

00:45:31.200 --> 00:45:32.960
 I think maybe there wasn't such a campaign back then

00:45:32.960 --> 00:45:35.640
 as there was in Austria, saying this is bad.

00:45:35.640 --> 00:45:38.160
 And so they thought, let's start putting fun,

00:45:38.160 --> 00:45:39.400
 turning them into fun kid shapes

00:45:39.400 --> 00:45:40.480
 and marketing them to children.

00:45:40.480 --> 00:45:42.240
 - Yeah, and changing the taste, obviously,

00:45:42.240 --> 00:45:45.600
 of the thing from a sort of anti-smoking nicotine--

00:45:45.600 --> 00:45:47.280
 - Well, they wasn't just peppermint.

00:45:47.280 --> 00:45:49.800
 - No, no, but as in they changed it to sweeties.

00:45:49.800 --> 00:45:50.640
 They made this.

00:45:50.640 --> 00:45:51.760
 - But they were always minty.

00:45:51.760 --> 00:45:53.040
 - They were always minty on the start.

00:45:53.040 --> 00:45:54.200
 - 'Cause that's where the name comes from.

00:45:54.200 --> 00:45:56.120
 It comes from the German for peppermint.

00:45:56.120 --> 00:45:56.960
 - Oh, yeah.

00:45:56.960 --> 00:46:00.360
 - Weirdly, one of the first flavors they had was chlorophyll.

00:46:00.360 --> 00:46:01.200
 - Yeah.

00:46:01.200 --> 00:46:02.040
 - What?

00:46:02.040 --> 00:46:02.880
 - So what is that?

00:46:02.880 --> 00:46:04.800
 - It's the green stuff you get in leaves.

00:46:04.800 --> 00:46:06.400
 - It's hard to know what it tastes like.

00:46:06.400 --> 00:46:07.240
 - Exactly.

00:46:07.240 --> 00:46:08.080
 - I've never thought of it as anything.

00:46:08.080 --> 00:46:09.200
 - It tastes like grass, I reckon.

00:46:09.200 --> 00:46:12.760
 - I would imagine so too, but it's such a weird flavor.

00:46:12.760 --> 00:46:15.560
 Can we talk about Edouard Haas, the third?

00:46:15.560 --> 00:46:16.400
 - Haas, yes.

00:46:16.400 --> 00:46:17.800
 - So it's a really interesting family,

00:46:17.800 --> 00:46:21.080
 because his father, Edward Haas the second,

00:46:21.080 --> 00:46:23.160
 was a baked goods merchant.

00:46:23.160 --> 00:46:24.720
 Okay, so it's all baking powder.

00:46:24.720 --> 00:46:27.000
 And his father, Edward Haas--

00:46:27.000 --> 00:46:28.560
 - It's not actually a baked good, is it?

00:46:28.560 --> 00:46:30.360
 - It's a good for baking.

00:46:30.360 --> 00:46:31.880
 - What a good point, it's a baking goods.

00:46:31.880 --> 00:46:33.200
 Yeah, yeah, sorry, I stand corrected.

00:46:33.200 --> 00:46:38.200
 Okay, but basically, Edward the third

00:46:38.200 --> 00:46:41.040
 seems to have invented the first ready-made cake mixture.

00:46:41.040 --> 00:46:41.880
 It's a huge deal.

00:46:41.880 --> 00:46:44.440
 - So wait a minute, was this the one who did Paz,

00:46:44.440 --> 00:46:45.280
 or is this--

00:46:45.280 --> 00:46:46.600
 - The one who did Paz, the third, yeah.

00:46:46.600 --> 00:46:48.280
 Edward the third is the guy who did Hassan

00:46:48.280 --> 00:46:50.720
 for the baking of health sponge cakes.

00:46:50.720 --> 00:46:55.160
 Edward's grandfather, Edward Haas the first, okay.

00:46:55.160 --> 00:46:56.960
 I've read one reference to this.

00:46:56.960 --> 00:46:58.720
 "I cannot find any more detail anywhere,

00:46:58.720 --> 00:47:01.160
 "but there's a source online which claims that he died

00:47:01.160 --> 00:47:04.400
 "as a result of medical experiments he did on himself."

00:47:04.400 --> 00:47:07.320
 There's no further evidence that I found.

00:47:07.320 --> 00:47:10.720
 So if you know, please write in and enlighten us,

00:47:10.720 --> 00:47:15.120
 because it's not clear what he was doing to himself.

00:47:15.120 --> 00:47:17.040
 - They're in the baking industry, what could he have done?

00:47:17.040 --> 00:47:20.120
 He added too much bicarbonate soda to himself.

00:47:20.120 --> 00:47:21.680
 - He wanted to know how hot to bake things,

00:47:21.680 --> 00:47:23.200
 so he tested the temperature himself.

00:47:23.200 --> 00:47:24.040
 - Sat in the oven.

00:47:24.040 --> 00:47:25.720
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:47:25.720 --> 00:47:26.840
 I mean, he cut a hole in his neck

00:47:26.840 --> 00:47:28.360
 so he could dispense loads of bread

00:47:28.360 --> 00:47:29.520
 when he took his head back.

00:47:29.520 --> 00:47:30.760
 (laughing)

00:47:30.760 --> 00:47:32.840
 - It's so unclear what he did.

00:47:32.840 --> 00:47:35.200
 There's no further detail, so mystery.

00:47:35.200 --> 00:47:38.520
 - So the evolution of the Paz dispenser itself

00:47:38.520 --> 00:47:40.760
 is very exciting, you know.

00:47:40.760 --> 00:47:44.520
 Poor Haas the third didn't get to see the feet

00:47:44.520 --> 00:47:46.960
 that were added to the bottom of a Paz dispenser

00:47:46.960 --> 00:47:48.560
 to allow it to stand.

00:47:48.560 --> 00:47:49.600
 That was a big innovation.

00:47:49.600 --> 00:47:51.880
 It's the Paz we know and love.

00:47:51.880 --> 00:47:53.680
 - That was 1987, I believe, wasn't it?

00:47:53.680 --> 00:47:54.600
 - That was in '87.

00:47:54.600 --> 00:47:56.120
 - And they had weird designs before it.

00:47:56.120 --> 00:47:59.160
 So before they added the feet, there was one in 1956,

00:47:59.160 --> 00:48:02.160
 they invented a sort of space gun.

00:48:02.160 --> 00:48:04.760
 And also, from what I've seen, regular looking guns.

00:48:04.760 --> 00:48:07.880
 So the idea is that the gun would shoot out.

00:48:07.880 --> 00:48:10.680
 It's like a pistol would shoot out the Paz at the end

00:48:10.680 --> 00:48:11.760
 into your mouth.

00:48:11.760 --> 00:48:14.800
 - Of course, you have to put the gun in your mouth.

00:48:14.800 --> 00:48:17.080
 - It doesn't seem like.

00:48:17.080 --> 00:48:19.000
 - The guy who set up the Paz dispenser,

00:48:19.000 --> 00:48:20.680
 as we know it, is a guy, well,

00:48:20.680 --> 00:48:22.280
 the guy who was in charge of the decision, basically,

00:48:22.280 --> 00:48:24.400
 was a man called Curtis Alina,

00:48:24.400 --> 00:48:27.600
 who was a European.

00:48:27.600 --> 00:48:30.160
 He was born in Prague in 1922.

00:48:30.160 --> 00:48:33.400
 He was Jewish and that was not a good time

00:48:33.400 --> 00:48:35.880
 to be born Jewish in Central Europe in Prague.

00:48:35.880 --> 00:48:38.080
 His family were all sent to concentration camps.

00:48:38.080 --> 00:48:40.040
 He was the only surviving member of his family

00:48:40.040 --> 00:48:41.800
 in Europe after the war.

00:48:41.800 --> 00:48:46.800
 He went to the USA and he started working for Paz.

00:48:46.800 --> 00:48:49.640
 But the US and the European Paz

00:48:49.640 --> 00:48:51.120
 were kind of two different camps.

00:48:51.120 --> 00:48:53.800
 They were quite remote from each other.

00:48:53.800 --> 00:48:55.040
 They weren't really tied together

00:48:55.040 --> 00:48:57.160
 and he had to persuade the Viennese outfit.

00:48:57.160 --> 00:48:59.200
 They wanted serious sober grown-up mints,

00:48:59.200 --> 00:49:00.960
 you know, adult mints,

00:49:00.960 --> 00:49:03.360
 that this dispenser thing was a good idea.

00:49:03.360 --> 00:49:04.520
 But I just, I mention all of this

00:49:04.520 --> 00:49:06.680
 because there's a weird link to Sigmund Freud,

00:49:06.680 --> 00:49:08.440
 who was from Vienna.

00:49:08.440 --> 00:49:11.600
 - Okay, I'm gonna copy the old James Harkinville circle here.

00:49:11.600 --> 00:49:14.400
 - But the link is not just that they're both in Vienna.

00:49:14.400 --> 00:49:16.200
 - Well, he lived across the street from Sigmund Freud

00:49:16.200 --> 00:49:18.160
 when he was a boy, supposedly.

00:49:18.160 --> 00:49:19.600
 And there was this brilliant website I found

00:49:19.600 --> 00:49:21.400
 which is called Freud's Butcher.com,

00:49:21.400 --> 00:49:23.360
 which is about the history of Sigmund Freud

00:49:23.360 --> 00:49:24.920
 by an author called E.D. Jarrellim.

00:49:24.920 --> 00:49:25.760
 She's great.

00:49:25.760 --> 00:49:28.880
 It's a blog about genealogy, psychology and meat, okay?

00:49:28.880 --> 00:49:32.920
 And there's a theory that she posits

00:49:32.920 --> 00:49:37.200
 that Edward Haas III might have been considering

00:49:37.200 --> 00:49:39.720
 Freud's theory of oral fixation

00:49:39.720 --> 00:49:40.960
 when he came up with the idea

00:49:40.960 --> 00:49:43.240
 of substituting peppermint sweets for cigarettes.

00:49:43.240 --> 00:49:44.080
 - Oh, I see.

00:49:44.080 --> 00:49:47.120
 Not that the Paz dispenser looks a bit like a penis.

00:49:47.120 --> 00:49:48.840
 - No, that's not.

00:49:48.840 --> 00:49:51.880
 Although that's an excellent evolution of the theory.

00:49:51.880 --> 00:49:54.160
 Maybe he was only thinking about it subconsciously,

00:49:54.160 --> 00:49:58.160
 but wouldn't that be appropriate given that it's Freud?

00:49:58.160 --> 00:49:59.000
 - Yeah?

00:49:59.000 --> 00:50:01.640
 - What a load of absolute balls.

00:50:01.640 --> 00:50:03.520
 Oh, he happened to live in opposite Freud.

00:50:03.520 --> 00:50:07.200
 What weird convoluted thing can we attribute to that?

00:50:07.200 --> 00:50:08.040
 - Are you right?

00:50:08.040 --> 00:50:10.320
 She says it's a huge stretch.

00:50:10.320 --> 00:50:11.360
 - She says that as well.

00:50:11.360 --> 00:50:12.200
 - She also says that.

00:50:12.200 --> 00:50:13.480
 - Okay, I disagree.

00:50:13.480 --> 00:50:17.120
 - So have you guys come across Steve Gloo?

00:50:17.120 --> 00:50:18.240
 - Oh, no.

00:50:18.240 --> 00:50:19.400
 - The Paz Outlaw.

00:50:19.400 --> 00:50:21.960
 - The Paz Outlaw, self-styled.

00:50:21.960 --> 00:50:24.600
 - I can't believe I genuinely got like a tingle of goosebumps.

00:50:24.600 --> 00:50:26.240
 You both got excited by that.

00:50:26.240 --> 00:50:27.480
 Who's Steve Gloo?

00:50:27.480 --> 00:50:31.280
 - He is basically the king of collecting pezzas.

00:50:31.280 --> 00:50:32.920
 So he would go to Europe

00:50:32.920 --> 00:50:36.120
 and he would get all of these really, really rare pezzas,

00:50:36.120 --> 00:50:37.920
 sometimes digging through garbage

00:50:37.920 --> 00:50:40.320
 to try and get ones which had been thrown out.

00:50:40.320 --> 00:50:42.000
 And then he would take them back to America

00:50:42.000 --> 00:50:45.400
 and he would sell them to Paz enthusiasts.

00:50:45.400 --> 00:50:48.920
 And he said at one stage he was making $4.5 million.

00:50:48.920 --> 00:50:52.760
 He made that much in total selling pez candy dispensers

00:50:52.760 --> 00:50:55.960
 that he'd taken from Eastern Europe and sold in America.

00:50:55.960 --> 00:50:57.840
 - And it seemed to be there was some kind of loophole

00:50:57.840 --> 00:50:59.840
 in terms of importing them or...

00:50:59.840 --> 00:51:02.080
 - Well, he just sort of snuck through customs

00:51:02.080 --> 00:51:03.120
 quite a lot with them.

00:51:03.120 --> 00:51:06.000
 And it was, honestly, so this is where I first...

00:51:06.000 --> 00:51:07.680
 - Where was he hiding them?

00:51:07.680 --> 00:51:10.320
 - I think often they didn't check.

00:51:10.320 --> 00:51:13.440
 - It's just the right shape.

00:51:13.440 --> 00:51:15.720
 That's why they're shaped like that.

00:51:15.720 --> 00:51:17.160
 - It wasn't one per trip.

00:51:17.160 --> 00:51:19.520
 - I don't think that would have been profitable.

00:51:19.520 --> 00:51:22.320
 - Just a little Mickey Mouse head sticking out his rectum.

00:51:22.320 --> 00:51:25.960
 - Help yourself to one more year down there.

00:51:25.960 --> 00:51:29.280
 - Yeah, this is how I came across this fact initially.

00:51:29.280 --> 00:51:31.480
 I was reading a review of "The Pez Outlaw"

00:51:31.480 --> 00:51:33.280
 which is coming out this year, I think.

00:51:33.280 --> 00:51:35.240
 And it's the film based on his adventures.

00:51:35.240 --> 00:51:37.720
 And it sounds proper exciting stuff.

00:51:37.720 --> 00:51:40.440
 It was him and his son who's an equally avid collector.

00:51:40.440 --> 00:51:42.120
 And he was real down and out.

00:51:42.120 --> 00:51:44.320
 Like wasn't making any money until he came across

00:51:44.320 --> 00:51:46.680
 this big scam where he'd fly to Eastern Europe,

00:51:46.680 --> 00:51:49.760
 go into factories and basically bribe factory workers

00:51:49.760 --> 00:51:51.200
 to give him a bunch of pez he knew

00:51:51.200 --> 00:51:52.960
 would be incredibly valuable.

00:51:52.960 --> 00:51:55.840
 But they drive around in this truck.

00:51:55.840 --> 00:51:58.840
 Apparently his son said he'd drive 24 hours straight.

00:51:58.840 --> 00:52:02.120
 He'd be so tired that he often crashed the truck

00:52:02.120 --> 00:52:04.480
 but just kept plugging away.

00:52:04.480 --> 00:52:09.000
 And he had this amazing rival called Patek

00:52:09.000 --> 00:52:14.000
 who was another Pez guy who also got first dibs

00:52:14.000 --> 00:52:16.320
 in the factories and flogged pez.

00:52:16.320 --> 00:52:19.440
 And apparently at one point glue pursued Patek

00:52:19.440 --> 00:52:21.600
 across Austria in a car chase.

00:52:21.600 --> 00:52:24.240
 And I said that they like drove on pavements.

00:52:24.240 --> 00:52:25.880
 They were on the wrong side of the road.

00:52:25.880 --> 00:52:28.080
 They had to bribe police with Pez dispensers

00:52:28.080 --> 00:52:29.500
 full of cash he played.

00:52:29.500 --> 00:52:31.480
 (laughing)

00:52:31.480 --> 00:52:34.680
 - It could only be tiny little son teams.

00:52:34.680 --> 00:52:36.080
 - They went with notes apparently.

00:52:36.080 --> 00:52:37.800
 I don't know how many notes you can fit in.

00:52:37.800 --> 00:52:39.600
 A couple of hundred dollar bills maybe.

00:52:39.600 --> 00:52:42.160
 - But then of course big Pez got involved, right?

00:52:42.160 --> 00:52:43.000
 - Big Pez?

00:52:43.000 --> 00:52:45.800
 - And so this guy decided he sort of

00:52:45.800 --> 00:52:47.840
 did a little bit of a deal with a guy in Hungary

00:52:47.840 --> 00:52:50.960
 and said that this guy would make extras for him.

00:52:50.960 --> 00:52:53.540
 And they would discontinued ones as well sometimes.

00:52:53.540 --> 00:52:56.260
 So they'd be really, really good expensive,

00:52:56.260 --> 00:52:57.720
 you know, rare Pezes.

00:52:57.720 --> 00:52:59.600
 This guy in Hungary would make them for him

00:52:59.600 --> 00:53:00.840
 and he would buy loads of them

00:53:00.840 --> 00:53:03.240
 and then take them back to America and sell them.

00:53:03.240 --> 00:53:05.920
 But one day he logged into the Pez website

00:53:05.920 --> 00:53:08.920
 and he found a new section called misfit dispensers.

00:53:08.920 --> 00:53:10.640
 And it was all the ones that he'd bought

00:53:10.640 --> 00:53:12.040
 from this guy in Hungary,

00:53:12.040 --> 00:53:15.000
 but Pez was selling them for like a dollar each.

00:53:15.000 --> 00:53:17.840
 And they basically just flooded the market

00:53:17.840 --> 00:53:19.680
 with other ones.

00:53:19.680 --> 00:53:24.680
 And he reckons that it left him $250,000 in debt.

00:53:24.680 --> 00:53:26.240
 This one trick.

00:53:26.240 --> 00:53:29.280
 And when he rang up this broker in Hungary and said,

00:53:29.280 --> 00:53:31.120
 "What's happened? Why are they doing this?"

00:53:31.120 --> 00:53:33.160
 The broker said, "The right hand knows

00:53:33.160 --> 00:53:35.300
 what the left is doing."

00:53:35.300 --> 00:53:37.360
 So basically it was all a scam.

00:53:37.360 --> 00:53:39.360
 They just basically fitted him up.

00:53:39.360 --> 00:53:41.120
 - That's extraordinary.

00:53:41.120 --> 00:53:43.880
 - So the dispenser was made by someone called Oscar.

00:53:44.100 --> 00:53:46.400
 (speaks in foreign language)

00:53:46.400 --> 00:53:50.240
 And his patent actually said that it would be helpful

00:53:50.240 --> 00:53:52.840
 for people who have only one hand.

00:53:52.840 --> 00:53:55.560
 So it was a way of dispensing sweets from a box,

00:53:55.560 --> 00:53:57.920
 but you only need one hand to do it.

00:53:57.920 --> 00:53:59.520
 And that's what it says in the patent.

00:53:59.520 --> 00:54:01.120
 It's useful for people with one hand.

00:54:01.120 --> 00:54:02.520
 - That's why it's so useful, actually,

00:54:02.520 --> 00:54:05.360
 for the pensioners at Dan's Blue Movie Cinema

00:54:05.360 --> 00:54:08.240
 who want to have a hand-free and enjoy a cinema snack.

00:54:08.240 --> 00:54:11.280
 - Dan's Blue Movie Cinema, as it is otherwise known.

00:54:11.280 --> 00:54:13.200
 - As it will be, 'cause they're selling it, aren't they?

00:54:13.200 --> 00:54:15.320
 - I have a balloon in my beard.

00:54:15.320 --> 00:54:17.160
 - Because in the patent it says it's important

00:54:17.160 --> 00:54:19.480
 not only for persons who have only one hand,

00:54:19.480 --> 00:54:22.240
 but also persons who often have only one hand free.

00:54:22.240 --> 00:54:24.120
 - Right. - There we go.

00:54:24.120 --> 00:54:26.240
 - His occupation causes their hands

00:54:26.240 --> 00:54:28.360
 to become smeared with dirt.

00:54:28.360 --> 00:54:30.480
 - Well, this is all brilliant news, Dan.

00:54:30.480 --> 00:54:31.760
 - Get in touch with your drums.

00:54:31.760 --> 00:54:33.440
 - Freud's penis dispenser in one hand

00:54:33.440 --> 00:54:35.340
 and your actual penis in the other.

00:54:35.340 --> 00:54:36.580
 (laughing)

00:54:36.580 --> 00:54:39.160
 (upbeat music)

00:54:39.160 --> 00:54:41.880
 - Okay, that's it.

00:54:41.880 --> 00:54:42.920
 - That is all of our facts.

00:54:42.920 --> 00:54:44.400
