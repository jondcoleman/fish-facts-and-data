00:00:00,00:00:02,(upbeat music)
00:00:02,00:00:17,"- Hello, and welcome to another episode"
00:00:17,00:00:20,"of No Such Thing as a Fish, a weekly podcast"
00:00:20,00:00:23,coming to you from the QI offices in Covent Garden.
00:00:23,00:00:24,My name is Dan Schreiber.
00:00:24,00:00:27,"I'm sitting here with Anna Tyshinski, Andrew Hunter Murray,"
00:00:27,00:00:29,"and James Harkin, and once again,"
00:00:29,00:00:31,we have gathered around the microphones
00:00:31,00:00:34,"with our four favorite facts from the last seven days,"
00:00:34,00:00:37,"and in no particular order, here we go."
00:00:37,00:00:41,"Starting with fact number one, and that is Andy."
00:00:41,00:00:43,- My fact is that one traditional Irish recipe
00:00:43,00:00:46,for Blemange involves moss.
00:00:46,00:00:47,- Here we go.
00:00:47,00:00:52,"- So, this is a cool fact about an old Irish pudding,"
00:00:52,00:00:53,and it's--
00:00:53,00:00:55,- That's what they say if you have to say it's cool.
00:00:55,00:00:56,"- Yeah, they have to tell the listener."
00:00:56,00:00:59,"- It's interesting, and it's cool."
00:00:59,00:01:01,"And it's actually from a hack-eye magazine,"
00:01:01,00:01:02,which I know you read--
00:01:02,00:01:03,"- That's Anna, isn't it?"
00:01:03,00:01:03,"- Yeah, yeah, yeah, sort of."
00:01:03,00:01:04,- You stole my 19.
00:01:04,00:01:05,"- I know, I'm on your turf already."
00:01:05,00:01:07,"But basically, there is this pudding,"
00:01:07,00:01:12,and it's made from a thing called dried carrageen.
00:01:12,00:01:14,"Okay, now, it's called moss, it's called Irish moss,"
00:01:14,00:01:17,"it's not actually moss, it's a kind of algae,"
00:01:17,00:01:19,and it's brown and crusty stuff
00:01:19,00:01:21,"when you take it out of the water, you dry out."
00:01:21,00:01:22,- Sounds delicious.
00:01:22,00:01:24,(laughing)
00:01:24,00:01:27,- You have to boil it in milk for 20 minutes.
00:01:27,00:01:28,- Okay.
00:01:28,00:01:29,"- And the thing is, when you boil it in milk,"
00:01:29,00:01:31,it vomits out this huge--
00:01:31,00:01:33,- Sounds absolutely delicious.
00:01:33,00:01:36,- You thought we were having your own cookery show.
00:01:36,00:01:37,You were next in my jello.
00:01:37,00:01:40,- It sort of vomits out this jelly stuff.
00:01:40,00:01:41,- Yeah.
00:01:41,00:01:43,- And you add the sugar and vanilla
00:01:43,00:01:45,"to make it slightly sweet, and you whisk it all up,"
00:01:45,00:01:46,and then you let it chill a bit.
00:01:46,00:01:50,"- I just love just going off the jello analogy,"
00:01:50,00:01:53,"the way that you really, when you said vomiting up,"
00:01:53,00:01:55,"you said it a few times, and you really stressed it."
00:01:55,00:01:56,And then when you got to the nice bit
00:01:56,00:01:58,"of adding some vanilla and sugar,"
00:01:58,00:01:59,"you were like, ""Oh yeah, we'll just gloss over that."""
00:01:59,00:02:00,That's fine.
00:02:00,00:02:03,"- Yeah, and then you've got your moss blommage."
00:02:03,00:02:06,"- And it apparently, it's quite crap, isn't it?"
00:02:06,00:02:08,"- Well, what's bad about it?"
00:02:08,00:02:09,"- I just think it's extremely bland,"
00:02:09,00:02:11,but I think it's good if you add a little bit.
00:02:11,00:02:13,"- It doesn't really taste of any,"
00:02:13,00:02:15,some people say it tastes of the sea.
00:02:15,00:02:16,- Yes.
00:02:16,00:02:18,"- But actually, I think it just tastes really bland."
00:02:18,00:02:20,"And they used to give it to sick people, didn't they?"
00:02:20,00:02:21,"If you were ill and infirm,"
00:02:21,00:02:23,you might get some of this pudding.
00:02:23,00:02:26,It's in a 19th century handbook of invalid cooking
00:02:26,00:02:29,"by Murray Boland, that's one of the early recipes."
00:02:29,00:02:30,"- Okay, right."
00:02:30,00:02:31,"- And other recipes in that book,"
00:02:31,00:02:35,"oatmeal mush, delicious, scraped beef."
00:02:35,00:02:36,- Scraped beef.
00:02:36,00:02:40,"- Milk lemonade, which just sounds disgusting to me."
00:02:40,00:02:42,"Apart from it contains sherry, milk lemonade."
00:02:42,00:02:44,And restorative jelly.
00:02:44,00:02:47,And the restorative part of that is it has port in it.
00:02:47,00:02:48,"- Oh, okay, nice."
00:02:48,00:02:49,- Like alko jelly kind of thing.
00:02:49,00:02:51,"- I wish we were doing hello fresh ads in this period,"
00:02:51,00:02:54,where these were the recipes that we were advertising.
00:02:54,00:02:56,"- This algae, this seaweed,"
00:02:56,00:02:57,"how do you pronounce it again, Andy?"
00:02:57,00:02:58,- I said carrageen.
00:02:58,00:02:59,"- Carrageen, yeah."
00:02:59,00:03:02,This is one of those stealth things that's in our life
00:03:02,00:03:04,in so many different ways that we don't quite recognize.
00:03:04,00:03:06,So if you look at the back of the ingredients list
00:03:06,00:03:07,"on many of the things in your house,"
00:03:07,00:03:09,you're gonna find this as one of the elements.
00:03:09,00:03:11,So it's in things like toothpaste.
00:03:11,00:03:13,It's in shampoo and cosmetics.
00:03:13,00:03:16,Firefighters use it to get a better foam
00:03:16,00:03:17,when they're fighting fires.
00:03:17,00:03:18,It's part of that.
00:03:18,00:03:19,"Yeah, it's used in that."
00:03:19,00:03:23,It's used in personal lubricants.
00:03:23,00:03:25,Check your ingredients at home.
00:03:25,00:03:26,But it's everywhere.
00:03:26,00:03:27,Shoe polish everywhere.
00:03:27,00:03:28,- Laxatives.
00:03:28,00:03:29,"- Laxatives, yeah."
00:03:29,00:03:30,- Helps those slide out.
00:03:30,00:03:33,It seems to be a couch.
00:03:33,00:03:35,- It's good for helping things slide out.
00:03:35,00:03:36,"- Yeah, yeah."
00:03:36,00:03:38,But it's very controversial.
00:03:38,00:03:40,Did you guys read about the rabid controversy
00:03:40,00:03:41,surrounding carrageen?
00:03:41,00:03:43,Well--
00:03:43,00:03:45,- Is this athletes?
00:03:45,00:03:46,"- Oh, it's not, maybe there are two."
00:03:46,00:03:47,"- Oh no, okay, okay."
00:03:47,00:03:50,"- Oh my God, okay, let's compare controversies."
00:03:50,00:03:53,This is just that it could be very bad for you
00:03:53,00:03:55,and cause deadly diseases.
00:03:55,00:03:56,It doesn't.
00:03:56,00:03:56,But--
00:03:56,00:03:57,- What?
00:03:57,00:04:00,"- Yeah, there was a roller coaster."
00:04:00,00:04:03,- 'Cause it was a very much a one dip roller coaster.
00:04:03,00:04:06,- This is a rumour that goes around in health circles
00:04:06,00:04:09,"about carrageenan, which is like the extract"
00:04:09,00:04:10,from the seaweed and carrageenan.
00:04:10,00:04:11,- Ultra concentrated.
00:04:11,00:04:12,- Essence.
00:04:12,00:04:15,"- Yes, and that is used, as we've said,"
00:04:15,00:04:15,in lots of thicknesses.
00:04:15,00:04:18,"It's also in ice cream, cottage cheese, soy milk,"
00:04:18,00:04:19,things like that.
00:04:19,00:04:22,"And there was a academic called Joanne Tabakman,"
00:04:22,00:04:25,"who I think is still going campaigning against it,"
00:04:25,00:04:28,who said a few years ago that it caused all sorts of
00:04:28,00:04:31,"cancers, Parkinson's, heart disease, things like that."
00:04:31,00:04:34,She was actually looking at a different thing.
00:04:34,00:04:36,So it turned out someone looked into the study
00:04:36,00:04:39,and she was looking at something that was called like--
00:04:39,00:04:40,- Gamma radiation.
00:04:40,00:04:44,"- Yeah, a slightly different kind of seaweed."
00:04:44,00:04:47,"But it's great, and if you go on any health website,"
00:04:47,00:04:49,"it's like avoid carrageen, it will give you cancer,"
00:04:49,00:04:51,"it'll give you heart attacks, it'll give you--"
00:04:51,00:04:52,So don't believe it.
00:04:52,00:04:54,- It's almost carcinogen.
00:04:54,00:04:56,"Like the word is very similar, isn't it?"
00:04:56,00:04:57,"- Yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:04:57,00:04:58,- Maybe that's what she studied.
00:04:58,00:04:59,"She looked at carcinogens and said,"
00:04:59,00:05:00,"""Well, these all cause cancer."""
00:05:00,00:05:03,- Next to each other in the dictionary.
00:05:03,00:05:05,- Its latter name is really fun.
00:05:05,00:05:06,It's called Chondus Crispus.
00:05:06,00:05:07,- Ah!
00:05:07,00:05:09,- It's just a nice-- - Chondus Crispus.
00:05:09,00:05:10,"- Yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:05:10,00:05:12,"- I'd like to hear about the sport in controversy,"
00:05:12,00:05:14,"and I'd like to have a guess of what it might be,"
00:05:14,00:05:17,"'cause it's like a slippery thing, right?"
00:05:17,00:05:19,So maybe they attach it to toboggan's
00:05:19,00:05:22,"when you do bobsled, and it makes you fly down the bobsled."
00:05:22,00:05:24,"- That's correct, that's absolutely right."
00:05:24,00:05:26,(laughing)
00:05:26,00:05:27,"- Or, here's another version."
00:05:27,00:05:31,"They put a load of it in the swimming pool,"
00:05:31,00:05:33,"and it thickens up the water,"
00:05:33,00:05:35,and it means that you can just run across the water
00:05:35,00:05:36,in a swimming race.
00:05:36,00:05:37,- That would help everyone though.
00:05:37,00:05:39,You have to put it in one lane.
00:05:39,00:05:40,(laughing)
00:05:40,00:05:42,"One lane, someone doing the 50 meters."
00:05:42,00:05:44,"- Yeah, okay."
00:05:44,00:05:46,"- Or you could do it in your opponent's lane,"
00:05:46,00:05:47,and so it slows them down.
00:05:47,00:05:49,- I'd also like a quarter swimming through the big pool.
00:05:49,00:05:50,- I think you have to have a lot of caragine
00:05:50,00:05:52,to turn water into a solid.
00:05:52,00:05:54,- Imagine the Olympic swimming pool.
00:05:54,00:05:56,"You've got one beautiful clear lane of water,"
00:05:56,00:05:58,"and all the others are plamange, basically."
00:05:58,00:06:01,(laughing)
00:06:01,00:06:02,- So it's neither of those things.
00:06:02,00:06:02,- It's neither of those.
00:06:02,00:06:03,"No, the Australian cricket team"
00:06:03,00:06:05,have been using it for years to--
00:06:05,00:06:07,"- No, they haven't. - Classic, all right."
00:06:07,00:06:08,(laughing)
00:06:08,00:06:10,It's bad that I believe that.
00:06:10,00:06:13,"- What it is, is actually, I don't think it's a control,"
00:06:13,00:06:14,I jumped the gun a bit.
00:06:14,00:06:15,I think it's also been used by athletes
00:06:15,00:06:18,"and bodybuilders, although I'm not completely sure"
00:06:18,00:06:19,if what capacity.
00:06:19,00:06:21,- Maybe make them smoother.
00:06:21,00:06:23,To make them look smoother.
00:06:23,00:06:25,"- That might be it, yeah."
00:06:25,00:06:27,- There's the control.
00:06:27,00:06:29,"- I said I jumped the gun on it, I really."
00:06:29,00:06:31,"But there is, okay, there is a thing."
00:06:31,00:06:34,"It's an aphrodisiac, which is good news, but for rats."
00:06:34,00:06:35,"- So, okay. - Good news for rats."
00:06:35,00:06:38,- It's fancy rats. - It's fancy rats.
00:06:38,00:06:39,"- Really, I mean, it really,"
00:06:39,00:06:41,"and I think it's a fertility aid, actually."
00:06:41,00:06:43,"It ramps up your testicles, is the phrase I've written down."
00:06:43,00:06:45,- Ramps up your testicles.
00:06:45,00:06:46,"- You don't want to put ramps up your testicles,"
00:06:46,00:06:48,that's gonna be.
00:06:48,00:06:50,"- Odd, not too much and tiny little effusions now."
00:06:50,00:06:54,"Climbing up, wheelchair-friendly testicles."
00:06:54,00:06:55,Fun.
00:06:55,00:06:56,"- What does it do, sorry, to your testicles?"
00:06:56,00:06:57,- It ramps them up.
00:06:57,00:07:00,"- What's that mean, like the outer coating,"
00:07:00,00:07:02,or like the inner ball?
00:07:02,00:07:04,"- It gives the sperm a lot more motility,"
00:07:04,00:07:06,"and I think it makes the balls bigger, maybe, as well."
00:07:06,00:07:10,"- The caragine is responsible for my fair lady,"
00:07:10,00:07:13,the musical. - Really?
00:07:13,00:07:14,"- Well, we'll see."
00:07:14,00:07:15,- Wow.
00:07:15,00:07:18,"- So, it's used in medical circuits."
00:07:18,00:07:19,"- These are terrible headlines,"
00:07:19,00:07:21,"these are like those websites, they're like,"
00:07:21,00:07:22,did you know that?
00:07:22,00:07:24,"- I mean, it's just not there."
00:07:24,00:07:26,"- The controversy, you're seaweed."
00:07:26,00:07:30,"- Well, it's used medicinally, Irish masks."
00:07:30,00:07:32,"It's good for like your throat,"
00:07:32,00:07:34,it's supposed to be good for your throat.
00:07:34,00:07:35,"In fact, there's some evidence"
00:07:35,00:07:38,"that it might stunt the replication of COVID, as well,"
00:07:38,00:07:40,although that's not certain yet.
00:07:40,00:07:42,"But anyway, the person who introduced it"
00:07:42,00:07:45,into medical use was a guy called Mr. Todd Hunter.
00:07:45,00:07:48,And Mr. Todd Hunter is more famous as a playwright.
00:07:48,00:07:50,"Okay, and he did a play called"
00:07:50,00:07:54,"The Land of Hearts Desire in Dublin,"
00:07:54,00:07:57,"and it was so bad, so, so bad,"
00:07:57,00:07:59,that everyone just booed him off.
00:07:59,00:08:01,"They kept booing him, every time he put it on,"
00:08:01,00:08:02,"they booed him off, they booed him off,"
00:08:02,00:08:06,"was taken off the rotor of the playhouse,"
00:08:06,00:08:09,"and it was replaced by Arms of the Man,"
00:08:09,00:08:12,"which was the first success of George Bernard Shaw,"
00:08:12,00:08:13,"who went on to write Pygmalion,"
00:08:13,00:08:15,which my fair lady was based on.
00:08:15,00:08:16,- Yes. - I was gonna guess that.
00:08:16,00:08:17,- Yeah. - Yeah.
00:08:17,00:08:18,- That's flawless. - That's amazing.
00:08:18,00:08:21,"- Actually, I think that does check out, that's great."
00:08:21,00:08:25,"I've got in my notes here, I don't know who wrote these."
00:08:25,00:08:28,"The Irish Moss saved America,"
00:08:28,00:08:33,"because there was a lot of it grown in the USA,"
00:08:33,00:08:37,"and there, in fact, there's a town near Boston,"
00:08:37,00:08:39,it's called Skituate.
00:08:40,00:08:43,"Skituated, very near Boston, brilliant,"
00:08:43,00:08:46,"which is, supposedly, it calls itself"
00:08:46,00:08:48,"the most Irish town in the whole of the USA,"
00:08:48,00:08:51,"about 50% of the population there are Irish,"
00:08:51,00:08:52,"and from the 1840s onwards,"
00:08:52,00:08:55,"it was a big site for Irish moss farming,"
00:08:55,00:08:57,"as in they farmed it, they grew it."
00:08:57,00:09:01,"- Yeah, you get it, it kind of comes onto the shore"
00:09:01,00:09:03,"in North America and in Europe, doesn't it?"
00:09:03,00:09:05,"- Exactly, yeah, yeah, and he saw some in the water,"
00:09:05,00:09:06,"and he thought, wait, I know that,"
00:09:06,00:09:07,"I recognize that from when I was in Ireland,"
00:09:07,00:09:10,"and so he set up the industry, basically,"
00:09:10,00:09:11,this guy who's called Daniel Ward.
00:09:11,00:09:14,"Anyway, so it became big, big, big industry for this town."
00:09:14,00:09:15,"During the Second World War,"
00:09:15,00:09:17,"suddenly, there was a thing called agar,"
00:09:17,00:09:19,"it's an agar jelly, you know?"
00:09:19,00:09:20,"That was no longer available,"
00:09:20,00:09:22,'cause that was grown in the Far East.
00:09:22,00:09:26,"- Okay, and you need agar to grow bacteria and stuff?"
00:09:26,00:09:27,"- Well, it's a thickening agent,"
00:09:27,00:09:29,"it's in all sorts of foods,"
00:09:29,00:09:30,"and basically, it was no longer available,"
00:09:30,00:09:32,"'cause it was largely grown in Japan and places like that,"
00:09:32,00:09:35,which were obviously no longer trading with the USA.
00:09:35,00:09:37,"Irish moss carrion, and basically,"
00:09:37,00:09:39,rocketed in production.
00:09:39,00:09:43,"In Canada, they made 261,000 pounds in 1941."
00:09:43,00:09:45,"The next year, they made over 2 million pounds"
00:09:45,00:09:48,of this stuff for use in foods.
00:09:48,00:09:50,"Yeah, it was a huge deal."
00:09:50,00:09:52,- And why did it save America?
00:09:52,00:09:52,- Well--
00:09:52,00:09:53,"- Otherwise, they would have starved to death"
00:09:53,00:09:55,if they didn't have ice cream or whatever.
00:09:55,00:09:57,"- Well, they wouldn't have had pleasant sauces,"
00:09:57,00:09:59,"drinks of war, in fact, on morale."
00:09:59,00:10:02,"- Yeah, yeah, is it called the man in the high castle,"
00:10:02,00:10:03,where they imagined that the Germans
00:10:03,00:10:04,had won the Second World War?
00:10:05,00:10:07,"- I think we should make a prequel of it,"
00:10:07,00:10:09,where we actually look at what the reason
00:10:09,00:10:12,"they lost the war, and it was because of this lack of aga."
00:10:12,00:10:14,"- Probably, that's huge, yeah."
00:10:14,00:10:15,- That's right.
00:10:15,00:10:16,"- So, are you buying that?"
00:10:16,00:10:17,- Nope.
00:10:17,00:10:18,(laughing)
00:10:18,00:10:19,- You know how we were saying
00:10:19,00:10:20,that carrageen was in health food?
00:10:20,00:10:23,"Always has been, many thousands of years has been round,"
00:10:23,00:10:25,and I came across an article in the New York Times
00:10:25,00:10:28,"in, I think it was, like, 1904 or something,"
00:10:28,00:10:30,"and it was, I just found it really amusing"
00:10:30,00:10:32,how little the police obviously had to do at this time.
00:10:32,00:10:36,"So, it was a story about how a Romanian gypsy woman"
00:10:36,00:10:40,"had been arrested in Jamaica for charging over $7,000,"
00:10:40,00:10:43,"which was a lot then, for basically Irish moss."
00:10:43,00:10:45,- It's a lot now for Irish moss.
00:10:45,00:10:46,- It's good.
00:10:46,00:10:46,"- It is, don't pay that for Irish moss."
00:10:46,00:10:48,- But how much Irish moss are we talking about?
00:10:48,00:10:50,- It was a very small tincture
00:10:50,00:10:52,"dropped in a glass of water, in secret."
00:10:52,00:10:53,"- $7,000?"
00:10:53,00:10:54,"- Yeah, it's too much, isn't it?"
00:10:54,00:10:55,- Who's the buyer?
00:10:55,00:10:58,"- Well, it was this lady who had a hunchback"
00:10:58,00:11:00,"that she wanted cured, so she employed a healer,"
00:11:00,00:11:02,this woman who said she was Romanian.
00:11:02,00:11:05,"Anyway, the healer said she boiled some water,"
00:11:05,00:11:06,"she covered it with cloth and she said,"
00:11:06,00:11:09,"""Look at that water, don't touch it, don't move,"
00:11:09,00:11:12,"""don't tell anyone for 24 hours what I've done,"
00:11:12,00:11:13,"""and then you'll be cured."""
00:11:13,00:11:16,"And the woman, idiot, ruined the cure by telling her mates,"
00:11:16,00:11:17,"she was like, ""Look, I've employed this doctor,"
00:11:17,00:11:19,"""but I'm a bit suspicious about the cure,"""
00:11:19,00:11:20,"'cause she just told me to, like,"
00:11:20,00:11:22,not touch this glass of water for 24 hours.
00:11:22,00:11:24,"- For 24 hours, while she goes to the coast"
00:11:24,00:11:26,"and gets the nearest ship with her new $7,000."
00:11:26,00:11:27,"- Well, no, 'cause she'd only charged,"
00:11:27,00:11:28,"like, a hundred at that point."
00:11:28,00:11:30,"So, the woman reported it to the police."
00:11:30,00:11:32,"Two detectives came to her house,"
00:11:32,00:11:34,"hid behind the curtains,"
00:11:34,00:11:37,"and the Romanian lady came back to say,"
00:11:37,00:11:39,"""You know, okay, that was the first step,"
00:11:39,00:11:41,"""now the next step comes,"""
00:11:41,00:11:44,and the detectives saw her slip some Irish moss
00:11:44,00:11:46,"into the water and then say,"
00:11:46,00:11:49,"""Okay, now I'm gonna charge you $7,000,"""
00:11:49,00:11:51,"and then, as she was gonna hand over the money"
00:11:51,00:11:53,"in the details, the detectives jumped up."
00:11:53,00:11:56,- Do you get police doing that much these days?
00:11:56,00:11:57,"Sort of, ""We'll come into your house,"
00:11:57,00:11:58,"""hide behind your curtains."""
00:11:58,00:11:59,- I think that's fine. - That's whether you don't.
00:11:59,00:12:01,I think it's a disgrace.
00:12:01,00:12:02,"I want, for my taxes,"
00:12:02,00:12:05,I want policemen hiding behind my curtains
00:12:05,00:12:06,every day of the week.
00:12:06,00:12:07,- Did she have an exact time she was coming back?
00:12:07,00:12:10,How long were the police hiding behind the curtains?
00:12:10,00:12:11,- She said Wednesday.
00:12:11,00:12:14,- Passing another cup of tea behind the curtains.
00:12:14,00:12:16,(laughing)
00:12:16,00:12:17,"- She had to knock,"
00:12:17,00:12:18,"so they could just hang out in the kitchen,"
00:12:18,00:12:19,"I suppose, until--"
00:12:19,00:12:20,- Like a surprise party.
00:12:20,00:12:22,"Everyone, everyone, quick, quick, quick, quick."
00:12:22,00:12:23,"- Exactly, exactly."
00:12:23,00:12:24,"- False alarm, it's an Amazon delivery."
00:12:24,00:12:27,- Did you guys hear about Mim Flynn?
00:12:27,00:12:28,- Mim Flynn. - Mim Flynn.
00:12:28,00:12:30,- The Irish mossing queen?
00:12:30,00:12:30,- No. - No.
00:12:30,00:12:32,(laughing)
00:12:32,00:12:34,"- She was, she wasn't a beauty queen or anything."
00:12:34,00:12:38,She was the queen of the Irish moss industry
00:12:38,00:12:40,"because she was a great mosser,"
00:12:40,00:12:42,and she started at the age of nine.
00:12:42,00:12:44,- Is a mosser someone who eats it or who collects it?
00:12:44,00:12:45,- Harvested it.
00:12:45,00:12:48,"- I think she was in Skituate, Skituate."
00:12:48,00:12:50,- I thought you said she was Irish.
00:12:50,00:12:51,"- No, Irish moss."
00:12:51,00:12:52,"- Oh, I see."
00:12:52,00:12:53,"- Oh, where was she? - She was the--"
00:12:53,00:12:54,- America. - In Skituate.
00:12:54,00:12:57,- She was the American Irish mossing--
00:12:57,00:12:59,- Did we not pay attention?
00:12:59,00:13:00,Remember his hilarious pun earlier?
00:13:00,00:13:02,- It's just outside Boston.
00:13:02,00:13:03,"- I blank them out too, but--"
00:13:03,00:13:06,"- Skituated, just outside Boston."
00:13:06,00:13:09,- I must not have been here at the time.
00:13:09,00:13:10,- I didn't hear.
00:13:10,00:13:11,- I don't think I was.
00:13:11,00:13:12,- I don't think there was any evidence.
00:13:12,00:13:15,"- Audio, imagine if I had to out your original paper."
00:13:15,00:13:18,(laughing)
00:13:18,00:13:19,"- So, but yeah, give us more about her."
00:13:19,00:13:21,Is she-- - How's she doing?
00:13:21,00:13:23,- I think she's passed away now.
00:13:23,00:13:23,- Right.
00:13:23,00:13:24,"- But Skituate these days,"
00:13:24,00:13:26,it does have a mossing museum.
00:13:26,00:13:27,- Cool.
00:13:27,00:13:28,- Yeah. - Is it?
00:13:28,00:13:29,"- Yeah, yeah."
00:13:29,00:13:31,There's no longer much of an industry as Moot Evices.
00:13:31,00:13:32,"- Well, if you're in Skituate,"
00:13:32,00:13:34,and you're wondering what to do.
00:13:34,00:13:37,"- Yeah, also, I've probably said Skituate wrong."
00:13:37,00:13:37,That all the way through.
00:13:37,00:13:40,"- So, look on the map, don't ask a local."
00:13:40,00:13:40,"- Yeah, yeah."
00:13:40,00:13:43,"Get a pair of compasses, put the middle point in Boston,"
00:13:43,00:13:45,"and the other arm to 30 miles,"
00:13:45,00:13:47,and it'll be on that line.
00:13:47,00:13:48,- Which way? - Which way?
00:13:48,00:13:49,- Which way?
00:13:49,00:13:51,"- Well, it'll be coastal."
00:13:51,00:13:53,"So, I only know it's 30 miles outside Boston."
00:13:53,00:13:54,"- Okay, cool."
00:13:54,00:13:55,(laughing)
00:13:55,00:13:56,"- Just go 30 miles south of Boston,"
00:13:56,00:13:57,"along the coast, and if it's not there,"
00:13:57,00:13:59,go 60 miles north.
00:13:59,00:14:01,(laughing)
00:14:01,00:14:02,"- So, just on Belmont,"
00:14:02,00:14:04,we should talk about the fact that
00:14:04,00:14:05,it was only quite recently
00:14:05,00:14:06,that it stopped containing meat.
00:14:06,00:14:08,- Yeah. - Yeah.
00:14:08,00:14:08,- Really? - Yeah.
00:14:08,00:14:09,Weird.
00:14:09,00:14:10,"So, Belmont's been around since,"
00:14:10,00:14:11,I think the earliest recipe
00:14:11,00:14:13,"maybe comes from Baghdad in the 10th century,"
00:14:13,00:14:15,"a long time,"
00:14:15,00:14:17,and it was only in the 18th century
00:14:17,00:14:19,"they thought, ""Let's stop putting chicken in this."""
00:14:19,00:14:19,- Yeah.
00:14:19,00:14:20,(laughing)
00:14:20,00:14:22,- It just sounds so rough.
00:14:22,00:14:24,"- They just used chicken as,"
00:14:24,00:14:26,"basically, in the same way"
00:14:26,00:14:27,that they used this seaweed
00:14:27,00:14:29,"as kind of to make it more gelatinous,"
00:14:29,00:14:31,to make it stringy.
00:14:31,00:14:32,"It had a pleasant stringiness, I think."
00:14:32,00:14:33,"- Oh, lovely."
00:14:33,00:14:35,"- And you shredded and really pounded up the chicken,"
00:14:35,00:14:37,"so it lost all of its flavor, I believe,"
00:14:37,00:14:40,and mixed it up with some almond milk
00:14:40,00:14:43,and some sugar and some rice.
00:14:43,00:14:45,"And yum, and they still eat it in turkey,"
00:14:45,00:14:46,"almost the same thing, it seems like."
00:14:46,00:14:47,"- Oh, really?"
00:14:47,00:14:48,What actually would the chicken in still?
00:14:48,00:14:51,"- Yeah, yeah, it's called tavuk gogsu,"
00:14:51,00:14:53,"and it literally means,"
00:14:53,00:14:54,and I really want English people to have gone
00:14:54,00:14:56,"and ordered it, having done the Google translate,"
00:14:56,00:14:58,'cause it literally means chicken breast.
00:14:58,00:15:01,"But you order it, and what you get is a blamange."
00:15:01,00:15:03,(laughing)
00:15:03,00:15:04,"You look at everything on the menu,"
00:15:04,00:15:06,"and you're like, ""Oh, I can't, I don't want that, I don't."""
00:15:06,00:15:07,"Oh, chicken breast!"
00:15:07,00:15:09,(laughing)
00:15:09,00:15:10,That's safe.
00:15:10,00:15:13,"- What a weird-ass chicken, so they have it in turkey."
00:15:13,00:15:14,- Have you guys heard of Bompas and Pa?
00:15:14,00:15:15,- No.
00:15:15,00:15:16,"- They're a jelly innovation firm,"
00:15:16,00:15:19,and they basically do absolutely mad things
00:15:19,00:15:20,with jelly all the time.
00:15:20,00:15:23,"They're constantly coming up with incredible innovations,"
00:15:23,00:15:25,"and weird flavors, and anyway,"
00:15:25,00:15:27,I just look through a list of all the things
00:15:27,00:15:28,they've done over the years.
00:15:28,00:15:31,"One year, for Valentine's Day, they created a jelly"
00:15:31,00:15:34,which was called throbber.
00:15:34,00:15:35,"- Oh, boy."
00:15:35,00:15:37,"- THROBR, which I can--"
00:15:37,00:15:38,"- Sounds like an app, doesn't it?"
00:15:38,00:15:40,- It does sound like an app.
00:15:40,00:15:42,It's amazing what this jelly does.
00:15:42,00:15:44,"It locks onto your heart rate,"
00:15:44,00:15:48,and it pulses in time with your heart rate
00:15:48,00:15:50,as you're eating it.
00:15:50,00:15:51,I don't know.
00:15:51,00:15:53,So if you get very excited as you're eating
00:15:53,00:15:55,"the jelly, the jelly itself will start reflecting that."
00:15:55,00:15:58,"- It does feel like, 'cause it's called throbber,"
00:15:58,00:16:01,"that perhaps, if you got an erection,"
00:16:01,00:16:04,"the stiffer your erection, the stiffer the jelly"
00:16:04,00:16:05,would get.
00:16:05,00:16:06,(all laughing)
00:16:06,00:16:08,- Make a steak knife for this one.
00:16:08,00:16:10,(all laughing)
00:16:10,00:16:18,"- Okay, it is time for fact number two,"
00:16:18,00:16:20,and that is James.
00:16:20,00:16:22,"- Okay, my fact this week is that when communism fell"
00:16:22,00:16:26,"in Czechoslovakia, the US ambassador in the country"
00:16:26,00:16:27,was Shirley Temple.
00:16:27,00:16:29,(all laughing)
00:16:29,00:16:30,- Really weird.
00:16:30,00:16:32,- I think this is amazing.
00:16:32,00:16:33,Some people might know this already.
00:16:33,00:16:35,"I've spoken to one or two people who have,"
00:16:35,00:16:39,"but to me, Shirley Temple is a child movie star"
00:16:39,00:16:41,who basically retired when she was 10 years old.
00:16:41,00:16:42,- Exactly.
00:16:42,00:16:44,"- But actually, when she got a bit older,"
00:16:44,00:16:46,"when she was 44, she became a diplomat,"
00:16:46,00:16:48,and she did loads of stuff for the US.
00:16:48,00:16:52,"She was the first woman to serve as US ambassador to Ghana,"
00:16:52,00:16:56,but she was also the ambassador in Czechoslovakia in 1989
00:16:56,00:16:58,"when the Velvet Revolution happened,"
00:16:58,00:17:02,"and the communist regime fell in what is now Czechia,"
00:17:02,00:17:03,and Slovakia.
00:17:03,00:17:04,- Yeah. - Amazing.
00:17:04,00:17:05,- It is amazing.
00:17:05,00:17:07,"- Weirdly, she was sort of there"
00:17:07,00:17:09,"towards the start as well, wasn't she?"
00:17:09,00:17:11,She thinks maybe one of the things that helped her
00:17:11,00:17:13,"get that gig was the fact that in the '60s,"
00:17:13,00:17:16,"she'd been in Czechoslovakia,"
00:17:16,00:17:19,"and I think she was working for a multiple sclerosis foundation,"
00:17:19,00:17:20,which is where she got her taste
00:17:20,00:17:22,"for international diplomacy and stuff,"
00:17:22,00:17:23,"so her brother had MS,"
00:17:23,00:17:26,and so she founded this organization.
00:17:26,00:17:28,"She was doing some international work in Czechoslovakia,"
00:17:28,00:17:31,and she happened to be there at the time
00:17:31,00:17:32,that the Russians basically invaded
00:17:32,00:17:35,"to crush the uprising, to crush the Prague Spring,"
00:17:35,00:17:38,"and yeah, she remembers watching from her balcony"
00:17:38,00:17:40,"as a woman got gunned down,"
00:17:40,00:17:42,"and that made her think, yeah,"
00:17:42,00:17:43,I'll take a career in diplomacy.
00:17:43,00:17:44,(laughing)
00:17:44,00:17:46,"- Yeah, the other thing was that she married"
00:17:46,00:17:49,"her second husband in, I think, in her 30s,"
00:17:49,00:17:52,"and he was an aquaculture engineer and oceanographer,"
00:17:52,00:17:55,so that also got her to go into the environmental side
00:17:55,00:17:57,"of diplomacy, so that was part of it."
00:17:57,00:18:00,"- She's really, I mean, so she did have political ambitions"
00:18:00,00:18:01,outside of being an ambassador.
00:18:01,00:18:04,She was a Republican candidate.
00:18:04,00:18:07,"She wanted to run for the House of Representatives in 1967,"
00:18:07,00:18:11,"and she lost out to a guy called Congressman Pete McCloskey,"
00:18:11,00:18:14,but she obviously had close relationships
00:18:14,00:18:16,"with the leading Republicans at the time,"
00:18:16,00:18:18,because it was under Gerald Ford
00:18:18,00:18:20,that she was the ambassador to Ghana.
00:18:20,00:18:22,She was under Ronald Reagan when she did another
00:18:22,00:18:24,"of her posts, and then the Czechoslovakia one"
00:18:24,00:18:28,"was George H.W. Bush, Bush Sr."
00:18:28,00:18:30,"She must have been really good mates with them,"
00:18:30,00:18:33,"and you can see that this child stock,"
00:18:33,00:18:35,'cause Shirley Temple really is even to my generation.
00:18:35,00:18:37,I used to watch her movies in black and white as a kid.
00:18:37,00:18:39,"Like, I know-- - When were you born?"
00:18:39,00:18:41,(laughing)
00:18:41,00:18:43,"- Danny, you're 100 years old."
00:18:43,00:18:44,"- Right, okay."
00:18:44,00:18:46,"- Yeah, no, but no, like, she's still a name"
00:18:46,00:18:47,that most of us know.
00:18:47,00:18:50,"I mean, largely it might because of the drink,"
00:18:50,00:18:53,the non-alcoholic mocktail that you can get.
00:18:53,00:18:54,"- But before this, I thought Shirley Temple,"
00:18:54,00:18:57,"old child, sort of, like, curly hair, child actor,"
00:18:57,00:18:59,"like, hugely famous child star,"
00:18:59,00:19:00,and also non-alcoholic drink.
00:19:00,00:19:02,"- I only thought Good Ship Lollipop,"
00:19:02,00:19:03,which was that song that she sang.
00:19:03,00:19:05,That's basically all I know about.
00:19:05,00:19:06,"- But in a lot of her early films,"
00:19:06,00:19:08,"she preaches fiscal responsibility,"
00:19:08,00:19:11,"and the importance of a low-tax, small state."
00:19:11,00:19:13,So it's kind of unsurprising that her--
00:19:13,00:19:14,"- That's who we should have seen it, actually."
00:19:14,00:19:17,"- She was an independent Republican candidate,"
00:19:17,00:19:20,"I think, for the 1967 election"
00:19:20,00:19:22,to be a part of the U.S. House of Representatives.
00:19:22,00:19:23,- What does that mean in the end?
00:19:23,00:19:25,"- I believe that it means she was Republican,"
00:19:25,00:19:28,"but she wasn't officially on the ticket, I think."
00:19:28,00:19:29,I'm not sure about that.
00:19:29,00:19:31,"But she said during the election,"
00:19:31,00:19:33,"""I think men are fine and here to stay,"
00:19:33,00:19:35,"""but I have a hunch that it wouldn't hurt"
00:19:35,00:19:37,"""to have a woman's viewpoint expressed"
00:19:37,00:19:39,"""in that delegation of 38 men."""
00:19:39,00:19:42,"- Mmm, yeah. - Too much too soon, Shirley."
00:19:42,00:19:43,(laughing)
00:19:43,00:19:45,"- She started, okay, so she's a child actor, as we know,"
00:19:45,00:19:47,in sort of like age six.
00:19:47,00:19:49,She was already winning like special Oscars
00:19:49,00:19:50,that were being given to her.
00:19:50,00:19:51,"Like, she was a big deal."
00:19:51,00:19:53,"What's, I did not know this."
00:19:53,00:19:56,There's something quite seedy about her intro
00:19:56,00:19:57,into the world of acting.
00:19:57,00:19:59,Nothing against her.
00:19:59,00:20:00,It's her parents who obviously signed her up.
00:20:00,00:20:02,"She was three at the time, you know."
00:20:02,00:20:05,And it was part of this thing called baby burlesques.
00:20:05,00:20:08,"- Yes, it's incredibly weird."
00:20:08,00:20:09,"- Yeah, did you watch it?"
00:20:09,00:20:10,'Cause I didn't.
00:20:10,00:20:12,(laughing)
00:20:12,00:20:15,- The bad news is we've all had our laptops taken away.
00:20:15,00:20:17,(laughing)
00:20:17,00:20:18,"Is it online, I assume, or is it not?"
00:20:18,00:20:19,"- It must be somewhere, right?"
00:20:19,00:20:21,- It must be historical.
00:20:21,00:20:22,- 'Cause it's quite obscure.
00:20:22,00:20:23,It's like early 30s.
00:20:23,00:20:24,I think it's hard.
00:20:24,00:20:25,I couldn't find an online version.
00:20:25,00:20:26,There's one film which I reckon you can get
00:20:26,00:20:27,on YouTube if you tried.
00:20:27,00:20:29,"- Oh, it's on the dark web."
00:20:29,00:20:31,(laughing)
00:20:31,00:20:33,"- So what, yeah, sorry, Dad, you should tell what it was."
00:20:33,00:20:35,"- Yeah, okay, so it's described by The New York Times"
00:20:35,00:20:38,as a series of sexually suggestive one real shorts
00:20:38,00:20:40,in which children played all the roles.
00:20:40,00:20:42,"- Yeah, so what it was is basically"
00:20:42,00:20:45,they were parodies of films for grown-ups.
00:20:45,00:20:49,"So at the time, all the grown-up stars"
00:20:49,00:20:51,"were people like Marlena Dietrich and Mae West,"
00:20:51,00:20:54,and they were obviously very sexy women
00:20:54,00:20:56,with very flirtatious dialogue.
00:20:56,00:20:57,"And these baby burlesques,"
00:20:57,00:21:00,they kind of did parody versions of these films
00:21:00,00:21:02,where there are children playing the roles.
00:21:02,00:21:03,"- Like Bugsie Malone, I guess, right?"
00:21:03,00:21:04,Is like a close version of it.
00:21:04,00:21:07,"- Yeah, but not with like saucy dialogue."
00:21:07,00:21:08,- It's so weird. - I'm a three-year-old.
00:21:08,00:21:09,- So weird.
00:21:09,00:21:11,- In defense of the olden days.
00:21:11,00:21:14,"- Oh, come on. - I think it was probably okay."
00:21:14,00:21:16,"It was a comedy, and they wore,"
00:21:16,00:21:19,"so they'd wear sexy outfits on the top half,"
00:21:19,00:21:21,"and then they'd have their nappies on,"
00:21:21,00:21:22,"on the bottom half,"
00:21:22,00:21:24,like they're doing kind of a Zoom meeting from home.
00:21:24,00:21:26,(laughing)
00:21:26,00:21:28,- I don't think it would get made today.
00:21:28,00:21:29,- No. - And the stories
00:21:29,00:21:30,that Shirley Temple would tell about it
00:21:30,00:21:32,"in later in her autobiography,"
00:21:32,00:21:34,"where she'd say that if they got in trouble,"
00:21:34,00:21:37,the kids that were part of this production
00:21:37,00:21:39,would be sent off to a sound booth
00:21:39,00:21:41,where they'd have to sit on a block of ice.
00:21:41,00:21:43,"- Apparently, every night,"
00:21:43,00:21:46,Shirley Temple's mother would curl her hair
00:21:46,00:21:48,"into 56 perfect curls,"
00:21:48,00:21:49,so she would have to sit there
00:21:49,00:21:51,and do her hair every single night.
00:21:51,00:21:53,"And then she would be read a bedtime story,"
00:21:53,00:21:56,but the bedtime story was the next day's script
00:21:56,00:21:57,that she had to learn.
00:21:57,00:21:59,"And so the mother would read the lines from the script,"
00:21:59,00:22:00,"and she'd have to parrot them back,"
00:22:00,00:22:02,and she'd keep doing that until she fell asleep.
00:22:02,00:22:03,"- So Shirley Temple's mom got her,"
00:22:03,00:22:06,"she does sound like a proper, classic,"
00:22:06,00:22:10,"good old fashioned Hollywood insane pushy mum, as in."
00:22:10,00:22:13,She ensured that other child actors
00:22:13,00:22:15,who might threaten her daughter's roles
00:22:15,00:22:16,had their parts cut.
00:22:16,00:22:17,- Which parts?
00:22:17,00:22:19,(laughing)
00:22:19,00:22:21,"Body parts. - Fingers, yeah, yeah."
00:22:21,00:22:23,"And so she was very protective,"
00:22:23,00:22:26,"very, very forceful in getting Shirley too fame."
00:22:26,00:22:30,"Also, one thing she stole from Shirley Temple herself"
00:22:30,00:22:31,was the year of her life.
00:22:31,00:22:33,She knocked a year off Shirley Temple's age.
00:22:33,00:22:35,So Shirley was at her--
00:22:35,00:22:37,- That's actually giving someone an extra year.
00:22:37,00:22:39,"- Oh my God, she's the perfect mum."
00:22:39,00:22:40,(laughing)
00:22:40,00:22:42,"- I mean, if my mum could suddenly turn around"
00:22:42,00:22:44,"and say that I'm 35, that'd be great."
00:22:44,00:22:45,"- Well, no, but she wouldn't be."
00:22:45,00:22:47,"She'd be telling you a year, as in,"
00:22:47,00:22:50,"so Shirley Temple was at her 12th birthday party,"
00:22:50,00:22:52,"and her mum said, ""Oh, by the way, you're 13."""
00:22:52,00:22:55,"- Ah, well, but when she was nine,"
00:22:55,00:22:56,they said that she was eight.
00:22:56,00:22:58,"- But that's why, so that's because"
00:22:58,00:23:00,it's all part of the same story.
00:23:00,00:23:01,- It's all the same process.
00:23:01,00:23:03,"See, when she was three or four, her mum thought,"
00:23:03,00:23:05,"""Oh no, she's getting a bit too old"
00:23:05,00:23:06,"""for this whole baby game."""
00:23:06,00:23:07,"Like, she's about to be,"
00:23:07,00:23:09,"no, I think she was about to turn five and a half"
00:23:09,00:23:10,"or something, so her mum was like,"
00:23:10,00:23:12,"""Right, we're gonna make her four and a half again."""
00:23:12,00:23:14,"And then Shirley, from the age of four and a half,"
00:23:14,00:23:16,"thought that she was four and a half,"
00:23:16,00:23:17,"five and a half, six and a half,"
00:23:17,00:23:18,and then it was when she was 12
00:23:18,00:23:20,"that her mum went, ""Actually, surprise."""
00:23:20,00:23:22,Welcome to a teenagerhood.
00:23:22,00:23:24,- She's like turning the clock back in the autumn
00:23:24,00:23:26,and turning it forward again in the spring.
00:23:26,00:23:27,"- Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. - Exactly."
00:23:27,00:23:28,"- So your mum could do this for you, James,"
00:23:28,00:23:30,but you'd be on borrowed time.
00:23:30,00:23:34,- I'm perhaps borrowing time at this stage of my life.
00:23:34,00:23:37,I am up for borrowing any time I can borrow.
00:23:37,00:23:41,"And on her eighth birthday, so she was actually nine,"
00:23:41,00:23:43,"but she was, I thought she was eight,"
00:23:43,00:23:46,"she got 135,000 gifts."
00:23:46,00:23:48,"- Yeah, that's amazing, isn't it?"
00:23:48,00:23:49,- Pretty amazing.
00:23:49,00:23:51,"And it was sent to her by fans around the world, right?"
00:23:51,00:23:53,"- No, all from her mum. - It wasn't just her parents,"
00:23:53,00:23:54,"yeah, her mum was, yeah."
00:23:54,00:23:58,- She got a kangaroo from Australia.
00:23:58,00:23:59,"- That's a burden, anything. - What?"
00:23:59,00:24:00,- Is it?
00:24:00,00:24:02,"Well, you can keep other presents in the pouch."
00:24:02,00:24:05,"- Good point, guys, it's a suitcase."
00:24:05,00:24:08,"- Yeah, it sounds, her life just sounds insane."
00:24:08,00:24:11,She was the biggest box office star of the year
00:24:11,00:24:13,"in 1936, '37, and '38,"
00:24:13,00:24:15,"which I think were the years where she was eight, nine,"
00:24:15,00:24:16,"and 10, I mean."
00:24:16,00:24:18,- She's the biggest child star that's ever been.
00:24:18,00:24:20,"There's been no contest ever since, really."
00:24:20,00:24:22,- Carly Culkin is the only other one I could think of.
00:24:22,00:24:24,"- I think in terms of the amount she earned at the time,"
00:24:24,00:24:26,the fact that she was the only person
00:24:26,00:24:28,"anyone wanted in any films,"
00:24:28,00:24:29,"between the ages of three and 10,"
00:24:29,00:24:31,she was in 29 films.
00:24:31,00:24:35,"1935, her salary was $2,500 a week."
00:24:35,00:24:37,"This is when she was seven, six or seven."
00:24:37,00:24:39,- That was a lot of money in those days.
00:24:39,00:24:42,It wasn't just like a third of a tincture of Iron Moss.
00:24:42,00:24:47,"- God, her house was stuffed with Iron Moss though, wow."
00:24:47,00:24:48,She was also responsible
00:24:48,00:24:51,"for quite a random bit of cultural input, possibly,"
00:24:51,00:24:54,"and that is the Novel, The Power and the Glory."
00:24:54,00:24:54,- Okay.
00:24:54,00:24:58,"- By Graham Greene, and this is because"
00:24:58,00:25:00,she had sort of a feud with Graham Greene
00:25:00,00:25:02,"at the age of sort of nine, eight or nine."
00:25:02,00:25:05,"- It's so funny, I didn't celebrate with you."
00:25:05,00:25:08,"- Do you remember in the 90s or the early 2000s,"
00:25:08,00:25:10,they used to have celebrity boxing
00:25:10,00:25:12,"and like Ricky Gervais fought with,"
00:25:12,00:25:14,"I don't know, some random person."
00:25:14,00:25:15,- Did they?
00:25:15,00:25:16,"- Yeah, yeah."
00:25:16,00:25:16,- I don't remember that.
00:25:16,00:25:18,"- Like Patrick Kilty or something like that, yeah."
00:25:18,00:25:21,- I just want to see Graham Greene in Shirley Temple.
00:25:21,00:25:22,- Clocking Shirley Temple.
00:25:22,00:25:25,- That is a pay-per-view I would pay for.
00:25:25,00:25:26,- I think I'd back Shirley.
00:25:26,00:25:29,She was pretty tough under those ringlets.
00:25:29,00:25:30,He was quite mean about her.
00:25:30,00:25:33,"He wrote a review of her films saying,"
00:25:33,00:25:35,sort of suggesting that she was trained
00:25:35,00:25:37,to deliberately be a bit cocket-ish.
00:25:37,00:25:40,Saying she symbolized dimpled depravity.
00:25:40,00:25:41,She had a well-developed rump.
00:25:41,00:25:44,And suggesting that her films were targeting
00:25:44,00:25:45,sleazy middle-aged men.
00:25:45,00:25:49,And it's unclear how humorous he was being.
00:25:49,00:25:51,"Having read it, I don't think he was being that humorous."
00:25:51,00:25:53,I think it was just a pretty nasty review.
00:25:53,00:25:57,"And then her mum and Fox decided to sue him for slander,"
00:25:57,00:25:59,"for saying that, for suggesting that."
00:25:59,00:26:02,"And he, according to a friend who wrote a biography of him,"
00:26:02,00:26:07,"years later, he realized that he was about to be sued."
00:26:07,00:26:08,And so he might go to prison.
00:26:08,00:26:12,"So he fled from England, where he was, to Mexico,"
00:26:12,00:26:14,which didn't have any extradition rules.
00:26:14,00:26:17,"And in Mexico, that was where he was inspired to write,"
00:26:17,00:26:19,"maybe his greatest magnum opus,"
00:26:19,00:26:21,"Para and the Glory, set in Mexico."
00:26:21,00:26:21,- Done a case.
00:26:21,00:26:22,- About oppression of Catholics.
00:26:22,00:26:26,"- As an adult, she broke the ice, whatever,"
00:26:26,00:26:27,she sent him a copy.
00:26:27,00:26:29,- She was been sitting on all that time.
00:26:29,00:26:31,"- She sent him a copy of her autobiography,"
00:26:31,00:26:32,and she invited him to tea.
00:26:32,00:26:34,So clearly there weren't very many hard feelings
00:26:34,00:26:35,on her part.
00:26:35,00:26:37,"- Well, she was a diplomat, wasn't she?"
00:26:37,00:26:38,"- Oh, yeah, there you go."
00:26:38,00:26:41,"- Well, she had got 3,500 pounds"
00:26:41,00:26:43,from Graham Greene in the settlement.
00:26:43,00:26:44,"- I wonder how much she saw of that, though."
00:26:44,00:26:45,"I haven't got this written down,"
00:26:45,00:26:47,"but I do, in the course of reading,"
00:26:47,00:26:49,remember that a lot of the money was taken
00:26:49,00:26:51,by the parents and wasn't seen by Shirley.
00:26:51,00:26:52,So I've got the figures.
00:26:52,00:26:53,"- Yeah, what are they?"
00:26:53,00:26:57,"- Right, she earned $3,200,000 in her acting career,"
00:26:57,00:26:59,quite a lot of money at the time.
00:26:59,00:27:01,"By the time she was 22 years old,"
00:27:01,00:27:03,"there was $44,000 left."
00:27:03,00:27:05,- And was that because it was depleted by her parents?
00:27:05,00:27:06,"- It was her dad, right?"
00:27:06,00:27:08,"So her dad was a banker,"
00:27:08,00:27:10,"and so he was in charge of all of her money,"
00:27:10,00:27:13,"obviously her parents, they would be,"
00:27:13,00:27:14,but she'd never blamed him.
00:27:14,00:27:16,She reckons that he got duped.
00:27:16,00:27:18,So basically he made a load of bad investments
00:27:18,00:27:20,"because people could see he was making a load of money,"
00:27:20,00:27:22,"and he didn't really, you know, he wasn't the greatest."
00:27:22,00:27:24,He left school when he was in seventh grade.
00:27:24,00:27:25,He wasn't the greatest banker of all time.
00:27:25,00:27:26,- I wonder if she was a banker?
00:27:26,00:27:29,"He was kind of like a monopoly banker, basically."
00:27:29,00:27:30,"""I'll be the banker, yeah, great."""
00:27:30,00:27:31,- They should have looked underneath the bar.
00:27:31,00:27:33,That's where the money would have been.
00:27:33,00:27:35,"But yeah, she said that she didn't blame him one little bit,"
00:27:35,00:27:37,and it was the people that counseled him
00:27:37,00:27:39,"who were the bad guys. - Who were the baddies, okay."
00:27:39,00:27:42,- Just a quite a nice link between her past
00:27:42,00:27:44,"and her sort of future,"
00:27:44,00:27:47,if you're placing yourself in 1940.
00:27:47,00:27:48,"It goes back to this fact,"
00:27:48,00:27:49,"James' fact at the start of the show,"
00:27:49,00:27:51,so when communism fell.
00:27:51,00:27:53,"So basically, she never liked references"
00:27:53,00:27:55,"to her history as a child star, you know."
00:27:55,00:27:57,She would say it's not for everyone.
00:27:57,00:27:57,Everyone was a child.
00:27:57,00:27:59,"How come I'm the only one who,"
00:27:59,00:28:02,"as a very high achieving diplomat and politician,"
00:28:02,00:28:05,"you know, gets labeled as former child star?"
00:28:05,00:28:06,"- Well, not everyone."
00:28:06,00:28:09,"Like, that kind of havel wasn't in movies."
00:28:09,00:28:12,- We don't know.
00:28:12,00:28:14,There might have been some obscured Czech films
00:28:14,00:28:18,undiscovered with him spouting philosophy age nine.
00:28:18,00:28:20,But she did give them a treat just once.
00:28:20,00:28:23,"So it was when communism did fall in Czechoslovakia,"
00:28:23,00:28:24,"big day, very exciting."
00:28:24,00:28:26,"She called all of her senior staff together,"
00:28:26,00:28:28,"shut the doors, very private room,"
00:28:28,00:28:30,and apparently looked them very sternly in the eye
00:28:30,00:28:33,"and said, ""I'm only going to do this once."""
00:28:33,00:28:34,And then she started prancing around the room
00:28:34,00:28:35,and singing on the good chip lot.
00:28:35,00:28:37,(all laughing)
00:28:37,00:28:39,- That's amazing. - It's awesome.
00:28:39,00:28:42,- I've just got one thing on child stars
00:28:42,00:28:44,"and how to become a child star, because--"
00:28:44,00:28:45,- A bit late for us.
00:28:45,00:28:46,"- A bit late for us, but you know,"
00:28:46,00:28:48,"I've got a kid on the way,"
00:28:48,00:28:50,"so I could actually get going on this,"
00:28:50,00:28:53,"which is there's a company called Jam 2000,"
00:28:53,00:28:55,"and they're the agency that basically,"
00:28:55,00:28:57,when you see a baby in the UK on TV
00:28:57,00:28:59,"and call the midwife, even the crown or Sherlock,"
00:28:59,00:29:01,"if there's a baby in it,"
00:29:01,00:29:03,it's a good chance that Jam 2000 gave them.
00:29:03,00:29:05,"So when the baby is born,"
00:29:05,00:29:07,the baby can get an acting license
00:29:07,00:29:09,within a few hours of being born.
00:29:09,00:29:11,"In America, it takes about 15 days."
00:29:11,00:29:13,You've got to be 15 days old to get a worker's permit
00:29:13,00:29:14,"or acting. - How do you,"
00:29:14,00:29:16,do you need to audition?
00:29:16,00:29:18,"Like, when you're coming out of the birth canal,"
00:29:18,00:29:20,"you're like, ""Mary, come lie down."""
00:29:20,00:29:21,- Exactly.
00:29:21,00:29:22,So that's the issue.
00:29:22,00:29:23,"They say that often people complain,"
00:29:23,00:29:25,"like, ""This baby's crying all the time."""
00:29:25,00:29:26,"They say, ""Well, you just happened to have"
00:29:26,00:29:27,"been given a crying baby."""
00:29:27,00:29:29,"Unfortunately, that's the case."
00:29:29,00:29:31,"But they do have specifications that they like,"
00:29:31,00:29:35,"so triplets or twins are particularly liked,"
00:29:35,00:29:37,"because twins, most likely,"
00:29:37,00:29:39,you're gonna be born three weeks early.
00:29:39,00:29:42,"Triplets, in some cases, seven weeks early, right?"
00:29:42,00:29:43,- Is that good?
00:29:43,00:29:44,- It's good. - I guess they'll be extra small
00:29:44,00:29:46,'cause they can get older and they can look newborn.
00:29:46,00:29:47,- Exactly.
00:29:47,00:29:49,- I actually thought it would be that
00:29:49,00:29:51,they would only have to work for 20 minutes at a time
00:29:51,00:29:52,'cause you can keep swapping them in and out.
00:29:52,00:29:54,- That's the other reason.
00:29:54,00:29:55,"So when they're looking for tiny babies,"
00:29:55,00:29:56,twins are fantastic.
00:29:56,00:29:58,"They're tiny, but you can do double time"
00:29:58,00:30:00,because you've got two babies to swap in there.
00:30:00,00:30:02,"- Oh, babies look almost identical anyway."
00:30:02,00:30:03,"- So you would think so, right?"
00:30:03,00:30:06,"But sometimes it's to do with hair and sometimes to do,"
00:30:06,00:30:08,"but yeah, so the youngest that this company said"
00:30:08,00:30:11,that they've ever handed over as a four-day-old baby
00:30:11,00:30:12,in order to be used.
00:30:12,00:30:13,- Amazing.
00:30:13,00:30:14,- And so it's a great article
00:30:14,00:30:16,where it just tells you about different types
00:30:16,00:30:18,babies have been using and just a little nugget
00:30:18,00:30:19,for any Star Wars fans out there.
00:30:19,00:30:21,"In Star Wars Revenge of the Sith,"
00:30:21,00:30:24,"we get to see Luke and Leia, who are twins that are born."
00:30:24,00:30:26,"- Wait, that's episode three."
00:30:26,00:30:27,"- Three, yeah."
00:30:27,00:30:29,- So you get to see them as babies
00:30:29,00:30:31,and that's where you learn that their brother and sister
00:30:31,00:30:35,in the series and the babies that were used for that
00:30:35,00:30:39,"were actually one, which was a guy called Aidan Barton."
00:30:39,00:30:41,He plays both Luke and Leia.
00:30:41,00:30:42,- Really?
00:30:42,00:30:43,- So when you look at them--
00:30:43,00:30:45,"- He's like, ""Alex Guinness in kind hearts and coronets."""
00:30:45,00:30:46,(laughing)
00:30:46,00:30:49,"- Yeah, he's Eddie Murphy and then meet--"
00:30:49,00:30:50,- What a reference to you to make James.
00:30:50,00:30:52,From somebody who hasn't seen any films made before
00:30:52,00:30:54,"about 1987, for you to make a kind hearts and coronets"
00:30:54,00:30:56,"reference, what have you done with James?"
00:30:56,00:30:58,- That's just somebody who does a lot of quizzes.
00:30:58,00:31:00,(laughing)
00:31:00,00:31:02,"Sorry, yeah, I've not seen Star Wars."
00:31:02,00:31:03,What are you talking about?
00:31:03,00:31:04,- So-- - Twins.
00:31:04,00:31:05,"- Also, can I, can I, quick, quick, sorry."
00:31:05,00:31:06,"- No, no, no, no, I know what you're gonna say"
00:31:06,00:31:08,and don't say it because we're going--
00:31:08,00:31:09,- The point of which you find out in the series
00:31:09,00:31:10,that Luke and Leia are siblings.
00:31:10,00:31:13,"- Yeah, if you start at episode one like a psychopath."
00:31:13,00:31:14,"- James, where would you start?"
00:31:14,00:31:15,- One.
00:31:15,00:31:15,- There we go.
00:31:15,00:31:16,When's he gonna find out?
00:31:16,00:31:18,"- Come on, you've asked James the only person"
00:31:18,00:31:20,who doesn't know when to start watching Star Wars
00:31:20,00:31:22,and I think that's an unfair sample.
00:31:22,00:31:24,"- It's the first episode, there's a second episode"
00:31:24,00:31:25,that you find out.
00:31:25,00:31:26,"- Presumably, they wouldn't have called"
00:31:26,00:31:27,"them episode one, two, and three"
00:31:27,00:31:29,"if they didn't want you to watch them first, would they?"
00:31:29,00:31:31,"- Absolutely, no, no, no."
00:31:31,00:31:32,- It's absolutely correct.
00:31:32,00:31:33,Jabba the Hutt was actually played
00:31:33,00:31:36,by a six-week-old baby on that episode.
00:31:36,00:31:38,Very overfed.
00:31:38,00:31:40,(upbeat music)
00:31:40,00:31:45,"Okay, it is time for fact number three"
00:31:45,00:31:46,and that is my fact.
00:31:46,00:31:49,My fact this week is that there used to be a cinema
00:31:49,00:31:51,"in Melbourne, Australia that had a cloakroom"
00:31:51,00:31:53,to keep your babies in.
00:31:53,00:31:54,(laughing)
00:31:54,00:31:55,What?
00:31:55,00:31:58,So this was called the Sun Theater
00:31:58,00:32:00,and this was a place where when you were arriving
00:32:00,00:32:02,"at the cinema, you would have a cloakroom"
00:32:02,00:32:03,"but rather than leaving your coat in there,"
00:32:03,00:32:06,"you would push your baby in its pram into the cloakroom,"
00:32:06,00:32:09,"be given a ticket, and then go watch the movie."
00:32:09,00:32:11,"Now, obviously you don't want to completely abandon"
00:32:11,00:32:13,"your baby, so while you're watching the movie,"
00:32:13,00:32:15,if your baby in the cloakroom kicks off
00:32:15,00:32:17,"and starts crying inconsolably,"
00:32:17,00:32:20,the ticket number that you hold will flash up
00:32:20,00:32:22,on the screen of the movie to let you know
00:32:22,00:32:24,that you're desperately needed in the cloakroom
00:32:24,00:32:26,so you can get out and look after your baby.
00:32:26,00:32:26,- It's very clever.
00:32:26,00:32:27,- Brilliant.
00:32:27,00:32:29,"- Hang on, would it flash up for all the other members"
00:32:29,00:32:30,of the audience?
00:32:30,00:32:32,Is it gonna replace the image that was on the screen
00:32:32,00:32:34,or is it a little thing in the corner that's subtle?
00:32:34,00:32:36,"- Like, I think just a quick superimpose"
00:32:36,00:32:37,"at the number 29, whatever."
00:32:37,00:32:39,"- Really, on the screen, mid-film?"
00:32:39,00:32:39,- I think that would be all right.
00:32:39,00:32:41,"- But be mid-film, I don't know if it would be"
00:32:41,00:32:43,"directly over the whole thing, it might be in the corner."
00:32:43,00:32:44,I couldn't actually find that out.
00:32:44,00:32:46,- It's a must-be corner.
00:32:46,00:32:47,- I don't know.
00:32:47,00:32:48,- I'll be so annoying 'cause babies cry constantly
00:32:48,00:32:51,and if you've got 50 babies at a big blockbuster film
00:32:51,00:32:53,"in the cloakroom, you're just gonna be watching a series"
00:32:53,00:32:55,of numbers flashing up in the national lottery.
00:32:55,00:32:56,- Exactly.
00:32:56,00:32:57,(laughing)
00:32:57,00:32:58,- So this--
00:32:58,00:32:58,- It's ingenious.
00:32:58,00:33:00,- It was a very clever idea and this was--
00:33:00,00:33:01,- Why do we not have it today?
00:33:01,00:33:02,"- Exactly, why don't we?"
00:33:02,00:33:03,It seems like a very--
00:33:03,00:33:05,- 'Cause people don't think they should just leave their babies.
00:33:05,00:33:06,"- Yeah, I don't think I'd leave my baby now"
00:33:06,00:33:08,that I say that out loud.
00:33:08,00:33:10,"- Well, your baby's probably in the movie."
00:33:10,00:33:12,"- That's right, it's in the movie, yeah."
00:33:12,00:33:14,"Well, you do have baby cinema now,"
00:33:14,00:33:15,which we take my son to go and see.
00:33:15,00:33:16,"- Yeah, I got to that."
00:33:16,00:33:17,"- Yeah, we took--"
00:33:17,00:33:19,- You really should take your child along sometimes.
00:33:19,00:33:21,"- I know, I know."
00:33:21,00:33:23,"- The first movie that we took, ""Wilf"" to see,"
00:33:23,00:33:25,"Fenella, my wife took ""Wilf"" to see was the movie"
00:33:25,00:33:27,that was on the biopic of Churchill
00:33:27,00:33:29,that came out about four years back.
00:33:29,00:33:31,- So all the babies look like Churchill.
00:33:31,00:33:33,"- Like ""Wilf"" was really into it"
00:33:33,00:33:35,"'cause he was like, ""Wow, it's me in a suit when I'm older."""
00:33:35,00:33:37,This is amazing.
00:33:37,00:33:41,So the Sun Theater had opened up in Melbourne in 1938
00:33:41,00:33:42,and it was a single screen theater.
00:33:42,00:33:46,"It had 1,050 seats and it was really massive."
00:33:46,00:33:48,"It was a big deal and then over time,"
00:33:48,00:33:51,people stopped going as much and they had to sell
00:33:51,00:33:54,and new owners turned it into smaller screens.
00:33:54,00:33:55,So they stopped doing it.
00:33:55,00:33:58,"It's no longer a, you don't bring your Pram in there anymore,"
00:33:58,00:34:00,which is a shame.
00:34:00,00:34:02,- And I can't find any other cinema that did this.
00:34:02,00:34:05,"- No, no, yeah. - I think it was just this one."
00:34:05,00:34:08,- There are people who've left their children
00:34:08,00:34:09,in cloak rooms before.
00:34:09,00:34:11,"I won't go so far as to say, ""This is a thing,"""
00:34:11,00:34:13,because it's not.
00:34:13,00:34:15,"But in 1999, Tony Blair's chief of staff"
00:34:15,00:34:17,was a guy called Jonathan Powell and--
00:34:17,00:34:19,"- Oh, I remember Powell."
00:34:19,00:34:20,"Oh, those are the good old days, weren't they?"
00:34:20,00:34:21,- Friend of Anna.
00:34:21,00:34:24,"Anyway, he went to the Groucho Club"
00:34:24,00:34:26,and left his eight-week-old daughter
00:34:26,00:34:28,with a cloakroom attendant and that was--
00:34:28,00:34:30,And there was a brief comment about it
00:34:30,00:34:32,"and then the family complained saying,"
00:34:32,00:34:33,"""The child has a right to a private life,"""
00:34:33,00:34:34,"and I think the newspaper said,"
00:34:34,00:34:36,"""Well, don't leave the child in the cloakroom then."""
00:34:36,00:34:39,"Anyway, but the Observer sent a reporter"
00:34:39,00:34:41,"called Saskia Sessons, who took a colleague of hers,"
00:34:41,00:34:45,"five-month-old baby, to various cloakrooms all over London."
00:34:45,00:34:47,It's a great feature.
00:34:47,00:34:49,So King's Cross left luggage office?
00:34:49,00:34:50,Absolutely not.
00:34:50,00:34:51,The Ivy Restaurant?
00:34:51,00:34:54,"Yes, please leave the baby with us."
00:34:54,00:34:55,We'll stash him on a ledge.
00:34:55,00:34:58,National Gallery were incredibly rude to Saskia
00:34:58,00:35:00,and her young friend.
00:35:00,00:35:02,"One of the cloakroom attendants said,"
00:35:02,00:35:03,"""Out of the question."""
00:35:03,00:35:05,"The second said, ""You need your head examined,"""
00:35:05,00:35:07,"and the third said, ""That's very, very irresponsible."""
00:35:07,00:35:08,"- Get on, yeah. - I know."
00:35:08,00:35:10,"- So, wait a minute, that was all in the same--"
00:35:10,00:35:11,- That was all so close.
00:35:11,00:35:13,"- She keeps saying, ""I want a second opinion."""
00:35:13,00:35:15,"""I want a third opinion."""
00:35:15,00:35:16,- But restaurants seemed to be much more willing.
00:35:16,00:35:19,"The Oxo Tower Brasserie, which is a restaurant in London,"
00:35:19,00:35:21,"said, ""Yes, of course, please leave the baby with us."""
00:35:21,00:35:23,"- I guess restaurants are smaller,"
00:35:23,00:35:25,"so you can go to the parent if there's an issue,"
00:35:25,00:35:26,whereas National Gallery feel like
00:35:26,00:35:27,"you can lose the parent, right?"
00:35:27,00:35:29,"- That's true, yeah."
00:35:29,00:35:31,- One famous person left in the cloakroom
00:35:31,00:35:34,"is a character from Importance of Being Earnest,"
00:35:34,00:35:37,left in a handbag in the station.
00:35:37,00:35:41,So I thought I'd look into that play by Oscar Wilde.
00:35:41,00:35:44,"Yeah, so Oscar Wilde famously,"
00:35:44,00:35:48,could you tell I can't find anything else about cloakrooms?
00:35:48,00:35:53,"So he was famously brought up with charges of immorality,"
00:35:53,00:35:55,"wasn't he, because he was homosexual."
00:35:55,00:35:57,"And in 1952, there was a movie,"
00:35:57,00:35:59,"the first movie made of the Importance of Being Earnest,"
00:35:59,00:36:03,and it was directed by a guy called Anthony Asquith.
00:36:03,00:36:06,"And Anthony Asquith was the son of Herbert Henry Asquith,"
00:36:06,00:36:08,"who was home secretary,"
00:36:08,00:36:11,and he was the one who brought the charges of immorality
00:36:11,00:36:12,"against Oscar Wilde,"
00:36:12,00:36:14,which got him imprisoned in Reading jail.
00:36:14,00:36:15,- That's interesting.
00:36:15,00:36:17,"- Yeah, and so he was the one who got him imprisoned,"
00:36:17,00:36:20,and then his son was the director of the movie.
00:36:20,00:36:21,- That's really good.
00:36:21,00:36:22,- You look great full circle.
00:36:22,00:36:25,- I found some famous people who worked in cloakrooms.
00:36:25,00:36:25,"- Oh yeah, cool."
00:36:25,00:36:27,- Mark Ormond.
00:36:27,00:36:28,"- Oh, from Soft Cell."
00:36:28,00:36:29,- Soft Cell.
00:36:29,00:36:31,- Of Tainted Love fame.
00:36:31,00:36:32,"- Can I just ask, is that the most famous,"
00:36:32,00:36:33,and you're going to less and less?
00:36:33,00:36:34,"'Cause I haven't heard of him,"
00:36:34,00:36:36,I'm gonna scratch off the dress.
00:36:36,00:36:37,"- Don't worry, I actually,"
00:36:37,00:36:39,I started with my weakest one.
00:36:39,00:36:40,"- Okay, great."
00:36:40,00:36:40,"- Yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:36:40,00:36:42,Where did he work in the cloakroom?
00:36:42,00:36:43,"Sorry, did you solve?"
00:36:43,00:36:45,"- Probably at the front bit, where you take his clothes."
00:36:45,00:36:47,- So he was high up in the role.
00:36:47,00:36:49,"- I didn't write it down, I'm sorry."
00:36:49,00:36:50,- Silla Black.
00:36:50,00:36:51,- Yeah.
00:36:51,00:36:53,- The cloakroom attendant at the cavern club.
00:36:53,00:36:54,- Who else is on your list?
00:36:54,00:36:55,- Boy George.
00:36:55,00:36:56,"- Boy George, yeah."
00:36:56,00:36:57,"- He, um."
00:36:57,00:36:58,"- At the culture club, wasn't it?"
00:36:58,00:36:59,(laughing)
00:36:59,00:37:01,"- Good, sorry."
00:37:01,00:37:02,That's the band that Boy George was in.
00:37:02,00:37:04,"- Thank you, didn't get it yet."
00:37:04,00:37:06,"- Yeah, and Boy George is a singer in the band."
00:37:06,00:37:07,"- Yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:37:07,00:37:09,"- Cool, I don't want to ruin every joke by asking,"
00:37:09,00:37:10,so sometimes I'll just stay quiet and let it happen.
00:37:10,00:37:12,- Karma Chameleon was the big hit.
00:37:12,00:37:14,- That didn't help the joke.
00:37:14,00:37:16,"- No, just I'm just helping Anna understand who this is."
00:37:16,00:37:17,- Good to learn.
00:37:17,00:37:18,"- He was interviewed about it later,"
00:37:18,00:37:20,"and he said, ""I was always rippling through pockets"
00:37:20,00:37:23,"""and handbags, most people were too pissed to notice."""
00:37:23,00:37:24,"- Oh, yeah."
00:37:24,00:37:25,- Any babies in the handbags?
00:37:25,00:37:27,- He didn't find the people.
00:37:27,00:37:28,"- Riffling, hey?"
00:37:28,00:37:29,"- In my notes, I've got riffing,"
00:37:29,00:37:31,but that can't possibly be true.
00:37:31,00:37:33,"- No, I just would always say rifling."
00:37:33,00:37:35,"- That's better, then that is correct, yep."
00:37:35,00:37:37,"Sorry, yeah."
00:37:37,00:37:38,- On cloakrooms.
00:37:38,00:37:40,"- Oh, yeah."
00:37:40,00:37:42,"- I read, so I think we've talked before about"
00:37:42,00:37:46,"how popcorn wasn't really loud in cinemas until the third,"
00:37:46,00:37:48,"and it was sort of post-depression, I think,"
00:37:48,00:37:49,when everyone was so depressed.
00:37:49,00:37:51,"They were like, ""Let us have the popcorn."""
00:37:51,00:37:54,"And also, yeah, the cinemas filled that."
00:37:54,00:37:55,- They thought people would tread it
00:37:55,00:37:57,"into the nice carpets, didn't they?"
00:37:57,00:37:58,"- Well, before that, exactly."
00:37:58,00:37:59,They thought people would tread it into the carpets.
00:37:59,00:38:00,"It was too noisy,"
00:38:00,00:38:02,and so you used to have to leave your popcorn in the cloakroom
00:38:02,00:38:06,"'cause people set up popcorn stands all outside cinemas,"
00:38:06,00:38:07,"and they sell it to you, leaving the cloakroom."
00:38:07,00:38:10,"- That's amazing, just hand it in like a gun or something,"
00:38:10,00:38:12,and then you get it back afterwards.
00:38:12,00:38:14,- You take a gun to the cinema?
00:38:14,00:38:16,"- No, sorry, I'm thinking of the thing in Old West."
00:38:16,00:38:17,- Every time someone looks at their phone
00:38:17,00:38:18,in the middle of a movie.
00:38:18,00:38:21,(laughing)
00:38:21,00:38:23,- You got in a lot of trouble in your tour
00:38:23,00:38:25,"of some national gallery clothes, didn't you?"
00:38:25,00:38:27,Keep my AK-47.
00:38:27,00:38:29,- Wasn't there a thing where you had to hand in your gun
00:38:29,00:38:31,when you went to a Wild West bar?
00:38:31,00:38:33,"- Towns, like most of the Wild West towns"
00:38:33,00:38:35,"wouldn't allow guns inside,"
00:38:35,00:38:37,"so they would have a way to sort of stop, you know?"
00:38:37,00:38:38,- I think that's where--
00:38:38,00:38:40,- Often you had them taken at the periphery
00:38:40,00:38:41,of what we've talked about.
00:38:41,00:38:44,"- In fact, I think we said that in the OK Corral,"
00:38:44,00:38:45,problem was the reason it happened
00:38:45,00:38:46,is 'cause they hadn't put their guns
00:38:46,00:38:48,in the cloakroom before they arrived.
00:38:48,00:38:50,"- Exactly, that's what I'm thinking of."
00:38:50,00:38:52,"That's my incredibly convoluted part of that, you know?"
00:38:52,00:38:54,"- Actually, speaking of weapons in cloakrooms,"
00:38:54,00:38:57,tell me something famous about the Houses of Parliament.
00:38:57,00:38:59,"- Oh yeah, the swords in the cloakroom."
00:38:59,00:39:01,You've got a place for your swords.
00:39:01,00:39:03,- There are hooks in the cloakroom
00:39:03,00:39:05,so you can hang up your sword.
00:39:05,00:39:07,"- Yep, absolutely."
00:39:07,00:39:09,"If you go into the Houses of Parliament cloakrooms,"
00:39:09,00:39:12,"all the coat hangers have a loop of pink ribbon around them,"
00:39:12,00:39:15,and that is for holding your sword.
00:39:15,00:39:17,So you're not allowed to sword in the chamber.
00:39:17,00:39:22,"And I read a good expose of the fact that this,"
00:39:22,00:39:23,"there's no evidence, this is true."
00:39:23,00:39:25,So various reasons.
00:39:25,00:39:28,"So in the massive fire in the 1830s,"
00:39:28,00:39:29,"when everything was destroyed,"
00:39:29,00:39:32,that was way after anyone would ever bring swords in.
00:39:32,00:39:35,And so it's weird that they would have the sword hooks.
00:39:35,00:39:36,"But even if they were for swords,"
00:39:36,00:39:38,"the first mention that they were was 1928,"
00:39:38,00:39:40,"and it was like an MP saying,"
00:39:40,00:39:41,"""Hey, they've got ribbons there."""
00:39:41,00:39:43,And that's from the olden days 'cause of the sword thing.
00:39:43,00:39:45,"And actually, all the mentions before that"
00:39:45,00:39:48,say they were for a much more sensible item.
00:39:48,00:39:49,- Umbrella's.
00:39:49,00:39:51,- Umbrella's.
00:39:51,00:39:52,There you go.
00:39:52,00:39:55,- I've got a bit of Australian cinema news
00:39:55,00:39:58,just while we were talking about Aussie cinemas.
00:39:58,00:40:01,Australia's longest running pornographic cinema
00:40:01,00:40:03,is finally going to shut down.
00:40:03,00:40:04,"And according to the article,"
00:40:04,00:40:06,it's called the Crazy Horse Cinema.
00:40:06,00:40:07,"And according to the article,"
00:40:07,00:40:09,dozens of 90 year old pensioners
00:40:09,00:40:11,are gonna be absolutely distraught
00:40:11,00:40:13,'cause it's their meeting place.
00:40:13,00:40:16,- There's a big group of 90.
00:40:16,00:40:18,- What did she say?
00:40:18,00:40:20,What's she doing?
00:40:20,00:40:21,She's gonna get a cold.
00:40:21,00:40:24,He's not a real plumber.
00:40:24,00:40:26,"Sorry, what?"
00:40:26,00:40:29,"- Yeah, this place has been open for many years."
00:40:29,00:40:32,And supposedly it's a really good meeting ground
00:40:32,00:40:34,for a lot of these 90 year old pensioners.
00:40:34,00:40:36,So they all meet up there at 10 a.m.
00:40:36,00:40:39,- Very early to start.
00:40:39,00:40:41,- Very early.
00:40:41,00:40:43,This comes from a quote from the lady.
00:40:43,00:40:45,They come and they do their thing in the morning.
00:40:45,00:40:46,- Disgusting.
00:40:46,00:40:48,(laughing)
00:40:48,00:40:51,They come and then they have their meeting.
00:40:51,00:40:53,"- Yeah, they could come and do their thing in the morning,"
00:40:53,00:40:54,whatever that is they do.
00:40:54,00:40:56,And then they go and maybe do some shopping for the wife
00:40:56,00:40:57,and maybe have some lunch
00:40:57,00:40:58,and then come back if they like.
00:40:58,00:40:59,What they get is--
00:40:59,00:41:00,"- Oh, they sell mail pensioners."
00:41:00,00:41:01,- It's mail pensioners
00:41:01,00:41:04,and they get a $10 pensioner all day ticket
00:41:04,00:41:06,to the porno cinema.
00:41:06,00:41:07,- What?
00:41:07,00:41:08,"So sorry, when they're having this meeting,"
00:41:08,00:41:09,is it in the cinema?
00:41:09,00:41:10,"Why won't you film? - It's not really a meeting, is it?"
00:41:10,00:41:12,It's sort of like a gathering.
00:41:12,00:41:13,"- I even think as a teenager,"
00:41:13,00:41:15,I would be able to get my money's worth
00:41:15,00:41:18,from an old day ticket on a graphic cinema.
00:41:18,00:41:19,(laughing)
00:41:19,00:41:19,It's a pensioner.
00:41:19,00:41:21,- For angry sales in Australia.
00:41:21,00:41:24,(laughing)
00:41:24,00:41:24,- That's so funny.
00:41:24,00:41:26,"- Yeah, so these guys, these nine-year-olds"
00:41:26,00:41:27,have been going for 20 years.
00:41:27,00:41:31,"So, you know, they were a fruity, fresh 70-year-olds"
00:41:31,00:41:32,at the time.
00:41:32,00:41:35,"And yeah, and then obviously--"
00:41:35,00:41:36,- These lads are gonna be thrilled
00:41:36,00:41:38,when they find out about the internet.
00:41:38,00:41:40,(laughing)
00:41:41,00:41:44,"- Yeah, that's, you know, so they're distraught"
00:41:44,00:41:45,at the moment.
00:41:45,00:41:46,And it's closing this year.
00:41:46,00:41:47,"This is from this year, this article."
00:41:47,00:41:50,"- Good, but crazy, the crazy boys."
00:41:50,00:41:53,"- Knock it down, so the ground with salt."
00:41:53,00:41:54,- I don't know.
00:41:54,00:41:55,"It keeps them out for the full day,"
00:41:55,00:41:56,which is judging by the sounds of these men.
00:41:56,00:41:57,Sounds like some of the boys.
00:41:57,00:41:58,"- That's the poor idea, yeah."
00:41:58,00:41:59,- Yeah.
00:41:59,00:42:00,- Is popcorn allowed?
00:42:00,00:42:01,"- Um, as a matter of the cup,"
00:42:01,00:42:02,"it's got bigger concerns, actually."
00:42:02,00:42:03,(laughing)
00:42:03,00:42:06,(upbeat music)
00:42:09,00:42:12,"- Okay, it is time for our final fact of the show,"
00:42:12,00:42:14,and that is Anna.
00:42:14,00:42:17,- My fact this week is that the original vapes
00:42:17,00:42:19,were Pez dispensers.
00:42:19,00:42:21,(laughing)
00:42:21,00:42:24,"So, you know, for people in the UK who maybe don't,"
00:42:24,00:42:27,Pez dispensers are like those sweet holders.
00:42:27,00:42:29,"They're a huge deal in America, right?"
00:42:29,00:42:31,"They're kind of tubes that hold sweets,"
00:42:31,00:42:32,and they have a funny head on top.
00:42:32,00:42:33,"- Well, yeah, so you got a little funny head,"
00:42:33,00:42:35,"and you tip the head back,"
00:42:35,00:42:39,and it's like an elevator system where the latest sweet
00:42:39,00:42:41,"that's sitting on top arrives at the top,"
00:42:41,00:42:43,"bing, and you get to pull it out,"
00:42:43,00:42:46,and it's a little rectangular sweetie.
00:42:46,00:42:47,"- Like a brick, but much smaller."
00:42:47,00:42:49,"- Exactly, like a tiny brick built."
00:42:49,00:42:51,"- Yeah, if you were building a house for an else."
00:42:51,00:42:53,"- Imagine if you were building a house,"
00:42:53,00:42:54,"but you had an elevator,"
00:42:54,00:42:56,"and every time you needed to put a brick on,"
00:42:56,00:42:58,the brick had to come up in an elevator.
00:42:58,00:42:59,- Yeah.
00:42:59,00:42:59,- And then it would come out.
00:42:59,00:43:01,"- Well, this is a classically helpful,"
00:43:01,00:43:03,no such thing as a fishing explainer.
00:43:03,00:43:04,"- The lucky thing is,"
00:43:04,00:43:06,"everyone knows one of Pez,"
00:43:06,00:43:07,(all laughing)
00:43:07,00:43:08,- That was a waste of your time in ours.
00:43:08,00:43:11,"- Yeah, it's, yeah, and you,"
00:43:11,00:43:13,"- Are you gonna, so you're gonna try as well now?"
00:43:13,00:43:16,"- I think of them as kind of confectionary staplers,"
00:43:16,00:43:18,"'cause you have to load it in cartilage with sweets,"
00:43:18,00:43:19,"don't you, and you like some staples."
00:43:19,00:43:22,- That's actually the best simile that we've had so far.
00:43:22,00:43:23,"- That was actually really good, yeah."
00:43:23,00:43:24,- We'll allow it.
00:43:24,00:43:28,"Anyway, Pez sweets were created in 1927 in Vienna."
00:43:28,00:43:30,- And people smoke them.
00:43:30,00:43:33,- And people load them into their cigarettes.
00:43:33,00:43:34,"No, but they were created"
00:43:34,00:43:36,"by a guy called Edward Haas III,"
00:43:36,00:43:38,"and he was an anti-smoking campaigner,"
00:43:38,00:43:39,"thought it was bad for your health,"
00:43:39,00:43:41,"well done, very forward-thinking of him,"
00:43:41,00:43:43,and he wanted to create a tablet
00:43:43,00:43:47,that helped people to cut down on smoking or overeating.
00:43:47,00:43:49,"And so they were these mint tablets,"
00:43:49,00:43:51,and that was what they were explicitly for.
00:43:51,00:43:55,"Early advert said, ""No smoking, pezzing allowed."""
00:43:55,00:43:56,Like vaping.
00:43:56,00:43:59,"And then when the dispensers came about in the '50s,"
00:43:59,00:44:01,"they are sort of, well, the first ones were shaped"
00:44:01,00:44:03,"so like really like cigarette lighters,"
00:44:03,00:44:07,"and they were for adults, marketed very much for adults."
00:44:07,00:44:09,- And they used to send women in sort of like
00:44:09,00:44:13,quite cleavage-heavy dresses around in vans.
00:44:13,00:44:14,- Cleavage-heavy.
00:44:14,00:44:15,"- Low putts, we call them."
00:44:15,00:44:17,"- Yeah, cleavage-heavy, not all right."
00:44:17,00:44:19,I guess we're wearing a very cleavage-heavy top tonight.
00:44:19,00:44:21,It's a cut.
00:44:21,00:44:24,"Your saucy fashion show, the descriptions are not good."
00:44:24,00:44:28,"- They said they do look a bit like lighters,"
00:44:28,00:44:30,"but according to Sean Peterson,"
00:44:30,00:44:33,"who's the historian at Pez Candy, incorporated,"
00:44:33,00:44:36,they were only designed that way to fit into pockets.
00:44:36,00:44:38,It's just a coincidence that they look like lighters
00:44:38,00:44:40,'cause lighters are also designed to go into pockets.
00:44:40,00:44:43,"- Yeah, I did hear that Pez Candy,"
00:44:43,00:44:46,"incorporated does have an official historian, I thought."
00:44:46,00:44:46,- Sean Peterson.
00:44:46,00:44:50,"- It's a very light historian gig,"
00:44:50,00:44:52,"as in it's a very, very small area of history."
00:44:52,00:44:54,- I reckon he does other stuff.
00:44:54,00:44:55,- You'd have to.
00:44:55,00:44:57,- I think usually the historians in these kind of companies
00:44:57,00:44:59,"are actually someone who does another job,"
00:44:59,00:45:01,"but in their spare time, they kind of--"
00:45:01,00:45:02,"- I'm sure you're right,"
00:45:02,00:45:03,because otherwise you'd feel like a fool
00:45:03,00:45:05,turning up at a historian's conference.
00:45:05,00:45:06,"They'd be like, ""What do you study?"""
00:45:06,00:45:08,"""Oh, the 19th century mostly, what about you?"""
00:45:08,00:45:09,(laughing)
00:45:09,00:45:11,- You sat next to Mary Beard on one side
00:45:11,00:45:13,and Dan Snow on the other side.
00:45:13,00:45:16,(laughing)
00:45:16,00:45:18,"- But yeah, it was until they came to America"
00:45:18,00:45:20,"that they still, even when the dispensers were added,"
00:45:20,00:45:22,this was a way to give up smoking.
00:45:22,00:45:24,And apparently it was only when they went to America
00:45:24,00:45:26,in the '50s and tried to market them there
00:45:26,00:45:27,"and they were targeting adults,"
00:45:27,00:45:29,kids how to quit smoking.
00:45:29,00:45:31,America didn't have the same appetite to quit smoking.
00:45:31,00:45:32,I think maybe there wasn't such a campaign back then
00:45:32,00:45:35,"as there was in Austria, saying this is bad."
00:45:35,00:45:38,"And so they thought, let's start putting fun,"
00:45:38,00:45:39,turning them into fun kid shapes
00:45:39,00:45:40,and marketing them to children.
00:45:40,00:45:42,"- Yeah, and changing the taste, obviously,"
00:45:42,00:45:45,of the thing from a sort of anti-smoking nicotine--
00:45:45,00:45:47,"- Well, they wasn't just peppermint."
00:45:47,00:45:49,"- No, no, but as in they changed it to sweeties."
00:45:49,00:45:50,They made this.
00:45:50,00:45:51,- But they were always minty.
00:45:51,00:45:53,- They were always minty on the start.
00:45:53,00:45:54,- 'Cause that's where the name comes from.
00:45:54,00:45:56,It comes from the German for peppermint.
00:45:56,00:45:56,"- Oh, yeah."
00:45:56,00:46:00,"- Weirdly, one of the first flavors they had was chlorophyll."
00:46:00,00:46:01,- Yeah.
00:46:01,00:46:02,- What?
00:46:02,00:46:02,- So what is that?
00:46:02,00:46:04,- It's the green stuff you get in leaves.
00:46:04,00:46:06,- It's hard to know what it tastes like.
00:46:06,00:46:07,- Exactly.
00:46:07,00:46:08,- I've never thought of it as anything.
00:46:08,00:46:09,"- It tastes like grass, I reckon."
00:46:09,00:46:12,"- I would imagine so too, but it's such a weird flavor."
00:46:12,00:46:15,"Can we talk about Edouard Haas, the third?"
00:46:15,00:46:16,"- Haas, yes."
00:46:16,00:46:17,"- So it's a really interesting family,"
00:46:17,00:46:21,"because his father, Edward Haas the second,"
00:46:21,00:46:23,was a baked goods merchant.
00:46:23,00:46:24,"Okay, so it's all baking powder."
00:46:24,00:46:27,"And his father, Edward Haas--"
00:46:27,00:46:28,"- It's not actually a baked good, is it?"
00:46:28,00:46:30,- It's a good for baking.
00:46:30,00:46:31,"- What a good point, it's a baking goods."
00:46:31,00:46:33,"Yeah, yeah, sorry, I stand corrected."
00:46:33,00:46:38,"Okay, but basically, Edward the third"
00:46:38,00:46:41,seems to have invented the first ready-made cake mixture.
00:46:41,00:46:41,It's a huge deal.
00:46:41,00:46:44,"- So wait a minute, was this the one who did Paz,"
00:46:44,00:46:45,or is this--
00:46:45,00:46:46,"- The one who did Paz, the third, yeah."
00:46:46,00:46:48,Edward the third is the guy who did Hassan
00:46:48,00:46:50,for the baking of health sponge cakes.
00:46:50,00:46:55,"Edward's grandfather, Edward Haas the first, okay."
00:46:55,00:46:56,I've read one reference to this.
00:46:56,00:46:58,"""I cannot find any more detail anywhere,"
00:46:58,00:47:01,"""but there's a source online which claims that he died"
00:47:01,00:47:04,"""as a result of medical experiments he did on himself."""
00:47:04,00:47:07,There's no further evidence that I found.
00:47:07,00:47:10,"So if you know, please write in and enlighten us,"
00:47:10,00:47:15,because it's not clear what he was doing to himself.
00:47:15,00:47:17,"- They're in the baking industry, what could he have done?"
00:47:17,00:47:20,He added too much bicarbonate soda to himself.
00:47:20,00:47:21,"- He wanted to know how hot to bake things,"
00:47:21,00:47:23,so he tested the temperature himself.
00:47:23,00:47:24,- Sat in the oven.
00:47:24,00:47:25,"- Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:47:25,00:47:26,"I mean, he cut a hole in his neck"
00:47:26,00:47:28,so he could dispense loads of bread
00:47:28,00:47:29,when he took his head back.
00:47:29,00:47:30,(laughing)
00:47:30,00:47:32,- It's so unclear what he did.
00:47:32,00:47:35,"There's no further detail, so mystery."
00:47:35,00:47:38,- So the evolution of the Paz dispenser itself
00:47:38,00:47:40,"is very exciting, you know."
00:47:40,00:47:44,Poor Haas the third didn't get to see the feet
00:47:44,00:47:46,that were added to the bottom of a Paz dispenser
00:47:46,00:47:48,to allow it to stand.
00:47:48,00:47:49,That was a big innovation.
00:47:49,00:47:51,It's the Paz we know and love.
00:47:51,00:47:53,"- That was 1987, I believe, wasn't it?"
00:47:53,00:47:54,- That was in '87.
00:47:54,00:47:56,- And they had weird designs before it.
00:47:56,00:47:59,"So before they added the feet, there was one in 1956,"
00:47:59,00:48:02,they invented a sort of space gun.
00:48:02,00:48:04,"And also, from what I've seen, regular looking guns."
00:48:04,00:48:07,So the idea is that the gun would shoot out.
00:48:07,00:48:10,It's like a pistol would shoot out the Paz at the end
00:48:10,00:48:11,into your mouth.
00:48:11,00:48:14,"- Of course, you have to put the gun in your mouth."
00:48:14,00:48:17,- It doesn't seem like.
00:48:17,00:48:19,"- The guy who set up the Paz dispenser,"
00:48:19,00:48:20,"as we know it, is a guy, well,"
00:48:20,00:48:22,"the guy who was in charge of the decision, basically,"
00:48:22,00:48:24,"was a man called Curtis Alina,"
00:48:24,00:48:27,who was a European.
00:48:27,00:48:30,He was born in Prague in 1922.
00:48:30,00:48:33,He was Jewish and that was not a good time
00:48:33,00:48:35,to be born Jewish in Central Europe in Prague.
00:48:35,00:48:38,His family were all sent to concentration camps.
00:48:38,00:48:40,He was the only surviving member of his family
00:48:40,00:48:41,in Europe after the war.
00:48:41,00:48:46,He went to the USA and he started working for Paz.
00:48:46,00:48:49,But the US and the European Paz
00:48:49,00:48:51,were kind of two different camps.
00:48:51,00:48:53,They were quite remote from each other.
00:48:53,00:48:55,They weren't really tied together
00:48:55,00:48:57,and he had to persuade the Viennese outfit.
00:48:57,00:48:59,"They wanted serious sober grown-up mints,"
00:48:59,00:49:00,"you know, adult mints,"
00:49:00,00:49:03,that this dispenser thing was a good idea.
00:49:03,00:49:04,"But I just, I mention all of this"
00:49:04,00:49:06,"because there's a weird link to Sigmund Freud,"
00:49:06,00:49:08,who was from Vienna.
00:49:08,00:49:11,"- Okay, I'm gonna copy the old James Harkinville circle here."
00:49:11,00:49:14,- But the link is not just that they're both in Vienna.
00:49:14,00:49:16,"- Well, he lived across the street from Sigmund Freud"
00:49:16,00:49:18,"when he was a boy, supposedly."
00:49:18,00:49:19,And there was this brilliant website I found
00:49:19,00:49:21,"which is called Freud's Butcher.com,"
00:49:21,00:49:23,which is about the history of Sigmund Freud
00:49:23,00:49:24,by an author called E.D. Jarrellim.
00:49:24,00:49:25,She's great.
00:49:25,00:49:28,"It's a blog about genealogy, psychology and meat, okay?"
00:49:28,00:49:32,And there's a theory that she posits
00:49:32,00:49:37,that Edward Haas III might have been considering
00:49:37,00:49:39,Freud's theory of oral fixation
00:49:39,00:49:40,when he came up with the idea
00:49:40,00:49:43,of substituting peppermint sweets for cigarettes.
00:49:43,00:49:44,"- Oh, I see."
00:49:44,00:49:47,Not that the Paz dispenser looks a bit like a penis.
00:49:47,00:49:48,"- No, that's not."
00:49:48,00:49:51,Although that's an excellent evolution of the theory.
00:49:51,00:49:54,"Maybe he was only thinking about it subconsciously,"
00:49:54,00:49:58,but wouldn't that be appropriate given that it's Freud?
00:49:58,00:49:59,- Yeah?
00:49:59,00:50:01,- What a load of absolute balls.
00:50:01,00:50:03,"Oh, he happened to live in opposite Freud."
00:50:03,00:50:07,What weird convoluted thing can we attribute to that?
00:50:07,00:50:08,- Are you right?
00:50:08,00:50:10,She says it's a huge stretch.
00:50:10,00:50:11,- She says that as well.
00:50:11,00:50:12,- She also says that.
00:50:12,00:50:13,"- Okay, I disagree."
00:50:13,00:50:17,- So have you guys come across Steve Gloo?
00:50:17,00:50:18,"- Oh, no."
00:50:18,00:50:19,- The Paz Outlaw.
00:50:19,00:50:21,"- The Paz Outlaw, self-styled."
00:50:21,00:50:24,- I can't believe I genuinely got like a tingle of goosebumps.
00:50:24,00:50:26,You both got excited by that.
00:50:26,00:50:27,Who's Steve Gloo?
00:50:27,00:50:31,- He is basically the king of collecting pezzas.
00:50:31,00:50:32,So he would go to Europe
00:50:32,00:50:36,"and he would get all of these really, really rare pezzas,"
00:50:36,00:50:37,sometimes digging through garbage
00:50:37,00:50:40,to try and get ones which had been thrown out.
00:50:40,00:50:42,And then he would take them back to America
00:50:42,00:50:45,and he would sell them to Paz enthusiasts.
00:50:45,00:50:48,And he said at one stage he was making $4.5 million.
00:50:48,00:50:52,He made that much in total selling pez candy dispensers
00:50:52,00:50:55,that he'd taken from Eastern Europe and sold in America.
00:50:55,00:50:57,- And it seemed to be there was some kind of loophole
00:50:57,00:50:59,in terms of importing them or...
00:50:59,00:51:02,"- Well, he just sort of snuck through customs"
00:51:02,00:51:03,quite a lot with them.
00:51:03,00:51:06,"And it was, honestly, so this is where I first..."
00:51:06,00:51:07,- Where was he hiding them?
00:51:07,00:51:10,- I think often they didn't check.
00:51:10,00:51:13,- It's just the right shape.
00:51:13,00:51:15,That's why they're shaped like that.
00:51:15,00:51:17,- It wasn't one per trip.
00:51:17,00:51:19,- I don't think that would have been profitable.
00:51:19,00:51:22,- Just a little Mickey Mouse head sticking out his rectum.
00:51:22,00:51:25,- Help yourself to one more year down there.
00:51:25,00:51:29,"- Yeah, this is how I came across this fact initially."
00:51:29,00:51:31,"I was reading a review of ""The Pez Outlaw"""
00:51:31,00:51:33,"which is coming out this year, I think."
00:51:33,00:51:35,And it's the film based on his adventures.
00:51:35,00:51:37,And it sounds proper exciting stuff.
00:51:37,00:51:40,It was him and his son who's an equally avid collector.
00:51:40,00:51:42,And he was real down and out.
00:51:42,00:51:44,Like wasn't making any money until he came across
00:51:44,00:51:46,"this big scam where he'd fly to Eastern Europe,"
00:51:46,00:51:49,go into factories and basically bribe factory workers
00:51:49,00:51:51,to give him a bunch of pez he knew
00:51:51,00:51:52,would be incredibly valuable.
00:51:52,00:51:55,But they drive around in this truck.
00:51:55,00:51:58,Apparently his son said he'd drive 24 hours straight.
00:51:58,00:52:02,He'd be so tired that he often crashed the truck
00:52:02,00:52:04,but just kept plugging away.
00:52:04,00:52:09,And he had this amazing rival called Patek
00:52:09,00:52:14,who was another Pez guy who also got first dibs
00:52:14,00:52:16,in the factories and flogged pez.
00:52:16,00:52:19,And apparently at one point glue pursued Patek
00:52:19,00:52:21,across Austria in a car chase.
00:52:21,00:52:24,And I said that they like drove on pavements.
00:52:24,00:52:25,They were on the wrong side of the road.
00:52:25,00:52:28,They had to bribe police with Pez dispensers
00:52:28,00:52:29,full of cash he played.
00:52:29,00:52:31,(laughing)
00:52:31,00:52:34,- It could only be tiny little son teams.
00:52:34,00:52:36,- They went with notes apparently.
00:52:36,00:52:37,I don't know how many notes you can fit in.
00:52:37,00:52:39,A couple of hundred dollar bills maybe.
00:52:39,00:52:42,"- But then of course big Pez got involved, right?"
00:52:42,00:52:43,- Big Pez?
00:52:43,00:52:45,- And so this guy decided he sort of
00:52:45,00:52:47,did a little bit of a deal with a guy in Hungary
00:52:47,00:52:50,and said that this guy would make extras for him.
00:52:50,00:52:53,And they would discontinued ones as well sometimes.
00:52:53,00:52:56,"So they'd be really, really good expensive,"
00:52:56,00:52:57,"you know, rare Pezes."
00:52:57,00:52:59,This guy in Hungary would make them for him
00:52:59,00:53:00,and he would buy loads of them
00:53:00,00:53:03,and then take them back to America and sell them.
00:53:03,00:53:05,But one day he logged into the Pez website
00:53:05,00:53:08,and he found a new section called misfit dispensers.
00:53:08,00:53:10,And it was all the ones that he'd bought
00:53:10,00:53:12,"from this guy in Hungary,"
00:53:12,00:53:15,but Pez was selling them for like a dollar each.
00:53:15,00:53:17,And they basically just flooded the market
00:53:17,00:53:19,with other ones.
00:53:19,00:53:24,"And he reckons that it left him $250,000 in debt."
00:53:24,00:53:26,This one trick.
00:53:26,00:53:29,"And when he rang up this broker in Hungary and said,"
00:53:29,00:53:31,"""What's happened? Why are they doing this?"""
00:53:31,00:53:33,"The broker said, ""The right hand knows"
00:53:33,00:53:35,"what the left is doing."""
00:53:35,00:53:37,So basically it was all a scam.
00:53:37,00:53:39,They just basically fitted him up.
00:53:39,00:53:41,- That's extraordinary.
00:53:41,00:53:43,- So the dispenser was made by someone called Oscar.
00:53:44,00:53:46,(speaks in foreign language)
00:53:46,00:53:50,And his patent actually said that it would be helpful
00:53:50,00:53:52,for people who have only one hand.
00:53:52,00:53:55,"So it was a way of dispensing sweets from a box,"
00:53:55,00:53:57,but you only need one hand to do it.
00:53:57,00:53:59,And that's what it says in the patent.
00:53:59,00:54:01,It's useful for people with one hand.
00:54:01,00:54:02,"- That's why it's so useful, actually,"
00:54:02,00:54:05,for the pensioners at Dan's Blue Movie Cinema
00:54:05,00:54:08,who want to have a hand-free and enjoy a cinema snack.
00:54:08,00:54:11,"- Dan's Blue Movie Cinema, as it is otherwise known."
00:54:11,00:54:13,"- As it will be, 'cause they're selling it, aren't they?"
00:54:13,00:54:15,- I have a balloon in my beard.
00:54:15,00:54:17,- Because in the patent it says it's important
00:54:17,00:54:19,"not only for persons who have only one hand,"
00:54:19,00:54:22,but also persons who often have only one hand free.
00:54:22,00:54:24,- Right. - There we go.
00:54:24,00:54:26,- His occupation causes their hands
00:54:26,00:54:28,to become smeared with dirt.
00:54:28,00:54:30,"- Well, this is all brilliant news, Dan."
00:54:30,00:54:31,- Get in touch with your drums.
00:54:31,00:54:33,- Freud's penis dispenser in one hand
00:54:33,00:54:35,and your actual penis in the other.
00:54:35,00:54:36,(laughing)
00:54:36,00:54:39,(upbeat music)
00:54:39,00:54:41,"- Okay, that's it."
