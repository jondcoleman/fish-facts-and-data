1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,840
 (percussive music)

2
00:00:02,840 --> 00:00:17,440
 - Hey everyone, welcome to this week's episode of Fish.

3
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:19,600
 Before we get going, just wanna let you know,

4
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:20,880
 thank you for all your feedback

5
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:23,560
 about last week's ultimate crossover episode.

6
00:00:23,560 --> 00:00:24,880
 It was very enjoyable to do.

7
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:28,000
 In fact, so much so, we've decided to do it again.

8
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,280
 Except this time, we've decided to crossover completely,

9
00:00:31,280 --> 00:00:34,640
 a full crossover, a 360 crossover.

10
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:36,920
 - Done, we messed up again, didn't we?

11
00:00:36,920 --> 00:00:41,920
 - We lost an entire episode, somehow.

12
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:45,080
 - So if you were in Bristol a few months ago,

13
00:00:45,080 --> 00:00:46,840
 quite a few months ago, you will have seen

14
00:00:46,840 --> 00:00:48,000
 an amazing show, guys.

15
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,520
 I gotta tell you, this was one of the best shows we ever did.

16
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:52,880
 Unfortunately, it doesn't seem like we recorded it.

17
00:00:52,880 --> 00:00:55,320
 - So only you, Bristolians, will have the memory

18
00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:56,480
 of that show.

19
00:00:56,480 --> 00:00:59,920
 And then this is kind of the lesser version, you say?

20
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:00,760
 - Yeah.

21
00:01:00,760 --> 00:01:01,760
 - Oh, it's still worth listening to.

22
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:02,600
 - I would say.

23
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:05,080
 Definitely one for the completest, I'd say.

24
00:01:05,080 --> 00:01:06,600
 - Yes.

25
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:08,680
 - Yeah, it's amazing how negative you guys are.

26
00:01:08,680 --> 00:01:10,000
 We haven't even recorded it yet.

27
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,600
 (all laughing)

28
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:13,560
 - So enjoy this week's episode.

29
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:14,400
 Here we go.

30
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:15,800
 (upbeat music)

31
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:19,080
 Hello and welcome to another episode of No Such Thing

32
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:21,360
 as a Fish, a weekly podcast coming to you

33
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:23,800
 from the QI offices in Covert Garden.

34
00:01:23,800 --> 00:01:26,120
 My name is Dan Schreiber, and I'm sitting here

35
00:01:26,120 --> 00:01:29,960
 with Andrew Hunter Murray, James Harkin, and Anna Chazinski.

36
00:01:29,960 --> 00:01:32,280
 And once again, we have gathered around the microphones

37
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:35,400
 with our four favorite facts from the last seven days.

38
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:38,160
 And in a particular order, here we go.

39
00:01:38,160 --> 00:01:40,440
 Starting with you, Andy.

40
00:01:40,440 --> 00:01:43,240
 - Okay, my fact is, it's about Bristol, actually.

41
00:01:43,240 --> 00:01:44,800
 I've just chosen completely at random

42
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:46,720
 out of all the cities I could have chosen.

43
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:48,400
 And I learned it about four months ago,

44
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:50,600
 shortly before we performed in Bristol.

45
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:53,960
 My fact this week is that the first hot air balloon flight

46
00:01:53,960 --> 00:01:56,120
 in Bristol was indoors.

47
00:01:56,120 --> 00:01:59,440
 And people at home have to imagine

48
00:01:59,440 --> 00:02:01,480
 the cheers and laughter of the Bristol crowd

49
00:02:01,480 --> 00:02:02,480
 when they first heard that.

50
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:04,720
 - They went nuts when Andy said that.

51
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:06,080
 My God.

52
00:02:06,080 --> 00:02:08,200
 - So there's this firm in Bristol called Cameron Balloons,

53
00:02:08,200 --> 00:02:09,960
 and it's the world's biggest balloon firm.

54
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:12,520
 Basically, Bristol is the capital of hot air ballooning

55
00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:14,560
 pretty much in the world, definitely in the UK.

56
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:15,400
 - Yep.

57
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:17,800
 - And the first flight was in 1784,

58
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:20,160
 and you had to go indoors to see it.

59
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:22,120
 And you had to pay a little amount to see it.

60
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:24,240
 And if you paid more, apparently you could see it filled up

61
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:25,080
 with air.

62
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:26,920
 - Apparently it was a pricing structural way.

63
00:02:26,920 --> 00:02:27,760
 - Wait a minute.

64
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:29,160
 So the people who didn't pay much,

65
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:30,920
 they just saw a load of canvas.

66
00:02:30,920 --> 00:02:32,920
 - It sounds like that, doesn't it?

67
00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:34,200
 I can't quite believe that, that's true.

68
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:35,600
 - Was this new to people at the time?

69
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:40,080
 As in, how long did Balloons exist before this happens?

70
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:41,080
 - That's a great question.

71
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:41,920
 - Really good question.

72
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:44,720
 - So they had the Aztecs.

73
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:48,040
 They had, they made like Balloons

74
00:02:48,040 --> 00:02:50,200
 out of animal intestines.

75
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:51,880
 I think we know that.

76
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:54,920
 And I remember reading once that they made Balloon animals

77
00:02:54,920 --> 00:02:55,920
 out of those intestines.

78
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:57,400
 (laughing)

79
00:02:57,400 --> 00:03:00,280
 But I don't know if that doesn't sound very true, does it?

80
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:02,840
 - So, I mean, how big were the animals back then?

81
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:03,680
 - What do you mean?

82
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:05,240
 - As in, do they make like a full hot air balloon out

83
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:06,080
 of an animal?

84
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:06,920
 - No, no, no, sorry.

85
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:09,320
 So just Balloons in general, I'm saying about the history

86
00:03:09,320 --> 00:03:11,000
 of not the history of hot air balloons.

87
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,960
 (laughing)

88
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:14,960
 - And the Civil War, they definitely had hot air balloons

89
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:18,600
 'cause Lincoln had a hot air balloon balloon corp.

90
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:19,440
 Corps.

91
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:20,280
 - Cool.

92
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:21,120
 - Corps.

93
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:24,360
 - Just keep throwing guesses at the letters that you see.

94
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:25,440
 - Corps.

95
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:26,440
 - Corps.

96
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:27,720
 (laughing)

97
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:30,480
 - Yeah, he had a balloon corp and they had seven Balloons

98
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:33,320
 and they used to go over and the Confederates actually

99
00:03:33,320 --> 00:03:35,960
 tried to build their own Balloons in retaliation

100
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:36,920
 and then they stopped doing them

101
00:03:36,920 --> 00:03:39,000
 because people found them really easy to shoot.

102
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,480
 It was quite an easy target.

103
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:42,480
 So we know it goes back as far as the Civil War

104
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:43,960
 in America, at least.

105
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:45,720
 - Yeah, they were actually a huge deal

106
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:47,800
 in the 19th century hot air balloon flights.

107
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:50,720
 And I think in 1897 there was an attempt

108
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:52,440
 to reach the North Pole by balloon.

109
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:54,560
 That was three Swedish people who tried to get there.

110
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:55,400
 They disappeared.

111
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:56,520
 No one knew what happened to them.

112
00:03:56,520 --> 00:03:58,720
 There were these reports of silk falling from the sky.

113
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:01,720
 And then randomly in 1930, 33 years later,

114
00:04:01,720 --> 00:04:04,760
 they were found in this Thor by Whalers just by chance.

115
00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:08,240
 They found as the Thor came the bodies of these guys

116
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:09,960
 and they'd crashed after three days

117
00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:11,560
 but they'd lived on these ice flows

118
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:13,520
 and they'd eaten polar bears for--

119
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:16,120
 - Wow, that is hard cars, yeah.

120
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:16,960
 - That's amazing.

121
00:04:16,960 --> 00:04:19,480
 - I reckon I'd go hungry before I decided to go for

122
00:04:19,480 --> 00:04:21,480
 - Oh, look at that.

123
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:22,920
 - It was so sad though, 'cause they were convinced

124
00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:26,080
 that they could steer their balloon over the North Pole.

125
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:28,160
 And it was partly funded by Alfred Nobel.

126
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:29,720
 Their attempt, yeah.

127
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:32,800
 And but unfortunately the drag ropes didn't work very well

128
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:34,400
 and in a few minutes they fell off

129
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:35,920
 so they had no way of steering.

130
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:37,360
 So they lost lots of ballast

131
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:39,080
 and they kept on just bumping along the ground

132
00:04:39,080 --> 00:04:41,120
 and leaking a bit and then rising a bit.

133
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:43,440
 And it took them 65 hours to land

134
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:45,040
 and they didn't get to the stores in time.

135
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:46,040
 So it was sad.

136
00:04:46,040 --> 00:04:47,560
 - The other thing about eating polar bears

137
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:49,840
 is their liver's contained so much vitamin A

138
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:51,160
 that they're poisonous.

139
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:52,000
 - Yeah, that's awful.

140
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
 If you're diving vitamin A poisoning,

141
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,880
 want to survive the hot air balloon crash

142
00:04:55,880 --> 00:04:57,920
 onto an ice flow and then pour a polar bear

143
00:04:57,920 --> 00:04:59,760
 to death with your bare hands.

144
00:04:59,760 --> 00:05:02,920
 - This is quite cool about higher balloons.

145
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:05,920
 So usually you're not allowed to fly in rain

146
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:08,520
 and so it's all weather dependent, isn't it,

147
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:09,800
 if anyone tries to fly.

148
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:11,440
 They can't actually fly in wet weather.

149
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:13,000
 I guess it's just not recommended.

150
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,160
 But when you do fly in wet weather,

151
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:16,360
 the rain gets caught in

152
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:19,720
 and actually goes over the people inside the basket

153
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:22,080
 so it makes its way into the...

154
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:23,400
 But because of the flames,

155
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:25,840
 it comes down like a hot shower.

156
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:28,680
 So it's really warm water that drops on them.

157
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:31,240
 - That's nice. - Yeah, that's very cool.

158
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:33,000
 Have you heard of splash and dash?

159
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,240
 While we're talking about water and hot air ballooning?

160
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:36,080
 - No.

161
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:36,920
 - Splash and dash is a cool thing you can do

162
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:38,120
 if you have a hot air balloon.

163
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:39,760
 It's what you sink just low enough

164
00:05:39,760 --> 00:05:42,680
 to dip your toes into a lake and then climb up again.

165
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:43,520
 - Oh cool.

166
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:44,360
 - It's pretty risky.

167
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:46,600
 - Your toe is below the bottom of the basket.

168
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:49,160
 - Well, there is a trend for ballooning

169
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:50,760
 with no basket these days.

170
00:05:50,760 --> 00:05:52,200
 - No way. - You have a sofa.

171
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:53,320
 - You have a sofa.

172
00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:54,160
 - What?

173
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:55,000
 - Yeah.

174
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,000
 - No way.

175
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:56,840
 - No way.

176
00:05:56,840 --> 00:05:58,720
 - It's not very common.

177
00:05:58,720 --> 00:05:59,960
 - It's a trend though.

178
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:01,600
 - It's a trend.

179
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:03,160
 - You're serious people can go up in a sofa,

180
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:04,840
 do they have to be strapped in, right?

181
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:09,240
 - I think it's really recommended that you try something.

182
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:10,080
 - I don't know though,

183
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:12,160
 because I never fall enough myselfer.

184
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:13,000
 - That's true.

185
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:16,000
 - I mean, I don't know if that's true, but you look to me

186
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,320
 like the kind of guy who wouldn't.

187
00:06:17,320 --> 00:06:20,400
 - They protect the things that are easy to kind of sail.

188
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:21,400
 - That's true, yeah?

189
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:23,960
 - No, if it's swinging in high winds from a balloon

190
00:06:23,960 --> 00:06:25,680
 as a thousand feet up,

191
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:27,480
 I don't have belts on my sofa,

192
00:06:27,480 --> 00:06:29,280
 so I think mine wouldn't be safe at all.

193
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:31,520
 - Well, I've had belts fitted to all my soapers at home

194
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:32,920
 and just in case,

195
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:35,440
 and they save my life on countless occasions.

196
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:38,880
 Well, speaking of no baskets for a hot air balloon,

197
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:43,400
 have you heard of, they're called smoke hot air balloons?

198
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:46,160
 It was a carnival attraction that used to happen.

199
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:48,040
 So this is during the 1800s,

200
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:49,880
 and there's footage that you can see of this online,

201
00:06:49,880 --> 00:06:51,040
 and it's honestly incredible.

202
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:53,480
 This was a daredevil thing.

203
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:55,520
 So what they would do is,

204
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:58,600
 daredevil's would attach themselves by a rope

205
00:06:58,600 --> 00:07:01,080
 to an inflating hot air balloon with no baskets,

206
00:07:01,080 --> 00:07:02,400
 so simply the balloon.

207
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:05,000
 So the balloon would completely fill up.

208
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:05,920
 They would untether it,

209
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:07,760
 and it would rock it off into the sky,

210
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:10,160
 and these people would just be dragged behind it

211
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:11,280
 on the end of the ropes,

212
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:13,320
 and would fly up after it.

213
00:07:13,320 --> 00:07:14,840
 And when they got to a certain height,

214
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:17,960
 they would loosen themselves from the rope,

215
00:07:17,960 --> 00:07:20,200
 fall down and parachute back to Earth.

216
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:22,200
 - Very cool. - Well, it's absolutely incredible.

217
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:23,640
 You see them lob up in these people.

218
00:07:23,640 --> 00:07:25,480
 They're surrounded by people in the videos,

219
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:28,360
 and they just go fong and disappear off into the air.

220
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:30,440
 - But you have to loosen yourself up before it gets too high,

221
00:07:30,440 --> 00:07:32,280
 presumably. - Yeah, I think you obviously know

222
00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:33,720
 when it's you've had enough.

223
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:34,880
 - Okay. - Yeah.

224
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:38,080
 - I thought you were going to say they shot the balloon down.

225
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:38,920
 Why?

226
00:07:38,920 --> 00:07:41,320
 (laughing)

227
00:07:41,320 --> 00:07:43,600
 'Cause I didn't imagine that they had a parachute on

228
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:44,600
 when you were describing it.

229
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:46,880
 So I was thinking how would I get myself out of this one?

230
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:47,720
 - Yeah.

231
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:49,960
 - And I would have, my first choice would have been a gun

232
00:07:49,960 --> 00:07:51,280
 instead of a parachute.

233
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:53,200
 (laughing)

234
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:55,560
 - What one item do you want to take up from you?

235
00:07:55,560 --> 00:07:57,640
 (laughing)

236
00:07:57,640 --> 00:07:59,440
 - I read a brilliant account.

237
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:01,280
 This is actually the source of 1838,

238
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:03,880
 but it was about something that happened in 1785,

239
00:08:03,880 --> 00:08:05,640
 and it was when Jean-Pierre Blanchard,

240
00:08:05,640 --> 00:08:07,640
 who was one of the first people to go up in a hot air balloon,

241
00:08:07,640 --> 00:08:10,160
 went up, he went 6,000 feet up,

242
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:12,360
 and then he dropped from his hot air balloon,

243
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:14,640
 a dog attached to a parachute,

244
00:08:14,640 --> 00:08:16,400
 just to kind of see what would happen,

245
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:19,720
 and this whirlwind apparently swept the dog away

246
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:22,280
 above the clouds, so it kind of disappeared,

247
00:08:22,280 --> 00:08:24,320
 and Blanchard is in his balloon.

248
00:08:24,320 --> 00:08:27,840
 This is what the account says, handed down through the ages.

249
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:29,120
 Blanchard was in his balloon,

250
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:32,600
 and he met the dog in his parachute above the clouds.

251
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:33,440
 - This is rubbish.

252
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:35,240
 - Do you remember that thing with that sauce?

253
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:36,080
 (laughing)

254
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:37,360
 - He got the loop the loop guy.

255
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:38,440
 - Yeah, which is true.

256
00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:40,360
 - He fell out of his plane during a loop the loop,

257
00:08:40,360 --> 00:08:43,120
 and then fell back into it once it had finished doing the loop.

258
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:45,880
 - Yeah, so he was upside down, he fell down,

259
00:08:45,880 --> 00:08:47,040
 he thought he was doomed,

260
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:48,720
 but his plane, which was mid-loop the loop,

261
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:50,160
 met him at the bottom.

262
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:52,200
 - So remember how obviously fells that was?

263
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:53,640
 - Look, your thing sounds similar.

264
00:08:53,640 --> 00:08:55,080
 - Dan's defies physics.

265
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:57,040
 Mine, imagine a really small dog,

266
00:08:57,040 --> 00:08:59,880
 like a little terrier, with a parachute in high winds.

267
00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:01,960
 It could be swept away into the clouds,

268
00:09:01,960 --> 00:09:04,680
 and then old Blanchard saw his dog above the clouds,

269
00:09:04,680 --> 00:09:07,280
 who barked with joy apparently at seeing his master.

270
00:09:07,280 --> 00:09:08,360
 He tried to grab him,

271
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:10,400
 and they both had landed 12 minutes later,

272
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:12,520
 separately after which the dog ran away.

273
00:09:12,520 --> 00:09:14,000
 - When you say barked with joy,

274
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
 do you not mean barked in absolute terror?

275
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,000
 - barked in like,

276
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,120
 "Why the fuck do you just drop me out of that balloon, mate?"

277
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:20,720
 - He then shits himself with joy.

278
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:23,200
 (laughing)

279
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:26,920
 - Ben Franklin patented a balloon-related thing,

280
00:09:26,920 --> 00:09:28,280
 like he painted it everything else.

281
00:09:28,280 --> 00:09:31,880
 - He patented a refrigerator that tethered to a balloon,

282
00:09:31,880 --> 00:09:34,640
 and it was meant to lift food up into where the air was cool,

283
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:36,880
 and that's how you'd refrigerate your food.

284
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:37,720
 - Why?

285
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:38,560
 - I have heard of that before.

286
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:39,560
 - That is so cool.

287
00:09:39,560 --> 00:09:40,600
 - It's inconvenient, though.

288
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:41,440
 - It is.

289
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:43,480
 If you're going for a late-night snack, it's...

290
00:09:43,480 --> 00:09:44,920
 - But what you have to do is pull it down.

291
00:09:44,920 --> 00:09:46,640
 You just kind of winch it back down.

292
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:47,480
 - Yeah.

293
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:48,320
 - You get your food out,

294
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:49,160
 and then you let it go back up again.

295
00:09:49,160 --> 00:09:50,600
 - Again, I was thinking of shooting it down,

296
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:51,440
 I feel like.

297
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:52,480
 - By the anti-thing.

298
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:53,480
 (laughing)

299
00:09:53,480 --> 00:09:55,200
 - These eggs are broken again.

300
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:56,920
 (laughing)

301
00:09:56,920 --> 00:09:59,520
 (upbeat music)

302
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:02,360
 (upbeat music)

303
00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:04,200
 - Okay, it is time for fact number two,

304
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:06,320
 and that is Chuzinski.

305
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:08,520
 - My fact this week is that in rage rooms,

306
00:10:08,520 --> 00:10:10,480
 where people pay to smash things up,

307
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:13,400
 the things people want to smash up the most are printers.

308
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:15,880
 Yeah, they hate them.

309
00:10:15,880 --> 00:10:16,840
 They hate printers.

310
00:10:16,840 --> 00:10:18,240
 So, rage rooms are these things

311
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:20,160
 that are kind of popping up all over the place.

312
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:22,440
 Quite a few of them in America and in Canada,

313
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:23,840
 where you pay to go,

314
00:10:23,840 --> 00:10:26,200
 and you can either smash up their possessions,

315
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:28,000
 so they provide a bunch of stuff,

316
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,320
 or you can bring your own stuff,

317
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:31,440
 and they're becoming increasingly popular.

318
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:33,360
 - Better to do someone else's stuff, right?

319
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:34,480
 - Well, I think it depends.

320
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:35,640
 How much you just like that person.

321
00:10:35,640 --> 00:10:37,240
 - If you just like your own stuff a lot.

322
00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:38,880
 - Yeah, well, why did you pay it then?

323
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:40,040
 - I know, but let's say you've got a pen

324
00:10:40,040 --> 00:10:40,960
 that you really don't like.

325
00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:42,720
 - You're not gonna smash up a pen.

326
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:45,800
 - That is the most pussy rage room attendant

327
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:46,640
 I've ever seen.

328
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:47,480
 - What?

329
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:48,320
 - You turning up with one bike.

330
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:49,320
 - You're right.

331
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:50,160
 (laughing)

332
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:51,160
 - I'm now with this guy, baby.

333
00:10:51,160 --> 00:10:52,720
 - He keeps leaking.

334
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:54,160
 - I do it really psychologically though.

335
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:57,360
 I put it in a chair and then I shine a light in it's nib.

336
00:10:57,360 --> 00:10:58,480
 (laughing)

337
00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:00,640
 - I asked you to let a question before I beat it up.

338
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:02,000
 (laughing)

339
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,440
 - I'm holding a pen, I'm sorry,

340
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:05,960
 I've got a poor imagination.

341
00:11:05,960 --> 00:11:07,080
 - I love at the end of the hour

342
00:11:07,080 --> 00:11:09,000
 you come up slightly beat up somehow.

343
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,160
 (laughing)

344
00:11:11,160 --> 00:11:13,200
 - Just got stuff drawn over the space.

345
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:14,480
 (laughing)

346
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:16,600
 - Pen strolls out nonchalantly out of you.

347
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:17,520
 (laughing)

348
00:11:17,520 --> 00:11:18,360
 Hails a cab.

349
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:20,640
 (laughing)

350
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:21,880
 - But no, this is a thing if you go through

351
00:11:21,880 --> 00:11:23,000
 the rage room site.

352
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,440
 There's a one called Battle Sports in Toronto

353
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:28,160
 that says it goes through 15 printers a week.

354
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:31,120
 The same in New York and the fragment room and Singapore.

355
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:33,920
 They also printers are almost sold after objects.

356
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:34,960
 We need to provide lots of them.

357
00:11:34,960 --> 00:11:36,240
 People want to break them up.

358
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:38,440
 - I like this in America in New York.

359
00:11:38,440 --> 00:11:40,800
 There's the Reckon Club and the Reckon Club,

360
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:43,360
 it has, you know, you can get packages that you can buy.

361
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:44,560
 So I want it all.

362
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:47,920
 It's a package you can get, which is $149.

363
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:49,840
 You can even buy gift certificates for people.

364
00:11:49,840 --> 00:11:51,680
 So, you know, both they presence,

365
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:53,120
 go for an hour in the rage room.

366
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:54,920
 - They should have called it the Reckfast Club.

367
00:11:54,920 --> 00:11:56,000
 - Yes, they should have.

368
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:56,840
 Very nice.

369
00:11:56,840 --> 00:11:57,680
 - Why didn't they?

370
00:11:57,680 --> 00:11:58,760
 - We should start our own.

371
00:11:58,760 --> 00:12:00,240
 You and your pen's only.

372
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:02,360
 (all laughing)

373
00:12:02,360 --> 00:12:04,880
 - Yeah, so what's nice about this is it's the same,

374
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:06,600
 obviously, like every rage room you go in

375
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:08,680
 and you destroy stuff, but what I particularly like

376
00:12:08,680 --> 00:12:11,800
 is when they started, there was a guy who runs it

377
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:14,840
 called Mr. Daily or Dally, D-A-L-Y.

378
00:12:14,840 --> 00:12:16,400
 - Dally, he's got Tom Daley, I think, actually.

379
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:17,960
 - Oh, is he, Mr. Tom Daley.

380
00:12:17,960 --> 00:12:19,800
 So he, when he was in there and they say

381
00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:21,880
 this was an early setback, he was in the room

382
00:12:21,880 --> 00:12:23,640
 showing a couple of all the things

383
00:12:23,640 --> 00:12:26,200
 that they could do via his laptop, a video.

384
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:27,800
 And then he left the room, but he accidentally left

385
00:12:27,800 --> 00:12:29,720
 the laptop in there, he smashed it up.

386
00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:31,080
 (all laughing)

387
00:12:31,080 --> 00:12:33,040
 Yeah, so he came back in there, the other guy was like,

388
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:33,880
 "Ah!"

389
00:12:33,880 --> 00:12:34,720
 And he didn't tell them, 'cause he thought,

390
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:36,000
 "Oh, I don't want to ruin their experience."

391
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,240
 But he, as of then, started labeling everything

392
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:39,320
 as, "Don't smash this."

393
00:12:39,320 --> 00:12:42,120
 - I went on the Wikipedia for rage rooms,

394
00:12:42,120 --> 00:12:43,600
 but I did it about four months ago,

395
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:46,040
 so it might have been changed by now.

396
00:12:46,040 --> 00:12:48,080
 But they said that the concept of an anger room

397
00:12:48,080 --> 00:12:52,040
 is at least 20, at least 2000 years old.

398
00:12:52,040 --> 00:12:52,880
 - Is it?

399
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:54,560
 - Yeah, but that's what Wikipedia says,

400
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:55,880
 and who are we to doubt them?

401
00:12:55,880 --> 00:12:56,720
 - What are they saying about this?

402
00:12:56,720 --> 00:12:59,480
 - They say it was Queen Kaikei,

403
00:12:59,480 --> 00:13:01,920
 who in an old book was said that she was going to,

404
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:06,000
 the palace anger room, and actually it was a sulking chamber

405
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,000
 when I looked it up.

406
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,680
 That's how it's usually translated.

407
00:13:08,680 --> 00:13:10,040
 - Apparently it was like a dark room

408
00:13:10,040 --> 00:13:12,240
 where you would lie down and sulk.

409
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:13,520
 - Mm-hmm.

410
00:13:13,520 --> 00:13:14,600
 - Yeah, so not really arranged.

411
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:16,320
 - I do like the sound of that though.

412
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:19,320
 - Yeah, yeah, 'cause people rage manifest differently,

413
00:13:19,320 --> 00:13:20,160
 doesn't it?

414
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:21,760
 Some people just want to lie down in the dark

415
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:24,000
 and be really pissed off with the world.

416
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,560
 Some of us like to smash our exes stuff.

417
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:27,480
 Actually the most,

418
00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:31,440
 the most I say that because I think the most common thing

419
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:33,440
 for people who do bring in their own things

420
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:34,720
 are people who've had a breakup

421
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:36,680
 and they bring in all their exes old stuff.

422
00:13:36,680 --> 00:13:38,000
 This is what the Toronto play said.

423
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,400
 So it's said for $20 extra,

424
00:13:39,400 --> 00:13:41,320
 you can bring your own stuff to smash.

425
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:43,560
 And the founder said that by far and away,

426
00:13:43,560 --> 00:13:45,960
 the most common thing to do is to bring in your exes stuff.

427
00:13:45,960 --> 00:13:47,440
 And he said, "The people often come in

428
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:49,280
 and you'll hear them screaming and shouting in there,

429
00:13:49,280 --> 00:13:51,760
 things like, oh, you think you're so good?

430
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:54,160
 Argg, and then you'll hear us smash."

431
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:55,360
 - You think you're always right?

432
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:56,800
 - I think that's pronounced "Arg."

433
00:13:56,800 --> 00:13:58,320
 (laughing)

434
00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:00,560
 - How do you spell "Arg" then?

435
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:01,640
 Is it without the age?

436
00:14:01,640 --> 00:14:02,720
 - I don't think there is a word.

437
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:03,720
 - Who says "Arg"?

438
00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:04,880
 - Pirates.

439
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:06,240
 - No, they don't, they go, "Arg."

440
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:07,400
 - Oh yeah.

441
00:14:07,400 --> 00:14:10,720
 - Oh, we've not been hearing the end of their sentence.

442
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:12,840
 (laughing)

443
00:14:12,840 --> 00:14:15,520
 - One of the first ones that was set up in Dallas in 2011

444
00:14:15,520 --> 00:14:17,360
 by a lady called Donna Alexander.

445
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:20,240
 And she just started charging $5 to smash things

446
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:22,640
 that she collected from curbs in the area.

447
00:14:22,640 --> 00:14:23,480
 - Herica.

448
00:14:23,480 --> 00:14:24,320
 - She just sort of picked it up.

449
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:25,440
 So it was very ad hoc at the beginning.

450
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:27,000
 And then she'd get people knocking on her door,

451
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,520
 kind of like a fight club saying,

452
00:14:28,520 --> 00:14:30,520
 "Is this where you go to smash stuff up?"

453
00:14:30,520 --> 00:14:33,400
 And her insurer had to invent an entirely new category

454
00:14:33,400 --> 00:14:34,880
 just for her.

455
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:36,240
 - Oh, very exciting.

456
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:37,080
 - Yeah.

457
00:14:37,080 --> 00:14:38,520
 - And what do you mean by just picking stuff up

458
00:14:38,520 --> 00:14:40,080
 like as in flight tipping?

459
00:14:40,080 --> 00:14:41,680
 - You know when people leave things out,

460
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:43,960
 exactly flight tipping, like leave an old fridge out

461
00:14:43,960 --> 00:14:47,000
 or drop a lot of pens that they don't want anymore

462
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:50,040
 for the faulty kind of thing.

463
00:14:50,040 --> 00:14:50,880
 - That's really cool.

464
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:52,440
 - Yeah.

465
00:14:52,440 --> 00:14:53,440
 - Stuff on printers?

466
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:54,280
 - Oh yeah.

467
00:14:54,280 --> 00:14:55,840
 - I was reading about printer jams

468
00:14:55,840 --> 00:14:58,840
 and everyone finds them very annoying.

469
00:14:58,840 --> 00:15:00,760
 Apart from people who work in printers

470
00:15:00,760 --> 00:15:02,960
 who find them really exciting.

471
00:15:02,960 --> 00:15:07,080
 I say it's the it's the it's the elemental struggle

472
00:15:07,080 --> 00:15:08,920
 between the natural and the mechanical

473
00:15:08,920 --> 00:15:10,960
 because paper is made out of trees

474
00:15:10,960 --> 00:15:15,040
 and printers are made out of metal and shit and plastic.

475
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:16,360
 - I think the ultimate challenge

476
00:15:16,360 --> 00:15:17,960
 is throwing a dog with a parachute

477
00:15:17,960 --> 00:15:21,120
 out of a hot air balloon and then catching it again.

478
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:24,880
 - Do you guys know about the first printer ever to go into space?

479
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:26,040
 - No.

480
00:15:26,040 --> 00:15:29,640
 - This was a printer that was sent up on the ISS in 1998.

481
00:15:29,640 --> 00:15:32,840
 Sorry, this was the first color printer ever to go into space.

482
00:15:32,840 --> 00:15:33,760
 (laughing)

483
00:15:33,760 --> 00:15:38,080
 So it was sent up in 1998 with a discovery mission

484
00:15:38,080 --> 00:15:41,480
 and it was used solely to make Halloween masks.

485
00:15:41,480 --> 00:15:42,520
 So it was sent up.

486
00:15:42,520 --> 00:15:43,680
 It was kind of a secret thing.

487
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:45,720
 So John Glenn, who was by then a senator,

488
00:15:45,720 --> 00:15:46,920
 was on that mission.

489
00:15:46,920 --> 00:15:50,560
 But he'd been the third person I think to orbit the Earth

490
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:52,000
 in 1962.

491
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,800
 And so he was this big space hero by that point.

492
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:56,560
 And so on that 1998 mission,

493
00:15:56,560 --> 00:15:58,440
 the whole crew printed color portraits of him

494
00:15:58,440 --> 00:16:00,560
 off this floppy disk and they made these portraits

495
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:01,760
 into Halloween masks.

496
00:16:01,760 --> 00:16:03,680
 And then they all went around pretending to be John Glenn

497
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:05,960
 in a nod to his greatness.

498
00:16:05,960 --> 00:16:06,800
 - Cool.

499
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:08,240
 I'd print out a full alien costume

500
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:10,000
 and then sell it to take it to myself

501
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,640
 and then freak my crew mates out.

502
00:16:11,640 --> 00:16:13,200
 - Do you think they'd fall for that?

503
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:15,040
 Because I don't think anyone was floating around

504
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:16,400
 going oh my god it's John Glenn.

505
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:19,360
 Oh my god it's John Glenn, oh my god it's John Glenn.

506
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:20,520
 - That's true.

507
00:16:20,520 --> 00:16:23,100
 (upbeat music)

508
00:16:23,100 --> 00:16:29,160
 - Okay, it is time for fact number three.

509
00:16:29,160 --> 00:16:30,720
 And that is my fact.

510
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:33,160
 My fact this week is one of the first things

511
00:16:33,160 --> 00:16:35,360
 that McDonald's founder Ray Crock did

512
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:38,640
 when he bought the baseball team San Diego Padres

513
00:16:38,640 --> 00:16:41,520
 was to sign a player called Big Mac.

514
00:16:41,520 --> 00:16:42,440
 - Very good.

515
00:16:42,440 --> 00:16:44,880
 Did he do it because he was the founder of McDonald's

516
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:46,040
 or was he just a good baseball player?

517
00:16:46,040 --> 00:16:47,920
 - Big Mac was a great baseball player.

518
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:50,600
 Willie MacCovie was his real name.

519
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:53,880
 He was a very good player and obviously Ray Crock

520
00:16:53,880 --> 00:16:58,480
 who built McDonald's from a very tiny brother operation

521
00:16:58,480 --> 00:17:01,120
 of the McDonald brothers into the global success it was.

522
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:03,720
 Had an eye for franchising, for merchandising,

523
00:17:03,720 --> 00:17:04,840
 for commercialization.

524
00:17:04,840 --> 00:17:06,520
 He saw that by getting Big Mac in

525
00:17:06,520 --> 00:17:09,080
 he could do a lot of cross promotion.

526
00:17:09,080 --> 00:17:11,760
 So for example, during the first season

527
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:13,640
 they did Big Mac Sundays.

528
00:17:13,640 --> 00:17:15,960
 So the idea would be that you could take a ticket stub

529
00:17:15,960 --> 00:17:18,800
 and get a free Big Mac after a match

530
00:17:18,800 --> 00:17:20,280
 if the Padres had won.

531
00:17:20,280 --> 00:17:22,080
 Unfortunately when the promotion started

532
00:17:22,080 --> 00:17:23,920
 they lost 11 straight home games.

533
00:17:23,920 --> 00:17:26,480
 And so as a result they had to change it to

534
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:29,240
 whether they win or lose you get a free Big Mac.

535
00:17:29,240 --> 00:17:30,440
 - Yeah they were terrible weren't they

536
00:17:30,440 --> 00:17:31,920
 when he first took over.

537
00:17:31,920 --> 00:17:32,760
 - Yeah.

538
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:34,280
 - Was there not a thing about him

539
00:17:34,280 --> 00:17:36,360
 shouting at them on the pitch or something like that?

540
00:17:36,360 --> 00:17:39,040
 - The first match he went, he was very excited

541
00:17:39,040 --> 00:17:41,720
 because the idea of him signing this new player

542
00:17:41,720 --> 00:17:43,440
 and the fact that Ray Crock had taken over it.

543
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:45,840
 He got the attendance right up.

544
00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:50,120
 They, for their opener, they drew 39,000 people

545
00:17:50,120 --> 00:17:51,960
 but they totally sucked in the match.

546
00:17:51,960 --> 00:17:53,760
 And as a result he went into the booth

547
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:55,960
 where the commentators were commentating on the match

548
00:17:55,960 --> 00:17:59,280
 took over the Tannoy and he said,

549
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:00,560
 "I have good news and bad news."

550
00:18:00,560 --> 00:18:03,000
 The good news is that the Dodgers drew 31,000

551
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:06,360
 for their opener and we've drawn 39,000 for ours.

552
00:18:06,360 --> 00:18:08,600
 The bad news is that this is the most stupid

553
00:18:08,600 --> 00:18:10,960
 baseball playing I have ever seen.

554
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:13,840
 He said that to the players heard the fans

555
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:15,440
 and the fans cheered, they loved it.

556
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:17,000
 They loved that he was being honest.

557
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,960
 And then someone ran on the field of Strieker

558
00:18:19,960 --> 00:18:21,920
 and he yelled, "Get that Strieker off the field.

559
00:18:21,920 --> 00:18:22,920
 "Throw him in jail."

560
00:18:22,920 --> 00:18:25,640
 So he was just commenting to the whole stadium

561
00:18:25,640 --> 00:18:27,920
 of 39,000 people his thoughts.

562
00:18:27,920 --> 00:18:28,760
 It was amazing.

563
00:18:28,760 --> 00:18:30,080
 - He was angry.

564
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:30,920
 - Yeah.

565
00:18:30,920 --> 00:18:33,720
 Just before we did this show in Bristol,

566
00:18:33,720 --> 00:18:35,480
 the night before, or the day before,

567
00:18:35,480 --> 00:18:39,160
 I watched the founder for research for this.

568
00:18:39,160 --> 00:18:41,640
 I was a really good film about Ray Crock

569
00:18:41,640 --> 00:18:43,160
 but I can't remember any of it now.

570
00:18:43,160 --> 00:18:44,000
 (laughing)

571
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:44,840
 - Good story.

572
00:18:44,840 --> 00:18:47,520
 - I think I remember is that when the brothers

573
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:50,840
 who founded McDonald's, so this is not Ray Crock,

574
00:18:50,840 --> 00:18:53,800
 their idea was called the method, I think.

575
00:18:53,800 --> 00:18:56,320
 And they worked out the size of their kitchen

576
00:18:56,320 --> 00:18:57,320
 and where everything went,

577
00:18:57,320 --> 00:18:59,200
 so there was a most efficient possible way

578
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:00,360
 of running a kitchen.

579
00:19:00,360 --> 00:19:02,880
 And the way they did it is they went to a tennis court

580
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:05,160
 and they had chalk and they drew all the different

581
00:19:05,160 --> 00:19:07,200
 possibilities and they got people,

582
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:09,320
 hired people for very little money

583
00:19:09,320 --> 00:19:12,160
 to try out pretending to cook all these burgers,

584
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:13,280
 pretending to do milkshakes,

585
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:16,520
 pretending to do fries until they got the exact one.

586
00:19:16,520 --> 00:19:18,560
 And they did this for days and days.

587
00:19:18,560 --> 00:19:20,400
 They eventually found the right one

588
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:22,800
 and then that night it rained

589
00:19:22,800 --> 00:19:25,080
 and all of their chalk marks got washed away

590
00:19:25,080 --> 00:19:26,560
 and they had to do the whole experiment.

591
00:19:26,560 --> 00:19:27,720
 - Oh no.

592
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:29,680
 - The whole sort of the design of the kitchen

593
00:19:29,680 --> 00:19:30,840
 like the choreography.

594
00:19:30,840 --> 00:19:31,680
 That's very cool.

595
00:19:31,680 --> 00:19:32,680
 - Oh wow.

596
00:19:32,680 --> 00:19:34,440
 - Do you know that Ray Crock was in the same

597
00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:36,200
 Ray Cross company in the first world war

598
00:19:36,200 --> 00:19:38,400
 driving ambulances as Walt Disney?

599
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:39,240
 - Wow.

600
00:19:39,240 --> 00:19:40,080
 - Was it really?

601
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:42,000
 - And they both went on to be very successful

602
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:46,680
 in their own ways, and they both lied about their age

603
00:19:46,680 --> 00:19:47,520
 to get in.

604
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:48,360
 - Really?

605
00:19:48,360 --> 00:19:49,200
 - Yeah.

606
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:51,000
 - He had a really weird relationship with his wife,

607
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:51,840
 didn't he?

608
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:52,680
 - Did he?

609
00:19:52,680 --> 00:19:53,520
 - Joan Crock.

610
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:56,360
 So she, Crock suddenly becomes a funny asser name

611
00:19:56,360 --> 00:19:58,200
 when he was actually a Joan.

612
00:19:58,200 --> 00:20:01,040
 So I think first of all they were married

613
00:20:01,040 --> 00:20:02,760
 when he said he wanted to buy the Padres

614
00:20:02,760 --> 00:20:05,280
 and she said is that a monastery?

615
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:08,240
 And then it seems like they must have had some tensions

616
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:11,480
 'cause first of all she launched an alcoholism charity

617
00:20:11,480 --> 00:20:13,800
 called Operation Cork, which is Crock,

618
00:20:13,800 --> 00:20:16,000
 his surname spelled backwards.

619
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,720
 And she used to produce TV dramas

620
00:20:17,720 --> 00:20:19,600
 about the impact of alcoholism on families

621
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:21,160
 'cause I think he was an alcoholic.

622
00:20:21,160 --> 00:20:23,600
 So she said she raised awareness about that.

623
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:27,280
 But also when he died in 1984 she immediately gave away

624
00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:29,560
 the estate and distributed all the money

625
00:20:29,560 --> 00:20:31,920
 to all these like some great charities.

626
00:20:31,920 --> 00:20:33,920
 And also she gave a million dollars

627
00:20:33,920 --> 00:20:36,640
 to the Democratic Party, which is a slap in the face

628
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:38,600
 because Ray Crock was a massive Republican.

629
00:20:38,600 --> 00:20:42,760
 He'd given like quarter of a million to Nixon's re-election campaign.

630
00:20:42,760 --> 00:20:47,480
 So yeah, she sort of undid his legacy in some ways.

631
00:20:47,480 --> 00:20:49,280
 - And she was amazing for the baseball team as well

632
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:51,280
 'cause after he passed away she took over

633
00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:53,160
 but she knew virtually nothing about baseball.

634
00:20:53,160 --> 00:20:55,320
 But in that first season after she took over

635
00:20:55,320 --> 00:20:57,080
 her team made it to the World Series.

636
00:20:57,080 --> 00:20:59,360
 - Well it seems like she knew a lot about baseball

637
00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:00,640
 on like her husband.

638
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:01,480
 (laughs)

639
00:21:01,480 --> 00:21:02,920
 - Well she learned, yeah she learned on the go,

640
00:21:02,920 --> 00:21:04,160
 yeah he definitely didn't like it.

641
00:21:04,160 --> 00:21:07,360
 He at one point after the Padres had lost 102 games

642
00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:09,680
 said I bought the team to have some fun

643
00:21:09,680 --> 00:21:12,040
 but it's proving to be about as enjoyable as a wake

644
00:21:12,040 --> 00:21:16,880
 your own, that was his public comment about his own team.

645
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:18,680
 - Your guy called Big Mac.

646
00:21:18,680 --> 00:21:19,520
 - Yeah.

647
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:20,920
 - I went on the internet and searched

648
00:21:20,920 --> 00:21:23,600
 for some other names of baseball players

649
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:27,200
 and I found that there was a guy called Thomas Lewis Fries

650
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:30,400
 and another one called Philip Douglas Koch.

651
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:34,640
 So you can have Big Mac fries and coke with the players.

652
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:39,640
 Some other players, Cannonball, Ticcom, Jolly Dick Shot.

653
00:21:39,640 --> 00:21:40,960
 - Lovely.

654
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:44,440
 - His nickname was Ugly so people called him Ugly Dick Shot

655
00:21:44,440 --> 00:21:46,760
 and Wonderful Mounds.

656
00:21:46,760 --> 00:21:47,600
 - No.

657
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:48,440
 - His name is nice.

658
00:21:48,440 --> 00:21:50,640
 - Wonderful, sorry that's a nickname surely.

659
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:51,880
 - His first name was Wonderful,

660
00:21:51,880 --> 00:21:53,920
 his second name was Terrific.

661
00:21:53,920 --> 00:21:55,160
 - What?

662
00:21:55,160 --> 00:21:56,000
 - No.

663
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:56,760
 - Wonderful Terrific.

664
00:21:56,760 --> 00:21:58,560
 - Actually Wonderful Mounds.

665
00:21:58,560 --> 00:21:59,400
 - Okay.

666
00:21:59,400 --> 00:22:01,920
 - I mean it wasn't the surname that I was quibbling with.

667
00:22:01,920 --> 00:22:03,440
 (laughs)

668
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:04,840
 - Wonderful Terrific Mounds.

669
00:22:04,840 --> 00:22:05,680
 That's a good name, isn't it?

670
00:22:05,680 --> 00:22:07,160
 - Yes, it's a lovely.

671
00:22:07,160 --> 00:22:10,200
 - Well there's a guy in basketball called Metaworld Peace.

672
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:11,920
 That's his name.

673
00:22:11,920 --> 00:22:13,040
 He's playing for China now

674
00:22:13,040 --> 00:22:15,040
 and he's changed his name to Panda.

675
00:22:15,040 --> 00:22:15,880
 - Okay.

676
00:22:15,880 --> 00:22:17,520
 - He just keeps going for the name changes.

677
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:20,200
 - This is an American footballer called Lion King.

678
00:22:20,200 --> 00:22:22,000
 - Sir, Lion King, first name Lion.

679
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:22,840
 - Yeah, cool.

680
00:22:22,840 --> 00:22:23,920
 - That's so good.

681
00:22:23,920 --> 00:22:26,720
 - Did you know chicken nuggets were almost onion nuggets?

682
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:28,520
 They trial the two, not realizing

683
00:22:28,520 --> 00:22:29,600
 that people might prefer chicken.

684
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:30,800
 They almost made them onions.

685
00:22:30,800 --> 00:22:32,600
 - That might be nice, like an onion bargie.

686
00:22:32,600 --> 00:22:33,440
 - I think so.

687
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:34,440
 - Or an onion ring.

688
00:22:34,440 --> 00:22:35,440
 - Yeah, absolutely.

689
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:37,320
 - It's like an onion ring, but it's an onion ball.

690
00:22:37,320 --> 00:22:38,320
 - Yeah, fine.

691
00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:40,080
 - It's like an onion bargie, in fact.

692
00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:41,240
 - Yeah, yeah.

693
00:22:41,240 --> 00:22:42,080
 (laughs)

694
00:22:42,080 --> 00:22:43,240
 Yeah.

695
00:22:43,240 --> 00:22:44,560
 There's a point.

696
00:22:44,560 --> 00:22:47,320
 Do you know there's a secret rebel McDonald's operating

697
00:22:47,320 --> 00:22:48,320
 in India?

698
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:49,840
 - Ah, this is very cool.

699
00:22:49,840 --> 00:22:50,840
 - I need to blow in their cover.

700
00:22:50,840 --> 00:22:52,600
 - Yeah, well sorry guys.

701
00:22:52,600 --> 00:22:56,120
 There was a big kerfuffle between McDonald's global

702
00:22:56,120 --> 00:22:57,640
 and the Indian version of McDonald's.

703
00:22:57,640 --> 00:22:59,760
 - Do they make chicken bargies?

704
00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:01,240
 - I don't know if they do.

705
00:23:01,240 --> 00:23:02,080
 I hope they do.

706
00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:04,240
 They do do a thing called McSpicy Peneer,

707
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:06,120
 which is very popular, it sells out every day,

708
00:23:06,120 --> 00:23:07,800
 but they canceled their franchise agreement

709
00:23:07,800 --> 00:23:09,160
 with 150 restaurants.

710
00:23:09,160 --> 00:23:12,600
 They said, "Oh, it's not working out for whatever reason."

711
00:23:12,600 --> 00:23:15,040
 And the restaurants kept on going, selling the food.

712
00:23:15,040 --> 00:23:15,880
 - Right.

713
00:23:15,880 --> 00:23:17,440
 - And no one stopped them or intervened.

714
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:19,440
 And they've left up the golden archers and everything,

715
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:21,040
 and they're still trading under the McDonald's name.

716
00:23:21,040 --> 00:23:21,880
 Yeah.

717
00:23:21,880 --> 00:23:23,880
 - Yeah, the archers aren't always golden.

718
00:23:23,880 --> 00:23:26,000
 There are a few exceptions,

719
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:29,520
 one of which is in Sedona in Arizona

720
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:32,960
 and their turquoise, why, get any guesses?

721
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:33,800
 Why?

722
00:23:33,800 --> 00:23:35,840
 - 'Cause the yellowness blends into the desert,

723
00:23:35,840 --> 00:23:36,840
 so you can't see it.

724
00:23:36,840 --> 00:23:37,680
 - Exactly.

725
00:23:37,680 --> 00:23:39,280
 - No, it was, it was actually said,

726
00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:41,320
 it sort of clashed too much with it.

727
00:23:41,320 --> 00:23:42,520
 - Oh, so the opposite.

728
00:23:42,520 --> 00:23:43,840
 - Yeah, but yeah.

729
00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:45,320
 You're the right kind of line.

730
00:23:45,320 --> 00:23:46,480
 So yeah, the government said,

731
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:48,560
 look, that kind of clashes with our desert.

732
00:23:48,560 --> 00:23:50,040
 It looks silly, do something else.

733
00:23:50,040 --> 00:23:50,880
 Yeah.

734
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:55,000
 - I read that the guy who created the golden archers

735
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:57,000
 was offered a deal very early on in the day

736
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:58,760
 of a cut of it forever on,

737
00:23:58,760 --> 00:24:01,320
 or a one off payment, which was a very low sum.

738
00:24:01,320 --> 00:24:02,920
 - They always take the very low sum.

739
00:24:02,920 --> 00:24:04,400
 - Yeah, they take the low sum.

740
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:05,640
 - They always go in and they say,

741
00:24:05,640 --> 00:24:07,240
 well, offer you this very low sum.

742
00:24:07,240 --> 00:24:09,640
 - I love you, money for the rest of your life

743
00:24:09,640 --> 00:24:10,600
 and they always take it.

744
00:24:10,600 --> 00:24:11,440
 - Yeah.

745
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:12,440
 - They never even specify the low sum, do they?

746
00:24:12,440 --> 00:24:14,600
 They just say, very low sum, do you want it?

747
00:24:14,600 --> 00:24:16,080
 (laughing)

748
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:18,660
 (upbeat music)

749
00:24:18,660 --> 00:24:24,560
 - Okay, it is time for a final fact of the show

750
00:24:24,560 --> 00:24:25,920
 and that is James.

751
00:24:25,920 --> 00:24:27,640
 - Okay, my fact this week is that

752
00:24:27,640 --> 00:24:32,640
 the yellow-billed ox-pecker bird sleeps in giraffe's armpits.

753
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:34,000
 - Mmm. - It's so cool.

754
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:34,840
 - Nice.

755
00:24:34,840 --> 00:24:35,840
 - We've known for a long time

756
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:38,600
 that they kind of hang out on these African animals

757
00:24:38,600 --> 00:24:41,720
 like giraffe and water buffalo and stuff like that.

758
00:24:41,720 --> 00:24:43,840
 But they've only just found out that they stay there

759
00:24:43,840 --> 00:24:45,440
 overnight as well.

760
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:48,480
 And that comes from a multi-year camera trap study

761
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:51,080
 in Tanzania, Serengeti National Park.

762
00:24:51,080 --> 00:24:53,600
 And so they're putting the cameras on these animals

763
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:54,440
 in the middle of the night

764
00:24:54,440 --> 00:24:56,600
 and they found that the birds stay there.

765
00:24:56,600 --> 00:24:58,600
 And it seems that usually they stay there

766
00:24:58,600 --> 00:25:00,680
 and they have this symbiotic relationship

767
00:25:00,680 --> 00:25:02,440
 where they eat all the little bugs

768
00:25:02,440 --> 00:25:04,720
 that live in the giraffe's armpits

769
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:07,240
 and they get the protection of the giraffe.

770
00:25:07,240 --> 00:25:09,200
 - Not just the armpits as well.

771
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:10,920
 - Yes. - The legs, it's all the pits.

772
00:25:10,920 --> 00:25:13,880
 - The crotch is crotch every one of the pits.

773
00:25:13,880 --> 00:25:16,040
 - Okay, so you can get up to seven birds

774
00:25:16,040 --> 00:25:17,480
 in a single crotch.

775
00:25:17,480 --> 00:25:18,640
 (laughing)

776
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:19,640
 - That was that.

777
00:25:19,640 --> 00:25:20,960
 A YouTube video we used to watch

778
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:22,160
 in the first year of uni, I think,

779
00:25:22,160 --> 00:25:24,320
 so the birds are one crotch, yeah.

780
00:25:24,320 --> 00:25:26,880
 (laughing)

781
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:28,800
 But it's really good, the giraffes are great.

782
00:25:28,800 --> 00:25:30,280
 They're great beds because they're off the ground,

783
00:25:30,280 --> 00:25:31,840
 meaning you're a bit safer as a bird,

784
00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:34,520
 whereas buffalo lie down and they're unstable.

785
00:25:34,520 --> 00:25:35,520
 Giraffes stable.

786
00:25:35,520 --> 00:25:36,880
 - Wait, except when a giraffe sleeps,

787
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:38,280
 because they've been seen in the wild

788
00:25:38,280 --> 00:25:39,880
 to be sleeping while laying down.

789
00:25:39,880 --> 00:25:41,920
 And what they do is they bend around

790
00:25:41,920 --> 00:25:43,880
 and they use their butt as a pillow.

791
00:25:43,880 --> 00:25:45,680
 So they bring their head right around

792
00:25:45,680 --> 00:25:47,520
 and rest it on the top of their butt.

793
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:48,360
 - That's nice.

794
00:25:48,360 --> 00:25:50,160
 - So I would say the best thing about being a giraffe,

795
00:25:50,160 --> 00:25:51,480
 actually, you can do that.

796
00:25:51,480 --> 00:25:52,320
 - It must be right.

797
00:25:52,320 --> 00:25:53,920
 I mean, we would all kill to do that.

798
00:25:53,920 --> 00:25:57,160
 But oxpeckers, they eat the little animals,

799
00:25:57,160 --> 00:25:59,800
 but they also eat the host bodily fluids,

800
00:25:59,800 --> 00:26:02,320
 including mucus, blood and snot,

801
00:26:02,320 --> 00:26:05,000
 and even the goop that you get in your eyes.

802
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:05,840
 - Yeah.

803
00:26:05,840 --> 00:26:08,520
 - They also like to live on zebras.

804
00:26:08,520 --> 00:26:12,240
 And I read one article, I'll just read a bit of it.

805
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:14,040
 Still in its statue-like pose,

806
00:26:14,040 --> 00:26:15,960
 the zebra raised its tail quickly

807
00:26:15,960 --> 00:26:17,920
 and held it out behind its body.

808
00:26:17,920 --> 00:26:20,200
 The oxpecker immediately scuttled down

809
00:26:20,200 --> 00:26:22,560
 onto the hairless black shiny skin

810
00:26:22,560 --> 00:26:25,000
 that surrounds the zebra's anal region

811
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:27,280
 and worked this area assiduously.

812
00:26:27,280 --> 00:26:30,560
 - Sounds like an extract from six birds one crotch.

813
00:26:30,560 --> 00:26:32,800
 (laughing)

814
00:26:32,800 --> 00:26:34,400
 - Ooh, I've got a fact about symbiotic

815
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:36,080
 analist relationships.

816
00:26:36,080 --> 00:26:36,920
 - Right.

817
00:26:36,920 --> 00:26:39,520
 - So there's a kind of leech called plackob,

818
00:26:39,520 --> 00:26:43,560
 plackob deloidies, jager skeoldi,

819
00:26:43,560 --> 00:26:46,160
 which is a leech, which lives inside hippo anuses.

820
00:26:46,160 --> 00:26:49,320
 It spends most of its life, in fact, inside a hippo's bottom.

821
00:26:49,320 --> 00:26:51,400
 And they live for about 2.6 years.

822
00:26:51,400 --> 00:26:54,480
 So they were covered in the new scientist in 1995

823
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:57,200
 and the headline was, "Leech rides the tunnel of love."

824
00:26:57,200 --> 00:26:59,800
 'Cause it's safe from oxpeckers, actually.

825
00:26:59,800 --> 00:27:02,280
 It's safer if you go right into the bottom

826
00:27:02,280 --> 00:27:05,040
 and they have to swim into a hippo's bottom to have sex.

827
00:27:05,040 --> 00:27:08,040
 - Do they swim into it or do they just crawl into it?

828
00:27:08,040 --> 00:27:09,280
 - I think when the hippo is-

829
00:27:09,280 --> 00:27:10,120
 - Under water?

830
00:27:10,120 --> 00:27:10,960
 - Under water, I swear I'm in.

831
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:12,600
 But it has special tools designed

832
00:27:12,600 --> 00:27:14,520
 to push open a hippo's sphincter.

833
00:27:14,520 --> 00:27:16,760
 - When you say tools, it's part of its body.

834
00:27:16,760 --> 00:27:18,080
 - It's part of its body, yeah.

835
00:27:18,080 --> 00:27:19,920
 - I think it's a little shovel.

836
00:27:19,920 --> 00:27:21,560
 (laughing)

837
00:27:21,560 --> 00:27:25,320
 - One really cool symbiotic relationship, I quite like.

838
00:27:25,320 --> 00:27:26,560
 Crabbs and urchins.

839
00:27:26,560 --> 00:27:28,640
 - Oh yeah. - So I didn't know about this, but-

840
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:31,480
 - I hope we talk about Victorian street children here.

841
00:27:31,480 --> 00:27:33,840
 We're not gonna be very disappointed.

842
00:27:33,840 --> 00:27:35,320
 - And Jen, it's a lice, I hope.

843
00:27:35,320 --> 00:27:36,640
 (laughing)

844
00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:37,720
 - Of course.

845
00:27:37,720 --> 00:27:38,960
 - Cool, Blimey, Gavna.

846
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:40,640
 So you're crab-proof-harving.

847
00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:42,320
 (laughing)

848
00:27:42,320 --> 00:27:44,080
 - Spot scratching your crotch, Dodger.

849
00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:47,080
 (laughing)

850
00:27:47,080 --> 00:27:48,520
 - No, it's neither of those things.

851
00:27:48,520 --> 00:27:51,400
 I see urchins and it's just crabs, like normal crabs.

852
00:27:51,400 --> 00:27:53,680
 And so urchins travel on the back of crabs,

853
00:27:53,680 --> 00:27:55,640
 which is useful for them, as it means they can travel.

854
00:27:55,640 --> 00:27:57,400
 So urchins can't really travel very well otherwise.

855
00:27:57,400 --> 00:27:58,240
 - See the world?

856
00:27:58,240 --> 00:28:00,360
 - Exactly, get out there, take some photos.

857
00:28:00,360 --> 00:28:01,200
 - On the gap, yeah.

858
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:02,040
 (laughing)

859
00:28:02,040 --> 00:28:04,880
 - Right, some urchin postcards, but it's good for the crab

860
00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:07,280
 because they can suddenly use it as a disguise

861
00:28:07,280 --> 00:28:08,800
 or a weapon if they need to.

862
00:28:08,800 --> 00:28:11,520
 So they can sometimes get the urchin down with their claw

863
00:28:11,520 --> 00:28:12,880
 or face something with the urchin

864
00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:14,840
 and act like they've got a really awesome spiky back.

865
00:28:14,840 --> 00:28:15,680
 - Yeah, wow.

866
00:28:15,680 --> 00:28:16,960
 - I've got another one, just while we're on

867
00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:20,280
 the symbiotic relationship role, there's an ant,

868
00:28:20,280 --> 00:28:23,720
 which is called Campanosa Schmitze, which is a great name.

869
00:28:23,720 --> 00:28:26,640
 And it only lives on a single species of pitcher plant.

870
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:30,400
 You know, pitcher plants, they're the ones that consume prey

871
00:28:30,400 --> 00:28:32,280
 by, I think they fall into, they drown.

872
00:28:32,280 --> 00:28:33,120
 - Yeah.

873
00:28:33,120 --> 00:28:33,960
 - So they look like a chum.

874
00:28:33,960 --> 00:28:34,800
 - Yeah, yeah.

875
00:28:34,800 --> 00:28:35,640
 - Oh wow.

876
00:28:35,640 --> 00:28:38,760
 - But the ants swim around in the digestive fluids

877
00:28:38,760 --> 00:28:41,360
 of the plant, they consume the nectar of the plant

878
00:28:41,360 --> 00:28:44,240
 and they also consume some of the prey that the plant eats,

879
00:28:44,240 --> 00:28:46,320
 but the plants which have ants swimming around

880
00:28:46,320 --> 00:28:48,880
 in their stomachs, basically, get bigger than those

881
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:51,920
 which don't have them because the ants keep the traps clean

882
00:28:51,920 --> 00:28:54,600
 and they hunt mosquito larvae, which would otherwise

883
00:28:54,600 --> 00:28:56,440
 soak up more nutrients.

884
00:28:56,440 --> 00:28:58,280
 So it's beneficial to, if you're a pitcher plant,

885
00:28:58,280 --> 00:28:59,960
 to have ants in your stomach.

886
00:28:59,960 --> 00:29:02,480
 And the plants also eat the ants poo.

887
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:04,320
 - Nice, as well as eating the ants.

888
00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:06,360
 - They don't eat the ants, the ants survive in there,

889
00:29:06,360 --> 00:29:07,960
 the ants are tolerated within the system.

890
00:29:07,960 --> 00:29:09,600
 - Yeah, you get some pitcher plants, don't you,

891
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:11,680
 where you get little shrews who sit on the,

892
00:29:11,680 --> 00:29:13,440
 on the side of them and then poo into them

893
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:15,560
 just like little toilets.

894
00:29:15,560 --> 00:29:18,200
 Yeah, and they eat the nitrogen of those.

895
00:29:18,200 --> 00:29:19,760
 - What's the benefit for the shrew,

896
00:29:19,760 --> 00:29:20,760
 'cause they don't mind where they poo.

897
00:29:20,760 --> 00:29:23,000
 - Just gets a toilet, you know, for dinner.

898
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:23,840
 - Is that enjoyable?

899
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:24,680
 'Cause they--

900
00:29:24,680 --> 00:29:26,720
 - Yeah, yes, 'cause it can sit there reading its iPhone.

901
00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:27,560
 - Okay, that makes sense.

902
00:29:27,560 --> 00:29:29,880
 - It's beneficial, you wouldn't like it

903
00:29:29,880 --> 00:29:32,080
 if we took away your toilet from you, Dan.

904
00:29:32,080 --> 00:29:34,560
 But if the concept of toilets didn't exist for us,

905
00:29:34,560 --> 00:29:36,080
 I would just poo here right now.

906
00:29:36,080 --> 00:29:37,480
 - They've now got the concept of toilets,

907
00:29:37,480 --> 00:29:38,920
 so they have to go as a pitcher plant.

908
00:29:38,920 --> 00:29:40,760
 - They don't, I mean, Dan's also very sick of question here.

909
00:29:40,760 --> 00:29:41,760
 What is going on?

910
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:43,640
 - No animal understands the importance

911
00:29:43,640 --> 00:29:46,120
 of a good sewerage system except humans.

912
00:29:46,120 --> 00:29:49,440
 One earth is a shrew clamping up at the top of the flower

913
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:52,080
 in order to take a shit where I was just doing it all around.

914
00:29:52,080 --> 00:29:55,760
 - I think what happens is it eats something from the flower,

915
00:29:55,760 --> 00:29:57,440
 maybe some nectar or something,

916
00:29:57,440 --> 00:30:01,520
 and that is a laxative, and then that makes it poo.

917
00:30:01,520 --> 00:30:02,520
 I believe that's true.

918
00:30:02,520 --> 00:30:03,960
 - So it almost can't get out in time.

919
00:30:03,960 --> 00:30:05,200
 It's kind of like a zine or something,

920
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:06,200
 and it sort of has to poo in the shower.

921
00:30:06,200 --> 00:30:07,520
 - It's like a delicious restaurant,

922
00:30:07,520 --> 00:30:09,560
 but with very bad hygiene standards.

923
00:30:09,560 --> 00:30:13,920
 But then they use your poo to power the electricity.

924
00:30:13,920 --> 00:30:14,760
 - Oh, wow.

925
00:30:14,760 --> 00:30:15,920
 - Where is this restaurant?

926
00:30:15,920 --> 00:30:18,560
 - I feel a start-up coming on.

927
00:30:18,560 --> 00:30:22,200
 - Hey, I've got something on armpits.

928
00:30:22,200 --> 00:30:24,000
 In the 19th century in Austria,

929
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:27,000
 there used to be the thing where, at Dancers,

930
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:30,120
 women would carry underneath their armpits

931
00:30:30,120 --> 00:30:32,440
 a single slice of apple,

932
00:30:32,440 --> 00:30:34,240
 and they would hold it there all night long,

933
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:36,040
 and the idea was at the end of the night,

934
00:30:36,040 --> 00:30:38,600
 the girl would approach someone who they'd fancy

935
00:30:38,600 --> 00:30:41,000
 to guy if it was a guy that they fancy.

936
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:42,640
 They would go up and they would take the apple out,

937
00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:43,640
 and they would present the apple.

938
00:30:43,640 --> 00:30:45,600
 - They still do that on Love Island, I think, do they?

939
00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:47,440
 (all laughing)

940
00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:48,440
 - I think I'm sure.

941
00:30:48,440 --> 00:30:50,840
 - So it was sent to the guy, and if the guy eats it,

942
00:30:50,840 --> 00:30:52,440
 he's saying, "I'm keen."

943
00:30:52,440 --> 00:30:53,280
 - Yeah.

944
00:30:53,280 --> 00:30:54,120
 - Wow.

945
00:30:54,120 --> 00:30:55,720
 And is there any way for him to say,

946
00:30:55,720 --> 00:30:57,720
 "I'm keen without eating the armpit."

947
00:30:57,720 --> 00:31:00,240
 - But I think if you're not willing to eat the apple

948
00:31:00,240 --> 00:31:02,120
 that's been inside the armpit of your loved one,

949
00:31:02,120 --> 00:31:03,280
 you don't love her at all.

950
00:31:03,280 --> 00:31:04,640
 - You're not keen enough.

951
00:31:04,640 --> 00:31:07,160
 So women's armpits smell of onion,

952
00:31:07,160 --> 00:31:09,040
 and men's smell of cheese, apparently.

953
00:31:09,040 --> 00:31:09,880
 And this is--

954
00:31:09,880 --> 00:31:12,160
 - Well, between us, we can have a delicious bag of crisps.

955
00:31:12,160 --> 00:31:14,200
 (all laughing)

956
00:31:14,200 --> 00:31:16,480
 - You know those like salt and shake crisps

957
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:18,480
 that you used to get where they don't taste of anything,

958
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:19,320
 but you have to put your own--

959
00:31:19,320 --> 00:31:20,160
 - Yeah, absolutely.

960
00:31:20,160 --> 00:31:23,040
 - Are you proposing that you scissors someone else's armpit

961
00:31:23,040 --> 00:31:24,400
 with one crisp in the middle,

962
00:31:24,400 --> 00:31:25,720
 and you're gonna lovely cheese and onion--

963
00:31:25,720 --> 00:31:27,160
 - I'm gonna go to an Austrian dance.

964
00:31:27,160 --> 00:31:29,160
 (all laughing)

965
00:31:29,160 --> 00:31:31,320
 - I think it doesn't cost any more just to buy cheese

966
00:31:31,320 --> 00:31:33,080
 and onion rather than just buying cheese

967
00:31:33,080 --> 00:31:35,320
 and then wiping it up against a woman's armpit.

968
00:31:35,320 --> 00:31:36,160
 - That's true.

969
00:31:36,160 --> 00:31:37,000
 - I don't see why you would.

970
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:39,400
 - Those crisps, they used to be the same price

971
00:31:39,400 --> 00:31:40,880
 as ready salted crisps,

972
00:31:40,880 --> 00:31:42,520
 but you still had to put extra work in.

973
00:31:42,520 --> 00:31:43,360
 - That's so weird.

974
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:44,200
 - It was fun.

975
00:31:44,200 --> 00:31:45,040
 - Yeah, it was fun.

976
00:31:45,040 --> 00:31:46,840
 - But this is about compounds in their armpits,

977
00:31:46,840 --> 00:31:48,480
 by the way, this isn't just people sniffing them

978
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:49,920
 and saying, "Oh, that's oniony."

979
00:31:49,920 --> 00:31:50,760
 - Okay.

980
00:31:50,760 --> 00:31:53,400
 - This is the compound that women's armpits generate

981
00:31:53,400 --> 00:31:55,200
 is something called as a thio alcohol,

982
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:57,800
 which when it combines with a bacteria smells like onion,

983
00:31:57,800 --> 00:31:58,800
 and then men's sweat has--

984
00:31:58,800 --> 00:32:00,560
 - Would you say alcohol?

985
00:32:00,560 --> 00:32:03,280
 - Yeah, but don't go licking women's armpits for that.

986
00:32:03,280 --> 00:32:05,320
 Again, it's not worth it, I'll buy you a beer.

987
00:32:05,320 --> 00:32:07,160
 (laughing)

988
00:32:07,160 --> 00:32:09,740
 (upbeat music)

989
00:32:09,740 --> 00:32:14,080
 - Okay, that's it, that is all of our facts.

990
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:15,720
