00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.840
 (percussive music)

00:00:02.840 --> 00:00:17.440
 - Hey everyone, welcome to this week's episode of Fish.

00:00:17.440 --> 00:00:19.600
 Before we get going, just wanna let you know,

00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:20.880
 thank you for all your feedback

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:23.560
 about last week's ultimate crossover episode.

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:24.880
 It was very enjoyable to do.

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:28.000
 In fact, so much so, we've decided to do it again.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.280
 Except this time, we've decided to crossover completely,

00:00:31.280 --> 00:00:34.640
 a full crossover, a 360 crossover.

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:36.920
 - Done, we messed up again, didn't we?

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:41.920
 - We lost an entire episode, somehow.

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:45.080
 - So if you were in Bristol a few months ago,

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:46.840
 quite a few months ago, you will have seen

00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:48.000
 an amazing show, guys.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.520
 I gotta tell you, this was one of the best shows we ever did.

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:52.880
 Unfortunately, it doesn't seem like we recorded it.

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:55.320
 - So only you, Bristolians, will have the memory

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:56.480
 of that show.

00:00:56.480 --> 00:00:59.920
 And then this is kind of the lesser version, you say?

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:00.760
 - Yeah.

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:01.760
 - Oh, it's still worth listening to.

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:02.600
 - I would say.

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:05.080
 Definitely one for the completest, I'd say.

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:06.600
 - Yes.

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:08.680
 - Yeah, it's amazing how negative you guys are.

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:10.000
 We haven't even recorded it yet.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:11.600
 (all laughing)

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:13.560
 - So enjoy this week's episode.

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:14.400
 Here we go.

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:15.800
 (upbeat music)

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:19.080
 Hello and welcome to another episode of No Such Thing

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:21.360
 as a Fish, a weekly podcast coming to you

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:23.800
 from the QI offices in Covert Garden.

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:26.120
 My name is Dan Schreiber, and I'm sitting here

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:29.960
 with Andrew Hunter Murray, James Harkin, and Anna Chazinski.

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:32.280
 And once again, we have gathered around the microphones

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:35.400
 with our four favorite facts from the last seven days.

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:38.160
 And in a particular order, here we go.

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:40.440
 Starting with you, Andy.

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:43.240
 - Okay, my fact is, it's about Bristol, actually.

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:44.800
 I've just chosen completely at random

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:46.720
 out of all the cities I could have chosen.

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:48.400
 And I learned it about four months ago,

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:50.600
 shortly before we performed in Bristol.

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:53.960
 My fact this week is that the first hot air balloon flight

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:56.120
 in Bristol was indoors.

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:59.440
 And people at home have to imagine

00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:01.480
 the cheers and laughter of the Bristol crowd

00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:02.480
 when they first heard that.

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:04.720
 - They went nuts when Andy said that.

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:06.080
 My God.

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:08.200
 - So there's this firm in Bristol called Cameron Balloons,

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:09.960
 and it's the world's biggest balloon firm.

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:12.520
 Basically, Bristol is the capital of hot air ballooning

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:14.560
 pretty much in the world, definitely in the UK.

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:15.400
 - Yep.

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:17.800
 - And the first flight was in 1784,

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:20.160
 and you had to go indoors to see it.

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:22.120
 And you had to pay a little amount to see it.

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:24.240
 And if you paid more, apparently you could see it filled up

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:25.080
 with air.

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:26.920
 - Apparently it was a pricing structural way.

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:27.760
 - Wait a minute.

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:29.160
 So the people who didn't pay much,

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:30.920
 they just saw a load of canvas.

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:32.920
 - It sounds like that, doesn't it?

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:34.200
 I can't quite believe that, that's true.

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:35.600
 - Was this new to people at the time?

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:40.080
 As in, how long did Balloons exist before this happens?

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:41.080
 - That's a great question.

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:41.920
 - Really good question.

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:44.720
 - So they had the Aztecs.

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:48.040
 They had, they made like Balloons

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:50.200
 out of animal intestines.

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:51.880
 I think we know that.

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:54.920
 And I remember reading once that they made Balloon animals

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:55.920
 out of those intestines.

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:57.400
 (laughing)

00:02:57.400 --> 00:03:00.280
 But I don't know if that doesn't sound very true, does it?

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:02.840
 - So, I mean, how big were the animals back then?

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:03.680
 - What do you mean?

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:05.240
 - As in, do they make like a full hot air balloon out

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:06.080
 of an animal?

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:06.920
 - No, no, no, sorry.

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:09.320
 So just Balloons in general, I'm saying about the history

00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:11.000
 of not the history of hot air balloons.

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:12.960
 (laughing)

00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:14.960
 - And the Civil War, they definitely had hot air balloons

00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:18.600
 'cause Lincoln had a hot air balloon balloon corp.

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:19.440
 Corps.

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:20.280
 - Cool.

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:21.120
 - Corps.

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:24.360
 - Just keep throwing guesses at the letters that you see.

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:25.440
 - Corps.

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:26.440
 - Corps.

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:27.720
 (laughing)

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:30.480
 - Yeah, he had a balloon corp and they had seven Balloons

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:33.320
 and they used to go over and the Confederates actually

00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:35.960
 tried to build their own Balloons in retaliation

00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:36.920
 and then they stopped doing them

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:39.000
 because people found them really easy to shoot.

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:40.480
 It was quite an easy target.

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:42.480
 So we know it goes back as far as the Civil War

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:43.960
 in America, at least.

00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:45.720
 - Yeah, they were actually a huge deal

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:47.800
 in the 19th century hot air balloon flights.

00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:50.720
 And I think in 1897 there was an attempt

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:52.440
 to reach the North Pole by balloon.

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:54.560
 That was three Swedish people who tried to get there.

00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:55.400
 They disappeared.

00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:56.520
 No one knew what happened to them.

00:03:56.520 --> 00:03:58.720
 There were these reports of silk falling from the sky.

00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:01.720
 And then randomly in 1930, 33 years later,

00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:04.760
 they were found in this Thor by Whalers just by chance.

00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:08.240
 They found as the Thor came the bodies of these guys

00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:09.960
 and they'd crashed after three days

00:04:09.960 --> 00:04:11.560
 but they'd lived on these ice flows

00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:13.520
 and they'd eaten polar bears for--

00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:16.120
 - Wow, that is hard cars, yeah.

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:16.960
 - That's amazing.

00:04:16.960 --> 00:04:19.480
 - I reckon I'd go hungry before I decided to go for

00:04:19.480 --> 00:04:21.480
 - Oh, look at that.

00:04:21.480 --> 00:04:22.920
 - It was so sad though, 'cause they were convinced

00:04:22.920 --> 00:04:26.080
 that they could steer their balloon over the North Pole.

00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:28.160
 And it was partly funded by Alfred Nobel.

00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:29.720
 Their attempt, yeah.

00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:32.800
 And but unfortunately the drag ropes didn't work very well

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:34.400
 and in a few minutes they fell off

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:35.920
 so they had no way of steering.

00:04:35.920 --> 00:04:37.360
 So they lost lots of ballast

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:39.080
 and they kept on just bumping along the ground

00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:41.120
 and leaking a bit and then rising a bit.

00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:43.440
 And it took them 65 hours to land

00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:45.040
 and they didn't get to the stores in time.

00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:46.040
 So it was sad.

00:04:46.040 --> 00:04:47.560
 - The other thing about eating polar bears

00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:49.840
 is their liver's contained so much vitamin A

00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:51.160
 that they're poisonous.

00:04:51.160 --> 00:04:52.000
 - Yeah, that's awful.

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:54.000
 If you're diving vitamin A poisoning,

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:55.880
 want to survive the hot air balloon crash

00:04:55.880 --> 00:04:57.920
 onto an ice flow and then pour a polar bear

00:04:57.920 --> 00:04:59.760
 to death with your bare hands.

00:04:59.760 --> 00:05:02.920
 - This is quite cool about higher balloons.

00:05:02.920 --> 00:05:05.920
 So usually you're not allowed to fly in rain

00:05:05.920 --> 00:05:08.520
 and so it's all weather dependent, isn't it,

00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:09.800
 if anyone tries to fly.

00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:11.440
 They can't actually fly in wet weather.

00:05:11.440 --> 00:05:13.000
 I guess it's just not recommended.

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:15.160
 But when you do fly in wet weather,

00:05:15.160 --> 00:05:16.360
 the rain gets caught in

00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:19.720
 and actually goes over the people inside the basket

00:05:19.720 --> 00:05:22.080
 so it makes its way into the...

00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:23.400
 But because of the flames,

00:05:23.400 --> 00:05:25.840
 it comes down like a hot shower.

00:05:25.840 --> 00:05:28.680
 So it's really warm water that drops on them.

00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:31.240
 - That's nice. - Yeah, that's very cool.

00:05:31.240 --> 00:05:33.000
 Have you heard of splash and dash?

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:35.240
 While we're talking about water and hot air ballooning?

00:05:35.240 --> 00:05:36.080
 - No.

00:05:36.080 --> 00:05:36.920
 - Splash and dash is a cool thing you can do

00:05:36.920 --> 00:05:38.120
 if you have a hot air balloon.

00:05:38.120 --> 00:05:39.760
 It's what you sink just low enough

00:05:39.760 --> 00:05:42.680
 to dip your toes into a lake and then climb up again.

00:05:42.680 --> 00:05:43.520
 - Oh cool.

00:05:43.520 --> 00:05:44.360
 - It's pretty risky.

00:05:44.360 --> 00:05:46.600
 - Your toe is below the bottom of the basket.

00:05:46.600 --> 00:05:49.160
 - Well, there is a trend for ballooning

00:05:49.160 --> 00:05:50.760
 with no basket these days.

00:05:50.760 --> 00:05:52.200
 - No way. - You have a sofa.

00:05:52.200 --> 00:05:53.320
 - You have a sofa.

00:05:53.320 --> 00:05:54.160
 - What?

00:05:54.160 --> 00:05:55.000
 - Yeah.

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:56.000
 - No way.

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:56.840
 - No way.

00:05:56.840 --> 00:05:58.720
 - It's not very common.

00:05:58.720 --> 00:05:59.960
 - It's a trend though.

00:05:59.960 --> 00:06:01.600
 - It's a trend.

00:06:01.600 --> 00:06:03.160
 - You're serious people can go up in a sofa,

00:06:03.160 --> 00:06:04.840
 do they have to be strapped in, right?

00:06:04.840 --> 00:06:09.240
 - I think it's really recommended that you try something.

00:06:09.240 --> 00:06:10.080
 - I don't know though,

00:06:10.080 --> 00:06:12.160
 because I never fall enough myselfer.

00:06:12.160 --> 00:06:13.000
 - That's true.

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:16.000
 - I mean, I don't know if that's true, but you look to me

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:17.320
 like the kind of guy who wouldn't.

00:06:17.320 --> 00:06:20.400
 - They protect the things that are easy to kind of sail.

00:06:20.400 --> 00:06:21.400
 - That's true, yeah?

00:06:21.400 --> 00:06:23.960
 - No, if it's swinging in high winds from a balloon

00:06:23.960 --> 00:06:25.680
 as a thousand feet up,

00:06:25.680 --> 00:06:27.480
 I don't have belts on my sofa,

00:06:27.480 --> 00:06:29.280
 so I think mine wouldn't be safe at all.

00:06:29.280 --> 00:06:31.520
 - Well, I've had belts fitted to all my soapers at home

00:06:31.520 --> 00:06:32.920
 and just in case,

00:06:32.920 --> 00:06:35.440
 and they save my life on countless occasions.

00:06:35.440 --> 00:06:38.880
 Well, speaking of no baskets for a hot air balloon,

00:06:38.880 --> 00:06:43.400
 have you heard of, they're called smoke hot air balloons?

00:06:43.400 --> 00:06:46.160
 It was a carnival attraction that used to happen.

00:06:46.160 --> 00:06:48.040
 So this is during the 1800s,

00:06:48.040 --> 00:06:49.880
 and there's footage that you can see of this online,

00:06:49.880 --> 00:06:51.040
 and it's honestly incredible.

00:06:51.040 --> 00:06:53.480
 This was a daredevil thing.

00:06:53.480 --> 00:06:55.520
 So what they would do is,

00:06:55.520 --> 00:06:58.600
 daredevil's would attach themselves by a rope

00:06:58.600 --> 00:07:01.080
 to an inflating hot air balloon with no baskets,

00:07:01.080 --> 00:07:02.400
 so simply the balloon.

00:07:02.400 --> 00:07:05.000
 So the balloon would completely fill up.

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:05.920
 They would untether it,

00:07:05.920 --> 00:07:07.760
 and it would rock it off into the sky,

00:07:07.760 --> 00:07:10.160
 and these people would just be dragged behind it

00:07:10.160 --> 00:07:11.280
 on the end of the ropes,

00:07:11.280 --> 00:07:13.320
 and would fly up after it.

00:07:13.320 --> 00:07:14.840
 And when they got to a certain height,

00:07:14.840 --> 00:07:17.960
 they would loosen themselves from the rope,

00:07:17.960 --> 00:07:20.200
 fall down and parachute back to Earth.

00:07:20.200 --> 00:07:22.200
 - Very cool. - Well, it's absolutely incredible.

00:07:22.200 --> 00:07:23.640
 You see them lob up in these people.

00:07:23.640 --> 00:07:25.480
 They're surrounded by people in the videos,

00:07:25.480 --> 00:07:28.360
 and they just go fong and disappear off into the air.

00:07:28.360 --> 00:07:30.440
 - But you have to loosen yourself up before it gets too high,

00:07:30.440 --> 00:07:32.280
 presumably. - Yeah, I think you obviously know

00:07:32.280 --> 00:07:33.720
 when it's you've had enough.

00:07:33.720 --> 00:07:34.880
 - Okay. - Yeah.

00:07:34.880 --> 00:07:38.080
 - I thought you were going to say they shot the balloon down.

00:07:38.080 --> 00:07:38.920
 Why?

00:07:38.920 --> 00:07:41.320
 (laughing)

00:07:41.320 --> 00:07:43.600
 'Cause I didn't imagine that they had a parachute on

00:07:43.600 --> 00:07:44.600
 when you were describing it.

00:07:44.600 --> 00:07:46.880
 So I was thinking how would I get myself out of this one?

00:07:46.880 --> 00:07:47.720
 - Yeah.

00:07:47.720 --> 00:07:49.960
 - And I would have, my first choice would have been a gun

00:07:49.960 --> 00:07:51.280
 instead of a parachute.

00:07:51.280 --> 00:07:53.200
 (laughing)

00:07:53.200 --> 00:07:55.560
 - What one item do you want to take up from you?

00:07:55.560 --> 00:07:57.640
 (laughing)

00:07:57.640 --> 00:07:59.440
 - I read a brilliant account.

00:07:59.440 --> 00:08:01.280
 This is actually the source of 1838,

00:08:01.280 --> 00:08:03.880
 but it was about something that happened in 1785,

00:08:03.880 --> 00:08:05.640
 and it was when Jean-Pierre Blanchard,

00:08:05.640 --> 00:08:07.640
 who was one of the first people to go up in a hot air balloon,

00:08:07.640 --> 00:08:10.160
 went up, he went 6,000 feet up,

00:08:10.160 --> 00:08:12.360
 and then he dropped from his hot air balloon,

00:08:12.360 --> 00:08:14.640
 a dog attached to a parachute,

00:08:14.640 --> 00:08:16.400
 just to kind of see what would happen,

00:08:16.400 --> 00:08:19.720
 and this whirlwind apparently swept the dog away

00:08:19.720 --> 00:08:22.280
 above the clouds, so it kind of disappeared,

00:08:22.280 --> 00:08:24.320
 and Blanchard is in his balloon.

00:08:24.320 --> 00:08:27.840
 This is what the account says, handed down through the ages.

00:08:27.840 --> 00:08:29.120
 Blanchard was in his balloon,

00:08:29.120 --> 00:08:32.600
 and he met the dog in his parachute above the clouds.

00:08:32.600 --> 00:08:33.440
 - This is rubbish.

00:08:33.440 --> 00:08:35.240
 - Do you remember that thing with that sauce?

00:08:35.240 --> 00:08:36.080
 (laughing)

00:08:36.080 --> 00:08:37.360
 - He got the loop the loop guy.

00:08:37.360 --> 00:08:38.440
 - Yeah, which is true.

00:08:38.440 --> 00:08:40.360
 - He fell out of his plane during a loop the loop,

00:08:40.360 --> 00:08:43.120
 and then fell back into it once it had finished doing the loop.

00:08:43.120 --> 00:08:45.880
 - Yeah, so he was upside down, he fell down,

00:08:45.880 --> 00:08:47.040
 he thought he was doomed,

00:08:47.040 --> 00:08:48.720
 but his plane, which was mid-loop the loop,

00:08:48.720 --> 00:08:50.160
 met him at the bottom.

00:08:50.160 --> 00:08:52.200
 - So remember how obviously fells that was?

00:08:52.200 --> 00:08:53.640
 - Look, your thing sounds similar.

00:08:53.640 --> 00:08:55.080
 - Dan's defies physics.

00:08:55.080 --> 00:08:57.040
 Mine, imagine a really small dog,

00:08:57.040 --> 00:08:59.880
 like a little terrier, with a parachute in high winds.

00:08:59.880 --> 00:09:01.960
 It could be swept away into the clouds,

00:09:01.960 --> 00:09:04.680
 and then old Blanchard saw his dog above the clouds,

00:09:04.680 --> 00:09:07.280
 who barked with joy apparently at seeing his master.

00:09:07.280 --> 00:09:08.360
 He tried to grab him,

00:09:08.360 --> 00:09:10.400
 and they both had landed 12 minutes later,

00:09:10.400 --> 00:09:12.520
 separately after which the dog ran away.

00:09:12.520 --> 00:09:14.000
 - When you say barked with joy,

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:16.000
 do you not mean barked in absolute terror?

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:17.000
 - barked in like,

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:19.120
 "Why the fuck do you just drop me out of that balloon, mate?"

00:09:19.120 --> 00:09:20.720
 - He then shits himself with joy.

00:09:20.720 --> 00:09:23.200
 (laughing)

00:09:23.200 --> 00:09:26.920
 - Ben Franklin patented a balloon-related thing,

00:09:26.920 --> 00:09:28.280
 like he painted it everything else.

00:09:28.280 --> 00:09:31.880
 - He patented a refrigerator that tethered to a balloon,

00:09:31.880 --> 00:09:34.640
 and it was meant to lift food up into where the air was cool,

00:09:34.640 --> 00:09:36.880
 and that's how you'd refrigerate your food.

00:09:36.880 --> 00:09:37.720
 - Why?

00:09:37.720 --> 00:09:38.560
 - I have heard of that before.

00:09:38.560 --> 00:09:39.560
 - That is so cool.

00:09:39.560 --> 00:09:40.600
 - It's inconvenient, though.

00:09:40.600 --> 00:09:41.440
 - It is.

00:09:41.440 --> 00:09:43.480
 If you're going for a late-night snack, it's...

00:09:43.480 --> 00:09:44.920
 - But what you have to do is pull it down.

00:09:44.920 --> 00:09:46.640
 You just kind of winch it back down.

00:09:46.640 --> 00:09:47.480
 - Yeah.

00:09:47.480 --> 00:09:48.320
 - You get your food out,

00:09:48.320 --> 00:09:49.160
 and then you let it go back up again.

00:09:49.160 --> 00:09:50.600
 - Again, I was thinking of shooting it down,

00:09:50.600 --> 00:09:51.440
 I feel like.

00:09:51.440 --> 00:09:52.480
 - By the anti-thing.

00:09:52.480 --> 00:09:53.480
 (laughing)

00:09:53.480 --> 00:09:55.200
 - These eggs are broken again.

00:09:55.200 --> 00:09:56.920
 (laughing)

00:09:56.920 --> 00:09:59.520
 (upbeat music)

00:10:00.360 --> 00:10:02.360
 (upbeat music)

00:10:02.360 --> 00:10:04.200
 - Okay, it is time for fact number two,

00:10:04.200 --> 00:10:06.320
 and that is Chuzinski.

00:10:06.320 --> 00:10:08.520
 - My fact this week is that in rage rooms,

00:10:08.520 --> 00:10:10.480
 where people pay to smash things up,

00:10:10.480 --> 00:10:13.400
 the things people want to smash up the most are printers.

00:10:13.400 --> 00:10:15.880
 Yeah, they hate them.

00:10:15.880 --> 00:10:16.840
 They hate printers.

00:10:16.840 --> 00:10:18.240
 So, rage rooms are these things

00:10:18.240 --> 00:10:20.160
 that are kind of popping up all over the place.

00:10:20.160 --> 00:10:22.440
 Quite a few of them in America and in Canada,

00:10:22.440 --> 00:10:23.840
 where you pay to go,

00:10:23.840 --> 00:10:26.200
 and you can either smash up their possessions,

00:10:26.200 --> 00:10:28.000
 so they provide a bunch of stuff,

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:29.320
 or you can bring your own stuff,

00:10:29.320 --> 00:10:31.440
 and they're becoming increasingly popular.

00:10:31.440 --> 00:10:33.360
 - Better to do someone else's stuff, right?

00:10:33.360 --> 00:10:34.480
 - Well, I think it depends.

00:10:34.480 --> 00:10:35.640
 How much you just like that person.

00:10:35.640 --> 00:10:37.240
 - If you just like your own stuff a lot.

00:10:37.240 --> 00:10:38.880
 - Yeah, well, why did you pay it then?

00:10:38.880 --> 00:10:40.040
 - I know, but let's say you've got a pen

00:10:40.040 --> 00:10:40.960
 that you really don't like.

00:10:40.960 --> 00:10:42.720
 - You're not gonna smash up a pen.

00:10:42.720 --> 00:10:45.800
 - That is the most pussy rage room attendant

00:10:45.800 --> 00:10:46.640
 I've ever seen.

00:10:46.640 --> 00:10:47.480
 - What?

00:10:47.480 --> 00:10:48.320
 - You turning up with one bike.

00:10:48.320 --> 00:10:49.320
 - You're right.

00:10:49.320 --> 00:10:50.160
 (laughing)

00:10:50.160 --> 00:10:51.160
 - I'm now with this guy, baby.

00:10:51.160 --> 00:10:52.720
 - He keeps leaking.

00:10:52.720 --> 00:10:54.160
 - I do it really psychologically though.

00:10:54.160 --> 00:10:57.360
 I put it in a chair and then I shine a light in it's nib.

00:10:57.360 --> 00:10:58.480
 (laughing)

00:10:58.480 --> 00:11:00.640
 - I asked you to let a question before I beat it up.

00:11:00.640 --> 00:11:02.000
 (laughing)

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:03.440
 - I'm holding a pen, I'm sorry,

00:11:03.440 --> 00:11:05.960
 I've got a poor imagination.

00:11:05.960 --> 00:11:07.080
 - I love at the end of the hour

00:11:07.080 --> 00:11:09.000
 you come up slightly beat up somehow.

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:11.160
 (laughing)

00:11:11.160 --> 00:11:13.200
 - Just got stuff drawn over the space.

00:11:13.200 --> 00:11:14.480
 (laughing)

00:11:14.480 --> 00:11:16.600
 - Pen strolls out nonchalantly out of you.

00:11:16.600 --> 00:11:17.520
 (laughing)

00:11:17.520 --> 00:11:18.360
 Hails a cab.

00:11:18.360 --> 00:11:20.640
 (laughing)

00:11:20.640 --> 00:11:21.880
 - But no, this is a thing if you go through

00:11:21.880 --> 00:11:23.000
 the rage room site.

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:25.440
 There's a one called Battle Sports in Toronto

00:11:25.440 --> 00:11:28.160
 that says it goes through 15 printers a week.

00:11:28.160 --> 00:11:31.120
 The same in New York and the fragment room and Singapore.

00:11:31.120 --> 00:11:33.920
 They also printers are almost sold after objects.

00:11:33.920 --> 00:11:34.960
 We need to provide lots of them.

00:11:34.960 --> 00:11:36.240
 People want to break them up.

00:11:36.240 --> 00:11:38.440
 - I like this in America in New York.

00:11:38.440 --> 00:11:40.800
 There's the Reckon Club and the Reckon Club,

00:11:40.800 --> 00:11:43.360
 it has, you know, you can get packages that you can buy.

00:11:43.360 --> 00:11:44.560
 So I want it all.

00:11:44.560 --> 00:11:47.920
 It's a package you can get, which is $149.

00:11:47.920 --> 00:11:49.840
 You can even buy gift certificates for people.

00:11:49.840 --> 00:11:51.680
 So, you know, both they presence,

00:11:51.680 --> 00:11:53.120
 go for an hour in the rage room.

00:11:53.120 --> 00:11:54.920
 - They should have called it the Reckfast Club.

00:11:54.920 --> 00:11:56.000
 - Yes, they should have.

00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:56.840
 Very nice.

00:11:56.840 --> 00:11:57.680
 - Why didn't they?

00:11:57.680 --> 00:11:58.760
 - We should start our own.

00:11:58.760 --> 00:12:00.240
 You and your pen's only.

00:12:00.240 --> 00:12:02.360
 (all laughing)

00:12:02.360 --> 00:12:04.880
 - Yeah, so what's nice about this is it's the same,

00:12:04.880 --> 00:12:06.600
 obviously, like every rage room you go in

00:12:06.600 --> 00:12:08.680
 and you destroy stuff, but what I particularly like

00:12:08.680 --> 00:12:11.800
 is when they started, there was a guy who runs it

00:12:11.800 --> 00:12:14.840
 called Mr. Daily or Dally, D-A-L-Y.

00:12:14.840 --> 00:12:16.400
 - Dally, he's got Tom Daley, I think, actually.

00:12:16.400 --> 00:12:17.960
 - Oh, is he, Mr. Tom Daley.

00:12:17.960 --> 00:12:19.800
 So he, when he was in there and they say

00:12:19.800 --> 00:12:21.880
 this was an early setback, he was in the room

00:12:21.880 --> 00:12:23.640
 showing a couple of all the things

00:12:23.640 --> 00:12:26.200
 that they could do via his laptop, a video.

00:12:26.200 --> 00:12:27.800
 And then he left the room, but he accidentally left

00:12:27.800 --> 00:12:29.720
 the laptop in there, he smashed it up.

00:12:29.720 --> 00:12:31.080
 (all laughing)

00:12:31.080 --> 00:12:33.040
 Yeah, so he came back in there, the other guy was like,

00:12:33.040 --> 00:12:33.880
 "Ah!"

00:12:33.880 --> 00:12:34.720
 And he didn't tell them, 'cause he thought,

00:12:34.720 --> 00:12:36.000
 "Oh, I don't want to ruin their experience."

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:38.240
 But he, as of then, started labeling everything

00:12:38.240 --> 00:12:39.320
 as, "Don't smash this."

00:12:39.320 --> 00:12:42.120
 - I went on the Wikipedia for rage rooms,

00:12:42.120 --> 00:12:43.600
 but I did it about four months ago,

00:12:43.600 --> 00:12:46.040
 so it might have been changed by now.

00:12:46.040 --> 00:12:48.080
 But they said that the concept of an anger room

00:12:48.080 --> 00:12:52.040
 is at least 20, at least 2000 years old.

00:12:52.040 --> 00:12:52.880
 - Is it?

00:12:52.880 --> 00:12:54.560
 - Yeah, but that's what Wikipedia says,

00:12:54.560 --> 00:12:55.880
 and who are we to doubt them?

00:12:55.880 --> 00:12:56.720
 - What are they saying about this?

00:12:56.720 --> 00:12:59.480
 - They say it was Queen Kaikei,

00:12:59.480 --> 00:13:01.920
 who in an old book was said that she was going to,

00:13:01.920 --> 00:13:06.000
 the palace anger room, and actually it was a sulking chamber

00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:07.000
 when I looked it up.

00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:08.680
 That's how it's usually translated.

00:13:08.680 --> 00:13:10.040
 - Apparently it was like a dark room

00:13:10.040 --> 00:13:12.240
 where you would lie down and sulk.

00:13:12.240 --> 00:13:13.520
 - Mm-hmm.

00:13:13.520 --> 00:13:14.600
 - Yeah, so not really arranged.

00:13:14.600 --> 00:13:16.320
 - I do like the sound of that though.

00:13:16.320 --> 00:13:19.320
 - Yeah, yeah, 'cause people rage manifest differently,

00:13:19.320 --> 00:13:20.160
 doesn't it?

00:13:20.160 --> 00:13:21.760
 Some people just want to lie down in the dark

00:13:21.760 --> 00:13:24.000
 and be really pissed off with the world.

00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:26.560
 Some of us like to smash our exes stuff.

00:13:26.560 --> 00:13:27.480
 Actually the most,

00:13:27.480 --> 00:13:31.440
 the most I say that because I think the most common thing

00:13:31.440 --> 00:13:33.440
 for people who do bring in their own things

00:13:33.440 --> 00:13:34.720
 are people who've had a breakup

00:13:34.720 --> 00:13:36.680
 and they bring in all their exes old stuff.

00:13:36.680 --> 00:13:38.000
 This is what the Toronto play said.

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:39.400
 So it's said for $20 extra,

00:13:39.400 --> 00:13:41.320
 you can bring your own stuff to smash.

00:13:41.320 --> 00:13:43.560
 And the founder said that by far and away,

00:13:43.560 --> 00:13:45.960
 the most common thing to do is to bring in your exes stuff.

00:13:45.960 --> 00:13:47.440
 And he said, "The people often come in

00:13:47.440 --> 00:13:49.280
 and you'll hear them screaming and shouting in there,

00:13:49.280 --> 00:13:51.760
 things like, oh, you think you're so good?

00:13:51.760 --> 00:13:54.160
 Argg, and then you'll hear us smash."

00:13:54.160 --> 00:13:55.360
 - You think you're always right?

00:13:55.360 --> 00:13:56.800
 - I think that's pronounced "Arg."

00:13:56.800 --> 00:13:58.320
 (laughing)

00:13:58.320 --> 00:14:00.560
 - How do you spell "Arg" then?

00:14:00.560 --> 00:14:01.640
 Is it without the age?

00:14:01.640 --> 00:14:02.720
 - I don't think there is a word.

00:14:02.720 --> 00:14:03.720
 - Who says "Arg"?

00:14:03.720 --> 00:14:04.880
 - Pirates.

00:14:04.880 --> 00:14:06.240
 - No, they don't, they go, "Arg."

00:14:06.240 --> 00:14:07.400
 - Oh yeah.

00:14:07.400 --> 00:14:10.720
 - Oh, we've not been hearing the end of their sentence.

00:14:10.720 --> 00:14:12.840
 (laughing)

00:14:12.840 --> 00:14:15.520
 - One of the first ones that was set up in Dallas in 2011

00:14:15.520 --> 00:14:17.360
 by a lady called Donna Alexander.

00:14:17.360 --> 00:14:20.240
 And she just started charging $5 to smash things

00:14:20.240 --> 00:14:22.640
 that she collected from curbs in the area.

00:14:22.640 --> 00:14:23.480
 - Herica.

00:14:23.480 --> 00:14:24.320
 - She just sort of picked it up.

00:14:24.320 --> 00:14:25.440
 So it was very ad hoc at the beginning.

00:14:25.440 --> 00:14:27.000
 And then she'd get people knocking on her door,

00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:28.520
 kind of like a fight club saying,

00:14:28.520 --> 00:14:30.520
 "Is this where you go to smash stuff up?"

00:14:30.520 --> 00:14:33.400
 And her insurer had to invent an entirely new category

00:14:33.400 --> 00:14:34.880
 just for her.

00:14:34.880 --> 00:14:36.240
 - Oh, very exciting.

00:14:36.240 --> 00:14:37.080
 - Yeah.

00:14:37.080 --> 00:14:38.520
 - And what do you mean by just picking stuff up

00:14:38.520 --> 00:14:40.080
 like as in flight tipping?

00:14:40.080 --> 00:14:41.680
 - You know when people leave things out,

00:14:41.680 --> 00:14:43.960
 exactly flight tipping, like leave an old fridge out

00:14:43.960 --> 00:14:47.000
 or drop a lot of pens that they don't want anymore

00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:50.040
 for the faulty kind of thing.

00:14:50.040 --> 00:14:50.880
 - That's really cool.

00:14:50.880 --> 00:14:52.440
 - Yeah.

00:14:52.440 --> 00:14:53.440
 - Stuff on printers?

00:14:53.440 --> 00:14:54.280
 - Oh yeah.

00:14:54.280 --> 00:14:55.840
 - I was reading about printer jams

00:14:55.840 --> 00:14:58.840
 and everyone finds them very annoying.

00:14:58.840 --> 00:15:00.760
 Apart from people who work in printers

00:15:00.760 --> 00:15:02.960
 who find them really exciting.

00:15:02.960 --> 00:15:07.080
 I say it's the it's the it's the elemental struggle

00:15:07.080 --> 00:15:08.920
 between the natural and the mechanical

00:15:08.920 --> 00:15:10.960
 because paper is made out of trees

00:15:10.960 --> 00:15:15.040
 and printers are made out of metal and shit and plastic.

00:15:15.040 --> 00:15:16.360
 - I think the ultimate challenge

00:15:16.360 --> 00:15:17.960
 is throwing a dog with a parachute

00:15:17.960 --> 00:15:21.120
 out of a hot air balloon and then catching it again.

00:15:21.120 --> 00:15:24.880
 - Do you guys know about the first printer ever to go into space?

00:15:24.880 --> 00:15:26.040
 - No.

00:15:26.040 --> 00:15:29.640
 - This was a printer that was sent up on the ISS in 1998.

00:15:29.640 --> 00:15:32.840
 Sorry, this was the first color printer ever to go into space.

00:15:32.840 --> 00:15:33.760
 (laughing)

00:15:33.760 --> 00:15:38.080
 So it was sent up in 1998 with a discovery mission

00:15:38.080 --> 00:15:41.480
 and it was used solely to make Halloween masks.

00:15:41.480 --> 00:15:42.520
 So it was sent up.

00:15:42.520 --> 00:15:43.680
 It was kind of a secret thing.

00:15:43.680 --> 00:15:45.720
 So John Glenn, who was by then a senator,

00:15:45.720 --> 00:15:46.920
 was on that mission.

00:15:46.920 --> 00:15:50.560
 But he'd been the third person I think to orbit the Earth

00:15:50.560 --> 00:15:52.000
 in 1962.

00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:54.800
 And so he was this big space hero by that point.

00:15:54.800 --> 00:15:56.560
 And so on that 1998 mission,

00:15:56.560 --> 00:15:58.440
 the whole crew printed color portraits of him

00:15:58.440 --> 00:16:00.560
 off this floppy disk and they made these portraits

00:16:00.560 --> 00:16:01.760
 into Halloween masks.

00:16:01.760 --> 00:16:03.680
 And then they all went around pretending to be John Glenn

00:16:03.680 --> 00:16:05.960
 in a nod to his greatness.

00:16:05.960 --> 00:16:06.800
 - Cool.

00:16:06.800 --> 00:16:08.240
 I'd print out a full alien costume

00:16:08.240 --> 00:16:10.000
 and then sell it to take it to myself

00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:11.640
 and then freak my crew mates out.

00:16:11.640 --> 00:16:13.200
 - Do you think they'd fall for that?

00:16:13.200 --> 00:16:15.040
 Because I don't think anyone was floating around

00:16:15.040 --> 00:16:16.400
 going oh my god it's John Glenn.

00:16:16.400 --> 00:16:19.360
 Oh my god it's John Glenn, oh my god it's John Glenn.

00:16:19.360 --> 00:16:20.520
 - That's true.

00:16:20.520 --> 00:16:23.100
 (upbeat music)

00:16:23.100 --> 00:16:29.160
 - Okay, it is time for fact number three.

00:16:29.160 --> 00:16:30.720
 And that is my fact.

00:16:30.720 --> 00:16:33.160
 My fact this week is one of the first things

00:16:33.160 --> 00:16:35.360
 that McDonald's founder Ray Crock did

00:16:35.360 --> 00:16:38.640
 when he bought the baseball team San Diego Padres

00:16:38.640 --> 00:16:41.520
 was to sign a player called Big Mac.

00:16:41.520 --> 00:16:42.440
 - Very good.

00:16:42.440 --> 00:16:44.880
 Did he do it because he was the founder of McDonald's

00:16:44.880 --> 00:16:46.040
 or was he just a good baseball player?

00:16:46.040 --> 00:16:47.920
 - Big Mac was a great baseball player.

00:16:47.920 --> 00:16:50.600
 Willie MacCovie was his real name.

00:16:50.600 --> 00:16:53.880
 He was a very good player and obviously Ray Crock

00:16:53.880 --> 00:16:58.480
 who built McDonald's from a very tiny brother operation

00:16:58.480 --> 00:17:01.120
 of the McDonald brothers into the global success it was.

00:17:01.120 --> 00:17:03.720
 Had an eye for franchising, for merchandising,

00:17:03.720 --> 00:17:04.840
 for commercialization.

00:17:04.840 --> 00:17:06.520
 He saw that by getting Big Mac in

00:17:06.520 --> 00:17:09.080
 he could do a lot of cross promotion.

00:17:09.080 --> 00:17:11.760
 So for example, during the first season

00:17:11.760 --> 00:17:13.640
 they did Big Mac Sundays.

00:17:13.640 --> 00:17:15.960
 So the idea would be that you could take a ticket stub

00:17:15.960 --> 00:17:18.800
 and get a free Big Mac after a match

00:17:18.800 --> 00:17:20.280
 if the Padres had won.

00:17:20.280 --> 00:17:22.080
 Unfortunately when the promotion started

00:17:22.080 --> 00:17:23.920
 they lost 11 straight home games.

00:17:23.920 --> 00:17:26.480
 And so as a result they had to change it to

00:17:26.480 --> 00:17:29.240
 whether they win or lose you get a free Big Mac.

00:17:29.240 --> 00:17:30.440
 - Yeah they were terrible weren't they

00:17:30.440 --> 00:17:31.920
 when he first took over.

00:17:31.920 --> 00:17:32.760
 - Yeah.

00:17:32.760 --> 00:17:34.280
 - Was there not a thing about him

00:17:34.280 --> 00:17:36.360
 shouting at them on the pitch or something like that?

00:17:36.360 --> 00:17:39.040
 - The first match he went, he was very excited

00:17:39.040 --> 00:17:41.720
 because the idea of him signing this new player

00:17:41.720 --> 00:17:43.440
 and the fact that Ray Crock had taken over it.

00:17:43.440 --> 00:17:45.840
 He got the attendance right up.

00:17:45.840 --> 00:17:50.120
 They, for their opener, they drew 39,000 people

00:17:50.120 --> 00:17:51.960
 but they totally sucked in the match.

00:17:51.960 --> 00:17:53.760
 And as a result he went into the booth

00:17:53.760 --> 00:17:55.960
 where the commentators were commentating on the match

00:17:55.960 --> 00:17:59.280
 took over the Tannoy and he said,

00:17:59.280 --> 00:18:00.560
 "I have good news and bad news."

00:18:00.560 --> 00:18:03.000
 The good news is that the Dodgers drew 31,000

00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:06.360
 for their opener and we've drawn 39,000 for ours.

00:18:06.360 --> 00:18:08.600
 The bad news is that this is the most stupid

00:18:08.600 --> 00:18:10.960
 baseball playing I have ever seen.

00:18:10.960 --> 00:18:13.840
 He said that to the players heard the fans

00:18:13.840 --> 00:18:15.440
 and the fans cheered, they loved it.

00:18:15.440 --> 00:18:17.000
 They loved that he was being honest.

00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:19.960
 And then someone ran on the field of Strieker

00:18:19.960 --> 00:18:21.920
 and he yelled, "Get that Strieker off the field.

00:18:21.920 --> 00:18:22.920
 "Throw him in jail."

00:18:22.920 --> 00:18:25.640
 So he was just commenting to the whole stadium

00:18:25.640 --> 00:18:27.920
 of 39,000 people his thoughts.

00:18:27.920 --> 00:18:28.760
 It was amazing.

00:18:28.760 --> 00:18:30.080
 - He was angry.

00:18:30.080 --> 00:18:30.920
 - Yeah.

00:18:30.920 --> 00:18:33.720
 Just before we did this show in Bristol,

00:18:33.720 --> 00:18:35.480
 the night before, or the day before,

00:18:35.480 --> 00:18:39.160
 I watched the founder for research for this.

00:18:39.160 --> 00:18:41.640
 I was a really good film about Ray Crock

00:18:41.640 --> 00:18:43.160
 but I can't remember any of it now.

00:18:43.160 --> 00:18:44.000
 (laughing)

00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:44.840
 - Good story.

00:18:44.840 --> 00:18:47.520
 - I think I remember is that when the brothers

00:18:47.520 --> 00:18:50.840
 who founded McDonald's, so this is not Ray Crock,

00:18:50.840 --> 00:18:53.800
 their idea was called the method, I think.

00:18:53.800 --> 00:18:56.320
 And they worked out the size of their kitchen

00:18:56.320 --> 00:18:57.320
 and where everything went,

00:18:57.320 --> 00:18:59.200
 so there was a most efficient possible way

00:18:59.200 --> 00:19:00.360
 of running a kitchen.

00:19:00.360 --> 00:19:02.880
 And the way they did it is they went to a tennis court

00:19:02.880 --> 00:19:05.160
 and they had chalk and they drew all the different

00:19:05.160 --> 00:19:07.200
 possibilities and they got people,

00:19:07.200 --> 00:19:09.320
 hired people for very little money

00:19:09.320 --> 00:19:12.160
 to try out pretending to cook all these burgers,

00:19:12.160 --> 00:19:13.280
 pretending to do milkshakes,

00:19:13.280 --> 00:19:16.520
 pretending to do fries until they got the exact one.

00:19:16.520 --> 00:19:18.560
 And they did this for days and days.

00:19:18.560 --> 00:19:20.400
 They eventually found the right one

00:19:20.400 --> 00:19:22.800
 and then that night it rained

00:19:22.800 --> 00:19:25.080
 and all of their chalk marks got washed away

00:19:25.080 --> 00:19:26.560
 and they had to do the whole experiment.

00:19:26.560 --> 00:19:27.720
 - Oh no.

00:19:27.720 --> 00:19:29.680
 - The whole sort of the design of the kitchen

00:19:29.680 --> 00:19:30.840
 like the choreography.

00:19:30.840 --> 00:19:31.680
 That's very cool.

00:19:31.680 --> 00:19:32.680
 - Oh wow.

00:19:32.680 --> 00:19:34.440
 - Do you know that Ray Crock was in the same

00:19:34.440 --> 00:19:36.200
 Ray Cross company in the first world war

00:19:36.200 --> 00:19:38.400
 driving ambulances as Walt Disney?

00:19:38.400 --> 00:19:39.240
 - Wow.

00:19:39.240 --> 00:19:40.080
 - Was it really?

00:19:40.080 --> 00:19:42.000
 - And they both went on to be very successful

00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:46.680
 in their own ways, and they both lied about their age

00:19:46.680 --> 00:19:47.520
 to get in.

00:19:47.520 --> 00:19:48.360
 - Really?

00:19:48.360 --> 00:19:49.200
 - Yeah.

00:19:49.200 --> 00:19:51.000
 - He had a really weird relationship with his wife,

00:19:51.000 --> 00:19:51.840
 didn't he?

00:19:51.840 --> 00:19:52.680
 - Did he?

00:19:52.680 --> 00:19:53.520
 - Joan Crock.

00:19:53.520 --> 00:19:56.360
 So she, Crock suddenly becomes a funny asser name

00:19:56.360 --> 00:19:58.200
 when he was actually a Joan.

00:19:58.200 --> 00:20:01.040
 So I think first of all they were married

00:20:01.040 --> 00:20:02.760
 when he said he wanted to buy the Padres

00:20:02.760 --> 00:20:05.280
 and she said is that a monastery?

00:20:05.280 --> 00:20:08.240
 And then it seems like they must have had some tensions

00:20:08.240 --> 00:20:11.480
 'cause first of all she launched an alcoholism charity

00:20:11.480 --> 00:20:13.800
 called Operation Cork, which is Crock,

00:20:13.800 --> 00:20:16.000
 his surname spelled backwards.

00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:17.720
 And she used to produce TV dramas

00:20:17.720 --> 00:20:19.600
 about the impact of alcoholism on families

00:20:19.600 --> 00:20:21.160
 'cause I think he was an alcoholic.

00:20:21.160 --> 00:20:23.600
 So she said she raised awareness about that.

00:20:23.600 --> 00:20:27.280
 But also when he died in 1984 she immediately gave away

00:20:27.280 --> 00:20:29.560
 the estate and distributed all the money

00:20:29.560 --> 00:20:31.920
 to all these like some great charities.

00:20:31.920 --> 00:20:33.920
 And also she gave a million dollars

00:20:33.920 --> 00:20:36.640
 to the Democratic Party, which is a slap in the face

00:20:36.640 --> 00:20:38.600
 because Ray Crock was a massive Republican.

00:20:38.600 --> 00:20:42.760
 He'd given like quarter of a million to Nixon's re-election campaign.

00:20:42.760 --> 00:20:47.480
 So yeah, she sort of undid his legacy in some ways.

00:20:47.480 --> 00:20:49.280
 - And she was amazing for the baseball team as well

00:20:49.280 --> 00:20:51.280
 'cause after he passed away she took over

00:20:51.280 --> 00:20:53.160
 but she knew virtually nothing about baseball.

00:20:53.160 --> 00:20:55.320
 But in that first season after she took over

00:20:55.320 --> 00:20:57.080
 her team made it to the World Series.

00:20:57.080 --> 00:20:59.360
 - Well it seems like she knew a lot about baseball

00:20:59.360 --> 00:21:00.640
 on like her husband.

00:21:00.640 --> 00:21:01.480
 (laughs)

00:21:01.480 --> 00:21:02.920
 - Well she learned, yeah she learned on the go,

00:21:02.920 --> 00:21:04.160
 yeah he definitely didn't like it.

00:21:04.160 --> 00:21:07.360
 He at one point after the Padres had lost 102 games

00:21:07.360 --> 00:21:09.680
 said I bought the team to have some fun

00:21:09.680 --> 00:21:12.040
 but it's proving to be about as enjoyable as a wake

00:21:12.040 --> 00:21:16.880
 your own, that was his public comment about his own team.

00:21:16.880 --> 00:21:18.680
 - Your guy called Big Mac.

00:21:18.680 --> 00:21:19.520
 - Yeah.

00:21:19.520 --> 00:21:20.920
 - I went on the internet and searched

00:21:20.920 --> 00:21:23.600
 for some other names of baseball players

00:21:23.600 --> 00:21:27.200
 and I found that there was a guy called Thomas Lewis Fries

00:21:27.200 --> 00:21:30.400
 and another one called Philip Douglas Koch.

00:21:30.400 --> 00:21:34.640
 So you can have Big Mac fries and coke with the players.

00:21:34.640 --> 00:21:39.640
 Some other players, Cannonball, Ticcom, Jolly Dick Shot.

00:21:39.640 --> 00:21:40.960
 - Lovely.

00:21:40.960 --> 00:21:44.440
 - His nickname was Ugly so people called him Ugly Dick Shot

00:21:44.440 --> 00:21:46.760
 and Wonderful Mounds.

00:21:46.760 --> 00:21:47.600
 - No.

00:21:47.600 --> 00:21:48.440
 - His name is nice.

00:21:48.440 --> 00:21:50.640
 - Wonderful, sorry that's a nickname surely.

00:21:50.640 --> 00:21:51.880
 - His first name was Wonderful,

00:21:51.880 --> 00:21:53.920
 his second name was Terrific.

00:21:53.920 --> 00:21:55.160
 - What?

00:21:55.160 --> 00:21:56.000
 - No.

00:21:56.000 --> 00:21:56.760
 - Wonderful Terrific.

00:21:56.760 --> 00:21:58.560
 - Actually Wonderful Mounds.

00:21:58.560 --> 00:21:59.400
 - Okay.

00:21:59.400 --> 00:22:01.920
 - I mean it wasn't the surname that I was quibbling with.

00:22:01.920 --> 00:22:03.440
 (laughs)

00:22:03.440 --> 00:22:04.840
 - Wonderful Terrific Mounds.

00:22:04.840 --> 00:22:05.680
 That's a good name, isn't it?

00:22:05.680 --> 00:22:07.160
 - Yes, it's a lovely.

00:22:07.160 --> 00:22:10.200
 - Well there's a guy in basketball called Metaworld Peace.

00:22:10.200 --> 00:22:11.920
 That's his name.

00:22:11.920 --> 00:22:13.040
 He's playing for China now

00:22:13.040 --> 00:22:15.040
 and he's changed his name to Panda.

00:22:15.040 --> 00:22:15.880
 - Okay.

00:22:15.880 --> 00:22:17.520
 - He just keeps going for the name changes.

00:22:17.520 --> 00:22:20.200
 - This is an American footballer called Lion King.

00:22:20.200 --> 00:22:22.000
 - Sir, Lion King, first name Lion.

00:22:22.000 --> 00:22:22.840
 - Yeah, cool.

00:22:22.840 --> 00:22:23.920
 - That's so good.

00:22:23.920 --> 00:22:26.720
 - Did you know chicken nuggets were almost onion nuggets?

00:22:26.720 --> 00:22:28.520
 They trial the two, not realizing

00:22:28.520 --> 00:22:29.600
 that people might prefer chicken.

00:22:29.600 --> 00:22:30.800
 They almost made them onions.

00:22:30.800 --> 00:22:32.600
 - That might be nice, like an onion bargie.

00:22:32.600 --> 00:22:33.440
 - I think so.

00:22:33.440 --> 00:22:34.440
 - Or an onion ring.

00:22:34.440 --> 00:22:35.440
 - Yeah, absolutely.

00:22:35.440 --> 00:22:37.320
 - It's like an onion ring, but it's an onion ball.

00:22:37.320 --> 00:22:38.320
 - Yeah, fine.

00:22:38.320 --> 00:22:40.080
 - It's like an onion bargie, in fact.

00:22:40.080 --> 00:22:41.240
 - Yeah, yeah.

00:22:41.240 --> 00:22:42.080
 (laughs)

00:22:42.080 --> 00:22:43.240
 Yeah.

00:22:43.240 --> 00:22:44.560
 There's a point.

00:22:44.560 --> 00:22:47.320
 Do you know there's a secret rebel McDonald's operating

00:22:47.320 --> 00:22:48.320
 in India?

00:22:48.320 --> 00:22:49.840
 - Ah, this is very cool.

00:22:49.840 --> 00:22:50.840
 - I need to blow in their cover.

00:22:50.840 --> 00:22:52.600
 - Yeah, well sorry guys.

00:22:52.600 --> 00:22:56.120
 There was a big kerfuffle between McDonald's global

00:22:56.120 --> 00:22:57.640
 and the Indian version of McDonald's.

00:22:57.640 --> 00:22:59.760
 - Do they make chicken bargies?

00:22:59.760 --> 00:23:01.240
 - I don't know if they do.

00:23:01.240 --> 00:23:02.080
 I hope they do.

00:23:02.080 --> 00:23:04.240
 They do do a thing called McSpicy Peneer,

00:23:04.240 --> 00:23:06.120
 which is very popular, it sells out every day,

00:23:06.120 --> 00:23:07.800
 but they canceled their franchise agreement

00:23:07.800 --> 00:23:09.160
 with 150 restaurants.

00:23:09.160 --> 00:23:12.600
 They said, "Oh, it's not working out for whatever reason."

00:23:12.600 --> 00:23:15.040
 And the restaurants kept on going, selling the food.

00:23:15.040 --> 00:23:15.880
 - Right.

00:23:15.880 --> 00:23:17.440
 - And no one stopped them or intervened.

00:23:17.440 --> 00:23:19.440
 And they've left up the golden archers and everything,

00:23:19.440 --> 00:23:21.040
 and they're still trading under the McDonald's name.

00:23:21.040 --> 00:23:21.880
 Yeah.

00:23:21.880 --> 00:23:23.880
 - Yeah, the archers aren't always golden.

00:23:23.880 --> 00:23:26.000
 There are a few exceptions,

00:23:26.000 --> 00:23:29.520
 one of which is in Sedona in Arizona

00:23:29.520 --> 00:23:32.960
 and their turquoise, why, get any guesses?

00:23:32.960 --> 00:23:33.800
 Why?

00:23:33.800 --> 00:23:35.840
 - 'Cause the yellowness blends into the desert,

00:23:35.840 --> 00:23:36.840
 so you can't see it.

00:23:36.840 --> 00:23:37.680
 - Exactly.

00:23:37.680 --> 00:23:39.280
 - No, it was, it was actually said,

00:23:39.280 --> 00:23:41.320
 it sort of clashed too much with it.

00:23:41.320 --> 00:23:42.520
 - Oh, so the opposite.

00:23:42.520 --> 00:23:43.840
 - Yeah, but yeah.

00:23:43.840 --> 00:23:45.320
 You're the right kind of line.

00:23:45.320 --> 00:23:46.480
 So yeah, the government said,

00:23:46.480 --> 00:23:48.560
 look, that kind of clashes with our desert.

00:23:48.560 --> 00:23:50.040
 It looks silly, do something else.

00:23:50.040 --> 00:23:50.880
 Yeah.

00:23:50.880 --> 00:23:55.000
 - I read that the guy who created the golden archers

00:23:55.000 --> 00:23:57.000
 was offered a deal very early on in the day

00:23:57.000 --> 00:23:58.760
 of a cut of it forever on,

00:23:58.760 --> 00:24:01.320
 or a one off payment, which was a very low sum.

00:24:01.320 --> 00:24:02.920
 - They always take the very low sum.

00:24:02.920 --> 00:24:04.400
 - Yeah, they take the low sum.

00:24:04.400 --> 00:24:05.640
 - They always go in and they say,

00:24:05.640 --> 00:24:07.240
 well, offer you this very low sum.

00:24:07.240 --> 00:24:09.640
 - I love you, money for the rest of your life

00:24:09.640 --> 00:24:10.600
 and they always take it.

00:24:10.600 --> 00:24:11.440
 - Yeah.

00:24:11.440 --> 00:24:12.440
 - They never even specify the low sum, do they?

00:24:12.440 --> 00:24:14.600
 They just say, very low sum, do you want it?

00:24:14.600 --> 00:24:16.080
 (laughing)

00:24:16.080 --> 00:24:18.660
 (upbeat music)

00:24:18.660 --> 00:24:24.560
 - Okay, it is time for a final fact of the show

00:24:24.560 --> 00:24:25.920
 and that is James.

00:24:25.920 --> 00:24:27.640
 - Okay, my fact this week is that

00:24:27.640 --> 00:24:32.640
 the yellow-billed ox-pecker bird sleeps in giraffe's armpits.

00:24:32.640 --> 00:24:34.000
 - Mmm. - It's so cool.

00:24:34.000 --> 00:24:34.840
 - Nice.

00:24:34.840 --> 00:24:35.840
 - We've known for a long time

00:24:35.840 --> 00:24:38.600
 that they kind of hang out on these African animals

00:24:38.600 --> 00:24:41.720
 like giraffe and water buffalo and stuff like that.

00:24:41.720 --> 00:24:43.840
 But they've only just found out that they stay there

00:24:43.840 --> 00:24:45.440
 overnight as well.

00:24:45.440 --> 00:24:48.480
 And that comes from a multi-year camera trap study

00:24:48.480 --> 00:24:51.080
 in Tanzania, Serengeti National Park.

00:24:51.080 --> 00:24:53.600
 And so they're putting the cameras on these animals

00:24:53.600 --> 00:24:54.440
 in the middle of the night

00:24:54.440 --> 00:24:56.600
 and they found that the birds stay there.

00:24:56.600 --> 00:24:58.600
 And it seems that usually they stay there

00:24:58.600 --> 00:25:00.680
 and they have this symbiotic relationship

00:25:00.680 --> 00:25:02.440
 where they eat all the little bugs

00:25:02.440 --> 00:25:04.720
 that live in the giraffe's armpits

00:25:04.720 --> 00:25:07.240
 and they get the protection of the giraffe.

00:25:07.240 --> 00:25:09.200
 - Not just the armpits as well.

00:25:09.200 --> 00:25:10.920
 - Yes. - The legs, it's all the pits.

00:25:10.920 --> 00:25:13.880
 - The crotch is crotch every one of the pits.

00:25:13.880 --> 00:25:16.040
 - Okay, so you can get up to seven birds

00:25:16.040 --> 00:25:17.480
 in a single crotch.

00:25:17.480 --> 00:25:18.640
 (laughing)

00:25:18.640 --> 00:25:19.640
 - That was that.

00:25:19.640 --> 00:25:20.960
 A YouTube video we used to watch

00:25:20.960 --> 00:25:22.160
 in the first year of uni, I think,

00:25:22.160 --> 00:25:24.320
 so the birds are one crotch, yeah.

00:25:24.320 --> 00:25:26.880
 (laughing)

00:25:26.880 --> 00:25:28.800
 But it's really good, the giraffes are great.

00:25:28.800 --> 00:25:30.280
 They're great beds because they're off the ground,

00:25:30.280 --> 00:25:31.840
 meaning you're a bit safer as a bird,

00:25:31.840 --> 00:25:34.520
 whereas buffalo lie down and they're unstable.

00:25:34.520 --> 00:25:35.520
 Giraffes stable.

00:25:35.520 --> 00:25:36.880
 - Wait, except when a giraffe sleeps,

00:25:36.880 --> 00:25:38.280
 because they've been seen in the wild

00:25:38.280 --> 00:25:39.880
 to be sleeping while laying down.

00:25:39.880 --> 00:25:41.920
 And what they do is they bend around

00:25:41.920 --> 00:25:43.880
 and they use their butt as a pillow.

00:25:43.880 --> 00:25:45.680
 So they bring their head right around

00:25:45.680 --> 00:25:47.520
 and rest it on the top of their butt.

00:25:47.520 --> 00:25:48.360
 - That's nice.

00:25:48.360 --> 00:25:50.160
 - So I would say the best thing about being a giraffe,

00:25:50.160 --> 00:25:51.480
 actually, you can do that.

00:25:51.480 --> 00:25:52.320
 - It must be right.

00:25:52.320 --> 00:25:53.920
 I mean, we would all kill to do that.

00:25:53.920 --> 00:25:57.160
 But oxpeckers, they eat the little animals,

00:25:57.160 --> 00:25:59.800
 but they also eat the host bodily fluids,

00:25:59.800 --> 00:26:02.320
 including mucus, blood and snot,

00:26:02.320 --> 00:26:05.000
 and even the goop that you get in your eyes.

00:26:05.000 --> 00:26:05.840
 - Yeah.

00:26:05.840 --> 00:26:08.520
 - They also like to live on zebras.

00:26:08.520 --> 00:26:12.240
 And I read one article, I'll just read a bit of it.

00:26:12.240 --> 00:26:14.040
 Still in its statue-like pose,

00:26:14.040 --> 00:26:15.960
 the zebra raised its tail quickly

00:26:15.960 --> 00:26:17.920
 and held it out behind its body.

00:26:17.920 --> 00:26:20.200
 The oxpecker immediately scuttled down

00:26:20.200 --> 00:26:22.560
 onto the hairless black shiny skin

00:26:22.560 --> 00:26:25.000
 that surrounds the zebra's anal region

00:26:25.000 --> 00:26:27.280
 and worked this area assiduously.

00:26:27.280 --> 00:26:30.560
 - Sounds like an extract from six birds one crotch.

00:26:30.560 --> 00:26:32.800
 (laughing)

00:26:32.800 --> 00:26:34.400
 - Ooh, I've got a fact about symbiotic

00:26:34.400 --> 00:26:36.080
 analist relationships.

00:26:36.080 --> 00:26:36.920
 - Right.

00:26:36.920 --> 00:26:39.520
 - So there's a kind of leech called plackob,

00:26:39.520 --> 00:26:43.560
 plackob deloidies, jager skeoldi,

00:26:43.560 --> 00:26:46.160
 which is a leech, which lives inside hippo anuses.

00:26:46.160 --> 00:26:49.320
 It spends most of its life, in fact, inside a hippo's bottom.

00:26:49.320 --> 00:26:51.400
 And they live for about 2.6 years.

00:26:51.400 --> 00:26:54.480
 So they were covered in the new scientist in 1995

00:26:54.480 --> 00:26:57.200
 and the headline was, "Leech rides the tunnel of love."

00:26:57.200 --> 00:26:59.800
 'Cause it's safe from oxpeckers, actually.

00:26:59.800 --> 00:27:02.280
 It's safer if you go right into the bottom

00:27:02.280 --> 00:27:05.040
 and they have to swim into a hippo's bottom to have sex.

00:27:05.040 --> 00:27:08.040
 - Do they swim into it or do they just crawl into it?

00:27:08.040 --> 00:27:09.280
 - I think when the hippo is-

00:27:09.280 --> 00:27:10.120
 - Under water?

00:27:10.120 --> 00:27:10.960
 - Under water, I swear I'm in.

00:27:10.960 --> 00:27:12.600
 But it has special tools designed

00:27:12.600 --> 00:27:14.520
 to push open a hippo's sphincter.

00:27:14.520 --> 00:27:16.760
 - When you say tools, it's part of its body.

00:27:16.760 --> 00:27:18.080
 - It's part of its body, yeah.

00:27:18.080 --> 00:27:19.920
 - I think it's a little shovel.

00:27:19.920 --> 00:27:21.560
 (laughing)

00:27:21.560 --> 00:27:25.320
 - One really cool symbiotic relationship, I quite like.

00:27:25.320 --> 00:27:26.560
 Crabbs and urchins.

00:27:26.560 --> 00:27:28.640
 - Oh yeah. - So I didn't know about this, but-

00:27:28.640 --> 00:27:31.480
 - I hope we talk about Victorian street children here.

00:27:31.480 --> 00:27:33.840
 We're not gonna be very disappointed.

00:27:33.840 --> 00:27:35.320
 - And Jen, it's a lice, I hope.

00:27:35.320 --> 00:27:36.640
 (laughing)

00:27:36.640 --> 00:27:37.720
 - Of course.

00:27:37.720 --> 00:27:38.960
 - Cool, Blimey, Gavna.

00:27:38.960 --> 00:27:40.640
 So you're crab-proof-harving.

00:27:40.640 --> 00:27:42.320
 (laughing)

00:27:42.320 --> 00:27:44.080
 - Spot scratching your crotch, Dodger.

00:27:44.080 --> 00:27:47.080
 (laughing)

00:27:47.080 --> 00:27:48.520
 - No, it's neither of those things.

00:27:48.520 --> 00:27:51.400
 I see urchins and it's just crabs, like normal crabs.

00:27:51.400 --> 00:27:53.680
 And so urchins travel on the back of crabs,

00:27:53.680 --> 00:27:55.640
 which is useful for them, as it means they can travel.

00:27:55.640 --> 00:27:57.400
 So urchins can't really travel very well otherwise.

00:27:57.400 --> 00:27:58.240
 - See the world?

00:27:58.240 --> 00:28:00.360
 - Exactly, get out there, take some photos.

00:28:00.360 --> 00:28:01.200
 - On the gap, yeah.

00:28:01.200 --> 00:28:02.040
 (laughing)

00:28:02.040 --> 00:28:04.880
 - Right, some urchin postcards, but it's good for the crab

00:28:04.880 --> 00:28:07.280
 because they can suddenly use it as a disguise

00:28:07.280 --> 00:28:08.800
 or a weapon if they need to.

00:28:08.800 --> 00:28:11.520
 So they can sometimes get the urchin down with their claw

00:28:11.520 --> 00:28:12.880
 or face something with the urchin

00:28:12.880 --> 00:28:14.840
 and act like they've got a really awesome spiky back.

00:28:14.840 --> 00:28:15.680
 - Yeah, wow.

00:28:15.680 --> 00:28:16.960
 - I've got another one, just while we're on

00:28:16.960 --> 00:28:20.280
 the symbiotic relationship role, there's an ant,

00:28:20.280 --> 00:28:23.720
 which is called Campanosa Schmitze, which is a great name.

00:28:23.720 --> 00:28:26.640
 And it only lives on a single species of pitcher plant.

00:28:26.640 --> 00:28:30.400
 You know, pitcher plants, they're the ones that consume prey

00:28:30.400 --> 00:28:32.280
 by, I think they fall into, they drown.

00:28:32.280 --> 00:28:33.120
 - Yeah.

00:28:33.120 --> 00:28:33.960
 - So they look like a chum.

00:28:33.960 --> 00:28:34.800
 - Yeah, yeah.

00:28:34.800 --> 00:28:35.640
 - Oh wow.

00:28:35.640 --> 00:28:38.760
 - But the ants swim around in the digestive fluids

00:28:38.760 --> 00:28:41.360
 of the plant, they consume the nectar of the plant

00:28:41.360 --> 00:28:44.240
 and they also consume some of the prey that the plant eats,

00:28:44.240 --> 00:28:46.320
 but the plants which have ants swimming around

00:28:46.320 --> 00:28:48.880
 in their stomachs, basically, get bigger than those

00:28:48.880 --> 00:28:51.920
 which don't have them because the ants keep the traps clean

00:28:51.920 --> 00:28:54.600
 and they hunt mosquito larvae, which would otherwise

00:28:54.600 --> 00:28:56.440
 soak up more nutrients.

00:28:56.440 --> 00:28:58.280
 So it's beneficial to, if you're a pitcher plant,

00:28:58.280 --> 00:28:59.960
 to have ants in your stomach.

00:28:59.960 --> 00:29:02.480
 And the plants also eat the ants poo.

00:29:02.480 --> 00:29:04.320
 - Nice, as well as eating the ants.

00:29:04.320 --> 00:29:06.360
 - They don't eat the ants, the ants survive in there,

00:29:06.360 --> 00:29:07.960
 the ants are tolerated within the system.

00:29:07.960 --> 00:29:09.600
 - Yeah, you get some pitcher plants, don't you,

00:29:09.600 --> 00:29:11.680
 where you get little shrews who sit on the,

00:29:11.680 --> 00:29:13.440
 on the side of them and then poo into them

00:29:13.440 --> 00:29:15.560
 just like little toilets.

00:29:15.560 --> 00:29:18.200
 Yeah, and they eat the nitrogen of those.

00:29:18.200 --> 00:29:19.760
 - What's the benefit for the shrew,

00:29:19.760 --> 00:29:20.760
 'cause they don't mind where they poo.

00:29:20.760 --> 00:29:23.000
 - Just gets a toilet, you know, for dinner.

00:29:23.000 --> 00:29:23.840
 - Is that enjoyable?

00:29:23.840 --> 00:29:24.680
 'Cause they--

00:29:24.680 --> 00:29:26.720
 - Yeah, yes, 'cause it can sit there reading its iPhone.

00:29:26.720 --> 00:29:27.560
 - Okay, that makes sense.

00:29:27.560 --> 00:29:29.880
 - It's beneficial, you wouldn't like it

00:29:29.880 --> 00:29:32.080
 if we took away your toilet from you, Dan.

00:29:32.080 --> 00:29:34.560
 But if the concept of toilets didn't exist for us,

00:29:34.560 --> 00:29:36.080
 I would just poo here right now.

00:29:36.080 --> 00:29:37.480
 - They've now got the concept of toilets,

00:29:37.480 --> 00:29:38.920
 so they have to go as a pitcher plant.

00:29:38.920 --> 00:29:40.760
 - They don't, I mean, Dan's also very sick of question here.

00:29:40.760 --> 00:29:41.760
 What is going on?

00:29:41.760 --> 00:29:43.640
 - No animal understands the importance

00:29:43.640 --> 00:29:46.120
 of a good sewerage system except humans.

00:29:46.120 --> 00:29:49.440
 One earth is a shrew clamping up at the top of the flower

00:29:49.440 --> 00:29:52.080
 in order to take a shit where I was just doing it all around.

00:29:52.080 --> 00:29:55.760
 - I think what happens is it eats something from the flower,

00:29:55.760 --> 00:29:57.440
 maybe some nectar or something,

00:29:57.440 --> 00:30:01.520
 and that is a laxative, and then that makes it poo.

00:30:01.520 --> 00:30:02.520
 I believe that's true.

00:30:02.520 --> 00:30:03.960
 - So it almost can't get out in time.

00:30:03.960 --> 00:30:05.200
 It's kind of like a zine or something,

00:30:05.200 --> 00:30:06.200
 and it sort of has to poo in the shower.

00:30:06.200 --> 00:30:07.520
 - It's like a delicious restaurant,

00:30:07.520 --> 00:30:09.560
 but with very bad hygiene standards.

00:30:09.560 --> 00:30:13.920
 But then they use your poo to power the electricity.

00:30:13.920 --> 00:30:14.760
 - Oh, wow.

00:30:14.760 --> 00:30:15.920
 - Where is this restaurant?

00:30:15.920 --> 00:30:18.560
 - I feel a start-up coming on.

00:30:18.560 --> 00:30:22.200
 - Hey, I've got something on armpits.

00:30:22.200 --> 00:30:24.000
 In the 19th century in Austria,

00:30:24.000 --> 00:30:27.000
 there used to be the thing where, at Dancers,

00:30:27.000 --> 00:30:30.120
 women would carry underneath their armpits

00:30:30.120 --> 00:30:32.440
 a single slice of apple,

00:30:32.440 --> 00:30:34.240
 and they would hold it there all night long,

00:30:34.240 --> 00:30:36.040
 and the idea was at the end of the night,

00:30:36.040 --> 00:30:38.600
 the girl would approach someone who they'd fancy

00:30:38.600 --> 00:30:41.000
 to guy if it was a guy that they fancy.

00:30:41.000 --> 00:30:42.640
 They would go up and they would take the apple out,

00:30:42.640 --> 00:30:43.640
 and they would present the apple.

00:30:43.640 --> 00:30:45.600
 - They still do that on Love Island, I think, do they?

00:30:45.600 --> 00:30:47.440
 (all laughing)

00:30:47.440 --> 00:30:48.440
 - I think I'm sure.

00:30:48.440 --> 00:30:50.840
 - So it was sent to the guy, and if the guy eats it,

00:30:50.840 --> 00:30:52.440
 he's saying, "I'm keen."

00:30:52.440 --> 00:30:53.280
 - Yeah.

00:30:53.280 --> 00:30:54.120
 - Wow.

00:30:54.120 --> 00:30:55.720
 And is there any way for him to say,

00:30:55.720 --> 00:30:57.720
 "I'm keen without eating the armpit."

00:30:57.720 --> 00:31:00.240
 - But I think if you're not willing to eat the apple

00:31:00.240 --> 00:31:02.120
 that's been inside the armpit of your loved one,

00:31:02.120 --> 00:31:03.280
 you don't love her at all.

00:31:03.280 --> 00:31:04.640
 - You're not keen enough.

00:31:04.640 --> 00:31:07.160
 So women's armpits smell of onion,

00:31:07.160 --> 00:31:09.040
 and men's smell of cheese, apparently.

00:31:09.040 --> 00:31:09.880
 And this is--

00:31:09.880 --> 00:31:12.160
 - Well, between us, we can have a delicious bag of crisps.

00:31:12.160 --> 00:31:14.200
 (all laughing)

00:31:14.200 --> 00:31:16.480
 - You know those like salt and shake crisps

00:31:16.480 --> 00:31:18.480
 that you used to get where they don't taste of anything,

00:31:18.480 --> 00:31:19.320
 but you have to put your own--

00:31:19.320 --> 00:31:20.160
 - Yeah, absolutely.

00:31:20.160 --> 00:31:23.040
 - Are you proposing that you scissors someone else's armpit

00:31:23.040 --> 00:31:24.400
 with one crisp in the middle,

00:31:24.400 --> 00:31:25.720
 and you're gonna lovely cheese and onion--

00:31:25.720 --> 00:31:27.160
 - I'm gonna go to an Austrian dance.

00:31:27.160 --> 00:31:29.160
 (all laughing)

00:31:29.160 --> 00:31:31.320
 - I think it doesn't cost any more just to buy cheese

00:31:31.320 --> 00:31:33.080
 and onion rather than just buying cheese

00:31:33.080 --> 00:31:35.320
 and then wiping it up against a woman's armpit.

00:31:35.320 --> 00:31:36.160
 - That's true.

00:31:36.160 --> 00:31:37.000
 - I don't see why you would.

00:31:37.000 --> 00:31:39.400
 - Those crisps, they used to be the same price

00:31:39.400 --> 00:31:40.880
 as ready salted crisps,

00:31:40.880 --> 00:31:42.520
 but you still had to put extra work in.

00:31:42.520 --> 00:31:43.360
 - That's so weird.

00:31:43.360 --> 00:31:44.200
 - It was fun.

00:31:44.200 --> 00:31:45.040
 - Yeah, it was fun.

00:31:45.040 --> 00:31:46.840
 - But this is about compounds in their armpits,

00:31:46.840 --> 00:31:48.480
 by the way, this isn't just people sniffing them

00:31:48.480 --> 00:31:49.920
 and saying, "Oh, that's oniony."

00:31:49.920 --> 00:31:50.760
 - Okay.

00:31:50.760 --> 00:31:53.400
 - This is the compound that women's armpits generate

00:31:53.400 --> 00:31:55.200
 is something called as a thio alcohol,

00:31:55.200 --> 00:31:57.800
 which when it combines with a bacteria smells like onion,

00:31:57.800 --> 00:31:58.800
 and then men's sweat has--

00:31:58.800 --> 00:32:00.560
 - Would you say alcohol?

00:32:00.560 --> 00:32:03.280
 - Yeah, but don't go licking women's armpits for that.

00:32:03.280 --> 00:32:05.320
 Again, it's not worth it, I'll buy you a beer.

00:32:05.320 --> 00:32:07.160
 (laughing)

00:32:07.160 --> 00:32:09.740
 (upbeat music)

00:32:09.740 --> 00:32:14.080
 - Okay, that's it, that is all of our facts.

00:32:14.080 --> 00:32:15.720
 Thank you so much for listening.

00:32:15.720 --> 00:32:17.800

 @nosuchthing or our Facebook page.

00:32:34.680 --> 00:32:36.840
 No such thing as a fish or a website.

00:32:36.840 --> 00:32:38.560
 No such thing as a fish.com.

00:32:38.560 --> 00:32:40.760
 Do go there, it's got all of our previous episodes.

00:32:40.760 --> 00:32:43.360
 It's got links to our upcoming shows.

00:32:43.360 --> 00:32:44.640
 We are always doing live shows

00:32:44.640 --> 00:32:46.480
 to check it out if you ever wanna see us.

00:32:46.480 --> 00:32:48.880
 It has everything from book links.

00:32:48.880 --> 00:32:49.920
 It's just got it all.

00:32:49.920 --> 00:32:51.960
 It's where we put our things.

00:32:51.960 --> 00:32:54.120
 Okay, we'll be back again next week.

00:32:54.120 --> 00:32:55.800
 See you then, goodbye.

00:32:55.800 --> 00:32:58.380
 (upbeat music)

00:32:58.380 --> 00:33:00.960
 (upbeat music)

00:33:00.960 --> 00:33:30.960
