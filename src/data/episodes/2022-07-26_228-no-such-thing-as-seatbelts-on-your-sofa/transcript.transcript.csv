00:00:00,00:00:02,(percussive music)
00:00:02,00:00:17,"- Hey everyone, welcome to this week's episode of Fish."
00:00:17,00:00:19,"Before we get going, just wanna let you know,"
00:00:19,00:00:20,thank you for all your feedback
00:00:20,00:00:23,about last week's ultimate crossover episode.
00:00:23,00:00:24,It was very enjoyable to do.
00:00:24,00:00:28,"In fact, so much so, we've decided to do it again."
00:00:28,00:00:31,"Except this time, we've decided to crossover completely,"
00:00:31,00:00:34,"a full crossover, a 360 crossover."
00:00:34,00:00:36,"- Done, we messed up again, didn't we?"
00:00:36,00:00:41,"- We lost an entire episode, somehow."
00:00:41,00:00:45,"- So if you were in Bristol a few months ago,"
00:00:45,00:00:46,"quite a few months ago, you will have seen"
00:00:46,00:00:48,"an amazing show, guys."
00:00:48,00:00:50,"I gotta tell you, this was one of the best shows we ever did."
00:00:50,00:00:52,"Unfortunately, it doesn't seem like we recorded it."
00:00:52,00:00:55,"- So only you, Bristolians, will have the memory"
00:00:55,00:00:56,of that show.
00:00:56,00:00:59,"And then this is kind of the lesser version, you say?"
00:00:59,00:01:00,- Yeah.
00:01:00,00:01:01,"- Oh, it's still worth listening to."
00:01:01,00:01:02,- I would say.
00:01:02,00:01:05,"Definitely one for the completest, I'd say."
00:01:05,00:01:06,- Yes.
00:01:06,00:01:08,"- Yeah, it's amazing how negative you guys are."
00:01:08,00:01:10,We haven't even recorded it yet.
00:01:10,00:01:11,(all laughing)
00:01:11,00:01:13,- So enjoy this week's episode.
00:01:13,00:01:14,Here we go.
00:01:14,00:01:15,(upbeat music)
00:01:15,00:01:19,Hello and welcome to another episode of No Such Thing
00:01:19,00:01:21,"as a Fish, a weekly podcast coming to you"
00:01:21,00:01:23,from the QI offices in Covert Garden.
00:01:23,00:01:26,"My name is Dan Schreiber, and I'm sitting here"
00:01:26,00:01:29,"with Andrew Hunter Murray, James Harkin, and Anna Chazinski."
00:01:29,00:01:32,"And once again, we have gathered around the microphones"
00:01:32,00:01:35,with our four favorite facts from the last seven days.
00:01:35,00:01:38,"And in a particular order, here we go."
00:01:38,00:01:40,"Starting with you, Andy."
00:01:40,00:01:43,"- Okay, my fact is, it's about Bristol, actually."
00:01:43,00:01:44,I've just chosen completely at random
00:01:44,00:01:46,out of all the cities I could have chosen.
00:01:46,00:01:48,"And I learned it about four months ago,"
00:01:48,00:01:50,shortly before we performed in Bristol.
00:01:50,00:01:53,My fact this week is that the first hot air balloon flight
00:01:53,00:01:56,in Bristol was indoors.
00:01:56,00:01:59,And people at home have to imagine
00:01:59,00:02:01,the cheers and laughter of the Bristol crowd
00:02:01,00:02:02,when they first heard that.
00:02:02,00:02:04,- They went nuts when Andy said that.
00:02:04,00:02:06,My God.
00:02:06,00:02:08,"- So there's this firm in Bristol called Cameron Balloons,"
00:02:08,00:02:09,and it's the world's biggest balloon firm.
00:02:09,00:02:12,"Basically, Bristol is the capital of hot air ballooning"
00:02:12,00:02:14,"pretty much in the world, definitely in the UK."
00:02:14,00:02:15,- Yep.
00:02:15,00:02:17,"- And the first flight was in 1784,"
00:02:17,00:02:20,and you had to go indoors to see it.
00:02:20,00:02:22,And you had to pay a little amount to see it.
00:02:22,00:02:24,"And if you paid more, apparently you could see it filled up"
00:02:24,00:02:25,with air.
00:02:25,00:02:26,- Apparently it was a pricing structural way.
00:02:26,00:02:27,- Wait a minute.
00:02:27,00:02:29,"So the people who didn't pay much,"
00:02:29,00:02:30,they just saw a load of canvas.
00:02:30,00:02:32,"- It sounds like that, doesn't it?"
00:02:32,00:02:34,"I can't quite believe that, that's true."
00:02:34,00:02:35,- Was this new to people at the time?
00:02:35,00:02:40,"As in, how long did Balloons exist before this happens?"
00:02:40,00:02:41,- That's a great question.
00:02:41,00:02:41,- Really good question.
00:02:41,00:02:44,- So they had the Aztecs.
00:02:44,00:02:48,"They had, they made like Balloons"
00:02:48,00:02:50,out of animal intestines.
00:02:50,00:02:51,I think we know that.
00:02:51,00:02:54,And I remember reading once that they made Balloon animals
00:02:54,00:02:55,out of those intestines.
00:02:55,00:02:57,(laughing)
00:02:57,00:03:00,"But I don't know if that doesn't sound very true, does it?"
00:03:00,00:03:02,"- So, I mean, how big were the animals back then?"
00:03:02,00:03:03,- What do you mean?
00:03:03,00:03:05,"- As in, do they make like a full hot air balloon out"
00:03:05,00:03:06,of an animal?
00:03:06,00:03:06,"- No, no, no, sorry."
00:03:06,00:03:09,"So just Balloons in general, I'm saying about the history"
00:03:09,00:03:11,of not the history of hot air balloons.
00:03:11,00:03:12,(laughing)
00:03:12,00:03:14,"- And the Civil War, they definitely had hot air balloons"
00:03:14,00:03:18,'cause Lincoln had a hot air balloon balloon corp.
00:03:18,00:03:19,Corps.
00:03:19,00:03:20,- Cool.
00:03:20,00:03:21,- Corps.
00:03:21,00:03:24,- Just keep throwing guesses at the letters that you see.
00:03:24,00:03:25,- Corps.
00:03:25,00:03:26,- Corps.
00:03:26,00:03:27,(laughing)
00:03:27,00:03:30,"- Yeah, he had a balloon corp and they had seven Balloons"
00:03:30,00:03:33,and they used to go over and the Confederates actually
00:03:33,00:03:35,tried to build their own Balloons in retaliation
00:03:35,00:03:36,and then they stopped doing them
00:03:36,00:03:39,because people found them really easy to shoot.
00:03:39,00:03:40,It was quite an easy target.
00:03:40,00:03:42,So we know it goes back as far as the Civil War
00:03:42,00:03:43,"in America, at least."
00:03:43,00:03:45,"- Yeah, they were actually a huge deal"
00:03:45,00:03:47,in the 19th century hot air balloon flights.
00:03:47,00:03:50,And I think in 1897 there was an attempt
00:03:50,00:03:52,to reach the North Pole by balloon.
00:03:52,00:03:54,That was three Swedish people who tried to get there.
00:03:54,00:03:55,They disappeared.
00:03:55,00:03:56,No one knew what happened to them.
00:03:56,00:03:58,There were these reports of silk falling from the sky.
00:03:58,00:04:01,"And then randomly in 1930, 33 years later,"
00:04:01,00:04:04,they were found in this Thor by Whalers just by chance.
00:04:04,00:04:08,They found as the Thor came the bodies of these guys
00:04:08,00:04:09,and they'd crashed after three days
00:04:09,00:04:11,but they'd lived on these ice flows
00:04:11,00:04:13,and they'd eaten polar bears for--
00:04:13,00:04:16,"- Wow, that is hard cars, yeah."
00:04:16,00:04:16,- That's amazing.
00:04:16,00:04:19,- I reckon I'd go hungry before I decided to go for
00:04:19,00:04:21,"- Oh, look at that."
00:04:21,00:04:22,"- It was so sad though, 'cause they were convinced"
00:04:22,00:04:26,that they could steer their balloon over the North Pole.
00:04:26,00:04:28,And it was partly funded by Alfred Nobel.
00:04:28,00:04:29,"Their attempt, yeah."
00:04:29,00:04:32,And but unfortunately the drag ropes didn't work very well
00:04:32,00:04:34,and in a few minutes they fell off
00:04:34,00:04:35,so they had no way of steering.
00:04:35,00:04:37,So they lost lots of ballast
00:04:37,00:04:39,and they kept on just bumping along the ground
00:04:39,00:04:41,and leaking a bit and then rising a bit.
00:04:41,00:04:43,And it took them 65 hours to land
00:04:43,00:04:45,and they didn't get to the stores in time.
00:04:45,00:04:46,So it was sad.
00:04:46,00:04:47,- The other thing about eating polar bears
00:04:47,00:04:49,is their liver's contained so much vitamin A
00:04:49,00:04:51,that they're poisonous.
00:04:51,00:04:52,"- Yeah, that's awful."
00:04:52,00:04:54,"If you're diving vitamin A poisoning,"
00:04:54,00:04:55,want to survive the hot air balloon crash
00:04:55,00:04:57,onto an ice flow and then pour a polar bear
00:04:57,00:04:59,to death with your bare hands.
00:04:59,00:05:02,- This is quite cool about higher balloons.
00:05:02,00:05:05,So usually you're not allowed to fly in rain
00:05:05,00:05:08,"and so it's all weather dependent, isn't it,"
00:05:08,00:05:09,if anyone tries to fly.
00:05:09,00:05:11,They can't actually fly in wet weather.
00:05:11,00:05:13,I guess it's just not recommended.
00:05:13,00:05:15,"But when you do fly in wet weather,"
00:05:15,00:05:16,the rain gets caught in
00:05:16,00:05:19,and actually goes over the people inside the basket
00:05:19,00:05:22,so it makes its way into the...
00:05:22,00:05:23,"But because of the flames,"
00:05:23,00:05:25,it comes down like a hot shower.
00:05:25,00:05:28,So it's really warm water that drops on them.
00:05:28,00:05:31,"- That's nice. - Yeah, that's very cool."
00:05:31,00:05:33,Have you heard of splash and dash?
00:05:33,00:05:35,While we're talking about water and hot air ballooning?
00:05:35,00:05:36,- No.
00:05:36,00:05:36,- Splash and dash is a cool thing you can do
00:05:36,00:05:38,if you have a hot air balloon.
00:05:38,00:05:39,It's what you sink just low enough
00:05:39,00:05:42,to dip your toes into a lake and then climb up again.
00:05:42,00:05:43,- Oh cool.
00:05:43,00:05:44,- It's pretty risky.
00:05:44,00:05:46,- Your toe is below the bottom of the basket.
00:05:46,00:05:49,"- Well, there is a trend for ballooning"
00:05:49,00:05:50,with no basket these days.
00:05:50,00:05:52,- No way. - You have a sofa.
00:05:52,00:05:53,- You have a sofa.
00:05:53,00:05:54,- What?
00:05:54,00:05:55,- Yeah.
00:05:55,00:05:56,- No way.
00:05:56,00:05:56,- No way.
00:05:56,00:05:58,- It's not very common.
00:05:58,00:05:59,- It's a trend though.
00:05:59,00:06:01,- It's a trend.
00:06:01,00:06:03,"- You're serious people can go up in a sofa,"
00:06:03,00:06:04,"do they have to be strapped in, right?"
00:06:04,00:06:09,- I think it's really recommended that you try something.
00:06:09,00:06:10,"- I don't know though,"
00:06:10,00:06:12,because I never fall enough myselfer.
00:06:12,00:06:13,- That's true.
00:06:13,00:06:16,"- I mean, I don't know if that's true, but you look to me"
00:06:16,00:06:17,like the kind of guy who wouldn't.
00:06:17,00:06:20,- They protect the things that are easy to kind of sail.
00:06:20,00:06:21,"- That's true, yeah?"
00:06:21,00:06:23,"- No, if it's swinging in high winds from a balloon"
00:06:23,00:06:25,"as a thousand feet up,"
00:06:25,00:06:27,"I don't have belts on my sofa,"
00:06:27,00:06:29,so I think mine wouldn't be safe at all.
00:06:29,00:06:31,"- Well, I've had belts fitted to all my soapers at home"
00:06:31,00:06:32,"and just in case,"
00:06:32,00:06:35,and they save my life on countless occasions.
00:06:35,00:06:38,"Well, speaking of no baskets for a hot air balloon,"
00:06:38,00:06:43,"have you heard of, they're called smoke hot air balloons?"
00:06:43,00:06:46,It was a carnival attraction that used to happen.
00:06:46,00:06:48,"So this is during the 1800s,"
00:06:48,00:06:49,"and there's footage that you can see of this online,"
00:06:49,00:06:51,and it's honestly incredible.
00:06:51,00:06:53,This was a daredevil thing.
00:06:53,00:06:55,"So what they would do is,"
00:06:55,00:06:58,daredevil's would attach themselves by a rope
00:06:58,00:07:01,"to an inflating hot air balloon with no baskets,"
00:07:01,00:07:02,so simply the balloon.
00:07:02,00:07:05,So the balloon would completely fill up.
00:07:05,00:07:05,"They would untether it,"
00:07:05,00:07:07,"and it would rock it off into the sky,"
00:07:07,00:07:10,and these people would just be dragged behind it
00:07:10,00:07:11,"on the end of the ropes,"
00:07:11,00:07:13,and would fly up after it.
00:07:13,00:07:14,"And when they got to a certain height,"
00:07:14,00:07:17,"they would loosen themselves from the rope,"
00:07:17,00:07:20,fall down and parachute back to Earth.
00:07:20,00:07:22,"- Very cool. - Well, it's absolutely incredible."
00:07:22,00:07:23,You see them lob up in these people.
00:07:23,00:07:25,"They're surrounded by people in the videos,"
00:07:25,00:07:28,and they just go fong and disappear off into the air.
00:07:28,00:07:30,"- But you have to loosen yourself up before it gets too high,"
00:07:30,00:07:32,"presumably. - Yeah, I think you obviously know"
00:07:32,00:07:33,when it's you've had enough.
00:07:33,00:07:34,- Okay. - Yeah.
00:07:34,00:07:38,- I thought you were going to say they shot the balloon down.
00:07:38,00:07:38,Why?
00:07:38,00:07:41,(laughing)
00:07:41,00:07:43,'Cause I didn't imagine that they had a parachute on
00:07:43,00:07:44,when you were describing it.
00:07:44,00:07:46,So I was thinking how would I get myself out of this one?
00:07:46,00:07:47,- Yeah.
00:07:47,00:07:49,"- And I would have, my first choice would have been a gun"
00:07:49,00:07:51,instead of a parachute.
00:07:51,00:07:53,(laughing)
00:07:53,00:07:55,- What one item do you want to take up from you?
00:07:55,00:07:57,(laughing)
00:07:57,00:07:59,- I read a brilliant account.
00:07:59,00:08:01,"This is actually the source of 1838,"
00:08:01,00:08:03,"but it was about something that happened in 1785,"
00:08:03,00:08:05,"and it was when Jean-Pierre Blanchard,"
00:08:05,00:08:07,"who was one of the first people to go up in a hot air balloon,"
00:08:07,00:08:10,"went up, he went 6,000 feet up,"
00:08:10,00:08:12,"and then he dropped from his hot air balloon,"
00:08:12,00:08:14,"a dog attached to a parachute,"
00:08:14,00:08:16,"just to kind of see what would happen,"
00:08:16,00:08:19,and this whirlwind apparently swept the dog away
00:08:19,00:08:22,"above the clouds, so it kind of disappeared,"
00:08:22,00:08:24,and Blanchard is in his balloon.
00:08:24,00:08:27,"This is what the account says, handed down through the ages."
00:08:27,00:08:29,"Blanchard was in his balloon,"
00:08:29,00:08:32,and he met the dog in his parachute above the clouds.
00:08:32,00:08:33,- This is rubbish.
00:08:33,00:08:35,- Do you remember that thing with that sauce?
00:08:35,00:08:36,(laughing)
00:08:36,00:08:37,- He got the loop the loop guy.
00:08:37,00:08:38,"- Yeah, which is true."
00:08:38,00:08:40,"- He fell out of his plane during a loop the loop,"
00:08:40,00:08:43,and then fell back into it once it had finished doing the loop.
00:08:43,00:08:45,"- Yeah, so he was upside down, he fell down,"
00:08:45,00:08:47,"he thought he was doomed,"
00:08:47,00:08:48,"but his plane, which was mid-loop the loop,"
00:08:48,00:08:50,met him at the bottom.
00:08:50,00:08:52,- So remember how obviously fells that was?
00:08:52,00:08:53,"- Look, your thing sounds similar."
00:08:53,00:08:55,- Dan's defies physics.
00:08:55,00:08:57,"Mine, imagine a really small dog,"
00:08:57,00:08:59,"like a little terrier, with a parachute in high winds."
00:08:59,00:09:01,"It could be swept away into the clouds,"
00:09:01,00:09:04,"and then old Blanchard saw his dog above the clouds,"
00:09:04,00:09:07,who barked with joy apparently at seeing his master.
00:09:07,00:09:08,"He tried to grab him,"
00:09:08,00:09:10,"and they both had landed 12 minutes later,"
00:09:10,00:09:12,separately after which the dog ran away.
00:09:12,00:09:14,"- When you say barked with joy,"
00:09:14,00:09:16,do you not mean barked in absolute terror?
00:09:16,00:09:17,"- barked in like,"
00:09:17,00:09:19,"""Why the fuck do you just drop me out of that balloon, mate?"""
00:09:19,00:09:20,- He then shits himself with joy.
00:09:20,00:09:23,(laughing)
00:09:23,00:09:26,"- Ben Franklin patented a balloon-related thing,"
00:09:26,00:09:28,like he painted it everything else.
00:09:28,00:09:31,"- He patented a refrigerator that tethered to a balloon,"
00:09:31,00:09:34,"and it was meant to lift food up into where the air was cool,"
00:09:34,00:09:36,and that's how you'd refrigerate your food.
00:09:36,00:09:37,- Why?
00:09:37,00:09:38,- I have heard of that before.
00:09:38,00:09:39,- That is so cool.
00:09:39,00:09:40,"- It's inconvenient, though."
00:09:40,00:09:41,- It is.
00:09:41,00:09:43,"If you're going for a late-night snack, it's..."
00:09:43,00:09:44,- But what you have to do is pull it down.
00:09:44,00:09:46,You just kind of winch it back down.
00:09:46,00:09:47,- Yeah.
00:09:47,00:09:48,"- You get your food out,"
00:09:48,00:09:49,and then you let it go back up again.
00:09:49,00:09:50,"- Again, I was thinking of shooting it down,"
00:09:50,00:09:51,I feel like.
00:09:51,00:09:52,- By the anti-thing.
00:09:52,00:09:53,(laughing)
00:09:53,00:09:55,- These eggs are broken again.
00:09:55,00:09:56,(laughing)
00:09:56,00:09:59,(upbeat music)
00:10:00,00:10:02,(upbeat music)
00:10:02,00:10:04,"- Okay, it is time for fact number two,"
00:10:04,00:10:06,and that is Chuzinski.
00:10:06,00:10:08,"- My fact this week is that in rage rooms,"
00:10:08,00:10:10,"where people pay to smash things up,"
00:10:10,00:10:13,the things people want to smash up the most are printers.
00:10:13,00:10:15,"Yeah, they hate them."
00:10:15,00:10:16,They hate printers.
00:10:16,00:10:18,"So, rage rooms are these things"
00:10:18,00:10:20,that are kind of popping up all over the place.
00:10:20,00:10:22,"Quite a few of them in America and in Canada,"
00:10:22,00:10:23,"where you pay to go,"
00:10:23,00:10:26,"and you can either smash up their possessions,"
00:10:26,00:10:28,"so they provide a bunch of stuff,"
00:10:28,00:10:29,"or you can bring your own stuff,"
00:10:29,00:10:31,and they're becoming increasingly popular.
00:10:31,00:10:33,"- Better to do someone else's stuff, right?"
00:10:33,00:10:34,"- Well, I think it depends."
00:10:34,00:10:35,How much you just like that person.
00:10:35,00:10:37,- If you just like your own stuff a lot.
00:10:37,00:10:38,"- Yeah, well, why did you pay it then?"
00:10:38,00:10:40,"- I know, but let's say you've got a pen"
00:10:40,00:10:40,that you really don't like.
00:10:40,00:10:42,- You're not gonna smash up a pen.
00:10:42,00:10:45,- That is the most pussy rage room attendant
00:10:45,00:10:46,I've ever seen.
00:10:46,00:10:47,- What?
00:10:47,00:10:48,- You turning up with one bike.
00:10:48,00:10:49,- You're right.
00:10:49,00:10:50,(laughing)
00:10:50,00:10:51,"- I'm now with this guy, baby."
00:10:51,00:10:52,- He keeps leaking.
00:10:52,00:10:54,- I do it really psychologically though.
00:10:54,00:10:57,I put it in a chair and then I shine a light in it's nib.
00:10:57,00:10:58,(laughing)
00:10:58,00:11:00,- I asked you to let a question before I beat it up.
00:11:00,00:11:02,(laughing)
00:11:02,00:11:03,"- I'm holding a pen, I'm sorry,"
00:11:03,00:11:05,I've got a poor imagination.
00:11:05,00:11:07,- I love at the end of the hour
00:11:07,00:11:09,you come up slightly beat up somehow.
00:11:09,00:11:11,(laughing)
00:11:11,00:11:13,- Just got stuff drawn over the space.
00:11:13,00:11:14,(laughing)
00:11:14,00:11:16,- Pen strolls out nonchalantly out of you.
00:11:16,00:11:17,(laughing)
00:11:17,00:11:18,Hails a cab.
00:11:18,00:11:20,(laughing)
00:11:20,00:11:21,"- But no, this is a thing if you go through"
00:11:21,00:11:23,the rage room site.
00:11:23,00:11:25,There's a one called Battle Sports in Toronto
00:11:25,00:11:28,that says it goes through 15 printers a week.
00:11:28,00:11:31,The same in New York and the fragment room and Singapore.
00:11:31,00:11:33,They also printers are almost sold after objects.
00:11:33,00:11:34,We need to provide lots of them.
00:11:34,00:11:36,People want to break them up.
00:11:36,00:11:38,- I like this in America in New York.
00:11:38,00:11:40,"There's the Reckon Club and the Reckon Club,"
00:11:40,00:11:43,"it has, you know, you can get packages that you can buy."
00:11:43,00:11:44,So I want it all.
00:11:44,00:11:47,"It's a package you can get, which is $149."
00:11:47,00:11:49,You can even buy gift certificates for people.
00:11:49,00:11:51,"So, you know, both they presence,"
00:11:51,00:11:53,go for an hour in the rage room.
00:11:53,00:11:54,- They should have called it the Reckfast Club.
00:11:54,00:11:56,"- Yes, they should have."
00:11:56,00:11:56,Very nice.
00:11:56,00:11:57,- Why didn't they?
00:11:57,00:11:58,- We should start our own.
00:11:58,00:12:00,You and your pen's only.
00:12:00,00:12:02,(all laughing)
00:12:02,00:12:04,"- Yeah, so what's nice about this is it's the same,"
00:12:04,00:12:06,"obviously, like every rage room you go in"
00:12:06,00:12:08,"and you destroy stuff, but what I particularly like"
00:12:08,00:12:11,"is when they started, there was a guy who runs it"
00:12:11,00:12:14,"called Mr. Daily or Dally, D-A-L-Y."
00:12:14,00:12:16,"- Dally, he's got Tom Daley, I think, actually."
00:12:16,00:12:17,"- Oh, is he, Mr. Tom Daley."
00:12:17,00:12:19,"So he, when he was in there and they say"
00:12:19,00:12:21,"this was an early setback, he was in the room"
00:12:21,00:12:23,showing a couple of all the things
00:12:23,00:12:26,"that they could do via his laptop, a video."
00:12:26,00:12:27,"And then he left the room, but he accidentally left"
00:12:27,00:12:29,"the laptop in there, he smashed it up."
00:12:29,00:12:31,(all laughing)
00:12:31,00:12:33,"Yeah, so he came back in there, the other guy was like,"
00:12:33,00:12:33,"""Ah!"""
00:12:33,00:12:34,"And he didn't tell them, 'cause he thought,"
00:12:34,00:12:36,"""Oh, I don't want to ruin their experience."""
00:12:36,00:12:38,"But he, as of then, started labeling everything"
00:12:38,00:12:39,"as, ""Don't smash this."""
00:12:39,00:12:42,"- I went on the Wikipedia for rage rooms,"
00:12:42,00:12:43,"but I did it about four months ago,"
00:12:43,00:12:46,so it might have been changed by now.
00:12:46,00:12:48,But they said that the concept of an anger room
00:12:48,00:12:52,"is at least 20, at least 2000 years old."
00:12:52,00:12:52,- Is it?
00:12:52,00:12:54,"- Yeah, but that's what Wikipedia says,"
00:12:54,00:12:55,and who are we to doubt them?
00:12:55,00:12:56,- What are they saying about this?
00:12:56,00:12:59,"- They say it was Queen Kaikei,"
00:12:59,00:13:01,"who in an old book was said that she was going to,"
00:13:01,00:13:06,"the palace anger room, and actually it was a sulking chamber"
00:13:06,00:13:07,when I looked it up.
00:13:07,00:13:08,That's how it's usually translated.
00:13:08,00:13:10,- Apparently it was like a dark room
00:13:10,00:13:12,where you would lie down and sulk.
00:13:12,00:13:13,- Mm-hmm.
00:13:13,00:13:14,"- Yeah, so not really arranged."
00:13:14,00:13:16,- I do like the sound of that though.
00:13:16,00:13:19,"- Yeah, yeah, 'cause people rage manifest differently,"
00:13:19,00:13:20,doesn't it?
00:13:20,00:13:21,Some people just want to lie down in the dark
00:13:21,00:13:24,and be really pissed off with the world.
00:13:24,00:13:26,Some of us like to smash our exes stuff.
00:13:26,00:13:27,"Actually the most,"
00:13:27,00:13:31,the most I say that because I think the most common thing
00:13:31,00:13:33,for people who do bring in their own things
00:13:33,00:13:34,are people who've had a breakup
00:13:34,00:13:36,and they bring in all their exes old stuff.
00:13:36,00:13:38,This is what the Toronto play said.
00:13:38,00:13:39,"So it's said for $20 extra,"
00:13:39,00:13:41,you can bring your own stuff to smash.
00:13:41,00:13:43,"And the founder said that by far and away,"
00:13:43,00:13:45,the most common thing to do is to bring in your exes stuff.
00:13:45,00:13:47,"And he said, ""The people often come in"
00:13:47,00:13:49,"and you'll hear them screaming and shouting in there,"
00:13:49,00:13:51,"things like, oh, you think you're so good?"
00:13:51,00:13:54,"Argg, and then you'll hear us smash."""
00:13:54,00:13:55,- You think you're always right?
00:13:55,00:13:56,"- I think that's pronounced ""Arg."""
00:13:56,00:13:58,(laughing)
00:13:58,00:14:00,"- How do you spell ""Arg"" then?"
00:14:00,00:14:01,Is it without the age?
00:14:01,00:14:02,- I don't think there is a word.
00:14:02,00:14:03,"- Who says ""Arg""?"
00:14:03,00:14:04,- Pirates.
00:14:04,00:14:06,"- No, they don't, they go, ""Arg."""
00:14:06,00:14:07,- Oh yeah.
00:14:07,00:14:10,"- Oh, we've not been hearing the end of their sentence."
00:14:10,00:14:12,(laughing)
00:14:12,00:14:15,- One of the first ones that was set up in Dallas in 2011
00:14:15,00:14:17,by a lady called Donna Alexander.
00:14:17,00:14:20,And she just started charging $5 to smash things
00:14:20,00:14:22,that she collected from curbs in the area.
00:14:22,00:14:23,- Herica.
00:14:23,00:14:24,- She just sort of picked it up.
00:14:24,00:14:25,So it was very ad hoc at the beginning.
00:14:25,00:14:27,"And then she'd get people knocking on her door,"
00:14:27,00:14:28,"kind of like a fight club saying,"
00:14:28,00:14:30,"""Is this where you go to smash stuff up?"""
00:14:30,00:14:33,And her insurer had to invent an entirely new category
00:14:33,00:14:34,just for her.
00:14:34,00:14:36,"- Oh, very exciting."
00:14:36,00:14:37,- Yeah.
00:14:37,00:14:38,- And what do you mean by just picking stuff up
00:14:38,00:14:40,like as in flight tipping?
00:14:40,00:14:41,"- You know when people leave things out,"
00:14:41,00:14:43,"exactly flight tipping, like leave an old fridge out"
00:14:43,00:14:47,or drop a lot of pens that they don't want anymore
00:14:47,00:14:50,for the faulty kind of thing.
00:14:50,00:14:50,- That's really cool.
00:14:50,00:14:52,- Yeah.
00:14:52,00:14:53,- Stuff on printers?
00:14:53,00:14:54,- Oh yeah.
00:14:54,00:14:55,- I was reading about printer jams
00:14:55,00:14:58,and everyone finds them very annoying.
00:14:58,00:15:00,Apart from people who work in printers
00:15:00,00:15:02,who find them really exciting.
00:15:02,00:15:07,I say it's the it's the it's the elemental struggle
00:15:07,00:15:08,between the natural and the mechanical
00:15:08,00:15:10,because paper is made out of trees
00:15:10,00:15:15,and printers are made out of metal and shit and plastic.
00:15:15,00:15:16,- I think the ultimate challenge
00:15:16,00:15:17,is throwing a dog with a parachute
00:15:17,00:15:21,out of a hot air balloon and then catching it again.
00:15:21,00:15:24,- Do you guys know about the first printer ever to go into space?
00:15:24,00:15:26,- No.
00:15:26,00:15:29,- This was a printer that was sent up on the ISS in 1998.
00:15:29,00:15:32,"Sorry, this was the first color printer ever to go into space."
00:15:32,00:15:33,(laughing)
00:15:33,00:15:38,So it was sent up in 1998 with a discovery mission
00:15:38,00:15:41,and it was used solely to make Halloween masks.
00:15:41,00:15:42,So it was sent up.
00:15:42,00:15:43,It was kind of a secret thing.
00:15:43,00:15:45,"So John Glenn, who was by then a senator,"
00:15:45,00:15:46,was on that mission.
00:15:46,00:15:50,But he'd been the third person I think to orbit the Earth
00:15:50,00:15:52,in 1962.
00:15:52,00:15:54,And so he was this big space hero by that point.
00:15:54,00:15:56,"And so on that 1998 mission,"
00:15:56,00:15:58,the whole crew printed color portraits of him
00:15:58,00:16:00,off this floppy disk and they made these portraits
00:16:00,00:16:01,into Halloween masks.
00:16:01,00:16:03,And then they all went around pretending to be John Glenn
00:16:03,00:16:05,in a nod to his greatness.
00:16:05,00:16:06,- Cool.
00:16:06,00:16:08,I'd print out a full alien costume
00:16:08,00:16:10,and then sell it to take it to myself
00:16:10,00:16:11,and then freak my crew mates out.
00:16:11,00:16:13,- Do you think they'd fall for that?
00:16:13,00:16:15,Because I don't think anyone was floating around
00:16:15,00:16:16,going oh my god it's John Glenn.
00:16:16,00:16:19,"Oh my god it's John Glenn, oh my god it's John Glenn."
00:16:19,00:16:20,- That's true.
00:16:20,00:16:23,(upbeat music)
00:16:23,00:16:29,"- Okay, it is time for fact number three."
00:16:29,00:16:30,And that is my fact.
00:16:30,00:16:33,My fact this week is one of the first things
00:16:33,00:16:35,that McDonald's founder Ray Crock did
00:16:35,00:16:38,when he bought the baseball team San Diego Padres
00:16:38,00:16:41,was to sign a player called Big Mac.
00:16:41,00:16:42,- Very good.
00:16:42,00:16:44,Did he do it because he was the founder of McDonald's
00:16:44,00:16:46,or was he just a good baseball player?
00:16:46,00:16:47,- Big Mac was a great baseball player.
00:16:47,00:16:50,Willie MacCovie was his real name.
00:16:50,00:16:53,He was a very good player and obviously Ray Crock
00:16:53,00:16:58,who built McDonald's from a very tiny brother operation
00:16:58,00:17:01,of the McDonald brothers into the global success it was.
00:17:01,00:17:03,"Had an eye for franchising, for merchandising,"
00:17:03,00:17:04,for commercialization.
00:17:04,00:17:06,He saw that by getting Big Mac in
00:17:06,00:17:09,he could do a lot of cross promotion.
00:17:09,00:17:11,"So for example, during the first season"
00:17:11,00:17:13,they did Big Mac Sundays.
00:17:13,00:17:15,So the idea would be that you could take a ticket stub
00:17:15,00:17:18,and get a free Big Mac after a match
00:17:18,00:17:20,if the Padres had won.
00:17:20,00:17:22,Unfortunately when the promotion started
00:17:22,00:17:23,they lost 11 straight home games.
00:17:23,00:17:26,And so as a result they had to change it to
00:17:26,00:17:29,whether they win or lose you get a free Big Mac.
00:17:29,00:17:30,- Yeah they were terrible weren't they
00:17:30,00:17:31,when he first took over.
00:17:31,00:17:32,- Yeah.
00:17:32,00:17:34,- Was there not a thing about him
00:17:34,00:17:36,shouting at them on the pitch or something like that?
00:17:36,00:17:39,"- The first match he went, he was very excited"
00:17:39,00:17:41,because the idea of him signing this new player
00:17:41,00:17:43,and the fact that Ray Crock had taken over it.
00:17:43,00:17:45,He got the attendance right up.
00:17:45,00:17:50,"They, for their opener, they drew 39,000 people"
00:17:50,00:17:51,but they totally sucked in the match.
00:17:51,00:17:53,And as a result he went into the booth
00:17:53,00:17:55,where the commentators were commentating on the match
00:17:55,00:17:59,"took over the Tannoy and he said,"
00:17:59,00:18:00,"""I have good news and bad news."""
00:18:00,00:18:03,"The good news is that the Dodgers drew 31,000"
00:18:03,00:18:06,"for their opener and we've drawn 39,000 for ours."
00:18:06,00:18:08,The bad news is that this is the most stupid
00:18:08,00:18:10,baseball playing I have ever seen.
00:18:10,00:18:13,He said that to the players heard the fans
00:18:13,00:18:15,"and the fans cheered, they loved it."
00:18:15,00:18:17,They loved that he was being honest.
00:18:17,00:18:19,And then someone ran on the field of Strieker
00:18:19,00:18:21,"and he yelled, ""Get that Strieker off the field."
00:18:21,00:18:22,"""Throw him in jail."""
00:18:22,00:18:25,So he was just commenting to the whole stadium
00:18:25,00:18:27,"of 39,000 people his thoughts."
00:18:27,00:18:28,It was amazing.
00:18:28,00:18:30,- He was angry.
00:18:30,00:18:30,- Yeah.
00:18:30,00:18:33,"Just before we did this show in Bristol,"
00:18:33,00:18:35,"the night before, or the day before,"
00:18:35,00:18:39,I watched the founder for research for this.
00:18:39,00:18:41,I was a really good film about Ray Crock
00:18:41,00:18:43,but I can't remember any of it now.
00:18:43,00:18:44,(laughing)
00:18:44,00:18:44,- Good story.
00:18:44,00:18:47,- I think I remember is that when the brothers
00:18:47,00:18:50,"who founded McDonald's, so this is not Ray Crock,"
00:18:50,00:18:53,"their idea was called the method, I think."
00:18:53,00:18:56,And they worked out the size of their kitchen
00:18:56,00:18:57,"and where everything went,"
00:18:57,00:18:59,so there was a most efficient possible way
00:18:59,00:19:00,of running a kitchen.
00:19:00,00:19:02,And the way they did it is they went to a tennis court
00:19:02,00:19:05,and they had chalk and they drew all the different
00:19:05,00:19:07,"possibilities and they got people,"
00:19:07,00:19:09,hired people for very little money
00:19:09,00:19:12,"to try out pretending to cook all these burgers,"
00:19:12,00:19:13,"pretending to do milkshakes,"
00:19:13,00:19:16,pretending to do fries until they got the exact one.
00:19:16,00:19:18,And they did this for days and days.
00:19:18,00:19:20,They eventually found the right one
00:19:20,00:19:22,and then that night it rained
00:19:22,00:19:25,and all of their chalk marks got washed away
00:19:25,00:19:26,and they had to do the whole experiment.
00:19:26,00:19:27,- Oh no.
00:19:27,00:19:29,- The whole sort of the design of the kitchen
00:19:29,00:19:30,like the choreography.
00:19:30,00:19:31,That's very cool.
00:19:31,00:19:32,- Oh wow.
00:19:32,00:19:34,- Do you know that Ray Crock was in the same
00:19:34,00:19:36,Ray Cross company in the first world war
00:19:36,00:19:38,driving ambulances as Walt Disney?
00:19:38,00:19:39,- Wow.
00:19:39,00:19:40,- Was it really?
00:19:40,00:19:42,- And they both went on to be very successful
00:19:42,00:19:46,"in their own ways, and they both lied about their age"
00:19:46,00:19:47,to get in.
00:19:47,00:19:48,- Really?
00:19:48,00:19:49,- Yeah.
00:19:49,00:19:51,"- He had a really weird relationship with his wife,"
00:19:51,00:19:51,didn't he?
00:19:51,00:19:52,- Did he?
00:19:52,00:19:53,- Joan Crock.
00:19:53,00:19:56,"So she, Crock suddenly becomes a funny asser name"
00:19:56,00:19:58,when he was actually a Joan.
00:19:58,00:20:01,So I think first of all they were married
00:20:01,00:20:02,when he said he wanted to buy the Padres
00:20:02,00:20:05,and she said is that a monastery?
00:20:05,00:20:08,And then it seems like they must have had some tensions
00:20:08,00:20:11,'cause first of all she launched an alcoholism charity
00:20:11,00:20:13,"called Operation Cork, which is Crock,"
00:20:13,00:20:16,his surname spelled backwards.
00:20:16,00:20:17,And she used to produce TV dramas
00:20:17,00:20:19,about the impact of alcoholism on families
00:20:19,00:20:21,'cause I think he was an alcoholic.
00:20:21,00:20:23,So she said she raised awareness about that.
00:20:23,00:20:27,But also when he died in 1984 she immediately gave away
00:20:27,00:20:29,the estate and distributed all the money
00:20:29,00:20:31,to all these like some great charities.
00:20:31,00:20:33,And also she gave a million dollars
00:20:33,00:20:36,"to the Democratic Party, which is a slap in the face"
00:20:36,00:20:38,because Ray Crock was a massive Republican.
00:20:38,00:20:42,He'd given like quarter of a million to Nixon's re-election campaign.
00:20:42,00:20:47,"So yeah, she sort of undid his legacy in some ways."
00:20:47,00:20:49,- And she was amazing for the baseball team as well
00:20:49,00:20:51,'cause after he passed away she took over
00:20:51,00:20:53,but she knew virtually nothing about baseball.
00:20:53,00:20:55,But in that first season after she took over
00:20:55,00:20:57,her team made it to the World Series.
00:20:57,00:20:59,- Well it seems like she knew a lot about baseball
00:20:59,00:21:00,on like her husband.
00:21:00,00:21:01,(laughs)
00:21:01,00:21:02,"- Well she learned, yeah she learned on the go,"
00:21:02,00:21:04,yeah he definitely didn't like it.
00:21:04,00:21:07,He at one point after the Padres had lost 102 games
00:21:07,00:21:09,said I bought the team to have some fun
00:21:09,00:21:12,but it's proving to be about as enjoyable as a wake
00:21:12,00:21:16,"your own, that was his public comment about his own team."
00:21:16,00:21:18,- Your guy called Big Mac.
00:21:18,00:21:19,- Yeah.
00:21:19,00:21:20,- I went on the internet and searched
00:21:20,00:21:23,for some other names of baseball players
00:21:23,00:21:27,and I found that there was a guy called Thomas Lewis Fries
00:21:27,00:21:30,and another one called Philip Douglas Koch.
00:21:30,00:21:34,So you can have Big Mac fries and coke with the players.
00:21:34,00:21:39,"Some other players, Cannonball, Ticcom, Jolly Dick Shot."
00:21:39,00:21:40,- Lovely.
00:21:40,00:21:44,- His nickname was Ugly so people called him Ugly Dick Shot
00:21:44,00:21:46,and Wonderful Mounds.
00:21:46,00:21:47,- No.
00:21:47,00:21:48,- His name is nice.
00:21:48,00:21:50,"- Wonderful, sorry that's a nickname surely."
00:21:50,00:21:51,"- His first name was Wonderful,"
00:21:51,00:21:53,his second name was Terrific.
00:21:53,00:21:55,- What?
00:21:55,00:21:56,- No.
00:21:56,00:21:56,- Wonderful Terrific.
00:21:56,00:21:58,- Actually Wonderful Mounds.
00:21:58,00:21:59,- Okay.
00:21:59,00:22:01,- I mean it wasn't the surname that I was quibbling with.
00:22:01,00:22:03,(laughs)
00:22:03,00:22:04,- Wonderful Terrific Mounds.
00:22:04,00:22:05,"That's a good name, isn't it?"
00:22:05,00:22:07,"- Yes, it's a lovely."
00:22:07,00:22:10,- Well there's a guy in basketball called Metaworld Peace.
00:22:10,00:22:11,That's his name.
00:22:11,00:22:13,He's playing for China now
00:22:13,00:22:15,and he's changed his name to Panda.
00:22:15,00:22:15,- Okay.
00:22:15,00:22:17,- He just keeps going for the name changes.
00:22:17,00:22:20,- This is an American footballer called Lion King.
00:22:20,00:22:22,"- Sir, Lion King, first name Lion."
00:22:22,00:22:22,"- Yeah, cool."
00:22:22,00:22:23,- That's so good.
00:22:23,00:22:26,- Did you know chicken nuggets were almost onion nuggets?
00:22:26,00:22:28,"They trial the two, not realizing"
00:22:28,00:22:29,that people might prefer chicken.
00:22:29,00:22:30,They almost made them onions.
00:22:30,00:22:32,"- That might be nice, like an onion bargie."
00:22:32,00:22:33,- I think so.
00:22:33,00:22:34,- Or an onion ring.
00:22:34,00:22:35,"- Yeah, absolutely."
00:22:35,00:22:37,"- It's like an onion ring, but it's an onion ball."
00:22:37,00:22:38,"- Yeah, fine."
00:22:38,00:22:40,"- It's like an onion bargie, in fact."
00:22:40,00:22:41,"- Yeah, yeah."
00:22:41,00:22:42,(laughs)
00:22:42,00:22:43,Yeah.
00:22:43,00:22:44,There's a point.
00:22:44,00:22:47,Do you know there's a secret rebel McDonald's operating
00:22:47,00:22:48,in India?
00:22:48,00:22:49,"- Ah, this is very cool."
00:22:49,00:22:50,- I need to blow in their cover.
00:22:50,00:22:52,"- Yeah, well sorry guys."
00:22:52,00:22:56,There was a big kerfuffle between McDonald's global
00:22:56,00:22:57,and the Indian version of McDonald's.
00:22:57,00:22:59,- Do they make chicken bargies?
00:22:59,00:23:01,- I don't know if they do.
00:23:01,00:23:02,I hope they do.
00:23:02,00:23:04,"They do do a thing called McSpicy Peneer,"
00:23:04,00:23:06,"which is very popular, it sells out every day,"
00:23:06,00:23:07,but they canceled their franchise agreement
00:23:07,00:23:09,with 150 restaurants.
00:23:09,00:23:12,"They said, ""Oh, it's not working out for whatever reason."""
00:23:12,00:23:15,"And the restaurants kept on going, selling the food."
00:23:15,00:23:15,- Right.
00:23:15,00:23:17,- And no one stopped them or intervened.
00:23:17,00:23:19,"And they've left up the golden archers and everything,"
00:23:19,00:23:21,and they're still trading under the McDonald's name.
00:23:21,00:23:21,Yeah.
00:23:21,00:23:23,"- Yeah, the archers aren't always golden."
00:23:23,00:23:26,"There are a few exceptions,"
00:23:26,00:23:29,one of which is in Sedona in Arizona
00:23:29,00:23:32,"and their turquoise, why, get any guesses?"
00:23:32,00:23:33,Why?
00:23:33,00:23:35,"- 'Cause the yellowness blends into the desert,"
00:23:35,00:23:36,so you can't see it.
00:23:36,00:23:37,- Exactly.
00:23:37,00:23:39,"- No, it was, it was actually said,"
00:23:39,00:23:41,it sort of clashed too much with it.
00:23:41,00:23:42,"- Oh, so the opposite."
00:23:42,00:23:43,"- Yeah, but yeah."
00:23:43,00:23:45,You're the right kind of line.
00:23:45,00:23:46,"So yeah, the government said,"
00:23:46,00:23:48,"look, that kind of clashes with our desert."
00:23:48,00:23:50,"It looks silly, do something else."
00:23:50,00:23:50,Yeah.
00:23:50,00:23:55,- I read that the guy who created the golden archers
00:23:55,00:23:57,was offered a deal very early on in the day
00:23:57,00:23:58,"of a cut of it forever on,"
00:23:58,00:24:01,"or a one off payment, which was a very low sum."
00:24:01,00:24:02,- They always take the very low sum.
00:24:02,00:24:04,"- Yeah, they take the low sum."
00:24:04,00:24:05,"- They always go in and they say,"
00:24:05,00:24:07,"well, offer you this very low sum."
00:24:07,00:24:09,"- I love you, money for the rest of your life"
00:24:09,00:24:10,and they always take it.
00:24:10,00:24:11,- Yeah.
00:24:11,00:24:12,"- They never even specify the low sum, do they?"
00:24:12,00:24:14,"They just say, very low sum, do you want it?"
00:24:14,00:24:16,(laughing)
00:24:16,00:24:18,(upbeat music)
00:24:18,00:24:24,"- Okay, it is time for a final fact of the show"
00:24:24,00:24:25,and that is James.
00:24:25,00:24:27,"- Okay, my fact this week is that"
00:24:27,00:24:32,the yellow-billed ox-pecker bird sleeps in giraffe's armpits.
00:24:32,00:24:34,- Mmm. - It's so cool.
00:24:34,00:24:34,- Nice.
00:24:34,00:24:35,- We've known for a long time
00:24:35,00:24:38,that they kind of hang out on these African animals
00:24:38,00:24:41,like giraffe and water buffalo and stuff like that.
00:24:41,00:24:43,But they've only just found out that they stay there
00:24:43,00:24:45,overnight as well.
00:24:45,00:24:48,And that comes from a multi-year camera trap study
00:24:48,00:24:51,"in Tanzania, Serengeti National Park."
00:24:51,00:24:53,And so they're putting the cameras on these animals
00:24:53,00:24:54,in the middle of the night
00:24:54,00:24:56,and they found that the birds stay there.
00:24:56,00:24:58,And it seems that usually they stay there
00:24:58,00:25:00,and they have this symbiotic relationship
00:25:00,00:25:02,where they eat all the little bugs
00:25:02,00:25:04,that live in the giraffe's armpits
00:25:04,00:25:07,and they get the protection of the giraffe.
00:25:07,00:25:09,- Not just the armpits as well.
00:25:09,00:25:10,"- Yes. - The legs, it's all the pits."
00:25:10,00:25:13,- The crotch is crotch every one of the pits.
00:25:13,00:25:16,"- Okay, so you can get up to seven birds"
00:25:16,00:25:17,in a single crotch.
00:25:17,00:25:18,(laughing)
00:25:18,00:25:19,- That was that.
00:25:19,00:25:20,A YouTube video we used to watch
00:25:20,00:25:22,"in the first year of uni, I think,"
00:25:22,00:25:24,"so the birds are one crotch, yeah."
00:25:24,00:25:26,(laughing)
00:25:26,00:25:28,"But it's really good, the giraffes are great."
00:25:28,00:25:30,"They're great beds because they're off the ground,"
00:25:30,00:25:31,"meaning you're a bit safer as a bird,"
00:25:31,00:25:34,whereas buffalo lie down and they're unstable.
00:25:34,00:25:35,Giraffes stable.
00:25:35,00:25:36,"- Wait, except when a giraffe sleeps,"
00:25:36,00:25:38,because they've been seen in the wild
00:25:38,00:25:39,to be sleeping while laying down.
00:25:39,00:25:41,And what they do is they bend around
00:25:41,00:25:43,and they use their butt as a pillow.
00:25:43,00:25:45,So they bring their head right around
00:25:45,00:25:47,and rest it on the top of their butt.
00:25:47,00:25:48,- That's nice.
00:25:48,00:25:50,"- So I would say the best thing about being a giraffe,"
00:25:50,00:25:51,"actually, you can do that."
00:25:51,00:25:52,- It must be right.
00:25:52,00:25:53,"I mean, we would all kill to do that."
00:25:53,00:25:57,"But oxpeckers, they eat the little animals,"
00:25:57,00:25:59,"but they also eat the host bodily fluids,"
00:25:59,00:26:02,"including mucus, blood and snot,"
00:26:02,00:26:05,and even the goop that you get in your eyes.
00:26:05,00:26:05,- Yeah.
00:26:05,00:26:08,- They also like to live on zebras.
00:26:08,00:26:12,"And I read one article, I'll just read a bit of it."
00:26:12,00:26:14,"Still in its statue-like pose,"
00:26:14,00:26:15,the zebra raised its tail quickly
00:26:15,00:26:17,and held it out behind its body.
00:26:17,00:26:20,The oxpecker immediately scuttled down
00:26:20,00:26:22,onto the hairless black shiny skin
00:26:22,00:26:25,that surrounds the zebra's anal region
00:26:25,00:26:27,and worked this area assiduously.
00:26:27,00:26:30,- Sounds like an extract from six birds one crotch.
00:26:30,00:26:32,(laughing)
00:26:32,00:26:34,"- Ooh, I've got a fact about symbiotic"
00:26:34,00:26:36,analist relationships.
00:26:36,00:26:36,- Right.
00:26:36,00:26:39,"- So there's a kind of leech called plackob,"
00:26:39,00:26:43,"plackob deloidies, jager skeoldi,"
00:26:43,00:26:46,"which is a leech, which lives inside hippo anuses."
00:26:46,00:26:49,"It spends most of its life, in fact, inside a hippo's bottom."
00:26:49,00:26:51,And they live for about 2.6 years.
00:26:51,00:26:54,So they were covered in the new scientist in 1995
00:26:54,00:26:57,"and the headline was, ""Leech rides the tunnel of love."""
00:26:57,00:26:59,"'Cause it's safe from oxpeckers, actually."
00:26:59,00:27:02,It's safer if you go right into the bottom
00:27:02,00:27:05,and they have to swim into a hippo's bottom to have sex.
00:27:05,00:27:08,- Do they swim into it or do they just crawl into it?
00:27:08,00:27:09,- I think when the hippo is-
00:27:09,00:27:10,- Under water?
00:27:10,00:27:10,"- Under water, I swear I'm in."
00:27:10,00:27:12,But it has special tools designed
00:27:12,00:27:14,to push open a hippo's sphincter.
00:27:14,00:27:16,"- When you say tools, it's part of its body."
00:27:16,00:27:18,"- It's part of its body, yeah."
00:27:18,00:27:19,- I think it's a little shovel.
00:27:19,00:27:21,(laughing)
00:27:21,00:27:25,"- One really cool symbiotic relationship, I quite like."
00:27:25,00:27:26,Crabbs and urchins.
00:27:26,00:27:28,"- Oh yeah. - So I didn't know about this, but-"
00:27:28,00:27:31,- I hope we talk about Victorian street children here.
00:27:31,00:27:33,We're not gonna be very disappointed.
00:27:33,00:27:35,"- And Jen, it's a lice, I hope."
00:27:35,00:27:36,(laughing)
00:27:36,00:27:37,- Of course.
00:27:37,00:27:38,"- Cool, Blimey, Gavna."
00:27:38,00:27:40,So you're crab-proof-harving.
00:27:40,00:27:42,(laughing)
00:27:42,00:27:44,"- Spot scratching your crotch, Dodger."
00:27:44,00:27:47,(laughing)
00:27:47,00:27:48,"- No, it's neither of those things."
00:27:48,00:27:51,"I see urchins and it's just crabs, like normal crabs."
00:27:51,00:27:53,"And so urchins travel on the back of crabs,"
00:27:53,00:27:55,"which is useful for them, as it means they can travel."
00:27:55,00:27:57,So urchins can't really travel very well otherwise.
00:27:57,00:27:58,- See the world?
00:27:58,00:28:00,"- Exactly, get out there, take some photos."
00:28:00,00:28:01,"- On the gap, yeah."
00:28:01,00:28:02,(laughing)
00:28:02,00:28:04,"- Right, some urchin postcards, but it's good for the crab"
00:28:04,00:28:07,because they can suddenly use it as a disguise
00:28:07,00:28:08,or a weapon if they need to.
00:28:08,00:28:11,So they can sometimes get the urchin down with their claw
00:28:11,00:28:12,or face something with the urchin
00:28:12,00:28:14,and act like they've got a really awesome spiky back.
00:28:14,00:28:15,"- Yeah, wow."
00:28:15,00:28:16,"- I've got another one, just while we're on"
00:28:16,00:28:20,"the symbiotic relationship role, there's an ant,"
00:28:20,00:28:23,"which is called Campanosa Schmitze, which is a great name."
00:28:23,00:28:26,And it only lives on a single species of pitcher plant.
00:28:26,00:28:30,"You know, pitcher plants, they're the ones that consume prey"
00:28:30,00:28:32,"by, I think they fall into, they drown."
00:28:32,00:28:33,- Yeah.
00:28:33,00:28:33,- So they look like a chum.
00:28:33,00:28:34,"- Yeah, yeah."
00:28:34,00:28:35,- Oh wow.
00:28:35,00:28:38,- But the ants swim around in the digestive fluids
00:28:38,00:28:41,"of the plant, they consume the nectar of the plant"
00:28:41,00:28:44,"and they also consume some of the prey that the plant eats,"
00:28:44,00:28:46,but the plants which have ants swimming around
00:28:46,00:28:48,"in their stomachs, basically, get bigger than those"
00:28:48,00:28:51,which don't have them because the ants keep the traps clean
00:28:51,00:28:54,"and they hunt mosquito larvae, which would otherwise"
00:28:54,00:28:56,soak up more nutrients.
00:28:56,00:28:58,"So it's beneficial to, if you're a pitcher plant,"
00:28:58,00:28:59,to have ants in your stomach.
00:28:59,00:29:02,And the plants also eat the ants poo.
00:29:02,00:29:04,"- Nice, as well as eating the ants."
00:29:04,00:29:06,"- They don't eat the ants, the ants survive in there,"
00:29:06,00:29:07,the ants are tolerated within the system.
00:29:07,00:29:09,"- Yeah, you get some pitcher plants, don't you,"
00:29:09,00:29:11,"where you get little shrews who sit on the,"
00:29:11,00:29:13,on the side of them and then poo into them
00:29:13,00:29:15,just like little toilets.
00:29:15,00:29:18,"Yeah, and they eat the nitrogen of those."
00:29:18,00:29:19,"- What's the benefit for the shrew,"
00:29:19,00:29:20,'cause they don't mind where they poo.
00:29:20,00:29:23,"- Just gets a toilet, you know, for dinner."
00:29:23,00:29:23,- Is that enjoyable?
00:29:23,00:29:24,'Cause they--
00:29:24,00:29:26,"- Yeah, yes, 'cause it can sit there reading its iPhone."
00:29:26,00:29:27,"- Okay, that makes sense."
00:29:27,00:29:29,"- It's beneficial, you wouldn't like it"
00:29:29,00:29:32,"if we took away your toilet from you, Dan."
00:29:32,00:29:34,"But if the concept of toilets didn't exist for us,"
00:29:34,00:29:36,I would just poo here right now.
00:29:36,00:29:37,"- They've now got the concept of toilets,"
00:29:37,00:29:38,so they have to go as a pitcher plant.
00:29:38,00:29:40,"- They don't, I mean, Dan's also very sick of question here."
00:29:40,00:29:41,What is going on?
00:29:41,00:29:43,- No animal understands the importance
00:29:43,00:29:46,of a good sewerage system except humans.
00:29:46,00:29:49,One earth is a shrew clamping up at the top of the flower
00:29:49,00:29:52,in order to take a shit where I was just doing it all around.
00:29:52,00:29:55,"- I think what happens is it eats something from the flower,"
00:29:55,00:29:57,"maybe some nectar or something,"
00:29:57,00:30:01,"and that is a laxative, and then that makes it poo."
00:30:01,00:30:02,I believe that's true.
00:30:02,00:30:03,- So it almost can't get out in time.
00:30:03,00:30:05,"It's kind of like a zine or something,"
00:30:05,00:30:06,and it sort of has to poo in the shower.
00:30:06,00:30:07,"- It's like a delicious restaurant,"
00:30:07,00:30:09,but with very bad hygiene standards.
00:30:09,00:30:13,But then they use your poo to power the electricity.
00:30:13,00:30:14,"- Oh, wow."
00:30:14,00:30:15,- Where is this restaurant?
00:30:15,00:30:18,- I feel a start-up coming on.
00:30:18,00:30:22,"- Hey, I've got something on armpits."
00:30:22,00:30:24,"In the 19th century in Austria,"
00:30:24,00:30:27,"there used to be the thing where, at Dancers,"
00:30:27,00:30:30,women would carry underneath their armpits
00:30:30,00:30:32,"a single slice of apple,"
00:30:32,00:30:34,"and they would hold it there all night long,"
00:30:34,00:30:36,"and the idea was at the end of the night,"
00:30:36,00:30:38,the girl would approach someone who they'd fancy
00:30:38,00:30:41,to guy if it was a guy that they fancy.
00:30:41,00:30:42,"They would go up and they would take the apple out,"
00:30:42,00:30:43,and they would present the apple.
00:30:43,00:30:45,"- They still do that on Love Island, I think, do they?"
00:30:45,00:30:47,(all laughing)
00:30:47,00:30:48,- I think I'm sure.
00:30:48,00:30:50,"- So it was sent to the guy, and if the guy eats it,"
00:30:50,00:30:52,"he's saying, ""I'm keen."""
00:30:52,00:30:53,- Yeah.
00:30:53,00:30:54,- Wow.
00:30:54,00:30:55,"And is there any way for him to say,"
00:30:55,00:30:57,"""I'm keen without eating the armpit."""
00:30:57,00:31:00,- But I think if you're not willing to eat the apple
00:31:00,00:31:02,"that's been inside the armpit of your loved one,"
00:31:02,00:31:03,you don't love her at all.
00:31:03,00:31:04,- You're not keen enough.
00:31:04,00:31:07,"So women's armpits smell of onion,"
00:31:07,00:31:09,"and men's smell of cheese, apparently."
00:31:09,00:31:09,And this is--
00:31:09,00:31:12,"- Well, between us, we can have a delicious bag of crisps."
00:31:12,00:31:14,(all laughing)
00:31:14,00:31:16,- You know those like salt and shake crisps
00:31:16,00:31:18,"that you used to get where they don't taste of anything,"
00:31:18,00:31:19,but you have to put your own--
00:31:19,00:31:20,"- Yeah, absolutely."
00:31:20,00:31:23,- Are you proposing that you scissors someone else's armpit
00:31:23,00:31:24,"with one crisp in the middle,"
00:31:24,00:31:25,and you're gonna lovely cheese and onion--
00:31:25,00:31:27,- I'm gonna go to an Austrian dance.
00:31:27,00:31:29,(all laughing)
00:31:29,00:31:31,- I think it doesn't cost any more just to buy cheese
00:31:31,00:31:33,and onion rather than just buying cheese
00:31:33,00:31:35,and then wiping it up against a woman's armpit.
00:31:35,00:31:36,- That's true.
00:31:36,00:31:37,- I don't see why you would.
00:31:37,00:31:39,"- Those crisps, they used to be the same price"
00:31:39,00:31:40,"as ready salted crisps,"
00:31:40,00:31:42,but you still had to put extra work in.
00:31:42,00:31:43,- That's so weird.
00:31:43,00:31:44,- It was fun.
00:31:44,00:31:45,"- Yeah, it was fun."
00:31:45,00:31:46,"- But this is about compounds in their armpits,"
00:31:46,00:31:48,"by the way, this isn't just people sniffing them"
00:31:48,00:31:49,"and saying, ""Oh, that's oniony."""
00:31:49,00:31:50,- Okay.
00:31:50,00:31:53,- This is the compound that women's armpits generate
00:31:53,00:31:55,"is something called as a thio alcohol,"
00:31:55,00:31:57,"which when it combines with a bacteria smells like onion,"
00:31:57,00:31:58,and then men's sweat has--
00:31:58,00:32:00,- Would you say alcohol?
00:32:00,00:32:03,"- Yeah, but don't go licking women's armpits for that."
00:32:03,00:32:05,"Again, it's not worth it, I'll buy you a beer."
00:32:05,00:32:07,(laughing)
00:32:07,00:32:09,(upbeat music)
00:32:09,00:32:14,"- Okay, that's it, that is all of our facts."
