00:00:14,00:00:20,"Hello, and welcome to another episode of No Such Thing as a Fish, a weekly podcast coming"
00:00:20,00:00:24,to you from four undisclosed locations in the UK.
00:00:24,00:00:28,"My name is Dan Schreiber, I am sitting here with Anna Tyshinski, Andrew Hunter Murray,"
00:00:28,00:00:32,"and James Harkin, and once again, we have gathered round the microphones with our four"
00:00:32,00:00:38,"favourite facts from the last seven days, and in no particular order, here we go."
00:00:38,00:00:41,"Starting with fact number one, and that is James."
00:00:41,00:00:48,"Okay, my fact this week is that some dog owners in Alaska are putting spiky jackets on their"
00:00:48,00:00:54,pets to stop bald eagles from carrying them away.
00:00:54,00:00:58,How many pets in Alaska have been carried off by bald eagles?
00:00:58,00:01:03,"To my knowledge, in recent weeks, zero, but that just shows that these jackets are doing"
00:01:03,00:01:04,"their job, right?"
00:01:04,00:01:06,"That's a good point, yeah."
00:01:06,00:01:09,"It's so cool, have you guys seen a picture of it?"
00:01:09,00:01:16,"They look like futuristic ravers, like an apocalyptic punk, it's amazing, it's like huge glow sticks"
00:01:16,00:01:21,on the back with their spikes multi-coloured and so on.
00:01:21,00:01:24,"Because I read a few things saying, I can't look out whether the guys selling this stuff"
00:01:24,00:01:29,"are just on a genius streak of manipulating dog owners paranoia, because there are lots"
00:01:29,00:01:32,of eagles and they do carry off very heavy fish.
00:01:32,00:01:38,"Well, okay, so there are a lot more bald eagles recently than there have been over the recent"
00:01:38,00:01:40,"history, that is for sure."
00:01:40,00:01:49,"There were about 72,000 in the US in 2009 and in 2019 there were 316,000 and that's to say"
00:01:49,00:01:52,"nothing of the ones that are in Canada, which is plenty as well."
00:01:52,00:01:58,"So that's good news for eagles, but it might be bad news for dogs because there are anecdotal"
00:01:58,00:02:03,stories of eagles coming down and picking up dogs and so they come up with these new
00:02:03,00:02:04,products.
00:02:04,00:02:11,"There's a company, they've got a website called coyotevest.com and they've taken their existing"
00:02:11,00:02:16,"waistcoats that they sell to dog owners and they've put, like Dan says, these kind of"
00:02:16,00:02:21,"almost like kaplunk sticks, if you can imagine what they look like on the back of them and"
00:02:21,00:02:26,then there's another product called hawk shield which has velcro on it so that when the hawk
00:02:26,00:02:31,"or the eagle comes down, it only picks up the vest and it doesn't pick up the dog a"
00:02:31,00:02:36,"bit like, you know, if you have a lizard and someone tries to catch the lizard but it loses"
00:02:36,00:02:37,its tail.
00:02:37,00:02:38,Yeah.
00:02:38,00:02:41,"It's weak velcro then, because that sounds like it's going to come undone all the time."
00:02:41,00:02:43,That sounds really annoying.
00:02:43,00:02:48,"I thought you were going to say that the eagle sticks to the velcro when it lands, that you"
00:02:48,00:02:50,get the velcro that just glues it to the dog.
00:02:50,00:02:54,When your dog comes back and it's just got 20 eagles attached to it.
00:02:54,00:02:57,"Guys, it doesn't matter what they can do, they're not doing it."
00:02:57,00:02:58,What?
00:02:58,00:03:02,Why is everyone speculating about how they're not blimmin' doing it?
00:03:02,00:03:07,"One tiny little Pomeranian was sadly killed by one in 2020, not even carried off, just"
00:03:07,00:03:08,killed.
00:03:08,00:03:10,One too many Anna.
00:03:10,00:03:11,What?
00:03:11,00:03:13,It's not worth the huge industry.
00:03:13,00:03:19,"The only other evidence I could find of any pet attacks was in 2008, a guy called David"
00:03:19,00:03:24,Hunsaker in Alaska said he had a bald eagle nest outside his house in his garden and at
00:03:24,00:03:29,"one point he found a cat collar in there, which implies, I suppose, that the eagles"
00:03:29,00:03:31,eaten the cat and left the collar.
00:03:31,00:03:32,Okay.
00:03:32,00:03:37,How do you explain the fact that two weeks ago I met a man who was taken by an eagle when
00:03:37,00:03:38,he was a child?
00:03:38,00:03:42,"Do you really want to know how he explained that, Dan?"
00:03:42,00:03:43,It's true.
00:03:43,00:03:48,"I met a guy who came, a builder who came to our house, he's from Kazakhstan and he told"
00:03:48,00:03:52,my wife that when he was a child he was in a field and the eagle picked him up and carried
00:03:52,00:03:57,"him away and his mother had to run after it and beat it with a stick so he could be dropped,"
00:03:57,00:03:58,which it did.
00:03:58,00:03:59,How do you explain that?
00:03:59,00:04:03,Did he use that as the reason why he left halfway through the day and didn't come back?
00:04:03,00:04:05,"Sorry, another bloody eagle."
00:04:05,00:04:09,"I'm not questioning his veracity but I, when I worked in the Scottish Parliament, used"
00:04:09,00:04:13,to have a couple of constituents who were incessantly complaining their sheep were being
00:04:13,00:04:20,"carried off by sea eagles and I would lump them in the same box as your Kazakhstani builder,"
00:04:20,00:04:24,which is a box of people who have hallucinations of eagles carrying things away.
00:04:24,00:04:29,"Listen, there was a story in Scotland in 2019 and this might be the one that you're talking"
00:04:29,00:04:33,"about Anna, where sea eagles were blamed for stealing lambs and this farmers, they took"
00:04:33,00:04:37,it really seriously and they were trying to work out how to prevent it.
00:04:37,00:04:41,"They were putting up helium balloons to sort of float above where the sheep were, the lamb"
00:04:41,00:04:43,"were, to sort of scare them away."
00:04:43,00:04:47,Just make it look like a birthday party for the eagles when they're tucking into their
00:04:47,00:04:48,lovely fresh lambs.
00:04:48,00:04:49,That's true.
00:04:49,00:04:50,It didn't work out though.
00:04:50,00:04:53,They said we're struggling a bit with these because they're not staying in the air.
00:04:53,00:04:55,So a bit of a flaw with the old balloon technology there.
00:04:55,00:05:00,All that amazes me about that is that I guarantee you it's going to be the same farmer I used
00:05:00,00:05:06,"to talk to in time, is that he's still banging away at the same nonsense drum 14 years later."
00:05:06,00:05:07,Wow.
00:05:07,00:05:11,"Maybe if you've done something 14 years ago Anna, we wouldn't still have this problem."
00:05:11,00:05:15,"It's actually why I'm not still in the job, they find me."
00:05:15,00:05:18,"They've got very bad branding, bald eagles."
00:05:18,00:05:20,I feel so sorry for them.
00:05:20,00:05:22,Why are they called bald?
00:05:22,00:05:26,Bald is not what you want to be as an eagle and indeed they're not bald.
00:05:26,00:05:27,"And I actually, I never really thought about it."
00:05:27,00:05:31,"I always thought maybe bald eagles were hiding a bald patch that I just had never spotted,"
00:05:31,00:05:35,"but it just comes from an old English word for white, like shining white."
00:05:35,00:05:38,"Oh, it's going to have white heads today."
00:05:38,00:05:44,"I always thought it was because the white head made them look bald, but it's not."
00:05:44,00:05:48,"That makes sense, but I guess bald will come from the same word, I guess, like clean white."
00:05:48,00:05:49,Yeah.
00:05:49,00:05:53,"I think pie bald, a horse that's pie bald is two different colors, and I think the"
00:05:53,00:05:56,bald bit of that means white headed.
00:05:56,00:06:01,"So in the USA, it is also very illegal to own an eagle."
00:06:01,00:06:02,You can remember it because it rhymes.
00:06:02,00:06:03,It's very handy.
00:06:03,00:06:06,"Is it illegal to own a beagle though, Andy?"
00:06:06,00:06:07,No.
00:06:07,00:06:11,So how are you supposed to remember it?
00:06:11,00:06:17,"A bald eagle, the national bird of America, you're not allowed to own at all."
00:06:17,00:06:21,"And if you find a dead one, you're not allowed to keep it."
00:06:21,00:06:22,Why would you want to?
00:06:22,00:06:29,"But there is a US facility called the National Eagle Repository, which effectively is a massive"
00:06:29,00:06:35,"fridge full of dead eagles and eagle body parts, because they're used by indigenous Americans"
00:06:35,00:06:38,for religious purposes and ceremonies.
00:06:38,00:06:45,So this National Eagle Repository receives 30 to 40 eagle carcasses every single day
00:06:45,00:06:47,they're coming in the door.
00:06:47,00:06:48,Yeah.
00:06:48,00:06:49,And it's in a suburb of Denver.
00:06:49,00:06:52,"I mean, it's nowhere very glamorous or weird, it's just in Denver."
00:06:52,00:06:56,"You wouldn't put it, you know, in Manhattan, which I don't think you'd be putting there."
00:06:56,00:06:57,"No, right."
00:06:57,00:06:58,Or Broadway.
00:06:58,00:07:01,And the rental cost would be too high for your enormous eagle fridge.
00:07:01,00:07:06,"But yeah, so you can't, when you say no one can, you can own an eagle if you belong to"
00:07:06,00:07:11,"one of the, I think it's like 573 recognized tribes who use those eagles in their ceremonies."
00:07:11,00:07:12,Exactly.
00:07:12,00:07:17,"You can apply either for a full eagle or for effectively a franken eagle, you can apply"
00:07:17,00:07:21,to get the constituent parts of an eagle if they have an eagle which has an eye missing
00:07:21,00:07:23,or a wing missing or a tail or whatever.
00:07:23,00:07:27,"Well, they'll give you an eye from a different eagle and stick it into your eagle, will they?"
00:07:27,00:07:31,"And I think they will, they will send you an eagle kit."
00:07:31,00:07:32,What?
00:07:32,00:07:35,"It's not, it's not build your own eagle."
00:07:35,00:07:41,"No, no, no, it's things like burning the feathers during ceremonies, yeah, it's, it is for proper"
00:07:41,00:07:42,rituals.
00:07:42,00:07:43,Yeah.
00:07:43,00:07:46,"But if you find an eagle, you're encouraged to post it, you're literally encouraged to"
00:07:46,00:07:48,go to the post office and send it to them.
00:07:48,00:07:50,This is just as a random person.
00:07:50,00:07:54,"And there's instructions on their website where they say, you know, if you're going"
00:07:54,00:07:58,"to do it, select a very sturdy cardboard box."
00:07:58,00:08:03,"Don't pack too many eagles in, you know, don't bend them and make them a bit out of shape."
00:08:03,00:08:06,You've got to send them in a frozen state.
00:08:06,00:08:09,And I'm not sure how you do that because they say don't include gel or ice packs.
00:08:09,00:08:14,"But if you send them inside a ice cooler, they will send that back to you."
00:08:14,00:08:18,"So it's sort of like, don't worry, you will get your ice cooler back."
00:08:18,00:08:19,You've got to double bag them.
00:08:19,00:08:23,"You know, there's all these rules and you've got to, you've got to ship them via FedEx"
00:08:23,00:08:26,"on any non-holidays that are Monday, Tuesdays or Wednesdays."
00:08:26,00:08:31,A paw in turn who's opening the post in that place every single day.
00:08:31,00:08:32,Just one is it.
00:08:32,00:08:35,"Oh, it's another rotten, maggoty eagle."
00:08:35,00:08:41,"Have you guys heard of wounded in winter beautiful bald eagle, speaking of Native Americans?"
00:08:41,00:08:42,No.
00:08:42,00:08:43,Is that a person?
00:08:43,00:08:44,Or is that a...
00:08:44,00:08:45,It's a person.
00:08:45,00:08:48,His name is also David Bald Eagle for short.
00:08:48,00:08:49,Nice.
00:08:49,00:08:54,"So if you're called David, then it does seem like you can use the words wounded in winter"
00:08:54,00:08:56,beautiful instead of David.
00:08:56,00:08:59,But David Bald Eagle was an actor.
00:08:59,00:09:03,He was in dances with wolves as well as a lot of other things.
00:09:03,00:09:05,But he had an amazing life.
00:09:05,00:09:07,He was in the Second World War.
00:09:07,00:09:13,He was dropped into Italy and it's a group of soldiers who fought so fiercely.
00:09:13,00:09:17,The Germans called them the devils in baggy pants.
00:09:17,00:09:21,"And then after fighting there, they took him out again and he was dropped over Normandy"
00:09:21,00:09:23,during the Normandy landings.
00:09:23,00:09:28,"But he was accidentally dropped in the wrong place directly over German troops, which meant"
00:09:28,00:09:33,they could literally just look up and shoot at these guys who were landing on them.
00:09:33,00:09:36,He said that we were like clay pigeons coming down.
00:09:36,00:09:38,Most of my outfit was wiped out.
00:09:38,00:09:40,He said as he came down.
00:09:40,00:09:44,So ironic that the bald eagle ended up being like a clay pigeon.
00:09:44,00:09:46,"Yes, exactly."
00:09:46,00:09:47,The medics came.
00:09:47,00:09:48,They left him for dead.
00:09:48,00:09:51,"But then some British soldiers, commandos, came in afterwards and realised that he was"
00:09:51,00:09:53,still alive and managed to save his life.
00:09:53,00:09:59,"And then he later became a competitive ballroom dancer, a pro baseball player."
00:09:59,00:10:03,And then he became an actor and also danced with Marilyn Monroe.
00:10:03,00:10:04,Imagine that for a life.
00:10:04,00:10:05,Wow.
00:10:05,00:10:06,That was an extraordinary CV.
00:10:06,00:10:12,"It actually, it's hard to know what job to apply for with that kind of image."
00:10:12,00:10:15,You know the bird we started talking about here.
00:10:15,00:10:16,What kind of eagle is that?
00:10:16,00:10:17,"Oh, the bald eagle."
00:10:17,00:10:18,The American bald eagle.
00:10:18,00:10:24,They really interestingly sound nothing like we have all been conditioned to think they
00:10:24,00:10:25,sound.
00:10:25,00:10:32,So if you picture the American desert and someone riding a horse through a canyon and he looks
00:10:32,00:10:36,"up and there's an eagle above and it makes this amazing 'ya' cry, right?"
00:10:36,00:10:37,That was a very bad impression of it.
00:10:37,00:10:38,Try a better one.
00:10:38,00:10:39,Try a better one.
00:10:39,00:10:40,Yeah.
00:10:40,00:10:41,That one.
00:10:41,00:10:42,That was really good.
00:10:42,00:10:43,Not to make it as bit flimmy.
00:10:43,00:10:44,Bit well.
00:10:44,00:10:46,"Okay, look."
00:10:46,00:10:50,"Anyway, they don't sound like that at all."
00:10:50,00:10:54,They make these pathetic little cheaps and they have to get the sound of a red tailed
00:10:54,00:10:59,hawk dubbed over in movies to make everyone think that they sound magnificent and mighty.
00:10:59,00:11:00,They don't at all.
00:11:00,00:11:03,"Well, they used to get the sound of a red tailed hawk, but now I imagine you'll be employed"
00:11:03,00:11:06,for the job.
00:11:06,00:11:12,"Okay, so do you know how bald eagles have sex when you got to that part of the podcast"
00:11:12,00:11:13,already?
00:11:13,00:11:16,It took longer than I expected.
00:11:16,00:11:17,Is it mid-flight?
00:11:17,00:11:23,"Yeah, certainly the courting is all mid-flight and that's kind of the interesting part of"
00:11:23,00:11:24,it.
00:11:24,00:11:27,"So you'll get two bald eagles, a male and a female, and they'll fly really, really high"
00:11:27,00:11:33,up together and then they'll lock their talons together and they'll go into kind of a cartwheel
00:11:33,00:11:34,death spin.
00:11:34,00:11:41,If you imagine like a helicopter where the blades have all gone crazy and all the drivers
00:11:41,00:11:46,"stopped being able to control it and it goes into a spin, they come right down to the floor"
00:11:46,00:11:51,"and they break it apart at the last minute and that is kind of the courting technique,"
00:11:51,00:11:54,although sometimes it has to be said they do actually hit the ground.
00:11:54,00:11:55,Oh.
00:11:55,00:11:58,"Well, that's what makes it sexy, the risk."
00:11:58,00:11:59,It's the risk.
00:11:59,00:12:02,"It's like a fistywank, isn't it?"
00:12:02,00:12:03,It's a sort of...
00:12:03,00:12:04,A fistywank.
00:12:04,00:12:07,That's not what you want to say.
00:12:07,00:12:08,That's not a fisty.
00:12:08,00:12:09,That's not what you want to say.
00:12:09,00:12:10,There's our title for this week's episode.
00:12:10,00:12:11,No such thing as a fistywank.
00:12:11,00:12:15,I think you might be grappling for a spikywank.
00:12:15,00:12:18,"A fistywank is just a normal wank, isn't it?"
00:12:18,00:12:23,"There was a lot of grappling going on, that's for sure."
00:12:23,00:12:24,But is it in the danger?
00:12:24,00:12:28,"Is that the idea that as they're tumbling down, they're like, we've got three seconds"
00:12:28,00:12:29,"to live, quick."
00:12:29,00:12:33,"I think if you were to anthropomorphise these eagles, then that's what you would think,"
00:12:33,00:12:34,for sure.
00:12:34,00:12:38,"It's like, you know, if you can afford to do such a dangerous thing, then it might mean"
00:12:38,00:12:39,you're a good mate.
00:12:39,00:12:43,"God, I can't wait to hear the David Attenborough commentary on this."
00:12:43,00:12:46,"And so, like on a fistywank."
00:12:46,00:12:56,"OK, it is time for fact number two, and that is Anna."
00:12:56,00:13:02,My fact is that the last emperor of the Shang dynasty built a wine lake and a meat forest
00:13:02,00:13:04,for himself.
00:13:04,00:13:12,"Wow, that is, and what, so he had all loads of wine and meat whenever he needed it, I"
00:13:12,00:13:13,guess?
00:13:13,00:13:17,"I think basically, yeah, just a meat forest sounds so disgusting, doesn't it?"
00:13:17,00:13:20,"But yeah, this was a very long time ago."
00:13:20,00:13:23,"This was over 3,000 years ago."
00:13:23,00:13:29,"It was the emperor D. Shin, and he was known for being very sort of decadent and prone"
00:13:29,00:13:31,to a bit of excess.
00:13:31,00:13:36,"And yeah, he filled a lake on his, oh, I think he dug a lake, in fact, filled it with wine."
00:13:36,00:13:41,And then he hung cured meat from the trees all around it.
00:13:41,00:13:46,"And according to the sources of the dynasty that came immediately after him, he got his"
00:13:46,00:13:49,courtiers to chase each other through this forest naked.
00:13:49,00:13:50,Wow.
00:13:50,00:13:51,Interesting.
00:13:51,00:13:57,"So, if it came from the people who came after him, might it have been a bit of kind of propaganda"
00:13:57,00:13:59,"against him, do you think, or not?"
00:13:59,00:14:02,"It's almost, I mean, I guess it's impossible to say."
00:14:02,00:14:06,"He was definitely pretty debauched, and the reason he was removed from power, the reason"
00:14:06,00:14:11,"he eventually lost the entire dynasty, which had gone on for about 600 years, is because"
00:14:11,00:14:14,"he was corrupt and, you know, excessive and stuff."
00:14:14,00:14:17,"But yeah, what's a weird coincidence, and which does imply that could be the case, is"
00:14:17,00:14:24,that the dynasty that preceded him also fell down because the last emperor built a lake
00:14:24,00:14:25,of wine.
00:14:25,00:14:28,I think the M.O.G. is not so weird.
00:14:28,00:14:32,"Surely, one of his advisors should have said, ""Wait, this didn't work last time."""
00:14:32,00:14:35,"Look, this time it will work."
00:14:35,00:14:38,It's completely different.
00:14:38,00:14:42,Both persuaded to do it by their concubines.
00:14:42,00:14:46,"There's always in this history, there's always some terrible woman forcing them to do it"
00:14:46,00:14:47,backstage.
00:14:47,00:14:48,Yeah.
00:14:48,00:14:49,"How big was this lake, Anna?"
00:14:49,00:14:53,"Are we talking a genuine lake, or is it a sort of swimming pool called a lake?"
00:14:53,00:14:54,It's not Loch Ness.
00:14:54,00:14:58,"It's not Loch Ness, but they, astonishingly, and this must have been the most exciting"
00:14:58,00:15:02,"moment in this archeologist's life, they found a pond that matches up to it."
00:15:02,00:15:03,This is in 1999.
00:15:03,00:15:07,"So this is the first dynasty of which we have actual archeological evidence, so it's not"
00:15:07,00:15:09,just written stories about it.
00:15:09,00:15:13,"We've got, like, archeology that matches up, and in 1999, they found an artificial pond"
00:15:13,00:15:17,"in Yanxi, and it's 130 metres long and 20 metres wide."
00:15:17,00:15:21,So it's much bigger than your biggest swimming pool.
00:15:21,00:15:23,"Largely full of water, I imagine, these days."
00:15:23,00:15:24,No wine left.
00:15:24,00:15:25,No.
00:15:25,00:15:26,I don't think.
00:15:26,00:15:27,Very diluted by this point.
00:15:27,00:15:28,Wow.
00:15:28,00:15:29,Right.
00:15:29,00:15:30,"Yeah, because it's really interesting."
00:15:30,00:15:38,"These Shang Dynasty, we did think that perhaps it was like a kind of a story or some thing"
00:15:38,00:15:42,"that wasn't actual history, but then, like you say, they did find, I think they found some"
00:15:42,00:15:45,bones or something with things written on them or…
00:15:45,00:15:51,"Yeah, they were called dragon bones, and the idea of dragon bones were you would use these"
00:15:51,00:15:52,for telling the future.
00:15:52,00:15:58,"So they would write on them, and they would then put them in a fire and crack them."
00:15:58,00:16:02,"And the bones themselves would be bones from an ox's shoulder, or they would be the flat"
00:16:02,00:16:04,side of a tortoise shell.
00:16:04,00:16:08,"And once they cracked, wherever the lines went, that is how you told the future."
00:16:08,00:16:10,You followed the crack lines.
00:16:10,00:16:15,"And for years, we thought that the Shang Dynasty was completely mythological, as with the"
00:16:15,00:16:16,preceding dynasty.
00:16:16,00:16:20,There was not really any evidence except sort of anecdotal evidence.
00:16:20,00:16:27,"And then in the late 1800s, all of these little, supposed dragon bones were being sold by pharmacies"
00:16:27,00:16:30,in China because they were seen to be a cure for malaria.
00:16:30,00:16:34,"There was a guy called Dr. Wang Yerong, who was the director of Imperial College, who"
00:16:34,00:16:38,"had malaria, and was prescribed some of these dragon bones."
00:16:38,00:16:42,"And he was looking at them going, ""Hang on a second, this looks like really old writing."""
00:16:42,00:16:47,"And that's where they realised this was the original writing of the Shang Dynasty, and"
00:16:47,00:16:48,it was real.
00:16:48,00:16:52,Do we trust a guy who thinks that these ox bones cure malaria?
00:16:52,00:16:53,Yeah.
00:16:53,00:16:56,How's he making it to Imperial College like that?
00:16:56,00:16:57,What year was that?
00:16:57,00:17:01,"This is 1899, and this is the Imperial College of China."
00:17:01,00:17:02,And yeah.
00:17:02,00:17:03,"Oh, sorry."
00:17:03,00:17:04,Fair enough.
00:17:04,00:17:05,"Well, back."
00:17:05,00:17:08,"So malaria not cured, but you have made an unbelievable archaeological discovery."
00:17:08,00:17:09,Exactly.
00:17:09,00:17:10,Swings around about.
00:17:10,00:17:11,Very cool.
00:17:11,00:17:14,"They seem, they're kind of like Ouija boards, aren't they?"
00:17:14,00:17:18,"But sort of much harder to read, because I suppose I was looking at the process that"
00:17:18,00:17:22,"you go through when you're interpreting oracle bones, which is what they're also called."
00:17:22,00:17:26,"And there's an example of one king, for instance, who had a toothache."
00:17:26,00:17:32,"And what you do is you list a bunch of options for the bone, and then you ask it, you know,"
00:17:32,00:17:36,"which of these options do you pick, and whichever direction the crack goes in, refers to the"
00:17:36,00:17:37,option.
00:17:37,00:17:39,"So this king was like, I've got a toothache."
00:17:39,00:17:43,"So first of all, which of my bastard ancestors is causing it?"
00:17:43,00:17:45,And he lists four ancestors.
00:17:45,00:17:48,"And then you've got to burn a bone, and the crack goes to the right, and they're like,"
00:17:48,00:17:51,"okay, it's, you know, it's Bob, Uncle Bob, who's caused it."
00:17:51,00:17:54,"And then he's like, okay, which animal should I kill to appease Uncle Bob?"
00:17:54,00:17:55,Should it be a puppy?
00:17:55,00:17:56,Should it be a pony?
00:17:56,00:17:58,Should it be a bald eagle?
00:17:58,00:17:59,And then you ask it again.
00:17:59,00:18:02,"It's quite a laborious way of having a conversation, I guess."
00:18:02,00:18:06,"I think it's quite important with these things that they are very difficult to read, because"
00:18:06,00:18:08,you are making it all up.
00:18:08,00:18:13,"And so if you're, if it's something that someone else can check your work, then that's not"
00:18:13,00:18:14,"going to work out, is it?"
00:18:14,00:18:16,It has to be something that you could say this is right.
00:18:16,00:18:19,"And when anyone says, are you sure, you're like, yeah, look where the crack goes."
00:18:19,00:18:21,"It's obvious, isn't it?"
00:18:21,00:18:23,"Look, all I'm saying is the toothache was cured."
00:18:23,00:18:26,So I'm in the fight of the oracle bones.
00:18:26,00:18:27,Wow.
00:18:27,00:18:28,It was Uncle Bob all along.
00:18:28,00:18:29,There we go.
00:18:29,00:18:33,"Uncle Bob is still stealing a child, a no-go zone for you."
00:18:33,00:18:35,"The thing you said about puppies is unfortunately true, isn't it?"
00:18:35,00:18:39,Because there were lots of shang sacrificial puppies which had been found.
00:18:39,00:18:41,And they're normally attached to people's graves.
00:18:41,00:18:46,So it was a bonus cavity that would be attached to your grave.
00:18:46,00:18:49,"And it's mostly middle-class people who did it, we think."
00:18:49,00:18:52,And there is a kind of scale range in terms of what you could afford.
00:18:52,00:18:55,"So if you couldn't afford a full dog to be sacrificed for your grave, you'd get a puppy"
00:18:55,00:18:58,"instead, simply because it was a bit smaller."
00:18:58,00:18:59,Wow.
00:18:59,00:19:00,"Ah, okay."
00:19:00,00:19:08,Do you know another reason why Emperor D. Shin was destroyed and why his empire fell?
00:19:08,00:19:09,Oh.
00:19:09,00:19:14,What a bad question to ask and what a bad way of phrasing it.
00:19:14,00:19:20,Did he have a home made of trifle to go through the wheat forest?
00:19:20,00:19:21,That's it.
00:19:21,00:19:24,"No, it was to do again with the religion."
00:19:24,00:19:27,"And again, this is written by a later dynasty, so it might all be propaganda."
00:19:27,00:19:35,"But the idea is that his people ate the animal victims which were intended for the spirits,"
00:19:35,00:19:38,probably because they might have had a bit too much to drink.
00:19:38,00:19:40,And so they just got a bit hungry.
00:19:40,00:19:44,"They looked at the sacrificial animals and they thought, ""Oh, we are meant to give those"
00:19:44,00:19:45,"to the spirits."""
00:19:45,00:19:48,"That looks like a tasty little puppy, doesn't it?"
00:19:48,00:19:50,And the spirits never take them.
00:19:50,00:19:52,"I mean, we always wake up in the morning and they're still bloody there."
00:19:52,00:19:54,"The spirits never eat them, do they?"
00:19:54,00:19:58,"I know, it's so relatable just getting a bit peckish after a few drinks and thinking,"
00:19:58,00:20:04,"""I can replace it with another puppy in the morning, can't I?"""
00:20:04,00:20:09,"He was so reviled after, actually in his reign and then immediately after it, that he is"
00:20:09,00:20:12,now known as the Emperor Zhou.
00:20:12,00:20:17,"And I've probably mispronounced that, it's about Z-H-O-U, but it's pronounced like Zhou."
00:20:17,00:20:21,And the reason he's called that is because that is the word for the bit of a horse's
00:20:21,00:20:26,saddle that would tie around the horse's tail to stop the saddle from sliding forward.
00:20:26,00:20:30,"And that's the bit that when the horse does a poo, it gets covered in poo."
00:20:30,00:20:34,So he's gone down in history as bit of a saddle most likely to get covered in shit.
00:20:34,00:20:35,That is weird.
00:20:35,00:20:39,I thought the next dynasty that came was also the Zhou dynasty.
00:20:39,00:20:40,It was.
00:20:40,00:20:41,It was extremely confusing.
00:20:41,00:20:42,Yeah.
00:20:42,00:20:45,"But they didn't call themselves after the shitty covered horse thing, surely?"
00:20:45,00:20:51,It's a slightly different word that to me sounds almost indistinguishable to Dan slightly
00:20:51,00:20:52,more adapted.
00:20:52,00:20:57,"Mandarin is probably sounds different, but one sounds like Zhou and one sounds like Zhou."
00:20:57,00:20:58,"Oh, OK."
00:20:58,00:20:59,"Oh, see."
00:20:59,00:21:06,"Can I just quickly ask just back to the very first fact, where did they get the wine from"
00:21:06,00:21:07,to fill a lake?
00:21:07,00:21:09,That's a lot of wine.
00:21:09,00:21:14,Was it a bit of a faked botched job where it was mostly water and then there was just
00:21:14,00:21:16,a top layer of wine kind of thing?
00:21:16,00:21:18,"I mean, it's not like oil and water."
00:21:18,00:21:22,People don't say they like wine and water because wine and water do mix.
00:21:22,00:21:24,You can't just keep it on the top layer.
00:21:24,00:21:29,Was it just like a normal lake and Jesus walked past?
00:21:29,00:21:33,"Every time Jesus walks past your taps, oh, god damn it, I can't do the washing up anymore."
00:21:33,00:21:34,Jesus Christ.
00:21:34,00:21:35,"Oh, yes."
00:21:35,00:21:36,That's my name.
00:21:36,00:21:37,It's a good question.
00:21:37,00:21:41,"And I don't think it was the wine as we know it was some kind of alcohol, which is usually"
00:21:41,00:21:43,referred to as wine these days.
00:21:43,00:21:44,Maybe more like beer.
00:21:44,00:21:49,"But I always wonder this as well, when in English historical sources, medieval times,"
00:21:49,00:21:53,"they talk about fountains flowing with wine and, you know, kings went through a phase of"
00:21:53,00:21:58,"about 500 years of whenever they were celebrating anything, they had a birthday or a foreign"
00:21:58,00:22:02,"dignitary came to visit, the pipes would flow with wine."
00:22:02,00:22:05,"And no one knows how they did it, but it's in all these sources."
00:22:05,00:22:11,I think it started in the 1200s with Edward Longshanks and there was a royal visit and
00:22:11,00:22:14,"it was like, you know, London flowed with wine."
00:22:14,00:22:16,I've got no idea how they made that happen.
00:22:16,00:22:17,What's going on?
00:22:17,00:22:21,"There is, there's, we might have said this before, but there is a wine kind of tap, isn't"
00:22:21,00:22:23,"there somewhere in Italy, I think."
00:22:23,00:22:27,There's like some pipes of wine where you can just go and fill up your bucket wherever
00:22:27,00:22:28,you want.
00:22:28,00:22:29,"Yes, that's right."
00:22:29,00:22:30,Or glass.
00:22:30,00:22:31,"Yes, there is."
00:22:31,00:22:32,That's very cool.
00:22:32,00:22:35,"Although, yeah, I was reading some TripAdvisor reviews of that and they did say there's"
00:22:35,00:22:39,"a sign outside it saying, ""Lauts and drunkards not welcome."""
00:22:39,00:22:40,Right.
00:22:40,00:22:41,This is for passing pilgrims.
00:22:41,00:22:43,"Well, that's you gone there, Nana."
00:22:43,00:22:44,Yeah.
00:22:44,00:22:47,Who wants free wine if they're not allowed?
00:22:47,00:22:48,Yeah.
00:22:48,00:22:49,Outrageous.
00:22:49,00:22:52,That's why I gave it one star.
00:22:52,00:22:58,One exciting Shang Dynasty discovery was a tomb of a fabled character.
00:22:58,00:23:03,"Again, we thought that she was entirely mythological called Fuhao."
00:23:03,00:23:10,She was a wife of one of the emperors and she appears on over 180 of these dragon bones
00:23:10,00:23:13,"as a sort of story, but no one could prove that she ever existed."
00:23:13,00:23:20,And then there was an archaeologist called Jiang Jianxiang who was basically the first
00:23:20,00:23:23,female archaeologist of New China.
00:23:23,00:23:29,So she came about during the Cultural Revolution and she discovered the tomb of Fuhao and it
00:23:29,00:23:36,was the only untouched tomb of a royal that they have ever found in China.
00:23:36,00:23:40,It's basically the equivalent of the Tutankhamun discovery of his tomb.
00:23:40,00:23:41,Everything was intact.
00:23:41,00:23:42,Everything was in there.
00:23:42,00:23:43,I like the way that they call it.
00:23:43,00:23:48,"They say, ""Oh, this is the first untouched tomb that we found and then deliberately"
00:23:48,00:23:49,"go and touch it."""
00:23:49,00:23:50,Yes.
00:23:50,00:23:54,"It's like, you know, they've only done exactly the same as all the previous people have done."
00:23:54,00:23:55,Yeah.
00:23:55,00:23:58,I guess it's because they've left an itinerary of what they've taken from it that that's
00:23:58,00:24:01,"the difference, that we're like, ""Oh, okay, we know everything that was there before you"
00:24:01,00:24:02,"stole it."""
00:24:02,00:24:03,Yeah.
00:24:03,00:24:05,Now you just have to buy a flight to the British Museum in order to see it.
00:24:05,00:24:06,I'm very sorry.
00:24:06,00:24:07,Exactly.
00:24:07,00:24:09,At least you know where it is.
00:24:09,00:24:10,Yeah.
00:24:10,00:24:14,"But she is an amazing character, by the way, Jiang Jianxiang, this archaeologist from China."
00:24:14,00:24:19,And I read about her story in a fantastic website that people must check out.
00:24:19,00:24:23,It's called Trial Blazers as in a trowel for digging.
00:24:23,00:24:27,"And it's a website which is in celebration of women archaeologists, paleontologists and"
00:24:27,00:24:31,geologists who've been doing awesome work for far longer and far greater numbers than
00:24:31,00:24:34,most people realize is the mission statement of the website.
00:24:34,00:24:38,"And it's just packed with all these incredible women who are making these discoveries, like"
00:24:38,00:24:42,"Jiang Jianxiang, who is the first lady of archaeology there."
00:24:42,00:24:48,"And they did discover inside the tomb, they found all these things like 16 human corpses"
00:24:48,00:24:53,that they believe were sacrifices of slaves to come into the afterlife with her.
00:24:53,00:24:57,"They found, as you say, Andy, dogs, there were six sacrificial dogs."
00:24:57,00:24:59,"And shed loads of weapons, right?"
00:24:59,00:25:00,She's a warrior.
00:25:00,00:25:03,"In fact, I think she was general of the army and led the forces to like the biggest victory"
00:25:03,00:25:04,of this entry.
00:25:04,00:25:06,And they found hundreds of weapons with her.
00:25:06,00:25:07,Yeah.
00:25:07,00:25:11,She was the leader of the largest army that we know of in ancient Chinese history.
00:25:11,00:25:12,Wow.
00:25:12,00:25:13,"13,000 men."
00:25:13,00:25:14,Yeah.
00:25:14,00:25:15,It's amazing.
00:25:15,00:25:16,"And if you were that posh, you could get a human sacrifice."
00:25:16,00:25:20,"I think, so the dogs maybe were for, you know, if you couldn't quite afford the people."
00:25:20,00:25:23,"But I think, you know, you've really made it in life when you can convince 16 people"
00:25:23,00:25:25,to die when you die.
00:25:25,00:25:31,They think that possibly the Xiang dynasty had a collection of future human sacrifices.
00:25:31,00:25:37,"A bit like if you can imagine a giant freezer with a load of eagle parts in it, but with"
00:25:37,00:25:39,humans instead.
00:25:39,00:25:40,Wow.
00:25:40,00:25:41,Yeah.
00:25:41,00:25:44,"They reckoned because they would do these big sort of human sacrifices, loads at the"
00:25:44,00:25:45,same time.
00:25:45,00:25:50,"And they could tell that, you know, these people had been not very well fed for a certain"
00:25:50,00:25:52,amount of time.
00:25:52,00:25:54,They can tell that they were kept as prisoners.
00:25:54,00:26:00,And the idea is that whenever you needed a human sacrifice because you wanted to show
00:26:00,00:26:05,"strength because you're the leader or perhaps, you know, for some religious reason, you would"
00:26:05,00:26:10,"go to this pool of sacrificial victims and say, OK, I need 12 sacrifices, please."
00:26:10,00:26:11,OK.
00:26:11,00:26:12,Like a puncture.
00:26:12,00:26:15,"If you were kept in better conditions, after all, it's befitting that a human sacrifice"
00:26:15,00:26:17,should be kept in decent conditions.
00:26:17,00:26:22,"Would you volunteer to be a human sacrifice if you knew that at some point in the future,"
00:26:22,00:26:23,your number would be up and you'd be summed?
00:26:23,00:26:27,How much better would my conditions be than my current conditions?
00:26:27,00:26:31,"Well, I mean, I could see in the background of the Zoom called James that you've got your"
00:26:31,00:26:36,"meat forest and your wide leg behind you, so it can't get much better."
00:26:36,00:26:37,"No, you're right."
00:26:37,00:26:41,"You get to live like Elon Musk, but you will die within two weeks."
00:26:41,00:26:45,Do I have to do really irritating tweets all the time?
00:26:45,00:26:50,"What do you, well, that might be a stretch, James."
00:26:50,00:26:52,Continue as you were.
00:26:52,00:27:01,"You know, speaking of meat forests, the leopard is an animal that likes to put meat into trees."
00:27:01,00:27:02,Really?
00:27:02,00:27:03,Yeah.
00:27:03,00:27:07,"Sometimes it'll kill something like something as big as a small giraffe, for instance."
00:27:07,00:27:12,"And then to stop any hyenas or lions from eating it, but it can't eat it all at once"
00:27:12,00:27:18,"because it's too big, it'll drag it up into a tree and then leave it hanging there and"
00:27:18,00:27:21,then just munch on it when it feels like it.
00:27:21,00:27:26,And there's some examples of leopards carrying such big amounts of meat up these trees that
00:27:26,00:27:34,"it's the equivalent of a human carrying 2,000 Big Macs up two floors in one go."
00:27:34,00:27:35,What?
00:27:35,00:27:39,That's a bad hangover you've got when that's your Saturday.
00:27:39,00:27:41,That poor delivery guy.
00:27:41,00:27:43,Do you love fries with that?
00:27:43,00:27:44,You know what?
00:27:44,00:27:45,Probably not.
00:27:45,00:27:56,"OK, it is time for fact number three, and that is Andy."
00:27:56,00:28:00,"My fact is that if you look at your phone when you're out, half the people around you will"
00:28:00,00:28:02,do the same within 30 seconds.
00:28:02,00:28:03,What?
00:28:03,00:28:04,Half the people around you will look at your phone?
00:28:04,00:28:06,I'd say that's an invasion of privacy.
00:28:06,00:28:10,"Yeah, so be careful what you're looking at."
00:28:10,00:28:13,I assume it's people looking at their own phones.
00:28:13,00:28:16,"I'm almost surprised it's only half, I have to say."
00:28:16,00:28:17,It's true.
00:28:17,00:28:20,"From experience, it's so catching, isn't it?"
00:28:20,00:28:22,"Yeah, it's really bizarre."
00:28:22,00:28:27,"So this is something that I think is probably anecdotally observed a lot, and it's finally"
00:28:27,00:28:35,"been studied by a team at the University of Pisa, and it's a team led by Veronica Maglieri,"
00:28:35,00:28:38,"observed nearly 200 people, and they did so in the field."
00:28:38,00:28:42,"They went out and about, and they looked at men and women in social settings, and there"
00:28:42,00:28:48,"were various trigger individuals that they were observing, and if those trigger individuals"
00:28:48,00:28:52,"looked at their phone very shortly afterwards, about 50% of the people around them did the"
00:28:52,00:28:53,same.
00:28:53,00:28:56,Didn't they say as well that you had to actively engage with the phone as well?
00:28:56,00:29:00,"So they noticed that if you sort of in passing looked at your phone, it didn't trigger off"
00:29:00,00:29:06,"people doing it, but if you picked it up and you did a swipe and you were actively engaging"
00:29:06,00:29:10,"with your phone, that's when everyone started doing it, yeah."
00:29:10,00:29:16,"And this is called the chameleon effect, right, where you mimic what other people are doing,"
00:29:16,00:29:23,"and it was coined by Dr. Tanya Chatrand, and I listened to a podcast that she was in."
00:29:23,00:29:27,"This was the annual reviews conversations podcast, and it was absolutely brilliant."
00:29:27,00:29:32,"She just talked about where she came up with the idea, so she was a student, and there"
00:29:32,00:29:37,was one of her fellow students who was a bit more senior than her.
00:29:37,00:29:42,"He had a beard, and he had this weird mannerism, she said, where he kind of would pull his"
00:29:42,00:29:47,"beard whenever he was doing any work, and she noticed that even though she didn't have"
00:29:47,00:29:51,"a beard, she kept pulling this little bit of skin on the bottom of her chin, and she"
00:29:51,00:29:53,"suddenly thought, wait a minute, why am I doing that?"
00:29:53,00:29:58,Is it because I'm mimicking him because he's got a slightly higher status than me?
00:29:58,00:30:02,"And then that became the subject of, I think, her PhD."
00:30:02,00:30:08,"That is so cool and interesting, and actually, on that note, I had a tutor when I was at"
00:30:08,00:30:14,"university who had a very thick and bushy beard, and at the start of a tutorial, if he was"
00:30:14,00:30:18,"only slightly interested in what you're saying, he would start winding one finger around in"
00:30:18,00:30:23,"his beard, but if you got more intellectually stimulating to him, two fingers would get"
00:30:23,00:30:29,"in there and start grinding around, and by the end of the tutorial, both hands would"
00:30:29,00:30:32,be fully grinding through the beard.
00:30:32,00:30:33,It was nightmare.
00:30:33,00:30:39,It sounds like he had a lice problem to me.
00:30:39,00:30:44,"It does happen, according to Dr. Chartrand in this podcast that I was listening to, it"
00:30:44,00:30:50,"does happen with people who you respect, people of a higher status, but actually, there is"
00:30:50,00:30:54,"a baseline, even if you're with a stranger, someone you've never met, you're never going"
00:30:54,00:30:59,"to meet again, you just kind of sat on a train platform and they're doing something, rubbing"
00:30:59,00:31:03,"their fingers in the massive bushy beard or whatever, then you might copy that, and there"
00:31:03,00:31:07,is a kind of a small amount of it that happens no matter who you're next to.
00:31:07,00:31:13,"This mimicking thing, though, it even happens when it's very disadvantageous to you, so"
00:31:13,00:31:19,"Rock Paper Scissors, the game we all know and love, when people play Rock Paper Scissors,"
00:31:19,00:31:24,"they mimic each other unconsciously, and this has been tested by scientists from UCL who"
00:31:24,00:31:29,set up a series of Rock Paper Scissors games where either one player or both players were
00:31:29,00:31:31,"blindfolded, okay?"
00:31:31,00:31:32,Okay.
00:31:32,00:31:37,"I mean, the most pointless Rock Paper Scissors games imaginable, but when both of them were"
00:31:37,00:31:43,"blindfolded, they didn't imitate each other, but when there was one person blindfolded and"
00:31:43,00:31:49,"they played one of the three options, the sighted player, the one who wasn't blindfolded, was"
00:31:49,00:31:54,"slightly more likely, very slightly more likely to play the same thing, which is baffling,"
00:31:54,00:31:57,"because obviously that's not how you win Rock Paper Scissors, and also you're playing someone"
00:31:57,00:32:01,"blindfolded, just wait until they've made their clear offer and then play the thing that wins."
00:32:01,00:32:02,"However, yes."
00:32:02,00:32:07,"Yeah, what's incredible to me is that we haven't managed to hack into our subconscious and be"
00:32:07,00:32:11,able to win Rock Paper Scissors because it's extraordinary that your subconscious knows
00:32:11,00:32:14,"what your opponent's going to do, but it won't tell you in time."
00:32:14,00:32:15,"No, you're right."
00:32:15,00:32:20,"With this fact about, so you're saying that there's disadvantages where it still happens,"
00:32:20,00:32:26,"but for me, the confusing thing about your fact is that if I was mimicking, as you say,"
00:32:26,00:32:31,"like twiddling a bit of the skin of your chin, that there's nothing there that you're doing"
00:32:31,00:32:35,"that you're conscious of, whereas checking your phone is an active thing."
00:32:35,00:32:39,"So if you see someone else checking their phone, you might go, oh, I should check my"
00:32:39,00:32:40,phone.
00:32:40,00:32:43,"It's a reminder rather than a social mimicking thing, so am I misunderstanding that?"
00:32:43,00:32:44,I don't think so.
00:32:44,00:32:48,"I think sometimes you just check your phone without thinking, right?"
00:32:48,00:32:52,"You're just kind of sat around looking at the leaning tower of Pisa, and your phone's"
00:32:52,00:32:56,"next to you and you think, well, I've seen that leaning tower of Pisa for three hours"
00:32:56,00:32:57,now.
00:32:57,00:32:58,Noffy's changed.
00:32:58,00:32:59,It's still leaning.
00:32:59,00:33:00,He's not moving anywhere.
00:33:00,00:33:01,I'm going to look at my phone.
00:33:01,00:33:02,How was your holiday?
00:33:02,00:33:09,"But yeah, I mean, it's more of a subconscious thing, I think."
00:33:09,00:33:11,Sometimes you just do it reactionary without thinking.
00:33:11,00:33:12,Yeah.
00:33:12,00:33:13,I think that was what they found.
00:33:13,00:33:14,Yeah.
00:33:14,00:33:15,It's a subconscious.
00:33:15,00:33:19,"Obviously, it's conscious once you're writing a long and heartfelt message to your aunt,"
00:33:19,00:33:23,"but the action of picking it up and looking at it, which is what kicks that off."
00:33:23,00:33:28,All the people you could have chosen to write a long and heartfelt message to.
00:33:28,00:33:34,Maybe not leave Dad's relationship with his auntie.
00:33:34,00:33:35,They're very close.
00:33:35,00:33:38,"I do not appreciate you bringing that up, Adam."
00:33:38,00:33:39,It's private.
00:33:39,00:33:40,I'm sorry.
00:33:40,00:33:45,"As well as the chameleon effect, there is a reverse chameleon effect, and what this"
00:33:45,00:33:54,"is is let's say I'm sat opposite you and you're scratching the right-hand side of your face,"
00:33:54,00:34:00,"then to mimic you, I will scratch the left-hand side of my face, and it's as if it's a mirror."
00:34:00,00:34:02,Do you know what I mean?
00:34:02,00:34:06,"But if you do it the other way, so if you scratch the right-hand side of your face,"
00:34:06,00:34:10,"and I scratch the right-hand side of my face, then actually, rather than having positive"
00:34:10,00:34:15,"feelings for me, because you can see that I'm mimicking you, you'll have negative feelings"
00:34:15,00:34:17,for me.
00:34:17,00:34:23,That was a study only in 2020 by a guy called Daniel Casasanto and his team.
00:34:23,00:34:29,"It was in the journal Psychology, and they set up a digital face that would copy what"
00:34:29,00:34:34,"you were doing, and it found that people who were opposite this face when it was doing"
00:34:34,00:34:40,"this weird non-mirroring mirroring, they would feel really negative about it."
00:34:40,00:34:41,Wow.
00:34:41,00:34:44,"Well, it's annoying if you're walking with someone, you go in one direction, and they"
00:34:44,00:34:46,immediately go in the opposite direction.
00:34:46,00:34:49,It kills the conversation.
00:34:49,00:34:52,"There's probably underlying reasons that that's happening, I suppose."
00:34:52,00:34:55,"No, it's a subconscious response, I'm sure of it."
00:34:55,00:35:02,"Do you guys have, at the right-hand side of your head, around the hairline, a little lump"
00:35:02,00:35:03,or bump?
00:35:03,00:35:08,"Well, my hairline is getting a lot further back, because, yes, come on, does the bump"
00:35:08,00:35:09,move as well?
00:35:09,00:35:10,I think the bump stays the same.
00:35:10,00:35:11,The bump's a skull thing.
00:35:11,00:35:13,I'm not sure.
00:35:13,00:35:16,"This is an amazing, you're all feeling your heads now, okay."
00:35:16,00:35:20,"This isn't mimicry, Andy, if you're trying to make us all copy your things."
00:35:20,00:35:27,"I'm trying to make you find your organ of imitation, and this was a phrenological concept"
00:35:27,00:35:33,"in the 19th century, and the idea was that if you had a very lumpy bit of your skull"
00:35:33,00:35:39,"just there, that was an enormous organ of imitation, and you would be a very good mimic,"
00:35:39,00:35:44,"and you might be an actor, but you also might be a liar, you might be a fraudster."
00:35:44,00:35:45,That was where it was.
00:35:45,00:35:50,But you could only really mimic someone else who had a massive growth on the side of the
00:35:50,00:35:51,head.
00:35:51,00:35:52,How big are we talking?
00:35:52,00:35:58,"Is it, you know, like a hockey stick sticking out of your forehead?"
00:35:58,00:35:59,Just there.
00:35:59,00:36:00,"Just, you know, a lump or a bump."
00:36:00,00:36:03,"I can't tell, because obviously, everyone's skulls have, you know, different shapes all"
00:36:03,00:36:06,"the way around, and it's obviously nonsense, but..."
00:36:06,00:36:09,"That's why at the Oscars, when you see all the nominees who are about to be announced,"
00:36:09,00:36:14,"the winner, it's the one with a giant protruding lump that you know is about to get it."
00:36:14,00:36:19,"It sounds to me like it's someone who's been punched in the head so many times, they think"
00:36:19,00:36:23,"the way to make people like me is by imitating them, and so they go and do it."
00:36:23,00:36:26,"I mean, surely that's the cause and effect as far as I'm concerned."
00:36:26,00:36:30,I suppose what we are actually saying here is that phrenology doesn't work.
00:36:30,00:36:31,That's what I'm saying.
00:36:31,00:36:32,Yeah.
00:36:32,00:36:33,Yeah.
00:36:33,00:36:39,"There was a Dutch study by a psychologist that showed, and this is a handy tip for anyone"
00:36:39,00:36:46,"who works in restaurants and is waiting staff, that if you copy the behavior of the customer..."
00:36:46,00:36:49,So you give them the food as well.
00:36:49,00:36:53,"You give them the food, and then you set opposite them, and just have the same thing."
00:36:53,00:36:54,Yeah.
00:36:54,00:37:00,"Go up to them and give them your order, and then they'll go off and do it."
00:37:00,00:37:01,They'll just mimic what you would have been doing.
00:37:01,00:37:02,What do you mean?
00:37:02,00:37:06,"The idea is that if you can relate to the customer more, you're more likely to get a"
00:37:06,00:37:08,tip from them.
00:37:08,00:37:13,So they found that if you were the waiting staff and you went up to them and they made
00:37:13,00:37:17,"the order, if you repeat the order back to them, that almost heightens the fact that you'll"
00:37:17,00:37:21,get a tip because it makes them feel like you're friendly with them.
00:37:21,00:37:24,"If you bend down next to them while they're giving you their order, that's been shown to"
00:37:24,00:37:27,increase tip-inch as well.
00:37:27,00:37:33,"When you say bend down next to them, you bend your knees and sort of get down to their level"
00:37:33,00:37:38,"and still look at them in the face, you don't turn around and you don't give your ass."
00:37:38,00:37:40,"Yeah, don't Ace Ventura it."
00:37:40,00:37:41,Yeah.
00:37:41,00:37:44,"I guess the reason that we sort of do this is because people like it, right?"
00:37:44,00:37:45,And that's why you'll tip.
00:37:45,00:37:49,It's because you like it when your waiter mimics you in a way.
00:37:49,00:37:54,And I read a really interesting article saying copying might be what makes us human.
00:37:54,00:37:56,So we've actually evolved it.
00:37:56,00:37:59,"So a lot of people say it's like innovation and ideas, right?"
00:37:59,00:38:04,And we've invented so much stuff that other species haven't.
00:38:04,00:38:08,But they did this experiment that's really interesting where toddlers and chimps were
00:38:08,00:38:13,"both shown a box with a treat inside it, like sweets or something."
00:38:13,00:38:18,"And then the experimenter showed them how to open the box, but they added a irrelevant"
00:38:18,00:38:20,motion during the opening.
00:38:20,00:38:23,So they tapped the box just before opening it.
00:38:23,00:38:27,"And then they gave it to the child, the toddler or the chimp to see if they were able to open"
00:38:27,00:38:28,the box.
00:38:28,00:38:32,And the chimps realized straight away that the tap was irrelevant.
00:38:32,00:38:35,"So they copied all the other stuff that the human had done, worked out to open the box,"
00:38:35,00:38:37,but could see that the tap was irrelevant.
00:38:37,00:38:40,Whereas the toddlers all still tapped the box.
00:38:40,00:38:42,And this is like over imitation.
00:38:42,00:38:46,"It's like we imitate everything people do, even if it's totally useless."
00:38:46,00:38:50,And the idea is that this is how we've developed this amazing culture.
00:38:50,00:38:55,Because the only way that humans are so successful is that we've developed skills and technology
00:38:55,00:38:56,over generations.
00:38:56,00:38:58,Like no one can make a mobile phone from scratch.
00:38:58,00:39:01,No one really could work out the best way to build a canoe even.
00:39:01,00:39:07,So it's by copying bit by bit exactly what our ancestors have done or what our parents
00:39:07,00:39:09,are doing that makes us really successful.
00:39:09,00:39:13,But it does mean that we do point and a shit like tapping a box with the chip next to us
00:39:13,00:39:15,"going, why are you doing that, mate?"
00:39:15,00:39:18,"Well, that's how we invented drumming as well."
00:39:18,00:39:19,Exactly.
00:39:19,00:39:21,Just tapping the box.
00:39:21,00:39:26,"There is a thing where, like you say, it makes you feel better if people copy you."
00:39:26,00:39:33,But you kind of inherently know how much mimicry there should be depending on a situation.
00:39:33,00:39:38,"And if there is too much or too little, this again, this is according to Dr. Charter and"
00:39:38,00:39:43,"in this podcast that I was listening to, she said that if there's too much or too little"
00:39:43,00:39:49,"mimicry, then it kind of hurts your self-control so you can't self-control as much."
00:39:49,00:39:53,You procrastinate more and you eat more junk food and have worse motor control.
00:39:53,00:39:56,So your reactions are even slightly worse as well.
00:39:56,00:40:01,And all these things can affect you from just someone mimicking you too much or not enough.
00:40:01,00:40:04,"That's really passing the buck, passing the blame on, isn't it?"
00:40:04,00:40:08,"The only reason I had those 8,000 Big Macs or whatever it was, like carried up the stairs"
00:40:08,00:40:14,is because you keep not copying it enough.
00:40:14,00:40:22,"Okay, it's time for our final fact of the show and that is my fact."
00:40:22,00:40:28,My fact this week is that elephants can down 5 pints in under a second.
00:40:28,00:40:33,"Wow, they wouldn't be allowed near that wine tap, would they?"
00:40:33,00:40:36,That's the very definition of alcoholic and loud.
00:40:36,00:40:41,"Oh my god, that Shang Dynasty lake would be drained."
00:40:41,00:40:47,"Just to clarify very quickly, it is obviously the trunk is not the bit that they drink through."
00:40:47,00:40:51,"The trunk is basically a storage unit, isn't it?"
00:40:51,00:40:55,It's where they suck up and they can hold the content in and then they pass it through
00:40:55,00:40:57,to their mouth.
00:40:57,00:41:00,But recently there's new research which was published in the Journal of the Royal Society
00:41:00,00:41:06,"Interface which found that when they suck up, either drink or when they're trying to"
00:41:06,00:41:15,"eat food, that the suction is so great that they can inhale air at 330 miles per hour."
00:41:15,00:41:17,That's ridiculous.
00:41:17,00:41:22,"But I still think in a downing contest, I don't mean to quibble but that doesn't count."
00:41:22,00:41:27,"This is like me taking part in a downing competition, pouring my 5 pints into a big bucket next"
00:41:27,00:41:31,"to me and going I win, oh yeah, I'm just going to drink them later."
00:41:31,00:41:32,No.
00:41:32,00:41:38,It's like you're taking 5 pints and snorting them up your nose and then dribbling it out
00:41:38,00:41:44,"of your nose into your mouth later, which I must admit, I have seen you do that."
00:41:44,00:41:45,I really like it.
00:41:45,00:41:47,Did you say the Royal Society Interface then?
00:41:47,00:41:48,Yes.
00:41:48,00:41:50,Because it is literally about something going into a face.
00:41:50,00:41:51,"Oh, it is."
00:41:51,00:41:53,It's very true.
00:41:53,00:41:59,"Just to contextualize that speed, 330 miles per hour, that is faster than a Japanese bullet"
00:41:59,00:42:00,train travels.
00:42:00,00:42:02,It's incredibly fast.
00:42:02,00:42:05,"In the article, they say that it's 30 times faster than a human sneeze."
00:42:05,00:42:09,It's a picture because that feels like that's the speed of light when you do that.
00:42:09,00:42:12,It's 30 times that.
00:42:12,00:42:20,"This speed of sucking water, I found is six times faster than the world's fastest waterslide."
00:42:20,00:42:25,And then I got right back onto waterslides again from the other week because the world
00:42:25,00:42:30,record fastest speed ever on a waterslide is 57 miles per hour.
00:42:30,00:42:37,"And it was done in 2009 by a guy called Jens Scherer, who is a German advertising executive."
00:42:37,00:42:41,"And according to this article in ""Outside Magazine"" and nowhere else on the internet"
00:42:41,00:42:46,"as far as I can find it, there's a thing in Germany called speed shooting where you have"
00:42:46,00:42:50,to go down a watershoe as quickly as you possibly can.
00:42:50,00:42:56,And this journalist met up with Jens Scherer and tried to work out how to do it.
00:42:56,00:43:01,And apparently the trick is you isolate a couple of muscles in your stomach and you
00:43:01,00:43:02,really work on them.
00:43:02,00:43:06,And then you have to minimise the surface area of your skin on the watershoots.
00:43:06,00:43:12,So the way you do it is you have your shoulder blades on the shoot and just one heel that
00:43:12,00:43:13,goes on the shoot.
00:43:13,00:43:17,And there's only three points that are touching the watershoots and it makes you fly down
00:43:17,00:43:19,"really, really, really fast."
00:43:19,00:43:21,You also have the cannonballs.
00:43:21,00:43:28,"And these are the really fat shooters who, according to Scherer, have no technique, just"
00:43:28,00:43:29,stomachs.
00:43:29,00:43:31,I know which method I prefer.
00:43:31,00:43:34,I'd rather overeat for a year and win that contest.
00:43:34,00:43:38,"Well, you know, Scherer, he takes this really seriously."
00:43:38,00:43:43,"He was very, very small speedos because he thinks that skin is the fastest way of doing"
00:43:43,00:43:44,"it, just human skin."
00:43:44,00:43:46,But he has tried other things.
00:43:46,00:43:51,"He's tried covering himself in soap, in oil, in wax, in a special hydrophobic gel."
00:43:51,00:43:54,He covered himself in to see if he could go faster.
00:43:54,00:44:00,And he also used a type of cream used to tenderise the udders of dairy cows to make himself
00:44:00,00:44:01,go faster on watershoots.
00:44:01,00:44:02,But apparently...
00:44:02,00:44:03,"Wait, hang on."
00:44:03,00:44:04,You said he was an advertising executive.
00:44:04,00:44:07,How has he got access to the cream that he used to lubricate the udders of dairy cows?
00:44:07,00:44:09,"Well, where have you used advertising that?"
00:44:09,00:44:10,I don't know.
00:44:10,00:44:11,Good point.
00:44:11,00:44:12,Yep.
00:44:12,00:44:13,Very good point.
00:44:13,00:44:14,Stacks up.
00:44:14,00:44:20,I always see big poster ad campaigns for cow udder lubrication cream.
00:44:20,00:44:25,I cannot believe you've used this Elephant Trunk fact as an excuse to use all your unused
00:44:25,00:44:26,research from last week.
00:44:26,00:44:27,I know.
00:44:27,00:44:29,You've just sort of stuck a time tunnel three weeks back into the past.
00:44:29,00:44:32,"I promise you, I found this all brand new stuff this week."
00:44:32,00:44:35,I was absolutely devastated I didn't find it three weeks ago.
00:44:35,00:44:39,I do think that a waterslide that was called the Elephant's Trunk that involved firing
00:44:39,00:44:44,you up a slide incredibly fast is a good idea if anyone is out there wanting to...
00:44:44,00:44:46,A reverse waterslide?
00:44:46,00:44:47,Yeah.
00:44:47,00:44:48,"Firing it, yeah."
00:44:48,00:44:49,But is there blow?
00:44:49,00:44:50,Do you think it sucks up it?
00:44:50,00:44:51,"Oh, yeah."
00:44:51,00:44:52,Nice.
00:44:52,00:44:54,"So, do you start in the pool?"
00:44:54,00:44:58,Everyone's in the pool and you don't know one random person every minute is going to
00:44:58,00:45:01,get sucked back up the tube to the very top.
00:45:01,00:45:02,Yeah.
00:45:02,00:45:03,And you don't know who it's going to be.
00:45:03,00:45:04,That's stressful.
00:45:04,00:45:05,And then do you have to walk down?
00:45:05,00:45:06,Yes.
00:45:06,00:45:12,You have to queue down the steps for ages at the end.
00:45:12,00:45:21,"So, one thing elephants do with their trunks is to touch each other's genitals to comfort"
00:45:21,00:45:22,each other.
00:45:22,00:45:30,"If one of their friends is distressed, they will just kind of cop a feel or the alternative"
00:45:30,00:45:34,thing they do is to put their trunk in their friend's mouth to sort of stick it in there.
00:45:34,00:45:36,And that's another way of calming them down.
00:45:36,00:45:37,Yeah.
00:45:37,00:45:38,We should start trying that.
00:45:38,00:45:43,"We used to carry that feather, wasn't it, to tickle the genitals of his friends?"
00:45:43,00:45:44,You can't be unhappy when you're laughing.
00:45:44,00:45:50,"Apparently, they also use it to pinch their parents' genitals sometimes to get their attention."
00:45:50,00:45:55,I read somewhere there's an archive of African elephants' trunk uses and there are more than
00:45:55,00:45:58,250 separate uses for their trunks.
00:45:58,00:45:59,No.
00:45:59,00:46:02,"Which sounds like one of those, you know, difficult interview questions."
00:46:02,00:46:05,How many uses can you think of for a trunk?
00:46:05,00:46:09,But one of them was named as kids getting their mum's attention by pinching her genitals.
00:46:09,00:46:10,Or dad.
00:46:10,00:46:11,Wow.
00:46:11,00:46:12,Wow.
00:46:12,00:46:13,Do you know how you take an elephant's temperature?
00:46:13,00:46:15,Sounds like the start of a joke.
00:46:15,00:46:16,Yeah.
00:46:16,00:46:17,The bum-bum.
00:46:17,00:46:20,Tickle its genitals.
00:46:20,00:46:27,"So it is a thermometer and it is up the bum, but weirdly, the thermometer is a normal sized"
00:46:27,00:46:28,one.
00:46:28,00:46:29,Oh.
00:46:29,00:46:32,Because you'd think it would be a comical oversized elephant one.
00:46:32,00:46:34,"You'd think it wouldn't touch the sides, would you?"
00:46:34,00:46:35,Yeah.
00:46:35,00:46:36,Exactly.
00:46:36,00:46:41,But you've got to keep your arm there for four minutes and it could be really important
00:46:41,00:46:43,to assess the elephant's health as well.
00:46:43,00:46:44,Right.
00:46:44,00:46:45,But that's a long time.
00:46:45,00:46:46,Yeah.
00:46:46,00:46:49,Have we then been using unnecessarily large thermometers?
00:46:49,00:46:52,That's a great point.
00:46:52,00:46:56,That does imply that humans should be able to use one the size of a blade of grass.
00:46:56,00:46:57,Yeah.
00:46:57,00:46:58,You're absolutely right.
00:46:58,00:46:59,It does.
00:46:59,00:47:00,It doesn't matter.
00:47:00,00:47:04,"Elephant no such thing as a fish podcast where they're going, ""Do you know humans use thermometers"
00:47:04,00:47:06,"the same size as us?"""
00:47:06,00:47:07,It's not that.
00:47:07,00:47:09,Because you'd think they'd be the size of a little drawing fin.
00:47:09,00:47:14,It would be the equivalent of me shoving a telegraph pole up my arse.
00:47:14,00:47:20,But people have been studying this since 1936.
00:47:20,00:47:24,I found a scientific paper on elephant body temperatures which said the method used in
00:47:24,00:47:28,"India is to have a Mahut, an elephant keeper, holding a thermometer in his hand, insert"
00:47:28,00:47:33,his well-lubricated arm into the capacious rectum after first removing several of the
00:47:33,00:47:35,huge balls of feces.
00:47:35,00:47:39,"I think, by the way, if we call out James for having used waterslide material, we have"
00:47:39,00:47:45,to call Andy up for using thermometric material about six weeks ago.
00:47:45,00:47:50,Female Asian elephants have exactly the same sex pheromones as moths.
00:47:50,00:47:52,Do they ever get confused?
00:47:52,00:47:55,That must mean there's some very confusing couplings.
00:47:55,00:47:56,Yeah.
00:47:56,00:47:57,"You wouldn't think so, right?"
00:47:57,00:48:05,"It would be a surprisingly heavy knock at the door, the moth looks up."
00:48:05,00:48:08,"The other way round, I guess, right?"
00:48:08,00:48:10,This is in a brilliant book by Tristan Wyatt.
00:48:10,00:48:15,"He actually says in his book, ""Apart from the mating difficulties should they try, male"
00:48:15,00:48:19,"moths are unlikely to be attracted to female elephants."""
00:48:19,00:48:23,The reason being that actually a moth pheromone is usually a couple of different pheromones
00:48:23,00:48:26,"together, one of which is this elephant pheromone."
00:48:26,00:48:29,"But without the secondary pheromone, you're probably not."
00:48:29,00:48:34,"You're going to think that the elephant is a bit like a sexy moth, but not exactly like"
00:48:34,00:48:35,a sexy moth.
00:48:35,00:48:40,Is that the only thing that's holding them back?
00:48:40,00:48:43,"If they're that stupid, they would genuinely get confused."
00:48:43,00:48:48,"Well, I'm just thinking, if a normal tiny thermometer works in an elephant's anus, there"
00:48:48,00:48:53,may be a moth penis works in an elephant vagina.
00:48:53,00:48:57,"It's the ultimate, you don't look like your Tinder profile picture."
00:48:57,00:49:00,"God, imagine the crossbreed."
00:49:00,00:49:05,So these elephants can down five pints in under a second.
00:49:05,00:49:11,What do you think is the fastest time that a human can down a pint of liquid?
00:49:11,00:49:14,A pint of liquid.
00:49:14,00:49:16,"I mean, you see these people drinking a pint, don't you, where they just open their throat"
00:49:16,00:49:17,and it just goes.
00:49:17,00:49:18,"Five seconds, I would say."
00:49:18,00:49:19,Five seconds is done.
00:49:19,00:49:20,You've seen me.
00:49:20,00:49:24,You've seen me do it in less than that.
00:49:24,00:49:27,"One, one, one second, one point, two seconds."
00:49:27,00:49:32,Five seconds is like average first point drinking time.
00:49:32,00:49:33,Last order's at the bar.
00:49:33,00:49:34,Last order.
00:49:34,00:49:35,"Oh, another one."
00:49:35,00:49:38,I'll say two seconds.
00:49:38,00:49:40,"Well, yeah, it's in between those two."
00:49:40,00:49:43,It's 1.75 seconds.
00:49:43,00:49:49,"And this was achieved by Tim Cocker, who was a DJ for XFM and is now a DJ for Virgin Radio."
00:49:49,00:49:55,And I spoke to Mr. Cocker about this and asked him a few questions about his amazing skill
00:49:55,00:49:59,at being able to down drinks.
00:49:59,00:50:04,So he reckons it was 1.75 seconds and it was done on this breakfast show that he was presenting.
00:50:04,00:50:09,But the time began from when he picked up the glass and it stopped when he put the glass
00:50:09,00:50:10,down.
00:50:10,00:50:12,So actually he did it much quicker than that.
00:50:12,00:50:15,"So Anna's 1.2 second or one second might be quite close, I think."
00:50:15,00:50:17,And I asked him how he discovered the skill.
00:50:17,00:50:22,He said it was during a drinking game at Exeter University when he was just doing that and
00:50:22,00:50:26,"suddenly everyone turned around and went, ""What the hell has just happened over there?"""
00:50:26,00:50:31,"But he could literally, if he was on a night out, walk through a bar, pass a table and"
00:50:31,00:50:35,"say to someone with a full pint, ""Hey, what an amazing painting on the wall."""
00:50:35,00:50:40,"They'd turn around for two seconds, turn back, and there's just an empty pint glass"
00:50:40,00:50:41,and he walks to the next table.
00:50:41,00:50:44,"He said, ""Oh, England have just kicked a goal."""
00:50:44,00:50:45,They turn.
00:50:45,00:50:46,Boom.
00:50:46,00:50:50,They have a whole night in 30 seconds.
00:50:50,00:50:54,"What pubs are you going to where you say, ""That's a nice painting on the wall for clubs?"""
00:50:54,00:50:56,"Well, here's an interesting thing."
00:50:56,00:51:00,"The study that I was talking about for this fact, when they were looking into elephants"
00:51:00,00:51:06,"sucking in all of this liquid into their trunk in such speeds, they found that more liquid"
00:51:06,00:51:13,was going into the trunk than was available in terms of space that the trunk had.
00:51:13,00:51:14,Just way more liquid.
00:51:14,00:51:15,"And they're going, ""What's going on there?"""
00:51:15,00:51:20,So they did an ultrasound on an elephant as it was drinking the liquid and they found
00:51:20,00:51:27,that the elephant was dilating the nostrils inside the trunk and they were expanding it
00:51:27,00:51:30,to a total volume of up to 64%.
00:51:30,00:51:32,So its trunk gets bigger as it drinks.
00:51:32,00:51:33,Exactly.
00:51:33,00:51:41,And I'm wondering if your buddy there is expanding his throat to a much larger size to allow for
00:51:41,00:51:45,it to just go down like pouring a pint into a well basically.
00:51:45,00:51:46,Maybe.
00:51:46,00:51:47,Yeah.
00:51:47,00:51:48,Maybe.
00:51:48,00:51:50,Do you think it looks like a giant Adam's apple just sort of appears and then disappears
00:51:50,00:51:52,and they're doing it then?
00:51:52,00:51:57,"He's not a cartoon character guys, he's a suspected DJ."
00:51:57,00:52:02,"I have another food record or two or consumption, rate of consumption record."
00:52:02,00:52:09,There was a story that broke quite recently and it was that during lockdown a man called
00:52:09,00:52:13,Declan Evans from Lincoln broke the world record for the fastest time to drink a Capri
00:52:13,00:52:14,Sun.
00:52:14,00:52:21,Now they're probably only around 250 milliliters or 3 milliliters or something like that.
00:52:21,00:52:22,So half the size I reckon.
00:52:22,00:52:23,Yeah.
00:52:23,00:52:25,"And you're drinking through a straw, aren't you, as well?"
00:52:25,00:52:26,"Well, this is the problem."
00:52:26,00:52:28,The rules are very stringent.
00:52:28,00:52:32,You need to drink an unmodified 200 mil Capri Sun pouch.
00:52:32,00:52:37,The straw still has to be not only stuck to the side but also still in the plastic.
00:52:37,00:52:42,"So it's actually, the record for drinking a Capri Sun is much longer than the record"
00:52:42,00:52:43,for drinking a pint.
00:52:43,00:52:46,It's like by an order of 10.
00:52:46,00:52:47,Wow.
00:52:47,00:52:48,By an order of magnitude.
00:52:48,00:52:49,Yeah.
00:52:49,00:52:50,So the rules.
00:52:50,00:52:52,"More than 10 seconds, really?"
00:52:52,00:52:53,Yeah.
00:52:53,00:52:54,So he broke it.
00:52:54,00:52:59,It actually got re-broken within a month by a lady called Leah Schuttkiver who managed
00:52:59,00:53:01,it in 15.71 seconds.
00:53:01,00:53:03,That I believe is the current world record.
00:53:03,00:53:04,Really?
00:53:04,00:53:05,The rules are so strict though.
00:53:05,00:53:06,Listen to this.
00:53:06,00:53:10,The two and a half millilitres may still be found in the pouch after it is normally drunk.
00:53:10,00:53:16,"Once the attempt has ended, the contents of the pouch must be poured into a 2.5 mil measuring"
00:53:16,00:53:18,spoon and you're filming all of this.
00:53:18,00:53:21,"If any liquid overflows, the attempt will be disqualified."
00:53:21,00:53:22,Yeah.
00:53:22,00:53:23,That's...
00:53:23,00:53:24,It's strict.
00:53:24,00:53:25,That's very strict.
00:53:25,00:53:28,How crazy that the rules are more strict than posting an eagle to the National Eagle
00:53:28,00:53:46,for a positive treatment.
00:53:46,00:53:48,"I'm on that Shriverland, Andy."
00:53:48,00:53:49,At Andrew Hunter M.
