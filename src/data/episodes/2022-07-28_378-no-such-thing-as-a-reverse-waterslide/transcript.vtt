00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:20.240
 Hello, and welcome to another episode of No Such Thing as a Fish, a weekly podcast coming

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:24.200
 to you from four undisclosed locations in the UK.

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:28.840
 My name is Dan Schreiber, I am sitting here with Anna Tyshinski, Andrew Hunter Murray,

00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:32.680
 and James Harkin, and once again, we have gathered round the microphones with our four

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:38.960
 favourite facts from the last seven days, and in no particular order, here we go.

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:41.600
 Starting with fact number one, and that is James.

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:48.240
 Okay, my fact this week is that some dog owners in Alaska are putting spiky jackets on their

00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:54.120
 pets to stop bald eagles from carrying them away.

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:58.200
 How many pets in Alaska have been carried off by bald eagles?

00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:03.440
 To my knowledge, in recent weeks, zero, but that just shows that these jackets are doing

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:04.440
 their job, right?

00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:06.880
 That's a good point, yeah.

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:09.480
 It's so cool, have you guys seen a picture of it?

00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:16.840
 They look like futuristic ravers, like an apocalyptic punk, it's amazing, it's like huge glow sticks

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:21.000
 on the back with their spikes multi-coloured and so on.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.440
 Because I read a few things saying, I can't look out whether the guys selling this stuff

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:29.960
 are just on a genius streak of manipulating dog owners paranoia, because there are lots

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:32.640
 of eagles and they do carry off very heavy fish.

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:38.280
 Well, okay, so there are a lot more bald eagles recently than there have been over the recent

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:40.040
 history, that is for sure.

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:49.360
 There were about 72,000 in the US in 2009 and in 2019 there were 316,000 and that's to say

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:52.960
 nothing of the ones that are in Canada, which is plenty as well.

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:58.120
 So that's good news for eagles, but it might be bad news for dogs because there are anecdotal

00:01:58.120 --> 00:02:03.640
 stories of eagles coming down and picking up dogs and so they come up with these new

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:04.640
 products.

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:11.000
 There's a company, they've got a website called coyotevest.com and they've taken their existing

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:16.680
 waistcoats that they sell to dog owners and they've put, like Dan says, these kind of

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:21.680
 almost like kaplunk sticks, if you can imagine what they look like on the back of them and

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:26.760
 then there's another product called hawk shield which has velcro on it so that when the hawk

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:31.640
 or the eagle comes down, it only picks up the vest and it doesn't pick up the dog a

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:36.480
 bit like, you know, if you have a lizard and someone tries to catch the lizard but it loses

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:37.480
 its tail.

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:38.480
 Yeah.

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:41.880
 It's weak velcro then, because that sounds like it's going to come undone all the time.

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:43.440
 That sounds really annoying.

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:48.420
 I thought you were going to say that the eagle sticks to the velcro when it lands, that you

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:50.880
 get the velcro that just glues it to the dog.

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:54.160
 When your dog comes back and it's just got 20 eagles attached to it.

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:57.160
 Guys, it doesn't matter what they can do, they're not doing it.

00:02:57.160 --> 00:02:58.160
 What?

00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:02.240
 Why is everyone speculating about how they're not blimmin' doing it?

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:07.120
 One tiny little Pomeranian was sadly killed by one in 2020, not even carried off, just

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:08.120
 killed.

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:10.120
 One too many Anna.

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:11.120
 What?

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:13.040
 It's not worth the huge industry.

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:19.160
 The only other evidence I could find of any pet attacks was in 2008, a guy called David

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:24.560
 Hunsaker in Alaska said he had a bald eagle nest outside his house in his garden and at

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:29.800
 one point he found a cat collar in there, which implies, I suppose, that the eagles

00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:31.920
 eaten the cat and left the collar.

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:32.920
 Okay.

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:37.680
 How do you explain the fact that two weeks ago I met a man who was taken by an eagle when

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:38.680
 he was a child?

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:42.160
 Do you really want to know how he explained that, Dan?

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:43.160
 It's true.

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:48.760
 I met a guy who came, a builder who came to our house, he's from Kazakhstan and he told

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:52.640
 my wife that when he was a child he was in a field and the eagle picked him up and carried

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:57.280
 him away and his mother had to run after it and beat it with a stick so he could be dropped,

00:03:57.280 --> 00:03:58.280
 which it did.

00:03:58.280 --> 00:03:59.280
 How do you explain that?

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:03.840
 Did he use that as the reason why he left halfway through the day and didn't come back?

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:05.600
 Sorry, another bloody eagle.

00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:09.840
 I'm not questioning his veracity but I, when I worked in the Scottish Parliament, used

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:13.240
 to have a couple of constituents who were incessantly complaining their sheep were being

00:04:13.240 --> 00:04:20.160
 carried off by sea eagles and I would lump them in the same box as your Kazakhstani builder,

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:24.720
 which is a box of people who have hallucinations of eagles carrying things away.

00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:29.480
 Listen, there was a story in Scotland in 2019 and this might be the one that you're talking

00:04:29.480 --> 00:04:33.920
 about Anna, where sea eagles were blamed for stealing lambs and this farmers, they took

00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:37.400
 it really seriously and they were trying to work out how to prevent it.

00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:41.680
 They were putting up helium balloons to sort of float above where the sheep were, the lamb

00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:43.280
 were, to sort of scare them away.

00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:47.080
 Just make it look like a birthday party for the eagles when they're tucking into their

00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:48.080
 lovely fresh lambs.

00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:49.080
 That's true.

00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:50.080
 It didn't work out though.

00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:53.120
 They said we're struggling a bit with these because they're not staying in the air.

00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:55.800
 So a bit of a flaw with the old balloon technology there.

00:04:55.800 --> 00:05:00.320
 All that amazes me about that is that I guarantee you it's going to be the same farmer I used

00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:06.680
 to talk to in time, is that he's still banging away at the same nonsense drum 14 years later.

00:05:06.680 --> 00:05:07.680
 Wow.

00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:11.600
 Maybe if you've done something 14 years ago Anna, we wouldn't still have this problem.

00:05:11.600 --> 00:05:15.320
 It's actually why I'm not still in the job, they find me.

00:05:15.320 --> 00:05:18.840
 They've got very bad branding, bald eagles.

00:05:18.840 --> 00:05:20.920
 I feel so sorry for them.

00:05:20.920 --> 00:05:22.240
 Why are they called bald?

00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:26.320
 Bald is not what you want to be as an eagle and indeed they're not bald.

00:05:26.320 --> 00:05:27.640
 And I actually, I never really thought about it.

00:05:27.640 --> 00:05:31.720
 I always thought maybe bald eagles were hiding a bald patch that I just had never spotted,

00:05:31.720 --> 00:05:35.360
 but it just comes from an old English word for white, like shining white.

00:05:35.360 --> 00:05:38.800
 Oh, it's going to have white heads today.

00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:44.080
 I always thought it was because the white head made them look bald, but it's not.

00:05:44.080 --> 00:05:48.840
 That makes sense, but I guess bald will come from the same word, I guess, like clean white.

00:05:48.840 --> 00:05:49.840
 Yeah.

00:05:49.840 --> 00:05:53.760
 I think pie bald, a horse that's pie bald is two different colors, and I think the

00:05:53.760 --> 00:05:56.400
 bald bit of that means white headed.

00:05:56.400 --> 00:06:01.400
 So in the USA, it is also very illegal to own an eagle.

00:06:01.400 --> 00:06:02.840
 You can remember it because it rhymes.

00:06:02.840 --> 00:06:03.840
 It's very handy.

00:06:03.840 --> 00:06:06.600
 Is it illegal to own a beagle though, Andy?

00:06:06.600 --> 00:06:07.600
 No.

00:06:07.600 --> 00:06:11.080
 So how are you supposed to remember it?

00:06:11.080 --> 00:06:17.200
 A bald eagle, the national bird of America, you're not allowed to own at all.

00:06:17.200 --> 00:06:21.040
 And if you find a dead one, you're not allowed to keep it.

00:06:21.040 --> 00:06:22.320
 Why would you want to?

00:06:22.320 --> 00:06:29.760
 But there is a US facility called the National Eagle Repository, which effectively is a massive

00:06:29.760 --> 00:06:35.040
 fridge full of dead eagles and eagle body parts, because they're used by indigenous Americans

00:06:35.040 --> 00:06:38.760
 for religious purposes and ceremonies.

00:06:38.760 --> 00:06:45.000
 So this National Eagle Repository receives 30 to 40 eagle carcasses every single day

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:47.200
 they're coming in the door.

00:06:47.200 --> 00:06:48.200
 Yeah.

00:06:48.200 --> 00:06:49.600
 And it's in a suburb of Denver.

00:06:49.600 --> 00:06:52.920
 I mean, it's nowhere very glamorous or weird, it's just in Denver.

00:06:52.920 --> 00:06:56.920
 You wouldn't put it, you know, in Manhattan, which I don't think you'd be putting there.

00:06:56.920 --> 00:06:57.920
 No, right.

00:06:57.920 --> 00:06:58.920
 Or Broadway.

00:06:58.920 --> 00:07:01.880
 And the rental cost would be too high for your enormous eagle fridge.

00:07:01.880 --> 00:07:06.200
 But yeah, so you can't, when you say no one can, you can own an eagle if you belong to

00:07:06.200 --> 00:07:11.880
 one of the, I think it's like 573 recognized tribes who use those eagles in their ceremonies.

00:07:11.880 --> 00:07:12.880
 Exactly.

00:07:12.880 --> 00:07:17.720
 You can apply either for a full eagle or for effectively a franken eagle, you can apply

00:07:17.720 --> 00:07:21.560
 to get the constituent parts of an eagle if they have an eagle which has an eye missing

00:07:21.560 --> 00:07:23.120
 or a wing missing or a tail or whatever.

00:07:23.120 --> 00:07:27.240
 Well, they'll give you an eye from a different eagle and stick it into your eagle, will they?

00:07:27.240 --> 00:07:31.720
 And I think they will, they will send you an eagle kit.

00:07:31.720 --> 00:07:32.720
 What?

00:07:32.720 --> 00:07:35.720
 It's not, it's not build your own eagle.

00:07:35.720 --> 00:07:41.440
 No, no, no, it's things like burning the feathers during ceremonies, yeah, it's, it is for proper

00:07:41.440 --> 00:07:42.440
 rituals.

00:07:42.440 --> 00:07:43.440
 Yeah.

00:07:43.440 --> 00:07:46.520
 But if you find an eagle, you're encouraged to post it, you're literally encouraged to

00:07:46.520 --> 00:07:48.820
 go to the post office and send it to them.

00:07:48.820 --> 00:07:50.880
 This is just as a random person.

00:07:50.880 --> 00:07:54.200
 And there's instructions on their website where they say, you know, if you're going

00:07:54.200 --> 00:07:58.360
 to do it, select a very sturdy cardboard box.

00:07:58.360 --> 00:08:03.920
 Don't pack too many eagles in, you know, don't bend them and make them a bit out of shape.

00:08:03.920 --> 00:08:06.000
 You've got to send them in a frozen state.

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:09.800
 And I'm not sure how you do that because they say don't include gel or ice packs.

00:08:09.800 --> 00:08:14.840
 But if you send them inside a ice cooler, they will send that back to you.

00:08:14.840 --> 00:08:18.000
 So it's sort of like, don't worry, you will get your ice cooler back.

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:19.840
 You've got to double bag them.

00:08:19.840 --> 00:08:23.880
 You know, there's all these rules and you've got to, you've got to ship them via FedEx

00:08:23.880 --> 00:08:26.440
 on any non-holidays that are Monday, Tuesdays or Wednesdays.

00:08:26.440 --> 00:08:31.040
 A paw in turn who's opening the post in that place every single day.

00:08:31.040 --> 00:08:32.040
 Just one is it.

00:08:32.040 --> 00:08:35.840
 Oh, it's another rotten, maggoty eagle.

00:08:35.840 --> 00:08:41.560
 Have you guys heard of wounded in winter beautiful bald eagle, speaking of Native Americans?

00:08:41.560 --> 00:08:42.560
 No.

00:08:42.560 --> 00:08:43.560
 Is that a person?

00:08:43.560 --> 00:08:44.560
 Or is that a...

00:08:44.560 --> 00:08:45.560
 It's a person.

00:08:45.560 --> 00:08:48.320
 His name is also David Bald Eagle for short.

00:08:48.320 --> 00:08:49.320
 Nice.

00:08:49.320 --> 00:08:54.040
 So if you're called David, then it does seem like you can use the words wounded in winter

00:08:54.040 --> 00:08:56.640
 beautiful instead of David.

00:08:56.640 --> 00:08:59.800
 But David Bald Eagle was an actor.

00:08:59.800 --> 00:09:03.600
 He was in dances with wolves as well as a lot of other things.

00:09:03.600 --> 00:09:05.240
 But he had an amazing life.

00:09:05.240 --> 00:09:07.440
 He was in the Second World War.

00:09:07.440 --> 00:09:13.800
 He was dropped into Italy and it's a group of soldiers who fought so fiercely.

00:09:13.800 --> 00:09:17.640
 The Germans called them the devils in baggy pants.

00:09:17.640 --> 00:09:21.360
 And then after fighting there, they took him out again and he was dropped over Normandy

00:09:21.360 --> 00:09:23.680
 during the Normandy landings.

00:09:23.680 --> 00:09:28.120
 But he was accidentally dropped in the wrong place directly over German troops, which meant

00:09:28.120 --> 00:09:33.360
 they could literally just look up and shoot at these guys who were landing on them.

00:09:33.360 --> 00:09:36.400
 He said that we were like clay pigeons coming down.

00:09:36.400 --> 00:09:38.280
 Most of my outfit was wiped out.

00:09:38.280 --> 00:09:40.360
 He said as he came down.

00:09:40.360 --> 00:09:44.160
 So ironic that the bald eagle ended up being like a clay pigeon.

00:09:44.160 --> 00:09:46.040
 Yes, exactly.

00:09:46.040 --> 00:09:47.040
 The medics came.

00:09:47.040 --> 00:09:48.040
 They left him for dead.

00:09:48.040 --> 00:09:51.600
 But then some British soldiers, commandos, came in afterwards and realised that he was

00:09:51.600 --> 00:09:53.840
 still alive and managed to save his life.

00:09:53.840 --> 00:09:59.040
 And then he later became a competitive ballroom dancer, a pro baseball player.

00:09:59.040 --> 00:10:03.160
 And then he became an actor and also danced with Marilyn Monroe.

00:10:03.160 --> 00:10:04.960
 Imagine that for a life.

00:10:04.960 --> 00:10:05.960
 Wow.

00:10:05.960 --> 00:10:06.960
 That was an extraordinary CV.

00:10:06.960 --> 00:10:12.200
 It actually, it's hard to know what job to apply for with that kind of image.

00:10:12.200 --> 00:10:15.240
 You know the bird we started talking about here.

00:10:15.240 --> 00:10:16.240
 What kind of eagle is that?

00:10:16.240 --> 00:10:17.240
 Oh, the bald eagle.

00:10:17.240 --> 00:10:18.400
 The American bald eagle.

00:10:18.400 --> 00:10:24.680
 They really interestingly sound nothing like we have all been conditioned to think they

00:10:24.680 --> 00:10:25.680
 sound.

00:10:25.680 --> 00:10:32.080
 So if you picture the American desert and someone riding a horse through a canyon and he looks

00:10:32.080 --> 00:10:36.120
 up and there's an eagle above and it makes this amazing 'ya' cry, right?

00:10:36.120 --> 00:10:37.120
 That was a very bad impression of it.

00:10:37.120 --> 00:10:38.120
 Try a better one.

00:10:38.120 --> 00:10:39.120
 Try a better one.

00:10:39.120 --> 00:10:40.120
 Yeah.

00:10:40.120 --> 00:10:41.120
 That one.

00:10:41.120 --> 00:10:42.120
 That was really good.

00:10:42.120 --> 00:10:43.120
 Not to make it as bit flimmy.

00:10:43.120 --> 00:10:44.120
 Bit well.

00:10:44.120 --> 00:10:46.120
 Okay, look.

00:10:46.120 --> 00:10:50.240
 Anyway, they don't sound like that at all.

00:10:50.240 --> 00:10:54.040
 They make these pathetic little cheaps and they have to get the sound of a red tailed

00:10:54.040 --> 00:10:59.560
 hawk dubbed over in movies to make everyone think that they sound magnificent and mighty.

00:10:59.560 --> 00:11:00.560
 They don't at all.

00:11:00.560 --> 00:11:03.880
 Well, they used to get the sound of a red tailed hawk, but now I imagine you'll be employed

00:11:03.880 --> 00:11:06.880
 for the job.

00:11:06.880 --> 00:11:12.680
 Okay, so do you know how bald eagles have sex when you got to that part of the podcast

00:11:12.680 --> 00:11:13.680
 already?

00:11:13.680 --> 00:11:16.600
 It took longer than I expected.

00:11:16.600 --> 00:11:17.600
 Is it mid-flight?

00:11:17.600 --> 00:11:23.360
 Yeah, certainly the courting is all mid-flight and that's kind of the interesting part of

00:11:23.360 --> 00:11:24.360
 it.

00:11:24.360 --> 00:11:27.960
 So you'll get two bald eagles, a male and a female, and they'll fly really, really high

00:11:27.960 --> 00:11:33.040
 up together and then they'll lock their talons together and they'll go into kind of a cartwheel

00:11:33.040 --> 00:11:34.760
 death spin.

00:11:34.760 --> 00:11:41.160
 If you imagine like a helicopter where the blades have all gone crazy and all the drivers

00:11:41.160 --> 00:11:46.120
 stopped being able to control it and it goes into a spin, they come right down to the floor

00:11:46.120 --> 00:11:51.360
 and they break it apart at the last minute and that is kind of the courting technique,

00:11:51.360 --> 00:11:54.760
 although sometimes it has to be said they do actually hit the ground.

00:11:54.760 --> 00:11:55.760
 Oh.

00:11:55.760 --> 00:11:58.880
 Well, that's what makes it sexy, the risk.

00:11:58.880 --> 00:11:59.880
 It's the risk.

00:11:59.880 --> 00:12:02.000
 It's like a fistywank, isn't it?

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:03.000
 It's a sort of...

00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:04.000
 A fistywank.

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:07.000
 That's not what you want to say.

00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:08.000
 That's not a fisty.

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:09.000
 That's not what you want to say.

00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:10.000
 There's our title for this week's episode.

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:11.000
 No such thing as a fistywank.

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:15.880
 I think you might be grappling for a spikywank.

00:12:15.880 --> 00:12:18.080
 A fistywank is just a normal wank, isn't it?

00:12:18.080 --> 00:12:23.200
 There was a lot of grappling going on, that's for sure.

00:12:23.200 --> 00:12:24.320
 But is it in the danger?

00:12:24.320 --> 00:12:28.560
 Is that the idea that as they're tumbling down, they're like, we've got three seconds

00:12:28.560 --> 00:12:29.880
 to live, quick.

00:12:29.880 --> 00:12:33.640
 I think if you were to anthropomorphise these eagles, then that's what you would think,

00:12:33.640 --> 00:12:34.640
 for sure.

00:12:34.640 --> 00:12:38.480
 It's like, you know, if you can afford to do such a dangerous thing, then it might mean

00:12:38.480 --> 00:12:39.480
 you're a good mate.

00:12:39.480 --> 00:12:43.120
 God, I can't wait to hear the David Attenborough commentary on this.

00:12:43.120 --> 00:12:46.960
 And so, like on a fistywank.

00:12:46.960 --> 00:12:56.280
 OK, it is time for fact number two, and that is Anna.

00:12:56.280 --> 00:13:02.640
 My fact is that the last emperor of the Shang dynasty built a wine lake and a meat forest

00:13:02.640 --> 00:13:04.400
 for himself.

00:13:04.400 --> 00:13:12.760
 Wow, that is, and what, so he had all loads of wine and meat whenever he needed it, I

00:13:12.760 --> 00:13:13.760
 guess?

00:13:13.760 --> 00:13:17.360
 I think basically, yeah, just a meat forest sounds so disgusting, doesn't it?

00:13:17.360 --> 00:13:20.520
 But yeah, this was a very long time ago.

00:13:20.520 --> 00:13:23.040
 This was over 3,000 years ago.

00:13:23.040 --> 00:13:29.920
 It was the emperor D. Shin, and he was known for being very sort of decadent and prone

00:13:29.920 --> 00:13:31.560
 to a bit of excess.

00:13:31.560 --> 00:13:36.720
 And yeah, he filled a lake on his, oh, I think he dug a lake, in fact, filled it with wine.

00:13:36.720 --> 00:13:41.720
 And then he hung cured meat from the trees all around it.

00:13:41.720 --> 00:13:46.800
 And according to the sources of the dynasty that came immediately after him, he got his

00:13:46.800 --> 00:13:49.800
 courtiers to chase each other through this forest naked.

00:13:49.800 --> 00:13:50.800
 Wow.

00:13:50.800 --> 00:13:51.800
 Interesting.

00:13:51.800 --> 00:13:57.800
 So, if it came from the people who came after him, might it have been a bit of kind of propaganda

00:13:57.800 --> 00:13:59.880
 against him, do you think, or not?

00:13:59.880 --> 00:14:02.640
 It's almost, I mean, I guess it's impossible to say.

00:14:02.640 --> 00:14:06.880
 He was definitely pretty debauched, and the reason he was removed from power, the reason

00:14:06.880 --> 00:14:11.400
 he eventually lost the entire dynasty, which had gone on for about 600 years, is because

00:14:11.400 --> 00:14:14.800
 he was corrupt and, you know, excessive and stuff.

00:14:14.800 --> 00:14:17.840
 But yeah, what's a weird coincidence, and which does imply that could be the case, is

00:14:17.840 --> 00:14:24.920
 that the dynasty that preceded him also fell down because the last emperor built a lake

00:14:24.920 --> 00:14:25.920
 of wine.

00:14:25.920 --> 00:14:28.440
 I think the M.O.G. is not so weird.

00:14:28.440 --> 00:14:32.440
 Surely, one of his advisors should have said, "Wait, this didn't work last time."

00:14:32.440 --> 00:14:35.760
 Look, this time it will work.

00:14:35.760 --> 00:14:38.160
 It's completely different.

00:14:38.160 --> 00:14:42.160
 Both persuaded to do it by their concubines.

00:14:42.160 --> 00:14:46.320
 There's always in this history, there's always some terrible woman forcing them to do it

00:14:46.320 --> 00:14:47.320
 backstage.

00:14:47.320 --> 00:14:48.320
 Yeah.

00:14:48.320 --> 00:14:49.320
 How big was this lake, Anna?

00:14:49.320 --> 00:14:53.320
 Are we talking a genuine lake, or is it a sort of swimming pool called a lake?

00:14:53.320 --> 00:14:54.680
 It's not Loch Ness.

00:14:54.680 --> 00:14:58.680
 It's not Loch Ness, but they, astonishingly, and this must have been the most exciting

00:14:58.680 --> 00:15:02.320
 moment in this archeologist's life, they found a pond that matches up to it.

00:15:02.320 --> 00:15:03.320
 This is in 1999.

00:15:03.320 --> 00:15:07.440
 So this is the first dynasty of which we have actual archeological evidence, so it's not

00:15:07.440 --> 00:15:09.000
 just written stories about it.

00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:13.080
 We've got, like, archeology that matches up, and in 1999, they found an artificial pond

00:15:13.080 --> 00:15:17.840
 in Yanxi, and it's 130 metres long and 20 metres wide.

00:15:17.840 --> 00:15:21.080
 So it's much bigger than your biggest swimming pool.

00:15:21.080 --> 00:15:23.960
 Largely full of water, I imagine, these days.

00:15:23.960 --> 00:15:24.960
 No wine left.

00:15:24.960 --> 00:15:25.960
 No.

00:15:25.960 --> 00:15:26.960
 I don't think.

00:15:26.960 --> 00:15:27.960
 Very diluted by this point.

00:15:27.960 --> 00:15:28.960
 Wow.

00:15:28.960 --> 00:15:29.960
 Right.

00:15:29.960 --> 00:15:30.960
 Yeah, because it's really interesting.

00:15:30.960 --> 00:15:38.240
 These Shang Dynasty, we did think that perhaps it was like a kind of a story or some thing

00:15:38.240 --> 00:15:42.320
 that wasn't actual history, but then, like you say, they did find, I think they found some

00:15:42.320 --> 00:15:45.040
 bones or something with things written on them or…

00:15:45.040 --> 00:15:51.320
 Yeah, they were called dragon bones, and the idea of dragon bones were you would use these

00:15:51.320 --> 00:15:52.920
 for telling the future.

00:15:52.920 --> 00:15:58.240
 So they would write on them, and they would then put them in a fire and crack them.

00:15:58.240 --> 00:16:02.280
 And the bones themselves would be bones from an ox's shoulder, or they would be the flat

00:16:02.280 --> 00:16:04.320
 side of a tortoise shell.

00:16:04.320 --> 00:16:08.800
 And once they cracked, wherever the lines went, that is how you told the future.

00:16:08.800 --> 00:16:10.800
 You followed the crack lines.

00:16:10.800 --> 00:16:15.680
 And for years, we thought that the Shang Dynasty was completely mythological, as with the

00:16:15.680 --> 00:16:16.680
 preceding dynasty.

00:16:16.680 --> 00:16:20.520
 There was not really any evidence except sort of anecdotal evidence.

00:16:20.520 --> 00:16:27.200
 And then in the late 1800s, all of these little, supposed dragon bones were being sold by pharmacies

00:16:27.200 --> 00:16:30.600
 in China because they were seen to be a cure for malaria.

00:16:30.600 --> 00:16:34.920
 There was a guy called Dr. Wang Yerong, who was the director of Imperial College, who

00:16:34.920 --> 00:16:38.600
 had malaria, and was prescribed some of these dragon bones.

00:16:38.600 --> 00:16:42.800
 And he was looking at them going, "Hang on a second, this looks like really old writing."

00:16:42.800 --> 00:16:47.360
 And that's where they realised this was the original writing of the Shang Dynasty, and

00:16:47.360 --> 00:16:48.360
 it was real.

00:16:48.360 --> 00:16:52.360
 Do we trust a guy who thinks that these ox bones cure malaria?

00:16:52.360 --> 00:16:53.360
 Yeah.

00:16:53.360 --> 00:16:56.240
 How's he making it to Imperial College like that?

00:16:56.240 --> 00:16:57.760
 What year was that?

00:16:57.760 --> 00:17:01.560
 This is 1899, and this is the Imperial College of China.

00:17:01.560 --> 00:17:02.560
 And yeah.

00:17:02.560 --> 00:17:03.560
 Oh, sorry.

00:17:03.560 --> 00:17:04.560
 Fair enough.

00:17:04.560 --> 00:17:05.560
 Well, back.

00:17:05.560 --> 00:17:08.880
 So malaria not cured, but you have made an unbelievable archaeological discovery.

00:17:08.880 --> 00:17:09.880
 Exactly.

00:17:09.880 --> 00:17:10.880
 Swings around about.

00:17:10.880 --> 00:17:11.880
 Very cool.

00:17:11.880 --> 00:17:14.200
 They seem, they're kind of like Ouija boards, aren't they?

00:17:14.200 --> 00:17:18.600
 But sort of much harder to read, because I suppose I was looking at the process that

00:17:18.600 --> 00:17:22.960
 you go through when you're interpreting oracle bones, which is what they're also called.

00:17:22.960 --> 00:17:26.680
 And there's an example of one king, for instance, who had a toothache.

00:17:26.680 --> 00:17:32.320
 And what you do is you list a bunch of options for the bone, and then you ask it, you know,

00:17:32.320 --> 00:17:36.360
 which of these options do you pick, and whichever direction the crack goes in, refers to the

00:17:36.360 --> 00:17:37.360
 option.

00:17:37.360 --> 00:17:39.520
 So this king was like, I've got a toothache.

00:17:39.520 --> 00:17:43.200
 So first of all, which of my bastard ancestors is causing it?

00:17:43.200 --> 00:17:45.280
 And he lists four ancestors.

00:17:45.280 --> 00:17:48.400
 And then you've got to burn a bone, and the crack goes to the right, and they're like,

00:17:48.400 --> 00:17:51.600
 okay, it's, you know, it's Bob, Uncle Bob, who's caused it.

00:17:51.600 --> 00:17:54.920
 And then he's like, okay, which animal should I kill to appease Uncle Bob?

00:17:54.920 --> 00:17:55.920
 Should it be a puppy?

00:17:55.920 --> 00:17:56.920
 Should it be a pony?

00:17:56.920 --> 00:17:58.680
 Should it be a bald eagle?

00:17:58.680 --> 00:17:59.880
 And then you ask it again.

00:17:59.880 --> 00:18:02.960
 It's quite a laborious way of having a conversation, I guess.

00:18:02.960 --> 00:18:06.760
 I think it's quite important with these things that they are very difficult to read, because

00:18:06.760 --> 00:18:08.560
 you are making it all up.

00:18:08.560 --> 00:18:13.920
 And so if you're, if it's something that someone else can check your work, then that's not

00:18:13.920 --> 00:18:14.920
 going to work out, is it?

00:18:14.920 --> 00:18:16.880
 It has to be something that you could say this is right.

00:18:16.880 --> 00:18:19.960
 And when anyone says, are you sure, you're like, yeah, look where the crack goes.

00:18:19.960 --> 00:18:21.080
 It's obvious, isn't it?

00:18:21.080 --> 00:18:23.640
 Look, all I'm saying is the toothache was cured.

00:18:23.640 --> 00:18:26.000
 So I'm in the fight of the oracle bones.

00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:27.000
 Wow.

00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:28.000
 It was Uncle Bob all along.

00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:29.000
 There we go.

00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:33.020
 Uncle Bob is still stealing a child, a no-go zone for you.

00:18:33.020 --> 00:18:35.720
 The thing you said about puppies is unfortunately true, isn't it?

00:18:35.720 --> 00:18:39.560
 Because there were lots of shang sacrificial puppies which had been found.

00:18:39.560 --> 00:18:41.880
 And they're normally attached to people's graves.

00:18:41.880 --> 00:18:46.080
 So it was a bonus cavity that would be attached to your grave.

00:18:46.080 --> 00:18:49.360
 And it's mostly middle-class people who did it, we think.

00:18:49.360 --> 00:18:52.040
 And there is a kind of scale range in terms of what you could afford.

00:18:52.040 --> 00:18:55.660
 So if you couldn't afford a full dog to be sacrificed for your grave, you'd get a puppy

00:18:55.660 --> 00:18:58.160
 instead, simply because it was a bit smaller.

00:18:58.160 --> 00:18:59.160
 Wow.

00:18:59.160 --> 00:19:00.160
 Ah, okay.

00:19:00.160 --> 00:19:08.680
 Do you know another reason why Emperor D. Shin was destroyed and why his empire fell?

00:19:08.680 --> 00:19:09.680
 Oh.

00:19:09.680 --> 00:19:14.320
 What a bad question to ask and what a bad way of phrasing it.

00:19:14.320 --> 00:19:20.800
 Did he have a home made of trifle to go through the wheat forest?

00:19:20.800 --> 00:19:21.800
 That's it.

00:19:21.800 --> 00:19:24.800
 No, it was to do again with the religion.

00:19:24.800 --> 00:19:27.760
 And again, this is written by a later dynasty, so it might all be propaganda.

00:19:27.760 --> 00:19:35.480
 But the idea is that his people ate the animal victims which were intended for the spirits,

00:19:35.480 --> 00:19:38.560
 probably because they might have had a bit too much to drink.

00:19:38.560 --> 00:19:40.840
 And so they just got a bit hungry.

00:19:40.840 --> 00:19:44.760
 They looked at the sacrificial animals and they thought, "Oh, we are meant to give those

00:19:44.760 --> 00:19:45.760
 to the spirits."

00:19:45.760 --> 00:19:48.000
 That looks like a tasty little puppy, doesn't it?

00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:50.120
 And the spirits never take them.

00:19:50.120 --> 00:19:52.800
 I mean, we always wake up in the morning and they're still bloody there.

00:19:52.800 --> 00:19:54.480
 The spirits never eat them, do they?

00:19:54.480 --> 00:19:58.600
 I know, it's so relatable just getting a bit peckish after a few drinks and thinking,

00:19:58.600 --> 00:20:04.120
 "I can replace it with another puppy in the morning, can't I?"

00:20:04.120 --> 00:20:09.520
 He was so reviled after, actually in his reign and then immediately after it, that he is

00:20:09.520 --> 00:20:12.880
 now known as the Emperor Zhou.

00:20:12.880 --> 00:20:17.760
 And I've probably mispronounced that, it's about Z-H-O-U, but it's pronounced like Zhou.

00:20:17.760 --> 00:20:21.960
 And the reason he's called that is because that is the word for the bit of a horse's

00:20:21.960 --> 00:20:26.680
 saddle that would tie around the horse's tail to stop the saddle from sliding forward.

00:20:26.680 --> 00:20:30.040
 And that's the bit that when the horse does a poo, it gets covered in poo.

00:20:30.040 --> 00:20:34.520
 So he's gone down in history as bit of a saddle most likely to get covered in shit.

00:20:34.520 --> 00:20:35.720
 That is weird.

00:20:35.720 --> 00:20:39.000
 I thought the next dynasty that came was also the Zhou dynasty.

00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:40.000
 It was.

00:20:40.000 --> 00:20:41.000
 It was extremely confusing.

00:20:41.000 --> 00:20:42.000
 Yeah.

00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:45.640
 But they didn't call themselves after the shitty covered horse thing, surely?

00:20:45.640 --> 00:20:51.920
 It's a slightly different word that to me sounds almost indistinguishable to Dan slightly

00:20:51.920 --> 00:20:52.920
 more adapted.

00:20:52.920 --> 00:20:57.720
 Mandarin is probably sounds different, but one sounds like Zhou and one sounds like Zhou.

00:20:57.720 --> 00:20:58.720
 Oh, OK.

00:20:58.720 --> 00:20:59.720
 Oh, see.

00:20:59.720 --> 00:21:06.120
 Can I just quickly ask just back to the very first fact, where did they get the wine from

00:21:06.120 --> 00:21:07.760
 to fill a lake?

00:21:07.760 --> 00:21:09.000
 That's a lot of wine.

00:21:09.000 --> 00:21:14.040
 Was it a bit of a faked botched job where it was mostly water and then there was just

00:21:14.040 --> 00:21:16.440
 a top layer of wine kind of thing?

00:21:16.440 --> 00:21:18.600
 I mean, it's not like oil and water.

00:21:18.600 --> 00:21:22.080
 People don't say they like wine and water because wine and water do mix.

00:21:22.080 --> 00:21:24.080
 You can't just keep it on the top layer.

00:21:24.080 --> 00:21:29.440
 Was it just like a normal lake and Jesus walked past?

00:21:29.440 --> 00:21:33.160
 Every time Jesus walks past your taps, oh, god damn it, I can't do the washing up anymore.

00:21:33.160 --> 00:21:34.160
 Jesus Christ.

00:21:34.160 --> 00:21:35.160
 Oh, yes.

00:21:35.160 --> 00:21:36.160
 That's my name.

00:21:36.160 --> 00:21:37.160
 It's a good question.

00:21:37.160 --> 00:21:41.280
 And I don't think it was the wine as we know it was some kind of alcohol, which is usually

00:21:41.280 --> 00:21:43.400
 referred to as wine these days.

00:21:43.400 --> 00:21:44.400
 Maybe more like beer.

00:21:44.400 --> 00:21:49.440
 But I always wonder this as well, when in English historical sources, medieval times,

00:21:49.440 --> 00:21:53.760
 they talk about fountains flowing with wine and, you know, kings went through a phase of

00:21:53.760 --> 00:21:58.520
 about 500 years of whenever they were celebrating anything, they had a birthday or a foreign

00:21:58.520 --> 00:22:02.480
 dignitary came to visit, the pipes would flow with wine.

00:22:02.480 --> 00:22:05.800
 And no one knows how they did it, but it's in all these sources.

00:22:05.800 --> 00:22:11.040
 I think it started in the 1200s with Edward Longshanks and there was a royal visit and

00:22:11.040 --> 00:22:14.080
 it was like, you know, London flowed with wine.

00:22:14.080 --> 00:22:16.480
 I've got no idea how they made that happen.

00:22:16.480 --> 00:22:17.480
 What's going on?

00:22:17.480 --> 00:22:21.360
 There is, there's, we might have said this before, but there is a wine kind of tap, isn't

00:22:21.360 --> 00:22:23.320
 there somewhere in Italy, I think.

00:22:23.320 --> 00:22:27.240
 There's like some pipes of wine where you can just go and fill up your bucket wherever

00:22:27.240 --> 00:22:28.240
 you want.

00:22:28.240 --> 00:22:29.240
 Yes, that's right.

00:22:29.240 --> 00:22:30.240
 Or glass.

00:22:30.240 --> 00:22:31.240
 Yes, there is.

00:22:31.240 --> 00:22:32.240
 That's very cool.

00:22:32.240 --> 00:22:35.160
 Although, yeah, I was reading some TripAdvisor reviews of that and they did say there's

00:22:35.160 --> 00:22:39.280
 a sign outside it saying, "Lauts and drunkards not welcome."

00:22:39.280 --> 00:22:40.280
 Right.

00:22:40.280 --> 00:22:41.280
 This is for passing pilgrims.

00:22:41.280 --> 00:22:43.440
 Well, that's you gone there, Nana.

00:22:43.440 --> 00:22:44.440
 Yeah.

00:22:44.440 --> 00:22:47.680
 Who wants free wine if they're not allowed?

00:22:47.680 --> 00:22:48.680
 Yeah.

00:22:48.680 --> 00:22:49.680
 Outrageous.

00:22:49.680 --> 00:22:52.720
 That's why I gave it one star.

00:22:52.720 --> 00:22:58.400
 One exciting Shang Dynasty discovery was a tomb of a fabled character.

00:22:58.400 --> 00:23:03.160
 Again, we thought that she was entirely mythological called Fuhao.

00:23:03.160 --> 00:23:10.280
 She was a wife of one of the emperors and she appears on over 180 of these dragon bones

00:23:10.280 --> 00:23:13.960
 as a sort of story, but no one could prove that she ever existed.

00:23:13.960 --> 00:23:20.440
 And then there was an archaeologist called Jiang Jianxiang who was basically the first

00:23:20.440 --> 00:23:23.040
 female archaeologist of New China.

00:23:23.040 --> 00:23:29.880
 So she came about during the Cultural Revolution and she discovered the tomb of Fuhao and it

00:23:29.880 --> 00:23:36.120
 was the only untouched tomb of a royal that they have ever found in China.

00:23:36.120 --> 00:23:40.500
 It's basically the equivalent of the Tutankhamun discovery of his tomb.

00:23:40.500 --> 00:23:41.580
 Everything was intact.

00:23:41.580 --> 00:23:42.580
 Everything was in there.

00:23:42.580 --> 00:23:43.920
 I like the way that they call it.

00:23:43.920 --> 00:23:48.400
 They say, "Oh, this is the first untouched tomb that we found and then deliberately

00:23:48.400 --> 00:23:49.400
 go and touch it."

00:23:49.400 --> 00:23:50.400
 Yes.

00:23:50.400 --> 00:23:54.000
 It's like, you know, they've only done exactly the same as all the previous people have done.

00:23:54.000 --> 00:23:55.000
 Yeah.

00:23:55.000 --> 00:23:58.320
 I guess it's because they've left an itinerary of what they've taken from it that that's

00:23:58.320 --> 00:24:01.680
 the difference, that we're like, "Oh, okay, we know everything that was there before you

00:24:01.680 --> 00:24:02.680
 stole it."

00:24:02.680 --> 00:24:03.680
 Yeah.

00:24:03.680 --> 00:24:05.320
 Now you just have to buy a flight to the British Museum in order to see it.

00:24:05.320 --> 00:24:06.320
 I'm very sorry.

00:24:06.320 --> 00:24:07.320
 Exactly.

00:24:07.320 --> 00:24:09.320
 At least you know where it is.

00:24:09.320 --> 00:24:10.320
 Yeah.

00:24:10.320 --> 00:24:14.960
 But she is an amazing character, by the way, Jiang Jianxiang, this archaeologist from China.

00:24:14.960 --> 00:24:19.120
 And I read about her story in a fantastic website that people must check out.

00:24:19.120 --> 00:24:23.160
 It's called Trial Blazers as in a trowel for digging.

00:24:23.160 --> 00:24:27.000
 And it's a website which is in celebration of women archaeologists, paleontologists and

00:24:27.000 --> 00:24:31.000
 geologists who've been doing awesome work for far longer and far greater numbers than

00:24:31.000 --> 00:24:34.400
 most people realize is the mission statement of the website.

00:24:34.400 --> 00:24:38.520
 And it's just packed with all these incredible women who are making these discoveries, like

00:24:38.520 --> 00:24:42.440
 Jiang Jianxiang, who is the first lady of archaeology there.

00:24:42.440 --> 00:24:48.640
 And they did discover inside the tomb, they found all these things like 16 human corpses

00:24:48.640 --> 00:24:53.800
 that they believe were sacrifices of slaves to come into the afterlife with her.

00:24:53.800 --> 00:24:57.560
 They found, as you say, Andy, dogs, there were six sacrificial dogs.

00:24:57.560 --> 00:24:59.160
 And shed loads of weapons, right?

00:24:59.160 --> 00:25:00.160
 She's a warrior.

00:25:00.160 --> 00:25:03.400
 In fact, I think she was general of the army and led the forces to like the biggest victory

00:25:03.400 --> 00:25:04.400
 of this entry.

00:25:04.400 --> 00:25:06.280
 And they found hundreds of weapons with her.

00:25:06.280 --> 00:25:07.280
 Yeah.

00:25:07.280 --> 00:25:11.040
 She was the leader of the largest army that we know of in ancient Chinese history.

00:25:11.040 --> 00:25:12.040
 Wow.

00:25:12.040 --> 00:25:13.040
 13,000 men.

00:25:13.040 --> 00:25:14.040
 Yeah.

00:25:14.040 --> 00:25:15.040
 It's amazing.

00:25:15.040 --> 00:25:16.680
 And if you were that posh, you could get a human sacrifice.

00:25:16.680 --> 00:25:20.480
 I think, so the dogs maybe were for, you know, if you couldn't quite afford the people.

00:25:20.480 --> 00:25:23.640
 But I think, you know, you've really made it in life when you can convince 16 people

00:25:23.640 --> 00:25:25.360
 to die when you die.

00:25:25.360 --> 00:25:31.960
 They think that possibly the Xiang dynasty had a collection of future human sacrifices.

00:25:31.960 --> 00:25:37.680
 A bit like if you can imagine a giant freezer with a load of eagle parts in it, but with

00:25:37.680 --> 00:25:39.200
 humans instead.

00:25:39.200 --> 00:25:40.200
 Wow.

00:25:40.200 --> 00:25:41.200
 Yeah.

00:25:41.200 --> 00:25:44.920
 They reckoned because they would do these big sort of human sacrifices, loads at the

00:25:44.920 --> 00:25:45.920
 same time.

00:25:45.920 --> 00:25:50.720
 And they could tell that, you know, these people had been not very well fed for a certain

00:25:50.720 --> 00:25:52.520
 amount of time.

00:25:52.520 --> 00:25:54.840
 They can tell that they were kept as prisoners.

00:25:54.840 --> 00:26:00.280
 And the idea is that whenever you needed a human sacrifice because you wanted to show

00:26:00.280 --> 00:26:05.080
 strength because you're the leader or perhaps, you know, for some religious reason, you would

00:26:05.080 --> 00:26:10.520
 go to this pool of sacrificial victims and say, OK, I need 12 sacrifices, please.

00:26:10.520 --> 00:26:11.520
 OK.

00:26:11.520 --> 00:26:12.520
 Like a puncture.

00:26:12.520 --> 00:26:15.720
 If you were kept in better conditions, after all, it's befitting that a human sacrifice

00:26:15.720 --> 00:26:17.520
 should be kept in decent conditions.

00:26:17.520 --> 00:26:22.320
 Would you volunteer to be a human sacrifice if you knew that at some point in the future,

00:26:22.320 --> 00:26:23.480
 your number would be up and you'd be summed?

00:26:23.480 --> 00:26:27.240
 How much better would my conditions be than my current conditions?

00:26:27.240 --> 00:26:31.000
 Well, I mean, I could see in the background of the Zoom called James that you've got your

00:26:31.000 --> 00:26:36.040
 meat forest and your wide leg behind you, so it can't get much better.

00:26:36.040 --> 00:26:37.400
 No, you're right.

00:26:37.400 --> 00:26:41.920
 You get to live like Elon Musk, but you will die within two weeks.

00:26:41.920 --> 00:26:45.240
 Do I have to do really irritating tweets all the time?

00:26:45.240 --> 00:26:50.800
 What do you, well, that might be a stretch, James.

00:26:50.800 --> 00:26:52.800
 Continue as you were.

00:26:52.800 --> 00:27:01.520
 You know, speaking of meat forests, the leopard is an animal that likes to put meat into trees.

00:27:01.520 --> 00:27:02.520
 Really?

00:27:02.520 --> 00:27:03.520
 Yeah.

00:27:03.520 --> 00:27:07.280
 Sometimes it'll kill something like something as big as a small giraffe, for instance.

00:27:07.280 --> 00:27:12.960
 And then to stop any hyenas or lions from eating it, but it can't eat it all at once

00:27:12.960 --> 00:27:18.120
 because it's too big, it'll drag it up into a tree and then leave it hanging there and

00:27:18.120 --> 00:27:21.120
 then just munch on it when it feels like it.

00:27:21.120 --> 00:27:26.480
 And there's some examples of leopards carrying such big amounts of meat up these trees that

00:27:26.480 --> 00:27:34.120
 it's the equivalent of a human carrying 2,000 Big Macs up two floors in one go.

00:27:34.120 --> 00:27:35.120
 What?

00:27:35.120 --> 00:27:39.560
 That's a bad hangover you've got when that's your Saturday.

00:27:39.560 --> 00:27:41.680
 That poor delivery guy.

00:27:41.680 --> 00:27:43.360
 Do you love fries with that?

00:27:43.360 --> 00:27:44.360
 You know what?

00:27:44.360 --> 00:27:45.360
 Probably not.

00:27:45.360 --> 00:27:56.400
 OK, it is time for fact number three, and that is Andy.

00:27:56.400 --> 00:28:00.520
 My fact is that if you look at your phone when you're out, half the people around you will

00:28:00.520 --> 00:28:02.720
 do the same within 30 seconds.

00:28:02.720 --> 00:28:03.720
 What?

00:28:03.720 --> 00:28:04.960
 Half the people around you will look at your phone?

00:28:04.960 --> 00:28:06.600
 I'd say that's an invasion of privacy.

00:28:06.600 --> 00:28:10.200
 Yeah, so be careful what you're looking at.

00:28:10.200 --> 00:28:13.240
 I assume it's people looking at their own phones.

00:28:13.240 --> 00:28:16.680
 I'm almost surprised it's only half, I have to say.

00:28:16.680 --> 00:28:17.680
 It's true.

00:28:17.680 --> 00:28:20.360
 From experience, it's so catching, isn't it?

00:28:20.360 --> 00:28:22.600
 Yeah, it's really bizarre.

00:28:22.600 --> 00:28:27.800
 So this is something that I think is probably anecdotally observed a lot, and it's finally

00:28:27.800 --> 00:28:35.720
 been studied by a team at the University of Pisa, and it's a team led by Veronica Maglieri,

00:28:35.720 --> 00:28:38.000
 observed nearly 200 people, and they did so in the field.

00:28:38.000 --> 00:28:42.720
 They went out and about, and they looked at men and women in social settings, and there

00:28:42.720 --> 00:28:48.040
 were various trigger individuals that they were observing, and if those trigger individuals

00:28:48.040 --> 00:28:52.720
 looked at their phone very shortly afterwards, about 50% of the people around them did the

00:28:52.720 --> 00:28:53.720
 same.

00:28:53.720 --> 00:28:56.960
 Didn't they say as well that you had to actively engage with the phone as well?

00:28:56.960 --> 00:29:00.780
 So they noticed that if you sort of in passing looked at your phone, it didn't trigger off

00:29:00.780 --> 00:29:06.500
 people doing it, but if you picked it up and you did a swipe and you were actively engaging

00:29:06.500 --> 00:29:10.920
 with your phone, that's when everyone started doing it, yeah.

00:29:10.920 --> 00:29:16.400
 And this is called the chameleon effect, right, where you mimic what other people are doing,

00:29:16.400 --> 00:29:23.120
 and it was coined by Dr. Tanya Chatrand, and I listened to a podcast that she was in.

00:29:23.120 --> 00:29:27.720
 This was the annual reviews conversations podcast, and it was absolutely brilliant.

00:29:27.720 --> 00:29:32.640
 She just talked about where she came up with the idea, so she was a student, and there

00:29:32.640 --> 00:29:37.200
 was one of her fellow students who was a bit more senior than her.

00:29:37.200 --> 00:29:42.240
 He had a beard, and he had this weird mannerism, she said, where he kind of would pull his

00:29:42.240 --> 00:29:47.000
 beard whenever he was doing any work, and she noticed that even though she didn't have

00:29:47.000 --> 00:29:51.480
 a beard, she kept pulling this little bit of skin on the bottom of her chin, and she

00:29:51.480 --> 00:29:53.960
 suddenly thought, wait a minute, why am I doing that?

00:29:53.960 --> 00:29:58.500
 Is it because I'm mimicking him because he's got a slightly higher status than me?

00:29:58.500 --> 00:30:02.700
 And then that became the subject of, I think, her PhD.

00:30:02.700 --> 00:30:08.200
 That is so cool and interesting, and actually, on that note, I had a tutor when I was at

00:30:08.200 --> 00:30:14.600
 university who had a very thick and bushy beard, and at the start of a tutorial, if he was

00:30:14.600 --> 00:30:18.480
 only slightly interested in what you're saying, he would start winding one finger around in

00:30:18.480 --> 00:30:23.160
 his beard, but if you got more intellectually stimulating to him, two fingers would get

00:30:23.160 --> 00:30:29.640
 in there and start grinding around, and by the end of the tutorial, both hands would

00:30:29.640 --> 00:30:32.880
 be fully grinding through the beard.

00:30:32.880 --> 00:30:33.880
 It was nightmare.

00:30:33.880 --> 00:30:39.800
 It sounds like he had a lice problem to me.

00:30:39.800 --> 00:30:44.720
 It does happen, according to Dr. Chartrand in this podcast that I was listening to, it

00:30:44.720 --> 00:30:50.000
 does happen with people who you respect, people of a higher status, but actually, there is

00:30:50.000 --> 00:30:54.100
 a baseline, even if you're with a stranger, someone you've never met, you're never going

00:30:54.100 --> 00:30:59.160
 to meet again, you just kind of sat on a train platform and they're doing something, rubbing

00:30:59.160 --> 00:31:03.760
 their fingers in the massive bushy beard or whatever, then you might copy that, and there

00:31:03.760 --> 00:31:07.880
 is a kind of a small amount of it that happens no matter who you're next to.

00:31:07.880 --> 00:31:13.480
 This mimicking thing, though, it even happens when it's very disadvantageous to you, so

00:31:13.480 --> 00:31:19.440
 Rock Paper Scissors, the game we all know and love, when people play Rock Paper Scissors,

00:31:19.440 --> 00:31:24.560
 they mimic each other unconsciously, and this has been tested by scientists from UCL who

00:31:24.560 --> 00:31:29.680
 set up a series of Rock Paper Scissors games where either one player or both players were

00:31:29.680 --> 00:31:31.080
 blindfolded, okay?

00:31:31.080 --> 00:31:32.080
 Okay.

00:31:32.080 --> 00:31:37.480
 I mean, the most pointless Rock Paper Scissors games imaginable, but when both of them were

00:31:37.480 --> 00:31:43.440
 blindfolded, they didn't imitate each other, but when there was one person blindfolded and

00:31:43.440 --> 00:31:49.200
 they played one of the three options, the sighted player, the one who wasn't blindfolded, was

00:31:49.200 --> 00:31:54.240
 slightly more likely, very slightly more likely to play the same thing, which is baffling,

00:31:54.240 --> 00:31:57.280
 because obviously that's not how you win Rock Paper Scissors, and also you're playing someone

00:31:57.280 --> 00:32:01.960
 blindfolded, just wait until they've made their clear offer and then play the thing that wins.

00:32:01.960 --> 00:32:02.960
 However, yes.

00:32:02.960 --> 00:32:07.360
 Yeah, what's incredible to me is that we haven't managed to hack into our subconscious and be

00:32:07.360 --> 00:32:11.760
 able to win Rock Paper Scissors because it's extraordinary that your subconscious knows

00:32:11.760 --> 00:32:14.440
 what your opponent's going to do, but it won't tell you in time.

00:32:14.440 --> 00:32:15.440
 No, you're right.

00:32:15.440 --> 00:32:20.320
 With this fact about, so you're saying that there's disadvantages where it still happens,

00:32:20.320 --> 00:32:26.360
 but for me, the confusing thing about your fact is that if I was mimicking, as you say,

00:32:26.360 --> 00:32:31.320
 like twiddling a bit of the skin of your chin, that there's nothing there that you're doing

00:32:31.320 --> 00:32:35.800
 that you're conscious of, whereas checking your phone is an active thing.

00:32:35.800 --> 00:32:39.000
 So if you see someone else checking their phone, you might go, oh, I should check my

00:32:39.000 --> 00:32:40.000
 phone.

00:32:40.000 --> 00:32:43.880
 It's a reminder rather than a social mimicking thing, so am I misunderstanding that?

00:32:43.880 --> 00:32:44.880
 I don't think so.

00:32:44.880 --> 00:32:48.620
 I think sometimes you just check your phone without thinking, right?

00:32:48.620 --> 00:32:52.920
 You're just kind of sat around looking at the leaning tower of Pisa, and your phone's

00:32:52.920 --> 00:32:56.120
 next to you and you think, well, I've seen that leaning tower of Pisa for three hours

00:32:56.120 --> 00:32:57.120
 now.

00:32:57.120 --> 00:32:58.120
 Noffy's changed.

00:32:58.120 --> 00:32:59.120
 It's still leaning.

00:32:59.120 --> 00:33:00.120
 He's not moving anywhere.

00:33:00.120 --> 00:33:01.120
 I'm going to look at my phone.

00:33:01.120 --> 00:33:02.120
 How was your holiday?

00:33:02.120 --> 00:33:09.280
 But yeah, I mean, it's more of a subconscious thing, I think.

00:33:09.280 --> 00:33:11.720
 Sometimes you just do it reactionary without thinking.

00:33:11.720 --> 00:33:12.720
 Yeah.

00:33:12.720 --> 00:33:13.720
 I think that was what they found.

00:33:13.720 --> 00:33:14.720
 Yeah.

00:33:14.720 --> 00:33:15.720
 It's a subconscious.

00:33:15.720 --> 00:33:19.680
 Obviously, it's conscious once you're writing a long and heartfelt message to your aunt,

00:33:19.680 --> 00:33:23.920
 but the action of picking it up and looking at it, which is what kicks that off.

00:33:23.920 --> 00:33:28.120
 All the people you could have chosen to write a long and heartfelt message to.

00:33:28.120 --> 00:33:34.120
 Maybe not leave Dad's relationship with his auntie.

00:33:34.120 --> 00:33:35.120
 They're very close.

00:33:35.120 --> 00:33:38.120
 I do not appreciate you bringing that up, Adam.

00:33:38.120 --> 00:33:39.120
 It's private.

00:33:39.120 --> 00:33:40.120
 I'm sorry.

00:33:40.120 --> 00:33:45.360
 As well as the chameleon effect, there is a reverse chameleon effect, and what this

00:33:45.360 --> 00:33:54.280
 is is let's say I'm sat opposite you and you're scratching the right-hand side of your face,

00:33:54.280 --> 00:34:00.800
 then to mimic you, I will scratch the left-hand side of my face, and it's as if it's a mirror.

00:34:00.800 --> 00:34:02.720
 Do you know what I mean?

00:34:02.720 --> 00:34:06.720
 But if you do it the other way, so if you scratch the right-hand side of your face,

00:34:06.720 --> 00:34:10.960
 and I scratch the right-hand side of my face, then actually, rather than having positive

00:34:10.960 --> 00:34:15.800
 feelings for me, because you can see that I'm mimicking you, you'll have negative feelings

00:34:15.800 --> 00:34:17.640
 for me.

00:34:17.640 --> 00:34:23.280
 That was a study only in 2020 by a guy called Daniel Casasanto and his team.

00:34:23.280 --> 00:34:29.700
 It was in the journal Psychology, and they set up a digital face that would copy what

00:34:29.700 --> 00:34:34.840
 you were doing, and it found that people who were opposite this face when it was doing

00:34:34.840 --> 00:34:40.040
 this weird non-mirroring mirroring, they would feel really negative about it.

00:34:40.040 --> 00:34:41.040
 Wow.

00:34:41.040 --> 00:34:44.800
 Well, it's annoying if you're walking with someone, you go in one direction, and they

00:34:44.800 --> 00:34:46.760
 immediately go in the opposite direction.

00:34:46.760 --> 00:34:49.120
 It kills the conversation.

00:34:49.120 --> 00:34:52.240
 There's probably underlying reasons that that's happening, I suppose.

00:34:52.240 --> 00:34:55.680
 No, it's a subconscious response, I'm sure of it.

00:34:55.680 --> 00:35:02.020
 Do you guys have, at the right-hand side of your head, around the hairline, a little lump

00:35:02.020 --> 00:35:03.020
 or bump?

00:35:03.020 --> 00:35:08.000
 Well, my hairline is getting a lot further back, because, yes, come on, does the bump

00:35:08.000 --> 00:35:09.000
 move as well?

00:35:09.000 --> 00:35:10.000
 I think the bump stays the same.

00:35:10.000 --> 00:35:11.800
 The bump's a skull thing.

00:35:11.800 --> 00:35:13.120
 I'm not sure.

00:35:13.120 --> 00:35:16.440
 This is an amazing, you're all feeling your heads now, okay.

00:35:16.440 --> 00:35:20.240
 This isn't mimicry, Andy, if you're trying to make us all copy your things.

00:35:20.240 --> 00:35:27.520
 I'm trying to make you find your organ of imitation, and this was a phrenological concept

00:35:27.520 --> 00:35:33.440
 in the 19th century, and the idea was that if you had a very lumpy bit of your skull

00:35:33.440 --> 00:35:39.160
 just there, that was an enormous organ of imitation, and you would be a very good mimic,

00:35:39.160 --> 00:35:44.080
 and you might be an actor, but you also might be a liar, you might be a fraudster.

00:35:44.080 --> 00:35:45.960
 That was where it was.

00:35:45.960 --> 00:35:50.560
 But you could only really mimic someone else who had a massive growth on the side of the

00:35:50.560 --> 00:35:51.560
 head.

00:35:51.560 --> 00:35:52.560
 How big are we talking?

00:35:52.560 --> 00:35:58.040
 Is it, you know, like a hockey stick sticking out of your forehead?

00:35:58.040 --> 00:35:59.040
 Just there.

00:35:59.040 --> 00:36:00.040
 Just, you know, a lump or a bump.

00:36:00.040 --> 00:36:03.560
 I can't tell, because obviously, everyone's skulls have, you know, different shapes all

00:36:03.560 --> 00:36:06.020
 the way around, and it's obviously nonsense, but...

00:36:06.020 --> 00:36:09.720
 That's why at the Oscars, when you see all the nominees who are about to be announced,

00:36:09.720 --> 00:36:14.480
 the winner, it's the one with a giant protruding lump that you know is about to get it.

00:36:14.480 --> 00:36:19.080
 It sounds to me like it's someone who's been punched in the head so many times, they think

00:36:19.080 --> 00:36:23.180
 the way to make people like me is by imitating them, and so they go and do it.

00:36:23.180 --> 00:36:26.920
 I mean, surely that's the cause and effect as far as I'm concerned.

00:36:26.920 --> 00:36:30.480
 I suppose what we are actually saying here is that phrenology doesn't work.

00:36:30.480 --> 00:36:31.480
 That's what I'm saying.

00:36:31.480 --> 00:36:32.480
 Yeah.

00:36:32.480 --> 00:36:33.480
 Yeah.

00:36:33.480 --> 00:36:39.120
 There was a Dutch study by a psychologist that showed, and this is a handy tip for anyone

00:36:39.120 --> 00:36:46.160
 who works in restaurants and is waiting staff, that if you copy the behavior of the customer...

00:36:46.160 --> 00:36:49.640
 So you give them the food as well.

00:36:49.640 --> 00:36:53.560
 You give them the food, and then you set opposite them, and just have the same thing.

00:36:53.560 --> 00:36:54.560
 Yeah.

00:36:54.560 --> 00:37:00.040
 Go up to them and give them your order, and then they'll go off and do it.

00:37:00.040 --> 00:37:01.800
 They'll just mimic what you would have been doing.

00:37:01.800 --> 00:37:02.800
 What do you mean?

00:37:02.800 --> 00:37:06.880
 The idea is that if you can relate to the customer more, you're more likely to get a

00:37:06.880 --> 00:37:08.520
 tip from them.

00:37:08.520 --> 00:37:13.480
 So they found that if you were the waiting staff and you went up to them and they made

00:37:13.480 --> 00:37:17.880
 the order, if you repeat the order back to them, that almost heightens the fact that you'll

00:37:17.880 --> 00:37:21.160
 get a tip because it makes them feel like you're friendly with them.

00:37:21.160 --> 00:37:24.640
 If you bend down next to them while they're giving you their order, that's been shown to

00:37:24.640 --> 00:37:27.200
 increase tip-inch as well.

00:37:27.200 --> 00:37:33.120
 When you say bend down next to them, you bend your knees and sort of get down to their level

00:37:33.120 --> 00:37:38.560
 and still look at them in the face, you don't turn around and you don't give your ass.

00:37:38.560 --> 00:37:40.040
 Yeah, don't Ace Ventura it.

00:37:40.040 --> 00:37:41.040
 Yeah.

00:37:41.040 --> 00:37:44.600
 I guess the reason that we sort of do this is because people like it, right?

00:37:44.600 --> 00:37:45.600
 And that's why you'll tip.

00:37:45.600 --> 00:37:49.080
 It's because you like it when your waiter mimics you in a way.

00:37:49.080 --> 00:37:54.680
 And I read a really interesting article saying copying might be what makes us human.

00:37:54.680 --> 00:37:56.520
 So we've actually evolved it.

00:37:56.520 --> 00:37:59.960
 So a lot of people say it's like innovation and ideas, right?

00:37:59.960 --> 00:38:04.040
 And we've invented so much stuff that other species haven't.

00:38:04.040 --> 00:38:08.400
 But they did this experiment that's really interesting where toddlers and chimps were

00:38:08.400 --> 00:38:13.000
 both shown a box with a treat inside it, like sweets or something.

00:38:13.000 --> 00:38:18.800
 And then the experimenter showed them how to open the box, but they added a irrelevant

00:38:18.800 --> 00:38:20.280
 motion during the opening.

00:38:20.280 --> 00:38:23.280
 So they tapped the box just before opening it.

00:38:23.280 --> 00:38:27.200
 And then they gave it to the child, the toddler or the chimp to see if they were able to open

00:38:27.200 --> 00:38:28.520
 the box.

00:38:28.520 --> 00:38:32.180
 And the chimps realized straight away that the tap was irrelevant.

00:38:32.180 --> 00:38:35.920
 So they copied all the other stuff that the human had done, worked out to open the box,

00:38:35.920 --> 00:38:37.440
 but could see that the tap was irrelevant.

00:38:37.440 --> 00:38:40.800
 Whereas the toddlers all still tapped the box.

00:38:40.800 --> 00:38:42.720
 And this is like over imitation.

00:38:42.720 --> 00:38:46.920
 It's like we imitate everything people do, even if it's totally useless.

00:38:46.920 --> 00:38:50.800
 And the idea is that this is how we've developed this amazing culture.

00:38:50.800 --> 00:38:55.000
 Because the only way that humans are so successful is that we've developed skills and technology

00:38:55.000 --> 00:38:56.000
 over generations.

00:38:56.000 --> 00:38:58.520
 Like no one can make a mobile phone from scratch.

00:38:58.520 --> 00:39:01.960
 No one really could work out the best way to build a canoe even.

00:39:01.960 --> 00:39:07.320
 So it's by copying bit by bit exactly what our ancestors have done or what our parents

00:39:07.320 --> 00:39:09.880
 are doing that makes us really successful.

00:39:09.880 --> 00:39:13.160
 But it does mean that we do point and a shit like tapping a box with the chip next to us

00:39:13.160 --> 00:39:15.340
 going, why are you doing that, mate?

00:39:15.340 --> 00:39:18.720
 Well, that's how we invented drumming as well.

00:39:18.720 --> 00:39:19.720
 Exactly.

00:39:19.720 --> 00:39:21.120
 Just tapping the box.

00:39:21.120 --> 00:39:26.640
 There is a thing where, like you say, it makes you feel better if people copy you.

00:39:26.640 --> 00:39:33.520
 But you kind of inherently know how much mimicry there should be depending on a situation.

00:39:33.520 --> 00:39:38.400
 And if there is too much or too little, this again, this is according to Dr. Charter and

00:39:38.400 --> 00:39:43.400
 in this podcast that I was listening to, she said that if there's too much or too little

00:39:43.400 --> 00:39:49.100
 mimicry, then it kind of hurts your self-control so you can't self-control as much.

00:39:49.100 --> 00:39:53.200
 You procrastinate more and you eat more junk food and have worse motor control.

00:39:53.200 --> 00:39:56.880
 So your reactions are even slightly worse as well.

00:39:56.880 --> 00:40:01.640
 And all these things can affect you from just someone mimicking you too much or not enough.

00:40:01.640 --> 00:40:04.680
 That's really passing the buck, passing the blame on, isn't it?

00:40:04.680 --> 00:40:08.320
 The only reason I had those 8,000 Big Macs or whatever it was, like carried up the stairs

00:40:08.320 --> 00:40:14.800
 is because you keep not copying it enough.

00:40:14.800 --> 00:40:22.300
 Okay, it's time for our final fact of the show and that is my fact.

00:40:22.300 --> 00:40:28.540
 My fact this week is that elephants can down 5 pints in under a second.

00:40:28.540 --> 00:40:33.300
 Wow, they wouldn't be allowed near that wine tap, would they?

00:40:33.300 --> 00:40:36.220
 That's the very definition of alcoholic and loud.

00:40:36.220 --> 00:40:41.620
 Oh my god, that Shang Dynasty lake would be drained.

00:40:41.620 --> 00:40:47.360
 Just to clarify very quickly, it is obviously the trunk is not the bit that they drink through.

00:40:47.360 --> 00:40:51.840
 The trunk is basically a storage unit, isn't it?

00:40:51.840 --> 00:40:55.840
 It's where they suck up and they can hold the content in and then they pass it through

00:40:55.840 --> 00:40:57.000
 to their mouth.

00:40:57.000 --> 00:41:00.640
 But recently there's new research which was published in the Journal of the Royal Society

00:41:00.640 --> 00:41:06.280
 Interface which found that when they suck up, either drink or when they're trying to

00:41:06.280 --> 00:41:15.900
 eat food, that the suction is so great that they can inhale air at 330 miles per hour.

00:41:15.900 --> 00:41:17.420
 That's ridiculous.

00:41:17.420 --> 00:41:22.340
 But I still think in a downing contest, I don't mean to quibble but that doesn't count.

00:41:22.340 --> 00:41:27.820
 This is like me taking part in a downing competition, pouring my 5 pints into a big bucket next

00:41:27.820 --> 00:41:31.220
 to me and going I win, oh yeah, I'm just going to drink them later.

00:41:31.220 --> 00:41:32.220
 No.

00:41:32.220 --> 00:41:38.080
 It's like you're taking 5 pints and snorting them up your nose and then dribbling it out

00:41:38.080 --> 00:41:44.420
 of your nose into your mouth later, which I must admit, I have seen you do that.

00:41:44.420 --> 00:41:45.420
 I really like it.

00:41:45.420 --> 00:41:47.620
 Did you say the Royal Society Interface then?

00:41:47.620 --> 00:41:48.620
 Yes.

00:41:48.620 --> 00:41:50.380
 Because it is literally about something going into a face.

00:41:50.380 --> 00:41:51.620
 Oh, it is.

00:41:51.620 --> 00:41:53.120
 It's very true.

00:41:53.120 --> 00:41:59.540
 Just to contextualize that speed, 330 miles per hour, that is faster than a Japanese bullet

00:41:59.540 --> 00:42:00.940
 train travels.

00:42:00.940 --> 00:42:02.380
 It's incredibly fast.

00:42:02.380 --> 00:42:05.780
 In the article, they say that it's 30 times faster than a human sneeze.

00:42:05.780 --> 00:42:09.420
 It's a picture because that feels like that's the speed of light when you do that.

00:42:09.420 --> 00:42:12.740
 It's 30 times that.

00:42:12.740 --> 00:42:20.220
 This speed of sucking water, I found is six times faster than the world's fastest waterslide.

00:42:20.220 --> 00:42:25.220
 And then I got right back onto waterslides again from the other week because the world

00:42:25.220 --> 00:42:30.740
 record fastest speed ever on a waterslide is 57 miles per hour.

00:42:30.740 --> 00:42:37.980
 And it was done in 2009 by a guy called Jens Scherer, who is a German advertising executive.

00:42:37.980 --> 00:42:41.340
 And according to this article in "Outside Magazine" and nowhere else on the internet

00:42:41.340 --> 00:42:46.860
 as far as I can find it, there's a thing in Germany called speed shooting where you have

00:42:46.860 --> 00:42:50.940
 to go down a watershoe as quickly as you possibly can.

00:42:50.940 --> 00:42:56.340
 And this journalist met up with Jens Scherer and tried to work out how to do it.

00:42:56.340 --> 00:43:01.300
 And apparently the trick is you isolate a couple of muscles in your stomach and you

00:43:01.300 --> 00:43:02.900
 really work on them.

00:43:02.900 --> 00:43:06.740
 And then you have to minimise the surface area of your skin on the watershoots.

00:43:06.740 --> 00:43:12.620
 So the way you do it is you have your shoulder blades on the shoot and just one heel that

00:43:12.620 --> 00:43:13.620
 goes on the shoot.

00:43:13.620 --> 00:43:17.740
 And there's only three points that are touching the watershoots and it makes you fly down

00:43:17.740 --> 00:43:19.860
 really, really, really fast.

00:43:19.860 --> 00:43:21.860
 You also have the cannonballs.

00:43:21.860 --> 00:43:28.180
 And these are the really fat shooters who, according to Scherer, have no technique, just

00:43:28.180 --> 00:43:29.180
 stomachs.

00:43:29.180 --> 00:43:31.500
 I know which method I prefer.

00:43:31.500 --> 00:43:34.980
 I'd rather overeat for a year and win that contest.

00:43:34.980 --> 00:43:38.740
 Well, you know, Scherer, he takes this really seriously.

00:43:38.740 --> 00:43:43.260
 He was very, very small speedos because he thinks that skin is the fastest way of doing

00:43:43.260 --> 00:43:44.940
 it, just human skin.

00:43:44.940 --> 00:43:46.140
 But he has tried other things.

00:43:46.140 --> 00:43:51.820
 He's tried covering himself in soap, in oil, in wax, in a special hydrophobic gel.

00:43:51.820 --> 00:43:54.020
 He covered himself in to see if he could go faster.

00:43:54.020 --> 00:44:00.340
 And he also used a type of cream used to tenderise the udders of dairy cows to make himself

00:44:00.340 --> 00:44:01.860
 go faster on watershoots.

00:44:01.860 --> 00:44:02.860
 But apparently...

00:44:02.860 --> 00:44:03.860
 Wait, hang on.

00:44:03.860 --> 00:44:04.860
 You said he was an advertising executive.

00:44:04.860 --> 00:44:07.900
 How has he got access to the cream that he used to lubricate the udders of dairy cows?

00:44:07.900 --> 00:44:09.340
 Well, where have you used advertising that?

00:44:09.340 --> 00:44:10.340
 I don't know.

00:44:10.340 --> 00:44:11.340
 Good point.

00:44:11.340 --> 00:44:12.340
 Yep.

00:44:12.340 --> 00:44:13.340
 Very good point.

00:44:13.340 --> 00:44:14.340
 Stacks up.

00:44:14.340 --> 00:44:20.420
 I always see big poster ad campaigns for cow udder lubrication cream.

00:44:20.420 --> 00:44:25.180
 I cannot believe you've used this Elephant Trunk fact as an excuse to use all your unused

00:44:25.180 --> 00:44:26.180
 research from last week.

00:44:26.180 --> 00:44:27.180
 I know.

00:44:27.180 --> 00:44:29.380
 You've just sort of stuck a time tunnel three weeks back into the past.

00:44:29.380 --> 00:44:32.100
 I promise you, I found this all brand new stuff this week.

00:44:32.100 --> 00:44:35.500
 I was absolutely devastated I didn't find it three weeks ago.

00:44:35.500 --> 00:44:39.340
 I do think that a waterslide that was called the Elephant's Trunk that involved firing

00:44:39.340 --> 00:44:44.980
 you up a slide incredibly fast is a good idea if anyone is out there wanting to...

00:44:44.980 --> 00:44:46.180
 A reverse waterslide?

00:44:46.180 --> 00:44:47.180
 Yeah.

00:44:47.180 --> 00:44:48.180
 Firing it, yeah.

00:44:48.180 --> 00:44:49.180
 But is there blow?

00:44:49.180 --> 00:44:50.180
 Do you think it sucks up it?

00:44:50.180 --> 00:44:51.180
 Oh, yeah.

00:44:51.180 --> 00:44:52.180
 Nice.

00:44:52.180 --> 00:44:54.740
 So, do you start in the pool?

00:44:54.740 --> 00:44:58.660
 Everyone's in the pool and you don't know one random person every minute is going to

00:44:58.660 --> 00:45:01.460
 get sucked back up the tube to the very top.

00:45:01.460 --> 00:45:02.460
 Yeah.

00:45:02.460 --> 00:45:03.460
 And you don't know who it's going to be.

00:45:03.460 --> 00:45:04.460
 That's stressful.

00:45:04.460 --> 00:45:05.900
 And then do you have to walk down?

00:45:05.900 --> 00:45:06.900
 Yes.

00:45:06.900 --> 00:45:12.980
 You have to queue down the steps for ages at the end.

00:45:12.980 --> 00:45:21.260
 So, one thing elephants do with their trunks is to touch each other's genitals to comfort

00:45:21.260 --> 00:45:22.500
 each other.

00:45:22.500 --> 00:45:30.500
 If one of their friends is distressed, they will just kind of cop a feel or the alternative

00:45:30.500 --> 00:45:34.940
 thing they do is to put their trunk in their friend's mouth to sort of stick it in there.

00:45:34.940 --> 00:45:36.900
 And that's another way of calming them down.

00:45:36.900 --> 00:45:37.900
 Yeah.

00:45:37.900 --> 00:45:38.900
 We should start trying that.

00:45:38.900 --> 00:45:43.420
 We used to carry that feather, wasn't it, to tickle the genitals of his friends?

00:45:43.420 --> 00:45:44.420
 You can't be unhappy when you're laughing.

00:45:44.420 --> 00:45:50.060
 Apparently, they also use it to pinch their parents' genitals sometimes to get their attention.

00:45:50.060 --> 00:45:55.580
 I read somewhere there's an archive of African elephants' trunk uses and there are more than

00:45:55.580 --> 00:45:58.420
 250 separate uses for their trunks.

00:45:58.420 --> 00:45:59.420
 No.

00:45:59.420 --> 00:46:02.900
 Which sounds like one of those, you know, difficult interview questions.

00:46:02.900 --> 00:46:05.140
 How many uses can you think of for a trunk?

00:46:05.140 --> 00:46:09.580
 But one of them was named as kids getting their mum's attention by pinching her genitals.

00:46:09.580 --> 00:46:10.580
 Or dad.

00:46:10.580 --> 00:46:11.580
 Wow.

00:46:11.580 --> 00:46:12.580
 Wow.

00:46:12.580 --> 00:46:13.580
 Do you know how you take an elephant's temperature?

00:46:13.580 --> 00:46:15.900
 Sounds like the start of a joke.

00:46:15.900 --> 00:46:16.900
 Yeah.

00:46:16.900 --> 00:46:17.900
 The bum-bum.

00:46:17.900 --> 00:46:20.580
 Tickle its genitals.

00:46:20.580 --> 00:46:27.300
 So it is a thermometer and it is up the bum, but weirdly, the thermometer is a normal sized

00:46:27.300 --> 00:46:28.300
 one.

00:46:28.300 --> 00:46:29.300
 Oh.

00:46:29.300 --> 00:46:32.020
 Because you'd think it would be a comical oversized elephant one.

00:46:32.020 --> 00:46:34.420
 You'd think it wouldn't touch the sides, would you?

00:46:34.420 --> 00:46:35.420
 Yeah.

00:46:35.420 --> 00:46:36.420
 Exactly.

00:46:36.420 --> 00:46:41.780
 But you've got to keep your arm there for four minutes and it could be really important

00:46:41.780 --> 00:46:43.140
 to assess the elephant's health as well.

00:46:43.140 --> 00:46:44.140
 Right.

00:46:44.140 --> 00:46:45.140
 But that's a long time.

00:46:45.140 --> 00:46:46.140
 Yeah.

00:46:46.140 --> 00:46:49.140
 Have we then been using unnecessarily large thermometers?

00:46:49.140 --> 00:46:52.500
 That's a great point.

00:46:52.500 --> 00:46:56.540
 That does imply that humans should be able to use one the size of a blade of grass.

00:46:56.540 --> 00:46:57.540
 Yeah.

00:46:57.540 --> 00:46:58.540
 You're absolutely right.

00:46:58.540 --> 00:46:59.540
 It does.

00:46:59.540 --> 00:47:00.540
 It doesn't matter.

00:47:00.540 --> 00:47:04.860
 Elephant no such thing as a fish podcast where they're going, "Do you know humans use thermometers

00:47:04.860 --> 00:47:06.340
 the same size as us?"

00:47:06.340 --> 00:47:07.340
 It's not that.

00:47:07.340 --> 00:47:09.860
 Because you'd think they'd be the size of a little drawing fin.

00:47:09.860 --> 00:47:14.980
 It would be the equivalent of me shoving a telegraph pole up my arse.

00:47:14.980 --> 00:47:20.420
 But people have been studying this since 1936.

00:47:20.420 --> 00:47:24.220
 I found a scientific paper on elephant body temperatures which said the method used in

00:47:24.220 --> 00:47:28.580
 India is to have a Mahut, an elephant keeper, holding a thermometer in his hand, insert

00:47:28.580 --> 00:47:33.420
 his well-lubricated arm into the capacious rectum after first removing several of the

00:47:33.420 --> 00:47:35.300
 huge balls of feces.

00:47:35.300 --> 00:47:39.220
 I think, by the way, if we call out James for having used waterslide material, we have

00:47:39.220 --> 00:47:45.820
 to call Andy up for using thermometric material about six weeks ago.

00:47:45.820 --> 00:47:50.140
 Female Asian elephants have exactly the same sex pheromones as moths.

00:47:50.140 --> 00:47:52.460
 Do they ever get confused?

00:47:52.460 --> 00:47:55.100
 That must mean there's some very confusing couplings.

00:47:55.100 --> 00:47:56.100
 Yeah.

00:47:56.100 --> 00:47:57.100
 You wouldn't think so, right?

00:47:57.100 --> 00:48:05.260
 It would be a surprisingly heavy knock at the door, the moth looks up.

00:48:05.260 --> 00:48:08.220
 The other way round, I guess, right?

00:48:08.220 --> 00:48:10.820
 This is in a brilliant book by Tristan Wyatt.

00:48:10.820 --> 00:48:15.180
 He actually says in his book, "Apart from the mating difficulties should they try, male

00:48:15.180 --> 00:48:19.180
 moths are unlikely to be attracted to female elephants."

00:48:19.180 --> 00:48:23.660
 The reason being that actually a moth pheromone is usually a couple of different pheromones

00:48:23.660 --> 00:48:26.700
 together, one of which is this elephant pheromone.

00:48:26.700 --> 00:48:29.500
 But without the secondary pheromone, you're probably not.

00:48:29.500 --> 00:48:34.100
 You're going to think that the elephant is a bit like a sexy moth, but not exactly like

00:48:34.100 --> 00:48:35.500
 a sexy moth.

00:48:35.500 --> 00:48:40.300
 Is that the only thing that's holding them back?

00:48:40.300 --> 00:48:43.620
 If they're that stupid, they would genuinely get confused.

00:48:43.620 --> 00:48:48.940
 Well, I'm just thinking, if a normal tiny thermometer works in an elephant's anus, there

00:48:48.940 --> 00:48:53.540
 may be a moth penis works in an elephant vagina.

00:48:53.540 --> 00:48:57.780
 It's the ultimate, you don't look like your Tinder profile picture.

00:48:57.780 --> 00:49:00.740
 God, imagine the crossbreed.

00:49:00.740 --> 00:49:05.480
 So these elephants can down five pints in under a second.

00:49:05.480 --> 00:49:11.180
 What do you think is the fastest time that a human can down a pint of liquid?

00:49:11.180 --> 00:49:14.280
 A pint of liquid.

00:49:14.280 --> 00:49:16.980
 I mean, you see these people drinking a pint, don't you, where they just open their throat

00:49:16.980 --> 00:49:17.980
 and it just goes.

00:49:17.980 --> 00:49:18.980
 Five seconds, I would say.

00:49:18.980 --> 00:49:19.980
 Five seconds is done.

00:49:19.980 --> 00:49:20.980
 You've seen me.

00:49:20.980 --> 00:49:24.700
 You've seen me do it in less than that.

00:49:24.700 --> 00:49:27.740
 One, one, one second, one point, two seconds.

00:49:27.740 --> 00:49:32.260
 Five seconds is like average first point drinking time.

00:49:32.260 --> 00:49:33.260
 Last order's at the bar.

00:49:33.260 --> 00:49:34.260
 Last order.

00:49:34.260 --> 00:49:35.260
 Oh, another one.

00:49:35.260 --> 00:49:38.220
 I'll say two seconds.

00:49:38.220 --> 00:49:40.580
 Well, yeah, it's in between those two.

00:49:40.580 --> 00:49:43.220
 It's 1.75 seconds.

00:49:43.220 --> 00:49:49.780
 And this was achieved by Tim Cocker, who was a DJ for XFM and is now a DJ for Virgin Radio.

00:49:49.780 --> 00:49:55.820
 And I spoke to Mr. Cocker about this and asked him a few questions about his amazing skill

00:49:55.820 --> 00:49:59.180
 at being able to down drinks.

00:49:59.180 --> 00:50:04.820
 So he reckons it was 1.75 seconds and it was done on this breakfast show that he was presenting.

00:50:04.820 --> 00:50:09.540
 But the time began from when he picked up the glass and it stopped when he put the glass

00:50:09.540 --> 00:50:10.540
 down.

00:50:10.540 --> 00:50:12.180
 So actually he did it much quicker than that.

00:50:12.180 --> 00:50:15.780
 So Anna's 1.2 second or one second might be quite close, I think.

00:50:15.780 --> 00:50:17.900
 And I asked him how he discovered the skill.

00:50:17.900 --> 00:50:22.900
 He said it was during a drinking game at Exeter University when he was just doing that and

00:50:22.900 --> 00:50:26.260
 suddenly everyone turned around and went, "What the hell has just happened over there?"

00:50:26.260 --> 00:50:31.540
 But he could literally, if he was on a night out, walk through a bar, pass a table and

00:50:31.540 --> 00:50:35.620
 say to someone with a full pint, "Hey, what an amazing painting on the wall."

00:50:35.620 --> 00:50:40.260
 They'd turn around for two seconds, turn back, and there's just an empty pint glass

00:50:40.260 --> 00:50:41.820
 and he walks to the next table.

00:50:41.820 --> 00:50:44.540
 He said, "Oh, England have just kicked a goal."

00:50:44.540 --> 00:50:45.540
 They turn.

00:50:45.540 --> 00:50:46.540
 Boom.

00:50:46.540 --> 00:50:50.300
 They have a whole night in 30 seconds.

00:50:50.300 --> 00:50:54.300
 What pubs are you going to where you say, "That's a nice painting on the wall for clubs?"

00:50:54.300 --> 00:50:56.340
 Well, here's an interesting thing.

00:50:56.340 --> 00:51:00.740
 The study that I was talking about for this fact, when they were looking into elephants

00:51:00.740 --> 00:51:06.980
 sucking in all of this liquid into their trunk in such speeds, they found that more liquid

00:51:06.980 --> 00:51:13.020
 was going into the trunk than was available in terms of space that the trunk had.

00:51:13.020 --> 00:51:14.020
 Just way more liquid.

00:51:14.020 --> 00:51:15.540
 And they're going, "What's going on there?"

00:51:15.540 --> 00:51:20.860
 So they did an ultrasound on an elephant as it was drinking the liquid and they found

00:51:20.860 --> 00:51:27.180
 that the elephant was dilating the nostrils inside the trunk and they were expanding it

00:51:27.180 --> 00:51:30.420
 to a total volume of up to 64%.

00:51:30.420 --> 00:51:32.500
 So its trunk gets bigger as it drinks.

00:51:32.500 --> 00:51:33.500
 Exactly.

00:51:33.500 --> 00:51:41.340
 And I'm wondering if your buddy there is expanding his throat to a much larger size to allow for

00:51:41.340 --> 00:51:45.860
 it to just go down like pouring a pint into a well basically.

00:51:45.860 --> 00:51:46.860
 Maybe.

00:51:46.860 --> 00:51:47.860
 Yeah.

00:51:47.860 --> 00:51:48.860
 Maybe.

00:51:48.860 --> 00:51:50.820
 Do you think it looks like a giant Adam's apple just sort of appears and then disappears

00:51:50.820 --> 00:51:52.420
 and they're doing it then?

00:51:52.420 --> 00:51:57.260
 He's not a cartoon character guys, he's a suspected DJ.

00:51:57.260 --> 00:52:02.180
 I have another food record or two or consumption, rate of consumption record.

00:52:02.180 --> 00:52:09.100
 There was a story that broke quite recently and it was that during lockdown a man called

00:52:09.100 --> 00:52:13.300
 Declan Evans from Lincoln broke the world record for the fastest time to drink a Capri

00:52:13.300 --> 00:52:14.300
 Sun.

00:52:14.300 --> 00:52:21.660
 Now they're probably only around 250 milliliters or 3 milliliters or something like that.

00:52:21.660 --> 00:52:22.820
 So half the size I reckon.

00:52:22.820 --> 00:52:23.820
 Yeah.

00:52:23.820 --> 00:52:25.420
 And you're drinking through a straw, aren't you, as well?

00:52:25.420 --> 00:52:26.820
 Well, this is the problem.

00:52:26.820 --> 00:52:28.660
 The rules are very stringent.

00:52:28.660 --> 00:52:32.380
 You need to drink an unmodified 200 mil Capri Sun pouch.

00:52:32.380 --> 00:52:37.780
 The straw still has to be not only stuck to the side but also still in the plastic.

00:52:37.780 --> 00:52:42.540
 So it's actually, the record for drinking a Capri Sun is much longer than the record

00:52:42.540 --> 00:52:43.540
 for drinking a pint.

00:52:43.540 --> 00:52:46.020
 It's like by an order of 10.

00:52:46.020 --> 00:52:47.020
 Wow.

00:52:47.020 --> 00:52:48.020
 By an order of magnitude.

00:52:48.020 --> 00:52:49.020
 Yeah.

00:52:49.020 --> 00:52:50.020
 So the rules.

00:52:50.020 --> 00:52:52.380
 More than 10 seconds, really?

00:52:52.380 --> 00:52:53.380
 Yeah.

00:52:53.380 --> 00:52:54.380
 So he broke it.

00:52:54.380 --> 00:52:59.060
 It actually got re-broken within a month by a lady called Leah Schuttkiver who managed

00:52:59.060 --> 00:53:01.220
 it in 15.71 seconds.

00:53:01.220 --> 00:53:03.140
 That I believe is the current world record.

00:53:03.140 --> 00:53:04.140
 Really?

00:53:04.140 --> 00:53:05.140
 The rules are so strict though.

00:53:05.140 --> 00:53:06.140
 Listen to this.

00:53:06.140 --> 00:53:10.460
 The two and a half millilitres may still be found in the pouch after it is normally drunk.

00:53:10.460 --> 00:53:16.100
 Once the attempt has ended, the contents of the pouch must be poured into a 2.5 mil measuring

00:53:16.100 --> 00:53:18.180
 spoon and you're filming all of this.

00:53:18.180 --> 00:53:21.220
 If any liquid overflows, the attempt will be disqualified.

00:53:21.220 --> 00:53:22.220
 Yeah.

00:53:22.220 --> 00:53:23.220
 That's...

00:53:23.220 --> 00:53:24.220
 It's strict.

00:53:24.220 --> 00:53:25.220
 That's very strict.

00:53:25.220 --> 00:53:28.260
 How crazy that the rules are more strict than posting an eagle to the National Eagle

00:53:28.260 --> 00:53:46.220
 for a positive treatment.

00:53:46.220 --> 00:53:48.460
 I'm on that Shriverland, Andy.

00:53:48.460 --> 00:53:49.460
 At Andrew Hunter M.

00:53:49.460 --> 00:53:50.460
 James.

00:53:50.460 --> 00:53:51.460
 At James Harkin.

00:53:51.460 --> 00:53:52.460
 And Anna.

00:53:52.460 --> 00:53:53.860

00:53:53.860 --> 00:53:54.860
 Yep.

00:53:54.860 --> 00:53:58.260
 You can go to our group account at no such thing or go to our website.

00:53:58.260 --> 00:54:00.380
 No such thing as a fish.com.

00:54:00.380 --> 00:54:02.420
 It is booming on there at the moment.

00:54:02.420 --> 00:54:03.980
 All of our previous episodes were up there.

00:54:03.980 --> 00:54:06.700
 We've got a massive tour coming up later this year.

00:54:06.700 --> 00:54:07.700
 Check them out.

00:54:07.700 --> 00:54:08.700
 See if we're coming to your town.

00:54:08.700 --> 00:54:09.700
 Do come along.

00:54:09.700 --> 00:54:12.140
 We have an amazing time on tour and we'd love to see you there.

00:54:12.140 --> 00:54:14.260
 We also have a link to our merch.

00:54:14.260 --> 00:54:15.460
 There's all the stuff you need from us.

00:54:15.460 --> 00:54:16.940
 You can even see our faces there.

00:54:16.940 --> 00:54:17.940
 Check them out.

00:54:17.940 --> 00:54:18.940
 They look nice.

00:54:18.940 --> 00:54:19.940
 Okay.

00:54:19.940 --> 00:54:21.260
 We'll be back again next week with another episode.

00:54:21.260 --> 00:54:22.260
 We'll see you then.

00:54:22.260 --> 00:54:22.780
