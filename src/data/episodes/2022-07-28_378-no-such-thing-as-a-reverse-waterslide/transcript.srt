 Hello, and welcome to another episode of No Such Thing as a Fish, a weekly podcast coming

3
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:24,200
 to you from four undisclosed locations in the UK.

4
00:00:24,200 --> 00:00:28,840
 My name is Dan Schreiber, I am sitting here with Anna Tyshinski, Andrew Hunter Murray,

5
00:00:28,840 --> 00:00:32,680
 and James Harkin, and once again, we have gathered round the microphones with our four

6
00:00:32,680 --> 00:00:38,960
 favourite facts from the last seven days, and in no particular order, here we go.

7
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:41,600
 Starting with fact number one, and that is James.

8
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:48,240
 Okay, my fact this week is that some dog owners in Alaska are putting spiky jackets on their

9
00:00:48,240 --> 00:00:54,120
 pets to stop bald eagles from carrying them away.

10
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:58,200
 How many pets in Alaska have been carried off by bald eagles?

11
00:00:58,200 --> 00:01:03,440
 To my knowledge, in recent weeks, zero, but that just shows that these jackets are doing

12
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:04,440
 their job, right?

13
00:01:04,440 --> 00:01:06,880
 That's a good point, yeah.

14
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:09,480
 It's so cool, have you guys seen a picture of it?

15
00:01:09,480 --> 00:01:16,840
 They look like futuristic ravers, like an apocalyptic punk, it's amazing, it's like huge glow sticks

16
00:01:16,840 --> 00:01:21,000
 on the back with their spikes multi-coloured and so on.

17
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,440
 Because I read a few things saying, I can't look out whether the guys selling this stuff

18
00:01:24,440 --> 00:01:29,960
 are just on a genius streak of manipulating dog owners paranoia, because there are lots

19
00:01:29,960 --> 00:01:32,640
 of eagles and they do carry off very heavy fish.

20
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:38,280
 Well, okay, so there are a lot more bald eagles recently than there have been over the recent

21
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:40,040
 history, that is for sure.

22
00:01:40,040 --> 00:01:49,360
 There were about 72,000 in the US in 2009 and in 2019 there were 316,000 and that's to say

23
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:52,960
 nothing of the ones that are in Canada, which is plenty as well.

24
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:58,120
 So that's good news for eagles, but it might be bad news for dogs because there are anecdotal

25
00:01:58,120 --> 00:02:03,640
 stories of eagles coming down and picking up dogs and so they come up with these new

26
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:04,640
 products.

27
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:11,000
 There's a company, they've got a website called coyotevest.com and they've taken their existing

28
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:16,680
 waistcoats that they sell to dog owners and they've put, like Dan says, these kind of

29
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:21,680
 almost like kaplunk sticks, if you can imagine what they look like on the back of them and

30
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:26,760
 then there's another product called hawk shield which has velcro on it so that when the hawk

31
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:31,640
 or the eagle comes down, it only picks up the vest and it doesn't pick up the dog a

32
00:02:31,640 --> 00:02:36,480
 bit like, you know, if you have a lizard and someone tries to catch the lizard but it loses

33
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:37,480
 its tail.

34
00:02:37,480 --> 00:02:38,480
 Yeah.

35
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:41,880
 It's weak velcro then, because that sounds like it's going to come undone all the time.

36
00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:43,440
 That sounds really annoying.

37
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:48,420
 I thought you were going to say that the eagle sticks to the velcro when it lands, that you

38
00:02:48,420 --> 00:02:50,880
 get the velcro that just glues it to the dog.

39
00:02:50,880 --> 00:02:54,160
 When your dog comes back and it's just got 20 eagles attached to it.

40
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:57,160
 Guys, it doesn't matter what they can do, they're not doing it.

41
00:02:57,160 --> 00:02:58,160
 What?

42
00:02:58,160 --> 00:03:02,240
 Why is everyone speculating about how they're not blimmin' doing it?

43
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:07,120
 One tiny little Pomeranian was sadly killed by one in 2020, not even carried off, just

44
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:08,120
 killed.

45
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:10,120
 One too many Anna.

46
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:11,120
 What?

47
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:13,040
 It's not worth the huge industry.

48
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:19,160
 The only other evidence I could find of any pet attacks was in 2008, a guy called David

49
00:03:19,160 --> 00:03:24,560
 Hunsaker in Alaska said he had a bald eagle nest outside his house in his garden and at

50
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:29,800
 one point he found a cat collar in there, which implies, I suppose, that the eagles

51
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:31,920
 eaten the cat and left the collar.

52
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:32,920
 Okay.

53
00:03:32,920 --> 00:03:37,680
 How do you explain the fact that two weeks ago I met a man who was taken by an eagle when

54
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:38,680
 he was a child?

55
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:42,160
 Do you really want to know how he explained that, Dan?

56
00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:43,160
 It's true.

57
00:03:43,160 --> 00:03:48,760
 I met a guy who came, a builder who came to our house, he's from Kazakhstan and he told

58
00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:52,640
 my wife that when he was a child he was in a field and the eagle picked him up and carried

59
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:57,280
 him away and his mother had to run after it and beat it with a stick so he could be dropped,

60
00:03:57,280 --> 00:03:58,280
 which it did.

61
00:03:58,280 --> 00:03:59,280
 How do you explain that?

62
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:03,840
 Did he use that as the reason why he left halfway through the day and didn't come back?

63
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:05,600
 Sorry, another bloody eagle.

64
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:09,840
 I'm not questioning his veracity but I, when I worked in the Scottish Parliament, used

65
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:13,240
 to have a couple of constituents who were incessantly complaining their sheep were being

66
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:20,160
 carried off by sea eagles and I would lump them in the same box as your Kazakhstani builder,

67
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:24,720
 which is a box of people who have hallucinations of eagles carrying things away.

68
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:29,480
 Listen, there was a story in Scotland in 2019 and this might be the one that you're talking

69
00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:33,920
 about Anna, where sea eagles were blamed for stealing lambs and this farmers, they took

70
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:37,400
 it really seriously and they were trying to work out how to prevent it.

71
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:41,680
 They were putting up helium balloons to sort of float above where the sheep were, the lamb

72
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:43,280
 were, to sort of scare them away.

73
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:47,080
 Just make it look like a birthday party for the eagles when they're tucking into their

74
00:04:47,080 --> 00:04:48,080
 lovely fresh lambs.

75
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:49,080
 That's true.

76
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:50,080
 It didn't work out though.

77
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:53,120
 They said we're struggling a bit with these because they're not staying in the air.

78
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:55,800
 So a bit of a flaw with the old balloon technology there.

79
00:04:55,800 --> 00:05:00,320
 All that amazes me about that is that I guarantee you it's going to be the same farmer I used

80
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:06,680
 to talk to in time, is that he's still banging away at the same nonsense drum 14 years later.

81
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:07,680
 Wow.

82
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:11,600
 Maybe if you've done something 14 years ago Anna, we wouldn't still have this problem.

83
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:15,320
 It's actually why I'm not still in the job, they find me.

84
00:05:15,320 --> 00:05:18,840
 They've got very bad branding, bald eagles.

85
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:20,920
 I feel so sorry for them.

86
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:22,240
 Why are they called bald?

87
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:26,320
 Bald is not what you want to be as an eagle and indeed they're not bald.

88
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:27,640
 And I actually, I never really thought about it.

89
00:05:27,640 --> 00:05:31,720
 I always thought maybe bald eagles were hiding a bald patch that I just had never spotted,

90
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:35,360
 but it just comes from an old English word for white, like shining white.

91
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:38,800
 Oh, it's going to have white heads today.

92
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:44,080
 I always thought it was because the white head made them look bald, but it's not.

93
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:48,840
 That makes sense, but I guess bald will come from the same word, I guess, like clean white.

94
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:49,840
 Yeah.

95
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:53,760
 I think pie bald, a horse that's pie bald is two different colors, and I think the

96
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:56,400
 bald bit of that means white headed.

97
00:05:56,400 --> 00:06:01,400
 So in the USA, it is also very illegal to own an eagle.

98
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:02,840
 You can remember it because it rhymes.

99
00:06:02,840 --> 00:06:03,840
 It's very handy.

100
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:06,600
 Is it illegal to own a beagle though, Andy?

101
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:07,600
 No.

102
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:11,080
 So how are you supposed to remember it?

103
00:06:11,080 --> 00:06:17,200
 A bald eagle, the national bird of America, you're not allowed to own at all.

104
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:21,040
 And if you find a dead one, you're not allowed to keep it.

105
00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:22,320
 Why would you want to?

106
00:06:22,320 --> 00:06:29,760
 But there is a US facility called the National Eagle Repository, which effectively is a massive

107
00:06:29,760 --> 00:06:35,040
 fridge full of dead eagles and eagle body parts, because they're used by indigenous Americans

108
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:38,760
 for religious purposes and ceremonies.

109
00:06:38,760 --> 00:06:45,000
 So this National Eagle Repository receives 30 to 40 eagle carcasses every single day

110
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,200
 they're coming in the door.

111
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:48,200
 Yeah.

112
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:49,600
 And it's in a suburb of Denver.

113
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:52,920
 I mean, it's nowhere very glamorous or weird, it's just in Denver.

114
00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:56,920
 You wouldn't put it, you know, in Manhattan, which I don't think you'd be putting there.

115
00:06:56,920 --> 00:06:57,920
 No, right.

116
00:06:57,920 --> 00:06:58,920
 Or Broadway.

117
00:06:58,920 --> 00:07:01,880
 And the rental cost would be too high for your enormous eagle fridge.

118
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:06,200
 But yeah, so you can't, when you say no one can, you can own an eagle if you belong to

119
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:11,880
 one of the, I think it's like 573 recognized tribes who use those eagles in their ceremonies.

120
00:07:11,880 --> 00:07:12,880
 Exactly.

121
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:17,720
 You can apply either for a full eagle or for effectively a franken eagle, you can apply

122
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:21,560
 to get the constituent parts of an eagle if they have an eagle which has an eye missing

123
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:23,120
 or a wing missing or a tail or whatever.

124
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:27,240
 Well, they'll give you an eye from a different eagle and stick it into your eagle, will they?

125
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:31,720
 And I think they will, they will send you an eagle kit.

126
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:32,720
 What?

127
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:35,720
 It's not, it's not build your own eagle.

128
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:41,440
 No, no, no, it's things like burning the feathers during ceremonies, yeah, it's, it is for proper

129
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:42,440
 rituals.

130
00:07:42,440 --> 00:07:43,440
 Yeah.

131
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:46,520
 But if you find an eagle, you're encouraged to post it, you're literally encouraged to

132
00:07:46,520 --> 00:07:48,820
 go to the post office and send it to them.

133
00:07:48,820 --> 00:07:50,880
 This is just as a random person.

134
00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:54,200
 And there's instructions on their website where they say, you know, if you're going

135
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:58,360
 to do it, select a very sturdy cardboard box.

136
00:07:58,360 --> 00:08:03,920
 Don't pack too many eagles in, you know, don't bend them and make them a bit out of shape.

137
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:06,000
 You've got to send them in a frozen state.

138
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:09,800
 And I'm not sure how you do that because they say don't include gel or ice packs.

139
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:14,840
 But if you send them inside a ice cooler, they will send that back to you.

140
00:08:14,840 --> 00:08:18,000
 So it's sort of like, don't worry, you will get your ice cooler back.

141
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,840
 You've got to double bag them.

142
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:23,880
 You know, there's all these rules and you've got to, you've got to ship them via FedEx

143
00:08:23,880 --> 00:08:26,440
 on any non-holidays that are Monday, Tuesdays or Wednesdays.

144
00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:31,040
 A paw in turn who's opening the post in that place every single day.

145
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:32,040
 Just one is it.

146
00:08:32,040 --> 00:08:35,840
 Oh, it's another rotten, maggoty eagle.

147
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:41,560
 Have you guys heard of wounded in winter beautiful bald eagle, speaking of Native Americans?

148
00:08:41,560 --> 00:08:42,560
 No.

149
00:08:42,560 --> 00:08:43,560
 Is that a person?

150
00:08:43,560 --> 00:08:44,560
 Or is that a...

151
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:45,560
 It's a person.

152
00:08:45,560 --> 00:08:48,320
 His name is also David Bald Eagle for short.

153
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:49,320
 Nice.

154
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:54,040
 So if you're called David, then it does seem like you can use the words wounded in winter

155
00:08:54,040 --> 00:08:56,640
 beautiful instead of David.

156
00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:59,800
 But David Bald Eagle was an actor.

157
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:03,600
 He was in dances with wolves as well as a lot of other things.

158
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:05,240
 But he had an amazing life.

159
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:07,440
 He was in the Second World War.

160
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:13,800
 He was dropped into Italy and it's a group of soldiers who fought so fiercely.

161
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:17,640
 The Germans called them the devils in baggy pants.

162
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:21,360
 And then after fighting there, they took him out again and he was dropped over Normandy

163
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:23,680
 during the Normandy landings.

164
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:28,120
 But he was accidentally dropped in the wrong place directly over German troops, which meant

165
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:33,360
 they could literally just look up and shoot at these guys who were landing on them.

166
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:36,400
 He said that we were like clay pigeons coming down.

167
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:38,280
 Most of my outfit was wiped out.

168
00:09:38,280 --> 00:09:40,360
 He said as he came down.

169
00:09:40,360 --> 00:09:44,160
 So ironic that the bald eagle ended up being like a clay pigeon.

170
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:46,040
 Yes, exactly.

171
00:09:46,040 --> 00:09:47,040
 The medics came.

172
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:48,040
 They left him for dead.

173
00:09:48,040 --> 00:09:51,600
 But then some British soldiers, commandos, came in afterwards and realised that he was

174
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:53,840
 still alive and managed to save his life.

175
00:09:53,840 --> 00:09:59,040
 And then he later became a competitive ballroom dancer, a pro baseball player.

176
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:03,160
 And then he became an actor and also danced with Marilyn Monroe.

177
00:10:03,160 --> 00:10:04,960
 Imagine that for a life.

178
00:10:04,960 --> 00:10:05,960
 Wow.

179
00:10:05,960 --> 00:10:06,960
 That was an extraordinary CV.

180
00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:12,200
 It actually, it's hard to know what job to apply for with that kind of image.

181
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:15,240
 You know the bird we started talking about here.

182
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:16,240
 What kind of eagle is that?

183
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:17,240
 Oh, the bald eagle.

184
00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:18,400
 The American bald eagle.

185
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:24,680
 They really interestingly sound nothing like we have all been conditioned to think they

186
00:10:24,680 --> 00:10:25,680
 sound.

187
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:32,080
 So if you picture the American desert and someone riding a horse through a canyon and he looks

188
00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:36,120
 up and there's an eagle above and it makes this amazing 'ya' cry, right?

189
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:37,120
 That was a very bad impression of it.

190
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:38,120
 Try a better one.

191
00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:39,120
 Try a better one.

192
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:40,120
 Yeah.

193
00:10:40,120 --> 00:10:41,120
 That one.

194
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:42,120
 That was really good.

195
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:43,120
 Not to make it as bit flimmy.

196
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:44,120
 Bit well.

197
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:46,120
 Okay, look.

198
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:50,240
 Anyway, they don't sound like that at all.

199
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:54,040
 They make these pathetic little cheaps and they have to get the sound of a red tailed

200
00:10:54,040 --> 00:10:59,560
 hawk dubbed over in movies to make everyone think that they sound magnificent and mighty.

201
00:10:59,560 --> 00:11:00,560
 They don't at all.

202
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:03,880
 Well, they used to get the sound of a red tailed hawk, but now I imagine you'll be employed

203
00:11:03,880 --> 00:11:06,880
 for the job.

204
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:12,680
 Okay, so do you know how bald eagles have sex when you got to that part of the podcast

205
00:11:12,680 --> 00:11:13,680
 already?

206
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:16,600
 It took longer than I expected.

207
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:17,600
 Is it mid-flight?

208
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:23,360
 Yeah, certainly the courting is all mid-flight and that's kind of the interesting part of

209
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:24,360
 it.

210
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:27,960
 So you'll get two bald eagles, a male and a female, and they'll fly really, really high

211
00:11:27,960 --> 00:11:33,040
 up together and then they'll lock their talons together and they'll go into kind of a cartwheel

212
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:34,760
 death spin.

213
00:11:34,760 --> 00:11:41,160
 If you imagine like a helicopter where the blades have all gone crazy and all the drivers

214
00:11:41,160 --> 00:11:46,120
 stopped being able to control it and it goes into a spin, they come right down to the floor

215
00:11:46,120 --> 00:11:51,360
 and they break it apart at the last minute and that is kind of the courting technique,

216
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:54,760
 although sometimes it has to be said they do actually hit the ground.

217
00:11:54,760 --> 00:11:55,760
 Oh.

218
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:58,880
 Well, that's what makes it sexy, the risk.

219
00:11:58,880 --> 00:11:59,880
 It's the risk.

220
00:11:59,880 --> 00:12:02,000
 It's like a fistywank, isn't it?

221
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,000
 It's a sort of...

222
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,000
 A fistywank.

223
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:07,000
 That's not what you want to say.

224
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,000
 That's not a fisty.

225
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,000
 That's not what you want to say.

226
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,000
 There's our title for this week's episode.

227
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,000
 No such thing as a fistywank.

228
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:15,880
 I think you might be grappling for a spikywank.

229
00:12:15,880 --> 00:12:18,080
 A fistywank is just a normal wank, isn't it?

230
00:12:18,080 --> 00:12:23,200
 There was a lot of grappling going on, that's for sure.

231
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:24,320
 But is it in the danger?

232
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:28,560
 Is that the idea that as they're tumbling down, they're like, we've got three seconds

233
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:29,880
 to live, quick.

234
00:12:29,880 --> 00:12:33,640
 I think if you were to anthropomorphise these eagles, then that's what you would think,

235
00:12:33,640 --> 00:12:34,640
 for sure.

236
00:12:34,640 --> 00:12:38,480
 It's like, you know, if you can afford to do such a dangerous thing, then it might mean

237
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:39,480
 you're a good mate.

238
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:43,120
 God, I can't wait to hear the David Attenborough commentary on this.

239
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:46,960
 And so, like on a fistywank.

240
00:12:46,960 --> 00:12:56,280
 OK, it is time for fact number two, and that is Anna.

241
00:12:56,280 --> 00:13:02,640
 My fact is that the last emperor of the Shang dynasty built a wine lake and a meat forest

242
00:13:02,640 --> 00:13:04,400
 for himself.

243
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:12,760
 Wow, that is, and what, so he had all loads of wine and meat whenever he needed it, I

244
00:13:12,760 --> 00:13:13,760
 guess?

245
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:17,360
 I think basically, yeah, just a meat forest sounds so disgusting, doesn't it?

246
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:20,520
 But yeah, this was a very long time ago.

247
00:13:20,520 --> 00:13:23,040
 This was over 3,000 years ago.

248
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:29,920
 It was the emperor D. Shin, and he was known for being very sort of decadent and prone

249
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:31,560
 to a bit of excess.

250
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:36,720
 And yeah, he filled a lake on his, oh, I think he dug a lake, in fact, filled it with wine.

251
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:41,720
 And then he hung cured meat from the trees all around it.

252
00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:46,800
 And according to the sources of the dynasty that came immediately after him, he got his

253
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:49,800
 courtiers to chase each other through this forest naked.

254
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:50,800
 Wow.

255
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:51,800
 Interesting.

256
00:13:51,800 --> 00:13:57,800
 So, if it came from the people who came after him, might it have been a bit of kind of propaganda

257
00:13:57,800 --> 00:13:59,880
 against him, do you think, or not?

258
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:02,640
 It's almost, I mean, I guess it's impossible to say.

259
00:14:02,640 --> 00:14:06,880
 He was definitely pretty debauched, and the reason he was removed from power, the reason

260
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:11,400
 he eventually lost the entire dynasty, which had gone on for about 600 years, is because

261
00:14:11,400 --> 00:14:14,800
 he was corrupt and, you know, excessive and stuff.

262
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:17,840
 But yeah, what's a weird coincidence, and which does imply that could be the case, is

263
00:14:17,840 --> 00:14:24,920
 that the dynasty that preceded him also fell down because the last emperor built a lake

264
00:14:24,920 --> 00:14:25,920
 of wine.

265
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:28,440
 I think the M.O.G. is not so weird.

266
00:14:28,440 --> 00:14:32,440
 Surely, one of his advisors should have said, "Wait, this didn't work last time."

267
00:14:32,440 --> 00:14:35,760
 Look, this time it will work.

268
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:38,160
 It's completely different.

269
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:42,160
 Both persuaded to do it by their concubines.

270
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:46,320
 There's always in this history, there's always some terrible woman forcing them to do it

271
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:47,320
 backstage.

272
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:48,320
 Yeah.

273
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:49,320
 How big was this lake, Anna?

274
00:14:49,320 --> 00:14:53,320
 Are we talking a genuine lake, or is it a sort of swimming pool called a lake?

275
00:14:53,320 --> 00:14:54,680
 It's not Loch Ness.

276
00:14:54,680 --> 00:14:58,680
 It's not Loch Ness, but they, astonishingly, and this must have been the most exciting

277
00:14:58,680 --> 00:15:02,320
 moment in this archeologist's life, they found a pond that matches up to it.

278
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:03,320
 This is in 1999.

279
00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:07,440
 So this is the first dynasty of which we have actual archeological evidence, so it's not

280
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:09,000
 just written stories about it.

281
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:13,080
 We've got, like, archeology that matches up, and in 1999, they found an artificial pond

282
00:15:13,080 --> 00:15:17,840
 in Yanxi, and it's 130 metres long and 20 metres wide.

283
00:15:17,840 --> 00:15:21,080
 So it's much bigger than your biggest swimming pool.

284
00:15:21,080 --> 00:15:23,960
 Largely full of water, I imagine, these days.

285
00:15:23,960 --> 00:15:24,960
 No wine left.

286
00:15:24,960 --> 00:15:25,960
 No.

287
00:15:25,960 --> 00:15:26,960
 I don't think.

288
00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:27,960
 Very diluted by this point.

289
00:15:27,960 --> 00:15:28,960
 Wow.

290
00:15:28,960 --> 00:15:29,960
 Right.

291
00:15:29,960 --> 00:15:30,960
 Yeah, because it's really interesting.

292
00:15:30,960 --> 00:15:38,240
 These Shang Dynasty, we did think that perhaps it was like a kind of a story or some thing

293
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:42,320
 that wasn't actual history, but then, like you say, they did find, I think they found some

294
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:45,040
 bones or something with things written on them or…

295
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:51,320
 Yeah, they were called dragon bones, and the idea of dragon bones were you would use these

296
00:15:51,320 --> 00:15:52,920
 for telling the future.

297
00:15:52,920 --> 00:15:58,240
 So they would write on them, and they would then put them in a fire and crack them.

298
00:15:58,240 --> 00:16:02,280
 And the bones themselves would be bones from an ox's shoulder, or they would be the flat

299
00:16:02,280 --> 00:16:04,320
 side of a tortoise shell.

300
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:08,800
 And once they cracked, wherever the lines went, that is how you told the future.

301
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:10,800
 You followed the crack lines.

302
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:15,680
 And for years, we thought that the Shang Dynasty was completely mythological, as with the

303
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:16,680
 preceding dynasty.

304
00:16:16,680 --> 00:16:20,520
 There was not really any evidence except sort of anecdotal evidence.

305
00:16:20,520 --> 00:16:27,200
 And then in the late 1800s, all of these little, supposed dragon bones were being sold by pharmacies

306
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:30,600
 in China because they were seen to be a cure for malaria.

307
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:34,920
 There was a guy called Dr. Wang Yerong, who was the director of Imperial College, who

308
00:16:34,920 --> 00:16:38,600
 had malaria, and was prescribed some of these dragon bones.

309
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:42,800
 And he was looking at them going, "Hang on a second, this looks like really old writing."

310
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:47,360
 And that's where they realised this was the original writing of the Shang Dynasty, and

311
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:48,360
 it was real.

312
00:16:48,360 --> 00:16:52,360
 Do we trust a guy who thinks that these ox bones cure malaria?

313
00:16:52,360 --> 00:16:53,360
 Yeah.

314
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:56,240
 How's he making it to Imperial College like that?

315
00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:57,760
 What year was that?

316
00:16:57,760 --> 00:17:01,560
 This is 1899, and this is the Imperial College of China.

317
00:17:01,560 --> 00:17:02,560
 And yeah.

318
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:03,560
 Oh, sorry.

319
00:17:03,560 --> 00:17:04,560
 Fair enough.

320
00:17:04,560 --> 00:17:05,560
 Well, back.

321
00:17:05,560 --> 00:17:08,880
 So malaria not cured, but you have made an unbelievable archaeological discovery.

322
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:09,880
 Exactly.

323
00:17:09,880 --> 00:17:10,880
 Swings around about.

324
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:11,880
 Very cool.

325
00:17:11,880 --> 00:17:14,200
 They seem, they're kind of like Ouija boards, aren't they?

326
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:18,600
 But sort of much harder to read, because I suppose I was looking at the process that

327
00:17:18,600 --> 00:17:22,960
 you go through when you're interpreting oracle bones, which is what they're also called.

328
00:17:22,960 --> 00:17:26,680
 And there's an example of one king, for instance, who had a toothache.

329
00:17:26,680 --> 00:17:32,320
 And what you do is you list a bunch of options for the bone, and then you ask it, you know,

330
00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:36,360
 which of these options do you pick, and whichever direction the crack goes in, refers to the

331
00:17:36,360 --> 00:17:37,360
 option.

332
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:39,520
 So this king was like, I've got a toothache.

333
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:43,200
 So first of all, which of my bastard ancestors is causing it?

334
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:45,280
 And he lists four ancestors.

335
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:48,400
 And then you've got to burn a bone, and the crack goes to the right, and they're like,

336
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:51,600
 okay, it's, you know, it's Bob, Uncle Bob, who's caused it.

337
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:54,920
 And then he's like, okay, which animal should I kill to appease Uncle Bob?

338
00:17:54,920 --> 00:17:55,920
 Should it be a puppy?

339
00:17:55,920 --> 00:17:56,920
 Should it be a pony?

340
00:17:56,920 --> 00:17:58,680
 Should it be a bald eagle?

341
00:17:58,680 --> 00:17:59,880
 And then you ask it again.

342
00:17:59,880 --> 00:18:02,960
 It's quite a laborious way of having a conversation, I guess.

343
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:06,760
 I think it's quite important with these things that they are very difficult to read, because

344
00:18:06,760 --> 00:18:08,560
 you are making it all up.

345
00:18:08,560 --> 00:18:13,920
 And so if you're, if it's something that someone else can check your work, then that's not

346
00:18:13,920 --> 00:18:14,920
 going to work out, is it?

347
00:18:14,920 --> 00:18:16,880
 It has to be something that you could say this is right.

348
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:19,960
 And when anyone says, are you sure, you're like, yeah, look where the crack goes.

349
00:18:19,960 --> 00:18:21,080
 It's obvious, isn't it?

350
00:18:21,080 --> 00:18:23,640
 Look, all I'm saying is the toothache was cured.

351
00:18:23,640 --> 00:18:26,000
 So I'm in the fight of the oracle bones.

352
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:27,000
 Wow.

353
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:28,000
 It was Uncle Bob all along.

354
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:29,000
 There we go.

355
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:33,020
 Uncle Bob is still stealing a child, a no-go zone for you.

356
00:18:33,020 --> 00:18:35,720
 The thing you said about puppies is unfortunately true, isn't it?

357
00:18:35,720 --> 00:18:39,560
 Because there were lots of shang sacrificial puppies which had been found.

358
00:18:39,560 --> 00:18:41,880
 And they're normally attached to people's graves.

359
00:18:41,880 --> 00:18:46,080
 So it was a bonus cavity that would be attached to your grave.

360
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:49,360
 And it's mostly middle-class people who did it, we think.

361
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:52,040
 And there is a kind of scale range in terms of what you could afford.

362
00:18:52,040 --> 00:18:55,660
 So if you couldn't afford a full dog to be sacrificed for your grave, you'd get a puppy

363
00:18:55,660 --> 00:18:58,160
 instead, simply because it was a bit smaller.

364
00:18:58,160 --> 00:18:59,160
 Wow.

365
00:18:59,160 --> 00:19:00,160
 Ah, okay.

366
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:08,680
 Do you know another reason why Emperor D. Shin was destroyed and why his empire fell?

367
00:19:08,680 --> 00:19:09,680
 Oh.

368
00:19:09,680 --> 00:19:14,320
 What a bad question to ask and what a bad way of phrasing it.

369
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:20,800
 Did he have a home made of trifle to go through the wheat forest?

370
00:19:20,800 --> 00:19:21,800
 That's it.

371
00:19:21,800 --> 00:19:24,800
 No, it was to do again with the religion.

372
00:19:24,800 --> 00:19:27,760
 And again, this is written by a later dynasty, so it might all be propaganda.

373
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:35,480
 But the idea is that his people ate the animal victims which were intended for the spirits,

374
00:19:35,480 --> 00:19:38,560
 probably because they might have had a bit too much to drink.

375
00:19:38,560 --> 00:19:40,840
 And so they just got a bit hungry.

376
00:19:40,840 --> 00:19:44,760
 They looked at the sacrificial animals and they thought, "Oh, we are meant to give those

377
00:19:44,760 --> 00:19:45,760
 to the spirits."

378
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:48,000
 That looks like a tasty little puppy, doesn't it?

379
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,120
 And the spirits never take them.

380
00:19:50,120 --> 00:19:52,800
 I mean, we always wake up in the morning and they're still bloody there.

381
00:19:52,800 --> 00:19:54,480
 The spirits never eat them, do they?

382
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:58,600
 I know, it's so relatable just getting a bit peckish after a few drinks and thinking,

383
00:19:58,600 --> 00:20:04,120
 "I can replace it with another puppy in the morning, can't I?"

384
00:20:04,120 --> 00:20:09,520
 He was so reviled after, actually in his reign and then immediately after it, that he is

385
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:12,880
 now known as the Emperor Zhou.

386
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:17,760
 And I've probably mispronounced that, it's about Z-H-O-U, but it's pronounced like Zhou.

387
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:21,960
 And the reason he's called that is because that is the word for the bit of a horse's

388
00:20:21,960 --> 00:20:26,680
 saddle that would tie around the horse's tail to stop the saddle from sliding forward.

389
00:20:26,680 --> 00:20:30,040
 And that's the bit that when the horse does a poo, it gets covered in poo.

390
00:20:30,040 --> 00:20:34,520
 So he's gone down in history as bit of a saddle most likely to get covered in shit.

391
00:20:34,520 --> 00:20:35,720
 That is weird.

392
00:20:35,720 --> 00:20:39,000
 I thought the next dynasty that came was also the Zhou dynasty.

393
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:40,000
 It was.

394
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:41,000
 It was extremely confusing.

395
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:42,000
 Yeah.

396
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:45,640
 But they didn't call themselves after the shitty covered horse thing, surely?

397
00:20:45,640 --> 00:20:51,920
 It's a slightly different word that to me sounds almost indistinguishable to Dan slightly

398
00:20:51,920 --> 00:20:52,920
 more adapted.

399
00:20:52,920 --> 00:20:57,720
 Mandarin is probably sounds different, but one sounds like Zhou and one sounds like Zhou.

400
00:20:57,720 --> 00:20:58,720
 Oh, OK.

401
00:20:58,720 --> 00:20:59,720
 Oh, see.

402
00:20:59,720 --> 00:21:06,120
 Can I just quickly ask just back to the very first fact, where did they get the wine from

403
00:21:06,120 --> 00:21:07,760
 to fill a lake?

404
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:09,000
 That's a lot of wine.

405
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:14,040
 Was it a bit of a faked botched job where it was mostly water and then there was just

406
00:21:14,040 --> 00:21:16,440
 a top layer of wine kind of thing?

407
00:21:16,440 --> 00:21:18,600
 I mean, it's not like oil and water.

408
00:21:18,600 --> 00:21:22,080
 People don't say they like wine and water because wine and water do mix.

409
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:24,080
 You can't just keep it on the top layer.

410
00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:29,440
 Was it just like a normal lake and Jesus walked past?

411
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:33,160
 Every time Jesus walks past your taps, oh, god damn it, I can't do the washing up anymore.

412
00:21:33,160 --> 00:21:34,160
 Jesus Christ.

413
00:21:34,160 --> 00:21:35,160
 Oh, yes.

414
00:21:35,160 --> 00:21:36,160
 That's my name.

415
00:21:36,160 --> 00:21:37,160
 It's a good question.

416
00:21:37,160 --> 00:21:41,280
 And I don't think it was the wine as we know it was some kind of alcohol, which is usually

417
00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:43,400
 referred to as wine these days.

418
00:21:43,400 --> 00:21:44,400
 Maybe more like beer.

419
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:49,440
 But I always wonder this as well, when in English historical sources, medieval times,

420
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:53,760
 they talk about fountains flowing with wine and, you know, kings went through a phase of

421
00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:58,520
 about 500 years of whenever they were celebrating anything, they had a birthday or a foreign

422
00:21:58,520 --> 00:22:02,480
 dignitary came to visit, the pipes would flow with wine.

423
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:05,800
 And no one knows how they did it, but it's in all these sources.

424
00:22:05,800 --> 00:22:11,040
 I think it started in the 1200s with Edward Longshanks and there was a royal visit and

425
00:22:11,040 --> 00:22:14,080
 it was like, you know, London flowed with wine.

426
00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:16,480
 I've got no idea how they made that happen.

427
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:17,480
 What's going on?

428
00:22:17,480 --> 00:22:21,360
 There is, there's, we might have said this before, but there is a wine kind of tap, isn't

429
00:22:21,360 --> 00:22:23,320
 there somewhere in Italy, I think.

430
00:22:23,320 --> 00:22:27,240
 There's like some pipes of wine where you can just go and fill up your bucket wherever

431
00:22:27,240 --> 00:22:28,240
 you want.

432
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:29,240
 Yes, that's right.

433
00:22:29,240 --> 00:22:30,240
 Or glass.

434
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:31,240
 Yes, there is.

435
00:22:31,240 --> 00:22:32,240
 That's very cool.

436
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:35,160
 Although, yeah, I was reading some TripAdvisor reviews of that and they did say there's

437
00:22:35,160 --> 00:22:39,280
 a sign outside it saying, "Lauts and drunkards not welcome."

438
00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:40,280
 Right.

439
00:22:40,280 --> 00:22:41,280
 This is for passing pilgrims.

440
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:43,440
 Well, that's you gone there, Nana.

441
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:44,440
 Yeah.

442
00:22:44,440 --> 00:22:47,680
 Who wants free wine if they're not allowed?

443
00:22:47,680 --> 00:22:48,680
 Yeah.

444
00:22:48,680 --> 00:22:49,680
 Outrageous.

445
00:22:49,680 --> 00:22:52,720
 That's why I gave it one star.

446
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:58,400
 One exciting Shang Dynasty discovery was a tomb of a fabled character.

447
00:22:58,400 --> 00:23:03,160
 Again, we thought that she was entirely mythological called Fuhao.

448
00:23:03,160 --> 00:23:10,280
 She was a wife of one of the emperors and she appears on over 180 of these dragon bones

449
00:23:10,280 --> 00:23:13,960
 as a sort of story, but no one could prove that she ever existed.

450
00:23:13,960 --> 00:23:20,440
 And then there was an archaeologist called Jiang Jianxiang who was basically the first

451
00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:23,040
 female archaeologist of New China.

452
00:23:23,040 --> 00:23:29,880
 So she came about during the Cultural Revolution and she discovered the tomb of Fuhao and it

453
00:23:29,880 --> 00:23:36,120
 was the only untouched tomb of a royal that they have ever found in China.

454
00:23:36,120 --> 00:23:40,500
 It's basically the equivalent of the Tutankhamun discovery of his tomb.

455
00:23:40,500 --> 00:23:41,580
 Everything was intact.

456
00:23:41,580 --> 00:23:42,580
 Everything was in there.

457
00:23:42,580 --> 00:23:43,920
 I like the way that they call it.

458
00:23:43,920 --> 00:23:48,400
 They say, "Oh, this is the first untouched tomb that we found and then deliberately

459
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:49,400
 go and touch it."

460
00:23:49,400 --> 00:23:50,400
 Yes.

461
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:54,000
 It's like, you know, they've only done exactly the same as all the previous people have done.

462
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:55,000
 Yeah.

463
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:58,320
 I guess it's because they've left an itinerary of what they've taken from it that that's

464
00:23:58,320 --> 00:24:01,680
 the difference, that we're like, "Oh, okay, we know everything that was there before you

465
00:24:01,680 --> 00:24:02,680
 stole it."

466
00:24:02,680 --> 00:24:03,680
 Yeah.

467
00:24:03,680 --> 00:24:05,320
 Now you just have to buy a flight to the British Museum in order to see it.

468
00:24:05,320 --> 00:24:06,320
 I'm very sorry.

469
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:07,320
 Exactly.

470
00:24:07,320 --> 00:24:09,320
 At least you know where it is.

471
00:24:09,320 --> 00:24:10,320
 Yeah.

472
00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:14,960
 But she is an amazing character, by the way, Jiang Jianxiang, this archaeologist from China.

473
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:19,120
 And I read about her story in a fantastic website that people must check out.

474
00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:23,160
 It's called Trial Blazers as in a trowel for digging.

475
00:24:23,160 --> 00:24:27,000
 And it's a website which is in celebration of women archaeologists, paleontologists and

476
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:31,000
 geologists who've been doing awesome work for far longer and far greater numbers than

477
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:34,400
 most people realize is the mission statement of the website.

478
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:38,520
 And it's just packed with all these incredible women who are making these discoveries, like

479
00:24:38,520 --> 00:24:42,440
 Jiang Jianxiang, who is the first lady of archaeology there.

480
00:24:42,440 --> 00:24:48,640
 And they did discover inside the tomb, they found all these things like 16 human corpses

481
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:53,800
 that they believe were sacrifices of slaves to come into the afterlife with her.

482
00:24:53,800 --> 00:24:57,560
 They found, as you say, Andy, dogs, there were six sacrificial dogs.

483
00:24:57,560 --> 00:24:59,160
 And shed loads of weapons, right?

484
00:24:59,160 --> 00:25:00,160
 She's a warrior.

485
00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:03,400
 In fact, I think she was general of the army and led the forces to like the biggest victory

486
00:25:03,400 --> 00:25:04,400
 of this entry.

487
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:06,280
 And they found hundreds of weapons with her.

488
00:25:06,280 --> 00:25:07,280
 Yeah.

489
00:25:07,280 --> 00:25:11,040
 She was the leader of the largest army that we know of in ancient Chinese history.

490
00:25:11,040 --> 00:25:12,040
 Wow.

491
00:25:12,040 --> 00:25:13,040
 13,000 men.

492
00:25:13,040 --> 00:25:14,040
 Yeah.

493
00:25:14,040 --> 00:25:15,040
 It's amazing.

494
00:25:15,040 --> 00:25:16,680
 And if you were that posh, you could get a human sacrifice.

495
00:25:16,680 --> 00:25:20,480
 I think, so the dogs maybe were for, you know, if you couldn't quite afford the people.

496
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:23,640
 But I think, you know, you've really made it in life when you can convince 16 people

497
00:25:23,640 --> 00:25:25,360
 to die when you die.

498
00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:31,960
 They think that possibly the Xiang dynasty had a collection of future human sacrifices.

499
00:25:31,960 --> 00:25:37,680
 A bit like if you can imagine a giant freezer with a load of eagle parts in it, but with

500
00:25:37,680 --> 00:25:39,200
 humans instead.

501
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:40,200
 Wow.

502
00:25:40,200 --> 00:25:41,200
 Yeah.

503
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:44,920
 They reckoned because they would do these big sort of human sacrifices, loads at the

504
00:25:44,920 --> 00:25:45,920
 same time.

505
00:25:45,920 --> 00:25:50,720
 And they could tell that, you know, these people had been not very well fed for a certain

506
00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:52,520
 amount of time.

507
00:25:52,520 --> 00:25:54,840
 They can tell that they were kept as prisoners.

508
00:25:54,840 --> 00:26:00,280
 And the idea is that whenever you needed a human sacrifice because you wanted to show

509
00:26:00,280 --> 00:26:05,080
 strength because you're the leader or perhaps, you know, for some religious reason, you would

510
00:26:05,080 --> 00:26:10,520
 go to this pool of sacrificial victims and say, OK, I need 12 sacrifices, please.

511
00:26:10,520 --> 00:26:11,520
 OK.

512
00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:12,520
 Like a puncture.

513
00:26:12,520 --> 00:26:15,720
 If you were kept in better conditions, after all, it's befitting that a human sacrifice

514
00:26:15,720 --> 00:26:17,520
 should be kept in decent conditions.

515
00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:22,320
 Would you volunteer to be a human sacrifice if you knew that at some point in the future,

516
00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:23,480
 your number would be up and you'd be summed?

517
00:26:23,480 --> 00:26:27,240
 How much better would my conditions be than my current conditions?

518
00:26:27,240 --> 00:26:31,000
 Well, I mean, I could see in the background of the Zoom called James that you've got your

519
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:36,040
 meat forest and your wide leg behind you, so it can't get much better.

520
00:26:36,040 --> 00:26:37,400
 No, you're right.

521
00:26:37,400 --> 00:26:41,920
 You get to live like Elon Musk, but you will die within two weeks.

522
00:26:41,920 --> 00:26:45,240
 Do I have to do really irritating tweets all the time?

523
00:26:45,240 --> 00:26:50,800
 What do you, well, that might be a stretch, James.

524
00:26:50,800 --> 00:26:52,800
 Continue as you were.

525
00:26:52,800 --> 00:27:01,520
 You know, speaking of meat forests, the leopard is an animal that likes to put meat into trees.

526
00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:02,520
 Really?

527
00:27:02,520 --> 00:27:03,520
 Yeah.

528
00:27:03,520 --> 00:27:07,280
 Sometimes it'll kill something like something as big as a small giraffe, for instance.

529
00:27:07,280 --> 00:27:12,960
 And then to stop any hyenas or lions from eating it, but it can't eat it all at once

530
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:18,120
 because it's too big, it'll drag it up into a tree and then leave it hanging there and

531
00:27:18,120 --> 00:27:21,120
 then just munch on it when it feels like it.

532
00:27:21,120 --> 00:27:26,480
 And there's some examples of leopards carrying such big amounts of meat up these trees that

533
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:34,120
 it's the equivalent of a human carrying 2,000 Big Macs up two floors in one go.

534
00:27:34,120 --> 00:27:35,120
 What?

535
00:27:35,120 --> 00:27:39,560
 That's a bad hangover you've got when that's your Saturday.

536
00:27:39,560 --> 00:27:41,680
 That poor delivery guy.

537
00:27:41,680 --> 00:27:43,360
 Do you love fries with that?

538
00:27:43,360 --> 00:27:44,360
 You know what?

539
00:27:44,360 --> 00:27:45,360
 Probably not.

540
00:27:45,360 --> 00:27:56,400
 OK, it is time for fact number three, and that is Andy.

541
00:27:56,400 --> 00:28:00,520
 My fact is that if you look at your phone when you're out, half the people around you will

542
00:28:00,520 --> 00:28:02,720
 do the same within 30 seconds.

543
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:03,720
 What?

544
00:28:03,720 --> 00:28:04,960
 Half the people around you will look at your phone?

545
00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:06,600
 I'd say that's an invasion of privacy.

546
00:28:06,600 --> 00:28:10,200
 Yeah, so be careful what you're looking at.

547
00:28:10,200 --> 00:28:13,240
 I assume it's people looking at their own phones.

548
00:28:13,240 --> 00:28:16,680
 I'm almost surprised it's only half, I have to say.

549
00:28:16,680 --> 00:28:17,680
 It's true.

550
00:28:17,680 --> 00:28:20,360
 From experience, it's so catching, isn't it?

551
00:28:20,360 --> 00:28:22,600
 Yeah, it's really bizarre.

552
00:28:22,600 --> 00:28:27,800
 So this is something that I think is probably anecdotally observed a lot, and it's finally

553
00:28:27,800 --> 00:28:35,720
 been studied by a team at the University of Pisa, and it's a team led by Veronica Maglieri,

554
00:28:35,720 --> 00:28:38,000
 observed nearly 200 people, and they did so in the field.

555
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:42,720
 They went out and about, and they looked at men and women in social settings, and there

556
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:48,040
 were various trigger individuals that they were observing, and if those trigger individuals

557
00:28:48,040 --> 00:28:52,720
 looked at their phone very shortly afterwards, about 50% of the people around them did the

558
00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:53,720
 same.

559
00:28:53,720 --> 00:28:56,960
 Didn't they say as well that you had to actively engage with the phone as well?

560
00:28:56,960 --> 00:29:00,780
 So they noticed that if you sort of in passing looked at your phone, it didn't trigger off

561
00:29:00,780 --> 00:29:06,500
 people doing it, but if you picked it up and you did a swipe and you were actively engaging

562
00:29:06,500 --> 00:29:10,920
 with your phone, that's when everyone started doing it, yeah.

563
00:29:10,920 --> 00:29:16,400
 And this is called the chameleon effect, right, where you mimic what other people are doing,

564
00:29:16,400 --> 00:29:23,120
 and it was coined by Dr. Tanya Chatrand, and I listened to a podcast that she was in.

565
00:29:23,120 --> 00:29:27,720
 This was the annual reviews conversations podcast, and it was absolutely brilliant.

566
00:29:27,720 --> 00:29:32,640
 She just talked about where she came up with the idea, so she was a student, and there

567
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:37,200
 was one of her fellow students who was a bit more senior than her.

568
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:42,240
 He had a beard, and he had this weird mannerism, she said, where he kind of would pull his

569
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:47,000
 beard whenever he was doing any work, and she noticed that even though she didn't have

570
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:51,480
 a beard, she kept pulling this little bit of skin on the bottom of her chin, and she

571
00:29:51,480 --> 00:29:53,960
 suddenly thought, wait a minute, why am I doing that?

572
00:29:53,960 --> 00:29:58,500
 Is it because I'm mimicking him because he's got a slightly higher status than me?

573
00:29:58,500 --> 00:30:02,700
 And then that became the subject of, I think, her PhD.

574
00:30:02,700 --> 00:30:08,200
 That is so cool and interesting, and actually, on that note, I had a tutor when I was at

575
00:30:08,200 --> 00:30:14,600
 university who had a very thick and bushy beard, and at the start of a tutorial, if he was

576
00:30:14,600 --> 00:30:18,480
 only slightly interested in what you're saying, he would start winding one finger around in

577
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:23,160
 his beard, but if you got more intellectually stimulating to him, two fingers would get

578
00:30:23,160 --> 00:30:29,640
 in there and start grinding around, and by the end of the tutorial, both hands would

579
00:30:29,640 --> 00:30:32,880
 be fully grinding through the beard.

580
00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:33,880
 It was nightmare.

581
00:30:33,880 --> 00:30:39,800
 It sounds like he had a lice problem to me.

582
00:30:39,800 --> 00:30:44,720
 It does happen, according to Dr. Chartrand in this podcast that I was listening to, it

583
00:30:44,720 --> 00:30:50,000
 does happen with people who you respect, people of a higher status, but actually, there is

584
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:54,100
 a baseline, even if you're with a stranger, someone you've never met, you're never going

585
00:30:54,100 --> 00:30:59,160
 to meet again, you just kind of sat on a train platform and they're doing something, rubbing

586
00:30:59,160 --> 00:31:03,760
 their fingers in the massive bushy beard or whatever, then you might copy that, and there

587
00:31:03,760 --> 00:31:07,880
 is a kind of a small amount of it that happens no matter who you're next to.

588
00:31:07,880 --> 00:31:13,480
 This mimicking thing, though, it even happens when it's very disadvantageous to you, so

589
00:31:13,480 --> 00:31:19,440
 Rock Paper Scissors, the game we all know and love, when people play Rock Paper Scissors,

590
00:31:19,440 --> 00:31:24,560
 they mimic each other unconsciously, and this has been tested by scientists from UCL who

591
00:31:24,560 --> 00:31:29,680
 set up a series of Rock Paper Scissors games where either one player or both players were

592
00:31:29,680 --> 00:31:31,080
 blindfolded, okay?

593
00:31:31,080 --> 00:31:32,080
 Okay.

594
00:31:32,080 --> 00:31:37,480
 I mean, the most pointless Rock Paper Scissors games imaginable, but when both of them were

595
00:31:37,480 --> 00:31:43,440
 blindfolded, they didn't imitate each other, but when there was one person blindfolded and

596
00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:49,200
 they played one of the three options, the sighted player, the one who wasn't blindfolded, was

597
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:54,240
 slightly more likely, very slightly more likely to play the same thing, which is baffling,

598
00:31:54,240 --> 00:31:57,280
 because obviously that's not how you win Rock Paper Scissors, and also you're playing someone

599
00:31:57,280 --> 00:32:01,960
 blindfolded, just wait until they've made their clear offer and then play the thing that wins.

600
00:32:01,960 --> 00:32:02,960
 However, yes.

601
00:32:02,960 --> 00:32:07,360
 Yeah, what's incredible to me is that we haven't managed to hack into our subconscious and be

602
00:32:07,360 --> 00:32:11,760
 able to win Rock Paper Scissors because it's extraordinary that your subconscious knows

603
00:32:11,760 --> 00:32:14,440
 what your opponent's going to do, but it won't tell you in time.

604
00:32:14,440 --> 00:32:15,440
 No, you're right.

605
00:32:15,440 --> 00:32:20,320
 With this fact about, so you're saying that there's disadvantages where it still happens,

606
00:32:20,320 --> 00:32:26,360
 but for me, the confusing thing about your fact is that if I was mimicking, as you say,

607
00:32:26,360 --> 00:32:31,320
 like twiddling a bit of the skin of your chin, that there's nothing there that you're doing

608
00:32:31,320 --> 00:32:35,800
 that you're conscious of, whereas checking your phone is an active thing.

609
00:32:35,800 --> 00:32:39,000
 So if you see someone else checking their phone, you might go, oh, I should check my

610
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:40,000
 phone.

611
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:43,880
 It's a reminder rather than a social mimicking thing, so am I misunderstanding that?

612
00:32:43,880 --> 00:32:44,880
 I don't think so.

613
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:48,620
 I think sometimes you just check your phone without thinking, right?

614
00:32:48,620 --> 00:32:52,920
 You're just kind of sat around looking at the leaning tower of Pisa, and your phone's

615
00:32:52,920 --> 00:32:56,120
 next to you and you think, well, I've seen that leaning tower of Pisa for three hours

616
00:32:56,120 --> 00:32:57,120
 now.

617
00:32:57,120 --> 00:32:58,120
 Noffy's changed.

618
00:32:58,120 --> 00:32:59,120
 It's still leaning.

619
00:32:59,120 --> 00:33:00,120
 He's not moving anywhere.

620
00:33:00,120 --> 00:33:01,120
 I'm going to look at my phone.

621
00:33:01,120 --> 00:33:02,120
 How was your holiday?

622
00:33:02,120 --> 00:33:09,280
 But yeah, I mean, it's more of a subconscious thing, I think.

623
00:33:09,280 --> 00:33:11,720
 Sometimes you just do it reactionary without thinking.

624
00:33:11,720 --> 00:33:12,720
 Yeah.

625
00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:13,720
 I think that was what they found.

626
00:33:13,720 --> 00:33:14,720
 Yeah.

627
00:33:14,720 --> 00:33:15,720
 It's a subconscious.

628
00:33:15,720 --> 00:33:19,680
 Obviously, it's conscious once you're writing a long and heartfelt message to your aunt,

629
00:33:19,680 --> 00:33:23,920
 but the action of picking it up and looking at it, which is what kicks that off.

630
00:33:23,920 --> 00:33:28,120
 All the people you could have chosen to write a long and heartfelt message to.

631
00:33:28,120 --> 00:33:34,120
 Maybe not leave Dad's relationship with his auntie.

632
00:33:34,120 --> 00:33:35,120
 They're very close.

633
00:33:35,120 --> 00:33:38,120
 I do not appreciate you bringing that up, Adam.

634
00:33:38,120 --> 00:33:39,120
 It's private.

635
00:33:39,120 --> 00:33:40,120
 I'm sorry.

636
00:33:40,120 --> 00:33:45,360
 As well as the chameleon effect, there is a reverse chameleon effect, and what this

637
00:33:45,360 --> 00:33:54,280
 is is let's say I'm sat opposite you and you're scratching the right-hand side of your face,

638
00:33:54,280 --> 00:34:00,800
 then to mimic you, I will scratch the left-hand side of my face, and it's as if it's a mirror.

639
00:34:00,800 --> 00:34:02,720
 Do you know what I mean?

640
00:34:02,720 --> 00:34:06,720
 But if you do it the other way, so if you scratch the right-hand side of your face,

641
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:10,960
 and I scratch the right-hand side of my face, then actually, rather than having positive

642
00:34:10,960 --> 00:34:15,800
 feelings for me, because you can see that I'm mimicking you, you'll have negative feelings

643
00:34:15,800 --> 00:34:17,640
 for me.

644
00:34:17,640 --> 00:34:23,280
 That was a study only in 2020 by a guy called Daniel Casasanto and his team.

645
00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:29,700
 It was in the journal Psychology, and they set up a digital face that would copy what

646
00:34:29,700 --> 00:34:34,840
 you were doing, and it found that people who were opposite this face when it was doing

647
00:34:34,840 --> 00:34:40,040
 this weird non-mirroring mirroring, they would feel really negative about it.

648
00:34:40,040 --> 00:34:41,040
 Wow.

649
00:34:41,040 --> 00:34:44,800
 Well, it's annoying if you're walking with someone, you go in one direction, and they

650
00:34:44,800 --> 00:34:46,760
 immediately go in the opposite direction.

651
00:34:46,760 --> 00:34:49,120
 It kills the conversation.

652
00:34:49,120 --> 00:34:52,240
 There's probably underlying reasons that that's happening, I suppose.

653
00:34:52,240 --> 00:34:55,680
 No, it's a subconscious response, I'm sure of it.

654
00:34:55,680 --> 00:35:02,020
 Do you guys have, at the right-hand side of your head, around the hairline, a little lump

655
00:35:02,020 --> 00:35:03,020
 or bump?

656
00:35:03,020 --> 00:35:08,000
 Well, my hairline is getting a lot further back, because, yes, come on, does the bump

657
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:09,000
 move as well?

658
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:10,000
 I think the bump stays the same.

659
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:11,800
 The bump's a skull thing.

660
00:35:11,800 --> 00:35:13,120
 I'm not sure.

661
00:35:13,120 --> 00:35:16,440
 This is an amazing, you're all feeling your heads now, okay.

662
00:35:16,440 --> 00:35:20,240
 This isn't mimicry, Andy, if you're trying to make us all copy your things.

663
00:35:20,240 --> 00:35:27,520
 I'm trying to make you find your organ of imitation, and this was a phrenological concept

664
00:35:27,520 --> 00:35:33,440
 in the 19th century, and the idea was that if you had a very lumpy bit of your skull

665
00:35:33,440 --> 00:35:39,160
 just there, that was an enormous organ of imitation, and you would be a very good mimic,

666
00:35:39,160 --> 00:35:44,080
 and you might be an actor, but you also might be a liar, you might be a fraudster.

667
00:35:44,080 --> 00:35:45,960
 That was where it was.

668
00:35:45,960 --> 00:35:50,560
 But you could only really mimic someone else who had a massive growth on the side of the

669
00:35:50,560 --> 00:35:51,560
 head.

670
00:35:51,560 --> 00:35:52,560
 How big are we talking?

671
00:35:52,560 --> 00:35:58,040
 Is it, you know, like a hockey stick sticking out of your forehead?

672
00:35:58,040 --> 00:35:59,040
 Just there.

673
00:35:59,040 --> 00:36:00,040
 Just, you know, a lump or a bump.

674
00:36:00,040 --> 00:36:03,560
 I can't tell, because obviously, everyone's skulls have, you know, different shapes all

675
00:36:03,560 --> 00:36:06,020
 the way around, and it's obviously nonsense, but...

676
00:36:06,020 --> 00:36:09,720
 That's why at the Oscars, when you see all the nominees who are about to be announced,

677
00:36:09,720 --> 00:36:14,480
 the winner, it's the one with a giant protruding lump that you know is about to get it.

678
00:36:14,480 --> 00:36:19,080
 It sounds to me like it's someone who's been punched in the head so many times, they think

679
00:36:19,080 --> 00:36:23,180
 the way to make people like me is by imitating them, and so they go and do it.

680
00:36:23,180 --> 00:36:26,920
 I mean, surely that's the cause and effect as far as I'm concerned.

681
00:36:26,920 --> 00:36:30,480
 I suppose what we are actually saying here is that phrenology doesn't work.

682
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:31,480
 That's what I'm saying.

683
00:36:31,480 --> 00:36:32,480
 Yeah.

684
00:36:32,480 --> 00:36:33,480
 Yeah.

685
00:36:33,480 --> 00:36:39,120
 There was a Dutch study by a psychologist that showed, and this is a handy tip for anyone

686
00:36:39,120 --> 00:36:46,160
 who works in restaurants and is waiting staff, that if you copy the behavior of the customer...

687
00:36:46,160 --> 00:36:49,640
 So you give them the food as well.

688
00:36:49,640 --> 00:36:53,560
 You give them the food, and then you set opposite them, and just have the same thing.

689
00:36:53,560 --> 00:36:54,560
 Yeah.

690
00:36:54,560 --> 00:37:00,040
 Go up to them and give them your order, and then they'll go off and do it.

691
00:37:00,040 --> 00:37:01,800
 They'll just mimic what you would have been doing.

692
00:37:01,800 --> 00:37:02,800
 What do you mean?

693
00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:06,880
 The idea is that if you can relate to the customer more, you're more likely to get a

694
00:37:06,880 --> 00:37:08,520
 tip from them.

695
00:37:08,520 --> 00:37:13,480
 So they found that if you were the waiting staff and you went up to them and they made

696
00:37:13,480 --> 00:37:17,880
 the order, if you repeat the order back to them, that almost heightens the fact that you'll

697
00:37:17,880 --> 00:37:21,160
 get a tip because it makes them feel like you're friendly with them.

698
00:37:21,160 --> 00:37:24,640
 If you bend down next to them while they're giving you their order, that's been shown to

699
00:37:24,640 --> 00:37:27,200
 increase tip-inch as well.

700
00:37:27,200 --> 00:37:33,120
 When you say bend down next to them, you bend your knees and sort of get down to their level

701
00:37:33,120 --> 00:37:38,560
 and still look at them in the face, you don't turn around and you don't give your ass.

702
00:37:38,560 --> 00:37:40,040
 Yeah, don't Ace Ventura it.

703
00:37:40,040 --> 00:37:41,040
 Yeah.

704
00:37:41,040 --> 00:37:44,600
 I guess the reason that we sort of do this is because people like it, right?

705
00:37:44,600 --> 00:37:45,600
 And that's why you'll tip.

706
00:37:45,600 --> 00:37:49,080
 It's because you like it when your waiter mimics you in a way.

707
00:37:49,080 --> 00:37:54,680
 And I read a really interesting article saying copying might be what makes us human.

708
00:37:54,680 --> 00:37:56,520
 So we've actually evolved it.

709
00:37:56,520 --> 00:37:59,960
 So a lot of people say it's like innovation and ideas, right?

710
00:37:59,960 --> 00:38:04,040
 And we've invented so much stuff that other species haven't.

711
00:38:04,040 --> 00:38:08,400
 But they did this experiment that's really interesting where toddlers and chimps were

712
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:13,000
 both shown a box with a treat inside it, like sweets or something.

713
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:18,800
 And then the experimenter showed them how to open the box, but they added a irrelevant

714
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:20,280
 motion during the opening.

715
00:38:20,280 --> 00:38:23,280
 So they tapped the box just before opening it.

716
00:38:23,280 --> 00:38:27,200
 And then they gave it to the child, the toddler or the chimp to see if they were able to open

717
00:38:27,200 --> 00:38:28,520
 the box.

718
00:38:28,520 --> 00:38:32,180
 And the chimps realized straight away that the tap was irrelevant.

719
00:38:32,180 --> 00:38:35,920
 So they copied all the other stuff that the human had done, worked out to open the box,

720
00:38:35,920 --> 00:38:37,440
 but could see that the tap was irrelevant.

721
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:40,800
 Whereas the toddlers all still tapped the box.

722
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:42,720
 And this is like over imitation.

723
00:38:42,720 --> 00:38:46,920
 It's like we imitate everything people do, even if it's totally useless.

724
00:38:46,920 --> 00:38:50,800
 And the idea is that this is how we've developed this amazing culture.

725
00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:55,000
 Because the only way that humans are so successful is that we've developed skills and technology

726
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:56,000
 over generations.

727
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:58,520
 Like no one can make a mobile phone from scratch.

728
00:38:58,520 --> 00:39:01,960
 No one really could work out the best way to build a canoe even.

729
00:39:01,960 --> 00:39:07,320
 So it's by copying bit by bit exactly what our ancestors have done or what our parents

730
00:39:07,320 --> 00:39:09,880
 are doing that makes us really successful.

731
00:39:09,880 --> 00:39:13,160
 But it does mean that we do point and a shit like tapping a box with the chip next to us

732
00:39:13,160 --> 00:39:15,340
 going, why are you doing that, mate?

733
00:39:15,340 --> 00:39:18,720
 Well, that's how we invented drumming as well.

734
00:39:18,720 --> 00:39:19,720
 Exactly.

735
00:39:19,720 --> 00:39:21,120
 Just tapping the box.

736
00:39:21,120 --> 00:39:26,640
 There is a thing where, like you say, it makes you feel better if people copy you.

737
00:39:26,640 --> 00:39:33,520
 But you kind of inherently know how much mimicry there should be depending on a situation.

738
00:39:33,520 --> 00:39:38,400
 And if there is too much or too little, this again, this is according to Dr. Charter and

739
00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:43,400
 in this podcast that I was listening to, she said that if there's too much or too little

740
00:39:43,400 --> 00:39:49,100
 mimicry, then it kind of hurts your self-control so you can't self-control as much.

741
00:39:49,100 --> 00:39:53,200
 You procrastinate more and you eat more junk food and have worse motor control.

742
00:39:53,200 --> 00:39:56,880
 So your reactions are even slightly worse as well.

743
00:39:56,880 --> 00:40:01,640
 And all these things can affect you from just someone mimicking you too much or not enough.

744
00:40:01,640 --> 00:40:04,680
 That's really passing the buck, passing the blame on, isn't it?

745
00:40:04,680 --> 00:40:08,320
 The only reason I had those 8,000 Big Macs or whatever it was, like carried up the stairs

746
00:40:08,320 --> 00:40:14,800
 is because you keep not copying it enough.

747
00:40:14,800 --> 00:40:22,300
 Okay, it's time for our final fact of the show and that is my fact.

748
00:40:22,300 --> 00:40:28,540
 My fact this week is that elephants can down 5 pints in under a second.

749
00:40:28,540 --> 00:40:33,300
 Wow, they wouldn't be allowed near that wine tap, would they?

750
00:40:33,300 --> 00:40:36,220
 That's the very definition of alcoholic and loud.

751
00:40:36,220 --> 00:40:41,620
 Oh my god, that Shang Dynasty lake would be drained.

752
00:40:41,620 --> 00:40:47,360
 Just to clarify very quickly, it is obviously the trunk is not the bit that they drink through.

753
00:40:47,360 --> 00:40:51,840
 The trunk is basically a storage unit, isn't it?

754
00:40:51,840 --> 00:40:55,840
 It's where they suck up and they can hold the content in and then they pass it through

755
00:40:55,840 --> 00:40:57,000
 to their mouth.

756
00:40:57,000 --> 00:41:00,640
 But recently there's new research which was published in the Journal of the Royal Society

757
00:41:00,640 --> 00:41:06,280
 Interface which found that when they suck up, either drink or when they're trying to

758
00:41:06,280 --> 00:41:15,900
 eat food, that the suction is so great that they can inhale air at 330 miles per hour.

759
00:41:15,900 --> 00:41:17,420
 That's ridiculous.

760
00:41:17,420 --> 00:41:22,340
 But I still think in a downing contest, I don't mean to quibble but that doesn't count.

761
00:41:22,340 --> 00:41:27,820
 This is like me taking part in a downing competition, pouring my 5 pints into a big bucket next

762
00:41:27,820 --> 00:41:31,220
 to me and going I win, oh yeah, I'm just going to drink them later.

763
00:41:31,220 --> 00:41:32,220
 No.

764
00:41:32,220 --> 00:41:38,080
 It's like you're taking 5 pints and snorting them up your nose and then dribbling it out

765
00:41:38,080 --> 00:41:44,420
 of your nose into your mouth later, which I must admit, I have seen you do that.

766
00:41:44,420 --> 00:41:45,420
 I really like it.

767
00:41:45,420 --> 00:41:47,620
 Did you say the Royal Society Interface then?

768
00:41:47,620 --> 00:41:48,620
 Yes.

769
00:41:48,620 --> 00:41:50,380
 Because it is literally about something going into a face.

770
00:41:50,380 --> 00:41:51,620
 Oh, it is.

771
00:41:51,620 --> 00:41:53,120
 It's very true.

772
00:41:53,120 --> 00:41:59,540
 Just to contextualize that speed, 330 miles per hour, that is faster than a Japanese bullet

773
00:41:59,540 --> 00:42:00,940
 train travels.

774
00:42:00,940 --> 00:42:02,380
 It's incredibly fast.

775
00:42:02,380 --> 00:42:05,780
 In the article, they say that it's 30 times faster than a human sneeze.

776
00:42:05,780 --> 00:42:09,420
 It's a picture because that feels like that's the speed of light when you do that.

777
00:42:09,420 --> 00:42:12,740
 It's 30 times that.

778
00:42:12,740 --> 00:42:20,220
 This speed of sucking water, I found is six times faster than the world's fastest waterslide.

779
00:42:20,220 --> 00:42:25,220
 And then I got right back onto waterslides again from the other week because the world

780
00:42:25,220 --> 00:42:30,740
 record fastest speed ever on a waterslide is 57 miles per hour.

781
00:42:30,740 --> 00:42:37,980
 And it was done in 2009 by a guy called Jens Scherer, who is a German advertising executive.

782
00:42:37,980 --> 00:42:41,340
 And according to this article in "Outside Magazine" and nowhere else on the internet

783
00:42:41,340 --> 00:42:46,860
 as far as I can find it, there's a thing in Germany called speed shooting where you have

784
00:42:46,860 --> 00:42:50,940
 to go down a watershoe as quickly as you possibly can.

785
00:42:50,940 --> 00:42:56,340
 And this journalist met up with Jens Scherer and tried to work out how to do it.

786
00:42:56,340 --> 00:43:01,300
 And apparently the trick is you isolate a couple of muscles in your stomach and you

787
00:43:01,300 --> 00:43:02,900
 really work on them.

788
00:43:02,900 --> 00:43:06,740
 And then you have to minimise the surface area of your skin on the watershoots.

789
00:43:06,740 --> 00:43:12,620
 So the way you do it is you have your shoulder blades on the shoot and just one heel that

790
00:43:12,620 --> 00:43:13,620
 goes on the shoot.

791
00:43:13,620 --> 00:43:17,740
 And there's only three points that are touching the watershoots and it makes you fly down

792
00:43:17,740 --> 00:43:19,860
 really, really, really fast.

793
00:43:19,860 --> 00:43:21,860
 You also have the cannonballs.

794
00:43:21,860 --> 00:43:28,180
 And these are the really fat shooters who, according to Scherer, have no technique, just

795
00:43:28,180 --> 00:43:29,180
 stomachs.

796
00:43:29,180 --> 00:43:31,500
 I know which method I prefer.

797
00:43:31,500 --> 00:43:34,980
 I'd rather overeat for a year and win that contest.

798
00:43:34,980 --> 00:43:38,740
 Well, you know, Scherer, he takes this really seriously.

799
00:43:38,740 --> 00:43:43,260
 He was very, very small speedos because he thinks that skin is the fastest way of doing

800
00:43:43,260 --> 00:43:44,940
 it, just human skin.

801
00:43:44,940 --> 00:43:46,140
 But he has tried other things.

802
00:43:46,140 --> 00:43:51,820
 He's tried covering himself in soap, in oil, in wax, in a special hydrophobic gel.

803
00:43:51,820 --> 00:43:54,020
 He covered himself in to see if he could go faster.

804
00:43:54,020 --> 00:44:00,340
 And he also used a type of cream used to tenderise the udders of dairy cows to make himself

805
00:44:00,340 --> 00:44:01,860
 go faster on watershoots.

806
00:44:01,860 --> 00:44:02,860
 But apparently...

807
00:44:02,860 --> 00:44:03,860
 Wait, hang on.

808
00:44:03,860 --> 00:44:04,860
 You said he was an advertising executive.

809
00:44:04,860 --> 00:44:07,900
 How has he got access to the cream that he used to lubricate the udders of dairy cows?

810
00:44:07,900 --> 00:44:09,340
 Well, where have you used advertising that?

811
00:44:09,340 --> 00:44:10,340
 I don't know.

812
00:44:10,340 --> 00:44:11,340
 Good point.

813
00:44:11,340 --> 00:44:12,340
 Yep.

814
00:44:12,340 --> 00:44:13,340
 Very good point.

815
00:44:13,340 --> 00:44:14,340
 Stacks up.

816
00:44:14,340 --> 00:44:20,420
 I always see big poster ad campaigns for cow udder lubrication cream.

817
00:44:20,420 --> 00:44:25,180
 I cannot believe you've used this Elephant Trunk fact as an excuse to use all your unused

818
00:44:25,180 --> 00:44:26,180
 research from last week.

819
00:44:26,180 --> 00:44:27,180
 I know.

820
00:44:27,180 --> 00:44:29,380
 You've just sort of stuck a time tunnel three weeks back into the past.

821
00:44:29,380 --> 00:44:32,100
 I promise you, I found this all brand new stuff this week.

822
00:44:32,100 --> 00:44:35,500
 I was absolutely devastated I didn't find it three weeks ago.

823
00:44:35,500 --> 00:44:39,340
 I do think that a waterslide that was called the Elephant's Trunk that involved firing

824
00:44:39,340 --> 00:44:44,980
 you up a slide incredibly fast is a good idea if anyone is out there wanting to...

825
00:44:44,980 --> 00:44:46,180
 A reverse waterslide?

826
00:44:46,180 --> 00:44:47,180
 Yeah.

827
00:44:47,180 --> 00:44:48,180
 Firing it, yeah.

828
00:44:48,180 --> 00:44:49,180
 But is there blow?

829
00:44:49,180 --> 00:44:50,180
 Do you think it sucks up it?

830
00:44:50,180 --> 00:44:51,180
 Oh, yeah.

831
00:44:51,180 --> 00:44:52,180
 Nice.

832
00:44:52,180 --> 00:44:54,740
 So, do you start in the pool?

833
00:44:54,740 --> 00:44:58,660
 Everyone's in the pool and you don't know one random person every minute is going to

834
00:44:58,660 --> 00:45:01,460
 get sucked back up the tube to the very top.

835
00:45:01,460 --> 00:45:02,460
 Yeah.

836
00:45:02,460 --> 00:45:03,460
 And you don't know who it's going to be.

837
00:45:03,460 --> 00:45:04,460
 That's stressful.

838
00:45:04,460 --> 00:45:05,900
 And then do you have to walk down?

839
00:45:05,900 --> 00:45:06,900
 Yes.

840
00:45:06,900 --> 00:45:12,980
 You have to queue down the steps for ages at the end.

841
00:45:12,980 --> 00:45:21,260
 So, one thing elephants do with their trunks is to touch each other's genitals to comfort

842
00:45:21,260 --> 00:45:22,500
 each other.

843
00:45:22,500 --> 00:45:30,500
 If one of their friends is distressed, they will just kind of cop a feel or the alternative

844
00:45:30,500 --> 00:45:34,940
 thing they do is to put their trunk in their friend's mouth to sort of stick it in there.

845
00:45:34,940 --> 00:45:36,900
 And that's another way of calming them down.

846
00:45:36,900 --> 00:45:37,900
 Yeah.

847
00:45:37,900 --> 00:45:38,900
 We should start trying that.

848
00:45:38,900 --> 00:45:43,420
 We used to carry that feather, wasn't it, to tickle the genitals of his friends?

849
00:45:43,420 --> 00:45:44,420
 You can't be unhappy when you're laughing.

850
00:45:44,420 --> 00:45:50,060
 Apparently, they also use it to pinch their parents' genitals sometimes to get their attention.

851
00:45:50,060 --> 00:45:55,580
 I read somewhere there's an archive of African elephants' trunk uses and there are more than

852
00:45:55,580 --> 00:45:58,420
 250 separate uses for their trunks.

853
00:45:58,420 --> 00:45:59,420
 No.

854
00:45:59,420 --> 00:46:02,900
 Which sounds like one of those, you know, difficult interview questions.

855
00:46:02,900 --> 00:46:05,140
 How many uses can you think of for a trunk?

856
00:46:05,140 --> 00:46:09,580
 But one of them was named as kids getting their mum's attention by pinching her genitals.

857
00:46:09,580 --> 00:46:10,580
 Or dad.

858
00:46:10,580 --> 00:46:11,580
 Wow.

859
00:46:11,580 --> 00:46:12,580
 Wow.

860
00:46:12,580 --> 00:46:13,580
 Do you know how you take an elephant's temperature?

861
00:46:13,580 --> 00:46:15,900
 Sounds like the start of a joke.

862
00:46:15,900 --> 00:46:16,900
 Yeah.

863
00:46:16,900 --> 00:46:17,900
 The bum-bum.

864
00:46:17,900 --> 00:46:20,580
 Tickle its genitals.

865
00:46:20,580 --> 00:46:27,300
 So it is a thermometer and it is up the bum, but weirdly, the thermometer is a normal sized

866
00:46:27,300 --> 00:46:28,300
 one.

867
00:46:28,300 --> 00:46:29,300
 Oh.

868
00:46:29,300 --> 00:46:32,020
 Because you'd think it would be a comical oversized elephant one.

869
00:46:32,020 --> 00:46:34,420
 You'd think it wouldn't touch the sides, would you?

870
00:46:34,420 --> 00:46:35,420
 Yeah.

871
00:46:35,420 --> 00:46:36,420
 Exactly.

872
00:46:36,420 --> 00:46:41,780
 But you've got to keep your arm there for four minutes and it could be really important

873
00:46:41,780 --> 00:46:43,140
 to assess the elephant's health as well.

874
00:46:43,140 --> 00:46:44,140
 Right.

875
00:46:44,140 --> 00:46:45,140
 But that's a long time.

876
00:46:45,140 --> 00:46:46,140
 Yeah.

877
00:46:46,140 --> 00:46:49,140
 Have we then been using unnecessarily large thermometers?

878
00:46:49,140 --> 00:46:52,500
 That's a great point.

879
00:46:52,500 --> 00:46:56,540
 That does imply that humans should be able to use one the size of a blade of grass.

880
00:46:56,540 --> 00:46:57,540
 Yeah.

881
00:46:57,540 --> 00:46:58,540
 You're absolutely right.

882
00:46:58,540 --> 00:46:59,540
 It does.

883
00:46:59,540 --> 00:47:00,540
 It doesn't matter.

884
00:47:00,540 --> 00:47:04,860
 Elephant no such thing as a fish podcast where they're going, "Do you know humans use thermometers

885
00:47:04,860 --> 00:47:06,340
 the same size as us?"

886
00:47:06,340 --> 00:47:07,340
 It's not that.

887
00:47:07,340 --> 00:47:09,860
 Because you'd think they'd be the size of a little drawing fin.

888
00:47:09,860 --> 00:47:14,980
 It would be the equivalent of me shoving a telegraph pole up my arse.

889
00:47:14,980 --> 00:47:20,420
 But people have been studying this since 1936.

890
00:47:20,420 --> 00:47:24,220
 I found a scientific paper on elephant body temperatures which said the method used in

891
00:47:24,220 --> 00:47:28,580
 India is to have a Mahut, an elephant keeper, holding a thermometer in his hand, insert

892
00:47:28,580 --> 00:47:33,420
 his well-lubricated arm into the capacious rectum after first removing several of the

893
00:47:33,420 --> 00:47:35,300
 huge balls of feces.

894
00:47:35,300 --> 00:47:39,220
 I think, by the way, if we call out James for having used waterslide material, we have

895
00:47:39,220 --> 00:47:45,820
 to call Andy up for using thermometric material about six weeks ago.

896
00:47:45,820 --> 00:47:50,140
 Female Asian elephants have exactly the same sex pheromones as moths.

897
00:47:50,140 --> 00:47:52,460
 Do they ever get confused?

898
00:47:52,460 --> 00:47:55,100
 That must mean there's some very confusing couplings.

899
00:47:55,100 --> 00:47:56,100
 Yeah.

900
00:47:56,100 --> 00:47:57,100
 You wouldn't think so, right?

901
00:47:57,100 --> 00:48:05,260
 It would be a surprisingly heavy knock at the door, the moth looks up.

902
00:48:05,260 --> 00:48:08,220
 The other way round, I guess, right?

903
00:48:08,220 --> 00:48:10,820
 This is in a brilliant book by Tristan Wyatt.

904
00:48:10,820 --> 00:48:15,180
 He actually says in his book, "Apart from the mating difficulties should they try, male

905
00:48:15,180 --> 00:48:19,180
 moths are unlikely to be attracted to female elephants."

906
00:48:19,180 --> 00:48:23,660
 The reason being that actually a moth pheromone is usually a couple of different pheromones

907
00:48:23,660 --> 00:48:26,700
 together, one of which is this elephant pheromone.

908
00:48:26,700 --> 00:48:29,500
 But without the secondary pheromone, you're probably not.

909
00:48:29,500 --> 00:48:34,100
 You're going to think that the elephant is a bit like a sexy moth, but not exactly like

910
00:48:34,100 --> 00:48:35,500
 a sexy moth.

911
00:48:35,500 --> 00:48:40,300
 Is that the only thing that's holding them back?

912
00:48:40,300 --> 00:48:43,620
 If they're that stupid, they would genuinely get confused.

913
00:48:43,620 --> 00:48:48,940
 Well, I'm just thinking, if a normal tiny thermometer works in an elephant's anus, there

914
00:48:48,940 --> 00:48:53,540
 may be a moth penis works in an elephant vagina.

915
00:48:53,540 --> 00:48:57,780
 It's the ultimate, you don't look like your Tinder profile picture.

916
00:48:57,780 --> 00:49:00,740
 God, imagine the crossbreed.

917
00:49:00,740 --> 00:49:05,480
 So these elephants can down five pints in under a second.

918
00:49:05,480 --> 00:49:11,180
 What do you think is the fastest time that a human can down a pint of liquid?

919
00:49:11,180 --> 00:49:14,280
 A pint of liquid.

920
00:49:14,280 --> 00:49:16,980
 I mean, you see these people drinking a pint, don't you, where they just open their throat

921
00:49:16,980 --> 00:49:17,980
 and it just goes.

922
00:49:17,980 --> 00:49:18,980
 Five seconds, I would say.

923
00:49:18,980 --> 00:49:19,980
 Five seconds is done.

924
00:49:19,980 --> 00:49:20,980
 You've seen me.

925
00:49:20,980 --> 00:49:24,700
 You've seen me do it in less than that.

926
00:49:24,700 --> 00:49:27,740
 One, one, one second, one point, two seconds.

927
00:49:27,740 --> 00:49:32,260
 Five seconds is like average first point drinking time.

928
00:49:32,260 --> 00:49:33,260
 Last order's at the bar.

929
00:49:33,260 --> 00:49:34,260
 Last order.

930
00:49:34,260 --> 00:49:35,260
 Oh, another one.

931
00:49:35,260 --> 00:49:38,220
 I'll say two seconds.

932
00:49:38,220 --> 00:49:40,580
 Well, yeah, it's in between those two.

933
00:49:40,580 --> 00:49:43,220
 It's 1.75 seconds.

934
00:49:43,220 --> 00:49:49,780
 And this was achieved by Tim Cocker, who was a DJ for XFM and is now a DJ for Virgin Radio.

935
00:49:49,780 --> 00:49:55,820
 And I spoke to Mr. Cocker about this and asked him a few questions about his amazing skill

936
00:49:55,820 --> 00:49:59,180
 at being able to down drinks.

937
00:49:59,180 --> 00:50:04,820
 So he reckons it was 1.75 seconds and it was done on this breakfast show that he was presenting.

938
00:50:04,820 --> 00:50:09,540
 But the time began from when he picked up the glass and it stopped when he put the glass

939
00:50:09,540 --> 00:50:10,540
 down.

940
00:50:10,540 --> 00:50:12,180
 So actually he did it much quicker than that.

941
00:50:12,180 --> 00:50:15,780
 So Anna's 1.2 second or one second might be quite close, I think.

942
00:50:15,780 --> 00:50:17,900
 And I asked him how he discovered the skill.

943
00:50:17,900 --> 00:50:22,900
 He said it was during a drinking game at Exeter University when he was just doing that and

944
00:50:22,900 --> 00:50:26,260
 suddenly everyone turned around and went, "What the hell has just happened over there?"

945
00:50:26,260 --> 00:50:31,540
 But he could literally, if he was on a night out, walk through a bar, pass a table and

946
00:50:31,540 --> 00:50:35,620
 say to someone with a full pint, "Hey, what an amazing painting on the wall."

947
00:50:35,620 --> 00:50:40,260
 They'd turn around for two seconds, turn back, and there's just an empty pint glass

948
00:50:40,260 --> 00:50:41,820
 and he walks to the next table.

949
00:50:41,820 --> 00:50:44,540
 He said, "Oh, England have just kicked a goal."

950
00:50:44,540 --> 00:50:45,540
 They turn.

951
00:50:45,540 --> 00:50:46,540
 Boom.

952
00:50:46,540 --> 00:50:50,300
 They have a whole night in 30 seconds.

953
00:50:50,300 --> 00:50:54,300
 What pubs are you going to where you say, "That's a nice painting on the wall for clubs?"

954
00:50:54,300 --> 00:50:56,340
 Well, here's an interesting thing.

955
00:50:56,340 --> 00:51:00,740
 The study that I was talking about for this fact, when they were looking into elephants

956
00:51:00,740 --> 00:51:06,980
 sucking in all of this liquid into their trunk in such speeds, they found that more liquid

957
00:51:06,980 --> 00:51:13,020
 was going into the trunk than was available in terms of space that the trunk had.

958
00:51:13,020 --> 00:51:14,020
 Just way more liquid.

959
00:51:14,020 --> 00:51:15,540
 And they're going, "What's going on there?"

960
00:51:15,540 --> 00:51:20,860
 So they did an ultrasound on an elephant as it was drinking the liquid and they found

961
00:51:20,860 --> 00:51:27,180
 that the elephant was dilating the nostrils inside the trunk and they were expanding it

962
00:51:27,180 --> 00:51:30,420
 to a total volume of up to 64%.

963
00:51:30,420 --> 00:51:32,500
 So its trunk gets bigger as it drinks.

964
00:51:32,500 --> 00:51:33,500
 Exactly.

965
00:51:33,500 --> 00:51:41,340
 And I'm wondering if your buddy there is expanding his throat to a much larger size to allow for

966
00:51:41,340 --> 00:51:45,860
 it to just go down like pouring a pint into a well basically.

967
00:51:45,860 --> 00:51:46,860
 Maybe.

968
00:51:46,860 --> 00:51:47,860
 Yeah.

969
00:51:47,860 --> 00:51:48,860
 Maybe.

970
00:51:48,860 --> 00:51:50,820
 Do you think it looks like a giant Adam's apple just sort of appears and then disappears

971
00:51:50,820 --> 00:51:52,420
 and they're doing it then?

972
00:51:52,420 --> 00:51:57,260
 He's not a cartoon character guys, he's a suspected DJ.

973
00:51:57,260 --> 00:52:02,180
 I have another food record or two or consumption, rate of consumption record.

974
00:52:02,180 --> 00:52:09,100
 There was a story that broke quite recently and it was that during lockdown a man called

975
00:52:09,100 --> 00:52:13,300
 Declan Evans from Lincoln broke the world record for the fastest time to drink a Capri

976
00:52:13,300 --> 00:52:14,300
 Sun.

977
00:52:14,300 --> 00:52:21,660
 Now they're probably only around 250 milliliters or 3 milliliters or something like that.

978
00:52:21,660 --> 00:52:22,820
 So half the size I reckon.

979
00:52:22,820 --> 00:52:23,820
 Yeah.

980
00:52:23,820 --> 00:52:25,420
 And you're drinking through a straw, aren't you, as well?

981
00:52:25,420 --> 00:52:26,820
 Well, this is the problem.

982
00:52:26,820 --> 00:52:28,660
 The rules are very stringent.

983
00:52:28,660 --> 00:52:32,380
 You need to drink an unmodified 200 mil Capri Sun pouch.

984
00:52:32,380 --> 00:52:37,780
 The straw still has to be not only stuck to the side but also still in the plastic.

985
00:52:37,780 --> 00:52:42,540
 So it's actually, the record for drinking a Capri Sun is much longer than the record

986
00:52:42,540 --> 00:52:43,540
 for drinking a pint.

987
00:52:43,540 --> 00:52:46,020
 It's like by an order of 10.

988
00:52:46,020 --> 00:52:47,020
 Wow.

989
00:52:47,020 --> 00:52:48,020
 By an order of magnitude.

990
00:52:48,020 --> 00:52:49,020
 Yeah.

991
00:52:49,020 --> 00:52:50,020
 So the rules.

992
00:52:50,020 --> 00:52:52,380
 More than 10 seconds, really?

993
00:52:52,380 --> 00:52:53,380
 Yeah.

994
00:52:53,380 --> 00:52:54,380
 So he broke it.

995
00:52:54,380 --> 00:52:59,060
 It actually got re-broken within a month by a lady called Leah Schuttkiver who managed

996
00:52:59,060 --> 00:53:01,220
 it in 15.71 seconds.

997
00:53:01,220 --> 00:53:03,140
 That I believe is the current world record.

998
00:53:03,140 --> 00:53:04,140
 Really?

999
00:53:04,140 --> 00:53:05,140
 The rules are so strict though.

1000
00:53:05,140 --> 00:53:06,140
 Listen to this.

1001
00:53:06,140 --> 00:53:10,460
 The two and a half millilitres may still be found in the pouch after it is normally drunk.

1002
00:53:10,460 --> 00:53:16,100
 Once the attempt has ended, the contents of the pouch must be poured into a 2.5 mil measuring

1003
00:53:16,100 --> 00:53:18,180
 spoon and you're filming all of this.

1004
00:53:18,180 --> 00:53:21,220
 If any liquid overflows, the attempt will be disqualified.

1005
00:53:21,220 --> 00:53:22,220
 Yeah.

1006
00:53:22,220 --> 00:53:23,220
 That's...

1007
00:53:23,220 --> 00:53:24,220
 It's strict.

1008
00:53:24,220 --> 00:53:25,220
 That's very strict.

1009
00:53:25,220 --> 00:53:28,260
 How crazy that the rules are more strict than posting an eagle to the National Eagle

1010
00:53:28,260 --> 00:53:46,220
 for a positive treatment.

1011
00:53:46,220 --> 00:53:48,460
 I'm on that Shriverland, Andy.

1012
00:53:48,460 --> 00:53:49,460
 At Andrew Hunter M.

1013
00:53:49,460 --> 00:53:50,460
 James.

1014
00:53:50,460 --> 00:53:51,460
 At James Harkin.

1015
00:53:51,460 --> 00:53:52,460
 And Anna.

1016
00:53:52,460 --> 00:53:53,860
 You can email podcast@qi.com.

1017
00:53:53,860 --> 00:53:54,860
 Yep.

1018
00:53:54,860 --> 00:53:58,260
 You can go to our group account at no such thing or go to our website.

1019
00:53:58,260 --> 00:54:00,380
 No such thing as a fish.com.

1020
00:54:00,380 --> 00:54:02,420
 It is booming on there at the moment.

1021
00:54:02,420 --> 00:54:03,980
 All of our previous episodes were up there.

1022
00:54:03,980 --> 00:54:06,700
 We've got a massive tour coming up later this year.

1023
00:54:06,700 --> 00:54:07,700
 Check them out.

1024
00:54:07,700 --> 00:54:08,700
 See if we're coming to your town.

1025
00:54:08,700 --> 00:54:09,700
 Do come along.

1026
00:54:09,700 --> 00:54:12,140
 We have an amazing time on tour and we'd love to see you there.

1027
00:54:12,140 --> 00:54:14,260
 We also have a link to our merch.

1028
00:54:14,260 --> 00:54:15,460
 There's all the stuff you need from us.

1029
00:54:15,460 --> 00:54:16,940
 You can even see our faces there.

1030
00:54:16,940 --> 00:54:17,940
 Check them out.

1031
00:54:17,940 --> 00:54:18,940
 They look nice.

1032
00:54:18,940 --> 00:54:19,940
 Okay.

1033
00:54:19,940 --> 00:54:21,260
 We'll be back again next week with another episode.

1034
00:54:21,260 --> 00:54:22,260
 We'll see you then.

1035
00:54:22,260 --> 00:54:22,780
 Goodbye.
