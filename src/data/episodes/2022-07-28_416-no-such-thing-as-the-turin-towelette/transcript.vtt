00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580
 (upbeat music)

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:18.800
 - Hello, and welcome to another episode

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:20.920
 of No Such Thing as a Fish,

00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:25.920
 a weekly podcast this week coming to you live from Dublin.

00:00:27.280 --> 00:00:30.020
 (crowd cheering)

00:00:30.020 --> 00:00:34.760
 My name is Dan Schreiber.

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:38.080
 I am sitting here with Anna Tyshinski,

00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:42.640
 Azure Hunts of Murray, and Jayne Markin.

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:46.960
 And once again, we have gathered around that microphone

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:50.400
 with our four favorite facts of the last seven days.

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:55.400
 And in that particular honor, here we go!

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:58.140
 (crowd cheering)

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:04.680
 Okay, calm the fuck down, everyone.

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:11.120
 Starting with fact number one, and that is James.

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:15.200
 Okay, my fact this week is that in 1954,

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:18.560
 it became illegal to bathe completely naked

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:19.840
 in East Germany.

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:22.240
 So nature has started going to the beach,

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:24.100
 wearing nothing but a tie.

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:26.860
 (crowd laughing)

00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:33.100
 So just before World War II,

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:34.240
 we've actually said this before,

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:37.220
 Hitler banned natureism in the Nazi government,

00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:39.440
 but almost immediately unbanded

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:41.500
 because it was so unpopular.

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:45.900
 And then it kind of became part of the Nazi tradition

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:48.720
 that we're gonna allow people to be naked

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:51.180
 if they want to be nudists if they want.

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:54.020
 And so when East Germany became a country,

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:55.940
 and they wanted to be away from the fascism

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:58.420
 with the communists, they saw natureism

00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:01.380
 as like this fascist symbol from the past.

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:03.300
 And so they decided to ban it.

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:05.260
 And there's a whole load of stories

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:07.300
 about what was happening with the natureists

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:09.820
 who just wanted to get along with the get-off.

00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:11.900
 And the East German police really

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:13.420
 were not happy about it at all.

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:15.460
 - That's rough.

00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:18.100
 Nudity being taken down by fascism.

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:21.340
 Unless you've got a swastika tattooed onto your penis,

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:23.860
 then I don't think they're related.

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:25.420
 It's not budged, it's just they are.

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:27.420
 - Oh my God, I imagine that.

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:29.900
 'Cause really, by the time you see the swastika

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:32.420
 on the penis, it's almost too late, isn't it?

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:34.540
 (laughing)

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:35.380
 - Yeah.

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:37.260
 - And one of the reasons why the East Germans

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:39.940
 didn't like natureism is because of the main guy

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:42.340
 who was in charge of German natureism.

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:45.140
 He was like the leading light of German natureism, really.

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:46.780
 He was called Adolf Koch.

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:52.660
 Adolf Koch was an anti-drinking, anti-smoking,

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:55.780
 pro-homosexuality, pro-sex outside marriage.

00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:56.700
 He was a pacifist.

00:02:56.700 --> 00:02:59.980
 He was very modern-day woke.

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:01.820
 But obviously the communists

00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:03.340
 did not like him one little bit.

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:05.460
 And so he was almost like the face,

00:03:05.460 --> 00:03:07.940
 I hope the face, of natureism.

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:09.540
 And they really didn't like him,

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:11.500
 and that was one of the reasons they stamped down on it.

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:12.420
 - But they couldn't, right?

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:16.300
 Because in the end, Germany is this strange anomaly

00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:19.740
 of country, which I think makes them kind

00:03:19.740 --> 00:03:21.420
 of the only sane country, in a way,

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:23.540
 where they're all, not they're all,

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:25.740
 but more of them are much more comfortable

00:03:25.740 --> 00:03:29.100
 with natureism and nudity than any other countries.

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:31.420
 And it's going down a little bit.

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:33.500
 But yeah, and it was started in Germany

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:34.700
 at the end of the 19th century.

00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:38.100
 It was by this guy called Karl Diefenbach,

00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:41.140
 who moved himself and his entire family,

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:42.380
 and I'd like to know what they thought of this,

00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:47.380
 into an abandoned quarry where he lived with them naked.

00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:50.260
 And he was taken to court,

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:53.380
 and then I think he was for being naked.

00:03:53.380 --> 00:03:55.980
 And then people agreed that it was okay.

00:03:55.980 --> 00:03:57.140
 And the thing then was,

00:03:57.140 --> 00:03:59.740
 it was to emulate ancient Greek sculptures,

00:03:59.740 --> 00:04:02.700
 which were considered so beautiful and shapely.

00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:05.780
 And so people would come to nudist parties

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:07.980
 in the poses of Greek sculptures.

00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:09.260
 And then they'd sort of paint each other

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:10.780
 and compliment each other.

00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:12.220
 And sounds lovely.

00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:13.220
 - Yeah, right. - It is.

00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:14.260
 - Wait, sorry, hang on.

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:18.380
 Their costume was coming in the pose of a Greek later.

00:04:18.380 --> 00:04:19.860
 - You know, like that discus thrower?

00:04:19.860 --> 00:04:20.700
 You could have a discus.

00:04:20.700 --> 00:04:22.860
 - Yeah, but you can't arrive at a party

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:24.340
 just holding a position.

00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:26.020
 (laughing)

00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:27.380
 - You have to be wheeled in.

00:04:27.380 --> 00:04:28.340
 - Yeah, exactly.

00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:29.820
 (laughing)

00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:32.460
 That's a lot of commitment to a party as well, I'd say.

00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:35.340
 You're naked and you're just not moving the entire party.

00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:38.540
 - Germany does have this thing of being quite passionate

00:04:38.540 --> 00:04:40.860
 about the freikorpo cultio,

00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:42.300
 which means free body culture.

00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:43.380
 And it's a really big thing there.

00:04:43.380 --> 00:04:45.260
 So there was a thing about 20 years ago

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:48.340
 on the, there was a resort on the island of RÃ¼gen.

00:04:48.340 --> 00:04:50.340
 And there was a bit of the beach

00:04:50.340 --> 00:04:52.380
 that was a nudist bit of the beach.

00:04:52.380 --> 00:04:53.220
 And there was a bit,

00:04:53.220 --> 00:04:55.060
 which was the non-nudist bit of the beach.

00:04:55.060 --> 00:04:58.100
 And the resort hired what they called

00:04:58.100 --> 00:04:59.420
 (speaking in foreign language)

00:04:59.420 --> 00:05:01.300
 or Panties Police.

00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:06.060
 Who, their job was to ask people who were nudists

00:05:06.060 --> 00:05:08.780
 who had strayed into the clothes section of the beach

00:05:08.780 --> 00:05:11.260
 to please go back to the nudist section of the beach.

00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:13.620
 But their other job was to approach clothes people

00:05:13.620 --> 00:05:15.140
 in the nudist section of the beach

00:05:15.140 --> 00:05:17.420
 and say, get them off.

00:05:17.420 --> 00:05:18.260
 (laughing)

00:05:18.260 --> 00:05:19.500
 - Oh man.

00:05:19.500 --> 00:05:21.500
 Surely they'd say go back to the clothes section.

00:05:21.500 --> 00:05:23.780
 - I think they basically gave them a choice.

00:05:23.780 --> 00:05:25.940
 They said, you can keep that or you can stay here,

00:05:25.940 --> 00:05:26.940
 but you can't do both.

00:05:26.940 --> 00:05:27.780
 - That's amazing.

00:05:27.780 --> 00:05:28.620
 - Yeah.

00:05:28.620 --> 00:05:29.460
 - Wasn't there a story,

00:05:29.460 --> 00:05:30.780
 I haven't written this down so I don't know the details,

00:05:30.780 --> 00:05:32.580
 but wasn't there a story of someone robbing

00:05:32.580 --> 00:05:34.180
 either a shop or a bank?

00:05:34.180 --> 00:05:36.660
 And as they ran out, they leapt over a fence

00:05:36.660 --> 00:05:38.620
 to try and integrate with the people around there,

00:05:38.620 --> 00:05:39.740
 but it was a nudist camp.

00:05:39.740 --> 00:05:40.580
 (laughing)

00:05:40.580 --> 00:05:43.700
 And the police came in, it spotted him immediately,

00:05:43.700 --> 00:05:44.780
 only doing the clothes on.

00:05:44.780 --> 00:05:46.300
 - In nudist resorts, the shoplifting

00:05:46.300 --> 00:05:47.860
 is genuinely very low.

00:05:47.860 --> 00:05:50.460
 As in, because where are you gonna put it?

00:05:50.460 --> 00:05:53.380
 - You're only gonna hide things that are very thin.

00:05:53.380 --> 00:05:54.220
 - Absolutely.

00:05:54.220 --> 00:05:55.820
 (laughing)

00:05:55.820 --> 00:05:57.260
 You can steal some cigarette papers,

00:05:57.260 --> 00:05:58.980
 but that's it, really.

00:05:58.980 --> 00:06:00.580
 - And no one's smoking those cigarettes.

00:06:00.580 --> 00:06:03.300
 (laughing)

00:06:03.300 --> 00:06:06.540
 That's like Cape Dagde, which is a French holiday resort.

00:06:06.540 --> 00:06:07.380
 - Yeah.

00:06:07.380 --> 00:06:10.140
 - Which I didn't know about, but it's a full on naked town.

00:06:10.140 --> 00:06:13.540
 And in the summer, the population reaches 40,000,

00:06:13.540 --> 00:06:15.860
 which I guess is just mostly visitors.

00:06:15.860 --> 00:06:18.820
 But it's quite odd because the visitors

00:06:18.820 --> 00:06:20.740
 don't wear any clothes, so everyone's naked,

00:06:20.740 --> 00:06:22.900
 but there are lots of shops and the post office

00:06:22.900 --> 00:06:24.300
 and banks and stuff like that.

00:06:24.300 --> 00:06:26.420
 And all the people who are serving them

00:06:26.420 --> 00:06:28.580
 in those places are fully clothed.

00:06:28.580 --> 00:06:32.100
 So it's very surreal, like lots of naked customers,

00:06:32.100 --> 00:06:34.660
 and they're just in uniform bank teller,

00:06:34.660 --> 00:06:38.220
 giving them their money that they can't keep anywhere.

00:06:38.220 --> 00:06:42.260
 But yeah, there's very little crime,

00:06:42.260 --> 00:06:44.220
 and they refer to the closed people

00:06:44.220 --> 00:06:47.500
 that you can see on the opposite bank as textiles.

00:06:47.500 --> 00:06:49.820
 (laughing)

00:06:49.820 --> 00:06:51.420
 - That plays Cape Dagde.

00:06:51.420 --> 00:06:53.620
 I think it's having a bit of an identity crisis

00:06:53.620 --> 00:06:55.820
 at the moment, because it's turned into a very sexy place.

00:06:55.820 --> 00:06:58.500
 And swingers are starting to turn up.

00:06:58.500 --> 00:07:01.020
 And the nudists are a bit put out about this,

00:07:01.020 --> 00:07:05.460
 because, A, naturism is not about sex or sexiness,

00:07:05.460 --> 00:07:09.660
 it's about being natural and feeling your body in nature.

00:07:09.660 --> 00:07:11.300
 - I don't think it's a completely

00:07:11.300 --> 00:07:14.100
 incomplete Venn diagram, though, is there?

00:07:14.100 --> 00:07:15.260
 - Well, yeah, this is the thing.

00:07:15.260 --> 00:07:17.700
 So the naturists genuinely are saying we're not swingers,

00:07:17.700 --> 00:07:18.540
 and the swingers are turning up,

00:07:18.540 --> 00:07:19.820
 but the other thing is that the swingers turn up

00:07:19.820 --> 00:07:22.620
 and wear sexy clothes, and the naturists hate this.

00:07:22.620 --> 00:07:24.060
 - Oh, really? - Yeah.

00:07:24.060 --> 00:07:25.580
 - Yeah, so when we're saying most of the shops

00:07:25.580 --> 00:07:27.100
 that are weirded clothes shops,

00:07:27.100 --> 00:07:30.060
 but they're selling kind of S&M fetish.

00:07:30.060 --> 00:07:31.900
 - Excellent chat. - That sort of stuff.

00:07:31.900 --> 00:07:33.140
 - Exactly. - Yeah.

00:07:33.140 --> 00:07:36.020
 - Which absolutely is not what naturism is, really.

00:07:36.020 --> 00:07:38.340
 It's about kind of innocence and being freed

00:07:38.340 --> 00:07:41.020
 from these constraints of, anyway,

00:07:41.020 --> 00:07:43.620
 you know, look, I've got a speech I'm giving afterwards.

00:07:43.620 --> 00:07:46.540
 (laughing)

00:07:46.540 --> 00:07:47.900
 - Can I ask a very stupid question?

00:07:47.900 --> 00:07:49.020
 This is a genuinely stupid question,

00:07:49.020 --> 00:07:50.700
 but if you were a naturist,

00:07:50.700 --> 00:07:53.740
 would seeing someone in clothes

00:07:53.740 --> 00:07:57.060
 be the equivalent of a sexy magazine?

00:07:57.060 --> 00:08:01.020
 - I think... - Is the opposite of what...

00:08:01.020 --> 00:08:01.980
 (laughing)

00:08:01.980 --> 00:08:04.780
 - Is like their playboy just, I don't know.

00:08:04.780 --> 00:08:06.100
 - They go to clubs, actually,

00:08:06.100 --> 00:08:08.740
 and they watch people wearing heavy tweeds

00:08:08.740 --> 00:08:09.900
 dance around the pole.

00:08:09.900 --> 00:08:12.060
 (laughing)

00:08:12.060 --> 00:08:13.820
 - There was a bit of a moral panic

00:08:13.820 --> 00:08:15.380
 back in the East German days,

00:08:15.380 --> 00:08:16.300
 what I'm talking about now.

00:08:16.300 --> 00:08:20.380
 So there was a moral panic that people who were clothed

00:08:20.380 --> 00:08:23.180
 and were walking past the German naturists

00:08:23.180 --> 00:08:25.020
 were having their clothes stolen

00:08:25.020 --> 00:08:27.460
 and being thrown into the sea.

00:08:27.460 --> 00:08:28.540
 And there were a few reports,

00:08:28.540 --> 00:08:30.060
 and we think it probably didn't happen,

00:08:30.060 --> 00:08:32.260
 but they were just fake reports that it was happening.

00:08:32.260 --> 00:08:33.740
 - Wait, clothed people?

00:08:33.740 --> 00:08:35.300
 - So you're a normal clothed person,

00:08:35.300 --> 00:08:37.220
 just going about your business in Germany.

00:08:37.220 --> 00:08:39.620
 Aye, aye, aye, aye, aye.

00:08:39.620 --> 00:08:42.020
 And then suddenly a load of naked people come along,

00:08:42.020 --> 00:08:43.460
 they grab all of your clothes,

00:08:43.460 --> 00:08:44.620
 they rip them off and say,

00:08:44.620 --> 00:08:45.900
 "This is a naked place,"

00:08:45.900 --> 00:08:48.100
 and then they throw you in the sea.

00:08:48.100 --> 00:08:50.020
 - Wow. - They throw you in the sea.

00:08:50.020 --> 00:08:51.220
 - Yeah.

00:08:51.220 --> 00:08:52.780
 Genuinely, that was one of the reasons

00:08:52.780 --> 00:08:53.780
 why they tried to panic,

00:08:53.780 --> 00:08:55.540
 because this kind of moral panic came,

00:08:55.540 --> 00:08:57.460
 and it was in the newspapers that this was happening,

00:08:57.460 --> 00:08:58.860
 and everyone's like, "Oh, my God,

00:08:58.860 --> 00:09:00.860
 "I'm just going to be walking down the streets in Berlin

00:09:00.860 --> 00:09:02.300
 "and people are going to rip my clothes off.

00:09:02.300 --> 00:09:04.180
 "We need to stop these naturists now."

00:09:04.180 --> 00:09:05.500
 - Good identity parades you'd have

00:09:05.500 --> 00:09:07.620
 at the end of all that, wouldn't you?

00:09:07.620 --> 00:09:09.700
 I recognise that swastika right there.

00:09:09.700 --> 00:09:13.420
 Can you ask him to do the salute?

00:09:13.420 --> 00:09:18.060
 - Oh, my God.

00:09:18.060 --> 00:09:22.060
 - There was some small justification to being paranoid

00:09:22.060 --> 00:09:25.300
 about it being co-opted by well-perverts.

00:09:25.300 --> 00:09:27.940
 So in the 1930s, when the movement started to take off,

00:09:27.940 --> 00:09:29.660
 there were fewer than 10,000 members

00:09:29.660 --> 00:09:32.580
 of the Natureism Society in the UK,

00:09:32.580 --> 00:09:36.340
 but the second issue of Sunbathing Review,

00:09:36.340 --> 00:09:39.140
 which was the euphemistic name for the nudist magazine,

00:09:39.140 --> 00:09:41.300
 sold 50,000 copies,

00:09:41.300 --> 00:09:42.700
 and there was a small suspicion

00:09:42.700 --> 00:09:44.260
 that some of the people buying that

00:09:44.260 --> 00:09:45.540
 were not actually nudists,

00:09:45.540 --> 00:09:47.980
 they just wanted to see loads of naked people,

00:09:47.980 --> 00:09:48.940
 which makes sense.

00:09:48.940 --> 00:09:50.500
 And photographers for that magazine

00:09:50.500 --> 00:09:52.500
 used to ship models to nudist beaches,

00:09:52.500 --> 00:09:54.700
 take photographs of them, and then leave.

00:09:54.700 --> 00:09:56.220
 - But that was a big thing, wasn't it?

00:09:56.220 --> 00:09:57.820
 So around the world now,

00:09:57.820 --> 00:10:00.380
 the article that I read, there may be more now,

00:10:00.380 --> 00:10:04.020
 but there's four nudist libraries in the world today.

00:10:04.020 --> 00:10:04.860
 - Really?

00:10:04.860 --> 00:10:07.260
 - So a nudist library, it's a combination of two things.

00:10:07.260 --> 00:10:09.660
 One is, it's a library about nudity.

00:10:09.660 --> 00:10:12.700
 So it's just got magazines, it's got books,

00:10:12.700 --> 00:10:14.020
 anything that is about nudity.

00:10:14.020 --> 00:10:16.460
 So the magazines that they have are not Playboy

00:10:16.460 --> 00:10:17.860
 or anything to do with sexuality,

00:10:17.860 --> 00:10:19.180
 but in the '60s and '70s,

00:10:19.180 --> 00:10:21.500
 there was a boom when a law got taken down

00:10:21.500 --> 00:10:24.500
 to say that nakedness could be represented in magazines,

00:10:24.500 --> 00:10:27.660
 and a lot of magazines with nudity were printed,

00:10:27.660 --> 00:10:30.940
 and so this is a library that has all of that,

00:10:30.940 --> 00:10:33.420
 but you are allowed to be naked in it as well.

00:10:33.420 --> 00:10:36.540
 It's a nudist, nudist library.

00:10:36.540 --> 00:10:38.380
 - Here's one thing that happens to nudists.

00:10:38.380 --> 00:10:39.820
 This is according to Stefan Duchenne,

00:10:39.820 --> 00:10:41.860
 who is the new co-president

00:10:41.860 --> 00:10:44.060
 of the International Nudism Federation.

00:10:44.060 --> 00:10:45.700
 He was interviewed recently about nudism,

00:10:45.700 --> 00:10:47.540
 and he said that one thing you can get

00:10:47.540 --> 00:10:52.420
 if you're a nudist is you get phantom clothes, okay?

00:10:52.420 --> 00:10:54.340
 He said after decades of...

00:10:54.340 --> 00:10:55.180
 This is the article.

00:10:55.180 --> 00:10:57.380
 After decades of living as a naturist,

00:10:57.380 --> 00:10:59.540
 Duchenne still sometimes reaches to pull up

00:10:59.540 --> 00:11:02.620
 his non-existent pants after using the restroom.

00:11:02.620 --> 00:11:05.740
 - How was that? - Yeah, I see it.

00:11:05.740 --> 00:11:07.300
 I see that, that makes sense.

00:11:07.300 --> 00:11:08.380
 - Yeah. - Yeah.

00:11:08.380 --> 00:11:10.780
 - Do you know, so when I was looking at this fact,

00:11:10.780 --> 00:11:13.260
 I literally, I think I typed in something as simple

00:11:13.260 --> 00:11:17.060
 into Google to kick off as naturism history,

00:11:17.060 --> 00:11:21.300
 and one of the first results was naturist cleaners,

00:11:21.300 --> 00:11:26.260
 which is the UK's leading naturist nude cleaning service.

00:11:26.260 --> 00:11:27.740
 I cannot believe this exists,

00:11:27.740 --> 00:11:30.260
 so naked people come to clean your house,

00:11:30.260 --> 00:11:32.900
 and it's a professional cleaning service.

00:11:32.900 --> 00:11:35.540
 - I mean, I feel like I would have to hire another cleaner

00:11:35.540 --> 00:11:37.860
 for whatever they'd start.

00:11:37.860 --> 00:11:42.100
 It's like, oh my God, no, no, no, don't sit there, don't sit there.

00:11:42.100 --> 00:11:44.180
 - They don't arrive at your door naked, though.

00:11:44.180 --> 00:11:45.020
 - That's a really good question.

00:11:45.020 --> 00:11:46.620
 I don't know if they do,

00:11:46.620 --> 00:11:48.260
 because you're not, that's illegal, isn't it?

00:11:48.260 --> 00:11:50.180
 So they must arrive in maybe a trench.

00:11:50.180 --> 00:11:51.020
 - It's not illegal, it's not illegal.

00:11:51.020 --> 00:11:51.860
 - It's not illegal. - It's not illegal.

00:11:51.860 --> 00:11:54.660
 - It is actually, it is here in Ireland.

00:11:54.660 --> 00:11:55.500
 - Is it? - In Nuttas.

00:11:55.500 --> 00:11:59.140
 - Yeah, Ireland hosted the 2014 34th

00:11:59.140 --> 00:12:00.620
 International Naturist Congress,

00:12:00.620 --> 00:12:03.420
 despite it being technically banned by law.

00:12:03.420 --> 00:12:04.820
 - Yeah. - You've proved.

00:12:04.820 --> 00:12:07.460
 - You have a series, a selection of secret coves

00:12:07.460 --> 00:12:11.900
 that Irish nudists go to, and it's all done...

00:12:11.900 --> 00:12:13.260
 - See you all after the show.

00:12:13.260 --> 00:12:14.580
 - Yeah.

00:12:14.580 --> 00:12:16.860
 - So is it, Andy, is it, if we were back in London,

00:12:16.860 --> 00:12:18.620
 is it legal for us to just walk around?

00:12:18.620 --> 00:12:20.180
 - It's legal. - According to the website

00:12:20.180 --> 00:12:23.900
 of the Great British Take-Off from last year,

00:12:23.900 --> 00:12:28.580
 they are very, very clear on the front page.

00:12:28.580 --> 00:12:30.740
 By the way, it's perfectly legal.

00:12:30.740 --> 00:12:33.340
 They said, "By all means, tell the neighbours,

00:12:33.340 --> 00:12:36.700
 "but there is no need to warn them, even if you're overlooked.

00:12:36.700 --> 00:12:38.660
 "So long as you are not revealing yourself

00:12:38.660 --> 00:12:41.700
 "with the intention of upsetting people, it's fine."

00:12:41.700 --> 00:12:44.220
 - Yeah, I was intending to delight people.

00:12:45.220 --> 00:12:47.260
 - Yeah, it's that, it's a great idea.

00:12:47.260 --> 00:12:49.780
 - By the way, the Great British Take-Off, last year's,

00:12:49.780 --> 00:12:51.580
 they gave you some ideas of what you could do.

00:12:51.580 --> 00:12:54.220
 They're basically saying, "Take your clothes off in your garden."

00:12:54.220 --> 00:12:56.980
 They say, "You could sunbathe, read, sit in a hot tub,

00:12:56.980 --> 00:12:58.580
 "you can have a barbecue,

00:12:58.580 --> 00:13:01.300
 "you can kick a ball around through a frisbee."

00:13:01.300 --> 00:13:03.500
 - Do we kick the other ball around?

00:13:03.500 --> 00:13:08.540
 - "Do a jigsaw puzzle or listen to a podcast."

00:13:08.540 --> 00:13:10.020
 - Oh. - Oh.

00:13:10.020 --> 00:13:12.900
 - So if anyone's listening to this one in the net...

00:13:13.860 --> 00:13:17.180
 - Hi to you. - Take a photo right now and send it to us.

00:13:17.180 --> 00:13:19.500
 Right now. Do it.

00:13:19.500 --> 00:13:23.380
 - You can do that on the street, in a shop or whatever.

00:13:23.380 --> 00:13:26.380
 'Cause in your garden, obviously, I can do anything in my garden.

00:13:26.380 --> 00:13:28.180
 - In theory, it's legal.

00:13:28.180 --> 00:13:31.060
 - Tesco can't kick me out if I go there.

00:13:31.060 --> 00:13:33.940
 - Tesco's a private company. - I have a property there.

00:13:33.940 --> 00:13:35.540
 - I think the police would take an interest

00:13:35.540 --> 00:13:37.700
 if you'd just walk around the centre of town.

00:13:37.700 --> 00:13:39.780
 - Okay, but a hospital, not private,

00:13:39.780 --> 00:13:41.700
 NHS, publicly funded,

00:13:41.700 --> 00:13:44.780
 if I walk into a hospital but naked for no good reason,

00:13:44.780 --> 00:13:46.380
 they can't do anything about it.

00:13:46.380 --> 00:13:47.940
 - I think you'd have to wear a mask.

00:13:47.940 --> 00:13:49.420
 - Yeah.

00:13:49.420 --> 00:13:57.340
 - All right, look, we need to move on to our next fact.

00:13:57.340 --> 00:14:01.180
 It is time for fact number two, and that is...

00:14:01.180 --> 00:14:04.220
 - Andy. - My fact is that in 1998,

00:14:04.220 --> 00:14:08.860
 one-tenth of everything sold on eBay was a beanie baby.

00:14:10.580 --> 00:14:12.740
 - One-tenth, 10%... - Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

00:14:12.740 --> 00:14:14.580
 So if I bought a handbag,

00:14:14.580 --> 00:14:16.140
 one-tenth of it would be a beanie baby.

00:14:16.140 --> 00:14:17.260
 - That's right.

00:14:17.260 --> 00:14:18.660
 It would almost all be handbag,

00:14:18.660 --> 00:14:22.540
 but the strap and one of the pockets would be beamed.

00:14:22.540 --> 00:14:24.060
 This is a fact about beanie babies,

00:14:24.060 --> 00:14:27.700
 which, for a while, everyone was insane about.

00:14:27.700 --> 00:14:30.580
 But any younger listeners who missed out on the beanie baby craze,

00:14:30.580 --> 00:14:33.740
 they're just little stuffed bears full of plastic pellets.

00:14:33.740 --> 00:14:35.340
 That's it. - But that was the difference,

00:14:35.340 --> 00:14:38.540
 'cause every bear, prior to that, or any stuffed animal,

00:14:38.540 --> 00:14:41.460
 was completely stuffed to the hilt, and there was no bend.

00:14:41.460 --> 00:14:44.260
 But these little beans meant you could move it and you could do things.

00:14:44.260 --> 00:14:46.860
 - Yeah. - It was almost like it was alive, wasn't it,

00:14:46.860 --> 00:14:48.540
 'cause it could move around in different ways.

00:14:48.540 --> 00:14:51.140
 - Exactly. - It wasn't like it was alive.

00:14:51.140 --> 00:14:52.780
 It was just floppy.

00:14:52.780 --> 00:14:54.460
 It was a floppy teddy.

00:14:54.460 --> 00:14:56.500
 And to be fair, I hadn't actually realised,

00:14:56.500 --> 00:14:59.740
 until researching this fact, that that was the innovation.

00:14:59.740 --> 00:15:01.220
 You know, 'cause you grow up with beanie babies,

00:15:01.220 --> 00:15:02.900
 you think, "It's always been like this.

00:15:02.900 --> 00:15:05.780
 "Was there ever a time before this kind of vibe?"

00:15:05.780 --> 00:15:06.860
 But, yeah, before that,

00:15:06.860 --> 00:15:08.500
 teddy bears were just like...

00:15:08.500 --> 00:15:10.420
 - "Buff!" - In fairness.

00:15:10.420 --> 00:15:13.260
 - Constipated. - It's Iwana who invented them, right?

00:15:13.260 --> 00:15:14.260
 He was the guy who invented them.

00:15:14.260 --> 00:15:18.260
 He did say the whole idea was it looked real because it moved.

00:15:18.260 --> 00:15:21.300
 He thought these looked like actual bears.

00:15:21.300 --> 00:15:22.900
 - Yeah. - Mmm.

00:15:22.900 --> 00:15:24.300
 - So, in 1998,

00:15:24.300 --> 00:15:28.620
 64% of American adults owned at least one beanie baby.

00:15:28.620 --> 00:15:31.860
 - That is ridiculous. I saw that, and I didn't believe it.

00:15:31.860 --> 00:15:35.940
 In 1997, 64%, like you say, owned a beanie baby,

00:15:35.940 --> 00:15:40.260
 but 48% of Americans in 1997 believed in global warming.

00:15:40.260 --> 00:15:43.740
 - Uh-huh. - 53% trusted the media,

00:15:43.740 --> 00:15:47.420
 and 15% had a passport.

00:15:47.420 --> 00:15:50.420
 That's compared with 64% who had a beanie baby.

00:15:50.420 --> 00:15:51.540
 - Well, why... - Wow.

00:15:51.540 --> 00:15:52.660
 - You don't need to leave the country

00:15:52.660 --> 00:15:55.460
 when you've got these lovely beanie babies to identify you.

00:15:55.460 --> 00:15:57.740
 They started off, so, Tai Wano, who James just mentioned,

00:15:57.740 --> 00:15:59.660
 he was the man behind them,

00:15:59.660 --> 00:16:02.460
 and he had limited success with them, really.

00:16:02.460 --> 00:16:04.940
 He released a few, and they were doing all right.

00:16:04.940 --> 00:16:08.660
 And then, in 1995, two years after they launched,

00:16:08.660 --> 00:16:09.940
 he discontinued one of them.

00:16:09.940 --> 00:16:11.540
 There were problems with the factory

00:16:11.540 --> 00:16:13.100
 where they were being made overseas,

00:16:13.100 --> 00:16:15.740
 so he thought, "Right, sod it. We'll just kill off Lovey the Lamb."

00:16:15.740 --> 00:16:18.420
 And suddenly, people were desperate for Lovey the Lamb,

00:16:18.420 --> 00:16:19.740
 and he realised, "Oh, we're not going to say

00:16:19.740 --> 00:16:20.940
 "there are problems with the supplier.

00:16:20.940 --> 00:16:21.980
 "We can't get any of these."

00:16:21.980 --> 00:16:24.220
 - And we also won't say we killed it off.

00:16:24.220 --> 00:16:26.100
 - That's true. - It's true.

00:16:26.100 --> 00:16:27.020
 Well, yes, you're right.

00:16:27.020 --> 00:16:29.580
 He said, specifically, it's been retired,

00:16:29.580 --> 00:16:32.340
 so that suddenly created this huge demand for Lovey the Lamb,

00:16:32.340 --> 00:16:34.780
 and that became the entire business model behind the beanie baby.

00:16:34.780 --> 00:16:37.020
 There were hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of different models

00:16:37.020 --> 00:16:39.500
 by the end, which were being brought in, phased out.

00:16:39.500 --> 00:16:42.740
 It was incredibly hard to keep track of where they all were

00:16:42.740 --> 00:16:44.180
 and to have a full set.

00:16:44.180 --> 00:16:46.620
 But it's almost weirdly responsible, as well,

00:16:46.620 --> 00:16:48.460
 for the fact that we have eBay now,

00:16:48.460 --> 00:16:50.020
 as in we had eBay at the time,

00:16:50.020 --> 00:16:53.380
 but in 1998, eBay had 30 employees.

00:16:53.380 --> 00:16:55.340
 There were half a million users on it,

00:16:55.340 --> 00:16:59.340
 so the 10% of it was 10% of half a million users.

00:16:59.340 --> 00:17:00.700
 - What is that? - What is what?

00:17:00.700 --> 00:17:02.220
 10% of half a million.

00:17:02.220 --> 00:17:03.380
 (LAUGHTER)

00:17:03.380 --> 00:17:05.300
 That's not what you came for.

00:17:05.300 --> 00:17:07.260
 You didn't come for a maths test, Dan.

00:17:07.260 --> 00:17:09.020
 - Good point. - Go on, I apologise.

00:17:09.020 --> 00:17:11.020
 (LAUGHTER)

00:17:11.020 --> 00:17:12.180
 It's like your worst nightmare.

00:17:12.180 --> 00:17:14.620
 Someone give you a percentage question on stage

00:17:14.620 --> 00:17:15.460
 of one in 500 people.

00:17:15.460 --> 00:17:16.700
 Even though it's really easy,

00:17:16.700 --> 00:17:17.900
 because there's so many people here,

00:17:17.900 --> 00:17:19.780
 I can't work out what it is in my head.

00:17:19.780 --> 00:17:21.540
 (LAUGHTER)

00:17:21.540 --> 00:17:23.060
 It's a nightmare.

00:17:23.060 --> 00:17:25.580
 Well, you're not the CEO of eBay.

00:17:25.580 --> 00:17:27.620
 - You don't need to know these numbers. - Exactly.

00:17:27.620 --> 00:17:29.540
 Anna, you are one sick puffy.

00:17:29.540 --> 00:17:31.260
 (LAUGHTER)

00:17:31.260 --> 00:17:32.260
 It's 50,000.

00:17:32.260 --> 00:17:34.940
 - OK, let's move on. - Of course it's 50,000.

00:17:34.940 --> 00:17:36.420
 We all knew that.

00:17:36.420 --> 00:17:37.580
 (LAUGHTER)

00:17:37.580 --> 00:17:39.540
 But so... Thank you.

00:17:39.540 --> 00:17:41.380
 (LAUGHTER)

00:17:41.380 --> 00:17:43.620
 When eBay went public, here was the thing.

00:17:43.620 --> 00:17:47.140
 They were so desperately clinging on to this fad,

00:17:47.140 --> 00:17:49.980
 helping them, because that was bringing in such a huge bit of revenue

00:17:49.980 --> 00:17:53.540
 that even in the risk factors section of their annual report,

00:17:53.540 --> 00:17:56.100
 it was noted their absolute dependence

00:17:56.100 --> 00:17:58.860
 on the continued strength of the beanie baby.

00:17:58.860 --> 00:18:00.700
 - Wow. - They were like, "This has to keep going."

00:18:00.700 --> 00:18:04.500
 And it did, and everyone, Ty Warner and the owners of eBay,

00:18:04.500 --> 00:18:05.860
 all became billionaires.

00:18:05.860 --> 00:18:08.620
 Ty Warner's genius was in marketing.

00:18:08.620 --> 00:18:11.340
 Obviously, this false scarcity bullshit,

00:18:11.340 --> 00:18:13.780
 which, by the way, we're all falling for again

00:18:13.780 --> 00:18:16.300
 with that weird word game that everyone's obsessed with.

00:18:16.300 --> 00:18:17.500
 Aren't we now?

00:18:17.500 --> 00:18:18.500
 So...

00:18:18.500 --> 00:18:21.580
 Oh, one a day, suddenly I really wanted.

00:18:21.580 --> 00:18:22.580
 (LAUGHTER)

00:18:22.580 --> 00:18:24.140
 You know what I'm talking about.

00:18:24.140 --> 00:18:27.460
 So he had some other weird marketing tricks.

00:18:27.460 --> 00:18:30.220
 Ty, he wouldn't sell beanie babies to big stores

00:18:30.220 --> 00:18:31.660
 like Toys R Us or Walmart.

00:18:31.660 --> 00:18:34.460
 He would only sell them to kind of small shops.

00:18:34.460 --> 00:18:36.980
 And he made the stores that he sold them to promise

00:18:36.980 --> 00:18:39.620
 not to sell more than a few to a single customer.

00:18:39.620 --> 00:18:41.660
 So, you know, you reached a limit.

00:18:41.660 --> 00:18:44.220
 And, you know, he'd monitor the stores really obsessively

00:18:44.220 --> 00:18:45.980
 and they'd be under strict instructions,

00:18:45.980 --> 00:18:47.620
 so, like, not discount any.

00:18:47.620 --> 00:18:49.340
 If you discounted a beanie baby,

00:18:49.340 --> 00:18:51.900
 you got all your supplies whipped away from you.

00:18:51.900 --> 00:18:53.180
 It sounds kind of terrifying,

00:18:53.180 --> 00:18:55.460
 and shop owners would call him and beg for stock.

00:18:55.460 --> 00:18:58.100
 And the only time he'd give them what they wanted

00:18:58.100 --> 00:19:00.420
 is if they had a private chat with him

00:19:00.420 --> 00:19:02.340
 about what customers were responding to

00:19:02.340 --> 00:19:04.420
 and what they were liking about certain ones.

00:19:04.420 --> 00:19:06.100
 Wow. It was, like, gangster.

00:19:06.100 --> 00:19:07.860
 It's very... It is a bit mafioso, yeah.

00:19:07.860 --> 00:19:09.780
 Yeah. There was a... There was a scheme.

00:19:09.780 --> 00:19:10.780
 Allegedly.

00:19:10.780 --> 00:19:12.580
 (LAUGHTER)

00:19:12.580 --> 00:19:13.780
 I think he was in the mob.

00:19:13.780 --> 00:19:14.780
 Um...

00:19:14.780 --> 00:19:15.780
 (LAUGHTER)

00:19:15.780 --> 00:19:16.780
 Anyway...

00:19:16.780 --> 00:19:17.780
 Um...

00:19:17.780 --> 00:19:19.780
 There was a thing in Illinois in 1998

00:19:19.780 --> 00:19:20.900
 where there was a police force,

00:19:20.900 --> 00:19:23.860
 a small police force in a place called Kankakee, Illinois, right?

00:19:23.860 --> 00:19:26.660
 They said that if you have an illegal gun,

00:19:26.660 --> 00:19:28.340
 but you hand it into us,

00:19:28.340 --> 00:19:30.860
 you will get a free teeny beanie baby.

00:19:30.860 --> 00:19:31.860
 (LAUGHTER)

00:19:31.860 --> 00:19:32.860
 No way!

00:19:32.860 --> 00:19:34.900
 There was a special small beanie baby that had been made.

00:19:34.900 --> 00:19:36.860
 They got 40 people handing in guns

00:19:36.860 --> 00:19:37.860
 (LAUGHTER)

00:19:37.860 --> 00:19:38.860
 on the center of Beanie Baby.

00:19:38.860 --> 00:19:39.860
 But they were huge!

00:19:39.860 --> 00:19:42.940
 Like, yeah, the resale value of the teeny...

00:19:42.940 --> 00:19:45.380
 or any of the beanie babies was massive.

00:19:45.380 --> 00:19:46.380
 And there was...

00:19:46.380 --> 00:19:48.820
 OK, yes, he went with the independent stores to begin with,

00:19:48.820 --> 00:19:51.340
 but one big decisive moment for the company

00:19:51.340 --> 00:19:53.740
 was when he paired up with McDonald's for the Happy Meal.

00:19:53.740 --> 00:19:55.140
 And so he did the Happy Meal,

00:19:55.140 --> 00:19:57.460
 and they were teeny beanie babies,

00:19:57.460 --> 00:19:59.060
 and they did 100 million of them,

00:19:59.060 --> 00:20:00.500
 and they just went so quick.

00:20:00.500 --> 00:20:02.500
 And it caused chaos for McDonald's.

00:20:02.500 --> 00:20:06.180
 McDonald's were saying that people were ordering 100 Happy Meals

00:20:06.180 --> 00:20:09.220
 and saying, "Keep the food. We just need the babies."

00:20:09.220 --> 00:20:10.220
 (LAUGHTER)

00:20:10.220 --> 00:20:12.660
 They did television adverts

00:20:12.660 --> 00:20:15.060
 over the worry that massive crowds were coming

00:20:15.060 --> 00:20:17.420
 and the safety of the employees were in jeopardy.

00:20:17.420 --> 00:20:19.660
 They were like, "Please, stop."

00:20:19.660 --> 00:20:22.100
 It got to the point where people were calling up to order things,

00:20:22.100 --> 00:20:24.300
 and the people were answering the phone by saying,

00:20:24.300 --> 00:20:27.020
 "Good morning, McDonald's. We have the moose and the lamb."

00:20:27.020 --> 00:20:28.500
 (LAUGHTER)

00:20:28.500 --> 00:20:31.500
 But then, surely, you want either the beef or the chicken, usually.

00:20:31.500 --> 00:20:32.980
 (LAUGHTER)

00:20:32.980 --> 00:20:34.980
 It's going to be confusing.

00:20:34.980 --> 00:20:39.580
 I have a tangentially-related gun fact, since Andy mentioned guns.

00:20:39.580 --> 00:20:40.580
 Yeah, cool.

00:20:40.580 --> 00:20:43.220
 Ty Warner was called H. Ty Warner, right?

00:20:43.220 --> 00:20:45.820
 That was his full name, and the H in his name,

00:20:45.820 --> 00:20:48.020
 he said, just didn't stand for anything.

00:20:48.020 --> 00:20:52.420
 But the reason he was called Ty was because he was named after Ty Cobb,

00:20:52.420 --> 00:20:54.820
 who was a famous baseball player.

00:20:54.820 --> 00:20:57.060
 So then, I just got distracted reading about Ty Cobb.

00:20:57.060 --> 00:20:58.980
 But I found some weird similarities.

00:20:58.980 --> 00:21:00.220
 Ty Cobb's story is amazing.

00:21:00.220 --> 00:21:02.300
 He was a baseball player at the turn of the 20th century,

00:21:02.300 --> 00:21:03.900
 so it's not too dark anymore.

00:21:03.900 --> 00:21:06.900
 But basically, his mum shot...

00:21:06.900 --> 00:21:08.900
 (LAUGHTER)

00:21:08.900 --> 00:21:11.100
 Will be the judge of how dark it is, Anna.

00:21:11.100 --> 00:21:14.540
 I think the people of Dublin might be the judge of this.

00:21:14.540 --> 00:21:16.300
 You're going to be traumatised.

00:21:16.300 --> 00:21:21.100
 Ty Cobb's mum shot his dad dead when...

00:21:21.100 --> 00:21:23.100
 (LAUGHTER)

00:21:23.100 --> 00:21:26.100
 It's OK. It was a long time ago.

00:21:26.100 --> 00:21:29.580
 Dublin's surprisingly up for their stories so far.

00:21:29.580 --> 00:21:36.100
 More than 100 years when the dad had suspected the mum of cheating on him,

00:21:36.100 --> 00:21:41.500
 and so he crept outside her bedroom window to catch her shagging another man.

00:21:41.500 --> 00:21:43.900
 But she thought that he was a burglar,

00:21:43.900 --> 00:21:47.580
 so she seized the gun that he'd given her as a present

00:21:47.580 --> 00:21:52.020
 to protect herself and shot him dead through the window,

00:21:52.020 --> 00:21:55.900
 bam, Ty Cobb's life slightly ruined.

00:21:55.900 --> 00:21:58.500
 But he did...

00:21:58.500 --> 00:22:00.620
 He did always credit his career success

00:22:00.620 --> 00:22:03.740
 to his dad watching over him and making him successful.

00:22:03.740 --> 00:22:07.300
 It's probably a good time to promote Anna's Netflix stand-up special,

00:22:07.300 --> 00:22:09.820
 which will be out very soon.

00:22:09.820 --> 00:22:12.260
 No, I'm calling it. That's funny.

00:22:12.260 --> 00:22:14.260
 The way...

00:22:14.260 --> 00:22:18.180
 Don't give someone a gun.

00:22:18.180 --> 00:22:23.140
 The way it's related is that Ty Warner also credited his dad with his career success

00:22:23.140 --> 00:22:28.940
 because he used the inheritance from his deceased father to found the company.

00:22:28.940 --> 00:22:30.940
 Wow.

00:22:30.940 --> 00:22:34.460
 That's why I told the dark gun story.

00:22:34.460 --> 00:22:36.460
 She's paying the big bucks.

00:22:36.460 --> 00:22:39.300
 Shall we go dark? Shall we keep going dark?

00:22:39.300 --> 00:22:43.580
 This is, according to the new book, so this is The Great Beanie Baby Bubble

00:22:43.580 --> 00:22:47.820
 by Zack Bissonette, which a lot of, at least the stuff that I've been reading has come from.

00:22:47.820 --> 00:22:51.900
 And he said that when Ty Warner saw the guy from Beanie Babies,

00:22:51.900 --> 00:22:56.380
 when his father died, he waited for five days to tell his sister

00:22:56.380 --> 00:22:59.860
 so that he could clear out his father's auntie's collection.

00:22:59.860 --> 00:23:01.860
 Oh, come on.

00:23:01.860 --> 00:23:04.140
 Wow. To take for himself?

00:23:04.140 --> 00:23:08.900
 Yeah. Yeah, his employees don't speak well about him.

00:23:08.900 --> 00:23:14.220
 I do, because he's still alive and I don't want a billionaire to sue us.

00:23:14.220 --> 00:23:16.220
 I think he's ace.

00:23:16.220 --> 00:23:21.100
 Although he was done for tax evasion, wasn't he?

00:23:21.100 --> 00:23:26.180
 Yeah, he was. He had 100 million dollars, which was in a secret Swiss bank account.

00:23:26.180 --> 00:23:30.340
 And every time he was asked on the tax forms, "Do you have money hidden overseas?"

00:23:30.340 --> 00:23:33.580
 he would tick the no option. And he did that for years and years and years.

00:23:33.580 --> 00:23:35.340
 He had a rookie era, basically.

00:23:35.340 --> 00:23:39.180
 The Wall Street Journal had said that he didn't really have very much money,

00:23:39.180 --> 00:23:40.420
 not as much money as he said.

00:23:40.420 --> 00:23:44.100
 And so he took out a full page advert in the Wall Street Journal saying,

00:23:44.100 --> 00:23:46.420
 "I've got fuckloads of money."

00:23:46.420 --> 00:23:51.300
 And the IRS went, "Oh, you do, do you?"

00:23:51.300 --> 00:23:56.260
 Just another story very quickly that I just love all these fights over Beanie Babies.

00:23:56.260 --> 00:23:59.060
 And there was a divorce that got taken to court.

00:23:59.060 --> 00:24:02.660
 And during the divorce proceedings, one of the sticking points,

00:24:02.660 --> 00:24:06.940
 which the judge got frustrated about, was the fact that the couple couldn't decide

00:24:06.940 --> 00:24:09.500
 how to split up their Beanie Baby collection.

00:24:09.500 --> 00:24:15.900
 And in the courtroom, the judge ordered them to actually split them up in the room

00:24:15.900 --> 00:24:22.300
 by pouring the Beanie Babies onto the floor and getting them to each pick one one at a time.

00:24:22.300 --> 00:24:24.380
 Oh, like you pick a football team?

00:24:24.380 --> 00:24:26.180
 Yes, exactly, like a football team.

00:24:26.180 --> 00:24:29.340
 And my favorite paragraph in the article is,

00:24:29.340 --> 00:24:31.980
 "I don't agree with the judge's decision to do this.

00:24:31.980 --> 00:24:35.460
 It's ridiculous and embarrassing," Francis Mountain said,

00:24:35.460 --> 00:24:39.540
 "moments before squatting on the courtroom floor alongside her ex-husband

00:24:39.540 --> 00:24:44.460
 to choose the first from a pile of stuffed toys."

00:24:44.460 --> 00:24:46.580
 We're going to have to move on, guys, to our next fact.

00:24:46.580 --> 00:24:47.860
 Yeah, we can. Yeah, should we do it?

00:24:47.860 --> 00:24:53.020
 Okay, it is time for fact number three, and that is my fact.

00:24:53.020 --> 00:24:58.500
 My fact this week is that due to the interests of its production coordinator,

00:24:58.500 --> 00:25:05.180
 Michigan State University's Planetarium not only dedicates itself to space science education,

00:25:05.180 --> 00:25:11.340
 but also houses the world's only moist towelette museum.

00:25:11.340 --> 00:25:17.100
 And this is it here, the moist towelette museum, showing a picture to the audience here.

00:25:17.100 --> 00:25:22.380
 It's basically what it is, is there's this big Planetarium at the Michigan State University

00:25:22.380 --> 00:25:26.060
 and their production coordinator, a guy called John French,

00:25:26.060 --> 00:25:30.700
 just opened the door to his office, put up a sign, and started displaying all the...

00:25:30.700 --> 00:25:32.780
 Yeah, I would say, Dan, can we explain this?

00:25:32.780 --> 00:25:36.860
 Like, maybe describe it to the people at home, because it doesn't really look like an office.

00:25:36.860 --> 00:25:39.100
 It just looks like a filing cabinet.

00:25:39.100 --> 00:25:44.940
 We're only seeing... So, on the left of the photo that we can see here is his computer and his desk.

00:25:44.940 --> 00:25:51.220
 And what he's done is he's set up two cabinets that should have probably relevant things to his job on it,

00:25:51.220 --> 00:25:54.860
 but he's emptied it and he's just covered it in moist towelettes.

00:25:54.860 --> 00:25:59.980
 And he had this idea when he was at the Planetarium in Texas,

00:25:59.980 --> 00:26:06.460
 and he took a cabinet that had the Mars rover on it, and he put his moist towelettes on it,

00:26:06.460 --> 00:26:11.420
 and he said, "I noticed that more people were looking at this cabinet when it had my moist towelettes on it

00:26:11.420 --> 00:26:14.940
 than when it had the Mars rover. Maybe I'm on to something."

00:26:14.940 --> 00:26:21.820
 And I guess no one had a choice in the matter, but he now runs the only museum that has it.

00:26:21.820 --> 00:26:27.180
 And it's fascinating, he's got a thousand of these things, and people all over the world send it to him.

00:26:27.180 --> 00:26:32.940
 And moist towelettes are incredible. The variety out there that we have of them is...

00:26:32.940 --> 00:26:34.140
 It's not that much, actually.

00:26:34.140 --> 00:26:39.980
 Oh, no! I mean, there's specific ones to wipe on your fingers for when they're blackened by a typewriter.

00:26:39.980 --> 00:26:46.300
 There are ones that you should use called "radiac wash" to wipe away when you're radioactively contaminated.

00:26:46.300 --> 00:26:47.660
 Wow!

00:26:47.660 --> 00:26:49.500
 What? I would hope.

00:26:49.500 --> 00:26:54.780
 If I'd been contaminated by radiation, I'd hope for a little more attention from the authorities

00:26:54.780 --> 00:26:58.780
 than a moist towelette.

00:26:58.780 --> 00:27:03.420
 That's very much the final thing we do after the big shower.

00:27:03.420 --> 00:27:07.900
 No, there was just an air stewadess walking through Chernobyl, okay?

00:27:07.900 --> 00:27:09.420
 A moist towel, anyone?

00:27:09.420 --> 00:27:14.380
 Dan, this is the most punishingly dull area of... I think we may ever have covered the moist...

00:27:14.380 --> 00:27:16.060
 What? This is incredible!

00:27:16.060 --> 00:27:21.180
 Well, I've been captured by it, too. Look, I found myself getting deep into moist towelette world

00:27:21.180 --> 00:27:24.300
 because there are interesting, very interesting elements to it.

00:27:24.300 --> 00:27:30.300
 For example, did you know that 6% of moist towelettes are used on cars?

00:27:30.300 --> 00:27:32.140
 Unbelievable.

00:27:32.140 --> 00:27:33.180
 You see?

00:27:33.180 --> 00:27:36.940
 But that's interesting. Wet wipes. 6% used on cars. You wouldn't have thought that, would you?

00:27:36.940 --> 00:27:38.620
 I wouldn't have thought that. I wouldn't have thought it.

00:27:38.620 --> 00:27:44.700
 No, like, guys, give it a chance. This is a fascinating thing.

00:27:44.700 --> 00:27:47.980
 French has been doing this, John French, for 20 years.

00:27:47.980 --> 00:27:52.860
 And he's even found the holy grail of moist towelettes, which he's...

00:27:52.860 --> 00:27:56.940
 The moist towelette that Christ used at the Last Supper.

00:27:56.940 --> 00:27:58.700
 The Turin towelette is...

00:27:58.700 --> 00:28:01.420
 I'm excited. It has his finger marks on it.

00:28:01.420 --> 00:28:04.940
 No, he found... So he's only got it...

00:28:04.940 --> 00:28:08.700
 John French has a website. I highly encourage you to check it out.

00:28:08.700 --> 00:28:13.420
 He can't reply to everyone who gets in contact with because he is inundated.

00:28:14.380 --> 00:28:15.980
 And there is an address.

00:28:15.980 --> 00:28:20.620
 And if you'd like to send your own moist towelette to him, do send it unused.

00:28:20.620 --> 00:28:23.500
 He does have one which is used.

00:28:23.500 --> 00:28:25.900
 It's a celebrity one to be fair.

00:28:25.900 --> 00:28:28.300
 So if you're a celebrity in the audience tonight, do use it first.

00:28:28.300 --> 00:28:29.820
 Who was it? Elvis or...

00:28:29.820 --> 00:28:30.700
 It was... No.

00:28:30.700 --> 00:28:32.140
 Do you mind if I take this one? Go for it.

00:28:32.140 --> 00:28:35.420
 It was donated by Tom and Ray Macliotsi.

00:28:35.420 --> 00:28:37.580
 So I don't need to tell you guys who they are.

00:28:37.580 --> 00:28:41.740
 But for any listeners at home, they host NPR's car talk show.

00:28:41.740 --> 00:28:46.860
 And the moist towelette they sent him was used to clean off some grease from a car once.

00:28:46.860 --> 00:28:48.860
 Oh, so one of the six per cent?

00:28:48.860 --> 00:28:49.740
 There we are.

00:28:49.740 --> 00:28:55.020
 So you can understand why he made an exception for that incredibly famous towelette.

00:28:55.020 --> 00:29:01.340
 But so on his website, he has what he says is the holy grail of moist towelettes.

00:29:01.340 --> 00:29:02.300
 They're just not sending it.

00:29:02.300 --> 00:29:04.700
 Damn, for fuck's sake, tell us what this is.

00:29:04.700 --> 00:29:07.900
 So it's a series of Star Trek moist towelettes

00:29:07.900 --> 00:29:10.460
 which have the image of Captain Kirk and Spock on it.

00:29:10.460 --> 00:29:12.700
 I've seen them. I've seen the photo on his website.

00:29:12.700 --> 00:29:15.020
 And yeah, they look impressive.

00:29:15.020 --> 00:29:18.060
 Well, they just have a photo on the towel.

00:29:18.060 --> 00:29:19.500
 No, it's not on the packaging.

00:29:19.500 --> 00:29:20.700
 It's on the packaging.

00:29:20.700 --> 00:29:22.300
 And we don't have that kind of technology.

00:29:22.300 --> 00:29:23.820
 You're going to put ink on it.

00:29:23.820 --> 00:29:24.940
 Come on, Anna, calm down.

00:29:24.940 --> 00:29:30.700
 Anyway, so I knew it was a good idea to do this fact tonight.

00:29:30.700 --> 00:29:31.580
 I can feel where...

00:29:31.580 --> 00:29:35.500
 Do you want to know something about the history of moist towelettes then?

00:29:35.500 --> 00:29:36.300
 Of course.

00:29:36.300 --> 00:29:37.100
 All together now?

00:29:37.580 --> 00:29:38.540
 Yes!

00:29:38.540 --> 00:29:41.420
 Great.

00:29:41.420 --> 00:29:42.300
 Someone said no.

00:29:42.300 --> 00:29:43.020
 Get out.

00:29:43.020 --> 00:29:45.900
 Out. Wrong room.

00:29:45.900 --> 00:29:47.740
 Yeah, you do not belong here.

00:29:47.740 --> 00:29:52.220
 Look, the reason they became the phenomenon they are today

00:29:52.220 --> 00:29:53.980
 and the reason we're all so excited by them

00:29:53.980 --> 00:29:57.740
 is because of a guy called Arthur Julius and the Colonel.

00:29:57.740 --> 00:30:01.340
 So Kentucky Fried Chicken brought us moist towelettes.

00:30:01.340 --> 00:30:04.460
 And this is in 1958 and he invented it.

00:30:04.460 --> 00:30:06.620
 And it was quite a big deal, right?

00:30:06.620 --> 00:30:11.340
 The idea that you can have something that stays damp for so long

00:30:11.340 --> 00:30:17.500
 and that doesn't disintegrate when you're cleaning stuff

00:30:17.500 --> 00:30:19.180
 is pretty amazing technology.

00:30:19.180 --> 00:30:20.220
 Absolutely, damn straight.

00:30:20.220 --> 00:30:24.380
 So he struck a deal with KFC.

00:30:24.380 --> 00:30:30.620
 Struck a deal with KFC to provide a free wet wipe with every KFC meal,

00:30:30.620 --> 00:30:32.380
 which works because they're finger-licking good,

00:30:32.380 --> 00:30:35.100
 but even licking your fingers sometimes isn't enough.

00:30:35.100 --> 00:30:37.180
 And that's where they took off.

00:30:37.180 --> 00:30:41.420
 It is quite amazing, that kind of how moist they keep.

00:30:41.420 --> 00:30:42.380
 It's extraordinary.

00:30:42.380 --> 00:30:43.420
 Do you have data?

00:30:43.420 --> 00:30:44.460
 They advertised it.

00:30:44.460 --> 00:30:47.500
 KFC advertised it as what your tongue doesn't get.

00:30:47.500 --> 00:30:48.540
 The wet wipe will.

00:30:48.540 --> 00:30:55.180
 Someone just commented, "That's my Tinder bio."

00:31:01.260 --> 00:31:07.340
 In the last 25 years, KFC has given away nearly a billion wet wipes.

00:31:07.340 --> 00:31:11.180
 And those wet wipes would reach halfway to the moon.

00:31:11.180 --> 00:31:13.580
 Overall, the amount of wet wipes of this company

00:31:13.580 --> 00:31:17.500
 nice and clean have made in America is 150 billion.

00:31:17.500 --> 00:31:21.340
 And that would go to the moon about 30 odd times, something like that.

00:31:21.340 --> 00:31:21.900
 Really?

00:31:21.900 --> 00:31:22.860
 So many.

00:31:22.860 --> 00:31:23.820
 Wow.

00:31:23.820 --> 00:31:25.660
 But the thing is about the moist towelettes

00:31:25.660 --> 00:31:27.180
 is they make so many of them

00:31:27.180 --> 00:31:29.900
 and basically people flush them down the toilet, don't they?

00:31:29.900 --> 00:31:32.540
 So by the way, the fact that you've been cheering them so far

00:31:32.540 --> 00:31:37.100
 is disgusting because they are basically the bad guys of the modern day.

00:31:37.100 --> 00:31:38.060
 They're very bad, aren't they?

00:31:38.060 --> 00:31:38.860
 Very bad.

00:31:38.860 --> 00:31:40.460
 They make fatbergs basically.

00:31:40.460 --> 00:31:44.380
 And the biggest fatberg in the UK quite recently found in Liverpool,

00:31:44.380 --> 00:31:49.340
 it weighed 400 tonnes and it was 250 metres long.

00:31:49.340 --> 00:31:49.980
 Wow.

00:31:49.980 --> 00:31:53.180
 And if you add that one to one that was found in Birmingham in the same year,

00:31:53.180 --> 00:31:55.820
 those two fatbergs alone would weigh more

00:31:55.820 --> 00:31:58.780
 than the giant statue of Christ in Rio de Janeiro.

00:31:58.780 --> 00:31:59.740
 Wow.

00:31:59.740 --> 00:32:01.980
 But no one has suggested a switch.

00:32:01.980 --> 00:32:09.100
 There was also a 2020 study in Ireland by Coastwatch

00:32:09.100 --> 00:32:14.700
 and they said that wet wipes are the main cause of microplastics in the sea.

00:32:14.700 --> 00:32:16.620
 You know, like these tiny little bits of plastic

00:32:16.620 --> 00:32:19.260
 and it's because little threads come off the wet wipes

00:32:19.260 --> 00:32:20.620
 and they end up in the sea.

00:32:20.620 --> 00:32:22.940
 And there's a teenager called Fionn Ferreira.

00:32:22.940 --> 00:32:26.460
 He's an Irish teenager and he's developed a technique

00:32:26.460 --> 00:32:29.180
 to remove this microplastics.

00:32:29.180 --> 00:32:31.820
 And this original fact was about planetariums.

00:32:31.820 --> 00:32:32.220
 Yeah.

00:32:32.220 --> 00:32:37.180
 And he also worked as a curator at Shull's Planetarium in County Cork.

00:32:37.180 --> 00:32:37.740
 No.

00:32:37.740 --> 00:32:39.180
 So it's another...

00:32:39.180 --> 00:32:39.820
 Yeah.

00:32:39.820 --> 00:32:40.380
 Wow.

00:32:40.380 --> 00:32:44.620
 So there's something about planetariums and wet wipes.

00:32:44.620 --> 00:32:46.220
 Were they just kind of drawn together?

00:32:46.220 --> 00:32:48.940
 Well, just one extra coincidence.

00:32:48.940 --> 00:32:50.940
 Yeah, there's a link.

00:32:50.940 --> 00:32:56.060
 The first ever use of the word wet wipe, phrase wet wipe, was in 1966

00:32:56.060 --> 00:32:57.900
 and it was from a NASA study.

00:32:57.900 --> 00:32:59.100
 This is really cool.

00:32:59.100 --> 00:33:01.020
 It was a study called Effective Diet and Atmosphere

00:33:01.020 --> 00:33:03.020
 on intestinal and skin flora.

00:33:03.020 --> 00:33:05.340
 So basically they were trying to work out

00:33:05.340 --> 00:33:07.020
 how's it that was sarcasm when I heard it.

00:33:07.020 --> 00:33:10.300
 It was a study.

00:33:10.300 --> 00:33:13.100
 It was a study trying to work out the influence of space flight,

00:33:13.100 --> 00:33:15.980
 what it would do to the microorganisms on your skin.

00:33:15.980 --> 00:33:19.100
 And they got, I think, 16 men and they studied them,

00:33:19.100 --> 00:33:20.940
 I think, in space-like conditions.

00:33:20.940 --> 00:33:22.860
 I don't think they actually sent them to space.

00:33:22.860 --> 00:33:25.820
 And they were kept in one environment for 42 days

00:33:25.820 --> 00:33:29.580
 and they were being kept without doing much washing

00:33:29.580 --> 00:33:32.540
 and their microorganisms on their skin were being studied.

00:33:32.540 --> 00:33:34.220
 Like areas including, I'm quoting here,

00:33:34.220 --> 00:33:39.180
 the ear, eyes, nails, umbilicus, anal fold, you name it.

00:33:39.180 --> 00:33:40.300
 The umbilicus.

00:33:40.300 --> 00:33:41.100
 Yeah, the belly button.

00:33:41.100 --> 00:33:41.660
 Belly button.

00:33:41.660 --> 00:33:42.300
 The belly button.

00:33:42.300 --> 00:33:43.980
 Yeah, we'll just go with the fucking belly button, guys.

00:33:43.980 --> 00:33:45.100
 Yeah, yeah.

00:33:45.100 --> 00:33:46.060
 I'm quite a NASA here.

00:33:46.060 --> 00:33:46.540
 Yeah.

00:33:46.540 --> 00:33:47.580
 But anyway.

00:33:47.580 --> 00:33:48.940
 But what's anal fold?

00:33:48.940 --> 00:33:50.780
 Oh, do you not have one?

00:33:50.780 --> 00:33:51.100
 We've all...

00:33:51.100 --> 00:33:51.740
 Ass crack.

00:33:51.740 --> 00:33:53.580
 Is that what it means?

00:33:53.580 --> 00:33:56.060
 I can't believe I'm having to do all this translation

00:33:56.060 --> 00:33:57.260
 from this side of the room.

00:33:57.260 --> 00:33:59.500
 Is that genuinely what NASA calls our butt crack?

00:33:59.500 --> 00:34:00.300
 Anal fold.

00:34:00.300 --> 00:34:00.860
 I'm afraid so.

00:34:00.860 --> 00:34:02.300
 Anal fold, yeah.

00:34:02.300 --> 00:34:05.100
 But, get this, the way they were allowed to clean themselves

00:34:05.100 --> 00:34:06.620
 in this study was as follows,

00:34:06.620 --> 00:34:08.620
 and this is where we get the phrase wet wipes from,

00:34:08.620 --> 00:34:12.300
 only wet wipes were allowed and were limited to three a day

00:34:12.300 --> 00:34:15.740
 for hand wiping following eating and defecation.

00:34:15.740 --> 00:34:19.660
 That was all the cleaning they were allowed to do.

00:34:19.660 --> 00:34:20.940
 Three wet wipes a day.

00:34:20.940 --> 00:34:22.940
 Would you poo once a day and eat twice a day?

00:34:23.820 --> 00:34:25.100
 Or vice versa?

00:34:25.100 --> 00:34:27.420
 I think the number of times you poo on a day

00:34:27.420 --> 00:34:28.700
 depends on how much you eat a day.

00:34:28.700 --> 00:34:29.420
 That's a good point.

00:34:29.420 --> 00:34:31.660
 Well, they're not allowed to correspond, James, so...

00:34:31.660 --> 00:34:35.100
 I would go for, like, three nil, but on alternate days.

00:34:35.100 --> 00:34:36.620
 Yeah, I love that.

00:34:36.620 --> 00:34:39.260
 Guys, we're going to have to move on very soon

00:34:39.260 --> 00:34:40.060
 to our next fact.

00:34:40.060 --> 00:34:41.660
 Our final fact.

00:34:41.660 --> 00:34:43.020
 Shall I quickly just tell you one thing

00:34:43.020 --> 00:34:44.060
 about planetarium?

00:34:44.060 --> 00:34:44.860
 It's our planetarium.

00:34:44.860 --> 00:34:45.420
 Yeah.

00:34:45.420 --> 00:34:47.020
 One of my favourite ones is in Moscow,

00:34:47.020 --> 00:34:47.980
 Moscow Planetarium.

00:34:47.980 --> 00:34:48.540
 I've been there.

00:34:48.540 --> 00:34:49.340
 It's really, really good.

00:34:49.340 --> 00:34:52.060
 They have a really, really massive dome,

00:34:52.060 --> 00:34:54.860
 and what is cool about it is the outer dome

00:34:54.860 --> 00:34:57.900
 is only eight centimetres thick at the top.

00:34:57.900 --> 00:34:59.900
 It goes down to 12 centimetres thick at the bottom.

00:34:59.900 --> 00:35:01.260
 It's really, really thin.

00:35:01.260 --> 00:35:03.020
 And that means that if you shrunk it down,

00:35:03.020 --> 00:35:05.180
 it would be thinner than an eggshell.

00:35:05.180 --> 00:35:05.980
 This is this planetarium.

00:35:05.980 --> 00:35:07.100
 If it was the size of an egg.

00:35:07.100 --> 00:35:08.060
 If it was the size of an egg.

00:35:08.060 --> 00:35:09.500
 That's amazing.

00:35:09.500 --> 00:35:12.300
 And the reason I bring it up is for you, Andy, really,

00:35:12.300 --> 00:35:14.780
 because it has a load of insulation in this.

00:35:14.780 --> 00:35:15.740
 And guess what it's made of?

00:35:15.740 --> 00:35:16.540
 Oh.

00:35:16.540 --> 00:35:17.260
 Is it moss?

00:35:17.260 --> 00:35:17.980
 It's moss.

00:35:17.980 --> 00:35:18.780
 Yes!

00:35:18.780 --> 00:35:24.060
 [APPLAUSE]

00:35:24.060 --> 00:35:27.340
 OK, it is time for our final fact of the show,

00:35:27.340 --> 00:35:29.500
 and that is Anna.

00:35:29.500 --> 00:35:32.540
 My fact this week is that 72 years

00:35:32.540 --> 00:35:35.100
 after the first Miss America contest,

00:35:35.100 --> 00:35:38.620
 the runner-up was still claiming I won it, hands down.

00:35:38.620 --> 00:35:42.460
 So this was 1921,

00:35:42.460 --> 00:35:44.780
 and at the time it was called the Intercity Beauty Contest.

00:35:44.780 --> 00:35:46.460
 It was an Atlantic City,

00:35:46.460 --> 00:35:48.780
 and the official winner,

00:35:48.780 --> 00:35:50.700
 according to the Miss America history,

00:35:50.700 --> 00:35:52.060
 it was a woman called a girl,

00:35:52.060 --> 00:35:54.220
 a 16-year-old girl called Margaret Gorman.

00:35:54.220 --> 00:35:57.340
 But there was also Miss Virginia Lee,

00:35:57.340 --> 00:35:59.660
 who was about 20, 21,

00:35:59.660 --> 00:36:02.780
 a bit too old almost for Miss America.

00:36:02.780 --> 00:36:06.060
 And so it was between Virginia and Margaret.

00:36:06.060 --> 00:36:08.780
 Everyone was saying they're the two best,

00:36:08.780 --> 00:36:10.140
 whatever you're supposed to be good at.

00:36:10.140 --> 00:36:14.540
 And then when the contest had ended,

00:36:14.540 --> 00:36:16.060
 before the results were announced,

00:36:16.060 --> 00:36:18.380
 and this is the first ever Miss America,

00:36:18.380 --> 00:36:20.060
 suddenly Virginia is disqualified.

00:36:20.060 --> 00:36:21.980
 And she was disqualified for being a professional.

00:36:21.980 --> 00:36:23.980
 It wasn't made clear before the contest

00:36:23.980 --> 00:36:26.300
 that it was amateurs only, but...

00:36:26.300 --> 00:36:27.900
 What is a professional in this context

00:36:27.900 --> 00:36:29.900
 where the criterion is just being fit?

00:36:29.900 --> 00:36:33.820
 Right, that's a huge misconception.

00:36:33.820 --> 00:36:37.980
 And B, I think everyone else had won local beauty contests

00:36:37.980 --> 00:36:40.460
 and then been upgraded to the National Beauty Contest,

00:36:40.460 --> 00:36:42.620
 whereas she just had a modelling contract for the magazine.

00:36:42.620 --> 00:36:44.620
 Yeah, she was a model, I think, is the point.

00:36:44.620 --> 00:36:47.500
 Yeah, and also one of the judges of the competition

00:36:47.500 --> 00:36:50.060
 ran the magazine that employed her as a model.

00:36:50.060 --> 00:36:51.660
 And perhaps that was all discovered.

00:36:51.660 --> 00:36:53.420
 And anyway, she was quite bitter about it.

00:36:53.420 --> 00:36:57.740
 And she always claimed that they told her even years afterward,

00:36:57.740 --> 00:36:58.940
 "Look, you won it really,

00:36:58.940 --> 00:37:00.540
 "but they said we can't give it to you,

00:37:00.540 --> 00:37:01.820
 "so this other woman won it."

00:37:01.820 --> 00:37:04.380
 So that's the controversial start to Miss America.

00:37:04.380 --> 00:37:07.980
 Yeah, it was quite an interesting event, wasn't it?

00:37:07.980 --> 00:37:13.100
 Because these women were brought on with King Neptune,

00:37:14.060 --> 00:37:16.940
 who was a one-handed inventor,

00:37:16.940 --> 00:37:19.740
 brother of friend of the podcast Hiram Maxim.

00:37:19.740 --> 00:37:22.940
 So Hiram Maxim, who invented the machine gun,

00:37:22.940 --> 00:37:26.540
 his brother was this guy, he was dressed as King Neptune.

00:37:26.540 --> 00:37:31.020
 He only had one hand because he'd lost it in a mercury explosion in 1894.

00:37:31.020 --> 00:37:35.900
 And he'd invented smokeless gunpowder.

00:37:35.900 --> 00:37:39.580
 Thomas Edison referred to him as the most versatile man in America.

00:37:39.580 --> 00:37:42.540
 It sounds pretty versatile if he's invented gunpowder

00:37:42.540 --> 00:37:45.980
 and simultaneously pretending to be King Neptune at a beauty contest.

00:37:45.980 --> 00:37:48.380
 That is the apex of the story.

00:37:48.380 --> 00:37:52.940
 But yeah, and it was basically in order to stop people going home

00:37:52.940 --> 00:37:56.140
 from Atlantic City because it was a big resort

00:37:56.140 --> 00:37:57.980
 and people would go home at the end of the summer,

00:37:57.980 --> 00:37:59.340
 but they wanted to keep people there.

00:37:59.340 --> 00:38:01.580
 So they had this extra thing to try and keep people there.

00:38:01.580 --> 00:38:03.820
 Yeah, it was all part of the Fall Frolick.

00:38:03.820 --> 00:38:04.780
 Yeah.

00:38:04.780 --> 00:38:07.980
 So it was a whole big festival where they had lots of other stuff on.

00:38:07.980 --> 00:38:10.540
 And actually, it was inspired by the Baby Parade,

00:38:10.540 --> 00:38:13.660
 which was really popular and had been since about 1900,

00:38:13.660 --> 00:38:18.540
 where you wheeled out your fit baby in a pram and people judged it.

00:38:18.540 --> 00:38:21.420
 And then I was looking up.

00:38:21.420 --> 00:38:22.540
 What would they do with it?

00:38:22.540 --> 00:38:23.580
 Was there a talent round?

00:38:23.580 --> 00:38:24.380
 Was there?

00:38:24.380 --> 00:38:27.100
 It was more like you looked at them and you put them in a nice bonnet

00:38:27.100 --> 00:38:28.620
 and you wheeled them around.

00:38:28.620 --> 00:38:32.620
 And actually, baby was a stretch because I read in one newspaper article

00:38:32.620 --> 00:38:37.340
 about 1928 that the baby parade, you had to be between six and 12 years old.

00:38:37.340 --> 00:38:40.460
 But then the following year, a three-year-old won it.

00:38:40.460 --> 00:38:41.420
 Wow.

00:38:41.420 --> 00:38:45.260
 You know, there are the sort of interview sections in the pageants.

00:38:45.260 --> 00:38:49.420
 You know, there was the swimsuit round until very, very recently in one of them.

00:38:49.420 --> 00:38:54.220
 And anyway, in 2011, here are samples of the Miss USA questions.

00:38:54.220 --> 00:38:58.620
 Which, just to be really clear, Miss USA is completely different to Miss America.

00:38:58.620 --> 00:38:59.820
 Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:38:59.820 --> 00:39:03.500
 Anyway, the questions in 2011 included asking whether evolution

00:39:03.500 --> 00:39:07.020
 should be taught in schools, which is frankly a poser.

00:39:07.020 --> 00:39:09.820
 I mean, you could spend hours talking about that in your answer.

00:39:09.820 --> 00:39:13.100
 And should the US Constitution protect the burning of religious books?

00:39:13.100 --> 00:39:14.940
 Oh my God.

00:39:14.940 --> 00:39:18.380
 To be fair, contestants were also asked if they could make the sounds of a cat,

00:39:18.380 --> 00:39:20.060
 a police siren and a slot machine.

00:39:20.060 --> 00:39:22.940
 A slot machine?

00:39:22.940 --> 00:39:25.980
 Amazing.

00:39:25.980 --> 00:39:28.860
 It's quite nice because when you read about the history of Miss America,

00:39:28.860 --> 00:39:31.820
 from the start, women have just been really skeptical about it.

00:39:31.820 --> 00:39:35.340
 And the biggest controversy was back in 1938.

00:39:35.980 --> 00:39:39.740
 Well, in fact, in 1938, Miss America contestants were banned.

00:39:39.740 --> 00:39:41.340
 The interview round was very hard then.

00:39:41.340 --> 00:39:43.340
 What do you think about the annexation of Austria?

00:39:43.340 --> 00:39:48.700
 Do you think Chamberlain might have actually been right to declare peace in our time,

00:39:48.700 --> 00:39:52.620
 given that that gave Britain vital time to rearm in the anticipation

00:39:52.620 --> 00:39:54.460
 of an inevitable war next year?

00:39:54.460 --> 00:39:57.180
 It was slightly too early for the Chamberlain question, but yeah.

00:39:57.180 --> 00:39:59.500
 Idiot.

00:40:03.420 --> 00:40:08.220
 No, in 1938, Miss America contestants were banned from spending time alone with a man

00:40:08.220 --> 00:40:10.780
 for the week before the pageant results were announced.

00:40:10.780 --> 00:40:15.180
 And that was because in 1937, and this is a huge deal, Miss America,

00:40:15.180 --> 00:40:18.380
 but the winner of Miss America, instead of being there for the ceremony

00:40:18.380 --> 00:40:21.820
 when the crown was placed on her head, was absent because she'd run off

00:40:21.820 --> 00:40:26.460
 with her chaperone for the week and the crown had to be placed on an empty chair.

00:40:26.460 --> 00:40:27.260
 Oh wow.

00:40:27.260 --> 00:40:29.180
 It's such a good story.

00:40:29.180 --> 00:40:31.020
 Just give it to someone else, wouldn't you?

00:40:31.020 --> 00:40:33.980
 Well, no, they had to stand by their principles, and their principles were that

00:40:33.980 --> 00:40:35.340
 Bette Cooper had won.

00:40:35.340 --> 00:40:36.220
 Wow.

00:40:36.220 --> 00:40:37.900
 And Bette Cooper didn't give a shit.

00:40:37.900 --> 00:40:44.540
 The only reason she'd entered was because her family kind of wanted a holiday in New Jersey,

00:40:44.540 --> 00:40:46.940
 and they were kind of against the contest, but they were like,

00:40:46.940 --> 00:40:48.780
 "Come on, our daughter's not going to win. Look at her."

00:40:48.780 --> 00:40:53.420
 And genuinely, they were like, "You'll never win, so it's fine."

00:40:53.420 --> 00:40:56.700
 And she did win, and they had a chaperone for the week,

00:40:56.700 --> 00:40:59.420
 like a driver to drive them around the event the week before the event.

00:40:59.420 --> 00:41:00.540
 And she liked him.

00:41:00.540 --> 00:41:01.580
 She started flirting with him.

00:41:01.580 --> 00:41:05.180
 He was called Louis Off, and she ran off with him.

00:41:05.180 --> 00:41:07.420
 Nice.

00:41:07.420 --> 00:41:12.300
 They did have, genuinely, it was in the contract, and this is Miss America,

00:41:12.300 --> 00:41:18.300
 where they would say that you had to pledge a vow to not having been either married or pregnant

00:41:18.300 --> 00:41:20.060
 in order to enter the competition.

00:41:20.060 --> 00:41:23.980
 Like, they were so stringent on the idea that you had to be this pure person.

00:41:23.980 --> 00:41:28.380
 And there were countless examples, again, just the fact that the women who did enter it

00:41:28.380 --> 00:41:29.900
 buckled the system when they won.

00:41:29.900 --> 00:41:34.620
 A lot of them just saying, "I'm not playing up to the thing that you're expecting of me."

00:41:34.620 --> 00:41:38.300
 But they did have all these clauses that you had to do as you were going in.

00:41:38.300 --> 00:41:39.180
 They still do.

00:41:39.180 --> 00:41:40.060
 Yeah, they still do.

00:41:40.060 --> 00:41:42.220
 I can't be married, but they...

00:41:42.220 --> 00:41:43.820
 Well, there is Mrs. World.

00:41:43.820 --> 00:41:44.620
 There is Mrs. World.

00:41:44.620 --> 00:41:46.140
 Genuinely, that really is a competition.

00:41:46.140 --> 00:41:48.620
 There is Mrs. World, which is for married women.

00:41:48.620 --> 00:41:51.900
 But they had a huge row last year, because at the prize giving,

00:41:51.900 --> 00:41:56.620
 one of the contestants punched the winner and ripped the crown off her head,

00:41:56.620 --> 00:41:58.620
 saying, "You're divorced."

00:41:58.620 --> 00:42:01.900
 And then... Like, genuinely, this happened.

00:42:01.900 --> 00:42:05.100
 And the winner said, "I'm separated. I'm not divorced."

00:42:05.100 --> 00:42:08.140
 And so... Wow.

00:42:08.140 --> 00:42:10.700
 Great Mrs. World, Canada, if the marriage was broken down that far.

00:42:10.700 --> 00:42:14.460
 If you are divorced, are you allowed to go back into the Miss America or...?

00:42:14.460 --> 00:42:18.940
 That's miss annulment, you're thinking of, which is completely different, yeah.

00:42:18.940 --> 00:42:22.540
 There was a controversy in Miss World in 2013.

00:42:22.540 --> 00:42:24.540
 This was Miss Uzbekistan.

00:42:24.540 --> 00:42:29.420
 The Uzbekistan officials said that she'd left a few things off her profile.

00:42:29.420 --> 00:42:33.260
 Namely, the fact that the country has never held a Miss Uzbekistan contest.

00:42:33.260 --> 00:42:37.420
 And they had literally no idea who she was.

00:42:37.420 --> 00:42:40.380
 She just rocked up and she went, "Yeah, I miss Uzbekistan."

00:42:40.380 --> 00:42:41.180
 And they went, "All right."

00:42:41.180 --> 00:42:42.380
 That's awesome.

00:42:42.380 --> 00:42:43.980
 That's big brain time.

00:42:43.980 --> 00:42:45.020
 That is. That's amazing.

00:42:45.020 --> 00:42:47.820
 How did she do it? Did they keep her in or did she...?

00:42:47.820 --> 00:42:50.300
 They kept her in. Yeah, she didn't do particularly well.

00:42:50.300 --> 00:42:52.700
 But she, yeah, she stayed in the competition.

00:42:52.700 --> 00:42:53.660
 That's so good.

00:42:53.660 --> 00:42:58.940
 Uganda, for the Miss Uganda contest in 2014, you have to milk a cow.

00:42:58.940 --> 00:43:02.860
 And this was when Museveni, President of Uganda,

00:43:02.860 --> 00:43:06.700
 2014, sent the army in to run the Miss Uganda contest

00:43:06.700 --> 00:43:09.500
 because he decided they weren't promoting the right kind of values.

00:43:09.500 --> 00:43:11.580
 He was like, "He doesn't have the right priorities."

00:43:11.580 --> 00:43:15.020
 But so their questions have all been quizzed on farming techniques.

00:43:15.020 --> 00:43:18.780
 You know, which udder do you pull, which seed do you sow...?

00:43:18.780 --> 00:43:20.380
 Which udder do you pull?

00:43:20.380 --> 00:43:21.580
 Which udder do you pull?

00:43:21.580 --> 00:43:22.300
 Pull the udder one.

00:43:22.300 --> 00:43:25.260
 There we go.

00:43:25.260 --> 00:43:31.020
 And Miss Navajo, you have to know how to butcher a sheep properly.

00:43:31.020 --> 00:43:31.820
 Miss what?

00:43:31.820 --> 00:43:34.620
 Navajo, like the Native American people.

00:43:34.620 --> 00:43:37.980
 There's one question that once someone got in 2012.

00:43:37.980 --> 00:43:40.940
 They were asked, "What are you supposed to do with a sheep's head?

00:43:40.940 --> 00:43:41.980
 Any ideas?"

00:43:41.980 --> 00:43:45.100
 Depends really what your interests are, I suppose.

00:43:47.580 --> 00:43:51.500
 Is that the ventriloquism act that comes up later in the talent round?

00:43:51.500 --> 00:43:54.380
 Let's say if you want to cook it.

00:43:54.380 --> 00:43:55.180
 I'd curry it.

00:43:55.180 --> 00:43:56.780
 Sheep's head, yeah?

00:43:56.780 --> 00:43:59.100
 Yeah, you can't taste any of it in the end, can you?

00:43:59.100 --> 00:44:02.460
 Yeah, not in the Navajo people because this is all about there.

00:44:02.460 --> 00:44:06.460
 You have to know all about the Navajo customs from history.

00:44:06.460 --> 00:44:08.460
 Julianne, chocolate julienne.

00:44:08.460 --> 00:44:09.980
 No.

00:44:09.980 --> 00:44:13.340
 You wrap it in aluminium foil and put it on the fire.

00:44:13.340 --> 00:44:16.300
 Ah, can't be that old a tradition if it involves aluminium foil.

00:44:17.260 --> 00:44:20.300
 And a couple of wet wipes and you're done.

00:44:20.300 --> 00:44:24.140
 No, the person who answered that question,

00:44:24.140 --> 00:44:27.500
 even though they kind of got it right because that is the modern way of doing it,

00:44:27.500 --> 00:44:29.500
 they got booed because they answered in English

00:44:29.500 --> 00:44:32.700
 and you were supposed to answer in Navajo, but they can't remember the words.

00:44:32.700 --> 00:44:34.460
 Yeah, the Navajo for aluminium foil.

00:44:34.460 --> 00:44:38.860
 I want to talk about the outrage of beauty contests

00:44:38.860 --> 00:44:42.300
 leading to people feeling pressured to have plastic surgery,

00:44:43.500 --> 00:44:45.340
 work done when they shouldn't.

00:44:45.340 --> 00:44:47.820
 And the worst thing was this December just gone.

00:44:47.820 --> 00:44:51.900
 It was a contest in Saudi Arabia and it was the camel beauty contest

00:44:51.900 --> 00:44:55.740
 where 40 camels had to be disqualified

00:44:55.740 --> 00:44:58.220
 because they'd had Botox and facelifts.

00:44:58.220 --> 00:44:58.620
 Oh.

00:44:58.620 --> 00:45:03.900
 Those humps look suspiciously pert to me.

00:45:03.900 --> 00:45:08.780
 It's a real issue.

00:45:08.780 --> 00:45:12.380
 There's $66 million worth of prize money up for grabs,

00:45:12.380 --> 00:45:16.940
 but you are not allowed to enhance in any way the camel's heads,

00:45:16.940 --> 00:45:22.220
 necks, humps, dress or posture and dozens of breeders did.

00:45:22.220 --> 00:45:25.020
 How are they manipulating the camel's looks?

00:45:25.020 --> 00:45:28.140
 They gave them Botox to inflate their body parts.

00:45:28.140 --> 00:45:31.980
 They also had rubber bands that inflated their body parts

00:45:31.980 --> 00:45:33.100
 in ways that I don't understand.

00:45:33.100 --> 00:45:34.460
 To be honest, for this prize money,

00:45:34.460 --> 00:45:37.260
 I'm willing to dress up as a camel and go to Saudi Arabia.

00:45:37.260 --> 00:45:39.340
 Oh, well, I think you think a lot of yourself,

00:45:39.340 --> 00:45:40.940
 if you think you dressed up as a camel,

00:45:40.940 --> 00:45:43.340
 will be more attractive than an actual camel.

00:45:43.340 --> 00:45:44.220
 I do.

00:45:44.220 --> 00:45:46.860
 James, I back myself on this one.

00:45:46.860 --> 00:45:49.980
 In a camel beauty contest where you're looking for something

00:45:49.980 --> 00:45:53.420
 with two humps, a nice long face and Andy thinks,

00:45:53.420 --> 00:45:55.900
 "Nah, I could just dress up as a camel and win it."

00:45:55.900 --> 00:45:58.380
 I've got a nice long face and I think the humps,

00:45:58.380 --> 00:45:59.580
 I'll sort something out.

00:45:59.580 --> 00:46:03.020
 We've got to wrap up, guys.

00:46:03.020 --> 00:46:03.660
 Okay.

00:46:03.660 --> 00:46:06.780
 Yeah, James, do you want to lob one more thing in or are we?

00:46:06.780 --> 00:46:07.660
 I can if you want.

00:46:08.220 --> 00:46:12.220
 There is this thing in China where models will be given a job

00:46:12.220 --> 00:46:13.740
 and they'll be saying, "Oh, come over here.

00:46:13.740 --> 00:46:15.180
 It's like a modeling job."

00:46:15.180 --> 00:46:18.620
 And then they're told to pretend to be like Miss America

00:46:18.620 --> 00:46:20.380
 or Miss Brazil or whatever.

00:46:20.380 --> 00:46:23.180
 And there was someone who was from Brazil,

00:46:23.180 --> 00:46:24.940
 who was pretending to be Miss Chile.

00:46:24.940 --> 00:46:28.860
 Someone from Ukraine who was pretending to be a Miss America.

00:46:28.860 --> 00:46:30.300
 And the reason is that they take them

00:46:30.300 --> 00:46:33.420
 to these like tiny little towns in the middle of nowhere

00:46:33.420 --> 00:46:35.340
 and they say they're not going to know

00:46:35.340 --> 00:46:37.420
 what Miss America is supposed to look like.

00:46:37.420 --> 00:46:39.340
 So I'm just going to put a sash on you

00:46:39.340 --> 00:46:41.900
 and we're going to pretend that we've managed to fly in

00:46:41.900 --> 00:46:44.780
 all of these beauty contest winners from all around the world.

00:46:44.780 --> 00:46:46.540
 It's like amazing.

00:46:46.540 --> 00:46:47.180
 We're going to go.

00:46:47.180 --> 00:46:50.540
 I'm going to sign the fittest camel in Saudi Arabia 2022.

00:46:50.540 --> 00:46:56.140
 All right, look, we need to wrap up.

00:46:56.140 --> 00:46:56.860
 That is it.

00:46:56.860 --> 00:46:58.220
 That is all of our facts.

00:46:58.220 --> 00:46:59.820
