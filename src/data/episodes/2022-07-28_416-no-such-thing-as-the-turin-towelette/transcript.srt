00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,580
 (upbeat music)

2
00:00:02,580 --> 00:00:18,800
 - Hello, and welcome to another episode

3
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:20,920
 of No Such Thing as a Fish,

4
00:00:20,920 --> 00:00:25,920
 a weekly podcast this week coming to you live from Dublin.

5
00:00:27,280 --> 00:00:30,020
 (crowd cheering)

6
00:00:30,020 --> 00:00:34,760
 My name is Dan Schreiber.

7
00:00:34,760 --> 00:00:38,080
 I am sitting here with Anna Tyshinski,

8
00:00:38,080 --> 00:00:42,640
 Azure Hunts of Murray, and Jayne Markin.

9
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:46,960
 And once again, we have gathered around that microphone

10
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:50,400
 with our four favorite facts of the last seven days.

11
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:55,400
 And in that particular honor, here we go!

12
00:00:55,400 --> 00:00:58,140
 (crowd cheering)

13
00:00:58,140 --> 00:01:04,680
 Okay, calm the fuck down, everyone.

14
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:11,120
 Starting with fact number one, and that is James.

15
00:01:11,120 --> 00:01:15,200
 Okay, my fact this week is that in 1954,

16
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:18,560
 it became illegal to bathe completely naked

17
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:19,840
 in East Germany.

18
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:22,240
 So nature has started going to the beach,

19
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:24,100
 wearing nothing but a tie.

20
00:01:24,100 --> 00:01:26,860
 (crowd laughing)

21
00:01:26,860 --> 00:01:33,100
 So just before World War II,

22
00:01:33,100 --> 00:01:34,240
 we've actually said this before,

23
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:37,220
 Hitler banned natureism in the Nazi government,

24
00:01:37,220 --> 00:01:39,440
 but almost immediately unbanded

25
00:01:39,440 --> 00:01:41,500
 because it was so unpopular.

26
00:01:41,500 --> 00:01:45,900
 And then it kind of became part of the Nazi tradition

27
00:01:45,900 --> 00:01:48,720
 that we're gonna allow people to be naked

28
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:51,180
 if they want to be nudists if they want.

29
00:01:51,180 --> 00:01:54,020
 And so when East Germany became a country,

30
00:01:54,020 --> 00:01:55,940
 and they wanted to be away from the fascism

31
00:01:55,940 --> 00:01:58,420
 with the communists, they saw natureism

32
00:01:58,420 --> 00:02:01,380
 as like this fascist symbol from the past.

33
00:02:01,380 --> 00:02:03,300
 And so they decided to ban it.

34
00:02:03,300 --> 00:02:05,260
 And there's a whole load of stories

35
00:02:05,260 --> 00:02:07,300
 about what was happening with the natureists

36
00:02:07,300 --> 00:02:09,820
 who just wanted to get along with the get-off.

37
00:02:09,820 --> 00:02:11,900
 And the East German police really

38
00:02:11,900 --> 00:02:13,420
 were not happy about it at all.

39
00:02:13,420 --> 00:02:15,460
 - That's rough.

40
00:02:15,460 --> 00:02:18,100
 Nudity being taken down by fascism.

41
00:02:18,100 --> 00:02:21,340
 Unless you've got a swastika tattooed onto your penis,

42
00:02:21,340 --> 00:02:23,860
 then I don't think they're related.

43
00:02:23,860 --> 00:02:25,420
 It's not budged, it's just they are.

44
00:02:25,420 --> 00:02:27,420
 - Oh my God, I imagine that.

45
00:02:27,420 --> 00:02:29,900
 'Cause really, by the time you see the swastika

46
00:02:29,900 --> 00:02:32,420
 on the penis, it's almost too late, isn't it?

47
00:02:32,420 --> 00:02:34,540
 (laughing)

48
00:02:34,540 --> 00:02:35,380
 - Yeah.

49
00:02:35,380 --> 00:02:37,260
 - And one of the reasons why the East Germans

50
00:02:37,260 --> 00:02:39,940
 didn't like natureism is because of the main guy

51
00:02:39,940 --> 00:02:42,340
 who was in charge of German natureism.

52
00:02:42,340 --> 00:02:45,140
 He was like the leading light of German natureism, really.

53
00:02:45,140 --> 00:02:46,780
 He was called Adolf Koch.

54
00:02:49,180 --> 00:02:52,660
 Adolf Koch was an anti-drinking, anti-smoking,

55
00:02:52,660 --> 00:02:55,780
 pro-homosexuality, pro-sex outside marriage.

56
00:02:55,780 --> 00:02:56,700
 He was a pacifist.

57
00:02:56,700 --> 00:02:59,980
 He was very modern-day woke.

58
00:02:59,980 --> 00:03:01,820
 But obviously the communists

59
00:03:01,820 --> 00:03:03,340
 did not like him one little bit.

60
00:03:03,340 --> 00:03:05,460
 And so he was almost like the face,

61
00:03:05,460 --> 00:03:07,940
 I hope the face, of natureism.

62
00:03:07,940 --> 00:03:09,540
 And they really didn't like him,

63
00:03:09,540 --> 00:03:11,500
 and that was one of the reasons they stamped down on it.

64
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:12,420
 - But they couldn't, right?

65
00:03:12,420 --> 00:03:16,300
 Because in the end, Germany is this strange anomaly

66
00:03:16,300 --> 00:03:19,740
 of country, which I think makes them kind

67
00:03:19,740 --> 00:03:21,420
 of the only sane country, in a way,

68
00:03:21,420 --> 00:03:23,540
 where they're all, not they're all,

69
00:03:23,540 --> 00:03:25,740
 but more of them are much more comfortable

70
00:03:25,740 --> 00:03:29,100
 with natureism and nudity than any other countries.

71
00:03:29,100 --> 00:03:31,420
 And it's going down a little bit.

72
00:03:31,420 --> 00:03:33,500
 But yeah, and it was started in Germany

73
00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:34,700
 at the end of the 19th century.

74
00:03:34,700 --> 00:03:38,100
 It was by this guy called Karl Diefenbach,

75
00:03:38,100 --> 00:03:41,140
 who moved himself and his entire family,

76
00:03:41,140 --> 00:03:42,380
 and I'd like to know what they thought of this,

77
00:03:42,380 --> 00:03:47,380
 into an abandoned quarry where he lived with them naked.

78
00:03:47,380 --> 00:03:50,260
 And he was taken to court,

79
00:03:50,260 --> 00:03:53,380
 and then I think he was for being naked.

80
00:03:53,380 --> 00:03:55,980
 And then people agreed that it was okay.

81
00:03:55,980 --> 00:03:57,140
 And the thing then was,

82
00:03:57,140 --> 00:03:59,740
 it was to emulate ancient Greek sculptures,

83
00:03:59,740 --> 00:04:02,700
 which were considered so beautiful and shapely.

84
00:04:02,700 --> 00:04:05,780
 And so people would come to nudist parties

85
00:04:05,780 --> 00:04:07,980
 in the poses of Greek sculptures.

86
00:04:07,980 --> 00:04:09,260
 And then they'd sort of paint each other

87
00:04:09,260 --> 00:04:10,780
 and compliment each other.

88
00:04:10,780 --> 00:04:12,220
 And sounds lovely.

89
00:04:12,220 --> 00:04:13,220
 - Yeah, right. - It is.

90
00:04:13,220 --> 00:04:14,260
 - Wait, sorry, hang on.

91
00:04:14,260 --> 00:04:18,380
 Their costume was coming in the pose of a Greek later.

92
00:04:18,380 --> 00:04:19,860
 - You know, like that discus thrower?

93
00:04:19,860 --> 00:04:20,700
 You could have a discus.

94
00:04:20,700 --> 00:04:22,860
 - Yeah, but you can't arrive at a party

95
00:04:22,860 --> 00:04:24,340
 just holding a position.

96
00:04:24,340 --> 00:04:26,020
 (laughing)

97
00:04:26,020 --> 00:04:27,380
 - You have to be wheeled in.

98
00:04:27,380 --> 00:04:28,340
 - Yeah, exactly.

99
00:04:28,340 --> 00:04:29,820
 (laughing)

100
00:04:29,820 --> 00:04:32,460
 That's a lot of commitment to a party as well, I'd say.

101
00:04:32,460 --> 00:04:35,340
 You're naked and you're just not moving the entire party.

102
00:04:35,340 --> 00:04:38,540
 - Germany does have this thing of being quite passionate

103
00:04:38,540 --> 00:04:40,860
 about the freikorpo cultio,

104
00:04:40,860 --> 00:04:42,300
 which means free body culture.

105
00:04:42,300 --> 00:04:43,380
 And it's a really big thing there.

106
00:04:43,380 --> 00:04:45,260
 So there was a thing about 20 years ago

107
00:04:45,260 --> 00:04:48,340
 on the, there was a resort on the island of RÃ¼gen.

108
00:04:48,340 --> 00:04:50,340
 And there was a bit of the beach

109
00:04:50,340 --> 00:04:52,380
 that was a nudist bit of the beach.

110
00:04:52,380 --> 00:04:53,220
 And there was a bit,

111
00:04:53,220 --> 00:04:55,060
 which was the non-nudist bit of the beach.

112
00:04:55,060 --> 00:04:58,100
 And the resort hired what they called

113
00:04:58,100 --> 00:04:59,420
 (speaking in foreign language)

114
00:04:59,420 --> 00:05:01,300
 or Panties Police.

115
00:05:01,300 --> 00:05:06,060
 Who, their job was to ask people who were nudists

116
00:05:06,060 --> 00:05:08,780
 who had strayed into the clothes section of the beach

117
00:05:08,780 --> 00:05:11,260
 to please go back to the nudist section of the beach.

118
00:05:11,260 --> 00:05:13,620
 But their other job was to approach clothes people

119
00:05:13,620 --> 00:05:15,140
 in the nudist section of the beach

120
00:05:15,140 --> 00:05:17,420
 and say, get them off.

121
00:05:17,420 --> 00:05:18,260
 (laughing)

122
00:05:18,260 --> 00:05:19,500
 - Oh man.

123
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:21,500
 Surely they'd say go back to the clothes section.

124
00:05:21,500 --> 00:05:23,780
 - I think they basically gave them a choice.

125
00:05:23,780 --> 00:05:25,940
 They said, you can keep that or you can stay here,

126
00:05:25,940 --> 00:05:26,940
 but you can't do both.

127
00:05:26,940 --> 00:05:27,780
 - That's amazing.

128
00:05:27,780 --> 00:05:28,620
 - Yeah.

129
00:05:28,620 --> 00:05:29,460
 - Wasn't there a story,

130
00:05:29,460 --> 00:05:30,780
 I haven't written this down so I don't know the details,

131
00:05:30,780 --> 00:05:32,580
 but wasn't there a story of someone robbing

132
00:05:32,580 --> 00:05:34,180
 either a shop or a bank?

133
00:05:34,180 --> 00:05:36,660
 And as they ran out, they leapt over a fence

134
00:05:36,660 --> 00:05:38,620
 to try and integrate with the people around there,

135
00:05:38,620 --> 00:05:39,740
 but it was a nudist camp.

136
00:05:39,740 --> 00:05:40,580
 (laughing)

137
00:05:40,580 --> 00:05:43,700
 And the police came in, it spotted him immediately,

138
00:05:43,700 --> 00:05:44,780
 only doing the clothes on.

139
00:05:44,780 --> 00:05:46,300
 - In nudist resorts, the shoplifting

140
00:05:46,300 --> 00:05:47,860
 is genuinely very low.

141
00:05:47,860 --> 00:05:50,460
 As in, because where are you gonna put it?

142
00:05:50,460 --> 00:05:53,380
 - You're only gonna hide things that are very thin.

143
00:05:53,380 --> 00:05:54,220
 - Absolutely.

144
00:05:54,220 --> 00:05:55,820
 (laughing)

145
00:05:55,820 --> 00:05:57,260
 You can steal some cigarette papers,

146
00:05:57,260 --> 00:05:58,980
 but that's it, really.

147
00:05:58,980 --> 00:06:00,580
 - And no one's smoking those cigarettes.

148
00:06:00,580 --> 00:06:03,300
 (laughing)

149
00:06:03,300 --> 00:06:06,540
 That's like Cape Dagde, which is a French holiday resort.

150
00:06:06,540 --> 00:06:07,380
 - Yeah.

151
00:06:07,380 --> 00:06:10,140
 - Which I didn't know about, but it's a full on naked town.

152
00:06:10,140 --> 00:06:13,540
 And in the summer, the population reaches 40,000,

153
00:06:13,540 --> 00:06:15,860
 which I guess is just mostly visitors.

154
00:06:15,860 --> 00:06:18,820
 But it's quite odd because the visitors

155
00:06:18,820 --> 00:06:20,740
 don't wear any clothes, so everyone's naked,

156
00:06:20,740 --> 00:06:22,900
 but there are lots of shops and the post office

157
00:06:22,900 --> 00:06:24,300
 and banks and stuff like that.

158
00:06:24,300 --> 00:06:26,420
 And all the people who are serving them

159
00:06:26,420 --> 00:06:28,580
 in those places are fully clothed.

160
00:06:28,580 --> 00:06:32,100
 So it's very surreal, like lots of naked customers,

161
00:06:32,100 --> 00:06:34,660
 and they're just in uniform bank teller,

162
00:06:34,660 --> 00:06:38,220
 giving them their money that they can't keep anywhere.

163
00:06:38,220 --> 00:06:42,260
 But yeah, there's very little crime,

164
00:06:42,260 --> 00:06:44,220
 and they refer to the closed people

165
00:06:44,220 --> 00:06:47,500
 that you can see on the opposite bank as textiles.

166
00:06:47,500 --> 00:06:49,820
 (laughing)

167
00:06:49,820 --> 00:06:51,420
 - That plays Cape Dagde.

168
00:06:51,420 --> 00:06:53,620
 I think it's having a bit of an identity crisis

169
00:06:53,620 --> 00:06:55,820
 at the moment, because it's turned into a very sexy place.

170
00:06:55,820 --> 00:06:58,500
 And swingers are starting to turn up.

171
00:06:58,500 --> 00:07:01,020
 And the nudists are a bit put out about this,

172
00:07:01,020 --> 00:07:05,460
 because, A, naturism is not about sex or sexiness,

173
00:07:05,460 --> 00:07:09,660
 it's about being natural and feeling your body in nature.

174
00:07:09,660 --> 00:07:11,300
 - I don't think it's a completely

175
00:07:11,300 --> 00:07:14,100
 incomplete Venn diagram, though, is there?

176
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:15,260
 - Well, yeah, this is the thing.

177
00:07:15,260 --> 00:07:17,700
 So the naturists genuinely are saying we're not swingers,

178
00:07:17,700 --> 00:07:18,540
 and the swingers are turning up,

179
00:07:18,540 --> 00:07:19,820
 but the other thing is that the swingers turn up

180
00:07:19,820 --> 00:07:22,620
 and wear sexy clothes, and the naturists hate this.

181
00:07:22,620 --> 00:07:24,060
 - Oh, really? - Yeah.

182
00:07:24,060 --> 00:07:25,580
 - Yeah, so when we're saying most of the shops

183
00:07:25,580 --> 00:07:27,100
 that are weirded clothes shops,

184
00:07:27,100 --> 00:07:30,060
 but they're selling kind of S&M fetish.

185
00:07:30,060 --> 00:07:31,900
 - Excellent chat. - That sort of stuff.

186
00:07:31,900 --> 00:07:33,140
 - Exactly. - Yeah.

187
00:07:33,140 --> 00:07:36,020
 - Which absolutely is not what naturism is, really.

188
00:07:36,020 --> 00:07:38,340
 It's about kind of innocence and being freed

189
00:07:38,340 --> 00:07:41,020
 from these constraints of, anyway,

190
00:07:41,020 --> 00:07:43,620
 you know, look, I've got a speech I'm giving afterwards.

191
00:07:43,620 --> 00:07:46,540
 (laughing)

192
00:07:46,540 --> 00:07:47,900
 - Can I ask a very stupid question?

193
00:07:47,900 --> 00:07:49,020
 This is a genuinely stupid question,

194
00:07:49,020 --> 00:07:50,700
 but if you were a naturist,

195
00:07:50,700 --> 00:07:53,740
 would seeing someone in clothes

196
00:07:53,740 --> 00:07:57,060
 be the equivalent of a sexy magazine?

197
00:07:57,060 --> 00:08:01,020
 - I think... - Is the opposite of what...

198
00:08:01,020 --> 00:08:01,980
 (laughing)

199
00:08:01,980 --> 00:08:04,780
 - Is like their playboy just, I don't know.

200
00:08:04,780 --> 00:08:06,100
 - They go to clubs, actually,

201
00:08:06,100 --> 00:08:08,740
 and they watch people wearing heavy tweeds

202
00:08:08,740 --> 00:08:09,900
 dance around the pole.

203
00:08:09,900 --> 00:08:12,060
 (laughing)

204
00:08:12,060 --> 00:08:13,820
 - There was a bit of a moral panic

205
00:08:13,820 --> 00:08:15,380
 back in the East German days,

206
00:08:15,380 --> 00:08:16,300
 what I'm talking about now.

207
00:08:16,300 --> 00:08:20,380
 So there was a moral panic that people who were clothed

208
00:08:20,380 --> 00:08:23,180
 and were walking past the German naturists

209
00:08:23,180 --> 00:08:25,020
 were having their clothes stolen

210
00:08:25,020 --> 00:08:27,460
 and being thrown into the sea.

211
00:08:27,460 --> 00:08:28,540
 And there were a few reports,

212
00:08:28,540 --> 00:08:30,060
 and we think it probably didn't happen,

213
00:08:30,060 --> 00:08:32,260
 but they were just fake reports that it was happening.

214
00:08:32,260 --> 00:08:33,740
 - Wait, clothed people?

215
00:08:33,740 --> 00:08:35,300
 - So you're a normal clothed person,

216
00:08:35,300 --> 00:08:37,220
 just going about your business in Germany.

217
00:08:37,220 --> 00:08:39,620
 Aye, aye, aye, aye, aye.

218
00:08:39,620 --> 00:08:42,020
 And then suddenly a load of naked people come along,

219
00:08:42,020 --> 00:08:43,460
 they grab all of your clothes,

220
00:08:43,460 --> 00:08:44,620
 they rip them off and say,

221
00:08:44,620 --> 00:08:45,900
 "This is a naked place,"

222
00:08:45,900 --> 00:08:48,100
 and then they throw you in the sea.

223
00:08:48,100 --> 00:08:50,020
 - Wow. - They throw you in the sea.

224
00:08:50,020 --> 00:08:51,220
 - Yeah.

225
00:08:51,220 --> 00:08:52,780
 Genuinely, that was one of the reasons

226
00:08:52,780 --> 00:08:53,780
 why they tried to panic,

227
00:08:53,780 --> 00:08:55,540
 because this kind of moral panic came,

228
00:08:55,540 --> 00:08:57,460
 and it was in the newspapers that this was happening,

229
00:08:57,460 --> 00:08:58,860
 and everyone's like, "Oh, my God,

230
00:08:58,860 --> 00:09:00,860
 "I'm just going to be walking down the streets in Berlin

231
00:09:00,860 --> 00:09:02,300
 "and people are going to rip my clothes off.

232
00:09:02,300 --> 00:09:04,180
 "We need to stop these naturists now."

233
00:09:04,180 --> 00:09:05,500
 - Good identity parades you'd have

234
00:09:05,500 --> 00:09:07,620
 at the end of all that, wouldn't you?

235
00:09:07,620 --> 00:09:09,700
 I recognise that swastika right there.

236
00:09:09,700 --> 00:09:13,420
 Can you ask him to do the salute?

237
00:09:13,420 --> 00:09:18,060
 - Oh, my God.

238
00:09:18,060 --> 00:09:22,060
 - There was some small justification to being paranoid

239
00:09:22,060 --> 00:09:25,300
 about it being co-opted by well-perverts.

240
00:09:25,300 --> 00:09:27,940
 So in the 1930s, when the movement started to take off,

241
00:09:27,940 --> 00:09:29,660
 there were fewer than 10,000 members

242
00:09:29,660 --> 00:09:32,580
 of the Natureism Society in the UK,

243
00:09:32,580 --> 00:09:36,340
 but the second issue of Sunbathing Review,

244
00:09:36,340 --> 00:09:39,140
 which was the euphemistic name for the nudist magazine,

245
00:09:39,140 --> 00:09:41,300
 sold 50,000 copies,

246
00:09:41,300 --> 00:09:42,700
 and there was a small suspicion

247
00:09:42,700 --> 00:09:44,260
 that some of the people buying that

248
00:09:44,260 --> 00:09:45,540
 were not actually nudists,

249
00:09:45,540 --> 00:09:47,980
 they just wanted to see loads of naked people,

250
00:09:47,980 --> 00:09:48,940
 which makes sense.

251
00:09:48,940 --> 00:09:50,500
 And photographers for that magazine

252
00:09:50,500 --> 00:09:52,500
 used to ship models to nudist beaches,

253
00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:54,700
 take photographs of them, and then leave.

254
00:09:54,700 --> 00:09:56,220
 - But that was a big thing, wasn't it?

255
00:09:56,220 --> 00:09:57,820
 So around the world now,

256
00:09:57,820 --> 00:10:00,380
 the article that I read, there may be more now,

257
00:10:00,380 --> 00:10:04,020
 but there's four nudist libraries in the world today.

258
00:10:04,020 --> 00:10:04,860
 - Really?

259
00:10:04,860 --> 00:10:07,260
 - So a nudist library, it's a combination of two things.

260
00:10:07,260 --> 00:10:09,660
 One is, it's a library about nudity.

261
00:10:09,660 --> 00:10:12,700
 So it's just got magazines, it's got books,

262
00:10:12,700 --> 00:10:14,020
 anything that is about nudity.

263
00:10:14,020 --> 00:10:16,460
 So the magazines that they have are not Playboy

264
00:10:16,460 --> 00:10:17,860
 or anything to do with sexuality,

265
00:10:17,860 --> 00:10:19,180
 but in the '60s and '70s,

266
00:10:19,180 --> 00:10:21,500
 there was a boom when a law got taken down

267
00:10:21,500 --> 00:10:24,500
 to say that nakedness could be represented in magazines,

268
00:10:24,500 --> 00:10:27,660
 and a lot of magazines with nudity were printed,

269
00:10:27,660 --> 00:10:30,940
 and so this is a library that has all of that,

270
00:10:30,940 --> 00:10:33,420
 but you are allowed to be naked in it as well.

271
00:10:33,420 --> 00:10:36,540
 It's a nudist, nudist library.

272
00:10:36,540 --> 00:10:38,380
 - Here's one thing that happens to nudists.

273
00:10:38,380 --> 00:10:39,820
 This is according to Stefan Duchenne,

274
00:10:39,820 --> 00:10:41,860
 who is the new co-president

275
00:10:41,860 --> 00:10:44,060
 of the International Nudism Federation.

276
00:10:44,060 --> 00:10:45,700
 He was interviewed recently about nudism,

277
00:10:45,700 --> 00:10:47,540
 and he said that one thing you can get

278
00:10:47,540 --> 00:10:52,420
 if you're a nudist is you get phantom clothes, okay?

279
00:10:52,420 --> 00:10:54,340
 He said after decades of...

280
00:10:54,340 --> 00:10:55,180
 This is the article.

281
00:10:55,180 --> 00:10:57,380
 After decades of living as a naturist,

282
00:10:57,380 --> 00:10:59,540
 Duchenne still sometimes reaches to pull up

283
00:10:59,540 --> 00:11:02,620
 his non-existent pants after using the restroom.

284
00:11:02,620 --> 00:11:05,740
 - How was that? - Yeah, I see it.

285
00:11:05,740 --> 00:11:07,300
 I see that, that makes sense.

286
00:11:07,300 --> 00:11:08,380
 - Yeah. - Yeah.

287
00:11:08,380 --> 00:11:10,780
 - Do you know, so when I was looking at this fact,

288
00:11:10,780 --> 00:11:13,260
 I literally, I think I typed in something as simple

289
00:11:13,260 --> 00:11:17,060
 into Google to kick off as naturism history,

290
00:11:17,060 --> 00:11:21,300
 and one of the first results was naturist cleaners,

291
00:11:21,300 --> 00:11:26,260
 which is the UK's leading naturist nude cleaning service.

292
00:11:26,260 --> 00:11:27,740
 I cannot believe this exists,

293
00:11:27,740 --> 00:11:30,260
 so naked people come to clean your house,

294
00:11:30,260 --> 00:11:32,900
 and it's a professional cleaning service.

295
00:11:32,900 --> 00:11:35,540
 - I mean, I feel like I would have to hire another cleaner

296
00:11:35,540 --> 00:11:37,860
 for whatever they'd start.

297
00:11:37,860 --> 00:11:42,100
 It's like, oh my God, no, no, no, don't sit there, don't sit there.

298
00:11:42,100 --> 00:11:44,180
 - They don't arrive at your door naked, though.

299
00:11:44,180 --> 00:11:45,020
 - That's a really good question.

300
00:11:45,020 --> 00:11:46,620
 I don't know if they do,

301
00:11:46,620 --> 00:11:48,260
 because you're not, that's illegal, isn't it?

302
00:11:48,260 --> 00:11:50,180
 So they must arrive in maybe a trench.

303
00:11:50,180 --> 00:11:51,020
 - It's not illegal, it's not illegal.

304
00:11:51,020 --> 00:11:51,860
 - It's not illegal. - It's not illegal.

305
00:11:51,860 --> 00:11:54,660
 - It is actually, it is here in Ireland.

306
00:11:54,660 --> 00:11:55,500
 - Is it? - In Nuttas.

307
00:11:55,500 --> 00:11:59,140
 - Yeah, Ireland hosted the 2014 34th

308
00:11:59,140 --> 00:12:00,620
 International Naturist Congress,

309
00:12:00,620 --> 00:12:03,420
 despite it being technically banned by law.

310
00:12:03,420 --> 00:12:04,820
 - Yeah. - You've proved.

311
00:12:04,820 --> 00:12:07,460
 - You have a series, a selection of secret coves

312
00:12:07,460 --> 00:12:11,900
 that Irish nudists go to, and it's all done...

313
00:12:11,900 --> 00:12:13,260
 - See you all after the show.

314
00:12:13,260 --> 00:12:14,580
 - Yeah.

315
00:12:14,580 --> 00:12:16,860
 - So is it, Andy, is it, if we were back in London,

316
00:12:16,860 --> 00:12:18,620
 is it legal for us to just walk around?

317
00:12:18,620 --> 00:12:20,180
 - It's legal. - According to the website

318
00:12:20,180 --> 00:12:23,900
 of the Great British Take-Off from last year,

319
00:12:23,900 --> 00:12:28,580
 they are very, very clear on the front page.

320
00:12:28,580 --> 00:12:30,740
 By the way, it's perfectly legal.

321
00:12:30,740 --> 00:12:33,340
 They said, "By all means, tell the neighbours,

322
00:12:33,340 --> 00:12:36,700
 "but there is no need to warn them, even if you're overlooked.

323
00:12:36,700 --> 00:12:38,660
 "So long as you are not revealing yourself

324
00:12:38,660 --> 00:12:41,700
 "with the intention of upsetting people, it's fine."

325
00:12:41,700 --> 00:12:44,220
 - Yeah, I was intending to delight people.

326
00:12:45,220 --> 00:12:47,260
 - Yeah, it's that, it's a great idea.

327
00:12:47,260 --> 00:12:49,780
 - By the way, the Great British Take-Off, last year's,

328
00:12:49,780 --> 00:12:51,580
 they gave you some ideas of what you could do.

329
00:12:51,580 --> 00:12:54,220
 They're basically saying, "Take your clothes off in your garden."

330
00:12:54,220 --> 00:12:56,980
 They say, "You could sunbathe, read, sit in a hot tub,

331
00:12:56,980 --> 00:12:58,580
 "you can have a barbecue,

332
00:12:58,580 --> 00:13:01,300
 "you can kick a ball around through a frisbee."

333
00:13:01,300 --> 00:13:03,500
 - Do we kick the other ball around?

334
00:13:03,500 --> 00:13:08,540
 - "Do a jigsaw puzzle or listen to a podcast."

335
00:13:08,540 --> 00:13:10,020
 - Oh. - Oh.

336
00:13:10,020 --> 00:13:12,900
 - So if anyone's listening to this one in the net...

337
00:13:13,860 --> 00:13:17,180
 - Hi to you. - Take a photo right now and send it to us.

338
00:13:17,180 --> 00:13:19,500
 Right now. Do it.

339
00:13:19,500 --> 00:13:23,380
 - You can do that on the street, in a shop or whatever.

340
00:13:23,380 --> 00:13:26,380
 'Cause in your garden, obviously, I can do anything in my garden.

341
00:13:26,380 --> 00:13:28,180
 - In theory, it's legal.

342
00:13:28,180 --> 00:13:31,060
 - Tesco can't kick me out if I go there.

343
00:13:31,060 --> 00:13:33,940
 - Tesco's a private company. - I have a property there.

344
00:13:33,940 --> 00:13:35,540
 - I think the police would take an interest

345
00:13:35,540 --> 00:13:37,700
 if you'd just walk around the centre of town.

346
00:13:37,700 --> 00:13:39,780
 - Okay, but a hospital, not private,

347
00:13:39,780 --> 00:13:41,700
 NHS, publicly funded,

348
00:13:41,700 --> 00:13:44,780
 if I walk into a hospital but naked for no good reason,

349
00:13:44,780 --> 00:13:46,380
 they can't do anything about it.

350
00:13:46,380 --> 00:13:47,940
 - I think you'd have to wear a mask.

351
00:13:47,940 --> 00:13:49,420
 - Yeah.

352
00:13:49,420 --> 00:13:57,340
 - All right, look, we need to move on to our next fact.

353
00:13:57,340 --> 00:14:01,180
 It is time for fact number two, and that is...

354
00:14:01,180 --> 00:14:04,220
 - Andy. - My fact is that in 1998,

355
00:14:04,220 --> 00:14:08,860
 one-tenth of everything sold on eBay was a beanie baby.

356
00:14:10,580 --> 00:14:12,740
 - One-tenth, 10%... - Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

357
00:14:12,740 --> 00:14:14,580
 So if I bought a handbag,

358
00:14:14,580 --> 00:14:16,140
 one-tenth of it would be a beanie baby.

359
00:14:16,140 --> 00:14:17,260
 - That's right.

360
00:14:17,260 --> 00:14:18,660
 It would almost all be handbag,

361
00:14:18,660 --> 00:14:22,540
 but the strap and one of the pockets would be beamed.

362
00:14:22,540 --> 00:14:24,060
 This is a fact about beanie babies,

363
00:14:24,060 --> 00:14:27,700
 which, for a while, everyone was insane about.

364
00:14:27,700 --> 00:14:30,580
 But any younger listeners who missed out on the beanie baby craze,

365
00:14:30,580 --> 00:14:33,740
 they're just little stuffed bears full of plastic pellets.

366
00:14:33,740 --> 00:14:35,340
 That's it. - But that was the difference,

367
00:14:35,340 --> 00:14:38,540
 'cause every bear, prior to that, or any stuffed animal,

368
00:14:38,540 --> 00:14:41,460
 was completely stuffed to the hilt, and there was no bend.

369
00:14:41,460 --> 00:14:44,260
 But these little beans meant you could move it and you could do things.

370
00:14:44,260 --> 00:14:46,860
 - Yeah. - It was almost like it was alive, wasn't it,

371
00:14:46,860 --> 00:14:48,540
 'cause it could move around in different ways.

372
00:14:48,540 --> 00:14:51,140
 - Exactly. - It wasn't like it was alive.

373
00:14:51,140 --> 00:14:52,780
 It was just floppy.

374
00:14:52,780 --> 00:14:54,460
 It was a floppy teddy.

375
00:14:54,460 --> 00:14:56,500
 And to be fair, I hadn't actually realised,

376
00:14:56,500 --> 00:14:59,740
 until researching this fact, that that was the innovation.

377
00:14:59,740 --> 00:15:01,220
 You know, 'cause you grow up with beanie babies,

378
00:15:01,220 --> 00:15:02,900
 you think, "It's always been like this.

379
00:15:02,900 --> 00:15:05,780
 "Was there ever a time before this kind of vibe?"

380
00:15:05,780 --> 00:15:06,860
 But, yeah, before that,

381
00:15:06,860 --> 00:15:08,500
 teddy bears were just like...

382
00:15:08,500 --> 00:15:10,420
 - "Buff!" - In fairness.

383
00:15:10,420 --> 00:15:13,260
 - Constipated. - It's Iwana who invented them, right?

384
00:15:13,260 --> 00:15:14,260
 He was the guy who invented them.

385
00:15:14,260 --> 00:15:18,260
 He did say the whole idea was it looked real because it moved.

386
00:15:18,260 --> 00:15:21,300
 He thought these looked like actual bears.

387
00:15:21,300 --> 00:15:22,900
 - Yeah. - Mmm.

388
00:15:22,900 --> 00:15:24,300
 - So, in 1998,

389
00:15:24,300 --> 00:15:28,620
 64% of American adults owned at least one beanie baby.

390
00:15:28,620 --> 00:15:31,860
 - That is ridiculous. I saw that, and I didn't believe it.

391
00:15:31,860 --> 00:15:35,940
 In 1997, 64%, like you say, owned a beanie baby,

392
00:15:35,940 --> 00:15:40,260
 but 48% of Americans in 1997 believed in global warming.

393
00:15:40,260 --> 00:15:43,740
 - Uh-huh. - 53% trusted the media,

394
00:15:43,740 --> 00:15:47,420
 and 15% had a passport.

395
00:15:47,420 --> 00:15:50,420
 That's compared with 64% who had a beanie baby.

396
00:15:50,420 --> 00:15:51,540
 - Well, why... - Wow.

397
00:15:51,540 --> 00:15:52,660
 - You don't need to leave the country

398
00:15:52,660 --> 00:15:55,460
 when you've got these lovely beanie babies to identify you.

399
00:15:55,460 --> 00:15:57,740
 They started off, so, Tai Wano, who James just mentioned,

400
00:15:57,740 --> 00:15:59,660
 he was the man behind them,

401
00:15:59,660 --> 00:16:02,460
 and he had limited success with them, really.

402
00:16:02,460 --> 00:16:04,940
 He released a few, and they were doing all right.

403
00:16:04,940 --> 00:16:08,660
 And then, in 1995, two years after they launched,

404
00:16:08,660 --> 00:16:09,940
 he discontinued one of them.

405
00:16:09,940 --> 00:16:11,540
 There were problems with the factory

406
00:16:11,540 --> 00:16:13,100
 where they were being made overseas,

407
00:16:13,100 --> 00:16:15,740
 so he thought, "Right, sod it. We'll just kill off Lovey the Lamb."

408
00:16:15,740 --> 00:16:18,420
 And suddenly, people were desperate for Lovey the Lamb,

409
00:16:18,420 --> 00:16:19,740
 and he realised, "Oh, we're not going to say

410
00:16:19,740 --> 00:16:20,940
 "there are problems with the supplier.

411
00:16:20,940 --> 00:16:21,980
 "We can't get any of these."

412
00:16:21,980 --> 00:16:24,220
 - And we also won't say we killed it off.

413
00:16:24,220 --> 00:16:26,100
 - That's true. - It's true.

414
00:16:26,100 --> 00:16:27,020
 Well, yes, you're right.

415
00:16:27,020 --> 00:16:29,580
 He said, specifically, it's been retired,

416
00:16:29,580 --> 00:16:32,340
 so that suddenly created this huge demand for Lovey the Lamb,

417
00:16:32,340 --> 00:16:34,780
 and that became the entire business model behind the beanie baby.

418
00:16:34,780 --> 00:16:37,020
 There were hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of different models

419
00:16:37,020 --> 00:16:39,500
 by the end, which were being brought in, phased out.

420
00:16:39,500 --> 00:16:42,740
 It was incredibly hard to keep track of where they all were

421
00:16:42,740 --> 00:16:44,180
 and to have a full set.

422
00:16:44,180 --> 00:16:46,620
 But it's almost weirdly responsible, as well,

423
00:16:46,620 --> 00:16:48,460
 for the fact that we have eBay now,

424
00:16:48,460 --> 00:16:50,020
 as in we had eBay at the time,

425
00:16:50,020 --> 00:16:53,380
 but in 1998, eBay had 30 employees.

426
00:16:53,380 --> 00:16:55,340
 There were half a million users on it,

427
00:16:55,340 --> 00:16:59,340
 so the 10% of it was 10% of half a million users.

428
00:16:59,340 --> 00:17:00,700
 - What is that? - What is what?

429
00:17:00,700 --> 00:17:02,220
 10% of half a million.

430
00:17:02,220 --> 00:17:03,380
 (LAUGHTER)

431
00:17:03,380 --> 00:17:05,300
 That's not what you came for.

432
00:17:05,300 --> 00:17:07,260
 You didn't come for a maths test, Dan.

433
00:17:07,260 --> 00:17:09,020
 - Good point. - Go on, I apologise.

434
00:17:09,020 --> 00:17:11,020
 (LAUGHTER)

435
00:17:11,020 --> 00:17:12,180
 It's like your worst nightmare.

436
00:17:12,180 --> 00:17:14,620
 Someone give you a percentage question on stage

437
00:17:14,620 --> 00:17:15,460
 of one in 500 people.

438
00:17:15,460 --> 00:17:16,700
 Even though it's really easy,

439
00:17:16,700 --> 00:17:17,900
 because there's so many people here,

440
00:17:17,900 --> 00:17:19,780
 I can't work out what it is in my head.

441
00:17:19,780 --> 00:17:21,540
 (LAUGHTER)

442
00:17:21,540 --> 00:17:23,060
 It's a nightmare.

443
00:17:23,060 --> 00:17:25,580
 Well, you're not the CEO of eBay.

444
00:17:25,580 --> 00:17:27,620
 - You don't need to know these numbers. - Exactly.

445
00:17:27,620 --> 00:17:29,540
 Anna, you are one sick puffy.

446
00:17:29,540 --> 00:17:31,260
 (LAUGHTER)

447
00:17:31,260 --> 00:17:32,260
 It's 50,000.

448
00:17:32,260 --> 00:17:34,940
 - OK, let's move on. - Of course it's 50,000.

449
00:17:34,940 --> 00:17:36,420
 We all knew that.

450
00:17:36,420 --> 00:17:37,580
 (LAUGHTER)

451
00:17:37,580 --> 00:17:39,540
 But so... Thank you.

452
00:17:39,540 --> 00:17:41,380
 (LAUGHTER)

453
00:17:41,380 --> 00:17:43,620
 When eBay went public, here was the thing.

454
00:17:43,620 --> 00:17:47,140
 They were so desperately clinging on to this fad,

455
00:17:47,140 --> 00:17:49,980
 helping them, because that was bringing in such a huge bit of revenue

456
00:17:49,980 --> 00:17:53,540
 that even in the risk factors section of their annual report,

457
00:17:53,540 --> 00:17:56,100
 it was noted their absolute dependence

458
00:17:56,100 --> 00:17:58,860
 on the continued strength of the beanie baby.

459
00:17:58,860 --> 00:18:00,700
 - Wow. - They were like, "This has to keep going."

460
00:18:00,700 --> 00:18:04,500
 And it did, and everyone, Ty Warner and the owners of eBay,

461
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:05,860
 all became billionaires.

462
00:18:05,860 --> 00:18:08,620
 Ty Warner's genius was in marketing.

463
00:18:08,620 --> 00:18:11,340
 Obviously, this false scarcity bullshit,

464
00:18:11,340 --> 00:18:13,780
 which, by the way, we're all falling for again

465
00:18:13,780 --> 00:18:16,300
 with that weird word game that everyone's obsessed with.

466
00:18:16,300 --> 00:18:17,500
 Aren't we now?

467
00:18:17,500 --> 00:18:18,500
 So...

468
00:18:18,500 --> 00:18:21,580
 Oh, one a day, suddenly I really wanted.

469
00:18:21,580 --> 00:18:22,580
 (LAUGHTER)

470
00:18:22,580 --> 00:18:24,140
 You know what I'm talking about.

471
00:18:24,140 --> 00:18:27,460
 So he had some other weird marketing tricks.

472
00:18:27,460 --> 00:18:30,220
 Ty, he wouldn't sell beanie babies to big stores

473
00:18:30,220 --> 00:18:31,660
 like Toys R Us or Walmart.

474
00:18:31,660 --> 00:18:34,460
 He would only sell them to kind of small shops.

475
00:18:34,460 --> 00:18:36,980
 And he made the stores that he sold them to promise

476
00:18:36,980 --> 00:18:39,620
 not to sell more than a few to a single customer.

477
00:18:39,620 --> 00:18:41,660
 So, you know, you reached a limit.

478
00:18:41,660 --> 00:18:44,220
 And, you know, he'd monitor the stores really obsessively

479
00:18:44,220 --> 00:18:45,980
 and they'd be under strict instructions,

480
00:18:45,980 --> 00:18:47,620
 so, like, not discount any.

481
00:18:47,620 --> 00:18:49,340
 If you discounted a beanie baby,

482
00:18:49,340 --> 00:18:51,900
 you got all your supplies whipped away from you.

483
00:18:51,900 --> 00:18:53,180
 It sounds kind of terrifying,

484
00:18:53,180 --> 00:18:55,460
 and shop owners would call him and beg for stock.

485
00:18:55,460 --> 00:18:58,100
 And the only time he'd give them what they wanted

486
00:18:58,100 --> 00:19:00,420
 is if they had a private chat with him

487
00:19:00,420 --> 00:19:02,340
 about what customers were responding to

488
00:19:02,340 --> 00:19:04,420
 and what they were liking about certain ones.

489
00:19:04,420 --> 00:19:06,100
 Wow. It was, like, gangster.

490
00:19:06,100 --> 00:19:07,860
 It's very... It is a bit mafioso, yeah.

491
00:19:07,860 --> 00:19:09,780
 Yeah. There was a... There was a scheme.

492
00:19:09,780 --> 00:19:10,780
 Allegedly.

493
00:19:10,780 --> 00:19:12,580
 (LAUGHTER)

494
00:19:12,580 --> 00:19:13,780
 I think he was in the mob.

495
00:19:13,780 --> 00:19:14,780
 Um...

496
00:19:14,780 --> 00:19:15,780
 (LAUGHTER)

497
00:19:15,780 --> 00:19:16,780
 Anyway...

498
00:19:16,780 --> 00:19:17,780
 Um...

499
00:19:17,780 --> 00:19:19,780
 There was a thing in Illinois in 1998

500
00:19:19,780 --> 00:19:20,900
 where there was a police force,

501
00:19:20,900 --> 00:19:23,860
 a small police force in a place called Kankakee, Illinois, right?

502
00:19:23,860 --> 00:19:26,660
 They said that if you have an illegal gun,

503
00:19:26,660 --> 00:19:28,340
 but you hand it into us,

504
00:19:28,340 --> 00:19:30,860
 you will get a free teeny beanie baby.

505
00:19:30,860 --> 00:19:31,860
 (LAUGHTER)

506
00:19:31,860 --> 00:19:32,860
 No way!

507
00:19:32,860 --> 00:19:34,900
 There was a special small beanie baby that had been made.

508
00:19:34,900 --> 00:19:36,860
 They got 40 people handing in guns

509
00:19:36,860 --> 00:19:37,860
 (LAUGHTER)

510
00:19:37,860 --> 00:19:38,860
 on the center of Beanie Baby.

511
00:19:38,860 --> 00:19:39,860
 But they were huge!

512
00:19:39,860 --> 00:19:42,940
 Like, yeah, the resale value of the teeny...

513
00:19:42,940 --> 00:19:45,380
 or any of the beanie babies was massive.

514
00:19:45,380 --> 00:19:46,380
 And there was...

515
00:19:46,380 --> 00:19:48,820
 OK, yes, he went with the independent stores to begin with,

516
00:19:48,820 --> 00:19:51,340
 but one big decisive moment for the company

517
00:19:51,340 --> 00:19:53,740
 was when he paired up with McDonald's for the Happy Meal.

518
00:19:53,740 --> 00:19:55,140
 And so he did the Happy Meal,

519
00:19:55,140 --> 00:19:57,460
 and they were teeny beanie babies,

520
00:19:57,460 --> 00:19:59,060
 and they did 100 million of them,

521
00:19:59,060 --> 00:20:00,500
 and they just went so quick.

522
00:20:00,500 --> 00:20:02,500
 And it caused chaos for McDonald's.

523
00:20:02,500 --> 00:20:06,180
 McDonald's were saying that people were ordering 100 Happy Meals

524
00:20:06,180 --> 00:20:09,220
 and saying, "Keep the food. We just need the babies."

525
00:20:09,220 --> 00:20:10,220
 (LAUGHTER)

526
00:20:10,220 --> 00:20:12,660
 They did television adverts

527
00:20:12,660 --> 00:20:15,060
 over the worry that massive crowds were coming

528
00:20:15,060 --> 00:20:17,420
 and the safety of the employees were in jeopardy.

529
00:20:17,420 --> 00:20:19,660
 They were like, "Please, stop."

530
00:20:19,660 --> 00:20:22,100
 It got to the point where people were calling up to order things,

531
00:20:22,100 --> 00:20:24,300
 and the people were answering the phone by saying,

532
00:20:24,300 --> 00:20:27,020
 "Good morning, McDonald's. We have the moose and the lamb."

533
00:20:27,020 --> 00:20:28,500
 (LAUGHTER)

534
00:20:28,500 --> 00:20:31,500
 But then, surely, you want either the beef or the chicken, usually.

535
00:20:31,500 --> 00:20:32,980
 (LAUGHTER)

536
00:20:32,980 --> 00:20:34,980
 It's going to be confusing.

537
00:20:34,980 --> 00:20:39,580
 I have a tangentially-related gun fact, since Andy mentioned guns.

538
00:20:39,580 --> 00:20:40,580
 Yeah, cool.

539
00:20:40,580 --> 00:20:43,220
 Ty Warner was called H. Ty Warner, right?

540
00:20:43,220 --> 00:20:45,820
 That was his full name, and the H in his name,

541
00:20:45,820 --> 00:20:48,020
 he said, just didn't stand for anything.

542
00:20:48,020 --> 00:20:52,420
 But the reason he was called Ty was because he was named after Ty Cobb,

543
00:20:52,420 --> 00:20:54,820
 who was a famous baseball player.

544
00:20:54,820 --> 00:20:57,060
 So then, I just got distracted reading about Ty Cobb.

545
00:20:57,060 --> 00:20:58,980
 But I found some weird similarities.

546
00:20:58,980 --> 00:21:00,220
 Ty Cobb's story is amazing.

547
00:21:00,220 --> 00:21:02,300
 He was a baseball player at the turn of the 20th century,

548
00:21:02,300 --> 00:21:03,900
 so it's not too dark anymore.

549
00:21:03,900 --> 00:21:06,900
 But basically, his mum shot...

550
00:21:06,900 --> 00:21:08,900
 (LAUGHTER)

551
00:21:08,900 --> 00:21:11,100
 Will be the judge of how dark it is, Anna.

552
00:21:11,100 --> 00:21:14,540
 I think the people of Dublin might be the judge of this.

553
00:21:14,540 --> 00:21:16,300
 You're going to be traumatised.

554
00:21:16,300 --> 00:21:21,100
 Ty Cobb's mum shot his dad dead when...

555
00:21:21,100 --> 00:21:23,100
 (LAUGHTER)

556
00:21:23,100 --> 00:21:26,100
 It's OK. It was a long time ago.

557
00:21:26,100 --> 00:21:29,580
 Dublin's surprisingly up for their stories so far.

558
00:21:29,580 --> 00:21:36,100
 More than 100 years when the dad had suspected the mum of cheating on him,

559
00:21:36,100 --> 00:21:41,500
 and so he crept outside her bedroom window to catch her shagging another man.

560
00:21:41,500 --> 00:21:43,900
 But she thought that he was a burglar,

561
00:21:43,900 --> 00:21:47,580
 so she seized the gun that he'd given her as a present

562
00:21:47,580 --> 00:21:52,020
 to protect herself and shot him dead through the window,

563
00:21:52,020 --> 00:21:55,900
 bam, Ty Cobb's life slightly ruined.

564
00:21:55,900 --> 00:21:58,500
 But he did...

565
00:21:58,500 --> 00:22:00,620
 He did always credit his career success

566
00:22:00,620 --> 00:22:03,740
 to his dad watching over him and making him successful.

567
00:22:03,740 --> 00:22:07,300
 It's probably a good time to promote Anna's Netflix stand-up special,

568
00:22:07,300 --> 00:22:09,820
 which will be out very soon.

569
00:22:09,820 --> 00:22:12,260
 No, I'm calling it. That's funny.

570
00:22:12,260 --> 00:22:14,260
 The way...

571
00:22:14,260 --> 00:22:18,180
 Don't give someone a gun.

572
00:22:18,180 --> 00:22:23,140
 The way it's related is that Ty Warner also credited his dad with his career success

573
00:22:23,140 --> 00:22:28,940
 because he used the inheritance from his deceased father to found the company.

574
00:22:28,940 --> 00:22:30,940
 Wow.

575
00:22:30,940 --> 00:22:34,460
 That's why I told the dark gun story.

576
00:22:34,460 --> 00:22:36,460
 She's paying the big bucks.

577
00:22:36,460 --> 00:22:39,300
 Shall we go dark? Shall we keep going dark?

578
00:22:39,300 --> 00:22:43,580
 This is, according to the new book, so this is The Great Beanie Baby Bubble

579
00:22:43,580 --> 00:22:47,820
 by Zack Bissonette, which a lot of, at least the stuff that I've been reading has come from.

580
00:22:47,820 --> 00:22:51,900
 And he said that when Ty Warner saw the guy from Beanie Babies,

581
00:22:51,900 --> 00:22:56,380
 when his father died, he waited for five days to tell his sister

582
00:22:56,380 --> 00:22:59,860
 so that he could clear out his father's auntie's collection.

583
00:22:59,860 --> 00:23:01,860
 Oh, come on.

584
00:23:01,860 --> 00:23:04,140
 Wow. To take for himself?

585
00:23:04,140 --> 00:23:08,900
 Yeah. Yeah, his employees don't speak well about him.

586
00:23:08,900 --> 00:23:14,220
 I do, because he's still alive and I don't want a billionaire to sue us.

587
00:23:14,220 --> 00:23:16,220
 I think he's ace.

588
00:23:16,220 --> 00:23:21,100
 Although he was done for tax evasion, wasn't he?

589
00:23:21,100 --> 00:23:26,180
 Yeah, he was. He had 100 million dollars, which was in a secret Swiss bank account.

590
00:23:26,180 --> 00:23:30,340
 And every time he was asked on the tax forms, "Do you have money hidden overseas?"

591
00:23:30,340 --> 00:23:33,580
 he would tick the no option. And he did that for years and years and years.

592
00:23:33,580 --> 00:23:35,340
 He had a rookie era, basically.

593
00:23:35,340 --> 00:23:39,180
 The Wall Street Journal had said that he didn't really have very much money,

594
00:23:39,180 --> 00:23:40,420
 not as much money as he said.

595
00:23:40,420 --> 00:23:44,100
 And so he took out a full page advert in the Wall Street Journal saying,

596
00:23:44,100 --> 00:23:46,420
 "I've got fuckloads of money."

597
00:23:46,420 --> 00:23:51,300
 And the IRS went, "Oh, you do, do you?"

598
00:23:51,300 --> 00:23:56,260
 Just another story very quickly that I just love all these fights over Beanie Babies.

599
00:23:56,260 --> 00:23:59,060
 And there was a divorce that got taken to court.

600
00:23:59,060 --> 00:24:02,660
 And during the divorce proceedings, one of the sticking points,

601
00:24:02,660 --> 00:24:06,940
 which the judge got frustrated about, was the fact that the couple couldn't decide

602
00:24:06,940 --> 00:24:09,500
 how to split up their Beanie Baby collection.

603
00:24:09,500 --> 00:24:15,900
 And in the courtroom, the judge ordered them to actually split them up in the room

604
00:24:15,900 --> 00:24:22,300
 by pouring the Beanie Babies onto the floor and getting them to each pick one one at a time.

605
00:24:22,300 --> 00:24:24,380
 Oh, like you pick a football team?

606
00:24:24,380 --> 00:24:26,180
 Yes, exactly, like a football team.

607
00:24:26,180 --> 00:24:29,340
 And my favorite paragraph in the article is,

608
00:24:29,340 --> 00:24:31,980
 "I don't agree with the judge's decision to do this.

609
00:24:31,980 --> 00:24:35,460
 It's ridiculous and embarrassing," Francis Mountain said,

610
00:24:35,460 --> 00:24:39,540
 "moments before squatting on the courtroom floor alongside her ex-husband

611
00:24:39,540 --> 00:24:44,460
 to choose the first from a pile of stuffed toys."

612
00:24:44,460 --> 00:24:46,580
 We're going to have to move on, guys, to our next fact.

613
00:24:46,580 --> 00:24:47,860
 Yeah, we can. Yeah, should we do it?

614
00:24:47,860 --> 00:24:53,020
 Okay, it is time for fact number three, and that is my fact.

615
00:24:53,020 --> 00:24:58,500
 My fact this week is that due to the interests of its production coordinator,

616
00:24:58,500 --> 00:25:05,180
 Michigan State University's Planetarium not only dedicates itself to space science education,

617
00:25:05,180 --> 00:25:11,340
 but also houses the world's only moist towelette museum.

618
00:25:11,340 --> 00:25:17,100
 And this is it here, the moist towelette museum, showing a picture to the audience here.

619
00:25:17,100 --> 00:25:22,380
 It's basically what it is, is there's this big Planetarium at the Michigan State University

620
00:25:22,380 --> 00:25:26,060
 and their production coordinator, a guy called John French,

621
00:25:26,060 --> 00:25:30,700
 just opened the door to his office, put up a sign, and started displaying all the...

622
00:25:30,700 --> 00:25:32,780
 Yeah, I would say, Dan, can we explain this?

623
00:25:32,780 --> 00:25:36,860
 Like, maybe describe it to the people at home, because it doesn't really look like an office.

624
00:25:36,860 --> 00:25:39,100
 It just looks like a filing cabinet.

625
00:25:39,100 --> 00:25:44,940
 We're only seeing... So, on the left of the photo that we can see here is his computer and his desk.

626
00:25:44,940 --> 00:25:51,220
 And what he's done is he's set up two cabinets that should have probably relevant things to his job on it,

627
00:25:51,220 --> 00:25:54,860
 but he's emptied it and he's just covered it in moist towelettes.

628
00:25:54,860 --> 00:25:59,980
 And he had this idea when he was at the Planetarium in Texas,

629
00:25:59,980 --> 00:26:06,460
 and he took a cabinet that had the Mars rover on it, and he put his moist towelettes on it,

630
00:26:06,460 --> 00:26:11,420
 and he said, "I noticed that more people were looking at this cabinet when it had my moist towelettes on it

631
00:26:11,420 --> 00:26:14,940
 than when it had the Mars rover. Maybe I'm on to something."

632
00:26:14,940 --> 00:26:21,820
 And I guess no one had a choice in the matter, but he now runs the only museum that has it.

633
00:26:21,820 --> 00:26:27,180
 And it's fascinating, he's got a thousand of these things, and people all over the world send it to him.

634
00:26:27,180 --> 00:26:32,940
 And moist towelettes are incredible. The variety out there that we have of them is...

635
00:26:32,940 --> 00:26:34,140
 It's not that much, actually.

636
00:26:34,140 --> 00:26:39,980
 Oh, no! I mean, there's specific ones to wipe on your fingers for when they're blackened by a typewriter.

637
00:26:39,980 --> 00:26:46,300
 There are ones that you should use called "radiac wash" to wipe away when you're radioactively contaminated.

638
00:26:46,300 --> 00:26:47,660
 Wow!

639
00:26:47,660 --> 00:26:49,500
 What? I would hope.

640
00:26:49,500 --> 00:26:54,780
 If I'd been contaminated by radiation, I'd hope for a little more attention from the authorities

641
00:26:54,780 --> 00:26:58,780
 than a moist towelette.

642
00:26:58,780 --> 00:27:03,420
 That's very much the final thing we do after the big shower.

643
00:27:03,420 --> 00:27:07,900
 No, there was just an air stewadess walking through Chernobyl, okay?

644
00:27:07,900 --> 00:27:09,420
 A moist towel, anyone?

645
00:27:09,420 --> 00:27:14,380
 Dan, this is the most punishingly dull area of... I think we may ever have covered the moist...

646
00:27:14,380 --> 00:27:16,060
 What? This is incredible!

647
00:27:16,060 --> 00:27:21,180
 Well, I've been captured by it, too. Look, I found myself getting deep into moist towelette world

648
00:27:21,180 --> 00:27:24,300
 because there are interesting, very interesting elements to it.

649
00:27:24,300 --> 00:27:30,300
 For example, did you know that 6% of moist towelettes are used on cars?

650
00:27:30,300 --> 00:27:32,140
 Unbelievable.

651
00:27:32,140 --> 00:27:33,180
 You see?

652
00:27:33,180 --> 00:27:36,940
 But that's interesting. Wet wipes. 6% used on cars. You wouldn't have thought that, would you?

653
00:27:36,940 --> 00:27:38,620
 I wouldn't have thought that. I wouldn't have thought it.

654
00:27:38,620 --> 00:27:44,700
 No, like, guys, give it a chance. This is a fascinating thing.

655
00:27:44,700 --> 00:27:47,980
 French has been doing this, John French, for 20 years.

656
00:27:47,980 --> 00:27:52,860
 And he's even found the holy grail of moist towelettes, which he's...

657
00:27:52,860 --> 00:27:56,940
 The moist towelette that Christ used at the Last Supper.

658
00:27:56,940 --> 00:27:58,700
 The Turin towelette is...

659
00:27:58,700 --> 00:28:01,420
 I'm excited. It has his finger marks on it.

660
00:28:01,420 --> 00:28:04,940
 No, he found... So he's only got it...

661
00:28:04,940 --> 00:28:08,700
 John French has a website. I highly encourage you to check it out.

662
00:28:08,700 --> 00:28:13,420
 He can't reply to everyone who gets in contact with because he is inundated.

663
00:28:14,380 --> 00:28:15,980
 And there is an address.

664
00:28:15,980 --> 00:28:20,620
 And if you'd like to send your own moist towelette to him, do send it unused.

665
00:28:20,620 --> 00:28:23,500
 He does have one which is used.

666
00:28:23,500 --> 00:28:25,900
 It's a celebrity one to be fair.

667
00:28:25,900 --> 00:28:28,300
 So if you're a celebrity in the audience tonight, do use it first.

668
00:28:28,300 --> 00:28:29,820
 Who was it? Elvis or...

669
00:28:29,820 --> 00:28:30,700
 It was... No.

670
00:28:30,700 --> 00:28:32,140
 Do you mind if I take this one? Go for it.

671
00:28:32,140 --> 00:28:35,420
 It was donated by Tom and Ray Macliotsi.

672
00:28:35,420 --> 00:28:37,580
 So I don't need to tell you guys who they are.

673
00:28:37,580 --> 00:28:41,740
 But for any listeners at home, they host NPR's car talk show.

674
00:28:41,740 --> 00:28:46,860
 And the moist towelette they sent him was used to clean off some grease from a car once.

675
00:28:46,860 --> 00:28:48,860
 Oh, so one of the six per cent?

676
00:28:48,860 --> 00:28:49,740
 There we are.

677
00:28:49,740 --> 00:28:55,020
 So you can understand why he made an exception for that incredibly famous towelette.

678
00:28:55,020 --> 00:29:01,340
 But so on his website, he has what he says is the holy grail of moist towelettes.

679
00:29:01,340 --> 00:29:02,300
 They're just not sending it.

680
00:29:02,300 --> 00:29:04,700
 Damn, for fuck's sake, tell us what this is.

681
00:29:04,700 --> 00:29:07,900
 So it's a series of Star Trek moist towelettes

682
00:29:07,900 --> 00:29:10,460
 which have the image of Captain Kirk and Spock on it.

683
00:29:10,460 --> 00:29:12,700
 I've seen them. I've seen the photo on his website.

684
00:29:12,700 --> 00:29:15,020
 And yeah, they look impressive.

685
00:29:15,020 --> 00:29:18,060
 Well, they just have a photo on the towel.

686
00:29:18,060 --> 00:29:19,500
 No, it's not on the packaging.

687
00:29:19,500 --> 00:29:20,700
 It's on the packaging.

688
00:29:20,700 --> 00:29:22,300
 And we don't have that kind of technology.

689
00:29:22,300 --> 00:29:23,820
 You're going to put ink on it.

690
00:29:23,820 --> 00:29:24,940
 Come on, Anna, calm down.

691
00:29:24,940 --> 00:29:30,700
 Anyway, so I knew it was a good idea to do this fact tonight.

692
00:29:30,700 --> 00:29:31,580
 I can feel where...

693
00:29:31,580 --> 00:29:35,500
 Do you want to know something about the history of moist towelettes then?

694
00:29:35,500 --> 00:29:36,300
 Of course.

695
00:29:36,300 --> 00:29:37,100
 All together now?

696
00:29:37,580 --> 00:29:38,540
 Yes!

697
00:29:38,540 --> 00:29:41,420
 Great.

698
00:29:41,420 --> 00:29:42,300
 Someone said no.

699
00:29:42,300 --> 00:29:43,020
 Get out.

700
00:29:43,020 --> 00:29:45,900
 Out. Wrong room.

701
00:29:45,900 --> 00:29:47,740
 Yeah, you do not belong here.

702
00:29:47,740 --> 00:29:52,220
 Look, the reason they became the phenomenon they are today

703
00:29:52,220 --> 00:29:53,980
 and the reason we're all so excited by them

704
00:29:53,980 --> 00:29:57,740
 is because of a guy called Arthur Julius and the Colonel.

705
00:29:57,740 --> 00:30:01,340
 So Kentucky Fried Chicken brought us moist towelettes.

706
00:30:01,340 --> 00:30:04,460
 And this is in 1958 and he invented it.

707
00:30:04,460 --> 00:30:06,620
 And it was quite a big deal, right?

708
00:30:06,620 --> 00:30:11,340
 The idea that you can have something that stays damp for so long

709
00:30:11,340 --> 00:30:17,500
 and that doesn't disintegrate when you're cleaning stuff

710
00:30:17,500 --> 00:30:19,180
 is pretty amazing technology.

711
00:30:19,180 --> 00:30:20,220
 Absolutely, damn straight.

712
00:30:20,220 --> 00:30:24,380
 So he struck a deal with KFC.

713
00:30:24,380 --> 00:30:30,620
 Struck a deal with KFC to provide a free wet wipe with every KFC meal,

714
00:30:30,620 --> 00:30:32,380
 which works because they're finger-licking good,

715
00:30:32,380 --> 00:30:35,100
 but even licking your fingers sometimes isn't enough.

716
00:30:35,100 --> 00:30:37,180
 And that's where they took off.

717
00:30:37,180 --> 00:30:41,420
 It is quite amazing, that kind of how moist they keep.

718
00:30:41,420 --> 00:30:42,380
 It's extraordinary.

719
00:30:42,380 --> 00:30:43,420
 Do you have data?

720
00:30:43,420 --> 00:30:44,460
 They advertised it.

721
00:30:44,460 --> 00:30:47,500
 KFC advertised it as what your tongue doesn't get.

722
00:30:47,500 --> 00:30:48,540
 The wet wipe will.

723
00:30:48,540 --> 00:30:55,180
 Someone just commented, "That's my Tinder bio."

724
00:31:01,260 --> 00:31:07,340
 In the last 25 years, KFC has given away nearly a billion wet wipes.

725
00:31:07,340 --> 00:31:11,180
 And those wet wipes would reach halfway to the moon.

726
00:31:11,180 --> 00:31:13,580
 Overall, the amount of wet wipes of this company

727
00:31:13,580 --> 00:31:17,500
 nice and clean have made in America is 150 billion.

728
00:31:17,500 --> 00:31:21,340
 And that would go to the moon about 30 odd times, something like that.

729
00:31:21,340 --> 00:31:21,900
 Really?

730
00:31:21,900 --> 00:31:22,860
 So many.

731
00:31:22,860 --> 00:31:23,820
 Wow.

732
00:31:23,820 --> 00:31:25,660
 But the thing is about the moist towelettes

733
00:31:25,660 --> 00:31:27,180
 is they make so many of them

734
00:31:27,180 --> 00:31:29,900
 and basically people flush them down the toilet, don't they?

735
00:31:29,900 --> 00:31:32,540
 So by the way, the fact that you've been cheering them so far

736
00:31:32,540 --> 00:31:37,100
 is disgusting because they are basically the bad guys of the modern day.

737
00:31:37,100 --> 00:31:38,060
 They're very bad, aren't they?

738
00:31:38,060 --> 00:31:38,860
 Very bad.

739
00:31:38,860 --> 00:31:40,460
 They make fatbergs basically.

740
00:31:40,460 --> 00:31:44,380
 And the biggest fatberg in the UK quite recently found in Liverpool,

741
00:31:44,380 --> 00:31:49,340
 it weighed 400 tonnes and it was 250 metres long.

742
00:31:49,340 --> 00:31:49,980
 Wow.

743
00:31:49,980 --> 00:31:53,180
 And if you add that one to one that was found in Birmingham in the same year,

744
00:31:53,180 --> 00:31:55,820
 those two fatbergs alone would weigh more

745
00:31:55,820 --> 00:31:58,780
 than the giant statue of Christ in Rio de Janeiro.

746
00:31:58,780 --> 00:31:59,740
 Wow.

747
00:31:59,740 --> 00:32:01,980
 But no one has suggested a switch.

748
00:32:01,980 --> 00:32:09,100
 There was also a 2020 study in Ireland by Coastwatch

749
00:32:09,100 --> 00:32:14,700
 and they said that wet wipes are the main cause of microplastics in the sea.

750
00:32:14,700 --> 00:32:16,620
 You know, like these tiny little bits of plastic

751
00:32:16,620 --> 00:32:19,260
 and it's because little threads come off the wet wipes

752
00:32:19,260 --> 00:32:20,620
 and they end up in the sea.

753
00:32:20,620 --> 00:32:22,940
 And there's a teenager called Fionn Ferreira.

754
00:32:22,940 --> 00:32:26,460
 He's an Irish teenager and he's developed a technique

755
00:32:26,460 --> 00:32:29,180
 to remove this microplastics.

756
00:32:29,180 --> 00:32:31,820
 And this original fact was about planetariums.

757
00:32:31,820 --> 00:32:32,220
 Yeah.

758
00:32:32,220 --> 00:32:37,180
 And he also worked as a curator at Shull's Planetarium in County Cork.

759
00:32:37,180 --> 00:32:37,740
 No.

760
00:32:37,740 --> 00:32:39,180
 So it's another...

761
00:32:39,180 --> 00:32:39,820
 Yeah.

762
00:32:39,820 --> 00:32:40,380
 Wow.

763
00:32:40,380 --> 00:32:44,620
 So there's something about planetariums and wet wipes.

764
00:32:44,620 --> 00:32:46,220
 Were they just kind of drawn together?

765
00:32:46,220 --> 00:32:48,940
 Well, just one extra coincidence.

766
00:32:48,940 --> 00:32:50,940
 Yeah, there's a link.

767
00:32:50,940 --> 00:32:56,060
 The first ever use of the word wet wipe, phrase wet wipe, was in 1966

768
00:32:56,060 --> 00:32:57,900
 and it was from a NASA study.

769
00:32:57,900 --> 00:32:59,100
 This is really cool.

770
00:32:59,100 --> 00:33:01,020
 It was a study called Effective Diet and Atmosphere

771
00:33:01,020 --> 00:33:03,020
 on intestinal and skin flora.

772
00:33:03,020 --> 00:33:05,340
 So basically they were trying to work out

773
00:33:05,340 --> 00:33:07,020
 how's it that was sarcasm when I heard it.

774
00:33:07,020 --> 00:33:10,300
 It was a study.

775
00:33:10,300 --> 00:33:13,100
 It was a study trying to work out the influence of space flight,

776
00:33:13,100 --> 00:33:15,980
 what it would do to the microorganisms on your skin.

777
00:33:15,980 --> 00:33:19,100
 And they got, I think, 16 men and they studied them,

778
00:33:19,100 --> 00:33:20,940
 I think, in space-like conditions.

779
00:33:20,940 --> 00:33:22,860
 I don't think they actually sent them to space.

780
00:33:22,860 --> 00:33:25,820
 And they were kept in one environment for 42 days

781
00:33:25,820 --> 00:33:29,580
 and they were being kept without doing much washing

782
00:33:29,580 --> 00:33:32,540
 and their microorganisms on their skin were being studied.

783
00:33:32,540 --> 00:33:34,220
 Like areas including, I'm quoting here,

784
00:33:34,220 --> 00:33:39,180
 the ear, eyes, nails, umbilicus, anal fold, you name it.

785
00:33:39,180 --> 00:33:40,300
 The umbilicus.

786
00:33:40,300 --> 00:33:41,100
 Yeah, the belly button.

787
00:33:41,100 --> 00:33:41,660
 Belly button.

788
00:33:41,660 --> 00:33:42,300
 The belly button.

789
00:33:42,300 --> 00:33:43,980
 Yeah, we'll just go with the fucking belly button, guys.

790
00:33:43,980 --> 00:33:45,100
 Yeah, yeah.

791
00:33:45,100 --> 00:33:46,060
 I'm quite a NASA here.

792
00:33:46,060 --> 00:33:46,540
 Yeah.

793
00:33:46,540 --> 00:33:47,580
 But anyway.

794
00:33:47,580 --> 00:33:48,940
 But what's anal fold?

795
00:33:48,940 --> 00:33:50,780
 Oh, do you not have one?

796
00:33:50,780 --> 00:33:51,100
 We've all...

797
00:33:51,100 --> 00:33:51,740
 Ass crack.

798
00:33:51,740 --> 00:33:53,580
 Is that what it means?

799
00:33:53,580 --> 00:33:56,060
 I can't believe I'm having to do all this translation

800
00:33:56,060 --> 00:33:57,260
 from this side of the room.

801
00:33:57,260 --> 00:33:59,500
 Is that genuinely what NASA calls our butt crack?

802
00:33:59,500 --> 00:34:00,300
 Anal fold.

803
00:34:00,300 --> 00:34:00,860
 I'm afraid so.

804
00:34:00,860 --> 00:34:02,300
 Anal fold, yeah.

805
00:34:02,300 --> 00:34:05,100
 But, get this, the way they were allowed to clean themselves

806
00:34:05,100 --> 00:34:06,620
 in this study was as follows,

807
00:34:06,620 --> 00:34:08,620
 and this is where we get the phrase wet wipes from,

808
00:34:08,620 --> 00:34:12,300
 only wet wipes were allowed and were limited to three a day

809
00:34:12,300 --> 00:34:15,740
 for hand wiping following eating and defecation.

810
00:34:15,740 --> 00:34:19,660
 That was all the cleaning they were allowed to do.

811
00:34:19,660 --> 00:34:20,940
 Three wet wipes a day.

812
00:34:20,940 --> 00:34:22,940
 Would you poo once a day and eat twice a day?

813
00:34:23,820 --> 00:34:25,100
 Or vice versa?

814
00:34:25,100 --> 00:34:27,420
 I think the number of times you poo on a day

815
00:34:27,420 --> 00:34:28,700
 depends on how much you eat a day.

816
00:34:28,700 --> 00:34:29,420
 That's a good point.

817
00:34:29,420 --> 00:34:31,660
 Well, they're not allowed to correspond, James, so...

818
00:34:31,660 --> 00:34:35,100
 I would go for, like, three nil, but on alternate days.

819
00:34:35,100 --> 00:34:36,620
 Yeah, I love that.

820
00:34:36,620 --> 00:34:39,260
 Guys, we're going to have to move on very soon

821
00:34:39,260 --> 00:34:40,060
 to our next fact.

822
00:34:40,060 --> 00:34:41,660
 Our final fact.

823
00:34:41,660 --> 00:34:43,020
 Shall I quickly just tell you one thing

824
00:34:43,020 --> 00:34:44,060
 about planetarium?

825
00:34:44,060 --> 00:34:44,860
 It's our planetarium.

826
00:34:44,860 --> 00:34:45,420
 Yeah.

827
00:34:45,420 --> 00:34:47,020
 One of my favourite ones is in Moscow,

828
00:34:47,020 --> 00:34:47,980
 Moscow Planetarium.

829
00:34:47,980 --> 00:34:48,540
 I've been there.

830
00:34:48,540 --> 00:34:49,340
 It's really, really good.

831
00:34:49,340 --> 00:34:52,060
 They have a really, really massive dome,

832
00:34:52,060 --> 00:34:54,860
 and what is cool about it is the outer dome

833
00:34:54,860 --> 00:34:57,900
 is only eight centimetres thick at the top.

834
00:34:57,900 --> 00:34:59,900
 It goes down to 12 centimetres thick at the bottom.

835
00:34:59,900 --> 00:35:01,260
 It's really, really thin.

836
00:35:01,260 --> 00:35:03,020
 And that means that if you shrunk it down,

837
00:35:03,020 --> 00:35:05,180
 it would be thinner than an eggshell.

838
00:35:05,180 --> 00:35:05,980
 This is this planetarium.

839
00:35:05,980 --> 00:35:07,100
 If it was the size of an egg.

840
00:35:07,100 --> 00:35:08,060
 If it was the size of an egg.

841
00:35:08,060 --> 00:35:09,500
 That's amazing.

842
00:35:09,500 --> 00:35:12,300
 And the reason I bring it up is for you, Andy, really,

843
00:35:12,300 --> 00:35:14,780
 because it has a load of insulation in this.

844
00:35:14,780 --> 00:35:15,740
 And guess what it's made of?

845
00:35:15,740 --> 00:35:16,540
 Oh.

846
00:35:16,540 --> 00:35:17,260
 Is it moss?

847
00:35:17,260 --> 00:35:17,980
 It's moss.

848
00:35:17,980 --> 00:35:18,780
 Yes!

849
00:35:18,780 --> 00:35:24,060
 [APPLAUSE]

850
00:35:24,060 --> 00:35:27,340
 OK, it is time for our final fact of the show,

851
00:35:27,340 --> 00:35:29,500
 and that is Anna.

852
00:35:29,500 --> 00:35:32,540
 My fact this week is that 72 years

853
00:35:32,540 --> 00:35:35,100
 after the first Miss America contest,

854
00:35:35,100 --> 00:35:38,620
 the runner-up was still claiming I won it, hands down.

855
00:35:38,620 --> 00:35:42,460
 So this was 1921,

856
00:35:42,460 --> 00:35:44,780
 and at the time it was called the Intercity Beauty Contest.

857
00:35:44,780 --> 00:35:46,460
 It was an Atlantic City,

858
00:35:46,460 --> 00:35:48,780
 and the official winner,

859
00:35:48,780 --> 00:35:50,700
 according to the Miss America history,

860
00:35:50,700 --> 00:35:52,060
 it was a woman called a girl,

861
00:35:52,060 --> 00:35:54,220
 a 16-year-old girl called Margaret Gorman.

862
00:35:54,220 --> 00:35:57,340
 But there was also Miss Virginia Lee,

863
00:35:57,340 --> 00:35:59,660
 who was about 20, 21,

864
00:35:59,660 --> 00:36:02,780
 a bit too old almost for Miss America.

865
00:36:02,780 --> 00:36:06,060
 And so it was between Virginia and Margaret.

866
00:36:06,060 --> 00:36:08,780
 Everyone was saying they're the two best,

867
00:36:08,780 --> 00:36:10,140
 whatever you're supposed to be good at.

868
00:36:10,140 --> 00:36:14,540
 And then when the contest had ended,

869
00:36:14,540 --> 00:36:16,060
 before the results were announced,

870
00:36:16,060 --> 00:36:18,380
 and this is the first ever Miss America,

871
00:36:18,380 --> 00:36:20,060
 suddenly Virginia is disqualified.

872
00:36:20,060 --> 00:36:21,980
 And she was disqualified for being a professional.

873
00:36:21,980 --> 00:36:23,980
 It wasn't made clear before the contest

874
00:36:23,980 --> 00:36:26,300
 that it was amateurs only, but...

875
00:36:26,300 --> 00:36:27,900
 What is a professional in this context

876
00:36:27,900 --> 00:36:29,900
 where the criterion is just being fit?

877
00:36:29,900 --> 00:36:33,820
 Right, that's a huge misconception.

878
00:36:33,820 --> 00:36:37,980
 And B, I think everyone else had won local beauty contests

879
00:36:37,980 --> 00:36:40,460
 and then been upgraded to the National Beauty Contest,

880
00:36:40,460 --> 00:36:42,620
 whereas she just had a modelling contract for the magazine.

881
00:36:42,620 --> 00:36:44,620
 Yeah, she was a model, I think, is the point.

882
00:36:44,620 --> 00:36:47,500
 Yeah, and also one of the judges of the competition

883
00:36:47,500 --> 00:36:50,060
 ran the magazine that employed her as a model.

884
00:36:50,060 --> 00:36:51,660
 And perhaps that was all discovered.

885
00:36:51,660 --> 00:36:53,420
 And anyway, she was quite bitter about it.

886
00:36:53,420 --> 00:36:57,740
 And she always claimed that they told her even years afterward,

887
00:36:57,740 --> 00:36:58,940
 "Look, you won it really,

888
00:36:58,940 --> 00:37:00,540
 "but they said we can't give it to you,

889
00:37:00,540 --> 00:37:01,820
 "so this other woman won it."

890
00:37:01,820 --> 00:37:04,380
 So that's the controversial start to Miss America.

891
00:37:04,380 --> 00:37:07,980
 Yeah, it was quite an interesting event, wasn't it?

892
00:37:07,980 --> 00:37:13,100
 Because these women were brought on with King Neptune,

893
00:37:14,060 --> 00:37:16,940
 who was a one-handed inventor,

894
00:37:16,940 --> 00:37:19,740
 brother of friend of the podcast Hiram Maxim.

895
00:37:19,740 --> 00:37:22,940
 So Hiram Maxim, who invented the machine gun,

896
00:37:22,940 --> 00:37:26,540
 his brother was this guy, he was dressed as King Neptune.

897
00:37:26,540 --> 00:37:31,020
 He only had one hand because he'd lost it in a mercury explosion in 1894.

898
00:37:31,020 --> 00:37:35,900
 And he'd invented smokeless gunpowder.

899
00:37:35,900 --> 00:37:39,580
 Thomas Edison referred to him as the most versatile man in America.

900
00:37:39,580 --> 00:37:42,540
 It sounds pretty versatile if he's invented gunpowder

901
00:37:42,540 --> 00:37:45,980
 and simultaneously pretending to be King Neptune at a beauty contest.

902
00:37:45,980 --> 00:37:48,380
 That is the apex of the story.

903
00:37:48,380 --> 00:37:52,940
 But yeah, and it was basically in order to stop people going home

904
00:37:52,940 --> 00:37:56,140
 from Atlantic City because it was a big resort

905
00:37:56,140 --> 00:37:57,980
 and people would go home at the end of the summer,

906
00:37:57,980 --> 00:37:59,340
 but they wanted to keep people there.

907
00:37:59,340 --> 00:38:01,580
 So they had this extra thing to try and keep people there.

908
00:38:01,580 --> 00:38:03,820
 Yeah, it was all part of the Fall Frolick.

909
00:38:03,820 --> 00:38:04,780
 Yeah.

910
00:38:04,780 --> 00:38:07,980
 So it was a whole big festival where they had lots of other stuff on.

911
00:38:07,980 --> 00:38:10,540
 And actually, it was inspired by the Baby Parade,

912
00:38:10,540 --> 00:38:13,660
 which was really popular and had been since about 1900,

913
00:38:13,660 --> 00:38:18,540
 where you wheeled out your fit baby in a pram and people judged it.

914
00:38:18,540 --> 00:38:21,420
 And then I was looking up.

915
00:38:21,420 --> 00:38:22,540
 What would they do with it?

916
00:38:22,540 --> 00:38:23,580
 Was there a talent round?

917
00:38:23,580 --> 00:38:24,380
 Was there?

918
00:38:24,380 --> 00:38:27,100
 It was more like you looked at them and you put them in a nice bonnet

919
00:38:27,100 --> 00:38:28,620
 and you wheeled them around.

920
00:38:28,620 --> 00:38:32,620
 And actually, baby was a stretch because I read in one newspaper article

921
00:38:32,620 --> 00:38:37,340
 about 1928 that the baby parade, you had to be between six and 12 years old.

922
00:38:37,340 --> 00:38:40,460
 But then the following year, a three-year-old won it.

923
00:38:40,460 --> 00:38:41,420
 Wow.

924
00:38:41,420 --> 00:38:45,260
 You know, there are the sort of interview sections in the pageants.

925
00:38:45,260 --> 00:38:49,420
 You know, there was the swimsuit round until very, very recently in one of them.

926
00:38:49,420 --> 00:38:54,220
 And anyway, in 2011, here are samples of the Miss USA questions.

927
00:38:54,220 --> 00:38:58,620
 Which, just to be really clear, Miss USA is completely different to Miss America.

928
00:38:58,620 --> 00:38:59,820
 Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

929
00:38:59,820 --> 00:39:03,500
 Anyway, the questions in 2011 included asking whether evolution

930
00:39:03,500 --> 00:39:07,020
 should be taught in schools, which is frankly a poser.

931
00:39:07,020 --> 00:39:09,820
 I mean, you could spend hours talking about that in your answer.

932
00:39:09,820 --> 00:39:13,100
 And should the US Constitution protect the burning of religious books?

933
00:39:13,100 --> 00:39:14,940
 Oh my God.

934
00:39:14,940 --> 00:39:18,380
 To be fair, contestants were also asked if they could make the sounds of a cat,

935
00:39:18,380 --> 00:39:20,060
 a police siren and a slot machine.

936
00:39:20,060 --> 00:39:22,940
 A slot machine?

937
00:39:22,940 --> 00:39:25,980
 Amazing.

938
00:39:25,980 --> 00:39:28,860
 It's quite nice because when you read about the history of Miss America,

939
00:39:28,860 --> 00:39:31,820
 from the start, women have just been really skeptical about it.

940
00:39:31,820 --> 00:39:35,340
 And the biggest controversy was back in 1938.

941
00:39:35,980 --> 00:39:39,740
 Well, in fact, in 1938, Miss America contestants were banned.

942
00:39:39,740 --> 00:39:41,340
 The interview round was very hard then.

943
00:39:41,340 --> 00:39:43,340
 What do you think about the annexation of Austria?

944
00:39:43,340 --> 00:39:48,700
 Do you think Chamberlain might have actually been right to declare peace in our time,

945
00:39:48,700 --> 00:39:52,620
 given that that gave Britain vital time to rearm in the anticipation

946
00:39:52,620 --> 00:39:54,460
 of an inevitable war next year?

947
00:39:54,460 --> 00:39:57,180
 It was slightly too early for the Chamberlain question, but yeah.

948
00:39:57,180 --> 00:39:59,500
 Idiot.

949
00:40:03,420 --> 00:40:08,220
 No, in 1938, Miss America contestants were banned from spending time alone with a man

950
00:40:08,220 --> 00:40:10,780
 for the week before the pageant results were announced.

951
00:40:10,780 --> 00:40:15,180
 And that was because in 1937, and this is a huge deal, Miss America,

952
00:40:15,180 --> 00:40:18,380
 but the winner of Miss America, instead of being there for the ceremony

953
00:40:18,380 --> 00:40:21,820
 when the crown was placed on her head, was absent because she'd run off

954
00:40:21,820 --> 00:40:26,460
 with her chaperone for the week and the crown had to be placed on an empty chair.

955
00:40:26,460 --> 00:40:27,260
 Oh wow.

956
00:40:27,260 --> 00:40:29,180
 It's such a good story.

957
00:40:29,180 --> 00:40:31,020
 Just give it to someone else, wouldn't you?

958
00:40:31,020 --> 00:40:33,980
 Well, no, they had to stand by their principles, and their principles were that

959
00:40:33,980 --> 00:40:35,340
 Bette Cooper had won.

960
00:40:35,340 --> 00:40:36,220
 Wow.

961
00:40:36,220 --> 00:40:37,900
 And Bette Cooper didn't give a shit.

962
00:40:37,900 --> 00:40:44,540
 The only reason she'd entered was because her family kind of wanted a holiday in New Jersey,

963
00:40:44,540 --> 00:40:46,940
 and they were kind of against the contest, but they were like,

964
00:40:46,940 --> 00:40:48,780
 "Come on, our daughter's not going to win. Look at her."

965
00:40:48,780 --> 00:40:53,420
 And genuinely, they were like, "You'll never win, so it's fine."

966
00:40:53,420 --> 00:40:56,700
 And she did win, and they had a chaperone for the week,

967
00:40:56,700 --> 00:40:59,420
 like a driver to drive them around the event the week before the event.

968
00:40:59,420 --> 00:41:00,540
 And she liked him.

969
00:41:00,540 --> 00:41:01,580
 She started flirting with him.

970
00:41:01,580 --> 00:41:05,180
 He was called Louis Off, and she ran off with him.

971
00:41:05,180 --> 00:41:07,420
 Nice.

972
00:41:07,420 --> 00:41:12,300
 They did have, genuinely, it was in the contract, and this is Miss America,

973
00:41:12,300 --> 00:41:18,300
 where they would say that you had to pledge a vow to not having been either married or pregnant

974
00:41:18,300 --> 00:41:20,060
 in order to enter the competition.

975
00:41:20,060 --> 00:41:23,980
 Like, they were so stringent on the idea that you had to be this pure person.

976
00:41:23,980 --> 00:41:28,380
 And there were countless examples, again, just the fact that the women who did enter it

977
00:41:28,380 --> 00:41:29,900
 buckled the system when they won.

978
00:41:29,900 --> 00:41:34,620
 A lot of them just saying, "I'm not playing up to the thing that you're expecting of me."

979
00:41:34,620 --> 00:41:38,300
 But they did have all these clauses that you had to do as you were going in.

980
00:41:38,300 --> 00:41:39,180
 They still do.

981
00:41:39,180 --> 00:41:40,060
 Yeah, they still do.

982
00:41:40,060 --> 00:41:42,220
 I can't be married, but they...

983
00:41:42,220 --> 00:41:43,820
 Well, there is Mrs. World.

984
00:41:43,820 --> 00:41:44,620
 There is Mrs. World.

985
00:41:44,620 --> 00:41:46,140
 Genuinely, that really is a competition.

986
00:41:46,140 --> 00:41:48,620
 There is Mrs. World, which is for married women.

987
00:41:48,620 --> 00:41:51,900
 But they had a huge row last year, because at the prize giving,

988
00:41:51,900 --> 00:41:56,620
 one of the contestants punched the winner and ripped the crown off her head,

989
00:41:56,620 --> 00:41:58,620
 saying, "You're divorced."

990
00:41:58,620 --> 00:42:01,900
 And then... Like, genuinely, this happened.

991
00:42:01,900 --> 00:42:05,100
 And the winner said, "I'm separated. I'm not divorced."

992
00:42:05,100 --> 00:42:08,140
 And so... Wow.

993
00:42:08,140 --> 00:42:10,700
 Great Mrs. World, Canada, if the marriage was broken down that far.

994
00:42:10,700 --> 00:42:14,460
 If you are divorced, are you allowed to go back into the Miss America or...?

995
00:42:14,460 --> 00:42:18,940
 That's miss annulment, you're thinking of, which is completely different, yeah.

996
00:42:18,940 --> 00:42:22,540
 There was a controversy in Miss World in 2013.

997
00:42:22,540 --> 00:42:24,540
 This was Miss Uzbekistan.

998
00:42:24,540 --> 00:42:29,420
 The Uzbekistan officials said that she'd left a few things off her profile.

999
00:42:29,420 --> 00:42:33,260
 Namely, the fact that the country has never held a Miss Uzbekistan contest.

1000
00:42:33,260 --> 00:42:37,420
 And they had literally no idea who she was.

1001
00:42:37,420 --> 00:42:40,380
 She just rocked up and she went, "Yeah, I miss Uzbekistan."

1002
00:42:40,380 --> 00:42:41,180
 And they went, "All right."

1003
00:42:41,180 --> 00:42:42,380
 That's awesome.

1004
00:42:42,380 --> 00:42:43,980
 That's big brain time.

1005
00:42:43,980 --> 00:42:45,020
 That is. That's amazing.

1006
00:42:45,020 --> 00:42:47,820
 How did she do it? Did they keep her in or did she...?

1007
00:42:47,820 --> 00:42:50,300
 They kept her in. Yeah, she didn't do particularly well.

1008
00:42:50,300 --> 00:42:52,700
 But she, yeah, she stayed in the competition.

1009
00:42:52,700 --> 00:42:53,660
 That's so good.

1010
00:42:53,660 --> 00:42:58,940
 Uganda, for the Miss Uganda contest in 2014, you have to milk a cow.

1011
00:42:58,940 --> 00:43:02,860
 And this was when Museveni, President of Uganda,

1012
00:43:02,860 --> 00:43:06,700
 2014, sent the army in to run the Miss Uganda contest

1013
00:43:06,700 --> 00:43:09,500
 because he decided they weren't promoting the right kind of values.

1014
00:43:09,500 --> 00:43:11,580
 He was like, "He doesn't have the right priorities."

1015
00:43:11,580 --> 00:43:15,020
 But so their questions have all been quizzed on farming techniques.

1016
00:43:15,020 --> 00:43:18,780
 You know, which udder do you pull, which seed do you sow...?

1017
00:43:18,780 --> 00:43:20,380
 Which udder do you pull?

1018
00:43:20,380 --> 00:43:21,580
 Which udder do you pull?

1019
00:43:21,580 --> 00:43:22,300
 Pull the udder one.

1020
00:43:22,300 --> 00:43:25,260
 There we go.

1021
00:43:25,260 --> 00:43:31,020
 And Miss Navajo, you have to know how to butcher a sheep properly.

1022
00:43:31,020 --> 00:43:31,820
 Miss what?

1023
00:43:31,820 --> 00:43:34,620
 Navajo, like the Native American people.

1024
00:43:34,620 --> 00:43:37,980
 There's one question that once someone got in 2012.

1025
00:43:37,980 --> 00:43:40,940
 They were asked, "What are you supposed to do with a sheep's head?

1026
00:43:40,940 --> 00:43:41,980
 Any ideas?"

1027
00:43:41,980 --> 00:43:45,100
 Depends really what your interests are, I suppose.

1028
00:43:47,580 --> 00:43:51,500
 Is that the ventriloquism act that comes up later in the talent round?

1029
00:43:51,500 --> 00:43:54,380
 Let's say if you want to cook it.

1030
00:43:54,380 --> 00:43:55,180
 I'd curry it.

1031
00:43:55,180 --> 00:43:56,780
 Sheep's head, yeah?

1032
00:43:56,780 --> 00:43:59,100
 Yeah, you can't taste any of it in the end, can you?

1033
00:43:59,100 --> 00:44:02,460
 Yeah, not in the Navajo people because this is all about there.

1034
00:44:02,460 --> 00:44:06,460
 You have to know all about the Navajo customs from history.

1035
00:44:06,460 --> 00:44:08,460
 Julianne, chocolate julienne.

1036
00:44:08,460 --> 00:44:09,980
 No.

1037
00:44:09,980 --> 00:44:13,340
 You wrap it in aluminium foil and put it on the fire.

1038
00:44:13,340 --> 00:44:16,300
 Ah, can't be that old a tradition if it involves aluminium foil.

1039
00:44:17,260 --> 00:44:20,300
 And a couple of wet wipes and you're done.

1040
00:44:20,300 --> 00:44:24,140
 No, the person who answered that question,

1041
00:44:24,140 --> 00:44:27,500
 even though they kind of got it right because that is the modern way of doing it,

1042
00:44:27,500 --> 00:44:29,500
 they got booed because they answered in English

1043
00:44:29,500 --> 00:44:32,700
 and you were supposed to answer in Navajo, but they can't remember the words.

1044
00:44:32,700 --> 00:44:34,460
 Yeah, the Navajo for aluminium foil.

1045
00:44:34,460 --> 00:44:38,860
 I want to talk about the outrage of beauty contests

1046
00:44:38,860 --> 00:44:42,300
 leading to people feeling pressured to have plastic surgery,

1047
00:44:43,500 --> 00:44:45,340
 work done when they shouldn't.

1048
00:44:45,340 --> 00:44:47,820
 And the worst thing was this December just gone.

1049
00:44:47,820 --> 00:44:51,900
 It was a contest in Saudi Arabia and it was the camel beauty contest

1050
00:44:51,900 --> 00:44:55,740
 where 40 camels had to be disqualified

1051
00:44:55,740 --> 00:44:58,220
 because they'd had Botox and facelifts.

1052
00:44:58,220 --> 00:44:58,620
 Oh.

1053
00:44:58,620 --> 00:45:03,900
 Those humps look suspiciously pert to me.

1054
00:45:03,900 --> 00:45:08,780
 It's a real issue.

1055
00:45:08,780 --> 00:45:12,380
 There's $66 million worth of prize money up for grabs,

1056
00:45:12,380 --> 00:45:16,940
 but you are not allowed to enhance in any way the camel's heads,

1057
00:45:16,940 --> 00:45:22,220
 necks, humps, dress or posture and dozens of breeders did.

1058
00:45:22,220 --> 00:45:25,020
 How are they manipulating the camel's looks?

1059
00:45:25,020 --> 00:45:28,140
 They gave them Botox to inflate their body parts.

1060
00:45:28,140 --> 00:45:31,980
 They also had rubber bands that inflated their body parts

1061
00:45:31,980 --> 00:45:33,100
 in ways that I don't understand.

1062
00:45:33,100 --> 00:45:34,460
 To be honest, for this prize money,

1063
00:45:34,460 --> 00:45:37,260
 I'm willing to dress up as a camel and go to Saudi Arabia.

1064
00:45:37,260 --> 00:45:39,340
 Oh, well, I think you think a lot of yourself,

1065
00:45:39,340 --> 00:45:40,940
 if you think you dressed up as a camel,

1066
00:45:40,940 --> 00:45:43,340
 will be more attractive than an actual camel.

1067
00:45:43,340 --> 00:45:44,220
 I do.

1068
00:45:44,220 --> 00:45:46,860
 James, I back myself on this one.

1069
00:45:46,860 --> 00:45:49,980
 In a camel beauty contest where you're looking for something

1070
00:45:49,980 --> 00:45:53,420
 with two humps, a nice long face and Andy thinks,

1071
00:45:53,420 --> 00:45:55,900
 "Nah, I could just dress up as a camel and win it."

1072
00:45:55,900 --> 00:45:58,380
 I've got a nice long face and I think the humps,

1073
00:45:58,380 --> 00:45:59,580
 I'll sort something out.

1074
00:45:59,580 --> 00:46:03,020
 We've got to wrap up, guys.

1075
00:46:03,020 --> 00:46:03,660
 Okay.

1076
00:46:03,660 --> 00:46:06,780
 Yeah, James, do you want to lob one more thing in or are we?

1077
00:46:06,780 --> 00:46:07,660
 I can if you want.

1078
00:46:08,220 --> 00:46:12,220
 There is this thing in China where models will be given a job

1079
00:46:12,220 --> 00:46:13,740
 and they'll be saying, "Oh, come over here.

1080
00:46:13,740 --> 00:46:15,180
 It's like a modeling job."

1081
00:46:15,180 --> 00:46:18,620
 And then they're told to pretend to be like Miss America

1082
00:46:18,620 --> 00:46:20,380
 or Miss Brazil or whatever.

1083
00:46:20,380 --> 00:46:23,180
 And there was someone who was from Brazil,

1084
00:46:23,180 --> 00:46:24,940
 who was pretending to be Miss Chile.

1085
00:46:24,940 --> 00:46:28,860
 Someone from Ukraine who was pretending to be a Miss America.

1086
00:46:28,860 --> 00:46:30,300
 And the reason is that they take them

1087
00:46:30,300 --> 00:46:33,420
 to these like tiny little towns in the middle of nowhere

1088
00:46:33,420 --> 00:46:35,340
 and they say they're not going to know

1089
00:46:35,340 --> 00:46:37,420
 what Miss America is supposed to look like.

1090
00:46:37,420 --> 00:46:39,340
 So I'm just going to put a sash on you

1091
00:46:39,340 --> 00:46:41,900
 and we're going to pretend that we've managed to fly in

1092
00:46:41,900 --> 00:46:44,780
 all of these beauty contest winners from all around the world.

1093
00:46:44,780 --> 00:46:46,540
 It's like amazing.

1094
00:46:46,540 --> 00:46:47,180
 We're going to go.

1095
00:46:47,180 --> 00:46:50,540
 I'm going to sign the fittest camel in Saudi Arabia 2022.

1096
00:46:50,540 --> 00:46:56,140
 All right, look, we need to wrap up.

1097
00:46:56,140 --> 00:46:56,860
 That is it.

1098
00:46:56,860 --> 00:46:58,220
 That is all of our facts.

1099
00:46:58,220 --> 00:46:59,820
