00:00:02,00:00:18,"- Hello, and welcome to another episode"
00:00:18,00:00:20,"of No Such Thing as a Fish,"
00:00:20,00:00:25,a weekly podcast this week coming to you live from Dublin.
00:00:27,00:00:30,(crowd cheering)
00:00:30,00:00:34,My name is Dan Schreiber.
00:00:34,00:00:38,"I am sitting here with Anna Tyshinski,"
00:00:38,00:00:42,"Azure Hunts of Murray, and Jayne Markin."
00:00:42,00:00:46,"And once again, we have gathered around that microphone"
00:00:46,00:00:50,with our four favorite facts of the last seven days.
00:00:50,00:00:55,"And in that particular honor, here we go!"
00:00:55,00:00:58,(crowd cheering)
00:00:58,00:01:04,"Okay, calm the fuck down, everyone."
00:01:04,00:01:11,"Starting with fact number one, and that is James."
00:01:11,00:01:15,"Okay, my fact this week is that in 1954,"
00:01:15,00:01:18,it became illegal to bathe completely naked
00:01:18,00:01:19,in East Germany.
00:01:19,00:01:22,"So nature has started going to the beach,"
00:01:22,00:01:24,wearing nothing but a tie.
00:01:24,00:01:26,(crowd laughing)
00:01:26,00:01:33,"So just before World War II,"
00:01:33,00:01:34,"we've actually said this before,"
00:01:34,00:01:37,"Hitler banned natureism in the Nazi government,"
00:01:37,00:01:39,but almost immediately unbanded
00:01:39,00:01:41,because it was so unpopular.
00:01:41,00:01:45,And then it kind of became part of the Nazi tradition
00:01:45,00:01:48,that we're gonna allow people to be naked
00:01:48,00:01:51,if they want to be nudists if they want.
00:01:51,00:01:54,"And so when East Germany became a country,"
00:01:54,00:01:55,and they wanted to be away from the fascism
00:01:55,00:01:58,"with the communists, they saw natureism"
00:01:58,00:02:01,as like this fascist symbol from the past.
00:02:01,00:02:03,And so they decided to ban it.
00:02:03,00:02:05,And there's a whole load of stories
00:02:05,00:02:07,about what was happening with the natureists
00:02:07,00:02:09,who just wanted to get along with the get-off.
00:02:09,00:02:11,And the East German police really
00:02:11,00:02:13,were not happy about it at all.
00:02:13,00:02:15,- That's rough.
00:02:15,00:02:18,Nudity being taken down by fascism.
00:02:18,00:02:21,"Unless you've got a swastika tattooed onto your penis,"
00:02:21,00:02:23,then I don't think they're related.
00:02:23,00:02:25,"It's not budged, it's just they are."
00:02:25,00:02:27,"- Oh my God, I imagine that."
00:02:27,00:02:29,"'Cause really, by the time you see the swastika"
00:02:29,00:02:32,"on the penis, it's almost too late, isn't it?"
00:02:32,00:02:34,(laughing)
00:02:34,00:02:35,- Yeah.
00:02:35,00:02:37,- And one of the reasons why the East Germans
00:02:37,00:02:39,didn't like natureism is because of the main guy
00:02:39,00:02:42,who was in charge of German natureism.
00:02:42,00:02:45,"He was like the leading light of German natureism, really."
00:02:45,00:02:46,He was called Adolf Koch.
00:02:49,00:02:52,"Adolf Koch was an anti-drinking, anti-smoking,"
00:02:52,00:02:55,"pro-homosexuality, pro-sex outside marriage."
00:02:55,00:02:56,He was a pacifist.
00:02:56,00:02:59,He was very modern-day woke.
00:02:59,00:03:01,But obviously the communists
00:03:01,00:03:03,did not like him one little bit.
00:03:03,00:03:05,"And so he was almost like the face,"
00:03:05,00:03:07,"I hope the face, of natureism."
00:03:07,00:03:09,"And they really didn't like him,"
00:03:09,00:03:11,and that was one of the reasons they stamped down on it.
00:03:11,00:03:12,"- But they couldn't, right?"
00:03:12,00:03:16,"Because in the end, Germany is this strange anomaly"
00:03:16,00:03:19,"of country, which I think makes them kind"
00:03:19,00:03:21,"of the only sane country, in a way,"
00:03:21,00:03:23,"where they're all, not they're all,"
00:03:23,00:03:25,but more of them are much more comfortable
00:03:25,00:03:29,with natureism and nudity than any other countries.
00:03:29,00:03:31,And it's going down a little bit.
00:03:31,00:03:33,"But yeah, and it was started in Germany"
00:03:33,00:03:34,at the end of the 19th century.
00:03:34,00:03:38,"It was by this guy called Karl Diefenbach,"
00:03:38,00:03:41,"who moved himself and his entire family,"
00:03:41,00:03:42,"and I'd like to know what they thought of this,"
00:03:42,00:03:47,into an abandoned quarry where he lived with them naked.
00:03:47,00:03:50,"And he was taken to court,"
00:03:50,00:03:53,and then I think he was for being naked.
00:03:53,00:03:55,And then people agreed that it was okay.
00:03:55,00:03:57,"And the thing then was,"
00:03:57,00:03:59,"it was to emulate ancient Greek sculptures,"
00:03:59,00:04:02,which were considered so beautiful and shapely.
00:04:02,00:04:05,And so people would come to nudist parties
00:04:05,00:04:07,in the poses of Greek sculptures.
00:04:07,00:04:09,And then they'd sort of paint each other
00:04:09,00:04:10,and compliment each other.
00:04:10,00:04:12,And sounds lovely.
00:04:12,00:04:13,"- Yeah, right. - It is."
00:04:13,00:04:14,"- Wait, sorry, hang on."
00:04:14,00:04:18,Their costume was coming in the pose of a Greek later.
00:04:18,00:04:19,"- You know, like that discus thrower?"
00:04:19,00:04:20,You could have a discus.
00:04:20,00:04:22,"- Yeah, but you can't arrive at a party"
00:04:22,00:04:24,just holding a position.
00:04:24,00:04:26,(laughing)
00:04:26,00:04:27,- You have to be wheeled in.
00:04:27,00:04:28,"- Yeah, exactly."
00:04:28,00:04:29,(laughing)
00:04:29,00:04:32,"That's a lot of commitment to a party as well, I'd say."
00:04:32,00:04:35,You're naked and you're just not moving the entire party.
00:04:35,00:04:38,- Germany does have this thing of being quite passionate
00:04:38,00:04:40,"about the freikorpo cultio,"
00:04:40,00:04:42,which means free body culture.
00:04:42,00:04:43,And it's a really big thing there.
00:04:43,00:04:45,So there was a thing about 20 years ago
00:04:45,00:04:48,"on the, there was a resort on the island of RÃ¼gen."
00:04:48,00:04:50,And there was a bit of the beach
00:04:50,00:04:52,that was a nudist bit of the beach.
00:04:52,00:04:53,"And there was a bit,"
00:04:53,00:04:55,which was the non-nudist bit of the beach.
00:04:55,00:04:58,And the resort hired what they called
00:04:58,00:04:59,(speaking in foreign language)
00:04:59,00:05:01,or Panties Police.
00:05:01,00:05:06,"Who, their job was to ask people who were nudists"
00:05:06,00:05:08,who had strayed into the clothes section of the beach
00:05:08,00:05:11,to please go back to the nudist section of the beach.
00:05:11,00:05:13,But their other job was to approach clothes people
00:05:13,00:05:15,in the nudist section of the beach
00:05:15,00:05:17,"and say, get them off."
00:05:17,00:05:18,(laughing)
00:05:18,00:05:19,- Oh man.
00:05:19,00:05:21,Surely they'd say go back to the clothes section.
00:05:21,00:05:23,- I think they basically gave them a choice.
00:05:23,00:05:25,"They said, you can keep that or you can stay here,"
00:05:25,00:05:26,but you can't do both.
00:05:26,00:05:27,- That's amazing.
00:05:27,00:05:28,- Yeah.
00:05:28,00:05:29,"- Wasn't there a story,"
00:05:29,00:05:30,"I haven't written this down so I don't know the details,"
00:05:30,00:05:32,but wasn't there a story of someone robbing
00:05:32,00:05:34,either a shop or a bank?
00:05:34,00:05:36,"And as they ran out, they leapt over a fence"
00:05:36,00:05:38,"to try and integrate with the people around there,"
00:05:38,00:05:39,but it was a nudist camp.
00:05:39,00:05:40,(laughing)
00:05:40,00:05:43,"And the police came in, it spotted him immediately,"
00:05:43,00:05:44,only doing the clothes on.
00:05:44,00:05:46,"- In nudist resorts, the shoplifting"
00:05:46,00:05:47,is genuinely very low.
00:05:47,00:05:50,"As in, because where are you gonna put it?"
00:05:50,00:05:53,- You're only gonna hide things that are very thin.
00:05:53,00:05:54,- Absolutely.
00:05:54,00:05:55,(laughing)
00:05:55,00:05:57,"You can steal some cigarette papers,"
00:05:57,00:05:58,"but that's it, really."
00:05:58,00:06:00,- And no one's smoking those cigarettes.
00:06:00,00:06:03,(laughing)
00:06:03,00:06:06,"That's like Cape Dagde, which is a French holiday resort."
00:06:06,00:06:07,- Yeah.
00:06:07,00:06:10,"- Which I didn't know about, but it's a full on naked town."
00:06:10,00:06:13,"And in the summer, the population reaches 40,000,"
00:06:13,00:06:15,which I guess is just mostly visitors.
00:06:15,00:06:18,But it's quite odd because the visitors
00:06:18,00:06:20,"don't wear any clothes, so everyone's naked,"
00:06:20,00:06:22,but there are lots of shops and the post office
00:06:22,00:06:24,and banks and stuff like that.
00:06:24,00:06:26,And all the people who are serving them
00:06:26,00:06:28,in those places are fully clothed.
00:06:28,00:06:32,"So it's very surreal, like lots of naked customers,"
00:06:32,00:06:34,"and they're just in uniform bank teller,"
00:06:34,00:06:38,giving them their money that they can't keep anywhere.
00:06:38,00:06:42,"But yeah, there's very little crime,"
00:06:42,00:06:44,and they refer to the closed people
00:06:44,00:06:47,that you can see on the opposite bank as textiles.
00:06:47,00:06:49,(laughing)
00:06:49,00:06:51,- That plays Cape Dagde.
00:06:51,00:06:53,I think it's having a bit of an identity crisis
00:06:53,00:06:55,"at the moment, because it's turned into a very sexy place."
00:06:55,00:06:58,And swingers are starting to turn up.
00:06:58,00:07:01,"And the nudists are a bit put out about this,"
00:07:01,00:07:05,"because, A, naturism is not about sex or sexiness,"
00:07:05,00:07:09,it's about being natural and feeling your body in nature.
00:07:09,00:07:11,- I don't think it's a completely
00:07:11,00:07:14,"incomplete Venn diagram, though, is there?"
00:07:14,00:07:15,"- Well, yeah, this is the thing."
00:07:15,00:07:17,"So the naturists genuinely are saying we're not swingers,"
00:07:17,00:07:18,"and the swingers are turning up,"
00:07:18,00:07:19,but the other thing is that the swingers turn up
00:07:19,00:07:22,"and wear sexy clothes, and the naturists hate this."
00:07:22,00:07:24,"- Oh, really? - Yeah."
00:07:24,00:07:25,"- Yeah, so when we're saying most of the shops"
00:07:25,00:07:27,"that are weirded clothes shops,"
00:07:27,00:07:30,but they're selling kind of S&M fetish.
00:07:30,00:07:31,- Excellent chat. - That sort of stuff.
00:07:31,00:07:33,- Exactly. - Yeah.
00:07:33,00:07:36,"- Which absolutely is not what naturism is, really."
00:07:36,00:07:38,It's about kind of innocence and being freed
00:07:38,00:07:41,"from these constraints of, anyway,"
00:07:41,00:07:43,"you know, look, I've got a speech I'm giving afterwards."
00:07:43,00:07:46,(laughing)
00:07:46,00:07:47,- Can I ask a very stupid question?
00:07:47,00:07:49,"This is a genuinely stupid question,"
00:07:49,00:07:50,"but if you were a naturist,"
00:07:50,00:07:53,would seeing someone in clothes
00:07:53,00:07:57,be the equivalent of a sexy magazine?
00:07:57,00:08:01,- I think... - Is the opposite of what...
00:08:01,00:08:01,(laughing)
00:08:01,00:08:04,"- Is like their playboy just, I don't know."
00:08:04,00:08:06,"- They go to clubs, actually,"
00:08:06,00:08:08,and they watch people wearing heavy tweeds
00:08:08,00:08:09,dance around the pole.
00:08:09,00:08:12,(laughing)
00:08:12,00:08:13,- There was a bit of a moral panic
00:08:13,00:08:15,"back in the East German days,"
00:08:15,00:08:16,what I'm talking about now.
00:08:16,00:08:20,So there was a moral panic that people who were clothed
00:08:20,00:08:23,and were walking past the German naturists
00:08:23,00:08:25,were having their clothes stolen
00:08:25,00:08:27,and being thrown into the sea.
00:08:27,00:08:28,"And there were a few reports,"
00:08:28,00:08:30,"and we think it probably didn't happen,"
00:08:30,00:08:32,but they were just fake reports that it was happening.
00:08:32,00:08:33,"- Wait, clothed people?"
00:08:33,00:08:35,"- So you're a normal clothed person,"
00:08:35,00:08:37,just going about your business in Germany.
00:08:37,00:08:39,"Aye, aye, aye, aye, aye."
00:08:39,00:08:42,"And then suddenly a load of naked people come along,"
00:08:42,00:08:43,"they grab all of your clothes,"
00:08:43,00:08:44,"they rip them off and say,"
00:08:44,00:08:45,"""This is a naked place,"""
00:08:45,00:08:48,and then they throw you in the sea.
00:08:48,00:08:50,- Wow. - They throw you in the sea.
00:08:50,00:08:51,- Yeah.
00:08:51,00:08:52,"Genuinely, that was one of the reasons"
00:08:52,00:08:53,"why they tried to panic,"
00:08:53,00:08:55,"because this kind of moral panic came,"
00:08:55,00:08:57,"and it was in the newspapers that this was happening,"
00:08:57,00:08:58,"and everyone's like, ""Oh, my God,"
00:08:58,00:09:00,"""I'm just going to be walking down the streets in Berlin"
00:09:00,00:09:02,"""and people are going to rip my clothes off."
00:09:02,00:09:04,"""We need to stop these naturists now."""
00:09:04,00:09:05,- Good identity parades you'd have
00:09:05,00:09:07,"at the end of all that, wouldn't you?"
00:09:07,00:09:09,I recognise that swastika right there.
00:09:09,00:09:13,Can you ask him to do the salute?
00:09:13,00:09:18,"- Oh, my God."
00:09:18,00:09:22,- There was some small justification to being paranoid
00:09:22,00:09:25,about it being co-opted by well-perverts.
00:09:25,00:09:27,"So in the 1930s, when the movement started to take off,"
00:09:27,00:09:29,"there were fewer than 10,000 members"
00:09:29,00:09:32,"of the Natureism Society in the UK,"
00:09:32,00:09:36,"but the second issue of Sunbathing Review,"
00:09:36,00:09:39,"which was the euphemistic name for the nudist magazine,"
00:09:39,00:09:41,"sold 50,000 copies,"
00:09:41,00:09:42,and there was a small suspicion
00:09:42,00:09:44,that some of the people buying that
00:09:44,00:09:45,"were not actually nudists,"
00:09:45,00:09:47,"they just wanted to see loads of naked people,"
00:09:47,00:09:48,which makes sense.
00:09:48,00:09:50,And photographers for that magazine
00:09:50,00:09:52,"used to ship models to nudist beaches,"
00:09:52,00:09:54,"take photographs of them, and then leave."
00:09:54,00:09:56,"- But that was a big thing, wasn't it?"
00:09:56,00:09:57,"So around the world now,"
00:09:57,00:10:00,"the article that I read, there may be more now,"
00:10:00,00:10:04,but there's four nudist libraries in the world today.
00:10:04,00:10:04,- Really?
00:10:04,00:10:07,"- So a nudist library, it's a combination of two things."
00:10:07,00:10:09,"One is, it's a library about nudity."
00:10:09,00:10:12,"So it's just got magazines, it's got books,"
00:10:12,00:10:14,anything that is about nudity.
00:10:14,00:10:16,So the magazines that they have are not Playboy
00:10:16,00:10:17,"or anything to do with sexuality,"
00:10:17,00:10:19,"but in the '60s and '70s,"
00:10:19,00:10:21,there was a boom when a law got taken down
00:10:21,00:10:24,"to say that nakedness could be represented in magazines,"
00:10:24,00:10:27,"and a lot of magazines with nudity were printed,"
00:10:27,00:10:30,"and so this is a library that has all of that,"
00:10:30,00:10:33,but you are allowed to be naked in it as well.
00:10:33,00:10:36,"It's a nudist, nudist library."
00:10:36,00:10:38,- Here's one thing that happens to nudists.
00:10:38,00:10:39,"This is according to Stefan Duchenne,"
00:10:39,00:10:41,who is the new co-president
00:10:41,00:10:44,of the International Nudism Federation.
00:10:44,00:10:45,"He was interviewed recently about nudism,"
00:10:45,00:10:47,and he said that one thing you can get
00:10:47,00:10:52,"if you're a nudist is you get phantom clothes, okay?"
00:10:52,00:10:54,He said after decades of...
00:10:54,00:10:55,This is the article.
00:10:55,00:10:57,"After decades of living as a naturist,"
00:10:57,00:10:59,Duchenne still sometimes reaches to pull up
00:10:59,00:11:02,his non-existent pants after using the restroom.
00:11:02,00:11:05,"- How was that? - Yeah, I see it."
00:11:05,00:11:07,"I see that, that makes sense."
00:11:07,00:11:08,- Yeah. - Yeah.
00:11:08,00:11:10,"- Do you know, so when I was looking at this fact,"
00:11:10,00:11:13,"I literally, I think I typed in something as simple"
00:11:13,00:11:17,"into Google to kick off as naturism history,"
00:11:17,00:11:21,"and one of the first results was naturist cleaners,"
00:11:21,00:11:26,which is the UK's leading naturist nude cleaning service.
00:11:26,00:11:27,"I cannot believe this exists,"
00:11:27,00:11:30,"so naked people come to clean your house,"
00:11:30,00:11:32,and it's a professional cleaning service.
00:11:32,00:11:35,"- I mean, I feel like I would have to hire another cleaner"
00:11:35,00:11:37,for whatever they'd start.
00:11:37,00:11:42,"It's like, oh my God, no, no, no, don't sit there, don't sit there."
00:11:42,00:11:44,"- They don't arrive at your door naked, though."
00:11:44,00:11:45,- That's a really good question.
00:11:45,00:11:46,"I don't know if they do,"
00:11:46,00:11:48,"because you're not, that's illegal, isn't it?"
00:11:48,00:11:50,So they must arrive in maybe a trench.
00:11:50,00:11:51,"- It's not illegal, it's not illegal."
00:11:51,00:11:51,- It's not illegal. - It's not illegal.
00:11:51,00:11:54,"- It is actually, it is here in Ireland."
00:11:54,00:11:55,- Is it? - In Nuttas.
00:11:55,00:11:59,"- Yeah, Ireland hosted the 2014 34th"
00:11:59,00:12:00,"International Naturist Congress,"
00:12:00,00:12:03,despite it being technically banned by law.
00:12:03,00:12:04,- Yeah. - You've proved.
00:12:04,00:12:07,"- You have a series, a selection of secret coves"
00:12:07,00:12:11,"that Irish nudists go to, and it's all done..."
00:12:11,00:12:13,- See you all after the show.
00:12:13,00:12:14,- Yeah.
00:12:14,00:12:16,"- So is it, Andy, is it, if we were back in London,"
00:12:16,00:12:18,is it legal for us to just walk around?
00:12:18,00:12:20,- It's legal. - According to the website
00:12:20,00:12:23,"of the Great British Take-Off from last year,"
00:12:23,00:12:28,"they are very, very clear on the front page."
00:12:28,00:12:30,"By the way, it's perfectly legal."
00:12:30,00:12:33,"They said, ""By all means, tell the neighbours,"
00:12:33,00:12:36,"""but there is no need to warn them, even if you're overlooked."
00:12:36,00:12:38,"""So long as you are not revealing yourself"
00:12:38,00:12:41,"""with the intention of upsetting people, it's fine."""
00:12:41,00:12:44,"- Yeah, I was intending to delight people."
00:12:45,00:12:47,"- Yeah, it's that, it's a great idea."
00:12:47,00:12:49,"- By the way, the Great British Take-Off, last year's,"
00:12:49,00:12:51,they gave you some ideas of what you could do.
00:12:51,00:12:54,"They're basically saying, ""Take your clothes off in your garden."""
00:12:54,00:12:56,"They say, ""You could sunbathe, read, sit in a hot tub,"
00:12:56,00:12:58,"""you can have a barbecue,"
00:12:58,00:13:01,"""you can kick a ball around through a frisbee."""
00:13:01,00:13:03,- Do we kick the other ball around?
00:13:03,00:13:08,"- ""Do a jigsaw puzzle or listen to a podcast."""
00:13:08,00:13:10,- Oh. - Oh.
00:13:10,00:13:12,- So if anyone's listening to this one in the net...
00:13:13,00:13:17,- Hi to you. - Take a photo right now and send it to us.
00:13:17,00:13:19,Right now. Do it.
00:13:19,00:13:23,"- You can do that on the street, in a shop or whatever."
00:13:23,00:13:26,"'Cause in your garden, obviously, I can do anything in my garden."
00:13:26,00:13:28,"- In theory, it's legal."
00:13:28,00:13:31,- Tesco can't kick me out if I go there.
00:13:31,00:13:33,- Tesco's a private company. - I have a property there.
00:13:33,00:13:35,- I think the police would take an interest
00:13:35,00:13:37,if you'd just walk around the centre of town.
00:13:37,00:13:39,"- Okay, but a hospital, not private,"
00:13:39,00:13:41,"NHS, publicly funded,"
00:13:41,00:13:44,"if I walk into a hospital but naked for no good reason,"
00:13:44,00:13:46,they can't do anything about it.
00:13:46,00:13:47,- I think you'd have to wear a mask.
00:13:47,00:13:49,- Yeah.
00:13:49,00:13:57,"- All right, look, we need to move on to our next fact."
00:13:57,00:14:01,"It is time for fact number two, and that is..."
00:14:01,00:14:04,"- Andy. - My fact is that in 1998,"
00:14:04,00:14:08,one-tenth of everything sold on eBay was a beanie baby.
00:14:10,00:14:12,"- One-tenth, 10%... - Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa."
00:14:12,00:14:14,"So if I bought a handbag,"
00:14:14,00:14:16,one-tenth of it would be a beanie baby.
00:14:16,00:14:17,- That's right.
00:14:17,00:14:18,"It would almost all be handbag,"
00:14:18,00:14:22,but the strap and one of the pockets would be beamed.
00:14:22,00:14:24,"This is a fact about beanie babies,"
00:14:24,00:14:27,"which, for a while, everyone was insane about."
00:14:27,00:14:30,"But any younger listeners who missed out on the beanie baby craze,"
00:14:30,00:14:33,they're just little stuffed bears full of plastic pellets.
00:14:33,00:14:35,"That's it. - But that was the difference,"
00:14:35,00:14:38,"'cause every bear, prior to that, or any stuffed animal,"
00:14:38,00:14:41,"was completely stuffed to the hilt, and there was no bend."
00:14:41,00:14:44,But these little beans meant you could move it and you could do things.
00:14:44,00:14:46,"- Yeah. - It was almost like it was alive, wasn't it,"
00:14:46,00:14:48,'cause it could move around in different ways.
00:14:48,00:14:51,- Exactly. - It wasn't like it was alive.
00:14:51,00:14:52,It was just floppy.
00:14:52,00:14:54,It was a floppy teddy.
00:14:54,00:14:56,"And to be fair, I hadn't actually realised,"
00:14:56,00:14:59,"until researching this fact, that that was the innovation."
00:14:59,00:15:01,"You know, 'cause you grow up with beanie babies,"
00:15:01,00:15:02,"you think, ""It's always been like this."
00:15:02,00:15:05,"""Was there ever a time before this kind of vibe?"""
00:15:05,00:15:06,"But, yeah, before that,"
00:15:06,00:15:08,teddy bears were just like...
00:15:08,00:15:10,"- ""Buff!"" - In fairness."
00:15:10,00:15:13,"- Constipated. - It's Iwana who invented them, right?"
00:15:13,00:15:14,He was the guy who invented them.
00:15:14,00:15:18,He did say the whole idea was it looked real because it moved.
00:15:18,00:15:21,He thought these looked like actual bears.
00:15:21,00:15:22,- Yeah. - Mmm.
00:15:22,00:15:24,"- So, in 1998,"
00:15:24,00:15:28,64% of American adults owned at least one beanie baby.
00:15:28,00:15:31,"- That is ridiculous. I saw that, and I didn't believe it."
00:15:31,00:15:35,"In 1997, 64%, like you say, owned a beanie baby,"
00:15:35,00:15:40,but 48% of Americans in 1997 believed in global warming.
00:15:40,00:15:43,"- Uh-huh. - 53% trusted the media,"
00:15:43,00:15:47,and 15% had a passport.
00:15:47,00:15:50,That's compared with 64% who had a beanie baby.
00:15:50,00:15:51,"- Well, why... - Wow."
00:15:51,00:15:52,- You don't need to leave the country
00:15:52,00:15:55,when you've got these lovely beanie babies to identify you.
00:15:55,00:15:57,"They started off, so, Tai Wano, who James just mentioned,"
00:15:57,00:15:59,"he was the man behind them,"
00:15:59,00:16:02,"and he had limited success with them, really."
00:16:02,00:16:04,"He released a few, and they were doing all right."
00:16:04,00:16:08,"And then, in 1995, two years after they launched,"
00:16:08,00:16:09,he discontinued one of them.
00:16:09,00:16:11,There were problems with the factory
00:16:11,00:16:13,"where they were being made overseas,"
00:16:13,00:16:15,"so he thought, ""Right, sod it. We'll just kill off Lovey the Lamb."""
00:16:15,00:16:18,"And suddenly, people were desperate for Lovey the Lamb,"
00:16:18,00:16:19,"and he realised, ""Oh, we're not going to say"
00:16:19,00:16:20,"""there are problems with the supplier."
00:16:20,00:16:21,"""We can't get any of these."""
00:16:21,00:16:24,- And we also won't say we killed it off.
00:16:24,00:16:26,- That's true. - It's true.
00:16:26,00:16:27,"Well, yes, you're right."
00:16:27,00:16:29,"He said, specifically, it's been retired,"
00:16:29,00:16:32,"so that suddenly created this huge demand for Lovey the Lamb,"
00:16:32,00:16:34,and that became the entire business model behind the beanie baby.
00:16:34,00:16:37,There were hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of different models
00:16:37,00:16:39,"by the end, which were being brought in, phased out."
00:16:39,00:16:42,It was incredibly hard to keep track of where they all were
00:16:42,00:16:44,and to have a full set.
00:16:44,00:16:46,"But it's almost weirdly responsible, as well,"
00:16:46,00:16:48,"for the fact that we have eBay now,"
00:16:48,00:16:50,"as in we had eBay at the time,"
00:16:50,00:16:53,"but in 1998, eBay had 30 employees."
00:16:53,00:16:55,"There were half a million users on it,"
00:16:55,00:16:59,so the 10% of it was 10% of half a million users.
00:16:59,00:17:00,- What is that? - What is what?
00:17:00,00:17:02,10% of half a million.
00:17:02,00:17:03,(LAUGHTER)
00:17:03,00:17:05,That's not what you came for.
00:17:05,00:17:07,"You didn't come for a maths test, Dan."
00:17:07,00:17:09,"- Good point. - Go on, I apologise."
00:17:09,00:17:11,(LAUGHTER)
00:17:11,00:17:12,It's like your worst nightmare.
00:17:12,00:17:14,Someone give you a percentage question on stage
00:17:14,00:17:15,of one in 500 people.
00:17:15,00:17:16,"Even though it's really easy,"
00:17:16,00:17:17,"because there's so many people here,"
00:17:17,00:17:19,I can't work out what it is in my head.
00:17:19,00:17:21,(LAUGHTER)
00:17:21,00:17:23,It's a nightmare.
00:17:23,00:17:25,"Well, you're not the CEO of eBay."
00:17:25,00:17:27,- You don't need to know these numbers. - Exactly.
00:17:27,00:17:29,"Anna, you are one sick puffy."
00:17:29,00:17:31,(LAUGHTER)
00:17:31,00:17:32,"It's 50,000."
00:17:32,00:17:34,"- OK, let's move on. - Of course it's 50,000."
00:17:34,00:17:36,We all knew that.
00:17:36,00:17:37,(LAUGHTER)
00:17:37,00:17:39,But so... Thank you.
00:17:39,00:17:41,(LAUGHTER)
00:17:41,00:17:43,"When eBay went public, here was the thing."
00:17:43,00:17:47,"They were so desperately clinging on to this fad,"
00:17:47,00:17:49,"helping them, because that was bringing in such a huge bit of revenue"
00:17:49,00:17:53,"that even in the risk factors section of their annual report,"
00:17:53,00:17:56,it was noted their absolute dependence
00:17:56,00:17:58,on the continued strength of the beanie baby.
00:17:58,00:18:00,"- Wow. - They were like, ""This has to keep going."""
00:18:00,00:18:04,"And it did, and everyone, Ty Warner and the owners of eBay,"
00:18:04,00:18:05,all became billionaires.
00:18:05,00:18:08,Ty Warner's genius was in marketing.
00:18:08,00:18:11,"Obviously, this false scarcity bullshit,"
00:18:11,00:18:13,"which, by the way, we're all falling for again"
00:18:13,00:18:16,with that weird word game that everyone's obsessed with.
00:18:16,00:18:17,Aren't we now?
00:18:17,00:18:18,So...
00:18:18,00:18:21,"Oh, one a day, suddenly I really wanted."
00:18:21,00:18:22,(LAUGHTER)
00:18:22,00:18:24,You know what I'm talking about.
00:18:24,00:18:27,So he had some other weird marketing tricks.
00:18:27,00:18:30,"Ty, he wouldn't sell beanie babies to big stores"
00:18:30,00:18:31,like Toys R Us or Walmart.
00:18:31,00:18:34,He would only sell them to kind of small shops.
00:18:34,00:18:36,And he made the stores that he sold them to promise
00:18:36,00:18:39,not to sell more than a few to a single customer.
00:18:39,00:18:41,"So, you know, you reached a limit."
00:18:41,00:18:44,"And, you know, he'd monitor the stores really obsessively"
00:18:44,00:18:45,"and they'd be under strict instructions,"
00:18:45,00:18:47,"so, like, not discount any."
00:18:47,00:18:49,"If you discounted a beanie baby,"
00:18:49,00:18:51,you got all your supplies whipped away from you.
00:18:51,00:18:53,"It sounds kind of terrifying,"
00:18:53,00:18:55,and shop owners would call him and beg for stock.
00:18:55,00:18:58,And the only time he'd give them what they wanted
00:18:58,00:19:00,is if they had a private chat with him
00:19:00,00:19:02,about what customers were responding to
00:19:02,00:19:04,and what they were liking about certain ones.
00:19:04,00:19:06,"Wow. It was, like, gangster."
00:19:06,00:19:07,"It's very... It is a bit mafioso, yeah."
00:19:07,00:19:09,Yeah. There was a... There was a scheme.
00:19:09,00:19:10,Allegedly.
00:19:10,00:19:12,(LAUGHTER)
00:19:12,00:19:13,I think he was in the mob.
00:19:13,00:19:14,Um...
00:19:14,00:19:15,(LAUGHTER)
00:19:15,00:19:16,Anyway...
00:19:16,00:19:17,Um...
00:19:17,00:19:19,There was a thing in Illinois in 1998
00:19:19,00:19:20,"where there was a police force,"
00:19:20,00:19:23,"a small police force in a place called Kankakee, Illinois, right?"
00:19:23,00:19:26,"They said that if you have an illegal gun,"
00:19:26,00:19:28,"but you hand it into us,"
00:19:28,00:19:30,you will get a free teeny beanie baby.
00:19:30,00:19:31,(LAUGHTER)
00:19:31,00:19:32,No way!
00:19:32,00:19:34,There was a special small beanie baby that had been made.
00:19:34,00:19:36,They got 40 people handing in guns
00:19:36,00:19:37,(LAUGHTER)
00:19:37,00:19:38,on the center of Beanie Baby.
00:19:38,00:19:39,But they were huge!
00:19:39,00:19:42,"Like, yeah, the resale value of the teeny..."
00:19:42,00:19:45,or any of the beanie babies was massive.
00:19:45,00:19:46,And there was...
00:19:46,00:19:48,"OK, yes, he went with the independent stores to begin with,"
00:19:48,00:19:51,but one big decisive moment for the company
00:19:51,00:19:53,was when he paired up with McDonald's for the Happy Meal.
00:19:53,00:19:55,"And so he did the Happy Meal,"
00:19:55,00:19:57,"and they were teeny beanie babies,"
00:19:57,00:19:59,"and they did 100 million of them,"
00:19:59,00:20:00,and they just went so quick.
00:20:00,00:20:02,And it caused chaos for McDonald's.
00:20:02,00:20:06,McDonald's were saying that people were ordering 100 Happy Meals
00:20:06,00:20:09,"and saying, ""Keep the food. We just need the babies."""
00:20:09,00:20:10,(LAUGHTER)
00:20:10,00:20:12,They did television adverts
00:20:12,00:20:15,over the worry that massive crowds were coming
00:20:15,00:20:17,and the safety of the employees were in jeopardy.
00:20:17,00:20:19,"They were like, ""Please, stop."""
00:20:19,00:20:22,"It got to the point where people were calling up to order things,"
00:20:22,00:20:24,"and the people were answering the phone by saying,"
00:20:24,00:20:27,"""Good morning, McDonald's. We have the moose and the lamb."""
00:20:27,00:20:28,(LAUGHTER)
00:20:28,00:20:31,"But then, surely, you want either the beef or the chicken, usually."
00:20:31,00:20:32,(LAUGHTER)
00:20:32,00:20:34,It's going to be confusing.
00:20:34,00:20:39,"I have a tangentially-related gun fact, since Andy mentioned guns."
00:20:39,00:20:40,"Yeah, cool."
00:20:40,00:20:43,"Ty Warner was called H. Ty Warner, right?"
00:20:43,00:20:45,"That was his full name, and the H in his name,"
00:20:45,00:20:48,"he said, just didn't stand for anything."
00:20:48,00:20:52,"But the reason he was called Ty was because he was named after Ty Cobb,"
00:20:52,00:20:54,who was a famous baseball player.
00:20:54,00:20:57,"So then, I just got distracted reading about Ty Cobb."
00:20:57,00:20:58,But I found some weird similarities.
00:20:58,00:21:00,Ty Cobb's story is amazing.
00:21:00,00:21:02,"He was a baseball player at the turn of the 20th century,"
00:21:02,00:21:03,so it's not too dark anymore.
00:21:03,00:21:06,"But basically, his mum shot..."
00:21:06,00:21:08,(LAUGHTER)
00:21:08,00:21:11,"Will be the judge of how dark it is, Anna."
00:21:11,00:21:14,I think the people of Dublin might be the judge of this.
00:21:14,00:21:16,You're going to be traumatised.
00:21:16,00:21:21,Ty Cobb's mum shot his dad dead when...
00:21:21,00:21:23,(LAUGHTER)
00:21:23,00:21:26,It's OK. It was a long time ago.
00:21:26,00:21:29,Dublin's surprisingly up for their stories so far.
00:21:29,00:21:36,"More than 100 years when the dad had suspected the mum of cheating on him,"
00:21:36,00:21:41,and so he crept outside her bedroom window to catch her shagging another man.
00:21:41,00:21:43,"But she thought that he was a burglar,"
00:21:43,00:21:47,so she seized the gun that he'd given her as a present
00:21:47,00:21:52,"to protect herself and shot him dead through the window,"
00:21:52,00:21:55,"bam, Ty Cobb's life slightly ruined."
00:21:55,00:21:58,But he did...
00:21:58,00:22:00,He did always credit his career success
00:22:00,00:22:03,to his dad watching over him and making him successful.
00:22:03,00:22:07,"It's probably a good time to promote Anna's Netflix stand-up special,"
00:22:07,00:22:09,which will be out very soon.
00:22:09,00:22:12,"No, I'm calling it. That's funny."
00:22:12,00:22:14,The way...
00:22:14,00:22:18,Don't give someone a gun.
00:22:18,00:22:23,The way it's related is that Ty Warner also credited his dad with his career success
00:22:23,00:22:28,because he used the inheritance from his deceased father to found the company.
00:22:28,00:22:30,Wow.
00:22:30,00:22:34,That's why I told the dark gun story.
00:22:34,00:22:36,She's paying the big bucks.
00:22:36,00:22:39,Shall we go dark? Shall we keep going dark?
00:22:39,00:22:43,"This is, according to the new book, so this is The Great Beanie Baby Bubble"
00:22:43,00:22:47,"by Zack Bissonette, which a lot of, at least the stuff that I've been reading has come from."
00:22:47,00:22:51,"And he said that when Ty Warner saw the guy from Beanie Babies,"
00:22:51,00:22:56,"when his father died, he waited for five days to tell his sister"
00:22:56,00:22:59,so that he could clear out his father's auntie's collection.
00:22:59,00:23:01,"Oh, come on."
00:23:01,00:23:04,Wow. To take for himself?
00:23:04,00:23:08,"Yeah. Yeah, his employees don't speak well about him."
00:23:08,00:23:14,"I do, because he's still alive and I don't want a billionaire to sue us."
00:23:14,00:23:16,I think he's ace.
00:23:16,00:23:21,"Although he was done for tax evasion, wasn't he?"
00:23:21,00:23:26,"Yeah, he was. He had 100 million dollars, which was in a secret Swiss bank account."
00:23:26,00:23:30,"And every time he was asked on the tax forms, ""Do you have money hidden overseas?"""
00:23:30,00:23:33,he would tick the no option. And he did that for years and years and years.
00:23:33,00:23:35,"He had a rookie era, basically."
00:23:35,00:23:39,"The Wall Street Journal had said that he didn't really have very much money,"
00:23:39,00:23:40,not as much money as he said.
00:23:40,00:23:44,"And so he took out a full page advert in the Wall Street Journal saying,"
00:23:44,00:23:46,"""I've got fuckloads of money."""
00:23:46,00:23:51,"And the IRS went, ""Oh, you do, do you?"""
00:23:51,00:23:56,Just another story very quickly that I just love all these fights over Beanie Babies.
00:23:56,00:23:59,And there was a divorce that got taken to court.
00:23:59,00:24:02,"And during the divorce proceedings, one of the sticking points,"
00:24:02,00:24:06,"which the judge got frustrated about, was the fact that the couple couldn't decide"
00:24:06,00:24:09,how to split up their Beanie Baby collection.
00:24:09,00:24:15,"And in the courtroom, the judge ordered them to actually split them up in the room"
00:24:15,00:24:22,by pouring the Beanie Babies onto the floor and getting them to each pick one one at a time.
00:24:22,00:24:24,"Oh, like you pick a football team?"
00:24:24,00:24:26,"Yes, exactly, like a football team."
00:24:26,00:24:29,"And my favorite paragraph in the article is,"
00:24:29,00:24:31,"""I don't agree with the judge's decision to do this."
00:24:31,00:24:35,"It's ridiculous and embarrassing,"" Francis Mountain said,"
00:24:35,00:24:39,"""moments before squatting on the courtroom floor alongside her ex-husband"
00:24:39,00:24:44,"to choose the first from a pile of stuffed toys."""
00:24:44,00:24:46,"We're going to have to move on, guys, to our next fact."
00:24:46,00:24:47,"Yeah, we can. Yeah, should we do it?"
00:24:47,00:24:53,"Okay, it is time for fact number three, and that is my fact."
00:24:53,00:24:58,"My fact this week is that due to the interests of its production coordinator,"
00:24:58,00:25:05,"Michigan State University's Planetarium not only dedicates itself to space science education,"
00:25:05,00:25:11,but also houses the world's only moist towelette museum.
00:25:11,00:25:17,"And this is it here, the moist towelette museum, showing a picture to the audience here."
00:25:17,00:25:22,"It's basically what it is, is there's this big Planetarium at the Michigan State University"
00:25:22,00:25:26,"and their production coordinator, a guy called John French,"
00:25:26,00:25:30,"just opened the door to his office, put up a sign, and started displaying all the..."
00:25:30,00:25:32,"Yeah, I would say, Dan, can we explain this?"
00:25:32,00:25:36,"Like, maybe describe it to the people at home, because it doesn't really look like an office."
00:25:36,00:25:39,It just looks like a filing cabinet.
00:25:39,00:25:44,"We're only seeing... So, on the left of the photo that we can see here is his computer and his desk."
00:25:44,00:25:51,"And what he's done is he's set up two cabinets that should have probably relevant things to his job on it,"
00:25:51,00:25:54,but he's emptied it and he's just covered it in moist towelettes.
00:25:54,00:25:59,"And he had this idea when he was at the Planetarium in Texas,"
00:25:59,00:26:06,"and he took a cabinet that had the Mars rover on it, and he put his moist towelettes on it,"
00:26:06,00:26:11,"and he said, ""I noticed that more people were looking at this cabinet when it had my moist towelettes on it"
00:26:11,00:26:14,"than when it had the Mars rover. Maybe I'm on to something."""
00:26:14,00:26:21,"And I guess no one had a choice in the matter, but he now runs the only museum that has it."
00:26:21,00:26:27,"And it's fascinating, he's got a thousand of these things, and people all over the world send it to him."
00:26:27,00:26:32,And moist towelettes are incredible. The variety out there that we have of them is...
00:26:32,00:26:34,"It's not that much, actually."
00:26:34,00:26:39,"Oh, no! I mean, there's specific ones to wipe on your fingers for when they're blackened by a typewriter."
00:26:39,00:26:46,"There are ones that you should use called ""radiac wash"" to wipe away when you're radioactively contaminated."
00:26:46,00:26:47,Wow!
00:26:47,00:26:49,What? I would hope.
00:26:49,00:26:54,"If I'd been contaminated by radiation, I'd hope for a little more attention from the authorities"
00:26:54,00:26:58,than a moist towelette.
00:26:58,00:27:03,That's very much the final thing we do after the big shower.
00:27:03,00:27:07,"No, there was just an air stewadess walking through Chernobyl, okay?"
00:27:07,00:27:09,"A moist towel, anyone?"
00:27:09,00:27:14,"Dan, this is the most punishingly dull area of... I think we may ever have covered the moist..."
00:27:14,00:27:16,What? This is incredible!
00:27:16,00:27:21,"Well, I've been captured by it, too. Look, I found myself getting deep into moist towelette world"
00:27:21,00:27:24,"because there are interesting, very interesting elements to it."
00:27:24,00:27:30,"For example, did you know that 6% of moist towelettes are used on cars?"
00:27:30,00:27:32,Unbelievable.
00:27:32,00:27:33,You see?
00:27:33,00:27:36,"But that's interesting. Wet wipes. 6% used on cars. You wouldn't have thought that, would you?"
00:27:36,00:27:38,I wouldn't have thought that. I wouldn't have thought it.
00:27:38,00:27:44,"No, like, guys, give it a chance. This is a fascinating thing."
00:27:44,00:27:47,"French has been doing this, John French, for 20 years."
00:27:47,00:27:52,"And he's even found the holy grail of moist towelettes, which he's..."
00:27:52,00:27:56,The moist towelette that Christ used at the Last Supper.
00:27:56,00:27:58,The Turin towelette is...
00:27:58,00:28:01,I'm excited. It has his finger marks on it.
00:28:01,00:28:04,"No, he found... So he's only got it..."
00:28:04,00:28:08,John French has a website. I highly encourage you to check it out.
00:28:08,00:28:13,He can't reply to everyone who gets in contact with because he is inundated.
00:28:14,00:28:15,And there is an address.
00:28:15,00:28:20,"And if you'd like to send your own moist towelette to him, do send it unused."
00:28:20,00:28:23,He does have one which is used.
00:28:23,00:28:25,It's a celebrity one to be fair.
00:28:25,00:28:28,"So if you're a celebrity in the audience tonight, do use it first."
00:28:28,00:28:29,Who was it? Elvis or...
00:28:29,00:28:30,It was... No.
00:28:30,00:28:32,Do you mind if I take this one? Go for it.
00:28:32,00:28:35,It was donated by Tom and Ray Macliotsi.
00:28:35,00:28:37,So I don't need to tell you guys who they are.
00:28:37,00:28:41,"But for any listeners at home, they host NPR's car talk show."
00:28:41,00:28:46,And the moist towelette they sent him was used to clean off some grease from a car once.
00:28:46,00:28:48,"Oh, so one of the six per cent?"
00:28:48,00:28:49,There we are.
00:28:49,00:28:55,So you can understand why he made an exception for that incredibly famous towelette.
00:28:55,00:29:01,"But so on his website, he has what he says is the holy grail of moist towelettes."
00:29:01,00:29:02,They're just not sending it.
00:29:02,00:29:04,"Damn, for fuck's sake, tell us what this is."
00:29:04,00:29:07,So it's a series of Star Trek moist towelettes
00:29:07,00:29:10,which have the image of Captain Kirk and Spock on it.
00:29:10,00:29:12,I've seen them. I've seen the photo on his website.
00:29:12,00:29:15,"And yeah, they look impressive."
00:29:15,00:29:18,"Well, they just have a photo on the towel."
00:29:18,00:29:19,"No, it's not on the packaging."
00:29:19,00:29:20,It's on the packaging.
00:29:20,00:29:22,And we don't have that kind of technology.
00:29:22,00:29:23,You're going to put ink on it.
00:29:23,00:29:24,"Come on, Anna, calm down."
00:29:24,00:29:30,"Anyway, so I knew it was a good idea to do this fact tonight."
00:29:30,00:29:31,I can feel where...
00:29:31,00:29:35,Do you want to know something about the history of moist towelettes then?
00:29:35,00:29:36,Of course.
00:29:36,00:29:37,All together now?
00:29:37,00:29:38,Yes!
00:29:38,00:29:41,Great.
00:29:41,00:29:42,Someone said no.
00:29:42,00:29:43,Get out.
00:29:43,00:29:45,Out. Wrong room.
00:29:45,00:29:47,"Yeah, you do not belong here."
00:29:47,00:29:52,"Look, the reason they became the phenomenon they are today"
00:29:52,00:29:53,and the reason we're all so excited by them
00:29:53,00:29:57,is because of a guy called Arthur Julius and the Colonel.
00:29:57,00:30:01,So Kentucky Fried Chicken brought us moist towelettes.
00:30:01,00:30:04,And this is in 1958 and he invented it.
00:30:04,00:30:06,"And it was quite a big deal, right?"
00:30:06,00:30:11,The idea that you can have something that stays damp for so long
00:30:11,00:30:17,and that doesn't disintegrate when you're cleaning stuff
00:30:17,00:30:19,is pretty amazing technology.
00:30:19,00:30:20,"Absolutely, damn straight."
00:30:20,00:30:24,So he struck a deal with KFC.
00:30:24,00:30:30,"Struck a deal with KFC to provide a free wet wipe with every KFC meal,"
00:30:30,00:30:32,"which works because they're finger-licking good,"
00:30:32,00:30:35,but even licking your fingers sometimes isn't enough.
00:30:35,00:30:37,And that's where they took off.
00:30:37,00:30:41,"It is quite amazing, that kind of how moist they keep."
00:30:41,00:30:42,It's extraordinary.
00:30:42,00:30:43,Do you have data?
00:30:43,00:30:44,They advertised it.
00:30:44,00:30:47,KFC advertised it as what your tongue doesn't get.
00:30:47,00:30:48,The wet wipe will.
00:30:48,00:30:55,"Someone just commented, ""That's my Tinder bio."""
00:31:01,00:31:07,"In the last 25 years, KFC has given away nearly a billion wet wipes."
00:31:07,00:31:11,And those wet wipes would reach halfway to the moon.
00:31:11,00:31:13,"Overall, the amount of wet wipes of this company"
00:31:13,00:31:17,nice and clean have made in America is 150 billion.
00:31:17,00:31:21,"And that would go to the moon about 30 odd times, something like that."
00:31:21,00:31:21,Really?
00:31:21,00:31:22,So many.
00:31:22,00:31:23,Wow.
00:31:23,00:31:25,But the thing is about the moist towelettes
00:31:25,00:31:27,is they make so many of them
00:31:27,00:31:29,"and basically people flush them down the toilet, don't they?"
00:31:29,00:31:32,"So by the way, the fact that you've been cheering them so far"
00:31:32,00:31:37,is disgusting because they are basically the bad guys of the modern day.
00:31:37,00:31:38,"They're very bad, aren't they?"
00:31:38,00:31:38,Very bad.
00:31:38,00:31:40,They make fatbergs basically.
00:31:40,00:31:44,"And the biggest fatberg in the UK quite recently found in Liverpool,"
00:31:44,00:31:49,it weighed 400 tonnes and it was 250 metres long.
00:31:49,00:31:49,Wow.
00:31:49,00:31:53,"And if you add that one to one that was found in Birmingham in the same year,"
00:31:53,00:31:55,those two fatbergs alone would weigh more
00:31:55,00:31:58,than the giant statue of Christ in Rio de Janeiro.
00:31:58,00:31:59,Wow.
00:31:59,00:32:01,But no one has suggested a switch.
00:32:01,00:32:09,There was also a 2020 study in Ireland by Coastwatch
00:32:09,00:32:14,and they said that wet wipes are the main cause of microplastics in the sea.
00:32:14,00:32:16,"You know, like these tiny little bits of plastic"
00:32:16,00:32:19,and it's because little threads come off the wet wipes
00:32:19,00:32:20,and they end up in the sea.
00:32:20,00:32:22,And there's a teenager called Fionn Ferreira.
00:32:22,00:32:26,He's an Irish teenager and he's developed a technique
00:32:26,00:32:29,to remove this microplastics.
00:32:29,00:32:31,And this original fact was about planetariums.
00:32:31,00:32:32,Yeah.
00:32:32,00:32:37,And he also worked as a curator at Shull's Planetarium in County Cork.
00:32:37,00:32:37,No.
00:32:37,00:32:39,So it's another...
00:32:39,00:32:39,Yeah.
00:32:39,00:32:40,Wow.
00:32:40,00:32:44,So there's something about planetariums and wet wipes.
00:32:44,00:32:46,Were they just kind of drawn together?
00:32:46,00:32:48,"Well, just one extra coincidence."
00:32:48,00:32:50,"Yeah, there's a link."
00:32:50,00:32:56,"The first ever use of the word wet wipe, phrase wet wipe, was in 1966"
00:32:56,00:32:57,and it was from a NASA study.
00:32:57,00:32:59,This is really cool.
00:32:59,00:33:01,It was a study called Effective Diet and Atmosphere
00:33:01,00:33:03,on intestinal and skin flora.
00:33:03,00:33:05,So basically they were trying to work out
00:33:05,00:33:07,how's it that was sarcasm when I heard it.
00:33:07,00:33:10,It was a study.
00:33:10,00:33:13,"It was a study trying to work out the influence of space flight,"
00:33:13,00:33:15,what it would do to the microorganisms on your skin.
00:33:15,00:33:19,"And they got, I think, 16 men and they studied them,"
00:33:19,00:33:20,"I think, in space-like conditions."
00:33:20,00:33:22,I don't think they actually sent them to space.
00:33:22,00:33:25,And they were kept in one environment for 42 days
00:33:25,00:33:29,and they were being kept without doing much washing
00:33:29,00:33:32,and their microorganisms on their skin were being studied.
00:33:32,00:33:34,"Like areas including, I'm quoting here,"
00:33:34,00:33:39,"the ear, eyes, nails, umbilicus, anal fold, you name it."
00:33:39,00:33:40,The umbilicus.
00:33:40,00:33:41,"Yeah, the belly button."
00:33:41,00:33:41,Belly button.
00:33:41,00:33:42,The belly button.
00:33:42,00:33:43,"Yeah, we'll just go with the fucking belly button, guys."
00:33:43,00:33:45,"Yeah, yeah."
00:33:45,00:33:46,I'm quite a NASA here.
00:33:46,00:33:46,Yeah.
00:33:46,00:33:47,But anyway.
00:33:47,00:33:48,But what's anal fold?
00:33:48,00:33:50,"Oh, do you not have one?"
00:33:50,00:33:51,We've all...
00:33:51,00:33:51,Ass crack.
00:33:51,00:33:53,Is that what it means?
00:33:53,00:33:56,I can't believe I'm having to do all this translation
00:33:56,00:33:57,from this side of the room.
00:33:57,00:33:59,Is that genuinely what NASA calls our butt crack?
00:33:59,00:34:00,Anal fold.
00:34:00,00:34:00,I'm afraid so.
00:34:00,00:34:02,"Anal fold, yeah."
00:34:02,00:34:05,"But, get this, the way they were allowed to clean themselves"
00:34:05,00:34:06,"in this study was as follows,"
00:34:06,00:34:08,"and this is where we get the phrase wet wipes from,"
00:34:08,00:34:12,only wet wipes were allowed and were limited to three a day
00:34:12,00:34:15,for hand wiping following eating and defecation.
00:34:15,00:34:19,That was all the cleaning they were allowed to do.
00:34:19,00:34:20,Three wet wipes a day.
00:34:20,00:34:22,Would you poo once a day and eat twice a day?
00:34:23,00:34:25,Or vice versa?
00:34:25,00:34:27,I think the number of times you poo on a day
00:34:27,00:34:28,depends on how much you eat a day.
00:34:28,00:34:29,That's a good point.
00:34:29,00:34:31,"Well, they're not allowed to correspond, James, so..."
00:34:31,00:34:35,"I would go for, like, three nil, but on alternate days."
00:34:35,00:34:36,"Yeah, I love that."
00:34:36,00:34:39,"Guys, we're going to have to move on very soon"
00:34:39,00:34:40,to our next fact.
00:34:40,00:34:41,Our final fact.
00:34:41,00:34:43,Shall I quickly just tell you one thing
00:34:43,00:34:44,about planetarium?
00:34:44,00:34:44,It's our planetarium.
00:34:44,00:34:45,Yeah.
00:34:45,00:34:47,"One of my favourite ones is in Moscow,"
00:34:47,00:34:47,Moscow Planetarium.
00:34:47,00:34:48,I've been there.
00:34:48,00:34:49,"It's really, really good."
00:34:49,00:34:52,"They have a really, really massive dome,"
00:34:52,00:34:54,and what is cool about it is the outer dome
00:34:54,00:34:57,is only eight centimetres thick at the top.
00:34:57,00:34:59,It goes down to 12 centimetres thick at the bottom.
00:34:59,00:35:01,"It's really, really thin."
00:35:01,00:35:03,"And that means that if you shrunk it down,"
00:35:03,00:35:05,it would be thinner than an eggshell.
00:35:05,00:35:05,This is this planetarium.
00:35:05,00:35:07,If it was the size of an egg.
00:35:07,00:35:08,If it was the size of an egg.
00:35:08,00:35:09,That's amazing.
00:35:09,00:35:12,"And the reason I bring it up is for you, Andy, really,"
00:35:12,00:35:14,because it has a load of insulation in this.
00:35:14,00:35:15,And guess what it's made of?
00:35:15,00:35:16,Oh.
00:35:16,00:35:17,Is it moss?
00:35:17,00:35:17,It's moss.
00:35:17,00:35:18,Yes!
00:35:18,00:35:24,[APPLAUSE]
00:35:24,00:35:27,"OK, it is time for our final fact of the show,"
00:35:27,00:35:29,and that is Anna.
00:35:29,00:35:32,My fact this week is that 72 years
00:35:32,00:35:35,"after the first Miss America contest,"
00:35:35,00:35:38,"the runner-up was still claiming I won it, hands down."
00:35:38,00:35:42,"So this was 1921,"
00:35:42,00:35:44,and at the time it was called the Intercity Beauty Contest.
00:35:44,00:35:46,"It was an Atlantic City,"
00:35:46,00:35:48,"and the official winner,"
00:35:48,00:35:50,"according to the Miss America history,"
00:35:50,00:35:52,"it was a woman called a girl,"
00:35:52,00:35:54,a 16-year-old girl called Margaret Gorman.
00:35:54,00:35:57,"But there was also Miss Virginia Lee,"
00:35:57,00:35:59,"who was about 20, 21,"
00:35:59,00:36:02,a bit too old almost for Miss America.
00:36:02,00:36:06,And so it was between Virginia and Margaret.
00:36:06,00:36:08,"Everyone was saying they're the two best,"
00:36:08,00:36:10,whatever you're supposed to be good at.
00:36:10,00:36:14,"And then when the contest had ended,"
00:36:14,00:36:16,"before the results were announced,"
00:36:16,00:36:18,"and this is the first ever Miss America,"
00:36:18,00:36:20,suddenly Virginia is disqualified.
00:36:20,00:36:21,And she was disqualified for being a professional.
00:36:21,00:36:23,It wasn't made clear before the contest
00:36:23,00:36:26,"that it was amateurs only, but..."
00:36:26,00:36:27,What is a professional in this context
00:36:27,00:36:29,where the criterion is just being fit?
00:36:29,00:36:33,"Right, that's a huge misconception."
00:36:33,00:36:37,"And B, I think everyone else had won local beauty contests"
00:36:37,00:36:40,"and then been upgraded to the National Beauty Contest,"
00:36:40,00:36:42,whereas she just had a modelling contract for the magazine.
00:36:42,00:36:44,"Yeah, she was a model, I think, is the point."
00:36:44,00:36:47,"Yeah, and also one of the judges of the competition"
00:36:47,00:36:50,ran the magazine that employed her as a model.
00:36:50,00:36:51,And perhaps that was all discovered.
00:36:51,00:36:53,"And anyway, she was quite bitter about it."
00:36:53,00:36:57,"And she always claimed that they told her even years afterward,"
00:36:57,00:36:58,"""Look, you won it really,"
00:36:58,00:37:00,"""but they said we can't give it to you,"
00:37:00,00:37:01,"""so this other woman won it."""
00:37:01,00:37:04,So that's the controversial start to Miss America.
00:37:04,00:37:07,"Yeah, it was quite an interesting event, wasn't it?"
00:37:07,00:37:13,"Because these women were brought on with King Neptune,"
00:37:14,00:37:16,"who was a one-handed inventor,"
00:37:16,00:37:19,brother of friend of the podcast Hiram Maxim.
00:37:19,00:37:22,"So Hiram Maxim, who invented the machine gun,"
00:37:22,00:37:26,"his brother was this guy, he was dressed as King Neptune."
00:37:26,00:37:31,He only had one hand because he'd lost it in a mercury explosion in 1894.
00:37:31,00:37:35,And he'd invented smokeless gunpowder.
00:37:35,00:37:39,Thomas Edison referred to him as the most versatile man in America.
00:37:39,00:37:42,It sounds pretty versatile if he's invented gunpowder
00:37:42,00:37:45,and simultaneously pretending to be King Neptune at a beauty contest.
00:37:45,00:37:48,That is the apex of the story.
00:37:48,00:37:52,"But yeah, and it was basically in order to stop people going home"
00:37:52,00:37:56,from Atlantic City because it was a big resort
00:37:56,00:37:57,"and people would go home at the end of the summer,"
00:37:57,00:37:59,but they wanted to keep people there.
00:37:59,00:38:01,So they had this extra thing to try and keep people there.
00:38:01,00:38:03,"Yeah, it was all part of the Fall Frolick."
00:38:03,00:38:04,Yeah.
00:38:04,00:38:07,So it was a whole big festival where they had lots of other stuff on.
00:38:07,00:38:10,"And actually, it was inspired by the Baby Parade,"
00:38:10,00:38:13,"which was really popular and had been since about 1900,"
00:38:13,00:38:18,where you wheeled out your fit baby in a pram and people judged it.
00:38:18,00:38:21,And then I was looking up.
00:38:21,00:38:22,What would they do with it?
00:38:22,00:38:23,Was there a talent round?
00:38:23,00:38:24,Was there?
00:38:24,00:38:27,It was more like you looked at them and you put them in a nice bonnet
00:38:27,00:38:28,and you wheeled them around.
00:38:28,00:38:32,"And actually, baby was a stretch because I read in one newspaper article"
00:38:32,00:38:37,"about 1928 that the baby parade, you had to be between six and 12 years old."
00:38:37,00:38:40,"But then the following year, a three-year-old won it."
00:38:40,00:38:41,Wow.
00:38:41,00:38:45,"You know, there are the sort of interview sections in the pageants."
00:38:45,00:38:49,"You know, there was the swimsuit round until very, very recently in one of them."
00:38:49,00:38:54,"And anyway, in 2011, here are samples of the Miss USA questions."
00:38:54,00:38:58,"Which, just to be really clear, Miss USA is completely different to Miss America."
00:38:58,00:38:59,"Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:38:59,00:39:03,"Anyway, the questions in 2011 included asking whether evolution"
00:39:03,00:39:07,"should be taught in schools, which is frankly a poser."
00:39:07,00:39:09,"I mean, you could spend hours talking about that in your answer."
00:39:09,00:39:13,And should the US Constitution protect the burning of religious books?
00:39:13,00:39:14,Oh my God.
00:39:14,00:39:18,"To be fair, contestants were also asked if they could make the sounds of a cat,"
00:39:18,00:39:20,a police siren and a slot machine.
00:39:20,00:39:22,A slot machine?
00:39:22,00:39:25,Amazing.
00:39:25,00:39:28,"It's quite nice because when you read about the history of Miss America,"
00:39:28,00:39:31,"from the start, women have just been really skeptical about it."
00:39:31,00:39:35,And the biggest controversy was back in 1938.
00:39:35,00:39:39,"Well, in fact, in 1938, Miss America contestants were banned."
00:39:39,00:39:41,The interview round was very hard then.
00:39:41,00:39:43,What do you think about the annexation of Austria?
00:39:43,00:39:48,"Do you think Chamberlain might have actually been right to declare peace in our time,"
00:39:48,00:39:52,given that that gave Britain vital time to rearm in the anticipation
00:39:52,00:39:54,of an inevitable war next year?
00:39:54,00:39:57,"It was slightly too early for the Chamberlain question, but yeah."
00:39:57,00:39:59,Idiot.
00:40:03,00:40:08,"No, in 1938, Miss America contestants were banned from spending time alone with a man"
00:40:08,00:40:10,for the week before the pageant results were announced.
00:40:10,00:40:15,"And that was because in 1937, and this is a huge deal, Miss America,"
00:40:15,00:40:18,"but the winner of Miss America, instead of being there for the ceremony"
00:40:18,00:40:21,"when the crown was placed on her head, was absent because she'd run off"
00:40:21,00:40:26,with her chaperone for the week and the crown had to be placed on an empty chair.
00:40:26,00:40:27,Oh wow.
00:40:27,00:40:29,It's such a good story.
00:40:29,00:40:31,"Just give it to someone else, wouldn't you?"
00:40:31,00:40:33,"Well, no, they had to stand by their principles, and their principles were that"
00:40:33,00:40:35,Bette Cooper had won.
00:40:35,00:40:36,Wow.
00:40:36,00:40:37,And Bette Cooper didn't give a shit.
00:40:37,00:40:44,"The only reason she'd entered was because her family kind of wanted a holiday in New Jersey,"
00:40:44,00:40:46,"and they were kind of against the contest, but they were like,"
00:40:46,00:40:48,"""Come on, our daughter's not going to win. Look at her."""
00:40:48,00:40:53,"And genuinely, they were like, ""You'll never win, so it's fine."""
00:40:53,00:40:56,"And she did win, and they had a chaperone for the week,"
00:40:56,00:40:59,like a driver to drive them around the event the week before the event.
00:40:59,00:41:00,And she liked him.
00:41:00,00:41:01,She started flirting with him.
00:41:01,00:41:05,"He was called Louis Off, and she ran off with him."
00:41:05,00:41:07,Nice.
00:41:07,00:41:12,"They did have, genuinely, it was in the contract, and this is Miss America,"
00:41:12,00:41:18,where they would say that you had to pledge a vow to not having been either married or pregnant
00:41:18,00:41:20,in order to enter the competition.
00:41:20,00:41:23,"Like, they were so stringent on the idea that you had to be this pure person."
00:41:23,00:41:28,"And there were countless examples, again, just the fact that the women who did enter it"
00:41:28,00:41:29,buckled the system when they won.
00:41:29,00:41:34,"A lot of them just saying, ""I'm not playing up to the thing that you're expecting of me."""
00:41:34,00:41:38,But they did have all these clauses that you had to do as you were going in.
00:41:38,00:41:39,They still do.
00:41:39,00:41:40,"Yeah, they still do."
00:41:40,00:41:42,"I can't be married, but they..."
00:41:42,00:41:43,"Well, there is Mrs. World."
00:41:43,00:41:44,There is Mrs. World.
00:41:44,00:41:46,"Genuinely, that really is a competition."
00:41:46,00:41:48,"There is Mrs. World, which is for married women."
00:41:48,00:41:51,"But they had a huge row last year, because at the prize giving,"
00:41:51,00:41:56,"one of the contestants punched the winner and ripped the crown off her head,"
00:41:56,00:41:58,"saying, ""You're divorced."""
00:41:58,00:42:01,"And then... Like, genuinely, this happened."
00:42:01,00:42:05,"And the winner said, ""I'm separated. I'm not divorced."""
00:42:05,00:42:08,And so... Wow.
00:42:08,00:42:10,"Great Mrs. World, Canada, if the marriage was broken down that far."
00:42:10,00:42:14,"If you are divorced, are you allowed to go back into the Miss America or...?"
00:42:14,00:42:18,"That's miss annulment, you're thinking of, which is completely different, yeah."
00:42:18,00:42:22,There was a controversy in Miss World in 2013.
00:42:22,00:42:24,This was Miss Uzbekistan.
00:42:24,00:42:29,The Uzbekistan officials said that she'd left a few things off her profile.
00:42:29,00:42:33,"Namely, the fact that the country has never held a Miss Uzbekistan contest."
00:42:33,00:42:37,And they had literally no idea who she was.
00:42:37,00:42:40,"She just rocked up and she went, ""Yeah, I miss Uzbekistan."""
00:42:40,00:42:41,"And they went, ""All right."""
00:42:41,00:42:42,That's awesome.
00:42:42,00:42:43,That's big brain time.
00:42:43,00:42:45,That is. That's amazing.
00:42:45,00:42:47,How did she do it? Did they keep her in or did she...?
00:42:47,00:42:50,"They kept her in. Yeah, she didn't do particularly well."
00:42:50,00:42:52,"But she, yeah, she stayed in the competition."
00:42:52,00:42:53,That's so good.
00:42:53,00:42:58,"Uganda, for the Miss Uganda contest in 2014, you have to milk a cow."
00:42:58,00:43:02,"And this was when Museveni, President of Uganda,"
00:43:02,00:43:06,"2014, sent the army in to run the Miss Uganda contest"
00:43:06,00:43:09,because he decided they weren't promoting the right kind of values.
00:43:09,00:43:11,"He was like, ""He doesn't have the right priorities."""
00:43:11,00:43:15,But so their questions have all been quizzed on farming techniques.
00:43:15,00:43:18,"You know, which udder do you pull, which seed do you sow...?"
00:43:18,00:43:20,Which udder do you pull?
00:43:20,00:43:21,Which udder do you pull?
00:43:21,00:43:22,Pull the udder one.
00:43:22,00:43:25,There we go.
00:43:25,00:43:31,"And Miss Navajo, you have to know how to butcher a sheep properly."
00:43:31,00:43:31,Miss what?
00:43:31,00:43:34,"Navajo, like the Native American people."
00:43:34,00:43:37,There's one question that once someone got in 2012.
00:43:37,00:43:40,"They were asked, ""What are you supposed to do with a sheep's head?"
00:43:40,00:43:41,"Any ideas?"""
00:43:41,00:43:45,"Depends really what your interests are, I suppose."
00:43:47,00:43:51,Is that the ventriloquism act that comes up later in the talent round?
00:43:51,00:43:54,Let's say if you want to cook it.
00:43:54,00:43:55,I'd curry it.
00:43:55,00:43:56,"Sheep's head, yeah?"
00:43:56,00:43:59,"Yeah, you can't taste any of it in the end, can you?"
00:43:59,00:44:02,"Yeah, not in the Navajo people because this is all about there."
00:44:02,00:44:06,You have to know all about the Navajo customs from history.
00:44:06,00:44:08,"Julianne, chocolate julienne."
00:44:08,00:44:09,No.
00:44:09,00:44:13,You wrap it in aluminium foil and put it on the fire.
00:44:13,00:44:16,"Ah, can't be that old a tradition if it involves aluminium foil."
00:44:17,00:44:20,And a couple of wet wipes and you're done.
00:44:20,00:44:24,"No, the person who answered that question,"
00:44:24,00:44:27,"even though they kind of got it right because that is the modern way of doing it,"
00:44:27,00:44:29,they got booed because they answered in English
00:44:29,00:44:32,"and you were supposed to answer in Navajo, but they can't remember the words."
00:44:32,00:44:34,"Yeah, the Navajo for aluminium foil."
00:44:34,00:44:38,I want to talk about the outrage of beauty contests
00:44:38,00:44:42,"leading to people feeling pressured to have plastic surgery,"
00:44:43,00:44:45,work done when they shouldn't.
00:44:45,00:44:47,And the worst thing was this December just gone.
00:44:47,00:44:51,It was a contest in Saudi Arabia and it was the camel beauty contest
00:44:51,00:44:55,where 40 camels had to be disqualified
00:44:55,00:44:58,because they'd had Botox and facelifts.
00:44:58,00:44:58,Oh.
00:44:58,00:45:03,Those humps look suspiciously pert to me.
00:45:03,00:45:08,It's a real issue.
00:45:08,00:45:12,"There's $66 million worth of prize money up for grabs,"
00:45:12,00:45:16,"but you are not allowed to enhance in any way the camel's heads,"
00:45:16,00:45:22,"necks, humps, dress or posture and dozens of breeders did."
00:45:22,00:45:25,How are they manipulating the camel's looks?
00:45:25,00:45:28,They gave them Botox to inflate their body parts.
00:45:28,00:45:31,They also had rubber bands that inflated their body parts
00:45:31,00:45:33,in ways that I don't understand.
00:45:33,00:45:34,"To be honest, for this prize money,"
00:45:34,00:45:37,I'm willing to dress up as a camel and go to Saudi Arabia.
00:45:37,00:45:39,"Oh, well, I think you think a lot of yourself,"
00:45:39,00:45:40,"if you think you dressed up as a camel,"
00:45:40,00:45:43,will be more attractive than an actual camel.
00:45:43,00:45:44,I do.
00:45:44,00:45:46,"James, I back myself on this one."
00:45:46,00:45:49,In a camel beauty contest where you're looking for something
00:45:49,00:45:53,"with two humps, a nice long face and Andy thinks,"
00:45:53,00:45:55,"""Nah, I could just dress up as a camel and win it."""
00:45:55,00:45:58,"I've got a nice long face and I think the humps,"
00:45:58,00:45:59,I'll sort something out.
00:45:59,00:46:03,"We've got to wrap up, guys."
00:46:03,00:46:03,Okay.
00:46:03,00:46:06,"Yeah, James, do you want to lob one more thing in or are we?"
00:46:06,00:46:07,I can if you want.
00:46:08,00:46:12,There is this thing in China where models will be given a job
00:46:12,00:46:13,"and they'll be saying, ""Oh, come over here."
00:46:13,00:46:15,"It's like a modeling job."""
00:46:15,00:46:18,And then they're told to pretend to be like Miss America
00:46:18,00:46:20,or Miss Brazil or whatever.
00:46:20,00:46:23,"And there was someone who was from Brazil,"
00:46:23,00:46:24,who was pretending to be Miss Chile.
00:46:24,00:46:28,Someone from Ukraine who was pretending to be a Miss America.
00:46:28,00:46:30,And the reason is that they take them
00:46:30,00:46:33,to these like tiny little towns in the middle of nowhere
00:46:33,00:46:35,and they say they're not going to know
00:46:35,00:46:37,what Miss America is supposed to look like.
00:46:37,00:46:39,So I'm just going to put a sash on you
00:46:39,00:46:41,and we're going to pretend that we've managed to fly in
00:46:41,00:46:44,all of these beauty contest winners from all around the world.
00:46:44,00:46:46,It's like amazing.
00:46:46,00:46:47,We're going to go.
00:46:47,00:46:50,I'm going to sign the fittest camel in Saudi Arabia 2022.
00:46:50,00:46:56,"All right, look, we need to wrap up."
00:46:56,00:46:56,That is it.
00:46:56,00:46:58,That is all of our facts.
