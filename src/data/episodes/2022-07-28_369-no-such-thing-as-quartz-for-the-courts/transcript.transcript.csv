00:00:14,00:00:18,"Hello and welcome to another episode of No Such Thing as a Fish,"
00:00:18,00:00:23,a weekly podcast coming to you from four undisclosed locations in the UK.
00:00:23,00:00:24,My name is Dan Schreiber.
00:00:24,00:00:29,"I'm sitting here with Anna Tyshinski, Andrew Hunter Murray, and James Harkin."
00:00:29,00:00:33,"And once again, we have gathered round the microphones with our four favorite facts"
00:00:33,00:00:38,"from the last seven days, and in no particular order, here we go."
00:00:38,00:00:39,"Starting with you, Andy."
00:00:39,00:00:45,My fact is that the doctor who invented the first decent thermometer suitable for rectal use
00:00:45,00:00:47,was named Thomas Orbutt.
00:00:47,00:00:51,"It's the ultimate in nominative determinism, isn't it?"
00:00:51,00:00:52,It is.
00:00:52,00:00:58,"Yeah, it's just a cheap joke at the expense of a brilliant doctor who has done a lot more"
00:00:58,00:00:59,for the world than I ever will.
00:00:59,00:01:04,Do you think I was trying to look into whether or not he got any sort of
00:01:04,00:01:05,shtick for it at the time?
00:01:05,00:01:08,"If anyone made any jokes about it, couldn't see anything."
00:01:08,00:01:09,It was just pure respect for the man.
00:01:09,00:01:11,"Wow, missing a trick in those days, weren't they?"
00:01:11,00:01:12,Idiots.
00:01:12,00:01:13,When was this?
00:01:13,00:01:15,It was like ten of the...
00:01:15,00:01:16,It was the 1860s.
00:01:16,00:01:18,"He invented it in 1866, I think."
00:01:18,00:01:20,"He worked with the manufacturers on the design,"
00:01:20,00:01:25,and then he wrote an essay about it in 1868 in which he sort of described his making a bit.
00:01:25,00:01:29,It's important to say he himself was an armpit man.
00:01:29,00:01:31,What?
00:01:31,00:01:33,Why do we need to know about his kinks?
00:01:33,00:01:37,He said it's better to put...
00:01:37,00:01:40,Because basically it was the first decent thermometer for use on patients.
00:01:40,00:01:43,"All the ones before that took about 20 minutes to get a good reading,"
00:01:43,00:01:47,"and some of them were a foot long, and some of them were even longer than that."
00:01:47,00:01:49,"I mean, it was the Wild West out there."
00:01:49,00:01:55,"He created a much more reliable one, which was shorter and took very few minutes to get a reading,"
00:01:55,00:01:57,"but he himself said, look, the armpit is better."
00:01:57,00:02:02,"And he wrote this essay saying that if patients allow single rectal examinations,"
00:02:02,00:02:06,"which is doubtful, they will certainly rebel against their frequent repetition."
00:02:06,00:02:09,And this is as true of the coarser as the more sensitive natures.
00:02:09,00:02:12,"For in the former class of patients, the coarser variety,"
00:02:12,00:02:15,"my assistants and myself have by such examinations,"
00:02:15,00:02:18,"rectal examinations, excited comments,"
00:02:18,00:02:21,the narration of which would not tend to edification.
00:02:21,00:02:22,Wow.
00:02:22,00:02:25,What does he mean by coarser?
00:02:25,00:02:28,Does he mean people who seem like they're really hard?
00:02:28,00:02:29,"Socially, Rafa."
00:02:29,00:02:32,"Yeah, I mean, he was a doctor in Leeds, wasn't he?"
00:02:32,00:02:34,So you can imagine his Yorkshire.
00:02:34,00:02:37,"Yeah, put in that thermometer anywhere near my ass."
00:02:37,00:02:44,"But he was a proper, good, famous doctor, wasn't he, in Leeds?"
00:02:44,00:02:48,His mother was a friend of the Brontes.
00:02:48,00:02:51,He himself was a friend of George Elliott.
00:02:51,00:02:54,"And apparently, a character, I haven't read Middlemarch,"
00:02:54,00:02:57,but I know Anna and Andy at least haven't done my half as well.
00:02:57,00:03:02,"But a character called Lidgate in Middlemarch, supposedly based on him, supposedly."
00:03:02,00:03:04,That makes sense. He is the doctor character.
00:03:04,00:03:08,I wouldn't surprise if it was Dorothea.
00:03:08,00:03:12,His father was a rector.
00:03:12,00:03:16,Father was a rector and he was a rectal prober.
00:03:16,00:03:20,"Well, his father was the rector of a place in Suffolk called"
00:03:20,00:03:22,the back cum bulge.
00:03:22,00:03:25,"No, what?"
00:03:25,00:03:29,That's a great link.
00:03:29,00:03:30,Really? It's so good.
00:03:30,00:03:34,"Well, I love the literary links, as you were saying, James, with George Elliott."
00:03:34,00:03:38,They were really good friends and she wrote about him a lot.
00:03:38,00:03:41,"And that we have one quote particular, which she says,"
00:03:41,00:03:44,"""A good, clever, graceful man enough to enable one to be cheerful"
00:03:44,00:03:47,"under the horrible smoke of ugly Leeds."""
00:03:49,00:03:50,I think they went then.
00:03:50,00:03:53,"Yeah, in fairness, that was a trip that George Elliott"
00:03:53,00:03:56,and her friend were making from Leeds to Bolton.
00:03:56,00:03:58,"And if you're going to go to Bolton,"
00:03:58,00:03:59,"anywhere is going to look ugly, isn't it?"
00:03:59,00:04:02,Was it actually?
00:04:02,00:04:03,Yeah.
00:04:03,00:04:06,You must have been so excited by that.
00:04:06,00:04:08,Did she give then a bucolic description of Bolton?
00:04:08,00:04:10,I couldn't. I looked.
00:04:10,00:04:12,"I must admit, I looked."
00:04:12,00:04:15,And I was more excited of finding out that she went to Bolton
00:04:15,00:04:18,than I was about finding out his dad was from the back cum bulge.
00:04:19,00:04:20,That's how excited I was.
00:04:20,00:04:24,"Wow, when something excites you more than a rude name,"
00:04:24,00:04:25,you know you're a business.
00:04:25,00:04:31,"Yeah, he was kind of had an unrivaled reputation"
00:04:31,00:04:32,"in that area, I think."
00:04:32,00:04:35,And then he quit doctoring in the late '80s
00:04:35,00:04:38,and became commissioner for lunacy
00:04:38,00:04:40,and kind of looked at mental health problems.
00:04:40,00:04:42,"And the reason that he left, no one was quite sure why he left,"
00:04:42,00:04:46,but they think it might be because his uncle was very badly treated.
00:04:46,00:04:48,His uncle was called Henry All Butt.
00:04:48,00:04:53,"And he had written a book called The Wife's Handbook in 1885,"
00:04:53,00:04:56,which described contraceptive methods for women.
00:04:56,00:05:00,"And the people at the time thought that this should not be allowed,"
00:05:00,00:05:02,especially for working-class women.
00:05:02,00:05:05,And he was struck off from the medical register in 1887
00:05:05,00:05:07,because he'd written this book about contraception.
00:05:07,00:05:11,"He said, ""Knowledge may be all right for the rich lady"
00:05:11,00:05:13,who can afford to buy a guinea medical book
00:05:13,00:05:15,"and pay a big fee to a doctor,"
00:05:15,00:05:17,but it is an offence of an infamous character
00:05:17,00:05:20,"for a physician to write and sell a book at sixpence,"
00:05:20,00:05:22,"showing the poor how to better their hard lot."""
00:05:22,00:05:24,That is really interesting.
00:05:24,00:05:25,"God, what a family."
00:05:25,00:05:26,"I know, amazing, eh?"
00:05:26,00:05:27,Yeah.
00:05:27,00:05:29,"Apparently, not a good sense of humour, though."
00:05:29,00:05:31,"On the downside,"
00:05:31,00:05:33,Paul calling to one biography friends called him
00:05:33,00:05:36,"""caughtly and aristocratic in demeanour,"
00:05:36,00:05:38,"gracious of mind and bearing,"
00:05:38,00:05:40,"but serious and somewhat humorless."""
00:05:40,00:05:43,So he couldn't have seen the comedy in his own name.
00:05:43,00:05:44,So sad.
00:05:44,00:05:46,"Oh, that is tragic, yeah."
00:05:46,00:05:49,The first person to decide that temperature
00:05:49,00:05:52,"in a healthy person is always going to be about the same,"
00:05:52,00:05:55,"and that if you have a high or low temperature,"
00:05:55,00:05:57,"it could be due to your disease,"
00:05:57,00:05:59,was a guy called Carl Wunderlich.
00:05:59,00:06:02,Wow.
00:06:02,00:06:04,And he came up with that in 1868.
00:06:04,00:06:07,And what excited me about that at first
00:06:07,00:06:09,is because I did know of another Wunderlich
00:06:09,00:06:11,that I'd read about recently.
00:06:11,00:06:12,That's JÃ¶rg Wunderlich.
00:06:12,00:06:16,And he found very recently the world's oldest known erection.
00:06:16,00:06:19,This was in a spider.
00:06:19,00:06:21,"Spiders don't always have erections,"
00:06:21,00:06:22,but some of the old ones did.
00:06:22,00:06:24,And it was a harvestman.
00:06:24,00:06:28,"And 99 million years ago, it had a erection"
00:06:28,00:06:32,and then was killed by some flowing sap from a tree
00:06:32,00:06:34,which froze it in place.
00:06:34,00:06:37,And this knocked back the earliest erection
00:06:37,00:06:40,by something like 30 or 40 million years.
00:06:40,00:06:41,Wow.
00:06:41,00:06:45,Did that previous oldest erection just immediately go flaccid?
00:06:45,00:06:50,"Anyway, that's your Wunderlich."
00:06:50,00:06:53,"That's so perfect, because obviously erections"
00:06:53,00:06:55,"are often caused by a Wunderlich, aren't they?"
00:06:55,00:06:58,"So it's extreme, just explaining the normative determinism"
00:06:58,00:07:00,for anyone who didn't make the link.
00:07:00,00:07:01,"Thanks, Hannah."
00:07:01,00:07:03,"James, are they related to these Wunderlichs?"
00:07:03,00:07:04,Or are you just using it as an excuse
00:07:04,00:07:05,to talk about spider penises?
00:07:05,00:07:08,"Andy, I spent so much time going through"
00:07:09,00:07:12,"if the Wunderlich family ever needs any genealogy,"
00:07:12,00:07:14,"I could help them so much,"
00:07:14,00:07:16,because I looked through their entire family tree.
00:07:16,00:07:18,Let's see through some really old records
00:07:18,00:07:21,to try and find evidence of these two Wunderlichs were related.
00:07:21,00:07:23,I was just picturing you in the British library
00:07:23,00:07:27,surrounded by dusty tomes all open to the Wunderlich page.
00:07:27,00:07:33,I was thinking about the modern-day thermometers.
00:07:33,00:07:36,We've all used a lot recently over the last year.
00:07:36,00:07:39,"And we've all thought, ""Is this really working?"""
00:07:39,00:07:42,When you go into a public building or a place of work
00:07:42,00:07:44,or a pub when we were allowed to go into pubs
00:07:44,00:07:46,and you're standing in front of those thermometers
00:07:46,00:07:48,and they tell you what your temperature is.
00:07:48,00:07:48,The forehead gun.
00:07:48,00:07:51,"Or also just a screen sometimes, isn't it?"
00:07:51,00:07:55,"Yeah, a screen, a forehead gun, the non-touch thermometers."
00:07:55,00:07:56,"And I don't know about you guys,"
00:07:56,00:07:59,"but often you get a reading that is ridiculous,"
00:07:59,00:08:01,like 33.5 or something.
00:08:01,00:08:04,But then I always take the screen off and put it up my rectum.
00:08:04,00:08:09,They've had to replace those on the BBC so many times.
00:08:09,00:08:12,But they are very unreliable.
00:08:12,00:08:14,"So the FDA, the Food and Drug Administration,"
00:08:14,00:08:17,"found, first of all, that the seven widely used ones,"
00:08:17,00:08:19,"seven of the most widely used ones, what they do is,"
00:08:19,00:08:22,"they compensate for imprecision and unpredictability,"
00:08:22,00:08:24,"which can be caused by, like, if it's a very hot day"
00:08:24,00:08:27,or if you've just cycled to the work or something.
00:08:27,00:08:30,"They compensate for that by normalizing the readings,"
00:08:30,00:08:33,which essentially means that if they find a reading
00:08:33,00:08:35,"that they think is too extreme, they bring it down again."
00:08:35,00:08:36,"Really? Oh, my God."
00:08:36,00:08:38,"I find that really interesting,"
00:08:38,00:08:39,"because I am quite a sweaty man,"
00:08:39,00:08:41,especially when I've been cycling.
00:08:41,00:08:44,And I always cycle to the studios when we made QI.
00:08:44,00:08:48,"And I always think I must be in the high 50s, my temperature."
00:08:48,00:08:50,"But it always comes up as 30, whatever."
00:08:50,00:08:51,I don't know what it is.
00:08:51,00:08:53,I'm totally with you. I'm so with you.
00:08:53,00:08:55,There must be a way for people to fail the readings.
00:08:55,00:08:57,"Otherwise, what is the point?"
00:08:57,00:08:58,There is.
00:08:58,00:08:59,So that's quite a broad overview of what they do.
00:08:59,00:09:01,"So basically, the study found that you could have"
00:09:01,00:09:02,"a core temperature of about 38.5,"
00:09:02,00:09:04,and it would readjust to 36.6.
00:09:04,00:09:06,And its algorithms are trying to compensate
00:09:06,00:09:08,for various other environmental factors
00:09:08,00:09:09,that they think might be happening.
00:09:09,00:09:11,But it's unreliable enough
00:09:11,00:09:14,that you could also just have a temperature of 38.5
00:09:14,00:09:15,and register as 36.
00:09:15,00:09:17,"And they did another study in Australia, I think,"
00:09:17,00:09:20,"where they found that in five out of six cases,"
00:09:20,00:09:21,they missed a fever.
00:09:21,00:09:23,It's really interesting in terms of coronavirus.
00:09:23,00:09:26,There was one company called Kinsey Health
00:09:26,00:09:29,who have smartphone connected thermometers.
00:09:29,00:09:32,"And so basically, they've been gathering data"
00:09:32,00:09:34,for the last nine years.
00:09:34,00:09:36,"And in the lead-up to coronavirus,"
00:09:36,00:09:38,they basically spotted it
00:09:38,00:09:41,"because suddenly, there was this patch of high fevers"
00:09:41,00:09:42,around the whole country.
00:09:42,00:09:45,They said it was like this big swarm of just high fevers.
00:09:45,00:09:47,"And they were going, ""What the hell is this?"""
00:09:47,00:09:50,"And they tried to report it to various different people,"
00:09:50,00:09:52,but no one was taking the results as credible.
00:09:52,00:09:54,"And so they think for the future,"
00:09:54,00:09:58,these kind of smartphone-operated data-gathering thermometers
00:09:58,00:10:01,might prevent us from ever really going too far
00:10:01,00:10:04,down the line of an unrecognized pandemic.
00:10:04,00:10:05,I just want to stick up
00:10:05,00:10:07,"for the good old-fashioned mercury thermometers here,"
00:10:07,00:10:09,which is out of fashion
00:10:09,00:10:11,because apparently mercury is very dangerous.
00:10:11,00:10:14,And it turns out you can't buy mercury thermometers
00:10:14,00:10:14,any more in the UK.
00:10:14,00:10:18,I can't believe you don't know that.
00:10:18,00:10:20,I feel like they were bound in my childhood.
00:10:20,00:10:22,They were bound in 2009.
00:10:22,00:10:24,I think we had them at my school.
00:10:24,00:10:25,I think we had...
00:10:25,00:10:29,I remember some mercury smashing on the floor in my school
00:10:29,00:10:33,and everyone panicking and throwing sand on it and stuff.
00:10:33,00:10:35,I think it's perfectly safe to...
00:10:35,00:10:37,Is that mercury?
00:10:37,00:10:38,"As long as you don't inhale the fumes,"
00:10:38,00:10:40,"I think it's fine to swallow it, for example."
00:10:40,00:10:42,Are we saying that really?
00:10:42,00:10:43,"Well, it doesn't matter."
00:10:43,00:10:44,"No one's got one anymore, apparently,"
00:10:44,00:10:46,"apart from me and my parents,"
00:10:46,00:10:48,"who both work in the hat trade, and they're absolutely fine."
00:10:48,00:10:52,It's insane.
00:10:52,00:10:55,"The EU, the EU, I have to say,"
00:10:55,00:10:57,"the EU tried to ban barometers,"
00:10:57,00:10:58,"which also contain mercury,"
00:10:58,00:10:59,because they contain mercury.
00:10:59,00:11:00,Antique barometers.
00:11:00,00:11:03,This was a tiny amount of mercury.
00:11:03,00:11:03,"Oh, my God."
00:11:03,00:11:06,"Right, Nigel, you have lost a plot a bit here,"
00:11:06,00:11:08,and I think we should emphasize that mercury
00:11:08,00:11:10,can be very dangerous
00:11:10,00:11:13,if you smash one of those flimsy barometers.
00:11:13,00:11:15,"If anyone agrees with Andy,"
00:11:15,00:11:18,then there will be a rally at the White Cliffs of Dover.
00:11:18,00:11:19,Bring your own barometer.
00:11:19,00:11:24,"We'll all, together, smash the barometers"
00:11:24,00:11:27,and drink the mercury and prove.
00:11:27,00:11:31,And that is how survival of the fittest works.
00:11:31,00:11:32,"Well, you're like this, Andy."
00:11:32,00:11:35,You know who had mercury in them when they went to space?
00:11:35,00:11:38,"Oh, that does narrow it down."
00:11:38,00:11:39,"It does, doesn't it?"
00:11:39,00:11:40,Yeah.
00:11:40,00:11:40,Chong Glenn.
00:11:40,00:11:42,Chong Glenn would have.
00:11:42,00:11:43,The mercury astronauts.
00:11:43,00:11:45,"Oh, you're kidding."
00:11:45,00:11:46,So they had mercury.
00:11:46,00:11:48,"Well, to an extent,"
00:11:48,00:11:51,"all the mercury astronauts that went into space,"
00:11:51,00:11:52,they had all their vital signs
00:11:52,00:11:54,being sussed out the whole way through.
00:11:54,00:11:56,They sort of had all these pads
00:11:56,00:11:58,on them monitoring their heart rates and stuff.
00:11:58,00:11:59,But what I hadn't read before
00:11:59,00:12:03,is they also had a thermometer up the bum for their trips.
00:12:03,00:12:06,"All the mercury astronauts, except for the final one,"
00:12:06,00:12:08,had a thermometer in their bum.
00:12:08,00:12:11,It must have been strange when the aliens got them
00:12:11,00:12:13,and they started adally probing them.
00:12:13,00:12:14,"And they're like, what?"
00:12:14,00:12:15,Someone's been here already.
00:12:15,00:12:20,"Yeah, so that was a thing."
00:12:20,00:12:23,And was it up there the whole time?
00:12:23,00:12:25,"Yeah, because how long were the missions?"
00:12:25,00:12:26,"These weren't long missions, right?"
00:12:26,00:12:28,"They would go up, they would orbit the planets."
00:12:28,00:12:30,"I imagine they felt longer, didn't they?"
00:12:30,00:12:32,How do you know the difference
00:12:32,00:12:35,between a rectal thermometer and an oral thermometer?
00:12:35,00:12:36,"This is very important, I reckon."
00:12:36,00:12:38,This feels like a joke.
00:12:38,00:12:39,It's not a joke.
00:12:39,00:12:42,Feels like it's going to be the smell.
00:12:42,00:12:46,Before it's been used.
00:12:46,00:12:48,How do you work it out before it's been used?
00:12:48,00:12:51,Is it the size of the bulb or something?
00:12:51,00:12:52,"Pretty much right, yeah."
00:12:52,00:12:55,So a rectal thermometer will always have a round bulbous tip.
00:12:55,00:12:58,"And an oral thermometer will have a longer, thin tip."
00:12:58,00:13:01,"And according to the website, I read it said,"
00:13:01,00:13:03,a rectal thermometer should never be used
00:13:03,00:13:04,to take an oral temperature.
00:13:04,00:13:06,And an oral thermometer should never be used
00:13:06,00:13:07,to take a rectal temperature.
00:13:07,00:13:11,But either one can be used to take an armpit temperature.
00:13:11,00:13:13,So it's just a little tip.
00:13:13,00:13:14,The Switzerland temperature.
00:13:14,00:13:18,Is that not because of the danger of contamination?
00:13:18,00:13:19,It does feel like just to be safe.
00:13:19,00:13:21,"They're saying, obviously, don't put something"
00:13:21,00:13:23,that might have been in someone's bum in your mouth.
00:13:23,00:13:27,I think that's quite sensible in that direction.
00:13:27,00:13:28,"And then in the other direction,"
00:13:28,00:13:31,you don't want something spiky going up your bum.
00:13:31,00:13:32,"Yeah, that's true as well."
00:13:32,00:13:34,"And the other thing is, and the very important"
00:13:34,00:13:36,to get the difference between the thermometer
00:13:36,00:13:38,and the barometer when you're putting it up.
00:13:38,00:13:42,A rectal barometer.
00:13:42,00:13:44,Just get the pressure up there.
00:13:44,00:13:49,Your mind is taken completely off
00:13:49,00:13:50,what the weather is going to be doing tomorrow.
00:13:53,00:13:56,I was reading about nature's thermometer.
00:13:56,00:14:01,And there was a scientist called Amos Dolbert
00:14:01,00:14:06,who noticed that crickets would chirp at a certain rate.
00:14:06,00:14:09,"And if you counted the number of clicks that they were doing,"
00:14:09,00:14:13,you could tell what the temperature was.
00:14:13,00:14:16,"And it was useful and unuseful because, A,"
00:14:16,00:14:19,he didn't specify what species of cricket it was.
00:14:19,00:14:21,"So everyone was just like, we've got the readings,"
00:14:21,00:14:23,but we can't find what the hell you're talking about.
00:14:23,00:14:26,They think that it was a snowy tree cricket.
00:14:26,00:14:29,But then they also have noticed
00:14:29,00:14:30,"that there are other field crickets that do it,"
00:14:30,00:14:32,but not all field crickets.
00:14:32,00:14:33,So it's the weirdest thermometer.
00:14:33,00:14:36,You need this one specific cricket in order to tell it.
00:14:36,00:14:38,"And then there's others that might tell you,"
00:14:38,00:14:40,and others that will get it wrong
00:14:40,00:14:41,if they're a different part of the same species.
00:14:41,00:14:42,It's really bizarre.
00:14:42,00:14:45,"I think also, if it goes below a certain temperature,"
00:14:45,00:14:47,they all go to sleep and stop doing anything at all.
00:14:50,00:14:52,But if you find that one species
00:14:52,00:14:54,"that we're not even sure is the right species,"
00:14:54,00:14:56,then you can tell the temperature.
00:14:56,00:14:58,The advantage of the cricket thermometer
00:14:58,00:15:00,"is that crickets are not toxic, unlike mercury."
00:15:00,00:15:04,So you can eat them without any serious harm.
00:15:04,00:15:06,But don't stick them up your bum.
00:15:06,00:15:08,That will not work.
00:15:08,00:15:09,It's hard to hear them chirp.
00:15:20,00:15:22,"OK, it is time for fact number two."
00:15:22,00:15:23,And that is Anna.
00:15:23,00:15:26,My fact this week is that Cold War spy planes
00:15:26,00:15:28,were equipped with rear view mirrors
00:15:28,00:15:29,so that pilots could check
00:15:29,00:15:31,they weren't leaving a trail behind them.
00:15:31,00:15:33,Like a paper trail?
00:15:33,00:15:34,What kind of trail we're talking?
00:15:34,00:15:37,Just dropping clues out the window.
00:15:37,00:15:39,Then I shouldn't have done that.
00:15:39,00:15:41,A con trail.
00:15:41,00:15:43,"Or, as some of you might know them, a chem trail."
00:15:43,00:15:44,Oh my God.
00:15:44,00:15:46,"Wow, straight into the test tube."
00:15:49,00:15:50,I'm going to reverse out of that.
00:15:50,00:15:51,They're just con trails.
00:15:51,00:15:52,They're not chem trails.
00:15:52,00:15:53,"What does the con mean, is it?"
00:15:53,00:15:56,"It's a big old con, spawned by the government."
00:15:56,00:16:01,So con trails are basically that kind of string of white
00:16:01,00:16:03,that comes out of the bottom of a plane
00:16:03,00:16:04,when it's flying.
00:16:04,00:16:07,And it's created when water condenses to form ice crystals
00:16:07,00:16:10,around the tiny particles of kind of soot and dirt and dust
00:16:10,00:16:13,that are being emitted from the aircraft exhausts.
00:16:13,00:16:15,"And major problem for spy planes,"
00:16:15,00:16:18,because often a spy plane is so high up you can't see it.
00:16:18,00:16:20,"But what you can see is this trail,"
00:16:20,00:16:21,"which, if you follow it to the front,"
00:16:21,00:16:23,leads directly to the plane that you need to shoot down.
00:16:23,00:16:28,"And it was known, but they sort of started spotting them"
00:16:28,00:16:29,in the early Second World War.
00:16:29,00:16:32,"And all planes had kind of rear view mirrors,"
00:16:32,00:16:33,"or war planes did,"
00:16:33,00:16:35,"because you needed to see if someone was chasing you,"
00:16:35,00:16:36,or most war planes did.
00:16:36,00:16:39,"And then after that, they didn't."
00:16:39,00:16:41,"But it became apparent in the 1950s,"
00:16:41,00:16:45,"when the Lockheed U2 very famous spy planes were being made,"
00:16:45,00:16:47,"that however high up they were,"
00:16:47,00:16:50,it wasn't going to work in evading detection
00:16:50,00:16:51,"because they were leaving contrails,"
00:16:51,00:16:53,unless they had a way of looking behind them
00:16:53,00:16:55,to see if they were and avoid it.
00:16:55,00:16:57,And so they just have these little mirrors.
00:16:57,00:16:59,So you've got the most high tech plane possibly ever.
00:16:59,00:17:01,"And then on a little pole on its nose,"
00:17:01,00:17:03,you've got a rear view mirror.
00:17:03,00:17:04,"And if you check behind you and you see the trail,"
00:17:04,00:17:06,"you can kind of change your altitude,"
00:17:06,00:17:08,"or change your speed, or reduce the throttle."
00:17:08,00:17:10,And that can reduce the trail.
00:17:10,00:17:13,"Yeah, I think like certain areas of the sky"
00:17:13,00:17:16,"are more susceptible to contrails, aren't they?"
00:17:16,00:17:17,I think because they have a bit more water.
00:17:17,00:17:19,"The moisty bits, isn't it?"
00:17:19,00:17:19,The moisty bits.
00:17:19,00:17:20,The moisty bits.
00:17:20,00:17:22,"Yeah, I didn't want to get too technical, but yes."
00:17:22,00:17:26,"But it changes, it changes a lot, doesn't it?"
00:17:26,00:17:29,It's not like you can't fly between these altitudes.
00:17:29,00:17:30,"It's sometimes, you know,"
00:17:30,00:17:32,it's only a few hundred meters of altitude that changes it.
00:17:32,00:17:35,So it does feel very finessed what they're doing.
00:17:35,00:17:39,"Yeah, those spy planes are, they are incredible."
00:17:39,00:17:40,"Yeah, the U2."
00:17:40,00:17:43,The mirror is literally the least interesting thing about it
00:17:43,00:17:45,when you start looking to it.
00:17:45,00:17:46,Just one minute.
00:17:46,00:17:47,"I mean, your fact is great,"
00:17:47,00:17:51,but what I mean is these planes were astonishing.
00:17:51,00:17:54,So can I give my quick favorite fact about the U2 spy planes?
00:17:54,00:17:58,"It takes two pilots to land a U2 spy plane,"
00:17:58,00:17:59,"one inside the plane,"
00:17:59,00:18:03,and one on the ground in a car chasing the plane.
00:18:03,00:18:06,Because the outfit that you need to wear
00:18:06,00:18:09,"in order to go 70,000 feet into the air,"
00:18:09,00:18:11,"which is how high these planes go,"
00:18:11,00:18:13,it's basically you need to wear astronaut gear.
00:18:13,00:18:15,And it's really hard to turn yourself
00:18:15,00:18:18,and see where you're landing in these planes.
00:18:18,00:18:21,"So as you're coming in to land,"
00:18:21,00:18:23,the other pilot in the car is driving behind you
00:18:23,00:18:25,"and radioing in your position,"
00:18:25,00:18:27,"going, ""You're nearly there, just a bit more, mate."
00:18:27,00:18:29,"Come on, you got better codes than that."""
00:18:29,00:18:32,But literally speaks you into a landing
00:18:32,00:18:35,in a car going 140 miles an hour behind you.
00:18:35,00:18:36,It's unbelievable.
00:18:36,00:18:38,It's extraordinary.
00:18:38,00:18:40,"Basically, it's a plane that's designed to be 70,000 feet up."
00:18:40,00:18:42,It doesn't really like being at ground level.
00:18:42,00:18:44,So it's got two...
00:18:44,00:18:47,"You know, the normal set of plane wheels are in a triangle."
00:18:47,00:18:49,"So you've got the two sets at the back and one at the front,"
00:18:49,00:18:50,"and you come down on the back one,"
00:18:50,00:18:52,"set the front one, it's lovely, jubbly, you're on the ground."
00:18:52,00:18:55,"The U2 plane has got two sets of wheels,"
00:18:55,00:18:58,which are lined up front to back like a bicycle.
00:18:58,00:19:01,"And I mean, it's just a nightmare to land."
00:19:01,00:19:03,You basically have to slow down so much
00:19:03,00:19:04,that it can't fly anymore.
00:19:04,00:19:05,That's how you land it.
00:19:05,00:19:07,"You get to about two feet above the ground,"
00:19:07,00:19:09,"and then you just slow down and slow down and slow down,"
00:19:09,00:19:12,and it will just drop out of the sky onto these double wheels.
00:19:12,00:19:14,"Now, you stall it, don't you?"
00:19:14,00:19:16,You have to stall before you touch the ground.
00:19:16,00:19:16,Every time.
00:19:16,00:19:19,"But then you don't properly stop until the plane tips over,"
00:19:19,00:19:21,effectively crashing.
00:19:21,00:19:24,"Like, basically, you have to crash land"
00:19:24,00:19:24,in order to stop the plane.
00:19:24,00:19:27,And what they have is these steel plates
00:19:27,00:19:29,underneath each of the wingtips.
00:19:29,00:19:32,"So whichever side it keels over onto,"
00:19:32,00:19:35,that's the bit that starts helping them come to a full stop.
00:19:35,00:19:37,"It reminds me, if you know when you're a kid"
00:19:37,00:19:38,"and you're learning to ride a bike,"
00:19:38,00:19:40,"I think that tends to be how you stop at first,"
00:19:40,00:19:43,is you just wait until you fall off one side.
00:19:43,00:19:44,It's like that.
00:19:44,00:19:45,Same with me when skiing.
00:19:45,00:19:46,There you go.
00:19:46,00:19:50,"When you're flying them, you were saying about stalling."
00:19:50,00:19:52,"If you go too slow, then you'll stall."
00:19:52,00:19:54,"But if you go too fast, then the plane falls apart."
00:19:54,00:19:57,And so there's only a 12-miles-an-hour speed window
00:19:57,00:19:58,that you're allowed to fly in.
00:19:58,00:20:00,"And if you go too slow, you crash."
00:20:00,00:20:02,"And if you go too fast, you crash."
00:20:02,00:20:04,So you're basically the whole time
00:20:04,00:20:05,just looking at the speed up.
00:20:05,00:20:08,"It's like, oh, oh, oh."
00:20:08,00:20:09,I think it sometimes--
00:20:09,00:20:11,I think it can be as low as seven sometimes.
00:20:11,00:20:13,"It's called the coffin corner,"
00:20:13,00:20:15,which they've got to start rebranding some of their names
00:20:15,00:20:17,as if you're not scared enough.
00:20:17,00:20:18,"But yeah, it's amazing."
00:20:18,00:20:22,And it's because it flies so high is when you're flying high.
00:20:22,00:20:25,Your max speed is when you break the sound barrier.
00:20:25,00:20:27,"And the sound barrier gets lower and lower,"
00:20:27,00:20:28,"the higher and higher you get, right?"
00:20:28,00:20:29,"So as soon as you get high,"
00:20:29,00:20:30,you're going to break the sound barrier
00:20:30,00:20:32,if you go not that fast.
00:20:32,00:20:34,They're just such gorgeous machines.
00:20:34,00:20:36,And I didn't realize they're so old as well.
00:20:36,00:20:38,The model first flew in 1955.
00:20:38,00:20:41,And I don't think any of those actual planes themselves
00:20:41,00:20:42,are still in the air today.
00:20:42,00:20:45,But the model has been adjusted a bit since then.
00:20:45,00:20:46,But it's being updated now.
00:20:46,00:20:48,It's probably going to be flying for another 30 years.
00:20:48,00:20:49,It's probably going--
00:20:49,00:20:52,This one model of plane is probably going to do 100 years
00:20:52,00:20:54,"in service, which is mad."
00:20:54,00:20:56,Do you know what potentially--
00:20:56,00:20:59,I think we can say the U2 spy plane
00:20:59,00:21:02,is responsible for a very exciting thing
00:21:02,00:21:04,in the world of conspiracy.
00:21:04,00:21:06,Is it the Joshua tree?
00:21:07,00:21:08,Off.
00:21:08,00:21:10,I was hoping we'd get onto the U2 puns.
00:21:10,00:21:13,"It's sitting here saying, you know--"
00:21:13,00:21:15,Who's going to crack first?
00:21:15,00:21:16,Yeah.
00:21:16,00:21:16,No.
00:21:16,00:21:21,Area 51 in the Nevada desert.
00:21:21,00:21:24,It was-- there were some declassified documents
00:21:24,00:21:26,"that came out a number of years ago,"
00:21:26,00:21:28,which showed that they needed a testing space
00:21:28,00:21:31,"for the spy plane, for the U2 spy plane."
00:21:31,00:21:33,So they needed somewhere to officially do that.
00:21:33,00:21:36,And that is what Area 51 was set up for.
00:21:36,00:21:36,Wow.
00:21:36,00:21:39,"Area 51 famously, where the streets have no name."
00:21:39,00:21:41,There you go.
00:21:41,00:21:41,Yeah.
00:21:41,00:21:42,There we go.
00:21:42,00:21:43,That's number two.
00:21:43,00:21:43,Absolutely.
00:21:43,00:21:44,Keep counting.
00:21:44,00:21:47,"Anyway, let's talk about the elevation"
00:21:47,00:21:49,that these planes are flying at.
00:21:49,00:21:50,Jesus Christ.
00:21:50,00:21:52,Pilots often get vertigo.
00:21:52,00:21:54,"It's just for Anna, that was another--"
00:21:54,00:21:55,I didn't get that.
00:21:55,00:21:57,"OK, I only got that that was a joke"
00:21:57,00:21:58,when James said Jesus Christ after it.
00:21:58,00:22:00,"Yeah, did you get the one after that,"
00:22:00,00:22:02,which I didn't say Jesus Christ about?
00:22:02,00:22:03,Was it vertigo?
00:22:03,00:22:04,That seemed like an unusual word to throw in.
00:22:04,00:22:07,"Look, the important point is, when they're flying,"
00:22:07,00:22:09,"whether it's a beautiful day,"
00:22:09,00:22:11,whether they're flying over a city of blinding lights--
00:22:11,00:22:12,Jesus Christ.
00:22:12,00:22:13,Jesus Christ.
00:22:13,00:22:13,Sorry.
00:22:13,00:22:17,I do feel like I have to punctuate these now.
00:22:17,00:22:18,I've got a whole spreadsheet of these.
00:22:18,00:22:23,So they're photographing.
00:22:23,00:22:24,That's what they're for.
00:22:24,00:22:30,"The spy planes, it's for taking photos of territory"
00:22:30,00:22:32,the US is trying to observe.
00:22:32,00:22:34,But they still shoot on film.
00:22:34,00:22:35,And this was reported in 2018.
00:22:35,00:22:37,They're not using digital cameras at all.
00:22:37,00:22:39,They have a lens the size of a dinner plate
00:22:39,00:22:40,on the bottom of the plane.
00:22:40,00:22:44,And then apparently they FedEx the film
00:22:44,00:22:46,back to California to be analyzed.
00:22:46,00:22:49,"And it has rolls of film inside at this plane,"
00:22:49,00:22:50,which are two miles long.
00:22:50,00:22:52,Pretty cool.
00:22:52,00:22:56,"And OK, I had no idea how good the technology was,"
00:22:56,00:23:00,but they photograph all of Afghanistan every month
00:23:00,00:23:00,just to see what's going on.
00:23:00,00:23:02,"What, even the edge?"
00:23:03,00:23:04,Yes.
00:23:04,00:23:05,Sorry.
00:23:05,00:23:06,Jesus Christ.
00:23:06,00:23:06,There we go.
00:23:06,00:23:10,He's the guitarist in the band.
00:23:10,00:23:12,"Oh, OK."
00:23:12,00:23:14,So it's a new angle of puns now.
00:23:14,00:23:15,Nice.
00:23:15,00:23:20,"But the photos are so good, or the cameras are so good,"
00:23:20,00:23:21,that you can differentiate between objects
00:23:21,00:23:24,which are just eight inches apart on the ground.
00:23:24,00:23:24,Wow.
00:23:24,00:23:26,Are we going to talk about chemtrails?
00:23:26,00:23:30,Let's talk about the government trying to poison us.
00:23:30,00:23:33,So chemtrails is the idea that the government
00:23:33,00:23:37,are trying to poison us by putting stuff in contrails.
00:23:37,00:23:39,"Or it might be that they're trying to change the weather,"
00:23:39,00:23:41,"or there's lots of things that they might be doing,"
00:23:41,00:23:43,and they're almost certainly not doing.
00:23:43,00:23:46,But there was a study very recently.
00:23:46,00:23:49,"This was researched at the University of California, Irvine,"
00:23:49,00:23:51,and the Carnegie Institution of Science.
00:23:51,00:23:56,And they asked 77 of the world's leading atmospheric scientists
00:23:56,00:23:59,if they had any evidence that the government
00:23:59,00:24:03,"was spraying stuff out of airplanes, changing the atmosphere,"
00:24:03,00:24:06,"or controlling overpopulation, or controlling food supply,"
00:24:06,00:24:06,or whatever.
00:24:06,00:24:10,76 of them said there is no evidence whatsoever.
00:24:10,00:24:15,And one of them didn't say that there was no evidence.
00:24:15,00:24:18,"And so, obviously, people just jumped on that and went,"
00:24:18,00:24:20,"""Yes, but what about that one guy?"""
00:24:20,00:24:24,"But all he was doing was basically, there was an area"
00:24:24,00:24:28,"which had high levels of barium, which there was currently"
00:24:28,00:24:29,no explanation for.
00:24:29,00:24:32,And he was simply not ruling out the possibility
00:24:32,00:24:35,that someone could have dropped it from an airplane.
00:24:35,00:24:37,"There are a million other things that it could be,"
00:24:37,00:24:40,"but he just, as a scientist, like scientists do,"
00:24:40,00:24:43,"until you have the evidence to rule it out, not ruling it out."
00:24:43,00:24:45,"And that's why he said, you know..."
00:24:45,00:24:47,"Well, it sounds very suspect to me, that's all I'm saying."
00:24:47,00:24:51,"No, the sad thing about chemtrails,"
00:24:51,00:24:55,"the really ironic thing about people who believe in chemtrails,"
00:24:55,00:24:57,"is that I think currently, the predominant belief"
00:24:57,00:24:59,is that the reason the government are apparently
00:24:59,00:25:01,putting these chemicals into contrails
00:25:01,00:25:04,is to mitigate global warming.
00:25:04,00:25:07,"So, people believe that to mitigate global warming,"
00:25:07,00:25:09,chemicals are being sprayed up into the atmosphere
00:25:09,00:25:11,to block the heat from the sun.
00:25:11,00:25:13,"And so, stop the planet warming."
00:25:13,00:25:15,But people think that these chemicals
00:25:15,00:25:17,are very bad for our health and very bad for the environment.
00:25:17,00:25:19,"Therefore, they're being kept a secret."
00:25:19,00:25:23,"However, the truth is that contrails are extremely bad"
00:25:23,00:25:24,for global warming.
00:25:24,00:25:26,"So, I had no idea about this."
00:25:26,00:25:27,But it's so interesting.
00:25:27,00:25:30,"Basically, the kind of cloud they essentially create,"
00:25:30,00:25:32,"like a fake cirrus cloud,"
00:25:32,00:25:34,is one of those really wispy ones.
00:25:34,00:25:37,"And so, what that means is it lets almost all the sunlight through,"
00:25:37,00:25:40,but it traps all the heat underneath.
00:25:40,00:25:42,"And so, it does the opposite of clouds,"
00:25:42,00:25:44,which at least don't let any sunlight through.
00:25:44,00:25:47,"So, like big, big thick clouds don't let sunlight through,"
00:25:47,00:25:48,but they still trap heat.
00:25:48,00:25:50,And there's a study done that showed
00:25:50,00:25:55,that they are the main cause of aviation-based climate change.
00:25:55,00:25:58,"So, when it looked at how much climate change"
00:25:58,00:25:59,"was affected by various things,"
00:25:59,00:26:01,"50% was due to contrails,"
00:26:01,00:26:03,trapping the heat in and letting light through.
00:26:03,00:26:06,"And only 34% was carbon dioxide,"
00:26:06,00:26:07,which has to be qualified
00:26:07,00:26:10,"with the fact that carbon dioxide stays in the atmosphere for ages,"
00:26:10,00:26:13,whereas the contrails are gone as soon as they've gone.
00:26:13,00:26:15,"But even so, I find that amazing."
00:26:15,00:26:16,"They're causing a massive, massive problem."
00:26:16,00:26:17,"Yeah, it's amazing."
00:26:17,00:26:20,And that's why we need to find a way these days
00:26:20,00:26:21,to not have the contrails.
00:26:21,00:26:23,"In the olden days, it was to stop the enemy"
00:26:23,00:26:24,"from seeing where your plane is,"
00:26:24,00:26:27,but now it's trying to help the environment.
00:26:27,00:26:30,"And there is a new system called Satavia,"
00:26:30,00:26:34,which uses AI to work out where in the world all of the...
00:26:34,00:26:38,What did you call them? Moistly areas?
00:26:38,00:26:39,"Dan, I can't remember."
00:26:39,00:26:41,Moisty. The moisty bits.
00:26:41,00:26:43,The high-moistier areas.
00:26:43,00:26:46,And kind of sets up a map and can tell aeroplanes
00:26:46,00:26:49,when to move into areas with low moisture.
00:26:49,00:26:51,"So, they don't have as many contrails."
00:26:51,00:26:53,Just one other thing to say about contrails
00:26:53,00:26:55,is that the reason that they're bad...
00:26:55,00:26:56,"We know the reason they're bad,"
00:26:56,00:26:57,but the reason they're so effective
00:26:57,00:27:01,is that it's not just one plane that's leaving a trail in the sky.
00:27:01,00:27:04,"It's dozens of planes flying the same route, basically."
00:27:04,00:27:06,"And so, rather than just one line in the sky,"
00:27:06,00:27:10,"it's kind of like a massive string vest for the entire planet,"
00:27:10,00:27:12,which is obviously very good at keeping in heat.
00:27:12,00:27:14,Interesting.
00:27:14,00:27:15,"That's the problem, really."
00:27:15,00:27:18,It's amazing because there's so much sky
00:27:18,00:27:22,that you would think that a number of planes
00:27:22,00:27:25,wouldn't be enough contrail to make a difference.
00:27:25,00:27:29,"There's a lot of sky when you look up, you know?"
00:27:29,00:27:31,"Yeah, that's where to look to find the sky."
00:27:31,00:27:34,"I can't deny that. There's a lot of planes, though."
00:27:34,00:27:39,"There are, yeah, but I'm not seeing Andy's string vest"
00:27:39,00:27:40,"in the sky every day, you know?"
00:27:40,00:27:42,"That's what I mean. There's not much of a string vest,"
00:27:42,00:27:43,but it keeps you warm.
00:27:43,00:27:47,Very stringy string vest. Very revealing.
00:27:47,00:27:50,Very sexy string vest.
00:27:51,00:27:54,The other planets are dreadfully jealous of Earth.
00:27:54,00:27:55,Let's see get off.
00:27:55,00:28:05,"Okay, it is time for fact number three, and that is my fact."
00:28:05,00:28:08,"My fact this week is that in 12th century China,"
00:28:08,00:28:11,judges used to wear sunglasses in the courtroom.
00:28:11,00:28:13,Cool judges.
00:28:13,00:28:16,Or because it was sunny in the courtroom.
00:28:16,00:28:18,"Nope. No, they were indoors."
00:28:19,00:28:23,This was a thing that was done in order to hide the emotion
00:28:23,00:28:28,of the judges as they were taking the case on
00:28:28,00:28:30,so that no one could read what they were thinking.
00:28:30,00:28:33,It was just a very clever way of putting on these quartz glasses.
00:28:33,00:28:35,"They're made of quartz, and you'd be like,"
00:28:35,00:28:36,"""What's he thinking? What's he thinking?"""
00:28:36,00:28:39,"""I don't know. He's got his cool sunnies on."""
00:28:39,00:28:40,"So, yeah."
00:28:40,00:28:43,That's cool that it's quartz for the courts.
00:28:43,00:28:45,"Nice, I bet they must have gotten up so good"
00:28:45,00:28:46,in their advertising.
00:28:46,00:28:51,Very true. I'm sure ancient China specifically had the word quartz and quartz.
00:28:51,00:28:52,I think so.
00:28:52,00:29:00,"Yeah, and this is a fact which has led to what I think is an incredibly fun"
00:29:00,00:29:05,set of emails between James and Anna in terms of trying to verify.
00:29:05,00:29:07,Could we quickly talk about that for a second?
00:29:07,00:29:09,"Anna, you've been trying to verify this fact"
00:29:09,00:29:11,"for the last five years, it turns out."
00:29:11,00:29:15,"It's been a long, long slog, and I think it's probably true."
00:29:15,00:29:19,It's cited in - what's the guy called?
00:29:19,00:29:22,"James, then you joined the Getting Very Obsessed bandwagon."
00:29:22,00:29:23,"Kind of overtook me, I think."
00:29:23,00:29:24,Joseph Needham.
00:29:24,00:29:27,Joseph Needham is like the historian of ancient China
00:29:27,00:29:31,"who does cite an original source saying that this is why judges did it, right?"
00:29:31,00:29:32,"Yeah, he does."
00:29:32,00:29:39,He says that someone called Liu Qi wrote in a book called Xia Ji Qi.
00:29:39,00:29:43,"Now, I don't find any evidence that these books or this person exists"
00:29:43,00:29:47,"anywhere else, but it could be because the internet isn't great on 12th century China."
00:29:47,00:29:55,"But he says that they wrote about this guy called Xi Qiang, who was a judge who used them."
00:29:55,00:29:58,"But he does say in a footnote in the bigger version of his book,"
00:29:58,00:30:02,"this piece of information, which I fully believe to be true,"
00:30:02,00:30:06,"comes from a paper on fire pearls and spectacles by Pi,"
00:30:06,00:30:11,"which though interesting, is full of serious and misleading mistakes."
00:30:11,00:30:17,So he's only got it from this one source and he says that the source is unreliable.
00:30:17,00:30:20,But he actually believes it and Anna believes it.
00:30:20,00:30:24,"And if those two believe it, then I've got to say I have to believe it as well."
00:30:24,00:30:24,Yeah.
00:30:24,00:30:26,"Needham's got the instinct, you know?"
00:30:26,00:30:29,He can feel his way around ancient China in a way we can't.
00:30:29,00:30:31,"If he thinks it's true, surely."
00:30:31,00:30:33,"Well, Needham is extraordinary, isn't he?"
00:30:33,00:30:39,"I mean, this guy was the authority on the old science of ancient China."
00:30:39,00:30:44,"Yeah, he was visited by three Chinese students in 1937"
00:30:44,00:30:46,and suddenly got really interested in China.
00:30:46,00:30:50,And he spent three years setting up an office in China
00:30:50,00:30:54,and going up and down the whole of the country trying to find all these different sources.
00:30:54,00:31:00,And his book was described as perhaps the greatest single act of historical
00:31:00,00:31:05,synthesis and intercultural communication ever attempted by one man.
00:31:05,00:31:06,It's incredible.
00:31:06,00:31:10,"And you know all these things where we say, oh, this was invented in China."
00:31:10,00:31:11,This was invented in China.
00:31:11,00:31:15,So many of them are basically down to this one guy's research.
00:31:15,00:31:17,"So if you thought James and I were getting obsessive,"
00:31:17,00:31:20,"he really is the pinnacle, isn't he, of going over the top."
00:31:20,00:31:23,He was a pretty extraordinary guy.
00:31:23,00:31:30,"He, during World War II, he lobbied for UNESCO to basically add the S in UNESCO."
00:31:30,00:31:35,"There's a thing that is said that he is responsible for the S in UNESCO, which is science."
00:31:36,00:31:39,"Yeah. So it was United Nations, educational and cultural."
00:31:39,00:31:42,"So it was UNESCO and then he was like, no, no, come on guys."
00:31:42,00:31:43,"It scans way better as well, doesn't it?"
00:31:43,00:31:45,"Yeah, definitely does."
00:31:45,00:31:49,I guess we should say he's one of the first ever sunglasses.
00:31:49,00:31:56,"And well, I'm sure they're pretty old sunglasses, you know, 800 years, 900 years."
00:31:56,00:32:03,But we think that the first sunglasses were Inuit invention.
00:32:03,00:32:09,And they were kind of goggles to prevent snow blindness made of carved wood or bone.
00:32:09,00:32:14,And it can be really dangerous if you're exposed to ultraviolet light too much.
00:32:14,00:32:17,"And obviously when the sunlight bounces off the snow and into your eyes, that can happen."
00:32:17,00:32:21,"So these are about 2000 years old, perhaps older, perhaps four."
00:32:21,00:32:24,And they've got a strap made from walrus hide.
00:32:24,00:32:28,"Do you remember we did ages ago, we talked about how they made everything out of walrus hide."
00:32:28,00:32:31,"Well, these goggles were no exception."
00:32:31,00:32:33,"And so they're more snow goggles, I guess, than sunglasses."
00:32:33,00:32:36,"But they're a pretty good candidate, I reckon."
00:32:36,00:32:38,There's no glass in them for a start.
00:32:38,00:32:39,"Okay, all right."
00:32:39,00:32:49,"First tinted like glass glass sunglasses, I think, were from the place where you got"
00:32:49,00:32:52,"all the best glass, really, which was Venice."
00:32:52,00:32:56,"I think we've talked about them before, how Venice had this amazing glass industry."
00:32:56,00:32:58,And they made lots of mirrors and things like that.
00:32:59,00:33:04,"These were called Galdoni glasses, and they were made in the late 18th century."
00:33:04,00:33:07,"And they weren't made by Galdoni, but they were popularized by him."
00:33:07,00:33:12,"He was a playwright, and he always wore these particular like tinted glasses."
00:33:12,00:33:14,And everyone kind of copied him.
00:33:14,00:33:17,All the gondoliers would wear them on the canals.
00:33:17,00:33:23,"And the other interesting thing about Carlo Galdoni is he is the person who wrote ""One Man, Two Governors""."
00:33:23,00:33:25,Did he?
00:33:25,00:33:27,"Oh, he did."
00:33:27,00:33:29,James Gordon knows everything to him.
00:33:29,00:33:30,Exactly.
00:33:30,00:33:35,"He wrote an Italian, obviously, play called ""The Servant of Two Masters"","
00:33:35,00:33:37,which was adapted into that play.
00:33:37,00:33:38,Very cool.
00:33:38,00:33:40,"Wow, yeah, it was a huge deal, wasn't it?"
00:33:40,00:33:43,As I suppose you have to be to set an actual trend.
00:33:43,00:33:48,But he moved Italy away from Comedia dell'Arto and into more realism.
00:33:48,00:33:54,"But he did wear green glasses, which is, well, it's kind of comedic."
00:33:54,00:33:57,"But yeah, the lenses tend to be green on those old glasses,"
00:33:57,00:33:59,because that reflects the sun best.
00:33:59,00:34:02,"And they were designed specifically for anyone on the water,"
00:34:02,00:34:04,because of the glare of the water.
00:34:04,00:34:08,"So all gondoliers had these like, um, Wizard of Oz type glasses."
00:34:08,00:34:08,How cool.
00:34:08,00:34:09,So cool.
00:34:09,00:34:11,There was that thing about Plenty of the Elder as well.
00:34:11,00:34:14,"Wasn't there just talking about green tinted glasses,"
00:34:14,00:34:19,"where he said, well, he wrote that the Emperor Nero would watch Gladiator matches through emeralds."
00:34:19,00:34:22,Which it seems really far from.
00:34:22,00:34:24,"Yeah, it sounds like he's never seen an emerald."
00:34:24,00:34:28,"I mean, what would the possible point be?"
00:34:28,00:34:30,"Um, oh, hey, maybe Nero was doing it,"
00:34:30,00:34:34,because I know a physical effect that wearing sunglasses has.
00:34:34,00:34:35,It makes your heart smaller.
00:34:35,00:34:37,Does it?
00:34:37,00:34:38,Not literally.
00:34:38,00:34:41,"Oh, well, it makes you give less money to just giving."
00:34:41,00:34:42,"Yeah, it does."
00:34:42,00:34:45,"Oh, that makes sense, because it sort of removes you from a situation."
00:34:45,00:34:46,This is my guess.
00:34:46,00:34:48,That is the answer.
00:34:48,00:34:52,"Yeah, it makes you a bit more anonymous, not completely anonymous."
00:34:52,00:34:55,"But if you're more anonymous, you are less inhibited,"
00:34:55,00:34:59,"basically, from giving away to your selfish base instincts."
00:34:59,00:35:02,And so they did an experiment at the University of Toronto.
00:35:02,00:35:06,"They got 80 volunteers and they said, right, we're going to give you six dollars,"
00:35:06,00:35:08,not a life-changing sum of money.
00:35:08,00:35:12,"And we want you to split it with someone else who's in the next room, let's say."
00:35:12,00:35:15,"And half of the people they did were just with, you know, nude face,"
00:35:15,00:35:17,and half of them were wearing sunglasses.
00:35:17,00:35:20,"And people who were nude face, panic."
00:35:21,00:35:24,People who were in nude face.
00:35:24,00:35:26,"Oh, actually, they weren't even in nude face."
00:35:26,00:35:28,I think they were wearing normal glasses.
00:35:28,00:35:29,What's going on?
00:35:29,00:35:33,Are these are these all you two songs that I've never heard of?
00:35:33,00:35:37,It sounds like you're really shoehorn in some weird words into these sentences.
00:35:37,00:35:39,"Have you never heard their hit album, Nude Face?"
00:35:39,00:35:41,"Oh, my God, James, it's a revelation."
00:35:41,00:35:43,"He's the bass player, I thought."
00:35:43,00:35:47,"Basically, people who were wearing clear lenses,"
00:35:47,00:35:52,"so more identifiable, they gave away $2.71 of the six dollars they've been given."
00:35:52,00:35:54,"So pretty nearly even Stevens, on average."
00:35:54,00:35:58,People in shades gave away only $1.81.
00:35:58,00:36:01,So they get more than four of the six dollars for themselves.
00:36:01,00:36:04,So that indicates that people are more willing to be a bit more selfish
00:36:04,00:36:07,if they are hidden and anonymous in sunglasses.
00:36:07,00:36:08,Makes total sense.
00:36:08,00:36:13,"You know, when you see like a fashionable, wealthy looking lady wearing huge"
00:36:13,00:36:16,"Audrey Hepburn style sunglasses, you do kind of think, I bet you're a dig."
00:36:17,00:36:20,"Turns out, they are."
00:36:20,00:36:21,"But then when they take the glasses off,"
00:36:21,00:36:23,they magically transform into a nice person again.
00:36:23,00:36:24,Is that right?
00:36:24,00:36:25,Yeah.
00:36:25,00:36:28,"You know, he's not a dick who a lot of people thought was a dick for wearing glasses."
00:36:28,00:36:30,"Bono, from you two."
00:36:30,00:36:31,No.
00:36:31,00:36:37,"Bono, very famously, wears glasses indoors, everywhere, never has them off."
00:36:37,00:36:40,"But it turns out, and he revealed this on the Graham Norton show back in, I think,"
00:36:40,00:36:44,"it was 2017, that he has them on permanently because of a medical condition."
00:36:45,00:36:47,Yeah. So he suffers from glaucoma.
00:36:47,00:36:51,"And it means that his eyes, if there's too much light in them,"
00:36:51,00:36:56,"swell up massively and can have huge problems, loss of eyesight, long term."
00:36:56,00:37:00,And so for someone who plays stadium gigs and is constantly having
00:37:00,00:37:03,"lights flashing in front of him, he could have been blind many, many years ago."
00:37:03,00:37:07,So that's the simple reason why he wears the glasses.
00:37:07,00:37:08,Everyone thought he was being a dick.
00:37:08,00:37:11,"Well, why didn't you tell us all 20, 30 years ago,"
00:37:11,00:37:14,"before you let us all make fools of ourselves, taking a piss out of him?"
00:37:14,00:37:14,Because he's a rock star.
00:37:14,00:37:16,He needs to come across as a dick.
00:37:16,00:37:17,"Oh, yeah, fair enough."
00:37:17,00:37:18,"The cash 20, too."
00:37:18,00:37:21,Does glaucoma come on more as you get older as well?
00:37:21,00:37:25,So maybe he was a dick and he's just now a dick with an excuse.
00:37:25,00:37:27,Wow.
00:37:27,00:37:28,Also going there.
00:37:28,00:37:30,"Possibly, I don't know."
00:37:30,00:37:30,Possibly.
00:37:30,00:37:31,I don't know.
00:37:31,00:37:33,You know Ray Ban.
00:37:33,00:37:34,Yeah.
00:37:34,00:37:41,And Armani and Bulgari and Burberry and Chanel and Dolce and Gabana and Prada and Versace.
00:37:42,00:37:48,And Sunglasses Hut and Oakley and Target Optical and pretty much every kind of sunglasses you can name.
00:37:48,00:37:56,"They're all owned by the same people, by the Luxot Teacher Group, which is an Italian group."
00:37:56,00:38:05,They sell about a billion pairs of lenses and frames every year on all these different brand names.
00:38:05,00:38:08,So some of them they own and some of them they make the sunglasses for the company
00:38:08,00:38:10,that is owned by someone else.
00:38:10,00:38:15,"And this company is owned by a guy called Leonardo Delvecchio,"
00:38:15,00:38:18,who was the son of a vegetable peddler.
00:38:18,00:38:23,And he was sent to an orphanage at age seven because his mother was widowed
00:38:23,00:38:26,and couldn't afford to support all of her children.
00:38:26,00:38:31,"And then when he became a teenager, he started working at a car parts place."
00:38:31,00:38:34,"And then at the age of 14, he put himself through design school."
00:38:34,00:38:36,And now he's the second richest man in the whole of Italy.
00:38:36,00:38:38,Wow.
00:38:38,00:38:38,Wow.
00:38:38,00:38:39,Yeah.
00:38:39,00:38:39,God.
00:38:39,00:38:40,That's extraordinary.
00:38:40,00:38:41,Amazing.
00:38:41,00:38:43,Sounds like they just had a big brainstorm coming up with names.
00:38:43,00:38:45,Couldn't decide to use all of them.
00:38:45,00:38:50,And then why not just sell the one brand?
00:38:50,00:38:51,It's confusing.
00:38:51,00:38:51,One a bit of variety.
00:38:51,00:38:53,I like sunglasses hut best of all.
00:38:53,00:38:54,All right.
00:38:54,00:38:55,"Well, what about Ray?"
00:38:55,00:38:58,Do you know where the name Ray band comes from?
00:38:58,00:39:03,"I assumed there was a Ray involved, as in it was like Max Factor,"
00:39:03,00:39:04,"who was a real person, wasn't he?"
00:39:04,00:39:05,Max Factor was real.
00:39:05,00:39:06,So I assumed that there was a Ray band.
00:39:06,00:39:09,It was called Maximilian Factorovich or something.
00:39:09,00:39:10,"Yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:39:10,00:39:10,That's right.
00:39:10,00:39:14,So I assumed it was Raymond Banneveld or whatever.
00:39:14,00:39:15,"Did you not do what I did, Andy, which is think,"
00:39:15,00:39:18,"I literally went through that exact process thinking,"
00:39:18,00:39:21,"Ray band, I wonder if there's a Ray band,"
00:39:21,00:39:23,"and then you get three seconds into that thought and you go,"
00:39:23,00:39:25,"Oh no, wait, they banish rays."
00:39:25,00:39:27,I never got to that second part of the process.
00:39:27,00:39:28,There you go.
00:39:28,00:39:32,"But they did the, they did those big aviators glasses, didn't they?"
00:39:32,00:39:33,"Was it, was that Ray band?"
00:39:33,00:39:34,I think so.
00:39:34,00:39:34,Yeah.
00:39:34,00:39:34,Yeah.
00:39:34,00:39:35,"Yeah, invented the aviators."
00:39:35,00:39:38,They were designed by a guy called John McCready.
00:39:38,00:39:43,"And John McCready, as well as designing these aviator sunglasses,"
00:39:43,00:39:48,he was the first person to test fly a crop duster airplane.
00:39:48,00:39:54,"He set three altitude records flying up to 35,000 feet-ish,"
00:39:54,00:39:56,the first person to do that.
00:39:56,00:40:01,"He set the world endurance record of flying for over 35 hours,"
00:40:01,00:40:02,35 hours and 18 minutes.
00:40:02,00:40:07,He made the first non-stop coast-to-coast flight across America.
00:40:07,00:40:12,And he did the first aircraft engine repair while it was flying.
00:40:12,00:40:14,So replaying an engine while the plane was flying.
00:40:14,00:40:15,"Oh, wow."
00:40:15,00:40:20,And he became the first ever pilot to bail out of an aircraft at night.
00:40:20,00:40:24,He did all those things and the invented or designed the aviator sunglasses.
00:40:24,00:40:26,It's amazing.
00:40:26,00:40:31,"There's such a terrifying story about when he did break the altitude record,"
00:40:31,00:40:33,which is that his friend was actually trying to break it.
00:40:33,00:40:35,A guy called Shorty Schroeder.
00:40:35,00:40:36,This was in 1920.
00:40:36,00:40:42,"And this guy went up and at the time before they had your aviator sunglasses,"
00:40:42,00:40:43,they wore goggles.
00:40:43,00:40:45,"And because they were going up so high and it was incredibly cold,"
00:40:45,00:40:51,"like minus 50 degrees, they wore goggles with fur lining."
00:40:51,00:40:53,"And if your eye was even a split second exposed,"
00:40:53,00:40:56,then you're absolutely buggered because it's far too cold for an eye to survive.
00:40:56,00:41:00,So this guy Shorty went up and his goggles completely fogged up
00:41:00,00:41:01,so he couldn't see a thing.
00:41:01,00:41:04,And he had no choice except to rip them off his face so he could see.
00:41:04,00:41:06,"And within moments, his vision went really blurred"
00:41:06,00:41:09,and his eyes completely froze over.
00:41:09,00:41:11,So my God.
00:41:11,00:41:13,All the liquid in his eyes froze.
00:41:13,00:41:15,Somehow his eyeballs frozen.
00:41:15,00:41:17,"He managed to land and it was John McReady,"
00:41:17,00:41:19,"his friend who pulled him out of the cockpit and said,"
00:41:19,00:41:23,"""All right, mate. Nice try. Bad luck about the goggles."""
00:41:23,00:41:24,Then he broke the record.
00:41:24,00:41:27,Then he went and found the sunglasses manufacturers and went right.
00:41:27,00:41:28,We better make some better glasses.
00:41:28,00:41:29,That's amazing.
00:41:29,00:41:33,"Because I was just thinking, like quite often when I talk to people,"
00:41:33,00:41:35,their eyes just kind of glaze over.
00:41:35,00:41:38,And I wonder if it's due to the temperature perhaps.
00:41:38,00:41:39,"That's what it is, James."
00:41:39,00:41:42,"It's the lofty, lofty conversation you have, James."
00:41:42,00:41:44,"It simulates the altitude of 35,000 feet."
00:41:44,00:41:45,It's incredible.
00:41:45,00:41:51,"You know, do you know progressive lenses in glasses?"
00:41:51,00:41:57,"What these are, you can have bifocals where half of them are for short-sighted"
00:41:57,00:41:58,and half of them are for long-sighted.
00:41:58,00:42:00,And you look in different parts of your glasses
00:42:00,00:42:04,"and you can, depending on what you're looking at, a progressive lens."
00:42:04,00:42:08,"It still has your short-sighted bits and your long-sighted bits,"
00:42:08,00:42:10,but they're kind of blended into each other.
00:42:10,00:42:12,So you're never jumping from one to the other.
00:42:12,00:42:17,And the first US patent for one of these was by a woman called Dr. Estelle Glancy.
00:42:17,00:42:20,"And she, as well as invented that."
00:42:20,00:42:23,"Oh, yeah, Glancy."
00:42:23,00:42:24,I thought that was the whole point.
00:42:24,00:42:25,"Yeah, I thought that was the point."
00:42:25,00:42:26,That's the point.
00:42:26,00:42:28,You know what?
00:42:28,00:42:32,"I mean, so many of my facts are just this person's got a funny name."
00:42:32,00:42:34,I do see why you thought that was the end of it.
00:42:34,00:42:38,But she also invented the first lens testing machine.
00:42:38,00:42:41,"And that is still used in most opticians today, her invention."
00:42:41,00:42:47,"And from 1918 to 1950, when she worked in the industry,"
00:42:47,00:42:54,she was the only female lens designer in the whole world for 32 years.
00:42:54,00:42:55,She was the only one.
00:42:55,00:42:57,Everyone else who did it was a man.
00:42:57,00:43:03,"And on the website for Zeiss, who's like a kind of an optical company,"
00:43:03,00:43:06,"they said that women have faced a glass ceiling in many fields,"
00:43:06,00:43:10,but the glass ceiling in glasses may have been the toughest to break through.
00:43:10,00:43:11,Brilliant.
00:43:11,00:43:12,"There's a great line, isn't there?"
00:43:12,00:43:16,But now women make up more than 76% of opticians in the US.
00:43:16,00:43:18,"So it's gotten better, certainly."
00:43:18,00:43:19,We've made it.
00:43:19,00:43:20,I'm really cool.
00:43:20,00:43:22,Progressive lens sounds like a lens.
00:43:22,00:43:24,That only lets you read The Guardian and the New Statesman or something.
00:43:24,00:43:26,"Yeah, that's nice."
00:43:26,00:43:27,I've won Tiny.
00:43:27,00:43:31,"This just made me laugh because it's to do with one of my favorite movies, Contact."
00:43:31,00:43:35,"Contact the movie, Jodie Foster."
00:43:35,00:43:39,"Almost got a really bizarre review from this guy called Anthony Lane,"
00:43:39,00:43:44,"who is an American reviewer, because he was running really late to the cinema."
00:43:44,00:43:48,"And when he ran in and sat down, he forgot to take his sunglasses off."
00:43:48,00:43:51,So he watched the first three quarters of an hour with the glasses on.
00:43:51,00:43:56,"And the notes that he looked back on were notes going, ""Very gloomy this movie."
00:43:56,00:43:59,Odd noir look for sci-fi.
00:43:59,00:44:02,"Creepy shadows in the outdoor seats."""
00:44:02,00:44:06,And then suddenly realized he had his sunnies on.
00:44:06,00:44:08,He was wearing contact lenses.
00:44:08,00:44:10,Very good.
00:44:10,00:44:12,"Oh, okay."
00:44:12,00:44:15,Got to move it on.
00:44:15,00:44:21,"So I read a fun story from 2017 about sunglasses, specifically that police caught a man"
00:44:21,00:44:26,on his phone at the wheel because he took a selfie of himself of his face.
00:44:26,00:44:28,"He's wearing sunglasses and the selfie says something like,"
00:44:28,00:44:31,"""Single today, married tomorrow, scary times."""
00:44:31,00:44:33,Something really cool like that.
00:44:33,00:44:35,And he tweeted this.
00:44:35,00:44:39,"And the police in his area spotted that in the photograph,"
00:44:39,00:44:43,there was the reflection in his sunglasses of his other hand on the wheel of a car
00:44:43,00:44:46,and the reflection of the view through the windscreen showing that he was mid-driving
00:44:46,00:44:47,on a dual carriageway.
00:44:49,00:44:53,"Twisted at him, said, ""We've got a wedding present for you and it's a Â£200 fine"
00:44:53,00:44:54,"and six points on your license."""
00:44:54,00:44:56,They tweeted it back.
00:44:56,00:44:58,They tweeted him that and then he deleted his Twitter account.
00:44:58,00:44:58,So that's bad.
00:44:58,00:45:01,"No one comes across well in that story, do they?"
00:45:01,00:45:03,I don't think the police come across that well.
00:45:03,00:45:06,And obviously he's driving while selfying.
00:45:06,00:45:07,So I just think...
00:45:07,00:45:09,"What you think of the police, that was a little bit."
00:45:09,00:45:10,"Don't do it over Twitter, guys."
00:45:10,00:45:12,Don't do it over Twitter.
00:45:12,00:45:15,"Yeah, kick the door in like traditional, you know."
00:45:15,00:45:27,"Okay, it is time for our final fact of the show and that is James."
00:45:27,00:45:31,"Okay, my fact this week is that there is a species of rabbit that can't hop."
00:45:31,00:45:36,"So if it wants to go fast, it walks on its hands with its legs in the air."
00:45:36,00:45:41,"Oh, I love these guys."
00:45:41,00:45:42,They're so cute.
00:45:44,00:45:46,You might have seen them online in the last couple of weeks.
00:45:46,00:45:49,They've done a mini viral thing on the internet.
00:45:49,00:45:52,Hopefully not too viral that some of you won't have heard of it.
00:45:52,00:45:59,But this is a species of rabbit called Sauter d'Alfort or the Alfort Jumper.
00:45:59,00:46:01,And they're a French species of rabbit.
00:46:01,00:46:06,"And very recently, the reason they've got in the news is because there is a guy"
00:46:06,00:46:10,called Leif Anderson and his team at Uppsala University in Sweden.
00:46:10,00:46:16,And they have worked out what the gene is that makes it unable to hop like normal rabbits.
00:46:16,00:46:19,"So it's kind of a genetic problem they've got, isn't it?"
00:46:19,00:46:20,It's sort of quirky.
00:46:20,00:46:23,"Yeah, do they get preyed on more, I wonder?"
00:46:23,00:46:26,"Because they can't go that fast, maybe?"
00:46:26,00:46:29,They tend to not live in the wild very much.
00:46:29,00:46:34,"So the first we found out about them, there was a French vet called Etienne Leta."
00:46:34,00:46:39,And he was studying these rabbits that were unable to jump properly.
00:46:40,00:46:44,And he was breeding rabbits at the time and he'd bred a few together.
00:46:44,00:46:47,"And this strain had come out, which did this weird thing."
00:46:47,00:46:51,He said that they moved exactly like a human tightrope walker walks on his hands.
00:46:51,00:46:55,So he kind of saw that association then.
00:46:55,00:46:57,"But the thing is, this is a very much recessive gene."
00:46:57,00:47:04,So I think some might have escaped and some completely healthy ones have mated.
00:47:04,00:47:07,And now you get some of them in the wild that do this.
00:47:07,00:47:10,"But again, they won't really last very long, I don't think."
00:47:10,00:47:13,"If they did that, it's really impressive, isn't it?"
00:47:13,00:47:15,"Yeah, it's kind of very cool seeing them handstand the way along."
00:47:15,00:47:17,It's kind of awesome.
00:47:17,00:47:18,"Oh, it's so wicked."
00:47:18,00:47:18,Yeah.
00:47:18,00:47:20,"And actually, he's quite interested in Etienne Leta."
00:47:20,00:47:26,"His father, Klebert Leta, was the first person to perform"
00:47:26,00:47:28,artificial insemination of a horse in France.
00:47:28,00:47:34,"Etienne was the first, did the first public demonstration"
00:47:34,00:47:36,of insemination of a cow in France.
00:47:37,00:47:39,Is that a step up or a step down?
00:47:39,00:47:40,I can't remember.
00:47:40,00:47:43,"Public, that's kind of, it's more showbiz, isn't it?"
00:47:43,00:47:43,It is.
00:47:43,00:47:47,"Yeah, he took his father's ponchant for insemination"
00:47:47,00:47:49,and he made himself a star.
00:47:49,00:47:51,Gave it a bit of the old razzle dazzle.
00:47:51,00:47:52,Yeah.
00:47:52,00:47:55,I wonder if that's a hard show to get people to come to.
00:47:55,00:47:57,"You know in Edinburgh, when you're walking through and everyone says,"
00:47:57,00:48:00,"""Come, we've got naked Shakespeare,"" or, you know, ""Come to..."""
00:48:00,00:48:02,"""Come one, come all!"""
00:48:05,00:48:08,"Does anyone, you guys might not know this,"
00:48:08,00:48:11,"but have you ever heard of the song, ""Run, Rabbit, Run""?"
00:48:11,00:48:12,"Oh, yeah."
00:48:12,00:48:15,"""Run, Rabbit, Run, Rabbit, Run, Run, Run, Run."""
00:48:15,00:48:18,"""Gum's a farmer with his gum, gum, gum."""
00:48:18,00:48:21,"""Bang, bang, bang, goes the farmer's gum."""
00:48:21,00:48:22,"So, ""Run, run."""
00:48:22,00:48:22,"Sorry, go on."
00:48:22,00:48:23,What were you going to say about it?
00:48:23,00:48:26,Is that a nursery rhyme or is that a big hit in the UK?
00:48:26,00:48:28,It was a big hit back in the day.
00:48:28,00:48:30,Flanagan and Alan sang it.
00:48:30,00:48:32,It was written by Noel Gay.
00:48:32,00:48:35,And it became a patriotic song
00:48:35,00:48:40,"in World War II, where they sang ""Run, Adolf, Run, Adolf, Run, Run, Run"" instead."
00:48:40,00:48:44,And the reason that they got that song for World War II
00:48:44,00:48:47,is because there was a picture that was in all the newspapers
00:48:47,00:48:50,of this big sort of crater where a bum had landed
00:48:50,00:48:53,"and someone was holding two rabbits and said,"
00:48:53,00:48:55,"""Ha, ha, Hitler, you bummed us,"
00:48:55,00:48:57,"but all you managed to kill was these two rabbits."""
00:48:57,00:49:00,"But actually, that was a setup, that picture."
00:49:00,00:49:04,And the rabbits had been bought by nearby butchers
00:49:04,00:49:07,and they'd gone to the hole in the ground and held them up.
00:49:07,00:49:10,And it was basically a bit of propaganda.
00:49:10,00:49:13,"But then, as a result, this ""Run, Rabbit, Run"" song"
00:49:13,00:49:15,became massive during World War II.
00:49:15,00:49:15,How interesting.
00:49:15,00:49:18,Because I have seen that as a fact around the internet
00:49:18,00:49:21,that the first casualty of World War II to a bum was a rabbit.
00:49:21,00:49:22,I think it was.
00:49:22,00:49:23,And it was a specific incident.
00:49:23,00:49:24,"Or is this a different incident, Anna?"
00:49:24,00:49:25,"No, no, it's the same incident."
00:49:25,00:49:29,"It's kind of propaganda, but it's just to tell a true story."
00:49:29,00:49:31,"Because I believe, bizarrely, the first bum dropped"
00:49:31,00:49:32,"was on the Shetland Islands,"
00:49:32,00:49:36,because it was the Germans trying to get some of the boats
00:49:36,00:49:38,in an inlet around the Shetland.
00:49:38,00:49:41,"And what happened was, a few landed on the land"
00:49:41,00:49:43,and one of them killed a rabbit.
00:49:43,00:49:44,"Like, all the locals were like,"
00:49:44,00:49:47,"""Oh, God, this is a big crater, this poor rabbit's dead."""
00:49:47,00:49:49,And there was a photographer who lived on the island
00:49:49,00:49:52,"who was like, ""Oh, brilliant, I'm going to go and photograph that."""
00:49:52,00:49:55,But he's a smart cookie and has an eye for a good bit of press.
00:49:55,00:49:57,And so he went to the butcher on the way
00:49:57,00:49:59,"to buy some rabbits to hold up,"
00:49:59,00:50:00,because he knew that that rabbit
00:50:00,00:50:01,was going to be blown to smithereens.
00:50:01,00:50:03,"You know what you're saying, Anna, but I don't think you can..."
00:50:03,00:50:04,And then he said that that's why.
00:50:04,00:50:06,I don't think you can claim your Pulitzer Prize
00:50:06,00:50:10,"if you're going buying crops for your war photos, can you?"
00:50:10,00:50:11,Yeah.
00:50:11,00:50:13,"Oh, come on."
00:50:13,00:50:17,It was a bit of dramatic artistic license in the face of...
00:50:17,00:50:20,Because you can't hold up the sort of butchered remains.
00:50:20,00:50:21,"You have to have some rabbits, no."
00:50:21,00:50:21,Yeah.
00:50:21,00:50:23,So was there any...
00:50:23,00:50:26,Do we have a photo that's sort of like in the archives
00:50:26,00:50:27,of the butchered rabbit?
00:50:27,00:50:29,"Or did someone did some farm ago,"
00:50:29,00:50:32,"""I'm down one rabbit. It must have landed on that."""
00:50:32,00:50:33,That's a good point.
00:50:33,00:50:34,It's a big claim.
00:50:34,00:50:35,"Did it land on the hutch,"
00:50:35,00:50:37,or was it just a loose rabbit in a field?
00:50:37,00:50:40,And we presume that it lost its life in the...
00:50:40,00:50:42,"But also, starting with the Shetlands,"
00:50:42,00:50:44,feels like a very toe in the water strategy
00:50:44,00:50:45,for your bobbin campaign.
00:50:45,00:50:49,"I have a plain and rabbit-related fact,"
00:50:49,00:50:50,"which is that in 2017,"
00:50:50,00:50:52,a plane had to make an emergency landing
00:50:52,00:50:54,that was flying between Melbourne and Brisbane.
00:50:54,00:50:55,It had to make an emergency landing
00:50:55,00:50:58,after it hit an eagle and a rabbit at the same time.
00:50:58,00:51:00,"Oh, wow."
00:51:00,00:51:02,"It was the eagle that had caught the rabbit,"
00:51:02,00:51:04,"and it was flying up into the air,"
00:51:04,00:51:05,and it failed to notice.
00:51:05,00:51:06,It was so intent on its lunch
00:51:06,00:51:09,that it failed to notice the plane bearing down on it.
00:51:09,00:51:10,Same questions about that.
00:51:10,00:51:13,"You're flying your plane,"
00:51:13,00:51:15,"and I guess you could see an eagle,"
00:51:15,00:51:16,but you're so fast
00:51:16,00:51:18,"that you're going to collide really quick, right?"
00:51:18,00:51:20,How do we know there was a rabbit there?
00:51:20,00:51:22,It's such a good question.
00:51:22,00:51:24,I just don't see how the pilot could have seen.
00:51:24,00:51:27,I don't think we're relying on the pilot's testimony.
00:51:27,00:51:29,I think they must have found some fur in the engine.
00:51:29,00:51:32,Do you think someone went to the Butchers
00:51:32,00:51:33,after the plane landed?
00:51:33,00:51:37,There's one Butcher who's doing very well.
00:51:37,00:51:41,I have dodgy journalists.
00:51:41,00:51:46,Do you know that the big reveal of the Simpsons
00:51:46,00:51:49,was meant to be that Marge Simpson was a massive rabbit?
00:51:49,00:51:51,What are you talking about?
00:51:51,00:51:54,"Yeah, this is a thing Matt Groening really wanted to do,"
00:51:54,00:51:58,"which was he had a previous comic strip called Life in Hell,"
00:51:58,00:52:00,which was about a bunch of rabbits.
00:52:00,00:52:03,"Yeah, and it was a very popular comic strip for him,"
00:52:03,00:52:07,and then the Simpsons became the big thing that he did.
00:52:07,00:52:10,"But his big idea, which he pitched in a few meetings,"
00:52:10,00:52:14,was that underneath the giant blue hair
00:52:14,00:52:16,that would one day get wet would come down
00:52:16,00:52:20,"and revealed underneath would be two giant bunny rabbit ears,"
00:52:20,00:52:23,and we would be shown that that universe was connected
00:52:23,00:52:25,to the Life is Hell universe.
00:52:25,00:52:27,And everyone told he was mad and not to do it
00:52:27,00:52:28,because he was going to do an episode.
00:52:28,00:52:30,Then he thought that's the long game.
00:52:30,00:52:32,We could do this as the final reveal.
00:52:32,00:52:34,So he was a massive rabbit all along.
00:52:34,00:52:35,Still waiting.
00:52:35,00:52:36,We're still waiting for that final reveal.
00:52:36,00:52:37,They talked about it.
00:52:37,00:52:40,He said in a DVD commentary that it's an old idea.
00:52:40,00:52:43,"However, there was a video game that was released of the Simpsons"
00:52:43,00:52:46,"where in it, Marge gets electrocuted."
00:52:46,00:52:48,And you know that classic cartoon thing of electrocution
00:52:48,00:52:52,where you see the skeleton come through or the body underneath?
00:52:52,00:52:54,"In it, when she gets electrocuted,"
00:52:54,00:52:57,it sort of shows she has massive bunny rabbit ears.
00:52:57,00:53:01,"So for one instance, she was in one part of the Simpsons universe."
00:53:01,00:53:02,She is a giant rabbit.
00:53:02,00:53:04,"And that is a classic Easter egg, isn't it?"
00:53:04,00:53:06,Brilliant.
00:53:06,00:53:06,Lovely.
00:53:06,00:53:09,I know my tech terms.
00:53:09,00:53:12,Rabbits are very stoic.
00:53:12,00:53:16,"Didn't know this, but yeah."
00:53:16,00:53:20,"So Rabbits, if they're really ill, they don't let you know."
00:53:20,00:53:22,"So many rabbit owners, when their rabbits died,"
00:53:22,00:53:24,"they're like, it just came out of nowhere."
00:53:24,00:53:25,They weren't even sick.
00:53:25,00:53:27,"But actually, they pretend to be healthy."
00:53:27,00:53:30,"They're like the opposite of possums, even if they're sick."
00:53:30,00:53:32,And that's to just deflect attention from predators.
00:53:32,00:53:34,"Because if a predator sees a sick rabbit, it thinks,"
00:53:34,00:53:36,I'm going to catch that one.
00:53:36,00:53:36,Interesting.
00:53:36,00:53:39,And so often they will just drop dead.
00:53:39,00:53:41,But aren't they terrified of us?
00:53:41,00:53:42,Aren't they terrified of human owners?
00:53:42,00:53:44,I read a thing saying that when you pick a rabbit up
00:53:44,00:53:45,"and it's all still and quiet,"
00:53:45,00:53:48,it's just desperately hoping that you go away.
00:53:48,00:53:49,"Yeah, they're rarely still and quiet."
00:53:49,00:53:50,"If you've ever had a pet rabbit,"
00:53:50,00:53:52,they will scratch your eyes out.
00:53:52,00:53:53,Right.
00:53:53,00:53:54,Oh.
00:53:54,00:53:54,They're bad pets.
00:53:54,00:53:57,They've got a pet docile and sort of calm.
00:53:57,00:54:00,"No, but I think maybe your parents got a dead rabbit"
00:54:00,00:54:02,from a local butcher and said it was a pet.
00:54:02,00:54:05,A bloody butcher.
00:54:05,00:54:11,You know the rabbits that were used in the Teletubbies show?
00:54:11,00:54:16,"They had to be so enormous because they were,"
00:54:16,00:54:17,because the Teletubbies were huge.
00:54:17,00:54:18,Right.
00:54:18,00:54:21,"And it was like in a, they lived in a big field"
00:54:21,00:54:23,and there was lots of rabbits jumping around all the time.
00:54:23,00:54:23,Was that so?
00:54:23,00:54:24,Exactly.
00:54:24,00:54:24,Yeah.
00:54:24,00:54:26,"And they were, they were Flemish giants,"
00:54:26,00:54:28,which I think are the largest rabbits on the planet.
00:54:28,00:54:30,Or they're almost the largest breed that you can get
00:54:30,00:54:32,"because the Teletubbies costumes, which are so massive."
00:54:32,00:54:34,"Anyway, this, I got,"
00:54:34,00:54:37,I fell into a bit of a rabbit hole reading about these guys.
00:54:37,00:54:39,"And the problem was, firstly,"
00:54:39,00:54:42,the rabbits were always doing what rabbits do
00:54:42,00:54:43,and trying to breed with each other.
00:54:43,00:54:44,So they had to keep doing retakes
00:54:44,00:54:46,because there would be a pair of rabbits
00:54:46,00:54:47,in the background mating.
00:54:48,00:54:50,"And that, anyway, that's not really relevant"
00:54:50,00:54:52,"because the main fact I wanted to say,"
00:54:52,00:54:53,I didn't know this.
00:54:53,00:54:56,The Teletubby costumes were so enormous and ungainly
00:54:56,00:54:58,and difficult to move around in
00:54:58,00:55:01,that they had to have seats inside them
00:55:01,00:55:03,so the actors could sit down between takes.
00:55:03,00:55:03,No way.
00:55:03,00:55:05,Oh my God.
00:55:05,00:55:06,"So if you see a Teletubby standing up,"
00:55:06,00:55:08,you don't know whether the person inside
