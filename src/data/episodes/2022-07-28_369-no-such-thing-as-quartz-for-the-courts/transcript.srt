00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:18,400
 Hello and welcome to another episode of No Such Thing as a Fish,

3
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:23,280
 a weekly podcast coming to you from four undisclosed locations in the UK.

4
00:00:23,280 --> 00:00:24,560
 My name is Dan Schreiber.

5
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:29,280
 I'm sitting here with Anna Tyshinski, Andrew Hunter Murray, and James Harkin.

6
00:00:29,280 --> 00:00:33,200
 And once again, we have gathered round the microphones with our four favorite facts

7
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:38,000
 from the last seven days, and in no particular order, here we go.

8
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:39,760
 Starting with you, Andy.

9
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:45,440
 My fact is that the doctor who invented the first decent thermometer suitable for rectal use

10
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:47,120
 was named Thomas Orbutt.

11
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:51,680
 It's the ultimate in nominative determinism, isn't it?

12
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:52,160
 It is.

13
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:58,320
 Yeah, it's just a cheap joke at the expense of a brilliant doctor who has done a lot more

14
00:00:58,320 --> 00:00:59,440
 for the world than I ever will.

15
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:04,640
 Do you think I was trying to look into whether or not he got any sort of

16
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:05,760
 shtick for it at the time?

17
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:08,000
 If anyone made any jokes about it, couldn't see anything.

18
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,760
 It was just pure respect for the man.

19
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:11,920
 Wow, missing a trick in those days, weren't they?

20
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:12,400
 Idiots.

21
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:13,680
 When was this?

22
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:15,040
 It was like ten of the...

23
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:16,800
 It was the 1860s.

24
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:18,960
 He invented it in 1866, I think.

25
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:20,960
 He worked with the manufacturers on the design,

26
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:25,600
 and then he wrote an essay about it in 1868 in which he sort of described his making a bit.

27
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:29,040
 It's important to say he himself was an armpit man.

28
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:31,440
 What?

29
00:01:31,440 --> 00:01:33,920
 Why do we need to know about his kinks?

30
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:37,760
 He said it's better to put...

31
00:01:37,760 --> 00:01:40,800
 Because basically it was the first decent thermometer for use on patients.

32
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:43,920
 All the ones before that took about 20 minutes to get a good reading,

33
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:47,440
 and some of them were a foot long, and some of them were even longer than that.

34
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:49,760
 I mean, it was the Wild West out there.

35
00:01:49,760 --> 00:01:55,360
 He created a much more reliable one, which was shorter and took very few minutes to get a reading,

36
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:57,840
 but he himself said, look, the armpit is better.

37
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:02,160
 And he wrote this essay saying that if patients allow single rectal examinations,

38
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:06,000
 which is doubtful, they will certainly rebel against their frequent repetition.

39
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,440
 And this is as true of the coarser as the more sensitive natures.

40
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:12,800
 For in the former class of patients, the coarser variety,

41
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:15,600
 my assistants and myself have by such examinations,

42
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:18,160
 rectal examinations, excited comments,

43
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:21,040
 the narration of which would not tend to edification.

44
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:22,240
 Wow.

45
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:25,200
 What does he mean by coarser?

46
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:28,160
 Does he mean people who seem like they're really hard?

47
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:29,120
 Socially, Rafa.

48
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:32,480
 Yeah, I mean, he was a doctor in Leeds, wasn't he?

49
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:34,320
 So you can imagine his Yorkshire.

50
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:37,120
 Yeah, put in that thermometer anywhere near my ass.

51
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:44,880
 But he was a proper, good, famous doctor, wasn't he, in Leeds?

52
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:48,080
 His mother was a friend of the Brontes.

53
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:51,520
 He himself was a friend of George Elliott.

54
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:54,720
 And apparently, a character, I haven't read Middlemarch,

55
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:57,280
 but I know Anna and Andy at least haven't done my half as well.

56
00:02:57,280 --> 00:03:02,320
 But a character called Lidgate in Middlemarch, supposedly based on him, supposedly.

57
00:03:02,320 --> 00:03:04,320
 That makes sense. He is the doctor character.

58
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:08,160
 I wouldn't surprise if it was Dorothea.

59
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:12,080
 His father was a rector.

60
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:16,480
 Father was a rector and he was a rectal prober.

61
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:20,640
 Well, his father was the rector of a place in Suffolk called

62
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:22,160
 the back cum bulge.

63
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:25,200
 No, what?

64
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:29,440
 That's a great link.

65
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:30,880
 Really? It's so good.

66
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:34,320
 Well, I love the literary links, as you were saying, James, with George Elliott.

67
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:38,240
 They were really good friends and she wrote about him a lot.

68
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:41,440
 And that we have one quote particular, which she says,

69
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:44,800
 "A good, clever, graceful man enough to enable one to be cheerful

70
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:47,200
 under the horrible smoke of ugly Leeds."

71
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:50,560
 I think they went then.

72
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:53,840
 Yeah, in fairness, that was a trip that George Elliott

73
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:56,720
 and her friend were making from Leeds to Bolton.

74
00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:58,320
 And if you're going to go to Bolton,

75
00:03:58,320 --> 00:03:59,920
 anywhere is going to look ugly, isn't it?

76
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:02,880
 Was it actually?

77
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:03,680
 Yeah.

78
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:06,240
 You must have been so excited by that.

79
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:08,800
 Did she give then a bucolic description of Bolton?

80
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:10,720
 I couldn't. I looked.

81
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:12,240
 I must admit, I looked.

82
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:15,520
 And I was more excited of finding out that she went to Bolton

83
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:18,960
 than I was about finding out his dad was from the back cum bulge.

84
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:20,720
 That's how excited I was.

85
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:24,800
 Wow, when something excites you more than a rude name,

86
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:25,840
 you know you're a business.

87
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:31,280
 Yeah, he was kind of had an unrivaled reputation

88
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:32,480
 in that area, I think.

89
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:35,440
 And then he quit doctoring in the late '80s

90
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:38,160
 and became commissioner for lunacy

91
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:40,480
 and kind of looked at mental health problems.

92
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:42,960
 And the reason that he left, no one was quite sure why he left,

93
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:46,560
 but they think it might be because his uncle was very badly treated.

94
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:48,800
 His uncle was called Henry All Butt.

95
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:53,440
 And he had written a book called The Wife's Handbook in 1885,

96
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:56,080
 which described contraceptive methods for women.

97
00:04:56,080 --> 00:05:00,640
 And the people at the time thought that this should not be allowed,

98
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:02,400
 especially for working-class women.

99
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:05,280
 And he was struck off from the medical register in 1887

100
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:07,280
 because he'd written this book about contraception.

101
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:11,440
 He said, "Knowledge may be all right for the rich lady

102
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:13,520
 who can afford to buy a guinea medical book

103
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:15,280
 and pay a big fee to a doctor,

104
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:17,520
 but it is an offence of an infamous character

105
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:20,160
 for a physician to write and sell a book at sixpence,

106
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:22,400
 showing the poor how to better their hard lot."

107
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:24,240
 That is really interesting.

108
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:25,280
 God, what a family.

109
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:26,720
 I know, amazing, eh?

110
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:27,680
 Yeah.

111
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:29,440
 Apparently, not a good sense of humour, though.

112
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:31,680
 On the downside,

113
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:33,600
 Paul calling to one biography friends called him

114
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:36,000
 "caughtly and aristocratic in demeanour,

115
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,160
 gracious of mind and bearing,

116
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:40,400
 but serious and somewhat humorless."

117
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:43,840
 So he couldn't have seen the comedy in his own name.

118
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:44,400
 So sad.

119
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:46,240
 Oh, that is tragic, yeah.

120
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:49,680
 The first person to decide that temperature

121
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:52,720
 in a healthy person is always going to be about the same,

122
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:55,520
 and that if you have a high or low temperature,

123
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:57,280
 it could be due to your disease,

124
00:05:57,280 --> 00:05:59,200
 was a guy called Carl Wunderlich.

125
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:02,240
 Wow.

126
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:04,640
 And he came up with that in 1868.

127
00:06:04,640 --> 00:06:07,040
 And what excited me about that at first

128
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:09,040
 is because I did know of another Wunderlich

129
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:11,120
 that I'd read about recently.

130
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:12,800
 That's Jörg Wunderlich.

131
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:16,640
 And he found very recently the world's oldest known erection.

132
00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:19,360
 This was in a spider.

133
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:21,520
 Spiders don't always have erections,

134
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:22,960
 but some of the old ones did.

135
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:24,400
 And it was a harvestman.

136
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:28,720
 And 99 million years ago, it had a erection

137
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:32,320
 and then was killed by some flowing sap from a tree

138
00:06:32,320 --> 00:06:34,000
 which froze it in place.

139
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:37,680
 And this knocked back the earliest erection

140
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:40,320
 by something like 30 or 40 million years.

141
00:06:40,320 --> 00:06:41,760
 Wow.

142
00:06:41,760 --> 00:06:45,520
 Did that previous oldest erection just immediately go flaccid?

143
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:50,320
 Anyway, that's your Wunderlich.

144
00:06:50,320 --> 00:06:53,200
 That's so perfect, because obviously erections

145
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:55,440
 are often caused by a Wunderlich, aren't they?

146
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:58,560
 So it's extreme, just explaining the normative determinism

147
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:00,560
 for anyone who didn't make the link.

148
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:01,680
 Thanks, Hannah.

149
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:03,120
 James, are they related to these Wunderlichs?

150
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:04,480
 Or are you just using it as an excuse

151
00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:05,840
 to talk about spider penises?

152
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:08,560
 Andy, I spent so much time going through

153
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:12,640
 if the Wunderlich family ever needs any genealogy,

154
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:14,080
 I could help them so much,

155
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:16,480
 because I looked through their entire family tree.

156
00:07:16,480 --> 00:07:18,480
 Let's see through some really old records

157
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:21,040
 to try and find evidence of these two Wunderlichs were related.

158
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:23,760
 I was just picturing you in the British library

159
00:07:23,760 --> 00:07:27,280
 surrounded by dusty tomes all open to the Wunderlich page.

160
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:33,840
 I was thinking about the modern-day thermometers.

161
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:36,560
 We've all used a lot recently over the last year.

162
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:39,600
 And we've all thought, "Is this really working?"

163
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:42,080
 When you go into a public building or a place of work

164
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:44,400
 or a pub when we were allowed to go into pubs

165
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:46,320
 and you're standing in front of those thermometers

166
00:07:46,320 --> 00:07:48,080
 and they tell you what your temperature is.

167
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:48,960
 The forehead gun.

168
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:51,440
 Or also just a screen sometimes, isn't it?

169
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:55,520
 Yeah, a screen, a forehead gun, the non-touch thermometers.

170
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:56,560
 And I don't know about you guys,

171
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:59,200
 but often you get a reading that is ridiculous,

172
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:01,040
 like 33.5 or something.

173
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:04,000
 But then I always take the screen off and put it up my rectum.

174
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:09,840
 They've had to replace those on the BBC so many times.

175
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:12,000
 But they are very unreliable.

176
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
 So the FDA, the Food and Drug Administration,

177
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:17,200
 found, first of all, that the seven widely used ones,

178
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:19,840
 seven of the most widely used ones, what they do is,

179
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:22,480
 they compensate for imprecision and unpredictability,

180
00:08:22,480 --> 00:08:24,640
 which can be caused by, like, if it's a very hot day

181
00:08:24,640 --> 00:08:27,680
 or if you've just cycled to the work or something.

182
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:30,960
 They compensate for that by normalizing the readings,

183
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:33,040
 which essentially means that if they find a reading

184
00:08:33,040 --> 00:08:35,600
 that they think is too extreme, they bring it down again.

185
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:36,960
 Really? Oh, my God.

186
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:38,240
 I find that really interesting,

187
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:39,920
 because I am quite a sweaty man,

188
00:08:39,920 --> 00:08:41,360
 especially when I've been cycling.

189
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:44,480
 And I always cycle to the studios when we made QI.

190
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:48,240
 And I always think I must be in the high 50s, my temperature.

191
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:50,560
 But it always comes up as 30, whatever.

192
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:51,120
 I don't know what it is.

193
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:53,120
 I'm totally with you. I'm so with you.

194
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:55,440
 There must be a way for people to fail the readings.

195
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:57,280
 Otherwise, what is the point?

196
00:08:57,280 --> 00:08:58,080
 There is.

197
00:08:58,080 --> 00:08:59,680
 So that's quite a broad overview of what they do.

198
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:01,200
 So basically, the study found that you could have

199
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:02,800
 a core temperature of about 38.5,

200
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:04,880
 and it would readjust to 36.6.

201
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:06,480
 And its algorithms are trying to compensate

202
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:08,080
 for various other environmental factors

203
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:09,920
 that they think might be happening.

204
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:11,600
 But it's unreliable enough

205
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:14,400
 that you could also just have a temperature of 38.5

206
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:15,840
 and register as 36.

207
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:17,760
 And they did another study in Australia, I think,

208
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:20,240
 where they found that in five out of six cases,

209
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:21,520
 they missed a fever.

210
00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:23,920
 It's really interesting in terms of coronavirus.

211
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:26,480
 There was one company called Kinsey Health

212
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:29,680
 who have smartphone connected thermometers.

213
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:32,240
 And so basically, they've been gathering data

214
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:34,080
 for the last nine years.

215
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:36,640
 And in the lead-up to coronavirus,

216
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:38,400
 they basically spotted it

217
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:41,600
 because suddenly, there was this patch of high fevers

218
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:42,480
 around the whole country.

219
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:45,680
 They said it was like this big swarm of just high fevers.

220
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:47,280
 And they were going, "What the hell is this?"

221
00:09:47,280 --> 00:09:50,080
 And they tried to report it to various different people,

222
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:52,800
 but no one was taking the results as credible.

223
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:54,080
 And so they think for the future,

224
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:58,800
 these kind of smartphone-operated data-gathering thermometers

225
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:01,840
 might prevent us from ever really going too far

226
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:04,320
 down the line of an unrecognized pandemic.

227
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:05,280
 I just want to stick up

228
00:10:05,280 --> 00:10:07,920
 for the good old-fashioned mercury thermometers here,

229
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:09,280
 which is out of fashion

230
00:10:09,280 --> 00:10:11,840
 because apparently mercury is very dangerous.

231
00:10:11,840 --> 00:10:14,000
 And it turns out you can't buy mercury thermometers

232
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:14,880
 any more in the UK.

233
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:18,480
 I can't believe you don't know that.

234
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:20,240
 I feel like they were bound in my childhood.

235
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:22,480
 They were bound in 2009.

236
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:24,480
 I think we had them at my school.

237
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:25,520
 I think we had...

238
00:10:25,520 --> 00:10:29,440
 I remember some mercury smashing on the floor in my school

239
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:33,040
 and everyone panicking and throwing sand on it and stuff.

240
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:35,600
 I think it's perfectly safe to...

241
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:37,120
 Is that mercury?

242
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:38,560
 As long as you don't inhale the fumes,

243
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:40,480
 I think it's fine to swallow it, for example.

244
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:42,240
 Are we saying that really?

245
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:43,520
 Well, it doesn't matter.

246
00:10:43,520 --> 00:10:44,880
 No one's got one anymore, apparently,

247
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:46,240
 apart from me and my parents,

248
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:48,160
 who both work in the hat trade, and they're absolutely fine.

249
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:52,080
 It's insane.

250
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:55,040
 The EU, the EU, I have to say,

251
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:57,120
 the EU tried to ban barometers,

252
00:10:57,120 --> 00:10:58,480
 which also contain mercury,

253
00:10:58,480 --> 00:10:59,840
 because they contain mercury.

254
00:10:59,840 --> 00:11:00,880
 Antique barometers.

255
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:03,120
 This was a tiny amount of mercury.

256
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:03,520
 Oh, my God.

257
00:11:03,520 --> 00:11:06,480
 Right, Nigel, you have lost a plot a bit here,

258
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:08,240
 and I think we should emphasize that mercury

259
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:10,080
 can be very dangerous

260
00:11:10,080 --> 00:11:13,280
 if you smash one of those flimsy barometers.

261
00:11:13,280 --> 00:11:15,200
 If anyone agrees with Andy,

262
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:18,240
 then there will be a rally at the White Cliffs of Dover.

263
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:19,440
 Bring your own barometer.

264
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:24,800
 We'll all, together, smash the barometers

265
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:27,360
 and drink the mercury and prove.

266
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:31,200
 And that is how survival of the fittest works.

267
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:32,320
 Well, you're like this, Andy.

268
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:35,760
 You know who had mercury in them when they went to space?

269
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:38,240
 Oh, that does narrow it down.

270
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:39,440
 It does, doesn't it?

271
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:40,000
 Yeah.

272
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:40,960
 Chong Glenn.

273
00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:42,080
 Chong Glenn would have.

274
00:11:42,080 --> 00:11:43,920
 The mercury astronauts.

275
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:45,520
 Oh, you're kidding.

276
00:11:45,520 --> 00:11:46,480
 So they had mercury.

277
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:48,880
 Well, to an extent,

278
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:51,200
 all the mercury astronauts that went into space,

279
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:52,800
 they had all their vital signs

280
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:54,640
 being sussed out the whole way through.

281
00:11:54,640 --> 00:11:56,720
 They sort of had all these pads

282
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:58,560
 on them monitoring their heart rates and stuff.

283
00:11:58,560 --> 00:11:59,920
 But what I hadn't read before

284
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:03,680
 is they also had a thermometer up the bum for their trips.

285
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:06,960
 All the mercury astronauts, except for the final one,

286
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:08,720
 had a thermometer in their bum.

287
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:11,600
 It must have been strange when the aliens got them

288
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:13,280
 and they started adally probing them.

289
00:12:13,280 --> 00:12:14,160
 And they're like, what?

290
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:15,440
 Someone's been here already.

291
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:20,720
 Yeah, so that was a thing.

292
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:23,440
 And was it up there the whole time?

293
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:25,360
 Yeah, because how long were the missions?

294
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:26,400
 These weren't long missions, right?

295
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:28,400
 They would go up, they would orbit the planets.

296
00:12:28,400 --> 00:12:30,080
 I imagine they felt longer, didn't they?

297
00:12:30,080 --> 00:12:32,640
 How do you know the difference

298
00:12:32,640 --> 00:12:35,280
 between a rectal thermometer and an oral thermometer?

299
00:12:35,280 --> 00:12:36,720
 This is very important, I reckon.

300
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:38,400
 This feels like a joke.

301
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:39,280
 It's not a joke.

302
00:12:39,280 --> 00:12:42,800
 Feels like it's going to be the smell.

303
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:46,480
 Before it's been used.

304
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:48,800
 How do you work it out before it's been used?

305
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:51,680
 Is it the size of the bulb or something?

306
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:52,800
 Pretty much right, yeah.

307
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:55,920
 So a rectal thermometer will always have a round bulbous tip.

308
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:58,480
 And an oral thermometer will have a longer, thin tip.

309
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:01,360
 And according to the website, I read it said,

310
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:03,120
 a rectal thermometer should never be used

311
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:04,320
 to take an oral temperature.

312
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:06,240
 And an oral thermometer should never be used

313
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:07,760
 to take a rectal temperature.

314
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:11,360
 But either one can be used to take an armpit temperature.

315
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:13,440
 So it's just a little tip.

316
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:14,720
 The Switzerland temperature.

317
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:18,160
 Is that not because of the danger of contamination?

318
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:19,440
 It does feel like just to be safe.

319
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:21,680
 They're saying, obviously, don't put something

320
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:23,680
 that might have been in someone's bum in your mouth.

321
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:27,040
 I think that's quite sensible in that direction.

322
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:28,320
 And then in the other direction,

323
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:31,200
 you don't want something spiky going up your bum.

324
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:32,720
 Yeah, that's true as well.

325
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:34,880
 And the other thing is, and the very important

326
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:36,480
 to get the difference between the thermometer

327
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:38,080
 and the barometer when you're putting it up.

328
00:13:38,080 --> 00:13:42,080
 A rectal barometer.

329
00:13:42,080 --> 00:13:44,800
 Just get the pressure up there.

330
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:49,200
 Your mind is taken completely off

331
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:50,800
 what the weather is going to be doing tomorrow.

332
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:56,720
 I was reading about nature's thermometer.

333
00:13:56,720 --> 00:14:01,200
 And there was a scientist called Amos Dolbert

334
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:06,160
 who noticed that crickets would chirp at a certain rate.

335
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:09,920
 And if you counted the number of clicks that they were doing,

336
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:13,280
 you could tell what the temperature was.

337
00:14:13,280 --> 00:14:16,560
 And it was useful and unuseful because, A,

338
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:19,360
 he didn't specify what species of cricket it was.

339
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:21,680
 So everyone was just like, we've got the readings,

340
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:23,840
 but we can't find what the hell you're talking about.

341
00:14:23,840 --> 00:14:26,560
 They think that it was a snowy tree cricket.

342
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:29,120
 But then they also have noticed

343
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:30,960
 that there are other field crickets that do it,

344
00:14:30,960 --> 00:14:32,160
 but not all field crickets.

345
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:33,920
 So it's the weirdest thermometer.

346
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:36,960
 You need this one specific cricket in order to tell it.

347
00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:38,560
 And then there's others that might tell you,

348
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:40,160
 and others that will get it wrong

349
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:41,920
 if they're a different part of the same species.

350
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:42,800
 It's really bizarre.

351
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:45,520
 I think also, if it goes below a certain temperature,

352
00:14:45,520 --> 00:14:47,840
 they all go to sleep and stop doing anything at all.

353
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:52,320
 But if you find that one species

354
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:54,080
 that we're not even sure is the right species,

355
00:14:54,080 --> 00:14:56,480
 then you can tell the temperature.

356
00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:58,000
 The advantage of the cricket thermometer

357
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,560
 is that crickets are not toxic, unlike mercury.

358
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:04,800
 So you can eat them without any serious harm.

359
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:06,240
 But don't stick them up your bum.

360
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:08,080
 That will not work.

361
00:15:08,080 --> 00:15:09,120
 It's hard to hear them chirp.

362
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,240
 OK, it is time for fact number two.

363
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:23,520
 And that is Anna.

364
00:15:23,520 --> 00:15:26,560
 My fact this week is that Cold War spy planes

365
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:28,400
 were equipped with rear view mirrors

366
00:15:28,400 --> 00:15:29,760
 so that pilots could check

367
00:15:29,760 --> 00:15:31,440
 they weren't leaving a trail behind them.

368
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:33,200
 Like a paper trail?

369
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:34,320
 What kind of trail we're talking?

370
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:37,600
 Just dropping clues out the window.

371
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:39,200
 Then I shouldn't have done that.

372
00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:41,520
 A con trail.

373
00:15:41,520 --> 00:15:43,840
 Or, as some of you might know them, a chem trail.

374
00:15:43,840 --> 00:15:44,800
 Oh my God.

375
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:46,640
 Wow, straight into the test tube.

376
00:15:49,280 --> 00:15:50,480
 I'm going to reverse out of that.

377
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:51,360
 They're just con trails.

378
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:52,080
 They're not chem trails.

379
00:15:52,080 --> 00:15:53,040
 What does the con mean, is it?

380
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:56,960
 It's a big old con, spawned by the government.

381
00:15:56,960 --> 00:16:01,200
 So con trails are basically that kind of string of white

382
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:03,680
 that comes out of the bottom of a plane

383
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:04,480
 when it's flying.

384
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:07,840
 And it's created when water condenses to form ice crystals

385
00:16:07,840 --> 00:16:10,800
 around the tiny particles of kind of soot and dirt and dust

386
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:13,360
 that are being emitted from the aircraft exhausts.

387
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:15,760
 And major problem for spy planes,

388
00:16:15,760 --> 00:16:18,160
 because often a spy plane is so high up you can't see it.

389
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:20,240
 But what you can see is this trail,

390
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:21,680
 which, if you follow it to the front,

391
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:23,840
 leads directly to the plane that you need to shoot down.

392
00:16:23,840 --> 00:16:28,320
 And it was known, but they sort of started spotting them

393
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:29,920
 in the early Second World War.

394
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:32,480
 And all planes had kind of rear view mirrors,

395
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:33,360
 or war planes did,

396
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:35,040
 because you needed to see if someone was chasing you,

397
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:36,320
 or most war planes did.

398
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:39,120
 And then after that, they didn't.

399
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:41,840
 But it became apparent in the 1950s,

400
00:16:41,840 --> 00:16:45,680
 when the Lockheed U2 very famous spy planes were being made,

401
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:47,520
 that however high up they were,

402
00:16:47,520 --> 00:16:50,160
 it wasn't going to work in evading detection

403
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:51,760
 because they were leaving contrails,

404
00:16:51,760 --> 00:16:53,680
 unless they had a way of looking behind them

405
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:55,440
 to see if they were and avoid it.

406
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:57,040
 And so they just have these little mirrors.

407
00:16:57,040 --> 00:16:59,520
 So you've got the most high tech plane possibly ever.

408
00:16:59,520 --> 00:17:01,680
 And then on a little pole on its nose,

409
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:03,040
 you've got a rear view mirror.

410
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:04,960
 And if you check behind you and you see the trail,

411
00:17:04,960 --> 00:17:06,400
 you can kind of change your altitude,

412
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:08,800
 or change your speed, or reduce the throttle.

413
00:17:08,800 --> 00:17:10,400
 And that can reduce the trail.

414
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:13,920
 Yeah, I think like certain areas of the sky

415
00:17:13,920 --> 00:17:16,960
 are more susceptible to contrails, aren't they?

416
00:17:16,960 --> 00:17:17,840
 I think because they have a bit more water.

417
00:17:17,840 --> 00:17:19,120
 The moisty bits, isn't it?

418
00:17:19,120 --> 00:17:19,760
 The moisty bits.

419
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:20,480
 The moisty bits.

420
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:22,480
 Yeah, I didn't want to get too technical, but yes.

421
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:26,320
 But it changes, it changes a lot, doesn't it?

422
00:17:26,320 --> 00:17:29,040
 It's not like you can't fly between these altitudes.

423
00:17:29,040 --> 00:17:30,640
 It's sometimes, you know,

424
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:32,960
 it's only a few hundred meters of altitude that changes it.

425
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:35,920
 So it does feel very finessed what they're doing.

426
00:17:35,920 --> 00:17:39,120
 Yeah, those spy planes are, they are incredible.

427
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:40,480
 Yeah, the U2.

428
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:43,600
 The mirror is literally the least interesting thing about it

429
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:45,280
 when you start looking to it.

430
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:46,160
 Just one minute.

431
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:47,440
 I mean, your fact is great,

432
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:51,040
 but what I mean is these planes were astonishing.

433
00:17:51,040 --> 00:17:54,800
 So can I give my quick favorite fact about the U2 spy planes?

434
00:17:54,800 --> 00:17:58,080
 It takes two pilots to land a U2 spy plane,

435
00:17:58,080 --> 00:17:59,760
 one inside the plane,

436
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:03,440
 and one on the ground in a car chasing the plane.

437
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:06,720
 Because the outfit that you need to wear

438
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:09,760
 in order to go 70,000 feet into the air,

439
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:11,280
 which is how high these planes go,

440
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:13,600
 it's basically you need to wear astronaut gear.

441
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:15,760
 And it's really hard to turn yourself

442
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:18,880
 and see where you're landing in these planes.

443
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:21,280
 So as you're coming in to land,

444
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:23,760
 the other pilot in the car is driving behind you

445
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:25,840
 and radioing in your position,

446
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:27,680
 going, "You're nearly there, just a bit more, mate.

447
00:18:27,680 --> 00:18:29,600
 Come on, you got better codes than that."

448
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:32,800
 But literally speaks you into a landing

449
00:18:32,800 --> 00:18:35,600
 in a car going 140 miles an hour behind you.

450
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:36,720
 It's unbelievable.

451
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:38,000
 It's extraordinary.

452
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,560
 Basically, it's a plane that's designed to be 70,000 feet up.

453
00:18:40,560 --> 00:18:42,640
 It doesn't really like being at ground level.

454
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:44,880
 So it's got two...

455
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:47,360
 You know, the normal set of plane wheels are in a triangle.

456
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:49,520
 So you've got the two sets at the back and one at the front,

457
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:50,400
 and you come down on the back one,

458
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:52,640
 set the front one, it's lovely, jubbly, you're on the ground.

459
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:55,440
 The U2 plane has got two sets of wheels,

460
00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:58,000
 which are lined up front to back like a bicycle.

461
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:01,680
 And I mean, it's just a nightmare to land.

462
00:19:01,680 --> 00:19:03,360
 You basically have to slow down so much

463
00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:04,480
 that it can't fly anymore.

464
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:05,680
 That's how you land it.

465
00:19:05,680 --> 00:19:07,920
 You get to about two feet above the ground,

466
00:19:07,920 --> 00:19:09,840
 and then you just slow down and slow down and slow down,

467
00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:12,480
 and it will just drop out of the sky onto these double wheels.

468
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:14,240
 Now, you stall it, don't you?

469
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:16,000
 You have to stall before you touch the ground.

470
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:16,720
 Every time.

471
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:19,600
 But then you don't properly stop until the plane tips over,

472
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:21,520
 effectively crashing.

473
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:24,000
 Like, basically, you have to crash land

474
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:24,960
 in order to stop the plane.

475
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:27,280
 And what they have is these steel plates

476
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:29,680
 underneath each of the wingtips.

477
00:19:29,680 --> 00:19:32,480
 So whichever side it keels over onto,

478
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:35,840
 that's the bit that starts helping them come to a full stop.

479
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:37,760
 It reminds me, if you know when you're a kid

480
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:38,800
 and you're learning to ride a bike,

481
00:19:38,800 --> 00:19:40,960
 I think that tends to be how you stop at first,

482
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:43,200
 is you just wait until you fall off one side.

483
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:44,080
 It's like that.

484
00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:45,760
 Same with me when skiing.

485
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:46,240
 There you go.

486
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:50,080
 When you're flying them, you were saying about stalling.

487
00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:52,000
 If you go too slow, then you'll stall.

488
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,640
 But if you go too fast, then the plane falls apart.

489
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:57,680
 And so there's only a 12-miles-an-hour speed window

490
00:19:57,680 --> 00:19:58,960
 that you're allowed to fly in.

491
00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:00,960
 And if you go too slow, you crash.

492
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:02,640
 And if you go too fast, you crash.

493
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:04,160
 So you're basically the whole time

494
00:20:04,160 --> 00:20:05,360
 just looking at the speed up.

495
00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:08,320
 It's like, oh, oh, oh.

496
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:09,520
 I think it sometimes--

497
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:11,600
 I think it can be as low as seven sometimes.

498
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:13,280
 It's called the coffin corner,

499
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:15,920
 which they've got to start rebranding some of their names

500
00:20:15,920 --> 00:20:17,280
 as if you're not scared enough.

501
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:18,880
 But yeah, it's amazing.

502
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:22,320
 And it's because it flies so high is when you're flying high.

503
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:25,120
 Your max speed is when you break the sound barrier.

504
00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:27,120
 And the sound barrier gets lower and lower,

505
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:28,800
 the higher and higher you get, right?

506
00:20:28,800 --> 00:20:29,680
 So as soon as you get high,

507
00:20:29,680 --> 00:20:30,960
 you're going to break the sound barrier

508
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:32,400
 if you go not that fast.

509
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:34,640
 They're just such gorgeous machines.

510
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:36,480
 And I didn't realize they're so old as well.

511
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:38,880
 The model first flew in 1955.

512
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:41,760
 And I don't think any of those actual planes themselves

513
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:42,880
 are still in the air today.

514
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:45,440
 But the model has been adjusted a bit since then.

515
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:46,880
 But it's being updated now.

516
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:48,800
 It's probably going to be flying for another 30 years.

517
00:20:48,800 --> 00:20:49,360
 It's probably going--

518
00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:52,800
 This one model of plane is probably going to do 100 years

519
00:20:52,800 --> 00:20:54,320
 in service, which is mad.

520
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:56,480
 Do you know what potentially--

521
00:20:56,480 --> 00:20:59,600
 I think we can say the U2 spy plane

522
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:02,720
 is responsible for a very exciting thing

523
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:04,000
 in the world of conspiracy.

524
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,560
 Is it the Joshua tree?

525
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:08,400
 Off.

526
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:10,320
 I was hoping we'd get onto the U2 puns.

527
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:13,920
 It's sitting here saying, you know--

528
00:21:13,920 --> 00:21:15,840
 Who's going to crack first?

529
00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:16,320
 Yeah.

530
00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:16,560
 No.

531
00:21:16,560 --> 00:21:21,120
 Area 51 in the Nevada desert.

532
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:24,640
 It was-- there were some declassified documents

533
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:26,400
 that came out a number of years ago,

534
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:28,800
 which showed that they needed a testing space

535
00:21:28,800 --> 00:21:31,120
 for the spy plane, for the U2 spy plane.

536
00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:33,680
 So they needed somewhere to officially do that.

537
00:21:33,680 --> 00:21:36,320
 And that is what Area 51 was set up for.

538
00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:36,960
 Wow.

539
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:39,600
 Area 51 famously, where the streets have no name.

540
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:41,040
 There you go.

541
00:21:41,040 --> 00:21:41,280
 Yeah.

542
00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:42,000
 There we go.

543
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,120
 That's number two.

544
00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:43,840
 Absolutely.

545
00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:44,880
 Keep counting.

546
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:47,920
 Anyway, let's talk about the elevation

547
00:21:47,920 --> 00:21:49,680
 that these planes are flying at.

548
00:21:49,680 --> 00:21:50,800
 Jesus Christ.

549
00:21:50,800 --> 00:21:52,400
 Pilots often get vertigo.

550
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:54,160
 It's just for Anna, that was another--

551
00:21:54,160 --> 00:21:55,280
 I didn't get that.

552
00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:57,120
 OK, I only got that that was a joke

553
00:21:57,120 --> 00:21:58,800
 when James said Jesus Christ after it.

554
00:21:58,800 --> 00:22:00,000
 Yeah, did you get the one after that,

555
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,080
 which I didn't say Jesus Christ about?

556
00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:03,120
 Was it vertigo?

557
00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:04,960
 That seemed like an unusual word to throw in.

558
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:07,600
 Look, the important point is, when they're flying,

559
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:09,440
 whether it's a beautiful day,

560
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:11,440
 whether they're flying over a city of blinding lights--

561
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:12,240
 Jesus Christ.

562
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:13,040
 Jesus Christ.

563
00:22:13,040 --> 00:22:13,360
 Sorry.

564
00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:17,200
 I do feel like I have to punctuate these now.

565
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:18,720
 I've got a whole spreadsheet of these.

566
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:23,520
 So they're photographing.

567
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:24,240
 That's what they're for.

568
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:30,480
 The spy planes, it's for taking photos of territory

569
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:32,080
 the US is trying to observe.

570
00:22:32,080 --> 00:22:34,400
 But they still shoot on film.

571
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:35,680
 And this was reported in 2018.

572
00:22:35,680 --> 00:22:37,360
 They're not using digital cameras at all.

573
00:22:37,360 --> 00:22:39,760
 They have a lens the size of a dinner plate

574
00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:40,800
 on the bottom of the plane.

575
00:22:40,800 --> 00:22:44,320
 And then apparently they FedEx the film

576
00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:46,480
 back to California to be analyzed.

577
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:49,200
 And it has rolls of film inside at this plane,

578
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:50,400
 which are two miles long.

579
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:52,560
 Pretty cool.

580
00:22:52,560 --> 00:22:56,240
 And OK, I had no idea how good the technology was,

581
00:22:56,240 --> 00:23:00,000
 but they photograph all of Afghanistan every month

582
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:00,960
 just to see what's going on.

583
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:02,000
 What, even the edge?

584
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:04,240
 Yes.

585
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:05,760
 Sorry.

586
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:06,400
 Jesus Christ.

587
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:06,800
 There we go.

588
00:23:06,800 --> 00:23:10,240
 He's the guitarist in the band.

589
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:12,720
 Oh, OK.

590
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:14,720
 So it's a new angle of puns now.

591
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:15,600
 Nice.

592
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:20,080
 But the photos are so good, or the cameras are so good,

593
00:23:20,080 --> 00:23:21,680
 that you can differentiate between objects

594
00:23:21,680 --> 00:23:24,000
 which are just eight inches apart on the ground.

595
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:24,720
 Wow.

596
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:26,240
 Are we going to talk about chemtrails?

597
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:30,000
 Let's talk about the government trying to poison us.

598
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:33,200
 So chemtrails is the idea that the government

599
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:37,280
 are trying to poison us by putting stuff in contrails.

600
00:23:37,280 --> 00:23:39,680
 Or it might be that they're trying to change the weather,

601
00:23:39,680 --> 00:23:41,600
 or there's lots of things that they might be doing,

602
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:43,840
 and they're almost certainly not doing.

603
00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:46,240
 But there was a study very recently.

604
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:49,520
 This was researched at the University of California, Irvine,

605
00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:51,680
 and the Carnegie Institution of Science.

606
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:56,320
 And they asked 77 of the world's leading atmospheric scientists

607
00:23:56,320 --> 00:23:59,680
 if they had any evidence that the government

608
00:23:59,680 --> 00:24:03,200
 was spraying stuff out of airplanes, changing the atmosphere,

609
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:06,080
 or controlling overpopulation, or controlling food supply,

610
00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:06,560
 or whatever.

611
00:24:06,560 --> 00:24:10,720
 76 of them said there is no evidence whatsoever.

612
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:15,120
 And one of them didn't say that there was no evidence.

613
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:18,960
 And so, obviously, people just jumped on that and went,

614
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:20,560
 "Yes, but what about that one guy?"

615
00:24:20,560 --> 00:24:24,560
 But all he was doing was basically, there was an area

616
00:24:24,560 --> 00:24:28,080
 which had high levels of barium, which there was currently

617
00:24:28,080 --> 00:24:29,520
 no explanation for.

618
00:24:29,520 --> 00:24:32,720
 And he was simply not ruling out the possibility

619
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:35,120
 that someone could have dropped it from an airplane.

620
00:24:35,120 --> 00:24:37,120
 There are a million other things that it could be,

621
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:40,640
 but he just, as a scientist, like scientists do,

622
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:43,120
 until you have the evidence to rule it out, not ruling it out.

623
00:24:43,120 --> 00:24:45,280
 And that's why he said, you know...

624
00:24:45,280 --> 00:24:47,840
 Well, it sounds very suspect to me, that's all I'm saying.

625
00:24:47,840 --> 00:24:51,360
 No, the sad thing about chemtrails,

626
00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:55,120
 the really ironic thing about people who believe in chemtrails,

627
00:24:55,120 --> 00:24:57,520
 is that I think currently, the predominant belief

628
00:24:57,520 --> 00:24:59,760
 is that the reason the government are apparently

629
00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:01,920
 putting these chemicals into contrails

630
00:25:01,920 --> 00:25:04,080
 is to mitigate global warming.

631
00:25:04,080 --> 00:25:07,120
 So, people believe that to mitigate global warming,

632
00:25:07,120 --> 00:25:09,120
 chemicals are being sprayed up into the atmosphere

633
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:11,280
 to block the heat from the sun.

634
00:25:11,280 --> 00:25:13,120
 And so, stop the planet warming.

635
00:25:13,120 --> 00:25:15,040
 But people think that these chemicals

636
00:25:15,040 --> 00:25:17,520
 are very bad for our health and very bad for the environment.

637
00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:19,440
 Therefore, they're being kept a secret.

638
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:23,040
 However, the truth is that contrails are extremely bad

639
00:25:23,040 --> 00:25:24,080
 for global warming.

640
00:25:24,080 --> 00:25:26,160
 So, I had no idea about this.

641
00:25:26,160 --> 00:25:27,840
 But it's so interesting.

642
00:25:27,840 --> 00:25:30,640
 Basically, the kind of cloud they essentially create,

643
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:32,560
 like a fake cirrus cloud,

644
00:25:32,560 --> 00:25:34,480
 is one of those really wispy ones.

645
00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:37,600
 And so, what that means is it lets almost all the sunlight through,

646
00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:40,800
 but it traps all the heat underneath.

647
00:25:40,800 --> 00:25:42,560
 And so, it does the opposite of clouds,

648
00:25:42,560 --> 00:25:44,400
 which at least don't let any sunlight through.

649
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:47,200
 So, like big, big thick clouds don't let sunlight through,

650
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:48,720
 but they still trap heat.

651
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:50,320
 And there's a study done that showed

652
00:25:50,320 --> 00:25:55,200
 that they are the main cause of aviation-based climate change.

653
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:58,080
 So, when it looked at how much climate change

654
00:25:58,080 --> 00:25:59,280
 was affected by various things,

655
00:25:59,280 --> 00:26:01,440
 50% was due to contrails,

656
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:03,120
 trapping the heat in and letting light through.

657
00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:06,080
 And only 34% was carbon dioxide,

658
00:26:06,080 --> 00:26:07,360
 which has to be qualified

659
00:26:07,360 --> 00:26:10,000
 with the fact that carbon dioxide stays in the atmosphere for ages,

660
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:13,200
 whereas the contrails are gone as soon as they've gone.

661
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:15,040
 But even so, I find that amazing.

662
00:26:15,040 --> 00:26:16,480
 They're causing a massive, massive problem.

663
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:17,520
 Yeah, it's amazing.

664
00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:20,000
 And that's why we need to find a way these days

665
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:21,440
 to not have the contrails.

666
00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:23,120
 In the olden days, it was to stop the enemy

667
00:26:23,120 --> 00:26:24,800
 from seeing where your plane is,

668
00:26:24,800 --> 00:26:27,280
 but now it's trying to help the environment.

669
00:26:27,280 --> 00:26:30,960
 And there is a new system called Satavia,

670
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:34,720
 which uses AI to work out where in the world all of the...

671
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:38,560
 What did you call them? Moistly areas?

672
00:26:38,560 --> 00:26:39,520
 Dan, I can't remember.

673
00:26:39,520 --> 00:26:41,200
 Moisty. The moisty bits.

674
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:43,200
 The high-moistier areas.

675
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:46,400
 And kind of sets up a map and can tell aeroplanes

676
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:49,920
 when to move into areas with low moisture.

677
00:26:49,920 --> 00:26:51,680
 So, they don't have as many contrails.

678
00:26:51,680 --> 00:26:53,120
 Just one other thing to say about contrails

679
00:26:53,120 --> 00:26:55,040
 is that the reason that they're bad...

680
00:26:55,040 --> 00:26:56,320
 We know the reason they're bad,

681
00:26:56,320 --> 00:26:57,920
 but the reason they're so effective

682
00:26:57,920 --> 00:27:01,200
 is that it's not just one plane that's leaving a trail in the sky.

683
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:04,960
 It's dozens of planes flying the same route, basically.

684
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:06,720
 And so, rather than just one line in the sky,

685
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:10,400
 it's kind of like a massive string vest for the entire planet,

686
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:12,240
 which is obviously very good at keeping in heat.

687
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:14,480
 Interesting.

688
00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:15,680
 That's the problem, really.

689
00:27:15,680 --> 00:27:18,720
 It's amazing because there's so much sky

690
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:22,640
 that you would think that a number of planes

691
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:25,440
 wouldn't be enough contrail to make a difference.

692
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:29,120
 There's a lot of sky when you look up, you know?

693
00:27:29,120 --> 00:27:31,280
 Yeah, that's where to look to find the sky.

694
00:27:31,280 --> 00:27:34,560
 I can't deny that. There's a lot of planes, though.

695
00:27:34,560 --> 00:27:39,600
 There are, yeah, but I'm not seeing Andy's string vest

696
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:40,880
 in the sky every day, you know?

697
00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:42,720
 That's what I mean. There's not much of a string vest,

698
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:43,840
 but it keeps you warm.

699
00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:47,600
 Very stringy string vest. Very revealing.

700
00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:50,720
 Very sexy string vest.

701
00:27:51,840 --> 00:27:54,080
 The other planets are dreadfully jealous of Earth.

702
00:27:54,080 --> 00:27:55,760
 Let's see get off.

703
00:27:55,760 --> 00:28:05,120
 Okay, it is time for fact number three, and that is my fact.

704
00:28:05,120 --> 00:28:08,080
 My fact this week is that in 12th century China,

705
00:28:08,080 --> 00:28:11,040
 judges used to wear sunglasses in the courtroom.

706
00:28:11,040 --> 00:28:13,760
 Cool judges.

707
00:28:13,760 --> 00:28:16,480
 Or because it was sunny in the courtroom.

708
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:18,400
 Nope. No, they were indoors.

709
00:28:19,120 --> 00:28:23,760
 This was a thing that was done in order to hide the emotion

710
00:28:23,760 --> 00:28:28,000
 of the judges as they were taking the case on

711
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:30,080
 so that no one could read what they were thinking.

712
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:33,840
 It was just a very clever way of putting on these quartz glasses.

713
00:28:33,840 --> 00:28:35,680
 They're made of quartz, and you'd be like,

714
00:28:35,680 --> 00:28:36,880
 "What's he thinking? What's he thinking?"

715
00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:39,680
 "I don't know. He's got his cool sunnies on."

716
00:28:39,680 --> 00:28:40,560
 So, yeah.

717
00:28:40,560 --> 00:28:43,520
 That's cool that it's quartz for the courts.

718
00:28:43,520 --> 00:28:45,200
 Nice, I bet they must have gotten up so good

719
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:46,480
 in their advertising.

720
00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:51,520
 Very true. I'm sure ancient China specifically had the word quartz and quartz.

721
00:28:51,520 --> 00:28:52,000
 I think so.

722
00:28:52,000 --> 00:29:00,400
 Yeah, and this is a fact which has led to what I think is an incredibly fun

723
00:29:00,400 --> 00:29:05,520
 set of emails between James and Anna in terms of trying to verify.

724
00:29:05,520 --> 00:29:07,520
 Could we quickly talk about that for a second?

725
00:29:07,520 --> 00:29:09,360
 Anna, you've been trying to verify this fact

726
00:29:09,360 --> 00:29:11,360
 for the last five years, it turns out.

727
00:29:11,360 --> 00:29:15,680
 It's been a long, long slog, and I think it's probably true.

728
00:29:15,680 --> 00:29:19,360
 It's cited in - what's the guy called?

729
00:29:19,360 --> 00:29:22,000
 James, then you joined the Getting Very Obsessed bandwagon.

730
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:23,360
 Kind of overtook me, I think.

731
00:29:23,360 --> 00:29:24,720
 Joseph Needham.

732
00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:27,840
 Joseph Needham is like the historian of ancient China

733
00:29:27,840 --> 00:29:31,760
 who does cite an original source saying that this is why judges did it, right?

734
00:29:31,760 --> 00:29:32,480
 Yeah, he does.

735
00:29:32,480 --> 00:29:39,680
 He says that someone called Liu Qi wrote in a book called Xia Ji Qi.

736
00:29:39,680 --> 00:29:43,760
 Now, I don't find any evidence that these books or this person exists

737
00:29:43,760 --> 00:29:47,600
 anywhere else, but it could be because the internet isn't great on 12th century China.

738
00:29:47,600 --> 00:29:55,440
 But he says that they wrote about this guy called Xi Qiang, who was a judge who used them.

739
00:29:55,440 --> 00:29:58,640
 But he does say in a footnote in the bigger version of his book,

740
00:29:58,640 --> 00:30:02,320
 this piece of information, which I fully believe to be true,

741
00:30:02,320 --> 00:30:06,880
 comes from a paper on fire pearls and spectacles by Pi,

742
00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:11,120
 which though interesting, is full of serious and misleading mistakes.

743
00:30:11,760 --> 00:30:17,280
 So he's only got it from this one source and he says that the source is unreliable.

744
00:30:17,280 --> 00:30:20,160
 But he actually believes it and Anna believes it.

745
00:30:20,160 --> 00:30:24,160
 And if those two believe it, then I've got to say I have to believe it as well.

746
00:30:24,160 --> 00:30:24,800
 Yeah.

747
00:30:24,800 --> 00:30:26,480
 Needham's got the instinct, you know?

748
00:30:26,480 --> 00:30:29,360
 He can feel his way around ancient China in a way we can't.

749
00:30:29,360 --> 00:30:31,360
 If he thinks it's true, surely.

750
00:30:31,360 --> 00:30:33,520
 Well, Needham is extraordinary, isn't he?

751
00:30:33,520 --> 00:30:39,120
 I mean, this guy was the authority on the old science of ancient China.

752
00:30:39,120 --> 00:30:44,320
 Yeah, he was visited by three Chinese students in 1937

753
00:30:44,320 --> 00:30:46,400
 and suddenly got really interested in China.

754
00:30:46,400 --> 00:30:50,800
 And he spent three years setting up an office in China

755
00:30:50,800 --> 00:30:54,560
 and going up and down the whole of the country trying to find all these different sources.

756
00:30:54,560 --> 00:31:00,160
 And his book was described as perhaps the greatest single act of historical

757
00:31:00,160 --> 00:31:05,200
 synthesis and intercultural communication ever attempted by one man.

758
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:06,720
 It's incredible.

759
00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:10,240
 And you know all these things where we say, oh, this was invented in China.

760
00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:11,680
 This was invented in China.

761
00:31:11,680 --> 00:31:15,280
 So many of them are basically down to this one guy's research.

762
00:31:15,280 --> 00:31:17,680
 So if you thought James and I were getting obsessive,

763
00:31:17,680 --> 00:31:20,880
 he really is the pinnacle, isn't he, of going over the top.

764
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:23,520
 He was a pretty extraordinary guy.

765
00:31:23,520 --> 00:31:30,880
 He, during World War II, he lobbied for UNESCO to basically add the S in UNESCO.

766
00:31:30,880 --> 00:31:35,360
 There's a thing that is said that he is responsible for the S in UNESCO, which is science.

767
00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:39,360
 Yeah. So it was United Nations, educational and cultural.

768
00:31:39,360 --> 00:31:42,160
 So it was UNESCO and then he was like, no, no, come on guys.

769
00:31:42,160 --> 00:31:43,760
 It scans way better as well, doesn't it?

770
00:31:43,760 --> 00:31:45,760
 Yeah, definitely does.

771
00:31:45,760 --> 00:31:49,600
 I guess we should say he's one of the first ever sunglasses.

772
00:31:49,600 --> 00:31:56,560
 And well, I'm sure they're pretty old sunglasses, you know, 800 years, 900 years.

773
00:31:56,560 --> 00:32:03,200
 But we think that the first sunglasses were Inuit invention.

774
00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:09,120
 And they were kind of goggles to prevent snow blindness made of carved wood or bone.

775
00:32:09,120 --> 00:32:14,160
 And it can be really dangerous if you're exposed to ultraviolet light too much.

776
00:32:14,160 --> 00:32:17,760
 And obviously when the sunlight bounces off the snow and into your eyes, that can happen.

777
00:32:17,760 --> 00:32:21,840
 So these are about 2000 years old, perhaps older, perhaps four.

778
00:32:21,840 --> 00:32:24,800
 And they've got a strap made from walrus hide.

779
00:32:24,800 --> 00:32:28,960
 Do you remember we did ages ago, we talked about how they made everything out of walrus hide.

780
00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:31,200
 Well, these goggles were no exception.

781
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:33,920
 And so they're more snow goggles, I guess, than sunglasses.

782
00:32:33,920 --> 00:32:36,720
 But they're a pretty good candidate, I reckon.

783
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:38,960
 There's no glass in them for a start.

784
00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:39,920
 Okay, all right.

785
00:32:39,920 --> 00:32:49,920
 First tinted like glass glass sunglasses, I think, were from the place where you got

786
00:32:49,920 --> 00:32:52,080
 all the best glass, really, which was Venice.

787
00:32:52,080 --> 00:32:56,720
 I think we've talked about them before, how Venice had this amazing glass industry.

788
00:32:56,720 --> 00:32:58,800
 And they made lots of mirrors and things like that.

789
00:32:59,680 --> 00:33:04,480
 These were called Galdoni glasses, and they were made in the late 18th century.

790
00:33:04,480 --> 00:33:07,840
 And they weren't made by Galdoni, but they were popularized by him.

791
00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:12,880
 He was a playwright, and he always wore these particular like tinted glasses.

792
00:33:12,880 --> 00:33:14,160
 And everyone kind of copied him.

793
00:33:14,160 --> 00:33:17,440
 All the gondoliers would wear them on the canals.

794
00:33:17,440 --> 00:33:23,840
 And the other interesting thing about Carlo Galdoni is he is the person who wrote "One Man, Two Governors".

795
00:33:23,840 --> 00:33:25,360
 Did he?

796
00:33:25,360 --> 00:33:27,520
 Oh, he did.

797
00:33:27,520 --> 00:33:29,040
 James Gordon knows everything to him.

798
00:33:29,760 --> 00:33:30,640
 Exactly.

799
00:33:30,640 --> 00:33:35,600
 He wrote an Italian, obviously, play called "The Servant of Two Masters",

800
00:33:35,600 --> 00:33:37,600
 which was adapted into that play.

801
00:33:37,600 --> 00:33:38,240
 Very cool.

802
00:33:38,240 --> 00:33:40,720
 Wow, yeah, it was a huge deal, wasn't it?

803
00:33:40,720 --> 00:33:43,760
 As I suppose you have to be to set an actual trend.

804
00:33:43,760 --> 00:33:48,880
 But he moved Italy away from Comedia dell'Arto and into more realism.

805
00:33:48,880 --> 00:33:54,400
 But he did wear green glasses, which is, well, it's kind of comedic.

806
00:33:54,400 --> 00:33:57,680
 But yeah, the lenses tend to be green on those old glasses,

807
00:33:57,680 --> 00:33:59,040
 because that reflects the sun best.

808
00:33:59,040 --> 00:34:02,000
 And they were designed specifically for anyone on the water,

809
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:04,400
 because of the glare of the water.

810
00:34:04,400 --> 00:34:08,240
 So all gondoliers had these like, um, Wizard of Oz type glasses.

811
00:34:08,240 --> 00:34:08,880
 How cool.

812
00:34:08,880 --> 00:34:09,440
 So cool.

813
00:34:09,440 --> 00:34:11,600
 There was that thing about Plenty of the Elder as well.

814
00:34:11,600 --> 00:34:14,400
 Wasn't there just talking about green tinted glasses,

815
00:34:14,400 --> 00:34:19,680
 where he said, well, he wrote that the Emperor Nero would watch Gladiator matches through emeralds.

816
00:34:19,680 --> 00:34:22,320
 Which it seems really far from.

817
00:34:22,320 --> 00:34:24,560
 Yeah, it sounds like he's never seen an emerald.

818
00:34:24,560 --> 00:34:28,480
 I mean, what would the possible point be?

819
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:30,800
 Um, oh, hey, maybe Nero was doing it,

820
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:34,160
 because I know a physical effect that wearing sunglasses has.

821
00:34:34,160 --> 00:34:35,360
 It makes your heart smaller.

822
00:34:35,360 --> 00:34:37,200
 Does it?

823
00:34:37,200 --> 00:34:38,000
 Not literally.

824
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:41,920
 Oh, well, it makes you give less money to just giving.

825
00:34:41,920 --> 00:34:42,720
 Yeah, it does.

826
00:34:42,720 --> 00:34:45,840
 Oh, that makes sense, because it sort of removes you from a situation.

827
00:34:45,840 --> 00:34:46,800
 This is my guess.

828
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:48,400
 That is the answer.

829
00:34:48,400 --> 00:34:52,000
 Yeah, it makes you a bit more anonymous, not completely anonymous.

830
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:55,920
 But if you're more anonymous, you are less inhibited,

831
00:34:55,920 --> 00:34:59,440
 basically, from giving away to your selfish base instincts.

832
00:34:59,440 --> 00:35:02,080
 And so they did an experiment at the University of Toronto.

833
00:35:02,080 --> 00:35:06,000
 They got 80 volunteers and they said, right, we're going to give you six dollars,

834
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:08,080
 not a life-changing sum of money.

835
00:35:08,080 --> 00:35:12,240
 And we want you to split it with someone else who's in the next room, let's say.

836
00:35:12,240 --> 00:35:15,280
 And half of the people they did were just with, you know, nude face,

837
00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:17,280
 and half of them were wearing sunglasses.

838
00:35:17,280 --> 00:35:20,880
 And people who were nude face, panic.

839
00:35:21,680 --> 00:35:24,560
 People who were in nude face.

840
00:35:24,560 --> 00:35:26,720
 Oh, actually, they weren't even in nude face.

841
00:35:26,720 --> 00:35:28,320
 I think they were wearing normal glasses.

842
00:35:28,320 --> 00:35:29,120
 What's going on?

843
00:35:29,120 --> 00:35:33,360
 Are these are these all you two songs that I've never heard of?

844
00:35:33,360 --> 00:35:37,360
 It sounds like you're really shoehorn in some weird words into these sentences.

845
00:35:37,360 --> 00:35:39,680
 Have you never heard their hit album, Nude Face?

846
00:35:39,680 --> 00:35:41,680
 Oh, my God, James, it's a revelation.

847
00:35:41,680 --> 00:35:43,520
 He's the bass player, I thought.

848
00:35:43,520 --> 00:35:47,280
 Basically, people who were wearing clear lenses,

849
00:35:47,280 --> 00:35:52,480
 so more identifiable, they gave away $2.71 of the six dollars they've been given.

850
00:35:52,480 --> 00:35:54,880
 So pretty nearly even Stevens, on average.

851
00:35:54,880 --> 00:35:58,080
 People in shades gave away only $1.81.

852
00:35:58,080 --> 00:36:01,200
 So they get more than four of the six dollars for themselves.

853
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:04,960
 So that indicates that people are more willing to be a bit more selfish

854
00:36:04,960 --> 00:36:07,680
 if they are hidden and anonymous in sunglasses.

855
00:36:07,680 --> 00:36:08,720
 Makes total sense.

856
00:36:08,720 --> 00:36:13,680
 You know, when you see like a fashionable, wealthy looking lady wearing huge

857
00:36:13,680 --> 00:36:16,960
 Audrey Hepburn style sunglasses, you do kind of think, I bet you're a dig.

858
00:36:17,920 --> 00:36:20,320
 Turns out, they are.

859
00:36:20,320 --> 00:36:21,840
 But then when they take the glasses off,

860
00:36:21,840 --> 00:36:23,760
 they magically transform into a nice person again.

861
00:36:23,760 --> 00:36:24,720
 Is that right?

862
00:36:24,720 --> 00:36:25,440
 Yeah.

863
00:36:25,440 --> 00:36:28,720
 You know, he's not a dick who a lot of people thought was a dick for wearing glasses.

864
00:36:28,720 --> 00:36:30,720
 Bono, from you two.

865
00:36:30,720 --> 00:36:31,040
 No.

866
00:36:31,040 --> 00:36:37,040
 Bono, very famously, wears glasses indoors, everywhere, never has them off.

867
00:36:37,040 --> 00:36:40,000
 But it turns out, and he revealed this on the Graham Norton show back in, I think,

868
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:44,320
 it was 2017, that he has them on permanently because of a medical condition.

869
00:36:45,280 --> 00:36:47,600
 Yeah. So he suffers from glaucoma.

870
00:36:47,600 --> 00:36:51,200
 And it means that his eyes, if there's too much light in them,

871
00:36:51,200 --> 00:36:56,000
 swell up massively and can have huge problems, loss of eyesight, long term.

872
00:36:56,000 --> 00:37:00,080
 And so for someone who plays stadium gigs and is constantly having

873
00:37:00,080 --> 00:37:03,840
 lights flashing in front of him, he could have been blind many, many years ago.

874
00:37:03,840 --> 00:37:07,200
 So that's the simple reason why he wears the glasses.

875
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:08,880
 Everyone thought he was being a dick.

876
00:37:08,880 --> 00:37:11,520
 Well, why didn't you tell us all 20, 30 years ago,

877
00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:14,000
 before you let us all make fools of ourselves, taking a piss out of him?

878
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:14,880
 Because he's a rock star.

879
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:16,160
 He needs to come across as a dick.

880
00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:17,760
 Oh, yeah, fair enough.

881
00:37:17,760 --> 00:37:18,640
 The cash 20, too.

882
00:37:18,640 --> 00:37:21,440
 Does glaucoma come on more as you get older as well?

883
00:37:21,440 --> 00:37:25,520
 So maybe he was a dick and he's just now a dick with an excuse.

884
00:37:25,520 --> 00:37:27,120
 Wow.

885
00:37:27,120 --> 00:37:28,080
 Also going there.

886
00:37:28,080 --> 00:37:30,000
 Possibly, I don't know.

887
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:30,880
 Possibly.

888
00:37:30,880 --> 00:37:31,360
 I don't know.

889
00:37:31,360 --> 00:37:33,360
 You know Ray Ban.

890
00:37:33,360 --> 00:37:34,320
 Yeah.

891
00:37:34,320 --> 00:37:41,440
 And Armani and Bulgari and Burberry and Chanel and Dolce and Gabana and Prada and Versace.

892
00:37:42,240 --> 00:37:48,880
 And Sunglasses Hut and Oakley and Target Optical and pretty much every kind of sunglasses you can name.

893
00:37:48,880 --> 00:37:56,320
 They're all owned by the same people, by the Luxot Teacher Group, which is an Italian group.

894
00:37:56,320 --> 00:38:05,040
 They sell about a billion pairs of lenses and frames every year on all these different brand names.

895
00:38:05,040 --> 00:38:08,800
 So some of them they own and some of them they make the sunglasses for the company

896
00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:10,240
 that is owned by someone else.

897
00:38:10,960 --> 00:38:15,120
 And this company is owned by a guy called Leonardo Delvecchio,

898
00:38:15,120 --> 00:38:18,000
 who was the son of a vegetable peddler.

899
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:23,440
 And he was sent to an orphanage at age seven because his mother was widowed

900
00:38:23,440 --> 00:38:26,160
 and couldn't afford to support all of her children.

901
00:38:26,160 --> 00:38:31,040
 And then when he became a teenager, he started working at a car parts place.

902
00:38:31,040 --> 00:38:34,320
 And then at the age of 14, he put himself through design school.

903
00:38:34,320 --> 00:38:36,880
 And now he's the second richest man in the whole of Italy.

904
00:38:36,880 --> 00:38:38,080
 Wow.

905
00:38:38,080 --> 00:38:38,800
 Wow.

906
00:38:38,800 --> 00:38:39,360
 Yeah.

907
00:38:39,360 --> 00:38:39,840
 God.

908
00:38:39,840 --> 00:38:40,560
 That's extraordinary.

909
00:38:40,560 --> 00:38:41,520
 Amazing.

910
00:38:41,520 --> 00:38:43,920
 Sounds like they just had a big brainstorm coming up with names.

911
00:38:43,920 --> 00:38:45,440
 Couldn't decide to use all of them.

912
00:38:45,440 --> 00:38:50,320
 And then why not just sell the one brand?

913
00:38:50,320 --> 00:38:51,040
 It's confusing.

914
00:38:51,040 --> 00:38:51,920
 One a bit of variety.

915
00:38:51,920 --> 00:38:53,600
 I like sunglasses hut best of all.

916
00:38:53,600 --> 00:38:54,880
 All right.

917
00:38:54,880 --> 00:38:55,920
 Well, what about Ray?

918
00:38:55,920 --> 00:38:58,000
 Do you know where the name Ray band comes from?

919
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:03,520
 I assumed there was a Ray involved, as in it was like Max Factor,

920
00:39:03,520 --> 00:39:04,480
 who was a real person, wasn't he?

921
00:39:04,480 --> 00:39:05,200
 Max Factor was real.

922
00:39:05,200 --> 00:39:06,240
 So I assumed that there was a Ray band.

923
00:39:06,240 --> 00:39:09,360
 It was called Maximilian Factorovich or something.

924
00:39:09,360 --> 00:39:10,160
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

925
00:39:10,160 --> 00:39:10,880
 That's right.

926
00:39:10,880 --> 00:39:14,080
 So I assumed it was Raymond Banneveld or whatever.

927
00:39:14,080 --> 00:39:15,840
 Did you not do what I did, Andy, which is think,

928
00:39:15,840 --> 00:39:18,880
 I literally went through that exact process thinking,

929
00:39:18,880 --> 00:39:21,040
 Ray band, I wonder if there's a Ray band,

930
00:39:21,040 --> 00:39:23,760
 and then you get three seconds into that thought and you go,

931
00:39:23,760 --> 00:39:25,680
 Oh no, wait, they banish rays.

932
00:39:25,680 --> 00:39:27,440
 I never got to that second part of the process.

933
00:39:27,440 --> 00:39:28,400
 There you go.

934
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:32,000
 But they did the, they did those big aviators glasses, didn't they?

935
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:33,520
 Was it, was that Ray band?

936
00:39:33,520 --> 00:39:34,000
 I think so.

937
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:34,480
 Yeah.

938
00:39:34,480 --> 00:39:34,800
 Yeah.

939
00:39:34,800 --> 00:39:35,760
 Yeah, invented the aviators.

940
00:39:35,760 --> 00:39:38,240
 They were designed by a guy called John McCready.

941
00:39:38,240 --> 00:39:43,600
 And John McCready, as well as designing these aviator sunglasses,

942
00:39:43,600 --> 00:39:48,160
 he was the first person to test fly a crop duster airplane.

943
00:39:48,160 --> 00:39:54,720
 He set three altitude records flying up to 35,000 feet-ish,

944
00:39:54,720 --> 00:39:56,400
 the first person to do that.

945
00:39:56,400 --> 00:40:01,200
 He set the world endurance record of flying for over 35 hours,

946
00:40:01,200 --> 00:40:02,960
 35 hours and 18 minutes.

947
00:40:02,960 --> 00:40:07,280
 He made the first non-stop coast-to-coast flight across America.

948
00:40:07,280 --> 00:40:12,400
 And he did the first aircraft engine repair while it was flying.

949
00:40:12,400 --> 00:40:14,640
 So replaying an engine while the plane was flying.

950
00:40:14,640 --> 00:40:15,200
 Oh, wow.

951
00:40:15,200 --> 00:40:20,400
 And he became the first ever pilot to bail out of an aircraft at night.

952
00:40:20,400 --> 00:40:24,480
 He did all those things and the invented or designed the aviator sunglasses.

953
00:40:24,480 --> 00:40:26,320
 It's amazing.

954
00:40:26,320 --> 00:40:31,360
 There's such a terrifying story about when he did break the altitude record,

955
00:40:31,360 --> 00:40:33,600
 which is that his friend was actually trying to break it.

956
00:40:33,600 --> 00:40:35,120
 A guy called Shorty Schroeder.

957
00:40:35,120 --> 00:40:36,960
 This was in 1920.

958
00:40:36,960 --> 00:40:42,480
 And this guy went up and at the time before they had your aviator sunglasses,

959
00:40:42,480 --> 00:40:43,280
 they wore goggles.

960
00:40:43,280 --> 00:40:45,920
 And because they were going up so high and it was incredibly cold,

961
00:40:45,920 --> 00:40:51,040
 like minus 50 degrees, they wore goggles with fur lining.

962
00:40:51,040 --> 00:40:53,600
 And if your eye was even a split second exposed,

963
00:40:53,600 --> 00:40:56,480
 then you're absolutely buggered because it's far too cold for an eye to survive.

964
00:40:56,480 --> 00:41:00,080
 So this guy Shorty went up and his goggles completely fogged up

965
00:41:00,080 --> 00:41:01,520
 so he couldn't see a thing.

966
00:41:01,520 --> 00:41:04,480
 And he had no choice except to rip them off his face so he could see.

967
00:41:04,480 --> 00:41:06,960
 And within moments, his vision went really blurred

968
00:41:06,960 --> 00:41:09,120
 and his eyes completely froze over.

969
00:41:09,120 --> 00:41:11,840
 So my God.

970
00:41:11,840 --> 00:41:13,600
 All the liquid in his eyes froze.

971
00:41:13,600 --> 00:41:15,520
 Somehow his eyeballs frozen.

972
00:41:15,520 --> 00:41:17,600
 He managed to land and it was John McReady,

973
00:41:17,600 --> 00:41:19,920
 his friend who pulled him out of the cockpit and said,

974
00:41:19,920 --> 00:41:23,280
 "All right, mate. Nice try. Bad luck about the goggles."

975
00:41:23,280 --> 00:41:24,640
 Then he broke the record.

976
00:41:24,640 --> 00:41:27,840
 Then he went and found the sunglasses manufacturers and went right.

977
00:41:27,840 --> 00:41:28,960
 We better make some better glasses.

978
00:41:28,960 --> 00:41:29,840
 That's amazing.

979
00:41:29,840 --> 00:41:33,600
 Because I was just thinking, like quite often when I talk to people,

980
00:41:33,600 --> 00:41:35,280
 their eyes just kind of glaze over.

981
00:41:35,280 --> 00:41:38,320
 And I wonder if it's due to the temperature perhaps.

982
00:41:38,320 --> 00:41:39,760
 That's what it is, James.

983
00:41:39,760 --> 00:41:42,000
 It's the lofty, lofty conversation you have, James.

984
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:44,400
 It simulates the altitude of 35,000 feet.

985
00:41:44,400 --> 00:41:45,120
 It's incredible.

986
00:41:45,120 --> 00:41:51,360
 You know, do you know progressive lenses in glasses?

987
00:41:51,360 --> 00:41:57,440
 What these are, you can have bifocals where half of them are for short-sighted

988
00:41:57,440 --> 00:41:58,720
 and half of them are for long-sighted.

989
00:41:58,720 --> 00:42:00,480
 And you look in different parts of your glasses

990
00:42:00,480 --> 00:42:04,800
 and you can, depending on what you're looking at, a progressive lens.

991
00:42:04,800 --> 00:42:08,480
 It still has your short-sighted bits and your long-sighted bits,

992
00:42:08,480 --> 00:42:10,640
 but they're kind of blended into each other.

993
00:42:10,640 --> 00:42:12,560
 So you're never jumping from one to the other.

994
00:42:12,560 --> 00:42:17,760
 And the first US patent for one of these was by a woman called Dr. Estelle Glancy.

995
00:42:17,760 --> 00:42:20,400
 And she, as well as invented that.

996
00:42:20,400 --> 00:42:23,280
 Oh, yeah, Glancy.

997
00:42:23,280 --> 00:42:24,560
 I thought that was the whole point.

998
00:42:24,560 --> 00:42:25,760
 Yeah, I thought that was the point.

999
00:42:25,760 --> 00:42:26,560
 That's the point.

1000
00:42:26,560 --> 00:42:28,720
 You know what?

1001
00:42:28,720 --> 00:42:32,240
 I mean, so many of my facts are just this person's got a funny name.

1002
00:42:32,240 --> 00:42:34,800
 I do see why you thought that was the end of it.

1003
00:42:34,800 --> 00:42:38,320
 But she also invented the first lens testing machine.

1004
00:42:38,320 --> 00:42:41,360
 And that is still used in most opticians today, her invention.

1005
00:42:41,360 --> 00:42:47,840
 And from 1918 to 1950, when she worked in the industry,

1006
00:42:47,840 --> 00:42:54,320
 she was the only female lens designer in the whole world for 32 years.

1007
00:42:54,320 --> 00:42:55,840
 She was the only one.

1008
00:42:55,840 --> 00:42:57,520
 Everyone else who did it was a man.

1009
00:42:57,520 --> 00:43:03,040
 And on the website for Zeiss, who's like a kind of an optical company,

1010
00:43:03,040 --> 00:43:06,400
 they said that women have faced a glass ceiling in many fields,

1011
00:43:06,400 --> 00:43:10,240
 but the glass ceiling in glasses may have been the toughest to break through.

1012
00:43:10,240 --> 00:43:11,760
 Brilliant.

1013
00:43:11,760 --> 00:43:12,720
 There's a great line, isn't there?

1014
00:43:12,720 --> 00:43:16,480
 But now women make up more than 76% of opticians in the US.

1015
00:43:16,480 --> 00:43:18,880
 So it's gotten better, certainly.

1016
00:43:18,880 --> 00:43:19,760
 We've made it.

1017
00:43:19,760 --> 00:43:20,800
 I'm really cool.

1018
00:43:20,800 --> 00:43:22,480
 Progressive lens sounds like a lens.

1019
00:43:22,480 --> 00:43:24,960
 That only lets you read The Guardian and the New Statesman or something.

1020
00:43:24,960 --> 00:43:26,000
 Yeah, that's nice.

1021
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:27,200
 I've won Tiny.

1022
00:43:27,200 --> 00:43:31,680
 This just made me laugh because it's to do with one of my favorite movies, Contact.

1023
00:43:31,680 --> 00:43:35,200
 Contact the movie, Jodie Foster.

1024
00:43:35,200 --> 00:43:39,600
 Almost got a really bizarre review from this guy called Anthony Lane,

1025
00:43:39,600 --> 00:43:44,400
 who is an American reviewer, because he was running really late to the cinema.

1026
00:43:44,400 --> 00:43:48,400
 And when he ran in and sat down, he forgot to take his sunglasses off.

1027
00:43:48,400 --> 00:43:51,920
 So he watched the first three quarters of an hour with the glasses on.

1028
00:43:51,920 --> 00:43:56,080
 And the notes that he looked back on were notes going, "Very gloomy this movie.

1029
00:43:56,080 --> 00:43:59,520
 Odd noir look for sci-fi.

1030
00:43:59,520 --> 00:44:02,560
 Creepy shadows in the outdoor seats."

1031
00:44:02,560 --> 00:44:06,160
 And then suddenly realized he had his sunnies on.

1032
00:44:06,160 --> 00:44:08,640
 He was wearing contact lenses.

1033
00:44:08,640 --> 00:44:10,000
 Very good.

1034
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:12,560
 Oh, okay.

1035
00:44:12,560 --> 00:44:15,920
 Got to move it on.

1036
00:44:15,920 --> 00:44:21,520
 So I read a fun story from 2017 about sunglasses, specifically that police caught a man

1037
00:44:21,520 --> 00:44:26,320
 on his phone at the wheel because he took a selfie of himself of his face.

1038
00:44:26,320 --> 00:44:28,640
 He's wearing sunglasses and the selfie says something like,

1039
00:44:28,640 --> 00:44:31,440
 "Single today, married tomorrow, scary times."

1040
00:44:31,440 --> 00:44:33,040
 Something really cool like that.

1041
00:44:33,040 --> 00:44:35,920
 And he tweeted this.

1042
00:44:35,920 --> 00:44:39,440
 And the police in his area spotted that in the photograph,

1043
00:44:39,440 --> 00:44:43,600
 there was the reflection in his sunglasses of his other hand on the wheel of a car

1044
00:44:43,600 --> 00:44:46,640
 and the reflection of the view through the windscreen showing that he was mid-driving

1045
00:44:46,640 --> 00:44:47,680
 on a dual carriageway.

1046
00:44:49,600 --> 00:44:53,280
 Twisted at him, said, "We've got a wedding present for you and it's a £200 fine

1047
00:44:53,280 --> 00:44:54,640
 and six points on your license."

1048
00:44:54,640 --> 00:44:56,080
 They tweeted it back.

1049
00:44:56,080 --> 00:44:58,560
 They tweeted him that and then he deleted his Twitter account.

1050
00:44:58,560 --> 00:44:58,960
 So that's bad.

1051
00:44:58,960 --> 00:45:01,840
 No one comes across well in that story, do they?

1052
00:45:01,840 --> 00:45:03,840
 I don't think the police come across that well.

1053
00:45:03,840 --> 00:45:06,240
 And obviously he's driving while selfying.

1054
00:45:06,240 --> 00:45:07,120
 So I just think...

1055
00:45:07,120 --> 00:45:09,520
 What you think of the police, that was a little bit.

1056
00:45:09,520 --> 00:45:10,800
 Don't do it over Twitter, guys.

1057
00:45:10,800 --> 00:45:12,240
 Don't do it over Twitter.

1058
00:45:12,240 --> 00:45:15,440
 Yeah, kick the door in like traditional, you know.

1059
00:45:15,440 --> 00:45:27,120
 Okay, it is time for our final fact of the show and that is James.

1060
00:45:27,120 --> 00:45:31,600
 Okay, my fact this week is that there is a species of rabbit that can't hop.

1061
00:45:31,600 --> 00:45:36,480
 So if it wants to go fast, it walks on its hands with its legs in the air.

1062
00:45:36,480 --> 00:45:41,600
 Oh, I love these guys.

1063
00:45:41,600 --> 00:45:42,560
 They're so cute.

1064
00:45:44,400 --> 00:45:46,800
 You might have seen them online in the last couple of weeks.

1065
00:45:46,800 --> 00:45:49,840
 They've done a mini viral thing on the internet.

1066
00:45:49,840 --> 00:45:52,320
 Hopefully not too viral that some of you won't have heard of it.

1067
00:45:52,320 --> 00:45:59,440
 But this is a species of rabbit called Sauter d'Alfort or the Alfort Jumper.

1068
00:45:59,440 --> 00:46:01,280
 And they're a French species of rabbit.

1069
00:46:01,280 --> 00:46:06,080
 And very recently, the reason they've got in the news is because there is a guy

1070
00:46:06,080 --> 00:46:10,800
 called Leif Anderson and his team at Uppsala University in Sweden.

1071
00:46:10,800 --> 00:46:16,640
 And they have worked out what the gene is that makes it unable to hop like normal rabbits.

1072
00:46:16,640 --> 00:46:19,280
 So it's kind of a genetic problem they've got, isn't it?

1073
00:46:19,280 --> 00:46:20,560
 It's sort of quirky.

1074
00:46:20,560 --> 00:46:23,280
 Yeah, do they get preyed on more, I wonder?

1075
00:46:23,280 --> 00:46:26,240
 Because they can't go that fast, maybe?

1076
00:46:26,240 --> 00:46:29,840
 They tend to not live in the wild very much.

1077
00:46:29,840 --> 00:46:34,400
 So the first we found out about them, there was a French vet called Etienne Leta.

1078
00:46:34,400 --> 00:46:39,360
 And he was studying these rabbits that were unable to jump properly.

1079
00:46:40,240 --> 00:46:44,480
 And he was breeding rabbits at the time and he'd bred a few together.

1080
00:46:44,480 --> 00:46:47,600
 And this strain had come out, which did this weird thing.

1081
00:46:47,600 --> 00:46:51,840
 He said that they moved exactly like a human tightrope walker walks on his hands.

1082
00:46:51,840 --> 00:46:55,120
 So he kind of saw that association then.

1083
00:46:55,120 --> 00:46:57,680
 But the thing is, this is a very much recessive gene.

1084
00:46:57,680 --> 00:47:04,880
 So I think some might have escaped and some completely healthy ones have mated.

1085
00:47:04,880 --> 00:47:07,360
 And now you get some of them in the wild that do this.

1086
00:47:07,360 --> 00:47:10,000
 But again, they won't really last very long, I don't think.

1087
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:13,680
 If they did that, it's really impressive, isn't it?

1088
00:47:13,680 --> 00:47:15,840
 Yeah, it's kind of very cool seeing them handstand the way along.

1089
00:47:15,840 --> 00:47:17,120
 It's kind of awesome.

1090
00:47:17,120 --> 00:47:18,160
 Oh, it's so wicked.

1091
00:47:18,160 --> 00:47:18,480
 Yeah.

1092
00:47:18,480 --> 00:47:20,640
 And actually, he's quite interested in Etienne Leta.

1093
00:47:20,640 --> 00:47:26,000
 His father, Klebert Leta, was the first person to perform

1094
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:28,800
 artificial insemination of a horse in France.

1095
00:47:28,800 --> 00:47:34,640
 Etienne was the first, did the first public demonstration

1096
00:47:34,640 --> 00:47:36,960
 of insemination of a cow in France.

1097
00:47:37,760 --> 00:47:39,680
 Is that a step up or a step down?

1098
00:47:39,680 --> 00:47:40,880
 I can't remember.

1099
00:47:40,880 --> 00:47:43,280
 Public, that's kind of, it's more showbiz, isn't it?

1100
00:47:43,280 --> 00:47:43,840
 It is.

1101
00:47:43,840 --> 00:47:47,920
 Yeah, he took his father's ponchant for insemination

1102
00:47:47,920 --> 00:47:49,840
 and he made himself a star.

1103
00:47:49,840 --> 00:47:51,680
 Gave it a bit of the old razzle dazzle.

1104
00:47:51,680 --> 00:47:52,080
 Yeah.

1105
00:47:52,080 --> 00:47:55,360
 I wonder if that's a hard show to get people to come to.

1106
00:47:55,360 --> 00:47:57,600
 You know in Edinburgh, when you're walking through and everyone says,

1107
00:47:57,600 --> 00:48:00,800
 "Come, we've got naked Shakespeare," or, you know, "Come to..."

1108
00:48:00,800 --> 00:48:02,000
 "Come one, come all!"

1109
00:48:05,360 --> 00:48:08,320
 Does anyone, you guys might not know this,

1110
00:48:08,320 --> 00:48:11,040
 but have you ever heard of the song, "Run, Rabbit, Run"?

1111
00:48:11,040 --> 00:48:12,560
 Oh, yeah.

1112
00:48:12,560 --> 00:48:15,360
 "Run, Rabbit, Run, Rabbit, Run, Run, Run, Run."

1113
00:48:15,360 --> 00:48:18,640
 "Gum's a farmer with his gum, gum, gum."

1114
00:48:18,640 --> 00:48:21,360
 "Bang, bang, bang, goes the farmer's gum."

1115
00:48:21,360 --> 00:48:22,160
 So, "Run, run."

1116
00:48:22,160 --> 00:48:22,800
 Sorry, go on.

1117
00:48:22,800 --> 00:48:23,600
 What were you going to say about it?

1118
00:48:23,600 --> 00:48:26,800
 Is that a nursery rhyme or is that a big hit in the UK?

1119
00:48:26,800 --> 00:48:28,960
 It was a big hit back in the day.

1120
00:48:28,960 --> 00:48:30,240
 Flanagan and Alan sang it.

1121
00:48:30,240 --> 00:48:32,000
 It was written by Noel Gay.

1122
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:35,120
 And it became a patriotic song

1123
00:48:35,120 --> 00:48:40,320
 in World War II, where they sang "Run, Adolf, Run, Adolf, Run, Run, Run" instead.

1124
00:48:40,320 --> 00:48:44,080
 And the reason that they got that song for World War II

1125
00:48:44,080 --> 00:48:47,120
 is because there was a picture that was in all the newspapers

1126
00:48:47,120 --> 00:48:50,400
 of this big sort of crater where a bum had landed

1127
00:48:50,400 --> 00:48:53,280
 and someone was holding two rabbits and said,

1128
00:48:53,280 --> 00:48:55,200
 "Ha, ha, Hitler, you bummed us,

1129
00:48:55,200 --> 00:48:57,520
 but all you managed to kill was these two rabbits."

1130
00:48:57,520 --> 00:49:00,720
 But actually, that was a setup, that picture.

1131
00:49:00,720 --> 00:49:04,240
 And the rabbits had been bought by nearby butchers

1132
00:49:04,240 --> 00:49:07,280
 and they'd gone to the hole in the ground and held them up.

1133
00:49:07,280 --> 00:49:10,800
 And it was basically a bit of propaganda.

1134
00:49:10,800 --> 00:49:13,280
 But then, as a result, this "Run, Rabbit, Run" song

1135
00:49:13,280 --> 00:49:15,200
 became massive during World War II.

1136
00:49:15,200 --> 00:49:15,920
 How interesting.

1137
00:49:15,920 --> 00:49:18,640
 Because I have seen that as a fact around the internet

1138
00:49:18,640 --> 00:49:21,760
 that the first casualty of World War II to a bum was a rabbit.

1139
00:49:21,760 --> 00:49:22,320
 I think it was.

1140
00:49:22,320 --> 00:49:23,360
 And it was a specific incident.

1141
00:49:23,360 --> 00:49:24,480
 Or is this a different incident, Anna?

1142
00:49:24,480 --> 00:49:25,680
 No, no, it's the same incident.

1143
00:49:25,680 --> 00:49:29,440
 It's kind of propaganda, but it's just to tell a true story.

1144
00:49:29,440 --> 00:49:31,440
 Because I believe, bizarrely, the first bum dropped

1145
00:49:31,440 --> 00:49:32,800
 was on the Shetland Islands,

1146
00:49:32,800 --> 00:49:36,080
 because it was the Germans trying to get some of the boats

1147
00:49:36,080 --> 00:49:38,320
 in an inlet around the Shetland.

1148
00:49:38,320 --> 00:49:41,440
 And what happened was, a few landed on the land

1149
00:49:41,440 --> 00:49:43,920
 and one of them killed a rabbit.

1150
00:49:43,920 --> 00:49:44,880
 Like, all the locals were like,

1151
00:49:44,880 --> 00:49:47,360
 "Oh, God, this is a big crater, this poor rabbit's dead."

1152
00:49:47,360 --> 00:49:49,520
 And there was a photographer who lived on the island

1153
00:49:49,520 --> 00:49:52,000
 who was like, "Oh, brilliant, I'm going to go and photograph that."

1154
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:55,760
 But he's a smart cookie and has an eye for a good bit of press.

1155
00:49:55,760 --> 00:49:57,440
 And so he went to the butcher on the way

1156
00:49:57,440 --> 00:49:59,280
 to buy some rabbits to hold up,

1157
00:49:59,280 --> 00:50:00,480
 because he knew that that rabbit

1158
00:50:00,480 --> 00:50:01,840
 was going to be blown to smithereens.

1159
00:50:01,840 --> 00:50:03,200
 You know what you're saying, Anna, but I don't think you can...

1160
00:50:03,200 --> 00:50:04,400
 And then he said that that's why.

1161
00:50:04,400 --> 00:50:06,720
 I don't think you can claim your Pulitzer Prize

1162
00:50:06,720 --> 00:50:10,800
 if you're going buying crops for your war photos, can you?

1163
00:50:10,800 --> 00:50:11,200
 Yeah.

1164
00:50:11,200 --> 00:50:13,200
 Oh, come on.

1165
00:50:13,200 --> 00:50:17,520
 It was a bit of dramatic artistic license in the face of...

1166
00:50:17,520 --> 00:50:20,080
 Because you can't hold up the sort of butchered remains.

1167
00:50:20,080 --> 00:50:21,120
 You have to have some rabbits, no.

1168
00:50:21,120 --> 00:50:21,360
 Yeah.

1169
00:50:21,360 --> 00:50:23,920
 So was there any...

1170
00:50:23,920 --> 00:50:26,560
 Do we have a photo that's sort of like in the archives

1171
00:50:26,560 --> 00:50:27,600
 of the butchered rabbit?

1172
00:50:27,600 --> 00:50:29,520
 Or did someone did some farm ago,

1173
00:50:29,520 --> 00:50:32,240
 "I'm down one rabbit. It must have landed on that."

1174
00:50:32,240 --> 00:50:33,280
 That's a good point.

1175
00:50:33,280 --> 00:50:34,240
 It's a big claim.

1176
00:50:34,240 --> 00:50:35,360
 Did it land on the hutch,

1177
00:50:35,360 --> 00:50:37,520
 or was it just a loose rabbit in a field?

1178
00:50:37,520 --> 00:50:40,640
 And we presume that it lost its life in the...

1179
00:50:40,640 --> 00:50:42,240
 But also, starting with the Shetlands,

1180
00:50:42,240 --> 00:50:44,000
 feels like a very toe in the water strategy

1181
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:45,040
 for your bobbin campaign.

1182
00:50:45,040 --> 00:50:49,440
 I have a plain and rabbit-related fact,

1183
00:50:49,440 --> 00:50:50,640
 which is that in 2017,

1184
00:50:50,640 --> 00:50:52,480
 a plane had to make an emergency landing

1185
00:50:52,480 --> 00:50:54,320
 that was flying between Melbourne and Brisbane.

1186
00:50:54,320 --> 00:50:55,760
 It had to make an emergency landing

1187
00:50:55,760 --> 00:50:58,160
 after it hit an eagle and a rabbit at the same time.

1188
00:50:58,800 --> 00:51:00,720
 Oh, wow.

1189
00:51:00,720 --> 00:51:02,880
 It was the eagle that had caught the rabbit,

1190
00:51:02,880 --> 00:51:04,160
 and it was flying up into the air,

1191
00:51:04,160 --> 00:51:05,520
 and it failed to notice.

1192
00:51:05,520 --> 00:51:06,800
 It was so intent on its lunch

1193
00:51:06,800 --> 00:51:09,600
 that it failed to notice the plane bearing down on it.

1194
00:51:09,600 --> 00:51:10,800
 Same questions about that.

1195
00:51:10,800 --> 00:51:13,200
 You're flying your plane,

1196
00:51:13,200 --> 00:51:15,760
 and I guess you could see an eagle,

1197
00:51:15,760 --> 00:51:16,640
 but you're so fast

1198
00:51:16,640 --> 00:51:18,400
 that you're going to collide really quick, right?

1199
00:51:18,400 --> 00:51:20,560
 How do we know there was a rabbit there?

1200
00:51:20,560 --> 00:51:22,320
 It's such a good question.

1201
00:51:22,320 --> 00:51:24,320
 I just don't see how the pilot could have seen.

1202
00:51:24,320 --> 00:51:27,120
 I don't think we're relying on the pilot's testimony.

1203
00:51:27,120 --> 00:51:29,120
 I think they must have found some fur in the engine.

1204
00:51:29,120 --> 00:51:32,080
 Do you think someone went to the Butchers

1205
00:51:32,080 --> 00:51:33,040
 after the plane landed?

1206
00:51:33,040 --> 00:51:37,760
 There's one Butcher who's doing very well.

1207
00:51:37,760 --> 00:51:41,600
 I have dodgy journalists.

1208
00:51:41,600 --> 00:51:46,240
 Do you know that the big reveal of the Simpsons

1209
00:51:46,240 --> 00:51:49,120
 was meant to be that Marge Simpson was a massive rabbit?

1210
00:51:49,120 --> 00:51:51,680
 What are you talking about?

1211
00:51:51,680 --> 00:51:54,880
 Yeah, this is a thing Matt Groening really wanted to do,

1212
00:51:54,880 --> 00:51:58,880
 which was he had a previous comic strip called Life in Hell,

1213
00:51:58,880 --> 00:52:00,240
 which was about a bunch of rabbits.

1214
00:52:00,240 --> 00:52:03,920
 Yeah, and it was a very popular comic strip for him,

1215
00:52:03,920 --> 00:52:07,440
 and then the Simpsons became the big thing that he did.

1216
00:52:07,440 --> 00:52:10,480
 But his big idea, which he pitched in a few meetings,

1217
00:52:10,480 --> 00:52:14,160
 was that underneath the giant blue hair

1218
00:52:14,160 --> 00:52:16,960
 that would one day get wet would come down

1219
00:52:16,960 --> 00:52:20,480
 and revealed underneath would be two giant bunny rabbit ears,

1220
00:52:20,480 --> 00:52:23,600
 and we would be shown that that universe was connected

1221
00:52:23,600 --> 00:52:25,280
 to the Life is Hell universe.

1222
00:52:25,280 --> 00:52:27,440
 And everyone told he was mad and not to do it

1223
00:52:27,440 --> 00:52:28,640
 because he was going to do an episode.

1224
00:52:28,640 --> 00:52:30,400
 Then he thought that's the long game.

1225
00:52:30,400 --> 00:52:32,240
 We could do this as the final reveal.

1226
00:52:32,240 --> 00:52:34,080
 So he was a massive rabbit all along.

1227
00:52:34,080 --> 00:52:35,200
 Still waiting.

1228
00:52:35,200 --> 00:52:36,800
 We're still waiting for that final reveal.

1229
00:52:36,800 --> 00:52:37,680
 They talked about it.

1230
00:52:37,680 --> 00:52:40,160
 He said in a DVD commentary that it's an old idea.

1231
00:52:40,160 --> 00:52:43,280
 However, there was a video game that was released of the Simpsons

1232
00:52:43,280 --> 00:52:46,400
 where in it, Marge gets electrocuted.

1233
00:52:46,400 --> 00:52:48,880
 And you know that classic cartoon thing of electrocution

1234
00:52:48,880 --> 00:52:52,160
 where you see the skeleton come through or the body underneath?

1235
00:52:52,160 --> 00:52:54,000
 In it, when she gets electrocuted,

1236
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:57,280
 it sort of shows she has massive bunny rabbit ears.

1237
00:52:57,280 --> 00:53:01,120
 So for one instance, she was in one part of the Simpsons universe.

1238
00:53:01,120 --> 00:53:02,480
 She is a giant rabbit.

1239
00:53:02,480 --> 00:53:04,640
 And that is a classic Easter egg, isn't it?

1240
00:53:04,640 --> 00:53:06,080
 Brilliant.

1241
00:53:06,080 --> 00:53:06,480
 Lovely.

1242
00:53:06,480 --> 00:53:09,680
 I know my tech terms.

1243
00:53:09,680 --> 00:53:12,720
 Rabbits are very stoic.

1244
00:53:12,720 --> 00:53:16,960
 Didn't know this, but yeah.

1245
00:53:16,960 --> 00:53:20,720
 So Rabbits, if they're really ill, they don't let you know.

1246
00:53:20,720 --> 00:53:22,560
 So many rabbit owners, when their rabbits died,

1247
00:53:22,560 --> 00:53:24,160
 they're like, it just came out of nowhere.

1248
00:53:24,160 --> 00:53:25,440
 They weren't even sick.

1249
00:53:25,440 --> 00:53:27,280
 But actually, they pretend to be healthy.

1250
00:53:27,280 --> 00:53:30,480
 They're like the opposite of possums, even if they're sick.

1251
00:53:30,480 --> 00:53:32,960
 And that's to just deflect attention from predators.

1252
00:53:32,960 --> 00:53:34,800
 Because if a predator sees a sick rabbit, it thinks,

1253
00:53:34,800 --> 00:53:36,000
 I'm going to catch that one.

1254
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:36,720
 Interesting.

1255
00:53:36,720 --> 00:53:39,360
 And so often they will just drop dead.

1256
00:53:39,360 --> 00:53:41,200
 But aren't they terrified of us?

1257
00:53:41,200 --> 00:53:42,720
 Aren't they terrified of human owners?

1258
00:53:42,720 --> 00:53:44,480
 I read a thing saying that when you pick a rabbit up

1259
00:53:44,480 --> 00:53:45,600
 and it's all still and quiet,

1260
00:53:45,600 --> 00:53:48,000
 it's just desperately hoping that you go away.

1261
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:49,360
 Yeah, they're rarely still and quiet.

1262
00:53:49,360 --> 00:53:50,480
 If you've ever had a pet rabbit,

1263
00:53:50,480 --> 00:53:52,880
 they will scratch your eyes out.

1264
00:53:52,880 --> 00:53:53,520
 Right.

1265
00:53:53,520 --> 00:53:54,160
 Oh.

1266
00:53:54,160 --> 00:53:54,880
 They're bad pets.

1267
00:53:54,880 --> 00:53:57,200
 They've got a pet docile and sort of calm.

1268
00:53:57,200 --> 00:54:00,560
 No, but I think maybe your parents got a dead rabbit

1269
00:54:00,560 --> 00:54:02,720
 from a local butcher and said it was a pet.

1270
00:54:02,720 --> 00:54:05,040
 A bloody butcher.

1271
00:54:05,040 --> 00:54:11,920
 You know the rabbits that were used in the Teletubbies show?

1272
00:54:11,920 --> 00:54:16,320
 They had to be so enormous because they were,

1273
00:54:16,320 --> 00:54:17,840
 because the Teletubbies were huge.

1274
00:54:17,840 --> 00:54:18,320
 Right.

1275
00:54:18,320 --> 00:54:21,040
 And it was like in a, they lived in a big field

1276
00:54:21,040 --> 00:54:23,040
 and there was lots of rabbits jumping around all the time.

1277
00:54:23,040 --> 00:54:23,680
 Was that so?

1278
00:54:23,680 --> 00:54:24,160
 Exactly.

1279
00:54:24,160 --> 00:54:24,480
 Yeah.

1280
00:54:24,480 --> 00:54:26,160
 And they were, they were Flemish giants,

1281
00:54:26,160 --> 00:54:28,080
 which I think are the largest rabbits on the planet.

1282
00:54:28,080 --> 00:54:30,160
 Or they're almost the largest breed that you can get

1283
00:54:30,160 --> 00:54:32,080
 because the Teletubbies costumes, which are so massive.

1284
00:54:32,080 --> 00:54:34,160
 Anyway, this, I got,

1285
00:54:34,160 --> 00:54:37,360
 I fell into a bit of a rabbit hole reading about these guys.

1286
00:54:37,360 --> 00:54:39,920
 And the problem was, firstly,

1287
00:54:39,920 --> 00:54:42,320
 the rabbits were always doing what rabbits do

1288
00:54:42,320 --> 00:54:43,520
 and trying to breed with each other.

1289
00:54:43,520 --> 00:54:44,800
 So they had to keep doing retakes

1290
00:54:44,800 --> 00:54:46,240
 because there would be a pair of rabbits

1291
00:54:46,240 --> 00:54:47,600
 in the background mating.

1292
00:54:48,240 --> 00:54:50,560
 And that, anyway, that's not really relevant

1293
00:54:50,560 --> 00:54:52,080
 because the main fact I wanted to say,

1294
00:54:52,080 --> 00:54:53,120
 I didn't know this.

1295
00:54:53,120 --> 00:54:56,560
 The Teletubby costumes were so enormous and ungainly

1296
00:54:56,560 --> 00:54:58,640
 and difficult to move around in

1297
00:54:58,640 --> 00:55:01,040
 that they had to have seats inside them

1298
00:55:01,040 --> 00:55:03,280
 so the actors could sit down between takes.

1299
00:55:03,280 --> 00:55:03,840
 No way.

1300
00:55:03,840 --> 00:55:05,200
 Oh my God.

1301
00:55:05,200 --> 00:55:06,880
 So if you see a Teletubby standing up,

1302
00:55:06,880 --> 00:55:08,320
 you don't know whether the person inside

1303
00:55:08,320 --> 00:55:09,520
 is sitting down or not.

1304
00:55:09,520 --> 00:55:11,280
 Do you think the reason the baby was laughing

1305
00:55:11,280 --> 00:55:13,440
 was because of all the rabbits mating though?

1306
00:55:13,440 --> 00:55:16,000
 I could see his tinky winky.

1307
00:55:16,480 --> 00:55:17,360
 Yeah.

1308
00:55:17,360 --> 00:55:21,200
 Okay, that's it.

1309
00:55:21,200 --> 00:55:22,240
