00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:18.400
 Hello and welcome to another episode of No Such Thing as a Fish,

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:23.280
 a weekly podcast coming to you from four undisclosed locations in the UK.

00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:24.560
 My name is Dan Schreiber.

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:29.280
 I'm sitting here with Anna Tyshinski, Andrew Hunter Murray, and James Harkin.

00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:33.200
 And once again, we have gathered round the microphones with our four favorite facts

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:38.000
 from the last seven days, and in no particular order, here we go.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:39.760
 Starting with you, Andy.

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:45.440
 My fact is that the doctor who invented the first decent thermometer suitable for rectal use

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:47.120
 was named Thomas Orbutt.

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:51.680
 It's the ultimate in nominative determinism, isn't it?

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:52.160
 It is.

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:58.320
 Yeah, it's just a cheap joke at the expense of a brilliant doctor who has done a lot more

00:00:58.320 --> 00:00:59.440
 for the world than I ever will.

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:04.640
 Do you think I was trying to look into whether or not he got any sort of

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:05.760
 shtick for it at the time?

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:08.000
 If anyone made any jokes about it, couldn't see anything.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:09.760
 It was just pure respect for the man.

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:11.920
 Wow, missing a trick in those days, weren't they?

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:12.400
 Idiots.

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:13.680
 When was this?

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:15.040
 It was like ten of the...

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:16.800
 It was the 1860s.

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:18.960
 He invented it in 1866, I think.

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:20.960
 He worked with the manufacturers on the design,

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:25.600
 and then he wrote an essay about it in 1868 in which he sort of described his making a bit.

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:29.040
 It's important to say he himself was an armpit man.

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:31.440
 What?

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:33.920
 Why do we need to know about his kinks?

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:37.760
 He said it's better to put...

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:40.800
 Because basically it was the first decent thermometer for use on patients.

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:43.920
 All the ones before that took about 20 minutes to get a good reading,

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:47.440
 and some of them were a foot long, and some of them were even longer than that.

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:49.760
 I mean, it was the Wild West out there.

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:55.360
 He created a much more reliable one, which was shorter and took very few minutes to get a reading,

00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:57.840
 but he himself said, look, the armpit is better.

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:02.160
 And he wrote this essay saying that if patients allow single rectal examinations,

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:06.000
 which is doubtful, they will certainly rebel against their frequent repetition.

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.440
 And this is as true of the coarser as the more sensitive natures.

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:12.800
 For in the former class of patients, the coarser variety,

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:15.600
 my assistants and myself have by such examinations,

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:18.160
 rectal examinations, excited comments,

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:21.040
 the narration of which would not tend to edification.

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:22.240
 Wow.

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:25.200
 What does he mean by coarser?

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:28.160
 Does he mean people who seem like they're really hard?

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:29.120
 Socially, Rafa.

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:32.480
 Yeah, I mean, he was a doctor in Leeds, wasn't he?

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:34.320
 So you can imagine his Yorkshire.

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:37.120
 Yeah, put in that thermometer anywhere near my ass.

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:44.880
 But he was a proper, good, famous doctor, wasn't he, in Leeds?

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:48.080
 His mother was a friend of the Brontes.

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:51.520
 He himself was a friend of George Elliott.

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:54.720
 And apparently, a character, I haven't read Middlemarch,

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:57.280
 but I know Anna and Andy at least haven't done my half as well.

00:02:57.280 --> 00:03:02.320
 But a character called Lidgate in Middlemarch, supposedly based on him, supposedly.

00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:04.320
 That makes sense. He is the doctor character.

00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:08.160
 I wouldn't surprise if it was Dorothea.

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:12.080
 His father was a rector.

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:16.480
 Father was a rector and he was a rectal prober.

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:20.640
 Well, his father was the rector of a place in Suffolk called

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:22.160
 the back cum bulge.

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:25.200
 No, what?

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:29.440
 That's a great link.

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:30.880
 Really? It's so good.

00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:34.320
 Well, I love the literary links, as you were saying, James, with George Elliott.

00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:38.240
 They were really good friends and she wrote about him a lot.

00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:41.440
 And that we have one quote particular, which she says,

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:44.800
 "A good, clever, graceful man enough to enable one to be cheerful

00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:47.200
 under the horrible smoke of ugly Leeds."

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:50.560
 I think they went then.

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:53.840
 Yeah, in fairness, that was a trip that George Elliott

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:56.720
 and her friend were making from Leeds to Bolton.

00:03:56.720 --> 00:03:58.320
 And if you're going to go to Bolton,

00:03:58.320 --> 00:03:59.920
 anywhere is going to look ugly, isn't it?

00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:02.880
 Was it actually?

00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:03.680
 Yeah.

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:06.240
 You must have been so excited by that.

00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:08.800
 Did she give then a bucolic description of Bolton?

00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:10.720
 I couldn't. I looked.

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:12.240
 I must admit, I looked.

00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:15.520
 And I was more excited of finding out that she went to Bolton

00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:18.960
 than I was about finding out his dad was from the back cum bulge.

00:04:19.360 --> 00:04:20.720
 That's how excited I was.

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:24.800
 Wow, when something excites you more than a rude name,

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:25.840
 you know you're a business.

00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:31.280
 Yeah, he was kind of had an unrivaled reputation

00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:32.480
 in that area, I think.

00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:35.440
 And then he quit doctoring in the late '80s

00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:38.160
 and became commissioner for lunacy

00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:40.480
 and kind of looked at mental health problems.

00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:42.960
 And the reason that he left, no one was quite sure why he left,

00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:46.560
 but they think it might be because his uncle was very badly treated.

00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:48.800
 His uncle was called Henry All Butt.

00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:53.440
 And he had written a book called The Wife's Handbook in 1885,

00:04:53.440 --> 00:04:56.080
 which described contraceptive methods for women.

00:04:56.080 --> 00:05:00.640
 And the people at the time thought that this should not be allowed,

00:05:00.640 --> 00:05:02.400
 especially for working-class women.

00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:05.280
 And he was struck off from the medical register in 1887

00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:07.280
 because he'd written this book about contraception.

00:05:07.280 --> 00:05:11.440
 He said, "Knowledge may be all right for the rich lady

00:05:11.440 --> 00:05:13.520
 who can afford to buy a guinea medical book

00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:15.280
 and pay a big fee to a doctor,

00:05:15.280 --> 00:05:17.520
 but it is an offence of an infamous character

00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:20.160
 for a physician to write and sell a book at sixpence,

00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:22.400
 showing the poor how to better their hard lot."

00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:24.240
 That is really interesting.

00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:25.280
 God, what a family.

00:05:25.280 --> 00:05:26.720
 I know, amazing, eh?

00:05:26.720 --> 00:05:27.680
 Yeah.

00:05:27.680 --> 00:05:29.440
 Apparently, not a good sense of humour, though.

00:05:29.440 --> 00:05:31.680
 On the downside,

00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:33.600
 Paul calling to one biography friends called him

00:05:33.600 --> 00:05:36.000
 "caughtly and aristocratic in demeanour,

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:38.160
 gracious of mind and bearing,

00:05:38.160 --> 00:05:40.400
 but serious and somewhat humorless."

00:05:40.400 --> 00:05:43.840
 So he couldn't have seen the comedy in his own name.

00:05:43.840 --> 00:05:44.400
 So sad.

00:05:44.400 --> 00:05:46.240
 Oh, that is tragic, yeah.

00:05:46.240 --> 00:05:49.680
 The first person to decide that temperature

00:05:49.680 --> 00:05:52.720
 in a healthy person is always going to be about the same,

00:05:52.720 --> 00:05:55.520
 and that if you have a high or low temperature,

00:05:55.520 --> 00:05:57.280
 it could be due to your disease,

00:05:57.280 --> 00:05:59.200
 was a guy called Carl Wunderlich.

00:05:59.200 --> 00:06:02.240
 Wow.

00:06:02.240 --> 00:06:04.640
 And he came up with that in 1868.

00:06:04.640 --> 00:06:07.040
 And what excited me about that at first

00:06:07.040 --> 00:06:09.040
 is because I did know of another Wunderlich

00:06:09.040 --> 00:06:11.120
 that I'd read about recently.

00:06:11.120 --> 00:06:12.800
 That's JÃ¶rg Wunderlich.

00:06:12.800 --> 00:06:16.640
 And he found very recently the world's oldest known erection.

00:06:16.640 --> 00:06:19.360
 This was in a spider.

00:06:19.360 --> 00:06:21.520
 Spiders don't always have erections,

00:06:21.520 --> 00:06:22.960
 but some of the old ones did.

00:06:22.960 --> 00:06:24.400
 And it was a harvestman.

00:06:24.400 --> 00:06:28.720
 And 99 million years ago, it had a erection

00:06:28.720 --> 00:06:32.320
 and then was killed by some flowing sap from a tree

00:06:32.320 --> 00:06:34.000
 which froze it in place.

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:37.680
 And this knocked back the earliest erection

00:06:37.680 --> 00:06:40.320
 by something like 30 or 40 million years.

00:06:40.320 --> 00:06:41.760
 Wow.

00:06:41.760 --> 00:06:45.520
 Did that previous oldest erection just immediately go flaccid?

00:06:45.520 --> 00:06:50.320
 Anyway, that's your Wunderlich.

00:06:50.320 --> 00:06:53.200
 That's so perfect, because obviously erections

00:06:53.200 --> 00:06:55.440
 are often caused by a Wunderlich, aren't they?

00:06:55.440 --> 00:06:58.560
 So it's extreme, just explaining the normative determinism

00:06:58.560 --> 00:07:00.560
 for anyone who didn't make the link.

00:07:00.560 --> 00:07:01.680
 Thanks, Hannah.

00:07:01.680 --> 00:07:03.120
 James, are they related to these Wunderlichs?

00:07:03.120 --> 00:07:04.480
 Or are you just using it as an excuse

00:07:04.480 --> 00:07:05.840
 to talk about spider penises?

00:07:05.840 --> 00:07:08.560
 Andy, I spent so much time going through

00:07:09.680 --> 00:07:12.640
 if the Wunderlich family ever needs any genealogy,

00:07:12.640 --> 00:07:14.080
 I could help them so much,

00:07:14.080 --> 00:07:16.480
 because I looked through their entire family tree.

00:07:16.480 --> 00:07:18.480
 Let's see through some really old records

00:07:18.480 --> 00:07:21.040
 to try and find evidence of these two Wunderlichs were related.

00:07:21.040 --> 00:07:23.760
 I was just picturing you in the British library

00:07:23.760 --> 00:07:27.280
 surrounded by dusty tomes all open to the Wunderlich page.

00:07:27.280 --> 00:07:33.840
 I was thinking about the modern-day thermometers.

00:07:33.840 --> 00:07:36.560
 We've all used a lot recently over the last year.

00:07:36.560 --> 00:07:39.600
 And we've all thought, "Is this really working?"

00:07:39.600 --> 00:07:42.080
 When you go into a public building or a place of work

00:07:42.080 --> 00:07:44.400
 or a pub when we were allowed to go into pubs

00:07:44.400 --> 00:07:46.320
 and you're standing in front of those thermometers

00:07:46.320 --> 00:07:48.080
 and they tell you what your temperature is.

00:07:48.080 --> 00:07:48.960
 The forehead gun.

00:07:48.960 --> 00:07:51.440
 Or also just a screen sometimes, isn't it?

00:07:51.440 --> 00:07:55.520
 Yeah, a screen, a forehead gun, the non-touch thermometers.

00:07:55.520 --> 00:07:56.560
 And I don't know about you guys,

00:07:56.560 --> 00:07:59.200
 but often you get a reading that is ridiculous,

00:07:59.200 --> 00:08:01.040
 like 33.5 or something.

00:08:01.040 --> 00:08:04.000
 But then I always take the screen off and put it up my rectum.

00:08:04.400 --> 00:08:09.840
 They've had to replace those on the BBC so many times.

00:08:09.840 --> 00:08:12.000
 But they are very unreliable.

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:14.000
 So the FDA, the Food and Drug Administration,

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:17.200
 found, first of all, that the seven widely used ones,

00:08:17.200 --> 00:08:19.840
 seven of the most widely used ones, what they do is,

00:08:19.840 --> 00:08:22.480
 they compensate for imprecision and unpredictability,

00:08:22.480 --> 00:08:24.640
 which can be caused by, like, if it's a very hot day

00:08:24.640 --> 00:08:27.680
 or if you've just cycled to the work or something.

00:08:27.680 --> 00:08:30.960
 They compensate for that by normalizing the readings,

00:08:30.960 --> 00:08:33.040
 which essentially means that if they find a reading

00:08:33.040 --> 00:08:35.600
 that they think is too extreme, they bring it down again.

00:08:35.600 --> 00:08:36.960
 Really? Oh, my God.

00:08:36.960 --> 00:08:38.240
 I find that really interesting,

00:08:38.240 --> 00:08:39.920
 because I am quite a sweaty man,

00:08:39.920 --> 00:08:41.360
 especially when I've been cycling.

00:08:41.360 --> 00:08:44.480
 And I always cycle to the studios when we made QI.

00:08:44.480 --> 00:08:48.240
 And I always think I must be in the high 50s, my temperature.

00:08:48.240 --> 00:08:50.560
 But it always comes up as 30, whatever.

00:08:50.560 --> 00:08:51.120
 I don't know what it is.

00:08:51.120 --> 00:08:53.120
 I'm totally with you. I'm so with you.

00:08:53.120 --> 00:08:55.440
 There must be a way for people to fail the readings.

00:08:55.440 --> 00:08:57.280
 Otherwise, what is the point?

00:08:57.280 --> 00:08:58.080
 There is.

00:08:58.080 --> 00:08:59.680
 So that's quite a broad overview of what they do.

00:08:59.680 --> 00:09:01.200
 So basically, the study found that you could have

00:09:01.200 --> 00:09:02.800
 a core temperature of about 38.5,

00:09:02.800 --> 00:09:04.880
 and it would readjust to 36.6.

00:09:04.880 --> 00:09:06.480
 And its algorithms are trying to compensate

00:09:06.480 --> 00:09:08.080
 for various other environmental factors

00:09:08.080 --> 00:09:09.920
 that they think might be happening.

00:09:09.920 --> 00:09:11.600
 But it's unreliable enough

00:09:11.600 --> 00:09:14.400
 that you could also just have a temperature of 38.5

00:09:14.400 --> 00:09:15.840
 and register as 36.

00:09:15.840 --> 00:09:17.760
 And they did another study in Australia, I think,

00:09:17.760 --> 00:09:20.240
 where they found that in five out of six cases,

00:09:20.240 --> 00:09:21.520
 they missed a fever.

00:09:21.520 --> 00:09:23.920
 It's really interesting in terms of coronavirus.

00:09:23.920 --> 00:09:26.480
 There was one company called Kinsey Health

00:09:26.480 --> 00:09:29.680
 who have smartphone connected thermometers.

00:09:29.680 --> 00:09:32.240
 And so basically, they've been gathering data

00:09:32.240 --> 00:09:34.080
 for the last nine years.

00:09:34.080 --> 00:09:36.640
 And in the lead-up to coronavirus,

00:09:36.640 --> 00:09:38.400
 they basically spotted it

00:09:38.400 --> 00:09:41.600
 because suddenly, there was this patch of high fevers

00:09:41.600 --> 00:09:42.480
 around the whole country.

00:09:42.480 --> 00:09:45.680
 They said it was like this big swarm of just high fevers.

00:09:45.680 --> 00:09:47.280
 And they were going, "What the hell is this?"

00:09:47.280 --> 00:09:50.080
 And they tried to report it to various different people,

00:09:50.080 --> 00:09:52.800
 but no one was taking the results as credible.

00:09:52.800 --> 00:09:54.080
 And so they think for the future,

00:09:54.080 --> 00:09:58.800
 these kind of smartphone-operated data-gathering thermometers

00:09:58.800 --> 00:10:01.840
 might prevent us from ever really going too far

00:10:01.840 --> 00:10:04.320
 down the line of an unrecognized pandemic.

00:10:04.320 --> 00:10:05.280
 I just want to stick up

00:10:05.280 --> 00:10:07.920
 for the good old-fashioned mercury thermometers here,

00:10:07.920 --> 00:10:09.280
 which is out of fashion

00:10:09.280 --> 00:10:11.840
 because apparently mercury is very dangerous.

00:10:11.840 --> 00:10:14.000
 And it turns out you can't buy mercury thermometers

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:14.880
 any more in the UK.

00:10:14.880 --> 00:10:18.480
 I can't believe you don't know that.

00:10:18.480 --> 00:10:20.240
 I feel like they were bound in my childhood.

00:10:20.240 --> 00:10:22.480
 They were bound in 2009.

00:10:22.480 --> 00:10:24.480
 I think we had them at my school.

00:10:24.480 --> 00:10:25.520
 I think we had...

00:10:25.520 --> 00:10:29.440
 I remember some mercury smashing on the floor in my school

00:10:29.440 --> 00:10:33.040
 and everyone panicking and throwing sand on it and stuff.

00:10:33.040 --> 00:10:35.600
 I think it's perfectly safe to...

00:10:35.600 --> 00:10:37.120
 Is that mercury?

00:10:37.120 --> 00:10:38.560
 As long as you don't inhale the fumes,

00:10:38.560 --> 00:10:40.480
 I think it's fine to swallow it, for example.

00:10:40.480 --> 00:10:42.240
 Are we saying that really?

00:10:42.240 --> 00:10:43.520
 Well, it doesn't matter.

00:10:43.520 --> 00:10:44.880
 No one's got one anymore, apparently,

00:10:44.880 --> 00:10:46.240
 apart from me and my parents,

00:10:46.240 --> 00:10:48.160
 who both work in the hat trade, and they're absolutely fine.

00:10:48.160 --> 00:10:52.080
 It's insane.

00:10:52.080 --> 00:10:55.040
 The EU, the EU, I have to say,

00:10:55.040 --> 00:10:57.120
 the EU tried to ban barometers,

00:10:57.120 --> 00:10:58.480
 which also contain mercury,

00:10:58.480 --> 00:10:59.840
 because they contain mercury.

00:10:59.840 --> 00:11:00.880
 Antique barometers.

00:11:00.880 --> 00:11:03.120
 This was a tiny amount of mercury.

00:11:03.120 --> 00:11:03.520
 Oh, my God.

00:11:03.520 --> 00:11:06.480
 Right, Nigel, you have lost a plot a bit here,

00:11:06.480 --> 00:11:08.240
 and I think we should emphasize that mercury

00:11:08.240 --> 00:11:10.080
 can be very dangerous

00:11:10.080 --> 00:11:13.280
 if you smash one of those flimsy barometers.

00:11:13.280 --> 00:11:15.200
 If anyone agrees with Andy,

00:11:15.200 --> 00:11:18.240
 then there will be a rally at the White Cliffs of Dover.

00:11:18.240 --> 00:11:19.440
 Bring your own barometer.

00:11:19.440 --> 00:11:24.800
 We'll all, together, smash the barometers

00:11:24.800 --> 00:11:27.360
 and drink the mercury and prove.

00:11:27.600 --> 00:11:31.200
 And that is how survival of the fittest works.

00:11:31.200 --> 00:11:32.320
 Well, you're like this, Andy.

00:11:32.320 --> 00:11:35.760
 You know who had mercury in them when they went to space?

00:11:35.760 --> 00:11:38.240
 Oh, that does narrow it down.

00:11:38.240 --> 00:11:39.440
 It does, doesn't it?

00:11:39.440 --> 00:11:40.000
 Yeah.

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:40.960
 Chong Glenn.

00:11:40.960 --> 00:11:42.080
 Chong Glenn would have.

00:11:42.080 --> 00:11:43.920
 The mercury astronauts.

00:11:43.920 --> 00:11:45.520
 Oh, you're kidding.

00:11:45.520 --> 00:11:46.480
 So they had mercury.

00:11:46.480 --> 00:11:48.880
 Well, to an extent,

00:11:48.880 --> 00:11:51.200
 all the mercury astronauts that went into space,

00:11:51.200 --> 00:11:52.800
 they had all their vital signs

00:11:52.800 --> 00:11:54.640
 being sussed out the whole way through.

00:11:54.640 --> 00:11:56.720
 They sort of had all these pads

00:11:56.720 --> 00:11:58.560
 on them monitoring their heart rates and stuff.

00:11:58.560 --> 00:11:59.920
 But what I hadn't read before

00:11:59.920 --> 00:12:03.680
 is they also had a thermometer up the bum for their trips.

00:12:03.680 --> 00:12:06.960
 All the mercury astronauts, except for the final one,

00:12:06.960 --> 00:12:08.720
 had a thermometer in their bum.

00:12:08.720 --> 00:12:11.600
 It must have been strange when the aliens got them

00:12:11.600 --> 00:12:13.280
 and they started adally probing them.

00:12:13.280 --> 00:12:14.160
 And they're like, what?

00:12:14.160 --> 00:12:15.440
 Someone's been here already.

00:12:15.440 --> 00:12:20.720
 Yeah, so that was a thing.

00:12:20.720 --> 00:12:23.440
 And was it up there the whole time?

00:12:23.440 --> 00:12:25.360
 Yeah, because how long were the missions?

00:12:25.360 --> 00:12:26.400
 These weren't long missions, right?

00:12:26.400 --> 00:12:28.400
 They would go up, they would orbit the planets.

00:12:28.400 --> 00:12:30.080
 I imagine they felt longer, didn't they?

00:12:30.080 --> 00:12:32.640
 How do you know the difference

00:12:32.640 --> 00:12:35.280
 between a rectal thermometer and an oral thermometer?

00:12:35.280 --> 00:12:36.720
 This is very important, I reckon.

00:12:36.720 --> 00:12:38.400
 This feels like a joke.

00:12:38.400 --> 00:12:39.280
 It's not a joke.

00:12:39.280 --> 00:12:42.800
 Feels like it's going to be the smell.

00:12:42.800 --> 00:12:46.480
 Before it's been used.

00:12:46.480 --> 00:12:48.800
 How do you work it out before it's been used?

00:12:48.800 --> 00:12:51.680
 Is it the size of the bulb or something?

00:12:51.680 --> 00:12:52.800
 Pretty much right, yeah.

00:12:52.800 --> 00:12:55.920
 So a rectal thermometer will always have a round bulbous tip.

00:12:55.920 --> 00:12:58.480
 And an oral thermometer will have a longer, thin tip.

00:12:58.480 --> 00:13:01.360
 And according to the website, I read it said,

00:13:01.360 --> 00:13:03.120
 a rectal thermometer should never be used

00:13:03.120 --> 00:13:04.320
 to take an oral temperature.

00:13:04.320 --> 00:13:06.240
 And an oral thermometer should never be used

00:13:06.240 --> 00:13:07.760
 to take a rectal temperature.

00:13:07.760 --> 00:13:11.360
 But either one can be used to take an armpit temperature.

00:13:11.360 --> 00:13:13.440
 So it's just a little tip.

00:13:13.440 --> 00:13:14.720
 The Switzerland temperature.

00:13:14.720 --> 00:13:18.160
 Is that not because of the danger of contamination?

00:13:18.160 --> 00:13:19.440
 It does feel like just to be safe.

00:13:19.440 --> 00:13:21.680
 They're saying, obviously, don't put something

00:13:21.680 --> 00:13:23.680
 that might have been in someone's bum in your mouth.

00:13:23.680 --> 00:13:27.040
 I think that's quite sensible in that direction.

00:13:27.040 --> 00:13:28.320
 And then in the other direction,

00:13:28.320 --> 00:13:31.200
 you don't want something spiky going up your bum.

00:13:31.200 --> 00:13:32.720
 Yeah, that's true as well.

00:13:32.720 --> 00:13:34.880
 And the other thing is, and the very important

00:13:34.880 --> 00:13:36.480
 to get the difference between the thermometer

00:13:36.480 --> 00:13:38.080
 and the barometer when you're putting it up.

00:13:38.080 --> 00:13:42.080
 A rectal barometer.

00:13:42.080 --> 00:13:44.800
 Just get the pressure up there.

00:13:44.800 --> 00:13:49.200
 Your mind is taken completely off

00:13:49.200 --> 00:13:50.800
 what the weather is going to be doing tomorrow.

00:13:53.200 --> 00:13:56.720
 I was reading about nature's thermometer.

00:13:56.720 --> 00:14:01.200
 And there was a scientist called Amos Dolbert

00:14:01.200 --> 00:14:06.160
 who noticed that crickets would chirp at a certain rate.

00:14:06.160 --> 00:14:09.920
 And if you counted the number of clicks that they were doing,

00:14:09.920 --> 00:14:13.280
 you could tell what the temperature was.

00:14:13.280 --> 00:14:16.560
 And it was useful and unuseful because, A,

00:14:16.560 --> 00:14:19.360
 he didn't specify what species of cricket it was.

00:14:19.360 --> 00:14:21.680
 So everyone was just like, we've got the readings,

00:14:21.680 --> 00:14:23.840
 but we can't find what the hell you're talking about.

00:14:23.840 --> 00:14:26.560
 They think that it was a snowy tree cricket.

00:14:26.560 --> 00:14:29.120
 But then they also have noticed

00:14:29.120 --> 00:14:30.960
 that there are other field crickets that do it,

00:14:30.960 --> 00:14:32.160
 but not all field crickets.

00:14:32.160 --> 00:14:33.920
 So it's the weirdest thermometer.

00:14:33.920 --> 00:14:36.960
 You need this one specific cricket in order to tell it.

00:14:36.960 --> 00:14:38.560
 And then there's others that might tell you,

00:14:38.560 --> 00:14:40.160
 and others that will get it wrong

00:14:40.160 --> 00:14:41.920
 if they're a different part of the same species.

00:14:41.920 --> 00:14:42.800
 It's really bizarre.

00:14:42.800 --> 00:14:45.520
 I think also, if it goes below a certain temperature,

00:14:45.520 --> 00:14:47.840
 they all go to sleep and stop doing anything at all.

00:14:50.320 --> 00:14:52.320
 But if you find that one species

00:14:52.320 --> 00:14:54.080
 that we're not even sure is the right species,

00:14:54.080 --> 00:14:56.480
 then you can tell the temperature.

00:14:56.480 --> 00:14:58.000
 The advantage of the cricket thermometer

00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:00.560
 is that crickets are not toxic, unlike mercury.

00:15:00.560 --> 00:15:04.800
 So you can eat them without any serious harm.

00:15:04.800 --> 00:15:06.240
 But don't stick them up your bum.

00:15:06.240 --> 00:15:08.080
 That will not work.

00:15:08.080 --> 00:15:09.120
 It's hard to hear them chirp.

00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:22.240
 OK, it is time for fact number two.

00:15:22.240 --> 00:15:23.520
 And that is Anna.

00:15:23.520 --> 00:15:26.560
 My fact this week is that Cold War spy planes

00:15:26.560 --> 00:15:28.400
 were equipped with rear view mirrors

00:15:28.400 --> 00:15:29.760
 so that pilots could check

00:15:29.760 --> 00:15:31.440
 they weren't leaving a trail behind them.

00:15:31.440 --> 00:15:33.200
 Like a paper trail?

00:15:33.200 --> 00:15:34.320
 What kind of trail we're talking?

00:15:34.320 --> 00:15:37.600
 Just dropping clues out the window.

00:15:37.600 --> 00:15:39.200
 Then I shouldn't have done that.

00:15:39.200 --> 00:15:41.520
 A con trail.

00:15:41.520 --> 00:15:43.840
 Or, as some of you might know them, a chem trail.

00:15:43.840 --> 00:15:44.800
 Oh my God.

00:15:44.800 --> 00:15:46.640
 Wow, straight into the test tube.

00:15:49.280 --> 00:15:50.480
 I'm going to reverse out of that.

00:15:50.480 --> 00:15:51.360
 They're just con trails.

00:15:51.360 --> 00:15:52.080
 They're not chem trails.

00:15:52.080 --> 00:15:53.040
 What does the con mean, is it?

00:15:53.040 --> 00:15:56.960
 It's a big old con, spawned by the government.

00:15:56.960 --> 00:16:01.200
 So con trails are basically that kind of string of white

00:16:01.200 --> 00:16:03.680
 that comes out of the bottom of a plane

00:16:03.680 --> 00:16:04.480
 when it's flying.

00:16:04.480 --> 00:16:07.840
 And it's created when water condenses to form ice crystals

00:16:07.840 --> 00:16:10.800
 around the tiny particles of kind of soot and dirt and dust

00:16:10.800 --> 00:16:13.360
 that are being emitted from the aircraft exhausts.

00:16:13.360 --> 00:16:15.760
 And major problem for spy planes,

00:16:15.760 --> 00:16:18.160
 because often a spy plane is so high up you can't see it.

00:16:18.160 --> 00:16:20.240
 But what you can see is this trail,

00:16:20.240 --> 00:16:21.680
 which, if you follow it to the front,

00:16:21.680 --> 00:16:23.840
 leads directly to the plane that you need to shoot down.

00:16:23.840 --> 00:16:28.320
 And it was known, but they sort of started spotting them

00:16:28.320 --> 00:16:29.920
 in the early Second World War.

00:16:29.920 --> 00:16:32.480
 And all planes had kind of rear view mirrors,

00:16:32.480 --> 00:16:33.360
 or war planes did,

00:16:33.360 --> 00:16:35.040
 because you needed to see if someone was chasing you,

00:16:35.040 --> 00:16:36.320
 or most war planes did.

00:16:36.320 --> 00:16:39.120
 And then after that, they didn't.

00:16:39.120 --> 00:16:41.840
 But it became apparent in the 1950s,

00:16:41.840 --> 00:16:45.680
 when the Lockheed U2 very famous spy planes were being made,

00:16:45.680 --> 00:16:47.520
 that however high up they were,

00:16:47.520 --> 00:16:50.160
 it wasn't going to work in evading detection

00:16:50.160 --> 00:16:51.760
 because they were leaving contrails,

00:16:51.760 --> 00:16:53.680
 unless they had a way of looking behind them

00:16:53.680 --> 00:16:55.440
 to see if they were and avoid it.

00:16:55.440 --> 00:16:57.040
 And so they just have these little mirrors.

00:16:57.040 --> 00:16:59.520
 So you've got the most high tech plane possibly ever.

00:16:59.520 --> 00:17:01.680
 And then on a little pole on its nose,

00:17:01.680 --> 00:17:03.040
 you've got a rear view mirror.

00:17:03.040 --> 00:17:04.960
 And if you check behind you and you see the trail,

00:17:04.960 --> 00:17:06.400
 you can kind of change your altitude,

00:17:06.400 --> 00:17:08.800
 or change your speed, or reduce the throttle.

00:17:08.800 --> 00:17:10.400
 And that can reduce the trail.

00:17:10.400 --> 00:17:13.920
 Yeah, I think like certain areas of the sky

00:17:13.920 --> 00:17:16.960
 are more susceptible to contrails, aren't they?

00:17:16.960 --> 00:17:17.840
 I think because they have a bit more water.

00:17:17.840 --> 00:17:19.120
 The moisty bits, isn't it?

00:17:19.120 --> 00:17:19.760
 The moisty bits.

00:17:19.760 --> 00:17:20.480
 The moisty bits.

00:17:20.480 --> 00:17:22.480
 Yeah, I didn't want to get too technical, but yes.

00:17:22.480 --> 00:17:26.320
 But it changes, it changes a lot, doesn't it?

00:17:26.320 --> 00:17:29.040
 It's not like you can't fly between these altitudes.

00:17:29.040 --> 00:17:30.640
 It's sometimes, you know,

00:17:30.640 --> 00:17:32.960
 it's only a few hundred meters of altitude that changes it.

00:17:32.960 --> 00:17:35.920
 So it does feel very finessed what they're doing.

00:17:35.920 --> 00:17:39.120
 Yeah, those spy planes are, they are incredible.

00:17:39.120 --> 00:17:40.480
 Yeah, the U2.

00:17:40.480 --> 00:17:43.600
 The mirror is literally the least interesting thing about it

00:17:43.600 --> 00:17:45.280
 when you start looking to it.

00:17:45.280 --> 00:17:46.160
 Just one minute.

00:17:46.160 --> 00:17:47.440
 I mean, your fact is great,

00:17:47.440 --> 00:17:51.040
 but what I mean is these planes were astonishing.

00:17:51.040 --> 00:17:54.800
 So can I give my quick favorite fact about the U2 spy planes?

00:17:54.800 --> 00:17:58.080
 It takes two pilots to land a U2 spy plane,

00:17:58.080 --> 00:17:59.760
 one inside the plane,

00:17:59.760 --> 00:18:03.440
 and one on the ground in a car chasing the plane.

00:18:03.440 --> 00:18:06.720
 Because the outfit that you need to wear

00:18:06.720 --> 00:18:09.760
 in order to go 70,000 feet into the air,

00:18:09.760 --> 00:18:11.280
 which is how high these planes go,

00:18:11.280 --> 00:18:13.600
 it's basically you need to wear astronaut gear.

00:18:13.600 --> 00:18:15.760
 And it's really hard to turn yourself

00:18:15.760 --> 00:18:18.880
 and see where you're landing in these planes.

00:18:18.880 --> 00:18:21.280
 So as you're coming in to land,

00:18:21.280 --> 00:18:23.760
 the other pilot in the car is driving behind you

00:18:23.760 --> 00:18:25.840
 and radioing in your position,

00:18:25.840 --> 00:18:27.680
 going, "You're nearly there, just a bit more, mate.

00:18:27.680 --> 00:18:29.600
 Come on, you got better codes than that."

00:18:29.600 --> 00:18:32.800
 But literally speaks you into a landing

00:18:32.800 --> 00:18:35.600
 in a car going 140 miles an hour behind you.

00:18:35.600 --> 00:18:36.720
 It's unbelievable.

00:18:36.720 --> 00:18:38.000
 It's extraordinary.

00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:40.560
 Basically, it's a plane that's designed to be 70,000 feet up.

00:18:40.560 --> 00:18:42.640
 It doesn't really like being at ground level.

00:18:42.640 --> 00:18:44.880
 So it's got two...

00:18:44.880 --> 00:18:47.360
 You know, the normal set of plane wheels are in a triangle.

00:18:47.360 --> 00:18:49.520
 So you've got the two sets at the back and one at the front,

00:18:49.520 --> 00:18:50.400
 and you come down on the back one,

00:18:50.400 --> 00:18:52.640
 set the front one, it's lovely, jubbly, you're on the ground.

00:18:52.640 --> 00:18:55.440
 The U2 plane has got two sets of wheels,

00:18:55.440 --> 00:18:58.000
 which are lined up front to back like a bicycle.

00:18:58.000 --> 00:19:01.680
 And I mean, it's just a nightmare to land.

00:19:01.680 --> 00:19:03.360
 You basically have to slow down so much

00:19:03.360 --> 00:19:04.480
 that it can't fly anymore.

00:19:04.480 --> 00:19:05.680
 That's how you land it.

00:19:05.680 --> 00:19:07.920
 You get to about two feet above the ground,

00:19:07.920 --> 00:19:09.840
 and then you just slow down and slow down and slow down,

00:19:09.840 --> 00:19:12.480
 and it will just drop out of the sky onto these double wheels.

00:19:12.960 --> 00:19:14.240
 Now, you stall it, don't you?

00:19:14.240 --> 00:19:16.000
 You have to stall before you touch the ground.

00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:16.720
 Every time.

00:19:16.720 --> 00:19:19.600
 But then you don't properly stop until the plane tips over,

00:19:19.600 --> 00:19:21.520
 effectively crashing.

00:19:21.520 --> 00:19:24.000
 Like, basically, you have to crash land

00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:24.960
 in order to stop the plane.

00:19:24.960 --> 00:19:27.280
 And what they have is these steel plates

00:19:27.280 --> 00:19:29.680
 underneath each of the wingtips.

00:19:29.680 --> 00:19:32.480
 So whichever side it keels over onto,

00:19:32.480 --> 00:19:35.840
 that's the bit that starts helping them come to a full stop.

00:19:35.840 --> 00:19:37.760
 It reminds me, if you know when you're a kid

00:19:37.760 --> 00:19:38.800
 and you're learning to ride a bike,

00:19:38.800 --> 00:19:40.960
 I think that tends to be how you stop at first,

00:19:40.960 --> 00:19:43.200
 is you just wait until you fall off one side.

00:19:43.200 --> 00:19:44.080
 It's like that.

00:19:44.080 --> 00:19:45.760
 Same with me when skiing.

00:19:45.760 --> 00:19:46.240
 There you go.

00:19:46.240 --> 00:19:50.080
 When you're flying them, you were saying about stalling.

00:19:50.080 --> 00:19:52.000
 If you go too slow, then you'll stall.

00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:54.640
 But if you go too fast, then the plane falls apart.

00:19:54.640 --> 00:19:57.680
 And so there's only a 12-miles-an-hour speed window

00:19:57.680 --> 00:19:58.960
 that you're allowed to fly in.

00:19:58.960 --> 00:20:00.960
 And if you go too slow, you crash.

00:20:00.960 --> 00:20:02.640
 And if you go too fast, you crash.

00:20:02.640 --> 00:20:04.160
 So you're basically the whole time

00:20:04.160 --> 00:20:05.360
 just looking at the speed up.

00:20:05.360 --> 00:20:08.320
 It's like, oh, oh, oh.

00:20:08.320 --> 00:20:09.520
 I think it sometimes--

00:20:09.520 --> 00:20:11.600
 I think it can be as low as seven sometimes.

00:20:11.600 --> 00:20:13.280
 It's called the coffin corner,

00:20:13.280 --> 00:20:15.920
 which they've got to start rebranding some of their names

00:20:15.920 --> 00:20:17.280
 as if you're not scared enough.

00:20:17.280 --> 00:20:18.880
 But yeah, it's amazing.

00:20:18.880 --> 00:20:22.320
 And it's because it flies so high is when you're flying high.

00:20:22.320 --> 00:20:25.120
 Your max speed is when you break the sound barrier.

00:20:25.120 --> 00:20:27.120
 And the sound barrier gets lower and lower,

00:20:27.120 --> 00:20:28.800
 the higher and higher you get, right?

00:20:28.800 --> 00:20:29.680
 So as soon as you get high,

00:20:29.680 --> 00:20:30.960
 you're going to break the sound barrier

00:20:30.960 --> 00:20:32.400
 if you go not that fast.

00:20:32.400 --> 00:20:34.640
 They're just such gorgeous machines.

00:20:34.640 --> 00:20:36.480
 And I didn't realize they're so old as well.

00:20:36.480 --> 00:20:38.880
 The model first flew in 1955.

00:20:38.880 --> 00:20:41.760
 And I don't think any of those actual planes themselves

00:20:41.760 --> 00:20:42.880
 are still in the air today.

00:20:42.880 --> 00:20:45.440
 But the model has been adjusted a bit since then.

00:20:45.440 --> 00:20:46.880
 But it's being updated now.

00:20:46.880 --> 00:20:48.800
 It's probably going to be flying for another 30 years.

00:20:48.800 --> 00:20:49.360
 It's probably going--

00:20:49.360 --> 00:20:52.800
 This one model of plane is probably going to do 100 years

00:20:52.800 --> 00:20:54.320
 in service, which is mad.

00:20:54.320 --> 00:20:56.480
 Do you know what potentially--

00:20:56.480 --> 00:20:59.600
 I think we can say the U2 spy plane

00:20:59.600 --> 00:21:02.720
 is responsible for a very exciting thing

00:21:02.720 --> 00:21:04.000
 in the world of conspiracy.

00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:06.560
 Is it the Joshua tree?

00:21:07.600 --> 00:21:08.400
 Off.

00:21:08.400 --> 00:21:10.320
 I was hoping we'd get onto the U2 puns.

00:21:10.320 --> 00:21:13.920
 It's sitting here saying, you know--

00:21:13.920 --> 00:21:15.840
 Who's going to crack first?

00:21:15.840 --> 00:21:16.320
 Yeah.

00:21:16.320 --> 00:21:16.560
 No.

00:21:16.560 --> 00:21:21.120
 Area 51 in the Nevada desert.

00:21:21.120 --> 00:21:24.640
 It was-- there were some declassified documents

00:21:24.640 --> 00:21:26.400
 that came out a number of years ago,

00:21:26.400 --> 00:21:28.800
 which showed that they needed a testing space

00:21:28.800 --> 00:21:31.120
 for the spy plane, for the U2 spy plane.

00:21:31.120 --> 00:21:33.680
 So they needed somewhere to officially do that.

00:21:33.680 --> 00:21:36.320
 And that is what Area 51 was set up for.

00:21:36.320 --> 00:21:36.960
 Wow.

00:21:36.960 --> 00:21:39.600
 Area 51 famously, where the streets have no name.

00:21:39.600 --> 00:21:41.040
 There you go.

00:21:41.040 --> 00:21:41.280
 Yeah.

00:21:41.280 --> 00:21:42.000
 There we go.

00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:43.120
 That's number two.

00:21:43.120 --> 00:21:43.840
 Absolutely.

00:21:43.840 --> 00:21:44.880
 Keep counting.

00:21:44.880 --> 00:21:47.920
 Anyway, let's talk about the elevation

00:21:47.920 --> 00:21:49.680
 that these planes are flying at.

00:21:49.680 --> 00:21:50.800
 Jesus Christ.

00:21:50.800 --> 00:21:52.400
 Pilots often get vertigo.

00:21:52.400 --> 00:21:54.160
 It's just for Anna, that was another--

00:21:54.160 --> 00:21:55.280
 I didn't get that.

00:21:55.280 --> 00:21:57.120
 OK, I only got that that was a joke

00:21:57.120 --> 00:21:58.800
 when James said Jesus Christ after it.

00:21:58.800 --> 00:22:00.000
 Yeah, did you get the one after that,

00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:02.080
 which I didn't say Jesus Christ about?

00:22:02.080 --> 00:22:03.120
 Was it vertigo?

00:22:03.120 --> 00:22:04.960
 That seemed like an unusual word to throw in.

00:22:04.960 --> 00:22:07.600
 Look, the important point is, when they're flying,

00:22:07.600 --> 00:22:09.440
 whether it's a beautiful day,

00:22:09.440 --> 00:22:11.440
 whether they're flying over a city of blinding lights--

00:22:11.440 --> 00:22:12.240
 Jesus Christ.

00:22:12.240 --> 00:22:13.040
 Jesus Christ.

00:22:13.040 --> 00:22:13.360
 Sorry.

00:22:13.360 --> 00:22:17.200
 I do feel like I have to punctuate these now.

00:22:17.200 --> 00:22:18.720
 I've got a whole spreadsheet of these.

00:22:18.720 --> 00:22:23.520
 So they're photographing.

00:22:23.520 --> 00:22:24.240
 That's what they're for.

00:22:24.240 --> 00:22:30.480
 The spy planes, it's for taking photos of territory

00:22:30.480 --> 00:22:32.080
 the US is trying to observe.

00:22:32.080 --> 00:22:34.400
 But they still shoot on film.

00:22:34.400 --> 00:22:35.680
 And this was reported in 2018.

00:22:35.680 --> 00:22:37.360
 They're not using digital cameras at all.

00:22:37.360 --> 00:22:39.760
 They have a lens the size of a dinner plate

00:22:39.760 --> 00:22:40.800
 on the bottom of the plane.

00:22:40.800 --> 00:22:44.320
 And then apparently they FedEx the film

00:22:44.320 --> 00:22:46.480
 back to California to be analyzed.

00:22:46.480 --> 00:22:49.200
 And it has rolls of film inside at this plane,

00:22:49.200 --> 00:22:50.400
 which are two miles long.

00:22:50.400 --> 00:22:52.560
 Pretty cool.

00:22:52.560 --> 00:22:56.240
 And OK, I had no idea how good the technology was,

00:22:56.240 --> 00:23:00.000
 but they photograph all of Afghanistan every month

00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:00.960
 just to see what's going on.

00:23:00.960 --> 00:23:02.000
 What, even the edge?

00:23:03.680 --> 00:23:04.240
 Yes.

00:23:04.240 --> 00:23:05.760
 Sorry.

00:23:05.760 --> 00:23:06.400
 Jesus Christ.

00:23:06.400 --> 00:23:06.800
 There we go.

00:23:06.800 --> 00:23:10.240
 He's the guitarist in the band.

00:23:10.240 --> 00:23:12.720
 Oh, OK.

00:23:12.720 --> 00:23:14.720
 So it's a new angle of puns now.

00:23:14.720 --> 00:23:15.600
 Nice.

00:23:15.600 --> 00:23:20.080
 But the photos are so good, or the cameras are so good,

00:23:20.080 --> 00:23:21.680
 that you can differentiate between objects

00:23:21.680 --> 00:23:24.000
 which are just eight inches apart on the ground.

00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:24.720
 Wow.

00:23:24.720 --> 00:23:26.240
 Are we going to talk about chemtrails?

00:23:26.240 --> 00:23:30.000
 Let's talk about the government trying to poison us.

00:23:30.000 --> 00:23:33.200
 So chemtrails is the idea that the government

00:23:33.200 --> 00:23:37.280
 are trying to poison us by putting stuff in contrails.

00:23:37.280 --> 00:23:39.680
 Or it might be that they're trying to change the weather,

00:23:39.680 --> 00:23:41.600
 or there's lots of things that they might be doing,

00:23:41.600 --> 00:23:43.840
 and they're almost certainly not doing.

00:23:43.840 --> 00:23:46.240
 But there was a study very recently.

00:23:46.240 --> 00:23:49.520
 This was researched at the University of California, Irvine,

00:23:49.520 --> 00:23:51.680
 and the Carnegie Institution of Science.

00:23:51.680 --> 00:23:56.320
 And they asked 77 of the world's leading atmospheric scientists

00:23:56.320 --> 00:23:59.680
 if they had any evidence that the government

00:23:59.680 --> 00:24:03.200
 was spraying stuff out of airplanes, changing the atmosphere,

00:24:03.200 --> 00:24:06.080
 or controlling overpopulation, or controlling food supply,

00:24:06.080 --> 00:24:06.560
 or whatever.

00:24:06.560 --> 00:24:10.720
 76 of them said there is no evidence whatsoever.

00:24:10.720 --> 00:24:15.120
 And one of them didn't say that there was no evidence.

00:24:15.120 --> 00:24:18.960
 And so, obviously, people just jumped on that and went,

00:24:18.960 --> 00:24:20.560
 "Yes, but what about that one guy?"

00:24:20.560 --> 00:24:24.560
 But all he was doing was basically, there was an area

00:24:24.560 --> 00:24:28.080
 which had high levels of barium, which there was currently

00:24:28.080 --> 00:24:29.520
 no explanation for.

00:24:29.520 --> 00:24:32.720
 And he was simply not ruling out the possibility

00:24:32.720 --> 00:24:35.120
 that someone could have dropped it from an airplane.

00:24:35.120 --> 00:24:37.120
 There are a million other things that it could be,

00:24:37.120 --> 00:24:40.640
 but he just, as a scientist, like scientists do,

00:24:40.640 --> 00:24:43.120
 until you have the evidence to rule it out, not ruling it out.

00:24:43.120 --> 00:24:45.280
 And that's why he said, you know...

00:24:45.280 --> 00:24:47.840
 Well, it sounds very suspect to me, that's all I'm saying.

00:24:47.840 --> 00:24:51.360
 No, the sad thing about chemtrails,

00:24:51.360 --> 00:24:55.120
 the really ironic thing about people who believe in chemtrails,

00:24:55.120 --> 00:24:57.520
 is that I think currently, the predominant belief

00:24:57.520 --> 00:24:59.760
 is that the reason the government are apparently

00:24:59.760 --> 00:25:01.920
 putting these chemicals into contrails

00:25:01.920 --> 00:25:04.080
 is to mitigate global warming.

00:25:04.080 --> 00:25:07.120
 So, people believe that to mitigate global warming,

00:25:07.120 --> 00:25:09.120
 chemicals are being sprayed up into the atmosphere

00:25:09.120 --> 00:25:11.280
 to block the heat from the sun.

00:25:11.280 --> 00:25:13.120
 And so, stop the planet warming.

00:25:13.120 --> 00:25:15.040
 But people think that these chemicals

00:25:15.040 --> 00:25:17.520
 are very bad for our health and very bad for the environment.

00:25:17.520 --> 00:25:19.440
 Therefore, they're being kept a secret.

00:25:19.440 --> 00:25:23.040
 However, the truth is that contrails are extremely bad

00:25:23.040 --> 00:25:24.080
 for global warming.

00:25:24.080 --> 00:25:26.160
 So, I had no idea about this.

00:25:26.160 --> 00:25:27.840
 But it's so interesting.

00:25:27.840 --> 00:25:30.640
 Basically, the kind of cloud they essentially create,

00:25:30.640 --> 00:25:32.560
 like a fake cirrus cloud,

00:25:32.560 --> 00:25:34.480
 is one of those really wispy ones.

00:25:34.480 --> 00:25:37.600
 And so, what that means is it lets almost all the sunlight through,

00:25:37.600 --> 00:25:40.800
 but it traps all the heat underneath.

00:25:40.800 --> 00:25:42.560
 And so, it does the opposite of clouds,

00:25:42.560 --> 00:25:44.400
 which at least don't let any sunlight through.

00:25:44.400 --> 00:25:47.200
 So, like big, big thick clouds don't let sunlight through,

00:25:47.200 --> 00:25:48.720
 but they still trap heat.

00:25:48.720 --> 00:25:50.320
 And there's a study done that showed

00:25:50.320 --> 00:25:55.200
 that they are the main cause of aviation-based climate change.

00:25:55.200 --> 00:25:58.080
 So, when it looked at how much climate change

00:25:58.080 --> 00:25:59.280
 was affected by various things,

00:25:59.280 --> 00:26:01.440
 50% was due to contrails,

00:26:01.440 --> 00:26:03.120
 trapping the heat in and letting light through.

00:26:03.120 --> 00:26:06.080
 And only 34% was carbon dioxide,

00:26:06.080 --> 00:26:07.360
 which has to be qualified

00:26:07.360 --> 00:26:10.000
 with the fact that carbon dioxide stays in the atmosphere for ages,

00:26:10.000 --> 00:26:13.200
 whereas the contrails are gone as soon as they've gone.

00:26:13.200 --> 00:26:15.040
 But even so, I find that amazing.

00:26:15.040 --> 00:26:16.480
 They're causing a massive, massive problem.

00:26:16.480 --> 00:26:17.520
 Yeah, it's amazing.

00:26:17.520 --> 00:26:20.000
 And that's why we need to find a way these days

00:26:20.000 --> 00:26:21.440
 to not have the contrails.

00:26:21.440 --> 00:26:23.120
 In the olden days, it was to stop the enemy

00:26:23.120 --> 00:26:24.800
 from seeing where your plane is,

00:26:24.800 --> 00:26:27.280
 but now it's trying to help the environment.

00:26:27.280 --> 00:26:30.960
 And there is a new system called Satavia,

00:26:30.960 --> 00:26:34.720
 which uses AI to work out where in the world all of the...

00:26:34.720 --> 00:26:38.560
 What did you call them? Moistly areas?

00:26:38.560 --> 00:26:39.520
 Dan, I can't remember.

00:26:39.520 --> 00:26:41.200
 Moisty. The moisty bits.

00:26:41.200 --> 00:26:43.200
 The high-moistier areas.

00:26:43.200 --> 00:26:46.400
 And kind of sets up a map and can tell aeroplanes

00:26:46.400 --> 00:26:49.920
 when to move into areas with low moisture.

00:26:49.920 --> 00:26:51.680
 So, they don't have as many contrails.

00:26:51.680 --> 00:26:53.120
 Just one other thing to say about contrails

00:26:53.120 --> 00:26:55.040
 is that the reason that they're bad...

00:26:55.040 --> 00:26:56.320
 We know the reason they're bad,

00:26:56.320 --> 00:26:57.920
 but the reason they're so effective

00:26:57.920 --> 00:27:01.200
 is that it's not just one plane that's leaving a trail in the sky.

00:27:01.200 --> 00:27:04.960
 It's dozens of planes flying the same route, basically.

00:27:04.960 --> 00:27:06.720
 And so, rather than just one line in the sky,

00:27:06.720 --> 00:27:10.400
 it's kind of like a massive string vest for the entire planet,

00:27:10.400 --> 00:27:12.240
 which is obviously very good at keeping in heat.

00:27:12.240 --> 00:27:14.480
 Interesting.

00:27:14.480 --> 00:27:15.680
 That's the problem, really.

00:27:15.680 --> 00:27:18.720
 It's amazing because there's so much sky

00:27:18.720 --> 00:27:22.640
 that you would think that a number of planes

00:27:22.640 --> 00:27:25.440
 wouldn't be enough contrail to make a difference.

00:27:25.440 --> 00:27:29.120
 There's a lot of sky when you look up, you know?

00:27:29.120 --> 00:27:31.280
 Yeah, that's where to look to find the sky.

00:27:31.280 --> 00:27:34.560
 I can't deny that. There's a lot of planes, though.

00:27:34.560 --> 00:27:39.600
 There are, yeah, but I'm not seeing Andy's string vest

00:27:39.600 --> 00:27:40.880
 in the sky every day, you know?

00:27:40.880 --> 00:27:42.720
 That's what I mean. There's not much of a string vest,

00:27:42.720 --> 00:27:43.840
 but it keeps you warm.

00:27:43.840 --> 00:27:47.600
 Very stringy string vest. Very revealing.

00:27:47.600 --> 00:27:50.720
 Very sexy string vest.

00:27:51.840 --> 00:27:54.080
 The other planets are dreadfully jealous of Earth.

00:27:54.080 --> 00:27:55.760
 Let's see get off.

00:27:55.760 --> 00:28:05.120
 Okay, it is time for fact number three, and that is my fact.

00:28:05.120 --> 00:28:08.080
 My fact this week is that in 12th century China,

00:28:08.080 --> 00:28:11.040
 judges used to wear sunglasses in the courtroom.

00:28:11.040 --> 00:28:13.760
 Cool judges.

00:28:13.760 --> 00:28:16.480
 Or because it was sunny in the courtroom.

00:28:16.480 --> 00:28:18.400
 Nope. No, they were indoors.

00:28:19.120 --> 00:28:23.760
 This was a thing that was done in order to hide the emotion

00:28:23.760 --> 00:28:28.000
 of the judges as they were taking the case on

00:28:28.000 --> 00:28:30.080
 so that no one could read what they were thinking.

00:28:30.080 --> 00:28:33.840
 It was just a very clever way of putting on these quartz glasses.

00:28:33.840 --> 00:28:35.680
 They're made of quartz, and you'd be like,

00:28:35.680 --> 00:28:36.880
 "What's he thinking? What's he thinking?"

00:28:36.880 --> 00:28:39.680
 "I don't know. He's got his cool sunnies on."

00:28:39.680 --> 00:28:40.560
 So, yeah.

00:28:40.560 --> 00:28:43.520
 That's cool that it's quartz for the courts.

00:28:43.520 --> 00:28:45.200
 Nice, I bet they must have gotten up so good

00:28:45.200 --> 00:28:46.480
 in their advertising.

00:28:46.480 --> 00:28:51.520
 Very true. I'm sure ancient China specifically had the word quartz and quartz.

00:28:51.520 --> 00:28:52.000
 I think so.

00:28:52.000 --> 00:29:00.400
 Yeah, and this is a fact which has led to what I think is an incredibly fun

00:29:00.400 --> 00:29:05.520
 set of emails between James and Anna in terms of trying to verify.

00:29:05.520 --> 00:29:07.520
 Could we quickly talk about that for a second?

00:29:07.520 --> 00:29:09.360
 Anna, you've been trying to verify this fact

00:29:09.360 --> 00:29:11.360
 for the last five years, it turns out.

00:29:11.360 --> 00:29:15.680
 It's been a long, long slog, and I think it's probably true.

00:29:15.680 --> 00:29:19.360
 It's cited in - what's the guy called?

00:29:19.360 --> 00:29:22.000
 James, then you joined the Getting Very Obsessed bandwagon.

00:29:22.000 --> 00:29:23.360
 Kind of overtook me, I think.

00:29:23.360 --> 00:29:24.720
 Joseph Needham.

00:29:24.720 --> 00:29:27.840
 Joseph Needham is like the historian of ancient China

00:29:27.840 --> 00:29:31.760
 who does cite an original source saying that this is why judges did it, right?

00:29:31.760 --> 00:29:32.480
 Yeah, he does.

00:29:32.480 --> 00:29:39.680
 He says that someone called Liu Qi wrote in a book called Xia Ji Qi.

00:29:39.680 --> 00:29:43.760
 Now, I don't find any evidence that these books or this person exists

00:29:43.760 --> 00:29:47.600
 anywhere else, but it could be because the internet isn't great on 12th century China.

00:29:47.600 --> 00:29:55.440
 But he says that they wrote about this guy called Xi Qiang, who was a judge who used them.

00:29:55.440 --> 00:29:58.640
 But he does say in a footnote in the bigger version of his book,

00:29:58.640 --> 00:30:02.320
 this piece of information, which I fully believe to be true,

00:30:02.320 --> 00:30:06.880
 comes from a paper on fire pearls and spectacles by Pi,

00:30:06.880 --> 00:30:11.120
 which though interesting, is full of serious and misleading mistakes.

00:30:11.760 --> 00:30:17.280
 So he's only got it from this one source and he says that the source is unreliable.

00:30:17.280 --> 00:30:20.160
 But he actually believes it and Anna believes it.

00:30:20.160 --> 00:30:24.160
 And if those two believe it, then I've got to say I have to believe it as well.

00:30:24.160 --> 00:30:24.800
 Yeah.

00:30:24.800 --> 00:30:26.480
 Needham's got the instinct, you know?

00:30:26.480 --> 00:30:29.360
 He can feel his way around ancient China in a way we can't.

00:30:29.360 --> 00:30:31.360
 If he thinks it's true, surely.

00:30:31.360 --> 00:30:33.520
 Well, Needham is extraordinary, isn't he?

00:30:33.520 --> 00:30:39.120
 I mean, this guy was the authority on the old science of ancient China.

00:30:39.120 --> 00:30:44.320
 Yeah, he was visited by three Chinese students in 1937

00:30:44.320 --> 00:30:46.400
 and suddenly got really interested in China.

00:30:46.400 --> 00:30:50.800
 And he spent three years setting up an office in China

00:30:50.800 --> 00:30:54.560
 and going up and down the whole of the country trying to find all these different sources.

00:30:54.560 --> 00:31:00.160
 And his book was described as perhaps the greatest single act of historical

00:31:00.160 --> 00:31:05.200
 synthesis and intercultural communication ever attempted by one man.

00:31:05.200 --> 00:31:06.720
 It's incredible.

00:31:06.720 --> 00:31:10.240
 And you know all these things where we say, oh, this was invented in China.

00:31:10.240 --> 00:31:11.680
 This was invented in China.

00:31:11.680 --> 00:31:15.280
 So many of them are basically down to this one guy's research.

00:31:15.280 --> 00:31:17.680
 So if you thought James and I were getting obsessive,

00:31:17.680 --> 00:31:20.880
 he really is the pinnacle, isn't he, of going over the top.

00:31:20.880 --> 00:31:23.520
 He was a pretty extraordinary guy.

00:31:23.520 --> 00:31:30.880
 He, during World War II, he lobbied for UNESCO to basically add the S in UNESCO.

00:31:30.880 --> 00:31:35.360
 There's a thing that is said that he is responsible for the S in UNESCO, which is science.

00:31:36.480 --> 00:31:39.360
 Yeah. So it was United Nations, educational and cultural.

00:31:39.360 --> 00:31:42.160
 So it was UNESCO and then he was like, no, no, come on guys.

00:31:42.160 --> 00:31:43.760
 It scans way better as well, doesn't it?

00:31:43.760 --> 00:31:45.760
 Yeah, definitely does.

00:31:45.760 --> 00:31:49.600
 I guess we should say he's one of the first ever sunglasses.

00:31:49.600 --> 00:31:56.560
 And well, I'm sure they're pretty old sunglasses, you know, 800 years, 900 years.

00:31:56.560 --> 00:32:03.200
 But we think that the first sunglasses were Inuit invention.

00:32:03.200 --> 00:32:09.120
 And they were kind of goggles to prevent snow blindness made of carved wood or bone.

00:32:09.120 --> 00:32:14.160
 And it can be really dangerous if you're exposed to ultraviolet light too much.

00:32:14.160 --> 00:32:17.760
 And obviously when the sunlight bounces off the snow and into your eyes, that can happen.

00:32:17.760 --> 00:32:21.840
 So these are about 2000 years old, perhaps older, perhaps four.

00:32:21.840 --> 00:32:24.800
 And they've got a strap made from walrus hide.

00:32:24.800 --> 00:32:28.960
 Do you remember we did ages ago, we talked about how they made everything out of walrus hide.

00:32:28.960 --> 00:32:31.200
 Well, these goggles were no exception.

00:32:31.200 --> 00:32:33.920
 And so they're more snow goggles, I guess, than sunglasses.

00:32:33.920 --> 00:32:36.720
 But they're a pretty good candidate, I reckon.

00:32:36.720 --> 00:32:38.960
 There's no glass in them for a start.

00:32:38.960 --> 00:32:39.920
 Okay, all right.

00:32:39.920 --> 00:32:49.920
 First tinted like glass glass sunglasses, I think, were from the place where you got

00:32:49.920 --> 00:32:52.080
 all the best glass, really, which was Venice.

00:32:52.080 --> 00:32:56.720
 I think we've talked about them before, how Venice had this amazing glass industry.

00:32:56.720 --> 00:32:58.800
 And they made lots of mirrors and things like that.

00:32:59.680 --> 00:33:04.480
 These were called Galdoni glasses, and they were made in the late 18th century.

00:33:04.480 --> 00:33:07.840
 And they weren't made by Galdoni, but they were popularized by him.

00:33:07.840 --> 00:33:12.880
 He was a playwright, and he always wore these particular like tinted glasses.

00:33:12.880 --> 00:33:14.160
 And everyone kind of copied him.

00:33:14.160 --> 00:33:17.440
 All the gondoliers would wear them on the canals.

00:33:17.440 --> 00:33:23.840
 And the other interesting thing about Carlo Galdoni is he is the person who wrote "One Man, Two Governors".

00:33:23.840 --> 00:33:25.360
 Did he?

00:33:25.360 --> 00:33:27.520
 Oh, he did.

00:33:27.520 --> 00:33:29.040
 James Gordon knows everything to him.

00:33:29.760 --> 00:33:30.640
 Exactly.

00:33:30.640 --> 00:33:35.600
 He wrote an Italian, obviously, play called "The Servant of Two Masters",

00:33:35.600 --> 00:33:37.600
 which was adapted into that play.

00:33:37.600 --> 00:33:38.240
 Very cool.

00:33:38.240 --> 00:33:40.720
 Wow, yeah, it was a huge deal, wasn't it?

00:33:40.720 --> 00:33:43.760
 As I suppose you have to be to set an actual trend.

00:33:43.760 --> 00:33:48.880
 But he moved Italy away from Comedia dell'Arto and into more realism.

00:33:48.880 --> 00:33:54.400
 But he did wear green glasses, which is, well, it's kind of comedic.

00:33:54.400 --> 00:33:57.680
 But yeah, the lenses tend to be green on those old glasses,

00:33:57.680 --> 00:33:59.040
 because that reflects the sun best.

00:33:59.040 --> 00:34:02.000
 And they were designed specifically for anyone on the water,

00:34:02.000 --> 00:34:04.400
 because of the glare of the water.

00:34:04.400 --> 00:34:08.240
 So all gondoliers had these like, um, Wizard of Oz type glasses.

00:34:08.240 --> 00:34:08.880
 How cool.

00:34:08.880 --> 00:34:09.440
 So cool.

00:34:09.440 --> 00:34:11.600
 There was that thing about Plenty of the Elder as well.

00:34:11.600 --> 00:34:14.400
 Wasn't there just talking about green tinted glasses,

00:34:14.400 --> 00:34:19.680
 where he said, well, he wrote that the Emperor Nero would watch Gladiator matches through emeralds.

00:34:19.680 --> 00:34:22.320
 Which it seems really far from.

00:34:22.320 --> 00:34:24.560
 Yeah, it sounds like he's never seen an emerald.

00:34:24.560 --> 00:34:28.480
 I mean, what would the possible point be?

00:34:28.480 --> 00:34:30.800
 Um, oh, hey, maybe Nero was doing it,

00:34:30.800 --> 00:34:34.160
 because I know a physical effect that wearing sunglasses has.

00:34:34.160 --> 00:34:35.360
 It makes your heart smaller.

00:34:35.360 --> 00:34:37.200
 Does it?

00:34:37.200 --> 00:34:38.000
 Not literally.

00:34:38.000 --> 00:34:41.920
 Oh, well, it makes you give less money to just giving.

00:34:41.920 --> 00:34:42.720
 Yeah, it does.

00:34:42.720 --> 00:34:45.840
 Oh, that makes sense, because it sort of removes you from a situation.

00:34:45.840 --> 00:34:46.800
 This is my guess.

00:34:46.800 --> 00:34:48.400
 That is the answer.

00:34:48.400 --> 00:34:52.000
 Yeah, it makes you a bit more anonymous, not completely anonymous.

00:34:52.000 --> 00:34:55.920
 But if you're more anonymous, you are less inhibited,

00:34:55.920 --> 00:34:59.440
 basically, from giving away to your selfish base instincts.

00:34:59.440 --> 00:35:02.080
 And so they did an experiment at the University of Toronto.

00:35:02.080 --> 00:35:06.000
 They got 80 volunteers and they said, right, we're going to give you six dollars,

00:35:06.000 --> 00:35:08.080
 not a life-changing sum of money.

00:35:08.080 --> 00:35:12.240
 And we want you to split it with someone else who's in the next room, let's say.

00:35:12.240 --> 00:35:15.280
 And half of the people they did were just with, you know, nude face,

00:35:15.280 --> 00:35:17.280
 and half of them were wearing sunglasses.

00:35:17.280 --> 00:35:20.880
 And people who were nude face, panic.

00:35:21.680 --> 00:35:24.560
 People who were in nude face.

00:35:24.560 --> 00:35:26.720
 Oh, actually, they weren't even in nude face.

00:35:26.720 --> 00:35:28.320
 I think they were wearing normal glasses.

00:35:28.320 --> 00:35:29.120
 What's going on?

00:35:29.120 --> 00:35:33.360
 Are these are these all you two songs that I've never heard of?

00:35:33.360 --> 00:35:37.360
 It sounds like you're really shoehorn in some weird words into these sentences.

00:35:37.360 --> 00:35:39.680
 Have you never heard their hit album, Nude Face?

00:35:39.680 --> 00:35:41.680
 Oh, my God, James, it's a revelation.

00:35:41.680 --> 00:35:43.520
 He's the bass player, I thought.

00:35:43.520 --> 00:35:47.280
 Basically, people who were wearing clear lenses,

00:35:47.280 --> 00:35:52.480
 so more identifiable, they gave away $2.71 of the six dollars they've been given.

00:35:52.480 --> 00:35:54.880
 So pretty nearly even Stevens, on average.

00:35:54.880 --> 00:35:58.080
 People in shades gave away only $1.81.

00:35:58.080 --> 00:36:01.200
 So they get more than four of the six dollars for themselves.

00:36:01.200 --> 00:36:04.960
 So that indicates that people are more willing to be a bit more selfish

00:36:04.960 --> 00:36:07.680
 if they are hidden and anonymous in sunglasses.

00:36:07.680 --> 00:36:08.720
 Makes total sense.

00:36:08.720 --> 00:36:13.680
 You know, when you see like a fashionable, wealthy looking lady wearing huge

00:36:13.680 --> 00:36:16.960
 Audrey Hepburn style sunglasses, you do kind of think, I bet you're a dig.

00:36:17.920 --> 00:36:20.320
 Turns out, they are.

00:36:20.320 --> 00:36:21.840
 But then when they take the glasses off,

00:36:21.840 --> 00:36:23.760
 they magically transform into a nice person again.

00:36:23.760 --> 00:36:24.720
 Is that right?

00:36:24.720 --> 00:36:25.440
 Yeah.

00:36:25.440 --> 00:36:28.720
 You know, he's not a dick who a lot of people thought was a dick for wearing glasses.

00:36:28.720 --> 00:36:30.720
 Bono, from you two.

00:36:30.720 --> 00:36:31.040
 No.

00:36:31.040 --> 00:36:37.040
 Bono, very famously, wears glasses indoors, everywhere, never has them off.

00:36:37.040 --> 00:36:40.000
 But it turns out, and he revealed this on the Graham Norton show back in, I think,

00:36:40.000 --> 00:36:44.320
 it was 2017, that he has them on permanently because of a medical condition.

00:36:45.280 --> 00:36:47.600
 Yeah. So he suffers from glaucoma.

00:36:47.600 --> 00:36:51.200
 And it means that his eyes, if there's too much light in them,

00:36:51.200 --> 00:36:56.000
 swell up massively and can have huge problems, loss of eyesight, long term.

00:36:56.000 --> 00:37:00.080
 And so for someone who plays stadium gigs and is constantly having

00:37:00.080 --> 00:37:03.840
 lights flashing in front of him, he could have been blind many, many years ago.

00:37:03.840 --> 00:37:07.200
 So that's the simple reason why he wears the glasses.

00:37:07.200 --> 00:37:08.880
 Everyone thought he was being a dick.

00:37:08.880 --> 00:37:11.520
 Well, why didn't you tell us all 20, 30 years ago,

00:37:11.520 --> 00:37:14.000
 before you let us all make fools of ourselves, taking a piss out of him?

00:37:14.000 --> 00:37:14.880
 Because he's a rock star.

00:37:14.880 --> 00:37:16.160
 He needs to come across as a dick.

00:37:16.160 --> 00:37:17.760
 Oh, yeah, fair enough.

00:37:17.760 --> 00:37:18.640
 The cash 20, too.

00:37:18.640 --> 00:37:21.440
 Does glaucoma come on more as you get older as well?

00:37:21.440 --> 00:37:25.520
 So maybe he was a dick and he's just now a dick with an excuse.

00:37:25.520 --> 00:37:27.120
 Wow.

00:37:27.120 --> 00:37:28.080
 Also going there.

00:37:28.080 --> 00:37:30.000
 Possibly, I don't know.

00:37:30.000 --> 00:37:30.880
 Possibly.

00:37:30.880 --> 00:37:31.360
 I don't know.

00:37:31.360 --> 00:37:33.360
 You know Ray Ban.

00:37:33.360 --> 00:37:34.320
 Yeah.

00:37:34.320 --> 00:37:41.440
 And Armani and Bulgari and Burberry and Chanel and Dolce and Gabana and Prada and Versace.

00:37:42.240 --> 00:37:48.880
 And Sunglasses Hut and Oakley and Target Optical and pretty much every kind of sunglasses you can name.

00:37:48.880 --> 00:37:56.320
 They're all owned by the same people, by the Luxot Teacher Group, which is an Italian group.

00:37:56.320 --> 00:38:05.040
 They sell about a billion pairs of lenses and frames every year on all these different brand names.

00:38:05.040 --> 00:38:08.800
 So some of them they own and some of them they make the sunglasses for the company

00:38:08.800 --> 00:38:10.240
 that is owned by someone else.

00:38:10.960 --> 00:38:15.120
 And this company is owned by a guy called Leonardo Delvecchio,

00:38:15.120 --> 00:38:18.000
 who was the son of a vegetable peddler.

00:38:18.000 --> 00:38:23.440
 And he was sent to an orphanage at age seven because his mother was widowed

00:38:23.440 --> 00:38:26.160
 and couldn't afford to support all of her children.

00:38:26.160 --> 00:38:31.040
 And then when he became a teenager, he started working at a car parts place.

00:38:31.040 --> 00:38:34.320
 And then at the age of 14, he put himself through design school.

00:38:34.320 --> 00:38:36.880
 And now he's the second richest man in the whole of Italy.

00:38:36.880 --> 00:38:38.080
 Wow.

00:38:38.080 --> 00:38:38.800
 Wow.

00:38:38.800 --> 00:38:39.360
 Yeah.

00:38:39.360 --> 00:38:39.840
 God.

00:38:39.840 --> 00:38:40.560
 That's extraordinary.

00:38:40.560 --> 00:38:41.520
 Amazing.

00:38:41.520 --> 00:38:43.920
 Sounds like they just had a big brainstorm coming up with names.

00:38:43.920 --> 00:38:45.440
 Couldn't decide to use all of them.

00:38:45.440 --> 00:38:50.320
 And then why not just sell the one brand?

00:38:50.320 --> 00:38:51.040
 It's confusing.

00:38:51.040 --> 00:38:51.920
 One a bit of variety.

00:38:51.920 --> 00:38:53.600
 I like sunglasses hut best of all.

00:38:53.600 --> 00:38:54.880
 All right.

00:38:54.880 --> 00:38:55.920
 Well, what about Ray?

00:38:55.920 --> 00:38:58.000
 Do you know where the name Ray band comes from?

00:38:58.000 --> 00:39:03.520
 I assumed there was a Ray involved, as in it was like Max Factor,

00:39:03.520 --> 00:39:04.480
 who was a real person, wasn't he?

00:39:04.480 --> 00:39:05.200
 Max Factor was real.

00:39:05.200 --> 00:39:06.240
 So I assumed that there was a Ray band.

00:39:06.240 --> 00:39:09.360
 It was called Maximilian Factorovich or something.

00:39:09.360 --> 00:39:10.160
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:39:10.160 --> 00:39:10.880
 That's right.

00:39:10.880 --> 00:39:14.080
 So I assumed it was Raymond Banneveld or whatever.

00:39:14.080 --> 00:39:15.840
 Did you not do what I did, Andy, which is think,

00:39:15.840 --> 00:39:18.880
 I literally went through that exact process thinking,

00:39:18.880 --> 00:39:21.040
 Ray band, I wonder if there's a Ray band,

00:39:21.040 --> 00:39:23.760
 and then you get three seconds into that thought and you go,

00:39:23.760 --> 00:39:25.680
 Oh no, wait, they banish rays.

00:39:25.680 --> 00:39:27.440
 I never got to that second part of the process.

00:39:27.440 --> 00:39:28.400
 There you go.

00:39:28.400 --> 00:39:32.000
 But they did the, they did those big aviators glasses, didn't they?

00:39:32.000 --> 00:39:33.520
 Was it, was that Ray band?

00:39:33.520 --> 00:39:34.000
 I think so.

00:39:34.000 --> 00:39:34.480
 Yeah.

00:39:34.480 --> 00:39:34.800
 Yeah.

00:39:34.800 --> 00:39:35.760
 Yeah, invented the aviators.

00:39:35.760 --> 00:39:38.240
 They were designed by a guy called John McCready.

00:39:38.240 --> 00:39:43.600
 And John McCready, as well as designing these aviator sunglasses,

00:39:43.600 --> 00:39:48.160
 he was the first person to test fly a crop duster airplane.

00:39:48.160 --> 00:39:54.720
 He set three altitude records flying up to 35,000 feet-ish,

00:39:54.720 --> 00:39:56.400
 the first person to do that.

00:39:56.400 --> 00:40:01.200
 He set the world endurance record of flying for over 35 hours,

00:40:01.200 --> 00:40:02.960
 35 hours and 18 minutes.

00:40:02.960 --> 00:40:07.280
 He made the first non-stop coast-to-coast flight across America.

00:40:07.280 --> 00:40:12.400
 And he did the first aircraft engine repair while it was flying.

00:40:12.400 --> 00:40:14.640
 So replaying an engine while the plane was flying.

00:40:14.640 --> 00:40:15.200
 Oh, wow.

00:40:15.200 --> 00:40:20.400
 And he became the first ever pilot to bail out of an aircraft at night.

00:40:20.400 --> 00:40:24.480
 He did all those things and the invented or designed the aviator sunglasses.

00:40:24.480 --> 00:40:26.320
 It's amazing.

00:40:26.320 --> 00:40:31.360
 There's such a terrifying story about when he did break the altitude record,

00:40:31.360 --> 00:40:33.600
 which is that his friend was actually trying to break it.

00:40:33.600 --> 00:40:35.120
 A guy called Shorty Schroeder.

00:40:35.120 --> 00:40:36.960
 This was in 1920.

00:40:36.960 --> 00:40:42.480
 And this guy went up and at the time before they had your aviator sunglasses,

00:40:42.480 --> 00:40:43.280
 they wore goggles.

00:40:43.280 --> 00:40:45.920
 And because they were going up so high and it was incredibly cold,

00:40:45.920 --> 00:40:51.040
 like minus 50 degrees, they wore goggles with fur lining.

00:40:51.040 --> 00:40:53.600
 And if your eye was even a split second exposed,

00:40:53.600 --> 00:40:56.480
 then you're absolutely buggered because it's far too cold for an eye to survive.

00:40:56.480 --> 00:41:00.080
 So this guy Shorty went up and his goggles completely fogged up

00:41:00.080 --> 00:41:01.520
 so he couldn't see a thing.

00:41:01.520 --> 00:41:04.480
 And he had no choice except to rip them off his face so he could see.

00:41:04.480 --> 00:41:06.960
 And within moments, his vision went really blurred

00:41:06.960 --> 00:41:09.120
 and his eyes completely froze over.

00:41:09.120 --> 00:41:11.840
 So my God.

00:41:11.840 --> 00:41:13.600
 All the liquid in his eyes froze.

00:41:13.600 --> 00:41:15.520
 Somehow his eyeballs frozen.

00:41:15.520 --> 00:41:17.600
 He managed to land and it was John McReady,

00:41:17.600 --> 00:41:19.920
 his friend who pulled him out of the cockpit and said,

00:41:19.920 --> 00:41:23.280
 "All right, mate. Nice try. Bad luck about the goggles."

00:41:23.280 --> 00:41:24.640
 Then he broke the record.

00:41:24.640 --> 00:41:27.840
 Then he went and found the sunglasses manufacturers and went right.

00:41:27.840 --> 00:41:28.960
 We better make some better glasses.

00:41:28.960 --> 00:41:29.840
 That's amazing.

00:41:29.840 --> 00:41:33.600
 Because I was just thinking, like quite often when I talk to people,

00:41:33.600 --> 00:41:35.280
 their eyes just kind of glaze over.

00:41:35.280 --> 00:41:38.320
 And I wonder if it's due to the temperature perhaps.

00:41:38.320 --> 00:41:39.760
 That's what it is, James.

00:41:39.760 --> 00:41:42.000
 It's the lofty, lofty conversation you have, James.

00:41:42.000 --> 00:41:44.400
 It simulates the altitude of 35,000 feet.

00:41:44.400 --> 00:41:45.120
 It's incredible.

00:41:45.120 --> 00:41:51.360
 You know, do you know progressive lenses in glasses?

00:41:51.360 --> 00:41:57.440
 What these are, you can have bifocals where half of them are for short-sighted

00:41:57.440 --> 00:41:58.720
 and half of them are for long-sighted.

00:41:58.720 --> 00:42:00.480
 And you look in different parts of your glasses

00:42:00.480 --> 00:42:04.800
 and you can, depending on what you're looking at, a progressive lens.

00:42:04.800 --> 00:42:08.480
 It still has your short-sighted bits and your long-sighted bits,

00:42:08.480 --> 00:42:10.640
 but they're kind of blended into each other.

00:42:10.640 --> 00:42:12.560
 So you're never jumping from one to the other.

00:42:12.560 --> 00:42:17.760
 And the first US patent for one of these was by a woman called Dr. Estelle Glancy.

00:42:17.760 --> 00:42:20.400
 And she, as well as invented that.

00:42:20.400 --> 00:42:23.280
 Oh, yeah, Glancy.

00:42:23.280 --> 00:42:24.560
 I thought that was the whole point.

00:42:24.560 --> 00:42:25.760
 Yeah, I thought that was the point.

00:42:25.760 --> 00:42:26.560
 That's the point.

00:42:26.560 --> 00:42:28.720
 You know what?

00:42:28.720 --> 00:42:32.240
 I mean, so many of my facts are just this person's got a funny name.

00:42:32.240 --> 00:42:34.800
 I do see why you thought that was the end of it.

00:42:34.800 --> 00:42:38.320
 But she also invented the first lens testing machine.

00:42:38.320 --> 00:42:41.360
 And that is still used in most opticians today, her invention.

00:42:41.360 --> 00:42:47.840
 And from 1918 to 1950, when she worked in the industry,

00:42:47.840 --> 00:42:54.320
 she was the only female lens designer in the whole world for 32 years.

00:42:54.320 --> 00:42:55.840
 She was the only one.

00:42:55.840 --> 00:42:57.520
 Everyone else who did it was a man.

00:42:57.520 --> 00:43:03.040
 And on the website for Zeiss, who's like a kind of an optical company,

00:43:03.040 --> 00:43:06.400
 they said that women have faced a glass ceiling in many fields,

00:43:06.400 --> 00:43:10.240
 but the glass ceiling in glasses may have been the toughest to break through.

00:43:10.240 --> 00:43:11.760
 Brilliant.

00:43:11.760 --> 00:43:12.720
 There's a great line, isn't there?

00:43:12.720 --> 00:43:16.480
 But now women make up more than 76% of opticians in the US.

00:43:16.480 --> 00:43:18.880
 So it's gotten better, certainly.

00:43:18.880 --> 00:43:19.760
 We've made it.

00:43:19.760 --> 00:43:20.800
 I'm really cool.

00:43:20.800 --> 00:43:22.480
 Progressive lens sounds like a lens.

00:43:22.480 --> 00:43:24.960
 That only lets you read The Guardian and the New Statesman or something.

00:43:24.960 --> 00:43:26.000
 Yeah, that's nice.

00:43:26.000 --> 00:43:27.200
 I've won Tiny.

00:43:27.200 --> 00:43:31.680
 This just made me laugh because it's to do with one of my favorite movies, Contact.

00:43:31.680 --> 00:43:35.200
 Contact the movie, Jodie Foster.

00:43:35.200 --> 00:43:39.600
 Almost got a really bizarre review from this guy called Anthony Lane,

00:43:39.600 --> 00:43:44.400
 who is an American reviewer, because he was running really late to the cinema.

00:43:44.400 --> 00:43:48.400
 And when he ran in and sat down, he forgot to take his sunglasses off.

00:43:48.400 --> 00:43:51.920
 So he watched the first three quarters of an hour with the glasses on.

00:43:51.920 --> 00:43:56.080
 And the notes that he looked back on were notes going, "Very gloomy this movie.

00:43:56.080 --> 00:43:59.520
 Odd noir look for sci-fi.

00:43:59.520 --> 00:44:02.560
 Creepy shadows in the outdoor seats."

00:44:02.560 --> 00:44:06.160
 And then suddenly realized he had his sunnies on.

00:44:06.160 --> 00:44:08.640
 He was wearing contact lenses.

00:44:08.640 --> 00:44:10.000
 Very good.

00:44:10.000 --> 00:44:12.560
 Oh, okay.

00:44:12.560 --> 00:44:15.920
 Got to move it on.

00:44:15.920 --> 00:44:21.520
 So I read a fun story from 2017 about sunglasses, specifically that police caught a man

00:44:21.520 --> 00:44:26.320
 on his phone at the wheel because he took a selfie of himself of his face.

00:44:26.320 --> 00:44:28.640
 He's wearing sunglasses and the selfie says something like,

00:44:28.640 --> 00:44:31.440
 "Single today, married tomorrow, scary times."

00:44:31.440 --> 00:44:33.040
 Something really cool like that.

00:44:33.040 --> 00:44:35.920
 And he tweeted this.

00:44:35.920 --> 00:44:39.440
 And the police in his area spotted that in the photograph,

00:44:39.440 --> 00:44:43.600
 there was the reflection in his sunglasses of his other hand on the wheel of a car

00:44:43.600 --> 00:44:46.640
 and the reflection of the view through the windscreen showing that he was mid-driving

00:44:46.640 --> 00:44:47.680
 on a dual carriageway.

00:44:49.600 --> 00:44:53.280
 Twisted at him, said, "We've got a wedding present for you and it's a Â£200 fine

00:44:53.280 --> 00:44:54.640
 and six points on your license."

00:44:54.640 --> 00:44:56.080
 They tweeted it back.

00:44:56.080 --> 00:44:58.560
 They tweeted him that and then he deleted his Twitter account.

00:44:58.560 --> 00:44:58.960
 So that's bad.

00:44:58.960 --> 00:45:01.840
 No one comes across well in that story, do they?

00:45:01.840 --> 00:45:03.840
 I don't think the police come across that well.

00:45:03.840 --> 00:45:06.240
 And obviously he's driving while selfying.

00:45:06.240 --> 00:45:07.120
 So I just think...

00:45:07.120 --> 00:45:09.520
 What you think of the police, that was a little bit.

00:45:09.520 --> 00:45:10.800
 Don't do it over Twitter, guys.

00:45:10.800 --> 00:45:12.240
 Don't do it over Twitter.

00:45:12.240 --> 00:45:15.440
 Yeah, kick the door in like traditional, you know.

00:45:15.440 --> 00:45:27.120
 Okay, it is time for our final fact of the show and that is James.

00:45:27.120 --> 00:45:31.600
 Okay, my fact this week is that there is a species of rabbit that can't hop.

00:45:31.600 --> 00:45:36.480
 So if it wants to go fast, it walks on its hands with its legs in the air.

00:45:36.480 --> 00:45:41.600
 Oh, I love these guys.

00:45:41.600 --> 00:45:42.560
 They're so cute.

00:45:44.400 --> 00:45:46.800
 You might have seen them online in the last couple of weeks.

00:45:46.800 --> 00:45:49.840
 They've done a mini viral thing on the internet.

00:45:49.840 --> 00:45:52.320
 Hopefully not too viral that some of you won't have heard of it.

00:45:52.320 --> 00:45:59.440
 But this is a species of rabbit called Sauter d'Alfort or the Alfort Jumper.

00:45:59.440 --> 00:46:01.280
 And they're a French species of rabbit.

00:46:01.280 --> 00:46:06.080
 And very recently, the reason they've got in the news is because there is a guy

00:46:06.080 --> 00:46:10.800
 called Leif Anderson and his team at Uppsala University in Sweden.

00:46:10.800 --> 00:46:16.640
 And they have worked out what the gene is that makes it unable to hop like normal rabbits.

00:46:16.640 --> 00:46:19.280
 So it's kind of a genetic problem they've got, isn't it?

00:46:19.280 --> 00:46:20.560
 It's sort of quirky.

00:46:20.560 --> 00:46:23.280
 Yeah, do they get preyed on more, I wonder?

00:46:23.280 --> 00:46:26.240
 Because they can't go that fast, maybe?

00:46:26.240 --> 00:46:29.840
 They tend to not live in the wild very much.

00:46:29.840 --> 00:46:34.400
 So the first we found out about them, there was a French vet called Etienne Leta.

00:46:34.400 --> 00:46:39.360
 And he was studying these rabbits that were unable to jump properly.

00:46:40.240 --> 00:46:44.480
 And he was breeding rabbits at the time and he'd bred a few together.

00:46:44.480 --> 00:46:47.600
 And this strain had come out, which did this weird thing.

00:46:47.600 --> 00:46:51.840
 He said that they moved exactly like a human tightrope walker walks on his hands.

00:46:51.840 --> 00:46:55.120
 So he kind of saw that association then.

00:46:55.120 --> 00:46:57.680
 But the thing is, this is a very much recessive gene.

00:46:57.680 --> 00:47:04.880
 So I think some might have escaped and some completely healthy ones have mated.

00:47:04.880 --> 00:47:07.360
 And now you get some of them in the wild that do this.

00:47:07.360 --> 00:47:10.000
 But again, they won't really last very long, I don't think.

00:47:10.000 --> 00:47:13.680
 If they did that, it's really impressive, isn't it?

00:47:13.680 --> 00:47:15.840
 Yeah, it's kind of very cool seeing them handstand the way along.

00:47:15.840 --> 00:47:17.120
 It's kind of awesome.

00:47:17.120 --> 00:47:18.160
 Oh, it's so wicked.

00:47:18.160 --> 00:47:18.480
 Yeah.

00:47:18.480 --> 00:47:20.640
 And actually, he's quite interested in Etienne Leta.

00:47:20.640 --> 00:47:26.000
 His father, Klebert Leta, was the first person to perform

00:47:26.000 --> 00:47:28.800
 artificial insemination of a horse in France.

00:47:28.800 --> 00:47:34.640
 Etienne was the first, did the first public demonstration

00:47:34.640 --> 00:47:36.960
 of insemination of a cow in France.

00:47:37.760 --> 00:47:39.680
 Is that a step up or a step down?

00:47:39.680 --> 00:47:40.880
 I can't remember.

00:47:40.880 --> 00:47:43.280
 Public, that's kind of, it's more showbiz, isn't it?

00:47:43.280 --> 00:47:43.840
 It is.

00:47:43.840 --> 00:47:47.920
 Yeah, he took his father's ponchant for insemination

00:47:47.920 --> 00:47:49.840
 and he made himself a star.

00:47:49.840 --> 00:47:51.680
 Gave it a bit of the old razzle dazzle.

00:47:51.680 --> 00:47:52.080
 Yeah.

00:47:52.080 --> 00:47:55.360
 I wonder if that's a hard show to get people to come to.

00:47:55.360 --> 00:47:57.600
 You know in Edinburgh, when you're walking through and everyone says,

00:47:57.600 --> 00:48:00.800
 "Come, we've got naked Shakespeare," or, you know, "Come to..."

00:48:00.800 --> 00:48:02.000
 "Come one, come all!"

00:48:05.360 --> 00:48:08.320
 Does anyone, you guys might not know this,

00:48:08.320 --> 00:48:11.040
 but have you ever heard of the song, "Run, Rabbit, Run"?

00:48:11.040 --> 00:48:12.560
 Oh, yeah.

00:48:12.560 --> 00:48:15.360
 "Run, Rabbit, Run, Rabbit, Run, Run, Run, Run."

00:48:15.360 --> 00:48:18.640
 "Gum's a farmer with his gum, gum, gum."

00:48:18.640 --> 00:48:21.360
 "Bang, bang, bang, goes the farmer's gum."

00:48:21.360 --> 00:48:22.160
 So, "Run, run."

00:48:22.160 --> 00:48:22.800
 Sorry, go on.

00:48:22.800 --> 00:48:23.600
 What were you going to say about it?

00:48:23.600 --> 00:48:26.800
 Is that a nursery rhyme or is that a big hit in the UK?

00:48:26.800 --> 00:48:28.960
 It was a big hit back in the day.

00:48:28.960 --> 00:48:30.240
 Flanagan and Alan sang it.

00:48:30.240 --> 00:48:32.000
 It was written by Noel Gay.

00:48:32.000 --> 00:48:35.120
 And it became a patriotic song

00:48:35.120 --> 00:48:40.320
 in World War II, where they sang "Run, Adolf, Run, Adolf, Run, Run, Run" instead.

00:48:40.320 --> 00:48:44.080
 And the reason that they got that song for World War II

00:48:44.080 --> 00:48:47.120
 is because there was a picture that was in all the newspapers

00:48:47.120 --> 00:48:50.400
 of this big sort of crater where a bum had landed

00:48:50.400 --> 00:48:53.280
 and someone was holding two rabbits and said,

00:48:53.280 --> 00:48:55.200
 "Ha, ha, Hitler, you bummed us,

00:48:55.200 --> 00:48:57.520
 but all you managed to kill was these two rabbits."

00:48:57.520 --> 00:49:00.720
 But actually, that was a setup, that picture.

00:49:00.720 --> 00:49:04.240
 And the rabbits had been bought by nearby butchers

00:49:04.240 --> 00:49:07.280
 and they'd gone to the hole in the ground and held them up.

00:49:07.280 --> 00:49:10.800
 And it was basically a bit of propaganda.

00:49:10.800 --> 00:49:13.280
 But then, as a result, this "Run, Rabbit, Run" song

00:49:13.280 --> 00:49:15.200
 became massive during World War II.

00:49:15.200 --> 00:49:15.920
 How interesting.

00:49:15.920 --> 00:49:18.640
 Because I have seen that as a fact around the internet

00:49:18.640 --> 00:49:21.760
 that the first casualty of World War II to a bum was a rabbit.

00:49:21.760 --> 00:49:22.320
 I think it was.

00:49:22.320 --> 00:49:23.360
 And it was a specific incident.

00:49:23.360 --> 00:49:24.480
 Or is this a different incident, Anna?

00:49:24.480 --> 00:49:25.680
 No, no, it's the same incident.

00:49:25.680 --> 00:49:29.440
 It's kind of propaganda, but it's just to tell a true story.

00:49:29.440 --> 00:49:31.440
 Because I believe, bizarrely, the first bum dropped

00:49:31.440 --> 00:49:32.800
 was on the Shetland Islands,

00:49:32.800 --> 00:49:36.080
 because it was the Germans trying to get some of the boats

00:49:36.080 --> 00:49:38.320
 in an inlet around the Shetland.

00:49:38.320 --> 00:49:41.440
 And what happened was, a few landed on the land

00:49:41.440 --> 00:49:43.920
 and one of them killed a rabbit.

00:49:43.920 --> 00:49:44.880
 Like, all the locals were like,

00:49:44.880 --> 00:49:47.360
 "Oh, God, this is a big crater, this poor rabbit's dead."

00:49:47.360 --> 00:49:49.520
 And there was a photographer who lived on the island

00:49:49.520 --> 00:49:52.000
 who was like, "Oh, brilliant, I'm going to go and photograph that."

00:49:52.000 --> 00:49:55.760
 But he's a smart cookie and has an eye for a good bit of press.

00:49:55.760 --> 00:49:57.440
 And so he went to the butcher on the way

00:49:57.440 --> 00:49:59.280
 to buy some rabbits to hold up,

00:49:59.280 --> 00:50:00.480
 because he knew that that rabbit

00:50:00.480 --> 00:50:01.840
 was going to be blown to smithereens.

00:50:01.840 --> 00:50:03.200
 You know what you're saying, Anna, but I don't think you can...

00:50:03.200 --> 00:50:04.400
 And then he said that that's why.

00:50:04.400 --> 00:50:06.720
 I don't think you can claim your Pulitzer Prize

00:50:06.720 --> 00:50:10.800
 if you're going buying crops for your war photos, can you?

00:50:10.800 --> 00:50:11.200
 Yeah.

00:50:11.200 --> 00:50:13.200
 Oh, come on.

00:50:13.200 --> 00:50:17.520
 It was a bit of dramatic artistic license in the face of...

00:50:17.520 --> 00:50:20.080
 Because you can't hold up the sort of butchered remains.

00:50:20.080 --> 00:50:21.120
 You have to have some rabbits, no.

00:50:21.120 --> 00:50:21.360
 Yeah.

00:50:21.360 --> 00:50:23.920
 So was there any...

00:50:23.920 --> 00:50:26.560
 Do we have a photo that's sort of like in the archives

00:50:26.560 --> 00:50:27.600
 of the butchered rabbit?

00:50:27.600 --> 00:50:29.520
 Or did someone did some farm ago,

00:50:29.520 --> 00:50:32.240
 "I'm down one rabbit. It must have landed on that."

00:50:32.240 --> 00:50:33.280
 That's a good point.

00:50:33.280 --> 00:50:34.240
 It's a big claim.

00:50:34.240 --> 00:50:35.360
 Did it land on the hutch,

00:50:35.360 --> 00:50:37.520
 or was it just a loose rabbit in a field?

00:50:37.520 --> 00:50:40.640
 And we presume that it lost its life in the...

00:50:40.640 --> 00:50:42.240
 But also, starting with the Shetlands,

00:50:42.240 --> 00:50:44.000
 feels like a very toe in the water strategy

00:50:44.000 --> 00:50:45.040
 for your bobbin campaign.

00:50:45.040 --> 00:50:49.440
 I have a plain and rabbit-related fact,

00:50:49.440 --> 00:50:50.640
 which is that in 2017,

00:50:50.640 --> 00:50:52.480
 a plane had to make an emergency landing

00:50:52.480 --> 00:50:54.320
 that was flying between Melbourne and Brisbane.

00:50:54.320 --> 00:50:55.760
 It had to make an emergency landing

00:50:55.760 --> 00:50:58.160
 after it hit an eagle and a rabbit at the same time.

00:50:58.800 --> 00:51:00.720
 Oh, wow.

00:51:00.720 --> 00:51:02.880
 It was the eagle that had caught the rabbit,

00:51:02.880 --> 00:51:04.160
 and it was flying up into the air,

00:51:04.160 --> 00:51:05.520
 and it failed to notice.

00:51:05.520 --> 00:51:06.800
 It was so intent on its lunch

00:51:06.800 --> 00:51:09.600
 that it failed to notice the plane bearing down on it.

00:51:09.600 --> 00:51:10.800
 Same questions about that.

00:51:10.800 --> 00:51:13.200
 You're flying your plane,

00:51:13.200 --> 00:51:15.760
 and I guess you could see an eagle,

00:51:15.760 --> 00:51:16.640
 but you're so fast

00:51:16.640 --> 00:51:18.400
 that you're going to collide really quick, right?

00:51:18.400 --> 00:51:20.560
 How do we know there was a rabbit there?

00:51:20.560 --> 00:51:22.320
 It's such a good question.

00:51:22.320 --> 00:51:24.320
 I just don't see how the pilot could have seen.

00:51:24.320 --> 00:51:27.120
 I don't think we're relying on the pilot's testimony.

00:51:27.120 --> 00:51:29.120
 I think they must have found some fur in the engine.

00:51:29.120 --> 00:51:32.080
 Do you think someone went to the Butchers

00:51:32.080 --> 00:51:33.040
 after the plane landed?

00:51:33.040 --> 00:51:37.760
 There's one Butcher who's doing very well.

00:51:37.760 --> 00:51:41.600
 I have dodgy journalists.

00:51:41.600 --> 00:51:46.240
 Do you know that the big reveal of the Simpsons

00:51:46.240 --> 00:51:49.120
 was meant to be that Marge Simpson was a massive rabbit?

00:51:49.120 --> 00:51:51.680
 What are you talking about?

00:51:51.680 --> 00:51:54.880
 Yeah, this is a thing Matt Groening really wanted to do,

00:51:54.880 --> 00:51:58.880
 which was he had a previous comic strip called Life in Hell,

00:51:58.880 --> 00:52:00.240
 which was about a bunch of rabbits.

00:52:00.240 --> 00:52:03.920
 Yeah, and it was a very popular comic strip for him,

00:52:03.920 --> 00:52:07.440
 and then the Simpsons became the big thing that he did.

00:52:07.440 --> 00:52:10.480
 But his big idea, which he pitched in a few meetings,

00:52:10.480 --> 00:52:14.160
 was that underneath the giant blue hair

00:52:14.160 --> 00:52:16.960
 that would one day get wet would come down

00:52:16.960 --> 00:52:20.480
 and revealed underneath would be two giant bunny rabbit ears,

00:52:20.480 --> 00:52:23.600
 and we would be shown that that universe was connected

00:52:23.600 --> 00:52:25.280
 to the Life is Hell universe.

00:52:25.280 --> 00:52:27.440
 And everyone told he was mad and not to do it

00:52:27.440 --> 00:52:28.640
 because he was going to do an episode.

00:52:28.640 --> 00:52:30.400
 Then he thought that's the long game.

00:52:30.400 --> 00:52:32.240
 We could do this as the final reveal.

00:52:32.240 --> 00:52:34.080
 So he was a massive rabbit all along.

00:52:34.080 --> 00:52:35.200
 Still waiting.

00:52:35.200 --> 00:52:36.800
 We're still waiting for that final reveal.

00:52:36.800 --> 00:52:37.680
 They talked about it.

00:52:37.680 --> 00:52:40.160
 He said in a DVD commentary that it's an old idea.

00:52:40.160 --> 00:52:43.280
 However, there was a video game that was released of the Simpsons

00:52:43.280 --> 00:52:46.400
 where in it, Marge gets electrocuted.

00:52:46.400 --> 00:52:48.880
 And you know that classic cartoon thing of electrocution

00:52:48.880 --> 00:52:52.160
 where you see the skeleton come through or the body underneath?

00:52:52.160 --> 00:52:54.000
 In it, when she gets electrocuted,

00:52:54.000 --> 00:52:57.280
 it sort of shows she has massive bunny rabbit ears.

00:52:57.280 --> 00:53:01.120
 So for one instance, she was in one part of the Simpsons universe.

00:53:01.120 --> 00:53:02.480
 She is a giant rabbit.

00:53:02.480 --> 00:53:04.640
 And that is a classic Easter egg, isn't it?

00:53:04.640 --> 00:53:06.080
 Brilliant.

00:53:06.080 --> 00:53:06.480
 Lovely.

00:53:06.480 --> 00:53:09.680
 I know my tech terms.

00:53:09.680 --> 00:53:12.720
 Rabbits are very stoic.

00:53:12.720 --> 00:53:16.960
 Didn't know this, but yeah.

00:53:16.960 --> 00:53:20.720
 So Rabbits, if they're really ill, they don't let you know.

00:53:20.720 --> 00:53:22.560
 So many rabbit owners, when their rabbits died,

00:53:22.560 --> 00:53:24.160
 they're like, it just came out of nowhere.

00:53:24.160 --> 00:53:25.440
 They weren't even sick.

00:53:25.440 --> 00:53:27.280
 But actually, they pretend to be healthy.

00:53:27.280 --> 00:53:30.480
 They're like the opposite of possums, even if they're sick.

00:53:30.480 --> 00:53:32.960
 And that's to just deflect attention from predators.

00:53:32.960 --> 00:53:34.800
 Because if a predator sees a sick rabbit, it thinks,

00:53:34.800 --> 00:53:36.000
 I'm going to catch that one.

00:53:36.000 --> 00:53:36.720
 Interesting.

00:53:36.720 --> 00:53:39.360
 And so often they will just drop dead.

00:53:39.360 --> 00:53:41.200
 But aren't they terrified of us?

00:53:41.200 --> 00:53:42.720
 Aren't they terrified of human owners?

00:53:42.720 --> 00:53:44.480
 I read a thing saying that when you pick a rabbit up

00:53:44.480 --> 00:53:45.600
 and it's all still and quiet,

00:53:45.600 --> 00:53:48.000
 it's just desperately hoping that you go away.

00:53:48.000 --> 00:53:49.360
 Yeah, they're rarely still and quiet.

00:53:49.360 --> 00:53:50.480
 If you've ever had a pet rabbit,

00:53:50.480 --> 00:53:52.880
 they will scratch your eyes out.

00:53:52.880 --> 00:53:53.520
 Right.

00:53:53.520 --> 00:53:54.160
 Oh.

00:53:54.160 --> 00:53:54.880
 They're bad pets.

00:53:54.880 --> 00:53:57.200
 They've got a pet docile and sort of calm.

00:53:57.200 --> 00:54:00.560
 No, but I think maybe your parents got a dead rabbit

00:54:00.560 --> 00:54:02.720
 from a local butcher and said it was a pet.

00:54:02.720 --> 00:54:05.040
 A bloody butcher.

00:54:05.040 --> 00:54:11.920
 You know the rabbits that were used in the Teletubbies show?

00:54:11.920 --> 00:54:16.320
 They had to be so enormous because they were,

00:54:16.320 --> 00:54:17.840
 because the Teletubbies were huge.

00:54:17.840 --> 00:54:18.320
 Right.

00:54:18.320 --> 00:54:21.040
 And it was like in a, they lived in a big field

00:54:21.040 --> 00:54:23.040
 and there was lots of rabbits jumping around all the time.

00:54:23.040 --> 00:54:23.680
 Was that so?

00:54:23.680 --> 00:54:24.160
 Exactly.

00:54:24.160 --> 00:54:24.480
 Yeah.

00:54:24.480 --> 00:54:26.160
 And they were, they were Flemish giants,

00:54:26.160 --> 00:54:28.080
 which I think are the largest rabbits on the planet.

00:54:28.080 --> 00:54:30.160
 Or they're almost the largest breed that you can get

00:54:30.160 --> 00:54:32.080
 because the Teletubbies costumes, which are so massive.

00:54:32.080 --> 00:54:34.160
 Anyway, this, I got,

00:54:34.160 --> 00:54:37.360
 I fell into a bit of a rabbit hole reading about these guys.

00:54:37.360 --> 00:54:39.920
 And the problem was, firstly,

00:54:39.920 --> 00:54:42.320
 the rabbits were always doing what rabbits do

00:54:42.320 --> 00:54:43.520
 and trying to breed with each other.

00:54:43.520 --> 00:54:44.800
 So they had to keep doing retakes

00:54:44.800 --> 00:54:46.240
 because there would be a pair of rabbits

00:54:46.240 --> 00:54:47.600
 in the background mating.

00:54:48.240 --> 00:54:50.560
 And that, anyway, that's not really relevant

00:54:50.560 --> 00:54:52.080
 because the main fact I wanted to say,

00:54:52.080 --> 00:54:53.120
 I didn't know this.

00:54:53.120 --> 00:54:56.560
 The Teletubby costumes were so enormous and ungainly

00:54:56.560 --> 00:54:58.640
 and difficult to move around in

00:54:58.640 --> 00:55:01.040
 that they had to have seats inside them

00:55:01.040 --> 00:55:03.280
 so the actors could sit down between takes.

00:55:03.280 --> 00:55:03.840
 No way.

00:55:03.840 --> 00:55:05.200
 Oh my God.

00:55:05.200 --> 00:55:06.880
 So if you see a Teletubby standing up,

00:55:06.880 --> 00:55:08.320
 you don't know whether the person inside

00:55:08.320 --> 00:55:09.520
 is sitting down or not.

00:55:09.520 --> 00:55:11.280
 Do you think the reason the baby was laughing

00:55:11.280 --> 00:55:13.440
 was because of all the rabbits mating though?

00:55:13.440 --> 00:55:16.000
 I could see his tinky winky.

00:55:16.480 --> 00:55:17.360
 Yeah.

00:55:17.360 --> 00:55:21.200
 Okay, that's it.

00:55:21.200 --> 00:55:22.240
 That is all of our facts.

00:55:22.240 --> 00:55:23.600
