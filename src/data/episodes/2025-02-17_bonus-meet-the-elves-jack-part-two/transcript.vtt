00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:21.200
 Hello and welcome to a very special bonus episode of Meet the Elf. This one with a twist because

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:26.960
 you've already met him. Let's meet him again. This is Jack Chambers, who I'm sure you remember

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:31.120
 based on everything about him. We probably don't need to go back through your history at QI unless

00:00:31.120 --> 00:00:37.360
 you have any new exciting information to tell us about yourself. No, no, I don't think so. I'm

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:42.640
 another sort of year older and bit less hair on my head and my voice hasn't changed, so maybe you

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:50.000
 recognise it. Have you become a podcaster since we last spoke? Yeah, we've basically me and Manu,

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:55.120
 who's also been on Meet the Elf, and our good friend Rosie, who's a food expert. She's a stylist

00:00:55.120 --> 00:01:02.240
 and influencer and professional chef. We have created a podcast called Lunchbox Envy and it's

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:08.000
 basically the QI approach to food, which is common to everyone. I think there are very few people

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:12.560
 except for those breatharians who don't eat food. Yeah, it's a clever subject to choose. Well done.

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:21.520
 This is not so much Meet the Elf as Reheat the Elf. Oh, yeah. Okay, I mean you actually had the

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:26.880
 word "meat" in the title there, but that's cool. That's not solely meat-based. An episode on garlic.

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:31.520
 That's true. That's the first one we're going to release on February the 24th. Right. You can

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:37.760
 find details at qi.com/lunchbox. And we've had a preview and it's great. We have, it's very fun.

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:42.720
 It's a very QI fish style, lots of interesting facts about food, but interspersed with genuinely

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:46.960
 useful cooking tips. Yeah. I mean, my level of cooking is so basic that any cooking tip is very

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:51.760
 useful to me, like put the toaster in that way and put the toaster. Pan the right way up. Yeah,

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:58.400
 exactly. But I think even better cooks will find it useful, but it's full of amazing facts. So do

00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:04.480
 listen, but today you've brought a fact for us, I believe, and you deliver it to us by means of a

00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:15.600
 riddle. So my question to you, why can't you make a banana violin? So many reasons. Are we talking?

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:22.240
 Okay. Firstly, unpack what a banana violin is. Yeah. So let's let's huddle here, guys. So violin

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:28.640
 is an instrument. Yeah. Is it a violin made out of banana or is it like a banana shaped violin?

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:32.160
 Do you think? Well, that's the thing. You've got a good shape where you could twang two bits of string

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:36.640
 on the side. In fact, you've got those bits of filament that run along the length of the banana.

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:40.320
 So you could just tie one of those at either end and ratchet it up a bit. And then actually,

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:44.800
 actually, turns out Jack, you can make a banana violin. You got no bow. It's because it doesn't

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:51.840
 come with a bow. A banana, a straighter banana. Yeah. Is this a violin made out of bananas?

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:59.520
 Well, I picked a violin not because of acoustic properties, but because it's made of wood. It's

00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:05.760
 made of wood. Yes. So what's strange about the banana tree? Bananas are not trees. They're not trees.

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:10.080
 They're herbs. They're herbs. Yeah. The biggest herbaceous plant in the world, in fact. It doesn't

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:17.120
 have lignin in its stem. So when you see a banana tree, its trunk is basically just folded up leaves.

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:22.720
 And in fact, I have sliced through one and then it's really like mushy and wet inside. There's no

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:26.480
 like... Well, you do that when you worked on that banana plantation before QI.

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:30.240
 Yeah. Well, you did slicing through a banana tree plant.

00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:34.880
 No, that was with my neighbour, actually. She was 76. So she doesn't, you know,

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:39.920
 trust herself with a saw. I don't know why she trusted me. She's got a banana in her garden.

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:42.800
 Yeah, surprisingly. You can use it from Jamaica, right?

00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:48.160
 No, hang on. I sure I've researched recently the giant, the Kiwi giant banana,

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:54.480
 by which I mean the New Zealand giant banana, which is very, very tall, but it only grows in valleys.

00:03:54.480 --> 00:04:00.480
 And that's because bananas are not woody, so they can't stand up to high winds.

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:06.080
 So only in a deep valley where there's no high wind can this giant banana thrive.

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:11.120
 Interesting. And I read that that's why the leaves get so tattered in the wind,

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:15.840
 because then get become less like sails and less able to blow the whole tree over.

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:21.760
 So sorry, you're saying an entire, the entire trunk of a banana tree is just, it's just all leaves.

00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:25.600
 Can you picture it? It doesn't look like a trunk. It's not like it's disguised itself.

00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:28.000
 It hasn't painted itself like a park. I'm picturing an oak.

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:33.040
 That's the kind of tree I'm picturing right now. No, it's a chunky, girthy...

00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:36.480
 But it does look like a tree. No, no, it's odd.

00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:40.800
 And if you asked like a four year old to draw a tree, it would look a little bit like a banana

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:43.280
 tree, right? Yeah. It's the same shape. Yeah.

00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:46.640
 Was it banana trees that Sean Locke once mentioned on QI, they move?

00:04:46.640 --> 00:04:51.520
 You said they walk? Yes, they walk. Is that because why they walk in Jack?

00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:56.880
 You've got a food podcast now? This is within your purview, not...

00:04:56.880 --> 00:04:58.480
 Not as easy as Alex, is it buddy?

00:04:58.480 --> 00:05:04.480
 I've heard this the case with the palm tree, which kind of has like the roots are above ground,

00:05:04.480 --> 00:05:10.480
 kind of like a crab, and then it will kill off one of the roots on one side and grow a

00:05:10.480 --> 00:05:14.000
 new root on the other side. So it can move about two meters a year. I don't know if that's the

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:19.280
 same thing. Wow. Have you ever seen, speaking of weird tree roots, I saw the other day a specific

00:05:19.280 --> 00:05:23.280
 tree, and I can't remember what it is, but it's one of the trees that grows in kind of swampy,

00:05:23.280 --> 00:05:29.680
 waterlogged areas, and its roots grow really oddly. So you'll see a tree and then around it,

00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:35.760
 it's like it's got 100 or 200 spikes, like big spikes, meter long spikes sticking up out of

00:05:35.760 --> 00:05:40.800
 the ground really pointed, and there it's roots, and its roots grow back up out of the earth,

00:05:40.800 --> 00:05:44.720
 like it's got this massive defensive wall all around it, and we just don't know why it does that.

00:05:44.720 --> 00:05:48.560
 We think it might be for stabilizing it, but... It's a tropical thing.

00:05:48.560 --> 00:05:52.800
 It's in like mangrove swamps. So yeah, tropical, sorry.

00:05:52.800 --> 00:05:59.920
 Is it cypress? No. Cypress the tree. Yeah, yeah. Cypress the country. No, no, Cypress the tree.

00:05:59.920 --> 00:06:04.960
 It's trees that grow in mangrove swampy type areas, they're quite waterlogged, but it looks so cool.

00:06:04.960 --> 00:06:09.520
 It's the catch on where he crawls. They've got a special name, because we were researching a body

00:06:09.520 --> 00:06:12.960
 part. I think there might be elbows. We were researching elbows recently, knees. They're called

00:06:12.960 --> 00:06:17.360
 knees. I've got it. We had to research knees. The tree's knees. And they're called the tree's knees.

00:06:17.360 --> 00:06:22.240
 Very good. So some trees have knees. Do they have nectar? Could you make honey from a tree's knees?

00:06:23.200 --> 00:06:26.480
 Do you see where I'm going? Yeah. I think no one's, no one's tried.

00:06:26.480 --> 00:06:29.440
 Okay. Oh, I thought you were saying that as another body part, as a neck.

00:06:29.440 --> 00:06:33.680
 Yeah. No, no. Bees, trees, knees. Bees, trees, knees. Oh, see. It's good.

00:06:33.680 --> 00:06:39.520
 This new show's gonna be good. More of these puns. It's all rhyming. Keep doing shows, isn't it?

00:06:39.520 --> 00:06:43.200
 Yeah, it's done in iambic pentameter, actually. They've got trunks, which is another body part.

00:06:43.200 --> 00:06:46.800
 I've got a trunk. Yes, you do. What's your trunk? We all do.

00:06:46.800 --> 00:06:51.200
 This is your trunk. You call the torso your trunk? Yeah. Don't you? We all do.

00:06:51.200 --> 00:06:55.280
 We, well, I'm one of the four people there. I don't know if it's my trunk.

00:06:55.280 --> 00:06:58.320
 It's a bit, it's a bit old fashioned, calling it your trunk.

00:06:58.320 --> 00:07:05.120
 Yes. Okay. You know, you might sort of salatiously refer to a woman from the 1920s as having some sort

00:07:05.120 --> 00:07:10.480
 of, what do you? Well, I don't know. Having a nice trunk. Isn't that just me? That's just you, pal.

00:07:10.480 --> 00:07:14.560
 Love your trunk. That's you and Charlie Chaplin. Yeah.

00:07:15.760 --> 00:07:21.440
 Trunk magazine. Speaking of, actually, just to get back to bananas. He famously said

00:07:21.440 --> 00:07:24.800
 the funniest thing to do is to have the banana skin on the floor,

00:07:24.800 --> 00:07:28.480
 and then they can carefully step over the banana skin and fall down a manhole.

00:07:28.480 --> 00:07:33.680
 Yeah, he told that to David Niven. It's in an autobiography by David Niven,

00:07:33.680 --> 00:07:39.360
 because someone, he overheard, sorry, it wasn't to David Niven. Niven overheard him

00:07:39.360 --> 00:07:44.400
 responding to a comedian who was saying, how do I make the most used gag in cinema

00:07:44.400 --> 00:07:49.120
 funny again? And Chaplin, at the top of his brilliant brain, said, yeah,

00:07:49.120 --> 00:07:53.920
 turns around, looks at it, goes, huh, relief, walks into a manhole.

00:07:53.920 --> 00:07:57.840
 We get, we get the comedy. You didn't need to go through the emotional role.

00:07:57.840 --> 00:07:59.280
 I do. That's where he acted it out.

00:07:59.280 --> 00:08:03.200
 When Jack's a hundred eps in, he'll know how to tell stories of it more dramatically.

00:08:03.200 --> 00:08:04.720
 I just, this is a mentoring.

00:08:04.720 --> 00:08:08.640
 I do feel it's amazing that you can mention anything to Dan, and Dan will say, yes,

00:08:08.640 --> 00:08:13.360
 David Niven once overheard Charlie Chaplin tell an anecdote about this,

00:08:13.360 --> 00:08:16.160
 and you'll have the book, and you'll know the page, you know, it's great.

00:08:16.160 --> 00:08:19.520
 But they have been a comedy trope for a long time. I think they first appeared in

00:08:19.520 --> 00:08:24.960
 vaudeville shows because they were, it was back when New York was getting,

00:08:24.960 --> 00:08:30.400
 you know, more and more populated, and they hadn't really sorted out how to get the bins

00:08:30.400 --> 00:08:34.560
 removed. So you'd find trash on the street, and so in the cartoons and the newspapers,

00:08:34.560 --> 00:08:40.000
 they would use the banana skin on the street to represent like Mucky New York, you know.

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:41.280
 So people thrown trash around.

00:08:41.280 --> 00:08:46.160
 I was reading about this just yesterday, about the New York situation, because New York has a

00:08:46.160 --> 00:08:50.960
 lot of rats, and it turns out it's just because they put their rubbish out in bags and not in bins.

00:08:50.960 --> 00:08:55.840
 And that's, and it all dates back to a bin strike by the city's bin men in 1968,

00:08:55.840 --> 00:08:59.840
 which is when they started just having to put their rubbish out in bags.

00:08:59.840 --> 00:09:00.880
 And then it became the norm.

00:09:00.880 --> 00:09:04.480
 And then it became the norm. And then, and recently they've been trying amazingly,

00:09:04.480 --> 00:09:09.760
 having actual bins, which they put out, and astonishingly, the rat population has declined.

00:09:09.760 --> 00:09:13.360
 And for years they've been trying, what if we make stronger poison for the rats?

00:09:13.360 --> 00:09:17.280
 And actually no, the answer is it's not to give the rats an all night banquet every night.

00:09:17.280 --> 00:09:24.320
 We have it in London in some places. We used to have that in our London house.

00:09:24.320 --> 00:09:24.800
 What?

00:09:24.800 --> 00:09:26.960
 What if we just put the bins out in bags.

00:09:26.960 --> 00:09:28.240
 Just put raw bags out on the street.

00:09:28.240 --> 00:09:29.120
 Raw bag, yeah.

00:09:29.120 --> 00:09:35.120
 Yeah, that's a bad idea, and you deserve to have rats, and you should have used bins.

00:09:35.120 --> 00:09:37.920
 Thank you, but I blame the council not myself.

00:09:37.920 --> 00:09:40.240
 It's actually usually the foxes who got there first.

00:09:40.240 --> 00:09:45.760
 But that, so the whole New York thing, then led to that becoming seen as you would slip on a banana.

00:09:45.760 --> 00:09:48.560
 And that would be funny when people saw it, Sean and Freud.

00:09:48.560 --> 00:09:51.840
 And then there was a guy, do you know Jack, the comedian who, I don't know his name,

00:09:51.840 --> 00:09:55.360
 but that was his act. He would go on stage and he would just slip on bananas.

00:09:55.360 --> 00:09:58.000
 Because it was just such like a new, great gag.

00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:01.840
 As a whole act, was this like a big Stuart Lee set piece, like an hour of just the same.

00:10:01.840 --> 00:10:04.160
 Filled up and up.

00:10:04.160 --> 00:10:07.120
 It was, it was back in the day where you would do a spot

00:10:07.120 --> 00:10:09.360
 on, so it's like, "Now please introduce."

00:10:09.360 --> 00:10:11.840
 And then you'd come out in a tux or whatever and slip on the banana.

00:10:11.840 --> 00:10:14.800
 And you'd do your five minutes and then you'd hair off to the other side of town.

00:10:14.800 --> 00:10:16.160
 Yeah, and it was a huge hit.

00:10:16.160 --> 00:10:16.480
 I bet.

00:10:16.480 --> 00:10:17.520
 There's a banana slipper.

00:10:17.520 --> 00:10:21.360
 And then they tested it on mythbusters.

00:10:21.360 --> 00:10:22.240
 Oh yeah, they did, yeah, yeah.

00:10:22.240 --> 00:10:23.600
 To see whether or not it truly is the...

00:10:23.600 --> 00:10:24.720
 They're actually slippery.

00:10:24.720 --> 00:10:26.000
 Yeah, if they are slippery or not.

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:28.480
 Because all slightly decayed vegetable matter will be slippery.

00:10:28.480 --> 00:10:28.960
 I think so.

00:10:28.960 --> 00:10:30.880
 You can slip on an aubergine, you can slip on a tomato.

00:10:30.880 --> 00:10:34.240
 But there's a thing about the inside of a banana, which makes it particularly

00:10:34.240 --> 00:10:36.480
 slippy, that little, well, I don't know.

00:10:36.480 --> 00:10:37.920
 I mean, Jack, you're...

00:10:37.920 --> 00:10:39.440
 You're the banana expert.

00:10:39.440 --> 00:10:42.080
 My guess would be that the reason it's famous for bananas is because you don't,

00:10:42.080 --> 00:10:43.360
 like an aubergine, you eat it all.

00:10:43.360 --> 00:10:43.920
 Yes, you do.

00:10:43.920 --> 00:10:45.840
 Or other vegetable you eat it all.

00:10:45.840 --> 00:10:49.120
 In the olden days, people didn't have as much food as you and I.

00:10:49.120 --> 00:10:50.240
 Why don't we feel bad?

00:10:50.240 --> 00:10:52.080
 Orange, the orange, the apple?

00:10:52.080 --> 00:10:53.440
 Orange peel, it should have been an orange.

00:10:53.440 --> 00:10:54.400
 Yeah, the apple.

00:10:54.400 --> 00:10:54.960
 Which bit of it?

00:10:54.960 --> 00:10:56.480
 Oh, you can slip on apple cores.

00:10:56.480 --> 00:10:57.200
 Yeah, apple.

00:10:57.200 --> 00:10:59.920
 You can't know, but it doesn't spread out as nicely and create such a good

00:10:59.920 --> 00:11:00.960
 skate for your foot.

00:11:00.960 --> 00:11:02.560
 I think it's just easy to draw.

00:11:02.560 --> 00:11:07.360
 Like, as a cartoonist, you would think, oh, I could draw an orange peel,

00:11:07.360 --> 00:11:08.320
 but a banana skate.

00:11:08.320 --> 00:11:09.200
 Oh, look, it's just funny.

00:11:09.200 --> 00:11:09.680
 Banana.

00:11:09.680 --> 00:11:09.920
 Exactly.

00:11:09.920 --> 00:11:10.880
 Say the word out loud.

00:11:10.880 --> 00:11:11.440
 Look at it.

00:11:11.440 --> 00:11:15.040
 How much of bananas' cultural clout is due to the name and the bright color?

00:11:15.040 --> 00:11:15.760
 Yeah, yeah.

00:11:15.760 --> 00:11:16.480
 And the shape.

00:11:16.480 --> 00:11:17.040
 And the shape.

00:11:17.040 --> 00:11:17.280
 And the shape.

00:11:17.280 --> 00:11:17.840
 And the shape.

00:11:17.840 --> 00:11:18.400
 It's very phallic.

00:11:18.400 --> 00:11:19.280
 It's brilliant.

00:11:19.280 --> 00:11:20.080
 Candle salad.

00:11:20.080 --> 00:11:22.720
 In fact, you'll hear about that in the podcast, and I won't spoil it.

00:11:22.720 --> 00:11:24.720
 Oh, I've seen a lot of salads.

00:11:24.720 --> 00:11:25.920
 He probably talks about it as well.

00:11:25.920 --> 00:11:26.560
 Oh, yeah.

00:11:26.560 --> 00:11:31.440
 Interestingly, the word banana is actually the only Walloff loan word I can find.

00:11:31.440 --> 00:11:32.960
 And Walloff being the language of Senegal.

00:11:32.960 --> 00:11:37.520
 There is a theory that dig as in, can you dig it?

00:11:37.520 --> 00:11:38.560
 You know, do you dig me?

00:11:38.560 --> 00:11:44.080
 It comes from a Walloff word, but not the, you know, the digging as in digging soil.

00:11:44.080 --> 00:11:45.280
 Dig it.

00:11:45.280 --> 00:11:46.080
 Oh, yeah, yeah.

00:11:46.080 --> 00:11:48.800
 Because it feels like can you dig it?

00:11:48.800 --> 00:11:50.480
 It just comes from digging.

00:11:50.480 --> 00:11:51.840
 Yeah, that doesn't make sense.

00:11:51.840 --> 00:11:56.000
 No, I can't think of any even long-winded way around why that would make sense.

00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:57.120
 Do you dig that?

00:11:57.120 --> 00:12:00.160
 There's a Walloff word dig out, which means to understand.

00:12:00.160 --> 00:12:05.200
 So they think it might have come via the American slave trade into the American South.

00:12:05.200 --> 00:12:05.520
 Right.

00:12:05.520 --> 00:12:06.320
 Okay, I buy it.

00:12:06.320 --> 00:12:08.720
 You sound very easily persuadable.

00:12:08.720 --> 00:12:09.360
 Oh, I'm in the market.

00:12:09.360 --> 00:12:10.320
 We're going to put up a fight.

00:12:10.320 --> 00:12:10.720
 No.

00:12:10.720 --> 00:12:13.840
 You're in the market for new slang to bring into your life.

00:12:13.840 --> 00:12:16.480
 Sorry, you can dig it.

00:12:16.480 --> 00:12:18.960
 New etymologies of slang is what I'm looking for.

00:12:18.960 --> 00:12:21.520
 That's cool.

00:12:21.520 --> 00:12:22.160
 That's very cool.

00:12:22.160 --> 00:12:22.880
 That's very cool.

00:12:22.880 --> 00:12:26.640
 Are they, is Senegal known globally for bananas, generally?

00:12:26.640 --> 00:12:30.080
 No, I think they originated in Southeast Asia.

00:12:30.320 --> 00:12:33.280
 Sort of the Philippines and what is now Malaysia.

00:12:33.280 --> 00:12:35.600
 But they did spread around the world quite quickly.

00:12:35.600 --> 00:12:36.560
 What is now Malaysia?

00:12:36.560 --> 00:12:37.760
 You can just call it Malaysia.

00:12:37.760 --> 00:12:41.200
 This is hundreds of years ago.

00:12:41.200 --> 00:12:41.920
 Yeah.

00:12:41.920 --> 00:12:42.880
 It's not what he calls it.

00:12:42.880 --> 00:12:47.200
 And of course, I went to what is now Zimbabwe language.

00:12:47.200 --> 00:12:48.240
 I love these eyes.

00:12:48.240 --> 00:12:52.560
 I suppose what was Pangea and it's now the Philippines.

00:12:52.560 --> 00:12:56.800
 What's your favorite banana fact then?

00:12:56.800 --> 00:12:59.680
 I, well, I mentioned them all in the podcast, in fact,

00:12:59.680 --> 00:13:01.760
 which you'll have to listen to all of the things I'm saying here,

00:13:01.760 --> 00:13:03.200
 none of the which I mentioned in the podcast.

00:13:03.200 --> 00:13:05.040
 Wait, so these are your least favorite banana facts.

00:13:05.040 --> 00:13:06.320
 Yeah, I think so.

00:13:06.320 --> 00:13:07.680
 But there's so many amazing things.

00:13:07.680 --> 00:13:10.880
 I've got way more facts, actually, about a cousin of the banana,

00:13:10.880 --> 00:13:12.400
 the pseudo-banana.

00:13:12.400 --> 00:13:13.840
 And it's known as the NSET.

00:13:13.840 --> 00:13:15.280
 I don't know if you've come across this.

00:13:15.280 --> 00:13:16.080
 I don't know.

00:13:16.080 --> 00:13:18.480
 A cousin of the bananas, like I say, it's a pseudo-banana.

00:13:18.480 --> 00:13:20.080
 It's native to Ethiopia.

00:13:20.080 --> 00:13:21.840
 And there are about 20 million people,

00:13:21.840 --> 00:13:24.480
 which is a fifth of the population of Ethiopia,

00:13:24.480 --> 00:13:26.320
 who rely on this as a staple crop.

00:13:27.760 --> 00:13:31.200
 But as I mentioned, the trunk is not made of lignin.

00:13:31.200 --> 00:13:32.720
 It's not wood, as we know it.

00:13:32.720 --> 00:13:33.840
 And they use the trunk.

00:13:33.840 --> 00:13:35.600
 In fact, the fruit is the only thing

00:13:35.600 --> 00:13:37.200
 that's inevitable about this tree.

00:13:37.200 --> 00:13:41.600
 And it's been described as the tree against hunger

00:13:41.600 --> 00:13:43.120
 because it grows so fast.

00:13:43.120 --> 00:13:47.360
 It grows so commonly and it grows all year round.

00:13:47.360 --> 00:13:48.320
 There's no season for it.

00:13:48.320 --> 00:13:50.400
 It propagates, so you don't need the seeds.

00:13:50.400 --> 00:13:52.480
 Yeah, they've been cooking it in Southwestern Ethiopia

00:13:52.480 --> 00:13:53.280
 for hundreds of years.

00:13:53.280 --> 00:13:57.920
 You basically chop the tree down, grind up the trunk,

00:13:57.920 --> 00:14:01.280
 and then leave it underground for up to two years to ferment.

00:14:01.280 --> 00:14:03.920
 And then you make bread out of the powder that comes out.

00:14:03.920 --> 00:14:06.480
 Wait, so does it grow bananas, which you eat normally?

00:14:06.480 --> 00:14:08.320
 No, you don't eat them because they're inevitable.

00:14:08.320 --> 00:14:09.200
 Right, I see.

00:14:09.200 --> 00:14:10.960
 So you only eat this bit of trunk.

00:14:10.960 --> 00:14:12.320
 Yeah, and the roots as well.

00:14:12.320 --> 00:14:15.360
 The roots create tubers of potatoes.

00:14:15.360 --> 00:14:16.720
 Everything but the fruit.

00:14:16.720 --> 00:14:17.840
 Everything but the banana.

00:14:17.840 --> 00:14:19.360
 Come on, that's a good name for something.

00:14:19.360 --> 00:14:20.400
 Everything but the banana.

00:14:20.400 --> 00:14:21.600
 That should be the name for your podcast.

00:14:21.600 --> 00:14:22.320
 Change it.

00:14:22.320 --> 00:14:24.160
 Still trying to think what this is.

00:14:24.160 --> 00:14:25.920
 Can you make any instrument out of bananas?

00:14:25.920 --> 00:14:27.280
 We're trying to think what what is.

00:14:27.280 --> 00:14:28.720
 You know he gave us the answer.

00:14:28.720 --> 00:14:29.360
 You're kidding.

00:14:29.360 --> 00:14:30.400
 The answer's already happened.

00:14:30.400 --> 00:14:31.200
 I'm so sorry.

00:14:31.200 --> 00:14:32.160
 Did it happen right at the top of the show?

00:14:32.160 --> 00:14:32.880
 Yeah, right at the top.

00:14:32.880 --> 00:14:33.680
 Yeah, it didn't take long.

00:14:33.680 --> 00:14:35.680
 I thought you were teasing us with a detail there.

00:14:35.680 --> 00:14:36.640
 No, I know.

00:14:36.640 --> 00:14:38.400
 I know he just slipped it on the razor.

00:14:38.400 --> 00:14:39.920
 We've just been going on this whole time.

00:14:39.920 --> 00:14:40.480
 Yeah.

00:14:40.480 --> 00:14:41.200
 No, I agree.

00:14:41.200 --> 00:14:41.920
 It's looking confusing.

00:14:41.920 --> 00:14:42.960
 We've sort of changed the format.

00:14:42.960 --> 00:14:44.400
 We did the whole format in the first 30 seconds.

00:14:44.400 --> 00:14:45.200
 You've already met me.

00:14:45.200 --> 00:14:46.400
 You know the idea, you know.

00:14:46.400 --> 00:14:47.760
 We've been rambling on.

00:14:47.760 --> 00:14:49.440
 Wait, so what was the answer again then?

00:14:49.440 --> 00:14:50.720
 Do you know what the question was?

00:14:50.720 --> 00:14:51.200
 Yeah.

00:14:51.200 --> 00:14:51.760
 What's the question?

00:14:51.760 --> 00:14:53.600
 Why can't you make a banana violin?

00:14:53.600 --> 00:14:55.200
 No, you know the answer, I think.

00:14:55.200 --> 00:14:56.240
 So do you know the answer?

00:14:56.240 --> 00:14:57.200
 No.

00:14:57.200 --> 00:14:58.080
 Well, Jack said it.

00:14:58.080 --> 00:14:59.440
 We've said it a few times.

00:14:59.440 --> 00:15:00.880
 What do violins made of?

00:15:00.880 --> 00:15:01.360
 Wood.

00:15:01.360 --> 00:15:02.320
 Well, that bit I got.

00:15:02.320 --> 00:15:02.720
 Right.

00:15:02.720 --> 00:15:04.400
 So what do bananas not make?

00:15:04.400 --> 00:15:05.040
 Yeah, they gave.

00:15:05.040 --> 00:15:05.600
 So you know the answer.

00:15:05.600 --> 00:15:07.680
 Oh, I thought that was just a clue along the way.

00:15:07.680 --> 00:15:09.040
 It's like being a primary school lesson.

00:15:09.040 --> 00:15:10.720
 At the end of the lesson, the teacher's like,

00:15:10.720 --> 00:15:12.320
 right, so two plus two is?

00:15:12.320 --> 00:15:12.960
 Have a banana.

00:15:12.960 --> 00:15:15.200
 No, because the format of this show

00:15:15.200 --> 00:15:16.640
 was we get clues along the way.

00:15:16.640 --> 00:15:18.880
 I didn't expect it to be so quickly.

00:15:18.880 --> 00:15:21.040
 I thought there was one more plot twist to it.

00:15:21.040 --> 00:15:22.640
 Yeah, well, you know, we know each other quite well.

00:15:22.640 --> 00:15:23.840
 It's still a good answer.

00:15:23.840 --> 00:15:24.640
 You're not knocking it.

00:15:24.640 --> 00:15:25.680
 I just thought it was a clue.

00:15:25.680 --> 00:15:28.080
 This is like David Foster Wallace novel way.

00:15:28.080 --> 00:15:30.160
 You get the novel, but then most of the book

00:15:30.160 --> 00:15:30.880
 is just footnotes.

00:15:30.880 --> 00:15:31.120
 Yeah, right.

00:15:31.120 --> 00:15:32.000
 And we've just been in the footnotes for so long.

00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:33.120
 So we're in the footnotes here.

00:15:33.120 --> 00:15:33.600
 Yeah.

00:15:33.600 --> 00:15:34.880
 Do you have a second question?

00:15:34.880 --> 00:15:39.280
 I feel like every else should have a second question

00:15:39.280 --> 00:15:41.280
 in case we want to be like Simon Cowell.

00:15:41.280 --> 00:15:42.160
 Or you just get it straight away.

00:15:42.160 --> 00:15:43.840
 Yeah, we're halfway through, we wave our hands.

00:15:43.840 --> 00:15:46.480
 Yeah, we have a second.

00:15:47.200 --> 00:15:48.960
 And then that's the one that really launches you

00:15:48.960 --> 00:15:51.360
 into the hearts of the UK.

00:15:51.360 --> 00:15:55.280
 So speaking of Ethiopia, it's a very unique place.

00:15:55.280 --> 00:15:59.840
 I think partly because it's pretty much 1,500 to 4,000

00:15:59.840 --> 00:16:00.880
 meters up.

00:16:00.880 --> 00:16:03.920
 So it's described as the roof of Africa sometimes.

00:16:03.920 --> 00:16:04.320
 OK.

00:16:04.320 --> 00:16:08.640
 Not as low at its point as 1,500.

00:16:08.640 --> 00:16:10.720
 Most of it is over 1,000 meters.

00:16:10.720 --> 00:16:12.960
 But there are bits that are almost sea level.

00:16:12.960 --> 00:16:13.840
 Cool.

00:16:13.840 --> 00:16:15.440
 It's Lesotho, the only country in the world,

00:16:15.440 --> 00:16:17.200
 with it's all above 1,000 meters.

00:16:17.200 --> 00:16:18.080
 Lesotho doesn't count it.

00:16:18.080 --> 00:16:19.200
 It's a dot on that.

00:16:19.200 --> 00:16:22.000
 Sorry, no offense.

00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:23.440
 And Lesotho listeners.

00:16:23.440 --> 00:16:28.800
 But yeah, Ethiopia is also, it wasn't colonized

00:16:28.800 --> 00:16:29.520
 by the Europeans.

00:16:29.520 --> 00:16:31.680
 And it's the only part of Africa I think there wasn't.

00:16:31.680 --> 00:16:35.200
 Which might have meant a lot of the traditions have survived.

00:16:35.200 --> 00:16:36.640
 But yeah, they eat--

00:16:36.640 --> 00:16:38.880
 I don't know if you've been to Ethiopian restaurants.

00:16:38.880 --> 00:16:40.640
 They often serve you injera bread.

00:16:40.640 --> 00:16:41.600
 Got to have injera.

00:16:41.600 --> 00:16:42.160
 It's elite.

00:16:42.160 --> 00:16:44.240
 It's like it's used as a plate.

00:16:44.240 --> 00:16:46.400
 So it's like a big pan cook.

00:16:46.400 --> 00:16:50.000
 And then they put all sort of curries and stews and meats on.

00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:53.360
 And then you just take bits off and scoop up the vegetables

00:16:53.360 --> 00:16:54.160
 and eat them.

00:16:54.160 --> 00:16:55.040
 Eat the plate as you go.

00:16:55.040 --> 00:16:56.320
 Yeah, with my favorite--

00:16:56.320 --> 00:16:58.320
 I reckon it was my favorite cuisine in London for about a year.

00:16:58.320 --> 00:16:59.600
 It's bloody delicious.

00:16:59.600 --> 00:17:01.280
 But then there's only one of it.

00:17:01.280 --> 00:17:03.200
 So once you had it every week for a year.

00:17:03.200 --> 00:17:04.880
 But it is very cool.

00:17:04.880 --> 00:17:06.880
 There's some huge percentage of the world who don't use--

00:17:06.880 --> 00:17:08.480
 they use their hands to eat everything.

00:17:08.480 --> 00:17:08.880
 Right.

00:17:08.880 --> 00:17:09.920
 I'm not sure where it came from.

00:17:09.920 --> 00:17:12.960
 There's a quote attributed to the Shah of Iran.

00:17:12.960 --> 00:17:15.600
 And he said, "Eating meals with cutlery

00:17:15.600 --> 00:17:18.080
 is like making love through an interpreter."

00:17:18.080 --> 00:17:19.280
 [LAUGHTER]

00:17:19.280 --> 00:17:20.320
 She's a bit pretentious.

00:17:20.320 --> 00:17:22.480
 Which I actually think could be a--

00:17:22.480 --> 00:17:24.640
 Add a frisson to the experience.

00:17:24.640 --> 00:17:26.000
 [LAUGHTER]

00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:26.880
 Ooh.

00:17:26.880 --> 00:17:28.000
 He says, ooh.

00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:31.360
 [LAUGHTER]

00:17:31.360 --> 00:17:34.640
 But yeah, so injera bread is made of teff,

00:17:34.640 --> 00:17:37.600
 which is a cereal that's not particularly well-known.

00:17:37.600 --> 00:17:38.800

00:17:38.800 --> 00:17:40.160
 It's a species of love grass.

00:17:40.160 --> 00:17:42.000
 Have you eaten all these?

00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:43.760
 I haven't eaten--

00:17:43.760 --> 00:17:48.480
 Koccho is the name of the bread you make from the end set.

00:17:48.480 --> 00:17:49.280
 I haven't eaten that.

00:17:49.280 --> 00:17:52.800
 I did hear a BBC radio for--

00:17:52.800 --> 00:17:53.680
 From my period.

00:17:53.680 --> 00:17:54.880
 Yeah, that's what I'm saying.

00:17:54.880 --> 00:17:55.280
 [INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:17:55.280 --> 00:17:57.040
 I heard a woman on BBC Radio 4.

00:17:57.040 --> 00:17:58.160
 He found a restaurant.

00:17:58.160 --> 00:18:01.280
 If I was setting up a food truck, I'd call it teff-steff.

00:18:01.280 --> 00:18:03.120
 [LAUGHTER]

00:18:03.120 --> 00:18:03.840
 Steff.

00:18:03.840 --> 00:18:06.160
 And I'd have to hire a woman called Stephanie to run it

00:18:06.160 --> 00:18:06.560
 day-to-day.

00:18:06.560 --> 00:18:07.600
 [LAUGHTER]

00:18:07.600 --> 00:18:08.240
 But I still--

00:18:08.240 --> 00:18:10.320
 Why wouldn't you call it "steff-steff"?

00:18:10.320 --> 00:18:10.880
 That's even better.

00:18:10.880 --> 00:18:11.840
 It's a "steff-teff."

00:18:11.840 --> 00:18:12.640
 You're on 10%.

00:18:12.640 --> 00:18:14.480
 [LAUGHTER]

00:18:14.480 --> 00:18:16.320
 Here's one for you all.

00:18:16.320 --> 00:18:23.120
 "Name a very posh middle-class North London grain."

00:18:23.120 --> 00:18:24.000
 Oh, um--

00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:26.160
 Are you shooting for someone like Quinoa?

00:18:26.160 --> 00:18:27.680
 Well, obviously, Quinoa originally

00:18:27.680 --> 00:18:29.920
 was eaten by a bunch of people at the moment, is?

00:18:29.920 --> 00:18:31.280
 Yes, that's not the point I'm making.

00:18:31.280 --> 00:18:32.560
 OK, sorry.

00:18:32.560 --> 00:18:33.920
 Sorry, I'm sorry.

00:18:33.920 --> 00:18:35.040
 Do you want more suggestions?

00:18:35.040 --> 00:18:35.840
 No, no, no, that's fine.

00:18:35.840 --> 00:18:37.520
 Anna's fallen into the bed.

00:18:37.520 --> 00:18:38.960
 She's currently impaled at the base of it.

00:18:38.960 --> 00:18:39.680
 I don't need any more.

00:18:39.680 --> 00:18:41.360
 She's impaled at the mangrove knee.

00:18:41.360 --> 00:18:43.840
 No more bodies on the bamboo, please.

00:18:43.840 --> 00:18:45.360
 It's not a grain.

00:18:45.360 --> 00:18:46.400
 Quinoa's not a grain.

00:18:46.400 --> 00:18:47.920
 Uday cereal.

00:18:47.920 --> 00:18:48.400
 Yeah.

00:18:48.400 --> 00:18:51.040
 Do you need more genetics for this series of QI?

00:18:51.040 --> 00:18:51.840
 It's not a grain.

00:18:51.840 --> 00:18:52.560
 It's not a grain.

00:18:52.560 --> 00:18:53.600
 I was like, what is it?

00:18:53.600 --> 00:18:54.560
 Niner's buckwheat.

00:18:54.560 --> 00:18:55.200
 I can't remember.

00:18:55.200 --> 00:18:58.880
 It's something like a sort of kind of edible fish or something.

00:18:58.880 --> 00:18:59.920
 I don't know.

00:18:59.920 --> 00:19:00.800
 It's just--

00:19:00.800 --> 00:19:03.360
 It's probably a flower or--

00:19:03.360 --> 00:19:04.960
 Well, it's like--

00:19:04.960 --> 00:19:06.560
 Redbush tea is actually a pea.

00:19:06.560 --> 00:19:08.720
 So you'd ask for a cup of pea if you're being accurate.

00:19:08.720 --> 00:19:09.520
 Nice.

00:19:09.520 --> 00:19:10.560
 But don't do that.

00:19:10.560 --> 00:19:13.520
 And going back to bananas, they're actually berries.

00:19:13.520 --> 00:19:14.800
 Herb is a berry.

00:19:14.800 --> 00:19:16.320
 I thought it was a herb.

00:19:16.320 --> 00:19:20.560
 Well, the tree is a herb, as in it's a herbaceous plant.

00:19:20.560 --> 00:19:24.320
 I think herb is a culinary term to describe small leaves

00:19:24.320 --> 00:19:26.880
 that you would add to the dishes to give them flavor.

00:19:26.880 --> 00:19:28.560
 And obviously, we don't do that with bananas.

00:19:28.560 --> 00:19:32.800
 But herbaceous plant is a botanist term

00:19:32.800 --> 00:19:35.120
 to describe something without a woody stem.

00:19:35.120 --> 00:19:38.320
 And yeah, technically, a banana is a berry.

00:19:38.320 --> 00:19:39.040
 Very nice.

00:19:39.040 --> 00:19:39.600
 Yeah.

00:19:39.600 --> 00:19:40.400
 Lovely stuff.

00:19:40.400 --> 00:19:42.640
 Can you make a violin out of quinoa?

00:19:42.640 --> 00:19:44.400
 These are-- so they're seeds.

00:19:44.400 --> 00:19:46.080
 Is that it?

00:19:46.080 --> 00:19:46.800
 What, quinoa?

00:19:46.800 --> 00:19:47.120
 Yeah.

00:19:47.120 --> 00:19:48.400
 I think that's what you're eating is a seed.

00:19:48.400 --> 00:19:49.360
 The seeds of the cereal.

00:19:49.360 --> 00:19:50.800
 Well, not a cereal, but a--

00:19:50.800 --> 00:19:51.120
 Yeah.

00:19:51.120 --> 00:19:52.960
 I really thought you were winging it when you said pseudo cereal.

00:19:52.960 --> 00:19:53.440
 No.

00:19:53.440 --> 00:19:54.160
 You just-- you just knew.

00:19:54.160 --> 00:19:54.960
 I thought that went up.

00:19:54.960 --> 00:19:55.760
 Buckwheat as well.

00:19:55.760 --> 00:19:56.800
 A buckwheat isn't wheat.

00:19:56.800 --> 00:19:57.760
 It's not even a cereal.

00:19:57.760 --> 00:19:59.120
 It's a pseudo cereal.

00:19:59.120 --> 00:20:00.720
 I love this-- I love this stuff.

00:20:00.720 --> 00:20:02.480
 It's what got me into QI in the first place.

00:20:02.480 --> 00:20:03.440
 All the pseudo stuff.

00:20:03.440 --> 00:20:04.160
 Minor correctness.

00:20:04.160 --> 00:20:05.360
 That's what it got down in as well.

00:20:05.360 --> 00:20:07.360
 But I think--

00:20:07.360 --> 00:20:08.960
 Quite a big gap between my pseudo and--

00:20:08.960 --> 00:20:09.460
 Udo.

00:20:09.460 --> 00:20:09.960
 Yeah.

00:20:09.960 --> 00:20:10.460
 Yeah.

00:20:10.460 --> 00:20:10.960
 That's it.

00:20:10.960 --> 00:20:12.640
 [INAUDIBLE]

00:20:12.640 --> 00:20:14.800
 Hey, so listen, we should wrap up in a second.

00:20:14.800 --> 00:20:17.520
 But Jack, before we go--

00:20:17.520 --> 00:20:19.760
 so I haven't actually heard the show yet.

00:20:19.760 --> 00:20:21.200
 So what episodes are going out?

00:20:21.200 --> 00:20:23.280
 And what can the listeners expect?

00:20:23.280 --> 00:20:27.960
 So on February the 24th, we'll launch garlic and banana.

00:20:27.960 --> 00:20:29.960
 And they'll be released at the same time.

00:20:29.960 --> 00:20:32.240
 Yeah, then we'll have weekly episodes from there.

00:20:32.240 --> 00:20:34.520
 Are you just talking about garlic the entire episode?

00:20:34.520 --> 00:20:35.120
 That's amazing.

00:20:35.120 --> 00:20:36.560
 That's pure QI, isn't it?

00:20:36.560 --> 00:20:37.400
 Yeah.

00:20:37.400 --> 00:20:39.520
 The premise is we all bring in our lunchboxes,

00:20:39.520 --> 00:20:42.320
 and they have something in them based around garlic.

00:20:42.320 --> 00:20:44.720
 And we don't know what they are until we open them.

00:20:44.720 --> 00:20:45.680
 And sometimes--

00:20:45.680 --> 00:20:47.760
 And often, Rosie's is something genuinely delicious,

00:20:47.760 --> 00:20:50.400
 and then they've brought some kind of weird scientific angle

00:20:50.400 --> 00:20:51.400
 that you wouldn't actually want to eat.

00:20:51.400 --> 00:20:52.440
 From the 1,500s, yeah.

00:20:52.440 --> 00:20:55.400
 Because Jack, when we were recording back in Covent Garden,

00:20:55.400 --> 00:20:57.760
 Jack would always be sitting just outside the recording

00:20:57.760 --> 00:20:58.840
 bit with the glass door.

00:20:58.840 --> 00:21:00.320
 And I'd go out and be like, how you doing?

00:21:00.320 --> 00:21:01.880
 And he's like, oh, I'm experimenting

00:21:01.880 --> 00:21:04.720
 with eating one of each of these things for the entire year.

00:21:04.720 --> 00:21:06.200
 What was that experiment that you were doing?

00:21:06.200 --> 00:21:10.400
 I did try and avoid-- because wheat, rice, and maize

00:21:10.400 --> 00:21:13.560
 constitute 50% of the global calories eaten.

00:21:13.560 --> 00:21:15.720
 So I tried to go a week without eating any of them.

00:21:15.720 --> 00:21:16.920
 That's probably what you're remembering.

00:21:16.920 --> 00:21:18.760
 So I was eating a lot of quinoa and tida cereals,

00:21:18.760 --> 00:21:19.260
 actually.

00:21:19.260 --> 00:21:20.920
 You were doing a lot of weird experiments.

00:21:20.920 --> 00:21:22.680
 So I just want to say to the listener,

00:21:22.680 --> 00:21:24.320
 this is the real deal here.

00:21:24.320 --> 00:21:25.560
 But yeah, we really love making it.

00:21:25.560 --> 00:21:28.920
 And we'll keep cooking things, even in our own spare time,

00:21:28.920 --> 00:21:30.200
 even if we turn the mics off.

00:21:30.200 --> 00:21:33.800
 But we'll be chatting food at the office and meeting up

00:21:33.800 --> 00:21:34.680
 with Rosie.

00:21:34.680 --> 00:21:36.760
 Listen to them, chat food, lunchbox,

00:21:36.760 --> 00:21:38.720

00:21:39.720 --> 00:21:40.120
 Do it.

00:21:40.120 --> 00:21:40.760
 Thanks, Jack.

00:21:40.760 --> 00:21:42.440
 And there's one all about bananas.

00:21:42.440 --> 00:21:43.920
 Yep, that's one of the first few.

00:21:43.920 --> 00:21:45.520
 But all those facts you just heard

00:21:45.520 --> 00:21:47.800
 with the rubbish banana facts and the good banana facts

00:21:47.800 --> 00:21:48.840
 are in that episode.

00:21:48.840 --> 00:21:50.840
 Thanks for bringing the shit ones to our show, Jack.

00:21:50.840 --> 00:21:51.840
 Appreciate it, Jack.

00:21:51.840 --> 00:21:55.840
 Sloppy Seconds is a good title for a food podcast.

00:21:55.840 --> 00:21:56.640
 OK.

00:21:56.640 --> 00:21:58.560
 All right, now on that note, let's wrap up.

00:21:58.560 --> 00:21:59.640
 We'll see you in a couple of weeks

00:21:59.640 --> 00:22:00.760
 for another bonus episode.
