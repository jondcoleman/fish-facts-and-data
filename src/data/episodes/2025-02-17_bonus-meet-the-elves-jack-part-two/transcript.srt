00:00:13,600 --> 00:00:21,200
 Hello and welcome to a very special bonus episode of Meet the Elf. This one with a twist because

3
00:00:21,200 --> 00:00:26,960
 you've already met him. Let's meet him again. This is Jack Chambers, who I'm sure you remember

4
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:31,120
 based on everything about him. We probably don't need to go back through your history at QI unless

5
00:00:31,120 --> 00:00:37,360
 you have any new exciting information to tell us about yourself. No, no, I don't think so. I'm

6
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:42,640
 another sort of year older and bit less hair on my head and my voice hasn't changed, so maybe you

7
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:50,000
 recognise it. Have you become a podcaster since we last spoke? Yeah, we've basically me and Manu,

8
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:55,120
 who's also been on Meet the Elf, and our good friend Rosie, who's a food expert. She's a stylist

9
00:00:55,120 --> 00:01:02,240
 and influencer and professional chef. We have created a podcast called Lunchbox Envy and it's

10
00:01:02,240 --> 00:01:08,000
 basically the QI approach to food, which is common to everyone. I think there are very few people

11
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:12,560
 except for those breatharians who don't eat food. Yeah, it's a clever subject to choose. Well done.

12
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:21,520
 This is not so much Meet the Elf as Reheat the Elf. Oh, yeah. Okay, I mean you actually had the

13
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:26,880
 word "meat" in the title there, but that's cool. That's not solely meat-based. An episode on garlic.

14
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:31,520
 That's true. That's the first one we're going to release on February the 24th. Right. You can

15
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:37,760
 find details at qi.com/lunchbox. And we've had a preview and it's great. We have, it's very fun.

16
00:01:37,760 --> 00:01:42,720
 It's a very QI fish style, lots of interesting facts about food, but interspersed with genuinely

17
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:46,960
 useful cooking tips. Yeah. I mean, my level of cooking is so basic that any cooking tip is very

18
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:51,760
 useful to me, like put the toaster in that way and put the toaster. Pan the right way up. Yeah,

19
00:01:51,760 --> 00:01:58,400
 exactly. But I think even better cooks will find it useful, but it's full of amazing facts. So do

20
00:01:58,400 --> 00:02:04,480
 listen, but today you've brought a fact for us, I believe, and you deliver it to us by means of a

21
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:15,600
 riddle. So my question to you, why can't you make a banana violin? So many reasons. Are we talking?

22
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:22,240
 Okay. Firstly, unpack what a banana violin is. Yeah. So let's let's huddle here, guys. So violin

23
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:28,640
 is an instrument. Yeah. Is it a violin made out of banana or is it like a banana shaped violin?

24
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:32,160
 Do you think? Well, that's the thing. You've got a good shape where you could twang two bits of string

25
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:36,640
 on the side. In fact, you've got those bits of filament that run along the length of the banana.

26
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:40,320
 So you could just tie one of those at either end and ratchet it up a bit. And then actually,

27
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:44,800
 actually, turns out Jack, you can make a banana violin. You got no bow. It's because it doesn't

28
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:51,840
 come with a bow. A banana, a straighter banana. Yeah. Is this a violin made out of bananas?

29
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:59,520
 Well, I picked a violin not because of acoustic properties, but because it's made of wood. It's

30
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:05,760
 made of wood. Yes. So what's strange about the banana tree? Bananas are not trees. They're not trees.

31
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:10,080
 They're herbs. They're herbs. Yeah. The biggest herbaceous plant in the world, in fact. It doesn't

32
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:17,120
 have lignin in its stem. So when you see a banana tree, its trunk is basically just folded up leaves.

33
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:22,720
 And in fact, I have sliced through one and then it's really like mushy and wet inside. There's no

34
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:26,480
 like... Well, you do that when you worked on that banana plantation before QI.

35
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:30,240
 Yeah. Well, you did slicing through a banana tree plant.

36
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:34,880
 No, that was with my neighbour, actually. She was 76. So she doesn't, you know,

37
00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:39,920
 trust herself with a saw. I don't know why she trusted me. She's got a banana in her garden.

38
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:42,800
 Yeah, surprisingly. You can use it from Jamaica, right?

39
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:48,160
 No, hang on. I sure I've researched recently the giant, the Kiwi giant banana,

40
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:54,480
 by which I mean the New Zealand giant banana, which is very, very tall, but it only grows in valleys.

41
00:03:54,480 --> 00:04:00,480
 And that's because bananas are not woody, so they can't stand up to high winds.

42
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:06,080
 So only in a deep valley where there's no high wind can this giant banana thrive.

43
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:11,120
 Interesting. And I read that that's why the leaves get so tattered in the wind,

44
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:15,840
 because then get become less like sails and less able to blow the whole tree over.

45
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:21,760
 So sorry, you're saying an entire, the entire trunk of a banana tree is just, it's just all leaves.

46
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:25,600
 Can you picture it? It doesn't look like a trunk. It's not like it's disguised itself.

47
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:28,000
 It hasn't painted itself like a park. I'm picturing an oak.

48
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:33,040
 That's the kind of tree I'm picturing right now. No, it's a chunky, girthy...

49
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:36,480
 But it does look like a tree. No, no, it's odd.

50
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:40,800
 And if you asked like a four year old to draw a tree, it would look a little bit like a banana

51
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:43,280
 tree, right? Yeah. It's the same shape. Yeah.

52
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:46,640
 Was it banana trees that Sean Locke once mentioned on QI, they move?

53
00:04:46,640 --> 00:04:51,520
 You said they walk? Yes, they walk. Is that because why they walk in Jack?

54
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:56,880
 You've got a food podcast now? This is within your purview, not...

55
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:58,480
 Not as easy as Alex, is it buddy?

56
00:04:58,480 --> 00:05:04,480
 I've heard this the case with the palm tree, which kind of has like the roots are above ground,

57
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:10,480
 kind of like a crab, and then it will kill off one of the roots on one side and grow a

58
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:14,000
 new root on the other side. So it can move about two meters a year. I don't know if that's the

59
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:19,280
 same thing. Wow. Have you ever seen, speaking of weird tree roots, I saw the other day a specific

60
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:23,280
 tree, and I can't remember what it is, but it's one of the trees that grows in kind of swampy,

61
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:29,680
 waterlogged areas, and its roots grow really oddly. So you'll see a tree and then around it,

62
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:35,760
 it's like it's got 100 or 200 spikes, like big spikes, meter long spikes sticking up out of

63
00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:40,800
 the ground really pointed, and there it's roots, and its roots grow back up out of the earth,

64
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:44,720
 like it's got this massive defensive wall all around it, and we just don't know why it does that.

65
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:48,560
 We think it might be for stabilizing it, but... It's a tropical thing.

66
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:52,800
 It's in like mangrove swamps. So yeah, tropical, sorry.

67
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:59,920
 Is it cypress? No. Cypress the tree. Yeah, yeah. Cypress the country. No, no, Cypress the tree.

68
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:04,960
 It's trees that grow in mangrove swampy type areas, they're quite waterlogged, but it looks so cool.

69
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:09,520
 It's the catch on where he crawls. They've got a special name, because we were researching a body

70
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:12,960
 part. I think there might be elbows. We were researching elbows recently, knees. They're called

71
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:17,360
 knees. I've got it. We had to research knees. The tree's knees. And they're called the tree's knees.

72
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:22,240
 Very good. So some trees have knees. Do they have nectar? Could you make honey from a tree's knees?

73
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:26,480
 Do you see where I'm going? Yeah. I think no one's, no one's tried.

74
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:29,440
 Okay. Oh, I thought you were saying that as another body part, as a neck.

75
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:33,680
 Yeah. No, no. Bees, trees, knees. Bees, trees, knees. Oh, see. It's good.

76
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:39,520
 This new show's gonna be good. More of these puns. It's all rhyming. Keep doing shows, isn't it?

77
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:43,200
 Yeah, it's done in iambic pentameter, actually. They've got trunks, which is another body part.

78
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:46,800
 I've got a trunk. Yes, you do. What's your trunk? We all do.

79
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:51,200
 This is your trunk. You call the torso your trunk? Yeah. Don't you? We all do.

80
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:55,280
 We, well, I'm one of the four people there. I don't know if it's my trunk.

81
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:58,320
 It's a bit, it's a bit old fashioned, calling it your trunk.

82
00:06:58,320 --> 00:07:05,120
 Yes. Okay. You know, you might sort of salatiously refer to a woman from the 1920s as having some sort

83
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:10,480
 of, what do you? Well, I don't know. Having a nice trunk. Isn't that just me? That's just you, pal.

84
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:14,560
 Love your trunk. That's you and Charlie Chaplin. Yeah.

85
00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:21,440
 Trunk magazine. Speaking of, actually, just to get back to bananas. He famously said

86
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:24,800
 the funniest thing to do is to have the banana skin on the floor,

87
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:28,480
 and then they can carefully step over the banana skin and fall down a manhole.

88
00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:33,680
 Yeah, he told that to David Niven. It's in an autobiography by David Niven,

89
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:39,360
 because someone, he overheard, sorry, it wasn't to David Niven. Niven overheard him

90
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:44,400
 responding to a comedian who was saying, how do I make the most used gag in cinema

91
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:49,120
 funny again? And Chaplin, at the top of his brilliant brain, said, yeah,

92
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:53,920
 turns around, looks at it, goes, huh, relief, walks into a manhole.

93
00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:57,840
 We get, we get the comedy. You didn't need to go through the emotional role.

94
00:07:57,840 --> 00:07:59,280
 I do. That's where he acted it out.

95
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:03,200
 When Jack's a hundred eps in, he'll know how to tell stories of it more dramatically.

96
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:04,720
 I just, this is a mentoring.

97
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:08,640
 I do feel it's amazing that you can mention anything to Dan, and Dan will say, yes,

98
00:08:08,640 --> 00:08:13,360
 David Niven once overheard Charlie Chaplin tell an anecdote about this,

99
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:16,160
 and you'll have the book, and you'll know the page, you know, it's great.

100
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:19,520
 But they have been a comedy trope for a long time. I think they first appeared in

101
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:24,960
 vaudeville shows because they were, it was back when New York was getting,

102
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:30,400
 you know, more and more populated, and they hadn't really sorted out how to get the bins

103
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:34,560
 removed. So you'd find trash on the street, and so in the cartoons and the newspapers,

104
00:08:34,560 --> 00:08:40,000
 they would use the banana skin on the street to represent like Mucky New York, you know.

105
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,280
 So people thrown trash around.

106
00:08:41,280 --> 00:08:46,160
 I was reading about this just yesterday, about the New York situation, because New York has a

107
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:50,960
 lot of rats, and it turns out it's just because they put their rubbish out in bags and not in bins.

108
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:55,840
 And that's, and it all dates back to a bin strike by the city's bin men in 1968,

109
00:08:55,840 --> 00:08:59,840
 which is when they started just having to put their rubbish out in bags.

110
00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:00,880
 And then it became the norm.

111
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:04,480
 And then it became the norm. And then, and recently they've been trying amazingly,

112
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:09,760
 having actual bins, which they put out, and astonishingly, the rat population has declined.

113
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:13,360
 And for years they've been trying, what if we make stronger poison for the rats?

114
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:17,280
 And actually no, the answer is it's not to give the rats an all night banquet every night.

115
00:09:17,280 --> 00:09:24,320
 We have it in London in some places. We used to have that in our London house.

116
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:24,800
 What?

117
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:26,960
 What if we just put the bins out in bags.

118
00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:28,240
 Just put raw bags out on the street.

119
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:29,120
 Raw bag, yeah.

120
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:35,120
 Yeah, that's a bad idea, and you deserve to have rats, and you should have used bins.

121
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:37,920
 Thank you, but I blame the council not myself.

122
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:40,240
 It's actually usually the foxes who got there first.

123
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:45,760
 But that, so the whole New York thing, then led to that becoming seen as you would slip on a banana.

124
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:48,560
 And that would be funny when people saw it, Sean and Freud.

125
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:51,840
 And then there was a guy, do you know Jack, the comedian who, I don't know his name,

126
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:55,360
 but that was his act. He would go on stage and he would just slip on bananas.

127
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:58,000
 Because it was just such like a new, great gag.

128
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:01,840
 As a whole act, was this like a big Stuart Lee set piece, like an hour of just the same.

129
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:04,160
 Filled up and up.

130
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:07,120
 It was, it was back in the day where you would do a spot

131
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:09,360
 on, so it's like, "Now please introduce."

132
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:11,840
 And then you'd come out in a tux or whatever and slip on the banana.

133
00:10:11,840 --> 00:10:14,800
 And you'd do your five minutes and then you'd hair off to the other side of town.

134
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:16,160
 Yeah, and it was a huge hit.

135
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:16,480
 I bet.

136
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:17,520
 There's a banana slipper.

137
00:10:17,520 --> 00:10:21,360
 And then they tested it on mythbusters.

138
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:22,240
 Oh yeah, they did, yeah, yeah.

139
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:23,600
 To see whether or not it truly is the...

140
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:24,720
 They're actually slippery.

141
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:26,000
 Yeah, if they are slippery or not.

142
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,480
 Because all slightly decayed vegetable matter will be slippery.

143
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:28,960
 I think so.

144
00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:30,880
 You can slip on an aubergine, you can slip on a tomato.

145
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:34,240
 But there's a thing about the inside of a banana, which makes it particularly

146
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:36,480
 slippy, that little, well, I don't know.

147
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:37,920
 I mean, Jack, you're...

148
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:39,440
 You're the banana expert.

149
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:42,080
 My guess would be that the reason it's famous for bananas is because you don't,

150
00:10:42,080 --> 00:10:43,360
 like an aubergine, you eat it all.

151
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:43,920
 Yes, you do.

152
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:45,840
 Or other vegetable you eat it all.

153
00:10:45,840 --> 00:10:49,120
 In the olden days, people didn't have as much food as you and I.

154
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:50,240
 Why don't we feel bad?

155
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:52,080
 Orange, the orange, the apple?

156
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:53,440
 Orange peel, it should have been an orange.

157
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:54,400
 Yeah, the apple.

158
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:54,960
 Which bit of it?

159
00:10:54,960 --> 00:10:56,480
 Oh, you can slip on apple cores.

160
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:57,200
 Yeah, apple.

161
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:59,920
 You can't know, but it doesn't spread out as nicely and create such a good

162
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:00,960
 skate for your foot.

163
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:02,560
 I think it's just easy to draw.

164
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:07,360
 Like, as a cartoonist, you would think, oh, I could draw an orange peel,

165
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:08,320
 but a banana skate.

166
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:09,200
 Oh, look, it's just funny.

167
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:09,680
 Banana.

168
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:09,920
 Exactly.

169
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:10,880
 Say the word out loud.

170
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:11,440
 Look at it.

171
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:15,040
 How much of bananas' cultural clout is due to the name and the bright color?

172
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:15,760
 Yeah, yeah.

173
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:16,480
 And the shape.

174
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:17,040
 And the shape.

175
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:17,280
 And the shape.

176
00:11:17,280 --> 00:11:17,840
 And the shape.

177
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:18,400
 It's very phallic.

178
00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:19,280
 It's brilliant.

179
00:11:19,280 --> 00:11:20,080
 Candle salad.

180
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:22,720
 In fact, you'll hear about that in the podcast, and I won't spoil it.

181
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:24,720
 Oh, I've seen a lot of salads.

182
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:25,920
 He probably talks about it as well.

183
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:26,560
 Oh, yeah.

184
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:31,440
 Interestingly, the word banana is actually the only Walloff loan word I can find.

185
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:32,960
 And Walloff being the language of Senegal.

186
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:37,520
 There is a theory that dig as in, can you dig it?

187
00:11:37,520 --> 00:11:38,560
 You know, do you dig me?

188
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:44,080
 It comes from a Walloff word, but not the, you know, the digging as in digging soil.

189
00:11:44,080 --> 00:11:45,280
 Dig it.

190
00:11:45,280 --> 00:11:46,080
 Oh, yeah, yeah.

191
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:48,800
 Because it feels like can you dig it?

192
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:50,480
 It just comes from digging.

193
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:51,840
 Yeah, that doesn't make sense.

194
00:11:51,840 --> 00:11:56,000
 No, I can't think of any even long-winded way around why that would make sense.

195
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,120
 Do you dig that?

196
00:11:57,120 --> 00:12:00,160
 There's a Walloff word dig out, which means to understand.

197
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:05,200
 So they think it might have come via the American slave trade into the American South.

198
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:05,520
 Right.

199
00:12:05,520 --> 00:12:06,320
 Okay, I buy it.

200
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:08,720
 You sound very easily persuadable.

201
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:09,360
 Oh, I'm in the market.

202
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:10,320
 We're going to put up a fight.

203
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:10,720
 No.

204
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:13,840
 You're in the market for new slang to bring into your life.

205
00:12:13,840 --> 00:12:16,480
 Sorry, you can dig it.

206
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:18,960
 New etymologies of slang is what I'm looking for.

207
00:12:18,960 --> 00:12:21,520
 That's cool.

208
00:12:21,520 --> 00:12:22,160
 That's very cool.

209
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:22,880
 That's very cool.

210
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:26,640
 Are they, is Senegal known globally for bananas, generally?

211
00:12:26,640 --> 00:12:30,080
 No, I think they originated in Southeast Asia.

212
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:33,280
 Sort of the Philippines and what is now Malaysia.

213
00:12:33,280 --> 00:12:35,600
 But they did spread around the world quite quickly.

214
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:36,560
 What is now Malaysia?

215
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:37,760
 You can just call it Malaysia.

216
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:41,200
 This is hundreds of years ago.

217
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:41,920
 Yeah.

218
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:42,880
 It's not what he calls it.

219
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:47,200
 And of course, I went to what is now Zimbabwe language.

220
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:48,240
 I love these eyes.

221
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:52,560
 I suppose what was Pangea and it's now the Philippines.

222
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:56,800
 What's your favorite banana fact then?

223
00:12:56,800 --> 00:12:59,680
 I, well, I mentioned them all in the podcast, in fact,

224
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:01,760
 which you'll have to listen to all of the things I'm saying here,

225
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:03,200
 none of the which I mentioned in the podcast.

226
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:05,040
 Wait, so these are your least favorite banana facts.

227
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:06,320
 Yeah, I think so.

228
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:07,680
 But there's so many amazing things.

229
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:10,880
 I've got way more facts, actually, about a cousin of the banana,

230
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:12,400
 the pseudo-banana.

231
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:13,840
 And it's known as the NSET.

232
00:13:13,840 --> 00:13:15,280
 I don't know if you've come across this.

233
00:13:15,280 --> 00:13:16,080
 I don't know.

234
00:13:16,080 --> 00:13:18,480
 A cousin of the bananas, like I say, it's a pseudo-banana.

235
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:20,080
 It's native to Ethiopia.

236
00:13:20,080 --> 00:13:21,840
 And there are about 20 million people,

237
00:13:21,840 --> 00:13:24,480
 which is a fifth of the population of Ethiopia,

238
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:26,320
 who rely on this as a staple crop.

239
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:31,200
 But as I mentioned, the trunk is not made of lignin.

240
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:32,720
 It's not wood, as we know it.

241
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:33,840
 And they use the trunk.

242
00:13:33,840 --> 00:13:35,600
 In fact, the fruit is the only thing

243
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:37,200
 that's inevitable about this tree.

244
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:41,600
 And it's been described as the tree against hunger

245
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:43,120
 because it grows so fast.

246
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:47,360
 It grows so commonly and it grows all year round.

247
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:48,320
 There's no season for it.

248
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:50,400
 It propagates, so you don't need the seeds.

249
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:52,480
 Yeah, they've been cooking it in Southwestern Ethiopia

250
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:53,280
 for hundreds of years.

251
00:13:53,280 --> 00:13:57,920
 You basically chop the tree down, grind up the trunk,

252
00:13:57,920 --> 00:14:01,280
 and then leave it underground for up to two years to ferment.

253
00:14:01,280 --> 00:14:03,920
 And then you make bread out of the powder that comes out.

254
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:06,480
 Wait, so does it grow bananas, which you eat normally?

255
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:08,320
 No, you don't eat them because they're inevitable.

256
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:09,200
 Right, I see.

257
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:10,960
 So you only eat this bit of trunk.

258
00:14:10,960 --> 00:14:12,320
 Yeah, and the roots as well.

259
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:15,360
 The roots create tubers of potatoes.

260
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:16,720
 Everything but the fruit.

261
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:17,840
 Everything but the banana.

262
00:14:17,840 --> 00:14:19,360
 Come on, that's a good name for something.

263
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:20,400
 Everything but the banana.

264
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:21,600
 That should be the name for your podcast.

265
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:22,320
 Change it.

266
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:24,160
 Still trying to think what this is.

267
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:25,920
 Can you make any instrument out of bananas?

268
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:27,280
 We're trying to think what what is.

269
00:14:27,280 --> 00:14:28,720
 You know he gave us the answer.

270
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:29,360
 You're kidding.

271
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:30,400
 The answer's already happened.

272
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:31,200
 I'm so sorry.

273
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:32,160
 Did it happen right at the top of the show?

274
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:32,880
 Yeah, right at the top.

275
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:33,680
 Yeah, it didn't take long.

276
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:35,680
 I thought you were teasing us with a detail there.

277
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:36,640
 No, I know.

278
00:14:36,640 --> 00:14:38,400
 I know he just slipped it on the razor.

279
00:14:38,400 --> 00:14:39,920
 We've just been going on this whole time.

280
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:40,480
 Yeah.

281
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:41,200
 No, I agree.

282
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:41,920
 It's looking confusing.

283
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:42,960
 We've sort of changed the format.

284
00:14:42,960 --> 00:14:44,400
 We did the whole format in the first 30 seconds.

285
00:14:44,400 --> 00:14:45,200
 You've already met me.

286
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:46,400
 You know the idea, you know.

287
00:14:46,400 --> 00:14:47,760
 We've been rambling on.

288
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:49,440
 Wait, so what was the answer again then?

289
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:50,720
 Do you know what the question was?

290
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:51,200
 Yeah.

291
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:51,760
 What's the question?

292
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:53,600
 Why can't you make a banana violin?

293
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:55,200
 No, you know the answer, I think.

294
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:56,240
 So do you know the answer?

295
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:57,200
 No.

296
00:14:57,200 --> 00:14:58,080
 Well, Jack said it.

297
00:14:58,080 --> 00:14:59,440
 We've said it a few times.

298
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:00,880
 What do violins made of?

299
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:01,360
 Wood.

300
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:02,320
 Well, that bit I got.

301
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:02,720
 Right.

302
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:04,400
 So what do bananas not make?

303
00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:05,040
 Yeah, they gave.

304
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:05,600
 So you know the answer.

305
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:07,680
 Oh, I thought that was just a clue along the way.

306
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:09,040
 It's like being a primary school lesson.

307
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:10,720
 At the end of the lesson, the teacher's like,

308
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:12,320
 right, so two plus two is?

309
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:12,960
 Have a banana.

310
00:15:12,960 --> 00:15:15,200
 No, because the format of this show

311
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:16,640
 was we get clues along the way.

312
00:15:16,640 --> 00:15:18,880
 I didn't expect it to be so quickly.

313
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:21,040
 I thought there was one more plot twist to it.

314
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:22,640
 Yeah, well, you know, we know each other quite well.

315
00:15:22,640 --> 00:15:23,840
 It's still a good answer.

316
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:24,640
 You're not knocking it.

317
00:15:24,640 --> 00:15:25,680
 I just thought it was a clue.

318
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:28,080
 This is like David Foster Wallace novel way.

319
00:15:28,080 --> 00:15:30,160
 You get the novel, but then most of the book

320
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:30,880
 is just footnotes.

321
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:31,120
 Yeah, right.

322
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:32,000
 And we've just been in the footnotes for so long.

323
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,120
 So we're in the footnotes here.

324
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:33,600
 Yeah.

325
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:34,880
 Do you have a second question?

326
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:39,280
 I feel like every else should have a second question

327
00:15:39,280 --> 00:15:41,280
 in case we want to be like Simon Cowell.

328
00:15:41,280 --> 00:15:42,160
 Or you just get it straight away.

329
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:43,840
 Yeah, we're halfway through, we wave our hands.

330
00:15:43,840 --> 00:15:46,480
 Yeah, we have a second.

331
00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:48,960
 And then that's the one that really launches you

332
00:15:48,960 --> 00:15:51,360
 into the hearts of the UK.

333
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:55,280
 So speaking of Ethiopia, it's a very unique place.

334
00:15:55,280 --> 00:15:59,840
 I think partly because it's pretty much 1,500 to 4,000

335
00:15:59,840 --> 00:16:00,880
 meters up.

336
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:03,920
 So it's described as the roof of Africa sometimes.

337
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:04,320
 OK.

338
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:08,640
 Not as low at its point as 1,500.

339
00:16:08,640 --> 00:16:10,720
 Most of it is over 1,000 meters.

340
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:12,960
 But there are bits that are almost sea level.

341
00:16:12,960 --> 00:16:13,840
 Cool.

342
00:16:13,840 --> 00:16:15,440
 It's Lesotho, the only country in the world,

343
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:17,200
 with it's all above 1,000 meters.

344
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:18,080
 Lesotho doesn't count it.

345
00:16:18,080 --> 00:16:19,200
 It's a dot on that.

346
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:22,000
 Sorry, no offense.

347
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,440
 And Lesotho listeners.

348
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:28,800
 But yeah, Ethiopia is also, it wasn't colonized

349
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:29,520
 by the Europeans.

350
00:16:29,520 --> 00:16:31,680
 And it's the only part of Africa I think there wasn't.

351
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:35,200
 Which might have meant a lot of the traditions have survived.

352
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:36,640
 But yeah, they eat--

353
00:16:36,640 --> 00:16:38,880
 I don't know if you've been to Ethiopian restaurants.

354
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:40,640
 They often serve you injera bread.

355
00:16:40,640 --> 00:16:41,600
 Got to have injera.

356
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:42,160
 It's elite.

357
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:44,240
 It's like it's used as a plate.

358
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:46,400
 So it's like a big pan cook.

359
00:16:46,400 --> 00:16:50,000
 And then they put all sort of curries and stews and meats on.

360
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:53,360
 And then you just take bits off and scoop up the vegetables

361
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:54,160
 and eat them.

362
00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:55,040
 Eat the plate as you go.

363
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:56,320
 Yeah, with my favorite--

364
00:16:56,320 --> 00:16:58,320
 I reckon it was my favorite cuisine in London for about a year.

365
00:16:58,320 --> 00:16:59,600
 It's bloody delicious.

366
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:01,280
 But then there's only one of it.

367
00:17:01,280 --> 00:17:03,200
 So once you had it every week for a year.

368
00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:04,880
 But it is very cool.

369
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:06,880
 There's some huge percentage of the world who don't use--

370
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:08,480
 they use their hands to eat everything.

371
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:08,880
 Right.

372
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:09,920
 I'm not sure where it came from.

373
00:17:09,920 --> 00:17:12,960
 There's a quote attributed to the Shah of Iran.

374
00:17:12,960 --> 00:17:15,600
 And he said, "Eating meals with cutlery

375
00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:18,080
 is like making love through an interpreter."

376
00:17:18,080 --> 00:17:19,280
 [LAUGHTER]

377
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:20,320
 She's a bit pretentious.

378
00:17:20,320 --> 00:17:22,480
 Which I actually think could be a--

379
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:24,640
 Add a frisson to the experience.

380
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:26,000
 [LAUGHTER]

381
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:26,880
 Ooh.

382
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:28,000
 He says, ooh.

383
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:31,360
 [LAUGHTER]

384
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:34,640
 But yeah, so injera bread is made of teff,

385
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:37,600
 which is a cereal that's not particularly well-known.

386
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:38,800
 T-E-Double-F.

387
00:17:38,800 --> 00:17:40,160
 It's a species of love grass.

388
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:42,000
 Have you eaten all these?

389
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:43,760
 I haven't eaten--

390
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:48,480
 Koccho is the name of the bread you make from the end set.

391
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:49,280
 I haven't eaten that.

392
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:52,800
 I did hear a BBC radio for--

393
00:17:52,800 --> 00:17:53,680
 From my period.

394
00:17:53,680 --> 00:17:54,880
 Yeah, that's what I'm saying.

395
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:55,280
 [INTERPOSING VOICES]

396
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:57,040
 I heard a woman on BBC Radio 4.

397
00:17:57,040 --> 00:17:58,160
 He found a restaurant.

398
00:17:58,160 --> 00:18:01,280
 If I was setting up a food truck, I'd call it teff-steff.

399
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:03,120
 [LAUGHTER]

400
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:03,840
 Steff.

401
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:06,160
 And I'd have to hire a woman called Stephanie to run it

402
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:06,560
 day-to-day.

403
00:18:06,560 --> 00:18:07,600
 [LAUGHTER]

404
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:08,240
 But I still--

405
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:10,320
 Why wouldn't you call it "steff-steff"?

406
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:10,880
 That's even better.

407
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:11,840
 It's a "steff-teff."

408
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:12,640
 You're on 10%.

409
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:14,480
 [LAUGHTER]

410
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:16,320
 Here's one for you all.

411
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:23,120
 "Name a very posh middle-class North London grain."

412
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:24,000
 Oh, um--

413
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,160
 Are you shooting for someone like Quinoa?

414
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:27,680
 Well, obviously, Quinoa originally

415
00:18:27,680 --> 00:18:29,920
 was eaten by a bunch of people at the moment, is?

416
00:18:29,920 --> 00:18:31,280
 Yes, that's not the point I'm making.

417
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:32,560
 OK, sorry.

418
00:18:32,560 --> 00:18:33,920
 Sorry, I'm sorry.

419
00:18:33,920 --> 00:18:35,040
 Do you want more suggestions?

420
00:18:35,040 --> 00:18:35,840
 No, no, no, that's fine.

421
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:37,520
 Anna's fallen into the bed.

422
00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:38,960
 She's currently impaled at the base of it.

423
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:39,680
 I don't need any more.

424
00:18:39,680 --> 00:18:41,360
 She's impaled at the mangrove knee.

425
00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:43,840
 No more bodies on the bamboo, please.

426
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:45,360
 It's not a grain.

427
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:46,400
 Quinoa's not a grain.

428
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:47,920
 Uday cereal.

429
00:18:47,920 --> 00:18:48,400
 Yeah.

430
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:51,040
 Do you need more genetics for this series of QI?

431
00:18:51,040 --> 00:18:51,840
 It's not a grain.

432
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:52,560
 It's not a grain.

433
00:18:52,560 --> 00:18:53,600
 I was like, what is it?

434
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:54,560
 Niner's buckwheat.

435
00:18:54,560 --> 00:18:55,200
 I can't remember.

436
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:58,880
 It's something like a sort of kind of edible fish or something.

437
00:18:58,880 --> 00:18:59,920
 I don't know.

438
00:18:59,920 --> 00:19:00,800
 It's just--

439
00:19:00,800 --> 00:19:03,360
 It's probably a flower or--

440
00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:04,960
 Well, it's like--

441
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:06,560
 Redbush tea is actually a pea.

442
00:19:06,560 --> 00:19:08,720
 So you'd ask for a cup of pea if you're being accurate.

443
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:09,520
 Nice.

444
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:10,560
 But don't do that.

445
00:19:10,560 --> 00:19:13,520
 And going back to bananas, they're actually berries.

446
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:14,800
 Herb is a berry.

447
00:19:14,800 --> 00:19:16,320
 I thought it was a herb.

448
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:20,560
 Well, the tree is a herb, as in it's a herbaceous plant.

449
00:19:20,560 --> 00:19:24,320
 I think herb is a culinary term to describe small leaves

450
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:26,880
 that you would add to the dishes to give them flavor.

451
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:28,560
 And obviously, we don't do that with bananas.

452
00:19:28,560 --> 00:19:32,800
 But herbaceous plant is a botanist term

453
00:19:32,800 --> 00:19:35,120
 to describe something without a woody stem.

454
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:38,320
 And yeah, technically, a banana is a berry.

455
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:39,040
 Very nice.

456
00:19:39,040 --> 00:19:39,600
 Yeah.

457
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:40,400
 Lovely stuff.

458
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:42,640
 Can you make a violin out of quinoa?

459
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:44,400
 These are-- so they're seeds.

460
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:46,080
 Is that it?

461
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:46,800
 What, quinoa?

462
00:19:46,800 --> 00:19:47,120
 Yeah.

463
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:48,400
 I think that's what you're eating is a seed.

464
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:49,360
 The seeds of the cereal.

465
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:50,800
 Well, not a cereal, but a--

466
00:19:50,800 --> 00:19:51,120
 Yeah.

467
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:52,960
 I really thought you were winging it when you said pseudo cereal.

468
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:53,440
 No.

469
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:54,160
 You just-- you just knew.

470
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:54,960
 I thought that went up.

471
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:55,760
 Buckwheat as well.

472
00:19:55,760 --> 00:19:56,800
 A buckwheat isn't wheat.

473
00:19:56,800 --> 00:19:57,760
 It's not even a cereal.

474
00:19:57,760 --> 00:19:59,120
 It's a pseudo cereal.

475
00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:00,720
 I love this-- I love this stuff.

476
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:02,480
 It's what got me into QI in the first place.

477
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:03,440
 All the pseudo stuff.

478
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:04,160
 Minor correctness.

479
00:20:04,160 --> 00:20:05,360
 That's what it got down in as well.

480
00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:07,360
 But I think--

481
00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:08,960
 Quite a big gap between my pseudo and--

482
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:09,460
 Udo.

483
00:20:09,460 --> 00:20:09,960
 Yeah.

484
00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:10,460
 Yeah.

485
00:20:10,460 --> 00:20:10,960
 That's it.

486
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:12,640
 [INAUDIBLE]

487
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:14,800
 Hey, so listen, we should wrap up in a second.

488
00:20:14,800 --> 00:20:17,520
 But Jack, before we go--

489
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:19,760
 so I haven't actually heard the show yet.

490
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:21,200
 So what episodes are going out?

491
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:23,280
 And what can the listeners expect?

492
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:27,960
 So on February the 24th, we'll launch garlic and banana.

493
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:29,960
 And they'll be released at the same time.

494
00:20:29,960 --> 00:20:32,240
 Yeah, then we'll have weekly episodes from there.

495
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:34,520
 Are you just talking about garlic the entire episode?

496
00:20:34,520 --> 00:20:35,120
 That's amazing.

497
00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:36,560
 That's pure QI, isn't it?

498
00:20:36,560 --> 00:20:37,400
 Yeah.

499
00:20:37,400 --> 00:20:39,520
 The premise is we all bring in our lunchboxes,

500
00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:42,320
 and they have something in them based around garlic.

501
00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:44,720
 And we don't know what they are until we open them.

502
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:45,680
 And sometimes--

503
00:20:45,680 --> 00:20:47,760
 And often, Rosie's is something genuinely delicious,

504
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:50,400
 and then they've brought some kind of weird scientific angle

505
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:51,400
 that you wouldn't actually want to eat.

506
00:20:51,400 --> 00:20:52,440
 From the 1,500s, yeah.

507
00:20:52,440 --> 00:20:55,400
 Because Jack, when we were recording back in Covent Garden,

508
00:20:55,400 --> 00:20:57,760
 Jack would always be sitting just outside the recording

509
00:20:57,760 --> 00:20:58,840
 bit with the glass door.

510
00:20:58,840 --> 00:21:00,320
 And I'd go out and be like, how you doing?

511
00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:01,880
 And he's like, oh, I'm experimenting

512
00:21:01,880 --> 00:21:04,720
 with eating one of each of these things for the entire year.

513
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:06,200
 What was that experiment that you were doing?

514
00:21:06,200 --> 00:21:10,400
 I did try and avoid-- because wheat, rice, and maize

515
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:13,560
 constitute 50% of the global calories eaten.

516
00:21:13,560 --> 00:21:15,720
 So I tried to go a week without eating any of them.

517
00:21:15,720 --> 00:21:16,920
 That's probably what you're remembering.

518
00:21:16,920 --> 00:21:18,760
 So I was eating a lot of quinoa and tida cereals,

519
00:21:18,760 --> 00:21:19,260
 actually.

520
00:21:19,260 --> 00:21:20,920
 You were doing a lot of weird experiments.

521
00:21:20,920 --> 00:21:22,680
 So I just want to say to the listener,

522
00:21:22,680 --> 00:21:24,320
 this is the real deal here.

523
00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:25,560
 But yeah, we really love making it.

524
00:21:25,560 --> 00:21:28,920
 And we'll keep cooking things, even in our own spare time,

525
00:21:28,920 --> 00:21:30,200
 even if we turn the mics off.

526
00:21:30,200 --> 00:21:33,800
 But we'll be chatting food at the office and meeting up

527
00:21:33,800 --> 00:21:34,680
 with Rosie.

528
00:21:34,680 --> 00:21:36,760
 Listen to them, chat food, lunchbox,

529
00:21:36,760 --> 00:21:38,720
 envy, track it down.

530
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:39,720
 You know how to find a podcast.

531
00:21:39,720 --> 00:21:40,120
 Do it.

532
00:21:40,120 --> 00:21:40,760
 Thanks, Jack.

533
00:21:40,760 --> 00:21:42,440
 And there's one all about bananas.

534
00:21:42,440 --> 00:21:43,920
 Yep, that's one of the first few.

535
00:21:43,920 --> 00:21:45,520
 But all those facts you just heard

536
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:47,800
 with the rubbish banana facts and the good banana facts

537
00:21:47,800 --> 00:21:48,840
 are in that episode.

538
00:21:48,840 --> 00:21:50,840
 Thanks for bringing the shit ones to our show, Jack.

539
00:21:50,840 --> 00:21:51,840
 Appreciate it, Jack.

540
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:55,840
 Sloppy Seconds is a good title for a food podcast.

541
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:56,640
 OK.

542
00:21:56,640 --> 00:21:58,560
 All right, now on that note, let's wrap up.

543
00:21:58,560 --> 00:21:59,640
 We'll see you in a couple of weeks

544
00:21:59,640 --> 00:22:00,760
 for another bonus episode.

545
00:22:00,760 --> 00:22:01,560
 Goodbye.

547
