00:00:13,00:00:21,Hello and welcome to a very special bonus episode of Meet the Elf. This one with a twist because
00:00:21,00:00:26,"you've already met him. Let's meet him again. This is Jack Chambers, who I'm sure you remember"
00:00:26,00:00:31,based on everything about him. We probably don't need to go back through your history at QI unless
00:00:31,00:00:37,"you have any new exciting information to tell us about yourself. No, no, I don't think so. I'm"
00:00:37,00:00:42,"another sort of year older and bit less hair on my head and my voice hasn't changed, so maybe you"
00:00:42,00:00:50,"recognise it. Have you become a podcaster since we last spoke? Yeah, we've basically me and Manu,"
00:00:50,00:00:55,"who's also been on Meet the Elf, and our good friend Rosie, who's a food expert. She's a stylist"
00:00:55,00:01:02,and influencer and professional chef. We have created a podcast called Lunchbox Envy and it's
00:01:02,00:01:08,"basically the QI approach to food, which is common to everyone. I think there are very few people"
00:01:08,00:01:12,"except for those breatharians who don't eat food. Yeah, it's a clever subject to choose. Well done."
00:01:12,00:01:21,"This is not so much Meet the Elf as Reheat the Elf. Oh, yeah. Okay, I mean you actually had the"
00:01:21,00:01:26,"word ""meat"" in the title there, but that's cool. That's not solely meat-based. An episode on garlic."
00:01:26,00:01:31,That's true. That's the first one we're going to release on February the 24th. Right. You can
00:01:31,00:01:37,"find details at qi.com/lunchbox. And we've had a preview and it's great. We have, it's very fun."
00:01:37,00:01:42,"It's a very QI fish style, lots of interesting facts about food, but interspersed with genuinely"
00:01:42,00:01:46,"useful cooking tips. Yeah. I mean, my level of cooking is so basic that any cooking tip is very"
00:01:46,00:01:51,"useful to me, like put the toaster in that way and put the toaster. Pan the right way up. Yeah,"
00:01:51,00:01:58,"exactly. But I think even better cooks will find it useful, but it's full of amazing facts. So do"
00:01:58,00:02:04,"listen, but today you've brought a fact for us, I believe, and you deliver it to us by means of a"
00:02:04,00:02:15,"riddle. So my question to you, why can't you make a banana violin? So many reasons. Are we talking?"
00:02:16,00:02:22,"Okay. Firstly, unpack what a banana violin is. Yeah. So let's let's huddle here, guys. So violin"
00:02:22,00:02:28,is an instrument. Yeah. Is it a violin made out of banana or is it like a banana shaped violin?
00:02:28,00:02:32,"Do you think? Well, that's the thing. You've got a good shape where you could twang two bits of string"
00:02:32,00:02:36,"on the side. In fact, you've got those bits of filament that run along the length of the banana."
00:02:36,00:02:40,"So you could just tie one of those at either end and ratchet it up a bit. And then actually,"
00:02:40,00:02:44,"actually, turns out Jack, you can make a banana violin. You got no bow. It's because it doesn't"
00:02:44,00:02:51,"come with a bow. A banana, a straighter banana. Yeah. Is this a violin made out of bananas?"
00:02:51,00:02:59,"Well, I picked a violin not because of acoustic properties, but because it's made of wood. It's"
00:02:59,00:03:05,made of wood. Yes. So what's strange about the banana tree? Bananas are not trees. They're not trees.
00:03:05,00:03:10,"They're herbs. They're herbs. Yeah. The biggest herbaceous plant in the world, in fact. It doesn't"
00:03:10,00:03:17,"have lignin in its stem. So when you see a banana tree, its trunk is basically just folded up leaves."
00:03:17,00:03:22,"And in fact, I have sliced through one and then it's really like mushy and wet inside. There's no"
00:03:22,00:03:26,"like... Well, you do that when you worked on that banana plantation before QI."
00:03:26,00:03:30,"Yeah. Well, you did slicing through a banana tree plant."
00:03:30,00:03:34,"No, that was with my neighbour, actually. She was 76. So she doesn't, you know,"
00:03:34,00:03:39,trust herself with a saw. I don't know why she trusted me. She's got a banana in her garden.
00:03:39,00:03:42,"Yeah, surprisingly. You can use it from Jamaica, right?"
00:03:42,00:03:48,"No, hang on. I sure I've researched recently the giant, the Kiwi giant banana,"
00:03:48,00:03:54,"by which I mean the New Zealand giant banana, which is very, very tall, but it only grows in valleys."
00:03:54,00:04:00,"And that's because bananas are not woody, so they can't stand up to high winds."
00:04:00,00:04:06,So only in a deep valley where there's no high wind can this giant banana thrive.
00:04:07,00:04:11,"Interesting. And I read that that's why the leaves get so tattered in the wind,"
00:04:11,00:04:15,because then get become less like sails and less able to blow the whole tree over.
00:04:15,00:04:21,"So sorry, you're saying an entire, the entire trunk of a banana tree is just, it's just all leaves."
00:04:21,00:04:25,Can you picture it? It doesn't look like a trunk. It's not like it's disguised itself.
00:04:25,00:04:28,It hasn't painted itself like a park. I'm picturing an oak.
00:04:28,00:04:33,"That's the kind of tree I'm picturing right now. No, it's a chunky, girthy..."
00:04:33,00:04:36,"But it does look like a tree. No, no, it's odd."
00:04:36,00:04:40,"And if you asked like a four year old to draw a tree, it would look a little bit like a banana"
00:04:40,00:04:43,"tree, right? Yeah. It's the same shape. Yeah."
00:04:43,00:04:46,"Was it banana trees that Sean Locke once mentioned on QI, they move?"
00:04:46,00:04:51,"You said they walk? Yes, they walk. Is that because why they walk in Jack?"
00:04:51,00:04:56,"You've got a food podcast now? This is within your purview, not..."
00:04:56,00:04:58,"Not as easy as Alex, is it buddy?"
00:04:58,00:05:04,"I've heard this the case with the palm tree, which kind of has like the roots are above ground,"
00:05:04,00:05:10,"kind of like a crab, and then it will kill off one of the roots on one side and grow a"
00:05:10,00:05:14,new root on the other side. So it can move about two meters a year. I don't know if that's the
00:05:14,00:05:19,"same thing. Wow. Have you ever seen, speaking of weird tree roots, I saw the other day a specific"
00:05:19,00:05:23,"tree, and I can't remember what it is, but it's one of the trees that grows in kind of swampy,"
00:05:23,00:05:29,"waterlogged areas, and its roots grow really oddly. So you'll see a tree and then around it,"
00:05:29,00:05:35,"it's like it's got 100 or 200 spikes, like big spikes, meter long spikes sticking up out of"
00:05:35,00:05:40,"the ground really pointed, and there it's roots, and its roots grow back up out of the earth,"
00:05:40,00:05:44,"like it's got this massive defensive wall all around it, and we just don't know why it does that."
00:05:44,00:05:48,"We think it might be for stabilizing it, but... It's a tropical thing."
00:05:48,00:05:52,"It's in like mangrove swamps. So yeah, tropical, sorry."
00:05:52,00:05:59,"Is it cypress? No. Cypress the tree. Yeah, yeah. Cypress the country. No, no, Cypress the tree."
00:05:59,00:06:04,"It's trees that grow in mangrove swampy type areas, they're quite waterlogged, but it looks so cool."
00:06:04,00:06:09,"It's the catch on where he crawls. They've got a special name, because we were researching a body"
00:06:09,00:06:12,"part. I think there might be elbows. We were researching elbows recently, knees. They're called"
00:06:12,00:06:17,knees. I've got it. We had to research knees. The tree's knees. And they're called the tree's knees.
00:06:17,00:06:22,Very good. So some trees have knees. Do they have nectar? Could you make honey from a tree's knees?
00:06:23,00:06:26,"Do you see where I'm going? Yeah. I think no one's, no one's tried."
00:06:26,00:06:29,"Okay. Oh, I thought you were saying that as another body part, as a neck."
00:06:29,00:06:33,"Yeah. No, no. Bees, trees, knees. Bees, trees, knees. Oh, see. It's good."
00:06:33,00:06:39,"This new show's gonna be good. More of these puns. It's all rhyming. Keep doing shows, isn't it?"
00:06:39,00:06:43,"Yeah, it's done in iambic pentameter, actually. They've got trunks, which is another body part."
00:06:43,00:06:46,"I've got a trunk. Yes, you do. What's your trunk? We all do."
00:06:46,00:06:51,This is your trunk. You call the torso your trunk? Yeah. Don't you? We all do.
00:06:51,00:06:55,"We, well, I'm one of the four people there. I don't know if it's my trunk."
00:06:55,00:06:58,"It's a bit, it's a bit old fashioned, calling it your trunk."
00:06:58,00:07:05,"Yes. Okay. You know, you might sort of salatiously refer to a woman from the 1920s as having some sort"
00:07:05,00:07:10,"of, what do you? Well, I don't know. Having a nice trunk. Isn't that just me? That's just you, pal."
00:07:10,00:07:14,Love your trunk. That's you and Charlie Chaplin. Yeah.
00:07:15,00:07:21,"Trunk magazine. Speaking of, actually, just to get back to bananas. He famously said"
00:07:21,00:07:24,"the funniest thing to do is to have the banana skin on the floor,"
00:07:24,00:07:28,and then they can carefully step over the banana skin and fall down a manhole.
00:07:28,00:07:33,"Yeah, he told that to David Niven. It's in an autobiography by David Niven,"
00:07:33,00:07:39,"because someone, he overheard, sorry, it wasn't to David Niven. Niven overheard him"
00:07:39,00:07:44,"responding to a comedian who was saying, how do I make the most used gag in cinema"
00:07:44,00:07:49,"funny again? And Chaplin, at the top of his brilliant brain, said, yeah,"
00:07:49,00:07:53,"turns around, looks at it, goes, huh, relief, walks into a manhole."
00:07:53,00:07:57,"We get, we get the comedy. You didn't need to go through the emotional role."
00:07:57,00:07:59,I do. That's where he acted it out.
00:07:59,00:08:03,"When Jack's a hundred eps in, he'll know how to tell stories of it more dramatically."
00:08:03,00:08:04,"I just, this is a mentoring."
00:08:04,00:08:08,"I do feel it's amazing that you can mention anything to Dan, and Dan will say, yes,"
00:08:08,00:08:13,"David Niven once overheard Charlie Chaplin tell an anecdote about this,"
00:08:13,00:08:16,"and you'll have the book, and you'll know the page, you know, it's great."
00:08:16,00:08:19,But they have been a comedy trope for a long time. I think they first appeared in
00:08:19,00:08:24,"vaudeville shows because they were, it was back when New York was getting,"
00:08:24,00:08:30,"you know, more and more populated, and they hadn't really sorted out how to get the bins"
00:08:30,00:08:34,"removed. So you'd find trash on the street, and so in the cartoons and the newspapers,"
00:08:34,00:08:40,"they would use the banana skin on the street to represent like Mucky New York, you know."
00:08:40,00:08:41,So people thrown trash around.
00:08:41,00:08:46,"I was reading about this just yesterday, about the New York situation, because New York has a"
00:08:46,00:08:50,"lot of rats, and it turns out it's just because they put their rubbish out in bags and not in bins."
00:08:50,00:08:55,"And that's, and it all dates back to a bin strike by the city's bin men in 1968,"
00:08:55,00:08:59,which is when they started just having to put their rubbish out in bags.
00:08:59,00:09:00,And then it became the norm.
00:09:00,00:09:04,"And then it became the norm. And then, and recently they've been trying amazingly,"
00:09:04,00:09:09,"having actual bins, which they put out, and astonishingly, the rat population has declined."
00:09:09,00:09:13,"And for years they've been trying, what if we make stronger poison for the rats?"
00:09:13,00:09:17,"And actually no, the answer is it's not to give the rats an all night banquet every night."
00:09:17,00:09:24,We have it in London in some places. We used to have that in our London house.
00:09:24,00:09:24,What?
00:09:24,00:09:26,What if we just put the bins out in bags.
00:09:26,00:09:28,Just put raw bags out on the street.
00:09:28,00:09:29,"Raw bag, yeah."
00:09:29,00:09:35,"Yeah, that's a bad idea, and you deserve to have rats, and you should have used bins."
00:09:35,00:09:37,"Thank you, but I blame the council not myself."
00:09:37,00:09:40,It's actually usually the foxes who got there first.
00:09:40,00:09:45,"But that, so the whole New York thing, then led to that becoming seen as you would slip on a banana."
00:09:45,00:09:48,"And that would be funny when people saw it, Sean and Freud."
00:09:48,00:09:51,"And then there was a guy, do you know Jack, the comedian who, I don't know his name,"
00:09:51,00:09:55,but that was his act. He would go on stage and he would just slip on bananas.
00:09:55,00:09:58,"Because it was just such like a new, great gag."
00:09:58,00:10:01,"As a whole act, was this like a big Stuart Lee set piece, like an hour of just the same."
00:10:01,00:10:04,Filled up and up.
00:10:04,00:10:07,"It was, it was back in the day where you would do a spot"
00:10:07,00:10:09,"on, so it's like, ""Now please introduce."""
00:10:09,00:10:11,And then you'd come out in a tux or whatever and slip on the banana.
00:10:11,00:10:14,And you'd do your five minutes and then you'd hair off to the other side of town.
00:10:14,00:10:16,"Yeah, and it was a huge hit."
00:10:16,00:10:16,I bet.
00:10:16,00:10:17,There's a banana slipper.
00:10:17,00:10:21,And then they tested it on mythbusters.
00:10:21,00:10:22,"Oh yeah, they did, yeah, yeah."
00:10:22,00:10:23,To see whether or not it truly is the...
00:10:23,00:10:24,They're actually slippery.
00:10:24,00:10:26,"Yeah, if they are slippery or not."
00:10:26,00:10:28,Because all slightly decayed vegetable matter will be slippery.
00:10:28,00:10:28,I think so.
00:10:28,00:10:30,"You can slip on an aubergine, you can slip on a tomato."
00:10:30,00:10:34,"But there's a thing about the inside of a banana, which makes it particularly"
00:10:34,00:10:36,"slippy, that little, well, I don't know."
00:10:36,00:10:37,"I mean, Jack, you're..."
00:10:37,00:10:39,You're the banana expert.
00:10:39,00:10:42,"My guess would be that the reason it's famous for bananas is because you don't,"
00:10:42,00:10:43,"like an aubergine, you eat it all."
00:10:43,00:10:43,"Yes, you do."
00:10:43,00:10:45,Or other vegetable you eat it all.
00:10:45,00:10:49,"In the olden days, people didn't have as much food as you and I."
00:10:49,00:10:50,Why don't we feel bad?
00:10:50,00:10:52,"Orange, the orange, the apple?"
00:10:52,00:10:53,"Orange peel, it should have been an orange."
00:10:53,00:10:54,"Yeah, the apple."
00:10:54,00:10:54,Which bit of it?
00:10:54,00:10:56,"Oh, you can slip on apple cores."
00:10:56,00:10:57,"Yeah, apple."
00:10:57,00:10:59,"You can't know, but it doesn't spread out as nicely and create such a good"
00:10:59,00:11:00,skate for your foot.
00:11:00,00:11:02,I think it's just easy to draw.
00:11:02,00:11:07,"Like, as a cartoonist, you would think, oh, I could draw an orange peel,"
00:11:07,00:11:08,but a banana skate.
00:11:08,00:11:09,"Oh, look, it's just funny."
00:11:09,00:11:09,Banana.
00:11:09,00:11:09,Exactly.
00:11:09,00:11:10,Say the word out loud.
00:11:10,00:11:11,Look at it.
00:11:11,00:11:15,How much of bananas' cultural clout is due to the name and the bright color?
00:11:15,00:11:15,"Yeah, yeah."
00:11:15,00:11:16,And the shape.
00:11:16,00:11:17,And the shape.
00:11:17,00:11:17,And the shape.
00:11:17,00:11:17,And the shape.
00:11:17,00:11:18,It's very phallic.
00:11:18,00:11:19,It's brilliant.
00:11:19,00:11:20,Candle salad.
00:11:20,00:11:22,"In fact, you'll hear about that in the podcast, and I won't spoil it."
00:11:22,00:11:24,"Oh, I've seen a lot of salads."
00:11:24,00:11:25,He probably talks about it as well.
00:11:25,00:11:26,"Oh, yeah."
00:11:26,00:11:31,"Interestingly, the word banana is actually the only Walloff loan word I can find."
00:11:31,00:11:32,And Walloff being the language of Senegal.
00:11:32,00:11:37,"There is a theory that dig as in, can you dig it?"
00:11:37,00:11:38,"You know, do you dig me?"
00:11:38,00:11:44,"It comes from a Walloff word, but not the, you know, the digging as in digging soil."
00:11:44,00:11:45,Dig it.
00:11:45,00:11:46,"Oh, yeah, yeah."
00:11:46,00:11:48,Because it feels like can you dig it?
00:11:48,00:11:50,It just comes from digging.
00:11:50,00:11:51,"Yeah, that doesn't make sense."
00:11:51,00:11:56,"No, I can't think of any even long-winded way around why that would make sense."
00:11:56,00:11:57,Do you dig that?
00:11:57,00:12:00,"There's a Walloff word dig out, which means to understand."
00:12:00,00:12:05,So they think it might have come via the American slave trade into the American South.
00:12:05,00:12:05,Right.
00:12:05,00:12:06,"Okay, I buy it."
00:12:06,00:12:08,You sound very easily persuadable.
00:12:08,00:12:09,"Oh, I'm in the market."
00:12:09,00:12:10,We're going to put up a fight.
00:12:10,00:12:10,No.
00:12:10,00:12:13,You're in the market for new slang to bring into your life.
00:12:13,00:12:16,"Sorry, you can dig it."
00:12:16,00:12:18,New etymologies of slang is what I'm looking for.
00:12:18,00:12:21,That's cool.
00:12:21,00:12:22,That's very cool.
00:12:22,00:12:22,That's very cool.
00:12:22,00:12:26,"Are they, is Senegal known globally for bananas, generally?"
00:12:26,00:12:30,"No, I think they originated in Southeast Asia."
00:12:30,00:12:33,Sort of the Philippines and what is now Malaysia.
00:12:33,00:12:35,But they did spread around the world quite quickly.
00:12:35,00:12:36,What is now Malaysia?
00:12:36,00:12:37,You can just call it Malaysia.
00:12:37,00:12:41,This is hundreds of years ago.
00:12:41,00:12:41,Yeah.
00:12:41,00:12:42,It's not what he calls it.
00:12:42,00:12:47,"And of course, I went to what is now Zimbabwe language."
00:12:47,00:12:48,I love these eyes.
00:12:48,00:12:52,I suppose what was Pangea and it's now the Philippines.
00:12:52,00:12:56,What's your favorite banana fact then?
00:12:56,00:12:59,"I, well, I mentioned them all in the podcast, in fact,"
00:12:59,00:13:01,"which you'll have to listen to all of the things I'm saying here,"
00:13:01,00:13:03,none of the which I mentioned in the podcast.
00:13:03,00:13:05,"Wait, so these are your least favorite banana facts."
00:13:05,00:13:06,"Yeah, I think so."
00:13:06,00:13:07,But there's so many amazing things.
00:13:07,00:13:10,"I've got way more facts, actually, about a cousin of the banana,"
00:13:10,00:13:12,the pseudo-banana.
00:13:12,00:13:13,And it's known as the NSET.
00:13:13,00:13:15,I don't know if you've come across this.
00:13:15,00:13:16,I don't know.
00:13:16,00:13:18,"A cousin of the bananas, like I say, it's a pseudo-banana."
00:13:18,00:13:20,It's native to Ethiopia.
00:13:20,00:13:21,"And there are about 20 million people,"
00:13:21,00:13:24,"which is a fifth of the population of Ethiopia,"
00:13:24,00:13:26,who rely on this as a staple crop.
00:13:27,00:13:31,"But as I mentioned, the trunk is not made of lignin."
00:13:31,00:13:32,"It's not wood, as we know it."
00:13:32,00:13:33,And they use the trunk.
00:13:33,00:13:35,"In fact, the fruit is the only thing"
00:13:35,00:13:37,that's inevitable about this tree.
00:13:37,00:13:41,And it's been described as the tree against hunger
00:13:41,00:13:43,because it grows so fast.
00:13:43,00:13:47,It grows so commonly and it grows all year round.
00:13:47,00:13:48,There's no season for it.
00:13:48,00:13:50,"It propagates, so you don't need the seeds."
00:13:50,00:13:52,"Yeah, they've been cooking it in Southwestern Ethiopia"
00:13:52,00:13:53,for hundreds of years.
00:13:53,00:13:57,"You basically chop the tree down, grind up the trunk,"
00:13:57,00:14:01,and then leave it underground for up to two years to ferment.
00:14:01,00:14:03,And then you make bread out of the powder that comes out.
00:14:03,00:14:06,"Wait, so does it grow bananas, which you eat normally?"
00:14:06,00:14:08,"No, you don't eat them because they're inevitable."
00:14:08,00:14:09,"Right, I see."
00:14:09,00:14:10,So you only eat this bit of trunk.
00:14:10,00:14:12,"Yeah, and the roots as well."
00:14:12,00:14:15,The roots create tubers of potatoes.
00:14:15,00:14:16,Everything but the fruit.
00:14:16,00:14:17,Everything but the banana.
00:14:17,00:14:19,"Come on, that's a good name for something."
00:14:19,00:14:20,Everything but the banana.
00:14:20,00:14:21,That should be the name for your podcast.
00:14:21,00:14:22,Change it.
00:14:22,00:14:24,Still trying to think what this is.
00:14:24,00:14:25,Can you make any instrument out of bananas?
00:14:25,00:14:27,We're trying to think what what is.
00:14:27,00:14:28,You know he gave us the answer.
00:14:28,00:14:29,You're kidding.
00:14:29,00:14:30,The answer's already happened.
00:14:30,00:14:31,I'm so sorry.
00:14:31,00:14:32,Did it happen right at the top of the show?
00:14:32,00:14:32,"Yeah, right at the top."
00:14:32,00:14:33,"Yeah, it didn't take long."
00:14:33,00:14:35,I thought you were teasing us with a detail there.
00:14:35,00:14:36,"No, I know."
00:14:36,00:14:38,I know he just slipped it on the razor.
00:14:38,00:14:39,We've just been going on this whole time.
00:14:39,00:14:40,Yeah.
00:14:40,00:14:41,"No, I agree."
00:14:41,00:14:41,It's looking confusing.
00:14:41,00:14:42,We've sort of changed the format.
00:14:42,00:14:44,We did the whole format in the first 30 seconds.
00:14:44,00:14:45,You've already met me.
00:14:45,00:14:46,"You know the idea, you know."
00:14:46,00:14:47,We've been rambling on.
00:14:47,00:14:49,"Wait, so what was the answer again then?"
00:14:49,00:14:50,Do you know what the question was?
00:14:50,00:14:51,Yeah.
00:14:51,00:14:51,What's the question?
00:14:51,00:14:53,Why can't you make a banana violin?
00:14:53,00:14:55,"No, you know the answer, I think."
00:14:55,00:14:56,So do you know the answer?
00:14:56,00:14:57,No.
00:14:57,00:14:58,"Well, Jack said it."
00:14:58,00:14:59,We've said it a few times.
00:14:59,00:15:00,What do violins made of?
00:15:00,00:15:01,Wood.
00:15:01,00:15:02,"Well, that bit I got."
00:15:02,00:15:02,Right.
00:15:02,00:15:04,So what do bananas not make?
00:15:04,00:15:05,"Yeah, they gave."
00:15:05,00:15:05,So you know the answer.
00:15:05,00:15:07,"Oh, I thought that was just a clue along the way."
00:15:07,00:15:09,It's like being a primary school lesson.
00:15:09,00:15:10,"At the end of the lesson, the teacher's like,"
00:15:10,00:15:12,"right, so two plus two is?"
00:15:12,00:15:12,Have a banana.
00:15:12,00:15:15,"No, because the format of this show"
00:15:15,00:15:16,was we get clues along the way.
00:15:16,00:15:18,I didn't expect it to be so quickly.
00:15:18,00:15:21,I thought there was one more plot twist to it.
00:15:21,00:15:22,"Yeah, well, you know, we know each other quite well."
00:15:22,00:15:23,It's still a good answer.
00:15:23,00:15:24,You're not knocking it.
00:15:24,00:15:25,I just thought it was a clue.
00:15:25,00:15:28,This is like David Foster Wallace novel way.
00:15:28,00:15:30,"You get the novel, but then most of the book"
00:15:30,00:15:30,is just footnotes.
00:15:30,00:15:31,"Yeah, right."
00:15:31,00:15:32,And we've just been in the footnotes for so long.
00:15:32,00:15:33,So we're in the footnotes here.
00:15:33,00:15:33,Yeah.
00:15:33,00:15:34,Do you have a second question?
00:15:34,00:15:39,I feel like every else should have a second question
00:15:39,00:15:41,in case we want to be like Simon Cowell.
00:15:41,00:15:42,Or you just get it straight away.
00:15:42,00:15:43,"Yeah, we're halfway through, we wave our hands."
00:15:43,00:15:46,"Yeah, we have a second."
00:15:47,00:15:48,And then that's the one that really launches you
00:15:48,00:15:51,into the hearts of the UK.
00:15:51,00:15:55,"So speaking of Ethiopia, it's a very unique place."
00:15:55,00:15:59,"I think partly because it's pretty much 1,500 to 4,000"
00:15:59,00:16:00,meters up.
00:16:00,00:16:03,So it's described as the roof of Africa sometimes.
00:16:03,00:16:04,OK.
00:16:04,00:16:08,"Not as low at its point as 1,500."
00:16:08,00:16:10,"Most of it is over 1,000 meters."
00:16:10,00:16:12,But there are bits that are almost sea level.
00:16:12,00:16:13,Cool.
00:16:13,00:16:15,"It's Lesotho, the only country in the world,"
00:16:15,00:16:17,"with it's all above 1,000 meters."
00:16:17,00:16:18,Lesotho doesn't count it.
00:16:18,00:16:19,It's a dot on that.
00:16:19,00:16:22,"Sorry, no offense."
00:16:22,00:16:23,And Lesotho listeners.
00:16:23,00:16:28,"But yeah, Ethiopia is also, it wasn't colonized"
00:16:28,00:16:29,by the Europeans.
00:16:29,00:16:31,And it's the only part of Africa I think there wasn't.
00:16:31,00:16:35,Which might have meant a lot of the traditions have survived.
00:16:35,00:16:36,"But yeah, they eat--"
00:16:36,00:16:38,I don't know if you've been to Ethiopian restaurants.
00:16:38,00:16:40,They often serve you injera bread.
00:16:40,00:16:41,Got to have injera.
00:16:41,00:16:42,It's elite.
00:16:42,00:16:44,It's like it's used as a plate.
00:16:44,00:16:46,So it's like a big pan cook.
00:16:46,00:16:50,And then they put all sort of curries and stews and meats on.
00:16:50,00:16:53,And then you just take bits off and scoop up the vegetables
00:16:53,00:16:54,and eat them.
00:16:54,00:16:55,Eat the plate as you go.
00:16:55,00:16:56,"Yeah, with my favorite--"
00:16:56,00:16:58,I reckon it was my favorite cuisine in London for about a year.
00:16:58,00:16:59,It's bloody delicious.
00:16:59,00:17:01,But then there's only one of it.
00:17:01,00:17:03,So once you had it every week for a year.
00:17:03,00:17:04,But it is very cool.
00:17:04,00:17:06,There's some huge percentage of the world who don't use--
00:17:06,00:17:08,they use their hands to eat everything.
00:17:08,00:17:08,Right.
00:17:08,00:17:09,I'm not sure where it came from.
00:17:09,00:17:12,There's a quote attributed to the Shah of Iran.
00:17:12,00:17:15,"And he said, ""Eating meals with cutlery"
00:17:15,00:17:18,"is like making love through an interpreter."""
00:17:18,00:17:19,[LAUGHTER]
00:17:19,00:17:20,She's a bit pretentious.
00:17:20,00:17:22,Which I actually think could be a--
00:17:22,00:17:24,Add a frisson to the experience.
00:17:24,00:17:26,[LAUGHTER]
00:17:26,00:17:26,Ooh.
00:17:26,00:17:28,"He says, ooh."
00:17:28,00:17:31,[LAUGHTER]
00:17:31,00:17:34,"But yeah, so injera bread is made of teff,"
00:17:34,00:17:37,which is a cereal that's not particularly well-known.
00:17:37,00:17:38,T-E-Double-F.
00:17:38,00:17:40,It's a species of love grass.
00:17:40,00:17:42,Have you eaten all these?
00:17:42,00:17:43,I haven't eaten--
00:17:43,00:17:48,Koccho is the name of the bread you make from the end set.
00:17:48,00:17:49,I haven't eaten that.
00:17:49,00:17:52,I did hear a BBC radio for--
00:17:52,00:17:53,From my period.
00:17:53,00:17:54,"Yeah, that's what I'm saying."
00:17:54,00:17:55,[INTERPOSING VOICES]
00:17:55,00:17:57,I heard a woman on BBC Radio 4.
00:17:57,00:17:58,He found a restaurant.
00:17:58,00:18:01,"If I was setting up a food truck, I'd call it teff-steff."
00:18:01,00:18:03,[LAUGHTER]
00:18:03,00:18:03,Steff.
00:18:03,00:18:06,And I'd have to hire a woman called Stephanie to run it
00:18:06,00:18:06,day-to-day.
00:18:06,00:18:07,[LAUGHTER]
00:18:07,00:18:08,But I still--
00:18:08,00:18:10,"Why wouldn't you call it ""steff-steff""?"
00:18:10,00:18:10,That's even better.
00:18:10,00:18:11,"It's a ""steff-teff."""
00:18:11,00:18:12,You're on 10%.
00:18:12,00:18:14,[LAUGHTER]
00:18:14,00:18:16,Here's one for you all.
00:18:16,00:18:23,"""Name a very posh middle-class North London grain."""
00:18:23,00:18:24,"Oh, um--"
00:18:24,00:18:26,Are you shooting for someone like Quinoa?
00:18:26,00:18:27,"Well, obviously, Quinoa originally"
00:18:27,00:18:29,"was eaten by a bunch of people at the moment, is?"
00:18:29,00:18:31,"Yes, that's not the point I'm making."
00:18:31,00:18:32,"OK, sorry."
00:18:32,00:18:33,"Sorry, I'm sorry."
00:18:33,00:18:35,Do you want more suggestions?
00:18:35,00:18:35,"No, no, no, that's fine."
00:18:35,00:18:37,Anna's fallen into the bed.
00:18:37,00:18:38,She's currently impaled at the base of it.
00:18:38,00:18:39,I don't need any more.
00:18:39,00:18:41,She's impaled at the mangrove knee.
00:18:41,00:18:43,"No more bodies on the bamboo, please."
00:18:43,00:18:45,It's not a grain.
00:18:45,00:18:46,Quinoa's not a grain.
00:18:46,00:18:47,Uday cereal.
00:18:47,00:18:48,Yeah.
00:18:48,00:18:51,Do you need more genetics for this series of QI?
00:18:51,00:18:51,It's not a grain.
00:18:51,00:18:52,It's not a grain.
00:18:52,00:18:53,"I was like, what is it?"
00:18:53,00:18:54,Niner's buckwheat.
00:18:54,00:18:55,I can't remember.
00:18:55,00:18:58,It's something like a sort of kind of edible fish or something.
00:18:58,00:18:59,I don't know.
00:18:59,00:19:00,It's just--
00:19:00,00:19:03,It's probably a flower or--
00:19:03,00:19:04,"Well, it's like--"
00:19:04,00:19:06,Redbush tea is actually a pea.
00:19:06,00:19:08,So you'd ask for a cup of pea if you're being accurate.
00:19:08,00:19:09,Nice.
00:19:09,00:19:10,But don't do that.
00:19:10,00:19:13,"And going back to bananas, they're actually berries."
00:19:13,00:19:14,Herb is a berry.
00:19:14,00:19:16,I thought it was a herb.
00:19:16,00:19:20,"Well, the tree is a herb, as in it's a herbaceous plant."
00:19:20,00:19:24,I think herb is a culinary term to describe small leaves
00:19:24,00:19:26,that you would add to the dishes to give them flavor.
00:19:26,00:19:28,"And obviously, we don't do that with bananas."
00:19:28,00:19:32,But herbaceous plant is a botanist term
00:19:32,00:19:35,to describe something without a woody stem.
00:19:35,00:19:38,"And yeah, technically, a banana is a berry."
00:19:38,00:19:39,Very nice.
00:19:39,00:19:39,Yeah.
00:19:39,00:19:40,Lovely stuff.
00:19:40,00:19:42,Can you make a violin out of quinoa?
00:19:42,00:19:44,These are-- so they're seeds.
00:19:44,00:19:46,Is that it?
00:19:46,00:19:46,"What, quinoa?"
00:19:46,00:19:47,Yeah.
00:19:47,00:19:48,I think that's what you're eating is a seed.
00:19:48,00:19:49,The seeds of the cereal.
00:19:49,00:19:50,"Well, not a cereal, but a--"
00:19:50,00:19:51,Yeah.
00:19:51,00:19:52,I really thought you were winging it when you said pseudo cereal.
00:19:52,00:19:53,No.
00:19:53,00:19:54,You just-- you just knew.
00:19:54,00:19:54,I thought that went up.
00:19:54,00:19:55,Buckwheat as well.
00:19:55,00:19:56,A buckwheat isn't wheat.
00:19:56,00:19:57,It's not even a cereal.
00:19:57,00:19:59,It's a pseudo cereal.
00:19:59,00:20:00,I love this-- I love this stuff.
00:20:00,00:20:02,It's what got me into QI in the first place.
00:20:02,00:20:03,All the pseudo stuff.
00:20:03,00:20:04,Minor correctness.
00:20:04,00:20:05,That's what it got down in as well.
00:20:05,00:20:07,But I think--
00:20:07,00:20:08,Quite a big gap between my pseudo and--
00:20:08,00:20:09,Udo.
00:20:09,00:20:09,Yeah.
00:20:09,00:20:10,Yeah.

00:20:12,00:20:14,"Hey, so listen, we should wrap up in a second."
00:20:14,00:20:17,"But Jack, before we go--"
00:20:17,00:20:19,so I haven't actually heard the show yet.
00:20:19,00:20:21,So what episodes are going out?
00:20:21,00:20:23,And what can the listeners expect?
00:20:23,00:20:27,"So on February the 24th, we'll launch garlic and banana."
00:20:27,00:20:29,And they'll be released at the same time.
00:20:29,00:20:32,"Yeah, then we'll have weekly episodes from there."
00:20:32,00:20:34,Are you just talking about garlic the entire episode?
00:20:34,00:20:35,That's amazing.
00:20:35,00:20:36,"That's pure QI, isn't it?"
00:20:36,00:20:37,Yeah.
00:20:37,00:20:39,"The premise is we all bring in our lunchboxes,"
00:20:39,00:20:42,and they have something in them based around garlic.
00:20:42,00:20:44,And we don't know what they are until we open them.
00:20:44,00:20:45,And sometimes--
00:20:45,00:20:47,"And often, Rosie's is something genuinely delicious,"
00:20:47,00:20:50,and then they've brought some kind of weird scientific angle
00:20:50,00:20:51,that you wouldn't actually want to eat.
00:20:51,00:20:52,"From the 1,500s, yeah."
00:20:52,00:20:55,"Because Jack, when we were recording back in Covent Garden,"
00:20:55,00:20:57,Jack would always be sitting just outside the recording
00:20:57,00:20:58,bit with the glass door.
00:20:58,00:21:00,"And I'd go out and be like, how you doing?"
00:21:00,00:21:01,"And he's like, oh, I'm experimenting"
00:21:01,00:21:04,with eating one of each of these things for the entire year.
00:21:04,00:21:06,What was that experiment that you were doing?
00:21:06,00:21:10,"I did try and avoid-- because wheat, rice, and maize"
00:21:10,00:21:13,constitute 50% of the global calories eaten.
00:21:13,00:21:15,So I tried to go a week without eating any of them.
00:21:15,00:21:16,That's probably what you're remembering.
00:21:16,00:21:18,"So I was eating a lot of quinoa and tida cereals,"
00:21:18,00:21:19,actually.
00:21:19,00:21:20,You were doing a lot of weird experiments.
00:21:20,00:21:22,"So I just want to say to the listener,"
00:21:22,00:21:24,this is the real deal here.
00:21:24,00:21:25,"But yeah, we really love making it."
00:21:25,00:21:28,"And we'll keep cooking things, even in our own spare time,"
00:21:28,00:21:30,even if we turn the mics off.
00:21:30,00:21:33,But we'll be chatting food at the office and meeting up
00:21:33,00:21:34,with Rosie.
00:21:34,00:21:36,"Listen to them, chat food, lunchbox,"
00:21:36,00:21:38,"envy, track it down."
00:21:38,00:21:39,You know how to find a podcast.
00:21:39,00:21:40,Do it.
00:21:40,00:21:40,"Thanks, Jack."
00:21:40,00:21:42,And there's one all about bananas.
00:21:42,00:21:43,"Yep, that's one of the first few."
00:21:43,00:21:45,But all those facts you just heard
00:21:45,00:21:47,with the rubbish banana facts and the good banana facts
00:21:47,00:21:48,are in that episode.
00:21:48,00:21:50,"Thanks for bringing the shit ones to our show, Jack."
00:21:50,00:21:51,"Appreciate it, Jack."
00:21:51,00:21:55,Sloppy Seconds is a good title for a food podcast.
00:21:55,00:21:56,OK.
00:21:56,00:21:58,"All right, now on that note, let's wrap up."
00:21:58,00:21:59,We'll see you in a couple of weeks
00:21:59,00:22:00,for another bonus episode.
00:22:00,00:22:01,Goodbye.
