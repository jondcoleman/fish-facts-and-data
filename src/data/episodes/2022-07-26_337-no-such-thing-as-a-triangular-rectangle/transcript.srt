00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,000
 Hey guys, Andy here. Just before we start this week's show, we have an exciting announcement to make which is that we are returning to the stage.

2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:15,440
 We have a show. It's a live show booked in and it's going to be at the London podcast festival later this month.

3
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:22,840
 It's going to be on the 27th of September at King's Place, which is in London. It's going to be at 7pm and it is going to be so much fun.

4
00:00:22,840 --> 00:00:31,600
 But Andy, I don't live in London and/or I don't want to go to a gig because I'm a bit worried about leaving the house at the moment. Can I see the show?

5
00:00:31,600 --> 00:00:41,480
 Of course you can, James, because not only is it being done very carefully with only a very limited number of tickets being sold to its all-social distance, you can also get streaming tickets.

6
00:00:41,480 --> 00:00:48,680
 So you can go online and at that time you can watch us make fools of ourselves with stupid facts on stage.

7
00:00:48,680 --> 00:00:51,000
 So how do I get these tickets, Andrew?

8
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:58,520
 James, all you have to do is go to qi.com/fishevents and I'll say that again, qi.com/fishevents.

9
00:00:58,520 --> 00:01:02,560
 And when I say events, I mean event because it is the only thing in our diaries.

10
00:01:02,560 --> 00:01:08,360
 So for your possibly last ever chance to see us on a stage, just go there.

11
00:01:08,360 --> 00:01:09,760
 No, we'll be back on top next year.

12
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:11,760
 Oh, I hope so.

13
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:15,360
 But Andrew, what is going to happen next?

14
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:18,760
 The show is going to happen next. Oh, I better do that. Yeah, on with the show.

15
00:01:18,760 --> 00:01:20,760
 On with the podcast.

16
00:01:21,760 --> 00:01:23,760
 [Music]

17
00:01:23,760 --> 00:01:42,760
 Hello and welcome to another episode of No Such Thing As a Fish, a weekly podcast coming to you from four undisclosed locations in the UK.

18
00:01:42,760 --> 00:01:44,760
 My name is Dan Schreiber.

19
00:01:44,760 --> 00:01:48,760
 I am sitting here with James Harkin, Andrew Honto Murray and Anna Czazinski.

20
00:01:48,760 --> 00:01:53,760
 And once again, we have gathered round the microphones with our four favourite facts from the last seven days.

21
00:01:53,760 --> 00:01:58,760
 And in no particular order, here we go. Starting with you, Anna.

22
00:01:58,760 --> 00:02:06,760
 My fact this week is that by complete coincidence, the centre of North America is called Centre.

23
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:09,760
 It's amazing. It's mad.

24
00:02:09,760 --> 00:02:15,760
 So a lot of people weirdly put quite a lot of effort into working out the geographic centre of various places.

25
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:19,760
 And this is the latest research on the centre of the whole of North America.

26
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:24,760
 And it's mainland North America, so not including the islands.

27
00:02:24,760 --> 00:02:30,760
 And this research was done by a university of buffalo geologists called Peter Rodgerson.

28
00:02:30,760 --> 00:02:36,760
 And he worked out this mathematical way of defining the centre of a place which has never been used before.

29
00:02:36,760 --> 00:02:40,760
 And essentially, he ran his sums, ran his algorithms.

30
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:44,760
 And the place that was thrown up was a place called Centre in North Dakota.

31
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:47,760
 It's quite a bit of a total chance. It's insane.

32
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:51,760
 It's tiny, isn't it? It's 1.24 kilometres square.

33
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:54,760
 So it's not even like it's a big place that had a big chance of being it.

34
00:02:54,760 --> 00:02:59,760
 No. It is quite weird because there's no way of actually working out the middle of somewhere.

35
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:01,760
 There's no universally agreed way.

36
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:08,760
 So his mathematical definition is that the centre's location minimises the sum of squared distances to all other points in a region.

37
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:11,760
 So if you want to work out the middle of something, there you go. That's how you do it.

38
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:17,760
 The way he changed it is that he realised the way we've worked out the middle of places before hasn't accounted for the curvature of the Earth.

39
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:21,760
 And so that actually affects distances whereabouts on the curvature of the Earth you are.

40
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:23,760
 So he used this special 3D projection.

41
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:29,760
 And I wonder how many different methods he came up with before it yielded somewhere in the centre.

42
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:38,760
 Well, he reckons that his isn't exactly perfect because he hasn't taken into account that the planet is a slight ellipsoid so that it's not a perfect bowl.

43
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:43,760
 So maybe when he moves through, he might find out that the middle is...

44
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:48,760
 See, this is where they're going to get shot in the foot that they're only 1.24 kilometres.

45
00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:53,760
 If they were a bit bigger, they might still be the centre, but this is a very small fraction out of them.

46
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:58,760
 Well, maybe there'll be a massive population boom of people flooding to the area, given this exciting news.

47
00:03:58,760 --> 00:04:05,760
 I love it, though. I love the competition between different centres because there is so much skull-duggery going on.

48
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:09,760
 So I'm sure you guys all found the place that was Rugby.

49
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:13,760
 Rugby also in North Dakota, so quite near centre, probably.

50
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:18,760
 They announced that they were the centre of North America in 1931.

51
00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:22,760
 And they put up a stone monument and they used to hold a...

52
00:04:22,760 --> 00:04:27,760
 They might even still hold a Miss Geographic Centre beauty pageant every year.

53
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:30,760
 And every September, they have a Geographic Centre Day,

54
00:04:30,760 --> 00:04:35,760
 which features a mechanical bull and a basketball tournament for reasons that are not immediately plain.

55
00:04:35,760 --> 00:04:40,760
 I think because they're both quite American things that Americans like to do, isn't it?

56
00:04:40,760 --> 00:04:47,760
 It'd be weird if they had a paella-making competition and a boomerang throwing competition.

57
00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:55,760
 So this place, Rugby, it could be that when they take into account the fact that the earth is shaped a little bit like a rugby ball,

58
00:04:55,760 --> 00:04:59,760
 that Rugby then becomes the centre of America. Would that be nice?

59
00:04:59,760 --> 00:05:01,760
 Yeah, I'd love that.

60
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:05,760
 Fingers crossed, calling on mathematicians to force that to be true.

61
00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:11,760
 So there's another place which is in North Dakota that also claimed to be the centre of North America called Robinson.

62
00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:15,760
 And it was the mayor who declared that it was the centre.

63
00:05:15,760 --> 00:05:21,760
 And specifically, a bar that he owns called Hansen's Bar was the absolute centre.

64
00:05:21,760 --> 00:05:26,760
 And quite nicely, he had this idea when he was drinking with his buddies in the bar,

65
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:30,760
 and his name is Bill Bender, which is a perfect going on a Bender drinking.

66
00:05:30,760 --> 00:05:33,760
 Yeah, paying the bill.

67
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:42,760
 So both of these two towns, Rugby and Robinson, are furious that it's been calculated that centre is in fact the centre.

68
00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:46,760
 Yeah, although you've got to be suspicious of the guy who was randomly drinking with his mates in a bar

69
00:05:46,760 --> 00:05:51,760
 and thought, let's try and work out where the centre of North America is, and it happened to be the bar they were drinking in.

70
00:05:51,760 --> 00:05:55,760
 It's his bar. This is a complete con designed to get people to build that bar.

71
00:05:55,760 --> 00:05:59,760
 No, it's infuriated because there was a big New York Times piece about it.

72
00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:02,760
 And the New York Times, because they're very diligent in fact checkers, they said,

73
00:06:02,760 --> 00:06:06,760
 how did you calculate that you are the exact centre of North America?

74
00:06:06,760 --> 00:06:11,760
 And his words were, it was trial and error. I can't give you an exact formula.

75
00:06:11,760 --> 00:06:15,760
 And then he said it was bar room science that they'd used.

76
00:06:15,760 --> 00:06:22,760
 And then when Rugby got involved, because Bill Bender registered his bar as the legal owner of the phrase,

77
00:06:22,760 --> 00:06:27,760
 geographical centre of North America, because Rugby had let it lapse in 2009 foolishly.

78
00:06:27,760 --> 00:06:30,760
 They took their eyes off the ball and Bill Bender grabbed it.

79
00:06:30,760 --> 00:06:34,760
 So when Rugby sent a legal letter to him, he offered to fight the mayor of Rugby.

80
00:06:34,760 --> 00:06:38,760
 I don't think he's not reputable enough to own the centre of North America, in my opinion.

81
00:06:38,760 --> 00:06:48,760
 I think it sounds like a wily businessman under your jealous that you haven't come up with any such idea to sell your various shows and products over the years.

82
00:06:48,760 --> 00:06:52,760
 By the way, I looked on Wikipedia of places in America called centre.

83
00:06:52,760 --> 00:06:58,760
 And there are over 15 actual towns and then there's places where no one lives that are called centre,

84
00:06:58,760 --> 00:07:06,760
 but roughly 15 places that are all called centre, all for the exact same reason that they claim to be the centre of Alabama or wherever it is that they are,

85
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:12,760
 all except one, which is centre in Georgia, which was actually named after a man called Mr Centre.

86
00:07:12,760 --> 00:07:14,760
 That's the only one.

87
00:07:14,760 --> 00:07:21,760
 It used to be that in America you would put your kind of county hall in exactly the middle of your county,

88
00:07:21,760 --> 00:07:24,760
 because they thought it was like more accessible.

89
00:07:24,760 --> 00:07:30,760
 Like for instance, if the parliament in the UK is in London, obviously the people in Scotland have to travel a long way to get there.

90
00:07:30,760 --> 00:07:35,760
 But if it was exactly in the middle of the country, the idea is it's more accessible for more people.

91
00:07:35,760 --> 00:07:39,760
 Yeah, I think that is sort of the only reason to work out where a centre is.

92
00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:45,760
 Isn't it to work out where to put your seat of government and then to satisfy weird facts lovers.

93
00:07:45,760 --> 00:07:50,760
 There is a problem with being in the centre of America, someone found out.

94
00:07:50,760 --> 00:07:56,760
 There's this massive problem that was generated for someone who lives quite near the centre of the US, in fact.

95
00:07:56,760 --> 00:07:59,760
 And this has to do with a company called MaxMind.

96
00:07:59,760 --> 00:08:01,760
 Have you read about this story about IP addresses?

97
00:08:01,760 --> 00:08:11,760
 So it's so weird. Basically MaxMind is this company who about just over 10 years ago started calculating the location of loads of IP addresses.

98
00:08:11,760 --> 00:08:13,760
 So you know with your computer you've got an IP address.

99
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:20,760
 MaxMind figured out whereabouts they all were geographically and then it could sell that information to companies like Google and Facebook and lots of other people.

100
00:08:20,760 --> 00:08:24,760
 But often when you're trying to work out where an IP address is, you can't get it exact.

101
00:08:24,760 --> 00:08:28,760
 And sometimes it'll just say this is somewhere in America or somewhere in the US.

102
00:08:28,760 --> 00:08:33,760
 And so for all of those, MaxMind just default assumed that they were in the middle.

103
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:37,760
 So they got the coordinates of roughly the middle of America and said,

104
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:41,760
 OK, all the IP addresses that we can't quite place, they just are here.

105
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:47,760
 And it turns out here is a rural farmhouse belonging to someone called Joyce Taylor,

106
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:52,760
 who now has 600 million IP addresses registered to her farmhouse.

107
00:08:52,760 --> 00:08:59,760
 And it's a complete disaster because basically if there's a troll online or if there's someone who's hacked your company

108
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:03,760
 or if there's someone doing criminal activity online and the police are tracking them down,

109
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:08,760
 they chase up their IP address and they constantly find it's at Joyce Taylor's farmhouse.

110
00:09:08,760 --> 00:09:14,760
 And she's just inundated with kind of abuse and people writing her threatening letters and had no idea why.

111
00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:20,760
 For about eight years she was just like, why am I being, what's happening to me until this journalist tracked her down?

112
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:25,760
 Are we definitely discounting the fact that Joyce is like a massive cyber criminal?

113
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:31,760
 She's a criminal mastermind, an 82-year-old criminal mastermind. It's possible.

114
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:34,760
 That's funny. Oh, poor Joyce.

115
00:09:34,760 --> 00:09:38,760
 They used to work out the middle of America by doing a cardboard cutout of the whole country

116
00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:41,760
 and then balancing it on their finger.

117
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:44,760
 And wherever it balanced, that's where the center was. Isn't that amazing?

118
00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:46,760
 It seems like, is it quite a good method?

119
00:09:46,760 --> 00:09:51,760
 Yeah, they got this, they got it accurate to within 20 miles of the current center.

120
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:59,760
 What do they do? I know that they use the exact same method for countries that have islands that sit around because they're obviously apart.

121
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:04,760
 Do they include, when they do the cardboard cutout, do they sort of just slam that onto the end or do they include the ocean bit?

122
00:10:04,760 --> 00:10:10,760
 That's difficult, isn't it? Because you couldn't just slam it onto the side because if it's further away from the pivot, it's going to be weighing more.

123
00:10:10,760 --> 00:10:14,760
 But then you can't attach it because then the thing you've attached it with weighs something.

124
00:10:14,760 --> 00:10:17,760
 So that actually sounds like it might be a slight flaw in the system.

125
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:23,760
 That's true. The UK, I looked up the Ordnance Survey website and found out how they calculate the center.

126
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:31,760
 And they actually said, they say on their website now, we calculate the center of Great Britain using the gravitational method.

127
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:34,760
 So that is the one you're talking about. That is the cardboard cutout.

128
00:10:34,760 --> 00:10:36,760
 Wow, really? That's the news, effectively, yeah.

129
00:10:36,760 --> 00:10:42,760
 Do they probably do like a simulation of a cardboard cutout using a massive supercomputer?

130
00:10:42,760 --> 00:10:46,760
 They don't go into detail, actually, which makes me think it's probably a cardboard cutout.

131
00:10:46,760 --> 00:10:49,760
 Where is the center of the UK? It's in Lancashire, isn't it?

132
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:53,760
 Yeah, it is. It's the forest of Boland.

133
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:57,760
 Oh, yeah. There's one claim that it's a place called Meridan.

134
00:10:57,760 --> 00:11:00,760
 Meridan, I think, is the center of England because I've been to Meridan.

135
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:02,760
 Oh, is the center of England, yes.

136
00:11:02,760 --> 00:11:09,760
 Forest of Boland, where my grandfather, I think, was born, is just in North... No, it's central Lancashire, I think.

137
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:14,760
 Right. But there is, in the Meridan one, there is a monument that stands there.

138
00:11:14,760 --> 00:11:17,760
 It's been there for 500 years. You can go and visit it.

139
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:19,760
 I have done that, of course. Have you? No way.

140
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:24,760
 Of course I have. I was once within 20 miles of the center of the UK with my long-suffering wife and said,

141
00:11:24,760 --> 00:11:28,760
 "Oh, like, I've just noticed somewhere I could take a photo."

142
00:11:28,760 --> 00:11:30,760
 And we drove that extra bit.

143
00:11:30,760 --> 00:11:32,760
 Wow. That's really funny.

144
00:11:32,760 --> 00:11:35,760
 James, have you been to the center of the EU?

145
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:37,760
 I don't know. Where is it?

146
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:41,760
 Oh, yeah. The odds are astronomical.

147
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:46,760
 But basically, there's a real problem with calculating the geographical center of the EU,

148
00:11:46,760 --> 00:11:50,760
 which is that the membership of the EU changes every few years.

149
00:11:50,760 --> 00:11:56,760
 So it used to be, in a particular place, then it changed in 1986 when Spain and Portugal joined.

150
00:11:56,760 --> 00:11:59,760
 Then in 1990, Germany was reunited and that shifted a little bit.

151
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:03,760
 And so it keeps moving. It's just moved again due to Brexit.

152
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:07,760
 And also, what did you do before Brexit? What did you do with the United Kingdom?

153
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:10,760
 Do you just sell a taper onto France or do you include the bit in between?

154
00:12:10,760 --> 00:12:12,760
 Right. I can't remember.

155
00:12:12,760 --> 00:12:15,760
 And in fact, I suspect I never bothered to find out.

156
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:18,760
 So where is the center then? Where is the current one, do you know?

157
00:12:18,760 --> 00:12:23,760
 Actually, I'm now looking at the one for Europe, which I think might be slightly different to the EU.

158
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:29,760
 But the one for Europe is in Lithuania and it's got five reviews on TripAdvisor.

159
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:35,760
 And they're all from James saying, "My wife was really pissed off."

160
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:37,760
 Sort of ruined the whole experience.

161
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:44,760
 The center of the EU, the new center is going to be, or is now, a field in Gadheim in Germany,

162
00:12:44,760 --> 00:12:50,760
 which has, they've already erected a red and white pole there and various flags flying all around it.

163
00:12:50,760 --> 00:12:52,760
 And in fact, they got really impatient.

164
00:12:52,760 --> 00:12:54,760
 There was an interview with, I think, the mayor of a nearby area saying,

165
00:12:54,760 --> 00:12:57,760
 "Because Britain took so long to figure out when it was leaving the EU,

166
00:12:57,760 --> 00:13:00,760
 and they're just desperate to announce themselves as the new middle."

167
00:13:00,760 --> 00:13:04,760
 They eventually erected a sign saying, "Future center of the EU."

168
00:13:04,760 --> 00:13:06,760
 Just to prepare people so it wasn't too much of a shock.

169
00:13:06,760 --> 00:13:09,760
 I was just thinking, right, bear with me.

170
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:15,760
 If you wanted to influence an election, say a Brexit election,

171
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:18,760
 then you might do a lot of online work.

172
00:13:18,760 --> 00:13:22,760
 So you might send a load of fake news and fake adverts and stuff like that.

173
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:28,760
 And what would you need? You would need to find a lot of IP addresses to send all these things.

174
00:13:28,760 --> 00:13:32,760
 And who would have all those IP addresses, someone in the center of Europe,

175
00:13:32,760 --> 00:13:37,760
 and who has the motivation to want Brexit, the people who are in the center of Europe?

176
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:43,760
 So you're saying it's the farmers of Gadheim who have clubbed together and swung the election for Brexit.

177
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:44,760
 Exactly what I'm saying.

178
00:13:44,760 --> 00:13:48,760
 It's possible. That would be a great crime thriller.

179
00:13:48,760 --> 00:13:51,760
 I don't know if it would. I don't know if that's getting made.

180
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:55,760
 They'll get the tourist boost, though. That's what they count on.

181
00:13:55,760 --> 00:13:57,760
 They think they'll be flooded.

182
00:13:57,760 --> 00:14:00,760
 But the warning comes from the previous center that's now been deposed,

183
00:14:00,760 --> 00:14:05,760
 which was somewhere else called Festingrand, where the local baker there said,

184
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:09,760
 "We thought Chinese buses would be coming there every week when we became the center."

185
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:12,760
 It didn't really turn out that way.

186
00:14:12,760 --> 00:14:18,760
 James, have you and Polina been to the center of the world?

187
00:14:18,760 --> 00:14:21,760
 Where is it? Is it in Russia?

188
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:22,760
 It's in Ohio.

189
00:14:22,760 --> 00:14:24,760
 Oh, no. I haven't been to Ohio.

190
00:14:24,760 --> 00:14:25,760
 In America. What's that done?

191
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:32,760
 Center of the world. It was set up by a sort of eccentric businessman called Randall Wilmot in 1845.

192
00:14:32,760 --> 00:14:34,760
 It's when he first moved to this area.

193
00:14:34,760 --> 00:14:36,760
 And he set up a business there.

194
00:14:36,760 --> 00:14:38,760
 He settled there. Some houses were built.

195
00:14:38,760 --> 00:14:42,760
 And he thought to get the attraction of people and give it a name.

196
00:14:42,760 --> 00:14:47,760
 He called it the center of the world, which I believe it's still called to this day.

197
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:50,760
 And he just seems like a really fun character.

198
00:14:50,760 --> 00:14:56,760
 Before doing that, he lived in New York, where he had an establishment called the beginning of the world.

199
00:14:56,760 --> 00:15:00,760
 So when he left the beginning of the world, he went to the center of the world.

200
00:15:00,760 --> 00:15:03,760
 And he was there for a very long time.

201
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:09,760
 And then eventually business dried up and he moved 13 miles away to Cortland in Ohio,

202
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:13,760
 where he set up a grocery store called The End of the World.

203
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:17,760
 And that was the last thing, major thing that he did.

204
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:21,760
 So it's a guy who had in three places, the beginning, center and end of the world.

205
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:25,760
 So he's saying that the end of the world is only 13 miles from the middle of the world.

206
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:26,760
 Yes.

207
00:15:26,760 --> 00:15:31,760
 I don't know if those mathematical calculations are rigorous, as the previous ones.

208
00:15:31,760 --> 00:15:36,760
 This guy sounds like a distant ancestor of Bill Bender, I have to say.

209
00:15:36,760 --> 00:15:39,760
 Actually, you know what the roundest country on the planet is?

210
00:15:39,760 --> 00:15:40,760
 The roundest country on the planet.

211
00:15:40,760 --> 00:15:42,760
 I do know that. Is it Ivory Coast or something?

212
00:15:42,760 --> 00:15:44,760
 I don't think you do know.

213
00:15:44,760 --> 00:15:46,760
 Is it somewhere in Africa?

214
00:15:46,760 --> 00:15:49,760
 It's not Cote d'Ivoire, no. It's somewhere in Australia.

215
00:15:49,760 --> 00:15:50,760
 Oh, so close.

216
00:15:50,760 --> 00:15:52,760
 You were so close, isn't it?

217
00:15:52,760 --> 00:15:54,760
 So there are various different ways of working it out.

218
00:15:54,760 --> 00:15:56,760
 You can define rectangularity as well,

219
00:15:56,760 --> 00:15:59,760
 which is how much of a country overlaps with a rectangle of the same area.

220
00:15:59,760 --> 00:16:03,760
 And you might be able to get this one, the most rectangular country on the planet.

221
00:16:03,760 --> 00:16:07,760
 It's very rectangular. That's your clue.

222
00:16:07,760 --> 00:16:09,760
 Is it somewhere like Libya?

223
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:11,760
 Oh, you're so close.

224
00:16:11,760 --> 00:16:12,760
 In that case, Egypt.

225
00:16:12,760 --> 00:16:14,760
 Yes, Egypt.

226
00:16:14,760 --> 00:16:16,760
 Oh, with the pyramids. That's amazing.

227
00:16:16,760 --> 00:16:17,760
 Me.

228
00:16:17,760 --> 00:16:18,760
 Yeah.

229
00:16:18,760 --> 00:16:22,760
 Well, no, it's just amazing that the sort of national shape that we know it

230
00:16:22,760 --> 00:16:23,760
 is the actual shape of the country.

231
00:16:23,760 --> 00:16:27,760
 Well, no, because the pyramids are more triangular than square, aren't they?

232
00:16:27,760 --> 00:16:30,760
 Dan, have you seen only half-built pyramids?

233
00:16:30,760 --> 00:16:32,760
 You're talking about ziggalaxes.

234
00:16:32,760 --> 00:16:34,760
 No, I thought we said...

235
00:16:34,760 --> 00:16:35,760
 Oh, what did you say?

236
00:16:35,760 --> 00:16:36,760
 You said rectangular.

237
00:16:36,760 --> 00:16:37,760
 I did.

238
00:16:37,760 --> 00:16:38,760
 Cool.

239
00:16:38,760 --> 00:16:39,760
 Nice.

240
00:16:39,760 --> 00:16:41,760
 It just sounds very similar to triangle, doesn't it?

241
00:16:41,760 --> 00:16:42,760
 It does.

242
00:16:42,760 --> 00:16:43,760
 They're very similar.

243
00:16:43,760 --> 00:16:44,760
 They're all the same, don't they?

244
00:16:44,760 --> 00:16:45,760
 Yeah.

245
00:16:45,760 --> 00:16:49,760
 It's amazing those primary school kids managed to gather this at all.

246
00:16:49,760 --> 00:16:55,760
 So, any chance the most triangular country is Egypt?

247
00:16:55,760 --> 00:16:56,760
 You've got the answer.

248
00:16:56,760 --> 00:16:57,760
 We'll look into it.

249
00:16:57,760 --> 00:16:58,760
 I'll get back to you guys.

250
00:16:58,760 --> 00:17:06,760
 OK, it's time for fact number two, and that is James.

251
00:17:06,760 --> 00:17:10,760
 OK, my fact this week is that the modern door handle was invented

252
00:17:10,760 --> 00:17:12,760
 by Ludwig Wittgenstein.

253
00:17:12,760 --> 00:17:13,760
 No.

254
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:15,760
 It's my favourite fact ever.

255
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:16,760
 I love it.

256
00:17:16,760 --> 00:17:17,760
 That's incredible.

257
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:19,760
 I mean, he was quite recent.

258
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:21,760
 Yeah, he was more recent than doors.

259
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:22,760
 Yeah.

260
00:17:22,760 --> 00:17:25,760
 I thought no one could get through doors until he gave a lug.

261
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:27,760
 They were just walls.

262
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:29,760
 Just empty houses.

263
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:32,760
 When you say the modern door handle, this is what fascinates me,

264
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:36,760
 because it's as though there was a kind of archaic bad door handle,

265
00:17:36,760 --> 00:17:38,760
 and then he fixed it.

266
00:17:38,760 --> 00:17:40,760
 Well, that's kind of what happened.

267
00:17:40,760 --> 00:17:45,760
 So, Wittgenstein, philosopher, mid-20th century,

268
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:49,760
 very well-renowned pupil of Bertrand Russell,

269
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:52,760
 and kind of influenced pretty much everyone who came after him,

270
00:17:52,760 --> 00:17:56,760
 but also inventor of door handles.

271
00:17:56,760 --> 00:18:00,760
 Because I read this in an article about door handles

272
00:18:00,760 --> 00:18:02,760
 in Apollo Art Magazine.

273
00:18:02,760 --> 00:18:05,760
 And Wittgenstein was working as a school teacher,

274
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:09,760
 and he'd hit one of the kids because they'd upset him.

275
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:12,760
 And he'd had to kind of be taken out of the school

276
00:18:12,760 --> 00:18:14,760
 and be suspended and stuff like that.

277
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:16,760
 I think he got fired, actually.

278
00:18:16,760 --> 00:18:19,760
 And so he kind of was sat around feeling sorry for himself,

279
00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:21,760
 didn't have anything to do,

280
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:23,760
 but he came from an extremely rich family,

281
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:26,760
 and his sister Gretel decided to distract him from everything

282
00:18:26,760 --> 00:18:29,760
 by commissioning him to design the interior of a new house

283
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:31,760
 that she bought.

284
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:33,760
 And he was extremely distracted by this

285
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:37,760
 because it took him a year to design the door handle alone.

286
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:40,760
 It took him two years to design the radiators.

287
00:18:40,760 --> 00:18:44,760
 But what he came up with was a really modern kind of,

288
00:18:44,760 --> 00:18:47,760
 I want to say, like minimalistic kind of design of a house.

289
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:52,760
 And the door handle which he invented was kind of short,

290
00:18:52,760 --> 00:18:53,760
 coming out of the door,

291
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:57,760
 and then a long, straight bit with a little kink in it.

292
00:18:57,760 --> 00:18:59,760
 If that's, it's not a great explanation,

293
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:02,760
 but that's basically, if you look at a door handle now,

294
00:19:02,760 --> 00:19:04,760
 most of them will be that kind of design.

295
00:19:04,760 --> 00:19:07,760
 And until then it was more kind of knobs

296
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:09,760
 or it was straight handles or stuff like that.

297
00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:13,760
 So all future door handles were kind of influenced by this one

298
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:15,760
 that was invented by Wittgenstein.

299
00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:19,760
 In much the same way as all future philosophical thought

300
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:21,760
 was influenced by him too.

301
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:23,760
 I wonder how much that was seen.

302
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:25,760
 You know, like he probably was asked to do a lot of talks

303
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:27,760
 in the way that we have like Ted talks now.

304
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:30,760
 And he'd always email back or write back at the time going,

305
00:19:30,760 --> 00:19:32,760
 do you want the philosophical chat

306
00:19:32,760 --> 00:19:35,760
 or the door handle lecture?

307
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:36,760
 I've got both ready.

308
00:19:36,760 --> 00:19:38,760
 I think it was probably he'd be giving a talk

309
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:40,760
 and there'd be questions and answers at the end.

310
00:19:40,760 --> 00:19:42,760
 And everyone only wanted to ask about the door handle.

311
00:19:42,760 --> 00:19:45,760
 I bet every time he'd be like, come on guys,

312
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:47,760
 talk to your own philosophies.

313
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:51,760
 It sounds really different to the house you grew up in.

314
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:53,760
 So as James said, it's a very minimalist place,

315
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:55,760
 this place in Vienna.

316
00:19:55,760 --> 00:19:57,760
 But the house he grew up in was, he grew up in a palace.

317
00:19:57,760 --> 00:19:59,760
 This was how wealthy his family were.

318
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:02,760
 So the forecourt had sculptures in it by Rodin.

319
00:20:02,760 --> 00:20:04,760
 And there was someone who was employed in the house

320
00:20:04,760 --> 00:20:07,760
 for the sole purpose of bowing to visitors.

321
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:09,760
 That's what I read, sole purpose.

322
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:10,760
 Wow.

323
00:20:10,760 --> 00:20:11,760
 I know.

324
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:13,760
 They had seven pianos this house.

325
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:17,760
 It had an organ built in, had a fountain inside it.

326
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:18,760
 Wow.

327
00:20:18,760 --> 00:20:20,760
 They did have, I think they had the largest private fortune

328
00:20:20,760 --> 00:20:21,760
 in Europe possibly.

329
00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:22,760
 He didn't know the Wittgensteins.

330
00:20:22,760 --> 00:20:23,760
 Wow.

331
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:24,760
 Really?

332
00:20:24,760 --> 00:20:25,760
 They were loaded.

333
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:26,760
 Yeah.

334
00:20:26,760 --> 00:20:27,760
 So he was really trying to simplify

335
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:28,760
 when he designed this new house,

336
00:20:28,760 --> 00:20:31,760
 against the kind of incredibly opulent Viennese style.

337
00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:32,760
 Yeah.

338
00:20:32,760 --> 00:20:34,760
 I never thought of it that way about his previous house,

339
00:20:34,760 --> 00:20:36,760
 because when he moved to Trinity College,

340
00:20:36,760 --> 00:20:38,760
 after he became a famous philosopher,

341
00:20:38,760 --> 00:20:41,760
 his rooms were completely devoid of furniture.

342
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:42,760
 He had no furniture in them.

343
00:20:42,760 --> 00:20:44,760
 And when he left Cambridge,

344
00:20:44,760 --> 00:20:47,760
 he became an assistant gardener at an Austrian monastery

345
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:49,760
 and slept in a potting shed.

346
00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:53,760
 So maybe he was just trying to escape from that opulence.

347
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:54,760
 Yeah.

348
00:20:54,760 --> 00:20:55,760
 Like I said.

349
00:20:55,760 --> 00:20:57,760
 Well, he gave all his money away as well, didn't he?

350
00:20:57,760 --> 00:20:58,760
 Yeah.

351
00:20:58,760 --> 00:20:59,760
 He inherited a lot,

352
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:01,760
 and he just gave it to his brother's and sister.

353
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:04,760
 And should have given it to the kid he was hitting at school,

354
00:21:04,760 --> 00:21:06,760
 which got him sacked from the job.

355
00:21:06,760 --> 00:21:08,760
 Well, to be honest, later on,

356
00:21:08,760 --> 00:21:13,760
 when he kind of had a bit of severe introspection after the war,

357
00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:15,760
 he kind of went to live in Norway,

358
00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:17,760
 and he did a lot of confessions.

359
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:20,760
 So anything that happened to him previously in life,

360
00:21:20,760 --> 00:21:21,760
 which he felt bad about,

361
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:24,760
 he went to those people and apologized for those things.

362
00:21:24,760 --> 00:21:27,760
 And he apologized to this,

363
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:30,760
 at least to one of the children whose ears he had polled.

364
00:21:30,760 --> 00:21:31,760
 Did he?

365
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:32,760
 Yeah.

366
00:21:32,760 --> 00:21:33,760
 She was called.

367
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:35,760
 He was the original "My Name Is Earl".

368
00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:36,760
 Is that what that is?

369
00:21:36,760 --> 00:21:37,760
 Oh, yeah.

370
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:39,760
 Yeah, you guys remember "My Name Is Earl", right?

371
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:40,760
 No.

372
00:21:40,760 --> 00:21:42,760
 Is that TV series about that guy who committed loads of crimes

373
00:21:42,760 --> 00:21:44,760
 and then spent his life going back apologizing to them?

374
00:21:44,760 --> 00:21:46,760
 Well, it sounds like that's exactly what victims are.

375
00:21:46,760 --> 00:21:48,760
 I think it's based on this.

376
00:21:48,760 --> 00:21:50,760
 Sounds like "My Name Is Ludwig Wittgenstein".

377
00:21:50,760 --> 00:21:52,760
 And "My Father Is An Earl".

378
00:21:52,760 --> 00:21:57,760
 One of the reasons he became a teacher

379
00:21:57,760 --> 00:22:00,760
 was that he essentially gave up on philosophy, didn't he?

380
00:22:00,760 --> 00:22:05,760
 He wrote this thing called Tractatus logico philosophicus,

381
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:08,760
 and it's a series of numbered bullet points.

382
00:22:08,760 --> 00:22:09,760
 It's not a...

383
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:11,760
 Well, it's a tough read, I would say.

384
00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:12,760
 It's a dense read.

385
00:22:12,760 --> 00:22:13,760
 Tried to get through some of it.

386
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:15,760
 He was very a man after our own hearts

387
00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:17,760
 because it opened with things like,

388
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:19,760
 "The world divides into facts.

389
00:22:19,760 --> 00:22:21,760
 "The world is the totality of facts.

390
00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:23,760
 "The world is determined by facts.

391
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:25,760
 "The facts in logical space are the world."

392
00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:27,760
 He sort of should be our mascot.

393
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:28,760
 Wow.

394
00:22:28,760 --> 00:22:30,760
 But then he wrote this thing

395
00:22:30,760 --> 00:22:32,760
 with some impenetrable bullet points in it.

396
00:22:32,760 --> 00:22:34,760
 And then he believed that Tractatus had cleared up

397
00:22:34,760 --> 00:22:36,760
 all the confusions that had tormented philosophy

398
00:22:36,760 --> 00:22:37,760
 until that point.

399
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:39,760
 And so he decided it was never necessary to write again.

400
00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:41,760
 And that was when he disappeared off to the Elps

401
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:42,760
 after the First World War.

402
00:22:42,760 --> 00:22:44,760
 He's like, "I've solved philosophy

403
00:22:44,760 --> 00:22:47,760
 "now about these doors."

404
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:49,760
 You're welcome.

405
00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:51,760
 Although then he decided against that

406
00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:53,760
 and I think went back to it by 1929

407
00:22:53,760 --> 00:22:55,760
 and wrote his other great work.

408
00:22:55,760 --> 00:22:58,760
 So he initially studied at Cambridge,

409
00:22:58,760 --> 00:23:00,760
 as James said, under Bertrand Russell.

410
00:23:00,760 --> 00:23:03,760
 And when he arrived there,

411
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:06,760
 he seemed like a bit of a cocky dick

412
00:23:06,760 --> 00:23:08,760
 when it came to philosophies.

413
00:23:08,760 --> 00:23:11,760
 Like, as in, I'm surprised Russell didn't go,

414
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:13,760
 "Get out of here," at some of the stuff he did.

415
00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:16,760
 I read an obituary that Russell wrote about him

416
00:23:16,760 --> 00:23:18,760
 and he describes his first encounter

417
00:23:18,760 --> 00:23:20,760
 and he says, "He maintained, for example,

418
00:23:20,760 --> 00:23:22,760
 "at one time that all existential propositions

419
00:23:22,760 --> 00:23:23,760
 "are meaningless.

420
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:24,760
 "This was in a lecture room

421
00:23:24,760 --> 00:23:26,760
 "and I invited him to consider the proposition

422
00:23:26,760 --> 00:23:29,760
 "there is no hippopotamus in this room at present.

423
00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:31,760
 "When he refused to believe this,

424
00:23:31,760 --> 00:23:33,760
 "I looked under all the desks without finding one

425
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:35,760
 "but he remained unconvinced."

426
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:37,760
 I mean, if I tried to pull that on you guys,

427
00:23:37,760 --> 00:23:39,760
 you'd kick me out of the room, right?

428
00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:40,760
 It's true. Like, it was...

429
00:23:40,760 --> 00:23:42,760
 Do you remember that time you tried to convince us

430
00:23:42,760 --> 00:23:44,760
 that rectangles and rectangles were the same thing?

431
00:23:44,760 --> 00:23:49,760
 Oh, that's true. I've still got a job.

432
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:51,760
 Yeah, maybe.

433
00:23:51,760 --> 00:23:55,760
 Isn't there a story about Vic Constine and Russell?

434
00:23:55,760 --> 00:23:56,760
 I might be wrong about this

435
00:23:56,760 --> 00:23:57,760
 because I haven't written it down,

436
00:23:57,760 --> 00:23:59,760
 but did he not go to Cambridge

437
00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:01,760
 and Russell said,

438
00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:03,760
 "Tell me why I should take you on as a student,"

439
00:24:03,760 --> 00:24:05,760
 and he gave him a piece of paper

440
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:08,760
 with one sentence or one word written on it or something

441
00:24:08,760 --> 00:24:10,760
 and Russell looked at it

442
00:24:10,760 --> 00:24:12,760
 and then kind of threw it away

443
00:24:12,760 --> 00:24:14,760
 but gave him the job based on that,

444
00:24:14,760 --> 00:24:16,760
 and no one knows what was on that piece of paper.

445
00:24:16,760 --> 00:24:18,760
 I think that's true. Wow.

446
00:24:18,760 --> 00:24:20,760
 That's the story, yeah.

447
00:24:20,760 --> 00:24:23,760
 It's probably a drawing of a door handle or something.

448
00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:27,760
 Yeah, that is the story.

449
00:24:27,760 --> 00:24:29,760
 I don't know if it's apocryphal, but...

450
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:30,760
 It sounds it, does it? Yeah.

451
00:24:30,760 --> 00:24:32,760
 He had such a full life.

452
00:24:32,760 --> 00:24:34,760
 It's amazing. I mean, he fought in the First World War,

453
00:24:34,760 --> 00:24:35,760
 which we haven't even mentioned,

454
00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:38,760
 as, I guess, loads of men of that age had done.

455
00:24:38,760 --> 00:24:42,760
 He also had been an engineer before being a philosopher,

456
00:24:42,760 --> 00:24:45,760
 so he built an aeronautical engine,

457
00:24:45,760 --> 00:24:47,760
 which actually proved useful

458
00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:49,760
 when helicopters were being designed later on.

459
00:24:49,760 --> 00:24:52,760
 And so this is a really, really, really full life he had.

460
00:24:52,760 --> 00:24:54,760
 Yeah, and he was a genius,

461
00:24:54,760 --> 00:24:56,760
 but he's basically the philosopher's philosopher, isn't he?

462
00:24:56,760 --> 00:24:57,760
 Like all other philosophers said,

463
00:24:57,760 --> 00:24:59,760
 "This is the smartest guy you've ever met, guys."

464
00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:02,760
 So maybe he was justified in that arrogance,

465
00:25:02,760 --> 00:25:05,760
 but in his lectures, he used to throw students out

466
00:25:05,760 --> 00:25:08,760
 when they didn't insult him, basically.

467
00:25:08,760 --> 00:25:11,760
 So if students didn't ask him pertinent questions

468
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:13,760
 or lay into him about his arguments,

469
00:25:13,760 --> 00:25:14,760
 he'd kick them out of the lectures,

470
00:25:14,760 --> 00:25:16,760
 and at one point, there was just one person

471
00:25:16,760 --> 00:25:17,760
 left in his lecture at the inn,

472
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:18,760
 because he'd kicked everyone else out

473
00:25:18,760 --> 00:25:20,760
 for being too stupid and accepting.

474
00:25:20,760 --> 00:25:21,760
 Wow.

475
00:25:21,760 --> 00:25:23,760
 And that was actually a guy called Francis Skinner,

476
00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:27,760
 with whom he planned to emigrate to the Soviet Union in 1934.

477
00:25:27,760 --> 00:25:29,760
 He wanted to become a manual laborer.

478
00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:30,760
 What?

479
00:25:30,760 --> 00:25:32,760
 And he, in fact, visited the Soviet Union

480
00:25:32,760 --> 00:25:34,760
 to kind of do a recce of it and be like,

481
00:25:34,760 --> 00:25:36,760
 "Is this place good for manual labor?"

482
00:25:36,760 --> 00:25:38,760
 And he came back and decided against it.

483
00:25:38,760 --> 00:25:39,760
 Very well.

484
00:25:39,760 --> 00:25:41,760
 As I think you would if you were considering manual labor

485
00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:43,760
 in the USSR in 1934.

486
00:25:43,760 --> 00:25:45,760
 There's another reason why he was a man

487
00:25:45,760 --> 00:25:47,760
 after our own hearts, I think,

488
00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:50,760
 because one of his famous things that he wrote was,

489
00:25:50,760 --> 00:25:51,760
 "If a lion could speak,

490
00:25:51,760 --> 00:25:53,760
 we would not be able to understand him."

491
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:55,760
 And what he means by that, basically,

492
00:25:55,760 --> 00:25:58,760
 is that you can translate one human language

493
00:25:58,760 --> 00:26:00,760
 to another human language, and that's fine,

494
00:26:00,760 --> 00:26:02,760
 because we've all had the same kind of life.

495
00:26:02,760 --> 00:26:04,760
 We all have the same experiences.

496
00:26:04,760 --> 00:26:06,760
 We all feel the same. We all smell the same.

497
00:26:06,760 --> 00:26:07,760
 We all see the same.

498
00:26:07,760 --> 00:26:10,760
 And so it's easy to translate those words to other words.

499
00:26:10,760 --> 00:26:14,760
 But with lions, we just do not know what it's like being a lion.

500
00:26:14,760 --> 00:26:16,760
 And if they could tell us stuff,

501
00:26:16,760 --> 00:26:18,760
 we just wouldn't understand the single thing they were saying.

502
00:26:18,760 --> 00:26:20,760
 And it was a point he was making about language.

503
00:26:20,760 --> 00:26:22,760
 But it's the point that I always make,

504
00:26:22,760 --> 00:26:24,760
 that a lion doesn't even know it's a lion.

505
00:26:24,760 --> 00:26:26,760
 Don't try and pass yourself off

506
00:26:26,760 --> 00:26:28,760
 with the heir to the great philosophy of the 20th century.

507
00:26:28,760 --> 00:26:30,760
 We see you.

508
00:26:30,760 --> 00:26:34,760
 Can we talk a bit about his family as well?

509
00:26:34,760 --> 00:26:36,760
 So I'm sure you guys came across this book,

510
00:26:36,760 --> 00:26:38,760
 "The House of Wittgenstein,"

511
00:26:38,760 --> 00:26:41,760
 which is a book about the entire clan.

512
00:26:41,760 --> 00:26:43,760
 And it sounds insane.

513
00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:46,760
 I mean, the book sounds remarkable, but the family also,

514
00:26:46,760 --> 00:26:48,760
 they were dreadfully unhappy as people.

515
00:26:48,760 --> 00:26:50,760
 So he was one of five brothers,

516
00:26:50,760 --> 00:26:52,760
 three of whom took their own lives,

517
00:26:52,760 --> 00:26:54,760
 and the other two of whom seriously considered it.

518
00:26:54,760 --> 00:26:58,760
 So the two brothers who didn't were Ludwig and Paul.

519
00:26:58,760 --> 00:27:01,760
 And Paul was an amazing...

520
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:05,760
 He was a pianist who lost an arm during the First World War,

521
00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:09,760
 but stayed as a pianist, a one-armed pianist.

522
00:27:09,760 --> 00:27:13,760
 And he commissioned one-handed works from lots and lots of composers.

523
00:27:13,760 --> 00:27:16,760
 So Strauss, Prokofiev, Britton, Ravel,

524
00:27:16,760 --> 00:27:18,760
 which could have been a really nice tool

525
00:27:18,760 --> 00:27:20,760
 for other pianists with one arm.

526
00:27:20,760 --> 00:27:24,760
 But he declined permission to other one-armed pianists

527
00:27:24,760 --> 00:27:26,760
 to actually play the pieces.

528
00:27:26,760 --> 00:27:28,760
 This is the worst thing.

529
00:27:28,760 --> 00:27:30,760
 Even if he couldn't play them himself,

530
00:27:30,760 --> 00:27:32,760
 because he found them difficult,

531
00:27:32,760 --> 00:27:34,760
 he would not let other people have a go.

532
00:27:34,760 --> 00:27:36,760
 He wrote back to Prokofiev,

533
00:27:36,760 --> 00:27:38,760
 "Thank you for your concerto,

534
00:27:38,760 --> 00:27:40,760
 but I do not understand a single note,

535
00:27:40,760 --> 00:27:42,760
 and I shall not play it."

536
00:27:42,760 --> 00:27:45,760
 But he was, because they came from a rich family,

537
00:27:45,760 --> 00:27:47,760
 they were all kind of spoiled brats in a way,

538
00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:49,760
 except Wittgenstein, who it seems eschewed all that.

539
00:27:49,760 --> 00:27:52,760
 So Paul eventually had to flee to America

540
00:27:52,760 --> 00:27:54,760
 because he had impregnated this woman

541
00:27:54,760 --> 00:27:56,760
 who had a piano lesson, in fact, that he was giving her.

542
00:27:56,760 --> 00:27:58,760
 And so he fled to America.

543
00:27:58,760 --> 00:28:00,760
 Sorry, during the first piano lesson, he got her pregnant.

544
00:28:00,760 --> 00:28:02,760
 He should have been just practicing his fingering.

545
00:28:02,760 --> 00:28:04,760
 [LAUGHS]

546
00:28:04,760 --> 00:28:10,760
 So he played the piano differently then.

547
00:28:10,760 --> 00:28:12,760
 I had so many piano lessons.

548
00:28:12,760 --> 00:28:14,760
 I mean, not once did you get pregnant.

549
00:28:14,760 --> 00:28:16,760
 I didn't.

550
00:28:16,760 --> 00:28:20,760
 So he impregnated this student, fled to America,

551
00:28:20,760 --> 00:28:23,760
 and he didn't have a valid once he was in America,

552
00:28:23,760 --> 00:28:25,760
 which he wasn't used to, he didn't know how to live without that.

553
00:28:25,760 --> 00:28:27,760
 So, for instance, he was staying in a hotel,

554
00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:29,760
 and he just took off all his clothes

555
00:28:29,760 --> 00:28:31,760
 and left them outside the door of the hotel,

556
00:28:31,760 --> 00:28:33,760
 assuming that a valid would come and wash them

557
00:28:33,760 --> 00:28:35,760
 and return them to him, and they all got stolen.

558
00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:37,760
 And so...

559
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:39,760
 Wait, surely outside the door of his room,

560
00:28:39,760 --> 00:28:41,760
 not outside the door of the hotel.

561
00:28:41,760 --> 00:28:43,760
 It's also outside the door of his room.

562
00:28:43,760 --> 00:28:45,760
 Can I also say, if he decided he wanted to get his clothes

563
00:28:45,760 --> 00:28:47,760
 washed by a hotel every single time,

564
00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:50,760
 then he would have lost the entire family fortune,

565
00:28:50,760 --> 00:28:53,760
 within about three weeks, if your experience is anything to go by.

566
00:28:53,760 --> 00:28:56,760
 Yeah, look, let's not revisit my hotel bill

567
00:28:56,760 --> 00:28:58,760
 from our US tour last year.

568
00:28:58,760 --> 00:29:01,760
 It is a great way to lose your entire family fortune.

569
00:29:01,760 --> 00:29:03,760
 So reason the tour lost money.

570
00:29:03,760 --> 00:29:08,760
 But he sat around wearing bedsheets.

571
00:29:08,760 --> 00:29:10,760
 He just wore a sheet over himself

572
00:29:10,760 --> 00:29:12,760
 until someone eventually sort of heard about it

573
00:29:12,760 --> 00:29:14,760
 and said, "Shot me to be your PA,

574
00:29:14,760 --> 00:29:16,760
 'cause it seems you don't know how to live in the world."

575
00:29:16,760 --> 00:29:18,760
 And she was hired.

576
00:29:18,760 --> 00:29:20,760
 And there was another anecdote about him

577
00:29:20,760 --> 00:29:22,760
 walking out into the street and someone had given him a hat.

578
00:29:22,760 --> 00:29:24,760
 And he was wearing the hat,

579
00:29:24,760 --> 00:29:26,760
 but it was still attached to its hat box.

580
00:29:26,760 --> 00:29:28,760
 'Cause he didn't know,

581
00:29:28,760 --> 00:29:30,760
 I guess, how to put on his own hat?

582
00:29:30,760 --> 00:29:32,760
 Wow, that is posh.

583
00:29:32,760 --> 00:29:34,760
 What about Gretel, we mentioned her earlier,

584
00:29:34,760 --> 00:29:36,760
 who was the person who bought the house

585
00:29:36,760 --> 00:29:38,760
 which Wittgenstein designed?

586
00:29:38,760 --> 00:29:41,760
 She found it by following a trail of sweets to the door, didn't she?

587
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:47,760
 So Gretel was the subject of a portrait by Gustav Klimt,

588
00:29:47,760 --> 00:29:49,760
 and, you know, Klimt

589
00:29:49,760 --> 00:29:51,760
 one of the greatest artists of the early 20th century,

590
00:29:51,760 --> 00:29:53,760
 but she just hated it,

591
00:29:53,760 --> 00:29:55,760
 and so she just kept it in her attic.

592
00:29:55,760 --> 00:29:57,760
 I mean, you know,

593
00:29:57,760 --> 00:29:59,760
 fancy having your portrait drawn by Klimt

594
00:29:59,760 --> 00:30:01,760
 and then just thinking, "I don't like it very much."

595
00:30:01,760 --> 00:30:03,760
 Have we, is it out of the attic yet?

596
00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:05,760
 Do we know what it's like?

597
00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:07,760
 Maybe he was having a really bad day.

598
00:30:07,760 --> 00:30:09,760
 No, it's good, I think it's good.

599
00:30:09,760 --> 00:30:11,760
 I mean, she has quite a long neck in it, but...

600
00:30:11,760 --> 00:30:13,760
 That might be.

601
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:15,760
 Not the Diddlyani long,

602
00:30:15,760 --> 00:30:17,760
 just like it's slightly longer than a normal person's neck.

603
00:30:17,760 --> 00:30:19,760
 She's still fitting into...

604
00:30:19,760 --> 00:30:21,760
 onto the canvas, right?

605
00:30:21,760 --> 00:30:23,760
 It's not such a long neck.

606
00:30:23,760 --> 00:30:25,760
 She had to chop off the top of her head.

607
00:30:25,760 --> 00:30:27,760
 She had to chop off the hat box at the top.

608
00:30:27,760 --> 00:30:31,760
 She wasn't very nice, I don't think.

609
00:30:31,760 --> 00:30:33,760
 Well, she was a bit of a Nazi, wasn't she?

610
00:30:33,760 --> 00:30:35,760
 In fact, both the sisters were a bit...

611
00:30:35,760 --> 00:30:37,760
 had Nazi tendencies, and in fact,

612
00:30:37,760 --> 00:30:39,760
 sided with the fascists against Paul

613
00:30:39,760 --> 00:30:41,760
 and gave away a lot of their fortune to the Nazis.

614
00:30:41,760 --> 00:30:43,760
 And they all kind of hated each other, the siblings.

615
00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:45,760
 They ended up variously estranged from each other,

616
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:47,760
 as well as all sort of committing suicide.

617
00:30:47,760 --> 00:30:49,760
 It's a very sad family.

618
00:30:49,760 --> 00:30:51,760
 There was a lot of, obviously,

619
00:30:51,760 --> 00:30:53,760
 there was a lot of Nazism about at the time.

620
00:30:53,760 --> 00:30:55,760
 Ludwig was actually a classmate of Adolf Hitler's.

621
00:30:55,760 --> 00:30:57,760
 No. Yeah.

622
00:30:57,760 --> 00:30:59,760
 Was he? Wow. He was.

623
00:30:59,760 --> 00:31:01,760
 They were at the same age and they were at the same school,

624
00:31:01,760 --> 00:31:03,760
 but Wittgenstein was put forward a year

625
00:31:03,760 --> 00:31:05,760
 and Hitler was taken back a year.

626
00:31:05,760 --> 00:31:07,760
 Dodged a bullet.

627
00:31:07,760 --> 00:31:09,760
 So... Hitler was taken back a year?

628
00:31:09,760 --> 00:31:11,760
 Yeah, yeah. Oh, wow.

629
00:31:11,760 --> 00:31:13,760
 So they ended up two years apart.

630
00:31:13,760 --> 00:31:15,760
 Yeah, exactly, even though they're the same age.

631
00:31:15,760 --> 00:31:17,760
 So they probably wouldn't have known each other.

632
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:19,760
 No, they knew each other. It was a small school.

633
00:31:19,760 --> 00:31:21,760
 Small schools. Oh, OK. That was embarrassing for Hitler.

634
00:31:21,760 --> 00:31:23,760
 That's like Dom Jollien or Summer bin Laden.

635
00:31:23,760 --> 00:31:25,760
 Yeah. They were at the same school.

636
00:31:25,760 --> 00:31:27,760
 Dom Jollien and Summer bin Laden went to the same school.

637
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:29,760
 Yeah, they went to the same school.

638
00:31:29,760 --> 00:31:31,760
 I can see that you're kind of putting Osama bin Laden

639
00:31:31,760 --> 00:31:33,760
 and Hitler in the same bracket,

640
00:31:33,760 --> 00:31:35,760
 but Dom Jollien, Ludwig Wittgenstein, I'm not...

641
00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:37,760
 I mean, he's a great comedian, but...

642
00:31:37,760 --> 00:31:39,760
 Trigger Happy TV is the track artist

643
00:31:39,760 --> 00:31:41,760
 and Roger Koch is the author because of its date,

644
00:31:41,760 --> 00:31:43,760
 in my opinion.

645
00:31:43,760 --> 00:31:45,760
 He was another one who recorded when he masturbated.

646
00:31:45,760 --> 00:31:47,760
 Oh, good.

647
00:31:47,760 --> 00:31:49,760
 Wittgenstein.

648
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:51,760
 Before I think.

649
00:31:51,760 --> 00:31:53,760
 Who did we mention had done it in a previous episode?

650
00:31:53,760 --> 00:31:55,760
 Was it Hook?

651
00:31:55,760 --> 00:31:57,760
 Yes, that's it.

652
00:31:57,760 --> 00:31:59,760
 But Wittgenstein continued that tradition

653
00:31:59,760 --> 00:32:01,760
 and he wrote in his diary during World War I.

654
00:32:01,760 --> 00:32:03,760
 He would write in his diary when he'd masturbated.

655
00:32:03,760 --> 00:32:05,760
 And actually, this is a...

656
00:32:05,760 --> 00:32:07,760
 I couldn't find a verification of this

657
00:32:07,760 --> 00:32:09,760
 but I think we trust him.

658
00:32:09,760 --> 00:32:11,760
 And he said that Wittgenstein used to get annoyed

659
00:32:11,760 --> 00:32:13,760
 because his fantasies while he was masturbating

660
00:32:13,760 --> 00:32:15,760
 kept on being plagued by mass problems.

661
00:32:15,760 --> 00:32:17,760
 And he found this very annoying.

662
00:32:17,760 --> 00:32:19,760
 Distracting. I think it's a problem that we've all had.

663
00:32:19,760 --> 00:32:23,760
 He wouldn't be the first person to be thinking about an ex.

664
00:32:23,760 --> 00:32:27,760
 Very strong. Wonderful.

665
00:32:27,760 --> 00:32:36,760
 OK, it is time for fact number three, and that is Andy.

666
00:32:36,760 --> 00:32:38,760
 My fact is that in 1801,

667
00:32:38,760 --> 00:32:42,760
 England had a celebrity ox which had its own coach and horses.

668
00:32:42,760 --> 00:32:44,760
 Amazing.

669
00:32:44,760 --> 00:32:47,760
 Yeah, so this is from a great book

670
00:32:47,760 --> 00:32:50,760
 called Jane Austen's Country Life by Deirdre Le Fay,

671
00:32:50,760 --> 00:32:52,760
 which is all about life in rural England

672
00:32:52,760 --> 00:32:54,760
 in the early 19th century.

673
00:32:54,760 --> 00:32:58,760
 And there was this ox which had been bred

674
00:32:58,760 --> 00:33:02,760
 by a man called Charles Colling of Kettenhall in Durham.

675
00:33:02,760 --> 00:33:05,760
 And it was known as the Kettenhawks at first,

676
00:33:05,760 --> 00:33:08,760
 and then it was renamed, so it became the Durham ox.

677
00:33:08,760 --> 00:33:10,760
 And Colling was interested in cattle breeding,

678
00:33:10,760 --> 00:33:12,760
 and he was one of the pioneers of breeding animals

679
00:33:12,760 --> 00:33:14,760
 to make them really, really big.

680
00:33:14,760 --> 00:33:18,760
 And the Durham ox was a huge success,

681
00:33:18,760 --> 00:33:21,760
 and I mean that in every sense.

682
00:33:21,760 --> 00:33:28,760
 It was reported as being between 170 stone and 270 stone.

683
00:33:28,760 --> 00:33:30,760
 Stones weren't standardized at the time,

684
00:33:30,760 --> 00:33:34,760
 but it was well over 1,000 kilos, this bull.

685
00:33:34,760 --> 00:33:38,760
 And it was about four times the size of a modern cow, basically.

686
00:33:38,760 --> 00:33:39,760
 It was really big.

687
00:33:39,760 --> 00:33:41,760
 It was impressive. It sounds impressive.

688
00:33:41,760 --> 00:33:43,760
 Because cows are big already. They're quite big.

689
00:33:43,760 --> 00:33:44,760
 Cows are big.

690
00:33:44,760 --> 00:33:46,760
 Yeah, it's interesting because now there's a lot of pressure

691
00:33:46,760 --> 00:33:48,760
 on celebrities to lose weight,

692
00:33:48,760 --> 00:33:50,760
 but it sounds like back in the day,

693
00:33:50,760 --> 00:33:53,760
 there was a lot of pressure on celebrities to be as heavy as possible.

694
00:33:53,760 --> 00:33:54,760
 That's very true.

695
00:33:54,760 --> 00:33:55,760
 So that's something that's changed,

696
00:33:55,760 --> 00:33:58,760
 as well as the fact that celebrities have cows back today.

697
00:33:58,760 --> 00:34:00,760
 Can I just say a fact about a celebrity animal?

698
00:34:00,760 --> 00:34:02,760
 Because I was going to do this as my fact next week,

699
00:34:02,760 --> 00:34:05,760
 but I think I'll say it now anyway to see what happens.

700
00:34:05,760 --> 00:34:09,760
 In the third series of French Big Brother,

701
00:34:09,760 --> 00:34:13,760
 one of the housemates was a dog.

702
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:14,760
 Really?

703
00:34:14,760 --> 00:34:16,760
 And it was a dog called Saucisse.

704
00:34:16,760 --> 00:34:20,760
 And part of the rules were you had to have a secret,

705
00:34:20,760 --> 00:34:23,760
 and all of the housemates had to work out what your secret was.

706
00:34:23,760 --> 00:34:27,760
 And Saucisse's secret was that he once ran for the mayor of Marseille.

707
00:34:27,760 --> 00:34:30,760
 And did he spill it on the first day?

708
00:34:30,760 --> 00:34:36,760
 Did they have to work out what the secret was, did you say?

709
00:34:36,760 --> 00:34:38,760
 Yeah, they had to work out each other's secrets.

710
00:34:38,760 --> 00:34:43,760
 That is absolutely impossible to work out from what the dog's giving you.

711
00:34:43,760 --> 00:34:46,760
 I know what you mean, but Saucisse, the dog,

712
00:34:46,760 --> 00:34:49,760
 doesn't really have an ability to form complex thoughts.

713
00:34:49,760 --> 00:34:51,760
 So he's also a disadvantage.

714
00:34:51,760 --> 00:34:53,760
 Well, it's like Vik Gunnstein said.

715
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:55,760
 He said, "If Saucisse the dog could talk,

716
00:34:55,760 --> 00:35:00,760
 we wouldn't understand his platform to be the mayor of Marseille."

717
00:35:00,760 --> 00:35:01,760
 Sorry, Andy.

718
00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:02,760
 We should talk about the arcs.

719
00:35:02,760 --> 00:35:07,760
 No, actually, genuinely, I'm quite interested in talking more about Saucisse.

720
00:35:07,760 --> 00:35:08,760
 Where did he place?

721
00:35:08,760 --> 00:35:10,760
 Where did he place in the final?

722
00:35:10,760 --> 00:35:11,760
 I can't remember.

723
00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:16,760
 I haven't done the research on it because it isn't one of my facts yet for the show.

724
00:35:16,760 --> 00:35:20,760
 So, anyway, that's now comparatively dull ox,

725
00:35:20,760 --> 00:35:24,760
 which never, as far as I can tell, ran for elected office anywhere, lazy.

726
00:35:24,760 --> 00:35:28,760
 But it was bought by a man called John Day for a couple of hundred quid.

727
00:35:28,760 --> 00:35:33,760
 And it had a special carriage, and it was pulled around by four horses.

728
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:36,760
 It toured England and Scotland for five years.

729
00:35:36,760 --> 00:35:40,760
 It played 200 different venues across the UK.

730
00:35:40,760 --> 00:35:41,760
 It's amazing.

731
00:35:41,760 --> 00:35:43,760
 Many more gigs than we have done as a podcast.

732
00:35:43,760 --> 00:35:44,760
 Put it that way.

733
00:35:44,760 --> 00:35:46,760
 Yeah, it played international gigs as well.

734
00:35:46,760 --> 00:35:49,760
 It played Madison Square Garden, which it did.

735
00:35:49,760 --> 00:35:50,760
 Exactly.

736
00:35:50,760 --> 00:35:51,760
 It played Madison Square Garden.

737
00:35:51,760 --> 00:35:52,760
 So a couple of weeks ago.

738
00:35:52,760 --> 00:35:53,760
 Hang on.

739
00:35:53,760 --> 00:35:56,760
 I've mixed up my famous celebrity oxes.

740
00:35:56,760 --> 00:35:57,760
 Yeah.

741
00:35:57,760 --> 00:35:58,760
 It was a different ox.

742
00:35:58,760 --> 00:35:59,760
 Very sorry.

743
00:35:59,760 --> 00:36:00,760
 Back out on that one.

744
00:36:00,760 --> 00:36:01,760
 OK.

745
00:36:01,760 --> 00:36:03,760
 I can't wait to hear about this other celebrity ox.

746
00:36:03,760 --> 00:36:06,760
 That's a spoiler for later in the show, yeah.

747
00:36:06,760 --> 00:36:09,760
 It wasn't just size that it was renowned for.

748
00:36:09,760 --> 00:36:11,760
 You can't just be big.

749
00:36:11,760 --> 00:36:13,760
 It was also symmetry, apparently.

750
00:36:13,760 --> 00:36:14,760
 They're the two attributes.

751
00:36:14,760 --> 00:36:16,760
 And if you look at news articles from the time,

752
00:36:16,760 --> 00:36:18,760
 it's always about its size and its symmetry.

753
00:36:18,760 --> 00:36:21,760
 So you had to be balanced on each side.

754
00:36:21,760 --> 00:36:24,760
 And it was, bulls would be advertised as having been

755
00:36:24,760 --> 00:36:26,760
 sired by the Durham ox, wouldn't they?

756
00:36:26,760 --> 00:36:28,760
 And there was sort of like a type of ox

757
00:36:28,760 --> 00:36:30,760
 that was called Durham ox after this.

758
00:36:30,760 --> 00:36:34,760
 He was so famous that he became his own breed, I suppose.

759
00:36:34,760 --> 00:36:38,760
 Well, do you know about the breeding of his parentage?

760
00:36:38,760 --> 00:36:39,760
 Please tell us.

761
00:36:39,760 --> 00:36:41,760
 It's very incest heavy.

762
00:36:41,760 --> 00:36:44,760
 This honestly makes Game of Thrones look like Rosie and Jim.

763
00:36:44,760 --> 00:36:47,760
 So there was a bull called Favourite,

764
00:36:47,760 --> 00:36:49,760
 who was bred with his own mother.

765
00:36:49,760 --> 00:36:51,760
 His mother was called Phoenix.

766
00:36:51,760 --> 00:36:53,760
 They produced a cow who was called Young Phoenix.

767
00:36:53,760 --> 00:36:55,760
 So Favourite had been bred with his own mum

768
00:36:55,760 --> 00:36:58,760
 to produce his daughter/sister, Young Phoenix.

769
00:36:58,760 --> 00:37:01,760
 But then Favourite was bred with his own daughter/sister,

770
00:37:01,760 --> 00:37:04,760
 Young Phoenix, to produce the Durham ox.

771
00:37:04,760 --> 00:37:08,760
 So as far as I can tell, the Durham ox's dad was his grandfather

772
00:37:08,760 --> 00:37:10,760
 and his mum was his half-sister.

773
00:37:10,760 --> 00:37:13,760
 Yeah. Or you could say that Young Phoenix was simultaneously

774
00:37:13,760 --> 00:37:16,760
 Favourite's daughter/sister and sexual partner.

775
00:37:16,760 --> 00:37:18,760
 Oh, boy.

776
00:37:18,760 --> 00:37:19,760
 Nice.

777
00:37:19,760 --> 00:37:21,760
 Well, it saves on giving presents a Christmas time, doesn't it?

778
00:37:21,760 --> 00:37:25,760
 What are you going to get?

779
00:37:25,760 --> 00:37:28,760
 Your daughter/sister mum and sexual partner.

780
00:37:28,760 --> 00:37:30,760
 Probably just going to a necklace.

781
00:37:30,760 --> 00:37:32,760
 It worked in breeding.

782
00:37:32,760 --> 00:37:35,760
 I mean, if what you're going for is massive cow,

783
00:37:35,760 --> 00:37:37,760
 then it did well.

784
00:37:37,760 --> 00:37:39,760
 You didn't want to get any genes involved that were inferior.

785
00:37:39,760 --> 00:37:40,760
 True.

786
00:37:40,760 --> 00:37:42,760
 And I think it was pioneered first by a guy called Robert Bakewell,

787
00:37:42,760 --> 00:37:45,760
 who was this massive guy in the agricultural revolution

788
00:37:45,760 --> 00:37:48,760
 who sort of made all his cows chag each other

789
00:37:48,760 --> 00:37:50,760
 within their own families.

790
00:37:50,760 --> 00:37:53,760
 And he revolutionised selective breeding, really.

791
00:37:53,760 --> 00:37:55,760
 And Darwin cited him quite a lot.

792
00:37:55,760 --> 00:37:57,760
 And he was incredible at building cows

793
00:37:57,760 --> 00:38:00,760
 to the ideal size and shape.

794
00:38:00,760 --> 00:38:03,760
 The Durham ox has an entire town in Australia named after it.

795
00:38:03,760 --> 00:38:04,760
 It's called Durham Ox.

796
00:38:04,760 --> 00:38:06,760
 It's got 74 people living there.

797
00:38:06,760 --> 00:38:09,760
 And I went on the Australia's Guide website,

798
00:38:09,760 --> 00:38:12,760
 which says there is one thing to do within 20 kilometres,

799
00:38:12,760 --> 00:38:15,760
 and that thing is a jumper shop.

800
00:38:15,760 --> 00:38:17,760
 So it's quiet.

801
00:38:17,760 --> 00:38:18,760
 Did you say a jumper shop?

802
00:38:18,760 --> 00:38:19,760
 Yeah.

803
00:38:19,760 --> 00:38:20,760
 It's in a shop that sells jumpers.

804
00:38:20,760 --> 00:38:21,760
 Sorry.

805
00:38:21,760 --> 00:38:24,760
 The jumper shop is the nearest local attraction.

806
00:38:24,760 --> 00:38:29,760
 But it's the safest place to live in the state of Victoria.

807
00:38:29,760 --> 00:38:34,760
 So in 2015, the news reported that there had been just seven crimes

808
00:38:34,760 --> 00:38:36,760
 in five years.

809
00:38:36,760 --> 00:38:37,760
 Wow.

810
00:38:37,760 --> 00:38:39,760
 This is how it broke down.

811
00:38:39,760 --> 00:38:40,760
 2014.

812
00:38:40,760 --> 00:38:43,760
 There was no jumper theft, as far as I can tell.

813
00:38:43,760 --> 00:38:45,760
 2014, there was an arson thing.

814
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:47,760
 That was quite a serious crime.

815
00:38:47,760 --> 00:38:49,760
 2013, no crimes.

816
00:38:49,760 --> 00:38:51,760
 2012, no crimes.

817
00:38:51,760 --> 00:38:54,760
 2011, there was one drug offence.

818
00:38:54,760 --> 00:38:57,760
 But in 2010, there was an abduction.

819
00:38:57,760 --> 00:38:58,760
 There was arson.

820
00:38:58,760 --> 00:39:00,760
 There was a weapon and explosives offence.

821
00:39:00,760 --> 00:39:03,760
 And there were two counts of disorderly and offensive conduct.

822
00:39:03,760 --> 00:39:06,760
 It sounds like the biggest year in Durham Oaks's history ever.

823
00:39:06,760 --> 00:39:09,760
 But wait, was that all one event?

824
00:39:09,760 --> 00:39:11,760
 Kind of like, "This is my sister, I love her."

825
00:39:11,760 --> 00:39:16,760
 Didn't mention any incest-related crimes.

826
00:39:16,760 --> 00:39:22,760
 Do you know what the second most safe place in Victoria is?

827
00:39:22,760 --> 00:39:23,760
 No.

828
00:39:23,760 --> 00:39:25,760
 I thought I might as well check it out.

829
00:39:25,760 --> 00:39:27,760
 You really go the extra mile.

830
00:39:27,760 --> 00:39:28,760
 This is brilliant.

831
00:39:28,760 --> 00:39:31,760
 So this is a place called Speed.

832
00:39:31,760 --> 00:39:34,760
 Okay, so again, they've had very, very few crimes.

833
00:39:34,760 --> 00:39:35,760
 It's a very small place.

834
00:39:35,760 --> 00:39:39,760
 But one thing that they did used to have a problem with was speeding,

835
00:39:39,760 --> 00:39:43,760
 because when you drive into speed, it's on a main road,

836
00:39:43,760 --> 00:39:46,760
 there's a big sign that says, "Welcome to speed."

837
00:39:46,760 --> 00:39:50,760
 People took that as an invitation

838
00:39:50,760 --> 00:39:53,760
 and would start going really fast in the town.

839
00:39:53,760 --> 00:39:57,760
 And so in 2011, the residents of Speed started a campaign

840
00:39:57,760 --> 00:40:01,760
 to get the name of the town changed to Speed Kills.

841
00:40:01,760 --> 00:40:03,760
 And they got 32,000 likes on Facebook

842
00:40:03,760 --> 00:40:06,760
 to try and get their name changed.

843
00:40:06,760 --> 00:40:10,760
 And in the end, they renamed the town for one month to Speed Kills.

844
00:40:10,760 --> 00:40:16,760
 And as part of the campaign, there was a local farmer called Phil Down,

845
00:40:16,760 --> 00:40:19,760
 and he changed his name to Phil Slowdown.

846
00:40:24,760 --> 00:40:28,760
 No, that's the secondest place in Victoria.

847
00:40:28,760 --> 00:40:32,760
 Durham Ox had a sort of quite sad end in a way.

848
00:40:32,760 --> 00:40:33,760
 Well, it died, yeah.

849
00:40:33,760 --> 00:40:38,760
 Yeah, so it dislocated its hip while being let out of the carriage,

850
00:40:38,760 --> 00:40:42,760
 the famous carriage that we've spoken about, while in Oxford.

851
00:40:42,760 --> 00:40:44,760
 And it had to be slaughtered two months later.

852
00:40:44,760 --> 00:40:48,760
 But day, ever the showman turned that into an event itself.

853
00:40:48,760 --> 00:40:51,760
 And I believe, correct me if I'm wrong guys,

854
00:40:51,760 --> 00:40:54,760
 there was an autopsy which was sort of shown to the public

855
00:40:54,760 --> 00:40:57,760
 on the day that it had died.

856
00:40:57,760 --> 00:41:00,760
 And I think they might have shown,

857
00:41:00,760 --> 00:41:03,760
 you might have been able to buy a ticket to watch it die, basically.

858
00:41:03,760 --> 00:41:05,760
 To watch it die, yeah.

859
00:41:05,760 --> 00:41:07,760
 But then it was, yeah, and then it was chopped up.

860
00:41:07,760 --> 00:41:12,760
 And part of the merch stand that he set up was selling offcuts

861
00:41:12,760 --> 00:41:14,760
 of the Durham Ox, yeah.

862
00:41:14,760 --> 00:41:15,760
 I don't think that's cool.

863
00:41:15,760 --> 00:41:17,760
 When you go to a butcher, I don't think you say,

864
00:41:17,760 --> 00:41:19,760
 you know, can you go to a merch stand over there

865
00:41:19,760 --> 00:41:21,760
 and get a lot of land, please?

866
00:41:21,760 --> 00:41:24,760
 It's not branded.

867
00:41:24,760 --> 00:41:26,760
 Well, it could be branded if it's a catalog.

868
00:41:26,760 --> 00:41:27,760
 Somewhere will be, yeah.

869
00:41:27,760 --> 00:41:29,760
 Yeah, OK.

870
00:41:29,760 --> 00:41:31,760
 I found another famous ox,

871
00:41:31,760 --> 00:41:33,760
 actually a couple of famous oxes,

872
00:41:33,760 --> 00:41:34,760
 and this was over in America.

873
00:41:34,760 --> 00:41:39,760
 There was two oxen called Mount Cotardin and A Granger,

874
00:41:39,760 --> 00:41:41,760
 named after the two biggest things.

875
00:41:41,760 --> 00:41:42,760
 Sorry.

876
00:41:42,760 --> 00:41:44,760
 Does anyone else feel a Madison Square?

877
00:41:44,760 --> 00:41:48,760
 I'm really excited to know what kind of venue they might have made.

878
00:41:48,760 --> 00:41:53,760
 So they were named after the two largest items in Maine at the time.

879
00:41:53,760 --> 00:41:55,760
 That's where they got their names from.

880
00:41:55,760 --> 00:41:57,760
 And they were humongous.

881
00:41:57,760 --> 00:42:01,760
 They were supposedly, I can't find anything to contradict this,

882
00:42:01,760 --> 00:42:04,760
 the biggest and tallest oxen, respectively,

883
00:42:04,760 --> 00:42:06,760
 that the world has ever seen.

884
00:42:06,760 --> 00:42:09,760
 So Mount Cotardin weighed two and a half tons.

885
00:42:09,760 --> 00:42:10,760
 Wow.

886
00:42:10,760 --> 00:42:13,760
 So they were tall, they were wide,

887
00:42:13,760 --> 00:42:15,760
 and they were celebrities, and they went around,

888
00:42:15,760 --> 00:42:17,760
 and they did a lot of gigs,

889
00:42:17,760 --> 00:42:20,760
 and eventually they played Madison Square Garden.

890
00:42:20,760 --> 00:42:21,760
 No.

891
00:42:21,760 --> 00:42:22,760
 No.

892
00:42:22,760 --> 00:42:23,760
 Oh, my God.

893
00:42:23,760 --> 00:42:26,760
 Yeah, Madison Square Garden, which...

894
00:42:26,760 --> 00:42:30,760
 We said a couple of weeks ago when Sarah was here, Sarah Pasco,

895
00:42:30,760 --> 00:42:33,760
 that, or you said, I think,

896
00:42:33,760 --> 00:42:36,760
 that was it, Emmeline Pynkhurst played Madison Square Gardens.

897
00:42:36,760 --> 00:42:37,760
 That's right.

898
00:42:37,760 --> 00:42:42,760
 And she had a crowd of 3,000 in a 19,000-seater stadium.

899
00:42:42,760 --> 00:42:46,760
 Do you know how many people went to see the oxen?

900
00:42:46,760 --> 00:42:49,760
 Actually, I assumed that it was the current Madison Square Garden

901
00:42:49,760 --> 00:42:52,760
 with the ginormous 18,000 capacity.

902
00:42:52,760 --> 00:42:55,760
 But actually, it turns out that it's been rebuilt a few times,

903
00:42:55,760 --> 00:42:57,760
 and she actually played the second iteration

904
00:42:57,760 --> 00:42:59,760
 of the Madison Square Garden,

905
00:42:59,760 --> 00:43:01,760
 which had a capacity of 8,000 people.

906
00:43:01,760 --> 00:43:04,760
 So she still was kind of suffering in the sales department.

907
00:43:04,760 --> 00:43:07,760
 She only sold 3,000, that's less than 50%,

908
00:43:07,760 --> 00:43:11,760
 but it's not as great a discrepancy as 18,000.

909
00:43:11,760 --> 00:43:14,760
 So, yeah, so apologies to all the people on Twitter

910
00:43:14,760 --> 00:43:15,760
 who've pointed this out.

911
00:43:15,760 --> 00:43:16,760
 Very, very sorry.

912
00:43:16,760 --> 00:43:19,760
 But this is the very same Madison Square Garden,

913
00:43:19,760 --> 00:43:20,760
 Madison Square Garden 2,

914
00:43:20,760 --> 00:43:24,760
 where these two giant oxen played in 1906.

915
00:43:24,760 --> 00:43:26,760
 They must have somewhere...

916
00:43:26,760 --> 00:43:28,760
 You know how some venues in the UK

917
00:43:28,760 --> 00:43:31,760
 have a book for all the acts that play there to sign?

918
00:43:31,760 --> 00:43:32,760
 Yeah.

919
00:43:32,760 --> 00:43:36,760
 Presumably, somewhere in the basement of Madison Square Gardens,

920
00:43:36,760 --> 00:43:38,760
 there is a book which has got the signature

921
00:43:38,760 --> 00:43:42,760
 of Emily Pankhurst and a poof print of a giant ox.

922
00:43:42,760 --> 00:43:46,760
 How cool, yeah.

923
00:43:46,760 --> 00:43:47,760
 We can only assume.

924
00:43:47,760 --> 00:43:49,760
 We haven't actually said what Mox is.

925
00:43:49,760 --> 00:43:50,760
 Oh.

926
00:43:50,760 --> 00:43:52,760
 It's a castrated male cow.

927
00:43:52,760 --> 00:43:57,760
 But they used to be really popular for farming,

928
00:43:57,760 --> 00:43:59,760
 and they used to be way more popular

929
00:43:59,760 --> 00:44:02,760
 as draft animals pulling plows and things than horses.

930
00:44:02,760 --> 00:44:04,760
 But there were a few disadvantages,

931
00:44:04,760 --> 00:44:07,760
 and gradually they went out of fashion a bit slower

932
00:44:07,760 --> 00:44:08,760
 and a bit less versatile.

933
00:44:08,760 --> 00:44:11,760
 One of the problems is you can't change their shoes.

934
00:44:11,760 --> 00:44:13,760
 Like you can a horse.

935
00:44:13,760 --> 00:44:16,760
 So horses stand on all four legs.

936
00:44:16,760 --> 00:44:19,760
 And when you want to change a shoe,

937
00:44:19,760 --> 00:44:21,760
 the horse can stand on three legs.

938
00:44:21,760 --> 00:44:22,760
 It can cope with that.

939
00:44:22,760 --> 00:44:23,760
 And you can change a shoe,

940
00:44:23,760 --> 00:44:25,760
 and then you put that down and you change the other shoes.

941
00:44:25,760 --> 00:44:26,760
 Oxen can't do that.

942
00:44:26,760 --> 00:44:28,760
 They can't stand on three legs.

943
00:44:28,760 --> 00:44:30,760
 So to put shoes on an ox,

944
00:44:30,760 --> 00:44:32,760
 which is necessary if you're farming with them,

945
00:44:32,760 --> 00:44:35,760
 what you have to do is you have to push it over

946
00:44:35,760 --> 00:44:37,760
 onto the ground.

947
00:44:37,760 --> 00:44:40,760
 And then you have to have basically a massive fork

948
00:44:40,760 --> 00:44:43,760
 to gently hold it in place by the neck.

949
00:44:43,760 --> 00:44:46,760
 And then you tie its feet together so you don't get gourd.

950
00:44:46,760 --> 00:44:47,760
 A pitchfork.

951
00:44:47,760 --> 00:44:48,760
 What?

952
00:44:48,760 --> 00:44:50,760
 You can't put a fork in its neck?

953
00:44:50,760 --> 00:44:51,760
 Around its neck.

954
00:44:51,760 --> 00:44:54,760
 It's gone either side, so it's like that.

955
00:44:54,760 --> 00:44:56,760
 It's like in action films

956
00:44:56,760 --> 00:44:58,760
 when someone always has a pitchfork thrown at them

957
00:44:58,760 --> 00:45:00,760
 and it lands on either side of their neck, doesn't it?

958
00:45:00,760 --> 00:45:01,760
 It's exactly like that.

959
00:45:01,760 --> 00:45:02,760
 Oh, yeah.

960
00:45:02,760 --> 00:45:05,760
 You can never see that in an action film.

961
00:45:05,760 --> 00:45:06,760
 Is that in Die Hard?

962
00:45:06,760 --> 00:45:07,760
 I'm not sure.

963
00:45:07,760 --> 00:45:08,760
 I don't really remember it.

964
00:45:08,760 --> 00:45:10,760
 It's in one of the sequels.

965
00:45:10,760 --> 00:45:12,760
 So that's one method.

966
00:45:12,760 --> 00:45:14,760
 And that's pretty hardcore.

967
00:45:14,760 --> 00:45:15,760
 You have to be pretty brave to do that.

968
00:45:15,760 --> 00:45:18,760
 The alternate method is to use a thing called an ox sling,

969
00:45:18,760 --> 00:45:20,760
 which is this massive framework of beams,

970
00:45:20,760 --> 00:45:21,760
 and you get the oxen to walk in,

971
00:45:21,760 --> 00:45:24,760
 and then you just lift it up off the ground

972
00:45:24,760 --> 00:45:26,760
 and you have it hovering in the air,

973
00:45:26,760 --> 00:45:28,760
 and then you have to fit the shoes like that.

974
00:45:28,760 --> 00:45:30,760
 So you can see where they went out of fashion.

975
00:45:30,760 --> 00:45:31,760
 Yeah.

976
00:45:31,760 --> 00:45:33,760
 So the ox, though, the sling one,

977
00:45:33,760 --> 00:45:35,760
 I prefer that to the lying on your back

978
00:45:35,760 --> 00:45:38,760
 with the pitchfork around your neck and your legs tied together.

979
00:45:38,760 --> 00:45:40,760
 If you had the choice.

980
00:45:40,760 --> 00:45:43,760
 Next time you're in plaques and buy some new shoes.

981
00:45:43,760 --> 00:45:48,760
 This is like Die Hard.

982
00:45:48,760 --> 00:45:57,760
 OK, it's time for our final fact of the show,

983
00:45:57,760 --> 00:45:59,760
 and that is my fact.

984
00:45:59,760 --> 00:46:02,760
 And the fact is that the World's Least Frequently Published

985
00:46:02,760 --> 00:46:05,760
 Newspaper is released once every four years on Leap Day.

986
00:46:05,760 --> 00:46:07,760
 The print edition costs €4.70,

987
00:46:07,760 --> 00:46:11,760
 or you can subscribe to it for €100 per century.

988
00:46:11,760 --> 00:46:14,760
 That's a cool subscription.

989
00:46:14,760 --> 00:46:17,760
 So this is La Bougie du Saper,

990
00:46:17,760 --> 00:46:21,760
 which is a satirical newspaper that began in 1980.

991
00:46:21,760 --> 00:46:25,760
 Two friends decided that they wanted to do this as a thing,

992
00:46:25,760 --> 00:46:27,760
 and they made it a reality.

993
00:46:27,760 --> 00:46:30,760
 The title translates as The Sapper's Candle,

994
00:46:30,760 --> 00:46:33,760
 and it's a reference to a cartoon character

995
00:46:33,760 --> 00:46:35,760
 who was called The Sapper Camembert,

996
00:46:35,760 --> 00:46:37,760
 and he was born on the 29th of February.

997
00:46:37,760 --> 00:46:40,760
 He joined the Army just as he celebrated his fourth birthday.

998
00:46:40,760 --> 00:46:42,760
 That's the reference to the title.

999
00:46:42,760 --> 00:46:44,760
 But yeah, it's a wonderful newspaper

1000
00:46:44,760 --> 00:46:46,760
 that is still going to this day,

1001
00:46:46,760 --> 00:46:49,760
 and it has a huge readership that just keeps growing and growing,

1002
00:46:49,760 --> 00:46:51,760
 and lots of lovely little in-jokes.

1003
00:46:51,760 --> 00:46:53,760
 They have a last-minute section

1004
00:46:53,760 --> 00:46:55,760
 that they managed to squeeze in, you know,

1005
00:46:55,760 --> 00:46:57,760
 and add news into it.

1006
00:46:57,760 --> 00:46:59,760
 Sometimes, obviously, if you've done the crossword,

1007
00:46:59,760 --> 00:47:03,760
 you've got to wait four years for the answers to appear.

1008
00:47:03,760 --> 00:47:05,760
 And sometimes they make the decision

1009
00:47:05,760 --> 00:47:07,760
 not to publish it until eight years later,

1010
00:47:07,760 --> 00:47:09,760
 the answers, and just keep people hanging.

1011
00:47:09,760 --> 00:47:12,760
 So yeah, they're really fun, these guys.

1012
00:47:12,760 --> 00:47:15,760
 I was surprised that you could get that subscription

1013
00:47:15,760 --> 00:47:18,760
 because there was an interview with the editor in 2012

1014
00:47:18,760 --> 00:47:20,760
 who said he had considered offering subscriptions,

1015
00:47:20,760 --> 00:47:22,760
 but it would be too difficult to find people

1016
00:47:22,760 --> 00:47:24,760
 as the likelihood as they would have moved house

1017
00:47:24,760 --> 00:47:26,760
 between publication dates.

1018
00:47:26,760 --> 00:47:28,760
 So he's obviously got a better way of tracking his...

1019
00:47:28,760 --> 00:47:32,760
 Well, it's a good way of getting 100 euros out of people, isn't it?

1020
00:47:32,760 --> 00:47:35,760
 They had a Sunday supplement in 2004,

1021
00:47:35,760 --> 00:47:38,760
 and the next one is going to be in 2032.

1022
00:47:38,760 --> 00:47:41,760
 So they kind of like do a kind of each day of the week thing,

1023
00:47:41,760 --> 00:47:43,760
 which is quite cool, I think.

1024
00:47:43,760 --> 00:47:45,760
 That's really good. And they're not working on this full-time, are they?

1025
00:47:45,760 --> 00:47:47,760
 They can't be.

1026
00:47:47,760 --> 00:47:49,760
 No, they don't. Once, say, every four years,

1027
00:47:49,760 --> 00:47:52,760
 they kind of meet up in a restaurant, I think, in Paris

1028
00:47:52,760 --> 00:47:54,760
 and drink champagne and kind of come up

1029
00:47:54,760 --> 00:47:56,760
 with what funny ideas they're going to put into it.

1030
00:47:56,760 --> 00:47:58,760
 Brilliant. That's so good.

1031
00:47:58,760 --> 00:48:00,760
 But the editor, the current editor, has been working on it

1032
00:48:00,760 --> 00:48:03,760
 for, you know, over a decade at least,

1033
00:48:03,760 --> 00:48:06,760
 and certainly has been the editor for about three issues or so.

1034
00:48:06,760 --> 00:48:09,760
 So it's got, you know, stable staff, which is good.

1035
00:48:09,760 --> 00:48:13,760
 And it does have a print run, I think, this year of 200,000,

1036
00:48:13,760 --> 00:48:16,760
 which is not to say that's the number that we'll sell,

1037
00:48:16,760 --> 00:48:20,760
 but that's a print run, so it's got big tickets on itself.

1038
00:48:20,760 --> 00:48:23,760
 Yeah, there's some interesting stories in this week,

1039
00:48:23,760 --> 00:48:26,760
 in this, not this week's, this, what do you say,

1040
00:48:26,760 --> 00:48:29,760
 quadrennial edition.

1041
00:48:29,760 --> 00:48:31,760
 They talk about Brexit, of course.

1042
00:48:31,760 --> 00:48:35,760
 There is an interview with Cedric Villani,

1043
00:48:35,760 --> 00:48:38,760
 the mathematician-commerical candidate.

1044
00:48:38,760 --> 00:48:42,760
 There is a story about Maurice, the cockerel.

1045
00:48:42,760 --> 00:48:44,760
 Do you remember this?

1046
00:48:44,760 --> 00:48:46,760
 They're basically talking about all the things that have happened

1047
00:48:46,760 --> 00:48:48,760
 over the last four years.

1048
00:48:48,760 --> 00:48:50,760
 And one of them was Maurice the cockerel,

1049
00:48:50,760 --> 00:48:54,760
 who became really famous because people were complaining

1050
00:48:54,760 --> 00:48:56,760
 that he was cockrelling too loud.

1051
00:48:56,760 --> 00:48:59,760
 And the people who lived in the countryside said,

1052
00:48:59,760 --> 00:49:01,760
 well, this is what the countryside sounds like.

1053
00:49:01,760 --> 00:49:04,760
 So if you don't like it, go back to Paris, kind of thing.

1054
00:49:04,760 --> 00:49:08,760
 And they came up with a law basically protecting

1055
00:49:08,760 --> 00:49:10,760
 the sound of the French countryside.

1056
00:49:10,760 --> 00:49:12,760
 I'm sure you guys remember that story.

1057
00:49:12,760 --> 00:49:16,760
 I found out that since the magazine came out, Maurice died.

1058
00:49:16,760 --> 00:49:18,760
 He died in June.

1059
00:49:18,760 --> 00:49:20,760
 Is there any merch that we can get hold of of Maurice

1060
00:49:20,760 --> 00:49:23,760
 since maybe a breast or a leg?

1061
00:49:23,760 --> 00:49:29,760
 He actually, he died in May, but it was announced in June

1062
00:49:29,760 --> 00:49:32,760
 because the owner said that what with lockdown,

1063
00:49:32,760 --> 00:49:34,760
 people already had enough to worry about

1064
00:49:34,760 --> 00:49:38,760
 without having to think about Maurice the cockerel's death.

1065
00:49:38,760 --> 00:49:41,760
 That just would have been the cherry on the icing, wouldn't it?

1066
00:49:41,760 --> 00:49:43,760
 Damn you, 2020!

1067
00:49:43,760 --> 00:49:49,760
 So I was looking into some other interesting

1068
00:49:49,760 --> 00:49:51,760
 or innovative newspapers.

1069
00:49:51,760 --> 00:49:53,760
 And I don't think we've ever said this.

1070
00:49:53,760 --> 00:49:56,760
 Quite a few newspapers used to have space

1071
00:49:56,760 --> 00:49:58,760
 that you could add your own news in.

1072
00:49:58,760 --> 00:50:00,760
 This is so cool.

1073
00:50:00,760 --> 00:50:04,760
 So the first ever evening paper was launched in 1696

1074
00:50:04,760 --> 00:50:07,760
 by a guy called Ichabod Dorks.

1075
00:50:09,760 --> 00:50:11,760
 Such a good name.

1076
00:50:11,760 --> 00:50:15,760
 DAWK, not D-O-R-K, great either way.

1077
00:50:15,760 --> 00:50:16,760
 What a name.

1078
00:50:16,760 --> 00:50:19,760
 It's called Dorks Newsletter, that's the name of it.

1079
00:50:19,760 --> 00:50:23,760
 And basically, there was just space.

1080
00:50:23,760 --> 00:50:27,760
 So the buyer, who might be the grocer or might be the individual,

1081
00:50:27,760 --> 00:50:29,760
 but you could write your own news in,

1082
00:50:29,760 --> 00:50:32,760
 or you could say hello to an individual subscriber.

1083
00:50:32,760 --> 00:50:36,760
 But it's amazing that only Dorks are going to be bothered to do that, right?

1084
00:50:36,760 --> 00:50:39,760
 Wait, but what do you mean you could write a message to a subscriber?

1085
00:50:39,760 --> 00:50:42,760
 So who was allowed to write the news in the blank bit?

1086
00:50:42,760 --> 00:50:46,760
 Anyone is, but let's say it's the local news agent.

1087
00:50:46,760 --> 00:50:48,760
 You could say hello, Mr Jenkins,

1088
00:50:48,760 --> 00:50:51,760
 thought you might like to know that Murray's The Cockerel is Dead,

1089
00:50:51,760 --> 00:50:54,760
 waited to tell you until now because you would have been sad.

1090
00:50:54,760 --> 00:50:55,760
 And then you could add that in.

1091
00:50:55,760 --> 00:50:57,760
 Or even as the end user of the newspaper,

1092
00:50:57,760 --> 00:51:00,760
 you can also write in it and then hand it over to your wife saying,

1093
00:51:00,760 --> 00:51:03,760
 "I've made you some nice pie," if you write in that bit.

1094
00:51:03,760 --> 00:51:05,760
 That's very cool, very nice.

1095
00:51:05,760 --> 00:51:09,760
 I was reading about, it's now online, it's called The Antarctic Sun,

1096
00:51:09,760 --> 00:51:14,760
 but that used to be a paper that was published for people who live,

1097
00:51:14,760 --> 00:51:16,760
 the scientists who live in Antarctica,

1098
00:51:16,760 --> 00:51:18,760
 and it'd be sent round to them all,

1099
00:51:18,760 --> 00:51:21,760
 and it would cover sort of relevant news to them

1100
00:51:21,760 --> 00:51:24,760
 as opposed to news from the rest of the world.

1101
00:51:24,760 --> 00:51:26,760
 Was there a weather report?

1102
00:51:26,760 --> 00:51:31,760
 Getting very slightly warmer.

1103
00:51:31,760 --> 00:51:34,760
 But before them, before they existed,

1104
00:51:34,760 --> 00:51:37,760
 there was another paper which was called The McMurdo News,

1105
00:51:37,760 --> 00:51:39,760
 the sort of predecessor to them,

1106
00:51:39,760 --> 00:51:43,760
 and that was then followed by The McMurdo Sometimes,

1107
00:51:43,760 --> 00:51:46,760
 because the publishing schedule was so erratic

1108
00:51:46,760 --> 00:51:49,760
 that they couldn't promise that it would always be consistent.

1109
00:51:49,760 --> 00:51:53,760
 And that lasted from 1960 to 1980 as a paper.

1110
00:51:53,760 --> 00:51:54,760
 I love that.

1111
00:51:54,760 --> 00:51:56,760
 Although did you know that McMurdo Sometimes

1112
00:51:56,760 --> 00:51:59,760
 changed its name halfway through to The McMurdo Sometimes?

1113
00:51:59,760 --> 00:52:00,760
 Explain that.

1114
00:52:00,760 --> 00:52:02,760
 It was The McMurdo Sometimes in 1960,

1115
00:52:02,760 --> 00:52:05,760
 but it was spelled S-O-M-E-T-I-M-E-Z.

1116
00:52:05,760 --> 00:52:07,760
 And then for some reason, in 1972,

1117
00:52:07,760 --> 00:52:10,760
 they decided to change the name to spell the word Sometimes correctly.

1118
00:52:10,760 --> 00:52:12,760
 That's right, professionalizing.

1119
00:52:12,760 --> 00:52:14,760
 Maybe they got a publisher without a sense of humour.

1120
00:52:14,760 --> 00:52:15,760
 Bizarre.

1121
00:52:15,760 --> 00:52:19,760
 The latest article in the, what is now The Antarctic Sun,

1122
00:52:19,760 --> 00:52:20,760
 did you see what it was about?

1123
00:52:20,760 --> 00:52:21,760
 No.

1124
00:52:21,760 --> 00:52:23,760
 Well, I think Andy might want to subscribe,

1125
00:52:23,760 --> 00:52:24,760
 maybe move to Antarctica,

1126
00:52:24,760 --> 00:52:27,760
 because it was called Masses of Mosses.

1127
00:52:27,760 --> 00:52:31,760
 It was about the moss that's taking over Antarctica.

1128
00:52:31,760 --> 00:52:33,760
 Get me on a plane.

1129
00:52:33,760 --> 00:52:34,760
 Brilliant.

1130
00:52:34,760 --> 00:52:37,760
 I imagine it's probably also covered in the docks times,

1131
00:52:37,760 --> 00:52:39,760
 or whatever it was.

1132
00:52:39,760 --> 00:52:41,760
 Anna, as soon as you said that, I thought,

1133
00:52:41,760 --> 00:52:43,760
 which thing am I going to be slammed for now?

1134
00:52:43,760 --> 00:52:45,760
 Is it going to be moss or is it going to be funicular railways?

1135
00:52:45,760 --> 00:52:47,760
 Is it going to be one of the other things I developed

1136
00:52:47,760 --> 00:52:50,760
 and unlikely crush on in the last six years?

1137
00:52:50,760 --> 00:52:52,760
 And did you manage, by the time I did the big reveal,

1138
00:52:52,760 --> 00:52:54,760
 did you manage to have worked out which was more likely

1139
00:52:54,760 --> 00:52:55,760
 to exist in Antarctica?

1140
00:52:55,760 --> 00:52:57,760
 I thought they can't be really funicular.

1141
00:52:57,760 --> 00:53:01,760
 OK, that's it.

1142
00:53:01,760 --> 00:53:02,760
 That is all of our facts.

1143
00:53:02,760 --> 00:53:03,760
