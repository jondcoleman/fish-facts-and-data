WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.000
 Hey guys, Andy here. Just before we start this week's show, we have an exciting announcement to make which is that we are returning to the stage.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:15.440
 We have a show. It's a live show booked in and it's going to be at the London podcast festival later this month.

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:22.840
 It's going to be on the 27th of September at King's Place, which is in London. It's going to be at 7pm and it is going to be so much fun.

00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:31.600
 But Andy, I don't live in London and/or I don't want to go to a gig because I'm a bit worried about leaving the house at the moment. Can I see the show?

00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:41.480
 Of course you can, James, because not only is it being done very carefully with only a very limited number of tickets being sold to its all-social distance, you can also get streaming tickets.

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:48.680
 So you can go online and at that time you can watch us make fools of ourselves with stupid facts on stage.

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:51.000
 So how do I get these tickets, Andrew?

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:58.520
 James, all you have to do is go to qi.com/fishevents and I'll say that again, qi.com/fishevents.

00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:02.560
 And when I say events, I mean event because it is the only thing in our diaries.

00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:08.360
 So for your possibly last ever chance to see us on a stage, just go there.

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:09.760
 No, we'll be back on top next year.

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:11.760
 Oh, I hope so.

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:15.360
 But Andrew, what is going to happen next?

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:18.760
 The show is going to happen next. Oh, I better do that. Yeah, on with the show.

00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:20.760
 On with the podcast.

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:23.760
 [Music]

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:42.760
 Hello and welcome to another episode of No Such Thing As a Fish, a weekly podcast coming to you from four undisclosed locations in the UK.

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:44.760
 My name is Dan Schreiber.

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:48.760
 I am sitting here with James Harkin, Andrew Honto Murray and Anna Czazinski.

00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:53.760
 And once again, we have gathered round the microphones with our four favourite facts from the last seven days.

00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:58.760
 And in no particular order, here we go. Starting with you, Anna.

00:01:58.760 --> 00:02:06.760
 My fact this week is that by complete coincidence, the centre of North America is called Centre.

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:09.760
 It's amazing. It's mad.

00:02:09.760 --> 00:02:15.760
 So a lot of people weirdly put quite a lot of effort into working out the geographic centre of various places.

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:19.760
 And this is the latest research on the centre of the whole of North America.

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:24.760
 And it's mainland North America, so not including the islands.

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:30.760
 And this research was done by a university of buffalo geologists called Peter Rodgerson.

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:36.760
 And he worked out this mathematical way of defining the centre of a place which has never been used before.

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:40.760
 And essentially, he ran his sums, ran his algorithms.

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:44.760
 And the place that was thrown up was a place called Centre in North Dakota.

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:47.760
 It's quite a bit of a total chance. It's insane.

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:51.760
 It's tiny, isn't it? It's 1.24 kilometres square.

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:54.760
 So it's not even like it's a big place that had a big chance of being it.

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:59.760
 No. It is quite weird because there's no way of actually working out the middle of somewhere.

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:01.760
 There's no universally agreed way.

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:08.760
 So his mathematical definition is that the centre's location minimises the sum of squared distances to all other points in a region.

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:11.760
 So if you want to work out the middle of something, there you go. That's how you do it.

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:17.760
 The way he changed it is that he realised the way we've worked out the middle of places before hasn't accounted for the curvature of the Earth.

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:21.760
 And so that actually affects distances whereabouts on the curvature of the Earth you are.

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:23.760
 So he used this special 3D projection.

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:29.760
 And I wonder how many different methods he came up with before it yielded somewhere in the centre.

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:38.760
 Well, he reckons that his isn't exactly perfect because he hasn't taken into account that the planet is a slight ellipsoid so that it's not a perfect bowl.

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:43.760
 So maybe when he moves through, he might find out that the middle is...

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:48.760
 See, this is where they're going to get shot in the foot that they're only 1.24 kilometres.

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:53.760
 If they were a bit bigger, they might still be the centre, but this is a very small fraction out of them.

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:58.760
 Well, maybe there'll be a massive population boom of people flooding to the area, given this exciting news.

00:03:58.760 --> 00:04:05.760
 I love it, though. I love the competition between different centres because there is so much skull-duggery going on.

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:09.760
 So I'm sure you guys all found the place that was Rugby.

00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:13.760
 Rugby also in North Dakota, so quite near centre, probably.

00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:18.760
 They announced that they were the centre of North America in 1931.

00:04:18.760 --> 00:04:22.760
 And they put up a stone monument and they used to hold a...

00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:27.760
 They might even still hold a Miss Geographic Centre beauty pageant every year.

00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:30.760
 And every September, they have a Geographic Centre Day,

00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:35.760
 which features a mechanical bull and a basketball tournament for reasons that are not immediately plain.

00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:40.760
 I think because they're both quite American things that Americans like to do, isn't it?

00:04:40.760 --> 00:04:47.760
 It'd be weird if they had a paella-making competition and a boomerang throwing competition.

00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:55.760
 So this place, Rugby, it could be that when they take into account the fact that the earth is shaped a little bit like a rugby ball,

00:04:55.760 --> 00:04:59.760
 that Rugby then becomes the centre of America. Would that be nice?

00:04:59.760 --> 00:05:01.760
 Yeah, I'd love that.

00:05:01.760 --> 00:05:05.760
 Fingers crossed, calling on mathematicians to force that to be true.

00:05:05.760 --> 00:05:11.760
 So there's another place which is in North Dakota that also claimed to be the centre of North America called Robinson.

00:05:11.760 --> 00:05:15.760
 And it was the mayor who declared that it was the centre.

00:05:15.760 --> 00:05:21.760
 And specifically, a bar that he owns called Hansen's Bar was the absolute centre.

00:05:21.760 --> 00:05:26.760
 And quite nicely, he had this idea when he was drinking with his buddies in the bar,

00:05:26.760 --> 00:05:30.760
 and his name is Bill Bender, which is a perfect going on a Bender drinking.

00:05:30.760 --> 00:05:33.760
 Yeah, paying the bill.

00:05:33.760 --> 00:05:42.760
 So both of these two towns, Rugby and Robinson, are furious that it's been calculated that centre is in fact the centre.

00:05:42.760 --> 00:05:46.760
 Yeah, although you've got to be suspicious of the guy who was randomly drinking with his mates in a bar

00:05:46.760 --> 00:05:51.760
 and thought, let's try and work out where the centre of North America is, and it happened to be the bar they were drinking in.

00:05:51.760 --> 00:05:55.760
 It's his bar. This is a complete con designed to get people to build that bar.

00:05:55.760 --> 00:05:59.760
 No, it's infuriated because there was a big New York Times piece about it.

00:05:59.760 --> 00:06:02.760
 And the New York Times, because they're very diligent in fact checkers, they said,

00:06:02.760 --> 00:06:06.760
 how did you calculate that you are the exact centre of North America?

00:06:06.760 --> 00:06:11.760
 And his words were, it was trial and error. I can't give you an exact formula.

00:06:11.760 --> 00:06:15.760
 And then he said it was bar room science that they'd used.

00:06:15.760 --> 00:06:22.760
 And then when Rugby got involved, because Bill Bender registered his bar as the legal owner of the phrase,

00:06:22.760 --> 00:06:27.760
 geographical centre of North America, because Rugby had let it lapse in 2009 foolishly.

00:06:27.760 --> 00:06:30.760
 They took their eyes off the ball and Bill Bender grabbed it.

00:06:30.760 --> 00:06:34.760
 So when Rugby sent a legal letter to him, he offered to fight the mayor of Rugby.

00:06:34.760 --> 00:06:38.760
 I don't think he's not reputable enough to own the centre of North America, in my opinion.

00:06:38.760 --> 00:06:48.760
 I think it sounds like a wily businessman under your jealous that you haven't come up with any such idea to sell your various shows and products over the years.

00:06:48.760 --> 00:06:52.760
 By the way, I looked on Wikipedia of places in America called centre.

00:06:52.760 --> 00:06:58.760
 And there are over 15 actual towns and then there's places where no one lives that are called centre,

00:06:58.760 --> 00:07:06.760
 but roughly 15 places that are all called centre, all for the exact same reason that they claim to be the centre of Alabama or wherever it is that they are,

00:07:06.760 --> 00:07:12.760
 all except one, which is centre in Georgia, which was actually named after a man called Mr Centre.

00:07:12.760 --> 00:07:14.760
 That's the only one.

00:07:14.760 --> 00:07:21.760
 It used to be that in America you would put your kind of county hall in exactly the middle of your county,

00:07:21.760 --> 00:07:24.760
 because they thought it was like more accessible.

00:07:24.760 --> 00:07:30.760
 Like for instance, if the parliament in the UK is in London, obviously the people in Scotland have to travel a long way to get there.

00:07:30.760 --> 00:07:35.760
 But if it was exactly in the middle of the country, the idea is it's more accessible for more people.

00:07:35.760 --> 00:07:39.760
 Yeah, I think that is sort of the only reason to work out where a centre is.

00:07:39.760 --> 00:07:45.760
 Isn't it to work out where to put your seat of government and then to satisfy weird facts lovers.

00:07:45.760 --> 00:07:50.760
 There is a problem with being in the centre of America, someone found out.

00:07:50.760 --> 00:07:56.760
 There's this massive problem that was generated for someone who lives quite near the centre of the US, in fact.

00:07:56.760 --> 00:07:59.760
 And this has to do with a company called MaxMind.

00:07:59.760 --> 00:08:01.760
 Have you read about this story about IP addresses?

00:08:01.760 --> 00:08:11.760
 So it's so weird. Basically MaxMind is this company who about just over 10 years ago started calculating the location of loads of IP addresses.

00:08:11.760 --> 00:08:13.760
 So you know with your computer you've got an IP address.

00:08:13.760 --> 00:08:20.760
 MaxMind figured out whereabouts they all were geographically and then it could sell that information to companies like Google and Facebook and lots of other people.

00:08:20.760 --> 00:08:24.760
 But often when you're trying to work out where an IP address is, you can't get it exact.

00:08:24.760 --> 00:08:28.760
 And sometimes it'll just say this is somewhere in America or somewhere in the US.

00:08:28.760 --> 00:08:33.760
 And so for all of those, MaxMind just default assumed that they were in the middle.

00:08:33.760 --> 00:08:37.760
 So they got the coordinates of roughly the middle of America and said,

00:08:37.760 --> 00:08:41.760
 OK, all the IP addresses that we can't quite place, they just are here.

00:08:41.760 --> 00:08:47.760
 And it turns out here is a rural farmhouse belonging to someone called Joyce Taylor,

00:08:47.760 --> 00:08:52.760
 who now has 600 million IP addresses registered to her farmhouse.

00:08:52.760 --> 00:08:59.760
 And it's a complete disaster because basically if there's a troll online or if there's someone who's hacked your company

00:08:59.760 --> 00:09:03.760
 or if there's someone doing criminal activity online and the police are tracking them down,

00:09:03.760 --> 00:09:08.760
 they chase up their IP address and they constantly find it's at Joyce Taylor's farmhouse.

00:09:08.760 --> 00:09:14.760
 And she's just inundated with kind of abuse and people writing her threatening letters and had no idea why.

00:09:14.760 --> 00:09:20.760
 For about eight years she was just like, why am I being, what's happening to me until this journalist tracked her down?

00:09:20.760 --> 00:09:25.760
 Are we definitely discounting the fact that Joyce is like a massive cyber criminal?

00:09:25.760 --> 00:09:31.760
 She's a criminal mastermind, an 82-year-old criminal mastermind. It's possible.

00:09:31.760 --> 00:09:34.760
 That's funny. Oh, poor Joyce.

00:09:34.760 --> 00:09:38.760
 They used to work out the middle of America by doing a cardboard cutout of the whole country

00:09:38.760 --> 00:09:41.760
 and then balancing it on their finger.

00:09:41.760 --> 00:09:44.760
 And wherever it balanced, that's where the center was. Isn't that amazing?

00:09:44.760 --> 00:09:46.760
 It seems like, is it quite a good method?

00:09:46.760 --> 00:09:51.760
 Yeah, they got this, they got it accurate to within 20 miles of the current center.

00:09:51.760 --> 00:09:59.760
 What do they do? I know that they use the exact same method for countries that have islands that sit around because they're obviously apart.

00:09:59.760 --> 00:10:04.760
 Do they include, when they do the cardboard cutout, do they sort of just slam that onto the end or do they include the ocean bit?

00:10:04.760 --> 00:10:10.760
 That's difficult, isn't it? Because you couldn't just slam it onto the side because if it's further away from the pivot, it's going to be weighing more.

00:10:10.760 --> 00:10:14.760
 But then you can't attach it because then the thing you've attached it with weighs something.

00:10:14.760 --> 00:10:17.760
 So that actually sounds like it might be a slight flaw in the system.

00:10:17.760 --> 00:10:23.760
 That's true. The UK, I looked up the Ordnance Survey website and found out how they calculate the center.

00:10:23.760 --> 00:10:31.760
 And they actually said, they say on their website now, we calculate the center of Great Britain using the gravitational method.

00:10:31.760 --> 00:10:34.760
 So that is the one you're talking about. That is the cardboard cutout.

00:10:34.760 --> 00:10:36.760
 Wow, really? That's the news, effectively, yeah.

00:10:36.760 --> 00:10:42.760
 Do they probably do like a simulation of a cardboard cutout using a massive supercomputer?

00:10:42.760 --> 00:10:46.760
 They don't go into detail, actually, which makes me think it's probably a cardboard cutout.

00:10:46.760 --> 00:10:49.760
 Where is the center of the UK? It's in Lancashire, isn't it?

00:10:49.760 --> 00:10:53.760
 Yeah, it is. It's the forest of Boland.

00:10:53.760 --> 00:10:57.760
 Oh, yeah. There's one claim that it's a place called Meridan.

00:10:57.760 --> 00:11:00.760
 Meridan, I think, is the center of England because I've been to Meridan.

00:11:00.760 --> 00:11:02.760
 Oh, is the center of England, yes.

00:11:02.760 --> 00:11:09.760
 Forest of Boland, where my grandfather, I think, was born, is just in North... No, it's central Lancashire, I think.

00:11:09.760 --> 00:11:14.760
 Right. But there is, in the Meridan one, there is a monument that stands there.

00:11:14.760 --> 00:11:17.760
 It's been there for 500 years. You can go and visit it.

00:11:17.760 --> 00:11:19.760
 I have done that, of course. Have you? No way.

00:11:19.760 --> 00:11:24.760
 Of course I have. I was once within 20 miles of the center of the UK with my long-suffering wife and said,

00:11:24.760 --> 00:11:28.760
 "Oh, like, I've just noticed somewhere I could take a photo."

00:11:28.760 --> 00:11:30.760
 And we drove that extra bit.

00:11:30.760 --> 00:11:32.760
 Wow. That's really funny.

00:11:32.760 --> 00:11:35.760
 James, have you been to the center of the EU?

00:11:35.760 --> 00:11:37.760
 I don't know. Where is it?

00:11:37.760 --> 00:11:41.760
 Oh, yeah. The odds are astronomical.

00:11:41.760 --> 00:11:46.760
 But basically, there's a real problem with calculating the geographical center of the EU,

00:11:46.760 --> 00:11:50.760
 which is that the membership of the EU changes every few years.

00:11:50.760 --> 00:11:56.760
 So it used to be, in a particular place, then it changed in 1986 when Spain and Portugal joined.

00:11:56.760 --> 00:11:59.760
 Then in 1990, Germany was reunited and that shifted a little bit.

00:11:59.760 --> 00:12:03.760
 And so it keeps moving. It's just moved again due to Brexit.

00:12:03.760 --> 00:12:07.760
 And also, what did you do before Brexit? What did you do with the United Kingdom?

00:12:07.760 --> 00:12:10.760
 Do you just sell a taper onto France or do you include the bit in between?

00:12:10.760 --> 00:12:12.760
 Right. I can't remember.

00:12:12.760 --> 00:12:15.760
 And in fact, I suspect I never bothered to find out.

00:12:15.760 --> 00:12:18.760
 So where is the center then? Where is the current one, do you know?

00:12:18.760 --> 00:12:23.760
 Actually, I'm now looking at the one for Europe, which I think might be slightly different to the EU.

00:12:23.760 --> 00:12:29.760
 But the one for Europe is in Lithuania and it's got five reviews on TripAdvisor.

00:12:29.760 --> 00:12:35.760
 And they're all from James saying, "My wife was really pissed off."

00:12:35.760 --> 00:12:37.760
 Sort of ruined the whole experience.

00:12:37.760 --> 00:12:44.760
 The center of the EU, the new center is going to be, or is now, a field in Gadheim in Germany,

00:12:44.760 --> 00:12:50.760
 which has, they've already erected a red and white pole there and various flags flying all around it.

00:12:50.760 --> 00:12:52.760
 And in fact, they got really impatient.

00:12:52.760 --> 00:12:54.760
 There was an interview with, I think, the mayor of a nearby area saying,

00:12:54.760 --> 00:12:57.760
 "Because Britain took so long to figure out when it was leaving the EU,

00:12:57.760 --> 00:13:00.760
 and they're just desperate to announce themselves as the new middle."

00:13:00.760 --> 00:13:04.760
 They eventually erected a sign saying, "Future center of the EU."

00:13:04.760 --> 00:13:06.760
 Just to prepare people so it wasn't too much of a shock.

00:13:06.760 --> 00:13:09.760
 I was just thinking, right, bear with me.

00:13:09.760 --> 00:13:15.760
 If you wanted to influence an election, say a Brexit election,

00:13:15.760 --> 00:13:18.760
 then you might do a lot of online work.

00:13:18.760 --> 00:13:22.760
 So you might send a load of fake news and fake adverts and stuff like that.

00:13:22.760 --> 00:13:28.760
 And what would you need? You would need to find a lot of IP addresses to send all these things.

00:13:28.760 --> 00:13:32.760
 And who would have all those IP addresses, someone in the center of Europe,

00:13:32.760 --> 00:13:37.760
 and who has the motivation to want Brexit, the people who are in the center of Europe?

00:13:37.760 --> 00:13:43.760
 So you're saying it's the farmers of Gadheim who have clubbed together and swung the election for Brexit.

00:13:43.760 --> 00:13:44.760
 Exactly what I'm saying.

00:13:44.760 --> 00:13:48.760
 It's possible. That would be a great crime thriller.

00:13:48.760 --> 00:13:51.760
 I don't know if it would. I don't know if that's getting made.

00:13:51.760 --> 00:13:55.760
 They'll get the tourist boost, though. That's what they count on.

00:13:55.760 --> 00:13:57.760
 They think they'll be flooded.

00:13:57.760 --> 00:14:00.760
 But the warning comes from the previous center that's now been deposed,

00:14:00.760 --> 00:14:05.760
 which was somewhere else called Festingrand, where the local baker there said,

00:14:05.760 --> 00:14:09.760
 "We thought Chinese buses would be coming there every week when we became the center."

00:14:09.760 --> 00:14:12.760
 It didn't really turn out that way.

00:14:12.760 --> 00:14:18.760
 James, have you and Polina been to the center of the world?

00:14:18.760 --> 00:14:21.760
 Where is it? Is it in Russia?

00:14:21.760 --> 00:14:22.760
 It's in Ohio.

00:14:22.760 --> 00:14:24.760
 Oh, no. I haven't been to Ohio.

00:14:24.760 --> 00:14:25.760
 In America. What's that done?

00:14:25.760 --> 00:14:32.760
 Center of the world. It was set up by a sort of eccentric businessman called Randall Wilmot in 1845.

00:14:32.760 --> 00:14:34.760
 It's when he first moved to this area.

00:14:34.760 --> 00:14:36.760
 And he set up a business there.

00:14:36.760 --> 00:14:38.760
 He settled there. Some houses were built.

00:14:38.760 --> 00:14:42.760
 And he thought to get the attraction of people and give it a name.

00:14:42.760 --> 00:14:47.760
 He called it the center of the world, which I believe it's still called to this day.

00:14:47.760 --> 00:14:50.760
 And he just seems like a really fun character.

00:14:50.760 --> 00:14:56.760
 Before doing that, he lived in New York, where he had an establishment called the beginning of the world.

00:14:56.760 --> 00:15:00.760
 So when he left the beginning of the world, he went to the center of the world.

00:15:00.760 --> 00:15:03.760
 And he was there for a very long time.

00:15:03.760 --> 00:15:09.760
 And then eventually business dried up and he moved 13 miles away to Cortland in Ohio,

00:15:09.760 --> 00:15:13.760
 where he set up a grocery store called The End of the World.

00:15:13.760 --> 00:15:17.760
 And that was the last thing, major thing that he did.

00:15:17.760 --> 00:15:21.760
 So it's a guy who had in three places, the beginning, center and end of the world.

00:15:21.760 --> 00:15:25.760
 So he's saying that the end of the world is only 13 miles from the middle of the world.

00:15:25.760 --> 00:15:26.760
 Yes.

00:15:26.760 --> 00:15:31.760
 I don't know if those mathematical calculations are rigorous, as the previous ones.

00:15:31.760 --> 00:15:36.760
 This guy sounds like a distant ancestor of Bill Bender, I have to say.

00:15:36.760 --> 00:15:39.760
 Actually, you know what the roundest country on the planet is?

00:15:39.760 --> 00:15:40.760
 The roundest country on the planet.

00:15:40.760 --> 00:15:42.760
 I do know that. Is it Ivory Coast or something?

00:15:42.760 --> 00:15:44.760
 I don't think you do know.

00:15:44.760 --> 00:15:46.760
 Is it somewhere in Africa?

00:15:46.760 --> 00:15:49.760
 It's not Cote d'Ivoire, no. It's somewhere in Australia.

00:15:49.760 --> 00:15:50.760
 Oh, so close.

00:15:50.760 --> 00:15:52.760
 You were so close, isn't it?

00:15:52.760 --> 00:15:54.760
 So there are various different ways of working it out.

00:15:54.760 --> 00:15:56.760
 You can define rectangularity as well,

00:15:56.760 --> 00:15:59.760
 which is how much of a country overlaps with a rectangle of the same area.

00:15:59.760 --> 00:16:03.760
 And you might be able to get this one, the most rectangular country on the planet.

00:16:03.760 --> 00:16:07.760
 It's very rectangular. That's your clue.

00:16:07.760 --> 00:16:09.760
 Is it somewhere like Libya?

00:16:09.760 --> 00:16:11.760
 Oh, you're so close.

00:16:11.760 --> 00:16:12.760
 In that case, Egypt.

00:16:12.760 --> 00:16:14.760
 Yes, Egypt.

00:16:14.760 --> 00:16:16.760
 Oh, with the pyramids. That's amazing.

00:16:16.760 --> 00:16:17.760
 Me.

00:16:17.760 --> 00:16:18.760
 Yeah.

00:16:18.760 --> 00:16:22.760
 Well, no, it's just amazing that the sort of national shape that we know it

00:16:22.760 --> 00:16:23.760
 is the actual shape of the country.

00:16:23.760 --> 00:16:27.760
 Well, no, because the pyramids are more triangular than square, aren't they?

00:16:27.760 --> 00:16:30.760
 Dan, have you seen only half-built pyramids?

00:16:30.760 --> 00:16:32.760
 You're talking about ziggalaxes.

00:16:32.760 --> 00:16:34.760
 No, I thought we said...

00:16:34.760 --> 00:16:35.760
 Oh, what did you say?

00:16:35.760 --> 00:16:36.760
 You said rectangular.

00:16:36.760 --> 00:16:37.760
 I did.

00:16:37.760 --> 00:16:38.760
 Cool.

00:16:38.760 --> 00:16:39.760
 Nice.

00:16:39.760 --> 00:16:41.760
 It just sounds very similar to triangle, doesn't it?

00:16:41.760 --> 00:16:42.760
 It does.

00:16:42.760 --> 00:16:43.760
 They're very similar.

00:16:43.760 --> 00:16:44.760
 They're all the same, don't they?

00:16:44.760 --> 00:16:45.760
 Yeah.

00:16:45.760 --> 00:16:49.760
 It's amazing those primary school kids managed to gather this at all.

00:16:49.760 --> 00:16:55.760
 So, any chance the most triangular country is Egypt?

00:16:55.760 --> 00:16:56.760
 You've got the answer.

00:16:56.760 --> 00:16:57.760
 We'll look into it.

00:16:57.760 --> 00:16:58.760
 I'll get back to you guys.

00:16:58.760 --> 00:17:06.760
 OK, it's time for fact number two, and that is James.

00:17:06.760 --> 00:17:10.760
 OK, my fact this week is that the modern door handle was invented

00:17:10.760 --> 00:17:12.760
 by Ludwig Wittgenstein.

00:17:12.760 --> 00:17:13.760
 No.

00:17:13.760 --> 00:17:15.760
 It's my favourite fact ever.

00:17:15.760 --> 00:17:16.760
 I love it.

00:17:16.760 --> 00:17:17.760
 That's incredible.

00:17:17.760 --> 00:17:19.760
 I mean, he was quite recent.

00:17:19.760 --> 00:17:21.760
 Yeah, he was more recent than doors.

00:17:21.760 --> 00:17:22.760
 Yeah.

00:17:22.760 --> 00:17:25.760
 I thought no one could get through doors until he gave a lug.

00:17:25.760 --> 00:17:27.760
 They were just walls.

00:17:27.760 --> 00:17:29.760
 Just empty houses.

00:17:29.760 --> 00:17:32.760
 When you say the modern door handle, this is what fascinates me,

00:17:32.760 --> 00:17:36.760
 because it's as though there was a kind of archaic bad door handle,

00:17:36.760 --> 00:17:38.760
 and then he fixed it.

00:17:38.760 --> 00:17:40.760
 Well, that's kind of what happened.

00:17:40.760 --> 00:17:45.760
 So, Wittgenstein, philosopher, mid-20th century,

00:17:45.760 --> 00:17:49.760
 very well-renowned pupil of Bertrand Russell,

00:17:49.760 --> 00:17:52.760
 and kind of influenced pretty much everyone who came after him,

00:17:52.760 --> 00:17:56.760
 but also inventor of door handles.

00:17:56.760 --> 00:18:00.760
 Because I read this in an article about door handles

00:18:00.760 --> 00:18:02.760
 in Apollo Art Magazine.

00:18:02.760 --> 00:18:05.760
 And Wittgenstein was working as a school teacher,

00:18:05.760 --> 00:18:09.760
 and he'd hit one of the kids because they'd upset him.

00:18:09.760 --> 00:18:12.760
 And he'd had to kind of be taken out of the school

00:18:12.760 --> 00:18:14.760
 and be suspended and stuff like that.

00:18:14.760 --> 00:18:16.760
 I think he got fired, actually.

00:18:16.760 --> 00:18:19.760
 And so he kind of was sat around feeling sorry for himself,

00:18:19.760 --> 00:18:21.760
 didn't have anything to do,

00:18:21.760 --> 00:18:23.760
 but he came from an extremely rich family,

00:18:23.760 --> 00:18:26.760
 and his sister Gretel decided to distract him from everything

00:18:26.760 --> 00:18:29.760
 by commissioning him to design the interior of a new house

00:18:29.760 --> 00:18:31.760
 that she bought.

00:18:31.760 --> 00:18:33.760
 And he was extremely distracted by this

00:18:33.760 --> 00:18:37.760
 because it took him a year to design the door handle alone.

00:18:37.760 --> 00:18:40.760
 It took him two years to design the radiators.

00:18:40.760 --> 00:18:44.760
 But what he came up with was a really modern kind of,

00:18:44.760 --> 00:18:47.760
 I want to say, like minimalistic kind of design of a house.

00:18:47.760 --> 00:18:52.760
 And the door handle which he invented was kind of short,

00:18:52.760 --> 00:18:53.760
 coming out of the door,

00:18:53.760 --> 00:18:57.760
 and then a long, straight bit with a little kink in it.

00:18:57.760 --> 00:18:59.760
 If that's, it's not a great explanation,

00:18:59.760 --> 00:19:02.760
 but that's basically, if you look at a door handle now,

00:19:02.760 --> 00:19:04.760
 most of them will be that kind of design.

00:19:04.760 --> 00:19:07.760
 And until then it was more kind of knobs

00:19:07.760 --> 00:19:09.760
 or it was straight handles or stuff like that.

00:19:09.760 --> 00:19:13.760
 So all future door handles were kind of influenced by this one

00:19:13.760 --> 00:19:15.760
 that was invented by Wittgenstein.

00:19:15.760 --> 00:19:19.760
 In much the same way as all future philosophical thought

00:19:19.760 --> 00:19:21.760
 was influenced by him too.

00:19:21.760 --> 00:19:23.760
 I wonder how much that was seen.

00:19:23.760 --> 00:19:25.760
 You know, like he probably was asked to do a lot of talks

00:19:25.760 --> 00:19:27.760
 in the way that we have like Ted talks now.

00:19:27.760 --> 00:19:30.760
 And he'd always email back or write back at the time going,

00:19:30.760 --> 00:19:32.760
 do you want the philosophical chat

00:19:32.760 --> 00:19:35.760
 or the door handle lecture?

00:19:35.760 --> 00:19:36.760
 I've got both ready.

00:19:36.760 --> 00:19:38.760
 I think it was probably he'd be giving a talk

00:19:38.760 --> 00:19:40.760
 and there'd be questions and answers at the end.

00:19:40.760 --> 00:19:42.760
 And everyone only wanted to ask about the door handle.

00:19:42.760 --> 00:19:45.760
 I bet every time he'd be like, come on guys,

00:19:45.760 --> 00:19:47.760
 talk to your own philosophies.

00:19:47.760 --> 00:19:51.760
 It sounds really different to the house you grew up in.

00:19:51.760 --> 00:19:53.760
 So as James said, it's a very minimalist place,

00:19:53.760 --> 00:19:55.760
 this place in Vienna.

00:19:55.760 --> 00:19:57.760
 But the house he grew up in was, he grew up in a palace.

00:19:57.760 --> 00:19:59.760
 This was how wealthy his family were.

00:19:59.760 --> 00:20:02.760
 So the forecourt had sculptures in it by Rodin.

00:20:02.760 --> 00:20:04.760
 And there was someone who was employed in the house

00:20:04.760 --> 00:20:07.760
 for the sole purpose of bowing to visitors.

00:20:07.760 --> 00:20:09.760
 That's what I read, sole purpose.

00:20:09.760 --> 00:20:10.760
 Wow.

00:20:10.760 --> 00:20:11.760
 I know.

00:20:11.760 --> 00:20:13.760
 They had seven pianos this house.

00:20:13.760 --> 00:20:17.760
 It had an organ built in, had a fountain inside it.

00:20:17.760 --> 00:20:18.760
 Wow.

00:20:18.760 --> 00:20:20.760
 They did have, I think they had the largest private fortune

00:20:20.760 --> 00:20:21.760
 in Europe possibly.

00:20:21.760 --> 00:20:22.760
 He didn't know the Wittgensteins.

00:20:22.760 --> 00:20:23.760
 Wow.

00:20:23.760 --> 00:20:24.760
 Really?

00:20:24.760 --> 00:20:25.760
 They were loaded.

00:20:25.760 --> 00:20:26.760
 Yeah.

00:20:26.760 --> 00:20:27.760
 So he was really trying to simplify

00:20:27.760 --> 00:20:28.760
 when he designed this new house,

00:20:28.760 --> 00:20:31.760
 against the kind of incredibly opulent Viennese style.

00:20:31.760 --> 00:20:32.760
 Yeah.

00:20:32.760 --> 00:20:34.760
 I never thought of it that way about his previous house,

00:20:34.760 --> 00:20:36.760
 because when he moved to Trinity College,

00:20:36.760 --> 00:20:38.760
 after he became a famous philosopher,

00:20:38.760 --> 00:20:41.760
 his rooms were completely devoid of furniture.

00:20:41.760 --> 00:20:42.760
 He had no furniture in them.

00:20:42.760 --> 00:20:44.760
 And when he left Cambridge,

00:20:44.760 --> 00:20:47.760
 he became an assistant gardener at an Austrian monastery

00:20:47.760 --> 00:20:49.760
 and slept in a potting shed.

00:20:49.760 --> 00:20:53.760
 So maybe he was just trying to escape from that opulence.

00:20:53.760 --> 00:20:54.760
 Yeah.

00:20:54.760 --> 00:20:55.760
 Like I said.

00:20:55.760 --> 00:20:57.760
 Well, he gave all his money away as well, didn't he?

00:20:57.760 --> 00:20:58.760
 Yeah.

00:20:58.760 --> 00:20:59.760
 He inherited a lot,

00:20:59.760 --> 00:21:01.760
 and he just gave it to his brother's and sister.

00:21:01.760 --> 00:21:04.760
 And should have given it to the kid he was hitting at school,

00:21:04.760 --> 00:21:06.760
 which got him sacked from the job.

00:21:06.760 --> 00:21:08.760
 Well, to be honest, later on,

00:21:08.760 --> 00:21:13.760
 when he kind of had a bit of severe introspection after the war,

00:21:13.760 --> 00:21:15.760
 he kind of went to live in Norway,

00:21:15.760 --> 00:21:17.760
 and he did a lot of confessions.

00:21:17.760 --> 00:21:20.760
 So anything that happened to him previously in life,

00:21:20.760 --> 00:21:21.760
 which he felt bad about,

00:21:21.760 --> 00:21:24.760
 he went to those people and apologized for those things.

00:21:24.760 --> 00:21:27.760
 And he apologized to this,

00:21:27.760 --> 00:21:30.760
 at least to one of the children whose ears he had polled.

00:21:30.760 --> 00:21:31.760
 Did he?

00:21:31.760 --> 00:21:32.760
 Yeah.

00:21:32.760 --> 00:21:33.760
 She was called.

00:21:33.760 --> 00:21:35.760
 He was the original "My Name Is Earl".

00:21:35.760 --> 00:21:36.760
 Is that what that is?

00:21:36.760 --> 00:21:37.760
 Oh, yeah.

00:21:37.760 --> 00:21:39.760
 Yeah, you guys remember "My Name Is Earl", right?

00:21:39.760 --> 00:21:40.760
 No.

00:21:40.760 --> 00:21:42.760
 Is that TV series about that guy who committed loads of crimes

00:21:42.760 --> 00:21:44.760
 and then spent his life going back apologizing to them?

00:21:44.760 --> 00:21:46.760
 Well, it sounds like that's exactly what victims are.

00:21:46.760 --> 00:21:48.760
 I think it's based on this.

00:21:48.760 --> 00:21:50.760
 Sounds like "My Name Is Ludwig Wittgenstein".

00:21:50.760 --> 00:21:52.760
 And "My Father Is An Earl".

00:21:52.760 --> 00:21:57.760
 One of the reasons he became a teacher

00:21:57.760 --> 00:22:00.760
 was that he essentially gave up on philosophy, didn't he?

00:22:00.760 --> 00:22:05.760
 He wrote this thing called Tractatus logico philosophicus,

00:22:05.760 --> 00:22:08.760
 and it's a series of numbered bullet points.

00:22:08.760 --> 00:22:09.760
 It's not a...

00:22:09.760 --> 00:22:11.760
 Well, it's a tough read, I would say.

00:22:11.760 --> 00:22:12.760
 It's a dense read.

00:22:12.760 --> 00:22:13.760
 Tried to get through some of it.

00:22:13.760 --> 00:22:15.760
 He was very a man after our own hearts

00:22:15.760 --> 00:22:17.760
 because it opened with things like,

00:22:17.760 --> 00:22:19.760
 "The world divides into facts.

00:22:19.760 --> 00:22:21.760
 "The world is the totality of facts.

00:22:21.760 --> 00:22:23.760
 "The world is determined by facts.

00:22:23.760 --> 00:22:25.760
 "The facts in logical space are the world."

00:22:25.760 --> 00:22:27.760
 He sort of should be our mascot.

00:22:27.760 --> 00:22:28.760
 Wow.

00:22:28.760 --> 00:22:30.760
 But then he wrote this thing

00:22:30.760 --> 00:22:32.760
 with some impenetrable bullet points in it.

00:22:32.760 --> 00:22:34.760
 And then he believed that Tractatus had cleared up

00:22:34.760 --> 00:22:36.760
 all the confusions that had tormented philosophy

00:22:36.760 --> 00:22:37.760
 until that point.

00:22:37.760 --> 00:22:39.760
 And so he decided it was never necessary to write again.

00:22:39.760 --> 00:22:41.760
 And that was when he disappeared off to the Elps

00:22:41.760 --> 00:22:42.760
 after the First World War.

00:22:42.760 --> 00:22:44.760
 He's like, "I've solved philosophy

00:22:44.760 --> 00:22:47.760
 "now about these doors."

00:22:47.760 --> 00:22:49.760
 You're welcome.

00:22:49.760 --> 00:22:51.760
 Although then he decided against that

00:22:51.760 --> 00:22:53.760
 and I think went back to it by 1929

00:22:53.760 --> 00:22:55.760
 and wrote his other great work.

00:22:55.760 --> 00:22:58.760
 So he initially studied at Cambridge,

00:22:58.760 --> 00:23:00.760
 as James said, under Bertrand Russell.

00:23:00.760 --> 00:23:03.760
 And when he arrived there,

00:23:03.760 --> 00:23:06.760
 he seemed like a bit of a cocky dick

00:23:06.760 --> 00:23:08.760
 when it came to philosophies.

00:23:08.760 --> 00:23:11.760
 Like, as in, I'm surprised Russell didn't go,

00:23:11.760 --> 00:23:13.760
 "Get out of here," at some of the stuff he did.

00:23:13.760 --> 00:23:16.760
 I read an obituary that Russell wrote about him

00:23:16.760 --> 00:23:18.760
 and he describes his first encounter

00:23:18.760 --> 00:23:20.760
 and he says, "He maintained, for example,

00:23:20.760 --> 00:23:22.760
 "at one time that all existential propositions

00:23:22.760 --> 00:23:23.760
 "are meaningless.

00:23:23.760 --> 00:23:24.760
 "This was in a lecture room

00:23:24.760 --> 00:23:26.760
 "and I invited him to consider the proposition

00:23:26.760 --> 00:23:29.760
 "there is no hippopotamus in this room at present.

00:23:29.760 --> 00:23:31.760
 "When he refused to believe this,

00:23:31.760 --> 00:23:33.760
 "I looked under all the desks without finding one

00:23:33.760 --> 00:23:35.760
 "but he remained unconvinced."

00:23:35.760 --> 00:23:37.760
 I mean, if I tried to pull that on you guys,

00:23:37.760 --> 00:23:39.760
 you'd kick me out of the room, right?

00:23:39.760 --> 00:23:40.760
 It's true. Like, it was...

00:23:40.760 --> 00:23:42.760
 Do you remember that time you tried to convince us

00:23:42.760 --> 00:23:44.760
 that rectangles and rectangles were the same thing?

00:23:44.760 --> 00:23:49.760
 Oh, that's true. I've still got a job.

00:23:49.760 --> 00:23:51.760
 Yeah, maybe.

00:23:51.760 --> 00:23:55.760
 Isn't there a story about Vic Constine and Russell?

00:23:55.760 --> 00:23:56.760
 I might be wrong about this

00:23:56.760 --> 00:23:57.760
 because I haven't written it down,

00:23:57.760 --> 00:23:59.760
 but did he not go to Cambridge

00:23:59.760 --> 00:24:01.760
 and Russell said,

00:24:01.760 --> 00:24:03.760
 "Tell me why I should take you on as a student,"

00:24:03.760 --> 00:24:05.760
 and he gave him a piece of paper

00:24:05.760 --> 00:24:08.760
 with one sentence or one word written on it or something

00:24:08.760 --> 00:24:10.760
 and Russell looked at it

00:24:10.760 --> 00:24:12.760
 and then kind of threw it away

00:24:12.760 --> 00:24:14.760
 but gave him the job based on that,

00:24:14.760 --> 00:24:16.760
 and no one knows what was on that piece of paper.

00:24:16.760 --> 00:24:18.760
 I think that's true. Wow.

00:24:18.760 --> 00:24:20.760
 That's the story, yeah.

00:24:20.760 --> 00:24:23.760
 It's probably a drawing of a door handle or something.

00:24:23.760 --> 00:24:27.760
 Yeah, that is the story.

00:24:27.760 --> 00:24:29.760
 I don't know if it's apocryphal, but...

00:24:29.760 --> 00:24:30.760
 It sounds it, does it? Yeah.

00:24:30.760 --> 00:24:32.760
 He had such a full life.

00:24:32.760 --> 00:24:34.760
 It's amazing. I mean, he fought in the First World War,

00:24:34.760 --> 00:24:35.760
 which we haven't even mentioned,

00:24:35.760 --> 00:24:38.760
 as, I guess, loads of men of that age had done.

00:24:38.760 --> 00:24:42.760
 He also had been an engineer before being a philosopher,

00:24:42.760 --> 00:24:45.760
 so he built an aeronautical engine,

00:24:45.760 --> 00:24:47.760
 which actually proved useful

00:24:47.760 --> 00:24:49.760
 when helicopters were being designed later on.

00:24:49.760 --> 00:24:52.760
 And so this is a really, really, really full life he had.

00:24:52.760 --> 00:24:54.760
 Yeah, and he was a genius,

00:24:54.760 --> 00:24:56.760
 but he's basically the philosopher's philosopher, isn't he?

00:24:56.760 --> 00:24:57.760
 Like all other philosophers said,

00:24:57.760 --> 00:24:59.760
 "This is the smartest guy you've ever met, guys."

00:24:59.760 --> 00:25:02.760
 So maybe he was justified in that arrogance,

00:25:02.760 --> 00:25:05.760
 but in his lectures, he used to throw students out

00:25:05.760 --> 00:25:08.760
 when they didn't insult him, basically.

00:25:08.760 --> 00:25:11.760
 So if students didn't ask him pertinent questions

00:25:11.760 --> 00:25:13.760
 or lay into him about his arguments,

00:25:13.760 --> 00:25:14.760
 he'd kick them out of the lectures,

00:25:14.760 --> 00:25:16.760
 and at one point, there was just one person

00:25:16.760 --> 00:25:17.760
 left in his lecture at the inn,

00:25:17.760 --> 00:25:18.760
 because he'd kicked everyone else out

00:25:18.760 --> 00:25:20.760
 for being too stupid and accepting.

00:25:20.760 --> 00:25:21.760
 Wow.

00:25:21.760 --> 00:25:23.760
 And that was actually a guy called Francis Skinner,

00:25:23.760 --> 00:25:27.760
 with whom he planned to emigrate to the Soviet Union in 1934.

00:25:27.760 --> 00:25:29.760
 He wanted to become a manual laborer.

00:25:29.760 --> 00:25:30.760
 What?

00:25:30.760 --> 00:25:32.760
 And he, in fact, visited the Soviet Union

00:25:32.760 --> 00:25:34.760
 to kind of do a recce of it and be like,

00:25:34.760 --> 00:25:36.760
 "Is this place good for manual labor?"

00:25:36.760 --> 00:25:38.760
 And he came back and decided against it.

00:25:38.760 --> 00:25:39.760
 Very well.

00:25:39.760 --> 00:25:41.760
 As I think you would if you were considering manual labor

00:25:41.760 --> 00:25:43.760
 in the USSR in 1934.

00:25:43.760 --> 00:25:45.760
 There's another reason why he was a man

00:25:45.760 --> 00:25:47.760
 after our own hearts, I think,

00:25:47.760 --> 00:25:50.760
 because one of his famous things that he wrote was,

00:25:50.760 --> 00:25:51.760
 "If a lion could speak,

00:25:51.760 --> 00:25:53.760
 we would not be able to understand him."

00:25:53.760 --> 00:25:55.760
 And what he means by that, basically,

00:25:55.760 --> 00:25:58.760
 is that you can translate one human language

00:25:58.760 --> 00:26:00.760
 to another human language, and that's fine,

00:26:00.760 --> 00:26:02.760
 because we've all had the same kind of life.

00:26:02.760 --> 00:26:04.760
 We all have the same experiences.

00:26:04.760 --> 00:26:06.760
 We all feel the same. We all smell the same.

00:26:06.760 --> 00:26:07.760
 We all see the same.

00:26:07.760 --> 00:26:10.760
 And so it's easy to translate those words to other words.

00:26:10.760 --> 00:26:14.760
 But with lions, we just do not know what it's like being a lion.

00:26:14.760 --> 00:26:16.760
 And if they could tell us stuff,

00:26:16.760 --> 00:26:18.760
 we just wouldn't understand the single thing they were saying.

00:26:18.760 --> 00:26:20.760
 And it was a point he was making about language.

00:26:20.760 --> 00:26:22.760
 But it's the point that I always make,

00:26:22.760 --> 00:26:24.760
 that a lion doesn't even know it's a lion.

00:26:24.760 --> 00:26:26.760
 Don't try and pass yourself off

00:26:26.760 --> 00:26:28.760
 with the heir to the great philosophy of the 20th century.

00:26:28.760 --> 00:26:30.760
 We see you.

00:26:30.760 --> 00:26:34.760
 Can we talk a bit about his family as well?

00:26:34.760 --> 00:26:36.760
 So I'm sure you guys came across this book,

00:26:36.760 --> 00:26:38.760
 "The House of Wittgenstein,"

00:26:38.760 --> 00:26:41.760
 which is a book about the entire clan.

00:26:41.760 --> 00:26:43.760
 And it sounds insane.

00:26:43.760 --> 00:26:46.760
 I mean, the book sounds remarkable, but the family also,

00:26:46.760 --> 00:26:48.760
 they were dreadfully unhappy as people.

00:26:48.760 --> 00:26:50.760
 So he was one of five brothers,

00:26:50.760 --> 00:26:52.760
 three of whom took their own lives,

00:26:52.760 --> 00:26:54.760
 and the other two of whom seriously considered it.

00:26:54.760 --> 00:26:58.760
 So the two brothers who didn't were Ludwig and Paul.

00:26:58.760 --> 00:27:01.760
 And Paul was an amazing...

00:27:01.760 --> 00:27:05.760
 He was a pianist who lost an arm during the First World War,

00:27:05.760 --> 00:27:09.760
 but stayed as a pianist, a one-armed pianist.

00:27:09.760 --> 00:27:13.760
 And he commissioned one-handed works from lots and lots of composers.

00:27:13.760 --> 00:27:16.760
 So Strauss, Prokofiev, Britton, Ravel,

00:27:16.760 --> 00:27:18.760
 which could have been a really nice tool

00:27:18.760 --> 00:27:20.760
 for other pianists with one arm.

00:27:20.760 --> 00:27:24.760
 But he declined permission to other one-armed pianists

00:27:24.760 --> 00:27:26.760
 to actually play the pieces.

00:27:26.760 --> 00:27:28.760
 This is the worst thing.

00:27:28.760 --> 00:27:30.760
 Even if he couldn't play them himself,

00:27:30.760 --> 00:27:32.760
 because he found them difficult,

00:27:32.760 --> 00:27:34.760
 he would not let other people have a go.

00:27:34.760 --> 00:27:36.760
 He wrote back to Prokofiev,

00:27:36.760 --> 00:27:38.760
 "Thank you for your concerto,

00:27:38.760 --> 00:27:40.760
 but I do not understand a single note,

00:27:40.760 --> 00:27:42.760
 and I shall not play it."

00:27:42.760 --> 00:27:45.760
 But he was, because they came from a rich family,

00:27:45.760 --> 00:27:47.760
 they were all kind of spoiled brats in a way,

00:27:47.760 --> 00:27:49.760
 except Wittgenstein, who it seems eschewed all that.

00:27:49.760 --> 00:27:52.760
 So Paul eventually had to flee to America

00:27:52.760 --> 00:27:54.760
 because he had impregnated this woman

00:27:54.760 --> 00:27:56.760
 who had a piano lesson, in fact, that he was giving her.

00:27:56.760 --> 00:27:58.760
 And so he fled to America.

00:27:58.760 --> 00:28:00.760
 Sorry, during the first piano lesson, he got her pregnant.

00:28:00.760 --> 00:28:02.760
 He should have been just practicing his fingering.

00:28:02.760 --> 00:28:04.760
 [LAUGHS]

00:28:04.760 --> 00:28:10.760
 So he played the piano differently then.

00:28:10.760 --> 00:28:12.760
 I had so many piano lessons.

00:28:12.760 --> 00:28:14.760
 I mean, not once did you get pregnant.

00:28:14.760 --> 00:28:16.760
 I didn't.

00:28:16.760 --> 00:28:20.760
 So he impregnated this student, fled to America,

00:28:20.760 --> 00:28:23.760
 and he didn't have a valid once he was in America,

00:28:23.760 --> 00:28:25.760
 which he wasn't used to, he didn't know how to live without that.

00:28:25.760 --> 00:28:27.760
 So, for instance, he was staying in a hotel,

00:28:27.760 --> 00:28:29.760
 and he just took off all his clothes

00:28:29.760 --> 00:28:31.760
 and left them outside the door of the hotel,

00:28:31.760 --> 00:28:33.760
 assuming that a valid would come and wash them

00:28:33.760 --> 00:28:35.760
 and return them to him, and they all got stolen.

00:28:35.760 --> 00:28:37.760
 And so...

00:28:37.760 --> 00:28:39.760
 Wait, surely outside the door of his room,

00:28:39.760 --> 00:28:41.760
 not outside the door of the hotel.

00:28:41.760 --> 00:28:43.760
 It's also outside the door of his room.

00:28:43.760 --> 00:28:45.760
 Can I also say, if he decided he wanted to get his clothes

00:28:45.760 --> 00:28:47.760
 washed by a hotel every single time,

00:28:47.760 --> 00:28:50.760
 then he would have lost the entire family fortune,

00:28:50.760 --> 00:28:53.760
 within about three weeks, if your experience is anything to go by.

00:28:53.760 --> 00:28:56.760
 Yeah, look, let's not revisit my hotel bill

00:28:56.760 --> 00:28:58.760
 from our US tour last year.

00:28:58.760 --> 00:29:01.760
 It is a great way to lose your entire family fortune.

00:29:01.760 --> 00:29:03.760
 So reason the tour lost money.

00:29:03.760 --> 00:29:08.760
 But he sat around wearing bedsheets.

00:29:08.760 --> 00:29:10.760
 He just wore a sheet over himself

00:29:10.760 --> 00:29:12.760
 until someone eventually sort of heard about it

00:29:12.760 --> 00:29:14.760
 and said, "Shot me to be your PA,

00:29:14.760 --> 00:29:16.760
 'cause it seems you don't know how to live in the world."

00:29:16.760 --> 00:29:18.760
 And she was hired.

00:29:18.760 --> 00:29:20.760
 And there was another anecdote about him

00:29:20.760 --> 00:29:22.760
 walking out into the street and someone had given him a hat.

00:29:22.760 --> 00:29:24.760
 And he was wearing the hat,

00:29:24.760 --> 00:29:26.760
 but it was still attached to its hat box.

00:29:26.760 --> 00:29:28.760
 'Cause he didn't know,

00:29:28.760 --> 00:29:30.760
 I guess, how to put on his own hat?

00:29:30.760 --> 00:29:32.760
 Wow, that is posh.

00:29:32.760 --> 00:29:34.760
 What about Gretel, we mentioned her earlier,

00:29:34.760 --> 00:29:36.760
 who was the person who bought the house

00:29:36.760 --> 00:29:38.760
 which Wittgenstein designed?

00:29:38.760 --> 00:29:41.760
 She found it by following a trail of sweets to the door, didn't she?

00:29:41.760 --> 00:29:47.760
 So Gretel was the subject of a portrait by Gustav Klimt,

00:29:47.760 --> 00:29:49.760
 and, you know, Klimt

00:29:49.760 --> 00:29:51.760
 one of the greatest artists of the early 20th century,

00:29:51.760 --> 00:29:53.760
 but she just hated it,

00:29:53.760 --> 00:29:55.760
 and so she just kept it in her attic.

00:29:55.760 --> 00:29:57.760
 I mean, you know,

00:29:57.760 --> 00:29:59.760
 fancy having your portrait drawn by Klimt

00:29:59.760 --> 00:30:01.760
 and then just thinking, "I don't like it very much."

00:30:01.760 --> 00:30:03.760
 Have we, is it out of the attic yet?

00:30:03.760 --> 00:30:05.760
 Do we know what it's like?

00:30:05.760 --> 00:30:07.760
 Maybe he was having a really bad day.

00:30:07.760 --> 00:30:09.760
 No, it's good, I think it's good.

00:30:09.760 --> 00:30:11.760
 I mean, she has quite a long neck in it, but...

00:30:11.760 --> 00:30:13.760
 That might be.

00:30:13.760 --> 00:30:15.760
 Not the Diddlyani long,

00:30:15.760 --> 00:30:17.760
 just like it's slightly longer than a normal person's neck.

00:30:17.760 --> 00:30:19.760
 She's still fitting into...

00:30:19.760 --> 00:30:21.760
 onto the canvas, right?

00:30:21.760 --> 00:30:23.760
 It's not such a long neck.

00:30:23.760 --> 00:30:25.760
 She had to chop off the top of her head.

00:30:25.760 --> 00:30:27.760
 She had to chop off the hat box at the top.

00:30:27.760 --> 00:30:31.760
 She wasn't very nice, I don't think.

00:30:31.760 --> 00:30:33.760
 Well, she was a bit of a Nazi, wasn't she?

00:30:33.760 --> 00:30:35.760
 In fact, both the sisters were a bit...

00:30:35.760 --> 00:30:37.760
 had Nazi tendencies, and in fact,

00:30:37.760 --> 00:30:39.760
 sided with the fascists against Paul

00:30:39.760 --> 00:30:41.760
 and gave away a lot of their fortune to the Nazis.

00:30:41.760 --> 00:30:43.760
 And they all kind of hated each other, the siblings.

00:30:43.760 --> 00:30:45.760
 They ended up variously estranged from each other,

00:30:45.760 --> 00:30:47.760
 as well as all sort of committing suicide.

00:30:47.760 --> 00:30:49.760
 It's a very sad family.

00:30:49.760 --> 00:30:51.760
 There was a lot of, obviously,

00:30:51.760 --> 00:30:53.760
 there was a lot of Nazism about at the time.

00:30:53.760 --> 00:30:55.760
 Ludwig was actually a classmate of Adolf Hitler's.

00:30:55.760 --> 00:30:57.760
 No. Yeah.

00:30:57.760 --> 00:30:59.760
 Was he? Wow. He was.

00:30:59.760 --> 00:31:01.760
 They were at the same age and they were at the same school,

00:31:01.760 --> 00:31:03.760
 but Wittgenstein was put forward a year

00:31:03.760 --> 00:31:05.760
 and Hitler was taken back a year.

00:31:05.760 --> 00:31:07.760
 Dodged a bullet.

00:31:07.760 --> 00:31:09.760
 So... Hitler was taken back a year?

00:31:09.760 --> 00:31:11.760
 Yeah, yeah. Oh, wow.

00:31:11.760 --> 00:31:13.760
 So they ended up two years apart.

00:31:13.760 --> 00:31:15.760
 Yeah, exactly, even though they're the same age.

00:31:15.760 --> 00:31:17.760
 So they probably wouldn't have known each other.

00:31:17.760 --> 00:31:19.760
 No, they knew each other. It was a small school.

00:31:19.760 --> 00:31:21.760
 Small schools. Oh, OK. That was embarrassing for Hitler.

00:31:21.760 --> 00:31:23.760
 That's like Dom Jollien or Summer bin Laden.

00:31:23.760 --> 00:31:25.760
 Yeah. They were at the same school.

00:31:25.760 --> 00:31:27.760
 Dom Jollien and Summer bin Laden went to the same school.

00:31:27.760 --> 00:31:29.760
 Yeah, they went to the same school.

00:31:29.760 --> 00:31:31.760
 I can see that you're kind of putting Osama bin Laden

00:31:31.760 --> 00:31:33.760
 and Hitler in the same bracket,

00:31:33.760 --> 00:31:35.760
 but Dom Jollien, Ludwig Wittgenstein, I'm not...

00:31:35.760 --> 00:31:37.760
 I mean, he's a great comedian, but...

00:31:37.760 --> 00:31:39.760
 Trigger Happy TV is the track artist

00:31:39.760 --> 00:31:41.760
 and Roger Koch is the author because of its date,

00:31:41.760 --> 00:31:43.760
 in my opinion.

00:31:43.760 --> 00:31:45.760
 He was another one who recorded when he masturbated.

00:31:45.760 --> 00:31:47.760
 Oh, good.

00:31:47.760 --> 00:31:49.760
 Wittgenstein.

00:31:49.760 --> 00:31:51.760
 Before I think.

00:31:51.760 --> 00:31:53.760
 Who did we mention had done it in a previous episode?

00:31:53.760 --> 00:31:55.760
 Was it Hook?

00:31:55.760 --> 00:31:57.760
 Yes, that's it.

00:31:57.760 --> 00:31:59.760
 But Wittgenstein continued that tradition

00:31:59.760 --> 00:32:01.760
 and he wrote in his diary during World War I.

00:32:01.760 --> 00:32:03.760
 He would write in his diary when he'd masturbated.

00:32:03.760 --> 00:32:05.760
 And actually, this is a...

00:32:05.760 --> 00:32:07.760
 I couldn't find a verification of this

00:32:07.760 --> 00:32:09.760
 but I think we trust him.

00:32:09.760 --> 00:32:11.760
 And he said that Wittgenstein used to get annoyed

00:32:11.760 --> 00:32:13.760
 because his fantasies while he was masturbating

00:32:13.760 --> 00:32:15.760
 kept on being plagued by mass problems.

00:32:15.760 --> 00:32:17.760
 And he found this very annoying.

00:32:17.760 --> 00:32:19.760
 Distracting. I think it's a problem that we've all had.

00:32:19.760 --> 00:32:23.760
 He wouldn't be the first person to be thinking about an ex.

00:32:23.760 --> 00:32:27.760
 Very strong. Wonderful.

00:32:27.760 --> 00:32:36.760
 OK, it is time for fact number three, and that is Andy.

00:32:36.760 --> 00:32:38.760
 My fact is that in 1801,

00:32:38.760 --> 00:32:42.760
 England had a celebrity ox which had its own coach and horses.

00:32:42.760 --> 00:32:44.760
 Amazing.

00:32:44.760 --> 00:32:47.760
 Yeah, so this is from a great book

00:32:47.760 --> 00:32:50.760
 called Jane Austen's Country Life by Deirdre Le Fay,

00:32:50.760 --> 00:32:52.760
 which is all about life in rural England

00:32:52.760 --> 00:32:54.760
 in the early 19th century.

00:32:54.760 --> 00:32:58.760
 And there was this ox which had been bred

00:32:58.760 --> 00:33:02.760
 by a man called Charles Colling of Kettenhall in Durham.

00:33:02.760 --> 00:33:05.760
 And it was known as the Kettenhawks at first,

00:33:05.760 --> 00:33:08.760
 and then it was renamed, so it became the Durham ox.

00:33:08.760 --> 00:33:10.760
 And Colling was interested in cattle breeding,

00:33:10.760 --> 00:33:12.760
 and he was one of the pioneers of breeding animals

00:33:12.760 --> 00:33:14.760
 to make them really, really big.

00:33:14.760 --> 00:33:18.760
 And the Durham ox was a huge success,

00:33:18.760 --> 00:33:21.760
 and I mean that in every sense.

00:33:21.760 --> 00:33:28.760
 It was reported as being between 170 stone and 270 stone.

00:33:28.760 --> 00:33:30.760
 Stones weren't standardized at the time,

00:33:30.760 --> 00:33:34.760
 but it was well over 1,000 kilos, this bull.

00:33:34.760 --> 00:33:38.760
 And it was about four times the size of a modern cow, basically.

00:33:38.760 --> 00:33:39.760
 It was really big.

00:33:39.760 --> 00:33:41.760
 It was impressive. It sounds impressive.

00:33:41.760 --> 00:33:43.760
 Because cows are big already. They're quite big.

00:33:43.760 --> 00:33:44.760
 Cows are big.

00:33:44.760 --> 00:33:46.760
 Yeah, it's interesting because now there's a lot of pressure

00:33:46.760 --> 00:33:48.760
 on celebrities to lose weight,

00:33:48.760 --> 00:33:50.760
 but it sounds like back in the day,

00:33:50.760 --> 00:33:53.760
 there was a lot of pressure on celebrities to be as heavy as possible.

00:33:53.760 --> 00:33:54.760
 That's very true.

00:33:54.760 --> 00:33:55.760
 So that's something that's changed,

00:33:55.760 --> 00:33:58.760
 as well as the fact that celebrities have cows back today.

00:33:58.760 --> 00:34:00.760
 Can I just say a fact about a celebrity animal?

00:34:00.760 --> 00:34:02.760
 Because I was going to do this as my fact next week,

00:34:02.760 --> 00:34:05.760
 but I think I'll say it now anyway to see what happens.

00:34:05.760 --> 00:34:09.760
 In the third series of French Big Brother,

00:34:09.760 --> 00:34:13.760
 one of the housemates was a dog.

00:34:13.760 --> 00:34:14.760
 Really?

00:34:14.760 --> 00:34:16.760
 And it was a dog called Saucisse.

00:34:16.760 --> 00:34:20.760
 And part of the rules were you had to have a secret,

00:34:20.760 --> 00:34:23.760
 and all of the housemates had to work out what your secret was.

00:34:23.760 --> 00:34:27.760
 And Saucisse's secret was that he once ran for the mayor of Marseille.

00:34:27.760 --> 00:34:30.760
 And did he spill it on the first day?

00:34:30.760 --> 00:34:36.760
 Did they have to work out what the secret was, did you say?

00:34:36.760 --> 00:34:38.760
 Yeah, they had to work out each other's secrets.

00:34:38.760 --> 00:34:43.760
 That is absolutely impossible to work out from what the dog's giving you.

00:34:43.760 --> 00:34:46.760
 I know what you mean, but Saucisse, the dog,

00:34:46.760 --> 00:34:49.760
 doesn't really have an ability to form complex thoughts.

00:34:49.760 --> 00:34:51.760
 So he's also a disadvantage.

00:34:51.760 --> 00:34:53.760
 Well, it's like Vik Gunnstein said.

00:34:53.760 --> 00:34:55.760
 He said, "If Saucisse the dog could talk,

00:34:55.760 --> 00:35:00.760
 we wouldn't understand his platform to be the mayor of Marseille."

00:35:00.760 --> 00:35:01.760
 Sorry, Andy.

00:35:01.760 --> 00:35:02.760
 We should talk about the arcs.

00:35:02.760 --> 00:35:07.760
 No, actually, genuinely, I'm quite interested in talking more about Saucisse.

00:35:07.760 --> 00:35:08.760
 Where did he place?

00:35:08.760 --> 00:35:10.760
 Where did he place in the final?

00:35:10.760 --> 00:35:11.760
 I can't remember.

00:35:11.760 --> 00:35:16.760
 I haven't done the research on it because it isn't one of my facts yet for the show.

00:35:16.760 --> 00:35:20.760
 So, anyway, that's now comparatively dull ox,

00:35:20.760 --> 00:35:24.760
 which never, as far as I can tell, ran for elected office anywhere, lazy.

00:35:24.760 --> 00:35:28.760
 But it was bought by a man called John Day for a couple of hundred quid.

00:35:28.760 --> 00:35:33.760
 And it had a special carriage, and it was pulled around by four horses.

00:35:33.760 --> 00:35:36.760
 It toured England and Scotland for five years.

00:35:36.760 --> 00:35:40.760
 It played 200 different venues across the UK.

00:35:40.760 --> 00:35:41.760
 It's amazing.

00:35:41.760 --> 00:35:43.760
 Many more gigs than we have done as a podcast.

00:35:43.760 --> 00:35:44.760
 Put it that way.

00:35:44.760 --> 00:35:46.760
 Yeah, it played international gigs as well.

00:35:46.760 --> 00:35:49.760
 It played Madison Square Garden, which it did.

00:35:49.760 --> 00:35:50.760
 Exactly.

00:35:50.760 --> 00:35:51.760
 It played Madison Square Garden.

00:35:51.760 --> 00:35:52.760
 So a couple of weeks ago.

00:35:52.760 --> 00:35:53.760
 Hang on.

00:35:53.760 --> 00:35:56.760
 I've mixed up my famous celebrity oxes.

00:35:56.760 --> 00:35:57.760
 Yeah.

00:35:57.760 --> 00:35:58.760
 It was a different ox.

00:35:58.760 --> 00:35:59.760
 Very sorry.

00:35:59.760 --> 00:36:00.760
 Back out on that one.

00:36:00.760 --> 00:36:01.760
 OK.

00:36:01.760 --> 00:36:03.760
 I can't wait to hear about this other celebrity ox.

00:36:03.760 --> 00:36:06.760
 That's a spoiler for later in the show, yeah.

00:36:06.760 --> 00:36:09.760
 It wasn't just size that it was renowned for.

00:36:09.760 --> 00:36:11.760
 You can't just be big.

00:36:11.760 --> 00:36:13.760
 It was also symmetry, apparently.

00:36:13.760 --> 00:36:14.760
 They're the two attributes.

00:36:14.760 --> 00:36:16.760
 And if you look at news articles from the time,

00:36:16.760 --> 00:36:18.760
 it's always about its size and its symmetry.

00:36:18.760 --> 00:36:21.760
 So you had to be balanced on each side.

00:36:21.760 --> 00:36:24.760
 And it was, bulls would be advertised as having been

00:36:24.760 --> 00:36:26.760
 sired by the Durham ox, wouldn't they?

00:36:26.760 --> 00:36:28.760
 And there was sort of like a type of ox

00:36:28.760 --> 00:36:30.760
 that was called Durham ox after this.

00:36:30.760 --> 00:36:34.760
 He was so famous that he became his own breed, I suppose.

00:36:34.760 --> 00:36:38.760
 Well, do you know about the breeding of his parentage?

00:36:38.760 --> 00:36:39.760
 Please tell us.

00:36:39.760 --> 00:36:41.760
 It's very incest heavy.

00:36:41.760 --> 00:36:44.760
 This honestly makes Game of Thrones look like Rosie and Jim.

00:36:44.760 --> 00:36:47.760
 So there was a bull called Favourite,

00:36:47.760 --> 00:36:49.760
 who was bred with his own mother.

00:36:49.760 --> 00:36:51.760
 His mother was called Phoenix.

00:36:51.760 --> 00:36:53.760
 They produced a cow who was called Young Phoenix.

00:36:53.760 --> 00:36:55.760
 So Favourite had been bred with his own mum

00:36:55.760 --> 00:36:58.760
 to produce his daughter/sister, Young Phoenix.

00:36:58.760 --> 00:37:01.760
 But then Favourite was bred with his own daughter/sister,

00:37:01.760 --> 00:37:04.760
 Young Phoenix, to produce the Durham ox.

00:37:04.760 --> 00:37:08.760
 So as far as I can tell, the Durham ox's dad was his grandfather

00:37:08.760 --> 00:37:10.760
 and his mum was his half-sister.

00:37:10.760 --> 00:37:13.760
 Yeah. Or you could say that Young Phoenix was simultaneously

00:37:13.760 --> 00:37:16.760
 Favourite's daughter/sister and sexual partner.

00:37:16.760 --> 00:37:18.760
 Oh, boy.

00:37:18.760 --> 00:37:19.760
 Nice.

00:37:19.760 --> 00:37:21.760
 Well, it saves on giving presents a Christmas time, doesn't it?

00:37:21.760 --> 00:37:25.760
 What are you going to get?

00:37:25.760 --> 00:37:28.760
 Your daughter/sister mum and sexual partner.

00:37:28.760 --> 00:37:30.760
 Probably just going to a necklace.

00:37:30.760 --> 00:37:32.760
 It worked in breeding.

00:37:32.760 --> 00:37:35.760
 I mean, if what you're going for is massive cow,

00:37:35.760 --> 00:37:37.760
 then it did well.

00:37:37.760 --> 00:37:39.760
 You didn't want to get any genes involved that were inferior.

00:37:39.760 --> 00:37:40.760
 True.

00:37:40.760 --> 00:37:42.760
 And I think it was pioneered first by a guy called Robert Bakewell,

00:37:42.760 --> 00:37:45.760
 who was this massive guy in the agricultural revolution

00:37:45.760 --> 00:37:48.760
 who sort of made all his cows chag each other

00:37:48.760 --> 00:37:50.760
 within their own families.

00:37:50.760 --> 00:37:53.760
 And he revolutionised selective breeding, really.

00:37:53.760 --> 00:37:55.760
 And Darwin cited him quite a lot.

00:37:55.760 --> 00:37:57.760
 And he was incredible at building cows

00:37:57.760 --> 00:38:00.760
 to the ideal size and shape.

00:38:00.760 --> 00:38:03.760
 The Durham ox has an entire town in Australia named after it.

00:38:03.760 --> 00:38:04.760
 It's called Durham Ox.

00:38:04.760 --> 00:38:06.760
 It's got 74 people living there.

00:38:06.760 --> 00:38:09.760
 And I went on the Australia's Guide website,

00:38:09.760 --> 00:38:12.760
 which says there is one thing to do within 20 kilometres,

00:38:12.760 --> 00:38:15.760
 and that thing is a jumper shop.

00:38:15.760 --> 00:38:17.760
 So it's quiet.

00:38:17.760 --> 00:38:18.760
 Did you say a jumper shop?

00:38:18.760 --> 00:38:19.760
 Yeah.

00:38:19.760 --> 00:38:20.760
 It's in a shop that sells jumpers.

00:38:20.760 --> 00:38:21.760
 Sorry.

00:38:21.760 --> 00:38:24.760
 The jumper shop is the nearest local attraction.

00:38:24.760 --> 00:38:29.760
 But it's the safest place to live in the state of Victoria.

00:38:29.760 --> 00:38:34.760
 So in 2015, the news reported that there had been just seven crimes

00:38:34.760 --> 00:38:36.760
 in five years.

00:38:36.760 --> 00:38:37.760
 Wow.

00:38:37.760 --> 00:38:39.760
 This is how it broke down.

00:38:39.760 --> 00:38:40.760
 2014.

00:38:40.760 --> 00:38:43.760
 There was no jumper theft, as far as I can tell.

00:38:43.760 --> 00:38:45.760
 2014, there was an arson thing.

00:38:45.760 --> 00:38:47.760
 That was quite a serious crime.

00:38:47.760 --> 00:38:49.760
 2013, no crimes.

00:38:49.760 --> 00:38:51.760
 2012, no crimes.

00:38:51.760 --> 00:38:54.760
 2011, there was one drug offence.

00:38:54.760 --> 00:38:57.760
 But in 2010, there was an abduction.

00:38:57.760 --> 00:38:58.760
 There was arson.

00:38:58.760 --> 00:39:00.760
 There was a weapon and explosives offence.

00:39:00.760 --> 00:39:03.760
 And there were two counts of disorderly and offensive conduct.

00:39:03.760 --> 00:39:06.760
 It sounds like the biggest year in Durham Oaks's history ever.

00:39:06.760 --> 00:39:09.760
 But wait, was that all one event?

00:39:09.760 --> 00:39:11.760
 Kind of like, "This is my sister, I love her."

00:39:11.760 --> 00:39:16.760
 Didn't mention any incest-related crimes.

00:39:16.760 --> 00:39:22.760
 Do you know what the second most safe place in Victoria is?

00:39:22.760 --> 00:39:23.760
 No.

00:39:23.760 --> 00:39:25.760
 I thought I might as well check it out.

00:39:25.760 --> 00:39:27.760
 You really go the extra mile.

00:39:27.760 --> 00:39:28.760
 This is brilliant.

00:39:28.760 --> 00:39:31.760
 So this is a place called Speed.

00:39:31.760 --> 00:39:34.760
 Okay, so again, they've had very, very few crimes.

00:39:34.760 --> 00:39:35.760
 It's a very small place.

00:39:35.760 --> 00:39:39.760
 But one thing that they did used to have a problem with was speeding,

00:39:39.760 --> 00:39:43.760
 because when you drive into speed, it's on a main road,

00:39:43.760 --> 00:39:46.760
 there's a big sign that says, "Welcome to speed."

00:39:46.760 --> 00:39:50.760
 People took that as an invitation

00:39:50.760 --> 00:39:53.760
 and would start going really fast in the town.

00:39:53.760 --> 00:39:57.760
 And so in 2011, the residents of Speed started a campaign

00:39:57.760 --> 00:40:01.760
 to get the name of the town changed to Speed Kills.

00:40:01.760 --> 00:40:03.760
 And they got 32,000 likes on Facebook

00:40:03.760 --> 00:40:06.760
 to try and get their name changed.

00:40:06.760 --> 00:40:10.760
 And in the end, they renamed the town for one month to Speed Kills.

00:40:10.760 --> 00:40:16.760
 And as part of the campaign, there was a local farmer called Phil Down,

00:40:16.760 --> 00:40:19.760
 and he changed his name to Phil Slowdown.

00:40:24.760 --> 00:40:28.760
 No, that's the secondest place in Victoria.

00:40:28.760 --> 00:40:32.760
 Durham Ox had a sort of quite sad end in a way.

00:40:32.760 --> 00:40:33.760
 Well, it died, yeah.

00:40:33.760 --> 00:40:38.760
 Yeah, so it dislocated its hip while being let out of the carriage,

00:40:38.760 --> 00:40:42.760
 the famous carriage that we've spoken about, while in Oxford.

00:40:42.760 --> 00:40:44.760
 And it had to be slaughtered two months later.

00:40:44.760 --> 00:40:48.760
 But day, ever the showman turned that into an event itself.

00:40:48.760 --> 00:40:51.760
 And I believe, correct me if I'm wrong guys,

00:40:51.760 --> 00:40:54.760
 there was an autopsy which was sort of shown to the public

00:40:54.760 --> 00:40:57.760
 on the day that it had died.

00:40:57.760 --> 00:41:00.760
 And I think they might have shown,

00:41:00.760 --> 00:41:03.760
 you might have been able to buy a ticket to watch it die, basically.

00:41:03.760 --> 00:41:05.760
 To watch it die, yeah.

00:41:05.760 --> 00:41:07.760
 But then it was, yeah, and then it was chopped up.

00:41:07.760 --> 00:41:12.760
 And part of the merch stand that he set up was selling offcuts

00:41:12.760 --> 00:41:14.760
 of the Durham Ox, yeah.

00:41:14.760 --> 00:41:15.760
 I don't think that's cool.

00:41:15.760 --> 00:41:17.760
 When you go to a butcher, I don't think you say,

00:41:17.760 --> 00:41:19.760
 you know, can you go to a merch stand over there

00:41:19.760 --> 00:41:21.760
 and get a lot of land, please?

00:41:21.760 --> 00:41:24.760
 It's not branded.

00:41:24.760 --> 00:41:26.760
 Well, it could be branded if it's a catalog.

00:41:26.760 --> 00:41:27.760
 Somewhere will be, yeah.

00:41:27.760 --> 00:41:29.760
 Yeah, OK.

00:41:29.760 --> 00:41:31.760
 I found another famous ox,

00:41:31.760 --> 00:41:33.760
 actually a couple of famous oxes,

00:41:33.760 --> 00:41:34.760
 and this was over in America.

00:41:34.760 --> 00:41:39.760
 There was two oxen called Mount Cotardin and A Granger,

00:41:39.760 --> 00:41:41.760
 named after the two biggest things.

00:41:41.760 --> 00:41:42.760
 Sorry.

00:41:42.760 --> 00:41:44.760
 Does anyone else feel a Madison Square?

00:41:44.760 --> 00:41:48.760
 I'm really excited to know what kind of venue they might have made.

00:41:48.760 --> 00:41:53.760
 So they were named after the two largest items in Maine at the time.

00:41:53.760 --> 00:41:55.760
 That's where they got their names from.

00:41:55.760 --> 00:41:57.760
 And they were humongous.

00:41:57.760 --> 00:42:01.760
 They were supposedly, I can't find anything to contradict this,

00:42:01.760 --> 00:42:04.760
 the biggest and tallest oxen, respectively,

00:42:04.760 --> 00:42:06.760
 that the world has ever seen.

00:42:06.760 --> 00:42:09.760
 So Mount Cotardin weighed two and a half tons.

00:42:09.760 --> 00:42:10.760
 Wow.

00:42:10.760 --> 00:42:13.760
 So they were tall, they were wide,

00:42:13.760 --> 00:42:15.760
 and they were celebrities, and they went around,

00:42:15.760 --> 00:42:17.760
 and they did a lot of gigs,

00:42:17.760 --> 00:42:20.760
 and eventually they played Madison Square Garden.

00:42:20.760 --> 00:42:21.760
 No.

00:42:21.760 --> 00:42:22.760
 No.

00:42:22.760 --> 00:42:23.760
 Oh, my God.

00:42:23.760 --> 00:42:26.760
 Yeah, Madison Square Garden, which...

00:42:26.760 --> 00:42:30.760
 We said a couple of weeks ago when Sarah was here, Sarah Pasco,

00:42:30.760 --> 00:42:33.760
 that, or you said, I think,

00:42:33.760 --> 00:42:36.760
 that was it, Emmeline Pynkhurst played Madison Square Gardens.

00:42:36.760 --> 00:42:37.760
 That's right.

00:42:37.760 --> 00:42:42.760
 And she had a crowd of 3,000 in a 19,000-seater stadium.

00:42:42.760 --> 00:42:46.760
 Do you know how many people went to see the oxen?

00:42:46.760 --> 00:42:49.760
 Actually, I assumed that it was the current Madison Square Garden

00:42:49.760 --> 00:42:52.760
 with the ginormous 18,000 capacity.

00:42:52.760 --> 00:42:55.760
 But actually, it turns out that it's been rebuilt a few times,

00:42:55.760 --> 00:42:57.760
 and she actually played the second iteration

00:42:57.760 --> 00:42:59.760
 of the Madison Square Garden,

00:42:59.760 --> 00:43:01.760
 which had a capacity of 8,000 people.

00:43:01.760 --> 00:43:04.760
 So she still was kind of suffering in the sales department.

00:43:04.760 --> 00:43:07.760
 She only sold 3,000, that's less than 50%,

00:43:07.760 --> 00:43:11.760
 but it's not as great a discrepancy as 18,000.

00:43:11.760 --> 00:43:14.760
 So, yeah, so apologies to all the people on Twitter

00:43:14.760 --> 00:43:15.760
 who've pointed this out.

00:43:15.760 --> 00:43:16.760
 Very, very sorry.

00:43:16.760 --> 00:43:19.760
 But this is the very same Madison Square Garden,

00:43:19.760 --> 00:43:20.760
 Madison Square Garden 2,

00:43:20.760 --> 00:43:24.760
 where these two giant oxen played in 1906.

00:43:24.760 --> 00:43:26.760
 They must have somewhere...

00:43:26.760 --> 00:43:28.760
 You know how some venues in the UK

00:43:28.760 --> 00:43:31.760
 have a book for all the acts that play there to sign?

00:43:31.760 --> 00:43:32.760
 Yeah.

00:43:32.760 --> 00:43:36.760
 Presumably, somewhere in the basement of Madison Square Gardens,

00:43:36.760 --> 00:43:38.760
 there is a book which has got the signature

00:43:38.760 --> 00:43:42.760
 of Emily Pankhurst and a poof print of a giant ox.

00:43:42.760 --> 00:43:46.760
 How cool, yeah.

00:43:46.760 --> 00:43:47.760
 We can only assume.

00:43:47.760 --> 00:43:49.760
 We haven't actually said what Mox is.

00:43:49.760 --> 00:43:50.760
 Oh.

00:43:50.760 --> 00:43:52.760
 It's a castrated male cow.

00:43:52.760 --> 00:43:57.760
 But they used to be really popular for farming,

00:43:57.760 --> 00:43:59.760
 and they used to be way more popular

00:43:59.760 --> 00:44:02.760
 as draft animals pulling plows and things than horses.

00:44:02.760 --> 00:44:04.760
 But there were a few disadvantages,

00:44:04.760 --> 00:44:07.760
 and gradually they went out of fashion a bit slower

00:44:07.760 --> 00:44:08.760
 and a bit less versatile.

00:44:08.760 --> 00:44:11.760
 One of the problems is you can't change their shoes.

00:44:11.760 --> 00:44:13.760
 Like you can a horse.

00:44:13.760 --> 00:44:16.760
 So horses stand on all four legs.

00:44:16.760 --> 00:44:19.760
 And when you want to change a shoe,

00:44:19.760 --> 00:44:21.760
 the horse can stand on three legs.

00:44:21.760 --> 00:44:22.760
 It can cope with that.

00:44:22.760 --> 00:44:23.760
 And you can change a shoe,

00:44:23.760 --> 00:44:25.760
 and then you put that down and you change the other shoes.

00:44:25.760 --> 00:44:26.760
 Oxen can't do that.

00:44:26.760 --> 00:44:28.760
 They can't stand on three legs.

00:44:28.760 --> 00:44:30.760
 So to put shoes on an ox,

00:44:30.760 --> 00:44:32.760
 which is necessary if you're farming with them,

00:44:32.760 --> 00:44:35.760
 what you have to do is you have to push it over

00:44:35.760 --> 00:44:37.760
 onto the ground.

00:44:37.760 --> 00:44:40.760
 And then you have to have basically a massive fork

00:44:40.760 --> 00:44:43.760
 to gently hold it in place by the neck.

00:44:43.760 --> 00:44:46.760
 And then you tie its feet together so you don't get gourd.

00:44:46.760 --> 00:44:47.760
 A pitchfork.

00:44:47.760 --> 00:44:48.760
 What?

00:44:48.760 --> 00:44:50.760
 You can't put a fork in its neck?

00:44:50.760 --> 00:44:51.760
 Around its neck.

00:44:51.760 --> 00:44:54.760
 It's gone either side, so it's like that.

00:44:54.760 --> 00:44:56.760
 It's like in action films

00:44:56.760 --> 00:44:58.760
 when someone always has a pitchfork thrown at them

00:44:58.760 --> 00:45:00.760
 and it lands on either side of their neck, doesn't it?

00:45:00.760 --> 00:45:01.760
 It's exactly like that.

00:45:01.760 --> 00:45:02.760
 Oh, yeah.

00:45:02.760 --> 00:45:05.760
 You can never see that in an action film.

00:45:05.760 --> 00:45:06.760
 Is that in Die Hard?

00:45:06.760 --> 00:45:07.760
 I'm not sure.

00:45:07.760 --> 00:45:08.760
 I don't really remember it.

00:45:08.760 --> 00:45:10.760
 It's in one of the sequels.

00:45:10.760 --> 00:45:12.760
 So that's one method.

00:45:12.760 --> 00:45:14.760
 And that's pretty hardcore.

00:45:14.760 --> 00:45:15.760
 You have to be pretty brave to do that.

00:45:15.760 --> 00:45:18.760
 The alternate method is to use a thing called an ox sling,

00:45:18.760 --> 00:45:20.760
 which is this massive framework of beams,

00:45:20.760 --> 00:45:21.760
 and you get the oxen to walk in,

00:45:21.760 --> 00:45:24.760
 and then you just lift it up off the ground

00:45:24.760 --> 00:45:26.760
 and you have it hovering in the air,

00:45:26.760 --> 00:45:28.760
 and then you have to fit the shoes like that.

00:45:28.760 --> 00:45:30.760
 So you can see where they went out of fashion.

00:45:30.760 --> 00:45:31.760
 Yeah.

00:45:31.760 --> 00:45:33.760
 So the ox, though, the sling one,

00:45:33.760 --> 00:45:35.760
 I prefer that to the lying on your back

00:45:35.760 --> 00:45:38.760
 with the pitchfork around your neck and your legs tied together.

00:45:38.760 --> 00:45:40.760
 If you had the choice.

00:45:40.760 --> 00:45:43.760
 Next time you're in plaques and buy some new shoes.

00:45:43.760 --> 00:45:48.760
 This is like Die Hard.

00:45:48.760 --> 00:45:57.760
 OK, it's time for our final fact of the show,

00:45:57.760 --> 00:45:59.760
 and that is my fact.

00:45:59.760 --> 00:46:02.760
 And the fact is that the World's Least Frequently Published

00:46:02.760 --> 00:46:05.760
 Newspaper is released once every four years on Leap Day.

00:46:05.760 --> 00:46:07.760
 The print edition costs €4.70,

00:46:07.760 --> 00:46:11.760
 or you can subscribe to it for €100 per century.

00:46:11.760 --> 00:46:14.760
 That's a cool subscription.

00:46:14.760 --> 00:46:17.760
 So this is La Bougie du Saper,

00:46:17.760 --> 00:46:21.760
 which is a satirical newspaper that began in 1980.

00:46:21.760 --> 00:46:25.760
 Two friends decided that they wanted to do this as a thing,

00:46:25.760 --> 00:46:27.760
 and they made it a reality.

00:46:27.760 --> 00:46:30.760
 The title translates as The Sapper's Candle,

00:46:30.760 --> 00:46:33.760
 and it's a reference to a cartoon character

00:46:33.760 --> 00:46:35.760
 who was called The Sapper Camembert,

00:46:35.760 --> 00:46:37.760
 and he was born on the 29th of February.

00:46:37.760 --> 00:46:40.760
 He joined the Army just as he celebrated his fourth birthday.

00:46:40.760 --> 00:46:42.760
 That's the reference to the title.

00:46:42.760 --> 00:46:44.760
 But yeah, it's a wonderful newspaper

00:46:44.760 --> 00:46:46.760
 that is still going to this day,

00:46:46.760 --> 00:46:49.760
 and it has a huge readership that just keeps growing and growing,

00:46:49.760 --> 00:46:51.760
 and lots of lovely little in-jokes.

00:46:51.760 --> 00:46:53.760
 They have a last-minute section

00:46:53.760 --> 00:46:55.760
 that they managed to squeeze in, you know,

00:46:55.760 --> 00:46:57.760
 and add news into it.

00:46:57.760 --> 00:46:59.760
 Sometimes, obviously, if you've done the crossword,

00:46:59.760 --> 00:47:03.760
 you've got to wait four years for the answers to appear.

00:47:03.760 --> 00:47:05.760
 And sometimes they make the decision

00:47:05.760 --> 00:47:07.760
 not to publish it until eight years later,

00:47:07.760 --> 00:47:09.760
 the answers, and just keep people hanging.

00:47:09.760 --> 00:47:12.760
 So yeah, they're really fun, these guys.

00:47:12.760 --> 00:47:15.760
 I was surprised that you could get that subscription

00:47:15.760 --> 00:47:18.760
 because there was an interview with the editor in 2012

00:47:18.760 --> 00:47:20.760
 who said he had considered offering subscriptions,

00:47:20.760 --> 00:47:22.760
 but it would be too difficult to find people

00:47:22.760 --> 00:47:24.760
 as the likelihood as they would have moved house

00:47:24.760 --> 00:47:26.760
 between publication dates.

00:47:26.760 --> 00:47:28.760
 So he's obviously got a better way of tracking his...

00:47:28.760 --> 00:47:32.760
 Well, it's a good way of getting 100 euros out of people, isn't it?

00:47:32.760 --> 00:47:35.760
 They had a Sunday supplement in 2004,

00:47:35.760 --> 00:47:38.760
 and the next one is going to be in 2032.

00:47:38.760 --> 00:47:41.760
 So they kind of like do a kind of each day of the week thing,

00:47:41.760 --> 00:47:43.760
 which is quite cool, I think.

00:47:43.760 --> 00:47:45.760
 That's really good. And they're not working on this full-time, are they?

00:47:45.760 --> 00:47:47.760
 They can't be.

00:47:47.760 --> 00:47:49.760
 No, they don't. Once, say, every four years,

00:47:49.760 --> 00:47:52.760
 they kind of meet up in a restaurant, I think, in Paris

00:47:52.760 --> 00:47:54.760
 and drink champagne and kind of come up

00:47:54.760 --> 00:47:56.760
 with what funny ideas they're going to put into it.

00:47:56.760 --> 00:47:58.760
 Brilliant. That's so good.

00:47:58.760 --> 00:48:00.760
 But the editor, the current editor, has been working on it

00:48:00.760 --> 00:48:03.760
 for, you know, over a decade at least,

00:48:03.760 --> 00:48:06.760
 and certainly has been the editor for about three issues or so.

00:48:06.760 --> 00:48:09.760
 So it's got, you know, stable staff, which is good.

00:48:09.760 --> 00:48:13.760
 And it does have a print run, I think, this year of 200,000,

00:48:13.760 --> 00:48:16.760
 which is not to say that's the number that we'll sell,

00:48:16.760 --> 00:48:20.760
 but that's a print run, so it's got big tickets on itself.

00:48:20.760 --> 00:48:23.760
 Yeah, there's some interesting stories in this week,

00:48:23.760 --> 00:48:26.760
 in this, not this week's, this, what do you say,

00:48:26.760 --> 00:48:29.760
 quadrennial edition.

00:48:29.760 --> 00:48:31.760
 They talk about Brexit, of course.

00:48:31.760 --> 00:48:35.760
 There is an interview with Cedric Villani,

00:48:35.760 --> 00:48:38.760
 the mathematician-commerical candidate.

00:48:38.760 --> 00:48:42.760
 There is a story about Maurice, the cockerel.

00:48:42.760 --> 00:48:44.760
 Do you remember this?

00:48:44.760 --> 00:48:46.760
 They're basically talking about all the things that have happened

00:48:46.760 --> 00:48:48.760
 over the last four years.

00:48:48.760 --> 00:48:50.760
 And one of them was Maurice the cockerel,

00:48:50.760 --> 00:48:54.760
 who became really famous because people were complaining

00:48:54.760 --> 00:48:56.760
 that he was cockrelling too loud.

00:48:56.760 --> 00:48:59.760
 And the people who lived in the countryside said,

00:48:59.760 --> 00:49:01.760
 well, this is what the countryside sounds like.

00:49:01.760 --> 00:49:04.760
 So if you don't like it, go back to Paris, kind of thing.

00:49:04.760 --> 00:49:08.760
 And they came up with a law basically protecting

00:49:08.760 --> 00:49:10.760
 the sound of the French countryside.

00:49:10.760 --> 00:49:12.760
 I'm sure you guys remember that story.

00:49:12.760 --> 00:49:16.760
 I found out that since the magazine came out, Maurice died.

00:49:16.760 --> 00:49:18.760
 He died in June.

00:49:18.760 --> 00:49:20.760
 Is there any merch that we can get hold of of Maurice

00:49:20.760 --> 00:49:23.760
 since maybe a breast or a leg?

00:49:23.760 --> 00:49:29.760
 He actually, he died in May, but it was announced in June

00:49:29.760 --> 00:49:32.760
 because the owner said that what with lockdown,

00:49:32.760 --> 00:49:34.760
 people already had enough to worry about

00:49:34.760 --> 00:49:38.760
 without having to think about Maurice the cockerel's death.

00:49:38.760 --> 00:49:41.760
 That just would have been the cherry on the icing, wouldn't it?

00:49:41.760 --> 00:49:43.760
 Damn you, 2020!

00:49:43.760 --> 00:49:49.760
 So I was looking into some other interesting

00:49:49.760 --> 00:49:51.760
 or innovative newspapers.

00:49:51.760 --> 00:49:53.760
 And I don't think we've ever said this.

00:49:53.760 --> 00:49:56.760
 Quite a few newspapers used to have space

00:49:56.760 --> 00:49:58.760
 that you could add your own news in.

00:49:58.760 --> 00:50:00.760
 This is so cool.

00:50:00.760 --> 00:50:04.760
 So the first ever evening paper was launched in 1696

00:50:04.760 --> 00:50:07.760
 by a guy called Ichabod Dorks.

00:50:09.760 --> 00:50:11.760
 Such a good name.

00:50:11.760 --> 00:50:15.760
 DAWK, not D-O-R-K, great either way.

00:50:15.760 --> 00:50:16.760
 What a name.

00:50:16.760 --> 00:50:19.760
 It's called Dorks Newsletter, that's the name of it.

00:50:19.760 --> 00:50:23.760
 And basically, there was just space.

00:50:23.760 --> 00:50:27.760
 So the buyer, who might be the grocer or might be the individual,

00:50:27.760 --> 00:50:29.760
 but you could write your own news in,

00:50:29.760 --> 00:50:32.760
 or you could say hello to an individual subscriber.

00:50:32.760 --> 00:50:36.760
 But it's amazing that only Dorks are going to be bothered to do that, right?

00:50:36.760 --> 00:50:39.760
 Wait, but what do you mean you could write a message to a subscriber?

00:50:39.760 --> 00:50:42.760
 So who was allowed to write the news in the blank bit?

00:50:42.760 --> 00:50:46.760
 Anyone is, but let's say it's the local news agent.

00:50:46.760 --> 00:50:48.760
 You could say hello, Mr Jenkins,

00:50:48.760 --> 00:50:51.760
 thought you might like to know that Murray's The Cockerel is Dead,

00:50:51.760 --> 00:50:54.760
 waited to tell you until now because you would have been sad.

00:50:54.760 --> 00:50:55.760
 And then you could add that in.

00:50:55.760 --> 00:50:57.760
 Or even as the end user of the newspaper,

00:50:57.760 --> 00:51:00.760
 you can also write in it and then hand it over to your wife saying,

00:51:00.760 --> 00:51:03.760
 "I've made you some nice pie," if you write in that bit.

00:51:03.760 --> 00:51:05.760
 That's very cool, very nice.

00:51:05.760 --> 00:51:09.760
 I was reading about, it's now online, it's called The Antarctic Sun,

00:51:09.760 --> 00:51:14.760
 but that used to be a paper that was published for people who live,

00:51:14.760 --> 00:51:16.760
 the scientists who live in Antarctica,

00:51:16.760 --> 00:51:18.760
 and it'd be sent round to them all,

00:51:18.760 --> 00:51:21.760
 and it would cover sort of relevant news to them

00:51:21.760 --> 00:51:24.760
 as opposed to news from the rest of the world.

00:51:24.760 --> 00:51:26.760
 Was there a weather report?

00:51:26.760 --> 00:51:31.760
 Getting very slightly warmer.

00:51:31.760 --> 00:51:34.760
 But before them, before they existed,

00:51:34.760 --> 00:51:37.760
 there was another paper which was called The McMurdo News,

00:51:37.760 --> 00:51:39.760
 the sort of predecessor to them,

00:51:39.760 --> 00:51:43.760
 and that was then followed by The McMurdo Sometimes,

00:51:43.760 --> 00:51:46.760
 because the publishing schedule was so erratic

00:51:46.760 --> 00:51:49.760
 that they couldn't promise that it would always be consistent.

00:51:49.760 --> 00:51:53.760
 And that lasted from 1960 to 1980 as a paper.

00:51:53.760 --> 00:51:54.760
 I love that.

00:51:54.760 --> 00:51:56.760
 Although did you know that McMurdo Sometimes

00:51:56.760 --> 00:51:59.760
 changed its name halfway through to The McMurdo Sometimes?

00:51:59.760 --> 00:52:00.760
 Explain that.

00:52:00.760 --> 00:52:02.760
 It was The McMurdo Sometimes in 1960,

00:52:02.760 --> 00:52:05.760
 but it was spelled S-O-M-E-T-I-M-E-Z.

00:52:05.760 --> 00:52:07.760
 And then for some reason, in 1972,

00:52:07.760 --> 00:52:10.760
 they decided to change the name to spell the word Sometimes correctly.

00:52:10.760 --> 00:52:12.760
 That's right, professionalizing.

00:52:12.760 --> 00:52:14.760
 Maybe they got a publisher without a sense of humour.

00:52:14.760 --> 00:52:15.760
 Bizarre.

00:52:15.760 --> 00:52:19.760
 The latest article in the, what is now The Antarctic Sun,

00:52:19.760 --> 00:52:20.760
 did you see what it was about?

00:52:20.760 --> 00:52:21.760
 No.

00:52:21.760 --> 00:52:23.760
 Well, I think Andy might want to subscribe,

00:52:23.760 --> 00:52:24.760
 maybe move to Antarctica,

00:52:24.760 --> 00:52:27.760
 because it was called Masses of Mosses.

00:52:27.760 --> 00:52:31.760
 It was about the moss that's taking over Antarctica.

00:52:31.760 --> 00:52:33.760
 Get me on a plane.

00:52:33.760 --> 00:52:34.760
 Brilliant.

00:52:34.760 --> 00:52:37.760
 I imagine it's probably also covered in the docks times,

00:52:37.760 --> 00:52:39.760
 or whatever it was.

00:52:39.760 --> 00:52:41.760
 Anna, as soon as you said that, I thought,

00:52:41.760 --> 00:52:43.760
 which thing am I going to be slammed for now?

00:52:43.760 --> 00:52:45.760
 Is it going to be moss or is it going to be funicular railways?

00:52:45.760 --> 00:52:47.760
 Is it going to be one of the other things I developed

00:52:47.760 --> 00:52:50.760
 and unlikely crush on in the last six years?

00:52:50.760 --> 00:52:52.760
 And did you manage, by the time I did the big reveal,

00:52:52.760 --> 00:52:54.760
 did you manage to have worked out which was more likely

00:52:54.760 --> 00:52:55.760
 to exist in Antarctica?

00:52:55.760 --> 00:52:57.760
 I thought they can't be really funicular.

00:52:57.760 --> 00:53:01.760
 OK, that's it.

00:53:01.760 --> 00:53:02.760
 That is all of our facts.

00:53:02.760 --> 00:53:03.760
