00:00:10,280 --> 00:00:15,760
 Hello and welcome to another episode of No Such Thing as a Fish,

3
00:00:15,760 --> 00:00:19,800
 a weekly podcast this week coming to you live from Brisbane.

4
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:24,720
 >> [APPLAUSE]

5
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:26,760
 >> My name is Dan Shriver.

6
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:31,880
 I'm sitting here with Anna Tushinsky, Andrew Hunter Murray, and James Harkin.

7
00:00:31,880 --> 00:00:35,200
 And once again, we have gathered around the microphones with our four favorite

8
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:40,800
 facts from the last seven days and in no particular order, here we go.

9
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:43,840
 Starting with fact number one, and that is my fact.

10
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:50,320
 My fact this week is that Christmas is a very dangerous time for German penises.

11
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:52,200
 >> [LAUGH]

12
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:56,240
 >> This is a little study that was released last year where

13
00:00:56,240 --> 00:01:00,440
 German scientists were looking into the rate of hospital visits

14
00:01:00,440 --> 00:01:04,640
 whereby someone has walked in and said, I think I've snapped my penis.

15
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:05,800
 >> Snapped?

16
00:01:05,800 --> 00:01:07,680
 >> You hear a crack when it happens.

17
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:08,880
 >> No, too much.

18
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:10,400
 >> Well, that's what we're talking about unfortunately.

19
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:11,760
 >> Merry Christmas.

20
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:14,320
 >> Is this going to be our Christmas special?

21
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:17,280
 >> Yeah, I think, yeah, a Christmas special and

22
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:20,000
 a sort of health and safety message.

23
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:20,880
 >> Public service.

24
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:22,400
 >> Yeah, so.

25
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:26,040
 >> So actually, okay, to say that, that would happen if people are having sex, right?

26
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:28,080
 So are we saying that more people are having sex and

27
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:29,320
 that's why they're injuring themselves?

28
00:01:29,320 --> 00:01:30,560
 >> Exactly, they're in party mode.

29
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:31,280
 >> I see.

30
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:34,320
 >> And so a lot more sex happens in that period.

31
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:38,960
 It says the injury tends to occur during wild sex,

32
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:43,480
 particularly in positions where you're not in direct eye contact.

33
00:01:43,480 --> 00:01:47,200
 >> [LAUGH]

34
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:48,840
 >> I'll always maintain eye contact, though.

35
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:50,080
 >> [LAUGH]

36
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:53,080
 >> There's no such, I don't think there is such a position, is there?

37
00:01:53,080 --> 00:01:54,320
 We're not in direct eye contact.

38
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:55,800
 >> [LAUGH]

39
00:01:55,800 --> 00:01:57,400
 >> Not in my order.

40
00:01:57,400 --> 00:02:01,100
 >> [LAUGH]

41
00:02:01,100 --> 00:02:03,240
 >> And by the way, Australia, you think you're getting off lightly.

42
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:06,240
 It's also a dangerous time for Australian penises, so be careful.

43
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:10,760
 There was a Queensland doctor who said the cases had spiked by sort of 20,

44
00:02:10,760 --> 00:02:12,440
 I think, no, 50%, I think it was.

45
00:02:12,440 --> 00:02:13,520
 >> Wow, in that period?

46
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:14,240
 >> Yeah, yeah, yeah.

47
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:15,120
 >> Wow.

48
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:18,800
 >> It settles down about New Year's time in Germany for German penises.

49
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:22,200
 There's less sex at the New Year period.

50
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:25,120
 So it sort of calms down by the end of the year.

51
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:30,400
 But yeah, it's apparently when people go in with this injury,

52
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:37,120
 it's quite a sight, the term color of an aubergine is often used.

53
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:39,040
 >> My God.

54
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:39,560
 >> Yeah.

55
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:41,600
 >> I am never using that emoji ever again.

56
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:43,680
 >> [LAUGH]

57
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:48,280
 >> And it apparently remained consistent during the COVID-19 pandemic.

58
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:51,400
 >> Right. >> Yeah, so that didn't dent it at all in that period.

59
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:53,640
 >> No, it snapped it, I really forgot.

60
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:55,480
 >> [LAUGH]

61
00:02:55,480 --> 00:02:55,960
 >> Yeah.

62
00:02:55,960 --> 00:03:00,280
 >> That's why, because that's not the most dangerous phenomenon for penises.

63
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:00,640
 >> What do you mean?

64
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:01,560
 >> Which I thought it might be.

65
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:05,480
 Well, the thing that causes most penis injuries, most penis hospital visits,

66
00:03:05,480 --> 00:03:06,800
 probably guessable.

67
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:08,280
 >> Vacuum cleaners.

68
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:08,840
 >> Okay.

69
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:10,400
 >> [LAUGH]

70
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:11,160
 >> Yeah, yeah.

71
00:03:11,160 --> 00:03:14,160
 >> I knew I was gonna overshare as soon as I opened my mouth then.

72
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:16,160
 >> Yeah, you should have waited a split second for

73
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:19,160
 that chap in the audience to interrupt you with the correct answer.

74
00:03:19,160 --> 00:03:22,920
 Because I think you just said flies, and it is flies.

75
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:27,200
 >> I thought you said wives, and I thought, [LAUGH]

76
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:29,040
 >> Girlfriends can do it too.

77
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:30,200
 >> Flies, of course.

78
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:33,000
 >> Zippers, yeah, people getting zipped up in them.

79
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:37,360
 Accounts for not 0.5% of ER visits altogether, which I think is quite high.

80
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:38,440
 >> That is quite a lot.

81
00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:42,680
 >> One in 200, mostly children or younger teenagers.

82
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:45,840
 When you're not quite, you haven't learned yet that it's there.

83
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:46,720
 >> [LAUGH]

84
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:47,880
 >> It takes a few years.

85
00:03:47,880 --> 00:03:49,460
 >> Yes, yeah, yeah.

86
00:03:49,460 --> 00:03:52,720
 >> In 13th century England, Christmas was a very dangerous time for

87
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:58,840
 testicles if you were a person who made money, if you were working in the mint.

88
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:03,960
 Because the penalty for debasing coinage was cutting off the money as right hand

89
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:08,320
 and right testicle, and nailing it to the door of the smithy.

90
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:10,720
 And then- >> Wait a second.

91
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:12,080
 These coins are all made of chocolate.

92
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:14,240
 >> [LAUGH]

93
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:18,560
 >> Yeah, because in 1125, on Christmas Day, Henry I got all of the

94
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:22,600
 moneys to Winchester and had one of their balls chopped off.

95
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:23,680
 >> On Christmas Day?

96
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:25,760
 >> Christmas Day, wow.

97
00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:28,280
 >> Well, so he had one of each of their balls chopped off?

98
00:04:28,280 --> 00:04:30,080
 Or just he picked one out of a hat.

99
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:34,120
 >> No, no, it wasn't out of a hat, he got all the moneys in.

100
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:38,120
 I think about there were like four or five of them who got off, not in that way.

101
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:40,640
 >> [LAUGH]

102
00:04:40,640 --> 00:04:43,040
 >> Can I ask you guys a quick question?

103
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:46,120
 >> Yes, has anyone on this panel, and I'll put this out to the room as well,

104
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:48,880
 does anyone know anyone who's ever had a broken penis?

105
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:49,320
 >> No.

106
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:50,080
 >> No.

107
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:51,440
 >> It's okay, a few people have.

108
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:53,840
 >> What do you mean, like hospital level broken?

109
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:55,920
 >> Yeah. >> Or googling it in a panic level broken.

110
00:04:55,920 --> 00:05:03,400
 >> [LAUGH]

111
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:04,280
 >> But I know both.

112
00:05:04,280 --> 00:05:07,280
 >> [LAUGH]

113
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:11,800
 >> I know two people, so one was a kid on our school bus in Sydney.

114
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:15,560
 He was, I wasn't there on this day annoyingly, but they gave him a wedgie that

115
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:20,180
 was so hard that, and so they lifted him to like the top bar.

116
00:05:20,180 --> 00:05:23,360
 And then he went, a different sound came out of this,

117
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:25,640
 like a guttural animal sound came out.

118
00:05:25,640 --> 00:05:28,120
 And he was missing for weeks, cuz his penis had snapped.

119
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:29,520
 So that was one person.

120
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:32,920
 And then the second person, the three of you do know.

121
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:33,600
 >> Great.

122
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:35,880
 >> [LAUGH]

123
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:37,340
 >> It's me, no, it's not me.

124
00:05:37,340 --> 00:05:39,600
 >> [LAUGH]

125
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:41,840
 >> It's a guest who's been on our show.

126
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:44,320
 Someone who broke their member on- >> Sandy Toxic.

127
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:47,080
 >> [LAUGH]

128
00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:49,400
 >> Is it someone where this is public information or

129
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:53,160
 are you the only person they told in secrecy and now it's going out to the world?

130
00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:55,080
 >> I think Stephen Fry said I could say this.

131
00:05:55,080 --> 00:05:56,640
 >> [LAUGH]

132
00:05:56,640 --> 00:05:59,060
 >> It was Johnny Knoxville of Jack Ass.

133
00:05:59,060 --> 00:06:00,040
 >> That makes a lot of sense.

134
00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:03,560
 >> Yeah, he puts himself at risk quite a lot, doesn't he?

135
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:06,840
 >> He went over on a motorbike and he landed and he broke it.

136
00:06:06,840 --> 00:06:08,080
 And he's always asked about it.

137
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:09,920
 He says this has been well documented.

138
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:12,240
 So much has been said about so little.

139
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:14,360
 >> [LAUGH]

140
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:16,000
 >> And they said that he might not,

141
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,760
 it was gonna suffer from it, but he's had two kids since it happened.

142
00:06:18,760 --> 00:06:20,920
 So, yeah, it's all fine.

143
00:06:20,920 --> 00:06:21,920
 >> Can I talk about Christmas?

144
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:22,520
 >> Yes, please.

145
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:25,440
 >> Yeah, let's get away from, please, please, please.

146
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:30,440
 Okay, do you want to hear an absolutely wild thing that happened in Christmas 1972?

147
00:06:30,440 --> 00:06:33,560
 Okay, it was sent in by a listener called Yara T, so thank you for this.

148
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:37,240
 Marie Heffernan was a 13-year-old girl.

149
00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:39,280
 She had a Christmas dinner with her family, right?

150
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:42,680
 In Australia, at their home near Wollongong, and she-

151
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:43,520
 >> Wollongong?

152
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:44,280
 >> Is that how it's pronounced?

153
00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:45,400
 >> [LAUGH]

154
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:46,960
 >> Is it like that?

155
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:49,640
 >> From the reaction, I'm not sure that's how you do pronounce it.

156
00:06:49,640 --> 00:06:51,200
 >> Wollongong.

157
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:52,320
 >> You cannot, I am Australian, you cannot play.

158
00:06:52,320 --> 00:06:53,600
 >> What are you saying?

159
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:55,240
 Wollongong, Wollongong.

160
00:06:55,240 --> 00:06:56,120
 >> Why are you not looking at me?

161
00:06:56,120 --> 00:06:57,240
 >> That's what I said.

162
00:06:57,240 --> 00:07:00,000
 I'm worried, you're gonna tell me about more penis stuff.

163
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,780
 >> He just wants some eye contact.

164
00:07:02,780 --> 00:07:03,280
 >> All right.

165
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:08,240
 >> [LAUGH]

166
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:11,400
 >> At their home near Wollongong.

167
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:12,680
 So she had this Christmas dinner.

168
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:16,760
 She got bad bronchitis and laryngitis after eating Christmas dinner, right?

169
00:07:16,760 --> 00:07:20,720
 It cleaned up, that sort of she got better, but her voice did not come back.

170
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:23,080
 And the doctors just said, well, you've lost your voice due to a virus.

171
00:07:23,080 --> 00:07:27,400
 It could come back any time, but it's, you know, you have to just wait.

172
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:32,200
 She waited for 12 years with no voice.

173
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:37,040
 And then, suddenly, at the age of 25, she started to choke.

174
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:38,920
 And this, she had a little coughing fit, and

175
00:07:38,920 --> 00:07:42,160
 it brought up this little sort of lump from her throat.

176
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:45,360
 She took the lump to the Royal Canberra Hospital, where a doctor found it was not

177
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:52,120
 human tissue, but a 1959 three penny coin that she had swallowed from the Christmas

178
00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:53,800
 pudding, or rather she hadn't swallowed it.

179
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:58,800
 It got stuck between her vocal cords, so it was thin and in a horizontal position.

180
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:01,160
 So the x-ray didn't see it when she was x-rayed.

181
00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:06,280
 So she had no voice for 12 years, because it had just stayed exactly in position

182
00:08:06,280 --> 00:08:07,880
 and stopped her vocal cords vibrating.

183
00:08:07,880 --> 00:08:11,480
 And then when they got it out, she went, I think there's a coin in my throat!

184
00:08:11,480 --> 00:08:17,560
 [LAUGHTER]

185
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:18,560
 Isn't that...

186
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:19,560
 That is mental.

187
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:24,680
 That's a little weird version of the Little Mermaid, isn't it?

188
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:29,800
 Yes, it's less contunes in that one, but yeah.

189
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:30,800
 Yeah, anyway.

190
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:34,680
 So the penis injuries aren't the most common injuries at Christmas, but there are quite

191
00:08:34,680 --> 00:08:38,040
 a lot of very Christmas-specific injuries, and I find it really interesting, because

192
00:08:38,040 --> 00:08:40,800
 they're all catalogued, and these stories come out at Christmas about what's the most

193
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:44,840
 likely way you'll get injured, and the way they collect the data is from hospital visits.

194
00:08:44,840 --> 00:08:47,800
 And they're all things where you think, why have you gone to hospital?

195
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:51,800
 So loads of people pull muscles getting turkey out of the oven.

196
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:58,280
 Now, what kind of diligent Christmas housewife is getting a turkey out of the oven, spraining

197
00:08:58,280 --> 00:09:01,960
 a little bit of an arm, and demanding she goes to hospital, rather than serving up bloody

198
00:09:01,960 --> 00:09:03,800
 lunch like she should be?

199
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:09,600
 Honestly, I just like to disassociate myself with that comment.

200
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:13,480
 Welcome to Back to the 1950s.

201
00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:14,480
 Christmas in the 50s.

202
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:20,440
 No, there's some other weird ones, like a woman who slipped while stapling a Christmas light,

203
00:09:20,440 --> 00:09:21,440
 stapled her left hand.

204
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:23,400
 I've put a stapler in my hand.

205
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:24,400
 They're very small.

206
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:25,400
 Don't go to hospital.

207
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:27,720
 Isn't this fair advice?

208
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:31,160
 You are such a loss to the NHS, and I love you.

209
00:09:31,160 --> 00:09:32,160
 Get out.

210
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:33,160
 Get out.

211
00:09:33,160 --> 00:09:34,160
 Get out.

212
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:35,160
 Get out.

213
00:09:35,160 --> 00:09:36,160
 No.

214
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:37,160
 No.

215
00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:38,160
 Just Google it.

216
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:39,160
 No.

217
00:09:39,160 --> 00:09:40,160
 Google in a panic.

218
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:42,160
 There was one where I thought, that's justified.

219
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:46,080
 This was on Christmas Day, a moment where a mum noticed her five-year-old was picking

220
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:50,720
 their nose, and when they got up closer to the five-year-old, they found that a foul odour

221
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:54,960
 was coming out of their nose, and it was discovered the child had put a Christmas decoration in

222
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:55,960
 their left nostril.

223
00:09:55,960 --> 00:10:00,760
 But what Christmas decoration emits a foul odour?

224
00:10:00,760 --> 00:10:03,520
 Maybe it had been there a while, or...

225
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:04,960
 So, only Christmas Day?

226
00:10:04,960 --> 00:10:05,960
 No, you're right.

227
00:10:05,960 --> 00:10:06,960
 You're right.

228
00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:09,520
 Well, there are always dogs that swallow tinsel, and then you have to pick a deer.

229
00:10:09,520 --> 00:10:11,040
 Don't go to any for them, either.

230
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:12,040
 No.

231
00:10:12,040 --> 00:10:14,160
 But you have to remove it from the other end, often, don't you?

232
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:15,160
 You do.

233
00:10:15,160 --> 00:10:17,560
 It's called a linear foreign body, if you're a vet.

234
00:10:17,560 --> 00:10:18,560
 Do you?

235
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:19,560
 Yeah.

236
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:22,160
 Is there any point where it's still coming through the mouth, and you're removing it

237
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:23,160
 from the other side?

238
00:10:23,160 --> 00:10:27,360
 I don't believe that sort of permanent dog floss has been invented, though.

239
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:28,360
 Interesting.

240
00:10:28,360 --> 00:10:29,360
 Yeah.

241
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:30,360
 Sorry.

242
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:35,360
 Yeah, America has a similar database where they log down all the Christmas injuries.

243
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:36,360
 Do you know what it is?

244
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:37,920
 Are you talking about NICE?

245
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:38,920
 Yeah.

246
00:10:38,920 --> 00:10:39,920
 So, NICE, NEISS.

247
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:44,360
 Sorry to jump across again, but National Electronic Injury Surveillance System, it records all

248
00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:45,360
 the data.

249
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:48,960
 And NICE is an anagram of NISA, which is the Danish for ELF.

250
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:49,960
 Oh, my God.

251
00:10:49,960 --> 00:10:50,960
 Yeah.

252
00:10:50,960 --> 00:10:51,960
 Wow.

253
00:10:51,960 --> 00:10:52,960
 What's going on there?

254
00:10:52,960 --> 00:10:53,960
 What's going on, Andy?

255
00:10:53,960 --> 00:10:54,960
 Yeah.

256
00:10:54,960 --> 00:10:55,960
 And NICE is also naughty or NICE.

257
00:10:55,960 --> 00:10:56,960
 Yeah.

258
00:10:56,960 --> 00:10:57,960
 What's going on?

259
00:10:57,960 --> 00:10:58,960
 What are they hiding?

260
00:10:58,960 --> 00:11:02,960
 Well, I think we'll all agree that was worth the interruption.

261
00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:08,960
 But so, yeah, they published a report in 2009.

262
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:11,960
 Do you want to go to the hospital for that first?

263
00:11:11,960 --> 00:11:14,960
 I feel like I do.

264
00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:20,960
 2014, 809 people were admitted into ER in the States for Christmas-based injuries.

265
00:11:20,960 --> 00:11:24,360
 There's a lot of normal ones, almost similar to the ones that you were talking about, Anna,

266
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:26,460
 about pieces getting stuck and so on.

267
00:11:26,460 --> 00:11:27,620
 This one's interesting.

268
00:11:27,620 --> 00:11:33,020
 This was a 21-year-old man who, according to the database, was riding on a TV when he

269
00:11:33,020 --> 00:11:39,320
 ran into a turkey and lost control and then ran into a tree.

270
00:11:39,320 --> 00:11:41,160
 No more information supplied.

271
00:11:41,160 --> 00:11:46,560
 Another big Christmas setback or mess up that you can have is food poisoning.

272
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:47,560
 Oh, yeah.

273
00:11:47,560 --> 00:11:50,120
 Because if you don't cook a turkey enough or anything, I guess.

274
00:11:50,120 --> 00:11:55,000
 So in 2013, there was a group of Norwegian seafood researchers from Norway's National

275
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:58,260
 Institute of Nutrition and Seafood Research, and they thought, "Let's have a Christmas

276
00:11:58,260 --> 00:11:59,760
 party.

277
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:04,320
 Why don't we use some lovely local cockles, and we'll serve them raw, but we'll pour boiling

278
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:05,600
 soup all over them."

279
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:07,680
 So that will theoretically be absolutely fine.

280
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:08,680
 Okay.

281
00:12:08,680 --> 00:12:10,680
 All of them got horrific food poisoning.

282
00:12:10,680 --> 00:12:13,920
 And then, because they were the investigators, they had to investigate their own Christmas

283
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:16,420
 party to see what had caused it.

284
00:12:16,420 --> 00:12:19,340
 The problem was that the soup was gaspacho, wasn't it?

285
00:12:19,340 --> 00:12:26,000
 Yeah, that's right.

286
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:30,640
 It is time for fact number two, and that is Anna.

287
00:12:30,640 --> 00:12:36,520
 My fact this week is that the value of goods Americans refund each year is more than the

288
00:12:36,520 --> 00:12:40,200
 GDP of 90% of the world's countries.

289
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:41,200
 What?

290
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:42,200
 What?

291
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:43,200
 What?

292
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:44,720
 It is a big problem.

293
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:49,380
 By some estimates, it takes you to an amount that is more than all but the richest 19 countries

294
00:12:49,380 --> 00:12:50,820
 in the world's GDP.

295
00:12:50,820 --> 00:12:56,420
 So Switzerland is about where you get to at which point Switzerland is financially a smaller

296
00:12:56,420 --> 00:13:00,140
 country than the returned goods of the United States of America.

297
00:13:00,140 --> 00:13:03,900
 It's also more than America spends on roads, railways, and airports put together.

298
00:13:03,900 --> 00:13:08,300
 I don't know what's like here in Oz at the moment, but back in the UK, I feel like there

299
00:13:08,300 --> 00:13:13,340
 needs to be a lane specifically now for people returning items, because that's what you're

300
00:13:13,340 --> 00:13:16,320
 stuck behind when you're trying to buy something in a physical shop.

301
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:20,520
 What it is is people are buying clothes, going out and partying one night, and then returning

302
00:13:20,520 --> 00:13:21,520
 it the next day.

303
00:13:21,520 --> 00:13:26,520
 They found that all these people who are returning stuff, there's just obvious patterns.

304
00:13:26,520 --> 00:13:30,360
 People who buy portable generators during weather emergencies, they'll use them right

305
00:13:30,360 --> 00:13:34,840
 until the emergency is ended, and then all of those go back, just as huge amount goes

306
00:13:34,840 --> 00:13:35,840
 back.

307
00:13:35,840 --> 00:13:41,120
 There's a big culture of lots and lots of refunds as well.

308
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:45,860
 You're entitled to a refund for lots of stuff, so in the USA, Petco will take back fish that

309
00:13:45,860 --> 00:13:47,180
 have died.

310
00:13:47,180 --> 00:13:49,240
 You can get a refund if your fish has died.

311
00:13:49,240 --> 00:13:51,040
 Like the Monty Python sketch.

312
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:53,720
 Pretty much, except they just don't quibble.

313
00:13:53,720 --> 00:14:00,140
 And Home Depot lets you return dead plants for a year.

314
00:14:00,140 --> 00:14:03,820
 All you have to do is be shameless enough to wrap up your dead plant and send it back,

315
00:14:03,820 --> 00:14:05,480
 and they will probably give you the refund.

316
00:14:05,480 --> 00:14:09,780
 The key thing to know there is they're not selling these things on, and this is why it's

317
00:14:09,780 --> 00:14:10,780
 a problem.

318
00:14:10,780 --> 00:14:14,480
 They don't flog a dead plant to some chump and convince them it's a rare species.

319
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:17,820
 Because I think that's what happens when people send back their cloves or something.

320
00:14:17,820 --> 00:14:21,720
 They think, "Oh, they'll just put it back on the rack and whatever."

321
00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:26,200
 They never do that, and most people will order three sizes of the same thing and then keep

322
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:28,200
 the one that fits and send the two others back.

323
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:29,200
 Most people.

324
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:31,360
 I mean, most people don't do that.

325
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:32,360
 Don't worry.

326
00:14:32,360 --> 00:14:33,360
 Sorry.

327
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:35,480
 Most people who have done the refunds.

328
00:14:35,480 --> 00:14:36,480
 My wife.

329
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:37,480
 My wife.

330
00:14:37,480 --> 00:14:38,480
 That's what I'm trying to say.

331
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:43,420
 So they'll send back the two that didn't fit, and then probably everyone assume, "Okay.

332
00:14:43,420 --> 00:14:45,420
 That just goes back on to ..." And it doesn't.

333
00:14:45,420 --> 00:14:47,260
 But when you think about it, it's an insane assumption to make.

334
00:14:47,260 --> 00:14:50,660
 Because I assume that if I send back this pair of socks, then it'll be returned and

335
00:14:50,660 --> 00:14:54,200
 it'll be somehow got back into the stream of new socks that are coming out of the sock

336
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:55,200
 factory.

337
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:58,660
 And it's actually very difficult to get a pair of socks into the new supply line of

338
00:14:58,660 --> 00:14:59,660
 socks.

339
00:14:59,660 --> 00:15:00,660
 And it's not worth it.

340
00:15:00,660 --> 00:15:03,260
 And you've got to get that weird plastic thing with the two little toggles on the end

341
00:15:03,260 --> 00:15:04,260
 through it again.

342
00:15:04,260 --> 00:15:07,420
 Well, I always include that in a separate envelope when I send it back, but still, I think it

343
00:15:07,420 --> 00:15:08,420
 doesn't do any good.

344
00:15:08,420 --> 00:15:13,080
 Are you only, like, by the pair of socks just to wear them once for sex, presumably, and

345
00:15:13,080 --> 00:15:14,880
 then send them back?

346
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:17,680
 Yeah, but it's a once-yearly thing, so it doesn't matter.

347
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:20,040
 It's a relatively low-impact thing.

348
00:15:20,040 --> 00:15:24,000
 But there was an amazing thing in the Atlantic about this whole system.

349
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:28,360
 So when you return an item, what we see as customers is you see the label you print out,

350
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:32,200
 you might hand it to a local shopkeeper and they post it off for you and you get the refund.

351
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:38,120
 But beyond that, there's this mad system that kicks in of liquidators and recyclers and

352
00:15:38,120 --> 00:15:39,120
 resellers.

353
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:42,780
 And they are shuffling it and, you know, sometimes they're reselling it.

354
00:15:42,780 --> 00:15:46,140
 And this is what the Atlantic says, "Deep within that system, in a processing facility

355
00:15:46,140 --> 00:15:51,180
 in the Lehigh Valley, a guy named Michael has to sniff your sweatpants."

356
00:15:51,180 --> 00:15:54,820
 Because they have these material, what they call material handlers who have to work out

357
00:15:54,820 --> 00:15:55,820
 what to do with it.

358
00:15:55,820 --> 00:15:56,820
 "Is this good to be sold on?

359
00:15:56,820 --> 00:15:57,820
 Is it fine?"

360
00:15:57,820 --> 00:16:00,260
 And so they'll look, they'll feel, they'll assess, and they'll take a big old sniff.

361
00:16:00,260 --> 00:16:02,620
 And they make them change their names, don't they, as part of the job.

362
00:16:02,620 --> 00:16:03,620
 It's all Michael.

363
00:16:03,620 --> 00:16:05,380
 It's Michael one, Michael two, Michael three.

364
00:16:05,380 --> 00:16:06,380
 Yeah.

365
00:16:06,380 --> 00:16:10,320
 And we should say, this is pretty much all online, is online, which has created this

366
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:11,840
 enormous industry.

367
00:16:11,840 --> 00:16:17,940
 But like you said, it has, it was begun, the habit of letting people refund their clothes,

368
00:16:17,940 --> 00:16:21,440
 no questions asked, in the early 20th century.

369
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:27,860
 And in fact, I think it was JC Penny stores, which are those big American department stores,

370
00:16:27,860 --> 00:16:32,560
 that was their innovation quite early on to basically say customers can bring anything

371
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:33,560
 back.

372
00:16:33,560 --> 00:16:38,860
 Just to the extent that people would bring stuff in that was clearly from another shop,

373
00:16:38,860 --> 00:16:40,360
 and then they'd refund it there.

374
00:16:40,360 --> 00:16:43,720
 And I think Walmart said the same thing, Walmart took tips from them, we're like, "Yep, we'll

375
00:16:43,720 --> 00:16:44,720
 take it back."

376
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:47,020
 They bring a pony back that they've got from the local state, just take it, give them a

377
00:16:47,020 --> 00:16:49,300
 refund, give them 10 grand, let them go on their merry way.

378
00:16:49,300 --> 00:16:50,300
 The customers always, right?

379
00:16:50,300 --> 00:16:53,720
 And I think the guy who founded Walmart worked at JC Penny, didn't he?

380
00:16:53,720 --> 00:16:54,720
 I think he did, yeah.

381
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:59,660
 And JC Penny, billionaire, who created an industry, do you know what the C in JC Penny

382
00:16:59,660 --> 00:17:00,660
 stood for?

383
00:17:00,660 --> 00:17:01,660
 Christmas.

384
00:17:01,660 --> 00:17:02,660
 Oh, no.

385
00:17:02,660 --> 00:17:03,660
 Cash.

386
00:17:03,660 --> 00:17:04,660
 Cash.

387
00:17:04,660 --> 00:17:05,660
 Cash Penny.

388
00:17:05,660 --> 00:17:06,660
 Cash Penny.

389
00:17:06,660 --> 00:17:07,660
 It's Cash Penny.

390
00:17:07,660 --> 00:17:08,660
 No.

391
00:17:08,660 --> 00:17:11,680
 Like the rich English family called Money Coots, which is Coots is the bank, it's, yeah, Cash

392
00:17:11,680 --> 00:17:12,680
 Penny.

393
00:17:12,680 --> 00:17:15,300
 I wish I could tell you what the J was, and I forgot to Google it.

394
00:17:15,300 --> 00:17:16,300
 It's James.

395
00:17:16,300 --> 00:17:17,800
 James Cash Penny.

396
00:17:17,800 --> 00:17:18,800
 Yeah.

397
00:17:18,800 --> 00:17:21,800
 All very rich words.

398
00:17:21,800 --> 00:17:29,520
 Do you know the practice of buying an item once and then returning it for refund deliberately?

399
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:33,440
 You buy it for a party, you wear it, you send it back pretending it didn't fit.

400
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:37,020
 It's called Wardrobe-ing, and all the companies refer to this.

401
00:17:37,020 --> 00:17:40,280
 If you read it on their websites, they'll be chatting to each other on the forums.

402
00:17:40,280 --> 00:17:42,800
 Oh, Wardrobe-ing is such an issue in our industry.

403
00:17:42,800 --> 00:17:44,200
 So stop Wardrobe-ing.

404
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:48,520
 It's so funny watching, because I'm in the queues, as I say, there needs to be a separate

405
00:17:48,520 --> 00:17:49,520
 line.

406
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:50,520
 I'm behind the...

407
00:17:50,520 --> 00:17:51,520
 Behind your wife?

408
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:52,520
 I'm behind my wife.

409
00:17:52,520 --> 00:17:57,060
 No, you're behind these extraordinarily hungover people who clearly have been partying all

410
00:17:57,060 --> 00:18:00,960
 night, and they're like, "It didn't fit.

411
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:01,960
 I need to return it."

412
00:18:01,960 --> 00:18:06,240
 You're like, "Dude, you literally are still drunk, and you're handing this back.

413
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:07,240
 Yeah, it's wild."

414
00:18:07,240 --> 00:18:08,240
 It does happen.

415
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:09,400
 They're not just with clothes, of course.

416
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:11,920
 You get refunds with all sorts of things these days.

417
00:18:11,920 --> 00:18:16,920
 On delivery services, like food delivery services, you can sometimes get a refund if there's

418
00:18:16,920 --> 00:18:21,240
 a problem with your meal, and these days, they're getting to a stage where they'll just often

419
00:18:21,240 --> 00:18:24,440
 give you the refund without that much evidence.

420
00:18:24,440 --> 00:18:29,860
 So there was a guy who got refunded his just eat order because he complained his ice cream

421
00:18:29,860 --> 00:18:30,860
 was cold.

422
00:18:30,860 --> 00:18:35,180
 It's like, "I'm going to want a refund."

423
00:18:35,180 --> 00:18:37,220
 It puts in, "What's your reason?"

424
00:18:37,220 --> 00:18:40,500
 He just made it up, made up a reason, and they just gave him the refund.

425
00:18:40,500 --> 00:18:43,620
 And then the retailer's the one who loses out.

426
00:18:43,620 --> 00:18:47,060
 Sometimes it does hurt your teeth.

427
00:18:47,060 --> 00:18:48,060
 Yeah.

428
00:18:48,060 --> 00:18:49,060
 It's too much.

429
00:18:49,060 --> 00:18:53,220
 There was also an exchange on Twitter that I saw where there was a customer who said,

430
00:18:53,220 --> 00:19:00,560
 "Hello, I ordered a dozen custom masks from you, however you only sent me 12."

431
00:19:00,560 --> 00:19:04,080
 It was a baker, though, wasn't it?

432
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:08,040
 There was, I read a lady who tried to get a refund off a holiday that she went on to

433
00:19:08,040 --> 00:19:09,040
 Spain.

434
00:19:09,040 --> 00:19:11,920
 She went to this hotel, and afterwards she wrote a complaint saying, "I want my money

435
00:19:11,920 --> 00:19:12,920
 back."

436
00:19:12,920 --> 00:19:13,920
 And they said, "Why?"

437
00:19:13,920 --> 00:19:17,360
 And she said, "There were too many Spanish people in the hotel."

438
00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:20,320
 And she was like, "Shouldn't they be on holiday somewhere else?

439
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:23,340
 What are they doing in my Spanish holiday?"

440
00:19:23,340 --> 00:19:25,620
 And they refused, obviously.

441
00:19:25,620 --> 00:19:29,500
 So we assume she's very xenophobic, but it could be she's just objected to the logic

442
00:19:29,500 --> 00:19:32,900
 of the fact that if you're going on holiday, surely it's not your own country.

443
00:19:32,900 --> 00:19:38,980
 I was looking at just sort of general returning gifts or refusing gifts as a way of looking

444
00:19:38,980 --> 00:19:39,980
 at this one.

445
00:19:39,980 --> 00:19:44,980
 So President Abraham Lincoln, he was offered some gifts in 1861 by the king of Siam who

446
00:19:44,980 --> 00:19:47,860
 said, "I would like to send you some elephants.

447
00:19:47,860 --> 00:19:49,080
 All you have to do is release them.

448
00:19:49,080 --> 00:19:51,920
 They will multiply across America.

449
00:19:51,920 --> 00:19:55,040
 If you give us a big ship and fill it with hay and water, we'll send loads of elephants

450
00:19:55,040 --> 00:19:56,040
 across to you.

451
00:19:56,040 --> 00:19:58,520
 And just let them loose and you'll have loads of, you know, within a century America will

452
00:19:58,520 --> 00:20:02,480
 be overrun with elephants and that'll be a really good thing for transportation purposes."

453
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:03,480
 Right.

454
00:20:03,480 --> 00:20:06,560
 Well, there are elephants in America now, so did he just say no or...?

455
00:20:06,560 --> 00:20:12,320
 He wrote back with the most diplomatic answer, like it sets a good standard for American presidents

456
00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:13,320
 in terms of diplomacy.

457
00:20:13,320 --> 00:20:17,720
 He wrote back saying, "Certainly America does not reach a latitude so low as to favour

458
00:20:17,720 --> 00:20:19,340
 the multiplication of the elephants."

459
00:20:19,340 --> 00:20:20,340
 Really?

460
00:20:20,340 --> 00:20:21,340
 But thank you so much anyway.

461
00:20:21,340 --> 00:20:24,660
 It was just a very subtle nice way.

462
00:20:24,660 --> 00:20:27,420
 Everyone always sent a letter in advance warning you what the present was they were going

463
00:20:27,420 --> 00:20:28,420
 to get you.

464
00:20:28,420 --> 00:20:29,900
 So you can send them for light rejection.

465
00:20:29,900 --> 00:20:34,860
 There was a guy in India who wanted a refund for a train ticket.

466
00:20:34,860 --> 00:20:41,700
 He'd been overcharged for a train ticket by 20 rupees, which was 25 cents, US cents.

467
00:20:41,700 --> 00:20:46,900
 And after 100 hearings, eventually he got his 20 rupees back.

468
00:20:46,900 --> 00:20:50,320
 Apparently his family tried to convince him that it was all pointless and a waste of time

469
00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:54,760
 and money, but he says it's not the money that matters.

470
00:20:54,760 --> 00:20:57,840
 This is a fight for justice and a fight against corruption.

471
00:20:57,840 --> 00:21:03,400
 That's the shittest Batman ever.

472
00:21:03,400 --> 00:21:09,440
 In fairness, the rail company was fined about US$200, which he got as well, so he got some

473
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:10,440
 money out of it.

474
00:21:10,440 --> 00:21:13,800
 But that still didn't play for the massive divorce proceedings that followed.

475
00:21:13,800 --> 00:21:18,860
 22 years of trying to get his 20 rupees back.

476
00:21:18,860 --> 00:21:21,660
 Customers complaining goes back a long way.

477
00:21:21,660 --> 00:21:22,660
 It's so exciting.

478
00:21:22,660 --> 00:21:25,420
 This is something that I think we've probably been aware of, but we've never mentioned on

479
00:21:25,420 --> 00:21:33,260
 the podcast that there's a demand for a refund that is on a clay tablet from 1750 BC.

480
00:21:33,260 --> 00:21:34,620
 It's one of the oldest ones we have.

481
00:21:34,620 --> 00:21:42,340
 It's a Mesopotamia, and it's so good because it's exactly like a TripAdvisor complaint today.

482
00:21:42,340 --> 00:21:47,840
 And it's a complaint to someone called Aya Naseer from a customer who's called Nani,

483
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:52,500
 and Nani has sent his servant to buy some copper ingots on his behalf.

484
00:21:52,500 --> 00:21:56,400
 And he considered the ingots substandard, and the complaint is just an explanation of

485
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:58,960
 how these ingots are very poor standard of ingots.

486
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:03,800
 But not only that, the servant was treated very poorly by the salesperson when he tried

487
00:22:03,800 --> 00:22:04,800
 to buy them.

488
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:08,600
 He'd been dreadfully rude to them, so apparently the salesperson has said, "Well, if you want

489
00:22:08,600 --> 00:22:09,600
 to take them, take them.

490
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:11,360
 If you don't want to take them, don't."

491
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:12,360
 And it was great.

492
00:22:12,360 --> 00:22:14,820
 And then saying, "You know, you must restore my money to me in full.

493
00:22:14,820 --> 00:22:15,900
 This isn't good enough."

494
00:22:15,900 --> 00:22:17,660
 And that's 4,000 years ago.

495
00:22:17,660 --> 00:22:27,780
 4,000 years we've been whinging.

496
00:22:27,780 --> 00:22:32,980
 It is time for us to move on to fact number three, and that is Andy.

497
00:22:32,980 --> 00:22:39,220
 My fact is there is a man in America who has tasted 500 kinds of banana and claims he has

498
00:22:39,220 --> 00:22:41,800
 special banana eyes.

499
00:22:41,800 --> 00:22:43,800
 He's called Gabriel Sachter-Smith.

500
00:22:43,800 --> 00:22:47,120
 He lives in Hawaii, and he was recently profiled in the New York Times, which is how I found

501
00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:48,120
 out about him.

502
00:22:48,120 --> 00:22:49,120
 He is a banana fan.

503
00:22:49,120 --> 00:22:50,120
 He's a banana farmer.

504
00:22:50,120 --> 00:22:51,360
 He's a big banana boy.

505
00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:55,920
 He just loves bananas, basically, and he hunts bananas around the world.

506
00:22:55,920 --> 00:22:56,920
 He hunts the rare bananas.

507
00:22:56,920 --> 00:22:57,920
 They're easy to catch, aren't they?

508
00:22:57,920 --> 00:22:58,920
 They're slow-moving.

509
00:22:58,920 --> 00:23:01,880
 But you've got to know what you're looking for.

510
00:23:01,880 --> 00:23:05,280
 You've got a spot and say, "I've never seen you before."

511
00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:09,160
 And so he grows 150 different varieties on his own.

512
00:23:09,160 --> 00:23:10,500
 He hunts new varieties.

513
00:23:10,500 --> 00:23:12,500
 I see you, like, special, weird-looking.

514
00:23:12,500 --> 00:23:16,500
 Like, rare ones that, you know, we've got one biggie, the Cavendish, that's the global

515
00:23:16,500 --> 00:23:17,500
 banana these days.

516
00:23:17,500 --> 00:23:19,780
 He's looking for the rare, the deep cuts.

517
00:23:19,780 --> 00:23:22,380
 And a lot of them don't look like a banana.

518
00:23:22,380 --> 00:23:23,900
 So some of them are egg-shaped.

519
00:23:23,900 --> 00:23:27,840
 Some of them are like, it's kind of like with potatoes as well.

520
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:31,060
 Like, there are potato hunters that go out there, and they go, "This is a potato.

521
00:23:31,060 --> 00:23:33,700
 It looks nothing like a potato."

522
00:23:33,700 --> 00:23:34,700
 It doesn't look nothing.

523
00:23:34,700 --> 00:23:36,580
 It doesn't look like a dinosaur, does it?

524
00:23:36,580 --> 00:23:40,880
 Yeah, no, but it does look like a tree, for example, like it just doesn't look like what

525
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:41,880
 it is.

526
00:23:41,880 --> 00:23:42,880
 And it's the same with this.

527
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:44,680
 So apparently this is what his brilliant skill is.

528
00:23:44,680 --> 00:23:49,640
 Wherever he is, he can just say, "Banana," and people go, "That's a postbox."

529
00:23:49,640 --> 00:23:50,640
 And they'll say, "No."

530
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:52,280
 I'll tell you, that's my wife.

531
00:23:52,280 --> 00:23:53,280
 It's a banana.

532
00:23:53,280 --> 00:23:57,520
 That's what his banana eyes are, that eyes that can spot a new variety of banana.

533
00:23:57,520 --> 00:23:58,520
 Yeah.

534
00:23:58,520 --> 00:24:02,880
 He tracks them down, and he has people guiding him as well who might know special local cultivars

535
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:03,880
 of banana.

536
00:24:03,880 --> 00:24:10,740
 So he's one of the world experts on it, and it's really useful because scientists have

537
00:24:10,740 --> 00:24:16,140
 a secret supply of support bananas, just in case something happens to the Cavendish,

538
00:24:16,140 --> 00:24:17,140
 which is our big variety.

539
00:24:17,140 --> 00:24:18,140
 A support?

540
00:24:18,140 --> 00:24:23,320
 Is that like a banana you bring on an aeroplane if you're slightly emotionally vulnerable?

541
00:24:23,320 --> 00:24:28,460
 He's sent 200 new bananas to a gene bank in Belgium, and they're cryo-preserved at minus

542
00:24:28,460 --> 00:24:29,460
 200 degrees.

543
00:24:29,460 --> 00:24:33,060
 They're like Hans Solo, just waiting to be thawed out in case of diet emergency.

544
00:24:33,060 --> 00:24:35,840
 But they're all like the Cavendish are just really tasty, right?

545
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:38,800
 And the other ones are just all rubbish, like little brown things.

546
00:24:38,800 --> 00:24:42,000
 Cavendish would be bred to be very tasty, haven't they?

547
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:47,040
 But they might be vulnerable to disease, although scientists are always working on reinforcing

548
00:24:47,040 --> 00:24:49,680
 the Cavendish to make sure that that can last as the banana.

549
00:24:49,680 --> 00:24:53,280
 So there's no imminent peril, I think.

550
00:24:53,280 --> 00:24:58,960
 I think I read there's 1,600 different varieties of banana in this vault that are like Austin

551
00:24:58,960 --> 00:24:59,960
 Powers.

552
00:24:59,960 --> 00:25:04,380
 They're sitting there waiting to wake up in a future that they won't understand, and

553
00:25:04,380 --> 00:25:07,260
 we'll say "cancelable things".

554
00:25:07,260 --> 00:25:11,620
 But it is amazing, like the science that is going on.

555
00:25:11,620 --> 00:25:13,580
 You think bananas are just in the wild?

556
00:25:13,580 --> 00:25:17,580
 No, we've got people protecting the banana at a huge scientific base.

557
00:25:17,580 --> 00:25:21,660
 Yeah, a lot is going into it, because it is a risk just because Cavendish are clones,

558
00:25:21,660 --> 00:25:25,060
 so they may not have anything threatening them now, but as soon as the threat comes,

559
00:25:25,060 --> 00:25:26,060
 they're all done.

560
00:25:26,060 --> 00:25:29,600
 And yeah, I love banana heroes who are really into it.

561
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:33,340
 Do you know who eats the most bananas in the world?

562
00:25:33,340 --> 00:25:36,040
 What nationality-wise, or individual-wise?

563
00:25:36,040 --> 00:25:38,680
 Yeah, the answer is monkeys.

564
00:25:38,680 --> 00:25:40,680
 No, which country?

565
00:25:40,680 --> 00:25:41,680
 Which country?

566
00:25:41,680 --> 00:25:45,360
 I mean, I'll be honest, you're not going to guess this in a million years.

567
00:25:45,360 --> 00:25:46,360
 Really?

568
00:25:46,360 --> 00:25:47,360
 Equatorial Guinea.

569
00:25:47,360 --> 00:25:48,360
 Is it per capita?

570
00:25:48,360 --> 00:25:49,360
 Oh, wouldn't it have been good?

571
00:25:49,360 --> 00:25:50,360
 That would have been amazing.

572
00:25:50,360 --> 00:25:51,360
 It was worth a try, wasn't it?

573
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:52,360
 I wouldn't say it was confidence.

574
00:25:52,360 --> 00:25:53,960
 This is per capita, yeah.

575
00:25:53,960 --> 00:25:54,960
 Australia?

576
00:25:54,960 --> 00:26:01,860
 Australia eats around one a week, one every five days, an average Australian would eat.

577
00:26:01,860 --> 00:26:02,860
 Okay.

578
00:26:02,860 --> 00:26:05,960
 Okay, and this is, can you tell us how much these people eat before we find out who they

579
00:26:05,960 --> 00:26:06,960
 are?

580
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:07,960
 Yeah, ten a day.

581
00:26:07,960 --> 00:26:08,960
 Get out.

582
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:09,960
 Eat?

583
00:26:09,960 --> 00:26:10,960
 It's just not true.

584
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:11,960
 It's so true.

585
00:26:11,960 --> 00:26:12,960
 People, oh, the Vatican.

586
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:13,960
 The Vatican is a huge...

587
00:26:13,960 --> 00:26:14,960
 The Pope.

588
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:21,560
 There's no end to that, just they love, they need the energy for the services, and you know...

589
00:26:21,560 --> 00:26:23,680
 What is the Pope doing with those bananas?

590
00:26:23,680 --> 00:26:24,680
 Yeah.

591
00:26:24,680 --> 00:26:28,640
 Well, it's a normal sized country, but you're not going to guess it, but you weren't a

592
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:30,800
 million miles away with Equatorial Guinea.

593
00:26:30,800 --> 00:26:31,800
 It's Uganda.

594
00:26:31,800 --> 00:26:32,800
 Uganda, yeah.

595
00:26:32,800 --> 00:26:39,080
 Uganda eats 660 pounds of bananas each year, which is about 3,000 per year on average per

596
00:26:39,080 --> 00:26:40,080
 person.

597
00:26:40,080 --> 00:26:43,940
 But the reason is because Ugandan food is basically banana-based.

598
00:26:43,940 --> 00:26:47,440
 So you have banana bread, you have banana...

599
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:51,400
 The most common banana dish, matoke, is also the word for food in Uganda.

600
00:26:51,400 --> 00:26:52,400
 Oh.

601
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:53,760
 You have Uganda beer.

602
00:26:53,760 --> 00:26:54,760
 You have...

603
00:26:54,760 --> 00:26:55,760
 You have...

604
00:26:55,760 --> 00:26:56,760
 Banana beer.

605
00:26:56,760 --> 00:26:57,760
 Banana beer.

606
00:26:57,760 --> 00:26:58,760
 I think I've had one too.

607
00:26:58,760 --> 00:26:59,760
 Many banana beers, maybe.

608
00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:01,920
 It's almost a problem, isn't it?

609
00:27:01,920 --> 00:27:04,960
 It makes up about 35% of the Ugandan diet.

610
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:11,840
 I think Uganda and Congo are the top two of these matukae bananas, which are cooking bananas.

611
00:27:11,840 --> 00:27:16,000
 So more like plantain, I guess, but it's a bit of an issue.

612
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:17,000
 People get deficiencies.

613
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:20,360
 So there's a lot of vitamin A deficiency problems, because so much of their diet is

614
00:27:20,360 --> 00:27:22,000
 based on bananas that doesn't have enough.

615
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:27,600
 So they've now made a super banana specifically for Uganda, which is a banana that has 30

616
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:33,840
 times as much vitamin A as the normal banana, and could solve a lot of their problems, which

617
00:27:33,840 --> 00:27:34,840
 is very cool.

618
00:27:34,840 --> 00:27:35,840
 But people don't want to eat it.

619
00:27:35,840 --> 00:27:37,920
 There's suspicion, because it's a little bit orange.

620
00:27:37,920 --> 00:27:42,520
 So sellers are saying people are coming to us saying, "We just want the natural banana.

621
00:27:42,520 --> 00:27:43,880
 This banana's gone orange.

622
00:27:43,880 --> 00:27:44,880
 What's wrong with it?"

623
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:45,880
 Yeah.

624
00:27:45,880 --> 00:27:46,880
 Well, it feels like you could just paint it.

625
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:49,720
 I think that might take away some of the nutritional value.

626
00:27:49,720 --> 00:27:50,720
 Well, it doesn't.

627
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:51,720
 It's on the skin.

628
00:27:51,720 --> 00:27:52,720
 You take it off.

629
00:27:52,720 --> 00:27:53,720
 You take the skin off.

630
00:27:53,720 --> 00:27:54,720
 No, no.

631
00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:55,720
 Sorry.

632
00:27:55,720 --> 00:27:56,720
 It's the flesh.

633
00:27:56,720 --> 00:27:57,720
 The flesh is orange.

634
00:27:57,720 --> 00:27:58,720
 Yeah, sorry.

635
00:27:58,720 --> 00:27:59,720
 Do you want to hear about the Highland Giant Banana?

636
00:27:59,720 --> 00:28:00,720
 Yes, please.

637
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:02,640
 Is it a real or is it like a cryptid?

638
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:03,640
 It's real.

639
00:28:03,640 --> 00:28:04,640
 Oh.

640
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:05,640
 It's the biggest banana on the planet.

641
00:28:05,640 --> 00:28:07,720
 I wish it was a cryptid, though, because I'd love that.

642
00:28:07,720 --> 00:28:08,960
 I believe in that monster.

643
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:09,960
 Well, you decide.

644
00:28:09,960 --> 00:28:12,120
 I'll tell you about it, and you decide if it's real or not.

645
00:28:12,120 --> 00:28:15,080
 So it's called Musa Ingans, is the scientific name.

646
00:28:15,080 --> 00:28:20,680
 It's the biggest non-woody plant on the planet, because it's not woody bananas or herbs, they're

647
00:28:20,680 --> 00:28:21,680
 not trees.

648
00:28:21,680 --> 00:28:22,680
 Yeah.

649
00:28:22,680 --> 00:28:28,520
 But it's 45 feet tall, and because it's not wood, it gets knocked over by the wind very

650
00:28:28,520 --> 00:28:29,520
 easily.

651
00:28:29,520 --> 00:28:32,800
 So it only grows in very deep jungle canyons in Papua New Guinea.

652
00:28:32,800 --> 00:28:33,800
 Cool.

653
00:28:33,800 --> 00:28:34,800
 Yeah.

654
00:28:34,800 --> 00:28:35,800
 And the fruit are very big.

655
00:28:35,800 --> 00:28:36,800
 Wow.

656
00:28:36,800 --> 00:28:40,400
 I bet the Pope fucking loves them.

657
00:28:40,400 --> 00:28:45,040
 I didn't write down a measurement for the fruit.

658
00:28:45,040 --> 00:28:46,040
 What was I thinking?

659
00:28:46,040 --> 00:28:49,560
 I just thought I'd cover it at the end by saying, "And they're very big."

660
00:28:49,560 --> 00:28:52,480
 I've seen photos of them, and they are massive.

661
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:54,440
 Because we've all seen big trees, Andy.

662
00:28:54,440 --> 00:28:55,440
 It's a big banana.

663
00:28:55,440 --> 00:28:56,440
 They're little people.

664
00:28:56,440 --> 00:28:57,440
 No, this big.

665
00:28:57,440 --> 00:28:58,440
 Whoa.

666
00:28:58,440 --> 00:29:02,960
 He's gone for almost the length of a human arm, I would say, the teenager's arm.

667
00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:04,600
 Size of a chihuahua, I would say.

668
00:29:04,600 --> 00:29:07,760
 Size of a very, like, overfed chihuahua, I tell you.

669
00:29:07,760 --> 00:29:08,760
 Yeah.

670
00:29:08,760 --> 00:29:09,760
 Yeah.

671
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:10,760
 Because they're fat.

672
00:29:10,760 --> 00:29:13,160
 Hey, one interesting thing about the fact that bananas are herbs, right, is they don't

673
00:29:13,160 --> 00:29:15,960
 have a trunk like a normal tree would do.

674
00:29:15,960 --> 00:29:18,280
 They have, they're not a woody stem.

675
00:29:18,280 --> 00:29:22,600
 And so when you see a banana tree, you'll see, like, at the top, the leaves are all

676
00:29:22,600 --> 00:29:25,880
 kind of shredded, like it's been in a hurricane.

677
00:29:25,880 --> 00:29:28,640
 But that's to help it if it's ever in a hurricane.

678
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:33,600
 Because when the wind blows it, because they don't have the wooden stems, the kind of,

679
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:35,640
 they might blow over quite easily.

680
00:29:35,640 --> 00:29:39,040
 And because they've got these kind of tattered leaves, it means that the wind can get right

681
00:29:39,040 --> 00:29:40,040
 through them.

682
00:29:40,040 --> 00:29:41,040
 That's pretty clever.

683
00:29:41,040 --> 00:29:42,040
 That's cool, isn't it?

684
00:29:42,040 --> 00:29:43,040
 That's so good.

685
00:29:43,040 --> 00:29:48,400
 And Britain is another nation that loves bananas, currently and historically.

686
00:29:48,400 --> 00:29:53,080
 So Britain bananas in Jamaica have a very intertwined history.

687
00:29:53,080 --> 00:29:58,440
 It was a huge export from Jamaica to Britain around the turn of the 20th century.

688
00:29:58,440 --> 00:30:03,840
 And in World War II, Britain had to suddenly requisition all of its, or a lot of its trade

689
00:30:03,840 --> 00:30:06,000
 ships to be used in the military.

690
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:10,240
 So that included the ships that were bringing bananas from Jamaica to the UK.

691
00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:12,420
 But that was going to screw Jamaica's economy.

692
00:30:12,420 --> 00:30:16,800
 So basically, Jamaica kept on churning out loads and loads of bananas for Britain, put

693
00:30:16,800 --> 00:30:20,320
 them on a ship, and then immediately just tipped them all into the ocean.

694
00:30:20,320 --> 00:30:21,320
 What?

695
00:30:21,320 --> 00:30:22,520
 The ocean was just full of bananas.

696
00:30:22,520 --> 00:30:26,720
 If you went for a swim off the beaches of Jamaica in World War II, it was just bananas

697
00:30:26,720 --> 00:30:27,720
 layering.

698
00:30:27,720 --> 00:30:28,720
 And that's how the banana boat was invented.

699
00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:31,000
 And that's what it is, yes.

700
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:32,000
 Yeah.

701
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:33,000
 Honestly, that's amazing.

702
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:34,000
 It's so cool.

703
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:36,280
 And they were, of course, they were rationed in Britain, well, you couldn't get

704
00:30:36,280 --> 00:30:38,480
 them in Britain because they weren't being imported.

705
00:30:38,480 --> 00:30:41,800
 And there was this panic that Brits would have lost their taste for bananas because the whole

706
00:30:41,800 --> 00:30:47,100
 generation grew up without, and rationing famously, went on in Britain until about 1950.

707
00:30:47,100 --> 00:30:51,940
 So when the ban was lifted, the first shipment of bananas arrived into Liverpool, actually

708
00:30:51,940 --> 00:30:55,820
 from Sierra Leone, they arrived and the bananas were overripe.

709
00:30:55,820 --> 00:30:59,220
 They didn't want to throw them away because, you know, that's a waste, and what do you

710
00:30:59,220 --> 00:31:00,220
 do with them?

711
00:31:00,220 --> 00:31:01,220
 Big banana bread.

712
00:31:01,220 --> 00:31:03,820
 So they said, oh, they should have done a big loaf.

713
00:31:03,820 --> 00:31:04,820
 They didn't.

714
00:31:04,820 --> 00:31:07,340
 They just got all the dot workers, and they said, can you eat as many of these as you

715
00:31:07,340 --> 00:31:08,340
 can?

716
00:31:08,340 --> 00:31:09,340
 Oh, really?

717
00:31:09,340 --> 00:31:10,340
 So they went through 37,000.

718
00:31:10,340 --> 00:31:13,340
 They ate 12 bananas each.

719
00:31:13,340 --> 00:31:14,340
 Call the Vatican.

720
00:31:14,340 --> 00:31:17,340
 We have a banana emergency.

721
00:31:17,340 --> 00:31:18,340
 Okay.

722
00:31:18,340 --> 00:31:19,340
 Yellow.

723
00:31:19,340 --> 00:31:25,040
 So the Ecuadorian banana is a little too big for Britain.

724
00:31:25,040 --> 00:31:26,040
 Oh.

725
00:31:26,040 --> 00:31:27,040
 So I read a really interesting interview.

726
00:31:27,040 --> 00:31:28,040
 What does that mean?

727
00:31:28,040 --> 00:31:30,540
 Well, I would read a great interview with the managing director of Fife's in the UK.

728
00:31:30,540 --> 00:31:34,420
 They're a great big banana company, and he's called John Hawkins, and he said, the Ecuadorian

729
00:31:34,420 --> 00:31:37,000
 banana is a bit too big for the UK market.

730
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:40,520
 It's only a couple of centimetres that it's too big, but it's enough for the housewife

731
00:31:40,520 --> 00:31:43,540
 to say it's more than a meal.

732
00:31:43,540 --> 00:31:47,660
 Whereas he says, I'm not trying to put any emphasis on any of this, but he says the German

733
00:31:47,660 --> 00:31:51,060
 housefraut loves the length of an Ecuadorian banana.

734
00:31:51,060 --> 00:31:54,620
 Well, she needs to take due after all those broken penises.

735
00:31:54,620 --> 00:31:58,900
 I'm going to have to move this on and say, guys.

736
00:31:58,900 --> 00:32:03,500
 You don't want to hear about the ratio shifting ratio between British banana and turlip consumption.

737
00:32:03,500 --> 00:32:08,960
 Screw this time frame, we've said ourselves.

738
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:09,960
 Go Andy, go.

739
00:32:09,960 --> 00:32:10,960
 Fly my friend.

740
00:32:10,960 --> 00:32:11,960
 Fly my beauty.

741
00:32:11,960 --> 00:32:19,840
 Listen, better be good.

742
00:32:19,840 --> 00:32:32,080
 It's just that in the 1970s, the average British adult ate 84 grams of bananas each week and

743
00:32:32,080 --> 00:32:34,180
 40 grams of turlip.

744
00:32:34,180 --> 00:32:41,780
 But now we, well, steady, steady, that's just the set up.

745
00:32:41,780 --> 00:32:49,620
 Now we eat 200 grams of banana each week and just 12 grams of turlip.

746
00:32:49,620 --> 00:33:00,700
 It's so sad.

747
00:33:00,700 --> 00:33:02,960
 And it's time for our final fact of the show.

748
00:33:02,960 --> 00:33:04,480
 And that is James.

749
00:33:04,480 --> 00:33:05,480
 Okay.

750
00:33:05,480 --> 00:33:11,240
 My fact this week is that neo toddlerism is the idea that you can change the world by

751
00:33:11,240 --> 00:33:14,780
 acting like a three year old.

752
00:33:14,780 --> 00:33:15,780
 Okay.

753
00:33:15,780 --> 00:33:24,760
 And I must admit, I did come up with this fact before the recent events in America.

754
00:33:24,760 --> 00:33:25,760
 What's happened?

755
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:27,320
 I've not seen the news.

756
00:33:27,320 --> 00:33:28,960
 Don't worry about it, Dan.

757
00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:33,940
 So this comes from an article by a blogger called Govinda Bogle.

758
00:33:33,940 --> 00:33:36,300
 It seems like he came up with the idea.

759
00:33:36,300 --> 00:33:41,040
 He is, he writes about psychology and the modern world and stuff like that.

760
00:33:41,040 --> 00:33:46,420
 And he came up with the idea that it's like, you know, you get people who are throwing

761
00:33:46,420 --> 00:33:53,180
 super paintings or going to the Republican convention dressed as babies.

762
00:33:53,180 --> 00:33:57,860
 And they reckon basically you're trying to, you're having to do these stunts because

763
00:33:57,860 --> 00:34:00,600
 of the world of tick tock and the world of social media.

764
00:34:00,600 --> 00:34:03,160
 And you're just trying to get a reaction just like a toddler would.

765
00:34:03,160 --> 00:34:07,200
 You're just trying to get people to look at you, get people to see what you're doing.

766
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:08,200
 And that is the way to.

767
00:34:08,200 --> 00:34:09,200
 I see.

768
00:34:09,200 --> 00:34:10,200
 So it's about protest, basically.

769
00:34:10,200 --> 00:34:11,200
 It's about protest.

770
00:34:11,200 --> 00:34:14,160
 Not about people who are in charge acting like toddlers themselves.

771
00:34:14,160 --> 00:34:19,040
 No, it's not so much that it's the, it's the modern way of protesting in order to defeat

772
00:34:19,040 --> 00:34:21,520
 toddlers is by using other toddlers, right?

773
00:34:21,520 --> 00:34:23,680
 So maybe it's the best way to protest.

774
00:34:23,680 --> 00:34:24,680
 Is that how you do it?

775
00:34:24,680 --> 00:34:25,760
 Like a war of toddlers?

776
00:34:25,760 --> 00:34:26,760
 Yes.

777
00:34:26,760 --> 00:34:27,760
 Fire is fire.

778
00:34:27,760 --> 00:34:28,760
 The toddler is his toddlers.

779
00:34:28,760 --> 00:34:32,620
 Whenever my child misbehaves, I bring in the village terror child.

780
00:34:32,620 --> 00:34:39,240
 But I hear about all these different theories and I just like the idea of neo-toddlerism

781
00:34:39,240 --> 00:34:41,620
 and I just like the idea of acting like a toddler.

782
00:34:41,620 --> 00:34:43,740
 You just want us all to do it protest still or not?

783
00:34:43,740 --> 00:34:45,260
 I just like having naps.

784
00:34:45,260 --> 00:34:46,260
 Yeah.

785
00:34:46,260 --> 00:34:47,260
 Okay.

786
00:34:47,260 --> 00:34:50,700
 That no one's protested by just having a nap every afternoon for two hours yet.

787
00:34:50,700 --> 00:34:51,700
 But they could.

788
00:34:51,700 --> 00:34:52,700
 Yeah.

789
00:34:52,700 --> 00:34:53,700
 He's very critical of it.

790
00:34:53,700 --> 00:34:59,000
 And, you know, says that he uses some examples of protests that have been happening at the

791
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:00,000
 moment.

792
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:04,760
 You know, people in just up oil often through paint over paintings, ironically, to destroy

793
00:35:04,760 --> 00:35:05,760
 them.

794
00:35:05,760 --> 00:35:10,800
 And it's often soup over paintings, but they never throw a painting at a bowl of soup.

795
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:12,840
 No, they're not trying to destroy soup.

796
00:35:12,840 --> 00:35:13,840
 Are they?

797
00:35:13,840 --> 00:35:14,840
 But I would be interested in that.

798
00:35:14,840 --> 00:35:17,040
 Like as a, just a, you know, cool variation on the thing.

799
00:35:17,040 --> 00:35:21,480
 The interesting thing that I read in no is they literally never even harm the paintings.

800
00:35:21,480 --> 00:35:23,860
 There's one painting which they very mildly harmed.

801
00:35:23,860 --> 00:35:26,300
 So I think it is quite interesting or the fuss about it.

802
00:35:26,300 --> 00:35:31,660
 But the other thing that this guy's point is that it's very impulsive and over-emotional

803
00:35:31,660 --> 00:35:36,420
 and not very thoughtful protest, but he uses an example, things like the release of worms

804
00:35:36,420 --> 00:35:40,160
 and maggots into Netanyahu's hotel room at the Watergate.

805
00:35:40,160 --> 00:35:42,140
 And that takes a huge amount of forward planning.

806
00:35:42,140 --> 00:35:43,140
 Yeah.

807
00:35:43,140 --> 00:35:46,740
 I wouldn't be able to, where are you sourcing a huge number of worms and maggots?

808
00:35:46,740 --> 00:35:50,500
 I was trying to look for worms recently and it takes ages even to find one.

809
00:35:50,500 --> 00:35:51,500
 You're in the ground, Anna.

810
00:35:51,500 --> 00:35:52,500
 Yeah.

811
00:35:52,500 --> 00:35:53,500
 Okay.

812
00:35:53,500 --> 00:35:55,000
 How much do you find enough to overwhelm a hotel room?

813
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:59,560
 I don't think he opened the door and a wall of worms fell out on top of it.

814
00:35:59,560 --> 00:36:00,560
 And maggots.

815
00:36:00,560 --> 00:36:04,720
 There's a maximum happy number of worms in your hotel room, which is zero.

816
00:36:04,720 --> 00:36:07,300
 So any advance on that is technically a good process.

817
00:36:07,300 --> 00:36:08,300
 Yeah.

818
00:36:08,300 --> 00:36:09,300
 But it can't be just two, can it?

819
00:36:09,300 --> 00:36:11,320
 He's not going to walk in and go, "Waaaaaah!"

820
00:36:11,320 --> 00:36:12,320
 Yeah.

821
00:36:12,320 --> 00:36:15,200
 Well, as soon as he tries to cut them up to throw them away, he's got four worms.

822
00:36:15,200 --> 00:36:16,200
 So that's true.

823
00:36:16,200 --> 00:36:21,240
 Do you know, the idea that they're not forward planning is not strictly true.

824
00:36:21,240 --> 00:36:25,880
 So the very famous incident that happened in London not too long ago was Van Gogh's

825
00:36:25,880 --> 00:36:27,380
 Sunflowers.

826
00:36:27,380 --> 00:36:32,140
 Anna Holland and Phoebe Plummer, they came in and they threw tomato soup at it.

827
00:36:32,140 --> 00:36:35,340
 But they went in and they staked the joint.

828
00:36:35,340 --> 00:36:39,060
 They went a few days before and they brought in cans of tomato soup to see if that would

829
00:36:39,060 --> 00:36:40,700
 make it past security.

830
00:36:40,700 --> 00:36:44,860
 They went back to an Airbnb that they were staying in and they went into the showers

831
00:36:44,860 --> 00:36:50,320
 in there and had to work out at what angle do you throw tin soup at an item?

832
00:36:50,320 --> 00:36:51,320
 Really?

833
00:36:51,320 --> 00:36:52,320
 Yeah.

834
00:36:52,320 --> 00:36:53,720
 So they went in and they tried all the different things that you could do.

835
00:36:53,720 --> 00:36:58,160
 They had it all planned out to the point where there were journalists planted in there.

836
00:36:58,160 --> 00:36:59,520
 So that's how much forward thinking was.

837
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:04,120
 They informed media who were waiting silently knowing that this was going to happen.

838
00:37:04,120 --> 00:37:07,720
 But there was a bunch of kids who were sitting and doing their own little sketches of it.

839
00:37:07,720 --> 00:37:12,840
 So they had to wait ages for these kids to do these drawings and eventually they moved

840
00:37:12,840 --> 00:37:16,300
 away and they threw the soup, it went on it.

841
00:37:16,300 --> 00:37:20,140
 They glued their hands to the wall and then they got arrested, right?

842
00:37:20,140 --> 00:37:22,380
 Now they thought that they were going to get off because they thought there was a good

843
00:37:22,380 --> 00:37:23,380
 point to it.

844
00:37:23,380 --> 00:37:25,740
 They have been found guilty and they are serving time.

845
00:37:25,740 --> 00:37:30,700
 And the thing that they got busted for is that the frame that was housing the Van Gogh

846
00:37:30,700 --> 00:37:34,580
 painting was incredibly old, 1700s.

847
00:37:34,580 --> 00:37:39,100
 It was incredibly expensive and the soup went on it and the acid burnt away a bunch of the

848
00:37:39,100 --> 00:37:40,100
 frames.

849
00:37:40,100 --> 00:37:41,100
 Yeah.

850
00:37:41,100 --> 00:37:43,300
 So do they put it in my Heinz tomato soup?

851
00:37:43,300 --> 00:37:48,060
 Sorry, when I spill a little bit of soup it doesn't burn through my table.

852
00:37:48,060 --> 00:37:49,460
 It's a good point.

853
00:37:49,460 --> 00:37:50,780
 It's an excellent point.

854
00:37:50,780 --> 00:37:53,500
 Do you know why just a pile use orange?

855
00:37:53,500 --> 00:37:56,140
 So they often do orange paint in their things.

856
00:37:56,140 --> 00:37:57,140
 Shows up well?

857
00:37:57,140 --> 00:37:58,220
 Shows up well, definitely.

858
00:37:58,220 --> 00:37:59,640
 In fact, I will come to that.

859
00:37:59,640 --> 00:38:04,500
 So they say it's a symbol of hope because it's a bright colour, all this.

860
00:38:04,500 --> 00:38:09,360
 But actually orange has been used in environmental protests for quite a long time and that is

861
00:38:09,360 --> 00:38:13,420
 because green and orange are clashing colours.

862
00:38:13,420 --> 00:38:17,700
 So green and red are complementary colours, they're exactly opposite on the colour wheel.

863
00:38:17,700 --> 00:38:22,500
 But if you just go one away from red, suddenly the colours really, really clash.

864
00:38:22,500 --> 00:38:27,220
 And so for ages and ages it's always been used in green protest because it looks very

865
00:38:27,220 --> 00:38:29,540
 artificial because it looks the opposite of green.

866
00:38:29,540 --> 00:38:32,660
 And did you deliberately wear a green and orange shirt tonight that everyone's been

867
00:38:32,660 --> 00:38:35,220
 having to look at for the last hour and a half already?

868
00:38:35,220 --> 00:38:36,860
 I'm done as well.

869
00:38:36,860 --> 00:38:37,860
 Jesus Christ.

870
00:38:37,860 --> 00:38:41,800
 Jesus Christ, you haven't seen Andy's underpants.

871
00:38:41,800 --> 00:38:43,800
 Thank God.

872
00:38:43,800 --> 00:38:47,840
 I was looking at protests, what works, what doesn't.

873
00:38:47,840 --> 00:38:51,560
 And there was this really interesting study that came out quite recently by a Harvard

874
00:38:51,560 --> 00:38:56,880
 academic called Erica Chenoweth who she found that nonviolent campaigns twice as likely

875
00:38:56,880 --> 00:39:00,760
 to achieve their goals as violent campaigns, which is quite useful and all these campaigns

876
00:39:00,760 --> 00:39:04,040
 that are being referred to, then it's not violent unless you count kind of drenching

877
00:39:04,040 --> 00:39:07,800
 something in a tasty liquid as violence.

878
00:39:07,800 --> 00:39:13,660
 And the really interesting revelation she had, and she looked at a lot of sort of successful

879
00:39:13,660 --> 00:39:18,460
 protests basically where they've stated their aim and then their aim has been achieved,

880
00:39:18,460 --> 00:39:23,900
 found that as soon as 3.5% of the population is actively involved in a movement, the success

881
00:39:23,900 --> 00:39:25,340
 rate is 100%.

882
00:39:25,340 --> 00:39:26,340
 Wow.

883
00:39:26,340 --> 00:39:27,340
 Wow.

884
00:39:27,340 --> 00:39:31,180
 And she looked at, I think it was over, it was a couple of hundred, I think, protests.

885
00:39:31,180 --> 00:39:34,820
 So in Australia, for instance, that's about a million people.

886
00:39:34,820 --> 00:39:39,280
 If you have a cause, if you're really popular, you can rope in a million people, 100% chance

887
00:39:39,280 --> 00:39:40,360
 it's going to work.

888
00:39:40,360 --> 00:39:44,280
 It's the same number of people who will go on a cruise ship holiday this year in Australia.

889
00:39:44,280 --> 00:39:45,800
 So if you've got all of them.

890
00:39:45,800 --> 00:39:52,580
 Just tell them you're not returning to shore until you sign the petition, yeah.

891
00:39:52,580 --> 00:39:57,040
 Some things that toddlers are good at, 10 pin bowling.

892
00:39:57,040 --> 00:39:58,040
 So the world's...

893
00:39:58,040 --> 00:39:59,040
 In what capacity?

894
00:39:59,040 --> 00:40:00,040
 Well.

895
00:40:00,040 --> 00:40:01,040
 Are they?

896
00:40:01,040 --> 00:40:06,380
 Possibly the world's best 10 pin bowler is an Aussie called Jason Belmontay from New

897
00:40:06,380 --> 00:40:07,740
 South Wales.

898
00:40:07,740 --> 00:40:16,240
 He's won 31 world titles and he bowls like a child because when he was a toddler, that's

899
00:40:16,240 --> 00:40:20,760
 when he learned he wasn't strong enough to lift up the ball with one hand and roll it.

900
00:40:20,760 --> 00:40:25,100
 So he used two hands and sort of rolled it that way and he carried it on his whole life

901
00:40:25,100 --> 00:40:26,860
 and now he's the best in the world.

902
00:40:26,860 --> 00:40:27,860
 Wow.

903
00:40:27,860 --> 00:40:28,860
 Get out.

904
00:40:28,860 --> 00:40:29,860
 It's plausible.

905
00:40:29,860 --> 00:40:32,480
 The number of times I've been bowling, are you not the same?

906
00:40:32,480 --> 00:40:37,520
 And you go for like a really graceful long hard bowl and it just tips one over and you

907
00:40:37,520 --> 00:40:41,400
 have the idiot who's never done it before who bumps it along and knocks them all down.

908
00:40:41,400 --> 00:40:44,680
 He's the only 30 time winner in PBA Tour history.

909
00:40:44,680 --> 00:40:47,080
 He does use those barriers.

910
00:40:47,080 --> 00:40:48,080
 What?

911
00:40:48,080 --> 00:40:49,080
 No, he doesn't.

912
00:40:49,080 --> 00:40:56,480
 I was so angry then.

913
00:40:56,480 --> 00:40:57,480
 It's allowed.

914
00:40:57,480 --> 00:40:59,300
 It's a little known rule of bowling.

915
00:40:59,300 --> 00:41:01,860
 They're not allowed to turn you down.

916
00:41:01,860 --> 00:41:05,220
 Can I tell you guys about my favorite protest that I've learned about?

917
00:41:05,220 --> 00:41:11,640
 So we all probably remember back in the day when the Beatles were sort of at their height,

918
00:41:11,640 --> 00:41:18,220
 1966, John Lennon made some comments where he said that we are bigger than Christ, right?

919
00:41:18,220 --> 00:41:23,380
 And this angered so many people to the point that the Beatles were being boycotted by radio

920
00:41:23,380 --> 00:41:24,380
 stations.

921
00:41:24,380 --> 00:41:27,760
 They were burning their stuff, burning all their records in all of John Lennon's books.

922
00:41:27,760 --> 00:41:33,760
 In particular, there was a radio station called Clue and Clue organized a bonfire.

923
00:41:33,760 --> 00:41:35,520
 So it had a thousand people there.

924
00:41:35,520 --> 00:41:36,960
 They all threw in their records.

925
00:41:36,960 --> 00:41:38,280
 It all burnt and so on.

926
00:41:38,280 --> 00:41:40,720
 That's a famous story that happened.

927
00:41:40,720 --> 00:41:42,560
 This next bit is less famous.

928
00:41:42,560 --> 00:41:49,480
 There is a theory that God agreed with John Lennon theory.

929
00:41:49,480 --> 00:41:51,640
 You're going to have to continue with that.

930
00:41:51,640 --> 00:41:54,500
 Otherwise you've just said nonsense.

931
00:41:54,500 --> 00:41:57,220
 So what happened is they did the bonfire, they burned all their stuff.

932
00:41:57,220 --> 00:42:01,820
 No, the next day, Clue's transmitter tower was struck by lightning.

933
00:42:01,820 --> 00:42:05,860
 All the equipment was knocked out completely and their news director, who's basically running

934
00:42:05,860 --> 00:42:11,500
 the whole thing, got hit, got knocked out and rushed to hospital and they didn't get back

935
00:42:11,500 --> 00:42:13,100
 on for another day or so.

936
00:42:13,100 --> 00:42:18,620
 So God was effectively going, "I love the Beatles."

937
00:42:18,620 --> 00:42:19,620
 It's a theory.

938
00:42:19,620 --> 00:42:22,320
 That's Old Testament God, isn't it?

939
00:42:22,320 --> 00:42:25,360
 It's a proper Old School God.

940
00:42:25,360 --> 00:42:26,480
 I say it's a popular theory.

941
00:42:26,480 --> 00:42:31,120
 I sort of invented it for this show, but I think it's got legs.

942
00:42:31,120 --> 00:42:35,360
 Just another 999,999 people to convince.

943
00:42:35,360 --> 00:42:41,120
 Do you want to hear some toddler things, sort of genuine toddlers?

944
00:42:41,120 --> 00:42:44,720
 I don't know if any of you are familiar with the Reddit of why my kid is crying, but it's

945
00:42:44,720 --> 00:42:45,720
 unbelievably good.

946
00:42:45,720 --> 00:42:48,820
 I just picked a few favorite examples.

947
00:42:48,820 --> 00:42:55,120
 Because I wouldn't let her eat a snotty tissue, both three-year-olds were inconsolable because

948
00:42:55,120 --> 00:42:58,820
 they wanted to hold the bag of poo I was taking to the bin.

949
00:42:58,820 --> 00:43:02,220
 And maybe my favorite, why is my kid crying?

950
00:43:02,220 --> 00:43:07,900
 Because Daddy's fart was louder than hers.

951
00:43:07,900 --> 00:43:09,460
 It's a very vulnerable age.

952
00:43:09,460 --> 00:43:10,980
 You've got to be careful.

953
00:43:10,980 --> 00:43:12,860
 You've got to be careful, yeah.

954
00:43:12,860 --> 00:43:18,560
 I find it very interesting the different levels at which toddlers develop and how it actually

955
00:43:18,560 --> 00:43:21,320
 is basically even across the world.

956
00:43:21,320 --> 00:43:27,400
 So the age at which kids walk is pretty much even maybe give or take a week or two weeks

957
00:43:27,400 --> 00:43:30,160
 across the world, except in Tajikistan.

958
00:43:30,160 --> 00:43:31,160
 What?

959
00:43:31,160 --> 00:43:32,160
 Yeah.

960
00:43:32,160 --> 00:43:33,160
 It's so weird.

961
00:43:33,160 --> 00:43:34,160
 What?

962
00:43:34,160 --> 00:43:37,720
 And there's this amazing thing that every single Tajik parent does pretty much, which

963
00:43:37,720 --> 00:43:43,300
 is that they have these things called Gavoras, which are cradles, but their kids stay in

964
00:43:43,300 --> 00:43:44,300
 all the time.

965
00:43:44,300 --> 00:43:47,340
 So for the first six months of their life, their kids are in it literally for 23 hours

966
00:43:47,340 --> 00:43:48,340
 a day.

967
00:43:48,340 --> 00:43:53,260
 For the next six months, it's more like maybe 16 hours a day.

968
00:43:53,260 --> 00:43:58,780
 And they're lying in a cradle and they're strapped down fully, so only their head moves.

969
00:43:58,780 --> 00:44:02,740
 And there's a hole cut in the bottom of the cradle, and they've got a bare bottom.

970
00:44:02,740 --> 00:44:06,340
 And so any poo just falls out into a bucket underneath.

971
00:44:06,340 --> 00:44:10,880
 And there's a tube attached to them so that any wee gets siphoned into wherever it gets

972
00:44:10,880 --> 00:44:11,880
 siphoned.

973
00:44:11,880 --> 00:44:12,880
 What?

974
00:44:12,880 --> 00:44:13,880
 And this is how they live.

975
00:44:13,880 --> 00:44:15,320
 And this is what all Tajik mothers do.

976
00:44:15,320 --> 00:44:17,440
 Almost 100% of Tajik mothers do this.

977
00:44:17,440 --> 00:44:21,600
 And they spend nine to 23 hours a day in it until they're three or four.

978
00:44:21,600 --> 00:44:24,320
 So understandably, they are a bit slower to crawl.

979
00:44:24,320 --> 00:44:29,720
 So by the age of one, almost all infants in most cultures are crawling.

980
00:44:29,720 --> 00:44:32,240
 Only 60% of Tajik children do it.

981
00:44:32,240 --> 00:44:35,840
 The good news is the fascinating thing is that by four, they've all caught up.

982
00:44:35,840 --> 00:44:39,780
 So it doesn't really make a blind bit of difference, these things, when you're thinking, "Oh, my

983
00:44:39,780 --> 00:44:41,640
 child's not talking or walking."

984
00:44:41,640 --> 00:44:42,640
 But isn't that mad?

985
00:44:42,640 --> 00:44:47,020
 Their kids are just strapped to a cradle with a poo hole in the bottom for three years,

986
00:44:47,020 --> 00:44:48,620
 the first three years of their life.

987
00:44:48,620 --> 00:44:49,620
 That is crazy.

988
00:44:49,620 --> 00:44:50,620
 Insane.

989
00:44:50,620 --> 00:44:51,620
 I know.

990
00:44:51,620 --> 00:44:52,620
 It's great.

991
00:44:52,620 --> 00:44:53,620
 What a life.

992
00:44:53,620 --> 00:44:54,620
 What a great life.

993
00:44:54,620 --> 00:44:56,300
 That is a good life.

994
00:44:56,300 --> 00:45:01,300
 I really thought Dan's John Lennon Christ God lightning thing was going to be the weirdest

995
00:45:01,300 --> 00:45:03,900
 thing we heard during this fact.

996
00:45:03,900 --> 00:45:07,840
 We're going to have to wrap up very soon, guys.

997
00:45:07,840 --> 00:45:10,400
 Can I give you a couple of old-fashioned words for children?

998
00:45:10,400 --> 00:45:11,400
 Sure.

999
00:45:11,400 --> 00:45:12,400
 Sure.

1000
00:45:12,400 --> 00:45:20,400
 There's a squeaker, which was defined as a bar boy, also a bastard or any other child.

1001
00:45:20,400 --> 00:45:24,000
 There's a tit, which was an old name for a Prim Young lass.

1002
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:25,000
 You tit.

1003
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:29,400
 I think that's not how you speak to a Prim Young lass.

1004
00:45:29,400 --> 00:45:31,400
 It is how I do.

1005
00:45:31,400 --> 00:45:38,260
 A bandling is just a child, a braggling is a 16th-century child, sucker is from 1384

1006
00:45:38,260 --> 00:45:44,460
 for a child who's still nursing, sucker, and chitty face is a little puny child.

1007
00:45:44,460 --> 00:45:47,220
 If you want to just keep that word and keep it going.

1008
00:45:47,220 --> 00:45:48,220
 Right.

1009
00:45:48,220 --> 00:45:51,460
 So there's handy for if your friends are new parents, you can throw those their way.

1010
00:45:51,460 --> 00:45:53,580
 Oh, what a lovely little chitty face.

1011
00:45:53,580 --> 00:45:58,620
 I found a thing which is a stubborn child law, and this was used in the General Court

1012
00:45:58,620 --> 00:46:01,500
 of Massachusetts in 1646.

1013
00:46:01,500 --> 00:46:06,880
 So this is the description of what you as a parent are allowed to do if you have a tantrum

1014
00:46:06,880 --> 00:46:07,880
 child.

1015
00:46:07,880 --> 00:46:12,220
 "Shall his father and mother, being his natural parents, lay hold of him and bring him to

1016
00:46:12,220 --> 00:46:17,480
 the magistrates assembled in court to testify on them that their son is stubborn and rebellious

1017
00:46:17,480 --> 00:46:23,120
 and will not obey their voice and lives with notorious crimes, and such a son shall be put

1018
00:46:23,120 --> 00:46:24,120
 to death."

1019
00:46:24,120 --> 00:46:25,120
 Not?

1020
00:46:25,120 --> 00:46:26,120
 Yeah.

1021
00:46:26,120 --> 00:46:29,840
 It's a real plot twist right at the end there.

1022
00:46:29,840 --> 00:46:34,740
 Is there no option of just having a word with them first?

1023
00:46:34,740 --> 00:46:35,740
 Wow.

1024
00:46:35,740 --> 00:46:36,740
 Yeah.

1025
00:46:36,740 --> 00:46:43,380
 Octopuses, throw tantrums, and at once, especially males when they don't get sex.

1026
00:46:43,380 --> 00:46:45,780
 Sorry, octopuses, you said.

1027
00:46:45,780 --> 00:46:46,780
 Octopuses.

1028
00:46:46,780 --> 00:46:49,120
 I must have misheard that as humans.

1029
00:46:49,120 --> 00:46:50,120
 Okay.

1030
00:46:50,120 --> 00:46:56,440
 All right, that is it, everyone.

1031
00:46:56,440 --> 00:46:57,780
 That is all of our facts.

1032
00:46:57,780 --> 00:46:59,280
 Thank you so much, Brisbane.

1033
00:46:59,280 --> 00:47:00,280
 That was awesome.

1034
00:47:00,280 --> 00:47:01,280
 It's amazing being here.

1035
00:47:01,280 --> 00:47:03,280
 We will be back again, and we'll be back again next week with another episode.

1036
00:47:03,280 --> 00:47:04,280
 We'll see you then.

1037
00:47:04,280 --> 00:47:04,780
 Goodbye!

1038
00:47:04,780 --> 00:47:14,780
 [applause]

1039
00:47:14,780 --> 00:47:17,360
 (upbeat music)
