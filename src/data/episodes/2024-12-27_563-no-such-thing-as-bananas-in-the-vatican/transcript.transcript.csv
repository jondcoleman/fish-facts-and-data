00:00:10,00:00:15,"Hello and welcome to another episode of No Such Thing as a Fish,"
00:00:15,00:00:19,a weekly podcast this week coming to you live from Brisbane.
00:00:19,00:00:24,>> [APPLAUSE]
00:00:24,00:00:26,>> My name is Dan Shriver.
00:00:26,00:00:31,"I'm sitting here with Anna Tushinsky, Andrew Hunter Murray, and James Harkin."
00:00:31,00:00:35,"And once again, we have gathered around the microphones with our four favorite"
00:00:35,00:00:40,"facts from the last seven days and in no particular order, here we go."
00:00:40,00:00:43,"Starting with fact number one, and that is my fact."
00:00:43,00:00:50,My fact this week is that Christmas is a very dangerous time for German penises.
00:00:50,00:00:52,>> [LAUGH]
00:00:52,00:00:56,>> This is a little study that was released last year where
00:00:56,00:01:00,German scientists were looking into the rate of hospital visits
00:01:00,00:01:04,"whereby someone has walked in and said, I think I've snapped my penis."
00:01:04,00:01:05,>> Snapped?
00:01:05,00:01:07,>> You hear a crack when it happens.
00:01:07,00:01:08,">> No, too much."
00:01:08,00:01:10,">> Well, that's what we're talking about unfortunately."
00:01:10,00:01:11,>> Merry Christmas.
00:01:11,00:01:14,>> Is this going to be our Christmas special?
00:01:14,00:01:17,">> Yeah, I think, yeah, a Christmas special and"
00:01:17,00:01:20,a sort of health and safety message.
00:01:20,00:01:20,>> Public service.
00:01:20,00:01:22,">> Yeah, so."
00:01:22,00:01:26,">> So actually, okay, to say that, that would happen if people are having sex, right?"
00:01:26,00:01:28,So are we saying that more people are having sex and
00:01:28,00:01:29,that's why they're injuring themselves?
00:01:29,00:01:30,">> Exactly, they're in party mode."
00:01:30,00:01:31,>> I see.
00:01:31,00:01:34,>> And so a lot more sex happens in that period.
00:01:34,00:01:38,"It says the injury tends to occur during wild sex,"
00:01:38,00:01:43,particularly in positions where you're not in direct eye contact.
00:01:43,00:01:47,>> [LAUGH]
00:01:47,00:01:48,">> I'll always maintain eye contact, though."
00:01:48,00:01:50,>> [LAUGH]
00:01:50,00:01:53,">> There's no such, I don't think there is such a position, is there?"
00:01:53,00:01:54,We're not in direct eye contact.
00:01:54,00:01:55,>> [LAUGH]
00:01:55,00:01:57,>> Not in my order.
00:01:57,00:02:01,>> [LAUGH]
00:02:01,00:02:03,">> And by the way, Australia, you think you're getting off lightly."
00:02:03,00:02:06,"It's also a dangerous time for Australian penises, so be careful."
00:02:06,00:02:10,"There was a Queensland doctor who said the cases had spiked by sort of 20,"
00:02:10,00:02:12,"I think, no, 50%, I think it was."
00:02:12,00:02:13,">> Wow, in that period?"
00:02:13,00:02:14,">> Yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:02:14,00:02:15,>> Wow.
00:02:15,00:02:18,>> It settles down about New Year's time in Germany for German penises.
00:02:18,00:02:22,There's less sex at the New Year period.
00:02:22,00:02:25,So it sort of calms down by the end of the year.
00:02:25,00:02:30,"But yeah, it's apparently when people go in with this injury,"
00:02:30,00:02:37,"it's quite a sight, the term color of an aubergine is often used."
00:02:37,00:02:39,>> My God.
00:02:39,00:02:39,>> Yeah.
00:02:39,00:02:41,>> I am never using that emoji ever again.
00:02:41,00:02:43,>> [LAUGH]
00:02:43,00:02:48,>> And it apparently remained consistent during the COVID-19 pandemic.
00:02:48,00:02:51,">> Right. >> Yeah, so that didn't dent it at all in that period."
00:02:51,00:02:53,">> No, it snapped it, I really forgot."
00:02:53,00:02:55,>> [LAUGH]
00:02:55,00:02:55,>> Yeah.
00:02:55,00:03:00,">> That's why, because that's not the most dangerous phenomenon for penises."
00:03:00,00:03:00,>> What do you mean?
00:03:00,00:03:01,>> Which I thought it might be.
00:03:01,00:03:05,"Well, the thing that causes most penis injuries, most penis hospital visits,"
00:03:05,00:03:06,probably guessable.
00:03:06,00:03:08,>> Vacuum cleaners.
00:03:08,00:03:08,>> Okay.
00:03:08,00:03:10,>> [LAUGH]
00:03:10,00:03:11,">> Yeah, yeah."
00:03:11,00:03:14,>> I knew I was gonna overshare as soon as I opened my mouth then.
00:03:14,00:03:16,">> Yeah, you should have waited a split second for"
00:03:16,00:03:19,that chap in the audience to interrupt you with the correct answer.
00:03:19,00:03:22,"Because I think you just said flies, and it is flies."
00:03:22,00:03:27,">> I thought you said wives, and I thought, [LAUGH]"
00:03:27,00:03:29,>> Girlfriends can do it too.
00:03:29,00:03:30,">> Flies, of course."
00:03:30,00:03:33,">> Zippers, yeah, people getting zipped up in them."
00:03:33,00:03:37,"Accounts for not 0.5% of ER visits altogether, which I think is quite high."
00:03:37,00:03:38,>> That is quite a lot.
00:03:38,00:03:42,">> One in 200, mostly children or younger teenagers."
00:03:42,00:03:45,"When you're not quite, you haven't learned yet that it's there."
00:03:45,00:03:46,>> [LAUGH]
00:03:46,00:03:47,>> It takes a few years.
00:03:47,00:03:49,">> Yes, yeah, yeah."
00:03:49,00:03:52,">> In 13th century England, Christmas was a very dangerous time for"
00:03:52,00:03:58,"testicles if you were a person who made money, if you were working in the mint."
00:03:58,00:04:03,Because the penalty for debasing coinage was cutting off the money as right hand
00:04:03,00:04:08,"and right testicle, and nailing it to the door of the smithy."
00:04:08,00:04:10,And then- >> Wait a second.
00:04:10,00:04:12,These coins are all made of chocolate.
00:04:12,00:04:14,>> [LAUGH]
00:04:14,00:04:18,">> Yeah, because in 1125, on Christmas Day, Henry I got all of the"
00:04:18,00:04:22,moneys to Winchester and had one of their balls chopped off.
00:04:22,00:04:23,>> On Christmas Day?
00:04:23,00:04:25,">> Christmas Day, wow."
00:04:25,00:04:28,">> Well, so he had one of each of their balls chopped off?"
00:04:28,00:04:30,Or just he picked one out of a hat.
00:04:30,00:04:34,">> No, no, it wasn't out of a hat, he got all the moneys in."
00:04:34,00:04:38,"I think about there were like four or five of them who got off, not in that way."
00:04:38,00:04:40,>> [LAUGH]
00:04:40,00:04:43,>> Can I ask you guys a quick question?
00:04:43,00:04:46,">> Yes, has anyone on this panel, and I'll put this out to the room as well,"
00:04:46,00:04:48,does anyone know anyone who's ever had a broken penis?
00:04:48,00:04:49,>> No.
00:04:49,00:04:50,>> No.
00:04:50,00:04:51,">> It's okay, a few people have."
00:04:51,00:04:53,">> What do you mean, like hospital level broken?"
00:04:53,00:04:55,>> Yeah. >> Or googling it in a panic level broken.
00:04:55,00:05:03,>> [LAUGH]
00:05:03,00:05:04,>> But I know both.
00:05:04,00:05:07,>> [LAUGH]
00:05:07,00:05:11,">> I know two people, so one was a kid on our school bus in Sydney."
00:05:11,00:05:15,"He was, I wasn't there on this day annoyingly, but they gave him a wedgie that"
00:05:15,00:05:20,"was so hard that, and so they lifted him to like the top bar."
00:05:20,00:05:23,"And then he went, a different sound came out of this,"
00:05:23,00:05:25,like a guttural animal sound came out.
00:05:25,00:05:28,"And he was missing for weeks, cuz his penis had snapped."
00:05:28,00:05:29,So that was one person.
00:05:29,00:05:32,"And then the second person, the three of you do know."
00:05:32,00:05:33,>> Great.
00:05:33,00:05:35,>> [LAUGH]
00:05:35,00:05:37,">> It's me, no, it's not me."
00:05:37,00:05:39,>> [LAUGH]
00:05:39,00:05:41,>> It's a guest who's been on our show.
00:05:41,00:05:44,Someone who broke their member on- >> Sandy Toxic.
00:05:44,00:05:47,>> [LAUGH]
00:05:47,00:05:49,>> Is it someone where this is public information or
00:05:49,00:05:53,are you the only person they told in secrecy and now it's going out to the world?
00:05:53,00:05:55,>> I think Stephen Fry said I could say this.
00:05:55,00:05:56,>> [LAUGH]
00:05:56,00:05:59,>> It was Johnny Knoxville of Jack Ass.
00:05:59,00:06:00,>> That makes a lot of sense.
00:06:00,00:06:03,">> Yeah, he puts himself at risk quite a lot, doesn't he?"
00:06:03,00:06:06,>> He went over on a motorbike and he landed and he broke it.
00:06:06,00:06:08,And he's always asked about it.
00:06:08,00:06:09,He says this has been well documented.
00:06:09,00:06:12,So much has been said about so little.
00:06:12,00:06:14,>> [LAUGH]
00:06:14,00:06:16,">> And they said that he might not,"
00:06:16,00:06:18,"it was gonna suffer from it, but he's had two kids since it happened."
00:06:18,00:06:20,"So, yeah, it's all fine."
00:06:20,00:06:21,>> Can I talk about Christmas?
00:06:21,00:06:22,">> Yes, please."
00:06:22,00:06:25,">> Yeah, let's get away from, please, please, please."
00:06:25,00:06:30,"Okay, do you want to hear an absolutely wild thing that happened in Christmas 1972?"
00:06:30,00:06:33,"Okay, it was sent in by a listener called Yara T, so thank you for this."
00:06:33,00:06:37,Marie Heffernan was a 13-year-old girl.
00:06:37,00:06:39,"She had a Christmas dinner with her family, right?"
00:06:39,00:06:42,"In Australia, at their home near Wollongong, and she-"
00:06:42,00:06:43,>> Wollongong?
00:06:43,00:06:44,>> Is that how it's pronounced?
00:06:44,00:06:45,>> [LAUGH]
00:06:45,00:06:46,>> Is it like that?
00:06:46,00:06:49,">> From the reaction, I'm not sure that's how you do pronounce it."
00:06:49,00:06:51,>> Wollongong.
00:06:51,00:06:52,">> You cannot, I am Australian, you cannot play."
00:06:52,00:06:53,>> What are you saying?
00:06:53,00:06:55,"Wollongong, Wollongong."
00:06:55,00:06:56,>> Why are you not looking at me?
00:06:56,00:06:57,>> That's what I said.
00:06:57,00:07:00,"I'm worried, you're gonna tell me about more penis stuff."
00:07:00,00:07:02,>> He just wants some eye contact.
00:07:02,00:07:03,>> All right.
00:07:03,00:07:08,>> [LAUGH]
00:07:08,00:07:11,>> At their home near Wollongong.
00:07:11,00:07:12,So she had this Christmas dinner.
00:07:12,00:07:16,"She got bad bronchitis and laryngitis after eating Christmas dinner, right?"
00:07:16,00:07:20,"It cleaned up, that sort of she got better, but her voice did not come back."
00:07:20,00:07:23,"And the doctors just said, well, you've lost your voice due to a virus."
00:07:23,00:07:27,"It could come back any time, but it's, you know, you have to just wait."
00:07:27,00:07:32,She waited for 12 years with no voice.
00:07:32,00:07:37,"And then, suddenly, at the age of 25, she started to choke."
00:07:37,00:07:38,"And this, she had a little coughing fit, and"
00:07:38,00:07:42,it brought up this little sort of lump from her throat.
00:07:42,00:07:45,"She took the lump to the Royal Canberra Hospital, where a doctor found it was not"
00:07:45,00:07:52,"human tissue, but a 1959 three penny coin that she had swallowed from the Christmas"
00:07:52,00:07:53,"pudding, or rather she hadn't swallowed it."
00:07:53,00:07:58,"It got stuck between her vocal cords, so it was thin and in a horizontal position."
00:07:58,00:08:01,So the x-ray didn't see it when she was x-rayed.
00:08:01,00:08:06,"So she had no voice for 12 years, because it had just stayed exactly in position"
00:08:06,00:08:07,and stopped her vocal cords vibrating.
00:08:07,00:08:11,"And then when they got it out, she went, I think there's a coin in my throat!"
00:08:11,00:08:17,[LAUGHTER]
00:08:17,00:08:18,Isn't that...
00:08:18,00:08:19,That is mental.
00:08:19,00:08:24,"That's a little weird version of the Little Mermaid, isn't it?"
00:08:24,00:08:29,"Yes, it's less contunes in that one, but yeah."
00:08:29,00:08:30,"Yeah, anyway."
00:08:30,00:08:34,"So the penis injuries aren't the most common injuries at Christmas, but there are quite"
00:08:34,00:08:38,"a lot of very Christmas-specific injuries, and I find it really interesting, because"
00:08:38,00:08:40,"they're all catalogued, and these stories come out at Christmas about what's the most"
00:08:40,00:08:44,"likely way you'll get injured, and the way they collect the data is from hospital visits."
00:08:44,00:08:47,"And they're all things where you think, why have you gone to hospital?"
00:08:47,00:08:51,So loads of people pull muscles getting turkey out of the oven.
00:08:51,00:08:58,"Now, what kind of diligent Christmas housewife is getting a turkey out of the oven, spraining"
00:08:58,00:09:01,"a little bit of an arm, and demanding she goes to hospital, rather than serving up bloody"
00:09:01,00:09:03,lunch like she should be?
00:09:03,00:09:09,"Honestly, I just like to disassociate myself with that comment."
00:09:09,00:09:13,Welcome to Back to the 1950s.
00:09:13,00:09:14,Christmas in the 50s.
00:09:14,00:09:20,"No, there's some other weird ones, like a woman who slipped while stapling a Christmas light,"
00:09:20,00:09:21,stapled her left hand.
00:09:21,00:09:23,I've put a stapler in my hand.
00:09:23,00:09:24,They're very small.
00:09:24,00:09:25,Don't go to hospital.
00:09:25,00:09:27,Isn't this fair advice?
00:09:27,00:09:31,"You are such a loss to the NHS, and I love you."
00:09:31,00:09:32,Get out.
00:09:32,00:09:33,Get out.
00:09:33,00:09:34,Get out.
00:09:34,00:09:35,Get out.
00:09:35,00:09:36,No.
00:09:36,00:09:37,No.
00:09:37,00:09:38,Just Google it.
00:09:38,00:09:39,No.
00:09:39,00:09:40,Google in a panic.
00:09:40,00:09:42,"There was one where I thought, that's justified."
00:09:42,00:09:46,"This was on Christmas Day, a moment where a mum noticed her five-year-old was picking"
00:09:46,00:09:50,"their nose, and when they got up closer to the five-year-old, they found that a foul odour"
00:09:50,00:09:54,"was coming out of their nose, and it was discovered the child had put a Christmas decoration in"
00:09:54,00:09:55,their left nostril.
00:09:55,00:10:00,But what Christmas decoration emits a foul odour?
00:10:00,00:10:03,"Maybe it had been there a while, or..."
00:10:03,00:10:04,"So, only Christmas Day?"
00:10:04,00:10:05,"No, you're right."
00:10:05,00:10:06,You're right.
00:10:06,00:10:09,"Well, there are always dogs that swallow tinsel, and then you have to pick a deer."
00:10:09,00:10:11,"Don't go to any for them, either."
00:10:11,00:10:12,No.
00:10:12,00:10:14,"But you have to remove it from the other end, often, don't you?"
00:10:14,00:10:15,You do.
00:10:15,00:10:17,"It's called a linear foreign body, if you're a vet."
00:10:17,00:10:18,Do you?
00:10:18,00:10:19,Yeah.
00:10:19,00:10:22,"Is there any point where it's still coming through the mouth, and you're removing it"
00:10:22,00:10:23,from the other side?
00:10:23,00:10:27,"I don't believe that sort of permanent dog floss has been invented, though."
00:10:27,00:10:28,Interesting.
00:10:28,00:10:29,Yeah.
00:10:29,00:10:30,Sorry.
00:10:30,00:10:35,"Yeah, America has a similar database where they log down all the Christmas injuries."
00:10:35,00:10:36,Do you know what it is?
00:10:36,00:10:37,Are you talking about NICE?
00:10:37,00:10:38,Yeah.
00:10:38,00:10:39,"So, NICE, NEISS."
00:10:39,00:10:44,"Sorry to jump across again, but National Electronic Injury Surveillance System, it records all"
00:10:44,00:10:45,the data.
00:10:45,00:10:48,"And NICE is an anagram of NISA, which is the Danish for ELF."
00:10:48,00:10:49,"Oh, my God."
00:10:49,00:10:50,Yeah.
00:10:50,00:10:51,Wow.
00:10:51,00:10:52,What's going on there?
00:10:52,00:10:53,"What's going on, Andy?"
00:10:53,00:10:54,Yeah.
00:10:54,00:10:55,And NICE is also naughty or NICE.
00:10:55,00:10:56,Yeah.
00:10:56,00:10:57,What's going on?
00:10:57,00:10:58,What are they hiding?
00:10:58,00:11:02,"Well, I think we'll all agree that was worth the interruption."
00:11:02,00:11:08,"But so, yeah, they published a report in 2009."
00:11:08,00:11:11,Do you want to go to the hospital for that first?
00:11:11,00:11:14,I feel like I do.
00:11:14,00:11:20,"2014, 809 people were admitted into ER in the States for Christmas-based injuries."
00:11:20,00:11:24,"There's a lot of normal ones, almost similar to the ones that you were talking about, Anna,"
00:11:24,00:11:26,about pieces getting stuck and so on.
00:11:26,00:11:27,This one's interesting.
00:11:27,00:11:33,"This was a 21-year-old man who, according to the database, was riding on a TV when he"
00:11:33,00:11:39,ran into a turkey and lost control and then ran into a tree.
00:11:39,00:11:41,No more information supplied.
00:11:41,00:11:46,Another big Christmas setback or mess up that you can have is food poisoning.
00:11:46,00:11:47,"Oh, yeah."
00:11:47,00:11:50,"Because if you don't cook a turkey enough or anything, I guess."
00:11:50,00:11:55,"So in 2013, there was a group of Norwegian seafood researchers from Norway's National"
00:11:55,00:11:58,"Institute of Nutrition and Seafood Research, and they thought, ""Let's have a Christmas"
00:11:58,00:11:59,party.
00:11:59,00:12:04,"Why don't we use some lovely local cockles, and we'll serve them raw, but we'll pour boiling"
00:12:04,00:12:05,"soup all over them."""
00:12:05,00:12:07,So that will theoretically be absolutely fine.
00:12:07,00:12:08,Okay.
00:12:08,00:12:10,All of them got horrific food poisoning.
00:12:10,00:12:13,"And then, because they were the investigators, they had to investigate their own Christmas"
00:12:13,00:12:16,party to see what had caused it.
00:12:16,00:12:19,"The problem was that the soup was gaspacho, wasn't it?"
00:12:19,00:12:26,"Yeah, that's right."
00:12:26,00:12:30,"It is time for fact number two, and that is Anna."
00:12:30,00:12:36,My fact this week is that the value of goods Americans refund each year is more than the
00:12:36,00:12:40,GDP of 90% of the world's countries.
00:12:40,00:12:41,What?
00:12:41,00:12:42,What?
00:12:42,00:12:43,What?
00:12:43,00:12:44,It is a big problem.
00:12:44,00:12:49,"By some estimates, it takes you to an amount that is more than all but the richest 19 countries"
00:12:49,00:12:50,in the world's GDP.
00:12:50,00:12:56,So Switzerland is about where you get to at which point Switzerland is financially a smaller
00:12:56,00:13:00,country than the returned goods of the United States of America.
00:13:00,00:13:03,"It's also more than America spends on roads, railways, and airports put together."
00:13:03,00:13:08,"I don't know what's like here in Oz at the moment, but back in the UK, I feel like there"
00:13:08,00:13:13,"needs to be a lane specifically now for people returning items, because that's what you're"
00:13:13,00:13:16,stuck behind when you're trying to buy something in a physical shop.
00:13:16,00:13:20,"What it is is people are buying clothes, going out and partying one night, and then returning"
00:13:20,00:13:21,it the next day.
00:13:21,00:13:26,"They found that all these people who are returning stuff, there's just obvious patterns."
00:13:26,00:13:30,"People who buy portable generators during weather emergencies, they'll use them right"
00:13:30,00:13:34,"until the emergency is ended, and then all of those go back, just as huge amount goes"
00:13:34,00:13:35,back.
00:13:35,00:13:41,There's a big culture of lots and lots of refunds as well.
00:13:41,00:13:45,"You're entitled to a refund for lots of stuff, so in the USA, Petco will take back fish that"
00:13:45,00:13:47,have died.
00:13:47,00:13:49,You can get a refund if your fish has died.
00:13:49,00:13:51,Like the Monty Python sketch.
00:13:51,00:13:53,"Pretty much, except they just don't quibble."
00:13:53,00:14:00,And Home Depot lets you return dead plants for a year.
00:14:00,00:14:03,"All you have to do is be shameless enough to wrap up your dead plant and send it back,"
00:14:03,00:14:05,and they will probably give you the refund.
00:14:05,00:14:09,"The key thing to know there is they're not selling these things on, and this is why it's"
00:14:09,00:14:10,a problem.
00:14:10,00:14:14,They don't flog a dead plant to some chump and convince them it's a rare species.
00:14:14,00:14:17,Because I think that's what happens when people send back their cloves or something.
00:14:17,00:14:21,"They think, ""Oh, they'll just put it back on the rack and whatever."""
00:14:21,00:14:26,"They never do that, and most people will order three sizes of the same thing and then keep"
00:14:26,00:14:28,the one that fits and send the two others back.
00:14:28,00:14:29,Most people.
00:14:29,00:14:31,"I mean, most people don't do that."
00:14:31,00:14:32,Don't worry.
00:14:32,00:14:33,Sorry.
00:14:33,00:14:35,Most people who have done the refunds.
00:14:35,00:14:36,My wife.
00:14:36,00:14:37,My wife.
00:14:37,00:14:38,That's what I'm trying to say.
00:14:38,00:14:43,"So they'll send back the two that didn't fit, and then probably everyone assume, ""Okay."
00:14:43,00:14:45,"That just goes back on to ..."" And it doesn't."
00:14:45,00:14:47,"But when you think about it, it's an insane assumption to make."
00:14:47,00:14:50,"Because I assume that if I send back this pair of socks, then it'll be returned and"
00:14:50,00:14:54,it'll be somehow got back into the stream of new socks that are coming out of the sock
00:14:54,00:14:55,factory.
00:14:55,00:14:58,And it's actually very difficult to get a pair of socks into the new supply line of
00:14:58,00:14:59,socks.
00:14:59,00:15:00,And it's not worth it.
00:15:00,00:15:03,And you've got to get that weird plastic thing with the two little toggles on the end
00:15:03,00:15:04,through it again.
00:15:04,00:15:07,"Well, I always include that in a separate envelope when I send it back, but still, I think it"
00:15:07,00:15:08,doesn't do any good.
00:15:08,00:15:13,"Are you only, like, by the pair of socks just to wear them once for sex, presumably, and"
00:15:13,00:15:14,then send them back?
00:15:14,00:15:17,"Yeah, but it's a once-yearly thing, so it doesn't matter."
00:15:17,00:15:20,It's a relatively low-impact thing.
00:15:20,00:15:24,But there was an amazing thing in the Atlantic about this whole system.
00:15:24,00:15:28,"So when you return an item, what we see as customers is you see the label you print out,"
00:15:28,00:15:32,you might hand it to a local shopkeeper and they post it off for you and you get the refund.
00:15:32,00:15:38,"But beyond that, there's this mad system that kicks in of liquidators and recyclers and"
00:15:38,00:15:39,resellers.
00:15:39,00:15:42,"And they are shuffling it and, you know, sometimes they're reselling it."
00:15:42,00:15:46,"And this is what the Atlantic says, ""Deep within that system, in a processing facility"
00:15:46,00:15:51,"in the Lehigh Valley, a guy named Michael has to sniff your sweatpants."""
00:15:51,00:15:54,"Because they have these material, what they call material handlers who have to work out"
00:15:54,00:15:55,what to do with it.
00:15:55,00:15:56,"""Is this good to be sold on?"
00:15:56,00:15:57,"Is it fine?"""
00:15:57,00:16:00,"And so they'll look, they'll feel, they'll assess, and they'll take a big old sniff."
00:16:00,00:16:02,"And they make them change their names, don't they, as part of the job."
00:16:02,00:16:03,It's all Michael.
00:16:03,00:16:05,"It's Michael one, Michael two, Michael three."
00:16:05,00:16:06,Yeah.
00:16:06,00:16:10,"And we should say, this is pretty much all online, is online, which has created this"
00:16:10,00:16:11,enormous industry.
00:16:11,00:16:17,"But like you said, it has, it was begun, the habit of letting people refund their clothes,"
00:16:17,00:16:21,"no questions asked, in the early 20th century."
00:16:21,00:16:27,"And in fact, I think it was JC Penny stores, which are those big American department stores,"
00:16:27,00:16:32,that was their innovation quite early on to basically say customers can bring anything
00:16:32,00:16:33,back.
00:16:33,00:16:38,"Just to the extent that people would bring stuff in that was clearly from another shop,"
00:16:38,00:16:40,and then they'd refund it there.
00:16:40,00:16:43,"And I think Walmart said the same thing, Walmart took tips from them, we're like, ""Yep, we'll"
00:16:43,00:16:44,"take it back."""
00:16:44,00:16:47,"They bring a pony back that they've got from the local state, just take it, give them a"
00:16:47,00:16:49,"refund, give them 10 grand, let them go on their merry way."
00:16:49,00:16:50,"The customers always, right?"
00:16:50,00:16:53,"And I think the guy who founded Walmart worked at JC Penny, didn't he?"
00:16:53,00:16:54,"I think he did, yeah."
00:16:54,00:16:59,"And JC Penny, billionaire, who created an industry, do you know what the C in JC Penny"
00:16:59,00:17:00,stood for?
00:17:00,00:17:01,Christmas.
00:17:01,00:17:02,"Oh, no."
00:17:02,00:17:03,Cash.
00:17:03,00:17:04,Cash.
00:17:04,00:17:05,Cash Penny.
00:17:05,00:17:06,Cash Penny.
00:17:06,00:17:07,It's Cash Penny.
00:17:07,00:17:08,No.
00:17:08,00:17:11,"Like the rich English family called Money Coots, which is Coots is the bank, it's, yeah, Cash"
00:17:11,00:17:12,Penny.
00:17:12,00:17:15,"I wish I could tell you what the J was, and I forgot to Google it."
00:17:15,00:17:16,It's James.
00:17:16,00:17:17,James Cash Penny.
00:17:17,00:17:18,Yeah.
00:17:18,00:17:21,All very rich words.
00:17:21,00:17:29,Do you know the practice of buying an item once and then returning it for refund deliberately?
00:17:29,00:17:33,"You buy it for a party, you wear it, you send it back pretending it didn't fit."
00:17:33,00:17:37,"It's called Wardrobe-ing, and all the companies refer to this."
00:17:37,00:17:40,"If you read it on their websites, they'll be chatting to each other on the forums."
00:17:40,00:17:42,"Oh, Wardrobe-ing is such an issue in our industry."
00:17:42,00:17:44,So stop Wardrobe-ing.
00:17:44,00:17:48,"It's so funny watching, because I'm in the queues, as I say, there needs to be a separate"
00:17:48,00:17:49,line.
00:17:49,00:17:50,I'm behind the...
00:17:50,00:17:51,Behind your wife?
00:17:51,00:17:52,I'm behind my wife.
00:17:52,00:17:57,"No, you're behind these extraordinarily hungover people who clearly have been partying all"
00:17:57,00:18:00,"night, and they're like, ""It didn't fit."
00:18:00,00:18:01,"I need to return it."""
00:18:01,00:18:06,"You're like, ""Dude, you literally are still drunk, and you're handing this back."
00:18:06,00:18:07,"Yeah, it's wild."""
00:18:07,00:18:08,It does happen.
00:18:08,00:18:09,"They're not just with clothes, of course."
00:18:09,00:18:11,You get refunds with all sorts of things these days.
00:18:11,00:18:16,"On delivery services, like food delivery services, you can sometimes get a refund if there's"
00:18:16,00:18:21,"a problem with your meal, and these days, they're getting to a stage where they'll just often"
00:18:21,00:18:24,give you the refund without that much evidence.
00:18:24,00:18:29,So there was a guy who got refunded his just eat order because he complained his ice cream
00:18:29,00:18:30,was cold.
00:18:30,00:18:35,"It's like, ""I'm going to want a refund."""
00:18:35,00:18:37,"It puts in, ""What's your reason?"""
00:18:37,00:18:40,"He just made it up, made up a reason, and they just gave him the refund."
00:18:40,00:18:43,And then the retailer's the one who loses out.
00:18:43,00:18:47,Sometimes it does hurt your teeth.
00:18:47,00:18:48,Yeah.
00:18:48,00:18:49,It's too much.
00:18:49,00:18:53,"There was also an exchange on Twitter that I saw where there was a customer who said,"
00:18:53,00:19:00,"""Hello, I ordered a dozen custom masks from you, however you only sent me 12."""
00:19:00,00:19:04,"It was a baker, though, wasn't it?"
00:19:04,00:19:08,"There was, I read a lady who tried to get a refund off a holiday that she went on to"
00:19:08,00:19:09,Spain.
00:19:09,00:19:11,"She went to this hotel, and afterwards she wrote a complaint saying, ""I want my money"
00:19:11,00:19:12,"back."""
00:19:12,00:19:13,"And they said, ""Why?"""
00:19:13,00:19:17,"And she said, ""There were too many Spanish people in the hotel."""
00:19:17,00:19:20,"And she was like, ""Shouldn't they be on holiday somewhere else?"
00:19:20,00:19:23,"What are they doing in my Spanish holiday?"""
00:19:23,00:19:25,"And they refused, obviously."
00:19:25,00:19:29,"So we assume she's very xenophobic, but it could be she's just objected to the logic"
00:19:29,00:19:32,"of the fact that if you're going on holiday, surely it's not your own country."
00:19:32,00:19:38,I was looking at just sort of general returning gifts or refusing gifts as a way of looking
00:19:38,00:19:39,at this one.
00:19:39,00:19:44,"So President Abraham Lincoln, he was offered some gifts in 1861 by the king of Siam who"
00:19:44,00:19:47,"said, ""I would like to send you some elephants."
00:19:47,00:19:49,All you have to do is release them.
00:19:49,00:19:51,They will multiply across America.
00:19:51,00:19:55,"If you give us a big ship and fill it with hay and water, we'll send loads of elephants"
00:19:55,00:19:56,across to you.
00:19:56,00:19:58,"And just let them loose and you'll have loads of, you know, within a century America will"
00:19:58,00:20:02,"be overrun with elephants and that'll be a really good thing for transportation purposes."""
00:20:02,00:20:03,Right.
00:20:03,00:20:06,"Well, there are elephants in America now, so did he just say no or...?"
00:20:06,00:20:12,"He wrote back with the most diplomatic answer, like it sets a good standard for American presidents"
00:20:12,00:20:13,in terms of diplomacy.
00:20:13,00:20:17,"He wrote back saying, ""Certainly America does not reach a latitude so low as to favour"
00:20:17,00:20:19,"the multiplication of the elephants."""
00:20:19,00:20:20,Really?
00:20:20,00:20:21,But thank you so much anyway.
00:20:21,00:20:24,It was just a very subtle nice way.
00:20:24,00:20:27,Everyone always sent a letter in advance warning you what the present was they were going
00:20:27,00:20:28,to get you.
00:20:28,00:20:29,So you can send them for light rejection.
00:20:29,00:20:34,There was a guy in India who wanted a refund for a train ticket.
00:20:34,00:20:41,"He'd been overcharged for a train ticket by 20 rupees, which was 25 cents, US cents."
00:20:41,00:20:46,"And after 100 hearings, eventually he got his 20 rupees back."
00:20:46,00:20:50,Apparently his family tried to convince him that it was all pointless and a waste of time
00:20:50,00:20:54,"and money, but he says it's not the money that matters."
00:20:54,00:20:57,This is a fight for justice and a fight against corruption.
00:20:57,00:21:03,That's the shittest Batman ever.
00:21:03,00:21:09,"In fairness, the rail company was fined about US$200, which he got as well, so he got some"
00:21:09,00:21:10,money out of it.
00:21:10,00:21:13,But that still didn't play for the massive divorce proceedings that followed.
00:21:13,00:21:18,22 years of trying to get his 20 rupees back.
00:21:18,00:21:21,Customers complaining goes back a long way.
00:21:21,00:21:22,It's so exciting.
00:21:22,00:21:25,"This is something that I think we've probably been aware of, but we've never mentioned on"
00:21:25,00:21:33,the podcast that there's a demand for a refund that is on a clay tablet from 1750 BC.
00:21:33,00:21:34,It's one of the oldest ones we have.
00:21:34,00:21:42,"It's a Mesopotamia, and it's so good because it's exactly like a TripAdvisor complaint today."
00:21:42,00:21:47,"And it's a complaint to someone called Aya Naseer from a customer who's called Nani,"
00:21:47,00:21:52,and Nani has sent his servant to buy some copper ingots on his behalf.
00:21:52,00:21:56,"And he considered the ingots substandard, and the complaint is just an explanation of"
00:21:56,00:21:58,how these ingots are very poor standard of ingots.
00:21:58,00:22:03,"But not only that, the servant was treated very poorly by the salesperson when he tried"
00:22:03,00:22:04,to buy them.
00:22:04,00:22:08,"He'd been dreadfully rude to them, so apparently the salesperson has said, ""Well, if you want"
00:22:08,00:22:09,"to take them, take them."
00:22:09,00:22:11,"If you don't want to take them, don't."""
00:22:11,00:22:12,And it was great.
00:22:12,00:22:14,"And then saying, ""You know, you must restore my money to me in full."
00:22:14,00:22:15,"This isn't good enough."""
00:22:15,00:22:17,"And that's 4,000 years ago."
00:22:17,00:22:27,"4,000 years we've been whinging."
00:22:27,00:22:32,"It is time for us to move on to fact number three, and that is Andy."
00:22:32,00:22:39,My fact is there is a man in America who has tasted 500 kinds of banana and claims he has
00:22:39,00:22:41,special banana eyes.
00:22:41,00:22:43,He's called Gabriel Sachter-Smith.
00:22:43,00:22:47,"He lives in Hawaii, and he was recently profiled in the New York Times, which is how I found"
00:22:47,00:22:48,out about him.
00:22:48,00:22:49,He is a banana fan.
00:22:49,00:22:50,He's a banana farmer.
00:22:50,00:22:51,He's a big banana boy.
00:22:51,00:22:55,"He just loves bananas, basically, and he hunts bananas around the world."
00:22:55,00:22:56,He hunts the rare bananas.
00:22:56,00:22:57,"They're easy to catch, aren't they?"
00:22:57,00:22:58,They're slow-moving.
00:22:58,00:23:01,But you've got to know what you're looking for.
00:23:01,00:23:05,"You've got a spot and say, ""I've never seen you before."""
00:23:05,00:23:09,And so he grows 150 different varieties on his own.
00:23:09,00:23:10,He hunts new varieties.
00:23:10,00:23:12,"I see you, like, special, weird-looking."
00:23:12,00:23:16,"Like, rare ones that, you know, we've got one biggie, the Cavendish, that's the global"
00:23:16,00:23:17,banana these days.
00:23:17,00:23:19,"He's looking for the rare, the deep cuts."
00:23:19,00:23:22,And a lot of them don't look like a banana.
00:23:22,00:23:23,So some of them are egg-shaped.
00:23:23,00:23:27,"Some of them are like, it's kind of like with potatoes as well."
00:23:27,00:23:31,"Like, there are potato hunters that go out there, and they go, ""This is a potato."
00:23:31,00:23:33,"It looks nothing like a potato."""
00:23:33,00:23:34,It doesn't look nothing.
00:23:34,00:23:36,"It doesn't look like a dinosaur, does it?"
00:23:36,00:23:40,"Yeah, no, but it does look like a tree, for example, like it just doesn't look like what"
00:23:40,00:23:41,it is.
00:23:41,00:23:42,And it's the same with this.
00:23:42,00:23:44,So apparently this is what his brilliant skill is.
00:23:44,00:23:49,"Wherever he is, he can just say, ""Banana,"" and people go, ""That's a postbox."""
00:23:49,00:23:50,"And they'll say, ""No."""
00:23:50,00:23:52,"I'll tell you, that's my wife."
00:23:52,00:23:53,It's a banana.
00:23:53,00:23:57,"That's what his banana eyes are, that eyes that can spot a new variety of banana."
00:23:57,00:23:58,Yeah.
00:23:58,00:24:02,"He tracks them down, and he has people guiding him as well who might know special local cultivars"
00:24:02,00:24:03,of banana.
00:24:03,00:24:10,"So he's one of the world experts on it, and it's really useful because scientists have"
00:24:10,00:24:16,"a secret supply of support bananas, just in case something happens to the Cavendish,"
00:24:16,00:24:17,which is our big variety.
00:24:17,00:24:18,A support?
00:24:18,00:24:23,Is that like a banana you bring on an aeroplane if you're slightly emotionally vulnerable?
00:24:23,00:24:28,"He's sent 200 new bananas to a gene bank in Belgium, and they're cryo-preserved at minus"
00:24:28,00:24:29,200 degrees.
00:24:29,00:24:33,"They're like Hans Solo, just waiting to be thawed out in case of diet emergency."
00:24:33,00:24:35,"But they're all like the Cavendish are just really tasty, right?"
00:24:35,00:24:38,"And the other ones are just all rubbish, like little brown things."
00:24:38,00:24:42,"Cavendish would be bred to be very tasty, haven't they?"
00:24:42,00:24:47,"But they might be vulnerable to disease, although scientists are always working on reinforcing"
00:24:47,00:24:49,the Cavendish to make sure that that can last as the banana.
00:24:49,00:24:53,"So there's no imminent peril, I think."
00:24:53,00:24:58,"I think I read there's 1,600 different varieties of banana in this vault that are like Austin"
00:24:58,00:24:59,Powers.
00:24:59,00:25:04,"They're sitting there waiting to wake up in a future that they won't understand, and"
00:25:04,00:25:07,"we'll say ""cancelable things""."
00:25:07,00:25:11,"But it is amazing, like the science that is going on."
00:25:11,00:25:13,You think bananas are just in the wild?
00:25:13,00:25:17,"No, we've got people protecting the banana at a huge scientific base."
00:25:17,00:25:21,"Yeah, a lot is going into it, because it is a risk just because Cavendish are clones,"
00:25:21,00:25:25,"so they may not have anything threatening them now, but as soon as the threat comes,"
00:25:25,00:25:26,they're all done.
00:25:26,00:25:29,"And yeah, I love banana heroes who are really into it."
00:25:29,00:25:33,Do you know who eats the most bananas in the world?
00:25:33,00:25:36,"What nationality-wise, or individual-wise?"
00:25:36,00:25:38,"Yeah, the answer is monkeys."
00:25:38,00:25:40,"No, which country?"
00:25:40,00:25:41,Which country?
00:25:41,00:25:45,"I mean, I'll be honest, you're not going to guess this in a million years."
00:25:45,00:25:46,Really?
00:25:46,00:25:47,Equatorial Guinea.
00:25:47,00:25:48,Is it per capita?
00:25:48,00:25:49,"Oh, wouldn't it have been good?"
00:25:49,00:25:50,That would have been amazing.
00:25:50,00:25:51,"It was worth a try, wasn't it?"
00:25:51,00:25:52,I wouldn't say it was confidence.
00:25:52,00:25:53,"This is per capita, yeah."
00:25:53,00:25:54,Australia?
00:25:54,00:26:01,"Australia eats around one a week, one every five days, an average Australian would eat."
00:26:01,00:26:02,Okay.
00:26:02,00:26:05,"Okay, and this is, can you tell us how much these people eat before we find out who they"
00:26:05,00:26:06,are?
00:26:06,00:26:07,"Yeah, ten a day."
00:26:07,00:26:08,Get out.
00:26:08,00:26:09,Eat?
00:26:09,00:26:10,It's just not true.
00:26:10,00:26:11,It's so true.
00:26:11,00:26:12,"People, oh, the Vatican."
00:26:12,00:26:13,The Vatican is a huge...
00:26:13,00:26:14,The Pope.
00:26:14,00:26:21,"There's no end to that, just they love, they need the energy for the services, and you know..."
00:26:21,00:26:23,What is the Pope doing with those bananas?
00:26:23,00:26:24,Yeah.
00:26:24,00:26:28,"Well, it's a normal sized country, but you're not going to guess it, but you weren't a"
00:26:28,00:26:30,million miles away with Equatorial Guinea.
00:26:30,00:26:31,It's Uganda.
00:26:31,00:26:32,"Uganda, yeah."
00:26:32,00:26:39,"Uganda eats 660 pounds of bananas each year, which is about 3,000 per year on average per"
00:26:39,00:26:40,person.
00:26:40,00:26:43,But the reason is because Ugandan food is basically banana-based.
00:26:43,00:26:47,"So you have banana bread, you have banana..."
00:26:47,00:26:51,"The most common banana dish, matoke, is also the word for food in Uganda."
00:26:51,00:26:52,Oh.
00:26:52,00:26:53,You have Uganda beer.
00:26:53,00:26:54,You have...
00:26:54,00:26:55,You have...
00:26:55,00:26:56,Banana beer.
00:26:56,00:26:57,Banana beer.
00:26:57,00:26:58,I think I've had one too.
00:26:58,00:26:59,"Many banana beers, maybe."
00:26:59,00:27:01,"It's almost a problem, isn't it?"
00:27:01,00:27:04,It makes up about 35% of the Ugandan diet.
00:27:04,00:27:11,"I think Uganda and Congo are the top two of these matukae bananas, which are cooking bananas."
00:27:11,00:27:16,"So more like plantain, I guess, but it's a bit of an issue."
00:27:16,00:27:17,People get deficiencies.
00:27:17,00:27:20,"So there's a lot of vitamin A deficiency problems, because so much of their diet is"
00:27:20,00:27:22,based on bananas that doesn't have enough.
00:27:22,00:27:27,"So they've now made a super banana specifically for Uganda, which is a banana that has 30"
00:27:27,00:27:33,"times as much vitamin A as the normal banana, and could solve a lot of their problems, which"
00:27:33,00:27:34,is very cool.
00:27:34,00:27:35,But people don't want to eat it.
00:27:35,00:27:37,"There's suspicion, because it's a little bit orange."
00:27:37,00:27:42,"So sellers are saying people are coming to us saying, ""We just want the natural banana."
00:27:42,00:27:43,This banana's gone orange.
00:27:43,00:27:44,"What's wrong with it?"""
00:27:44,00:27:45,Yeah.
00:27:45,00:27:46,"Well, it feels like you could just paint it."
00:27:46,00:27:49,I think that might take away some of the nutritional value.
00:27:49,00:27:50,"Well, it doesn't."
00:27:50,00:27:51,It's on the skin.
00:27:51,00:27:52,You take it off.
00:27:52,00:27:53,You take the skin off.
00:27:53,00:27:54,"No, no."
00:27:54,00:27:55,Sorry.
00:27:55,00:27:56,It's the flesh.
00:27:56,00:27:57,The flesh is orange.
00:27:57,00:27:58,"Yeah, sorry."
00:27:58,00:27:59,Do you want to hear about the Highland Giant Banana?
00:27:59,00:28:00,"Yes, please."
00:28:00,00:28:02,Is it a real or is it like a cryptid?
00:28:02,00:28:03,It's real.
00:28:03,00:28:04,Oh.
00:28:04,00:28:05,It's the biggest banana on the planet.
00:28:05,00:28:07,"I wish it was a cryptid, though, because I'd love that."
00:28:07,00:28:08,I believe in that monster.
00:28:08,00:28:09,"Well, you decide."
00:28:09,00:28:12,"I'll tell you about it, and you decide if it's real or not."
00:28:12,00:28:15,"So it's called Musa Ingans, is the scientific name."
00:28:15,00:28:20,"It's the biggest non-woody plant on the planet, because it's not woody bananas or herbs, they're"
00:28:20,00:28:21,not trees.
00:28:21,00:28:22,Yeah.
00:28:22,00:28:28,"But it's 45 feet tall, and because it's not wood, it gets knocked over by the wind very"
00:28:28,00:28:29,easily.
00:28:29,00:28:32,So it only grows in very deep jungle canyons in Papua New Guinea.
00:28:32,00:28:33,Cool.
00:28:33,00:28:34,Yeah.
00:28:34,00:28:35,And the fruit are very big.
00:28:35,00:28:36,Wow.
00:28:36,00:28:40,I bet the Pope fucking loves them.
00:28:40,00:28:45,I didn't write down a measurement for the fruit.
00:28:45,00:28:46,What was I thinking?
00:28:46,00:28:49,"I just thought I'd cover it at the end by saying, ""And they're very big."""
00:28:49,00:28:52,"I've seen photos of them, and they are massive."
00:28:52,00:28:54,"Because we've all seen big trees, Andy."
00:28:54,00:28:55,It's a big banana.
00:28:55,00:28:56,They're little people.
00:28:56,00:28:57,"No, this big."
00:28:57,00:28:58,Whoa.
00:28:58,00:29:02,"He's gone for almost the length of a human arm, I would say, the teenager's arm."
00:29:02,00:29:04,"Size of a chihuahua, I would say."
00:29:04,00:29:07,"Size of a very, like, overfed chihuahua, I tell you."
00:29:07,00:29:08,Yeah.
00:29:08,00:29:09,Yeah.
00:29:09,00:29:10,Because they're fat.
00:29:10,00:29:13,"Hey, one interesting thing about the fact that bananas are herbs, right, is they don't"
00:29:13,00:29:15,have a trunk like a normal tree would do.
00:29:15,00:29:18,"They have, they're not a woody stem."
00:29:18,00:29:22,"And so when you see a banana tree, you'll see, like, at the top, the leaves are all"
00:29:22,00:29:25,"kind of shredded, like it's been in a hurricane."
00:29:25,00:29:28,But that's to help it if it's ever in a hurricane.
00:29:28,00:29:33,"Because when the wind blows it, because they don't have the wooden stems, the kind of,"
00:29:33,00:29:35,they might blow over quite easily.
00:29:35,00:29:39,"And because they've got these kind of tattered leaves, it means that the wind can get right"
00:29:39,00:29:40,through them.
00:29:40,00:29:41,That's pretty clever.
00:29:41,00:29:42,"That's cool, isn't it?"
00:29:42,00:29:43,That's so good.
00:29:43,00:29:48,"And Britain is another nation that loves bananas, currently and historically."
00:29:48,00:29:53,So Britain bananas in Jamaica have a very intertwined history.
00:29:53,00:29:58,It was a huge export from Jamaica to Britain around the turn of the 20th century.
00:29:58,00:30:03,"And in World War II, Britain had to suddenly requisition all of its, or a lot of its trade"
00:30:03,00:30:06,ships to be used in the military.
00:30:06,00:30:10,So that included the ships that were bringing bananas from Jamaica to the UK.
00:30:10,00:30:12,But that was going to screw Jamaica's economy.
00:30:12,00:30:16,"So basically, Jamaica kept on churning out loads and loads of bananas for Britain, put"
00:30:16,00:30:20,"them on a ship, and then immediately just tipped them all into the ocean."
00:30:20,00:30:21,What?
00:30:21,00:30:22,The ocean was just full of bananas.
00:30:22,00:30:26,"If you went for a swim off the beaches of Jamaica in World War II, it was just bananas"
00:30:26,00:30:27,layering.
00:30:27,00:30:28,And that's how the banana boat was invented.
00:30:28,00:30:31,"And that's what it is, yes."
00:30:31,00:30:32,Yeah.
00:30:32,00:30:33,"Honestly, that's amazing."
00:30:33,00:30:34,It's so cool.
00:30:34,00:30:36,"And they were, of course, they were rationed in Britain, well, you couldn't get"
00:30:36,00:30:38,them in Britain because they weren't being imported.
00:30:38,00:30:41,And there was this panic that Brits would have lost their taste for bananas because the whole
00:30:41,00:30:47,"generation grew up without, and rationing famously, went on in Britain until about 1950."
00:30:47,00:30:51,"So when the ban was lifted, the first shipment of bananas arrived into Liverpool, actually"
00:30:51,00:30:55,"from Sierra Leone, they arrived and the bananas were overripe."
00:30:55,00:30:59,"They didn't want to throw them away because, you know, that's a waste, and what do you"
00:30:59,00:31:00,do with them?
00:31:00,00:31:01,Big banana bread.
00:31:01,00:31:03,"So they said, oh, they should have done a big loaf."
00:31:03,00:31:04,They didn't.
00:31:04,00:31:07,"They just got all the dot workers, and they said, can you eat as many of these as you"
00:31:07,00:31:08,can?
00:31:08,00:31:09,"Oh, really?"
00:31:09,00:31:10,"So they went through 37,000."
00:31:10,00:31:13,They ate 12 bananas each.
00:31:13,00:31:14,Call the Vatican.
00:31:14,00:31:17,We have a banana emergency.
00:31:17,00:31:18,Okay.
00:31:18,00:31:19,Yellow.
00:31:19,00:31:25,So the Ecuadorian banana is a little too big for Britain.
00:31:25,00:31:26,Oh.
00:31:26,00:31:27,So I read a really interesting interview.
00:31:27,00:31:28,What does that mean?
00:31:28,00:31:30,"Well, I would read a great interview with the managing director of Fife's in the UK."
00:31:30,00:31:34,"They're a great big banana company, and he's called John Hawkins, and he said, the Ecuadorian"
00:31:34,00:31:37,banana is a bit too big for the UK market.
00:31:37,00:31:40,"It's only a couple of centimetres that it's too big, but it's enough for the housewife"
00:31:40,00:31:43,to say it's more than a meal.
00:31:43,00:31:47,"Whereas he says, I'm not trying to put any emphasis on any of this, but he says the German"
00:31:47,00:31:51,housefraut loves the length of an Ecuadorian banana.
00:31:51,00:31:54,"Well, she needs to take due after all those broken penises."
00:31:54,00:31:58,"I'm going to have to move this on and say, guys."
00:31:58,00:32:03,You don't want to hear about the ratio shifting ratio between British banana and turlip consumption.
00:32:03,00:32:08,"Screw this time frame, we've said ourselves."
00:32:08,00:32:09,"Go Andy, go."
00:32:09,00:32:10,Fly my friend.
00:32:10,00:32:11,Fly my beauty.
00:32:11,00:32:19,"Listen, better be good."
00:32:19,00:32:32,"It's just that in the 1970s, the average British adult ate 84 grams of bananas each week and"
00:32:32,00:32:34,40 grams of turlip.
00:32:34,00:32:41,"But now we, well, steady, steady, that's just the set up."
00:32:41,00:32:49,Now we eat 200 grams of banana each week and just 12 grams of turlip.
00:32:49,00:33:00,It's so sad.
00:33:00,00:33:02,And it's time for our final fact of the show.
00:33:02,00:33:04,And that is James.
00:33:04,00:33:05,Okay.
00:33:05,00:33:11,My fact this week is that neo toddlerism is the idea that you can change the world by
00:33:11,00:33:14,acting like a three year old.
00:33:14,00:33:15,Okay.
00:33:15,00:33:24,"And I must admit, I did come up with this fact before the recent events in America."
00:33:24,00:33:25,What's happened?
00:33:25,00:33:27,I've not seen the news.
00:33:27,00:33:28,"Don't worry about it, Dan."
00:33:28,00:33:33,So this comes from an article by a blogger called Govinda Bogle.
00:33:33,00:33:36,It seems like he came up with the idea.
00:33:36,00:33:41,"He is, he writes about psychology and the modern world and stuff like that."
00:33:41,00:33:46,"And he came up with the idea that it's like, you know, you get people who are throwing"
00:33:46,00:33:53,super paintings or going to the Republican convention dressed as babies.
00:33:53,00:33:57,"And they reckon basically you're trying to, you're having to do these stunts because"
00:33:57,00:34:00,of the world of tick tock and the world of social media.
00:34:00,00:34:03,And you're just trying to get a reaction just like a toddler would.
00:34:03,00:34:07,"You're just trying to get people to look at you, get people to see what you're doing."
00:34:07,00:34:08,And that is the way to.
00:34:08,00:34:09,I see.
00:34:09,00:34:10,"So it's about protest, basically."
00:34:10,00:34:11,It's about protest.
00:34:11,00:34:14,Not about people who are in charge acting like toddlers themselves.
00:34:14,00:34:19,"No, it's not so much that it's the, it's the modern way of protesting in order to defeat"
00:34:19,00:34:21,"toddlers is by using other toddlers, right?"
00:34:21,00:34:23,So maybe it's the best way to protest.
00:34:23,00:34:24,Is that how you do it?
00:34:24,00:34:25,Like a war of toddlers?
00:34:25,00:34:26,Yes.
00:34:26,00:34:27,Fire is fire.
00:34:27,00:34:28,The toddler is his toddlers.
00:34:28,00:34:32,"Whenever my child misbehaves, I bring in the village terror child."
00:34:32,00:34:39,But I hear about all these different theories and I just like the idea of neo-toddlerism
00:34:39,00:34:41,and I just like the idea of acting like a toddler.
00:34:41,00:34:43,You just want us all to do it protest still or not?
00:34:43,00:34:45,I just like having naps.
00:34:45,00:34:46,Yeah.
00:34:46,00:34:47,Okay.
00:34:47,00:34:50,That no one's protested by just having a nap every afternoon for two hours yet.
00:34:50,00:34:51,But they could.
00:34:51,00:34:52,Yeah.
00:34:52,00:34:53,He's very critical of it.
00:34:53,00:34:59,"And, you know, says that he uses some examples of protests that have been happening at the"
00:34:59,00:35:00,moment.
00:35:00,00:35:04,"You know, people in just up oil often through paint over paintings, ironically, to destroy"
00:35:04,00:35:05,them.
00:35:05,00:35:10,"And it's often soup over paintings, but they never throw a painting at a bowl of soup."
00:35:10,00:35:12,"No, they're not trying to destroy soup."
00:35:12,00:35:13,Are they?
00:35:13,00:35:14,But I would be interested in that.
00:35:14,00:35:17,"Like as a, just a, you know, cool variation on the thing."
00:35:17,00:35:21,The interesting thing that I read in no is they literally never even harm the paintings.
00:35:21,00:35:23,There's one painting which they very mildly harmed.
00:35:23,00:35:26,So I think it is quite interesting or the fuss about it.
00:35:26,00:35:31,But the other thing that this guy's point is that it's very impulsive and over-emotional
00:35:31,00:35:36,"and not very thoughtful protest, but he uses an example, things like the release of worms"
00:35:36,00:35:40,and maggots into Netanyahu's hotel room at the Watergate.
00:35:40,00:35:42,And that takes a huge amount of forward planning.
00:35:42,00:35:43,Yeah.
00:35:43,00:35:46,"I wouldn't be able to, where are you sourcing a huge number of worms and maggots?"
00:35:46,00:35:50,I was trying to look for worms recently and it takes ages even to find one.
00:35:50,00:35:51,"You're in the ground, Anna."
00:35:51,00:35:52,Yeah.
00:35:52,00:35:53,Okay.
00:35:53,00:35:55,How much do you find enough to overwhelm a hotel room?
00:35:55,00:35:59,I don't think he opened the door and a wall of worms fell out on top of it.
00:35:59,00:36:00,And maggots.
00:36:00,00:36:04,"There's a maximum happy number of worms in your hotel room, which is zero."
00:36:04,00:36:07,So any advance on that is technically a good process.
00:36:07,00:36:08,Yeah.
00:36:08,00:36:09,"But it can't be just two, can it?"
00:36:09,00:36:11,"He's not going to walk in and go, ""Waaaaaah!"""
00:36:11,00:36:12,Yeah.
00:36:12,00:36:15,"Well, as soon as he tries to cut them up to throw them away, he's got four worms."
00:36:15,00:36:16,So that's true.
00:36:16,00:36:21,"Do you know, the idea that they're not forward planning is not strictly true."
00:36:21,00:36:25,So the very famous incident that happened in London not too long ago was Van Gogh's
00:36:25,00:36:27,Sunflowers.
00:36:27,00:36:32,"Anna Holland and Phoebe Plummer, they came in and they threw tomato soup at it."
00:36:32,00:36:35,But they went in and they staked the joint.
00:36:35,00:36:39,They went a few days before and they brought in cans of tomato soup to see if that would
00:36:39,00:36:40,make it past security.
00:36:40,00:36:44,They went back to an Airbnb that they were staying in and they went into the showers
00:36:44,00:36:50,in there and had to work out at what angle do you throw tin soup at an item?
00:36:50,00:36:51,Really?
00:36:51,00:36:52,Yeah.
00:36:52,00:36:53,So they went in and they tried all the different things that you could do.
00:36:53,00:36:58,They had it all planned out to the point where there were journalists planted in there.
00:36:58,00:36:59,So that's how much forward thinking was.
00:36:59,00:37:04,They informed media who were waiting silently knowing that this was going to happen.
00:37:04,00:37:07,But there was a bunch of kids who were sitting and doing their own little sketches of it.
00:37:07,00:37:12,So they had to wait ages for these kids to do these drawings and eventually they moved
00:37:12,00:37:16,"away and they threw the soup, it went on it."
00:37:16,00:37:20,"They glued their hands to the wall and then they got arrested, right?"
00:37:20,00:37:22,Now they thought that they were going to get off because they thought there was a good
00:37:22,00:37:23,point to it.
00:37:23,00:37:25,They have been found guilty and they are serving time.
00:37:25,00:37:30,And the thing that they got busted for is that the frame that was housing the Van Gogh
00:37:30,00:37:34,"painting was incredibly old, 1700s."
00:37:34,00:37:39,It was incredibly expensive and the soup went on it and the acid burnt away a bunch of the
00:37:39,00:37:40,frames.
00:37:40,00:37:41,Yeah.
00:37:41,00:37:43,So do they put it in my Heinz tomato soup?
00:37:43,00:37:48,"Sorry, when I spill a little bit of soup it doesn't burn through my table."
00:37:48,00:37:49,It's a good point.
00:37:49,00:37:50,It's an excellent point.
00:37:50,00:37:53,Do you know why just a pile use orange?
00:37:53,00:37:56,So they often do orange paint in their things.
00:37:56,00:37:57,Shows up well?
00:37:57,00:37:58,"Shows up well, definitely."
00:37:58,00:37:59,"In fact, I will come to that."
00:37:59,00:38:04,"So they say it's a symbol of hope because it's a bright colour, all this."
00:38:04,00:38:09,But actually orange has been used in environmental protests for quite a long time and that is
00:38:09,00:38:13,because green and orange are clashing colours.
00:38:13,00:38:17,"So green and red are complementary colours, they're exactly opposite on the colour wheel."
00:38:17,00:38:22,"But if you just go one away from red, suddenly the colours really, really clash."
00:38:22,00:38:27,And so for ages and ages it's always been used in green protest because it looks very
00:38:27,00:38:29,artificial because it looks the opposite of green.
00:38:29,00:38:32,And did you deliberately wear a green and orange shirt tonight that everyone's been
00:38:32,00:38:35,having to look at for the last hour and a half already?
00:38:35,00:38:36,I'm done as well.
00:38:36,00:38:37,Jesus Christ.
00:38:37,00:38:41,"Jesus Christ, you haven't seen Andy's underpants."
00:38:41,00:38:43,Thank God.
00:38:43,00:38:47,"I was looking at protests, what works, what doesn't."
00:38:47,00:38:51,And there was this really interesting study that came out quite recently by a Harvard
00:38:51,00:38:56,academic called Erica Chenoweth who she found that nonviolent campaigns twice as likely
00:38:56,00:39:00,"to achieve their goals as violent campaigns, which is quite useful and all these campaigns"
00:39:00,00:39:04,"that are being referred to, then it's not violent unless you count kind of drenching"
00:39:04,00:39:07,something in a tasty liquid as violence.
00:39:07,00:39:13,"And the really interesting revelation she had, and she looked at a lot of sort of successful"
00:39:13,00:39:18,"protests basically where they've stated their aim and then their aim has been achieved,"
00:39:18,00:39:23,"found that as soon as 3.5% of the population is actively involved in a movement, the success"
00:39:23,00:39:25,rate is 100%.
00:39:25,00:39:26,Wow.
00:39:26,00:39:27,Wow.
00:39:27,00:39:31,"And she looked at, I think it was over, it was a couple of hundred, I think, protests."
00:39:31,00:39:34,"So in Australia, for instance, that's about a million people."
00:39:34,00:39:39,"If you have a cause, if you're really popular, you can rope in a million people, 100% chance"
00:39:39,00:39:40,it's going to work.
00:39:40,00:39:44,It's the same number of people who will go on a cruise ship holiday this year in Australia.
00:39:44,00:39:45,So if you've got all of them.
00:39:45,00:39:52,"Just tell them you're not returning to shore until you sign the petition, yeah."
00:39:52,00:39:57,"Some things that toddlers are good at, 10 pin bowling."
00:39:57,00:39:58,So the world's...
00:39:58,00:39:59,In what capacity?
00:39:59,00:40:00,Well.
00:40:00,00:40:01,Are they?
00:40:01,00:40:06,Possibly the world's best 10 pin bowler is an Aussie called Jason Belmontay from New
00:40:06,00:40:07,South Wales.
00:40:07,00:40:16,"He's won 31 world titles and he bowls like a child because when he was a toddler, that's"
00:40:16,00:40:20,when he learned he wasn't strong enough to lift up the ball with one hand and roll it.
00:40:20,00:40:25,So he used two hands and sort of rolled it that way and he carried it on his whole life
00:40:25,00:40:26,and now he's the best in the world.
00:40:26,00:40:27,Wow.
00:40:27,00:40:28,Get out.
00:40:28,00:40:29,It's plausible.
00:40:29,00:40:32,"The number of times I've been bowling, are you not the same?"
00:40:32,00:40:37,And you go for like a really graceful long hard bowl and it just tips one over and you
00:40:37,00:40:41,have the idiot who's never done it before who bumps it along and knocks them all down.
00:40:41,00:40:44,He's the only 30 time winner in PBA Tour history.
00:40:44,00:40:47,He does use those barriers.
00:40:47,00:40:48,What?
00:40:48,00:40:49,"No, he doesn't."
00:40:49,00:40:56,I was so angry then.
00:40:56,00:40:57,It's allowed.
00:40:57,00:40:59,It's a little known rule of bowling.
00:40:59,00:41:01,They're not allowed to turn you down.
00:41:01,00:41:05,Can I tell you guys about my favorite protest that I've learned about?
00:41:05,00:41:11,"So we all probably remember back in the day when the Beatles were sort of at their height,"
00:41:11,00:41:18,"1966, John Lennon made some comments where he said that we are bigger than Christ, right?"
00:41:18,00:41:23,And this angered so many people to the point that the Beatles were being boycotted by radio
00:41:23,00:41:24,stations.
00:41:24,00:41:27,"They were burning their stuff, burning all their records in all of John Lennon's books."
00:41:27,00:41:33,"In particular, there was a radio station called Clue and Clue organized a bonfire."
00:41:33,00:41:35,So it had a thousand people there.
00:41:35,00:41:36,They all threw in their records.
00:41:36,00:41:38,It all burnt and so on.
00:41:38,00:41:40,That's a famous story that happened.
00:41:40,00:41:42,This next bit is less famous.
00:41:42,00:41:49,There is a theory that God agreed with John Lennon theory.
00:41:49,00:41:51,You're going to have to continue with that.
00:41:51,00:41:54,Otherwise you've just said nonsense.
00:41:54,00:41:57,"So what happened is they did the bonfire, they burned all their stuff."
00:41:57,00:42:01,"No, the next day, Clue's transmitter tower was struck by lightning."
00:42:01,00:42:05,"All the equipment was knocked out completely and their news director, who's basically running"
00:42:05,00:42:11,"the whole thing, got hit, got knocked out and rushed to hospital and they didn't get back"
00:42:11,00:42:13,on for another day or so.
00:42:13,00:42:18,"So God was effectively going, ""I love the Beatles."""
00:42:18,00:42:19,It's a theory.
00:42:19,00:42:22,"That's Old Testament God, isn't it?"
00:42:22,00:42:25,It's a proper Old School God.
00:42:25,00:42:26,I say it's a popular theory.
00:42:26,00:42:31,"I sort of invented it for this show, but I think it's got legs."
00:42:31,00:42:35,"Just another 999,999 people to convince."
00:42:35,00:42:41,"Do you want to hear some toddler things, sort of genuine toddlers?"
00:42:41,00:42:44,"I don't know if any of you are familiar with the Reddit of why my kid is crying, but it's"
00:42:44,00:42:45,unbelievably good.
00:42:45,00:42:48,I just picked a few favorite examples.
00:42:48,00:42:55,"Because I wouldn't let her eat a snotty tissue, both three-year-olds were inconsolable because"
00:42:55,00:42:58,they wanted to hold the bag of poo I was taking to the bin.
00:42:58,00:43:02,"And maybe my favorite, why is my kid crying?"
00:43:02,00:43:07,Because Daddy's fart was louder than hers.
00:43:07,00:43:09,It's a very vulnerable age.
00:43:09,00:43:10,You've got to be careful.
00:43:10,00:43:12,"You've got to be careful, yeah."
00:43:12,00:43:18,I find it very interesting the different levels at which toddlers develop and how it actually
00:43:18,00:43:21,is basically even across the world.
00:43:21,00:43:27,So the age at which kids walk is pretty much even maybe give or take a week or two weeks
00:43:27,00:43:30,"across the world, except in Tajikistan."
00:43:30,00:43:31,What?
00:43:31,00:43:32,Yeah.
00:43:32,00:43:33,It's so weird.
00:43:33,00:43:34,What?
00:43:34,00:43:37,"And there's this amazing thing that every single Tajik parent does pretty much, which"
00:43:37,00:43:43,"is that they have these things called Gavoras, which are cradles, but their kids stay in"
00:43:43,00:43:44,all the time.
00:43:44,00:43:47,"So for the first six months of their life, their kids are in it literally for 23 hours"
00:43:47,00:43:48,a day.
00:43:48,00:43:53,"For the next six months, it's more like maybe 16 hours a day."
00:43:53,00:43:58,"And they're lying in a cradle and they're strapped down fully, so only their head moves."
00:43:58,00:44:02,"And there's a hole cut in the bottom of the cradle, and they've got a bare bottom."
00:44:02,00:44:06,And so any poo just falls out into a bucket underneath.
00:44:06,00:44:10,And there's a tube attached to them so that any wee gets siphoned into wherever it gets
00:44:10,00:44:11,siphoned.
00:44:11,00:44:12,What?
00:44:12,00:44:13,And this is how they live.
00:44:13,00:44:15,And this is what all Tajik mothers do.
00:44:15,00:44:17,Almost 100% of Tajik mothers do this.
00:44:17,00:44:21,And they spend nine to 23 hours a day in it until they're three or four.
00:44:21,00:44:24,"So understandably, they are a bit slower to crawl."
00:44:24,00:44:29,"So by the age of one, almost all infants in most cultures are crawling."
00:44:29,00:44:32,Only 60% of Tajik children do it.
00:44:32,00:44:35,"The good news is the fascinating thing is that by four, they've all caught up."
00:44:35,00:44:39,"So it doesn't really make a blind bit of difference, these things, when you're thinking, ""Oh, my"
00:44:39,00:44:41,"child's not talking or walking."""
00:44:41,00:44:42,But isn't that mad?
00:44:42,00:44:47,"Their kids are just strapped to a cradle with a poo hole in the bottom for three years,"
00:44:47,00:44:48,the first three years of their life.
00:44:48,00:44:49,That is crazy.
00:44:49,00:44:50,Insane.
00:44:50,00:44:51,I know.
00:44:51,00:44:52,It's great.
00:44:52,00:44:53,What a life.
00:44:53,00:44:54,What a great life.
00:44:54,00:44:56,That is a good life.
00:44:56,00:45:01,I really thought Dan's John Lennon Christ God lightning thing was going to be the weirdest
00:45:01,00:45:03,thing we heard during this fact.
00:45:03,00:45:07,"We're going to have to wrap up very soon, guys."
00:45:07,00:45:10,Can I give you a couple of old-fashioned words for children?
00:45:10,00:45:11,Sure.
00:45:11,00:45:12,Sure.
00:45:12,00:45:20,"There's a squeaker, which was defined as a bar boy, also a bastard or any other child."
00:45:20,00:45:24,"There's a tit, which was an old name for a Prim Young lass."
00:45:24,00:45:25,You tit.
00:45:25,00:45:29,I think that's not how you speak to a Prim Young lass.
00:45:29,00:45:31,It is how I do.
00:45:31,00:45:38,"A bandling is just a child, a braggling is a 16th-century child, sucker is from 1384"
00:45:38,00:45:44,"for a child who's still nursing, sucker, and chitty face is a little puny child."
00:45:44,00:45:47,If you want to just keep that word and keep it going.
00:45:47,00:45:48,Right.
00:45:48,00:45:51,"So there's handy for if your friends are new parents, you can throw those their way."
00:45:51,00:45:53,"Oh, what a lovely little chitty face."
00:45:53,00:45:58,"I found a thing which is a stubborn child law, and this was used in the General Court"
00:45:58,00:46:01,of Massachusetts in 1646.
00:46:01,00:46:06,So this is the description of what you as a parent are allowed to do if you have a tantrum
00:46:06,00:46:07,child.
00:46:07,00:46:12,"""Shall his father and mother, being his natural parents, lay hold of him and bring him to"
00:46:12,00:46:17,the magistrates assembled in court to testify on them that their son is stubborn and rebellious
00:46:17,00:46:23,"and will not obey their voice and lives with notorious crimes, and such a son shall be put"
00:46:23,00:46:24,"to death."""
00:46:24,00:46:25,Not?
00:46:25,00:46:26,Yeah.
00:46:26,00:46:29,It's a real plot twist right at the end there.
00:46:29,00:46:34,Is there no option of just having a word with them first?
00:46:34,00:46:35,Wow.
00:46:35,00:46:36,Yeah.
00:46:36,00:46:43,"Octopuses, throw tantrums, and at once, especially males when they don't get sex."
00:46:43,00:46:45,"Sorry, octopuses, you said."
00:46:45,00:46:46,Octopuses.
00:46:46,00:46:49,I must have misheard that as humans.
00:46:49,00:46:50,Okay.
00:46:50,00:46:56,"All right, that is it, everyone."
00:46:56,00:46:57,That is all of our facts.
00:46:57,00:46:59,"Thank you so much, Brisbane."
00:46:59,00:47:00,That was awesome.
00:47:00,00:47:01,It's amazing being here.
00:47:01,00:47:03,"We will be back again, and we'll be back again next week with another episode."
00:47:03,00:47:04,We'll see you then.
00:47:04,00:47:04,Goodbye!
