00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:15.760
 Hello and welcome to another episode of No Such Thing as a Fish,

00:00:15.760 --> 00:00:19.800
 a weekly podcast this week coming to you live from Brisbane.

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:24.720
 >> [APPLAUSE]

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:26.760
 >> My name is Dan Shriver.

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:31.880
 I'm sitting here with Anna Tushinsky, Andrew Hunter Murray, and James Harkin.

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:35.200
 And once again, we have gathered around the microphones with our four favorite

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:40.800
 facts from the last seven days and in no particular order, here we go.

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:43.840
 Starting with fact number one, and that is my fact.

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:50.320
 My fact this week is that Christmas is a very dangerous time for German penises.

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:52.200
 >> [LAUGH]

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:56.240
 >> This is a little study that was released last year where

00:00:56.240 --> 00:01:00.440
 German scientists were looking into the rate of hospital visits

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:04.640
 whereby someone has walked in and said, I think I've snapped my penis.

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:05.800
 >> Snapped?

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:07.680
 >> You hear a crack when it happens.

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:08.880
 >> No, too much.

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:10.400
 >> Well, that's what we're talking about unfortunately.

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:11.760
 >> Merry Christmas.

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:14.320
 >> Is this going to be our Christmas special?

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:17.280
 >> Yeah, I think, yeah, a Christmas special and

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:20.000
 a sort of health and safety message.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:20.880
 >> Public service.

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:22.400
 >> Yeah, so.

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:26.040
 >> So actually, okay, to say that, that would happen if people are having sex, right?

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:28.080
 So are we saying that more people are having sex and

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:29.320
 that's why they're injuring themselves?

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:30.560
 >> Exactly, they're in party mode.

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:31.280
 >> I see.

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:34.320
 >> And so a lot more sex happens in that period.

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:38.960
 It says the injury tends to occur during wild sex,

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:43.480
 particularly in positions where you're not in direct eye contact.

00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:47.200
 >> [LAUGH]

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:48.840
 >> I'll always maintain eye contact, though.

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:50.080
 >> [LAUGH]

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:53.080
 >> There's no such, I don't think there is such a position, is there?

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:54.320
 We're not in direct eye contact.

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:55.800
 >> [LAUGH]

00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:57.400
 >> Not in my order.

00:01:57.400 --> 00:02:01.100
 >> [LAUGH]

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:03.240
 >> And by the way, Australia, you think you're getting off lightly.

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:06.240
 It's also a dangerous time for Australian penises, so be careful.

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:10.760
 There was a Queensland doctor who said the cases had spiked by sort of 20,

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:12.440
 I think, no, 50%, I think it was.

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:13.520
 >> Wow, in that period?

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:14.240
 >> Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:15.120
 >> Wow.

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:18.800
 >> It settles down about New Year's time in Germany for German penises.

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:22.200
 There's less sex at the New Year period.

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:25.120
 So it sort of calms down by the end of the year.

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:30.400
 But yeah, it's apparently when people go in with this injury,

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:37.120
 it's quite a sight, the term color of an aubergine is often used.

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:39.040
 >> My God.

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:39.560
 >> Yeah.

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:41.600
 >> I am never using that emoji ever again.

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:43.680
 >> [LAUGH]

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:48.280
 >> And it apparently remained consistent during the COVID-19 pandemic.

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:51.400
 >> Right. >> Yeah, so that didn't dent it at all in that period.

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:53.640
 >> No, it snapped it, I really forgot.

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:55.480
 >> [LAUGH]

00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:55.960
 >> Yeah.

00:02:55.960 --> 00:03:00.280
 >> That's why, because that's not the most dangerous phenomenon for penises.

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:00.640
 >> What do you mean?

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:01.560
 >> Which I thought it might be.

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:05.480
 Well, the thing that causes most penis injuries, most penis hospital visits,

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:06.800
 probably guessable.

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:08.280
 >> Vacuum cleaners.

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:08.840
 >> Okay.

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:10.400
 >> [LAUGH]

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:11.160
 >> Yeah, yeah.

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:14.160
 >> I knew I was gonna overshare as soon as I opened my mouth then.

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:16.160
 >> Yeah, you should have waited a split second for

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:19.160
 that chap in the audience to interrupt you with the correct answer.

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:22.920
 Because I think you just said flies, and it is flies.

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:27.200
 >> I thought you said wives, and I thought, [LAUGH]

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:29.040
 >> Girlfriends can do it too.

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:30.200
 >> Flies, of course.

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:33.000
 >> Zippers, yeah, people getting zipped up in them.

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:37.360
 Accounts for not 0.5% of ER visits altogether, which I think is quite high.

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:38.440
 >> That is quite a lot.

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:42.680
 >> One in 200, mostly children or younger teenagers.

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:45.840
 When you're not quite, you haven't learned yet that it's there.

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:46.720
 >> [LAUGH]

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:47.880
 >> It takes a few years.

00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:49.460
 >> Yes, yeah, yeah.

00:03:49.460 --> 00:03:52.720
 >> In 13th century England, Christmas was a very dangerous time for

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:58.840
 testicles if you were a person who made money, if you were working in the mint.

00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:03.960
 Because the penalty for debasing coinage was cutting off the money as right hand

00:04:03.960 --> 00:04:08.320
 and right testicle, and nailing it to the door of the smithy.

00:04:08.320 --> 00:04:10.720
 And then- >> Wait a second.

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:12.080
 These coins are all made of chocolate.

00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:14.240
 >> [LAUGH]

00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:18.560
 >> Yeah, because in 1125, on Christmas Day, Henry I got all of the

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:22.600
 moneys to Winchester and had one of their balls chopped off.

00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:23.680
 >> On Christmas Day?

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:25.760
 >> Christmas Day, wow.

00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:28.280
 >> Well, so he had one of each of their balls chopped off?

00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:30.080
 Or just he picked one out of a hat.

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:34.120
 >> No, no, it wasn't out of a hat, he got all the moneys in.

00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:38.120
 I think about there were like four or five of them who got off, not in that way.

00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:40.640
 >> [LAUGH]

00:04:40.640 --> 00:04:43.040
 >> Can I ask you guys a quick question?

00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:46.120
 >> Yes, has anyone on this panel, and I'll put this out to the room as well,

00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:48.880
 does anyone know anyone who's ever had a broken penis?

00:04:48.880 --> 00:04:49.320
 >> No.

00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:50.080
 >> No.

00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:51.440
 >> It's okay, a few people have.

00:04:51.440 --> 00:04:53.840
 >> What do you mean, like hospital level broken?

00:04:53.840 --> 00:04:55.920
 >> Yeah. >> Or googling it in a panic level broken.

00:04:55.920 --> 00:05:03.400
 >> [LAUGH]

00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:04.280
 >> But I know both.

00:05:04.280 --> 00:05:07.280
 >> [LAUGH]

00:05:07.280 --> 00:05:11.800
 >> I know two people, so one was a kid on our school bus in Sydney.

00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:15.560
 He was, I wasn't there on this day annoyingly, but they gave him a wedgie that

00:05:15.560 --> 00:05:20.180
 was so hard that, and so they lifted him to like the top bar.

00:05:20.180 --> 00:05:23.360
 And then he went, a different sound came out of this,

00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:25.640
 like a guttural animal sound came out.

00:05:25.640 --> 00:05:28.120
 And he was missing for weeks, cuz his penis had snapped.

00:05:28.120 --> 00:05:29.520
 So that was one person.

00:05:29.520 --> 00:05:32.920
 And then the second person, the three of you do know.

00:05:32.920 --> 00:05:33.600
 >> Great.

00:05:33.600 --> 00:05:35.880
 >> [LAUGH]

00:05:35.880 --> 00:05:37.340
 >> It's me, no, it's not me.

00:05:37.340 --> 00:05:39.600
 >> [LAUGH]

00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:41.840
 >> It's a guest who's been on our show.

00:05:41.840 --> 00:05:44.320
 Someone who broke their member on- >> Sandy Toxic.

00:05:44.320 --> 00:05:47.080
 >> [LAUGH]

00:05:47.080 --> 00:05:49.400
 >> Is it someone where this is public information or

00:05:49.400 --> 00:05:53.160
 are you the only person they told in secrecy and now it's going out to the world?

00:05:53.160 --> 00:05:55.080
 >> I think Stephen Fry said I could say this.

00:05:55.080 --> 00:05:56.640
 >> [LAUGH]

00:05:56.640 --> 00:05:59.060
 >> It was Johnny Knoxville of Jack Ass.

00:05:59.060 --> 00:06:00.040
 >> That makes a lot of sense.

00:06:00.040 --> 00:06:03.560
 >> Yeah, he puts himself at risk quite a lot, doesn't he?

00:06:03.560 --> 00:06:06.840
 >> He went over on a motorbike and he landed and he broke it.

00:06:06.840 --> 00:06:08.080
 And he's always asked about it.

00:06:08.080 --> 00:06:09.920
 He says this has been well documented.

00:06:09.920 --> 00:06:12.240
 So much has been said about so little.

00:06:12.240 --> 00:06:14.360
 >> [LAUGH]

00:06:14.360 --> 00:06:16.000
 >> And they said that he might not,

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:18.760
 it was gonna suffer from it, but he's had two kids since it happened.

00:06:18.760 --> 00:06:20.920
 So, yeah, it's all fine.

00:06:20.920 --> 00:06:21.920
 >> Can I talk about Christmas?

00:06:21.920 --> 00:06:22.520
 >> Yes, please.

00:06:22.520 --> 00:06:25.440
 >> Yeah, let's get away from, please, please, please.

00:06:25.440 --> 00:06:30.440
 Okay, do you want to hear an absolutely wild thing that happened in Christmas 1972?

00:06:30.440 --> 00:06:33.560
 Okay, it was sent in by a listener called Yara T, so thank you for this.

00:06:33.560 --> 00:06:37.240
 Marie Heffernan was a 13-year-old girl.

00:06:37.240 --> 00:06:39.280
 She had a Christmas dinner with her family, right?

00:06:39.280 --> 00:06:42.680
 In Australia, at their home near Wollongong, and she-

00:06:42.680 --> 00:06:43.520
 >> Wollongong?

00:06:43.520 --> 00:06:44.280
 >> Is that how it's pronounced?

00:06:44.280 --> 00:06:45.400
 >> [LAUGH]

00:06:45.400 --> 00:06:46.960
 >> Is it like that?

00:06:46.960 --> 00:06:49.640
 >> From the reaction, I'm not sure that's how you do pronounce it.

00:06:49.640 --> 00:06:51.200
 >> Wollongong.

00:06:51.200 --> 00:06:52.320
 >> You cannot, I am Australian, you cannot play.

00:06:52.320 --> 00:06:53.600
 >> What are you saying?

00:06:53.600 --> 00:06:55.240
 Wollongong, Wollongong.

00:06:55.240 --> 00:06:56.120
 >> Why are you not looking at me?

00:06:56.120 --> 00:06:57.240
 >> That's what I said.

00:06:57.240 --> 00:07:00.000
 I'm worried, you're gonna tell me about more penis stuff.

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:02.780
 >> He just wants some eye contact.

00:07:02.780 --> 00:07:03.280
 >> All right.

00:07:03.280 --> 00:07:08.240
 >> [LAUGH]

00:07:08.240 --> 00:07:11.400
 >> At their home near Wollongong.

00:07:11.400 --> 00:07:12.680
 So she had this Christmas dinner.

00:07:12.680 --> 00:07:16.760
 She got bad bronchitis and laryngitis after eating Christmas dinner, right?

00:07:16.760 --> 00:07:20.720
 It cleaned up, that sort of she got better, but her voice did not come back.

00:07:20.720 --> 00:07:23.080
 And the doctors just said, well, you've lost your voice due to a virus.

00:07:23.080 --> 00:07:27.400
 It could come back any time, but it's, you know, you have to just wait.

00:07:27.400 --> 00:07:32.200
 She waited for 12 years with no voice.

00:07:32.200 --> 00:07:37.040
 And then, suddenly, at the age of 25, she started to choke.

00:07:37.040 --> 00:07:38.920
 And this, she had a little coughing fit, and

00:07:38.920 --> 00:07:42.160
 it brought up this little sort of lump from her throat.

00:07:42.160 --> 00:07:45.360
 She took the lump to the Royal Canberra Hospital, where a doctor found it was not

00:07:45.360 --> 00:07:52.120
 human tissue, but a 1959 three penny coin that she had swallowed from the Christmas

00:07:52.120 --> 00:07:53.800
 pudding, or rather she hadn't swallowed it.

00:07:53.800 --> 00:07:58.800
 It got stuck between her vocal cords, so it was thin and in a horizontal position.

00:07:58.800 --> 00:08:01.160
 So the x-ray didn't see it when she was x-rayed.

00:08:01.160 --> 00:08:06.280
 So she had no voice for 12 years, because it had just stayed exactly in position

00:08:06.280 --> 00:08:07.880
 and stopped her vocal cords vibrating.

00:08:07.880 --> 00:08:11.480
 And then when they got it out, she went, I think there's a coin in my throat!

00:08:11.480 --> 00:08:17.560
 [LAUGHTER]

00:08:17.560 --> 00:08:18.560
 Isn't that...

00:08:18.560 --> 00:08:19.560
 That is mental.

00:08:19.560 --> 00:08:24.680
 That's a little weird version of the Little Mermaid, isn't it?

00:08:24.680 --> 00:08:29.800
 Yes, it's less contunes in that one, but yeah.

00:08:29.800 --> 00:08:30.800
 Yeah, anyway.

00:08:30.800 --> 00:08:34.680
 So the penis injuries aren't the most common injuries at Christmas, but there are quite

00:08:34.680 --> 00:08:38.040
 a lot of very Christmas-specific injuries, and I find it really interesting, because

00:08:38.040 --> 00:08:40.800
 they're all catalogued, and these stories come out at Christmas about what's the most

00:08:40.800 --> 00:08:44.840
 likely way you'll get injured, and the way they collect the data is from hospital visits.

00:08:44.840 --> 00:08:47.800
 And they're all things where you think, why have you gone to hospital?

00:08:47.800 --> 00:08:51.800
 So loads of people pull muscles getting turkey out of the oven.

00:08:51.800 --> 00:08:58.280
 Now, what kind of diligent Christmas housewife is getting a turkey out of the oven, spraining

00:08:58.280 --> 00:09:01.960
 a little bit of an arm, and demanding she goes to hospital, rather than serving up bloody

00:09:01.960 --> 00:09:03.800
 lunch like she should be?

00:09:03.800 --> 00:09:09.600
 Honestly, I just like to disassociate myself with that comment.

00:09:09.600 --> 00:09:13.480
 Welcome to Back to the 1950s.

00:09:13.480 --> 00:09:14.480
 Christmas in the 50s.

00:09:14.480 --> 00:09:20.440
 No, there's some other weird ones, like a woman who slipped while stapling a Christmas light,

00:09:20.440 --> 00:09:21.440
 stapled her left hand.

00:09:21.440 --> 00:09:23.400
 I've put a stapler in my hand.

00:09:23.400 --> 00:09:24.400
 They're very small.

00:09:24.400 --> 00:09:25.400
 Don't go to hospital.

00:09:25.400 --> 00:09:27.720
 Isn't this fair advice?

00:09:27.720 --> 00:09:31.160
 You are such a loss to the NHS, and I love you.

00:09:31.160 --> 00:09:32.160
 Get out.

00:09:32.160 --> 00:09:33.160
 Get out.

00:09:33.160 --> 00:09:34.160
 Get out.

00:09:34.160 --> 00:09:35.160
 Get out.

00:09:35.160 --> 00:09:36.160
 No.

00:09:36.160 --> 00:09:37.160
 No.

00:09:37.160 --> 00:09:38.160
 Just Google it.

00:09:38.160 --> 00:09:39.160
 No.

00:09:39.160 --> 00:09:40.160
 Google in a panic.

00:09:40.160 --> 00:09:42.160
 There was one where I thought, that's justified.

00:09:42.160 --> 00:09:46.080
 This was on Christmas Day, a moment where a mum noticed her five-year-old was picking

00:09:46.080 --> 00:09:50.720
 their nose, and when they got up closer to the five-year-old, they found that a foul odour

00:09:50.720 --> 00:09:54.960
 was coming out of their nose, and it was discovered the child had put a Christmas decoration in

00:09:54.960 --> 00:09:55.960
 their left nostril.

00:09:55.960 --> 00:10:00.760
 But what Christmas decoration emits a foul odour?

00:10:00.760 --> 00:10:03.520
 Maybe it had been there a while, or...

00:10:03.520 --> 00:10:04.960
 So, only Christmas Day?

00:10:04.960 --> 00:10:05.960
 No, you're right.

00:10:05.960 --> 00:10:06.960
 You're right.

00:10:06.960 --> 00:10:09.520
 Well, there are always dogs that swallow tinsel, and then you have to pick a deer.

00:10:09.520 --> 00:10:11.040
 Don't go to any for them, either.

00:10:11.040 --> 00:10:12.040
 No.

00:10:12.040 --> 00:10:14.160
 But you have to remove it from the other end, often, don't you?

00:10:14.160 --> 00:10:15.160
 You do.

00:10:15.160 --> 00:10:17.560
 It's called a linear foreign body, if you're a vet.

00:10:17.560 --> 00:10:18.560
 Do you?

00:10:18.560 --> 00:10:19.560
 Yeah.

00:10:19.560 --> 00:10:22.160
 Is there any point where it's still coming through the mouth, and you're removing it

00:10:22.160 --> 00:10:23.160
 from the other side?

00:10:23.160 --> 00:10:27.360
 I don't believe that sort of permanent dog floss has been invented, though.

00:10:27.360 --> 00:10:28.360
 Interesting.

00:10:28.360 --> 00:10:29.360
 Yeah.

00:10:29.360 --> 00:10:30.360
 Sorry.

00:10:30.360 --> 00:10:35.360
 Yeah, America has a similar database where they log down all the Christmas injuries.

00:10:35.360 --> 00:10:36.360
 Do you know what it is?

00:10:36.360 --> 00:10:37.920
 Are you talking about NICE?

00:10:37.920 --> 00:10:38.920
 Yeah.

00:10:38.920 --> 00:10:39.920
 So, NICE, NEISS.

00:10:39.920 --> 00:10:44.360
 Sorry to jump across again, but National Electronic Injury Surveillance System, it records all

00:10:44.360 --> 00:10:45.360
 the data.

00:10:45.360 --> 00:10:48.960
 And NICE is an anagram of NISA, which is the Danish for ELF.

00:10:48.960 --> 00:10:49.960
 Oh, my God.

00:10:49.960 --> 00:10:50.960
 Yeah.

00:10:50.960 --> 00:10:51.960
 Wow.

00:10:51.960 --> 00:10:52.960
 What's going on there?

00:10:52.960 --> 00:10:53.960
 What's going on, Andy?

00:10:53.960 --> 00:10:54.960
 Yeah.

00:10:54.960 --> 00:10:55.960
 And NICE is also naughty or NICE.

00:10:55.960 --> 00:10:56.960
 Yeah.

00:10:56.960 --> 00:10:57.960
 What's going on?

00:10:57.960 --> 00:10:58.960
 What are they hiding?

00:10:58.960 --> 00:11:02.960
 Well, I think we'll all agree that was worth the interruption.

00:11:02.960 --> 00:11:08.960
 But so, yeah, they published a report in 2009.

00:11:08.960 --> 00:11:11.960
 Do you want to go to the hospital for that first?

00:11:11.960 --> 00:11:14.960
 I feel like I do.

00:11:14.960 --> 00:11:20.960
 2014, 809 people were admitted into ER in the States for Christmas-based injuries.

00:11:20.960 --> 00:11:24.360
 There's a lot of normal ones, almost similar to the ones that you were talking about, Anna,

00:11:24.360 --> 00:11:26.460
 about pieces getting stuck and so on.

00:11:26.460 --> 00:11:27.620
 This one's interesting.

00:11:27.620 --> 00:11:33.020
 This was a 21-year-old man who, according to the database, was riding on a TV when he

00:11:33.020 --> 00:11:39.320
 ran into a turkey and lost control and then ran into a tree.

00:11:39.320 --> 00:11:41.160
 No more information supplied.

00:11:41.160 --> 00:11:46.560
 Another big Christmas setback or mess up that you can have is food poisoning.

00:11:46.560 --> 00:11:47.560
 Oh, yeah.

00:11:47.560 --> 00:11:50.120
 Because if you don't cook a turkey enough or anything, I guess.

00:11:50.120 --> 00:11:55.000
 So in 2013, there was a group of Norwegian seafood researchers from Norway's National

00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:58.260
 Institute of Nutrition and Seafood Research, and they thought, "Let's have a Christmas

00:11:58.260 --> 00:11:59.760
 party.

00:11:59.760 --> 00:12:04.320
 Why don't we use some lovely local cockles, and we'll serve them raw, but we'll pour boiling

00:12:04.320 --> 00:12:05.600
 soup all over them."

00:12:05.600 --> 00:12:07.680
 So that will theoretically be absolutely fine.

00:12:07.680 --> 00:12:08.680
 Okay.

00:12:08.680 --> 00:12:10.680
 All of them got horrific food poisoning.

00:12:10.680 --> 00:12:13.920
 And then, because they were the investigators, they had to investigate their own Christmas

00:12:13.920 --> 00:12:16.420
 party to see what had caused it.

00:12:16.420 --> 00:12:19.340
 The problem was that the soup was gaspacho, wasn't it?

00:12:19.340 --> 00:12:26.000
 Yeah, that's right.

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:30.640
 It is time for fact number two, and that is Anna.

00:12:30.640 --> 00:12:36.520
 My fact this week is that the value of goods Americans refund each year is more than the

00:12:36.520 --> 00:12:40.200
 GDP of 90% of the world's countries.

00:12:40.200 --> 00:12:41.200
 What?

00:12:41.200 --> 00:12:42.200
 What?

00:12:42.200 --> 00:12:43.200
 What?

00:12:43.200 --> 00:12:44.720
 It is a big problem.

00:12:44.720 --> 00:12:49.380
 By some estimates, it takes you to an amount that is more than all but the richest 19 countries

00:12:49.380 --> 00:12:50.820
 in the world's GDP.

00:12:50.820 --> 00:12:56.420
 So Switzerland is about where you get to at which point Switzerland is financially a smaller

00:12:56.420 --> 00:13:00.140
 country than the returned goods of the United States of America.

00:13:00.140 --> 00:13:03.900
 It's also more than America spends on roads, railways, and airports put together.

00:13:03.900 --> 00:13:08.300
 I don't know what's like here in Oz at the moment, but back in the UK, I feel like there

00:13:08.300 --> 00:13:13.340
 needs to be a lane specifically now for people returning items, because that's what you're

00:13:13.340 --> 00:13:16.320
 stuck behind when you're trying to buy something in a physical shop.

00:13:16.320 --> 00:13:20.520
 What it is is people are buying clothes, going out and partying one night, and then returning

00:13:20.520 --> 00:13:21.520
 it the next day.

00:13:21.520 --> 00:13:26.520
 They found that all these people who are returning stuff, there's just obvious patterns.

00:13:26.520 --> 00:13:30.360
 People who buy portable generators during weather emergencies, they'll use them right

00:13:30.360 --> 00:13:34.840
 until the emergency is ended, and then all of those go back, just as huge amount goes

00:13:34.840 --> 00:13:35.840
 back.

00:13:35.840 --> 00:13:41.120
 There's a big culture of lots and lots of refunds as well.

00:13:41.120 --> 00:13:45.860
 You're entitled to a refund for lots of stuff, so in the USA, Petco will take back fish that

00:13:45.860 --> 00:13:47.180
 have died.

00:13:47.180 --> 00:13:49.240
 You can get a refund if your fish has died.

00:13:49.240 --> 00:13:51.040
 Like the Monty Python sketch.

00:13:51.040 --> 00:13:53.720
 Pretty much, except they just don't quibble.

00:13:53.720 --> 00:14:00.140
 And Home Depot lets you return dead plants for a year.

00:14:00.140 --> 00:14:03.820
 All you have to do is be shameless enough to wrap up your dead plant and send it back,

00:14:03.820 --> 00:14:05.480
 and they will probably give you the refund.

00:14:05.480 --> 00:14:09.780
 The key thing to know there is they're not selling these things on, and this is why it's

00:14:09.780 --> 00:14:10.780
 a problem.

00:14:10.780 --> 00:14:14.480
 They don't flog a dead plant to some chump and convince them it's a rare species.

00:14:14.480 --> 00:14:17.820
 Because I think that's what happens when people send back their cloves or something.

00:14:17.820 --> 00:14:21.720
 They think, "Oh, they'll just put it back on the rack and whatever."

00:14:21.720 --> 00:14:26.200
 They never do that, and most people will order three sizes of the same thing and then keep

00:14:26.200 --> 00:14:28.200
 the one that fits and send the two others back.

00:14:28.200 --> 00:14:29.200
 Most people.

00:14:29.200 --> 00:14:31.360
 I mean, most people don't do that.

00:14:31.360 --> 00:14:32.360
 Don't worry.

00:14:32.360 --> 00:14:33.360
 Sorry.

00:14:33.360 --> 00:14:35.480
 Most people who have done the refunds.

00:14:35.480 --> 00:14:36.480
 My wife.

00:14:36.480 --> 00:14:37.480
 My wife.

00:14:37.480 --> 00:14:38.480
 That's what I'm trying to say.

00:14:38.480 --> 00:14:43.420
 So they'll send back the two that didn't fit, and then probably everyone assume, "Okay.

00:14:43.420 --> 00:14:45.420
 That just goes back on to ..." And it doesn't.

00:14:45.420 --> 00:14:47.260
 But when you think about it, it's an insane assumption to make.

00:14:47.260 --> 00:14:50.660
 Because I assume that if I send back this pair of socks, then it'll be returned and

00:14:50.660 --> 00:14:54.200
 it'll be somehow got back into the stream of new socks that are coming out of the sock

00:14:54.200 --> 00:14:55.200
 factory.

00:14:55.200 --> 00:14:58.660
 And it's actually very difficult to get a pair of socks into the new supply line of

00:14:58.660 --> 00:14:59.660
 socks.

00:14:59.660 --> 00:15:00.660
 And it's not worth it.

00:15:00.660 --> 00:15:03.260
 And you've got to get that weird plastic thing with the two little toggles on the end

00:15:03.260 --> 00:15:04.260
 through it again.

00:15:04.260 --> 00:15:07.420
 Well, I always include that in a separate envelope when I send it back, but still, I think it

00:15:07.420 --> 00:15:08.420
 doesn't do any good.

00:15:08.420 --> 00:15:13.080
 Are you only, like, by the pair of socks just to wear them once for sex, presumably, and

00:15:13.080 --> 00:15:14.880
 then send them back?

00:15:14.880 --> 00:15:17.680
 Yeah, but it's a once-yearly thing, so it doesn't matter.

00:15:17.680 --> 00:15:20.040
 It's a relatively low-impact thing.

00:15:20.040 --> 00:15:24.000
 But there was an amazing thing in the Atlantic about this whole system.

00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:28.360
 So when you return an item, what we see as customers is you see the label you print out,

00:15:28.360 --> 00:15:32.200
 you might hand it to a local shopkeeper and they post it off for you and you get the refund.

00:15:32.200 --> 00:15:38.120
 But beyond that, there's this mad system that kicks in of liquidators and recyclers and

00:15:38.120 --> 00:15:39.120
 resellers.

00:15:39.120 --> 00:15:42.780
 And they are shuffling it and, you know, sometimes they're reselling it.

00:15:42.780 --> 00:15:46.140
 And this is what the Atlantic says, "Deep within that system, in a processing facility

00:15:46.140 --> 00:15:51.180
 in the Lehigh Valley, a guy named Michael has to sniff your sweatpants."

00:15:51.180 --> 00:15:54.820
 Because they have these material, what they call material handlers who have to work out

00:15:54.820 --> 00:15:55.820
 what to do with it.

00:15:55.820 --> 00:15:56.820
 "Is this good to be sold on?

00:15:56.820 --> 00:15:57.820
 Is it fine?"

00:15:57.820 --> 00:16:00.260
 And so they'll look, they'll feel, they'll assess, and they'll take a big old sniff.

00:16:00.260 --> 00:16:02.620
 And they make them change their names, don't they, as part of the job.

00:16:02.620 --> 00:16:03.620
 It's all Michael.

00:16:03.620 --> 00:16:05.380
 It's Michael one, Michael two, Michael three.

00:16:05.380 --> 00:16:06.380
 Yeah.

00:16:06.380 --> 00:16:10.320
 And we should say, this is pretty much all online, is online, which has created this

00:16:10.320 --> 00:16:11.840
 enormous industry.

00:16:11.840 --> 00:16:17.940
 But like you said, it has, it was begun, the habit of letting people refund their clothes,

00:16:17.940 --> 00:16:21.440
 no questions asked, in the early 20th century.

00:16:21.440 --> 00:16:27.860
 And in fact, I think it was JC Penny stores, which are those big American department stores,

00:16:27.860 --> 00:16:32.560
 that was their innovation quite early on to basically say customers can bring anything

00:16:32.560 --> 00:16:33.560
 back.

00:16:33.560 --> 00:16:38.860
 Just to the extent that people would bring stuff in that was clearly from another shop,

00:16:38.860 --> 00:16:40.360
 and then they'd refund it there.

00:16:40.360 --> 00:16:43.720
 And I think Walmart said the same thing, Walmart took tips from them, we're like, "Yep, we'll

00:16:43.720 --> 00:16:44.720
 take it back."

00:16:44.720 --> 00:16:47.020
 They bring a pony back that they've got from the local state, just take it, give them a

00:16:47.020 --> 00:16:49.300
 refund, give them 10 grand, let them go on their merry way.

00:16:49.300 --> 00:16:50.300
 The customers always, right?

00:16:50.300 --> 00:16:53.720
 And I think the guy who founded Walmart worked at JC Penny, didn't he?

00:16:53.720 --> 00:16:54.720
 I think he did, yeah.

00:16:54.720 --> 00:16:59.660
 And JC Penny, billionaire, who created an industry, do you know what the C in JC Penny

00:16:59.660 --> 00:17:00.660
 stood for?

00:17:00.660 --> 00:17:01.660
 Christmas.

00:17:01.660 --> 00:17:02.660
 Oh, no.

00:17:02.660 --> 00:17:03.660
 Cash.

00:17:03.660 --> 00:17:04.660
 Cash.

00:17:04.660 --> 00:17:05.660
 Cash Penny.

00:17:05.660 --> 00:17:06.660
 Cash Penny.

00:17:06.660 --> 00:17:07.660
 It's Cash Penny.

00:17:07.660 --> 00:17:08.660
 No.

00:17:08.660 --> 00:17:11.680
 Like the rich English family called Money Coots, which is Coots is the bank, it's, yeah, Cash

00:17:11.680 --> 00:17:12.680
 Penny.

00:17:12.680 --> 00:17:15.300
 I wish I could tell you what the J was, and I forgot to Google it.

00:17:15.300 --> 00:17:16.300
 It's James.

00:17:16.300 --> 00:17:17.800
 James Cash Penny.

00:17:17.800 --> 00:17:18.800
 Yeah.

00:17:18.800 --> 00:17:21.800
 All very rich words.

00:17:21.800 --> 00:17:29.520
 Do you know the practice of buying an item once and then returning it for refund deliberately?

00:17:29.520 --> 00:17:33.440
 You buy it for a party, you wear it, you send it back pretending it didn't fit.

00:17:33.440 --> 00:17:37.020
 It's called Wardrobe-ing, and all the companies refer to this.

00:17:37.020 --> 00:17:40.280
 If you read it on their websites, they'll be chatting to each other on the forums.

00:17:40.280 --> 00:17:42.800
 Oh, Wardrobe-ing is such an issue in our industry.

00:17:42.800 --> 00:17:44.200
 So stop Wardrobe-ing.

00:17:44.200 --> 00:17:48.520
 It's so funny watching, because I'm in the queues, as I say, there needs to be a separate

00:17:48.520 --> 00:17:49.520
 line.

00:17:49.520 --> 00:17:50.520
 I'm behind the...

00:17:50.520 --> 00:17:51.520
 Behind your wife?

00:17:51.520 --> 00:17:52.520
 I'm behind my wife.

00:17:52.520 --> 00:17:57.060
 No, you're behind these extraordinarily hungover people who clearly have been partying all

00:17:57.060 --> 00:18:00.960
 night, and they're like, "It didn't fit.

00:18:00.960 --> 00:18:01.960
 I need to return it."

00:18:01.960 --> 00:18:06.240
 You're like, "Dude, you literally are still drunk, and you're handing this back.

00:18:06.240 --> 00:18:07.240
 Yeah, it's wild."

00:18:07.240 --> 00:18:08.240
 It does happen.

00:18:08.240 --> 00:18:09.400
 They're not just with clothes, of course.

00:18:09.400 --> 00:18:11.920
 You get refunds with all sorts of things these days.

00:18:11.920 --> 00:18:16.920
 On delivery services, like food delivery services, you can sometimes get a refund if there's

00:18:16.920 --> 00:18:21.240
 a problem with your meal, and these days, they're getting to a stage where they'll just often

00:18:21.240 --> 00:18:24.440
 give you the refund without that much evidence.

00:18:24.440 --> 00:18:29.860
 So there was a guy who got refunded his just eat order because he complained his ice cream

00:18:29.860 --> 00:18:30.860
 was cold.

00:18:30.860 --> 00:18:35.180
 It's like, "I'm going to want a refund."

00:18:35.180 --> 00:18:37.220
 It puts in, "What's your reason?"

00:18:37.220 --> 00:18:40.500
 He just made it up, made up a reason, and they just gave him the refund.

00:18:40.500 --> 00:18:43.620
 And then the retailer's the one who loses out.

00:18:43.620 --> 00:18:47.060
 Sometimes it does hurt your teeth.

00:18:47.060 --> 00:18:48.060
 Yeah.

00:18:48.060 --> 00:18:49.060
 It's too much.

00:18:49.060 --> 00:18:53.220
 There was also an exchange on Twitter that I saw where there was a customer who said,

00:18:53.220 --> 00:19:00.560
 "Hello, I ordered a dozen custom masks from you, however you only sent me 12."

00:19:00.560 --> 00:19:04.080
 It was a baker, though, wasn't it?

00:19:04.080 --> 00:19:08.040
 There was, I read a lady who tried to get a refund off a holiday that she went on to

00:19:08.040 --> 00:19:09.040
 Spain.

00:19:09.040 --> 00:19:11.920
 She went to this hotel, and afterwards she wrote a complaint saying, "I want my money

00:19:11.920 --> 00:19:12.920
 back."

00:19:12.920 --> 00:19:13.920
 And they said, "Why?"

00:19:13.920 --> 00:19:17.360
 And she said, "There were too many Spanish people in the hotel."

00:19:17.360 --> 00:19:20.320
 And she was like, "Shouldn't they be on holiday somewhere else?

00:19:20.320 --> 00:19:23.340
 What are they doing in my Spanish holiday?"

00:19:23.340 --> 00:19:25.620
 And they refused, obviously.

00:19:25.620 --> 00:19:29.500
 So we assume she's very xenophobic, but it could be she's just objected to the logic

00:19:29.500 --> 00:19:32.900
 of the fact that if you're going on holiday, surely it's not your own country.

00:19:32.900 --> 00:19:38.980
 I was looking at just sort of general returning gifts or refusing gifts as a way of looking

00:19:38.980 --> 00:19:39.980
 at this one.

00:19:39.980 --> 00:19:44.980
 So President Abraham Lincoln, he was offered some gifts in 1861 by the king of Siam who

00:19:44.980 --> 00:19:47.860
 said, "I would like to send you some elephants.

00:19:47.860 --> 00:19:49.080
 All you have to do is release them.

00:19:49.080 --> 00:19:51.920
 They will multiply across America.

00:19:51.920 --> 00:19:55.040
 If you give us a big ship and fill it with hay and water, we'll send loads of elephants

00:19:55.040 --> 00:19:56.040
 across to you.

00:19:56.040 --> 00:19:58.520
 And just let them loose and you'll have loads of, you know, within a century America will

00:19:58.520 --> 00:20:02.480
 be overrun with elephants and that'll be a really good thing for transportation purposes."

00:20:02.480 --> 00:20:03.480
 Right.

00:20:03.480 --> 00:20:06.560
 Well, there are elephants in America now, so did he just say no or...?

00:20:06.560 --> 00:20:12.320
 He wrote back with the most diplomatic answer, like it sets a good standard for American presidents

00:20:12.320 --> 00:20:13.320
 in terms of diplomacy.

00:20:13.320 --> 00:20:17.720
 He wrote back saying, "Certainly America does not reach a latitude so low as to favour

00:20:17.720 --> 00:20:19.340
 the multiplication of the elephants."

00:20:19.340 --> 00:20:20.340
 Really?

00:20:20.340 --> 00:20:21.340
 But thank you so much anyway.

00:20:21.340 --> 00:20:24.660
 It was just a very subtle nice way.

00:20:24.660 --> 00:20:27.420
 Everyone always sent a letter in advance warning you what the present was they were going

00:20:27.420 --> 00:20:28.420
 to get you.

00:20:28.420 --> 00:20:29.900
 So you can send them for light rejection.

00:20:29.900 --> 00:20:34.860
 There was a guy in India who wanted a refund for a train ticket.

00:20:34.860 --> 00:20:41.700
 He'd been overcharged for a train ticket by 20 rupees, which was 25 cents, US cents.

00:20:41.700 --> 00:20:46.900
 And after 100 hearings, eventually he got his 20 rupees back.

00:20:46.900 --> 00:20:50.320
 Apparently his family tried to convince him that it was all pointless and a waste of time

00:20:50.320 --> 00:20:54.760
 and money, but he says it's not the money that matters.

00:20:54.760 --> 00:20:57.840
 This is a fight for justice and a fight against corruption.

00:20:57.840 --> 00:21:03.400
 That's the shittest Batman ever.

00:21:03.400 --> 00:21:09.440
 In fairness, the rail company was fined about US$200, which he got as well, so he got some

00:21:09.440 --> 00:21:10.440
 money out of it.

00:21:10.440 --> 00:21:13.800
 But that still didn't play for the massive divorce proceedings that followed.

00:21:13.800 --> 00:21:18.860
 22 years of trying to get his 20 rupees back.

00:21:18.860 --> 00:21:21.660
 Customers complaining goes back a long way.

00:21:21.660 --> 00:21:22.660
 It's so exciting.

00:21:22.660 --> 00:21:25.420
 This is something that I think we've probably been aware of, but we've never mentioned on

00:21:25.420 --> 00:21:33.260
 the podcast that there's a demand for a refund that is on a clay tablet from 1750 BC.

00:21:33.260 --> 00:21:34.620
 It's one of the oldest ones we have.

00:21:34.620 --> 00:21:42.340
 It's a Mesopotamia, and it's so good because it's exactly like a TripAdvisor complaint today.

00:21:42.340 --> 00:21:47.840
 And it's a complaint to someone called Aya Naseer from a customer who's called Nani,

00:21:47.840 --> 00:21:52.500
 and Nani has sent his servant to buy some copper ingots on his behalf.

00:21:52.500 --> 00:21:56.400
 And he considered the ingots substandard, and the complaint is just an explanation of

00:21:56.400 --> 00:21:58.960
 how these ingots are very poor standard of ingots.

00:21:58.960 --> 00:22:03.800
 But not only that, the servant was treated very poorly by the salesperson when he tried

00:22:03.800 --> 00:22:04.800
 to buy them.

00:22:04.800 --> 00:22:08.600
 He'd been dreadfully rude to them, so apparently the salesperson has said, "Well, if you want

00:22:08.600 --> 00:22:09.600
 to take them, take them.

00:22:09.600 --> 00:22:11.360
 If you don't want to take them, don't."

00:22:11.360 --> 00:22:12.360
 And it was great.

00:22:12.360 --> 00:22:14.820
 And then saying, "You know, you must restore my money to me in full.

00:22:14.820 --> 00:22:15.900
 This isn't good enough."

00:22:15.900 --> 00:22:17.660
 And that's 4,000 years ago.

00:22:17.660 --> 00:22:27.780
 4,000 years we've been whinging.

00:22:27.780 --> 00:22:32.980
 It is time for us to move on to fact number three, and that is Andy.

00:22:32.980 --> 00:22:39.220
 My fact is there is a man in America who has tasted 500 kinds of banana and claims he has

00:22:39.220 --> 00:22:41.800
 special banana eyes.

00:22:41.800 --> 00:22:43.800
 He's called Gabriel Sachter-Smith.

00:22:43.800 --> 00:22:47.120
 He lives in Hawaii, and he was recently profiled in the New York Times, which is how I found

00:22:47.120 --> 00:22:48.120
 out about him.

00:22:48.120 --> 00:22:49.120
 He is a banana fan.

00:22:49.120 --> 00:22:50.120
 He's a banana farmer.

00:22:50.120 --> 00:22:51.360
 He's a big banana boy.

00:22:51.360 --> 00:22:55.920
 He just loves bananas, basically, and he hunts bananas around the world.

00:22:55.920 --> 00:22:56.920
 He hunts the rare bananas.

00:22:56.920 --> 00:22:57.920
 They're easy to catch, aren't they?

00:22:57.920 --> 00:22:58.920
 They're slow-moving.

00:22:58.920 --> 00:23:01.880
 But you've got to know what you're looking for.

00:23:01.880 --> 00:23:05.280
 You've got a spot and say, "I've never seen you before."

00:23:05.280 --> 00:23:09.160
 And so he grows 150 different varieties on his own.

00:23:09.160 --> 00:23:10.500
 He hunts new varieties.

00:23:10.500 --> 00:23:12.500
 I see you, like, special, weird-looking.

00:23:12.500 --> 00:23:16.500
 Like, rare ones that, you know, we've got one biggie, the Cavendish, that's the global

00:23:16.500 --> 00:23:17.500
 banana these days.

00:23:17.500 --> 00:23:19.780
 He's looking for the rare, the deep cuts.

00:23:19.780 --> 00:23:22.380
 And a lot of them don't look like a banana.

00:23:22.380 --> 00:23:23.900
 So some of them are egg-shaped.

00:23:23.900 --> 00:23:27.840
 Some of them are like, it's kind of like with potatoes as well.

00:23:27.840 --> 00:23:31.060
 Like, there are potato hunters that go out there, and they go, "This is a potato.

00:23:31.060 --> 00:23:33.700
 It looks nothing like a potato."

00:23:33.700 --> 00:23:34.700
 It doesn't look nothing.

00:23:34.700 --> 00:23:36.580
 It doesn't look like a dinosaur, does it?

00:23:36.580 --> 00:23:40.880
 Yeah, no, but it does look like a tree, for example, like it just doesn't look like what

00:23:40.880 --> 00:23:41.880
 it is.

00:23:41.880 --> 00:23:42.880
 And it's the same with this.

00:23:42.880 --> 00:23:44.680
 So apparently this is what his brilliant skill is.

00:23:44.680 --> 00:23:49.640
 Wherever he is, he can just say, "Banana," and people go, "That's a postbox."

00:23:49.640 --> 00:23:50.640
 And they'll say, "No."

00:23:50.640 --> 00:23:52.280
 I'll tell you, that's my wife.

00:23:52.280 --> 00:23:53.280
 It's a banana.

00:23:53.280 --> 00:23:57.520
 That's what his banana eyes are, that eyes that can spot a new variety of banana.

00:23:57.520 --> 00:23:58.520
 Yeah.

00:23:58.520 --> 00:24:02.880
 He tracks them down, and he has people guiding him as well who might know special local cultivars

00:24:02.880 --> 00:24:03.880
 of banana.

00:24:03.880 --> 00:24:10.740
 So he's one of the world experts on it, and it's really useful because scientists have

00:24:10.740 --> 00:24:16.140
 a secret supply of support bananas, just in case something happens to the Cavendish,

00:24:16.140 --> 00:24:17.140
 which is our big variety.

00:24:17.140 --> 00:24:18.140
 A support?

00:24:18.140 --> 00:24:23.320
 Is that like a banana you bring on an aeroplane if you're slightly emotionally vulnerable?

00:24:23.320 --> 00:24:28.460
 He's sent 200 new bananas to a gene bank in Belgium, and they're cryo-preserved at minus

00:24:28.460 --> 00:24:29.460
 200 degrees.

00:24:29.460 --> 00:24:33.060
 They're like Hans Solo, just waiting to be thawed out in case of diet emergency.

00:24:33.060 --> 00:24:35.840
 But they're all like the Cavendish are just really tasty, right?

00:24:35.840 --> 00:24:38.800
 And the other ones are just all rubbish, like little brown things.

00:24:38.800 --> 00:24:42.000
 Cavendish would be bred to be very tasty, haven't they?

00:24:42.000 --> 00:24:47.040
 But they might be vulnerable to disease, although scientists are always working on reinforcing

00:24:47.040 --> 00:24:49.680
 the Cavendish to make sure that that can last as the banana.

00:24:49.680 --> 00:24:53.280
 So there's no imminent peril, I think.

00:24:53.280 --> 00:24:58.960
 I think I read there's 1,600 different varieties of banana in this vault that are like Austin

00:24:58.960 --> 00:24:59.960
 Powers.

00:24:59.960 --> 00:25:04.380
 They're sitting there waiting to wake up in a future that they won't understand, and

00:25:04.380 --> 00:25:07.260
 we'll say "cancelable things".

00:25:07.260 --> 00:25:11.620
 But it is amazing, like the science that is going on.

00:25:11.620 --> 00:25:13.580
 You think bananas are just in the wild?

00:25:13.580 --> 00:25:17.580
 No, we've got people protecting the banana at a huge scientific base.

00:25:17.580 --> 00:25:21.660
 Yeah, a lot is going into it, because it is a risk just because Cavendish are clones,

00:25:21.660 --> 00:25:25.060
 so they may not have anything threatening them now, but as soon as the threat comes,

00:25:25.060 --> 00:25:26.060
 they're all done.

00:25:26.060 --> 00:25:29.600
 And yeah, I love banana heroes who are really into it.

00:25:29.600 --> 00:25:33.340
 Do you know who eats the most bananas in the world?

00:25:33.340 --> 00:25:36.040
 What nationality-wise, or individual-wise?

00:25:36.040 --> 00:25:38.680
 Yeah, the answer is monkeys.

00:25:38.680 --> 00:25:40.680
 No, which country?

00:25:40.680 --> 00:25:41.680
 Which country?

00:25:41.680 --> 00:25:45.360
 I mean, I'll be honest, you're not going to guess this in a million years.

00:25:45.360 --> 00:25:46.360
 Really?

00:25:46.360 --> 00:25:47.360
 Equatorial Guinea.

00:25:47.360 --> 00:25:48.360
 Is it per capita?

00:25:48.360 --> 00:25:49.360
 Oh, wouldn't it have been good?

00:25:49.360 --> 00:25:50.360
 That would have been amazing.

00:25:50.360 --> 00:25:51.360
 It was worth a try, wasn't it?

00:25:51.360 --> 00:25:52.360
 I wouldn't say it was confidence.

00:25:52.360 --> 00:25:53.960
 This is per capita, yeah.

00:25:53.960 --> 00:25:54.960
 Australia?

00:25:54.960 --> 00:26:01.860
 Australia eats around one a week, one every five days, an average Australian would eat.

00:26:01.860 --> 00:26:02.860
 Okay.

00:26:02.860 --> 00:26:05.960
 Okay, and this is, can you tell us how much these people eat before we find out who they

00:26:05.960 --> 00:26:06.960
 are?

00:26:06.960 --> 00:26:07.960
 Yeah, ten a day.

00:26:07.960 --> 00:26:08.960
 Get out.

00:26:08.960 --> 00:26:09.960
 Eat?

00:26:09.960 --> 00:26:10.960
 It's just not true.

00:26:10.960 --> 00:26:11.960
 It's so true.

00:26:11.960 --> 00:26:12.960
 People, oh, the Vatican.

00:26:12.960 --> 00:26:13.960
 The Vatican is a huge...

00:26:13.960 --> 00:26:14.960
 The Pope.

00:26:14.960 --> 00:26:21.560
 There's no end to that, just they love, they need the energy for the services, and you know...

00:26:21.560 --> 00:26:23.680
 What is the Pope doing with those bananas?

00:26:23.680 --> 00:26:24.680
 Yeah.

00:26:24.680 --> 00:26:28.640
 Well, it's a normal sized country, but you're not going to guess it, but you weren't a

00:26:28.640 --> 00:26:30.800
 million miles away with Equatorial Guinea.

00:26:30.800 --> 00:26:31.800
 It's Uganda.

00:26:31.800 --> 00:26:32.800
 Uganda, yeah.

00:26:32.800 --> 00:26:39.080
 Uganda eats 660 pounds of bananas each year, which is about 3,000 per year on average per

00:26:39.080 --> 00:26:40.080
 person.

00:26:40.080 --> 00:26:43.940
 But the reason is because Ugandan food is basically banana-based.

00:26:43.940 --> 00:26:47.440
 So you have banana bread, you have banana...

00:26:47.440 --> 00:26:51.400
 The most common banana dish, matoke, is also the word for food in Uganda.

00:26:51.400 --> 00:26:52.400
 Oh.

00:26:52.400 --> 00:26:53.760
 You have Uganda beer.

00:26:53.760 --> 00:26:54.760
 You have...

00:26:54.760 --> 00:26:55.760
 You have...

00:26:55.760 --> 00:26:56.760
 Banana beer.

00:26:56.760 --> 00:26:57.760
 Banana beer.

00:26:57.760 --> 00:26:58.760
 I think I've had one too.

00:26:58.760 --> 00:26:59.760
 Many banana beers, maybe.

00:26:59.760 --> 00:27:01.920
 It's almost a problem, isn't it?

00:27:01.920 --> 00:27:04.960
 It makes up about 35% of the Ugandan diet.

00:27:04.960 --> 00:27:11.840
 I think Uganda and Congo are the top two of these matukae bananas, which are cooking bananas.

00:27:11.840 --> 00:27:16.000
 So more like plantain, I guess, but it's a bit of an issue.

00:27:16.000 --> 00:27:17.000
 People get deficiencies.

00:27:17.000 --> 00:27:20.360
 So there's a lot of vitamin A deficiency problems, because so much of their diet is

00:27:20.360 --> 00:27:22.000
 based on bananas that doesn't have enough.

00:27:22.000 --> 00:27:27.600
 So they've now made a super banana specifically for Uganda, which is a banana that has 30

00:27:27.600 --> 00:27:33.840
 times as much vitamin A as the normal banana, and could solve a lot of their problems, which

00:27:33.840 --> 00:27:34.840
 is very cool.

00:27:34.840 --> 00:27:35.840
 But people don't want to eat it.

00:27:35.840 --> 00:27:37.920
 There's suspicion, because it's a little bit orange.

00:27:37.920 --> 00:27:42.520
 So sellers are saying people are coming to us saying, "We just want the natural banana.

00:27:42.520 --> 00:27:43.880
 This banana's gone orange.

00:27:43.880 --> 00:27:44.880
 What's wrong with it?"

00:27:44.880 --> 00:27:45.880
 Yeah.

00:27:45.880 --> 00:27:46.880
 Well, it feels like you could just paint it.

00:27:46.880 --> 00:27:49.720
 I think that might take away some of the nutritional value.

00:27:49.720 --> 00:27:50.720
 Well, it doesn't.

00:27:50.720 --> 00:27:51.720
 It's on the skin.

00:27:51.720 --> 00:27:52.720
 You take it off.

00:27:52.720 --> 00:27:53.720
 You take the skin off.

00:27:53.720 --> 00:27:54.720
 No, no.

00:27:54.720 --> 00:27:55.720
 Sorry.

00:27:55.720 --> 00:27:56.720
 It's the flesh.

00:27:56.720 --> 00:27:57.720
 The flesh is orange.

00:27:57.720 --> 00:27:58.720
 Yeah, sorry.

00:27:58.720 --> 00:27:59.720
 Do you want to hear about the Highland Giant Banana?

00:27:59.720 --> 00:28:00.720
 Yes, please.

00:28:00.720 --> 00:28:02.640
 Is it a real or is it like a cryptid?

00:28:02.640 --> 00:28:03.640
 It's real.

00:28:03.640 --> 00:28:04.640
 Oh.

00:28:04.640 --> 00:28:05.640
 It's the biggest banana on the planet.

00:28:05.640 --> 00:28:07.720
 I wish it was a cryptid, though, because I'd love that.

00:28:07.720 --> 00:28:08.960
 I believe in that monster.

00:28:08.960 --> 00:28:09.960
 Well, you decide.

00:28:09.960 --> 00:28:12.120
 I'll tell you about it, and you decide if it's real or not.

00:28:12.120 --> 00:28:15.080
 So it's called Musa Ingans, is the scientific name.

00:28:15.080 --> 00:28:20.680
 It's the biggest non-woody plant on the planet, because it's not woody bananas or herbs, they're

00:28:20.680 --> 00:28:21.680
 not trees.

00:28:21.680 --> 00:28:22.680
 Yeah.

00:28:22.680 --> 00:28:28.520
 But it's 45 feet tall, and because it's not wood, it gets knocked over by the wind very

00:28:28.520 --> 00:28:29.520
 easily.

00:28:29.520 --> 00:28:32.800
 So it only grows in very deep jungle canyons in Papua New Guinea.

00:28:32.800 --> 00:28:33.800
 Cool.

00:28:33.800 --> 00:28:34.800
 Yeah.

00:28:34.800 --> 00:28:35.800
 And the fruit are very big.

00:28:35.800 --> 00:28:36.800
 Wow.

00:28:36.800 --> 00:28:40.400
 I bet the Pope fucking loves them.

00:28:40.400 --> 00:28:45.040
 I didn't write down a measurement for the fruit.

00:28:45.040 --> 00:28:46.040
 What was I thinking?

00:28:46.040 --> 00:28:49.560
 I just thought I'd cover it at the end by saying, "And they're very big."

00:28:49.560 --> 00:28:52.480
 I've seen photos of them, and they are massive.

00:28:52.480 --> 00:28:54.440
 Because we've all seen big trees, Andy.

00:28:54.440 --> 00:28:55.440
 It's a big banana.

00:28:55.440 --> 00:28:56.440
 They're little people.

00:28:56.440 --> 00:28:57.440
 No, this big.

00:28:57.440 --> 00:28:58.440
 Whoa.

00:28:58.440 --> 00:29:02.960
 He's gone for almost the length of a human arm, I would say, the teenager's arm.

00:29:02.960 --> 00:29:04.600
 Size of a chihuahua, I would say.

00:29:04.600 --> 00:29:07.760
 Size of a very, like, overfed chihuahua, I tell you.

00:29:07.760 --> 00:29:08.760
 Yeah.

00:29:08.760 --> 00:29:09.760
 Yeah.

00:29:09.760 --> 00:29:10.760
 Because they're fat.

00:29:10.760 --> 00:29:13.160
 Hey, one interesting thing about the fact that bananas are herbs, right, is they don't

00:29:13.160 --> 00:29:15.960
 have a trunk like a normal tree would do.

00:29:15.960 --> 00:29:18.280
 They have, they're not a woody stem.

00:29:18.280 --> 00:29:22.600
 And so when you see a banana tree, you'll see, like, at the top, the leaves are all

00:29:22.600 --> 00:29:25.880
 kind of shredded, like it's been in a hurricane.

00:29:25.880 --> 00:29:28.640
 But that's to help it if it's ever in a hurricane.

00:29:28.640 --> 00:29:33.600
 Because when the wind blows it, because they don't have the wooden stems, the kind of,

00:29:33.600 --> 00:29:35.640
 they might blow over quite easily.

00:29:35.640 --> 00:29:39.040
 And because they've got these kind of tattered leaves, it means that the wind can get right

00:29:39.040 --> 00:29:40.040
 through them.

00:29:40.040 --> 00:29:41.040
 That's pretty clever.

00:29:41.040 --> 00:29:42.040
 That's cool, isn't it?

00:29:42.040 --> 00:29:43.040
 That's so good.

00:29:43.040 --> 00:29:48.400
 And Britain is another nation that loves bananas, currently and historically.

00:29:48.400 --> 00:29:53.080
 So Britain bananas in Jamaica have a very intertwined history.

00:29:53.080 --> 00:29:58.440
 It was a huge export from Jamaica to Britain around the turn of the 20th century.

00:29:58.440 --> 00:30:03.840
 And in World War II, Britain had to suddenly requisition all of its, or a lot of its trade

00:30:03.840 --> 00:30:06.000
 ships to be used in the military.

00:30:06.000 --> 00:30:10.240
 So that included the ships that were bringing bananas from Jamaica to the UK.

00:30:10.240 --> 00:30:12.420
 But that was going to screw Jamaica's economy.

00:30:12.420 --> 00:30:16.800
 So basically, Jamaica kept on churning out loads and loads of bananas for Britain, put

00:30:16.800 --> 00:30:20.320
 them on a ship, and then immediately just tipped them all into the ocean.

00:30:20.320 --> 00:30:21.320
 What?

00:30:21.320 --> 00:30:22.520
 The ocean was just full of bananas.

00:30:22.520 --> 00:30:26.720
 If you went for a swim off the beaches of Jamaica in World War II, it was just bananas

00:30:26.720 --> 00:30:27.720
 layering.

00:30:27.720 --> 00:30:28.720
 And that's how the banana boat was invented.

00:30:28.720 --> 00:30:31.000
 And that's what it is, yes.

00:30:31.000 --> 00:30:32.000
 Yeah.

00:30:32.000 --> 00:30:33.000
 Honestly, that's amazing.

00:30:33.000 --> 00:30:34.000
 It's so cool.

00:30:34.000 --> 00:30:36.280
 And they were, of course, they were rationed in Britain, well, you couldn't get

00:30:36.280 --> 00:30:38.480
 them in Britain because they weren't being imported.

00:30:38.480 --> 00:30:41.800
 And there was this panic that Brits would have lost their taste for bananas because the whole

00:30:41.800 --> 00:30:47.100
 generation grew up without, and rationing famously, went on in Britain until about 1950.

00:30:47.100 --> 00:30:51.940
 So when the ban was lifted, the first shipment of bananas arrived into Liverpool, actually

00:30:51.940 --> 00:30:55.820
 from Sierra Leone, they arrived and the bananas were overripe.

00:30:55.820 --> 00:30:59.220
 They didn't want to throw them away because, you know, that's a waste, and what do you

00:30:59.220 --> 00:31:00.220
 do with them?

00:31:00.220 --> 00:31:01.220
 Big banana bread.

00:31:01.220 --> 00:31:03.820
 So they said, oh, they should have done a big loaf.

00:31:03.820 --> 00:31:04.820
 They didn't.

00:31:04.820 --> 00:31:07.340
 They just got all the dot workers, and they said, can you eat as many of these as you

00:31:07.340 --> 00:31:08.340
 can?

00:31:08.340 --> 00:31:09.340
 Oh, really?

00:31:09.340 --> 00:31:10.340
 So they went through 37,000.

00:31:10.340 --> 00:31:13.340
 They ate 12 bananas each.

00:31:13.340 --> 00:31:14.340
 Call the Vatican.

00:31:14.340 --> 00:31:17.340
 We have a banana emergency.

00:31:17.340 --> 00:31:18.340
 Okay.

00:31:18.340 --> 00:31:19.340
 Yellow.

00:31:19.340 --> 00:31:25.040
 So the Ecuadorian banana is a little too big for Britain.

00:31:25.040 --> 00:31:26.040
 Oh.

00:31:26.040 --> 00:31:27.040
 So I read a really interesting interview.

00:31:27.040 --> 00:31:28.040
 What does that mean?

00:31:28.040 --> 00:31:30.540
 Well, I would read a great interview with the managing director of Fife's in the UK.

00:31:30.540 --> 00:31:34.420
 They're a great big banana company, and he's called John Hawkins, and he said, the Ecuadorian

00:31:34.420 --> 00:31:37.000
 banana is a bit too big for the UK market.

00:31:37.000 --> 00:31:40.520
 It's only a couple of centimetres that it's too big, but it's enough for the housewife

00:31:40.520 --> 00:31:43.540
 to say it's more than a meal.

00:31:43.540 --> 00:31:47.660
 Whereas he says, I'm not trying to put any emphasis on any of this, but he says the German

00:31:47.660 --> 00:31:51.060
 housefraut loves the length of an Ecuadorian banana.

00:31:51.060 --> 00:31:54.620
 Well, she needs to take due after all those broken penises.

00:31:54.620 --> 00:31:58.900
 I'm going to have to move this on and say, guys.

00:31:58.900 --> 00:32:03.500
 You don't want to hear about the ratio shifting ratio between British banana and turlip consumption.

00:32:03.500 --> 00:32:08.960
 Screw this time frame, we've said ourselves.

00:32:08.960 --> 00:32:09.960
 Go Andy, go.

00:32:09.960 --> 00:32:10.960
 Fly my friend.

00:32:10.960 --> 00:32:11.960
 Fly my beauty.

00:32:11.960 --> 00:32:19.840
 Listen, better be good.

00:32:19.840 --> 00:32:32.080
 It's just that in the 1970s, the average British adult ate 84 grams of bananas each week and

00:32:32.080 --> 00:32:34.180
 40 grams of turlip.

00:32:34.180 --> 00:32:41.780
 But now we, well, steady, steady, that's just the set up.

00:32:41.780 --> 00:32:49.620
 Now we eat 200 grams of banana each week and just 12 grams of turlip.

00:32:49.620 --> 00:33:00.700
 It's so sad.

00:33:00.700 --> 00:33:02.960
 And it's time for our final fact of the show.

00:33:02.960 --> 00:33:04.480
 And that is James.

00:33:04.480 --> 00:33:05.480
 Okay.

00:33:05.480 --> 00:33:11.240
 My fact this week is that neo toddlerism is the idea that you can change the world by

00:33:11.240 --> 00:33:14.780
 acting like a three year old.

00:33:14.780 --> 00:33:15.780
 Okay.

00:33:15.780 --> 00:33:24.760
 And I must admit, I did come up with this fact before the recent events in America.

00:33:24.760 --> 00:33:25.760
 What's happened?

00:33:25.760 --> 00:33:27.320
 I've not seen the news.

00:33:27.320 --> 00:33:28.960
 Don't worry about it, Dan.

00:33:28.960 --> 00:33:33.940
 So this comes from an article by a blogger called Govinda Bogle.

00:33:33.940 --> 00:33:36.300
 It seems like he came up with the idea.

00:33:36.300 --> 00:33:41.040
 He is, he writes about psychology and the modern world and stuff like that.

00:33:41.040 --> 00:33:46.420
 And he came up with the idea that it's like, you know, you get people who are throwing

00:33:46.420 --> 00:33:53.180
 super paintings or going to the Republican convention dressed as babies.

00:33:53.180 --> 00:33:57.860
 And they reckon basically you're trying to, you're having to do these stunts because

00:33:57.860 --> 00:34:00.600
 of the world of tick tock and the world of social media.

00:34:00.600 --> 00:34:03.160
 And you're just trying to get a reaction just like a toddler would.

00:34:03.160 --> 00:34:07.200
 You're just trying to get people to look at you, get people to see what you're doing.

00:34:07.200 --> 00:34:08.200
 And that is the way to.

00:34:08.200 --> 00:34:09.200
 I see.

00:34:09.200 --> 00:34:10.200
 So it's about protest, basically.

00:34:10.200 --> 00:34:11.200
 It's about protest.

00:34:11.200 --> 00:34:14.160
 Not about people who are in charge acting like toddlers themselves.

00:34:14.160 --> 00:34:19.040
 No, it's not so much that it's the, it's the modern way of protesting in order to defeat

00:34:19.040 --> 00:34:21.520
 toddlers is by using other toddlers, right?

00:34:21.520 --> 00:34:23.680
 So maybe it's the best way to protest.

00:34:23.680 --> 00:34:24.680
 Is that how you do it?

00:34:24.680 --> 00:34:25.760
 Like a war of toddlers?

00:34:25.760 --> 00:34:26.760
 Yes.

00:34:26.760 --> 00:34:27.760
 Fire is fire.

00:34:27.760 --> 00:34:28.760
 The toddler is his toddlers.

00:34:28.760 --> 00:34:32.620
 Whenever my child misbehaves, I bring in the village terror child.

00:34:32.620 --> 00:34:39.240
 But I hear about all these different theories and I just like the idea of neo-toddlerism

00:34:39.240 --> 00:34:41.620
 and I just like the idea of acting like a toddler.

00:34:41.620 --> 00:34:43.740
 You just want us all to do it protest still or not?

00:34:43.740 --> 00:34:45.260
 I just like having naps.

00:34:45.260 --> 00:34:46.260
 Yeah.

00:34:46.260 --> 00:34:47.260
 Okay.

00:34:47.260 --> 00:34:50.700
 That no one's protested by just having a nap every afternoon for two hours yet.

00:34:50.700 --> 00:34:51.700
 But they could.

00:34:51.700 --> 00:34:52.700
 Yeah.

00:34:52.700 --> 00:34:53.700
 He's very critical of it.

00:34:53.700 --> 00:34:59.000
 And, you know, says that he uses some examples of protests that have been happening at the

00:34:59.000 --> 00:35:00.000
 moment.

00:35:00.000 --> 00:35:04.760
 You know, people in just up oil often through paint over paintings, ironically, to destroy

00:35:04.760 --> 00:35:05.760
 them.

00:35:05.760 --> 00:35:10.800
 And it's often soup over paintings, but they never throw a painting at a bowl of soup.

00:35:10.800 --> 00:35:12.840
 No, they're not trying to destroy soup.

00:35:12.840 --> 00:35:13.840
 Are they?

00:35:13.840 --> 00:35:14.840
 But I would be interested in that.

00:35:14.840 --> 00:35:17.040
 Like as a, just a, you know, cool variation on the thing.

00:35:17.040 --> 00:35:21.480
 The interesting thing that I read in no is they literally never even harm the paintings.

00:35:21.480 --> 00:35:23.860
 There's one painting which they very mildly harmed.

00:35:23.860 --> 00:35:26.300
 So I think it is quite interesting or the fuss about it.

00:35:26.300 --> 00:35:31.660
 But the other thing that this guy's point is that it's very impulsive and over-emotional

00:35:31.660 --> 00:35:36.420
 and not very thoughtful protest, but he uses an example, things like the release of worms

00:35:36.420 --> 00:35:40.160
 and maggots into Netanyahu's hotel room at the Watergate.

00:35:40.160 --> 00:35:42.140
 And that takes a huge amount of forward planning.

00:35:42.140 --> 00:35:43.140
 Yeah.

00:35:43.140 --> 00:35:46.740
 I wouldn't be able to, where are you sourcing a huge number of worms and maggots?

00:35:46.740 --> 00:35:50.500
 I was trying to look for worms recently and it takes ages even to find one.

00:35:50.500 --> 00:35:51.500
 You're in the ground, Anna.

00:35:51.500 --> 00:35:52.500
 Yeah.

00:35:52.500 --> 00:35:53.500
 Okay.

00:35:53.500 --> 00:35:55.000
 How much do you find enough to overwhelm a hotel room?

00:35:55.000 --> 00:35:59.560
 I don't think he opened the door and a wall of worms fell out on top of it.

00:35:59.560 --> 00:36:00.560
 And maggots.

00:36:00.560 --> 00:36:04.720
 There's a maximum happy number of worms in your hotel room, which is zero.

00:36:04.720 --> 00:36:07.300
 So any advance on that is technically a good process.

00:36:07.300 --> 00:36:08.300
 Yeah.

00:36:08.300 --> 00:36:09.300
 But it can't be just two, can it?

00:36:09.300 --> 00:36:11.320
 He's not going to walk in and go, "Waaaaaah!"

00:36:11.320 --> 00:36:12.320
 Yeah.

00:36:12.320 --> 00:36:15.200
 Well, as soon as he tries to cut them up to throw them away, he's got four worms.

00:36:15.200 --> 00:36:16.200
 So that's true.

00:36:16.200 --> 00:36:21.240
 Do you know, the idea that they're not forward planning is not strictly true.

00:36:21.240 --> 00:36:25.880
 So the very famous incident that happened in London not too long ago was Van Gogh's

00:36:25.880 --> 00:36:27.380
 Sunflowers.

00:36:27.380 --> 00:36:32.140
 Anna Holland and Phoebe Plummer, they came in and they threw tomato soup at it.

00:36:32.140 --> 00:36:35.340
 But they went in and they staked the joint.

00:36:35.340 --> 00:36:39.060
 They went a few days before and they brought in cans of tomato soup to see if that would

00:36:39.060 --> 00:36:40.700
 make it past security.

00:36:40.700 --> 00:36:44.860
 They went back to an Airbnb that they were staying in and they went into the showers

00:36:44.860 --> 00:36:50.320
 in there and had to work out at what angle do you throw tin soup at an item?

00:36:50.320 --> 00:36:51.320
 Really?

00:36:51.320 --> 00:36:52.320
 Yeah.

00:36:52.320 --> 00:36:53.720
 So they went in and they tried all the different things that you could do.

00:36:53.720 --> 00:36:58.160
 They had it all planned out to the point where there were journalists planted in there.

00:36:58.160 --> 00:36:59.520
 So that's how much forward thinking was.

00:36:59.520 --> 00:37:04.120
 They informed media who were waiting silently knowing that this was going to happen.

00:37:04.120 --> 00:37:07.720
 But there was a bunch of kids who were sitting and doing their own little sketches of it.

00:37:07.720 --> 00:37:12.840
 So they had to wait ages for these kids to do these drawings and eventually they moved

00:37:12.840 --> 00:37:16.300
 away and they threw the soup, it went on it.

00:37:16.300 --> 00:37:20.140
 They glued their hands to the wall and then they got arrested, right?

00:37:20.140 --> 00:37:22.380
 Now they thought that they were going to get off because they thought there was a good

00:37:22.380 --> 00:37:23.380
 point to it.

00:37:23.380 --> 00:37:25.740
 They have been found guilty and they are serving time.

00:37:25.740 --> 00:37:30.700
 And the thing that they got busted for is that the frame that was housing the Van Gogh

00:37:30.700 --> 00:37:34.580
 painting was incredibly old, 1700s.

00:37:34.580 --> 00:37:39.100
 It was incredibly expensive and the soup went on it and the acid burnt away a bunch of the

00:37:39.100 --> 00:37:40.100
 frames.

00:37:40.100 --> 00:37:41.100
 Yeah.

00:37:41.100 --> 00:37:43.300
 So do they put it in my Heinz tomato soup?

00:37:43.300 --> 00:37:48.060
 Sorry, when I spill a little bit of soup it doesn't burn through my table.

00:37:48.060 --> 00:37:49.460
 It's a good point.

00:37:49.460 --> 00:37:50.780
 It's an excellent point.

00:37:50.780 --> 00:37:53.500
 Do you know why just a pile use orange?

00:37:53.500 --> 00:37:56.140
 So they often do orange paint in their things.

00:37:56.140 --> 00:37:57.140
 Shows up well?

00:37:57.140 --> 00:37:58.220
 Shows up well, definitely.

00:37:58.220 --> 00:37:59.640
 In fact, I will come to that.

00:37:59.640 --> 00:38:04.500
 So they say it's a symbol of hope because it's a bright colour, all this.

00:38:04.500 --> 00:38:09.360
 But actually orange has been used in environmental protests for quite a long time and that is

00:38:09.360 --> 00:38:13.420
 because green and orange are clashing colours.

00:38:13.420 --> 00:38:17.700
 So green and red are complementary colours, they're exactly opposite on the colour wheel.

00:38:17.700 --> 00:38:22.500
 But if you just go one away from red, suddenly the colours really, really clash.

00:38:22.500 --> 00:38:27.220
 And so for ages and ages it's always been used in green protest because it looks very

00:38:27.220 --> 00:38:29.540
 artificial because it looks the opposite of green.

00:38:29.540 --> 00:38:32.660
 And did you deliberately wear a green and orange shirt tonight that everyone's been

00:38:32.660 --> 00:38:35.220
 having to look at for the last hour and a half already?

00:38:35.220 --> 00:38:36.860
 I'm done as well.

00:38:36.860 --> 00:38:37.860
 Jesus Christ.

00:38:37.860 --> 00:38:41.800
 Jesus Christ, you haven't seen Andy's underpants.

00:38:41.800 --> 00:38:43.800
 Thank God.

00:38:43.800 --> 00:38:47.840
 I was looking at protests, what works, what doesn't.

00:38:47.840 --> 00:38:51.560
 And there was this really interesting study that came out quite recently by a Harvard

00:38:51.560 --> 00:38:56.880
 academic called Erica Chenoweth who she found that nonviolent campaigns twice as likely

00:38:56.880 --> 00:39:00.760
 to achieve their goals as violent campaigns, which is quite useful and all these campaigns

00:39:00.760 --> 00:39:04.040
 that are being referred to, then it's not violent unless you count kind of drenching

00:39:04.040 --> 00:39:07.800
 something in a tasty liquid as violence.

00:39:07.800 --> 00:39:13.660
 And the really interesting revelation she had, and she looked at a lot of sort of successful

00:39:13.660 --> 00:39:18.460
 protests basically where they've stated their aim and then their aim has been achieved,

00:39:18.460 --> 00:39:23.900
 found that as soon as 3.5% of the population is actively involved in a movement, the success

00:39:23.900 --> 00:39:25.340
 rate is 100%.

00:39:25.340 --> 00:39:26.340
 Wow.

00:39:26.340 --> 00:39:27.340
 Wow.

00:39:27.340 --> 00:39:31.180
 And she looked at, I think it was over, it was a couple of hundred, I think, protests.

00:39:31.180 --> 00:39:34.820
 So in Australia, for instance, that's about a million people.

00:39:34.820 --> 00:39:39.280
 If you have a cause, if you're really popular, you can rope in a million people, 100% chance

00:39:39.280 --> 00:39:40.360
 it's going to work.

00:39:40.360 --> 00:39:44.280
 It's the same number of people who will go on a cruise ship holiday this year in Australia.

00:39:44.280 --> 00:39:45.800
 So if you've got all of them.

00:39:45.800 --> 00:39:52.580
 Just tell them you're not returning to shore until you sign the petition, yeah.

00:39:52.580 --> 00:39:57.040
 Some things that toddlers are good at, 10 pin bowling.

00:39:57.040 --> 00:39:58.040
 So the world's...

00:39:58.040 --> 00:39:59.040
 In what capacity?

00:39:59.040 --> 00:40:00.040
 Well.

00:40:00.040 --> 00:40:01.040
 Are they?

00:40:01.040 --> 00:40:06.380
 Possibly the world's best 10 pin bowler is an Aussie called Jason Belmontay from New

00:40:06.380 --> 00:40:07.740
 South Wales.

00:40:07.740 --> 00:40:16.240
 He's won 31 world titles and he bowls like a child because when he was a toddler, that's

00:40:16.240 --> 00:40:20.760
 when he learned he wasn't strong enough to lift up the ball with one hand and roll it.

00:40:20.760 --> 00:40:25.100
 So he used two hands and sort of rolled it that way and he carried it on his whole life

00:40:25.100 --> 00:40:26.860
 and now he's the best in the world.

00:40:26.860 --> 00:40:27.860
 Wow.

00:40:27.860 --> 00:40:28.860
 Get out.

00:40:28.860 --> 00:40:29.860
 It's plausible.

00:40:29.860 --> 00:40:32.480
 The number of times I've been bowling, are you not the same?

00:40:32.480 --> 00:40:37.520
 And you go for like a really graceful long hard bowl and it just tips one over and you

00:40:37.520 --> 00:40:41.400
 have the idiot who's never done it before who bumps it along and knocks them all down.

00:40:41.400 --> 00:40:44.680
 He's the only 30 time winner in PBA Tour history.

00:40:44.680 --> 00:40:47.080
 He does use those barriers.

00:40:47.080 --> 00:40:48.080
 What?

00:40:48.080 --> 00:40:49.080
 No, he doesn't.

00:40:49.080 --> 00:40:56.480
 I was so angry then.

00:40:56.480 --> 00:40:57.480
 It's allowed.

00:40:57.480 --> 00:40:59.300
 It's a little known rule of bowling.

00:40:59.300 --> 00:41:01.860
 They're not allowed to turn you down.

00:41:01.860 --> 00:41:05.220
 Can I tell you guys about my favorite protest that I've learned about?

00:41:05.220 --> 00:41:11.640
 So we all probably remember back in the day when the Beatles were sort of at their height,

00:41:11.640 --> 00:41:18.220
 1966, John Lennon made some comments where he said that we are bigger than Christ, right?

00:41:18.220 --> 00:41:23.380
 And this angered so many people to the point that the Beatles were being boycotted by radio

00:41:23.380 --> 00:41:24.380
 stations.

00:41:24.380 --> 00:41:27.760
 They were burning their stuff, burning all their records in all of John Lennon's books.

00:41:27.760 --> 00:41:33.760
 In particular, there was a radio station called Clue and Clue organized a bonfire.

00:41:33.760 --> 00:41:35.520
 So it had a thousand people there.

00:41:35.520 --> 00:41:36.960
 They all threw in their records.

00:41:36.960 --> 00:41:38.280
 It all burnt and so on.

00:41:38.280 --> 00:41:40.720
 That's a famous story that happened.

00:41:40.720 --> 00:41:42.560
 This next bit is less famous.

00:41:42.560 --> 00:41:49.480
 There is a theory that God agreed with John Lennon theory.

00:41:49.480 --> 00:41:51.640
 You're going to have to continue with that.

00:41:51.640 --> 00:41:54.500
 Otherwise you've just said nonsense.

00:41:54.500 --> 00:41:57.220
 So what happened is they did the bonfire, they burned all their stuff.

00:41:57.220 --> 00:42:01.820
 No, the next day, Clue's transmitter tower was struck by lightning.

00:42:01.820 --> 00:42:05.860
 All the equipment was knocked out completely and their news director, who's basically running

00:42:05.860 --> 00:42:11.500
 the whole thing, got hit, got knocked out and rushed to hospital and they didn't get back

00:42:11.500 --> 00:42:13.100
 on for another day or so.

00:42:13.100 --> 00:42:18.620
 So God was effectively going, "I love the Beatles."

00:42:18.620 --> 00:42:19.620
 It's a theory.

00:42:19.620 --> 00:42:22.320
 That's Old Testament God, isn't it?

00:42:22.320 --> 00:42:25.360
 It's a proper Old School God.

00:42:25.360 --> 00:42:26.480
 I say it's a popular theory.

00:42:26.480 --> 00:42:31.120
 I sort of invented it for this show, but I think it's got legs.

00:42:31.120 --> 00:42:35.360
 Just another 999,999 people to convince.

00:42:35.360 --> 00:42:41.120
 Do you want to hear some toddler things, sort of genuine toddlers?

00:42:41.120 --> 00:42:44.720
 I don't know if any of you are familiar with the Reddit of why my kid is crying, but it's

00:42:44.720 --> 00:42:45.720
 unbelievably good.

00:42:45.720 --> 00:42:48.820
 I just picked a few favorite examples.

00:42:48.820 --> 00:42:55.120
 Because I wouldn't let her eat a snotty tissue, both three-year-olds were inconsolable because

00:42:55.120 --> 00:42:58.820
 they wanted to hold the bag of poo I was taking to the bin.

00:42:58.820 --> 00:43:02.220
 And maybe my favorite, why is my kid crying?

00:43:02.220 --> 00:43:07.900
 Because Daddy's fart was louder than hers.

00:43:07.900 --> 00:43:09.460
 It's a very vulnerable age.

00:43:09.460 --> 00:43:10.980
 You've got to be careful.

00:43:10.980 --> 00:43:12.860
 You've got to be careful, yeah.

00:43:12.860 --> 00:43:18.560
 I find it very interesting the different levels at which toddlers develop and how it actually

00:43:18.560 --> 00:43:21.320
 is basically even across the world.

00:43:21.320 --> 00:43:27.400
 So the age at which kids walk is pretty much even maybe give or take a week or two weeks

00:43:27.400 --> 00:43:30.160
 across the world, except in Tajikistan.

00:43:30.160 --> 00:43:31.160
 What?

00:43:31.160 --> 00:43:32.160
 Yeah.

00:43:32.160 --> 00:43:33.160
 It's so weird.

00:43:33.160 --> 00:43:34.160
 What?

00:43:34.160 --> 00:43:37.720
 And there's this amazing thing that every single Tajik parent does pretty much, which

00:43:37.720 --> 00:43:43.300
 is that they have these things called Gavoras, which are cradles, but their kids stay in

00:43:43.300 --> 00:43:44.300
 all the time.

00:43:44.300 --> 00:43:47.340
 So for the first six months of their life, their kids are in it literally for 23 hours

00:43:47.340 --> 00:43:48.340
 a day.

00:43:48.340 --> 00:43:53.260
 For the next six months, it's more like maybe 16 hours a day.

00:43:53.260 --> 00:43:58.780
 And they're lying in a cradle and they're strapped down fully, so only their head moves.

00:43:58.780 --> 00:44:02.740
 And there's a hole cut in the bottom of the cradle, and they've got a bare bottom.

00:44:02.740 --> 00:44:06.340
 And so any poo just falls out into a bucket underneath.

00:44:06.340 --> 00:44:10.880
 And there's a tube attached to them so that any wee gets siphoned into wherever it gets

00:44:10.880 --> 00:44:11.880
 siphoned.

00:44:11.880 --> 00:44:12.880
 What?

00:44:12.880 --> 00:44:13.880
 And this is how they live.

00:44:13.880 --> 00:44:15.320
 And this is what all Tajik mothers do.

00:44:15.320 --> 00:44:17.440
 Almost 100% of Tajik mothers do this.

00:44:17.440 --> 00:44:21.600
 And they spend nine to 23 hours a day in it until they're three or four.

00:44:21.600 --> 00:44:24.320
 So understandably, they are a bit slower to crawl.

00:44:24.320 --> 00:44:29.720
 So by the age of one, almost all infants in most cultures are crawling.

00:44:29.720 --> 00:44:32.240
 Only 60% of Tajik children do it.

00:44:32.240 --> 00:44:35.840
 The good news is the fascinating thing is that by four, they've all caught up.

00:44:35.840 --> 00:44:39.780
 So it doesn't really make a blind bit of difference, these things, when you're thinking, "Oh, my

00:44:39.780 --> 00:44:41.640
 child's not talking or walking."

00:44:41.640 --> 00:44:42.640
 But isn't that mad?

00:44:42.640 --> 00:44:47.020
 Their kids are just strapped to a cradle with a poo hole in the bottom for three years,

00:44:47.020 --> 00:44:48.620
 the first three years of their life.

00:44:48.620 --> 00:44:49.620
 That is crazy.

00:44:49.620 --> 00:44:50.620
 Insane.

00:44:50.620 --> 00:44:51.620
 I know.

00:44:51.620 --> 00:44:52.620
 It's great.

00:44:52.620 --> 00:44:53.620
 What a life.

00:44:53.620 --> 00:44:54.620
 What a great life.

00:44:54.620 --> 00:44:56.300
 That is a good life.

00:44:56.300 --> 00:45:01.300
 I really thought Dan's John Lennon Christ God lightning thing was going to be the weirdest

00:45:01.300 --> 00:45:03.900
 thing we heard during this fact.

00:45:03.900 --> 00:45:07.840
 We're going to have to wrap up very soon, guys.

00:45:07.840 --> 00:45:10.400
 Can I give you a couple of old-fashioned words for children?

00:45:10.400 --> 00:45:11.400
 Sure.

00:45:11.400 --> 00:45:12.400
 Sure.

00:45:12.400 --> 00:45:20.400
 There's a squeaker, which was defined as a bar boy, also a bastard or any other child.

00:45:20.400 --> 00:45:24.000
 There's a tit, which was an old name for a Prim Young lass.

00:45:24.000 --> 00:45:25.000
 You tit.

00:45:25.000 --> 00:45:29.400
 I think that's not how you speak to a Prim Young lass.

00:45:29.400 --> 00:45:31.400
 It is how I do.

00:45:31.400 --> 00:45:38.260
 A bandling is just a child, a braggling is a 16th-century child, sucker is from 1384

00:45:38.260 --> 00:45:44.460
 for a child who's still nursing, sucker, and chitty face is a little puny child.

00:45:44.460 --> 00:45:47.220
 If you want to just keep that word and keep it going.

00:45:47.220 --> 00:45:48.220
 Right.

00:45:48.220 --> 00:45:51.460
 So there's handy for if your friends are new parents, you can throw those their way.

00:45:51.460 --> 00:45:53.580
 Oh, what a lovely little chitty face.

00:45:53.580 --> 00:45:58.620
 I found a thing which is a stubborn child law, and this was used in the General Court

00:45:58.620 --> 00:46:01.500
 of Massachusetts in 1646.

00:46:01.500 --> 00:46:06.880
 So this is the description of what you as a parent are allowed to do if you have a tantrum

00:46:06.880 --> 00:46:07.880
 child.

00:46:07.880 --> 00:46:12.220
 "Shall his father and mother, being his natural parents, lay hold of him and bring him to

00:46:12.220 --> 00:46:17.480
 the magistrates assembled in court to testify on them that their son is stubborn and rebellious

00:46:17.480 --> 00:46:23.120
 and will not obey their voice and lives with notorious crimes, and such a son shall be put

00:46:23.120 --> 00:46:24.120
 to death."

00:46:24.120 --> 00:46:25.120
 Not?

00:46:25.120 --> 00:46:26.120
 Yeah.

00:46:26.120 --> 00:46:29.840
 It's a real plot twist right at the end there.

00:46:29.840 --> 00:46:34.740
 Is there no option of just having a word with them first?

00:46:34.740 --> 00:46:35.740
 Wow.

00:46:35.740 --> 00:46:36.740
 Yeah.

00:46:36.740 --> 00:46:43.380
 Octopuses, throw tantrums, and at once, especially males when they don't get sex.

00:46:43.380 --> 00:46:45.780
 Sorry, octopuses, you said.

00:46:45.780 --> 00:46:46.780
 Octopuses.

00:46:46.780 --> 00:46:49.120
 I must have misheard that as humans.

00:46:49.120 --> 00:46:50.120
 Okay.

00:46:50.120 --> 00:46:56.440
 All right, that is it, everyone.

00:46:56.440 --> 00:46:57.780
 That is all of our facts.

00:46:57.780 --> 00:46:59.280
 Thank you so much, Brisbane.

00:46:59.280 --> 00:47:00.280
 That was awesome.

00:47:00.280 --> 00:47:01.280
 It's amazing being here.

00:47:01.280 --> 00:47:03.280
 We will be back again, and we'll be back again next week with another episode.

00:47:03.280 --> 00:47:04.280
 We'll see you then.

00:47:04.280 --> 00:47:04.780
 Goodbye!

00:47:04.780 --> 00:47:14.780
 [applause]

00:47:14.780 --> 00:47:17.360
 (upbeat music)
