00:00:00,00:00:05,"Hi everyone, welcome to this week's episode of No Such Thing as a Fish, where we were"
00:00:05,00:00:11,joined by a special guest and that was Helen Scales.
00:00:11,00:00:17,"Now if you don't know Helen, she is a marine biologist, a writer, a broadcaster."
00:00:17,00:00:18,"We've known her for many, many years."
00:00:18,00:00:22,"She's so funny, so interesting, she loves her subject so much."
00:00:22,00:00:25,Her books are absolutely great.
00:00:25,00:00:27,The first one that she wrote was called Spirals in Time.
00:00:27,00:00:32,"I think that was the first one, which was all about shells and the history of shells."
00:00:32,00:00:37,And her most recent one is called What the Wild Sea Can Be.
00:00:37,00:00:42,"And it is basically a look at the future of the oceans, which you might think is quite"
00:00:42,00:00:45,negative because of all the news stories that are going around.
00:00:45,00:00:50,"But Helen, as is her want, is very positive about what the future might be and how we"
00:00:50,00:00:52,can save the world.
00:00:52,00:00:57,"If you'd like to get her books, obviously they're available from all the usual places."
00:00:57,00:01:02,"But if you go to helenscales.com, you can visit her shop, which is related to the online"
00:01:02,00:01:04,bookseller's bookshop.
00:01:04,00:01:09,"And if you go there, then all her commissions will go to the charity Sea Changers."
00:01:09,00:01:13,So you'll help save the sea as well as learning about the sea.
00:01:13,00:01:17,There's also details on her website about a couple of shows she's doing to promote the
00:01:17,00:01:20,"book, so make sure you have a look at that if you like what you hear in this episode."
00:01:20,00:01:22,And I know that you will.
00:01:22,00:01:25,"One more thing to say, you know we have a tour coming up."
00:01:25,00:01:31,There are still tickets for most of the UK dates and a couple of the Australia dates
00:01:31,00:01:32,left for that.
00:01:32,00:01:40,So do get your tickets ASAP and the people of Sydney and London do go back to know such
00:01:40,00:01:45,things as fish.com/live because there are details of new dates on there.
00:01:45,00:01:50,"So if you missed out on tickets to Sydney or London, then fear not because we have put"
00:01:50,00:01:51,some more dates on.
00:01:51,00:01:52,"Okay, that's it."
00:01:52,00:01:53,That's all I have to say this week.
00:01:53,00:01:58,So really all there is left to say is on with the podcast.
00:01:58,00:01:59,So let's say it.
00:01:59,00:02:18,On with the podcast.
00:02:18,00:02:23,"Hello and welcome to another episode of No Such Thing as a Fish, a weekly podcast coming"
00:02:23,00:02:26,to you from the QI offices in Hoburn.
00:02:26,00:02:30,"My name is Anna Tyshinski and I'm sitting here with Andrew Hunter Murray, James Harkin"
00:02:30,00:02:34,"and extra special guest today, Helen Scales."
00:02:34,00:02:38,And we have gathered round on microphones with our four favourite facts from the last
00:02:38,00:02:39,seven days.
00:02:39,00:02:45,So in no particular order here we go.
00:02:45,00:02:47,Starting with Helen.
00:02:47,00:02:50,My fact is you can play peek-a-boo with an octopus.
00:02:50,00:02:51,Wow.
00:02:51,00:02:54,That sounds like fun.
00:02:54,00:02:56,I think it was peek-a-boo.
00:02:56,00:02:57,That's what I was doing.
00:02:57,00:02:58,Because you've done this.
00:02:58,00:02:59,Yeah.
00:02:59,00:03:00,Yeah.
00:03:00,00:03:01,That's a personal fact.
00:03:01,00:03:02,Exactly.
00:03:02,00:03:03,How did peek-a-boo work?
00:03:03,00:03:04,Because the game is quite rules-wise.
00:03:04,00:03:05,I think so.
00:03:05,00:03:06,Yeah.
00:03:06,00:03:07,Maybe it was hide and seek.
00:03:07,00:03:08,"No, I think it was peek-a-boo."
00:03:08,00:03:14,So basically I was coming back from a freedive or a snorkel if I want to make it sound not
00:03:14,00:03:16,"as cool, but I'll say freedive because that does sound cooler."
00:03:16,00:03:20,And I was literally just a couple of feet from the beach and the water was like knee-high
00:03:20,00:03:24,"and I looked down, I was floating and I looked down and there was an octopus behind a rock"
00:03:24,00:03:29,"and I was like, awesome because I love octopuses and I see them occasionally, but it's definitely"
00:03:29,00:03:30,a special thing to see.
00:03:30,00:03:31,Where were you in the world?
00:03:31,00:03:32,"Oh, sorry."
00:03:32,00:03:33,I was in Brittany in France.
00:03:33,00:03:34,Very nice.
00:03:34,00:03:35,Yeah.
00:03:35,00:03:38,"So there was this octopus and I was like, awesome, okay, fantastic."
00:03:38,00:03:45,And then generally when I see exciting animals like that you have to be like just looking
00:03:45,00:03:48,"as much as possible because any second now it's going to just fuck off, right?"
00:03:48,00:03:51,"And you're left with like, oh, that was a lovely encounter, but it lasted like seconds."
00:03:51,00:03:56,But this one didn't move and I was just hanging out with it and how big are we talking?
00:03:56,00:04:01,"I mean, in my mind it was like maybe a small melon sized, I think, kind of thing."
00:04:01,00:04:02,Okay.
00:04:02,00:04:06,"So first off, I did the My Octopus Teacher Touching thing."
00:04:06,00:04:07,Have you seen My Octopus?
00:04:07,00:04:08,No.
00:04:08,00:04:09,"No, not really."
00:04:09,00:04:13,"There's a bit basically where if you put your hand out, an octopus will reach out and touch"
00:04:13,00:04:14,you with its arms.
00:04:14,00:04:16,"Oh, so it's like God and Adam in the Michelangelo."
00:04:16,00:04:17,"Exactly, exactly."
00:04:17,00:04:18,But God is an octopus.
00:04:18,00:04:19,And they do do that.
00:04:19,00:04:22,"They basically, they're tasting you to see what you are because their suckers are really"
00:04:22,00:04:24,sensitive and they can have you like taste the chemicals and stuff.
00:04:24,00:04:27,"So I put my hand out and it did, it's like put its little arm out and it's tiny and thin"
00:04:27,00:04:32,"at the end and it was like, yeah, but it touched me and I was like, oh, that was amazing."
00:04:32,00:04:36,"And then so we did that and I was like, okay, so what else can I do with this octopus, you"
00:04:36,00:04:37,"know, while it's got my-"
00:04:37,00:04:38,Let's pick it up a notch.
00:04:38,00:04:42,"So I was like, well, what if I just hide it from it?"
00:04:42,00:04:44,Maybe you'll try and come and find me.
00:04:44,00:04:45,Wow.
00:04:45,00:04:47,And so I moved out of its line of sight.
00:04:47,00:04:49,So that it couldn't see me.
00:04:49,00:04:51,"And it was just, it just like peered around the rock."
00:04:51,00:04:53,"You know, it was definitely like, where have you gone?"
00:04:53,00:04:54,You're over there.
00:04:54,00:04:56,"And I'm like, no, you go."
00:04:56,00:05:01,But I just really had this sense of something a bit more intelligent and it's thinking about
00:05:01,00:05:03,you and it's interacting with you.
00:05:03,00:05:05,"And it was just really, a really cool moment."
00:05:05,00:05:08,So it didn't then hide from you or anything like that?
00:05:08,00:05:09,"No, it didn't hide from me."
00:05:09,00:05:12,"Then I think at that point I was like, I'm getting really cold and I need to get out."
00:05:12,00:05:15,Can you do something a bit more interesting than just sit there?
00:05:15,00:05:17,"And so I think I was like, I'm going to get a bit closer."
00:05:17,00:05:21,"And at that point it was like, and it went off and changed it."
00:05:21,00:05:25,"You know, you hear about how octopuses change color and texture and stuff, and it really"
00:05:25,00:05:26,did.
00:05:26,00:05:27,It had been like pale and smooth.
00:05:27,00:05:30,And then instantly it turned like really angry red and very bumpy.
00:05:30,00:05:31,"And I was like, oh, wow."
00:05:31,00:05:32,Sorry.
00:05:32,00:05:33,Are the bumps real?
00:05:33,00:05:34,Yeah.
00:05:34,00:05:35,Yeah.
00:05:35,00:05:36,So there's skin.
00:05:36,00:05:37,It's not just that it looks.
00:05:37,00:05:38,Yeah.
00:05:38,00:05:39,Yeah.
00:05:39,00:05:40,So there's skin is like loads of little muscles and they can pull up and make little like warts
00:05:40,00:05:43,and little bumps and then they can flat themselves out and change the color is also
00:05:43,00:05:44,the muscles too.
00:05:44,00:05:48,They have these like bubbles of pigment which can open and close and they can change their
00:05:48,00:05:49,color.
00:05:49,00:05:50,It's like pixels basically.
00:05:50,00:05:51,I knew that's how they show their color.
00:05:51,00:05:55,"I just sort of assume that they, I didn't assume anything, I just thought I did it."
00:05:55,00:05:56,"They didn't really think about it, did they?"
00:05:56,00:05:57,No.
00:05:57,00:05:58,No.
00:05:58,00:05:59,Because he wouldn't really.
00:05:59,00:06:00,They're just like the way that you blush maybe.
00:06:00,00:06:01,They might just change color.
00:06:01,00:06:02,Yeah.
00:06:02,00:06:03,They have layers in their skin.
00:06:03,00:06:04,We can't blush lots of colors.
00:06:04,00:06:05,No.
00:06:05,00:06:06,I find that we could blush loads of different colors.
00:06:06,00:06:07,Like I could blush blue if I was.
00:06:07,00:06:08,Exactly.
00:06:08,00:06:09,On command.
00:06:09,00:06:10,That would be like a really cool thing to do with like GM.
00:06:10,00:06:11,Right.
00:06:11,00:06:12,Just to like give ourselves chromatophores.
00:06:12,00:06:13,Yeah.
00:06:13,00:06:14,That would be good.
00:06:14,00:06:19,"It'd be like it'd be easier for those, you know those parties where you have to go in"
00:06:19,00:06:21,a color like if you're available you wear green.
00:06:21,00:06:23,"Oh, you'll swing those parties."
00:06:23,00:06:24,Yeah.
00:06:24,00:06:31,It's not always easy to find an Amber shirt.
00:06:31,00:06:33,They definitely do seem to be animals where you can have a bit of a relationship.
00:06:33,00:06:34,I think so.
00:06:34,00:06:35,Yeah.
00:06:35,00:06:38,"I mean, I'm not going to say I made friends with it, but I just felt like for a moment"
00:06:38,00:06:40,we had a bit of a play and that was cool.
00:06:40,00:06:42,"I mean, I haven't ever played with a crab, for instance."
00:06:42,00:06:45,That's never really worked out or a big try then.
00:06:45,00:06:46,Yeah.
00:06:46,00:06:47,The crabs just don't go for the peekaboo.
00:06:47,00:06:48,They really don't.
00:06:48,00:06:51,"Well, sometimes the octopuses don't want to be friends."
00:06:51,00:06:54,Like they seem to have such personalities that they're discerning about who they like.
00:06:54,00:06:58,"There was a person who worked in a New England aquarium who, one of the octopuses there just"
00:06:58,00:07:02,"completely took against him and used to squirt him in the room whenever he walked in, just"
00:07:02,00:07:04,actually hated him.
00:07:04,00:07:07,"And then I think he left and did a degree or something, left the university and he came"
00:07:07,00:07:11,"back and immediately the octopus was like, ""Not Barry again."""
00:07:11,00:07:12,And went with him again.
00:07:12,00:07:13,Yeah.
00:07:13,00:07:14,They are a bit moody like that.
00:07:14,00:07:15,Yeah.
00:07:15,00:07:19,I've heard stories about octopuses being given food they don't like and just being like this
00:07:19,00:07:23,"and they hold up to the person and go like, ""Uh-uh, see what I'm going to do with this?"""
00:07:23,00:07:26,"And they swim across to the other side of the tank and stuff it in the drain and be like,"
00:07:26,00:07:27,"""No."""
00:07:27,00:07:28,Wow.
00:07:28,00:07:29,That's where that's going.
00:07:29,00:07:30,"Like a toddler, basically."
00:07:30,00:07:31,Yeah.
00:07:31,00:07:32,I imagine there are all those sorts of studies of like intelligence that are about that kind
00:07:32,00:07:33,of level of...
00:07:33,00:07:35,I reckon although toddlers can't play hide and seek.
00:07:35,00:07:36,Can they not?
00:07:36,00:07:37,"No, no, no."
00:07:37,00:07:39,They just think you're not there when you close your eyes.
00:07:39,00:07:40,"Yeah, yeah."
00:07:40,00:07:44,They did a study where they gave a toddler a doll and they put a blindfold on the doll
00:07:44,00:07:46,and the toddler thought that they couldn't see it.
00:07:46,00:07:49,"Wait, they thought that the doll couldn't see the toddler?"
00:07:49,00:07:50,Yeah.
00:07:50,00:07:51,But the doll couldn't see the toddler either way?
00:07:51,00:07:52,"No, no, no."
00:07:52,00:07:55,They thought that the toddler thought the doll had gone invisible.
00:07:55,00:07:58,The doll had gone invisible because they don't think that because I feel like I've heard that
00:07:58,00:08:01,"kind of thing and obviously the study was done, but I've heard that kind of thing where like"
00:08:01,00:08:05,"they think if you club your eyes and you've gone, but when you do it with kids they don't"
00:08:05,00:08:06,think you've just...
00:08:06,00:08:07,I literally did it yesterday and it worked.
00:08:07,00:08:08,With you?
00:08:08,00:08:09,"Yeah, yeah."
00:08:09,00:08:10,So they just think that they can see your body?
00:08:10,00:08:13,"I said to her, I said, ""Look at me, that took a while."""
00:08:13,00:08:17,"She doesn't really do what I tell her, but then eventually she looked at me and I covered"
00:08:17,00:08:18,"my eyes and I said, ""Can you see me?"""
00:08:18,00:08:19,"And she said, ""No."""
00:08:19,00:08:23,Does that mean that she thinks she can't see you though or that she thinks the thing
00:08:23,00:08:24,to say in this game is no?
00:08:24,00:08:25,"Well, because..."
00:08:25,00:08:29,"It feels like if you vanished then children would be like, ""What the hell just happened?"""
00:08:29,00:08:33,"But the other evidence is that if you play hide and seek with a child, if they cover their"
00:08:33,00:08:35,eyes they think you can't see them.
00:08:35,00:08:39,"That's why just in the middle of the room, eyes closed, I'm hiding."
00:08:39,00:08:40,That's great.
00:08:40,00:08:41,Yeah.
00:08:41,00:08:43,"And the really interesting thing is it works for voices as well apparently, although I"
00:08:43,00:08:47,"tried this with my daughter and it didn't work, but apparently there was a study where"
00:08:47,00:08:51,"experimenters put their hands over their ears and said to the child, ""Can you hear me?"""
00:08:51,00:08:52,"And the child said, ""No, I can't hear you."""
00:08:52,00:08:57,"Now I did try this and it didn't work with my daughter, but I'm not sure if that means"
00:08:57,00:08:59,she's too smart or not smart enough.
00:08:59,00:09:04,"If you put on a different voice, will she think that, for example, Bruce Forsythe is"
00:09:04,00:09:05,in the room.
00:09:05,00:09:08,"And she's like, ""Nice to see you."""
00:09:08,00:09:12,"""I can't see you."""
00:09:12,00:09:16,"Octopus is, I think, have they been re-classed in Britain in terms of their intelligence?"
00:09:16,00:09:19,"Because they're so, literally they're so clever that the government has now classed them along"
00:09:19,00:09:21,with vertebrates.
00:09:21,00:09:26,"But they're way cleverer than most, not most, lots of vertebrates and they are classed as"
00:09:26,00:09:27,sentient beings.
00:09:27,00:09:28,That's right.
00:09:28,00:09:29,Yeah.
00:09:29,00:09:30,That's good news.
00:09:30,00:09:31,It is good news.
00:09:31,00:09:34,"It means, well, hopefully it means now we have to be nicer to them."
00:09:34,00:09:36,"Because there are all sorts of discussions about, ""Oh, should we farm them?"""
00:09:36,00:09:40,"And it's like, ""Should we farm these really intelligent, amazing, weird creatures?"""
00:09:40,00:09:44,"That don't like living together and they're generally cannibalistic and, you know, all"
00:09:44,00:09:45,sorts of stuff like that.
00:09:45,00:09:48,You don't want to farm like where all the cows are eating each other.
00:09:48,00:09:49,"Well, exactly."
00:09:49,00:09:53,You don't want there's one great big octopus left at the end and something that's no longer
00:09:53,00:09:55,going to be possible.
00:09:55,00:09:57,Chop it up and just just eat.
00:09:57,00:10:01,You might get the same number of steaks from one enormous cow that's eaten all the other
00:10:01,00:10:02,cows.
00:10:02,00:10:03,"And it's easier to herd, isn't it?"
00:10:03,00:10:04,If you just got one.
00:10:04,00:10:05,You're a big dog.
00:10:05,00:10:06,Yeah.
00:10:06,00:10:07,Very big dog.
00:10:07,00:10:08,It's tragic.
00:10:08,00:10:09,"They can't write, but they do pretty zinc."
00:10:09,00:10:11,"Oh, that is tragic."
00:10:11,00:10:15,Is that in the Alanis Morissette song?
00:10:15,00:10:17,Is it wasps or bees that can make paper?
00:10:17,00:10:18,"Yeah, wasps."
00:10:18,00:10:19,Wasps can make paper.
00:10:19,00:10:20,If they could get together.
00:10:20,00:10:21,Never the twain.
00:10:21,00:10:22,"Oh, that's tragic."
00:10:22,00:10:27,If you give a wasp a snorkel and imagine that you have it for two species could wreak.
00:10:27,00:10:28,What was it?
00:10:28,00:10:29,"Alanis Morissette, ironic."
00:10:29,00:10:30,Yeah.
00:10:30,00:10:31,But they weren't very ironic.
00:10:31,00:10:32,No.
00:10:32,00:10:33,They weren't very ironic.
00:10:33,00:10:34,They weren't very ironic.
00:10:34,00:10:35,There was someone else.
00:10:35,00:10:36,All right.
00:10:36,00:10:37,Avril Lavigne.
00:10:37,00:10:38,"No, it was."
00:10:38,00:10:39,It was.
00:10:39,00:10:40,You're thinking of skater by.
00:10:40,00:10:41,Yeah.
00:10:41,00:10:42,I could use the two the other day in the social situation.
00:10:42,00:10:43,And I haven't had the end of it yet.
00:10:43,00:10:44,Anyway.
00:10:44,00:10:45,He was a wasp.
00:10:45,00:10:46,She was an octopus.
00:10:46,00:10:51,Can I make it any more obvious?
00:10:51,00:10:53,They're very strong octopuses as well.
00:10:53,00:10:56,"Every sucker is so powerful, isn't it?"
00:10:56,00:10:58,And I think I worked out.
00:10:58,00:11:02,"So if a sucker touches an object, it changes shape to form this seal around it."
00:11:02,00:11:07,"And I realized that the common octopus, if it's hanging off the ceiling, the four of"
00:11:07,00:11:11,"us, and I've done some vague weight estimates, and I think it wouldn't be true if Dan was"
00:11:11,00:11:12,here.
00:11:12,00:11:21,"But I think the four of us, that is no heavier than I am, for sure."
00:11:21,00:11:25,"But James, who does Dan have to be heavier than for this to work with the four of us,"
00:11:25,00:11:26,but not if Dan was here?
00:11:26,00:11:27,"No, I do see that."
00:11:27,00:11:28,I do see it.
00:11:28,00:11:30,But it did sound like a slam on Dan's head.
00:11:30,00:11:34,"Look, I think we can safely say that Helen is a few inches shorter than Dan's, but they're"
00:11:34,00:11:35,both in great shape.
00:11:35,00:11:37,But Dan probably weighs a few pounds more.
00:11:37,00:11:41,"Once I was in the ITV studios on the South Bank, and there was a load of people in the"
00:11:41,00:11:46,"lift, and I walked into the lift, and it went beep, beep, beep, please leave the lift, because"
00:11:46,00:11:51,"I was the person who put it over the level, and I felt awful, like it was a really low"
00:11:51,00:11:52,moment in my life.
00:11:52,00:11:57,"But imagine that if all your mates are hanging off an octopus, and you're the one that pulls"
00:11:57,00:11:58,him down.
00:11:58,00:11:59,"No, that's it."
00:11:59,00:12:00,I'm letting go.
00:12:00,00:12:04,Do you know what happens if you cut the arm off an octopus?
00:12:04,00:12:06,"So this is, you know, if you want to eat it."
00:12:06,00:12:07,Does it live?
00:12:07,00:12:08,Yeah.
00:12:08,00:12:11,"So fishermen will chop the arms off and stick them in the bucket, and they try to climb"
00:12:11,00:12:12,"out, basically."
00:12:12,00:12:17,"So octopus have like 500 million neurons, but half of them are in their arms."
00:12:17,00:12:22,"So they have a very different kind of nerve system to us, but it's not all in their brain."
00:12:22,00:12:25,"So the question is, like, do they think for themselves these arms?"
00:12:25,00:12:27,So they're like actually able to make their own decisions.
00:12:27,00:12:31,But what we think they're doing is that their kind of response is to pass food towards the
00:12:31,00:12:32,mouth.
00:12:32,00:12:34,"So if a bit of food goes to the end of the arm, the suckers are like passing it to the"
00:12:34,00:12:36,next one and to the next one.
00:12:36,00:12:40,"And actually that same motion, if you've chopped an arm off in a bucket, is climb out of the"
00:12:40,00:12:41,bucket.
00:12:41,00:12:42,Do you see what I mean?
00:12:42,00:12:43,So they're just trying to pass.
00:12:43,00:12:45,"They're just like, this is the thing we do."
00:12:45,00:12:52,"So it's not, there's not necessarily any thought in it, but they will basically walk off."
00:12:52,00:12:55,"The other thing, if you cut the very tip of an arm, it will still respond to like nasty"
00:12:55,00:12:56,chemicals.
00:12:56,00:12:59,So people who are like doing science and they'll take just a little bit of tissue off and then
00:12:59,00:13:03,"you try and put the little tip of the arm into a pot of alcohol and it goes, oh no, ow."
00:13:03,00:13:06,"Oh, are we calling alcohol a nasty chemical?"
00:13:06,00:13:07,"Oh, sorry."
00:13:07,00:13:13,"Well, I guess very high concentrations of alcohol used to preserve the tip of an octopus's arm."
00:13:13,00:13:14,100% scientific stuff.
00:13:14,00:13:17,"Unfortunately for you, Helen, that's what Anna likes to do."
00:13:17,00:13:18,My limbs have cut off.
00:13:18,00:13:19,Go towards.
00:13:19,00:13:25,Just a thumbs up for Anna's removed and.
00:13:25,00:13:27,"You don't eat octopuses, right?"
00:13:27,00:13:28,"No, I don't."
00:13:28,00:13:29,No.
00:13:29,00:13:30,Do you eat other fish?
00:13:30,00:13:31,Sometimes.
00:13:31,00:13:32,And not much anymore.
00:13:32,00:13:33,I did for a long time.
00:13:33,00:13:36,I gave up eating meat years and years ago and I kind of kept on eating sustainably caught
00:13:36,00:13:38,fish.
00:13:38,00:13:40,But definitely octopuses you wouldn't eat octopuses.
00:13:40,00:13:41,"No, not since meeting one."
00:13:41,00:13:42,I definitely not since playing peek-a-boo with one.
00:13:42,00:13:43,I couldn't.
00:13:43,00:13:48,Something else that needs to avoid eating octopuses is the dolphin.
00:13:48,00:13:51,"Although, I mean, they do like to sometimes and octopuses are really good food for other"
00:13:51,00:13:55,"sea animals because I guess they're very meaty, but they're quite dangerous to swallow."
00:13:55,00:14:01,"And I think when dolphins do eat octopuses, they have to really work hard on cutting up"
00:14:01,00:14:03,their food to tear them to shreds because they did.
00:14:03,00:14:07,"I think they found a dead dolphin recently in the last couple of years, which had an"
00:14:07,00:14:12,octopus in its mouth and you can see its tentacles like flopping out of its mouth.
00:14:12,00:14:16,So if I'm a dolphin and I have an octopus and it sort of clings onto the inside of
00:14:16,00:14:20,"my throat as it's going down, because I haven't chewed it properly, does it pull me inside"
00:14:20,00:14:21,out is what I'm trying to say?
00:14:21,00:14:22,Why?
00:14:22,00:14:25,"I'll end up coming in to work the next day saying, ""Oh, I think I had a doggie octopus"
00:14:25,00:14:29,"last night because it's attached to the inside of the tube that is me."""
00:14:29,00:14:30,Yes.
00:14:30,00:14:31,"Yeah, how's it done that?"
00:14:31,00:14:32,And it's gone all the way through.
00:14:32,00:14:35,I don't think the dolphin was inside out when they found it and afraid that would be even
00:14:35,00:14:40,"more grotesque than the already the truth, which is like you say it suckers onto their"
00:14:40,00:14:43,"esophagus until it chokes them to death, which is quite clever."
00:14:43,00:14:44,Yeah.
00:14:44,00:14:45,Because they'd be trained.
00:14:45,00:14:47,"The CIA are always training dolphins and things, aren't they?"
00:14:47,00:14:48,Good point.
00:14:48,00:14:49,Yeah.
00:14:49,00:14:52,"Are you thinking, Andy, that we can defeat the CIA for whatever reason we might want"
00:14:52,00:14:56,to by sending an army of octopuses to turn the dolphins inside out?
00:14:56,00:14:57,"Oh, yeah."
00:14:57,00:15:01,"I'll send a strong message, won't I?"
00:15:01,00:15:03,Britain is back on the global stage.
00:15:03,00:15:07,We've inverted every dolphin the CIA has ever trained.
00:15:07,00:15:15,"Okay, it's time for fact number two and that is my fact."
00:15:15,00:15:20,"My fact this week is that during winter, the ground is too cold for male emperor penguins"
00:15:20,00:15:21,feet.
00:15:21,00:15:25,So they spend two months leaning back and balancing on their heels.
00:15:25,00:15:27,That's great.
00:15:27,00:15:30,It's just so painful and uncomfortable.
00:15:30,00:15:34,"They sound like kind of relaxed dads, you know, they're leaning back on their tail."
00:15:34,00:15:39,"Like they lean back on the little sort of like a hunting stick, I guess."
00:15:39,00:15:42,"Is that what it, you know, those shooting sticks?"
00:15:42,00:15:43,Shooting sticks.
00:15:43,00:15:44,Yeah.
00:15:44,00:15:45,"Oh, the lady sits on the beach."
00:15:45,00:15:46,Yeah.
00:15:46,00:15:48,"So, yeah, I'm guessing you're very familiar with this and we should just say why they"
00:15:48,00:15:49,have to do this.
00:15:49,00:15:50,Because it's cold.
00:15:50,00:15:51,Because it's cold.
00:15:51,00:15:52,Really cold.
00:15:52,00:15:55,"Because it's really, really cold."
00:15:55,00:15:56,It's freezing.
00:15:56,00:15:57,They're in Antarctica.
00:15:57,00:16:01,It's minus 40 Celsius and the female essentially lays her egg.
00:16:01,00:16:05,I think this is right and it's in the middle of winter because they need to start incubating
00:16:05,00:16:09,the egg so that it's born in nice springtime when there's lots of food.
00:16:09,00:16:13,"So middle of winter, cold as possible time, the females laid the egg, plopped it in front"
00:16:13,00:16:19,"of the male, disappeared for a couple of months and they have this incredible pouch that they"
00:16:19,00:16:23,plop over the egg and the egg balances on his feet.
00:16:23,00:16:26,"But then if his feet are flat on the ground, then they just get super, super cold."
00:16:26,00:16:31,"And so, as you say, he leans back and like a tripod balances on his tail for two months."
00:16:31,00:16:33,I'd vaguely seen that they did this.
00:16:33,00:16:36,I had no idea about the details and how difficult it is.
00:16:36,00:16:38,The dads can only eat snow for those months.
00:16:38,00:16:40,"They get pretty skinny, don't they, by the end?"
00:16:40,00:16:44,"They lose half their weight sometimes, or 40% and the dads basically had an enormous mega"
00:16:44,00:16:45,barbecue the summer before.
00:16:45,00:16:48,"All the dads hang out, they put on lots and lots of weight because they know they're going"
00:16:48,00:16:49,to need it.
00:16:49,00:16:50,They use it all up.
00:16:50,00:16:51,"Oh, that's interesting."
00:16:51,00:16:55,So when am I going to lose this weight that I thought I'm going to have to be in a dad's
00:16:55,00:16:56,sect?
00:16:56,00:17:00,You need to head on down south and spend quite a bit of time on the sea ice.
00:17:00,00:17:02,They just lose no heat.
00:17:02,00:17:05,"Scientists did the sort of, you know, those heat map body things that you do, you know,"
00:17:05,00:17:07,you see where someone's losing heat.
00:17:07,00:17:12,And I think they found that the only places they're losing heat are through their eyes.
00:17:12,00:17:20,"You know, in Dune, the film Dune and the book Dune, they've got those still suits, which"
00:17:20,00:17:22,allow them to lose zero moisture.
00:17:22,00:17:24,"Yeah, they're really good."
00:17:24,00:17:25,They're basically in the desert.
00:17:25,00:17:26,We're on the planet Arrakis.
00:17:26,00:17:27,We get the idea.
00:17:27,00:17:28,"Yeah, yeah."
00:17:28,00:17:31,"But they've got these suits, which means they lose no moisture."
00:17:32,00:17:34,Emperor penguins are basically that bodily.
00:17:34,00:17:35,They just can't do it and not lose heat.
00:17:35,00:17:38,"Yeah, they get so hot, like, you know, they do that huddling thing, the males, when there's"
00:17:38,00:17:42,"a blizzard and they all cuddle together, they can be like so hot, they have to break apart"
00:17:42,00:17:44,"and be like, oh, God, I need some steaming."
00:17:44,00:17:45,Yeah.
00:17:45,00:17:49,"It sounds like more, it sounds more of a thing, which you wouldn't think because you see them"
00:17:49,00:17:52,"in documentaries and you feel so sorry for how cold they must be, but actually it seems"
00:17:52,00:17:54,like overheating is more of a problem.
00:17:54,00:17:55,"Actually, potentially more of a problem."
00:17:55,00:17:56,Yeah.
00:17:56,00:17:59,"And I always thought that those big huddles where, you know, hundreds of them, as you"
00:17:59,00:18:01,"say, plump together, don't they, and they rotate, who's on the inside."
00:18:01,00:18:04,I always thought they lasted for ages.
00:18:04,00:18:08,"That was kind of how they stood, but apparently it's about 50 minutes each one last."
00:18:08,00:18:12,"And it's really like, yeah, when it blows through and it's really cold."
00:18:12,00:18:14,Do you think they don't feel cold then?
00:18:14,00:18:17,I think they would if they got cold.
00:18:17,00:18:19,It just sounds like that they don't.
00:18:19,00:18:23,"Their threshold is just way lower than humans, so it's, I think it's down to minus 10 Celsius."
00:18:23,00:18:24,They're basically comfortable.
00:18:24,00:18:30,"Well, actually that's the same as someone from Newcastle, I think."
00:18:30,00:18:32,That's why the black and white is the essence.
00:18:32,00:18:34,"They're still a bit chilly then, I guess."
00:18:34,00:18:37,"If minus 10, they're comfortable, minus 40, they're probably like, that's when they're"
00:18:37,00:18:39,"like, oh, let's all, you know, let's get through it."
00:18:39,00:18:43,"Do they have human conceptions of discomfort in the way that we do, you know, I don't know."
00:18:43,00:18:46,"Well, that comes back to the whole sentient thing, you know, that's kind of the big thing"
00:18:46,00:18:47,of that.
00:18:47,00:18:48,"It's like, are they suffering?"
00:18:48,00:18:51,Is the first penguin dad to suggest a huddle looked on as a bit of a wuss?
00:18:51,00:18:52,Yeah.
00:18:52,00:18:55,"Is everyone secretly hoping someone's going to do it, but no one wants to be the first"
00:18:55,00:18:56,one?
00:18:56,00:18:59,"Oh, I'm not going to hug you."
00:18:59,00:19:01,I'm just trying to eat.
00:19:01,00:19:04,"One thing I like about the whole penguin feather thing is, if you've seen the video, if you've"
00:19:04,00:19:09,"seen kind of on Blue Planet or whatever it was, the emperor penguins whooshing up underwater"
00:19:09,00:19:13,"and jumping out, like they do this kind of leaps, right?"
00:19:13,00:19:16,"They basically, that's like, need to get out of the water because there's probably something"
00:19:16,00:19:20,"coming to eat me, but my little legs aren't going to be very good at clambering off onto"
00:19:20,00:19:21,the ice.
00:19:21,00:19:24,So they swim up from deep down and it's skin that's their feathers.
00:19:24,00:19:27,"So basically as they go down, they hold their contour feathers, the outside ones in place,"
00:19:27,00:19:29,they lock them in place so that the air is trapped.
00:19:29,00:19:33,"And then as they're coming up, they basically let that air out and it all comes fizzing out"
00:19:33,00:19:39,of the little under fuzzy bits and forms a stream of bubbles and it's called air lubrication
00:19:39,00:19:42,and basically reduces the friction against the water.
00:19:42,00:19:47,And so they go a bit faster and they go popping out the water at the top and then they land
00:19:47,00:19:50,"on the ice and they've got even, they've got a nice little tummy, the fronts are covered"
00:19:50,00:19:51,with more feathers.
00:19:51,00:19:53,"So when they land, it's nice cushion."
00:19:53,00:19:54,That is so cool.
00:19:54,00:19:55,That's not really good.
00:19:55,00:20:00,"They've got tricks for days, they're really, they're a real risk of climate change, aren't"
00:20:00,00:20:01,they?
00:20:01,00:20:02,"Yeah, sadly, yes."
00:20:02,00:20:06,"They live on sea ice and if sea ice melts, that's the, this bit, specifically this bit"
00:20:06,00:20:10,"with the males and the, and the chick rearing is on the sea ice and it's all on the outside,"
00:20:10,00:20:11,isn't it?
00:20:11,00:20:12,"Yeah, exactly."
00:20:12,00:20:13,Because they need access to the sea.
00:20:13,00:20:17,"If the ice melts basically, then that means they, like lots of colonies have had complete"
00:20:17,00:20:21,breeding failures where no chick survived to the next year and it's happened two years
00:20:21,00:20:22,in a row now.
00:20:22,00:20:23,"It's really, it's really bad."
00:20:23,00:20:24,Yeah.
00:20:24,00:20:28,"And I think the idea is that if the world keeps to 1.5 degrees of warming, then the numbers"
00:20:28,00:20:32,"will hold up much, much better than if it goes far beyond that, you know."
00:20:32,00:20:34,"So that, yeah, no, it definitely matters."
00:20:34,00:20:37,"Like every degree, every degree we can like avoid of heating, like the better the emperor"
00:20:37,00:20:38,penguins will do.
00:20:38,00:20:42,"And you know, like the cool thing I love about it as well is how we study numbers of penguins"
00:20:42,00:20:43,is from satellites.
00:20:43,00:20:47,There's like once a week a satellite passes over Antarctica and takes photos and you
00:20:47,00:20:51,"can only do that during the summer because it's dark during the winter, obviously, and"
00:20:51,00:20:53,you can't see anything.
00:20:53,00:20:56,"But in the summer months, they pass over and take photos and then you can count the penguins"
00:20:56,00:20:58,and they're poo basically.
00:20:58,00:21:00,The guano stains the ice and you can see where they are.
00:21:00,00:21:02,So that's how you figure out how many there are.
00:21:02,00:21:07,"And so basically the end of the winter, when the sun comes up again, it's like fingers crossed"
00:21:07,00:21:08,everybody.
00:21:08,00:21:10,I like how many are still there?
00:21:10,00:21:11,Like how many of these...
00:21:11,00:21:13,You're looking for a huge poo on the ice.
00:21:13,00:21:14,"Basically, yeah."
00:21:14,00:21:15,And then that's when we see.
00:21:15,00:21:18,"This year, we won't know till because it's just going dark now."
00:21:18,00:21:24,"We won't know till like September, October how this year's clutch of penguins has done."
00:21:24,00:21:29,"I wonder if they take into account the level of poo by which I mean, like, let's say your"
00:21:29,00:21:33,penguins are not eating very well for whatever reason.
00:21:33,00:21:34,They might poo less.
00:21:34,00:21:37,"And I wonder if when they look at it, they can be honest."
00:21:37,00:21:38,Yeah.
00:21:38,00:21:40,"I don't know whether they do the poo for individual numbers or whether they're just like, here's"
00:21:40,00:21:41,a colony.
00:21:41,00:21:42,I see.
00:21:42,00:21:43,That's generally there.
00:21:43,00:21:45,You can actually see like a little shadow.
00:21:45,00:21:46,That's how good the satellites are.
00:21:46,00:21:51,"You can see, and they're so tall that you can see a penguin's shadow in the satellite images"
00:21:51,00:21:52,and then for count each individual.
00:21:52,00:21:53,Yeah.
00:21:53,00:21:57,"And actually, I think one really interesting thing is you can tell how many individuals"
00:21:57,00:22:01,there are in one of these huddles by knowing the size of the huddle and the temperature
00:22:01,00:22:06,outside because they're really mathematically precise.
00:22:06,00:22:07,They go into like hexagons.
00:22:07,00:22:10,You know how hexagons are the best way at packing things?
00:22:10,00:22:14,"If you kind of take a big pile of penguins, you know how much they're huddling because"
00:22:14,00:22:18,"you know how cold it is and you just put a load of hexagons on that grid, that's how"
00:22:18,00:22:19,many penguins there are.
00:22:19,00:22:20,"Oh, what do you mean?"
00:22:20,00:22:21,"If it's colder, they'll go closer."
00:22:21,00:22:22,That'll suddenly tend to amnesia.
00:22:22,00:22:23,Yeah.
00:22:23,00:22:26,"I don't know whether to be more impressed by scientists or penguins than that, as if"
00:22:26,00:22:28,working that out is unbelievable.
00:22:28,00:22:29,Then working it out as penguins is unbelievable.
00:22:29,00:22:31,I'm just saying that's fine for everyone.
00:22:31,00:22:32,They're really cool.
00:22:32,00:22:33,Yeah.
00:22:33,00:22:39,"I didn't know that part of Scott's expedition was about penguin eggs, collecting penguin"
00:22:39,00:22:40,eggs.
00:22:40,00:22:41,So crazy.
00:22:41,00:22:42,It's Scott of the Antarctic.
00:22:42,00:22:43,Yeah.
00:22:43,00:22:44,That one.
00:22:44,00:22:49,"So 1910 to 1913 is Teranova expedition, a lesser known part of it in I think 1911."
00:22:49,00:22:50,"It's 11, yeah."
00:22:50,00:22:55,"It was where three of them, so I think it was sort of the brainchild or the person who's"
00:22:55,00:22:59,"most passionate about it was Edward Wilson, who was Scott's second in command."
00:22:59,00:23:04,"Then there was this other chap called Apsley Cherry Garrod, but they were there to go and"
00:23:04,00:23:08,"collect emperor penguin eggs, weren't they, because they believed it was going to be really"
00:23:08,00:23:09,evolutionaryly important.
00:23:09,00:23:10,"Yes, that's right."
00:23:10,00:23:11,A link between.
00:23:11,00:23:12,Yeah.
00:23:12,00:23:15,"They thought they were the oldest birds, and that there was this theory of recapitulation,"
00:23:15,00:23:20,"which totally fell out of favor, but the idea that an embryo retraces its evolutionary"
00:23:20,00:23:22,heritage of its ancestor.
00:23:22,00:23:26,"So it would kind of basically start off in its egg as a little reptile, and then turn"
00:23:26,00:23:28,into a bird as it was growing.
00:23:28,00:23:32,And so it kind of totally comes back to this whole like crazy winters and the males with
00:23:32,00:23:36,"the eggs on their feet, because the only way to get an egg with an embryo in it is to go"
00:23:36,00:23:37,in the middle of winter.
00:23:37,00:23:38,Absolutely.
00:23:38,00:23:39,Come out.
00:23:39,00:23:40,Yeah.
00:23:40,00:23:42,"And not only is it freezing cold, of course, pitch dark."
00:23:42,00:23:43,Dark cold.
00:23:43,00:23:44,They kept falling down like holes in the ice.
00:23:44,00:23:45,It was so ridiculous.
00:23:45,00:23:48,But then surely you've also got to fight an angry dad.
00:23:48,00:23:51,"It started his fighting weight, though, isn't it, at that stage?"
00:23:51,00:23:52,Exactly.
00:23:52,00:23:55,"So the three of them went, and then the three survived, but Cherry Garrod got back, and"
00:23:55,00:24:00,"he was so ill from this expedition that he didn't go on the bit to the south pole, which"
00:24:00,00:24:03,is where Fowers and Wilson died with Scott.
00:24:03,00:24:04,Right.
00:24:04,00:24:07,"But they did get the penguin eggs, but I mean, it sounds extraordinary."
00:24:07,00:24:12,"So Cherry's teeth shattered so violently with the cold that they shattered, apparently."
00:24:12,00:24:14,Do you know how they kept warm as well?
00:24:14,00:24:15,How?
00:24:15,00:24:16,By burning penguins.
00:24:16,00:24:17,That's dark.
00:24:17,00:24:18,That's very dark.
00:24:18,00:24:19,How you do what you can.
00:24:19,00:24:24,"I thought you'd say they had a lovely hug and a cuddle together, and now, oh, I'm not"
00:24:24,00:24:28,"hugging you, I'm going to burn this penguin."
00:24:28,00:24:31,"I mean, that was when they went to the colony."
00:24:31,00:24:36,"They grabbed a whole bunch of eggs, and they took some adult males, and they burnt them,"
00:24:36,00:24:37,because they're really oily.
00:24:37,00:24:38,Yeah.
00:24:38,00:24:40,"I was going to say, like, scuers, they burn quite well, don't they?"
00:24:40,00:24:41,How do they?
00:24:41,00:24:42,They use those as lamps in Scotland.
00:24:42,00:24:43,"Oh, they stick it."
00:24:43,00:24:44,"Yeah, they stick a wick up there."
00:24:44,00:24:45,But yeah.
00:24:45,00:24:50,"I mean, how strong are your ethical principles when you are near the south pole, and suddenly"
00:24:50,00:24:52,you realise it's death or penguin burning?
00:24:52,00:24:53,In the name.
00:24:53,00:24:54,It was a couple of penguins.
00:24:54,00:24:55,Yeah.
00:24:55,00:25:00,"It was, so it took him 45 minutes each night to chip into his frozen sleeping bag."
00:25:00,00:25:04,"They probably burnt, like, the novels that they brought with them in the finish before"
00:25:04,00:25:06,they burnt the penguin.
00:25:06,00:25:07,"Yeah, probably."
00:25:07,00:25:10,"I mean, not the dickens, because you need to keep holding the best ones."
00:25:10,00:25:13,"Sorry, it took 45 minutes to chip into his sleeping bag."
00:25:13,00:25:16,"Each night it would be a block of ice, and he said 45 minutes."
00:25:16,00:25:20,And all I've got is one of these pieces of my own tooth to chip away with.
00:25:20,00:25:21,"Oh, my God."
00:25:21,00:25:22,That sounds...
00:25:22,00:25:23,Yeah.
00:25:23,00:25:24,"Well, I'm going to bed."
00:25:24,00:25:25,You're going to bed early.
00:25:25,00:25:26,Yeah.
00:25:26,00:25:27,"Yeah, I..."
00:25:27,00:25:28,Got the old sleeping bag chipping to do.
00:25:28,00:25:32,"There was also a thing where they had three sleds, I think, but they could only pull one"
00:25:32,00:25:33,at a time.
00:25:33,00:25:37,"So for every sort of mile they travelled, they had to do three back and forth."
00:25:37,00:25:38,"Oh, my God."
00:25:38,00:25:39,"Oh, my God."
00:25:39,00:25:42,And they couldn't leave the chicken on the sled at the same time as the crane.
00:25:42,00:25:50,"I think we've got a penguin, an octopus, and a dolphin."
00:25:50,00:25:59,"OK, it is time for fact number three, and that is Andy."
00:25:59,00:26:03,"My fact is that when Queen Elizabeth II got married, the people of Levington Spa clubbed"
00:26:03,00:26:05,together and bought her a washing machine.
00:26:05,00:26:06,Oh.
00:26:06,00:26:07,Yeah.
00:26:07,00:26:08,That's nice.
00:26:08,00:26:09,It's very nice.
00:26:09,00:26:10,Clumped together?
00:26:10,00:26:13,"How expensive was the washing machine, or how little did each individual in Levington"
00:26:13,00:26:14,Spa contribute?
00:26:14,00:26:15,Wow.
00:26:15,00:26:16,Wow.
00:26:16,00:26:18,"Well, I'm sorry, but that's less than one penny, just isn't it?"
00:26:18,00:26:20,Why do you take in everyone?
00:26:20,00:26:23,"I'm sure they were more expensive in 1947, I guess."
00:26:23,00:26:24,Yeah.
00:26:24,00:26:25,Yeah.
00:26:25,00:26:29,"It was also a time famously of massive deprivation after the war, and bread was rationed at this"
00:26:29,00:26:30,point.
00:26:30,00:26:33,They all used their ration cards to buy her a washing machine.
00:26:33,00:26:34,Did she have one already?
00:26:34,00:26:35,Unclear.
00:26:35,00:26:38,"I think out of diplomacy, she was a famously diplomatic woman."
00:26:38,00:26:42,"She would never have said, ""I actually have 16 washing machines in my different houses"
00:26:42,00:26:43,"everywhere."""
00:26:43,00:26:44,Yeah.
00:26:44,00:26:48,"So she was Princess Elizabeth at the time, because she wasn't yet Queen."
00:26:48,00:26:50,That's how it works.
00:26:50,00:26:54,"And 1947, post-war, really poor time."
00:26:54,00:26:57,"So lots of gifts were food, you know?"
00:26:57,00:26:58,Wow.
00:26:58,00:26:59,And gifts from around the world.
00:26:59,00:27:04,"She got given lots of dresses, most of which she gave away to other girls getting married"
00:27:04,00:27:06,around her age around the same time.
00:27:06,00:27:07,That's cool.
00:27:07,00:27:08,Yeah.
00:27:08,00:27:12,"The list of wedding presents, this is so weird, was published as a book, and you can buy it"
00:27:12,00:27:16,"today, and I have ordered it, and it hasn't been delivered yet."
00:27:16,00:27:20,"So tune in next week, we're going to be doing the same thing again."
00:27:20,00:27:21,Wow.
00:27:21,00:27:22,Yeah.
00:27:22,00:27:25,"But it's just weird present, like 500 cases of tin pineapple?"
00:27:25,00:27:28,Can you guys do that much pineapple in your life?
00:27:28,00:27:29,I don't think I could.
00:27:29,00:27:30,"No, I mean either."
00:27:30,00:27:31,There's the Governor of Queensland sent that.
00:27:31,00:27:32,I haven't had one tin this year.
00:27:32,00:27:33,Haven't you?
00:27:33,00:27:34,No.
00:27:34,00:27:35,Gosh.
00:27:35,00:27:36,Maybe after this.
00:27:36,00:27:37,Would you?
00:27:37,00:27:40,I think I had my first tin pineapple of the year yesterday.
00:27:40,00:27:41,That is a coincidence.
00:27:41,00:27:42,Wow.
00:27:42,00:27:43,Isn't it?
00:27:43,00:27:44,That bizarre.
00:27:44,00:27:46,"Yes, it was part of a Panang curry."
00:27:46,00:27:52,"People sent her stockings, which I find quite a personal thing to send someone."
00:27:52,00:27:55,"And she got over 100 pairs, I think, hundreds of pairs of nylon stockings, which were a high-value"
00:27:55,00:27:59,item nylon was a newly invented thing.
00:27:59,00:28:03,"What would the equivalent be to Bitcoin, probably?"
00:28:03,00:28:12,The people of Lemmington Spa chip together to get you one dogecoin.
00:28:12,00:28:16,"Royal wedding gifts are often quite weird, aren't they?"
00:28:16,00:28:21,"Grace Kelly, friend of the podcast, she got a yacht for a nice gift."
00:28:21,00:28:22,Oh yeah.
00:28:22,00:28:23,"Yes, please."
00:28:23,00:28:26,"Yeah, which village clumped together to buy it?"
00:28:26,00:28:27,Yeah.
00:28:27,00:28:28,"It's better than washing machine, isn't it?"
00:28:28,00:28:31,The interesting thing about that is it was a repurposed ship.
00:28:31,00:28:37,"It was a yacht, and then it got turned into a ship for the war, and was used at Dunkirk"
00:28:37,00:28:40,to help evacuate soldiers.
00:28:40,00:28:44,"And then after the war, Anasis bought it again and turned it back into a yacht, and then gave"
00:28:44,00:28:46,it to Grace Kelly as a wedding gift.
00:28:46,00:28:49,"That's sort of recycling, sort of."
00:28:49,00:28:54,"Sorry, which bin does this yacht go in?"
00:28:54,00:28:56,"Oh, that's great."
00:28:56,00:28:58,That's much better than the one I felt.
00:28:58,00:29:02,"Prince Charles and Diana, when they got married, a council in Somerset said, ""One tonne of"
00:29:02,00:29:03,"peat."""
00:29:03,00:29:04,Oh.
00:29:04,00:29:09,"He's a farmer, and you know, he's not a farmer as he, but he owns lots of farmers."
00:29:09,00:29:12,"Yeah, but do you know that was a huge faux pas, really?"
00:29:12,00:29:13,Oh yeah.
00:29:13,00:29:16,Sending excrement to a wedding is not a faux pas.
00:29:16,00:29:17,"Oh, peat isn't excrement."
00:29:17,00:29:18,It's not excrement.
00:29:18,00:29:19,I need to do some basic lessons.
00:29:19,00:29:20,It is.
00:29:20,00:29:21,It was Sedgemoor District Council.
00:29:21,00:29:24,"They sent him a tonne of peat, and this was exactly about the time that Charles was banning"
00:29:24,00:29:28,"peat, because he is very environmentally aware and has been for a very long time."
00:29:28,00:29:33,"And in the ATC banned peat use on all of his farms, because, you know, it's a big biodiversity"
00:29:33,00:29:34,area now.
00:29:34,00:29:35,"Yeah, peat-free compost all that."
00:29:35,00:29:36,Yeah.
00:29:36,00:29:38,"Also, it sequesters a lot of carbon, doesn't it?"
00:29:38,00:29:39,Yeah.
00:29:39,00:29:42,"Yes, although he knew that at the time, but he was very, you know, he predicted."
00:29:42,00:29:45,"So, Sedgemoor, he screwed up, and that's..."
00:29:45,00:29:49,One nice wedding gift I found is something that people get in Japan called the Venus
00:29:49,00:29:50,Flower Basket.
00:29:50,00:29:51,"Oh, yes."
00:29:51,00:29:52,Do you know it?
00:29:52,00:29:53,"I know this one, yeah."
00:29:53,00:29:54,Go on.
00:29:54,00:29:55,Tell us what it is.
00:29:55,00:30:00,"So, it's a deep sea sponge that's a glass sponge that they made out of kind of silica,"
00:30:00,00:30:01,basically.
00:30:01,00:30:06,"They look like a very ornate stocking, so a bit sort of like a woven knitted stocking."
00:30:06,00:30:10,"And then there are these shrimp that live inside them, and they get inside them when"
00:30:10,00:30:14,"they're larvae, so they can sort of go through the holes of this glassy sponge thing."
00:30:14,00:30:18,"And then they get trapped, and so, basically, you have a male and a female that are trapped"
00:30:18,00:30:20,inside this sponge and can't get out.
00:30:20,00:30:23,And that's like a marriage.
00:30:23,00:30:24,Exactly.
00:30:24,00:30:25,Exactly.
00:30:25,00:30:28,"And they send their babies off into the world through the holes of their sponge, but they"
00:30:28,00:30:30,stay their entire life inside this sponge.
00:30:30,00:30:31,"Yeah, it is that."
00:30:31,00:30:34,"It's because, like, the male and the female stay together the rest of their lives, isn't"
00:30:34,00:30:35,it?
00:30:35,00:30:37,"Well, it's a claustrophobic concept of marriage, isn't it?"
00:30:37,00:30:42,"Well, I also found this, like, because it's like this glass sponge is like in a framework,"
00:30:42,00:30:43,isn't it?
00:30:43,00:30:44,It's like a lattice.
00:30:44,00:30:49,"They found that the currents go into it, and they create, like, a little vortex, and it"
00:30:49,00:30:54,"means that when the male and the female release their sperm and eggs, it's the perfect vortex"
00:30:54,00:30:56,to make them all sort of mixed together.
00:30:56,00:30:57,"Oh, cool."
00:30:57,00:30:59,"That's quite romantic as well, isn't it?"
00:30:59,00:31:00,It is.
00:31:00,00:31:01,It's lovely.
00:31:01,00:31:07,"I've heard as well that they designed the gherkin in London around the skyscraper, around this"
00:31:07,00:31:13,"sort of shape of a sponge as well, and it was like, rather than water and other things,"
00:31:13,00:31:14,circulating around it.
00:31:14,00:31:17,"It's for air conditioning, and it pulls the air in, and it goes up the building."
00:31:17,00:31:21,Do not release sperm around the gherkin if you're looking for love.
00:31:21,00:31:23,Just to see what happens.
00:31:23,00:31:29,The building security and the cleaning team will both be the fact.
00:31:29,00:31:30,That's so interesting.
00:31:30,00:31:31,Wow.
00:31:31,00:31:32,That's very cool.
00:31:32,00:31:33,Yeah.
00:31:33,00:31:34,Will you do a washing machine thing or two?
00:31:34,00:31:35,"No, washing machines."
00:31:35,00:31:36,Yeah.
00:31:36,00:31:37,They're bad.
00:31:37,00:31:38,Are they?
00:31:38,00:31:40,"Yeah, washing machines are bad."
00:31:40,00:31:47,"Classic cloth washing accounts for 35% of primary microplastics found in the environment, and"
00:31:47,00:31:52,they're trying to come up with a law where all new washing machines have to have a filter
00:31:52,00:31:53,in them.
00:31:53,00:31:57,"It's already the law in France, I think, but at the moment it's not the law in the UK,"
00:31:57,00:31:59,and it needs to be the law in the UK.
00:31:59,00:32:02,Does that stop the microplastics getting out and into the water system?
00:32:02,00:32:03,Yeah.
00:32:03,00:32:04,"That's a filter, yeah."
00:32:04,00:32:06,"When you say synthetic fabrics, I've got a ..."
00:32:06,00:32:09,"That T-shirt you're wearing, I would say ... Oh, it's cotton, I guess."
00:32:09,00:32:14,"No, I think you're talking more like fleeces and ... Yeah, like polyester."
00:32:14,00:32:15,Polyester.
00:32:15,00:32:16,"Oh, okay."
00:32:16,00:32:19,Polyester fleeces are particularly bad because they just shed loads of fibres.
00:32:19,00:32:21,Why would you ever wash a fleece?
00:32:21,00:32:22,"I mean, a good point."
00:32:22,00:32:23,I think you don't.
00:32:23,00:32:24,"You don't, really."
00:32:24,00:32:25,Next time don't.
00:32:25,00:32:29,"I'm at the school of like, if it's an outer layer, you never wash it."
00:32:29,00:32:30,No.
00:32:30,00:32:31,Unless you've fallen a swamp.
00:32:31,00:32:32,"Oh, yeah."
00:32:32,00:32:35,"And if you're wearing your fleece, you might be ... What if a bird poo's on you?"
00:32:35,00:32:36,"Oh, yeah."
00:32:36,00:32:37,Just wipe it.
00:32:37,00:32:40,"Wait until it's dry and then a stiff, ah, hog's back with a brush."
00:32:40,00:32:41,"Yeah, honestly."
00:32:41,00:32:45,Do you know that the first fleeces were called synthetic chinchillas?
00:32:45,00:32:46,"No, stop it."
00:32:46,00:32:47,"Yeah, yeah."
00:32:47,00:32:48,I think that's right.
00:32:48,00:32:49,When was that?
00:32:49,00:32:50,When.
00:32:50,00:32:51,"Yeah, roughly."
00:32:51,00:32:52,20th century.
00:32:52,00:32:53,Get away.
00:32:53,00:32:54,"20th century, yeah."
00:32:54,00:32:55,"Because before that, people were wearing chinchillas."
00:32:55,00:32:56,Real chinchilla.
00:32:56,00:32:57,Yeah.
00:32:57,00:33:01,I think chinchilla was a name of a fabric that was kind of similar to what a chinchilla
00:33:01,00:33:04,"was, but it was like, it was made of cotton, but it was called chinchilla."
00:33:04,00:33:05,That's funny.
00:33:05,00:33:06,And then there's the synthetic chinchilla.
00:33:06,00:33:07,I think that's right.
00:33:07,00:33:08,That's amazing.
00:33:08,00:33:10,"I run it because actually they're sort of chin-warmers, aren't they?"
00:33:10,00:33:11,That's very right.
00:33:11,00:33:12,Yeah.
00:33:12,00:33:13,Gas.
00:33:13,00:33:14,Gas.
00:33:14,00:33:15,Good grief.
00:33:15,00:33:16,Can I tell you a washing machine fact?
00:33:16,00:33:17,Yeah.
00:33:17,00:33:18,Sure.
00:33:18,00:33:19,This is good.
00:33:19,00:33:20,So you know the Samsung jingle?
00:33:20,00:33:21,The Samsung jingle.
00:33:21,00:33:22,No?
00:33:22,00:33:23,That's not one of the things.
00:33:23,00:33:25,"When you're washing machine finishes, it plays a little tune."
00:33:25,00:33:26,Samsung.
00:33:26,00:33:27,Is this the Samsung?
00:33:27,00:33:28,Yeah.
00:33:28,00:33:29,"No, I don't know it."
00:33:29,00:33:30,"Yeah, there's a tune."
00:33:30,00:33:31,"Well, lots of washing machines."
00:33:31,00:33:33,"My washing machine just goes beep, beep, beep, and it's finished."
00:33:33,00:33:36,"Does it go dum, dum, dum, or something like that?"
00:33:36,00:33:37,Nope.
00:33:37,00:33:38,No.
00:33:38,00:33:39,That's an announcement on the underground.
00:33:39,00:33:40,I think.
00:33:40,00:33:41,Yeah.
00:33:41,00:33:44,I installed the wrong thing in my kitchen.
00:33:44,00:33:49,"Is the one that goes dum, dum, dum, dum, dum, dum, dum, dum, dum, dum, dum, dum, dum,"
00:33:49,00:33:50,"dum, dum, dum, dum."
00:33:50,00:33:51,Really?
00:33:51,00:33:52,Really?
00:33:52,00:33:53,I don't know.
00:33:53,00:33:54,"And it's really long, right?"
00:33:54,00:33:55,So this is so mad.
00:33:55,00:33:56,It was composed in 1817.
00:33:56,00:33:57,The Samsung washing machine jingle.
00:33:57,00:33:58,For this.
00:33:58,00:33:59,For this in mind.
00:33:59,00:34:00,For this.
00:34:00,00:34:01,It's Franz Schubert.
00:34:01,00:34:02,Wow.
00:34:02,00:34:03,I know.
00:34:03,00:34:04,It's a song.
00:34:04,00:34:05,It's called The Trout.
00:34:05,00:34:06,So there's an aquatic theme.
00:34:06,00:34:07,"Oh, OK."
00:34:07,00:34:11,"And it's based on a poem, a different, confusingly, a German writer called Schubert."
00:34:11,00:34:12,Wow.
00:34:12,00:34:17,"And it's about a trout that gets caught by a fisherman, and it's a warning to young women"
00:34:17,00:34:19,to stay away from men.
00:34:19,00:34:20,"Well, there you are."
00:34:20,00:34:21,Yeah.
00:34:21,00:34:25,"And this is the tune that is in every Samsung washing machine, and it's a little sort of"
00:34:25,00:34:28,"ceremonial ditty that plays at the end of, and I have one of those washing machines."
00:34:28,00:34:31,I hear that tune a couple of times a week.
00:34:31,00:34:35,Your wife leaves the house.
00:34:35,00:34:38,What a multi-layered fact there are so many bits to grasp there.
00:34:38,00:34:41,"Well, I mean, to start off with, I didn't know Samsung made washing machines."
00:34:41,00:34:43,I thought they made TVs.
00:34:43,00:34:44,Right.
00:34:44,00:34:45,That's the foothills of this fact.
00:34:45,00:34:46,Yeah.
00:34:46,00:34:47,Schubert and Schubert.
00:34:47,00:34:51,I want to know about that comedy double up.
00:34:51,00:34:53,Can I ask you guys a question about your washing machines?
00:34:53,00:34:56,How much washing powder do you tend to put in?
00:34:56,00:35:00,"I just put one of those, like, you know, those tide pod things that Americans eat."
00:35:00,00:35:01,I put one of those.
00:35:01,00:35:04,"Oh, you do the tide pod."
00:35:04,00:35:05,"Yeah, just a scoop."
00:35:05,00:35:06,I don't use powder.
00:35:06,00:35:07,I use liquid.
00:35:07,00:35:08,Nice.
00:35:08,00:35:10,From a refill shop.
00:35:10,00:35:11,Well done.
00:35:11,00:35:12,For the on message.
00:35:12,00:35:13,"Yeah, just a cup of that."
00:35:13,00:35:14,"Oh, okay."
00:35:14,00:35:15,A lid.
00:35:15,00:35:20,"Good, but I'm afraid it's not quite as good as the old reusable egg full of dry granules"
00:35:20,00:35:21,that I use.
00:35:21,00:35:22,Oh!
00:35:22,00:35:23,I've got one of those.
00:35:23,00:35:26,"You do have to fly down to the Antarctic to get the egg, don't you?"
00:35:26,00:35:31,That's why I've lost all these teeth in front teeth of mine.
00:35:31,00:35:32,Is that right?
00:35:32,00:35:33,You wash with a reusable egg.
00:35:33,00:35:37,"There's a little plastic egg, which is full of dry granules, and they last about, like,"
00:35:37,00:35:40,"a hundred washes or something, and you just replace those dry granules."
00:35:40,00:35:42,I wondered why you spelt so bad.
00:35:42,00:35:44,"Like, it works, it's really good."
00:35:44,00:35:49,"That's a much better public service announcement than mine, which is if you're just using normal"
00:35:49,00:35:54,"washing powder, you should never need to use more than really a tablespoon, which is much,"
00:35:54,00:35:56,much less than you're probably using.
00:35:56,00:36:00,"This is a New York Times expose, and it's really bad to overuse it because it makes your clothes"
00:36:00,00:36:01,go all crunchy.
00:36:01,00:36:06,"Can I ask Anna, as someone who has a toddler who's currently potty training, and so I often"
00:36:06,00:36:11,"have urine and feces stains on my clothing, is it different for me?"
00:36:11,00:36:15,"It says for extremely heavy loads, you might want two tablespoons, but you're never going"
00:36:15,00:36:17,to need more than that.
00:36:17,00:36:18,Thank you.
00:36:18,00:36:21,"And they're lying to you, the companies, with their cups on the list because they just want"
00:36:21,00:36:22,to get through it.
00:36:22,00:36:23,"Exactly, and they keep a little scoop, don't they?"
00:36:23,00:36:24,"Oh, it's in their interest."
00:36:24,00:36:25,Yeah.
00:36:25,00:36:26,There you go.
00:36:26,00:36:27,"Big core, big powder."
00:36:27,00:36:31,"But, because I've always thought the whole thing's a scam, and what I've always thought"
00:36:31,00:36:34,"is the whole washing clothes thing, it's a scam."
00:36:34,00:36:37,"The thing I've always thought is the drawer thing, got to be a scam, so I've always put"
00:36:37,00:36:38,everything in the drum.
00:36:38,00:36:39,"Yeah, I do that as well."
00:36:39,00:36:43,"Well, what I've realized, if you use fabric softener, if you put that in the drum, which"
00:36:43,00:36:48,"I always have done, it's completely pointless, and it's because it's to do with the charging"
00:36:48,00:36:49,of it.
00:36:49,00:36:52,"So fabric softener is partly there to stop your static clothes sticking together, and"
00:36:52,00:36:56,it does that by being positively charged so that the negatively charged clothes bind with
00:36:56,00:36:58,it and become neutralized.
00:36:58,00:37:03,"So there you go, that's kind of what it does, but it has the opposite charge to your washing"
00:37:03,00:37:07,"powder, so if you put them in at the same time in the drum, they cancel each other out,"
00:37:07,00:37:09,and it doesn't do any good.
00:37:09,00:37:14,"So if you are like me, and you're just tipping your fabric softener in the drum, stop it,"
00:37:14,00:37:16,and stop using all of it and be more ethical like these guys.
00:37:16,00:37:17,Get the egg.
00:37:17,00:37:18,Get the plaster.
00:37:18,00:37:19,"I swear, get the egg in the granules."
00:37:19,00:37:20,Get the giant penguin egg.
00:37:20,00:37:21,Yeah.
00:37:21,00:37:22,Get it in the washing machine.
00:37:22,00:37:23,Yeah.
00:37:23,00:37:24,Wow.
00:37:24,00:37:25,Yeah.
00:37:25,00:37:26,I'm going to study one wedding present thing.
00:37:26,00:37:31,"So it's based on a fact I discovered, which is that in 2015, Cristiano Ronaldo bought his"
00:37:31,00:37:36,"agent, George Mendes and his wife, Sandra, Greek Island as the present."
00:37:36,00:37:37,So they're best friends.
00:37:37,00:37:39,"I think he was best man at his wedding, or vice versa."
00:37:39,00:37:43,"So they're very close, health sweet, bought in the Greek Island, and I was just like,"
00:37:43,00:37:45,how do you buy someone a Greek Island?
00:37:45,00:37:51,"And do you know this website called privateislandsonline.com, which just has loads of islands for"
00:37:51,00:37:52,sale.
00:37:52,00:37:56,"And this, when Greece went through the credit crunch, I didn't realise, but lots of economists"
00:37:56,00:38:00,"advise, and eventually they went with it, advise that they put up a bunch of their islands"
00:38:00,00:38:02,for sale to make back some of the money.
00:38:02,00:38:04,"I have been on this website, I think."
00:38:04,00:38:06,Have you got an island?
00:38:06,00:38:12,"No, I think like if memory serves, you go on, and it's like some of them are like not beyond"
00:38:12,00:38:16,"the realms of possibility of someone like me could buy, but it's always like a tiny island"
00:38:16,00:38:24,"in a lock, in the northernmost part of Scotland, and it says no electricity, no water, no ability"
00:38:24,00:38:25,to get to the island.
00:38:25,00:38:30,"Well, you know, you'd be living a little bit off-grid, yes, but I still think the cheapest"
00:38:30,00:38:33,Greek one I found was five million US dollars.
00:38:33,00:38:35,"So if, you know..."
00:38:35,00:38:36,If we all club together...
00:38:36,00:38:40,"If those bastards in Levington's bar actually chipped in, and dug deep."
00:38:40,00:38:44,"Maybe, I don't know what the mortgage offers are on this."
00:38:44,00:38:48,"It's Strogillo Island, or Strogillo Island, it's got beaches around the edge."
00:38:48,00:38:52,"OK, here we are, no such thing as a fish island."
00:38:52,00:38:56,"Everyone is listening, chips in a bit, and everyone gets to go there."
00:38:56,00:38:57,"OK, lovely."
00:38:57,00:38:58,"I love it, let's do it."
00:38:58,00:39:02,"We can get five million dollars, it's 54 acres, so we could all fit."
00:39:02,00:39:05,Is there anything on it?
00:39:05,00:39:08,"Some trees, it's very green, it's very verdant."
00:39:08,00:39:09,Sounds lovely.
00:39:09,00:39:12,"Oh, and it's got power in some, I mean..."
00:39:12,00:39:13,The power station.
00:39:13,00:39:18,"There is a new clear power station in the middle, and it had a little hiccup a few years ago,"
00:39:18,00:39:20,"but honestly, it's fine."
00:39:20,00:39:22,"It's fine, it's fine."
00:39:22,00:39:25,"Anyway, just something to bear in mind, I think."
00:39:25,00:39:27,"Yes, get that kickstart to go."
00:39:27,00:39:28,"Yeah, I think I will."
00:39:28,00:39:29,Get an island.
00:39:29,00:39:30,Lovely.
00:39:30,00:39:32,"Can I do animal gifts, wedding gifts?"
00:39:32,00:39:35,Can we do this quickly?
00:39:35,00:39:38,"Technically known as not-pretty-all-gifts, and there are lots of animals that give each"
00:39:38,00:39:40,other a presence before mating.
00:39:40,00:39:43,Did you know about this?
00:39:43,00:39:49,"So, usually the males, occasionally it's females that offer something, and it's usually food."
00:39:49,00:39:53,But the really cool one I found was the nursery web spider.
00:39:53,00:39:57,"So the males approach the female and give her a gift of usually an insect, and he wraps"
00:39:57,00:39:59,them up in silk.
00:39:59,00:40:05,"And the females prefer the wrapped ones, they like the white, shiny, wrapped-up presents."
00:40:05,00:40:09,"But he'll give her the present, and she will open it and start eating it."
00:40:09,00:40:13,"And meanwhile, he's getting busy with what he needs to do, so they start mating while"
00:40:13,00:40:18,"she's opening her present right there, and generally-"
00:40:18,00:40:19,She's awake.
00:40:19,00:40:21,You just wait until I'm awake.
00:40:21,00:40:22,"No, no."
00:40:22,00:40:23,It's sort of the whole point.
00:40:23,00:40:24,And if she can-
00:40:24,00:40:25,At least sing happy birthday.
00:40:25,00:40:26,"No, no."
00:40:26,00:40:27,He's mating while she's-
00:40:27,00:40:32,"So she's opening the present, but basically, because it's wrapped up, he can cheat, and"
00:40:32,00:40:34,they don't always put something inside.
00:40:34,00:40:35,No way.
00:40:35,00:40:36,That's so funny.
00:40:36,00:40:37,It's like deal or no deal.
00:40:37,00:40:38,"Yeah, yeah."
00:40:38,00:40:43,"So basically, some of them are like, ""Well, I'll just put this whole piece of shit in"
00:40:43,00:40:44,"here."""
00:40:44,00:40:46,"No one's going to know until she's opened it, because it takes a bit of time."
00:40:46,00:40:50,"And if she opens it and she's like, ""What is the-"" Okay."
00:40:50,00:40:51,And then basically-
00:40:51,00:40:52,Too late.
00:40:52,00:40:53,Too late.
00:40:53,00:40:54,I've done enough.
00:40:54,00:40:55,Yeah.
00:40:55,00:40:56,"And so then she'll be like, ""No, off you get."
00:40:56,00:40:57,"We're going now."""
00:40:57,00:40:58,But the male-
00:40:58,00:40:59,They also do a thing where-
00:40:59,00:41:00,"So Hickton, I mean, this is from the paper, actually."
00:41:00,00:41:03,"There's a study of this, and I just thought this is a lovely sentence."
00:41:03,00:41:08,"However, if the female moves and attempts to terminate the copulation, the male may"
00:41:08,00:41:12,"perform Thanatosis, which is death-thaining behavior."
00:41:12,00:41:15,"He stretches out his legs, which is unique to this species."
00:41:15,00:41:22,"The male then ends the insertion and grasps the gift with his chelicerae, which was like"
00:41:22,00:41:23,mouth parts.
00:41:23,00:41:27,"And then the female moves away while holding onto the gift, and the male is dragged along"
00:41:27,00:41:34,"behind the female until eventually she'll give up, and then he revives and resumes"
00:41:34,00:41:35,mating.
00:41:35,00:41:36,Wait.
00:41:36,00:41:39,"Okay, I was going to ask what his end game is here, because I thought he was just trying"
00:41:39,00:41:40,to get the present back.
00:41:40,00:41:41,"Yeah, me too."
00:41:41,00:41:42,Do we gift it?
00:41:42,00:41:44,"Well, I don't think we really know."
00:41:44,00:41:49,"I mean, his end game is to basically try and make it as long as possible, because the"
00:41:49,00:41:52,"longer they go, the more chance they have of fertilizing."
00:41:52,00:41:53,And so basically breaking-
00:41:53,00:41:56,"Like, giving her a crap present is not a great idea, because she will be like, ""No,"
00:41:56,00:41:58,"I'm going to stop now because there's nothing in here."""
00:41:58,00:42:01,"And the better the present you get, the more time, but it seems that sometimes they just"
00:42:01,00:42:04,"don't have anything, or they're really hungry, and they eat the gift first, so they take"
00:42:04,00:42:08,"the insect, they eat it."
00:42:08,00:42:12,"Honestly, I did buy you a bottle of wine, but it was a long-training journey."
00:42:12,00:42:14,"Anyway, here's the bottle."
00:42:14,00:42:15,Exactly.
00:42:15,00:42:17,"Hannah, stop mixing with me."
00:42:17,00:42:21,And you never invited me back.
00:42:21,00:42:29,"Hannah fainting death to me, slunching the white bottle in her mouth."
00:42:29,00:42:37,"OK, it's time for our final fact, and that is James."
00:42:37,00:42:42,"OK, my fact this week is that hermit crabs are facing a housing crisis."
00:42:42,00:42:43,Join the club.
00:42:43,00:42:44,"Oh, this is so sad."
00:42:44,00:42:45,"Sorry, Belle, everyone."
00:42:45,00:42:46,"Dink, dink, dink."
00:42:46,00:42:47,What do you mean?
00:42:47,00:42:58,"I think it's relatively self-explanatory in that hermit crabs, as you might know, don't"
00:42:58,00:43:03,"have their own shells, so they go and find a new shell, and usually it's one that's discarded."
00:43:03,00:43:06,But it turns out that there aren't as many shells as there used to be.
00:43:06,00:43:08,There's various different reasons.
00:43:08,00:43:15,"One reason is because gastropods, shell creatures are shrinking, the populations are shrinking."
00:43:15,00:43:21,But the paper's basically analysed photographs of crabs online and found--
00:43:21,00:43:23,Social media pictures of hermit crabs.
00:43:23,00:43:24,"Pretty much, yeah."
00:43:24,00:43:29,"They basically went onto Instagram and looked for hermit crabs, and found loads of pictures"
00:43:29,00:43:32,"of them using bottle caps, soda cans, Lego bricks."
00:43:32,00:43:38,"A really scary bit is the broken end of a light bulb, so the metal bit that you screw"
00:43:38,00:43:40,"in, they used that."
00:43:40,00:43:41,Yeah.
00:43:41,00:43:44,It's quite a few pictures of hermit crabs.
00:43:44,00:43:48,"I guess those are very durable in the ocean, I suppose, as they just last a lot of time,"
00:43:48,00:43:49,don't they?
00:43:49,00:43:52,"I think that's one of the other reasons they're doing it, just because it's what's there."
00:43:52,00:43:53,Right.
00:43:53,00:43:54,Yeah.
00:43:54,00:43:57,And there was another study in 2019 that found that half a million hermit crabs are dying
00:43:57,00:44:00,every year after getting stuck inside bottles and things like that.
00:44:00,00:44:02,So it's bad news for hermit crabs.
00:44:02,00:44:03,It is.
00:44:03,00:44:05,"I mean, it's kind of mad."
00:44:05,00:44:11,"Apparently as well, this plastic starts to smell like dead crabs, and that's one reason"
00:44:11,00:44:12,why they come towards them.
00:44:12,00:44:16,"So there's this stuff called dimethyl sulfide, which is this molecule that does all sorts"
00:44:16,00:44:20,"of important things like make clouds, and it comes off plankton in the ocean."
00:44:20,00:44:25,"But it also, it's like, it's the smell of a rotting crab, but it sticks to the outside"
00:44:25,00:44:27,"of plastic stuff, plastic pollution in the ocean."
00:44:27,00:44:33,"So one reason, possibly, why these crabs are going for the Coke bottle lids and yogurt"
00:44:33,00:44:36,"pots is because they think it smells like a dead crab, and therefore it's a shell that's"
00:44:36,00:44:39,just been left behind by another crab.
00:44:39,00:44:40,Because you would use that naturally.
00:44:40,00:44:41,"Yeah, yeah, exactly."
00:44:41,00:44:43,So the thermocrabs will use whatever they can find.
00:44:43,00:44:48,"So in Madagascar, there was a beach where there's a big cliff full of fossil shells,"
00:44:48,00:44:52,"so really old shells, and the crabs will wait at the bottom of the cliff, waiting for the"
00:44:52,00:44:56,"fossils to drop out, and then they will use those as their home."
00:44:56,00:44:57,That's so cool.
00:44:57,00:45:01,"That's like buying like a period property, like a listed building."
00:45:01,00:45:03,They're not allowed to decorate though.
00:45:03,00:45:04,"No, no, no."
00:45:04,00:45:05,That's amazing.
00:45:05,00:45:08,So they will use all sorts of things.
00:45:08,00:45:12,It's really interesting what you said about how they'll go towards the smell of a dead
00:45:12,00:45:16,"crab, because obviously in nature that's very unusual, isn't it?"
00:45:16,00:45:20,"Like usually if a member of your species has died, you would usually give that a bit of"
00:45:20,00:45:21,a wide berth.
00:45:21,00:45:23,"Yeah, unless you want to eat it."
00:45:23,00:45:26,"Well, yeah, which is what they do, I think, as well, right?"
00:45:26,00:45:27,They might do.
00:45:27,00:45:28,"But yeah, you're right."
00:45:28,00:45:29,It's not a good smell.
00:45:29,00:45:30,"Like carrion, rotting carrion is not."
00:45:30,00:45:35,"So what happens is that sometimes they'll climb into a bottle, and because the bottle's"
00:45:35,00:45:36,"smooth, they can't get out."
00:45:36,00:45:37,So they'll die.
00:45:37,00:45:42,"And then the smell of the dead crab comes out, and then the next crab goes, oh, great."
00:45:42,00:45:44,"Dead crab goes into the bottle, and then they get stuck."
00:45:44,00:45:46,"Oh, no, it's like a horror film."
00:45:46,00:45:49,"And then the next crab goes to find that dead crab, and then you've got a bottle full of"
00:45:49,00:45:50,dead crabs.
00:45:50,00:45:51,"Oh, God."
00:45:51,00:45:55,And another kind of crazy thing about this is that maybe it's actually kind of makes
00:45:55,00:45:59,"sense from the crab's point of view, because if there's a ton of plastic around and you"
00:45:59,00:46:03,"want to hide, then you hide inside the plastic."
00:46:03,00:46:08,And then predators might also not really have figured out that there might be crabs inside
00:46:08,00:46:09,of yoghurt pots.
00:46:09,00:46:12,And so they haven't kind of learned yet to go looking.
00:46:12,00:46:15,So it could be actually an advantage for the crabs.
00:46:15,00:46:16,And they're also lighter.
00:46:16,00:46:17,Yeah.
00:46:17,00:46:18,As a shell.
00:46:18,00:46:19,"Yeah, they're all pretty flue."
00:46:19,00:46:20,They take almost no energy to pick up.
00:46:20,00:46:21,They're all really clever.
00:46:21,00:46:24,"They sort of, the way they do it."
00:46:24,00:46:27,So they sometimes evict each other.
00:46:27,00:46:31,So if you have outgrown your shell and you spotted a hermit crab with a shell that would
00:46:31,00:46:36,"be perfect for your current size, they go over and bang on the shell with their claws."
00:46:36,00:46:37,They do.
00:46:37,00:46:39,"And before the fight breaks out, they'll show each other their claws."
00:46:39,00:46:42,"Because if you've got the bigger claws, then generally you're the one who wins."
00:46:42,00:46:43,So they try not to have a fight.
00:46:43,00:46:47,"They'll be like, look, I'm this big, and the other one will, they'll compare claw size."
00:46:47,00:46:49,And that can deflect fights.
00:46:49,00:46:50,That would be good.
00:46:50,00:46:54,"You know, in boxing at the start, before the boxing fight, they always come up to each"
00:46:54,00:46:58,other and sort of like stand head to head and sort of talk to each other.
00:46:58,00:47:01,"It would be good if every time one of them just went, oh, no, I'm going to lose this."
00:47:01,00:47:03,You're way bigger than me.
00:47:03,00:47:05,"Is that the weigh-in, James?"
00:47:05,00:47:06,"Yeah, yeah."
00:47:06,00:47:07,Are they actually weighed at that point?
00:47:07,00:47:08,"Yes, they are."
00:47:08,00:47:11,"Because in most weights, there's a maximum weight you can be, and they try and get as"
00:47:11,00:47:12,close to that as possible.
00:47:12,00:47:14,"And are they both, I've always wondered this about boxing, are they both standing on the"
00:47:14,00:47:15,same set of scales?
00:47:15,00:47:17,Because they're standing right facing each other and looking at each other.
00:47:17,00:47:20,I always wonder if there's one big set of scales in the middle that they both have to
00:47:20,00:47:21,get on.
00:47:21,00:47:25,"As in, like one of those balance scales that goes up and down, and now it's one set of"
00:47:25,00:47:26,scales and they take turns.
00:47:26,00:47:27,"Oh, they do?"
00:47:27,00:47:28,Okay.
00:47:28,00:47:29,You've got to use the same set.
00:47:29,00:47:30,"Oh, sure."
00:47:30,00:47:31,"Yeah, yeah."
00:47:31,00:47:34,"But it would be nice if there was a joint set, and they could both use it at the same time."
00:47:34,00:47:35,And if it goes over the weight.
00:47:35,00:47:36,Just a seesaw.
00:47:36,00:47:37,Exactly.
00:47:37,00:47:38,And it has to be exactly balanced.
00:47:38,00:47:39,Yeah.
00:47:39,00:47:40,"And it would be nice, actually it would be nicer if in the middle of the boxing ring"
00:47:40,00:47:41,was a seesaw.
00:47:41,00:47:42,And whoever wins the seesaw.
00:47:42,00:47:43,How do you win at seesaw?
00:47:43,00:47:44,Do not win.
00:47:44,00:47:45,Yeah.
00:47:45,00:47:46,That was a very competitive trial.
00:47:46,00:47:47,Absolutely.
00:47:47,00:47:52,Crush them on the little springy dogs at the park today.
00:47:52,00:47:56,"Hermit crabs, hermit crabs."
00:47:56,00:47:57,Hermit crabs.
00:47:57,00:48:00,So they do actually decorate their homes quite well.
00:48:00,00:48:04,"And so we've talked about the way they move house, but when they're living in their house,"
00:48:04,00:48:05,they do various things.
00:48:05,00:48:09,The anemone hermit crab gets anemones and sticks them to its shell.
00:48:09,00:48:13,And I think it's because they've got stinging tentacles that affect other passers by.
00:48:13,00:48:14,And so it's a little bit of protection.
00:48:14,00:48:19,"The anemone gets some food, but when they move shells, they do then take all the furniture"
00:48:19,00:48:20,with them.
00:48:20,00:48:21,The flat doesn't come furnished.
00:48:21,00:48:22,So I think they spend ages.
00:48:22,00:48:23,Is this right?
00:48:23,00:48:24,They spent ages prizing off the anemones.
00:48:24,00:48:25,Yeah.
00:48:25,00:48:26,Yeah.
00:48:26,00:48:30,There's a species of deep sea anemone that was discovered just last year.
00:48:30,00:48:32,And they got a couple into the aquarium.
00:48:32,00:48:35,And this was a scientist in Japan.
00:48:35,00:48:37,And it spent two days trying to move the anemone.
00:48:37,00:48:38,Wow.
00:48:38,00:48:39,Yeah.
00:48:39,00:48:41,It was like pinching it and pulling it and like just generally trying to get it to let
00:48:41,00:48:42,go.
00:48:42,00:48:46,And then you've got to persuade it to cling on to the new one as well.
00:48:46,00:48:47,Oh my God.
00:48:47,00:48:48,It just doesn't want to move.
00:48:48,00:48:49,Yeah.
00:48:49,00:48:50,"The anemone, I don't know if it knows."
00:48:50,00:48:51,"But basically just, I don't know."
00:48:51,00:48:52,But it's just not cooperating.
00:48:52,00:48:53,"It just clings on, right?"
00:48:53,00:48:54,It just clings on.
00:48:54,00:48:59,"But the crab is like, well, they might not get another anemone and they're in short supply."
00:48:59,00:49:01,So you have to bring them with you.
00:49:01,00:49:02,Wow.
00:49:02,00:49:03,So great.
00:49:03,00:49:04,Yeah.
00:49:04,00:49:05,That's really amazing.
00:49:05,00:49:06,It's like the worst blue tack ever when you're moving out of a house.
00:49:06,00:49:07,It's scraping away.
00:49:07,00:49:08,Two days.
00:49:08,00:49:09,Yeah.
00:49:09,00:49:10,Why don't I put that poster up?
00:49:10,00:49:11,Have you heard of Aki Inomata?
00:49:11,00:49:12,She's a Japanese artist.
00:49:12,00:49:13,No.
00:49:13,00:49:14,I don't think so.
00:49:14,00:49:20,She does collaborations with animals and one of the animals that she's done an art project
00:49:20,00:49:22,with is a hermit crab.
00:49:22,00:49:23,Okay.
00:49:23,00:49:27,So she's 3D printed miniature cities.
00:49:27,00:49:28,Oh yeah.
00:49:28,00:49:29,Hi CDs.
00:49:29,00:49:35,And she puts the miniature city sort of model she's built on top of a shell and then lets
00:49:35,00:49:37,her hermit crab move into that.
00:49:37,00:49:38,It is cool.
00:49:38,00:49:41,"I mean, I guess it's also not a natural shell, which would be the best thing."
00:49:41,00:49:43,"But it's an interesting, you know."
00:49:43,00:49:44,They won't move into anything.
00:49:44,00:49:48,"Like you give them like make them little Lego homes, they'll move it, they'll try that."
00:49:48,00:49:51,And I looked a bit more into her work Inomata.
00:49:51,00:49:55,"She's done another project, which is called I wear the dog's hair and the dog wears my"
00:49:55,00:49:56,hair.
00:49:56,00:49:57,Okay.
00:49:57,00:50:00,And she and her dog wore capes made from each other's hair.
00:50:00,00:50:01,Okay.
00:50:01,00:50:03,And it looks a lot nicer than you would think it would look.
00:50:03,00:50:04,When you say collaboration.
00:50:04,00:50:07,It was the dog's idea.
00:50:07,00:50:14,"She said, I collected the hair of a dog called Ciello and my own hair over a number of years"
00:50:14,00:50:17,and then make clothes out of my hair for the dog and the dog's hair for myself so we can
00:50:17,00:50:18,exchange coats.
00:50:18,00:50:21,"The two species, human beings and dogs have developed together over the ages."
00:50:21,00:50:24,This work examines the relationship between a human and her pet.
00:50:24,00:50:25,Okay.
00:50:25,00:50:26,What kind of dog was it?
00:50:26,00:50:28,I just want to know what kind of patterning it had.
00:50:28,00:50:29,Small dog.
00:50:29,00:50:30,"Oh, wow."
00:50:30,00:50:31,Was it spotty or stropey or?
00:50:31,00:50:32,"Just brown, I think."
00:50:32,00:50:34,I'm just wondering if it's a small dog.
00:50:34,00:50:36,What kind of outfit you can make really?
00:50:36,00:50:37,It's wearing quite a natty little waistcoat.
00:50:37,00:50:38,It looks good.
00:50:38,00:50:39,Nice.
00:50:39,00:50:42,And she's wearing a kind of cool sleeveless jacket thing.
00:50:42,00:50:45,So the dog's waistcoat is made out of her hair.
00:50:45,00:50:46,That's right.
00:50:46,00:50:48,So why don't we make more clothes out of human hair?
00:50:48,00:50:49,"Yeah, Andy."
00:50:49,00:50:50,That's a good question.
00:50:50,00:50:51,"Oh, I don't know."
00:50:51,00:50:52,Let's do it.
00:50:52,00:50:53,"Well, one creepy, I would say."
00:50:53,00:50:54,Yeah.
00:50:54,00:50:57,"But I mean, you get a lot of, I mean, I guess they use, like, when you get your haircut,"
00:50:57,00:51:01,"like, if it's good hair, they'll use it for making wigs and that's a good wigs."
00:51:01,00:51:02,That's good.
00:51:02,00:51:03,"Well, that's true."
00:51:03,00:51:04,Maybe we do that instead.
00:51:04,00:51:05,I don't know.
00:51:05,00:51:06,I just wondered.
00:51:06,00:51:07,Probably.
00:51:07,00:51:08,"I mean, this woman's a very good artist, it sounds like."
00:51:08,00:51:11,And probably most people who try to make clothes out of human hair would look like shit.
00:51:11,00:51:12,Yeah.
00:51:12,00:51:18,"But if you think of all the head and shoulders you have to put in the washing machine, do"
00:51:18,00:51:22,"you guys know about, I really love historical manias, and I think we often cover them on"
00:51:22,00:51:23,the show.
00:51:23,00:51:27,And I don't think we've talked about conchillomania or conchillomania.
00:51:27,00:51:31,"In the 18th century, people just got really obsessed with collecting shells, didn't they?"
00:51:31,00:51:32,I really did.
00:51:32,00:51:36,And it sounds like a really fun time to be alive and the.
00:51:36,00:51:40,"Ponds, you'll die at 40."
00:51:40,00:51:41,Pros.
00:51:41,00:51:43,Lovely shell collections of conchillomania.
00:51:43,00:51:44,Yeah.
00:51:44,00:51:45,Worth it.
00:51:45,00:51:49,"So, I suppose, like, a lot of these manias, it's a time when people in the Western world"
00:51:49,00:51:53,"or in Europe are exploring more, so they're finding more exciting shells around the world."
00:51:53,00:51:55,The most valued was this one called Glory of the Sea.
00:51:55,00:51:57,Have you seen a Glory of the Sea show?
00:51:57,00:51:58,I have.
00:51:58,00:51:59,Yes.
00:51:59,00:52:00,"They're not that impressive, are they?"
00:52:00,00:52:01,"Well, no, you're right."
00:52:01,00:52:04,"I've seen one that was like, was from that time, and it was collected by Victoria Collectors"
00:52:04,00:52:05,in the Natural History Museum.
00:52:05,00:52:06,"Oh, cool."
00:52:06,00:52:07,Come back.
00:52:07,00:52:13,"But, yeah, it's because no one had one, and so, therefore, you know, the few that existed."
00:52:13,00:52:17,Is that the one where there's a story about someone buying another one?
00:52:17,00:52:22,"He had one already, bought another one at auction, and then immediately smashed it to pieces."
00:52:22,00:52:24,In order to up the value of the first one.
00:52:24,00:52:25,"Yeah, I've heard that story."
00:52:25,00:52:26,And that might just be aproposal.
00:52:26,00:52:28,"I don't know if it's true, but it's that kind of level of me."
00:52:28,00:52:29,It was that vibe.
00:52:29,00:52:30,"Yeah, yeah."
00:52:30,00:52:34,There's definitely one that's sold for three times more than a Vermeer painting at the
00:52:34,00:52:36,same auction.
00:52:36,00:52:40,And then there was this awful moment where we slightly got over the shell collecting
00:52:40,00:52:43,"obsession by the 20th century, but they were still really valuable."
00:52:43,00:52:50,"And I think in 1966, there were only 41 known specimens in the world."
00:52:50,00:52:56,"And then in 1969, we just found this habitat in New Guinea where they all live, and now"
00:52:56,00:52:57,there are tons of them.
00:52:57,00:52:58,"Scuba divers found them, didn't they?"
00:52:58,00:52:59,Yeah.
00:52:59,00:53:00,"I think, yeah."
00:53:00,00:53:03,And there's probably not so many left for hermit crabs now.
00:53:03,00:53:04,"No, that's true."
00:53:04,00:53:06,"Actually, I don't know if they're good for hermit crabs."
00:53:06,00:53:08,They've got quite small openings.
00:53:08,00:53:09,They are very petite.
00:53:09,00:53:10,It would have to.
00:53:10,00:53:11,"It was the very lower end of the housing market, I think."
00:53:11,00:53:12,Yeah.
00:53:12,00:53:13,That's the first time.
00:53:13,00:53:14,Yeah.
00:53:14,00:53:15,You've written a whole book about shells.
00:53:15,00:53:16,I have.
00:53:16,00:53:17,Spirals in Time.
00:53:17,00:53:18,That's correct.
00:53:18,00:53:19,Such a great title.
00:53:19,00:53:20,Thank you.
00:53:20,00:53:21,"Can I ask you, Helen, about periostracum?"
00:53:21,00:53:22,Oh.
00:53:22,00:53:24,I might be saying it wrong.
00:53:24,00:53:28,"I say periostracum, but you know, I'm making that up as well."
00:53:28,00:53:31,"You're an actual expert in this field, so I'm going to go with what you're saying."
00:53:31,00:53:33,"Is it true that shells, this is like a skin?"
00:53:33,00:53:34,Yes.
00:53:34,00:53:35,Shells have skin in life.
00:53:35,00:53:36,Some do.
00:53:36,00:53:37,Yeah.
00:53:37,00:53:39,So it's like a hairy layer that grows on the outside.
00:53:39,00:53:43,"I think it's like a probably camouflage, probably some sort of protective thing that"
00:53:43,00:53:47,makes them look less like a shell and more like a bit of weedy rock.
00:53:47,00:53:48,Yeah.
00:53:48,00:53:49,Yeah.
00:53:49,00:53:53,"All the shells that we see, well, no, like lots of them will have had skin."
00:53:53,00:53:54,"That's weird, isn't it?"
00:53:54,00:53:55,Yeah.
00:53:55,00:53:56,Isn't that weird?
00:53:56,00:53:57,I find it a bit weird.
00:53:57,00:53:58,It's quite weird.
00:53:58,00:53:59,Yeah.
00:53:59,00:54:00,"And then the thing is like cowries, which are really shiny."
00:54:00,00:54:02,"They seem like big, lovely, shiny cowrie shells."
00:54:02,00:54:05,"The reason they're shiny is because part of their body called the mantle, which is like"
00:54:05,00:54:07,the pink bit on a muscle when you eat muscles.
00:54:07,00:54:08,That's the mantle.
00:54:08,00:54:11,"Anyway, it falls over the outside when they're alive, so they cover themselves in like a"
00:54:11,00:54:15,"part of their body, which means they stay nice and shiny and they don't have like stuff"
00:54:15,00:54:16,growing on them.
00:54:16,00:54:21,That's why they are so like porcelain-y kind of shiny glassy.
00:54:21,00:54:24,"Is it porcelain or is the Italian for cowrie shell, I think?"
00:54:24,00:54:25,"Oh, is it?"
00:54:25,00:54:26,Yeah.
00:54:26,00:54:27,Cool.
00:54:27,00:54:28,There you go.
00:54:28,00:54:29,Yeah.
00:54:29,00:54:32,"It was named after the cowrie shell, I think."
00:54:32,00:54:33,"Ooh, that's cool."
00:54:33,00:54:40,And the cowrie shell was named porcelain-er because it reminded people of a pig's vagina.
00:54:40,00:54:43,"Yeah, cowrie's got a lot of that sort of stuff going on."
00:54:43,00:54:45,You can't see that when you picture a cowrie shell.
00:54:45,00:54:46,"I mean, yeah."
00:54:46,00:54:47,I can see it.
00:54:47,00:54:48,First thing that springs to mind.
00:54:48,00:54:53,"If you've only ever seen a cowrie shell or a pig's vagina, basically you've seen them"
00:54:53,00:54:54,both.
00:54:54,00:54:55,I think that's correct.
00:54:55,00:54:56,"Yeah, I would say."
00:54:56,00:54:57,For people at home.
00:54:57,00:55:02,"It's true, Helen, that we don't really know how shells form when animals grow their own"
00:55:02,00:55:03,shells.
00:55:03,00:55:07,"The process of biomineralization, I mean, it's a bit of a mystery."
00:55:07,00:55:10,It's still a bit of a mystery because it's one of those things that takes a very long
00:55:10,00:55:11,time.
00:55:11,00:55:12,I think there's a lot going on.
00:55:12,00:55:15,"There's like a protein scaffold that gets laid down first, I think, and then the calcium"
00:55:15,00:55:18,"carbonate, which is the hard stuff, gets laid down in that."
00:55:18,00:55:20,And it's all at the outer edge of it.
00:55:20,00:55:26,They harvest the calcium ions and carbonate ions from seawater and then combine the two
00:55:26,00:55:30,"of them together and they make crystals of calcium carbonate, which then go on this"
00:55:30,00:55:31,scaffold.
00:55:31,00:55:32,Right.
00:55:32,00:55:34,It sounds like we do know how it's made.
00:55:34,00:55:35,Yeah.
00:55:35,00:55:36,"Okay, but again."
00:55:36,00:55:37,"I mean, that's a broad brush."
00:55:37,00:55:38,We know what happens.
00:55:38,00:55:39,But how?
00:55:39,00:55:40,And also why?
00:55:40,00:55:41,"Yeah, exactly."
00:55:41,00:55:42,And then it can be.
00:55:42,00:55:46,But I just think that's insane that they can harvest.
00:55:46,00:55:48,But they don't know that they're doing it.
00:55:48,00:55:49,It's not on their chemist.
00:55:49,00:55:50,It doesn't make it less impressive.
00:55:50,00:55:55,"Well, it does make it a bit less impressive, but I do think it's just amazing."
00:55:55,00:55:56,It's really cool.
00:55:56,00:56:01,The world's most exclusive textile is made from a bivalve and I'd never heard of this.
00:56:01,00:56:02,Have you seen this?
00:56:02,00:56:04,It's made from the pen shell.
00:56:04,00:56:06,"So a bivalve is like a mussel, right?"
00:56:06,00:56:07,Or a snappy shell.
00:56:07,00:56:08,"Yeah, I think with two shells."
00:56:08,00:56:09,A snappy shell.
00:56:09,00:56:10,A pack man.
00:56:10,00:56:11,A pack man.
00:56:11,00:56:12,"Yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:56:12,00:56:17,There are only 60 items known to be made of this special silk from this special pen shell.
00:56:17,00:56:20,"And so you've seen one of these things and basically they're huge, aren't they?"
00:56:20,00:56:21,The shells?
00:56:21,00:56:22,They're like a metre tall.
00:56:22,00:56:23,"Yeah, I mean, they used to be."
00:56:23,00:56:24,Now they're not.
00:56:24,00:56:25,They're doing quite badly now and there's not as big.
00:56:25,00:56:26,"Yeah, they can."
00:56:26,00:56:27,It's basically like a beard.
00:56:27,00:56:32,"Oh, like when you have mussels, if you eat moulmagne and you pull off the mossy beardy"
00:56:32,00:56:33,"bits, the same stuff."
00:56:33,00:56:34,The threads.
00:56:34,00:56:35,"The threads, exactly."
00:56:35,00:56:38,"And then you use this hair to embed ourselves in the seed bed, right, that little root."
00:56:38,00:56:41,And then you make this amazing silk out of it.
00:56:41,00:56:42,"Yeah, you go through it."
00:56:42,00:56:43,It goes through stages of processing.
00:56:43,00:56:46,"I went to Sardinia, which is really where the only people left who do it."
00:56:46,00:56:47,What?
00:56:47,00:56:48,And I saw them going through.
00:56:48,00:56:49,"In fact, I think there's one woman left I read."
00:56:49,00:56:50,Did you meet one?
00:56:50,00:56:51,Yeah.
00:56:51,00:56:52,I met that one woman.
00:56:52,00:56:53,Oh.
00:56:53,00:56:54,Chiara Vigo.
00:56:54,00:56:57,I don't know if I should be mean.
00:56:57,00:57:02,"No, I'm not going to be mean, but she claims to be the last living mistress of sea silk,"
00:57:02,00:57:03,as it's called.
00:57:03,00:57:06,But I met several other people who do it.
00:57:06,00:57:09,And this is explosive news to me and probably no one else.
00:57:09,00:57:12,"No, and it's all in the book."
00:57:12,00:57:13,It's inspires and time.
00:57:13,00:57:14,I talk about it.
00:57:14,00:57:19,I met her and she's kind of all like very woo-woo about it and she can go into her little
00:57:19,00:57:22,"workshop and she does all this kind of, oh, and here it is, and I do all these things."
00:57:22,00:57:27,"But then, yeah, I met two other women who've learned it from there because it's handed."
00:57:27,00:57:30,"No one does it because you're not allowed to harvest these things anymore, but from"
00:57:30,00:57:34,"the fact they're not doing very well because they've just been wiped out by disease, pen"
00:57:34,00:57:37,"shells are now protected, so you can't go and take one to get there."
00:57:37,00:57:39,So did you call the police on this one?
00:57:39,00:57:43,"Well, no, because she claims that she can sustainably harvest them, but no one's allowed"
00:57:43,00:57:44,to watch her do it.
00:57:44,00:57:45,"That was the part where I was like, oh, okay."
00:57:45,00:57:48,"Yes, because she says she doesn't harm the shell, no she doesn't harm you."
00:57:48,00:57:52,"She's like, no, no, they're fine, they grow back and I'm like, they do grow back, but"
00:57:52,00:57:56,I don't know how fast and if it's fast enough and she doesn't let anyone watch her while
00:57:56,00:57:57,she's doing it.
