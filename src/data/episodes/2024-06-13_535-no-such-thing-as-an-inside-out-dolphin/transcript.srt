00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,920
 Hi everyone, welcome to this week's episode of No Such Thing as a Fish, where we were

2
00:00:05,920 --> 00:00:11,400
 joined by a special guest and that was Helen Scales.

3
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:17,120
 Now if you don't know Helen, she is a marine biologist, a writer, a broadcaster.

4
00:00:17,120 --> 00:00:18,900
 We've known her for many, many years.

5
00:00:18,900 --> 00:00:22,840
 She's so funny, so interesting, she loves her subject so much.

6
00:00:22,840 --> 00:00:25,040
 Her books are absolutely great.

7
00:00:25,040 --> 00:00:27,880
 The first one that she wrote was called Spirals in Time.

8
00:00:27,880 --> 00:00:32,500
 I think that was the first one, which was all about shells and the history of shells.

9
00:00:32,500 --> 00:00:37,520
 And her most recent one is called What the Wild Sea Can Be.

10
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:42,780
 And it is basically a look at the future of the oceans, which you might think is quite

11
00:00:42,780 --> 00:00:45,680
 negative because of all the news stories that are going around.

12
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:50,640
 But Helen, as is her want, is very positive about what the future might be and how we

13
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:52,640
 can save the world.

14
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:57,200
 If you'd like to get her books, obviously they're available from all the usual places.

15
00:00:57,200 --> 00:01:02,800
 But if you go to helenscales.com, you can visit her shop, which is related to the online

16
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:04,360
 bookseller's bookshop.

17
00:01:04,360 --> 00:01:09,560
 And if you go there, then all her commissions will go to the charity Sea Changers.

18
00:01:09,560 --> 00:01:13,400
 So you'll help save the sea as well as learning about the sea.

19
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:17,000
 There's also details on her website about a couple of shows she's doing to promote the

20
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:20,680
 book, so make sure you have a look at that if you like what you hear in this episode.

21
00:01:20,680 --> 00:01:22,640
 And I know that you will.

22
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:25,440
 One more thing to say, you know we have a tour coming up.

23
00:01:25,440 --> 00:01:31,920
 There are still tickets for most of the UK dates and a couple of the Australia dates

24
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:32,920
 left for that.

25
00:01:32,920 --> 00:01:40,120
 So do get your tickets ASAP and the people of Sydney and London do go back to know such

26
00:01:40,120 --> 00:01:45,960
 things as fish.com/live because there are details of new dates on there.

27
00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:50,000
 So if you missed out on tickets to Sydney or London, then fear not because we have put

28
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,360
 some more dates on.

29
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:52,520
 Okay, that's it.

30
00:01:52,520 --> 00:01:53,920
 That's all I have to say this week.

31
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:58,120
 So really all there is left to say is on with the podcast.

32
00:01:58,120 --> 00:01:59,120
 So let's say it.

33
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:18,080
 On with the podcast.

34
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:23,480
 Hello and welcome to another episode of No Such Thing as a Fish, a weekly podcast coming

35
00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:26,140
 to you from the QI offices in Hoburn.

36
00:02:26,140 --> 00:02:30,520
 My name is Anna Tyshinski and I'm sitting here with Andrew Hunter Murray, James Harkin

37
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:34,720
 and extra special guest today, Helen Scales.

38
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:38,240
 And we have gathered round on microphones with our four favourite facts from the last

39
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:39,400
 seven days.

40
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:45,080
 So in no particular order here we go.

41
00:02:45,080 --> 00:02:47,080
 Starting with Helen.

42
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:50,200
 My fact is you can play peek-a-boo with an octopus.

43
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:51,200
 Wow.

44
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:54,080
 That sounds like fun.

45
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:56,280
 I think it was peek-a-boo.

46
00:02:56,280 --> 00:02:57,280
 That's what I was doing.

47
00:02:57,280 --> 00:02:58,280
 Because you've done this.

48
00:02:58,280 --> 00:02:59,280
 Yeah.

49
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:00,280
 Yeah.

50
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:01,280
 That's a personal fact.

51
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:02,280
 Exactly.

52
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:03,280
 How did peek-a-boo work?

53
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:04,280
 Because the game is quite rules-wise.

54
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:05,280
 I think so.

55
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:06,280
 Yeah.

56
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:07,280
 Maybe it was hide and seek.

57
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:08,400
 No, I think it was peek-a-boo.

58
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:14,240
 So basically I was coming back from a freedive or a snorkel if I want to make it sound not

59
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:16,960
 as cool, but I'll say freedive because that does sound cooler.

60
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:20,920
 And I was literally just a couple of feet from the beach and the water was like knee-high

61
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:24,200
 and I looked down, I was floating and I looked down and there was an octopus behind a rock

62
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:29,080
 and I was like, awesome because I love octopuses and I see them occasionally, but it's definitely

63
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:30,520
 a special thing to see.

64
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:31,520
 Where were you in the world?

65
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:32,520
 Oh, sorry.

66
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:33,920
 I was in Brittany in France.

67
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:34,920
 Very nice.

68
00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:35,920
 Yeah.

69
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:38,920
 So there was this octopus and I was like, awesome, okay, fantastic.

70
00:03:38,920 --> 00:03:45,080
 And then generally when I see exciting animals like that you have to be like just looking

71
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:48,880
 as much as possible because any second now it's going to just fuck off, right?

72
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:51,520
 And you're left with like, oh, that was a lovely encounter, but it lasted like seconds.

73
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:56,160
 But this one didn't move and I was just hanging out with it and how big are we talking?

74
00:03:56,160 --> 00:04:01,840
 I mean, in my mind it was like maybe a small melon sized, I think, kind of thing.

75
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:02,840
 Okay.

76
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:06,040
 So first off, I did the My Octopus Teacher Touching thing.

77
00:04:06,040 --> 00:04:07,040
 Have you seen My Octopus?

78
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:08,040
 No.

79
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:09,040
 No, not really.

80
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:13,120
 There's a bit basically where if you put your hand out, an octopus will reach out and touch

81
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:14,120
 you with its arms.

82
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:16,080
 Oh, so it's like God and Adam in the Michelangelo.

83
00:04:16,080 --> 00:04:17,080
 Exactly, exactly.

84
00:04:17,080 --> 00:04:18,080
 But God is an octopus.

85
00:04:18,080 --> 00:04:19,080
 And they do do that.

86
00:04:19,080 --> 00:04:22,000
 They basically, they're tasting you to see what you are because their suckers are really

87
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,720
 sensitive and they can have you like taste the chemicals and stuff.

88
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:27,800
 So I put my hand out and it did, it's like put its little arm out and it's tiny and thin

89
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:32,080
 at the end and it was like, yeah, but it touched me and I was like, oh, that was amazing.

90
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:36,080
 And then so we did that and I was like, okay, so what else can I do with this octopus, you

91
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:37,080
 know, while it's got my-

92
00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:38,080
 Let's pick it up a notch.

93
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:42,480
 So I was like, well, what if I just hide it from it?

94
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:44,820
 Maybe you'll try and come and find me.

95
00:04:44,820 --> 00:04:45,820
 Wow.

96
00:04:45,820 --> 00:04:47,560
 And so I moved out of its line of sight.

97
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:49,040
 So that it couldn't see me.

98
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:51,040
 And it was just, it just like peered around the rock.

99
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:53,040
 You know, it was definitely like, where have you gone?

100
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:54,040
 You're over there.

101
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:56,760
 And I'm like, no, you go.

102
00:04:56,760 --> 00:05:01,680
 But I just really had this sense of something a bit more intelligent and it's thinking about

103
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:03,240
 you and it's interacting with you.

104
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:05,480
 And it was just really, a really cool moment.

105
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:08,160
 So it didn't then hide from you or anything like that?

106
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:09,520
 No, it didn't hide from me.

107
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:12,680
 Then I think at that point I was like, I'm getting really cold and I need to get out.

108
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:15,520
 Can you do something a bit more interesting than just sit there?

109
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:17,400
 And so I think I was like, I'm going to get a bit closer.

110
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:21,360
 And at that point it was like, and it went off and changed it.

111
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:25,280
 You know, you hear about how octopuses change color and texture and stuff, and it really

112
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:26,280
 did.

113
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:27,760
 It had been like pale and smooth.

114
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:30,960
 And then instantly it turned like really angry red and very bumpy.

115
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:31,960
 And I was like, oh, wow.

116
00:05:31,960 --> 00:05:32,960
 Sorry.

117
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:33,960
 Are the bumps real?

118
00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:34,960
 Yeah.

119
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:35,960
 Yeah.

120
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:36,960
 So there's skin.

121
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:37,960
 It's not just that it looks.

122
00:05:37,960 --> 00:05:38,960
 Yeah.

123
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:39,960
 Yeah.

124
00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:40,960
 So there's skin is like loads of little muscles and they can pull up and make little like warts

125
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:43,840
 and little bumps and then they can flat themselves out and change the color is also

126
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:44,840
 the muscles too.

127
00:05:44,840 --> 00:05:48,200
 They have these like bubbles of pigment which can open and close and they can change their

128
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:49,200
 color.

129
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:50,200
 It's like pixels basically.

130
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:51,200
 I knew that's how they show their color.

131
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:55,200
 I just sort of assume that they, I didn't assume anything, I just thought I did it.

132
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:56,200
 They didn't really think about it, did they?

133
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:57,200
 No.

134
00:05:57,200 --> 00:05:58,200
 No.

135
00:05:58,200 --> 00:05:59,200
 Because he wouldn't really.

136
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:00,200
 They're just like the way that you blush maybe.

137
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:01,200
 They might just change color.

138
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:02,200
 Yeah.

139
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:03,200
 They have layers in their skin.

140
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:04,200
 We can't blush lots of colors.

141
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:05,200
 No.

142
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:06,200
 I find that we could blush loads of different colors.

143
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:07,200
 Like I could blush blue if I was.

144
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:08,200
 Exactly.

145
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:09,200
 On command.

146
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:10,200
 That would be like a really cool thing to do with like GM.

147
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:11,200
 Right.

148
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:12,200
 Just to like give ourselves chromatophores.

149
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:13,200
 Yeah.

150
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:14,200
 That would be good.

151
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:19,800
 It'd be like it'd be easier for those, you know those parties where you have to go in

152
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:21,920
 a color like if you're available you wear green.

153
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:23,720
 Oh, you'll swing those parties.

154
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:24,720
 Yeah.

155
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:31,120
 It's not always easy to find an Amber shirt.

156
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:33,920
 They definitely do seem to be animals where you can have a bit of a relationship.

157
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:34,920
 I think so.

158
00:06:34,920 --> 00:06:35,920
 Yeah.

159
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:38,040
 I mean, I'm not going to say I made friends with it, but I just felt like for a moment

160
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:40,440
 we had a bit of a play and that was cool.

161
00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:42,840
 I mean, I haven't ever played with a crab, for instance.

162
00:06:42,840 --> 00:06:45,720
 That's never really worked out or a big try then.

163
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:46,720
 Yeah.

164
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:47,720
 The crabs just don't go for the peekaboo.

165
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:48,720
 They really don't.

166
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:51,040
 Well, sometimes the octopuses don't want to be friends.

167
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:54,040
 Like they seem to have such personalities that they're discerning about who they like.

168
00:06:54,040 --> 00:06:58,680
 There was a person who worked in a New England aquarium who, one of the octopuses there just

169
00:06:58,680 --> 00:07:02,760
 completely took against him and used to squirt him in the room whenever he walked in, just

170
00:07:02,760 --> 00:07:04,080
 actually hated him.

171
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:07,640
 And then I think he left and did a degree or something, left the university and he came

172
00:07:07,640 --> 00:07:11,360
 back and immediately the octopus was like, "Not Barry again."

173
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:12,600
 And went with him again.

174
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:13,600
 Yeah.

175
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:14,760
 They are a bit moody like that.

176
00:07:14,760 --> 00:07:15,760
 Yeah.

177
00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:19,240
 I've heard stories about octopuses being given food they don't like and just being like this

178
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:23,040
 and they hold up to the person and go like, "Uh-uh, see what I'm going to do with this?"

179
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:26,440
 And they swim across to the other side of the tank and stuff it in the drain and be like,

180
00:07:26,440 --> 00:07:27,440
 "No."

181
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:28,440
 Wow.

182
00:07:28,440 --> 00:07:29,440
 That's where that's going.

183
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:30,440
 Like a toddler, basically.

184
00:07:30,440 --> 00:07:31,440
 Yeah.

185
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:32,440
 I imagine there are all those sorts of studies of like intelligence that are about that kind

186
00:07:32,440 --> 00:07:33,440
 of level of...

187
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:35,440
 I reckon although toddlers can't play hide and seek.

188
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:36,440
 Can they not?

189
00:07:36,440 --> 00:07:37,440
 No, no, no.

190
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:39,200
 They just think you're not there when you close your eyes.

191
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:40,200
 Yeah, yeah.

192
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:44,560
 They did a study where they gave a toddler a doll and they put a blindfold on the doll

193
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:46,960
 and the toddler thought that they couldn't see it.

194
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:49,400
 Wait, they thought that the doll couldn't see the toddler?

195
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:50,400
 Yeah.

196
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:51,400
 But the doll couldn't see the toddler either way?

197
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:52,400
 No, no, no.

198
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:55,000
 They thought that the toddler thought the doll had gone invisible.

199
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:58,800
 The doll had gone invisible because they don't think that because I feel like I've heard that

200
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:01,680
 kind of thing and obviously the study was done, but I've heard that kind of thing where like

201
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:05,400
 they think if you club your eyes and you've gone, but when you do it with kids they don't

202
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:06,400
 think you've just...

203
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:07,400
 I literally did it yesterday and it worked.

204
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:08,400
 With you?

205
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:09,400
 Yeah, yeah.

206
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:10,560
 So they just think that they can see your body?

207
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:13,200
 I said to her, I said, "Look at me, that took a while."

208
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:17,400
 She doesn't really do what I tell her, but then eventually she looked at me and I covered

209
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:18,880
 my eyes and I said, "Can you see me?"

210
00:08:18,880 --> 00:08:19,880
 And she said, "No."

211
00:08:19,880 --> 00:08:23,080
 Does that mean that she thinks she can't see you though or that she thinks the thing

212
00:08:23,080 --> 00:08:24,600
 to say in this game is no?

213
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:25,600
 Well, because...

214
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:29,600
 It feels like if you vanished then children would be like, "What the hell just happened?"

215
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:33,880
 But the other evidence is that if you play hide and seek with a child, if they cover their

216
00:08:33,880 --> 00:08:35,520
 eyes they think you can't see them.

217
00:08:35,520 --> 00:08:39,080
 That's why just in the middle of the room, eyes closed, I'm hiding.

218
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:40,080
 That's great.

219
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:41,080
 Yeah.

220
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:43,640
 And the really interesting thing is it works for voices as well apparently, although I

221
00:08:43,640 --> 00:08:47,160
 tried this with my daughter and it didn't work, but apparently there was a study where

222
00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:51,160
 experimenters put their hands over their ears and said to the child, "Can you hear me?"

223
00:08:51,160 --> 00:08:52,880
 And the child said, "No, I can't hear you."

224
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:57,880
 Now I did try this and it didn't work with my daughter, but I'm not sure if that means

225
00:08:57,880 --> 00:08:59,880
 she's too smart or not smart enough.

226
00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:04,160
 If you put on a different voice, will she think that, for example, Bruce Forsythe is

227
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:05,160
 in the room.

228
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:08,480
 And she's like, "Nice to see you."

229
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:12,520
 "I can't see you."

230
00:09:12,520 --> 00:09:16,720
 Octopus is, I think, have they been re-classed in Britain in terms of their intelligence?

231
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:19,840
 Because they're so, literally they're so clever that the government has now classed them along

232
00:09:19,840 --> 00:09:21,340
 with vertebrates.

233
00:09:21,340 --> 00:09:26,960
 But they're way cleverer than most, not most, lots of vertebrates and they are classed as

234
00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:27,960
 sentient beings.

235
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:28,960
 That's right.

236
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:29,960
 Yeah.

237
00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:30,960
 That's good news.

238
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:31,960
 It is good news.

239
00:09:31,960 --> 00:09:34,040
 It means, well, hopefully it means now we have to be nicer to them.

240
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:36,920
 Because there are all sorts of discussions about, "Oh, should we farm them?"

241
00:09:36,920 --> 00:09:40,720
 And it's like, "Should we farm these really intelligent, amazing, weird creatures?"

242
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:44,560
 That don't like living together and they're generally cannibalistic and, you know, all

243
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:45,560
 sorts of stuff like that.

244
00:09:45,560 --> 00:09:48,800
 You don't want to farm like where all the cows are eating each other.

245
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:49,800
 Well, exactly.

246
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:53,600
 You don't want there's one great big octopus left at the end and something that's no longer

247
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:55,600
 going to be possible.

248
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:57,120
 Chop it up and just just eat.

249
00:09:57,120 --> 00:10:01,040
 You might get the same number of steaks from one enormous cow that's eaten all the other

250
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:02,040
 cows.

251
00:10:02,040 --> 00:10:03,040
 And it's easier to herd, isn't it?

252
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:04,040
 If you just got one.

253
00:10:04,040 --> 00:10:05,040
 You're a big dog.

254
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:06,040
 Yeah.

255
00:10:06,040 --> 00:10:07,040
 Very big dog.

256
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:08,040
 It's tragic.

257
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:09,760
 They can't write, but they do pretty zinc.

258
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:11,260
 Oh, that is tragic.

259
00:10:11,260 --> 00:10:15,340
 Is that in the Alanis Morissette song?

260
00:10:15,340 --> 00:10:17,440
 Is it wasps or bees that can make paper?

261
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:18,440
 Yeah, wasps.

262
00:10:18,440 --> 00:10:19,940
 Wasps can make paper.

263
00:10:19,940 --> 00:10:20,940
 If they could get together.

264
00:10:20,940 --> 00:10:21,940
 Never the twain.

265
00:10:21,940 --> 00:10:22,940
 Oh, that's tragic.

266
00:10:22,940 --> 00:10:27,360
 If you give a wasp a snorkel and imagine that you have it for two species could wreak.

267
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:28,360
 What was it?

268
00:10:28,360 --> 00:10:29,360
 Alanis Morissette, ironic.

269
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:30,360
 Yeah.

270
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:31,360
 But they weren't very ironic.

271
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:32,360
 No.

272
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:33,360
 They weren't very ironic.

273
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:34,360
 They weren't very ironic.

274
00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:35,360
 There was someone else.

275
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:36,360
 All right.

276
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:37,360
 Avril Lavigne.

277
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:38,360
 No, it was.

278
00:10:38,360 --> 00:10:39,360
 It was.

279
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:40,360
 You're thinking of skater by.

280
00:10:40,360 --> 00:10:41,360
 Yeah.

281
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:42,360
 I could use the two the other day in the social situation.

282
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:43,360
 And I haven't had the end of it yet.

283
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:44,360
 Anyway.

284
00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:45,360
 He was a wasp.

285
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:46,360
 She was an octopus.

286
00:10:46,360 --> 00:10:51,360
 Can I make it any more obvious?

287
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:53,360
 They're very strong octopuses as well.

288
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:56,080
 Every sucker is so powerful, isn't it?

289
00:10:56,080 --> 00:10:58,040
 And I think I worked out.

290
00:10:58,040 --> 00:11:02,320
 So if a sucker touches an object, it changes shape to form this seal around it.

291
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:07,160
 And I realized that the common octopus, if it's hanging off the ceiling, the four of

292
00:11:07,160 --> 00:11:11,920
 us, and I've done some vague weight estimates, and I think it wouldn't be true if Dan was

293
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:12,920
 here.

294
00:11:12,920 --> 00:11:21,440
 But I think the four of us, that is no heavier than I am, for sure.

295
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:25,000
 But James, who does Dan have to be heavier than for this to work with the four of us,

296
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,000
 but not if Dan was here?

297
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,000
 No, I do see that.

298
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,000
 I do see it.

299
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,200
 But it did sound like a slam on Dan's head.

300
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:34,800
 Look, I think we can safely say that Helen is a few inches shorter than Dan's, but they're

301
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:35,800
 both in great shape.

302
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:37,760
 But Dan probably weighs a few pounds more.

303
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:41,520
 Once I was in the ITV studios on the South Bank, and there was a load of people in the

304
00:11:41,520 --> 00:11:46,440
 lift, and I walked into the lift, and it went beep, beep, beep, please leave the lift, because

305
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:51,160
 I was the person who put it over the level, and I felt awful, like it was a really low

306
00:11:51,160 --> 00:11:52,520
 moment in my life.

307
00:11:52,520 --> 00:11:57,280
 But imagine that if all your mates are hanging off an octopus, and you're the one that pulls

308
00:11:57,280 --> 00:11:58,280
 him down.

309
00:11:58,280 --> 00:11:59,280
 No, that's it.

310
00:11:59,280 --> 00:12:00,280
 I'm letting go.

311
00:12:00,280 --> 00:12:04,680
 Do you know what happens if you cut the arm off an octopus?

312
00:12:04,680 --> 00:12:06,800
 So this is, you know, if you want to eat it.

313
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:07,800
 Does it live?

314
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:08,800
 Yeah.

315
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:11,600
 So fishermen will chop the arms off and stick them in the bucket, and they try to climb

316
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:12,600
 out, basically.

317
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:17,880
 So octopus have like 500 million neurons, but half of them are in their arms.

318
00:12:17,880 --> 00:12:22,560
 So they have a very different kind of nerve system to us, but it's not all in their brain.

319
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:25,120
 So the question is, like, do they think for themselves these arms?

320
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:27,280
 So they're like actually able to make their own decisions.

321
00:12:27,280 --> 00:12:31,280
 But what we think they're doing is that their kind of response is to pass food towards the

322
00:12:31,280 --> 00:12:32,280
 mouth.

323
00:12:32,280 --> 00:12:34,880
 So if a bit of food goes to the end of the arm, the suckers are like passing it to the

324
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:36,320
 next one and to the next one.

325
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:40,800
 And actually that same motion, if you've chopped an arm off in a bucket, is climb out of the

326
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:41,800
 bucket.

327
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:42,800
 Do you see what I mean?

328
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:43,800
 So they're just trying to pass.

329
00:12:43,800 --> 00:12:45,880
 They're just like, this is the thing we do.

330
00:12:45,880 --> 00:12:52,080
 So it's not, there's not necessarily any thought in it, but they will basically walk off.

331
00:12:52,080 --> 00:12:55,280
 The other thing, if you cut the very tip of an arm, it will still respond to like nasty

332
00:12:55,280 --> 00:12:56,280
 chemicals.

333
00:12:56,280 --> 00:12:59,640
 So people who are like doing science and they'll take just a little bit of tissue off and then

334
00:12:59,640 --> 00:13:03,520
 you try and put the little tip of the arm into a pot of alcohol and it goes, oh no, ow.

335
00:13:03,520 --> 00:13:06,000
 Oh, are we calling alcohol a nasty chemical?

336
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,000
 Oh, sorry.

337
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:13,200
 Well, I guess very high concentrations of alcohol used to preserve the tip of an octopus's arm.

338
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:14,200
 100% scientific stuff.

339
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:17,680
 Unfortunately for you, Helen, that's what Anna likes to do.

340
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:18,760
 My limbs have cut off.

341
00:13:18,760 --> 00:13:19,760
 Go towards.

342
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:25,720
 Just a thumbs up for Anna's removed and.

343
00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:27,200
 You don't eat octopuses, right?

344
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:28,200
 No, I don't.

345
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:29,200
 No.

346
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:30,200
 Do you eat other fish?

347
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:31,200
 Sometimes.

348
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:32,200
 And not much anymore.

349
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:33,360
 I did for a long time.

350
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:36,880
 I gave up eating meat years and years ago and I kind of kept on eating sustainably caught

351
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:38,040
 fish.

352
00:13:38,040 --> 00:13:40,040
 But definitely octopuses you wouldn't eat octopuses.

353
00:13:40,040 --> 00:13:41,040
 No, not since meeting one.

354
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:42,920
 I definitely not since playing peek-a-boo with one.

355
00:13:42,920 --> 00:13:43,920
 I couldn't.

356
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:48,120
 Something else that needs to avoid eating octopuses is the dolphin.

357
00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:51,640
 Although, I mean, they do like to sometimes and octopuses are really good food for other

358
00:13:51,640 --> 00:13:55,760
 sea animals because I guess they're very meaty, but they're quite dangerous to swallow.

359
00:13:55,760 --> 00:14:01,000
 And I think when dolphins do eat octopuses, they have to really work hard on cutting up

360
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,480
 their food to tear them to shreds because they did.

361
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:07,920
 I think they found a dead dolphin recently in the last couple of years, which had an

362
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:12,000
 octopus in its mouth and you can see its tentacles like flopping out of its mouth.

363
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:16,040
 So if I'm a dolphin and I have an octopus and it sort of clings onto the inside of

364
00:14:16,040 --> 00:14:20,000
 my throat as it's going down, because I haven't chewed it properly, does it pull me inside

365
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,520
 out is what I'm trying to say?

366
00:14:21,520 --> 00:14:22,520
 Why?

367
00:14:22,520 --> 00:14:25,000
 I'll end up coming in to work the next day saying, "Oh, I think I had a doggie octopus

368
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:29,040
 last night because it's attached to the inside of the tube that is me."

369
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:30,040
 Yes.

370
00:14:30,040 --> 00:14:31,040
 Yeah, how's it done that?

371
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:32,040
 And it's gone all the way through.

372
00:14:32,040 --> 00:14:35,200
 I don't think the dolphin was inside out when they found it and afraid that would be even

373
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:40,240
 more grotesque than the already the truth, which is like you say it suckers onto their

374
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:43,440
 esophagus until it chokes them to death, which is quite clever.

375
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:44,440
 Yeah.

376
00:14:44,440 --> 00:14:45,440
 Because they'd be trained.

377
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:47,360
 The CIA are always training dolphins and things, aren't they?

378
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:48,360
 Good point.

379
00:14:48,360 --> 00:14:49,360
 Yeah.

380
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:52,080
 Are you thinking, Andy, that we can defeat the CIA for whatever reason we might want

381
00:14:52,080 --> 00:14:56,680
 to by sending an army of octopuses to turn the dolphins inside out?

382
00:14:56,680 --> 00:14:57,680
 Oh, yeah.

383
00:14:57,680 --> 00:15:01,200
 I'll send a strong message, won't I?

384
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:03,480
 Britain is back on the global stage.

385
00:15:03,480 --> 00:15:07,480
 We've inverted every dolphin the CIA has ever trained.

386
00:15:07,480 --> 00:15:15,320
 Okay, it's time for fact number two and that is my fact.

387
00:15:15,320 --> 00:15:20,760
 My fact this week is that during winter, the ground is too cold for male emperor penguins

388
00:15:20,760 --> 00:15:21,760
 feet.

389
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:25,720
 So they spend two months leaning back and balancing on their heels.

390
00:15:25,720 --> 00:15:27,480
 That's great.

391
00:15:27,480 --> 00:15:30,200
 It's just so painful and uncomfortable.

392
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:34,720
 They sound like kind of relaxed dads, you know, they're leaning back on their tail.

393
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:39,680
 Like they lean back on the little sort of like a hunting stick, I guess.

394
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:42,400
 Is that what it, you know, those shooting sticks?

395
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:43,400
 Shooting sticks.

396
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:44,400
 Yeah.

397
00:15:44,400 --> 00:15:45,840
 Oh, the lady sits on the beach.

398
00:15:45,840 --> 00:15:46,840
 Yeah.

399
00:15:46,840 --> 00:15:48,720
 So, yeah, I'm guessing you're very familiar with this and we should just say why they

400
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:49,920
 have to do this.

401
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:50,920
 Because it's cold.

402
00:15:50,920 --> 00:15:51,920
 Because it's cold.

403
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:52,920
 Really cold.

404
00:15:52,920 --> 00:15:55,040
 Because it's really, really cold.

405
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:56,040
 It's freezing.

406
00:15:56,040 --> 00:15:57,040
 They're in Antarctica.

407
00:15:57,040 --> 00:16:01,560
 It's minus 40 Celsius and the female essentially lays her egg.

408
00:16:01,560 --> 00:16:05,800
 I think this is right and it's in the middle of winter because they need to start incubating

409
00:16:05,800 --> 00:16:09,120
 the egg so that it's born in nice springtime when there's lots of food.

410
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:13,560
 So middle of winter, cold as possible time, the females laid the egg, plopped it in front

411
00:16:13,560 --> 00:16:19,120
 of the male, disappeared for a couple of months and they have this incredible pouch that they

412
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:23,040
 plop over the egg and the egg balances on his feet.

413
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:26,680
 But then if his feet are flat on the ground, then they just get super, super cold.

414
00:16:26,680 --> 00:16:31,800
 And so, as you say, he leans back and like a tripod balances on his tail for two months.

415
00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:33,480
 I'd vaguely seen that they did this.

416
00:16:33,480 --> 00:16:36,440
 I had no idea about the details and how difficult it is.

417
00:16:36,440 --> 00:16:38,720
 The dads can only eat snow for those months.

418
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:40,760
 They get pretty skinny, don't they, by the end?

419
00:16:40,760 --> 00:16:44,520
 They lose half their weight sometimes, or 40% and the dads basically had an enormous mega

420
00:16:44,520 --> 00:16:45,960
 barbecue the summer before.

421
00:16:45,960 --> 00:16:48,840
 All the dads hang out, they put on lots and lots of weight because they know they're going

422
00:16:48,840 --> 00:16:49,840
 to need it.

423
00:16:49,840 --> 00:16:50,840
 They use it all up.

424
00:16:50,840 --> 00:16:51,840
 Oh, that's interesting.

425
00:16:51,840 --> 00:16:55,480
 So when am I going to lose this weight that I thought I'm going to have to be in a dad's

426
00:16:55,480 --> 00:16:56,480
 sect?

427
00:16:56,480 --> 00:17:00,620
 You need to head on down south and spend quite a bit of time on the sea ice.

428
00:17:00,620 --> 00:17:02,320
 They just lose no heat.

429
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:05,760
 Scientists did the sort of, you know, those heat map body things that you do, you know,

430
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:07,600
 you see where someone's losing heat.

431
00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:12,440
 And I think they found that the only places they're losing heat are through their eyes.

432
00:17:12,440 --> 00:17:20,600
 You know, in Dune, the film Dune and the book Dune, they've got those still suits, which

433
00:17:20,600 --> 00:17:22,360
 allow them to lose zero moisture.

434
00:17:22,360 --> 00:17:24,360
 Yeah, they're really good.

435
00:17:24,360 --> 00:17:25,360
 They're basically in the desert.

436
00:17:25,360 --> 00:17:26,360
 We're on the planet Arrakis.

437
00:17:26,360 --> 00:17:27,360
 We get the idea.

438
00:17:27,360 --> 00:17:28,360
 Yeah, yeah.

439
00:17:28,360 --> 00:17:31,080
 But they've got these suits, which means they lose no moisture.

440
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:34,000
 Emperor penguins are basically that bodily.

441
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,500
 They just can't do it and not lose heat.

442
00:17:35,500 --> 00:17:38,600
 Yeah, they get so hot, like, you know, they do that huddling thing, the males, when there's

443
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:42,160
 a blizzard and they all cuddle together, they can be like so hot, they have to break apart

444
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:44,720
 and be like, oh, God, I need some steaming.

445
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:45,720
 Yeah.

446
00:17:45,720 --> 00:17:49,000
 It sounds like more, it sounds more of a thing, which you wouldn't think because you see them

447
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:52,720
 in documentaries and you feel so sorry for how cold they must be, but actually it seems

448
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:54,360
 like overheating is more of a problem.

449
00:17:54,360 --> 00:17:55,360
 Actually, potentially more of a problem.

450
00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:56,360
 Yeah.

451
00:17:56,360 --> 00:17:59,120
 And I always thought that those big huddles where, you know, hundreds of them, as you

452
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:01,960
 say, plump together, don't they, and they rotate, who's on the inside.

453
00:18:01,960 --> 00:18:04,080
 I always thought they lasted for ages.

454
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:08,240
 That was kind of how they stood, but apparently it's about 50 minutes each one last.

455
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:12,480
 And it's really like, yeah, when it blows through and it's really cold.

456
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:14,480
 Do you think they don't feel cold then?

457
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:17,760
 I think they would if they got cold.

458
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:19,360
 It just sounds like that they don't.

459
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:23,760
 Their threshold is just way lower than humans, so it's, I think it's down to minus 10 Celsius.

460
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:24,760
 They're basically comfortable.

461
00:18:24,760 --> 00:18:30,000
 Well, actually that's the same as someone from Newcastle, I think.

462
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,200
 That's why the black and white is the essence.

463
00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:34,320
 They're still a bit chilly then, I guess.

464
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:37,880
 If minus 10, they're comfortable, minus 40, they're probably like, that's when they're

465
00:18:37,880 --> 00:18:39,680
 like, oh, let's all, you know, let's get through it.

466
00:18:39,680 --> 00:18:43,000
 Do they have human conceptions of discomfort in the way that we do, you know, I don't know.

467
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:46,120
 Well, that comes back to the whole sentient thing, you know, that's kind of the big thing

468
00:18:46,120 --> 00:18:47,120
 of that.

469
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:48,120
 It's like, are they suffering?

470
00:18:48,120 --> 00:18:51,000
 Is the first penguin dad to suggest a huddle looked on as a bit of a wuss?

471
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,000
 Yeah.

472
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:55,720
 Is everyone secretly hoping someone's going to do it, but no one wants to be the first

473
00:18:55,720 --> 00:18:56,720
 one?

474
00:18:56,720 --> 00:18:59,080
 Oh, I'm not going to hug you.

475
00:18:59,080 --> 00:19:01,600
 I'm just trying to eat.

476
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:04,600
 One thing I like about the whole penguin feather thing is, if you've seen the video, if you've

477
00:19:04,600 --> 00:19:09,600
 seen kind of on Blue Planet or whatever it was, the emperor penguins whooshing up underwater

478
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:13,120
 and jumping out, like they do this kind of leaps, right?

479
00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:16,200
 They basically, that's like, need to get out of the water because there's probably something

480
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:20,880
 coming to eat me, but my little legs aren't going to be very good at clambering off onto

481
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:21,880
 the ice.

482
00:19:21,880 --> 00:19:24,040
 So they swim up from deep down and it's skin that's their feathers.

483
00:19:24,040 --> 00:19:27,240
 So basically as they go down, they hold their contour feathers, the outside ones in place,

484
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:29,640
 they lock them in place so that the air is trapped.

485
00:19:29,640 --> 00:19:33,320
 And then as they're coming up, they basically let that air out and it all comes fizzing out

486
00:19:33,320 --> 00:19:39,760
 of the little under fuzzy bits and forms a stream of bubbles and it's called air lubrication

487
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:42,200
 and basically reduces the friction against the water.

488
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:47,160
 And so they go a bit faster and they go popping out the water at the top and then they land

489
00:19:47,160 --> 00:19:50,760
 on the ice and they've got even, they've got a nice little tummy, the fronts are covered

490
00:19:50,760 --> 00:19:51,760
 with more feathers.

491
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:53,360
 So when they land, it's nice cushion.

492
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:54,360
 That is so cool.

493
00:19:54,360 --> 00:19:55,360
 That's not really good.

494
00:19:55,360 --> 00:20:00,480
 They've got tricks for days, they're really, they're a real risk of climate change, aren't

495
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:01,480
 they?

496
00:20:01,480 --> 00:20:02,480
 Yeah, sadly, yes.

497
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:06,380
 They live on sea ice and if sea ice melts, that's the, this bit, specifically this bit

498
00:20:06,380 --> 00:20:10,680
 with the males and the, and the chick rearing is on the sea ice and it's all on the outside,

499
00:20:10,680 --> 00:20:11,680
 isn't it?

500
00:20:11,680 --> 00:20:12,680
 Yeah, exactly.

501
00:20:12,680 --> 00:20:13,680
 Because they need access to the sea.

502
00:20:13,680 --> 00:20:17,780
 If the ice melts basically, then that means they, like lots of colonies have had complete

503
00:20:17,780 --> 00:20:21,600
 breeding failures where no chick survived to the next year and it's happened two years

504
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:22,600
 in a row now.

505
00:20:22,600 --> 00:20:23,600
 It's really, it's really bad.

506
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:24,600
 Yeah.

507
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:28,120
 And I think the idea is that if the world keeps to 1.5 degrees of warming, then the numbers

508
00:20:28,120 --> 00:20:32,160
 will hold up much, much better than if it goes far beyond that, you know.

509
00:20:32,160 --> 00:20:34,440
 So that, yeah, no, it definitely matters.

510
00:20:34,440 --> 00:20:37,680
 Like every degree, every degree we can like avoid of heating, like the better the emperor

511
00:20:37,680 --> 00:20:38,680
 penguins will do.

512
00:20:38,680 --> 00:20:42,840
 And you know, like the cool thing I love about it as well is how we study numbers of penguins

513
00:20:42,840 --> 00:20:43,840
 is from satellites.

514
00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:47,600
 There's like once a week a satellite passes over Antarctica and takes photos and you

515
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:51,780
 can only do that during the summer because it's dark during the winter, obviously, and

516
00:20:51,780 --> 00:20:53,900
 you can't see anything.

517
00:20:53,900 --> 00:20:56,980
 But in the summer months, they pass over and take photos and then you can count the penguins

518
00:20:56,980 --> 00:20:58,220
 and they're poo basically.

519
00:20:58,220 --> 00:21:00,500
 The guano stains the ice and you can see where they are.

520
00:21:00,500 --> 00:21:02,780
 So that's how you figure out how many there are.

521
00:21:02,780 --> 00:21:07,820
 And so basically the end of the winter, when the sun comes up again, it's like fingers crossed

522
00:21:07,820 --> 00:21:08,820
 everybody.

523
00:21:08,820 --> 00:21:10,020
 I like how many are still there?

524
00:21:10,020 --> 00:21:11,020
 Like how many of these...

525
00:21:11,020 --> 00:21:13,020
 You're looking for a huge poo on the ice.

526
00:21:13,020 --> 00:21:14,020
 Basically, yeah.

527
00:21:14,020 --> 00:21:15,020
 And then that's when we see.

528
00:21:15,020 --> 00:21:18,520
 This year, we won't know till because it's just going dark now.

529
00:21:18,520 --> 00:21:24,480
 We won't know till like September, October how this year's clutch of penguins has done.

530
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:29,400
 I wonder if they take into account the level of poo by which I mean, like, let's say your

531
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:33,480
 penguins are not eating very well for whatever reason.

532
00:21:33,480 --> 00:21:34,480
 They might poo less.

533
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:37,060
 And I wonder if when they look at it, they can be honest.

534
00:21:37,060 --> 00:21:38,060
 Yeah.

535
00:21:38,060 --> 00:21:40,600
 I don't know whether they do the poo for individual numbers or whether they're just like, here's

536
00:21:40,600 --> 00:21:41,600
 a colony.

537
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:42,600
 I see.

538
00:21:42,600 --> 00:21:43,600
 That's generally there.

539
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:45,760
 You can actually see like a little shadow.

540
00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:46,760
 That's how good the satellites are.

541
00:21:46,760 --> 00:21:51,540
 You can see, and they're so tall that you can see a penguin's shadow in the satellite images

542
00:21:51,540 --> 00:21:52,940
 and then for count each individual.

543
00:21:52,940 --> 00:21:53,940
 Yeah.

544
00:21:53,940 --> 00:21:57,060
 And actually, I think one really interesting thing is you can tell how many individuals

545
00:21:57,060 --> 00:22:01,740
 there are in one of these huddles by knowing the size of the huddle and the temperature

546
00:22:01,740 --> 00:22:06,100
 outside because they're really mathematically precise.

547
00:22:06,100 --> 00:22:07,260
 They go into like hexagons.

548
00:22:07,260 --> 00:22:10,300
 You know how hexagons are the best way at packing things?

549
00:22:10,300 --> 00:22:14,400
 If you kind of take a big pile of penguins, you know how much they're huddling because

550
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:18,240
 you know how cold it is and you just put a load of hexagons on that grid, that's how

551
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:19,240
 many penguins there are.

552
00:22:19,240 --> 00:22:20,240
 Oh, what do you mean?

553
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:21,240
 If it's colder, they'll go closer.

554
00:22:21,240 --> 00:22:22,240
 That'll suddenly tend to amnesia.

555
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:23,240
 Yeah.

556
00:22:23,240 --> 00:22:26,000
 I don't know whether to be more impressed by scientists or penguins than that, as if

557
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,040
 working that out is unbelievable.

558
00:22:28,040 --> 00:22:29,600
 Then working it out as penguins is unbelievable.

559
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:31,000
 I'm just saying that's fine for everyone.

560
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:32,000
 They're really cool.

561
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:33,000
 Yeah.

562
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:39,880
 I didn't know that part of Scott's expedition was about penguin eggs, collecting penguin

563
00:22:39,880 --> 00:22:40,880
 eggs.

564
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:41,880
 So crazy.

565
00:22:41,880 --> 00:22:42,880
 It's Scott of the Antarctic.

566
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:43,880
 Yeah.

567
00:22:43,880 --> 00:22:44,880
 That one.

568
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:49,580
 So 1910 to 1913 is Teranova expedition, a lesser known part of it in I think 1911.

569
00:22:49,580 --> 00:22:50,580
 It's 11, yeah.

570
00:22:50,580 --> 00:22:55,760
 It was where three of them, so I think it was sort of the brainchild or the person who's

571
00:22:55,760 --> 00:22:59,820
 most passionate about it was Edward Wilson, who was Scott's second in command.

572
00:22:59,820 --> 00:23:04,900
 Then there was this other chap called Apsley Cherry Garrod, but they were there to go and

573
00:23:04,900 --> 00:23:08,780
 collect emperor penguin eggs, weren't they, because they believed it was going to be really

574
00:23:08,780 --> 00:23:09,780
 evolutionaryly important.

575
00:23:09,780 --> 00:23:10,780
 Yes, that's right.

576
00:23:10,780 --> 00:23:11,780
 A link between.

577
00:23:11,780 --> 00:23:12,780
 Yeah.

578
00:23:12,780 --> 00:23:15,520
 They thought they were the oldest birds, and that there was this theory of recapitulation,

579
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:20,240
 which totally fell out of favor, but the idea that an embryo retraces its evolutionary

580
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:22,160
 heritage of its ancestor.

581
00:23:22,160 --> 00:23:26,080
 So it would kind of basically start off in its egg as a little reptile, and then turn

582
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:28,120
 into a bird as it was growing.

583
00:23:28,120 --> 00:23:32,360
 And so it kind of totally comes back to this whole like crazy winters and the males with

584
00:23:32,360 --> 00:23:36,240
 the eggs on their feet, because the only way to get an egg with an embryo in it is to go

585
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:37,240
 in the middle of winter.

586
00:23:37,240 --> 00:23:38,240
 Absolutely.

587
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:39,240
 Come out.

588
00:23:39,240 --> 00:23:40,240
 Yeah.

589
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:42,260
 And not only is it freezing cold, of course, pitch dark.

590
00:23:42,260 --> 00:23:43,260
 Dark cold.

591
00:23:43,260 --> 00:23:44,900
 They kept falling down like holes in the ice.

592
00:23:44,900 --> 00:23:45,900
 It was so ridiculous.

593
00:23:45,900 --> 00:23:48,860
 But then surely you've also got to fight an angry dad.

594
00:23:48,860 --> 00:23:51,820
 It started his fighting weight, though, isn't it, at that stage?

595
00:23:51,820 --> 00:23:52,820
 Exactly.

596
00:23:52,820 --> 00:23:55,580
 So the three of them went, and then the three survived, but Cherry Garrod got back, and

597
00:23:55,580 --> 00:24:00,340
 he was so ill from this expedition that he didn't go on the bit to the south pole, which

598
00:24:00,340 --> 00:24:03,100
 is where Fowers and Wilson died with Scott.

599
00:24:03,100 --> 00:24:04,100
 Right.

600
00:24:04,100 --> 00:24:07,180
 But they did get the penguin eggs, but I mean, it sounds extraordinary.

601
00:24:07,180 --> 00:24:12,040
 So Cherry's teeth shattered so violently with the cold that they shattered, apparently.

602
00:24:12,040 --> 00:24:14,880
 Do you know how they kept warm as well?

603
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:15,880
 How?

604
00:24:15,880 --> 00:24:16,880
 By burning penguins.

605
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:17,880
 That's dark.

606
00:24:17,880 --> 00:24:18,880
 That's very dark.

607
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:19,880
 How you do what you can.

608
00:24:19,880 --> 00:24:24,860
 I thought you'd say they had a lovely hug and a cuddle together, and now, oh, I'm not

609
00:24:24,860 --> 00:24:28,980
 hugging you, I'm going to burn this penguin.

610
00:24:28,980 --> 00:24:31,020
 I mean, that was when they went to the colony.

611
00:24:31,020 --> 00:24:36,320
 They grabbed a whole bunch of eggs, and they took some adult males, and they burnt them,

612
00:24:36,320 --> 00:24:37,320
 because they're really oily.

613
00:24:37,320 --> 00:24:38,320
 Yeah.

614
00:24:38,320 --> 00:24:40,180
 I was going to say, like, scuers, they burn quite well, don't they?

615
00:24:40,180 --> 00:24:41,180
 How do they?

616
00:24:41,180 --> 00:24:42,180
 They use those as lamps in Scotland.

617
00:24:42,180 --> 00:24:43,180
 Oh, they stick it.

618
00:24:43,180 --> 00:24:44,700
 Yeah, they stick a wick up there.

619
00:24:44,700 --> 00:24:45,700
 But yeah.

620
00:24:45,700 --> 00:24:50,580
 I mean, how strong are your ethical principles when you are near the south pole, and suddenly

621
00:24:50,580 --> 00:24:52,420
 you realise it's death or penguin burning?

622
00:24:52,420 --> 00:24:53,420
 In the name.

623
00:24:53,420 --> 00:24:54,420
 It was a couple of penguins.

624
00:24:54,420 --> 00:24:55,420
 Yeah.

625
00:24:55,420 --> 00:25:00,980
 It was, so it took him 45 minutes each night to chip into his frozen sleeping bag.

626
00:25:00,980 --> 00:25:04,620
 They probably burnt, like, the novels that they brought with them in the finish before

627
00:25:04,620 --> 00:25:06,120
 they burnt the penguin.

628
00:25:06,120 --> 00:25:07,120
 Yeah, probably.

629
00:25:07,120 --> 00:25:10,680
 I mean, not the dickens, because you need to keep holding the best ones.

630
00:25:10,680 --> 00:25:13,480
 Sorry, it took 45 minutes to chip into his sleeping bag.

631
00:25:13,480 --> 00:25:16,800
 Each night it would be a block of ice, and he said 45 minutes.

632
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:20,440
 And all I've got is one of these pieces of my own tooth to chip away with.

633
00:25:20,440 --> 00:25:21,920
 Oh, my God.

634
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:22,920
 That sounds...

635
00:25:22,920 --> 00:25:23,920
 Yeah.

636
00:25:23,920 --> 00:25:24,920
 Well, I'm going to bed.

637
00:25:24,920 --> 00:25:25,920
 You're going to bed early.

638
00:25:25,920 --> 00:25:26,920
 Yeah.

639
00:25:26,920 --> 00:25:27,920
 Yeah, I...

640
00:25:27,920 --> 00:25:28,920
 Got the old sleeping bag chipping to do.

641
00:25:28,920 --> 00:25:32,560
 There was also a thing where they had three sleds, I think, but they could only pull one

642
00:25:32,560 --> 00:25:33,640
 at a time.

643
00:25:33,640 --> 00:25:37,700
 So for every sort of mile they travelled, they had to do three back and forth.

644
00:25:37,700 --> 00:25:38,700
 Oh, my God.

645
00:25:38,700 --> 00:25:39,700
 Oh, my God.

646
00:25:39,700 --> 00:25:42,540
 And they couldn't leave the chicken on the sled at the same time as the crane.

647
00:25:42,540 --> 00:25:50,300
 I think we've got a penguin, an octopus, and a dolphin.

648
00:25:50,300 --> 00:25:59,000
 OK, it is time for fact number three, and that is Andy.

649
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:03,580
 My fact is that when Queen Elizabeth II got married, the people of Levington Spa clubbed

650
00:26:03,580 --> 00:26:05,680
 together and bought her a washing machine.

651
00:26:05,680 --> 00:26:06,680
 Oh.

652
00:26:06,680 --> 00:26:07,680
 Yeah.

653
00:26:07,680 --> 00:26:08,680
 That's nice.

654
00:26:08,680 --> 00:26:09,680
 It's very nice.

655
00:26:09,680 --> 00:26:10,680
 Clumped together?

656
00:26:10,680 --> 00:26:13,600
 How expensive was the washing machine, or how little did each individual in Levington

657
00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:14,600
 Spa contribute?

658
00:26:14,600 --> 00:26:15,600
 Wow.

659
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:16,600
 Wow.

660
00:26:16,600 --> 00:26:18,600
 Well, I'm sorry, but that's less than one penny, just isn't it?

661
00:26:18,600 --> 00:26:20,100
 Why do you take in everyone?

662
00:26:20,100 --> 00:26:23,000
 I'm sure they were more expensive in 1947, I guess.

663
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:24,000
 Yeah.

664
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:25,000
 Yeah.

665
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:29,800
 It was also a time famously of massive deprivation after the war, and bread was rationed at this

666
00:26:29,800 --> 00:26:30,800
 point.

667
00:26:30,800 --> 00:26:33,180
 They all used their ration cards to buy her a washing machine.

668
00:26:33,180 --> 00:26:34,520
 Did she have one already?

669
00:26:34,520 --> 00:26:35,520
 Unclear.

670
00:26:35,520 --> 00:26:38,600
 I think out of diplomacy, she was a famously diplomatic woman.

671
00:26:38,600 --> 00:26:42,160
 She would never have said, "I actually have 16 washing machines in my different houses

672
00:26:42,160 --> 00:26:43,160
 everywhere."

673
00:26:43,160 --> 00:26:44,160
 Yeah.

674
00:26:44,160 --> 00:26:48,280
 So she was Princess Elizabeth at the time, because she wasn't yet Queen.

675
00:26:48,280 --> 00:26:50,880
 That's how it works.

676
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:54,000
 And 1947, post-war, really poor time.

677
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:57,280
 So lots of gifts were food, you know?

678
00:26:57,280 --> 00:26:58,280
 Wow.

679
00:26:58,280 --> 00:26:59,680
 And gifts from around the world.

680
00:26:59,680 --> 00:27:04,980
 She got given lots of dresses, most of which she gave away to other girls getting married

681
00:27:04,980 --> 00:27:06,780
 around her age around the same time.

682
00:27:06,780 --> 00:27:07,780
 That's cool.

683
00:27:07,780 --> 00:27:08,780
 Yeah.

684
00:27:08,780 --> 00:27:12,540
 The list of wedding presents, this is so weird, was published as a book, and you can buy it

685
00:27:12,540 --> 00:27:16,460
 today, and I have ordered it, and it hasn't been delivered yet.

686
00:27:16,460 --> 00:27:20,740
 So tune in next week, we're going to be doing the same thing again.

687
00:27:20,740 --> 00:27:21,740
 Wow.

688
00:27:21,740 --> 00:27:22,740
 Yeah.

689
00:27:22,740 --> 00:27:25,540
 But it's just weird present, like 500 cases of tin pineapple?

690
00:27:25,540 --> 00:27:28,260
 Can you guys do that much pineapple in your life?

691
00:27:28,260 --> 00:27:29,260
 I don't think I could.

692
00:27:29,260 --> 00:27:30,260
 No, I mean either.

693
00:27:30,260 --> 00:27:31,260
 There's the Governor of Queensland sent that.

694
00:27:31,260 --> 00:27:32,760
 I haven't had one tin this year.

695
00:27:32,760 --> 00:27:33,760
 Haven't you?

696
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:34,760
 No.

697
00:27:34,760 --> 00:27:35,760
 Gosh.

698
00:27:35,760 --> 00:27:36,760
 Maybe after this.

699
00:27:36,760 --> 00:27:37,760
 Would you?

700
00:27:37,760 --> 00:27:40,060
 I think I had my first tin pineapple of the year yesterday.

701
00:27:40,060 --> 00:27:41,060
 That is a coincidence.

702
00:27:41,060 --> 00:27:42,060
 Wow.

703
00:27:42,060 --> 00:27:43,060
 Isn't it?

704
00:27:43,060 --> 00:27:44,060
 That bizarre.

705
00:27:44,060 --> 00:27:46,900
 Yes, it was part of a Panang curry.

706
00:27:46,900 --> 00:27:52,000
 People sent her stockings, which I find quite a personal thing to send someone.

707
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:55,760
 And she got over 100 pairs, I think, hundreds of pairs of nylon stockings, which were a high-value

708
00:27:55,760 --> 00:27:59,900
 item nylon was a newly invented thing.

709
00:27:59,900 --> 00:28:03,420
 What would the equivalent be to Bitcoin, probably?

710
00:28:03,420 --> 00:28:12,760
 The people of Lemmington Spa chip together to get you one dogecoin.

711
00:28:12,760 --> 00:28:16,980
 Royal wedding gifts are often quite weird, aren't they?

712
00:28:16,980 --> 00:28:21,940
 Grace Kelly, friend of the podcast, she got a yacht for a nice gift.

713
00:28:21,940 --> 00:28:22,940
 Oh yeah.

714
00:28:22,940 --> 00:28:23,940
 Yes, please.

715
00:28:23,940 --> 00:28:26,440
 Yeah, which village clumped together to buy it?

716
00:28:26,440 --> 00:28:27,440
 Yeah.

717
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:28,440
 It's better than washing machine, isn't it?

718
00:28:28,440 --> 00:28:31,960
 The interesting thing about that is it was a repurposed ship.

719
00:28:31,960 --> 00:28:37,680
 It was a yacht, and then it got turned into a ship for the war, and was used at Dunkirk

720
00:28:37,680 --> 00:28:40,320
 to help evacuate soldiers.

721
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:44,240
 And then after the war, Anasis bought it again and turned it back into a yacht, and then gave

722
00:28:44,240 --> 00:28:46,240
 it to Grace Kelly as a wedding gift.

723
00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:49,720
 That's sort of recycling, sort of.

724
00:28:49,720 --> 00:28:54,340
 Sorry, which bin does this yacht go in?

725
00:28:54,340 --> 00:28:56,900
 Oh, that's great.

726
00:28:56,900 --> 00:28:58,300
 That's much better than the one I felt.

727
00:28:58,300 --> 00:29:02,080
 Prince Charles and Diana, when they got married, a council in Somerset said, "One tonne of

728
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:03,080
 peat."

729
00:29:03,080 --> 00:29:04,080
 Oh.

730
00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:09,900
 He's a farmer, and you know, he's not a farmer as he, but he owns lots of farmers.

731
00:29:09,900 --> 00:29:12,140
 Yeah, but do you know that was a huge faux pas, really?

732
00:29:12,140 --> 00:29:13,140
 Oh yeah.

733
00:29:13,140 --> 00:29:16,060
 Sending excrement to a wedding is not a faux pas.

734
00:29:16,060 --> 00:29:17,060
 Oh, peat isn't excrement.

735
00:29:17,060 --> 00:29:18,060
 It's not excrement.

736
00:29:18,060 --> 00:29:19,060
 I need to do some basic lessons.

737
00:29:19,060 --> 00:29:20,060
 It is.

738
00:29:20,060 --> 00:29:21,060
 It was Sedgemoor District Council.

739
00:29:21,060 --> 00:29:24,480
 They sent him a tonne of peat, and this was exactly about the time that Charles was banning

740
00:29:24,480 --> 00:29:28,640
 peat, because he is very environmentally aware and has been for a very long time.

741
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:33,740
 And in the ATC banned peat use on all of his farms, because, you know, it's a big biodiversity

742
00:29:33,740 --> 00:29:34,740
 area now.

743
00:29:34,740 --> 00:29:35,740
 Yeah, peat-free compost all that.

744
00:29:35,740 --> 00:29:36,740
 Yeah.

745
00:29:36,740 --> 00:29:38,240
 Also, it sequesters a lot of carbon, doesn't it?

746
00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:39,240
 Yeah.

747
00:29:39,240 --> 00:29:42,480
 Yes, although he knew that at the time, but he was very, you know, he predicted.

748
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:45,760
 So, Sedgemoor, he screwed up, and that's...

749
00:29:45,760 --> 00:29:49,740
 One nice wedding gift I found is something that people get in Japan called the Venus

750
00:29:49,740 --> 00:29:50,740
 Flower Basket.

751
00:29:50,740 --> 00:29:51,740
 Oh, yes.

752
00:29:51,740 --> 00:29:52,740
 Do you know it?

753
00:29:52,740 --> 00:29:53,740
 I know this one, yeah.

754
00:29:53,740 --> 00:29:54,740
 Go on.

755
00:29:54,740 --> 00:29:55,740
 Tell us what it is.

756
00:29:55,740 --> 00:30:00,060
 So, it's a deep sea sponge that's a glass sponge that they made out of kind of silica,

757
00:30:00,060 --> 00:30:01,060
 basically.

758
00:30:01,060 --> 00:30:06,980
 They look like a very ornate stocking, so a bit sort of like a woven knitted stocking.

759
00:30:06,980 --> 00:30:10,540
 And then there are these shrimp that live inside them, and they get inside them when

760
00:30:10,540 --> 00:30:14,820
 they're larvae, so they can sort of go through the holes of this glassy sponge thing.

761
00:30:14,820 --> 00:30:18,420
 And then they get trapped, and so, basically, you have a male and a female that are trapped

762
00:30:18,420 --> 00:30:20,840
 inside this sponge and can't get out.

763
00:30:20,840 --> 00:30:23,460
 And that's like a marriage.

764
00:30:23,460 --> 00:30:24,460
 Exactly.

765
00:30:24,460 --> 00:30:25,460
 Exactly.

766
00:30:25,460 --> 00:30:28,940
 And they send their babies off into the world through the holes of their sponge, but they

767
00:30:28,940 --> 00:30:30,440
 stay their entire life inside this sponge.

768
00:30:30,440 --> 00:30:31,440
 Yeah, it is that.

769
00:30:31,440 --> 00:30:34,440
 It's because, like, the male and the female stay together the rest of their lives, isn't

770
00:30:34,440 --> 00:30:35,440
 it?

771
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:37,880
 Well, it's a claustrophobic concept of marriage, isn't it?

772
00:30:37,880 --> 00:30:42,720
 Well, I also found this, like, because it's like this glass sponge is like in a framework,

773
00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:43,720
 isn't it?

774
00:30:43,720 --> 00:30:44,720
 It's like a lattice.

775
00:30:44,720 --> 00:30:49,820
 They found that the currents go into it, and they create, like, a little vortex, and it

776
00:30:49,820 --> 00:30:54,960
 means that when the male and the female release their sperm and eggs, it's the perfect vortex

777
00:30:54,960 --> 00:30:56,940
 to make them all sort of mixed together.

778
00:30:56,940 --> 00:30:57,940
 Oh, cool.

779
00:30:57,940 --> 00:30:59,440
 That's quite romantic as well, isn't it?

780
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:00,440
 It is.

781
00:31:00,440 --> 00:31:01,440
 It's lovely.

782
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:07,940
 I've heard as well that they designed the gherkin in London around the skyscraper, around this

783
00:31:07,940 --> 00:31:13,520
 sort of shape of a sponge as well, and it was like, rather than water and other things,

784
00:31:13,520 --> 00:31:14,520
 circulating around it.

785
00:31:14,520 --> 00:31:17,160
 It's for air conditioning, and it pulls the air in, and it goes up the building.

786
00:31:17,160 --> 00:31:21,760
 Do not release sperm around the gherkin if you're looking for love.

787
00:31:21,760 --> 00:31:23,760
 Just to see what happens.

788
00:31:23,760 --> 00:31:29,120
 The building security and the cleaning team will both be the fact.

789
00:31:29,120 --> 00:31:30,120
 That's so interesting.

790
00:31:30,120 --> 00:31:31,120
 Wow.

791
00:31:31,120 --> 00:31:32,120
 That's very cool.

792
00:31:32,120 --> 00:31:33,120
 Yeah.

793
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:34,120
 Will you do a washing machine thing or two?

794
00:31:34,120 --> 00:31:35,120
 No, washing machines.

795
00:31:35,120 --> 00:31:36,120
 Yeah.

796
00:31:36,120 --> 00:31:37,120
 They're bad.

797
00:31:37,120 --> 00:31:38,120
 Are they?

798
00:31:38,120 --> 00:31:40,080
 Yeah, washing machines are bad.

799
00:31:40,080 --> 00:31:47,320
 Classic cloth washing accounts for 35% of primary microplastics found in the environment, and

800
00:31:47,320 --> 00:31:52,960
 they're trying to come up with a law where all new washing machines have to have a filter

801
00:31:52,960 --> 00:31:53,960
 in them.

802
00:31:53,960 --> 00:31:57,880
 It's already the law in France, I think, but at the moment it's not the law in the UK,

803
00:31:57,880 --> 00:31:59,160
 and it needs to be the law in the UK.

804
00:31:59,160 --> 00:32:02,360
 Does that stop the microplastics getting out and into the water system?

805
00:32:02,360 --> 00:32:03,360
 Yeah.

806
00:32:03,360 --> 00:32:04,360
 That's a filter, yeah.

807
00:32:04,360 --> 00:32:06,840
 When you say synthetic fabrics, I've got a ...

808
00:32:06,840 --> 00:32:09,760
 That T-shirt you're wearing, I would say ... Oh, it's cotton, I guess.

809
00:32:09,760 --> 00:32:14,400
 No, I think you're talking more like fleeces and ... Yeah, like polyester.

810
00:32:14,400 --> 00:32:15,400
 Polyester.

811
00:32:15,400 --> 00:32:16,400
 Oh, okay.

812
00:32:16,400 --> 00:32:19,200
 Polyester fleeces are particularly bad because they just shed loads of fibres.

813
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:21,000
 Why would you ever wash a fleece?

814
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:22,000
 I mean, a good point.

815
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:23,000
 I think you don't.

816
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:24,000
 You don't, really.

817
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:25,000
 Next time don't.

818
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:29,280
 I'm at the school of like, if it's an outer layer, you never wash it.

819
00:32:29,280 --> 00:32:30,280
 No.

820
00:32:30,280 --> 00:32:31,280
 Unless you've fallen a swamp.

821
00:32:31,280 --> 00:32:32,280
 Oh, yeah.

822
00:32:32,280 --> 00:32:35,000
 And if you're wearing your fleece, you might be ... What if a bird poo's on you?

823
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:36,000
 Oh, yeah.

824
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:37,000
 Just wipe it.

825
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:40,480
 Wait until it's dry and then a stiff, ah, hog's back with a brush.

826
00:32:40,480 --> 00:32:41,480
 Yeah, honestly.

827
00:32:41,480 --> 00:32:45,520
 Do you know that the first fleeces were called synthetic chinchillas?

828
00:32:45,520 --> 00:32:46,520
 No, stop it.

829
00:32:46,520 --> 00:32:47,520
 Yeah, yeah.

830
00:32:47,520 --> 00:32:48,520
 I think that's right.

831
00:32:48,520 --> 00:32:49,520
 When was that?

832
00:32:49,520 --> 00:32:50,520
 When.

833
00:32:50,520 --> 00:32:51,520
 Yeah, roughly.

834
00:32:51,520 --> 00:32:52,520
 20th century.

835
00:32:52,520 --> 00:32:53,520
 Get away.

836
00:32:53,520 --> 00:32:54,520
 20th century, yeah.

837
00:32:54,520 --> 00:32:55,520
 Because before that, people were wearing chinchillas.

838
00:32:55,520 --> 00:32:56,520
 Real chinchilla.

839
00:32:56,520 --> 00:32:57,520
 Yeah.

840
00:32:57,520 --> 00:33:01,600
 I think chinchilla was a name of a fabric that was kind of similar to what a chinchilla

841
00:33:01,600 --> 00:33:04,680
 was, but it was like, it was made of cotton, but it was called chinchilla.

842
00:33:04,680 --> 00:33:05,680
 That's funny.

843
00:33:05,680 --> 00:33:06,680
 And then there's the synthetic chinchilla.

844
00:33:06,680 --> 00:33:07,680
 I think that's right.

845
00:33:07,680 --> 00:33:08,680
 That's amazing.

846
00:33:08,680 --> 00:33:10,840
 I run it because actually they're sort of chin-warmers, aren't they?

847
00:33:10,840 --> 00:33:11,840
 That's very right.

848
00:33:11,840 --> 00:33:12,840
 Yeah.

849
00:33:12,840 --> 00:33:13,840
 Gas.

850
00:33:13,840 --> 00:33:14,840
 Gas.

851
00:33:14,840 --> 00:33:15,840
 Good grief.

852
00:33:15,840 --> 00:33:16,840
 Can I tell you a washing machine fact?

853
00:33:16,840 --> 00:33:17,840
 Yeah.

854
00:33:17,840 --> 00:33:18,840
 Sure.

855
00:33:18,840 --> 00:33:19,840
 This is good.

856
00:33:19,840 --> 00:33:20,840
 So you know the Samsung jingle?

857
00:33:20,840 --> 00:33:21,840
 The Samsung jingle.

858
00:33:21,840 --> 00:33:22,840
 No?

859
00:33:22,840 --> 00:33:23,840
 That's not one of the things.

860
00:33:23,840 --> 00:33:25,840
 When you're washing machine finishes, it plays a little tune.

861
00:33:25,840 --> 00:33:26,840
 Samsung.

862
00:33:26,840 --> 00:33:27,840
 Is this the Samsung?

863
00:33:27,840 --> 00:33:28,840
 Yeah.

864
00:33:28,840 --> 00:33:29,840
 No, I don't know it.

865
00:33:29,840 --> 00:33:30,840
 Yeah, there's a tune.

866
00:33:30,840 --> 00:33:31,840
 Well, lots of washing machines.

867
00:33:31,840 --> 00:33:33,960
 My washing machine just goes beep, beep, beep, and it's finished.

868
00:33:33,960 --> 00:33:36,800
 Does it go dum, dum, dum, or something like that?

869
00:33:36,800 --> 00:33:37,800
 Nope.

870
00:33:37,800 --> 00:33:38,800
 No.

871
00:33:38,800 --> 00:33:39,800
 That's an announcement on the underground.

872
00:33:39,800 --> 00:33:40,800
 I think.

873
00:33:40,800 --> 00:33:41,800
 Yeah.

874
00:33:41,800 --> 00:33:44,640
 I installed the wrong thing in my kitchen.

875
00:33:44,640 --> 00:33:49,640
 Is the one that goes dum, dum, dum, dum, dum, dum, dum, dum, dum, dum, dum, dum, dum,

876
00:33:49,640 --> 00:33:50,640
 dum, dum, dum, dum.

877
00:33:50,640 --> 00:33:51,640
 Really?

878
00:33:51,640 --> 00:33:52,640
 Really?

879
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:53,640
 I don't know.

880
00:33:53,640 --> 00:33:54,640
 And it's really long, right?

881
00:33:54,640 --> 00:33:55,640
 So this is so mad.

882
00:33:55,640 --> 00:33:56,640
 It was composed in 1817.

883
00:33:56,640 --> 00:33:57,640
 The Samsung washing machine jingle.

884
00:33:57,640 --> 00:33:58,640
 For this.

885
00:33:58,640 --> 00:33:59,640
 For this in mind.

886
00:33:59,640 --> 00:34:00,640
 For this.

887
00:34:00,640 --> 00:34:01,640
 It's Franz Schubert.

888
00:34:01,640 --> 00:34:02,640
 Wow.

889
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:03,640
 I know.

890
00:34:03,640 --> 00:34:04,640
 It's a song.

891
00:34:04,640 --> 00:34:05,640
 It's called The Trout.

892
00:34:05,640 --> 00:34:06,640
 So there's an aquatic theme.

893
00:34:06,640 --> 00:34:07,640
 Oh, OK.

894
00:34:07,640 --> 00:34:11,600
 And it's based on a poem, a different, confusingly, a German writer called Schubert.

895
00:34:11,600 --> 00:34:12,600
 Wow.

896
00:34:12,600 --> 00:34:17,800
 And it's about a trout that gets caught by a fisherman, and it's a warning to young women

897
00:34:17,800 --> 00:34:19,160
 to stay away from men.

898
00:34:19,160 --> 00:34:20,320
 Well, there you are.

899
00:34:20,320 --> 00:34:21,320
 Yeah.

900
00:34:21,320 --> 00:34:25,000
 And this is the tune that is in every Samsung washing machine, and it's a little sort of

901
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:28,880
 ceremonial ditty that plays at the end of, and I have one of those washing machines.

902
00:34:28,880 --> 00:34:31,000
 I hear that tune a couple of times a week.

903
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:35,080
 Your wife leaves the house.

904
00:34:35,080 --> 00:34:38,200
 What a multi-layered fact there are so many bits to grasp there.

905
00:34:38,200 --> 00:34:41,440
 Well, I mean, to start off with, I didn't know Samsung made washing machines.

906
00:34:41,440 --> 00:34:43,520
 I thought they made TVs.

907
00:34:43,520 --> 00:34:44,520
 Right.

908
00:34:44,520 --> 00:34:45,520
 That's the foothills of this fact.

909
00:34:45,520 --> 00:34:46,520
 Yeah.

910
00:34:46,520 --> 00:34:47,520
 Schubert and Schubert.

911
00:34:47,520 --> 00:34:51,320
 I want to know about that comedy double up.

912
00:34:51,320 --> 00:34:53,960
 Can I ask you guys a question about your washing machines?

913
00:34:53,960 --> 00:34:56,240
 How much washing powder do you tend to put in?

914
00:34:56,240 --> 00:35:00,760
 I just put one of those, like, you know, those tide pod things that Americans eat.

915
00:35:00,760 --> 00:35:01,760
 I put one of those.

916
00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:04,760
 Oh, you do the tide pod.

917
00:35:04,760 --> 00:35:05,960
 Yeah, just a scoop.

918
00:35:05,960 --> 00:35:06,960
 I don't use powder.

919
00:35:06,960 --> 00:35:07,960
 I use liquid.

920
00:35:07,960 --> 00:35:08,960
 Nice.

921
00:35:08,960 --> 00:35:10,480
 From a refill shop.

922
00:35:10,480 --> 00:35:11,480
 Well done.

923
00:35:11,480 --> 00:35:12,480
 For the on message.

924
00:35:12,480 --> 00:35:13,960
 Yeah, just a cup of that.

925
00:35:13,960 --> 00:35:14,960
 Oh, okay.

926
00:35:14,960 --> 00:35:15,960
 A lid.

927
00:35:15,960 --> 00:35:20,520
 Good, but I'm afraid it's not quite as good as the old reusable egg full of dry granules

928
00:35:20,520 --> 00:35:21,520
 that I use.

929
00:35:21,520 --> 00:35:22,520
 Oh!

930
00:35:22,520 --> 00:35:23,520
 I've got one of those.

931
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:26,640
 You do have to fly down to the Antarctic to get the egg, don't you?

932
00:35:26,640 --> 00:35:31,680
 That's why I've lost all these teeth in front teeth of mine.

933
00:35:31,680 --> 00:35:32,880
 Is that right?

934
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:33,880
 You wash with a reusable egg.

935
00:35:33,880 --> 00:35:37,640
 There's a little plastic egg, which is full of dry granules, and they last about, like,

936
00:35:37,640 --> 00:35:40,800
 a hundred washes or something, and you just replace those dry granules.

937
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:42,480
 I wondered why you spelt so bad.

938
00:35:42,480 --> 00:35:44,840
 Like, it works, it's really good.

939
00:35:44,840 --> 00:35:49,520
 That's a much better public service announcement than mine, which is if you're just using normal

940
00:35:49,520 --> 00:35:54,480
 washing powder, you should never need to use more than really a tablespoon, which is much,

941
00:35:54,480 --> 00:35:56,320
 much less than you're probably using.

942
00:35:56,320 --> 00:36:00,600
 This is a New York Times expose, and it's really bad to overuse it because it makes your clothes

943
00:36:00,600 --> 00:36:01,600
 go all crunchy.

944
00:36:01,600 --> 00:36:06,800
 Can I ask Anna, as someone who has a toddler who's currently potty training, and so I often

945
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:11,120
 have urine and feces stains on my clothing, is it different for me?

946
00:36:11,120 --> 00:36:15,520
 It says for extremely heavy loads, you might want two tablespoons, but you're never going

947
00:36:15,520 --> 00:36:17,040
 to need more than that.

948
00:36:17,040 --> 00:36:18,040
 Thank you.

949
00:36:18,040 --> 00:36:21,160
 And they're lying to you, the companies, with their cups on the list because they just want

950
00:36:21,160 --> 00:36:22,160
 to get through it.

951
00:36:22,160 --> 00:36:23,160
 Exactly, and they keep a little scoop, don't they?

952
00:36:23,160 --> 00:36:24,600
 Oh, it's in their interest.

953
00:36:24,600 --> 00:36:25,600
 Yeah.

954
00:36:25,600 --> 00:36:26,600
 There you go.

955
00:36:26,600 --> 00:36:27,600
 Big core, big powder.

956
00:36:27,600 --> 00:36:31,080
 But, because I've always thought the whole thing's a scam, and what I've always thought

957
00:36:31,080 --> 00:36:34,200
 is the whole washing clothes thing, it's a scam.

958
00:36:34,200 --> 00:36:37,880
 The thing I've always thought is the drawer thing, got to be a scam, so I've always put

959
00:36:37,880 --> 00:36:38,880
 everything in the drum.

960
00:36:38,880 --> 00:36:39,880
 Yeah, I do that as well.

961
00:36:39,880 --> 00:36:43,080
 Well, what I've realized, if you use fabric softener, if you put that in the drum, which

962
00:36:43,080 --> 00:36:48,600
 I always have done, it's completely pointless, and it's because it's to do with the charging

963
00:36:48,600 --> 00:36:49,600
 of it.

964
00:36:49,600 --> 00:36:52,880
 So fabric softener is partly there to stop your static clothes sticking together, and

965
00:36:52,880 --> 00:36:56,920
 it does that by being positively charged so that the negatively charged clothes bind with

966
00:36:56,920 --> 00:36:58,420
 it and become neutralized.

967
00:36:58,420 --> 00:37:03,320
 So there you go, that's kind of what it does, but it has the opposite charge to your washing

968
00:37:03,320 --> 00:37:07,480
 powder, so if you put them in at the same time in the drum, they cancel each other out,

969
00:37:07,480 --> 00:37:09,280
 and it doesn't do any good.

970
00:37:09,280 --> 00:37:14,240
 So if you are like me, and you're just tipping your fabric softener in the drum, stop it,

971
00:37:14,240 --> 00:37:16,560
 and stop using all of it and be more ethical like these guys.

972
00:37:16,560 --> 00:37:17,560
 Get the egg.

973
00:37:17,560 --> 00:37:18,560
 Get the plaster.

974
00:37:18,560 --> 00:37:19,560
 I swear, get the egg in the granules.

975
00:37:19,560 --> 00:37:20,560
 Get the giant penguin egg.

976
00:37:20,560 --> 00:37:21,560
 Yeah.

977
00:37:21,560 --> 00:37:22,560
 Get it in the washing machine.

978
00:37:22,560 --> 00:37:23,560
 Yeah.

979
00:37:23,560 --> 00:37:24,560
 Wow.

980
00:37:24,560 --> 00:37:25,560
 Yeah.

981
00:37:25,560 --> 00:37:26,880
 I'm going to study one wedding present thing.

982
00:37:26,880 --> 00:37:31,720
 So it's based on a fact I discovered, which is that in 2015, Cristiano Ronaldo bought his

983
00:37:31,720 --> 00:37:36,440
 agent, George Mendes and his wife, Sandra, Greek Island as the present.

984
00:37:36,440 --> 00:37:37,440
 So they're best friends.

985
00:37:37,440 --> 00:37:39,960
 I think he was best man at his wedding, or vice versa.

986
00:37:39,960 --> 00:37:43,680
 So they're very close, health sweet, bought in the Greek Island, and I was just like,

987
00:37:43,680 --> 00:37:45,680
 how do you buy someone a Greek Island?

988
00:37:45,680 --> 00:37:51,520
 And do you know this website called privateislandsonline.com, which just has loads of islands for

989
00:37:51,520 --> 00:37:52,520
 sale.

990
00:37:52,520 --> 00:37:56,640
 And this, when Greece went through the credit crunch, I didn't realise, but lots of economists

991
00:37:56,640 --> 00:38:00,480
 advise, and eventually they went with it, advise that they put up a bunch of their islands

992
00:38:00,480 --> 00:38:02,720
 for sale to make back some of the money.

993
00:38:02,720 --> 00:38:04,840
 I have been on this website, I think.

994
00:38:04,840 --> 00:38:06,320
 Have you got an island?

995
00:38:06,320 --> 00:38:12,200
 No, I think like if memory serves, you go on, and it's like some of them are like not beyond

996
00:38:12,200 --> 00:38:16,800
 the realms of possibility of someone like me could buy, but it's always like a tiny island

997
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:24,280
 in a lock, in the northernmost part of Scotland, and it says no electricity, no water, no ability

998
00:38:24,280 --> 00:38:25,280
 to get to the island.

999
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:30,200
 Well, you know, you'd be living a little bit off-grid, yes, but I still think the cheapest

1000
00:38:30,200 --> 00:38:33,960
 Greek one I found was five million US dollars.

1001
00:38:33,960 --> 00:38:35,320
 So if, you know...

1002
00:38:35,320 --> 00:38:36,320
 If we all club together...

1003
00:38:36,320 --> 00:38:40,520
 If those bastards in Levington's bar actually chipped in, and dug deep.

1004
00:38:40,520 --> 00:38:44,720
 Maybe, I don't know what the mortgage offers are on this.

1005
00:38:44,720 --> 00:38:48,680
 It's Strogillo Island, or Strogillo Island, it's got beaches around the edge.

1006
00:38:48,680 --> 00:38:52,120
 OK, here we are, no such thing as a fish island.

1007
00:38:52,120 --> 00:38:56,720
 Everyone is listening, chips in a bit, and everyone gets to go there.

1008
00:38:56,720 --> 00:38:57,720
 OK, lovely.

1009
00:38:57,720 --> 00:38:58,720
 I love it, let's do it.

1010
00:38:58,720 --> 00:39:02,440
 We can get five million dollars, it's 54 acres, so we could all fit.

1011
00:39:02,440 --> 00:39:05,480
 Is there anything on it?

1012
00:39:05,480 --> 00:39:08,200
 Some trees, it's very green, it's very verdant.

1013
00:39:08,200 --> 00:39:09,200
 Sounds lovely.

1014
00:39:09,200 --> 00:39:12,960
 Oh, and it's got power in some, I mean...

1015
00:39:12,960 --> 00:39:13,960
 The power station.

1016
00:39:13,960 --> 00:39:18,640
 There is a new clear power station in the middle, and it had a little hiccup a few years ago,

1017
00:39:18,640 --> 00:39:20,400
 but honestly, it's fine.

1018
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:22,640
 It's fine, it's fine.

1019
00:39:22,640 --> 00:39:25,720
 Anyway, just something to bear in mind, I think.

1020
00:39:25,720 --> 00:39:27,000
 Yes, get that kickstart to go.

1021
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:28,000
 Yeah, I think I will.

1022
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:29,000
 Get an island.

1023
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:30,000
 Lovely.

1024
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:32,880
 Can I do animal gifts, wedding gifts?

1025
00:39:32,880 --> 00:39:35,560
 Can we do this quickly?

1026
00:39:35,560 --> 00:39:38,480
 Technically known as not-pretty-all-gifts, and there are lots of animals that give each

1027
00:39:38,480 --> 00:39:40,600
 other a presence before mating.

1028
00:39:40,600 --> 00:39:43,600
 Did you know about this?

1029
00:39:43,600 --> 00:39:49,240
 So, usually the males, occasionally it's females that offer something, and it's usually food.

1030
00:39:49,240 --> 00:39:53,280
 But the really cool one I found was the nursery web spider.

1031
00:39:53,280 --> 00:39:57,580
 So the males approach the female and give her a gift of usually an insect, and he wraps

1032
00:39:57,580 --> 00:39:59,640
 them up in silk.

1033
00:39:59,640 --> 00:40:05,200
 And the females prefer the wrapped ones, they like the white, shiny, wrapped-up presents.

1034
00:40:05,200 --> 00:40:09,360
 But he'll give her the present, and she will open it and start eating it.

1035
00:40:09,360 --> 00:40:13,520
 And meanwhile, he's getting busy with what he needs to do, so they start mating while

1036
00:40:13,520 --> 00:40:18,480
 she's opening her present right there, and generally-

1037
00:40:18,480 --> 00:40:19,480
 She's awake.

1038
00:40:19,480 --> 00:40:21,480
 You just wait until I'm awake.

1039
00:40:21,480 --> 00:40:22,480
 No, no.

1040
00:40:22,480 --> 00:40:23,480
 It's sort of the whole point.

1041
00:40:23,480 --> 00:40:24,480
 And if she can-

1042
00:40:24,480 --> 00:40:25,480
 At least sing happy birthday.

1043
00:40:25,480 --> 00:40:26,480
 No, no.

1044
00:40:26,480 --> 00:40:27,480
 He's mating while she's-

1045
00:40:27,480 --> 00:40:32,520
 So she's opening the present, but basically, because it's wrapped up, he can cheat, and

1046
00:40:32,520 --> 00:40:34,440
 they don't always put something inside.

1047
00:40:34,440 --> 00:40:35,440
 No way.

1048
00:40:35,440 --> 00:40:36,440
 That's so funny.

1049
00:40:36,440 --> 00:40:37,440
 It's like deal or no deal.

1050
00:40:37,440 --> 00:40:38,440
 Yeah, yeah.

1051
00:40:38,440 --> 00:40:43,260
 So basically, some of them are like, "Well, I'll just put this whole piece of shit in

1052
00:40:43,260 --> 00:40:44,260
 here."

1053
00:40:44,260 --> 00:40:46,960
 No one's going to know until she's opened it, because it takes a bit of time.

1054
00:40:46,960 --> 00:40:50,080
 And if she opens it and she's like, "What is the-" Okay.

1055
00:40:50,080 --> 00:40:51,080
 And then basically-

1056
00:40:51,080 --> 00:40:52,080
 Too late.

1057
00:40:52,080 --> 00:40:53,080
 Too late.

1058
00:40:53,080 --> 00:40:54,080
 I've done enough.

1059
00:40:54,080 --> 00:40:55,080
 Yeah.

1060
00:40:55,080 --> 00:40:56,080
 And so then she'll be like, "No, off you get.

1061
00:40:56,080 --> 00:40:57,080
 We're going now."

1062
00:40:57,080 --> 00:40:58,080
 But the male-

1063
00:40:58,080 --> 00:40:59,080
 They also do a thing where-

1064
00:40:59,080 --> 00:41:00,680
 So Hickton, I mean, this is from the paper, actually.

1065
00:41:00,680 --> 00:41:03,360
 There's a study of this, and I just thought this is a lovely sentence.

1066
00:41:03,360 --> 00:41:08,720
 However, if the female moves and attempts to terminate the copulation, the male may

1067
00:41:08,720 --> 00:41:12,360
 perform Thanatosis, which is death-thaining behavior.

1068
00:41:12,360 --> 00:41:15,960
 He stretches out his legs, which is unique to this species.

1069
00:41:15,960 --> 00:41:22,120
 The male then ends the insertion and grasps the gift with his chelicerae, which was like

1070
00:41:22,120 --> 00:41:23,360
 mouth parts.

1071
00:41:23,360 --> 00:41:27,320
 And then the female moves away while holding onto the gift, and the male is dragged along

1072
00:41:27,320 --> 00:41:34,840
 behind the female until eventually she'll give up, and then he revives and resumes

1073
00:41:34,840 --> 00:41:35,840
 mating.

1074
00:41:35,840 --> 00:41:36,840
 Wait.

1075
00:41:36,840 --> 00:41:39,160
 Okay, I was going to ask what his end game is here, because I thought he was just trying

1076
00:41:39,160 --> 00:41:40,160
 to get the present back.

1077
00:41:40,160 --> 00:41:41,160
 Yeah, me too.

1078
00:41:41,160 --> 00:41:42,160
 Do we gift it?

1079
00:41:42,160 --> 00:41:44,360
 Well, I don't think we really know.

1080
00:41:44,360 --> 00:41:49,080
 I mean, his end game is to basically try and make it as long as possible, because the

1081
00:41:49,080 --> 00:41:52,160
 longer they go, the more chance they have of fertilizing.

1082
00:41:52,160 --> 00:41:53,160
 And so basically breaking-

1083
00:41:53,160 --> 00:41:56,400
 Like, giving her a crap present is not a great idea, because she will be like, "No,

1084
00:41:56,400 --> 00:41:58,320
 I'm going to stop now because there's nothing in here."

1085
00:41:58,320 --> 00:42:01,200
 And the better the present you get, the more time, but it seems that sometimes they just

1086
00:42:01,200 --> 00:42:04,360
 don't have anything, or they're really hungry, and they eat the gift first, so they take

1087
00:42:04,360 --> 00:42:08,280
 the insect, they eat it.

1088
00:42:08,280 --> 00:42:12,200
 Honestly, I did buy you a bottle of wine, but it was a long-training journey.

1089
00:42:12,200 --> 00:42:14,200
 Anyway, here's the bottle.

1090
00:42:14,200 --> 00:42:15,200
 Exactly.

1091
00:42:15,200 --> 00:42:17,760
 Hannah, stop mixing with me.

1092
00:42:17,760 --> 00:42:21,680
 And you never invited me back.

1093
00:42:21,680 --> 00:42:29,040
 Hannah fainting death to me, slunching the white bottle in her mouth.

1094
00:42:29,040 --> 00:42:37,480
 OK, it's time for our final fact, and that is James.

1095
00:42:37,480 --> 00:42:42,880
 OK, my fact this week is that hermit crabs are facing a housing crisis.

1096
00:42:42,880 --> 00:42:43,880
 Join the club.

1097
00:42:43,880 --> 00:42:44,880
 Oh, this is so sad.

1098
00:42:44,880 --> 00:42:45,880
 Sorry, Belle, everyone.

1099
00:42:45,880 --> 00:42:46,880
 Dink, dink, dink.

1100
00:42:46,880 --> 00:42:47,880
 What do you mean?

1101
00:42:47,880 --> 00:42:58,000
 I think it's relatively self-explanatory in that hermit crabs, as you might know, don't

1102
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:03,200
 have their own shells, so they go and find a new shell, and usually it's one that's discarded.

1103
00:43:03,200 --> 00:43:06,360
 But it turns out that there aren't as many shells as there used to be.

1104
00:43:06,360 --> 00:43:08,320
 There's various different reasons.

1105
00:43:08,320 --> 00:43:15,360
 One reason is because gastropods, shell creatures are shrinking, the populations are shrinking.

1106
00:43:15,360 --> 00:43:21,720
 But the paper's basically analysed photographs of crabs online and found--

1107
00:43:21,720 --> 00:43:23,240
 Social media pictures of hermit crabs.

1108
00:43:23,240 --> 00:43:24,240
 Pretty much, yeah.

1109
00:43:24,240 --> 00:43:29,000
 They basically went onto Instagram and looked for hermit crabs, and found loads of pictures

1110
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:32,880
 of them using bottle caps, soda cans, Lego bricks.

1111
00:43:32,880 --> 00:43:38,440
 A really scary bit is the broken end of a light bulb, so the metal bit that you screw

1112
00:43:38,440 --> 00:43:40,880
 in, they used that.

1113
00:43:40,880 --> 00:43:41,880
 Yeah.

1114
00:43:41,880 --> 00:43:44,200
 It's quite a few pictures of hermit crabs.

1115
00:43:44,200 --> 00:43:48,920
 I guess those are very durable in the ocean, I suppose, as they just last a lot of time,

1116
00:43:48,920 --> 00:43:49,920
 don't they?

1117
00:43:49,920 --> 00:43:52,200
 I think that's one of the other reasons they're doing it, just because it's what's there.

1118
00:43:52,200 --> 00:43:53,200
 Right.

1119
00:43:53,200 --> 00:43:54,200
 Yeah.

1120
00:43:54,200 --> 00:43:57,040
 And there was another study in 2019 that found that half a million hermit crabs are dying

1121
00:43:57,040 --> 00:44:00,440
 every year after getting stuck inside bottles and things like that.

1122
00:44:00,440 --> 00:44:02,720
 So it's bad news for hermit crabs.

1123
00:44:02,720 --> 00:44:03,720
 It is.

1124
00:44:03,720 --> 00:44:05,000
 I mean, it's kind of mad.

1125
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:11,400
 Apparently as well, this plastic starts to smell like dead crabs, and that's one reason

1126
00:44:11,400 --> 00:44:12,560
 why they come towards them.

1127
00:44:12,560 --> 00:44:16,840
 So there's this stuff called dimethyl sulfide, which is this molecule that does all sorts

1128
00:44:16,840 --> 00:44:20,240
 of important things like make clouds, and it comes off plankton in the ocean.

1129
00:44:20,240 --> 00:44:25,120
 But it also, it's like, it's the smell of a rotting crab, but it sticks to the outside

1130
00:44:25,120 --> 00:44:27,960
 of plastic stuff, plastic pollution in the ocean.

1131
00:44:27,960 --> 00:44:33,000
 So one reason, possibly, why these crabs are going for the Coke bottle lids and yogurt

1132
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:36,360
 pots is because they think it smells like a dead crab, and therefore it's a shell that's

1133
00:44:36,360 --> 00:44:39,440
 just been left behind by another crab.

1134
00:44:39,440 --> 00:44:40,600
 Because you would use that naturally.

1135
00:44:40,600 --> 00:44:41,600
 Yeah, yeah, exactly.

1136
00:44:41,600 --> 00:44:43,840
 So the thermocrabs will use whatever they can find.

1137
00:44:43,840 --> 00:44:48,840
 So in Madagascar, there was a beach where there's a big cliff full of fossil shells,

1138
00:44:48,840 --> 00:44:52,640
 so really old shells, and the crabs will wait at the bottom of the cliff, waiting for the

1139
00:44:52,640 --> 00:44:56,320
 fossils to drop out, and then they will use those as their home.

1140
00:44:56,320 --> 00:44:57,320
 That's so cool.

1141
00:44:57,320 --> 00:45:01,760
 That's like buying like a period property, like a listed building.

1142
00:45:01,760 --> 00:45:03,260
 They're not allowed to decorate though.

1143
00:45:03,260 --> 00:45:04,260
 No, no, no.

1144
00:45:04,260 --> 00:45:05,260
 That's amazing.

1145
00:45:05,260 --> 00:45:08,240
 So they will use all sorts of things.

1146
00:45:08,240 --> 00:45:12,280
 It's really interesting what you said about how they'll go towards the smell of a dead

1147
00:45:12,280 --> 00:45:16,200
 crab, because obviously in nature that's very unusual, isn't it?

1148
00:45:16,200 --> 00:45:20,960
 Like usually if a member of your species has died, you would usually give that a bit of

1149
00:45:20,960 --> 00:45:21,960
 a wide berth.

1150
00:45:21,960 --> 00:45:23,460
 Yeah, unless you want to eat it.

1151
00:45:23,460 --> 00:45:26,160
 Well, yeah, which is what they do, I think, as well, right?

1152
00:45:26,160 --> 00:45:27,160
 They might do.

1153
00:45:27,160 --> 00:45:28,160
 But yeah, you're right.

1154
00:45:28,160 --> 00:45:29,160
 It's not a good smell.

1155
00:45:29,160 --> 00:45:30,680
 Like carrion, rotting carrion is not.

1156
00:45:30,680 --> 00:45:35,240
 So what happens is that sometimes they'll climb into a bottle, and because the bottle's

1157
00:45:35,240 --> 00:45:36,680
 smooth, they can't get out.

1158
00:45:36,680 --> 00:45:37,920
 So they'll die.

1159
00:45:37,920 --> 00:45:42,480
 And then the smell of the dead crab comes out, and then the next crab goes, oh, great.

1160
00:45:42,480 --> 00:45:44,760
 Dead crab goes into the bottle, and then they get stuck.

1161
00:45:44,760 --> 00:45:46,040
 Oh, no, it's like a horror film.

1162
00:45:46,040 --> 00:45:49,440
 And then the next crab goes to find that dead crab, and then you've got a bottle full of

1163
00:45:49,440 --> 00:45:50,440
 dead crabs.

1164
00:45:50,440 --> 00:45:51,440
 Oh, God.

1165
00:45:51,440 --> 00:45:55,680
 And another kind of crazy thing about this is that maybe it's actually kind of makes

1166
00:45:55,680 --> 00:45:59,680
 sense from the crab's point of view, because if there's a ton of plastic around and you

1167
00:45:59,680 --> 00:46:03,160
 want to hide, then you hide inside the plastic.

1168
00:46:03,160 --> 00:46:08,200
 And then predators might also not really have figured out that there might be crabs inside

1169
00:46:08,200 --> 00:46:09,200
 of yoghurt pots.

1170
00:46:09,200 --> 00:46:12,200
 And so they haven't kind of learned yet to go looking.

1171
00:46:12,200 --> 00:46:15,880
 So it could be actually an advantage for the crabs.

1172
00:46:15,880 --> 00:46:16,880
 And they're also lighter.

1173
00:46:16,880 --> 00:46:17,880
 Yeah.

1174
00:46:17,880 --> 00:46:18,880
 As a shell.

1175
00:46:18,880 --> 00:46:19,880
 Yeah, they're all pretty flue.

1176
00:46:19,880 --> 00:46:20,880
 They take almost no energy to pick up.

1177
00:46:20,880 --> 00:46:21,880
 They're all really clever.

1178
00:46:21,880 --> 00:46:24,200
 They sort of, the way they do it.

1179
00:46:24,200 --> 00:46:27,000
 So they sometimes evict each other.

1180
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:31,760
 So if you have outgrown your shell and you spotted a hermit crab with a shell that would

1181
00:46:31,760 --> 00:46:36,480
 be perfect for your current size, they go over and bang on the shell with their claws.

1182
00:46:36,480 --> 00:46:37,480
 They do.

1183
00:46:37,480 --> 00:46:39,440
 And before the fight breaks out, they'll show each other their claws.

1184
00:46:39,440 --> 00:46:42,040
 Because if you've got the bigger claws, then generally you're the one who wins.

1185
00:46:42,040 --> 00:46:43,560
 So they try not to have a fight.

1186
00:46:43,560 --> 00:46:47,640
 They'll be like, look, I'm this big, and the other one will, they'll compare claw size.

1187
00:46:47,640 --> 00:46:49,640
 And that can deflect fights.

1188
00:46:49,640 --> 00:46:50,640
 That would be good.

1189
00:46:50,640 --> 00:46:54,080
 You know, in boxing at the start, before the boxing fight, they always come up to each

1190
00:46:54,080 --> 00:46:58,000
 other and sort of like stand head to head and sort of talk to each other.

1191
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:01,120
 It would be good if every time one of them just went, oh, no, I'm going to lose this.

1192
00:47:01,120 --> 00:47:03,760
 You're way bigger than me.

1193
00:47:03,760 --> 00:47:05,040
 Is that the weigh-in, James?

1194
00:47:05,040 --> 00:47:06,040
 Yeah, yeah.

1195
00:47:06,040 --> 00:47:07,040
 Are they actually weighed at that point?

1196
00:47:07,040 --> 00:47:08,040
 Yes, they are.

1197
00:47:08,040 --> 00:47:11,120
 Because in most weights, there's a maximum weight you can be, and they try and get as

1198
00:47:11,120 --> 00:47:12,120
 close to that as possible.

1199
00:47:12,120 --> 00:47:14,600
 And are they both, I've always wondered this about boxing, are they both standing on the

1200
00:47:14,600 --> 00:47:15,600
 same set of scales?

1201
00:47:15,600 --> 00:47:17,960
 Because they're standing right facing each other and looking at each other.

1202
00:47:17,960 --> 00:47:20,480
 I always wonder if there's one big set of scales in the middle that they both have to

1203
00:47:20,480 --> 00:47:21,480
 get on.

1204
00:47:21,480 --> 00:47:25,700
 As in, like one of those balance scales that goes up and down, and now it's one set of

1205
00:47:25,700 --> 00:47:26,700
 scales and they take turns.

1206
00:47:26,700 --> 00:47:27,700
 Oh, they do?

1207
00:47:27,700 --> 00:47:28,700
 Okay.

1208
00:47:28,700 --> 00:47:29,700
 You've got to use the same set.

1209
00:47:29,700 --> 00:47:30,700
 Oh, sure.

1210
00:47:30,700 --> 00:47:31,700
 Yeah, yeah.

1211
00:47:31,700 --> 00:47:34,080
 But it would be nice if there was a joint set, and they could both use it at the same time.

1212
00:47:34,080 --> 00:47:35,320
 And if it goes over the weight.

1213
00:47:35,320 --> 00:47:36,320
 Just a seesaw.

1214
00:47:36,320 --> 00:47:37,320
 Exactly.

1215
00:47:37,320 --> 00:47:38,320
 And it has to be exactly balanced.

1216
00:47:38,320 --> 00:47:39,320
 Yeah.

1217
00:47:39,320 --> 00:47:40,320
 And it would be nice, actually it would be nicer if in the middle of the boxing ring

1218
00:47:40,320 --> 00:47:41,320
 was a seesaw.

1219
00:47:41,320 --> 00:47:42,320
 And whoever wins the seesaw.

1220
00:47:42,320 --> 00:47:43,320
 How do you win at seesaw?

1221
00:47:43,320 --> 00:47:44,320
 Do not win.

1222
00:47:44,320 --> 00:47:45,320
 Yeah.

1223
00:47:45,320 --> 00:47:46,320
 That was a very competitive trial.

1224
00:47:46,320 --> 00:47:47,320
 Absolutely.

1225
00:47:47,320 --> 00:47:52,320
 Crush them on the little springy dogs at the park today.

1226
00:47:52,320 --> 00:47:56,020
 Hermit crabs, hermit crabs.

1227
00:47:56,020 --> 00:47:57,020
 Hermit crabs.

1228
00:47:57,020 --> 00:48:00,340
 So they do actually decorate their homes quite well.

1229
00:48:00,340 --> 00:48:04,060
 And so we've talked about the way they move house, but when they're living in their house,

1230
00:48:04,060 --> 00:48:05,060
 they do various things.

1231
00:48:05,060 --> 00:48:09,580
 The anemone hermit crab gets anemones and sticks them to its shell.

1232
00:48:09,580 --> 00:48:13,380
 And I think it's because they've got stinging tentacles that affect other passers by.

1233
00:48:13,380 --> 00:48:14,540
 And so it's a little bit of protection.

1234
00:48:14,540 --> 00:48:19,580
 The anemone gets some food, but when they move shells, they do then take all the furniture

1235
00:48:19,580 --> 00:48:20,580
 with them.

1236
00:48:20,580 --> 00:48:21,580
 The flat doesn't come furnished.

1237
00:48:21,580 --> 00:48:22,760
 So I think they spend ages.

1238
00:48:22,760 --> 00:48:23,760
 Is this right?

1239
00:48:23,760 --> 00:48:24,760
 They spent ages prizing off the anemones.

1240
00:48:24,760 --> 00:48:25,760
 Yeah.

1241
00:48:25,760 --> 00:48:26,760
 Yeah.

1242
00:48:26,760 --> 00:48:30,400
 There's a species of deep sea anemone that was discovered just last year.

1243
00:48:30,400 --> 00:48:32,960
 And they got a couple into the aquarium.

1244
00:48:32,960 --> 00:48:35,040
 And this was a scientist in Japan.

1245
00:48:35,040 --> 00:48:37,160
 And it spent two days trying to move the anemone.

1246
00:48:37,160 --> 00:48:38,160
 Wow.

1247
00:48:38,160 --> 00:48:39,160
 Yeah.

1248
00:48:39,160 --> 00:48:41,720
 It was like pinching it and pulling it and like just generally trying to get it to let

1249
00:48:41,720 --> 00:48:42,720
 go.

1250
00:48:42,720 --> 00:48:46,040
 And then you've got to persuade it to cling on to the new one as well.

1251
00:48:46,040 --> 00:48:47,040
 Oh my God.

1252
00:48:47,040 --> 00:48:48,040
 It just doesn't want to move.

1253
00:48:48,040 --> 00:48:49,040
 Yeah.

1254
00:48:49,040 --> 00:48:50,040
 The anemone, I don't know if it knows.

1255
00:48:50,040 --> 00:48:51,660
 But basically just, I don't know.

1256
00:48:51,660 --> 00:48:52,660
 But it's just not cooperating.

1257
00:48:52,660 --> 00:48:53,660
 It just clings on, right?

1258
00:48:53,660 --> 00:48:54,660
 It just clings on.

1259
00:48:54,660 --> 00:48:59,780
 But the crab is like, well, they might not get another anemone and they're in short supply.

1260
00:48:59,780 --> 00:49:01,060
 So you have to bring them with you.

1261
00:49:01,060 --> 00:49:02,060
 Wow.

1262
00:49:02,060 --> 00:49:03,060
 So great.

1263
00:49:03,060 --> 00:49:04,060
 Yeah.

1264
00:49:04,060 --> 00:49:05,060
 That's really amazing.

1265
00:49:05,060 --> 00:49:06,060
 It's like the worst blue tack ever when you're moving out of a house.

1266
00:49:06,060 --> 00:49:07,060
 It's scraping away.

1267
00:49:07,060 --> 00:49:08,060
 Two days.

1268
00:49:08,060 --> 00:49:09,060
 Yeah.

1269
00:49:09,060 --> 00:49:10,060
 Why don't I put that poster up?

1270
00:49:10,060 --> 00:49:11,940
 Have you heard of Aki Inomata?

1271
00:49:11,940 --> 00:49:12,940
 She's a Japanese artist.

1272
00:49:12,940 --> 00:49:13,940
 No.

1273
00:49:13,940 --> 00:49:14,940
 I don't think so.

1274
00:49:14,940 --> 00:49:20,800
 She does collaborations with animals and one of the animals that she's done an art project

1275
00:49:20,800 --> 00:49:22,900
 with is a hermit crab.

1276
00:49:22,900 --> 00:49:23,900
 Okay.

1277
00:49:23,900 --> 00:49:27,900
 So she's 3D printed miniature cities.

1278
00:49:27,900 --> 00:49:28,900
 Oh yeah.

1279
00:49:28,900 --> 00:49:29,900
 Hi CDs.

1280
00:49:29,900 --> 00:49:35,760
 And she puts the miniature city sort of model she's built on top of a shell and then lets

1281
00:49:35,760 --> 00:49:37,320
 her hermit crab move into that.

1282
00:49:37,320 --> 00:49:38,320
 It is cool.

1283
00:49:38,320 --> 00:49:41,160
 I mean, I guess it's also not a natural shell, which would be the best thing.

1284
00:49:41,160 --> 00:49:43,220
 But it's an interesting, you know.

1285
00:49:43,220 --> 00:49:44,220
 They won't move into anything.

1286
00:49:44,220 --> 00:49:48,620
 Like you give them like make them little Lego homes, they'll move it, they'll try that.

1287
00:49:48,620 --> 00:49:51,900
 And I looked a bit more into her work Inomata.

1288
00:49:51,900 --> 00:49:55,880
 She's done another project, which is called I wear the dog's hair and the dog wears my

1289
00:49:55,880 --> 00:49:56,880
 hair.

1290
00:49:56,880 --> 00:49:57,880
 Okay.

1291
00:49:57,880 --> 00:50:00,880
 And she and her dog wore capes made from each other's hair.

1292
00:50:00,880 --> 00:50:01,880
 Okay.

1293
00:50:01,880 --> 00:50:03,700
 And it looks a lot nicer than you would think it would look.

1294
00:50:03,700 --> 00:50:04,700
 When you say collaboration.

1295
00:50:04,700 --> 00:50:07,700
 It was the dog's idea.

1296
00:50:07,700 --> 00:50:14,140
 She said, I collected the hair of a dog called Ciello and my own hair over a number of years

1297
00:50:14,140 --> 00:50:17,300
 and then make clothes out of my hair for the dog and the dog's hair for myself so we can

1298
00:50:17,300 --> 00:50:18,300
 exchange coats.

1299
00:50:18,300 --> 00:50:21,700
 The two species, human beings and dogs have developed together over the ages.

1300
00:50:21,700 --> 00:50:24,720
 This work examines the relationship between a human and her pet.

1301
00:50:24,720 --> 00:50:25,720
 Okay.

1302
00:50:25,720 --> 00:50:26,720
 What kind of dog was it?

1303
00:50:26,720 --> 00:50:28,320
 I just want to know what kind of patterning it had.

1304
00:50:28,320 --> 00:50:29,320
 Small dog.

1305
00:50:29,320 --> 00:50:30,320
 Oh, wow.

1306
00:50:30,320 --> 00:50:31,320
 Was it spotty or stropey or?

1307
00:50:31,320 --> 00:50:32,320
 Just brown, I think.

1308
00:50:32,320 --> 00:50:34,340
 I'm just wondering if it's a small dog.

1309
00:50:34,340 --> 00:50:36,140
 What kind of outfit you can make really?

1310
00:50:36,140 --> 00:50:37,840
 It's wearing quite a natty little waistcoat.

1311
00:50:37,840 --> 00:50:38,840
 It looks good.

1312
00:50:38,840 --> 00:50:39,840
 Nice.

1313
00:50:39,840 --> 00:50:42,880
 And she's wearing a kind of cool sleeveless jacket thing.

1314
00:50:42,880 --> 00:50:45,420
 So the dog's waistcoat is made out of her hair.

1315
00:50:45,420 --> 00:50:46,420
 That's right.

1316
00:50:46,420 --> 00:50:48,460
 So why don't we make more clothes out of human hair?

1317
00:50:48,460 --> 00:50:49,460
 Yeah, Andy.

1318
00:50:49,460 --> 00:50:50,460
 That's a good question.

1319
00:50:50,460 --> 00:50:51,460
 Oh, I don't know.

1320
00:50:51,460 --> 00:50:52,460
 Let's do it.

1321
00:50:52,460 --> 00:50:53,460
 Well, one creepy, I would say.

1322
00:50:53,460 --> 00:50:54,460
 Yeah.

1323
00:50:54,460 --> 00:50:57,740
 But I mean, you get a lot of, I mean, I guess they use, like, when you get your haircut,

1324
00:50:57,740 --> 00:51:01,300
 like, if it's good hair, they'll use it for making wigs and that's a good wigs.

1325
00:51:01,300 --> 00:51:02,300
 That's good.

1326
00:51:02,300 --> 00:51:03,300
 Well, that's true.

1327
00:51:03,300 --> 00:51:04,300
 Maybe we do that instead.

1328
00:51:04,300 --> 00:51:05,300
 I don't know.

1329
00:51:05,300 --> 00:51:06,300
 I just wondered.

1330
00:51:06,300 --> 00:51:07,300
 Probably.

1331
00:51:07,300 --> 00:51:08,300
 I mean, this woman's a very good artist, it sounds like.

1332
00:51:08,300 --> 00:51:11,020
 And probably most people who try to make clothes out of human hair would look like shit.

1333
00:51:11,020 --> 00:51:12,020
 Yeah.

1334
00:51:12,020 --> 00:51:18,020
 But if you think of all the head and shoulders you have to put in the washing machine, do

1335
00:51:18,020 --> 00:51:22,420
 you guys know about, I really love historical manias, and I think we often cover them on

1336
00:51:22,420 --> 00:51:23,420
 the show.

1337
00:51:23,420 --> 00:51:27,660
 And I don't think we've talked about conchillomania or conchillomania.

1338
00:51:27,660 --> 00:51:31,700
 In the 18th century, people just got really obsessed with collecting shells, didn't they?

1339
00:51:31,700 --> 00:51:32,700
 I really did.

1340
00:51:32,700 --> 00:51:36,020
 And it sounds like a really fun time to be alive and the.

1341
00:51:36,020 --> 00:51:40,180
 Ponds, you'll die at 40.

1342
00:51:40,180 --> 00:51:41,180
 Pros.

1343
00:51:41,180 --> 00:51:43,580
 Lovely shell collections of conchillomania.

1344
00:51:43,580 --> 00:51:44,580
 Yeah.

1345
00:51:44,580 --> 00:51:45,580
 Worth it.

1346
00:51:45,580 --> 00:51:49,740
 So, I suppose, like, a lot of these manias, it's a time when people in the Western world

1347
00:51:49,740 --> 00:51:53,020
 or in Europe are exploring more, so they're finding more exciting shells around the world.

1348
00:51:53,020 --> 00:51:55,500
 The most valued was this one called Glory of the Sea.

1349
00:51:55,500 --> 00:51:57,220
 Have you seen a Glory of the Sea show?

1350
00:51:57,220 --> 00:51:58,220
 I have.

1351
00:51:58,220 --> 00:51:59,220
 Yes.

1352
00:51:59,220 --> 00:52:00,220
 They're not that impressive, are they?

1353
00:52:00,220 --> 00:52:01,220
 Well, no, you're right.

1354
00:52:01,220 --> 00:52:04,540
 I've seen one that was like, was from that time, and it was collected by Victoria Collectors

1355
00:52:04,540 --> 00:52:05,540
 in the Natural History Museum.

1356
00:52:05,540 --> 00:52:06,540
 Oh, cool.

1357
00:52:06,540 --> 00:52:07,540
 Come back.

1358
00:52:07,540 --> 00:52:13,220
 But, yeah, it's because no one had one, and so, therefore, you know, the few that existed.

1359
00:52:13,220 --> 00:52:17,180
 Is that the one where there's a story about someone buying another one?

1360
00:52:17,180 --> 00:52:22,700
 He had one already, bought another one at auction, and then immediately smashed it to pieces.

1361
00:52:22,700 --> 00:52:24,420
 In order to up the value of the first one.

1362
00:52:24,420 --> 00:52:25,420
 Yeah, I've heard that story.

1363
00:52:25,420 --> 00:52:26,420
 And that might just be aproposal.

1364
00:52:26,420 --> 00:52:28,420
 I don't know if it's true, but it's that kind of level of me.

1365
00:52:28,420 --> 00:52:29,420
 It was that vibe.

1366
00:52:29,420 --> 00:52:30,420
 Yeah, yeah.

1367
00:52:30,420 --> 00:52:34,580
 There's definitely one that's sold for three times more than a Vermeer painting at the

1368
00:52:34,580 --> 00:52:36,380
 same auction.

1369
00:52:36,380 --> 00:52:40,740
 And then there was this awful moment where we slightly got over the shell collecting

1370
00:52:40,740 --> 00:52:43,740
 obsession by the 20th century, but they were still really valuable.

1371
00:52:43,740 --> 00:52:50,220
 And I think in 1966, there were only 41 known specimens in the world.

1372
00:52:50,220 --> 00:52:56,380
 And then in 1969, we just found this habitat in New Guinea where they all live, and now

1373
00:52:56,380 --> 00:52:57,380
 there are tons of them.

1374
00:52:57,380 --> 00:52:58,820
 Scuba divers found them, didn't they?

1375
00:52:58,820 --> 00:52:59,820
 Yeah.

1376
00:52:59,820 --> 00:53:00,820
 I think, yeah.

1377
00:53:00,820 --> 00:53:03,500
 And there's probably not so many left for hermit crabs now.

1378
00:53:03,500 --> 00:53:04,500
 No, that's true.

1379
00:53:04,500 --> 00:53:06,980
 Actually, I don't know if they're good for hermit crabs.

1380
00:53:06,980 --> 00:53:08,540
 They've got quite small openings.

1381
00:53:08,540 --> 00:53:09,540
 They are very petite.

1382
00:53:09,540 --> 00:53:10,540
 It would have to.

1383
00:53:10,540 --> 00:53:11,940
 It was the very lower end of the housing market, I think.

1384
00:53:11,940 --> 00:53:12,940
 Yeah.

1385
00:53:12,940 --> 00:53:13,940
 That's the first time.

1386
00:53:13,940 --> 00:53:14,940
 Yeah.

1387
00:53:14,940 --> 00:53:15,940
 You've written a whole book about shells.

1388
00:53:15,940 --> 00:53:16,940
 I have.

1389
00:53:16,940 --> 00:53:17,940
 Spirals in Time.

1390
00:53:17,940 --> 00:53:18,940
 That's correct.

1391
00:53:18,940 --> 00:53:19,940
 Such a great title.

1392
00:53:19,940 --> 00:53:20,940
 Thank you.

1393
00:53:20,940 --> 00:53:21,940
 Can I ask you, Helen, about periostracum?

1394
00:53:21,940 --> 00:53:22,940
 Oh.

1395
00:53:22,940 --> 00:53:24,140
 I might be saying it wrong.

1396
00:53:24,140 --> 00:53:28,060
 I say periostracum, but you know, I'm making that up as well.

1397
00:53:28,060 --> 00:53:31,620
 You're an actual expert in this field, so I'm going to go with what you're saying.

1398
00:53:31,620 --> 00:53:33,620
 Is it true that shells, this is like a skin?

1399
00:53:33,620 --> 00:53:34,620
 Yes.

1400
00:53:34,620 --> 00:53:35,620
 Shells have skin in life.

1401
00:53:35,620 --> 00:53:36,620
 Some do.

1402
00:53:36,620 --> 00:53:37,620
 Yeah.

1403
00:53:37,620 --> 00:53:39,340
 So it's like a hairy layer that grows on the outside.

1404
00:53:39,340 --> 00:53:43,540
 I think it's like a probably camouflage, probably some sort of protective thing that

1405
00:53:43,540 --> 00:53:47,580
 makes them look less like a shell and more like a bit of weedy rock.

1406
00:53:47,580 --> 00:53:48,580
 Yeah.

1407
00:53:48,580 --> 00:53:49,580
 Yeah.

1408
00:53:49,580 --> 00:53:53,260
 All the shells that we see, well, no, like lots of them will have had skin.

1409
00:53:53,260 --> 00:53:54,260
 That's weird, isn't it?

1410
00:53:54,260 --> 00:53:55,260
 Yeah.

1411
00:53:55,260 --> 00:53:56,260
 Isn't that weird?

1412
00:53:56,260 --> 00:53:57,260
 I find it a bit weird.

1413
00:53:57,260 --> 00:53:58,260
 It's quite weird.

1414
00:53:58,260 --> 00:53:59,260
 Yeah.

1415
00:53:59,260 --> 00:54:00,260
 And then the thing is like cowries, which are really shiny.

1416
00:54:00,260 --> 00:54:02,660
 They seem like big, lovely, shiny cowrie shells.

1417
00:54:02,660 --> 00:54:05,140
 The reason they're shiny is because part of their body called the mantle, which is like

1418
00:54:05,140 --> 00:54:07,340
 the pink bit on a muscle when you eat muscles.

1419
00:54:07,340 --> 00:54:08,340
 That's the mantle.

1420
00:54:08,340 --> 00:54:11,140
 Anyway, it falls over the outside when they're alive, so they cover themselves in like a

1421
00:54:11,140 --> 00:54:15,340
 part of their body, which means they stay nice and shiny and they don't have like stuff

1422
00:54:15,340 --> 00:54:16,340
 growing on them.

1423
00:54:16,340 --> 00:54:21,140
 That's why they are so like porcelain-y kind of shiny glassy.

1424
00:54:21,140 --> 00:54:24,620
 Is it porcelain or is the Italian for cowrie shell, I think?

1425
00:54:24,620 --> 00:54:25,620
 Oh, is it?

1426
00:54:25,620 --> 00:54:26,620
 Yeah.

1427
00:54:26,620 --> 00:54:27,620
 Cool.

1428
00:54:27,620 --> 00:54:28,620
 There you go.

1429
00:54:28,620 --> 00:54:29,620
 Yeah.

1430
00:54:29,620 --> 00:54:32,460
 It was named after the cowrie shell, I think.

1431
00:54:32,460 --> 00:54:33,860
 Ooh, that's cool.

1432
00:54:33,860 --> 00:54:40,460
 And the cowrie shell was named porcelain-er because it reminded people of a pig's vagina.

1433
00:54:40,460 --> 00:54:43,860
 Yeah, cowrie's got a lot of that sort of stuff going on.

1434
00:54:43,860 --> 00:54:45,860
 You can't see that when you picture a cowrie shell.

1435
00:54:45,860 --> 00:54:46,860
 I mean, yeah.

1436
00:54:46,860 --> 00:54:47,860
 I can see it.

1437
00:54:47,860 --> 00:54:48,860
 First thing that springs to mind.

1438
00:54:48,860 --> 00:54:53,420
 If you've only ever seen a cowrie shell or a pig's vagina, basically you've seen them

1439
00:54:53,420 --> 00:54:54,420
 both.

1440
00:54:54,420 --> 00:54:55,420
 I think that's correct.

1441
00:54:55,420 --> 00:54:56,420
 Yeah, I would say.

1442
00:54:56,420 --> 00:54:57,420
 For people at home.

1443
00:54:57,420 --> 00:55:02,020
 It's true, Helen, that we don't really know how shells form when animals grow their own

1444
00:55:02,020 --> 00:55:03,020
 shells.

1445
00:55:03,020 --> 00:55:07,620
 The process of biomineralization, I mean, it's a bit of a mystery.

1446
00:55:07,620 --> 00:55:10,100
 It's still a bit of a mystery because it's one of those things that takes a very long

1447
00:55:10,100 --> 00:55:11,100
 time.

1448
00:55:11,100 --> 00:55:12,100
 I think there's a lot going on.

1449
00:55:12,100 --> 00:55:15,420
 There's like a protein scaffold that gets laid down first, I think, and then the calcium

1450
00:55:15,420 --> 00:55:18,980
 carbonate, which is the hard stuff, gets laid down in that.

1451
00:55:18,980 --> 00:55:20,780
 And it's all at the outer edge of it.

1452
00:55:20,780 --> 00:55:26,700
 They harvest the calcium ions and carbonate ions from seawater and then combine the two

1453
00:55:26,700 --> 00:55:30,300
 of them together and they make crystals of calcium carbonate, which then go on this

1454
00:55:30,300 --> 00:55:31,300
 scaffold.

1455
00:55:31,300 --> 00:55:32,300
 Right.

1456
00:55:32,300 --> 00:55:34,060
 It sounds like we do know how it's made.

1457
00:55:34,060 --> 00:55:35,060
 Yeah.

1458
00:55:35,060 --> 00:55:36,060
 Okay, but again.

1459
00:55:36,060 --> 00:55:37,060
 I mean, that's a broad brush.

1460
00:55:37,060 --> 00:55:38,060
 We know what happens.

1461
00:55:38,060 --> 00:55:39,060
 But how?

1462
00:55:39,060 --> 00:55:40,060
 And also why?

1463
00:55:40,060 --> 00:55:41,060
 Yeah, exactly.

1464
00:55:41,060 --> 00:55:42,060
 And then it can be.

1465
00:55:42,060 --> 00:55:46,060
 But I just think that's insane that they can harvest.

1466
00:55:46,060 --> 00:55:48,140
 But they don't know that they're doing it.

1467
00:55:48,140 --> 00:55:49,140
 It's not on their chemist.

1468
00:55:49,140 --> 00:55:50,140
 It doesn't make it less impressive.

1469
00:55:50,140 --> 00:55:55,140
 Well, it does make it a bit less impressive, but I do think it's just amazing.

1470
00:55:55,140 --> 00:55:56,380
 It's really cool.

1471
00:55:56,380 --> 00:56:01,100
 The world's most exclusive textile is made from a bivalve and I'd never heard of this.

1472
00:56:01,100 --> 00:56:02,780
 Have you seen this?

1473
00:56:02,780 --> 00:56:04,140
 It's made from the pen shell.

1474
00:56:04,140 --> 00:56:06,580
 So a bivalve is like a mussel, right?

1475
00:56:06,580 --> 00:56:07,580
 Or a snappy shell.

1476
00:56:07,580 --> 00:56:08,580
 Yeah, I think with two shells.

1477
00:56:08,580 --> 00:56:09,580
 A snappy shell.

1478
00:56:09,580 --> 00:56:10,580
 A pack man.

1479
00:56:10,580 --> 00:56:11,580
 A pack man.

1480
00:56:11,580 --> 00:56:12,580
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1481
00:56:12,580 --> 00:56:17,460
 There are only 60 items known to be made of this special silk from this special pen shell.

1482
00:56:17,460 --> 00:56:20,820
 And so you've seen one of these things and basically they're huge, aren't they?

1483
00:56:20,820 --> 00:56:21,820
 The shells?

1484
00:56:21,820 --> 00:56:22,820
 They're like a metre tall.

1485
00:56:22,820 --> 00:56:23,820
 Yeah, I mean, they used to be.

1486
00:56:23,820 --> 00:56:24,820
 Now they're not.

1487
00:56:24,820 --> 00:56:25,820
 They're doing quite badly now and there's not as big.

1488
00:56:25,820 --> 00:56:26,820
 Yeah, they can.

1489
00:56:26,820 --> 00:56:27,820
 It's basically like a beard.

1490
00:56:27,820 --> 00:56:32,260
 Oh, like when you have mussels, if you eat moulmagne and you pull off the mossy beardy

1491
00:56:32,260 --> 00:56:33,260
 bits, the same stuff.

1492
00:56:33,260 --> 00:56:34,260
 The threads.

1493
00:56:34,260 --> 00:56:35,260
 The threads, exactly.

1494
00:56:35,260 --> 00:56:38,860
 And then you use this hair to embed ourselves in the seed bed, right, that little root.

1495
00:56:38,860 --> 00:56:41,220
 And then you make this amazing silk out of it.

1496
00:56:41,220 --> 00:56:42,220
 Yeah, you go through it.

1497
00:56:42,220 --> 00:56:43,380
 It goes through stages of processing.

1498
00:56:43,380 --> 00:56:46,940
 I went to Sardinia, which is really where the only people left who do it.

1499
00:56:46,940 --> 00:56:47,940
 What?

1500
00:56:47,940 --> 00:56:48,940
 And I saw them going through.

1501
00:56:48,940 --> 00:56:49,940
 In fact, I think there's one woman left I read.

1502
00:56:49,940 --> 00:56:50,940
 Did you meet one?

1503
00:56:50,940 --> 00:56:51,940
 Yeah.

1504
00:56:51,940 --> 00:56:52,940
 I met that one woman.

1505
00:56:52,940 --> 00:56:53,940
 Oh.

1506
00:56:53,940 --> 00:56:54,940
 Chiara Vigo.

1507
00:56:54,940 --> 00:56:57,220
 I don't know if I should be mean.

1508
00:56:57,220 --> 00:57:02,420
 No, I'm not going to be mean, but she claims to be the last living mistress of sea silk,

1509
00:57:02,420 --> 00:57:03,580
 as it's called.

1510
00:57:03,580 --> 00:57:06,420
 But I met several other people who do it.

1511
00:57:06,420 --> 00:57:09,440
 And this is explosive news to me and probably no one else.

1512
00:57:09,440 --> 00:57:12,540
 No, and it's all in the book.

1513
00:57:12,540 --> 00:57:13,540
 It's inspires and time.

1514
00:57:13,540 --> 00:57:14,540
 I talk about it.

1515
00:57:14,540 --> 00:57:19,140
 I met her and she's kind of all like very woo-woo about it and she can go into her little

1516
00:57:19,140 --> 00:57:22,700
 workshop and she does all this kind of, oh, and here it is, and I do all these things.

1517
00:57:22,700 --> 00:57:27,180
 But then, yeah, I met two other women who've learned it from there because it's handed.

1518
00:57:27,180 --> 00:57:30,020
 No one does it because you're not allowed to harvest these things anymore, but from

1519
00:57:30,020 --> 00:57:34,100
 the fact they're not doing very well because they've just been wiped out by disease, pen

1520
00:57:34,100 --> 00:57:37,420
 shells are now protected, so you can't go and take one to get there.

1521
00:57:37,420 --> 00:57:39,140
 So did you call the police on this one?

1522
00:57:39,140 --> 00:57:43,500
 Well, no, because she claims that she can sustainably harvest them, but no one's allowed

1523
00:57:43,500 --> 00:57:44,500
 to watch her do it.

1524
00:57:44,500 --> 00:57:45,740
 That was the part where I was like, oh, okay.

1525
00:57:45,740 --> 00:57:48,500
 Yes, because she says she doesn't harm the shell, no she doesn't harm you.

1526
00:57:48,500 --> 00:57:52,180
 She's like, no, no, they're fine, they grow back and I'm like, they do grow back, but

1527
00:57:52,180 --> 00:57:56,020
 I don't know how fast and if it's fast enough and she doesn't let anyone watch her while

1528
00:57:56,020 --> 00:57:57,020
 she's doing it.

1529
00:57:57,020 --> 00:57:58,020
 Oh, interesting.

1530
00:57:58,020 --> 00:58:03,180
 I will keep the pig alive while I make this bacon sandwich, but I must do it in a closed

1531
00:58:03,180 --> 00:58:04,180
 room and you can't come in.

1532
00:58:04,180 --> 00:58:05,780
 You might hear some squealing, that's me.

1533
00:58:05,780 --> 00:58:15,660
 I just love bacon so much.

1534
00:58:15,660 --> 00:58:16,660
 Okay, that's it.

1535
00:58:16,660 --> 00:58:17,660
 That's all of our facts.

00:58:17,660 --> 00:58:20,220

1551

1552
00:59:04,420 --> 00:59:08,380
 Way more important than that is please, buy all of Helen's books.

1553
00:59:08,380 --> 00:59:12,860
 They're amazing, but definitely buy the latest book, which is...

1554
00:59:12,860 --> 00:59:14,940
 What the Wild Sea can be.

1555
00:59:14,940 --> 00:59:17,860
 It's such a romantic title, I love it.

1556
00:59:17,860 --> 00:59:18,860
 Do you like it?

1557
00:59:18,860 --> 00:59:19,860
 I came up with it first.

1558
00:59:19,860 --> 00:59:21,340
 Normally the title comes last.

1559
00:59:21,340 --> 00:59:23,660
 Sparrow's in Time was particularly painful.

1560
00:59:23,660 --> 00:59:24,660
 That was last minute.

1561
00:59:24,660 --> 00:59:25,660
 But this one I came up first.

1562
00:59:25,660 --> 00:59:26,660
 Yeah.

1563
00:59:26,660 --> 00:59:27,660
 All the Wild Sea can be.

1564
00:59:27,660 --> 00:59:28,660
 But it has optimism in it, doesn't it?

1565
00:59:28,660 --> 00:59:29,660
 Oh, definitely.

1566
00:59:29,660 --> 00:59:30,660
 Yeah, that's kind of the point.

1567
00:59:30,660 --> 00:59:33,540
 It's like let's not give up and there's lots of things that's hopeful and hopefully there's

1568
00:59:33,540 --> 00:59:34,740
 some fun things in there too.

1569
00:59:34,740 --> 00:59:38,420
 So do that and come back again next week to catch us again.

1570
00:59:38,420 --> 00:59:39,420
 We will see you then.

1571
00:59:39,420 --> 00:59:40,420
 Goodbye.

1572
00:59:40,420 --> 00:59:47,740
 I've never heard of that, I've got to look it up when I go.

1573
00:59:47,740 --> 00:59:48,740
 It's fucking good.

1574
00:59:48,740 --> 00:59:52,060
 It genuinely works.

1575
00:59:52,060 --> 00:59:53,060
 What temperature?

1576
00:59:53,060 --> 00:59:54,060
 Because that's the other thing.

1577
00:59:54,060 --> 00:59:55,060
 Oh yeah, 150 Celsius.

1578
00:59:55,060 --> 00:59:56,060
 Okay.

1579
00:59:56,060 --> 00:59:57,060
 For three hours.

1580
00:59:57,060 --> 00:59:58,060
 No, fine, fine.

1581
00:59:58,060 --> 00:59:59,060
 Good, good, good.

1582
00:59:59,060 --> 01:00:00,060
