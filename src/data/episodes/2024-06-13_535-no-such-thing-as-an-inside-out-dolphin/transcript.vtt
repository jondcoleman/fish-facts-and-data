00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.920
 Hi everyone, welcome to this week's episode of No Such Thing as a Fish, where we were

00:00:05.920 --> 00:00:11.400
 joined by a special guest and that was Helen Scales.

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:17.120
 Now if you don't know Helen, she is a marine biologist, a writer, a broadcaster.

00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:18.900
 We've known her for many, many years.

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:22.840
 She's so funny, so interesting, she loves her subject so much.

00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:25.040
 Her books are absolutely great.

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:27.880
 The first one that she wrote was called Spirals in Time.

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:32.500
 I think that was the first one, which was all about shells and the history of shells.

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:37.520
 And her most recent one is called What the Wild Sea Can Be.

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:42.780
 And it is basically a look at the future of the oceans, which you might think is quite

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:45.680
 negative because of all the news stories that are going around.

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:50.640
 But Helen, as is her want, is very positive about what the future might be and how we

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:52.640
 can save the world.

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:57.200
 If you'd like to get her books, obviously they're available from all the usual places.

00:00:57.200 --> 00:01:02.800
 But if you go to helenscales.com, you can visit her shop, which is related to the online

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:04.360
 bookseller's bookshop.

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:09.560
 And if you go there, then all her commissions will go to the charity Sea Changers.

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:13.400
 So you'll help save the sea as well as learning about the sea.

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:17.000
 There's also details on her website about a couple of shows she's doing to promote the

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.680
 book, so make sure you have a look at that if you like what you hear in this episode.

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:22.640
 And I know that you will.

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:25.440
 One more thing to say, you know we have a tour coming up.

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:31.920
 There are still tickets for most of the UK dates and a couple of the Australia dates

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:32.920
 left for that.

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:40.120
 So do get your tickets ASAP and the people of Sydney and London do go back to know such

00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:45.960
 things as fish.com/live because there are details of new dates on there.

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:50.000
 So if you missed out on tickets to Sydney or London, then fear not because we have put

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:51.360
 some more dates on.

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:52.520
 Okay, that's it.

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:53.920
 That's all I have to say this week.

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:58.120
 So really all there is left to say is on with the podcast.

00:01:58.120 --> 00:01:59.120
 So let's say it.

00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:18.080
 On with the podcast.

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:23.480
 Hello and welcome to another episode of No Such Thing as a Fish, a weekly podcast coming

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:26.140
 to you from the QI offices in Hoburn.

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:30.520
 My name is Anna Tyshinski and I'm sitting here with Andrew Hunter Murray, James Harkin

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:34.720
 and extra special guest today, Helen Scales.

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:38.240
 And we have gathered round on microphones with our four favourite facts from the last

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:39.400
 seven days.

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:45.080
 So in no particular order here we go.

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:47.080
 Starting with Helen.

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:50.200
 My fact is you can play peek-a-boo with an octopus.

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:51.200
 Wow.

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:54.080
 That sounds like fun.

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:56.280
 I think it was peek-a-boo.

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:57.280
 That's what I was doing.

00:02:57.280 --> 00:02:58.280
 Because you've done this.

00:02:58.280 --> 00:02:59.280
 Yeah.

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:00.280
 Yeah.

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:01.280
 That's a personal fact.

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:02.280
 Exactly.

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:03.280
 How did peek-a-boo work?

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:04.280
 Because the game is quite rules-wise.

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:05.280
 I think so.

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:06.280
 Yeah.

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:07.280
 Maybe it was hide and seek.

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:08.400
 No, I think it was peek-a-boo.

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:14.240
 So basically I was coming back from a freedive or a snorkel if I want to make it sound not

00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:16.960
 as cool, but I'll say freedive because that does sound cooler.

00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:20.920
 And I was literally just a couple of feet from the beach and the water was like knee-high

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:24.200
 and I looked down, I was floating and I looked down and there was an octopus behind a rock

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:29.080
 and I was like, awesome because I love octopuses and I see them occasionally, but it's definitely

00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:30.520
 a special thing to see.

00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:31.520
 Where were you in the world?

00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:32.520
 Oh, sorry.

00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:33.920
 I was in Brittany in France.

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:34.920
 Very nice.

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:35.920
 Yeah.

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:38.920
 So there was this octopus and I was like, awesome, okay, fantastic.

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:45.080
 And then generally when I see exciting animals like that you have to be like just looking

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:48.880
 as much as possible because any second now it's going to just fuck off, right?

00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:51.520
 And you're left with like, oh, that was a lovely encounter, but it lasted like seconds.

00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:56.160
 But this one didn't move and I was just hanging out with it and how big are we talking?

00:03:56.160 --> 00:04:01.840
 I mean, in my mind it was like maybe a small melon sized, I think, kind of thing.

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:02.840
 Okay.

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:06.040
 So first off, I did the My Octopus Teacher Touching thing.

00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:07.040
 Have you seen My Octopus?

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:08.040
 No.

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:09.040
 No, not really.

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:13.120
 There's a bit basically where if you put your hand out, an octopus will reach out and touch

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:14.120
 you with its arms.

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:16.080
 Oh, so it's like God and Adam in the Michelangelo.

00:04:16.080 --> 00:04:17.080
 Exactly, exactly.

00:04:17.080 --> 00:04:18.080
 But God is an octopus.

00:04:18.080 --> 00:04:19.080
 And they do do that.

00:04:19.080 --> 00:04:22.000
 They basically, they're tasting you to see what you are because their suckers are really

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:24.720
 sensitive and they can have you like taste the chemicals and stuff.

00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:27.800
 So I put my hand out and it did, it's like put its little arm out and it's tiny and thin

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:32.080
 at the end and it was like, yeah, but it touched me and I was like, oh, that was amazing.

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:36.080
 And then so we did that and I was like, okay, so what else can I do with this octopus, you

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:37.080
 know, while it's got my-

00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:38.080
 Let's pick it up a notch.

00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:42.480
 So I was like, well, what if I just hide it from it?

00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:44.820
 Maybe you'll try and come and find me.

00:04:44.820 --> 00:04:45.820
 Wow.

00:04:45.820 --> 00:04:47.560
 And so I moved out of its line of sight.

00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:49.040
 So that it couldn't see me.

00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:51.040
 And it was just, it just like peered around the rock.

00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:53.040
 You know, it was definitely like, where have you gone?

00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:54.040
 You're over there.

00:04:54.040 --> 00:04:56.760
 And I'm like, no, you go.

00:04:56.760 --> 00:05:01.680
 But I just really had this sense of something a bit more intelligent and it's thinking about

00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:03.240
 you and it's interacting with you.

00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:05.480
 And it was just really, a really cool moment.

00:05:05.480 --> 00:05:08.160
 So it didn't then hide from you or anything like that?

00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:09.520
 No, it didn't hide from me.

00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:12.680
 Then I think at that point I was like, I'm getting really cold and I need to get out.

00:05:12.680 --> 00:05:15.520
 Can you do something a bit more interesting than just sit there?

00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:17.400
 And so I think I was like, I'm going to get a bit closer.

00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:21.360
 And at that point it was like, and it went off and changed it.

00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:25.280
 You know, you hear about how octopuses change color and texture and stuff, and it really

00:05:25.280 --> 00:05:26.280
 did.

00:05:26.280 --> 00:05:27.760
 It had been like pale and smooth.

00:05:27.760 --> 00:05:30.960
 And then instantly it turned like really angry red and very bumpy.

00:05:30.960 --> 00:05:31.960
 And I was like, oh, wow.

00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:32.960
 Sorry.

00:05:32.960 --> 00:05:33.960
 Are the bumps real?

00:05:33.960 --> 00:05:34.960
 Yeah.

00:05:34.960 --> 00:05:35.960
 Yeah.

00:05:35.960 --> 00:05:36.960
 So there's skin.

00:05:36.960 --> 00:05:37.960
 It's not just that it looks.

00:05:37.960 --> 00:05:38.960
 Yeah.

00:05:38.960 --> 00:05:39.960
 Yeah.

00:05:39.960 --> 00:05:40.960
 So there's skin is like loads of little muscles and they can pull up and make little like warts

00:05:40.960 --> 00:05:43.840
 and little bumps and then they can flat themselves out and change the color is also

00:05:43.840 --> 00:05:44.840
 the muscles too.

00:05:44.840 --> 00:05:48.200
 They have these like bubbles of pigment which can open and close and they can change their

00:05:48.200 --> 00:05:49.200
 color.

00:05:49.200 --> 00:05:50.200
 It's like pixels basically.

00:05:50.200 --> 00:05:51.200
 I knew that's how they show their color.

00:05:51.200 --> 00:05:55.200
 I just sort of assume that they, I didn't assume anything, I just thought I did it.

00:05:55.200 --> 00:05:56.200
 They didn't really think about it, did they?

00:05:56.200 --> 00:05:57.200
 No.

00:05:57.200 --> 00:05:58.200
 No.

00:05:58.200 --> 00:05:59.200
 Because he wouldn't really.

00:05:59.200 --> 00:06:00.200
 They're just like the way that you blush maybe.

00:06:00.200 --> 00:06:01.200
 They might just change color.

00:06:01.200 --> 00:06:02.200
 Yeah.

00:06:02.200 --> 00:06:03.200
 They have layers in their skin.

00:06:03.200 --> 00:06:04.200
 We can't blush lots of colors.

00:06:04.200 --> 00:06:05.200
 No.

00:06:05.200 --> 00:06:06.200
 I find that we could blush loads of different colors.

00:06:06.200 --> 00:06:07.200
 Like I could blush blue if I was.

00:06:07.200 --> 00:06:08.200
 Exactly.

00:06:08.200 --> 00:06:09.200
 On command.

00:06:09.200 --> 00:06:10.200
 That would be like a really cool thing to do with like GM.

00:06:10.200 --> 00:06:11.200
 Right.

00:06:11.200 --> 00:06:12.200
 Just to like give ourselves chromatophores.

00:06:12.200 --> 00:06:13.200
 Yeah.

00:06:13.200 --> 00:06:14.200
 That would be good.

00:06:14.200 --> 00:06:19.800
 It'd be like it'd be easier for those, you know those parties where you have to go in

00:06:19.800 --> 00:06:21.920
 a color like if you're available you wear green.

00:06:21.920 --> 00:06:23.720
 Oh, you'll swing those parties.

00:06:23.720 --> 00:06:24.720
 Yeah.

00:06:24.720 --> 00:06:31.120
 It's not always easy to find an Amber shirt.

00:06:31.120 --> 00:06:33.920
 They definitely do seem to be animals where you can have a bit of a relationship.

00:06:33.920 --> 00:06:34.920
 I think so.

00:06:34.920 --> 00:06:35.920
 Yeah.

00:06:35.920 --> 00:06:38.040
 I mean, I'm not going to say I made friends with it, but I just felt like for a moment

00:06:38.040 --> 00:06:40.440
 we had a bit of a play and that was cool.

00:06:40.440 --> 00:06:42.840
 I mean, I haven't ever played with a crab, for instance.

00:06:42.840 --> 00:06:45.720
 That's never really worked out or a big try then.

00:06:45.720 --> 00:06:46.720
 Yeah.

00:06:46.720 --> 00:06:47.720
 The crabs just don't go for the peekaboo.

00:06:47.720 --> 00:06:48.720
 They really don't.

00:06:48.720 --> 00:06:51.040
 Well, sometimes the octopuses don't want to be friends.

00:06:51.040 --> 00:06:54.040
 Like they seem to have such personalities that they're discerning about who they like.

00:06:54.040 --> 00:06:58.680
 There was a person who worked in a New England aquarium who, one of the octopuses there just

00:06:58.680 --> 00:07:02.760
 completely took against him and used to squirt him in the room whenever he walked in, just

00:07:02.760 --> 00:07:04.080
 actually hated him.

00:07:04.080 --> 00:07:07.640
 And then I think he left and did a degree or something, left the university and he came

00:07:07.640 --> 00:07:11.360
 back and immediately the octopus was like, "Not Barry again."

00:07:11.360 --> 00:07:12.600
 And went with him again.

00:07:12.600 --> 00:07:13.600
 Yeah.

00:07:13.600 --> 00:07:14.760
 They are a bit moody like that.

00:07:14.760 --> 00:07:15.760
 Yeah.

00:07:15.760 --> 00:07:19.240
 I've heard stories about octopuses being given food they don't like and just being like this

00:07:19.240 --> 00:07:23.040
 and they hold up to the person and go like, "Uh-uh, see what I'm going to do with this?"

00:07:23.040 --> 00:07:26.440
 And they swim across to the other side of the tank and stuff it in the drain and be like,

00:07:26.440 --> 00:07:27.440
 "No."

00:07:27.440 --> 00:07:28.440
 Wow.

00:07:28.440 --> 00:07:29.440
 That's where that's going.

00:07:29.440 --> 00:07:30.440
 Like a toddler, basically.

00:07:30.440 --> 00:07:31.440
 Yeah.

00:07:31.440 --> 00:07:32.440
 I imagine there are all those sorts of studies of like intelligence that are about that kind

00:07:32.440 --> 00:07:33.440
 of level of...

00:07:33.440 --> 00:07:35.440
 I reckon although toddlers can't play hide and seek.

00:07:35.440 --> 00:07:36.440
 Can they not?

00:07:36.440 --> 00:07:37.440
 No, no, no.

00:07:37.440 --> 00:07:39.200
 They just think you're not there when you close your eyes.

00:07:39.200 --> 00:07:40.200
 Yeah, yeah.

00:07:40.200 --> 00:07:44.560
 They did a study where they gave a toddler a doll and they put a blindfold on the doll

00:07:44.560 --> 00:07:46.960
 and the toddler thought that they couldn't see it.

00:07:46.960 --> 00:07:49.400
 Wait, they thought that the doll couldn't see the toddler?

00:07:49.400 --> 00:07:50.400
 Yeah.

00:07:50.400 --> 00:07:51.400
 But the doll couldn't see the toddler either way?

00:07:51.400 --> 00:07:52.400
 No, no, no.

00:07:52.400 --> 00:07:55.000
 They thought that the toddler thought the doll had gone invisible.

00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:58.800
 The doll had gone invisible because they don't think that because I feel like I've heard that

00:07:58.800 --> 00:08:01.680
 kind of thing and obviously the study was done, but I've heard that kind of thing where like

00:08:01.680 --> 00:08:05.400
 they think if you club your eyes and you've gone, but when you do it with kids they don't

00:08:05.400 --> 00:08:06.400
 think you've just...

00:08:06.400 --> 00:08:07.400
 I literally did it yesterday and it worked.

00:08:07.400 --> 00:08:08.400
 With you?

00:08:08.400 --> 00:08:09.400
 Yeah, yeah.

00:08:09.400 --> 00:08:10.560
 So they just think that they can see your body?

00:08:10.560 --> 00:08:13.200
 I said to her, I said, "Look at me, that took a while."

00:08:13.200 --> 00:08:17.400
 She doesn't really do what I tell her, but then eventually she looked at me and I covered

00:08:17.400 --> 00:08:18.880
 my eyes and I said, "Can you see me?"

00:08:18.880 --> 00:08:19.880
 And she said, "No."

00:08:19.880 --> 00:08:23.080
 Does that mean that she thinks she can't see you though or that she thinks the thing

00:08:23.080 --> 00:08:24.600
 to say in this game is no?

00:08:24.600 --> 00:08:25.600
 Well, because...

00:08:25.600 --> 00:08:29.600
 It feels like if you vanished then children would be like, "What the hell just happened?"

00:08:29.600 --> 00:08:33.880
 But the other evidence is that if you play hide and seek with a child, if they cover their

00:08:33.880 --> 00:08:35.520
 eyes they think you can't see them.

00:08:35.520 --> 00:08:39.080
 That's why just in the middle of the room, eyes closed, I'm hiding.

00:08:39.080 --> 00:08:40.080
 That's great.

00:08:40.080 --> 00:08:41.080
 Yeah.

00:08:41.080 --> 00:08:43.640
 And the really interesting thing is it works for voices as well apparently, although I

00:08:43.640 --> 00:08:47.160
 tried this with my daughter and it didn't work, but apparently there was a study where

00:08:47.160 --> 00:08:51.160
 experimenters put their hands over their ears and said to the child, "Can you hear me?"

00:08:51.160 --> 00:08:52.880
 And the child said, "No, I can't hear you."

00:08:52.880 --> 00:08:57.880
 Now I did try this and it didn't work with my daughter, but I'm not sure if that means

00:08:57.880 --> 00:08:59.880
 she's too smart or not smart enough.

00:08:59.880 --> 00:09:04.160
 If you put on a different voice, will she think that, for example, Bruce Forsythe is

00:09:04.160 --> 00:09:05.160
 in the room.

00:09:05.160 --> 00:09:08.480
 And she's like, "Nice to see you."

00:09:08.480 --> 00:09:12.520
 "I can't see you."

00:09:12.520 --> 00:09:16.720
 Octopus is, I think, have they been re-classed in Britain in terms of their intelligence?

00:09:16.720 --> 00:09:19.840
 Because they're so, literally they're so clever that the government has now classed them along

00:09:19.840 --> 00:09:21.340
 with vertebrates.

00:09:21.340 --> 00:09:26.960
 But they're way cleverer than most, not most, lots of vertebrates and they are classed as

00:09:26.960 --> 00:09:27.960
 sentient beings.

00:09:27.960 --> 00:09:28.960
 That's right.

00:09:28.960 --> 00:09:29.960
 Yeah.

00:09:29.960 --> 00:09:30.960
 That's good news.

00:09:30.960 --> 00:09:31.960
 It is good news.

00:09:31.960 --> 00:09:34.040
 It means, well, hopefully it means now we have to be nicer to them.

00:09:34.040 --> 00:09:36.920
 Because there are all sorts of discussions about, "Oh, should we farm them?"

00:09:36.920 --> 00:09:40.720
 And it's like, "Should we farm these really intelligent, amazing, weird creatures?"

00:09:40.720 --> 00:09:44.560
 That don't like living together and they're generally cannibalistic and, you know, all

00:09:44.560 --> 00:09:45.560
 sorts of stuff like that.

00:09:45.560 --> 00:09:48.800
 You don't want to farm like where all the cows are eating each other.

00:09:48.800 --> 00:09:49.800
 Well, exactly.

00:09:49.800 --> 00:09:53.600
 You don't want there's one great big octopus left at the end and something that's no longer

00:09:53.600 --> 00:09:55.600
 going to be possible.

00:09:55.600 --> 00:09:57.120
 Chop it up and just just eat.

00:09:57.120 --> 00:10:01.040
 You might get the same number of steaks from one enormous cow that's eaten all the other

00:10:01.040 --> 00:10:02.040
 cows.

00:10:02.040 --> 00:10:03.040
 And it's easier to herd, isn't it?

00:10:03.040 --> 00:10:04.040
 If you just got one.

00:10:04.040 --> 00:10:05.040
 You're a big dog.

00:10:05.040 --> 00:10:06.040
 Yeah.

00:10:06.040 --> 00:10:07.040
 Very big dog.

00:10:07.040 --> 00:10:08.040
 It's tragic.

00:10:08.040 --> 00:10:09.760
 They can't write, but they do pretty zinc.

00:10:09.760 --> 00:10:11.260
 Oh, that is tragic.

00:10:11.260 --> 00:10:15.340
 Is that in the Alanis Morissette song?

00:10:15.340 --> 00:10:17.440
 Is it wasps or bees that can make paper?

00:10:17.440 --> 00:10:18.440
 Yeah, wasps.

00:10:18.440 --> 00:10:19.940
 Wasps can make paper.

00:10:19.940 --> 00:10:20.940
 If they could get together.

00:10:20.940 --> 00:10:21.940
 Never the twain.

00:10:21.940 --> 00:10:22.940
 Oh, that's tragic.

00:10:22.940 --> 00:10:27.360
 If you give a wasp a snorkel and imagine that you have it for two species could wreak.

00:10:27.360 --> 00:10:28.360
 What was it?

00:10:28.360 --> 00:10:29.360
 Alanis Morissette, ironic.

00:10:29.360 --> 00:10:30.360
 Yeah.

00:10:30.360 --> 00:10:31.360
 But they weren't very ironic.

00:10:31.360 --> 00:10:32.360
 No.

00:10:32.360 --> 00:10:33.360
 They weren't very ironic.

00:10:33.360 --> 00:10:34.360
 They weren't very ironic.

00:10:34.360 --> 00:10:35.360
 There was someone else.

00:10:35.360 --> 00:10:36.360
 All right.

00:10:36.360 --> 00:10:37.360
 Avril Lavigne.

00:10:37.360 --> 00:10:38.360
 No, it was.

00:10:38.360 --> 00:10:39.360
 It was.

00:10:39.360 --> 00:10:40.360
 You're thinking of skater by.

00:10:40.360 --> 00:10:41.360
 Yeah.

00:10:41.360 --> 00:10:42.360
 I could use the two the other day in the social situation.

00:10:42.360 --> 00:10:43.360
 And I haven't had the end of it yet.

00:10:43.360 --> 00:10:44.360
 Anyway.

00:10:44.360 --> 00:10:45.360
 He was a wasp.

00:10:45.360 --> 00:10:46.360
 She was an octopus.

00:10:46.360 --> 00:10:51.360
 Can I make it any more obvious?

00:10:51.360 --> 00:10:53.360
 They're very strong octopuses as well.

00:10:53.360 --> 00:10:56.080
 Every sucker is so powerful, isn't it?

00:10:56.080 --> 00:10:58.040
 And I think I worked out.

00:10:58.040 --> 00:11:02.320
 So if a sucker touches an object, it changes shape to form this seal around it.

00:11:02.320 --> 00:11:07.160
 And I realized that the common octopus, if it's hanging off the ceiling, the four of

00:11:07.160 --> 00:11:11.920
 us, and I've done some vague weight estimates, and I think it wouldn't be true if Dan was

00:11:11.920 --> 00:11:12.920
 here.

00:11:12.920 --> 00:11:21.440
 But I think the four of us, that is no heavier than I am, for sure.

00:11:21.440 --> 00:11:25.000
 But James, who does Dan have to be heavier than for this to work with the four of us,

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:26.000
 but not if Dan was here?

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:27.000
 No, I do see that.

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:28.000
 I do see it.

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:30.200
 But it did sound like a slam on Dan's head.

00:11:30.200 --> 00:11:34.800
 Look, I think we can safely say that Helen is a few inches shorter than Dan's, but they're

00:11:34.800 --> 00:11:35.800
 both in great shape.

00:11:35.800 --> 00:11:37.760
 But Dan probably weighs a few pounds more.

00:11:37.760 --> 00:11:41.520
 Once I was in the ITV studios on the South Bank, and there was a load of people in the

00:11:41.520 --> 00:11:46.440
 lift, and I walked into the lift, and it went beep, beep, beep, please leave the lift, because

00:11:46.440 --> 00:11:51.160
 I was the person who put it over the level, and I felt awful, like it was a really low

00:11:51.160 --> 00:11:52.520
 moment in my life.

00:11:52.520 --> 00:11:57.280
 But imagine that if all your mates are hanging off an octopus, and you're the one that pulls

00:11:57.280 --> 00:11:58.280
 him down.

00:11:58.280 --> 00:11:59.280
 No, that's it.

00:11:59.280 --> 00:12:00.280
 I'm letting go.

00:12:00.280 --> 00:12:04.680
 Do you know what happens if you cut the arm off an octopus?

00:12:04.680 --> 00:12:06.800
 So this is, you know, if you want to eat it.

00:12:06.800 --> 00:12:07.800
 Does it live?

00:12:07.800 --> 00:12:08.800
 Yeah.

00:12:08.800 --> 00:12:11.600
 So fishermen will chop the arms off and stick them in the bucket, and they try to climb

00:12:11.600 --> 00:12:12.600
 out, basically.

00:12:12.600 --> 00:12:17.880
 So octopus have like 500 million neurons, but half of them are in their arms.

00:12:17.880 --> 00:12:22.560
 So they have a very different kind of nerve system to us, but it's not all in their brain.

00:12:22.560 --> 00:12:25.120
 So the question is, like, do they think for themselves these arms?

00:12:25.120 --> 00:12:27.280
 So they're like actually able to make their own decisions.

00:12:27.280 --> 00:12:31.280
 But what we think they're doing is that their kind of response is to pass food towards the

00:12:31.280 --> 00:12:32.280
 mouth.

00:12:32.280 --> 00:12:34.880
 So if a bit of food goes to the end of the arm, the suckers are like passing it to the

00:12:34.880 --> 00:12:36.320
 next one and to the next one.

00:12:36.320 --> 00:12:40.800
 And actually that same motion, if you've chopped an arm off in a bucket, is climb out of the

00:12:40.800 --> 00:12:41.800
 bucket.

00:12:41.800 --> 00:12:42.800
 Do you see what I mean?

00:12:42.800 --> 00:12:43.800
 So they're just trying to pass.

00:12:43.800 --> 00:12:45.880
 They're just like, this is the thing we do.

00:12:45.880 --> 00:12:52.080
 So it's not, there's not necessarily any thought in it, but they will basically walk off.

00:12:52.080 --> 00:12:55.280
 The other thing, if you cut the very tip of an arm, it will still respond to like nasty

00:12:55.280 --> 00:12:56.280
 chemicals.

00:12:56.280 --> 00:12:59.640
 So people who are like doing science and they'll take just a little bit of tissue off and then

00:12:59.640 --> 00:13:03.520
 you try and put the little tip of the arm into a pot of alcohol and it goes, oh no, ow.

00:13:03.520 --> 00:13:06.000
 Oh, are we calling alcohol a nasty chemical?

00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:07.000
 Oh, sorry.

00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:13.200
 Well, I guess very high concentrations of alcohol used to preserve the tip of an octopus's arm.

00:13:13.200 --> 00:13:14.200
 100% scientific stuff.

00:13:14.200 --> 00:13:17.680
 Unfortunately for you, Helen, that's what Anna likes to do.

00:13:17.680 --> 00:13:18.760
 My limbs have cut off.

00:13:18.760 --> 00:13:19.760
 Go towards.

00:13:19.760 --> 00:13:25.720
 Just a thumbs up for Anna's removed and.

00:13:25.720 --> 00:13:27.200
 You don't eat octopuses, right?

00:13:27.200 --> 00:13:28.200
 No, I don't.

00:13:28.200 --> 00:13:29.200
 No.

00:13:29.200 --> 00:13:30.200
 Do you eat other fish?

00:13:30.200 --> 00:13:31.200
 Sometimes.

00:13:31.200 --> 00:13:32.200
 And not much anymore.

00:13:32.200 --> 00:13:33.360
 I did for a long time.

00:13:33.360 --> 00:13:36.880
 I gave up eating meat years and years ago and I kind of kept on eating sustainably caught

00:13:36.880 --> 00:13:38.040
 fish.

00:13:38.040 --> 00:13:40.040
 But definitely octopuses you wouldn't eat octopuses.

00:13:40.040 --> 00:13:41.040
 No, not since meeting one.

00:13:41.040 --> 00:13:42.920
 I definitely not since playing peek-a-boo with one.

00:13:42.920 --> 00:13:43.920
 I couldn't.

00:13:43.920 --> 00:13:48.120
 Something else that needs to avoid eating octopuses is the dolphin.

00:13:48.120 --> 00:13:51.640
 Although, I mean, they do like to sometimes and octopuses are really good food for other

00:13:51.640 --> 00:13:55.760
 sea animals because I guess they're very meaty, but they're quite dangerous to swallow.

00:13:55.760 --> 00:14:01.000
 And I think when dolphins do eat octopuses, they have to really work hard on cutting up

00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:03.480
 their food to tear them to shreds because they did.

00:14:03.480 --> 00:14:07.920
 I think they found a dead dolphin recently in the last couple of years, which had an

00:14:07.920 --> 00:14:12.000
 octopus in its mouth and you can see its tentacles like flopping out of its mouth.

00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:16.040
 So if I'm a dolphin and I have an octopus and it sort of clings onto the inside of

00:14:16.040 --> 00:14:20.000
 my throat as it's going down, because I haven't chewed it properly, does it pull me inside

00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:21.520
 out is what I'm trying to say?

00:14:21.520 --> 00:14:22.520
 Why?

00:14:22.520 --> 00:14:25.000
 I'll end up coming in to work the next day saying, "Oh, I think I had a doggie octopus

00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:29.040
 last night because it's attached to the inside of the tube that is me."

00:14:29.040 --> 00:14:30.040
 Yes.

00:14:30.040 --> 00:14:31.040
 Yeah, how's it done that?

00:14:31.040 --> 00:14:32.040
 And it's gone all the way through.

00:14:32.040 --> 00:14:35.200
 I don't think the dolphin was inside out when they found it and afraid that would be even

00:14:35.200 --> 00:14:40.240
 more grotesque than the already the truth, which is like you say it suckers onto their

00:14:40.240 --> 00:14:43.440
 esophagus until it chokes them to death, which is quite clever.

00:14:43.440 --> 00:14:44.440
 Yeah.

00:14:44.440 --> 00:14:45.440
 Because they'd be trained.

00:14:45.440 --> 00:14:47.360
 The CIA are always training dolphins and things, aren't they?

00:14:47.360 --> 00:14:48.360
 Good point.

00:14:48.360 --> 00:14:49.360
 Yeah.

00:14:49.360 --> 00:14:52.080
 Are you thinking, Andy, that we can defeat the CIA for whatever reason we might want

00:14:52.080 --> 00:14:56.680
 to by sending an army of octopuses to turn the dolphins inside out?

00:14:56.680 --> 00:14:57.680
 Oh, yeah.

00:14:57.680 --> 00:15:01.200
 I'll send a strong message, won't I?

00:15:01.200 --> 00:15:03.480
 Britain is back on the global stage.

00:15:03.480 --> 00:15:07.480
 We've inverted every dolphin the CIA has ever trained.

00:15:07.480 --> 00:15:15.320
 Okay, it's time for fact number two and that is my fact.

00:15:15.320 --> 00:15:20.760
 My fact this week is that during winter, the ground is too cold for male emperor penguins

00:15:20.760 --> 00:15:21.760
 feet.

00:15:21.760 --> 00:15:25.720
 So they spend two months leaning back and balancing on their heels.

00:15:25.720 --> 00:15:27.480
 That's great.

00:15:27.480 --> 00:15:30.200
 It's just so painful and uncomfortable.

00:15:30.200 --> 00:15:34.720
 They sound like kind of relaxed dads, you know, they're leaning back on their tail.

00:15:34.720 --> 00:15:39.680
 Like they lean back on the little sort of like a hunting stick, I guess.

00:15:39.680 --> 00:15:42.400
 Is that what it, you know, those shooting sticks?

00:15:42.400 --> 00:15:43.400
 Shooting sticks.

00:15:43.400 --> 00:15:44.400
 Yeah.

00:15:44.400 --> 00:15:45.840
 Oh, the lady sits on the beach.

00:15:45.840 --> 00:15:46.840
 Yeah.

00:15:46.840 --> 00:15:48.720
 So, yeah, I'm guessing you're very familiar with this and we should just say why they

00:15:48.720 --> 00:15:49.920
 have to do this.

00:15:49.920 --> 00:15:50.920
 Because it's cold.

00:15:50.920 --> 00:15:51.920
 Because it's cold.

00:15:51.920 --> 00:15:52.920
 Really cold.

00:15:52.920 --> 00:15:55.040
 Because it's really, really cold.

00:15:55.040 --> 00:15:56.040
 It's freezing.

00:15:56.040 --> 00:15:57.040
 They're in Antarctica.

00:15:57.040 --> 00:16:01.560
 It's minus 40 Celsius and the female essentially lays her egg.

00:16:01.560 --> 00:16:05.800
 I think this is right and it's in the middle of winter because they need to start incubating

00:16:05.800 --> 00:16:09.120
 the egg so that it's born in nice springtime when there's lots of food.

00:16:09.120 --> 00:16:13.560
 So middle of winter, cold as possible time, the females laid the egg, plopped it in front

00:16:13.560 --> 00:16:19.120
 of the male, disappeared for a couple of months and they have this incredible pouch that they

00:16:19.120 --> 00:16:23.040
 plop over the egg and the egg balances on his feet.

00:16:23.040 --> 00:16:26.680
 But then if his feet are flat on the ground, then they just get super, super cold.

00:16:26.680 --> 00:16:31.800
 And so, as you say, he leans back and like a tripod balances on his tail for two months.

00:16:31.800 --> 00:16:33.480
 I'd vaguely seen that they did this.

00:16:33.480 --> 00:16:36.440
 I had no idea about the details and how difficult it is.

00:16:36.440 --> 00:16:38.720
 The dads can only eat snow for those months.

00:16:38.720 --> 00:16:40.760
 They get pretty skinny, don't they, by the end?

00:16:40.760 --> 00:16:44.520
 They lose half their weight sometimes, or 40% and the dads basically had an enormous mega

00:16:44.520 --> 00:16:45.960
 barbecue the summer before.

00:16:45.960 --> 00:16:48.840
 All the dads hang out, they put on lots and lots of weight because they know they're going

00:16:48.840 --> 00:16:49.840
 to need it.

00:16:49.840 --> 00:16:50.840
 They use it all up.

00:16:50.840 --> 00:16:51.840
 Oh, that's interesting.

00:16:51.840 --> 00:16:55.480
 So when am I going to lose this weight that I thought I'm going to have to be in a dad's

00:16:55.480 --> 00:16:56.480
 sect?

00:16:56.480 --> 00:17:00.620
 You need to head on down south and spend quite a bit of time on the sea ice.

00:17:00.620 --> 00:17:02.320
 They just lose no heat.

00:17:02.320 --> 00:17:05.760
 Scientists did the sort of, you know, those heat map body things that you do, you know,

00:17:05.760 --> 00:17:07.600
 you see where someone's losing heat.

00:17:07.600 --> 00:17:12.440
 And I think they found that the only places they're losing heat are through their eyes.

00:17:12.440 --> 00:17:20.600
 You know, in Dune, the film Dune and the book Dune, they've got those still suits, which

00:17:20.600 --> 00:17:22.360
 allow them to lose zero moisture.

00:17:22.360 --> 00:17:24.360
 Yeah, they're really good.

00:17:24.360 --> 00:17:25.360
 They're basically in the desert.

00:17:25.360 --> 00:17:26.360
 We're on the planet Arrakis.

00:17:26.360 --> 00:17:27.360
 We get the idea.

00:17:27.360 --> 00:17:28.360
 Yeah, yeah.

00:17:28.360 --> 00:17:31.080
 But they've got these suits, which means they lose no moisture.

00:17:32.080 --> 00:17:34.000
 Emperor penguins are basically that bodily.

00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:35.500
 They just can't do it and not lose heat.

00:17:35.500 --> 00:17:38.600
 Yeah, they get so hot, like, you know, they do that huddling thing, the males, when there's

00:17:38.600 --> 00:17:42.160
 a blizzard and they all cuddle together, they can be like so hot, they have to break apart

00:17:42.160 --> 00:17:44.720
 and be like, oh, God, I need some steaming.

00:17:44.720 --> 00:17:45.720
 Yeah.

00:17:45.720 --> 00:17:49.000
 It sounds like more, it sounds more of a thing, which you wouldn't think because you see them

00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:52.720
 in documentaries and you feel so sorry for how cold they must be, but actually it seems

00:17:52.720 --> 00:17:54.360
 like overheating is more of a problem.

00:17:54.360 --> 00:17:55.360
 Actually, potentially more of a problem.

00:17:55.360 --> 00:17:56.360
 Yeah.

00:17:56.360 --> 00:17:59.120
 And I always thought that those big huddles where, you know, hundreds of them, as you

00:17:59.120 --> 00:18:01.960
 say, plump together, don't they, and they rotate, who's on the inside.

00:18:01.960 --> 00:18:04.080
 I always thought they lasted for ages.

00:18:04.080 --> 00:18:08.240
 That was kind of how they stood, but apparently it's about 50 minutes each one last.

00:18:08.240 --> 00:18:12.480
 And it's really like, yeah, when it blows through and it's really cold.

00:18:12.480 --> 00:18:14.480
 Do you think they don't feel cold then?

00:18:14.480 --> 00:18:17.760
 I think they would if they got cold.

00:18:17.760 --> 00:18:19.360
 It just sounds like that they don't.

00:18:19.360 --> 00:18:23.760
 Their threshold is just way lower than humans, so it's, I think it's down to minus 10 Celsius.

00:18:23.760 --> 00:18:24.760
 They're basically comfortable.

00:18:24.760 --> 00:18:30.000
 Well, actually that's the same as someone from Newcastle, I think.

00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:32.200
 That's why the black and white is the essence.

00:18:32.200 --> 00:18:34.320
 They're still a bit chilly then, I guess.

00:18:34.320 --> 00:18:37.880
 If minus 10, they're comfortable, minus 40, they're probably like, that's when they're

00:18:37.880 --> 00:18:39.680
 like, oh, let's all, you know, let's get through it.

00:18:39.680 --> 00:18:43.000
 Do they have human conceptions of discomfort in the way that we do, you know, I don't know.

00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:46.120
 Well, that comes back to the whole sentient thing, you know, that's kind of the big thing

00:18:46.120 --> 00:18:47.120
 of that.

00:18:47.120 --> 00:18:48.120
 It's like, are they suffering?

00:18:48.120 --> 00:18:51.000
 Is the first penguin dad to suggest a huddle looked on as a bit of a wuss?

00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:52.000
 Yeah.

00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:55.720
 Is everyone secretly hoping someone's going to do it, but no one wants to be the first

00:18:55.720 --> 00:18:56.720
 one?

00:18:56.720 --> 00:18:59.080
 Oh, I'm not going to hug you.

00:18:59.080 --> 00:19:01.600
 I'm just trying to eat.

00:19:01.600 --> 00:19:04.600
 One thing I like about the whole penguin feather thing is, if you've seen the video, if you've

00:19:04.600 --> 00:19:09.600
 seen kind of on Blue Planet or whatever it was, the emperor penguins whooshing up underwater

00:19:09.600 --> 00:19:13.120
 and jumping out, like they do this kind of leaps, right?

00:19:13.120 --> 00:19:16.200
 They basically, that's like, need to get out of the water because there's probably something

00:19:16.200 --> 00:19:20.880
 coming to eat me, but my little legs aren't going to be very good at clambering off onto

00:19:20.880 --> 00:19:21.880
 the ice.

00:19:21.880 --> 00:19:24.040
 So they swim up from deep down and it's skin that's their feathers.

00:19:24.040 --> 00:19:27.240
 So basically as they go down, they hold their contour feathers, the outside ones in place,

00:19:27.240 --> 00:19:29.640
 they lock them in place so that the air is trapped.

00:19:29.640 --> 00:19:33.320
 And then as they're coming up, they basically let that air out and it all comes fizzing out

00:19:33.320 --> 00:19:39.760
 of the little under fuzzy bits and forms a stream of bubbles and it's called air lubrication

00:19:39.760 --> 00:19:42.200
 and basically reduces the friction against the water.

00:19:42.200 --> 00:19:47.160
 And so they go a bit faster and they go popping out the water at the top and then they land

00:19:47.160 --> 00:19:50.760
 on the ice and they've got even, they've got a nice little tummy, the fronts are covered

00:19:50.760 --> 00:19:51.760
 with more feathers.

00:19:51.760 --> 00:19:53.360
 So when they land, it's nice cushion.

00:19:53.360 --> 00:19:54.360
 That is so cool.

00:19:54.360 --> 00:19:55.360
 That's not really good.

00:19:55.360 --> 00:20:00.480
 They've got tricks for days, they're really, they're a real risk of climate change, aren't

00:20:00.480 --> 00:20:01.480
 they?

00:20:01.480 --> 00:20:02.480
 Yeah, sadly, yes.

00:20:02.480 --> 00:20:06.380
 They live on sea ice and if sea ice melts, that's the, this bit, specifically this bit

00:20:06.380 --> 00:20:10.680
 with the males and the, and the chick rearing is on the sea ice and it's all on the outside,

00:20:10.680 --> 00:20:11.680
 isn't it?

00:20:11.680 --> 00:20:12.680
 Yeah, exactly.

00:20:12.680 --> 00:20:13.680
 Because they need access to the sea.

00:20:13.680 --> 00:20:17.780
 If the ice melts basically, then that means they, like lots of colonies have had complete

00:20:17.780 --> 00:20:21.600
 breeding failures where no chick survived to the next year and it's happened two years

00:20:21.600 --> 00:20:22.600
 in a row now.

00:20:22.600 --> 00:20:23.600
 It's really, it's really bad.

00:20:23.600 --> 00:20:24.600
 Yeah.

00:20:24.600 --> 00:20:28.120
 And I think the idea is that if the world keeps to 1.5 degrees of warming, then the numbers

00:20:28.120 --> 00:20:32.160
 will hold up much, much better than if it goes far beyond that, you know.

00:20:32.160 --> 00:20:34.440
 So that, yeah, no, it definitely matters.

00:20:34.440 --> 00:20:37.680
 Like every degree, every degree we can like avoid of heating, like the better the emperor

00:20:37.680 --> 00:20:38.680
 penguins will do.

00:20:38.680 --> 00:20:42.840
 And you know, like the cool thing I love about it as well is how we study numbers of penguins

00:20:42.840 --> 00:20:43.840
 is from satellites.

00:20:43.840 --> 00:20:47.600
 There's like once a week a satellite passes over Antarctica and takes photos and you

00:20:47.600 --> 00:20:51.780
 can only do that during the summer because it's dark during the winter, obviously, and

00:20:51.780 --> 00:20:53.900
 you can't see anything.

00:20:53.900 --> 00:20:56.980
 But in the summer months, they pass over and take photos and then you can count the penguins

00:20:56.980 --> 00:20:58.220
 and they're poo basically.

00:20:58.220 --> 00:21:00.500
 The guano stains the ice and you can see where they are.

00:21:00.500 --> 00:21:02.780
 So that's how you figure out how many there are.

00:21:02.780 --> 00:21:07.820
 And so basically the end of the winter, when the sun comes up again, it's like fingers crossed

00:21:07.820 --> 00:21:08.820
 everybody.

00:21:08.820 --> 00:21:10.020
 I like how many are still there?

00:21:10.020 --> 00:21:11.020
 Like how many of these...

00:21:11.020 --> 00:21:13.020
 You're looking for a huge poo on the ice.

00:21:13.020 --> 00:21:14.020
 Basically, yeah.

00:21:14.020 --> 00:21:15.020
 And then that's when we see.

00:21:15.020 --> 00:21:18.520
 This year, we won't know till because it's just going dark now.

00:21:18.520 --> 00:21:24.480
 We won't know till like September, October how this year's clutch of penguins has done.

00:21:24.480 --> 00:21:29.400
 I wonder if they take into account the level of poo by which I mean, like, let's say your

00:21:29.400 --> 00:21:33.480
 penguins are not eating very well for whatever reason.

00:21:33.480 --> 00:21:34.480
 They might poo less.

00:21:34.480 --> 00:21:37.060
 And I wonder if when they look at it, they can be honest.

00:21:37.060 --> 00:21:38.060
 Yeah.

00:21:38.060 --> 00:21:40.600
 I don't know whether they do the poo for individual numbers or whether they're just like, here's

00:21:40.600 --> 00:21:41.600
 a colony.

00:21:41.600 --> 00:21:42.600
 I see.

00:21:42.600 --> 00:21:43.600
 That's generally there.

00:21:43.600 --> 00:21:45.760
 You can actually see like a little shadow.

00:21:45.760 --> 00:21:46.760
 That's how good the satellites are.

00:21:46.760 --> 00:21:51.540
 You can see, and they're so tall that you can see a penguin's shadow in the satellite images

00:21:51.540 --> 00:21:52.940
 and then for count each individual.

00:21:52.940 --> 00:21:53.940
 Yeah.

00:21:53.940 --> 00:21:57.060
 And actually, I think one really interesting thing is you can tell how many individuals

00:21:57.060 --> 00:22:01.740
 there are in one of these huddles by knowing the size of the huddle and the temperature

00:22:01.740 --> 00:22:06.100
 outside because they're really mathematically precise.

00:22:06.100 --> 00:22:07.260
 They go into like hexagons.

00:22:07.260 --> 00:22:10.300
 You know how hexagons are the best way at packing things?

00:22:10.300 --> 00:22:14.400
 If you kind of take a big pile of penguins, you know how much they're huddling because

00:22:14.400 --> 00:22:18.240
 you know how cold it is and you just put a load of hexagons on that grid, that's how

00:22:18.240 --> 00:22:19.240
 many penguins there are.

00:22:19.240 --> 00:22:20.240
 Oh, what do you mean?

00:22:20.240 --> 00:22:21.240
 If it's colder, they'll go closer.

00:22:21.240 --> 00:22:22.240
 That'll suddenly tend to amnesia.

00:22:22.240 --> 00:22:23.240
 Yeah.

00:22:23.240 --> 00:22:26.000
 I don't know whether to be more impressed by scientists or penguins than that, as if

00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:28.040
 working that out is unbelievable.

00:22:28.040 --> 00:22:29.600
 Then working it out as penguins is unbelievable.

00:22:29.600 --> 00:22:31.000
 I'm just saying that's fine for everyone.

00:22:31.000 --> 00:22:32.000
 They're really cool.

00:22:32.000 --> 00:22:33.000
 Yeah.

00:22:33.000 --> 00:22:39.880
 I didn't know that part of Scott's expedition was about penguin eggs, collecting penguin

00:22:39.880 --> 00:22:40.880
 eggs.

00:22:40.880 --> 00:22:41.880
 So crazy.

00:22:41.880 --> 00:22:42.880
 It's Scott of the Antarctic.

00:22:42.880 --> 00:22:43.880
 Yeah.

00:22:43.880 --> 00:22:44.880
 That one.

00:22:44.880 --> 00:22:49.580
 So 1910 to 1913 is Teranova expedition, a lesser known part of it in I think 1911.

00:22:49.580 --> 00:22:50.580
 It's 11, yeah.

00:22:50.580 --> 00:22:55.760
 It was where three of them, so I think it was sort of the brainchild or the person who's

00:22:55.760 --> 00:22:59.820
 most passionate about it was Edward Wilson, who was Scott's second in command.

00:22:59.820 --> 00:23:04.900
 Then there was this other chap called Apsley Cherry Garrod, but they were there to go and

00:23:04.900 --> 00:23:08.780
 collect emperor penguin eggs, weren't they, because they believed it was going to be really

00:23:08.780 --> 00:23:09.780
 evolutionaryly important.

00:23:09.780 --> 00:23:10.780
 Yes, that's right.

00:23:10.780 --> 00:23:11.780
 A link between.

00:23:11.780 --> 00:23:12.780
 Yeah.

00:23:12.780 --> 00:23:15.520
 They thought they were the oldest birds, and that there was this theory of recapitulation,

00:23:15.520 --> 00:23:20.240
 which totally fell out of favor, but the idea that an embryo retraces its evolutionary

00:23:20.240 --> 00:23:22.160
 heritage of its ancestor.

00:23:22.160 --> 00:23:26.080
 So it would kind of basically start off in its egg as a little reptile, and then turn

00:23:26.080 --> 00:23:28.120
 into a bird as it was growing.

00:23:28.120 --> 00:23:32.360
 And so it kind of totally comes back to this whole like crazy winters and the males with

00:23:32.360 --> 00:23:36.240
 the eggs on their feet, because the only way to get an egg with an embryo in it is to go

00:23:36.240 --> 00:23:37.240
 in the middle of winter.

00:23:37.240 --> 00:23:38.240
 Absolutely.

00:23:38.240 --> 00:23:39.240
 Come out.

00:23:39.240 --> 00:23:40.240
 Yeah.

00:23:40.240 --> 00:23:42.260
 And not only is it freezing cold, of course, pitch dark.

00:23:42.260 --> 00:23:43.260
 Dark cold.

00:23:43.260 --> 00:23:44.900
 They kept falling down like holes in the ice.

00:23:44.900 --> 00:23:45.900
 It was so ridiculous.

00:23:45.900 --> 00:23:48.860
 But then surely you've also got to fight an angry dad.

00:23:48.860 --> 00:23:51.820
 It started his fighting weight, though, isn't it, at that stage?

00:23:51.820 --> 00:23:52.820
 Exactly.

00:23:52.820 --> 00:23:55.580
 So the three of them went, and then the three survived, but Cherry Garrod got back, and

00:23:55.580 --> 00:24:00.340
 he was so ill from this expedition that he didn't go on the bit to the south pole, which

00:24:00.340 --> 00:24:03.100
 is where Fowers and Wilson died with Scott.

00:24:03.100 --> 00:24:04.100
 Right.

00:24:04.100 --> 00:24:07.180
 But they did get the penguin eggs, but I mean, it sounds extraordinary.

00:24:07.180 --> 00:24:12.040
 So Cherry's teeth shattered so violently with the cold that they shattered, apparently.

00:24:12.040 --> 00:24:14.880
 Do you know how they kept warm as well?

00:24:14.880 --> 00:24:15.880
 How?

00:24:15.880 --> 00:24:16.880
 By burning penguins.

00:24:16.880 --> 00:24:17.880
 That's dark.

00:24:17.880 --> 00:24:18.880
 That's very dark.

00:24:18.880 --> 00:24:19.880
 How you do what you can.

00:24:19.880 --> 00:24:24.860
 I thought you'd say they had a lovely hug and a cuddle together, and now, oh, I'm not

00:24:24.860 --> 00:24:28.980
 hugging you, I'm going to burn this penguin.

00:24:28.980 --> 00:24:31.020
 I mean, that was when they went to the colony.

00:24:31.020 --> 00:24:36.320
 They grabbed a whole bunch of eggs, and they took some adult males, and they burnt them,

00:24:36.320 --> 00:24:37.320
 because they're really oily.

00:24:37.320 --> 00:24:38.320
 Yeah.

00:24:38.320 --> 00:24:40.180
 I was going to say, like, scuers, they burn quite well, don't they?

00:24:40.180 --> 00:24:41.180
 How do they?

00:24:41.180 --> 00:24:42.180
 They use those as lamps in Scotland.

00:24:42.180 --> 00:24:43.180
 Oh, they stick it.

00:24:43.180 --> 00:24:44.700
 Yeah, they stick a wick up there.

00:24:44.700 --> 00:24:45.700
 But yeah.

00:24:45.700 --> 00:24:50.580
 I mean, how strong are your ethical principles when you are near the south pole, and suddenly

00:24:50.580 --> 00:24:52.420
 you realise it's death or penguin burning?

00:24:52.420 --> 00:24:53.420
 In the name.

00:24:53.420 --> 00:24:54.420
 It was a couple of penguins.

00:24:54.420 --> 00:24:55.420
 Yeah.

00:24:55.420 --> 00:25:00.980
 It was, so it took him 45 minutes each night to chip into his frozen sleeping bag.

00:25:00.980 --> 00:25:04.620
 They probably burnt, like, the novels that they brought with them in the finish before

00:25:04.620 --> 00:25:06.120
 they burnt the penguin.

00:25:06.120 --> 00:25:07.120
 Yeah, probably.

00:25:07.120 --> 00:25:10.680
 I mean, not the dickens, because you need to keep holding the best ones.

00:25:10.680 --> 00:25:13.480
 Sorry, it took 45 minutes to chip into his sleeping bag.

00:25:13.480 --> 00:25:16.800
 Each night it would be a block of ice, and he said 45 minutes.

00:25:16.800 --> 00:25:20.440
 And all I've got is one of these pieces of my own tooth to chip away with.

00:25:20.440 --> 00:25:21.920
 Oh, my God.

00:25:21.920 --> 00:25:22.920
 That sounds...

00:25:22.920 --> 00:25:23.920
 Yeah.

00:25:23.920 --> 00:25:24.920
 Well, I'm going to bed.

00:25:24.920 --> 00:25:25.920
 You're going to bed early.

00:25:25.920 --> 00:25:26.920
 Yeah.

00:25:26.920 --> 00:25:27.920
 Yeah, I...

00:25:27.920 --> 00:25:28.920
 Got the old sleeping bag chipping to do.

00:25:28.920 --> 00:25:32.560
 There was also a thing where they had three sleds, I think, but they could only pull one

00:25:32.560 --> 00:25:33.640
 at a time.

00:25:33.640 --> 00:25:37.700
 So for every sort of mile they travelled, they had to do three back and forth.

00:25:37.700 --> 00:25:38.700
 Oh, my God.

00:25:38.700 --> 00:25:39.700
 Oh, my God.

00:25:39.700 --> 00:25:42.540
 And they couldn't leave the chicken on the sled at the same time as the crane.

00:25:42.540 --> 00:25:50.300
 I think we've got a penguin, an octopus, and a dolphin.

00:25:50.300 --> 00:25:59.000
 OK, it is time for fact number three, and that is Andy.

00:25:59.000 --> 00:26:03.580
 My fact is that when Queen Elizabeth II got married, the people of Levington Spa clubbed

00:26:03.580 --> 00:26:05.680
 together and bought her a washing machine.

00:26:05.680 --> 00:26:06.680
 Oh.

00:26:06.680 --> 00:26:07.680
 Yeah.

00:26:07.680 --> 00:26:08.680
 That's nice.

00:26:08.680 --> 00:26:09.680
 It's very nice.

00:26:09.680 --> 00:26:10.680
 Clumped together?

00:26:10.680 --> 00:26:13.600
 How expensive was the washing machine, or how little did each individual in Levington

00:26:13.600 --> 00:26:14.600
 Spa contribute?

00:26:14.600 --> 00:26:15.600
 Wow.

00:26:15.600 --> 00:26:16.600
 Wow.

00:26:16.600 --> 00:26:18.600
 Well, I'm sorry, but that's less than one penny, just isn't it?

00:26:18.600 --> 00:26:20.100
 Why do you take in everyone?

00:26:20.100 --> 00:26:23.000
 I'm sure they were more expensive in 1947, I guess.

00:26:23.000 --> 00:26:24.000
 Yeah.

00:26:24.000 --> 00:26:25.000
 Yeah.

00:26:25.000 --> 00:26:29.800
 It was also a time famously of massive deprivation after the war, and bread was rationed at this

00:26:29.800 --> 00:26:30.800
 point.

00:26:30.800 --> 00:26:33.180
 They all used their ration cards to buy her a washing machine.

00:26:33.180 --> 00:26:34.520
 Did she have one already?

00:26:34.520 --> 00:26:35.520
 Unclear.

00:26:35.520 --> 00:26:38.600
 I think out of diplomacy, she was a famously diplomatic woman.

00:26:38.600 --> 00:26:42.160
 She would never have said, "I actually have 16 washing machines in my different houses

00:26:42.160 --> 00:26:43.160
 everywhere."

00:26:43.160 --> 00:26:44.160
 Yeah.

00:26:44.160 --> 00:26:48.280
 So she was Princess Elizabeth at the time, because she wasn't yet Queen.

00:26:48.280 --> 00:26:50.880
 That's how it works.

00:26:50.880 --> 00:26:54.000
 And 1947, post-war, really poor time.

00:26:54.000 --> 00:26:57.280
 So lots of gifts were food, you know?

00:26:57.280 --> 00:26:58.280
 Wow.

00:26:58.280 --> 00:26:59.680
 And gifts from around the world.

00:26:59.680 --> 00:27:04.980
 She got given lots of dresses, most of which she gave away to other girls getting married

00:27:04.980 --> 00:27:06.780
 around her age around the same time.

00:27:06.780 --> 00:27:07.780
 That's cool.

00:27:07.780 --> 00:27:08.780
 Yeah.

00:27:08.780 --> 00:27:12.540
 The list of wedding presents, this is so weird, was published as a book, and you can buy it

00:27:12.540 --> 00:27:16.460
 today, and I have ordered it, and it hasn't been delivered yet.

00:27:16.460 --> 00:27:20.740
 So tune in next week, we're going to be doing the same thing again.

00:27:20.740 --> 00:27:21.740
 Wow.

00:27:21.740 --> 00:27:22.740
 Yeah.

00:27:22.740 --> 00:27:25.540
 But it's just weird present, like 500 cases of tin pineapple?

00:27:25.540 --> 00:27:28.260
 Can you guys do that much pineapple in your life?

00:27:28.260 --> 00:27:29.260
 I don't think I could.

00:27:29.260 --> 00:27:30.260
 No, I mean either.

00:27:30.260 --> 00:27:31.260
 There's the Governor of Queensland sent that.

00:27:31.260 --> 00:27:32.760
 I haven't had one tin this year.

00:27:32.760 --> 00:27:33.760
 Haven't you?

00:27:33.760 --> 00:27:34.760
 No.

00:27:34.760 --> 00:27:35.760
 Gosh.

00:27:35.760 --> 00:27:36.760
 Maybe after this.

00:27:36.760 --> 00:27:37.760
 Would you?

00:27:37.760 --> 00:27:40.060
 I think I had my first tin pineapple of the year yesterday.

00:27:40.060 --> 00:27:41.060
 That is a coincidence.

00:27:41.060 --> 00:27:42.060
 Wow.

00:27:42.060 --> 00:27:43.060
 Isn't it?

00:27:43.060 --> 00:27:44.060
 That bizarre.

00:27:44.060 --> 00:27:46.900
 Yes, it was part of a Panang curry.

00:27:46.900 --> 00:27:52.000
 People sent her stockings, which I find quite a personal thing to send someone.

00:27:52.000 --> 00:27:55.760
 And she got over 100 pairs, I think, hundreds of pairs of nylon stockings, which were a high-value

00:27:55.760 --> 00:27:59.900
 item nylon was a newly invented thing.

00:27:59.900 --> 00:28:03.420
 What would the equivalent be to Bitcoin, probably?

00:28:03.420 --> 00:28:12.760
 The people of Lemmington Spa chip together to get you one dogecoin.

00:28:12.760 --> 00:28:16.980
 Royal wedding gifts are often quite weird, aren't they?

00:28:16.980 --> 00:28:21.940
 Grace Kelly, friend of the podcast, she got a yacht for a nice gift.

00:28:21.940 --> 00:28:22.940
 Oh yeah.

00:28:22.940 --> 00:28:23.940
 Yes, please.

00:28:23.940 --> 00:28:26.440
 Yeah, which village clumped together to buy it?

00:28:26.440 --> 00:28:27.440
 Yeah.

00:28:27.440 --> 00:28:28.440
 It's better than washing machine, isn't it?

00:28:28.440 --> 00:28:31.960
 The interesting thing about that is it was a repurposed ship.

00:28:31.960 --> 00:28:37.680
 It was a yacht, and then it got turned into a ship for the war, and was used at Dunkirk

00:28:37.680 --> 00:28:40.320
 to help evacuate soldiers.

00:28:40.320 --> 00:28:44.240
 And then after the war, Anasis bought it again and turned it back into a yacht, and then gave

00:28:44.240 --> 00:28:46.240
 it to Grace Kelly as a wedding gift.

00:28:46.240 --> 00:28:49.720
 That's sort of recycling, sort of.

00:28:49.720 --> 00:28:54.340
 Sorry, which bin does this yacht go in?

00:28:54.340 --> 00:28:56.900
 Oh, that's great.

00:28:56.900 --> 00:28:58.300
 That's much better than the one I felt.

00:28:58.300 --> 00:29:02.080
 Prince Charles and Diana, when they got married, a council in Somerset said, "One tonne of

00:29:02.080 --> 00:29:03.080
 peat."

00:29:03.080 --> 00:29:04.080
 Oh.

00:29:04.080 --> 00:29:09.900
 He's a farmer, and you know, he's not a farmer as he, but he owns lots of farmers.

00:29:09.900 --> 00:29:12.140
 Yeah, but do you know that was a huge faux pas, really?

00:29:12.140 --> 00:29:13.140
 Oh yeah.

00:29:13.140 --> 00:29:16.060
 Sending excrement to a wedding is not a faux pas.

00:29:16.060 --> 00:29:17.060
 Oh, peat isn't excrement.

00:29:17.060 --> 00:29:18.060
 It's not excrement.

00:29:18.060 --> 00:29:19.060
 I need to do some basic lessons.

00:29:19.060 --> 00:29:20.060
 It is.

00:29:20.060 --> 00:29:21.060
 It was Sedgemoor District Council.

00:29:21.060 --> 00:29:24.480
 They sent him a tonne of peat, and this was exactly about the time that Charles was banning

00:29:24.480 --> 00:29:28.640
 peat, because he is very environmentally aware and has been for a very long time.

00:29:28.640 --> 00:29:33.740
 And in the ATC banned peat use on all of his farms, because, you know, it's a big biodiversity

00:29:33.740 --> 00:29:34.740
 area now.

00:29:34.740 --> 00:29:35.740
 Yeah, peat-free compost all that.

00:29:35.740 --> 00:29:36.740
 Yeah.

00:29:36.740 --> 00:29:38.240
 Also, it sequesters a lot of carbon, doesn't it?

00:29:38.240 --> 00:29:39.240
 Yeah.

00:29:39.240 --> 00:29:42.480
 Yes, although he knew that at the time, but he was very, you know, he predicted.

00:29:42.480 --> 00:29:45.760
 So, Sedgemoor, he screwed up, and that's...

00:29:45.760 --> 00:29:49.740
 One nice wedding gift I found is something that people get in Japan called the Venus

00:29:49.740 --> 00:29:50.740
 Flower Basket.

00:29:50.740 --> 00:29:51.740
 Oh, yes.

00:29:51.740 --> 00:29:52.740
 Do you know it?

00:29:52.740 --> 00:29:53.740
 I know this one, yeah.

00:29:53.740 --> 00:29:54.740
 Go on.

00:29:54.740 --> 00:29:55.740
 Tell us what it is.

00:29:55.740 --> 00:30:00.060
 So, it's a deep sea sponge that's a glass sponge that they made out of kind of silica,

00:30:00.060 --> 00:30:01.060
 basically.

00:30:01.060 --> 00:30:06.980
 They look like a very ornate stocking, so a bit sort of like a woven knitted stocking.

00:30:06.980 --> 00:30:10.540
 And then there are these shrimp that live inside them, and they get inside them when

00:30:10.540 --> 00:30:14.820
 they're larvae, so they can sort of go through the holes of this glassy sponge thing.

00:30:14.820 --> 00:30:18.420
 And then they get trapped, and so, basically, you have a male and a female that are trapped

00:30:18.420 --> 00:30:20.840
 inside this sponge and can't get out.

00:30:20.840 --> 00:30:23.460
 And that's like a marriage.

00:30:23.460 --> 00:30:24.460
 Exactly.

00:30:24.460 --> 00:30:25.460
 Exactly.

00:30:25.460 --> 00:30:28.940
 And they send their babies off into the world through the holes of their sponge, but they

00:30:28.940 --> 00:30:30.440
 stay their entire life inside this sponge.

00:30:30.440 --> 00:30:31.440
 Yeah, it is that.

00:30:31.440 --> 00:30:34.440
 It's because, like, the male and the female stay together the rest of their lives, isn't

00:30:34.440 --> 00:30:35.440
 it?

00:30:35.440 --> 00:30:37.880
 Well, it's a claustrophobic concept of marriage, isn't it?

00:30:37.880 --> 00:30:42.720
 Well, I also found this, like, because it's like this glass sponge is like in a framework,

00:30:42.720 --> 00:30:43.720
 isn't it?

00:30:43.720 --> 00:30:44.720
 It's like a lattice.

00:30:44.720 --> 00:30:49.820
 They found that the currents go into it, and they create, like, a little vortex, and it

00:30:49.820 --> 00:30:54.960
 means that when the male and the female release their sperm and eggs, it's the perfect vortex

00:30:54.960 --> 00:30:56.940
 to make them all sort of mixed together.

00:30:56.940 --> 00:30:57.940
 Oh, cool.

00:30:57.940 --> 00:30:59.440
 That's quite romantic as well, isn't it?

00:30:59.440 --> 00:31:00.440
 It is.

00:31:00.440 --> 00:31:01.440
 It's lovely.

00:31:01.440 --> 00:31:07.940
 I've heard as well that they designed the gherkin in London around the skyscraper, around this

00:31:07.940 --> 00:31:13.520
 sort of shape of a sponge as well, and it was like, rather than water and other things,

00:31:13.520 --> 00:31:14.520
 circulating around it.

00:31:14.520 --> 00:31:17.160
 It's for air conditioning, and it pulls the air in, and it goes up the building.

00:31:17.160 --> 00:31:21.760
 Do not release sperm around the gherkin if you're looking for love.

00:31:21.760 --> 00:31:23.760
 Just to see what happens.

00:31:23.760 --> 00:31:29.120
 The building security and the cleaning team will both be the fact.

00:31:29.120 --> 00:31:30.120
 That's so interesting.

00:31:30.120 --> 00:31:31.120
 Wow.

00:31:31.120 --> 00:31:32.120
 That's very cool.

00:31:32.120 --> 00:31:33.120
 Yeah.

00:31:33.120 --> 00:31:34.120
 Will you do a washing machine thing or two?

00:31:34.120 --> 00:31:35.120
 No, washing machines.

00:31:35.120 --> 00:31:36.120
 Yeah.

00:31:36.120 --> 00:31:37.120
 They're bad.

00:31:37.120 --> 00:31:38.120
 Are they?

00:31:38.120 --> 00:31:40.080
 Yeah, washing machines are bad.

00:31:40.080 --> 00:31:47.320
 Classic cloth washing accounts for 35% of primary microplastics found in the environment, and

00:31:47.320 --> 00:31:52.960
 they're trying to come up with a law where all new washing machines have to have a filter

00:31:52.960 --> 00:31:53.960
 in them.

00:31:53.960 --> 00:31:57.880
 It's already the law in France, I think, but at the moment it's not the law in the UK,

00:31:57.880 --> 00:31:59.160
 and it needs to be the law in the UK.

00:31:59.160 --> 00:32:02.360
 Does that stop the microplastics getting out and into the water system?

00:32:02.360 --> 00:32:03.360
 Yeah.

00:32:03.360 --> 00:32:04.360
 That's a filter, yeah.

00:32:04.360 --> 00:32:06.840
 When you say synthetic fabrics, I've got a ...

00:32:06.840 --> 00:32:09.760
 That T-shirt you're wearing, I would say ... Oh, it's cotton, I guess.

00:32:09.760 --> 00:32:14.400
 No, I think you're talking more like fleeces and ... Yeah, like polyester.

00:32:14.400 --> 00:32:15.400
 Polyester.

00:32:15.400 --> 00:32:16.400
 Oh, okay.

00:32:16.400 --> 00:32:19.200
 Polyester fleeces are particularly bad because they just shed loads of fibres.

00:32:19.200 --> 00:32:21.000
 Why would you ever wash a fleece?

00:32:21.000 --> 00:32:22.000
 I mean, a good point.

00:32:22.000 --> 00:32:23.000
 I think you don't.

00:32:23.000 --> 00:32:24.000
 You don't, really.

00:32:24.000 --> 00:32:25.000
 Next time don't.

00:32:25.000 --> 00:32:29.280
 I'm at the school of like, if it's an outer layer, you never wash it.

00:32:29.280 --> 00:32:30.280
 No.

00:32:30.280 --> 00:32:31.280
 Unless you've fallen a swamp.

00:32:31.280 --> 00:32:32.280
 Oh, yeah.

00:32:32.280 --> 00:32:35.000
 And if you're wearing your fleece, you might be ... What if a bird poo's on you?

00:32:35.000 --> 00:32:36.000
 Oh, yeah.

00:32:36.000 --> 00:32:37.000
 Just wipe it.

00:32:37.000 --> 00:32:40.480
 Wait until it's dry and then a stiff, ah, hog's back with a brush.

00:32:40.480 --> 00:32:41.480
 Yeah, honestly.

00:32:41.480 --> 00:32:45.520
 Do you know that the first fleeces were called synthetic chinchillas?

00:32:45.520 --> 00:32:46.520
 No, stop it.

00:32:46.520 --> 00:32:47.520
 Yeah, yeah.

00:32:47.520 --> 00:32:48.520
 I think that's right.

00:32:48.520 --> 00:32:49.520
 When was that?

00:32:49.520 --> 00:32:50.520
 When.

00:32:50.520 --> 00:32:51.520
 Yeah, roughly.

00:32:51.520 --> 00:32:52.520
 20th century.

00:32:52.520 --> 00:32:53.520
 Get away.

00:32:53.520 --> 00:32:54.520
 20th century, yeah.

00:32:54.520 --> 00:32:55.520
 Because before that, people were wearing chinchillas.

00:32:55.520 --> 00:32:56.520
 Real chinchilla.

00:32:56.520 --> 00:32:57.520
 Yeah.

00:32:57.520 --> 00:33:01.600
 I think chinchilla was a name of a fabric that was kind of similar to what a chinchilla

00:33:01.600 --> 00:33:04.680
 was, but it was like, it was made of cotton, but it was called chinchilla.

00:33:04.680 --> 00:33:05.680
 That's funny.

00:33:05.680 --> 00:33:06.680
 And then there's the synthetic chinchilla.

00:33:06.680 --> 00:33:07.680
 I think that's right.

00:33:07.680 --> 00:33:08.680
 That's amazing.

00:33:08.680 --> 00:33:10.840
 I run it because actually they're sort of chin-warmers, aren't they?

00:33:10.840 --> 00:33:11.840
 That's very right.

00:33:11.840 --> 00:33:12.840
 Yeah.

00:33:12.840 --> 00:33:13.840
 Gas.

00:33:13.840 --> 00:33:14.840
 Gas.

00:33:14.840 --> 00:33:15.840
 Good grief.

00:33:15.840 --> 00:33:16.840
 Can I tell you a washing machine fact?

00:33:16.840 --> 00:33:17.840
 Yeah.

00:33:17.840 --> 00:33:18.840
 Sure.

00:33:18.840 --> 00:33:19.840
 This is good.

00:33:19.840 --> 00:33:20.840
 So you know the Samsung jingle?

00:33:20.840 --> 00:33:21.840
 The Samsung jingle.

00:33:21.840 --> 00:33:22.840
 No?

00:33:22.840 --> 00:33:23.840
 That's not one of the things.

00:33:23.840 --> 00:33:25.840
 When you're washing machine finishes, it plays a little tune.

00:33:25.840 --> 00:33:26.840
 Samsung.

00:33:26.840 --> 00:33:27.840
 Is this the Samsung?

00:33:27.840 --> 00:33:28.840
 Yeah.

00:33:28.840 --> 00:33:29.840
 No, I don't know it.

00:33:29.840 --> 00:33:30.840
 Yeah, there's a tune.

00:33:30.840 --> 00:33:31.840
 Well, lots of washing machines.

00:33:31.840 --> 00:33:33.960
 My washing machine just goes beep, beep, beep, and it's finished.

00:33:33.960 --> 00:33:36.800
 Does it go dum, dum, dum, or something like that?

00:33:36.800 --> 00:33:37.800
 Nope.

00:33:37.800 --> 00:33:38.800
 No.

00:33:38.800 --> 00:33:39.800
 That's an announcement on the underground.

00:33:39.800 --> 00:33:40.800
 I think.

00:33:40.800 --> 00:33:41.800
 Yeah.

00:33:41.800 --> 00:33:44.640
 I installed the wrong thing in my kitchen.

00:33:44.640 --> 00:33:49.640
 Is the one that goes dum, dum, dum, dum, dum, dum, dum, dum, dum, dum, dum, dum, dum,

00:33:49.640 --> 00:33:50.640
 dum, dum, dum, dum.

00:33:50.640 --> 00:33:51.640
 Really?

00:33:51.640 --> 00:33:52.640
 Really?

00:33:52.640 --> 00:33:53.640
 I don't know.

00:33:53.640 --> 00:33:54.640
 And it's really long, right?

00:33:54.640 --> 00:33:55.640
 So this is so mad.

00:33:55.640 --> 00:33:56.640
 It was composed in 1817.

00:33:56.640 --> 00:33:57.640
 The Samsung washing machine jingle.

00:33:57.640 --> 00:33:58.640
 For this.

00:33:58.640 --> 00:33:59.640
 For this in mind.

00:33:59.640 --> 00:34:00.640
 For this.

00:34:00.640 --> 00:34:01.640
 It's Franz Schubert.

00:34:01.640 --> 00:34:02.640
 Wow.

00:34:02.640 --> 00:34:03.640
 I know.

00:34:03.640 --> 00:34:04.640
 It's a song.

00:34:04.640 --> 00:34:05.640
 It's called The Trout.

00:34:05.640 --> 00:34:06.640
 So there's an aquatic theme.

00:34:06.640 --> 00:34:07.640
 Oh, OK.

00:34:07.640 --> 00:34:11.600
 And it's based on a poem, a different, confusingly, a German writer called Schubert.

00:34:11.600 --> 00:34:12.600
 Wow.

00:34:12.600 --> 00:34:17.800
 And it's about a trout that gets caught by a fisherman, and it's a warning to young women

00:34:17.800 --> 00:34:19.160
 to stay away from men.

00:34:19.160 --> 00:34:20.320
 Well, there you are.

00:34:20.320 --> 00:34:21.320
 Yeah.

00:34:21.320 --> 00:34:25.000
 And this is the tune that is in every Samsung washing machine, and it's a little sort of

00:34:25.000 --> 00:34:28.880
 ceremonial ditty that plays at the end of, and I have one of those washing machines.

00:34:28.880 --> 00:34:31.000
 I hear that tune a couple of times a week.

00:34:31.000 --> 00:34:35.080
 Your wife leaves the house.

00:34:35.080 --> 00:34:38.200
 What a multi-layered fact there are so many bits to grasp there.

00:34:38.200 --> 00:34:41.440
 Well, I mean, to start off with, I didn't know Samsung made washing machines.

00:34:41.440 --> 00:34:43.520
 I thought they made TVs.

00:34:43.520 --> 00:34:44.520
 Right.

00:34:44.520 --> 00:34:45.520
 That's the foothills of this fact.

00:34:45.520 --> 00:34:46.520
 Yeah.

00:34:46.520 --> 00:34:47.520
 Schubert and Schubert.

00:34:47.520 --> 00:34:51.320
 I want to know about that comedy double up.

00:34:51.320 --> 00:34:53.960
 Can I ask you guys a question about your washing machines?

00:34:53.960 --> 00:34:56.240
 How much washing powder do you tend to put in?

00:34:56.240 --> 00:35:00.760
 I just put one of those, like, you know, those tide pod things that Americans eat.

00:35:00.760 --> 00:35:01.760
 I put one of those.

00:35:01.760 --> 00:35:04.760
 Oh, you do the tide pod.

00:35:04.760 --> 00:35:05.960
 Yeah, just a scoop.

00:35:05.960 --> 00:35:06.960
 I don't use powder.

00:35:06.960 --> 00:35:07.960
 I use liquid.

00:35:07.960 --> 00:35:08.960
 Nice.

00:35:08.960 --> 00:35:10.480
 From a refill shop.

00:35:10.480 --> 00:35:11.480
 Well done.

00:35:11.480 --> 00:35:12.480
 For the on message.

00:35:12.480 --> 00:35:13.960
 Yeah, just a cup of that.

00:35:13.960 --> 00:35:14.960
 Oh, okay.

00:35:14.960 --> 00:35:15.960
 A lid.

00:35:15.960 --> 00:35:20.520
 Good, but I'm afraid it's not quite as good as the old reusable egg full of dry granules

00:35:20.520 --> 00:35:21.520
 that I use.

00:35:21.520 --> 00:35:22.520
 Oh!

00:35:22.520 --> 00:35:23.520
 I've got one of those.

00:35:23.520 --> 00:35:26.640
 You do have to fly down to the Antarctic to get the egg, don't you?

00:35:26.640 --> 00:35:31.680
 That's why I've lost all these teeth in front teeth of mine.

00:35:31.680 --> 00:35:32.880
 Is that right?

00:35:32.880 --> 00:35:33.880
 You wash with a reusable egg.

00:35:33.880 --> 00:35:37.640
 There's a little plastic egg, which is full of dry granules, and they last about, like,

00:35:37.640 --> 00:35:40.800
 a hundred washes or something, and you just replace those dry granules.

00:35:40.800 --> 00:35:42.480
 I wondered why you spelt so bad.

00:35:42.480 --> 00:35:44.840
 Like, it works, it's really good.

00:35:44.840 --> 00:35:49.520
 That's a much better public service announcement than mine, which is if you're just using normal

00:35:49.520 --> 00:35:54.480
 washing powder, you should never need to use more than really a tablespoon, which is much,

00:35:54.480 --> 00:35:56.320
 much less than you're probably using.

00:35:56.320 --> 00:36:00.600
 This is a New York Times expose, and it's really bad to overuse it because it makes your clothes

00:36:00.600 --> 00:36:01.600
 go all crunchy.

00:36:01.600 --> 00:36:06.800
 Can I ask Anna, as someone who has a toddler who's currently potty training, and so I often

00:36:06.800 --> 00:36:11.120
 have urine and feces stains on my clothing, is it different for me?

00:36:11.120 --> 00:36:15.520
 It says for extremely heavy loads, you might want two tablespoons, but you're never going

00:36:15.520 --> 00:36:17.040
 to need more than that.

00:36:17.040 --> 00:36:18.040
 Thank you.

00:36:18.040 --> 00:36:21.160
 And they're lying to you, the companies, with their cups on the list because they just want

00:36:21.160 --> 00:36:22.160
 to get through it.

00:36:22.160 --> 00:36:23.160
 Exactly, and they keep a little scoop, don't they?

00:36:23.160 --> 00:36:24.600
 Oh, it's in their interest.

00:36:24.600 --> 00:36:25.600
 Yeah.

00:36:25.600 --> 00:36:26.600
 There you go.

00:36:26.600 --> 00:36:27.600
 Big core, big powder.

00:36:27.600 --> 00:36:31.080
 But, because I've always thought the whole thing's a scam, and what I've always thought

00:36:31.080 --> 00:36:34.200
 is the whole washing clothes thing, it's a scam.

00:36:34.200 --> 00:36:37.880
 The thing I've always thought is the drawer thing, got to be a scam, so I've always put

00:36:37.880 --> 00:36:38.880
 everything in the drum.

00:36:38.880 --> 00:36:39.880
 Yeah, I do that as well.

00:36:39.880 --> 00:36:43.080
 Well, what I've realized, if you use fabric softener, if you put that in the drum, which

00:36:43.080 --> 00:36:48.600
 I always have done, it's completely pointless, and it's because it's to do with the charging

00:36:48.600 --> 00:36:49.600
 of it.

00:36:49.600 --> 00:36:52.880
 So fabric softener is partly there to stop your static clothes sticking together, and

00:36:52.880 --> 00:36:56.920
 it does that by being positively charged so that the negatively charged clothes bind with

00:36:56.920 --> 00:36:58.420
 it and become neutralized.

00:36:58.420 --> 00:37:03.320
 So there you go, that's kind of what it does, but it has the opposite charge to your washing

00:37:03.320 --> 00:37:07.480
 powder, so if you put them in at the same time in the drum, they cancel each other out,

00:37:07.480 --> 00:37:09.280
 and it doesn't do any good.

00:37:09.280 --> 00:37:14.240
 So if you are like me, and you're just tipping your fabric softener in the drum, stop it,

00:37:14.240 --> 00:37:16.560
 and stop using all of it and be more ethical like these guys.

00:37:16.560 --> 00:37:17.560
 Get the egg.

00:37:17.560 --> 00:37:18.560
 Get the plaster.

00:37:18.560 --> 00:37:19.560
 I swear, get the egg in the granules.

00:37:19.560 --> 00:37:20.560
 Get the giant penguin egg.

00:37:20.560 --> 00:37:21.560
 Yeah.

00:37:21.560 --> 00:37:22.560
 Get it in the washing machine.

00:37:22.560 --> 00:37:23.560
 Yeah.

00:37:23.560 --> 00:37:24.560
 Wow.

00:37:24.560 --> 00:37:25.560
 Yeah.

00:37:25.560 --> 00:37:26.880
 I'm going to study one wedding present thing.

00:37:26.880 --> 00:37:31.720
 So it's based on a fact I discovered, which is that in 2015, Cristiano Ronaldo bought his

00:37:31.720 --> 00:37:36.440
 agent, George Mendes and his wife, Sandra, Greek Island as the present.

00:37:36.440 --> 00:37:37.440
 So they're best friends.

00:37:37.440 --> 00:37:39.960
 I think he was best man at his wedding, or vice versa.

00:37:39.960 --> 00:37:43.680
 So they're very close, health sweet, bought in the Greek Island, and I was just like,

00:37:43.680 --> 00:37:45.680
 how do you buy someone a Greek Island?

00:37:45.680 --> 00:37:51.520
 And do you know this website called privateislandsonline.com, which just has loads of islands for

00:37:51.520 --> 00:37:52.520
 sale.

00:37:52.520 --> 00:37:56.640
 And this, when Greece went through the credit crunch, I didn't realise, but lots of economists

00:37:56.640 --> 00:38:00.480
 advise, and eventually they went with it, advise that they put up a bunch of their islands

00:38:00.480 --> 00:38:02.720
 for sale to make back some of the money.

00:38:02.720 --> 00:38:04.840
 I have been on this website, I think.

00:38:04.840 --> 00:38:06.320
 Have you got an island?

00:38:06.320 --> 00:38:12.200
 No, I think like if memory serves, you go on, and it's like some of them are like not beyond

00:38:12.200 --> 00:38:16.800
 the realms of possibility of someone like me could buy, but it's always like a tiny island

00:38:16.800 --> 00:38:24.280
 in a lock, in the northernmost part of Scotland, and it says no electricity, no water, no ability

00:38:24.280 --> 00:38:25.280
 to get to the island.

00:38:25.280 --> 00:38:30.200
 Well, you know, you'd be living a little bit off-grid, yes, but I still think the cheapest

00:38:30.200 --> 00:38:33.960
 Greek one I found was five million US dollars.

00:38:33.960 --> 00:38:35.320
 So if, you know...

00:38:35.320 --> 00:38:36.320
 If we all club together...

00:38:36.320 --> 00:38:40.520
 If those bastards in Levington's bar actually chipped in, and dug deep.

00:38:40.520 --> 00:38:44.720
 Maybe, I don't know what the mortgage offers are on this.

00:38:44.720 --> 00:38:48.680
 It's Strogillo Island, or Strogillo Island, it's got beaches around the edge.

00:38:48.680 --> 00:38:52.120
 OK, here we are, no such thing as a fish island.

00:38:52.120 --> 00:38:56.720
 Everyone is listening, chips in a bit, and everyone gets to go there.

00:38:56.720 --> 00:38:57.720
 OK, lovely.

00:38:57.720 --> 00:38:58.720
 I love it, let's do it.

00:38:58.720 --> 00:39:02.440
 We can get five million dollars, it's 54 acres, so we could all fit.

00:39:02.440 --> 00:39:05.480
 Is there anything on it?

00:39:05.480 --> 00:39:08.200
 Some trees, it's very green, it's very verdant.

00:39:08.200 --> 00:39:09.200
 Sounds lovely.

00:39:09.200 --> 00:39:12.960
 Oh, and it's got power in some, I mean...

00:39:12.960 --> 00:39:13.960
 The power station.

00:39:13.960 --> 00:39:18.640
 There is a new clear power station in the middle, and it had a little hiccup a few years ago,

00:39:18.640 --> 00:39:20.400
 but honestly, it's fine.

00:39:20.400 --> 00:39:22.640
 It's fine, it's fine.

00:39:22.640 --> 00:39:25.720
 Anyway, just something to bear in mind, I think.

00:39:25.720 --> 00:39:27.000
 Yes, get that kickstart to go.

00:39:27.000 --> 00:39:28.000
 Yeah, I think I will.

00:39:28.000 --> 00:39:29.000
 Get an island.

00:39:29.000 --> 00:39:30.000
 Lovely.

00:39:30.000 --> 00:39:32.880
 Can I do animal gifts, wedding gifts?

00:39:32.880 --> 00:39:35.560
 Can we do this quickly?

00:39:35.560 --> 00:39:38.480
 Technically known as not-pretty-all-gifts, and there are lots of animals that give each

00:39:38.480 --> 00:39:40.600
 other a presence before mating.

00:39:40.600 --> 00:39:43.600
 Did you know about this?

00:39:43.600 --> 00:39:49.240
 So, usually the males, occasionally it's females that offer something, and it's usually food.

00:39:49.240 --> 00:39:53.280
 But the really cool one I found was the nursery web spider.

00:39:53.280 --> 00:39:57.580
 So the males approach the female and give her a gift of usually an insect, and he wraps

00:39:57.580 --> 00:39:59.640
 them up in silk.

00:39:59.640 --> 00:40:05.200
 And the females prefer the wrapped ones, they like the white, shiny, wrapped-up presents.

00:40:05.200 --> 00:40:09.360
 But he'll give her the present, and she will open it and start eating it.

00:40:09.360 --> 00:40:13.520
 And meanwhile, he's getting busy with what he needs to do, so they start mating while

00:40:13.520 --> 00:40:18.480
 she's opening her present right there, and generally-

00:40:18.480 --> 00:40:19.480
 She's awake.

00:40:19.480 --> 00:40:21.480
 You just wait until I'm awake.

00:40:21.480 --> 00:40:22.480
 No, no.

00:40:22.480 --> 00:40:23.480
 It's sort of the whole point.

00:40:23.480 --> 00:40:24.480
 And if she can-

00:40:24.480 --> 00:40:25.480
 At least sing happy birthday.

00:40:25.480 --> 00:40:26.480
 No, no.

00:40:26.480 --> 00:40:27.480
 He's mating while she's-

00:40:27.480 --> 00:40:32.520
 So she's opening the present, but basically, because it's wrapped up, he can cheat, and

00:40:32.520 --> 00:40:34.440
 they don't always put something inside.

00:40:34.440 --> 00:40:35.440
 No way.

00:40:35.440 --> 00:40:36.440
 That's so funny.

00:40:36.440 --> 00:40:37.440
 It's like deal or no deal.

00:40:37.440 --> 00:40:38.440
 Yeah, yeah.

00:40:38.440 --> 00:40:43.260
 So basically, some of them are like, "Well, I'll just put this whole piece of shit in

00:40:43.260 --> 00:40:44.260
 here."

00:40:44.260 --> 00:40:46.960
 No one's going to know until she's opened it, because it takes a bit of time.

00:40:46.960 --> 00:40:50.080
 And if she opens it and she's like, "What is the-" Okay.

00:40:50.080 --> 00:40:51.080
 And then basically-

00:40:51.080 --> 00:40:52.080
 Too late.

00:40:52.080 --> 00:40:53.080
 Too late.

00:40:53.080 --> 00:40:54.080
 I've done enough.

00:40:54.080 --> 00:40:55.080
 Yeah.

00:40:55.080 --> 00:40:56.080
 And so then she'll be like, "No, off you get.

00:40:56.080 --> 00:40:57.080
 We're going now."

00:40:57.080 --> 00:40:58.080
 But the male-

00:40:58.080 --> 00:40:59.080
 They also do a thing where-

00:40:59.080 --> 00:41:00.680
 So Hickton, I mean, this is from the paper, actually.

00:41:00.680 --> 00:41:03.360
 There's a study of this, and I just thought this is a lovely sentence.

00:41:03.360 --> 00:41:08.720
 However, if the female moves and attempts to terminate the copulation, the male may

00:41:08.720 --> 00:41:12.360
 perform Thanatosis, which is death-thaining behavior.

00:41:12.360 --> 00:41:15.960
 He stretches out his legs, which is unique to this species.

00:41:15.960 --> 00:41:22.120
 The male then ends the insertion and grasps the gift with his chelicerae, which was like

00:41:22.120 --> 00:41:23.360
 mouth parts.

00:41:23.360 --> 00:41:27.320
 And then the female moves away while holding onto the gift, and the male is dragged along

00:41:27.320 --> 00:41:34.840
 behind the female until eventually she'll give up, and then he revives and resumes

00:41:34.840 --> 00:41:35.840
 mating.

00:41:35.840 --> 00:41:36.840
 Wait.

00:41:36.840 --> 00:41:39.160
 Okay, I was going to ask what his end game is here, because I thought he was just trying

00:41:39.160 --> 00:41:40.160
 to get the present back.

00:41:40.160 --> 00:41:41.160
 Yeah, me too.

00:41:41.160 --> 00:41:42.160
 Do we gift it?

00:41:42.160 --> 00:41:44.360
 Well, I don't think we really know.

00:41:44.360 --> 00:41:49.080
 I mean, his end game is to basically try and make it as long as possible, because the

00:41:49.080 --> 00:41:52.160
 longer they go, the more chance they have of fertilizing.

00:41:52.160 --> 00:41:53.160
 And so basically breaking-

00:41:53.160 --> 00:41:56.400
 Like, giving her a crap present is not a great idea, because she will be like, "No,

00:41:56.400 --> 00:41:58.320
 I'm going to stop now because there's nothing in here."

00:41:58.320 --> 00:42:01.200
 And the better the present you get, the more time, but it seems that sometimes they just

00:42:01.200 --> 00:42:04.360
 don't have anything, or they're really hungry, and they eat the gift first, so they take

00:42:04.360 --> 00:42:08.280
 the insect, they eat it.

00:42:08.280 --> 00:42:12.200
 Honestly, I did buy you a bottle of wine, but it was a long-training journey.

00:42:12.200 --> 00:42:14.200
 Anyway, here's the bottle.

00:42:14.200 --> 00:42:15.200
 Exactly.

00:42:15.200 --> 00:42:17.760
 Hannah, stop mixing with me.

00:42:17.760 --> 00:42:21.680
 And you never invited me back.

00:42:21.680 --> 00:42:29.040
 Hannah fainting death to me, slunching the white bottle in her mouth.

00:42:29.040 --> 00:42:37.480
 OK, it's time for our final fact, and that is James.

00:42:37.480 --> 00:42:42.880
 OK, my fact this week is that hermit crabs are facing a housing crisis.

00:42:42.880 --> 00:42:43.880
 Join the club.

00:42:43.880 --> 00:42:44.880
 Oh, this is so sad.

00:42:44.880 --> 00:42:45.880
 Sorry, Belle, everyone.

00:42:45.880 --> 00:42:46.880
 Dink, dink, dink.

00:42:46.880 --> 00:42:47.880
 What do you mean?

00:42:47.880 --> 00:42:58.000
 I think it's relatively self-explanatory in that hermit crabs, as you might know, don't

00:42:58.000 --> 00:43:03.200
 have their own shells, so they go and find a new shell, and usually it's one that's discarded.

00:43:03.200 --> 00:43:06.360
 But it turns out that there aren't as many shells as there used to be.

00:43:06.360 --> 00:43:08.320
 There's various different reasons.

00:43:08.320 --> 00:43:15.360
 One reason is because gastropods, shell creatures are shrinking, the populations are shrinking.

00:43:15.360 --> 00:43:21.720
 But the paper's basically analysed photographs of crabs online and found--

00:43:21.720 --> 00:43:23.240
 Social media pictures of hermit crabs.

00:43:23.240 --> 00:43:24.240
 Pretty much, yeah.

00:43:24.240 --> 00:43:29.000
 They basically went onto Instagram and looked for hermit crabs, and found loads of pictures

00:43:29.000 --> 00:43:32.880
 of them using bottle caps, soda cans, Lego bricks.

00:43:32.880 --> 00:43:38.440
 A really scary bit is the broken end of a light bulb, so the metal bit that you screw

00:43:38.440 --> 00:43:40.880
 in, they used that.

00:43:40.880 --> 00:43:41.880
 Yeah.

00:43:41.880 --> 00:43:44.200
 It's quite a few pictures of hermit crabs.

00:43:44.200 --> 00:43:48.920
 I guess those are very durable in the ocean, I suppose, as they just last a lot of time,

00:43:48.920 --> 00:43:49.920
 don't they?

00:43:49.920 --> 00:43:52.200
 I think that's one of the other reasons they're doing it, just because it's what's there.

00:43:52.200 --> 00:43:53.200
 Right.

00:43:53.200 --> 00:43:54.200
 Yeah.

00:43:54.200 --> 00:43:57.040
 And there was another study in 2019 that found that half a million hermit crabs are dying

00:43:57.040 --> 00:44:00.440
 every year after getting stuck inside bottles and things like that.

00:44:00.440 --> 00:44:02.720
 So it's bad news for hermit crabs.

00:44:02.720 --> 00:44:03.720
 It is.

00:44:03.720 --> 00:44:05.000
 I mean, it's kind of mad.

00:44:05.000 --> 00:44:11.400
 Apparently as well, this plastic starts to smell like dead crabs, and that's one reason

00:44:11.400 --> 00:44:12.560
 why they come towards them.

00:44:12.560 --> 00:44:16.840
 So there's this stuff called dimethyl sulfide, which is this molecule that does all sorts

00:44:16.840 --> 00:44:20.240
 of important things like make clouds, and it comes off plankton in the ocean.

00:44:20.240 --> 00:44:25.120
 But it also, it's like, it's the smell of a rotting crab, but it sticks to the outside

00:44:25.120 --> 00:44:27.960
 of plastic stuff, plastic pollution in the ocean.

00:44:27.960 --> 00:44:33.000
 So one reason, possibly, why these crabs are going for the Coke bottle lids and yogurt

00:44:33.000 --> 00:44:36.360
 pots is because they think it smells like a dead crab, and therefore it's a shell that's

00:44:36.360 --> 00:44:39.440
 just been left behind by another crab.

00:44:39.440 --> 00:44:40.600
 Because you would use that naturally.

00:44:40.600 --> 00:44:41.600
 Yeah, yeah, exactly.

00:44:41.600 --> 00:44:43.840
 So the thermocrabs will use whatever they can find.

00:44:43.840 --> 00:44:48.840
 So in Madagascar, there was a beach where there's a big cliff full of fossil shells,

00:44:48.840 --> 00:44:52.640
 so really old shells, and the crabs will wait at the bottom of the cliff, waiting for the

00:44:52.640 --> 00:44:56.320
 fossils to drop out, and then they will use those as their home.

00:44:56.320 --> 00:44:57.320
 That's so cool.

00:44:57.320 --> 00:45:01.760
 That's like buying like a period property, like a listed building.

00:45:01.760 --> 00:45:03.260
 They're not allowed to decorate though.

00:45:03.260 --> 00:45:04.260
 No, no, no.

00:45:04.260 --> 00:45:05.260
 That's amazing.

00:45:05.260 --> 00:45:08.240
 So they will use all sorts of things.

00:45:08.240 --> 00:45:12.280
 It's really interesting what you said about how they'll go towards the smell of a dead

00:45:12.280 --> 00:45:16.200
 crab, because obviously in nature that's very unusual, isn't it?

00:45:16.200 --> 00:45:20.960
 Like usually if a member of your species has died, you would usually give that a bit of

00:45:20.960 --> 00:45:21.960
 a wide berth.

00:45:21.960 --> 00:45:23.460
 Yeah, unless you want to eat it.

00:45:23.460 --> 00:45:26.160
 Well, yeah, which is what they do, I think, as well, right?

00:45:26.160 --> 00:45:27.160
 They might do.

00:45:27.160 --> 00:45:28.160
 But yeah, you're right.

00:45:28.160 --> 00:45:29.160
 It's not a good smell.

00:45:29.160 --> 00:45:30.680
 Like carrion, rotting carrion is not.

00:45:30.680 --> 00:45:35.240
 So what happens is that sometimes they'll climb into a bottle, and because the bottle's

00:45:35.240 --> 00:45:36.680
 smooth, they can't get out.

00:45:36.680 --> 00:45:37.920
 So they'll die.

00:45:37.920 --> 00:45:42.480
 And then the smell of the dead crab comes out, and then the next crab goes, oh, great.

00:45:42.480 --> 00:45:44.760
 Dead crab goes into the bottle, and then they get stuck.

00:45:44.760 --> 00:45:46.040
 Oh, no, it's like a horror film.

00:45:46.040 --> 00:45:49.440
 And then the next crab goes to find that dead crab, and then you've got a bottle full of

00:45:49.440 --> 00:45:50.440
 dead crabs.

00:45:50.440 --> 00:45:51.440
 Oh, God.

00:45:51.440 --> 00:45:55.680
 And another kind of crazy thing about this is that maybe it's actually kind of makes

00:45:55.680 --> 00:45:59.680
 sense from the crab's point of view, because if there's a ton of plastic around and you

00:45:59.680 --> 00:46:03.160
 want to hide, then you hide inside the plastic.

00:46:03.160 --> 00:46:08.200
 And then predators might also not really have figured out that there might be crabs inside

00:46:08.200 --> 00:46:09.200
 of yoghurt pots.

00:46:09.200 --> 00:46:12.200
 And so they haven't kind of learned yet to go looking.

00:46:12.200 --> 00:46:15.880
 So it could be actually an advantage for the crabs.

00:46:15.880 --> 00:46:16.880
 And they're also lighter.

00:46:16.880 --> 00:46:17.880
 Yeah.

00:46:17.880 --> 00:46:18.880
 As a shell.

00:46:18.880 --> 00:46:19.880
 Yeah, they're all pretty flue.

00:46:19.880 --> 00:46:20.880
 They take almost no energy to pick up.

00:46:20.880 --> 00:46:21.880
 They're all really clever.

00:46:21.880 --> 00:46:24.200
 They sort of, the way they do it.

00:46:24.200 --> 00:46:27.000
 So they sometimes evict each other.

00:46:27.000 --> 00:46:31.760
 So if you have outgrown your shell and you spotted a hermit crab with a shell that would

00:46:31.760 --> 00:46:36.480
 be perfect for your current size, they go over and bang on the shell with their claws.

00:46:36.480 --> 00:46:37.480
 They do.

00:46:37.480 --> 00:46:39.440
 And before the fight breaks out, they'll show each other their claws.

00:46:39.440 --> 00:46:42.040
 Because if you've got the bigger claws, then generally you're the one who wins.

00:46:42.040 --> 00:46:43.560
 So they try not to have a fight.

00:46:43.560 --> 00:46:47.640
 They'll be like, look, I'm this big, and the other one will, they'll compare claw size.

00:46:47.640 --> 00:46:49.640
 And that can deflect fights.

00:46:49.640 --> 00:46:50.640
 That would be good.

00:46:50.640 --> 00:46:54.080
 You know, in boxing at the start, before the boxing fight, they always come up to each

00:46:54.080 --> 00:46:58.000
 other and sort of like stand head to head and sort of talk to each other.

00:46:58.000 --> 00:47:01.120
 It would be good if every time one of them just went, oh, no, I'm going to lose this.

00:47:01.120 --> 00:47:03.760
 You're way bigger than me.

00:47:03.760 --> 00:47:05.040
 Is that the weigh-in, James?

00:47:05.040 --> 00:47:06.040
 Yeah, yeah.

00:47:06.040 --> 00:47:07.040
 Are they actually weighed at that point?

00:47:07.040 --> 00:47:08.040
 Yes, they are.

00:47:08.040 --> 00:47:11.120
 Because in most weights, there's a maximum weight you can be, and they try and get as

00:47:11.120 --> 00:47:12.120
 close to that as possible.

00:47:12.120 --> 00:47:14.600
 And are they both, I've always wondered this about boxing, are they both standing on the

00:47:14.600 --> 00:47:15.600
 same set of scales?

00:47:15.600 --> 00:47:17.960
 Because they're standing right facing each other and looking at each other.

00:47:17.960 --> 00:47:20.480
 I always wonder if there's one big set of scales in the middle that they both have to

00:47:20.480 --> 00:47:21.480
 get on.

00:47:21.480 --> 00:47:25.700
 As in, like one of those balance scales that goes up and down, and now it's one set of

00:47:25.700 --> 00:47:26.700
 scales and they take turns.

00:47:26.700 --> 00:47:27.700
 Oh, they do?

00:47:27.700 --> 00:47:28.700
 Okay.

00:47:28.700 --> 00:47:29.700
 You've got to use the same set.

00:47:29.700 --> 00:47:30.700
 Oh, sure.

00:47:30.700 --> 00:47:31.700
 Yeah, yeah.

00:47:31.700 --> 00:47:34.080
 But it would be nice if there was a joint set, and they could both use it at the same time.

00:47:34.080 --> 00:47:35.320
 And if it goes over the weight.

00:47:35.320 --> 00:47:36.320
 Just a seesaw.

00:47:36.320 --> 00:47:37.320
 Exactly.

00:47:37.320 --> 00:47:38.320
 And it has to be exactly balanced.

00:47:38.320 --> 00:47:39.320
 Yeah.

00:47:39.320 --> 00:47:40.320
 And it would be nice, actually it would be nicer if in the middle of the boxing ring

00:47:40.320 --> 00:47:41.320
 was a seesaw.

00:47:41.320 --> 00:47:42.320
 And whoever wins the seesaw.

00:47:42.320 --> 00:47:43.320
 How do you win at seesaw?

00:47:43.320 --> 00:47:44.320
 Do not win.

00:47:44.320 --> 00:47:45.320
 Yeah.

00:47:45.320 --> 00:47:46.320
 That was a very competitive trial.

00:47:46.320 --> 00:47:47.320
 Absolutely.

00:47:47.320 --> 00:47:52.320
 Crush them on the little springy dogs at the park today.

00:47:52.320 --> 00:47:56.020
 Hermit crabs, hermit crabs.

00:47:56.020 --> 00:47:57.020
 Hermit crabs.

00:47:57.020 --> 00:48:00.340
 So they do actually decorate their homes quite well.

00:48:00.340 --> 00:48:04.060
 And so we've talked about the way they move house, but when they're living in their house,

00:48:04.060 --> 00:48:05.060
 they do various things.

00:48:05.060 --> 00:48:09.580
 The anemone hermit crab gets anemones and sticks them to its shell.

00:48:09.580 --> 00:48:13.380
 And I think it's because they've got stinging tentacles that affect other passers by.

00:48:13.380 --> 00:48:14.540
 And so it's a little bit of protection.

00:48:14.540 --> 00:48:19.580
 The anemone gets some food, but when they move shells, they do then take all the furniture

00:48:19.580 --> 00:48:20.580
 with them.

00:48:20.580 --> 00:48:21.580
 The flat doesn't come furnished.

00:48:21.580 --> 00:48:22.760
 So I think they spend ages.

00:48:22.760 --> 00:48:23.760
 Is this right?

00:48:23.760 --> 00:48:24.760
 They spent ages prizing off the anemones.

00:48:24.760 --> 00:48:25.760
 Yeah.

00:48:25.760 --> 00:48:26.760
 Yeah.

00:48:26.760 --> 00:48:30.400
 There's a species of deep sea anemone that was discovered just last year.

00:48:30.400 --> 00:48:32.960
 And they got a couple into the aquarium.

00:48:32.960 --> 00:48:35.040
 And this was a scientist in Japan.

00:48:35.040 --> 00:48:37.160
 And it spent two days trying to move the anemone.

00:48:37.160 --> 00:48:38.160
 Wow.

00:48:38.160 --> 00:48:39.160
 Yeah.

00:48:39.160 --> 00:48:41.720
 It was like pinching it and pulling it and like just generally trying to get it to let

00:48:41.720 --> 00:48:42.720
 go.

00:48:42.720 --> 00:48:46.040
 And then you've got to persuade it to cling on to the new one as well.

00:48:46.040 --> 00:48:47.040
 Oh my God.

00:48:47.040 --> 00:48:48.040
 It just doesn't want to move.

00:48:48.040 --> 00:48:49.040
 Yeah.

00:48:49.040 --> 00:48:50.040
 The anemone, I don't know if it knows.

00:48:50.040 --> 00:48:51.660
 But basically just, I don't know.

00:48:51.660 --> 00:48:52.660
 But it's just not cooperating.

00:48:52.660 --> 00:48:53.660
 It just clings on, right?

00:48:53.660 --> 00:48:54.660
 It just clings on.

00:48:54.660 --> 00:48:59.780
 But the crab is like, well, they might not get another anemone and they're in short supply.

00:48:59.780 --> 00:49:01.060
 So you have to bring them with you.

00:49:01.060 --> 00:49:02.060
 Wow.

00:49:02.060 --> 00:49:03.060
 So great.

00:49:03.060 --> 00:49:04.060
 Yeah.

00:49:04.060 --> 00:49:05.060
 That's really amazing.

00:49:05.060 --> 00:49:06.060
 It's like the worst blue tack ever when you're moving out of a house.

00:49:06.060 --> 00:49:07.060
 It's scraping away.

00:49:07.060 --> 00:49:08.060
 Two days.

00:49:08.060 --> 00:49:09.060
 Yeah.

00:49:09.060 --> 00:49:10.060
 Why don't I put that poster up?

00:49:10.060 --> 00:49:11.940
 Have you heard of Aki Inomata?

00:49:11.940 --> 00:49:12.940
 She's a Japanese artist.

00:49:12.940 --> 00:49:13.940
 No.

00:49:13.940 --> 00:49:14.940
 I don't think so.

00:49:14.940 --> 00:49:20.800
 She does collaborations with animals and one of the animals that she's done an art project

00:49:20.800 --> 00:49:22.900
 with is a hermit crab.

00:49:22.900 --> 00:49:23.900
 Okay.

00:49:23.900 --> 00:49:27.900
 So she's 3D printed miniature cities.

00:49:27.900 --> 00:49:28.900
 Oh yeah.

00:49:28.900 --> 00:49:29.900
 Hi CDs.

00:49:29.900 --> 00:49:35.760
 And she puts the miniature city sort of model she's built on top of a shell and then lets

00:49:35.760 --> 00:49:37.320
 her hermit crab move into that.

00:49:37.320 --> 00:49:38.320
 It is cool.

00:49:38.320 --> 00:49:41.160
 I mean, I guess it's also not a natural shell, which would be the best thing.

00:49:41.160 --> 00:49:43.220
 But it's an interesting, you know.

00:49:43.220 --> 00:49:44.220
 They won't move into anything.

00:49:44.220 --> 00:49:48.620
 Like you give them like make them little Lego homes, they'll move it, they'll try that.

00:49:48.620 --> 00:49:51.900
 And I looked a bit more into her work Inomata.

00:49:51.900 --> 00:49:55.880
 She's done another project, which is called I wear the dog's hair and the dog wears my

00:49:55.880 --> 00:49:56.880
 hair.

00:49:56.880 --> 00:49:57.880
 Okay.

00:49:57.880 --> 00:50:00.880
 And she and her dog wore capes made from each other's hair.

00:50:00.880 --> 00:50:01.880
 Okay.

00:50:01.880 --> 00:50:03.700
 And it looks a lot nicer than you would think it would look.

00:50:03.700 --> 00:50:04.700
 When you say collaboration.

00:50:04.700 --> 00:50:07.700
 It was the dog's idea.

00:50:07.700 --> 00:50:14.140
 She said, I collected the hair of a dog called Ciello and my own hair over a number of years

00:50:14.140 --> 00:50:17.300
 and then make clothes out of my hair for the dog and the dog's hair for myself so we can

00:50:17.300 --> 00:50:18.300
 exchange coats.

00:50:18.300 --> 00:50:21.700
 The two species, human beings and dogs have developed together over the ages.

00:50:21.700 --> 00:50:24.720
 This work examines the relationship between a human and her pet.

00:50:24.720 --> 00:50:25.720
 Okay.

00:50:25.720 --> 00:50:26.720
 What kind of dog was it?

00:50:26.720 --> 00:50:28.320
 I just want to know what kind of patterning it had.

00:50:28.320 --> 00:50:29.320
 Small dog.

00:50:29.320 --> 00:50:30.320
 Oh, wow.

00:50:30.320 --> 00:50:31.320
 Was it spotty or stropey or?

00:50:31.320 --> 00:50:32.320
 Just brown, I think.

00:50:32.320 --> 00:50:34.340
 I'm just wondering if it's a small dog.

00:50:34.340 --> 00:50:36.140
 What kind of outfit you can make really?

00:50:36.140 --> 00:50:37.840
 It's wearing quite a natty little waistcoat.

00:50:37.840 --> 00:50:38.840
 It looks good.

00:50:38.840 --> 00:50:39.840
 Nice.

00:50:39.840 --> 00:50:42.880
 And she's wearing a kind of cool sleeveless jacket thing.

00:50:42.880 --> 00:50:45.420
 So the dog's waistcoat is made out of her hair.

00:50:45.420 --> 00:50:46.420
 That's right.

00:50:46.420 --> 00:50:48.460
 So why don't we make more clothes out of human hair?

00:50:48.460 --> 00:50:49.460
 Yeah, Andy.

00:50:49.460 --> 00:50:50.460
 That's a good question.

00:50:50.460 --> 00:50:51.460
 Oh, I don't know.

00:50:51.460 --> 00:50:52.460
 Let's do it.

00:50:52.460 --> 00:50:53.460
 Well, one creepy, I would say.

00:50:53.460 --> 00:50:54.460
 Yeah.

00:50:54.460 --> 00:50:57.740
 But I mean, you get a lot of, I mean, I guess they use, like, when you get your haircut,

00:50:57.740 --> 00:51:01.300
 like, if it's good hair, they'll use it for making wigs and that's a good wigs.

00:51:01.300 --> 00:51:02.300
 That's good.

00:51:02.300 --> 00:51:03.300
 Well, that's true.

00:51:03.300 --> 00:51:04.300
 Maybe we do that instead.

00:51:04.300 --> 00:51:05.300
 I don't know.

00:51:05.300 --> 00:51:06.300
 I just wondered.

00:51:06.300 --> 00:51:07.300
 Probably.

00:51:07.300 --> 00:51:08.300
 I mean, this woman's a very good artist, it sounds like.

00:51:08.300 --> 00:51:11.020
 And probably most people who try to make clothes out of human hair would look like shit.

00:51:11.020 --> 00:51:12.020
 Yeah.

00:51:12.020 --> 00:51:18.020
 But if you think of all the head and shoulders you have to put in the washing machine, do

00:51:18.020 --> 00:51:22.420
 you guys know about, I really love historical manias, and I think we often cover them on

00:51:22.420 --> 00:51:23.420
 the show.

00:51:23.420 --> 00:51:27.660
 And I don't think we've talked about conchillomania or conchillomania.

00:51:27.660 --> 00:51:31.700
 In the 18th century, people just got really obsessed with collecting shells, didn't they?

00:51:31.700 --> 00:51:32.700
 I really did.

00:51:32.700 --> 00:51:36.020
 And it sounds like a really fun time to be alive and the.

00:51:36.020 --> 00:51:40.180
 Ponds, you'll die at 40.

00:51:40.180 --> 00:51:41.180
 Pros.

00:51:41.180 --> 00:51:43.580
 Lovely shell collections of conchillomania.

00:51:43.580 --> 00:51:44.580
 Yeah.

00:51:44.580 --> 00:51:45.580
 Worth it.

00:51:45.580 --> 00:51:49.740
 So, I suppose, like, a lot of these manias, it's a time when people in the Western world

00:51:49.740 --> 00:51:53.020
 or in Europe are exploring more, so they're finding more exciting shells around the world.

00:51:53.020 --> 00:51:55.500
 The most valued was this one called Glory of the Sea.

00:51:55.500 --> 00:51:57.220
 Have you seen a Glory of the Sea show?

00:51:57.220 --> 00:51:58.220
 I have.

00:51:58.220 --> 00:51:59.220
 Yes.

00:51:59.220 --> 00:52:00.220
 They're not that impressive, are they?

00:52:00.220 --> 00:52:01.220
 Well, no, you're right.

00:52:01.220 --> 00:52:04.540
 I've seen one that was like, was from that time, and it was collected by Victoria Collectors

00:52:04.540 --> 00:52:05.540
 in the Natural History Museum.

00:52:05.540 --> 00:52:06.540
 Oh, cool.

00:52:06.540 --> 00:52:07.540
 Come back.

00:52:07.540 --> 00:52:13.220
 But, yeah, it's because no one had one, and so, therefore, you know, the few that existed.

00:52:13.220 --> 00:52:17.180
 Is that the one where there's a story about someone buying another one?

00:52:17.180 --> 00:52:22.700
 He had one already, bought another one at auction, and then immediately smashed it to pieces.

00:52:22.700 --> 00:52:24.420
 In order to up the value of the first one.

00:52:24.420 --> 00:52:25.420
 Yeah, I've heard that story.

00:52:25.420 --> 00:52:26.420
 And that might just be aproposal.

00:52:26.420 --> 00:52:28.420
 I don't know if it's true, but it's that kind of level of me.

00:52:28.420 --> 00:52:29.420
 It was that vibe.

00:52:29.420 --> 00:52:30.420
 Yeah, yeah.

00:52:30.420 --> 00:52:34.580
 There's definitely one that's sold for three times more than a Vermeer painting at the

00:52:34.580 --> 00:52:36.380
 same auction.

00:52:36.380 --> 00:52:40.740
 And then there was this awful moment where we slightly got over the shell collecting

00:52:40.740 --> 00:52:43.740
 obsession by the 20th century, but they were still really valuable.

00:52:43.740 --> 00:52:50.220
 And I think in 1966, there were only 41 known specimens in the world.

00:52:50.220 --> 00:52:56.380
 And then in 1969, we just found this habitat in New Guinea where they all live, and now

00:52:56.380 --> 00:52:57.380
 there are tons of them.

00:52:57.380 --> 00:52:58.820
 Scuba divers found them, didn't they?

00:52:58.820 --> 00:52:59.820
 Yeah.

00:52:59.820 --> 00:53:00.820
 I think, yeah.

00:53:00.820 --> 00:53:03.500
 And there's probably not so many left for hermit crabs now.

00:53:03.500 --> 00:53:04.500
 No, that's true.

00:53:04.500 --> 00:53:06.980
 Actually, I don't know if they're good for hermit crabs.

00:53:06.980 --> 00:53:08.540
 They've got quite small openings.

00:53:08.540 --> 00:53:09.540
 They are very petite.

00:53:09.540 --> 00:53:10.540
 It would have to.

00:53:10.540 --> 00:53:11.940
 It was the very lower end of the housing market, I think.

00:53:11.940 --> 00:53:12.940
 Yeah.

00:53:12.940 --> 00:53:13.940
 That's the first time.

00:53:13.940 --> 00:53:14.940
 Yeah.

00:53:14.940 --> 00:53:15.940
 You've written a whole book about shells.

00:53:15.940 --> 00:53:16.940
 I have.

00:53:16.940 --> 00:53:17.940
 Spirals in Time.

00:53:17.940 --> 00:53:18.940
 That's correct.

00:53:18.940 --> 00:53:19.940
 Such a great title.

00:53:19.940 --> 00:53:20.940
 Thank you.

00:53:20.940 --> 00:53:21.940
 Can I ask you, Helen, about periostracum?

00:53:21.940 --> 00:53:22.940
 Oh.

00:53:22.940 --> 00:53:24.140
 I might be saying it wrong.

00:53:24.140 --> 00:53:28.060
 I say periostracum, but you know, I'm making that up as well.

00:53:28.060 --> 00:53:31.620
 You're an actual expert in this field, so I'm going to go with what you're saying.

00:53:31.620 --> 00:53:33.620
 Is it true that shells, this is like a skin?

00:53:33.620 --> 00:53:34.620
 Yes.

00:53:34.620 --> 00:53:35.620
 Shells have skin in life.

00:53:35.620 --> 00:53:36.620
 Some do.

00:53:36.620 --> 00:53:37.620
 Yeah.

00:53:37.620 --> 00:53:39.340
 So it's like a hairy layer that grows on the outside.

00:53:39.340 --> 00:53:43.540
 I think it's like a probably camouflage, probably some sort of protective thing that

00:53:43.540 --> 00:53:47.580
 makes them look less like a shell and more like a bit of weedy rock.

00:53:47.580 --> 00:53:48.580
 Yeah.

00:53:48.580 --> 00:53:49.580
 Yeah.

00:53:49.580 --> 00:53:53.260
 All the shells that we see, well, no, like lots of them will have had skin.

00:53:53.260 --> 00:53:54.260
 That's weird, isn't it?

00:53:54.260 --> 00:53:55.260
 Yeah.

00:53:55.260 --> 00:53:56.260
 Isn't that weird?

00:53:56.260 --> 00:53:57.260
 I find it a bit weird.

00:53:57.260 --> 00:53:58.260
 It's quite weird.

00:53:58.260 --> 00:53:59.260
 Yeah.

00:53:59.260 --> 00:54:00.260
 And then the thing is like cowries, which are really shiny.

00:54:00.260 --> 00:54:02.660
 They seem like big, lovely, shiny cowrie shells.

00:54:02.660 --> 00:54:05.140
 The reason they're shiny is because part of their body called the mantle, which is like

00:54:05.140 --> 00:54:07.340
 the pink bit on a muscle when you eat muscles.

00:54:07.340 --> 00:54:08.340
 That's the mantle.

00:54:08.340 --> 00:54:11.140
 Anyway, it falls over the outside when they're alive, so they cover themselves in like a

00:54:11.140 --> 00:54:15.340
 part of their body, which means they stay nice and shiny and they don't have like stuff

00:54:15.340 --> 00:54:16.340
 growing on them.

00:54:16.340 --> 00:54:21.140
 That's why they are so like porcelain-y kind of shiny glassy.

00:54:21.140 --> 00:54:24.620
 Is it porcelain or is the Italian for cowrie shell, I think?

00:54:24.620 --> 00:54:25.620
 Oh, is it?

00:54:25.620 --> 00:54:26.620
 Yeah.

00:54:26.620 --> 00:54:27.620
 Cool.

00:54:27.620 --> 00:54:28.620
 There you go.

00:54:28.620 --> 00:54:29.620
 Yeah.

00:54:29.620 --> 00:54:32.460
 It was named after the cowrie shell, I think.

00:54:32.460 --> 00:54:33.860
 Ooh, that's cool.

00:54:33.860 --> 00:54:40.460
 And the cowrie shell was named porcelain-er because it reminded people of a pig's vagina.

00:54:40.460 --> 00:54:43.860
 Yeah, cowrie's got a lot of that sort of stuff going on.

00:54:43.860 --> 00:54:45.860
 You can't see that when you picture a cowrie shell.

00:54:45.860 --> 00:54:46.860
 I mean, yeah.

00:54:46.860 --> 00:54:47.860
 I can see it.

00:54:47.860 --> 00:54:48.860
 First thing that springs to mind.

00:54:48.860 --> 00:54:53.420
 If you've only ever seen a cowrie shell or a pig's vagina, basically you've seen them

00:54:53.420 --> 00:54:54.420
 both.

00:54:54.420 --> 00:54:55.420
 I think that's correct.

00:54:55.420 --> 00:54:56.420
 Yeah, I would say.

00:54:56.420 --> 00:54:57.420
 For people at home.

00:54:57.420 --> 00:55:02.020
 It's true, Helen, that we don't really know how shells form when animals grow their own

00:55:02.020 --> 00:55:03.020
 shells.

00:55:03.020 --> 00:55:07.620
 The process of biomineralization, I mean, it's a bit of a mystery.

00:55:07.620 --> 00:55:10.100
 It's still a bit of a mystery because it's one of those things that takes a very long

00:55:10.100 --> 00:55:11.100
 time.

00:55:11.100 --> 00:55:12.100
 I think there's a lot going on.

00:55:12.100 --> 00:55:15.420
 There's like a protein scaffold that gets laid down first, I think, and then the calcium

00:55:15.420 --> 00:55:18.980
 carbonate, which is the hard stuff, gets laid down in that.

00:55:18.980 --> 00:55:20.780
 And it's all at the outer edge of it.

00:55:20.780 --> 00:55:26.700
 They harvest the calcium ions and carbonate ions from seawater and then combine the two

00:55:26.700 --> 00:55:30.300
 of them together and they make crystals of calcium carbonate, which then go on this

00:55:30.300 --> 00:55:31.300
 scaffold.

00:55:31.300 --> 00:55:32.300
 Right.

00:55:32.300 --> 00:55:34.060
 It sounds like we do know how it's made.

00:55:34.060 --> 00:55:35.060
 Yeah.

00:55:35.060 --> 00:55:36.060
 Okay, but again.

00:55:36.060 --> 00:55:37.060
 I mean, that's a broad brush.

00:55:37.060 --> 00:55:38.060
 We know what happens.

00:55:38.060 --> 00:55:39.060
 But how?

00:55:39.060 --> 00:55:40.060
 And also why?

00:55:40.060 --> 00:55:41.060
 Yeah, exactly.

00:55:41.060 --> 00:55:42.060
 And then it can be.

00:55:42.060 --> 00:55:46.060
 But I just think that's insane that they can harvest.

00:55:46.060 --> 00:55:48.140
 But they don't know that they're doing it.

00:55:48.140 --> 00:55:49.140
 It's not on their chemist.

00:55:49.140 --> 00:55:50.140
 It doesn't make it less impressive.

00:55:50.140 --> 00:55:55.140
 Well, it does make it a bit less impressive, but I do think it's just amazing.

00:55:55.140 --> 00:55:56.380
 It's really cool.

00:55:56.380 --> 00:56:01.100
 The world's most exclusive textile is made from a bivalve and I'd never heard of this.

00:56:01.100 --> 00:56:02.780
 Have you seen this?

00:56:02.780 --> 00:56:04.140
 It's made from the pen shell.

00:56:04.140 --> 00:56:06.580
 So a bivalve is like a mussel, right?

00:56:06.580 --> 00:56:07.580
 Or a snappy shell.

00:56:07.580 --> 00:56:08.580
 Yeah, I think with two shells.

00:56:08.580 --> 00:56:09.580
 A snappy shell.

00:56:09.580 --> 00:56:10.580
 A pack man.

00:56:10.580 --> 00:56:11.580
 A pack man.

00:56:11.580 --> 00:56:12.580
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:56:12.580 --> 00:56:17.460
 There are only 60 items known to be made of this special silk from this special pen shell.

00:56:17.460 --> 00:56:20.820
 And so you've seen one of these things and basically they're huge, aren't they?

00:56:20.820 --> 00:56:21.820
 The shells?

00:56:21.820 --> 00:56:22.820
 They're like a metre tall.

00:56:22.820 --> 00:56:23.820
 Yeah, I mean, they used to be.

00:56:23.820 --> 00:56:24.820
 Now they're not.

00:56:24.820 --> 00:56:25.820
 They're doing quite badly now and there's not as big.

00:56:25.820 --> 00:56:26.820
 Yeah, they can.

00:56:26.820 --> 00:56:27.820
 It's basically like a beard.

00:56:27.820 --> 00:56:32.260
 Oh, like when you have mussels, if you eat moulmagne and you pull off the mossy beardy

00:56:32.260 --> 00:56:33.260
 bits, the same stuff.

00:56:33.260 --> 00:56:34.260
 The threads.

00:56:34.260 --> 00:56:35.260
 The threads, exactly.

00:56:35.260 --> 00:56:38.860
 And then you use this hair to embed ourselves in the seed bed, right, that little root.

00:56:38.860 --> 00:56:41.220
 And then you make this amazing silk out of it.

00:56:41.220 --> 00:56:42.220
 Yeah, you go through it.

00:56:42.220 --> 00:56:43.380
 It goes through stages of processing.

00:56:43.380 --> 00:56:46.940
 I went to Sardinia, which is really where the only people left who do it.

00:56:46.940 --> 00:56:47.940
 What?

00:56:47.940 --> 00:56:48.940
 And I saw them going through.

00:56:48.940 --> 00:56:49.940
 In fact, I think there's one woman left I read.

00:56:49.940 --> 00:56:50.940
 Did you meet one?

00:56:50.940 --> 00:56:51.940
 Yeah.

00:56:51.940 --> 00:56:52.940
 I met that one woman.

00:56:52.940 --> 00:56:53.940
 Oh.

00:56:53.940 --> 00:56:54.940
 Chiara Vigo.

00:56:54.940 --> 00:56:57.220
 I don't know if I should be mean.

00:56:57.220 --> 00:57:02.420
 No, I'm not going to be mean, but she claims to be the last living mistress of sea silk,

00:57:02.420 --> 00:57:03.580
 as it's called.

00:57:03.580 --> 00:57:06.420
 But I met several other people who do it.

00:57:06.420 --> 00:57:09.440
 And this is explosive news to me and probably no one else.

00:57:09.440 --> 00:57:12.540
 No, and it's all in the book.

00:57:12.540 --> 00:57:13.540
 It's inspires and time.

00:57:13.540 --> 00:57:14.540
 I talk about it.

00:57:14.540 --> 00:57:19.140
 I met her and she's kind of all like very woo-woo about it and she can go into her little

00:57:19.140 --> 00:57:22.700
 workshop and she does all this kind of, oh, and here it is, and I do all these things.

00:57:22.700 --> 00:57:27.180
 But then, yeah, I met two other women who've learned it from there because it's handed.

00:57:27.180 --> 00:57:30.020
 No one does it because you're not allowed to harvest these things anymore, but from

00:57:30.020 --> 00:57:34.100
 the fact they're not doing very well because they've just been wiped out by disease, pen

00:57:34.100 --> 00:57:37.420
 shells are now protected, so you can't go and take one to get there.

00:57:37.420 --> 00:57:39.140
 So did you call the police on this one?

00:57:39.140 --> 00:57:43.500
 Well, no, because she claims that she can sustainably harvest them, but no one's allowed

00:57:43.500 --> 00:57:44.500
 to watch her do it.

00:57:44.500 --> 00:57:45.740
 That was the part where I was like, oh, okay.

00:57:45.740 --> 00:57:48.500
 Yes, because she says she doesn't harm the shell, no she doesn't harm you.

00:57:48.500 --> 00:57:52.180
 She's like, no, no, they're fine, they grow back and I'm like, they do grow back, but

00:57:52.180 --> 00:57:56.020
 I don't know how fast and if it's fast enough and she doesn't let anyone watch her while

00:57:56.020 --> 00:57:57.020
 she's doing it.

00:57:57.020 --> 00:57:58.020
 Oh, interesting.

00:57:58.020 --> 00:58:03.180
 I will keep the pig alive while I make this bacon sandwich, but I must do it in a closed

00:58:03.180 --> 00:58:04.180
 room and you can't come in.

00:58:04.180 --> 00:58:05.780
 You might hear some squealing, that's me.

00:58:05.780 --> 00:58:15.660
 I just love bacon so much.

00:58:15.660 --> 00:58:16.660
 Okay, that's it.

00:58:16.660 --> 00:58:17.660
 That's all of our facts.

00:58:17.660 --> 00:58:20.220

00:59:03.420 --> 00:59:04.420
 places.

00:59:04.420 --> 00:59:08.380
 Way more important than that is please, buy all of Helen's books.

00:59:08.380 --> 00:59:12.860
 They're amazing, but definitely buy the latest book, which is...

00:59:12.860 --> 00:59:14.940
 What the Wild Sea can be.

00:59:14.940 --> 00:59:17.860
 It's such a romantic title, I love it.

00:59:17.860 --> 00:59:18.860
 Do you like it?

00:59:18.860 --> 00:59:19.860
 I came up with it first.

00:59:19.860 --> 00:59:21.340
 Normally the title comes last.

00:59:21.340 --> 00:59:23.660
 Sparrow's in Time was particularly painful.

00:59:23.660 --> 00:59:24.660
 That was last minute.

00:59:24.660 --> 00:59:25.660
 But this one I came up first.

00:59:25.660 --> 00:59:26.660
 Yeah.

00:59:26.660 --> 00:59:27.660
 All the Wild Sea can be.

00:59:27.660 --> 00:59:28.660
 But it has optimism in it, doesn't it?

00:59:28.660 --> 00:59:29.660
 Oh, definitely.

00:59:29.660 --> 00:59:30.660
 Yeah, that's kind of the point.

00:59:30.660 --> 00:59:33.540
 It's like let's not give up and there's lots of things that's hopeful and hopefully there's

00:59:33.540 --> 00:59:34.740
 some fun things in there too.

00:59:34.740 --> 00:59:38.420
 So do that and come back again next week to catch us again.

00:59:38.420 --> 00:59:39.420
 We will see you then.

00:59:39.420 --> 00:59:40.420
 Goodbye.

00:59:40.420 --> 00:59:47.740
 I've never heard of that, I've got to look it up when I go.

00:59:47.740 --> 00:59:48.740
 It's fucking good.

00:59:48.740 --> 00:59:52.060
 It genuinely works.

00:59:52.060 --> 00:59:53.060
 What temperature?

00:59:53.060 --> 00:59:54.060
 Because that's the other thing.

00:59:54.060 --> 00:59:55.060
 Oh yeah, 150 Celsius.

00:59:55.060 --> 00:59:56.060
 Okay.

00:59:56.060 --> 00:59:57.060
 For three hours.

00:59:57.060 --> 00:59:58.060
 No, fine, fine.

00:59:58.060 --> 00:59:59.060
 Good, good, good.

00:59:59.060 --> 01:00:00.060
 Just checking.

01:00:00.060 --> 01:00:10.060

01:00:10.060 --> 01:00:11.060
