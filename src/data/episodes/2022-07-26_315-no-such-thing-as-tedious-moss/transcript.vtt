00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.680
 Hi everyone, James here. Now, before we start this week's show, which is another

00:00:03.680 --> 00:00:09.200
 working from home episode, where we recorded in all of our different homes around the country.

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:13.840
 I just want to say I hope everyone's all right. I hope that you're all staying indoors. I hope

00:00:13.840 --> 00:00:18.640
 you're all looking after your family and friends. But there's just one little bit of news that I

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:24.480
 wanted to say, which we mentioned last week, but that is that we have re-released the second year

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:29.200
 of No Such Things A Fish for free on the internet. So, if you go to the place where you normally

00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:35.520
 get your podcasts, you will see episodes 53 to 104 and they were not there in the past. So,

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:40.720
 there's hours and hours of fun on there. I hope you enjoy them. But one more thing about that is

00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:45.760
 if you would like something a little bit extra, then you can go to No Such Things A Fish.com

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:51.840
 and you can find the details of our audio cassette. Now, this is not any normal audio cassette.

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:58.160
 You can't put it in your cassette player if you still have one. It is a USB. That USB has all of

00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:04.400
 those episodes, like I said, which are now up for free. But it also has an exclusive show that we filmed

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:10.320
 live in the QI offices, so you can see exactly what our office is like. And, I mean, apart from that,

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:14.560
 it's a really beautiful little cassette, which is really an awesome thing to have on your shelf and

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:21.520
 your house. So, enjoy the show. Hope everything's good. Get the cassette, if you fancy it. We'll see you

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:39.920
 all on the other side. Okay, on with the podcast.

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:46.400
 Hello and welcome to another work from home episode of No Such Things A Fish A Weekly Podcast.

00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:51.760
 My name is Dan Schreiber. I am sitting here with Anna Chazinski, Andrew Hunter Murray and James

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:56.320
 Harkin. And once again, we have gathered around our microphones with our four favorite facts from

00:01:56.320 --> 00:02:02.720
 the last seven days. And in no particular order, here we go. Starting with fact number one,

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:10.400
 that's my fact. My fact is NASA fixed its Mars probe by getting it to whack itself with a shovel.

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:16.480
 Did NASA send a shovel with the probe, just in case it needed something to whack itself with,

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:22.480
 like in a cartoon? And did NASA once they had it hitting itself with a shovel? Did it go? Stop

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:30.640
 hitting yourself mate. Stop hitting yourself. So, whack is, as James pointed out to me in an email,

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:36.720
 not the correct term. Technically, it was a little push. It was a little shove, but it's been reported

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:41.520
 as a whack by most of the media. I wouldn't call it a shove. It was a gentle caress.

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:47.440
 Yes. NASA fixed its Mars probe by gently caressing it with a shovel. Stop caressing yourself.

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:56.480
 No, really, stop it. We can see the video. Oh, shit. Okay. Sorry. I'll put that away.

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:06.880
 So, yeah. So, this is the Mars probe that landed late 2018. It was in November, and it's the Mars

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:11.760
 Insight mission. And the idea is that it's going deep into the interior of Mars, which has never

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:15.840
 been done before. All previous missions have just looked at the landscape, taken bits of soil.

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:20.720
 This one's drilling down to tell us about the planet. As NASA actually puts it on its own website,

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:25.520
 it's the first mission to give Mars a thorough checkup since the planet formed 4.5 billion years

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:31.040
 ago. So, it's a beautiful little thing that they're trying to test out here. And as they were using

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:36.160
 the machine that was drilling down, the drill itself, which is called the mole, suddenly got stuck,

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:40.960
 and they couldn't work out why. And this happened in March of last year. And so, for whole year,

00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:45.600
 they've desperately been trying to work out how we can get this shovel to work again,

00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:50.320
 because it's only gone something like 35 centimeters into the ground when it's meant to go

00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:56.080
 a full three to five meters roughly. So, they have no idea what to do, and they've been thinking

00:03:56.080 --> 00:04:00.480
 a whole year they've had labs set up where they've tested every scenario of what they could do.

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:07.040
 And the answer, finally, that came to them, is just give it a little caress. And it might work

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:11.920
 and it has. So, it's working again. Yeah, initially, they tried to caress it on the side, didn't they?

00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:17.200
 Because they tried to move it to the side of the hole, which it was drilling. And that might give

00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:21.680
 it a bit more purchase. But then they decided they're going to have to push down on it. And the problem

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:28.160
 is that there is a massive tether. So, the mole is attached to the main probe with a piece of wire.

00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:32.960
 And what they didn't want to do was push that and then damage the tether and then not be able to do

00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:37.840
 anything with it. Because if you damage that, then there's no mulling, there's no nothing. And it's

00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:44.240
 also, it's not a drill. It's kind of a drill would spin round, right? Wait, James, did you just say

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:52.400
 this is not a drill? This is not a drill. So, a drill would spin round. But there's nothing for

00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:57.680
 it to grab onto. So, you can't kind of spin round like a drill. It's kind of an up and down thing.

00:04:57.680 --> 00:05:02.800
 So, it kind of pulls itself up and then slams itself down and hopefully makes it a little bit in.

00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:06.160
 And then it keeps doing that again and again and again and again and hopefully gets about three or

00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:11.920
 four metres in there. Do you guys know why it's called insights? Because they are citing the inside

00:05:11.920 --> 00:05:18.800
 of Mars. I think, well, it's a clever double play on words. So, NASA is just full of these stupid

00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:22.800
 acronyms where it obviously gives stuff a name and then thinks, well, we better attribute,

00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:26.800
 you know, something to each of those initials. So, it's called insights. It stands for

00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:32.640
 interior exploration using seismic investigations, geodesy and heat transport. And it actually had to

00:05:32.640 --> 00:05:38.720
 have a name change. So, it used to be slightly more catchy than that. It was originally called the

00:05:38.720 --> 00:05:44.640
 Geophysical Monitoring Station, which was Gens, but NASA suddenly went, oh, go, we've already got one

00:05:44.640 --> 00:05:50.480
 of those in the working. So, they had to change its whole name so that it didn't coincide with another one.

00:05:50.480 --> 00:05:57.440
 Do you know the insiders won an Emmy? That's it. No, before. It won an Emmy for Outstanding

00:05:57.440 --> 00:06:04.880
 Original Interactive Program. So, NASA did some coverage of this landing and of its drilling and

00:06:04.880 --> 00:06:10.240
 shuffling and all that kind of stuff. And you could go online and you could interact with the show.

00:06:10.240 --> 00:06:16.320
 And it won an Emmy for it. It was a bad year for TV that year, wasn't it? It wasn't that year, yeah.

00:06:16.320 --> 00:06:22.320
 And one other thing about insight, and do you know that they have named a rock on Mars?

00:06:22.320 --> 00:06:30.160
 Oh, okay. So, when it landed, when the insight landed, it kind of knocked a little rock. It's only

00:06:30.160 --> 00:06:35.520
 about the size of a golf ball, and it rolled about three feet away. And do you know what they named this rock?

00:06:35.520 --> 00:06:44.160
 Okay. They named it after a famous thing. A famous thing. Did they name it after a rock star?

00:06:44.160 --> 00:06:52.080
 After some famous people. Oh, the Rolling Stones. Correct. Because it was a Rolling Stone.

00:06:52.080 --> 00:06:58.400
 Wow. They've named this one tiny rock of Mars, which is about the size of a golf ball. They've named

00:06:58.400 --> 00:07:03.040
 it after the Rolling Stones. It's almost more of an insult naming that after the Rolling Stones.

00:07:03.040 --> 00:07:08.320
 It really is. It's not like naming a star or a, you know, a moon or something, is it? And it's named

00:07:08.320 --> 00:07:13.440
 after all the Rolling Stones. They haven't picked one. That one rock is now just the full band.

00:07:13.440 --> 00:07:18.400
 It's called the Rolling Stones Rock. Right. Although they could have called it the Rolling Rock

00:07:18.400 --> 00:07:22.400
 or the Rolling Stone, because that's effectively what it is. Yeah. But they've just decided

00:07:22.400 --> 00:07:26.960
 Rolling Stones Rock. Did they observe whether the Rolling Stone has gathered any moss?

00:07:27.920 --> 00:07:33.520
 Well, we might come to moss later in this show. Oh, it's boilers, boilers.

00:07:33.520 --> 00:07:40.000
 Just this was a very, very low-tech solution that they use. The Wacker, Spade, Shovel,

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:43.520
 Moll thing. It's Wacker Molls. They just call it Wacker Moll. We've already got to pay

00:07:43.520 --> 00:07:49.040
 caress a Moll, Anna. Sorry. That's a very different game.

00:07:49.040 --> 00:07:56.720
 Anyway, this was a very low-tech solution. So there was another one I found during the Apollo 11

00:07:56.720 --> 00:08:03.200
 mission. And this was when they'd all got back on the lunar module and they hadn't yet pressed the

00:08:03.200 --> 00:08:09.520
 button to say take us back to Earth. And Armstrong was wearing his backpack on the module. And it smashed

00:08:09.520 --> 00:08:14.880
 into the switch. There was one switch they needed to turn on the engine and begin the flight back to earth.

00:08:14.880 --> 00:08:19.040
 And he was wearing his big, clunky space backpack. And it just broke the whole switch off.

00:08:19.040 --> 00:08:25.520
 Like, it was fine because they just shoved a felt-tipped pen that Buzz Aldrin had been using. Don't

00:08:25.520 --> 00:08:32.400
 know why he had a felt-tipped pen on the Apollo 11. But you do. If you watch the moon footage when

00:08:32.400 --> 00:08:39.920
 Neil Armstrong turns round, it says dickhead on his back. That's what that was for. He still keeps

00:08:39.920 --> 00:08:44.080
 that pen on him to this day, Buzz Aldrin. He stops. Yeah, he takes it everywhere. He goes, yeah,

00:08:44.080 --> 00:08:49.840
 it's still working. Yeah, it's still got ink. It's still... In many ways, there's more impressive

00:08:49.840 --> 00:08:56.240
 than the Moon lab things. I don't suppose he still uses it. No, he carries it as his lucky charm.

00:08:56.240 --> 00:09:01.600
 It was the thing that got them off the moon. Because when we met him, Dan, you did have the word dickhead

00:09:01.600 --> 00:09:07.360
 on your back, but that wasn't him who wrote it. No, I'm still trying to find who did that. It's got

00:09:07.360 --> 00:09:11.920
 similar handwriting to you, James, but I don't want to make any accusations. There's interesting,

00:09:11.920 --> 00:09:17.200
 there's a... I found a fun term for the idea of whacking something to make it work again, which is

00:09:17.200 --> 00:09:24.080
 percussive maintenance. It's a thing that actually is recommended by so many different people,

00:09:24.080 --> 00:09:29.360
 people who work in the electronics industry. There was a whole thing about the fact that if a

00:09:29.360 --> 00:09:34.480
 soldiered connection needed to reconnect, sometimes it would lose its connection. Just by whacking it,

00:09:34.480 --> 00:09:40.000
 you could make it reconnect. There's been so many examples of percussive maintenance throughout

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:46.080
 the years in NASA Territory Skylab when that went up. There was a bit of a problem on the outside

00:09:46.080 --> 00:09:50.640
 of it and the way that the astronauts fixed that was during a spacewalk was to hit it and that made

00:09:50.640 --> 00:09:56.560
 it work again, so that was very useful. But then there was also this great airplane called the Blackbird,

00:09:56.560 --> 00:10:03.520
 the SR-71 Blackbird. Have you guys heard of this? This is a bird. Sorry, this is a plane. No, it's

00:10:03.520 --> 00:10:12.080
 Superman. So this is a plane that flew so high and fast that when it was up there, the body of

00:10:12.080 --> 00:10:22.320
 the plane would stretch because of the materials would stretch. Absolutely. Can I just repeat what you

00:10:22.320 --> 00:10:28.720
 just said? You said so it went so fast that the body would stretch because the body would stretch.

00:10:28.720 --> 00:10:34.160
 I didn't expect for this to get picked up. I don't know where to go from here. That was not an

00:10:34.160 --> 00:10:39.120
 acceptable explanation. Dan, is it the case that the pilots will be sitting at the controls and

00:10:39.120 --> 00:10:44.560
 then suddenly they go, "Whoa!" And then they'll be sitting at the third row. Is it the people who are on

00:10:44.560 --> 00:10:50.880
 the plane are going, "I've got a lot more legroom than I used to." Well, I thought that was a

00:10:50.880 --> 00:10:56.080
 thing with planes that when you go to a certain altitude, materials, construction, shrink, I thought

00:10:56.080 --> 00:11:01.200
 that was a classic thing. You've got to collect more information on it in order to elucidate it for

00:11:01.200 --> 00:11:07.600
 the rest of us who don't know about it. Well, let's imagine that let's just accept that this

00:11:07.600 --> 00:11:12.880
 grew a trunk. No, we're not accepting it. Okay. Well, I'm ready to accept it. Come on. Let's accept

00:11:12.880 --> 00:11:17.680
 that this thing is stretched, like, stretch Armstrong. So the idea was that they built a plane

00:11:17.680 --> 00:11:22.400
 whereby the panels didn't necessarily meet on the ground. There was a gap between them so that when

00:11:22.400 --> 00:11:26.480
 it got to that height and it stretched, they would lock into each other and then it could continue

00:11:26.480 --> 00:11:32.080
 flying in perfect harmony at that height. When it landed back on the ground, they would then

00:11:32.080 --> 00:11:37.360
 bash it back into shape of making those gaps again for the next flight. Hang on, I'm a bit

00:11:37.360 --> 00:11:43.520
 confused now about how if the panels didn't meet on the ground, and then it stretched apart. It's a good,

00:11:43.520 --> 00:11:49.120
 I know what you're going to say, yeah, it's a good question. Are you sure it didn't squash? It feels like,

00:11:49.120 --> 00:11:54.320
 because it would be so cold up there, because it's a lot colder in the sky, it feels like the materials

00:11:54.320 --> 00:12:02.160
 would shrink. Yeah, it's another good point. Well, it sounds like an amazing plane. It sounds like

00:12:02.160 --> 00:12:08.240
 a hell of a plane. I'm sorry, I didn't get to fly. You know how things get faster than the speed of

00:12:08.240 --> 00:12:14.640
 light? Maybe it's that thing? Maybe it's the Einstein thing. I can only thank you all for trying to

00:12:14.640 --> 00:12:21.040
 help me out with it. I don't think we're going to get anywhere constructive. Did you know there's a

00:12:21.040 --> 00:12:30.160
 guerrilla suit on the ISS? What for? For fun. Yeah, they just wear it sometimes on the ISS.

00:12:30.960 --> 00:12:34.880
 Isn't that the least practical thing you've ever heard of being sent up there? And so it's not

00:12:34.880 --> 00:12:42.880
 sort of back up space suit. They run out of space suit. Imagine the pictures coming from the next time

00:12:42.880 --> 00:12:48.080
 that people go on the moon, and you got three of them in space suits. Some of them guys like

00:12:48.080 --> 00:12:53.520
 Arthur Faxx, I don't know how to do the guerrilla suit, I'm like, we're going to enjoy the short show.

00:12:55.280 --> 00:13:02.400
 In 2013, there was a hole in the ISS, and it was probably caused by a tiny micro meter, right?

00:13:02.400 --> 00:13:09.280
 The hole was just a few millimeters to a few centimeters wide, and they plugged it using an

00:13:09.280 --> 00:13:15.760
 astronaut's thumb. So did the astronaut have to stay next to the wall for the rest of the mission? He's

00:13:15.760 --> 00:13:24.320
 still there. He's still there, yeah. No, they cut his thumb off, no, eventually use some sealant,

00:13:24.320 --> 00:13:29.360
 but just until they managed to get their correct tools there, he had to stand there with his thumb in the

00:13:29.360 --> 00:13:34.000
 die. Wow. That's great. Very cool. What's the story about the Netherlands dying in the person

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:38.320
 who shoved their thumb in it to stop the whole country flooding? That's what you just said is the

00:13:38.320 --> 00:13:44.800
 whole story. That's it. That's the story. It was well told, I thought. Can I just talk about one more

00:13:44.800 --> 00:13:50.400
 low fine NASA fix? It's one of the best. It's in 2012 when the ISS was repaired with the toothbrush.

00:13:51.440 --> 00:13:56.800
 So yeah, this was that they they have four units on the outside that power the ISS and they're

00:13:56.800 --> 00:14:02.720
 covered in solar panels, and one of them broke. And so the space space people, the what do you call them?

00:14:02.720 --> 00:14:09.040
 Astronauts. The astronauts had to climb outside to fix it, but the bolt was stuck because it gathered

00:14:09.040 --> 00:14:13.120
 so much space dust that they couldn't quite get a handle on the bolt properly, and they didn't

00:14:13.120 --> 00:14:17.440
 have to get rid of the space dust. They were like, well, we need some sort of little kind of brush,

00:14:17.440 --> 00:14:21.520
 sort of hard stiff, and they use a toothbrush, and I don't know how they decided which astronaut

00:14:21.520 --> 00:14:26.720
 sacrifice their toothbrush, the sake of this bolt, but they brushed all the dust off. And then after

00:14:26.720 --> 00:14:30.480
 that, you're sort of brushing your teeth with space dust, which is probably, it's probably worth

00:14:30.480 --> 00:14:35.120
 the sacrifice. It feels like it would be more abrasive than a normal toothbrush. Yeah.

00:14:35.120 --> 00:14:40.400
 Might help you brushing your teeth with space dust. It could be the new thing. Coldgate might be about

00:14:40.400 --> 00:14:45.280
 to release the next space dust and toothpaste. Here's another tip. If you have a gap in your teeth,

00:14:45.280 --> 00:14:55.040
 just go up to very high altitude. Okay, it is time for fact number two, and that is James.

00:14:55.040 --> 00:15:01.760
 Okay, my fact this week is that we don't know what the Greek philosopher Plato's real name was.

00:15:01.760 --> 00:15:11.440
 Plato was his wrestling nickname. So this is from historian Diogenes Laertius, who wrote a lot about

00:15:11.440 --> 00:15:17.840
 Plato, and he said that his name came from broad shoulder, which is what Plato means, and that it was

00:15:17.840 --> 00:15:22.880
 due to his physique, because he had big muscles. He was known as being a wrestler. He apparently

00:15:22.880 --> 00:15:29.280
 competed at the Ismian Games. And we don't really know what his actual first name is. According to

00:15:29.280 --> 00:15:34.880
 Diogenes Laertius, it might have been Aristocles, which means best reputation, but we don't really

00:15:34.880 --> 00:15:40.400
 have much historical evidence for that. So most people think that probably isn't true, but we do

00:15:40.400 --> 00:15:46.320
 think that probably he got his name Plato because he was broad-shouldered. So I read there's three

00:15:46.320 --> 00:15:51.920
 possibilities for why he got called Plato. In that same category, one was broad-shoulders,

00:15:51.920 --> 00:15:57.920
 one was possibly breadth of eloquence, but my favorite one is that he had a massive forehead.

00:15:57.920 --> 00:16:03.760
 That's the third one. Did he? That's supposedly had a very wide forehead, and that might have been

00:16:03.760 --> 00:16:08.480
 why he got called that. The thing he took part in sounds really intense, this thing called the

00:16:08.480 --> 00:16:16.080
 Pancrataion, which is it's a kind of fighting where you can do everything pretty much, except

00:16:16.080 --> 00:16:22.240
 biting people and gouging out their eyes. It's a bit like Mix Martial Arts, and it's so violent

00:16:22.240 --> 00:16:27.920
 that when the Olympics came back, it was the only ancient Olympic event that was not brought back.

00:16:27.920 --> 00:16:33.760
 And the Archbishop of Leon said, "We allow all events to be reinstated except Pancrataion."

00:16:33.760 --> 00:16:39.120
 And that's what Plato was doing. He was doing the ultra-violent thing. Although he was doing the least

00:16:39.120 --> 00:16:46.640
 violent of this admittedly extremely violent practice, wasn't he? He was up there, but not quite peak.

00:16:46.640 --> 00:16:53.360
 Boxing was maybe the worst, and then the wrestling was seen as the wimp settlement of Pancrataion, I think.

00:16:53.360 --> 00:16:58.720
 But you still had people like the other Nicknick wrestling nickname I found was Mr. Fingertips,

00:16:58.720 --> 00:17:04.160
 who was a four-century BC wrestler in the Pancrataion, and he was called Mr. Fingertips because his

00:17:04.160 --> 00:17:09.440
 strategy was every time a game started, he'd bend the opponent's fingers back until they snapped,

00:17:09.440 --> 00:17:15.520
 and then that usually would mean that they caved immediately. Wow. That is a pretty basic move in

00:17:15.520 --> 00:17:22.320
 wrestling, isn't it? It's all the one ahead of pulling someone's hair, or like kneeling down behind

00:17:22.320 --> 00:17:26.720
 them and then getting someone to push them over. I don't know, it's pretty good. If you're doing a

00:17:26.720 --> 00:17:31.840
 thumb war and you immediately break your opponent's thumb, then the thumb war is one of that point. I

00:17:31.840 --> 00:17:36.560
 don't know. I always think bending people's fingers back is like a Chinese bird. It's a bit cheap,

00:17:36.560 --> 00:17:42.960
 you mean? It's not fair play. It's a bit playgroundy. Yeah. It's a seminal move in modern-day

00:17:42.960 --> 00:17:48.880
 WWF and WWE wrestling. What, breaking someone's fingers, holding their hands and gripping them

00:17:48.880 --> 00:17:54.800
 and bending them, it can lead to 10 minutes. Honestly, it's a biggie in the world of wrestling.

00:17:54.800 --> 00:18:00.240
 Is that serious, Stan? Yeah, yeah. It's a big... They've burned each other's fingers back.

00:18:00.240 --> 00:18:05.360
 Yeah, yeah, it's a move that you see a lot. It's almost a way of the wrestlers during a big match,

00:18:05.360 --> 00:18:11.600
 getting their breath back together. It's their break moment, but they really bring the theatrics.

00:18:11.600 --> 00:18:15.280
 It just makes it look like you're doing one of these country dances where someone skips underneath

00:18:15.280 --> 00:18:23.840
 the arch there. I wonder if, you know, modern-day boxing and so on, half of the whole thing is the

00:18:23.840 --> 00:18:28.560
 smack talk that happens, you know, the taunting and so on. I'm just wondering what Plato's smack talk

00:18:28.560 --> 00:18:33.600
 would be like, because he would dish out new philosophical ideas that would crush your whole

00:18:33.600 --> 00:18:39.200
 understanding of the earth. How could you fight once you've been told about existence in your place

00:18:39.200 --> 00:18:44.080
 in the universe? I don't know. I think it's particularly easy to punch that guy in the face to be honest.

00:18:44.080 --> 00:18:51.920
 He might have shouted that you were a featherless biped. That was one of his human slams.

00:18:51.920 --> 00:18:58.480
 That was how he defined man, and I think it was sort of saying we're really no different from

00:18:58.480 --> 00:19:03.600
 creatures in a lot of ways, but then he came up against Diogenes the cynic, who said that's a

00:19:03.600 --> 00:19:09.760
 ridiculous way to define man, and he brought to Plato a live chicken and plucked it in front of his

00:19:09.760 --> 00:19:15.840
 very eyes. Wait, sorry, he plucked the chicken live, because if so, Diogenes has a lot of questions to

00:19:15.840 --> 00:19:20.640
 answer. I think it's better than killing a chicken just in order to pluck it to make a philosophical point.

00:19:20.640 --> 00:19:27.840
 I think it's tough to pluck a live chicken. I think that's a real skill. I've never tried,

00:19:27.840 --> 00:19:32.160
 but frankly, he should have been called Diogenes the optimist if he thought he was going to get away.

00:19:32.160 --> 00:19:39.920
 Maybe he was a wrestler too and got it in a headlock or something. That's Plato held out,

00:19:39.920 --> 00:19:46.480
 but Plato was forced to amend his definition of man to a featherless biped with broad flat nails.

00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:53.040
 That distinguishes us from the chicken. Does that mean like finger nails and toenails and stuff?

00:19:53.040 --> 00:19:57.360
 It just means basically, I think he looked for the first thing that we have that chicken doesn't.

00:19:57.360 --> 00:20:01.120
 Quite a lot to pick from. He went for the nails. But he went for the chickens have got nails.

00:20:01.120 --> 00:20:05.360
 But they don't know. They've got bendy-like questions. Oh yeah, that's true, yeah. They're not

00:20:05.360 --> 00:20:10.240
 flat. Wow, it feels like a bit of a reach from Plato at that point. But here's what I'm thinking,

00:20:10.240 --> 00:20:15.760
 right? He said broad flat nails. Plato means broad. We don't know where the broad bit comes from,

00:20:15.760 --> 00:20:23.440
 maybe he had extremely broad nails. He just had really flat fingers. Maybe that's where he got his

00:20:23.440 --> 00:20:29.280
 nails. Just the first thing you noticed about him. Diogenes, if Diogenes was taking the piss out of

00:20:29.280 --> 00:20:35.200
 you, I think that's pretty bad because he lived in a barrel. Didn't he? Yeah, he did. If someone's

00:20:35.200 --> 00:20:38.640
 coming up to you taking the piss and it's like, mate, you live in a barrel. He lives in a barrel.

00:20:38.640 --> 00:20:44.240
 And he's a cynic. Was he Oscar the Grouch? Who's this? He basically, oh my god, he basically was.

00:20:45.280 --> 00:20:49.680
 I think Oscar the Grouch is based on him. I think he was just trying to show the vanity of

00:20:49.680 --> 00:20:53.840
 human vanity, you know. Yeah, he lived in a jar to tell humans that they were all

00:20:53.840 --> 00:20:58.320
 dickheads. Wait, a jar or a barrel? Because I think a jar is worse. A jar of smaller, normally.

00:20:58.320 --> 00:21:02.000
 Yeah. It's called a jar usually, but I think it was quite a large one. I don't think he squeezed

00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:10.480
 himself into like a jam jar. Yeah. Well, he also, he masturbated in his barrel. Oh no.

00:21:10.480 --> 00:21:14.400
 Well, I hope it wasn't a jar then because that would be a hell of a view to everyone passing by.

00:21:14.400 --> 00:21:18.160
 People didn't find that amusing and he used to defecate in theatres and stuff, didn't he?

00:21:18.160 --> 00:21:25.040
 Wait, he was trying to excuse society, I think, is the point. I might be wrong about this because I

00:21:25.040 --> 00:21:28.240
 don't know much about diabetes, but I think that's what he was trying to do. And he was trying to go

00:21:28.240 --> 00:21:34.080
 and get societal norms. Yeah. And he lived in a barrel, but then he still needed to masturbate because

00:21:34.080 --> 00:21:38.480
 he was, you know, he had urges and he couldn't leave his barrel. So we had to do it in a barrel, but

00:21:38.480 --> 00:21:43.360
 people didn't like it very much. Damn, why did you say just that it was so, it was so particularly

00:21:43.360 --> 00:21:48.880
 bad to masturbate in the jar. Well, your barrel, no one's going to see inside. You can do that in private

00:21:48.880 --> 00:21:55.200
 in your barrel. Your jar, your David Blaining it. People are going to come and visit to see what you're

00:21:55.200 --> 00:22:00.160
 up to. Sure, did David Blaine do that? If I'd known that, I would have watched his whole, you know,

00:22:00.160 --> 00:22:05.920
 stuck in a box gig. I'm not sure if he did. Did he leave the jar to go into the theatre to have a poo?

00:22:05.920 --> 00:22:12.880
 Or did he have the jar taken into the theatre? Well, like roll it along like a hamster wheel.

00:22:12.880 --> 00:22:18.720
 Yeah. And then sort of poo out of the end of it. I think this might have been at two different stages

00:22:18.720 --> 00:22:26.640
 of his life. I think he might have been past his barrel years. So he's pooing in the fit of years.

00:22:26.640 --> 00:22:32.320
 You've got to keep it fresh for people, haven't you? You've got to keep sticking up. He famously,

00:22:32.320 --> 00:22:38.560
 the thing about masturbating was he always said it because I think he begged for food, baby.

00:22:38.560 --> 00:22:44.480
 And yeah, he said it'd be better if I could satisfy my hunger by rubbing my belly in the same way

00:22:44.480 --> 00:22:51.600
 that I satisfy my sexual needs by rubbing my genitals. That was his saying. Wow. That was his catchphrase.

00:22:51.600 --> 00:22:57.360
 Pretty bold decision by the Sesame Street writers. The phase Oscar the Grinch on his gun.

00:23:01.120 --> 00:23:09.200
 There are a lot of unedited scenes in that. He actually is quite interesting. He gave an explanation

00:23:09.200 --> 00:23:14.320
 for the origin of the word cynic, diogenes. So someone said why do they call you diogenes the cynic?

00:23:14.320 --> 00:23:18.480
 And it meant diogenes the dog-like as it's from the same river. It's like canine.

00:23:18.480 --> 00:23:21.680
 Right. And I think he said. So just do a poo wherever I want.

00:23:21.680 --> 00:23:29.600
 I just shit everywhere. No, he said it's because I fall upon those who give me

00:23:29.600 --> 00:23:34.480
 anything and bark at those who give me nothing. That cynicism, that's where that's coming from,

00:23:34.480 --> 00:23:36.160
 according to him. That's interesting.

00:23:36.160 --> 00:23:44.880
 Okay, it is time for fact number three and that is Andy. My fact is that the first ever

00:23:44.880 --> 00:23:49.440
 internal combustion engine was partially powered by explosive moss.

00:23:49.440 --> 00:23:57.600
 Wow. Oh god. Now people who listen to his podcast might not know about

00:23:57.600 --> 00:24:02.080
 add these obsession with moss because we've never let him do a moss fight before.

00:24:02.080 --> 00:24:06.160
 But for one of our books, was it the last book we did or the one before?

00:24:06.160 --> 00:24:13.200
 It was the one before. Yeah. Book of the year 2018 maybe. We had an article on club moss and it was

00:24:13.200 --> 00:24:17.680
 and these absolute fave. It was the longest article in the book at the time of submission

00:24:17.680 --> 00:24:25.680
 and weirdly it was the shortest but it actually made it to print. So revenge time. So this is an

00:24:25.680 --> 00:24:30.880
 internal combustion engine powered by small internal explosions and the thing which provided

00:24:30.880 --> 00:24:39.360
 the explosions was this moss. The machine was called the pyreon of four and it was patented in 1807

00:24:39.360 --> 00:24:45.760
 which I find unbelievably early as in the patent was signed by Napoleon for this machine.

00:24:45.760 --> 00:24:55.360
 And it was patented by a French inventor called Nissefore Niepse and this machine ran

00:24:55.360 --> 00:25:01.040
 a boat. The engine was attached to a boat and it was full of lycopodium dust which was from a

00:25:01.040 --> 00:25:08.560
 particular species of club moss and it's very explosive this stuff because it has lots of surface

00:25:08.560 --> 00:25:15.840
 area and it's 50% fat so it goes bang quite readily when it's supposed to flame and there was a boat

00:25:15.840 --> 00:25:21.920
 going around up and down rivers. That's incredible. I didn't look into this specific one and it

00:25:21.920 --> 00:25:28.400
 actually powered a boat but I think it was quite a small boat wasn't it? It wasn't a huge boat,

00:25:28.400 --> 00:25:33.360
 was it? Was it on a model boating pond? It wasn't a model boat. It was not because I did read

00:25:33.360 --> 00:25:38.000
 one place that said it was a toy boat but I couldn't tell whether it was or not. I mean all boats are toy

00:25:38.000 --> 00:25:48.400
 boats if you're a giant. Okay it wasn't a massive boat. I think let's go that far. But it wasn't

00:25:48.400 --> 00:25:54.480
 only a centimetre long. It was somewhere in between the two. It was somewhere in between a centimetre

00:25:54.480 --> 00:26:00.480
 at the Titanic. Yeah exactly. That was it. It clarified that for me. Thank you. It was pretty clever

00:26:00.480 --> 00:26:04.720
 how it worked though wasn't it because it would use the energy from this combustion engine and it

00:26:04.720 --> 00:26:09.200
 would suck water in from the front and push it out of the back and then it would use that movement

00:26:09.200 --> 00:26:16.880
 to power it forward. Yeah it was very clever. And just on a little tangent, Niepse, the inventor,

00:26:16.880 --> 00:26:22.400
 it was him and his brother who did it. Niepse is also the man who produced one of the first ever

00:26:22.400 --> 00:26:28.080
 photographic images 20 years later. Imagine being at the beginning of those two technologies.

00:26:28.080 --> 00:26:34.880
 Did he use the photographic flash in its early days then wasn't it and they used all sorts of

00:26:34.880 --> 00:26:38.800
 explosives and I think they used this in photography and flash photography and I wonder if he

00:26:38.800 --> 00:26:44.640
 used that. Was he a one-trick pony and he only ever used his club monster? I don't know. I think his

00:26:44.640 --> 00:26:50.800
 photography being as it was the very very first one that ever existed was before flashes to be honest.

00:26:50.800 --> 00:26:58.480
 The first one that he did, it was called The View From The Window at Legra and it was in 1826

00:26:58.480 --> 00:27:05.440
 and the exposure time was eight hours so I think flash would have helped much in that case. Don't blink,

00:27:05.440 --> 00:27:12.640
 don't blink. And the light was a problem because they didn't have flashes but they used the light

00:27:12.640 --> 00:27:17.920
 of the sun but obviously the sun is not in the same place for eight hours and so if you look at this

00:27:17.920 --> 00:27:25.200
 picture it looks a bit like a charcoal etching to be honest. It's not 4K but you can see the sunlight

00:27:25.200 --> 00:27:30.400
 on the left hand side and the right hand side because of the amount of time it took to expose.

00:27:30.400 --> 00:27:37.680
 Can I just say about club monster quickly? I just want to formally apologise Andy. It's amazing.

00:27:37.680 --> 00:27:43.760
 Thank you. Thank you. I watched an amazing video by a buddy of ours, Mutual Body of the podcast Steve

00:27:43.760 --> 00:27:50.080
 Mold from the Festival of Spoken Nerd where he has powder, a powdered version of it and showing

00:27:50.080 --> 00:27:57.040
 just how hydrophobic it is. So the idea is that you could dip your hand into a big body of water

00:27:57.040 --> 00:28:02.000
 if you have the powder just laying on top of the surface area and come back out your hand will be

00:28:02.000 --> 00:28:06.720
 sort of latexed a bit. It looks like you've gone marigold glove but you'll have a completely dry

00:28:06.720 --> 00:28:11.600
 hand that you can powder off. I mean it's an extraordinary substance. I've never heard of that before.

00:28:11.600 --> 00:28:17.760
 And you can set fire to water using it. It's so extremely flammable and it coats the water

00:28:17.760 --> 00:28:24.880
 without being absorbed by it so you can sort of pour water covered in club moss spores out of a jar

00:28:24.880 --> 00:28:30.720
 and then set fire to it and it looks pretty cool. There are lots of uses so it was as Anna said it was

00:28:30.720 --> 00:28:37.280
 used for flash powder for photographers before they invented flash bulbs. It was also used to coat

00:28:37.280 --> 00:28:44.480
 suppositories. I'm not exactly sure why. Is it the same reason as your hydrophobic thing as in

00:28:44.480 --> 00:28:49.440
 basically you know what I've been to stick to it basically? Yes, in fact it would be that because

00:28:49.440 --> 00:28:54.880
 it was also used as a coating for condoms then because it was used specifically to stop the latex

00:28:54.880 --> 00:29:00.080
 and condoms from sticking to the rest of the condom. This is before we had modern condoms.

00:29:00.080 --> 00:29:06.400
 You said condoms a lot of time in that sense. It felt very, felt very racy saying that all those times.

00:29:06.400 --> 00:29:12.720
 I suppose the problem is basically you're using spores and it's not a good idea to put spores

00:29:12.720 --> 00:29:19.200
 in your vagina or anus. Is that in case you give birth just sort of a moss human hybrid?

00:29:19.200 --> 00:29:28.480
 No, it's in case it goes off like a flash bulb. It's balloons inside you and that actually is where

00:29:28.480 --> 00:29:34.640
 the term flashing used to come from because women used to go around parks and then open their big

00:29:34.640 --> 00:29:40.800
 raincoats and it would be like a camera flash. That's incredible. Amazing etymology, I never knew that.

00:29:40.800 --> 00:29:44.960
 I'm not, I'm not buying it. I knew you were trying to make me believe that and I'm not buying it.

00:29:44.960 --> 00:29:49.600
 No, Dan, it's true. It's true. Dojo needs the cynic used to stick his bum out of the barrel and

00:29:49.600 --> 00:29:55.680
 you go, hey, look at this bang. No, but yeah, James, you're absolutely right. Sticking spores in

00:29:55.680 --> 00:30:01.200
 yourself is a bad idea, but this moss was even used to coat surgical gloves. So you would literally

00:30:01.200 --> 00:30:06.800
 have it decide to go in the internal organ to people. But you wouldn't need the glove, right? If you

00:30:06.800 --> 00:30:12.640
 were a doctor doing a finger at the bum check, you would just need to coat one finger in this club

00:30:12.640 --> 00:30:20.400
 moss and you say, well, you're saving four unused fingers of a glove. So, you know, that's handy.

00:30:20.400 --> 00:30:25.360
 From what you're saying, it sounds like if you're a doctor, then you could use a glove five times

00:30:25.360 --> 00:30:30.320
 in five different bottoms because you got five fingers. Is that, is that what you're saying? That's

00:30:30.320 --> 00:30:35.040
 literally what I'm saying. Yeah. Oh, could you say no offense, mate. Honestly, it's just I only

00:30:35.040 --> 00:30:40.880
 have the middle finger left. I only have the thong left. I know I've got broad nails.

00:30:40.880 --> 00:30:50.400
 They call me play. Do you know some people who like moss are the Japanese?

00:30:51.680 --> 00:30:56.480
 Yes. My Japanese friend is obsessed with it. Is that true data point? Yeah. Yeah. She goes around

00:30:56.480 --> 00:31:00.960
 collecting it. That's so interesting because I read this on the internet and I thought, if I say

00:31:00.960 --> 00:31:05.200
 there's probably lots of Japanese people right in as they were not obsessed with moss. So I'm so glad

00:31:05.200 --> 00:31:11.920
 that we have at least one datum. But there was a book written in 2011 called moss is my dear friends

00:31:11.920 --> 00:31:18.640
 and it sell 40,000 copies in Japan. And these days you can get moss themed drinks and you can get

00:31:19.280 --> 00:31:24.080
 like a ring which has moss in it. So instead of like a diamond, it sprouts out a little bit moss.

00:31:24.080 --> 00:31:31.040
 And actually the Japanese national anthem contains the word moss. Does it? It genuinely does.

00:31:31.040 --> 00:31:37.600
 It goes, "May your world go on for thousands of years until pebbles merge into one giant rock

00:31:37.600 --> 00:31:43.200
 that's covered with moss." That's great. It probably sounds better in the original language.

00:31:43.200 --> 00:31:49.040
 I do think so, yeah. So moss, actual moss, which is a club moss is an actual moss,

00:31:49.040 --> 00:31:55.600
 but actual moss is a real lifesaver. So it was used a lot in the First World War on wounds because

00:31:55.600 --> 00:31:59.680
 they ran out of bandages. So many people were getting injured. A lot of exposed flesh, a lot of stuff

00:31:59.680 --> 00:32:05.680
 was rotting and they suddenly realized they could stuff a wound with moss. And first of all, it's

00:32:05.680 --> 00:32:10.720
 incredibly good at absorbing liquid. So if you're bleeding, it's very good at absorbing that. It can

00:32:10.720 --> 00:32:17.520
 absorb 22 times its own weight in liquid. It's twice as absorbed of as cotton. And it's because 90%

00:32:17.520 --> 00:32:21.680
 of the cells in moss are dead. So they're just like water bottles waiting there to be filled.

00:32:21.680 --> 00:32:26.880
 And also it makes the environment around it really acidic, which makes it sterilizing. So it also

00:32:26.880 --> 00:32:32.560
 sterilizes wounds. So if you get a little soft, shove some moss in it. I think is it a very specific kind

00:32:32.560 --> 00:32:38.320
 of moss that they use. I can use any old, I can't use any old moss. It's fagnum moss, isn't it? Yeah.

00:32:38.320 --> 00:32:43.920
 Fagnum's awesome. They used to use it for diapers as well. Ancient cultures would put it sort of

00:32:43.920 --> 00:32:49.760
 in a bag like casing and put it around the children. So when they went to the toilet, acted the same.

00:32:49.760 --> 00:32:52.320
 It's another reason why Diogenes kept it in his barrel, isn't it?

00:32:52.320 --> 00:32:59.680
 Fagnum is really good. So there are about 380 species. It's a whole genus, it's fagnum moss.

00:32:59.680 --> 00:33:04.880
 But in the first world war, they had to harvest it from peat bogs because peat bogs are largely

00:33:04.880 --> 00:33:13.440
 fagnum moss basically. And by the end of 1916, they were making a million moss dressings every single month.

00:33:13.440 --> 00:33:17.760
 Wow. So it's a huge endeavor to create all that stuff. Yeah, yeah.

00:33:17.760 --> 00:33:23.280
 It's fagnum is great. Fagnum is the main ingredient of peat and that is... What's your favourite? And

00:33:23.280 --> 00:33:29.840
 is it fagnum moss or club moss or just general mosses in general? I think more cake moss. It's fagnum.

00:33:29.840 --> 00:33:35.840
 It's not cake moss. I think it's fagnum. Imagine cake moss. Cake moss is your third favourite moss

00:33:35.840 --> 00:33:42.480
 I'm including moss from the IT crowd. I think cake is my fourth favourite moss. Cake doesn't even

00:33:42.480 --> 00:33:51.520
 list. Okay, it's time for our final fact of the show and that is Chazinsky. My favorite this week is

00:33:51.520 --> 00:33:58.320
 that we have arches in our feet for the same reason that we fold slices of peata if we do that.

00:33:58.320 --> 00:34:05.760
 Is it because feet are so delicious? The cheesy, they're cheesy. We don't want to spill any of the

00:34:05.760 --> 00:34:13.520
 cheese. It's to stop. The cheese falling off. Yeah. This is a thing that Americans do a bit more than

00:34:13.520 --> 00:34:17.680
 I think. The peats are folding. I think maybe because they have bigger slices. So you fold a slice of

00:34:17.680 --> 00:34:24.240
 pizza and it makes it stronger and a new study has just been done into foot arches and it's been

00:34:24.240 --> 00:34:29.360
 discovered that this is the reason for one of the arches in our feet and it's actually the lesser

00:34:29.360 --> 00:34:35.680
 appreciated arch. So this study is about you've got the big attention seeking arch right which is

00:34:35.680 --> 00:34:41.120
 the longitudinal arch which runs from front to back and then you've got the transverse arch

00:34:41.120 --> 00:34:45.360
 which runs the width of your foot and you can really see the transverse arch when you look at the

00:34:45.360 --> 00:34:51.040
 top of your foot. It's the lump on the top of your foot and essentially they've looked at that

00:34:51.040 --> 00:34:55.600
 and they applied lots of pressure to it. These scientists they got where do they got cadavers

00:34:55.600 --> 00:35:00.240
 and they put weights on them and then they cut the transverse arch to see what kind of weight they

00:35:00.240 --> 00:35:06.800
 could hold comparatively and they found that the stiffness of a foot is reduced by 40% when you cut

00:35:06.800 --> 00:35:15.520
 that transverse arch. So it's therefore stiffness. What is an arch made of? It's bone ligament,

00:35:15.520 --> 00:35:22.000
 tendony, all that shit. The usual shit that the body is made of. Okay. That's really helpful.

00:35:22.000 --> 00:35:29.040
 Thanks Dr. Arna. Well you know it's been a bone and ligament. The foot doesn't have a quarter of

00:35:29.040 --> 00:35:34.160
 the bones in your body. Both your feet combined. Have a quarter of the body's bones. So it's really

00:35:34.160 --> 00:35:37.840
 really important that I've feted this stiff. It's one of the things that really distinguishes us from

00:35:37.840 --> 00:35:44.160
 other great apes is that we have the arches in our foot generally which allow us to be bipedal

00:35:44.160 --> 00:35:49.440
 and to walk and run particularly over really long distances. So if you look at the feet of

00:35:49.440 --> 00:35:54.800
 chimps then they're completely flat and that means that they can grab onto trees and stuff like that

00:35:54.800 --> 00:36:00.000
 but they cannot run a marathon. So in your face chimps. Well I know what you're saying about in your

00:36:00.000 --> 00:36:04.720
 face chimps but what I was thinking is what would you rather have feet that let you climb a tree or

00:36:04.720 --> 00:36:11.120
 feet that let you run a marathon. It depends on what you're trying to escape from. Yeah. If you're

00:36:11.120 --> 00:36:17.600
 trying to escape from Polarachlif. Probably climbing a tree. If you're trying to escape from

00:36:17.600 --> 00:36:23.200
 Tarzan. Exactly. He probably beat you at a marathon as well. Yeah. Yeah, he definitely won. But actually

00:36:23.200 --> 00:36:31.520
 I think it doesn't matter whether you've got this thing or not. So there was a study of people who

00:36:31.520 --> 00:36:37.440
 visited the Boston Museum of Science and they studied all of their feet and they found that some,

00:36:37.440 --> 00:36:42.240
 I know, one of weird gig researchers just to hang around the museum and say hey can I give you a

00:36:42.240 --> 00:36:50.080
 feed. But they found that some people had a mid-tasal break. Okay. And what that means is that the middle

00:36:50.080 --> 00:36:56.240
 of the foot bends quite easily as you push yourself off the ground. So one in 13 people has weird

00:36:56.240 --> 00:37:02.720
 folding ape-like feet. And if you have this and you walk on a beach you might see there's more of

00:37:02.720 --> 00:37:06.880
 a ridge in the middle portion of your footprint which shows that that's where your foot basically

00:37:06.880 --> 00:37:12.080
 folds as you step. And most people don't know they've got this which is very exciting. I think it

00:37:12.080 --> 00:37:17.120
 would matter if you were doing a marathon every day. Yeah, that's true. If you're kind of doing a lot

00:37:17.120 --> 00:37:22.160
 of long distance running it would probably start to hurt quite a lot. Yeah, that's, yeah. Although

00:37:22.160 --> 00:37:25.760
 it hurts all the time anyway if you do lots of long distance running so you probably wouldn't notice.

00:37:25.760 --> 00:37:30.800
 That's fair enough. And like kind of says though the arch is a for stiffness. So if you didn't have an

00:37:30.800 --> 00:37:37.040
 arch going transversely so going from left to right and you had flat feet then you wouldn't have

00:37:37.040 --> 00:37:41.520
 any stiffness in your feet at all and they'd just be like floppy bits of cardboard. Yeah. That would

00:37:41.520 --> 00:37:48.000
 be a problem. Yeah, that's true. So Anna, also, if this applies to American pizzas which are much longer

00:37:48.000 --> 00:37:53.840
 than say a British pizza, if you have smaller feet do you need the arch as much? I guess you need

00:37:53.840 --> 00:37:59.600
 them less because you're bearing less weight. I mean it would be proportional. And it's actually a

00:37:59.600 --> 00:38:03.840
 thing called Gaussian curvature which is something that we briefly discussed years ago on the show

00:38:03.840 --> 00:38:09.520
 when we were talking about corrugated iron and it's the amazing effect that you'll all remember that

00:38:09.520 --> 00:38:16.960
 classic episode. I think it was in the 60s so we've just put a load of episodes back up for free and

00:38:16.960 --> 00:38:23.680
 I think it's one of those. It is. So I will be good news guys. It was an absolute classic of the genre.

00:38:23.680 --> 00:38:28.800
 I highly recommend the corrugated iron session and we talk partly about how the shape of that makes

00:38:28.800 --> 00:38:34.160
 it stronger and it's the same reason that for instance you can't crack an egg if you squeeze it

00:38:34.160 --> 00:38:43.200
 really hard and this is the thing that this guy called. I mean I think I can. I can. You can't. I can.

00:38:43.200 --> 00:38:51.680
 You can't. Look, I haven't seen an egg for weeks. I can't at the moment. I have an egg downstairs.

00:38:51.680 --> 00:38:56.560
 Can I run down and get it? Yeah. Don't talk me on camera by breaking one of your few available

00:38:56.560 --> 00:39:01.520
 stocks of eggs. You won't be able to break it. You can break it if you shove your thumb into it but if

00:39:01.520 --> 00:39:05.760
 you just squeeze it. If I just squeeze it, you will break it. Should I genuinely do it or should we

00:39:05.760 --> 00:39:09.520
 forget it and just move on? I mean it's an enormous waste of time because you won't be able to do it

00:39:09.520 --> 00:39:12.960
 or you'll cheat and shove your thumb in or bang it against your mouth. I'm not going to cheat.

00:39:12.960 --> 00:39:17.280
 And then you'll be able to become an egg. That's win-win, isn't it? It's win-win, you should do it.

00:39:17.280 --> 00:39:22.320
 You should put your face beneath it so that if you end up with egg on your face you actually won't

00:39:22.320 --> 00:39:30.720
 end up with egg on your face. If you do manage to do this at home, try it if you want as long as you

00:39:30.720 --> 00:39:35.600
 don't waste food. But if you've got an egg that's gone after it, sometimes you'll get an egg which

00:39:35.600 --> 00:39:40.880
 has got some kind of imperfections in it and it is possible if your egg is not, you know, if there's

00:39:40.880 --> 00:39:46.640
 problem with your egg. Here's the caveat. There we go. But most of the time it is impossible to break

00:39:46.640 --> 00:39:52.480
 an egg just by squeezing it. It is cool. Although weirdly I read that a way of really emphasising the

00:39:52.480 --> 00:39:57.360
 Gaussian curvature, the strength of it is to have a hyperbolic paraboloid which is basically having

00:39:57.360 --> 00:40:01.440
 something that's curved in two directions, a bit like our foot. And something that uses that is power

00:40:01.440 --> 00:40:07.440
 stations. So you know if you look at power station, it's curved or the cooling tower. A cooling tower,

00:40:07.440 --> 00:40:14.320
 yeah. It's sort of doubly curved because it's rounded but it's also got that curve going in.

00:40:14.320 --> 00:40:19.440
 It's the opposite of what we have on our feet. So in your feet, your curves are both going in

00:40:19.440 --> 00:40:24.480
 the same direction. Good point. So if you turn your toes in, then it's bending in the same way that

00:40:24.480 --> 00:40:30.160
 the left to right of your foot goes. I'm not explaining this very well. But it's more like a

00:40:30.160 --> 00:40:36.240
 pringle. If you think of a pringle, it kind of from top to bottom, it curves one way and then from left

00:40:36.240 --> 00:40:40.560
 to right, it curves the other way. That's why it's impossible to break a pringle if you hold it in

00:40:40.560 --> 00:40:46.960
 your hand and squeeze. I've tried it. I can't do it. This is my problem. This is my problem with

00:40:46.960 --> 00:40:52.560
 hyperbolic paraboloids. It's always used as the example. They go and pringles use this technology as

00:40:52.560 --> 00:40:57.600
 well. And it's like, what are you talking about? The entire selling point in pringles is that you

00:40:57.600 --> 00:41:02.960
 can crunch them. They wouldn't be nearly as crunchy if they were flat. Oh, yeah. That'll be disgusting.

00:41:02.960 --> 00:41:09.360
 I would hate to eat a flat pringle genuinely. Really? Yeah. That sounds like an off. It just

00:41:09.360 --> 00:41:16.160
 sounds creepy, doesn't it? You know what's even stronger? If you have a corrugated iron style

00:41:16.160 --> 00:41:21.680
 crisp, like a kai's kind of thing, a corrugated crisp, now that's a strong crisp. I can jump up and

00:41:21.680 --> 00:41:29.360
 down on one of those things for days and get nowhere. Have you guys heard of Douglas Morson? No. I was

00:41:29.360 --> 00:41:34.960
 just studying things about the souls of the feet. So he was an Antarctic explorer when he wasn't

00:41:34.960 --> 00:41:41.440
 Antarctic. He was Australian actually, but he was exploring the Antarctic in 1912. And he wasn't

00:41:41.440 --> 00:41:46.560
 bothering with the poll. He was doing the most ambitious exploration of Antarctica ever. You know,

00:41:46.560 --> 00:41:52.000
 thousands or hundreds of miles, at least, of Antarctica's very desert interior. He was trying to,

00:41:52.000 --> 00:41:58.240
 you know, explore and map it. Anyway, on his way back, with a hundred miles to go, his partner had

00:41:58.240 --> 00:42:07.600
 died. He discovered that the souls of his feet had completely detached from the foot above genuinely.

00:42:07.600 --> 00:42:14.240
 I don't think is that possible? There was blood and pus spurting out and just all the skin of the

00:42:14.240 --> 00:42:19.760
 souls of his feet had come off. So somewhere there's an actual footprint laying in the snow? Well,

00:42:19.760 --> 00:42:26.320
 what he had to do was he had to tape the dead souls back onto his feet and put six pairs of socks on

00:42:26.320 --> 00:42:31.520
 and then keep walking. Oh, wow. Well, anyway, he survived. He survived and he became a national hero and

00:42:31.520 --> 00:42:37.760
 he left another 46 years. So the story has a happy ending in some senses. He was lost for ages,

00:42:37.760 --> 00:42:41.440
 wasn't he? Wasn't he away for years? And his wife married someone else and then he returned

00:42:41.440 --> 00:42:46.400
 to up 12 years later and... That's the dishears you're talking about. That's sorry.

00:42:46.400 --> 00:42:49.840
 Surely when he came back, he would be like an inch shorter than when he left.

00:42:49.840 --> 00:42:57.200
 I would know my husband anyway and he was five, seven, ten, your five foot nine and a half.

00:42:57.200 --> 00:43:04.480
 So most of them on feet? Yes, please, yeah. Our feet are just really good. I think we should be more

00:43:04.480 --> 00:43:10.400
 proud of our feet and I think we should just bound trainers. This is, I've sort of been brainwashed

00:43:10.400 --> 00:43:15.360
 because there was that study that was quite famous in 2004 by that harbour professor and then a book

00:43:15.360 --> 00:43:20.480
 based on it called Born to Run, which is a really good book but sort of about how we are, we're born to

00:43:20.480 --> 00:43:26.800
 run and our feet are made for it. And if you look at, we did in this series of QI, the Raramuri people

00:43:26.800 --> 00:43:32.720
 in Mexico and they can run for hundreds and hundreds of miles and they just do it in as thinner sandal

00:43:32.720 --> 00:43:37.280
 as possible because the ideal way to run is just to have a very thin surface to protect you from

00:43:37.280 --> 00:43:43.920
 stones or needles and then just use your foot's natural strength. You can tell how fast a runner

00:43:43.920 --> 00:43:50.400
 you will be by how long your toes are. Can you believe this? Yes, sprinters have longer toes than

00:43:50.400 --> 00:43:55.840
 non-sprinters and that's partly because if you have longer toes your feet stay in contact with the

00:43:55.840 --> 00:44:01.440
 ground very slightly longer. Okay, is it also because like whoever gets to the end first it can be

00:44:01.440 --> 00:44:07.440
 any body part, can it, the cross is the line that determines the winner. So if you have massive clown feet.

00:44:07.440 --> 00:44:11.760
 That's why so many of the best sprinters are clowns.

00:44:11.760 --> 00:44:20.480
 Oh, it's who's saying bought in the lead but no wait, here's Bobo the clown behind him, he's going up fast.

00:44:20.480 --> 00:44:29.360
 Hey, do you know, you know Einstein famously didn't wear socks. Yeah, famously. Well, I think if

00:44:29.360 --> 00:44:33.680
 you asked anyone for one fact about Einstein, that's what that's why he won his Nobel Prize for,

00:44:33.680 --> 00:44:38.960
 wasn't it? Yeah, yeah, yeah. That's pretty famous, isn't it? He was a non-sock-wearing guy.

00:44:38.960 --> 00:44:44.560
 I had never heard that before. I think it's famous in the context of this podcast, I think, but yeah.

00:44:44.560 --> 00:44:48.720
 No, I've genuinely never heard that done. That's very interesting. Okay, so he's not wearing socks.

00:44:48.720 --> 00:44:54.240
 Well, we don't know, he never said the real reason but there is a thought that it's because he suffered

00:44:54.240 --> 00:45:04.400
 from excessive foot sweatiness. He was famous in the military circles for having sweaty feet.

00:45:04.400 --> 00:45:10.000
 To the point where he was not allowed to sign up for the Swiss military because they said that his

00:45:10.000 --> 00:45:14.480
 feet were too sweaty. They don't buy you from the military because you got sweaty feet.

00:45:14.480 --> 00:45:20.560
 He had flat feet, varicose veins and excessive foot perspiration was what's on the official report.

00:45:20.560 --> 00:45:25.920
 Maybe he would give away if they were trying to attack somewhere by night, like a surprise attack,

00:45:25.920 --> 00:45:35.200
 but then they were... Yeah, surely, then, if you have sweaty feet, you would wear socks because

00:45:35.200 --> 00:45:40.400
 that's going to soak up the sweat. I would wear socks lined with sphagnum moss, which can absorb

00:45:40.400 --> 00:45:46.320
 30 times, so weight and water. Yeah, no, as I say, he never said it was for that reason,

00:45:46.320 --> 00:45:50.160
 it just, it's an interesting thing to note. I think you wouldn't want to go around with wet socks,

00:45:50.160 --> 00:45:56.720
 but then you've just got wet shoes instead, right? Yeah, but the soul that inner padding is a bit more

00:45:56.720 --> 00:46:01.200
 of a, I think you could suck more water into that and not be wet. No, I mean, because the worst

00:46:01.200 --> 00:46:05.360
 thing about wearing no socks and trainers is the fact that it's too sweaty, although it does make

00:46:05.360 --> 00:46:09.600
 sense that the military wouldn't allow him in because that's why Prince Andrew was so desirable

00:46:09.600 --> 00:46:15.440
 to the military, wasn't it? An inability to sweat is really something that they do look for.

00:46:15.440 --> 00:46:20.240
 And interestingly, he's very good at holding pizzas when he's in pizza expressed because he's learned

00:46:20.240 --> 00:46:25.040
 the calcium curvature. We're talking about that.

00:46:25.040 --> 00:46:34.960
 Okay, that's it. That is all of our facts. Thank you so much for listening. If you want to get in

00:46:34.960 --> 00:46:38.400

 or our website. NoSuchThing is a fish.com. We've got all of our previous episodes up there. In fact,

00:46:56.240 --> 00:47:00.640
 we have more than usual amounts of previous episodes up there. As we said at the top of the episode,

00:47:00.640 --> 00:47:06.960
 we've just re-uploaded 52 episodes. The second year of fish, so do check them out. And as we said

00:47:06.960 --> 00:47:12.320
 last week, guys, we really hope you're doing okay. Scary times out there, but take care of each other.

00:47:12.320 --> 00:47:14.800
 We'll be back again next week. See you then. Goodbye.

00:47:14.800 --> 00:47:29.600
 Can I just say as well, I'm pretty sure other has lost signal over that. Or the Clifnospagina

00:47:29.600 --> 00:47:35.760
 material is not working very well because she's currently completely still on the same pretty good point. That

00:47:35.760 --> 00:47:40.160
 took me a long time to notice. I wonder how long she's been gunned. I wonder how much she's... She's not gone,

00:47:40.160 --> 00:47:41.840
 she's just stunned.

00:47:41.840 --> 00:47:43.840
 [laughs]

00:47:43.840 --> 00:47:49.840
 [music]

00:47:49.840 --> 00:47:50.680
 (upbeat music)
