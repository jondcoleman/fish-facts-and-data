00:00:00,00:00:03,"Hi everyone, James here. Now, before we start this week's show, which is another"
00:00:03,00:00:09,"working from home episode, where we recorded in all of our different homes around the country."
00:00:09,00:00:13,I just want to say I hope everyone's all right. I hope that you're all staying indoors. I hope
00:00:13,00:00:18,you're all looking after your family and friends. But there's just one little bit of news that I
00:00:18,00:00:24,"wanted to say, which we mentioned last week, but that is that we have re-released the second year"
00:00:24,00:00:29,"of No Such Things A Fish for free on the internet. So, if you go to the place where you normally"
00:00:29,00:00:35,"get your podcasts, you will see episodes 53 to 104 and they were not there in the past. So,"
00:00:35,00:00:40,there's hours and hours of fun on there. I hope you enjoy them. But one more thing about that is
00:00:40,00:00:45,"if you would like something a little bit extra, then you can go to No Such Things A Fish.com"
00:00:45,00:00:51,"and you can find the details of our audio cassette. Now, this is not any normal audio cassette."
00:00:51,00:00:58,You can't put it in your cassette player if you still have one. It is a USB. That USB has all of
00:00:58,00:01:04,"those episodes, like I said, which are now up for free. But it also has an exclusive show that we filmed"
00:01:04,00:01:10,"live in the QI offices, so you can see exactly what our office is like. And, I mean, apart from that,"
00:01:10,00:01:14,"it's a really beautiful little cassette, which is really an awesome thing to have on your shelf and"
00:01:14,00:01:21,"your house. So, enjoy the show. Hope everything's good. Get the cassette, if you fancy it. We'll see you"
00:01:21,00:01:39,"all on the other side. Okay, on with the podcast."
00:01:39,00:01:46,Hello and welcome to another work from home episode of No Such Things A Fish A Weekly Podcast.
00:01:46,00:01:51,"My name is Dan Schreiber. I am sitting here with Anna Chazinski, Andrew Hunter Murray and James"
00:01:51,00:01:56,"Harkin. And once again, we have gathered around our microphones with our four favorite facts from"
00:01:56,00:02:02,"the last seven days. And in no particular order, here we go. Starting with fact number one,"
00:02:02,00:02:10,that's my fact. My fact is NASA fixed its Mars probe by getting it to whack itself with a shovel.
00:02:10,00:02:16,"Did NASA send a shovel with the probe, just in case it needed something to whack itself with,"
00:02:16,00:02:22,like in a cartoon? And did NASA once they had it hitting itself with a shovel? Did it go? Stop
00:02:22,00:02:30,"hitting yourself mate. Stop hitting yourself. So, whack is, as James pointed out to me in an email,"
00:02:30,00:02:36,"not the correct term. Technically, it was a little push. It was a little shove, but it's been reported"
00:02:36,00:02:41,as a whack by most of the media. I wouldn't call it a shove. It was a gentle caress.
00:02:41,00:02:47,Yes. NASA fixed its Mars probe by gently caressing it with a shovel. Stop caressing yourself.
00:02:47,00:02:56,"No, really, stop it. We can see the video. Oh, shit. Okay. Sorry. I'll put that away."
00:02:58,00:03:06,"So, yeah. So, this is the Mars probe that landed late 2018. It was in November, and it's the Mars"
00:03:06,00:03:11,"Insight mission. And the idea is that it's going deep into the interior of Mars, which has never"
00:03:11,00:03:15,"been done before. All previous missions have just looked at the landscape, taken bits of soil."
00:03:15,00:03:20,"This one's drilling down to tell us about the planet. As NASA actually puts it on its own website,"
00:03:20,00:03:25,it's the first mission to give Mars a thorough checkup since the planet formed 4.5 billion years
00:03:25,00:03:31,"ago. So, it's a beautiful little thing that they're trying to test out here. And as they were using"
00:03:31,00:03:36,"the machine that was drilling down, the drill itself, which is called the mole, suddenly got stuck,"
00:03:36,00:03:40,"and they couldn't work out why. And this happened in March of last year. And so, for whole year,"
00:03:40,00:03:45,"they've desperately been trying to work out how we can get this shovel to work again,"
00:03:45,00:03:50,because it's only gone something like 35 centimeters into the ground when it's meant to go
00:03:50,00:03:56,"a full three to five meters roughly. So, they have no idea what to do, and they've been thinking"
00:03:56,00:04:00,a whole year they've had labs set up where they've tested every scenario of what they could do.
00:04:00,00:04:07,"And the answer, finally, that came to them, is just give it a little caress. And it might work"
00:04:07,00:04:11,"and it has. So, it's working again. Yeah, initially, they tried to caress it on the side, didn't they?"
00:04:11,00:04:17,"Because they tried to move it to the side of the hole, which it was drilling. And that might give"
00:04:17,00:04:21,it a bit more purchase. But then they decided they're going to have to push down on it. And the problem
00:04:21,00:04:28,"is that there is a massive tether. So, the mole is attached to the main probe with a piece of wire."
00:04:28,00:04:32,And what they didn't want to do was push that and then damage the tether and then not be able to do
00:04:32,00:04:37,"anything with it. Because if you damage that, then there's no mulling, there's no nothing. And it's"
00:04:37,00:04:44,"also, it's not a drill. It's kind of a drill would spin round, right? Wait, James, did you just say"
00:04:44,00:04:52,"this is not a drill? This is not a drill. So, a drill would spin round. But there's nothing for"
00:04:52,00:04:57,"it to grab onto. So, you can't kind of spin round like a drill. It's kind of an up and down thing."
00:04:57,00:05:02,"So, it kind of pulls itself up and then slams itself down and hopefully makes it a little bit in."
00:05:02,00:05:06,And then it keeps doing that again and again and again and again and hopefully gets about three or
00:05:06,00:05:11,four metres in there. Do you guys know why it's called insights? Because they are citing the inside
00:05:11,00:05:18,"of Mars. I think, well, it's a clever double play on words. So, NASA is just full of these stupid"
00:05:18,00:05:22,"acronyms where it obviously gives stuff a name and then thinks, well, we better attribute,"
00:05:22,00:05:26,"you know, something to each of those initials. So, it's called insights. It stands for"
00:05:26,00:05:32,"interior exploration using seismic investigations, geodesy and heat transport. And it actually had to"
00:05:32,00:05:38,"have a name change. So, it used to be slightly more catchy than that. It was originally called the"
00:05:38,00:05:44,"Geophysical Monitoring Station, which was Gens, but NASA suddenly went, oh, go, we've already got one"
00:05:44,00:05:50,"of those in the working. So, they had to change its whole name so that it didn't coincide with another one."
00:05:50,00:05:57,"Do you know the insiders won an Emmy? That's it. No, before. It won an Emmy for Outstanding"
00:05:57,00:06:04,"Original Interactive Program. So, NASA did some coverage of this landing and of its drilling and"
00:06:04,00:06:10,shuffling and all that kind of stuff. And you could go online and you could interact with the show.
00:06:10,00:06:16,"And it won an Emmy for it. It was a bad year for TV that year, wasn't it? It wasn't that year, yeah."
00:06:16,00:06:22,"And one other thing about insight, and do you know that they have named a rock on Mars?"
00:06:22,00:06:30,"Oh, okay. So, when it landed, when the insight landed, it kind of knocked a little rock. It's only"
00:06:30,00:06:35,"about the size of a golf ball, and it rolled about three feet away. And do you know what they named this rock?"
00:06:35,00:06:44,Okay. They named it after a famous thing. A famous thing. Did they name it after a rock star?
00:06:44,00:06:52,"After some famous people. Oh, the Rolling Stones. Correct. Because it was a Rolling Stone."
00:06:52,00:06:58,"Wow. They've named this one tiny rock of Mars, which is about the size of a golf ball. They've named"
00:06:58,00:07:03,it after the Rolling Stones. It's almost more of an insult naming that after the Rolling Stones.
00:07:03,00:07:08,"It really is. It's not like naming a star or a, you know, a moon or something, is it? And it's named"
00:07:08,00:07:13,after all the Rolling Stones. They haven't picked one. That one rock is now just the full band.
00:07:13,00:07:18,It's called the Rolling Stones Rock. Right. Although they could have called it the Rolling Rock
00:07:18,00:07:22,"or the Rolling Stone, because that's effectively what it is. Yeah. But they've just decided"
00:07:22,00:07:26,Rolling Stones Rock. Did they observe whether the Rolling Stone has gathered any moss?
00:07:27,00:07:33,"Well, we might come to moss later in this show. Oh, it's boilers, boilers."
00:07:33,00:07:40,"Just this was a very, very low-tech solution that they use. The Wacker, Spade, Shovel,"
00:07:40,00:07:43,Moll thing. It's Wacker Molls. They just call it Wacker Moll. We've already got to pay
00:07:43,00:07:49,"caress a Moll, Anna. Sorry. That's a very different game."
00:07:49,00:07:56,"Anyway, this was a very low-tech solution. So there was another one I found during the Apollo 11"
00:07:56,00:08:03,mission. And this was when they'd all got back on the lunar module and they hadn't yet pressed the
00:08:03,00:08:09,button to say take us back to Earth. And Armstrong was wearing his backpack on the module. And it smashed
00:08:09,00:08:14,into the switch. There was one switch they needed to turn on the engine and begin the flight back to earth.
00:08:14,00:08:19,"And he was wearing his big, clunky space backpack. And it just broke the whole switch off."
00:08:19,00:08:25,"Like, it was fine because they just shoved a felt-tipped pen that Buzz Aldrin had been using. Don't"
00:08:25,00:08:32,know why he had a felt-tipped pen on the Apollo 11. But you do. If you watch the moon footage when
00:08:32,00:08:39,"Neil Armstrong turns round, it says dickhead on his back. That's what that was for. He still keeps"
00:08:39,00:08:44,"that pen on him to this day, Buzz Aldrin. He stops. Yeah, he takes it everywhere. He goes, yeah,"
00:08:44,00:08:49,"it's still working. Yeah, it's still got ink. It's still... In many ways, there's more impressive"
00:08:49,00:08:56,"than the Moon lab things. I don't suppose he still uses it. No, he carries it as his lucky charm."
00:08:56,00:09:01,"It was the thing that got them off the moon. Because when we met him, Dan, you did have the word dickhead"
00:09:01,00:09:07,"on your back, but that wasn't him who wrote it. No, I'm still trying to find who did that. It's got"
00:09:07,00:09:11,"similar handwriting to you, James, but I don't want to make any accusations. There's interesting,"
00:09:11,00:09:17,"there's a... I found a fun term for the idea of whacking something to make it work again, which is"
00:09:17,00:09:24,"percussive maintenance. It's a thing that actually is recommended by so many different people,"
00:09:24,00:09:29,people who work in the electronics industry. There was a whole thing about the fact that if a
00:09:29,00:09:34,"soldiered connection needed to reconnect, sometimes it would lose its connection. Just by whacking it,"
00:09:34,00:09:40,you could make it reconnect. There's been so many examples of percussive maintenance throughout
00:09:40,00:09:46,the years in NASA Territory Skylab when that went up. There was a bit of a problem on the outside
00:09:46,00:09:50,of it and the way that the astronauts fixed that was during a spacewalk was to hit it and that made
00:09:50,00:09:56,"it work again, so that was very useful. But then there was also this great airplane called the Blackbird,"
00:09:56,00:10:03,"the SR-71 Blackbird. Have you guys heard of this? This is a bird. Sorry, this is a plane. No, it's"
00:10:03,00:10:12,"Superman. So this is a plane that flew so high and fast that when it was up there, the body of"
00:10:12,00:10:22,the plane would stretch because of the materials would stretch. Absolutely. Can I just repeat what you
00:10:22,00:10:28,just said? You said so it went so fast that the body would stretch because the body would stretch.
00:10:28,00:10:34,I didn't expect for this to get picked up. I don't know where to go from here. That was not an
00:10:34,00:10:39,"acceptable explanation. Dan, is it the case that the pilots will be sitting at the controls and"
00:10:39,00:10:44,"then suddenly they go, ""Whoa!"" And then they'll be sitting at the third row. Is it the people who are on"
00:10:44,00:10:50,"the plane are going, ""I've got a lot more legroom than I used to."" Well, I thought that was a"
00:10:50,00:10:56,"thing with planes that when you go to a certain altitude, materials, construction, shrink, I thought"
00:10:56,00:11:01,that was a classic thing. You've got to collect more information on it in order to elucidate it for
00:11:01,00:11:07,"the rest of us who don't know about it. Well, let's imagine that let's just accept that this"
00:11:07,00:11:12,"grew a trunk. No, we're not accepting it. Okay. Well, I'm ready to accept it. Come on. Let's accept"
00:11:12,00:11:17,"that this thing is stretched, like, stretch Armstrong. So the idea was that they built a plane"
00:11:17,00:11:22,whereby the panels didn't necessarily meet on the ground. There was a gap between them so that when
00:11:22,00:11:26,"it got to that height and it stretched, they would lock into each other and then it could continue"
00:11:26,00:11:32,"flying in perfect harmony at that height. When it landed back on the ground, they would then"
00:11:32,00:11:37,"bash it back into shape of making those gaps again for the next flight. Hang on, I'm a bit"
00:11:37,00:11:43,"confused now about how if the panels didn't meet on the ground, and then it stretched apart. It's a good,"
00:11:43,00:11:49,"I know what you're going to say, yeah, it's a good question. Are you sure it didn't squash? It feels like,"
00:11:49,00:11:54,"because it would be so cold up there, because it's a lot colder in the sky, it feels like the materials"
00:11:54,00:12:02,"would shrink. Yeah, it's another good point. Well, it sounds like an amazing plane. It sounds like"
00:12:02,00:12:08,"a hell of a plane. I'm sorry, I didn't get to fly. You know how things get faster than the speed of"
00:12:08,00:12:14,light? Maybe it's that thing? Maybe it's the Einstein thing. I can only thank you all for trying to
00:12:14,00:12:21,help me out with it. I don't think we're going to get anywhere constructive. Did you know there's a
00:12:21,00:12:30,"guerrilla suit on the ISS? What for? For fun. Yeah, they just wear it sometimes on the ISS."
00:12:30,00:12:34,Isn't that the least practical thing you've ever heard of being sent up there? And so it's not
00:12:34,00:12:42,sort of back up space suit. They run out of space suit. Imagine the pictures coming from the next time
00:12:42,00:12:48,"that people go on the moon, and you got three of them in space suits. Some of them guys like"
00:12:48,00:12:53,"Arthur Faxx, I don't know how to do the guerrilla suit, I'm like, we're going to enjoy the short show."
00:12:55,00:13:02,"In 2013, there was a hole in the ISS, and it was probably caused by a tiny micro meter, right?"
00:13:02,00:13:09,"The hole was just a few millimeters to a few centimeters wide, and they plugged it using an"
00:13:09,00:13:15,astronaut's thumb. So did the astronaut have to stay next to the wall for the rest of the mission? He's
00:13:15,00:13:24,"still there. He's still there, yeah. No, they cut his thumb off, no, eventually use some sealant,"
00:13:24,00:13:29,"but just until they managed to get their correct tools there, he had to stand there with his thumb in the"
00:13:29,00:13:34,die. Wow. That's great. Very cool. What's the story about the Netherlands dying in the person
00:13:34,00:13:38,who shoved their thumb in it to stop the whole country flooding? That's what you just said is the
00:13:38,00:13:44,"whole story. That's it. That's the story. It was well told, I thought. Can I just talk about one more"
00:13:44,00:13:50,low fine NASA fix? It's one of the best. It's in 2012 when the ISS was repaired with the toothbrush.
00:13:51,00:13:56,"So yeah, this was that they they have four units on the outside that power the ISS and they're"
00:13:56,00:14:02,"covered in solar panels, and one of them broke. And so the space space people, the what do you call them?"
00:14:02,00:14:09,"Astronauts. The astronauts had to climb outside to fix it, but the bolt was stuck because it gathered"
00:14:09,00:14:13,"so much space dust that they couldn't quite get a handle on the bolt properly, and they didn't"
00:14:13,00:14:17,"have to get rid of the space dust. They were like, well, we need some sort of little kind of brush,"
00:14:17,00:14:21,"sort of hard stiff, and they use a toothbrush, and I don't know how they decided which astronaut"
00:14:21,00:14:26,"sacrifice their toothbrush, the sake of this bolt, but they brushed all the dust off. And then after"
00:14:26,00:14:30,"that, you're sort of brushing your teeth with space dust, which is probably, it's probably worth"
00:14:30,00:14:35,the sacrifice. It feels like it would be more abrasive than a normal toothbrush. Yeah.
00:14:35,00:14:40,Might help you brushing your teeth with space dust. It could be the new thing. Coldgate might be about
00:14:40,00:14:45,"to release the next space dust and toothpaste. Here's another tip. If you have a gap in your teeth,"
00:14:45,00:14:55,"just go up to very high altitude. Okay, it is time for fact number two, and that is James."
00:14:55,00:15:01,"Okay, my fact this week is that we don't know what the Greek philosopher Plato's real name was."
00:15:01,00:15:11,"Plato was his wrestling nickname. So this is from historian Diogenes Laertius, who wrote a lot about"
00:15:11,00:15:17,"Plato, and he said that his name came from broad shoulder, which is what Plato means, and that it was"
00:15:17,00:15:22,"due to his physique, because he had big muscles. He was known as being a wrestler. He apparently"
00:15:22,00:15:29,competed at the Ismian Games. And we don't really know what his actual first name is. According to
00:15:29,00:15:34,"Diogenes Laertius, it might have been Aristocles, which means best reputation, but we don't really"
00:15:34,00:15:40,"have much historical evidence for that. So most people think that probably isn't true, but we do"
00:15:40,00:15:46,think that probably he got his name Plato because he was broad-shouldered. So I read there's three
00:15:46,00:15:51,"possibilities for why he got called Plato. In that same category, one was broad-shoulders,"
00:15:51,00:15:57,"one was possibly breadth of eloquence, but my favorite one is that he had a massive forehead."
00:15:57,00:16:03,"That's the third one. Did he? That's supposedly had a very wide forehead, and that might have been"
00:16:03,00:16:08,"why he got called that. The thing he took part in sounds really intense, this thing called the"
00:16:08,00:16:16,"Pancrataion, which is it's a kind of fighting where you can do everything pretty much, except"
00:16:16,00:16:22,"biting people and gouging out their eyes. It's a bit like Mix Martial Arts, and it's so violent"
00:16:22,00:16:27,"that when the Olympics came back, it was the only ancient Olympic event that was not brought back."
00:16:27,00:16:33,"And the Archbishop of Leon said, ""We allow all events to be reinstated except Pancrataion."""
00:16:33,00:16:39,And that's what Plato was doing. He was doing the ultra-violent thing. Although he was doing the least
00:16:39,00:16:46,"violent of this admittedly extremely violent practice, wasn't he? He was up there, but not quite peak."
00:16:46,00:16:53,"Boxing was maybe the worst, and then the wrestling was seen as the wimp settlement of Pancrataion, I think."
00:16:53,00:16:58,"But you still had people like the other Nicknick wrestling nickname I found was Mr. Fingertips,"
00:16:58,00:17:04,"who was a four-century BC wrestler in the Pancrataion, and he was called Mr. Fingertips because his"
00:17:04,00:17:09,"strategy was every time a game started, he'd bend the opponent's fingers back until they snapped,"
00:17:09,00:17:15,and then that usually would mean that they caved immediately. Wow. That is a pretty basic move in
00:17:15,00:17:22,"wrestling, isn't it? It's all the one ahead of pulling someone's hair, or like kneeling down behind"
00:17:22,00:17:26,"them and then getting someone to push them over. I don't know, it's pretty good. If you're doing a"
00:17:26,00:17:31,"thumb war and you immediately break your opponent's thumb, then the thumb war is one of that point. I"
00:17:31,00:17:36,"don't know. I always think bending people's fingers back is like a Chinese bird. It's a bit cheap,"
00:17:36,00:17:42,you mean? It's not fair play. It's a bit playgroundy. Yeah. It's a seminal move in modern-day
00:17:42,00:17:48,"WWF and WWE wrestling. What, breaking someone's fingers, holding their hands and gripping them"
00:17:48,00:17:54,"and bending them, it can lead to 10 minutes. Honestly, it's a biggie in the world of wrestling."
00:17:54,00:18:00,"Is that serious, Stan? Yeah, yeah. It's a big... They've burned each other's fingers back."
00:18:00,00:18:05,"Yeah, yeah, it's a move that you see a lot. It's almost a way of the wrestlers during a big match,"
00:18:05,00:18:11,"getting their breath back together. It's their break moment, but they really bring the theatrics."
00:18:11,00:18:15,It just makes it look like you're doing one of these country dances where someone skips underneath
00:18:15,00:18:23,"the arch there. I wonder if, you know, modern-day boxing and so on, half of the whole thing is the"
00:18:23,00:18:28,"smack talk that happens, you know, the taunting and so on. I'm just wondering what Plato's smack talk"
00:18:28,00:18:33,"would be like, because he would dish out new philosophical ideas that would crush your whole"
00:18:33,00:18:39,understanding of the earth. How could you fight once you've been told about existence in your place
00:18:39,00:18:44,in the universe? I don't know. I think it's particularly easy to punch that guy in the face to be honest.
00:18:44,00:18:51,He might have shouted that you were a featherless biped. That was one of his human slams.
00:18:51,00:18:58,"That was how he defined man, and I think it was sort of saying we're really no different from"
00:18:58,00:19:03,"creatures in a lot of ways, but then he came up against Diogenes the cynic, who said that's a"
00:19:03,00:19:09,"ridiculous way to define man, and he brought to Plato a live chicken and plucked it in front of his"
00:19:09,00:19:15,"very eyes. Wait, sorry, he plucked the chicken live, because if so, Diogenes has a lot of questions to"
00:19:15,00:19:20,answer. I think it's better than killing a chicken just in order to pluck it to make a philosophical point.
00:19:20,00:19:27,"I think it's tough to pluck a live chicken. I think that's a real skill. I've never tried,"
00:19:27,00:19:32,"but frankly, he should have been called Diogenes the optimist if he thought he was going to get away."
00:19:32,00:19:39,"Maybe he was a wrestler too and got it in a headlock or something. That's Plato held out,"
00:19:39,00:19:46,but Plato was forced to amend his definition of man to a featherless biped with broad flat nails.
00:19:48,00:19:53,That distinguishes us from the chicken. Does that mean like finger nails and toenails and stuff?
00:19:53,00:19:57,"It just means basically, I think he looked for the first thing that we have that chicken doesn't."
00:19:57,00:20:01,Quite a lot to pick from. He went for the nails. But he went for the chickens have got nails.
00:20:01,00:20:05,"But they don't know. They've got bendy-like questions. Oh yeah, that's true, yeah. They're not"
00:20:05,00:20:10,"flat. Wow, it feels like a bit of a reach from Plato at that point. But here's what I'm thinking,"
00:20:10,00:20:15,"right? He said broad flat nails. Plato means broad. We don't know where the broad bit comes from,"
00:20:15,00:20:23,maybe he had extremely broad nails. He just had really flat fingers. Maybe that's where he got his
00:20:23,00:20:29,"nails. Just the first thing you noticed about him. Diogenes, if Diogenes was taking the piss out of"
00:20:29,00:20:35,"you, I think that's pretty bad because he lived in a barrel. Didn't he? Yeah, he did. If someone's"
00:20:35,00:20:38,"coming up to you taking the piss and it's like, mate, you live in a barrel. He lives in a barrel."
00:20:38,00:20:44,"And he's a cynic. Was he Oscar the Grouch? Who's this? He basically, oh my god, he basically was."
00:20:45,00:20:49,I think Oscar the Grouch is based on him. I think he was just trying to show the vanity of
00:20:49,00:20:53,"human vanity, you know. Yeah, he lived in a jar to tell humans that they were all"
00:20:53,00:20:58,"dickheads. Wait, a jar or a barrel? Because I think a jar is worse. A jar of smaller, normally."
00:20:58,00:21:02,"Yeah. It's called a jar usually, but I think it was quite a large one. I don't think he squeezed"
00:21:02,00:21:10,"himself into like a jam jar. Yeah. Well, he also, he masturbated in his barrel. Oh no."
00:21:10,00:21:14,"Well, I hope it wasn't a jar then because that would be a hell of a view to everyone passing by."
00:21:14,00:21:18,"People didn't find that amusing and he used to defecate in theatres and stuff, didn't he?"
00:21:18,00:21:25,"Wait, he was trying to excuse society, I think, is the point. I might be wrong about this because I"
00:21:25,00:21:28,"don't know much about diabetes, but I think that's what he was trying to do. And he was trying to go"
00:21:28,00:21:34,"and get societal norms. Yeah. And he lived in a barrel, but then he still needed to masturbate because"
00:21:34,00:21:38,"he was, you know, he had urges and he couldn't leave his barrel. So we had to do it in a barrel, but"
00:21:38,00:21:43,"people didn't like it very much. Damn, why did you say just that it was so, it was so particularly"
00:21:43,00:21:48,"bad to masturbate in the jar. Well, your barrel, no one's going to see inside. You can do that in private"
00:21:48,00:21:55,"in your barrel. Your jar, your David Blaining it. People are going to come and visit to see what you're"
00:21:55,00:22:00,"up to. Sure, did David Blaine do that? If I'd known that, I would have watched his whole, you know,"
00:22:00,00:22:05,stuck in a box gig. I'm not sure if he did. Did he leave the jar to go into the theatre to have a poo?
00:22:05,00:22:12,"Or did he have the jar taken into the theatre? Well, like roll it along like a hamster wheel."
00:22:12,00:22:18,Yeah. And then sort of poo out of the end of it. I think this might have been at two different stages
00:22:18,00:22:26,of his life. I think he might have been past his barrel years. So he's pooing in the fit of years.
00:22:26,00:22:32,"You've got to keep it fresh for people, haven't you? You've got to keep sticking up. He famously,"
00:22:32,00:22:38,"the thing about masturbating was he always said it because I think he begged for food, baby."
00:22:38,00:22:44,"And yeah, he said it'd be better if I could satisfy my hunger by rubbing my belly in the same way"
00:22:44,00:22:51,that I satisfy my sexual needs by rubbing my genitals. That was his saying. Wow. That was his catchphrase.
00:22:51,00:22:57,Pretty bold decision by the Sesame Street writers. The phase Oscar the Grinch on his gun.
00:23:01,00:23:09,There are a lot of unedited scenes in that. He actually is quite interesting. He gave an explanation
00:23:09,00:23:14,"for the origin of the word cynic, diogenes. So someone said why do they call you diogenes the cynic?"
00:23:14,00:23:18,And it meant diogenes the dog-like as it's from the same river. It's like canine.
00:23:18,00:23:21,Right. And I think he said. So just do a poo wherever I want.
00:23:21,00:23:29,"I just shit everywhere. No, he said it's because I fall upon those who give me"
00:23:29,00:23:34,"anything and bark at those who give me nothing. That cynicism, that's where that's coming from,"
00:23:34,00:23:36,according to him. That's interesting.
00:23:36,00:23:44,"Okay, it is time for fact number three and that is Andy. My fact is that the first ever"
00:23:44,00:23:49,internal combustion engine was partially powered by explosive moss.
00:23:49,00:23:57,Wow. Oh god. Now people who listen to his podcast might not know about
00:23:57,00:24:02,add these obsession with moss because we've never let him do a moss fight before.
00:24:02,00:24:06,"But for one of our books, was it the last book we did or the one before?"
00:24:06,00:24:13,It was the one before. Yeah. Book of the year 2018 maybe. We had an article on club moss and it was
00:24:13,00:24:17,and these absolute fave. It was the longest article in the book at the time of submission
00:24:17,00:24:25,and weirdly it was the shortest but it actually made it to print. So revenge time. So this is an
00:24:25,00:24:30,internal combustion engine powered by small internal explosions and the thing which provided
00:24:30,00:24:39,the explosions was this moss. The machine was called the pyreon of four and it was patented in 1807
00:24:39,00:24:45,which I find unbelievably early as in the patent was signed by Napoleon for this machine.
00:24:45,00:24:55,And it was patented by a French inventor called Nissefore Niepse and this machine ran
00:24:55,00:25:01,a boat. The engine was attached to a boat and it was full of lycopodium dust which was from a
00:25:01,00:25:08,particular species of club moss and it's very explosive this stuff because it has lots of surface
00:25:08,00:25:15,area and it's 50% fat so it goes bang quite readily when it's supposed to flame and there was a boat
00:25:15,00:25:21,going around up and down rivers. That's incredible. I didn't look into this specific one and it
00:25:21,00:25:28,"actually powered a boat but I think it was quite a small boat wasn't it? It wasn't a huge boat,"
00:25:28,00:25:33,was it? Was it on a model boating pond? It wasn't a model boat. It was not because I did read
00:25:33,00:25:38,one place that said it was a toy boat but I couldn't tell whether it was or not. I mean all boats are toy
00:25:38,00:25:48,boats if you're a giant. Okay it wasn't a massive boat. I think let's go that far. But it wasn't
00:25:48,00:25:54,only a centimetre long. It was somewhere in between the two. It was somewhere in between a centimetre
00:25:54,00:26:00,at the Titanic. Yeah exactly. That was it. It clarified that for me. Thank you. It was pretty clever
00:26:00,00:26:04,how it worked though wasn't it because it would use the energy from this combustion engine and it
00:26:04,00:26:09,would suck water in from the front and push it out of the back and then it would use that movement
00:26:09,00:26:16,"to power it forward. Yeah it was very clever. And just on a little tangent, Niepse, the inventor,"
00:26:16,00:26:22,it was him and his brother who did it. Niepse is also the man who produced one of the first ever
00:26:22,00:26:28,photographic images 20 years later. Imagine being at the beginning of those two technologies.
00:26:28,00:26:34,Did he use the photographic flash in its early days then wasn't it and they used all sorts of
00:26:34,00:26:38,explosives and I think they used this in photography and flash photography and I wonder if he
00:26:38,00:26:44,used that. Was he a one-trick pony and he only ever used his club monster? I don't know. I think his
00:26:44,00:26:50,photography being as it was the very very first one that ever existed was before flashes to be honest.
00:26:50,00:26:58,"The first one that he did, it was called The View From The Window at Legra and it was in 1826"
00:26:58,00:27:05,"and the exposure time was eight hours so I think flash would have helped much in that case. Don't blink,"
00:27:05,00:27:12,don't blink. And the light was a problem because they didn't have flashes but they used the light
00:27:12,00:27:17,of the sun but obviously the sun is not in the same place for eight hours and so if you look at this
00:27:17,00:27:25,picture it looks a bit like a charcoal etching to be honest. It's not 4K but you can see the sunlight
00:27:25,00:27:30,on the left hand side and the right hand side because of the amount of time it took to expose.
00:27:30,00:27:37,Can I just say about club monster quickly? I just want to formally apologise Andy. It's amazing.
00:27:37,00:27:43,"Thank you. Thank you. I watched an amazing video by a buddy of ours, Mutual Body of the podcast Steve"
00:27:43,00:27:50,"Mold from the Festival of Spoken Nerd where he has powder, a powdered version of it and showing"
00:27:50,00:27:57,just how hydrophobic it is. So the idea is that you could dip your hand into a big body of water
00:27:57,00:28:02,if you have the powder just laying on top of the surface area and come back out your hand will be
00:28:02,00:28:06,sort of latexed a bit. It looks like you've gone marigold glove but you'll have a completely dry
00:28:06,00:28:11,hand that you can powder off. I mean it's an extraordinary substance. I've never heard of that before.
00:28:11,00:28:17,And you can set fire to water using it. It's so extremely flammable and it coats the water
00:28:17,00:28:24,without being absorbed by it so you can sort of pour water covered in club moss spores out of a jar
00:28:24,00:28:30,and then set fire to it and it looks pretty cool. There are lots of uses so it was as Anna said it was
00:28:30,00:28:37,used for flash powder for photographers before they invented flash bulbs. It was also used to coat
00:28:37,00:28:44,suppositories. I'm not exactly sure why. Is it the same reason as your hydrophobic thing as in
00:28:44,00:28:49,"basically you know what I've been to stick to it basically? Yes, in fact it would be that because"
00:28:49,00:28:54,it was also used as a coating for condoms then because it was used specifically to stop the latex
00:28:54,00:29:00,and condoms from sticking to the rest of the condom. This is before we had modern condoms.
00:29:00,00:29:06,"You said condoms a lot of time in that sense. It felt very, felt very racy saying that all those times."
00:29:06,00:29:12,I suppose the problem is basically you're using spores and it's not a good idea to put spores
00:29:12,00:29:19,in your vagina or anus. Is that in case you give birth just sort of a moss human hybrid?
00:29:19,00:29:28,"No, it's in case it goes off like a flash bulb. It's balloons inside you and that actually is where"
00:29:28,00:29:34,the term flashing used to come from because women used to go around parks and then open their big
00:29:34,00:29:40,"raincoats and it would be like a camera flash. That's incredible. Amazing etymology, I never knew that."
00:29:40,00:29:44,"I'm not, I'm not buying it. I knew you were trying to make me believe that and I'm not buying it."
00:29:44,00:29:49,"No, Dan, it's true. It's true. Dojo needs the cynic used to stick his bum out of the barrel and"
00:29:49,00:29:55,"you go, hey, look at this bang. No, but yeah, James, you're absolutely right. Sticking spores in"
00:29:55,00:30:01,"yourself is a bad idea, but this moss was even used to coat surgical gloves. So you would literally"
00:30:01,00:30:06,"have it decide to go in the internal organ to people. But you wouldn't need the glove, right? If you"
00:30:06,00:30:12,"were a doctor doing a finger at the bum check, you would just need to coat one finger in this club"
00:30:12,00:30:20,"moss and you say, well, you're saving four unused fingers of a glove. So, you know, that's handy."
00:30:20,00:30:25,"From what you're saying, it sounds like if you're a doctor, then you could use a glove five times"
00:30:25,00:30:30,"in five different bottoms because you got five fingers. Is that, is that what you're saying? That's"
00:30:30,00:30:35,"literally what I'm saying. Yeah. Oh, could you say no offense, mate. Honestly, it's just I only"
00:30:35,00:30:40,have the middle finger left. I only have the thong left. I know I've got broad nails.
00:30:40,00:30:50,They call me play. Do you know some people who like moss are the Japanese?
00:30:51,00:30:56,Yes. My Japanese friend is obsessed with it. Is that true data point? Yeah. Yeah. She goes around
00:30:56,00:31:00,"collecting it. That's so interesting because I read this on the internet and I thought, if I say"
00:31:00,00:31:05,there's probably lots of Japanese people right in as they were not obsessed with moss. So I'm so glad
00:31:05,00:31:11,that we have at least one datum. But there was a book written in 2011 called moss is my dear friends
00:31:11,00:31:18,"and it sell 40,000 copies in Japan. And these days you can get moss themed drinks and you can get"
00:31:19,00:31:24,"like a ring which has moss in it. So instead of like a diamond, it sprouts out a little bit moss."
00:31:24,00:31:31,And actually the Japanese national anthem contains the word moss. Does it? It genuinely does.
00:31:31,00:31:37,"It goes, ""May your world go on for thousands of years until pebbles merge into one giant rock"
00:31:37,00:31:43,"that's covered with moss."" That's great. It probably sounds better in the original language."
00:31:43,00:31:49,"I do think so, yeah. So moss, actual moss, which is a club moss is an actual moss,"
00:31:49,00:31:55,but actual moss is a real lifesaver. So it was used a lot in the First World War on wounds because
00:31:55,00:31:59,"they ran out of bandages. So many people were getting injured. A lot of exposed flesh, a lot of stuff"
00:31:59,00:32:05,"was rotting and they suddenly realized they could stuff a wound with moss. And first of all, it's"
00:32:05,00:32:10,"incredibly good at absorbing liquid. So if you're bleeding, it's very good at absorbing that. It can"
00:32:10,00:32:17,absorb 22 times its own weight in liquid. It's twice as absorbed of as cotton. And it's because 90%
00:32:17,00:32:21,of the cells in moss are dead. So they're just like water bottles waiting there to be filled.
00:32:21,00:32:26,"And also it makes the environment around it really acidic, which makes it sterilizing. So it also"
00:32:26,00:32:32,"sterilizes wounds. So if you get a little soft, shove some moss in it. I think is it a very specific kind"
00:32:32,00:32:38,"of moss that they use. I can use any old, I can't use any old moss. It's fagnum moss, isn't it? Yeah."
00:32:38,00:32:43,Fagnum's awesome. They used to use it for diapers as well. Ancient cultures would put it sort of
00:32:43,00:32:49,"in a bag like casing and put it around the children. So when they went to the toilet, acted the same."
00:32:49,00:32:52,"It's another reason why Diogenes kept it in his barrel, isn't it?"
00:32:52,00:32:59,"Fagnum is really good. So there are about 380 species. It's a whole genus, it's fagnum moss."
00:32:59,00:33:04,"But in the first world war, they had to harvest it from peat bogs because peat bogs are largely"
00:33:04,00:33:13,"fagnum moss basically. And by the end of 1916, they were making a million moss dressings every single month."
00:33:13,00:33:17,"Wow. So it's a huge endeavor to create all that stuff. Yeah, yeah."
00:33:17,00:33:23,It's fagnum is great. Fagnum is the main ingredient of peat and that is... What's your favourite? And
00:33:23,00:33:29,is it fagnum moss or club moss or just general mosses in general? I think more cake moss. It's fagnum.
00:33:29,00:33:35,It's not cake moss. I think it's fagnum. Imagine cake moss. Cake moss is your third favourite moss
00:33:35,00:33:42,I'm including moss from the IT crowd. I think cake is my fourth favourite moss. Cake doesn't even
00:33:42,00:33:51,"list. Okay, it's time for our final fact of the show and that is Chazinsky. My favorite this week is"
00:33:51,00:33:58,that we have arches in our feet for the same reason that we fold slices of peata if we do that.
00:33:58,00:34:05,"Is it because feet are so delicious? The cheesy, they're cheesy. We don't want to spill any of the"
00:34:05,00:34:13,cheese. It's to stop. The cheese falling off. Yeah. This is a thing that Americans do a bit more than
00:34:13,00:34:17,I think. The peats are folding. I think maybe because they have bigger slices. So you fold a slice of
00:34:17,00:34:24,pizza and it makes it stronger and a new study has just been done into foot arches and it's been
00:34:24,00:34:29,discovered that this is the reason for one of the arches in our feet and it's actually the lesser
00:34:29,00:34:35,appreciated arch. So this study is about you've got the big attention seeking arch right which is
00:34:35,00:34:41,the longitudinal arch which runs from front to back and then you've got the transverse arch
00:34:41,00:34:45,which runs the width of your foot and you can really see the transverse arch when you look at the
00:34:45,00:34:51,top of your foot. It's the lump on the top of your foot and essentially they've looked at that
00:34:51,00:34:55,and they applied lots of pressure to it. These scientists they got where do they got cadavers
00:34:55,00:35:00,and they put weights on them and then they cut the transverse arch to see what kind of weight they
00:35:00,00:35:06,could hold comparatively and they found that the stiffness of a foot is reduced by 40% when you cut
00:35:06,00:35:15,"that transverse arch. So it's therefore stiffness. What is an arch made of? It's bone ligament,"
00:35:15,00:35:22,"tendony, all that shit. The usual shit that the body is made of. Okay. That's really helpful."
00:35:22,00:35:29,Thanks Dr. Arna. Well you know it's been a bone and ligament. The foot doesn't have a quarter of
00:35:29,00:35:34,the bones in your body. Both your feet combined. Have a quarter of the body's bones. So it's really
00:35:34,00:35:37,really important that I've feted this stiff. It's one of the things that really distinguishes us from
00:35:37,00:35:44,other great apes is that we have the arches in our foot generally which allow us to be bipedal
00:35:44,00:35:49,and to walk and run particularly over really long distances. So if you look at the feet of
00:35:49,00:35:54,chimps then they're completely flat and that means that they can grab onto trees and stuff like that
00:35:54,00:36:00,but they cannot run a marathon. So in your face chimps. Well I know what you're saying about in your
00:36:00,00:36:04,face chimps but what I was thinking is what would you rather have feet that let you climb a tree or
00:36:04,00:36:11,feet that let you run a marathon. It depends on what you're trying to escape from. Yeah. If you're
00:36:11,00:36:17,trying to escape from Polarachlif. Probably climbing a tree. If you're trying to escape from
00:36:17,00:36:23,"Tarzan. Exactly. He probably beat you at a marathon as well. Yeah. Yeah, he definitely won. But actually"
00:36:23,00:36:31,I think it doesn't matter whether you've got this thing or not. So there was a study of people who
00:36:31,00:36:37,"visited the Boston Museum of Science and they studied all of their feet and they found that some,"
00:36:37,00:36:42,"I know, one of weird gig researchers just to hang around the museum and say hey can I give you a"
00:36:42,00:36:50,feed. But they found that some people had a mid-tasal break. Okay. And what that means is that the middle
00:36:50,00:36:56,of the foot bends quite easily as you push yourself off the ground. So one in 13 people has weird
00:36:56,00:37:02,folding ape-like feet. And if you have this and you walk on a beach you might see there's more of
00:37:02,00:37:06,a ridge in the middle portion of your footprint which shows that that's where your foot basically
00:37:06,00:37:12,folds as you step. And most people don't know they've got this which is very exciting. I think it
00:37:12,00:37:17,"would matter if you were doing a marathon every day. Yeah, that's true. If you're kind of doing a lot"
00:37:17,00:37:22,"of long distance running it would probably start to hurt quite a lot. Yeah, that's, yeah. Although"
00:37:22,00:37:25,it hurts all the time anyway if you do lots of long distance running so you probably wouldn't notice.
00:37:25,00:37:30,That's fair enough. And like kind of says though the arch is a for stiffness. So if you didn't have an
00:37:30,00:37:37,arch going transversely so going from left to right and you had flat feet then you wouldn't have
00:37:37,00:37:41,any stiffness in your feet at all and they'd just be like floppy bits of cardboard. Yeah. That would
00:37:41,00:37:48,"be a problem. Yeah, that's true. So Anna, also, if this applies to American pizzas which are much longer"
00:37:48,00:37:53,"than say a British pizza, if you have smaller feet do you need the arch as much? I guess you need"
00:37:53,00:37:59,them less because you're bearing less weight. I mean it would be proportional. And it's actually a
00:37:59,00:38:03,thing called Gaussian curvature which is something that we briefly discussed years ago on the show
00:38:03,00:38:09,when we were talking about corrugated iron and it's the amazing effect that you'll all remember that
00:38:09,00:38:16,classic episode. I think it was in the 60s so we've just put a load of episodes back up for free and
00:38:16,00:38:23,I think it's one of those. It is. So I will be good news guys. It was an absolute classic of the genre.
00:38:23,00:38:28,I highly recommend the corrugated iron session and we talk partly about how the shape of that makes
00:38:28,00:38:34,it stronger and it's the same reason that for instance you can't crack an egg if you squeeze it
00:38:34,00:38:43,really hard and this is the thing that this guy called. I mean I think I can. I can. You can't. I can.
00:38:43,00:38:51,"You can't. Look, I haven't seen an egg for weeks. I can't at the moment. I have an egg downstairs."
00:38:51,00:38:56,Can I run down and get it? Yeah. Don't talk me on camera by breaking one of your few available
00:38:56,00:39:01,stocks of eggs. You won't be able to break it. You can break it if you shove your thumb into it but if
00:39:01,00:39:05,"you just squeeze it. If I just squeeze it, you will break it. Should I genuinely do it or should we"
00:39:05,00:39:09,forget it and just move on? I mean it's an enormous waste of time because you won't be able to do it
00:39:09,00:39:12,or you'll cheat and shove your thumb in or bang it against your mouth. I'm not going to cheat.
00:39:12,00:39:17,"And then you'll be able to become an egg. That's win-win, isn't it? It's win-win, you should do it."
00:39:17,00:39:22,You should put your face beneath it so that if you end up with egg on your face you actually won't
00:39:22,00:39:30,"end up with egg on your face. If you do manage to do this at home, try it if you want as long as you"
00:39:30,00:39:35,"don't waste food. But if you've got an egg that's gone after it, sometimes you'll get an egg which"
00:39:35,00:39:40,"has got some kind of imperfections in it and it is possible if your egg is not, you know, if there's"
00:39:40,00:39:46,problem with your egg. Here's the caveat. There we go. But most of the time it is impossible to break
00:39:46,00:39:52,an egg just by squeezing it. It is cool. Although weirdly I read that a way of really emphasising the
00:39:52,00:39:57,"Gaussian curvature, the strength of it is to have a hyperbolic paraboloid which is basically having"
00:39:57,00:40:01,"something that's curved in two directions, a bit like our foot. And something that uses that is power"
00:40:01,00:40:07,"stations. So you know if you look at power station, it's curved or the cooling tower. A cooling tower,"
00:40:07,00:40:14,yeah. It's sort of doubly curved because it's rounded but it's also got that curve going in.
00:40:14,00:40:19,"It's the opposite of what we have on our feet. So in your feet, your curves are both going in"
00:40:19,00:40:24,"the same direction. Good point. So if you turn your toes in, then it's bending in the same way that"
00:40:24,00:40:30,the left to right of your foot goes. I'm not explaining this very well. But it's more like a
00:40:30,00:40:36,"pringle. If you think of a pringle, it kind of from top to bottom, it curves one way and then from left"
00:40:36,00:40:40,"to right, it curves the other way. That's why it's impossible to break a pringle if you hold it in"
00:40:40,00:40:46,your hand and squeeze. I've tried it. I can't do it. This is my problem. This is my problem with
00:40:46,00:40:52,hyperbolic paraboloids. It's always used as the example. They go and pringles use this technology as
00:40:52,00:40:57,"well. And it's like, what are you talking about? The entire selling point in pringles is that you"
00:40:57,00:41:02,"can crunch them. They wouldn't be nearly as crunchy if they were flat. Oh, yeah. That'll be disgusting."
00:41:02,00:41:09,I would hate to eat a flat pringle genuinely. Really? Yeah. That sounds like an off. It just
00:41:09,00:41:16,"sounds creepy, doesn't it? You know what's even stronger? If you have a corrugated iron style"
00:41:16,00:41:21,"crisp, like a kai's kind of thing, a corrugated crisp, now that's a strong crisp. I can jump up and"
00:41:21,00:41:29,down on one of those things for days and get nowhere. Have you guys heard of Douglas Morson? No. I was
00:41:29,00:41:34,just studying things about the souls of the feet. So he was an Antarctic explorer when he wasn't
00:41:34,00:41:41,"Antarctic. He was Australian actually, but he was exploring the Antarctic in 1912. And he wasn't"
00:41:41,00:41:46,"bothering with the poll. He was doing the most ambitious exploration of Antarctica ever. You know,"
00:41:46,00:41:52,"thousands or hundreds of miles, at least, of Antarctica's very desert interior. He was trying to,"
00:41:52,00:41:58,"you know, explore and map it. Anyway, on his way back, with a hundred miles to go, his partner had"
00:41:58,00:42:07,died. He discovered that the souls of his feet had completely detached from the foot above genuinely.
00:42:07,00:42:14,I don't think is that possible? There was blood and pus spurting out and just all the skin of the
00:42:14,00:42:19,"souls of his feet had come off. So somewhere there's an actual footprint laying in the snow? Well,"
00:42:19,00:42:26,what he had to do was he had to tape the dead souls back onto his feet and put six pairs of socks on
00:42:26,00:42:31,"and then keep walking. Oh, wow. Well, anyway, he survived. He survived and he became a national hero and"
00:42:31,00:42:37,"he left another 46 years. So the story has a happy ending in some senses. He was lost for ages,"
00:42:37,00:42:41,wasn't he? Wasn't he away for years? And his wife married someone else and then he returned
00:42:41,00:42:46,to up 12 years later and... That's the dishears you're talking about. That's sorry.
00:42:46,00:42:49,"Surely when he came back, he would be like an inch shorter than when he left."
00:42:49,00:42:57,"I would know my husband anyway and he was five, seven, ten, your five foot nine and a half."
00:42:57,00:43:04,"So most of them on feet? Yes, please, yeah. Our feet are just really good. I think we should be more"
00:43:04,00:43:10,"proud of our feet and I think we should just bound trainers. This is, I've sort of been brainwashed"
00:43:10,00:43:15,because there was that study that was quite famous in 2004 by that harbour professor and then a book
00:43:15,00:43:20,"based on it called Born to Run, which is a really good book but sort of about how we are, we're born to"
00:43:20,00:43:26,"run and our feet are made for it. And if you look at, we did in this series of QI, the Raramuri people"
00:43:26,00:43:32,in Mexico and they can run for hundreds and hundreds of miles and they just do it in as thinner sandal
00:43:32,00:43:37,as possible because the ideal way to run is just to have a very thin surface to protect you from
00:43:37,00:43:43,stones or needles and then just use your foot's natural strength. You can tell how fast a runner
00:43:43,00:43:50,"you will be by how long your toes are. Can you believe this? Yes, sprinters have longer toes than"
00:43:50,00:43:55,non-sprinters and that's partly because if you have longer toes your feet stay in contact with the
00:43:55,00:44:01,"ground very slightly longer. Okay, is it also because like whoever gets to the end first it can be"
00:44:01,00:44:07,"any body part, can it, the cross is the line that determines the winner. So if you have massive clown feet."
00:44:07,00:44:11,That's why so many of the best sprinters are clowns.
00:44:11,00:44:20,"Oh, it's who's saying bought in the lead but no wait, here's Bobo the clown behind him, he's going up fast."
00:44:20,00:44:29,"Hey, do you know, you know Einstein famously didn't wear socks. Yeah, famously. Well, I think if"
00:44:29,00:44:33,"you asked anyone for one fact about Einstein, that's what that's why he won his Nobel Prize for,"
00:44:33,00:44:38,"wasn't it? Yeah, yeah, yeah. That's pretty famous, isn't it? He was a non-sock-wearing guy."
00:44:38,00:44:44,"I had never heard that before. I think it's famous in the context of this podcast, I think, but yeah."
00:44:44,00:44:48,"No, I've genuinely never heard that done. That's very interesting. Okay, so he's not wearing socks."
00:44:48,00:44:54,"Well, we don't know, he never said the real reason but there is a thought that it's because he suffered"
00:44:54,00:45:04,from excessive foot sweatiness. He was famous in the military circles for having sweaty feet.
00:45:04,00:45:10,To the point where he was not allowed to sign up for the Swiss military because they said that his
00:45:10,00:45:14,feet were too sweaty. They don't buy you from the military because you got sweaty feet.
00:45:14,00:45:20,"He had flat feet, varicose veins and excessive foot perspiration was what's on the official report."
00:45:20,00:45:25,"Maybe he would give away if they were trying to attack somewhere by night, like a surprise attack,"
00:45:25,00:45:35,"but then they were... Yeah, surely, then, if you have sweaty feet, you would wear socks because"
00:45:35,00:45:40,"that's going to soak up the sweat. I would wear socks lined with sphagnum moss, which can absorb"
00:45:40,00:45:46,"30 times, so weight and water. Yeah, no, as I say, he never said it was for that reason,"
00:45:46,00:45:50,"it just, it's an interesting thing to note. I think you wouldn't want to go around with wet socks,"
00:45:50,00:45:56,"but then you've just got wet shoes instead, right? Yeah, but the soul that inner padding is a bit more"
00:45:56,00:46:01,"of a, I think you could suck more water into that and not be wet. No, I mean, because the worst"
00:46:01,00:46:05,"thing about wearing no socks and trainers is the fact that it's too sweaty, although it does make"
00:46:05,00:46:09,sense that the military wouldn't allow him in because that's why Prince Andrew was so desirable
00:46:09,00:46:15,"to the military, wasn't it? An inability to sweat is really something that they do look for."
00:46:15,00:46:20,"And interestingly, he's very good at holding pizzas when he's in pizza expressed because he's learned"
00:46:20,00:46:25,the calcium curvature. We're talking about that.
00:46:25,00:46:34,"Okay, that's it. That is all of our facts. Thank you so much for listening. If you want to get in"
00:46:34,00:46:38,"contact with any of us about the things that we've said over the course of this podcast, we can"
00:46:38,00:46:45,"all be found on our Twitter accounts. I'm on @Sriberland, Andy, @Andruhunterreb, James, @JamesHarkin,"
00:46:45,00:46:51,"and Shazinski. You can email podcast@QI.com, or you can go to our group account, which is @NoSuchThing,"
00:46:51,00:46:56,"or our website. NoSuchThing is a fish.com. We've got all of our previous episodes up there. In fact,"
00:46:56,00:47:00,"we have more than usual amounts of previous episodes up there. As we said at the top of the episode,"
00:47:00,00:47:06,"we've just re-uploaded 52 episodes. The second year of fish, so do check them out. And as we said"
00:47:06,00:47:12,"last week, guys, we really hope you're doing okay. Scary times out there, but take care of each other."
00:47:12,00:47:14,We'll be back again next week. See you then. Goodbye.
00:47:14,00:47:29,"Can I just say as well, I'm pretty sure other has lost signal over that. Or the Clifnospagina"
00:47:29,00:47:35,material is not working very well because she's currently completely still on the same pretty good point. That
00:47:35,00:47:40,"took me a long time to notice. I wonder how long she's been gunned. I wonder how much she's... She's not gone,"
00:47:40,00:47:41,she's just stunned.
00:47:41,00:47:43,[laughs]
