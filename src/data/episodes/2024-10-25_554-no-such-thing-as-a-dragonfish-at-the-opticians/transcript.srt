1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,580
 (upbeat music)

2
00:00:02,580 --> 00:00:14,860
 - Hello and welcome to another episode

3
00:00:14,860 --> 00:00:16,660
 of No Such Thing as a Fish,

4
00:00:16,660 --> 00:00:20,780
 a weekly podcast this week coming to you live from Cardiff.

5
00:00:20,780 --> 00:00:23,500
 (audience cheering)

6
00:00:23,500 --> 00:00:25,300
 My name is Dan Schreiber.

7
00:00:25,300 --> 00:00:28,540
 I am sitting here with Anna Tyshinski, Andrew Hunter Murray

8
00:00:28,540 --> 00:00:29,740
 and James Harkin.

9
00:00:29,740 --> 00:00:32,180
 And once again, we have gathered round the microphones

10
00:00:32,180 --> 00:00:35,060
 with our four favorite facts from the last seven days

11
00:00:35,060 --> 00:00:38,180
 and in no particular order, here we go.

12
00:00:38,180 --> 00:00:41,700
 Starting with fact number one, that is Andy.

13
00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:44,860
 - My fact is that the Glasgow Tree Hugging Competition

14
00:00:44,860 --> 00:00:46,660
 contains three rounds.

15
00:00:46,660 --> 00:00:51,660
 Speed Hugging, Dedicated Hugging and Freestyle Hugging.

16
00:00:51,660 --> 00:00:53,740
 (audience laughing)

17
00:00:53,740 --> 00:00:55,300
 - Wow. - Yeah.

18
00:00:55,300 --> 00:00:57,100
 - Freestyle. - Freestyle.

19
00:00:57,100 --> 00:00:58,020
 - What is freestyle?

20
00:00:58,020 --> 00:00:59,780
 It still has to be a tree, does it?

21
00:00:59,780 --> 00:01:00,940
 - It all has to be a tree,

22
00:01:00,940 --> 00:01:03,660
 but freestyle is by a long way the most erotic.

23
00:01:03,660 --> 00:01:04,500
 (audience laughing)

24
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:06,420
 - Well, I think we're witnessing freestyle

25
00:01:06,420 --> 00:01:07,380
 in the background here.

26
00:01:07,380 --> 00:01:09,020
 There's an image that we put up on the screens

27
00:01:09,020 --> 00:01:09,860
 at our live show.

28
00:01:09,860 --> 00:01:11,780
 The person up there is Hannah Willow,

29
00:01:11,780 --> 00:01:13,620
 who is the winner of this year's--

30
00:01:13,620 --> 00:01:14,980
 - Hannah Willow? - Yeah.

31
00:01:14,980 --> 00:01:16,940
 - Did she marry the tree that she hugged?

32
00:01:16,940 --> 00:01:17,780
 (audience laughing)

33
00:01:17,780 --> 00:01:18,780
 It looks like it.

34
00:01:18,780 --> 00:01:20,540
 - They should be married, considering--

35
00:01:20,540 --> 00:01:21,860
 - Oh, really? - Considering the--

36
00:01:21,860 --> 00:01:23,540
 - I was gonna say, Andy, for some of us,

37
00:01:23,540 --> 00:01:25,940
 an erotic hug is also the speed hug.

38
00:01:25,940 --> 00:01:28,940
 (audience laughing)

39
00:01:28,940 --> 00:01:32,140
 You have to hug as many trees as possible in one minute.

40
00:01:32,140 --> 00:01:33,700
 So that is both speedy.

41
00:01:33,700 --> 00:01:35,380
 - Do you know the number?

42
00:01:35,380 --> 00:01:37,380
 - I actually don't know what Hannah scored on that,

43
00:01:37,380 --> 00:01:38,860
 but the hugs have to last five seconds each,

44
00:01:38,860 --> 00:01:40,140
 so it's just--

45
00:01:40,140 --> 00:01:41,420
 - Do you know what the world record

46
00:01:41,420 --> 00:01:44,340
 for most trees hugged in an hour is?

47
00:01:44,340 --> 00:01:45,260
 - No. - Ooh.

48
00:01:45,260 --> 00:01:47,100
 - Can you have a guess?

49
00:01:47,100 --> 00:01:48,220
 - What country?

50
00:01:48,220 --> 00:01:49,700
 - Ghana, what? - How will--

51
00:01:49,700 --> 00:01:50,700
 Sorry, then.

52
00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:51,940
 (audience laughing)

53
00:01:51,940 --> 00:01:52,940
 And how are you factoring that

54
00:01:52,940 --> 00:01:55,340
 into your matrix of calculations?

55
00:01:55,340 --> 00:01:58,100
 - So Ghana, dense forest, trees are close to each other.

56
00:01:58,100 --> 00:02:00,580
 - Point, but equatorial, saps the energy.

57
00:02:00,580 --> 00:02:01,420
 (audience laughing)

58
00:02:01,420 --> 00:02:02,260
 - Damn.

59
00:02:02,260 --> 00:02:04,540
 - I think in Ghana, you probably know this, Dan,

60
00:02:04,540 --> 00:02:07,380
 but they've done a lot of tree planting in recent years,

61
00:02:07,380 --> 00:02:09,580
 so they got quite a lot of smaller trees.

62
00:02:09,580 --> 00:02:10,420
 - Oh.

63
00:02:10,420 --> 00:02:11,260
 - But that's good.

64
00:02:11,260 --> 00:02:12,100
 That means you can get between them faster.

65
00:02:12,100 --> 00:02:12,940
 - Exactly.

66
00:02:12,940 --> 00:02:14,060
 I think that's what Dan's asking.

67
00:02:14,060 --> 00:02:14,900
 - Yeah.

68
00:02:14,900 --> 00:02:15,740
 - Okay.

69
00:02:15,740 --> 00:02:16,740
 How many seconds are there in an hour, James?

70
00:02:16,740 --> 00:02:18,740
 - There are about 3,600.

71
00:02:18,740 --> 00:02:22,180
 - I'll say 3,600, one per second.

72
00:02:22,180 --> 00:02:23,020
 - One per second.

73
00:02:23,020 --> 00:02:25,860
 You have to, someone's not bringing the tree to you,

74
00:02:25,860 --> 00:02:26,700
 so you can hug it.

75
00:02:26,700 --> 00:02:28,340
 You have to go from one tree to another.

76
00:02:28,340 --> 00:02:29,580
 - Are you allowed to hug the same?

77
00:02:29,580 --> 00:02:31,700
 Can you just go from one tree and back again and again

78
00:02:31,700 --> 00:02:33,020
 and again, or does that have to be a different tree each time?

79
00:02:33,020 --> 00:02:33,860
 - Every tree different.

80
00:02:33,860 --> 00:02:34,700
 - Every tree different.

81
00:02:34,700 --> 00:02:35,540
 - What if you run up a tree?

82
00:02:35,540 --> 00:02:36,380
 What if you hug so many,

83
00:02:36,380 --> 00:02:37,620
 and no more trees left in Ghana?

84
00:02:37,620 --> 00:02:38,460
 (laughing)

85
00:02:38,460 --> 00:02:40,180
 - The number is lower than the total number

86
00:02:40,180 --> 00:02:41,020
 of trees in Ghana.

87
00:02:41,020 --> 00:02:41,860
 (audience laughing)

88
00:02:41,860 --> 00:02:42,700
 - Okay, but the other way--

89
00:02:42,700 --> 00:02:44,780
 - Does the five second rule apply to each hug?

90
00:02:44,780 --> 00:02:45,860
 - No, it doesn't.

91
00:02:45,860 --> 00:02:46,700
 - What's that?

92
00:02:46,700 --> 00:02:47,940
 If you can still eat it

93
00:02:47,940 --> 00:02:50,260
 as long as you have to drop the tree for five seconds?

94
00:02:50,260 --> 00:02:52,860
 - The tree falls over in the forest, but no one notices,

95
00:02:52,860 --> 00:02:54,460
 and you quickly put it on your plate and it's fine.

96
00:02:54,460 --> 00:02:55,300
 - Yeah.

97
00:02:55,300 --> 00:02:56,700
 No, in this tree hugging,

98
00:02:56,700 --> 00:02:58,860
 you need to hug for five seconds per tree.

99
00:02:58,860 --> 00:02:59,700
 - No, this one is--

100
00:02:59,700 --> 00:03:01,820
 - Okay, so I'm gonna say 400.

101
00:03:01,820 --> 00:03:02,660
 - 100?

102
00:03:02,660 --> 00:03:03,500
 Any advance?

103
00:03:03,500 --> 00:03:05,580
 - I think about a grand, about a thousand.

104
00:03:05,580 --> 00:03:06,740
 - About a thousand.

105
00:03:06,740 --> 00:03:08,260
 Anna is correct.

106
00:03:08,260 --> 00:03:09,100
 - What?

107
00:03:09,100 --> 00:03:11,900
 - Almost, it's 1,123,

108
00:03:11,900 --> 00:03:14,940
 which is on average one every 3.2 seconds.

109
00:03:14,940 --> 00:03:15,780
 - Wow, decent.

110
00:03:15,780 --> 00:03:16,620
 - That's really good.

111
00:03:16,620 --> 00:03:17,460
 - That's pretty good.

112
00:03:17,460 --> 00:03:20,940
 Abu Bakar Tahiru did it this year.

113
00:03:20,940 --> 00:03:21,780
 - Nice.

114
00:03:21,780 --> 00:03:24,020
 - But Hannah Willow, previously mentioned,

115
00:03:24,020 --> 00:03:25,820
 I think where she excelled

116
00:03:25,820 --> 00:03:27,900
 in these three elements you mentioned, Andy,

117
00:03:27,900 --> 00:03:29,300
 is the dedication.

118
00:03:29,300 --> 00:03:33,060
 And that is where you show devotion, passion, and loyalty.

119
00:03:33,060 --> 00:03:36,260
 So, that's where she won the competition.

120
00:03:36,260 --> 00:03:38,500
 - And that's a single tree, isn't it?

121
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:39,580
 - Yes, that's a single tree.

122
00:03:39,580 --> 00:03:41,260
 - And it's interesting, I think freestyle,

123
00:03:41,260 --> 00:03:42,820
 that round is also a single tree.

124
00:03:42,820 --> 00:03:45,780
 So you have to show something other than an embrace.

125
00:03:45,780 --> 00:03:46,900
 So it's not actually a hug at all.

126
00:03:46,900 --> 00:03:50,580
 It's, you might play it a song, you might...

127
00:03:50,580 --> 00:03:51,660
 - Oh, great.

128
00:03:51,660 --> 00:03:53,860
 - She did a dance, that was her big thing.

129
00:03:53,860 --> 00:03:56,500
 Yeah, she didn't know that that was required of her.

130
00:03:56,500 --> 00:03:58,180
 So she just had to improvise a dance.

131
00:03:58,180 --> 00:04:00,660
 But she is someone who goes out and does forest bathing.

132
00:04:00,660 --> 00:04:03,620
 She spends a lot of time getting in touch with nature.

133
00:04:03,620 --> 00:04:05,500
 - Can we talk about what forest bathing is?

134
00:04:05,500 --> 00:04:06,860
 'Cause I read that as well and I liked that.

135
00:04:06,860 --> 00:04:07,820
 - Yeah, what is that?

136
00:04:07,820 --> 00:04:10,100
 - Well, it's when you go out to the forest

137
00:04:10,100 --> 00:04:12,020
 and you just bathe, right?

138
00:04:12,020 --> 00:04:16,020
 You're like, you just take in the smells

139
00:04:16,020 --> 00:04:17,740
 and the air and the, it's just going out.

140
00:04:17,740 --> 00:04:18,740
 It's like a nice wall.

141
00:04:18,740 --> 00:04:21,460
 - So what I assumed is correct that it is another way

142
00:04:21,460 --> 00:04:24,140
 of saying she likes to go for a walk in the woods.

143
00:04:24,140 --> 00:04:28,060
 - Yeah, does she have to take her clothes off like a bath?

144
00:04:28,060 --> 00:04:28,900
 - No.

145
00:04:28,900 --> 00:04:29,740
 - Okay.

146
00:04:29,740 --> 00:04:30,580
 - You don't have to take your clothes off in the bath.

147
00:04:30,580 --> 00:04:31,900
 Fun fact, I don't.

148
00:04:31,900 --> 00:04:34,020
 (laughing)

149
00:04:34,020 --> 00:04:36,020
 - You never take your socks off in any situation.

150
00:04:36,020 --> 00:04:37,740
 - Absolutely not.

151
00:04:37,740 --> 00:04:39,900
 - Even the erotic freestyle.

152
00:04:39,900 --> 00:04:42,260
 - It makes it more erotic if the socks are still on.

153
00:04:42,260 --> 00:04:43,340
 - But it's really cool.

154
00:04:43,340 --> 00:04:45,300
 She's, so she's a mum of three

155
00:04:45,300 --> 00:04:47,140
 and she was asked like,

156
00:04:47,140 --> 00:04:49,940
 are they excited that mum is the tree hugging champion?

157
00:04:49,940 --> 00:04:51,900
 And they said, no, they were hugely embarrassed

158
00:04:51,900 --> 00:04:54,460
 to find out I was tree hugging champion.

159
00:04:54,460 --> 00:04:56,900
 Yeah, I've slightly ruined their street cred

160
00:04:56,900 --> 00:04:57,740
 is what she said.

161
00:04:57,740 --> 00:04:59,420
 But she's going to ruin it even more

162
00:04:59,420 --> 00:05:01,940
 because it's not just about winning the Glaswegian

163
00:05:01,940 --> 00:05:03,060
 tree hugging competition.

164
00:05:03,060 --> 00:05:07,260
 She now, by winning that qualifies to represent Glasgow

165
00:05:07,260 --> 00:05:09,500
 in the international tree hugging competition

166
00:05:09,500 --> 00:05:11,100
 that happens in Finland.

167
00:05:11,100 --> 00:05:13,120
 It's like a giant global competition

168
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:15,980
 where all our best huggers go and meet in Finland

169
00:05:15,980 --> 00:05:16,820
 for an ultimate hug.

170
00:05:16,820 --> 00:05:19,300
 - That's gonna be tough for the favourites from Ghana,

171
00:05:19,300 --> 00:05:20,140
 isn't it?

172
00:05:20,140 --> 00:05:21,940
 Going all the way up to Finland and that cold weather.

173
00:05:21,940 --> 00:05:22,780
 - Yes.

174
00:05:22,780 --> 00:05:23,620
 - It's gonna be really tough.

175
00:05:23,620 --> 00:05:24,460
 - It is advantage.

176
00:05:24,460 --> 00:05:26,820
 - And the taller trees, they won't know what to do, right?

177
00:05:26,820 --> 00:05:27,660
 - Yeah.

178
00:05:27,660 --> 00:05:31,260
 I assume you only took the bottom of the trees, right?

179
00:05:31,260 --> 00:05:33,220
 - Yeah, there's no rule about whether you have to hug

180
00:05:33,220 --> 00:05:34,060
 base or tip.

181
00:05:34,060 --> 00:05:34,900
 It's just not.

182
00:05:34,900 --> 00:05:37,740
 - Go on.

183
00:05:37,740 --> 00:05:39,060
 - Guard it.

184
00:05:39,060 --> 00:05:41,900
 But no, it is, it's a really, it's quite fun.

185
00:05:41,900 --> 00:05:43,080
 I mean, I was quite skeptical about it.

186
00:05:43,080 --> 00:05:45,160
 I think it was a bit silly, but the Finnish one,

187
00:05:45,160 --> 00:05:47,960
 which is in a place called Halibu, I think,

188
00:05:47,960 --> 00:05:50,000
 it was designed this competition by the family

189
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:53,520
 of a lumberjack who realised he'd been growing

190
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:57,000
 all these trees and he loved them too much to cut them down.

191
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,600
 And he was like a shepherd who just can't bear

192
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:00,640
 going to the abattoir.

193
00:06:00,640 --> 00:06:03,120
 So he and his family thought of this programme

194
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:05,160
 where people adopt trees and they've been trying--

195
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:07,360
 - Is that not just a lazy lumberjack?

196
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:08,200
 - Well.

197
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:10,320
 - Who says, oh yeah, sorry, I didn't chop any down today

198
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:12,580
 because I love them too much.

199
00:06:12,580 --> 00:06:14,740
 - You're right, letting someone hug your trees

200
00:06:14,740 --> 00:06:17,480
 is a much skin off your nose, is it?

201
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:19,820
 - But this has become a big thing since COVID.

202
00:06:19,820 --> 00:06:22,860
 And I remember when we were playing on a previous tour,

203
00:06:22,860 --> 00:06:24,740
 we were playing Richmond in London

204
00:06:24,740 --> 00:06:26,420
 and I went to Kew Gardens beforehand

205
00:06:26,420 --> 00:06:30,340
 and I saw a lady go up and give a massive hug to a tree.

206
00:06:30,340 --> 00:06:32,420
 And it looks so nice.

207
00:06:32,420 --> 00:06:34,420
 It looks so, 'cause like we'd all been stuck

208
00:06:34,420 --> 00:06:37,140
 and she was allowed to connect back with nature again.

209
00:06:37,140 --> 00:06:38,820
 And I just, it was a bit pervy.

210
00:06:38,820 --> 00:06:40,540
 I just watched them hug for ages.

211
00:06:40,540 --> 00:06:43,280
 - What were you doing while you were watching?

212
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:45,160
 'Cause if it was just watching, I think it's fine.

213
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:46,400
 - I think the rule is if you're in a bush,

214
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:47,240
 it's not all right.

215
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:49,560
 If you're just in the open, it's fine.

216
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:50,560
 - Unless you're hugging the bush.

217
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:51,600
 - You might be bush bathing.

218
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:52,640
 That's the thing, though, yeah.

219
00:06:52,640 --> 00:06:54,920
 - Yeah, I was just watching.

220
00:06:54,920 --> 00:06:56,560
 I didn't, yeah, I just watched.

221
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:58,560
 - There is evidence that if you--

222
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:00,280
 - I just watched.

223
00:07:00,280 --> 00:07:03,960
 Don't keep saying it, but I only watched, guys.

224
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:06,240
 - There is evidence that you can lower your blood pressure

225
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:07,340
 by touching wood.

226
00:07:07,820 --> 00:07:08,940
 (audience laughs)

227
00:07:08,940 --> 00:07:10,900
 - Andy said, "Grow up, guys, come on."

228
00:07:10,900 --> 00:07:14,700
 Different types of wood, depending on the texture

229
00:07:14,700 --> 00:07:16,500
 of the wood, it can have a different effect.

230
00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:18,180
 - So not the splintery ones?

231
00:07:18,180 --> 00:07:20,100
 - Not the splintery ones.

232
00:07:20,100 --> 00:07:22,500
 - Is that in the form of a tree, or is it just any wood?

233
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:23,900
 - It actually works with any wood.

234
00:07:23,900 --> 00:07:24,740
 - Really?

235
00:07:24,740 --> 00:07:26,540
 - Yeah, yeah, they did it where they compared people

236
00:07:26,540 --> 00:07:29,220
 putting their hand on plastic, on metal,

237
00:07:29,220 --> 00:07:31,140
 and then on wood and their blood pressure went down.

238
00:07:31,140 --> 00:07:32,260
 - Really?

239
00:07:32,260 --> 00:07:35,420
 - Oh, well, I hugged a tree in preparation for this fact.

240
00:07:35,420 --> 00:07:36,260
 - Did you?

241
00:07:36,260 --> 00:07:38,220
 - Your research is always below par down,

242
00:07:38,220 --> 00:07:39,660
 but this is reaching new depths.

243
00:07:39,660 --> 00:07:41,740
 - No, but it is really nice.

244
00:07:41,740 --> 00:07:43,540
 I've got to say, it was a genuinely nice experience,

245
00:07:43,540 --> 00:07:45,940
 and a lot of people have been getting back in contact

246
00:07:45,940 --> 00:07:46,940
 with nature in that kind of way.

247
00:07:46,940 --> 00:07:48,140
 Again, since the pandemic,

248
00:07:48,140 --> 00:07:49,500
 and there's been reports all over the world,

249
00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:51,380
 so in New Zealand, there's great trees

250
00:07:51,380 --> 00:07:54,460
 that the curators keep busting people, hugging.

251
00:07:54,460 --> 00:07:56,180
 He's like, "I kind of get it, though.

252
00:07:56,180 --> 00:07:58,340
 "This tree has ribbons of flaky brown bark,

253
00:07:58,340 --> 00:08:00,940
 "almost begs to be peeled like a banana."

254
00:08:00,940 --> 00:08:04,460
 And he talks about great trees to hug,

255
00:08:04,460 --> 00:08:08,740
 like the long leaf pine, the spongy bark that it has.

256
00:08:08,740 --> 00:08:10,740
 It practically hugs back, you know?

257
00:08:10,740 --> 00:08:11,580
 - Oh.

258
00:08:11,580 --> 00:08:15,100
 - I can see, I can see, but I did only watch.

259
00:08:15,100 --> 00:08:16,420
 (audience laughs)

260
00:08:16,420 --> 00:08:18,300
 - And what kind of tree did you hug?

261
00:08:18,300 --> 00:08:20,100
 - It's a tree that's in my garden.

262
00:08:20,100 --> 00:08:21,940
 - But did you even find out its name?

263
00:08:21,940 --> 00:08:24,140
 (audience laughs)

264
00:08:24,140 --> 00:08:25,500
 - Okay, this is a bit embarrassing,

265
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:26,860
 'cause there's five trees.

266
00:08:26,860 --> 00:08:28,660
 We named them after each member of our family,

267
00:08:28,660 --> 00:08:30,620
 so I hugged, I hugged Daddy.

268
00:08:30,620 --> 00:08:33,460
 (audience laughs)

269
00:08:34,060 --> 00:08:36,940
 (audience laughs)

270
00:08:36,940 --> 00:08:39,020
 - I don't wanna rain on this tree-hugging parade,

271
00:08:39,020 --> 00:08:42,300
 but something smells bad about it,

272
00:08:42,300 --> 00:08:45,500
 and it's this, that, so it's organized,

273
00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:48,100
 the Glasgow Tree Hugging Competition by Vicky Dale.

274
00:08:48,100 --> 00:08:51,660
 The children's prize was won by Lottie,

275
00:08:51,660 --> 00:08:53,940
 who is Dale's daughter.

276
00:08:53,940 --> 00:08:55,340
 And-- - What?

277
00:08:55,340 --> 00:08:57,260
 - The children's speed-hugging race

278
00:08:57,260 --> 00:08:59,860
 won by Freddie, Dale's son.

279
00:08:59,860 --> 00:09:00,700
 - Oh, dear.

280
00:09:00,700 --> 00:09:01,900
 - What's going on there, guys?

281
00:09:01,900 --> 00:09:04,260
 There were only 15 entrants in this whole contest,

282
00:09:04,260 --> 00:09:06,820
 by the way, which, the Guardian write-up

283
00:09:06,820 --> 00:09:08,860
 of Hannah Willow-winning was saying,

284
00:09:08,860 --> 00:09:11,020
 "Willow has savored the rush of victory before,

285
00:09:11,020 --> 00:09:12,500
 "but only on a minor scale."

286
00:09:12,500 --> 00:09:13,740
 (audience laughs)

287
00:09:13,740 --> 00:09:16,740
 How major is this 15-entern competition?

288
00:09:16,740 --> 00:09:18,340
 - She's super cool, though, by the way.

289
00:09:18,340 --> 00:09:20,340
 If you, I've gone onto her Instagram,

290
00:09:20,340 --> 00:09:21,860
 'cause I was trying to get in contact with her

291
00:09:21,860 --> 00:09:23,380
 to ask her questions for this.

292
00:09:23,380 --> 00:09:26,540
 - Would you be willing for me to watch out of the open?

293
00:09:26,540 --> 00:09:28,180
 (audience laughs)

294
00:09:28,180 --> 00:09:29,980
 - You're sincerely a daddy.

295
00:09:29,980 --> 00:09:32,820
 (audience laughs)

296
00:09:32,820 --> 00:09:36,140
 - Well, while we're on that subject,

297
00:09:36,140 --> 00:09:38,900
 there is a thing called, what is it, dendrophilia,

298
00:09:38,900 --> 00:09:41,820
 which is basically the sexualization of trees.

299
00:09:41,820 --> 00:09:43,100
 I mean, that is a real thing.

300
00:09:43,100 --> 00:09:47,540
 - I saw a news article of a man in Wiltshire in 2023,

301
00:09:47,540 --> 00:09:51,580
 who was arrested after apparently having sex with a tree,

302
00:09:51,580 --> 00:09:52,860
 so said the headline.

303
00:09:52,860 --> 00:09:55,260
 One witness said, "I was just walking in the park

304
00:09:55,260 --> 00:09:57,740
 "with one of my mates, and we saw a man hugging a tree,

305
00:09:57,740 --> 00:09:59,340
 "and thought it was interesting.

306
00:09:59,340 --> 00:10:00,900
 "We walked closer, and as we did,

307
00:10:00,900 --> 00:10:05,060
 "we saw his trousers down, and thought, 'This is pure gold.'"

308
00:10:05,060 --> 00:10:08,380
 (audience laughs)

309
00:10:08,380 --> 00:10:10,300
 - After I stopped recording,

310
00:10:10,300 --> 00:10:13,060
 (audience laughs)

311
00:10:13,060 --> 00:10:15,220
 the police turned up and arrested him.

312
00:10:15,220 --> 00:10:18,620
 - Wow, good grief.

313
00:10:18,620 --> 00:10:20,100
 Celebrity tree huggers?

314
00:10:20,100 --> 00:10:21,220
 - Oh, yeah. - Oh, yeah.

315
00:10:21,220 --> 00:10:24,220
 - So Prince Charles, as we know.

316
00:10:24,220 --> 00:10:25,300
 - Yeah, he talks to them.

317
00:10:25,300 --> 00:10:27,980
 - He, yeah, King Charles, I know.

318
00:10:27,980 --> 00:10:30,260
 He claims he shakes hands with every tree he's planted

319
00:10:30,260 --> 00:10:31,220
 and wishes them well.

320
00:10:31,220 --> 00:10:32,380
 - What is a tree is--

321
00:10:32,380 --> 00:10:34,220
 - Well, a leaf, a branch.

322
00:10:34,220 --> 00:10:36,700
 - I would say a leaf is a finger, yeah, a branch is an arm.

323
00:10:36,700 --> 00:10:37,860
 - No, he tends to do leaves,

324
00:10:37,860 --> 00:10:39,940
 so it's usually a tree planting ceremony,

325
00:10:39,940 --> 00:10:42,500
 and he'll shake a leaf and say, "Oh, have a good time."

326
00:10:42,500 --> 00:10:43,820
 And walk off, it's sort of--

327
00:10:43,820 --> 00:10:45,140
 - But you have to shake so many leaves.

328
00:10:45,140 --> 00:10:47,140
 You don't want to do it like a full hug for everyone.

329
00:10:47,140 --> 00:10:49,020
 - Yeah, sure. - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

330
00:10:49,020 --> 00:10:50,540
 Novak Djokovic?

331
00:10:50,540 --> 00:10:52,180
 - Yeah. - Again, not that surprising.

332
00:10:52,180 --> 00:10:54,300
 - Tree hugger? - Yeah.

333
00:10:54,300 --> 00:10:55,300
 - When he does the Australian Open,

334
00:10:55,300 --> 00:10:57,060
 he goes to the Melbourne Botanical Gardens,

335
00:10:57,060 --> 00:10:58,860
 and he gets some tree-hugging time in.

336
00:10:58,860 --> 00:10:59,700
 - Does he? - Does he.

337
00:10:59,700 --> 00:11:00,540
 - Does he? - Yeah.

338
00:11:00,540 --> 00:11:01,540
 - Is that 'cause he kisses the grass as well, doesn't he?

339
00:11:01,540 --> 00:11:03,300
 I know he tastes the grass at Wimbledon.

340
00:11:03,300 --> 00:11:04,660
 - Yeah, he eats. - Eats it.

341
00:11:04,660 --> 00:11:06,580
 - Yeah, right? - Yeah, must be related.

342
00:11:06,580 --> 00:11:07,780
 - Yeah. - Tree-hugging,

343
00:11:07,780 --> 00:11:11,740
 tree-huggers used to be squirrel killers.

344
00:11:11,740 --> 00:11:15,060
 I was looking for the first references to tree-hugger,

345
00:11:15,060 --> 00:11:17,660
 and a lot of people say that it came from the '70s,

346
00:11:17,660 --> 00:11:19,340
 but the OED says first reference

347
00:11:19,340 --> 00:11:21,540
 to someone being a tree-hugger in a hippie,

348
00:11:21,540 --> 00:11:23,140
 please stop building this motorway here

349
00:11:23,140 --> 00:11:25,220
 because it involves felling trees way.

350
00:11:25,220 --> 00:11:30,220
 It's 1965, and so there are a few people in Appleton,

351
00:11:30,220 --> 00:11:32,300
 fittingly, Wisconsin, who were named that

352
00:11:32,300 --> 00:11:33,620
 'cause Apple is a kind of tree.

353
00:11:33,620 --> 00:11:35,780
 (laughing)

354
00:11:35,780 --> 00:11:38,620
 But at the same time, in 1965, in Indiana,

355
00:11:38,620 --> 00:11:41,100
 they were using tree-hugger to describe squirrel hunters,

356
00:11:41,100 --> 00:11:44,140
 and it was because they basically hide behind a tree

357
00:11:44,140 --> 00:11:45,140
 that's thicker than them,

358
00:11:45,140 --> 00:11:47,180
 a tree whose girth is larger than them,

359
00:11:47,180 --> 00:11:49,420
 watching squirrels, and then dart to another tree

360
00:11:49,420 --> 00:11:53,500
 and hug that tree, and then eventually kill a squirrel.

361
00:11:53,500 --> 00:11:55,900
 Although it does say that all tree-huggers

362
00:11:55,900 --> 00:11:57,860
 are possessed with a love of the outdoors,

363
00:11:57,860 --> 00:11:59,540
 and actually catching a squirrel

364
00:11:59,540 --> 00:12:01,980
 isn't an iron-clad must any more than it is

365
00:12:01,980 --> 00:12:03,540
 for a fisherman to catch a fish,

366
00:12:03,540 --> 00:12:05,660
 which means I've fully misunderstood fishing as well.

367
00:12:05,660 --> 00:12:07,540
 (laughing)

368
00:12:07,540 --> 00:12:10,780
 - That first citation in the OED from 1965,

369
00:12:10,780 --> 00:12:13,980
 it was in South Shore, Chicago.

370
00:12:13,980 --> 00:12:16,540
 They were building a new road through a lot of parks,

371
00:12:16,540 --> 00:12:18,340
 and they had to chop down some trees,

372
00:12:18,340 --> 00:12:21,500
 and all of these conservationists sort of hugged the trees

373
00:12:21,500 --> 00:12:23,580
 and tried to stop them from doing it.

374
00:12:23,580 --> 00:12:25,740
 And it turns out that one of the protesters

375
00:12:25,740 --> 00:12:27,460
 was called Bernard Baum.

376
00:12:27,460 --> 00:12:30,180
 And Baum is German for tree.

377
00:12:30,180 --> 00:12:31,620
 - Yes. - Oh.

378
00:12:31,620 --> 00:12:33,180
 - Come on. - That's very good.

379
00:12:33,180 --> 00:12:34,780
 We're gonna have to move on in a sec, guys.

380
00:12:34,780 --> 00:12:38,540
 - Oh, can I tell you another sort of competition-related fact

381
00:12:38,540 --> 00:12:39,740
 that has something to do with trees?

382
00:12:39,740 --> 00:12:41,180
 It's about the World Concord Championships.

383
00:12:41,180 --> 00:12:42,020
 Have you guys read this?

384
00:12:42,020 --> 00:12:44,220
 Breaking news. - Yes, literally breaking.

385
00:12:44,220 --> 00:12:46,660
 - It's literally happening right now before our very eyes.

386
00:12:46,660 --> 00:12:48,180
 The investigation is going on.

387
00:12:48,180 --> 00:12:50,500
 It just happened in Northamptonshire,

388
00:12:50,500 --> 00:12:52,820
 and allegations of cheating.

389
00:12:52,820 --> 00:12:54,180
 And it's very serious.

390
00:12:54,180 --> 00:12:56,140
 There's this guy called David Jacobs.

391
00:12:56,140 --> 00:12:57,260
 He's 82.

392
00:12:57,260 --> 00:13:00,060
 He's been competing since 1977.

393
00:13:00,060 --> 00:13:02,660
 Every year goes to the World Concord Championships.

394
00:13:02,660 --> 00:13:04,500
 He won this time.

395
00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:08,260
 And now there are allegations he used as steel conker.

396
00:13:08,260 --> 00:13:10,340
 - And it was the first time he won, maybe?

397
00:13:10,340 --> 00:13:11,420
 - Yeah, yeah, it was the first time he's won.

398
00:13:11,420 --> 00:13:13,420
 - Yeah, yeah. - Also, he's the chief judge.

399
00:13:13,420 --> 00:13:14,900
 This goes all the way to the top.

400
00:13:14,900 --> 00:13:16,540
 - Yeah. - It's like, yeah.

401
00:13:16,540 --> 00:13:18,340
 - It's just like the dales all over.

402
00:13:18,340 --> 00:13:19,620
 - Absolutely. - He's got a painted,

403
00:13:19,620 --> 00:13:22,380
 he had a painted nut, which he said was just for humor value.

404
00:13:22,380 --> 00:13:24,860
 What's the humor value in, I guess,

405
00:13:24,860 --> 00:13:27,540
 it's a bit, if you play conkers, I guess it's funny.

406
00:13:27,540 --> 00:13:28,820
 - Yeah. - I guess.

407
00:13:28,820 --> 00:13:31,100
 - But it turns out he was concealing steel.

408
00:13:31,100 --> 00:13:32,780
 - Well, did he use the steel nut

409
00:13:32,780 --> 00:13:34,860
 to smash his opponents' conkers to pieces?

410
00:13:34,860 --> 00:13:35,700
 'Cause a couple of the opponents said,

411
00:13:35,700 --> 00:13:38,940
 "My conker just exploded when he tapped it for the first time."

412
00:13:38,940 --> 00:13:40,660
 And yeah, this is a huge, this is huge.

413
00:13:40,660 --> 00:13:42,140
 - And we just want to say for the lawyers,

414
00:13:42,140 --> 00:13:44,260
 nothing's been proven either way yet.

415
00:13:44,260 --> 00:13:45,740
 It's all still underway.

416
00:13:45,740 --> 00:13:47,100
 And he was actually defeated in the final.

417
00:13:47,100 --> 00:13:49,700
 It seems like they must be gender divided until the end,

418
00:13:49,700 --> 00:13:51,180
 'cause he won the men's section,

419
00:13:51,180 --> 00:13:54,060
 but then he was defeated by Kelsey Banshbuck

420
00:13:54,060 --> 00:13:57,820
 from Indianapolis, who came all the way to Northamptonshire

421
00:13:57,820 --> 00:13:59,660
 to defeat him in the final.

422
00:13:59,660 --> 00:14:00,500
 - Wow. - Wow.

423
00:14:00,500 --> 00:14:01,580
 - First American to win.

424
00:14:01,580 --> 00:14:02,540
 - And what was she using?

425
00:14:02,540 --> 00:14:04,260
 Like a platinum, a cover?

426
00:14:04,260 --> 00:14:06,660
 (all laughing)

427
00:14:06,660 --> 00:14:08,180
 - Put the conker in a shotgun, yeah.

428
00:14:08,180 --> 00:14:09,020
 - Can I tell you one more--

429
00:14:09,020 --> 00:14:10,620
 - Yeah, go for it. - Natural competition.

430
00:14:10,620 --> 00:14:12,660
 This was in 2002 in Australia.

431
00:14:12,660 --> 00:14:14,580
 They had a sheep counting competition.

432
00:14:14,580 --> 00:14:15,980
 - Oh, yeah.

433
00:14:15,980 --> 00:14:17,420
 - Like there were 10 competitors,

434
00:14:17,420 --> 00:14:19,660
 they ran 400 sheep past them.

435
00:14:19,660 --> 00:14:20,500
 - 400.

436
00:14:20,500 --> 00:14:22,620
 (all laughing)

437
00:14:22,620 --> 00:14:24,260
 - No, they didn't tell them they were 400,

438
00:14:24,260 --> 00:14:26,980
 but you had to count them as they ran past you.

439
00:14:26,980 --> 00:14:28,860
 There was an indeterminate number of sheep running past you

440
00:14:28,860 --> 00:14:29,700
 and you had to count them.

441
00:14:29,700 --> 00:14:31,980
 - I would count the legs and divide by four.

442
00:14:31,980 --> 00:14:33,300
 (all laughing)

443
00:14:33,300 --> 00:14:34,380
 - Show off. - Very good.

444
00:14:34,380 --> 00:14:35,220
 - And is it the idea

445
00:14:35,220 --> 00:14:37,020
 whoever's awake at the end is the winner?

446
00:14:37,020 --> 00:14:37,860
 - That's it.

447
00:14:37,860 --> 00:14:40,440
 (upbeat music)

448
00:14:43,740 --> 00:14:47,100
 - Okay, it is time for us to move on to fact number two,

449
00:14:47,100 --> 00:14:48,820
 and that is Anna.

450
00:14:48,820 --> 00:14:52,180
 - My fact this week is that the wax coating

451
00:14:52,180 --> 00:14:57,180
 on 6,400 shot bought apples is enough to make one tea light.

452
00:14:57,180 --> 00:14:58,700
 - Wow.

453
00:14:58,700 --> 00:15:00,900
 - Yes, apples, tomatoes, lemons, peppers,

454
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:02,920
 you get in shops, it's all covered in wax,

455
00:15:02,920 --> 00:15:05,020
 but it's a very tiny layer.

456
00:15:05,020 --> 00:15:07,500
 There's lots of rumours that it can give you, you know,

457
00:15:07,500 --> 00:15:09,300
 cancer and make your head explode and stuff.

458
00:15:09,300 --> 00:15:11,700
 So I thought, I wonder how much they're actually putting on.

459
00:15:11,700 --> 00:15:14,020
 And I read that one pound of wax

460
00:15:14,020 --> 00:15:17,180
 will cover 160,000 pieces of fruit

461
00:15:17,180 --> 00:15:20,100
 and one pound of wax also makes,

462
00:15:20,100 --> 00:15:22,260
 according to various craft sites,

463
00:15:22,260 --> 00:15:23,740
 which I spent a long time on,

464
00:15:23,740 --> 00:15:26,940
 but I think one pound of wax makes about 25 tea candles.

465
00:15:26,940 --> 00:15:29,540
 And so there you go, 6,400 apples,

466
00:15:29,540 --> 00:15:32,900
 melt the wax off, you've got a tea light, you're welcome.

467
00:15:32,900 --> 00:15:33,820
 (all laughing)

468
00:15:33,820 --> 00:15:36,180
 - And a tea light is one of those little white round ones,

469
00:15:36,180 --> 00:15:37,020
 is it?

470
00:15:37,020 --> 00:15:38,380
 'Cause I had to look this up, actually.

471
00:15:38,380 --> 00:15:40,340
 - That is such a man thing to do.

472
00:15:40,340 --> 00:15:41,980
 (all laughing)

473
00:15:41,980 --> 00:15:44,820
 - No man listening knows what a tea light is,

474
00:15:44,820 --> 00:15:46,780
 and no woman listening doesn't, it's just a...

475
00:15:46,780 --> 00:15:50,260
 - And they were invented to make tea with or something.

476
00:15:50,260 --> 00:15:52,020
 I read that, I don't know if this is true,

477
00:15:52,020 --> 00:15:53,340
 'cause I didn't know what they were,

478
00:15:53,340 --> 00:15:56,260
 but apparently in the Japanese tea ceremony,

479
00:15:56,260 --> 00:15:58,620
 you have put them underneath your kettle to keep it warm.

480
00:15:58,620 --> 00:16:00,060
 - Oh my God, this is so weird,

481
00:16:00,060 --> 00:16:02,520
 because I've got a small kettle at home,

482
00:16:02,520 --> 00:16:04,380
 which has a tea light underneath it

483
00:16:04,380 --> 00:16:05,780
 for making the water warm.

484
00:16:05,780 --> 00:16:07,020
 And I just thought that was a gimmick

485
00:16:07,020 --> 00:16:08,360
 that they found to do with the tea light,

486
00:16:08,360 --> 00:16:10,060
 but you're telling me that's the original purpose.

487
00:16:10,060 --> 00:16:13,300
 - It looks like it has enough flame to keep something heat.

488
00:16:13,300 --> 00:16:15,140
 - Probably just sort of keep, you know, maintain.

489
00:16:15,140 --> 00:16:17,460
 - Just a little simmery.

490
00:16:17,460 --> 00:16:19,220
 - The wax is so weird.

491
00:16:19,220 --> 00:16:22,260
 So this happens even more in America

492
00:16:22,260 --> 00:16:23,100
 than it does in the UK.

493
00:16:23,100 --> 00:16:24,980
 Like in America, everything is sold

494
00:16:24,980 --> 00:16:27,060
 with a thin layer of wax on the top of it, basically.

495
00:16:27,060 --> 00:16:28,420
 - I think it's pretty much all fruit,

496
00:16:28,420 --> 00:16:29,700
 like all apples you buy in the shop here.

497
00:16:29,700 --> 00:16:30,620
 Yeah, all fruit you buy here

498
00:16:30,620 --> 00:16:32,020
 will also have all the other wax on it.

499
00:16:32,020 --> 00:16:35,100
 - But it's this thing called epicuticular wax,

500
00:16:35,100 --> 00:16:36,660
 like cuticles is in skin.

501
00:16:36,660 --> 00:16:40,860
 And the thing is, apples grow with a thin layer

502
00:16:40,860 --> 00:16:43,780
 of wax on them, which is then removed

503
00:16:43,780 --> 00:16:45,700
 during the harvesting process.

504
00:16:45,700 --> 00:16:47,420
 And they think, oh no, we lost all the wax

505
00:16:47,420 --> 00:16:49,460
 that was growing beautifully on the apple anyway.

506
00:16:49,460 --> 00:16:53,500
 So they put wax from a different species back on the apple.

507
00:16:53,500 --> 00:16:56,020
 - So I have a tree in my garden.

508
00:16:56,020 --> 00:16:57,540
 - Oh no. - It's no, Dan.

509
00:16:57,540 --> 00:16:59,820
 Leave it alone.

510
00:16:59,820 --> 00:17:01,340
 - Well, no, I took an apple off the tree

511
00:17:01,340 --> 00:17:02,460
 and it was very exciting.

512
00:17:02,460 --> 00:17:05,220
 It was like, my God, I've got an apple from my own garden.

513
00:17:05,220 --> 00:17:08,540
 And it was so waxy that even when I washed it

514
00:17:08,540 --> 00:17:11,620
 under the sink, it just took ages to get off.

515
00:17:11,620 --> 00:17:16,340
 Yeah, and I stupidly used washing liquid on it

516
00:17:16,340 --> 00:17:18,820
 at one point to try and get it off.

517
00:17:18,820 --> 00:17:21,620
 But yeah, I felt it literally the other day.

518
00:17:21,620 --> 00:17:22,780
 - That's cool 'cause it's quite,

519
00:17:22,780 --> 00:17:25,180
 usually on fruit it's quite powdery and unsightly.

520
00:17:25,180 --> 00:17:27,340
 You often see it on plums, it's most obvious,

521
00:17:27,340 --> 00:17:28,340
 it's like a white powder.

522
00:17:28,340 --> 00:17:29,860
 But why did you want to take it off?

523
00:17:29,860 --> 00:17:30,780
 It's fine.

524
00:17:30,780 --> 00:17:31,620
 - What do you mean?

525
00:17:31,620 --> 00:17:32,940
 Oh, I thought you meant off the tree to eat it.

526
00:17:32,940 --> 00:17:34,700
 (laughing)

527
00:17:34,700 --> 00:17:37,140
 - Oh, no, no, it just felt odd, it just felt.

528
00:17:37,140 --> 00:17:37,980
 - But it grows back.

529
00:17:37,980 --> 00:17:39,900
 Even if it gets scratched or removed during the harvesting,

530
00:17:39,900 --> 00:17:41,620
 it would grow back naturally.

531
00:17:41,620 --> 00:17:43,620
 But during those few days,

532
00:17:43,620 --> 00:17:44,780
 the fruit would shrink a little bit

533
00:17:44,780 --> 00:17:46,180
 'cause it's lost a layer of protection

534
00:17:46,180 --> 00:17:47,980
 and it would lose a little bit of volume.

535
00:17:47,980 --> 00:17:48,820
 - Moisture, right.

536
00:17:48,820 --> 00:17:49,660
 - Moisture.

537
00:17:49,660 --> 00:17:51,900
 And so it's worth spraying the wax on

538
00:17:51,900 --> 00:17:53,780
 because it keeps the fruit at exactly the same size

539
00:17:53,780 --> 00:17:55,620
 for that little few days in between.

540
00:17:55,620 --> 00:17:56,820
 - Yeah, it's essential.

541
00:17:56,820 --> 00:17:59,820
 Fruit would be shriveled in the process of making it

542
00:17:59,820 --> 00:18:02,100
 through the, you know, importing it,

543
00:18:02,100 --> 00:18:04,220
 getting it into a short process if we didn't have it on.

544
00:18:04,220 --> 00:18:05,620
 For the same reason they have it on trees.

545
00:18:05,620 --> 00:18:08,220
 It's so that nothing can get in, nothing can get out.

546
00:18:08,220 --> 00:18:09,740
 - But the wax that grows on plants,

547
00:18:09,740 --> 00:18:11,100
 this is, okay, this is unbelievable.

548
00:18:11,100 --> 00:18:13,140
 So it's amazing stuff, epi-cuticular wax.

549
00:18:13,140 --> 00:18:14,100
 It's really cool.

550
00:18:14,100 --> 00:18:15,740
 It repels water, it repels,

551
00:18:15,740 --> 00:18:17,100
 that's why plants are clean,

552
00:18:17,100 --> 00:18:18,300
 despite the fact that, you know,

553
00:18:18,300 --> 00:18:19,620
 water has all sorts of stuff in it,

554
00:18:19,620 --> 00:18:21,260
 the water just rolls off.

555
00:18:21,260 --> 00:18:24,020
 The other thing is, it makes it hard sometimes

556
00:18:24,020 --> 00:18:27,020
 if the plant wants to protect itself from insects

557
00:18:27,020 --> 00:18:29,660
 or other pests.

558
00:18:29,660 --> 00:18:33,260
 The wax itself makes it hard for the insects to walk on.

559
00:18:33,260 --> 00:18:35,900
 They fall off because the wax is kind of like

560
00:18:35,900 --> 00:18:37,620
 a travelator or whatever. - That's cool.

561
00:18:37,620 --> 00:18:41,660
 - And this is, there's an even more weird bit to it.

562
00:18:41,660 --> 00:18:43,020
 There is co-evolution.

563
00:18:43,020 --> 00:18:45,940
 So some plants rely on a single insect

564
00:18:45,940 --> 00:18:48,220
 to walk all over them and fertilize the flowers

565
00:18:48,220 --> 00:18:50,060
 or whatever it might be.

566
00:18:50,060 --> 00:18:55,060
 Some plants have kind of password protected wax.

567
00:18:55,060 --> 00:18:57,980
 So only their chosen insect partner

568
00:18:57,980 --> 00:19:00,860
 can walk along the leaves and the stems

569
00:19:00,860 --> 00:19:02,780
 without falling off and everything else falls off.

570
00:19:02,780 --> 00:19:05,300
 The insect's legs are the password.

571
00:19:05,300 --> 00:19:06,460
 - Oh, just hang on.

572
00:19:06,460 --> 00:19:08,660
 So does the insect's legs specially designed?

573
00:19:08,660 --> 00:19:10,380
 They've got little wax skates on their feet

574
00:19:10,380 --> 00:19:12,260
 or does the plant alter when it feels like an insect?

575
00:19:12,260 --> 00:19:14,260
 - Is it like using your fingerprint to open your phone?

576
00:19:14,260 --> 00:19:15,900
 - Yes, it's exactly like that.

577
00:19:15,900 --> 00:19:18,060
 - This is why King Charles talks to plants.

578
00:19:18,060 --> 00:19:19,980
 They're fucking sentient.

579
00:19:19,980 --> 00:19:21,420
 - Oh no, not this again.

580
00:19:21,420 --> 00:19:22,260
 - Come on.

581
00:19:22,260 --> 00:19:23,420
 - But it's amazing.

582
00:19:23,420 --> 00:19:24,260
 I just found that.

583
00:19:24,260 --> 00:19:25,100
 - Wow.

584
00:19:25,980 --> 00:19:26,820
 - Yeah.

585
00:19:26,820 --> 00:19:30,260
 - By the way, if they are sentient then

586
00:19:30,260 --> 00:19:31,980
 you've got a lot of consent to get.

587
00:19:31,980 --> 00:19:34,220
 (laughing)

588
00:19:34,220 --> 00:19:40,780
 - Operation U Tree's got nothing on you.

589
00:19:40,780 --> 00:19:43,020
 (laughing)

590
00:19:43,020 --> 00:19:48,220
 - Anyway.

591
00:19:48,220 --> 00:19:50,140
 - It's a huge industry.

592
00:19:50,140 --> 00:19:53,900
 The making wax to preserve food in industry.

593
00:19:53,900 --> 00:19:57,380
 And it's actually, it was patented in the 1920s

594
00:19:57,380 --> 00:20:00,220
 and Brogdon's original wax and kerosene makers

595
00:20:00,220 --> 00:20:03,060
 who painted it went to the Supreme Court to defend it.

596
00:20:03,060 --> 00:20:04,340
 This is how big a deal it is.

597
00:20:04,340 --> 00:20:07,100
 And these days, things get dipped in baths of it.

598
00:20:07,100 --> 00:20:09,220
 So when you're eating a melon,

599
00:20:09,220 --> 00:20:12,780
 it might have had a bath in wax before it came to you.

600
00:20:12,780 --> 00:20:15,060
 - And it could be made of lots of different types of wax,

601
00:20:15,060 --> 00:20:15,900
 right?

602
00:20:15,900 --> 00:20:18,700
 I think you said kerosene so you can get like paraffin wax.

603
00:20:18,700 --> 00:20:20,140
 Quite a lot of it is.

604
00:20:20,140 --> 00:20:22,380
 And then there's other ones that are less sound like

605
00:20:22,380 --> 00:20:24,660
 they've come for the petrochemical industry.

606
00:20:24,660 --> 00:20:26,420
 - Bees wax, they used to do it in.

607
00:20:26,420 --> 00:20:28,460
 Bees wax is every, you know what?

608
00:20:28,460 --> 00:20:30,180
 Bees get a lot of credit for honey,

609
00:20:30,180 --> 00:20:32,180
 but people don't talk about the wax that much.

610
00:20:32,180 --> 00:20:34,780
 - In the middle ages, they went on about it a lot.

611
00:20:34,780 --> 00:20:35,620
 - Did they?

612
00:20:35,620 --> 00:20:36,460
 - Oh my God.

613
00:20:36,460 --> 00:20:37,300
 (laughing)

614
00:20:37,300 --> 00:20:39,620
 They really wanked on about it properly.

615
00:20:39,620 --> 00:20:41,100
 - I think they were quite right.

616
00:20:41,100 --> 00:20:42,860
 - Well, because like in those days,

617
00:20:42,860 --> 00:20:45,860
 you had to light your house with candles, right?

618
00:20:45,860 --> 00:20:49,660
 And if you were just a normal person, a pleb like me,

619
00:20:49,660 --> 00:20:51,580
 then you would get it using tallow.

620
00:20:51,580 --> 00:20:53,220
 So you would cook your meat,

621
00:20:53,220 --> 00:20:55,540
 and then there would be some fat there.

622
00:20:55,540 --> 00:20:57,780
 And then a chandler, a candle maker would come round

623
00:20:57,780 --> 00:21:01,020
 to your house and he'd pick up all of the goo

624
00:21:01,020 --> 00:21:03,100
 and he'd turn it into a candle and you would burn it.

625
00:21:03,100 --> 00:21:03,940
 But it would stink.

626
00:21:03,940 --> 00:21:05,060
 It would really, really stink.

627
00:21:05,060 --> 00:21:07,980
 And all the houses would smell of burnt rubbish.

628
00:21:07,980 --> 00:21:10,660
 But then the church decided, well, we don't want that.

629
00:21:10,660 --> 00:21:12,780
 We want perfect white candles.

630
00:21:12,780 --> 00:21:15,260
 And we want it not to smell like old garbage.

631
00:21:15,260 --> 00:21:17,140
 And so they had to have beeswax.

632
00:21:17,140 --> 00:21:21,700
 And the beeswax industry in that time was off the charts.

633
00:21:21,700 --> 00:21:23,860
 They were like wars because the price

634
00:21:23,860 --> 00:21:25,300
 of beeswax went too high.

635
00:21:25,300 --> 00:21:26,140
 - Right.

636
00:21:26,140 --> 00:21:27,500
 - And they used it for everything, right?

637
00:21:27,500 --> 00:21:29,700
 They used it for lubricant, for waterproofing,

638
00:21:29,700 --> 00:21:31,940
 for all cosmetics are made of beeswax.

639
00:21:31,940 --> 00:21:33,540
 They didn't really have any other materials

640
00:21:33,540 --> 00:21:34,740
 except beeswax, practically.

641
00:21:34,740 --> 00:21:36,540
 - The other reason it was so good in church is,

642
00:21:36,540 --> 00:21:40,380
 is because they thought that bees were virgin born,

643
00:21:40,380 --> 00:21:41,740
 like Jesus.

644
00:21:41,740 --> 00:21:42,580
 - Oh.

645
00:21:42,580 --> 00:21:43,420
 - There was this thing.

646
00:21:43,420 --> 00:21:46,380
 And if you own bees and you look in your beehive,

647
00:21:46,380 --> 00:21:47,580
 they never have sex.

648
00:21:47,580 --> 00:21:50,500
 You can sit there watching them as long as you want, Dan.

649
00:21:50,500 --> 00:21:52,020
 They will not have sex.

650
00:21:52,020 --> 00:21:56,620
 Because they go, they kind of find a little region

651
00:21:56,620 --> 00:21:59,380
 and they all fly, all the drones fly to this little region

652
00:21:59,380 --> 00:22:01,820
 and then the queen flies there as well.

653
00:22:01,820 --> 00:22:03,900
 And then they have sex in the air while they're flying.

654
00:22:03,900 --> 00:22:05,340
 And then they all come back.

655
00:22:05,340 --> 00:22:06,780
 So no one ever saw them have sex

656
00:22:06,780 --> 00:22:07,980
 or they thought they were virgins.

657
00:22:07,980 --> 00:22:09,420
 - But that's the same as humans.

658
00:22:09,420 --> 00:22:11,740
 I never see humans have sex because very similarly,

659
00:22:11,740 --> 00:22:15,220
 they go to a special place where I'm not allowed

660
00:22:15,220 --> 00:22:17,340
 and they have sex there.

661
00:22:17,340 --> 00:22:19,140
 I don't assume everyone's a virgin

662
00:22:19,140 --> 00:22:22,060
 just because I haven't seen any of them shagging.

663
00:22:22,060 --> 00:22:24,180
 People were stupid in the middle ages, weren't they?

664
00:22:24,180 --> 00:22:25,100
 - Wow.

665
00:22:25,100 --> 00:22:28,100
 Can I tell you a thing about ancient Roman beeswax?

666
00:22:28,100 --> 00:22:28,940
 This is so cool.

667
00:22:28,940 --> 00:22:29,780
 Okay, I love this.

668
00:22:29,780 --> 00:22:33,980
 So you would have a wax mast made of yourself

669
00:22:33,980 --> 00:22:35,740
 and it was for use in life,

670
00:22:35,740 --> 00:22:37,580
 but it was also for use at your funeral.

671
00:22:37,580 --> 00:22:39,100
 - What would you use it for in life?

672
00:22:39,100 --> 00:22:39,940
 - I'm getting onto that.

673
00:22:39,940 --> 00:22:40,780
 Jesus.

674
00:22:40,780 --> 00:22:43,300
 - Sorry, you went straight to death.

675
00:22:43,300 --> 00:22:44,380
 - Sorry, sorry, sorry.

676
00:22:44,380 --> 00:22:45,980
 But it's all connected, that's the weird thing.

677
00:22:45,980 --> 00:22:50,100
 So about the age we all are, about 35 to 40,

678
00:22:50,100 --> 00:22:52,100
 you would have a wax mask made of yourself

679
00:22:52,100 --> 00:22:54,740
 and when you had reached political high office,

680
00:22:54,740 --> 00:22:57,220
 that's the four of us all have, sure,

681
00:22:57,220 --> 00:22:58,580
 you would have them in your hall,

682
00:22:58,580 --> 00:23:01,180
 but you would also have your ancestors wax masks,

683
00:23:01,180 --> 00:23:03,340
 normally male ones, but often some female ones too,

684
00:23:03,340 --> 00:23:05,700
 if you're a very politically connected family.

685
00:23:05,700 --> 00:23:08,420
 And at a funeral, you would hire a load of men

686
00:23:08,420 --> 00:23:12,540
 to wear these masks and pretend to be your male ancestors.

687
00:23:12,540 --> 00:23:13,820
 And if it was your funeral,

688
00:23:13,820 --> 00:23:16,620
 someone would be wearing a mask of you at your funeral,

689
00:23:16,620 --> 00:23:21,060
 dressed as you, dressed as the highest office you've achieved,

690
00:23:21,060 --> 00:23:25,540
 they would wear like a podcaster uniform or whatever.

691
00:23:25,540 --> 00:23:27,580
 - Is this the highest office we're gonna achieve?

692
00:23:27,580 --> 00:23:29,140
 - I'm afraid so.

693
00:23:29,140 --> 00:23:30,860
 - Yeah, they would take the piss out of you a bit as well,

694
00:23:30,860 --> 00:23:31,700
 wouldn't they?

695
00:23:31,700 --> 00:23:32,540
 - They would.

696
00:23:32,540 --> 00:23:33,980
 - I think they would wear this mask and wear your clothes

697
00:23:33,980 --> 00:23:35,740
 and then go up to your friends and go,

698
00:23:35,740 --> 00:23:36,940
 "Oh, I'm an idiot."

699
00:23:36,940 --> 00:23:39,380
 - That's quite nice.

700
00:23:39,380 --> 00:23:40,340
 Why did we stop doing it?

701
00:23:40,340 --> 00:23:41,180
 - I don't know.

702
00:23:41,180 --> 00:23:42,020
 - And then we should bring it back.

703
00:23:42,020 --> 00:23:45,060
 - The fall of Rome, yet again, screwing everything up.

704
00:23:45,060 --> 00:23:47,380
 But the other thing you would have in your front hall,

705
00:23:47,380 --> 00:23:48,860
 you would have this wall of faces,

706
00:23:48,860 --> 00:23:50,620
 like here are my male ancestors,

707
00:23:50,620 --> 00:23:52,500
 you would have a wall of your family tree,

708
00:23:52,500 --> 00:23:55,100
 and you would have a wall of military spoils

709
00:23:55,100 --> 00:23:57,380
 that your family had seized in battle.

710
00:23:57,380 --> 00:23:58,860
 So as someone came into your front hall,

711
00:23:58,860 --> 00:24:00,700
 they would get the full works of like,

712
00:24:00,700 --> 00:24:03,220
 "Here is what a great kind of guy I am."

713
00:24:03,220 --> 00:24:04,060
 - Nice.

714
00:24:04,060 --> 00:24:07,180
 - Hey, actually, back to candles and sex,

715
00:24:07,180 --> 00:24:08,420
 were we talking about that at all?

716
00:24:08,420 --> 00:24:09,540
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

717
00:24:09,540 --> 00:24:11,700
 - Have you guys read about brothel candles?

718
00:24:11,700 --> 00:24:12,540
 - No.

719
00:24:12,540 --> 00:24:13,740
 - I think I can guess what they are.

720
00:24:13,740 --> 00:24:15,300
 - Yeah, so this is interesting.

721
00:24:15,300 --> 00:24:16,860
 This is around the 1880s,

722
00:24:16,860 --> 00:24:19,260
 and it was into the early 1900s.

723
00:24:19,260 --> 00:24:22,180
 The idea was that in the brothel itself,

724
00:24:22,180 --> 00:24:24,500
 every sex worker there would have a candle

725
00:24:24,500 --> 00:24:26,640
 that would burn down in seven minutes,

726
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:28,700
 and that's how you knew when the session was over.

727
00:24:28,700 --> 00:24:30,020
 - That's a lot of pressure,

728
00:24:30,020 --> 00:24:32,060
 which you don't want, do you?

729
00:24:32,060 --> 00:24:33,180
 That's gonna ruin it.

730
00:24:33,180 --> 00:24:36,700
 I mean, you know,

731
00:24:36,700 --> 00:24:38,180
 I'm not asking you personally down,

732
00:24:38,180 --> 00:24:40,660
 and I don't want to know the answer.

733
00:24:40,660 --> 00:24:42,820
 - You got any seven second candles?

734
00:24:42,820 --> 00:24:45,060
 (laughing)

735
00:24:45,060 --> 00:24:47,640
 (upbeat music)

736
00:24:47,640 --> 00:24:53,220
 - It is time for fact number three,

737
00:24:53,220 --> 00:24:54,940
 and that is James.

738
00:24:54,940 --> 00:24:56,540
 - Okay, my fact this week

739
00:24:56,540 --> 00:25:00,100
 is that the first known example of mastitis

740
00:25:00,100 --> 00:25:03,060
 was in an empress called a tosser.

741
00:25:03,060 --> 00:25:04,860
 (laughing)

742
00:25:04,860 --> 00:25:06,260
 She was cured,

743
00:25:06,260 --> 00:25:08,500
 and the doctor's payment was to be allowed

744
00:25:08,500 --> 00:25:10,140
 to invade Greece.

745
00:25:10,140 --> 00:25:12,380
 (laughing)

746
00:25:12,380 --> 00:25:17,340
 - Yeah, so we're talking the Achaemenid Empire,

747
00:25:17,340 --> 00:25:19,180
 as I'm sure you all know,

748
00:25:19,180 --> 00:25:22,140
 based in Iran in the fifth century BC.

749
00:25:22,140 --> 00:25:24,500
 They were the biggest empire in the world at the time,

750
00:25:24,500 --> 00:25:27,380
 and then eventually they went on and fought the Greeks,

751
00:25:27,380 --> 00:25:30,800
 and if you know that movie, The 300, I think it's called,

752
00:25:30,800 --> 00:25:32,220
 - It's a documentary, isn't it?

753
00:25:32,220 --> 00:25:33,900
 - It's a documentary.

754
00:25:33,900 --> 00:25:35,780
 Well, it's about 300 Spartans

755
00:25:35,780 --> 00:25:37,500
 who fought against all these Persians,

756
00:25:37,500 --> 00:25:40,140
 and these are the bad guys in that movie.

757
00:25:40,140 --> 00:25:43,500
 - Oh, yes, they got a very, very bad rap,

758
00:25:43,500 --> 00:25:45,100
 the Persians in this film,

759
00:25:45,100 --> 00:25:49,780
 as in the portrayal as being really dreadful types.

760
00:25:49,780 --> 00:25:51,940
 - Well, they were like, I haven't seen the movie,

761
00:25:51,940 --> 00:25:54,580
 but they're like, they were super soldiers.

762
00:25:54,580 --> 00:25:56,220
 - Normally when you say, I haven't seen the movie,

763
00:25:56,220 --> 00:25:57,780
 it's 'cause we're talking about quite a good movie,

764
00:25:57,780 --> 00:26:01,500
 and you absolutely don't have to watch 300.

765
00:26:01,500 --> 00:26:02,340
 - That's good to know.

766
00:26:02,340 --> 00:26:04,180
 I haven't watched the first 299,

767
00:26:04,180 --> 00:26:06,980
 so I wouldn't know what was happening anyway.

768
00:26:06,980 --> 00:26:11,660
 - So, Etosse, she was the daughter of King Cyrus the Great,

769
00:26:11,660 --> 00:26:14,220
 she was the wife of Darius the Great,

770
00:26:14,220 --> 00:26:16,620
 and she was the mother of Xerxes the Great.

771
00:26:16,620 --> 00:26:18,340
 - Okay.

772
00:26:18,340 --> 00:26:20,580
 - So, behind every great man, there was Etosse.

773
00:26:20,580 --> 00:26:23,980
 (audience laughing)

774
00:26:23,980 --> 00:26:26,740
 And she was like, a lot of what we know about her

775
00:26:26,740 --> 00:26:28,260
 was written by Herodotus,

776
00:26:28,260 --> 00:26:31,620
 and he basically put her as the power behind the throne

777
00:26:31,620 --> 00:26:33,300
 in all these different situations.

778
00:26:33,300 --> 00:26:34,140
 - And he was Greek.

779
00:26:34,140 --> 00:26:36,420
 - And he was Greek, so he was writing about them, yeah.

780
00:26:36,420 --> 00:26:40,900
 - Yeah, she was also a wife twice, right?

781
00:26:40,900 --> 00:26:43,180
 - Three, I think.

782
00:26:43,180 --> 00:26:45,420
 - Okay, but she married her brother at one point, didn't she?

783
00:26:45,420 --> 00:26:46,580
 - She did marry her brother.

784
00:26:46,580 --> 00:26:47,900
 - Not her choice.

785
00:26:47,900 --> 00:26:48,740
 - No.

786
00:26:48,740 --> 00:26:49,580
 - His choice.

787
00:26:49,580 --> 00:26:50,420
 - His choice.

788
00:26:50,420 --> 00:26:51,780
 It was kind of a dumb thing at the time,

789
00:26:51,780 --> 00:26:55,940
 and her brother was basically trying to get the empire,

790
00:26:55,940 --> 00:26:57,180
 and he thought that this,

791
00:26:57,180 --> 00:26:59,620
 a bit like the Egyptians would sometimes marry brothers

792
00:26:59,620 --> 00:27:02,420
 and sisters because it would make them a stronger unit.

793
00:27:02,420 --> 00:27:05,260
 - Well, I think it was illegal to do that.

794
00:27:05,260 --> 00:27:07,300
 - It wasn't, he made it legal.

795
00:27:07,300 --> 00:27:08,740
 - Yeah, that's a good thing about being king,

796
00:27:08,740 --> 00:27:10,940
 and he actually married two of his sisters, didn't he?

797
00:27:10,940 --> 00:27:12,740
 He married her and another sister,

798
00:27:12,740 --> 00:27:14,500
 and I think he might have married his niece

799
00:27:14,500 --> 00:27:15,340
 at one point as well.

800
00:27:15,340 --> 00:27:17,900
 - Wait, was that, was that Cambyses, just to be?

801
00:27:17,900 --> 00:27:18,740
 - Yeah, Cambyses, yeah.

802
00:27:18,740 --> 00:27:20,100
 - The first husband of a tosser.

803
00:27:20,100 --> 00:27:20,940
 - Yeah.

804
00:27:20,940 --> 00:27:21,760
 - Okay.

805
00:27:21,760 --> 00:27:22,600
 - But you were quite limited,

806
00:27:22,600 --> 00:27:24,060
 because if you belonged to one of the noble,

807
00:27:24,060 --> 00:27:26,500
 poshest families, or the royal family at that time,

808
00:27:26,500 --> 00:27:29,620
 you could only marry someone from the seven,

809
00:27:29,620 --> 00:27:31,300
 which is such a cool thing to be a member of,

810
00:27:31,300 --> 00:27:33,780
 and it was the seven most important families.

811
00:27:33,780 --> 00:27:35,380
 - So it was a small pool.

812
00:27:35,380 --> 00:27:37,540
 - I think Snow White had the same issue, didn't she?

813
00:27:37,540 --> 00:27:39,800
 (laughing)

814
00:27:39,800 --> 00:27:44,460
 - But then Cambyses, the brother, went away,

815
00:27:44,460 --> 00:27:47,340
 and their brother, Bardia, usurped the throne.

816
00:27:47,340 --> 00:27:50,660
 This is all kind of very, very late gossip of the,

817
00:27:50,660 --> 00:27:51,500
 how's it pronounced?

818
00:27:51,500 --> 00:27:52,460
 Akameneid?

819
00:27:52,460 --> 00:27:53,300
 - The Akimeneid.

820
00:27:53,300 --> 00:27:54,140
 - Or Persian.

821
00:27:54,140 --> 00:27:54,980
 - Just call it the Persian.

822
00:27:54,980 --> 00:27:56,580
 - Persian, the Persian empire.

823
00:27:56,580 --> 00:27:59,300
 But then the person, Darius the Great,

824
00:27:59,300 --> 00:28:01,980
 was the one who became her big deal husband,

825
00:28:01,980 --> 00:28:06,580
 and he assassinated Bardia, who was the usurper.

826
00:28:06,580 --> 00:28:08,980
 And then to sort of cement his control of power,

827
00:28:08,980 --> 00:28:13,580
 he married all Cyrus the Great's female descendants.

828
00:28:13,580 --> 00:28:14,420
 - Yeah.

829
00:28:14,420 --> 00:28:16,380
 - As in just, he married the whole family.

830
00:28:16,380 --> 00:28:17,220
 - It was a different time.

831
00:28:17,220 --> 00:28:18,660
 - It was a different time.

832
00:28:18,660 --> 00:28:20,620
 - Not so many trees in Persia.

833
00:28:20,620 --> 00:28:21,460
 - No.

834
00:28:21,460 --> 00:28:22,700
 (laughing)

835
00:28:22,700 --> 00:28:24,660
 - Yeah, they were brutal, though, weren't they,

836
00:28:24,660 --> 00:28:27,140
 the Persians, with the torture that they did.

837
00:28:27,140 --> 00:28:28,100
 - Oh, really?

838
00:28:28,100 --> 00:28:30,180
 - Well, it's just the examples are wild.

839
00:28:30,180 --> 00:28:32,820
 Like, I was reading about, so Cambyses,

840
00:28:32,820 --> 00:28:36,540
 he had a judge who had done some behind the scenes stuff

841
00:28:36,540 --> 00:28:38,180
 that he was unhappy with.

842
00:28:38,180 --> 00:28:42,100
 And so he basically had this judge killed,

843
00:28:42,100 --> 00:28:44,500
 and then stripped of his skin,

844
00:28:44,500 --> 00:28:47,060
 and then to remind any next judge

845
00:28:47,060 --> 00:28:49,940
 not to do all the bad stuff that this guy had done,

846
00:28:49,940 --> 00:28:53,620
 they laid the strips of his skin over the judge's chair

847
00:28:53,620 --> 00:28:55,220
 that the next judge had to sit on, right?

848
00:28:55,220 --> 00:28:59,100
 So the next judge was sitting on the previous judge.

849
00:28:59,100 --> 00:28:59,940
 - Wow.

850
00:28:59,940 --> 00:29:02,460
 - And the next judge was the son of the previous judge.

851
00:29:02,460 --> 00:29:03,500
 - Oh, no.

852
00:29:03,500 --> 00:29:05,260
 - By the way, so weird that the groan came

853
00:29:05,260 --> 00:29:06,980
 only when I said the son had to sit

854
00:29:06,980 --> 00:29:09,140
 on the skin of the guitar.

855
00:29:09,140 --> 00:29:11,740
 - But is it possible that this is a load

856
00:29:11,740 --> 00:29:13,700
 of kind of Greek-y propaganda?

857
00:29:13,700 --> 00:29:15,940
 'Cause I think most, like loads of what we know about Persia

858
00:29:15,940 --> 00:29:18,860
 comes from historians like Herodotus, who were Greek,

859
00:29:18,860 --> 00:29:21,540
 and had a good reason for--

860
00:29:21,540 --> 00:29:22,780
 - That is true.

861
00:29:22,780 --> 00:29:25,380
 - In fact, a tosser who is written about

862
00:29:25,380 --> 00:29:29,580
 as the most important powerful female member

863
00:29:29,580 --> 00:29:34,500
 of the Achaemenid Empire, also maybe didn't exist.

864
00:29:34,500 --> 00:29:36,220
 Maybe, so-- - Wow, why?

865
00:29:36,220 --> 00:29:39,740
 - Well, she's the only sources we have are Herodotus,

866
00:29:39,740 --> 00:29:41,420
 who famously made up a lot of shit.

867
00:29:41,420 --> 00:29:43,860
 I sometimes like to think that Herodotus just made it all up,

868
00:29:43,860 --> 00:29:45,820
 and basically everything we know

869
00:29:45,820 --> 00:29:48,580
 about Greek and Persian history is just from his head.

870
00:29:48,580 --> 00:29:50,660
 But I think it's Herodotus, an Aeschylus play

871
00:29:50,660 --> 00:29:53,340
 that mentioned her, but so it could be.

872
00:29:53,340 --> 00:29:55,260
 - Well, we know that Darius existed.

873
00:29:55,260 --> 00:29:56,500
 - Definitely, and Cyrus the Great--

874
00:29:56,500 --> 00:29:58,340
 - I think Cyrus existed, and Xerxes existed.

875
00:29:58,340 --> 00:30:00,860
 - 100%, Cyrus the Great was great, by the way.

876
00:30:00,860 --> 00:30:01,700
 - Oh, yeah.

877
00:30:01,700 --> 00:30:04,660
 - You know, you read about old kings, emperors, et cetera,

878
00:30:04,660 --> 00:30:05,780
 and they're all bastards.

879
00:30:05,780 --> 00:30:08,180
 Cyrus the Great, he's one of those annoying people,

880
00:30:08,180 --> 00:30:11,140
 he's just a good, all-round guy.

881
00:30:11,140 --> 00:30:13,180
 He's just constantly doing nice stuff,

882
00:30:13,180 --> 00:30:15,460
 so he forgave people constantly.

883
00:30:15,460 --> 00:30:18,220
 He was very famous for when he invaded somewhere,

884
00:30:18,220 --> 00:30:20,860
 he'd, instead of killing people or taking them prisoner,

885
00:30:20,860 --> 00:30:22,820
 he'd draw them into his bureaucracy

886
00:30:22,820 --> 00:30:24,540
 or into the top of his military.

887
00:30:24,540 --> 00:30:26,380
 He was the grandson of this guy.

888
00:30:26,380 --> 00:30:27,540
 - What a nice guy.

889
00:30:27,540 --> 00:30:28,380
 (laughing)

890
00:30:28,380 --> 00:30:29,220
 - What, that is nice.

891
00:30:29,220 --> 00:30:32,380
 - I've taken over your entire country.

892
00:30:32,380 --> 00:30:33,980
 I'm gonna let you join my side.

893
00:30:33,980 --> 00:30:35,340
 - It was a different time.

894
00:30:35,340 --> 00:30:36,380
 - It was a different time.

895
00:30:36,380 --> 00:30:37,220
 - It is a different time.

896
00:30:37,220 --> 00:30:39,700
 - It was, that meant good in those days.

897
00:30:39,700 --> 00:30:41,780
 He famously captured Babylon.

898
00:30:41,780 --> 00:30:43,420
 He did it quite cleverly at night,

899
00:30:43,420 --> 00:30:47,700
 so he overnight managed to divert the whole river Euphrates

900
00:30:47,700 --> 00:30:50,420
 into a canal so that his soldiers could just walk

901
00:30:50,420 --> 00:30:54,220
 across a riverbed, and so he arrived in Babylon.

902
00:30:54,220 --> 00:30:56,220
 Everyone in Babylon woke up and gave up,

903
00:30:56,220 --> 00:30:57,740
 well, oh my God, how did you get here?

904
00:30:57,740 --> 00:30:59,220
 And he released all the Jews there,

905
00:30:59,220 --> 00:31:01,380
 had been taken captive there,

906
00:31:01,380 --> 00:31:03,700
 and said, you know, said you can go back to Jerusalem,

907
00:31:03,700 --> 00:31:05,300
 so Jewish people loved him.

908
00:31:05,300 --> 00:31:08,700
 He defeated his grandpa, who tried to murder him,

909
00:31:08,700 --> 00:31:10,780
 and immediately forgave him,

910
00:31:10,780 --> 00:31:12,980
 although I think he killed all of his grandpa's kids,

911
00:31:12,980 --> 00:31:14,180
 'cause they might be threats.

912
00:31:14,180 --> 00:31:15,500
 But every good guy--

913
00:31:15,500 --> 00:31:16,820
 - Does that include his dad?

914
00:31:16,820 --> 00:31:21,100
 - I don't think it did include his dad, no.

915
00:31:21,100 --> 00:31:22,460
 He didn't include his own dad.

916
00:31:22,460 --> 00:31:25,340
 - You really, the more you talk about this Cyrus guy,

917
00:31:25,340 --> 00:31:26,940
 the less unconvinced you--

918
00:31:26,940 --> 00:31:29,020
 - Yeah, he was the guy who started this army

919
00:31:29,020 --> 00:31:32,500
 that's in the 300, and they were known as the Immortals,

920
00:31:32,500 --> 00:31:35,260
 and there were 10,000 of them in this army.

921
00:31:35,260 --> 00:31:36,540
 And the way that they did it was,

922
00:31:36,540 --> 00:31:41,540
 if ever any of them got killed or injured or a bit sick

923
00:31:41,540 --> 00:31:44,340
 or just didn't fancy it, then they would go off,

924
00:31:44,340 --> 00:31:45,820
 they would take them off the battlefield

925
00:31:45,820 --> 00:31:47,980
 and immediately replace them with someone else.

926
00:31:47,980 --> 00:31:48,820
 - Right.

927
00:31:48,820 --> 00:31:51,180
 - So as far as you're concerned, the enemy,

928
00:31:51,180 --> 00:31:53,020
 there are always 10,000 of them,

929
00:31:53,020 --> 00:31:54,980
 and so you think they are immortal.

930
00:31:54,980 --> 00:31:57,820
 - Can you just tap out by raising a hand?

931
00:31:57,820 --> 00:31:58,820
 (all laughing)

932
00:31:58,820 --> 00:32:00,100
 I've really had a great time.

933
00:32:00,100 --> 00:32:03,660
 I've met a lot of friends, but I'm done.

934
00:32:03,660 --> 00:32:04,620
 - Is it like NFL?

935
00:32:04,620 --> 00:32:05,860
 Is that what they do in NFL?

936
00:32:05,860 --> 00:32:07,180
 - Oh yeah, bring on the offense.

937
00:32:07,180 --> 00:32:08,700
 I think they're all offense in this case.

938
00:32:08,700 --> 00:32:09,860
 (all laughing)

939
00:32:09,860 --> 00:32:11,820
 They were tiaras.

940
00:32:11,820 --> 00:32:14,940
 They were called tiaras, but they were actually felt caps.

941
00:32:14,940 --> 00:32:15,780
 - Right.

942
00:32:15,780 --> 00:32:18,340
 - And the main thing they used was a spear,

943
00:32:18,340 --> 00:32:19,780
 and it was a really long spear,

944
00:32:19,780 --> 00:32:22,420
 and they had a counterbalance at the end of the spear,

945
00:32:22,420 --> 00:32:25,020
 and the counterbalance would be a different type of fruit,

946
00:32:25,020 --> 00:32:27,220
 depending on how good you were.

947
00:32:27,220 --> 00:32:28,940
 So the best possible thing you could have

948
00:32:28,940 --> 00:32:31,620
 was a little like an apple at the end of your spear,

949
00:32:31,620 --> 00:32:33,900
 and then you were part of the apple regiment.

950
00:32:33,900 --> 00:32:35,580
 - Well, 'cause that meant you had to suspend

951
00:32:35,580 --> 00:32:37,020
 more weight at the front,

952
00:32:37,020 --> 00:32:38,540
 or as if you had like a watermelon.

953
00:32:38,540 --> 00:32:40,660
 - Yeah, so the counterbalance was so that you could have

954
00:32:40,660 --> 00:32:42,740
 a longer spear and it wouldn't dip down,

955
00:32:42,740 --> 00:32:45,220
 but actually the weight of the thing would always be the same,

956
00:32:45,220 --> 00:32:46,740
 it would just be in the shape of an apple

957
00:32:46,740 --> 00:32:49,020
 or a banana or a grape or something.

958
00:32:49,020 --> 00:32:49,940
 - That's nice.

959
00:32:49,940 --> 00:32:51,660
 - I'm trying to think of a really shit fruit

960
00:32:51,660 --> 00:32:55,260
 if you had a raspberry or something on the end, or...

961
00:32:55,260 --> 00:32:58,380
 - They were kind of famously luxury-loving the Persians,

962
00:32:58,380 --> 00:32:59,900
 and this again is a lot of propaganda

963
00:32:59,900 --> 00:33:01,140
 that was dished out by the Greeks.

964
00:33:01,140 --> 00:33:03,700
 Basically, the Greeks kept saying,

965
00:33:03,700 --> 00:33:05,020
 "These people wear trousers,

966
00:33:05,020 --> 00:33:07,940
 "they're just too addicted to luxury."

967
00:33:07,940 --> 00:33:09,580
 (audience laughing)

968
00:33:09,580 --> 00:33:11,660
 Genuinely, that was an example that is...

969
00:33:11,660 --> 00:33:13,620
 Their kings have parasols.

970
00:33:13,620 --> 00:33:15,260
 Embarrassing.

971
00:33:15,260 --> 00:33:17,180
 A servant has to shade your king with a little umbrella.

972
00:33:17,180 --> 00:33:20,100
 It's a little bit weak, so there was a lot of that.

973
00:33:20,100 --> 00:33:23,660
 But one of the great things they had in the Persian Empire,

974
00:33:23,660 --> 00:33:27,100
 post, so as I look at this,

975
00:33:27,100 --> 00:33:28,900
 it's now less exciting than I think it...

976
00:33:28,900 --> 00:33:31,740
 (audience laughing)

977
00:33:31,740 --> 00:33:33,380
 I think it's just really interesting.

978
00:33:33,380 --> 00:33:35,740
 They have an amazing postal system.

979
00:33:35,740 --> 00:33:37,620
 Sometimes you look down at a note,

980
00:33:37,620 --> 00:33:38,940
 the confidence just drains,

981
00:33:38,940 --> 00:33:40,420
 like all the blood drains from the face.

982
00:33:40,420 --> 00:33:42,420
 (audience laughing)

983
00:33:42,420 --> 00:33:44,780
 - Did they have a morning and afternoon post, Andy?

984
00:33:44,780 --> 00:33:45,940
 (audience laughing)

985
00:33:45,940 --> 00:33:47,660
 James, they had so many posts.

986
00:33:47,660 --> 00:33:49,420
 Honestly, they make the current post office look

987
00:33:49,420 --> 00:33:50,420
 absolute dog shit.

988
00:33:50,420 --> 00:33:51,260
 They were just...

989
00:33:51,260 --> 00:33:52,780
 (audience laughing)

990
00:33:52,780 --> 00:33:55,060
 Like a huge empire, so you have to get stuff,

991
00:33:55,060 --> 00:33:57,020
 you know, like thousands of kilometers.

992
00:33:57,020 --> 00:33:58,780
 - Yeah, so it went basically all the way to the Balkans,

993
00:33:58,780 --> 00:34:00,580
 like where Albania is today,

994
00:34:00,580 --> 00:34:02,780
 all the way to the edge of where Iran is today.

995
00:34:02,780 --> 00:34:03,740
 So it's absolutely massive.

996
00:34:03,740 --> 00:34:05,140
 - Exactly, and they had this amazing thing called

997
00:34:05,140 --> 00:34:07,180
 the Royal Road, which was basically only allowed

998
00:34:07,180 --> 00:34:09,260
 for the use of posties and the army.

999
00:34:09,260 --> 00:34:11,380
 And to go all the way from Western Iran

1000
00:34:11,380 --> 00:34:13,020
 to what is now Western Turkey,

1001
00:34:13,020 --> 00:34:14,300
 a place called Sardis,

1002
00:34:14,300 --> 00:34:15,700
 two and a half thousand kilometers,

1003
00:34:15,700 --> 00:34:17,220
 on foot it would take three months,

1004
00:34:17,220 --> 00:34:18,860
 they could get posted in a week.

1005
00:34:18,860 --> 00:34:20,220
 - Right, so amazing. - So that genuinely

1006
00:34:20,220 --> 00:34:22,580
 was amazing, and it was the fastest land travel system

1007
00:34:22,580 --> 00:34:24,020
 in the world at the time,

1008
00:34:24,020 --> 00:34:26,180
 'cause it relied on very, very fast horse relays.

1009
00:34:26,180 --> 00:34:28,180
 You would just ride a horse for, you know,

1010
00:34:28,180 --> 00:34:30,700
 as long as it could go, and as soon as it stopped,

1011
00:34:30,700 --> 00:34:32,500
 another horseman would take the post and go on.

1012
00:34:32,500 --> 00:34:35,260
 - Yes, and the stations were set up for that, weren't they?

1013
00:34:35,260 --> 00:34:37,380
 So Cyrus, when he set up the post stations,

1014
00:34:37,380 --> 00:34:38,940
 worked out exactly how long the horse

1015
00:34:38,940 --> 00:34:41,060
 can go at full speed before it just collapses,

1016
00:34:41,060 --> 00:34:42,820
 and then where the horse is fainted,

1017
00:34:42,820 --> 00:34:44,340
 he builds a little post office.

1018
00:34:44,340 --> 00:34:45,260
 - Lovely man. - And then he's like,

1019
00:34:45,260 --> 00:34:48,140
 "Leave the next horse here, a nice guy."

1020
00:34:48,140 --> 00:34:50,300
 - I should just explain the fact.

1021
00:34:50,300 --> 00:34:51,380
 - Oh yeah. - That he started with.

1022
00:34:51,380 --> 00:34:52,740
 - Oh yeah. - This doctor,

1023
00:34:52,740 --> 00:34:54,380
 who was allowed to invade Greece.

1024
00:34:54,380 --> 00:34:56,660
 So he was called Demosides,

1025
00:34:56,660 --> 00:34:59,540
 and he'd been previously taken as a slave in a raid,

1026
00:34:59,540 --> 00:35:02,900
 and he'd found himself in this Achaemenid empire.

1027
00:35:02,900 --> 00:35:07,900
 And Darius the Great, who was a tosser's husband,

1028
00:35:07,900 --> 00:35:10,380
 he had broken his ankle, right?

1029
00:35:10,380 --> 00:35:11,580
 He'd fallen off his horse,

1030
00:35:11,580 --> 00:35:13,940
 and really actually dislocated his ankle.

1031
00:35:13,940 --> 00:35:16,580
 And all of his doctors tried to help him,

1032
00:35:16,580 --> 00:35:17,980
 and the way they tried to help him

1033
00:35:17,980 --> 00:35:20,460
 was basically yanking him around,

1034
00:35:20,460 --> 00:35:21,620
 and pulling him up and down,

1035
00:35:21,620 --> 00:35:23,460
 and hopefully it would get back in place.

1036
00:35:23,460 --> 00:35:25,060
 - Right. - And he absolutely hated it.

1037
00:35:25,060 --> 00:35:27,580
 He was unable to sleep, he was in so much pain.

1038
00:35:27,580 --> 00:35:29,140
 But he found this guy, Demosides,

1039
00:35:29,140 --> 00:35:31,020
 who had been taken as a slave,

1040
00:35:31,020 --> 00:35:33,660
 and this guy was a doctor.

1041
00:35:33,660 --> 00:35:36,540
 And Demosides made his leg better,

1042
00:35:36,540 --> 00:35:40,260
 and to say thank you,

1043
00:35:40,260 --> 00:35:43,700
 he gave him two sets of golden shackles.

1044
00:35:43,700 --> 00:35:45,180
 So he was basically saying,

1045
00:35:45,180 --> 00:35:48,820
 "You're still enslaved, but at least you've got gold now."

1046
00:35:48,820 --> 00:35:49,940
 - Nice. - Oh, wow.

1047
00:35:49,940 --> 00:35:54,300
 - Anyway, so then Demosides becomes very popular.

1048
00:35:54,300 --> 00:35:57,220
 A tosser gets his boil on her breast.

1049
00:35:57,220 --> 00:36:00,820
 We think now it's mastitis because he managed to cure her,

1050
00:36:00,820 --> 00:36:02,420
 and he wouldn't be able to do any surgery,

1051
00:36:02,420 --> 00:36:03,740
 and she lived quite a long age,

1052
00:36:03,740 --> 00:36:05,660
 so we think it probably was mastitis.

1053
00:36:05,660 --> 00:36:08,100
 He manages to cure her, and he says,

1054
00:36:08,100 --> 00:36:11,420
 "I will only cure you if you give me anything in return."

1055
00:36:11,420 --> 00:36:12,540
 She says, "Fine."

1056
00:36:12,540 --> 00:36:16,100
 He says, "Well, let me go to Greece as part of a raid."

1057
00:36:16,100 --> 00:36:18,020
 And then when he gets to Greece, he escapes,

1058
00:36:18,020 --> 00:36:19,580
 because that's where he was from originally

1059
00:36:19,580 --> 00:36:21,140
 when he was enslaved. - Oh, yeah.

1060
00:36:21,140 --> 00:36:22,420
 - So that's kind of the story.

1061
00:36:22,420 --> 00:36:25,700
 - And he goes back to Croton, which is where he was from,

1062
00:36:25,700 --> 00:36:27,980
 and he marries the daughter

1063
00:36:27,980 --> 00:36:30,980
 of a really famous wrestler called Milo.

1064
00:36:30,980 --> 00:36:33,260
 And this guy is extraordinary.

1065
00:36:33,260 --> 00:36:34,500
 Have we spoken about him before?

1066
00:36:34,500 --> 00:36:35,820
 - I don't think so. - I don't think we have.

1067
00:36:35,820 --> 00:36:40,420
 He was an Olympian. He won six Olympic events in his time,

1068
00:36:40,420 --> 00:36:43,620
 and he was just one of those guys who was so big and massive,

1069
00:36:43,620 --> 00:36:45,940
 he could do feets of strength that almost seemed impossible,

1070
00:36:45,940 --> 00:36:49,380
 so he could hold out his arm with his fingers outstretched

1071
00:36:49,380 --> 00:36:53,700
 and challenge people to attempt to bend his little finger,

1072
00:36:53,700 --> 00:36:54,700
 and they couldn't do it.

1073
00:36:54,700 --> 00:36:56,900
 They would be trying, and he'd be going, "Wah!"

1074
00:36:56,900 --> 00:36:59,140
 He would stand on a greased iron disc

1075
00:36:59,140 --> 00:37:01,140
 and challenge people to push him off it.

1076
00:37:01,140 --> 00:37:03,100
 They never could.

1077
00:37:03,100 --> 00:37:05,220
 He could hold a pomegranate in one hand

1078
00:37:05,220 --> 00:37:07,180
 and challenge others to take it from him.

1079
00:37:07,180 --> 00:37:08,180
 Nobody could.

1080
00:37:08,180 --> 00:37:11,420
 And despite holding it very tightly, it was never damaged.

1081
00:37:11,420 --> 00:37:13,220
 This guy is incredible.

1082
00:37:13,220 --> 00:37:15,540
 And in his off years, he was trained by carrying

1083
00:37:15,540 --> 00:37:18,140
 a newborn calf on his back every day

1084
00:37:18,140 --> 00:37:19,940
 until the Olympics took place,

1085
00:37:19,940 --> 00:37:23,420
 by which time he was carrying a four-year-old cow on his back,

1086
00:37:23,420 --> 00:37:27,020
 and he would carry it the length of the stadium

1087
00:37:27,020 --> 00:37:30,140
 and then kill it, roast it, and eat it as part of like,

1088
00:37:30,140 --> 00:37:33,100
 an intimate, like doing the hacker that the New Zealanders do.

1089
00:37:33,100 --> 00:37:34,740
 It was like his intimidation process.

1090
00:37:34,740 --> 00:37:36,260
 What a life for that cow.

1091
00:37:36,260 --> 00:37:37,260
 What the hell?

1092
00:37:37,260 --> 00:37:38,260
 Incredible.

1093
00:37:38,260 --> 00:37:39,980
 Four years on someone's shoulders and then killed.

1094
00:37:39,980 --> 00:37:40,980
 Yeah, exactly.

1095
00:37:40,980 --> 00:37:42,220
 You'd think you're like best buddies,

1096
00:37:42,220 --> 00:37:43,700
 but then suddenly, yeah.

1097
00:37:43,700 --> 00:37:45,820
 And so then the legend goes that he died

1098
00:37:45,820 --> 00:37:48,380
 when he tried to show one final bit of feeder strength,

1099
00:37:48,380 --> 00:37:51,860
 which was he was passing a man who was chopping a tree,

1100
00:37:51,860 --> 00:37:55,620
 and he said, "I will rip this trunk in half

1101
00:37:55,620 --> 00:37:57,100
 "with my bare hands."

1102
00:37:57,100 --> 00:37:59,340
 And the guy said, "Incredible."

1103
00:37:59,340 --> 00:38:01,860
 He said, "What an honor for you to do that, Milo."

1104
00:38:01,860 --> 00:38:05,140
 And for some reason, the guy then went off while he did it,

1105
00:38:05,140 --> 00:38:07,620
 and as he stretched to separate it,

1106
00:38:07,620 --> 00:38:11,860
 something cracked and his fingers went in and he got stuck,

1107
00:38:11,860 --> 00:38:14,540
 and he just died 'cause the guy didn't come back.

1108
00:38:14,540 --> 00:38:15,620
 Oh, my gosh.

1109
00:38:15,620 --> 00:38:17,820
 But he did win the tree-hugging contest

1110
00:38:17,820 --> 00:38:19,340
 for three years in a row.

1111
00:38:19,340 --> 00:38:28,420
 We're gonna move on to our final fact of the show,

1112
00:38:28,420 --> 00:38:29,460
 and that is my fact.

1113
00:38:29,460 --> 00:38:33,380
 My fact this week is that one way to tell how deep you are

1114
00:38:33,380 --> 00:38:38,140
 when scuba diving is to take a set of snooker balls with you.

1115
00:38:38,140 --> 00:38:41,180
 Is that 'cause you're at the bottom if you've done that?

1116
00:38:41,180 --> 00:38:42,340
 You've sunk to the bottom.

1117
00:38:42,340 --> 00:38:44,020
 Or is it because you're so fat

1118
00:38:44,020 --> 00:38:46,140
 once you can't hear the snooker players going,

1119
00:38:46,140 --> 00:38:48,060
 "Where you going with that balls?"

1120
00:38:48,060 --> 00:38:49,220
 Then you know you're a certain number.

1121
00:38:49,220 --> 00:38:50,100
 No, you're in trouble.

1122
00:38:50,100 --> 00:38:52,420
 No, this is a fascinating thing that I didn't know,

1123
00:38:52,420 --> 00:38:55,460
 which is that as you go lower into the ocean,

1124
00:38:55,460 --> 00:38:57,580
 different bits of color disappear.

1125
00:38:57,580 --> 00:39:00,540
 And so if you had no way of knowing how deep you are,

1126
00:39:00,540 --> 00:39:02,900
 you can consult your snooker balls,

1127
00:39:02,900 --> 00:39:06,220
 and if you can see that your red ball is no longer red,

1128
00:39:06,220 --> 00:39:08,500
 that your yellow ball is no longer yellow,

1129
00:39:08,500 --> 00:39:10,140
 but your green ball is still green,

1130
00:39:10,140 --> 00:39:12,980
 then you know that you're roughly where you are in the ocean.

1131
00:39:12,980 --> 00:39:14,740
 It is genius, Anna, I must say.

1132
00:39:14,740 --> 00:39:16,060
 Fascinating, so this is...

1133
00:39:16,060 --> 00:39:18,260
 It's very inconvenient to have to take a set of snooker balls.

1134
00:39:18,260 --> 00:39:19,700
 No, no, no, Anna.

1135
00:39:19,700 --> 00:39:22,100
 Oh, contraire, because I looked,

1136
00:39:22,100 --> 00:39:26,180
 and the cheapest depth gauge you can get online is £30,

1137
00:39:26,180 --> 00:39:29,460
 but the cheapest set of snooker balls is only £15.

1138
00:39:29,460 --> 00:39:31,460
 There you go. I'll take it back.

1139
00:39:31,460 --> 00:39:33,660
 What if you drop one, and then...

1140
00:39:33,660 --> 00:39:36,220
 You better hope it's a red one.

1141
00:39:36,220 --> 00:39:39,580
 But, like, how will you know what color they are?

1142
00:39:39,580 --> 00:39:41,900
 Because you can still see the colors.

1143
00:39:41,900 --> 00:39:44,180
 So, okay, so say you're going down, say you're going down.

1144
00:39:44,180 --> 00:39:46,820
 At about 20 feet, red stops being red.

1145
00:39:46,820 --> 00:39:49,340
 Okay, so you know all the red balls look grey.

1146
00:39:49,340 --> 00:39:52,820
 Yes, exactly, so you're like, "Ah, I must be about 20 feet down."

1147
00:39:52,820 --> 00:39:55,940
 You go down to 50 feet, orange disappears altogether.

1148
00:39:55,940 --> 00:39:57,700
 "Oh, I must be at 50 feet."

1149
00:39:57,700 --> 00:40:01,060
 You keep going down. "Where's yellow gone? I'm 100 feet deep."

1150
00:40:01,060 --> 00:40:04,660
 So the more you go down, color starts disappearing.

1151
00:40:04,660 --> 00:40:08,540
 And it's fascinating. So, for example, if you were, let's say,

1152
00:40:08,540 --> 00:40:11,900
 50 feet below the ocean, maybe even 100,

1153
00:40:11,900 --> 00:40:15,060
 and you cut yourself, you would bleed green blood,

1154
00:40:15,060 --> 00:40:17,740
 because that color would be morphing towards...

1155
00:40:17,740 --> 00:40:21,300
 So, people... I think it's quite, I think it's even just, like, 10 meters.

1156
00:40:21,300 --> 00:40:23,820
 Because red disappears very fast. Red is a shit color.

1157
00:40:23,820 --> 00:40:27,620
 It's got no energy. It sees one bit of water and disappears into it.

1158
00:40:27,620 --> 00:40:29,980
 And I think on diving websites, it says, like,

1159
00:40:29,980 --> 00:40:33,100
 early scuba divers, if they cut themselves, can get quite shocked,

1160
00:40:33,100 --> 00:40:36,820
 because you're eight meters underwater and you go, "I'm an alien!"

1161
00:40:36,820 --> 00:40:39,140
 But this is the amazing thing.

1162
00:40:39,140 --> 00:40:43,820
 This is why so many fish red, because loads of fish are red,

1163
00:40:43,820 --> 00:40:45,980
 and they're doing it in the deep sea, loads of fish are red,

1164
00:40:45,980 --> 00:40:49,020
 and it's for camouflage, because you can't see red at that depth.

1165
00:40:49,020 --> 00:40:51,740
 So they look grey or black, all the red light has been absorbed.

1166
00:40:51,740 --> 00:40:53,300
 They're basically invisible.

1167
00:40:53,300 --> 00:40:56,620
 But blue is the color that lasts the longest and penetrates the best.

1168
00:40:56,620 --> 00:40:59,300
 So there are very few animals which have big blue bodies.

1169
00:40:59,300 --> 00:41:02,020
 The blue whale is basically so confident.

1170
00:41:02,020 --> 00:41:03,340
 Like, they're none predators.

1171
00:41:03,340 --> 00:41:06,220
 But in the reefs, you get, like, blue and yellow fish, don't you?

1172
00:41:06,220 --> 00:41:08,540
 And the reason is that they want to signal where they are

1173
00:41:08,540 --> 00:41:12,300
 for sexual reasons or something like that, or scare things away.

1174
00:41:12,300 --> 00:41:15,060
 And yellow is the complementary color to blue.

1175
00:41:15,060 --> 00:41:17,900
 So the complementary color to red is green.

1176
00:41:17,900 --> 00:41:19,700
 They really contrast against each other.

1177
00:41:19,700 --> 00:41:21,500
 The complementary color to blue is yellow.

1178
00:41:21,500 --> 00:41:23,860
 So that's why you get lots of blue and yellow fish.

1179
00:41:23,860 --> 00:41:29,380
 But also it means if there were traffic lights in the fish world,

1180
00:41:29,380 --> 00:41:31,340
 there would be no use being red and green,

1181
00:41:31,340 --> 00:41:33,500
 because the red would disappear straight away.

1182
00:41:33,500 --> 00:41:36,740
 They would have to be blue, which is the thing that stands out the most.

1183
00:41:36,740 --> 00:41:39,220
 So the red light would be blue,

1184
00:41:39,220 --> 00:41:41,380
 and the green light would be the complementary color to that,

1185
00:41:41,380 --> 00:41:43,740
 which would be yellow.

1186
00:41:43,740 --> 00:41:46,940
 And if you look at Spongebob Squarepants, they get it wrong.

1187
00:41:46,940 --> 00:41:49,260
 [LAUGHTER]

1188
00:41:49,260 --> 00:41:51,420
 I should quickly say where I got this fact from,

1189
00:41:51,420 --> 00:41:54,020
 because I was reading a novel when we were on tour.

1190
00:41:54,020 --> 00:41:56,780
 We were in Dublin, and I bought this book on the way over,

1191
00:41:56,780 --> 00:41:59,660
 which was "Wailfall" by Daniel Krause.

1192
00:41:59,660 --> 00:42:04,100
 It's a science fiction book, so it's all fictional, but this was in it.

1193
00:42:04,100 --> 00:42:07,340
 And it's the story of a guy who's going scuba diving,

1194
00:42:07,340 --> 00:42:10,020
 and he's accidentally swallowed by a whale.

1195
00:42:10,020 --> 00:42:13,620
 And while he's in the whale, he's still got the scuba gear on him,

1196
00:42:13,620 --> 00:42:15,420
 so he makes it into one of the stomachs,

1197
00:42:15,420 --> 00:42:17,660
 and he knows he has an hour of oxygen left,

1198
00:42:17,660 --> 00:42:21,820
 and it's the story of how he attempts to get out of the whale within an hour.

1199
00:42:21,820 --> 00:42:23,500
 It's one of those books. It's like the Martian...

1200
00:42:23,500 --> 00:42:27,940
 It's proper science trying to work out how to not be digested in a whale stomach.

1201
00:42:27,940 --> 00:42:30,100
 I learned so much despite it being fiction.

1202
00:42:30,100 --> 00:42:33,580
 I know, for example, if you do get swallowed by a whale and you're in its stomach,

1203
00:42:33,580 --> 00:42:35,540
 don't try to escape via the anus.

1204
00:42:35,540 --> 00:42:36,780
 Not going to work for you.

1205
00:42:36,780 --> 00:42:38,340
 You need to go back out the other way.

1206
00:42:38,340 --> 00:42:40,620
 I'm not going to say whether or not he makes it out, but don't do that.

1207
00:42:40,620 --> 00:42:41,940
 Does he try the anus?

1208
00:42:41,940 --> 00:42:43,420
 He does. His initial thought is,

1209
00:42:43,420 --> 00:42:45,860
 "I need to just go all the way out through the end."

1210
00:42:45,860 --> 00:42:47,540
 This guy sounds like an idiot.

1211
00:42:47,540 --> 00:42:48,820
 Well, I think when you're inside...

1212
00:42:48,820 --> 00:42:49,860
 Wait, what's wrong with that?

1213
00:42:49,860 --> 00:42:52,380
 What, because you get digested by the digestive juices?

1214
00:42:52,380 --> 00:42:53,180
 It feels like...

1215
00:42:53,180 --> 00:42:55,940
 What does he discover as a scientifically incorrect reason?

1216
00:42:55,940 --> 00:42:58,620
 One thing is that a whale doesn't want to eat you.

1217
00:42:58,620 --> 00:43:01,620
 It wants you out of it. It's not a nice thing for them.

1218
00:43:01,620 --> 00:43:05,180
 You can see inside a whale because largely it swallows bioluminescence,

1219
00:43:05,180 --> 00:43:08,220
 so actually, you can get sight inside a whale.

1220
00:43:08,220 --> 00:43:09,980
 What you mean it swallows stuff that's bioluminescence?

1221
00:43:09,980 --> 00:43:13,660
 Yeah, exactly. So, it might swallow an octopus that has bioluminescence attached to it,

1222
00:43:13,660 --> 00:43:15,060
 so you can use that as a torch.

1223
00:43:15,060 --> 00:43:18,300
 You can use an octopus as a torch inside a stomach.

1224
00:43:18,300 --> 00:43:20,620
 Oh, my God, I've lost a snooker ball.

1225
00:43:20,620 --> 00:43:26,740
 Did you get 90% of animals in the ocean glow in the dark?

1226
00:43:26,740 --> 00:43:29,180
 Which makes sense because, as we say, all colours go away,

1227
00:43:29,180 --> 00:43:31,540
 so they have to make their own colour.

1228
00:43:31,540 --> 00:43:35,580
 But 90% have fluorescent colours that show up.

1229
00:43:35,580 --> 00:43:37,380
 And as we say, if you don't have fluorescent colours

1230
00:43:37,380 --> 00:43:39,340
 and you want to disguise yourself in your prey,

1231
00:43:39,340 --> 00:43:41,940
 then you're often red or black.

1232
00:43:41,940 --> 00:43:45,540
 But that becomes a problem if you meet a dragonfish,

1233
00:43:45,540 --> 00:43:48,540
 which is the only fish that can actually generate red light.

1234
00:43:48,540 --> 00:43:52,020
 So, the dragonfish knows that it's so deep down

1235
00:43:52,020 --> 00:43:55,060
 that red light can't penetrate, so it brings its own.

1236
00:43:55,060 --> 00:43:58,700
 And it's got these headlights under its eyes,

1237
00:43:58,700 --> 00:44:02,100
 kind of like wall paint, and they flash red.

1238
00:44:02,100 --> 00:44:04,980
 And so, as soon as they land on a fish that's red,

1239
00:44:04,980 --> 00:44:08,260
 that thinks it's completely invisible, it shows up red.

1240
00:44:08,260 --> 00:44:11,380
 The only problem is that red doesn't travel very far in water,

1241
00:44:11,380 --> 00:44:15,540
 so they have to get literally centimetres away from the prey.

1242
00:44:15,540 --> 00:44:17,500
 But they basically have a...

1243
00:44:17,500 --> 00:44:19,780
 They effectively have an invisible torch.

1244
00:44:19,780 --> 00:44:21,860
 Because nothing else can see the red. Nothing else can see it.

1245
00:44:21,860 --> 00:44:24,340
 Only they can see what they're trying to do.

1246
00:44:24,340 --> 00:44:27,700
 Like one of those blue light things that you get, like UV torches, right?

1247
00:44:27,700 --> 00:44:30,020
 Like that. They're very cool.

1248
00:44:30,020 --> 00:44:32,180
 But they can't have an eye test,

1249
00:44:32,180 --> 00:44:34,940
 because if you bring them to the surface, they will explode.

1250
00:44:34,940 --> 00:44:38,380
 LAUGHTER

1251
00:44:38,380 --> 00:44:40,660
 Now, if you could just read the first...

1252
00:44:40,660 --> 00:44:41,980
 Oh, what was that?

1253
00:44:41,980 --> 00:44:45,420
 That's so funny.

1254
00:44:45,420 --> 00:44:49,180
 On sea colour, colour in the sea,

1255
00:44:49,180 --> 00:44:51,100
 oceans used to be pink.

1256
00:44:51,100 --> 00:44:53,420
 And, in fact, the whole world was pink.

1257
00:44:53,420 --> 00:44:54,860
 Is that like a bacteria thing?

1258
00:44:54,860 --> 00:44:57,420
 It is a bacteria thing. Yes.

1259
00:44:57,420 --> 00:44:59,340
 Good guess, Dan.

1260
00:44:59,340 --> 00:45:01,220
 10 points.

1261
00:45:01,220 --> 00:45:02,980
 I'm the only member of this family that gets marked

1262
00:45:02,980 --> 00:45:05,780
 when they say something remotely correct.

1263
00:45:05,780 --> 00:45:07,900
 Well done, you have a star.

1264
00:45:07,900 --> 00:45:10,100
 And how many marks are you up to after 10 years?

1265
00:45:10,100 --> 00:45:13,700
 This is my first one, but it's a good feeling.

1266
00:45:13,700 --> 00:45:15,140
 It's improvement.

1267
00:45:15,140 --> 00:45:17,100
 And this is the revelation quite recently

1268
00:45:17,100 --> 00:45:19,220
 that the world's oldest colour is pink.

1269
00:45:19,220 --> 00:45:22,900
 And this is from researchers who found ancient pink pigments

1270
00:45:22,900 --> 00:45:25,740
 in rocks that were 1.1 billion years old.

1271
00:45:25,740 --> 00:45:28,900
 And so they were over 500 million years older

1272
00:45:28,900 --> 00:45:30,860
 than the second oldest known pigment.

1273
00:45:30,860 --> 00:45:33,020
 And they're fossils of chlorophyll.

1274
00:45:33,020 --> 00:45:35,940
 But back in the day, really back in the day then,

1275
00:45:35,940 --> 00:45:39,020
 chlorophyll is now green, that's what makes plants green.

1276
00:45:39,020 --> 00:45:40,860
 But back then, it was pink.

1277
00:45:40,860 --> 00:45:43,020
 And it was this pink produced by ancient bacteria.

1278
00:45:43,020 --> 00:45:44,540
 And that was all there was.

1279
00:45:44,540 --> 00:45:46,620
 And that was what the oceans were full of.

1280
00:45:46,620 --> 00:45:48,780
 And so the whole world was pink.

1281
00:45:48,780 --> 00:45:51,900
 Barbie's world was 1.1 billion years ago.

1282
00:45:51,900 --> 00:45:55,100
 You knew she was old-fashioned, but...

1283
00:45:55,100 --> 00:45:57,220
 Have you guys heard of yum, yum, yellow?

1284
00:45:57,220 --> 00:45:58,420
 Yum, yum, yum, yellow.

1285
00:45:58,420 --> 00:45:59,660
 Yum, yum, yellow.

1286
00:45:59,660 --> 00:46:03,900
 No. Is it the yellow of that mustard yellow

1287
00:46:03,900 --> 00:46:06,780
 that is meant to make us think it's delicious, whatever it is?

1288
00:46:06,780 --> 00:46:08,620
 Um, no.

1289
00:46:08,620 --> 00:46:10,300
 Is it sea-based? Is it sponge-bog?

1290
00:46:10,300 --> 00:46:12,380
 It's sea-based. Is it a starfish?

1291
00:46:12,380 --> 00:46:14,780
 It's not. What have I already said about yellow?

1292
00:46:14,780 --> 00:46:16,380
 The yellow and blue fish on the reefs?

1293
00:46:16,380 --> 00:46:20,140
 Yes. So yellow is very easy to see under water.

1294
00:46:20,140 --> 00:46:23,100
 And there is a theory that if you're wearing yum, yum, yellow

1295
00:46:23,100 --> 00:46:24,300
 when you're scuba diving,

1296
00:46:24,300 --> 00:46:26,820
 you're more likely to get eaten by sharks.

1297
00:46:26,820 --> 00:46:27,820
 Oh!

1298
00:46:27,820 --> 00:46:30,060
 And scuba divers will talk about this,

1299
00:46:30,060 --> 00:46:32,940
 and they'll say you should never wear yum, yum, yellow.

1300
00:46:32,940 --> 00:46:34,860
 It comes from early...

1301
00:46:34,860 --> 00:46:38,620
 In the World War II, there was a lot of incidents in the Pacific

1302
00:46:38,620 --> 00:46:41,500
 where US Navy people would end up in the water

1303
00:46:41,500 --> 00:46:43,740
 and they'd get eaten by sharks and stuff like that.

1304
00:46:43,740 --> 00:46:45,580
 It comes from that originally.

1305
00:46:45,580 --> 00:46:47,580
 And we're not really sure whether it...

1306
00:46:47,580 --> 00:46:50,540
 Not it's true that sharks do go for yellow.

1307
00:46:50,540 --> 00:46:52,460
 Are we saying people aren't willing to test this?

1308
00:46:52,460 --> 00:46:56,140
 Well, it seems theoretical that it's true.

1309
00:46:56,140 --> 00:46:58,300
 But the international shark attack file said,

1310
00:46:58,300 --> 00:47:01,420
 "The benefit of increasing one's chances of being rescued

1311
00:47:01,420 --> 00:47:04,620
 far outweighs the minimal risk of attracting a shark."

1312
00:47:04,620 --> 00:47:07,180
 So the thing is, if you're yellow, people will be able to see you

1313
00:47:07,180 --> 00:47:08,300
 and be able to rescue you.

1314
00:47:08,300 --> 00:47:11,900
 There was a person called Valerie Taylor who invented a wetsuit

1315
00:47:11,900 --> 00:47:15,740
 which had the same markings as sea snakes,

1316
00:47:15,740 --> 00:47:18,700
 because grey-white sharks don't like sea snakes.

1317
00:47:18,700 --> 00:47:20,620
 And the theory was that they would see you

1318
00:47:20,620 --> 00:47:23,020
 and think you were a snake and then would swim away.

1319
00:47:23,020 --> 00:47:24,700
 And it's a really good theory.

1320
00:47:24,700 --> 00:47:26,220
 -The only problem... -She got eaten.

1321
00:47:26,220 --> 00:47:29,420
 Well, tiger sharks are keen predators of sea snakes.

1322
00:47:29,420 --> 00:47:30,860
 Oh, no!

1323
00:47:30,860 --> 00:47:33,100
 So it does save you from the great wikes,

1324
00:47:33,100 --> 00:47:35,180
 but the tigers will still get you.

1325
00:47:35,180 --> 00:47:37,660
 Do you know, that's a new thing, sea snakes.

1326
00:47:37,660 --> 00:47:41,100
 In 2021, a report was done by a scuba diver

1327
00:47:41,100 --> 00:47:43,580
 who noticed that every time he was going into the water,

1328
00:47:43,580 --> 00:47:45,820
 sea snakes were trying to shag him.

1329
00:47:45,820 --> 00:47:48,220
 And it was because they can't really see.

1330
00:47:48,220 --> 00:47:49,820
 The only way they can know properly

1331
00:47:49,820 --> 00:47:52,300
 what they are going to be eating is by tasting it.

1332
00:47:52,300 --> 00:47:54,380
 So they wrap themselves around the legs

1333
00:47:54,380 --> 00:47:56,700
 and the torsos of scuba divers,

1334
00:47:56,700 --> 00:47:58,700
 and they start licking them and then going,

1335
00:47:58,700 --> 00:48:01,260
 "Oh, no, this is not a sea snake."

1336
00:48:01,260 --> 00:48:02,220
 But this...

1337
00:48:02,220 --> 00:48:03,340
 Wait, do they want to...

1338
00:48:03,340 --> 00:48:05,500
 Are they testing if they want to eat it or shag it, sorry?

1339
00:48:05,500 --> 00:48:08,220
 So it's mating season, and because they can't see,

1340
00:48:08,220 --> 00:48:10,300
 basically in order to know what they're dealing with,

1341
00:48:10,300 --> 00:48:11,500
 they need to lick it.

1342
00:48:11,500 --> 00:48:13,420
 And that's not good.

1343
00:48:13,420 --> 00:48:16,620
 The other thing with sea snakes is the way of cutting

1344
00:48:16,620 --> 00:48:19,260
 is the male will go up and look for a female,

1345
00:48:19,260 --> 00:48:21,660
 and then the female will swim away.

1346
00:48:21,660 --> 00:48:24,380
 And so if you're a diver and the load of sea snakes

1347
00:48:24,380 --> 00:48:27,020
 come up to you and you swim off away from them,

1348
00:48:27,020 --> 00:48:28,940
 they think you're playing hard to get.

1349
00:48:28,940 --> 00:48:30,220
 Yeah.

1350
00:48:30,220 --> 00:48:32,540
 So apparently the best thing to do is just go to the bottom

1351
00:48:32,540 --> 00:48:35,100
 of the reef and just let them...

1352
00:48:35,100 --> 00:48:35,980
 Let them go?

1353
00:48:35,980 --> 00:48:37,020
 Let them have a go.

1354
00:48:37,020 --> 00:48:37,660
 All right.

1355
00:48:37,660 --> 00:48:39,020
 And soon they'll realize

1356
00:48:39,020 --> 00:48:40,860
 that you're not a sea snake and bugger off.

1357
00:48:40,860 --> 00:48:42,140
 Yeah. Wow.

1358
00:48:42,140 --> 00:48:45,580
 There was a study recently of a body of water,

1359
00:48:45,580 --> 00:48:47,100
 a body of water that one of us loves more

1360
00:48:47,100 --> 00:48:49,020
 than any other in the world.

1361
00:48:49,020 --> 00:48:51,100
 Oh, gosh, I don't have a favourite

1362
00:48:51,100 --> 00:48:52,380
 body of water, I don't think.

1363
00:48:52,380 --> 00:48:54,220
 Dan, you've been there looking for a...

1364
00:48:54,220 --> 00:48:55,180
 Oh, Loch Ness.

1365
00:48:55,180 --> 00:48:57,420
 Oh, Loch Ness, right.

1366
00:48:57,420 --> 00:49:00,380
 There was a theory that maybe, just maybe,

1367
00:49:00,380 --> 00:49:05,020
 a very, very big eel might be the Loch Ness monster,

1368
00:49:05,020 --> 00:49:07,100
 like a six metre long eel.

1369
00:49:07,100 --> 00:49:08,780
 Carl Sagan, great scientist,

1370
00:49:08,780 --> 00:49:11,100
 admittedly more of space than of water,

1371
00:49:11,100 --> 00:49:13,980
 thought that there could be 310 metre eels living there.

1372
00:49:13,980 --> 00:49:14,940
 And if they all teamed up,

1373
00:49:14,940 --> 00:49:18,460
 they could look very convincingly like the Loch Ness monster.

1374
00:49:19,180 --> 00:49:21,820
 And there was a study, a sort of troll of the DNA in the water,

1375
00:49:21,820 --> 00:49:24,220
 and they found huge amounts of eel DNA.

1376
00:49:24,220 --> 00:49:25,340
 And so, right, we're on a winner.

1377
00:49:25,340 --> 00:49:27,420
 Like, maybe the Loch Ness monster

1378
00:49:27,420 --> 00:49:30,140
 is actually just a load of eels.

1379
00:49:30,140 --> 00:49:32,220
 But unfortunately, the latest thinking

1380
00:49:32,220 --> 00:49:34,860
 is that probably there are not giant eels living there.

1381
00:49:34,860 --> 00:49:37,100
 Because the maximum length of a European eel,

1382
00:49:37,100 --> 00:49:38,300
 as I don't need to remind you guys,

1383
00:49:38,300 --> 00:49:39,820
 is about 0.9 metres long.

1384
00:49:39,820 --> 00:49:43,820
 The odds of finding a six metre eel are very slim.

1385
00:49:43,820 --> 00:49:46,220
 But that just means six ties more of them

1386
00:49:46,220 --> 00:49:48,860
 need to get together to pretend to be a Loch Ness monster, right?

1387
00:49:48,860 --> 00:49:51,420
 Yeah, they just need to buy a bigger trenchcoat.

1388
00:49:51,420 --> 00:49:55,740
 Yeah, well, so maybe, maybe that's it.

1389
00:49:55,740 --> 00:49:58,300
 Quite a cool thing related to Dan's original fact

1390
00:49:58,300 --> 00:50:01,660
 about wavelengths travelling different amounts underwater.

1391
00:50:01,660 --> 00:50:03,180
 You know when it's been a hot sunny day,

1392
00:50:03,180 --> 00:50:04,540
 and you think, oh, I'll get in the river

1393
00:50:04,540 --> 00:50:05,820
 because it's a nice hot sunny day,

1394
00:50:05,820 --> 00:50:07,180
 and you put your toe in and it's like,

1395
00:50:07,180 --> 00:50:09,020
 oh, the water's so warm and nice.

1396
00:50:09,020 --> 00:50:10,540
 And then you put your full foot in,

1397
00:50:10,540 --> 00:50:13,500
 it's fucking freezing underneath that.

1398
00:50:13,500 --> 00:50:16,300
 That is because in the electromagnetic spectrum,

1399
00:50:16,300 --> 00:50:17,500
 which you'll remember from school,

1400
00:50:17,500 --> 00:50:21,500
 infrared waves have an even longer wavelength than red,

1401
00:50:21,500 --> 00:50:23,500
 and they're the ones that we get heat from.

1402
00:50:23,500 --> 00:50:25,340
 And so when they come from the sun,

1403
00:50:25,340 --> 00:50:27,020
 the heat lands in the water

1404
00:50:27,020 --> 00:50:28,940
 and immediately spreads on the surface

1405
00:50:28,940 --> 00:50:31,180
 and it only gets 10 centimetres down max.

1406
00:50:31,180 --> 00:50:32,380
 So that's why, I mean, obviously,

1407
00:50:32,380 --> 00:50:34,220
 then it does mix in a bit because it's liquid,

1408
00:50:34,220 --> 00:50:36,460
 but that is why when you put your foot in the water

1409
00:50:36,460 --> 00:50:37,900
 and you think, lovely.

1410
00:50:37,900 --> 00:50:38,460
 Yeah.

1411
00:50:38,460 --> 00:50:39,660
 Yeah, then...

1412
00:50:39,660 --> 00:50:42,060
 Interestingly, that's the same with trees, right?

1413
00:50:42,060 --> 00:50:42,860
 So if you...

1414
00:50:42,860 --> 00:50:43,420
 Oh, here we go.

1415
00:50:43,420 --> 00:50:45,020
 God, it all comes back to that, please.

1416
00:50:45,020 --> 00:50:45,740
 No, no, it's true.

1417
00:50:45,740 --> 00:50:49,660
 If you hug, wrap your arms around the lower trunk of daddy

1418
00:50:49,660 --> 00:50:51,820
 and you're going to have a colder experience.

1419
00:50:51,820 --> 00:50:53,980
 So they found this out with koalas, basically.

1420
00:50:53,980 --> 00:50:55,020
 It's a very similar thing,

1421
00:50:55,020 --> 00:50:57,740
 which is that koalas, when it gets really hot,

1422
00:50:57,740 --> 00:51:00,940
 they travel down a tree and they hug a tree much lower

1423
00:51:00,940 --> 00:51:04,460
 and they did scans on the tree to see the heat signals.

1424
00:51:04,460 --> 00:51:06,860
 On a lower bit of a tree, it's always colder.

1425
00:51:06,860 --> 00:51:08,540
 So they're regulating themselves

1426
00:51:08,540 --> 00:51:10,220
 because they don't sweat koalas.

1427
00:51:10,220 --> 00:51:13,500
 They have to sort of lick out the wetness out of them.

1428
00:51:15,100 --> 00:51:17,660
 They lick themselves and they're not evaporated

1429
00:51:17,660 --> 00:51:18,700
 and takes away the heat.

1430
00:51:18,700 --> 00:51:21,020
 I mean, that's a different way of saying it.

1431
00:51:21,020 --> 00:51:25,260
 They don't have to suck their own sweat out.

1432
00:51:25,260 --> 00:51:29,180
 But this thing actually about the koalas is interesting

1433
00:51:29,180 --> 00:51:31,020
 because that study was done a few years ago, right?

1434
00:51:31,020 --> 00:51:32,940
 And they wondered if anyone else did it

1435
00:51:32,940 --> 00:51:34,780
 and they found that there's a type of lima

1436
00:51:34,780 --> 00:51:36,300
 called the white sifaka.

1437
00:51:36,300 --> 00:51:40,220
 And they do the same thing in Madagascar.

1438
00:51:40,220 --> 00:51:41,980
 And the amazing thing about that,

1439
00:51:41,980 --> 00:51:44,700
 they hug the trees because they want to get cool.

1440
00:51:45,020 --> 00:51:46,620
 Because the water comes up from below,

1441
00:51:46,620 --> 00:51:48,460
 it's a little bit cooler, it can keep them cool.

1442
00:51:48,460 --> 00:51:51,820
 And what they found out is that they never do it

1443
00:51:51,820 --> 00:51:54,220
 until the temperature gets to 30 degrees.

1444
00:51:54,220 --> 00:51:56,780
 And then for each one degree increase,

1445
00:51:56,780 --> 00:51:59,580
 it doubles the chances of the limas going there.

1446
00:51:59,580 --> 00:52:01,500
 So it means that if you're in Madagascar

1447
00:52:01,500 --> 00:52:03,340
 and you don't have a thermometer with you,

1448
00:52:03,340 --> 00:52:06,220
 all you have to do is count the number of limas

1449
00:52:06,220 --> 00:52:07,740
 who are around the trunk.

1450
00:52:07,740 --> 00:52:09,180
 And that'll tell you what the temperature is.

1451
00:52:09,180 --> 00:52:09,900
 That's incredible.

1452
00:52:09,900 --> 00:52:11,740
 That's amazing.

1453
00:52:11,740 --> 00:52:12,940
 Guys, we're going to have to wrap up.

1454
00:52:12,940 --> 00:52:14,060
 That's so good.

1455
00:52:14,060 --> 00:52:16,140
 And do you know what kind of TV dolphins like?

1456
00:52:16,140 --> 00:52:19,420
 Well, we're talking about seeing things underwater.

1457
00:52:19,420 --> 00:52:20,860
 It won't be flipper-eyed.

1458
00:52:20,860 --> 00:52:22,860
 It won't be stuff that they're in.

1459
00:52:22,860 --> 00:52:26,620
 Well, I don't really like to watch things that I'm in.

1460
00:52:26,620 --> 00:52:30,060
 What do dolphins like?

1461
00:52:30,060 --> 00:52:32,140
 They love fish to eat fish.

1462
00:52:32,140 --> 00:52:33,340
 Reality stuff.

1463
00:52:33,340 --> 00:52:34,700
 Reality shows.

1464
00:52:34,700 --> 00:52:34,940
 Yeah.

1465
00:52:34,940 --> 00:52:38,700
 Well, some scientists showed some bottle noses,

1466
00:52:38,700 --> 00:52:41,180
 Planet Earth and SpongeBob SquarePants.

1467
00:52:41,740 --> 00:52:46,300
 And tried to see whether they prefer real life underwater scenes

1468
00:52:46,300 --> 00:52:49,100
 or ones where they stupidly get the traffic lights wrong.

1469
00:52:49,100 --> 00:52:53,180
 And it turns out that actually dolphins are interested

1470
00:52:53,180 --> 00:52:55,260
 in all TV shows no matter what is on.

1471
00:52:55,260 --> 00:52:57,420
 I knew they were stupid.

1472
00:52:57,420 --> 00:53:01,020
 Although male dolphins slightly preferred

1473
00:53:01,020 --> 00:53:03,180
 to watch videos of female dolphins.

1474
00:53:03,180 --> 00:53:05,500
 OK.

1475
00:53:05,500 --> 00:53:09,580
 Just like your average British man at the end of any day, really.

1476
00:53:09,580 --> 00:53:10,860
 I'll watch anything.

1477
00:53:10,860 --> 00:53:13,420
 Mildly prefer it if there's a female in it.

1478
00:53:13,420 --> 00:53:13,900
 Good on him.

1479
00:53:13,900 --> 00:53:17,260
 Lovely thought to end on.

1480
00:53:17,260 --> 00:53:19,660
 I've got that right.

1481
00:53:19,660 --> 00:53:20,300
 That makes you think.

1482
00:53:20,300 --> 00:53:24,380
 Meanwhile, Dan's watching Forestry Live 24 hours a day.

1483
00:53:24,380 --> 00:53:32,140
 OK, everyone.

1484
00:53:32,140 --> 00:53:32,940
 That is it.

1485
00:53:32,940 --> 00:53:33,820
 That is our facts.
