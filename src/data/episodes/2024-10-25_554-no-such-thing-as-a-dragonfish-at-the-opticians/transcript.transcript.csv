00:00:00,00:00:02,(upbeat music)
00:00:02,00:00:14,- Hello and welcome to another episode
00:00:14,00:00:16,"of No Such Thing as a Fish,"
00:00:16,00:00:20,a weekly podcast this week coming to you live from Cardiff.
00:00:20,00:00:23,(audience cheering)
00:00:23,00:00:25,My name is Dan Schreiber.
00:00:25,00:00:28,"I am sitting here with Anna Tyshinski, Andrew Hunter Murray"
00:00:28,00:00:29,and James Harkin.
00:00:29,00:00:32,"And once again, we have gathered round the microphones"
00:00:32,00:00:35,with our four favorite facts from the last seven days
00:00:35,00:00:38,"and in no particular order, here we go."
00:00:38,00:00:41,"Starting with fact number one, that is Andy."
00:00:41,00:00:44,- My fact is that the Glasgow Tree Hugging Competition
00:00:44,00:00:46,contains three rounds.
00:00:46,00:00:51,"Speed Hugging, Dedicated Hugging and Freestyle Hugging."
00:00:51,00:00:53,(audience laughing)
00:00:53,00:00:55,- Wow. - Yeah.
00:00:55,00:00:57,- Freestyle. - Freestyle.
00:00:57,00:00:58,- What is freestyle?
00:00:58,00:00:59,"It still has to be a tree, does it?"
00:00:59,00:01:00,"- It all has to be a tree,"
00:01:00,00:01:03,but freestyle is by a long way the most erotic.
00:01:03,00:01:04,(audience laughing)
00:01:04,00:01:06,"- Well, I think we're witnessing freestyle"
00:01:06,00:01:07,in the background here.
00:01:07,00:01:09,There's an image that we put up on the screens
00:01:09,00:01:09,at our live show.
00:01:09,00:01:11,"The person up there is Hannah Willow,"
00:01:11,00:01:13,who is the winner of this year's--
00:01:13,00:01:14,- Hannah Willow? - Yeah.
00:01:14,00:01:16,- Did she marry the tree that she hugged?
00:01:16,00:01:17,(audience laughing)
00:01:17,00:01:18,It looks like it.
00:01:18,00:01:20,"- They should be married, considering--"
00:01:20,00:01:21,"- Oh, really? - Considering the--"
00:01:21,00:01:23,"- I was gonna say, Andy, for some of us,"
00:01:23,00:01:25,an erotic hug is also the speed hug.
00:01:25,00:01:28,(audience laughing)
00:01:28,00:01:32,You have to hug as many trees as possible in one minute.
00:01:32,00:01:33,So that is both speedy.
00:01:33,00:01:35,- Do you know the number?
00:01:35,00:01:37,"- I actually don't know what Hannah scored on that,"
00:01:37,00:01:38,"but the hugs have to last five seconds each,"
00:01:38,00:01:40,so it's just--
00:01:40,00:01:41,- Do you know what the world record
00:01:41,00:01:44,for most trees hugged in an hour is?
00:01:44,00:01:45,- No. - Ooh.
00:01:45,00:01:47,- Can you have a guess?
00:01:47,00:01:48,- What country?
00:01:48,00:01:49,"- Ghana, what? - How will--"
00:01:49,00:01:50,"Sorry, then."
00:01:50,00:01:51,(audience laughing)
00:01:51,00:01:52,And how are you factoring that
00:01:52,00:01:55,into your matrix of calculations?
00:01:55,00:01:58,"- So Ghana, dense forest, trees are close to each other."
00:01:58,00:02:00,"- Point, but equatorial, saps the energy."
00:02:00,00:02:01,(audience laughing)
00:02:01,00:02:02,- Damn.
00:02:02,00:02:04,"- I think in Ghana, you probably know this, Dan,"
00:02:04,00:02:07,"but they've done a lot of tree planting in recent years,"
00:02:07,00:02:09,so they got quite a lot of smaller trees.
00:02:09,00:02:10,- Oh.
00:02:10,00:02:11,- But that's good.
00:02:11,00:02:12,That means you can get between them faster.
00:02:12,00:02:12,- Exactly.
00:02:12,00:02:14,I think that's what Dan's asking.
00:02:14,00:02:14,- Yeah.
00:02:14,00:02:15,- Okay.
00:02:15,00:02:16,"How many seconds are there in an hour, James?"
00:02:16,00:02:18,"- There are about 3,600."
00:02:18,00:02:22,"- I'll say 3,600, one per second."
00:02:22,00:02:23,- One per second.
00:02:23,00:02:25,"You have to, someone's not bringing the tree to you,"
00:02:25,00:02:26,so you can hug it.
00:02:26,00:02:28,You have to go from one tree to another.
00:02:28,00:02:29,- Are you allowed to hug the same?
00:02:29,00:02:31,Can you just go from one tree and back again and again
00:02:31,00:02:33,"and again, or does that have to be a different tree each time?"
00:02:33,00:02:33,- Every tree different.
00:02:33,00:02:34,- Every tree different.
00:02:34,00:02:35,- What if you run up a tree?
00:02:35,00:02:36,"What if you hug so many,"
00:02:36,00:02:37,and no more trees left in Ghana?
00:02:37,00:02:38,(laughing)
00:02:38,00:02:40,- The number is lower than the total number
00:02:40,00:02:41,of trees in Ghana.
00:02:41,00:02:41,(audience laughing)
00:02:41,00:02:42,"- Okay, but the other way--"
00:02:42,00:02:44,- Does the five second rule apply to each hug?
00:02:44,00:02:45,"- No, it doesn't."
00:02:45,00:02:46,- What's that?
00:02:46,00:02:47,If you can still eat it
00:02:47,00:02:50,as long as you have to drop the tree for five seconds?
00:02:50,00:02:52,"- The tree falls over in the forest, but no one notices,"
00:02:52,00:02:54,and you quickly put it on your plate and it's fine.
00:02:54,00:02:55,- Yeah.
00:02:55,00:02:56,"No, in this tree hugging,"
00:02:56,00:02:58,you need to hug for five seconds per tree.
00:02:58,00:02:59,"- No, this one is--"
00:02:59,00:03:01,"- Okay, so I'm gonna say 400."
00:03:01,00:03:02,- 100?
00:03:02,00:03:03,Any advance?
00:03:03,00:03:05,"- I think about a grand, about a thousand."
00:03:05,00:03:06,- About a thousand.
00:03:06,00:03:08,Anna is correct.
00:03:08,00:03:09,- What?
00:03:09,00:03:11,"- Almost, it's 1,123,"
00:03:11,00:03:14,which is on average one every 3.2 seconds.
00:03:14,00:03:15,"- Wow, decent."
00:03:15,00:03:16,- That's really good.
00:03:16,00:03:17,- That's pretty good.
00:03:17,00:03:20,Abu Bakar Tahiru did it this year.
00:03:20,00:03:21,- Nice.
00:03:21,00:03:24,"- But Hannah Willow, previously mentioned,"
00:03:24,00:03:25,I think where she excelled
00:03:25,00:03:27,"in these three elements you mentioned, Andy,"
00:03:27,00:03:29,is the dedication.
00:03:29,00:03:33,"And that is where you show devotion, passion, and loyalty."
00:03:33,00:03:36,"So, that's where she won the competition."
00:03:36,00:03:38,"- And that's a single tree, isn't it?"
00:03:38,00:03:39,"- Yes, that's a single tree."
00:03:39,00:03:41,"- And it's interesting, I think freestyle,"
00:03:41,00:03:42,that round is also a single tree.
00:03:42,00:03:45,So you have to show something other than an embrace.
00:03:45,00:03:46,So it's not actually a hug at all.
00:03:46,00:03:50,"It's, you might play it a song, you might..."
00:03:50,00:03:51,"- Oh, great."
00:03:51,00:03:53,"- She did a dance, that was her big thing."
00:03:53,00:03:56,"Yeah, she didn't know that that was required of her."
00:03:56,00:03:58,So she just had to improvise a dance.
00:03:58,00:04:00,But she is someone who goes out and does forest bathing.
00:04:00,00:04:03,She spends a lot of time getting in touch with nature.
00:04:03,00:04:05,- Can we talk about what forest bathing is?
00:04:05,00:04:06,'Cause I read that as well and I liked that.
00:04:06,00:04:07,"- Yeah, what is that?"
00:04:07,00:04:10,"- Well, it's when you go out to the forest"
00:04:10,00:04:12,"and you just bathe, right?"
00:04:12,00:04:16,"You're like, you just take in the smells"
00:04:16,00:04:17,"and the air and the, it's just going out."
00:04:17,00:04:18,It's like a nice wall.
00:04:18,00:04:21,- So what I assumed is correct that it is another way
00:04:21,00:04:24,of saying she likes to go for a walk in the woods.
00:04:24,00:04:28,"- Yeah, does she have to take her clothes off like a bath?"
00:04:28,00:04:28,- No.
00:04:28,00:04:29,- Okay.
00:04:29,00:04:30,- You don't have to take your clothes off in the bath.
00:04:30,00:04:31,"Fun fact, I don't."
00:04:31,00:04:34,(laughing)
00:04:34,00:04:36,- You never take your socks off in any situation.
00:04:36,00:04:37,- Absolutely not.
00:04:37,00:04:39,- Even the erotic freestyle.
00:04:39,00:04:42,- It makes it more erotic if the socks are still on.
00:04:42,00:04:43,- But it's really cool.
00:04:43,00:04:45,"She's, so she's a mum of three"
00:04:45,00:04:47,"and she was asked like,"
00:04:47,00:04:49,are they excited that mum is the tree hugging champion?
00:04:49,00:04:51,"And they said, no, they were hugely embarrassed"
00:04:51,00:04:54,to find out I was tree hugging champion.
00:04:54,00:04:56,"Yeah, I've slightly ruined their street cred"
00:04:56,00:04:57,is what she said.
00:04:57,00:04:59,But she's going to ruin it even more
00:04:59,00:05:01,because it's not just about winning the Glaswegian
00:05:01,00:05:03,tree hugging competition.
00:05:03,00:05:07,"She now, by winning that qualifies to represent Glasgow"
00:05:07,00:05:09,in the international tree hugging competition
00:05:09,00:05:11,that happens in Finland.
00:05:11,00:05:13,It's like a giant global competition
00:05:13,00:05:15,where all our best huggers go and meet in Finland
00:05:15,00:05:16,for an ultimate hug.
00:05:16,00:05:19,"- That's gonna be tough for the favourites from Ghana,"
00:05:19,00:05:20,isn't it?
00:05:20,00:05:21,Going all the way up to Finland and that cold weather.
00:05:21,00:05:22,- Yes.
00:05:22,00:05:23,- It's gonna be really tough.
00:05:23,00:05:24,- It is advantage.
00:05:24,00:05:26,"- And the taller trees, they won't know what to do, right?"
00:05:26,00:05:27,- Yeah.
00:05:27,00:05:31,"I assume you only took the bottom of the trees, right?"
00:05:31,00:05:33,"- Yeah, there's no rule about whether you have to hug"
00:05:33,00:05:34,base or tip.
00:05:34,00:05:34,It's just not.
00:05:34,00:05:37,- Go on.
00:05:37,00:05:39,- Guard it.
00:05:39,00:05:41,"But no, it is, it's a really, it's quite fun."
00:05:41,00:05:43,"I mean, I was quite skeptical about it."
00:05:43,00:05:45,"I think it was a bit silly, but the Finnish one,"
00:05:45,00:05:47,"which is in a place called Halibu, I think,"
00:05:47,00:05:50,it was designed this competition by the family
00:05:50,00:05:53,of a lumberjack who realised he'd been growing
00:05:53,00:05:57,all these trees and he loved them too much to cut them down.
00:05:57,00:05:59,And he was like a shepherd who just can't bear
00:05:59,00:06:00,going to the abattoir.
00:06:00,00:06:03,So he and his family thought of this programme
00:06:03,00:06:05,where people adopt trees and they've been trying--
00:06:05,00:06:07,- Is that not just a lazy lumberjack?
00:06:07,00:06:08,- Well.
00:06:08,00:06:10,"- Who says, oh yeah, sorry, I didn't chop any down today"
00:06:10,00:06:12,because I love them too much.
00:06:12,00:06:14,"- You're right, letting someone hug your trees"
00:06:14,00:06:17,"is a much skin off your nose, is it?"
00:06:17,00:06:19,- But this has become a big thing since COVID.
00:06:19,00:06:22,"And I remember when we were playing on a previous tour,"
00:06:22,00:06:24,we were playing Richmond in London
00:06:24,00:06:26,and I went to Kew Gardens beforehand
00:06:26,00:06:30,and I saw a lady go up and give a massive hug to a tree.
00:06:30,00:06:32,And it looks so nice.
00:06:32,00:06:34,"It looks so, 'cause like we'd all been stuck"
00:06:34,00:06:37,and she was allowed to connect back with nature again.
00:06:37,00:06:38,"And I just, it was a bit pervy."
00:06:38,00:06:40,I just watched them hug for ages.
00:06:40,00:06:43,- What were you doing while you were watching?
00:06:43,00:06:45,"'Cause if it was just watching, I think it's fine."
00:06:45,00:06:46,"- I think the rule is if you're in a bush,"
00:06:46,00:06:47,it's not all right.
00:06:47,00:06:49,"If you're just in the open, it's fine."
00:06:49,00:06:50,- Unless you're hugging the bush.
00:06:50,00:06:51,- You might be bush bathing.
00:06:51,00:06:52,"That's the thing, though, yeah."
00:06:52,00:06:54,"- Yeah, I was just watching."
00:06:54,00:06:56,"I didn't, yeah, I just watched."
00:06:56,00:06:58,- There is evidence that if you--
00:06:58,00:07:00,- I just watched.
00:07:00,00:07:03,"Don't keep saying it, but I only watched, guys."
00:07:03,00:07:06,- There is evidence that you can lower your blood pressure
00:07:06,00:07:07,by touching wood.
00:07:07,00:07:08,(audience laughs)
00:07:08,00:07:10,"- Andy said, ""Grow up, guys, come on."""
00:07:10,00:07:14,"Different types of wood, depending on the texture"
00:07:14,00:07:16,"of the wood, it can have a different effect."
00:07:16,00:07:18,- So not the splintery ones?
00:07:18,00:07:20,- Not the splintery ones.
00:07:20,00:07:22,"- Is that in the form of a tree, or is it just any wood?"
00:07:22,00:07:23,- It actually works with any wood.
00:07:23,00:07:24,- Really?
00:07:24,00:07:26,"- Yeah, yeah, they did it where they compared people"
00:07:26,00:07:29,"putting their hand on plastic, on metal,"
00:07:29,00:07:31,and then on wood and their blood pressure went down.
00:07:31,00:07:32,- Really?
00:07:32,00:07:35,"- Oh, well, I hugged a tree in preparation for this fact."
00:07:35,00:07:36,- Did you?
00:07:36,00:07:38,"- Your research is always below par down,"
00:07:38,00:07:39,but this is reaching new depths.
00:07:39,00:07:41,"- No, but it is really nice."
00:07:41,00:07:43,"I've got to say, it was a genuinely nice experience,"
00:07:43,00:07:45,and a lot of people have been getting back in contact
00:07:45,00:07:46,with nature in that kind of way.
00:07:46,00:07:48,"Again, since the pandemic,"
00:07:48,00:07:49,"and there's been reports all over the world,"
00:07:49,00:07:51,"so in New Zealand, there's great trees"
00:07:51,00:07:54,"that the curators keep busting people, hugging."
00:07:54,00:07:56,"He's like, ""I kind of get it, though."
00:07:56,00:07:58,"""This tree has ribbons of flaky brown bark,"
00:07:58,00:08:00,"""almost begs to be peeled like a banana."""
00:08:00,00:08:04,"And he talks about great trees to hug,"
00:08:04,00:08:08,"like the long leaf pine, the spongy bark that it has."
00:08:08,00:08:10,"It practically hugs back, you know?"
00:08:10,00:08:11,- Oh.
00:08:11,00:08:15,"- I can see, I can see, but I did only watch."
00:08:15,00:08:16,(audience laughs)
00:08:16,00:08:18,- And what kind of tree did you hug?
00:08:18,00:08:20,- It's a tree that's in my garden.
00:08:20,00:08:21,- But did you even find out its name?
00:08:21,00:08:24,(audience laughs)
00:08:24,00:08:25,"- Okay, this is a bit embarrassing,"
00:08:25,00:08:26,'cause there's five trees.
00:08:26,00:08:28,"We named them after each member of our family,"
00:08:28,00:08:30,"so I hugged, I hugged Daddy."
00:08:30,00:08:33,(audience laughs)
00:08:34,00:08:36,(audience laughs)
00:08:36,00:08:39,"- I don't wanna rain on this tree-hugging parade,"
00:08:39,00:08:42,"but something smells bad about it,"
00:08:42,00:08:45,"and it's this, that, so it's organized,"
00:08:45,00:08:48,the Glasgow Tree Hugging Competition by Vicky Dale.
00:08:48,00:08:51,"The children's prize was won by Lottie,"
00:08:51,00:08:53,who is Dale's daughter.
00:08:53,00:08:55,And-- - What?
00:08:55,00:08:57,- The children's speed-hugging race
00:08:57,00:08:59,"won by Freddie, Dale's son."
00:08:59,00:09:00,"- Oh, dear."
00:09:00,00:09:01,"- What's going on there, guys?"
00:09:01,00:09:04,"There were only 15 entrants in this whole contest,"
00:09:04,00:09:06,"by the way, which, the Guardian write-up"
00:09:06,00:09:08,"of Hannah Willow-winning was saying,"
00:09:08,00:09:11,"""Willow has savored the rush of victory before,"
00:09:11,00:09:12,"""but only on a minor scale."""
00:09:12,00:09:13,(audience laughs)
00:09:13,00:09:16,How major is this 15-entern competition?
00:09:16,00:09:18,"- She's super cool, though, by the way."
00:09:18,00:09:20,"If you, I've gone onto her Instagram,"
00:09:20,00:09:21,'cause I was trying to get in contact with her
00:09:21,00:09:23,to ask her questions for this.
00:09:23,00:09:26,- Would you be willing for me to watch out of the open?
00:09:26,00:09:28,(audience laughs)
00:09:28,00:09:29,- You're sincerely a daddy.
00:09:29,00:09:32,(audience laughs)
00:09:32,00:09:36,"- Well, while we're on that subject,"
00:09:36,00:09:38,"there is a thing called, what is it, dendrophilia,"
00:09:38,00:09:41,which is basically the sexualization of trees.
00:09:41,00:09:43,"I mean, that is a real thing."
00:09:43,00:09:47,"- I saw a news article of a man in Wiltshire in 2023,"
00:09:47,00:09:51,"who was arrested after apparently having sex with a tree,"
00:09:51,00:09:52,so said the headline.
00:09:52,00:09:55,"One witness said, ""I was just walking in the park"
00:09:55,00:09:57,"""with one of my mates, and we saw a man hugging a tree,"
00:09:57,00:09:59,"""and thought it was interesting."
00:09:59,00:10:00,"""We walked closer, and as we did,"
00:10:00,00:10:05,"""we saw his trousers down, and thought, 'This is pure gold.'"""
00:10:05,00:10:08,(audience laughs)
00:10:08,00:10:10,"- After I stopped recording,"
00:10:10,00:10:13,(audience laughs)
00:10:13,00:10:15,the police turned up and arrested him.
00:10:15,00:10:18,"- Wow, good grief."
00:10:18,00:10:20,Celebrity tree huggers?
00:10:20,00:10:21,"- Oh, yeah. - Oh, yeah."
00:10:21,00:10:24,"- So Prince Charles, as we know."
00:10:24,00:10:25,"- Yeah, he talks to them."
00:10:25,00:10:27,"- He, yeah, King Charles, I know."
00:10:27,00:10:30,He claims he shakes hands with every tree he's planted
00:10:30,00:10:31,and wishes them well.
00:10:31,00:10:32,- What is a tree is--
00:10:32,00:10:34,"- Well, a leaf, a branch."
00:10:34,00:10:36,"- I would say a leaf is a finger, yeah, a branch is an arm."
00:10:36,00:10:37,"- No, he tends to do leaves,"
00:10:37,00:10:39,"so it's usually a tree planting ceremony,"
00:10:39,00:10:42,"and he'll shake a leaf and say, ""Oh, have a good time."""
00:10:42,00:10:43,"And walk off, it's sort of--"
00:10:43,00:10:45,- But you have to shake so many leaves.
00:10:45,00:10:47,You don't want to do it like a full hug for everyone.
00:10:47,00:10:49,"- Yeah, sure. - Yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:10:49,00:10:50,Novak Djokovic?
00:10:50,00:10:52,"- Yeah. - Again, not that surprising."
00:10:52,00:10:54,- Tree hugger? - Yeah.
00:10:54,00:10:55,"- When he does the Australian Open,"
00:10:55,00:10:57,"he goes to the Melbourne Botanical Gardens,"
00:10:57,00:10:58,and he gets some tree-hugging time in.
00:10:58,00:10:59,- Does he? - Does he.
00:10:59,00:11:00,- Does he? - Yeah.
00:11:00,00:11:01,"- Is that 'cause he kisses the grass as well, doesn't he?"
00:11:01,00:11:03,I know he tastes the grass at Wimbledon.
00:11:03,00:11:04,"- Yeah, he eats. - Eats it."
00:11:04,00:11:06,"- Yeah, right? - Yeah, must be related."
00:11:06,00:11:07,"- Yeah. - Tree-hugging,"
00:11:07,00:11:11,tree-huggers used to be squirrel killers.
00:11:11,00:11:15,"I was looking for the first references to tree-hugger,"
00:11:15,00:11:17,"and a lot of people say that it came from the '70s,"
00:11:17,00:11:19,but the OED says first reference
00:11:19,00:11:21,"to someone being a tree-hugger in a hippie,"
00:11:21,00:11:23,please stop building this motorway here
00:11:23,00:11:25,because it involves felling trees way.
00:11:25,00:11:30,"It's 1965, and so there are a few people in Appleton,"
00:11:30,00:11:32,"fittingly, Wisconsin, who were named that"
00:11:32,00:11:33,'cause Apple is a kind of tree.
00:11:33,00:11:35,(laughing)
00:11:35,00:11:38,"But at the same time, in 1965, in Indiana,"
00:11:38,00:11:41,"they were using tree-hugger to describe squirrel hunters,"
00:11:41,00:11:44,and it was because they basically hide behind a tree
00:11:44,00:11:45,"that's thicker than them,"
00:11:45,00:11:47,"a tree whose girth is larger than them,"
00:11:47,00:11:49,"watching squirrels, and then dart to another tree"
00:11:49,00:11:53,"and hug that tree, and then eventually kill a squirrel."
00:11:53,00:11:55,Although it does say that all tree-huggers
00:11:55,00:11:57,"are possessed with a love of the outdoors,"
00:11:57,00:11:59,and actually catching a squirrel
00:11:59,00:12:01,isn't an iron-clad must any more than it is
00:12:01,00:12:03,"for a fisherman to catch a fish,"
00:12:03,00:12:05,which means I've fully misunderstood fishing as well.
00:12:05,00:12:07,(laughing)
00:12:07,00:12:10,"- That first citation in the OED from 1965,"
00:12:10,00:12:13,"it was in South Shore, Chicago."
00:12:13,00:12:16,"They were building a new road through a lot of parks,"
00:12:16,00:12:18,"and they had to chop down some trees,"
00:12:18,00:12:21,and all of these conservationists sort of hugged the trees
00:12:21,00:12:23,and tried to stop them from doing it.
00:12:23,00:12:25,And it turns out that one of the protesters
00:12:25,00:12:27,was called Bernard Baum.
00:12:27,00:12:30,And Baum is German for tree.
00:12:30,00:12:31,- Yes. - Oh.
00:12:31,00:12:33,- Come on. - That's very good.
00:12:33,00:12:34,"We're gonna have to move on in a sec, guys."
00:12:34,00:12:38,"- Oh, can I tell you another sort of competition-related fact"
00:12:38,00:12:39,that has something to do with trees?
00:12:39,00:12:41,It's about the World Concord Championships.
00:12:41,00:12:42,Have you guys read this?
00:12:42,00:12:44,"Breaking news. - Yes, literally breaking."
00:12:44,00:12:46,- It's literally happening right now before our very eyes.
00:12:46,00:12:48,The investigation is going on.
00:12:48,00:12:50,"It just happened in Northamptonshire,"
00:12:50,00:12:52,and allegations of cheating.
00:12:52,00:12:54,And it's very serious.
00:12:54,00:12:56,There's this guy called David Jacobs.
00:12:56,00:12:57,He's 82.
00:12:57,00:13:00,He's been competing since 1977.
00:13:00,00:13:02,Every year goes to the World Concord Championships.
00:13:02,00:13:04,He won this time.
00:13:04,00:13:08,And now there are allegations he used as steel conker.
00:13:08,00:13:10,"- And it was the first time he won, maybe?"
00:13:10,00:13:11,"- Yeah, yeah, it was the first time he's won."
00:13:11,00:13:13,"- Yeah, yeah. - Also, he's the chief judge."
00:13:13,00:13:14,This goes all the way to the top.
00:13:14,00:13:16,"- Yeah. - It's like, yeah."
00:13:16,00:13:18,- It's just like the dales all over.
00:13:18,00:13:19,"- Absolutely. - He's got a painted,"
00:13:19,00:13:22,"he had a painted nut, which he said was just for humor value."
00:13:22,00:13:24,"What's the humor value in, I guess,"
00:13:24,00:13:27,"it's a bit, if you play conkers, I guess it's funny."
00:13:27,00:13:28,- Yeah. - I guess.
00:13:28,00:13:31,- But it turns out he was concealing steel.
00:13:31,00:13:32,"- Well, did he use the steel nut"
00:13:32,00:13:34,to smash his opponents' conkers to pieces?
00:13:34,00:13:35,"'Cause a couple of the opponents said,"
00:13:35,00:13:38,"""My conker just exploded when he tapped it for the first time."""
00:13:38,00:13:40,"And yeah, this is a huge, this is huge."
00:13:40,00:13:42,"- And we just want to say for the lawyers,"
00:13:42,00:13:44,nothing's been proven either way yet.
00:13:44,00:13:45,It's all still underway.
00:13:45,00:13:47,And he was actually defeated in the final.
00:13:47,00:13:49,"It seems like they must be gender divided until the end,"
00:13:49,00:13:51,"'cause he won the men's section,"
00:13:51,00:13:54,but then he was defeated by Kelsey Banshbuck
00:13:54,00:13:57,"from Indianapolis, who came all the way to Northamptonshire"
00:13:57,00:13:59,to defeat him in the final.
00:13:59,00:14:00,- Wow. - Wow.
00:14:00,00:14:01,- First American to win.
00:14:01,00:14:02,- And what was she using?
00:14:02,00:14:04,"Like a platinum, a cover?"
00:14:04,00:14:06,(all laughing)
00:14:06,00:14:08,"- Put the conker in a shotgun, yeah."
00:14:08,00:14:09,- Can I tell you one more--
00:14:09,00:14:10,"- Yeah, go for it. - Natural competition."
00:14:10,00:14:12,This was in 2002 in Australia.
00:14:12,00:14:14,They had a sheep counting competition.
00:14:14,00:14:15,"- Oh, yeah."
00:14:15,00:14:17,"- Like there were 10 competitors,"
00:14:17,00:14:19,they ran 400 sheep past them.
00:14:19,00:14:20,- 400.
00:14:20,00:14:22,(all laughing)
00:14:22,00:14:24,"- No, they didn't tell them they were 400,"
00:14:24,00:14:26,but you had to count them as they ran past you.
00:14:26,00:14:28,There was an indeterminate number of sheep running past you
00:14:28,00:14:29,and you had to count them.
00:14:29,00:14:31,- I would count the legs and divide by four.
00:14:31,00:14:33,(all laughing)
00:14:33,00:14:34,- Show off. - Very good.
00:14:34,00:14:35,- And is it the idea
00:14:35,00:14:37,whoever's awake at the end is the winner?
00:14:37,00:14:37,- That's it.
00:14:37,00:14:40,(upbeat music)
00:14:43,00:14:47,"- Okay, it is time for us to move on to fact number two,"
00:14:47,00:14:48,and that is Anna.
00:14:48,00:14:52,- My fact this week is that the wax coating
00:14:52,00:14:57,"on 6,400 shot bought apples is enough to make one tea light."
00:14:57,00:14:58,- Wow.
00:14:58,00:15:00,"- Yes, apples, tomatoes, lemons, peppers,"
00:15:00,00:15:02,"you get in shops, it's all covered in wax,"
00:15:02,00:15:05,but it's a very tiny layer.
00:15:05,00:15:07,"There's lots of rumours that it can give you, you know,"
00:15:07,00:15:09,cancer and make your head explode and stuff.
00:15:09,00:15:11,"So I thought, I wonder how much they're actually putting on."
00:15:11,00:15:14,And I read that one pound of wax
00:15:14,00:15:17,"will cover 160,000 pieces of fruit"
00:15:17,00:15:20,"and one pound of wax also makes,"
00:15:20,00:15:22,"according to various craft sites,"
00:15:22,00:15:23,"which I spent a long time on,"
00:15:23,00:15:26,but I think one pound of wax makes about 25 tea candles.
00:15:26,00:15:29,"And so there you go, 6,400 apples,"
00:15:29,00:15:32,"melt the wax off, you've got a tea light, you're welcome."
00:15:32,00:15:33,(all laughing)
00:15:33,00:15:36,"- And a tea light is one of those little white round ones,"
00:15:36,00:15:37,is it?
00:15:37,00:15:38,"'Cause I had to look this up, actually."
00:15:38,00:15:40,- That is such a man thing to do.
00:15:40,00:15:41,(all laughing)
00:15:41,00:15:44,"- No man listening knows what a tea light is,"
00:15:44,00:15:46,"and no woman listening doesn't, it's just a..."
00:15:46,00:15:50,- And they were invented to make tea with or something.
00:15:50,00:15:52,"I read that, I don't know if this is true,"
00:15:52,00:15:53,"'cause I didn't know what they were,"
00:15:53,00:15:56,"but apparently in the Japanese tea ceremony,"
00:15:56,00:15:58,you have put them underneath your kettle to keep it warm.
00:15:58,00:16:00,"- Oh my God, this is so weird,"
00:16:00,00:16:02,"because I've got a small kettle at home,"
00:16:02,00:16:04,which has a tea light underneath it
00:16:04,00:16:05,for making the water warm.
00:16:05,00:16:07,And I just thought that was a gimmick
00:16:07,00:16:08,"that they found to do with the tea light,"
00:16:08,00:16:10,but you're telling me that's the original purpose.
00:16:10,00:16:13,- It looks like it has enough flame to keep something heat.
00:16:13,00:16:15,"- Probably just sort of keep, you know, maintain."
00:16:15,00:16:17,- Just a little simmery.
00:16:17,00:16:19,- The wax is so weird.
00:16:19,00:16:22,So this happens even more in America
00:16:22,00:16:23,than it does in the UK.
00:16:23,00:16:24,"Like in America, everything is sold"
00:16:24,00:16:27,"with a thin layer of wax on the top of it, basically."
00:16:27,00:16:28,"- I think it's pretty much all fruit,"
00:16:28,00:16:29,like all apples you buy in the shop here.
00:16:29,00:16:30,"Yeah, all fruit you buy here"
00:16:30,00:16:32,will also have all the other wax on it.
00:16:32,00:16:35,"- But it's this thing called epicuticular wax,"
00:16:35,00:16:36,like cuticles is in skin.
00:16:36,00:16:40,"And the thing is, apples grow with a thin layer"
00:16:40,00:16:43,"of wax on them, which is then removed"
00:16:43,00:16:45,during the harvesting process.
00:16:45,00:16:47,"And they think, oh no, we lost all the wax"
00:16:47,00:16:49,that was growing beautifully on the apple anyway.
00:16:49,00:16:53,So they put wax from a different species back on the apple.
00:16:53,00:16:56,- So I have a tree in my garden.
00:16:56,00:16:57,"- Oh no. - It's no, Dan."
00:16:57,00:16:59,Leave it alone.
00:16:59,00:17:01,"- Well, no, I took an apple off the tree"
00:17:01,00:17:02,and it was very exciting.
00:17:02,00:17:05,"It was like, my God, I've got an apple from my own garden."
00:17:05,00:17:08,And it was so waxy that even when I washed it
00:17:08,00:17:11,"under the sink, it just took ages to get off."
00:17:11,00:17:16,"Yeah, and I stupidly used washing liquid on it"
00:17:16,00:17:18,at one point to try and get it off.
00:17:18,00:17:21,"But yeah, I felt it literally the other day."
00:17:21,00:17:22,"- That's cool 'cause it's quite,"
00:17:22,00:17:25,usually on fruit it's quite powdery and unsightly.
00:17:25,00:17:27,"You often see it on plums, it's most obvious,"
00:17:27,00:17:28,it's like a white powder.
00:17:28,00:17:29,But why did you want to take it off?
00:17:29,00:17:30,It's fine.
00:17:30,00:17:31,- What do you mean?
00:17:31,00:17:32,"Oh, I thought you meant off the tree to eat it."
00:17:32,00:17:34,(laughing)
00:17:34,00:17:37,"- Oh, no, no, it just felt odd, it just felt."
00:17:37,00:17:37,- But it grows back.
00:17:37,00:17:39,"Even if it gets scratched or removed during the harvesting,"
00:17:39,00:17:41,it would grow back naturally.
00:17:41,00:17:43,"But during those few days,"
00:17:43,00:17:44,the fruit would shrink a little bit
00:17:44,00:17:46,'cause it's lost a layer of protection
00:17:46,00:17:47,and it would lose a little bit of volume.
00:17:47,00:17:48,"- Moisture, right."
00:17:48,00:17:49,- Moisture.
00:17:49,00:17:51,And so it's worth spraying the wax on
00:17:51,00:17:53,because it keeps the fruit at exactly the same size
00:17:53,00:17:55,for that little few days in between.
00:17:55,00:17:56,"- Yeah, it's essential."
00:17:56,00:17:59,Fruit would be shriveled in the process of making it
00:17:59,00:18:02,"through the, you know, importing it,"
00:18:02,00:18:04,getting it into a short process if we didn't have it on.
00:18:04,00:18:05,For the same reason they have it on trees.
00:18:05,00:18:08,"It's so that nothing can get in, nothing can get out."
00:18:08,00:18:09,"- But the wax that grows on plants,"
00:18:09,00:18:11,"this is, okay, this is unbelievable."
00:18:11,00:18:13,"So it's amazing stuff, epi-cuticular wax."
00:18:13,00:18:14,It's really cool.
00:18:14,00:18:15,"It repels water, it repels,"
00:18:15,00:18:17,"that's why plants are clean,"
00:18:17,00:18:18,"despite the fact that, you know,"
00:18:18,00:18:19,"water has all sorts of stuff in it,"
00:18:19,00:18:21,the water just rolls off.
00:18:21,00:18:24,"The other thing is, it makes it hard sometimes"
00:18:24,00:18:27,if the plant wants to protect itself from insects
00:18:27,00:18:29,or other pests.
00:18:29,00:18:33,The wax itself makes it hard for the insects to walk on.
00:18:33,00:18:35,They fall off because the wax is kind of like
00:18:35,00:18:37,a travelator or whatever. - That's cool.
00:18:37,00:18:41,"- And this is, there's an even more weird bit to it."
00:18:41,00:18:43,There is co-evolution.
00:18:43,00:18:45,So some plants rely on a single insect
00:18:45,00:18:48,to walk all over them and fertilize the flowers
00:18:48,00:18:50,or whatever it might be.
00:18:50,00:18:55,Some plants have kind of password protected wax.
00:18:55,00:18:57,So only their chosen insect partner
00:18:57,00:19:00,can walk along the leaves and the stems
00:19:00,00:19:02,without falling off and everything else falls off.
00:19:02,00:19:05,The insect's legs are the password.
00:19:05,00:19:06,"- Oh, just hang on."
00:19:06,00:19:08,So does the insect's legs specially designed?
00:19:08,00:19:10,They've got little wax skates on their feet
00:19:10,00:19:12,or does the plant alter when it feels like an insect?
00:19:12,00:19:14,- Is it like using your fingerprint to open your phone?
00:19:14,00:19:15,"- Yes, it's exactly like that."
00:19:15,00:19:18,- This is why King Charles talks to plants.
00:19:18,00:19:19,They're fucking sentient.
00:19:19,00:19:21,"- Oh no, not this again."
00:19:21,00:19:22,- Come on.
00:19:22,00:19:23,- But it's amazing.
00:19:23,00:19:24,I just found that.
00:19:24,00:19:25,- Wow.
00:19:25,00:19:26,- Yeah.
00:19:26,00:19:30,"- By the way, if they are sentient then"
00:19:30,00:19:31,you've got a lot of consent to get.
00:19:31,00:19:34,(laughing)
00:19:34,00:19:40,- Operation U Tree's got nothing on you.
00:19:40,00:19:43,(laughing)
00:19:43,00:19:48,- Anyway.
00:19:48,00:19:50,- It's a huge industry.
00:19:50,00:19:53,The making wax to preserve food in industry.
00:19:53,00:19:57,"And it's actually, it was patented in the 1920s"
00:19:57,00:20:00,and Brogdon's original wax and kerosene makers
00:20:00,00:20:03,who painted it went to the Supreme Court to defend it.
00:20:03,00:20:04,This is how big a deal it is.
00:20:04,00:20:07,"And these days, things get dipped in baths of it."
00:20:07,00:20:09,"So when you're eating a melon,"
00:20:09,00:20:12,it might have had a bath in wax before it came to you.
00:20:12,00:20:15,"- And it could be made of lots of different types of wax,"
00:20:15,00:20:15,right?
00:20:15,00:20:18,I think you said kerosene so you can get like paraffin wax.
00:20:18,00:20:20,Quite a lot of it is.
00:20:20,00:20:22,And then there's other ones that are less sound like
00:20:22,00:20:24,they've come for the petrochemical industry.
00:20:24,00:20:26,"- Bees wax, they used to do it in."
00:20:26,00:20:28,"Bees wax is every, you know what?"
00:20:28,00:20:30,"Bees get a lot of credit for honey,"
00:20:30,00:20:32,but people don't talk about the wax that much.
00:20:32,00:20:34,"- In the middle ages, they went on about it a lot."
00:20:34,00:20:35,- Did they?
00:20:35,00:20:36,- Oh my God.
00:20:36,00:20:37,(laughing)
00:20:37,00:20:39,They really wanked on about it properly.
00:20:39,00:20:41,- I think they were quite right.
00:20:41,00:20:42,"- Well, because like in those days,"
00:20:42,00:20:45,"you had to light your house with candles, right?"
00:20:45,00:20:49,"And if you were just a normal person, a pleb like me,"
00:20:49,00:20:51,then you would get it using tallow.
00:20:51,00:20:53,"So you would cook your meat,"
00:20:53,00:20:55,and then there would be some fat there.
00:20:55,00:20:57,"And then a chandler, a candle maker would come round"
00:20:57,00:21:01,to your house and he'd pick up all of the goo
00:21:01,00:21:03,and he'd turn it into a candle and you would burn it.
00:21:03,00:21:03,But it would stink.
00:21:03,00:21:05,"It would really, really stink."
00:21:05,00:21:07,And all the houses would smell of burnt rubbish.
00:21:07,00:21:10,"But then the church decided, well, we don't want that."
00:21:10,00:21:12,We want perfect white candles.
00:21:12,00:21:15,And we want it not to smell like old garbage.
00:21:15,00:21:17,And so they had to have beeswax.
00:21:17,00:21:21,And the beeswax industry in that time was off the charts.
00:21:21,00:21:23,They were like wars because the price
00:21:23,00:21:25,of beeswax went too high.
00:21:25,00:21:26,- Right.
00:21:26,00:21:27,"- And they used it for everything, right?"
00:21:27,00:21:29,"They used it for lubricant, for waterproofing,"
00:21:29,00:21:31,for all cosmetics are made of beeswax.
00:21:31,00:21:33,They didn't really have any other materials
00:21:33,00:21:34,"except beeswax, practically."
00:21:34,00:21:36,"- The other reason it was so good in church is,"
00:21:36,00:21:40,"is because they thought that bees were virgin born,"
00:21:40,00:21:41,like Jesus.
00:21:41,00:21:42,- Oh.
00:21:42,00:21:43,- There was this thing.
00:21:43,00:21:46,"And if you own bees and you look in your beehive,"
00:21:46,00:21:47,they never have sex.
00:21:47,00:21:50,"You can sit there watching them as long as you want, Dan."
00:21:50,00:21:52,They will not have sex.
00:21:52,00:21:56,"Because they go, they kind of find a little region"
00:21:56,00:21:59,"and they all fly, all the drones fly to this little region"
00:21:59,00:22:01,and then the queen flies there as well.
00:22:01,00:22:03,And then they have sex in the air while they're flying.
00:22:03,00:22:05,And then they all come back.
00:22:05,00:22:06,So no one ever saw them have sex
00:22:06,00:22:07,or they thought they were virgins.
00:22:07,00:22:09,- But that's the same as humans.
00:22:09,00:22:11,"I never see humans have sex because very similarly,"
00:22:11,00:22:15,they go to a special place where I'm not allowed
00:22:15,00:22:17,and they have sex there.
00:22:17,00:22:19,I don't assume everyone's a virgin
00:22:19,00:22:22,just because I haven't seen any of them shagging.
00:22:22,00:22:24,"People were stupid in the middle ages, weren't they?"
00:22:24,00:22:25,- Wow.
00:22:25,00:22:28,Can I tell you a thing about ancient Roman beeswax?
00:22:28,00:22:28,This is so cool.
00:22:28,00:22:29,"Okay, I love this."
00:22:29,00:22:33,So you would have a wax mast made of yourself
00:22:33,00:22:35,"and it was for use in life,"
00:22:35,00:22:37,but it was also for use at your funeral.
00:22:37,00:22:39,- What would you use it for in life?
00:22:39,00:22:39,- I'm getting onto that.
00:22:39,00:22:40,Jesus.
00:22:40,00:22:43,"- Sorry, you went straight to death."
00:22:43,00:22:44,"- Sorry, sorry, sorry."
00:22:44,00:22:45,"But it's all connected, that's the weird thing."
00:22:45,00:22:50,"So about the age we all are, about 35 to 40,"
00:22:50,00:22:52,you would have a wax mask made of yourself
00:22:52,00:22:54,"and when you had reached political high office,"
00:22:54,00:22:57,"that's the four of us all have, sure,"
00:22:57,00:22:58,"you would have them in your hall,"
00:22:58,00:23:01,"but you would also have your ancestors wax masks,"
00:23:01,00:23:03,"normally male ones, but often some female ones too,"
00:23:03,00:23:05,if you're a very politically connected family.
00:23:05,00:23:08,"And at a funeral, you would hire a load of men"
00:23:08,00:23:12,to wear these masks and pretend to be your male ancestors.
00:23:12,00:23:13,"And if it was your funeral,"
00:23:13,00:23:16,"someone would be wearing a mask of you at your funeral,"
00:23:16,00:23:21,"dressed as you, dressed as the highest office you've achieved,"
00:23:21,00:23:25,they would wear like a podcaster uniform or whatever.
00:23:25,00:23:27,- Is this the highest office we're gonna achieve?
00:23:27,00:23:29,- I'm afraid so.
00:23:29,00:23:30,"- Yeah, they would take the piss out of you a bit as well,"
00:23:30,00:23:31,wouldn't they?
00:23:31,00:23:32,- They would.
00:23:32,00:23:33,- I think they would wear this mask and wear your clothes
00:23:33,00:23:35,"and then go up to your friends and go,"
00:23:35,00:23:36,"""Oh, I'm an idiot."""
00:23:36,00:23:39,- That's quite nice.
00:23:39,00:23:40,Why did we stop doing it?
00:23:40,00:23:41,- I don't know.
00:23:41,00:23:42,- And then we should bring it back.
00:23:42,00:23:45,"- The fall of Rome, yet again, screwing everything up."
00:23:45,00:23:47,"But the other thing you would have in your front hall,"
00:23:47,00:23:48,"you would have this wall of faces,"
00:23:48,00:23:50,"like here are my male ancestors,"
00:23:50,00:23:52,"you would have a wall of your family tree,"
00:23:52,00:23:55,and you would have a wall of military spoils
00:23:55,00:23:57,that your family had seized in battle.
00:23:57,00:23:58,"So as someone came into your front hall,"
00:23:58,00:24:00,"they would get the full works of like,"
00:24:00,00:24:03,"""Here is what a great kind of guy I am."""
00:24:03,00:24:04,- Nice.
00:24:04,00:24:07,"- Hey, actually, back to candles and sex,"
00:24:07,00:24:08,were we talking about that at all?
00:24:08,00:24:09,"- Yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:24:09,00:24:11,- Have you guys read about brothel candles?
00:24:11,00:24:12,- No.
00:24:12,00:24:13,- I think I can guess what they are.
00:24:13,00:24:15,"- Yeah, so this is interesting."
00:24:15,00:24:16,"This is around the 1880s,"
00:24:16,00:24:19,and it was into the early 1900s.
00:24:19,00:24:22,"The idea was that in the brothel itself,"
00:24:22,00:24:24,every sex worker there would have a candle
00:24:24,00:24:26,"that would burn down in seven minutes,"
00:24:26,00:24:28,and that's how you knew when the session was over.
00:24:28,00:24:30,"- That's a lot of pressure,"
00:24:30,00:24:32,"which you don't want, do you?"
00:24:32,00:24:33,That's gonna ruin it.
00:24:33,00:24:36,"I mean, you know,"
00:24:36,00:24:38,"I'm not asking you personally down,"
00:24:38,00:24:40,and I don't want to know the answer.
00:24:40,00:24:42,- You got any seven second candles?
00:24:42,00:24:45,(laughing)
00:24:45,00:24:47,(upbeat music)
00:24:47,00:24:53,"- It is time for fact number three,"
00:24:53,00:24:54,and that is James.
00:24:54,00:24:56,"- Okay, my fact this week"
00:24:56,00:25:00,is that the first known example of mastitis
00:25:00,00:25:03,was in an empress called a tosser.
00:25:03,00:25:04,(laughing)
00:25:04,00:25:06,"She was cured,"
00:25:06,00:25:08,and the doctor's payment was to be allowed
00:25:08,00:25:10,to invade Greece.
00:25:10,00:25:12,(laughing)
00:25:12,00:25:17,"- Yeah, so we're talking the Achaemenid Empire,"
00:25:17,00:25:19,"as I'm sure you all know,"
00:25:19,00:25:22,based in Iran in the fifth century BC.
00:25:22,00:25:24,"They were the biggest empire in the world at the time,"
00:25:24,00:25:27,"and then eventually they went on and fought the Greeks,"
00:25:27,00:25:30,"and if you know that movie, The 300, I think it's called,"
00:25:30,00:25:32,"- It's a documentary, isn't it?"
00:25:32,00:25:33,- It's a documentary.
00:25:33,00:25:35,"Well, it's about 300 Spartans"
00:25:35,00:25:37,"who fought against all these Persians,"
00:25:37,00:25:40,and these are the bad guys in that movie.
00:25:40,00:25:43,"- Oh, yes, they got a very, very bad rap,"
00:25:43,00:25:45,"the Persians in this film,"
00:25:45,00:25:49,as in the portrayal as being really dreadful types.
00:25:49,00:25:51,"- Well, they were like, I haven't seen the movie,"
00:25:51,00:25:54,"but they're like, they were super soldiers."
00:25:54,00:25:56,"- Normally when you say, I haven't seen the movie,"
00:25:56,00:25:57,"it's 'cause we're talking about quite a good movie,"
00:25:57,00:26:01,and you absolutely don't have to watch 300.
00:26:01,00:26:02,- That's good to know.
00:26:02,00:26:04,"I haven't watched the first 299,"
00:26:04,00:26:06,so I wouldn't know what was happening anyway.
00:26:06,00:26:11,"- So, Etosse, she was the daughter of King Cyrus the Great,"
00:26:11,00:26:14,"she was the wife of Darius the Great,"
00:26:14,00:26:16,and she was the mother of Xerxes the Great.
00:26:16,00:26:18,- Okay.
00:26:18,00:26:20,"- So, behind every great man, there was Etosse."
00:26:20,00:26:23,(audience laughing)
00:26:23,00:26:26,"And she was like, a lot of what we know about her"
00:26:26,00:26:28,"was written by Herodotus,"
00:26:28,00:26:31,and he basically put her as the power behind the throne
00:26:31,00:26:33,in all these different situations.
00:26:33,00:26:34,- And he was Greek.
00:26:34,00:26:36,"- And he was Greek, so he was writing about them, yeah."
00:26:36,00:26:40,"- Yeah, she was also a wife twice, right?"
00:26:40,00:26:43,"- Three, I think."
00:26:43,00:26:45,"- Okay, but she married her brother at one point, didn't she?"
00:26:45,00:26:46,- She did marry her brother.
00:26:46,00:26:47,- Not her choice.
00:26:47,00:26:48,- No.
00:26:48,00:26:49,- His choice.
00:26:49,00:26:50,- His choice.
00:26:50,00:26:51,"It was kind of a dumb thing at the time,"
00:26:51,00:26:55,"and her brother was basically trying to get the empire,"
00:26:55,00:26:57,"and he thought that this,"
00:26:57,00:26:59,a bit like the Egyptians would sometimes marry brothers
00:26:59,00:27:02,and sisters because it would make them a stronger unit.
00:27:02,00:27:05,"- Well, I think it was illegal to do that."
00:27:05,00:27:07,"- It wasn't, he made it legal."
00:27:07,00:27:08,"- Yeah, that's a good thing about being king,"
00:27:08,00:27:10,"and he actually married two of his sisters, didn't he?"
00:27:10,00:27:12,"He married her and another sister,"
00:27:12,00:27:14,and I think he might have married his niece
00:27:14,00:27:15,at one point as well.
00:27:15,00:27:17,"- Wait, was that, was that Cambyses, just to be?"
00:27:17,00:27:18,"- Yeah, Cambyses, yeah."
00:27:18,00:27:20,- The first husband of a tosser.
00:27:20,00:27:20,- Yeah.
00:27:20,00:27:21,- Okay.
00:27:21,00:27:22,"- But you were quite limited,"
00:27:22,00:27:24,"because if you belonged to one of the noble,"
00:27:24,00:27:26,"poshest families, or the royal family at that time,"
00:27:26,00:27:29,"you could only marry someone from the seven,"
00:27:29,00:27:31,"which is such a cool thing to be a member of,"
00:27:31,00:27:33,and it was the seven most important families.
00:27:33,00:27:35,- So it was a small pool.
00:27:35,00:27:37,"- I think Snow White had the same issue, didn't she?"
00:27:37,00:27:39,(laughing)
00:27:39,00:27:44,"- But then Cambyses, the brother, went away,"
00:27:44,00:27:47,"and their brother, Bardia, usurped the throne."
00:27:47,00:27:50,"This is all kind of very, very late gossip of the,"
00:27:50,00:27:51,how's it pronounced?
00:27:51,00:27:52,Akameneid?
00:27:52,00:27:53,- The Akimeneid.
00:27:53,00:27:54,- Or Persian.
00:27:54,00:27:54,- Just call it the Persian.
00:27:54,00:27:56,"- Persian, the Persian empire."
00:27:56,00:27:59,"But then the person, Darius the Great,"
00:27:59,00:28:01,"was the one who became her big deal husband,"
00:28:01,00:28:06,"and he assassinated Bardia, who was the usurper."
00:28:06,00:28:08,"And then to sort of cement his control of power,"
00:28:08,00:28:13,he married all Cyrus the Great's female descendants.
00:28:13,00:28:14,- Yeah.
00:28:14,00:28:16,"- As in just, he married the whole family."
00:28:16,00:28:17,- It was a different time.
00:28:17,00:28:18,- It was a different time.
00:28:18,00:28:20,- Not so many trees in Persia.
00:28:20,00:28:21,- No.
00:28:21,00:28:22,(laughing)
00:28:22,00:28:24,"- Yeah, they were brutal, though, weren't they,"
00:28:24,00:28:27,"the Persians, with the torture that they did."
00:28:27,00:28:28,"- Oh, really?"
00:28:28,00:28:30,"- Well, it's just the examples are wild."
00:28:30,00:28:32,"Like, I was reading about, so Cambyses,"
00:28:32,00:28:36,he had a judge who had done some behind the scenes stuff
00:28:36,00:28:38,that he was unhappy with.
00:28:38,00:28:42,"And so he basically had this judge killed,"
00:28:42,00:28:44,"and then stripped of his skin,"
00:28:44,00:28:47,and then to remind any next judge
00:28:47,00:28:49,"not to do all the bad stuff that this guy had done,"
00:28:49,00:28:53,they laid the strips of his skin over the judge's chair
00:28:53,00:28:55,"that the next judge had to sit on, right?"
00:28:55,00:28:59,So the next judge was sitting on the previous judge.
00:28:59,00:28:59,- Wow.
00:28:59,00:29:02,- And the next judge was the son of the previous judge.
00:29:02,00:29:03,"- Oh, no."
00:29:03,00:29:05,"- By the way, so weird that the groan came"
00:29:05,00:29:06,only when I said the son had to sit
00:29:06,00:29:09,on the skin of the guitar.
00:29:09,00:29:11,- But is it possible that this is a load
00:29:11,00:29:13,of kind of Greek-y propaganda?
00:29:13,00:29:15,"'Cause I think most, like loads of what we know about Persia"
00:29:15,00:29:18,"comes from historians like Herodotus, who were Greek,"
00:29:18,00:29:21,and had a good reason for--
00:29:21,00:29:22,- That is true.
00:29:22,00:29:25,"- In fact, a tosser who is written about"
00:29:25,00:29:29,as the most important powerful female member
00:29:29,00:29:34,"of the Achaemenid Empire, also maybe didn't exist."
00:29:34,00:29:36,"Maybe, so-- - Wow, why?"
00:29:36,00:29:39,"- Well, she's the only sources we have are Herodotus,"
00:29:39,00:29:41,who famously made up a lot of shit.
00:29:41,00:29:43,"I sometimes like to think that Herodotus just made it all up,"
00:29:43,00:29:45,and basically everything we know
00:29:45,00:29:48,about Greek and Persian history is just from his head.
00:29:48,00:29:50,"But I think it's Herodotus, an Aeschylus play"
00:29:50,00:29:53,"that mentioned her, but so it could be."
00:29:53,00:29:55,"- Well, we know that Darius existed."
00:29:55,00:29:56,"- Definitely, and Cyrus the Great--"
00:29:56,00:29:58,"- I think Cyrus existed, and Xerxes existed."
00:29:58,00:30:00,"- 100%, Cyrus the Great was great, by the way."
00:30:00,00:30:01,"- Oh, yeah."
00:30:01,00:30:04,"- You know, you read about old kings, emperors, et cetera,"
00:30:04,00:30:05,and they're all bastards.
00:30:05,00:30:08,"Cyrus the Great, he's one of those annoying people,"
00:30:08,00:30:11,"he's just a good, all-round guy."
00:30:11,00:30:13,"He's just constantly doing nice stuff,"
00:30:13,00:30:15,so he forgave people constantly.
00:30:15,00:30:18,"He was very famous for when he invaded somewhere,"
00:30:18,00:30:20,"he'd, instead of killing people or taking them prisoner,"
00:30:20,00:30:22,he'd draw them into his bureaucracy
00:30:22,00:30:24,or into the top of his military.
00:30:24,00:30:26,He was the grandson of this guy.
00:30:26,00:30:27,- What a nice guy.
00:30:27,00:30:28,(laughing)
00:30:28,00:30:29,"- What, that is nice."
00:30:29,00:30:32,- I've taken over your entire country.
00:30:32,00:30:33,I'm gonna let you join my side.
00:30:33,00:30:35,- It was a different time.
00:30:35,00:30:36,- It was a different time.
00:30:36,00:30:37,- It is a different time.
00:30:37,00:30:39,"- It was, that meant good in those days."
00:30:39,00:30:41,He famously captured Babylon.
00:30:41,00:30:43,"He did it quite cleverly at night,"
00:30:43,00:30:47,so he overnight managed to divert the whole river Euphrates
00:30:47,00:30:50,into a canal so that his soldiers could just walk
00:30:50,00:30:54,"across a riverbed, and so he arrived in Babylon."
00:30:54,00:30:56,"Everyone in Babylon woke up and gave up,"
00:30:56,00:30:57,"well, oh my God, how did you get here?"
00:30:57,00:30:59,"And he released all the Jews there,"
00:30:59,00:31:01,"had been taken captive there,"
00:31:01,00:31:03,"and said, you know, said you can go back to Jerusalem,"
00:31:03,00:31:05,so Jewish people loved him.
00:31:05,00:31:08,"He defeated his grandpa, who tried to murder him,"
00:31:08,00:31:10,"and immediately forgave him,"
00:31:10,00:31:12,"although I think he killed all of his grandpa's kids,"
00:31:12,00:31:14,'cause they might be threats.
00:31:14,00:31:15,But every good guy--
00:31:15,00:31:16,- Does that include his dad?
00:31:16,00:31:21,"- I don't think it did include his dad, no."
00:31:21,00:31:22,He didn't include his own dad.
00:31:22,00:31:25,"- You really, the more you talk about this Cyrus guy,"
00:31:25,00:31:26,the less unconvinced you--
00:31:26,00:31:29,"- Yeah, he was the guy who started this army"
00:31:29,00:31:32,"that's in the 300, and they were known as the Immortals,"
00:31:32,00:31:35,"and there were 10,000 of them in this army."
00:31:35,00:31:36,"And the way that they did it was,"
00:31:36,00:31:41,if ever any of them got killed or injured or a bit sick
00:31:41,00:31:44,"or just didn't fancy it, then they would go off,"
00:31:44,00:31:45,they would take them off the battlefield
00:31:45,00:31:47,and immediately replace them with someone else.
00:31:47,00:31:48,- Right.
00:31:48,00:31:51,"- So as far as you're concerned, the enemy,"
00:31:51,00:31:53,"there are always 10,000 of them,"
00:31:53,00:31:54,and so you think they are immortal.
00:31:54,00:31:57,- Can you just tap out by raising a hand?
00:31:57,00:31:58,(all laughing)
00:31:58,00:32:00,I've really had a great time.
00:32:00,00:32:03,"I've met a lot of friends, but I'm done."
00:32:03,00:32:04,- Is it like NFL?
00:32:04,00:32:05,Is that what they do in NFL?
00:32:05,00:32:07,"- Oh yeah, bring on the offense."
00:32:07,00:32:08,I think they're all offense in this case.
00:32:08,00:32:09,(all laughing)
00:32:09,00:32:11,They were tiaras.
00:32:11,00:32:14,"They were called tiaras, but they were actually felt caps."
00:32:14,00:32:15,- Right.
00:32:15,00:32:18,"- And the main thing they used was a spear,"
00:32:18,00:32:19,"and it was a really long spear,"
00:32:19,00:32:22,"and they had a counterbalance at the end of the spear,"
00:32:22,00:32:25,"and the counterbalance would be a different type of fruit,"
00:32:25,00:32:27,depending on how good you were.
00:32:27,00:32:28,So the best possible thing you could have
00:32:28,00:32:31,"was a little like an apple at the end of your spear,"
00:32:31,00:32:33,and then you were part of the apple regiment.
00:32:33,00:32:35,"- Well, 'cause that meant you had to suspend"
00:32:35,00:32:37,"more weight at the front,"
00:32:37,00:32:38,or as if you had like a watermelon.
00:32:38,00:32:40,"- Yeah, so the counterbalance was so that you could have"
00:32:40,00:32:42,"a longer spear and it wouldn't dip down,"
00:32:42,00:32:45,"but actually the weight of the thing would always be the same,"
00:32:45,00:32:46,it would just be in the shape of an apple
00:32:46,00:32:49,or a banana or a grape or something.
00:32:49,00:32:49,- That's nice.
00:32:49,00:32:51,- I'm trying to think of a really shit fruit
00:32:51,00:32:55,"if you had a raspberry or something on the end, or..."
00:32:55,00:32:58,"- They were kind of famously luxury-loving the Persians,"
00:32:58,00:32:59,and this again is a lot of propaganda
00:32:59,00:33:01,that was dished out by the Greeks.
00:33:01,00:33:03,"Basically, the Greeks kept saying,"
00:33:03,00:33:05,"""These people wear trousers,"
00:33:05,00:33:07,"""they're just too addicted to luxury."""
00:33:07,00:33:09,(audience laughing)
00:33:09,00:33:11,"Genuinely, that was an example that is..."
00:33:11,00:33:13,Their kings have parasols.
00:33:13,00:33:15,Embarrassing.
00:33:15,00:33:17,A servant has to shade your king with a little umbrella.
00:33:17,00:33:20,"It's a little bit weak, so there was a lot of that."
00:33:20,00:33:23,"But one of the great things they had in the Persian Empire,"
00:33:23,00:33:27,"post, so as I look at this,"
00:33:27,00:33:28,it's now less exciting than I think it...
00:33:28,00:33:31,(audience laughing)
00:33:31,00:33:33,I think it's just really interesting.
00:33:33,00:33:35,They have an amazing postal system.
00:33:35,00:33:37,"Sometimes you look down at a note,"
00:33:37,00:33:38,"the confidence just drains,"
00:33:38,00:33:40,like all the blood drains from the face.
00:33:40,00:33:42,(audience laughing)
00:33:42,00:33:44,"- Did they have a morning and afternoon post, Andy?"
00:33:44,00:33:45,(audience laughing)
00:33:45,00:33:47,"James, they had so many posts."
00:33:47,00:33:49,"Honestly, they make the current post office look"
00:33:49,00:33:50,absolute dog shit.
00:33:50,00:33:51,They were just...
00:33:51,00:33:52,(audience laughing)
00:33:52,00:33:55,"Like a huge empire, so you have to get stuff,"
00:33:55,00:33:57,"you know, like thousands of kilometers."
00:33:57,00:33:58,"- Yeah, so it went basically all the way to the Balkans,"
00:33:58,00:34:00,"like where Albania is today,"
00:34:00,00:34:02,all the way to the edge of where Iran is today.
00:34:02,00:34:03,So it's absolutely massive.
00:34:03,00:34:05,"- Exactly, and they had this amazing thing called"
00:34:05,00:34:07,"the Royal Road, which was basically only allowed"
00:34:07,00:34:09,for the use of posties and the army.
00:34:09,00:34:11,And to go all the way from Western Iran
00:34:11,00:34:13,"to what is now Western Turkey,"
00:34:13,00:34:14,"a place called Sardis,"
00:34:14,00:34:15,"two and a half thousand kilometers,"
00:34:15,00:34:17,"on foot it would take three months,"
00:34:17,00:34:18,they could get posted in a week.
00:34:18,00:34:20,"- Right, so amazing. - So that genuinely"
00:34:20,00:34:22,"was amazing, and it was the fastest land travel system"
00:34:22,00:34:24,"in the world at the time,"
00:34:24,00:34:26,"'cause it relied on very, very fast horse relays."
00:34:26,00:34:28,"You would just ride a horse for, you know,"
00:34:28,00:34:30,"as long as it could go, and as soon as it stopped,"
00:34:30,00:34:32,another horseman would take the post and go on.
00:34:32,00:34:35,"- Yes, and the stations were set up for that, weren't they?"
00:34:35,00:34:37,"So Cyrus, when he set up the post stations,"
00:34:37,00:34:38,worked out exactly how long the horse
00:34:38,00:34:41,"can go at full speed before it just collapses,"
00:34:41,00:34:42,"and then where the horse is fainted,"
00:34:42,00:34:44,he builds a little post office.
00:34:44,00:34:45,"- Lovely man. - And then he's like,"
00:34:45,00:34:48,"""Leave the next horse here, a nice guy."""
00:34:48,00:34:50,- I should just explain the fact.
00:34:50,00:34:51,- Oh yeah. - That he started with.
00:34:51,00:34:52,"- Oh yeah. - This doctor,"
00:34:52,00:34:54,who was allowed to invade Greece.
00:34:54,00:34:56,"So he was called Demosides,"
00:34:56,00:34:59,"and he'd been previously taken as a slave in a raid,"
00:34:59,00:35:02,and he'd found himself in this Achaemenid empire.
00:35:02,00:35:07,"And Darius the Great, who was a tosser's husband,"
00:35:07,00:35:10,"he had broken his ankle, right?"
00:35:10,00:35:11,"He'd fallen off his horse,"
00:35:11,00:35:13,and really actually dislocated his ankle.
00:35:13,00:35:16,"And all of his doctors tried to help him,"
00:35:16,00:35:17,and the way they tried to help him
00:35:17,00:35:20,"was basically yanking him around,"
00:35:20,00:35:21,"and pulling him up and down,"
00:35:21,00:35:23,and hopefully it would get back in place.
00:35:23,00:35:25,- Right. - And he absolutely hated it.
00:35:25,00:35:27,"He was unable to sleep, he was in so much pain."
00:35:27,00:35:29,"But he found this guy, Demosides,"
00:35:29,00:35:31,"who had been taken as a slave,"
00:35:31,00:35:33,and this guy was a doctor.
00:35:33,00:35:36,"And Demosides made his leg better,"
00:35:36,00:35:40,"and to say thank you,"
00:35:40,00:35:43,he gave him two sets of golden shackles.
00:35:43,00:35:45,"So he was basically saying,"
00:35:45,00:35:48,"""You're still enslaved, but at least you've got gold now."""
00:35:48,00:35:49,"- Nice. - Oh, wow."
00:35:49,00:35:54,"- Anyway, so then Demosides becomes very popular."
00:35:54,00:35:57,A tosser gets his boil on her breast.
00:35:57,00:36:00,"We think now it's mastitis because he managed to cure her,"
00:36:00,00:36:02,"and he wouldn't be able to do any surgery,"
00:36:02,00:36:03,"and she lived quite a long age,"
00:36:03,00:36:05,so we think it probably was mastitis.
00:36:05,00:36:08,"He manages to cure her, and he says,"
00:36:08,00:36:11,"""I will only cure you if you give me anything in return."""
00:36:11,00:36:12,"She says, ""Fine."""
00:36:12,00:36:16,"He says, ""Well, let me go to Greece as part of a raid."""
00:36:16,00:36:18,"And then when he gets to Greece, he escapes,"
00:36:18,00:36:19,because that's where he was from originally
00:36:19,00:36:21,"when he was enslaved. - Oh, yeah."
00:36:21,00:36:22,- So that's kind of the story.
00:36:22,00:36:25,"- And he goes back to Croton, which is where he was from,"
00:36:25,00:36:27,and he marries the daughter
00:36:27,00:36:30,of a really famous wrestler called Milo.
00:36:30,00:36:33,And this guy is extraordinary.
00:36:33,00:36:34,Have we spoken about him before?
00:36:34,00:36:35,- I don't think so. - I don't think we have.
00:36:35,00:36:40,"He was an Olympian. He won six Olympic events in his time,"
00:36:40,00:36:43,"and he was just one of those guys who was so big and massive,"
00:36:43,00:36:45,"he could do feets of strength that almost seemed impossible,"
00:36:45,00:36:49,so he could hold out his arm with his fingers outstretched
00:36:49,00:36:53,"and challenge people to attempt to bend his little finger,"
00:36:53,00:36:54,and they couldn't do it.
00:36:54,00:36:56,"They would be trying, and he'd be going, ""Wah!"""
00:36:56,00:36:59,He would stand on a greased iron disc
00:36:59,00:37:01,and challenge people to push him off it.
00:37:01,00:37:03,They never could.
00:37:03,00:37:05,He could hold a pomegranate in one hand
00:37:05,00:37:07,and challenge others to take it from him.
00:37:07,00:37:08,Nobody could.
00:37:08,00:37:11,"And despite holding it very tightly, it was never damaged."
00:37:11,00:37:13,This guy is incredible.
00:37:13,00:37:15,"And in his off years, he was trained by carrying"
00:37:15,00:37:18,a newborn calf on his back every day
00:37:18,00:37:19,"until the Olympics took place,"
00:37:19,00:37:23,"by which time he was carrying a four-year-old cow on his back,"
00:37:23,00:37:27,and he would carry it the length of the stadium
00:37:27,00:37:30,"and then kill it, roast it, and eat it as part of like,"
00:37:30,00:37:33,"an intimate, like doing the hacker that the New Zealanders do."
00:37:33,00:37:34,It was like his intimidation process.
00:37:34,00:37:36,What a life for that cow.
00:37:36,00:37:37,What the hell?
00:37:37,00:37:38,Incredible.
00:37:38,00:37:39,Four years on someone's shoulders and then killed.
00:37:39,00:37:40,"Yeah, exactly."
00:37:40,00:37:42,"You'd think you're like best buddies,"
00:37:42,00:37:43,"but then suddenly, yeah."
00:37:43,00:37:45,And so then the legend goes that he died
00:37:45,00:37:48,"when he tried to show one final bit of feeder strength,"
00:37:48,00:37:51,"which was he was passing a man who was chopping a tree,"
00:37:51,00:37:55,"and he said, ""I will rip this trunk in half"
00:37:55,00:37:57,"""with my bare hands."""
00:37:57,00:37:59,"And the guy said, ""Incredible."""
00:37:59,00:38:01,"He said, ""What an honor for you to do that, Milo."""
00:38:01,00:38:05,"And for some reason, the guy then went off while he did it,"
00:38:05,00:38:07,"and as he stretched to separate it,"
00:38:07,00:38:11,"something cracked and his fingers went in and he got stuck,"
00:38:11,00:38:14,and he just died 'cause the guy didn't come back.
00:38:14,00:38:15,"Oh, my gosh."
00:38:15,00:38:17,But he did win the tree-hugging contest
00:38:17,00:38:19,for three years in a row.
00:38:19,00:38:28,"We're gonna move on to our final fact of the show,"
00:38:28,00:38:29,and that is my fact.
00:38:29,00:38:33,My fact this week is that one way to tell how deep you are
00:38:33,00:38:38,when scuba diving is to take a set of snooker balls with you.
00:38:38,00:38:41,Is that 'cause you're at the bottom if you've done that?
00:38:41,00:38:42,You've sunk to the bottom.
00:38:42,00:38:44,Or is it because you're so fat
00:38:44,00:38:46,"once you can't hear the snooker players going,"
00:38:46,00:38:48,"""Where you going with that balls?"""
00:38:48,00:38:49,Then you know you're a certain number.
00:38:49,00:38:50,"No, you're in trouble."
00:38:50,00:38:52,"No, this is a fascinating thing that I didn't know,"
00:38:52,00:38:55,"which is that as you go lower into the ocean,"
00:38:55,00:38:57,different bits of color disappear.
00:38:57,00:39:00,"And so if you had no way of knowing how deep you are,"
00:39:00,00:39:02,"you can consult your snooker balls,"
00:39:02,00:39:06,"and if you can see that your red ball is no longer red,"
00:39:06,00:39:08,"that your yellow ball is no longer yellow,"
00:39:08,00:39:10,"but your green ball is still green,"
00:39:10,00:39:12,then you know that you're roughly where you are in the ocean.
00:39:12,00:39:14,"It is genius, Anna, I must say."
00:39:14,00:39:16,"Fascinating, so this is..."
00:39:16,00:39:18,It's very inconvenient to have to take a set of snooker balls.
00:39:18,00:39:19,"No, no, no, Anna."
00:39:19,00:39:22,"Oh, contraire, because I looked,"
00:39:22,00:39:26,"and the cheapest depth gauge you can get online is £30,"
00:39:26,00:39:29,but the cheapest set of snooker balls is only £15.
00:39:29,00:39:31,There you go. I'll take it back.
00:39:31,00:39:33,"What if you drop one, and then..."
00:39:33,00:39:36,You better hope it's a red one.
00:39:36,00:39:39,"But, like, how will you know what color they are?"
00:39:39,00:39:41,Because you can still see the colors.
00:39:41,00:39:44,"So, okay, so say you're going down, say you're going down."
00:39:44,00:39:46,"At about 20 feet, red stops being red."
00:39:46,00:39:49,"Okay, so you know all the red balls look grey."
00:39:49,00:39:52,"Yes, exactly, so you're like, ""Ah, I must be about 20 feet down."""
00:39:52,00:39:55,"You go down to 50 feet, orange disappears altogether."
00:39:55,00:39:57,"""Oh, I must be at 50 feet."""
00:39:57,00:40:01,"You keep going down. ""Where's yellow gone? I'm 100 feet deep."""
00:40:01,00:40:04,"So the more you go down, color starts disappearing."
00:40:04,00:40:08,"And it's fascinating. So, for example, if you were, let's say,"
00:40:08,00:40:11,"50 feet below the ocean, maybe even 100,"
00:40:11,00:40:15,"and you cut yourself, you would bleed green blood,"
00:40:15,00:40:17,because that color would be morphing towards...
00:40:17,00:40:21,"So, people... I think it's quite, I think it's even just, like, 10 meters."
00:40:21,00:40:23,Because red disappears very fast. Red is a shit color.
00:40:23,00:40:27,It's got no energy. It sees one bit of water and disappears into it.
00:40:27,00:40:29,"And I think on diving websites, it says, like,"
00:40:29,00:40:33,"early scuba divers, if they cut themselves, can get quite shocked,"
00:40:33,00:40:36,"because you're eight meters underwater and you go, ""I'm an alien!"""
00:40:36,00:40:39,But this is the amazing thing.
00:40:39,00:40:43,"This is why so many fish red, because loads of fish are red,"
00:40:43,00:40:45,"and they're doing it in the deep sea, loads of fish are red,"
00:40:45,00:40:49,"and it's for camouflage, because you can't see red at that depth."
00:40:49,00:40:51,"So they look grey or black, all the red light has been absorbed."
00:40:51,00:40:53,They're basically invisible.
00:40:53,00:40:56,But blue is the color that lasts the longest and penetrates the best.
00:40:56,00:40:59,So there are very few animals which have big blue bodies.
00:40:59,00:41:02,The blue whale is basically so confident.
00:41:02,00:41:03,"Like, they're none predators."
00:41:03,00:41:06,"But in the reefs, you get, like, blue and yellow fish, don't you?"
00:41:06,00:41:08,And the reason is that they want to signal where they are
00:41:08,00:41:12,"for sexual reasons or something like that, or scare things away."
00:41:12,00:41:15,And yellow is the complementary color to blue.
00:41:15,00:41:17,So the complementary color to red is green.
00:41:17,00:41:19,They really contrast against each other.
00:41:19,00:41:21,The complementary color to blue is yellow.
00:41:21,00:41:23,So that's why you get lots of blue and yellow fish.
00:41:23,00:41:29,"But also it means if there were traffic lights in the fish world,"
00:41:29,00:41:31,"there would be no use being red and green,"
00:41:31,00:41:33,because the red would disappear straight away.
00:41:33,00:41:36,"They would have to be blue, which is the thing that stands out the most."
00:41:36,00:41:39,"So the red light would be blue,"
00:41:39,00:41:41,"and the green light would be the complementary color to that,"
00:41:41,00:41:43,which would be yellow.
00:41:43,00:41:46,"And if you look at Spongebob Squarepants, they get it wrong."
00:41:46,00:41:49,[LAUGHTER]
00:41:49,00:41:51,"I should quickly say where I got this fact from,"
00:41:51,00:41:54,because I was reading a novel when we were on tour.
00:41:54,00:41:56,"We were in Dublin, and I bought this book on the way over,"
00:41:56,00:41:59,"which was ""Wailfall"" by Daniel Krause."
00:41:59,00:42:04,"It's a science fiction book, so it's all fictional, but this was in it."
00:42:04,00:42:07,"And it's the story of a guy who's going scuba diving,"
00:42:07,00:42:10,and he's accidentally swallowed by a whale.
00:42:10,00:42:13,"And while he's in the whale, he's still got the scuba gear on him,"
00:42:13,00:42:15,"so he makes it into one of the stomachs,"
00:42:15,00:42:17,"and he knows he has an hour of oxygen left,"
00:42:17,00:42:21,and it's the story of how he attempts to get out of the whale within an hour.
00:42:21,00:42:23,It's one of those books. It's like the Martian...
00:42:23,00:42:27,It's proper science trying to work out how to not be digested in a whale stomach.
00:42:27,00:42:30,I learned so much despite it being fiction.
00:42:30,00:42:33,"I know, for example, if you do get swallowed by a whale and you're in its stomach,"
00:42:33,00:42:35,don't try to escape via the anus.
00:42:35,00:42:36,Not going to work for you.
00:42:36,00:42:38,You need to go back out the other way.
00:42:38,00:42:40,"I'm not going to say whether or not he makes it out, but don't do that."
00:42:40,00:42:41,Does he try the anus?
00:42:41,00:42:43,"He does. His initial thought is,"
00:42:43,00:42:45,"""I need to just go all the way out through the end."""
00:42:45,00:42:47,This guy sounds like an idiot.
00:42:47,00:42:48,"Well, I think when you're inside..."
00:42:48,00:42:49,"Wait, what's wrong with that?"
00:42:49,00:42:52,"What, because you get digested by the digestive juices?"
00:42:52,00:42:53,It feels like...
00:42:53,00:42:55,What does he discover as a scientifically incorrect reason?
00:42:55,00:42:58,One thing is that a whale doesn't want to eat you.
00:42:58,00:43:01,It wants you out of it. It's not a nice thing for them.
00:43:01,00:43:05,"You can see inside a whale because largely it swallows bioluminescence,"
00:43:05,00:43:08,"so actually, you can get sight inside a whale."
00:43:08,00:43:09,What you mean it swallows stuff that's bioluminescence?
00:43:09,00:43:13,"Yeah, exactly. So, it might swallow an octopus that has bioluminescence attached to it,"
00:43:13,00:43:15,so you can use that as a torch.
00:43:15,00:43:18,You can use an octopus as a torch inside a stomach.
00:43:18,00:43:20,"Oh, my God, I've lost a snooker ball."
00:43:20,00:43:26,Did you get 90% of animals in the ocean glow in the dark?
00:43:26,00:43:29,"Which makes sense because, as we say, all colours go away,"
00:43:29,00:43:31,so they have to make their own colour.
00:43:31,00:43:35,But 90% have fluorescent colours that show up.
00:43:35,00:43:37,"And as we say, if you don't have fluorescent colours"
00:43:37,00:43:39,"and you want to disguise yourself in your prey,"
00:43:39,00:43:41,then you're often red or black.
00:43:41,00:43:45,"But that becomes a problem if you meet a dragonfish,"
00:43:45,00:43:48,which is the only fish that can actually generate red light.
00:43:48,00:43:52,"So, the dragonfish knows that it's so deep down"
00:43:52,00:43:55,"that red light can't penetrate, so it brings its own."
00:43:55,00:43:58,"And it's got these headlights under its eyes,"
00:43:58,00:44:02,"kind of like wall paint, and they flash red."
00:44:02,00:44:04,"And so, as soon as they land on a fish that's red,"
00:44:04,00:44:08,"that thinks it's completely invisible, it shows up red."
00:44:08,00:44:11,"The only problem is that red doesn't travel very far in water,"
00:44:11,00:44:15,so they have to get literally centimetres away from the prey.
00:44:15,00:44:17,But they basically have a...
00:44:17,00:44:19,They effectively have an invisible torch.
00:44:19,00:44:21,Because nothing else can see the red. Nothing else can see it.
00:44:21,00:44:24,Only they can see what they're trying to do.
00:44:24,00:44:27,"Like one of those blue light things that you get, like UV torches, right?"
00:44:27,00:44:30,Like that. They're very cool.
00:44:30,00:44:32,"But they can't have an eye test,"
00:44:32,00:44:34,"because if you bring them to the surface, they will explode."
00:44:34,00:44:38,LAUGHTER
00:44:38,00:44:40,"Now, if you could just read the first..."
00:44:40,00:44:41,"Oh, what was that?"
00:44:41,00:44:45,That's so funny.
00:44:45,00:44:49,"On sea colour, colour in the sea,"
00:44:49,00:44:51,oceans used to be pink.
00:44:51,00:44:53,"And, in fact, the whole world was pink."
00:44:53,00:44:54,Is that like a bacteria thing?
00:44:54,00:44:57,It is a bacteria thing. Yes.
00:44:57,00:44:59,"Good guess, Dan."
00:44:59,00:45:01,10 points.
00:45:01,00:45:02,I'm the only member of this family that gets marked
00:45:02,00:45:05,when they say something remotely correct.
00:45:05,00:45:07,"Well done, you have a star."
00:45:07,00:45:10,And how many marks are you up to after 10 years?
00:45:10,00:45:13,"This is my first one, but it's a good feeling."
00:45:13,00:45:15,It's improvement.
00:45:15,00:45:17,And this is the revelation quite recently
00:45:17,00:45:19,that the world's oldest colour is pink.
00:45:19,00:45:22,And this is from researchers who found ancient pink pigments
00:45:22,00:45:25,in rocks that were 1.1 billion years old.
00:45:25,00:45:28,And so they were over 500 million years older
00:45:28,00:45:30,than the second oldest known pigment.
00:45:30,00:45:33,And they're fossils of chlorophyll.
00:45:33,00:45:35,"But back in the day, really back in the day then,"
00:45:35,00:45:39,"chlorophyll is now green, that's what makes plants green."
00:45:39,00:45:40,"But back then, it was pink."
00:45:40,00:45:43,And it was this pink produced by ancient bacteria.
00:45:43,00:45:44,And that was all there was.
00:45:44,00:45:46,And that was what the oceans were full of.
00:45:46,00:45:48,And so the whole world was pink.
00:45:48,00:45:51,Barbie's world was 1.1 billion years ago.
00:45:51,00:45:55,"You knew she was old-fashioned, but..."
00:45:55,00:45:57,"Have you guys heard of yum, yum, yellow?"
00:45:57,00:45:58,"Yum, yum, yum, yellow."
00:45:58,00:45:59,"Yum, yum, yellow."
00:45:59,00:46:03,No. Is it the yellow of that mustard yellow
00:46:03,00:46:06,"that is meant to make us think it's delicious, whatever it is?"
00:46:06,00:46:08,"Um, no."
00:46:08,00:46:10,Is it sea-based? Is it sponge-bog?
00:46:10,00:46:12,It's sea-based. Is it a starfish?
00:46:12,00:46:14,It's not. What have I already said about yellow?
00:46:14,00:46:16,The yellow and blue fish on the reefs?
00:46:16,00:46:20,Yes. So yellow is very easy to see under water.
00:46:20,00:46:23,"And there is a theory that if you're wearing yum, yum, yellow"
00:46:23,00:46:24,"when you're scuba diving,"
00:46:24,00:46:26,you're more likely to get eaten by sharks.
00:46:26,00:46:27,Oh!
00:46:27,00:46:30,"And scuba divers will talk about this,"
00:46:30,00:46:32,"and they'll say you should never wear yum, yum, yellow."
00:46:32,00:46:34,It comes from early...
00:46:34,00:46:38,"In the World War II, there was a lot of incidents in the Pacific"
00:46:38,00:46:41,where US Navy people would end up in the water
00:46:41,00:46:43,and they'd get eaten by sharks and stuff like that.
00:46:43,00:46:45,It comes from that originally.
00:46:45,00:46:47,And we're not really sure whether it...
00:46:47,00:46:50,Not it's true that sharks do go for yellow.
00:46:50,00:46:52,Are we saying people aren't willing to test this?
00:46:52,00:46:56,"Well, it seems theoretical that it's true."
00:46:56,00:46:58,"But the international shark attack file said,"
00:46:58,00:47:01,"""The benefit of increasing one's chances of being rescued"
00:47:01,00:47:04,"far outweighs the minimal risk of attracting a shark."""
00:47:04,00:47:07,"So the thing is, if you're yellow, people will be able to see you"
00:47:07,00:47:08,and be able to rescue you.
00:47:08,00:47:11,There was a person called Valerie Taylor who invented a wetsuit
00:47:11,00:47:15,"which had the same markings as sea snakes,"
00:47:15,00:47:18,because grey-white sharks don't like sea snakes.
00:47:18,00:47:20,And the theory was that they would see you
00:47:20,00:47:23,and think you were a snake and then would swim away.
00:47:23,00:47:24,And it's a really good theory.
00:47:24,00:47:26,-The only problem... -She got eaten.
00:47:26,00:47:29,"Well, tiger sharks are keen predators of sea snakes."
00:47:29,00:47:30,"Oh, no!"
00:47:30,00:47:33,"So it does save you from the great wikes,"
00:47:33,00:47:35,but the tigers will still get you.
00:47:35,00:47:37,"Do you know, that's a new thing, sea snakes."
00:47:37,00:47:41,"In 2021, a report was done by a scuba diver"
00:47:41,00:47:43,"who noticed that every time he was going into the water,"
00:47:43,00:47:45,sea snakes were trying to shag him.
00:47:45,00:47:48,And it was because they can't really see.
00:47:48,00:47:49,The only way they can know properly
00:47:49,00:47:52,what they are going to be eating is by tasting it.
00:47:52,00:47:54,So they wrap themselves around the legs
00:47:54,00:47:56,"and the torsos of scuba divers,"
00:47:56,00:47:58,"and they start licking them and then going,"
00:47:58,00:48:01,"""Oh, no, this is not a sea snake."""
00:48:01,00:48:02,But this...
00:48:02,00:48:03,"Wait, do they want to..."
00:48:03,00:48:05,"Are they testing if they want to eat it or shag it, sorry?"
00:48:05,00:48:08,"So it's mating season, and because they can't see,"
00:48:08,00:48:10,"basically in order to know what they're dealing with,"
00:48:10,00:48:11,they need to lick it.
00:48:11,00:48:13,And that's not good.
00:48:13,00:48:16,The other thing with sea snakes is the way of cutting
00:48:16,00:48:19,"is the male will go up and look for a female,"
00:48:19,00:48:21,and then the female will swim away.
00:48:21,00:48:24,And so if you're a diver and the load of sea snakes
00:48:24,00:48:27,"come up to you and you swim off away from them,"
00:48:27,00:48:28,they think you're playing hard to get.
00:48:28,00:48:30,Yeah.
00:48:30,00:48:32,So apparently the best thing to do is just go to the bottom
00:48:32,00:48:35,of the reef and just let them...
00:48:35,00:48:35,Let them go?
00:48:35,00:48:37,Let them have a go.
00:48:37,00:48:37,All right.
00:48:37,00:48:39,And soon they'll realize
00:48:39,00:48:40,that you're not a sea snake and bugger off.
00:48:40,00:48:42,Yeah. Wow.
00:48:42,00:48:45,"There was a study recently of a body of water,"
00:48:45,00:48:47,a body of water that one of us loves more
00:48:47,00:48:49,than any other in the world.
00:48:49,00:48:51,"Oh, gosh, I don't have a favourite"
00:48:51,00:48:52,"body of water, I don't think."
00:48:52,00:48:54,"Dan, you've been there looking for a..."
00:48:54,00:48:55,"Oh, Loch Ness."
00:48:55,00:48:57,"Oh, Loch Ness, right."
00:48:57,00:49:00,"There was a theory that maybe, just maybe,"
00:49:00,00:49:05,"a very, very big eel might be the Loch Ness monster,"
00:49:05,00:49:07,like a six metre long eel.
00:49:07,00:49:08,"Carl Sagan, great scientist,"
00:49:08,00:49:11,"admittedly more of space than of water,"
00:49:11,00:49:13,thought that there could be 310 metre eels living there.
00:49:13,00:49:14,"And if they all teamed up,"
00:49:14,00:49:18,they could look very convincingly like the Loch Ness monster.
00:49:19,00:49:21,"And there was a study, a sort of troll of the DNA in the water,"
00:49:21,00:49:24,and they found huge amounts of eel DNA.
00:49:24,00:49:25,"And so, right, we're on a winner."
00:49:25,00:49:27,"Like, maybe the Loch Ness monster"
00:49:27,00:49:30,is actually just a load of eels.
00:49:30,00:49:32,"But unfortunately, the latest thinking"
00:49:32,00:49:34,is that probably there are not giant eels living there.
00:49:34,00:49:37,"Because the maximum length of a European eel,"
00:49:37,00:49:38,"as I don't need to remind you guys,"
00:49:38,00:49:39,is about 0.9 metres long.
00:49:39,00:49:43,The odds of finding a six metre eel are very slim.
00:49:43,00:49:46,But that just means six ties more of them
00:49:46,00:49:48,"need to get together to pretend to be a Loch Ness monster, right?"
00:49:48,00:49:51,"Yeah, they just need to buy a bigger trenchcoat."
00:49:51,00:49:55,"Yeah, well, so maybe, maybe that's it."
00:49:55,00:49:58,Quite a cool thing related to Dan's original fact
00:49:58,00:50:01,about wavelengths travelling different amounts underwater.
00:50:01,00:50:03,"You know when it's been a hot sunny day,"
00:50:03,00:50:04,"and you think, oh, I'll get in the river"
00:50:04,00:50:05,"because it's a nice hot sunny day,"
00:50:05,00:50:07,"and you put your toe in and it's like,"
00:50:07,00:50:09,"oh, the water's so warm and nice."
00:50:09,00:50:10,"And then you put your full foot in,"
00:50:10,00:50:13,it's fucking freezing underneath that.
00:50:13,00:50:16,"That is because in the electromagnetic spectrum,"
00:50:16,00:50:17,"which you'll remember from school,"
00:50:17,00:50:21,"infrared waves have an even longer wavelength than red,"
00:50:21,00:50:23,and they're the ones that we get heat from.
00:50:23,00:50:25,"And so when they come from the sun,"
00:50:25,00:50:27,the heat lands in the water
00:50:27,00:50:28,and immediately spreads on the surface
00:50:28,00:50:31,and it only gets 10 centimetres down max.
00:50:31,00:50:32,"So that's why, I mean, obviously,"
00:50:32,00:50:34,"then it does mix in a bit because it's liquid,"
00:50:34,00:50:36,but that is why when you put your foot in the water
00:50:36,00:50:37,"and you think, lovely."
00:50:37,00:50:38,Yeah.
00:50:38,00:50:39,"Yeah, then..."
00:50:39,00:50:42,"Interestingly, that's the same with trees, right?"
00:50:42,00:50:42,So if you...
00:50:42,00:50:43,"Oh, here we go."
00:50:43,00:50:45,"God, it all comes back to that, please."
00:50:45,00:50:45,"No, no, it's true."
00:50:45,00:50:49,"If you hug, wrap your arms around the lower trunk of daddy"
00:50:49,00:50:51,and you're going to have a colder experience.
00:50:51,00:50:53,"So they found this out with koalas, basically."
00:50:53,00:50:55,"It's a very similar thing,"
00:50:55,00:50:57,"which is that koalas, when it gets really hot,"
00:50:57,00:51:00,they travel down a tree and they hug a tree much lower
00:51:00,00:51:04,and they did scans on the tree to see the heat signals.
00:51:04,00:51:06,"On a lower bit of a tree, it's always colder."
00:51:06,00:51:08,So they're regulating themselves
00:51:08,00:51:10,because they don't sweat koalas.
00:51:10,00:51:13,They have to sort of lick out the wetness out of them.
00:51:15,00:51:17,They lick themselves and they're not evaporated
00:51:17,00:51:18,and takes away the heat.
00:51:18,00:51:21,"I mean, that's a different way of saying it."
00:51:21,00:51:25,They don't have to suck their own sweat out.
00:51:25,00:51:29,But this thing actually about the koalas is interesting
00:51:29,00:51:31,"because that study was done a few years ago, right?"
00:51:31,00:51:32,And they wondered if anyone else did it
00:51:32,00:51:34,and they found that there's a type of lima
00:51:34,00:51:36,called the white sifaka.
00:51:36,00:51:40,And they do the same thing in Madagascar.
00:51:40,00:51:41,"And the amazing thing about that,"
00:51:41,00:51:44,they hug the trees because they want to get cool.
00:51:45,00:51:46,"Because the water comes up from below,"
00:51:46,00:51:48,"it's a little bit cooler, it can keep them cool."
00:51:48,00:51:51,And what they found out is that they never do it
00:51:51,00:51:54,until the temperature gets to 30 degrees.
00:51:54,00:51:56,"And then for each one degree increase,"
00:51:56,00:51:59,it doubles the chances of the limas going there.
00:51:59,00:52:01,So it means that if you're in Madagascar
00:52:01,00:52:03,"and you don't have a thermometer with you,"
00:52:03,00:52:06,all you have to do is count the number of limas
00:52:06,00:52:07,who are around the trunk.
00:52:07,00:52:09,And that'll tell you what the temperature is.
00:52:09,00:52:09,That's incredible.
00:52:09,00:52:11,That's amazing.
00:52:11,00:52:12,"Guys, we're going to have to wrap up."
00:52:12,00:52:14,That's so good.
00:52:14,00:52:16,And do you know what kind of TV dolphins like?
00:52:16,00:52:19,"Well, we're talking about seeing things underwater."
00:52:19,00:52:20,It won't be flipper-eyed.
00:52:20,00:52:22,It won't be stuff that they're in.
00:52:22,00:52:26,"Well, I don't really like to watch things that I'm in."
00:52:26,00:52:30,What do dolphins like?
00:52:30,00:52:32,They love fish to eat fish.
00:52:32,00:52:33,Reality stuff.
00:52:33,00:52:34,Reality shows.
00:52:34,00:52:34,Yeah.
00:52:34,00:52:38,"Well, some scientists showed some bottle noses,"
00:52:38,00:52:41,Planet Earth and SpongeBob SquarePants.
00:52:41,00:52:46,And tried to see whether they prefer real life underwater scenes
00:52:46,00:52:49,or ones where they stupidly get the traffic lights wrong.
00:52:49,00:52:53,And it turns out that actually dolphins are interested
00:52:53,00:52:55,in all TV shows no matter what is on.
00:52:55,00:52:57,I knew they were stupid.
00:52:57,00:53:01,Although male dolphins slightly preferred
00:53:01,00:53:03,to watch videos of female dolphins.
00:53:03,00:53:05,OK.
00:53:05,00:53:09,"Just like your average British man at the end of any day, really."
00:53:09,00:53:10,I'll watch anything.
00:53:10,00:53:13,Mildly prefer it if there's a female in it.
00:53:13,00:53:13,Good on him.
00:53:13,00:53:17,Lovely thought to end on.
00:53:17,00:53:19,I've got that right.
00:53:19,00:53:20,That makes you think.
00:53:20,00:53:24,"Meanwhile, Dan's watching Forestry Live 24 hours a day."
00:53:24,00:53:32,"OK, everyone."
00:53:32,00:53:32,That is it.
00:53:32,00:53:33,That is our facts.
