00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580
 (upbeat music)

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:14.860
 - Hello and welcome to another episode

00:00:14.860 --> 00:00:16.660
 of No Such Thing as a Fish,

00:00:16.660 --> 00:00:20.780
 a weekly podcast this week coming to you live from Cardiff.

00:00:20.780 --> 00:00:23.500
 (audience cheering)

00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:25.300
 My name is Dan Schreiber.

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:28.540
 I am sitting here with Anna Tyshinski, Andrew Hunter Murray

00:00:28.540 --> 00:00:29.740
 and James Harkin.

00:00:29.740 --> 00:00:32.180
 And once again, we have gathered round the microphones

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:35.060
 with our four favorite facts from the last seven days

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:38.180
 and in no particular order, here we go.

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:41.700
 Starting with fact number one, that is Andy.

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:44.860
 - My fact is that the Glasgow Tree Hugging Competition

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:46.660
 contains three rounds.

00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:51.660
 Speed Hugging, Dedicated Hugging and Freestyle Hugging.

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:53.740
 (audience laughing)

00:00:53.740 --> 00:00:55.300
 - Wow. - Yeah.

00:00:55.300 --> 00:00:57.100
 - Freestyle. - Freestyle.

00:00:57.100 --> 00:00:58.020
 - What is freestyle?

00:00:58.020 --> 00:00:59.780
 It still has to be a tree, does it?

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:00.940
 - It all has to be a tree,

00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:03.660
 but freestyle is by a long way the most erotic.

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:04.500
 (audience laughing)

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:06.420
 - Well, I think we're witnessing freestyle

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:07.380
 in the background here.

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:09.020
 There's an image that we put up on the screens

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:09.860
 at our live show.

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:11.780
 The person up there is Hannah Willow,

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:13.620
 who is the winner of this year's--

00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:14.980
 - Hannah Willow? - Yeah.

00:01:14.980 --> 00:01:16.940
 - Did she marry the tree that she hugged?

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:17.780
 (audience laughing)

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:18.780
 It looks like it.

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:20.540
 - They should be married, considering--

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:21.860
 - Oh, really? - Considering the--

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:23.540
 - I was gonna say, Andy, for some of us,

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:25.940
 an erotic hug is also the speed hug.

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:28.940
 (audience laughing)

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:32.140
 You have to hug as many trees as possible in one minute.

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:33.700
 So that is both speedy.

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:35.380
 - Do you know the number?

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:37.380
 - I actually don't know what Hannah scored on that,

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:38.860
 but the hugs have to last five seconds each,

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:40.140
 so it's just--

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:41.420
 - Do you know what the world record

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:44.340
 for most trees hugged in an hour is?

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:45.260
 - No. - Ooh.

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:47.100
 - Can you have a guess?

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:48.220
 - What country?

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:49.700
 - Ghana, what? - How will--

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:50.700
 Sorry, then.

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:51.940
 (audience laughing)

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:52.940
 And how are you factoring that

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:55.340
 into your matrix of calculations?

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:58.100
 - So Ghana, dense forest, trees are close to each other.

00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:00.580
 - Point, but equatorial, saps the energy.

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:01.420
 (audience laughing)

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:02.260
 - Damn.

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:04.540
 - I think in Ghana, you probably know this, Dan,

00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:07.380
 but they've done a lot of tree planting in recent years,

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:09.580
 so they got quite a lot of smaller trees.

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:10.420
 - Oh.

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:11.260
 - But that's good.

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:12.100
 That means you can get between them faster.

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:12.940
 - Exactly.

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:14.060
 I think that's what Dan's asking.

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:14.900
 - Yeah.

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:15.740
 - Okay.

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:16.740
 How many seconds are there in an hour, James?

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:18.740
 - There are about 3,600.

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:22.180
 - I'll say 3,600, one per second.

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:23.020
 - One per second.

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:25.860
 You have to, someone's not bringing the tree to you,

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:26.700
 so you can hug it.

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:28.340
 You have to go from one tree to another.

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:29.580
 - Are you allowed to hug the same?

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:31.700
 Can you just go from one tree and back again and again

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:33.020
 and again, or does that have to be a different tree each time?

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:33.860
 - Every tree different.

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:34.700
 - Every tree different.

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:35.540
 - What if you run up a tree?

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:36.380
 What if you hug so many,

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:37.620
 and no more trees left in Ghana?

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:38.460
 (laughing)

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:40.180
 - The number is lower than the total number

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:41.020
 of trees in Ghana.

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:41.860
 (audience laughing)

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:42.700
 - Okay, but the other way--

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:44.780
 - Does the five second rule apply to each hug?

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:45.860
 - No, it doesn't.

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:46.700
 - What's that?

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:47.940
 If you can still eat it

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:50.260
 as long as you have to drop the tree for five seconds?

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:52.860
 - The tree falls over in the forest, but no one notices,

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:54.460
 and you quickly put it on your plate and it's fine.

00:02:54.460 --> 00:02:55.300
 - Yeah.

00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:56.700
 No, in this tree hugging,

00:02:56.700 --> 00:02:58.860
 you need to hug for five seconds per tree.

00:02:58.860 --> 00:02:59.700
 - No, this one is--

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:01.820
 - Okay, so I'm gonna say 400.

00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:02.660
 - 100?

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:03.500
 Any advance?

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:05.580
 - I think about a grand, about a thousand.

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:06.740
 - About a thousand.

00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:08.260
 Anna is correct.

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:09.100
 - What?

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:11.900
 - Almost, it's 1,123,

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:14.940
 which is on average one every 3.2 seconds.

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:15.780
 - Wow, decent.

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:16.620
 - That's really good.

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:17.460
 - That's pretty good.

00:03:17.460 --> 00:03:20.940
 Abu Bakar Tahiru did it this year.

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:21.780
 - Nice.

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:24.020
 - But Hannah Willow, previously mentioned,

00:03:24.020 --> 00:03:25.820
 I think where she excelled

00:03:25.820 --> 00:03:27.900
 in these three elements you mentioned, Andy,

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:29.300
 is the dedication.

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:33.060
 And that is where you show devotion, passion, and loyalty.

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:36.260
 So, that's where she won the competition.

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:38.500
 - And that's a single tree, isn't it?

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:39.580
 - Yes, that's a single tree.

00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:41.260
 - And it's interesting, I think freestyle,

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:42.820
 that round is also a single tree.

00:03:42.820 --> 00:03:45.780
 So you have to show something other than an embrace.

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:46.900
 So it's not actually a hug at all.

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:50.580
 It's, you might play it a song, you might...

00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:51.660
 - Oh, great.

00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:53.860
 - She did a dance, that was her big thing.

00:03:53.860 --> 00:03:56.500
 Yeah, she didn't know that that was required of her.

00:03:56.500 --> 00:03:58.180
 So she just had to improvise a dance.

00:03:58.180 --> 00:04:00.660
 But she is someone who goes out and does forest bathing.

00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:03.620
 She spends a lot of time getting in touch with nature.

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:05.500
 - Can we talk about what forest bathing is?

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:06.860
 'Cause I read that as well and I liked that.

00:04:06.860 --> 00:04:07.820
 - Yeah, what is that?

00:04:07.820 --> 00:04:10.100
 - Well, it's when you go out to the forest

00:04:10.100 --> 00:04:12.020
 and you just bathe, right?

00:04:12.020 --> 00:04:16.020
 You're like, you just take in the smells

00:04:16.020 --> 00:04:17.740
 and the air and the, it's just going out.

00:04:17.740 --> 00:04:18.740
 It's like a nice wall.

00:04:18.740 --> 00:04:21.460
 - So what I assumed is correct that it is another way

00:04:21.460 --> 00:04:24.140
 of saying she likes to go for a walk in the woods.

00:04:24.140 --> 00:04:28.060
 - Yeah, does she have to take her clothes off like a bath?

00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:28.900
 - No.

00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:29.740
 - Okay.

00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:30.580
 - You don't have to take your clothes off in the bath.

00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:31.900
 Fun fact, I don't.

00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:34.020
 (laughing)

00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:36.020
 - You never take your socks off in any situation.

00:04:36.020 --> 00:04:37.740
 - Absolutely not.

00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:39.900
 - Even the erotic freestyle.

00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:42.260
 - It makes it more erotic if the socks are still on.

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:43.340
 - But it's really cool.

00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:45.300
 She's, so she's a mum of three

00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:47.140
 and she was asked like,

00:04:47.140 --> 00:04:49.940
 are they excited that mum is the tree hugging champion?

00:04:49.940 --> 00:04:51.900
 And they said, no, they were hugely embarrassed

00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:54.460
 to find out I was tree hugging champion.

00:04:54.460 --> 00:04:56.900
 Yeah, I've slightly ruined their street cred

00:04:56.900 --> 00:04:57.740
 is what she said.

00:04:57.740 --> 00:04:59.420
 But she's going to ruin it even more

00:04:59.420 --> 00:05:01.940
 because it's not just about winning the Glaswegian

00:05:01.940 --> 00:05:03.060
 tree hugging competition.

00:05:03.060 --> 00:05:07.260
 She now, by winning that qualifies to represent Glasgow

00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:09.500
 in the international tree hugging competition

00:05:09.500 --> 00:05:11.100
 that happens in Finland.

00:05:11.100 --> 00:05:13.120
 It's like a giant global competition

00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:15.980
 where all our best huggers go and meet in Finland

00:05:15.980 --> 00:05:16.820
 for an ultimate hug.

00:05:16.820 --> 00:05:19.300
 - That's gonna be tough for the favourites from Ghana,

00:05:19.300 --> 00:05:20.140
 isn't it?

00:05:20.140 --> 00:05:21.940
 Going all the way up to Finland and that cold weather.

00:05:21.940 --> 00:05:22.780
 - Yes.

00:05:22.780 --> 00:05:23.620
 - It's gonna be really tough.

00:05:23.620 --> 00:05:24.460
 - It is advantage.

00:05:24.460 --> 00:05:26.820
 - And the taller trees, they won't know what to do, right?

00:05:26.820 --> 00:05:27.660
 - Yeah.

00:05:27.660 --> 00:05:31.260
 I assume you only took the bottom of the trees, right?

00:05:31.260 --> 00:05:33.220
 - Yeah, there's no rule about whether you have to hug

00:05:33.220 --> 00:05:34.060
 base or tip.

00:05:34.060 --> 00:05:34.900
 It's just not.

00:05:34.900 --> 00:05:37.740
 - Go on.

00:05:37.740 --> 00:05:39.060
 - Guard it.

00:05:39.060 --> 00:05:41.900
 But no, it is, it's a really, it's quite fun.

00:05:41.900 --> 00:05:43.080
 I mean, I was quite skeptical about it.

00:05:43.080 --> 00:05:45.160
 I think it was a bit silly, but the Finnish one,

00:05:45.160 --> 00:05:47.960
 which is in a place called Halibu, I think,

00:05:47.960 --> 00:05:50.000
 it was designed this competition by the family

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:53.520
 of a lumberjack who realised he'd been growing

00:05:53.520 --> 00:05:57.000
 all these trees and he loved them too much to cut them down.

00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:59.600
 And he was like a shepherd who just can't bear

00:05:59.600 --> 00:06:00.640
 going to the abattoir.

00:06:00.640 --> 00:06:03.120
 So he and his family thought of this programme

00:06:03.120 --> 00:06:05.160
 where people adopt trees and they've been trying--

00:06:05.160 --> 00:06:07.360
 - Is that not just a lazy lumberjack?

00:06:07.360 --> 00:06:08.200
 - Well.

00:06:08.200 --> 00:06:10.320
 - Who says, oh yeah, sorry, I didn't chop any down today

00:06:10.320 --> 00:06:12.580
 because I love them too much.

00:06:12.580 --> 00:06:14.740
 - You're right, letting someone hug your trees

00:06:14.740 --> 00:06:17.480
 is a much skin off your nose, is it?

00:06:17.480 --> 00:06:19.820
 - But this has become a big thing since COVID.

00:06:19.820 --> 00:06:22.860
 And I remember when we were playing on a previous tour,

00:06:22.860 --> 00:06:24.740
 we were playing Richmond in London

00:06:24.740 --> 00:06:26.420
 and I went to Kew Gardens beforehand

00:06:26.420 --> 00:06:30.340
 and I saw a lady go up and give a massive hug to a tree.

00:06:30.340 --> 00:06:32.420
 And it looks so nice.

00:06:32.420 --> 00:06:34.420
 It looks so, 'cause like we'd all been stuck

00:06:34.420 --> 00:06:37.140
 and she was allowed to connect back with nature again.

00:06:37.140 --> 00:06:38.820
 And I just, it was a bit pervy.

00:06:38.820 --> 00:06:40.540
 I just watched them hug for ages.

00:06:40.540 --> 00:06:43.280
 - What were you doing while you were watching?

00:06:43.280 --> 00:06:45.160
 'Cause if it was just watching, I think it's fine.

00:06:45.160 --> 00:06:46.400
 - I think the rule is if you're in a bush,

00:06:46.400 --> 00:06:47.240
 it's not all right.

00:06:47.240 --> 00:06:49.560
 If you're just in the open, it's fine.

00:06:49.560 --> 00:06:50.560
 - Unless you're hugging the bush.

00:06:50.560 --> 00:06:51.600
 - You might be bush bathing.

00:06:51.600 --> 00:06:52.640
 That's the thing, though, yeah.

00:06:52.640 --> 00:06:54.920
 - Yeah, I was just watching.

00:06:54.920 --> 00:06:56.560
 I didn't, yeah, I just watched.

00:06:56.560 --> 00:06:58.560
 - There is evidence that if you--

00:06:58.560 --> 00:07:00.280
 - I just watched.

00:07:00.280 --> 00:07:03.960
 Don't keep saying it, but I only watched, guys.

00:07:03.960 --> 00:07:06.240
 - There is evidence that you can lower your blood pressure

00:07:06.240 --> 00:07:07.340
 by touching wood.

00:07:07.820 --> 00:07:08.940
 (audience laughs)

00:07:08.940 --> 00:07:10.900
 - Andy said, "Grow up, guys, come on."

00:07:10.900 --> 00:07:14.700
 Different types of wood, depending on the texture

00:07:14.700 --> 00:07:16.500
 of the wood, it can have a different effect.

00:07:16.500 --> 00:07:18.180
 - So not the splintery ones?

00:07:18.180 --> 00:07:20.100
 - Not the splintery ones.

00:07:20.100 --> 00:07:22.500
 - Is that in the form of a tree, or is it just any wood?

00:07:22.500 --> 00:07:23.900
 - It actually works with any wood.

00:07:23.900 --> 00:07:24.740
 - Really?

00:07:24.740 --> 00:07:26.540
 - Yeah, yeah, they did it where they compared people

00:07:26.540 --> 00:07:29.220
 putting their hand on plastic, on metal,

00:07:29.220 --> 00:07:31.140
 and then on wood and their blood pressure went down.

00:07:31.140 --> 00:07:32.260
 - Really?

00:07:32.260 --> 00:07:35.420
 - Oh, well, I hugged a tree in preparation for this fact.

00:07:35.420 --> 00:07:36.260
 - Did you?

00:07:36.260 --> 00:07:38.220
 - Your research is always below par down,

00:07:38.220 --> 00:07:39.660
 but this is reaching new depths.

00:07:39.660 --> 00:07:41.740
 - No, but it is really nice.

00:07:41.740 --> 00:07:43.540
 I've got to say, it was a genuinely nice experience,

00:07:43.540 --> 00:07:45.940
 and a lot of people have been getting back in contact

00:07:45.940 --> 00:07:46.940
 with nature in that kind of way.

00:07:46.940 --> 00:07:48.140
 Again, since the pandemic,

00:07:48.140 --> 00:07:49.500
 and there's been reports all over the world,

00:07:49.500 --> 00:07:51.380
 so in New Zealand, there's great trees

00:07:51.380 --> 00:07:54.460
 that the curators keep busting people, hugging.

00:07:54.460 --> 00:07:56.180
 He's like, "I kind of get it, though.

00:07:56.180 --> 00:07:58.340
 "This tree has ribbons of flaky brown bark,

00:07:58.340 --> 00:08:00.940
 "almost begs to be peeled like a banana."

00:08:00.940 --> 00:08:04.460
 And he talks about great trees to hug,

00:08:04.460 --> 00:08:08.740
 like the long leaf pine, the spongy bark that it has.

00:08:08.740 --> 00:08:10.740
 It practically hugs back, you know?

00:08:10.740 --> 00:08:11.580
 - Oh.

00:08:11.580 --> 00:08:15.100
 - I can see, I can see, but I did only watch.

00:08:15.100 --> 00:08:16.420
 (audience laughs)

00:08:16.420 --> 00:08:18.300
 - And what kind of tree did you hug?

00:08:18.300 --> 00:08:20.100
 - It's a tree that's in my garden.

00:08:20.100 --> 00:08:21.940
 - But did you even find out its name?

00:08:21.940 --> 00:08:24.140
 (audience laughs)

00:08:24.140 --> 00:08:25.500
 - Okay, this is a bit embarrassing,

00:08:25.500 --> 00:08:26.860
 'cause there's five trees.

00:08:26.860 --> 00:08:28.660
 We named them after each member of our family,

00:08:28.660 --> 00:08:30.620
 so I hugged, I hugged Daddy.

00:08:30.620 --> 00:08:33.460
 (audience laughs)

00:08:34.060 --> 00:08:36.940
 (audience laughs)

00:08:36.940 --> 00:08:39.020
 - I don't wanna rain on this tree-hugging parade,

00:08:39.020 --> 00:08:42.300
 but something smells bad about it,

00:08:42.300 --> 00:08:45.500
 and it's this, that, so it's organized,

00:08:45.500 --> 00:08:48.100
 the Glasgow Tree Hugging Competition by Vicky Dale.

00:08:48.100 --> 00:08:51.660
 The children's prize was won by Lottie,

00:08:51.660 --> 00:08:53.940
 who is Dale's daughter.

00:08:53.940 --> 00:08:55.340
 And-- - What?

00:08:55.340 --> 00:08:57.260
 - The children's speed-hugging race

00:08:57.260 --> 00:08:59.860
 won by Freddie, Dale's son.

00:08:59.860 --> 00:09:00.700
 - Oh, dear.

00:09:00.700 --> 00:09:01.900
 - What's going on there, guys?

00:09:01.900 --> 00:09:04.260
 There were only 15 entrants in this whole contest,

00:09:04.260 --> 00:09:06.820
 by the way, which, the Guardian write-up

00:09:06.820 --> 00:09:08.860
 of Hannah Willow-winning was saying,

00:09:08.860 --> 00:09:11.020
 "Willow has savored the rush of victory before,

00:09:11.020 --> 00:09:12.500
 "but only on a minor scale."

00:09:12.500 --> 00:09:13.740
 (audience laughs)

00:09:13.740 --> 00:09:16.740
 How major is this 15-entern competition?

00:09:16.740 --> 00:09:18.340
 - She's super cool, though, by the way.

00:09:18.340 --> 00:09:20.340
 If you, I've gone onto her Instagram,

00:09:20.340 --> 00:09:21.860
 'cause I was trying to get in contact with her

00:09:21.860 --> 00:09:23.380
 to ask her questions for this.

00:09:23.380 --> 00:09:26.540
 - Would you be willing for me to watch out of the open?

00:09:26.540 --> 00:09:28.180
 (audience laughs)

00:09:28.180 --> 00:09:29.980
 - You're sincerely a daddy.

00:09:29.980 --> 00:09:32.820
 (audience laughs)

00:09:32.820 --> 00:09:36.140
 - Well, while we're on that subject,

00:09:36.140 --> 00:09:38.900
 there is a thing called, what is it, dendrophilia,

00:09:38.900 --> 00:09:41.820
 which is basically the sexualization of trees.

00:09:41.820 --> 00:09:43.100
 I mean, that is a real thing.

00:09:43.100 --> 00:09:47.540
 - I saw a news article of a man in Wiltshire in 2023,

00:09:47.540 --> 00:09:51.580
 who was arrested after apparently having sex with a tree,

00:09:51.580 --> 00:09:52.860
 so said the headline.

00:09:52.860 --> 00:09:55.260
 One witness said, "I was just walking in the park

00:09:55.260 --> 00:09:57.740
 "with one of my mates, and we saw a man hugging a tree,

00:09:57.740 --> 00:09:59.340
 "and thought it was interesting.

00:09:59.340 --> 00:10:00.900
 "We walked closer, and as we did,

00:10:00.900 --> 00:10:05.060
 "we saw his trousers down, and thought, 'This is pure gold.'"

00:10:05.060 --> 00:10:08.380
 (audience laughs)

00:10:08.380 --> 00:10:10.300
 - After I stopped recording,

00:10:10.300 --> 00:10:13.060
 (audience laughs)

00:10:13.060 --> 00:10:15.220
 the police turned up and arrested him.

00:10:15.220 --> 00:10:18.620
 - Wow, good grief.

00:10:18.620 --> 00:10:20.100
 Celebrity tree huggers?

00:10:20.100 --> 00:10:21.220
 - Oh, yeah. - Oh, yeah.

00:10:21.220 --> 00:10:24.220
 - So Prince Charles, as we know.

00:10:24.220 --> 00:10:25.300
 - Yeah, he talks to them.

00:10:25.300 --> 00:10:27.980
 - He, yeah, King Charles, I know.

00:10:27.980 --> 00:10:30.260
 He claims he shakes hands with every tree he's planted

00:10:30.260 --> 00:10:31.220
 and wishes them well.

00:10:31.220 --> 00:10:32.380
 - What is a tree is--

00:10:32.380 --> 00:10:34.220
 - Well, a leaf, a branch.

00:10:34.220 --> 00:10:36.700
 - I would say a leaf is a finger, yeah, a branch is an arm.

00:10:36.700 --> 00:10:37.860
 - No, he tends to do leaves,

00:10:37.860 --> 00:10:39.940
 so it's usually a tree planting ceremony,

00:10:39.940 --> 00:10:42.500
 and he'll shake a leaf and say, "Oh, have a good time."

00:10:42.500 --> 00:10:43.820
 And walk off, it's sort of--

00:10:43.820 --> 00:10:45.140
 - But you have to shake so many leaves.

00:10:45.140 --> 00:10:47.140
 You don't want to do it like a full hug for everyone.

00:10:47.140 --> 00:10:49.020
 - Yeah, sure. - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:10:49.020 --> 00:10:50.540
 Novak Djokovic?

00:10:50.540 --> 00:10:52.180
 - Yeah. - Again, not that surprising.

00:10:52.180 --> 00:10:54.300
 - Tree hugger? - Yeah.

00:10:54.300 --> 00:10:55.300
 - When he does the Australian Open,

00:10:55.300 --> 00:10:57.060
 he goes to the Melbourne Botanical Gardens,

00:10:57.060 --> 00:10:58.860
 and he gets some tree-hugging time in.

00:10:58.860 --> 00:10:59.700
 - Does he? - Does he.

00:10:59.700 --> 00:11:00.540
 - Does he? - Yeah.

00:11:00.540 --> 00:11:01.540
 - Is that 'cause he kisses the grass as well, doesn't he?

00:11:01.540 --> 00:11:03.300
 I know he tastes the grass at Wimbledon.

00:11:03.300 --> 00:11:04.660
 - Yeah, he eats. - Eats it.

00:11:04.660 --> 00:11:06.580
 - Yeah, right? - Yeah, must be related.

00:11:06.580 --> 00:11:07.780
 - Yeah. - Tree-hugging,

00:11:07.780 --> 00:11:11.740
 tree-huggers used to be squirrel killers.

00:11:11.740 --> 00:11:15.060
 I was looking for the first references to tree-hugger,

00:11:15.060 --> 00:11:17.660
 and a lot of people say that it came from the '70s,

00:11:17.660 --> 00:11:19.340
 but the OED says first reference

00:11:19.340 --> 00:11:21.540
 to someone being a tree-hugger in a hippie,

00:11:21.540 --> 00:11:23.140
 please stop building this motorway here

00:11:23.140 --> 00:11:25.220
 because it involves felling trees way.

00:11:25.220 --> 00:11:30.220
 It's 1965, and so there are a few people in Appleton,

00:11:30.220 --> 00:11:32.300
 fittingly, Wisconsin, who were named that

00:11:32.300 --> 00:11:33.620
 'cause Apple is a kind of tree.

00:11:33.620 --> 00:11:35.780
 (laughing)

00:11:35.780 --> 00:11:38.620
 But at the same time, in 1965, in Indiana,

00:11:38.620 --> 00:11:41.100
 they were using tree-hugger to describe squirrel hunters,

00:11:41.100 --> 00:11:44.140
 and it was because they basically hide behind a tree

00:11:44.140 --> 00:11:45.140
 that's thicker than them,

00:11:45.140 --> 00:11:47.180
 a tree whose girth is larger than them,

00:11:47.180 --> 00:11:49.420
 watching squirrels, and then dart to another tree

00:11:49.420 --> 00:11:53.500
 and hug that tree, and then eventually kill a squirrel.

00:11:53.500 --> 00:11:55.900
 Although it does say that all tree-huggers

00:11:55.900 --> 00:11:57.860
 are possessed with a love of the outdoors,

00:11:57.860 --> 00:11:59.540
 and actually catching a squirrel

00:11:59.540 --> 00:12:01.980
 isn't an iron-clad must any more than it is

00:12:01.980 --> 00:12:03.540
 for a fisherman to catch a fish,

00:12:03.540 --> 00:12:05.660
 which means I've fully misunderstood fishing as well.

00:12:05.660 --> 00:12:07.540
 (laughing)

00:12:07.540 --> 00:12:10.780
 - That first citation in the OED from 1965,

00:12:10.780 --> 00:12:13.980
 it was in South Shore, Chicago.

00:12:13.980 --> 00:12:16.540
 They were building a new road through a lot of parks,

00:12:16.540 --> 00:12:18.340
 and they had to chop down some trees,

00:12:18.340 --> 00:12:21.500
 and all of these conservationists sort of hugged the trees

00:12:21.500 --> 00:12:23.580
 and tried to stop them from doing it.

00:12:23.580 --> 00:12:25.740
 And it turns out that one of the protesters

00:12:25.740 --> 00:12:27.460
 was called Bernard Baum.

00:12:27.460 --> 00:12:30.180
 And Baum is German for tree.

00:12:30.180 --> 00:12:31.620
 - Yes. - Oh.

00:12:31.620 --> 00:12:33.180
 - Come on. - That's very good.

00:12:33.180 --> 00:12:34.780
 We're gonna have to move on in a sec, guys.

00:12:34.780 --> 00:12:38.540
 - Oh, can I tell you another sort of competition-related fact

00:12:38.540 --> 00:12:39.740
 that has something to do with trees?

00:12:39.740 --> 00:12:41.180
 It's about the World Concord Championships.

00:12:41.180 --> 00:12:42.020
 Have you guys read this?

00:12:42.020 --> 00:12:44.220
 Breaking news. - Yes, literally breaking.

00:12:44.220 --> 00:12:46.660
 - It's literally happening right now before our very eyes.

00:12:46.660 --> 00:12:48.180
 The investigation is going on.

00:12:48.180 --> 00:12:50.500
 It just happened in Northamptonshire,

00:12:50.500 --> 00:12:52.820
 and allegations of cheating.

00:12:52.820 --> 00:12:54.180
 And it's very serious.

00:12:54.180 --> 00:12:56.140
 There's this guy called David Jacobs.

00:12:56.140 --> 00:12:57.260
 He's 82.

00:12:57.260 --> 00:13:00.060
 He's been competing since 1977.

00:13:00.060 --> 00:13:02.660
 Every year goes to the World Concord Championships.

00:13:02.660 --> 00:13:04.500
 He won this time.

00:13:04.500 --> 00:13:08.260
 And now there are allegations he used as steel conker.

00:13:08.260 --> 00:13:10.340
 - And it was the first time he won, maybe?

00:13:10.340 --> 00:13:11.420
 - Yeah, yeah, it was the first time he's won.

00:13:11.420 --> 00:13:13.420
 - Yeah, yeah. - Also, he's the chief judge.

00:13:13.420 --> 00:13:14.900
 This goes all the way to the top.

00:13:14.900 --> 00:13:16.540
 - Yeah. - It's like, yeah.

00:13:16.540 --> 00:13:18.340
 - It's just like the dales all over.

00:13:18.340 --> 00:13:19.620
 - Absolutely. - He's got a painted,

00:13:19.620 --> 00:13:22.380
 he had a painted nut, which he said was just for humor value.

00:13:22.380 --> 00:13:24.860
 What's the humor value in, I guess,

00:13:24.860 --> 00:13:27.540
 it's a bit, if you play conkers, I guess it's funny.

00:13:27.540 --> 00:13:28.820
 - Yeah. - I guess.

00:13:28.820 --> 00:13:31.100
 - But it turns out he was concealing steel.

00:13:31.100 --> 00:13:32.780
 - Well, did he use the steel nut

00:13:32.780 --> 00:13:34.860
 to smash his opponents' conkers to pieces?

00:13:34.860 --> 00:13:35.700
 'Cause a couple of the opponents said,

00:13:35.700 --> 00:13:38.940
 "My conker just exploded when he tapped it for the first time."

00:13:38.940 --> 00:13:40.660
 And yeah, this is a huge, this is huge.

00:13:40.660 --> 00:13:42.140
 - And we just want to say for the lawyers,

00:13:42.140 --> 00:13:44.260
 nothing's been proven either way yet.

00:13:44.260 --> 00:13:45.740
 It's all still underway.

00:13:45.740 --> 00:13:47.100
 And he was actually defeated in the final.

00:13:47.100 --> 00:13:49.700
 It seems like they must be gender divided until the end,

00:13:49.700 --> 00:13:51.180
 'cause he won the men's section,

00:13:51.180 --> 00:13:54.060
 but then he was defeated by Kelsey Banshbuck

00:13:54.060 --> 00:13:57.820
 from Indianapolis, who came all the way to Northamptonshire

00:13:57.820 --> 00:13:59.660
 to defeat him in the final.

00:13:59.660 --> 00:14:00.500
 - Wow. - Wow.

00:14:00.500 --> 00:14:01.580
 - First American to win.

00:14:01.580 --> 00:14:02.540
 - And what was she using?

00:14:02.540 --> 00:14:04.260
 Like a platinum, a cover?

00:14:04.260 --> 00:14:06.660
 (all laughing)

00:14:06.660 --> 00:14:08.180
 - Put the conker in a shotgun, yeah.

00:14:08.180 --> 00:14:09.020
 - Can I tell you one more--

00:14:09.020 --> 00:14:10.620
 - Yeah, go for it. - Natural competition.

00:14:10.620 --> 00:14:12.660
 This was in 2002 in Australia.

00:14:12.660 --> 00:14:14.580
 They had a sheep counting competition.

00:14:14.580 --> 00:14:15.980
 - Oh, yeah.

00:14:15.980 --> 00:14:17.420
 - Like there were 10 competitors,

00:14:17.420 --> 00:14:19.660
 they ran 400 sheep past them.

00:14:19.660 --> 00:14:20.500
 - 400.

00:14:20.500 --> 00:14:22.620
 (all laughing)

00:14:22.620 --> 00:14:24.260
 - No, they didn't tell them they were 400,

00:14:24.260 --> 00:14:26.980
 but you had to count them as they ran past you.

00:14:26.980 --> 00:14:28.860
 There was an indeterminate number of sheep running past you

00:14:28.860 --> 00:14:29.700
 and you had to count them.

00:14:29.700 --> 00:14:31.980
 - I would count the legs and divide by four.

00:14:31.980 --> 00:14:33.300
 (all laughing)

00:14:33.300 --> 00:14:34.380
 - Show off. - Very good.

00:14:34.380 --> 00:14:35.220
 - And is it the idea

00:14:35.220 --> 00:14:37.020
 whoever's awake at the end is the winner?

00:14:37.020 --> 00:14:37.860
 - That's it.

00:14:37.860 --> 00:14:40.440
 (upbeat music)

00:14:43.740 --> 00:14:47.100
 - Okay, it is time for us to move on to fact number two,

00:14:47.100 --> 00:14:48.820
 and that is Anna.

00:14:48.820 --> 00:14:52.180
 - My fact this week is that the wax coating

00:14:52.180 --> 00:14:57.180
 on 6,400 shot bought apples is enough to make one tea light.

00:14:57.180 --> 00:14:58.700
 - Wow.

00:14:58.700 --> 00:15:00.900
 - Yes, apples, tomatoes, lemons, peppers,

00:15:00.900 --> 00:15:02.920
 you get in shops, it's all covered in wax,

00:15:02.920 --> 00:15:05.020
 but it's a very tiny layer.

00:15:05.020 --> 00:15:07.500
 There's lots of rumours that it can give you, you know,

00:15:07.500 --> 00:15:09.300
 cancer and make your head explode and stuff.

00:15:09.300 --> 00:15:11.700
 So I thought, I wonder how much they're actually putting on.

00:15:11.700 --> 00:15:14.020
 And I read that one pound of wax

00:15:14.020 --> 00:15:17.180
 will cover 160,000 pieces of fruit

00:15:17.180 --> 00:15:20.100
 and one pound of wax also makes,

00:15:20.100 --> 00:15:22.260
 according to various craft sites,

00:15:22.260 --> 00:15:23.740
 which I spent a long time on,

00:15:23.740 --> 00:15:26.940
 but I think one pound of wax makes about 25 tea candles.

00:15:26.940 --> 00:15:29.540
 And so there you go, 6,400 apples,

00:15:29.540 --> 00:15:32.900
 melt the wax off, you've got a tea light, you're welcome.

00:15:32.900 --> 00:15:33.820
 (all laughing)

00:15:33.820 --> 00:15:36.180
 - And a tea light is one of those little white round ones,

00:15:36.180 --> 00:15:37.020
 is it?

00:15:37.020 --> 00:15:38.380
 'Cause I had to look this up, actually.

00:15:38.380 --> 00:15:40.340
 - That is such a man thing to do.

00:15:40.340 --> 00:15:41.980
 (all laughing)

00:15:41.980 --> 00:15:44.820
 - No man listening knows what a tea light is,

00:15:44.820 --> 00:15:46.780
 and no woman listening doesn't, it's just a...

00:15:46.780 --> 00:15:50.260
 - And they were invented to make tea with or something.

00:15:50.260 --> 00:15:52.020
 I read that, I don't know if this is true,

00:15:52.020 --> 00:15:53.340
 'cause I didn't know what they were,

00:15:53.340 --> 00:15:56.260
 but apparently in the Japanese tea ceremony,

00:15:56.260 --> 00:15:58.620
 you have put them underneath your kettle to keep it warm.

00:15:58.620 --> 00:16:00.060
 - Oh my God, this is so weird,

00:16:00.060 --> 00:16:02.520
 because I've got a small kettle at home,

00:16:02.520 --> 00:16:04.380
 which has a tea light underneath it

00:16:04.380 --> 00:16:05.780
 for making the water warm.

00:16:05.780 --> 00:16:07.020
 And I just thought that was a gimmick

00:16:07.020 --> 00:16:08.360
 that they found to do with the tea light,

00:16:08.360 --> 00:16:10.060
 but you're telling me that's the original purpose.

00:16:10.060 --> 00:16:13.300
 - It looks like it has enough flame to keep something heat.

00:16:13.300 --> 00:16:15.140
 - Probably just sort of keep, you know, maintain.

00:16:15.140 --> 00:16:17.460
 - Just a little simmery.

00:16:17.460 --> 00:16:19.220
 - The wax is so weird.

00:16:19.220 --> 00:16:22.260
 So this happens even more in America

00:16:22.260 --> 00:16:23.100
 than it does in the UK.

00:16:23.100 --> 00:16:24.980
 Like in America, everything is sold

00:16:24.980 --> 00:16:27.060
 with a thin layer of wax on the top of it, basically.

00:16:27.060 --> 00:16:28.420
 - I think it's pretty much all fruit,

00:16:28.420 --> 00:16:29.700
 like all apples you buy in the shop here.

00:16:29.700 --> 00:16:30.620
 Yeah, all fruit you buy here

00:16:30.620 --> 00:16:32.020
 will also have all the other wax on it.

00:16:32.020 --> 00:16:35.100
 - But it's this thing called epicuticular wax,

00:16:35.100 --> 00:16:36.660
 like cuticles is in skin.

00:16:36.660 --> 00:16:40.860
 And the thing is, apples grow with a thin layer

00:16:40.860 --> 00:16:43.780
 of wax on them, which is then removed

00:16:43.780 --> 00:16:45.700
 during the harvesting process.

00:16:45.700 --> 00:16:47.420
 And they think, oh no, we lost all the wax

00:16:47.420 --> 00:16:49.460
 that was growing beautifully on the apple anyway.

00:16:49.460 --> 00:16:53.500
 So they put wax from a different species back on the apple.

00:16:53.500 --> 00:16:56.020
 - So I have a tree in my garden.

00:16:56.020 --> 00:16:57.540
 - Oh no. - It's no, Dan.

00:16:57.540 --> 00:16:59.820
 Leave it alone.

00:16:59.820 --> 00:17:01.340
 - Well, no, I took an apple off the tree

00:17:01.340 --> 00:17:02.460
 and it was very exciting.

00:17:02.460 --> 00:17:05.220
 It was like, my God, I've got an apple from my own garden.

00:17:05.220 --> 00:17:08.540
 And it was so waxy that even when I washed it

00:17:08.540 --> 00:17:11.620
 under the sink, it just took ages to get off.

00:17:11.620 --> 00:17:16.340
 Yeah, and I stupidly used washing liquid on it

00:17:16.340 --> 00:17:18.820
 at one point to try and get it off.

00:17:18.820 --> 00:17:21.620
 But yeah, I felt it literally the other day.

00:17:21.620 --> 00:17:22.780
 - That's cool 'cause it's quite,

00:17:22.780 --> 00:17:25.180
 usually on fruit it's quite powdery and unsightly.

00:17:25.180 --> 00:17:27.340
 You often see it on plums, it's most obvious,

00:17:27.340 --> 00:17:28.340
 it's like a white powder.

00:17:28.340 --> 00:17:29.860
 But why did you want to take it off?

00:17:29.860 --> 00:17:30.780
 It's fine.

00:17:30.780 --> 00:17:31.620
 - What do you mean?

00:17:31.620 --> 00:17:32.940
 Oh, I thought you meant off the tree to eat it.

00:17:32.940 --> 00:17:34.700
 (laughing)

00:17:34.700 --> 00:17:37.140
 - Oh, no, no, it just felt odd, it just felt.

00:17:37.140 --> 00:17:37.980
 - But it grows back.

00:17:37.980 --> 00:17:39.900
 Even if it gets scratched or removed during the harvesting,

00:17:39.900 --> 00:17:41.620
 it would grow back naturally.

00:17:41.620 --> 00:17:43.620
 But during those few days,

00:17:43.620 --> 00:17:44.780
 the fruit would shrink a little bit

00:17:44.780 --> 00:17:46.180
 'cause it's lost a layer of protection

00:17:46.180 --> 00:17:47.980
 and it would lose a little bit of volume.

00:17:47.980 --> 00:17:48.820
 - Moisture, right.

00:17:48.820 --> 00:17:49.660
 - Moisture.

00:17:49.660 --> 00:17:51.900
 And so it's worth spraying the wax on

00:17:51.900 --> 00:17:53.780
 because it keeps the fruit at exactly the same size

00:17:53.780 --> 00:17:55.620
 for that little few days in between.

00:17:55.620 --> 00:17:56.820
 - Yeah, it's essential.

00:17:56.820 --> 00:17:59.820
 Fruit would be shriveled in the process of making it

00:17:59.820 --> 00:18:02.100
 through the, you know, importing it,

00:18:02.100 --> 00:18:04.220
 getting it into a short process if we didn't have it on.

00:18:04.220 --> 00:18:05.620
 For the same reason they have it on trees.

00:18:05.620 --> 00:18:08.220
 It's so that nothing can get in, nothing can get out.

00:18:08.220 --> 00:18:09.740
 - But the wax that grows on plants,

00:18:09.740 --> 00:18:11.100
 this is, okay, this is unbelievable.

00:18:11.100 --> 00:18:13.140
 So it's amazing stuff, epi-cuticular wax.

00:18:13.140 --> 00:18:14.100
 It's really cool.

00:18:14.100 --> 00:18:15.740
 It repels water, it repels,

00:18:15.740 --> 00:18:17.100
 that's why plants are clean,

00:18:17.100 --> 00:18:18.300
 despite the fact that, you know,

00:18:18.300 --> 00:18:19.620
 water has all sorts of stuff in it,

00:18:19.620 --> 00:18:21.260
 the water just rolls off.

00:18:21.260 --> 00:18:24.020
 The other thing is, it makes it hard sometimes

00:18:24.020 --> 00:18:27.020
 if the plant wants to protect itself from insects

00:18:27.020 --> 00:18:29.660
 or other pests.

00:18:29.660 --> 00:18:33.260
 The wax itself makes it hard for the insects to walk on.

00:18:33.260 --> 00:18:35.900
 They fall off because the wax is kind of like

00:18:35.900 --> 00:18:37.620
 a travelator or whatever. - That's cool.

00:18:37.620 --> 00:18:41.660
 - And this is, there's an even more weird bit to it.

00:18:41.660 --> 00:18:43.020
 There is co-evolution.

00:18:43.020 --> 00:18:45.940
 So some plants rely on a single insect

00:18:45.940 --> 00:18:48.220
 to walk all over them and fertilize the flowers

00:18:48.220 --> 00:18:50.060
 or whatever it might be.

00:18:50.060 --> 00:18:55.060
 Some plants have kind of password protected wax.

00:18:55.060 --> 00:18:57.980
 So only their chosen insect partner

00:18:57.980 --> 00:19:00.860
 can walk along the leaves and the stems

00:19:00.860 --> 00:19:02.780
 without falling off and everything else falls off.

00:19:02.780 --> 00:19:05.300
 The insect's legs are the password.

00:19:05.300 --> 00:19:06.460
 - Oh, just hang on.

00:19:06.460 --> 00:19:08.660
 So does the insect's legs specially designed?

00:19:08.660 --> 00:19:10.380
 They've got little wax skates on their feet

00:19:10.380 --> 00:19:12.260
 or does the plant alter when it feels like an insect?

00:19:12.260 --> 00:19:14.260
 - Is it like using your fingerprint to open your phone?

00:19:14.260 --> 00:19:15.900
 - Yes, it's exactly like that.

00:19:15.900 --> 00:19:18.060
 - This is why King Charles talks to plants.

00:19:18.060 --> 00:19:19.980
 They're fucking sentient.

00:19:19.980 --> 00:19:21.420
 - Oh no, not this again.

00:19:21.420 --> 00:19:22.260
 - Come on.

00:19:22.260 --> 00:19:23.420
 - But it's amazing.

00:19:23.420 --> 00:19:24.260
 I just found that.

00:19:24.260 --> 00:19:25.100
 - Wow.

00:19:25.980 --> 00:19:26.820
 - Yeah.

00:19:26.820 --> 00:19:30.260
 - By the way, if they are sentient then

00:19:30.260 --> 00:19:31.980
 you've got a lot of consent to get.

00:19:31.980 --> 00:19:34.220
 (laughing)

00:19:34.220 --> 00:19:40.780
 - Operation U Tree's got nothing on you.

00:19:40.780 --> 00:19:43.020
 (laughing)

00:19:43.020 --> 00:19:48.220
 - Anyway.

00:19:48.220 --> 00:19:50.140
 - It's a huge industry.

00:19:50.140 --> 00:19:53.900
 The making wax to preserve food in industry.

00:19:53.900 --> 00:19:57.380
 And it's actually, it was patented in the 1920s

00:19:57.380 --> 00:20:00.220
 and Brogdon's original wax and kerosene makers

00:20:00.220 --> 00:20:03.060
 who painted it went to the Supreme Court to defend it.

00:20:03.060 --> 00:20:04.340
 This is how big a deal it is.

00:20:04.340 --> 00:20:07.100
 And these days, things get dipped in baths of it.

00:20:07.100 --> 00:20:09.220
 So when you're eating a melon,

00:20:09.220 --> 00:20:12.780
 it might have had a bath in wax before it came to you.

00:20:12.780 --> 00:20:15.060
 - And it could be made of lots of different types of wax,

00:20:15.060 --> 00:20:15.900
 right?

00:20:15.900 --> 00:20:18.700
 I think you said kerosene so you can get like paraffin wax.

00:20:18.700 --> 00:20:20.140
 Quite a lot of it is.

00:20:20.140 --> 00:20:22.380
 And then there's other ones that are less sound like

00:20:22.380 --> 00:20:24.660
 they've come for the petrochemical industry.

00:20:24.660 --> 00:20:26.420
 - Bees wax, they used to do it in.

00:20:26.420 --> 00:20:28.460
 Bees wax is every, you know what?

00:20:28.460 --> 00:20:30.180
 Bees get a lot of credit for honey,

00:20:30.180 --> 00:20:32.180
 but people don't talk about the wax that much.

00:20:32.180 --> 00:20:34.780
 - In the middle ages, they went on about it a lot.

00:20:34.780 --> 00:20:35.620
 - Did they?

00:20:35.620 --> 00:20:36.460
 - Oh my God.

00:20:36.460 --> 00:20:37.300
 (laughing)

00:20:37.300 --> 00:20:39.620
 They really wanked on about it properly.

00:20:39.620 --> 00:20:41.100
 - I think they were quite right.

00:20:41.100 --> 00:20:42.860
 - Well, because like in those days,

00:20:42.860 --> 00:20:45.860
 you had to light your house with candles, right?

00:20:45.860 --> 00:20:49.660
 And if you were just a normal person, a pleb like me,

00:20:49.660 --> 00:20:51.580
 then you would get it using tallow.

00:20:51.580 --> 00:20:53.220
 So you would cook your meat,

00:20:53.220 --> 00:20:55.540
 and then there would be some fat there.

00:20:55.540 --> 00:20:57.780
 And then a chandler, a candle maker would come round

00:20:57.780 --> 00:21:01.020
 to your house and he'd pick up all of the goo

00:21:01.020 --> 00:21:03.100
 and he'd turn it into a candle and you would burn it.

00:21:03.100 --> 00:21:03.940
 But it would stink.

00:21:03.940 --> 00:21:05.060
 It would really, really stink.

00:21:05.060 --> 00:21:07.980
 And all the houses would smell of burnt rubbish.

00:21:07.980 --> 00:21:10.660
 But then the church decided, well, we don't want that.

00:21:10.660 --> 00:21:12.780
 We want perfect white candles.

00:21:12.780 --> 00:21:15.260
 And we want it not to smell like old garbage.

00:21:15.260 --> 00:21:17.140
 And so they had to have beeswax.

00:21:17.140 --> 00:21:21.700
 And the beeswax industry in that time was off the charts.

00:21:21.700 --> 00:21:23.860
 They were like wars because the price

00:21:23.860 --> 00:21:25.300
 of beeswax went too high.

00:21:25.300 --> 00:21:26.140
 - Right.

00:21:26.140 --> 00:21:27.500
 - And they used it for everything, right?

00:21:27.500 --> 00:21:29.700
 They used it for lubricant, for waterproofing,

00:21:29.700 --> 00:21:31.940
 for all cosmetics are made of beeswax.

00:21:31.940 --> 00:21:33.540
 They didn't really have any other materials

00:21:33.540 --> 00:21:34.740
 except beeswax, practically.

00:21:34.740 --> 00:21:36.540
 - The other reason it was so good in church is,

00:21:36.540 --> 00:21:40.380
 is because they thought that bees were virgin born,

00:21:40.380 --> 00:21:41.740
 like Jesus.

00:21:41.740 --> 00:21:42.580
 - Oh.

00:21:42.580 --> 00:21:43.420
 - There was this thing.

00:21:43.420 --> 00:21:46.380
 And if you own bees and you look in your beehive,

00:21:46.380 --> 00:21:47.580
 they never have sex.

00:21:47.580 --> 00:21:50.500
 You can sit there watching them as long as you want, Dan.

00:21:50.500 --> 00:21:52.020
 They will not have sex.

00:21:52.020 --> 00:21:56.620
 Because they go, they kind of find a little region

00:21:56.620 --> 00:21:59.380
 and they all fly, all the drones fly to this little region

00:21:59.380 --> 00:22:01.820
 and then the queen flies there as well.

00:22:01.820 --> 00:22:03.900
 And then they have sex in the air while they're flying.

00:22:03.900 --> 00:22:05.340
 And then they all come back.

00:22:05.340 --> 00:22:06.780
 So no one ever saw them have sex

00:22:06.780 --> 00:22:07.980
 or they thought they were virgins.

00:22:07.980 --> 00:22:09.420
 - But that's the same as humans.

00:22:09.420 --> 00:22:11.740
 I never see humans have sex because very similarly,

00:22:11.740 --> 00:22:15.220
 they go to a special place where I'm not allowed

00:22:15.220 --> 00:22:17.340
 and they have sex there.

00:22:17.340 --> 00:22:19.140
 I don't assume everyone's a virgin

00:22:19.140 --> 00:22:22.060
 just because I haven't seen any of them shagging.

00:22:22.060 --> 00:22:24.180
 People were stupid in the middle ages, weren't they?

00:22:24.180 --> 00:22:25.100
 - Wow.

00:22:25.100 --> 00:22:28.100
 Can I tell you a thing about ancient Roman beeswax?

00:22:28.100 --> 00:22:28.940
 This is so cool.

00:22:28.940 --> 00:22:29.780
 Okay, I love this.

00:22:29.780 --> 00:22:33.980
 So you would have a wax mast made of yourself

00:22:33.980 --> 00:22:35.740
 and it was for use in life,

00:22:35.740 --> 00:22:37.580
 but it was also for use at your funeral.

00:22:37.580 --> 00:22:39.100
 - What would you use it for in life?

00:22:39.100 --> 00:22:39.940
 - I'm getting onto that.

00:22:39.940 --> 00:22:40.780
 Jesus.

00:22:40.780 --> 00:22:43.300
 - Sorry, you went straight to death.

00:22:43.300 --> 00:22:44.380
 - Sorry, sorry, sorry.

00:22:44.380 --> 00:22:45.980
 But it's all connected, that's the weird thing.

00:22:45.980 --> 00:22:50.100
 So about the age we all are, about 35 to 40,

00:22:50.100 --> 00:22:52.100
 you would have a wax mask made of yourself

00:22:52.100 --> 00:22:54.740
 and when you had reached political high office,

00:22:54.740 --> 00:22:57.220
 that's the four of us all have, sure,

00:22:57.220 --> 00:22:58.580
 you would have them in your hall,

00:22:58.580 --> 00:23:01.180
 but you would also have your ancestors wax masks,

00:23:01.180 --> 00:23:03.340
 normally male ones, but often some female ones too,

00:23:03.340 --> 00:23:05.700
 if you're a very politically connected family.

00:23:05.700 --> 00:23:08.420
 And at a funeral, you would hire a load of men

00:23:08.420 --> 00:23:12.540
 to wear these masks and pretend to be your male ancestors.

00:23:12.540 --> 00:23:13.820
 And if it was your funeral,

00:23:13.820 --> 00:23:16.620
 someone would be wearing a mask of you at your funeral,

00:23:16.620 --> 00:23:21.060
 dressed as you, dressed as the highest office you've achieved,

00:23:21.060 --> 00:23:25.540
 they would wear like a podcaster uniform or whatever.

00:23:25.540 --> 00:23:27.580
 - Is this the highest office we're gonna achieve?

00:23:27.580 --> 00:23:29.140
 - I'm afraid so.

00:23:29.140 --> 00:23:30.860
 - Yeah, they would take the piss out of you a bit as well,

00:23:30.860 --> 00:23:31.700
 wouldn't they?

00:23:31.700 --> 00:23:32.540
 - They would.

00:23:32.540 --> 00:23:33.980
 - I think they would wear this mask and wear your clothes

00:23:33.980 --> 00:23:35.740
 and then go up to your friends and go,

00:23:35.740 --> 00:23:36.940
 "Oh, I'm an idiot."

00:23:36.940 --> 00:23:39.380
 - That's quite nice.

00:23:39.380 --> 00:23:40.340
 Why did we stop doing it?

00:23:40.340 --> 00:23:41.180
 - I don't know.

00:23:41.180 --> 00:23:42.020
 - And then we should bring it back.

00:23:42.020 --> 00:23:45.060
 - The fall of Rome, yet again, screwing everything up.

00:23:45.060 --> 00:23:47.380
 But the other thing you would have in your front hall,

00:23:47.380 --> 00:23:48.860
 you would have this wall of faces,

00:23:48.860 --> 00:23:50.620
 like here are my male ancestors,

00:23:50.620 --> 00:23:52.500
 you would have a wall of your family tree,

00:23:52.500 --> 00:23:55.100
 and you would have a wall of military spoils

00:23:55.100 --> 00:23:57.380
 that your family had seized in battle.

00:23:57.380 --> 00:23:58.860
 So as someone came into your front hall,

00:23:58.860 --> 00:24:00.700
 they would get the full works of like,

00:24:00.700 --> 00:24:03.220
 "Here is what a great kind of guy I am."

00:24:03.220 --> 00:24:04.060
 - Nice.

00:24:04.060 --> 00:24:07.180
 - Hey, actually, back to candles and sex,

00:24:07.180 --> 00:24:08.420
 were we talking about that at all?

00:24:08.420 --> 00:24:09.540
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:24:09.540 --> 00:24:11.700
 - Have you guys read about brothel candles?

00:24:11.700 --> 00:24:12.540
 - No.

00:24:12.540 --> 00:24:13.740
 - I think I can guess what they are.

00:24:13.740 --> 00:24:15.300
 - Yeah, so this is interesting.

00:24:15.300 --> 00:24:16.860
 This is around the 1880s,

00:24:16.860 --> 00:24:19.260
 and it was into the early 1900s.

00:24:19.260 --> 00:24:22.180
 The idea was that in the brothel itself,

00:24:22.180 --> 00:24:24.500
 every sex worker there would have a candle

00:24:24.500 --> 00:24:26.640
 that would burn down in seven minutes,

00:24:26.640 --> 00:24:28.700
 and that's how you knew when the session was over.

00:24:28.700 --> 00:24:30.020
 - That's a lot of pressure,

00:24:30.020 --> 00:24:32.060
 which you don't want, do you?

00:24:32.060 --> 00:24:33.180
 That's gonna ruin it.

00:24:33.180 --> 00:24:36.700
 I mean, you know,

00:24:36.700 --> 00:24:38.180
 I'm not asking you personally down,

00:24:38.180 --> 00:24:40.660
 and I don't want to know the answer.

00:24:40.660 --> 00:24:42.820
 - You got any seven second candles?

00:24:42.820 --> 00:24:45.060
 (laughing)

00:24:45.060 --> 00:24:47.640
 (upbeat music)

00:24:47.640 --> 00:24:53.220
 - It is time for fact number three,

00:24:53.220 --> 00:24:54.940
 and that is James.

00:24:54.940 --> 00:24:56.540
 - Okay, my fact this week

00:24:56.540 --> 00:25:00.100
 is that the first known example of mastitis

00:25:00.100 --> 00:25:03.060
 was in an empress called a tosser.

00:25:03.060 --> 00:25:04.860
 (laughing)

00:25:04.860 --> 00:25:06.260
 She was cured,

00:25:06.260 --> 00:25:08.500
 and the doctor's payment was to be allowed

00:25:08.500 --> 00:25:10.140
 to invade Greece.

00:25:10.140 --> 00:25:12.380
 (laughing)

00:25:12.380 --> 00:25:17.340
 - Yeah, so we're talking the Achaemenid Empire,

00:25:17.340 --> 00:25:19.180
 as I'm sure you all know,

00:25:19.180 --> 00:25:22.140
 based in Iran in the fifth century BC.

00:25:22.140 --> 00:25:24.500
 They were the biggest empire in the world at the time,

00:25:24.500 --> 00:25:27.380
 and then eventually they went on and fought the Greeks,

00:25:27.380 --> 00:25:30.800
 and if you know that movie, The 300, I think it's called,

00:25:30.800 --> 00:25:32.220
 - It's a documentary, isn't it?

00:25:32.220 --> 00:25:33.900
 - It's a documentary.

00:25:33.900 --> 00:25:35.780
 Well, it's about 300 Spartans

00:25:35.780 --> 00:25:37.500
 who fought against all these Persians,

00:25:37.500 --> 00:25:40.140
 and these are the bad guys in that movie.

00:25:40.140 --> 00:25:43.500
 - Oh, yes, they got a very, very bad rap,

00:25:43.500 --> 00:25:45.100
 the Persians in this film,

00:25:45.100 --> 00:25:49.780
 as in the portrayal as being really dreadful types.

00:25:49.780 --> 00:25:51.940
 - Well, they were like, I haven't seen the movie,

00:25:51.940 --> 00:25:54.580
 but they're like, they were super soldiers.

00:25:54.580 --> 00:25:56.220
 - Normally when you say, I haven't seen the movie,

00:25:56.220 --> 00:25:57.780
 it's 'cause we're talking about quite a good movie,

00:25:57.780 --> 00:26:01.500
 and you absolutely don't have to watch 300.

00:26:01.500 --> 00:26:02.340
 - That's good to know.

00:26:02.340 --> 00:26:04.180
 I haven't watched the first 299,

00:26:04.180 --> 00:26:06.980
 so I wouldn't know what was happening anyway.

00:26:06.980 --> 00:26:11.660
 - So, Etosse, she was the daughter of King Cyrus the Great,

00:26:11.660 --> 00:26:14.220
 she was the wife of Darius the Great,

00:26:14.220 --> 00:26:16.620
 and she was the mother of Xerxes the Great.

00:26:16.620 --> 00:26:18.340
 - Okay.

00:26:18.340 --> 00:26:20.580
 - So, behind every great man, there was Etosse.

00:26:20.580 --> 00:26:23.980
 (audience laughing)

00:26:23.980 --> 00:26:26.740
 And she was like, a lot of what we know about her

00:26:26.740 --> 00:26:28.260
 was written by Herodotus,

00:26:28.260 --> 00:26:31.620
 and he basically put her as the power behind the throne

00:26:31.620 --> 00:26:33.300
 in all these different situations.

00:26:33.300 --> 00:26:34.140
 - And he was Greek.

00:26:34.140 --> 00:26:36.420
 - And he was Greek, so he was writing about them, yeah.

00:26:36.420 --> 00:26:40.900
 - Yeah, she was also a wife twice, right?

00:26:40.900 --> 00:26:43.180
 - Three, I think.

00:26:43.180 --> 00:26:45.420
 - Okay, but she married her brother at one point, didn't she?

00:26:45.420 --> 00:26:46.580
 - She did marry her brother.

00:26:46.580 --> 00:26:47.900
 - Not her choice.

00:26:47.900 --> 00:26:48.740
 - No.

00:26:48.740 --> 00:26:49.580
 - His choice.

00:26:49.580 --> 00:26:50.420
 - His choice.

00:26:50.420 --> 00:26:51.780
 It was kind of a dumb thing at the time,

00:26:51.780 --> 00:26:55.940
 and her brother was basically trying to get the empire,

00:26:55.940 --> 00:26:57.180
 and he thought that this,

00:26:57.180 --> 00:26:59.620
 a bit like the Egyptians would sometimes marry brothers

00:26:59.620 --> 00:27:02.420
 and sisters because it would make them a stronger unit.

00:27:02.420 --> 00:27:05.260
 - Well, I think it was illegal to do that.

00:27:05.260 --> 00:27:07.300
 - It wasn't, he made it legal.

00:27:07.300 --> 00:27:08.740
 - Yeah, that's a good thing about being king,

00:27:08.740 --> 00:27:10.940
 and he actually married two of his sisters, didn't he?

00:27:10.940 --> 00:27:12.740
 He married her and another sister,

00:27:12.740 --> 00:27:14.500
 and I think he might have married his niece

00:27:14.500 --> 00:27:15.340
 at one point as well.

00:27:15.340 --> 00:27:17.900
 - Wait, was that, was that Cambyses, just to be?

00:27:17.900 --> 00:27:18.740
 - Yeah, Cambyses, yeah.

00:27:18.740 --> 00:27:20.100
 - The first husband of a tosser.

00:27:20.100 --> 00:27:20.940
 - Yeah.

00:27:20.940 --> 00:27:21.760
 - Okay.

00:27:21.760 --> 00:27:22.600
 - But you were quite limited,

00:27:22.600 --> 00:27:24.060
 because if you belonged to one of the noble,

00:27:24.060 --> 00:27:26.500
 poshest families, or the royal family at that time,

00:27:26.500 --> 00:27:29.620
 you could only marry someone from the seven,

00:27:29.620 --> 00:27:31.300
 which is such a cool thing to be a member of,

00:27:31.300 --> 00:27:33.780
 and it was the seven most important families.

00:27:33.780 --> 00:27:35.380
 - So it was a small pool.

00:27:35.380 --> 00:27:37.540
 - I think Snow White had the same issue, didn't she?

00:27:37.540 --> 00:27:39.800
 (laughing)

00:27:39.800 --> 00:27:44.460
 - But then Cambyses, the brother, went away,

00:27:44.460 --> 00:27:47.340
 and their brother, Bardia, usurped the throne.

00:27:47.340 --> 00:27:50.660
 This is all kind of very, very late gossip of the,

00:27:50.660 --> 00:27:51.500
 how's it pronounced?

00:27:51.500 --> 00:27:52.460
 Akameneid?

00:27:52.460 --> 00:27:53.300
 - The Akimeneid.

00:27:53.300 --> 00:27:54.140
 - Or Persian.

00:27:54.140 --> 00:27:54.980
 - Just call it the Persian.

00:27:54.980 --> 00:27:56.580
 - Persian, the Persian empire.

00:27:56.580 --> 00:27:59.300
 But then the person, Darius the Great,

00:27:59.300 --> 00:28:01.980
 was the one who became her big deal husband,

00:28:01.980 --> 00:28:06.580
 and he assassinated Bardia, who was the usurper.

00:28:06.580 --> 00:28:08.980
 And then to sort of cement his control of power,

00:28:08.980 --> 00:28:13.580
 he married all Cyrus the Great's female descendants.

00:28:13.580 --> 00:28:14.420
 - Yeah.

00:28:14.420 --> 00:28:16.380
 - As in just, he married the whole family.

00:28:16.380 --> 00:28:17.220
 - It was a different time.

00:28:17.220 --> 00:28:18.660
 - It was a different time.

00:28:18.660 --> 00:28:20.620
 - Not so many trees in Persia.

00:28:20.620 --> 00:28:21.460
 - No.

00:28:21.460 --> 00:28:22.700
 (laughing)

00:28:22.700 --> 00:28:24.660
 - Yeah, they were brutal, though, weren't they,

00:28:24.660 --> 00:28:27.140
 the Persians, with the torture that they did.

00:28:27.140 --> 00:28:28.100
 - Oh, really?

00:28:28.100 --> 00:28:30.180
 - Well, it's just the examples are wild.

00:28:30.180 --> 00:28:32.820
 Like, I was reading about, so Cambyses,

00:28:32.820 --> 00:28:36.540
 he had a judge who had done some behind the scenes stuff

00:28:36.540 --> 00:28:38.180
 that he was unhappy with.

00:28:38.180 --> 00:28:42.100
 And so he basically had this judge killed,

00:28:42.100 --> 00:28:44.500
 and then stripped of his skin,

00:28:44.500 --> 00:28:47.060
 and then to remind any next judge

00:28:47.060 --> 00:28:49.940
 not to do all the bad stuff that this guy had done,

00:28:49.940 --> 00:28:53.620
 they laid the strips of his skin over the judge's chair

00:28:53.620 --> 00:28:55.220
 that the next judge had to sit on, right?

00:28:55.220 --> 00:28:59.100
 So the next judge was sitting on the previous judge.

00:28:59.100 --> 00:28:59.940
 - Wow.

00:28:59.940 --> 00:29:02.460
 - And the next judge was the son of the previous judge.

00:29:02.460 --> 00:29:03.500
 - Oh, no.

00:29:03.500 --> 00:29:05.260
 - By the way, so weird that the groan came

00:29:05.260 --> 00:29:06.980
 only when I said the son had to sit

00:29:06.980 --> 00:29:09.140
 on the skin of the guitar.

00:29:09.140 --> 00:29:11.740
 - But is it possible that this is a load

00:29:11.740 --> 00:29:13.700
 of kind of Greek-y propaganda?

00:29:13.700 --> 00:29:15.940
 'Cause I think most, like loads of what we know about Persia

00:29:15.940 --> 00:29:18.860
 comes from historians like Herodotus, who were Greek,

00:29:18.860 --> 00:29:21.540
 and had a good reason for--

00:29:21.540 --> 00:29:22.780
 - That is true.

00:29:22.780 --> 00:29:25.380
 - In fact, a tosser who is written about

00:29:25.380 --> 00:29:29.580
 as the most important powerful female member

00:29:29.580 --> 00:29:34.500
 of the Achaemenid Empire, also maybe didn't exist.

00:29:34.500 --> 00:29:36.220
 Maybe, so-- - Wow, why?

00:29:36.220 --> 00:29:39.740
 - Well, she's the only sources we have are Herodotus,

00:29:39.740 --> 00:29:41.420
 who famously made up a lot of shit.

00:29:41.420 --> 00:29:43.860
 I sometimes like to think that Herodotus just made it all up,

00:29:43.860 --> 00:29:45.820
 and basically everything we know

00:29:45.820 --> 00:29:48.580
 about Greek and Persian history is just from his head.

00:29:48.580 --> 00:29:50.660
 But I think it's Herodotus, an Aeschylus play

00:29:50.660 --> 00:29:53.340
 that mentioned her, but so it could be.

00:29:53.340 --> 00:29:55.260
 - Well, we know that Darius existed.

00:29:55.260 --> 00:29:56.500
 - Definitely, and Cyrus the Great--

00:29:56.500 --> 00:29:58.340
 - I think Cyrus existed, and Xerxes existed.

00:29:58.340 --> 00:30:00.860
 - 100%, Cyrus the Great was great, by the way.

00:30:00.860 --> 00:30:01.700
 - Oh, yeah.

00:30:01.700 --> 00:30:04.660
 - You know, you read about old kings, emperors, et cetera,

00:30:04.660 --> 00:30:05.780
 and they're all bastards.

00:30:05.780 --> 00:30:08.180
 Cyrus the Great, he's one of those annoying people,

00:30:08.180 --> 00:30:11.140
 he's just a good, all-round guy.

00:30:11.140 --> 00:30:13.180
 He's just constantly doing nice stuff,

00:30:13.180 --> 00:30:15.460
 so he forgave people constantly.

00:30:15.460 --> 00:30:18.220
 He was very famous for when he invaded somewhere,

00:30:18.220 --> 00:30:20.860
 he'd, instead of killing people or taking them prisoner,

00:30:20.860 --> 00:30:22.820
 he'd draw them into his bureaucracy

00:30:22.820 --> 00:30:24.540
 or into the top of his military.

00:30:24.540 --> 00:30:26.380
 He was the grandson of this guy.

00:30:26.380 --> 00:30:27.540
 - What a nice guy.

00:30:27.540 --> 00:30:28.380
 (laughing)

00:30:28.380 --> 00:30:29.220
 - What, that is nice.

00:30:29.220 --> 00:30:32.380
 - I've taken over your entire country.

00:30:32.380 --> 00:30:33.980
 I'm gonna let you join my side.

00:30:33.980 --> 00:30:35.340
 - It was a different time.

00:30:35.340 --> 00:30:36.380
 - It was a different time.

00:30:36.380 --> 00:30:37.220
 - It is a different time.

00:30:37.220 --> 00:30:39.700
 - It was, that meant good in those days.

00:30:39.700 --> 00:30:41.780
 He famously captured Babylon.

00:30:41.780 --> 00:30:43.420
 He did it quite cleverly at night,

00:30:43.420 --> 00:30:47.700
 so he overnight managed to divert the whole river Euphrates

00:30:47.700 --> 00:30:50.420
 into a canal so that his soldiers could just walk

00:30:50.420 --> 00:30:54.220
 across a riverbed, and so he arrived in Babylon.

00:30:54.220 --> 00:30:56.220
 Everyone in Babylon woke up and gave up,

00:30:56.220 --> 00:30:57.740
 well, oh my God, how did you get here?

00:30:57.740 --> 00:30:59.220
 And he released all the Jews there,

00:30:59.220 --> 00:31:01.380
 had been taken captive there,

00:31:01.380 --> 00:31:03.700
 and said, you know, said you can go back to Jerusalem,

00:31:03.700 --> 00:31:05.300
 so Jewish people loved him.

00:31:05.300 --> 00:31:08.700
 He defeated his grandpa, who tried to murder him,

00:31:08.700 --> 00:31:10.780
 and immediately forgave him,

00:31:10.780 --> 00:31:12.980
 although I think he killed all of his grandpa's kids,

00:31:12.980 --> 00:31:14.180
 'cause they might be threats.

00:31:14.180 --> 00:31:15.500
 But every good guy--

00:31:15.500 --> 00:31:16.820
 - Does that include his dad?

00:31:16.820 --> 00:31:21.100
 - I don't think it did include his dad, no.

00:31:21.100 --> 00:31:22.460
 He didn't include his own dad.

00:31:22.460 --> 00:31:25.340
 - You really, the more you talk about this Cyrus guy,

00:31:25.340 --> 00:31:26.940
 the less unconvinced you--

00:31:26.940 --> 00:31:29.020
 - Yeah, he was the guy who started this army

00:31:29.020 --> 00:31:32.500
 that's in the 300, and they were known as the Immortals,

00:31:32.500 --> 00:31:35.260
 and there were 10,000 of them in this army.

00:31:35.260 --> 00:31:36.540
 And the way that they did it was,

00:31:36.540 --> 00:31:41.540
 if ever any of them got killed or injured or a bit sick

00:31:41.540 --> 00:31:44.340
 or just didn't fancy it, then they would go off,

00:31:44.340 --> 00:31:45.820
 they would take them off the battlefield

00:31:45.820 --> 00:31:47.980
 and immediately replace them with someone else.

00:31:47.980 --> 00:31:48.820
 - Right.

00:31:48.820 --> 00:31:51.180
 - So as far as you're concerned, the enemy,

00:31:51.180 --> 00:31:53.020
 there are always 10,000 of them,

00:31:53.020 --> 00:31:54.980
 and so you think they are immortal.

00:31:54.980 --> 00:31:57.820
 - Can you just tap out by raising a hand?

00:31:57.820 --> 00:31:58.820
 (all laughing)

00:31:58.820 --> 00:32:00.100
 I've really had a great time.

00:32:00.100 --> 00:32:03.660
 I've met a lot of friends, but I'm done.

00:32:03.660 --> 00:32:04.620
 - Is it like NFL?

00:32:04.620 --> 00:32:05.860
 Is that what they do in NFL?

00:32:05.860 --> 00:32:07.180
 - Oh yeah, bring on the offense.

00:32:07.180 --> 00:32:08.700
 I think they're all offense in this case.

00:32:08.700 --> 00:32:09.860
 (all laughing)

00:32:09.860 --> 00:32:11.820
 They were tiaras.

00:32:11.820 --> 00:32:14.940
 They were called tiaras, but they were actually felt caps.

00:32:14.940 --> 00:32:15.780
 - Right.

00:32:15.780 --> 00:32:18.340
 - And the main thing they used was a spear,

00:32:18.340 --> 00:32:19.780
 and it was a really long spear,

00:32:19.780 --> 00:32:22.420
 and they had a counterbalance at the end of the spear,

00:32:22.420 --> 00:32:25.020
 and the counterbalance would be a different type of fruit,

00:32:25.020 --> 00:32:27.220
 depending on how good you were.

00:32:27.220 --> 00:32:28.940
 So the best possible thing you could have

00:32:28.940 --> 00:32:31.620
 was a little like an apple at the end of your spear,

00:32:31.620 --> 00:32:33.900
 and then you were part of the apple regiment.

00:32:33.900 --> 00:32:35.580
 - Well, 'cause that meant you had to suspend

00:32:35.580 --> 00:32:37.020
 more weight at the front,

00:32:37.020 --> 00:32:38.540
 or as if you had like a watermelon.

00:32:38.540 --> 00:32:40.660
 - Yeah, so the counterbalance was so that you could have

00:32:40.660 --> 00:32:42.740
 a longer spear and it wouldn't dip down,

00:32:42.740 --> 00:32:45.220
 but actually the weight of the thing would always be the same,

00:32:45.220 --> 00:32:46.740
 it would just be in the shape of an apple

00:32:46.740 --> 00:32:49.020
 or a banana or a grape or something.

00:32:49.020 --> 00:32:49.940
 - That's nice.

00:32:49.940 --> 00:32:51.660
 - I'm trying to think of a really shit fruit

00:32:51.660 --> 00:32:55.260
 if you had a raspberry or something on the end, or...

00:32:55.260 --> 00:32:58.380
 - They were kind of famously luxury-loving the Persians,

00:32:58.380 --> 00:32:59.900
 and this again is a lot of propaganda

00:32:59.900 --> 00:33:01.140
 that was dished out by the Greeks.

00:33:01.140 --> 00:33:03.700
 Basically, the Greeks kept saying,

00:33:03.700 --> 00:33:05.020
 "These people wear trousers,

00:33:05.020 --> 00:33:07.940
 "they're just too addicted to luxury."

00:33:07.940 --> 00:33:09.580
 (audience laughing)

00:33:09.580 --> 00:33:11.660
 Genuinely, that was an example that is...

00:33:11.660 --> 00:33:13.620
 Their kings have parasols.

00:33:13.620 --> 00:33:15.260
 Embarrassing.

00:33:15.260 --> 00:33:17.180
 A servant has to shade your king with a little umbrella.

00:33:17.180 --> 00:33:20.100
 It's a little bit weak, so there was a lot of that.

00:33:20.100 --> 00:33:23.660
 But one of the great things they had in the Persian Empire,

00:33:23.660 --> 00:33:27.100
 post, so as I look at this,

00:33:27.100 --> 00:33:28.900
 it's now less exciting than I think it...

00:33:28.900 --> 00:33:31.740
 (audience laughing)

00:33:31.740 --> 00:33:33.380
 I think it's just really interesting.

00:33:33.380 --> 00:33:35.740
 They have an amazing postal system.

00:33:35.740 --> 00:33:37.620
 Sometimes you look down at a note,

00:33:37.620 --> 00:33:38.940
 the confidence just drains,

00:33:38.940 --> 00:33:40.420
 like all the blood drains from the face.

00:33:40.420 --> 00:33:42.420
 (audience laughing)

00:33:42.420 --> 00:33:44.780
 - Did they have a morning and afternoon post, Andy?

00:33:44.780 --> 00:33:45.940
 (audience laughing)

00:33:45.940 --> 00:33:47.660
 James, they had so many posts.

00:33:47.660 --> 00:33:49.420
 Honestly, they make the current post office look

00:33:49.420 --> 00:33:50.420
 absolute dog shit.

00:33:50.420 --> 00:33:51.260
 They were just...

00:33:51.260 --> 00:33:52.780
 (audience laughing)

00:33:52.780 --> 00:33:55.060
 Like a huge empire, so you have to get stuff,

00:33:55.060 --> 00:33:57.020
 you know, like thousands of kilometers.

00:33:57.020 --> 00:33:58.780
 - Yeah, so it went basically all the way to the Balkans,

00:33:58.780 --> 00:34:00.580
 like where Albania is today,

00:34:00.580 --> 00:34:02.780
 all the way to the edge of where Iran is today.

00:34:02.780 --> 00:34:03.740
 So it's absolutely massive.

00:34:03.740 --> 00:34:05.140
 - Exactly, and they had this amazing thing called

00:34:05.140 --> 00:34:07.180
 the Royal Road, which was basically only allowed

00:34:07.180 --> 00:34:09.260
 for the use of posties and the army.

00:34:09.260 --> 00:34:11.380
 And to go all the way from Western Iran

00:34:11.380 --> 00:34:13.020
 to what is now Western Turkey,

00:34:13.020 --> 00:34:14.300
 a place called Sardis,

00:34:14.300 --> 00:34:15.700
 two and a half thousand kilometers,

00:34:15.700 --> 00:34:17.220
 on foot it would take three months,

00:34:17.220 --> 00:34:18.860
 they could get posted in a week.

00:34:18.860 --> 00:34:20.220
 - Right, so amazing. - So that genuinely

00:34:20.220 --> 00:34:22.580
 was amazing, and it was the fastest land travel system

00:34:22.580 --> 00:34:24.020
 in the world at the time,

00:34:24.020 --> 00:34:26.180
 'cause it relied on very, very fast horse relays.

00:34:26.180 --> 00:34:28.180
 You would just ride a horse for, you know,

00:34:28.180 --> 00:34:30.700
 as long as it could go, and as soon as it stopped,

00:34:30.700 --> 00:34:32.500
 another horseman would take the post and go on.

00:34:32.500 --> 00:34:35.260
 - Yes, and the stations were set up for that, weren't they?

00:34:35.260 --> 00:34:37.380
 So Cyrus, when he set up the post stations,

00:34:37.380 --> 00:34:38.940
 worked out exactly how long the horse

00:34:38.940 --> 00:34:41.060
 can go at full speed before it just collapses,

00:34:41.060 --> 00:34:42.820
 and then where the horse is fainted,

00:34:42.820 --> 00:34:44.340
 he builds a little post office.

00:34:44.340 --> 00:34:45.260
 - Lovely man. - And then he's like,

00:34:45.260 --> 00:34:48.140
 "Leave the next horse here, a nice guy."

00:34:48.140 --> 00:34:50.300
 - I should just explain the fact.

00:34:50.300 --> 00:34:51.380
 - Oh yeah. - That he started with.

00:34:51.380 --> 00:34:52.740
 - Oh yeah. - This doctor,

00:34:52.740 --> 00:34:54.380
 who was allowed to invade Greece.

00:34:54.380 --> 00:34:56.660
 So he was called Demosides,

00:34:56.660 --> 00:34:59.540
 and he'd been previously taken as a slave in a raid,

00:34:59.540 --> 00:35:02.900
 and he'd found himself in this Achaemenid empire.

00:35:02.900 --> 00:35:07.900
 And Darius the Great, who was a tosser's husband,

00:35:07.900 --> 00:35:10.380
 he had broken his ankle, right?

00:35:10.380 --> 00:35:11.580
 He'd fallen off his horse,

00:35:11.580 --> 00:35:13.940
 and really actually dislocated his ankle.

00:35:13.940 --> 00:35:16.580
 And all of his doctors tried to help him,

00:35:16.580 --> 00:35:17.980
 and the way they tried to help him

00:35:17.980 --> 00:35:20.460
 was basically yanking him around,

00:35:20.460 --> 00:35:21.620
 and pulling him up and down,

00:35:21.620 --> 00:35:23.460
 and hopefully it would get back in place.

00:35:23.460 --> 00:35:25.060
 - Right. - And he absolutely hated it.

00:35:25.060 --> 00:35:27.580
 He was unable to sleep, he was in so much pain.

00:35:27.580 --> 00:35:29.140
 But he found this guy, Demosides,

00:35:29.140 --> 00:35:31.020
 who had been taken as a slave,

00:35:31.020 --> 00:35:33.660
 and this guy was a doctor.

00:35:33.660 --> 00:35:36.540
 And Demosides made his leg better,

00:35:36.540 --> 00:35:40.260
 and to say thank you,

00:35:40.260 --> 00:35:43.700
 he gave him two sets of golden shackles.

00:35:43.700 --> 00:35:45.180
 So he was basically saying,

00:35:45.180 --> 00:35:48.820
 "You're still enslaved, but at least you've got gold now."

00:35:48.820 --> 00:35:49.940
 - Nice. - Oh, wow.

00:35:49.940 --> 00:35:54.300
 - Anyway, so then Demosides becomes very popular.

00:35:54.300 --> 00:35:57.220
 A tosser gets his boil on her breast.

00:35:57.220 --> 00:36:00.820
 We think now it's mastitis because he managed to cure her,

00:36:00.820 --> 00:36:02.420
 and he wouldn't be able to do any surgery,

00:36:02.420 --> 00:36:03.740
 and she lived quite a long age,

00:36:03.740 --> 00:36:05.660
 so we think it probably was mastitis.

00:36:05.660 --> 00:36:08.100
 He manages to cure her, and he says,

00:36:08.100 --> 00:36:11.420
 "I will only cure you if you give me anything in return."

00:36:11.420 --> 00:36:12.540
 She says, "Fine."

00:36:12.540 --> 00:36:16.100
 He says, "Well, let me go to Greece as part of a raid."

00:36:16.100 --> 00:36:18.020
 And then when he gets to Greece, he escapes,

00:36:18.020 --> 00:36:19.580
 because that's where he was from originally

00:36:19.580 --> 00:36:21.140
 when he was enslaved. - Oh, yeah.

00:36:21.140 --> 00:36:22.420
 - So that's kind of the story.

00:36:22.420 --> 00:36:25.700
 - And he goes back to Croton, which is where he was from,

00:36:25.700 --> 00:36:27.980
 and he marries the daughter

00:36:27.980 --> 00:36:30.980
 of a really famous wrestler called Milo.

00:36:30.980 --> 00:36:33.260
 And this guy is extraordinary.

00:36:33.260 --> 00:36:34.500
 Have we spoken about him before?

00:36:34.500 --> 00:36:35.820
 - I don't think so. - I don't think we have.

00:36:35.820 --> 00:36:40.420
 He was an Olympian. He won six Olympic events in his time,

00:36:40.420 --> 00:36:43.620
 and he was just one of those guys who was so big and massive,

00:36:43.620 --> 00:36:45.940
 he could do feets of strength that almost seemed impossible,

00:36:45.940 --> 00:36:49.380
 so he could hold out his arm with his fingers outstretched

00:36:49.380 --> 00:36:53.700
 and challenge people to attempt to bend his little finger,

00:36:53.700 --> 00:36:54.700
 and they couldn't do it.

00:36:54.700 --> 00:36:56.900
 They would be trying, and he'd be going, "Wah!"

00:36:56.900 --> 00:36:59.140
 He would stand on a greased iron disc

00:36:59.140 --> 00:37:01.140
 and challenge people to push him off it.

00:37:01.140 --> 00:37:03.100
 They never could.

00:37:03.100 --> 00:37:05.220
 He could hold a pomegranate in one hand

00:37:05.220 --> 00:37:07.180
 and challenge others to take it from him.

00:37:07.180 --> 00:37:08.180
 Nobody could.

00:37:08.180 --> 00:37:11.420
 And despite holding it very tightly, it was never damaged.

00:37:11.420 --> 00:37:13.220
 This guy is incredible.

00:37:13.220 --> 00:37:15.540
 And in his off years, he was trained by carrying

00:37:15.540 --> 00:37:18.140
 a newborn calf on his back every day

00:37:18.140 --> 00:37:19.940
 until the Olympics took place,

00:37:19.940 --> 00:37:23.420
 by which time he was carrying a four-year-old cow on his back,

00:37:23.420 --> 00:37:27.020
 and he would carry it the length of the stadium

00:37:27.020 --> 00:37:30.140
 and then kill it, roast it, and eat it as part of like,

00:37:30.140 --> 00:37:33.100
 an intimate, like doing the hacker that the New Zealanders do.

00:37:33.100 --> 00:37:34.740
 It was like his intimidation process.

00:37:34.740 --> 00:37:36.260
 What a life for that cow.

00:37:36.260 --> 00:37:37.260
 What the hell?

00:37:37.260 --> 00:37:38.260
 Incredible.

00:37:38.260 --> 00:37:39.980
 Four years on someone's shoulders and then killed.

00:37:39.980 --> 00:37:40.980
 Yeah, exactly.

00:37:40.980 --> 00:37:42.220
 You'd think you're like best buddies,

00:37:42.220 --> 00:37:43.700
 but then suddenly, yeah.

00:37:43.700 --> 00:37:45.820
 And so then the legend goes that he died

00:37:45.820 --> 00:37:48.380
 when he tried to show one final bit of feeder strength,

00:37:48.380 --> 00:37:51.860
 which was he was passing a man who was chopping a tree,

00:37:51.860 --> 00:37:55.620
 and he said, "I will rip this trunk in half

00:37:55.620 --> 00:37:57.100
 "with my bare hands."

00:37:57.100 --> 00:37:59.340
 And the guy said, "Incredible."

00:37:59.340 --> 00:38:01.860
 He said, "What an honor for you to do that, Milo."

00:38:01.860 --> 00:38:05.140
 And for some reason, the guy then went off while he did it,

00:38:05.140 --> 00:38:07.620
 and as he stretched to separate it,

00:38:07.620 --> 00:38:11.860
 something cracked and his fingers went in and he got stuck,

00:38:11.860 --> 00:38:14.540
 and he just died 'cause the guy didn't come back.

00:38:14.540 --> 00:38:15.620
 Oh, my gosh.

00:38:15.620 --> 00:38:17.820
 But he did win the tree-hugging contest

00:38:17.820 --> 00:38:19.340
 for three years in a row.

00:38:19.340 --> 00:38:28.420
 We're gonna move on to our final fact of the show,

00:38:28.420 --> 00:38:29.460
 and that is my fact.

00:38:29.460 --> 00:38:33.380
 My fact this week is that one way to tell how deep you are

00:38:33.380 --> 00:38:38.140
 when scuba diving is to take a set of snooker balls with you.

00:38:38.140 --> 00:38:41.180
 Is that 'cause you're at the bottom if you've done that?

00:38:41.180 --> 00:38:42.340
 You've sunk to the bottom.

00:38:42.340 --> 00:38:44.020
 Or is it because you're so fat

00:38:44.020 --> 00:38:46.140
 once you can't hear the snooker players going,

00:38:46.140 --> 00:38:48.060
 "Where you going with that balls?"

00:38:48.060 --> 00:38:49.220
 Then you know you're a certain number.

00:38:49.220 --> 00:38:50.100
 No, you're in trouble.

00:38:50.100 --> 00:38:52.420
 No, this is a fascinating thing that I didn't know,

00:38:52.420 --> 00:38:55.460
 which is that as you go lower into the ocean,

00:38:55.460 --> 00:38:57.580
 different bits of color disappear.

00:38:57.580 --> 00:39:00.540
 And so if you had no way of knowing how deep you are,

00:39:00.540 --> 00:39:02.900
 you can consult your snooker balls,

00:39:02.900 --> 00:39:06.220
 and if you can see that your red ball is no longer red,

00:39:06.220 --> 00:39:08.500
 that your yellow ball is no longer yellow,

00:39:08.500 --> 00:39:10.140
 but your green ball is still green,

00:39:10.140 --> 00:39:12.980
 then you know that you're roughly where you are in the ocean.

00:39:12.980 --> 00:39:14.740
 It is genius, Anna, I must say.

00:39:14.740 --> 00:39:16.060
 Fascinating, so this is...

00:39:16.060 --> 00:39:18.260
 It's very inconvenient to have to take a set of snooker balls.

00:39:18.260 --> 00:39:19.700
 No, no, no, Anna.

00:39:19.700 --> 00:39:22.100
 Oh, contraire, because I looked,

00:39:22.100 --> 00:39:26.180
 and the cheapest depth gauge you can get online is £30,

00:39:26.180 --> 00:39:29.460
 but the cheapest set of snooker balls is only £15.

00:39:29.460 --> 00:39:31.460
 There you go. I'll take it back.

00:39:31.460 --> 00:39:33.660
 What if you drop one, and then...

00:39:33.660 --> 00:39:36.220
 You better hope it's a red one.

00:39:36.220 --> 00:39:39.580
 But, like, how will you know what color they are?

00:39:39.580 --> 00:39:41.900
 Because you can still see the colors.

00:39:41.900 --> 00:39:44.180
 So, okay, so say you're going down, say you're going down.

00:39:44.180 --> 00:39:46.820
 At about 20 feet, red stops being red.

00:39:46.820 --> 00:39:49.340
 Okay, so you know all the red balls look grey.

00:39:49.340 --> 00:39:52.820
 Yes, exactly, so you're like, "Ah, I must be about 20 feet down."

00:39:52.820 --> 00:39:55.940
 You go down to 50 feet, orange disappears altogether.

00:39:55.940 --> 00:39:57.700
 "Oh, I must be at 50 feet."

00:39:57.700 --> 00:40:01.060
 You keep going down. "Where's yellow gone? I'm 100 feet deep."

00:40:01.060 --> 00:40:04.660
 So the more you go down, color starts disappearing.

00:40:04.660 --> 00:40:08.540
 And it's fascinating. So, for example, if you were, let's say,

00:40:08.540 --> 00:40:11.900
 50 feet below the ocean, maybe even 100,

00:40:11.900 --> 00:40:15.060
 and you cut yourself, you would bleed green blood,

00:40:15.060 --> 00:40:17.740
 because that color would be morphing towards...

00:40:17.740 --> 00:40:21.300
 So, people... I think it's quite, I think it's even just, like, 10 meters.

00:40:21.300 --> 00:40:23.820
 Because red disappears very fast. Red is a shit color.

00:40:23.820 --> 00:40:27.620
 It's got no energy. It sees one bit of water and disappears into it.

00:40:27.620 --> 00:40:29.980
 And I think on diving websites, it says, like,

00:40:29.980 --> 00:40:33.100
 early scuba divers, if they cut themselves, can get quite shocked,

00:40:33.100 --> 00:40:36.820
 because you're eight meters underwater and you go, "I'm an alien!"

00:40:36.820 --> 00:40:39.140
 But this is the amazing thing.

00:40:39.140 --> 00:40:43.820
 This is why so many fish red, because loads of fish are red,

00:40:43.820 --> 00:40:45.980
 and they're doing it in the deep sea, loads of fish are red,

00:40:45.980 --> 00:40:49.020
 and it's for camouflage, because you can't see red at that depth.

00:40:49.020 --> 00:40:51.740
 So they look grey or black, all the red light has been absorbed.

00:40:51.740 --> 00:40:53.300
 They're basically invisible.

00:40:53.300 --> 00:40:56.620
 But blue is the color that lasts the longest and penetrates the best.

00:40:56.620 --> 00:40:59.300
 So there are very few animals which have big blue bodies.

00:40:59.300 --> 00:41:02.020
 The blue whale is basically so confident.

00:41:02.020 --> 00:41:03.340
 Like, they're none predators.

00:41:03.340 --> 00:41:06.220
 But in the reefs, you get, like, blue and yellow fish, don't you?

00:41:06.220 --> 00:41:08.540
 And the reason is that they want to signal where they are

00:41:08.540 --> 00:41:12.300
 for sexual reasons or something like that, or scare things away.

00:41:12.300 --> 00:41:15.060
 And yellow is the complementary color to blue.

00:41:15.060 --> 00:41:17.900
 So the complementary color to red is green.

00:41:17.900 --> 00:41:19.700
 They really contrast against each other.

00:41:19.700 --> 00:41:21.500
 The complementary color to blue is yellow.

00:41:21.500 --> 00:41:23.860
 So that's why you get lots of blue and yellow fish.

00:41:23.860 --> 00:41:29.380
 But also it means if there were traffic lights in the fish world,

00:41:29.380 --> 00:41:31.340
 there would be no use being red and green,

00:41:31.340 --> 00:41:33.500
 because the red would disappear straight away.

00:41:33.500 --> 00:41:36.740
 They would have to be blue, which is the thing that stands out the most.

00:41:36.740 --> 00:41:39.220
 So the red light would be blue,

00:41:39.220 --> 00:41:41.380
 and the green light would be the complementary color to that,

00:41:41.380 --> 00:41:43.740
 which would be yellow.

00:41:43.740 --> 00:41:46.940
 And if you look at Spongebob Squarepants, they get it wrong.

00:41:46.940 --> 00:41:49.260
 [LAUGHTER]

00:41:49.260 --> 00:41:51.420
 I should quickly say where I got this fact from,

00:41:51.420 --> 00:41:54.020
 because I was reading a novel when we were on tour.

00:41:54.020 --> 00:41:56.780
 We were in Dublin, and I bought this book on the way over,

00:41:56.780 --> 00:41:59.660
 which was "Wailfall" by Daniel Krause.

00:41:59.660 --> 00:42:04.100
 It's a science fiction book, so it's all fictional, but this was in it.

00:42:04.100 --> 00:42:07.340
 And it's the story of a guy who's going scuba diving,

00:42:07.340 --> 00:42:10.020
 and he's accidentally swallowed by a whale.

00:42:10.020 --> 00:42:13.620
 And while he's in the whale, he's still got the scuba gear on him,

00:42:13.620 --> 00:42:15.420
 so he makes it into one of the stomachs,

00:42:15.420 --> 00:42:17.660
 and he knows he has an hour of oxygen left,

00:42:17.660 --> 00:42:21.820
 and it's the story of how he attempts to get out of the whale within an hour.

00:42:21.820 --> 00:42:23.500
 It's one of those books. It's like the Martian...

00:42:23.500 --> 00:42:27.940
 It's proper science trying to work out how to not be digested in a whale stomach.

00:42:27.940 --> 00:42:30.100
 I learned so much despite it being fiction.

00:42:30.100 --> 00:42:33.580
 I know, for example, if you do get swallowed by a whale and you're in its stomach,

00:42:33.580 --> 00:42:35.540
 don't try to escape via the anus.

00:42:35.540 --> 00:42:36.780
 Not going to work for you.

00:42:36.780 --> 00:42:38.340
 You need to go back out the other way.

00:42:38.340 --> 00:42:40.620
 I'm not going to say whether or not he makes it out, but don't do that.

00:42:40.620 --> 00:42:41.940
 Does he try the anus?

00:42:41.940 --> 00:42:43.420
 He does. His initial thought is,

00:42:43.420 --> 00:42:45.860
 "I need to just go all the way out through the end."

00:42:45.860 --> 00:42:47.540
 This guy sounds like an idiot.

00:42:47.540 --> 00:42:48.820
 Well, I think when you're inside...

00:42:48.820 --> 00:42:49.860
 Wait, what's wrong with that?

00:42:49.860 --> 00:42:52.380
 What, because you get digested by the digestive juices?

00:42:52.380 --> 00:42:53.180
 It feels like...

00:42:53.180 --> 00:42:55.940
 What does he discover as a scientifically incorrect reason?

00:42:55.940 --> 00:42:58.620
 One thing is that a whale doesn't want to eat you.

00:42:58.620 --> 00:43:01.620
 It wants you out of it. It's not a nice thing for them.

00:43:01.620 --> 00:43:05.180
 You can see inside a whale because largely it swallows bioluminescence,

00:43:05.180 --> 00:43:08.220
 so actually, you can get sight inside a whale.

00:43:08.220 --> 00:43:09.980
 What you mean it swallows stuff that's bioluminescence?

00:43:09.980 --> 00:43:13.660
 Yeah, exactly. So, it might swallow an octopus that has bioluminescence attached to it,

00:43:13.660 --> 00:43:15.060
 so you can use that as a torch.

00:43:15.060 --> 00:43:18.300
 You can use an octopus as a torch inside a stomach.

00:43:18.300 --> 00:43:20.620
 Oh, my God, I've lost a snooker ball.

00:43:20.620 --> 00:43:26.740
 Did you get 90% of animals in the ocean glow in the dark?

00:43:26.740 --> 00:43:29.180
 Which makes sense because, as we say, all colours go away,

00:43:29.180 --> 00:43:31.540
 so they have to make their own colour.

00:43:31.540 --> 00:43:35.580
 But 90% have fluorescent colours that show up.

00:43:35.580 --> 00:43:37.380
 And as we say, if you don't have fluorescent colours

00:43:37.380 --> 00:43:39.340
 and you want to disguise yourself in your prey,

00:43:39.340 --> 00:43:41.940
 then you're often red or black.

00:43:41.940 --> 00:43:45.540
 But that becomes a problem if you meet a dragonfish,

00:43:45.540 --> 00:43:48.540
 which is the only fish that can actually generate red light.

00:43:48.540 --> 00:43:52.020
 So, the dragonfish knows that it's so deep down

00:43:52.020 --> 00:43:55.060
 that red light can't penetrate, so it brings its own.

00:43:55.060 --> 00:43:58.700
 And it's got these headlights under its eyes,

00:43:58.700 --> 00:44:02.100
 kind of like wall paint, and they flash red.

00:44:02.100 --> 00:44:04.980
 And so, as soon as they land on a fish that's red,

00:44:04.980 --> 00:44:08.260
 that thinks it's completely invisible, it shows up red.

00:44:08.260 --> 00:44:11.380
 The only problem is that red doesn't travel very far in water,

00:44:11.380 --> 00:44:15.540
 so they have to get literally centimetres away from the prey.

00:44:15.540 --> 00:44:17.500
 But they basically have a...

00:44:17.500 --> 00:44:19.780
 They effectively have an invisible torch.

00:44:19.780 --> 00:44:21.860
 Because nothing else can see the red. Nothing else can see it.

00:44:21.860 --> 00:44:24.340
 Only they can see what they're trying to do.

00:44:24.340 --> 00:44:27.700
 Like one of those blue light things that you get, like UV torches, right?

00:44:27.700 --> 00:44:30.020
 Like that. They're very cool.

00:44:30.020 --> 00:44:32.180
 But they can't have an eye test,

00:44:32.180 --> 00:44:34.940
 because if you bring them to the surface, they will explode.

00:44:34.940 --> 00:44:38.380
 LAUGHTER

00:44:38.380 --> 00:44:40.660
 Now, if you could just read the first...

00:44:40.660 --> 00:44:41.980
 Oh, what was that?

00:44:41.980 --> 00:44:45.420
 That's so funny.

00:44:45.420 --> 00:44:49.180
 On sea colour, colour in the sea,

00:44:49.180 --> 00:44:51.100
 oceans used to be pink.

00:44:51.100 --> 00:44:53.420
 And, in fact, the whole world was pink.

00:44:53.420 --> 00:44:54.860
 Is that like a bacteria thing?

00:44:54.860 --> 00:44:57.420
 It is a bacteria thing. Yes.

00:44:57.420 --> 00:44:59.340
 Good guess, Dan.

00:44:59.340 --> 00:45:01.220
 10 points.

00:45:01.220 --> 00:45:02.980
 I'm the only member of this family that gets marked

00:45:02.980 --> 00:45:05.780
 when they say something remotely correct.

00:45:05.780 --> 00:45:07.900
 Well done, you have a star.

00:45:07.900 --> 00:45:10.100
 And how many marks are you up to after 10 years?

00:45:10.100 --> 00:45:13.700
 This is my first one, but it's a good feeling.

00:45:13.700 --> 00:45:15.140
 It's improvement.

00:45:15.140 --> 00:45:17.100
 And this is the revelation quite recently

00:45:17.100 --> 00:45:19.220
 that the world's oldest colour is pink.

00:45:19.220 --> 00:45:22.900
 And this is from researchers who found ancient pink pigments

00:45:22.900 --> 00:45:25.740
 in rocks that were 1.1 billion years old.

00:45:25.740 --> 00:45:28.900
 And so they were over 500 million years older

00:45:28.900 --> 00:45:30.860
 than the second oldest known pigment.

00:45:30.860 --> 00:45:33.020
 And they're fossils of chlorophyll.

00:45:33.020 --> 00:45:35.940
 But back in the day, really back in the day then,

00:45:35.940 --> 00:45:39.020
 chlorophyll is now green, that's what makes plants green.

00:45:39.020 --> 00:45:40.860
 But back then, it was pink.

00:45:40.860 --> 00:45:43.020
 And it was this pink produced by ancient bacteria.

00:45:43.020 --> 00:45:44.540
 And that was all there was.

00:45:44.540 --> 00:45:46.620
 And that was what the oceans were full of.

00:45:46.620 --> 00:45:48.780
 And so the whole world was pink.

00:45:48.780 --> 00:45:51.900
 Barbie's world was 1.1 billion years ago.

00:45:51.900 --> 00:45:55.100
 You knew she was old-fashioned, but...

00:45:55.100 --> 00:45:57.220
 Have you guys heard of yum, yum, yellow?

00:45:57.220 --> 00:45:58.420
 Yum, yum, yum, yellow.

00:45:58.420 --> 00:45:59.660
 Yum, yum, yellow.

00:45:59.660 --> 00:46:03.900
 No. Is it the yellow of that mustard yellow

00:46:03.900 --> 00:46:06.780
 that is meant to make us think it's delicious, whatever it is?

00:46:06.780 --> 00:46:08.620
 Um, no.

00:46:08.620 --> 00:46:10.300
 Is it sea-based? Is it sponge-bog?

00:46:10.300 --> 00:46:12.380
 It's sea-based. Is it a starfish?

00:46:12.380 --> 00:46:14.780
 It's not. What have I already said about yellow?

00:46:14.780 --> 00:46:16.380
 The yellow and blue fish on the reefs?

00:46:16.380 --> 00:46:20.140
 Yes. So yellow is very easy to see under water.

00:46:20.140 --> 00:46:23.100
 And there is a theory that if you're wearing yum, yum, yellow

00:46:23.100 --> 00:46:24.300
 when you're scuba diving,

00:46:24.300 --> 00:46:26.820
 you're more likely to get eaten by sharks.

00:46:26.820 --> 00:46:27.820
 Oh!

00:46:27.820 --> 00:46:30.060
 And scuba divers will talk about this,

00:46:30.060 --> 00:46:32.940
 and they'll say you should never wear yum, yum, yellow.

00:46:32.940 --> 00:46:34.860
 It comes from early...

00:46:34.860 --> 00:46:38.620
 In the World War II, there was a lot of incidents in the Pacific

00:46:38.620 --> 00:46:41.500
 where US Navy people would end up in the water

00:46:41.500 --> 00:46:43.740
 and they'd get eaten by sharks and stuff like that.

00:46:43.740 --> 00:46:45.580
 It comes from that originally.

00:46:45.580 --> 00:46:47.580
 And we're not really sure whether it...

00:46:47.580 --> 00:46:50.540
 Not it's true that sharks do go for yellow.

00:46:50.540 --> 00:46:52.460
 Are we saying people aren't willing to test this?

00:46:52.460 --> 00:46:56.140
 Well, it seems theoretical that it's true.

00:46:56.140 --> 00:46:58.300
 But the international shark attack file said,

00:46:58.300 --> 00:47:01.420
 "The benefit of increasing one's chances of being rescued

00:47:01.420 --> 00:47:04.620
 far outweighs the minimal risk of attracting a shark."

00:47:04.620 --> 00:47:07.180
 So the thing is, if you're yellow, people will be able to see you

00:47:07.180 --> 00:47:08.300
 and be able to rescue you.

00:47:08.300 --> 00:47:11.900
 There was a person called Valerie Taylor who invented a wetsuit

00:47:11.900 --> 00:47:15.740
 which had the same markings as sea snakes,

00:47:15.740 --> 00:47:18.700
 because grey-white sharks don't like sea snakes.

00:47:18.700 --> 00:47:20.620
 And the theory was that they would see you

00:47:20.620 --> 00:47:23.020
 and think you were a snake and then would swim away.

00:47:23.020 --> 00:47:24.700
 And it's a really good theory.

00:47:24.700 --> 00:47:26.220
 -The only problem... -She got eaten.

00:47:26.220 --> 00:47:29.420
 Well, tiger sharks are keen predators of sea snakes.

00:47:29.420 --> 00:47:30.860
 Oh, no!

00:47:30.860 --> 00:47:33.100
 So it does save you from the great wikes,

00:47:33.100 --> 00:47:35.180
 but the tigers will still get you.

00:47:35.180 --> 00:47:37.660
 Do you know, that's a new thing, sea snakes.

00:47:37.660 --> 00:47:41.100
 In 2021, a report was done by a scuba diver

00:47:41.100 --> 00:47:43.580
 who noticed that every time he was going into the water,

00:47:43.580 --> 00:47:45.820
 sea snakes were trying to shag him.

00:47:45.820 --> 00:47:48.220
 And it was because they can't really see.

00:47:48.220 --> 00:47:49.820
 The only way they can know properly

00:47:49.820 --> 00:47:52.300
 what they are going to be eating is by tasting it.

00:47:52.300 --> 00:47:54.380
 So they wrap themselves around the legs

00:47:54.380 --> 00:47:56.700
 and the torsos of scuba divers,

00:47:56.700 --> 00:47:58.700
 and they start licking them and then going,

00:47:58.700 --> 00:48:01.260
 "Oh, no, this is not a sea snake."

00:48:01.260 --> 00:48:02.220
 But this...

00:48:02.220 --> 00:48:03.340
 Wait, do they want to...

00:48:03.340 --> 00:48:05.500
 Are they testing if they want to eat it or shag it, sorry?

00:48:05.500 --> 00:48:08.220
 So it's mating season, and because they can't see,

00:48:08.220 --> 00:48:10.300
 basically in order to know what they're dealing with,

00:48:10.300 --> 00:48:11.500
 they need to lick it.

00:48:11.500 --> 00:48:13.420
 And that's not good.

00:48:13.420 --> 00:48:16.620
 The other thing with sea snakes is the way of cutting

00:48:16.620 --> 00:48:19.260
 is the male will go up and look for a female,

00:48:19.260 --> 00:48:21.660
 and then the female will swim away.

00:48:21.660 --> 00:48:24.380
 And so if you're a diver and the load of sea snakes

00:48:24.380 --> 00:48:27.020
 come up to you and you swim off away from them,

00:48:27.020 --> 00:48:28.940
 they think you're playing hard to get.

00:48:28.940 --> 00:48:30.220
 Yeah.

00:48:30.220 --> 00:48:32.540
 So apparently the best thing to do is just go to the bottom

00:48:32.540 --> 00:48:35.100
 of the reef and just let them...

00:48:35.100 --> 00:48:35.980
 Let them go?

00:48:35.980 --> 00:48:37.020
 Let them have a go.

00:48:37.020 --> 00:48:37.660
 All right.

00:48:37.660 --> 00:48:39.020
 And soon they'll realize

00:48:39.020 --> 00:48:40.860
 that you're not a sea snake and bugger off.

00:48:40.860 --> 00:48:42.140
 Yeah. Wow.

00:48:42.140 --> 00:48:45.580
 There was a study recently of a body of water,

00:48:45.580 --> 00:48:47.100
 a body of water that one of us loves more

00:48:47.100 --> 00:48:49.020
 than any other in the world.

00:48:49.020 --> 00:48:51.100
 Oh, gosh, I don't have a favourite

00:48:51.100 --> 00:48:52.380
 body of water, I don't think.

00:48:52.380 --> 00:48:54.220
 Dan, you've been there looking for a...

00:48:54.220 --> 00:48:55.180
 Oh, Loch Ness.

00:48:55.180 --> 00:48:57.420
 Oh, Loch Ness, right.

00:48:57.420 --> 00:49:00.380
 There was a theory that maybe, just maybe,

00:49:00.380 --> 00:49:05.020
 a very, very big eel might be the Loch Ness monster,

00:49:05.020 --> 00:49:07.100
 like a six metre long eel.

00:49:07.100 --> 00:49:08.780
 Carl Sagan, great scientist,

00:49:08.780 --> 00:49:11.100
 admittedly more of space than of water,

00:49:11.100 --> 00:49:13.980
 thought that there could be 310 metre eels living there.

00:49:13.980 --> 00:49:14.940
 And if they all teamed up,

00:49:14.940 --> 00:49:18.460
 they could look very convincingly like the Loch Ness monster.

00:49:19.180 --> 00:49:21.820
 And there was a study, a sort of troll of the DNA in the water,

00:49:21.820 --> 00:49:24.220
 and they found huge amounts of eel DNA.

00:49:24.220 --> 00:49:25.340
 And so, right, we're on a winner.

00:49:25.340 --> 00:49:27.420
 Like, maybe the Loch Ness monster

00:49:27.420 --> 00:49:30.140
 is actually just a load of eels.

00:49:30.140 --> 00:49:32.220
 But unfortunately, the latest thinking

00:49:32.220 --> 00:49:34.860
 is that probably there are not giant eels living there.

00:49:34.860 --> 00:49:37.100
 Because the maximum length of a European eel,

00:49:37.100 --> 00:49:38.300
 as I don't need to remind you guys,

00:49:38.300 --> 00:49:39.820
 is about 0.9 metres long.

00:49:39.820 --> 00:49:43.820
 The odds of finding a six metre eel are very slim.

00:49:43.820 --> 00:49:46.220
 But that just means six ties more of them

00:49:46.220 --> 00:49:48.860
 need to get together to pretend to be a Loch Ness monster, right?

00:49:48.860 --> 00:49:51.420
 Yeah, they just need to buy a bigger trenchcoat.

00:49:51.420 --> 00:49:55.740
 Yeah, well, so maybe, maybe that's it.

00:49:55.740 --> 00:49:58.300
 Quite a cool thing related to Dan's original fact

00:49:58.300 --> 00:50:01.660
 about wavelengths travelling different amounts underwater.

00:50:01.660 --> 00:50:03.180
 You know when it's been a hot sunny day,

00:50:03.180 --> 00:50:04.540
 and you think, oh, I'll get in the river

00:50:04.540 --> 00:50:05.820
 because it's a nice hot sunny day,

00:50:05.820 --> 00:50:07.180
 and you put your toe in and it's like,

00:50:07.180 --> 00:50:09.020
 oh, the water's so warm and nice.

00:50:09.020 --> 00:50:10.540
 And then you put your full foot in,

00:50:10.540 --> 00:50:13.500
 it's fucking freezing underneath that.

00:50:13.500 --> 00:50:16.300
 That is because in the electromagnetic spectrum,

00:50:16.300 --> 00:50:17.500
 which you'll remember from school,

00:50:17.500 --> 00:50:21.500
 infrared waves have an even longer wavelength than red,

00:50:21.500 --> 00:50:23.500
 and they're the ones that we get heat from.

00:50:23.500 --> 00:50:25.340
 And so when they come from the sun,

00:50:25.340 --> 00:50:27.020
 the heat lands in the water

00:50:27.020 --> 00:50:28.940
 and immediately spreads on the surface

00:50:28.940 --> 00:50:31.180
 and it only gets 10 centimetres down max.

00:50:31.180 --> 00:50:32.380
 So that's why, I mean, obviously,

00:50:32.380 --> 00:50:34.220
 then it does mix in a bit because it's liquid,

00:50:34.220 --> 00:50:36.460
 but that is why when you put your foot in the water

00:50:36.460 --> 00:50:37.900
 and you think, lovely.

00:50:37.900 --> 00:50:38.460
 Yeah.

00:50:38.460 --> 00:50:39.660
 Yeah, then...

00:50:39.660 --> 00:50:42.060
 Interestingly, that's the same with trees, right?

00:50:42.060 --> 00:50:42.860
 So if you...

00:50:42.860 --> 00:50:43.420
 Oh, here we go.

00:50:43.420 --> 00:50:45.020
 God, it all comes back to that, please.

00:50:45.020 --> 00:50:45.740
 No, no, it's true.

00:50:45.740 --> 00:50:49.660
 If you hug, wrap your arms around the lower trunk of daddy

00:50:49.660 --> 00:50:51.820
 and you're going to have a colder experience.

00:50:51.820 --> 00:50:53.980
 So they found this out with koalas, basically.

00:50:53.980 --> 00:50:55.020
 It's a very similar thing,

00:50:55.020 --> 00:50:57.740
 which is that koalas, when it gets really hot,

00:50:57.740 --> 00:51:00.940
 they travel down a tree and they hug a tree much lower

00:51:00.940 --> 00:51:04.460
 and they did scans on the tree to see the heat signals.

00:51:04.460 --> 00:51:06.860
 On a lower bit of a tree, it's always colder.

00:51:06.860 --> 00:51:08.540
 So they're regulating themselves

00:51:08.540 --> 00:51:10.220
 because they don't sweat koalas.

00:51:10.220 --> 00:51:13.500
 They have to sort of lick out the wetness out of them.

00:51:15.100 --> 00:51:17.660
 They lick themselves and they're not evaporated

00:51:17.660 --> 00:51:18.700
 and takes away the heat.

00:51:18.700 --> 00:51:21.020
 I mean, that's a different way of saying it.

00:51:21.020 --> 00:51:25.260
 They don't have to suck their own sweat out.

00:51:25.260 --> 00:51:29.180
 But this thing actually about the koalas is interesting

00:51:29.180 --> 00:51:31.020
 because that study was done a few years ago, right?

00:51:31.020 --> 00:51:32.940
 And they wondered if anyone else did it

00:51:32.940 --> 00:51:34.780
 and they found that there's a type of lima

00:51:34.780 --> 00:51:36.300
 called the white sifaka.

00:51:36.300 --> 00:51:40.220
 And they do the same thing in Madagascar.

00:51:40.220 --> 00:51:41.980
 And the amazing thing about that,

00:51:41.980 --> 00:51:44.700
 they hug the trees because they want to get cool.

00:51:45.020 --> 00:51:46.620
 Because the water comes up from below,

00:51:46.620 --> 00:51:48.460
 it's a little bit cooler, it can keep them cool.

00:51:48.460 --> 00:51:51.820
 And what they found out is that they never do it

00:51:51.820 --> 00:51:54.220
 until the temperature gets to 30 degrees.

00:51:54.220 --> 00:51:56.780
 And then for each one degree increase,

00:51:56.780 --> 00:51:59.580
 it doubles the chances of the limas going there.

00:51:59.580 --> 00:52:01.500
 So it means that if you're in Madagascar

00:52:01.500 --> 00:52:03.340
 and you don't have a thermometer with you,

00:52:03.340 --> 00:52:06.220
 all you have to do is count the number of limas

00:52:06.220 --> 00:52:07.740
 who are around the trunk.

00:52:07.740 --> 00:52:09.180
 And that'll tell you what the temperature is.

00:52:09.180 --> 00:52:09.900
 That's incredible.

00:52:09.900 --> 00:52:11.740
 That's amazing.

00:52:11.740 --> 00:52:12.940
 Guys, we're going to have to wrap up.

00:52:12.940 --> 00:52:14.060
 That's so good.

00:52:14.060 --> 00:52:16.140
 And do you know what kind of TV dolphins like?

00:52:16.140 --> 00:52:19.420
 Well, we're talking about seeing things underwater.

00:52:19.420 --> 00:52:20.860
 It won't be flipper-eyed.

00:52:20.860 --> 00:52:22.860
 It won't be stuff that they're in.

00:52:22.860 --> 00:52:26.620
 Well, I don't really like to watch things that I'm in.

00:52:26.620 --> 00:52:30.060
 What do dolphins like?

00:52:30.060 --> 00:52:32.140
 They love fish to eat fish.

00:52:32.140 --> 00:52:33.340
 Reality stuff.

00:52:33.340 --> 00:52:34.700
 Reality shows.

00:52:34.700 --> 00:52:34.940
 Yeah.

00:52:34.940 --> 00:52:38.700
 Well, some scientists showed some bottle noses,

00:52:38.700 --> 00:52:41.180
 Planet Earth and SpongeBob SquarePants.

00:52:41.740 --> 00:52:46.300
 And tried to see whether they prefer real life underwater scenes

00:52:46.300 --> 00:52:49.100
 or ones where they stupidly get the traffic lights wrong.

00:52:49.100 --> 00:52:53.180
 And it turns out that actually dolphins are interested

00:52:53.180 --> 00:52:55.260
 in all TV shows no matter what is on.

00:52:55.260 --> 00:52:57.420
 I knew they were stupid.

00:52:57.420 --> 00:53:01.020
 Although male dolphins slightly preferred

00:53:01.020 --> 00:53:03.180
 to watch videos of female dolphins.

00:53:03.180 --> 00:53:05.500
 OK.

00:53:05.500 --> 00:53:09.580
 Just like your average British man at the end of any day, really.

00:53:09.580 --> 00:53:10.860
 I'll watch anything.

00:53:10.860 --> 00:53:13.420
 Mildly prefer it if there's a female in it.

00:53:13.420 --> 00:53:13.900
 Good on him.

00:53:13.900 --> 00:53:17.260
 Lovely thought to end on.

00:53:17.260 --> 00:53:19.660
 I've got that right.

00:53:19.660 --> 00:53:20.300
 That makes you think.

00:53:20.300 --> 00:53:24.380
 Meanwhile, Dan's watching Forestry Live 24 hours a day.

00:53:24.380 --> 00:53:32.140
 OK, everyone.

00:53:32.140 --> 00:53:32.940
 That is it.

00:53:32.940 --> 00:53:33.820
 That is our facts.

00:53:33.820 --> 00:53:35.420

00:53:53.900 --> 00:53:57.260
