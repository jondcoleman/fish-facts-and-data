00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:19.680
 Hello and welcome to another episode of No Such Thing as a Fish, a weekly podcast coming

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:24.520
 to you from four undisclosed locations in the UK.

00:00:24.520 --> 00:00:28.880
 My name is Dan Schreiber, I am sitting here with Anna Tejinski, Andrew Hunter Murray and

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:32.880
 James Harkin and once again we have gathered round the microphones with our four favourite

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:37.960
 facts from the last seven days and in no particular order, here we go.

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:41.880
 Starting with fact number one and that is my fact, my fact this week is that the London

00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:45.600
 Underground used to have a church interval on Sundays.

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:46.600
 Wow.

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:51.980
 Yeah, it respected the church, it would stop services during church times.

00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:55.320
 Stop services so that you could have a service.

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:57.320
 Very nice and we're off.

00:00:57.320 --> 00:01:05.240
 It's a bumpy start but at least we're moving.

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:08.920
 If you were halfway between stations, would it just stop underground and you're trapped

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:11.440
 there having to worship God from the subterranean?

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:13.760
 That's such a good point, I don't know.

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:17.400
 I did find a thing called the London Underground Church and I thought, oh great, there's going

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:20.200
 to be a church down there but apparently it was a political movement, it was a sort

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:23.220
 of like underground in the sense that it wasn't allowed to be known.

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:27.280
 So it was a couple of hours on a Sunday so people could go to church.

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:32.800
 Yeah, it was 11 a.m. to 1 p.m. roughly and this is a thing that has existed for a very

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:33.800
 long time.

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:39.120
 So the London Underground, very, very old, the first line opened in 1863 just to put

00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:44.520
 in context, nine days before that Abraham Lincoln signed the Emancipation Proclamation

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:45.520
 in America.

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:46.520
 Wow.

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:49.720
 Just to put it in context of how old this is.

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:54.440
 Interestingly though Dan, I know how old the London Underground is, better than I know

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:58.640
 when the Proclamation was signed so it didn't really help me that much.

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:00.360
 I think that was more for American listeners.

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:01.360
 Got it.

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:02.360
 Yeah.

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:03.360
 Got it.

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:08.360
 Yeah and it's, so there was a big thing where you had to respect a lot of the church during

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:12.200
 those times and one of the things was transport also had to do that and that extended to the

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:16.920
 London Underground and that extended all the way till 1900 when I think it was the central

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:24.280
 line, was the first line that didn't abide by the church interval and interestingly, famous

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:27.080
 celebrity on the first central line ride.

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:29.760
 Oh, wait, did you know what year it was?

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:30.760
 1900.

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:35.120
 Oh, who was famous in 1900 who we would have heard of today, Gladstone.

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:39.000
 It was, this is again for the American listeners, it was an American visiting.

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:40.840
 Oh, Charlie Chaplin.

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:42.280
 Who is British but that's cool.

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:43.280
 Yep.

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:44.280
 Got it.

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:45.280
 Cool.

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:46.280
 What about Edison?

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:47.280
 No, not Edison.

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:49.120
 I mean, it's going to be too hard to get.

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:50.120
 Henry Ford.

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:51.120
 No, not Henry Ford.

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:52.120
 No.

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:55.840
 It's the Graham Bell, who I appreciate was Scottish, British, spent a lot of his career

00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:56.840
 in America.

00:02:56.840 --> 00:03:01.200
 Alana Sparassette, who is Canadian but a lot of people think she's American.

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:05.600
 She's North America, wasn't she?

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:08.480
 Is it Freddie Mercury, who was born in Zanzibar?

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:12.480
 Ah, very nice.

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:14.720
 So we need someone who was alive in 1900.

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:15.720
 Let's start with that.

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:16.720
 Oh, you're still making his guess.

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:17.720
 You're not just going to tell us.

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:18.720
 I've been waiting to tell.

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:19.720
 There's so many.

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:20.720
 A silent movie star.

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:21.720
 A silent movie star.

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:22.720
 Okay.

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:23.720
 It was an author.

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:24.720
 Hemingway.

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:25.720
 An American author.

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:26.720
 Yeah.

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:27.720
 Again, 1900, Anna.

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:28.720
 Yeah.

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:29.720
 He would have been very young.

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:30.720
 He'd have been a top.

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:31.720
 He would have been very young.

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:32.720
 Yeah, but.

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:33.720
 He got up for free.

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:35.720
 They just carried him over the barriers.

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:36.720
 It was fine.

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:41.280
 Hemingway could have been a little two-year-old on holiday in Britain at the time.

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:42.280
 That's true.

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:44.720
 We wouldn't, Dan, put us out.

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:45.720
 Mark Twain.

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:46.720
 Everybody's misery.

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:47.720
 It was Mark Twain.

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:48.720
 Yes.

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:49.720
 Yes.

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:50.720
 Wow.

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:52.720
 Do we nobody thought of it?

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:56.560
 I didn't actually, no, I didn't actually find, but we do know what the Daily Mail reported

00:03:56.560 --> 00:03:57.560
 about us.

00:03:57.560 --> 00:04:02.200
 It said, "Verocious curiosity, astonished satisfaction and solid merit.

00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:06.560
 If this kind of thing goes on, London will come to be quite a nice place to travel in.

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:11.800
 The conductor was all a quiver of joy and pride, but there was no indecorous exhibition

00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:13.120
 of emotion.

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:15.440
 Every man was solidly British."

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:20.240
 These early breaks, though, or these rather, these kind of Sunday trading rules, a lot

00:04:20.240 --> 00:04:24.240
 of it, I think, because there used to be trains every day.

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:28.880
 They used to be Christmas Day Expresses, and then a lot of the trains had to be axed on

00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:32.840
 Sundays partly because of religion, but that was a bit of an excuse, really, because a

00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:34.880
 lot of it was down to economics.

00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:38.040
 The fact was there was this thing called the Railway Mania, which sounds like an amazing

00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:43.400
 time in Britain's history, where every person in the country was invested in or actively

00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:48.320
 building a railway. And they got all the thousands of railways across the country. And most of

00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:52.520
 them didn't make any money because they didn't have any passengers. And this was an easy thing

00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:57.520
 to act with Sunday trains. And companies were needing to save money in the 1860s. And these

00:04:57.520 --> 00:04:59.760
 were lightly used trains. They were an obvious target.

00:04:59.760 --> 00:05:04.720
 Yeah. It's a bit like, remember when they opened up directory inquiries and you had

00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:11.240
 all those different 118 numbers, like 118, 118, or 118, 888, or 118, 111, or 118, 222,

00:05:11.240 --> 00:05:15.000
 or whatever. It was like, they opened this thing up for anyone with a little bit of money

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:19.320
 to think, I can make something big there. And everyone came in and then of course, most

00:05:19.320 --> 00:05:20.640
 of them just died out.

00:05:20.640 --> 00:05:23.040
 But what were the things that you could ring and ask?

00:05:23.040 --> 00:05:25.960
 Like, what is Andy's phone number?

00:05:25.960 --> 00:05:28.960
 I hope no one would tell you that. I hope the only people who could tell you that would

00:05:28.960 --> 00:05:31.360
 be me with my phone number and you have no idea already.

00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:34.520
 Well, it's interesting you should say that, Andy, because in the olden days, which you

00:05:34.520 --> 00:05:38.480
 won't remember, there used to be phone books that had everyone's phone numbers in them.

00:05:38.480 --> 00:05:41.920
 I'd be ex-directory. They let you take yourself off though.

00:05:41.920 --> 00:05:45.080
 They let you take yourself off. Yeah. And if I rang up and said, what's Andy's phone

00:05:45.080 --> 00:05:49.080
 number? This is back in the day and you take it and you're taking yourself off. They say,

00:05:49.080 --> 00:05:50.080
 oh, he's taken himself off.

00:05:50.080 --> 00:05:54.880
 My mum definitely still does 118, or she certainly was a couple of years ago. She would ring

00:05:54.880 --> 00:05:57.840
 up for someone's number and you don't want to be ex-directory because they were always

00:05:57.840 --> 00:06:03.040
 pricks if you remember. It was always either your parents were a doctor, which for some

00:06:03.040 --> 00:06:07.240
 reason was okay, or you're a bit of a dickhead.

00:06:07.240 --> 00:06:12.400
 On Sunday trading and Sunday hours and things like that, the history of Sunday trading in

00:06:12.400 --> 00:06:17.360
 Britain is very funny when you look into it. And did explain to me why still, if I ever

00:06:17.360 --> 00:06:21.240
 go out to buy something on a Sunday, my mum will say, well, I mean, the shops won't be

00:06:21.240 --> 00:06:27.120
 open. What are you doing? Because, so the Sunday shops act happened in 1950, which basically

00:06:27.120 --> 00:06:32.440
 said no shops except essentials can open on a Sunday because of church. And it was repealed

00:06:32.440 --> 00:06:38.040
 in 1994. But I was reading all these parliamentary debates in the interim, which showed how very

00:06:38.040 --> 00:06:42.160
 controversial it was because the rules were so convoluted. So for instance, you could

00:06:42.160 --> 00:06:48.040
 buy essentials. People acknowledged that perishables couldn't wait another day. So you could sell

00:06:48.040 --> 00:06:49.040
 vegetables.

00:06:49.040 --> 00:06:52.340
 So there were all these people, for instance, who would have furniture shops. There was

00:06:52.340 --> 00:06:58.880
 a case in 1972, Walla vs Hardy, where a furniture shop was selling carrots for £250 each. But

00:06:58.880 --> 00:07:04.840
 you've got a free item of furniture with your carrot as a free gift to get away with it.

00:07:04.840 --> 00:07:09.960
 There was this bizarre rule where fish and chip shops were specifically banned from selling

00:07:09.960 --> 00:07:14.480
 fish and chips on a Sunday. But anyone else could sell fish and chips. So a Chinese takeaway

00:07:14.480 --> 00:07:18.220
 could sell fish and chips, but a fish and chips shop couldn't. But a fish and chip shop

00:07:18.220 --> 00:07:23.120
 could sell a Chinese takeaway on a Sunday. It was wild.

00:07:23.120 --> 00:07:29.080
 There was a thing where you're not allowed to buy dog food, but if you said to the guy

00:07:29.080 --> 00:07:33.440
 of the shop, "I have a pony who only eats dog food," you're allowed to buy it because

00:07:33.440 --> 00:07:36.280
 you're allowed to buy pony food. And it didn't say...

00:07:36.280 --> 00:07:39.720
 Oh, because dogs are very religious, but I think horses aren't, are they?

00:07:39.720 --> 00:07:45.800
 That's right, yeah. That's insane. I found out about a sex shop in Cheshire called the

00:07:45.800 --> 00:07:52.000
 Private Shop. And in 2014, they were applying to be allowed to trade on a Sunday, right?

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:56.120
 And they were not allowed to do so, but they were granted permission to leave the door

00:07:56.120 --> 00:07:58.000
 slightly open. Right.

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:04.160
 But the thing is, I bought a carrot from there for $5.99, and they gave me a free dildo.

00:08:04.160 --> 00:08:10.400
 Well, that's two dildos for the price of one. That's great, yeah.

00:08:10.400 --> 00:08:18.160
 I'm not going round to y'alls for Sunday lunch.

00:08:18.160 --> 00:08:23.880
 In 1816 in Massachusetts, there was a guy who was called George Pierce, who was arrested

00:08:23.880 --> 00:08:27.760
 for riding on a Sunday, because in America, you weren't allowed to ride your horse on

00:08:27.760 --> 00:08:32.760
 a Sunday. He was arrested as acting against the peace and dignity of the Commonwealth of

00:08:32.760 --> 00:08:37.680
 Massachusetts, and he was put in prison, and then he was only let out on a Monday. But then

00:08:37.680 --> 00:08:41.960
 he sued the officer for false arrest because he said, "Yeah, you're not allowed to do anything

00:08:41.960 --> 00:08:49.620
 on Sundays, including arresting me." And he won his court case, and he got $500 of damages

00:08:49.620 --> 00:08:52.360
 from the police officer for arresting him.

00:08:52.360 --> 00:08:53.360
 Wow.

00:08:53.360 --> 00:08:54.360
 Brilliant move.

00:08:54.360 --> 00:08:55.360
 That's great.

00:08:55.360 --> 00:08:59.920
 I read a bizarre thing that this is just things that were banned in the UK on Sundays. It was

00:08:59.920 --> 00:09:06.680
 in, for about 28 years, roughly, in the 16th century, it was made illegal to not wear a

00:09:06.680 --> 00:09:13.320
 woolen cap on a Sunday. And this was not for all parts of society, but it was predominantly

00:09:13.320 --> 00:09:16.640
 for the people who couldn't afford to pay the fight.

00:09:16.640 --> 00:09:23.400
 So Queen Elizabeth basically put a law in place where she said that maids, ladies, gentlemen,

00:09:23.400 --> 00:09:28.560
 noble personages, and every Lord, Knight, and gentleman of 20 marks land were exempt

00:09:28.560 --> 00:09:33.240
 from having to wear this hat, but everyone else had to wear a woolen hat on a Sunday

00:09:33.240 --> 00:09:38.280
 in the UK. And if you were caught not wearing it, you would be fined so much that you probably

00:09:38.280 --> 00:09:41.760
 couldn't afford it and then would have to do jail time. So there was a huge risk to

00:09:41.760 --> 00:09:42.760
 it.

00:09:42.760 --> 00:09:45.160
 And the reason was to help the woolen industry, right?

00:09:45.160 --> 00:09:46.160
 Yeah, exactly.

00:09:46.160 --> 00:09:47.160
 Yeah.

00:09:47.160 --> 00:09:48.640
 What are you in for?

00:09:48.640 --> 00:09:53.640
 Well, I think you can see.

00:09:53.640 --> 00:09:57.360
 That's very hot in summer.

00:09:57.360 --> 00:09:58.360
 Yeah.

00:09:58.360 --> 00:09:59.360
 Yes.

00:09:59.360 --> 00:10:03.080
 Were there regulations about the size of the woolen cap? Could you basically wear a very

00:10:03.080 --> 00:10:05.240
 small sort of button size woolen cap?

00:10:05.240 --> 00:10:12.240
 I think it was a very specific design. It was a sort of uniform style bubble hat that

00:10:12.240 --> 00:10:13.240
 you would have to wear.

00:10:13.240 --> 00:10:18.680
 Yeah. That's been quite a common way of policing these kind of Sunday laws is to find people

00:10:18.680 --> 00:10:24.240
 for not doing it. In 1581, it was the law that you had to go to church every Sunday.

00:10:24.240 --> 00:10:28.080
 Everyone in the country had to go to church. And if you decided you didn't want to, you

00:10:28.080 --> 00:10:34.720
 had to pay a fine of £20 per month. And that was 20 times the average monthly wage. So

00:10:34.720 --> 00:10:39.920
 it would take you almost two years to earn that fine if you didn't do it.

00:10:39.920 --> 00:10:42.920
 Oh, my God, yeah.

00:10:42.920 --> 00:10:46.880
 Just while you mentioned church ceremonies, I found out about the longest church service

00:10:46.880 --> 00:10:49.160
 because this fact is about church intervals.

00:10:49.160 --> 00:10:50.160
 Okay.

00:10:50.160 --> 00:10:51.960
 Have you heard of the Sigwee?

00:10:51.960 --> 00:10:53.560
 Sigwee, don't think so.

00:10:53.560 --> 00:10:55.000
 Are you trying to do a Segway?

00:10:55.000 --> 00:11:00.720
 No. I am trying to do a Segway into a fact about the Sigwee, but that is just a coincidence.

00:11:00.720 --> 00:11:07.680
 This is a mask festival held by the Dogon people of Mali. And it's the last one lasted

00:11:07.680 --> 00:11:08.680
 for six years.

00:11:08.680 --> 00:11:09.680
 Come on.

00:11:09.680 --> 00:11:12.680
 So it's a long service.

00:11:12.680 --> 00:11:16.280
 I'm not sure you have to spend all your time at it. It's not like a sermon that lasts for

00:11:16.280 --> 00:11:21.800
 six years, but you have to carve a great mask and several meters long these masks sometimes.

00:11:21.800 --> 00:11:26.300
 And then you have to perform what the Guinness Book of Records calls a time-consuming procession

00:11:26.300 --> 00:11:28.160
 of dances from village to village.

00:11:28.160 --> 00:11:29.160
 Wow.

00:11:29.160 --> 00:11:31.320
 And yeah, they're not doing another one until 2037.

00:11:31.320 --> 00:11:35.680
 I was wondering if Southern Rail have been on a church interval for the Dogon people

00:11:35.680 --> 00:11:39.160
 of Mali for the last seven years.

00:11:39.160 --> 00:11:44.560
 Okay, it is time for fact number two, and that is James.

00:11:44.560 --> 00:11:50.000
 Okay, my fact this week is that the first ice cream on a stick was called the Good Humour

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:51.000
 Bar.

00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:56.520
 It's a modified version of a lollipop called the Jolly Boy Sucker.

00:11:56.520 --> 00:11:58.400
 You said that like the Jolly Boy Sucker.

00:11:58.400 --> 00:12:01.640
 Well, I would say it was the Jolly Boy Sucker.

00:12:01.640 --> 00:12:03.200
 There's no punctuation.

00:12:03.200 --> 00:12:04.440
 So I don't really know.

00:12:04.440 --> 00:12:07.840
 I don't know how to say it's in the eye of the beholder, isn't it?

00:12:07.840 --> 00:12:14.140
 So this is the weather outside at the moment as we record is absolutely sweltering.

00:12:14.140 --> 00:12:19.500
 So I thought we could do a fact about ice creams and this is about ice creams on a stick.

00:12:19.500 --> 00:12:23.960
 So things like I don't know, magnums or mini milks or whatever you would have.

00:12:23.960 --> 00:12:27.160
 And they were invented in around 1923.

00:12:27.160 --> 00:12:32.000
 So a few years earlier, Harry Burt, who is a guy from Ohio, he'd put a lollipop on a

00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:37.960
 stick which he called the Jolly Boy Sucker and his son suggested adding ice cream on

00:12:37.960 --> 00:12:42.280
 the outside of it and maybe a chocolate covering and it became really popular.

00:12:42.280 --> 00:12:46.880
 And he called it Good Humour because he thought that your mood was related to your sense of

00:12:46.880 --> 00:12:47.880
 taste.

00:12:47.880 --> 00:12:50.580
 If you tasted something really good, you'd always be in a good mood and if you tasted

00:12:50.580 --> 00:12:52.780
 something bad, you would always be in a bad mood.

00:12:52.780 --> 00:12:53.780
 Hang on.

00:12:53.780 --> 00:12:58.040
 Is that like the medieval theory of the four humans where if you're too choleric, you have

00:12:58.040 --> 00:12:59.360
 too much bile?

00:12:59.360 --> 00:13:03.880
 I don't think when he called it Good Humour, he thought it has half a bit of cholera, half

00:13:03.880 --> 00:13:06.180
 a bit of bile, half a bit of blood.

00:13:06.180 --> 00:13:07.700
 I don't think he thought that.

00:13:07.700 --> 00:13:11.580
 But actually Good Humour, I didn't know this because I haven't spent much time in America,

00:13:11.580 --> 00:13:13.140
 but it's quite a big brand in America.

00:13:13.140 --> 00:13:14.660
 It's owned by Unilever, I think.

00:13:14.660 --> 00:13:19.760
 Yeah, I don't know it by name, but I recognize the logo as almost a childhood ice cream,

00:13:19.760 --> 00:13:20.760
 bizarrely.

00:13:20.760 --> 00:13:22.440
 So sorry, was there a lolly?

00:13:22.440 --> 00:13:25.840
 Was it like he kept the lolly inside, did you say?

00:13:25.840 --> 00:13:29.400
 So you break the chocolate and then the ice cream and then you chow down on a rock hard

00:13:29.400 --> 00:13:30.400
 piece of candy.

00:13:30.400 --> 00:13:31.400
 Oh, I did.

00:13:31.400 --> 00:13:32.400
 That's amazing.

00:13:32.400 --> 00:13:33.400
 That's good, isn't it?

00:13:33.400 --> 00:13:34.400
 Do you remember those?

00:13:34.400 --> 00:13:35.400
 What were they called?

00:13:35.400 --> 00:13:37.840
 You used to get ice creams where you had some bubble gum at the bottom.

00:13:37.840 --> 00:13:38.840
 It's a bit like that.

00:13:38.840 --> 00:13:39.840
 Oh, cool.

00:13:39.840 --> 00:13:42.280
 You guys are all too young to remember these things, but...

00:13:42.280 --> 00:13:45.580
 Well, Anna's mum will text 118, 118 and find out what it was.

00:13:45.580 --> 00:13:50.020
 This whole class is going to be me reminiscing about the ice creams of my youth and you guys

00:13:50.020 --> 00:13:54.620
 going, "Oh, we only have carnettos."

00:13:54.620 --> 00:13:56.540
 These Good Humour bars, they were kind of...

00:13:56.540 --> 00:14:00.980
 They were seen as very proper and sort of very...

00:14:00.980 --> 00:14:02.380
 The firm was seen as a very moral one.

00:14:02.380 --> 00:14:06.780
 So there was a book about ice cream, which I looked at a bit of, called Sweet Spot.

00:14:06.780 --> 00:14:10.420
 And it has this to say about the Good Humour trucks, because he kind of invented the ice

00:14:10.420 --> 00:14:12.400
 cream truck in a way as well.

00:14:12.400 --> 00:14:16.680
 It said, "The white shirt and the cap the drivers sported help create a mythology around

00:14:16.680 --> 00:14:20.560
 the Good Humour brand of trustworthiness and dependability.

00:14:20.560 --> 00:14:26.520
 That lasted until the mid-1970s when the Brooklyn District Attorney's Office filed a 244 count

00:14:26.520 --> 00:14:31.640
 indictment of Good Humour, charging the company with falsifying records to hide excessive amounts

00:14:31.640 --> 00:14:32.640
 of bacteria."

00:14:32.640 --> 00:14:33.640
 What?

00:14:33.640 --> 00:14:34.640
 Really?

00:14:34.640 --> 00:14:35.640
 Wow.

00:14:35.640 --> 00:14:37.640
 That was a long time ago, though, we should say.

00:14:37.640 --> 00:14:38.640
 Yes.

00:14:38.640 --> 00:14:39.640
 Very long time ago.

00:14:39.640 --> 00:14:44.700
 The origins of, as you say, like the ice cream truck, and they really cared about the presentation

00:14:44.700 --> 00:14:46.700
 of how they were going through the community.

00:14:46.700 --> 00:14:52.660
 So anyone who became a Good Humour man, which became quite a culturally significant role,

00:14:52.660 --> 00:14:57.220
 there was movies made using that title, The Good Humour Man, later on, they all had to

00:14:57.220 --> 00:15:01.460
 go and do courses to learn how to be the best version of that role.

00:15:01.460 --> 00:15:05.100
 So there was a two to three day course that you would go on.

00:15:05.100 --> 00:15:09.180
 They were taught to always tip their hat towards a lady if they came towards them.

00:15:09.180 --> 00:15:11.080
 And if they didn't do that, they would be fired.

00:15:11.080 --> 00:15:13.760
 And they had to say, "Ice cream, Good Humour."

00:15:13.760 --> 00:15:16.800
 If they said, "Good Humour, Ice Cream," that was the improper way of saying it.

00:15:16.800 --> 00:15:18.680
 And that could lead to them being fired as well.

00:15:18.680 --> 00:15:19.680
 That was quite good.

00:15:19.680 --> 00:15:20.680
 Yeah.

00:15:20.680 --> 00:15:23.000
 There was a handbook called Making Good at Good Humour that they all had to study in

00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:27.400
 order to become this representative of the company.

00:15:27.400 --> 00:15:31.440
 Don't forget, Dan, they also had to falsify records to hide excessive amounts of bacteria

00:15:31.440 --> 00:15:32.440
 in the product.

00:15:32.440 --> 00:15:34.920
 Do you know what people's favourite ice lolly is today?

00:15:34.920 --> 00:15:36.720
 I was quite surprised by this.

00:15:36.720 --> 00:15:38.280
 Also lolly or ice cream?

00:15:38.280 --> 00:15:39.500
 Ice cream or lolly on a stick?

00:15:39.500 --> 00:15:41.540
 Anything cold on a stick?

00:15:41.540 --> 00:15:42.540
 Cold on a stick.

00:15:42.540 --> 00:15:43.540
 Magnum.

00:15:43.540 --> 00:15:44.540
 Yeah, I understand.

00:15:44.540 --> 00:15:45.540
 Oh, you straight away went for Magnum.

00:15:45.540 --> 00:15:46.540
 Okay.

00:15:46.540 --> 00:15:47.540
 It's Magnum.

00:15:47.540 --> 00:15:48.540
 It's bang on Magnum.

00:15:48.540 --> 00:15:49.540
 What is that rabbit?

00:15:49.540 --> 00:15:53.500
 28% of the country think they're the best, and the runner-up is on like 8%.

00:15:53.500 --> 00:15:56.820
 I think it's because it's not very easy to remember any others.

00:15:56.820 --> 00:15:57.820
 Yeah.

00:15:57.820 --> 00:15:58.820
 Do you think?

00:15:58.820 --> 00:15:59.820
 You're right.

00:15:59.820 --> 00:16:00.820
 Yeah.

00:16:00.820 --> 00:16:01.820
 I would go feast.

00:16:01.820 --> 00:16:02.820
 Absolutely, yeah.

00:16:02.820 --> 00:16:03.820
 Feast any day of the week.

00:16:03.820 --> 00:16:04.820
 Yeah, feast is great.

00:16:04.820 --> 00:16:05.820
 But Magnum in...

00:16:05.820 --> 00:16:06.820
 But it's not a market leader in the way that Magnum is.

00:16:06.820 --> 00:16:09.700
 I think saying, "What's your favourite flavour of cola?"

00:16:09.700 --> 00:16:13.060
 You're only going to get people to say Pepsi or Coca-Cola at you.

00:16:13.060 --> 00:16:14.560
 That's true.

00:16:14.560 --> 00:16:20.820
 Well, anyway, it might be so popular because they invented a new kind of chocolate for

00:16:20.820 --> 00:16:21.820
 the Magnum.

00:16:21.820 --> 00:16:22.820
 Oh, really?

00:16:22.820 --> 00:16:24.220
 Which is a really exciting move.

00:16:24.220 --> 00:16:29.320
 They've only been around since the very late '80s, I think, and basically the problem

00:16:29.320 --> 00:16:34.220
 was that chocolate cracks at a certain low temperature, so it was actually very hard

00:16:34.220 --> 00:16:36.740
 to get good quality chocolate around ice cream.

00:16:36.740 --> 00:16:41.100
 And they created this new kind of chocolate that didn't break at minus 40 degrees.

00:16:41.100 --> 00:16:46.980
 And I read this weird blog by a business analyst, which was saying that Magnum is the epitome

00:16:46.980 --> 00:16:49.460
 of good business because of its simplicity.

00:16:49.460 --> 00:16:54.980
 And then when they brought along the new flavours like cherry, gavara, John Lemon, woodchock

00:16:54.980 --> 00:17:00.500
 and jammy Hendrix, none of which I knew existed, they described them as the four horsemen

00:17:00.500 --> 00:17:01.500
 of the apocalypse.

00:17:01.500 --> 00:17:02.500
 Wow.

00:17:02.500 --> 00:17:03.500
 Wow.

00:17:03.500 --> 00:17:04.740
 I don't think we've ever mentioned this before.

00:17:04.740 --> 00:17:10.340
 There is quite a widely known claim that Roger Moore, James Bond, invented the Magnum.

00:17:10.340 --> 00:17:11.340
 Yes.

00:17:11.340 --> 00:17:12.340
 Okay.

00:17:12.340 --> 00:17:16.220
 And it's because he was being interviewed in the 1960s and he was asked, if you could

00:17:16.220 --> 00:17:18.580
 ask one person any question, what would it be?

00:17:18.580 --> 00:17:21.700
 And he said, "I would like to meet Mr. Walls of Walls Ice Cream and say, why don't you

00:17:21.700 --> 00:17:23.940
 do a chalk ice with vanilla on a stick?"

00:17:23.940 --> 00:17:24.940
 Ah.

00:17:24.940 --> 00:17:28.220
 And he also said, "I didn't realise that other people at the time said they wanted to meet

00:17:28.220 --> 00:17:29.220
 Gandhi or Jesus."

00:17:29.220 --> 00:17:31.460
 That was his answer.

00:17:31.460 --> 00:17:37.400
 Anyway, Walls sent him a cake which had plain chocolate on the outside and vanilla ice cream

00:17:37.400 --> 00:17:38.540
 on the inside.

00:17:38.540 --> 00:17:42.420
 And this later got parlayed into he invented the concept of the Magnum.

00:17:42.420 --> 00:17:46.900
 Anyway, the Magnum was eventually made 23 years later, give or take.

00:17:46.900 --> 00:17:47.900
 Okay.

00:17:47.900 --> 00:17:48.900
 Well, he was ahead of his time.

00:17:48.900 --> 00:17:49.900
 Yeah.

00:17:49.900 --> 00:17:55.540
 A spokeswoman for Unilever told the son who asked them about it, "Sadly, we've never heard

00:17:55.540 --> 00:17:58.860
 this brilliant story, but we are thrilled to hear the late great Sir Roger Moore was

00:17:58.860 --> 00:18:00.040
 a fan of Magnum."

00:18:00.040 --> 00:18:03.540
 Very carefully saying, "There's no truth in this measure at all."

00:18:03.540 --> 00:18:08.580
 I believe it, because it often takes a long time between the prototype, like Alexander

00:18:08.580 --> 00:18:09.940
 Fleming discovered penicillin.

00:18:09.940 --> 00:18:14.740
 It was a long time before he was able to market it, so probably in the same way, that first

00:18:14.740 --> 00:18:19.060
 Magnum cake, you know, there was, of course, there was a gap before they could make it

00:18:19.060 --> 00:18:20.060
 possible.

00:18:20.060 --> 00:18:21.060
 Well, didn't...

00:18:21.060 --> 00:18:22.060
 A Magnum cake sounds great.

00:18:22.060 --> 00:18:26.660
 Didn't Harry Burt spend three years trying to get his good humour bar patented as well?

00:18:26.660 --> 00:18:27.660
 Yeah.

00:18:27.660 --> 00:18:31.020
 One was granting the patent, and I think he eventually went down to the patent office

00:18:31.020 --> 00:18:36.140
 with the ice cream and gave out samples, and then according to the story of Good Humour's

00:18:36.140 --> 00:18:39.340
 official website, that's when they were granted the patent.

00:18:39.340 --> 00:18:40.340
 Yeah.

00:18:40.340 --> 00:18:44.660
 He apparently had a five-gallon bucket of these ice creams and just handed them out to absolutely

00:18:44.660 --> 00:18:47.820
 everyone who could make a decision.

00:18:47.820 --> 00:18:51.740
 We were just talking about walls, which is kind of the UK version of Good Humour, because

00:18:51.740 --> 00:18:54.100
 they're both owned by Unilever.

00:18:54.100 --> 00:18:57.580
 They started around the start of the 19th century.

00:18:57.580 --> 00:19:03.660
 In 1812, George the Prince of Wales granted Richard Wall a royal warrant as the purveyor

00:19:03.660 --> 00:19:07.060
 of pork to the king, and that's where they started.

00:19:07.060 --> 00:19:13.300
 He was the official royal purveyor of pork, and it was because he had a shop on German

00:19:13.300 --> 00:19:18.940
 Street in London where he could make sausages, and no one really else could make as good

00:19:18.940 --> 00:19:23.460
 sausages as him, because he had this machine, and it was a donkey that would walk around

00:19:23.460 --> 00:19:29.540
 the machine, and it would create a cutting motion that would turn the meat into mincemeat,

00:19:29.540 --> 00:19:35.180
 which he could then turn into sausages, which he could then purve pork-like to the king.

00:19:35.180 --> 00:19:39.300
 That's amazing, because these days, a technical edge is having a better factory that makes

00:19:39.300 --> 00:19:44.180
 microprocessors more effectively, and in those days, the commercial edge was just your donkey

00:19:44.180 --> 00:19:46.740
 on a street.

00:19:46.740 --> 00:19:52.660
 Then in 1913, they came up the idea, because what would happen is, in the summer, no one

00:19:52.660 --> 00:19:57.020
 wanted pork anymore, because it was too hot for pork, and they were like, have to lay

00:19:57.020 --> 00:20:02.180
 people off, and so they came up with the idea of making ice creams, because they had refrigeration,

00:20:02.180 --> 00:20:06.180
 so they came up with the idea of making ice creams to avoid layoffs, and that's when they

00:20:06.180 --> 00:20:09.940
 became this big, probably the biggest ice cream company in the UK.

00:20:09.940 --> 00:20:15.060
 I thought you were going to say that they sold frozen pork for people to sell, and that was

00:20:15.060 --> 00:20:17.140
 how they part-laid it in.

00:20:17.140 --> 00:20:24.620
 The Magnum used to be a flat sausage on a stick, and the thing was, he also sent people

00:20:24.620 --> 00:20:28.780
 around in an early ice cream van way.

00:20:28.780 --> 00:20:33.700
 They had tricycles with the ice creams in, and they had the slogan, "Stop me and buy

00:20:33.700 --> 00:20:38.660
 one," which still exists today, but he would let them go on a Sunday when most people wouldn't

00:20:38.660 --> 00:20:40.180
 let people work on a Sunday.

00:20:40.180 --> 00:20:44.100
 He would let his ice cream sellers go on a Sunday, but he said that they would only let

00:20:44.100 --> 00:20:49.220
 them do it if they went to church in the morning, and it was under his supervision, so they

00:20:49.220 --> 00:20:52.620
 had to go to church with him in the morning, and if they did, then they could sell the

00:20:52.620 --> 00:20:56.140
 ice creams in the afternoon.

00:20:56.140 --> 00:21:00.460
 Just a little ice cream news story I found in the process of this.

00:21:00.460 --> 00:21:04.900
 In 2018, a man called Mr. Tickle was arrested for threatening an ice cream van owner with

00:21:04.900 --> 00:21:09.140
 a samurai sword while high on cocaine.

00:21:09.140 --> 00:21:13.740
 That started off so risible with Mr. Tickle, and then it went dark really quickly.

00:21:13.740 --> 00:21:15.380
 It's actually an awful story.

00:21:15.380 --> 00:21:16.380
 There were children present.

00:21:16.380 --> 00:21:17.940
 It was incredibly upsetting for them.

00:21:17.940 --> 00:21:20.180
 He later went unhid by some bins before being arrested.

00:21:20.180 --> 00:21:25.780
 Unfortunately, they saw his really long arms poking out from the bins, didn't they?

00:21:25.780 --> 00:21:31.460
 He put up his hands to the cups, knocked down some aeroplanes.

00:21:31.460 --> 00:21:35.540
 Anyway, it's probably too inappropriate, because, yeah, he did threaten the van owner

00:21:35.540 --> 00:21:36.540
 with it.

00:21:36.540 --> 00:21:37.540
 He was called Jamie Tickle.

00:21:37.540 --> 00:21:38.540
 Okay.

00:21:38.540 --> 00:21:39.540
 That's all right?

00:21:39.540 --> 00:21:40.540
 Okay.

00:21:40.540 --> 00:21:41.540
 No one died?

00:21:41.540 --> 00:21:45.580
 No, I just don't want him to come and find me.

00:21:45.580 --> 00:21:46.580
 It's all right.

00:21:46.580 --> 00:21:50.780
 He'll get stopped by the long arm of the last.

00:21:50.780 --> 00:21:54.700
 I've got a 2008 press release that I can tell you about.

00:21:54.700 --> 00:21:59.860
 You guys are too young to remember this, but until 1988, all lollipop sticks had jokes

00:21:59.860 --> 00:22:00.860
 on them.

00:22:00.860 --> 00:22:01.860
 Oh, yeah.

00:22:01.860 --> 00:22:04.820
 So whenever you wet your magnum, when you got to the end of it, you could read the little

00:22:04.820 --> 00:22:06.220
 joke on the sticks.

00:22:06.220 --> 00:22:10.700
 They were phased out in 1988 because they thought that people who were eating ice cream

00:22:10.700 --> 00:22:12.420
 were becoming a bit more sophisticated.

00:22:12.420 --> 00:22:15.980
 They didn't think that the jokes were appropriate anymore.

00:22:15.980 --> 00:22:17.300
 Wait, this is so weird, James.

00:22:17.300 --> 00:22:20.900
 I thought I remembered that, but I was not in a position to read lollipop stick jokes

00:22:20.900 --> 00:22:21.900
 in 1988.

00:22:21.900 --> 00:22:26.500
 It's possible your parents had a lot of out-of-date ice creams that they were giving you.

00:22:26.500 --> 00:22:28.300
 I think that must be it.

00:22:28.300 --> 00:22:29.580
 No more parents, that is likely.

00:22:29.580 --> 00:22:33.300
 They phased them out in 1988, so I suppose there might have been a few stragglers a bit

00:22:33.300 --> 00:22:37.460
 later, but maybe the kids ones, like Minnie Milks, might have kept them on.

00:22:37.460 --> 00:22:43.940
 So in 2008, Walls approached James Corden to start a new career, writing jokes for

00:22:43.940 --> 00:22:47.620
 ice cream sticks because they wanted to bring them back.

00:22:47.620 --> 00:22:51.980
 They said that he would be ideal because James is an up-and-coming comedian who is

00:22:51.980 --> 00:22:52.980
 cutting edge.

00:22:52.980 --> 00:22:53.980
 Yeah.

00:22:53.980 --> 00:22:55.980
 Surely that's a miscareer opportunity for James.

00:22:55.980 --> 00:22:56.980
 I know.

00:22:56.980 --> 00:22:57.980
 We don't know if he said no yet, Hannah.

00:22:57.980 --> 00:22:58.980
 We don't know if he said no.

00:22:58.980 --> 00:22:59.980
 You're right.

00:22:59.980 --> 00:23:02.380
 Well, I think he did say no.

00:23:02.380 --> 00:23:03.780
 But where is he now?

00:23:03.780 --> 00:23:04.780
 Where is he now?

00:23:04.780 --> 00:23:05.780
 Where is he now?

00:23:05.780 --> 00:23:06.780
 Yeah.

00:23:06.780 --> 00:23:11.700
 So what they phased out in the '80s, which only James will remember, is the double popsicle.

00:23:11.700 --> 00:23:15.220
 Actually, I think this was in America, but I didn't know these were such things.

00:23:15.220 --> 00:23:16.220
 I remember those.

00:23:16.220 --> 00:23:18.860
 Like, is it an ice lolly with two sticks?

00:23:18.860 --> 00:23:20.180
 It's a lollipop with two sticks.

00:23:20.180 --> 00:23:21.180
 Oh, right.

00:23:21.180 --> 00:23:22.180
 No, I don't remember that.

00:23:22.180 --> 00:23:27.100
 These were actually a ploy in the Great Depression to sell more people lollipops.

00:23:27.100 --> 00:23:29.660
 So it was invented so that they could sell two for the price of one.

00:23:29.660 --> 00:23:33.660
 So the idea, a public health nightmare, you'll agree, is that you would share a lollipop,

00:23:33.660 --> 00:23:38.980
 so you'd buy one lolly, but you have two sticks, so two people can share it and they hold it.

00:23:38.980 --> 00:23:41.900
 You're each holding a stick and eating it.

00:23:41.900 --> 00:23:42.900
 Your mouths are right next to each other.

00:23:42.900 --> 00:23:45.500
 Well, he's like a lady in the tram moment, just a lot longer.

00:23:45.500 --> 00:23:46.500
 That's a much longer scene.

00:23:46.500 --> 00:23:47.500
 Yeah.

00:23:47.500 --> 00:23:48.500
 That was it.

00:23:48.500 --> 00:23:53.820
 They both lick either side of this lollipop until eventually they both get to this final

00:23:53.820 --> 00:23:58.820
 sliver of lolly where they lick the final bit and then eventually, romantically, they're

00:23:58.820 --> 00:24:02.660
 licking each other's tongues.

00:24:02.660 --> 00:24:08.660
 This is how romance happens in the '20s, I'm telling you, but over the years, I think

00:24:08.660 --> 00:24:13.660
 people forgot that it was meant for two people and so it just became a lolly with two sticks

00:24:13.660 --> 00:24:14.660
 on it.

00:24:14.660 --> 00:24:15.660
 Sorry.

00:24:15.660 --> 00:24:19.320
 You know, in Lady and the Tramp, he basically pretends that he doesn't know what's happening,

00:24:19.320 --> 00:24:20.320
 right?

00:24:20.320 --> 00:24:23.340
 He's just eating this spaghetti and he pretends he doesn't know what's happening and he turns

00:24:23.340 --> 00:24:26.460
 around and he's like, "Oh, now I've got to kiss the other dog.

00:24:26.460 --> 00:24:29.300
 I don't think you could pull that off if you're licking a lollipop."

00:24:29.300 --> 00:24:32.540
 No, because you'd see that there's no flex and give.

00:24:32.540 --> 00:24:33.540
 Like there is in the spaghetti.

00:24:33.540 --> 00:24:34.540
 Yeah.

00:24:34.540 --> 00:24:36.740
 You're looking dead into the other person's eyes for several minutes while you lick his

00:24:36.740 --> 00:24:37.740
 eyes.

00:24:37.740 --> 00:24:38.740
 Literally.

00:24:38.740 --> 00:24:42.780
 At the very start, everyone knows what they're getting themselves into.

00:24:42.780 --> 00:24:46.940
 Well, actually, scientists worked out precisely how many licks it takes to lick a lollipop

00:24:46.940 --> 00:24:47.940
 to the end.

00:24:47.940 --> 00:24:48.940
 To the tongue touching face.

00:24:48.940 --> 00:24:49.940
 They're really scientists.

00:24:49.940 --> 00:24:50.940
 Which scientists are these, Anna?

00:24:50.940 --> 00:24:52.780
 I just want to defend the scientists.

00:24:52.780 --> 00:24:55.660
 They did a very important experiment and then they thought, "How are we going to get the

00:24:55.660 --> 00:24:56.940
 press to pick up on this?"

00:24:56.940 --> 00:25:02.060
 Well, we can use this experiment to also work out how many licks to lick a lolly.

00:25:02.060 --> 00:25:06.540
 So they cooked up this hard candy and they had water currents flow over it.

00:25:06.540 --> 00:25:10.780
 And then they calculated that it would take 2,500 licks to lick a lolly.

00:25:10.780 --> 00:25:16.660
 It's 1,000 licks per centimetre, which I think is extraordinary and flawed because we have

00:25:16.660 --> 00:25:17.660
 saliva, right?

00:25:17.660 --> 00:25:19.700
 Whereas they were using water currents.

00:25:19.700 --> 00:25:22.380
 So our saliva is much more abrasive.

00:25:22.380 --> 00:25:23.380
 Yeah.

00:25:23.380 --> 00:25:24.380
 Okay.

00:25:24.380 --> 00:25:25.380
 You'd think so.

00:25:25.380 --> 00:25:26.380
 Lot of licks though, is what we're saying.

00:25:26.380 --> 00:25:29.500
 Just to take us back to the lady of the trap, I think that means that you're licking for

00:25:29.500 --> 00:25:33.020
 40 minutes before you eventually lick each other's tongues.

00:25:33.020 --> 00:25:34.020
 It's a long scene.

00:25:34.020 --> 00:25:40.420
 Yeah, there's a director's cut available where you can actually see that original scene.

00:25:40.420 --> 00:25:46.900
 Okay, it is time for fact number three and that is Anna.

00:25:46.900 --> 00:25:52.100
 My fact this week is that Kublai Khan's summer palace could be dismantled and folded away

00:25:52.100 --> 00:25:54.100
 at the end of every summer.

00:25:54.100 --> 00:25:55.100
 Aw.

00:25:55.100 --> 00:25:56.220
 It was clever.

00:25:56.220 --> 00:25:57.220
 Like a camping trip.

00:25:57.220 --> 00:25:58.220
 Exactly.

00:25:58.220 --> 00:25:59.220
 Yeah.

00:25:59.220 --> 00:26:00.580
 It went on a big long camping trip.

00:26:00.580 --> 00:26:02.700
 It's sort of everyone's nightmare, except Kublai Khan.

00:26:02.700 --> 00:26:03.700
 He likes it.

00:26:03.700 --> 00:26:07.420
 Did they have that same problem of once they dismantled it, fitting it into the bag that

00:26:07.420 --> 00:26:10.020
 it just only seemed too big to get into?

00:26:10.020 --> 00:26:11.020
 He could never do it.

00:26:11.020 --> 00:26:15.260
 He was always to be heard, "Roll it, don't scrunch it."

00:26:15.260 --> 00:26:16.260
 It was a nightmare.

00:26:16.260 --> 00:26:21.460
 So this was in, it was Kublai Khan, who was the grandson of Genghis and extended his

00:26:21.460 --> 00:26:22.460
 empire.

00:26:22.460 --> 00:26:25.700
 So we're talking the second half of the 13th century.

00:26:25.700 --> 00:26:32.020
 And he had a summer capital in Shandu, or made famous as Zanadu, of course by Coleridge

00:26:32.020 --> 00:26:35.420
 in his poem, but it was called Shandu.

00:26:35.420 --> 00:26:39.500
 And in his summer capital, he had this big palace and it was apparently, you know, really

00:26:39.500 --> 00:26:42.020
 ornate, amazing palace, huge.

00:26:42.020 --> 00:26:46.860
 And it was based on the Mongolian kind of yurt or guh design.

00:26:46.860 --> 00:26:47.860
 So they all had guhs.

00:26:47.860 --> 00:26:49.780
 They were very nomadic people.

00:26:49.780 --> 00:26:53.820
 And so it was held up by 200 silk cords and at the end of the season, you release the

00:26:53.820 --> 00:26:56.020
 cords and the whole thing folds up.

00:26:56.020 --> 00:26:59.260
 Although I don't know how, because it was made of proper materials, it was made of

00:26:59.260 --> 00:27:00.260
 canvas.

00:27:00.260 --> 00:27:04.820
 It was made of like cane and it had these huge pillars and stone dragons on top of it.

00:27:04.820 --> 00:27:05.820
 And domes.

00:27:05.820 --> 00:27:06.820
 Yeah.

00:27:06.820 --> 00:27:09.060
 There's a lot of solid stuff to go in that bag.

00:27:09.060 --> 00:27:10.060
 Yeah.

00:27:10.060 --> 00:27:17.300
 So Kublai Khan, we should say that we largely know this from Marco Polo's account and then

00:27:17.300 --> 00:27:22.420
 supported by Chinese historians who, for instance, list there were five great halls, which might

00:27:22.420 --> 00:27:25.180
 have all been removable, because essentially the Mongols were nomadic.

00:27:25.180 --> 00:27:27.940
 This was the fundamental thing about them.

00:27:27.940 --> 00:27:31.100
 And so they just wanted new land to graze.

00:27:31.100 --> 00:27:34.620
 All their conquering was just about having new grazing land.

00:27:34.620 --> 00:27:38.620
 And so, yeah, it took all their buildings down and buggered off the end of every season.

00:27:38.620 --> 00:27:41.260
 And they went somewhere where they could graze more easily.

00:27:41.260 --> 00:27:42.260
 Is that right?

00:27:42.260 --> 00:27:43.260
 Is that what you're saying?

00:27:43.260 --> 00:27:44.260
 No.

00:27:44.260 --> 00:27:46.500
 This was, this, the buggering off here was just, you know, summer is over, so he went

00:27:46.500 --> 00:27:47.900
 back to the winter capital.

00:27:47.900 --> 00:27:48.900
 Got it.

00:27:48.900 --> 00:27:52.340
 But in all of their conquests and stuff, like one of, so obviously they conquered the biggest

00:27:52.340 --> 00:27:57.860
 contiguous land empire ever known to man, and they didn't care about like settling cities

00:27:57.860 --> 00:27:59.020
 and founding big cities.

00:27:59.020 --> 00:28:02.420
 So they just flattened cities and then would leave them and go home again.

00:28:02.420 --> 00:28:05.900
 And I think people think the reason they didn't take over the whole of Europe is because once

00:28:05.900 --> 00:28:08.980
 they got to Hungary and Poland, it wasn't such good grazing land.

00:28:08.980 --> 00:28:10.260
 So it was kind of pointless.

00:28:10.260 --> 00:28:18.900
 So Kublai Khan was the, was he the first non-Chinese emperor of China, as it were?

00:28:18.900 --> 00:28:19.900
 Yes.

00:28:19.900 --> 00:28:20.900
 Yeah.

00:28:20.900 --> 00:28:21.900
 Is it the Yuan dynasty?

00:28:21.900 --> 00:28:22.900
 Yeah.

00:28:22.900 --> 00:28:23.900
 It's really interesting.

00:28:23.900 --> 00:28:28.020
 One of the things that Marco Polo says about him is the introduction in amongst his group

00:28:28.020 --> 00:28:30.140
 of paper money.

00:28:30.140 --> 00:28:33.260
 So Marco Polo writes about that, brings that back.

00:28:33.260 --> 00:28:38.900
 And just a very tiny thing is the Yuan dynasty or Yuan.

00:28:38.900 --> 00:28:42.820
 In Chinese, another way of you put a different tone on that means money.

00:28:42.820 --> 00:28:48.300
 And I do wonder if there's a connection to those two, because that was such a dominating

00:28:48.300 --> 00:28:50.820
 thing for his court.

00:28:50.820 --> 00:28:51.820
 Yeah.

00:28:51.820 --> 00:28:53.500
 And it was centred, some of it, apparently.

00:28:53.500 --> 00:28:55.460
 Some Chinese paper money was centred.

00:28:55.460 --> 00:28:56.580
 Think around about this time.

00:28:56.580 --> 00:29:00.140
 Well, they were very big on counterfeiting right away, weren't they?

00:29:00.140 --> 00:29:02.540
 They tried to stop every possible...

00:29:02.540 --> 00:29:03.540
 Yeah.

00:29:03.540 --> 00:29:07.860
 But if you went to a bar in Mongolian times, they didn't take a 20-pound note, sniff it,

00:29:07.860 --> 00:29:09.460
 and go, "This isn't real, did they?"

00:29:09.460 --> 00:29:12.740
 I'm not sure that was a counterfeiting thing.

00:29:12.740 --> 00:29:13.740
 Oh, maybe it was.

00:29:13.740 --> 00:29:14.740
 I don't know.

00:29:14.740 --> 00:29:15.740
 Maybe it was.

00:29:15.740 --> 00:29:20.100
 But it was all mulberry bark or it sounds really cool, but actually it was a sheet of

00:29:20.100 --> 00:29:23.540
 paper-like substance derived from the bark of mulberry trees.

00:29:23.540 --> 00:29:28.380
 And it had to be signed by multiple officials and it had pictures of the old money on it

00:29:28.380 --> 00:29:31.900
 as well, which I think might have been a way of explaining what this is to people who weren't

00:29:31.900 --> 00:29:36.820
 accustomed to paper-like money, because the old money was just ropes with coins hanging

00:29:36.820 --> 00:29:37.820
 off them.

00:29:37.820 --> 00:29:41.580
 So it just had a picture of this, "Hey, this is what this was, and now this is what it

00:29:41.580 --> 00:29:42.580
 is."

00:29:42.580 --> 00:29:43.580
 That's so cool.

00:29:43.580 --> 00:29:44.580
 Yeah.

00:29:44.580 --> 00:29:47.780
 That's a bit like when you have, you know, when we all got mobile phones and you'd have

00:29:47.780 --> 00:29:51.860
 a picture of an old-shaped phone on your mobile phone, so you knew that was what you

00:29:51.860 --> 00:29:52.860
 pressed to call someone.

00:29:52.860 --> 00:29:53.860
 It's exactly like that.

00:29:53.860 --> 00:29:54.860
 Yeah.

00:29:54.860 --> 00:29:55.860
 That's so cool.

00:29:55.860 --> 00:29:56.860
 I love schoolomorphism.

00:29:56.860 --> 00:29:57.860
 It's called, isn't it?

00:29:57.860 --> 00:29:58.860
 Yeah.

00:29:58.860 --> 00:30:00.540
 Or a picture of a floppy disk being the sign to save something.

00:30:00.540 --> 00:30:01.540
 Yeah.

00:30:01.540 --> 00:30:03.900
 Or a picture of a carrot to sell dildos.

00:30:03.900 --> 00:30:04.900
 Yeah.

00:30:04.900 --> 00:30:05.900
 Yeah.

00:30:05.900 --> 00:30:06.900
 Sure.

00:30:06.900 --> 00:30:12.140
 Because he had such a big empire, Kublikan, it meant that people could travel from all

00:30:12.140 --> 00:30:15.620
 the way from Europe all the way to the other side of Asia.

00:30:15.620 --> 00:30:19.300
 And that's obviously why Marco Polo managed to get across there, because before that,

00:30:19.300 --> 00:30:23.060
 it was really difficult to traverse those areas.

00:30:23.060 --> 00:30:29.700
 So what's the deal with Marco Polo in that I, the last that I'd read or was told about

00:30:29.700 --> 00:30:33.500
 him is that, you know, he might have been a fraud or that these weren't trustworthy.

00:30:33.500 --> 00:30:40.100
 But all the places that he described, like we know where Xanadu was, we've found the

00:30:40.100 --> 00:30:45.420
 dragon statues, we found he got the perimeter sizes wrong, but they were not too far wrong.

00:30:45.420 --> 00:30:47.700
 Well, he was blindfolded a lot of the time, Marco Polo.

00:30:47.700 --> 00:30:49.260
 So that's why he wasn't able to...

00:30:49.260 --> 00:30:53.660
 There are theories, but they're still pretty unusual that he genuinely didn't get there.

00:30:53.660 --> 00:30:57.700
 I find it totally implausible because he wrote about it in so much detail and it was possible

00:30:57.700 --> 00:30:58.700
 to access.

00:30:58.700 --> 00:31:00.620
 And other people went there as well from the West.

00:31:00.620 --> 00:31:02.860
 William Brubrick was another one.

00:31:02.860 --> 00:31:05.460
 But people used things like he didn't mention the Great Wall of China.

00:31:05.460 --> 00:31:06.460
 Yeah.

00:31:06.460 --> 00:31:08.940
 But actually, the Great Wall of China, it wasn't really that great at that time.

00:31:08.940 --> 00:31:09.940
 So not really worth mentioning.

00:31:09.940 --> 00:31:14.300
 There's people in China who still don't know what the Great Wall of China is, genuinely,

00:31:14.300 --> 00:31:17.240
 because they've not been up in space, have they?

00:31:17.240 --> 00:31:19.580
 So they've not been able to see it.

00:31:19.580 --> 00:31:24.140
 I think the argument is, and I don't subscribe to it either, that he got the stories from

00:31:24.140 --> 00:31:28.300
 other people and he wrote them down rather than him actually going and experiencing it.

00:31:28.300 --> 00:31:31.300
 That's the argument, I think.

00:31:31.300 --> 00:31:35.200
 Another guy who did go and experience the Mongols was this guy called William Brubrick,

00:31:35.200 --> 00:31:36.740
 who was a bit of a Marco Polo.

00:31:36.740 --> 00:31:41.100
 He was a Franciscan, we talked about Franciscans recently, he was a missionary.

00:31:41.100 --> 00:31:45.580
 And he revealed to us a serious problem with the Khan dynasties, with the Mongol dynasties,

00:31:45.580 --> 00:31:47.020
 which was alcoholism.

00:31:47.020 --> 00:31:49.300
 So a lot of them had a real issue with this.

00:31:49.300 --> 00:31:54.540
 He talked about this amazing thing called the silvertree of Karakorum in the Mongol capital.

00:31:54.540 --> 00:31:56.300
 And it sounds extraordinary.

00:31:56.300 --> 00:32:02.260
 So it was a huge tall silvertree in the center, and it had an angel, sort of angel-type fairy

00:32:02.260 --> 00:32:07.140
 figure with a trumpet on top of it, and then it had lions all around it, and the lions

00:32:07.140 --> 00:32:09.260
 would spout a different drink from their mouths.

00:32:09.260 --> 00:32:14.680
 So there were four lions, and the lions produced grape wine, fermented maize milk, rice wine,

00:32:14.680 --> 00:32:18.140
 and honey mead, depending on which you fancy.

00:32:18.140 --> 00:32:22.220
 And the way it worked, well, the way it was supposed to work was that the angel on top

00:32:22.220 --> 00:32:25.340
 of the fountain was an automaton, and he blew some bellows at the bottom.

00:32:25.340 --> 00:32:28.020
 It played a trumpet, servants rushed out and filled it.

00:32:28.020 --> 00:32:32.420
 But the angel automaton never worked, and so what they had to be was a man inside the

00:32:32.420 --> 00:32:37.180
 trunk of the tree at all times with a trumpet, who as soon as the emperor decided he wanted

00:32:37.180 --> 00:32:41.140
 a drink, had to blow the trumpet so it looked like the angel was blowing it, and then everyone

00:32:41.140 --> 00:32:42.640
 flocked in to refill it.

00:32:42.640 --> 00:32:43.640
 But then how amazing is that?

00:32:43.640 --> 00:32:48.180
 He'd have a party, and there'd be lion fountains spouting every drink of his choice.

00:32:48.180 --> 00:32:49.180
 That's so good.

00:32:49.180 --> 00:32:50.180
 Pretty good.

00:32:50.180 --> 00:32:51.180
 That's amazing.

00:32:51.180 --> 00:32:55.180
 I probably would have replaced the maize milk with, like, maybe sangria.

00:32:55.180 --> 00:32:56.260
 But that's just me.

00:32:56.260 --> 00:32:57.260
 That's what I like.

00:32:57.260 --> 00:32:58.260
 Yeah.

00:32:58.260 --> 00:33:00.180
 Maybe the later dynasties went there.

00:33:00.180 --> 00:33:03.780
 It's like those magical machines that you get in Nandos, which have five different kinds

00:33:03.780 --> 00:33:06.380
 of soft drink in them, basically.

00:33:06.380 --> 00:33:08.980
 It's cut based on that.

00:33:08.980 --> 00:33:14.680
 They actually have a very small man inside them, with a pair of bellows.

00:33:14.680 --> 00:33:17.780
 I do actually have another Nandos-related Kublai Khan fact.

00:33:17.780 --> 00:33:18.780
 Do you mean another?

00:33:18.780 --> 00:33:21.180
 That last one wasn't related to Nandos.

00:33:21.180 --> 00:33:24.180
 You just shoe-horned it in.

00:33:24.180 --> 00:33:26.180
 It's so true.

00:33:26.180 --> 00:33:30.140
 Whenever he had his raw horse meat, he used to put a little flag in it, didn't he?

00:33:30.140 --> 00:33:34.580
 He'd say, "How spicy you want to be?"

00:33:34.580 --> 00:33:40.300
 Well, if you thought that lick was tenuous James, you'd wait till you hear this one.

00:33:40.300 --> 00:33:44.820
 One of Andy's famous sugois, or whatever it was you were calling them, sugoi.

00:33:44.820 --> 00:33:50.860
 I think that Kublai Khan basically invented the Nandos black card, which is a card where

00:33:50.860 --> 00:33:53.860
 you get free Nandos forever if you have this, right?

00:33:53.860 --> 00:33:54.860
 Yeah.

00:33:54.860 --> 00:33:55.860
 That's what the Nandos black card is.

00:33:55.860 --> 00:34:00.060
 Kublai Khan had a bit of a correspondence with the then Pope.

00:34:00.060 --> 00:34:05.020
 Obviously, this is incredibly difficult to do because you're thousands of miles away

00:34:05.020 --> 00:34:06.900
 and transporting letters to the nightmare.

00:34:06.900 --> 00:34:13.660
 But he sent Khan, this is, sent an ambassador with a paisa, which is a golden tablet, which

00:34:13.660 --> 00:34:16.860
 is three inches wide and one foot long.

00:34:16.860 --> 00:34:23.020
 What the paisa does is, it authorizes the holder to free food and lodging anywhere throughout

00:34:23.020 --> 00:34:24.260
 Kublai Khan's dominion.

00:34:24.260 --> 00:34:28.460
 So, it's effectively a Nandos black card for a whole country.

00:34:28.460 --> 00:34:29.460
 Yes.

00:34:29.460 --> 00:34:30.900
 No, I'm going to give you that.

00:34:30.900 --> 00:34:31.900
 Andy.

00:34:31.900 --> 00:34:32.900
 Yeah.

00:34:32.900 --> 00:34:34.780
 Marco Polo had one of those as well.

00:34:34.780 --> 00:34:35.780
 Did he?

00:34:35.780 --> 00:34:36.780
 Yeah.

00:34:36.780 --> 00:34:42.100
 Marco Polo, when he left to come back to Italy, he was given one of these golden tablets and

00:34:42.100 --> 00:34:47.380
 it worked brilliantly until he reached the stronghold of his influence and it got weaker

00:34:47.380 --> 00:34:48.380
 and weaker.

00:34:48.380 --> 00:34:52.300
 At that point, the gold tablet meant nothing and they started getting beat up and they started

00:34:52.300 --> 00:34:53.300
 losing the clothes.

00:34:53.300 --> 00:34:58.020
 That's what led to basically him arriving back as a Ruffian, supposedly, and being jailed.

00:34:58.020 --> 00:34:59.020
 Really?

00:34:59.020 --> 00:35:00.020
 Yeah.

00:35:00.020 --> 00:35:03.380
 It's like when he tried to pay with Scottish money for something at the corner.

00:35:03.380 --> 00:35:07.300
 I'm like, no, this is legit, I promise you.

00:35:07.300 --> 00:35:11.460
 So the person who made it for the whole dynasty was Genghis, right?

00:35:11.460 --> 00:35:15.620
 And he started off really poverty-stricken, so he started off being a hunter-gatherer

00:35:15.620 --> 00:35:19.900
 because he was basically exiled, but he was born, this is this weird thing, he was born

00:35:19.900 --> 00:35:25.100
 with a clot of blood in his hand, apparently, which meant that you were going to be a great

00:35:25.100 --> 00:35:26.100
 ruler.

00:35:26.100 --> 00:35:29.940
 I mean, obviously he wasn't, if we don't believe in the mythology of these times, but if you're

00:35:29.940 --> 00:35:34.740
 a Mongol, a clot of blood in his hand and it was a sign that he was going to be ruthless

00:35:34.740 --> 00:35:35.740
 and he was.

00:35:35.740 --> 00:35:40.940
 So once he massacred, as well as massacring an entire city, he massacred all the pets,

00:35:40.940 --> 00:35:44.820
 all the cats and dogs and cows and camels in the city as well.

00:35:44.820 --> 00:35:47.380
 What an awful person.

00:35:47.380 --> 00:35:50.340
 He was a bad guy, but he really liked loyalty.

00:35:50.340 --> 00:35:51.540
 He was a good guy to his mates.

00:35:51.540 --> 00:35:55.900
 He was one of those, if you're friends with him, he's really good to you.

00:35:55.900 --> 00:35:59.780
 He was in one battle and someone almost killed him, shooting his horse out from underneath

00:35:59.780 --> 00:36:00.780
 him.

00:36:00.780 --> 00:36:03.780
 And he sort of stopped the battle, took a bunch of them prisoner and was like, who was

00:36:03.780 --> 00:36:06.300
 it who almost shot that horse out from under me?

00:36:06.300 --> 00:36:09.660
 And the guy put his hand up for some reason and Genghis said, okay, you, that was a great

00:36:09.660 --> 00:36:11.460
 shot, come on my side.

00:36:11.460 --> 00:36:14.940
 And this guy ended up being one of his most important generals, helped him conquer the

00:36:14.940 --> 00:36:15.940
 world.

00:36:15.940 --> 00:36:16.940
 Wow.

00:36:16.940 --> 00:36:17.940
 Genghis, good sign.

00:36:17.940 --> 00:36:22.780
 When he went through the Middle East trying to siege all these cities, the reason that

00:36:22.780 --> 00:36:28.300
 they were so good is they had these massive catapults and their catapults were amazing.

00:36:28.300 --> 00:36:32.180
 And they would fire the stones at the city walls and then eventually they would have

00:36:32.180 --> 00:36:33.700
 to give up.

00:36:33.700 --> 00:36:38.860
 And they were so important that if, you know how they killed all the dogs and cats and stuff

00:36:38.860 --> 00:36:39.860
 like that.

00:36:39.860 --> 00:36:42.700
 Well, they wouldn't kill the engineers of the city.

00:36:42.700 --> 00:36:46.900
 They give them a chance to kind of come over to the Mongol side because they knew how important

00:36:46.900 --> 00:36:48.300
 the engineers were.

00:36:48.300 --> 00:36:52.360
 And if they agreed, then they would come over and they become part of the Mongol army.

00:36:52.360 --> 00:36:57.900
 And there was one city in China somewhere, I can't remember what it's called.

00:36:57.900 --> 00:37:01.220
 And they heard about this, that this was happening and they heard the Mongols were coming and

00:37:01.220 --> 00:37:04.460
 they decided to get rid of all the stones from the area.

00:37:04.460 --> 00:37:09.740
 So for a couple of days, they literally within about a mile circle, they grabbed every single

00:37:09.740 --> 00:37:12.980
 stone they could find and brought it into the city.

00:37:12.980 --> 00:37:16.660
 But then what the Mongols did instead was they got some mulberry trees, chopped them

00:37:16.660 --> 00:37:20.720
 down, put them in water, left them out to dry and they became rock hard and they could

00:37:20.720 --> 00:37:24.620
 use those instead of stones to fire in the city.

00:37:24.620 --> 00:37:29.500
 Now there's some argument that they weren't good enough and in the end they had to bring

00:37:29.500 --> 00:37:33.380
 in some stones from somewhere else because they had like a, like a postal service for

00:37:33.380 --> 00:37:39.260
 stones that they used sometimes where they kept like storage of stones, like an Amazon

00:37:39.260 --> 00:37:43.900
 storage site of parcels, but they would keep stones in all these different places.

00:37:43.900 --> 00:37:44.900
 Really?

00:37:44.900 --> 00:37:48.340
 Yeah, they would be like one day's ride away and they bring the stones to each place.

00:37:48.340 --> 00:37:50.940
 So there's an argument that they might have done that or it might have been these mulberry

00:37:50.940 --> 00:37:51.940
 trees.

00:37:51.940 --> 00:37:52.940
 We don't know.

00:37:52.940 --> 00:37:53.940
 That's so funny.

00:37:53.940 --> 00:37:54.940
 That's so expensive.

00:37:54.940 --> 00:37:57.540
 If you're shipping stones internationally, it's hard enough to ship a hardback book,

00:37:57.540 --> 00:38:00.220
 but imagine like a hundred bricks or something.

00:38:00.220 --> 00:38:04.860
 And you're asking for next day delivery on a lot of these stones.

00:38:04.860 --> 00:38:09.900
 Presumably though, you could catapult it to the area you want to get it.

00:38:09.900 --> 00:38:11.620
 That's such a good idea.

00:38:11.620 --> 00:38:14.020
 Just catapult on to the next catapult.

00:38:14.020 --> 00:38:16.100
 I don't think they even thought of that, Doug.

00:38:16.100 --> 00:38:18.700
 Only even in charge.

00:38:18.700 --> 00:38:23.420
 They used to also tie trees to their horses if they didn't need the trees to be replacement

00:38:23.420 --> 00:38:24.420
 rocks.

00:38:24.420 --> 00:38:28.100
 So they had all these clever tactics for scaring the enemy and one of them was tying trees

00:38:28.100 --> 00:38:29.460
 to the horses that didn't have riders.

00:38:29.460 --> 00:38:31.940
 So it sounded like they had a much bigger army than they did.

00:38:31.940 --> 00:38:32.940
 Sorry.

00:38:32.940 --> 00:38:33.940
 The horses would sound much heavier.

00:38:33.940 --> 00:38:34.940
 They were just hanging along a tree.

00:38:34.940 --> 00:38:35.940
 Okay.

00:38:35.940 --> 00:38:36.940
 Sorry.

00:38:36.940 --> 00:38:41.940
 Tying trees to the horses makes it just sound like you're tying your horse to a tree.

00:38:41.940 --> 00:38:42.940
 Sorry.

00:38:42.940 --> 00:38:43.940
 But you're getting it wrong.

00:38:43.940 --> 00:38:46.360
 There's a very big difference between tying your tree to a horse and trying to get a horse

00:38:46.360 --> 00:38:47.360
 to a tree.

00:38:47.360 --> 00:38:48.860
 It's a completely different thing.

00:38:48.860 --> 00:38:54.860
 Imagine being the one guy who's just standing there going, "I don't understand this tactic.

00:38:54.860 --> 00:38:58.660
 Where's everyone gone?"

00:38:58.660 --> 00:39:00.300
 Oh, no.

00:39:00.300 --> 00:39:01.300
 Oh, embarrassing.

00:39:01.300 --> 00:39:02.300
 Yeah.

00:39:02.300 --> 00:39:03.300
 Sorry.

00:39:03.300 --> 00:39:05.020
 Tying trees and branches.

00:39:05.020 --> 00:39:09.180
 And they did things like they banged metal pots together and they ruffled bells when

00:39:09.180 --> 00:39:14.820
 they galloped into battle so that the opposing army couldn't hear each other shout instructions.

00:39:14.820 --> 00:39:15.820
 They wanted it into battle.

00:39:15.820 --> 00:39:19.380
 When they were going into battle, they would bang metal pots and pans together and they'd

00:39:19.380 --> 00:39:20.940
 rung lots of bells and stuff.

00:39:20.940 --> 00:39:24.700
 And that meant that the opposition couldn't hear each other shout out.

00:39:24.700 --> 00:39:25.900
 That's really interesting.

00:39:25.900 --> 00:39:29.020
 You won't be able to hear yourself think.

00:39:29.020 --> 00:39:32.980
 But that's what happens in American football.

00:39:32.980 --> 00:39:36.460
 When the other team's on offense and they need to make all their signals, you get your

00:39:36.460 --> 00:39:40.340
 fans to make as much noise as possible so that they can't get the signals across.

00:39:40.340 --> 00:39:41.340
 Oh, wow.

00:39:41.340 --> 00:39:42.340
 And it means that they can't do it.

00:39:42.340 --> 00:39:44.180
 So that is a really common thing in American football.

00:39:44.180 --> 00:39:45.180
 Wow.

00:39:45.180 --> 00:39:48.180
 And then you slaughter the entire opponent, didn't you?

00:39:48.180 --> 00:39:49.180
 Yes.

00:39:49.180 --> 00:39:50.180
 Hang on.

00:39:50.180 --> 00:39:54.940
 Just to go back to this tying your tree to a horse thing, doesn't that...

00:39:54.940 --> 00:39:58.940
 And so the idea is the enemy thinks you've got a much bigger army because it sounds bigger.

00:39:58.940 --> 00:40:00.820
 This rumbler's bigger, isn't it?

00:40:00.820 --> 00:40:01.820
 Well, the rumbler's bigger.

00:40:01.820 --> 00:40:07.180
 But this only works in a place where the enemy can hear you but not see you, for one thing.

00:40:07.180 --> 00:40:08.180
 Well, no.

00:40:08.180 --> 00:40:12.100
 If you're running with an army, presumably a lot of this is going to be on dirt, there's

00:40:12.100 --> 00:40:15.540
 going to be a lot of dust raising, you're going to create...

00:40:15.540 --> 00:40:16.860
 It's all theatrics.

00:40:16.860 --> 00:40:18.900
 That's thought it through.

00:40:18.900 --> 00:40:19.900
 You really should have been in charge.

00:40:19.900 --> 00:40:20.900
 You're so right.

00:40:20.900 --> 00:40:23.220
 The Mongolian desert, there's sand everywhere.

00:40:23.220 --> 00:40:24.220
 You can't see a thing.

00:40:24.220 --> 00:40:27.780
 But the reason Dad didn't go there is because of the death worms they have in Mongolia.

00:40:27.780 --> 00:40:32.700
 They're killed by lightning bolts from the Anus.

00:40:32.700 --> 00:40:34.540
 No, thank you.

00:40:34.540 --> 00:40:41.260
 This Kubla Khan, Samuel Taylor Coleridge, sort of immortalized Xanadu in that great poem

00:40:41.260 --> 00:40:42.260
 of his.

00:40:42.260 --> 00:40:45.220
 And this is such a basic thing that I didn't know.

00:40:45.220 --> 00:40:49.340
 So I'm saying it for the other people out there who did not know this, even though 90%

00:40:49.340 --> 00:40:50.700
 of you will.

00:40:50.700 --> 00:40:55.380
 He never finished the poem because someone knocked at his door, a person from Porlock,

00:40:55.380 --> 00:40:58.700
 and he lost his creative thread and didn't know how to finish it.

00:40:58.700 --> 00:41:02.500
 And I didn't realize that that's become a term that you use for when creativity is

00:41:02.500 --> 00:41:07.140
 disrupted, when your inspiration suddenly goes because of some exterior thing.

00:41:07.140 --> 00:41:12.140
 A person from Porlock has come is the term to say, I've lost my thread of creativity.

00:41:12.140 --> 00:41:16.060
 I think it's fair, Dan, that that is not an extremely common phrase that people use

00:41:16.060 --> 00:41:17.060
 all the time.

00:41:17.060 --> 00:41:18.060
 Oh, really?

00:41:18.060 --> 00:41:19.060
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:41:19.060 --> 00:41:21.660
 I wouldn't say 90% of the people listening to this.

00:41:21.660 --> 00:41:25.540
 If you're listening to this, you're not in a 10% of people who didn't know this.

00:41:25.540 --> 00:41:27.780
 Because you just say, it's not that common.

00:41:27.780 --> 00:41:30.860
 Well, it's a way to make all of our listeners feel very stupid.

00:41:30.860 --> 00:41:35.740
 Well, I was in the category, but then that's even more insulting, I guess.

00:41:35.740 --> 00:41:36.740
 Yeah.

00:41:36.740 --> 00:41:39.020
 So, so he wrote it in this opium haze.

00:41:39.020 --> 00:41:45.340
 He was inspired after reading about the description of Xanadu in Marco Polo's accounts.

00:41:45.340 --> 00:41:47.880
 And it never got, now I haven't actually read it myself.

00:41:47.880 --> 00:41:49.620
 So does it just cut off?

00:41:49.620 --> 00:41:50.620
 Or?

00:41:50.620 --> 00:41:51.620
 Yeah.

00:41:51.620 --> 00:41:53.980
 It just writes about a person from Poloq at the end of the door.

00:41:53.980 --> 00:41:54.980
 It doesn't write into the poem.

00:41:54.980 --> 00:41:55.980
 Oh, sorry.

00:41:55.980 --> 00:41:56.980
 Who's that at the door?

00:41:56.980 --> 00:41:57.980
 Hang on.

00:41:57.980 --> 00:41:58.980
 I'll be back in a minute.

00:41:58.980 --> 00:41:59.980
 I've got a great idea for the ending.

00:41:59.980 --> 00:42:02.420
 And then he comes back and he's like, oh, I've got to rhyme something with ending now.

00:42:02.420 --> 00:42:04.420
 What am I going to do?

00:42:04.420 --> 00:42:08.100
 No, it does stop halfway through.

00:42:08.100 --> 00:42:11.980
 And actually a lot of people think that there was no person from Poloq, and it was just

00:42:11.980 --> 00:42:12.980
 an excuse.

00:42:12.980 --> 00:42:16.020
 And a lot of people think that it might be just because he was off his face on opium

00:42:16.020 --> 00:42:17.940
 that he maybe didn't finish it.

00:42:17.940 --> 00:42:25.220
 OK, it is time for our final fact of the show and that is Andy.

00:42:25.220 --> 00:42:30.100
 My fact is that according to the people who have drunk it, billion year old water tastes

00:42:30.100 --> 00:42:31.100
 terrible.

00:42:31.100 --> 00:42:32.100
 I know.

00:42:32.100 --> 00:42:33.100
 Shock.

00:42:33.100 --> 00:42:34.100
 I know.

00:42:34.100 --> 00:42:42.980
 So this doesn't make any sense because I've got some water right here and I've been drinking

00:42:42.980 --> 00:42:43.980
 it.

00:42:43.980 --> 00:42:46.460
 And this water here, I would say, is more than a billion years old.

00:42:46.460 --> 00:42:47.460
 Really?

00:42:47.460 --> 00:42:51.020
 This water is like four billion years old or something, twelve billion years old.

00:42:51.020 --> 00:42:52.660
 And it tastes fine to me.

00:42:52.660 --> 00:42:53.660
 All water, surely.

00:42:53.660 --> 00:42:54.900
 Surely it's been cleaned.

00:42:54.900 --> 00:42:55.900
 It's been...

00:42:55.900 --> 00:42:56.900
 No.

00:42:56.900 --> 00:42:57.900
 So you don't make water, do you?

00:42:57.900 --> 00:42:58.900
 Like, the earth doesn't make water.

00:42:58.900 --> 00:43:02.820
 The water that we have now is the same water as when the dinosaurs were around.

00:43:02.820 --> 00:43:07.940
 So I'm receiving a lot of early challenges on this fact and I'll go into it a bit more.

00:43:07.940 --> 00:43:13.100
 So you're absolutely right that pretty much all the water on the planet is unbelievably

00:43:13.100 --> 00:43:17.420
 old and may well be much older than a billion years.

00:43:17.420 --> 00:43:23.900
 This is a body or a pocket of water which was found by a team of Canadian scientists

00:43:23.900 --> 00:43:28.180
 led by Barbara Sherwood Lola, who is an earth sciences professor.

00:43:28.180 --> 00:43:34.700
 And she and her team found a bit of water about a mile down in Canada, beneath a mine.

00:43:34.700 --> 00:43:39.460
 And this pocket has been isolated from the rest of the world for over a billion years.

00:43:39.460 --> 00:43:44.260
 So pretty much all of the water on the planet is part of the water cycle where it will cycle

00:43:44.260 --> 00:43:45.260
 into the oceans.

00:43:45.260 --> 00:43:46.260
 It'll cycle into clouds.

00:43:46.260 --> 00:43:48.580
 It'll maybe go into underground aquifers.

00:43:48.580 --> 00:43:53.180
 But this stuff that she found and her team has been isolated for up to two and a half

00:43:53.180 --> 00:43:54.180
 billion years.

00:43:54.180 --> 00:43:57.340
 It's really, really, really, you know, it's been kept separate.

00:43:57.340 --> 00:43:59.540
 It's not been in circulation.

00:43:59.540 --> 00:44:03.820
 And she was interviewed about it a few years ago and she says she tastes it from time to

00:44:03.820 --> 00:44:07.140
 time and it always tastes terrible.

00:44:07.140 --> 00:44:10.500
 And she doesn't let her students do it because obviously there isn't a huge amount of this

00:44:10.500 --> 00:44:11.500
 stuff to go around.

00:44:11.500 --> 00:44:12.500
 And so.

00:44:12.500 --> 00:44:14.940
 So this is a common thing, apparently, right?

00:44:14.940 --> 00:44:18.100
 Geologists just go around licking and tasting the stuff that they're investigating.

00:44:18.100 --> 00:44:22.500
 She was saying to find because apparently you can get an immediate read if you get at that

00:44:22.500 --> 00:44:26.140
 kind of thing of the kinds of minerals and stuff or the extent of the minerals.

00:44:26.140 --> 00:44:30.140
 And she did say that if you're a geologist who works with rocks, you've licked a lot of

00:44:30.140 --> 00:44:31.140
 rocks.

00:44:31.140 --> 00:44:32.140
 Yeah.

00:44:32.140 --> 00:44:33.140
 Which is quite weird.

00:44:33.140 --> 00:44:35.580
 The point is that she's looking for the oldest water in the world.

00:44:35.580 --> 00:44:36.980
 That's like what their job is.

00:44:36.980 --> 00:44:38.380
 That's what they're looking for.

00:44:38.380 --> 00:44:43.300
 And the older it is, the saltier it gets because it means all the bits from the rocks are leached

00:44:43.300 --> 00:44:44.300
 into it.

00:44:44.300 --> 00:44:47.980
 So as you're going, you're kind of licking little bits of water to get saltier and saltier

00:44:47.980 --> 00:44:48.980
 and saltier.

00:44:48.980 --> 00:44:51.540
 And the most salty one you get is probably the oldest.

00:44:51.540 --> 00:44:52.540
 Right.

00:44:52.540 --> 00:44:53.540
 Yeah.

00:44:53.540 --> 00:44:54.540
 So that's why she does that.

00:44:54.540 --> 00:44:58.220
 If that was her job, she did a bloody good job of it because the previous record holder

00:44:58.220 --> 00:45:00.540
 was only tens of millions of years old.

00:45:00.540 --> 00:45:05.020
 So she's not only found one that's older, but by almost two and a half billion years.

00:45:05.020 --> 00:45:06.740
 It's pretty good going.

00:45:06.740 --> 00:45:10.180
 The reason that they realized that this one is so much older than any they found before

00:45:10.180 --> 00:45:13.940
 is they've got a new technique of checking how old things are.

00:45:13.940 --> 00:45:18.700
 And by using this new technique, which was, I think, discovered by the University of Manchester

00:45:18.700 --> 00:45:24.780
 in England, they kind of looked at the isotopes of various gases which are found in this water.

00:45:24.780 --> 00:45:29.160
 And by doing that, I won't explain exactly how you do that because it's pretty obvious

00:45:29.160 --> 00:45:30.160
 for everyone.

00:45:30.160 --> 00:45:34.420
 But basically, you work out how many of certain isotopes of these noble gases are in your

00:45:34.420 --> 00:45:39.420
 water, and that will tell you when it kind of landed there in your aquifer.

00:45:39.420 --> 00:45:40.420
 Yeah.

00:45:40.420 --> 00:45:47.220
 But to go back to Anna's original complaint about this fact, it is bizarre that water is

00:45:47.220 --> 00:45:51.420
 - there's a lot of water which is older than the sun.

00:45:51.420 --> 00:45:52.420
 Most water is older than the sun.

00:45:52.420 --> 00:45:53.420
 Yeah.

00:45:53.420 --> 00:45:54.420
 Four billion years old.

00:45:54.420 --> 00:45:55.420
 Four and a half billion years old.

00:45:55.420 --> 00:45:56.420
 Is that bizarre?

00:45:56.420 --> 00:46:00.100
 You don't find it bizarre that the water on the planet is older than the rock?

00:46:00.100 --> 00:46:01.100
 Well, I know.

00:46:01.100 --> 00:46:02.100
 I find it bizarre.

00:46:02.100 --> 00:46:03.620
 But I know that we have a lot of alien water.

00:46:03.620 --> 00:46:04.620
 So it's...

00:46:04.620 --> 00:46:05.620
 Yeah.

00:46:05.620 --> 00:46:08.660
 That's the thing I'm saying is bizarre that there's a lot of alien water which predates

00:46:08.660 --> 00:46:09.660
 the planet forming.

00:46:09.660 --> 00:46:10.660
 Yeah.

00:46:10.660 --> 00:46:11.660
 I think that's mad.

00:46:11.660 --> 00:46:12.660
 It is mad.

00:46:12.660 --> 00:46:13.660
 He's right.

00:46:13.660 --> 00:46:18.540
 So most of the water that we have on earth, we think, actually it's interesting because

00:46:18.540 --> 00:46:23.860
 no one really knows where all the water comes from, but we think most of it comes from asteroids

00:46:23.860 --> 00:46:27.900
 because you can look at the chemical compositions of your water and notice that it's quite similar

00:46:27.900 --> 00:46:29.740
 to what you find in asteroids.

00:46:29.740 --> 00:46:34.420
 But some of it has come from the actual formation of the sun itself.

00:46:34.420 --> 00:46:39.540
 So when the sun forms, all these bits come together to make this massive body in space,

00:46:39.540 --> 00:46:43.940
 but some of it becomes what's called the solar nebula, which is like a gaseous part of the

00:46:43.940 --> 00:46:46.060
 sun which doesn't become the sun itself.

00:46:46.060 --> 00:46:50.860
 And apparently a lot of that stuff has come down to earth and become some of the water.

00:46:50.860 --> 00:46:52.260
 So it didn't all come from asteroids.

00:46:52.260 --> 00:46:54.820
 Some of it came from the formation of the sun.

00:46:54.820 --> 00:47:01.260
 And apparently for every 100 molecules of water, one or two come from the solar nebula.

00:47:01.260 --> 00:47:06.300
 So Anna's big jug of water that she's drinking from at the moment will have millions and

00:47:06.300 --> 00:47:10.300
 millions, well, way more than millions of molecules that came from the formation of

00:47:10.300 --> 00:47:11.300
 the sun.

00:47:11.300 --> 00:47:14.140
 But most of it will have probably come from asteroids.

00:47:14.140 --> 00:47:19.580
 And that could be why water evaporates if you believe in a fringe theory because the

00:47:19.580 --> 00:47:25.900
 sun causes water to evaporate because it wants its water back, so it's trying to suck it

00:47:25.900 --> 00:47:26.900
 back up.

00:47:26.900 --> 00:47:27.900
 I mean, yeah.

00:47:27.900 --> 00:47:29.700
 It's just a new theory.

00:47:29.700 --> 00:47:30.940
 But why it would put itself out?

00:47:30.940 --> 00:47:33.300
 It sounds like a brand new theory, Anna.

00:47:33.300 --> 00:47:37.860
 Oh my God, there is so much going wrong in these last few things that people have said.

00:47:37.860 --> 00:47:39.460
 We should move on.

00:47:39.460 --> 00:47:41.660
 Just leave that as accepted facts.

00:47:41.660 --> 00:47:42.940
 Move on.

00:47:42.940 --> 00:47:48.580
 Just to go into slightly more kind of human timescales of water, do you know why water

00:47:48.580 --> 00:47:51.780
 tastes weird when you've left it overnight?

00:47:51.780 --> 00:47:56.140
 It's gone funky because flies have gone in there and...

00:47:56.140 --> 00:47:57.140
 Yeah.

00:47:57.140 --> 00:48:00.100
 James' glasses of water are always full of flies floating.

00:48:00.100 --> 00:48:01.620
 No, they've flown off again.

00:48:01.620 --> 00:48:05.420
 They kind of go in for a little bath in the evening when I'm not around.

00:48:05.420 --> 00:48:07.740
 James, you have to sort out your fly situation.

00:48:07.740 --> 00:48:09.780
 No, that's not it.

00:48:09.780 --> 00:48:15.380
 It's that carbon dioxide from the air has dissolved in the water and it's formed carbonic

00:48:15.380 --> 00:48:16.380
 acid.

00:48:16.380 --> 00:48:19.900
 So basically, according to one article I read about it, you're basically drinking very,

00:48:19.900 --> 00:48:22.740
 very mild acid rain the next morning.

00:48:22.740 --> 00:48:23.740
 Wow.

00:48:23.740 --> 00:48:24.740
 It was really interesting.

00:48:24.740 --> 00:48:30.500
 This is a bit of a personal story, but I'm in Sussex at the moment and had visitors come

00:48:30.500 --> 00:48:35.260
 recently from Oxfordshire when it was after the time when you were allowed to have visitors.

00:48:35.260 --> 00:48:38.540
 And they came from Oxfordshire and one of them had a bottle of water they brought from Oxford

00:48:38.540 --> 00:48:43.260
 and we tasted it and then they tasted the water here and said, "Oh, Sussex water is so delicious,

00:48:43.260 --> 00:48:44.260
 isn't it?

00:48:44.260 --> 00:48:45.260
 So much nicer."

00:48:45.260 --> 00:48:49.140
 So we were talking about and we all could tell immediately by just the smell of the

00:48:49.140 --> 00:48:51.940
 water, we did blind taste testing, which came from where?

00:48:51.940 --> 00:48:56.940
 You can 100% tell the difference from certain places, like from the difference between Bolton

00:48:56.940 --> 00:49:02.980
 and London is it might as well be a different liquid, it just tastes nothing like it.

00:49:02.980 --> 00:49:06.100
 It's Bolton, sometimes it's because of the rocks, this is because of the chemicals that

00:49:06.100 --> 00:49:08.780
 are added in Oxfordshire, which is more chemicals.

00:49:08.780 --> 00:49:12.660
 With us is because we have soft water in Bolton, but we have hard water in London, which is

00:49:12.660 --> 00:49:16.500
 just like, it might as well be orange juice and lemon juice, it's completely different.

00:49:16.500 --> 00:49:20.420
 I wonder if there's anyone who can tell every single county by the taste of the water.

00:49:20.420 --> 00:49:27.220
 Well, in 2016 they did a taste test of all the different waters in the UK with a group

00:49:27.220 --> 00:49:31.220
 of judges that included Michelin star chef Tom Aitkins.

00:49:31.220 --> 00:49:35.680
 So these were experts on water and they tasted them all and they said that the best tasting

00:49:35.680 --> 00:49:42.500
 tap water was the West Midlands, it was found in the West Midlands and the worst was served

00:49:42.500 --> 00:49:45.940
 by Wessex water, which included bath and Bristol.

00:49:45.940 --> 00:49:53.340
 But that was because the water was polluted by a statue of a slave trader, but now apparently

00:49:53.340 --> 00:49:58.060
 according to, but then you see these every kind of few, every couple of years they come

00:49:58.060 --> 00:50:01.580
 up with a new survey and someone else is the best and someone else is the worst.

00:50:01.580 --> 00:50:02.580
 Yeah.

00:50:02.580 --> 00:50:07.060
 But that's very embarrassing bath, trading on its water presentries.

00:50:07.060 --> 00:50:11.260
 I suppose they're quite sulfurous are they in bath, is that the whole point of the bath?

00:50:11.260 --> 00:50:15.620
 The actual springs are, yeah, that you can buy you to cost 50p for a glass of the actual

00:50:15.620 --> 00:50:19.420
 springs water and it's so eggy, it's really gross.

00:50:19.420 --> 00:50:21.580
 People used to order it by delivery though.

00:50:21.580 --> 00:50:26.220
 So back when bath became a thing, it became, there was the resurgence of bath.

00:50:26.220 --> 00:50:30.620
 So bath was a big deal in Roman times because of the spa and then the 18th and 19th centuries,

00:50:30.620 --> 00:50:34.620
 people like Jane Austen in coast, I had holidaying there to take the waters, which were thought

00:50:34.620 --> 00:50:39.460
 to be very curative and you'd visit to cure your sickness and sometimes it worked because

00:50:39.460 --> 00:50:43.620
 water was very polluted let's say in London, but you visit to cure your sickness, but sometimes

00:50:43.620 --> 00:50:48.180
 people didn't have weeks to spare to go holidaying in bath and that's where the bottled water

00:50:48.180 --> 00:50:49.540
 industry started.

00:50:49.540 --> 00:50:54.180
 So they'd write to bath and say, oh, can I just have water delivered and you'd get subscriptions

00:50:54.180 --> 00:50:56.780
 of spa water delivered to you once a month.

00:50:56.780 --> 00:50:57.780
 Wow.

00:50:57.780 --> 00:50:58.780
 That's amazing.

00:50:58.780 --> 00:51:04.460
 So they also invented the subscription meal service, did they?

00:51:04.460 --> 00:51:11.020
 They did. Podcasts in the 19th century would advertise.

00:51:11.020 --> 00:51:15.580
 Do you know, we talk about the oldest water, the oldest rock, the oldest earth rock.

00:51:15.580 --> 00:51:16.940
 Do you know where they found that?

00:51:16.940 --> 00:51:18.940
 Is it in space?

00:51:18.940 --> 00:51:19.940
 Yes.

00:51:19.940 --> 00:51:20.940
 On the moon?

00:51:20.940 --> 00:51:21.940
 On the moon.

00:51:21.940 --> 00:51:22.940
 Yeah.

00:51:22.940 --> 00:51:27.260
 The oldest rock that they think belongs to the earth and that was formed on the earth

00:51:27.260 --> 00:51:32.420
 was found on the moon by the Apollo 14 crew in 1971.

00:51:32.420 --> 00:51:36.460
 They brought down the load of samples and this particular one has got all the right isotopes

00:51:36.460 --> 00:51:38.900
 or whatever to think that it did come from the earth.

00:51:38.900 --> 00:51:39.900
 Wow.

00:51:39.900 --> 00:51:43.380
 And they reckoned that what happened was an asteroid hit the earth really, really early

00:51:43.380 --> 00:51:49.460
 on in its development and it flew a load of stuff into space and then this kind of went

00:51:49.460 --> 00:51:52.940
 around, went around, went around and eventually landed on the moon when the moon formed.

00:51:52.940 --> 00:51:57.540
 The moon was a lot closer to the earth in those days and then was found by these astronauts

00:51:57.540 --> 00:51:58.700
 in 1971.

00:51:58.700 --> 00:52:00.340
 You would be furious if you were NASA.

00:52:00.340 --> 00:52:03.060
 If you were NASA and you said, "Right, guys, can you bring back some moon rocks?"

00:52:03.060 --> 00:52:06.060
 You don't mind like literally any bloody rock you could find.

00:52:06.060 --> 00:52:08.660
 It's all moon rock, isn't it?

00:52:08.660 --> 00:52:11.060
 Thank God the Apollo 11 astronauts didn't bring it back.

00:52:11.060 --> 00:52:20.540
 That would not have helped the conspiracy theories.

00:52:20.540 --> 00:52:21.780
 Okay, that's it.

00:52:21.780 --> 00:52:22.780
 That is all of our facts.

00:52:22.780 --> 00:52:24.220
 Thank you so much for listening.

00:52:24.220 --> 00:52:27.260

 You can email podcast@QI.com.

00:52:37.660 --> 00:52:43.860
 Yeah, well, you can go to our group account, which is @NoSuchThing or our website, NoSuchThing

00:52:43.860 --> 00:52:45.380
 as a fish.com.

00:52:45.380 --> 00:52:50.100
 We have everything up there from previous episodes to links to our merchandise.

00:52:50.100 --> 00:52:54.460
 As ever, we all hope that you're doing well and that you're safe and thank you so much

00:52:54.460 --> 00:52:57.580
 for continuing to listen to us in this bizarre, bizarre time.

00:52:57.580 --> 00:53:01.900
 We will be back again next week with another one of these great episodes of Facts.

00:53:01.900 --> 00:53:03.140
 And we'll see you then.

00:53:03.140 --> 00:53:04.140
 Goodbye.

00:53:04.140 --> 00:53:18.460
 And in no particular order, here we go.

00:53:18.460 --> 00:53:19.460
 Starting with my facts.

00:53:19.460 --> 00:53:21.660
 Did you just forget the words to the intro?

00:53:21.660 --> 00:53:24.940
 Yeah, I human buffered.

00:53:24.940 --> 00:53:28.220
 It's not the internet.

00:53:28.220 --> 00:53:30.740
 Your brain has been buffering for a long time, hasn't it, Dad?

00:53:30.740 --> 00:53:31.740
 It's really odd.

00:53:31.740 --> 00:53:32.540
 It's a big rainbow wheel.

00:53:32.540 --> 00:53:33.540
 Bye.

00:53:33.540 --> 00:53:34.540
 Bye.

00:53:34.540 --> 00:53:35.540
 Bye.

00:53:35.540 --> 00:53:35.540
 Bye.

00:53:35.540 --> 00:53:36.540
 Bye.

00:53:36.540 --> 00:53:37.540
 Bye.

00:53:37.540 --> 00:53:38.540
 Bye.

00:53:38.540 --> 00:53:39.540
 Bye.

00:53:39.540 --> 00:53:42.120
