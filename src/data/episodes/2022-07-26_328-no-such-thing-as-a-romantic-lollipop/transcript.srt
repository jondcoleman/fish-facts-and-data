 Hello and welcome to another episode of No Such Thing as a Fish, a weekly podcast coming

3
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:24,520
 to you from four undisclosed locations in the UK.

4
00:00:24,520 --> 00:00:28,880
 My name is Dan Schreiber, I am sitting here with Anna Tejinski, Andrew Hunter Murray and

5
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:32,880
 James Harkin and once again we have gathered round the microphones with our four favourite

6
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:37,960
 facts from the last seven days and in no particular order, here we go.

7
00:00:37,960 --> 00:00:41,880
 Starting with fact number one and that is my fact, my fact this week is that the London

8
00:00:41,880 --> 00:00:45,600
 Underground used to have a church interval on Sundays.

9
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:46,600
 Wow.

10
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:51,980
 Yeah, it respected the church, it would stop services during church times.

11
00:00:51,980 --> 00:00:55,320
 Stop services so that you could have a service.

12
00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:57,320
 Very nice and we're off.

13
00:00:57,320 --> 00:01:05,240
 It's a bumpy start but at least we're moving.

14
00:01:05,240 --> 00:01:08,920
 If you were halfway between stations, would it just stop underground and you're trapped

15
00:01:08,920 --> 00:01:11,440
 there having to worship God from the subterranean?

16
00:01:11,440 --> 00:01:13,760
 That's such a good point, I don't know.

17
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:17,400
 I did find a thing called the London Underground Church and I thought, oh great, there's going

18
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:20,200
 to be a church down there but apparently it was a political movement, it was a sort

19
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:23,220
 of like underground in the sense that it wasn't allowed to be known.

20
00:01:23,220 --> 00:01:27,280
 So it was a couple of hours on a Sunday so people could go to church.

21
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:32,800
 Yeah, it was 11 a.m. to 1 p.m. roughly and this is a thing that has existed for a very

22
00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:33,800
 long time.

23
00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:39,120
 So the London Underground, very, very old, the first line opened in 1863 just to put

24
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:44,520
 in context, nine days before that Abraham Lincoln signed the Emancipation Proclamation

25
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:45,520
 in America.

26
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:46,520
 Wow.

27
00:01:46,520 --> 00:01:49,720
 Just to put it in context of how old this is.

28
00:01:49,720 --> 00:01:54,440
 Interestingly though Dan, I know how old the London Underground is, better than I know

29
00:01:54,440 --> 00:01:58,640
 when the Proclamation was signed so it didn't really help me that much.

30
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:00,360
 I think that was more for American listeners.

31
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:01,360
 Got it.

32
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:02,360
 Yeah.

33
00:02:02,360 --> 00:02:03,360
 Got it.

34
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:08,360
 Yeah and it's, so there was a big thing where you had to respect a lot of the church during

35
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:12,200
 those times and one of the things was transport also had to do that and that extended to the

36
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:16,920
 London Underground and that extended all the way till 1900 when I think it was the central

37
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:24,280
 line, was the first line that didn't abide by the church interval and interestingly, famous

38
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:27,080
 celebrity on the first central line ride.

39
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:29,760
 Oh, wait, did you know what year it was?

40
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:30,760
 1900.

41
00:02:30,760 --> 00:02:35,120
 Oh, who was famous in 1900 who we would have heard of today, Gladstone.

42
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:39,000
 It was, this is again for the American listeners, it was an American visiting.

43
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,840
 Oh, Charlie Chaplin.

44
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:42,280
 Who is British but that's cool.

45
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:43,280
 Yep.

46
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:44,280
 Got it.

47
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:45,280
 Cool.

48
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:46,280
 What about Edison?

49
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:47,280
 No, not Edison.

50
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:49,120
 I mean, it's going to be too hard to get.

51
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:50,120
 Henry Ford.

52
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:51,120
 No, not Henry Ford.

53
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:52,120
 No.

54
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:55,840
 It's the Graham Bell, who I appreciate was Scottish, British, spent a lot of his career

55
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:56,840
 in America.

56
00:02:56,840 --> 00:03:01,200
 Alana Sparassette, who is Canadian but a lot of people think she's American.

57
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:05,600
 She's North America, wasn't she?

58
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:08,480
 Is it Freddie Mercury, who was born in Zanzibar?

59
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:12,480
 Ah, very nice.

60
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:14,720
 So we need someone who was alive in 1900.

61
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:15,720
 Let's start with that.

62
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:16,720
 Oh, you're still making his guess.

63
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:17,720
 You're not just going to tell us.

64
00:03:17,720 --> 00:03:18,720
 I've been waiting to tell.

65
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:19,720
 There's so many.

66
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:20,720
 A silent movie star.

67
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:21,720
 A silent movie star.

68
00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:22,720
 Okay.

69
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:23,720
 It was an author.

70
00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:24,720
 Hemingway.

71
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:25,720
 An American author.

72
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:26,720
 Yeah.

73
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:27,720
 Again, 1900, Anna.

74
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:28,720
 Yeah.

75
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:29,720
 He would have been very young.

76
00:03:29,720 --> 00:03:30,720
 He'd have been a top.

77
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:31,720
 He would have been very young.

78
00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:32,720
 Yeah, but.

79
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:33,720
 He got up for free.

80
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:35,720
 They just carried him over the barriers.

81
00:03:35,720 --> 00:03:36,720
 It was fine.

82
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:41,280
 Hemingway could have been a little two-year-old on holiday in Britain at the time.

83
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:42,280
 That's true.

84
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:44,720
 We wouldn't, Dan, put us out.

85
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:45,720
 Mark Twain.

86
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:46,720
 Everybody's misery.

87
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:47,720
 It was Mark Twain.

88
00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:48,720
 Yes.

89
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:49,720
 Yes.

90
00:03:49,720 --> 00:03:50,720
 Wow.

91
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:52,720
 Do we nobody thought of it?

92
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:56,560
 I didn't actually, no, I didn't actually find, but we do know what the Daily Mail reported

93
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:57,560
 about us.

94
00:03:57,560 --> 00:04:02,200
 It said, "Verocious curiosity, astonished satisfaction and solid merit.

95
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:06,560
 If this kind of thing goes on, London will come to be quite a nice place to travel in.

96
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:11,800
 The conductor was all a quiver of joy and pride, but there was no indecorous exhibition

97
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:13,120
 of emotion.

98
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:15,440
 Every man was solidly British."

99
00:04:15,440 --> 00:04:20,240
 These early breaks, though, or these rather, these kind of Sunday trading rules, a lot

100
00:04:20,240 --> 00:04:24,240
 of it, I think, because there used to be trains every day.

101
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:28,880
 They used to be Christmas Day Expresses, and then a lot of the trains had to be axed on

102
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:32,840
 Sundays partly because of religion, but that was a bit of an excuse, really, because a

103
00:04:32,840 --> 00:04:34,880
 lot of it was down to economics.

104
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:38,040
 The fact was there was this thing called the Railway Mania, which sounds like an amazing

105
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:43,400
 time in Britain's history, where every person in the country was invested in or actively

106
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:48,320
 building a railway. And they got all the thousands of railways across the country. And most of

107
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:52,520
 them didn't make any money because they didn't have any passengers. And this was an easy thing

108
00:04:52,520 --> 00:04:57,520
 to act with Sunday trains. And companies were needing to save money in the 1860s. And these

109
00:04:57,520 --> 00:04:59,760
 were lightly used trains. They were an obvious target.

110
00:04:59,760 --> 00:05:04,720
 Yeah. It's a bit like, remember when they opened up directory inquiries and you had

111
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:11,240
 all those different 118 numbers, like 118, 118, or 118, 888, or 118, 111, or 118, 222,

112
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:15,000
 or whatever. It was like, they opened this thing up for anyone with a little bit of money

113
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:19,320
 to think, I can make something big there. And everyone came in and then of course, most

114
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:20,640
 of them just died out.

115
00:05:20,640 --> 00:05:23,040
 But what were the things that you could ring and ask?

116
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:25,960
 Like, what is Andy's phone number?

117
00:05:25,960 --> 00:05:28,960
 I hope no one would tell you that. I hope the only people who could tell you that would

118
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:31,360
 be me with my phone number and you have no idea already.

119
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:34,520
 Well, it's interesting you should say that, Andy, because in the olden days, which you

120
00:05:34,520 --> 00:05:38,480
 won't remember, there used to be phone books that had everyone's phone numbers in them.

121
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:41,920
 I'd be ex-directory. They let you take yourself off though.

122
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:45,080
 They let you take yourself off. Yeah. And if I rang up and said, what's Andy's phone

123
00:05:45,080 --> 00:05:49,080
 number? This is back in the day and you take it and you're taking yourself off. They say,

124
00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:50,080
 oh, he's taken himself off.

125
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:54,880
 My mum definitely still does 118, or she certainly was a couple of years ago. She would ring

126
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:57,840
 up for someone's number and you don't want to be ex-directory because they were always

127
00:05:57,840 --> 00:06:03,040
 pricks if you remember. It was always either your parents were a doctor, which for some

128
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:07,240
 reason was okay, or you're a bit of a dickhead.

129
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:12,400
 On Sunday trading and Sunday hours and things like that, the history of Sunday trading in

130
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:17,360
 Britain is very funny when you look into it. And did explain to me why still, if I ever

131
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:21,240
 go out to buy something on a Sunday, my mum will say, well, I mean, the shops won't be

132
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:27,120
 open. What are you doing? Because, so the Sunday shops act happened in 1950, which basically

133
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:32,440
 said no shops except essentials can open on a Sunday because of church. And it was repealed

134
00:06:32,440 --> 00:06:38,040
 in 1994. But I was reading all these parliamentary debates in the interim, which showed how very

135
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:42,160
 controversial it was because the rules were so convoluted. So for instance, you could

136
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:48,040
 buy essentials. People acknowledged that perishables couldn't wait another day. So you could sell

137
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:49,040
 vegetables.

138
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:52,340
 So there were all these people, for instance, who would have furniture shops. There was

139
00:06:52,340 --> 00:06:58,880
 a case in 1972, Walla vs Hardy, where a furniture shop was selling carrots for £250 each. But

140
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:04,840
 you've got a free item of furniture with your carrot as a free gift to get away with it.

141
00:07:04,840 --> 00:07:09,960
 There was this bizarre rule where fish and chip shops were specifically banned from selling

142
00:07:09,960 --> 00:07:14,480
 fish and chips on a Sunday. But anyone else could sell fish and chips. So a Chinese takeaway

143
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:18,220
 could sell fish and chips, but a fish and chips shop couldn't. But a fish and chip shop

144
00:07:18,220 --> 00:07:23,120
 could sell a Chinese takeaway on a Sunday. It was wild.

145
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:29,080
 There was a thing where you're not allowed to buy dog food, but if you said to the guy

146
00:07:29,080 --> 00:07:33,440
 of the shop, "I have a pony who only eats dog food," you're allowed to buy it because

147
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:36,280
 you're allowed to buy pony food. And it didn't say...

148
00:07:36,280 --> 00:07:39,720
 Oh, because dogs are very religious, but I think horses aren't, are they?

149
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:45,800
 That's right, yeah. That's insane. I found out about a sex shop in Cheshire called the

150
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:52,000
 Private Shop. And in 2014, they were applying to be allowed to trade on a Sunday, right?

151
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:56,120
 And they were not allowed to do so, but they were granted permission to leave the door

152
00:07:56,120 --> 00:07:58,000
 slightly open. Right.

153
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:04,160
 But the thing is, I bought a carrot from there for $5.99, and they gave me a free dildo.

154
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:10,400
 Well, that's two dildos for the price of one. That's great, yeah.

155
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:18,160
 I'm not going round to y'alls for Sunday lunch.

156
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:23,880
 In 1816 in Massachusetts, there was a guy who was called George Pierce, who was arrested

157
00:08:23,880 --> 00:08:27,760
 for riding on a Sunday, because in America, you weren't allowed to ride your horse on

158
00:08:27,760 --> 00:08:32,760
 a Sunday. He was arrested as acting against the peace and dignity of the Commonwealth of

159
00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:37,680
 Massachusetts, and he was put in prison, and then he was only let out on a Monday. But then

160
00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:41,960
 he sued the officer for false arrest because he said, "Yeah, you're not allowed to do anything

161
00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:49,620
 on Sundays, including arresting me." And he won his court case, and he got $500 of damages

162
00:08:49,620 --> 00:08:52,360
 from the police officer for arresting him.

163
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:53,360
 Wow.

164
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:54,360
 Brilliant move.

165
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:55,360
 That's great.

166
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:59,920
 I read a bizarre thing that this is just things that were banned in the UK on Sundays. It was

167
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:06,680
 in, for about 28 years, roughly, in the 16th century, it was made illegal to not wear a

168
00:09:06,680 --> 00:09:13,320
 woolen cap on a Sunday. And this was not for all parts of society, but it was predominantly

169
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:16,640
 for the people who couldn't afford to pay the fight.

170
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:23,400
 So Queen Elizabeth basically put a law in place where she said that maids, ladies, gentlemen,

171
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:28,560
 noble personages, and every Lord, Knight, and gentleman of 20 marks land were exempt

172
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:33,240
 from having to wear this hat, but everyone else had to wear a woolen hat on a Sunday

173
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:38,280
 in the UK. And if you were caught not wearing it, you would be fined so much that you probably

174
00:09:38,280 --> 00:09:41,760
 couldn't afford it and then would have to do jail time. So there was a huge risk to

175
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:42,760
 it.

176
00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:45,160
 And the reason was to help the woolen industry, right?

177
00:09:45,160 --> 00:09:46,160
 Yeah, exactly.

178
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:47,160
 Yeah.

179
00:09:47,160 --> 00:09:48,640
 What are you in for?

180
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:53,640
 Well, I think you can see.

181
00:09:53,640 --> 00:09:57,360
 That's very hot in summer.

182
00:09:57,360 --> 00:09:58,360
 Yeah.

183
00:09:58,360 --> 00:09:59,360
 Yes.

184
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:03,080
 Were there regulations about the size of the woolen cap? Could you basically wear a very

185
00:10:03,080 --> 00:10:05,240
 small sort of button size woolen cap?

186
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:12,240
 I think it was a very specific design. It was a sort of uniform style bubble hat that

187
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:13,240
 you would have to wear.

188
00:10:13,240 --> 00:10:18,680
 Yeah. That's been quite a common way of policing these kind of Sunday laws is to find people

189
00:10:18,680 --> 00:10:24,240
 for not doing it. In 1581, it was the law that you had to go to church every Sunday.

190
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:28,080
 Everyone in the country had to go to church. And if you decided you didn't want to, you

191
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:34,720
 had to pay a fine of £20 per month. And that was 20 times the average monthly wage. So

192
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:39,920
 it would take you almost two years to earn that fine if you didn't do it.

193
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:42,920
 Oh, my God, yeah.

194
00:10:42,920 --> 00:10:46,880
 Just while you mentioned church ceremonies, I found out about the longest church service

195
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:49,160
 because this fact is about church intervals.

196
00:10:49,160 --> 00:10:50,160
 Okay.

197
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:51,960
 Have you heard of the Sigwee?

198
00:10:51,960 --> 00:10:53,560
 Sigwee, don't think so.

199
00:10:53,560 --> 00:10:55,000
 Are you trying to do a Segway?

200
00:10:55,000 --> 00:11:00,720
 No. I am trying to do a Segway into a fact about the Sigwee, but that is just a coincidence.

201
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:07,680
 This is a mask festival held by the Dogon people of Mali. And it's the last one lasted

202
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:08,680
 for six years.

203
00:11:08,680 --> 00:11:09,680
 Come on.

204
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:12,680
 So it's a long service.

205
00:11:12,680 --> 00:11:16,280
 I'm not sure you have to spend all your time at it. It's not like a sermon that lasts for

206
00:11:16,280 --> 00:11:21,800
 six years, but you have to carve a great mask and several meters long these masks sometimes.

207
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:26,300
 And then you have to perform what the Guinness Book of Records calls a time-consuming procession

208
00:11:26,300 --> 00:11:28,160
 of dances from village to village.

209
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:29,160
 Wow.

210
00:11:29,160 --> 00:11:31,320
 And yeah, they're not doing another one until 2037.

211
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:35,680
 I was wondering if Southern Rail have been on a church interval for the Dogon people

212
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:39,160
 of Mali for the last seven years.

213
00:11:39,160 --> 00:11:44,560
 Okay, it is time for fact number two, and that is James.

214
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:50,000
 Okay, my fact this week is that the first ice cream on a stick was called the Good Humour

215
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,000
 Bar.

216
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:56,520
 It's a modified version of a lollipop called the Jolly Boy Sucker.

217
00:11:56,520 --> 00:11:58,400
 You said that like the Jolly Boy Sucker.

218
00:11:58,400 --> 00:12:01,640
 Well, I would say it was the Jolly Boy Sucker.

219
00:12:01,640 --> 00:12:03,200
 There's no punctuation.

220
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:04,440
 So I don't really know.

221
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:07,840
 I don't know how to say it's in the eye of the beholder, isn't it?

222
00:12:07,840 --> 00:12:14,140
 So this is the weather outside at the moment as we record is absolutely sweltering.

223
00:12:14,140 --> 00:12:19,500
 So I thought we could do a fact about ice creams and this is about ice creams on a stick.

224
00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:23,960
 So things like I don't know, magnums or mini milks or whatever you would have.

225
00:12:23,960 --> 00:12:27,160
 And they were invented in around 1923.

226
00:12:27,160 --> 00:12:32,000
 So a few years earlier, Harry Burt, who is a guy from Ohio, he'd put a lollipop on a

227
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:37,960
 stick which he called the Jolly Boy Sucker and his son suggested adding ice cream on

228
00:12:37,960 --> 00:12:42,280
 the outside of it and maybe a chocolate covering and it became really popular.

229
00:12:42,280 --> 00:12:46,880
 And he called it Good Humour because he thought that your mood was related to your sense of

230
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:47,880
 taste.

231
00:12:47,880 --> 00:12:50,580
 If you tasted something really good, you'd always be in a good mood and if you tasted

232
00:12:50,580 --> 00:12:52,780
 something bad, you would always be in a bad mood.

233
00:12:52,780 --> 00:12:53,780
 Hang on.

234
00:12:53,780 --> 00:12:58,040
 Is that like the medieval theory of the four humans where if you're too choleric, you have

235
00:12:58,040 --> 00:12:59,360
 too much bile?

236
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:03,880
 I don't think when he called it Good Humour, he thought it has half a bit of cholera, half

237
00:13:03,880 --> 00:13:06,180
 a bit of bile, half a bit of blood.

238
00:13:06,180 --> 00:13:07,700
 I don't think he thought that.

239
00:13:07,700 --> 00:13:11,580
 But actually Good Humour, I didn't know this because I haven't spent much time in America,

240
00:13:11,580 --> 00:13:13,140
 but it's quite a big brand in America.

241
00:13:13,140 --> 00:13:14,660
 It's owned by Unilever, I think.

242
00:13:14,660 --> 00:13:19,760
 Yeah, I don't know it by name, but I recognize the logo as almost a childhood ice cream,

243
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:20,760
 bizarrely.

244
00:13:20,760 --> 00:13:22,440
 So sorry, was there a lolly?

245
00:13:22,440 --> 00:13:25,840
 Was it like he kept the lolly inside, did you say?

246
00:13:25,840 --> 00:13:29,400
 So you break the chocolate and then the ice cream and then you chow down on a rock hard

247
00:13:29,400 --> 00:13:30,400
 piece of candy.

248
00:13:30,400 --> 00:13:31,400
 Oh, I did.

249
00:13:31,400 --> 00:13:32,400
 That's amazing.

250
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:33,400
 That's good, isn't it?

251
00:13:33,400 --> 00:13:34,400
 Do you remember those?

252
00:13:34,400 --> 00:13:35,400
 What were they called?

253
00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:37,840
 You used to get ice creams where you had some bubble gum at the bottom.

254
00:13:37,840 --> 00:13:38,840
 It's a bit like that.

255
00:13:38,840 --> 00:13:39,840
 Oh, cool.

256
00:13:39,840 --> 00:13:42,280
 You guys are all too young to remember these things, but...

257
00:13:42,280 --> 00:13:45,580
 Well, Anna's mum will text 118, 118 and find out what it was.

258
00:13:45,580 --> 00:13:50,020
 This whole class is going to be me reminiscing about the ice creams of my youth and you guys

259
00:13:50,020 --> 00:13:54,620
 going, "Oh, we only have carnettos."

260
00:13:54,620 --> 00:13:56,540
 These Good Humour bars, they were kind of...

261
00:13:56,540 --> 00:14:00,980
 They were seen as very proper and sort of very...

262
00:14:00,980 --> 00:14:02,380
 The firm was seen as a very moral one.

263
00:14:02,380 --> 00:14:06,780
 So there was a book about ice cream, which I looked at a bit of, called Sweet Spot.

264
00:14:06,780 --> 00:14:10,420
 And it has this to say about the Good Humour trucks, because he kind of invented the ice

265
00:14:10,420 --> 00:14:12,400
 cream truck in a way as well.

266
00:14:12,400 --> 00:14:16,680
 It said, "The white shirt and the cap the drivers sported help create a mythology around

267
00:14:16,680 --> 00:14:20,560
 the Good Humour brand of trustworthiness and dependability.

268
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:26,520
 That lasted until the mid-1970s when the Brooklyn District Attorney's Office filed a 244 count

269
00:14:26,520 --> 00:14:31,640
 indictment of Good Humour, charging the company with falsifying records to hide excessive amounts

270
00:14:31,640 --> 00:14:32,640
 of bacteria."

271
00:14:32,640 --> 00:14:33,640
 What?

272
00:14:33,640 --> 00:14:34,640
 Really?

273
00:14:34,640 --> 00:14:35,640
 Wow.

274
00:14:35,640 --> 00:14:37,640
 That was a long time ago, though, we should say.

275
00:14:37,640 --> 00:14:38,640
 Yes.

276
00:14:38,640 --> 00:14:39,640
 Very long time ago.

277
00:14:39,640 --> 00:14:44,700
 The origins of, as you say, like the ice cream truck, and they really cared about the presentation

278
00:14:44,700 --> 00:14:46,700
 of how they were going through the community.

279
00:14:46,700 --> 00:14:52,660
 So anyone who became a Good Humour man, which became quite a culturally significant role,

280
00:14:52,660 --> 00:14:57,220
 there was movies made using that title, The Good Humour Man, later on, they all had to

281
00:14:57,220 --> 00:15:01,460
 go and do courses to learn how to be the best version of that role.

282
00:15:01,460 --> 00:15:05,100
 So there was a two to three day course that you would go on.

283
00:15:05,100 --> 00:15:09,180
 They were taught to always tip their hat towards a lady if they came towards them.

284
00:15:09,180 --> 00:15:11,080
 And if they didn't do that, they would be fired.

285
00:15:11,080 --> 00:15:13,760
 And they had to say, "Ice cream, Good Humour."

286
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:16,800
 If they said, "Good Humour, Ice Cream," that was the improper way of saying it.

287
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:18,680
 And that could lead to them being fired as well.

288
00:15:18,680 --> 00:15:19,680
 That was quite good.

289
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:20,680
 Yeah.

290
00:15:20,680 --> 00:15:23,000
 There was a handbook called Making Good at Good Humour that they all had to study in

291
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:27,400
 order to become this representative of the company.

292
00:15:27,400 --> 00:15:31,440
 Don't forget, Dan, they also had to falsify records to hide excessive amounts of bacteria

293
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:32,440
 in the product.

294
00:15:32,440 --> 00:15:34,920
 Do you know what people's favourite ice lolly is today?

295
00:15:34,920 --> 00:15:36,720
 I was quite surprised by this.

296
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:38,280
 Also lolly or ice cream?

297
00:15:38,280 --> 00:15:39,500
 Ice cream or lolly on a stick?

298
00:15:39,500 --> 00:15:41,540
 Anything cold on a stick?

299
00:15:41,540 --> 00:15:42,540
 Cold on a stick.

300
00:15:42,540 --> 00:15:43,540
 Magnum.

301
00:15:43,540 --> 00:15:44,540
 Yeah, I understand.

302
00:15:44,540 --> 00:15:45,540
 Oh, you straight away went for Magnum.

303
00:15:45,540 --> 00:15:46,540
 Okay.

304
00:15:46,540 --> 00:15:47,540
 It's Magnum.

305
00:15:47,540 --> 00:15:48,540
 It's bang on Magnum.

306
00:15:48,540 --> 00:15:49,540
 What is that rabbit?

307
00:15:49,540 --> 00:15:53,500
 28% of the country think they're the best, and the runner-up is on like 8%.

308
00:15:53,500 --> 00:15:56,820
 I think it's because it's not very easy to remember any others.

309
00:15:56,820 --> 00:15:57,820
 Yeah.

310
00:15:57,820 --> 00:15:58,820
 Do you think?

311
00:15:58,820 --> 00:15:59,820
 You're right.

312
00:15:59,820 --> 00:16:00,820
 Yeah.

313
00:16:00,820 --> 00:16:01,820
 I would go feast.

314
00:16:01,820 --> 00:16:02,820
 Absolutely, yeah.

315
00:16:02,820 --> 00:16:03,820
 Feast any day of the week.

316
00:16:03,820 --> 00:16:04,820
 Yeah, feast is great.

317
00:16:04,820 --> 00:16:05,820
 But Magnum in...

318
00:16:05,820 --> 00:16:06,820
 But it's not a market leader in the way that Magnum is.

319
00:16:06,820 --> 00:16:09,700
 I think saying, "What's your favourite flavour of cola?"

320
00:16:09,700 --> 00:16:13,060
 You're only going to get people to say Pepsi or Coca-Cola at you.

321
00:16:13,060 --> 00:16:14,560
 That's true.

322
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:20,820
 Well, anyway, it might be so popular because they invented a new kind of chocolate for

323
00:16:20,820 --> 00:16:21,820
 the Magnum.

324
00:16:21,820 --> 00:16:22,820
 Oh, really?

325
00:16:22,820 --> 00:16:24,220
 Which is a really exciting move.

326
00:16:24,220 --> 00:16:29,320
 They've only been around since the very late '80s, I think, and basically the problem

327
00:16:29,320 --> 00:16:34,220
 was that chocolate cracks at a certain low temperature, so it was actually very hard

328
00:16:34,220 --> 00:16:36,740
 to get good quality chocolate around ice cream.

329
00:16:36,740 --> 00:16:41,100
 And they created this new kind of chocolate that didn't break at minus 40 degrees.

330
00:16:41,100 --> 00:16:46,980
 And I read this weird blog by a business analyst, which was saying that Magnum is the epitome

331
00:16:46,980 --> 00:16:49,460
 of good business because of its simplicity.

332
00:16:49,460 --> 00:16:54,980
 And then when they brought along the new flavours like cherry, gavara, John Lemon, woodchock

333
00:16:54,980 --> 00:17:00,500
 and jammy Hendrix, none of which I knew existed, they described them as the four horsemen

334
00:17:00,500 --> 00:17:01,500
 of the apocalypse.

335
00:17:01,500 --> 00:17:02,500
 Wow.

336
00:17:02,500 --> 00:17:03,500
 Wow.

337
00:17:03,500 --> 00:17:04,740
 I don't think we've ever mentioned this before.

338
00:17:04,740 --> 00:17:10,340
 There is quite a widely known claim that Roger Moore, James Bond, invented the Magnum.

339
00:17:10,340 --> 00:17:11,340
 Yes.

340
00:17:11,340 --> 00:17:12,340
 Okay.

341
00:17:12,340 --> 00:17:16,220
 And it's because he was being interviewed in the 1960s and he was asked, if you could

342
00:17:16,220 --> 00:17:18,580
 ask one person any question, what would it be?

343
00:17:18,580 --> 00:17:21,700
 And he said, "I would like to meet Mr. Walls of Walls Ice Cream and say, why don't you

344
00:17:21,700 --> 00:17:23,940
 do a chalk ice with vanilla on a stick?"

345
00:17:23,940 --> 00:17:24,940
 Ah.

346
00:17:24,940 --> 00:17:28,220
 And he also said, "I didn't realise that other people at the time said they wanted to meet

347
00:17:28,220 --> 00:17:29,220
 Gandhi or Jesus."

348
00:17:29,220 --> 00:17:31,460
 That was his answer.

349
00:17:31,460 --> 00:17:37,400
 Anyway, Walls sent him a cake which had plain chocolate on the outside and vanilla ice cream

350
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:38,540
 on the inside.

351
00:17:38,540 --> 00:17:42,420
 And this later got parlayed into he invented the concept of the Magnum.

352
00:17:42,420 --> 00:17:46,900
 Anyway, the Magnum was eventually made 23 years later, give or take.

353
00:17:46,900 --> 00:17:47,900
 Okay.

354
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:48,900
 Well, he was ahead of his time.

355
00:17:48,900 --> 00:17:49,900
 Yeah.

356
00:17:49,900 --> 00:17:55,540
 A spokeswoman for Unilever told the son who asked them about it, "Sadly, we've never heard

357
00:17:55,540 --> 00:17:58,860
 this brilliant story, but we are thrilled to hear the late great Sir Roger Moore was

358
00:17:58,860 --> 00:18:00,040
 a fan of Magnum."

359
00:18:00,040 --> 00:18:03,540
 Very carefully saying, "There's no truth in this measure at all."

360
00:18:03,540 --> 00:18:08,580
 I believe it, because it often takes a long time between the prototype, like Alexander

361
00:18:08,580 --> 00:18:09,940
 Fleming discovered penicillin.

362
00:18:09,940 --> 00:18:14,740
 It was a long time before he was able to market it, so probably in the same way, that first

363
00:18:14,740 --> 00:18:19,060
 Magnum cake, you know, there was, of course, there was a gap before they could make it

364
00:18:19,060 --> 00:18:20,060
 possible.

365
00:18:20,060 --> 00:18:21,060
 Well, didn't...

366
00:18:21,060 --> 00:18:22,060
 A Magnum cake sounds great.

367
00:18:22,060 --> 00:18:26,660
 Didn't Harry Burt spend three years trying to get his good humour bar patented as well?

368
00:18:26,660 --> 00:18:27,660
 Yeah.

369
00:18:27,660 --> 00:18:31,020
 One was granting the patent, and I think he eventually went down to the patent office

370
00:18:31,020 --> 00:18:36,140
 with the ice cream and gave out samples, and then according to the story of Good Humour's

371
00:18:36,140 --> 00:18:39,340
 official website, that's when they were granted the patent.

372
00:18:39,340 --> 00:18:40,340
 Yeah.

373
00:18:40,340 --> 00:18:44,660
 He apparently had a five-gallon bucket of these ice creams and just handed them out to absolutely

374
00:18:44,660 --> 00:18:47,820
 everyone who could make a decision.

375
00:18:47,820 --> 00:18:51,740
 We were just talking about walls, which is kind of the UK version of Good Humour, because

376
00:18:51,740 --> 00:18:54,100
 they're both owned by Unilever.

377
00:18:54,100 --> 00:18:57,580
 They started around the start of the 19th century.

378
00:18:57,580 --> 00:19:03,660
 In 1812, George the Prince of Wales granted Richard Wall a royal warrant as the purveyor

379
00:19:03,660 --> 00:19:07,060
 of pork to the king, and that's where they started.

380
00:19:07,060 --> 00:19:13,300
 He was the official royal purveyor of pork, and it was because he had a shop on German

381
00:19:13,300 --> 00:19:18,940
 Street in London where he could make sausages, and no one really else could make as good

382
00:19:18,940 --> 00:19:23,460
 sausages as him, because he had this machine, and it was a donkey that would walk around

383
00:19:23,460 --> 00:19:29,540
 the machine, and it would create a cutting motion that would turn the meat into mincemeat,

384
00:19:29,540 --> 00:19:35,180
 which he could then turn into sausages, which he could then purve pork-like to the king.

385
00:19:35,180 --> 00:19:39,300
 That's amazing, because these days, a technical edge is having a better factory that makes

386
00:19:39,300 --> 00:19:44,180
 microprocessors more effectively, and in those days, the commercial edge was just your donkey

387
00:19:44,180 --> 00:19:46,740
 on a street.

388
00:19:46,740 --> 00:19:52,660
 Then in 1913, they came up the idea, because what would happen is, in the summer, no one

389
00:19:52,660 --> 00:19:57,020
 wanted pork anymore, because it was too hot for pork, and they were like, have to lay

390
00:19:57,020 --> 00:20:02,180
 people off, and so they came up with the idea of making ice creams, because they had refrigeration,

391
00:20:02,180 --> 00:20:06,180
 so they came up with the idea of making ice creams to avoid layoffs, and that's when they

392
00:20:06,180 --> 00:20:09,940
 became this big, probably the biggest ice cream company in the UK.

393
00:20:09,940 --> 00:20:15,060
 I thought you were going to say that they sold frozen pork for people to sell, and that was

394
00:20:15,060 --> 00:20:17,140
 how they part-laid it in.

395
00:20:17,140 --> 00:20:24,620
 The Magnum used to be a flat sausage on a stick, and the thing was, he also sent people

396
00:20:24,620 --> 00:20:28,780
 around in an early ice cream van way.

397
00:20:28,780 --> 00:20:33,700
 They had tricycles with the ice creams in, and they had the slogan, "Stop me and buy

398
00:20:33,700 --> 00:20:38,660
 one," which still exists today, but he would let them go on a Sunday when most people wouldn't

399
00:20:38,660 --> 00:20:40,180
 let people work on a Sunday.

400
00:20:40,180 --> 00:20:44,100
 He would let his ice cream sellers go on a Sunday, but he said that they would only let

401
00:20:44,100 --> 00:20:49,220
 them do it if they went to church in the morning, and it was under his supervision, so they

402
00:20:49,220 --> 00:20:52,620
 had to go to church with him in the morning, and if they did, then they could sell the

403
00:20:52,620 --> 00:20:56,140
 ice creams in the afternoon.

404
00:20:56,140 --> 00:21:00,460
 Just a little ice cream news story I found in the process of this.

405
00:21:00,460 --> 00:21:04,900
 In 2018, a man called Mr. Tickle was arrested for threatening an ice cream van owner with

406
00:21:04,900 --> 00:21:09,140
 a samurai sword while high on cocaine.

407
00:21:09,140 --> 00:21:13,740
 That started off so risible with Mr. Tickle, and then it went dark really quickly.

408
00:21:13,740 --> 00:21:15,380
 It's actually an awful story.

409
00:21:15,380 --> 00:21:16,380
 There were children present.

410
00:21:16,380 --> 00:21:17,940
 It was incredibly upsetting for them.

411
00:21:17,940 --> 00:21:20,180
 He later went unhid by some bins before being arrested.

412
00:21:20,180 --> 00:21:25,780
 Unfortunately, they saw his really long arms poking out from the bins, didn't they?

413
00:21:25,780 --> 00:21:31,460
 He put up his hands to the cups, knocked down some aeroplanes.

414
00:21:31,460 --> 00:21:35,540
 Anyway, it's probably too inappropriate, because, yeah, he did threaten the van owner

415
00:21:35,540 --> 00:21:36,540
 with it.

416
00:21:36,540 --> 00:21:37,540
 He was called Jamie Tickle.

417
00:21:37,540 --> 00:21:38,540
 Okay.

418
00:21:38,540 --> 00:21:39,540
 That's all right?

419
00:21:39,540 --> 00:21:40,540
 Okay.

420
00:21:40,540 --> 00:21:41,540
 No one died?

421
00:21:41,540 --> 00:21:45,580
 No, I just don't want him to come and find me.

422
00:21:45,580 --> 00:21:46,580
 It's all right.

423
00:21:46,580 --> 00:21:50,780
 He'll get stopped by the long arm of the last.

424
00:21:50,780 --> 00:21:54,700
 I've got a 2008 press release that I can tell you about.

425
00:21:54,700 --> 00:21:59,860
 You guys are too young to remember this, but until 1988, all lollipop sticks had jokes

426
00:21:59,860 --> 00:22:00,860
 on them.

427
00:22:00,860 --> 00:22:01,860
 Oh, yeah.

428
00:22:01,860 --> 00:22:04,820
 So whenever you wet your magnum, when you got to the end of it, you could read the little

429
00:22:04,820 --> 00:22:06,220
 joke on the sticks.

430
00:22:06,220 --> 00:22:10,700
 They were phased out in 1988 because they thought that people who were eating ice cream

431
00:22:10,700 --> 00:22:12,420
 were becoming a bit more sophisticated.

432
00:22:12,420 --> 00:22:15,980
 They didn't think that the jokes were appropriate anymore.

433
00:22:15,980 --> 00:22:17,300
 Wait, this is so weird, James.

434
00:22:17,300 --> 00:22:20,900
 I thought I remembered that, but I was not in a position to read lollipop stick jokes

435
00:22:20,900 --> 00:22:21,900
 in 1988.

436
00:22:21,900 --> 00:22:26,500
 It's possible your parents had a lot of out-of-date ice creams that they were giving you.

437
00:22:26,500 --> 00:22:28,300
 I think that must be it.

438
00:22:28,300 --> 00:22:29,580
 No more parents, that is likely.

439
00:22:29,580 --> 00:22:33,300
 They phased them out in 1988, so I suppose there might have been a few stragglers a bit

440
00:22:33,300 --> 00:22:37,460
 later, but maybe the kids ones, like Minnie Milks, might have kept them on.

441
00:22:37,460 --> 00:22:43,940
 So in 2008, Walls approached James Corden to start a new career, writing jokes for

442
00:22:43,940 --> 00:22:47,620
 ice cream sticks because they wanted to bring them back.

443
00:22:47,620 --> 00:22:51,980
 They said that he would be ideal because James is an up-and-coming comedian who is

444
00:22:51,980 --> 00:22:52,980
 cutting edge.

445
00:22:52,980 --> 00:22:53,980
 Yeah.

446
00:22:53,980 --> 00:22:55,980
 Surely that's a miscareer opportunity for James.

447
00:22:55,980 --> 00:22:56,980
 I know.

448
00:22:56,980 --> 00:22:57,980
 We don't know if he said no yet, Hannah.

449
00:22:57,980 --> 00:22:58,980
 We don't know if he said no.

450
00:22:58,980 --> 00:22:59,980
 You're right.

451
00:22:59,980 --> 00:23:02,380
 Well, I think he did say no.

452
00:23:02,380 --> 00:23:03,780
 But where is he now?

453
00:23:03,780 --> 00:23:04,780
 Where is he now?

454
00:23:04,780 --> 00:23:05,780
 Where is he now?

455
00:23:05,780 --> 00:23:06,780
 Yeah.

456
00:23:06,780 --> 00:23:11,700
 So what they phased out in the '80s, which only James will remember, is the double popsicle.

457
00:23:11,700 --> 00:23:15,220
 Actually, I think this was in America, but I didn't know these were such things.

458
00:23:15,220 --> 00:23:16,220
 I remember those.

459
00:23:16,220 --> 00:23:18,860
 Like, is it an ice lolly with two sticks?

460
00:23:18,860 --> 00:23:20,180
 It's a lollipop with two sticks.

461
00:23:20,180 --> 00:23:21,180
 Oh, right.

462
00:23:21,180 --> 00:23:22,180
 No, I don't remember that.

463
00:23:22,180 --> 00:23:27,100
 These were actually a ploy in the Great Depression to sell more people lollipops.

464
00:23:27,100 --> 00:23:29,660
 So it was invented so that they could sell two for the price of one.

465
00:23:29,660 --> 00:23:33,660
 So the idea, a public health nightmare, you'll agree, is that you would share a lollipop,

466
00:23:33,660 --> 00:23:38,980
 so you'd buy one lolly, but you have two sticks, so two people can share it and they hold it.

467
00:23:38,980 --> 00:23:41,900
 You're each holding a stick and eating it.

468
00:23:41,900 --> 00:23:42,900
 Your mouths are right next to each other.

469
00:23:42,900 --> 00:23:45,500
 Well, he's like a lady in the tram moment, just a lot longer.

470
00:23:45,500 --> 00:23:46,500
 That's a much longer scene.

471
00:23:46,500 --> 00:23:47,500
 Yeah.

472
00:23:47,500 --> 00:23:48,500
 That was it.

473
00:23:48,500 --> 00:23:53,820
 They both lick either side of this lollipop until eventually they both get to this final

474
00:23:53,820 --> 00:23:58,820
 sliver of lolly where they lick the final bit and then eventually, romantically, they're

475
00:23:58,820 --> 00:24:02,660
 licking each other's tongues.

476
00:24:02,660 --> 00:24:08,660
 This is how romance happens in the '20s, I'm telling you, but over the years, I think

477
00:24:08,660 --> 00:24:13,660
 people forgot that it was meant for two people and so it just became a lolly with two sticks

478
00:24:13,660 --> 00:24:14,660
 on it.

479
00:24:14,660 --> 00:24:15,660
 Sorry.

480
00:24:15,660 --> 00:24:19,320
 You know, in Lady and the Tramp, he basically pretends that he doesn't know what's happening,

481
00:24:19,320 --> 00:24:20,320
 right?

482
00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:23,340
 He's just eating this spaghetti and he pretends he doesn't know what's happening and he turns

483
00:24:23,340 --> 00:24:26,460
 around and he's like, "Oh, now I've got to kiss the other dog.

484
00:24:26,460 --> 00:24:29,300
 I don't think you could pull that off if you're licking a lollipop."

485
00:24:29,300 --> 00:24:32,540
 No, because you'd see that there's no flex and give.

486
00:24:32,540 --> 00:24:33,540
 Like there is in the spaghetti.

487
00:24:33,540 --> 00:24:34,540
 Yeah.

488
00:24:34,540 --> 00:24:36,740
 You're looking dead into the other person's eyes for several minutes while you lick his

489
00:24:36,740 --> 00:24:37,740
 eyes.

490
00:24:37,740 --> 00:24:38,740
 Literally.

491
00:24:38,740 --> 00:24:42,780
 At the very start, everyone knows what they're getting themselves into.

492
00:24:42,780 --> 00:24:46,940
 Well, actually, scientists worked out precisely how many licks it takes to lick a lollipop

493
00:24:46,940 --> 00:24:47,940
 to the end.

494
00:24:47,940 --> 00:24:48,940
 To the tongue touching face.

495
00:24:48,940 --> 00:24:49,940
 They're really scientists.

496
00:24:49,940 --> 00:24:50,940
 Which scientists are these, Anna?

497
00:24:50,940 --> 00:24:52,780
 I just want to defend the scientists.

498
00:24:52,780 --> 00:24:55,660
 They did a very important experiment and then they thought, "How are we going to get the

499
00:24:55,660 --> 00:24:56,940
 press to pick up on this?"

500
00:24:56,940 --> 00:25:02,060
 Well, we can use this experiment to also work out how many licks to lick a lolly.

501
00:25:02,060 --> 00:25:06,540
 So they cooked up this hard candy and they had water currents flow over it.

502
00:25:06,540 --> 00:25:10,780
 And then they calculated that it would take 2,500 licks to lick a lolly.

503
00:25:10,780 --> 00:25:16,660
 It's 1,000 licks per centimetre, which I think is extraordinary and flawed because we have

504
00:25:16,660 --> 00:25:17,660
 saliva, right?

505
00:25:17,660 --> 00:25:19,700
 Whereas they were using water currents.

506
00:25:19,700 --> 00:25:22,380
 So our saliva is much more abrasive.

507
00:25:22,380 --> 00:25:23,380
 Yeah.

508
00:25:23,380 --> 00:25:24,380
 Okay.

509
00:25:24,380 --> 00:25:25,380
 You'd think so.

510
00:25:25,380 --> 00:25:26,380
 Lot of licks though, is what we're saying.

511
00:25:26,380 --> 00:25:29,500
 Just to take us back to the lady of the trap, I think that means that you're licking for

512
00:25:29,500 --> 00:25:33,020
 40 minutes before you eventually lick each other's tongues.

513
00:25:33,020 --> 00:25:34,020
 It's a long scene.

514
00:25:34,020 --> 00:25:40,420
 Yeah, there's a director's cut available where you can actually see that original scene.

515
00:25:40,420 --> 00:25:46,900
 Okay, it is time for fact number three and that is Anna.

516
00:25:46,900 --> 00:25:52,100
 My fact this week is that Kublai Khan's summer palace could be dismantled and folded away

517
00:25:52,100 --> 00:25:54,100
 at the end of every summer.

518
00:25:54,100 --> 00:25:55,100
 Aw.

519
00:25:55,100 --> 00:25:56,220
 It was clever.

520
00:25:56,220 --> 00:25:57,220
 Like a camping trip.

521
00:25:57,220 --> 00:25:58,220
 Exactly.

522
00:25:58,220 --> 00:25:59,220
 Yeah.

523
00:25:59,220 --> 00:26:00,580
 It went on a big long camping trip.

524
00:26:00,580 --> 00:26:02,700
 It's sort of everyone's nightmare, except Kublai Khan.

525
00:26:02,700 --> 00:26:03,700
 He likes it.

526
00:26:03,700 --> 00:26:07,420
 Did they have that same problem of once they dismantled it, fitting it into the bag that

527
00:26:07,420 --> 00:26:10,020
 it just only seemed too big to get into?

528
00:26:10,020 --> 00:26:11,020
 He could never do it.

529
00:26:11,020 --> 00:26:15,260
 He was always to be heard, "Roll it, don't scrunch it."

530
00:26:15,260 --> 00:26:16,260
 It was a nightmare.

531
00:26:16,260 --> 00:26:21,460
 So this was in, it was Kublai Khan, who was the grandson of Genghis and extended his

532
00:26:21,460 --> 00:26:22,460
 empire.

533
00:26:22,460 --> 00:26:25,700
 So we're talking the second half of the 13th century.

534
00:26:25,700 --> 00:26:32,020
 And he had a summer capital in Shandu, or made famous as Zanadu, of course by Coleridge

535
00:26:32,020 --> 00:26:35,420
 in his poem, but it was called Shandu.

536
00:26:35,420 --> 00:26:39,500
 And in his summer capital, he had this big palace and it was apparently, you know, really

537
00:26:39,500 --> 00:26:42,020
 ornate, amazing palace, huge.

538
00:26:42,020 --> 00:26:46,860
 And it was based on the Mongolian kind of yurt or guh design.

539
00:26:46,860 --> 00:26:47,860
 So they all had guhs.

540
00:26:47,860 --> 00:26:49,780
 They were very nomadic people.

541
00:26:49,780 --> 00:26:53,820
 And so it was held up by 200 silk cords and at the end of the season, you release the

542
00:26:53,820 --> 00:26:56,020
 cords and the whole thing folds up.

543
00:26:56,020 --> 00:26:59,260
 Although I don't know how, because it was made of proper materials, it was made of

544
00:26:59,260 --> 00:27:00,260
 canvas.

545
00:27:00,260 --> 00:27:04,820
 It was made of like cane and it had these huge pillars and stone dragons on top of it.

546
00:27:04,820 --> 00:27:05,820
 And domes.

547
00:27:05,820 --> 00:27:06,820
 Yeah.

548
00:27:06,820 --> 00:27:09,060
 There's a lot of solid stuff to go in that bag.

549
00:27:09,060 --> 00:27:10,060
 Yeah.

550
00:27:10,060 --> 00:27:17,300
 So Kublai Khan, we should say that we largely know this from Marco Polo's account and then

551
00:27:17,300 --> 00:27:22,420
 supported by Chinese historians who, for instance, list there were five great halls, which might

552
00:27:22,420 --> 00:27:25,180
 have all been removable, because essentially the Mongols were nomadic.

553
00:27:25,180 --> 00:27:27,940
 This was the fundamental thing about them.

554
00:27:27,940 --> 00:27:31,100
 And so they just wanted new land to graze.

555
00:27:31,100 --> 00:27:34,620
 All their conquering was just about having new grazing land.

556
00:27:34,620 --> 00:27:38,620
 And so, yeah, it took all their buildings down and buggered off the end of every season.

557
00:27:38,620 --> 00:27:41,260
 And they went somewhere where they could graze more easily.

558
00:27:41,260 --> 00:27:42,260
 Is that right?

559
00:27:42,260 --> 00:27:43,260
 Is that what you're saying?

560
00:27:43,260 --> 00:27:44,260
 No.

561
00:27:44,260 --> 00:27:46,500
 This was, this, the buggering off here was just, you know, summer is over, so he went

562
00:27:46,500 --> 00:27:47,900
 back to the winter capital.

563
00:27:47,900 --> 00:27:48,900
 Got it.

564
00:27:48,900 --> 00:27:52,340
 But in all of their conquests and stuff, like one of, so obviously they conquered the biggest

565
00:27:52,340 --> 00:27:57,860
 contiguous land empire ever known to man, and they didn't care about like settling cities

566
00:27:57,860 --> 00:27:59,020
 and founding big cities.

567
00:27:59,020 --> 00:28:02,420
 So they just flattened cities and then would leave them and go home again.

568
00:28:02,420 --> 00:28:05,900
 And I think people think the reason they didn't take over the whole of Europe is because once

569
00:28:05,900 --> 00:28:08,980
 they got to Hungary and Poland, it wasn't such good grazing land.

570
00:28:08,980 --> 00:28:10,260
 So it was kind of pointless.

571
00:28:10,260 --> 00:28:18,900
 So Kublai Khan was the, was he the first non-Chinese emperor of China, as it were?

572
00:28:18,900 --> 00:28:19,900
 Yes.

573
00:28:19,900 --> 00:28:20,900
 Yeah.

574
00:28:20,900 --> 00:28:21,900
 Is it the Yuan dynasty?

575
00:28:21,900 --> 00:28:22,900
 Yeah.

576
00:28:22,900 --> 00:28:23,900
 It's really interesting.

577
00:28:23,900 --> 00:28:28,020
 One of the things that Marco Polo says about him is the introduction in amongst his group

578
00:28:28,020 --> 00:28:30,140
 of paper money.

579
00:28:30,140 --> 00:28:33,260
 So Marco Polo writes about that, brings that back.

580
00:28:33,260 --> 00:28:38,900
 And just a very tiny thing is the Yuan dynasty or Yuan.

581
00:28:38,900 --> 00:28:42,820
 In Chinese, another way of you put a different tone on that means money.

582
00:28:42,820 --> 00:28:48,300
 And I do wonder if there's a connection to those two, because that was such a dominating

583
00:28:48,300 --> 00:28:50,820
 thing for his court.

584
00:28:50,820 --> 00:28:51,820
 Yeah.

585
00:28:51,820 --> 00:28:53,500
 And it was centred, some of it, apparently.

586
00:28:53,500 --> 00:28:55,460
 Some Chinese paper money was centred.

587
00:28:55,460 --> 00:28:56,580
 Think around about this time.

588
00:28:56,580 --> 00:29:00,140
 Well, they were very big on counterfeiting right away, weren't they?

589
00:29:00,140 --> 00:29:02,540
 They tried to stop every possible...

590
00:29:02,540 --> 00:29:03,540
 Yeah.

591
00:29:03,540 --> 00:29:07,860
 But if you went to a bar in Mongolian times, they didn't take a 20-pound note, sniff it,

592
00:29:07,860 --> 00:29:09,460
 and go, "This isn't real, did they?"

593
00:29:09,460 --> 00:29:12,740
 I'm not sure that was a counterfeiting thing.

594
00:29:12,740 --> 00:29:13,740
 Oh, maybe it was.

595
00:29:13,740 --> 00:29:14,740
 I don't know.

596
00:29:14,740 --> 00:29:15,740
 Maybe it was.

597
00:29:15,740 --> 00:29:20,100
 But it was all mulberry bark or it sounds really cool, but actually it was a sheet of

598
00:29:20,100 --> 00:29:23,540
 paper-like substance derived from the bark of mulberry trees.

599
00:29:23,540 --> 00:29:28,380
 And it had to be signed by multiple officials and it had pictures of the old money on it

600
00:29:28,380 --> 00:29:31,900
 as well, which I think might have been a way of explaining what this is to people who weren't

601
00:29:31,900 --> 00:29:36,820
 accustomed to paper-like money, because the old money was just ropes with coins hanging

602
00:29:36,820 --> 00:29:37,820
 off them.

603
00:29:37,820 --> 00:29:41,580
 So it just had a picture of this, "Hey, this is what this was, and now this is what it

604
00:29:41,580 --> 00:29:42,580
 is."

605
00:29:42,580 --> 00:29:43,580
 That's so cool.

606
00:29:43,580 --> 00:29:44,580
 Yeah.

607
00:29:44,580 --> 00:29:47,780
 That's a bit like when you have, you know, when we all got mobile phones and you'd have

608
00:29:47,780 --> 00:29:51,860
 a picture of an old-shaped phone on your mobile phone, so you knew that was what you

609
00:29:51,860 --> 00:29:52,860
 pressed to call someone.

610
00:29:52,860 --> 00:29:53,860
 It's exactly like that.

611
00:29:53,860 --> 00:29:54,860
 Yeah.

612
00:29:54,860 --> 00:29:55,860
 That's so cool.

613
00:29:55,860 --> 00:29:56,860
 I love schoolomorphism.

614
00:29:56,860 --> 00:29:57,860
 It's called, isn't it?

615
00:29:57,860 --> 00:29:58,860
 Yeah.

616
00:29:58,860 --> 00:30:00,540
 Or a picture of a floppy disk being the sign to save something.

617
00:30:00,540 --> 00:30:01,540
 Yeah.

618
00:30:01,540 --> 00:30:03,900
 Or a picture of a carrot to sell dildos.

619
00:30:03,900 --> 00:30:04,900
 Yeah.

620
00:30:04,900 --> 00:30:05,900
 Yeah.

621
00:30:05,900 --> 00:30:06,900
 Sure.

622
00:30:06,900 --> 00:30:12,140
 Because he had such a big empire, Kublikan, it meant that people could travel from all

623
00:30:12,140 --> 00:30:15,620
 the way from Europe all the way to the other side of Asia.

624
00:30:15,620 --> 00:30:19,300
 And that's obviously why Marco Polo managed to get across there, because before that,

625
00:30:19,300 --> 00:30:23,060
 it was really difficult to traverse those areas.

626
00:30:23,060 --> 00:30:29,700
 So what's the deal with Marco Polo in that I, the last that I'd read or was told about

627
00:30:29,700 --> 00:30:33,500
 him is that, you know, he might have been a fraud or that these weren't trustworthy.

628
00:30:33,500 --> 00:30:40,100
 But all the places that he described, like we know where Xanadu was, we've found the

629
00:30:40,100 --> 00:30:45,420
 dragon statues, we found he got the perimeter sizes wrong, but they were not too far wrong.

630
00:30:45,420 --> 00:30:47,700
 Well, he was blindfolded a lot of the time, Marco Polo.

631
00:30:47,700 --> 00:30:49,260
 So that's why he wasn't able to...

632
00:30:49,260 --> 00:30:53,660
 There are theories, but they're still pretty unusual that he genuinely didn't get there.

633
00:30:53,660 --> 00:30:57,700
 I find it totally implausible because he wrote about it in so much detail and it was possible

634
00:30:57,700 --> 00:30:58,700
 to access.

635
00:30:58,700 --> 00:31:00,620
 And other people went there as well from the West.

636
00:31:00,620 --> 00:31:02,860
 William Brubrick was another one.

637
00:31:02,860 --> 00:31:05,460
 But people used things like he didn't mention the Great Wall of China.

638
00:31:05,460 --> 00:31:06,460
 Yeah.

639
00:31:06,460 --> 00:31:08,940
 But actually, the Great Wall of China, it wasn't really that great at that time.

640
00:31:08,940 --> 00:31:09,940
 So not really worth mentioning.

641
00:31:09,940 --> 00:31:14,300
 There's people in China who still don't know what the Great Wall of China is, genuinely,

642
00:31:14,300 --> 00:31:17,240
 because they've not been up in space, have they?

643
00:31:17,240 --> 00:31:19,580
 So they've not been able to see it.

644
00:31:19,580 --> 00:31:24,140
 I think the argument is, and I don't subscribe to it either, that he got the stories from

645
00:31:24,140 --> 00:31:28,300
 other people and he wrote them down rather than him actually going and experiencing it.

646
00:31:28,300 --> 00:31:31,300
 That's the argument, I think.

647
00:31:31,300 --> 00:31:35,200
 Another guy who did go and experience the Mongols was this guy called William Brubrick,

648
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:36,740
 who was a bit of a Marco Polo.

649
00:31:36,740 --> 00:31:41,100
 He was a Franciscan, we talked about Franciscans recently, he was a missionary.

650
00:31:41,100 --> 00:31:45,580
 And he revealed to us a serious problem with the Khan dynasties, with the Mongol dynasties,

651
00:31:45,580 --> 00:31:47,020
 which was alcoholism.

652
00:31:47,020 --> 00:31:49,300
 So a lot of them had a real issue with this.

653
00:31:49,300 --> 00:31:54,540
 He talked about this amazing thing called the silvertree of Karakorum in the Mongol capital.

654
00:31:54,540 --> 00:31:56,300
 And it sounds extraordinary.

655
00:31:56,300 --> 00:32:02,260
 So it was a huge tall silvertree in the center, and it had an angel, sort of angel-type fairy

656
00:32:02,260 --> 00:32:07,140
 figure with a trumpet on top of it, and then it had lions all around it, and the lions

657
00:32:07,140 --> 00:32:09,260
 would spout a different drink from their mouths.

658
00:32:09,260 --> 00:32:14,680
 So there were four lions, and the lions produced grape wine, fermented maize milk, rice wine,

659
00:32:14,680 --> 00:32:18,140
 and honey mead, depending on which you fancy.

660
00:32:18,140 --> 00:32:22,220
 And the way it worked, well, the way it was supposed to work was that the angel on top

661
00:32:22,220 --> 00:32:25,340
 of the fountain was an automaton, and he blew some bellows at the bottom.

662
00:32:25,340 --> 00:32:28,020
 It played a trumpet, servants rushed out and filled it.

663
00:32:28,020 --> 00:32:32,420
 But the angel automaton never worked, and so what they had to be was a man inside the

664
00:32:32,420 --> 00:32:37,180
 trunk of the tree at all times with a trumpet, who as soon as the emperor decided he wanted

665
00:32:37,180 --> 00:32:41,140
 a drink, had to blow the trumpet so it looked like the angel was blowing it, and then everyone

666
00:32:41,140 --> 00:32:42,640
 flocked in to refill it.

667
00:32:42,640 --> 00:32:43,640
 But then how amazing is that?

668
00:32:43,640 --> 00:32:48,180
 He'd have a party, and there'd be lion fountains spouting every drink of his choice.

669
00:32:48,180 --> 00:32:49,180
 That's so good.

670
00:32:49,180 --> 00:32:50,180
 Pretty good.

671
00:32:50,180 --> 00:32:51,180
 That's amazing.

672
00:32:51,180 --> 00:32:55,180
 I probably would have replaced the maize milk with, like, maybe sangria.

673
00:32:55,180 --> 00:32:56,260
 But that's just me.

674
00:32:56,260 --> 00:32:57,260
 That's what I like.

675
00:32:57,260 --> 00:32:58,260
 Yeah.

676
00:32:58,260 --> 00:33:00,180
 Maybe the later dynasties went there.

677
00:33:00,180 --> 00:33:03,780
 It's like those magical machines that you get in Nandos, which have five different kinds

678
00:33:03,780 --> 00:33:06,380
 of soft drink in them, basically.

679
00:33:06,380 --> 00:33:08,980
 It's cut based on that.

680
00:33:08,980 --> 00:33:14,680
 They actually have a very small man inside them, with a pair of bellows.

681
00:33:14,680 --> 00:33:17,780
 I do actually have another Nandos-related Kublai Khan fact.

682
00:33:17,780 --> 00:33:18,780
 Do you mean another?

683
00:33:18,780 --> 00:33:21,180
 That last one wasn't related to Nandos.

684
00:33:21,180 --> 00:33:24,180
 You just shoe-horned it in.

685
00:33:24,180 --> 00:33:26,180
 It's so true.

686
00:33:26,180 --> 00:33:30,140
 Whenever he had his raw horse meat, he used to put a little flag in it, didn't he?

687
00:33:30,140 --> 00:33:34,580
 He'd say, "How spicy you want to be?"

688
00:33:34,580 --> 00:33:40,300
 Well, if you thought that lick was tenuous James, you'd wait till you hear this one.

689
00:33:40,300 --> 00:33:44,820
 One of Andy's famous sugois, or whatever it was you were calling them, sugoi.

690
00:33:44,820 --> 00:33:50,860
 I think that Kublai Khan basically invented the Nandos black card, which is a card where

691
00:33:50,860 --> 00:33:53,860
 you get free Nandos forever if you have this, right?

692
00:33:53,860 --> 00:33:54,860
 Yeah.

693
00:33:54,860 --> 00:33:55,860
 That's what the Nandos black card is.

694
00:33:55,860 --> 00:34:00,060
 Kublai Khan had a bit of a correspondence with the then Pope.

695
00:34:00,060 --> 00:34:05,020
 Obviously, this is incredibly difficult to do because you're thousands of miles away

696
00:34:05,020 --> 00:34:06,900
 and transporting letters to the nightmare.

697
00:34:06,900 --> 00:34:13,660
 But he sent Khan, this is, sent an ambassador with a paisa, which is a golden tablet, which

698
00:34:13,660 --> 00:34:16,860
 is three inches wide and one foot long.

699
00:34:16,860 --> 00:34:23,020
 What the paisa does is, it authorizes the holder to free food and lodging anywhere throughout

700
00:34:23,020 --> 00:34:24,260
 Kublai Khan's dominion.

701
00:34:24,260 --> 00:34:28,460
 So, it's effectively a Nandos black card for a whole country.

702
00:34:28,460 --> 00:34:29,460
 Yes.

703
00:34:29,460 --> 00:34:30,900
 No, I'm going to give you that.

704
00:34:30,900 --> 00:34:31,900
 Andy.

705
00:34:31,900 --> 00:34:32,900
 Yeah.

706
00:34:32,900 --> 00:34:34,780
 Marco Polo had one of those as well.

707
00:34:34,780 --> 00:34:35,780
 Did he?

708
00:34:35,780 --> 00:34:36,780
 Yeah.

709
00:34:36,780 --> 00:34:42,100
 Marco Polo, when he left to come back to Italy, he was given one of these golden tablets and

710
00:34:42,100 --> 00:34:47,380
 it worked brilliantly until he reached the stronghold of his influence and it got weaker

711
00:34:47,380 --> 00:34:48,380
 and weaker.

712
00:34:48,380 --> 00:34:52,300
 At that point, the gold tablet meant nothing and they started getting beat up and they started

713
00:34:52,300 --> 00:34:53,300
 losing the clothes.

714
00:34:53,300 --> 00:34:58,020
 That's what led to basically him arriving back as a Ruffian, supposedly, and being jailed.

715
00:34:58,020 --> 00:34:59,020
 Really?

716
00:34:59,020 --> 00:35:00,020
 Yeah.

717
00:35:00,020 --> 00:35:03,380
 It's like when he tried to pay with Scottish money for something at the corner.

718
00:35:03,380 --> 00:35:07,300
 I'm like, no, this is legit, I promise you.

719
00:35:07,300 --> 00:35:11,460
 So the person who made it for the whole dynasty was Genghis, right?

720
00:35:11,460 --> 00:35:15,620
 And he started off really poverty-stricken, so he started off being a hunter-gatherer

721
00:35:15,620 --> 00:35:19,900
 because he was basically exiled, but he was born, this is this weird thing, he was born

722
00:35:19,900 --> 00:35:25,100
 with a clot of blood in his hand, apparently, which meant that you were going to be a great

723
00:35:25,100 --> 00:35:26,100
 ruler.

724
00:35:26,100 --> 00:35:29,940
 I mean, obviously he wasn't, if we don't believe in the mythology of these times, but if you're

725
00:35:29,940 --> 00:35:34,740
 a Mongol, a clot of blood in his hand and it was a sign that he was going to be ruthless

726
00:35:34,740 --> 00:35:35,740
 and he was.

727
00:35:35,740 --> 00:35:40,940
 So once he massacred, as well as massacring an entire city, he massacred all the pets,

728
00:35:40,940 --> 00:35:44,820
 all the cats and dogs and cows and camels in the city as well.

729
00:35:44,820 --> 00:35:47,380
 What an awful person.

730
00:35:47,380 --> 00:35:50,340
 He was a bad guy, but he really liked loyalty.

731
00:35:50,340 --> 00:35:51,540
 He was a good guy to his mates.

732
00:35:51,540 --> 00:35:55,900
 He was one of those, if you're friends with him, he's really good to you.

733
00:35:55,900 --> 00:35:59,780
 He was in one battle and someone almost killed him, shooting his horse out from underneath

734
00:35:59,780 --> 00:36:00,780
 him.

735
00:36:00,780 --> 00:36:03,780
 And he sort of stopped the battle, took a bunch of them prisoner and was like, who was

736
00:36:03,780 --> 00:36:06,300
 it who almost shot that horse out from under me?

737
00:36:06,300 --> 00:36:09,660
 And the guy put his hand up for some reason and Genghis said, okay, you, that was a great

738
00:36:09,660 --> 00:36:11,460
 shot, come on my side.

739
00:36:11,460 --> 00:36:14,940
 And this guy ended up being one of his most important generals, helped him conquer the

740
00:36:14,940 --> 00:36:15,940
 world.

741
00:36:15,940 --> 00:36:16,940
 Wow.

742
00:36:16,940 --> 00:36:17,940
 Genghis, good sign.

743
00:36:17,940 --> 00:36:22,780
 When he went through the Middle East trying to siege all these cities, the reason that

744
00:36:22,780 --> 00:36:28,300
 they were so good is they had these massive catapults and their catapults were amazing.

745
00:36:28,300 --> 00:36:32,180
 And they would fire the stones at the city walls and then eventually they would have

746
00:36:32,180 --> 00:36:33,700
 to give up.

747
00:36:33,700 --> 00:36:38,860
 And they were so important that if, you know how they killed all the dogs and cats and stuff

748
00:36:38,860 --> 00:36:39,860
 like that.

749
00:36:39,860 --> 00:36:42,700
 Well, they wouldn't kill the engineers of the city.

750
00:36:42,700 --> 00:36:46,900
 They give them a chance to kind of come over to the Mongol side because they knew how important

751
00:36:46,900 --> 00:36:48,300
 the engineers were.

752
00:36:48,300 --> 00:36:52,360
 And if they agreed, then they would come over and they become part of the Mongol army.

753
00:36:52,360 --> 00:36:57,900
 And there was one city in China somewhere, I can't remember what it's called.

754
00:36:57,900 --> 00:37:01,220
 And they heard about this, that this was happening and they heard the Mongols were coming and

755
00:37:01,220 --> 00:37:04,460
 they decided to get rid of all the stones from the area.

756
00:37:04,460 --> 00:37:09,740
 So for a couple of days, they literally within about a mile circle, they grabbed every single

757
00:37:09,740 --> 00:37:12,980
 stone they could find and brought it into the city.

758
00:37:12,980 --> 00:37:16,660
 But then what the Mongols did instead was they got some mulberry trees, chopped them

759
00:37:16,660 --> 00:37:20,720
 down, put them in water, left them out to dry and they became rock hard and they could

760
00:37:20,720 --> 00:37:24,620
 use those instead of stones to fire in the city.

761
00:37:24,620 --> 00:37:29,500
 Now there's some argument that they weren't good enough and in the end they had to bring

762
00:37:29,500 --> 00:37:33,380
 in some stones from somewhere else because they had like a, like a postal service for

763
00:37:33,380 --> 00:37:39,260
 stones that they used sometimes where they kept like storage of stones, like an Amazon

764
00:37:39,260 --> 00:37:43,900
 storage site of parcels, but they would keep stones in all these different places.

765
00:37:43,900 --> 00:37:44,900
 Really?

766
00:37:44,900 --> 00:37:48,340
 Yeah, they would be like one day's ride away and they bring the stones to each place.

767
00:37:48,340 --> 00:37:50,940
 So there's an argument that they might have done that or it might have been these mulberry

768
00:37:50,940 --> 00:37:51,940
 trees.

769
00:37:51,940 --> 00:37:52,940
 We don't know.

770
00:37:52,940 --> 00:37:53,940
 That's so funny.

771
00:37:53,940 --> 00:37:54,940
 That's so expensive.

772
00:37:54,940 --> 00:37:57,540
 If you're shipping stones internationally, it's hard enough to ship a hardback book,

773
00:37:57,540 --> 00:38:00,220
 but imagine like a hundred bricks or something.

774
00:38:00,220 --> 00:38:04,860
 And you're asking for next day delivery on a lot of these stones.

775
00:38:04,860 --> 00:38:09,900
 Presumably though, you could catapult it to the area you want to get it.

776
00:38:09,900 --> 00:38:11,620
 That's such a good idea.

777
00:38:11,620 --> 00:38:14,020
 Just catapult on to the next catapult.

778
00:38:14,020 --> 00:38:16,100
 I don't think they even thought of that, Doug.

779
00:38:16,100 --> 00:38:18,700
 Only even in charge.

780
00:38:18,700 --> 00:38:23,420
 They used to also tie trees to their horses if they didn't need the trees to be replacement

781
00:38:23,420 --> 00:38:24,420
 rocks.

782
00:38:24,420 --> 00:38:28,100
 So they had all these clever tactics for scaring the enemy and one of them was tying trees

783
00:38:28,100 --> 00:38:29,460
 to the horses that didn't have riders.

784
00:38:29,460 --> 00:38:31,940
 So it sounded like they had a much bigger army than they did.

785
00:38:31,940 --> 00:38:32,940
 Sorry.

786
00:38:32,940 --> 00:38:33,940
 The horses would sound much heavier.

787
00:38:33,940 --> 00:38:34,940
 They were just hanging along a tree.

788
00:38:34,940 --> 00:38:35,940
 Okay.

789
00:38:35,940 --> 00:38:36,940
 Sorry.

790
00:38:36,940 --> 00:38:41,940
 Tying trees to the horses makes it just sound like you're tying your horse to a tree.

791
00:38:41,940 --> 00:38:42,940
 Sorry.

792
00:38:42,940 --> 00:38:43,940
 But you're getting it wrong.

793
00:38:43,940 --> 00:38:46,360
 There's a very big difference between tying your tree to a horse and trying to get a horse

794
00:38:46,360 --> 00:38:47,360
 to a tree.

795
00:38:47,360 --> 00:38:48,860
 It's a completely different thing.

796
00:38:48,860 --> 00:38:54,860
 Imagine being the one guy who's just standing there going, "I don't understand this tactic.

797
00:38:54,860 --> 00:38:58,660
 Where's everyone gone?"

798
00:38:58,660 --> 00:39:00,300
 Oh, no.

799
00:39:00,300 --> 00:39:01,300
 Oh, embarrassing.

800
00:39:01,300 --> 00:39:02,300
 Yeah.

801
00:39:02,300 --> 00:39:03,300
 Sorry.

802
00:39:03,300 --> 00:39:05,020
 Tying trees and branches.

803
00:39:05,020 --> 00:39:09,180
 And they did things like they banged metal pots together and they ruffled bells when

804
00:39:09,180 --> 00:39:14,820
 they galloped into battle so that the opposing army couldn't hear each other shout instructions.

805
00:39:14,820 --> 00:39:15,820
 They wanted it into battle.

806
00:39:15,820 --> 00:39:19,380
 When they were going into battle, they would bang metal pots and pans together and they'd

807
00:39:19,380 --> 00:39:20,940
 rung lots of bells and stuff.

808
00:39:20,940 --> 00:39:24,700
 And that meant that the opposition couldn't hear each other shout out.

809
00:39:24,700 --> 00:39:25,900
 That's really interesting.

810
00:39:25,900 --> 00:39:29,020
 You won't be able to hear yourself think.

811
00:39:29,020 --> 00:39:32,980
 But that's what happens in American football.

812
00:39:32,980 --> 00:39:36,460
 When the other team's on offense and they need to make all their signals, you get your

813
00:39:36,460 --> 00:39:40,340
 fans to make as much noise as possible so that they can't get the signals across.

814
00:39:40,340 --> 00:39:41,340
 Oh, wow.

815
00:39:41,340 --> 00:39:42,340
 And it means that they can't do it.

816
00:39:42,340 --> 00:39:44,180
 So that is a really common thing in American football.

817
00:39:44,180 --> 00:39:45,180
 Wow.

818
00:39:45,180 --> 00:39:48,180
 And then you slaughter the entire opponent, didn't you?

819
00:39:48,180 --> 00:39:49,180
 Yes.

820
00:39:49,180 --> 00:39:50,180
 Hang on.

821
00:39:50,180 --> 00:39:54,940
 Just to go back to this tying your tree to a horse thing, doesn't that...

822
00:39:54,940 --> 00:39:58,940
 And so the idea is the enemy thinks you've got a much bigger army because it sounds bigger.

823
00:39:58,940 --> 00:40:00,820
 This rumbler's bigger, isn't it?

824
00:40:00,820 --> 00:40:01,820
 Well, the rumbler's bigger.

825
00:40:01,820 --> 00:40:07,180
 But this only works in a place where the enemy can hear you but not see you, for one thing.

826
00:40:07,180 --> 00:40:08,180
 Well, no.

827
00:40:08,180 --> 00:40:12,100
 If you're running with an army, presumably a lot of this is going to be on dirt, there's

828
00:40:12,100 --> 00:40:15,540
 going to be a lot of dust raising, you're going to create...

829
00:40:15,540 --> 00:40:16,860
 It's all theatrics.

830
00:40:16,860 --> 00:40:18,900
 That's thought it through.

831
00:40:18,900 --> 00:40:19,900
 You really should have been in charge.

832
00:40:19,900 --> 00:40:20,900
 You're so right.

833
00:40:20,900 --> 00:40:23,220
 The Mongolian desert, there's sand everywhere.

834
00:40:23,220 --> 00:40:24,220
 You can't see a thing.

835
00:40:24,220 --> 00:40:27,780
 But the reason Dad didn't go there is because of the death worms they have in Mongolia.

836
00:40:27,780 --> 00:40:32,700
 They're killed by lightning bolts from the Anus.

837
00:40:32,700 --> 00:40:34,540
 No, thank you.

838
00:40:34,540 --> 00:40:41,260
 This Kubla Khan, Samuel Taylor Coleridge, sort of immortalized Xanadu in that great poem

839
00:40:41,260 --> 00:40:42,260
 of his.

840
00:40:42,260 --> 00:40:45,220
 And this is such a basic thing that I didn't know.

841
00:40:45,220 --> 00:40:49,340
 So I'm saying it for the other people out there who did not know this, even though 90%

842
00:40:49,340 --> 00:40:50,700
 of you will.

843
00:40:50,700 --> 00:40:55,380
 He never finished the poem because someone knocked at his door, a person from Porlock,

844
00:40:55,380 --> 00:40:58,700
 and he lost his creative thread and didn't know how to finish it.

845
00:40:58,700 --> 00:41:02,500
 And I didn't realize that that's become a term that you use for when creativity is

846
00:41:02,500 --> 00:41:07,140
 disrupted, when your inspiration suddenly goes because of some exterior thing.

847
00:41:07,140 --> 00:41:12,140
 A person from Porlock has come is the term to say, I've lost my thread of creativity.

848
00:41:12,140 --> 00:41:16,060
 I think it's fair, Dan, that that is not an extremely common phrase that people use

849
00:41:16,060 --> 00:41:17,060
 all the time.

850
00:41:17,060 --> 00:41:18,060
 Oh, really?

851
00:41:18,060 --> 00:41:19,060
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

852
00:41:19,060 --> 00:41:21,660
 I wouldn't say 90% of the people listening to this.

853
00:41:21,660 --> 00:41:25,540
 If you're listening to this, you're not in a 10% of people who didn't know this.

854
00:41:25,540 --> 00:41:27,780
 Because you just say, it's not that common.

855
00:41:27,780 --> 00:41:30,860
 Well, it's a way to make all of our listeners feel very stupid.

856
00:41:30,860 --> 00:41:35,740
 Well, I was in the category, but then that's even more insulting, I guess.

857
00:41:35,740 --> 00:41:36,740
 Yeah.

858
00:41:36,740 --> 00:41:39,020
 So, so he wrote it in this opium haze.

859
00:41:39,020 --> 00:41:45,340
 He was inspired after reading about the description of Xanadu in Marco Polo's accounts.

860
00:41:45,340 --> 00:41:47,880
 And it never got, now I haven't actually read it myself.

861
00:41:47,880 --> 00:41:49,620
 So does it just cut off?

862
00:41:49,620 --> 00:41:50,620
 Or?

863
00:41:50,620 --> 00:41:51,620
 Yeah.

864
00:41:51,620 --> 00:41:53,980
 It just writes about a person from Poloq at the end of the door.

865
00:41:53,980 --> 00:41:54,980
 It doesn't write into the poem.

866
00:41:54,980 --> 00:41:55,980
 Oh, sorry.

867
00:41:55,980 --> 00:41:56,980
 Who's that at the door?

868
00:41:56,980 --> 00:41:57,980
 Hang on.

869
00:41:57,980 --> 00:41:58,980
 I'll be back in a minute.

870
00:41:58,980 --> 00:41:59,980
 I've got a great idea for the ending.

871
00:41:59,980 --> 00:42:02,420
 And then he comes back and he's like, oh, I've got to rhyme something with ending now.

872
00:42:02,420 --> 00:42:04,420
 What am I going to do?

873
00:42:04,420 --> 00:42:08,100
 No, it does stop halfway through.

874
00:42:08,100 --> 00:42:11,980
 And actually a lot of people think that there was no person from Poloq, and it was just

875
00:42:11,980 --> 00:42:12,980
 an excuse.

876
00:42:12,980 --> 00:42:16,020
 And a lot of people think that it might be just because he was off his face on opium

877
00:42:16,020 --> 00:42:17,940
 that he maybe didn't finish it.

878
00:42:17,940 --> 00:42:25,220
 OK, it is time for our final fact of the show and that is Andy.

879
00:42:25,220 --> 00:42:30,100
 My fact is that according to the people who have drunk it, billion year old water tastes

880
00:42:30,100 --> 00:42:31,100
 terrible.

881
00:42:31,100 --> 00:42:32,100
 I know.

882
00:42:32,100 --> 00:42:33,100
 Shock.

883
00:42:33,100 --> 00:42:34,100
 I know.

884
00:42:34,100 --> 00:42:42,980
 So this doesn't make any sense because I've got some water right here and I've been drinking

885
00:42:42,980 --> 00:42:43,980
 it.

886
00:42:43,980 --> 00:42:46,460
 And this water here, I would say, is more than a billion years old.

887
00:42:46,460 --> 00:42:47,460
 Really?

888
00:42:47,460 --> 00:42:51,020
 This water is like four billion years old or something, twelve billion years old.

889
00:42:51,020 --> 00:42:52,660
 And it tastes fine to me.

890
00:42:52,660 --> 00:42:53,660
 All water, surely.

891
00:42:53,660 --> 00:42:54,900
 Surely it's been cleaned.

892
00:42:54,900 --> 00:42:55,900
 It's been...

893
00:42:55,900 --> 00:42:56,900
 No.

894
00:42:56,900 --> 00:42:57,900
 So you don't make water, do you?

895
00:42:57,900 --> 00:42:58,900
 Like, the earth doesn't make water.

896
00:42:58,900 --> 00:43:02,820
 The water that we have now is the same water as when the dinosaurs were around.

897
00:43:02,820 --> 00:43:07,940
 So I'm receiving a lot of early challenges on this fact and I'll go into it a bit more.

898
00:43:07,940 --> 00:43:13,100
 So you're absolutely right that pretty much all the water on the planet is unbelievably

899
00:43:13,100 --> 00:43:17,420
 old and may well be much older than a billion years.

900
00:43:17,420 --> 00:43:23,900
 This is a body or a pocket of water which was found by a team of Canadian scientists

901
00:43:23,900 --> 00:43:28,180
 led by Barbara Sherwood Lola, who is an earth sciences professor.

902
00:43:28,180 --> 00:43:34,700
 And she and her team found a bit of water about a mile down in Canada, beneath a mine.

903
00:43:34,700 --> 00:43:39,460
 And this pocket has been isolated from the rest of the world for over a billion years.

904
00:43:39,460 --> 00:43:44,260
 So pretty much all of the water on the planet is part of the water cycle where it will cycle

905
00:43:44,260 --> 00:43:45,260
 into the oceans.

906
00:43:45,260 --> 00:43:46,260
 It'll cycle into clouds.

907
00:43:46,260 --> 00:43:48,580
 It'll maybe go into underground aquifers.

908
00:43:48,580 --> 00:43:53,180
 But this stuff that she found and her team has been isolated for up to two and a half

909
00:43:53,180 --> 00:43:54,180
 billion years.

910
00:43:54,180 --> 00:43:57,340
 It's really, really, really, you know, it's been kept separate.

911
00:43:57,340 --> 00:43:59,540
 It's not been in circulation.

912
00:43:59,540 --> 00:44:03,820
 And she was interviewed about it a few years ago and she says she tastes it from time to

913
00:44:03,820 --> 00:44:07,140
 time and it always tastes terrible.

914
00:44:07,140 --> 00:44:10,500
 And she doesn't let her students do it because obviously there isn't a huge amount of this

915
00:44:10,500 --> 00:44:11,500
 stuff to go around.

916
00:44:11,500 --> 00:44:12,500
 And so.

917
00:44:12,500 --> 00:44:14,940
 So this is a common thing, apparently, right?

918
00:44:14,940 --> 00:44:18,100
 Geologists just go around licking and tasting the stuff that they're investigating.

919
00:44:18,100 --> 00:44:22,500
 She was saying to find because apparently you can get an immediate read if you get at that

920
00:44:22,500 --> 00:44:26,140
 kind of thing of the kinds of minerals and stuff or the extent of the minerals.

921
00:44:26,140 --> 00:44:30,140
 And she did say that if you're a geologist who works with rocks, you've licked a lot of

922
00:44:30,140 --> 00:44:31,140
 rocks.

923
00:44:31,140 --> 00:44:32,140
 Yeah.

924
00:44:32,140 --> 00:44:33,140
 Which is quite weird.

925
00:44:33,140 --> 00:44:35,580
 The point is that she's looking for the oldest water in the world.

926
00:44:35,580 --> 00:44:36,980
 That's like what their job is.

927
00:44:36,980 --> 00:44:38,380
 That's what they're looking for.

928
00:44:38,380 --> 00:44:43,300
 And the older it is, the saltier it gets because it means all the bits from the rocks are leached

929
00:44:43,300 --> 00:44:44,300
 into it.

930
00:44:44,300 --> 00:44:47,980
 So as you're going, you're kind of licking little bits of water to get saltier and saltier

931
00:44:47,980 --> 00:44:48,980
 and saltier.

932
00:44:48,980 --> 00:44:51,540
 And the most salty one you get is probably the oldest.

933
00:44:51,540 --> 00:44:52,540
 Right.

934
00:44:52,540 --> 00:44:53,540
 Yeah.

935
00:44:53,540 --> 00:44:54,540
 So that's why she does that.

936
00:44:54,540 --> 00:44:58,220
 If that was her job, she did a bloody good job of it because the previous record holder

937
00:44:58,220 --> 00:45:00,540
 was only tens of millions of years old.

938
00:45:00,540 --> 00:45:05,020
 So she's not only found one that's older, but by almost two and a half billion years.

939
00:45:05,020 --> 00:45:06,740
 It's pretty good going.

940
00:45:06,740 --> 00:45:10,180
 The reason that they realized that this one is so much older than any they found before

941
00:45:10,180 --> 00:45:13,940
 is they've got a new technique of checking how old things are.

942
00:45:13,940 --> 00:45:18,700
 And by using this new technique, which was, I think, discovered by the University of Manchester

943
00:45:18,700 --> 00:45:24,780
 in England, they kind of looked at the isotopes of various gases which are found in this water.

944
00:45:24,780 --> 00:45:29,160
 And by doing that, I won't explain exactly how you do that because it's pretty obvious

945
00:45:29,160 --> 00:45:30,160
 for everyone.

946
00:45:30,160 --> 00:45:34,420
 But basically, you work out how many of certain isotopes of these noble gases are in your

947
00:45:34,420 --> 00:45:39,420
 water, and that will tell you when it kind of landed there in your aquifer.

948
00:45:39,420 --> 00:45:40,420
 Yeah.

949
00:45:40,420 --> 00:45:47,220
 But to go back to Anna's original complaint about this fact, it is bizarre that water is

950
00:45:47,220 --> 00:45:51,420
 - there's a lot of water which is older than the sun.

951
00:45:51,420 --> 00:45:52,420
 Most water is older than the sun.

952
00:45:52,420 --> 00:45:53,420
 Yeah.

953
00:45:53,420 --> 00:45:54,420
 Four billion years old.

954
00:45:54,420 --> 00:45:55,420
 Four and a half billion years old.

955
00:45:55,420 --> 00:45:56,420
 Is that bizarre?

956
00:45:56,420 --> 00:46:00,100
 You don't find it bizarre that the water on the planet is older than the rock?

957
00:46:00,100 --> 00:46:01,100
 Well, I know.

958
00:46:01,100 --> 00:46:02,100
 I find it bizarre.

959
00:46:02,100 --> 00:46:03,620
 But I know that we have a lot of alien water.

960
00:46:03,620 --> 00:46:04,620
 So it's...

961
00:46:04,620 --> 00:46:05,620
 Yeah.

962
00:46:05,620 --> 00:46:08,660
 That's the thing I'm saying is bizarre that there's a lot of alien water which predates

963
00:46:08,660 --> 00:46:09,660
 the planet forming.

964
00:46:09,660 --> 00:46:10,660
 Yeah.

965
00:46:10,660 --> 00:46:11,660
 I think that's mad.

966
00:46:11,660 --> 00:46:12,660
 It is mad.

967
00:46:12,660 --> 00:46:13,660
 He's right.

968
00:46:13,660 --> 00:46:18,540
 So most of the water that we have on earth, we think, actually it's interesting because

969
00:46:18,540 --> 00:46:23,860
 no one really knows where all the water comes from, but we think most of it comes from asteroids

970
00:46:23,860 --> 00:46:27,900
 because you can look at the chemical compositions of your water and notice that it's quite similar

971
00:46:27,900 --> 00:46:29,740
 to what you find in asteroids.

972
00:46:29,740 --> 00:46:34,420
 But some of it has come from the actual formation of the sun itself.

973
00:46:34,420 --> 00:46:39,540
 So when the sun forms, all these bits come together to make this massive body in space,

974
00:46:39,540 --> 00:46:43,940
 but some of it becomes what's called the solar nebula, which is like a gaseous part of the

975
00:46:43,940 --> 00:46:46,060
 sun which doesn't become the sun itself.

976
00:46:46,060 --> 00:46:50,860
 And apparently a lot of that stuff has come down to earth and become some of the water.

977
00:46:50,860 --> 00:46:52,260
 So it didn't all come from asteroids.

978
00:46:52,260 --> 00:46:54,820
 Some of it came from the formation of the sun.

979
00:46:54,820 --> 00:47:01,260
 And apparently for every 100 molecules of water, one or two come from the solar nebula.

980
00:47:01,260 --> 00:47:06,300
 So Anna's big jug of water that she's drinking from at the moment will have millions and

981
00:47:06,300 --> 00:47:10,300
 millions, well, way more than millions of molecules that came from the formation of

982
00:47:10,300 --> 00:47:11,300
 the sun.

983
00:47:11,300 --> 00:47:14,140
 But most of it will have probably come from asteroids.

984
00:47:14,140 --> 00:47:19,580
 And that could be why water evaporates if you believe in a fringe theory because the

985
00:47:19,580 --> 00:47:25,900
 sun causes water to evaporate because it wants its water back, so it's trying to suck it

986
00:47:25,900 --> 00:47:26,900
 back up.

987
00:47:26,900 --> 00:47:27,900
 I mean, yeah.

988
00:47:27,900 --> 00:47:29,700
 It's just a new theory.

989
00:47:29,700 --> 00:47:30,940
 But why it would put itself out?

990
00:47:30,940 --> 00:47:33,300
 It sounds like a brand new theory, Anna.

991
00:47:33,300 --> 00:47:37,860
 Oh my God, there is so much going wrong in these last few things that people have said.

992
00:47:37,860 --> 00:47:39,460
 We should move on.

993
00:47:39,460 --> 00:47:41,660
 Just leave that as accepted facts.

994
00:47:41,660 --> 00:47:42,940
 Move on.

995
00:47:42,940 --> 00:47:48,580
 Just to go into slightly more kind of human timescales of water, do you know why water

996
00:47:48,580 --> 00:47:51,780
 tastes weird when you've left it overnight?

997
00:47:51,780 --> 00:47:56,140
 It's gone funky because flies have gone in there and...

998
00:47:56,140 --> 00:47:57,140
 Yeah.

999
00:47:57,140 --> 00:48:00,100
 James' glasses of water are always full of flies floating.

1000
00:48:00,100 --> 00:48:01,620
 No, they've flown off again.

1001
00:48:01,620 --> 00:48:05,420
 They kind of go in for a little bath in the evening when I'm not around.

1002
00:48:05,420 --> 00:48:07,740
 James, you have to sort out your fly situation.

1003
00:48:07,740 --> 00:48:09,780
 No, that's not it.

1004
00:48:09,780 --> 00:48:15,380
 It's that carbon dioxide from the air has dissolved in the water and it's formed carbonic

1005
00:48:15,380 --> 00:48:16,380
 acid.

1006
00:48:16,380 --> 00:48:19,900
 So basically, according to one article I read about it, you're basically drinking very,

1007
00:48:19,900 --> 00:48:22,740
 very mild acid rain the next morning.

1008
00:48:22,740 --> 00:48:23,740
 Wow.

1009
00:48:23,740 --> 00:48:24,740
 It was really interesting.

1010
00:48:24,740 --> 00:48:30,500
 This is a bit of a personal story, but I'm in Sussex at the moment and had visitors come

1011
00:48:30,500 --> 00:48:35,260
 recently from Oxfordshire when it was after the time when you were allowed to have visitors.

1012
00:48:35,260 --> 00:48:38,540
 And they came from Oxfordshire and one of them had a bottle of water they brought from Oxford

1013
00:48:38,540 --> 00:48:43,260
 and we tasted it and then they tasted the water here and said, "Oh, Sussex water is so delicious,

1014
00:48:43,260 --> 00:48:44,260
 isn't it?

1015
00:48:44,260 --> 00:48:45,260
 So much nicer."

1016
00:48:45,260 --> 00:48:49,140
 So we were talking about and we all could tell immediately by just the smell of the

1017
00:48:49,140 --> 00:48:51,940
 water, we did blind taste testing, which came from where?

1018
00:48:51,940 --> 00:48:56,940
 You can 100% tell the difference from certain places, like from the difference between Bolton

1019
00:48:56,940 --> 00:49:02,980
 and London is it might as well be a different liquid, it just tastes nothing like it.

1020
00:49:02,980 --> 00:49:06,100
 It's Bolton, sometimes it's because of the rocks, this is because of the chemicals that

1021
00:49:06,100 --> 00:49:08,780
 are added in Oxfordshire, which is more chemicals.

1022
00:49:08,780 --> 00:49:12,660
 With us is because we have soft water in Bolton, but we have hard water in London, which is

1023
00:49:12,660 --> 00:49:16,500
 just like, it might as well be orange juice and lemon juice, it's completely different.

1024
00:49:16,500 --> 00:49:20,420
 I wonder if there's anyone who can tell every single county by the taste of the water.

1025
00:49:20,420 --> 00:49:27,220
 Well, in 2016 they did a taste test of all the different waters in the UK with a group

1026
00:49:27,220 --> 00:49:31,220
 of judges that included Michelin star chef Tom Aitkins.

1027
00:49:31,220 --> 00:49:35,680
 So these were experts on water and they tasted them all and they said that the best tasting

1028
00:49:35,680 --> 00:49:42,500
 tap water was the West Midlands, it was found in the West Midlands and the worst was served

1029
00:49:42,500 --> 00:49:45,940
 by Wessex water, which included bath and Bristol.

1030
00:49:45,940 --> 00:49:53,340
 But that was because the water was polluted by a statue of a slave trader, but now apparently

1031
00:49:53,340 --> 00:49:58,060
 according to, but then you see these every kind of few, every couple of years they come

1032
00:49:58,060 --> 00:50:01,580
 up with a new survey and someone else is the best and someone else is the worst.

1033
00:50:01,580 --> 00:50:02,580
 Yeah.

1034
00:50:02,580 --> 00:50:07,060
 But that's very embarrassing bath, trading on its water presentries.

1035
00:50:07,060 --> 00:50:11,260
 I suppose they're quite sulfurous are they in bath, is that the whole point of the bath?

1036
00:50:11,260 --> 00:50:15,620
 The actual springs are, yeah, that you can buy you to cost 50p for a glass of the actual

1037
00:50:15,620 --> 00:50:19,420
 springs water and it's so eggy, it's really gross.

1038
00:50:19,420 --> 00:50:21,580
 People used to order it by delivery though.

1039
00:50:21,580 --> 00:50:26,220
 So back when bath became a thing, it became, there was the resurgence of bath.

1040
00:50:26,220 --> 00:50:30,620
 So bath was a big deal in Roman times because of the spa and then the 18th and 19th centuries,

1041
00:50:30,620 --> 00:50:34,620
 people like Jane Austen in coast, I had holidaying there to take the waters, which were thought

1042
00:50:34,620 --> 00:50:39,460
 to be very curative and you'd visit to cure your sickness and sometimes it worked because

1043
00:50:39,460 --> 00:50:43,620
 water was very polluted let's say in London, but you visit to cure your sickness, but sometimes

1044
00:50:43,620 --> 00:50:48,180
 people didn't have weeks to spare to go holidaying in bath and that's where the bottled water

1045
00:50:48,180 --> 00:50:49,540
 industry started.

1046
00:50:49,540 --> 00:50:54,180
 So they'd write to bath and say, oh, can I just have water delivered and you'd get subscriptions

1047
00:50:54,180 --> 00:50:56,780
 of spa water delivered to you once a month.

1048
00:50:56,780 --> 00:50:57,780
 Wow.

1049
00:50:57,780 --> 00:50:58,780
 That's amazing.

1050
00:50:58,780 --> 00:51:04,460
 So they also invented the subscription meal service, did they?

1051
00:51:04,460 --> 00:51:11,020
 They did. Podcasts in the 19th century would advertise.

1052
00:51:11,020 --> 00:51:15,580
 Do you know, we talk about the oldest water, the oldest rock, the oldest earth rock.

1053
00:51:15,580 --> 00:51:16,940
 Do you know where they found that?

1054
00:51:16,940 --> 00:51:18,940
 Is it in space?

1055
00:51:18,940 --> 00:51:19,940
 Yes.

1056
00:51:19,940 --> 00:51:20,940
 On the moon?

1057
00:51:20,940 --> 00:51:21,940
 On the moon.

1058
00:51:21,940 --> 00:51:22,940
 Yeah.

1059
00:51:22,940 --> 00:51:27,260
 The oldest rock that they think belongs to the earth and that was formed on the earth

1060
00:51:27,260 --> 00:51:32,420
 was found on the moon by the Apollo 14 crew in 1971.

1061
00:51:32,420 --> 00:51:36,460
 They brought down the load of samples and this particular one has got all the right isotopes

1062
00:51:36,460 --> 00:51:38,900
 or whatever to think that it did come from the earth.

1063
00:51:38,900 --> 00:51:39,900
 Wow.

1064
00:51:39,900 --> 00:51:43,380
 And they reckoned that what happened was an asteroid hit the earth really, really early

1065
00:51:43,380 --> 00:51:49,460
 on in its development and it flew a load of stuff into space and then this kind of went

1066
00:51:49,460 --> 00:51:52,940
 around, went around, went around and eventually landed on the moon when the moon formed.

1067
00:51:52,940 --> 00:51:57,540
 The moon was a lot closer to the earth in those days and then was found by these astronauts

1068
00:51:57,540 --> 00:51:58,700
 in 1971.

1069
00:51:58,700 --> 00:52:00,340
 You would be furious if you were NASA.

1070
00:52:00,340 --> 00:52:03,060
 If you were NASA and you said, "Right, guys, can you bring back some moon rocks?"

1071
00:52:03,060 --> 00:52:06,060
 You don't mind like literally any bloody rock you could find.

1072
00:52:06,060 --> 00:52:08,660
 It's all moon rock, isn't it?

1073
00:52:08,660 --> 00:52:11,060
 Thank God the Apollo 11 astronauts didn't bring it back.

1074
00:52:11,060 --> 00:52:20,540
 That would not have helped the conspiracy theories.

1075
00:52:20,540 --> 00:52:21,780
 Okay, that's it.

1076
00:52:21,780 --> 00:52:22,780
 That is all of our facts.

1077
00:52:22,780 --> 00:52:24,220

1088
00:52:45,380 --> 00:52:50,100
 We have everything up there from previous episodes to links to our merchandise.

1089

 for continuing to listen to us in this bizarre, bizarre time.

1091
00:52:57,580 --> 00:53:01,900
 We will be back again next week with another one of these great episodes of Facts.

1092
00:53:01,900 --> 00:53:03,140
 And we'll see you then.

1093
00:53:03,140 --> 00:53:04,140
 Goodbye.

1094
00:53:04,140 --> 00:53:18,460
 And in no particular order, here we go.

1095
00:53:18,460 --> 00:53:19,460
 Starting with my facts.

1096
00:53:19,460 --> 00:53:21,660
 Did you just forget the words to the intro?

1097
00:53:21,660 --> 00:53:24,940
 Yeah, I human buffered.

1098
00:53:24,940 --> 00:53:28,220
 It's not the internet.

1099
00:53:28,220 --> 00:53:30,740
 Your brain has been buffering for a long time, hasn't it, Dad?

1100
00:53:30,740 --> 00:53:31,740
 It's really odd.

1101
00:53:31,740 --> 00:53:32,540
 It's a big rainbow wheel.

1102
00:53:32,540 --> 00:53:33,540
 Bye.

1103
00:53:33,540 --> 00:53:34,540
 Bye.

1104
00:53:34,540 --> 00:53:35,540
 Bye.

1105
00:53:35,540 --> 00:53:35,540
 Bye.

1106
00:53:35,540 --> 00:53:36,540
 Bye.

1107
00:53:36,540 --> 00:53:37,540
 Bye.

1108
00:53:37,540 --> 00:53:38,540
 Bye.

1109
00:53:38,540 --> 00:53:39,540
 Bye.

1110
00:53:39,540 --> 00:53:42,120
 (upbeat music)

1111
00:53:42,120 --> 00:53:44,700
 (gentle music)
