00:00:14,00:00:19,"Hello and welcome to another episode of No Such Thing as a Fish, a weekly podcast coming"
00:00:19,00:00:24,to you from four undisclosed locations in the UK.
00:00:24,00:00:28,"My name is Dan Schreiber, I am sitting here with Anna Tejinski, Andrew Hunter Murray and"
00:00:28,00:00:32,James Harkin and once again we have gathered round the microphones with our four favourite
00:00:32,00:00:37,"facts from the last seven days and in no particular order, here we go."
00:00:37,00:00:41,"Starting with fact number one and that is my fact, my fact this week is that the London"
00:00:41,00:00:45,Underground used to have a church interval on Sundays.
00:00:45,00:00:46,Wow.
00:00:46,00:00:51,"Yeah, it respected the church, it would stop services during church times."
00:00:51,00:00:55,Stop services so that you could have a service.
00:00:55,00:00:57,Very nice and we're off.
00:00:57,00:01:05,It's a bumpy start but at least we're moving.
00:01:05,00:01:08,"If you were halfway between stations, would it just stop underground and you're trapped"
00:01:08,00:01:11,there having to worship God from the subterranean?
00:01:11,00:01:13,"That's such a good point, I don't know."
00:01:13,00:01:17,"I did find a thing called the London Underground Church and I thought, oh great, there's going"
00:01:17,00:01:20,"to be a church down there but apparently it was a political movement, it was a sort"
00:01:20,00:01:23,of like underground in the sense that it wasn't allowed to be known.
00:01:23,00:01:27,So it was a couple of hours on a Sunday so people could go to church.
00:01:27,00:01:32,"Yeah, it was 11 a.m. to 1 p.m. roughly and this is a thing that has existed for a very"
00:01:32,00:01:33,long time.
00:01:33,00:01:39,"So the London Underground, very, very old, the first line opened in 1863 just to put"
00:01:39,00:01:44,"in context, nine days before that Abraham Lincoln signed the Emancipation Proclamation"
00:01:44,00:01:45,in America.
00:01:45,00:01:46,Wow.
00:01:46,00:01:49,Just to put it in context of how old this is.
00:01:49,00:01:54,"Interestingly though Dan, I know how old the London Underground is, better than I know"
00:01:54,00:01:58,when the Proclamation was signed so it didn't really help me that much.
00:01:58,00:02:00,I think that was more for American listeners.
00:02:00,00:02:01,Got it.
00:02:01,00:02:02,Yeah.
00:02:02,00:02:03,Got it.
00:02:03,00:02:08,"Yeah and it's, so there was a big thing where you had to respect a lot of the church during"
00:02:08,00:02:12,those times and one of the things was transport also had to do that and that extended to the
00:02:12,00:02:16,London Underground and that extended all the way till 1900 when I think it was the central
00:02:16,00:02:24,"line, was the first line that didn't abide by the church interval and interestingly, famous"
00:02:24,00:02:27,celebrity on the first central line ride.
00:02:27,00:02:29,"Oh, wait, did you know what year it was?"
00:02:29,00:02:30,1900.
00:02:30,00:02:35,"Oh, who was famous in 1900 who we would have heard of today, Gladstone."
00:02:35,00:02:39,"It was, this is again for the American listeners, it was an American visiting."
00:02:39,00:02:40,"Oh, Charlie Chaplin."
00:02:40,00:02:42,Who is British but that's cool.
00:02:42,00:02:43,Yep.
00:02:43,00:02:44,Got it.
00:02:44,00:02:45,Cool.
00:02:45,00:02:46,What about Edison?
00:02:46,00:02:47,"No, not Edison."
00:02:47,00:02:49,"I mean, it's going to be too hard to get."
00:02:49,00:02:50,Henry Ford.
00:02:50,00:02:51,"No, not Henry Ford."
00:02:51,00:02:52,No.
00:02:52,00:02:55,"It's the Graham Bell, who I appreciate was Scottish, British, spent a lot of his career"
00:02:55,00:02:56,in America.
00:02:56,00:03:01,"Alana Sparassette, who is Canadian but a lot of people think she's American."
00:03:01,00:03:05,"She's North America, wasn't she?"
00:03:05,00:03:08,"Is it Freddie Mercury, who was born in Zanzibar?"
00:03:08,00:03:12,"Ah, very nice."
00:03:12,00:03:14,So we need someone who was alive in 1900.
00:03:14,00:03:15,Let's start with that.
00:03:15,00:03:16,"Oh, you're still making his guess."
00:03:16,00:03:17,You're not just going to tell us.
00:03:17,00:03:18,I've been waiting to tell.
00:03:18,00:03:19,There's so many.
00:03:19,00:03:20,A silent movie star.
00:03:20,00:03:21,A silent movie star.
00:03:21,00:03:22,Okay.
00:03:22,00:03:23,It was an author.
00:03:23,00:03:24,Hemingway.
00:03:24,00:03:25,An American author.
00:03:25,00:03:26,Yeah.
00:03:26,00:03:27,"Again, 1900, Anna."
00:03:27,00:03:28,Yeah.
00:03:28,00:03:29,He would have been very young.
00:03:29,00:03:30,He'd have been a top.
00:03:30,00:03:31,He would have been very young.
00:03:31,00:03:32,"Yeah, but."
00:03:32,00:03:33,He got up for free.
00:03:33,00:03:35,They just carried him over the barriers.
00:03:35,00:03:36,It was fine.
00:03:36,00:03:41,Hemingway could have been a little two-year-old on holiday in Britain at the time.
00:03:41,00:03:42,That's true.
00:03:42,00:03:44,"We wouldn't, Dan, put us out."
00:03:44,00:03:45,Mark Twain.
00:03:45,00:03:46,Everybody's misery.
00:03:46,00:03:47,It was Mark Twain.
00:03:47,00:03:48,Yes.
00:03:48,00:03:49,Yes.
00:03:49,00:03:50,Wow.
00:03:50,00:03:52,Do we nobody thought of it?
00:03:52,00:03:56,"I didn't actually, no, I didn't actually find, but we do know what the Daily Mail reported"
00:03:56,00:03:57,about us.
00:03:57,00:04:02,"It said, ""Verocious curiosity, astonished satisfaction and solid merit."
00:04:02,00:04:06,"If this kind of thing goes on, London will come to be quite a nice place to travel in."
00:04:06,00:04:11,"The conductor was all a quiver of joy and pride, but there was no indecorous exhibition"
00:04:11,00:04:13,of emotion.
00:04:13,00:04:15,"Every man was solidly British."""
00:04:15,00:04:20,"These early breaks, though, or these rather, these kind of Sunday trading rules, a lot"
00:04:20,00:04:24,"of it, I think, because there used to be trains every day."
00:04:24,00:04:28,"They used to be Christmas Day Expresses, and then a lot of the trains had to be axed on"
00:04:28,00:04:32,"Sundays partly because of religion, but that was a bit of an excuse, really, because a"
00:04:32,00:04:34,lot of it was down to economics.
00:04:34,00:04:38,"The fact was there was this thing called the Railway Mania, which sounds like an amazing"
00:04:38,00:04:43,"time in Britain's history, where every person in the country was invested in or actively"
00:04:43,00:04:48,building a railway. And they got all the thousands of railways across the country. And most of
00:04:48,00:04:52,them didn't make any money because they didn't have any passengers. And this was an easy thing
00:04:52,00:04:57,to act with Sunday trains. And companies were needing to save money in the 1860s. And these
00:04:57,00:04:59,were lightly used trains. They were an obvious target.
00:04:59,00:05:04,"Yeah. It's a bit like, remember when they opened up directory inquiries and you had"
00:05:04,00:05:11,"all those different 118 numbers, like 118, 118, or 118, 888, or 118, 111, or 118, 222,"
00:05:11,00:05:15,"or whatever. It was like, they opened this thing up for anyone with a little bit of money"
00:05:15,00:05:19,"to think, I can make something big there. And everyone came in and then of course, most"
00:05:19,00:05:20,of them just died out.
00:05:20,00:05:23,But what were the things that you could ring and ask?
00:05:23,00:05:25,"Like, what is Andy's phone number?"
00:05:25,00:05:28,I hope no one would tell you that. I hope the only people who could tell you that would
00:05:28,00:05:31,be me with my phone number and you have no idea already.
00:05:31,00:05:34,"Well, it's interesting you should say that, Andy, because in the olden days, which you"
00:05:34,00:05:38,"won't remember, there used to be phone books that had everyone's phone numbers in them."
00:05:38,00:05:41,I'd be ex-directory. They let you take yourself off though.
00:05:41,00:05:45,"They let you take yourself off. Yeah. And if I rang up and said, what's Andy's phone"
00:05:45,00:05:49,"number? This is back in the day and you take it and you're taking yourself off. They say,"
00:05:49,00:05:50,"oh, he's taken himself off."
00:05:50,00:05:54,"My mum definitely still does 118, or she certainly was a couple of years ago. She would ring"
00:05:54,00:05:57,up for someone's number and you don't want to be ex-directory because they were always
00:05:57,00:06:03,"pricks if you remember. It was always either your parents were a doctor, which for some"
00:06:03,00:06:07,"reason was okay, or you're a bit of a dickhead."
00:06:07,00:06:12,"On Sunday trading and Sunday hours and things like that, the history of Sunday trading in"
00:06:12,00:06:17,"Britain is very funny when you look into it. And did explain to me why still, if I ever"
00:06:17,00:06:21,"go out to buy something on a Sunday, my mum will say, well, I mean, the shops won't be"
00:06:21,00:06:27,"open. What are you doing? Because, so the Sunday shops act happened in 1950, which basically"
00:06:27,00:06:32,said no shops except essentials can open on a Sunday because of church. And it was repealed
00:06:32,00:06:38,"in 1994. But I was reading all these parliamentary debates in the interim, which showed how very"
00:06:38,00:06:42,"controversial it was because the rules were so convoluted. So for instance, you could"
00:06:42,00:06:48,buy essentials. People acknowledged that perishables couldn't wait another day. So you could sell
00:06:48,00:06:49,vegetables.
00:06:49,00:06:52,"So there were all these people, for instance, who would have furniture shops. There was"
00:06:52,00:06:58,"a case in 1972, Walla vs Hardy, where a furniture shop was selling carrots for Â£250 each. But"
00:06:58,00:07:04,you've got a free item of furniture with your carrot as a free gift to get away with it.
00:07:04,00:07:09,There was this bizarre rule where fish and chip shops were specifically banned from selling
00:07:09,00:07:14,fish and chips on a Sunday. But anyone else could sell fish and chips. So a Chinese takeaway
00:07:14,00:07:18,"could sell fish and chips, but a fish and chips shop couldn't. But a fish and chip shop"
00:07:18,00:07:23,could sell a Chinese takeaway on a Sunday. It was wild.
00:07:23,00:07:29,"There was a thing where you're not allowed to buy dog food, but if you said to the guy"
00:07:29,00:07:33,"of the shop, ""I have a pony who only eats dog food,"" you're allowed to buy it because"
00:07:33,00:07:36,you're allowed to buy pony food. And it didn't say...
00:07:36,00:07:39,"Oh, because dogs are very religious, but I think horses aren't, are they?"
00:07:39,00:07:45,"That's right, yeah. That's insane. I found out about a sex shop in Cheshire called the"
00:07:45,00:07:52,"Private Shop. And in 2014, they were applying to be allowed to trade on a Sunday, right?"
00:07:52,00:07:56,"And they were not allowed to do so, but they were granted permission to leave the door"
00:07:56,00:07:58,slightly open. Right.
00:07:58,00:08:04,"But the thing is, I bought a carrot from there for $5.99, and they gave me a free dildo."
00:08:04,00:08:10,"Well, that's two dildos for the price of one. That's great, yeah."
00:08:10,00:08:18,I'm not going round to y'alls for Sunday lunch.
00:08:18,00:08:23,"In 1816 in Massachusetts, there was a guy who was called George Pierce, who was arrested"
00:08:23,00:08:27,"for riding on a Sunday, because in America, you weren't allowed to ride your horse on"
00:08:27,00:08:32,a Sunday. He was arrested as acting against the peace and dignity of the Commonwealth of
00:08:32,00:08:37,"Massachusetts, and he was put in prison, and then he was only let out on a Monday. But then"
00:08:37,00:08:41,"he sued the officer for false arrest because he said, ""Yeah, you're not allowed to do anything"
00:08:41,00:08:49,"on Sundays, including arresting me."" And he won his court case, and he got $500 of damages"
00:08:49,00:08:52,from the police officer for arresting him.
00:08:52,00:08:53,Wow.
00:08:53,00:08:54,Brilliant move.
00:08:54,00:08:55,That's great.
00:08:55,00:08:59,I read a bizarre thing that this is just things that were banned in the UK on Sundays. It was
00:08:59,00:09:06,"in, for about 28 years, roughly, in the 16th century, it was made illegal to not wear a"
00:09:06,00:09:13,"woolen cap on a Sunday. And this was not for all parts of society, but it was predominantly"
00:09:13,00:09:16,for the people who couldn't afford to pay the fight.
00:09:16,00:09:23,"So Queen Elizabeth basically put a law in place where she said that maids, ladies, gentlemen,"
00:09:23,00:09:28,"noble personages, and every Lord, Knight, and gentleman of 20 marks land were exempt"
00:09:28,00:09:33,"from having to wear this hat, but everyone else had to wear a woolen hat on a Sunday"
00:09:33,00:09:38,"in the UK. And if you were caught not wearing it, you would be fined so much that you probably"
00:09:38,00:09:41,couldn't afford it and then would have to do jail time. So there was a huge risk to
00:09:41,00:09:42,it.
00:09:42,00:09:45,"And the reason was to help the woolen industry, right?"
00:09:45,00:09:46,"Yeah, exactly."
00:09:46,00:09:47,Yeah.
00:09:47,00:09:48,What are you in for?
00:09:48,00:09:53,"Well, I think you can see."
00:09:53,00:09:57,That's very hot in summer.
00:09:57,00:09:58,Yeah.
00:09:58,00:09:59,Yes.
00:09:59,00:10:03,Were there regulations about the size of the woolen cap? Could you basically wear a very
00:10:03,00:10:05,small sort of button size woolen cap?
00:10:05,00:10:12,I think it was a very specific design. It was a sort of uniform style bubble hat that
00:10:12,00:10:13,you would have to wear.
00:10:13,00:10:18,Yeah. That's been quite a common way of policing these kind of Sunday laws is to find people
00:10:18,00:10:24,"for not doing it. In 1581, it was the law that you had to go to church every Sunday."
00:10:24,00:10:28,"Everyone in the country had to go to church. And if you decided you didn't want to, you"
00:10:28,00:10:34,had to pay a fine of Â£20 per month. And that was 20 times the average monthly wage. So
00:10:34,00:10:39,it would take you almost two years to earn that fine if you didn't do it.
00:10:39,00:10:42,"Oh, my God, yeah."
00:10:42,00:10:46,"Just while you mentioned church ceremonies, I found out about the longest church service"
00:10:46,00:10:49,because this fact is about church intervals.
00:10:49,00:10:50,Okay.
00:10:50,00:10:51,Have you heard of the Sigwee?
00:10:51,00:10:53,"Sigwee, don't think so."
00:10:53,00:10:55,Are you trying to do a Segway?
00:10:55,00:11:00,"No. I am trying to do a Segway into a fact about the Sigwee, but that is just a coincidence."
00:11:00,00:11:07,This is a mask festival held by the Dogon people of Mali. And it's the last one lasted
00:11:07,00:11:08,for six years.
00:11:08,00:11:09,Come on.
00:11:09,00:11:12,So it's a long service.
00:11:12,00:11:16,I'm not sure you have to spend all your time at it. It's not like a sermon that lasts for
00:11:16,00:11:21,"six years, but you have to carve a great mask and several meters long these masks sometimes."
00:11:21,00:11:26,And then you have to perform what the Guinness Book of Records calls a time-consuming procession
00:11:26,00:11:28,of dances from village to village.
00:11:28,00:11:29,Wow.
00:11:29,00:11:31,"And yeah, they're not doing another one until 2037."
00:11:31,00:11:35,I was wondering if Southern Rail have been on a church interval for the Dogon people
00:11:35,00:11:39,of Mali for the last seven years.
00:11:39,00:11:44,"Okay, it is time for fact number two, and that is James."
00:11:44,00:11:50,"Okay, my fact this week is that the first ice cream on a stick was called the Good Humour"
00:11:50,00:11:51,Bar.
00:11:51,00:11:56,It's a modified version of a lollipop called the Jolly Boy Sucker.
00:11:56,00:11:58,You said that like the Jolly Boy Sucker.
00:11:58,00:12:01,"Well, I would say it was the Jolly Boy Sucker."
00:12:01,00:12:03,There's no punctuation.
00:12:03,00:12:04,So I don't really know.
00:12:04,00:12:07,"I don't know how to say it's in the eye of the beholder, isn't it?"
00:12:07,00:12:14,So this is the weather outside at the moment as we record is absolutely sweltering.
00:12:14,00:12:19,So I thought we could do a fact about ice creams and this is about ice creams on a stick.
00:12:19,00:12:23,"So things like I don't know, magnums or mini milks or whatever you would have."
00:12:23,00:12:27,And they were invented in around 1923.
00:12:27,00:12:32,"So a few years earlier, Harry Burt, who is a guy from Ohio, he'd put a lollipop on a"
00:12:32,00:12:37,stick which he called the Jolly Boy Sucker and his son suggested adding ice cream on
00:12:37,00:12:42,the outside of it and maybe a chocolate covering and it became really popular.
00:12:42,00:12:46,And he called it Good Humour because he thought that your mood was related to your sense of
00:12:46,00:12:47,taste.
00:12:47,00:12:50,"If you tasted something really good, you'd always be in a good mood and if you tasted"
00:12:50,00:12:52,"something bad, you would always be in a bad mood."
00:12:52,00:12:53,Hang on.
00:12:53,00:12:58,"Is that like the medieval theory of the four humans where if you're too choleric, you have"
00:12:58,00:12:59,too much bile?
00:12:59,00:13:03,"I don't think when he called it Good Humour, he thought it has half a bit of cholera, half"
00:13:03,00:13:06,"a bit of bile, half a bit of blood."
00:13:06,00:13:07,I don't think he thought that.
00:13:07,00:13:11,"But actually Good Humour, I didn't know this because I haven't spent much time in America,"
00:13:11,00:13:13,but it's quite a big brand in America.
00:13:13,00:13:14,"It's owned by Unilever, I think."
00:13:14,00:13:19,"Yeah, I don't know it by name, but I recognize the logo as almost a childhood ice cream,"
00:13:19,00:13:20,bizarrely.
00:13:20,00:13:22,"So sorry, was there a lolly?"
00:13:22,00:13:25,"Was it like he kept the lolly inside, did you say?"
00:13:25,00:13:29,So you break the chocolate and then the ice cream and then you chow down on a rock hard
00:13:29,00:13:30,piece of candy.
00:13:30,00:13:31,"Oh, I did."
00:13:31,00:13:32,That's amazing.
00:13:32,00:13:33,"That's good, isn't it?"
00:13:33,00:13:34,Do you remember those?
00:13:34,00:13:35,What were they called?
00:13:35,00:13:37,You used to get ice creams where you had some bubble gum at the bottom.
00:13:37,00:13:38,It's a bit like that.
00:13:38,00:13:39,"Oh, cool."
00:13:39,00:13:42,"You guys are all too young to remember these things, but..."
00:13:42,00:13:45,"Well, Anna's mum will text 118, 118 and find out what it was."
00:13:45,00:13:50,This whole class is going to be me reminiscing about the ice creams of my youth and you guys
00:13:50,00:13:54,"going, ""Oh, we only have carnettos."""
00:13:54,00:13:56,"These Good Humour bars, they were kind of..."
00:13:56,00:14:00,They were seen as very proper and sort of very...
00:14:00,00:14:02,The firm was seen as a very moral one.
00:14:02,00:14:06,"So there was a book about ice cream, which I looked at a bit of, called Sweet Spot."
00:14:06,00:14:10,"And it has this to say about the Good Humour trucks, because he kind of invented the ice"
00:14:10,00:14:12,cream truck in a way as well.
00:14:12,00:14:16,"It said, ""The white shirt and the cap the drivers sported help create a mythology around"
00:14:16,00:14:20,the Good Humour brand of trustworthiness and dependability.
00:14:20,00:14:26,That lasted until the mid-1970s when the Brooklyn District Attorney's Office filed a 244 count
00:14:26,00:14:31,"indictment of Good Humour, charging the company with falsifying records to hide excessive amounts"
00:14:31,00:14:32,"of bacteria."""
00:14:32,00:14:33,What?
00:14:33,00:14:34,Really?
00:14:34,00:14:35,Wow.
00:14:35,00:14:37,"That was a long time ago, though, we should say."
00:14:37,00:14:38,Yes.
00:14:38,00:14:39,Very long time ago.
00:14:39,00:14:44,"The origins of, as you say, like the ice cream truck, and they really cared about the presentation"
00:14:44,00:14:46,of how they were going through the community.
00:14:46,00:14:52,"So anyone who became a Good Humour man, which became quite a culturally significant role,"
00:14:52,00:14:57,"there was movies made using that title, The Good Humour Man, later on, they all had to"
00:14:57,00:15:01,go and do courses to learn how to be the best version of that role.
00:15:01,00:15:05,So there was a two to three day course that you would go on.
00:15:05,00:15:09,They were taught to always tip their hat towards a lady if they came towards them.
00:15:09,00:15:11,"And if they didn't do that, they would be fired."
00:15:11,00:15:13,"And they had to say, ""Ice cream, Good Humour."""
00:15:13,00:15:16,"If they said, ""Good Humour, Ice Cream,"" that was the improper way of saying it."
00:15:16,00:15:18,And that could lead to them being fired as well.
00:15:18,00:15:19,That was quite good.
00:15:19,00:15:20,Yeah.
00:15:20,00:15:23,There was a handbook called Making Good at Good Humour that they all had to study in
00:15:23,00:15:27,order to become this representative of the company.
00:15:27,00:15:31,"Don't forget, Dan, they also had to falsify records to hide excessive amounts of bacteria"
00:15:31,00:15:32,in the product.
00:15:32,00:15:34,Do you know what people's favourite ice lolly is today?
00:15:34,00:15:36,I was quite surprised by this.
00:15:36,00:15:38,Also lolly or ice cream?
00:15:38,00:15:39,Ice cream or lolly on a stick?
00:15:39,00:15:41,Anything cold on a stick?
00:15:41,00:15:42,Cold on a stick.
00:15:42,00:15:43,Magnum.
00:15:43,00:15:44,"Yeah, I understand."
00:15:44,00:15:45,"Oh, you straight away went for Magnum."
00:15:45,00:15:46,Okay.
00:15:46,00:15:47,It's Magnum.
00:15:47,00:15:48,It's bang on Magnum.
00:15:48,00:15:49,What is that rabbit?
00:15:49,00:15:53,"28% of the country think they're the best, and the runner-up is on like 8%."
00:15:53,00:15:56,I think it's because it's not very easy to remember any others.
00:15:56,00:15:57,Yeah.
00:15:57,00:15:58,Do you think?
00:15:58,00:15:59,You're right.
00:15:59,00:16:00,Yeah.
00:16:00,00:16:01,I would go feast.
00:16:01,00:16:02,"Absolutely, yeah."
00:16:02,00:16:03,Feast any day of the week.
00:16:03,00:16:04,"Yeah, feast is great."
00:16:04,00:16:05,But Magnum in...
00:16:05,00:16:06,But it's not a market leader in the way that Magnum is.
00:16:06,00:16:09,"I think saying, ""What's your favourite flavour of cola?"""
00:16:09,00:16:13,You're only going to get people to say Pepsi or Coca-Cola at you.
00:16:13,00:16:14,That's true.
00:16:14,00:16:20,"Well, anyway, it might be so popular because they invented a new kind of chocolate for"
00:16:20,00:16:21,the Magnum.
00:16:21,00:16:22,"Oh, really?"
00:16:22,00:16:24,Which is a really exciting move.
00:16:24,00:16:29,"They've only been around since the very late '80s, I think, and basically the problem"
00:16:29,00:16:34,"was that chocolate cracks at a certain low temperature, so it was actually very hard"
00:16:34,00:16:36,to get good quality chocolate around ice cream.
00:16:36,00:16:41,And they created this new kind of chocolate that didn't break at minus 40 degrees.
00:16:41,00:16:46,"And I read this weird blog by a business analyst, which was saying that Magnum is the epitome"
00:16:46,00:16:49,of good business because of its simplicity.
00:16:49,00:16:54,"And then when they brought along the new flavours like cherry, gavara, John Lemon, woodchock"
00:16:54,00:17:00,"and jammy Hendrix, none of which I knew existed, they described them as the four horsemen"
00:17:00,00:17:01,of the apocalypse.
00:17:01,00:17:02,Wow.
00:17:02,00:17:03,Wow.
00:17:03,00:17:04,I don't think we've ever mentioned this before.
00:17:04,00:17:10,"There is quite a widely known claim that Roger Moore, James Bond, invented the Magnum."
00:17:10,00:17:11,Yes.
00:17:11,00:17:12,Okay.
00:17:12,00:17:16,"And it's because he was being interviewed in the 1960s and he was asked, if you could"
00:17:16,00:17:18,"ask one person any question, what would it be?"
00:17:18,00:17:21,"And he said, ""I would like to meet Mr. Walls of Walls Ice Cream and say, why don't you"
00:17:21,00:17:23,"do a chalk ice with vanilla on a stick?"""
00:17:23,00:17:24,Ah.
00:17:24,00:17:28,"And he also said, ""I didn't realise that other people at the time said they wanted to meet"
00:17:28,00:17:29,"Gandhi or Jesus."""
00:17:29,00:17:31,That was his answer.
00:17:31,00:17:37,"Anyway, Walls sent him a cake which had plain chocolate on the outside and vanilla ice cream"
00:17:37,00:17:38,on the inside.
00:17:38,00:17:42,And this later got parlayed into he invented the concept of the Magnum.
00:17:42,00:17:46,"Anyway, the Magnum was eventually made 23 years later, give or take."
00:17:46,00:17:47,Okay.
00:17:47,00:17:48,"Well, he was ahead of his time."
00:17:48,00:17:49,Yeah.
00:17:49,00:17:55,"A spokeswoman for Unilever told the son who asked them about it, ""Sadly, we've never heard"
00:17:55,00:17:58,"this brilliant story, but we are thrilled to hear the late great Sir Roger Moore was"
00:17:58,00:18:00,"a fan of Magnum."""
00:18:00,00:18:03,"Very carefully saying, ""There's no truth in this measure at all."""
00:18:03,00:18:08,"I believe it, because it often takes a long time between the prototype, like Alexander"
00:18:08,00:18:09,Fleming discovered penicillin.
00:18:09,00:18:14,"It was a long time before he was able to market it, so probably in the same way, that first"
00:18:14,00:18:19,"Magnum cake, you know, there was, of course, there was a gap before they could make it"
00:18:19,00:18:20,possible.
00:18:20,00:18:21,"Well, didn't..."
00:18:21,00:18:22,A Magnum cake sounds great.
00:18:22,00:18:26,Didn't Harry Burt spend three years trying to get his good humour bar patented as well?
00:18:26,00:18:27,Yeah.
00:18:27,00:18:31,"One was granting the patent, and I think he eventually went down to the patent office"
00:18:31,00:18:36,"with the ice cream and gave out samples, and then according to the story of Good Humour's"
00:18:36,00:18:39,"official website, that's when they were granted the patent."
00:18:39,00:18:40,Yeah.
00:18:40,00:18:44,He apparently had a five-gallon bucket of these ice creams and just handed them out to absolutely
00:18:44,00:18:47,everyone who could make a decision.
00:18:47,00:18:51,"We were just talking about walls, which is kind of the UK version of Good Humour, because"
00:18:51,00:18:54,they're both owned by Unilever.
00:18:54,00:18:57,They started around the start of the 19th century.
00:18:57,00:19:03,"In 1812, George the Prince of Wales granted Richard Wall a royal warrant as the purveyor"
00:19:03,00:19:07,"of pork to the king, and that's where they started."
00:19:07,00:19:13,"He was the official royal purveyor of pork, and it was because he had a shop on German"
00:19:13,00:19:18,"Street in London where he could make sausages, and no one really else could make as good"
00:19:18,00:19:23,"sausages as him, because he had this machine, and it was a donkey that would walk around"
00:19:23,00:19:29,"the machine, and it would create a cutting motion that would turn the meat into mincemeat,"
00:19:29,00:19:35,"which he could then turn into sausages, which he could then purve pork-like to the king."
00:19:35,00:19:39,"That's amazing, because these days, a technical edge is having a better factory that makes"
00:19:39,00:19:44,"microprocessors more effectively, and in those days, the commercial edge was just your donkey"
00:19:44,00:19:46,on a street.
00:19:46,00:19:52,"Then in 1913, they came up the idea, because what would happen is, in the summer, no one"
00:19:52,00:19:57,"wanted pork anymore, because it was too hot for pork, and they were like, have to lay"
00:19:57,00:20:02,"people off, and so they came up with the idea of making ice creams, because they had refrigeration,"
00:20:02,00:20:06,"so they came up with the idea of making ice creams to avoid layoffs, and that's when they"
00:20:06,00:20:09,"became this big, probably the biggest ice cream company in the UK."
00:20:09,00:20:15,"I thought you were going to say that they sold frozen pork for people to sell, and that was"
00:20:15,00:20:17,how they part-laid it in.
00:20:17,00:20:24,"The Magnum used to be a flat sausage on a stick, and the thing was, he also sent people"
00:20:24,00:20:28,around in an early ice cream van way.
00:20:28,00:20:33,"They had tricycles with the ice creams in, and they had the slogan, ""Stop me and buy"
00:20:33,00:20:38,"one,"" which still exists today, but he would let them go on a Sunday when most people wouldn't"
00:20:38,00:20:40,let people work on a Sunday.
00:20:40,00:20:44,"He would let his ice cream sellers go on a Sunday, but he said that they would only let"
00:20:44,00:20:49,"them do it if they went to church in the morning, and it was under his supervision, so they"
00:20:49,00:20:52,"had to go to church with him in the morning, and if they did, then they could sell the"
00:20:52,00:20:56,ice creams in the afternoon.
00:20:56,00:21:00,Just a little ice cream news story I found in the process of this.
00:21:00,00:21:04,"In 2018, a man called Mr. Tickle was arrested for threatening an ice cream van owner with"
00:21:04,00:21:09,a samurai sword while high on cocaine.
00:21:09,00:21:13,"That started off so risible with Mr. Tickle, and then it went dark really quickly."
00:21:13,00:21:15,It's actually an awful story.
00:21:15,00:21:16,There were children present.
00:21:16,00:21:17,It was incredibly upsetting for them.
00:21:17,00:21:20,He later went unhid by some bins before being arrested.
00:21:20,00:21:25,"Unfortunately, they saw his really long arms poking out from the bins, didn't they?"
00:21:25,00:21:31,"He put up his hands to the cups, knocked down some aeroplanes."
00:21:31,00:21:35,"Anyway, it's probably too inappropriate, because, yeah, he did threaten the van owner"
00:21:35,00:21:36,with it.
00:21:36,00:21:37,He was called Jamie Tickle.
00:21:37,00:21:38,Okay.
00:21:38,00:21:39,That's all right?
00:21:39,00:21:40,Okay.
00:21:40,00:21:41,No one died?
00:21:41,00:21:45,"No, I just don't want him to come and find me."
00:21:45,00:21:46,It's all right.
00:21:46,00:21:50,He'll get stopped by the long arm of the last.
00:21:50,00:21:54,I've got a 2008 press release that I can tell you about.
00:21:54,00:21:59,"You guys are too young to remember this, but until 1988, all lollipop sticks had jokes"
00:21:59,00:22:00,on them.
00:22:00,00:22:01,"Oh, yeah."
00:22:01,00:22:04,"So whenever you wet your magnum, when you got to the end of it, you could read the little"
00:22:04,00:22:06,joke on the sticks.
00:22:06,00:22:10,They were phased out in 1988 because they thought that people who were eating ice cream
00:22:10,00:22:12,were becoming a bit more sophisticated.
00:22:12,00:22:15,They didn't think that the jokes were appropriate anymore.
00:22:15,00:22:17,"Wait, this is so weird, James."
00:22:17,00:22:20,"I thought I remembered that, but I was not in a position to read lollipop stick jokes"
00:22:20,00:22:21,in 1988.
00:22:21,00:22:26,It's possible your parents had a lot of out-of-date ice creams that they were giving you.
00:22:26,00:22:28,I think that must be it.
00:22:28,00:22:29,"No more parents, that is likely."
00:22:29,00:22:33,"They phased them out in 1988, so I suppose there might have been a few stragglers a bit"
00:22:33,00:22:37,"later, but maybe the kids ones, like Minnie Milks, might have kept them on."
00:22:37,00:22:43,"So in 2008, Walls approached James Corden to start a new career, writing jokes for"
00:22:43,00:22:47,ice cream sticks because they wanted to bring them back.
00:22:47,00:22:51,They said that he would be ideal because James is an up-and-coming comedian who is
00:22:51,00:22:52,cutting edge.
00:22:52,00:22:53,Yeah.
00:22:53,00:22:55,Surely that's a miscareer opportunity for James.
00:22:55,00:22:56,I know.
00:22:56,00:22:57,"We don't know if he said no yet, Hannah."
00:22:57,00:22:58,We don't know if he said no.
00:22:58,00:22:59,You're right.
00:22:59,00:23:02,"Well, I think he did say no."
00:23:02,00:23:03,But where is he now?
00:23:03,00:23:04,Where is he now?
00:23:04,00:23:05,Where is he now?
00:23:05,00:23:06,Yeah.
00:23:06,00:23:11,"So what they phased out in the '80s, which only James will remember, is the double popsicle."
00:23:11,00:23:15,"Actually, I think this was in America, but I didn't know these were such things."
00:23:15,00:23:16,I remember those.
00:23:16,00:23:18,"Like, is it an ice lolly with two sticks?"
00:23:18,00:23:20,It's a lollipop with two sticks.
00:23:20,00:23:21,"Oh, right."
00:23:21,00:23:22,"No, I don't remember that."
00:23:22,00:23:27,These were actually a ploy in the Great Depression to sell more people lollipops.
00:23:27,00:23:29,So it was invented so that they could sell two for the price of one.
00:23:29,00:23:33,"So the idea, a public health nightmare, you'll agree, is that you would share a lollipop,"
00:23:33,00:23:38,"so you'd buy one lolly, but you have two sticks, so two people can share it and they hold it."
00:23:38,00:23:41,You're each holding a stick and eating it.
00:23:41,00:23:42,Your mouths are right next to each other.
00:23:42,00:23:45,"Well, he's like a lady in the tram moment, just a lot longer."
00:23:45,00:23:46,That's a much longer scene.
00:23:46,00:23:47,Yeah.
00:23:47,00:23:48,That was it.
00:23:48,00:23:53,They both lick either side of this lollipop until eventually they both get to this final
00:23:53,00:23:58,"sliver of lolly where they lick the final bit and then eventually, romantically, they're"
00:23:58,00:24:02,licking each other's tongues.
00:24:02,00:24:08,"This is how romance happens in the '20s, I'm telling you, but over the years, I think"
00:24:08,00:24:13,people forgot that it was meant for two people and so it just became a lolly with two sticks
00:24:13,00:24:14,on it.
00:24:14,00:24:15,Sorry.
00:24:15,00:24:19,"You know, in Lady and the Tramp, he basically pretends that he doesn't know what's happening,"
00:24:19,00:24:20,right?
00:24:20,00:24:23,He's just eating this spaghetti and he pretends he doesn't know what's happening and he turns
00:24:23,00:24:26,"around and he's like, ""Oh, now I've got to kiss the other dog."
00:24:26,00:24:29,"I don't think you could pull that off if you're licking a lollipop."""
00:24:29,00:24:32,"No, because you'd see that there's no flex and give."
00:24:32,00:24:33,Like there is in the spaghetti.
00:24:33,00:24:34,Yeah.
00:24:34,00:24:36,You're looking dead into the other person's eyes for several minutes while you lick his
00:24:36,00:24:37,eyes.
00:24:37,00:24:38,Literally.
00:24:38,00:24:42,"At the very start, everyone knows what they're getting themselves into."
00:24:42,00:24:46,"Well, actually, scientists worked out precisely how many licks it takes to lick a lollipop"
00:24:46,00:24:47,to the end.
00:24:47,00:24:48,To the tongue touching face.
00:24:48,00:24:49,They're really scientists.
00:24:49,00:24:50,"Which scientists are these, Anna?"
00:24:50,00:24:52,I just want to defend the scientists.
00:24:52,00:24:55,"They did a very important experiment and then they thought, ""How are we going to get the"
00:24:55,00:24:56,"press to pick up on this?"""
00:24:56,00:25:02,"Well, we can use this experiment to also work out how many licks to lick a lolly."
00:25:02,00:25:06,So they cooked up this hard candy and they had water currents flow over it.
00:25:06,00:25:10,"And then they calculated that it would take 2,500 licks to lick a lolly."
00:25:10,00:25:16,"It's 1,000 licks per centimetre, which I think is extraordinary and flawed because we have"
00:25:16,00:25:17,"saliva, right?"
00:25:17,00:25:19,Whereas they were using water currents.
00:25:19,00:25:22,So our saliva is much more abrasive.
00:25:22,00:25:23,Yeah.
00:25:23,00:25:24,Okay.
00:25:24,00:25:25,You'd think so.
00:25:25,00:25:26,"Lot of licks though, is what we're saying."
00:25:26,00:25:29,"Just to take us back to the lady of the trap, I think that means that you're licking for"
00:25:29,00:25:33,40 minutes before you eventually lick each other's tongues.
00:25:33,00:25:34,It's a long scene.
00:25:34,00:25:40,"Yeah, there's a director's cut available where you can actually see that original scene."
00:25:40,00:25:46,"Okay, it is time for fact number three and that is Anna."
00:25:46,00:25:52,My fact this week is that Kublai Khan's summer palace could be dismantled and folded away
00:25:52,00:25:54,at the end of every summer.
00:25:54,00:25:55,Aw.
00:25:55,00:25:56,It was clever.
00:25:56,00:25:57,Like a camping trip.
00:25:57,00:25:58,Exactly.
00:25:58,00:25:59,Yeah.
00:25:59,00:26:00,It went on a big long camping trip.
00:26:00,00:26:02,"It's sort of everyone's nightmare, except Kublai Khan."
00:26:02,00:26:03,He likes it.
00:26:03,00:26:07,"Did they have that same problem of once they dismantled it, fitting it into the bag that"
00:26:07,00:26:10,it just only seemed too big to get into?
00:26:10,00:26:11,He could never do it.
00:26:11,00:26:15,"He was always to be heard, ""Roll it, don't scrunch it."""
00:26:15,00:26:16,It was a nightmare.
00:26:16,00:26:21,"So this was in, it was Kublai Khan, who was the grandson of Genghis and extended his"
00:26:21,00:26:22,empire.
00:26:22,00:26:25,So we're talking the second half of the 13th century.
00:26:25,00:26:32,"And he had a summer capital in Shandu, or made famous as Zanadu, of course by Coleridge"
00:26:32,00:26:35,"in his poem, but it was called Shandu."
00:26:35,00:26:39,"And in his summer capital, he had this big palace and it was apparently, you know, really"
00:26:39,00:26:42,"ornate, amazing palace, huge."
00:26:42,00:26:46,And it was based on the Mongolian kind of yurt or guh design.
00:26:46,00:26:47,So they all had guhs.
00:26:47,00:26:49,They were very nomadic people.
00:26:49,00:26:53,"And so it was held up by 200 silk cords and at the end of the season, you release the"
00:26:53,00:26:56,cords and the whole thing folds up.
00:26:56,00:26:59,"Although I don't know how, because it was made of proper materials, it was made of"
00:26:59,00:27:00,canvas.
00:27:00,00:27:04,It was made of like cane and it had these huge pillars and stone dragons on top of it.
00:27:04,00:27:05,And domes.
00:27:05,00:27:06,Yeah.
00:27:06,00:27:09,There's a lot of solid stuff to go in that bag.
00:27:09,00:27:10,Yeah.
00:27:10,00:27:17,"So Kublai Khan, we should say that we largely know this from Marco Polo's account and then"
00:27:17,00:27:22,"supported by Chinese historians who, for instance, list there were five great halls, which might"
00:27:22,00:27:25,"have all been removable, because essentially the Mongols were nomadic."
00:27:25,00:27:27,This was the fundamental thing about them.
00:27:27,00:27:31,And so they just wanted new land to graze.
00:27:31,00:27:34,All their conquering was just about having new grazing land.
00:27:34,00:27:38,"And so, yeah, it took all their buildings down and buggered off the end of every season."
00:27:38,00:27:41,And they went somewhere where they could graze more easily.
00:27:41,00:27:42,Is that right?
00:27:42,00:27:43,Is that what you're saying?
00:27:43,00:27:44,No.
00:27:44,00:27:46,"This was, this, the buggering off here was just, you know, summer is over, so he went"
00:27:46,00:27:47,back to the winter capital.
00:27:47,00:27:48,Got it.
00:27:48,00:27:52,"But in all of their conquests and stuff, like one of, so obviously they conquered the biggest"
00:27:52,00:27:57,"contiguous land empire ever known to man, and they didn't care about like settling cities"
00:27:57,00:27:59,and founding big cities.
00:27:59,00:28:02,So they just flattened cities and then would leave them and go home again.
00:28:02,00:28:05,And I think people think the reason they didn't take over the whole of Europe is because once
00:28:05,00:28:08,"they got to Hungary and Poland, it wasn't such good grazing land."
00:28:08,00:28:10,So it was kind of pointless.
00:28:10,00:28:18,"So Kublai Khan was the, was he the first non-Chinese emperor of China, as it were?"
00:28:18,00:28:19,Yes.
00:28:19,00:28:20,Yeah.
00:28:20,00:28:21,Is it the Yuan dynasty?
00:28:21,00:28:22,Yeah.
00:28:22,00:28:23,It's really interesting.
00:28:23,00:28:28,One of the things that Marco Polo says about him is the introduction in amongst his group
00:28:28,00:28:30,of paper money.
00:28:30,00:28:33,"So Marco Polo writes about that, brings that back."
00:28:33,00:28:38,And just a very tiny thing is the Yuan dynasty or Yuan.
00:28:38,00:28:42,"In Chinese, another way of you put a different tone on that means money."
00:28:42,00:28:48,"And I do wonder if there's a connection to those two, because that was such a dominating"
00:28:48,00:28:50,thing for his court.
00:28:50,00:28:51,Yeah.
00:28:51,00:28:53,"And it was centred, some of it, apparently."
00:28:53,00:28:55,Some Chinese paper money was centred.
00:28:55,00:28:56,Think around about this time.
00:28:56,00:29:00,"Well, they were very big on counterfeiting right away, weren't they?"
00:29:00,00:29:02,They tried to stop every possible...
00:29:02,00:29:03,Yeah.
00:29:03,00:29:07,"But if you went to a bar in Mongolian times, they didn't take a 20-pound note, sniff it,"
00:29:07,00:29:09,"and go, ""This isn't real, did they?"""
00:29:09,00:29:12,I'm not sure that was a counterfeiting thing.
00:29:12,00:29:13,"Oh, maybe it was."
00:29:13,00:29:14,I don't know.
00:29:14,00:29:15,Maybe it was.
00:29:15,00:29:20,"But it was all mulberry bark or it sounds really cool, but actually it was a sheet of"
00:29:20,00:29:23,paper-like substance derived from the bark of mulberry trees.
00:29:23,00:29:28,And it had to be signed by multiple officials and it had pictures of the old money on it
00:29:28,00:29:31,"as well, which I think might have been a way of explaining what this is to people who weren't"
00:29:31,00:29:36,"accustomed to paper-like money, because the old money was just ropes with coins hanging"
00:29:36,00:29:37,off them.
00:29:37,00:29:41,"So it just had a picture of this, ""Hey, this is what this was, and now this is what it"
00:29:41,00:29:42,"is."""
00:29:42,00:29:43,That's so cool.
00:29:43,00:29:44,Yeah.
00:29:44,00:29:47,"That's a bit like when you have, you know, when we all got mobile phones and you'd have"
00:29:47,00:29:51,"a picture of an old-shaped phone on your mobile phone, so you knew that was what you"
00:29:51,00:29:52,pressed to call someone.
00:29:52,00:29:53,It's exactly like that.
00:29:53,00:29:54,Yeah.
00:29:54,00:29:55,That's so cool.
00:29:55,00:29:56,I love schoolomorphism.
00:29:56,00:29:57,"It's called, isn't it?"
00:29:57,00:29:58,Yeah.
00:29:58,00:30:00,Or a picture of a floppy disk being the sign to save something.
00:30:00,00:30:01,Yeah.
00:30:01,00:30:03,Or a picture of a carrot to sell dildos.
00:30:03,00:30:04,Yeah.
00:30:04,00:30:05,Yeah.
00:30:05,00:30:06,Sure.
00:30:06,00:30:12,"Because he had such a big empire, Kublikan, it meant that people could travel from all"
00:30:12,00:30:15,the way from Europe all the way to the other side of Asia.
00:30:15,00:30:19,"And that's obviously why Marco Polo managed to get across there, because before that,"
00:30:19,00:30:23,it was really difficult to traverse those areas.
00:30:23,00:30:29,"So what's the deal with Marco Polo in that I, the last that I'd read or was told about"
00:30:29,00:30:33,"him is that, you know, he might have been a fraud or that these weren't trustworthy."
00:30:33,00:30:40,"But all the places that he described, like we know where Xanadu was, we've found the"
00:30:40,00:30:45,"dragon statues, we found he got the perimeter sizes wrong, but they were not too far wrong."
00:30:45,00:30:47,"Well, he was blindfolded a lot of the time, Marco Polo."
00:30:47,00:30:49,So that's why he wasn't able to...
00:30:49,00:30:53,"There are theories, but they're still pretty unusual that he genuinely didn't get there."
00:30:53,00:30:57,I find it totally implausible because he wrote about it in so much detail and it was possible
00:30:57,00:30:58,to access.
00:30:58,00:31:00,And other people went there as well from the West.
00:31:00,00:31:02,William Brubrick was another one.
00:31:02,00:31:05,But people used things like he didn't mention the Great Wall of China.
00:31:05,00:31:06,Yeah.
00:31:06,00:31:08,"But actually, the Great Wall of China, it wasn't really that great at that time."
00:31:08,00:31:09,So not really worth mentioning.
00:31:09,00:31:14,"There's people in China who still don't know what the Great Wall of China is, genuinely,"
00:31:14,00:31:17,"because they've not been up in space, have they?"
00:31:17,00:31:19,So they've not been able to see it.
00:31:19,00:31:24,"I think the argument is, and I don't subscribe to it either, that he got the stories from"
00:31:24,00:31:28,other people and he wrote them down rather than him actually going and experiencing it.
00:31:28,00:31:31,"That's the argument, I think."
00:31:31,00:31:35,"Another guy who did go and experience the Mongols was this guy called William Brubrick,"
00:31:35,00:31:36,who was a bit of a Marco Polo.
00:31:36,00:31:41,"He was a Franciscan, we talked about Franciscans recently, he was a missionary."
00:31:41,00:31:45,"And he revealed to us a serious problem with the Khan dynasties, with the Mongol dynasties,"
00:31:45,00:31:47,which was alcoholism.
00:31:47,00:31:49,So a lot of them had a real issue with this.
00:31:49,00:31:54,He talked about this amazing thing called the silvertree of Karakorum in the Mongol capital.
00:31:54,00:31:56,And it sounds extraordinary.
00:31:56,00:32:02,"So it was a huge tall silvertree in the center, and it had an angel, sort of angel-type fairy"
00:32:02,00:32:07,"figure with a trumpet on top of it, and then it had lions all around it, and the lions"
00:32:07,00:32:09,would spout a different drink from their mouths.
00:32:09,00:32:14,"So there were four lions, and the lions produced grape wine, fermented maize milk, rice wine,"
00:32:14,00:32:18,"and honey mead, depending on which you fancy."
00:32:18,00:32:22,"And the way it worked, well, the way it was supposed to work was that the angel on top"
00:32:22,00:32:25,"of the fountain was an automaton, and he blew some bellows at the bottom."
00:32:25,00:32:28,"It played a trumpet, servants rushed out and filled it."
00:32:28,00:32:32,"But the angel automaton never worked, and so what they had to be was a man inside the"
00:32:32,00:32:37,"trunk of the tree at all times with a trumpet, who as soon as the emperor decided he wanted"
00:32:37,00:32:41,"a drink, had to blow the trumpet so it looked like the angel was blowing it, and then everyone"
00:32:41,00:32:42,flocked in to refill it.
00:32:42,00:32:43,But then how amazing is that?
00:32:43,00:32:48,"He'd have a party, and there'd be lion fountains spouting every drink of his choice."
00:32:48,00:32:49,That's so good.
00:32:49,00:32:50,Pretty good.
00:32:50,00:32:51,That's amazing.
00:32:51,00:32:55,"I probably would have replaced the maize milk with, like, maybe sangria."
00:32:55,00:32:56,But that's just me.
00:32:56,00:32:57,That's what I like.
00:32:57,00:32:58,Yeah.
00:32:58,00:33:00,Maybe the later dynasties went there.
00:33:00,00:33:03,"It's like those magical machines that you get in Nandos, which have five different kinds"
00:33:03,00:33:06,"of soft drink in them, basically."
00:33:06,00:33:08,It's cut based on that.
00:33:08,00:33:14,"They actually have a very small man inside them, with a pair of bellows."
00:33:14,00:33:17,I do actually have another Nandos-related Kublai Khan fact.
00:33:17,00:33:18,Do you mean another?
00:33:18,00:33:21,That last one wasn't related to Nandos.
00:33:21,00:33:24,You just shoe-horned it in.
00:33:24,00:33:26,It's so true.
00:33:26,00:33:30,"Whenever he had his raw horse meat, he used to put a little flag in it, didn't he?"
00:33:30,00:33:34,"He'd say, ""How spicy you want to be?"""
00:33:34,00:33:40,"Well, if you thought that lick was tenuous James, you'd wait till you hear this one."
00:33:40,00:33:44,"One of Andy's famous sugois, or whatever it was you were calling them, sugoi."
00:33:44,00:33:50,"I think that Kublai Khan basically invented the Nandos black card, which is a card where"
00:33:50,00:33:53,"you get free Nandos forever if you have this, right?"
00:33:53,00:33:54,Yeah.
00:33:54,00:33:55,That's what the Nandos black card is.
00:33:55,00:34:00,Kublai Khan had a bit of a correspondence with the then Pope.
00:34:00,00:34:05,"Obviously, this is incredibly difficult to do because you're thousands of miles away"
00:34:05,00:34:06,and transporting letters to the nightmare.
00:34:06,00:34:13,"But he sent Khan, this is, sent an ambassador with a paisa, which is a golden tablet, which"
00:34:13,00:34:16,is three inches wide and one foot long.
00:34:16,00:34:23,"What the paisa does is, it authorizes the holder to free food and lodging anywhere throughout"
00:34:23,00:34:24,Kublai Khan's dominion.
00:34:24,00:34:28,"So, it's effectively a Nandos black card for a whole country."
00:34:28,00:34:29,Yes.
00:34:29,00:34:30,"No, I'm going to give you that."
00:34:30,00:34:31,Andy.
00:34:31,00:34:32,Yeah.
00:34:32,00:34:34,Marco Polo had one of those as well.
00:34:34,00:34:35,Did he?
00:34:35,00:34:36,Yeah.
00:34:36,00:34:42,"Marco Polo, when he left to come back to Italy, he was given one of these golden tablets and"
00:34:42,00:34:47,it worked brilliantly until he reached the stronghold of his influence and it got weaker
00:34:47,00:34:48,and weaker.
00:34:48,00:34:52,"At that point, the gold tablet meant nothing and they started getting beat up and they started"
00:34:52,00:34:53,losing the clothes.
00:34:53,00:34:58,"That's what led to basically him arriving back as a Ruffian, supposedly, and being jailed."
00:34:58,00:34:59,Really?
00:34:59,00:35:00,Yeah.
00:35:00,00:35:03,It's like when he tried to pay with Scottish money for something at the corner.
00:35:03,00:35:07,"I'm like, no, this is legit, I promise you."
00:35:07,00:35:11,"So the person who made it for the whole dynasty was Genghis, right?"
00:35:11,00:35:15,"And he started off really poverty-stricken, so he started off being a hunter-gatherer"
00:35:15,00:35:19,"because he was basically exiled, but he was born, this is this weird thing, he was born"
00:35:19,00:35:25,"with a clot of blood in his hand, apparently, which meant that you were going to be a great"
00:35:25,00:35:26,ruler.
00:35:26,00:35:29,"I mean, obviously he wasn't, if we don't believe in the mythology of these times, but if you're"
00:35:29,00:35:34,"a Mongol, a clot of blood in his hand and it was a sign that he was going to be ruthless"
00:35:34,00:35:35,and he was.
00:35:35,00:35:40,"So once he massacred, as well as massacring an entire city, he massacred all the pets,"
00:35:40,00:35:44,all the cats and dogs and cows and camels in the city as well.
00:35:44,00:35:47,What an awful person.
00:35:47,00:35:50,"He was a bad guy, but he really liked loyalty."
00:35:50,00:35:51,He was a good guy to his mates.
00:35:51,00:35:55,"He was one of those, if you're friends with him, he's really good to you."
00:35:55,00:35:59,"He was in one battle and someone almost killed him, shooting his horse out from underneath"
00:35:59,00:36:00,him.
00:36:00,00:36:03,"And he sort of stopped the battle, took a bunch of them prisoner and was like, who was"
00:36:03,00:36:06,it who almost shot that horse out from under me?
00:36:06,00:36:09,"And the guy put his hand up for some reason and Genghis said, okay, you, that was a great"
00:36:09,00:36:11,"shot, come on my side."
00:36:11,00:36:14,"And this guy ended up being one of his most important generals, helped him conquer the"
00:36:14,00:36:15,world.
00:36:15,00:36:16,Wow.
00:36:16,00:36:17,"Genghis, good sign."
00:36:17,00:36:22,"When he went through the Middle East trying to siege all these cities, the reason that"
00:36:22,00:36:28,they were so good is they had these massive catapults and their catapults were amazing.
00:36:28,00:36:32,And they would fire the stones at the city walls and then eventually they would have
00:36:32,00:36:33,to give up.
00:36:33,00:36:38,"And they were so important that if, you know how they killed all the dogs and cats and stuff"
00:36:38,00:36:39,like that.
00:36:39,00:36:42,"Well, they wouldn't kill the engineers of the city."
00:36:42,00:36:46,They give them a chance to kind of come over to the Mongol side because they knew how important
00:36:46,00:36:48,the engineers were.
00:36:48,00:36:52,"And if they agreed, then they would come over and they become part of the Mongol army."
00:36:52,00:36:57,"And there was one city in China somewhere, I can't remember what it's called."
00:36:57,00:37:01,"And they heard about this, that this was happening and they heard the Mongols were coming and"
00:37:01,00:37:04,they decided to get rid of all the stones from the area.
00:37:04,00:37:09,"So for a couple of days, they literally within about a mile circle, they grabbed every single"
00:37:09,00:37:12,stone they could find and brought it into the city.
00:37:12,00:37:16,"But then what the Mongols did instead was they got some mulberry trees, chopped them"
00:37:16,00:37:20,"down, put them in water, left them out to dry and they became rock hard and they could"
00:37:20,00:37:24,use those instead of stones to fire in the city.
00:37:24,00:37:29,Now there's some argument that they weren't good enough and in the end they had to bring
00:37:29,00:37:33,"in some stones from somewhere else because they had like a, like a postal service for"
00:37:33,00:37:39,"stones that they used sometimes where they kept like storage of stones, like an Amazon"
00:37:39,00:37:43,"storage site of parcels, but they would keep stones in all these different places."
00:37:43,00:37:44,Really?
00:37:44,00:37:48,"Yeah, they would be like one day's ride away and they bring the stones to each place."
00:37:48,00:37:50,So there's an argument that they might have done that or it might have been these mulberry
00:37:50,00:37:51,trees.
00:37:51,00:37:52,We don't know.
00:37:52,00:37:53,That's so funny.
00:37:53,00:37:54,That's so expensive.
00:37:54,00:37:57,"If you're shipping stones internationally, it's hard enough to ship a hardback book,"
00:37:57,00:38:00,but imagine like a hundred bricks or something.
00:38:00,00:38:04,And you're asking for next day delivery on a lot of these stones.
00:38:04,00:38:09,"Presumably though, you could catapult it to the area you want to get it."
00:38:09,00:38:11,That's such a good idea.
00:38:11,00:38:14,Just catapult on to the next catapult.
00:38:14,00:38:16,"I don't think they even thought of that, Doug."
00:38:16,00:38:18,Only even in charge.
00:38:18,00:38:23,They used to also tie trees to their horses if they didn't need the trees to be replacement
00:38:23,00:38:24,rocks.
00:38:24,00:38:28,So they had all these clever tactics for scaring the enemy and one of them was tying trees
00:38:28,00:38:29,to the horses that didn't have riders.
00:38:29,00:38:31,So it sounded like they had a much bigger army than they did.
00:38:31,00:38:32,Sorry.
00:38:32,00:38:33,The horses would sound much heavier.
00:38:33,00:38:34,They were just hanging along a tree.
00:38:34,00:38:35,Okay.
00:38:35,00:38:36,Sorry.
00:38:36,00:38:41,Tying trees to the horses makes it just sound like you're tying your horse to a tree.
00:38:41,00:38:42,Sorry.
00:38:42,00:38:43,But you're getting it wrong.
00:38:43,00:38:46,There's a very big difference between tying your tree to a horse and trying to get a horse
00:38:46,00:38:47,to a tree.
00:38:47,00:38:48,It's a completely different thing.
00:38:48,00:38:54,"Imagine being the one guy who's just standing there going, ""I don't understand this tactic."
00:38:54,00:38:58,"Where's everyone gone?"""
00:38:58,00:39:00,"Oh, no."
00:39:00,00:39:01,"Oh, embarrassing."
00:39:01,00:39:02,Yeah.
00:39:02,00:39:03,Sorry.
00:39:03,00:39:05,Tying trees and branches.
00:39:05,00:39:09,And they did things like they banged metal pots together and they ruffled bells when
00:39:09,00:39:14,they galloped into battle so that the opposing army couldn't hear each other shout instructions.
00:39:14,00:39:15,They wanted it into battle.
00:39:15,00:39:19,"When they were going into battle, they would bang metal pots and pans together and they'd"
00:39:19,00:39:20,rung lots of bells and stuff.
00:39:20,00:39:24,And that meant that the opposition couldn't hear each other shout out.
00:39:24,00:39:25,That's really interesting.
00:39:25,00:39:29,You won't be able to hear yourself think.
00:39:29,00:39:32,But that's what happens in American football.
00:39:32,00:39:36,"When the other team's on offense and they need to make all their signals, you get your"
00:39:36,00:39:40,fans to make as much noise as possible so that they can't get the signals across.
00:39:40,00:39:41,"Oh, wow."
00:39:41,00:39:42,And it means that they can't do it.
00:39:42,00:39:44,So that is a really common thing in American football.
00:39:44,00:39:45,Wow.
00:39:45,00:39:48,"And then you slaughter the entire opponent, didn't you?"
00:39:48,00:39:49,Yes.
00:39:49,00:39:50,Hang on.
00:39:50,00:39:54,"Just to go back to this tying your tree to a horse thing, doesn't that..."
00:39:54,00:39:58,And so the idea is the enemy thinks you've got a much bigger army because it sounds bigger.
00:39:58,00:40:00,"This rumbler's bigger, isn't it?"
00:40:00,00:40:01,"Well, the rumbler's bigger."
00:40:01,00:40:07,"But this only works in a place where the enemy can hear you but not see you, for one thing."
00:40:07,00:40:08,"Well, no."
00:40:08,00:40:12,"If you're running with an army, presumably a lot of this is going to be on dirt, there's"
00:40:12,00:40:15,"going to be a lot of dust raising, you're going to create..."
00:40:15,00:40:16,It's all theatrics.
00:40:16,00:40:18,That's thought it through.
00:40:18,00:40:19,You really should have been in charge.
00:40:19,00:40:20,You're so right.
00:40:20,00:40:23,"The Mongolian desert, there's sand everywhere."
00:40:23,00:40:24,You can't see a thing.
00:40:24,00:40:27,But the reason Dad didn't go there is because of the death worms they have in Mongolia.
00:40:27,00:40:32,They're killed by lightning bolts from the Anus.
00:40:32,00:40:34,"No, thank you."
00:40:34,00:40:41,"This Kubla Khan, Samuel Taylor Coleridge, sort of immortalized Xanadu in that great poem"
00:40:41,00:40:42,of his.
00:40:42,00:40:45,And this is such a basic thing that I didn't know.
00:40:45,00:40:49,"So I'm saying it for the other people out there who did not know this, even though 90%"
00:40:49,00:40:50,of you will.
00:40:50,00:40:55,"He never finished the poem because someone knocked at his door, a person from Porlock,"
00:40:55,00:40:58,and he lost his creative thread and didn't know how to finish it.
00:40:58,00:41:02,And I didn't realize that that's become a term that you use for when creativity is
00:41:02,00:41:07,"disrupted, when your inspiration suddenly goes because of some exterior thing."
00:41:07,00:41:12,"A person from Porlock has come is the term to say, I've lost my thread of creativity."
00:41:12,00:41:16,"I think it's fair, Dan, that that is not an extremely common phrase that people use"
00:41:16,00:41:17,all the time.
00:41:17,00:41:18,"Oh, really?"
00:41:18,00:41:19,"Yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:41:19,00:41:21,I wouldn't say 90% of the people listening to this.
00:41:21,00:41:25,"If you're listening to this, you're not in a 10% of people who didn't know this."
00:41:25,00:41:27,"Because you just say, it's not that common."
00:41:27,00:41:30,"Well, it's a way to make all of our listeners feel very stupid."
00:41:30,00:41:35,"Well, I was in the category, but then that's even more insulting, I guess."
00:41:35,00:41:36,Yeah.
00:41:36,00:41:39,"So, so he wrote it in this opium haze."
00:41:39,00:41:45,He was inspired after reading about the description of Xanadu in Marco Polo's accounts.
00:41:45,00:41:47,"And it never got, now I haven't actually read it myself."
00:41:47,00:41:49,So does it just cut off?
00:41:49,00:41:50,Or?
00:41:50,00:41:51,Yeah.
00:41:51,00:41:53,It just writes about a person from Poloq at the end of the door.
00:41:53,00:41:54,It doesn't write into the poem.
00:41:54,00:41:55,"Oh, sorry."
00:41:55,00:41:56,Who's that at the door?
00:41:56,00:41:57,Hang on.
00:41:57,00:41:58,I'll be back in a minute.
00:41:58,00:41:59,I've got a great idea for the ending.
00:41:59,00:42:02,"And then he comes back and he's like, oh, I've got to rhyme something with ending now."
00:42:02,00:42:04,What am I going to do?
00:42:04,00:42:08,"No, it does stop halfway through."
00:42:08,00:42:11,"And actually a lot of people think that there was no person from Poloq, and it was just"
00:42:11,00:42:12,an excuse.
00:42:12,00:42:16,And a lot of people think that it might be just because he was off his face on opium
00:42:16,00:42:17,that he maybe didn't finish it.
00:42:17,00:42:25,"OK, it is time for our final fact of the show and that is Andy."
00:42:25,00:42:30,"My fact is that according to the people who have drunk it, billion year old water tastes"
00:42:30,00:42:31,terrible.
00:42:31,00:42:32,I know.
00:42:32,00:42:33,Shock.
00:42:33,00:42:34,I know.
00:42:34,00:42:42,So this doesn't make any sense because I've got some water right here and I've been drinking
00:42:42,00:42:43,it.
00:42:43,00:42:46,"And this water here, I would say, is more than a billion years old."
00:42:46,00:42:47,Really?
00:42:47,00:42:51,"This water is like four billion years old or something, twelve billion years old."
00:42:51,00:42:52,And it tastes fine to me.
00:42:52,00:42:53,"All water, surely."
00:42:53,00:42:54,Surely it's been cleaned.
00:42:54,00:42:55,It's been...
00:42:55,00:42:56,No.
00:42:56,00:42:57,"So you don't make water, do you?"
00:42:57,00:42:58,"Like, the earth doesn't make water."
00:42:58,00:43:02,The water that we have now is the same water as when the dinosaurs were around.
00:43:02,00:43:07,So I'm receiving a lot of early challenges on this fact and I'll go into it a bit more.
00:43:07,00:43:13,So you're absolutely right that pretty much all the water on the planet is unbelievably
00:43:13,00:43:17,old and may well be much older than a billion years.
00:43:17,00:43:23,This is a body or a pocket of water which was found by a team of Canadian scientists
00:43:23,00:43:28,"led by Barbara Sherwood Lola, who is an earth sciences professor."
00:43:28,00:43:34,"And she and her team found a bit of water about a mile down in Canada, beneath a mine."
00:43:34,00:43:39,And this pocket has been isolated from the rest of the world for over a billion years.
00:43:39,00:43:44,So pretty much all of the water on the planet is part of the water cycle where it will cycle
00:43:44,00:43:45,into the oceans.
00:43:45,00:43:46,It'll cycle into clouds.
00:43:46,00:43:48,It'll maybe go into underground aquifers.
00:43:48,00:43:53,But this stuff that she found and her team has been isolated for up to two and a half
00:43:53,00:43:54,billion years.
00:43:54,00:43:57,"It's really, really, really, you know, it's been kept separate."
00:43:57,00:43:59,It's not been in circulation.
00:43:59,00:44:03,And she was interviewed about it a few years ago and she says she tastes it from time to
00:44:03,00:44:07,time and it always tastes terrible.
00:44:07,00:44:10,And she doesn't let her students do it because obviously there isn't a huge amount of this
00:44:10,00:44:11,stuff to go around.
00:44:11,00:44:12,And so.
00:44:12,00:44:14,"So this is a common thing, apparently, right?"
00:44:14,00:44:18,Geologists just go around licking and tasting the stuff that they're investigating.
00:44:18,00:44:22,She was saying to find because apparently you can get an immediate read if you get at that
00:44:22,00:44:26,kind of thing of the kinds of minerals and stuff or the extent of the minerals.
00:44:26,00:44:30,"And she did say that if you're a geologist who works with rocks, you've licked a lot of"
00:44:30,00:44:31,rocks.
00:44:31,00:44:32,Yeah.
00:44:32,00:44:33,Which is quite weird.
00:44:33,00:44:35,The point is that she's looking for the oldest water in the world.
00:44:35,00:44:36,That's like what their job is.
00:44:36,00:44:38,That's what they're looking for.
00:44:38,00:44:43,"And the older it is, the saltier it gets because it means all the bits from the rocks are leached"
00:44:43,00:44:44,into it.
00:44:44,00:44:47,"So as you're going, you're kind of licking little bits of water to get saltier and saltier"
00:44:47,00:44:48,and saltier.
00:44:48,00:44:51,And the most salty one you get is probably the oldest.
00:44:51,00:44:52,Right.
00:44:52,00:44:53,Yeah.
00:44:53,00:44:54,So that's why she does that.
00:44:54,00:44:58,"If that was her job, she did a bloody good job of it because the previous record holder"
00:44:58,00:45:00,was only tens of millions of years old.
00:45:00,00:45:05,"So she's not only found one that's older, but by almost two and a half billion years."
00:45:05,00:45:06,It's pretty good going.
00:45:06,00:45:10,The reason that they realized that this one is so much older than any they found before
00:45:10,00:45:13,is they've got a new technique of checking how old things are.
00:45:13,00:45:18,"And by using this new technique, which was, I think, discovered by the University of Manchester"
00:45:18,00:45:24,"in England, they kind of looked at the isotopes of various gases which are found in this water."
00:45:24,00:45:29,"And by doing that, I won't explain exactly how you do that because it's pretty obvious"
00:45:29,00:45:30,for everyone.
00:45:30,00:45:34,"But basically, you work out how many of certain isotopes of these noble gases are in your"
00:45:34,00:45:39,"water, and that will tell you when it kind of landed there in your aquifer."
00:45:39,00:45:40,Yeah.
00:45:40,00:45:47,"But to go back to Anna's original complaint about this fact, it is bizarre that water is"
00:45:47,00:45:51,- there's a lot of water which is older than the sun.
00:45:51,00:45:52,Most water is older than the sun.
00:45:52,00:45:53,Yeah.
00:45:53,00:45:54,Four billion years old.
00:45:54,00:45:55,Four and a half billion years old.
00:45:55,00:45:56,Is that bizarre?
00:45:56,00:46:00,You don't find it bizarre that the water on the planet is older than the rock?
00:46:00,00:46:01,"Well, I know."
00:46:01,00:46:02,I find it bizarre.
00:46:02,00:46:03,But I know that we have a lot of alien water.
00:46:03,00:46:04,So it's...
00:46:04,00:46:05,Yeah.
00:46:05,00:46:08,That's the thing I'm saying is bizarre that there's a lot of alien water which predates
00:46:08,00:46:09,the planet forming.
00:46:09,00:46:10,Yeah.
00:46:10,00:46:11,I think that's mad.
00:46:11,00:46:12,It is mad.
00:46:12,00:46:13,He's right.
00:46:13,00:46:18,"So most of the water that we have on earth, we think, actually it's interesting because"
00:46:18,00:46:23,"no one really knows where all the water comes from, but we think most of it comes from asteroids"
00:46:23,00:46:27,because you can look at the chemical compositions of your water and notice that it's quite similar
00:46:27,00:46:29,to what you find in asteroids.
00:46:29,00:46:34,But some of it has come from the actual formation of the sun itself.
00:46:34,00:46:39,"So when the sun forms, all these bits come together to make this massive body in space,"
00:46:39,00:46:43,"but some of it becomes what's called the solar nebula, which is like a gaseous part of the"
00:46:43,00:46:46,sun which doesn't become the sun itself.
00:46:46,00:46:50,And apparently a lot of that stuff has come down to earth and become some of the water.
00:46:50,00:46:52,So it didn't all come from asteroids.
00:46:52,00:46:54,Some of it came from the formation of the sun.
00:46:54,00:47:01,"And apparently for every 100 molecules of water, one or two come from the solar nebula."
00:47:01,00:47:06,So Anna's big jug of water that she's drinking from at the moment will have millions and
00:47:06,00:47:10,"millions, well, way more than millions of molecules that came from the formation of"
00:47:10,00:47:11,the sun.
00:47:11,00:47:14,But most of it will have probably come from asteroids.
00:47:14,00:47:19,And that could be why water evaporates if you believe in a fringe theory because the
00:47:19,00:47:25,"sun causes water to evaporate because it wants its water back, so it's trying to suck it"
00:47:25,00:47:26,back up.
00:47:26,00:47:27,"I mean, yeah."
00:47:27,00:47:29,It's just a new theory.
00:47:29,00:47:30,But why it would put itself out?
00:47:30,00:47:33,"It sounds like a brand new theory, Anna."
00:47:33,00:47:37,"Oh my God, there is so much going wrong in these last few things that people have said."
00:47:37,00:47:39,We should move on.
00:47:39,00:47:41,Just leave that as accepted facts.
00:47:41,00:47:42,Move on.
00:47:42,00:47:48,"Just to go into slightly more kind of human timescales of water, do you know why water"
00:47:48,00:47:51,tastes weird when you've left it overnight?
00:47:51,00:47:56,It's gone funky because flies have gone in there and...
00:47:56,00:47:57,Yeah.
00:47:57,00:48:00,James' glasses of water are always full of flies floating.
00:48:00,00:48:01,"No, they've flown off again."
00:48:01,00:48:05,They kind of go in for a little bath in the evening when I'm not around.
00:48:05,00:48:07,"James, you have to sort out your fly situation."
00:48:07,00:48:09,"No, that's not it."
00:48:09,00:48:15,It's that carbon dioxide from the air has dissolved in the water and it's formed carbonic
00:48:15,00:48:16,acid.
00:48:16,00:48:19,"So basically, according to one article I read about it, you're basically drinking very,"
00:48:19,00:48:22,very mild acid rain the next morning.
00:48:22,00:48:23,Wow.
00:48:23,00:48:24,It was really interesting.
00:48:24,00:48:30,"This is a bit of a personal story, but I'm in Sussex at the moment and had visitors come"
00:48:30,00:48:35,recently from Oxfordshire when it was after the time when you were allowed to have visitors.
00:48:35,00:48:38,And they came from Oxfordshire and one of them had a bottle of water they brought from Oxford
00:48:38,00:48:43,"and we tasted it and then they tasted the water here and said, ""Oh, Sussex water is so delicious,"
00:48:43,00:48:44,isn't it?
00:48:44,00:48:45,"So much nicer."""
00:48:45,00:48:49,So we were talking about and we all could tell immediately by just the smell of the
00:48:49,00:48:51,"water, we did blind taste testing, which came from where?"
00:48:51,00:48:56,"You can 100% tell the difference from certain places, like from the difference between Bolton"
00:48:56,00:49:02,"and London is it might as well be a different liquid, it just tastes nothing like it."
00:49:02,00:49:06,"It's Bolton, sometimes it's because of the rocks, this is because of the chemicals that"
00:49:06,00:49:08,"are added in Oxfordshire, which is more chemicals."
00:49:08,00:49:12,"With us is because we have soft water in Bolton, but we have hard water in London, which is"
00:49:12,00:49:16,"just like, it might as well be orange juice and lemon juice, it's completely different."
00:49:16,00:49:20,I wonder if there's anyone who can tell every single county by the taste of the water.
00:49:20,00:49:27,"Well, in 2016 they did a taste test of all the different waters in the UK with a group"
00:49:27,00:49:31,of judges that included Michelin star chef Tom Aitkins.
00:49:31,00:49:35,So these were experts on water and they tasted them all and they said that the best tasting
00:49:35,00:49:42,"tap water was the West Midlands, it was found in the West Midlands and the worst was served"
00:49:42,00:49:45,"by Wessex water, which included bath and Bristol."
00:49:45,00:49:53,"But that was because the water was polluted by a statue of a slave trader, but now apparently"
00:49:53,00:49:58,"according to, but then you see these every kind of few, every couple of years they come"
00:49:58,00:50:01,up with a new survey and someone else is the best and someone else is the worst.
00:50:01,00:50:02,Yeah.
00:50:02,00:50:07,"But that's very embarrassing bath, trading on its water presentries."
00:50:07,00:50:11,"I suppose they're quite sulfurous are they in bath, is that the whole point of the bath?"
00:50:11,00:50:15,"The actual springs are, yeah, that you can buy you to cost 50p for a glass of the actual"
00:50:15,00:50:19,"springs water and it's so eggy, it's really gross."
00:50:19,00:50:21,People used to order it by delivery though.
00:50:21,00:50:26,"So back when bath became a thing, it became, there was the resurgence of bath."
00:50:26,00:50:30,"So bath was a big deal in Roman times because of the spa and then the 18th and 19th centuries,"
00:50:30,00:50:34,"people like Jane Austen in coast, I had holidaying there to take the waters, which were thought"
00:50:34,00:50:39,to be very curative and you'd visit to cure your sickness and sometimes it worked because
00:50:39,00:50:43,"water was very polluted let's say in London, but you visit to cure your sickness, but sometimes"
00:50:43,00:50:48,people didn't have weeks to spare to go holidaying in bath and that's where the bottled water
00:50:48,00:50:49,industry started.
00:50:49,00:50:54,"So they'd write to bath and say, oh, can I just have water delivered and you'd get subscriptions"
00:50:54,00:50:56,of spa water delivered to you once a month.
00:50:56,00:50:57,Wow.
00:50:57,00:50:58,That's amazing.
00:50:58,00:51:04,"So they also invented the subscription meal service, did they?"
00:51:04,00:51:11,They did. Podcasts in the 19th century would advertise.
00:51:11,00:51:15,"Do you know, we talk about the oldest water, the oldest rock, the oldest earth rock."
00:51:15,00:51:16,Do you know where they found that?
00:51:16,00:51:18,Is it in space?
00:51:18,00:51:19,Yes.
00:51:19,00:51:20,On the moon?
00:51:20,00:51:21,On the moon.
00:51:21,00:51:22,Yeah.
00:51:22,00:51:27,The oldest rock that they think belongs to the earth and that was formed on the earth
00:51:27,00:51:32,was found on the moon by the Apollo 14 crew in 1971.
00:51:32,00:51:36,They brought down the load of samples and this particular one has got all the right isotopes
00:51:36,00:51:38,or whatever to think that it did come from the earth.
00:51:38,00:51:39,Wow.
00:51:39,00:51:43,"And they reckoned that what happened was an asteroid hit the earth really, really early"
00:51:43,00:51:49,on in its development and it flew a load of stuff into space and then this kind of went
00:51:49,00:51:52,"around, went around, went around and eventually landed on the moon when the moon formed."
00:51:52,00:51:57,The moon was a lot closer to the earth in those days and then was found by these astronauts
00:51:57,00:51:58,in 1971.
00:51:58,00:52:00,You would be furious if you were NASA.
00:52:00,00:52:03,"If you were NASA and you said, ""Right, guys, can you bring back some moon rocks?"""
00:52:03,00:52:06,You don't mind like literally any bloody rock you could find.
00:52:06,00:52:08,"It's all moon rock, isn't it?"
00:52:08,00:52:11,Thank God the Apollo 11 astronauts didn't bring it back.
00:52:11,00:52:20,That would not have helped the conspiracy theories.
00:52:20,00:52:21,"Okay, that's it."
00:52:21,00:52:22,That is all of our facts.

00:53:19,00:53:21,Did you just forget the words to the intro?
00:53:21,00:53:24,"Yeah, I human buffered."
00:53:24,00:53:28,It's not the internet.
00:53:28,00:53:30,"Your brain has been buffering for a long time, hasn't it, Dad?"
00:53:30,00:53:31,It's really odd.
00:53:31,00:53:32,It's a big rainbow wheel.
