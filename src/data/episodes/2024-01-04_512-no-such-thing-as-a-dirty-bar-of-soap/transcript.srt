1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,340
 (upbeat music)

2
00:00:02,340 --> 00:00:05,000
 - Hey everyone, welcome to the very first episode

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:08,280
 of Fish in the Year 2024.

4
00:00:08,280 --> 00:00:09,680
 This is gonna be a really big year for us.

5
00:00:09,680 --> 00:00:11,000
 We're incredibly excited.

6
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:12,840
 It's our 10 year anniversary.

7
00:00:12,840 --> 00:00:14,800
 10 years of fish this March.

8
00:00:14,800 --> 00:00:18,360
 That's over 500 episodes, 29,000 facts.

9
00:00:18,360 --> 00:00:23,120
 Actually, so far 29,597 facts, to be exact.

10
00:00:23,120 --> 00:00:25,240
 We know that because Andy keeps a spreadsheet.

11
00:00:25,240 --> 00:00:27,880
 So thanks to everyone who's been tuning in all this time.

12
00:00:27,880 --> 00:00:29,420
 I hope you had a great holiday break.

13
00:00:29,420 --> 00:00:31,000
 Hope you had a great New Year's.

14
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:32,760
 We got a great episode for you today.

15
00:00:32,760 --> 00:00:34,480
 James is away on holiday at the moment.

16
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:38,120
 So in his place, we have another James, a Reese James.

17
00:00:38,120 --> 00:00:39,680
 I'm sure you're all aware of Reese James.

18
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:41,720
 He's an amazing stand-up comedian.

19
00:00:41,720 --> 00:00:44,360
 He's appeared on multiple TV shows and radio shows.

20
00:00:44,360 --> 00:00:47,160
 Most predominantly I would say as a regular or mock the week,

21
00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:49,240
 where for years he was a panelist.

22
00:00:49,240 --> 00:00:51,520
 And actually, if you go to Reese's Instagram account,

23
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:54,840
 which is @ReeceJamesy, so that's Reese James,

24
00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:56,280
 but with a Y at the end,

25
00:00:56,280 --> 00:00:58,520
 you'll find the funniest Instagram account out there

26
00:00:58,520 --> 00:00:59,820
 in my personal opinion.

27
00:00:59,820 --> 00:01:01,740
 It's the reason I basically stayed on Instagram

28
00:01:01,740 --> 00:01:02,580
 for a long time.

29
00:01:02,580 --> 00:01:04,900
 He's uploaded all of his single one-liners

30
00:01:04,900 --> 00:01:06,660
 that he's delivered on the show mock the week

31
00:01:06,660 --> 00:01:07,660
 from over the years.

32
00:01:07,660 --> 00:01:09,940
 And honestly, you will be in tears laughing.

33
00:01:09,940 --> 00:01:12,180
 So get that into your life, follow him there.

34
00:01:12,180 --> 00:01:14,500
 And if you want more long-form stuff by him,

35
00:01:14,500 --> 00:01:15,780
 you can go to his YouTube account

36
00:01:15,780 --> 00:01:17,680
 where you'll find an entire radio show

37
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:18,940
 that's been uploaded there.

38
00:01:18,940 --> 00:01:21,020
 And that's called Reese Search.

39
00:01:21,020 --> 00:01:24,900
 As in Reese's name, but mixed with research, Reese Search.

40
00:01:24,900 --> 00:01:27,340
 And to describe that show the best way would be to say

41
00:01:27,340 --> 00:01:29,220
 it's answering all of life's big questions,

42
00:01:29,220 --> 00:01:32,000
 but done in a sort of brass-eye mold.

43
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,620
 It's incredibly funny and you must check it out.

44
00:01:34,620 --> 00:01:36,400
 But in the meantime, don't go anywhere

45
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:39,340
 'cause you can enjoy him here on No Such Thing as a Fish.

46
00:01:39,340 --> 00:01:41,280
 So here we go, on with the show.

47
00:01:54,780 --> 00:01:57,680
 Hello and welcome to another episode

48
00:01:57,680 --> 00:02:00,180
 of No Such Thing as a Fish, a weekly podcast

49
00:02:00,180 --> 00:02:02,620
 coming to you from the QI offices in Hoburn.

50
00:02:02,620 --> 00:02:04,620
 My name is Dan Schreiber, I am sitting here

51
00:02:04,620 --> 00:02:08,380
 with Anna Tyshinski, Andrew Hunter Murray, and Reese James.

52
00:02:08,380 --> 00:02:10,380
 And once again, we have gathered around the microphones

53
00:02:10,380 --> 00:02:12,860
 with our four favorite facts from the last seven days.

54
00:02:12,860 --> 00:02:15,540
 And in no particular order, here we go.

55
00:02:15,540 --> 00:02:19,300
 Starting with fact number one, and that is Reese.

56
00:02:19,300 --> 00:02:23,620
 - Soap is the best way to move a building.

57
00:02:23,620 --> 00:02:24,740
 How do you feel about that?

58
00:02:24,740 --> 00:02:27,260
 - That was so dramatically presented.

59
00:02:27,260 --> 00:02:28,260
 I really enjoyed it.

60
00:02:28,260 --> 00:02:30,220
 - And I actually had other options,

61
00:02:30,220 --> 00:02:32,340
 I had other options of ways to introduce that headline.

62
00:02:32,340 --> 00:02:34,740
 I went with that basic, really simple one.

63
00:02:34,740 --> 00:02:36,820
 But I was gonna say something like,

64
00:02:36,820 --> 00:02:41,460
 washing, removing stains, moving buildings.

65
00:02:41,460 --> 00:02:43,700
 Just three of the hats soap wears.

66
00:02:43,700 --> 00:02:45,980
 That's what I was gonna go with,

67
00:02:45,980 --> 00:02:47,860
 but it's the first fact, keep it simple.

68
00:02:47,860 --> 00:02:49,300
 But just so you know, I had that in the locker.

69
00:02:49,300 --> 00:02:50,700
 - No, no, no, absolutely.

70
00:02:50,700 --> 00:02:51,780
 I think you played it right though.

71
00:02:51,780 --> 00:02:53,180
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

72
00:02:53,180 --> 00:02:54,420
 - Yeah, so what's the story here then?

73
00:02:54,420 --> 00:02:56,860
 - So in Nova Scotia, at last,

74
00:02:56,860 --> 00:02:59,940
 I felt very local news this story.

75
00:02:59,940 --> 00:03:02,260
 So, and there was like a local news video about it.

76
00:03:02,260 --> 00:03:05,580
 But basically, an old Victorian building

77
00:03:05,580 --> 00:03:09,700
 that was mostly used as a hotel for about a hundred years.

78
00:03:09,700 --> 00:03:10,700
 It was gonna get knocked down.

79
00:03:10,700 --> 00:03:12,900
 Then a company bought it because they wanted to attach it

80
00:03:12,900 --> 00:03:15,820
 to a planned apartment block, sort of 30 feet away.

81
00:03:15,820 --> 00:03:19,380
 And instead of moving it the traditional way with rollers,

82
00:03:19,380 --> 00:03:22,180
 they used 700 bars of ivory soap,

83
00:03:22,180 --> 00:03:23,500
 because that's the softest soap.

84
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:24,980
 And therefore, the slippiest.

85
00:03:24,980 --> 00:03:25,820
 - All right.

86
00:03:25,820 --> 00:03:26,940
 - And they did that successfully

87
00:03:26,940 --> 00:03:28,380
 to then get it onto new foundations.

88
00:03:28,380 --> 00:03:29,580
 And then once that is complete,

89
00:03:29,580 --> 00:03:32,060
 they are going to move the whole thing back.

90
00:03:32,060 --> 00:03:32,900
 - What?

91
00:03:32,900 --> 00:03:33,720
 - Yeah, yeah.

92
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:34,540
 - Why?

93
00:03:34,540 --> 00:03:35,380
 - That's the end, I don't know.

94
00:03:35,380 --> 00:03:36,220
 They're gonna move, 'cause basically it's now,

95
00:03:36,220 --> 00:03:38,740
 it's like a protected landmark of this old building, I think.

96
00:03:38,740 --> 00:03:41,220
 And so, they were gonna restore the whole thing

97
00:03:41,220 --> 00:03:42,460
 and put it back to where it was,

98
00:03:42,460 --> 00:03:44,940
 which to me just suggests you wanted to move it with soap.

99
00:03:44,940 --> 00:03:45,940
 You didn't need to move this.

100
00:03:45,940 --> 00:03:47,300
 - Yeah, if it's protected,

101
00:03:47,300 --> 00:03:51,300
 but we've also proved beyond doubt that it's mobile,

102
00:03:51,300 --> 00:03:53,520
 it doesn't matter where it is as long as we're protecting it.

103
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:54,360
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

104
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:55,200
 - Taking it on the road.

105
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:56,740
 (all laughing)

106
00:03:56,740 --> 00:03:59,620
 - I found it amazing how little soap you need to move.

107
00:03:59,620 --> 00:04:01,540
 I mean, I looked at the photo, this is a big building.

108
00:04:01,540 --> 00:04:04,500
 700 bars of soap, it's obviously lots of bars of soap,

109
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:05,500
 but it's not that many windows.

110
00:04:05,500 --> 00:04:06,860
 - Surface area wise, it doesn't feel like a lot.

111
00:04:06,860 --> 00:04:07,700
 - Right.

112
00:04:07,700 --> 00:04:09,340
 - Well, they didn't even use 700 bars.

113
00:04:09,340 --> 00:04:10,180
 - Oh, really?

114
00:04:10,180 --> 00:04:11,340
 - Yeah, they took some home, didn't they?

115
00:04:11,340 --> 00:04:12,860
 I think some of the builders took,

116
00:04:12,860 --> 00:04:14,820
 there was 20 to 40 bars left.

117
00:04:14,820 --> 00:04:17,780
 So they used most of it, they estimated quite well.

118
00:04:17,780 --> 00:04:18,620
 - Yeah, no, but I mean--

119
00:04:18,620 --> 00:04:19,460
 - At last.

120
00:04:19,460 --> 00:04:22,480
 - Oh my gosh, I'm gonna hear that a lot.

121
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:24,540
 - The crazy thing is, this is not the first time

122
00:04:24,540 --> 00:04:26,500
 that soap's been used to move buildings,

123
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:29,580
 but it's clearly an essential ingredient

124
00:04:29,580 --> 00:04:31,220
 as part of the process of what they're doing,

125
00:04:31,220 --> 00:04:32,940
 and it was as they were getting ready to move it,

126
00:04:32,940 --> 00:04:35,020
 that's they went, we don't have any soap.

127
00:04:35,020 --> 00:04:36,940
 So it's not even like they bought it

128
00:04:36,940 --> 00:04:38,540
 in industrial bulk amounts.

129
00:04:38,540 --> 00:04:40,580
 What ended up happening was the guy who was in charge of it,

130
00:04:40,580 --> 00:04:43,460
 his wife, Leanne, had to run to 15 shops

131
00:04:43,460 --> 00:04:47,540
 around the area, and by using 970 something bucks,

132
00:04:47,540 --> 00:04:50,180
 the equivalent of 700 parts of soap.

133
00:04:50,180 --> 00:04:51,020
 - When you put it like that,

134
00:04:51,020 --> 00:04:53,020
 it suddenly sounds quite taskmaster, doesn't it?

135
00:04:53,020 --> 00:04:56,260
 It's like there's a panning there of like, oh my God.

136
00:04:56,260 --> 00:04:58,820
 - And he wasn't, this guy, Sheldon Rushden,

137
00:04:58,820 --> 00:05:02,940
 the lead builder guy, said, I think he said at first,

138
00:05:02,940 --> 00:05:04,980
 he thought, I'll just ask my wife

139
00:05:04,980 --> 00:05:06,980
 if we can use some of our soap from home,

140
00:05:06,980 --> 00:05:08,420
 and it was only when she said,

141
00:05:08,420 --> 00:05:09,860
 we're absolutely not doing that,

142
00:05:09,860 --> 00:05:11,620
 I'm not giving up our personal supply

143
00:05:11,620 --> 00:05:13,060
 that she offered to drive around,

144
00:05:13,060 --> 00:05:15,100
 which made me think, how many bars of soap

145
00:05:15,100 --> 00:05:16,860
 are you stoppiling in your house?

146
00:05:16,860 --> 00:05:17,700
 - Yeah, exactly.

147
00:05:17,700 --> 00:05:19,700
 - But also, how precious are you

148
00:05:19,700 --> 00:05:22,020
 about where the soap is your personal supply or not?

149
00:05:22,020 --> 00:05:23,020
 - Exactly.

150
00:05:23,020 --> 00:05:24,140
 - Sorry, surely, if it was like,

151
00:05:24,140 --> 00:05:25,460
 yeah, you can use some of our old soap,

152
00:05:25,460 --> 00:05:28,460
 but use some of the budget to get us some new soap.

153
00:05:28,460 --> 00:05:29,580
 Surely the same thing.

154
00:05:29,580 --> 00:05:31,460
 - You're right, as you've written diary entries

155
00:05:31,460 --> 00:05:32,700
 on the wrapping. - Yeah, it's got sentimental value,

156
00:05:32,700 --> 00:05:33,900
 her own personal or soap.

157
00:05:33,900 --> 00:05:35,660
 - I think once you're mixing work with pleasure,

158
00:05:35,660 --> 00:05:36,500
 it's sort of...

159
00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:38,540
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

160
00:05:38,540 --> 00:05:41,300
 - And it's, we are not meant,

161
00:05:41,300 --> 00:05:43,380
 we're not actually sponsored by Ivory Soap this week,

162
00:05:43,380 --> 00:05:46,220
 but it is very, very soft apparently, and that's great.

163
00:05:46,220 --> 00:05:48,780
 - So, and if you do use the offer code fish,

164
00:05:48,780 --> 00:05:50,500
 you are gonna get 20% off all of it.

165
00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:52,140
 - You'll get nothing, you'll get absolutely nothing.

166
00:05:52,140 --> 00:05:53,780
 You'll get a weird look.

167
00:05:53,780 --> 00:05:56,620
 But, so what the basic method you use

168
00:05:56,620 --> 00:05:58,180
 to move the building is,

169
00:05:58,180 --> 00:05:59,540
 so you dig under the building, don't you,

170
00:05:59,540 --> 00:06:02,020
 and then you put steel beams under the building,

171
00:06:02,020 --> 00:06:05,060
 then you lift the whole thing up by one inch

172
00:06:05,060 --> 00:06:07,820
 on hydraulic jacks, just jack it up one inch,

173
00:06:07,820 --> 00:06:10,580
 and you slide the soap underneath it on trays,

174
00:06:10,580 --> 00:06:13,660
 and then I think you lower, then you lower an inch,

175
00:06:13,660 --> 00:06:15,420
 and it just kind of squishes the soap,

176
00:06:15,420 --> 00:06:17,140
 but it's incredibly soapy now.

177
00:06:17,140 --> 00:06:19,620
 - Yeah, so you leave it overnight to squish the soap, right?

178
00:06:19,620 --> 00:06:21,020
 You sit it on the soap overnight,

179
00:06:21,020 --> 00:06:22,620
 which I feel like the building's heavy enough

180
00:06:22,620 --> 00:06:25,660
 that you only need to sit it on the soap for 10 minutes.

181
00:06:25,660 --> 00:06:26,740
 - These guys are experts, haven't they?

182
00:06:26,740 --> 00:06:27,740
 - They know what they're doing.

183
00:06:27,740 --> 00:06:28,860
 - And then what, you're trying to create

184
00:06:28,860 --> 00:06:31,180
 a sort of slip and slide aspect to it.

185
00:06:31,180 --> 00:06:32,620
 I bet they can just push it,

186
00:06:32,620 --> 00:06:33,940
 and it's just about the weight you push it,

187
00:06:33,940 --> 00:06:34,980
 where it's like curling.

188
00:06:34,980 --> 00:06:36,540
 And then it just doesn't land in the bit

189
00:06:36,540 --> 00:06:38,620
 you want the building to be, and eventually it's like,

190
00:06:38,620 --> 00:06:41,020
 nah, I squished it too hard, it's gone in the sea!

191
00:06:41,020 --> 00:06:43,820
 - It's a thousand of them with brooms created.

192
00:06:43,820 --> 00:06:45,620
 - Have any of you curled?

193
00:06:45,620 --> 00:06:46,460
 - Never.

194
00:06:46,460 --> 00:06:48,540
 - I've curled, I've curled, I've curled.

195
00:06:48,540 --> 00:06:50,140
 Sorry, but I curl.

196
00:06:50,140 --> 00:06:53,660
 I was trained by the British Olympic curling duo

197
00:06:53,660 --> 00:06:55,140
 for the Winter Olympics just gone.

198
00:06:55,140 --> 00:06:55,980
 - Yeah, clung?

199
00:06:55,980 --> 00:06:57,140
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah, old big time.

200
00:06:57,140 --> 00:07:00,020
 Whose names are, and then just insert them,

201
00:07:00,020 --> 00:07:00,860
 if you want to.

202
00:07:00,860 --> 00:07:03,600
 (laughing)

203
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:04,580
 They were lovely.

204
00:07:04,580 --> 00:07:07,900
 - Why were you hoping to be the third member of the team?

205
00:07:07,900 --> 00:07:11,220
 - Yeah, I did, I think, four team GBs, like YouTube thing,

206
00:07:11,220 --> 00:07:13,660
 I went and had to do four Winter Olympic sports,

207
00:07:13,660 --> 00:07:15,420
 because in the Summer Olympic podcast,

208
00:07:15,420 --> 00:07:17,700
 I had said, as a joke,

209
00:07:17,700 --> 00:07:20,220
 I reckon I could master any Olympic sport in a day.

210
00:07:20,220 --> 00:07:21,060
 - Right.

211
00:07:21,060 --> 00:07:23,100
 - And I was just, you know, I was being hyperbolic,

212
00:07:23,100 --> 00:07:25,140
 and then suddenly their next series I said, go on then,

213
00:07:25,140 --> 00:07:27,580
 and I mastered none of them in several days.

214
00:07:27,580 --> 00:07:29,140
 One of them's curling though, which was the easiest,

215
00:07:29,140 --> 00:07:30,620
 but it's like insane at first,

216
00:07:30,620 --> 00:07:32,780
 because also they're not very technical with their language,

217
00:07:32,780 --> 00:07:34,820
 so they literally just call it grippy shoe and slippy shoe,

218
00:07:34,820 --> 00:07:36,140
 and you have one of these.

219
00:07:36,140 --> 00:07:37,140
 - Oh, that's like bowling.

220
00:07:37,140 --> 00:07:38,980
 - Yeah, right, right, right.

221
00:07:38,980 --> 00:07:40,260
 - You're basically in the slippy, yeah, yeah.

222
00:07:40,260 --> 00:07:41,900
 - So you have, they gave me like this thing

223
00:07:41,900 --> 00:07:44,220
 that goes under your shin as you slide along at first.

224
00:07:44,220 --> 00:07:47,220
 It's basically like a little ice skate, but it just rests.

225
00:07:47,220 --> 00:07:48,660
 I think you just have that at first,

226
00:07:48,660 --> 00:07:51,580
 and then you're supposed to just slide on your actual shin.

227
00:07:51,580 --> 00:07:52,580
 But they give you that at first,

228
00:07:52,580 --> 00:07:54,860
 that's like barriers in bowling, I reckon.

229
00:07:54,860 --> 00:07:57,060
 Or like the thing you push the ball down to make in.

230
00:07:57,060 --> 00:07:58,180
 - I see, I see.

231
00:07:58,180 --> 00:07:59,580
 How did you do?

232
00:07:59,580 --> 00:08:00,940
 - Pretty badly, I think.

233
00:08:00,940 --> 00:08:02,700
 But it was better than when I had to do speed skating

234
00:08:02,700 --> 00:08:05,940
 and smashed open my chin on the last shot of the whole thing.

235
00:08:05,940 --> 00:08:06,780
 - Oh, wow.

236
00:08:06,780 --> 00:08:08,420
 - Yeah, that was much worse.

237
00:08:08,420 --> 00:08:10,500
 - They should have given you a little ski

238
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:12,060
 for the bottom of your chin.

239
00:08:12,060 --> 00:08:14,940
 Like you'll need a curling for that situation.

240
00:08:14,940 --> 00:08:17,300
 - We just come in today dressed fully in skis, by the way.

241
00:08:17,300 --> 00:08:19,060
 Head to toe, skis for every limb.

242
00:08:19,060 --> 00:08:21,020
 - Well, the only issue with the idea with this building

243
00:08:21,020 --> 00:08:23,460
 being the curling system is you could probably get it

244
00:08:23,460 --> 00:08:24,780
 into place with one big push,

245
00:08:24,780 --> 00:08:26,860
 but then you might have a rival building behind you

246
00:08:26,860 --> 00:08:29,820
 knock you out using the same system.

247
00:08:29,820 --> 00:08:33,500
 - You know, the Titanic was put on soap.

248
00:08:33,500 --> 00:08:36,140
 I think we've said before that the Titanic was put on soap

249
00:08:36,140 --> 00:08:38,700
 to go down the slipway, to get in like the whale blubber

250
00:08:38,700 --> 00:08:39,540
 and all that sort of stuff.

251
00:08:39,540 --> 00:08:41,700
 - Yeah, it was tallow and oil and soap,

252
00:08:41,700 --> 00:08:44,340
 and it was 20 tons of it that was used.

253
00:08:44,340 --> 00:08:45,700
 It was kind of amazing, but obviously.

254
00:08:45,700 --> 00:08:47,180
 - That's more than 700 bars, isn't it?

255
00:08:47,180 --> 00:08:48,020
 - Yeah.

256
00:08:48,020 --> 00:08:49,980
 - But I did, so I was just reading a bit more about that.

257
00:08:49,980 --> 00:08:51,060
 I'd never read this before,

258
00:08:51,060 --> 00:08:52,860
 that workers, they would go to the slipway afterwards

259
00:08:52,860 --> 00:08:55,420
 and try and gather up any spare soap that was left over.

260
00:08:55,420 --> 00:08:56,620
 - Oh, to use themselves.

261
00:08:56,620 --> 00:08:57,460
 - Interesting.

262
00:08:57,460 --> 00:09:00,420
 - But it was also covered in sort of oil and--

263
00:09:00,420 --> 00:09:01,620
 - You could probably wash it, right?

264
00:09:01,620 --> 00:09:03,300
 You could probably rush away that,

265
00:09:03,300 --> 00:09:05,060
 and then you've got the soap sitting underneath.

266
00:09:05,060 --> 00:09:05,900
 - I guess so.

267
00:09:05,900 --> 00:09:07,900
 - Yeah, I don't think soap gets,

268
00:09:07,900 --> 00:09:09,820
 'cause you can just wash off the upper layer.

269
00:09:09,820 --> 00:09:10,700
 - There is a big debate online

270
00:09:10,700 --> 00:09:12,580
 about whether you can get soap dirty.

271
00:09:12,580 --> 00:09:14,980
 (laughing)

272
00:09:14,980 --> 00:09:15,820
 - Welcome to the show.

273
00:09:15,820 --> 00:09:16,660
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

274
00:09:16,660 --> 00:09:19,060
 - This is the kind of controversy we try on the way.

275
00:09:19,060 --> 00:09:20,740
 - Of course you can, of course you can.

276
00:09:20,740 --> 00:09:22,900
 I'm willing to weigh in on this debate.

277
00:09:22,900 --> 00:09:24,180
 Of course you can get soap, are you mad?

278
00:09:24,180 --> 00:09:25,020
 Of course you can get soap dirty.

279
00:09:25,020 --> 00:09:26,700
 - I believe, of course you can get soap dirty,

280
00:09:26,700 --> 00:09:28,540
 but it doesn't stop it cleaning you.

281
00:09:28,540 --> 00:09:29,380
 So it doesn't matter.

282
00:09:29,380 --> 00:09:30,220
 - Interesting.

283
00:09:30,220 --> 00:09:31,040
 - If you're soap's dirty,

284
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:31,880
 it doesn't make a difference.

285
00:09:31,880 --> 00:09:32,720
 - Yeah, the level of dirty,

286
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:35,740
 it would have to be for the dirt on it to make you dirtier.

287
00:09:35,740 --> 00:09:36,580
 - Yeah.

288
00:09:36,580 --> 00:09:38,980
 - That way the cleanliness of the soap being applied to you

289
00:09:38,980 --> 00:09:40,140
 is so dirty.

290
00:09:40,140 --> 00:09:40,980
 - Yeah.

291
00:09:40,980 --> 00:09:42,460
 - But you're at that point right off that bar of soap.

292
00:09:42,460 --> 00:09:43,900
 - Sometimes in horrible pubs,

293
00:09:43,900 --> 00:09:47,140
 there will be a bar of soap at the sinks.

294
00:09:47,140 --> 00:09:47,980
 And you look at it and you think,

295
00:09:47,980 --> 00:09:49,620
 oh, I'm actually, I'm not sure.

296
00:09:49,620 --> 00:09:50,700
 - Well, this is a thing.

297
00:09:50,700 --> 00:09:52,940
 There was a report that was done,

298
00:09:52,940 --> 00:09:54,940
 a sort of a research project to look into

299
00:09:54,940 --> 00:09:58,660
 how clean actually are in bathrooms like pubs and stuff.

300
00:09:58,660 --> 00:09:59,900
 How clean is the soap that you're getting?

301
00:09:59,900 --> 00:10:01,800
 And they've worked out that some of the dispensers

302
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:03,180
 are left for so long,

303
00:10:03,180 --> 00:10:05,340
 where they're not maintained and they get cracks in it,

304
00:10:05,340 --> 00:10:08,700
 that you can go to the toilet, wash your hands with the soap

305
00:10:08,700 --> 00:10:10,420
 and leave with dirtier hands,

306
00:10:10,420 --> 00:10:11,540
 then you arrived with,

307
00:10:11,540 --> 00:10:13,860
 yeah, because they found 15 types of bacteria

308
00:10:13,860 --> 00:10:16,140
 that were sitting on these dispensers

309
00:10:16,140 --> 00:10:18,460
 that would make it onto your hand as part of the soap.

310
00:10:18,460 --> 00:10:19,300
 - Right.

311
00:10:19,300 --> 00:10:20,140
 - And, yeah.

312
00:10:20,140 --> 00:10:22,700
 - Yeah, same pull handles in the toilet,

313
00:10:22,700 --> 00:10:25,620
 when you think, I know what people are doing in here.

314
00:10:25,620 --> 00:10:28,500
 - I'm gonna make a call on this toilet thing

315
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:30,660
 and say it doesn't make your hands dirtier

316
00:10:30,660 --> 00:10:31,500
 than after you wash them.

317
00:10:31,500 --> 00:10:33,020
 'Cause it doesn't matter if there's bacteria

318
00:10:33,020 --> 00:10:33,860
 on the soap dispenser,

319
00:10:33,860 --> 00:10:35,620
 on the soap dispenser, it does matter.

320
00:10:35,620 --> 00:10:36,460
 - Well, yeah.

321
00:10:36,460 --> 00:10:37,380
 - Don't even see it.

322
00:10:37,380 --> 00:10:38,820
 But on the soap dispenser,

323
00:10:38,820 --> 00:10:40,660
 isn't the point of soap that it gets onto your hands

324
00:10:40,660 --> 00:10:43,740
 and then it makes the water and the dirt on your hands

325
00:10:43,740 --> 00:10:45,340
 more slippery and so it gets them off

326
00:10:45,340 --> 00:10:47,300
 and it doesn't matter if there's bacteria on the dispenser.

327
00:10:47,300 --> 00:10:48,140
 - Yes, it does.

328
00:10:48,140 --> 00:10:49,940
 - The soap immediately gets all of that off.

329
00:10:49,940 --> 00:10:50,940
 So, which is why it doesn't matter

330
00:10:50,940 --> 00:10:52,180
 if a bar of soap is dirty.

331
00:10:52,180 --> 00:10:53,580
 - No, but that's the amazing thing about soap

332
00:10:53,580 --> 00:10:55,380
 and it's why it's so incredible that we,

333
00:10:55,380 --> 00:10:59,220
 you know, as a species discovered it millennia ago,

334
00:10:59,220 --> 00:11:02,500
 it not only makes the dirt and stuff on your hands slippery

335
00:11:02,500 --> 00:11:05,740
 to slide off, but it also has this structure

336
00:11:05,740 --> 00:11:08,820
 which tears open bacteria and viruses.

337
00:11:08,820 --> 00:11:09,660
 It's amazing.

338
00:11:09,660 --> 00:11:10,480
 - Yeah.

339
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:12,580
 - Like it's, okay, I just, so I want to read this

340
00:11:12,580 --> 00:11:13,860
 'cause I don't want to get it wrong.

341
00:11:13,860 --> 00:11:16,460
 Each molecule of soap has a head which bonds with water

342
00:11:16,460 --> 00:11:18,340
 and then a tail which hates water, right?

343
00:11:18,340 --> 00:11:20,580
 So, and sort of it's hydrophobic, you know,

344
00:11:20,580 --> 00:11:22,220
 and tries to avoid it at all costs.

345
00:11:22,220 --> 00:11:23,620
 - That's horrible identity crisis.

346
00:11:23,620 --> 00:11:24,460
 - I know, I know, I know.

347
00:11:24,460 --> 00:11:25,300
 - It must.

348
00:11:25,300 --> 00:11:26,140
 - It's poor molecule.

349
00:11:26,140 --> 00:11:29,060
 - And so the tail seeks oils and fats and things.

350
00:11:29,060 --> 00:11:31,300
 And basically, bacteria and viruses,

351
00:11:31,300 --> 00:11:34,100
 they're surrounded by a lipid membrane, a fatty membrane.

352
00:11:34,100 --> 00:11:36,980
 And when they touch soap, the soap kind of envelops it

353
00:11:36,980 --> 00:11:38,700
 and also the soap molecule tails,

354
00:11:38,700 --> 00:11:40,300
 which are trying to avoid water,

355
00:11:40,300 --> 00:11:42,700
 realize there is a fatty layer on that bacterium

356
00:11:42,700 --> 00:11:45,540
 and burrow into it, they sort of wedge themselves in

357
00:11:45,540 --> 00:11:47,420
 and that reps the bacterium apart.

358
00:11:47,420 --> 00:11:49,300
 So that's the other thing that's going on

359
00:11:49,300 --> 00:11:50,620
 as well as making things slippier.

360
00:11:50,620 --> 00:11:51,460
 - Yeah.

361
00:11:51,460 --> 00:11:52,300
 - It's just amazing.

362
00:11:52,300 --> 00:11:53,140
 - It's incredible.

363
00:11:53,140 --> 00:11:54,460
 - And it smells nice.

364
00:11:54,460 --> 00:11:55,300
 - It smells nice.

365
00:11:55,300 --> 00:11:56,300
 - Lest we forget.

366
00:11:56,300 --> 00:11:57,140
 - Naturally.

367
00:11:57,140 --> 00:11:58,780
 - That was the main comment of the builders

368
00:11:58,780 --> 00:12:00,140
 after they moved that building.

369
00:12:00,140 --> 00:12:00,980
 - And it smelled nice.

370
00:12:00,980 --> 00:12:02,660
 - Honestly, they said they went away smelling great.

371
00:12:02,660 --> 00:12:03,500
 - Yeah, yeah.

372
00:12:03,500 --> 00:12:04,340
 - Yeah.

373
00:12:04,340 --> 00:12:09,020
 - Do you know though, what is better out of,

374
00:12:09,020 --> 00:12:10,860
 I feel like I've presented this in a really obvious way now,

375
00:12:10,860 --> 00:12:13,780
 out of antibacterial soap and just a bar of soap.

376
00:12:13,780 --> 00:12:15,180
 - Anti-bacterial.

377
00:12:15,180 --> 00:12:16,540
 - Dan, you idiot.

378
00:12:16,540 --> 00:12:19,420
 I mean, I even said it, so the answer was clear.

379
00:12:19,420 --> 00:12:21,340
 No, there's a serious worry that people are converting

380
00:12:21,340 --> 00:12:24,180
 to antibacterial soap a lot and hand soap.

381
00:12:24,180 --> 00:12:26,220
 And there's a guy called Professor Lithko,

382
00:12:26,220 --> 00:12:28,940
 who works at Monash University in Australia.

383
00:12:28,940 --> 00:12:31,780
 And he says that he thinks they should all be banned

384
00:12:31,780 --> 00:12:34,500
 antimicrobial soaps because they're not better

385
00:12:34,500 --> 00:12:36,460
 than just a bar of soap, even though we,

386
00:12:36,460 --> 00:12:37,900
 I mean, we've got them all over our house now.

387
00:12:37,900 --> 00:12:39,660
 There's a COVID hangover.

388
00:12:39,660 --> 00:12:40,900
 Not better than a bar of soap.

389
00:12:40,900 --> 00:12:42,860
 Hand soap is why you don't use water,

390
00:12:42,860 --> 00:12:45,540
 are significantly less good because, you know,

391
00:12:45,540 --> 00:12:48,580
 when you get a hand sanitizer, that's a lot less good.

392
00:12:48,580 --> 00:12:49,420
 - Yeah, is it?

393
00:12:49,420 --> 00:12:50,660
 - Yeah, 'cause the water doesn't,

394
00:12:50,660 --> 00:12:54,500
 you need the water to scrub away and wash off that layer.

395
00:12:54,500 --> 00:12:57,700
 And he says that they're causing a huge amount

396
00:12:57,700 --> 00:13:02,100
 of antibiotic resistance because we're shoving

397
00:13:02,100 --> 00:13:04,020
 this antibacterial soap at our hands

398
00:13:04,020 --> 00:13:05,900
 and all the bacteria is becoming kind of superbugs

399
00:13:05,900 --> 00:13:06,740
 on our hands.

400
00:13:06,740 --> 00:13:07,580
 - Yes.

401
00:13:07,580 --> 00:13:08,820
 - And he explains. - They're attracting.

402
00:13:08,820 --> 00:13:10,100
 - Exactly, we're all gonna have

403
00:13:10,100 --> 00:13:12,260
 just these superbugs living on us.

404
00:13:12,260 --> 00:13:14,420
 So really, and this really surprised me,

405
00:13:14,420 --> 00:13:18,020
 it's not about the antimicrobial chemical properties,

406
00:13:18,020 --> 00:13:20,260
 really, as much as it is about the scrub.

407
00:13:20,260 --> 00:13:22,340
 But actually, the key is, as long as you scrub

408
00:13:22,340 --> 00:13:25,460
 your hands really hard with the water, it scrapes them off.

409
00:13:25,460 --> 00:13:26,460
 - And with the soap?

410
00:13:26,460 --> 00:13:27,300
 - And with the soap.

411
00:13:27,300 --> 00:13:28,820
 - It does, all right, but soap is the thing, really.

412
00:13:28,820 --> 00:13:30,380
 - But yes, there's definitely something psychological

413
00:13:30,380 --> 00:13:33,140
 about the smell and presentation, though, right,

414
00:13:33,140 --> 00:13:36,420
 of how clean you feel, 'cause natural soaps don't feel,

415
00:13:36,420 --> 00:13:38,140
 they obviously are better, and you could make soap

416
00:13:38,140 --> 00:13:41,220
 out of just oil and lard, basically, can't you?

417
00:13:41,220 --> 00:13:42,340
 - Yeah, yeah.

418
00:13:42,340 --> 00:13:44,140
 - You know, I find rubbing oil on my body,

419
00:13:44,140 --> 00:13:45,780
 I don't feel, and lard,

420
00:13:45,780 --> 00:13:46,620
 - It's lime, isn't it?

421
00:13:46,620 --> 00:13:47,460
 - It's being massively clean.

422
00:13:47,460 --> 00:13:48,900
 And they're saying it's like that,

423
00:13:48,900 --> 00:13:51,300
 and the scrub of that is what actually makes you clean.

424
00:13:51,300 --> 00:13:52,780
 - Why am I getting so turned on?

425
00:13:52,780 --> 00:13:53,620
 - I need it.

426
00:13:53,620 --> 00:13:54,460
 (laughing)

427
00:13:54,460 --> 00:13:58,780
 - Well, I shouldn't be rubbing myself, but you need,

428
00:13:58,780 --> 00:14:01,420
 I need, it has to have a scent, or I won't feel.

429
00:14:01,420 --> 00:14:02,260
 - It does it.

430
00:14:02,260 --> 00:14:05,820
 - Well, also, I've not used a bar of soap for years,

431
00:14:05,820 --> 00:14:07,460
 and I find a bar of soap disgusting.

432
00:14:07,460 --> 00:14:09,860
 - Haven't you, I always only use bars.

433
00:14:09,860 --> 00:14:11,300
 - Never a bar, never a bar.

434
00:14:11,300 --> 00:14:12,140
 Come on.

435
00:14:12,140 --> 00:14:12,980
 - I don't mind a bar of soap.

436
00:14:12,980 --> 00:14:13,820
 - Are you a cartoon?

437
00:14:13,820 --> 00:14:14,660
 Are you all cartoon?

438
00:14:14,660 --> 00:14:15,500
 (laughing)

439
00:14:15,500 --> 00:14:16,340
 - What do you do?

440
00:14:16,340 --> 00:14:20,060
 - I don't use, in our house, we have the, yeah,

441
00:14:20,060 --> 00:14:22,540
 we have liquid soap as opposed to a bar of soap.

442
00:14:22,540 --> 00:14:24,980
 - Yeah, we pump a little pump,

443
00:14:24,980 --> 00:14:26,980
 and I like a shower or gel type situation.

444
00:14:26,980 --> 00:14:27,820
 - I've never heard of pump soap.

445
00:14:27,820 --> 00:14:28,660
 I'm familiar with the concept,

446
00:14:28,660 --> 00:14:31,100
 but you should just feel very guilty,

447
00:14:31,100 --> 00:14:33,660
 because of course, you are single-handedly destroying

448
00:14:33,660 --> 00:14:35,180
 the world with all of your plastics.

449
00:14:35,180 --> 00:14:36,620
 - No palm oil, always say no palm oil, please.

450
00:14:36,620 --> 00:14:38,260
 What, it's the issue of plastic?

451
00:14:38,260 --> 00:14:40,540
 - Yeah, plastic, is it around?

452
00:14:40,540 --> 00:14:41,980
 - Right, who are you saying it to?

453
00:14:41,980 --> 00:14:43,500
 Are you saying your personal soap?

454
00:14:43,500 --> 00:14:44,820
 - No palm oil, please.

455
00:14:44,820 --> 00:14:47,900
 - To my bottom, sorry, I don't make that clear.

456
00:14:47,900 --> 00:14:50,140
 (laughing)

457
00:14:51,780 --> 00:14:54,700
 Most soaps, again, I actually haven't bought bar in ages.

458
00:14:54,700 --> 00:14:58,180
 Aren't they covered in quite a plastic-y kind of wrapping?

459
00:14:58,180 --> 00:14:59,020
 - Yes, Dan, but--

460
00:14:59,020 --> 00:14:59,860
 - Paper, but--

461
00:14:59,860 --> 00:15:00,700
 - Is it paper these days?

462
00:15:00,700 --> 00:15:01,540
 (laughing)

463
00:15:01,540 --> 00:15:03,900
 - Okay, there's a, right, there is a spectrum,

464
00:15:03,900 --> 00:15:05,580
 what we see is a spectrum is here,

465
00:15:05,580 --> 00:15:08,260
 from Anna, who is this only old-fashioned bar of soap

466
00:15:08,260 --> 00:15:09,980
 that have to be cut from the mother block,

467
00:15:09,980 --> 00:15:13,020
 and then wrapped in cruise-proof paper.

468
00:15:13,020 --> 00:15:15,360
 (laughing)

469
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:18,900
 Up to Dan, who has like those auto dispensers

470
00:15:18,900 --> 00:15:20,140
 at every doorway in his house.

471
00:15:20,140 --> 00:15:21,740
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

472
00:15:21,740 --> 00:15:24,740
 - So, the other board, this is such a good thing to say,

473
00:15:24,740 --> 00:15:27,220
 but actually, if you use bar soap,

474
00:15:27,220 --> 00:15:28,980
 it's got a slightly lower carbon footprint

475
00:15:28,980 --> 00:15:30,380
 than the travel emissions,

476
00:15:30,380 --> 00:15:31,740
 'cause you're not, you know, with liquid soap,

477
00:15:31,740 --> 00:15:34,260
 you're mostly transporting the water.

478
00:15:34,260 --> 00:15:36,180
 - Yeah, but what about, okay,

479
00:15:36,180 --> 00:15:38,740
 but what about the satisfaction of a foam burst?

480
00:15:38,740 --> 00:15:39,820
 You ever used a foam burst?

481
00:15:39,820 --> 00:15:41,540
 I've, okay, briefly obsessed with foam bursts.

482
00:15:41,540 --> 00:15:42,380
 - What is a foam burst?

483
00:15:42,380 --> 00:15:43,900
 - It's just a soap that is literally designed

484
00:15:43,900 --> 00:15:46,580
 to become extra foamy when you're lathering,

485
00:15:46,580 --> 00:15:48,980
 and so, you know, you feel, it's exciting.

486
00:15:48,980 --> 00:15:51,260
 - It's very exciting, where to start or end your day.

487
00:15:51,260 --> 00:15:52,780
 - Just, feels like you're not engaging

488
00:15:52,780 --> 00:15:54,340
 with the ethical issues here,

489
00:15:54,340 --> 00:15:56,680
 where you get very much set and foam based.

490
00:15:56,680 --> 00:15:58,260
 - Listen, and I'm happy with this girl record,

491
00:15:58,260 --> 00:16:00,580
 I couldn't give a fuck about the ethical issues at all.

492
00:16:00,580 --> 00:16:02,820
 (laughing)

493
00:16:02,820 --> 00:16:05,280
 I flew here.

494
00:16:05,280 --> 00:16:07,540
 (laughing)

495
00:16:07,540 --> 00:16:10,120
 (upbeat music)

496
00:16:10,120 --> 00:16:15,100
 - Okay, it is time for fact number two,

497
00:16:15,100 --> 00:16:16,820
 and that is Andy.

498
00:16:16,820 --> 00:16:18,700
 - My fact is that the 19th century author,

499
00:16:18,700 --> 00:16:23,140
 Thomas Hardy, had two funerals at the same time.

500
00:16:23,140 --> 00:16:24,360
 - Did you say 19th century author,

501
00:16:24,360 --> 00:16:26,700
 so we didn't confuse him with the 21st century actor?

502
00:16:26,700 --> 00:16:27,780
 'Cause he's still alive.

503
00:16:27,780 --> 00:16:30,060
 - This is Tom Hardy, Thomas Hardy,

504
00:16:30,060 --> 00:16:32,300
 who wrote, I'm confusing it already,

505
00:16:32,300 --> 00:16:34,220
 Jude the Obscure, Tess of the Durbovilles,

506
00:16:34,220 --> 00:16:35,660
 Mayor of Castor Bridge.

507
00:16:35,660 --> 00:16:37,100
 - We don't need the full bibliography.

508
00:16:37,100 --> 00:16:39,580
 - About 900 poems, he was a big deal.

509
00:16:39,580 --> 00:16:40,420
 - He was.

510
00:16:40,420 --> 00:16:41,260
 - He was mega famous, actually.

511
00:16:41,260 --> 00:16:43,820
 And that was sort of what led to this problem, basically.

512
00:16:43,820 --> 00:16:46,020
 He was meant to be buried in Dorset

513
00:16:46,020 --> 00:16:49,980
 in his native Stinsford with his first wife, right?

514
00:16:49,980 --> 00:16:51,940
 And it was all ready to go.

515
00:16:51,940 --> 00:16:54,580
 There was a space on the tombstone for him,

516
00:16:54,580 --> 00:16:56,900
 his name to be added, you know?

517
00:16:56,900 --> 00:16:59,740
 And then he died, and then his friends,

518
00:16:59,740 --> 00:17:03,500
 including James Barry of Peter Pan fame,

519
00:17:03,500 --> 00:17:04,860
 and Sidney Cockrell,

520
00:17:04,860 --> 00:17:07,100
 who slightly less well-treated by history,

521
00:17:07,100 --> 00:17:08,980
 but you know, I'm sure a big deal at the time.

522
00:17:08,980 --> 00:17:10,340
 They went to his home basically on his death,

523
00:17:10,340 --> 00:17:12,420
 and they said, we think he should be buried

524
00:17:12,420 --> 00:17:13,860
 in Poets Corner in Westminster Abbey.

525
00:17:13,860 --> 00:17:16,140
 He's a huge, huge deal.

526
00:17:16,140 --> 00:17:20,060
 And they kind of bullied Thomas Hardy's second wife,

527
00:17:20,060 --> 00:17:22,060
 Florence, into going along with it, you know?

528
00:17:22,060 --> 00:17:22,900
 - Right.

529
00:17:22,900 --> 00:17:24,460
 - She sort of said, well, okay, fine.

530
00:17:24,460 --> 00:17:29,100
 So they struck a deal whereby he went to Poets Corner,

531
00:17:29,100 --> 00:17:31,460
 and his heart went to Stinsford.

532
00:17:31,460 --> 00:17:35,380
 And they both had a funeral at 2 p.m.

533
00:17:35,380 --> 00:17:38,220
 on the 16th of January, 1928, and that was the...

534
00:17:38,220 --> 00:17:40,940
 - I mean, real Sophie's choice for his second wife.

535
00:17:40,940 --> 00:17:42,860
 Sorry, you're either gonna be buried in Poets Corner,

536
00:17:42,860 --> 00:17:44,340
 which is not where he's supposed to be,

537
00:17:44,340 --> 00:17:47,300
 or with your other wife, your previous wife.

538
00:17:47,300 --> 00:17:49,820
 And, oh no, we'll just take your heart to your previous wife.

539
00:17:49,820 --> 00:17:51,020
 - I know, it's really...

540
00:17:51,020 --> 00:17:51,860
 - Where's your mother?

541
00:17:51,860 --> 00:17:53,020
 Where the fuck are you coming in all of this?

542
00:17:53,020 --> 00:17:53,860
 You can take a look.

543
00:17:53,860 --> 00:17:54,700
 - Where am I ending up?

544
00:17:54,700 --> 00:17:55,540
 - What?

545
00:17:55,540 --> 00:17:56,900
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

546
00:17:56,900 --> 00:17:57,740
 - It's true.

547
00:17:57,740 --> 00:18:00,660
 And also, like, well, I think reading into it more,

548
00:18:00,660 --> 00:18:02,300
 I think his family was there as well,

549
00:18:02,300 --> 00:18:03,780
 so that was kind of...

550
00:18:03,780 --> 00:18:04,620
 - Stinsford.

551
00:18:04,620 --> 00:18:05,460
 - Yeah, exactly.

552
00:18:05,460 --> 00:18:06,900
 Yeah, no, not Poets Corner.

553
00:18:06,900 --> 00:18:09,060
 (all laughing)

554
00:18:09,060 --> 00:18:11,500
 And so, because his wife, his first wife,

555
00:18:11,500 --> 00:18:13,380
 they didn't particularly get on too well,

556
00:18:13,380 --> 00:18:14,820
 like, deep into the marriage.

557
00:18:14,820 --> 00:18:16,980
 To begin with, they did, but there was a lot of...

558
00:18:16,980 --> 00:18:17,820
 - No, it was a...

559
00:18:17,820 --> 00:18:18,660
 - There's a painful marriage

560
00:18:18,660 --> 00:18:20,100
 according to a lot of the friends

561
00:18:20,100 --> 00:18:21,820
 and close relatives and so on.

562
00:18:21,820 --> 00:18:24,540
 - And her, herself, and him, himself.

563
00:18:24,540 --> 00:18:25,860
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

564
00:18:25,860 --> 00:18:28,540
 So why did he want to be there?

565
00:18:28,540 --> 00:18:29,860
 - Well, the family, I guess.

566
00:18:29,860 --> 00:18:31,060
 She just happened to be there.

567
00:18:31,060 --> 00:18:31,900
 - Right.

568
00:18:31,900 --> 00:18:33,740
 - I didn't know he felt huge regret

569
00:18:33,740 --> 00:18:36,340
 about what a dick he was to her, it was said.

570
00:18:36,340 --> 00:18:37,540
 He treated her quite bad.

571
00:18:37,540 --> 00:18:39,260
 She kept a book.

572
00:18:39,260 --> 00:18:40,100
 - Yes.

573
00:18:40,100 --> 00:18:41,740
 - That's the weirdest title I've ever heard.

574
00:18:41,740 --> 00:18:43,980
 - Yeah, so he found after she died,

575
00:18:43,980 --> 00:18:46,060
 and they did have this difficult relationship, didn't they?

576
00:18:46,060 --> 00:18:49,300
 And she's a very interesting, weird character.

577
00:18:49,300 --> 00:18:51,700
 But he found in the attic, after she died,

578
00:18:51,700 --> 00:18:53,860
 a diary that she'd written, basically called something like,

579
00:18:53,860 --> 00:18:55,580
 "What I Think of My Husband."

580
00:18:55,580 --> 00:18:56,420
 - Yeah, that's it.

581
00:18:56,420 --> 00:18:57,580
 - And just loads of bitching about him.

582
00:18:57,580 --> 00:19:00,020
 And he did, and he feels so awful.

583
00:19:00,020 --> 00:19:02,540
 And he felt really guilty reading that.

584
00:19:02,540 --> 00:19:03,820
 And I think he burned it, so we don't know.

585
00:19:03,820 --> 00:19:04,820
 - Immediately, yeah.

586
00:19:04,820 --> 00:19:06,660
 - Yeah, absolutely.

587
00:19:06,660 --> 00:19:07,500
 - I feel so bad about it.

588
00:19:07,500 --> 00:19:08,980
 Okay, let's just pop that in the fire.

589
00:19:08,980 --> 00:19:10,500
 - He burned it on the gaslight.

590
00:19:10,500 --> 00:19:11,420
 (laughing)

591
00:19:11,420 --> 00:19:13,260
 - I think that's Every Husband's Nightmare.

592
00:19:13,260 --> 00:19:14,100
 - Yeah, yeah.

593
00:19:14,100 --> 00:19:14,940
 - It's fine to go for it, yeah.

594
00:19:14,940 --> 00:19:16,780
 - It's titled that, oh my God.

595
00:19:16,780 --> 00:19:19,100
 - It's not a dream for every wife, I'm gonna tell you.

596
00:19:19,100 --> 00:19:20,180
 - You're not picking up a book called,

597
00:19:20,180 --> 00:19:21,140
 "What I Think of My Husband"

598
00:19:21,140 --> 00:19:23,540
 and expecting a positive review, are you?

599
00:19:23,540 --> 00:19:24,380
 - He's great!

600
00:19:24,380 --> 00:19:25,220
 - End of book.

601
00:19:25,220 --> 00:19:26,060
 - Oh dear.

602
00:19:26,060 --> 00:19:28,500
 - Always helps, he was listened.

603
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:29,580
 - She lived in the attic.

604
00:19:29,580 --> 00:19:31,380
 She just moved into the attic after a while.

605
00:19:31,380 --> 00:19:34,060
 A while after their relationship started to go really wrong.

606
00:19:34,060 --> 00:19:37,620
 She was kind of the, she was the sane woman in the attic.

607
00:19:37,620 --> 00:19:40,460
 - Well, I mean, sources differ on the sanity level, right?

608
00:19:40,460 --> 00:19:42,220
 - And then he remarried, he married Florence,

609
00:19:42,220 --> 00:19:44,380
 who was 39 years his junior.

610
00:19:44,380 --> 00:19:46,140
 There's a big difference, though.

611
00:19:46,140 --> 00:19:50,500
 - The list of, not even guests at the funeral of Thomas Hardy,

612
00:19:50,500 --> 00:19:52,060
 but the Paul Bearers.

613
00:19:52,060 --> 00:19:54,900
 You had, just before mentioned, James Barry,

614
00:19:54,900 --> 00:19:56,860
 J.M. Barry was one of the Paul Bearers.

615
00:19:56,860 --> 00:19:58,980
 You had George Bernard Shaw.

616
00:19:58,980 --> 00:20:01,700
 You had the Prime Minister, Stanley Baldwin,

617
00:20:01,700 --> 00:20:03,140
 as one of the Paul Bearers.

618
00:20:03,140 --> 00:20:05,260
 And then, you know, various other names

619
00:20:05,260 --> 00:20:06,220
 that were obviously massive.

620
00:20:06,220 --> 00:20:07,940
 - Two Prime Ministers being Paul Bearers,

621
00:20:07,940 --> 00:20:09,780
 but one of them wasn't Prime Minister yet.

622
00:20:09,780 --> 00:20:11,580
 - That's right, leader of the opposition at the time.

623
00:20:11,580 --> 00:20:14,260
 - Ramsay McDonald, who was then the first Labour Prime Minister.

624
00:20:14,260 --> 00:20:15,100
 Rudyard Kipling.

625
00:20:15,100 --> 00:20:15,940
 - And Kipling, yeah.

626
00:20:15,940 --> 00:20:16,780
 - Paul's the Paul Bearer.

627
00:20:16,780 --> 00:20:18,460
 - I mean, I guess, is this that surprising?

628
00:20:18,460 --> 00:20:19,900
 Like, if Richard Ellsman dies,

629
00:20:19,900 --> 00:20:21,500
 I wouldn't be massively surprised

630
00:20:21,500 --> 00:20:23,700
 if like Sebastian Folks, Ian McEwan.

631
00:20:23,700 --> 00:20:24,540
 - Yeah, but this is the equivalent

632
00:20:24,540 --> 00:20:27,020
 of Richard Sunak and Keir Starmer also turning up.

633
00:20:27,020 --> 00:20:28,420
 - I don't think you get a lot of volunteers

634
00:20:28,420 --> 00:20:30,220
 to carry that coffin.

635
00:20:30,220 --> 00:20:31,060
 He's a big lad.

636
00:20:31,060 --> 00:20:33,620
 - Oh yeah, your Paul Bearer list would be very long,

637
00:20:33,620 --> 00:20:34,460
 wouldn't it?

638
00:20:34,460 --> 00:20:35,300
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

639
00:20:35,300 --> 00:20:37,260
 - Paul McEwan's idea was 'cause he had 10.

640
00:20:37,260 --> 00:20:38,100
 - Did he?

641
00:20:38,100 --> 00:20:38,940
 - Which feels like a lot.

642
00:20:38,940 --> 00:20:39,760
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

643
00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:40,600
 - Normally you can fit six.

644
00:20:40,600 --> 00:20:41,440
 - Yeah, good point.

645
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:42,280
 - You know.

646
00:20:42,280 --> 00:20:43,120
 - Very squeezed in.

647
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:43,940
 - I know, I know.

648
00:20:43,940 --> 00:20:45,460
 - I think he was definitely quite puny as a baby.

649
00:20:45,460 --> 00:20:47,660
 And his mother gave birth and they went,

650
00:20:47,660 --> 00:20:49,740
 well, we'll set that aside 'cause it's not alive

651
00:20:49,740 --> 00:20:51,100
 and we'll retrieve the mother.

652
00:20:51,100 --> 00:20:54,100
 And they put him to one side thinking that he wasn't alive.

653
00:20:54,100 --> 00:20:54,940
 And then the midwife,

654
00:20:54,940 --> 00:20:56,500
 who probably wasn't doing a job particularly well,

655
00:20:56,500 --> 00:20:57,620
 said after a few minutes,

656
00:20:57,620 --> 00:20:59,580
 oh, hang on a second, this baby's alive.

657
00:20:59,580 --> 00:21:00,660
 We should keep it going.

658
00:21:00,660 --> 00:21:01,500
 - Good grief.

659
00:21:01,500 --> 00:21:02,340
 - And he was very,

660
00:21:02,340 --> 00:21:03,220
 and for the first few weeks,

661
00:21:03,220 --> 00:21:04,700
 everyone assumed that he would die.

662
00:21:04,700 --> 00:21:08,180
 And he was quite a weakling, I think, when he was younger.

663
00:21:08,180 --> 00:21:10,380
 - Are you guys any fans of his stuff?

664
00:21:10,380 --> 00:21:11,220
 - Yeah.

665
00:21:11,220 --> 00:21:12,900
 - Yeah, I read 'Test of the Doverbills' at school

666
00:21:12,900 --> 00:21:16,260
 and it was the first, as it were, literature book

667
00:21:16,260 --> 00:21:17,180
 that I'd write up until then,

668
00:21:17,180 --> 00:21:19,460
 I was reading 'Spin Off Indiana Jones Novelizations'

669
00:21:19,460 --> 00:21:21,460
 and it blew my mind.

670
00:21:21,460 --> 00:21:22,940
 I thought it was fantastic.

671
00:21:22,940 --> 00:21:23,780
 - Yeah.

672
00:21:23,780 --> 00:21:25,200
 - And he wrote my favorite poem.

673
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:26,040
 - Which one?

674
00:21:26,040 --> 00:21:27,940
 - 'The Darkling Thrush', amazing poem.

675
00:21:27,940 --> 00:21:29,140
 If you wanna read it.

676
00:21:29,140 --> 00:21:30,340
 - Well, he considered himself a poet

677
00:21:30,340 --> 00:21:31,860
 more than an author, didn't he?

678
00:21:31,860 --> 00:21:33,260
 Despite these, like, similar--

679
00:21:33,260 --> 00:21:34,780
 - He was much more successful as an author, right?

680
00:21:34,780 --> 00:21:35,780
 That's just like, yeah.

681
00:21:35,780 --> 00:21:38,180
 - He was extremely successful as a poet as well.

682
00:21:38,180 --> 00:21:39,980
 And the last 30 years of his life,

683
00:21:39,980 --> 00:21:41,740
 he only wrote poetry, didn't he?

684
00:21:41,740 --> 00:21:42,580
 - Yeah.

685
00:21:42,580 --> 00:21:43,740
 - Well, he had success, but this, to me,

686
00:21:43,740 --> 00:21:46,700
 is like, Ant and Deck considering themselves musicians.

687
00:21:46,700 --> 00:21:49,140
 But they've been successful in the charts,

688
00:21:49,140 --> 00:21:53,220
 but you wouldn't say the famous, he had a repertoire.

689
00:21:53,220 --> 00:21:55,180
 - Musicians, Ant and Deck, have died.

690
00:21:55,180 --> 00:21:56,020
 It's not what's gonna be--

691
00:21:56,020 --> 00:21:56,860
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

692
00:21:56,860 --> 00:21:57,700
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

693
00:21:57,700 --> 00:21:58,700
 - But this, to me, is just like, you know,

694
00:21:58,700 --> 00:22:01,100
 his Twitter bio would just be one of those ones

695
00:22:01,140 --> 00:22:02,140
 that's just like a list.

696
00:22:02,140 --> 00:22:05,940
 Poet, author, son, father, husband, twice.

697
00:22:05,940 --> 00:22:08,780
 - For anyone who's listening who's not a fan,

698
00:22:08,780 --> 00:22:09,900
 they're basically, the books are,

699
00:22:09,900 --> 00:22:12,420
 they're amazing, but they're also incredibly gloomy.

700
00:22:12,420 --> 00:22:15,940
 As in, they feature all sorts of, you know,

701
00:22:15,940 --> 00:22:17,980
 terribly unhappy people, you know,

702
00:22:17,980 --> 00:22:21,220
 making poor decisions and getting on badly with each other.

703
00:22:21,220 --> 00:22:22,540
 That's--

704
00:22:22,540 --> 00:22:24,620
 - Although, I think that he has a reputation.

705
00:22:24,620 --> 00:22:28,220
 Far from the running crowd is not a gloomy book.

706
00:22:28,220 --> 00:22:29,740
 Everyone always says such sad books,

707
00:22:29,740 --> 00:22:31,420
 but yeah, don't read "Judy Obscure," if you like.

708
00:22:31,420 --> 00:22:33,500
 - So "Judy Obscure," the Guardian, a few years ago,

709
00:22:33,500 --> 00:22:35,340
 they produced this fantastic infographic

710
00:22:35,340 --> 00:22:38,620
 on what each book contains in terms of various traumas.

711
00:22:38,620 --> 00:22:41,300
 Right, so "Judy Obscure" was by a long shot, the winner,

712
00:22:41,300 --> 00:22:43,140
 but it features, they just listed,

713
00:22:43,140 --> 00:22:44,860
 like, in little bullet points, what it features.

714
00:22:44,860 --> 00:22:46,380
 An unhappy relationship, a death,

715
00:22:46,380 --> 00:22:48,460
 another unhappy relationship, another unhappy relationship,

716
00:22:48,460 --> 00:22:51,700
 grinding poverty, suicide, murder, murder.

717
00:22:51,700 --> 00:22:54,340
 That's one child who kills two others and then himself.

718
00:22:54,340 --> 00:22:56,180
 Miscarriage, alcoholism, another death,

719
00:22:56,180 --> 00:22:58,540
 and animal genitalia-related injury,

720
00:22:58,540 --> 00:22:59,740
 which I had forgotten about,

721
00:22:59,740 --> 00:23:01,260
 but which does feature in "Judy Obscure."

722
00:23:01,260 --> 00:23:02,780
 - Does it, what happens? - Which bit is that?

723
00:23:02,780 --> 00:23:04,580
 - Jude, he meets his wife, Arabella,

724
00:23:04,580 --> 00:23:09,220
 when she throws a pig's-pizzle, a pig's penis at him,

725
00:23:09,220 --> 00:23:11,300
 and it wallops him on the bones.

726
00:23:11,300 --> 00:23:14,340
 - It's like, when you said animal-related

727
00:23:14,340 --> 00:23:17,620
 genital injury, I would never have guessed that.

728
00:23:17,620 --> 00:23:19,940
 I was going to something biting something.

729
00:23:19,940 --> 00:23:21,660
 - Yeah, exactly, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

730
00:23:21,660 --> 00:23:23,660
 - But I never would have thought

731
00:23:23,660 --> 00:23:25,500
 it was the animal's genital that was in--

732
00:23:25,500 --> 00:23:26,340
 - It was doing the injury.

733
00:23:26,340 --> 00:23:29,100
 It caused it to be a different part of his body.

734
00:23:29,100 --> 00:23:31,500
 - No, yeah, dismembered pig dick was not.

735
00:23:31,500 --> 00:23:32,820
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah. - Which is what I saw coming.

736
00:23:32,820 --> 00:23:35,180
 - On my bingo card for 1894.

737
00:23:35,180 --> 00:23:38,260
 (all laughing)

738
00:23:38,260 --> 00:23:41,900
 - I, so, got the training today to King's Cross,

739
00:23:41,900 --> 00:23:43,580
 and I had a bit of time on my hands,

740
00:23:43,580 --> 00:23:47,340
 and I went to see something pretty incredible.

741
00:23:47,340 --> 00:23:48,980
 - The tree? - Yeah.

742
00:23:48,980 --> 00:23:50,420
 I went to see the hardy tree.

743
00:23:50,420 --> 00:23:51,260
 - What's that?

744
00:23:51,260 --> 00:23:53,940
 - The hardy tree is Old St. Pancras Church,

745
00:23:53,940 --> 00:23:56,300
 which is just up the road from St. Pancras Station,

746
00:23:56,300 --> 00:23:58,740
 international, and it's a church

747
00:23:58,740 --> 00:24:00,860
 where you have a graveyard there,

748
00:24:00,860 --> 00:24:04,300
 and when hardy, prior to becoming a full-time writer,

749
00:24:04,300 --> 00:24:06,900
 I think maybe he was dabbling in writing at that point,

750
00:24:06,900 --> 00:24:08,780
 but he was an architect beforehand,

751
00:24:08,780 --> 00:24:10,460
 and he used to work in London,

752
00:24:10,460 --> 00:24:13,500
 and he worked for a company which was called Blumfield,

753
00:24:13,500 --> 00:24:15,980
 and one of the things that Blumfield needed to do

754
00:24:15,980 --> 00:24:18,740
 was they needed to move a lot of the graves

755
00:24:18,740 --> 00:24:20,940
 that were in the area to make room for a new rail track.

756
00:24:20,940 --> 00:24:23,780
 It was the mainland, midland Grand Railway,

757
00:24:23,780 --> 00:24:25,620
 and so they had to exhume bodies,

758
00:24:25,620 --> 00:24:27,780
 and it was something like thousands of bodies

759
00:24:27,780 --> 00:24:28,940
 that they had to exhume,

760
00:24:28,940 --> 00:24:30,900
 and they had all these leftover tombstones,

761
00:24:30,900 --> 00:24:33,580
 and hardy did this thing where there's

762
00:24:33,580 --> 00:24:35,780
 about a hundred of them of these tombstones,

763
00:24:35,780 --> 00:24:38,820
 they are all sort of layered in towards the tree,

764
00:24:38,820 --> 00:24:41,260
 and it's so hard to describe.

765
00:24:41,260 --> 00:24:42,420
 - They like circle the tree.

766
00:24:42,420 --> 00:24:43,980
 - Is the tree, 'cause the tree fell down, isn't it?

767
00:24:43,980 --> 00:24:46,140
 - The tree fell down in 2022.

768
00:24:46,140 --> 00:24:46,980
 - Oh, has it fallen?

769
00:24:46,980 --> 00:24:49,380
 I saw it years ago, but it was like the roots

770
00:24:49,380 --> 00:24:51,580
 were like growing over the tombstones.

771
00:24:51,580 --> 00:24:53,020
 It's almost like, give the illusion

772
00:24:53,020 --> 00:24:54,700
 that the tombstones were sinking

773
00:24:54,700 --> 00:24:56,620
 because roots were starting to grow over the top of them,

774
00:24:56,620 --> 00:24:57,740
 they were getting shorter and shorter.

775
00:24:57,740 --> 00:24:59,380
 - Yeah, so a storm. - But I didn't know it fell down,

776
00:24:59,380 --> 00:25:00,220
 so what is it?

777
00:25:00,220 --> 00:25:02,260
 - A storm took it out, but they've left,

778
00:25:02,260 --> 00:25:03,740
 there's a big fence around it at the moment,

779
00:25:03,740 --> 00:25:05,180
 they're working out what to do

780
00:25:05,180 --> 00:25:06,300
 and which way to restore it,

781
00:25:06,300 --> 00:25:09,900
 but yeah, that is literally a bit of art/architecture

782
00:25:09,900 --> 00:25:11,700
 by Thomas Hardy, as you say,

783
00:25:11,700 --> 00:25:13,780
 you saw it when it's full place,

784
00:25:13,780 --> 00:25:15,620
 and God, just generally, by the way,

785
00:25:15,620 --> 00:25:17,780
 what an extraordinary cemetery that is

786
00:25:17,780 --> 00:25:19,380
 with such notable people.

787
00:25:19,380 --> 00:25:20,940
 Mary Wollstonecraft is buried there,

788
00:25:20,940 --> 00:25:22,220
 who was the mother of Mary Shelley,

789
00:25:22,220 --> 00:25:24,140
 and there's this story which all academics

790
00:25:24,140 --> 00:25:25,780
 think is almost definitely true,

791
00:25:25,780 --> 00:25:26,620
 it's one of those ones where it's like,

792
00:25:26,620 --> 00:25:28,620
 "There might be a tiny grain of untruth."

793
00:25:28,620 --> 00:25:30,860
 It's where she used to go and sit and read

794
00:25:30,860 --> 00:25:32,860
 her mother's books against the tombstone,

795
00:25:32,860 --> 00:25:35,980
 and it's where her and Percy Shelley first had sex

796
00:25:35,980 --> 00:25:37,580
 on the tombstone, literally.

797
00:25:37,580 --> 00:25:38,700
 - That's the kind of thing they would have done.

798
00:25:38,700 --> 00:25:40,780
 - Yeah, but so. - Dofts, man.

799
00:25:40,780 --> 00:25:43,620
 (all laughing)

800
00:25:43,620 --> 00:25:44,740
 - I don't think that's fair.

801
00:25:44,740 --> 00:25:46,660
 - I'll highly recommend it, though.

802
00:25:46,660 --> 00:25:48,820
 (all laughing)

803
00:25:48,820 --> 00:25:49,660
 - Of course, you would,

804
00:25:49,660 --> 00:25:51,260
 and you recommend all sorts of stuff.

805
00:25:51,260 --> 00:25:53,940
 - I'll be going to the cemetery.

806
00:25:53,940 --> 00:25:55,740
 - Dansex Advice podcast.

807
00:25:55,740 --> 00:25:57,780
 It's gonna go down like a live balloon.

808
00:25:57,780 --> 00:25:58,620
 - But also, incidentally,

809
00:25:58,620 --> 00:26:00,460
 one of the people who were buried underneath,

810
00:26:00,460 --> 00:26:04,100
 supposedly, all those tombstones is the writer

811
00:26:04,100 --> 00:26:07,180
 who wrote The Vampire, who was part of that weekend

812
00:26:07,180 --> 00:26:08,500
 with Mary Shelley. - Oh, God.

813
00:26:08,500 --> 00:26:10,060
 - Poladori. - Yeah, Poladori.

814
00:26:10,060 --> 00:26:10,900
 - Poladori, yeah, yeah, yeah.

815
00:26:10,900 --> 00:26:13,460
 - Can I shatter your allusions, though,

816
00:26:13,460 --> 00:26:16,940
 about that lovely concentric circle gravestones and tree?

817
00:26:16,940 --> 00:26:19,340
 Tree has nothing to do with him.

818
00:26:19,340 --> 00:26:20,180
 - What?

819
00:26:20,180 --> 00:26:22,220
 - Yeah, everyone calls it the hardy tree.

820
00:26:22,220 --> 00:26:23,060
 There's no evidence.

821
00:26:23,060 --> 00:26:24,820
 It was planted in his life, like,

822
00:26:24,820 --> 00:26:26,740
 by him when he was an architect.

823
00:26:26,740 --> 00:26:27,580
 There's no evidence.

824
00:26:27,580 --> 00:26:28,780
 It was, they think it was planted

825
00:26:28,780 --> 00:26:30,380
 about 50 years after he died.

826
00:26:30,380 --> 00:26:31,700
 It only started being referenced in the--

827
00:26:31,700 --> 00:26:33,220
 - Oh, so he just made the circles--

828
00:26:33,220 --> 00:26:34,380
 - He made the circles, I thought.

829
00:26:34,380 --> 00:26:36,820
 - He, all we know, I'm pretty sure,

830
00:26:36,820 --> 00:26:38,100
 is that he was indeed employed

831
00:26:38,100 --> 00:26:39,420
 'cause he was low down in the architect's firm.

832
00:26:39,420 --> 00:26:40,260
 So the architect said,

833
00:26:40,260 --> 00:26:41,380
 "Could you dig up all these bodies?"

834
00:26:41,380 --> 00:26:43,180
 So he did dig up the bodies.

835
00:26:43,180 --> 00:26:47,300
 And he, in fact, he remembered later in his life

836
00:26:47,300 --> 00:26:48,380
 when they were digging up the bodies,

837
00:26:48,380 --> 00:26:51,140
 opening one grave that had two heads and one body.

838
00:26:51,140 --> 00:26:52,780
 And that was a fun--

839
00:26:52,780 --> 00:26:54,220
 - Wow. - One memory for him.

840
00:26:54,220 --> 00:26:55,740
 And he said some of them were just skeletons

841
00:26:55,740 --> 00:26:56,580
 loose in the ground.

842
00:26:56,580 --> 00:26:57,580
 Some of them, like, crumpled apart.

843
00:26:57,580 --> 00:26:59,180
 - He was digging them up personally.

844
00:26:59,180 --> 00:27:00,380
 - He was there overseeing it,

845
00:27:00,380 --> 00:27:02,060
 and other people under him were digging them up.

846
00:27:02,060 --> 00:27:03,140
 - Two heads, one body.

847
00:27:03,140 --> 00:27:03,980
 - Yeah.

848
00:27:03,980 --> 00:27:05,220
 We don't know he made the stone circle.

849
00:27:05,220 --> 00:27:06,060
 We just know he dug up the body.

850
00:27:06,060 --> 00:27:07,820
 - It sounds like he just littered some gravestones.

851
00:27:07,820 --> 00:27:08,660
 - He just dug up the--

852
00:27:08,660 --> 00:27:09,980
 - The story is losing the bodies in fact.

853
00:27:09,980 --> 00:27:11,580
 - A tree grew and turned them into a perfect circle.

854
00:27:11,580 --> 00:27:13,980
 It's, like, a naturally, like, a natural phenomenon.

855
00:27:13,980 --> 00:27:16,260
 Some poor person, probably a woman,

856
00:27:16,260 --> 00:27:17,100
 came after us and said,

857
00:27:17,100 --> 00:27:18,420
 "Hey, it would look nice if we did this."

858
00:27:18,420 --> 00:27:19,580
 And then everyone's gone,

859
00:27:19,580 --> 00:27:21,980
 "Oh, it was Tom Hardy, didn't it?"

860
00:27:21,980 --> 00:27:23,220
 - That's classic, Tom.

861
00:27:23,220 --> 00:27:24,060
 - Yeah.

862
00:27:24,060 --> 00:27:24,900
 - Can I, guys?

863
00:27:24,900 --> 00:27:25,740
 - How interesting.

864
00:27:25,740 --> 00:27:26,780
 - Can I give you guys a quiz?

865
00:27:26,780 --> 00:27:27,700
 - Oh, yeah. - Sure.

866
00:27:27,700 --> 00:27:30,020
 - Okay, so we all know Tom's Hardy,

867
00:27:30,020 --> 00:27:32,460
 and we all know about Kiss Me Hardy.

868
00:27:32,460 --> 00:27:33,300
 - Yeah.

869
00:27:33,300 --> 00:27:34,980
 - And we all know about Tom Hardy, the actor.

870
00:27:34,980 --> 00:27:35,820
 - Yeah.

871
00:27:35,820 --> 00:27:38,380
 - So, which Tom Hardy--

872
00:27:38,380 --> 00:27:39,660
 I've renamed these headlines,

873
00:27:39,660 --> 00:27:41,060
 so they'll all say Tom Hardy,

874
00:27:41,060 --> 00:27:42,500
 so that's not a clue, right?

875
00:27:42,500 --> 00:27:43,940
 Which Tom Hardy are these about?

876
00:27:43,940 --> 00:27:45,340
 - Yeah. - Okay?

877
00:27:45,340 --> 00:27:49,380
 Goldfish removed from Tom Hardy pond to protect nutes.

878
00:27:49,380 --> 00:27:51,060
 - Which Hardy is that about?

879
00:27:51,060 --> 00:27:52,220
 - The actor.

880
00:27:52,220 --> 00:27:53,060
 - Author.

881
00:27:53,060 --> 00:27:54,140
 - Author. - Author.

882
00:27:54,140 --> 00:27:54,980
 - You're both right.

883
00:27:54,980 --> 00:27:55,820
 Sorry, Dan.

884
00:27:55,820 --> 00:27:57,700
 - I was a bit loose calling him Tom.

885
00:27:57,700 --> 00:27:59,100
 - I've changed the headlines.

886
00:27:59,100 --> 00:27:59,940
 I've changed the headlines,

887
00:27:59,940 --> 00:28:00,780
 so they all say Tom Hardy,

888
00:28:00,780 --> 00:28:02,020
 so that's not to avoid being a clue.

889
00:28:02,020 --> 00:28:03,260
 - I see, sorry. - Because people only say

890
00:28:03,260 --> 00:28:05,260
 Tom was or Tom. - Yeah.

891
00:28:05,260 --> 00:28:07,500
 - Tom Hardy fuels James Bond rumours.

892
00:28:07,500 --> 00:28:09,100
 (all laughing)

893
00:28:09,100 --> 00:28:10,820
 - Well, no, actually, yeah.

894
00:28:10,820 --> 00:28:13,220
 Let's go back to when the first James Bond was written.

895
00:28:13,220 --> 00:28:15,220
 Let's do the dates a lot.

896
00:28:15,220 --> 00:28:17,060
 - Fleming was a port bearer at the order, too,

897
00:28:17,060 --> 00:28:18,260
 so I'm locking that in.

898
00:28:18,260 --> 00:28:19,300
 - Author.

899
00:28:19,300 --> 00:28:20,300
 - No, I'm so sorry, Dan.

900
00:28:20,300 --> 00:28:22,660
 That's about the actor Tom Hardy.

901
00:28:22,660 --> 00:28:23,500
 Last one.

902
00:28:23,500 --> 00:28:26,020
 Tom Hardy wins Jiu Jitsu contest in Milton Keynes.

903
00:28:26,020 --> 00:28:27,180
 (all laughing)

904
00:28:27,180 --> 00:28:28,020
 - I don't think it's any of them.

905
00:28:28,020 --> 00:28:29,940
 That's just a different bloke.

906
00:28:29,940 --> 00:28:31,060
 - No, it's the actor.

907
00:28:31,060 --> 00:28:33,740
 He, last year, he just turned up in Milton Keynes.

908
00:28:33,740 --> 00:28:36,220
 The Brazilian Jiu Jitsu Open Championship

909
00:28:36,220 --> 00:28:38,580
 held at a school in Milton Keynes

910
00:28:38,580 --> 00:28:40,140
 and kicked everyone's ass.

911
00:28:40,140 --> 00:28:41,140
 He won.

912
00:28:41,140 --> 00:28:41,980
 He was champion in his--

913
00:28:41,980 --> 00:28:43,500
 - Held at a school, but it was adults.

914
00:28:43,500 --> 00:28:44,340
 (all laughing)

915
00:28:44,340 --> 00:28:45,180
 - He was turned up and going,

916
00:28:45,180 --> 00:28:46,500
 "This should be important to God."

917
00:28:46,500 --> 00:28:47,860
 - He absolutely went through year eight

918
00:28:47,860 --> 00:28:49,860
 like a dose of salt.

919
00:28:49,860 --> 00:28:51,700
 No, he has a blue belt in Jiu Jitsu

920
00:28:51,700 --> 00:28:54,860
 and just destroyed everyone.

921
00:28:54,860 --> 00:28:56,180
 Cause it's quite intimidating if you turn up

922
00:28:56,180 --> 00:28:57,140
 and see Tom Hardy, you know,

923
00:28:57,140 --> 00:28:57,980
 - Yeah, no shit.

924
00:28:57,980 --> 00:28:59,180
 - being mad at Max.

925
00:28:59,180 --> 00:29:00,860
 - Are you allowed to just wander in?

926
00:29:00,860 --> 00:29:02,540
 Surely you have to have entered in advance.

927
00:29:02,540 --> 00:29:04,460
 - He did enter in advance.

928
00:29:04,460 --> 00:29:05,300
 - He registered.

929
00:29:05,300 --> 00:29:06,140
 - Oh, he registered, okay.

930
00:29:06,140 --> 00:29:08,340
 - He just registered like a normal person, you know.

931
00:29:08,340 --> 00:29:10,500
 - And I bet someone who's worked at that school

932
00:29:10,500 --> 00:29:12,180
 who was organising the whole thing,

933
00:29:12,180 --> 00:29:13,900
 read it and went, "It won't be that Tom Hardy."

934
00:29:13,900 --> 00:29:15,460
 (all laughing)

935
00:29:15,460 --> 00:29:18,780
 - He was like, "Fuck, yeah."

936
00:29:18,780 --> 00:29:19,940
 - Terrifying.

937
00:29:19,940 --> 00:29:21,900
 - Do you know, I just want to bring up

938
00:29:21,900 --> 00:29:25,020
 the second wife very quickly, Florence Dugdale.

939
00:29:25,020 --> 00:29:26,020
 So that was her name.

940
00:29:26,020 --> 00:29:29,100
 She was an author herself, published author.

941
00:29:29,100 --> 00:29:33,100
 And there was, as you say, huge age gap.

942
00:29:33,100 --> 00:29:34,540
 Apparently they got on really well though,

943
00:29:34,540 --> 00:29:35,860
 according to friends who also said

944
00:29:35,860 --> 00:29:39,020
 that the first wife and Thomas didn't get on.

945
00:29:39,020 --> 00:29:42,580
 She wrote a biography of him and he didn't burn it.

946
00:29:42,580 --> 00:29:44,380
 It was called "The Early Life."

947
00:29:44,380 --> 00:29:46,020
 - Is that 'cause he died?

948
00:29:46,020 --> 00:29:48,420
 - No, it's 'cause it turns out he actually wrote it

949
00:29:48,420 --> 00:29:51,540
 mostly himself and it was published under her name.

950
00:29:51,540 --> 00:29:53,300
 - Oh my God.

951
00:29:53,300 --> 00:29:54,140
 - That's the sort of thing you do

952
00:29:54,140 --> 00:29:55,860
 if your first wife released a book saying,

953
00:29:55,860 --> 00:29:57,300
 "You're a piece of shit."

954
00:29:57,300 --> 00:30:00,780
 And then you go, "Hmm, how can I protect my reputation here?"

955
00:30:00,780 --> 00:30:02,980
 (all laughing)

956
00:30:02,980 --> 00:30:04,060
 - Isn't that astonishing?

957
00:30:04,060 --> 00:30:06,060
 - That's really, and has that survived?

958
00:30:06,060 --> 00:30:06,900
 - Yeah, yeah.

959
00:30:06,900 --> 00:30:07,740
 - Because a lot of stuff didn't.

960
00:30:07,740 --> 00:30:08,580
 A lot of stuff was burnt.

961
00:30:08,580 --> 00:30:10,260
 A lot of his correspondence was burned

962
00:30:10,260 --> 00:30:11,540
 almost immediately after his death,

963
00:30:11,540 --> 00:30:13,980
 which has really vexed a lot of biographers, obviously,

964
00:30:13,980 --> 00:30:16,100
 because so much burning of books

965
00:30:16,100 --> 00:30:17,620
 went on back in the day, didn't it?

966
00:30:17,620 --> 00:30:19,060
 Like they were constantly burning books.

967
00:30:19,060 --> 00:30:21,500
 So he burned most of his own diaries, I think,

968
00:30:21,500 --> 00:30:23,700
 as well as burning his wife's diaries.

969
00:30:23,700 --> 00:30:25,820
 She burned, like his second wife,

970
00:30:25,820 --> 00:30:28,060
 burned the courtship letters between him and his first,

971
00:30:28,060 --> 00:30:28,900
 or I think maybe his first,

972
00:30:28,900 --> 00:30:30,220
 and everyone was burning letters and books

973
00:30:30,220 --> 00:30:31,100
 left around center.

974
00:30:31,100 --> 00:30:32,180
 Why don't we do this anymore?

975
00:30:32,180 --> 00:30:33,500
 - I do.

976
00:30:33,500 --> 00:30:34,340
 (all laughing)

977
00:30:34,340 --> 00:30:35,180
 I do, I'm so fine.

978
00:30:35,180 --> 00:30:36,980
 So many letters on this and I'm like,

979
00:30:36,980 --> 00:30:38,340
 "All of your wife's diaries."

980
00:30:38,340 --> 00:30:39,900
 But maybe they'll go in the fire.

981
00:30:39,900 --> 00:30:42,140
 - There you were criticizing my carbon footprint.

982
00:30:42,140 --> 00:30:43,780
 (all laughing)

983
00:30:43,780 --> 00:30:45,340
 - Burning every book he's ever read.

984
00:30:45,340 --> 00:30:47,820
 (all laughing)

985
00:30:47,820 --> 00:30:48,660
 Paul Bearers, obviously,

986
00:30:48,660 --> 00:30:49,900
 celebrity Paul Bearers, very cool.

987
00:30:49,900 --> 00:30:50,740
 - Oh yeah.

988
00:30:50,740 --> 00:30:53,420
 - There's a modern version of it, I'd say,

989
00:30:53,420 --> 00:30:55,660
 of having lots of, well, not famous people being Paul Bearers,

990
00:30:55,660 --> 00:30:58,020
 but something cool to do, which is Tupac.

991
00:30:58,020 --> 00:31:00,660
 You know, there's about Tupac in "Tupac's Dead."

992
00:31:00,660 --> 00:31:03,540
 Then Tupac's gang members smoked his ashes.

993
00:31:03,540 --> 00:31:04,860
 - Oh! - No way!

994
00:31:04,860 --> 00:31:07,900
 - Yeah, as was requested in a Tupac lyric,

995
00:31:07,900 --> 00:31:10,900
 he said in the lyric, "When I die, smoke my ashes," basically,

996
00:31:10,900 --> 00:31:12,780
 in slightly different words that I won't use.

997
00:31:12,780 --> 00:31:13,620
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

998
00:31:13,620 --> 00:31:14,460
 - I've got a question.

999
00:31:14,460 --> 00:31:15,280
 - Yeah?

1000
00:31:15,280 --> 00:31:17,540
 - How can you smoke them if they're already ashes?

1001
00:31:17,540 --> 00:31:18,500
 - Well, exactly. - You know what I mean?

1002
00:31:18,500 --> 00:31:19,340
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1003
00:31:19,340 --> 00:31:20,900
 - Like, he wasn't made of tobacco.

1004
00:31:20,900 --> 00:31:22,540
 - Well, I did say smoke his remains,

1005
00:31:22,540 --> 00:31:23,900
 but I'm doubting there's like an arm.

1006
00:31:23,900 --> 00:31:24,860
 (all laughing)

1007
00:31:24,860 --> 00:31:26,200
 - Did they smoke the ashes?

1008
00:31:26,200 --> 00:31:28,940
 - You did a very big fire pipe to get an arm into, wouldn't you?

1009
00:31:28,940 --> 00:31:29,780
 - Yeah.

1010
00:31:29,780 --> 00:31:30,620
 - No, what was ashes?

1011
00:31:30,620 --> 00:31:32,180
 I don't know, I guess they're just...

1012
00:31:32,180 --> 00:31:33,420
 - You just shove it in with, like,

1013
00:31:33,420 --> 00:31:34,980
 - Mix it in with some tobacco, love.

1014
00:31:34,980 --> 00:31:36,300
 - Mix it in, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1015
00:31:36,300 --> 00:31:38,980
 - And all the things. - And other things, yeah.

1016
00:31:38,980 --> 00:31:40,620
 - Yeah, I don't think it was tobacco.

1017
00:31:40,620 --> 00:31:43,200
 (upbeat music)

1018
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:48,500
 - Okay, it is time for fact number three,

1019
00:31:48,500 --> 00:31:49,660
 and that is my fact.

1020
00:31:49,660 --> 00:31:54,660
 My fact this week is that the UK literally have fashion police.

1021
00:31:54,660 --> 00:31:57,140
 Quite literally.

1022
00:31:57,140 --> 00:31:58,700
 - That speaks a guy who's just been arrested

1023
00:31:58,700 --> 00:32:00,880
 for that choice of hoodie.

1024
00:32:00,880 --> 00:32:04,380
 - So it turns out that one of the things,

1025
00:32:04,380 --> 00:32:05,460
 there's a lot of things that happen

1026
00:32:05,460 --> 00:32:07,380
 within police work with forensics,

1027
00:32:07,380 --> 00:32:09,620
 and a very important bit of it

1028
00:32:09,620 --> 00:32:12,420
 is trying to identify when a body might,

1029
00:32:12,420 --> 00:32:13,300
 you know, if you find a body,

1030
00:32:13,300 --> 00:32:14,860
 how long has it been there?

1031
00:32:14,860 --> 00:32:16,260
 Diagnosing all that stuff.

1032
00:32:16,260 --> 00:32:17,780
 And one of the things that might help you with that

1033
00:32:17,780 --> 00:32:19,700
 is the clothing that the person is wearing.

1034
00:32:19,700 --> 00:32:22,500
 And so there's this fashion historian called Amber Bouchard,

1035
00:32:22,500 --> 00:32:24,620
 and she basically goes around,

1036
00:32:24,620 --> 00:32:26,300
 and she worked for Beyond Retro,

1037
00:32:26,300 --> 00:32:27,760
 and she was a fashion historian.

1038
00:32:27,760 --> 00:32:30,060
 She liked to find where products were coming from,

1039
00:32:30,060 --> 00:32:32,720
 at what point they were using certain materials and so on.

1040
00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:36,380
 And there was a police forensic investigator

1041
00:32:36,380 --> 00:32:38,440
 who saw what she was doing after hearing her

1042
00:32:38,440 --> 00:32:39,580
 on a Radio 4 show and thought,

1043
00:32:39,580 --> 00:32:41,980
 "I wonder if that's gonna be interesting for me

1044
00:32:41,980 --> 00:32:44,700
 "in terms of trying to diagnose how all the body is,

1045
00:32:44,700 --> 00:32:46,060
 "or just give us a bit more detail."

1046
00:32:46,060 --> 00:32:47,060
 So that's what she does.

1047
00:32:47,060 --> 00:32:49,140
 She goes around for the UK police.

1048
00:32:49,140 --> 00:32:50,780
 She'll go to a murder scene,

1049
00:32:50,780 --> 00:32:53,220
 and she'll look at the exact fabric that they're wearing.

1050
00:32:53,220 --> 00:32:55,380
 And obviously, as we know, like, you know,

1051
00:32:55,380 --> 00:32:56,800
 if you were gonna die today,

1052
00:32:56,800 --> 00:32:59,020
 you might be wearing old clothes from--

1053
00:32:59,020 --> 00:33:00,820
 - I was gonna say, me and Andy gonna look like

1054
00:33:00,820 --> 00:33:01,740
 we're from the '50s,

1055
00:33:01,740 --> 00:33:04,300
 because we just have never bought new clothes for ourselves.

1056
00:33:04,300 --> 00:33:06,380
 - Exactly, yeah.

1057
00:33:06,380 --> 00:33:07,300
 That's the issue, right?

1058
00:33:07,300 --> 00:33:10,120
 - But I suppose it just plays into a bigger picture

1059
00:33:10,120 --> 00:33:10,960
 of what they're doing.

1060
00:33:10,960 --> 00:33:13,240
 So there's one story, which is a bit upsetting,

1061
00:33:13,240 --> 00:33:14,640
 but an old lady passed away

1062
00:33:14,640 --> 00:33:17,720
 and they found a body that was wrapped up in a bra,

1063
00:33:17,720 --> 00:33:19,200
 and she was able to look at the bra

1064
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:21,920
 and work out exactly when the bra was from

1065
00:33:21,920 --> 00:33:22,760
 to be able to say,

1066
00:33:22,760 --> 00:33:25,720
 "So it must have been this year that the body was in there."

1067
00:33:25,720 --> 00:33:26,880
 And she does it, by the way.

1068
00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:29,320
 There's a lot of amazing archives of clothing,

1069
00:33:29,320 --> 00:33:32,520
 and one big one is M&S have a massive archive of clothing

1070
00:33:32,520 --> 00:33:35,120
 that she can look through and find the history of items,

1071
00:33:35,120 --> 00:33:38,880
 'cause a lot of Brits are gonna be dying in M&S clothing.

1072
00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:40,120
 Sorry, just a quick--

1073
00:33:40,120 --> 00:33:42,560
 - I hope to one day, I hope to.

1074
00:33:42,560 --> 00:33:43,400
 (laughing)

1075
00:33:43,400 --> 00:33:44,620
 Actually, I don't mind when the day comes,

1076
00:33:44,620 --> 00:33:45,960
 as long as I'm in my trusty M&S.

1077
00:33:45,960 --> 00:33:46,800
 - That's what people say, isn't it?

1078
00:33:46,800 --> 00:33:48,040
 Yeah, it's like, people often,

1079
00:33:48,040 --> 00:33:49,020
 how they wanna die, they often say,

1080
00:33:49,020 --> 00:33:51,320
 "In my sleep, or in my M&S cookbook."

1081
00:33:51,320 --> 00:33:52,320
 (laughing)

1082
00:33:52,320 --> 00:33:53,380
 He does fine with me.

1083
00:33:53,380 --> 00:33:55,840
 - Yeah, and we should add that this is also not a sponsor

1084
00:33:55,840 --> 00:33:57,660
 that we're doing right now, yeah.

1085
00:33:57,660 --> 00:33:59,020
 - I reckon there's certain items of clothing

1086
00:33:59,020 --> 00:34:00,700
 where I could tell you when that person dies.

1087
00:34:00,700 --> 00:34:01,700
 - Oh, yeah.

1088
00:34:01,700 --> 00:34:04,300
 - Buried in a Von Dutch cap, I'm going 2001.

1089
00:34:04,300 --> 00:34:06,520
 Straight away, Liv's strong band.

1090
00:34:06,520 --> 00:34:08,840
 Come on, you're getting a five-year period.

1091
00:34:08,840 --> 00:34:09,680
 - Yeah, okay.

1092
00:34:09,680 --> 00:34:12,120
 - What about the cycles of fashion, though, every 30 years?

1093
00:34:12,120 --> 00:34:14,000
 It could always be the B, like, you know,

1094
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:16,000
 it was last year or 31 years ago.

1095
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:16,840
 - So it has to be, yeah,

1096
00:34:16,840 --> 00:34:18,820
 so it has to be something that hasn't yet come back.

1097
00:34:18,820 --> 00:34:19,660
 - Okay, so you know--

1098
00:34:19,660 --> 00:34:20,500
 - Yes, right.

1099
00:34:20,500 --> 00:34:21,340
 - Oh, it's not retro.

1100
00:34:21,340 --> 00:34:24,280
 It's like, white guy, dead in a Wu Tang 36 chambers top.

1101
00:34:24,280 --> 00:34:25,120
 - Sure.

1102
00:34:25,120 --> 00:34:25,960
 - '97, '98.

1103
00:34:25,960 --> 00:34:27,120
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, exactly.

1104
00:34:27,120 --> 00:34:28,640
 - So, well, I've always won flares.

1105
00:34:28,640 --> 00:34:31,000
 Sometimes, I would have confused the hell out of police,

1106
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:32,360
 at other times, it's perfectly acceptable.

1107
00:34:32,360 --> 00:34:33,500
 - I don't know what phase we're at now.

1108
00:34:33,500 --> 00:34:34,340
 Are we in a flares phase?

1109
00:34:34,340 --> 00:34:35,180
 - Yeah, we are, actually.

1110
00:34:35,180 --> 00:34:36,020
 - We are. - Oh, there we go.

1111
00:34:36,020 --> 00:34:36,860
 - I think often she just goes,

1112
00:34:36,860 --> 00:34:38,840
 "Wow, what we have here is a time traveler."

1113
00:34:38,840 --> 00:34:40,820
 (all laugh)

1114
00:34:40,820 --> 00:34:42,580
 - I recruited a bit of help by this.

1115
00:34:42,580 --> 00:34:44,380
 I wrote to an expert.

1116
00:34:44,380 --> 00:34:47,580
 Val McDermid, the author, a.k.a. Queen of Crime.

1117
00:34:47,580 --> 00:34:49,100
 - Holy shit, that's a clang.

1118
00:34:49,100 --> 00:34:53,020
 We thought the old curling team had a clang earlier.

1119
00:34:53,020 --> 00:34:54,540
 - Unnamed curling team.

1120
00:34:54,540 --> 00:34:55,860
 (all laugh)

1121
00:34:55,860 --> 00:34:58,140
 - No, I just, I know her very slightly,

1122
00:34:58,140 --> 00:35:00,020
 and I just asked her about this kind of stuff.

1123
00:35:00,020 --> 00:35:01,940
 She's written a book, as well as all her novels.

1124
00:35:01,940 --> 00:35:03,400
 She's written a book about forensics.

1125
00:35:03,400 --> 00:35:04,740
 - Oh, all right.

1126
00:35:04,740 --> 00:35:08,040
 - And she said that natural fabrics decay when you're buried.

1127
00:35:08,040 --> 00:35:09,320
 As in buried in the woods, you know,

1128
00:35:09,320 --> 00:35:11,200
 that kind of thing, if you've been killed.

1129
00:35:11,200 --> 00:35:12,960
 But labels are usually man-made fibers,

1130
00:35:12,960 --> 00:35:14,300
 so they survive, right?

1131
00:35:14,300 --> 00:35:15,480
 So they can provide a clue

1132
00:35:15,480 --> 00:35:17,800
 if it's foreign label or a designer label or whatever.

1133
00:35:17,800 --> 00:35:19,680
 So she says, "If you're planning a murder,

1134
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:21,880
 "go for mass produced cotton and snip those labels

1135
00:35:21,880 --> 00:35:23,600
 "when it comes to dressing your corpse."

1136
00:35:23,600 --> 00:35:24,440
 (all laugh)

1137
00:35:24,440 --> 00:35:25,440
 - It's nice, very helpful.

1138
00:35:25,440 --> 00:35:26,280
 - Yeah. - All right.

1139
00:35:26,280 --> 00:35:27,400
 - Thank you, Val. - Yeah.

1140
00:35:27,400 --> 00:35:28,760
 - That's good, 'cause you can tell

1141
00:35:28,760 --> 00:35:30,080
 how big the person was,

1142
00:35:30,080 --> 00:35:31,760
 even if the whole body's disintegrated, right?

1143
00:35:31,760 --> 00:35:35,240
 You can still be like, "Size eight, size 14."

1144
00:35:35,240 --> 00:35:37,800
 - This does feel like this story feels most like,

1145
00:35:37,800 --> 00:35:39,660
 you know, Netflix are on the phone buying the rights

1146
00:35:39,660 --> 00:35:42,080
 to this series, surely, of like the person

1147
00:35:42,080 --> 00:35:44,600
 who solves crimes based on labels you're wearing.

1148
00:35:44,600 --> 00:35:45,440
 - Oh, yeah. - Yeah.

1149
00:35:45,440 --> 00:35:46,280
 - Sorry, I thought you meant buying the rights

1150
00:35:46,280 --> 00:35:48,540
 to this podcast, which is so far.

1151
00:35:48,540 --> 00:35:49,480
 (all laugh)

1152
00:35:49,480 --> 00:35:51,380
 - They are available. - They are available, yeah.

1153
00:35:51,380 --> 00:35:52,220
 - And she's cool.

1154
00:35:52,220 --> 00:35:53,460
 Amber, if you see a photo of her,

1155
00:35:53,460 --> 00:35:57,800
 she dresses like someone from Beyond Retro would, right?

1156
00:35:57,800 --> 00:35:59,700
 Like she's got like old school clothing.

1157
00:35:59,700 --> 00:36:00,780
 She looks like she could be

1158
00:36:00,780 --> 00:36:01,920
 in a sort of Agatha Christie view.

1159
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:03,360
 - She'd be a vintage detective.

1160
00:36:03,360 --> 00:36:04,920
 What could we call it?

1161
00:36:04,920 --> 00:36:05,760
 - What, the series?

1162
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:06,880
 - Yeah, series called--

1163
00:36:06,880 --> 00:36:07,920
 - "Drop Dead Gorgeous."

1164
00:36:07,920 --> 00:36:08,760
 - "Drop Dead Gorgeous."

1165
00:36:08,760 --> 00:36:10,000
 - Yes. - "Dressed to Kill."

1166
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:10,960
 - Brilliant. - Oh, yes.

1167
00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:12,160
 - Yeah, yeah. - Yeah.

1168
00:36:12,160 --> 00:36:13,400
 - All right, we've got two films.

1169
00:36:13,400 --> 00:36:15,640
 (all laugh)

1170
00:36:15,640 --> 00:36:16,480
 - Have you heard about this thing

1171
00:36:16,480 --> 00:36:18,400
 of the principle of interchange

1172
00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:20,080
 or the principle of transference?

1173
00:36:20,080 --> 00:36:22,280
 So one of the fathers of forensics

1174
00:36:22,280 --> 00:36:24,760
 was a Frenchman called Edmund Lockhart in Leon,

1175
00:36:24,760 --> 00:36:27,560
 and his basic theory is that any two objects interacting

1176
00:36:27,560 --> 00:36:28,680
 will leave a trace.

1177
00:36:28,680 --> 00:36:30,640
 So when you commit a crime,

1178
00:36:30,640 --> 00:36:34,740
 you will leave something behind that wasn't there before,

1179
00:36:34,740 --> 00:36:36,300
 like a bullet in a person,

1180
00:36:36,300 --> 00:36:37,540
 and you will take away something

1181
00:36:37,540 --> 00:36:38,900
 that was there originally, right?

1182
00:36:38,900 --> 00:36:40,980
 So that's just like the founding principle.

1183
00:36:40,980 --> 00:36:43,420
 So all you have to do is work hard to find those.

1184
00:36:43,420 --> 00:36:44,380
 - Well, so that you'll take away

1185
00:36:44,380 --> 00:36:45,500
 like a bit of dust or something.

1186
00:36:45,500 --> 00:36:46,340
 It's not like you're always--

1187
00:36:46,340 --> 00:36:47,700
 - Exactly, yeah, or a fiber on your shirt.

1188
00:36:47,700 --> 00:36:48,540
 - No, it's super near. - Whatever.

1189
00:36:48,540 --> 00:36:49,380
 - Yeah, no.

1190
00:36:49,380 --> 00:36:50,300
 - It's always gone off the finger.

1191
00:36:50,300 --> 00:36:51,540
 - Yeah, yeah.

1192
00:36:51,540 --> 00:36:54,060
 But this, now we are so good

1193
00:36:54,060 --> 00:36:55,860
 that that sometimes makes things difficult

1194
00:36:55,860 --> 00:36:56,700
 for forensics people.

1195
00:36:56,700 --> 00:36:58,460
 So for example, if I hug Rhys,

1196
00:36:58,460 --> 00:36:59,960
 and then I am murdered,

1197
00:36:59,960 --> 00:37:02,200
 Rhys will have my DNA,

1198
00:37:02,200 --> 00:37:04,360
 or sorry, my body's tested,

1199
00:37:04,360 --> 00:37:07,280
 it'll have DNA from Rhys's clothes on it,

1200
00:37:07,280 --> 00:37:08,720
 despite the fact he had nothing to do with it.

1201
00:37:08,720 --> 00:37:11,120
 So that suddenly means that he might have to be questioned

1202
00:37:11,120 --> 00:37:12,360
 or involved or whatever it is.

1203
00:37:12,360 --> 00:37:14,240
 So that's the extent to which forensics

1204
00:37:14,240 --> 00:37:15,080
 is advanced these days.

1205
00:37:15,080 --> 00:37:16,680
 It's so good now.

1206
00:37:16,680 --> 00:37:18,440
 You can recreate so much stuff.

1207
00:37:18,440 --> 00:37:20,640
 - Yeah, so surely it's got to the point where it's so good.

1208
00:37:20,640 --> 00:37:22,760
 Now the list of suspects is way too big

1209
00:37:22,760 --> 00:37:24,200
 and makes this way harder.

1210
00:37:24,200 --> 00:37:26,400
 So it's defeated, it's sort of eaten itself.

1211
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:28,540
 - It's sort of, yeah, like those detective clothes,

1212
00:37:28,540 --> 00:37:29,820
 room things, it's only like,

1213
00:37:29,820 --> 00:37:31,620
 it's 5,000 people going to the room.

1214
00:37:31,620 --> 00:37:32,780
 - Yeah, probably all of them are just like,

1215
00:37:32,780 --> 00:37:34,120
 "Oh, you need it."

1216
00:37:34,120 --> 00:37:36,900
 (all laughing)

1217
00:37:36,900 --> 00:37:38,380
 - It's obviously they've got good methods

1218
00:37:38,380 --> 00:37:39,460
 to winnow it down.

1219
00:37:39,460 --> 00:37:40,300
 - Yeah, sure.

1220
00:37:40,300 --> 00:37:41,140
 - And you'd probably be released with that charge

1221
00:37:41,140 --> 00:37:41,980
 after a day or two, Rhys, but--

1222
00:37:41,980 --> 00:37:43,420
 - I don't know, I'll give up a voice.

1223
00:37:43,420 --> 00:37:44,260
 (all laughing)

1224
00:37:44,260 --> 00:37:45,920
 I've got those sort of eyes.

1225
00:37:45,920 --> 00:37:46,820
 - The motive's there.

1226
00:37:46,820 --> 00:37:49,220
 You've spent two hours with him now, so,

1227
00:37:49,220 --> 00:37:51,020
 we'd all understand.

1228
00:37:51,020 --> 00:37:51,860
 - I would be cool.

1229
00:37:51,860 --> 00:37:53,900
 I mean, I've got, I've read about how cat hair

1230
00:37:53,900 --> 00:37:55,300
 is like one of the main things, right?

1231
00:37:55,300 --> 00:37:57,560
 Like murderers who have cats.

1232
00:37:57,560 --> 00:38:00,040
 Getting caught quite quickly, because if anyone,

1233
00:38:00,040 --> 00:38:01,080
 if any of you've got a cat, you know,

1234
00:38:01,080 --> 00:38:03,080
 that you basically constantly have cat hair on you.

1235
00:38:03,080 --> 00:38:03,920
 - Right, right.

1236
00:38:03,920 --> 00:38:05,160
 - And so everywhere you go, you're just,

1237
00:38:05,160 --> 00:38:07,280
 you're molting like a cat and cat hair is coming off.

1238
00:38:07,280 --> 00:38:08,120
 - But then--

1239
00:38:08,120 --> 00:38:09,520
 - And I have a ginger cat, so, you know,

1240
00:38:09,520 --> 00:38:11,720
 that's just the most visible one, basically.

1241
00:38:11,720 --> 00:38:13,680
 - But do police now go around, someone's murdered?

1242
00:38:13,680 --> 00:38:15,320
 Are they now going around everyone's house,

1243
00:38:15,320 --> 00:38:16,920
 testing not only other people in the house,

1244
00:38:16,920 --> 00:38:18,000
 but their cats as well?

1245
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:19,640
 You're getting off the door, say.

1246
00:38:19,640 --> 00:38:20,960
 - Maybe, maybe that's a double match.

1247
00:38:20,960 --> 00:38:22,680
 You've got you and your cat.

1248
00:38:22,680 --> 00:38:25,400
 - Right, we're looking for a British short hair.

1249
00:38:25,400 --> 00:38:28,540
 Great fair, yeah.

1250
00:38:28,540 --> 00:38:30,780
 - Do you know you can catch people by different prints

1251
00:38:30,780 --> 00:38:33,120
 that aren't fingerprints, various other prints.

1252
00:38:33,120 --> 00:38:33,960
 - Tongue?

1253
00:38:33,960 --> 00:38:35,660
 - So, tongue prints are the thing you could,

1254
00:38:35,660 --> 00:38:37,500
 'cause that's individual, although I'm not sure

1255
00:38:37,500 --> 00:38:40,180
 how many people lick the murder scene before leaving.

1256
00:38:40,180 --> 00:38:41,820
 - Oh, you said tongue, I thought I heard time,

1257
00:38:41,820 --> 00:38:43,900
 which time prints would be as well?

1258
00:38:43,900 --> 00:38:44,740
 - Time prints.

1259
00:38:44,740 --> 00:38:46,180
 - Time print, do you leave a time print?

1260
00:38:46,180 --> 00:38:49,740
 - Yeah, if you, your mobile phone leaves a signal.

1261
00:38:49,740 --> 00:38:52,360
 - Oh, yeah, of course. - That's a lot of modern

1262
00:38:52,360 --> 00:38:54,080
 detective work. - Is that a time print?

1263
00:38:54,080 --> 00:38:55,120
 Did he leave a time print?

1264
00:38:55,120 --> 00:38:55,960
 - Well, I thought that's what Rie said

1265
00:38:55,960 --> 00:38:56,800
 and I was just trying to help.

1266
00:38:56,800 --> 00:38:58,480
 - It's cool, I like the sound of, yes.

1267
00:38:58,480 --> 00:38:59,440
 - And if you punch in and out,

1268
00:38:59,440 --> 00:39:02,120
 like you would at a work factory, for every murder,

1269
00:39:02,120 --> 00:39:03,440
 you'd let some of the time stand,

1270
00:39:03,440 --> 00:39:05,280
 but you know, there's no way they have to check

1271
00:39:05,280 --> 00:39:08,640
 into a building to find a record, you know what I mean.

1272
00:39:08,640 --> 00:39:10,840
 - There's the comments book on the way out.

1273
00:39:10,840 --> 00:39:12,600
 (all laughing)

1274
00:39:12,600 --> 00:39:16,520
 - Died lovely, really easy to kill, thank you.

1275
00:39:16,520 --> 00:39:19,680
 - He had the two star review, that's terrible.

1276
00:39:19,680 --> 00:39:22,960
 - That's a real crime, crime goes, there's a lovely hotel.

1277
00:39:22,960 --> 00:39:26,420
 - None of this is, is what I said.

1278
00:39:26,420 --> 00:39:28,380
 - Prints. - Prints, glove prints.

1279
00:39:28,380 --> 00:39:30,260
 So-- - Wow, what?

1280
00:39:30,260 --> 00:39:31,800
 That's the whole point of gloves, isn't it?

1281
00:39:31,800 --> 00:39:33,420
 - Yeah, that's brilliant, this context.

1282
00:39:33,420 --> 00:39:35,700
 - No, right, first of all, you hugged Andy on the way in

1283
00:39:35,700 --> 00:39:38,940
 and you're wearing gloves, none of this can work, Rie's.

1284
00:39:38,940 --> 00:39:40,860
 So, yeah, people can take glove prints

1285
00:39:40,860 --> 00:39:42,620
 and because people think what you guys think,

1286
00:39:42,620 --> 00:39:44,260
 which is that wearing gloves, I'm safe,

1287
00:39:44,260 --> 00:39:46,060
 they leave a lot more, they're much more cavalier

1288
00:39:46,060 --> 00:39:47,740
 than they are with fingerprints.

1289
00:39:47,740 --> 00:39:49,140
 But now there are various police forces

1290
00:39:49,140 --> 00:39:51,000
 that have made databases of glove prints,

1291
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:53,400
 so if they can match it to another glove print

1292
00:39:53,400 --> 00:39:55,000
 found at a different place,

1293
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:56,640
 then they'll know that it's the same person.

1294
00:39:56,640 --> 00:39:58,560
 - Just fibres that come off the gloves or?

1295
00:39:58,560 --> 00:40:00,560
 - Yeah, from the fibres that come off the glove

1296
00:40:00,560 --> 00:40:02,400
 and the pattern that the glove makes on,

1297
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:04,000
 you know, it'll make an imprint and even--

1298
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:05,240
 - That's so clever.

1299
00:40:05,240 --> 00:40:06,920
 - And it's even, it doesn't matter if it's the same

1300
00:40:06,920 --> 00:40:09,320
 brand of glove that I'm wearing compared to you, Andy,

1301
00:40:09,320 --> 00:40:11,320
 because I'll be doing different things with my glove

1302
00:40:11,320 --> 00:40:12,520
 to what you're doing with your glove

1303
00:40:12,520 --> 00:40:14,080
 and so it'll wear in a different way.

1304
00:40:14,080 --> 00:40:15,720
 - Stop it, how interesting.

1305
00:40:15,720 --> 00:40:17,720
 - It's absolutely nuts, what can be done.

1306
00:40:17,720 --> 00:40:20,220
 - Ear prints, someone was caught in France

1307
00:40:20,220 --> 00:40:23,460
 by their ear prints 'cause they'd been listening up

1308
00:40:23,460 --> 00:40:25,880
 against the keyholes of lots of student halls doors.

1309
00:40:25,880 --> 00:40:27,200
 - Wow.

1310
00:40:27,200 --> 00:40:29,040
 - That's incredible.

1311
00:40:29,040 --> 00:40:30,540
 - That's amazing.

1312
00:40:30,540 --> 00:40:32,220
 - 'Cause that, yeah, footprint or shoe prints,

1313
00:40:32,220 --> 00:40:34,060
 I imagine, as well, would be a thing.

1314
00:40:34,060 --> 00:40:35,620
 You would see a size 12 Adidas,

1315
00:40:35,620 --> 00:40:38,340
 you might have certain muds and stuff that you can,

1316
00:40:38,340 --> 00:40:41,660
 yeah, but ear print, that's like, yeah, eyebrow print

1317
00:40:41,660 --> 00:40:43,540
 or, that's so neat.

1318
00:40:43,540 --> 00:40:45,340
 - Can we say you can get a bum print?

1319
00:40:45,340 --> 00:40:47,700
 - What do you mean get a, what, do you sit on a photograph?

1320
00:40:47,700 --> 00:40:50,300
 - But don't you, you have a bum print.

1321
00:40:50,300 --> 00:40:51,680
 I just wonder, I mean, I just wonder

1322
00:40:51,680 --> 00:40:52,520
 if that's what's been used.

1323
00:40:52,520 --> 00:40:53,360
 - Sorry, everyone's-

1324
00:40:53,360 --> 00:40:54,920
 - Well, you're sorry, you're not trying to,

1325
00:40:54,920 --> 00:40:56,680
 you mean if you put, if you the murderer

1326
00:40:56,680 --> 00:40:59,880
 would put their bear off or something at the scene,

1327
00:40:59,880 --> 00:41:02,480
 they could go, oh, we know who the bum that is.

1328
00:41:02,480 --> 00:41:03,320
 - Exactly.

1329
00:41:03,320 --> 00:41:04,760
 - It's a classic calling card for a lot of people.

1330
00:41:04,760 --> 00:41:05,600
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1331
00:41:05,600 --> 00:41:07,760
 It's the police line up for those.

1332
00:41:07,760 --> 00:41:08,760
 - Yeah, turn around.

1333
00:41:08,760 --> 00:41:09,760
 - An amazing sight.

1334
00:41:09,760 --> 00:41:11,400
 (laughing)

1335
00:41:11,400 --> 00:41:14,100
 Can bum number two move around then, please?

1336
00:41:14,100 --> 00:41:16,620
 (laughing)

1337
00:41:16,620 --> 00:41:18,280
 Have you, this is a very cool thing.

1338
00:41:18,280 --> 00:41:20,240
 Have you had a forensic ecology?

1339
00:41:20,240 --> 00:41:21,400
 - Forensic ecology.

1340
00:41:21,400 --> 00:41:23,200
 - This is a, I read an interview

1341
00:41:23,200 --> 00:41:24,360
 with a woman called Rosie Everett.

1342
00:41:24,360 --> 00:41:26,040
 She uses materials found in the natural world

1343
00:41:26,040 --> 00:41:26,960
 to solve crimes, right?

1344
00:41:26,960 --> 00:41:30,360
 So, specifically micro fossils.

1345
00:41:30,360 --> 00:41:31,200
 - Oh.

1346
00:41:31,200 --> 00:41:32,280
 - There are these things called diatoms.

1347
00:41:32,280 --> 00:41:34,720
 We've spoken about them, I think ages ago.

1348
00:41:34,720 --> 00:41:37,440
 Basically, they're microscopic single cell algae

1349
00:41:37,440 --> 00:41:39,720
 and she can use these, the presence of these

1350
00:41:39,720 --> 00:41:42,040
 to come up with a profile of the soil in an area

1351
00:41:42,040 --> 00:41:43,240
 which can then solve a crime.

1352
00:41:43,240 --> 00:41:45,520
 So, there was, there's a castle

1353
00:41:45,520 --> 00:41:47,100
 in Cheshire called Beast and Castle, right?

1354
00:41:47,100 --> 00:41:48,620
 Which is a protected area.

1355
00:41:48,620 --> 00:41:52,420
 And there were some metal detectorists,

1356
00:41:52,420 --> 00:41:56,380
 night hawks, dirt sharks who'd gone and nicked

1357
00:41:56,380 --> 00:42:00,660
 at like bronze age artifacts from the soil around there.

1358
00:42:00,660 --> 00:42:01,660
 And when they caught, they just say,

1359
00:42:01,660 --> 00:42:03,060
 oh, we found them somewhere else.

1360
00:42:03,060 --> 00:42:05,100
 Can't prove anything, you know.

1361
00:42:05,100 --> 00:42:08,220
 Except for Rosie Everett, who came up with the,

1362
00:42:08,220 --> 00:42:10,940
 a profile of the soil based on the microscopic algae

1363
00:42:10,940 --> 00:42:14,100
 found there and proved that's the soil

1364
00:42:14,100 --> 00:42:15,060
 they've been taken from.

1365
00:42:15,060 --> 00:42:15,900
 - Oh.

1366
00:42:15,900 --> 00:42:17,440
 - What, looked at the objects and went,

1367
00:42:17,440 --> 00:42:18,280
 hey, this soil's the same.

1368
00:42:18,280 --> 00:42:20,120
 - Yeah, there was a bit of soil found on the bronze age

1369
00:42:20,120 --> 00:42:21,680
 artifacts they'd nicked from there.

1370
00:42:21,680 --> 00:42:22,960
 And there was a bit of soil around the castle.

1371
00:42:22,960 --> 00:42:24,120
 Like, just so difficult.

1372
00:42:24,120 --> 00:42:25,680
 - Wasn't one of the ways they caught Ian Huntley

1373
00:42:25,680 --> 00:42:27,200
 from nettle disturbance.

1374
00:42:27,200 --> 00:42:28,040
 - Really?

1375
00:42:28,040 --> 00:42:30,280
 - So nettles, he trampled nettles

1376
00:42:30,280 --> 00:42:32,080
 that meant that they were now growing outwards

1377
00:42:32,080 --> 00:42:33,360
 in a way they don't naturally.

1378
00:42:33,360 --> 00:42:34,840
 That sort of proved that he was there

1379
00:42:34,840 --> 00:42:36,840
 in the woods at that time or something.

1380
00:42:36,840 --> 00:42:38,440
 - Well, so it's next generation nettles

1381
00:42:38,440 --> 00:42:40,080
 still affected by the previous?

1382
00:42:40,080 --> 00:42:41,680
 - Yeah, it's like months later they had grown

1383
00:42:41,680 --> 00:42:43,280
 in a certain like, 'cause they would've been,

1384
00:42:43,280 --> 00:42:45,040
 and then they went out instead of up.

1385
00:42:45,040 --> 00:42:45,860
 - Yeah.

1386
00:42:45,860 --> 00:42:46,700
 - Or something like that.

1387
00:42:46,700 --> 00:42:47,540
 They was like, yeah.

1388
00:42:47,540 --> 00:42:48,380
 - That's incredible.

1389
00:42:48,380 --> 00:42:49,220
 - That's mad.

1390
00:42:49,220 --> 00:42:50,060
 And slightly less, I'll just quickly tell you,

1391
00:42:50,060 --> 00:42:52,720
 a slightly less technologically advanced one

1392
00:42:52,720 --> 00:42:55,340
 of this guy I read about who got caught

1393
00:42:55,340 --> 00:42:58,980
 doing a crime after he got the crime scene

1394
00:42:58,980 --> 00:43:02,160
 very in a lot of detail tattooed on his chest.

1395
00:43:02,160 --> 00:43:03,000
 - Oh, gosh.

1396
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:03,980
 (laughing)

1397
00:43:03,980 --> 00:43:05,460
 - So he literally, it was like,

1398
00:43:05,460 --> 00:43:07,280
 he'd like murdered someone outside a liquor store

1399
00:43:07,280 --> 00:43:08,120
 or something.

1400
00:43:08,120 --> 00:43:09,500
 And so he got the liquor store like a painting

1401
00:43:09,500 --> 00:43:11,720
 on his chest with him doing the murder.

1402
00:43:11,720 --> 00:43:12,560
 - No, no.

1403
00:43:12,560 --> 00:43:14,300
 - And above it he says the name of his gang,

1404
00:43:14,300 --> 00:43:17,800
 which was Rivera, he said Rivera kills above it.

1405
00:43:17,800 --> 00:43:19,240
 And it was like a revenge killing.

1406
00:43:19,240 --> 00:43:20,640
 And he had that on his chest.

1407
00:43:20,640 --> 00:43:22,680
 And one day the police were just like,

1408
00:43:22,680 --> 00:43:25,000
 flicking through a book of gang tattoos apparently.

1409
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:25,840
 (laughing)

1410
00:43:25,840 --> 00:43:27,400
 And they were like, wait, that's that liquor store.

1411
00:43:27,400 --> 00:43:29,120
 We've been trying to figure out where that guy,

1412
00:43:29,120 --> 00:43:29,960
 who killed that guy.

1413
00:43:29,960 --> 00:43:31,160
 That's that guy killed that guy.

1414
00:43:31,160 --> 00:43:32,320
 And then he was just trying to then.

1415
00:43:32,320 --> 00:43:33,440
 - That's brilliant.

1416
00:43:33,440 --> 00:43:35,440
 We've spoken about in the past how the Yakuza

1417
00:43:35,440 --> 00:43:37,160
 would be busted because they all have

1418
00:43:37,160 --> 00:43:38,640
 very individualistic tattoos.

1419
00:43:38,640 --> 00:43:39,480
 And if they're on the run,

1420
00:43:39,480 --> 00:43:40,760
 they might show up on Instagram,

1421
00:43:40,760 --> 00:43:42,720
 sort of like, you know, topless.

1422
00:43:42,720 --> 00:43:43,560
 - Yeah.

1423
00:43:43,560 --> 00:43:48,260
 - And you'll be like, hey, that's him, that's the guy.

1424
00:43:48,260 --> 00:43:52,260
 Like tattoo spotting is a big way of busting criminals.

1425
00:43:52,260 --> 00:43:54,780
 Did you say your one, Andy, happened in Beeston?

1426
00:43:54,780 --> 00:43:55,620
 - Yeah.

1427
00:43:55,620 --> 00:43:57,220
 - Well, that was when we did our first book of the year.

1428
00:43:57,220 --> 00:43:59,820
 There was a crime there committed,

1429
00:43:59,820 --> 00:44:03,180
 which was thousands of bees were stolen from Beeston.

1430
00:44:03,180 --> 00:44:05,420
 I wonder if she can solve that crime now

1431
00:44:05,420 --> 00:44:07,040
 using this new technology.

1432
00:44:07,040 --> 00:44:07,880
 - Wow.

1433
00:44:07,880 --> 00:44:09,380
 - I just, I'd sort of forgotten that,

1434
00:44:09,380 --> 00:44:11,220
 but as soon as you said we'd had it in our book,

1435
00:44:11,220 --> 00:44:13,200
 I thought we'd all have been a story about bees,

1436
00:44:13,200 --> 00:44:14,040
 won't it?

1437
00:44:14,040 --> 00:44:14,880
 (laughing)

1438
00:44:14,880 --> 00:44:15,720
 That's the level we operate at.

1439
00:44:15,720 --> 00:44:16,800
 - We put it on the back.

1440
00:44:16,800 --> 00:44:17,880
 It's Sue, it's our burp.

1441
00:44:17,880 --> 00:44:19,660
 That was our leading fact.

1442
00:44:19,660 --> 00:44:20,660
 - Of the burp.

1443
00:44:20,660 --> 00:44:23,240
 (upbeat music)

1444
00:44:23,240 --> 00:44:28,960
 - Okay, it is time for our final fact of the show.

1445
00:44:28,960 --> 00:44:30,520
 And that is Anna.

1446
00:44:30,520 --> 00:44:33,760
 - My fact this week is that parents of newborn penguins

1447
00:44:33,760 --> 00:44:36,180
 take thousands of naps per day.

1448
00:44:36,180 --> 00:44:38,360
 - Lazy.

1449
00:44:38,360 --> 00:44:39,200
 - Absolutely slackers.

1450
00:44:39,200 --> 00:44:40,040
 - Lazy.

1451
00:44:40,040 --> 00:44:40,860
 - Yeah.

1452
00:44:40,860 --> 00:44:42,480
 - And I'm taking very short naps.

1453
00:44:42,480 --> 00:44:43,700
 These are chin strap penguins.

1454
00:44:43,700 --> 00:44:46,640
 So they live in the Antarctic and around the South Pacific.

1455
00:44:46,640 --> 00:44:49,660
 And they, they were scientists studying them recently

1456
00:44:49,660 --> 00:44:50,700
 on King George Island,

1457
00:44:50,700 --> 00:44:54,700
 and they found that they nap over 10,000 times a day,

1458
00:44:54,700 --> 00:44:58,380
 but they only nap for about four seconds at a time

1459
00:44:58,380 --> 00:44:59,220
 on average.

1460
00:44:59,220 --> 00:45:00,220
 (laughing)

1461
00:45:00,220 --> 00:45:01,740
 But still, it gets them something.

1462
00:45:01,740 --> 00:45:04,660
 And I mean, they managed to tot up 11 hours of sleep a day.

1463
00:45:04,660 --> 00:45:05,500
 - That's insane.

1464
00:45:05,500 --> 00:45:06,320
 - Amazing.

1465
00:45:06,320 --> 00:45:07,160
 - Which is a lot less.

1466
00:45:07,160 --> 00:45:08,000
 - It's basically really blinking.

1467
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:08,820
 It's basically, every time they blink,

1468
00:45:08,820 --> 00:45:10,240
 they do it for four seconds and fall asleep.

1469
00:45:10,240 --> 00:45:11,080
 - Yeah.

1470
00:45:11,080 --> 00:45:13,520
 - It's like when you fall asleep at the cinema

1471
00:45:13,520 --> 00:45:15,300
 or the theater, you know?

1472
00:45:15,300 --> 00:45:16,280
 And you have that kind of,

1473
00:45:16,280 --> 00:45:17,120
 (gagging)

1474
00:45:17,120 --> 00:45:18,180
 - Yeah, or train them, jolt.

1475
00:45:18,180 --> 00:45:19,020
 - Yeah, yeah.

1476
00:45:19,020 --> 00:45:20,240
 I've never left one of those occasions

1477
00:45:20,240 --> 00:45:22,120
 feeling noticeably rested.

1478
00:45:22,120 --> 00:45:22,960
 - No.

1479
00:45:22,960 --> 00:45:24,160
 - Despite doing that kind of semi-sleep.

1480
00:45:24,160 --> 00:45:26,180
 - But I wonder if you had a thousand of them.

1481
00:45:26,180 --> 00:45:27,020
 - Yeah, true.

1482
00:45:27,020 --> 00:45:27,860
 - Yeah.

1483
00:45:27,860 --> 00:45:28,700
 - Yeah.

1484
00:45:28,700 --> 00:45:29,540
 - You just haven't been to a long enough play.

1485
00:45:29,540 --> 00:45:30,380
 - Oh, I'm sorry.

1486
00:45:30,380 --> 00:45:33,200
 - You know how you get those sort of rise and grind

1487
00:45:33,200 --> 00:45:34,240
 influences these days.

1488
00:45:34,240 --> 00:45:36,200
 So all about, you know, getting up at five AM,

1489
00:45:36,200 --> 00:45:37,500
 doing a gratitude journal.

1490
00:45:37,500 --> 00:45:39,020
 You've got to like circadian rhythm

1491
00:45:39,020 --> 00:45:39,860
 and all that sort of stuff.

1492
00:45:39,860 --> 00:45:42,140
 And you've got to get sunlight before coffee and all this.

1493
00:45:42,140 --> 00:45:43,640
 I mean, do you think if they read this pretty soon,

1494
00:45:43,640 --> 00:45:45,740
 everyone would be like, no, no, no, don't go to bed.

1495
00:45:45,740 --> 00:45:46,660
 Just stand there.

1496
00:45:46,660 --> 00:45:47,500
 (laughing)

1497
00:45:47,500 --> 00:45:48,340
 - Just a long blink.

1498
00:45:48,340 --> 00:45:49,940
 - And then four seconds at a time.

1499
00:45:49,940 --> 00:45:50,780
 And you just feel perfect.

1500
00:45:50,780 --> 00:45:51,980
 You'd say you'll never sleep.

1501
00:45:51,980 --> 00:45:52,820
 - Rejuvenate it.

1502
00:45:52,820 --> 00:45:53,660
 - Hustle never sleeps.

1503
00:45:53,660 --> 00:45:55,340
 (laughing)

1504
00:45:55,340 --> 00:45:57,400
 - It'll become a thing.

1505
00:45:57,400 --> 00:46:00,500
 And so yeah, and they go into deep sleep,

1506
00:46:00,500 --> 00:46:01,980
 which I'm not sure we're very good at doing

1507
00:46:01,980 --> 00:46:02,820
 within four seconds,

1508
00:46:02,820 --> 00:46:04,220
 but they looked at their brainwaves.

1509
00:46:04,220 --> 00:46:05,060
 - Wow.

1510
00:46:05,060 --> 00:46:05,900
 - Really?

1511
00:46:05,900 --> 00:46:07,240
 - Yeah, so it was quite difficult.

1512
00:46:07,240 --> 00:46:09,540
 - It's like a bungee jump into sleep and then back.

1513
00:46:09,540 --> 00:46:10,380
 - Yeah.

1514
00:46:10,380 --> 00:46:11,200
 - You just feel so rapid to get there.

1515
00:46:11,200 --> 00:46:12,220
 - Yeah, deep sleep.

1516
00:46:12,220 --> 00:46:15,420
 - But yeah, they go into slow wave sleep.

1517
00:46:15,420 --> 00:46:17,500
 They really rigged them up these penguins.

1518
00:46:17,500 --> 00:46:19,260
 It's amazing they could sleep at all.

1519
00:46:19,260 --> 00:46:21,060
 There was this researcher, Wong Young Lee,

1520
00:46:21,060 --> 00:46:22,300
 who I think was leading the research.

1521
00:46:22,300 --> 00:46:24,260
 You said it was exhausting for them

1522
00:46:24,260 --> 00:46:26,500
 'cause they had to catch 14 penguins

1523
00:46:26,500 --> 00:46:29,260
 and they had to get equipment on their brains

1524
00:46:29,260 --> 00:46:30,740
 to measure their brain activity.

1525
00:46:30,740 --> 00:46:34,140
 And then they had to get accelerometers to see how fast,

1526
00:46:34,140 --> 00:46:35,460
 to like record their muscle movements,

1527
00:46:35,460 --> 00:46:37,720
 see how fast their muscles are moving and their positions.

1528
00:46:37,720 --> 00:46:40,220
 And then they filmed like whether their heads start nodding

1529
00:46:40,220 --> 00:46:41,060
 and then jumping again.

1530
00:46:41,060 --> 00:46:42,400
 - So is it possible that the penguins actually

1531
00:46:42,400 --> 00:46:43,500
 sleep completely normally,

1532
00:46:43,500 --> 00:46:45,180
 but when they're manipulated by scientists,

1533
00:46:45,180 --> 00:46:46,420
 they can't sleep at all?

1534
00:46:46,420 --> 00:46:47,420
 - I think so.

1535
00:46:47,420 --> 00:46:51,700
 They did say this is probably serving the purpose

1536
00:46:51,700 --> 00:46:53,140
 of meaning that they can guard their young.

1537
00:46:53,140 --> 00:46:55,420
 So it's when they guard their newborn children

1538
00:46:55,420 --> 00:46:58,100
 because one parent will be off getting food,

1539
00:46:58,100 --> 00:46:59,820
 the other parent has to look after the kid.

1540
00:46:59,820 --> 00:47:01,620
 So it's like, so you never sleep for so long

1541
00:47:01,620 --> 00:47:02,980
 that the kid can get in trouble.

1542
00:47:02,980 --> 00:47:04,900
 It's like having a baby monitor.

1543
00:47:04,900 --> 00:47:07,500
 And they said it's probably 'cause of that,

1544
00:47:07,500 --> 00:47:09,560
 but it could also be because you know penguins,

1545
00:47:09,560 --> 00:47:10,560
 when they're looking after their young,

1546
00:47:10,560 --> 00:47:12,480
 they hang out in these massive groups

1547
00:47:12,480 --> 00:47:15,160
 of just thousands of them and it's really loud and busy.

1548
00:47:15,160 --> 00:47:16,920
 Like these researchers said we couldn't sleep

1549
00:47:16,920 --> 00:47:19,200
 'cause it was just so hectic there 'cause so many penguins.

1550
00:47:19,200 --> 00:47:20,400
 - These researchers are complaining a lot

1551
00:47:20,400 --> 00:47:21,240
 about their own sleep.

1552
00:47:21,240 --> 00:47:23,400
 I have to say, 'cause someone has to study

1553
00:47:23,400 --> 00:47:24,740
 about something else.

1554
00:47:24,740 --> 00:47:27,480
 (laughing)

1555
00:47:27,480 --> 00:47:29,040
 - Four seconds, I wish.

1556
00:47:29,040 --> 00:47:31,280
 (laughing)

1557
00:47:31,280 --> 00:47:33,680
 But they said it could just be that the penguins

1558
00:47:33,680 --> 00:47:34,840
 can't sleep for longer than that.

1559
00:47:34,840 --> 00:47:36,800
 They might be able to sleep eight hours in a row,

1560
00:47:36,800 --> 00:47:37,900
 but it's just that they've been woken up

1561
00:47:37,900 --> 00:47:40,460
 every four seconds 'cause it's so noisy and bustling.

1562
00:47:40,460 --> 00:47:41,780
 - Right.

1563
00:47:41,780 --> 00:47:42,620
 It is crazy.

1564
00:47:42,620 --> 00:47:44,540
 There are lots of animals in the world

1565
00:47:44,540 --> 00:47:46,820
 that do, when they've had a baby,

1566
00:47:46,820 --> 00:47:48,820
 are forced into a position of just being awake.

1567
00:47:48,820 --> 00:47:51,540
 Like dolphins, for example, are awake for like a month,

1568
00:47:51,540 --> 00:47:52,380
 a full month.

1569
00:47:52,380 --> 00:47:53,500
 They just can't go to sleep

1570
00:47:53,500 --> 00:47:56,580
 'cause their baby dolphins can't sleep.

1571
00:47:56,580 --> 00:47:57,940
 So they're just awake the whole time.

1572
00:47:57,940 --> 00:47:58,780
 - For a month.

1573
00:47:58,780 --> 00:47:59,900
 - Yeah, for a month.

1574
00:47:59,900 --> 00:48:03,140
 And they basically, they just have to be awake

1575
00:48:03,140 --> 00:48:05,780
 and with them, part of the dolphin not being asleep

1576
00:48:05,780 --> 00:48:07,680
 as a baby, as they keep movement,

1577
00:48:07,680 --> 00:48:08,840
 they're building up blubber,

1578
00:48:08,840 --> 00:48:09,920
 they're building up all the things

1579
00:48:09,920 --> 00:48:11,540
 that they need to make them into a bigger dolphin.

1580
00:48:11,540 --> 00:48:13,440
 That's like, and then after like a month or so,

1581
00:48:13,440 --> 00:48:14,600
 they all start sleeping again.

1582
00:48:14,600 --> 00:48:17,120
 But the mum is just solidly awake.

1583
00:48:17,120 --> 00:48:19,600
 - But don't they do the half of their brains at a time thing?

1584
00:48:19,600 --> 00:48:22,080
 - So I'm not sure that, that's what I tried to find out,

1585
00:48:22,080 --> 00:48:23,560
 but I couldn't find anything that said

1586
00:48:23,560 --> 00:48:25,000
 they go to half asleep.

1587
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:27,480
 'Cause yes, dolphins shut half their brain asleep.

1588
00:48:27,480 --> 00:48:28,320
 - Yeah.

1589
00:48:28,320 --> 00:48:29,640
 - As far as I could see, that wasn't part of any of the--

1590
00:48:29,640 --> 00:48:31,040
 - They don't sleep at all, they're not either half.

1591
00:48:31,040 --> 00:48:31,880
 - Yeah.

1592
00:48:31,880 --> 00:48:32,720
 - Blimey.

1593
00:48:32,720 --> 00:48:33,840
 - I don't know about all bears,

1594
00:48:33,840 --> 00:48:35,320
 but don't polar bears do a similar thing

1595
00:48:35,320 --> 00:48:38,620
 where they basically just attach the children

1596
00:48:38,620 --> 00:48:39,740
 to them for the whole time.

1597
00:48:39,740 --> 00:48:42,260
 So the children don't really walk around following them.

1598
00:48:42,260 --> 00:48:44,200
 Like you see elephants, you see them following

1599
00:48:44,200 --> 00:48:46,060
 and stuff like that, but polar bears is just like,

1600
00:48:46,060 --> 00:48:48,980
 you see a picture of a new mum in the polar bear community,

1601
00:48:48,980 --> 00:48:51,180
 there's just kids just like strapped.

1602
00:48:51,180 --> 00:48:52,980
 - And then do they have a walk on a swing to them, is it?

1603
00:48:52,980 --> 00:48:53,820
 - They're just like clinging on.

1604
00:48:53,820 --> 00:48:55,780
 I think they, yeah, I don't think they have papoos.

1605
00:48:55,780 --> 00:48:57,060
 (laughing)

1606
00:48:57,060 --> 00:48:58,780
 But they're just like grabbing hold of them

1607
00:48:58,780 --> 00:49:00,100
 and they just have to walk around with that

1608
00:49:00,100 --> 00:49:02,140
 and then just do everything from there

1609
00:49:02,140 --> 00:49:03,100
 until they like sit down again.

1610
00:49:03,100 --> 00:49:03,940
 - That's so crazy.

1611
00:49:03,940 --> 00:49:04,760
 - 'Cause they just don't walk.

1612
00:49:04,760 --> 00:49:07,200
 - Tassels, it's got a lot of baby tassels.

1613
00:49:07,200 --> 00:49:11,200
 - You know, elephant seals.

1614
00:49:11,200 --> 00:49:15,320
 - Yes, which is a huge, great, massive big things.

1615
00:49:15,320 --> 00:49:18,580
 We got Santa fact, actually, by Victoria Pierdadi.

1616
00:49:18,580 --> 00:49:20,160
 So thank you for that, Victoria.

1617
00:49:20,160 --> 00:49:21,760
 Which is that sleeping elephant seals,

1618
00:49:21,760 --> 00:49:25,800
 they fall through the sea as they nap.

1619
00:49:25,800 --> 00:49:28,760
 So they are mammals, they do not have gills.

1620
00:49:28,760 --> 00:49:31,760
 They can last up to about half an hour underwater,

1621
00:49:31,760 --> 00:49:32,960
 but sometimes they will just nap.

1622
00:49:32,960 --> 00:49:35,200
 And it seems like they just spiral downward

1623
00:49:35,200 --> 00:49:36,880
 through the water asleep.

1624
00:49:36,880 --> 00:49:37,720
 - Wow.

1625
00:49:37,720 --> 00:49:39,800
 - That happens in my brain quite a lot.

1626
00:49:39,800 --> 00:49:41,140
 We've got to get to sleep.

1627
00:49:41,140 --> 00:49:41,980
 You know, when you jolt away

1628
00:49:41,980 --> 00:49:43,080
 'cause you felt like you were falling.

1629
00:49:43,080 --> 00:49:44,800
 - Yeah, yeah.

1630
00:49:44,800 --> 00:49:45,640
 - Well imagine if you woke up

1631
00:49:45,640 --> 00:49:47,920
 and you had actually jolted into the sea.

1632
00:49:47,920 --> 00:49:49,880
 (laughing)

1633
00:49:49,880 --> 00:49:53,160
 - 'Cause it is fast, they drop 400 meters in 10 minutes.

1634
00:49:53,160 --> 00:49:54,320
 Which if you can, that's like,

1635
00:49:54,320 --> 00:49:56,240
 we're talking the highest buildings in the world.

1636
00:49:56,240 --> 00:49:58,800
 That's like the full height of them, almost.

1637
00:49:58,800 --> 00:50:00,400
 And it takes quite a long time.

1638
00:50:00,400 --> 00:50:02,360
 You know, if you go to one of those skyscrapers,

1639
00:50:02,360 --> 00:50:04,400
 the lift takes about that long.

1640
00:50:04,400 --> 00:50:05,240
 - Yeah. - Sometimes.

1641
00:50:05,240 --> 00:50:06,080
 - Yeah, yeah.

1642
00:50:06,080 --> 00:50:06,920
 - So they're going that fast.

1643
00:50:06,920 --> 00:50:07,760
 - Exactly.

1644
00:50:07,760 --> 00:50:09,080
 If you wake up when you've only got three minutes

1645
00:50:09,080 --> 00:50:11,400
 of oxygen left, that's presumably quite stressful.

1646
00:50:11,400 --> 00:50:12,240
 - I would have thought so, yeah.

1647
00:50:12,240 --> 00:50:14,080
 - What's the protocol?

1648
00:50:14,080 --> 00:50:14,920
 What do they do?

1649
00:50:14,920 --> 00:50:15,960
 - You can't really do that dancing

1650
00:50:15,960 --> 00:50:18,000
 of faking that you weren't asleep on the sofa

1651
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:19,600
 during a Sunday afternoon movie.

1652
00:50:19,600 --> 00:50:21,080
 You know, dads will always be like,

1653
00:50:21,080 --> 00:50:22,440
 "I was asleep, I'm watching, I'm watching."

1654
00:50:22,440 --> 00:50:24,280
 - I'm resting my eyes.

1655
00:50:24,280 --> 00:50:25,600
 - Dad, you're at the bottom of the ocean.

1656
00:50:25,600 --> 00:50:28,360
 (laughing)

1657
00:50:28,360 --> 00:50:30,240
 - Does anyone, have you ever met a penguin?

1658
00:50:30,240 --> 00:50:31,080
 - Oh.

1659
00:50:31,080 --> 00:50:32,200
 - 'Cause I've got another clack.

1660
00:50:32,200 --> 00:50:34,160
 - Here we go, here we go.

1661
00:50:34,160 --> 00:50:36,440
 Which of your winter sports were you taking part in

1662
00:50:36,440 --> 00:50:37,640
 with the Olympic team?

1663
00:50:37,640 --> 00:50:39,520
 - Well, I did do the skeleton,

1664
00:50:39,520 --> 00:50:41,560
 which is basically how penguins travel.

1665
00:50:41,560 --> 00:50:42,400
 - Oh, yes.

1666
00:50:42,400 --> 00:50:43,240
 - Did you?

1667
00:50:43,240 --> 00:50:44,400
 - They go, you know, it's like the head first one.

1668
00:50:44,400 --> 00:50:45,240
 - Yeah, yeah.

1669
00:50:45,240 --> 00:50:46,080
 - Holding through the, yeah.

1670
00:50:46,080 --> 00:50:46,920
 - That looks terrifying.

1671
00:50:46,920 --> 00:50:49,400
 - Well, I did it, they train on just, on a track.

1672
00:50:49,400 --> 00:50:51,680
 So just on wheels on track rather than on ice.

1673
00:50:51,680 --> 00:50:52,520
 - Right.

1674
00:50:52,520 --> 00:50:53,360
 - And this is the context where,

1675
00:50:53,360 --> 00:50:54,200
 so there were penguins doing penguins.

1676
00:50:54,200 --> 00:50:55,040
 - No, I did meet penguins actually.

1677
00:50:55,040 --> 00:50:55,880
 - Oh, this is just a bracketed anecdote.

1678
00:50:55,880 --> 00:50:58,400
 - But I did, yeah, yeah, because you mentioned

1679
00:50:58,400 --> 00:51:00,760
 the Winter Olympics and that was penguin adjacent.

1680
00:51:00,760 --> 00:51:02,360
 I met a penguin in Australia actually.

1681
00:51:02,360 --> 00:51:03,200
 - Okay, right.

1682
00:51:03,200 --> 00:51:07,240
 - Man, I can't, I was a child, there are photos of it,

1683
00:51:07,240 --> 00:51:08,920
 but I'm trying to get my head around what it was,

1684
00:51:08,920 --> 00:51:12,840
 because from memory it was like in our hotel,

1685
00:51:12,840 --> 00:51:15,280
 like where the various pools were,

1686
00:51:15,280 --> 00:51:16,120
 there was different pools,

1687
00:51:16,120 --> 00:51:17,400
 but it was presented in a sort of like,

1688
00:51:17,400 --> 00:51:18,240
 go over to this section,

1689
00:51:18,240 --> 00:51:19,680
 it was like a quite kid-friendly hotel,

1690
00:51:19,680 --> 00:51:22,880
 'cause like this section is meant to be the Arctic or whatever.

1691
00:51:22,880 --> 00:51:25,480
 And then in between two of these pools on the walkway

1692
00:51:25,480 --> 00:51:27,480
 were just like this bit where these penguins were.

1693
00:51:27,480 --> 00:51:28,320
 - Right.

1694
00:51:28,320 --> 00:51:29,160
 - And they would do like feedings at a certain time

1695
00:51:29,160 --> 00:51:30,480
 every day, and you could go and hang out.

1696
00:51:30,480 --> 00:51:32,680
 And then I was a penguin of my favorite animal.

1697
00:51:32,680 --> 00:51:34,600
 I was obsessed with penguins as a kid.

1698
00:51:34,600 --> 00:51:36,800
 Penguins is actually one of the many nicknames

1699
00:51:36,800 --> 00:51:39,600
 I tried to start for myself as a child.

1700
00:51:39,600 --> 00:51:40,920
 (laughing)

1701
00:51:40,920 --> 00:51:43,880
 - That's a child, you were 23, weren't you?

1702
00:51:43,880 --> 00:51:45,920
 - That's a child in some communities.

1703
00:51:45,920 --> 00:51:48,960
 And then like I got picked as the volunteer

1704
00:51:48,960 --> 00:51:50,760
 for this sort of penguin feeding.

1705
00:51:50,760 --> 00:51:52,320
 And so I was like doing the whole,

1706
00:51:52,320 --> 00:51:53,440
 you know, I was chucking the fish.

1707
00:51:53,440 --> 00:51:54,280
 - Wow, that's great.

1708
00:51:54,280 --> 00:51:56,720
 - And I shook his fin.

1709
00:51:56,720 --> 00:51:58,560
 - Shook the penguin fin.

1710
00:51:58,560 --> 00:51:59,920
 - What do they have there?

1711
00:51:59,920 --> 00:52:01,400
 - Wing, wing, wing, yeah, wing.

1712
00:52:01,400 --> 00:52:02,400
 Shook his wing, fin.

1713
00:52:02,400 --> 00:52:03,720
 - Shook his fin, yeah.

1714
00:52:03,720 --> 00:52:06,400
 - Shook his wing, yeah.

1715
00:52:06,400 --> 00:52:07,240
 - That's lovely.

1716
00:52:07,240 --> 00:52:08,080
 That's very cool.

1717
00:52:08,080 --> 00:52:10,400
 - And now your DNA is on that penguin.

1718
00:52:10,400 --> 00:52:11,240
 And if it's murdered.

1719
00:52:11,240 --> 00:52:14,400
 - If that penguin goes missing, I'm absolutely shocked.

1720
00:52:14,400 --> 00:52:15,680
 My cat's also a suspect

1721
00:52:15,680 --> 00:52:18,400
 because there's definitely cat hair on that penguin's hand.

1722
00:52:18,400 --> 00:52:22,080
 - Have you seen the penguins at the zoo, the London Zoo?

1723
00:52:22,080 --> 00:52:22,920
 - No.

1724
00:52:22,920 --> 00:52:23,760
 - Oh, well, I recommend.

1725
00:52:23,760 --> 00:52:26,040
 Is there any nearest penguin to us geographically?

1726
00:52:26,040 --> 00:52:28,720
 I don't think you can meet them as far as I'm aware.

1727
00:52:28,720 --> 00:52:30,120
 There was something about them, wasn't there, though?

1728
00:52:30,120 --> 00:52:34,360
 There was something, isn't there, isn't there enclosure?

1729
00:52:34,360 --> 00:52:36,920
 It's the only grade two listed.

1730
00:52:36,920 --> 00:52:38,360
 - Oh yes, it's got that amazing

1731
00:52:38,360 --> 00:52:39,200
 we talked about before.

1732
00:52:39,200 --> 00:52:41,920
 - I was in a Harry Styles video.

1733
00:52:41,920 --> 00:52:42,760
 - Is it?

1734
00:52:42,760 --> 00:52:43,600
 - I think that rings a bell.

1735
00:52:43,600 --> 00:52:44,440
 - I can't get this from different angles.

1736
00:52:44,440 --> 00:52:46,600
 - That enclosure that is grade two listed

1737
00:52:46,600 --> 00:52:48,040
 but that spiral thing in the middle

1738
00:52:48,040 --> 00:52:51,880
 is where the as it was video is filmed.

1739
00:52:51,880 --> 00:52:52,720
 - Has it?

1740
00:52:52,720 --> 00:52:53,960
 - He's like stood on that thing

1741
00:52:53,960 --> 00:52:55,960
 and all these women are sort of circling.

1742
00:52:55,960 --> 00:52:56,800
 - Right.

1743
00:52:56,800 --> 00:52:58,120
 - Are they dressed as penguins?

1744
00:52:58,120 --> 00:52:59,800
 - No, they're wearing tuxedos.

1745
00:52:59,800 --> 00:53:00,880
 - I wonder what they did with the penguins

1746
00:53:00,880 --> 00:53:01,840
 when they were filming that video.

1747
00:53:01,840 --> 00:53:03,120
 - I know, right?

1748
00:53:03,120 --> 00:53:04,200
 I think a lot of people on the internet

1749
00:53:04,200 --> 00:53:05,040
 were wondering that as well.

1750
00:53:05,040 --> 00:53:06,400
 I mean, supposedly it's just a time

1751
00:53:06,400 --> 00:53:07,720
 when they weren't using it.

1752
00:53:07,720 --> 00:53:09,440
 - How can they not be using their main home

1753
00:53:09,440 --> 00:53:10,280
 in enclosure?

1754
00:53:10,280 --> 00:53:11,480
 - The album is called Harry's House.

1755
00:53:11,480 --> 00:53:12,640
 So it does feel like you're marching and we're like,

1756
00:53:12,640 --> 00:53:15,480
 this is Harry's House, let's get out.

1757
00:53:15,480 --> 00:53:17,740
 (laughing)

1758
00:53:17,740 --> 00:53:22,440
 - Something that sleeps quite weirdly is spiders.

1759
00:53:22,440 --> 00:53:25,680
 And they actually are unique in the animal world, I think,

1760
00:53:25,680 --> 00:53:28,000
 in that they don't have the right body clock.

1761
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:31,280
 And they're the only things we know about

1762
00:53:31,280 --> 00:53:32,120
 that don't have the right body clock.

1763
00:53:32,120 --> 00:53:34,960
 So you know, we're all basically 24 hour body clock,

1764
00:53:34,960 --> 00:53:36,680
 although sometimes when people go and live in caves,

1765
00:53:36,680 --> 00:53:38,960
 they sort of stretch to 25 hours or 23 or whatever.

1766
00:53:38,960 --> 00:53:40,640
 But mostly we-

1767
00:53:40,640 --> 00:53:42,280
 - So there was such a dismissive role of the air,

1768
00:53:42,280 --> 00:53:44,440
 like there's a thing that's personally inconvenient

1769
00:53:44,440 --> 00:53:46,280
 to you on more than one occasion.

1770
00:53:46,280 --> 00:53:47,800
 - Those caves are always late.

1771
00:53:47,800 --> 00:53:49,520
 (laughing)

1772
00:53:49,520 --> 00:53:53,120
 - The man is waiting outside the table for two.

1773
00:53:53,120 --> 00:53:53,940
 God's sake.

1774
00:53:53,940 --> 00:53:55,280
 (laughing)

1775
00:53:55,280 --> 00:53:57,960
 - Time, it's a cadian with my arse.

1776
00:53:57,960 --> 00:54:00,080
 - Yeah.

1777
00:54:00,080 --> 00:54:03,960
 - So mostly even bacteria operate on a 24 hour body clock,

1778
00:54:03,960 --> 00:54:06,240
 but spiders don't.

1779
00:54:06,240 --> 00:54:09,400
 And we don't really know why except that they're fucked up.

1780
00:54:09,400 --> 00:54:11,920
 So they have the shortest body clocks ever known.

1781
00:54:11,920 --> 00:54:14,560
 Some spiders have been found to have 17 hour body clocks.

1782
00:54:14,560 --> 00:54:16,360
 But this should really mess with them

1783
00:54:16,360 --> 00:54:18,560
 because so spiders left their own devices.

1784
00:54:18,560 --> 00:54:21,720
 And these are specifically trash line orb weavers,

1785
00:54:21,720 --> 00:54:22,760
 which sounds-

1786
00:54:22,760 --> 00:54:23,600
 - Slam.

1787
00:54:23,600 --> 00:54:24,440
 - Yeah.

1788
00:54:24,440 --> 00:54:25,680
 - I mean, rows of it or what?

1789
00:54:25,680 --> 00:54:26,520
 (laughing)

1790
00:54:26,520 --> 00:54:27,360
 - They're actually called that

1791
00:54:27,360 --> 00:54:29,920
 'cause they hide in their webs in a pile of crap.

1792
00:54:29,920 --> 00:54:34,380
 So they like will put dead bodies and feces and dirt

1793
00:54:34,380 --> 00:54:36,340
 in their web and then they hide amongst it.

1794
00:54:36,340 --> 00:54:37,180
 - Wow.

1795
00:54:37,180 --> 00:54:38,260
 It's not dissimilar to my room.

1796
00:54:38,260 --> 00:54:40,120
 (laughing)

1797
00:54:40,120 --> 00:54:42,480
 - And that's how you catch flies.

1798
00:54:42,480 --> 00:54:44,580
 Anyway, they need to wake up at night

1799
00:54:44,580 --> 00:54:46,160
 and get super super active in the dark.

1800
00:54:46,160 --> 00:54:48,280
 And they spin their webs at nighttime.

1801
00:54:48,280 --> 00:54:50,560
 And they erect this big pile of trash to live in.

1802
00:54:50,560 --> 00:54:53,200
 And then in the daytime, spiders fall asleep still,

1803
00:54:53,200 --> 00:54:54,700
 which is why when you see them in daylight,

1804
00:54:54,700 --> 00:54:56,920
 they're usually just motionless.

1805
00:54:56,920 --> 00:54:59,200
 And then they go nuts at night in the dark.

1806
00:54:59,200 --> 00:55:03,500
 But it turns out if you subject a spider to full darkness,

1807
00:55:03,500 --> 00:55:05,640
 it starts waking up and weaving its web,

1808
00:55:05,640 --> 00:55:08,720
 web many hours before night would actually fall.

1809
00:55:08,720 --> 00:55:11,760
 So it wakes up like on the 17 hour mark

1810
00:55:11,760 --> 00:55:13,720
 rather than on the 24 hour mark.

1811
00:55:13,720 --> 00:55:16,600
 So that means they're constantly kind of jet lagged, right?

1812
00:55:16,600 --> 00:55:17,440
 - Right.

1813
00:55:17,440 --> 00:55:18,840
 - They're constantly, their bodies are going,

1814
00:55:18,840 --> 00:55:20,200
 hey, we've got to wake up now.

1815
00:55:20,200 --> 00:55:21,800
 And then it's like, no, no, no, you've got to stay asleep

1816
00:55:21,800 --> 00:55:23,160
 'cause it's not night yet.

1817
00:55:23,160 --> 00:55:25,240
 And then night comes and then they have to go to sleep

1818
00:55:25,240 --> 00:55:26,760
 and they're wide awake.

1819
00:55:26,760 --> 00:55:28,760
 But they manage to just reset themselves every day.

1820
00:55:28,760 --> 00:55:30,200
 - Do they get cranky?

1821
00:55:30,200 --> 00:55:32,400
 - Well, maybe that's why they're such bastards.

1822
00:55:32,400 --> 00:55:34,200
 And they're always eating each other

1823
00:55:34,200 --> 00:55:36,520
 and hanging out in the corner of the room

1824
00:55:36,520 --> 00:55:37,760
 to deliberately scaring people.

1825
00:55:37,760 --> 00:55:39,120
 - Oh, I feel for them.

1826
00:55:39,120 --> 00:55:40,360
 That sounds very rough.

1827
00:55:40,360 --> 00:55:41,200
 - Doesn't it?

1828
00:55:41,200 --> 00:55:43,920
 - But apparently you can't catch up on sleep anyway, right?

1829
00:55:43,920 --> 00:55:46,480
 There's a myth, the whole idea of like,

1830
00:55:46,480 --> 00:55:47,680
 I only got six hours sleep last night

1831
00:55:47,680 --> 00:55:49,560
 so I'm going to now have 10 hours sleep or whatever.

1832
00:55:49,560 --> 00:55:50,400
 It's a myth.

1833
00:55:50,400 --> 00:55:51,240
 - Is that a myth?

1834
00:55:51,240 --> 00:55:54,520
 - You're better off just having seven or eight every time.

1835
00:55:54,520 --> 00:55:57,960
 So you can't, it's impossible to catch up on sleep.

1836
00:55:57,960 --> 00:55:59,880
 - What, you'll always be a bit more tired?

1837
00:55:59,880 --> 00:56:02,040
 - No, you just don't, yeah, so I don't mean,

1838
00:56:02,040 --> 00:56:03,600
 it's impossible to go, this economy,

1839
00:56:03,600 --> 00:56:05,760
 it's bloody impossible to catch up on sleep.

1840
00:56:05,760 --> 00:56:08,400
 I just mean that it actually makes it worse.

1841
00:56:08,400 --> 00:56:09,240
 - Really?

1842
00:56:09,240 --> 00:56:10,680
 - So it's like, it's not a cult or tally

1843
00:56:10,680 --> 00:56:12,040
 for the week where you're trying to get us.

1844
00:56:12,040 --> 00:56:14,520
 It's like, no, just every day try and get seven or eight.

1845
00:56:14,520 --> 00:56:18,000
 - Oh, I did not know how to improve it with ten.

1846
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:19,800
 - 'Cause the way to avoid being underslept

1847
00:56:19,800 --> 00:56:21,320
 is then just have seven or eight hours, rather than-

1848
00:56:21,320 --> 00:56:22,160
 - Yeah, yeah.

1849
00:56:22,160 --> 00:56:24,560
 - Yeah, yeah, 'cause I assumed it was the other thing.

1850
00:56:24,560 --> 00:56:25,400
 - Me too.

1851
00:56:25,400 --> 00:56:28,440
 - That there's a ratchet and it only gets worse for your life.

1852
00:56:28,440 --> 00:56:30,440
 - Exactly, but it's not like there's a certain amount

1853
00:56:30,440 --> 00:56:33,160
 of hours you must sleep in your life.

1854
00:56:33,160 --> 00:56:34,520
 And if you're not getting to the total,

1855
00:56:34,520 --> 00:56:36,360
 like you're filling it in like one of those thermometers

1856
00:56:36,360 --> 00:56:38,320
 and at school when you're trying to get donations.

1857
00:56:38,320 --> 00:56:39,520
 - Well, you can actually trick yourself

1858
00:56:39,520 --> 00:56:41,640
 into thinking you've had more sleep, can't you?

1859
00:56:41,640 --> 00:56:44,200
 Remember we did that thing about the placebo sleep

1860
00:56:44,200 --> 00:56:45,840
 experiment that was done in America

1861
00:56:45,840 --> 00:56:48,320
 where they told people that they'd had more sleep

1862
00:56:48,320 --> 00:56:50,680
 than they actually had and they performed better in tasks.

1863
00:56:50,680 --> 00:56:52,080
 - I always use this as a life hack

1864
00:56:52,080 --> 00:56:53,280
 to try and tell myself every morning

1865
00:56:53,280 --> 00:56:54,480
 I've had loads of sleep if I haven't.

1866
00:56:54,480 --> 00:56:55,320
 - Do you?

1867
00:56:55,320 --> 00:56:56,140
 - It hasn't worked yet, yeah.

1868
00:56:56,140 --> 00:56:56,980
 - All right.

1869
00:56:56,980 --> 00:56:58,440
 - You need someone else to tell you that.

1870
00:56:58,440 --> 00:57:00,160
 In order for you to actually believe it, right?

1871
00:57:00,160 --> 00:57:01,000
 - Yeah.

1872
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:01,840
 - 'Cause it was work.

1873
00:57:01,840 --> 00:57:02,680
 - 'Cause you know what, yeah.

1874
00:57:02,680 --> 00:57:03,520
 - But how can you ever do that?

1875
00:57:03,520 --> 00:57:05,000
 'Cause if you're employing someone to do that,

1876
00:57:05,000 --> 00:57:05,840
 you would also know.

1877
00:57:05,840 --> 00:57:06,680
 - Exactly.

1878
00:57:06,680 --> 00:57:07,520
 - Yeah.

1879
00:57:07,520 --> 00:57:10,680
 - It's like, if your phone told you, I'd believe it.

1880
00:57:10,680 --> 00:57:12,000
 - Yeah, those apps sleep apps should just lie.

1881
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:13,320
 - Exactly, they should just lie.

1882
00:57:13,320 --> 00:57:14,800
 - And everyone gets so much more done.

1883
00:57:14,800 --> 00:57:15,880
 - Maybe they are lying.

1884
00:57:15,880 --> 00:57:16,960
 'Cause they wouldn't tell us, would they?

1885
00:57:16,960 --> 00:57:18,000
 'Cause that defeats the object.

1886
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:19,560
 So perhaps that's what they're--

1887
00:57:19,560 --> 00:57:21,320
 - I bet if you have it and you work for the app,

1888
00:57:21,320 --> 00:57:23,000
 it always tells you that you got loads of sleep.

1889
00:57:23,000 --> 00:57:23,840
 - Yeah.

1890
00:57:23,840 --> 00:57:25,600
 - Just so that you're more productive in the day.

1891
00:57:25,600 --> 00:57:26,920
 For everyone else, I think, do what you want.

1892
00:57:26,920 --> 00:57:28,520
 And if they know from your phone

1893
00:57:28,520 --> 00:57:30,240
 that you work for a rival app--

1894
00:57:30,240 --> 00:57:31,080
 - Yeah, if you work for someone--

1895
00:57:31,080 --> 00:57:31,920
 (all laughing)

1896
00:57:31,920 --> 00:57:34,320
 - They just go, "Sorry, mate, that was terrible."

1897
00:57:34,320 --> 00:57:35,160
 You're knackered.

1898
00:57:35,160 --> 00:57:36,000
 (all laughing)

1899
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:36,840
 You look awful.

1900
00:57:36,840 --> 00:57:39,420
 (upbeat music)

1901
00:57:39,740 --> 00:57:42,340
 (upbeat music)

1902
00:57:42,340 --> 00:57:44,300
 - Okay, that's it.

1903
00:57:44,300 --> 00:57:45,380
 That is all of our facts.

1904
00:57:45,380 --> 00:57:46,620
 Thank you so much for listening.

1905
00:57:46,620 --> 00:57:48,580
 If you'd like to get in contact with any of us

1906
